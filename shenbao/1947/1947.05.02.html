<h3>張羣出席立院報告闡明今後施政標的　國內糾紛分能根本解決</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕張院長一日晨首次列席立法院，答復立委質詢時，再三那重聲明新政府將從多方面努力，使政府因戡亂而不得已採取之軍事揹施能迅速結束，俾早日用政洽方法根本解決國內糾紛，恢復統一。張氏鄭重指出，政治，　經濟互爲因果，無法詳爲區分。政治問題若不解決，平衡預算，整理幣制，平抑物價，皆難見諸實現。和平與統一爲一事，民主法治亦無區分，今後政院種種措施，經濟政治將同樣重視，於內閣將忠實勇敢執行國務會議之決策，盡力倣去，並願採納各方高見，以爲旅政參考。張氏向立院全體保蹬行政與立法今後將處於相輔相成之地位，政院願意接受法律約束，絕對重視制衡原理，決不致有行政不顧立法情事。張否認目前政府僅爲由訓政至憲政時期之過渡機構，並舉例說明稱：政府以一汽車界余，命余載運建設憲政之圖案赴國民大會堂，以爲將來建設憲政民主政府之張本，今不問此車機械如何，然駕駛者技藝僅限於此，而沿途又復障碍重重，自出發至終點途中，駕駛者除須一路修車外，尙須舖路，築橋，一般所謂「過渡」，意義或即如此。張氏認我國經濟建設應以自力更生爲主，不宜專賴外來助力，張以頗具自信之口吻稱：「我物資充沛，財源豐富，若能發揮潛在能力，自力更生，實非難事，天助自助者，一味唯外力是賴，一若無外債即無辦法，此種依賴心理，應早祛除，」張認過去之經濟緊急措施方案對本年二月經濟危機之渡過，實大有效，若無此一措施，今日局勢或尙不能如此，惟指出當局對公務員目前生活因難時在注意中，據謂：公敎人員待遇自去歲十二月調整以來，前後已歷五個月，經此長時期迄未增加之原因，爲自經濟緊急措施方案實施後，生活指數已吿凍結，同時，當局又實施實物配給辦法，此二辦法或足彌補一部份，現物價雖上漲不已，然主要者僅爲米糧，其他油鑒等項實行配給，或足解決一部份，當局非不擬加以調整，然考慮此一問題時，同時聯想及下列數點，（一）士兵待遇，（二）中央及省級以外各級公敎人員待過應否同時調整，（三）國營事業員工待遇，較優於其他公務員，然較諸一般民營事業員工相差仍鉅，似亦應予顧及，當局現正蒐集此類材料，俾爲他日調整之參考。</p>
<p>整理幣制遲早實行緊急措施考慮修改</p>
<p>對各立委所提整理幣制一點，張認各國於大戰之後，其幣制皆須改革，我國自不能例外，故整理幣制爲遲早必行之事，目前之問題，何時始予實行，並實行而有效，此事務求其早日實現，蓋財政經濟難關之打開，應以改革幣制爲前提，而改革幣制尤應以穩定幣値爲其先決條件。張又於答復質詢時稱：政府對信用極重視，自不肯輕易失信於民，同時對「才盡其用」一點，亦當特別重視。張今日答復質詢時，態度誠摯，出語渾厚，處處不脫政治家，實行家態度，絕無慮矯習氣，予立院全體以絕佳印象。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕行政院長張羣一日初次列席立法院會議，報吿施政方針稱：緊急經濟措施，不足應付經濟現况，故政府經濟當局已在檢討中。是項措施，彷彿經濟戒嚴令，其性質之苛刻，人民不能永久忍受，政府將週密研究是項措施，然後决定加以修改或廢止。經濟緊急措施實施時，雖能暫時遏止物價上漲，但終未能凍結物價及保持公務人員之待遇標準，政府已考慮調整公敎人員俸給，同時務使物價不受影響。</p>
<h3>張院長報告全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕首次出席立院報吿之張羣院長，今於其歷時約廿五分鐘之致詞中，對行政，立法兩政權之述用關係，有精闢之闡述，並强調呼籲立院與政院之合作，張氏首提出當前施政應行注意的重點以及關於經濟與一般行政所必須採取的行動與作風，渠謂：在這由訓政過渡到憲政的階段，行政院的任務，是要忠實而有效的執行，國務會議遵奉三民生義的最高指導原則，根據和平建國綢領的精神及各黨派共同協議的新政府施政方針所決定的國策，這從新政府施政方針第五條中「行政院臘依國府委員會之決策負執行之全責」的規定上看，很爲明顯，當然，在執行過程中，我們有時要擬定法律案或預算案提到貴院，有時要自行制頒若干實施細則，有時須要針對環境，分別緩急輕重，酌定實施步驟，並且有時要根據現實需要或困難，建議到國務會議，請求決策，或者請求貴院討論，但凡此種種，只是執行國策所應有的過程，若從法律觀點講，行政院的使命，仍只是如何忠實的執行國策，也就是如何將貴院依照國策所制定的法律澈底予以實施。行政院不能也不應於旣定國策和現行法律之外有所舉措，因爲不如此，便不是民主，不是法治所謂「賢者不能越權而爲善，不尚者不能遠法而行惡」，這兩句話很可以說明法治的精神，也很足以說明行政院的立塲，所以我願意負責的聲明，依法忠實而有效的執行國務會議的決策，就是我們今後施政的規矩準繩，我們願意以此自律，也要以這種精神來督率全國各級行政機關。</p>
<p>闡術施政重點促進生產建設</p>
<p>關於施政重點，張氏重申其於四月廿三日向全國同胞廣播之各點，對經濟問題則提出其廣播之治標，治本辦法，幷進一步的說明謂，無論治標，治本，我們認爲都有設置一綜合的必要，因爲經常的行政組織都以各種專門行政業務或技術爲劃分的標準，在行政院各部會中，其職堂與經濟事項有關的部會有七八個單位之多，這在經常政務或個別業務的處理，當然不成問題，但一談到穩定物價，促進生產建設這類重要迫切而內容廣泛的問題，每一措施動輙涉及若干部會，例如以管制物價論，至少與糧食，財政，交通，社會，經濟等部有關，倘如沒有一個組織加强各部會間的密切聯緊，其舉措步調就不容易求得一致，結果一定會影響到政策的執行。至於在促進生產建設的工作之中，這種配合更爲重要，所以我們在經濟問題極端嚴重的今日，必須要集合社會中各有關業務或技術的專家和政府中各主管機關，使其得在一個組織，一定政策及分工合作的原則之下，集思廣益，配合無間，共同努力，這個組織雖是政府提出，但重心却在於社會工商事業家和專門經濟人才，倘不如此，使難於應付當前嚴重的局面，更談不到有計劃的改革。過去行政院提議設置全國經濟委員會，我們認爲這個組織是必要的，尙望各位予以支持，早日通過。</p>
<p>行政院的任務忠實執行決策</p>
<p>張氏繼提出一般行政問題，謂在準備實施憲政的今日，本人以爲最要緊的還是建立制度，發揮制衡作用，並提倡崇法務實的精神，我在前面已經向各位報吿，在現階段中，行政院的使命。是如何依法忠實而有效的督導並執行國務會議的決策，在這裏我們不能不坦白承認在過去抗戰期間法令的執行，因爲物質條件的缺乏和公務員生活的不安定，以及其它種種內在的或臨時的關係，並未能百分之百的澈底實施，因此，曾惹起若干方面的指摘與批評，誰都知道，國策的執行，在完成立法手續之後，即成爲技術問題，換句話說，國策制成法律以後，緊接着便是執行，而在執行的時候，着重之點便在於方法，應該注意如何執行，才能有效的達成國策的目的，措施稍一不愼，便足以减少法律的威信，或甚至妨碍其實施，我們旣責在執行，自當盡最大努力，克服一切不良的環境，以求國策和法律的有效而澈底的實施。倘因時勢的演變，致法律與現實脫節，行政機關已無力克服其困難時，當然就要請求國務會議對於決策本身重加考慮，或請求貴院在法律方面加以補充或修正，藉符現實的需要，幷可避免因不切實際而引起的下級政府對於法律的漠視或敎衍。</p>
<p>政院立院關係具有相成作用</p>
<p>渠繼闡明行政院和立法院的關係稱：許多人以爲，這兩院是對立的，廿四日某報在「國務會議速寫」標題下說：「孫科張羣對面而坐，象徵着今後政治是代議與責任內閣的交洗，兩人少不了要針鋒相對」，從通常用語來看，所謂「對立」或「針鋒相對」，也許會引起若干人的誤會，但如從政治上制衡原則來講，這兩院實具有相成的作用，兩個機關是並立的，而不是對立的，因爲立院討論政院提案的時候，爲明瞭提案的動機和其可能的效果，當然不能不反覆研討，　以決定其應否成立。至於法律旣經公布之後，原立法機關自亦不能不注意其實施狀况，藉爲將來立法或修正的參考，因爲必如此，才能養成社會對於法律的重視和法治精神，坦率說來，政院應絕對接受法律的羈束，同時，亦希望貴院諒解其困難，幷信賴其經騐和誠意。我們對於制衡原理，絕對重視，願意依照新政府施政方針第五條末段的規定，保持行政與立法之密切關係。</p>
<p>氏末謂：總之，在這未來八個月中，政府一方面要完成行憲準備工作，同時更急於要恢復國家統一和安定，並解決目前嚴重的財政經濟問題，行政工作實在萬分艱鉅，今後要隨時向各位領敎，幷請求協助。當前物價問題，極爲嚴重，各位委員必極關懷，也必然有很好的意見，所以今天已經邀同與經濟特別是物價問題有關的各部會長官同時列席，尙希不吝指敎。</p>

<h3>各立委提出質詢問題　集中於政治經濟　空氣和睦爲民主闢坦途</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立法院一日晨開會時，各立委向政院張院長及谷部負責人所提問題，生要集中政治，經濟兩方面，問亦有詢及當前軍事情况者，各立委代表民衆發言，對新政院莫不寄予重大期望。對張氏一反過去執政者作風，慨然列席立院，咸表感謝。各立委最所關心者，爲新政院性質問題，鍾天心等立委咸認，新政院爲一政治性政府，在政治上只許成功，不許失敗，盼能以百分八十之努力，謀求和平統一之實現，和平若能實現，其他不難迎刃而解。簡貫三重視經濟問題，認此爲新政府最重大之考騐盼新政府能不怕得罪巨室，並勿向豪門巨富妥協。陳顧遠等爲一般公敎人員與留學生呼籲，呂復希望能尊重人民身體自由，切實實行憲法第二，第八條之規定，在實行民主上互相競賽。司徒德等委員亦各就政治經濟問題提出意見，並表示立院與政院互爲表裏，且同向民衆負責，應共同努力，而下宜處於對立地位。今日各立委發言，威心平氣和，張院長亦表示今後將不時蒞院聆敎，會中空氣和睦，且時聞掌聲，一般相信，今後立法與行政關係，當下難水乳交融，爲我國民主憲政闢一坦途。</p>

<h3>柯克上將對記者稱　美軍在華並無基地　青島爲中國港口美海軍無權封閉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍上將柯克，昨在華懋飯店舉行記者招待會，由各報記者提出問題，柯克上將逐一答覆。茲誌其重要者如下：（一）外傳美海軍將封閉靑島港口，實屬不確。靑島係中國之港口，美海軍無權封閉。（二）美最近贈與中國之船艦，其中九十七艘係贈與海軍，均有雷達及全部武器配備，另一百卅六艘小型船只供海關使用，須由中國政府付値。軍艦之交接尙無確期，固尙待中國海軍人員訓練完成。此項船隻有一部份現已由中國方面使用，相信不久將來，對該項船隻之移交，必有詳細辦法，美海軍在靑島，仍協助訓練中國海軍，中國在靑島之海軍訓練團，甚有進步。柯克繼稱，外方曾誤稱靑島爲美海軍基地，此實不確。美海軍在中國並無基地，在靑島方面只是協動訓練中國海軍而已。（三）謠傳有軍火經靑島偸運至共產黨區域，渠不信此係事實。（四）關於莫斯科方面指責靑島美海軍侮辱蘇聯僑民之事，柯克解釋稱，係因美海軍收回若干蘇僑佔住之房屋，供海軍家屬及訓練中國海軍之人員居住。此項房屋前經盟軍方面准蘇僑居住，惟早已滿期。（五）北平方面美海軍已全部撤離，惟地面部隊則因運輸工具問題，目前尙未全撤。柯克上將結束談話後，即在華懋飯店舉行鷄尾酒會，招待新聞界及美海軍在滬人員，並介紹美海軍新任駐滬新聞聯絡處主任杜飛少校Duffy與各方人士見面，蓋原任駐滬新處主任奧少Author即將離軍職，會間歡叙，空氣至爲融洽，至下午六時方散，柯克上將定二日晨離滬返靑島。</p>
<h3>憲政促進會四委會　舉行聯席會議</h3>

<h3>社論　瞭望蘇省行政會議</h3>
<p>江蘇省三十六年度第一次全省行政會議，已於昨日在鎭江開幕了；各區行政督察專員暨全省各縣縣長，均自各地前往省城出席會議，聞會期定爲五日，將討論民政，財政，田糧，敎育，建設，公益，民生，治安，兵役暨地方自治等項問題。王懋功主席昨致開幕詞，特別强調政治應配合軍事收復，而力求地方治安與秩序之恢復；蔣主席也在百忙之中，頒發書面訓詞，以「獎勵生產，力維治安，推進地方自治，準備實施憲政」。等語，勗勉全省行政長官；可知這次全省行政啊議的召開，實有非常重大的意義。我們雖置身都市之中，最近又因爲國事的紛紜莫解，國際政治的波瀾迭起，我們的視綫，常常注射到國內外局勢的發展；但是我們的內心，無時不懷念着地方，尤其是對於江蘇省的政治最爲我們所關切。所以我們對於江蘇全省行政會議的召開，不僅十二分的重視；而且也抱着極大的期望。</p>
<p>江蘇省，不論從地理的，經濟的，人文的角度去觀察，都可以分爲兩個截然不同的區械；一個是蘇北，一個是江南。這兩個區域，雖然僅有長江一水之隔；但是很少相似之點，幾乎是毫無關係的兩個單位。在抗戰勝利之後，蘇北與江南，因爲共產黨的問題更加變爲兩個截然不同的世界；在江南，經過八年抗戰之後，雖然也已糜爛不堪，但在政府的統治之下，只要能遇到廉潔賢明的地方長官，政治條明，與民休息，就不難使江南從戰爭的灰燼逐漸蘇醒過來。但是在蘇北，抗戰雖然勝利，但是蘇北的仍沒有光復，仍遭受中共的茶毒與摧殘，甚至超過敵寇的蹂躪；現在終算山國軍收復了，日月重光了，但是瞻望蘇北，一片焦土，滿目瘡痍，各行政區及其各縣的行政，怎樣能够配合軍事收復？又怎樣能把蘇北的善良無無的同胞，從水深火熟之中振救出來呢？據王懋功主席報吿：「魯省匪氛一日不靖，則蘇北危械一日不止。故第六第八兩行政專員未克出席會議」。蘇北形勢至今仍極嚴重，在這一段簡單的報告中，也可以看出來了。</p>
<p>從此說來，江蘇的地方行政，因爲蘇北與江南的不同，絕對需要實行「因地制宜」的辦法。以目前實際情形的需要而論，蘇北應力求政治與軍事收復的配合，使其恢復秩序與治安；此在江南，則應力謀地方經濟的繁榮。王主席在行政會議席上，高呼治安第一，似乎太偏於蘇北了。我們在這裏不能不指出，如果江南至今還不能安定，仍要高唱治安第一，則江南實在太可悲哀的了。王懋功氏主特蘇政，將近兩年了；若對於江南各縣的行政，至今仍將其重點放在治安方面，則其兩年來的政績如何，也就不言可知了。正因爲我們重視蘇省的行政，也正因爲我們特別關注蘇省的前途，使我們不得不乘全省行政會議討論各縣行政之際，略述我們所見到的地方，聊供出席會議的各位地方長官參攷。</p>
<p>第一，關於蘇北收復區的地方行政，應如何配合軍事收復？我們認爲最重要的首在收拾人心。在民主世紀的今日，在野的政黨若欲奪取政權，固須收拾人心。獲得大多數人民的擁護與愛戴之後，始能取得政權。這是民主政治的不二法則。就是在朝的政然，欲鞏固其旣得之政權，也要能够維繫人心，使其不致潰散。中國共產黨問題的發生，我們反躬自省，不能不承認自己的不長進，致使共產黨能以貪汚腐敗作爲向人民宣傳的工具；中共控制下地區的行政，固不見得十分高明，但是一般老百姓終是不易分明的。現在蘇北的人民，經渦中共管轄之後，又歸政府統治了，政治的好壞，在身受其治者，一定能洞若觀火。蘇北的人民都是善良的愛國的老百姓，在中共管轄下的時候，就渴望着中央的統治，現在光復了，他們的希望實現了，但是收復後的地方行政，千萬不能再使他們失望了，所以蘇北行政的得失，不獨與江蘇一省有關，而且與整個政局有關。但是如何收拾人心？決非草草恢復秩序與治安，所能奏效的，我們希望蘇省行政會議，對於這一點能注意及此。</p>
<p>第二是江南，向來是物產豐富的富庶之區，經過八年的抗戰，雖已糜爛不堪，欲恢復元氣，固然不是一件容易事情；但是事在人爲，江南靠了它的天然資源，只要地方長官都能愛民如子，深知老百姓的痛苦所在，在積極方面，獎勵生產，維持治安，使人民都能安居樂業；在消極方面，與民休息，少做幾件苛擾人民的事情。如此江南就不難恢復舊觀了，至於地方的應興應革，固須視其緩急，先後辦理；切不可好高騖遠，使有所興革，均爲與民生無益的措施。各區行政專員暨各縣縣長，均來自民問，深知民間疾苦，對於地方應興應革之事項，自不致高談關論，不切邊際；目下地方行政的當務之亟，首在謀得人民的安居樂業，從而培養人民的元氣，民生蘇醒，則地方繁榮，自可接踵而至。</p>
<p>第三，今年是我國的憲政實施年，國民大會所通過的憲法，將在今年十二月廿五日實施，而憲政的基礎，首在地方自治，尤其是縣，實爲自治單位的基層組織；所以地方政治搞得不好，則憲政就等於在空中建築樓閣；而國民大會代表與立法委員；不久就要舉行普選，而且候選人也已在開始準備競選；但是各地方的人民，對於選舉·罷免·創制·複決等四種政權，若不知如何行使？則舉行普選的眞正意義，也就要大打折扣，而我們空言實施憲政，對於眞正的民主政治，　也是毫無裨益的。所以我們認爲地方，在此行憲的過渡期，應積極進行準備實施憲政的工作，庶不負蔣主席「推進地方自治，準備實施憲政」的期望。</p>
<p>要之，江蘇是我國首善之區，主持蘇省應把江蘇建設爲全國的模範省，它的成敗，不獨有關江蘇一省，而且與全國的地方政治也有非常密切的關係。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社弗魯辛草地三十日電〕聯大會特別會議指導委會本日午後七時十五分舉行會議，由巴西代表亞朗哈主席，並邀請阿拉伯代表參加討論。中國代表郭泰祺發言，堅決反對阿拉伯代表所提出之要求，並謂余不相信巴勒斯坦獨立爲此一問題唯一解決辦法，唯有對於有利於聯合國各國暨有關各國之建議，始可提出澈底加以討論，對聯大會應俟至事實調查委會提出報吿書後，於九月間舉行大會，經澈底討論後，始可通過決議，職是之故，余不能擁護阿拉伯代表之請求將其提議列入特別會議之議程內。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐紐約十日電〕郭泰祺本日語中國記者稱，渠相信此次會議將限於討論建議巴勒斯坦調查委會之組織及其參考條款。郭氏繼稱，甚多國家之代表團均同意中國之意見，認爲目前大會討論巴勒斯坦問題之實質，尙非其時，因此種問題極端複雜，需要審愼之客觀研究。郭氏稱，就中國而言，中國代表團贊成對巴勒斯坦猶太人與阿拉伯人，及其他有關方面，均爲公正之和平解決。</p>

<h3>聯合國安理會決定發表　參謀委會報告書　國際警務軍能否成立尚待磋商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山一日廣播：聯合國安全理事會今一致通過發表其軍事參謀委會有關建立國際警備軍之第一次報吿。發表日期爲本星期六，星期日見報。該委會認爲此項報吿並無秘密性，故决予以公開發表。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約一日電〕據消息靈通人士談稱：聯合國軍事參謀委員會之報吿書，列舉五强對於今後聯合國軍隊實力所持之各種不同見解，但因若干問題，牽涉政治關係，故將聽由安全理事會就此種意見不同之點，採取決定。五强雖一致同意有編制國際軍隊之必要，但蘇聯認爲各國應依照其責任之重輕，決定其參加國際軍隊之多寡，應以軍事力量成正比例。至於國際軍之駐紥地點，五强對此共有三種不同之見解：（一）中英美三國認爲凡參加國際軍之各國所能合法前往之各處，均得駐紮國際軍；（二）蘇聯認爲國際軍之駐紮地點，應以以前敵國之領土及領海爲限；（三）法國認爲國際軍不僅應駐在前敵國及託管地，抑且亦經由自由成立協議，駐紥若干聯合國會員國之領土內。此外法國並建議軍略區，亦應由國際軍加以佔領云。</p>

<h3>美國外救濟法案　衆院通過修正案　將三億五千萬元改爲二億元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕衆議院今日以三三三票對六十六票，通過對外救濟法修正案，將三億五千萬元之救濟費，减爲二億元，現已送交參議院討論，政府希望能恢復原數，參院外交委員會已全體一致核准三億五千萬元之全部經費。衆院通過之修正案規定，受救濟國家大致以中國，義大利，希臘，奧地利，匃牙利與波蘭爲限。任何政府凡受蘇聯支配者，均不能獲得救濟，除非各該國同意嚴格管制救濟物品，監督實際分配。救濟款項中以一千五百萬元充特里埃斯特等地救濟費。另有一千五百萬元撥充聯合國機構兒童救濟基金。救濟物品至少有百分之九十應在美國購買。自現行生產中抽付賠償之國家不准獲得美國救濟。美國報紙有權報道救濟品之分配情形，不受新聞檢查。救濟品分亂管理事宜，由獨立性之對外救濟機關，而不由國務院主持。</p>

<p>〔合衆社新德里三十日電〕印制憲議會頃已通過印度聯邦憲法內關於保障人民言論與出版自由及機會均等之條款。</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里三十日電〕制憲議會昨日通過取締「　觸主義」，保障基本人權。規定凡遵行此種主義渚構成刑事罪，該款並將建議載入印度新憲法。按藥觸主義純係社會習俗，現行法律並無制裁。根據最近戶口調查結果，四千九百萬印度教徒屬於所謂「登記類」，禁止與平常敎徒與之接觸者則在其內，確數不詳。禁觸主義僅適用於担任極卑賤工作之下等人民，如淸道夫等，彼等不得進入普通寺院，如觸　或擴近印度當人即屬不敬。南部尤其嚴格，並「目賭」亦在禁止之列。若干　區規定彼等在公共街道上與高等印人間所應保持之距離，臨近之時須先吿知。社會與宗敎特權不能享受，居住鄕村，自成一區，與外界隔離。其中多數已改信基督敎或回敎，因其一視同仁之故。</p>

<h3>美國援助希臘計劃　期限應延長至五年　美經濟代表團團長主張</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅日電〕美國訪希經濟代表國團長波德前赴希臘考察該國經濟情形，早已爲五年，俾對於該國之將來能有所保證。希臘在過去二年內雖曾取得價値七萬萬美元之外國援助，但若欲繼續生存，殆諸多困難，希望美國在一九四八年六月貸款屆滿之後，毋需再直接　助希臘，但仍可由美國本身或聯合國機構以另一種方式予以援助。爲欲支持希臘之民氣起見，余主張美國應表示其繼續援助希臘之意見。</p>
<p>至於美國組織一委員會負責監視美國援助之分配，余意此一委員會之人數，應力求其少。希臘向外國購買貨物，應由美希兩國政府暨美商及希臘進口商在美國政府管制之下負責辦理，但監視委員會亦應取得廣泛之權力。至於軍事委員會則必須與希臘陸軍及英國駐軍完全趨於一致，且應與美國陸海軍兩部保持聯絡云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕美國經濟代表團團長波德估計復興希臘五年計劃所需經費約三億三千五百萬美元，繼建議可由其他國家分坦一億四千萬美元，並估計明年單爲維持適當之軍事設備約儲一億八千萬美元。</p>
<h3>法內閣又臨危機　工人要求加薪引起裂痕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三十日電〕法國潛伏之政治危機現又顯露，內閣今日討論藍諾汽車廠工潮問題，共黨閣員五人支持工人加薪要求未成，憤而退席，多數議員預料內閣明夜舉行特別會議時，共黨將宣布退出政府。急進社會黨某議員稱，美國杜魯門總統之援助希土計劃，引起法國反共派排斥共黨而組織新政府之嘗試，閣潮似屬不可避免云。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三十日電〕可靠方面息：今晨閣議中，共當閣員意欲向賴瑪迪總理辭職，經勸吿後，始允俟法總統歐禮和明日自法屬西非返巴黎後再取肯定行動。官方宣布：內閣緊急會議，定明晚由總統親自主持召開。聞共黨領袖陶萊士所述共黨閣員辭職之理由，僅爲「共產黨已變更其物價及工資政策」寥寥數語。賴瑪迪總理仍堅持內閣之正式政策，即維持物價安定水準並不許普遍增加工資。</p>
<h3>報告莫斯科會議經過　馬歇爾演辭全文（續）</h3>
<p>德國賠償問題美蘇意見懸殊</p>
<p>賠償問題…此一問題極具重要性，因爲其他問題幾乎都將受其影響。若千身受德軍佔領和家園市鎭備受德軍蹂躪的盟國人民，對於此一問題均極重視。</p>
<p>一九一九年凡爾賽和約以現款作賠償基礎的經騐，以及雅爾達會議後賠償委員會討論實物賠償的現款價値時所遭遇的困難，使杜魯門總統和他的顧問們在波茨坦會議上相信：若要避免中止摩擦和敵意的話，必須對賠償的決定採擇他方面的基礎。他們商議的結果，同意一項賠償的原則，就是從資本性資產中支付賠償也就是把德國工廠，機器等移到有關的盟國。</p>
<p>但是在莫斯科會議上，蘇聯官員完全不同意杜魯門總統與貝爾納斯先生對此項協議文字條文上的瞭解。關於這一點，英國的意見大半跟美國相同。</p>
<p>我們相信：波茨坦協定的原意並不包含從現行生產獲取賠償的意思在內。蘇聯極力反對這個看法。他們認爲前此雅爾達會議協定上曾經准許蘇聯從現行生產中取得數十億元的賠償。這將使德境內一部份經常生產的工廠，不斷支付賠償，其結果也就是使德國恢復自供自足經濟的時期，爲之延長。美國政府曾經計劃三年內振興德國經濟，結束美國對佔領區居民的經濟援助。這樣一來，美國政府的計劃和希望便全成泡影了。</p>
<p>這是一個極端複雜的問題。四强曾經表明願見德國成一經濟整體的願望。我們必須在這一點上成立協議。</p>
<p>但是盟國之間也有過籠統的協議，如重新審查列入賠償項下可從德國搬移的工廠和設備等。他們明白：德國工業組織過度削弱的結果，不但將使德國自供自足的計劃，難以實現，而且將阻撓整個歐洲的經濟復興。有些工廠本已劃歸賠償搬移項下，但目前的需要把它們留在德國。對於這類工廠，美國曾經表明，願意着手研究從現行生產中取得有限賠償的可能性，但有一項該解必須成立；現行生產的支付賠償不得增加執行佔領任務各强國的財政負担，也不得使盟國貸給德國用作避免德國經濟崩潰的借款，因而拖延償還的日期。對於這個建議，蘇聯政府一直沒有反響。（待續）</p>

<h3>谷部長同情工人要求　認指數爲合理制度　今明召集各業勞資代表搜集資料　返京後提供中樞參考決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會部谷部長正綱昨日曾訪晤本市金融界，陳光甫，徐寄廎等，就生活指數解凍事徵求各方意見。今明兩日將分別召集各業資方勞方代表，搜集有關資料。據谷氏於昨晚對本報記者表示：本人對工人之要求改善待遇，深表同情。但主張改善工人生活時，應同時注意到整個經濟局勢。以生活指數給薪爲合理之制度，去年一年內上海生產界之安定，應歸功於生活指數之採用。目前工商業之不景氣因素甚多，例如機器之陳舊，管理之不當，利息之過高等，不能諉過於高工資。事實上以上海今日之物價而言，工資不能謂過高。今日之眞正問題爲如何提高工人之生產效能。本人在京時，已注意工人生活狀况之材料，抵滬後更多方搜集，詳加硏討，回京後將提出建議，以供中樞參考決定。差額津貼之前施，組工便宜而技工吃虧。本人頃晤銀行界人士，對於指數之是否應予解凍一點，意見殊不一致。本人認爲工人生活必需安定，如此方能謀生產之增加，並盼望以穩定物價之方法，求穩定工資，否則工資雖有增加，工人亦無實惠可言。在另一方面，工人亦應瞭解公敎人員及前方將士之待遇，較之彼等更苦，能採取忍耐之態度，一俟國家經濟安定及進步後，工人之生活必有極大之改善。（上圖爲谷部長，本部攝）</p>

<p>據徐阿巧稱：廿四歲，常熟人，至沈家僅月餘，專司收拾房間等工作。徐並否認主人吸食雅片庭上轉訊丁寳恕，據供：山東人，四十七歲，因周淑貞閙家務糾紛，搬往沈家居住，聞有不適，乃往探望。與沈俊如係在戰前友人家中相識，並不十分友好。於五六年前曾吸食雅片，現早已戒絕。警局來抄査時，係在客堂中。庭上繼追詢，據驚局報吿中稱曾在汝皮包中抄得雅片，汝旣不吸食，要此毒物何用。了吶吶答稱：「我皮包中從未藏雅片，不知怎樣一回事」。</p>
<p>手帕掩面躱避攝影</p>
<p>其時攝影記者拉出照相機，對準鏡頭，擬爲四被吿留影。丁·周等因站立於被吿欄中，無法逃避，急出手帕遮面，不勝羞澀。獨「人妖」沈俊如坦然無懼色。</p>
<p>邵推事繼詢吳范硯恒，據供。前因患有腰子病及血壓過高等病症，曾吸雅片，現已不吸。並不每日至沈家，沈俊如等是否吸雅片，亦不知。范衣藍色綢旗袍，外罩黑大衣，病容憔悴。受審時常以右手撫模頭部。再訊周淑貞，據供：南京人，四十八歲，前在渝時因氣管炎曾吸雅片，來滬後早已不吸。庭上取出烟燈烟槍等物，周稱：此項烟具全係我所有，以前使用，現早擱置。並指烟燈稱：此乃「防空燈」，煮水用。因閙家務出走，暫居沈俊如處。丁·范皆係朋友前來探望我者。邵推事嗣即開始審問「人妖」。沈俊如已改換女裝，衣藍士林布旗袍，黑大衣，身材瘦而碩長，髮左右分開，作男式，供稱：十年前因患血壓過高症試吸雅片，早已斷癮。與周淑貞係朋友，彼離家後即來我處居住。伊麗沙白公寓之房屋頂下不過二月，前居住沙發花園七十三號吳范硯恒家中。誣我吸雅片實寃枉。</p>
<p>吳范硯恒當庭昏倒</p>
<p>邵推事諭稱：據法送鑑定，爾四人均有輕微烟毒徵象，所抄獲之丸藥及藥水中亦均有雅片成份，足證吸食雅片係事實。並宣吿開始辯論。其時吳范硯恒突自被告欄內跌出昏倒在地。邵推事令法警扶住，並立召法醫到庭，爲之診治。因見脈跳尙正常，乃賜坐續訊。旁聽席上被吿家屬頗多，吳范硯恒昏倒後，旁聽席上騷亂一陣，范之家屬並招來一醫師，擬爲范注射嗎啡針止痛，當被邵推事斥退。被吿辯護律師六人，均以被吿等雖持有烟具，及法醫檢得輕微之烟毒徵象，仍不足確定被吿等吸食雅片罪娥，請求重騐，並申請交保。均未爲庭上允准。</p>

<h3>英大遷校運動　學生代表向朱敎長請願　全體敎援已作正面支持</h3>
<p>〔本報金華專訊〕英士大學，頃因校址問題，陷入阢隉不安之氣氛中。連日校內遍貼標語，隨處集會，上下一致要求遷離金華，事實醞釀經過如下：</p>
<p>緣該校成立於戰時，輾轉流徙於浙南雲和小順，泰順里光一帶，數年來設備無由，規模難具，前陳立夫氏主敎育部時，曾由行政院議決通過該校戰後當遷設於上海吳興兩地，一以符紀念英士先生殉國之旨，二亦爲補該校先天之不足。故勝利甫及兩月，該校即率先遷往溫州，整裝得命復員，嗣敎部爲調整全國敎育綱計，忽將英大校址改定浙東之金華，去年校內多故，情勢未經穩定，即匆匆遷金，不圖抵達後，但見滿城頽瓦殘垣，校舍無一着落，後雖經校方不惜巨資，將金華所有破廟，祠堂，寺院，監獄，一併徵用修理，勉供使用，無如地窄人多，諸感下便，且金華經浙東諸役，破壞後地方文化已普遍遭受摧殘，舉凡書店，運動塲，以迄娛樂塲所，均簡陋可憐。全校員生，除平日上課閱覽所，校外舉目無惡所游，舉足無所往，是乃於三月前，由全校師生聯合舉行遷校問題民意總測騐，結果主張遷者達百分之九十七。楊校長公達當面答應，允赴京與敎部商量，於本年二月底首途，迄今兩閱月，非但一事無成，且連楊校長本人亦因氣喘病發，辭職照准。全校師生聞訊，不勝惶悚，遂於上月（四月）廿五日，由文理·法·農·工四院學生自治會聯合成立「遷校運動委員會」，並由全體敎授作正面支持，致電敎部，要求鑒諒英大目前處境，遷離金華。詎値此期間，代理校長周尙，又復以「不勝繁劇」爲由，遽卸代理職務、遂使學校陷入羣龍無首狀態，乃致造成師生間惶恐心理。連日到處召集開會，商討善後，正常課業因此亦遭受影響。學生方面咸盼校址及校長二項問題，得以早日同時解決，以免事態擴大。</p>
<p>聞該校各院學生代表八人，已於上月（四月）廿八日星夜乘車赴杭，此行專爲晋謁敎部朱部長，面懇解決校址校長問題云。</p>
<h3>大夏籌備校慶</h3>
<p>孫哲生董事長將返校主持</p>
<p>本年六月一日，爲大夏大學立校二十三週年校慶紀念日。該校當局已推定吳浩然，邵家麟，蘇希軾，陶愚川，韓鍾琦，宋成志，王元鑫等爲校慶籌備委員。聞已決定盛大慶祝兩天，程序排定如下：第一天（六月一日），上午舉行紀念儀式，男女生宿舍開放及清潔比賽，各處館室及理工學院開或展覽。中午敎職員及校友聚餐聯誼會，下午田徑賽，晚上遊藝公演話劇。六月二日，上午各秈球類決賽，下午夏雨亭破土典禮，校友俱樂部聯誼會，並繼續遊藝，屆時該校董事長孫哲生先生問將返校主持，而京杭一帶校友，已相約返校參加此次復員後首屆校慶。</p>
<h3>參政會將討論　國定課本存廢問題　七聯處慮存書失效</h3>
<p>國定本敎科書前途，日趨黯澹。最近中小學新課程標準，已由敎部分科修訂就緒，約暑前正式公布。此項依照舊標準編制之國定本，不久將失時效。並悉：國民參政會，已定五月二十日舉行大會，屆時國定本之存廢，將爲激烈之辯論課題。一般敎育界人士預測：敎部應順民主政治之輿情，不得不放棄其維持國定制之成見。開放版權之法令，或將因此有所變更，而代以採取審定課本辦法。在此行政法規變更之際，出版業輒踟躊却步。聞七聯處，亦以存書失效爲慮，此次春銷，因印刷遲緩關係，存書特多，曾呈請敎部依照前次協約條款及朱部長諾言，收購全部存書，藉减虧蝕。此事如無完滿結果，除訴諸法律及輿論以外，七聯處方而擬將散布全國各地之存書，提前廉價標售，以免臨時損失過鉅云。</p>

<h3>青白鐵路合組聯軍　今日戰星島　天如不雨五時開賽</h3>
<p>香港星島足球隊來滬觀摩球藝，在滬業已先後二戰，首仗以零比零逼和朝鮮漢城隊，日前對抗猶太之役，以八比一大勝獲勝利。第三戰相逢靑白，原定昨日舉行。惟因故經足球委員曾改於今日下午五時在逸園球塲舉行，惟昨日淫雨終日，今日能否成賽，須於今晨十一時前方能決定，球迷可於中午十二時收聽上海廣播電台之報吿。</p>
<p>設若今日可能舉行，則於一時開始售票，逸園大門同時開放，門票仍售五千及八千兩種，比賽於五時舉行。</p>
<p>靑白隊因球員受傷者頗多，屆時難以整隊，經商得體育會之同意，決以靑鐵聯軍出馬，星島之陣容，及靑鐵聯軍名單，昨日業已公佈，茲先錄於後：</p>
<p>靑鐵聯張渠</p>
<p>岳仁孝　嚴士鑫　吳祺祥</p>
<p>薛沛然　翟水福　高保正　張林根</p>
<p>李壵　羅壽福　蕭子文　李義臣　顧以撒　陸慶祥　費春華</p>

<p>曹秋亭　黎兆榮　張金海　鄒文治　何應芬</p>
<p>（生力軍）朱永强　譚江柏</p>
<p>聯軍自經由靑白與鐵路合組而成後配備頗見整齊，惟孟義良因於日前小球賽中，不愼傷足後，今日難以出塲，故改由高保正出任中堅巨艱，門將田張渠担任，加以吳嚴鐵閘一雙，堪稱全滬最理想者，張林根與阿福分任前衛，保正之中堅，去年死訂黎兆榮獲一致好評，今日重逢，必有更優異之演出。</p>
<p>星島隊長許竟成因上次對猶太之役中足踝受傷後，致今日陣容稍有更動，然實力仍甚堅强，一日與靑白遭遇，預料必多精彩鏡頭。</p>

<h3>政府繼續拋售食米　限憑戶籍證購買</h3>
<p>吳市長召米商談話抑平糧價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長出席全國物價會議後，自京歸來，昨晨接見記者談稱：政府已決定續向國外訂購洋米十四萬噸，以充實米源。本市與無錫產區米價之差額，物價會議亦已規定爲百分之二十。江蘇省政府於一日在鎭江召集各縣縣長舉行會議，商討抑平產區米價。此舉對於本市影響甚大。</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時，吳市長在市府召集米商代表徐頌仁，査寳三，顧益生，胡文安，翟振華，張錫潮，胡咸鋼等談話。社會局吳局長亦出席。各米商代表歷陳蘇錫產區近日米價上漲情形，本市糧商因採購困難，致影響本市糧源甚鉅。雖市府每日拋售食米九千包，合一萬一千餘石之多，而市上米號頗多無貨應市者。究其原因，不外一般市民之爭相購儲，及黄牛黨之搶購牟利。當經吳市長吳局長決定自今日起，凡本市市民向米號購買政府拋售之食米，暫定限制辦法爲：</p>
<p>携證購米規定辦法</p>
<p>（一）各區市民携同戶籍證本區內米號購來，由米號在戶籍證背而加蓋日期印戳，並備册詳錄購米市民之區保甲及姓名，以備査核。</p>
<p>（二）每人每次以一斗爲限。每戶每次以五斗爲最高額。每隔半個月可憑戶籍證購米一次。</p>
<p>（三）白米門售價格每斗一萬六千八百元，紅秈米每斗一萬三千二百元，西貢米每斗一萬二千五百元，暹邏米每斗一萬六千八百元</p>
<p>白粳門售限廿萬元</p>
<p>各米商代表復聲述販運困難情形，請求體恤商艱，寬放由商人販運來滬之米價。經市長面諭商人自行販售之米，暫限最高白粳門售每石不得超過二十萬元。政府拋售米糧，必須依照上開辦法及限價出售，不得攙雜變質。</p>
<p>黑市白粳達廿四萬</p>
<p>米價受產地影響，繼續在漲不已。白粳黑市達二十四萬，白元越二十六萬。南市塲到貨絕跡，北市塲亦僅到七百廿六石半。交易不能做開，市塲行情單遂成白紙一張，社會局仍拋白米及暹邏秈共九千包。</p>
<p>國外洋米到七萬噸</p>
<p>據中央信託局消息：本局經向國外訂購之洋米，係根據國際糧食緊急處理委員會之配額而進行者，原爲廿四萬噸，內三萬噸移撥別用，共計廿一萬噸，係分向暹邏越南等處訂購者。本年一月至四月，已運到七萬噸，尙有十四萬噸待運，決於本年六月底前，全部運入。本月內可運到七萬噸，有暹邏米三萬噸，本年六七八三個月內之食米，決無問題。</p>
<p>抬價米店拘禁三天</p>
<p>近來米價屢見暴漲，爲米蠶作祟所致，故有關當局除儘量疏通來源，加緊拋售食米外，對不法米蠢，決予嚴厲制裁。一星期來，迭經査獲抬價或囤積之不法米店多起。茲悉本市邑廟警察分局昨據市民密報，南市露香園路一一六號，同鑫米店擅自抬高米價，以每石十九萬元高價出售。另又有同路七十七號泰豐米號，更以每升二千元之零售價格，向升合貧民肆意剝削，以圖非法私利。當經該分局派警前往調査屬實，即將該二米店主扣押，予拘留三天以儆。存米由分局派員監視，依照限價出售。</p>

<h3>棉布轉口問題　不久將有開展</h3>
<p>自行政院公佈平抑紗布市價均衡供應辦法，本市紗布已停止轉口。染織及棉布二業曾一再具呈紡管會，請求兼顧生產機能及商運艱困。昨晨（一日）除電請張院長令知紡管會採納同業意見，統籌妥善辦法外，復由該二公會負責人晋見吳市長，請以紡管會兼主任委員之地位，顧全本市正當工商業之生機。下午四時，吳市長復邀潘士浩前往商談，對於市面眞相，轉口情形，多所詢問。並表示當於奉行中央政令之範圍內，儘量容納同業公會之意見。關於限額分配及減少，限止種類二點，允予考慮。潘氏又出與紡管會業務處懇談，聞今明二日內可能有一會議，共同討論。近日染織棉布二業同業二千餘家，正在焦慮此一問題之嚴重。但據潘氏表示，吳市長必有妥善之處置。目下之停頓狀態，不久可望入於正軌云。</p>
<h3>統一輸入管理辦法　取消華南臨時措施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執委會，於四月廿九日舉行第三十次例會，粤區辦事處麥處長佐衡來滬出席，據報吿該區簽發輸入許可證之現狀如次：</p>
<p>（甲）在廣州區辦事處所簽發之臨時許可證，概由指定銀行售結外匯，在九龍分辦事處及拱北關所簽發之臨時許可證，均不結匯。</p>
<p>（乙）已登記合格進口商，附表（二）者三百四十二家，附表（三）甲者，五百五十一家。</p>
<p>（丙）糧食及肥料，每次得申請港幣六千元，建築材料及紙張，每次得申請港幣四千元，附表（三）甲之貨品，每家每日申請以港幣二千元爲限，附表（二）之貨品，每家每星期之申請，不</p>
<p>得超越港幣一萬二千元。</p>
<p>（丁）九龍簽發許可證，其進口地點爲廣州梧州江門湛江北海汕頭厦門福州等地，拱北關所簽發許可證，祗限於拱北關一地之用。</p>
<p>上述情形，係華南實施之臨時辦法，良以港粤一水之隔，情形特殊，當政府公佈修正貿易辦法時，爲免使貿易完全停頓，採取上開之暫時措施，現經執行委員會再三討論，認爲華南區亦應按照全國性辦法辦理，以資劃一，正由麥處長與限額分配處及非限額審核處分別洽商切實辦法，一俟佈置就緒，前述之臨時辦法，當即取消云。</p>
<h3>疋頭椗紗南運廣州</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海粤輸昨日南駛，裝有大批紗布，計疋頭三千一百二十件，棉衫八百二十件，運往廣州。聞　後紗布出口，須事先得棉織品管理委員會許可，始可報關裝運。</p>
<h3>棉布市價續升</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因客地價格自紗布限制出口後，到源漸少，價與滬市懸殊，故客帮均有套買。市塲喊價繼續上升，十二磅龍頭細布由二十七萬三四千元步高至二十八萬三千元，較上日軋升一萬三千元，五福細布亦做高至二十七萬五千元，升一萬七千元，其餘各牌均上升自五六千元至一萬餘元。四君子元嗶嘰金印由二十五萬元升至二十五萬五千元。北路棉布比滬市高出四萬餘元，故北帮進胃甚健。紡建公司照例開售布疋，二十支特細布價提高至二十萬零三千元，無牌彩球細布爲二十一萬八千元，限於廠家請購。</p>
<h3>受高物價刺激　白報紙上漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕白報紙行市，昨因各物報漲陣脚亦轉堅硬。計維昌洋行白報紙每令十七萬五千元，漲五千元。加拿大白報紙十七萬一千元，漲六千元。蘇聯王子報紙十六萬八千元，漲八千元，對開報紙十六萬五千至八千元。據悉：最高檔白報紙，曾於上月廿四五日時，一度漲達十九萬元。惟多係喊價，成交殊稀，故廿六日起，又逐步回疲。業中人談：報紙究與紗布不同，行市疲呆時，拋售不易。此番逐步高漲，國內產量少，國外供應少，固屬根本原因，惟近因實係受一般物價騰漲所刺激云。</p>
<h3>茶市仍無起色</h3>
<p>虛頹已久之洋莊茶市，昨日市上，仍感挽回乏術。揆其原因，買戶賡續袖手旁觀，人心難以奮起。各種內銷茶，則本街及近鄕依然有人顧問，市勢尙不寂寞。惟同業互做價，則以進出相若，遂鮮軒輊。存底涸枯之三十五年度白琳紅茶，自營口帮胃納突旺後，目前即將吿罄，因此彼地雖仍有需求，而交易則吿停頓也。</p>

<h3>防癆的重要性</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>在現在的醫學上，還有三種大病症，沒有根本的治療方法，可以解決：（一）麻瘋，（二）癌，（三）就是癆病。所以這三種病症，大家都公認爲人類健康人類生命的大敵。就中尤以癆病一症，其爲害更爲普遍，更爲深入！因爲該症傳染的機會特多，而治療上，非但沒有根本的辦法，醫生見了，搖頭縐眉，而且對於治療本症這一件事，在在個人的職業，經濟，發生密切的關係，本症患者，因爲職業上的牽制和經濟上壓迫，而坐失治療時機的，不知凡幾。</p>
<p>因爲治療癆病的諸種困難，於是引起各人對於「預防」這件事的注意和重視了。本來，「預防」在近代醫學上的價値，爲世所公認，而對於癆病一症，尤爲顯著。癆病的爲害人類，訛都曉得，然亦未始不可以人力的預防工作，而减少其爲害的程度和範圍。我們看　歐美各國中，癆病以及類乎癆病的各種傳染病，已逐漸地在那裘减少！這便是因爲他們科學的進步，衛生事業發達，預防工作努力的效果。又回頭看看我們中國，一切的疾病—尤以癆病一類的傳染病，幾有日益蔓延，到處猖獗之勢；原因固然很複雜，然其主要原因，當不外乎因科學的落伍，衛生事業的幼稚，預防工作的不重視，不努力，有以致之罷。唉，看看人家，看看自己，眞覺得慚愧，更覺得痛心！</p>
<p>旣知「預防」的效力，關係於癆病的消長，有這樣的重要，那末，我人對於這項切重的防癆工作，是應如何的加以注意，加以重視了。</p>
<p>防癆的重要，旣如上述，那末，他的工作意義在那裏？他的工作意義，要不外乎這麽兩種：</p>
<p>（一）對於未患的健者，設法如何預防，以免傳染成疾。</p>
<p>（二）對於已患的病人，則設法使他們不因輕症轉重，重症變危；同時，更如何設法使他們不至於傳染於無病的好人。</p>
<p>如何才能使這項切重的防癆工作發生出效力來呢？第一便是「宣傳工作」。所謂宣傳，便是喚醒一般民衆，對於癆病這一個病症的注意和認識；使他們明陳癆病的危險，使他們了解「防癆」這項工作的重要。</p>
<p>癆病在中國，是十分的　遍，到處蔓延，這是無可諱言的事實，其所以弄得這樣普遍，所以任其這樣蔓延的原因，是由於人民的不講求衛生，也是週知的事。然要追問到爲何人民不講求衛生，換句話說，其所以不講求衛生的原因，又在那裏呢？這就不能不說，是由於人民缺乏知識—尤其缺乏衛生知識的緣故！因爲衛生知識的缺乏，所以就不能明白，講求衛生是能增進健康，避免疾病，延長壽命；不衛生是要妨害健康，招引疾病，縮短壽命。因爲衛生知識的缺乏，所以便不曉得隨痰涕裏頭，往往藏着許多足以殺人的癆菌。用刀殺人，他們是曉得躲避，痰能殺人，他們便想不到，不曉得。根本原因，還不是因爲他們不曉得刀能殺人，痰亦能殺人道一個知識嗎？</p>
<p>所以我說：要使這項防癆工作發生效力，第一步的工作，便是宣傳。無論直接的演講宣傳，口頭宣傳，間接的文字宣傳。都能發揮出訪癆的宣傳效能，收獲到防癆的工作效果的。我們應當想出各種方法，把癆病這個病症的種種知識，或用動聽的語言，或用通俗生動的文字，普遍的向大衆去宣傳，使他們明瞭癆病的危害，知這防癆的切重。比方他們能徹底曉得了痰能傳染癆病，生了癆病是如何的繁難治愈，如何的危害生命，他們便會逐漸地改變這種隨地吐痰的惡習慣。他們曉得癆病的如何傳染，才會在未病的平時，注意到預防的實施，知道得了癆病的患者，對於治愈繁難，尤其晚期治療的無望，才會注意到及早就醫的早期治療。這便是防癆作的最高目標。防癆工作果能做到了這一步田地，也便是「防癆」的大成功！</p>
<h3>BCG中文命名之商槯</h3>
<p>— 劉永純</p>
<p>BCG在公元一九二一年第一次在法國作人類接種，七年後（民圖十七年），南京國民政府衛生建設委員會，即提議製造此苗以防癆病。此後雖間有醫界名流，如宋國賓先生之輩，繼起響應，但迄未經國人之注意。茲因各國學者試騐，結果優良，中國醫界對於BCG亦多贊美；而衛生當局復擬大量推行，是誠防癆之福音，殊可慶幸！筆者以爲此苗旣將普遍使用，其中文命名，實有規定之必要。譯名之事本極困難；可以譯音，可以譯義，亦可音義兼譯。鄙意如逕稱BCG爲「預防結核菌苗」，未免太嫌廣泛，或可音義兼譯以「必洗療」三字名之；惟其弊在於頗似成藥之名，是否有當？還請同道進而敎之。</p>
<h3>新中醫之謎　（完）</h3>
<p>— 洪貫之</p>
<p>譬如神經反射的現象，血球凝集的反應，都是「物質」的表現，如果我們在沒有明白一切「反射」和「凝集」的原理之先，自然就會認這種現象是玄妙的生機，是超物質的，於是連細菌的作用，也把他看做超物質的，而歸之於六淫，結果成爲載鬼一車的瞎說，直到如今，還要抱着死去的骸骨，自鳴得意，眞是可嘆！再看他文中還引了一段日人小酒井的話說：「醫學上的定律，誰也不能保證他是絕對的正確，牛頓力學的定律，尙且由愛因斯坦的相對性原理而修正，醫學上的定律，也不能例外，都有充分的加一番攷察的必要，」接着牟君就大發高論說：「今日的一切定理信條，旣未容全信，我們唯一可以依據的，就是經騐的事實，所以今日之中醫，不應將寳貴的事實，盲目地同聲附和西醫，便算了事，要知道西醫的學理，天天進步在修正中，難道我們也天天跟着附和，做一輩子落伍的舊醫嗎？」哈哈！我看牟君的說法，實在頑固得有點驚人，原來牟君是要中醫老是停留在一個地方，不要牠進步的，或是說「天天進步在修正中」的學問，是不値得我們效法的，所以要別開生面，另求出路，只好求到死人的經騐中去，這種出路，確是一條好的去處，可以得到很好的歸宿。（老實說就是死路）中醫的治療紀錄，不配稱爲「經騐的」，我在上文早已說過，而且在中醫的文獻中，憑你通天本領，要想掘出可貴的寳藏來，是萬不可能的，這種工作，也不知有多少人去嘗試過，結果一無所得。從前說：「鑒七日而混沌依然，」只是柱費勞心，掘來掘去，只能掘出一大堆的骷髏，（茅盾和不可靠的成績）除此以外，空無所有了。牟君說葉橘泉君「近世國藥處方集」等，這種溝通方法不好，固然這種方法也並不是妥善的辦法，對於中西醫的統一，也無甚功績可言，不過他的思想，總是正確的，是想把中西醫統一起來的，是要將中醫納於科學之軌，不是要中西醫分立對峙的，所以不管他結果如何，他們的出發點，總還是對的；不像牟君，却存了一個野心，要想設法把「中醫」永久獨立，長存不滅，而借屍還魂的加上一件「科學化」的寳衣，裝璜裝璜就完了！另外牟君又舉出許多「吸收外來文化，融洽消化，自成體系」的例子，以示中國文化有「宏深消納」的能力，抑知外來文化的交流，與融洽，也只限於某一部份，其思想性質必須相近而在同一時代，才有可能，若要想把「空想」的一玄說」，來與「實騐」的「科學」來雜交而產生優良的新種，那是不可　　能的事，也同我們凡夫俗子，要夢想配一個九天玄女一樣的滑稽；以這樣一個不通的人，也來談什麼「科學」，什麽「史的過程」，能不令人齒冷？我眞想不到，在從前中醫界中主張匯通中西的人從來不敢做不敢說的；現在竟有這個怪人，發此妄念，來玩這套把戲，不知中醫界的先進，或後輩，對之作何感想？所謂「一方面千萬把握住自己固有的學理，一方面要吸收融化外來的科學知識」，「我們反對被動的盲從的西醫化，我們應該自動的起來，吸收外來的科學知識」，這個話，我眞不懂，牟君不要「西醫化」，郤要吸收融化外來的「科學知識」，究竟是怎麽一回事？旣然不承認天天在進步中的西醫知識，而要反對牠，不知另外還有什麼是眞正外來的「科學知識」，你可曉得一切「外來的科學知識」，也都是「天天在進步進修正中的」嗎？依我看來，還是請你不吸收爲妙，否則你免不了總要「做一輩子的落伍的舊醫」了！魔障千重，孽海無邊，回頭是岸，猛省猛省。</p>
<p>牟君文中還有最妙的一段，大的也是他得意之筆，他說：「因爲人體的一切組織，悉有血管及神經互相聯絡，絕無眞正局部的疾病，凡是局部的病變，無不影饗全身」，這種强調主觀的說法，我恐怕不但科學家要笑你不懂事，就是中醫見了，——不只是中醫，即使鄉下婦孺聽了，也曾說你不懂醫學而笑落牙齒的。所謂「絕無眞正局部的疾病」，這種話眞不知你如何大胆說得出來，中醫書中，也從來找不出一條「經文」，有什麽病都屬於全身的話，肺　，腸　，中醫也只呌他肺　，腸　，沒有把他混稱「五臟六腑　」，也沒有把他擴大了病的部位，而直稱之爲「人　」，因爲這個都是局部病變，不能過甚其詞的；此外比較抽象的病證，雖然沒有西醫的分析精密，也均是實指其處，頭疼就呌頭疼，肋痛腰痛也就呌肋痛腰痛並不呌他全身痛，以與眞的全身痛相區別，然而牟君總是喜歡强詞奪理，是非黑白，一至於此，豈不痛心！如此「中醫」，如此「科學」，此之謂現代的「東方文化」？嗚呼　予欲無言。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>現在的中醫陣營，眞可說是混亂極了，比較聰明一點的，都在偷偷地使用西藥，僞稱秘方，實際上已逐漸變質，說得不好聽點，就是剽竊新法，然而事無可諱，也就等於投降，另外有一部人，祇拿聽診器，體溫計等，來裝璜鬥面的，却完全是變相廣吿作用，又當別論。近年我們在社會上特別是內地，還可看到的，就是有少數無照西醫，因爲衛生機關變通給蹬，早經停辦，而甄別考詢問題，至今沒有得到合理的解決，就中也就有人投入了中醫的陣營，以便取得合法地位之後，去執行他的西醫業務，事實上他們並不十分了解中醫，有時也居然站起來讚美中醫，豈不可笑，亦復可憐。然而「正統」派的中醫，根深蒂固，依然存在，還擁有多數人的信仰，你想一種專門性的自由職業，竟會攪到這種地步，居然口裏還高唱着什麽「保存中醫，」簡直有類夢囈。我們曉得改進中醫，決不是剽竊新法，和應用西藥的說法，必須從學術基礎上着手，所有崇古薄今的思想，更非根本肅淸不可，否則就算表面上能接受科學的業績，仍是自欺欺人的行徑。近來有一部份自命爲新中醫的，以爲如此，便是中醫科學化了，這使醉心科學，而對於醫藥沒有相當認識的人，有時也會上他們的當，其實也與我上文所說，能在文童上寫幾個新醫術語一樣的淺薄，說來說去，總是不够條件的，因爲他們對於新醫學的基礎學理，根本沒有接受啊！</p>
<p>西醫學是「科學的」產物，除此以外，當然不能另外有一個「科學醫學，」所謂科學醫學，就是西醫學，這是再也明白不過的；但是我們所說的「中醫科學化，」是指職業中醫的「人，」而不是指「中醫理論，」也不是指中醫「文獻；」中醫文獻，是應該用史學方法整理，和科學方法硏究的，至於整理研究的方法，當另爲專文討論，中醫理諭是「玄說，」是無法科學化的。我們的希望；就是希望中醫們也學學西醫學，因爲西醫學也是醫學，這是一般中醫所不否認的，而且中醫科學化，也是大多數中醫界的開明份子所熟烈提倡的，這裏所要說的，爲避免文字冗長起見，所以也只限於「科學化」的方法，換句話說：也就是今後「新中醫的」出路。我想要使一個人具備雙重學問，總是一件好事，大概總不致於會反對吧？說得痛快一點，今後中醫科學化的途徑，實在只有漸漸步上全部西醫化，而用中藥之一途，所有科學醫的一切基礎臨床知識，都應該全盤接受，必須這樣，才能稱爲眞正的科學化，才有新的出路。至於中醫舊有經騐的一部份，如果有價値的，照樣也可以保存而發揚之，因爲獎重學識，備於一人，那麽融會貫通，也就並非難事。只要新中醫有全盤接受科學醫學的勇氣和決心，將來的前途，自然是光明的，這種只問醫學，不問中西的態度，是最有必要的，千萬不要再存了夜郎自大的心理，抱殘守缺，不求前進；或者還想把中醫永久獨立起來，長存於世界，這種違反歷史進化公例的思想，只有自取滅亡而已。說得痛快一點，不但在中醫理論中，決沒有什麽寳藏可掘，而且中醫要想改進，除了全部科學化以外，已是絕無他途，任何改進的方法，前人都已做過，無諭如何，都失敗了，這是不可否認的事。前車覆轍，千萬不可再去上當，請大家靜坐深思，不必多生妄念了！謂余不信，不妨靜觀後果！</p>
<p>最後，我還得重復一遍，就是已經服膺科學，願意轉身別求出路的中　，目前確實也有不少，總得給他們一個轉身的機會，指示一條正確的出路，纔不致理沒他們的苦心，也是很要緊的。從來講醫學革命的人，總是批評中醫的不行，等到有的中醫已經覺悟的時候，要想別求「出路，」結果又是無門可入；若干衛生機關有時還要禁鋼他們，不許他們接近科學落離，這也未免令人失望。所以設立中醫科學訓練機關，無論如何，是有十分必要的，希望今後衛生當局和西醫界的人，開開善門，加意扶植啊！（一九四七，三，一，於上海）</p>
<h3>瘋犬病淺說</h3>
<p>— 陳金斗</p>
<p>三月廿八日「華美晚報」上有中醫界編輯的醫刋，其中載着一篇「對於瘋犬病之商榷」的文字文中有一殘是中醫自供過錯的叙述：「蓋瘋犬病醫者，根本可說大都是捕風捉影，毫無切確依據把握，惟以扳方秘藥，來强作蠻幹，不顧死活地，以風燥攻下破血諸峻品大藥，硬使攻伐……斬傷人之元氣，…若體虛無毒的人，則必反轉生他病。每個服進此等方藥的人，無論有毒無毒必見小便下血絲，腹痛如刀割，大便痢黑，拿人命作兒戲，拿人臟腑作戰塲基地。」又說：「毒亦是一種氣化，根本是不希罕不大可怕的事。」筆者學識尙淺，對於傳染病亦無專門硏究，但拜讀此文之後，不勝惶恐，用敢將關於　犬病的常識，作一次公開的通俗的介紹。</p>
<p>瘋犬病本來發生於狗，狼，狐，貓，牛，馬，豬，羊等獸類；所謂瘋犬病這個名詞，根據其希臘原文Lyssa的意義，是表示狂燥痙瘋的情形，所以由病象面得名。人若罹此病，最大多數是直接由於被已經得病的瘋犬咬嚙，或舐吻裸露的傷口，於是在牠唾液中的病毒，得經傷口之接觸而傳入人體。這種病毒，目前也稱之爲濾過性毒（FiltrierbarcsVirus），病毒由傷口進入之後，沿着當地的神經，逕達腦脊髓系；換句話說，以末梢神經爲通路，而引入到中樑神經，然後，腦部等神經節細胞的構造被破壞，機能起變異，就發出各種症象，因爲病獸中以犬爲最常見，接觸機會也較多，所以一般就稱此病爲瘋犬病（也呌狂犬病）。</p>
<p>無論人或獸，旣經罹受本病，一定要發生神經錯亂，肉肌痙攣等症狀，每逢見到水的時候，或甚至要想飲水之際，咽頭和呼吸道的肌肉，即起急劇痙攣，因而呼吸困難，窒息而致命的；所以本病患者，對於水液就發生很大的恐懼，於是恐水病（Hydrophobia）的名稱，也算是本病的推號了。（待續）</p>

<h3>成都散步</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>竹琴雜藝</p>
<p>賈瞎子的「竹琴」，據說是成都的一種有名的玩藝，有兩次，我被朋友拉着，去欣賞這種藝術。「竹琴」的名辭，在我聽起來很新鮮，但究免不知道「竹琴」是一種什麽樂器。後來纔知道，這是從前唱「道情用的「魚鼓」和「竹板」，正是畫裏面的八仙之一的「張果老」手裏拿的玩意。成都人稱之爲竹琴。</p>
<p>一個茶園的一處小閣樓上，闢出了小小的茶室，可以容幾十副小茶座，中間一座小臺，像學校裏的小講臺似的，講桌上小牌坊似的豎着一塊「賈樹三」的玻璃招牌，是那個塲所的景象。到這裏來的大都是愛聽竹琴的高雅份子，所以都坐得文質彬彬，沒有什麼吵閙。在茶房一聲高喊之中，買樹三上塲，是一個戴墨晶眼鏡的瞎子，戴一頂禮帽，穿灰色綢袍和黑背心，捧着竹琴，稍坐片時，擦臉喝茶之後，幽幽地手弄竹琴，唱起來了。</p>
<p>這好像是名貴的歌唱，他每次只唱兩個回目，中間有五分鐘的間歇，共費去聽衆一小時的時間。以文辭而論，他的辭句相當的通俗而雅潔，但那柔弱的聲調，使我聯想到從前流行於故鄉的彈詞，用吳音和三弦彈唱出來的辭句，和這種音調正有相同的感覺。在人們的思想和情感上，我覺得成都朋友有和蘇州人相同的處所，吃小吃，坐茶館，說俏皮話，裝虛面子，宜乎讚賞如此柔靡的音樂，這是一種虛浮的文化造成的。歷史上因爲交通不便，宜乎四川人帶有十足的保守性，所以，即使是聰明睿智之才，也只限於幾個舞文弄墨的人，除了司馬相如，蘇東坡，李太白，楊雄和近代的幾例文人，好像並沒有產生過驚天動地的人。這幾個朋友在他　嘗盡流離之苦，而故鄕人對之却有不勝欣羨崇拜之至之感，因此，尙文之風，不亞於兩江，而文物之富，又遠不如吳燕。交通綫旣位於揚子江的上游，其一切的風尙，成爲昔日之「蘇常」的附庸，是當然之事，人到成都來，有走到從前上海的「中國地界一來的感覺，大約也是這個原因。</p>
<p>竹琴之外有所謂「洋琴」的玩意，也在一個茶樓上，是用鼓板，胡琴，配合着幾根銅絲綳在一塊木板上用兩根竹片敲打的創始於廣東的這種樂器的一種合奏，唱的人不止一個，有生旦凈丑幾個人，因爲比較的複雜，聽來比較的有使人精神奮發的傾向，唱小旦的也戴着一副黑眼鏡，唱出貓呌似的聲音，很有點媚人的神氣，其所以戴黑眼鏡，大約也是自己覺得不好意思，這裏的聽衆更多，並且有急急趕來，低聲附和，最後，大鼓其掌的人，我眞羨慕四川朋友，有這麽好的與緻和餘暇。</p>
<p>成都只有一個京戲園，演唱上海風的京戲，演員們與其說是賣藝，無寗說是賣俏。本地戲很多，即是「川戲」。我覺得唱川戲的還按照其傳統，規規矩矩的唱。不十分的「亂來」。「賈培芝」是川戲中演員中的翹楚，他是有名的紅生，我特別去看他的關公。川戲在動作上和中國所有的舊戲完全相同，而唱句則是低沉而柔　，低尖的聲音很多，調子上缺乏變化，是用幾種單音，反覆地廻旋，而最後稍拖長音的唱法。樂器和唱白常常離開，而只在唱句的最後加以配音，用別調補充唱白的間歇，在一度激越的唱句之後，後臺人加以合唱，這在戲劇史上，可以說是一種古老的唱法。</p>
<p>亟相祠堂</p>
<p>被老杜詩「丞相祠堂何處尋，錦官城外柏森森。」描寫過的「武侯祠」，在成都南門外，不到幾里地的地方。大道的右側，一大所院落和兩座殿堂，隱在參天的翠柏之間。這伯樹，被唐人歌詠過，可以想見他的古老，巍峨的殿宇和牆垣，想來經過不知道多少人的修理。一般人稱之謂「武侯祠」，大門口却高懸着「昭烈廟」的匾額。但先帝的殿堂在前，諸葛的殿堂在後，有喧賓奪主的情况，看到前殿和後殿的建築，一則莊嚴繁複，一則樸質簡單的比較，就可以知道後代人對於丞相特別的眷念，至於丞相殿前不得不有先主殿，而門口標之爲昭烈廟，大約是表示「臣不侮君」的意思。丞相旣有建祠的資格，先主也該裝一裝面子，因托孤之重而竟鞠躬盡瘁以死的丞相，報答知遇之恩的一片眞摯之心，因如此的設計而代爲保留了，然而，我總感到諸葛亮受了莫大的寃枉。生前被騙以至死的這位聰明之至的傻瓜，實在是一個悲劇式的人物。諸葛亮實在沒有和曹操作對的必要，至於想重復「漠土」，在家裏　張更大的地圖，上面題些念起來好聽的字就可以，何必不竟在南陽作自耕農，而要給別人作長工呢？</p>
<p>但武侯祠實在是淸幽的地方，我喜歡坐在殿右的水閣上喝茶，看那崔巍的古柏，複摺的殿堂，聽樹顚蒼鷹的怪呌，環顧廟的前部已作學校地方打着籃球的頑童，一些老僧和茶客，覺得這裏也成了亦古亦今的處所。</p>
<p>枇杷門巷</p>
<p>有所謂「枇杷門巷」的薛濤祠，在東門外錦江的岸邊，某大學的附近，那裏面有薛濤井。據說，這井裏的水，曾經被歷史的名妓之一的薛濤浣紙之用，因此，這井以人而得名，而人也就顧井思人了。去遊薛濤井，可以經過一條柳堤，成排的柳樹後面，郊原上，立着整齊的大學的半中半四式的房舍，對對成雙的靑年男女們，在這郊原上，柳堤上散步或讀書，但看來是並肩私語的人多，正經用功的人少。薛濤井已經成爲一個公園，門口擺着小攤，裏面設着茶座，很有些好讀的年輕人，便在這裏啜茗而閱雜誌和報章，蔽天的錄竹、冬夏常靑，洗去了終年從城裏帶去的塵俗。</p>
<p>讀薛濤小傳，看硏上石刻的薛濤像，可以想起薛濤的生平。跟着宦游的父親到這裏，因父歿而流落異鄕的她，爲了要養活母親，不得不出而侍酒，幸而能詩，得到文士們的同情，所以不作小星而成「校書」，其內心之苦，當百倍於今日之交際花，色衰之後，作道裝，屛友客，獨居小樓，而度其暮年，也可以想見她的悲厄的一生，內心的寂寞了。</p>
<p>「望江樓」也在這裏面，但我並沒有想登樓而望江，因爲我曾經過過翻山越嶺，飄洋過海的生活，登菜館式的不高之樓，望河浜似的不寬之江。實在不過癮。四川之美，完全在城市以外的山間，一羣人坐在小公園裏喝茶，漫讀別人的詩文，而妄談世界之變化的這些地方，多少年來已經和我無綠，因爲實在雅得太俗，靜得太閙，和平得太嚕囌，舒服得太無聊了。</p>
<p>青羊宮</p>
<p>「靑羊宮」在南門外，幾乎已經是鄉裏的地方。是市梢的一座道敎的廟宇。這裏，每年春天要舉行一次花會。從四鄕送來各種奇花，在這裏比賽，是一個熱閙的集會。據我想，可以說原來並沒有宗敎的中國，漢唐以後，道敎算是中國人自己創造的一種宗敎。但遠不敵來自異土的佛敎有勢力，因爲，道敎實在沒有一貫的理論，而其說法完全是一種神話，所以只能騙愚夫愚婦。佛敎在般一人想起來，好像也是鼓吹迷信的，但因爲他有不少的經典，無論什麽宗派，主要的在促進個人的修養，而以達到克已愛人爲極致，所以看來好像是消極的態度，但其實適用於任何一方面，能使每一個個人和羣衆調和，不起私意，所以，他雖然受了若干腐儒的毁謗，而得到許多眞知識者的提倡，居東洋宗敎的首位了。我許多年遊跡所至，知道道敎不如佛敎有勢力，尤其在南方，道敎比佛敎更爲式微，這是因爲兩晋南北朝以來，民族南移，佛敎也隨着政治勢力繁殖到長江流域來，所以這靑羊宮，雖然是一座大廟，實在可以說是相當的陳舊了。廟的前部已經作爲軍警機關，保存宗敎和藝術的氣息的，僅是後面的一所大殿，和廢園中的一個八卦亭，因爲過去的建築相當的講究，至今依然保存了他的美觀和威嚴，但靑羊之名，實在不知道有什麼根據。大殿上主要的神像是老君，分列左右的兩隻銅羊，是美麗無比的藝術珍品。銅製的和眞的羊一般大小的模型，被多少年來人們摸得光光的，實在可愛，眞是兩件好古董。爲了這兩隻銅羊，我在那廟裏盤桓了半天，覺得也並不無聊，比坐在菜館裏喝菜好得多了。</p>
<p>大殿的側面，有一個院子，是道士們的宿舍，紙總木壁，古樸到幾於像明朝的時候，我覺得，住在這裏面，讀讀書，寫寫字，到很舒服，然而，這種幸福，已經給此地的道士佔去了。無論到那裏，我總不幸而是城裏了，眞是可恨。</p>
<p>七殺碑</p>
<p>明末流寇張默忠的遺物「七殺碑」，在「草堂寺」上面刻着「天生萬物以養人，人無一德以報天，殺殺殺殺殺殺殺。」流覽淸代筆記小說，有許多記載張默忠的故事；據說，殘酷到將女人的小脚砍下，積成山那麽樣的堆子，可見殺人的多了。我想到歷史上的慘禍，看到現在的局面，實在恐怖極了。</p>
<h3>哭符鐵年</h3>
<p>— 馬公愚</p>
<p>衡陽振奇士，在屯虛白姿，雕譚詮奧旨，適氣顯華詞。論交過廿載，長我肩常隨（君長余五歲）；擊鉢謝蝴蝶，飛亳米虎兒；丹靑復矯矯，苦瓜與天池；三絕人共喩，勁節世罕知：八年惟寂寞，守德誦明夷，如何捲土後，臣朔　苦　；天心未厭禍，一老不憗遺；世亂文字賤，安忍讀遺詩（君曩寄余詩，有「世亂文字賤」句）！故交日零落，我非哭其私。</p>
<h3>英·梅斯斐爾特作：　海熱</h3>
<p>— 眞勤試譯</p>
<p>我必須再去大海，去那寂寞的天空和海　，</p>
<p>我所要求的一切，只不過是一隻大船和一顆星兒在她上面引</p>
<p>還有那輪盤底反衝，風兒底歌唱和那白帆底動搖，</p>
<p>以及海面上灰色的霧幕和灰色的破曉。</p>
<p>我必須再去大海，因爲那動盪的潮水的怒呌，</p>
<p>是一個不能否認的瘋狂而淸晰的喚召；</p>
<p>我所要求的一切，只不過是一個有風的日子，白雲飛飄，</p>
<p>還有那傾覆的浪花和吹動的泡沫以及那海鷗底呼號。</p>
<p>我必須再去大海，度那吉布賽的人生，流浪浮漂，</p>
<p>到海鷗和海鯨底路上去，那里的風如利刀；</p>
<p>我所要求的一切，只不過是一個同遊者笑說着快樂的故事滔滔。</p>
<p>以及長久把舵後的安眠和美夢底來到。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　500</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>此外還得到一個傳奇式的說法，據說當日留滬的韓國同志，因要避却日寇淫虐，有很多靑年女志士，都男裝打扮，一方也可便利工作的意思。也許這位會見鶴見的韓方代表，正是女扮男裝之一？</p>
<p>總之無論這位韓國志士是男是女，筆者無論把人家姓名遺漏，難辭疎忽的罪過，謹以十萬分的誠意和歉忱，向這位同志吿罪，謹祝他或她在天之靈，永遠安寗！此外，並且馨香禱祝這輩韓國志士們，替他們祖國所洒這多熱血，能够化成一塊堅實光榮的基石，替韓國奠定一個永世昌隆的國運！</p>
<p>特二號李明，（上海淪陷時期，掌管流動式秘密情報無綫電，不幸在三十四年七月日寇屈膝的前夕，被敵方特工捉住，壯烈犧牲了—筆者虔誠致敬！）他是軍務出身；雖說才三十左右，却是一臉兜腮鬍子；一雙眼睛，精光作作，照人生寒，却又語言　柔，思想細致；所以奉了上峯命令，担任着這種細緻的犯險工作。</p>
<p>（平常，一般社會，像這般年靑的三五個人，聚在這們一個旅社的房間內，我們可以不費心思，能够猜想得出他們「消閒」的精釆節目：要是不耐煩弄弄十六圈「無奇不有」的雀戰，定是「沙蟹」；要不，決定就是羅宋牌九。同時定然還要把各人的「貴相知」，從舞塲挑來的電影院搭上的，或是響導社無端發現的，等等，等等，像臨潼鬥寳一般，彼比各出所載，互相誇耀。</p>
<p>這時您要是無心踏進了這所房間，我可以担保，頭一下覺到的，定是滿眼烟霧，充耳的輕笑淺駡。您要是把這房裏的空氣，抓上一把，放在瓶子裏，請一位生物化學家分析分析，我想除了烟酒屁汗肉幾種顯明的臭味之外，大概還含有各式各類的毒素和細菌。</p>
<p>我想如若當局忽然來這們一個暴政，照上面所說，依式依樣，弄下這麽幾間房屋，門外寫明，「內有各種臭味，各式各類毒素和細菌，每個市民，必須出款若千，在內「消閒」二至八小時」，您想您會對這當局起反感嗎？我想眞有這事的話，無疑地，各黨各派，無黨無派，甚至迎小六子在內，都得爲了這一苛政揭杆而起；除了散傳單演說之外，遷得遊行示威，不是嗎？）</p>
<p>這時，鶴見守一等五人，都是滿腹心事，稍稍吃渴一點，同時集中思想，參詳這個「0915」的秘密，各有各的猜想，各有各的說法，却沒有一個肯定的結論。</p>
<p>他們討論了不久，旅社的侍應，忽然通了電話上來，說有一個日本軍人，指名要找一位山本正岩的說話。原來這人正是正岩約來査問的那個汽車勤務。</p>
<p>鶴見一見這人，認明即是淸晨開車來迎接他和萍子的那個駛車動務，這時却是穿的一等兵等級軍服，整整齊齊，好像來參加宴會的一般。鶴見也沒有小看他。鶴見說明了自己身份之後，當即半命令半客氣地請他坐下吃酒。那傢伙扭揑了一會，狠狠吿罪一番，才肯坐下。</p>
<h3>江天雪霽</h3>
<p>— 龔半千</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>贈品</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>華盛頓中央社廿六日電：杜魯門總統今日頒發一行政命令，命海軍部長福宋斯特爾將美海軍剩餘船隻二百七十一艘及其所需之浮動船塢等移交我國，不收任何代價。讀悉之餘，難免受寵若驚。這是老實話，正如朋友送給我的一對精美飯盌一樣，一直擱置着不用，原因是人不成雙，怎好把飯盌拆對？索性不用，當作鑑賞品，雖未免辜負了朋友贈送的雅意，但在我是無可如何的事。美國贈我二百七十一艘海軍船隻，我們豈能讓空船開來開去？我說受寵若驚，實在是老實話。</p>
<p>又細閱總統命令內容，有謂：「此類船隻及浮動船塢，應給予修理裝備以及撥予中國使用，保養所需之各項器材，中國對此項費用應以現金償付。」在借債渡日的情形下，「此項費用」如何籌措？</p>
<p>但人家送東西來，總得犒賞一下担東西來的使者，這又是「人情」，誰不懂得？那麽人家眞的送給我們一大批船隻，修理等等各項器材的費用，又怎好意思呌送的人負担？當然得自掏腰包呀！</p>
<p>且拋開這些問題不談。反正此項命令的實施，尙有待於國務卿馬歇爾的「最後裁奪」，距離「正式移交」還有一段相當的時間。趁這時候，我們怎樣去完成準備接收的工作？這還須我們大大地化一番手脚。</p>
<p>人家關心我們，希望我們在東亞站立起來，我們正該一掃過去積習，利用這時機，踏上復興之途。</p>
<h3>「櫃台獅子」</h3>
<p>— 麗泉</p>
<p>物價在無限止的上漲，職工　給是守住在原始的崗位上，妻孥老小的拖累，縱使不能生活下去，但怎敢向資方要求加薪？聲請工會向資方交涉吧，也必須要他們自己出面。而且工會的任務，是調解性質，向資方很難　蔽聲請人的姓名；所以結果縱使薪給能够獲得調整，但他們的飯碗問題，是必然的被種下了嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>假使能够：（一）强制職工入會，得呈請警局執行，如執行未果，由警局送請法院制裁。（二）非本業工會會員，資方不得任用，違則得由工會狀請法院判裁。（三）各業職工待遇，應由各該同業公會與工會訂立勞資協約，詳細規定之。（四）違背勞資協約時，被損害者方面之公會或工會，不必依據聲請辦理，得隨時自動調査交涉，或狀請法院制裁。那末工運有了切實的立塲，職工方面獲得合理的保障了。</p>
<p>但是，上面的希望是個「假使」的夢想。所以職工運動的苦悶，目前尙無法消滅；也就是職工的悲哀，還沒有到解除時候。這被人們稱爲「櫃台獅子」的一羣，同樣是國家生命中的細胞，社會組織由有力的一環，他們是善良的安份的人民，却被大家丢棄在一旁。（下）</p>

<h3>上海電台的播音節目</h3>
<p>— 誠文</p>
<p>上海廣播電台截至目前爲止，民營的，公營的，國營的電台，約有三十家之多。在量的方面，可以說很多了，然而在質的方面，却貧乏得可憐。</p>
<p>廣播事業在上海，也已經二十多年的歷史，但是直到現今，不但毫無必進步可言，目每况愈下，令人不勝感懷系之。</p>
<p>看看世界各國，已經進步到運用電化敎育了。而我們呢，却仍舊在那裏整天的大播肉麻，無聊，淫　的，爵士歌曲與流行小調，陳腐的舊劇唱片等等。或是些低級趣味，毫無意義的，彈詞，申曲，紹興戲，滑稽，鬼怪故事等等。</p>
<p>而僅有的敎育節目，除了一大淸早，整個收音機中都是敎授英文外，其他的敎育怖目，像國文，科學，民衆識字敎授，各種學識等等’簡直是鳳毛麟角，可以說是絕無僅有。尤其一到晚間，大家工作之餘，敎育節目却一家也沒有了，收音機中充塞了各種各樣低級無聊的遊藝節目。</p>
<p>希望各電台的主持人，應該爲國家，爲六衆着想，不要僅在爲錢打算盤，應該冬設實川的敎育，社會，兒童等節目（尤其是在晚間），使大家由空氣裏能够得到各種智識。</p>
<p>同時也希望電信當局，嚴格管制各電台的播音節目。敎育節目至少需佔百分之三十以上，尤其在晚間，必須要有敎育節目。</p>
<h3>蕭伯納名著　「璇宮艷后」</h3>
<p>— 司馬驊</p>
<p>坎及女皇的皇宮，現在顯得非常的混亂。說是羅馬戰士已經深入埃及了，而且愷撒已經帶領人馬，就要來到跟前。這時候的克里奧派屈拉，與其說她是女皇，毋寗說她是個小孩子，因爲她嚇得什麽似的。她已逃到沙漠，躱到獅身人面像的脚下。</p>
<p>這時候，夜色迷濛，寒風吹袂，她忽然遇到一位慈祥的老人，她吿訴這位老人，她是怎樣地懼怕着戰勝者愷撒的猙獰面貌。這位老人陪伴着她回到她流亡的沙漠皇宮，呌她千萬不要恐懼，如果一恐懼，她就不像個女皇。他見克里奧派屈拉很聽他的話，就告訴她他自己就是愷撒。她聽了之後，先是驚訝，接着就是狂喜，她接受愷撒對她的友誼，承認他是自己的朋友，而愷撒也答應敎導她怎樣去克服恐懼，而做一個眞正的女皇。</p>
<p>克里奧派屈拉的弟弟托萊梅，在亞歷山大登基，手下有許多大臣扶助，愷撒便帶了克里奧派屈拉到了亞歷山大城。托萊梅的背後，也是羅馬的軍隊，他們在幾年以前，爲了干列繼承王位問題，就到了坎及。這些羅馬人和埃及人在阿契拉斯將軍統領之下，爲了要保持自己的勢力，一致擁護這位一傀儡王帝」。</p>
<p>他們一心一意要在愷撒面前獻媚，把愷撒已經打敗了的敵人旁貝殺死。可是出於他們意料之外，愷撒却把他們這一舉動，認作毫無人性的暗殺。當下愷撒對他們說，「不管你們在這裏怎樣商識，我的軍隊已經浩浩蕩蕩地開進城來，把皇宮包圍得像鐵桶一般，如果你們不馬上撤離，我就要把所有的人拘禁起來當俘虜看待。」</p>
<p>這些大臣和將軍們一看形勢不對，便悻悻地走了，這一走，使克里奧派屈拉歡天喜地地坐上姚弟弟的龍位，愷撒敎導她怎樣去做一個眞正的女皇。（上）</p>
<h3>擱樓上的人倫</h3>
<p>— 幾幹</p>
<p>這幾天報上接連刋載逆倫的新聞，使讀報者個個都嘆息倫常大變。本來我們是一個特別看重人倫的國家，如今却演出這種絕對相反的惡行，自然要令人無限興嘆。</p>
<p>倫常所以大變，多數歸之於人心不古，道德淪亡，可是我們不信上海人就已墮落到如此地步，上海人和全國其他各地的同胞比較起來，委實沒有絲毫的不同。有之不過是一個環境而已。</p>
<p>就事論事，一切家庭的慘變大都起源於家庭的環境。上海人的家庭環境與別地不同之處，就是他往往一個家庭，祗有一個房間。這房間自然有大有小，然而其爲「聚談而居」則一。父母，兄弟·夫婦·兒女·姊妹·婆媳，等等，都飲食起居住一間屋裏。其中一個人的性情。好惡，習慣，職業都同自不同，却要他們實行最狹義的共同生活，豈不太難。</p>
<p>唐朝有個張公藝，九世同居，高宗問他同居而相安無事之道，就就寫了一百個「忍」字。可知大家庭中祗有每一員抱定忍受的決心，方能相處下去。可忍則忍，不可忍亦須忍，此中痛苦，可想而知。然而在從前的大家庭裏，其客觀的環境還相當寬大，從沒有父女翁媳同居一室的現象，現在上海的家庭，其相處的密接，實遠甚於從前的大家庭，因而它需要的「忍」字，當然也應比從前增加數十百倍。這貴是可能的事。</p>
<p>逆倫案中最嚴重的爲殺與姦。上海本是一個財與色的刺激最大的地方，再加以許多人朝夕接觸於一室。任何起居作息，都沒有秘密的可能，沒有退避的距離，自然種稱衝突，可以由此而起，種種逆倫的行爲，可之因此而造成。凡上種種，可說都是一個住的問題。住的問題不解決，則人倫還要繼續大變下去，除非是理想的大聖人，否則一切凡夫俗子被擁塞在一間擱樓之中，要他們談人倫大道理，總不是容易的事。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>蘭又向老祝再三表示，她的拒絕搭乘徐紹明的車子，並不就是說必須讓老祝給她們設法找車子；她自己也願意出去努力，拚着多出些錢，或許也能找到合適的機會。但這一點她是錯誤了！完全錯誤了！權勢她是沒有的，要講化錢，可眞化不起。這幾天的市面，從桂林上柳州，最公道的價錢是每個人五十萬元；有不少是照金干論價錢的，柳林到貴陽，要個四大條五大條不算希罕，司機那裏另外再得孝敬兩三條小黄魚，不然他可能會把你拋在中途而蘭身上能有幾個錢呢？一只二錢不到的結婚戒，還是洋金的。誰要？所以直到這時候，仍未解決這個難題。盧前當然是不很淸楚這許多曲折的。</p>
<p>「如果老祝願意讓他們跟我們一起定，我認爲是與劇團有益無損的。」張昌揮舞着他那支愛逾生命的口琴，像演說似的說：「胡太太那樣可驚的鎭定和溫文的性格，對我們至少是一種有力的鼓勵！」</p>
<p>「然而我們的車呢？唉！」盧跛子照例又長嘆了一聲。</p>
<p>他們的車子正由老祝用着極大的忍耐力在奔走。正當他們躺在地舖上撩天的時候，祝兆年却獨自枯坐在　　戰區司令長官部交通處的會客室裏。</p>
<p>這三天裏，他已經上這兒來過七次了，每次都坐在這一間長方形的小屋子裏；所坐的時間，最短是一小時左右，最久是四小時零三十六分，就是從大淸早來直到吃中飯。這七次像轅門聽鼓那樣等着使似的枯候，已使他不但認淸了這屋子的形象和內部的陳設，並且也說得出那方灰白色的檯布上給烟尾所燙焦的小孔共有若干，而他每次在枯候中消耗掉的糖量也頗有與日俱增之勢。（六十）</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Attends the Legislative Yuan to Report and Clarify Future Policy Objectives: Domestic Disputes Can Be Fundamentally Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Premier Zhang attended the Legislative Yuan for the first time on the morning of the 1st. While answering questions from legislators, he repeatedly emphasized that the new government will strive in many ways to bring a swift end to the military measures that the government was forced to take due to the suppression of the rebellion, so as to fundamentally resolve domestic disputes and restore unification through political means as soon as possible. Zhang pointed out solemnly that politics and economics are mutually cause and effect, and cannot be clearly distinguished. If political problems are not resolved, it will be difficult to achieve a balanced budget, currency reform, and price stabilization. Peace and unification are one and the the same, and democracy and the rule of law are also indistinguishable. In the future, the Executive Yuan's measures will give equal importance to both economic and political matters. The Cabinet will faithfully and bravely implement the resolutions of the State Council, make every effort to do so, and is willing to adopt opinions from all parties as a reference for policy making. Zhang assured the entire Legislative Yuan that the executive and legislative branches will be in a complementary relationship in the future. The Executive Yuan is willing to accept legal constraints, absolutely respect the principle of checks and balances, and will never disregard legislative matters. Zhang denied that the current government is merely a transitional institution from political tutelage to constitutional government, and used an analogy to explain: the government is like a car entrusted with transporting the blueprint for constitutional construction to the National Assembly, to serve as the foundation for the future construction of a constitutional and democratic government. Regardless of the car's mechanics, the driver's skills are limited to this, and there are many obstacles along the way. From departure to the destination, the driver must not only repair the car along the way but also pave roads and build bridges. The meaning of "transition" may be just like this. Zhang believes that China's economic construction should be based on self-reliance and should not rely solely on external assistance. Zhang said in a confident tone: "Our material resources are abundant, and our financial resources are rich. If we can unleash our potential and be self-reliant, it is not difficult. Heaven helps those who help themselves. Relying solely on external forces, as if there is no other way without foreign debt, this kind of dependence should be eliminated as soon as possible." Zhang believes that the past emergency economic measures were very effective in overcoming the economic crisis in February of this year. Without these measures, today's situation might not be like this. However, he pointed out that the authorities are paying attention to the current difficulties in the lives of civil servants. It is said that since the adjustment of the salaries of public school teachers and staff in December of last year, five months have passed without an increase. The reason for this is that since the implementation of the emergency economic measures, the cost-of-living index has been frozen. At the same time, the authorities have also implemented a ration system, which may compensate for a portion. Although prices are still rising, the main item is rice. The rationing of other items such as oil may solve a portion. The authorities do not intend to adjust salaries, but when considering this issue, they are also thinking of the following points: (1) the salaries of soldiers, (2) whether the salaries of public school teachers and staff at all levels other than the central and provincial levels should be adjusted at the same time, (3) the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises are better than those of other civil servants, but the difference is still significant compared to employees of general private enterprises, and this should also be taken into account. The authorities are currently collecting this type of material for reference in future adjustments.</p>
<p>Currency Reform Will Be Implemented Sooner or Later; Emergency Measures Being Considered for Revision</p>
<p>Regarding the currency reform proposed by the legislators, Zhang believes that all countries must reform their currency systems after a major war, and China is no exception. Therefore, currency reform is inevitable sooner or later. The current question is when to implement it and to ensure that it is effective. This matter should be realized as soon as possible, because opening up financial and economic difficulties should be premised on currency reform, and stabilizing currency value should be a prerequisite for currency reform. Zhang also stated in response to questions that the government attaches great importance to credibility and will not easily lose the trust of the people. At the same time, it will pay special attention to the "making the best use of talent." Zhang's attitude was sincere, and his speech was sonorous and forceful. He behaved throughout like a statesman and a man of action, without any affectation, leaving an excellent impression on the entire Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan attended the Legislative Yuan meeting for the first time on the 1st and reported on the policy guidelines, stating that emergency economic measures are insufficient to cope with the current economic situation, so the government's economic authorities are reviewing them. This measure is like an economic martial law, and its harsh nature cannot be tolerated by the people permanently. The government will thoroughly study this measure and then decide whether to revise or abolish it. When the emergency economic measures were implemented, they were able to temporarily curb the rise in prices, but they ultimately failed to freeze prices and maintain the salary standards of civil servants. The government has considered adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and staff while ensuring that prices are not affected.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Premier Zhang's Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Premier Zhang Qun, who attended the Legislative Yuan for the first time to report, gave a penetrating elaboration on the relationship between the executive and legislative powers in his speech, which lasted about 25 minutes. He also emphasized and called for cooperation between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan. Zhang first put forward the key points that should be paid attention to in current policies, as well as the actions and styles that must be adopted in economic and general administration. He said: In this stage of transition from political tutelage to constitutional government, the task of the Executive Yuan is to faithfully and effectively implement the national policies determined by the State Council in accordance with the highest guiding principles of the Three Principles of the People, based on the spirit of the Outline for Peaceful National Construction and the policy guidelines of the new government jointly agreed upon by the various parties. This is evident from the provision in Article 5 of the policy guidelines of the new government that "the Executive Yuan shall be fully responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the National Government Committee." Of course, in the process of implementation, we sometimes have to draft bills or budgets to be submitted to your Yuan, sometimes we have to formulate some implementation rules ourselves, sometimes we have to take into account the environment, distinguish priorities, and determine the implementation steps, and sometimes we have to make suggestions to the State Council based on practical needs or difficulties, requesting decisions, or requesting your Yuan to discuss them, but all of these are only the processes that should be had when implementing national policies. From a legal point of view, the mission of the Executive Yuan is still how to faithfully implement national policies, that is, how to thoroughly implement the laws formulated by your Yuan in accordance with national policies. The Executive Yuan cannot and should not take any action beyond the established national policies and existing laws, because if it does not do so, it is not democracy, it is not the rule of law. The so-called "the virtuous cannot exceed their authority to do good, and the unworthy cannot go beyond the law to do evil," these two sentences can well explain the spirit of the rule of law, and they can also fully explain the position of the Executive Yuan, so I am willing to declare responsibly that faithfully and effectively implementing the decisions of the State Council in accordance with the law is the rule and criterion for our future policies. We are willing to self-discipline ourselves with this, and we also want to use this spirit to supervise administrative organs at all levels across the country.</p>
<p>Explain Key Points of Policy and Promote Production and Construction</p>
<p>Regarding the key points of policy, Zhang reiterated the points he broadcast to the people across the country on April 23. Regarding economic issues, he put forward the short-term and long-term solutions that he broadcast, and further explained that, whether short-term or long-term, we believe that there is a need to establish a comprehensive one, because regular administrative organizations are divided according to various specialized administrative businesses or technologies. Among the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, there are as many as seven or eight units whose duties are related to economic matters. This is of course not a problem in the handling of regular government affairs or individual businesses, but when it comes to important, urgent, and broad-ranging issues such as stabilizing prices and promoting production and construction, every measure involves several ministries and commissions. For example, when it comes to controlling prices, it is related to at least the ministries of food, finance, transportation, social affairs, and economy. If there is no organization to strengthen the close ties between the various ministries and commissions, it will not be easy to achieve consistency in their actions, and the result will inevitably affect the implementation of policies. As for the work of promoting production and construction, this kind of coordination is even more important. Therefore, in today's extremely serious economic situation, we must bring together experts in various relevant businesses or technologies in society and the competent authorities in the government so that they can work together in an organization, under a certain policy, and under the principle of division of labor and cooperation, pooling wisdom and working seamlessly to achieve our goals. Although this organization is proposed by the government, the focus is on the industrialists and businessmen and specialized economic talents in society. If we do not do so, it will be difficult to cope with the current serious situation, and it will be even more difficult to talk about planned reforms. The Executive Yuan previously proposed the establishment of a National Economic Commission. We believe that this organization is necessary, and we hope that you will support it and pass it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Task is to Faithfully Implement Decisions</p>
<p>Zhang then raised general administrative issues, saying that in today's preparation for the implementation of constitutional government, what I think is most important is to establish a system, exert the role of checks and balances, and promote the spirit of respecting the law and being pragmatic. I have already reported to you earlier that in the current stage, the mission of the Executive Yuan is to faithfully and effectively supervise and implement the decisions of the State Council in accordance with the law. Here, we cannot but admit frankly that in the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the implementation of laws and regulations, due to the lack of material conditions and the instability of the lives of civil servants, as well as various other internal or temporary relationships, was not 100% thoroughly implemented. Therefore, it has aroused some criticism from some quarters. Everyone knows that the execution of national policies, after the completion of legislative procedures, becomes a technical problem. In other words, after national policies are made into laws, the next step is execution, and in the execution, the focus is on the method, and attention should be paid to how to execute it in order to effectively achieve the purpose of national policies. A slight mistake in the measures is enough to reduce the prestige of the law, or even hinder its implementation. Since we are responsible for the execution, we should make our best efforts to overcome all unfavorable environments in order to effectively and thoroughly implement national policies and laws. If, due to the evolution of the situation, the law becomes divorced from reality, and the administrative organs are unable to overcome its difficulties, then of course we must request the State Council to reconsider the decision itself, or request your Yuan to supplement or revise it in terms of law, so as to meet the needs of reality and avoid the indifference or perfunctoryness of lower-level governments to the law caused by impracticality.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan is Complementary</p>
<p>He then explained the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, saying: Many people think that the two Yuans are opposed to each other. On the 24th, a certain newspaper said in a headline "Sketch of the State Council Meeting": "Sun Ke and Zhang Qun sat opposite each other, symbolizing that future politics is the intersection of representative government and responsible cabinet, and the two will inevitably argue tit-for-tat." From the usual terminology, the so-called "opposition" or "tit-for-tat" may cause some people to misunderstand, but from the point of view of the political principle of checks and balances, the two Yuans are in fact complementary to each other. The two agencies are parallel, not opposed, because when the Legislative Yuan discusses the proposals of the Executive Yuan, in order to understand the motive of the proposal and its possible effect, it must of course repeatedly study it in order to decide whether it should be established. As for the law after it has been promulgated, the original legislative organ cannot but pay attention to its implementation, so as to provide a reference for future legislation or revision, because only in this way can the society develop respect for the law and the spirit of the rule of law. Frankly speaking, the Executive Yuan should absolutely accept the restraint of the law, and at the same time, it also hopes that your Yuan will understand its difficulties and trust its experience and sincerity. We attach absolute importance to the principle of checks and balances, and are willing to maintain the close relationship between the executive and the legislative branches in accordance with the provisions of the final paragraph of Article 5 of the policy guidelines of the new government.</p>
<p>He said at the end: In short, in the next eight months, the government must complete the preparations for the implementation of constitutional government on the one hand, and at the same time, it is even more anxious to restore national unity and stability and solve the current serious financial and economic problems. The administrative work is really extremely difficult, and we will ask you for advice and assistance at any time in the future. The current price problem is extremely serious, and the members must be very concerned, and they must have good opinions, so today we have invited the heads of the ministries and commissions related to economic problems, especially price problems, to attend at the same time, and we hope that they will not hesitate to give us guidance.</p>

<h3>Questions Raised by the Legislators Focused on Politics and Economy; Harmonious Atmosphere Paves the Way for Democracy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 1st, the questions raised by the legislators to Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various departments mainly focused on politics and economics. Some also inquired about the current military situation. The legislators spoke on behalf of the people and placed great expectations on the new Executive Yuan. They expressed their gratitude for Zhang's willingness to attend the Legislative Yuan, reversing the past practices of those in power. What the legislators are most concerned about is the nature of the new Executive Yuan. Legislators such as Zhong Tianxin believe that the new Executive Yuan is a political government and is only allowed to succeed in politics, not to fail. They hope that it can use 80% of its efforts to seek the realization of peaceful unification. If peace can be realized, other problems will be easily solved. Jian Guansan attaches importance to economic issues, believing that this is the most important test for the new government. He hopes that the new government will not be afraid of offending the powerful and will not compromise with the wealthy and powerful. Chen Guyuan and others appealed for the general public school teachers and staff and students studying abroad. Lu Fu hoped to respect the people's personal freedom and earnestly implement the provisions of Articles 2 and 8 of the Constitution and compete with each other in the implementation of democracy. Members such as Situ De also put forward opinions on political and economic issues and said that the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan are mutually supportive and are both responsible to the people and should work together and not be in a position of opposition. Today, the legislators spoke calmly and peacefully. Premier Zhang also said that he would come to the Yuan from time to time to listen to their teachings. The atmosphere in the meeting was harmonious, and applause was heard from time to time. It is generally believed that the relationship between legislation and administration will be like milk and water in the future, paving a smooth road for our country's democratic constitutionalism.</p>

<h3>Admiral Kirk Tells Reporters: There Are No US Military Bases in China; Qingdao is a Chinese Port and the US Navy Has No Right to Close It</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] US Navy Admiral Kirk held a press conference at the Cathay Hotel yesterday, and reporters from various newspapers asked questions, which Admiral Kirk answered one by one. The important ones are recorded as follows: (1) The rumor that the US Navy will close the port of Qingdao is untrue. Qingdao is a Chinese port, and the US Navy has no right to close it. (2) Of the ships recently donated to China by the United States, 97 ships are donated to the Navy, all with radar and complete weapons. Another 136 small ships are for customs use and must be paid for by the Chinese government. The handover of warships has no definite date, as it is still awaiting the completion of training of Chinese naval personnel. Some of these ships are now being used by the Chinese side. It is believed that in the near future, there will be detailed measures for the transfer of these ships. The US Navy in Qingdao is still assisting in the training of the Chinese Navy. The Chinese Navy Training Corps in Qingdao has made great progress. Kirk continued that foreign countries had mistakenly called Qingdao a US naval base, which is not true. The US Navy has no base in China. In Qingdao, it is only assisting in the training of the Chinese Navy. (3) He does not believe the rumor that weapons have been smuggled from Qingdao to the Communist area. (4) Regarding Moscow's accusations that the US Navy in Qingdao insulted Soviet expatriates, Kirk explained that it was because the US Navy took back some houses occupied by Soviet expatriates for the residence of naval families and personnel training the Chinese Navy. These houses were previously allowed to be occupied by Soviet expatriates by the Allied forces, but the term has long expired. (5) The US Navy in Peiping has been completely withdrawn, but the ground troops have not yet been completely withdrawn due to transportation problems. After Admiral Kirk finished speaking, he held a cocktail party at the Cathay Hotel to entertain the press and US Navy personnel in Shanghai, and introduced the new US Navy Public Relations Officer in Shanghai, Major Duffy, to meet with people from all walks of life. The original Public Relations Officer in Shanghai, Major Author, is about to leave the military. The meeting was pleasant, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. It was adjourned at 6:00 p.m. Admiral Kirk is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Qingdao on the morning of the 2nd.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Shanxi Province Gradually Becomes Serious: Yan Xishan Claims Communist Forces Plan to Attack Taiyuan; Fierce Battles Break Out Outside An'yi and Yuncheng</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping to This Newspaper, 1st] The situation in Shanxi is gradually becoming serious. Official sources state: The Communist forces are using the Zhongtiao, Lüliang, and Taihang Mountains as shields. Communist forces from northern Shaanxi, western Hebei, and northern Henan are continuously entering Shanxi. They are using the Yanmen Pass to prevent Fu Zuoyi's troops from moving south, controlling Niangziguan in the east to prevent the Guomindang forces of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters from advancing west, and attacking various locations along the Yellow River in the southwest to control the river crossings, preventing the Guomindang forces of Shaanxi and Henan from moving north, thereby isolating the four strategic points of Taiyuan, Linfen, Datong, and Yuncheng.

On the evening of the 30th, two brigades attacked strategic points such as Qinquan Station. The Sixth Field Brigade has infiltrated Xiaodian, a hundred miles northwest of Taiyuan. Yao Zhe, the commander of the Sui-Mongolian Military Region, has been transferred to commander of the Lüliang Military Region, leading the new Fifth Brigade of Wang Chijun's forces. The remaining forces retreated from northern Shanxi to the Xinzhou area, while another brigade retreated south from northern Yanmen to Jixian County.

<h3>Editorial: Observing the Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Conference</h3>
<p>The first plenary session of the Jiangsu Province’s 36th year administrative conference opened yesterday in Zhenjiang. Administrative inspectors from various districts and county magistrates from across the province traveled to the provincial capital to attend the conference. The session is scheduled for five days, during which they will discuss issues related to civil affairs, finance, food administration, education, construction, public welfare, people's livelihood, public security, conscription, and local autonomy. Chairman Wang Maogong emphasized in his opening address that political affairs should align with the military recovery, striving for the restoration of local security and order. Chairman Chiang, amidst his busy schedule, also issued a written exhortation, encouraging all provincial administrative officials to "promote production, maintain security, advance local autonomy, and prepare for the implementation of constitutional governance." This indicates the convening of this provincial administrative conference holds extremely significant meaning. Though we are situated in the city, and recently because of the entangled and unresolved national affairs and the repeated upheavals in international politics, our gaze often turns to the developments in domestic and international situations; however, our hearts constantly remember the localities, especially the politics of Jiangsu Province, which is of utmost concern to us. Therefore, we not only attach great importance to the convening of the Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Conference, but also hold great expectations for it.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province, whether observed from a geographical, economic, or cultural perspective, can be divided into two distinctly different areas: Subei and Jiangnan. These two regions are separated only by the Yangtze River, yet they share few similarities and are almost two unrelated entities. After the victory against Japan, the problem of the Communist Party further transformed Subei and Jiangnan into two distinctly different worlds. In Jiangnan, though devastated after eight years of war, under the rule of the government, as long as it can encounter honest and wise local officials, with clear political measures and allowing the people to rest, it would not be difficult for Jiangnan to gradually awaken from the ashes of war. However, in Subei, although the war was won, Subei was not yet recovered, still suffering from the poison and devastation of the Chinese Communist Party, even exceeding the ravages of the enemy. Now, the national army has finally recovered it, and the sun and moon shine again, but looking out over Subei, it is a scorched earth with scars everywhere. How can the administration of each administrative region and its counties align with the military recovery? And how can the kind and innocent compatriots of Subei be rescued from their deep suffering? According to Chairman Wang Maogong’s report: “If the bandit atmosphere in Shandong Province is not quelled for a single day, the danger in Subei will not cease for a single day. Therefore, the sixth and eighth administrative inspectors were unable to attend the meeting.” The situation in Subei remains extremely serious to this day, as can be seen from this simple report.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the local administration of Jiangsu, due to the differences between Subei and Jiangnan, absolutely needs to implement measures that are "adapted to local conditions." Considering the needs of the current actual situation, Subei should strive to coordinate politics with the military recovery to restore order and security. In Jiangnan, efforts should be made to promote the prosperity of the local economy. Chairman Wang, at the administrative conference, loudly proclaimed security as the top priority, which seems too biased towards Subei. We cannot help but point out here that if Jiangnan still cannot be stabilized and continues to emphasize security as the top priority, then Jiangnan is indeed too pitiable. Wang Maogong has been in charge of Jiangsu's administration for nearly two years. If, for the administration of Jiangnan's counties, he still focuses on security, then his achievements over the past two years are self-evident. It is precisely because we value the administration of Jiangsu Province, and precisely because we are particularly concerned about the future of Jiangsu Province, that we cannot help but take advantage of the provincial administrative conference's discussion of the administration of various counties to briefly describe our observations on the local situation, hoping to provide a reference for the local officials attending the conference.</p>
<p>Firstly, how should the local administration of the recovered areas in Subei align with the military recovery? We believe that the most important thing is to win back the hearts of the people. In today's democratic era, if an opposition party wants to seize power, it must win back the hearts of the people. Only after gaining the support and love of the majority of the people can it seize power. This is the only rule of democratic politics. Even the ruling party, if it wants to consolidate its acquired power, must also be able to maintain the hearts of the people, so that they do not collapse. Reflecting on ourselves regarding the occurrence of the Chinese Communist Party problem, we cannot help but admit our own lack of progress, which allowed the Communist Party to use corruption as a tool for propaganda to the people. The administration of areas under the control of the CCP may not necessarily be very brilliant, but the average people are ultimately not easy to distinguish. Now, the people of Subei, after being governed by the CCP, have returned to the rule of the government. Those who are subject to the governance will definitely be able to see the quality of the politics like fire. The people of Subei are all kind, patriotic people. When they were under the CCP's rule, they longed for the rule of the central government. Now that they have been recovered, their hopes have been realized, but the local administration after the recovery must not disappoint them again. Therefore, the success or failure of Subei's administration is not only related to Jiangsu Province, but also to the overall political situation. But how to win back the hearts of the people? It is definitely not effective to simply restore order and security. We hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Conference will pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jiangnan has always been a rich and fertile area with abundant resources. Although it has been devastated after eight years of war, restoring its vitality is certainly not an easy task. But it depends on human effort. Jiangnan relies on its natural resources, as long as the local officials can all love the people like their own children, deeply understand the suffering of the people, and in the active aspect, encourage production and maintain security, so that the people can live and work in peace; in the passive aspect, allow the people to rest and do a few fewer things that harass the people. In this way, Jiangnan will not find it difficult to restore its old appearance. As for the local improvements and reforms that should be undertaken, they must be handled according to their urgency and priority. It is absolutely necessary to avoid being ambitious and unrealistic, so that any improvements and reforms are measures that are not beneficial to the people's livelihood. The administrative inspectors of various districts and the county magistrates have all come from the people and deeply understand the hardships of the people. Regarding the matters of local improvement and reform, they will naturally not engage in empty talk and be out of touch with reality. At present, the most urgent task of local administration is to seek the people's peaceful and prosperous life, thereby cultivating the people's vitality. If the people's livelihood is revived, then local prosperity will naturally follow.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this year is the year of constitutional implementation in our country. The constitution passed by the National Assembly will be implemented on December 25th of this year, and the foundation of constitutional governance lies primarily in local autonomy, especially the county, which is the grassroots organization of the autonomous unit. Therefore, if local politics are not handled well, then constitutional governance is equivalent to building castles in the air. The National Assembly representatives and legislative members will soon hold general elections, and candidates have already begun preparing for the elections. But if the people of each locality do not know how to exercise the four political rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, then the true meaning of holding general elections will be greatly discounted, and our empty talk of implementing constitutional governance will be of no benefit to true democratic politics. Therefore, we believe that localities, during this transitional period of constitutional implementation, should actively prepare for the implementation of constitutional governance, so as not to fail Chairman Chiang's expectations of "promoting local autonomy and preparing for the implementation of constitutional governance."</p>
<p>In short, Jiangsu is the leading area of our country. Those in charge of Jiangsu Province should build Jiangsu into a model province for the whole country. Its success or failure is not only related to Jiangsu Province, but also has a very close relationship with local politics throughout the country.</p>

<h3>UN Steering Committee Discusses for Ten Hours: Arab Group's Request Rejected, Guo Taiqi Supports the Positions of Britain and the United States, Hoping for a Just Resolution to the Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] The request by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia for the UN Special Assembly to hold an open debate and decide on Palestinian independence has been rejected by a resolution of the Assembly's Steering Committee. Today, according to Arab spokesmen, the Arab countries will request the Special Assembly to overturn the Steering Committee's resolution. However, the British and American delegations are confident that the Arab countries will not be able to obtain a two-thirds majority in favor. During the vote on the debate over Palestinian independence in the Steering Committee, only Egypt voted in favor. Of the Arab countries with representatives on the Steering Committee, only Egypt was present. China, Britain, the United States, France, Ecuador, Canada, Sweden, and Honduras voted against it, while Czechoslovakia, Brazil, the Soviet Union, Poland, and India abstained. The Steering Committee engaged in intense debate for ten hours, and Egypt tried to prevent the committee from voting, but to no avail. The Indian representative expressed sympathy for both Arabs and Jews, and ultimately abstained during the vote.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Flushing Meadows, 30th] The Steering Committee of the UN Special Assembly held a meeting at 7:15 PM today, chaired by the Brazilian representative, Aranha, and invited Arab representatives to participate in the discussion. The Chinese representative, Guo Taiqi, spoke, firmly opposing the demands made by the Arab representatives, and said that he did not believe that Palestinian independence was the only solution to this problem. Only proposals that are beneficial to the countries of the United Nations and the countries concerned can be thoroughly discussed. The UN Assembly should wait until the Fact-Finding Committee submits its report, and then hold a plenary session in September for thorough discussion before passing a resolution. Therefore, I cannot support the Arab representatives' request to include their proposal in the agenda of the Special Assembly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Guo Taiqi told Chinese reporters today that he believed that this meeting would be limited to discussing the organization of the Palestine Investigation Committee and its terms of reference. Guo continued, saying that many countries' delegations agreed with China's opinion that it was not yet the time for the Assembly to discuss the substance of the Palestine issue, as this kind of issue is extremely complex and requires careful and objective research. Guo said that, as far as China is concerned, the Chinese delegation supports a fair and peaceful solution for both the Jews and Arabs in Palestine, as well as other relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Austin Meets with Marshall: The US Agrees to Establish an Investigative Committee in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] The chief representative of the United States to the United Nations, Austin, met with Secretary of State Marshall today to discuss the US strategy in the United Nations Special General Assembly. Austin told reporters that they had reviewed the entire situation and various methods to allow the Special Assembly to conduct its affairs in a fair and beneficial manner. They also discussed how to give all stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions after the Assembly passed a resolution to establish an investigative committee. He believes that the Special Assembly should only discuss the British proposal to establish a fact-finding committee.</p>
<h3>UN Security Council Decides to Publish the Staff Committee Report: Whether an International Police Force Can Be Established Remains to Be Consulted</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 1st Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council today unanimously passed a resolution to publish the first report of its Military Staff Committee on the establishment of an international police force. The publication date is this Saturday, to be seen in newspapers on Sunday. The committee believes that this report is not confidential, so it has decided to make it public.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 1st] According to informed sources, the report of the United Nations Military Staff Committee lists the various differing views of the five major powers on the strength of the future United Nations forces, but because some issues involve political relations, the Security Council will be left to make decisions on these points of disagreement. The five major powers unanimously agree on the necessity of forming an international force, but the Soviet Union believes that each country should determine the amount of its participation in the international force based on the weight of its responsibility, which should be proportional to its military strength. As for the location of the international force, the five major powers have three different views on this: (1) China, Britain, and the United States believe that the international force may be stationed in any place where all countries participating in the international force can legally go; (2) the Soviet Union believes that the stationing location of the international force should be limited to the territories and territorial waters of former enemy countries; (3) France believes that the international force should not only be stationed in former enemy countries and trust territories, but also, through freely established agreements, be stationed within the territories of some United Nations member states. In addition, France also suggested that strategic zones should also be occupied by international forces.</p>

<h3>The US Plans to Allocate Huge Sums to Build a Bomber Base</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 1st Broadcast: The United States plans to use $14 million to establish an atomic bomb heavy bomber base in Aroostook, Maine. This plan will strengthen the US Air Force's bombing power. The base is located in the northernmost part of the United States, just four miles west of the Canadian border, on the short invasion route between the United States and Europe. US Air Force General Spaatz has repeatedly stated that it is necessary to establish this bomber base to resist any aggressor in Europe.</p>
<h3>US Foreign Relief Bill: The House Passes an Amendment, Reducing $350 Million to $200 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The House of Representatives today, by a vote of 333 to 66, passed an amendment to the Foreign Relief Bill, reducing the relief funds from $350 million to $200 million. It has now been sent to the Senate for discussion. The government hopes to restore the original amount. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has unanimously approved the full appropriation of $350 million. The amendment passed by the House stipulates that the countries receiving relief should generally be limited to China, Italy, Greece, Austria, Hungary, and Poland. Any government dominated by the Soviet Union cannot receive relief unless those countries agree to strictly control the relief goods and supervise the actual distribution. $15 million of the relief funds will be used for relief in Trieste and other places. Another $15 million will be allocated to the United Nations Children's Relief Fund. At least 90 percent of the relief goods should be purchased in the United States. Countries that draw compensation from current production are not allowed to receive US relief. American newspapers have the right to report on the distribution of relief goods, without censorship. The administration of relief distribution matters will be managed by an independent foreign relief agency, rather than by the State Department.</p>
<h3>Indian Constituent Assembly Passes Ban on "Untouchability": Guaranteeing Basic Human Rights Is Internal Reform</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] The Indian Constituent Assembly has just passed provisions in the Constitution of the Indian Union guaranteeing people's freedom of speech and publication, as well as equal opportunities.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] The Constituent Assembly yesterday passed a ban on "Untouchability," guaranteeing basic human rights. It stipulates that anyone who practices this doctrine constitutes a criminal offense, and this clause will be recommended for inclusion in the new Indian Constitution. According to recent census results, 49 million Hindus belong to the so-called "Scheduled Classes," those who are prohibited from contact with ordinary believers are included within this and the exact number is unknown. The untouchability doctrine only applies to the lower classes of people who perform extremely menial jobs, such as sanitation workers. They are not allowed to enter ordinary temples. Touching or approaching an Indian of worth is considered disrespectful. It is especially strict in the South, and even "sight" is also prohibited. Some areas stipulate the distance that must be maintained on public streets between them and higher-caste Indians, and they must notify them in advance when approaching. Social and religious privileges cannot be enjoyed. They live in villages, forming their own districts, isolated from the outside world. The majority of them have converted to Christianity or Islam because of the impartiality.</p>

<h3>US Aid to Greece Plan: The Term Should Be Extended to Five Years, Argues the Head of the US Economic Delegation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] The head of the US Economic Delegation to Greece, Porter, who went to Greece to investigate the country's economic situation, has long suggested a five-year extension to guarantee the country's future. Although Greece has received $700 million worth of foreign aid in the past two years, it still faces many difficulties if it wants to continue to survive. He hopes that the United States will not need to directly assist Greece after the loan expires in June 1948, but can still provide assistance in another way, either by the United States itself or by United Nations agencies. In order to support the morale of the Greek people, I propose that the United States should express its opinion to continue to assist Greece.</p>
<p>As for the United States organizing a committee to be responsible for monitoring the distribution of American aid, I believe that the number of people on this committee should be kept to a minimum. The purchase of goods from abroad by Greece should be the responsibility of the governments of both the United States and Greece, as well as American merchants and Greek importers, under the control of the American government, but the monitoring committee should also obtain broad powers. As for the military committee, it must be completely aligned with the Greek army and the British garrison, and should maintain contact with both the US Army and Navy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The head of the US Economic Delegation, Porter, estimated that the five-year plan to revive Greece would require approximately $335 million, and then suggested that other countries could share $140 million, and estimated that maintaining appropriate military equipment alone would cost approximately $180 million next year.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Faces Another Crisis: Workers' Demands for Pay Raises Cause Division</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 30th] France's latent political crisis has now surfaced again. The cabinet discussed the Renault auto factory labor strike problem today, and the five Communist Party cabinet members, failing to support the workers' pay raise demands, angrily walked out of the meeting. A majority of members of parliament expect that the Communist Party will announce its withdrawal from the government at a special cabinet meeting to be held tomorrow night. One member of the Radical Socialist Party said that US President Truman's aid plan for Turkey and Greece has triggered an attempt by the anti-communist faction in France to exclude the Communist Party and form a new government, and a cabinet crisis seems inevitable.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Reliable sources say that the Communist Party cabinet members intended to resign from Prime Minister Ramadier's office this morning. After persuasion, they agreed to wait for French President Auriol to return to Paris from French West Africa tomorrow before taking definite action. Official announcement: An emergency cabinet meeting is scheduled to be convened tomorrow evening, presided over personally by the president. It is heard that the reason given by Communist Party leader Thorez for the resignation of the Communist Party cabinet members was only a few words: "The Communist Party has changed its price and wage policy." Prime Minister Ramadier still insists on the official policy of the cabinet, which is to maintain price stability and not allow general wage increases.</p>
<h3>Report on the Moscow Conference Proceedings - Full Text of Marshall's Speech (Continued)</h3>
<p>Wide Discrepancy Between US and Soviet Views on German Reparations</p>
<p>The issue of reparations... This issue is of utmost importance, as almost all other issues will be affected by it. The people of several Allied nations who suffered from German occupation and whose homes and cities were ravaged by German troops attach great importance to this issue.</p>
<p>The experience of the Versailles Treaty of 1919, which based reparations on cash payments, and the difficulties encountered by the Reparations Commission after the Yalta Conference in discussing the cash value of reparations in kind, led President Truman and his advisors at the Potsdam Conference to believe that in order to avoid continuous friction and animosity, a different basis for determining reparations must be adopted. As a result of their discussions, they agreed on a principle of reparations, which was to pay reparations from capital assets, that is, to move German factories, machinery, etc. to the Allied nations concerned.</p>
<p>However, at the Moscow Conference, Soviet officials completely disagreed with President Truman and Mr. Byrnes' understanding of the wording of this agreement. On this point, the British opinion was largely the same as that of the United States.</p>
<p>We believe that the original intent of the Potsdam Agreement did not include obtaining reparations from current production. The Soviet Union strongly opposed this view. They believed that the previous Yalta Conference agreement had allowed the Soviet Union to obtain billions of dollars in reparations from current production. This would mean that a portion of the factories in Germany that are constantly producing would continue to pay reparations, which would prolong the period for Germany to restore its self-sufficient economy. The US government had planned to revitalize the German economy within three years and end US economic assistance to the residents of the occupied areas. In this way, the US government's plans and hopes would be shattered.</p>
<p>This is an extremely complex issue. The four powers have expressed their desire to see Germany become an economic whole. We must reach an agreement on this point.</p>
<p>However, there have also been general agreements among the Allied nations, such as reviewing the factories and equipment that can be moved from Germany as part of the reparations. They understand that the result of excessively weakening the German industrial organization will not only make it difficult to achieve Germany's self-sufficiency plan, but also hinder the economic recovery of the entire Europe. Some factories have already been designated for compensation and removal, but current needs require them to remain in Germany. For these types of factories, the United States has indicated its willingness to begin studying the possibility of obtaining limited compensation from current production, but one condition must be established: the payment of compensation from current production must not increase the financial burden of the powers carrying out the occupation tasks, nor delay the repayment of loans granted by the Allied nations to Germany to avoid the collapse of the German economy. The Soviet government has not responded to this proposal. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Minister Gu Sympathizes with Workers' Demands - Recognizes Index as a Reasonable System - To Convene Labor and Management Representatives from Various Industries Today and Tomorrow to Collect Information - To Provide Central Government with Reference for Decision-Making After Returning to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs visited the financial community in this city yesterday, including Chen Guangfu and Xu Jijing, to solicit opinions from all parties on the unfreezing of the cost-of-living index. Labor and management representatives from various industries will be convened separately today and tomorrow to collect relevant information. According to Mr. Gu's statement to this newspaper's reporter last night: I personally sympathize with the workers' demands for improved treatment. However, when advocating for improving the lives of workers, attention should also be paid to the overall economic situation. Using the cost-of-living index for salary is a reasonable system. The stability of Shanghai's production sector in the past year should be attributed to the adoption of the cost-of-living index. Currently, there are many factors contributing to the economic downturn in industry and commerce, such as outdated machinery, improper management, and excessive interest rates, which cannot be blamed on high wages. In fact, in terms of today's prices in Shanghai, wages cannot be said to be too high. The real issue today is how to improve the productivity of workers. When I was in Beijing, I paid attention to the materials on the living conditions of workers. After arriving in Shanghai, I collected more information from various sources and studied it in detail. After returning to Beijing, I will put forward suggestions for the central government to refer to for decision-making. The implementation of differential subsidies benefits group workers and disadvantages technicians. I recently met with people in the banking industry, and their opinions on whether the index should be unfrozen are quite divided. I believe that the lives of workers must be stable in order to increase production. I hope to stabilize wages by stabilizing prices, otherwise, even if wages increase, workers will not receive real benefits. On the other hand, workers should also understand that the treatment of public school teachers and soldiers at the front is even worse than theirs. They should adopt an attitude of patience, and once the national economy is stable and progressing, the lives of workers will be greatly improved. (The above picture is of Minister Gu, photographed by this newspaper.)</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Textile Society Opens - Zhu Xianfang Delivers a Speech Presenting Three Hopes - Papers to be Read and Topics Discussed Today</h3>
<p>The 12th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Textile Society opened yesterday morning at Yiyuan on Fuxing Middle Road. More than 300 members of the society and guests, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Chief Secretary Xie, and representatives from various bureaus, attended. Zhu Xianfang, Luo Yangzhi, Gao Shiheng, Zhang Jiuqian, Wu Shihhuai, and others served as the presidium. First, Chairman Zhu Xianfang delivered the opening speech, reporting on the society's affairs over the past year, stating briefly: After the victory, the textile industry has gradually come to life with the takeover of textile and dyeing factories of enemy assets throughout the country. In total, there are currently 4.6 million cotton spindles, 480,000 yarn spindles, and 28,000 looms in the country. The takeover portion is large-scale and is operated by the China Textile Construction Company organized by the government. Since its establishment, it has been very profitable and effective. It is hoped that the wise authorities will fulfill their responsibilities and use future profits for the revival and construction of the textile industry. For example, 70-80% of the profits could be used to purchase machinery and equipment, 10-20% to improve raw materials, or to be used for cultivating specialized talents and research funding. It is estimated that fifteen years later, it will be possible to realize the National Father’s proclamation of "providing clothing for the people." In addition, it is hoped (1) to organize a textile industrial zone survey team, select experts, and survey and determine the construction of cotton, wool, silk, and hemp factory areas based on the conditions for establishing factories, so as to avoid the past regret of concentrating in one corner, making procurement and transportation inconvenient. (2) State-owned textile factories should produce more exports and compete in the international market in order to overcome the Japanese textile industry and eliminate its own threat. (3) Manufacture machines suitable for China's environment, and improve work and management techniques. Next, Speaker Pan, Chief Secretary Xie, Shu Yunzhang, and others delivered speeches separately. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. After a group photo was taken, the Textile Management Committee hosted a luncheon. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM to discuss the society's affairs, revise the constitution, and re-elect directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Today, it will continue for one day at the original location. Papers will be read and topics discussed in the morning, and members will give speeches. In the afternoon, visits will be made to the Textile Construction Company, printing and dyeing, wool spinning, and silk factories.</p>

<h3>Using US Dollars to Acquire Foreign Shares - Zongyong Trading Company Investigated for Violations - Two Employees Admit Without Reservation</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau recently received a report that the Zongyong Trading Company at 301 Citibank Building, 45 Jiujiang Road, was suspected of secretly trading black market US dollars under the guise of operating in American stocks.

<h3>Committee Member Reported for Taking Bribes to Release German Nationals Privately</h3>
<p>Chairman Jiang Approved Transfer to the Municipal Government for Thorough Investigation - Police Bureau Transfers Case File to the District Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai German National Management Committee was previously secretly reported to Chairman Jiang of the National Government for taking bribes to release German nationals suspected of being pro-enemy. The chairman approved the transfer to the Executive Yuan, instructing the Municipal Government to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the order from Mayor Wu, the police bureau was ordered to be responsible for the investigation. According to the secret report, German national Kai Xiaohanen resided in this city during the Japanese occupation of this city in the 29th year of the Republic. During his time in Shanghai, he colluded with the Japanese Mitsui Trading Company to transport coal for the enemy and established the Hanen Trading Company to serve the enemy. After the victory, Kai bribed the German National Management Committee to change his status to a stateless foreigner and later obtained a Chinese naturalization certificate, and then went to Manila to this day. When he was engaged in bribery activities, Hanen still had 84 tons of white coal and dozens of tons of other coal that were not confiscated as enemy assets. According to the prices at that time (i.e., the 35th year of the Republic), the value was estimated at more than 50 million yuan. The police bureau ordered an investigation, and it has recently come to an end. The entire file was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling yesterday.</p>
<h3>Spectacular Scene at the Racecourse - Umbrellas Form a Forest - Music and Firecrackers Mixed with Cheers - Laborers Throughout the City Celebrate the Holiday - Variety Show Canceled Due to Rain</h3>

(2) In order to stabilize life, in addition to labor-management cooperation and the government stabilizing prices, workers should also strive to increase production.

<h3>Trial of "Shemale," a Woman Faints - The Drug Portion of the Case Concluded and Sentenced - Four Female Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment Separately - Unanimously Denied Drug Use and Requested Re-examination, Which Was Not Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The drug portion of the "shemale" case was directly tried in court by the District Court in accordance with the special criminal case litigation procedure at 2:00 PM yesterday. After the debate ended, Judge Shao Renjie announced the verdict in court: "Shen Junru is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for smoking opium and three years of imprisonment for helping others smoke opium. The sentence should be executed for five years, and he is ordered to quit drugs within four months. Zhou Shuzhen is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for smoking opium and two years of imprisonment for helping others smoke opium. The sentence should be executed for three years, and she is ordered to quit drugs within four months. Wu Fan Yanheng and Wang Ding Baoshu are each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for smoking opium. Xu Aqiao and Zhang Xiuzhen are acquitted and each pays a written guarantee of 2 million yuan." The requests for bail from the first, second, third, and fourth defendants were rejected, and they were still returned to custody. The portion of the case involving obscenity will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The decision on whether or not to hear the case will be made after the disposition.</p>
<p>The "shemale" case has attracted close attention from the society since it was announced by the police bureau. The District Court decided to hear the case especially early yesterday morning. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Shao of the Second Criminal Court took the seat and signed for the six defendants, including Shen Junru, to be brought to court. After the roll call, the two maids were questioned first. According to Zhang Xiuzhen: 44 years old, from Suzhou. She came to work at Shen's house (Wu Fan Yanheng's house) through the introduction of a maid in Chen's house on February 26th of this year. She is in charge of rough work such as washing and cooking and does not enter the room. Therefore, she has no way of knowing whether the owner has smoked opium.</p>
<p>According to Xu Aqiao: 24 years old, from Changshu. She has only been in Shen's house for more than a month and is in charge of cleaning the room. Xu also denied that the owner smoked opium. The court then questioned Ding Baoshu. According to the testimony: He is from Shandong, 47 years old. He moved to Shen's house because of a family dispute in Zhou Shuzhen's house. He heard that he was not feeling well, so he went to visit him. He met Shen Junru in a friend's house before the war and is not very friendly. He smoked opium five or six years ago, but he has already quit. When the police bureau came to search, he was in the living room. The court continued to question, according to the police report, opium was found in your handbag. Since you don't smoke, what do you need this drug for? He stammered and replied: "I never hid opium in my handbag. I don't know what's going on."</p>
<p>Hiding Her Face with a Handkerchief to Avoid Photography</p>
<p>At that time, a photographer pulled out a camera and aimed the lens, intending to take pictures of the four defendants. Ding and Zhou, etc., were standing in the defendant's bar and could not escape, so they quickly covered their faces with handkerchiefs and were very shy. Only the "shemale" Shen Junru was fearless.</p>
<p>Judge Shao then questioned Wu Fan Yanheng. According to the testimony, he had previously smoked opium because he had kidney disease and high blood pressure. He no longer smokes now. He does not go to Shen's house every day. He also does not know whether Shen Junru and others smoke opium. Fan was wearing a blue silk cheongsam and a black coat, and looked haggard. He often stroked his head with his right hand during the trial. Zhou Shuzhen was questioned again. According to the testimony: She is from Nanjing, 48 years old. She smoked opium in Chongqing because she had bronchitis, but she stopped smoking after coming to Shanghai. The court took out opium lamps, opium pipes, and other items. Zhou said: These smoking utensils are all mine. I used them before, but I have put them aside. He pointed to the opium lamp and said: This is an "air raid lamp" for boiling water. He left home due to a family dispute and is temporarily living with Shen Junru. Ding and Fan are all friends who came to visit me. Judge Shao then began questioning the "shemale." Shen Junru had changed into women's clothing, wearing a blue Shilin cloth cheongsam and a black coat. He was thin and tall, with his hair parted on the left and right, in a male style. He testified: He tried smoking opium ten years ago because he suffered from high blood pressure, but he has long since quit. Zhou Shuzhen is a friend of mine, and she came to live with me after leaving home. He only rented the house at Elizabeth Apartments for two months. He used to live in Wu Fan Yanheng's house at 73 Sofa Garden. It is a false accusation to say that I smoke opium.</p>
<p>Wu Fan Yanheng Faints in Court</p>
<p>Judge Shao instructed: According to the forensic examination, all four of you have slight signs of drug use. The pills and medicines seized also contain opium ingredients, which proves that smoking opium is a fact. He also announced the start of the debate. At that time, Wu Fan Yanheng suddenly fell out of the defendant's bar and fainted on the ground. Judge Shao ordered the bailiff to help him up and immediately summoned a forensic doctor to the court to treat him. Seeing that his pulse was still normal, he was allowed to sit down and continue the interrogation. There were many family members of the defendants in the audience. After Wu Fan Yanheng fainted, there was a commotion in the audience. Fan's family also called a doctor, intending to inject Fan with morphine to relieve the pain, but was reprimanded by Judge Shao. Six defense lawyers for the defendants all argued that although the defendants held smoking utensils and the forensic doctor found slight signs of drug use, it was still insufficient to determine that the defendants had committed the crime of smoking opium. They requested a re-examination and applied for bail. All were not approved by the court.</p>

<h3>Re-examination of the Zang Da Erzi Case: US Military Court Replies Difficulty in Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the US military court declared Raoul Trick not guilty in the Zang Da Erzi case, the local court of this city protested to the US military court a few days ago on two points: (1) Raoul admitted to beating Zang Da Erzi when he testified in our court with the instigator, Lai Lingnai; (2) The facts and evidence of the US military court's judgment are incomplete, and the records and evidence of the Chinese court should be consulted for reconsideration and heavy sentencing. Yesterday, the local court received a reply from the US military court, which was forwarded by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating briefly: The US military court is very interested in the request of the Chinese court. However, according to Article 5 of the US Constitution, "No person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb," it is therefore inconvenient to violate the Constitution.</p>

<h3>Yingshi University Relocation Movement; Student Representatives Petition Minister Zhu; All Professors Have Offered Positive Support</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinhua Special Dispatch] Yingshi University has recently fallen into an atmosphere of unease and anxiety due to the issue of its location. In recent days, slogans have been posted everywhere on campus, and meetings have been held everywhere. All members of the university are unanimously demanding to move away from Jinhua. The factual background is as follows:</p>
<p>The university was established during the war and wandered around Yunhe Xiaoshun and Taishun Liguang in southern Zhejiang. For several years, there was no equipment and it was difficult to form a scale. When Chen Lifu was the Minister of Education, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution that the university should be relocated to Shanghai and Wuxing after the war, one to commemorate the martyrdom of Mr. Yingshi and the other to make up for the university's congenital deficiencies. Therefore, as soon as victory arrived two months later, the university took the lead in moving to Wenzhou to reorganize and receive orders for recovery. Later, in order to adjust the national education program, the Ministry of Education suddenly changed the location of Yingshi University to Jinhua in eastern Zhejiang. Last year, there were many accidents on campus and the situation was not stabilized. The university hurriedly moved to Jinhua. Unexpectedly, after arriving, all that was seen was dilapidated tiles and broken walls, and there was no school building to settle in. Later, although the university spent a lot of money to requisition and repair all the broken temples, ancestral halls, temples, and prisons in Jinhua to provide temporary use, it was difficult to accommodate everyone due to the narrow space. Moreover, after the destruction of the various wars in eastern Zhejiang, the local culture has been generally devastated. All bookstores, sports fields, and even entertainment venues are simple and pitiful. All teachers and students of the university have no place to go outside of class and reading, and there is nowhere to go. Therefore, three months ago, all teachers and students of the university jointly held a general opinion test on the issue of relocation. The result was that 97% of the people advocated relocation. President Yang Gongda promised to go to Nanjing to discuss with the Ministry of Education. At the end of February of this year, he set off, but after two months, not only was nothing accomplished, but President Yang himself was also granted permission to resign due to an asthma attack. All teachers and students of the university were shocked by the news, so on the 25th of last month (April), the student unions of the four colleges of Arts, Science, Law, Agriculture, and Engineering jointly established the "Relocation Movement Committee," and all professors offered positive support, sending a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting understanding of the current situation of Yingshi University and relocating it away from Jinhua. Unexpectedly, during this period, Acting President Zhou Shang also resigned from his position as "unable to bear the burden," which left the school in a state of leaderlessness, causing panic among teachers and students. Meetings have been convened everywhere in recent days to discuss the aftermath, and normal classes have been affected as a result. The students all hope that the two issues of the location and the president can be resolved at the same time as soon as possible to avoid escalation of the situation.</p>
<p>It is reported that eight student representatives from various colleges of the university took a car to Hangzhou on the 28th of last month (April), specifically to visit Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education and request a solution to the location and president issues.</p>
<h3>Datia Prepares for School Anniversary</h3>
<p>Chairman Sun Zhesheng Will Return to School to Preside</p>
<p>June 1st of this year is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of Datia University. The school authorities have appointed Wu Haoran, Shao Jialin, Su Xishi, Tao Yuchuan, Han Zhongqi, Song Chengzhi, and Wang Yuanxin as members of the school anniversary preparation committee. It is reported that it has been decided to hold a grand celebration for two days, and the program is arranged as follows: The first day (June 1st), a memorial ceremony will be held in the morning, and the men's and women's dormitories will be open and cleaned. Various halls and the College of Science and Engineering will open or hold exhibitions. In the afternoon, there will be track and field competitions, and in the evening, there will be recreational performances and dramas. On June 2nd, the finals of various ball games will be held in the morning, the Xia Yuting groundbreaking ceremony will be held in the afternoon, a alumni club reunion will be held, and recreational activities will continue. At that time, the chairman of the school board, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, will return to school to preside over the event, and alumni from the Nanjing-Hangzhou area have agreed to return to school to participate in the first school anniversary after the restoration.</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Will Discuss the Issue of Abolishing National Textbooks; The Seven-Organization Joint Office is Worried About Expired Books</h3>
<p>The future of the national textbooks is becoming increasingly bleak. Recently, the new curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools have been revised by the Ministry of Education and are expected to be officially announced before the summer. The national textbooks compiled in accordance with the old standards will soon become obsolete. It is also learned that the National Assembly will hold a general meeting on May 20th, at which the retention or abolition of the national textbooks will be a topic of heated debate. Educational figures generally predict that the Ministry of Education will have to abandon its established opinion of maintaining the national system in accordance with the public opinion of democratic politics. The decree on opening copyrights may be changed as a result, and a textbook review method may be adopted instead. At this time of change in administrative regulations, the publishing industry is hesitant to move forward. It is reported that the Seven-Organization Joint Office is also worried about the expiration of the books. Due to printing delays, there were many books in stock this spring, and the Ministry of Education was requested to purchase all the books in stock in accordance with the previous agreement terms and Minister Zhu's promise to reduce losses. If this matter does not have a satisfactory result, in addition to resorting to law and public opinion, the Seven-Organization Joint Office plans to auction off the books scattered across the country at a low price in advance to avoid excessive temporary losses.</p>

However, Meng Yiliang injured his foot inadvertently in a small soccer game the other day, so it will be difficult for him to play today, so Gao Baozheng was replaced as the central defender. Zhang Qu will be the goalkeeper, and Wu Yan, a pair of iron gates, can be called the most ideal in Shanghai. Zhang Lingen and Afu will serve as the forwards. Baozheng's central defender won unanimous praise for his dead-on ordering of Li Zhaorong last year. He will definitely perform even better today.</p>
<p>Star Island Captain Xu Jingcheng injured his ankle in the last game against the Jews, so the lineup has been slightly changed today, but the strength is still very strong. When he meets Youth-White one day, it is expected that there will be many wonderful scenes.</p>

<h3>Government Continues to Sell Rice; Purchases Limited by Household Registration Certificate</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Talks with Rice Merchants to Suppress Grain Prices</p>
<p>[Our Report] After attending the National Price Conference in Nanjing, Mayor Wu returned to the city and met with reporters yesterday morning, stating: The government has decided to continue ordering 140,000 tons of foreign rice to replenish rice supplies. The price difference between rice in this city and the Wuxi production area has also been set at 20% by the Price Conference. The Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a meeting of county magistrates in Zhenjiang on the 1st to discuss suppressing rice prices in the production area. This move will have a significant impact on this city.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with rice merchant representatives Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Gu Yisheng, Hu Wenan, Zhai Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Hu Hangang, and others at the municipal government. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau also attended. The rice merchant representatives recounted the recent rise in rice prices in the Su-Xi production area, and the difficulty of procurement by the city's grain merchants, which greatly affected the city's grain supply. Although the city government sells 9,000 bags of rice daily, totaling more than 11,000 piculs, many rice shops in the city have no goods to sell. The reasons for this are nothing more than the general public's rush to purchase and store rice, and the profiteering of scalpers. Mayor Wu and Director Wu decided that, starting today, the following temporary restrictions will be placed on the purchase of government-sold rice by citizens of this city:</p>
<p>Regulations for Purchasing Rice with Certificates</p>
<p>(1) Citizens of each district should bring their household registration certificates to purchase rice from rice shops within their district. The rice shop will stamp the date on the back of the household registration certificate and keep a detailed record of the purchasing citizen's district, baojia, and name for verification.</p>
<p>(2) Each person is limited to one dou per purchase. Each household is limited to a maximum of five dou per purchase. Rice can be purchased once every half month with a household registration certificate.</p>
<p>(3) The retail price of white rice is 16,800 yuan per dou, red glutinous rice is 13,200 yuan per dou, Saigon rice is 12,500 yuan per dou, and Siamese rice is 16,800 yuan per dou.</p>
<p>Retail Price of White Rice Limited to 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The rice merchant representatives also stated the difficulties of transportation and requested consideration for their hardships, allowing a wider margin for the price of rice transported to Shanghai by merchants. The mayor instructed that the maximum retail price of white rice sold by merchants themselves should be temporarily limited to 200,000 yuan per picul. The government must sell rice according to the above methods and price limits, and must not adulterate or degrade the quality.</p>
<p>Black Market White Rice Reaches 240,000</p>
<p>Rice prices continue to rise due to the influence of the production area. The black market price of white rice reached 240,000 yuan, and white glutinous rice exceeded 260,000 yuan. Goods are completely unavailable in the Nanshi market, and only 726.5 piculs arrived in the Beishi market. Transactions could not be conducted, and the market quotation list became a blank sheet of paper. The Social Affairs Bureau still sold 9,000 bags of white rice and Siamese glutinous rice.</p>
<p>70,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Arrive</p>
<p>According to news from the Central Trust Bureau: The foreign rice ordered by this bureau from abroad is based on the quota of the International Emergency Food Council and was originally 240,000 tons, of which 30,000 tons were allocated for other uses, totaling 210,000 tons, ordered from Siam, Vietnam, and other places. From January to April of this year, 70,000 tons have already arrived, and 140,000 tons are still awaiting transport. It is decided that all of them will be transported in before the end of June of this year. 70,000 tons will arrive this month, including 30,000 tons of Siamese rice. There will be no problem with the supply of rice in June, July, and August of this year.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Raising Prices Detained for Three Days</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have repeatedly soared, due to the machinations of rice parasites. Therefore, in addition to doing their best to clear the sources and stepping up the sale of rice, the relevant authorities are determined to severely punish illegal rice maggots. In the past week, many cases of illegal rice shops raising prices or hoarding rice have been investigated and dealt with. It is learned that the Yimiao Police Station of this city received a tip from citizens yesterday that the Tongxin Rice Shop at No. 116 Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, was raising rice prices without authorization, selling it at a high price of 190,000 yuan per picul. Furthermore, the Taifeng Rice Shop at No. 77 on the same road was exploiting the poor by charging a retail price of 2,000 yuan per liter, seeking illegal private gain. The police station sent police to investigate and found it to be true, and immediately detained the owners of the two rice shops, detaining them for three days as a warning. The stored rice is monitored by personnel from the police station and sold at the limited price.</p>

Some stocks have risen by 25% in April. The market believes that many companies have developed their business and their real value is above the nominal value of the shares, so they are unanimously bullish on stocks.</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Re-export Issue; Development Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan announced measures to stabilize yarn and cloth market prices and balance supply, the re-export of yarn and cloth in this city has been suspended. The dyeing and weaving and cotton cloth industries have repeatedly submitted requests to the Textile Control Commission, requesting that both production capacity and the difficulties of commercial transport be taken into account. Yesterday morning (May 1st), in addition to telegraphing President Zhang to inform the Textile Control Commission to adopt the opinions of the industry and make comprehensive and proper arrangements, the persons in charge of the two associations also met with Mayor Wu, requesting that he, in his position as concurrently the chairman of the Textile Control Commission, take into consideration the livelihood of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises in this city. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Wu also invited Pan Shihao to discuss the matter, and inquired extensively about the true situation of the market and the re-export situation. He also expressed that he would, within the scope of implementing the central government's policies, accommodate the opinions of the industry associations as much as possible. He agreed to consider the two points of limited quota allocation and reduction, and limited categories. Pan also went to the business office of the Textile Control Commission for a cordial discussion. It is heard that there may be a meeting in the next two days to discuss the matter together. More than 2,000 companies in the dyeing and weaving and cotton cloth industries are currently worried about the seriousness of this issue. However, according to Pan, Mayor Wu will definitely make proper arrangements. The current state of stagnation is expected to return to normal soon.</p>
<h3>Unified Import Management Measures; Temporary Measures in South China Canceled</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Temporary Import Management Committee held its 30th regular meeting on April 29th. Director Mai Zuoheng of the Guangdong District Office came to Shanghai to attend. According to the report, the current status of issuing import permits in the district is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The temporary permits issued by the Guangzhou District Office are generally settled with foreign exchange sold by designated banks. The temporary permits issued by the Kowloon Branch Office and the Gongbei Customs do not settle foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(B) There are 342 registered and qualified importers with Schedule (2), and 551 with Schedule (3) A.</p>
<p>(C) For food and fertilizer, 6,000 Hong Kong dollars may be applied for each time. For building materials and paper, 4,000 Hong Kong dollars may be applied for each time. For goods in Schedule (3) A, each company may apply for a maximum of 2,000 Hong Kong dollars per day.

<p>(D) The import locations for permits issued in Kowloon are Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Jiangmen, Zhanjiang, Beihai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. The permits issued by the Gongbei Customs are limited to the use of the Gongbei Customs only.</p>
<p>The above situation is the temporary measure implemented in South China. Because Hong Kong and Guangdong are separated by water, the situation is special. When the government announced the revised trade measures, in order to avoid a complete standstill of trade, the above temporary measures were taken. Now, after repeated discussions by the Executive Committee, it is believed that the South China region should also be handled in accordance with national measures to ensure uniformity. Director Mai is currently in consultation with the Quota Allocation Department and the Non-Quota Review Department to discuss practical measures. Once the arrangements are in place, the aforementioned temporary measures will be canceled immediately.</p>

It is reported that the highest grade newsprint once reached 190,000 yuan on the 24th and 25th of last month. However, most of it was quoted price, and transactions were rare, so it gradually weakened again from the 26th. People in the industry said: After all, newspapers are different from yarn and cloth, and it is not easy to sell them off when the market is sluggish. The fundamental reasons for this gradual rise are the small domestic production and the small foreign supply. However, the recent reason is actually the stimulation of the general rise in prices.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Still Lacking Improvement</h3>
<p>The foreign-owned tea market, which has been weak for a long time, still felt unable to recover yesterday. The reason is that buyers continue to stand by and watch, and people's hearts are difficult to stir up. Various domestic sales teas are still inquired about by people in this street and nearby villages, and the market is still not deserted. However, as colleagues do prices with each other, the prices in and out are similar, so there is little difference. The 35th year's Bai Lin black tea, which has dried up its inventory, is about to run out after the Yingkou merchants suddenly became active in purchasing. Therefore, although there is still demand in that area, transactions have stopped.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Tuberculosis Prevention</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>In the realm of modern medicine, there remain three major ailments for which there are no fundamental cures: (1) leprosy, (2) cancer, and (3) tuberculosis. Thus, these three illnesses are universally recognized as formidable adversaries to human health and life. Among them, tuberculosis is particularly widespread and deeply rooted in its harmful effects. This is because the opportunities for transmission are exceptionally numerous, and in terms of treatment, not only are there no definitive solutions, causing doctors to shake their heads and frown, but also, dealing with this disease has a close relationship with an individual’s profession and finances. There are countless instances of tuberculosis patients missing the opportunity for treatment due to professional constraints and economic pressures.</p>
<p>Because of the various difficulties in treating tuberculosis, everyone is paying attention to and emphasizing "prevention." Originally, the value of "prevention" in modern medicine is universally acknowledged, and it is especially significant for tuberculosis. Everyone knows the harm that tuberculosis causes to humans, but it is not impossible to reduce its harm and scope through human preventive measures. We see that in European and American countries, tuberculosis and various similar infectious diseases are gradually decreasing! This is due to the progress of their science, the development of sanitation, and the effectiveness of diligent prevention efforts. Looking back at our China, all diseases—especially infectious diseases like tuberculosis—seem to be spreading and rampant everywhere; the reasons are certainly complex, but the main reasons are nothing more than the backwardness of science, the immaturity of sanitation, and the lack of attention and effort in prevention work. Alas, looking at others and looking at ourselves, we truly feel ashamed and even more heartbroken!</p>
<p>Now that we know that the effectiveness of "prevention" is so important in the rise and fall of tuberculosis, how should we pay attention to and emphasize this crucial tuberculosis prevention work?</p>
<p>Since the importance of tuberculosis prevention is as described above, what is the meaning of its work? The meaning of its work can be summarized into two points:</p>
<p>(1) For healthy individuals who have not contracted the disease, find ways to prevent transmission and avoid becoming ill.</p>
<p>(2) For patients who have already contracted the disease, find ways to prevent mild cases from becoming severe and severe cases from becoming critical; at the same time, find ways to prevent them from infecting healthy people.</p>
<p>How can we make this crucial tuberculosis prevention work effective? The first is "publicity work." So-called publicity means awakening the general public's attention to and understanding of tuberculosis; making them aware of the dangers of tuberculosis and understand the importance of "tuberculosis prevention."</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is extremely prevalent in China, spreading everywhere, which is an undeniable fact. The reason why it has become so widespread and allowed to spread so rampantly is due to the people's lack of hygiene, which is also well known. But if we ask why the people do not practice hygiene, in other words, what is the reason why they do not practice hygiene? We must say that it is because of the people's lack of knowledge—especially the lack of hygiene knowledge! Because of the lack of hygiene knowledge, they cannot understand that practicing hygiene can improve health, avoid disease, and prolong life; and that unhygienic practices can harm health, attract disease, and shorten life. Because of the lack of hygiene knowledge, they do not know that sputum often contains many tuberculosis bacteria that can kill. They know to avoid being killed by a knife, but they do not realize that sputum can kill. The fundamental reason is still because they do not know that a knife can kill, and sputum can also kill, right?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say: to make this tuberculosis prevention work effective, the first step is publicity. Whether it is direct lectures, oral publicity, or indirect written publicity, all can exert the publicity effect of tuberculosis prevention and achieve the working effect of tuberculosis prevention. We should come up with various methods to spread all kinds of knowledge about tuberculosis to the public, either with pleasant language or with popular and vivid writing, so that they understand the dangers of tuberculosis and know the importance of tuberculosis prevention. For example, if they thoroughly understand that sputum can transmit tuberculosis, how difficult it is to cure tuberculosis, and how it endangers life, they will gradually change the bad habit of spitting everywhere. They know how tuberculosis is transmitted, so they will pay attention to the implementation of prevention in peacetime before getting sick. Knowing that tuberculosis patients have difficulty in curing, especially the hopelessness of late-stage treatment, they will pay attention to early medical treatment. This is the highest goal of tuberculosis prevention. If tuberculosis prevention work can achieve this stage, it will be a great success of "tuberculosis prevention"!</p>
<h3>Suggestions on the Chinese Naming of BCG</h3>
<p>— Liu Yongchun</p>
<p>BCG was first used for human inoculation in France in 1921. Seven years later (in the 17th year of the Republic of China), the Health Construction Commission of the Nanjing National Government proposed manufacturing this vaccine to prevent tuberculosis. Although there have been occasional famous figures in the medical field, such as Mr. Song Guobin, who have continued to respond, it has not yet attracted the attention of the Chinese people. Now that scholars from various countries have proven its excellent results, the Chinese medical community has also praised BCG; and the health authorities are planning to promote it on a large scale, which is truly good news for tuberculosis prevention and is gratifying! The author believes that since this vaccine will be widely used, its Chinese naming must be standardized. The matter of translation is extremely difficult; it can be translated phonetically, semantically, or both. My humble opinion is that directly calling BCG "Tuberculosis Prevention Vaccine" is too broad. Perhaps it can be named "Bixi Liao" by translating both phonetically and semantically; however, the drawback is that it sounds like a proprietary medicine. Is this appropriate? I hope my colleagues can provide further guidance.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the New Chinese Medicine (End)</h3>
<p>— Hong Guanzhi</p>
<p>For example, the phenomenon of nerve reflexes and the reaction of blood cell agglutination are both manifestations of "matter." If we do not understand the principles of all "reflexes" and "agglutination" first, we will naturally think that this phenomenon is a mysterious life force, a supra-material thing. Therefore, even the action of bacteria is regarded as supra-material and attributed to the Six Evils, resulting in nonsensical talk loaded with ghosts. Even now, we still cling to dead bones and feel complacent, which is truly lamentable! Looking at his article, he also quoted a passage from the Japanese Kojima Sakai, saying: "No one can guarantee that medical laws are absolutely correct. Even Newton's laws of mechanics have been modified by Einstein's theory of relativity. Medical laws are no exception and must be thoroughly examined." Then, Mr. Mou made a grand statement, saying: "Since all the theorems and creeds of today cannot be fully believed, the only thing we can rely on is the facts of experience. Therefore, today's Chinese medicine should not blindly agree with Western medicine and be done with it, just because it is a valuable fact. We must know that the theories of Western medicine are constantly progressing and being revised. Can we also follow along every day and be a backward old doctor for the rest of our lives?" Haha! I think Mr. Mou's statement is really stubborn to the point of being astonishing. It turns out that Mr. Mou wants Chinese medicine to always stay in one place and not progress, or that knowledge that is "constantly progressing and being revised" is not worthy of our imitation. Therefore, we have to find a new path and can only seek from the experience of the dead. This path is indeed a good place to go and can lead to a good ending. (To be honest, it is a dead end.) The treatment records of Chinese medicine are not worthy of being called "empirical." I have already said this in the previous article, and in the literature of Chinese medicine, no matter how great your ability, it is impossible to dig out valuable treasures. I do not know how many people have tried this work, and the result is nothing. It used to be said: "Looking at it for seven days, chaos remains the same," it is just wasting effort. Digging and digging can only dig out a pile of skulls (contradictions and unreliable results). Other than that, there is nothing at all. Mr. Mou said that the method of communication in Mr. Ye Juchuan's "Collection of National Medicine Prescriptions" is not good. Although this method is not a proper solution and does not contribute much to the unification of Chinese and Western medicine, his thinking is always correct. He wants to unite Chinese and Western medicine, to put Chinese medicine on the track of science, not to separate and confront Chinese and Western medicine. So no matter what the outcome, their starting point is always correct. Unlike Mr. Mou, who harbors an ambition to find ways to make "Chinese medicine" permanently independent and immortal, and to add a "scientific" coat borrowed from a corpse to decorate and be done with it! In addition, Mr. Mou also cited many examples of "absorbing foreign culture, integrating it, and forming its own system" to show that Chinese culture has the ability of "broad and profound digestion." He should know that the exchange and integration of foreign culture is also limited to a certain part. Its ideological nature must be similar and in the same era to be possible. If you want to crossbreed the "empty" "metaphysical theory" with the "empirical" "science" to produce a good new species, it is an impossible thing, as ridiculous as an ordinary person dreaming of marrying a goddess of the ninth heaven. With such an unreasonable person, also talking about "science" and "historical process," how can it not be chilling? I really did not expect that people in the Chinese medicine community who advocated the integration of Chinese and Western medicine never dared to do or say what they are saying now; now there is this strange person who makes this delusional thought to play this trick. I do not know what the advanced or junior members of the Chinese medicine community think of it? The so-called "on the one hand, firmly grasp one's own inherent theories, and on the other hand, absorb and integrate foreign scientific knowledge," "we oppose passive and blind Westernization. We should automatically rise up and absorb foreign scientific knowledge." I really do not understand this. Mr. Mou does not want "Westernization," but wants to absorb and integrate foreign "scientific knowledge." What exactly is going on? Since you do not recognize Western medical knowledge that is constantly progressing, and you want to oppose it, what else is there that is truly foreign "scientific knowledge?" Do you know that all "foreign scientific knowledge" is also "constantly progressing and being revised?" In my opinion, it is better for you not to absorb it, otherwise you will inevitably "be a backward old doctor for the rest of your life"! There are thousands of layers of obstacles and boundless evil seas. Turning back is the shore. Think deeply and wake up!</p>
<p>There is also the most wonderful paragraph in Mr. Mou's article, which is also his masterpiece. He said: "Because all the tissues of the human body are interconnected by blood vessels and nerves, there is absolutely no truly local disease. All local lesions affect the whole body." I am afraid that not only scientists will laugh at you for not understanding things, but even Chinese medicine practitioners - not just Chinese medicine practitioners, even rural women and children, will say that you do not understand medicine and laugh your teeth out. The so-called "absolutely no truly local disease," I really do not know how you can say such a bold statement. In Chinese medicine books, you can never find a "scripture" that says that all diseases belong to the whole body. Lung abscesses and intestinal abscesses are only called lung abscesses and intestinal abscesses. They are not confused with "five internal organs and six intestines," nor are the diseased parts expanded and directly called "human abscesses," because these are all local lesions and cannot be exaggerated. In addition, although the more abstract diseases are not as precisely analyzed as Western medicine, they are all specific to their location. Headaches are called headaches, and rib pain and back pain are also called rib pain and back pain. They are not called whole body pain to distinguish them from true whole body pain. However, Mr. Mou always likes to argue forcefully, and this is how he gets to the point of distorting right and wrong. Is it not heartbreaking! Such "Chinese medicine," such "science," is this the so-called modern "Eastern culture"? Alas, I want to say nothing.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The current Chinese medicine camp can be said to be extremely chaotic. Those who are a little smarter are secretly using Western medicine and falsely claiming secret recipes. In fact, they have gradually changed in nature. To put it bluntly, it is plagiarism of new methods. However, there is no denying the fact that it is equivalent to surrender. There is another group of people who only use stethoscopes and thermometers to decorate their storefronts, which is completely a disguised advertisement. They should be discussed separately. In recent years, what we can especially see in society, especially in the inland, is that there are a small number of unlicensed Western doctors who were originally stopped by the health authorities due to changes in the rules, and the issue of examination and inquiry has not been resolved rationally to this day. Among them, some have joined the Chinese medicine camp in order to obtain legal status and then carry out their Western medical business. In fact, they do not fully understand Chinese medicine, and sometimes they even stand up and praise Chinese medicine. Is it not laughable and pitiful? However, the "orthodox" school of Chinese medicine is deeply rooted and still has the belief of the majority of people. You think that a specialized free profession can actually be stirred up to this point, and they are still singing high the praises of "preserving Chinese medicine." It is simply like sleepwalking. We know that improving Chinese medicine is definitely not a matter of plagiarizing new methods and applying Western medicine. We must start from the academic foundation, and all ideas of valuing the ancient and belittling the present must be fundamentally eliminated. Otherwise, even if we can accept the achievements of science on the surface, it is still a self-deceiving act. Recently, some self-proclaimed new Chinese medicine practitioners think that this is the scientificization of Chinese medicine. This makes people who are fascinated by science but do not have a sufficient understanding of medicine sometimes fall for their tricks. In fact, it is as superficial as writing a few new medical terms on a child's writing board, as I said in the previous article. After saying it all, it is still not enough, because they have not accepted the basic theories of new medicine at all!</p>
<p>Western medicine is a "scientific" product. Other than that, of course, there cannot be another "scientific medicine." The so-called scientific medicine is Western medicine, which is very clear. But what we mean by "scientificization of Chinese medicine" refers to the "people" who are professional Chinese medicine practitioners, not the "theory" of Chinese medicine, nor the "literature" of Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine literature should be organized by historical methods and studied by scientific methods. As for the methods of organization and research, it should be discussed in a separate article. Chinese medicine theory is a "metaphysical theory" and cannot be scientificized. Our hope is that Chinese medicine practitioners will also learn Western medicine, because Western medicine is also medicine. This is what most Chinese medicine practitioners do not deny, and the scientificization of Chinese medicine is also enthusiastically advocated by most enlightened members of the Chinese medicine community. What needs to be said here is that, in order to avoid lengthy text, it is limited to the method of "scientificization." In other words: the way out for "new Chinese medicine practitioners" in the future. I think it is always a good thing for a person to have dual knowledge. I guess no one would object to that, right? To put it bluntly, the path of scientificization of Chinese medicine in the future is really only to gradually move towards full Westernization and use Chinese medicine as one way. All the basic clinical knowledge of scientific medicine should be fully accepted. Only in this way can it be called true scientificization and have a new way out. As for the valuable part of the old experience of Chinese medicine, it can still be preserved and promoted, because if we value knowledge and prepare it in one person, then integrating it will not be difficult. As long as the new Chinese medicine practitioners have the courage and determination to fully accept scientific medicine, the future will naturally be bright. This attitude of only asking about medicine and not asking about Chinese or Western medicine is the most necessary. Do not have a psychology of self-importance, cling to the old and remain unchanged, and do not seek progress; or even want to make Chinese medicine permanently independent and exist forever in the world. This kind of thinking that violates the general rules of historical evolution will only lead to self-destruction. To put it bluntly, not only is there no treasure to be unearthed in Chinese medicine theory, but there is also no other way to improve Chinese medicine except for full scientificization. All the methods of improvement have been done by predecessors, and no matter what, they have all failed. This is an undeniable fact. Do not repeat the mistakes of the past, and please sit down and think deeply, and do not have any more delusions! If you do not believe me, you might as well wait and see the consequences!</p>
<p>Finally, I must repeat again that there are indeed many Chinese medicine practitioners who have already embraced science and are willing to turn around and seek a way out. We must give them a chance to turn around and point out a correct way out so that their hard work will not be buried, which is also very important. Those who advocate medical revolution always criticize Chinese medicine for not working. When some Chinese medicine practitioners have already realized this and want to seek a way out, the result is that they have no way to enter. Some health authorities sometimes want to ban them and not allow them to approach scientific isolation, which is also disappointing. Therefore, the establishment of scientific training institutions for Chinese medicine is absolutely necessary. I hope that in the future, the health authorities and people in the Western medical community will open the door of kindness and pay attention to support! (March 1, 1947, in Shanghai)</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Rabies</h3>
<p>— Chen Jindou</p>
<p>On March 28th, the "China-America Evening News" had a medical journal edited by the Chinese medical community, which contained an article entitled "Discussion on Rabies." One passage in the article was a description of Chinese medicine confessing its mistakes: "The treatment of rabies by doctors can be said to be mostly speculation, with no accurate basis or certainty. They only use prescription secret medicines to forcibly act recklessly, regardless of life or death, and use strong medicines such as wind-drying, purgative, and blood-breaking… cutting off people's vitality… If people with weak constitutions have no poison, they will inevitably develop other diseases instead. Everyone who takes these prescriptions, whether they have poison or not, will inevitably see blood in their urine, have abdominal pain like a knife, and have black diarrhea, treating human life as a child's play and human organs as a battlefield base." It also said: "Poison is also a kind of gasification, which is not rare and not very terrible." The author's knowledge is shallow, and I have no specialized research on infectious diseases, but after reading this article, I am frightened and dare to make a public and popular introduction to the common knowledge about rabies.</p>
<p>Rabies originally occurs in animals such as dogs, wolves, foxes, cats, cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep; the term rabies, according to the meaning of its Greek original Lyssa, means a state of frenzy and spasm, so it is named after the pathological symptoms. If a person contracts this disease, the vast majority are directly due to being bitten or licked on exposed wounds by an already diseased rabid dog, so the virus in its saliva can enter the human body through contact with the wound. This virus is currently also called a filterable virus (FiltrierbarcsVirus). After the virus enters through the wound, it travels along the local nerves directly to the brain and spinal cord system; in other words, it uses the peripheral nerves as a pathway to introduce it into the central nerve, and then the structure of the nerve ganglion cells in the brain and other parts is destroyed, and the function changes, and various symptoms appear. Because dogs are the most common and have more opportunities for contact among diseased animals, this disease is generally called rabies (also called hydrophobia).</p>
<p>Whether human or animal, after suffering from this disease, there must be symptoms such as neurological disorders and muscle cramps. Every time they see water, or even want to drink water, the muscles of the pharynx and respiratory tract will have a sudden spasm, which leads to difficulty breathing and suffocation and death. Therefore, patients with this disease have great fear of water, so the name hydrophobia is also considered a pseudonym for this disease. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Strolling in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>Bamboo Clapper Ballads and Miscellaneous Arts</p>
<p>The "Bamboo Clapper Ballads" of Jia, the Blind Man, are said to be a famous art form in Chengdu. I was twice dragged by friends to appreciate this art. The name "Bamboo Clapper Ballads" sounded new to me, but I didn't know what kind of musical instrument it was. Later, I learned that it was the "fish drum" and "bamboo clapper" used in singing "Taoist Ballads" in the past, exactly the things held by "Zhang Guolao," one of the Eight Immortals in paintings. People in Chengdu call it the Bamboo Clapper Ballads.</p>
<p>A small attic in a teahouse was partitioned into a small tea room, which could accommodate dozens of small tea seats. In the middle was a small stage, like a small podium in a school. On the podium, a glass sign resembling a small archway was erected, reading "Jia Shusan." That was the scene of the place. Most of the people who come here are refined people who love to listen to Bamboo Clapper Ballads, so they all sit politely and there is no noise. With a loud shout from the waiter, Jia Shusan appeared on stage. He was a blind man wearing dark crystal glasses, a top hat, a gray silk robe, and a black vest, holding the bamboo clapper ballads. After sitting for a while, wiping his face, and drinking tea, he quietly played the bamboo clapper ballads and sang.</p>
<p>This seems to be a distinguished form of singing. He only sings two selections each time, with a five-minute intermission in between, taking up an hour of the audience's time. In terms of the lyrics, his words are quite popular and elegant, but the soft tone reminds me of the storytelling songs that used to be popular in my hometown. The lyrics sung in Wu dialect with a three-stringed instrument have the same feeling as this tone. In people's thoughts and emotions, I feel that Chengdu friends have something in common with Suzhou people: eating snacks, sitting in teahouses, telling witty jokes, and putting on a pretentious front. It is fitting that they appreciate such soft and decadent music. This is created by a superficial culture. Historically, due to inconvenient transportation, it is fitting that Sichuanese people have a strong sense of conservatism. Therefore, even the talented and intelligent are limited to a few literary figures. Apart from Sima Xiangru, Su Dongpo, Li Taibai, Yang Xiong, and a few modern literati, it seems that no earth-shattering figures have emerged. These few friends have tasted the bitterness of displacement, but the people of their hometown have boundless admiration and worship for them. Therefore, the style of valuing literature is no less than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but the richness of cultural relics is far inferior to that of Wu and Yan. Since the transportation line is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, it is only natural that all its customs become a dependency of the former "Su-Chang." When people come to Chengdu, they have the feeling of arriving in the "Chinese Concession" of Shanghai in the past, probably for this reason.</p>
<p>In addition to Bamboo Clapper Ballads, there is the so-called "Yangqin" entertainment, also in a teahouse. It is an ensemble using drums, huqin, and a musical instrument originating in Guangdong, with a few copper wires stretched on a wooden board and beaten with two bamboo pieces. There is more than one singer, with roles of male, female, painted face, and clown. Because it is more complex, it tends to make people feel more energetic when listening to it. The singer playing the young female role also wears a pair of dark glasses and sings in a cat-like voice, which is a bit flirtatious. The reason for wearing dark glasses is probably because she feels embarrassed. There are more listeners here, and some rush over, whispering in agreement. Finally, there are people who applaud loudly. I really envy my Sichuan friends for having such good leisure and spare time.</p>
<p>Chengdu only has one Peking Opera theater, performing Peking Opera in the Shanghai style. The actors are not so much selling their art as selling their charm. There are many local operas, which are "Sichuan Opera." I think the Sichuan Opera performers still sing according to their traditions, properly and respectfully. They don't "mess around" too much. "Jia Peizhi" is a leader among Sichuan Opera actors. He is a famous red-faced male role. I went to see his Guan Yu specifically. Sichuan Opera is completely the same as all old Chinese operas in terms of movements, but the singing is low and soft, with many low and high-pitched voices. The melody lacks variation and uses several single tones, repeatedly revolving, and finally slightly dragging the sound. The instruments and spoken lines often separate, and only add accompaniment at the end of the singing. Different tunes are used to supplement the pauses in the spoken lines. After a particularly passionate singing line, the people backstage join in the chorus. In the history of drama, this can be said to be an ancient singing method.</p>
<p>Wuhou Temple</p>
<p>The "Wuhou Temple," described by Du Fu in his poem, "Where to find the Prime Minister's Shrine? Outside Jin Guan City, the cypresses are lush," is located outside the South Gate of Chengdu, less than a few miles away. On the right side of the avenue, a large courtyard and two halls are hidden among the towering green cypresses. These cypresses have been praised by the Tang people, and one can imagine their antiquity. The towering halls and walls must have been repaired by countless people. The general public calls it "Wuhou Temple," but the plaque "Zhaolie Temple" hangs high at the entrance. However, the hall of the late emperor is in front, and the hall of Zhuge Liang is in the back, which is a case of the guest overshadowing the host. Looking at the architecture of the front and back halls, one is solemn and complex, and the other is simple and unadorned. It can be seen that later generations have a special affection for the Prime Minister. As for why the hall of the First Emperor must be in front of the Prime Minister's Hall, and the entrance is marked as Zhaolie Temple, it probably expresses the meaning of "a subject does not insult his ruler." Since the Prime Minister is qualified to build a shrine, the First Emperor should also put on a show. The Prime Minister, who was entrusted with the heavy responsibility of entrusting the orphan and exhausted himself to death, repaid the kindness of his mentor with a sincere heart. This design was retained on his behalf. However, I always feel that Zhuge Liang suffered a great injustice. This extremely smart fool who was deceived until his death is indeed a tragic figure. Zhuge Liang really had no need to confront Cao Cao. As for wanting to repeat the "desert land," he could just paste a bigger map at home and write some nice-sounding words on it. Why not just be a self-sufficient farmer in Nanyang and work for others?</p>
<p>But Wuhou Temple is really a quiet place. I like to sit in the water pavilion on the right side of the hall, drink tea, look at the towering ancient cypresses and the layered halls, and listen to the strange calls of the eagles on the treetops. Looking around at the front of the temple, which has been turned into a school where naughty children are playing basketball, and some old monks and tea drinkers, I feel that this place has also become a place that is both ancient and modern.</p>
<p>Bibamen Alley</p>
<p>There is the Xue Tao Well in the so-called "Bibamen Alley," on the bank of the Jin River outside the East Gate, near a certain university. It is said that the water in this well was once used by Xue Tao, one of the famous courtesans in history, to wash paper. Therefore, the well is named after the person, and people think of the person when they look at the well. To visit Xue Tao Well, one can pass through a willow embankment. Behind the rows of willows, on the outskirts, stand neat, half-Chinese and half-Western-style houses of the university. Pairs of young men and women stroll or read books on the outskirts and the willow embankment, but it seems that there are more people whispering side by side and fewer people studying seriously. Xue Tao Well has become a park. There are stalls at the entrance, and tea seats inside. Some young people who like to read sit here, sipping tea and reading magazines and newspapers. The sky-covering green bamboo, evergreen in winter and summer, washes away the dust that has been brought from the city all year round.</p>
<p>Reading Xue Tao's short biography and looking at the stone-carved image of Xue Tao on the inkstone, one can recall Xue Tao's life. She followed her father, who was an official traveling around, to this place. After her father died and she was stranded in a foreign land, she had to come out to serve wine in order to support her mother. Fortunately, she was able to write poetry and gained the sympathy of literati, so she did not become a minor star but a "proofreader." The suffering in her heart was a hundred times greater than that of today's socialites. After her beauty faded, she dressed as a Taoist, turned away friends and guests, and lived alone in a small building, spending her twilight years. One can also imagine her tragic life and inner loneliness.</p>
<p>"Wangjiang Tower" is also here, but I didn't want to climb the tower and look at the river, because I have experienced crossing mountains and ridges and crossing oceans. Climbing a restaurant-style not-so-high tower and looking at a not-so-wide river that looks like a small stream is really not satisfying. The beauty of Sichuan is entirely in the mountains outside the city. I have had no connection with these places where a group of people sit in a small park, drink tea, leisurely read other people's poems and essays, and talk nonsense about world changes for many years, because it is really too elegantly vulgar, too quietly noisy, too peacefully verbose, and too comfortably boring.</p>
<p>Qingyang Palace</p>
<p>"Qingyang Palace" is outside the South Gate, almost in the countryside. It is a Taoist temple on the edge of the city. Here, a flower fair is held every spring. Various exotic flowers are sent from all over the countryside to compete here. It is a lively gathering. As I see it, it can be said that China originally had no religion. After the Han and Tang dynasties, Taoism was a religion created by the Chinese themselves. However, it is far less powerful than Buddhism, which came from foreign lands, because Taoism really has no consistent theory, and its claims are entirely mythological, so it can only deceive fools and women. To the average person, Buddhism also seems to be advocating superstition, but because it has many classics, no matter what sect it is, the main thing is to promote personal cultivation and to achieve altruism as the ultimate goal. So it seems to be a passive attitude, but it is actually applicable to any aspect, and can harmonize every individual and the masses, and not raise selfish thoughts. Therefore, although it has been slandered by some corrupt scholars, it has been promoted by many true intellectuals and occupies the first place in Eastern religions. I have traveled to many places over the years and know that Taoism is not as powerful as Buddhism, especially in the south, where Taoism is even more declining than Buddhism. This is because since the Jin and Southern Dynasties, the nation moved south, and Buddhism also multiplied to the Yangtze River basin along with political power. Therefore, although this Qingyang Palace is a large temple, it can really be said to be quite old. The front of the temple has been used as a military and police agency. What preserves the atmosphere of religion and art is only a large hall in the back and a Bagua Pavilion in the abandoned garden. Because the past architecture was quite exquisite, it still retains its beauty and majesty to this day. But the name Qingyang really doesn't know what it's based on. The main deity in the main hall is Lao Jun. The two bronze sheep on the left and right are incomparably beautiful art treasures. The bronze models, the same size as real sheep, have been smoothed by people over the years and are really cute. They are really two good antiques. For these two bronze sheep, I lingered in the temple for a long time, and I didn't feel bored. It was much better than sitting in a restaurant drinking dishes.</p>
<p>On the side of the main hall, there is a courtyard, which is the dormitory of the Taoist priests. The paper windows and wooden walls are so simple that they are almost like they were from the Ming Dynasty. I think it would be very comfortable to live here, read books, and write. However, this happiness has already been taken by the Taoist priests here. No matter where I go, I am always unfortunately in the city, which is really hateful.</p>
<p>Seven Killing Stele</p>
<p>The "Seven Killing Stele," a relic of the roving bandit Zhang Xianzhong at the end of the Ming Dynasty, is inscribed with "Heaven produces all things to nourish man, but man has no virtue to repay Heaven. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill," at "Thatched Cottage Temple." Browsing through Qing Dynasty anecdotal novels, there are many records of Zhang Xianzhong's story; it is said that he was so cruel that he cut off women's small feet and piled them up like mountains, which shows how many people he killed. Thinking of the historical tragedies and seeing the current situation, I am really extremely terrified.</p>
<h3>Crying for Fu Tienian</h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<p>Hengyang shakes with talented scholars, lives in humility with emptiness,</p>
<p>carves words to explain profound meanings, presents vitality to display brilliant words.</p>
<p>Our acquaintance has lasted over twenty years, he was always at my side, older than me by five years;</p>
<p>knocking the bowl to thank the butterfly, flying the brush to create rice-grain tigers;</p>
<p>painting is exceptionally outstanding, as are the bitter gourd and Tianchi;</p>
<p>the three perfections are commonly praised, his strong integrity is rarely known in the world.</p>
<p>For eight years, he lived in solitude, upholding virtue and chanting Mingyi,</p>
<p>how could he be buried after the recovery, a slave to the court, bitterly suffering?</p>
<p>Heaven's heart has not tired of disaster, not sparing an old man to leave behind;</p>
<p>in chaotic times, writing is cheapened, how can I bear to read his posthumous poems (you once sent me a poem, with the line "in chaotic times, writing is cheapened")!</p>
<p>Old friends are withering away day by day, I am not crying for my personal loss.</p>
<h3>Sea Fever by John Masefield – Translated by Zhenqin</h3>
<p>I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,</p>
<p>And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,</p>
<p>And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,</p>
<p>And a grey mist on the sea's face and a grey dawn breaking.</p>
<p>I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide</p>
<p>Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;</p>
<p>And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,</p>
<p>And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.</p>
<p>I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,</p>
<p>To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife;</p>
<p>And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,</p>
<p>And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.</p>
<p>[John Masefield was a poet laureate. He lost his parents at a young age and wandered around, working as a cook, carpet worker, waiter, and sailor. One evening, he accidentally read the poems of Chaucer, a great English poet of the 13th century, and decided to become a poet. His masterpieces are the long poems "Everlasting Mercy", "Dauber", "The Daffodil Fields" and "The Widow in the Bye Street". His early wandering life is reflected in the collection of short poems "Salt-Water Ballads", from which "Sea Fever" is translated, which is one of the author's most outstanding short poems, and is included in almost every modern European and American poetry anthology. - Translator]</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 500</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In addition, there is a legendary saying that the Korean comrades who stayed in Shanghai at that time, in order to avoid the Japanese invaders' lewdness and abuse, many young female patriots were dressed as men, which also facilitated their work. Perhaps this Korean representative who met with Tsurumi was one of the women disguised as men?</p>
<p>In short, regardless of whether this Korean patriot is male or female, I cannot escape the guilt of negligence for omitting the person's name. I sincerely apologize to this comrade with a thousand apologies, and wish him or her eternal peace in heaven! In addition, I also pray for these Korean patriots, and hope that the blood they shed for their motherland can be transformed into a solid and glorious cornerstone, laying the foundation for the eternal prosperity of Korea!</p>
<p>Special No. 2, Li Ming, (during the fall of Shanghai, he was in charge of the mobile secret intelligence radio, but unfortunately, he was captured by the enemy's special agents on the eve of the Japanese surrender in July 1945 and sacrificed heroically - the author pays sincere respect!) He came from a military background; although he was only about thirty years old, he had a full beard; his eyes were sharp, shining with cold light, yet his language was gentle and his thoughts were delicate; so he was ordered by his superiors to take on this delicate and risky work.</p>
<p>(Normally, in general society, if three or five young people like this gathered in a room in this kind of inn, we could easily guess the wonderful programs they had for "entertainment": if they weren't impatiently playing a sixteen-round "anything goes" mahjong game, it would definitely be "sand crab"; if not, it would definitely be Russian dominoes. At the same time, they would definitely bring out each other's "dear friends," whether picked from the dance hall, caught at the movie theater, or discovered by the guide company for no reason, etc., etc., like competing for treasures at Lintong, they would boast and boast about each other's gains.</p>
<p>If you accidentally stepped into this room at this time, I can guarantee that the first thing you would notice is a room full of smoke, and the light laughter and scolding would fill your ears. If you grabbed a handful of the air in this room and put it in a bottle, and asked a biochemist to analyze it, I think that in addition to the obvious smells of smoke, alcohol, farts, sweat, and flesh, it probably also contains all kinds of toxins and bacteria.</p>
<p>I think that if the authorities suddenly came up with such a tyranny, and, according to what was said above, made such a few rooms in the same style, and wrote outside the door, "There are all kinds of odors, all kinds of toxins and bacteria inside, and every citizen must pay a certain amount of money to 'entertain' inside for two to eight hours," do you think you would feel resentful towards this authority? I think that if this really happened, undoubtedly, all parties and factions, non-party factions, and even Ying Xiaoliuzi included, would have to rise up against this harsh government; in addition to spreading leaflets and speeches, they would move to marches and demonstrations, wouldn't they?)</p>
<p>At this time, Tsurumi Shouichi and the other four were all preoccupied, eating and drinking a little, and at the same time concentrating their thoughts to discuss the secret of "0915," each with his own guesses and each with his own opinions, but none with a definite conclusion.</p>
<p>Not long after they discussed, the hotel waiter suddenly called up, saying that a Japanese soldier had specifically asked to speak to a certain Yamamoto Masa iwa. It turned out that this person was the car driver that Masa iwa had asked to come to inquire about. At this time, he was wearing a private first class army uniform, neatly dressed, as if he was coming to attend a banquet. Tsurumi didn't look down on him either. After Tsurumi explained his identity, he immediately politely asked him to sit down and drink wine. The guy twisted and turned for a while, and then confessed his guilt severely before he was willing to sit down.</p>
<h3>Snow Clearing After the River and Sky</h3>
<p>— Gong Banqian</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Gift</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>Washington Central News Agency, 26th: President Truman issued an executive order today, ordering Navy Secretary Forrestal to transfer 271 surplus US Navy ships and their necessary floating docks to our country without any cost. After reading this, I can't help but be flattered. This is the honest truth, just like a friend gave me a pair of exquisite rice bowls, which have been put aside and never used, because people are not in pairs, how can you break up the rice bowls? It's better not to use them and treat them as collectibles. Although I have inevitably failed my friend's good intentions, I have no other choice. The United States gave me 271 naval ships, how can we let empty ships come and go? I said I was flattered, and that was the honest truth.</p>
<p>Reading the content of the President's order in detail, it said: "These ships and floating docks should be repaired, equipped, and allocated to China for use, and China should pay for the various materials required for maintenance in cash." Under the circumstances of living on borrowed money, how can "this expense" be raised?</p>
<p>But when people give gifts, they always have to reward the messengers who carry the gifts. This is "human nature," who doesn't understand? So, if people really give us a large number of ships, how can we be embarrassed to ask the giver to bear the cost of repairs and other materials? Of course, we have to pay for it out of our own pockets!</p>
<p>Let's put these questions aside. In any case, the implementation of this order is still subject to Secretary of State Marshall's "final decision," and there is still a considerable amount of time before the "formal transfer." Taking advantage of this time, how do we complete the preparatory work for receiving? We still have to put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>People care about us and hope that we can stand up in East Asia. We should sweep away the past habits and use this opportunity to embark on the road to revival.</p>
<h3>"Counter Lions"</h3>
<p>— Li Quan</p>
<p>Prices are rising without limit, and the salaries of employees are stuck in their original positions. Even if they cannot live with the burden of their wives, children, and parents, how dare they ask the employers for a raise? Let the union negotiate with the employers, but they must come forward themselves. Moreover, the task of the union is to mediate, and it is difficult to conceal the names of the applicants from the employers; therefore, even if the salaries can be adjusted as a result, their jobs are bound to be seriously threatened.</p>
<p>If it could be: (1) Compulsory membership of employees, which can be requested from the police station for execution, and if the execution fails, the police station will send it to the court for sanctions. (2) The employer shall not employ non-members of the industry union, otherwise the union may request the court to adjudicate. (3) The treatment of employees in various industries should be stipulated in detail in the labor-capital agreement concluded by the industry association and the union. (4) When the labor-capital agreement is violated, the association or union of the injured party does not need to apply for handling, and may automatically investigate and negotiate at any time, or request the court to adjudicate. Then the labor movement will have a solid position, and the employees will get reasonable protection.</p>
<p>However, the above hope is a "what if" dream. Therefore, the suffering of the labor movement cannot be eliminated at present; that is, the sorrow of the employees has not yet reached the time of relief. This group, known as "counter lions," is also a cell in the life of the country and a powerful link in the social organization. They are kind and law-abiding people, but they are abandoned by everyone. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Fat Shadow</h3>

<h3>Rest in Peace</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>

<h3>Shanghai Radio's Broadcasting Programs</h3>
<p>— Chengwen</p>
<p>As of now, there are about 30 radio stations in Shanghai, including privately owned, publicly owned, and state-owned radio stations. In terms of quantity, it can be said that there are many, but in terms of quality, it is pitifully poor.</p>
<p>The broadcasting industry in Shanghai has also had more than 20 years of history, but until now, not only has there been no necessary progress, but it has deteriorated, which is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Looking at the world, it has already progressed to the use of electrified education. And what about us? We are still broadcasting all day long obscene, boring, and sexually suggestive jazz songs and popular ditties, and outdated old opera records, etc. Or some low-level, meaningless storytelling songs, Shanghai opera, Shaoxing opera, comedy, and ghost stories, etc.</p>
<p>And the only educational programs, except for the fact that the entire radio is teaching English early in the morning, other educational programs, such as Chinese, science, mass literacy teaching, and various knowledge, etc., are simply rare, it can be said that they are almost non-existent. Especially in the evening, when everyone is off work, there are no educational programs at all, and the radio is filled with all kinds of low-level and boring entertainment programs.</p>
<p>I hope that the heads of the radio stations should think about the country and the public, and not only be calculating for money. They should establish practical educational, social, and children's programs (especially in the evening) so that everyone can obtain various knowledge from the air.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also hope that the telecommunications authorities will strictly control the broadcasting programs of the radio stations. Educational programs should account for at least 30% or more, especially in the evening, there must be educational programs.</p>
<h3>Shaw's Famous Work "Caesar and Cleopatra"</h3>
<p>— Sima Hua</p>
<p>Empress Cleopatra's palace now appears extremely chaotic. It is said that Roman soldiers have penetrated deep into Egypt, and Caesar is leading his troops and is about to arrive. At this time, Cleopatra, rather than being an empress, is more like a child because she is terrified. She has fled to the desert, hiding at the foot of the Sphinx.</p>
<p>At this moment, the night is misty and the cold wind blows. She suddenly encounters a kind old man. She tells the old man how fearful she is of the hideous face of the conqueror Caesar. This old man accompanies her back to her exiled desert palace, telling her not to be afraid, for if she is afraid, she is not like an empress. Seeing that Cleopatra is listening to him, he tells her that he himself is Caesar. After hearing this, she is first surprised, then ecstatic. She accepts Caesar's friendship, acknowledging him as her friend, and Caesar promises to teach her how to overcome fear and become a true empress.</p>
<p>Cleopatra's brother, Ptolemy, ascends the throne in Alexandria, supported by many ministers. Caesar then brings Cleopatra to the city of Alexandria. Behind Ptolemy are also Roman troops who, a few years ago, came to Egypt to resolve the issue of succession to the throne. These Romans and Egyptians, under the command of General Achillas, unanimously support this "puppet emperor" in order to maintain their own power.</p>
<p>They are single-mindedly trying to curry favor with Caesar by assassinating Pompey, Caesar's already defeated enemy. However, to their surprise, Caesar regards this act as a brutal assassination. Caesar then tells them, "Regardless of how you conspire here, my troops have already marched into the city in great numbers, surrounding the palace like an iron barrel. If you do not leave immediately, I will detain all of you as prisoners."</p>
<p>These ministers and generals, seeing that the situation is unfavorable, leave dejectedly. This departure allows Cleopatra to happily ascend to her brother's throne, and Caesar teaches her how to be a true empress. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Ethics in the Attic</h3>
<p>— Ji Gan</p>
<p>In the past few days, newspapers have been continuously publishing news of heinous crimes against family ethics, causing readers to sigh at the great change in moral principles. Originally, we were a country that particularly valued human relationships, but now we are witnessing such absolutely opposite evils, which naturally leads to endless sighs.</p>
<p>The great changes in human relations are mostly attributed to the decline of morality, but we do not believe that the people of Shanghai have fallen to such a degree. Compared with compatriots in other parts of the country, the people of Shanghai are really no different. The only difference is the environment.</p>
<p>Speaking concretely, all family tragedies mostly originate from the family environment. The difference between the family environment of Shanghai people and other places is that they often have only one room per family. This room is naturally large or small, but it is always a place of "congregated living." Parents, siblings, spouses, children, sisters, mothers-in-law, etc., all eat, live, and reside in one room. Each person's temperament, likes and dislikes, habits, and occupations are all different, yet they must practice the most narrow form of communal living. Isn't that too difficult?</p>
<p>In the Tang Dynasty, there was a Zhang Gongyi, who lived with nine generations of his family. Emperor Gaozong asked him about the way to live together peacefully, and he wrote a hundred "tolerance" characters. It can be seen that only when each member of a large family is determined to endure can they get along. Endure if you can, and endure even if you can't. The pain in this is imaginable. However, in the former large families, the objective environment was still relatively spacious, and there was never a phenomenon of fathers and daughters or fathers-in-law and daughters-in-law living in the same room. Now, the intimacy of Shanghai families is far greater than that of former large families, so the "tolerance" they need should naturally be increased by dozens or hundreds of times compared to the past. This is indeed impossible.</p>
<p>The most serious crimes in incest cases are murder and adultery. Shanghai is a place where the temptation of wealth and lust is greatest, and many people are in contact with each other in one room day and night. There is no possibility of privacy for any daily activity, no distance to retreat, naturally all kinds of conflicts can arise from this, and all kinds of incestuous behaviors can be caused by this. All of the above can be said to be a problem of housing. If the housing problem is not resolved, then human relations will continue to change greatly, unless they are ideal great sages. Otherwise, it is not easy for all ordinary people to be crowded in an attic and asked to talk about great principles of human relations.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Lan repeatedly expressed to Old Zhu that her refusal to ride in Xu Shaoming's car did not mean that she had to ask Old Zhu to find a car for them; she was willing to go out and try hard, and perhaps find a suitable opportunity by spending more money. But she was wrong! Completely wrong! She had no power, and she really couldn't afford to spend money. In the market these days, from Guilin to Liuzhou, the fairest price is 500,000 yuan per person; many are priced in gold ingots. From Liuzhou to Guiyang, asking for four or five big bars of gold is not uncommon. The driver must also be given two or three small yellow fish as a token of respect, otherwise he might abandon you halfway. How much money does Lan have? A wedding ring of less than two qian, and it's still imitation gold. Who wants it? So until this time, this problem has not been solved. Lu Qian is certainly not very clear about these twists and turns.</p>
<p>"If Old Zhu is willing to let them go with us, I think it will be beneficial to the theater troupe," Zhang Chang said, waving his beloved harmonica, as if giving a speech, "Mrs. Hu's astonishing calmness and gentle character is at least a strong encouragement to us!"</p>
<p>"But what about our car? Alas!" Lu the cripple sighed long as usual.</p>
<p>Their car is being worked on by Old Zhu with great patience. While they were lying on the floor, chatting, Zhu Zhaonian was sitting alone in the waiting room of the Transport Department of the War Zone Commander's Headquarters.</p>
<p>In the past three days, he had been here seven times, each time sitting in this rectangular small room; the shortest time was about one hour, and the longest was four hours and thirty-six minutes, from early in the morning until lunch. These seven times of waiting like waiting for the drum to beat at the yamen gate had made him not only recognize the shape of the room and the interior furnishings, but also be able to tell the number of small holes burned by cigarette butts on the gray-white tablecloth, and the amount of sugar he consumed in each waiting period was also increasing day by day.
