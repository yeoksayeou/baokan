<h3>調整縣級機構財政　慎選嚴核縣級人員　政院重申前令通飭遵辦</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕行政院頃通令各部會及各省府，調整縣級機構財政，减少縣長兼職與牽掣，並慎選嚴校縣級人員，原文如下：</p>
<p>國家值長期抗戰之餘，繼以共匪叛變，地方紛亂極矣，凋敝極矣，為政之要，當以爬梳整理之中，講求生聚教訓之道，地方行政機構，應求其合理緊凑，地方建設經費，因求其專，員吏之素質，應求其能，必須客觀條件大體具備，庶幾地方政治可以有為，如仍墨守成規，囿於現狀，不能通權達變，因時制宜，其何以慰人民復蘇之望，植地方自治之基。本院曾於卅五年五月，遵奉主席手啓，五月十一日府交京七月代電，以節京嘉丁字第一六五九號訓令通飭各省政府，應謀充實地方稅收，以解決縣級財政困難，並斟酌地方財政情形，自行調整縣級機構。此外關於尊重縣長職權，减少縣長兼職等項，中央亦迭經訂定辦法，通飭遵行各在案。最近舉行行政座談會，各省主席仍多以縣級機構龐大，經費難籌，人才難得，以及縣長權責不專，牽掣太多等等為言，具見中央前頒各令地方多未切實舉行，茲特重申前令，並分別剴切規定如左：</p>
<p>一，關於緊縮縣級機構者，查縣各級組織綱要，列舉縣政府各科室，雖甚完備，但曾說明設科之多寡，由各省政府依縣之等次及實際需要擬訂之，並未硬性規定必需一律設置，而事實上各縣對於綱要列舉各單位，大都已普遍設置，其於綱要規定以外陸續添置者，亦頗不少，以致組織龐大，糜費太甚。各省政府應從新斟酌縣之等次及財力盈餘與事實需要，釐定各縣政府組織，最多以五科二室（秘書至會計室）為限，至少亦應有三科一室（會計主任附在秘書室辦公），（邊遠特別小縣，費絀事簡者，不在此例），俾各縣組織，不致過於懸殊，而經費均勉可自給，各科改冠第一第二等番號，俾得視事務之繁簡，調配其戰掌，所有原設其他統計，合作，指導，地籍，整理，度量衡檢定等單位，分別酌留必要人員，派在性質相近之科室辦事，受各該科室主管之監督指揮，執行其專管業務，限各省政府於文到一個月內，遵照妥為規劃，督飭各縣，切實調整，並將從新釐定之各縣政府組織規程報院備案。此次限令緊縮，因以地方財政困難，待遇無法提高，事業末由開展，不得不力圖撙節，以策振奮一俟地方財政整理充裕，自治事業逐漸開展有酌量增加單位，擴大組織之必要時，仍可於提經民意機關通過後，呈准省府增設之，總期厲行緊縮，以振目前之衰頹，亦不長安簡陋，致妨將來之發展。</p>
<h3>增撥地方稅源　嚴禁自由攤派　减少縣長兼職以專責成</h3>
<p>二，關於調整縣級財政者，查縣級財政自財政收支系統法修正以後，稅源已較前寬裕，如田賦分配半數，契稅全部劃予，營業稅亦大半付予地方，惟以稽征未能認真，稅率不甚適當，收入之數，不如所期，而各省政府對於縣級財政又多失之管制過嚴，遂至各縣多不能自給，中央應酌為增撥之稅源，如土菸稅，土酒稅等，應酌予調整之稅率，如屠宰稅，筵席稅，娛樂稅，使用牌照稅，營業牌照稅，房捐等，正由本院督飭財政部迅速計議呈核，一俟完成法案，即予通令施行。田賦為地方主要稅源，各省政府應即責令主管機關及各區專員分別督飭所屬各縣，切實整理，清釐賦册，檢查隱漏，改良稽征，杜絕中飽，並由專員輪駐所轄各縣，眼同清釐，公學產款，務使涓滴歸公，其有普通稅源不豐，特種產物孳息頗大者，可以依照財政收支系統法附表（一）二項第十款之規定，舉辦特種課稅，如西北之畜牧，東南之海產，山區之藥材及特種農作物等，既可供人民生養之資，即可為政府課稅之源，惟應以不違反中央賦稅法令，不妨礙全國經濟發展為限，並須經縣參議會之通過與省政府之核准，仍應報財政部備案。省政府對於縣稅與縣預算之審核，應重視事實需要情形與民意機關意見，不可過於嚴格束縛縣地方政治合理之發展，但對於各地之自由攤派，則應絕對禁止，各省政府應於文到一個月內，妥定整理步驟，切實施行，並按月將整理情形呈報備核。</p>
<p>三，關於减少縣長兼職者　縣長為親民之官，轄地百里，責在一身，凡所措施，均須心到眼到，其事務之繁雜，其責任之重大，逈異一般機關主官，非節其旁務之勞，策其心志之專，俾竭全力以赴之，難期舉其所職，顧以事實所在，縣長兼職繁多，統籌並顧，肆應為勞，若非失之務廣而荒，即或迫使捨本逐末，近日縣政不修，此亦主因之一。本院自廿九年以來，即經一再通令調整，而現在檢討縣長兼職，仍有達十餘種之多者，若不剴切開示原則，督飭切實簡化，何以專縣長之責成，策縣政之發展，茲規定縣長依法應兼之職，如揆諸事實無此必要，應即檢討該項法令，依根本上之改正，其法令之頒自中央者，由中央主管部會檢討修改之，其法令之出自地方者，由省府自行檢討修正之，其事之可以併入縣政府各科室辦理，無需另設機關者，應即裁撤之，必其事不可併，而法不可改者，方得責令縣長繼續兼任，如此嚴格，祗以力求减少，庶使縣長得專心致志於本職，而地方政治之進展，乃可有望。</p>
<h3>除規定長官外　不得對縣用令</h3>
<p>四，關於限制直接指揮縣長者　縣長上承省府，下領鄉鎮，所有轄境之內土地，人民，政事，均由縣長一人為之主宰，其責　重，其權宜專，乃各旁系高級機關或駐防部隊長官，為圖本身工作之便利，每以權責不屬之事委之縣長辦理，並直接以命令指揮督責之，既增額外　繁，尤屬有碍威信，國民政府曾於卅一年二月公布中央各機關及各部隊對縣政府行文用令暫行辦法，通飭施行，該辦法規定除（一）內戰區內或駐防區內之軍長以上官員，關於作戰上之緊急情事，（二）衛戌區或戒嚴區，綏靖區內衛戌司令，戒嚴司令，綏靖主任等關於衛戌，戒嚴，綏靖等軍事行動，（三）各省防空司令，關於防空緊急事宜等，得對各該區域內之縣政府直接用令外，其他任何機關部隊如有必須縣政府辦理事務，應經由省府轉令遵辦，不得直接用令，對縣府濫發命令者，由該管上級機關分別議處。中央規定雖頗嚴密，而地方執行不甚切實，非直接指揮系統，而對縣長發號施令者，仍比比皆是，亟應予以糾正，茲責成各省政府斟酌各縣區情形，分別列舉其應受直接指揮之機關，令知各該縣政府並飭各縣縣政府遇有無直接指揮權，而對之濫發命令者，應即報告省府，負責轉請該管上級機關，予以處分，必如此而後，事繁責重之縣長不致橫遭欺壓，亦必如此而後，濫發命令之機關，庶幾有所忌憚。中央法令之貫澈與縣長職權之保障，均須省政府多負責任，望各省主席勉之。</p>
<p>五，關於縣級員吏之選拔核者　縣級機構既經緊縮，財政既經整理，而縣長又不復兼職業集，秉命多方，則作事之客觀條件，可謂大致具備，如再得健全之僚佐共同努力，縣行政效率之突飛猛晋，可操左券。盱衡目前縣級人事狀况，因待遇之微薄與人才之缺乏，往往就地取材，濫竽充數，任用之先，不遑切實選拔，訓練任用之後，未經嚴格考核獎懲，遂使貪婪無能之輩，亦得　跡仕途，貪汚舞弊之事，因而習成風氣，經此次緊縮機構，整理財政後，員額减少，取才較易，經費充裕，養廉較豐，各省政府應即督飭各縣長，趁此革新時機，切實簡汰部屬，獎廉懲貪，去劣留優，嗣後對於縣級員吏之選拔，訓練，考核，獎懲，應一切依法嚴格辦理，務使貪婪無能之輩絕跡公門，為守兼優之士咸登仕版，則為政得人，著績必易，轉移社會風氣，刷新地方政治，胥於是乎賴焉。</p>
<p>時局艱危，地方困難尤甚，而人民引領望治，國家行憲在邇，一切應興應革之事，均須劍及履及，不容因循廢弛，以上所舉五者，實為改進縣政之基本條件，否則經費竭蹶，而冗員充斥，任務繁重，而職權分歧，將何以責事功，更何以言建設，所望各省政府切實體認，各縣政府深自循省，中央各部會亦了解內外相維，上下一體之旨，儘法令許可之限度，助地方政治之發展，務使此次令示所及，均能迅速澈底施行，其裨益國家前途，當亦未可限量，除分令外，合亟令仰遵照辦理，為要。</p>
<h3>監委李世軍等　視察資源委會</h3>
<p>翁文　說明施政情形</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕監察委員李世軍，張祿，楊迺懦等，廿五日上午十時前往資源委員會，巡視施政情形，首由該會委員長翁文　氏接談，經翁氏大體說明該會之組織及所屬事業設施之概要後，　由該會主任秘書吳兆洪氏會同各主管人員，分別就各類事業報告現况。旋由李委員等提出詢問數點，（一）蘇聯在東北拆遷工鑛設備情形，（二）共匪破壞工鑛設備情形，（三）資委會經行政院指定出售民營之事業，其辦理實况，　經吳氏詳加解答，並將書面資料而　李委員等。</p>
<h3>空運機失踪原因　可能為氣候影響　空軍總部發表搜尋經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕空運大隊C－47，257號蘭迪班機，七月卅日自迪化飛出，當日安抵哈密，次日飛赴嘉峪關途中，即告失踪，迄今下落不明，空軍總部頃發表搜尋經過及該機載運人員名單如次：</p>
<p>失踪經過　C－47，257號機，載客廿一人，於七月卅日九時一刻自迪化起飛，當日十一時半安抵哈密，復於七月卅一日下午二時五十分自哈密起飛赴嘉峪關，起飛後，該機即與本軍嘉峪關電台保持聯絡，且聯絡情形甚佳，至四時五十分，聯絡突告中斷，並經本軍哈密，嘉峪關·蘭州，各電台，長時呼呌，至六時四十分，該機仍無下落，即告失踪。</p>
<p>失踪之可能原因　該日哈密·安西·嘉峪關·張掖·蘭州等地天氣，自下午四時以後，即突然轉變惡劣。雲高降至千尺以下，能見度在一哩以內，並降雪，該機失踪原因，可能受沙漠與山地地帶毗連處之局部天氣突變所形成對溫氣流之影響，使飛機失去操縱，而致失事。至其他可能原因，如機件之臨時突生故障等，皆可使飛機無法操縱，但在未覓得該機遺骸之前，正確原因尚不能確實判斷。</p>
<p>搜　及救護詳情　自該機宣告失踪以後，本軍嘉峪關站通電蘭州專員公署及當地駐軍長官，分別轉請各縣鄉保甲及各地駐軍，全體動員，尋找該機，根據各方面所得情形推測，可能失事之各地區，作有計劃的周密搜索，經三週來空中及地面不斷之努力，仍無結果，本部除繼續空中及地面之搜索外，特先將該機失事情形及人員名單公布：（一）機上工作人員名單，正駕駛劉益祿·副駕駛趙海泉·通訊員鄧又根·機械士徐惠勛。（二）乘客各單，空軍十六部站課長孔憲惠及其妻李靜貞，連小孩一人，機務未來戰士李曾予·焉耆電台台長李良德·軍士趙連城·王德勝·寇冠英·領班張夢初·空特連連長石學孟·空特連副官陳利相·上士劉維先·九分校訓練班眷屬文樹楠（女）·警備總部邱質勵·韓禾然·省黨部書記長謝永存·中訓介阯十分團雷英毅·天山師範學生溫友蘭（女）·天山師範女教部職員呂臣英·記者沙林心·美記者史蒂芬（女）。</p>
<h3>東北人事調動　不日明令發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕記者本日特為東北行轅改組及該方面各高級將領調動事，走訪國防部發言人，詢問詳情，據告：東北行營改組誠為事實，惟人事調動，政府不日將有明令發表，近日外間所傳種種，純係揣測之詞，與事實並不相符。</p>
<h3>平津工協再電中樞　防止日貨走私傾銷　拆遷日工業設備不容延緩</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津廿五日電〕冀平津工務會理事長李燭塵氏，廿三日復就開放對日貿易問題，去電主席及中央各院部會首長，略謂，最近走私日貨，市面傳有大量發現傾銷。侵略之重來，顯已而其先鋒，日人肆行無忌，東蜮多端，將來對日貿易，一經正式開放，其走私傾銷之勢，較之戰前必更變本加厲，防不勝防。吾人於此萬不可忽視，而拆遷其紡織工業設備，實為釜底抽薪，不容姑息延緩之舉。至其化學工業中，則應以主要之純鹼製造工業為目標。現時日本保有之設備，在維持其一九三五年前之生產水準外，確有大量餘裕，况其製鹼原料用鹽，全須仰給於我國，而我之製鹽工業，在淪陷期間，經其摧殘破壞，生產銳减，今以建立中國基本化學工業立場，吾人實有權要求拆遷日本鹽廠，以為我製鹽工業損失之賠償。又日本人造絲工廠，戰時為絕對軍需工業，原應在禁制之列，即以日製造人造絲工廠，戰時為絕對軍需工業，原應在禁制之列，即以日製造人造絲所用主要化學品之燒鹽而言，其生產量亦應按照一九三五年以前之水準加以限制，則其人造絲工廠設備，必亦多歸廢棄。我國所需之人造絲，國內尚乏供給，尤應將日本現有之人造絲工廠，一併拆遷我國，庶我供需可得平衡。</p>
<h3>憲警職權範圍　內政部已擬定</h3>
<p>俟政院批示後即公布</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕關於憲警職權調整辦法，據記者探悉，乃就原有法規重予申論，並明確規定憲警行使職權範圍。其大要為關於一般治安問題，由警察全權負責處理，憲兵不得越權。有關軍人違反治安行為，應由憲兵執行處分，警察亦不得干預。至一般治安秩序若經憲兵查究而須處理者，應即轉知當地警察前往執行，憲兵不得越權。反之，如警察發現有軍人不守治安秩序者，亦當立即請由當地之憲兵前往執法，警察不得干預。若無憲兵駐紮之地區，警察得代行憲兵之職務，未設置警察之地區，憲兵亦得代行警察之職務。上項辦法業經內政部主管方面草擬完成，俟與國防部會同簽請行政院批示後，即可公布。</p>
<h3>第三批分配艦　離日駛青移交</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿五日電〕第三批分配艦艇，三十三艘，已集中佐世保，廿五日，分與蘇聯之春日等九艘駛往庫頁島，分與中國之新月等九艘駛往青島。</p>
<h3>魏使今飛韓視察　使團曾在麥帥總部集議　魏氏對韓局勢已獲輪廓</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿五日電〕美總統特使魏德邁將軍及其調查事實團團員，廿五日開始自麥帥總部中收集關於韓國之消息。該團在東京之工作方式，與在中國時無異。廿五日午，魏氏在橫濱與第八軍司令艾契巴格中將同進午餐，晚間偕其聯絡顧問華生與麥帥同進晚餐。魏氏將於廿六日晨九時半飛赴漢城。據悉：魏氏已獲得韓佔領區之問題，對於盟軍總部對遠東廣泛之政治局勢之意見，亦得一形象。</p>
<p>魏使屬下各專家與總部官員會談關於韓國軍事，政治，經濟各問題，韓國係在麥帥指揮之下，且駐韓美軍司令霍奇中將頃譴責蘇聯在美，蘇聯席會議中之代表鼓勵北韓政客在美佔領區內推動不法行動。魏氏在韓視察八或十日後，將取道東京赴夏威夷，在該地將中韓報告合併成一份，並向杜魯門總統提出建議。</p>
<p>吳鐵城談魏使聲明　認為係建設性批評</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿五日電〕立法院副院長國民黨中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城氏，廿五日語合衆社記者稱：「魏特使之告別文告，對吾人甚有價值，蓋由此，吾人可以將他人對吾人之觀察作為偕鏡」。吳氏繼稱「吾人接受魏氏批評之精神，認此為來自善意友人之　設性批評，吾人將以全力補救吾人之缺點，然中共問題係阻撓國民政府實行改革及建設之一大因素，吾人固然禱求中共放下武器，為人民之利益而合作，但吾人之經騐明示此希望實現之可能極少。共產黨意識係一毒瘤，不割不治，中國政府對人民有責任平定共黨之叛亂，使吾民得享和平，使國家之建設獲以順利展開，吾人並不藉中共危機而不自上進，惟對共戰事，對我國千瘡百孔之原氣誠為大累。共亂之戡平愈早，中國之復興愈快。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿五日電〕共產黨「真理報」今日載稱，美國迭派總統特使赴華，常以軍界領袖為限，此固人盡皆知，魏德邁特使團之真正目標，決非純係調查事實。</p>

<h3>蒙軍又犯北塔山　作「黃牛陣」進襲已被我擊退</h3>
<p>〔中央社駐奇台記者北塔山廿四日急電〕（遲到）昨夜北塔山北麓，外蒙軍一隊約五十餘人，於雨雪冰雹交織中，向我胡芝爾特前哨陣地進攻。蒙軍作戰有如「黃牛陣」，蜂擁而來，冰雹最猛時，槍聲亦最密，來襲蒙軍均為我軍火力所壓制。按旬日來，蒙軍後方甚為活躍，每日均有五六輛大卡車載運軍隊至前綫，當為大戰之準備。二十三晚九時，蒙軍三十餘人亦乘大霧進攻我烏斯滿部，被擊退。一般判斷，蒙軍似在試探我主力所在，以便大舉進攻。</p>
<h3>孫副主席抵廣州　各界定今晨舉行歡迎會</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿五日電〕孫副主席廿五日晨乘永興軍艦由澳門抵穗，下午四時在沙面登陸，穗全市縣旗及架搭牌樓歡迎，情况熱烈。各界歡迎大會定廿六日上午十時在中山紀念堂舉行，市府原預定將黃沙至東堤改為　生路，廿五日舉行命名典禮，後以籌備不及而展期，蓋穗首任市長為孫副主席也。又據中山訊：孫副主席在石岐會發表談話稱：外間對魏使來華每多誤測，渠從未聞魏使對中國政府有不滿之批評，渠相信魏使返美後，對中國必能有所帮助，吾人不應存有恐懼心理，美國今日雖有强冠世界，但一民主國家當尊重民意，故美國不但對中國無領土及物資搶奪，勞役人民等野心，對世界亦然，吾人應乘今日美國有重工業龐大力量時機，歡迎來協助我國戰後復興。</p>
<h3>廣九路傳奇</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>南遊雜草之二</p>
<p>這是中國鐵路史上的奇蹟之一。</p>
<p>從廣州到九龍，全長一七八·五五公里，而九龍到深圳間的三五·七八公里，却屬於英段，換言之，其餘的一四二·七七公里為華段，屬於我國所管轄。抗戰以前，直到抗戰勝利，廣九鐵路是獨立的單位，勝利後全國鐵路系統分區管理，比如南潯鐵路併入浙贛區，滬杭鐵路併入京滬區，而廣九廣三兩路也併入粵漢區。</p>
<p>我曾問過粵漢鐵路局局長杜鎮遠先生，知道粵漢區每月客貨運收入，百分之四十左右靠廣九，而粵漢路自武昌至廣州全長一千〇八十公里，較廣九幾達七倍，七與一之比的路綫距離，六與四之比的客貨運收入，這道理除去行車狀况外，主要的還是在九龍那面有個海外出口。</p>
<p>如果大家不健忘的話，抗戰期間，在廣州淪陷之前，我們利用廣九路的運輸，不啻終日在向人磕頭乞求狀態下，今日，事過暗遷，合作又重新開始了，可是當其事者的痛苦，和困擾，又怎能為局外人所能想像得到。</p>
<p>舉個最近的例子：</p>
<p>八月十五日午後三時卅分，在布吉站發生撞車慘劇，當場死火伕兩名及旅客兩名，旅客重傷三人，輕傷三人，肇禍原因係因港來穗滿載鐵路器材專車一列，於駛抵距廣州一三八公里半處，最後三卡的車鈎突斷，向布吉站倒流，而向停在站帝的由穗開深圳九十六次貨車猛撞，令九十六次機車及第二三四五各卡同時出軌。</p>
<p>事後，粵漢路局方面聲明該次車係由英段開出，司機司爐均係英段所派，所以認為此次慘案應由英段負責。英段方面則說出事地點係華段，而且列車是行總所配給，車鈎構造不同，以致發生脫鈎情事，所以英段不能負責。雙方互相推諉，到底責任誰屬呢，到現在還沒有得着結論。</p>
<p>從這個近例上，我們是不難看出廣九路不統一各自為政的奇異演變來的，而未來的悲劇，誰能斷定它將不再發生呢？</p>
<p>廿七年秋我曾經從香港經過廣九路粵漢路到漢口，九年的時間相隔，廣九路沿綫並沒有什麽特殊變化，然而廣九車上的風景，却和九年前大不相同。</p>
<p>車上的風景，和三十四年九月剛勝利後我在京滬綫上所看見的一模一樣，大批跑單帮的，大批走私客，擠滿每一節車廂，當每次車抵達廣州或九龍時，這些「輕騎兵」大都以衝鋒姿態奔向出口，情狀比空襲時逃警報似乎還更緊張。</p>
<p>廣九路上的走私頗有梁山泊的氣慨，不少退役軍人靠這條路來養家活口，他們往往帶個幾十　香烟，或者幾件衣料，從九龍販來，到廣州脫手，每次來回賺個十幾二十萬元。他們很豪爽直率，當遇到海關緝私人員時，他們會很坦白地說：</p>
<p>「朋友，打了八年仗，一身無長物，祗　下這宗寶貝了」，說着會取下他腰間那支手槍向緝私人員幌一幌，又用那支手槍指指脚前那包東西說：</p>
<p>「沒有辦法，靠這個來混一碗飯吃吃。」</p>
<p>自然，大部份的這些豪傑們是從半途上車，而又在未到目的地的前一站下車，走小徑便道來逃過緝私或稅收的關卡的。然而，依附於這條廣九路而走私來養家活口的，那是港粵間走私的小焉者也案件，他們不過是為了混碗飯吃而獨自作戰，這比起走水路的大規模組織來，那無異小巫之於大巫了。</p>
<p>因佛山輪的夾艙秘密機關的破壞，人們曾傳說着廣九機車（即火車頭）中亦有藏匿私貨的處所，普通人常謂對於機車的構造和部位是隔閡的，而煤倉水箱以及引擎等處，不易被人所注意，其聯接或　隙更非內行所明瞭，於是那便成為最安全的夾帶處了。利之所在，尤其在這樣的環境氛圍中，因之，我們很難相信，這傳說沒有幾分可能性了。自然，截至目前為止，還沒有發生一件什麽事故在機車中。但願這傳說祗是傳說而已。</p>
<p>東莞一帶的水災怵人心目，從車窗眺望，像身在河中行舟，有許多地方，水已與鐵路路基成平行綫了。車到每一小站，呌賣龍眼，雞蛋，大焦，臘味飯，……的男女兒童各種聲響，其巨大噪雜不僅為京滬綫所不及，即粵漢綫也不能相比擬。它告訴我這是災區風景，這是求生的緊迫掙扎。</p>
<p>同行的S君指着窗外遠處一縷冉冉炊烟向我說：</p>
<p>「我最怕看到傍晚時分鄉村中的炊烟，它使我想起家。」</p>
<p>我說：</p>
<p>「你的家鄉現在與這里恐怕也不會兩樣罷。」</p>
<p>The　Way　Of　Blood　Or　Gold一個外國女同業會經用這句話稱呼過滇緬公路，坐在廣九車車廂中我突然想起她這個名稱來了。</p>

<h3>蔡爾達理斯再度努力　希新閣今可成立　美希望自由黨參加合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播雅興訊：蔡爾達理斯筄，渠與各黨領袖再度會商以後，希望能於本日下午七時將擬定之閣員名單呈遞國王。又悉，蔡氏曾與開卷有益大使麥克維會談，探討美國對組閣之意見。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：蔡爾達理斯發表談話稱：渠希望即日組成希臘新　，儘量採取廣泛之聯合體制，以代　　倒之內閣。美大使館示意自由黨領袖蘇福里斯，希望自由黨參加新政府，并建　蘇福里斯對人民黨提出之「聯合指揮」建議提出反建議。蘇福里斯對蔡爾達理斯之答覆并未公佈，但據某官方稱，蘇氏曾謂人民黨政策如果失敗，自由黨將單獨執政云。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿五日電〕受命組閣之人民黨領袖蔡爾達理斯，今日開始　各黨領袖，曾訪自由黨領袖前總理蘇福里斯。此間美國外交界對於希臘政局之發展，正予密切注意，美大使麥克維昨夜入宮謁保祿王，事後麥氏表示，「吾人盼望得有更自由基礎之希臘政府，英美之在此係為指導及供獻意見，對於政黨及個人并不感覺興趣」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社雅典廿四日電〕雅典城內警察憲兵及陸軍已採取警戒，防止任何暴動之可能。關於組閣事，若干觀察家認為就國防部長維尼瑞洛斯廿三日之緊急聲明，「若柴羅伐斯將軍戀棧不去，美國勢必停止以武器及配構供給希政府以制止遊擊隊」觀之，柴羅伐斯將軍不致參加新內閣甚屬可能。若干有資格觀察家相信，若柴氏退出內閣，希政府與遊擊隊間關係可能改善。</p>
<h3>美緊急軍用物資　源源由海道運希　美官員發表廣播檢討援希計劃</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕美國務院頃宣佈：美國為加緊援助希臘起見，已將五萬長噸之緊急軍事供應品由海道運往希臘，同時美海軍并將以一百七十六呎長之巡船六艘移交希臘政府。各該巡船之希臘海員將於本月抵美，接受嚴厲之訓練，此外美方將大批掃雷艇另件移交希臘海軍。按希臘因鐵路破壞甚大，全賴海洋航行維持運輸，是以掃雷工作極為重要。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕國務院近東及非洲司司長漢德森昨廣播稱：最近在南阿境內秘密經營之「自由希臘」廣播電臺，業聲明建立一新的「希臘民主政府」。渠稱，此項行動將可使其他國家取作藉口，以便承認此一所謂「自由希臘」，進一步協助游擊隊。渠稱，「假定在聯大會開會以前，局勢發展至嚴重情況，則將有採取激烈行動援助希臘之必要。」</p>

<h3>馬歇爾援歐計畫　不致以西歐為限　與遠東等地亦有關聯</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿四日電〕美政府經濟廿四日觀察馬歇爾計畫一旦實行，除西歐各國外將牽涉更多之國家。彼等認為若遠東，南美各國，加拿大，南非，澳洲及紐西蘭諸國，在馬歇爾計劃工作時，將直接或間接參於其間。由於此一層，此批經濟家對西歐未來食糧之一般悲觀見解并不過分重視。彼等承認目前食糧展望毫不光明，惟對一般以為西歐若干年內食糧不能自給之形象則并不引以為憂，其理由為：</p>
<p>西歐困難并不嚴重</p>
<p>（一）西歐發展農產之力量較一般人之見解為大。（二）東西歐間之「鐵幕」并不能阻止西歐工業國生產東歐農業國所亟需之產品，故食糧產品之交換必能發展，此舉可大大削減缺少農產品國家之匱乏。彼等相信，西歐之製品與需要間之不協調，并無預計中之大。如西歐能以其出品向世界各地易得所需，加之以美國之援助，則一切問題迎刃而解矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿五日廣播：英內閣廿五日舉行緊急會議，討論美國輸入糧食可能減少百分之五十至七十五問題，以及附帶發生之核減國內食糧配給問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕英國內閣定今日開會，由艾德禮總理主持，討論問題大抵為金鎊限制兌換美元後之影響。此外，煤產問題或亦在討論之列。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕英內閣於今日開會時，將有三大問題須待決定：（一）減少自美元區之糧食輸入後，英國人民應得之糧食新配給量；（二）修正東半球非美元國家之輸入計劃，英國今已重獲英鎊之控制權，而此等國家固均需要英鎊；（三）佔計自治領所能供給英國本自美國獲取各供應物之數量。此三大問題之決定，雖需要相同時期之研究，然關於英人糧食配給量之臨時性決定，在一星期內即可成立。內閣同時且將聆取伊第將出席華盛頓財政會議之報告，伊氏可望於今日十二時半抵倫敦一說伊第不久將再返華盛頓。關於華盛頓英美財政會談之主要未決問題，乃為美國堅持英美借款協定第九條禁止歧視之款，在經國會以特別法案予以刪除以前，須繼續有效。惟目前雙方已成立折衷協議，由美國「非正式」承認英國之不能遵守該款。據英國財政專家稱，此一折衷協議僅事承認現局中不能逃避之事實。英國現已轉向其自治領及歐洲國家覓取緊密之經濟合作。</p>
<h3>法人民同盟昨宣告成立</h3>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿五日電〕戴高樂將軍廿五日正式成立其法國人民大同盟，同時宣稱，渠將提出候選人之名單，以便參加十月間之市政選舉。渠堅稱同盟之對象，乃法國共產主義，但絕非一政黨。同盟超越黨派之界限，候選人可以有不同之政見，惟在為公眾謀福利之前提下，參加大同盟。</p>

<h3>汽車動醫院　駛進農村服務　公濟醫院心血結晶設備盡善盡美　大場除慶畔擠滿一羣求治農民</h3>
<p>一輛五噸重的道奇卡車經過近一年來不斷地裝配改造，耗費了設計者無窮的心血，完成了一輛專為農村服務的流動醫院。在一個盛署逼人的早晨—八月十七日—它偷偷地溜出了公濟醫院的大門，離開那繁華的都市，直往農村駛去。發動和設計建造這輛流動醫院的兩位院長—朱仰高醫師和丁名全醫師—領帶二十餘位工作人員，包括內外產科主任醫師，X光醫師，化驗員，藥劑生，事務主任，掛號員以及工役，他們都靜靜地坐在車中。</p>
<p>流動醫院出着緊急的鳴聲，開足速力，衝出熱鬧沉悶的市中心區，車中工作人員也抱着同樣的情調盼望早臨目的地—大場餘慶橋。</p>
<p>內外產科化驗　器械色色齊備</p>
<p>一路野景平凡，不足瀏覽，記者的腦筋又不由地轉到這輛流動醫院身上，記者以前見過不少的救護車，說也苦憐，大都設備簡陋，眼看着這輛流動醫院，設備應有盡有，不枉稱為「醫院」，在國內可說是絕無僅有，裏面裝着發電機，X光透視和攝影的設備，化驗部包括顯微鏡和普通臨床化驗用藥械，內科方面，有一隻滿儲各種常用藥物的藥箱和配藥用具；外科產科方面，有全套可以施行大手術的器械，此外設備，還有兩隻可以帶病人回來的軟軟的病床，一個蓄水八十加侖的大水箱，一個可放兩隻手術臺的大蓬帳，以及附件木棍幾十根，圍住蓬帳不讓外人走近蓬帳的不少網球網，內科各有一隻出診箱，預備在汽車不能通達地方帶着它步行走訪問重病患者，此外幾十磅的酒精，幾十磅的蒸餾水，計算一下，這些設備就夠塞滿一車子，可是設計者靈巧地利用着車璧車底和坐位下的空隙，所以車內還盡可坐上十多個人。</p>
<p>斷　殘壁中間　迅速搭起蓬帳</p>
<p>正在這時，車子停了，車子停處，是中華兒童健康院舊址的門口。全體人馬，一擁而下，稍稍勘察地址，就在斷　殘壁中立刻動手佈置。那兒育才學校的先生們和學生們都萬分熱忱地願意裏助他們，可是他們婉辭謝絕了，原來他們想用自己帶來的人力和設備來計算一下佈置全套設備所需的時間。不分識別，敏捷地工作，居然在半小時內，搭起蓬帳，網球網圍在外圍，掛號處開始掛號，發電機早已開動了，蓬帳內的電燈亮了，電爐上的水在沸騰着了，傷寒霍亂預防注射開始了，掛號處人愈來愈多，但是仍維持相當好的秩序，內科醫生拿起聽診器，藥劑生在配藥，外科醫生檢視傷口，要化驗的病人已候在化驗處等報告，X光機器在發着光，X光醫師躲在那四面不通風的車子裏，忙得滿頭大汗，兩位院長到處巡視，隨時把需要添置或改革的事項記下來，記者雖為觀光而來，被他們那種緊張和興奮的工作情況所吸引，很不得也參加他們一份工作，盡一些義務。</p>
<p>一個病人在流動醫院內掛號，看病，取藥，加上各種檢驗，最多等不上一個鏡頭，這比起來城市內的大醫院看病一等等半天，真不可同日語了。</p>
<p>外頭勁的女人　就地施行手術</p>
<p>我正在內科門診部閒觀，忽然聽到站在手術室那兒的朱院長在喊：</p>
<p>「伍老先生，願意來這兒看看嗎？」</p>
<p>一個三十開外的女人在預備往手術台上躺去。兩位外科醫師指給我看，這個鄉下女人五歲時勁部燙傷，愈後在勁上留下個大疤，以致頭老是老是歪在左邊，不能向右轉，幾十年來，她就過着這種生活，現在要用整形術把它改正過來，一會兒她就能頭向右轉了。</p>
<p>手術開始了，蓬帳頂上有隻日光燈，正中放着手術台，旁邊是手術台和手術燈，外科醫師的背後各有一架電風扇，護士小姐和工友們在蓬帳的外圍不斷地在噴射DDT，以防蚊蠅飛進蓬帳。手術不久完成，病人站起來，擺動着頭向右兩位醫師道謝。在流動醫院服務的一位工友，望着她的背影，自言自語說着：「在上海的大闊老也沒有這種福氣送上門來開刀呢！」</p>
<p>進了野營式的午飯，又開始工作了。到下午四時，這一批工作人員收拾一切打算回去，圍觀的農民和學生問：「您們什麽時候再來呢？」</p>
<h3>一忽兒摃來　盲腸炎病人</h3>
<p>車子開到大場鎮民眾教育館，又停下車來工作兩小時。車子正要開回兩小時。車子正要開回上海的時候，一位鄉人從幾里路外奔來，據說家中有個病人，好像患盲腸炎，想請流動醫院的醫師去看一看，外科醫師聞訊，拔腳就跑。一小時後一位患盲腸炎已化膿的女病人用着流動醫院上的擔架往車上病床上送去。在開車前五分鐘，還有很少鄉下人趕了幾里路來看病，可惜時間太晚，東西也都已歸好，車子業已發動，只能安慰他們下次再來了。</p>
<p>在回公濟醫院的路上，記者問擔任掛好的陳先生今天門診病人有多少，她從箱內拿出一張單子給我看。上面寫着：內科門診病人九十一人，外科門診病人八十五人，婦科門診病人五人，傷寒霍亂預防注射八十八人。</p>
<p>二十多位工作人員忙了一整天，精神仍很飽滿，朱院長抽着香烟，靠在椅背上沉思。</p>
<p>木閘上面挖洞　病人量力付費</p>
<p>「朱院長，這次貴院的工作，雖是演習性質，但是您們工作人員的精神太好了，工作也太有意義了！」記者向他說。</p>
<p>「不敢當，經過了這一次的演戲，發現要改良的地方還很多，想發展的是農村防癆運動和痧眼防治運動，一架放映機，宣傳衛生防疫常識是在計劃之中的。原來打算在車上裝一個短波對講無綫電，以便隨時隨地可與醫院聯絡，這個辦法交通部不准，恐怕沒有希望了，這是很遺憾的。以後打算再造幾輛，一定不會像這次困難，因為這次是改了再改啊！下星期六還要到大場去一次。下月初或許還要到南京去一次。下月初或許還要到南京去一次，希望大家來研究改進的方法，並且希望大家來研究改進的方法，並且希望大家多多推廣，能有更多的流動醫院開往鄉村去。」</p>
<p>「我極願意做流動醫院的義務宣傳員，我還有一個問題，我怎樣沒有看見您們向病人收費？」</p>
<p>「哈哈！我們要拿最好的東西給農村，我們不打算在農民身上多收費用，我們收費的方式也有些特別，說着，用手指給我一隻木匣子，上面挖了一個洞，病人隨意量力放些錢進去，不付錢也行。我們仿效的是上海張整齊的辦法，這是對窮人最妥善的辦法，我們今天便採用了。」</p>
<p>「今天我們一共恐怕沒有收到幾萬塊錢」掛號員在報告，一面用手在搖動那隻木匣。（特公）</p>

<h3>四少女謀生落陷　欲歸不得　被迫賣淫　薦頭店主婦販賣人口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕常熟路警分局日前破獲一販賣人口逼良為娼案，緣有歸縣女子　香娟（二十歲）·麥翠珍（廿六歲）·王玉琴（廿一歲）·朱翠琴（十六歲），前因家貧，從鄉至縣城幫傭，識城內開設薦頭店之主婦　翠芝。最近　忽詭稱上海有羊毛廠招雇女工，每月可得薪工數十萬。四女乃辭去鄉間職務，於本月十八日由　伴同來滬，逕送斜土路北趙家宅廿六號楊彪處，謂一切由楊照料介紹，渠即先行返鄉。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國國民黨上海特別市第九次全市代表大會，昨日上下午繼續在市參議會開會，於下午七時圓滿閉幕。開幕式由方主委主席，致閉幕詞，嗣通過宣言，高呼口號，於軍樂悠揚聲中閉幕。</p>
<p>房荒嚴重深以為愧</p>
<p>昨晨九時舉行之第二次大會，由吳市長作施政報告，略稱：上海施政問題，可分四部份言之：（一）普通行政問題，舉其要者，計有三類，（甲）這路洗澡，抗戰八年，曾未修理，勝利後離經與修，依目前市政收入情形，實大感困難，但市府仍在努力進行中。（乙）交通擁擠，在紐約，芝加哥等大都市皆然，上海道路建築古舊，路面　　，而車輛滑多，是為擁擠之主要原因。（丙）房荒問題，一方面固因人口集中都市所致，但零一方面無人建屋，實為主因之一。市府原撥造屋，因物價變動太快未能成為事實，以致本市房荒，經久無法解決，深以為愧。</p>
<p>物價牽動社會問題</p>
<p>（二）因合併租界而發生之問題，已組織租界清理委員會，目前舊公共租界業已全部交清，舊法租界正在交涉中。（三）經濟問題，為全國性問題，故須配合中央政策解決，為職權所限，市府僅能在消極方面，取締黑市及投機而已。復因經濟問題所發生之各種社會問題，如（甲）因物價高而有撥取，因攤販致碍交通，因有　戶而多火警疫　。市府顧及貧民生活。（乙）市府本身因物價撥動，今年預算，迄未能編織，（丙）工資隨物價而高，工廠多因不勝負擔而倒閉，市府力促勞資協調，工資作有限度之增加。（四）黨派問題，國民黨乃為國為民，在謀全市市民之安寗與繁榮，至如有企圖破壞，發動罷工之陰謀份子，政府當依法予以制裁。</p>
<p>主持正義精誠團結</p>
<p>吳氏最後宣稱：上海施政，困難甚多，為他處所未有，難已度過重重難關，而問題依然存在，希望全市同志，精誠團結，以其求克後難關，並向各代表貢獻數點：（一）主持正義，（二）檢舉貪污，（三）提倡節約，（四）精誠團結。旋即開始討論添，中午吳市長假中央銀行俱樂部歡宴全體代表，下午三時繼續討論田，議決通過「普通建立基層組織，加強黨國活動」,「轉呈中央充實基層黨部經濟力量，以增加工作效能」，及臨時動議「請大會即電中央迅予沒收或無息備用一般豪門資產者全部存美外匯，以充國家復興人存款，以解決國內經濟危機「等六十四案。大會對於方主委黨務報告及吳市長施政報告，經審查後，均有所決議。</p>

<h3>冀西前綫堅强堡壘　保定解圍</h3>
<p>〔本報張家口廿一日訊〕保定解圍了，這飽嘗驚惶槍痛的　西古城，已經受了一次暴風雨的衝擊，記者隨軍進入保定，作第一次的巡禮。今春以來，保定一直就三面臨敵，只有平保路，是唯一的動脈，當它被隔斷的時候，保定就成爲了縣在敵後的孤島。</p>
<p>戰爭的風雲過去了，戰爭的景色依然存在。城四周深溝高壘，帶着針刺的鐵絲密如蛛網城裏每晚十點鐘封閉城門，實行戒嚴。每天總有成萬的民伕，挖修城濠，從早晨六點鐘到十點鐘，街頭便出現了民伕的行列，三五成羣，肩扛鐵鍬，手拿乾糖，嘻笑着，蹣跚着，走向工地。一鍬一鍬，外濠挖深了，碉堡樓完成了，人們的血汗，築成生命的長城。</p>
<p>保定是不怎樣受人重視的河北省會，它和北平天津鼎足而立，文化政治的重心是在北平，商業貿易，却又爲天津奪去繁榮，它竟比不上新典的石家莊——平漢路修築前，石家莊還只是荒僻的小村落。它好像被</p>
<p>攝去了靈魂的軀殼，沒有生氣，沒有活力。</p>
<p>保定，實際上是河北的「行都』這裏的軍政大員，經常往來於平保之間，但他們的公館，大概都在北平。設在北平的指揮所，是發號施令的神經中樞，竟比綏署還要活躍神氣。</p>
<p>河北的政治，據說是『婆婆多，不好辦。管事的說嘴的人多，負責任辦事的人少。』黨政軍團還沒有凝成一個整個的力量。尤其在大選前夕，都熱中於佈置競選，如何配合軍事，開展收復區工作，反被看做次要的問題。</p>
<p>城裏幾道古典式的大街，整齊而且古趣盎然，爲路窄狹，幸虧汽車不多。保定不是貨物集散的中心，所以亦就沒有甚大的商號。交易塲所相當蕭條，尤其在圍城期間，鄉間的人進不來，火車不通，貨遝不暢，購買力的降低，使商業呈現不景氣。</p>
<p>由於敵對形勢的存在，城市與鄕村受着嚴密的封鎖，旣不能公開交易，於是就不免發生偷偸摸摸的</p>
<p>「走私」現象共匪以棉花來套換城裏的物資，前幾天曾運走一大批藥品，聽說以前還能買出子彈。「靠山燒柴，靠水吃魚」，把關守口，担任檢査的職位，就成了「肥缺」。</p>
<p>文化的枝葉，逐漸枯萎，保定正患着營養不良的文化貧血症。本地出版的，只有一張四開的「保定日報」，編排內容却像晚報。除多了幾條地方新聞外，它的銷路，是被當日來的平津報紙奪一去。書肆中僅擱着一兩本新的維誌，書架上充滿舊小說和充滿着低級趣味的書刊，戰爭使人煩燥，埋在舊小說中消脾歲月的心理一座電影院，一個戲院，現在分別由保安司令部政工隊上演話劇，和四維劇校公演新平劇，算是這裏唯一的藝術活動。</p>
<p>西大街的市塲，是商業的中心，雖沒有北平東安市塲的密集與繁華，但亦頗具規模。幾個大的院落，互相貫通來往的人，有如穿梭。</p>
<p>去過保定的人，都要買幾簍「保府小菜與甜麵醬」送人，這是保定知名的特產，西大街的『槐茂號」，是醬菜　醬的權威，門口有兩假人才可合抱的槐樹，作爲它的標記，一百多年的歷史，將它的身份地位駕凌其他同業之上。最好的菜，要數醬杏仁，花生仁，與醬笋，每斤七八千元。普通買混合各樣的醬菜，每小簍三千五百元，畢竟貨高味醇，不同凡物。</p>
<p>平保路破壞門頭溝的煤運不來，鄕村受封銷，糧食進不了城，燃料與食糧成了保定的珍品。碎煤與劈柴，要七百元一斤，白麵賣到四千多元，這裏人民是在物價的高壓下，度着艱難的生討。</p>
<p>「蓮花池」是城裏唯一的名勝，假山似石，亭台閣榭，使一座大的院落，點綴成一所公園。蓮池周匝數十丈，界以石欄杆，但池水早已乾涸，所謂「蓮花池」早已成了歷史上的名字。前人植樹養蓮，令人却連一朶鮮花亦無心栽培，戰亂絞煞了園中風趣，人們也失去了賞花玩景的心情。</p>
<p>南城牆外有名的曹銀花園，現在是四存中學的校址，校園的兩座門，學生們，荷槍守衛，保衛戰中，同學們也全副武裝。暑假期間，</p>
<p>匪區的同學回不了家，學費無着，一切需要自給自足，以每天一萬五千元的代價，他們充當雇工，替別的人家當民伕作工。半工半　，他們已在自食其力。</p>
<p>記者離開保定的時候，平保路還未銜接，由保定到定興要靠汽車，聽說共匪還在徐水以南刧過兩次路，打死司機，搶光乘客，並刧持同車的軍政人買。近來風雲又緊，當河北共匪一日沒有肅淸，戰雲隨時就會在保定的外圍合攏。修築工事是需要的，但只靠防禦，保不住安全，濠溝阻止不住敵人，目前需要軍政更有效的配合，把我們的政治力量推進到每個角落去。（特派記者竭忠）</p>

<h3>華股買勢轉旺多數高價結束</h3>
<p>華股昨證券帮心理向榮，魏特使之聲明，使買方較爲堅定，而活動份子若二二三號多頭加碼，二二四號由空翻多，以致求過於供，近午終吿秀利，泰半以高價結束，脚地十分穩定，前途似有小康局面。</p>
<p>晨開見昂，現永紗經六一號開高至二三〇元後，遞永紗遂不得不呈倒掛之象。開後即交永紗因二二三號一四號逢高了結而稍低，但遞永紗經一一二號等買進，而尙升至二三一元。四五號等紛賣，曾盤低至二二四元。七七等趁低來進，一六三號等賣出，有較長時間之掙扎不已。</p>
<p>延至十時三十分後，二二三號等買進，一〇四號三二號並進現永紗，乃回升至二三〇元。四五號一八六號逢高尙有供給而稍盤。十一時半後，二二四號九四號吸納不已，一五四號力購現永紗，臨收前曾漲到二三三元及二三四元高價，而後以二三二元及二三三元之價結束。</p>
<p>收後二二三號仍買而吿徽升，結果蛟上週六即交股計永紗信和美亞永公各漲半成光景，新華漲起一成强，新光景福中法微升，勤興獨平，中絲漲一成弱，新亞升半成，內衣大通微挫，麗安獨平，餘均微升。遞交各股計美亞漲一成弱，景福永紗信和各漲半成左右，華　新光微升，塲外各老股除新新達　華證外，均吿微升迄半成不等。</p>

<p>外股昨續向榮，業亦之刺激助買，陣容見堅，房產環境有利，銀行帮再吸業廣。怡紗晨開八七五〇〇元，自八七〇〇〇元升至八八五〇〇元收市，洋商有扒，廣帮證券帮則出。結果較上週六計業廣漲半成，會德豐尙平，餘股均吿小漲。</p>

<h3>李立俠談　當前物價趨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行稽核處處長李立俠，昨以個人地位，對當前物價趨勢，及行莊檢査問題，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>（一）物價問題，根據近年來觀察所得，一年中物價波動之可能性，上半年佔三分之二，下半年佔二分之一。每年在七月以後，物價趨勢，即逐步趨向穩定。此緣我國以農立國，七月後屆秋收時期，農村物資，大量生產，都市通貨，流向農村。故都市物傻，在下半年中，常較平穩。惟中秋以後，紗布價格，以晨民添布關係，或不無波動。惟自復員後，各增紗　布機普遍增加，故預料本年紗布價格，亦不致波勵。</p>
<p>抽查行莊</p>
<p>（二）行莊檢査問題：本市行莊檢査事務，係財部直接主管，國行處於協助地位。最近財部吊銷若千銀行執照後，本市行莊，大多已知所警惕，項替牌號之事，已見减少。當局檢査方式，將先就不穩行莊，予以抽査。業務穩建之行莊，將儘量避免抽査，俾輔導金融業，走上營業正軌云。</p>

<p>現棉沉寂</p>
<p>昨日棉市况，因棉紗上漲，入心向上，紗廠因紗價突好，趨勢未穩，棉花納胃雖有，然不肯出價，致花市欲漲無力，交易反致沉寂，成交不多。各檔做開送廠價：靈寳二一二萬，山東美種一九五萬，南太倉一六九萬。棧交　　寳二〇五萬，沙市一九三萬，周滿籽花三一萬八千</p>

<h3>持貨者不肯脫手　人造絲價格上漲　廠經綢貨昨日略呈活躍</h3>
<p>人造絲因配售絲尙未出貨，市上需要甚殷，故持貨者乘機扳抬，昨市給果比上週末漲起五十萬元。一二〇號高山及金三馬旭字等有光，開盤在二千六百二十萬元左右，下午最高喊七百萬元，卒又回低至六百五十萬元收盤。</p>
<p>廠經趨勢略呈活躍，各級喊價仍與上週六相仿。干經脚地甚硬，交易雖稀，喊價未動。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市被面比上週末漲起廿五萬元强，華强貨開市在三十萬元之左，最大到四十八萬元。格子璧　喊價三萬八千五百元，但乏成交。秋令貨已有去胃，價亦稍好。</p>
<h3>粳秈米疲挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市到米共計五千七百餘石，南市早薄稻去化轉懈，猛跌萬餘元，粳秈亦疲三五千元，白陰元挺秀，新粳定勢，新秈各路均到，下挫萬元。北市新陳秈米均疲三五千元，粳米亦然不振，惟早薄稻貨稀仍挺，白元新粳彷彿。</p>
<p>麵粉微升千元，廠方因原料高昂，售心甚堅，洋粉仍居疲勢。麩皮立定，豆餅高貨略加千元，中關平平，市况早堅午淡。黄豆本街動而不旺，油廠揀巧納取，市形平定之格。</p>
<p>菉豆依然相仿，苞米北洋停辦，狂跌萬餘元，蠶豆萎靡不振，芝蔴洋莊動辦，同升萬元。生仁高俏次平，小麥各產地均漲，客心堅挺，步砌三五千元。</p>
<p>油市上落甚微，　生油來貨不多，仍居堅定之格。桶生油平定，廠生油因植物油廠大量拋售，回挫一二萬元。蔴油立定，菜油暫少呼吸，淸油平平。豆油則常鍋崑山來貨甚多，廠方供源接續，回跌萬元。</p>
<h3>歷年呢絨上落比較</h3>
<p>自民國二十二年至本年呢絨變遷，上落極鉅，茲將歷年行情槪要，分誌如次：</p>
<p>二十二年五月一日廢兩改圓，二十二日新稅則公佈，呢羢標準行情仍較上年爲低廉，以東西洋貨運到充斥故也。</p>
<p>二十六年七七事變，滬上交易銳减，進口貨齊上關棧。八一三滬戰爆發，營業停頓半月餘，同業對到貨均函電止裝或退脫，在途者多暫卸香港星洲等埠。</p>
<p>三十年貨價全部在漲，因中外時局環境關係，造成手中有資金者，紛紛囤積貨物，同時申地人口集中，街銷激發，客銷因水睦交通增强而亦暢辦。舶來品呢絨各貨運到困難，造成本廠貨呢絨爲天之驕子。囤購者以利益優厚，業內外人改做踢皮球營業者日衆。十二月八日，敵軍進駐租界，呢絨市氣突降。雖以香港淪落，大戰已起，來源斷絕，然値年底關係，成欲漲乏力之象。</p>
<p>三十一年敵僞令以二比一改用僞幣，呢絨行情與日俱漲，民衆對僞幣無信心，囤踢之風更熾。</p>
<p>三十四年二三月份市價會一度下跌，大半跌進限價之內，本客銷路均大减少。四月中句後，價突飛漲蓋受美總統羅斯福死後受市塲謠傳，利買消息農佈，呢羢價必漲，七八月上漲更烈。至八日十五日，日本正式無條件投降，聯合國大勝利，貨價方見急轉直下而下跌。十月一日賣買一律改以法幣為標準，然受郵資車票船價水電公川事業上漲，及內地人員到滬添製衣着者極多關係，益以廠方生產缺乏，行情乃又繼續躍漲。</p>
<p>本年因種種環境關係，及受金米日用品等百物飛漲影響，呢絨價莫不全部突飛猛漲。而本廠貨則憔我獨尊，一無提高一盤。</p>
<p>邇來中信局運到大批日貨呢絨，同時香港私貨運滬亦多，兼値炎暑，本客帮實銷落令，行情稍見回疲。</p>
<p>茲將歷年行情刊佈於下：</p>
<p>貨別　廿二年八月　廿六年八月　卅年八月　卅四年八月　最近市價</p>

<h3>關於殷歷譜糾譑</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>魯實先敎授近著「殷曆譜糾講」一書，爲駁正中央硏究院歷史語言硏究所硏究員董彥堂（作賓）氏「殷曆譜」而作。董氏此書積思十餘年始成，藝林皆以爲偉業，而傅孟眞（斯年）氏序之，以爲「彥堂之學並世所尊，後生初學若不挺以沽勇，何術自見？此如話本唐僧取經，到處逢怪力亂神，欲獲一臠之割也。必評衡此書之全，則有先決之條件在：一，其人必通習甲骨如彥堂。二，其人必默識歷法如彥堂。三，其人必下幾年功夫。然此絕無之事也。』不謂「絕無之事」，世多有之，姑舉魯君之書爲例。魯君旣爲當代年歷學之權成，兼之淹貫四部，深通金文甲骨之學，故其批判，論證極精，其於董氏所立論之斷代硏究，祀統，祀系，及其所依據之歷術，所斷定之年代，所取證之卜辭，彝器，皆條辨無遺。全書十餘萬言，附古歷表五十有七。蓋純憑客觀之態度，發爲典雅犀利之文章，無一字虛設，無一語游移，綜貫之博，體例之嚴，近三十年來，國學論著中未易多得之作也。</p>
<p>糾　分爲上下二篇。上篇之發端曰：『乙酉仲夏，董氏作賓刊所著股曆譜，列爲十譜，　爲二編，都有十四卷。乃以股曆卜辭部列年歷，積思十載之作也。其於年歷則自盤庚以來，詳具至朔。其於殷契，則自武丁以降，綴集　殘，其年歷賴卜辭以證成，而卜辭馮年歷以編屬。或者以爲殷商禮制，夷狄征誅，得此粲然若編年之史。又或謂董理殘叢，關明幽邃，果若「綴百衲之衣，貫九曲之珠」者，信艱難之大業，藝林之保典矣。柳聞此書編摩之日，即已有聲士林。汗靑斯竟，則皆詫爲偉製。以愚觀之，顧多疑難，用特不避應直，謹陳筦窺。聊冀竅領眞銓，非敢故爲立異。最言大端，厥爲三類，語其名目則日年次無考也，曰殷曆無一徵也，曰卜辭難據也。此雖舉其綱維，榷商大體，然於董書論證，固已巨細兼賅，所謂「評衡此書之全」，要不外是。」觀此，則魯書之內容大綱可見矣。</p>
<p>其上篇之結論曰：『案其全書之例，則年次與應術猶其表蕝，而所取證之卜辭彝器猶其刻漏官序。夫表影欹偏，則漏刻不正；綿蕝旣亂，則朝位多乖。此乃互爲準繩，不容　事微爽。况其三者之義，無論大綱小目，要皆反覆牾違。是其通編主旨，固無片詞可立。徧體鱗傷，難施鍼砭。略通文理，即見其非。審其立論，則由疑蓋之詞翻爲堅證。檢其案據，則揭一家之說施以廖詮。博稽詳考，彼固未能，異說叢稠皆若未覩。藉曰行文貴簡，則其煩冗顧多。如斯論述，本屬糞苴。徒以顓蒙者視爲成理，蛆附者美爲鑿空，以故不惜景光，聊爲詞　。要而言之，凡經緯彝器之年月者無殊畫鬼，其考論卜辭之時代者直類捕風。而乃言之委曲，一若親所見聞；編排月日，詳於歷朝實錄。不知莫須有之定讞未可服人，想當然之故事詎能傳信。而輒自詡堅證，肊斷不疑；屢見篇章，罔知細省。斯則蔽於成見，未可厚非。即其立說觕疏，多陷矛盾，蓋以汗靑倉卒，不克周詳。佗如未　推步，假助疇人，獻功衆手，古有成例，淮南呂覽，義無可訾。全書立論，或有　襲羣言，不標姓氏，殆亦言公之例。若此之類，情俱可原，而佞之渚，以爲「默識」「通習」，贊爲「並世所尊」，斯則　俗　張，理無可恕；質之作者，當不自承。以此陵人，甚可憫笑。且謂人能解蔽，事乃絕無，縣之國門，不可增損。是直　味妄愚，而徒華誣脅衆，不可與言者矣！」可見魯氏之爲此書，乃激於董著之過於「自詡」，傅序之故意「陵人」。論衡何爲？因疾虛妄。胡然胡否，將待定評。原夫傅董二氏之意，似欲樹立學術上絕對之權威，隱然自居學術世界之希墨。治新曆法之劉朝陽敎授旣作殷曆質疑，再論殷曆，三論殷曆於前，治古歷法之魯實先敎授復作「股曆譜糾譑」於後；劉魯二君殆如入羅馬取柏林之盟國統帥乎？是誠學術史上之嘉話也。</p>
<p>糾譑下篇取董氏祖甲六年曆表，以古歷法五十七種推步而比較之。魯君之序論曰：『綴文旣竟，爰取列朝曆術，推步氣朔，厠之下篇，俾窺異同，藉辨得失。其考覈之年，則董氏之所謂祖甲六祀；其甄采之曆，則囊括史志所載之明文。亦有術數未詳，曾經前賢考定，審其無繆，併予臚陳。若乃諸家是正之言，下迨不佞推補之作，則以布在方書，可供考案，爲省縟詞，此不具引。至於鄭元偉張孟賓二曆雖經推補，尙屬存疑。如此之流，槪勿蘭入。壬遁之書，問言歷術，徒見乖尤，不足稱舉。晚明以降私曆頗繁，或式遵舊章，或折衷西法，要皆改易子母，未經實測　離。若斯之類，亦予芟除。其有歷名雖異，法數相同者；亦有同時之曆，餘分稍忒，而氣朔無差者。若唐之五紀，與麟德不殊；明之大統，乃寫授時成策。又若漠之太初，全襲周歷，雖其積年異撰，而氣朔俱同。金之大明，楊級剏法，積年較趙氏爲多，亦以法數相同，故僅朔餘微爽。屬斯類者，第擷一家，等窺二曆。此篇所錄，因不贅陳。其或步算不始於冬至者，則有秦之　頊，宋之元嘉，顓頊起算於立春，蓋其置閏不以無中氣爲準，以其特異諸曆，姑從屛置。元嘉雖以人正雨水起算，而此篇則上溯正冬至入錄。所以整齊畫一者，以便檢校異同也。」觀魯君以列朝曆法較殷曆譜，所以證異同，明得失者，蓋藉純客觀之數度以衡量之，朱知「默識曆法」之董氏將何以置詞也。而「絕無之事」竟有之，傅氏又將何以否認之也？</p>
<p>魯君此書將自付石印，倘出版界有願承印者，魯君願自讓權。魯君謙居「後生初學之」列，隱然以老師宿儒自居之傅董二氏，於魯君此書之出，將有嚴正之指示乎？</p>
<p>余於董譜魯書略示鄙見，具於拙作龜曆歌一長詩者，於茲不贅。</p>
<h3>鎮江之戀</h3>
<p>— 葛尚德</p>
<p>我戀念着鎭江，我戀念着這將近二十年前的舊遊之地的鎭江。</p>
<p>鎭江，在歷史的篇幅上，曾經凝鍊成了多少使人憧憬的故事：漢末處士焦光的隱居焦山；吳大帝的一度建都丹徒；晋時氏俘——苻堅部下——的囚置金山；梁夫人在戰敗元朮之役中的執桴擊鼓；……這些故事，在人們的心頭，勾起了懷古之思。</p>
<p>雄渾的山河和旖旎的風光，爲上述故事中的主角們，綴飾了一個縱横馳騁或遨遊隱逸的舞臺；同時，這雄渾的山河，這旖旎的風光，也正是爲我們，爲我們子孫，永遠地永遠地支持着驕矜和高傲。</p>
<p>在一個並不十分短暫的鎭江生活的時期中，我自信確曾探摸到了鎭江的偉大和崇高的靈魂。</p>
<p>正有不少不少的黄昏，我抽暇踅到城北的北固山巓，去周詳的巡視，去凝神的遙望，去靜穆的觀書。那相傳是孫夫人梳粧的樓臺，那相傳是劉玄德試劍的石塊，那相傳是玄德和孫仲謀駛馬的坡道，那相傳是孫夫人投江處的望江亭，散佈在山腰和山巓，令人緬想起古代英雄們的活躍的姿態。在一個大雪之後的傍晚，我倚在望江亭中，閱讀着屠格湼夫的羅亭，有時也把視綫悠然地注向對江皚皚的白雪。</p>
<p>正有不少不少的假日，我買棹去遊玩江心的焦山。想像着這正是焦處士印下踪跡的泥土，同時抬頭望着滔滔江水東流——眼前不自覺地又浮現出了一幅安國夫人執桴繫鼓的畫面。</p>
<p>正有不少不少的日子，我從很遠的寓所跑到金山之巓。於此我體味到了當年我全民族擊敗苻堅囚置氐俘的光榮勝利；我傲然地向着山河長嘯。</p>
<p>正有不少不少的時光，我獨自跑到鎭江的南郊，在那山崗起伏間的羊腸小徑上踽踽漫步。一邊看着書，一邊也常蹲身摘取路畔的小花夾入書中。那些書，我還淸楚地記得是莫泊桑的短篇小說之類。</p>
<p>時間的浪濤儘管向湧，轉瞬間已是蕩浟了將近二十年的歲月；但始終不能磨蝕我心中的印象——那舊遊之地的鎭江所遺給我的深刻的印象。</p>
<p>鎭江，是古代」首瑰麗詩是現代一首瑰麗的詩，也是未來一首瑰麗的詩。</p>
<p>我　念着鎭江，我以最大的熱忱爲鎭江歌頌。</p>
<h3>畫家之妻</h3>
<p>— 卡卡索</p>
<p>卞卡索（Pablo　Picasso　1881-）是立體主義的首創者，也是現代歐洲畫壇的領導人。一般人祗知其爲立體派的作家，不料在一九三八年的沙龍裏竟發現了這機一張極其古典作風的肖像，使人感到異常的驚奇，於是「沒有素描基礎」這類荒謬的批評就此搽除了。這也就是說明了，卞卡索不是不會這樣惟妙惟肖的畫，而是不願這樣浪費他寳貴的時間罷了。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>我家的桂花文學</h3>
<p>— 查猛濟</p>
<p>西洋文學上象徵勝利的”桂花，常常看見在詩人的篇章裏不絕地稱道。講到中國的「桂花」，究竟是不是和月桂花一個統系，我雖不曾確切考據，但是論它的色香氣味，也可算是上品的種性。</p>
<p>從前科舉時代，很普遍地用這種花來比　淸貴的科甲。所謂「獨占鰲頭」的「狀元」，帽子上面總要插着兩朶金花。金色就是「桂花」的本色，這樣說來，和西洋「月桂冠」這個名詞的意義，又是相差不連。</p>
<p>我們姓査的在海寗，凡是念書的人家，至今大多還保留着一兩枝桂花。我家的桂樹歷史，聽老輩說來，更是非常奇怪。據說我們的上代，遇到有一次要產生「秀才」以上「舉人」「進士」之類的人物，那花枝在這個秋天總是發得格外茂盛。有一個連年不第的落魄書生，到我家來偸折一枝「桂花」回去，而那年居然「放徬」的；於是我家的「桂花」，便成爲文塲的妙樹。初白老人查愼行，在他所著的「敬業堂詩集」裘，也屢次提及「桂花」的名字。他的「留別潤木即次弟送別原韻」詩，有一首云：</p>
<p>「指點林廬眺望賒，曉隨門鵲暮褄鴉。桐爲先世成陰樹，桂是吾家及第花。屋後籬疏須補竹，牆西地瘠想宜茶，得歸已乏躬耕力，種植書中課有加』。</p>
<p>這首詩中有兩條自注，我現在也把它札在下而：</p>
<p>（一）「池上梧桐，先君子手植，二十年前已合抱。宋人稱韓子華兄弟爲桐樹韓家』。</p>
<p>（二）『吾家　事前銀桂五株，自癸酉以來，每逢科詔，兄弟子侄輩有獲雋者，必發金花一枝爲先兆，歷歷不爽』。</p>
<p>這詩題中所稱「潤木」，就是初白老人的弟弟嗣庭，淸代文字獄中著名的人物。所稱「次弟」，就是第二個弟弟嗣　，又字德尹。他有「爲德尹題査浦書屋圖」詩云：</p>
<p>「兩　斜日過牆　，課罷頻看桂影移；此樹年來生意盡，可堪頭白話兒時』？</p>
<p>這首詩也有一段自註的話；</p>
<p>「廳事東偏小齋，余與弟幼時讀書處也。　庭有老桂一本，每視樹影上牆，爲放學之候，</p>
<p>今桂已爲薪矣」。</p>
<p>又「德尹假出都志別」詩中有云：</p>
<p>『植桂移松已兩年，家書頻寄問西阡。洛陽二頃談何易？稍喜躬耕有墓田」。</p>
<p>他時時說到桂花，也時時從桂花身上反映出自己變遷的人生。我把這派「桂花文學」介紹給讀者，附帶吿訴大家：科舉跟着時代潮流而沒落以後，「桂花」的價値並不受到什麽影響，現在吾們鄕間的老婆婆，對於「桂花」，還是依舊崇拜，桂花的盛衰足以預測家道興替的傳說，至今還夾着風水占卜由「桂花文學」一變爲「桂花哲學」，而流行在「桂子飄香」的村莊。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　385</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>耀羣這裏，還在打着磨旋，只聽得擘空傳來一聲又尖又脆的呼嘯，正是小老虎的信號；那呼嘯的聲響，撞在兩邊山壁上，起了循環的回聲，好像滿山谷滿，都有人打着同樣呼嘯一般，吁吁不絕，刺人耳鼓。耀羣一聽這聲信號，心下忽然悟到，必是老寨得了二人回來消息，着人迎了出來，凑巧被小老虎碰了個正着，於是又同着來人，一起馳驟而來。想到這裏，心下一高興，立又鬆了　頭，放馬奔去；同時也　嘴一聲長噓，答覆了小老虎的信號。</p>
<p>這兩方面對跑的脚程，都如狂風驟雨，威勢率度，都表現到了頂點；所以那麼長一段距離，不多一會，眼望就要碰頭了。雙方跑得愈近，耀　當然看得愈加淸楚；早經證實了自己所料不差。對方人馬，從遠處看，因直綫掩蔽了前後地位關係，以為幾匹馬都是首尾啣接跑着。比及跑得近了，才看得出那頭一騎與二三騎之間，相差着很長一段。</p>
<p>耀羣看看來騎距離不遠，若莫有二三十丈左右，便把縱繩輕輕勒了一勒，預備收住勢子，誰知對方那第一騎，也是一樣心思，不過出手更快，早把勢子勒住那馬只後蹄着地，前半身子，一起一落，只在當地打着磨旋。</p>
<p>「呈…紀姨」！小老虎呼嘯一聲，喊着耀羣。</p>
<p>一嘿…」耀羣一邊緩下冲勢，一邊答應着。「是哪幾位」？她急於想知道來人是誰。</p>
<p>耀羣語聲未華，馬已跑得離小老虎近了。小老虎的答語還未聽眞，只見那後面的兩騎，已先後到了小老虎身邊；馬的衝勢還未完全殺住，人已早從馬背躍下，跟着跑了幾步，齊往路側一站：</p>
<p>「大姑娘，您好？…」一個大喇叭式的寬嗓子，首先招呼耀羣了：「給您請安…！寨裏早得了信，知道您二位榮…榮…榮歸哪」！這「榮歸」二字，大槪現販現賣，一時上口，還不怎麽流所。</p>
<p>「嗐…老能嗎」？耀羣離着來人，只有二丈來遠了。「那一位可是武二爺？……」來人沒有開口，月光底下，看不分明，耀羣只這們猜査。</p>

<h3>有色人種</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>沈崇案我外部將正式抗議，希望能獲得「公正」的答覆。　美國白種人遭黑人强姦的，立處死刑，而美國白種水兵在中國强姦中國女人，却判處一罪。</p>
<p>但美國·英國人歧視有色人種是天下聞名的。蕭乾的「人生採訪」中，作者在英倫遇見一個秘密神女，因爲作者是黃種人，連那個神女都放棄了她的這門生意。</p>
<p>而約翰根寳的「美國內幕」，更把美國人虐待黑人的眞相和盤托出，他說：</p>
<p>『第二次世界天戰結束前不久，有人問一個黑女郞打算怎樣懲罰希特勒，她回答說：「把他塗黑了，再把他帶到這裏來」。」（美國黑種人和白種人是隔離的（</p>
<p>又說有兩個年靑的黑人，有侵入一個白種女人房屋的「嫌疑」，結果因罪嫌不足而獲釋放。但是這兩個黑人却被一羣身份不明的人捕去，用殘酷的刑罰將他們處死；一個斫去雙手，並用焊鐵管燒灼頭部及全身致死；另一個受重傷，僥倖尙未殞命。</p>
<p>這案件結果並無下文，也無人追究。</p>
<p>美國一共有一千三百萬黑種人，在肉體上，精神上受着白種人的虐待。</p>
<p>無怪美國水兵强姦了我們堂堂的北大女生，也竟能從輕發落，認爲罪嫌不足，而判處無罪了。</p>
<p>但是中國人並不是美國黑人區域里的奴隷，他是曾經與他駢肩作戰，反抗暴力戰爭的盟友呵！</p>

<h3>匡矑浮雕</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>當你迎着突然來臨的山雨，坐在肩輿上，走着崎嶇蜿蜒的坡道，左灣見一峯右灣逢一谷的時候，你可能有一種想烤雞：「這些山巒也許不會有止境了」。因爲在你看來已經沒有路而且沒有人烟的際會，牠很可能立則登上了一段平夷之路，而峯迴路轉，綠樹掩映裏，幾許紅瓦，你不會覺得也許此身已經羽化登仙？</p>
<p>但是正在你覺得兩峯相峙，坦道其中的當兒，忽然又是一個陡坡而上，一邊是削壁千仞，一邊是下臨塘地，這時松風呼吼奇　嘶鳴，你又怎能不有膽戰心驚之悠？尤其是當你正視前途時，雲從脚底起，白炤似的騰空而起，立刻掩沒了萬壑千峯，但是，短時只一二分鐘，長時也不過五分至十分鐘，這一陣雲霧會立即散去，眼前是一片開朗，如果你曾經到過廬山，你就會曉得那在山腰裏看雲霧蔽天的奇景，同時你也曾欣賞到山巔俯視雲霧去後的秀麗湖光。廬山自古以來，給人以夢樣的感覺，給八以迷樣的情趣。東坡昔年詠廬山，就有過這樣的名句：「橫看成嶺側成峯，到處看山山不同，不識廬山眞面目，只緣身在此山中。」到今天爲止，我們搜集不到一本敍述廬山眞面目的册子，就足以說明　，廬山是一個謎。</p>
<p>廬山爲什麼是一個謎，爲什麼有突然而來的雲？又有驅之不去的霧？最大的原因是他依江傍湖，得江湖之會。揚子江的浩瀚，鄱陽湖的秀麗，把雄偉奇突的廬山烘托在烟雨飄渺裏了。</p>
<p>廬山最高峯有一五四三公尺名大漢陽峯，有人說，登大漢陽峯，環視諸峯就是爲廬山主峯的五老峯也有俯伏之勢。大漢陽峯的高度和泰山最高處相等，峯巔平曠，　喬木，向下望去，荒烟浩渺、眞所謂窈不見底，因其地過高，很少沒有雲霧的際會，所以登臨　頂，極目四望，則長江的水和彭蠡的烟，會合而爲雲霧，若隱若現，氣勢萬千。傳聞如果能在晴朗的日子往遊，可以遠眺漢陽烟樹。同時在峯前有一崖，名禺王崖，傳說是夏禹王治水時，，登此崖，不過這自然是一種推測之詞。</p>
<p>關於廬山的主峯五老峯本來是出於一山，其間相距一里半里不等，五峯同具奇峻，第三峯頂有「日近雲低」的石刻，可見登峯頂後的氣勢。有形容的詞句「履觸雲生處，身齊飛烏上」實在寫實的句子。五老峯下有五小峯，還有五老洞，都是廬山勝境，可惜是險峻異常，而且傳聞猛獸出沒無常，所以抵牯嶺的遊客、很少往遊五老峯。</p>
<p>在山峯而外蔚爲奇觀的是各種瀑布，如玉淵，三級泉，靑玉峽，玉簾泉，谷簾泉，王家坡瀑布，石門　瀑布等等，都各有其州雄偉奇趣。但是，記者終沒有能親自一遊，只是聽老　山像描寫神奇小說的吿訴你。比如三級泉，是怎樣在五老峯的背後出來，只見一縷白泉如練，潺潺而下，形同奔馬，聲勢宏大，這是第一疊，在磐石以下為第二疊，再下爲三疊，共長達千二百尺。曾經有遊客於登臨眺望之際，忽然在風大作，被捲入潭中，以致喪生。又如谷簾泉，　爲天下第一，尤其是　　第一觀，其奇觀處，在於泉出源後，散落成數十百縷，分列如玉簾，遠遠看去，自有特別風味。</p>
<p>廬山是一座神奇的山，記者入山方四日，自然不識奧妙，但是晨起推窗，正是雲漫山谷，而响午却滿峯都是金光輝煌，入晚，陽光晦　說不定風起雲湧，片刻之間就來了大風雨，到得夜來，松濤和泉流的交響，奏着節奏而悲壯的曲十，這些就已足够你領會出廬山的神奇和謎樣的情趣了。我不能了解牠，可是入得山來，我起碼是可以體會他了。（八月十二日）</p>

<p>你聽到「失業局」Unenp　loyment　Eoard這個詞定感到非常驀生，但是也一定感到非常有趣，再聽到失業的人每月可領八十元美金的失業津貼，一定感到驚奇，失了業有八十元美金一月的收入。比中國不失業的大學敎授富麗得多了。中國沒失業局，祗有什麽職業介紹所，介紹職業是一種義務，成功與否却恕不負責、倘在介紹到職業之前面活活的餓死了，那是活該，美國失業局的作風就大不相同了，那個局把人民失業的責任放在政府的頭上眞所謂百姓失業罪在朕躬，（這句子是筆者胡謅的，四書五經沒有說過）因爲人民盡了納稅的義務，政府就得給人民解決生活，這就引出了貨眞價實的民生問題來了，失業局是任何縣份都有的，在失業局的門首榜示人才待聘的吿白，在當地報紙上也經常有人才待聘的廣吿，凡是失了業的人，向失業局登記即可按月支取津貼八十元美金，領到找着工作為止，但是如果他們介紹你適當的工作，而你偸懶不去上工，被他們査出，你的津貼就再　不到了。美國人喜歡做事、不想領乾　、所以一找到工作，就不再領津貼，這種制度祇能在美國行得通，第一，各機關公司商店需要人才時，向來不由主管人員把娘舅外甥拉進去，就是沒有任何私人的惡習，所有失業局的人才僅有出路；第二，美國新興的事業很多，需要大批人才，因此失業局反而有人才不敷之嘆，有大宗的失業津貼，而沒有足額的失業者來領取；第三，美國人富於自食其力的精神，甘願失業而坐領現成津貼的人頗爲不多，除老殘病非靠津貼生活不可外，有工作本領的，寗可工作面拿七十九元，決不閑散而拿八十元，八十元美金按黑市計算差不多要値法幣四百萬元，可以夜夜白相跳無塲了。如果中國也有失業局發放津貼的話，中國失業的人一定，要增加。失業局是一種賠本生意，美國人講究生意經，小爲什麽一定要做這賠本生意呢？他們賠了這一筆小還的本錢，却杜絕了一般因朱業以致挺而走險的人，這是做一筆賠本的小生意來保障大生意的　法。試問社會不安定，你發得到和平財嗎？美國已沒有國難，所以國難財是發不成了、美國人的長處是目光遠火，肯化本錢，像租借法案那筆大本錢，世界上祇有美國人肯化，到底換來了各國的市塲，你說他是大傻瓜，你才是大傻瓜呢？美國人平時化五分錢請你吃一瓶可口可樂，也要秤秤五分錢的分量，你想他是傻瓜嗎？失業局是一個聰的設施。值得採行的。（四三）</p>

<h3>Adjusting County-Level Institutional Finances, Carefully Selecting and Rigorously Examining County-Level Personnel: The Executive Yuan Reaffirms Prior Order and Circulars for Compliance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan recently issued a circular to various ministries, commissions, and provincial governments, regarding adjusting county-level institutional finances, reducing concurrent posts and constraints of county magistrates, and carefully selecting and rigorously examining county-level personnel. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The nation is in the aftermath of a protracted war of resistance, compounded by the rebellion of the communist bandits. Local areas are in extreme chaos and destitution. The key to governance lies in sorting out and rectifying the situation, focusing on ways to promote recovery and education. Local administrative institutions should strive for rationality and compactness, local construction funds should be earmarked for specific purposes, and the quality of officials should aim for competence. Only when objective conditions are largely met can local politics be effective. If we continue to adhere to old ways and be constrained by the status quo, failing to adapt to changing circumstances, how can we satisfy the people's hope for recovery and establish the foundation for local autonomy? In May of the 35th year [1946], this Yuan, following the Chairman's handwritten instructions and the order from the Executive Yuan (Fu Jiao Jing) on May 11th, dispatched instruction No. 1659 of Jing Jia Ding to all provincial governments, ordering them to seek to enrich local tax revenues to solve the financial difficulties at the county level and to adjust county-level institutions based on local financial conditions. Furthermore, regarding respecting the authority of county magistrates and reducing their concurrent posts, the central government has repeatedly formulated measures and issued circulars for compliance, all on record. Recently, at an administrative symposium, many provincial chairmen still cited the excessive size of county-level institutions, the difficulty in raising funds, the scarcity of talent, and the lack of exclusive authority and excessive constraints of county magistrates. This indicates that the previous orders issued by the central government have not been effectively implemented in many localities. We hereby reaffirm the previous orders and provide detailed regulations as follows:</p>
<p>I. Regarding streamlining county-level institutions: A review of the organizational outlines for counties at all levels reveals that while the various departments and offices of the county government are listed comprehensively, it was clarified that the number of departments should be determined by each provincial government based on the county's grade and actual needs, and it was not rigidly stipulated that all must be uniformly established. However, in reality, most counties have universally established all the units listed in the outline, and quite a few have successively added units beyond those stipulated in the outline, resulting in bloated organizations and excessive waste. Provincial governments should re-evaluate the county's grade, financial surplus, and actual needs, and determine the organization of each county government, with a maximum limit of five departments and two offices (from the secretary to the accounting office) and a minimum of three departments and one office (the accounting director attached to the secretary's office) (remote, particularly small counties with limited funds and simple matters are exempt). This will prevent excessive disparity in the organization of each county, and expenses can be largely self-sufficient. The departments should be renamed with first and second ordinal numbers to allow for the allocation of their responsibilities based on the complexity of the matters. All other originally established units such as statistics, cooperation, guidance, land registration, organization, weights and measures verification, etc., should retain necessary personnel and assign them to work in departments and offices of similar nature, under the supervision and direction of the heads of those departments and offices, to carry out their specialized duties. Provincial governments are required to comply with and properly plan within one month of receiving this document, supervise and instruct each county to effectively adjust, and report the newly determined organizational regulations of each county government to the Yuan for record. This time, the compulsory streamlining is due to local financial difficulties, the inability to improve salaries, and the lack of development in undertakings. We must strive to economize to promote revitalization. Once local finances are rectified and sufficient, and autonomous undertakings are gradually developed, if there is a need to moderately increase units and expand the organization, it can still be submitted to the provincial government for approval after being passed by the representative bodies. The overall aim is to vigorously implement streamlining to reverse the current decline, and not to prolong simplicity and frugality, which would hinder future development.</p>
<h3>Increasing Allocation of Local Tax Sources, Strictly Prohibiting Arbitrary Apportionment, Reducing Concurrent Posts of County Magistrates to Focus on Responsibilities</h3>
<p>II. Regarding adjusting county-level finances: Since the amendment of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system law, county-level finances have had broader tax sources than before, such as allocating half of the land tax, allocating all of the deed tax, and allocating most of the business tax to local areas. However, due to the failure to earnestly collect taxes, the tax rates are not very appropriate, and the amount of revenue is not as expected. Moreover, provincial governments often exercise excessive control over county-level finances, resulting in many counties being unable to be self-sufficient. The central government should appropriately increase the allocated tax sources, such as the native tobacco tax and native wine tax, and appropriately adjust the tax rates, such as the slaughter tax, banquet tax, entertainment tax, vehicle license tax, business license tax, and house tax. The Executive Yuan is instructing the Ministry of Finance to quickly deliberate and submit them for approval. Once the draft laws are completed, they will be issued for implementation. Land tax is a major source of local revenue. Provincial governments should immediately order the competent authorities and commissioners of each district to supervise and instruct their subordinate counties to effectively organize and clarify the tax registers, inspect concealments, improve tax collection, and eliminate corruption. Commissioners should be stationed in each county under their jurisdiction to oversee the clarification and ensure that public school property funds are used for public purposes. Those with insufficient ordinary tax sources but substantial yields from special products can levy special taxes in accordance with item 10 of Annex (1) 2 of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system law, such as animal husbandry in the northwest, marine products in the southeast, medicinal materials in mountain areas, and special crops. This can both provide resources for the people's livelihood and serve as a source of taxation for the government. However, it should not violate central tax laws and regulations or hinder national economic development, and it must be approved by the county council and the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. In reviewing county taxes and county budgets, provincial governments should pay attention to the actual needs and the opinions of representative bodies, and should not excessively restrict the rational development of local county-level politics. However, arbitrary apportionment in various localities should be absolutely prohibited. Provincial governments should determine the steps for rectification and effectively implement them within one month of receiving this document, and report the progress of the rectification monthly for record.</p>
<p>III. Regarding reducing the concurrent posts of county magistrates: The county magistrate is an official close to the people, governing a territory of hundreds of miles, and is responsible for everything. All measures must be carefully considered and personally inspected. The complexity of the affairs and the magnitude of the responsibilities are vastly different from those of the heads of ordinary agencies. Unless we alleviate the burden of their side duties and focus their minds, enabling them to devote their full efforts, it will be difficult to fulfill their duties. Given the current situation, county magistrates hold numerous concurrent posts, and it is difficult to manage everything at once. Either they are spread too thin and become ineffective, or they are forced to prioritize secondary matters over primary ones. The poor state of county administration in recent years is also a major cause. Since the 29th year [1940], this Yuan has repeatedly issued circulars to adjust the situation, but a review of the concurrent posts of county magistrates still reveals as many as ten or more. If we do not clearly state the principles and supervise the effective simplification, how can we focus the responsibility of the county magistrate and promote the development of county administration? It is stipulated that if the posts that county magistrates are legally required to hold concurrently are, in fact, unnecessary, the relevant laws and regulations should be reviewed and fundamentally corrected. If the laws and regulations are issued by the central government, they should be reviewed and amended by the central competent ministries and commissions. If the laws and regulations are issued by the local government, they should be reviewed and amended by the provincial government. If the matters can be handled by the various departments and offices of the county government without the need to establish separate agencies, they should be abolished immediately. Only if the matters cannot be merged and the laws cannot be changed can the county magistrate be required to continue to hold them concurrently. This strict approach is only intended to reduce the number of concurrent posts, so that the county magistrate can focus on their primary duties, and the progress of local politics can be expected.</p>
<h3>No Orders to Be Issued to Counties Except by Designated Superiors</h3>
<p>IV. Regarding restricting direct command of county magistrates: The county magistrate is responsible to the provincial government above and governs the townships below. All land, people, and affairs within the jurisdiction are under the control of the county magistrate alone. Their responsibility is heavy and their power should be exclusive. However, senior agencies or garrison commanders of other departments, in order to facilitate their own work, often entrust matters that are not within their jurisdiction to the county magistrate and directly issue orders to supervise them. This not only increases the burden but also undermines their authority. The National Government promulgated temporary measures for central agencies and troops to use documents and orders to county governments in February of the 31st year [1942] and issued circulars for implementation. The measures stipulated that except for (1) officers above the rank of general in the war zone or garrison area, regarding emergency situations in combat, (2) garrison commanders, martial law commanders, and pacification directors in the garrison area, martial law area, or pacification area, regarding garrison, martial law, and pacification military operations, and (3) provincial air defense commanders, regarding air defense emergencies, who may directly issue orders to the county governments within their respective areas, any other agency or troop that requires the county government to handle matters should have the provincial government forward the orders for compliance and should not directly issue orders. Those who arbitrarily issue orders to the county government will be dealt with separately by the competent higher-level agency. Although the central government's regulations are quite strict, the local implementation is not very effective. Those who are not in the direct command system still issue orders to the county magistrate, which is very common and must be corrected. Provincial governments are responsible for considering the situation of each county and district and listing the agencies that should be directly commanded, informing the relevant county governments and instructing each county government to immediately report to the provincial government any agency without direct command authority that arbitrarily issues orders to them, and the provincial government is responsible for forwarding the report to the competent higher-level agency for punishment. Only in this way will the county magistrate with heavy responsibilities not be unfairly oppressed, and only in this way will the agencies that arbitrarily issue orders have some scruples. The provincial government must take more responsibility for the implementation of central laws and regulations and the protection of the authority of the county magistrate. We hope that the provincial chairmen will strive to do so.</p>
<p>V. Regarding the selection and examination of county-level officials: Now that county-level institutions have been streamlined, finances have been rectified, and county magistrates are no longer holding multiple concurrent posts, it can be said that the objective conditions for work are largely in place. If we can obtain sound assistants to work together, the efficiency of county administration can be greatly improved. Looking at the current situation of county-level personnel, due to the low salaries and the lack of talent, people are often recruited locally to fill positions inadequately. Before appointment, there is no thorough selection and training. After appointment, there is no rigorous assessment of rewards and punishments. As a result, greedy and incompetent people can also embark on official careers, and corruption and bribery become commonplace. After this streamlining of institutions and rectification of finances, the number of personnel will be reduced, making it easier to recruit talent. With sufficient funds, it will be easier to promote integrity. Provincial governments should immediately supervise and instruct each county magistrate to take advantage of this opportunity for reform to effectively streamline their subordinates, reward integrity and punish corruption, and remove the inferior and retain the superior. In the future, the selection, training, assessment, reward, and punishment of county-level officials should be strictly handled in accordance with the law, so that greedy and incompetent people are eliminated from public service, and those who are both moral and competent are given official positions. Only then will it be easier to obtain talented people for governance and achieve results, and only then will it be possible to transform social customs and renew local politics.</p>
<p>The situation is difficult, and local difficulties are even greater. The people are eagerly awaiting good governance, and the nation is about to implement constitutional government. All matters that should be promoted and reformed must be done promptly and without delay. The five points listed above are the basic conditions for improving county administration. Otherwise, with exhausted funds and bloated staff, with heavy tasks and divided powers, how can we expect achievements and even talk about construction? We hope that the provincial governments will truly understand this, and the county governments will deeply reflect on it. The central ministries and commissions should also understand the principle of internal and external cooperation and the unity of the upper and lower levels, and assist the development of local politics to the extent permitted by laws and regulations. We must ensure that all that is covered by this order can be quickly and thoroughly implemented. The benefits to the future of the nation will be immeasurable. In addition to issuing separate orders, this urgent order is issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Members Li Shijun and Others Inspect the Resources Commission</h3>
<p>Weng Wenhao Explains the Situation of Governance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Supervisory Committee members Li Shijun, Zhang Lu, Yang Naixuan, and others visited the Resources Commission at 10:00 AM on the 25th to inspect the situation of governance. They were first received by the Chairman of the Commission, Weng Wenhao, who gave a general explanation of the organization of the Commission and the overview of the facilities of its affiliated enterprises. Then, the Chief Secretary of the Commission, Wu Zhaohong, together with the heads of various departments, reported on the current situation of various undertakings. Subsequently, Committee Member Li and others raised several questions, including (1) the situation of the Soviet Union dismantling industrial and mining equipment in the Northeast, (2) the situation of the communist bandits destroying industrial and mining equipment, and (3) the actual situation of the enterprises designated by the Executive Yuan to be sold to private ownership by the Resources Commission. Wu gave detailed answers and provided written materials to Committee Member Li and others.</p>
<h3>Cause of Missing Airliner Possibly Due to Weather Conditions: Air Force Headquarters Releases Search Process</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Air Transport Brigade C-47, No. 257, Landi airliner, flew out of Dihua on July 30th and arrived safely in Hami on the same day. The next day, it went missing en route to Jiayuguan, and its whereabouts are still unknown. The Air Force Headquarters has released the search process and the list of personnel on board as follows:</p>
<p>Missing Incident: C-47, No. 257, carrying 21 passengers, took off from Dihua at 9:11 AM on July 30th and arrived safely in Hami at 11:30 AM on the same day. It then took off from Hami at 2:50 PM on July 31st to Jiayuguan. After takeoff, the aircraft maintained contact with the Air Force Jiayuguan radio station, and the communication was very good. At 4:50 PM, the communication suddenly broke off, and the Air Force Hami, Jiayuguan, and Lanzhou radio stations called for a long time. At 6:40 PM, the aircraft was still missing.</p>
<p>Possible Cause of Missing: On that day, the weather in Hami, Anxi, Jiayuguan, Zhangye, and Lanzhou suddenly turned bad after 4:00 PM. The cloud height dropped to below 1,000 feet, the visibility was within one mile, and it was snowing. The cause of the aircraft's disappearance may be due to the influence of the temperature airflow formed by the sudden change in local weather at the junction of the desert and mountainous areas, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. Other possible causes, such as a sudden malfunction of the aircraft's parts, could also cause the aircraft to lose control. However, the exact cause cannot be determined until the wreckage of the aircraft is found.</p>
<p>Search and Rescue Details: After the aircraft was declared missing, the Air Force Jiayuguan station notified the Lanzhou Commissioner's Office and the local garrison commander, asking them to forward the message to the county, township, and Baojia [local administrative units] and the local garrison to mobilize and search for the aircraft. Based on the information obtained from various sources, the areas where the accident may have occurred were systematically searched. After three weeks of continuous efforts in the air and on the ground, there were still no results. In addition to continuing the search in the air and on the ground, the Headquarters will first announce the details of the incident and the list of personnel on board: (1) List of crew members: Pilot Liu Yilu, Co-pilot Zhao Haiquan, Communicator Deng Yougen, Mechanic Xu Huixun. (2) Passenger list: Kong Xianhui, Section Chief of the 16th Air Force Station, and his wife Li Jingzhen, and one child, Air Force Future Warrior Li Zengyu, Yanci Radio Station Chief Li Liangde, Sergeants Zhao Liancheng, Wang Desheng, Kou Guanying, Foreman Zhang Mengchu, Air Force Special Company Commander Shi Xuemeng, Air Force Special Company Adjutant Chen Lixiang, Sergeant Liu Weixian, Wen Shunan (female), family member of the 9th Branch School Training Class, Qiu Zhili of the Garrison Headquarters, Han Heran, Xie Yongcun, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Department, Lei Yingyi of the Tenth Regiment of the China Training Corps, Wen Youlan (female), student of Tianshan Normal School, Lu Chenying, staff member of the Women's Education Department of Tianshan Normal School, Reporter Sha Linxin, American reporter Stephen (female).</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in the Northeast To Be Officially Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Today, the reporter specifically interviewed the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense regarding the reorganization of the Northeast Headquarters and the transfer of senior generals in that area to inquire about the details. According to the spokesperson, the reorganization of the Northeast Headquarters is indeed a fact, but the personnel transfer will be officially announced by the government soon. The various rumors circulating outside are purely speculative and do not correspond to the facts.</p>
<h3>The Hebei, Ping, and Tianjin Workers' Association Sends Another Telegram to the Central Government To Prevent the Smuggling and Dumping of Japanese Goods and That The Dismantling of Japanese Industrial Equipment Must Not Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Hebei, Ping, and Tianjin Workers' Association, sent another telegram on the 23rd regarding the issue of opening trade with Japan to the Chairman and the heads of various Yuan and ministries of the central government, stating that recently, smuggled Japanese goods have been found in large quantities on the market. The resurgence of aggression has already begun with its vanguard. The Japanese are acting unscrupulously, and the Eastern barbarians are engaging in many tricks. Once trade with Japan is officially opened, the trend of smuggling and dumping will inevitably become even more rampant than before the war, and it will be impossible to prevent. We must not ignore this, and dismantling their textile industrial equipment is a fundamental solution that should not be tolerated or delayed. As for their chemical industry, the main target should be the soda ash manufacturing industry. Currently, Japan's equipment has a large surplus beyond maintaining its production level before 1935. Moreover, Japan's raw materials for alkali production, salt, must be supplied by our country. However, our salt industry has been devastated by their destruction during the occupation, and production has sharply declined. From the standpoint of establishing China's basic chemical industry, we have the right to demand the dismantling of Japanese salt factories as compensation for the losses of our salt industry. Furthermore, Japanese rayon factories were absolutely necessary military industries during the war and should originally be on the list of prohibitions. Even in terms of burnt salt, the main chemical used in Japanese rayon production, its production volume should be limited according to the level before 1935, so the equipment of its rayon factories must also be largely abandoned. China needs rayon, but domestic supply is lacking. The existing Japanese rayon factories should also be dismantled and moved to China, so that our supply and demand can be balanced.</p>
<h3>Scope of Authority of Military Police and Police Has Been Drafted by the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>To Be Promulgated After Approval by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the measures for adjusting the authority of military police and police, according to reporter investigations, the existing laws and regulations will be reiterated, and the scope of authority of military police and police will be clearly defined. The main points are as follows: The police will be fully responsible for handling general public security issues, and the military police must not overstep their authority. Military police should carry out punishments for violations of public security by military personnel, and the police must not interfere. If the military police investigate general public security order and need to handle it, they should immediately notify the local police to carry out the punishment, and the military police must not overstep their authority. Conversely, if the police discover that military personnel are violating public security order, they should immediately request the local military police to enforce the law, and the police must not interfere. If there are no military police stationed in the area, the police may act on behalf of the military police. In areas where no police have been set up, the military police may also act on behalf of the police. The above measures have been drafted by the competent authorities of the Ministry of Interior and will be jointly signed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being promulgated.</p>

<h3>Wei Envoy Flies to Korea Today for Inspection That the Mission Had Gathered at MacArthur's Headquarters and Wei Has Obtained an Outline of the Situation in Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] U.S. President's Special Envoy General Wedemeyer and members of his fact-finding mission began collecting information on South Korea from MacArthur's headquarters on the 25th. The working methods of the mission in Tokyo are the same as in China. At noon on the 25th, Wei had lunch with Lieutenant General Eichelberger, Commander of the Eighth Army, in Yokohama, and had dinner with MacArthur in the evening, accompanied by his liaison advisor Watson. Wei will fly to Seoul at 9:30 AM on the 26th. It is reported that Wei has obtained the issues of the Korean occupation area, and has also obtained an image of the opinions of the Allied Headquarters on the broad political situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Wei's experts met with headquarters officials to discuss the military, political, and economic problems of South Korea. South Korea is under MacArthur's command, and Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea, recently condemned the Soviet Union's representatives in the U.S. and Soviet Joint Commission for encouraging North Korean politicians to promote illegal activities in the U.S. occupied areas. After inspecting South Korea for eight or ten days, Wei will travel to Hawaii via Tokyo, where he will merge the Chinese and Korean reports into one and make recommendations to President Truman.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng Discusses Wei's Statement Believes It is Constructive Criticism</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, told a United Press reporter on the 25th: "Special Envoy Wei's farewell message is of great value to us, because from this, we can use other people's observations of us as a mirror." Wu continued, "We accept the spirit of Wei's criticism and recognize this as constructive criticism from a well-intentioned friend. We will do our best to remedy our shortcomings. However, the problem of the Chinese Communists is a major factor hindering the National Government from implementing reforms and construction. We certainly pray that the Chinese Communists will lay down their arms and cooperate for the benefit of the people, but our experience shows that the possibility of this hope being realized is very small. Communist ideology is a malignant tumor that cannot be cured without excision. The Chinese government has a responsibility to the people to quell the communist rebellion, so that our people can enjoy peace and the construction of the country can proceed smoothly. We do not use the communist crisis as an excuse not to improve ourselves, but the war against the communists is a great burden on our country's devastated vitality. The sooner the communist rebellion is quelled, the faster China's recovery will be."</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 25th] The Communist Party's "Pravda" newspaper stated today that the United States has repeatedly sent presidential special envoys to China, usually limited to military leaders, which is well known. The real goal of the Wedemeyer mission is definitely not purely fact-finding.</p>
<h3>Reporting Corruption</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Circulars to All Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan recently, in order to rectify the customs of various localities and eradicate corruption, recently issued circulars to the governments of various provinces and cities, encouraging the reporting of corruption and rewarding informants. The names of informants will be kept as confidential as possible in order to thoroughly eradicate corruption.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Troops Invade Beitashan Again Launching a "Cattle Charge" Assault Repelled by Our Forces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Correspondent Stationed in Qitai, Urgent Telegram from Beitashan, 24th] (Delayed) Last night, a team of Mongolian troops of about fifty people launched an attack on our Huzhierte outpost at the northern foot of Beitashan in a mix of rain, snow, and hail. The Mongolian troops fought like a "cattle charge," swarming forward. When the hail was at its fiercest, the gunfire was also at its densest. The attacking Mongolian troops were suppressed by our army's firepower. In recent days, the Mongolian army's rear has been very active. Every day, five or six trucks transport troops to the front line, as preparation for a major battle. At 9:00 PM on the 23rd, more than 30 Mongolian troops also took advantage of the thick fog to attack the Usman troops and were repelled. It is generally judged that the Mongolian troops seem to be probing our main force in order to launch a large-scale attack.</p>
<h3>Vice Chairman Sun Arrives in Guangzhou, All Circles to Hold Welcome Meeting This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] Vice Chairman Sun arrived in Guangzhou from Macau aboard the Yongxing warship on the morning of the 25th. He landed at Shamian at 4 PM. The entire city and county were decorated with flags and celebratory arches to welcome him, creating a warm atmosphere. A welcome meeting by all circles is scheduled to be held at 10 AM on the 26th at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. The city government had originally planned to rename the section from Huangsha to Dongdi as "Yat-sen Road," and a naming ceremony was scheduled for the 25th. However, due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed, as Vice Chairman Sun was the first mayor of Guangzhou. Furthermore, according to a report from Zhongshan: Vice Chairman Sun made remarks in Shiqi, stating: There are many misinterpretations regarding the Wei envoy's visit to China. He has never heard the Wei envoy criticize the Chinese government. He believes that after the Wei envoy returns to the United States, they will be able to help China. We should not harbor fear. Although the United States is currently a world power, a democratic country should respect public opinion. Therefore, the United States has no ambition to seize territory or resources, or to enslave the people of China, nor does it have such ambitions towards the world. We should seize the opportunity while the United States has a strong industrial power to welcome them to assist in our country's post-war reconstruction.</p>
<h3>Legend of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>Southward Travels: Random Notes, Part Two</p>
<p>This is one of the miracles in the history of Chinese railways.</p>
<p>From Guangzhou to Kowloon, the total length is 178.55 kilometers. However, the 35.78 kilometers from Kowloon to Shenzhen belong to the British section. In other words, the remaining 142.77 kilometers are the Chinese section, under our country's jurisdiction. Before the War of Resistance and until its victory, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was an independent unit. After the victory, the national railway system was divided into districts for management. For example, the Nanxun Railway was merged into the Zhegan District, the Huhang Railway was merged into the Jinghu District, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways were also merged into the Yuehan District.</p>
<p>I once asked Mr. Du Zhenyuan, the Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, and learned that the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway accounts for about 40% of the monthly passenger and freight revenue of the Yuehan District. The Yuehan Railway, from Wuchang to Guangzhou, is 1,080 kilometers long, nearly seven times the length of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The route distance ratio of seven to one, and the passenger and freight revenue ratio of six to four, the main reason, apart from traffic conditions, is the overseas outlet in Kowloon.</p>
<p>If everyone remembers, during the War of Resistance, before the fall of Guangzhou, we used the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for transportation in a state of constantly begging. Today, things have changed, and cooperation has restarted. However, the pain and troubles of those involved are beyond the imagination of outsiders.</p>
<p>Let me give you a recent example:</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on August 15th, a tragic train collision occurred at Buji Station, resulting in the immediate deaths of two stokers and two passengers. Three passengers were seriously injured and three were slightly injured. The cause of the accident was that a special train fully loaded with railway equipment from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, upon reaching a point 138.5 kilometers from Guangzhou, suddenly had its last three carriages' couplings break, causing them to roll backwards towards Buji Station and violently collide with freight train No. 96 from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, which was stopped at the station. This caused the locomotive and carriages two, three, four, and five of train No. 96 to derail simultaneously.</p>
<p>After the incident, the Yuehan Railway Bureau issued a statement claiming that the train originated from the British section, and the drivers and stokers were all dispatched by the British section, so they believed that the British section should be responsible for the accident. The British section stated that the accident location was in the Chinese section, and the train was allocated by the Transportation Administration. The couplings had different structures, leading to the uncoupling incident, so the British section could not be responsible. The two sides are passing blame onto each other. Who is ultimately responsible? A conclusion has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>From this recent example, it is not difficult to see the strange evolution of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, where unification has not been achieved and each section governs itself. Who can say that future tragedies will not occur again?</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1938, I traveled from Hong Kong to Hankou via the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways. Nine years have passed, and there have been no special changes along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. However, the scenery on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train is very different from what it was nine years ago.</p>
<p>The scenery on the train is exactly the same as what I saw on the Jinghu Line just after the victory in September 1945. A large number of small-scale traders and smugglers packed every carriage. Each time the train arrived in Guangzhou or Kowloon, these "light cavalry" rushed to the exit in a blitz-like manner. The situation seemed even more tense than escaping during an air raid alarm.</p>
<p>Smuggling on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has the spirit of Liangshan Marsh. Many retired soldiers rely on this route to support their families. They often carry dozens of cartons of cigarettes or a few pieces of clothing, which they bring from Kowloon and sell in Guangzhou, earning tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan each trip. They are very generous and straightforward. When they encounter customs officers, they will frankly say:</p>
<p>"Friend, I fought for eight years and have nothing left, only this treasure," saying this they would take down the pistol from his waist and wave it at the customs officers. Again using the pistol, they would point to the package in front of them saying:</p>
<p>"There is no other way, I rely on this to make a living."</p>
<p>Naturally, most of these heroes board the train midway and get off at the station before reaching their destination, taking small paths and shortcuts to evade customs and taxes. However, those who rely on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for smuggling to support their families are small-time smugglers between Hong Kong and Guangdong. They are merely fighting alone to make a living. Compared to large-scale organized smuggling by waterway, they are insignificant.</p>
<p>Because of the exposure of the secret compartments on the Foshan steamship, people have spread rumors that there are also places for hiding smuggled goods in the Guangzhou-Kowloon locomotives (i.e., train engines). Ordinary people often say that they are unfamiliar with the structure and parts of the locomotive, and the coal bunker, water tank, and engine are not easily noticed. The connections and gaps are even more incomprehensible to outsiders. Therefore, they become the safest places to hide goods. Where there is profit, especially in such an environment, it is difficult for us to believe that this rumor has no truth to it. Naturally, so far, there have been no accidents involving the locomotive. Let's hope this rumor is just a rumor.</p>
<p>The floods in the Dongguan area are frightening. Looking out the train window, it feels like sailing in a river. In many places, the water is level with the railway bed. At each small station, the sounds of men, women, and children selling longan, eggs, large candied fruits, and preserved meat rice are deafening. The noise is not only greater than that on the Jinghu Line, but also incomparable to the Yuehan Line. It tells me that this is the scenery of a disaster area, this is the urgent struggle for survival.</p>
<p>My traveling companion, Mr. S, pointed to a wisp of smoke rising in the distance outside the window and said to me:</p>
<p>"I am most afraid of seeing the smoke rising from the countryside in the evening. It reminds me of home."</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Your hometown is probably not much different from here now."</p>
<p>The Way Of Blood Or Gold. A foreign female colleague once used this phrase to refer to the Burma Road. Sitting in a Guangzhou-Kowloon train carriage, I suddenly thought of her name.</p>

<h3>Tsaldaris Makes Renewed Efforts, New Greek Cabinet May Be Formed Today, US Hopes Liberal Party Will Join Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 25th (Xinhua News Agency dispatch): After renewed consultations with leaders of various parties, Tsaldaris hopes to submit the list of proposed cabinet members to the King at 7 PM today. It is also learned that Tsaldaris had a meeting with US Ambassador MacVeagh to explore the US's opinions on the formation of a cabinet.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Tsaldaris issued a statement saying that he hopes to form a new Greek cabinet as soon as possible, adopting the broadest possible coalition system to replace the overthrown cabinet. The US Embassy signaled to Liberal Party leader Sophoulis, hoping that the Liberal Party would participate in the new government and suggested that Sophoulis propose a counter-proposal to the "joint command" proposal put forward by the People's Party. Sophoulis's reply to Tsaldaris was not made public, but according to an official, Sophoulis said that if the People's Party's policies fail, the Liberal Party will govern alone.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 25th] The People's Party leader Tsaldaris, who was ordered to form a cabinet, began visiting leaders of various parties today and visited former Prime Minister Sophoulis, the leader of the Liberal Party. US diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to the development of the Greek political situation. US Ambassador MacVeagh entered the palace last night to meet King Paul. Afterwards, MacVeagh said, "We hope to have a Greek government with a more free foundation. The United Kingdom and the United States are here to guide and offer opinions and are not interested in political parties and individuals."</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 24th] Police, military police, and the army in Athens have taken precautions to prevent any possible riots. Regarding the formation of a cabinet, some observers believe that based on the emergency statement made by Defense Minister Veni-zelos on the 23rd, "If General Zervas clings to his post, the United States will inevitably stop supplying the Greek government with weapons and equipment to suppress the guerrillas." It is highly likely that General Zervas will not participate in the new cabinet. Some qualified observers believe that if Zervas withdraws from the cabinet, relations between the Greek government and the guerrillas may improve.</p>
<h3>US Emergency Military Supplies Shipped to Greece by Sea in a Steady Stream, US Officials Issue Broadcast Reviewing Aid to Greece Plan</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] The US State Department recently announced that in order to step up aid to Greece, the United States has shipped 50,000 long tons of emergency military supplies to Greece by sea. At the same time, the US Navy will transfer six 176-foot-long patrol boats to the Greek government. Greek sailors for these patrol boats will arrive in the United States this month to receive rigorous training. In addition, the US will transfer a large number of minesweeper parts to the Greek Navy. Since Greece has suffered severe railway damage, it relies entirely on marine navigation for transportation, so minesweeping is extremely important.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 24th] Henderson, Director of the Near East and Africa Division of the State Department, said in a broadcast yesterday that the "Free Greece" radio station, which has been secretly operating in southern Albania, has declared the establishment of a new "Democratic Government of Greece." He said that this action could be used as an excuse by other countries to recognize this so-called "Free Greece" and further assist the guerrillas. He said, "Assuming that the situation develops to a serious state before the UN General Assembly convenes, it will be necessary to take drastic actions to aid Greece."</p>
<h3>Greece and Bulgaria Accuse Each Other</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 24th] The Athens News Agency reported that after the Bulgarian government complained to the Allied Control Council about Greece deploying troops on the border and provoking border incidents, the Greek government issued a statement today refuting it.

<h3>After Publication of Molotov's Reply Letter, Soviet Attitude Becomes More Extreme, Shtykov Again Criticizes US Side</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 25th] Soviet Representative Shtykov of the US-Soviet Joint Commission received reporters at Deoksu Palace today and issued Foreign Minister Molotov's reply to Secretary of State Marshall, stating that the Soviet side believes that parties or groups with only 20 or 30 members cannot represent public opinion. Therefore, the Soviet side still insists that only those with more than 10,000 members are qualified to be consulted.</p>
<p>He also said that the current arrest of democratic elements in South Korea by the US military authorities is hindering the development of democratization in Korea, and the Soviet representative cannot help but express his opinion.</p>
<p>Hodge Refutes Soviet Accusation</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 25th] US military commander in South Korea, Hodge, issued an important communique today, stating that he was quite surprised by the Soviet representative's expression of condemnation on the 22nd regarding the South Korean authorities' arrest of reactionary elements. He has made the greatest effort to maintain political, economic, and security aspects in South Korea. This investigation is to suppress lawbreakers who oppose the government and disrupt order. He has obtained sufficient evidence that they are accepting commands from North Korea. He regrets the Soviet representative's condemnation of South Korean administration.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Widely Planting Pawns in South Korea</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 25th] Major General Brown, chief representative of the US side of the US-Soviet Joint Commission, declared today that he has advised the Soviet Union to avoid getting involved in the Korean political vortex.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies Plot Self-Defense, Chiang Chia-tung Flies to Yogyakarta Today</h3>

<h3>Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe Not Limited to Western Europe, Also Related to the Far East and Other Regions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Government economists on the 24th observed that once the Marshall Plan is implemented, it will involve more countries in addition to Western European countries. They believe that countries in the Far East, South America, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand will directly or indirectly participate in the work of the Marshall Plan. Due to this, these economists do not overemphasize the general pessimistic view of Western Europe's future food supply. They acknowledge that the current food outlook is not bright, but they are not worried about the general impression that Western Europe will not be able to feed itself within a few years. Their reasons are:</p>
<p>Western Europe's Difficulties Are Not Serious</p>
<p>(1) Western Europe's power to develop agricultural production is greater than generally believed. (2) The "Iron Curtain" between Eastern and Western Europe cannot prevent Western European industrialized countries from producing products that Eastern European agricultural countries urgently need. Therefore, the exchange of food products can be developed, which can greatly reduce the scarcity of countries lacking agricultural products. They believe that the mismatch between Western Europe's products and needs is not as great as expected. If Western Europe can easily obtain what it needs from all over the world with its products, coupled with US aid, all problems will be solved.</p>
<h3>US Wants to Make Pan-American Mutual Defense Treaty Communist-Proof, Pan-American Conference Progressing Smoothly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Petropolis, Brazil, 24th] The United States has been making behind-the-scenes efforts at the Pan-American Conference on the night of the 24th to make the defense treaty of the Western Hemisphere a treaty with a communist-proof smokescreen. This effort is currently underway in the six-nation subcommittee.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Petropolis, Brazil, 74th] Well-informed sources said that an agreement has been reached on two-thirds of the defense treaty for the Pan-American Mutual Defense Conference. At the same time, Argentina's request for non-use of force to resolve disputes in the Western Hemisphere was also agreed upon by a compromise proposal submitted by Venezuela, which stipulates: (1) Joint consultations shall be conducted before taking military action against internal aggression in the Western Hemisphere. (2) Joint military defense measures shall be taken immediately when dealing with aggression from outside the Western Hemisphere, and then consultations shall be conducted. In addition, an agreement has not yet been reached on Argentina's request for consensus before joint action.</p>
<h3>Three Released US Soldiers Return to Camp, Claim to Have Mistakenly Entered Soviet-Occupied Zone</h3>

<h3>Implementing Restrictions on Converting Pounds into Dollars, British Cabinet Discusses Economic Decisions, Eady to Report on Anglo-American Financial Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: The British Cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 25th to discuss the issue of a possible 50% to 75% reduction in US food imports, as well as the accompanying issue of reducing domestic food rations.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet today, presided over by Prime Minister Attlee, to discuss the impact of restrictions on converting pounds into dollars. In addition, the coal production problem may also be discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] When the British Cabinet meets today, there will be three major issues to be decided: (1) The new food rations that the British people should receive after reducing food imports from the dollar zone; (2) Revising the import plans for non-dollar countries in the Eastern Hemisphere, which now all need pounds since the United Kingdom has regained control of the pound; (3) Estimating the amount of supplies that the Commonwealth countries can provide to the United Kingdom from the United States. Although the decision on these three major issues requires the same period of research, a temporary decision on the amount of food rations for the British people can be made within a week. The Cabinet will also listen to Eady's report on attending the Washington financial conference. Eady is expected to arrive in London at 12:30 today. It is said that Eady will soon return to Washington. The main unresolved issue of the Washington Anglo-American financial talks is that the United States insists that Article 9 of the Anglo-American loan agreement, which prohibits discrimination, must remain in effect until it is deleted by Congress with a special bill. However, a compromise agreement has now been reached in which the United States "informally" recognizes that the United Kingdom cannot comply with that clause. According to British financial experts, this compromise agreement merely recognizes the inevitable facts in the current situation. The United Kingdom is now turning to its Commonwealth countries and European countries to seek closer economic cooperation.</p>
<h3>French People's Union Announced Its Establishment Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] General de Gaulle formally established his French People's Union on the 25th, and at the same time announced that he would submit a list of candidates to participate in the municipal elections in October. He insisted that the Union's target is French communism, but it is by no means a political party. The Union transcends party boundaries, and candidates can have different political views, but they participate in the Union under the premise of seeking public welfare.</p>

<h3>Britain Emphasizes Far East Interests: McNeil and Others Discuss the Japanese Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Reuter, 25th dispatch] Edison (British Minister of State for Relations with the United Nations), the chief representative of the United Kingdom at the Canberra conference on the Japanese peace treaty, and Minister of State McNeil told reporters today that they would protect British interests in the Pacific. Edison said that Britain wants to protect its interests in the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places, and wants to develop the resources in these areas. When a reporter specifically asked about the status of Hong Kong, Edison replied: This matter depends on the final decision, but he emphasized that Britain has no intention of abandoning its vested interests in any place. Someone asked whether the Japanese peace treaty would be drafted only by the four powers or by all relevant countries. McNeil replied: Drafting the peace treaty is the work of the major powers that actually directly participated in the war, but another agency will be established for other relevant countries to participate. Mr. McNeil said that Britain will support Australia's opposition to the use of the veto power at the Pacific peace conference. Regarding the issue of Japan's post-war territory, Mr. McNeil replied that this matter has been agreed upon at repeated international conferences, and Japan's territory is limited to the four main islands and some small islands. When a reporter asked whether Britain supports the US proposal at the Pacific peace conference that a two-thirds majority can pass, Mr. Edison said he did not want to discuss this issue at this stage. It is expected that this issue will be raised for discussion at the Canberra conference. Regarding the issue of Japanese compensation, Mr. Edison said that Britain will do its best to support reasonable compensation requirements, but does not want to see impoverished Japanese people rely on others for survival. Mr. McNeil said that the agency that supervises the implementation of the Japanese peace treaty "should be retained when necessary." He emphasized that security should be the primary consideration.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation Begins on Direct Tax Bureau Corruption Case: Chairman of the Wood Industry Association, Zhang Zhongyuan, Reports on the Process; Tax Officials Return Bribe Money to Six Businesses; Bureau Chief Lou States that Six Businesses Had Signed Statements Denying the Matter</h3>
<p>Yao Zengji, the inspection director of the Ministry of Finance sent by the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the case of corruption by auditors of the Direct Tax Bureau of this city, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at about 10 o'clock, he and Inspector Wan Gengxin went to the chairman of the Wood Industry Association, Zhang Zhongyuan, to investigate the target. They inquired in detail about the details of the corruption case of the direct tax auditors in this city.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 7 p.m., Municipal Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General Yan Yisheng, Direct Tax Bureau Chief Lou Guocheng, Senator Zhang Zhongyuan, Lawyer Chu Shun, and supervisors from the Direct Tax Bureau, a total of five people, discussed the direct tax audit corruption case in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce conference room. It is reported that Mr. Zhang immediately reported the circumstances of the negotiation of conditions at the Jinghua Restaurant on the 18th of this month, the contents of the discussion during the lunch at two other industry colleagues, the Jiali Hotel, the next day, and the amount of money requested and the process. It is said that only his company had already paid 10,000,000 yuan, which was finally reduced to 2,900,000 yuan after consultation. The amount of money for the remaining six companies was also huge, and checks were issued by each of these companies. Later, after the case was exposed in Beijing, all the bribed personnel, upon hearing the news, immediately returned the money taken in the original amount with another check.

<h3>Mobile Hospital Drives into the Countryside to Provide Services: The Culmination of the Efforts of Gongji Hospital, with Perfect Equipment; The Farmers Seeking Treatment Crowded in Yuqing, Dachang</h3>
<p>A five-ton Dodge truck, after nearly a year of continuous assembly and transformation, consuming the designer's endless efforts, has been completed as a mobile hospital dedicated to serving the countryside. On a hot morning—August 17th—it secretly slipped out of the gate of Gongji Hospital, leaving the bustling city and heading straight to the countryside. The two directors who initiated and designed and built this mobile hospital—Dr. Zhu Yanggao and Dr. Ding Mingquan—led more than 20 staff members, including the attending physicians of internal medicine, surgery, and obstetrics, X-ray physicians, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, administrative directors, registrars, and workers, who all sat quietly in the car.</p>
<p>The mobile hospital issued an emergency whistle, opened full speed, and rushed out of the noisy and dull city center. The staff in the car also hoped to arrive at their destination early—Yuqing Bridge, Dachang.</p>
<p>Complete Equipment for Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics, and Laboratory Testing</p>
<p>The scenery along the way was ordinary and not worth browsing. The reporter's mind could not help but turn to this mobile hospital. The reporter had seen many ambulances before, which were pitiful, and most of them were simply equipped. Looking at this mobile hospital, it has everything that it should have, and it deserves to be called a "hospital." It can be said to be unique in the country. It is equipped with a generator, X-ray fluoroscopy and photography equipment. The laboratory department includes microscopes and common clinical laboratory supplies and equipment. In terms of internal medicine, there is a medicine box full of various commonly used medicines and dispensing tools; in terms of surgery and obstetrics, there is a complete set of equipment that can perform major operations. In addition, the equipment includes two soft beds that can bring patients back, a large water tank with a capacity of 80 gallons, a large tent that can hold two operating tables, as well as dozens of wooden sticks attached to the tent, and a number of tennis nets surrounding the tent to prevent outsiders from approaching the tent. Each department of internal medicine has a consultation box, prepared to walk to visit seriously ill patients in places where cars cannot reach. In addition, there are dozens of pounds of alcohol, dozens of pounds of distilled water. After calculating, these equipments are enough to fill a car, but the designers cleverly used the gaps under the car walls, car bottom, and seats, so the car can still seat more than ten people.</p>
<p>Quickly Set Up Tents Amidst Broken Walls</p>
<p>At this moment, the car stopped. The car stopped at the entrance of the former site of the China Children's Health Institute. All the people rushed down and immediately started to arrange after slightly surveying the address in the broken walls. The teachers and students of Yucai School were very enthusiastic and willing to help them, but they politely declined because they wanted to use their own manpower and equipment to calculate the time required to set up the complete set of equipment. Without distinguishing, they worked quickly and actually set up the tent in half an hour. The tennis net was surrounded on the outside, and the registration office began to register. The generator was already running, the lights in the tent were on, the water on the electric stove was boiling, and the typhoid and cholera vaccinations began. More and more people were registering, but they still maintained a fairly good order. The internist picked up the stethoscope, the pharmacist was dispensing medicine, the surgeon was examining the wound, the patients who needed to be tested were already waiting for the report at the laboratory, the X-ray machine was emitting light, and the X-ray physician was hiding in the airless car, sweating profusely. The two directors patrolled everywhere, and at any time wrote down the items that needed to be added or reformed. The reporter came for sightseeing, but was attracted by their tense and excited working conditions, and could not help but also participate in their work and do some obligations.</p>
<p>A patient in the mobile hospital registers, sees a doctor, takes medicine, and adds various examinations, and at most, they don't have to wait for a lens, which is incomparable to going to a big hospital in the city, where you have to wait for half a day.</p>
<p>Strong Women in the Field Undergoing Surgery on the Spot</p>
<p>I was idly watching in the internal medicine outpatient department when I suddenly heard Director Zhu, who was standing in the operating room, shouting:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu, would you like to come and see?"</p>
<p>A woman in her thirties was preparing to lie on the operating table. Two surgeons pointed out to me that this rural woman was burned on her neck when she was five years old, leaving a big scar on her neck after healing, so that her head was always tilted to the left and could not turn to the right. For decades, she has lived this kind of life. Now, she wants to use plastic surgery to correct it, and after a while, she will be able to turn her head to the right.</p>
<p>The operation began. There was a fluorescent light on the top of the tent. The operating table was in the center, and the operating table and operating lamp were next to it. Behind the surgeons, there was an electric fan each. The nurses and workers were constantly spraying DDT around the outside of the tent to prevent mosquitoes and flies from flying into the tent. The operation was completed soon, and the patient stood up, shook her head to the right, and thanked the two doctors. A worker serving in the mobile hospital, watching her back, said to himself: "The rich people in Shanghai don't have the good fortune of having surgery delivered to their door!"</p>
<p>After a camp-style lunch, work began again. At 4 p.m., this group of staff members packed everything up and planned to go back. The surrounding farmers and students asked: "When will you come again?"</p>
<h3>Suddenly Carrying a Patient with Appendicitis</h3>
<p>The car drove to the Dachang Town People's Education Center and stopped to work for another two hours. Just as the car was about to drive back two hours later, a villager ran from several miles away, saying that there was a patient at home who seemed to have appendicitis and wanted to ask the doctor from the mobile hospital to take a look. Upon hearing the news, the surgeon ran off. An hour later, a female patient with suppurated appendicitis was sent to the bed on the mobile hospital's stretcher. Five minutes before the car was about to start, there were still a few villagers who rushed several miles to see a doctor, but unfortunately it was too late, everything had been put away, and the car had already started, so they could only comfort them to come again next time.</p>
<p>On the way back to Gongji Hospital, the reporter asked Mr. Chen, who was in charge of registration, how many outpatients there were today. She took out a list from the box and showed it to me. It was written on it: 91 internal medicine outpatients, 85 surgical outpatients, 5 gynecology outpatients, and 88 typhoid and cholera vaccinations.</p>
<p>More than 20 staff members were busy all day, but their spirits were still full. Director Zhu was smoking a cigarette and leaning on the back of his chair, contemplating.</p>
<p>Digging Holes in the Wooden Gate: Patients Pay What They Can Afford</p>
<p>"Director Zhu, although your hospital's work is a practice, your staff's spirit is too good, and the work is too meaningful!" the reporter said to him.</p>
<p>"I don't dare to say that. After this performance, I found that there are still many places that need to be improved. What I want to develop is the rural anti-tuberculosis campaign and the trachoma prevention and treatment campaign. A projector to promote common sense of hygiene and epidemic prevention is in the plan. I originally planned to install a short-wave walkie-talkie in the car so that I could contact the hospital anytime and anywhere, but the Ministry of Communications did not allow this, so I am afraid there is no hope, which is very regrettable. I plan to build a few more cars in the future, and it will not be as difficult as this time, because this time it was changed again and again! I will go to Dachang again next Saturday. I may have to go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month. I hope everyone will come to study improvement methods, and I hope everyone will promote it so that more mobile hospitals can go to the countryside."</p>
<p>"I am very willing to be a volunteer promoter of mobile hospitals. I have one more question, how come I didn't see you charge patients?"</p>
<p>"Haha! We want to give the best things to the countryside. We don't plan to charge farmers too much. Our method of charging is also a bit special," he said, pointing his finger at a wooden box with a hole dug in it. Patients put some money in it at will, and it is okay if they don't pay. We are imitating Shanghai's Zhang Zhengqi's method, which is the most appropriate method for the poor. We adopted it today."</p>
<p>"Today, we probably didn't receive tens of thousands of dollars in total," the registrar reported, shaking the wooden box with her hand. (Special Correspondent)</p>

The gas station attendant will fill in the amount of gasoline sold and the date on the gasoline purchase permit and stamp it as proof. (3) If an automobile runs out of gasoline on the road and cannot reach a gas station, the nearby gas station may sell emergency gasoline with the car's gasoline purchase permit, limited to one gallon. The car owner must provide their own can, and the procedure in point 2 should be followed for recording.

The gas station attendant will record this information themselves and report it directly to the oil company.</p>
<h3>Four Young Women Fall into a Trap Seeking a Livelihood, Unable to Return Home, Forced into Prostitution, Headhunter Shop Owner's Wife Traffics Humans</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Changshu Road Police Precinct recently uncovered a case of human trafficking and forcing women into prostitution. It began with four women from Guixian, Xiang Juan (20 years old), Mai Cuizhen (26 years old), Wang Yuqin (21 years old), and Zhu Cuiqin (16 years old), who, due to poverty, went from their village to the county town to work as maids. They met Cui Zhi, the owner's wife of a headhunter shop in the town. Recently, Cui Zhi falsely claimed that a wool factory in Shanghai was recruiting female workers with a monthly salary of hundreds of thousands. The four women quit their jobs in the countryside and came to Shanghai with Cui Zhi on the 18th of this month. They were directly sent to Yang Biao's place at 26 North Zhaojia Zhai, Xietu Road, with the understanding that Yang would take care of everything and introduce them to work, and Cui Zhi would return to her hometown first.</p>
<p>A few days later, Yang claimed that he could not find work and asked them to return home and wait for news. The four women, finding it difficult to travel and lacking funds to return, asked Yang to find a solution. Unexpectedly, Yang said that they could stay in Shanghai, but they would have to make a living by prostituting themselves. Forced by circumstances, the four women, starting from the 20th, were taken to small inns in the South Tibet Road area by Yang's wife, Li Cuizhen, and his sister, Yang Fenghua, to solicit business every day at 5 PM. On that day, in one night until 12 PM, the four of them had received as many as eleven customers, suffering greatly, and all the money they earned was taken away by Yang. Qiu Xiangjuan, being more alert, took the opportunity to escape and reported to the Changshu Police Station. The police were dispatched to arrest Yang and his wife and sister, as well as the other three women, and brought them to the police station. Yang admitted to trafficking women and forcing them into prostitution, saying that he had asked Qiu Cuizhi to find four women because he could not make a living, paying a price of 200,000 yuan per person, totaling 800,000 yuan. Based on the confession, the police station transferred Yang and others to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. The four women, Qiu and the others, were temporarily placed under the care of the First Security Section of the precinct. Cheng Fang and Zhang Jinsheng, for professional negligence causing death, were sentenced to one year and four months imprisonment and eight months imprisonment respectively. The civil suit part was transferred to the Civil Court for handling. The reasons for Cheng Fang's verdict: (1) The Zhijiang ship's navigation line error caused the collision. (2) The ship was supposed to carry 357 passengers, but it carried over a thousand passengers at the time of the accident. The reasons for Zhang Jinsheng's verdict: (1) According to maritime law, barges should be placed behind the ship, but the Huatong ship placed the barges on both sides, hindering navigation. (2) Before the collision of the two ships, the Zhijiang ship sounded its whistle twice, but the Huatong ship ignored it, so the Huatong ship should also be held responsible for the collision.</p>

<h3>Ninth National Party Congress of the Kuomintang, Satisfactorily Concluded Yesterday Afternoon, Second Meeting Held in the Morning, Mayor Reports on Governance, Resolved and Passed 64 Important Cases</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Ninth National Congress of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality continued to meet in the City Council yesterday morning and afternoon, and concluded satisfactorily at 7 PM in the afternoon. The opening ceremony was chaired by Chairman Fang, who delivered the closing remarks, and then passed a declaration and shouted slogans, closing the meeting amidst the melodious sound of military music.</p>
<p>Deeply Ashamed of the Serious Housing Shortage</p>
<p>At the second conference held at 9 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu delivered a report on governance, stating briefly: The problems of Shanghai's governance can be divided into four parts: (1) Ordinary administrative problems, the main ones of which can be divided into three categories: (A) Street washing. The streets have not been repaired for eight years during the war of resistance, and it is really difficult to repair them now based on the current municipal revenue situation, but the municipal government is still working hard to carry it out. (B) Traffic congestion is common in major cities such as New York and Chicago. Shanghai's roads are old, and the road surface is uneven, while there are many vehicles, which is the main reason for congestion. (C) The housing shortage is partly due to the concentration of population in the city, but the main reason is that no one is building houses. The municipal government originally allocated funds to build houses, but it could not become a reality due to the rapid changes in prices, which made it impossible to solve the city's housing shortage for a long time, and I am deeply ashamed.</p>
<p>Prices Affect Social Problems</p>
<p>(2) Problems arising from the merger of the concessions. A concession cleanup committee has been organized, and currently the former Public Concession has been completely cleared, and the former French Concession is under negotiation. (3) Economic problems are national problems, so they must be resolved in coordination with the central government's policies. Due to the limitations of his authority, the municipal government can only crack down on black markets and speculation in a passive way. In addition, various social problems arise from economic problems, such as (A) price increases leading to appropriations, street vendors obstructing traffic, and poor households leading to fire hazards and epidemics. The municipal government takes into account the lives of the poor. (B) The municipal government itself is unable to budget this year due to price fluctuations. (C) Wages are rising with prices, and many factories are closing down because they cannot afford it. The municipal government is actively promoting labor-management coordination, and wages are being increased to a limited extent. (4) Party issues. The Kuomintang is for the country and the people, and is seeking the safety and prosperity of all citizens. As for those who attempt to sabotage and launch strikes, the government will punish them according to the law.</p>
<p>Uphold Justice, Unite Sincerely</p>
<p>Wu concluded by declaring: Shanghai's governance faces many difficulties that are not found elsewhere. It is difficult to overcome the many difficulties, but the problems still exist. I hope that all comrades in the city will unite sincerely to overcome the difficulties and contribute a few points to the delegates: (1) Uphold justice, (2) Report corruption, (3) Advocate thrift, (4) Unite sincerely. Then the discussion began, and at noon Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for all the delegates at the Central Bank Club. The discussion continued at 3 PM, and the meeting resolved to pass 64 cases, including "Ordinary establishment of grassroots organizations to strengthen party-state activities," "Submit to the Central Government to enrich the economic strength of grassroots party headquarters to increase work efficiency," and the temporary motion "Please ask the conference to immediately telegraph the Central Government to confiscate or use without interest all foreign exchange in the United States held by ordinary wealthy families to replenish the national revival of savings deposits to solve the domestic economic crisis." After review, the conference made resolutions on both Chairman Fang's party affairs report and Mayor Wu's governance report.</p>
<p>List of Elected Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The third conference was held at 4 PM to elect the entire Executive Supervisory Committee. After the election was completed, Hong, a committee member, supervised the counting of the ballots. The results of the elected members of the Executive Committee were Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Xie Ren, Chen Baotai, Wang Jiashu, Wang Xianqing, Xu Mingya, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhang Mingsong, Xie Dahuang, Fan Heyan, Wang Xinheng, Sun Jialiang, Wang, Chai Zifei, Chen Boliang, Wang Guoping. Supervisory Committee: Shen Ding, Chen Baohua, Yuan Zhe, Cao Peilong, Ge Kexin, Tong Tang Tianen, Qian Jianqiu, Hou Gaoren.</p>

<h3>Strong Fortress on the Western Hebei Front, Baoding Relieved</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 21st] Baoding has been relieved. The ancient city of western Hebei, which has endured fright and pain, has survived a storm. This reporter entered Baoding with the army for the first inspection. Since this spring, Baoding has been facing the enemy on three sides. Only the Ping-Bao Road is the only artery. When it is cut off, Baoding becomes an isolated island behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>The clouds of war have passed, but the scenes of war remain. Deep trenches and high ramparts surround the city, with barbed wire as dense as a spider web. The city gates are closed every night at 10 o'clock and martial law is enforced. Every day, tens of thousands of civilians dig and repair the moat. From 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM, lines of civilians appear on the streets, in groups of three to five, carrying shovels and dry rations, smiling and staggering toward the construction site. One shovel after another, the outer moat is deepened, the bunkers are completed, and the people's blood and sweat build a Great Wall of life.</p>
<p>Baoding is the often overlooked capital of Hebei Province. It stands alongside Beiping and Tianjin. The center of culture and politics is in Beiping, but commercial trade is taken over by Tianjin. It is not even as good as the new city of Shijiazhuang—before the construction of the Ping-Han Railway, Shijiazhuang was just a remote village. It seems to be</p>
<p>A soulless shell, without vitality, without vigor.</p>
<p>Baoding is actually the "provisional capital" of Hebei. The military and political bigwigs here often travel between Ping and Bao, but their mansions are probably all in Beiping. The command post in Beiping is the nerve center for issuing orders, even more active and spirited than the Pacification Headquarters.</p>
<p>It is said that Hebei's politics are "difficult to handle because there are too many mothers-in-law. There are many people who talk, but few people who take responsibility and do things." The party, government, military, and groups have not yet formed a unified force. Especially on the eve of the general election, everyone is keen on arranging elections. How to cooperate with the military to carry out the work of recovering areas is regarded as a secondary issue.</p>
<p>The city has several classical main streets, neat and full of ancient charm. Fortunately, there are not many cars because the roads are narrow. Baoding is not a center for the distribution of goods, so there are no large merchants. The trading places are quite desolate, especially during the siege. People from the countryside cannot enter, trains do not run, goods are not smooth, and the decline in purchasing power makes business sluggish.</p>
<p>Due to the existence of hostile forces, the city and countryside are under strict blockade. Since open trade is not possible, there is inevitably a sneaky</p>
<p>"Smuggling" phenomenon. The communists exchange cotton for goods from the city. A large batch of medicines was transported away a few days ago, and it is said that they could even buy bullets before. "Those who live near the mountain burn firewood, those who live near the water eat fish." Guarding the passes and taking on inspection duties has become a "lucrative position."</p>
<p>The branches of culture are gradually withering, and Baoding is suffering from cultural anemia due to malnutrition. The only local publication is a four-page "Baoding Daily," but its layout and content are like an evening newspaper. In addition to a few more local news items, its sales are taken away by the Pingjin newspapers that arrive on the same day. Bookstores only have one or two new magazines on the shelves, and the bookshelves are full of old novels and books and periodicals full of low taste. The war makes people irritable. Buried in old novels, the psychology of spending time is a movie theater and a theater, which are now used by the political work team of the Security Command to perform dramas, and the Siwei Drama School performs new Ping opera, which is considered the only artistic activity here.</p>
<p>The market on West Street is the commercial center. Although it does not have the density and prosperity of the Dong'an Market in Beiping, it is still quite large. Several large courtyards are connected to each other, and people come and go like shuttles.</p>
<p>People who have been to Baoding will buy a few baskets of "Baofu side dishes and sweet bean sauce" as gifts. These are Baoding's famous specialties. "Huaimao Company" on West Street is the authority on pickles and sauces. There are two locust trees that can be hugged by talents at the door as its markers. Its history of more than 100 years elevates its status above other peers. The best dishes are soy-sauce almonds, peanuts, and soy-sauce bamboo shoots, costing 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per catty. Ordinary mixed pickles are bought for 3,500 yuan per small basket. After all, the goods are of high quality and taste, unlike ordinary things.</p>
<p>The Ping-Bao Road is damaged, and coal from Mentougou cannot be transported, and the countryside is sealed off, so food cannot enter the city. Fuel and food have become treasures of Baoding. Crushed coal and firewood cost 700 yuan per catty, and white flour sells for more than 4,000 yuan. The people here are living a difficult life under the high pressure of prices.</p>
<p>"Lotus Pond" is the only scenic spot in the city. Artificial hills like stones, pavilions, and terraces decorate a large courtyard into a park. The lotus pond is dozens of feet around, bounded by stone railings, but the pond water has long since dried up. The so-called "Lotus Pond" has long become a historical name. The predecessors planted trees and raised lotus flowers, but people have no intention of cultivating even a fresh flower. The war strangled the fun in the garden, and people have lost the mood to appreciate flowers and play scenery.</p>
<p>The famous Cao Yinhua Garden outside the south city wall is now the site of the Sicheng Middle School. Students armed with guns guard the two gates of the campus. During the war of defense, the students were also fully armed. During the summer vacation,</p>
<p>Students from the communist-held areas cannot return home, and school fees are not available. Everything needs to be self-sufficient. At a cost of 15,000 yuan per day, they act as hired workers and work for other people as civilians. Half work and half study, they are already self-reliant.</p>
<p>When this reporter left Baoding, the Ping-Bao Road had not yet been connected. To get from Baoding to Dingxing, you have to rely on a car. It is said that the communists have robbed the road twice south of Xushui, killing drivers, robbing passengers, and hijacking military and political personnel in the same car. The situation has become tense again recently. As long as the communists in Hebei are not eliminated, the clouds of war will close in on the periphery of Baoding at any time. Building fortifications is necessary, but safety cannot be guaranteed by defense alone. Moats cannot stop the enemy. What is needed now is more effective coordination between the military and the government to advance our political power to every corner. (Special Correspondent Jie Zhong)</p>

<h3>Potent Narcotics, Intercepted on a Ship from Tianjin to Shanghai, 60 Catties of White Powder Worth Over 1 Billion</h3>
<p>[Tianjin, 22nd] Amidst strict drug prohibition, the Tianjin Police Bureau recently uncovered another major case of trafficking in potent narcotics, seizing more than 90 taels (about 6 catties) of pure white powder, worth over 1 billion. Three drug traffickers were arrested. This is the largest drug trafficking case in Tianjin in recent years. The details are as follows: The Municipal Police Bureau recently learned that three accomplices, Du Wanqi, Wu Yicheng, and Yang Jinshan, were specializing in purchasing white powder in Pingjin and transporting it to Shanghai for sale in order to seek rights. Because they were extremely cunning, they changed their residences several times a day, making arrest extremely difficult. Later, it was learned that they had transported the narcotics to the "Beiming" ship, which was berthed at the Hedong Wharf in District 1 and about to sail to Shanghai. The police then sent officers to search the ship. Just as the "Beiming" ship was about to set sail, they ordered it to stop, boarded the ship for inspection, arrested Du Wanqi and the other two, and seized the white powder from their luggage. The three criminals and the narcotics were taken to the branch bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Death Row Inmates Lu Guisheng and Two Others Demolish Roof Rafters and Escape from Prison</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Songjiang, 24th] Several gunshots suddenly rang out at the county's District Court Detention Center at 3:50 AM on the 24th.

Lu Guisheng, who was sentenced to death for the crime of escaping as a bandit and was still awaiting judgment, and Wan Jianguo, who was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for the crime of escaping as a bandit and was still petitioning for appeal, and Zhang Fuyuan, a suspect in an adultery and murder case transferred from Chuansha, were immediately pursued by the guards and police, but have not been caught. The damaged part of the cell is very small, and the escapees destroyed it while standing on the bunk. Because the escapee Lu Guisheng was originally a plasterer with excellent skills, and although the cell was newly built, it was low and not strong, the escapees were able to get what they wanted.</p>

<h3>The First and Sixth Election Offices of Anhui Province are Established According to Law</h3>

<h3>Xie Huzhou Passes Through Suzhou on His Way to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou 25th Dispatch] Xie Yingzhou, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, arrived in Suzhou from the capital on official business a few days ago and stayed at the Huayuan Hotel.

<h3>Two Tax Officials from Changshu Flee; Embezzlement and Abandonment of Duty are Not Isolated Incidents</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu 24th Dispatch] Zhou Chan, the section chief of the second section of the local tax bureau, came to Changshu to work with Director Zhang Farong. After several months, he suddenly abandoned his post and fled, leaving no trace. A request for his arrest has been submitted to the Provincial Department of Finance. After the incident occurred, people in the community were very concerned. Zhou had told Director Zhang on the ninth of this month that Zhang Hui, the director of the Inspection Office of the Ministry of Land Affairs, had been appointed as the director of the Qingdao Municipal Land Administration Bureau and invited him to serve as the section chief of the first section. He requested to resign. Director Zhang said that the tax affairs were heavy and it was not convenient to replace him with a novice immediately, so the resignation was temporarily not discussed. Unexpectedly, on the eighteenth, Zhang Hui sent a telegram from the capital, saying: "Please approve Zhou Chan's resignation and come to the capital to take over in Qingdao." Considering the official duties of the employee, it was difficult to comply with the order to approve his resignation. After the telegram was sent back, Zhou did not come to the office to work from the afternoon of the nineteenth. A servant was immediately sent to search for him. According to reports, the landlord of the employee's residence said that he had gone to Qingdao. Director Zhang did not believe it at first, but on the twenty-first, a tax officer, Qin Zhizhong, held a private letter left by Zhou Chan when he left, which confirmed that Zhou had indeed abandoned his post and fled. Because Zhou was in charge of the business tax and autonomous tax of the second section, and his duties were heavy, and he personally handled and kept the accounts, if he did not make a detailed handover, others could not take over. It is believed that personnel who leave their posts without authorization and delay important public affairs should be brought to justice and given appropriate sanctions. A special telegram was sent to the province for his arrest and brought to justice. It is reported that there are many rumors about this incident. Zhou was suspected of embezzling ten million yuan in the previous case of fraud involving bricks, tiles, lime, etc., and the case is currently under thorough investigation. He may have fled out of fear of exposure, or it is said that the telegram from Nanjing was fabricated to create a false impression. The truth is now being investigated and will soon be revealed. [Another Dispatch] Jin Fan, the tax officer of the Dongtang dispatched district of the tax bureau, embezzled a large amount of tax money and fled without a trace. The county government military law office summoned Yun Ruinian, Jin's guarantor, to court for investigation and set a deadline for the case to be handed over for investigation.</p>
<h3>Excavation and Destruction of Tianhu Dike; People from All Walks of Life in Hunan Express Their Opposition; Telegrams are Sent Requesting the Central Government to Withdraw its Order to Pacify Public Anger</h3>
<p>[Our Hengyang 25th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of excavating and destroying the Tianhu Dike in Dongting Lake, the Ministry of Water Resources has decided to implement it on September 1. People from all walks of life in Hunan Province were outraged upon hearing the news and held meetings to discuss countermeasures, making the following suggestions: (1) It is recommended that the central government establish a Dongting Lake Water Conservancy Committee, with the participation of water conservancy engineering experts and provincial gentry from Hunan and Hubei provinces, to discuss the matter in the long term. (2) Mobilize the people of Hunan Lake to rise up and defend themselves for their own livelihoods. (3) Send a telegram to the central government requesting the withdrawal of the order to avoid making a big mistake. (4) Mobilize the people of the whole province to defend themselves together. (5) Appeal to the provincial government to withdraw from the excavation and dike monitoring work. The final resolution was to strengthen the organization of the Dongting Lake Water Conservancy Construction Promotion Committee, and the committee telegraphed the Ministry of Water Resources to withdraw its order to pacify public anger. The Hunan Provincial Senate also replied to the Ministry of Water Resources, expressing its opinion: (1) Will the Dongting Lake be permanently protected from flooding after the two dikes of Dongheng and Gu'er are destroyed? (2) If more than 100,000 farmers in the dikes are forcibly deprived of their livelihoods due to the dike excavation, will the Ministry of Water Resources be fully responsible for any bloodshed?</p>

<h3>The Buying Momentum of Chinese Stocks Turns Strong, and Most Close at High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market psychology was prosperous. The statement of Special Envoy Wei made buyers more determined, and active participants such as No. 223 long added to their positions, and No. 224 turned from short to long, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Near noon, the show was profitable, and most stocks closed at high prices. The foundation is very stable, and the future seems to have a small well-off situation.</p>
<p>The opening price was high. The opening price of No. 61 of the present Yongsha Jing was as high as 230 yuan, and the price of the next Yongsha had to be inverted. After the opening, the price of the present Yongsha dropped slightly because Nos. 223 and 14 closed their positions at high prices, but the price of the next Yongsha rose to 231 yuan after being bought by Nos. 112, etc. Nos. 45 and others sold one after another, and the price once fell to 224 yuan.

Nos. 45 and 186 still supplied at high prices, and the price was slightly down. After 11:30, Nos. 224 and 94 absorbed non-stop, and No. 154 forcefully bought the present Yongsha. Before closing, the price rose to high prices of 233 yuan and 234 yuan, and then closed at prices of 232 yuan and 233 yuan.</p>
<p>After closing, No. 223 still bought and told Hui Sheng. As a result, the prices of the stocks to be delivered next Saturday, including Yongsha, Xinhuo, Meiya, and Yonggong, each rose by about half a percent, Xinhua rose by more than 10%, Xingguang Jingfu Zhongfa rose slightly, Qinxing was the only one that was flat, Zhongsheng rose by less than 10%, Xinya rose by half a percent, underwear Datong fell slightly, Lian was the only one that was flat, and the rest rose slightly.

The directors of the association have publicly elected Qiu Lianggui to take over temporarily, pending the re-election at the general meeting at the end of October.</p>
<h3>National Bonds and Foreign Stocks Prosper</h3>

<h3>The Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee Approves Loan Statistics</h3>

This is followed by those ranging from 400 million yuan to 500 million yuan, accounting for 24.3%. The third place is those under 100 million yuan, accounting for 15.5%.</p>
<h3>Li Lixia Discusses the Current Price Trend</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Li Lixia, director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, yesterday expressed his views on the current price trend and the issue of inspecting firms and banks in his personal capacity as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Price issue: Based on observations in recent years, the possibility of price fluctuations in a year is two-thirds in the first half of the year and one-half in the second half of the year. Every year after July, the price trend gradually tends to stabilize. This is because our country is an agricultural country. After July, it is the autumn harvest season, and agricultural materials are produced in large quantities, and urban currency flows to the countryside. Therefore, urban prices are often more stable in the second half of the year. However, after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price of yarn and cloth may fluctuate due to the fact that farmers add cloth in the morning. However, since the restoration, the number of yarn and cloth machines has generally increased, so it is expected that the price of yarn and cloth this year will not fluctuate sharply.</p>
<p>Spot Check on Firms and Banks</p>
<p>(2) Issue of inspecting firms and banks: The inspection of firms and banks in this city is directly managed by the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank is in a supporting position. After the Ministry of Finance recently revoked the licenses of several banks, most firms and banks in this city are now aware of the warning, and the practice of substituting licenses has decreased. The authorities' inspection method will first conduct spot checks on unstable firms and banks. Spot checks will be avoided as much as possible on firms and banks with stable operations in order to guide the financial industry onto the right track.</p>
<h3>The Surplus of the Former Textile Management Cotton Yarn Purchase Will Be Used as a Fund for Cotton Production Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The issue of the disposal of the surplus funds of more than 90 billion yuan from the purchase of cotton yarn by the former Textile Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been approved by the Executive Yuan. First, more than 40 billion yuan will be allocated to the Cotton Production Improvement Office as the office's fund, stipulating that the interest income of the fund will be used as part of the office's expenses. (2) The remaining more than 40 billion yuan will be used to form a Textile Business Fund Management Committee, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The committee will include three members each from state-owned and private yarn factories, and one member each from the Ministry of Finance, the All-China Economic Council, and the Textile Adjustment Committee, and two members from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In addition, it has been decided that the original using institutions should pay the full amount of the part of the surplus funds that has already been used.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Industrial Sector Meet with President Zhang to Request Lenient Foreign Exchange Settlement Methods; Secretary Lin is Decided to Be Responsible for Drafting a Solution</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Representatives from ten industrial trade associations, including rubber, velvet textile, paper making, silk weaving, cement, leather, and camel velvet, including Hong Nianzu, Cheng Nianpeng, Tang Junyuan, Jin Runxiang, Cai Xintao, Shi Naixiu, Xi Zhengxiu, Zhang Shanzhang, and Chen Youyun, visited President Zhang of the National Bank at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss the issue of foreign exchange settlement for the limited import quotas in the first and second quarters. The president received them. Hong Nianzu and Jin Runxiang were selected from among the representatives to state the purpose of the visit to President Zhang, and hoped that for the sake of the production costs of the entire industrial sector and the continued import of production tools, the limited import quotas already obtained by the various industries in the first and second quarters would still be settled at the official price.</p>
<p>President Zhang said that the main key at present is still the difficulty in the government's source of foreign exchange. He said that in the past, the National Bank lacked contact with the industrial sector. In the current environment, it is necessary to cooperate with each other to study how to overcome the current difficulties. In the end, it was decided to first send Lin Jiyong, secretary of the National Bank, to be responsible for drafting a solution for approval. He also instructed the various associations to elect representatives to keep in touch with Secretary Lin in order to provide reference for drafting a reasonable solution. The representatives were satisfied and left at 6:45 p.m.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Board Meeting Decides on Funds for Purchasing Cotton; A Loan of 4 Billion Yuan is Granted to the Cotton Production Improvement Office</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company held a board meeting last Saturday, which was personally presided over by Chairman Chen Qitian. There were three important discussion items at the meeting: (1) The treatment of textile construction employees. In order to take care of the rank of employees and the treatment of technical personnel, it has been approved by the Executive Yuan to handle it separately. Before the method is announced, the August treatment will be temporarily issued according to the July index. (2) The 800 billion yuan owed by the Ministry of National Defense for military cloth has been promised to be issued in two installments of 250 billion yuan in August and September. However, the company lacks funds to purchase cotton. It has been approved by the Executive Yuan to borrow 1 trillion yuan first, and the national banks and bureaus will allocate it successively when the cotton is purchased. (3) It is estimated that 400,000 dan of improved cotton can be harvested this year. It has been decided that the company will sign a contract with the Cotton Production Improvement Office, and a loan of 4 billion yuan will be granted. The Cotton Production Improvement Office will be responsible for ginning and baling, and the company will still pay the purchase funds.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Allocation of Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company followed the usual practice of jointly allocating yarn on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Committee, allocating a total of 1,703 pieces of yarn of various counts, equivalent to 2,706.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 709 applications from manufacturers.</p>
<p>High Cotton Yarn Price</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with a firm tone. Yarn firms and colleagues had little inventory, and their purchases were very strong. Even people outside the industry were searching and absorbing, and the price was raised very sharply. By closing time, 42-count blue dedication yarn had risen to 184.2 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 yuan compared to Saturday. 20-count special double horse yarn rose by 400,000 yuan, and light double horse yarn rose by 450,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming was raised by 550,000 yuan, and the prices of other coarse yarns also rose by varying degrees from 120,000 to 450,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Recovers</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was weak at the beginning due to scattered retail sales, but then it was stimulated by news of the current situation, and people's hearts were uplifted. Buyers made very strong purchases, and the buying power of both northern and southern customers was particularly strong. The Hankou customers frequently favored drills, and the market was filled with a strong atmosphere of buying. The market finally recovered.</p>
<p>As a result, the price of 12-pound leading fine cloth rose to 470,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to Saturday. After closing, the price was shouted up to 475,000 yuan, and someone bought it. Fine cloths of various grades, such as Wufu, Lan, and Caiqiu Zhenzhong, also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen and other drills were actively sold in Hankou, rising by 12,000 to 20,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, raw cloth, blue cloth, and shilin cloth also showed a strong trend.</p>
<p>Dormant Raw Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market was upbeat due to the rise in cotton yarn prices. Yarn factories, because the price of yarn suddenly improved, were hesitant to sell cotton due to the unstable trend. Although there was demand for cotton, they were unwilling to offer prices, resulting in a dormant market and few transactions. The opening prices of various grades were: Lingbao 2.12 million, Shandong American 1.95 million, and Nantai Cang 1.69 million. The warehouse delivery prices were: Lingbao 2.05 million, Shashi 1.93 million, and Zhou Manzi 3.18 million</p>

It is requested that the alkaline management committee extend the deadline, preferably to September 30. Also, for goods ordered before the establishment of the Import Management Committee, for which the payment has been made with self-prepared foreign currency but have not yet been shipped, how should the application be resolved? The Import Management Committee has accepted the opinion, but the association must provide written procedures. (2) Although a small part of the second quota allocation has been settled, most of it has not yet been settled. Please allocate the delayed amount according to the official foreign exchange price to show fairness. (3) Regarding the registration of goods shipped or arrived in port before August 16 after the implementation of the new regulations, the Import Management Committee is requested to answer the purpose of registration and cancel the previous application procedures.</p>
<p>Rising Cigarette Prices</p>

It is heard that the business focus of each district is still on cotton collection.</p>
<p>Lily Bulbs Slightly Recover</p>
<p>Lily bulbs have fallen too much in price, and the source is weak, while sales are frequent, so the price has slightly recovered by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The opening price yesterday was 680,000 to 690,000 yuan, and the trading price was 670,000 to 680,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Holders Reluctant to Sell, Rayon Prices Rise, Silk Goods Slightly Active Yesterday</h3>

In the afternoon, the highest bid was 7 million yuan, but it eventually fell back to 6.65 million yuan at closing.</p>

Japonica rice was also sluggish, but early *Bao* rice was scarce and remained firm, similar to Bai Yuan new japonica rice.</p>
<p>Flour rose slightly by 1,000 yuan. Factories were very determined to sell due to high raw material costs. Foreign flour remained weak.

<p>The oil market saw very small fluctuations. Not many shipments of raw oil arrived, and it remained firm. Barrelled raw oil was stable.

For soybean oil, the Changguo Kunshan factory had many shipments arriving, and the factory's supply continued, falling by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Price Fluctuations of Woolen Fabrics Over the Years</h3>
<p>The changes in woolen fabrics from 1933 to this year have been extremely large. The general trends of prices over the years are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>On May 1, 1933, the tael system was abolished and replaced with the yuan. On the 22nd, the new tariff regulations were announced. The standard prices of woolen fabrics were still lower than the previous year because of the large number of goods arriving from the East and the West.</p>
<p>In July 1937, the July 7th Incident occurred, and transactions in Shanghai decreased sharply. Imported goods were all stored in bonded warehouses. On August 13th, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and business was suspended for more than half a month. Dealers all sent letters and telegrams to stop or withdraw shipments, and many of the goods in transit were temporarily unloaded at ports such as Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>In 1941, prices of all goods rose due to the situation at home and abroad, causing those with capital to hoard goods. At the same time, the population concentrated in Shanghai, stimulating street sales, and sales to customers were also active due to improved transportation. Imported woolen fabrics and other goods were difficult to transport, making local woolen fabrics the darlings of the market. Hoarders made huge profits, and more and more people inside and outside the industry switched to speculating. On December 8th, enemy troops entered the concession, and the woolen fabric market suddenly declined. Although Hong Kong had fallen and the war had begun, cutting off supplies, prices were unable to rise due to the end-of-year period.</p>
<p>In 1942, the enemy puppet regime ordered the use of puppet currency at a ratio of 2:1, and woolen fabric prices rose daily. The public had no confidence in the puppet currency, and the trend of hoarding and speculation became even more intense.</p>
<p>In February and March 1945, market prices once fell, with most falling within the price limits, and wholesale and retail sales both decreased significantly. After mid-April, prices suddenly soared due to rumors in the market after the death of US President Roosevelt, and news of favorable purchases spread, believing that woolen fabric prices would definitely rise, with even more intense increases in July and August. On August 15th, Japan formally surrendered unconditionally, and the Allied Nations won a great victory, and prices finally turned sharply downward. On October 1st, all buying and selling was changed to the legal tender as the standard, but due to rising postal rates, train fares, boat prices, water and electricity, and public service fees, as well as the large number of people from the inland areas coming to Shanghai to make clothes, coupled with the lack of production by factories, prices continued to soar.</p>
<p>This year, due to various environmental factors and the impact of soaring prices of gold, rice, daily necessities, and other goods, woolen fabric prices all soared. Local goods were the only ones that did not increase in price.</p>
<p>Recently, the China Trust Bureau has shipped in large quantities of Japanese woolen fabrics, and many private goods from Hong Kong have also been shipped to Shanghai. At the same time, it is the hot summer season, and the actual sales to retail customers have declined, and the market has slightly weakened.</p>

<h3>Corrections Regarding the Yin Dynasty Calendar</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Professor Lu Shixian's recent book, "Corrections and Explanations of the Yin Dynasty Calendar," is a rebuttal of Mr. Dong Yantang (Zuobin), a researcher at the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica, and his "Yin Dynasty Calendar." Mr. Dong's book took more than ten years to complete and is regarded as a great achievement in academic circles. Mr. Fu Mengzhen (Sinian) wrote the preface, stating, "Mr. Yantang's scholarship is respected in the world. If later students do not come forward with courage, how can they show themselves? It is like the story of Tang Monk's journey to the West, where he encounters monsters and gods everywhere, trying to get a piece of the pie. To evaluate this book comprehensively, there are some prerequisites: first, the person must be as familiar with oracle bone inscriptions as Mr. Yantang; second, the person must have the same knowledge of calendar systems as Mr. Yantang; third, the person must spend several years of effort. But this is absolutely impossible." It is not that "absolutely impossible things" do not exist; there are many examples. Let's take Mr. Lu's book as an example. Mr. Lu is an authority on contemporary calendar studies, and he is also well-versed in the four classics and deeply knowledgeable in bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions. Therefore, his criticisms and arguments are extremely precise. He thoroughly examines Mr. Dong's theories on periodization, the system of sacrifices, the calendar system used, the determined dates, and the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze artifacts used as evidence. The entire book is more than 100,000 words long and includes 57 ancient calendar tables. It is based purely on an objective attitude and expressed in elegant and incisive writing, with no superfluous words or ambiguous statements. Its breadth of comprehensiveness and rigor of structure are rare in academic works of the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The "Corrections" are divided into two parts, upper and lower. The upper part begins: "In the midsummer of the year *Yi You*, Mr. Dong Zuobin published his "Yin Dynasty Calendar," listed as ten tables, divided into two series, with a total of fourteen volumes. It uses oracle bone inscriptions to list the calendar of the Yin Dynasty and is the result of ten years of thought. For the calendar, it provides detailed information from the time of Pan Geng to the present. For the oracle bone inscriptions, it gathers scattered fragments from the time of Wu Ding onwards. The calendar relies on oracle bone inscriptions for verification, and the oracle bone inscriptions rely on the calendar for classification. Some believe that the rituals of the Yin and Shang dynasties and the conquests of the barbarians are clearly presented as a chronological history. Others say that the author has organized the scattered fragments and clarified the obscure, just like 'sewing a coat of hundreds of patches and stringing together a necklace of nine-bend pearls.' It is truly a great and difficult undertaking, and a precious classic for the academic community. I heard that this book was being compiled and refined, and it had already gained a reputation in academic circles. When the work was finally completed, everyone marveled at it as a great creation. In my humble opinion, there are many doubts, so I do not avoid directness and present my humble views. I hope to gain a true understanding of the truth and not dare to deliberately be different. In the most general terms, there are three categories: the years cannot be verified, there is no evidence for the Yin Dynasty calendar, and the oracle bone inscriptions are difficult to rely on. Although this is a summary of the main points and a discussion of the general principles, it comprehensively covers Mr. Dong's arguments. The so-called 'evaluating the entire book' is nothing more than this." From this, the main outline of Mr. Lu's book can be seen.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the upper part reads: "Based on the example of the entire book, the year sequence and calendar calculations are like the surface, while the oracle bone inscriptions and bronze artifacts used as evidence are like the water clock and official records. If the surface is tilted, the water clock will be inaccurate; if the tassel is disordered, the court positions will be misplaced. These are mutually referencing and cannot tolerate even the slightest error. Moreover, the meanings of these three, whether in general or in detail, are repeatedly contradictory. Therefore, the main purpose of the entire compilation cannot be supported by a single word. It is wounded all over, and it is difficult to apply acupuncture. Anyone with a basic understanding of literature can see its flaws. Examining its arguments, the words of doubt are turned into solid evidence. Examining its evidence, the author uses his own theories to provide far-fetched explanations. He has not been able to conduct extensive and detailed research, and he has not seen the many different opinions. If it is said that writing should be concise, then its redundancy is excessive. Such a discussion is inherently worthless. It is only because the ignorant see it as reasonable and the sycophants praise it as innovative that I do not hesitate to waste my time to write this criticism. In short, any year dating on bronze inscriptions is like drawing ghosts, and any dating of oracle bone inscriptions is like catching wind. And yet, the author speaks with detail, as if he had personally witnessed it; he arranges the months and days in greater detail than the historical records of past dynasties. He does not know that the unproven accusations cannot convince people, and the imagined stories cannot be trusted. And yet, he boasts of solid evidence and makes unfounded judgments without doubt; he has repeatedly seen chapters but does not examine them in detail. This is because he is blinded by preconceptions, which cannot be excused. Even his theories are crude and contradictory, probably because the writing was rushed and not thorough. As for the use of calendar calculations and the assistance of astronomers, there are precedents in ancient times, such as the "Huainanzi" and "Lüshi Chunqiu," which are not blameworthy. The entire book is based on theories that are mostly plagiarized from others without attribution, which is also a common practice. Matters of this kind are all excusable, but the flatterers praise them as 'thoroughly understanding' and 'well-versed,' and laud them as 'respected by the world,' which is an exaggeration and cannot be excused. If questioned by the author, he would not admit it himself. Using this to bully others is ridiculous and laughable. Moreover, they say that no one can dispel the darkness, which is absolutely impossible. It should be displayed at the gates of the country and cannot be added to or subtracted from. This is simply foolishness and delusion, and it is a vain threat to the public and cannot be discussed with!" It can be seen that Mr. Lu wrote this book because he was provoked by Mr. Dong's excessive "self-praise" and Mr. Fu's deliberate "bullying" of others. What is the purpose of criticism? To correct falsehoods. Whether this is right or wrong remains to be seen. Originally, the intention of Mr. Fu and Mr. Dong seemed to be to establish absolute authority in academics, implicitly considering themselves as the elite of the academic world. Professor Liu Chaoyang, who studies the new calendar, has already written "Doubts on the Yin Dynasty Calendar," "Further Discussion on the Yin Dynasty Calendar," and "Third Discussion on the Yin Dynasty Calendar." Professor Lu Shixian, who studies the ancient calendar, has also written "Corrections and Explanations of the Yin Dynasty Calendar." Are Mr. Liu and Mr. Lu like the Allied commanders entering Rome to capture Berlin? This is truly a great story in academic history.</p>
<p>The lower part of "Corrections" takes Mr. Dong's calendar table for the sixth year of the reign of Zu Jia and compares it with 57 kinds of calendar calculations from ancient times. Mr. Lu's preface states: "After the writing was completed, I took the calendar calculations of various dynasties, calculated the solstices and equinoxes, and included them in the lower part to see the similarities and differences and to distinguish the gains and losses. The year studied is the sixth year of the reign of Zu Jia, as mentioned by Mr. Dong; the calendars selected include the explicit records in historical documents. There are also some calendar systems whose calculations are not detailed but have been verified by previous scholars. If they are found to be correct, they are also listed. As for the corrections made by various scholars and my own supplements, they are available in various books and can be consulted for reference, so I will not quote them here to avoid redundancy. As for the Zheng Yuan and Zhang Mengbin calendars, although they have been supplemented, they are still questionable. Such cases are not included. The book of *Ren Dun* mentions calendar calculations but only shows contradictions and is not worth mentioning. Since the late Ming Dynasty, private calendars have been quite numerous, either following the old systems or adopting Western methods, but they have all changed the basic elements and have not been verified by actual measurements. Such cases are also excluded. There are also some calendars that have different names but the same calculations; there are also calendars that are contemporary but have slightly different remainders, but the solstices and equinoxes are the same. For example, the Five Periods calendar of the Tang Dynasty is no different from the Linde calendar; the Datong calendar of the Ming Dynasty is a copy of the Shoushi calendar. Also, the Taichu calendar of the Han Dynasty completely copied the Zhou calendar. Although their accumulated years are different, the solstices and equinoxes are the same. The Daming calendar of the Jin Dynasty was created by Yang Ji, and its accumulated years are more than that of Zhao, but because the calculations are the same, only the remainder of the month is slightly different. For cases of this kind, I only selected one example to show the two calendars. The contents of this part are not repeated. In some calculations that do not start from the winter solstice, there are the *Zhuan Xu* calendar of the Qin Dynasty and the Yuanjia calendar of the Song Dynasty. The *Zhuan Xu* calendar starts counting from the beginning of spring because its intercalation of leap months is not based on the absence of the middle *qi*, so it is excluded from the other calendars. Although the Yuanjia calendar starts counting from the spring equinox, this part traces back to the winter solstice for inclusion. The reason for standardizing the units is to facilitate the comparison of similarities and differences." Mr. Lu compares the calendars of various dynasties with the "Yin Dynasty Calendar" to prove the similarities and differences and to clarify the gains and losses. It uses purely objective calculations to measure them. How will Mr. Dong, who is said to "thoroughly understand calendar systems," respond? And the "absolutely impossible thing" has actually happened. How will Mr. Fu deny it?</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's book will be printed by lithography. If any publisher is willing to undertake the printing, Mr. Lu is willing to transfer the copyright. Mr. Lu humbly places himself in the ranks of "later students," implying that Mr. Fu and Mr. Dong, who consider themselves teachers and veterans, will have strict instructions regarding the publication of Mr. Lu's book?</p>
<p>I have briefly stated my humble opinions on Mr. Dong's and Mr. Lu's books in my long poem "Turtle Calendar Song," which I will not repeat here.</p>
<h3>Love of Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— Ge Shangde</p>
<p>I long for Zhenjiang, I long for Zhenjiang, the old touring ground of nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang, in the pages of history, has condensed into many stories that make people yearn for: the hermit Jiao Guang of Jiao Mountain at the end of the Han Dynasty; the Wudi's temporary capital of Dantu; the Jin prisoner - Fu Jian's subordinate - imprisoned in Jinshan; Madam Liang's drumming in the Yuan Shu campaign; ... These stories evoke nostalgia in people's hearts.</p>
<p>The majestic mountains and rivers and the beautiful scenery adorn a stage for the protagonists in the above stories to gallop across or to roam in seclusion; at the same time, these majestic mountains and rivers, this beautiful scenery, are precisely for us, for our children and grandchildren, to forever support pride and arrogance.</p>
<p>During a not-so-brief period of life in Zhenjiang, I am confident that I have indeed explored the great and sublime soul of Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>On many evenings, I took the time to stroll to the top of Beigushan in the north of the city to conduct a thorough inspection, to gaze attentively into the distance, and to read books in silence. The tower said to be dressed by Mrs. Sun, the stone said to have been tested by Liu Xuande's sword, the slope said to have been driven by Xuande and Sun Zhongmou, and the Wangjiang Pavilion said to be the place where Mrs. Sun threw herself into the river, are scattered on the hillside and the top of the mountain, reminding people of the active posture of the ancient heroes. One evening after a heavy snow, I leaned in the Wangjiang Pavilion, reading Turgenev's Rudin, sometimes also turning my eyes leisurely to the opposite side of the river with the snow.</p>
<p>On many holidays, I bought a boat to play on the central Jiao Mountain of the river. Imagining that this is exactly the soil where Jiao Chushi left his footprints, and at the same time looking up at the east flow of the rushing river - a picture of Madam Anguo drumming appears unconsciously again.</p>
<p>On many days, I ran from a distant residence to the top of Jinshan. Here I tasted the glorious victory of our nation defeating Fu Jian and imprisoning the Di prisoners; I proudly roared at the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>At many times, I ran to the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang alone, walking slowly on the sheep gut path between the rolling hills. While reading a book, I often squatted down and picked the small flowers on the roadside and clipped them into the book. I remember those books clearly were short stories by Maupassant and the like.</p>
<p>Although the tide of time has surged and nearly twenty years have passed in an instant; but it has never been able to erode the impression in my heart - the profound impression that the old touring ground of Zhenjiang left me.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang is a beautiful poem of ancient times, a beautiful poem of modern times, and also a beautiful poem of the future.</p>
<p>I miss Zhenjiang, I sing for Zhenjiang with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>The Painter's Wife</h3>
<p>—Kakasso</p>
<p>Pablo Picasso (1881-) is the originator of Cubism and the leader of the modern European art world. The average person only knows that he is a Cubist writer, but unexpectedly, in the salon of 1938, he discovered an extremely classical portrait, which made people feel extraordinarily surprised, so the absurd criticism of "no basic sketches" was wiped out. This also illustrates that Picasso is not unable to paint so vividly, but he is unwilling to waste his precious time in this way. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>My Family's Osmanthus Literature</h3>
<p>— Zha Mengji</p>
<p>In Western literature, the "Osmanthus", which symbolizes victory, is often seen praised endlessly in the chapters of poets. Speaking of China's "Osmanthus", I have not actually verified whether it is a lineage with the laurel, but in terms of its color, fragrance, and taste, it can be regarded as a first-class breed.</p>
<p>In the past, during the imperial examination era, this flower was widely used to compare with the clean and noble imperial examination. The "Zhuangyuan" who "solely occupies the top of the Ao" always wore two golden flowers on his hat. Gold is the true color of "Osmanthus", so it seems that the meaning of the term "laurel crown" in the West is not very different.</p>
<p>Our surname Zha in Haining, almost all the families who study still retain one or two osmanthus branches. The history of my family's osmanthus trees is said to be very strange by the older generations. It is said that our ancestors, whenever a "Xiucai" or higher like "Juren", "Jinshi" and so on appeared, the osmanthus branch in this autumn always flourished especially. A frustrated scholar who had failed many times came to my house to steal a branch of "Osmanthus" back, and that year he actually "passed the exam"; so my family's "Osmanthus" became a wonderful tree in the literary world. Zha Shenxing, the old man of Chu Bai, also mentioned the name "Osmanthus" many times in his "Jingyetang Poetry Collection". He has a poem "Leaving Runmu and following the rhymes sent by my brothers":</p>
<p>"Pointing to Linlu and looking far away, the magpies follow the door in the morning and the crows in the evening. The Paulownia is a tree planted by the ancestors, and the Osmanthus is a flower that passes the exam in my family. The fence behind the house should be repaired with bamboo, and the land west of the wall is barren and suitable for tea. I lack the strength to farm, but I can add to the planting in the book."</p>
<p>There are two self-notes in this poem, and I will put them down now:</p>
<p>(1) "The Paulownia on the pond was planted by my late father, and it has been embraced for twenty years. The Song people called the Han brothers as the 'Paulownia Han family'."</p>
<p>(2) "My family originally had five silver osmanthus trees. Since Guiyou, whenever there is an imperial examination, if the brothers, nephews, and nephews get outstanding results, a branch of golden flowers will be sent as a precursor, which has always been accurate."</p>
<p>The "Runmu" mentioned in the poem title is Siting, the younger brother of the old man of Chu Bai, a famous figure in the literary inquisition of the Qing Dynasty. The "younger brother" mentioned is the second younger brother Si, also known as Deyin. He has a poem "For Deyin Title Zhapu Study Picture":</p>
<p>"Two oblique suns pass over the wall, after class, I often watch the shadow of the osmanthus move; this tree has been full of life in recent years, how can I talk about the time when I was a child when I was old?"</p>
<p>This poem also has a self-note:</p>
<p>"The small room on the east side of the hall is where I and my younger brother studied when we were young. There is an old osmanthus tree in the yard. Every time I watch the shadow of the tree on the wall, it is time to leave school,</p>
<p>Now the osmanthus has been used as firewood".</p>
<p>Also, the poem "Deyin Fake Goes Out to Allude to Don't":</p>
<p>"Planting Osmanthus and Transplanting Pine have been for two years, and I often send letters home to ask about the western tomb. How easy is it to talk about the two acres in Luoyang? I am a little happy that I have a tomb field for farming".</p>
<p>He often talks about Osmanthus, and he often reflects his own changing life from Osmanthus. I introduce this school of "Osmanthus Literature" to the readers, and by the way, I tell you: After the imperial examination declined with the trend of the times, the value of "Osmanthus" was not affected by anything. Now the old women in my hometown still worship "Osmanthus" as before, and the rise and fall of Osmanthus is enough to predict the legend of the rise and fall of the family, which is still mixed with feng shui divination from "Osmanthus Literature" to a "Osmanthus Philosophy" and popular in the village of "Osmanthus fragrans".</p>
<h3>A Slice of Our Land, A Drop of Our Blood 385</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun was still making tight turns when a sharp, piercing whistle came from the sky, the signal of Little Tiger; the whistling sound crashed against the mountain walls on both sides, creating cyclical echoes, as if the entire valley was filled with people whistling in the same way, a continuous and piercing sound. When Yaoqun heard this signal, she suddenly realized that the old fort must have received news of their return and sent people out to meet them, who happened to run into Little Tiger, so they came rushing over together. Thinking of this, she felt happy and immediately loosened the reins and rode forward; at the same time, she let out a long whistle in response to Little Tiger's signal.</p>
<p>The speed of both sides running towards each other was like a storm, and the momentum was at its peak; so, such a long distance would soon be covered. The closer they got, the clearer Yaoqun could see; it was soon confirmed that her guess was correct. From a distance, the other group seemed to be riding in single file, with their horses closely following each other due to the straight line obscuring the relative positions. But as they got closer, it became clear that there was a long distance between the first rider and the second or third.</p>
<p>Yaoqun saw that the approaching riders were not far away, about sixty to ninety feet or so, and gently tugged on the reins, preparing to slow down. But the first rider on the other side had the same idea, but acted faster, pulling back so sharply that the horse's hind legs dug into the ground, its front half rising and falling as it spun in place.</p>
<p>"Elder... Aunt Ji!" Little Tiger whistled, calling out to Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"Hey..." Yaoqun replied as she slowed her charge. "Who is it?" She was eager to know who was coming.</p>
<p>Before Yaoqun could finish speaking, her horse had already run close to Little Tiger. Before Little Tiger's answer could be heard clearly, the two riders behind him had already reached Little Tiger's side; their horses' momentum had not completely stopped when the riders jumped off their backs, ran a few steps, and stood together on the side of the road:</p>
<p>"Hello, Miss!... " A loud, booming voice greeted Yaoqun first: "Greetings to you!... The fort received word early, knowing that you two have glor... glor... gloriously returned!" The word "gloriously returned" seemed to be a spur-of-the-moment invention, not very smoothly delivered.</p>
<p>"Hey... Old Neng?" Yaoqun was only about six feet away from the speaker. "Is that Master Wu Er?"... The person didn't speak, and in the moonlight, she couldn't see clearly, so Yaoqun could only guess.</p>

<h3>People of Color</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally protest the Shen Chong case, hoping to obtain a "fair" reply. White Americans who are raped by black men are sentenced to death, while white American sailors who rape Chinese women in China are given lenient sentences.</p>
<p>But American and British discrimination against people of color is world-renowned. In Xiao Qian's "Life Interviews," the author encounters a secret goddess in England, but even she abandoned her business because the author was a yellow person.</p>
<p>And John Gunther's "Inside U.S.A." reveals the truth about Americans' mistreatment of black people, saying:</p>
<p>"Shortly before the end of World War II, someone asked a black girl how she planned to punish Hitler, and she replied, 'Paint him black and bring him here.' " (Black and white people in the United States are segregated).</p>
<p>It also says that two young black men were "suspected" of breaking into a white woman's house, but were released due to insufficient evidence. But these two black men were captured by a group of unidentified people and executed with cruel punishments; one had both hands chopped off and was burned to death with a welding iron on his head and body; the other was seriously injured and barely survived.</p>
<p>The case had no follow-up and no one investigated it.</p>
<p>There are a total of thirteen million black people in the United States, who suffer physical and mental abuse from white people.</p>
<p>No wonder American sailors can rape our dignified Peking University students and get away with light sentences, deemed insufficient evidence, and acquitted.</p>
<p>But the Chinese are not slaves in the black areas of America; they are allies who fought alongside them against the war of violence!</p>

<h3>Relief of Kuanglu</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>When you are caught in a sudden mountain rain, sitting in a sedan chair, walking on a rugged and winding slope, turning left to see a peak and turning right to encounter a valley, you may have a thought: "These mountains may never end." Because at a juncture where there seems to be no road and no people in sight, you may suddenly step onto a flat road, and as the path twists and turns, amidst the shade of green trees and a few red tiles, you may not feel as if you have already ascended to immortality?</p>
<p>But just when you feel that two peaks stand facing each other, with a wide path in between, suddenly there is another steep slope upwards, with a sheer cliff on one side and a pond below on the other. At this time, with the wind whistling through the pines and strange birds chirping, how can you not feel a sense of fear? Especially when you look ahead, clouds rise from under your feet, soaring up like white silk, instantly engulfing the myriad valleys and peaks. But, for a short time of only one or two minutes, or at most five to ten minutes, this cloud will immediately dissipate, and before your eyes is a scene of openness. If you have been to Lushan, you will know the wonderful sight of clouds covering the sky when viewed from the mountainside, and at the same time, you will have admired the beautiful lake scenery from the mountaintop after the clouds have cleared. Since ancient times, Lushan has given people a dreamlike feeling, a mysterious and intriguing charm. Su Dongpo once wrote a famous line about Lushan: "Viewed horizontally, it becomes a ridge; viewed sideways, it becomes a peak; viewed from different places, the mountains are different. I cannot recognize the true face of Lushan, because I am in the midst of the mountain." To this day, we cannot find a single book that describes the true face of Lushan, which is enough to show that Lushan is a mystery.</p>
<p>Why is Lushan a mystery? Why are there sudden clouds? And why are there mists that cannot be driven away? The biggest reason is that it is close to the river and borders the lake, gathering the essence of rivers and lakes. The vastness of the Yangtze River and the beauty of Poyang Lake set off the majestic and unique Lushan in a misty rain.</p>
<p>The highest peak of Lushan is 1,543 meters high, named Dahanyang Peak. Some say that climbing Dahanyang Peak and looking around at the peaks, even the Five Old Men Peak, the main peak of Lushan, seems to bow down. The height of Dahanyang Peak is equal to the highest point of Mount Tai, and the peak is flat and sparsely wooded. Looking down, the wilderness is vast and boundless, truly unfathomable. Because the place is too high, there are often clouds and mists, so climbing to the top and looking around, the waters of the Yangtze River and the mists of Pengli converge into clouds and mists, appearing and disappearing, creating a magnificent scene. It is said that if you visit on a clear day, you can see the misty trees of Hanyang in the distance. At the same time, there is a cliff in front of the peak, called Yuwang Cliff, which is said to be where King Yu of Xia Dynasty climbed when he was taming the floods, but this is naturally a speculation.</p>
<p>The main peak of Lushan, the Five Old Men Peak, originally came from one mountain, with a distance of about half a mile to three-quarters of a mile between them. The five peaks are equally steep and majestic. On the top of the third peak, there is a stone inscription "The sun is close and the clouds are low," which shows the momentum after climbing the peak. There is a descriptive sentence "Walking touches the birthplace of clouds, the body is level with flying birds" which is indeed a realistic sentence. Below the Five Old Men Peak are five small peaks, and there is also the Five Old Men Cave, all scenic spots in Lushan, but unfortunately they are extremely dangerous, and it is said that fierce beasts appear and disappear unpredictably, so few tourists who arrive at Guling visit the Five Old Men Peak.</p>
<p>Besides the mountain peaks, the various waterfalls are also a spectacle, such as Yuyuan, Three-Tier Spring, Qingyu Gorge, Yulian Spring, Gulian Spring, Wangjiapo Waterfall, and Shimenjian Waterfall, each with its own majestic and interesting features. However, the reporter was never able to visit them in person, but only listened to the old mountain people tell you about them like describing a magical novel. For example, the Three-Tier Spring, how it comes out from behind the Five Old Men Peak, with only a wisp of white spring like silk, gurgling down, shaped like a galloping horse, with a grand momentum, this is the first tier. The second tier is below the bedrock, and the third tier is further down, reaching a total length of 1,200 feet. There have been tourists who, while climbing and gazing, were suddenly caught in a strong wind and swept into the pool, resulting in death. Another example is Gulian Spring, known as the best in the world, especially the first view, its spectacle lies in the fact that after the spring emerges from its source, it scatters into dozens or hundreds of strands, arranged like jade curtains, with a special flavor when viewed from afar.</p>
<p>Lushan is a magical mountain. The reporter only entered the mountain for four days and naturally does not know its mysteries, but when I open the window in the morning, the valleys are filled with clouds, while at noon, the peaks are full of golden light. In the evening, the sunlight dims and the wind may rise and the clouds surge, bringing a great storm in a moment. By night, the symphony of pine waves and flowing springs plays a rhythmic and tragic song. These are enough for you to understand the magic and mysterious charm of Lushan. I cannot understand it, but after entering the mountain, I can at least experience it. (August 12th)</p>

<h3>Antarctic Expedition</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>U.S. Admiral Richard E. Byrd led an expedition to the icy and snowy Antarctic last winter and made great gains. In the vast area, they discovered many freshwater lakes and mountains that had never been seen before. They took photos from airplanes and drew detailed maps.</p>
<p>Initially, the expedition departed from Norfolk on the east coast aboard the flagship USS Mount Olympus. As the ship crossed the equator, winter clothing was distributed to the crew. When passing Cape Horn, the weather was already very cold. When the flagship stopped to refuel, seals sleeping on the ice could be seen from the deck. They had never seen humans before, so when the photographer's lens was pointed at them, some quickly left, while the rest showed surprised eyes, looking straight at the camera.</p>
<p>From Cape Horn onwards, the other accompanying oil tankers, submarines, and other ships returned to the United States. Only a strong icebreaker led the flagship and two transport ships through the frozen Ross Sea, heading towards the destination – Little America in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Amidst fierce resistance from the ice, the Mount Olympus sailed into the port of Little America. The crew quickly set up camp using tractors in the "Antarctic summer" (above zero degrees), and used physics to build snow walls in front of the entrance as windbreaks. One hundred and ninety-seven expedition members began investigation and research work in a new way of life.</p>
<p>When severe storms struck the camp, all work was suspended, all equipment was frozen, and the aircraft lay dormant in the ice. Many people who were not accustomed to this environment lost their vitality for hours.</p>
<p>To protect the staff's faces from excessive cold, they wore masks with heating tubes, otherwise the air exhaled from their nostrils would instantly freeze into ice beads on their beards, because the mercury on the thermometer was pointing at minus twenty-three degrees!</p>
<p>"The gateway to Antarctica is made of icebergs, some as high as two hundred feet," Byrd reported upon his return. "Therefore, the radar operators must work all day to break through this obstacle." Message to: Mr. Fang Ren and Mr. Zheng Hongji: Please indicate your address so that we can send you the manuscript fee slip. The original address is unknown and has been returned.

<h3>The Mischievous A-Mi (11)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>The American Unemployment Board</p>
<p>You must find the term "Unemployment Board" very unfamiliar, but you must also find it very interesting. Hearing that unemployed people can receive $80 in unemployment benefits each month must be surprising. Being unemployed with $80 a month in income is much richer than a Chinese university professor who is not unemployed. China does not have an unemployment board, only employment agencies, which are obligated to introduce jobs but are not responsible for success or failure. If you starve to death before being introduced to a job, that's your own fault. The style of the American Unemployment Board is very different. The board puts the responsibility for people's unemployment on the government's head, truly saying, "The people's unemployment is my responsibility" (this sentence is made up by the author; it is not found in the Four Books and Five Classics). Because the people have fulfilled their obligation to pay taxes, the government must solve their livelihood problems. This leads to the genuine issue of people's livelihood. The Unemployment Board is available in every county. At the entrance of the Unemployment Board are notices advertising talent waiting to be hired, and there are also frequent advertisements in the local newspapers for talent waiting to be hired. Anyone who is unemployed can register with the Unemployment Board and receive a monthly stipend of $80 until they find a job. However, if they introduce you to a suitable job and you are lazy and do not go to work, and they find out, you will no longer receive your stipend. Americans like to work and do not want to receive handouts, so once they find a job, they no longer receive the stipend. This system only works in America. First, when all institutions, companies, and stores need talent, they never pull in their maternal uncles and nephews, that is, they do not have any personal bad habits, so all the talent at the Unemployment Board has a way out; second, there are many emerging industries in America, which require a large number of talent, so the Unemployment Board actually laments the lack of talent, having a large amount of unemployment benefits but not enough unemployed people to receive them; third, Americans are rich in the spirit of self-reliance, and there are not many people who are willing to be unemployed and sit and receive ready-made stipends. Except for the elderly, disabled, and sick who must rely on stipends for life, those with work skills would rather work and take $79 than be idle and take $80. $80 in US dollars is worth almost 4 million yuan at the black market rate, enough to go dancing all night. If China also had an unemployment board issuing stipends, the number of unemployed people in China would definitely increase. The Unemployment Board is a losing business. Americans pay attention to business, so why do they have to do this losing business? They lose this small amount of capital, but they prevent people from taking risks due to unemployment. This is a method of doing a losing small business to protect a big business. Ask yourself, if society is unstable, can you make a fortune in peace? America no longer has national disasters, so it is impossible to make a fortune from national disasters. Americans' strength is foresight and willingness to invest capital, like the Lend-Lease Act, a huge amount of capital that only Americans are willing to invest, which ultimately brought them markets in various countries. If you say they are stupid, you are the stupid one. Americans usually spend five cents to buy you a bottle of Coca-Cola, but they also weigh the value of those five cents. Do you think they are stupid? The Unemployment Board is a clever facility, worth adopting. (43)</p>

<h3>Australian Mr. Ban Tai'er Seeks Friends Overseas, Knowing Each Other Across the World Is Like Living Next Door</h3>
<p>We recently received a letter from Mr. Ban Tai'er of Queensland, Australia, seeking Chinese friends and hoping to exchange photos, stamps, and other items. Mr. Ban Tai'er is fascinated by Chinese culture and especially admires this newspaper. A long-distance letter is very precious. The following is a partial translation of the letter. Editor.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Thanks to an introduction from a Chinese friend, I learned that your newspaper has a history of seventy-five years. Not only does it hold a leading position in the Chinese news industry, but it also enjoys a high reputation in the world of newspapers.</p>
<p>I express my sincere respect and admiration for your country's culture. This has been a long-cherished desire in my heart, hoping to obtain some Chinese friends. I sincerely hope that every Chinese person who reads this letter can give me a letter and start our friendship.</p>

<h3>Disputes Arising from Land Leases for House Building Cause Relatives to Fall Out and Almost Lead to Litigation</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have a piece of vacant land that I leased to a relative, Mr. So-and-so, in 1927 to build six tile-roofed houses. In 1929, a contract was signed stipulating an annual land rent of six yuan and a term of ten years, after which I would have the right to redeem the houses. Later, I left Shanghai due to the War of Resistance and returned home after the victory, which was many years overdue. I originally intended to ask a middleman to assess the price and redeem the houses, but Mr. So-and-so insisted on redeeming the houses by converting the current rice price to the construction cost at that time, due to the different currency system. We have been at loggerheads until now without a resolution. I have several doubts about this: (1) Is his coercion legal, and is there any explicit provision? (2) If I want to sue in court, what procedures must I follow?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) Since the lease term has expired, the tenant agrees to redeem the houses at a price, but demands an increased payment based on the depreciation of the currency. According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation for the Restoration of Order, the other party's claim is not unreasonable. The law does not specify how much the increase in payment should be. In general, the court often orders performance at a thousand times the original amount. (2) For lawsuits involving real estate rights, the court with jurisdiction is exclusively the court where the real estate is located. To sue for a judgment ordering the return of the leased property, litigation costs must be paid at a rate of 13 per thousand of the assessed value of the disputed subject matter.</p>
