<p>〔本報長春十八日電〕吉　綫九台東南兩面感受威脅，國軍刻在土們嶺及波泥河子附近與共軍激戰，守樺皮廠及鴨通河之保安團，已退守土們嶺，　陽附近集結共軍甚衆，企圖進犯九台</p>
<p>吉長綫掃蕩奏捷　國軍正分路追擊</p>
<p>〔中央社吉林十八日電〕烏拉街共軍南犯甚急，連日九站（吉長鐵路綫上自吉林起第二站）以北之上下通氣一帶，戰事頗烈，共軍以熾盛火力，向南猛衝，我軍以逸待勞，沉着應戰，共軍傷亡甚衆，不支，緩緩向北撤去，十七日午我先頭部隊已進至九站以北廿餘里上下通氣一帶。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十七日電〕軍息：綜合近日吉長綫兩側軍議動態勢，共軍顯欲切斷吉長間交通，以威脅吉長，而策應四平，但長春，九合，吉林三地國軍早鋻及此，即派出掃蕩部隊，分路出擊吉林綫以南三角地帶，將十五日晨一度爲共軍攻陷之吉林西方孤店子車站收復，共軍即向大荒地潰退，九台出擊國軍，則掃蕩至　皮廠附近，與共軍激戰，至十六日，共軍不支退去，該部國軍乃與由吉林西進國軍會師。土們嶺附近雖亦有共蠶動，同時大荒地方共軍猶思南犯，但國軍掃蕩部隊已嚴密控制該地帶，鐵路綫以南國軍掃蕩部隊，則於十六日上午進駐岔路河，共軍四散潰退，刻國軍正分路追擊中。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕旅大視察團張劍非，朱新民，葉　寺六人，十八日下午四時自瀋飛抵平，定廿日飛京，向中樞報告視察經過。張劍非稱：在未向中樞報告前，不便發表任何意見，並稱：在旅大與當地行政組織無正式接觸。葉楠稱：「去看看旅大，總比不看好」。某團員笑稱蘇方對彼等招待保護之週密。據悉：彼等抵達大連後，被招待於國際聯歡社旅館中，大連港口泊蘇艦，市內未見軍隊，由警察維持秩序，街上行人寡少，學生甚多，惟市面殊蕭條，建築物間有破壞，全市人口有六十萬人。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕張劍非十八日午一時飛平轉京，報告視察經過，同去者有葉楠，朱新民，陳思永，徐祖善等，董彥平因公忙，中止前往。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕旅大視察團歸來後，避免透露任何具體消息，據由側面獲悉，視察國所遭遇唯一之困難，為蘇方邀請政府認係偽組織之關東公署，旅大兩市府及金顯等地方機關負責人如遲子祥，徐憲齊，陳云濤，任仲夷等參加並演說，遲等着大禮服，滿面烟容，演說行動均係預定計劃。又宴會中舉杯慶祝時，視察團亦遭受難堪，招待所門前等處所貼之標語，有擁護孫中山聯俄三政策，擁護中蘇友好等詞句。</p>

<h3>北塔山屬我版圖　莫斯科廣播外蒙聲明絕對無稽　董局長昨發表嚴正聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕關於北塔山事件，新聞局長董顯光十八日代表政府作如下之聲明：「北塔山地區之在新疆省界內，為中國領土，實無絲毫疑問。無論在一九四五年中蘇條約簽訂之前或以後，北塔山向由新疆省設防，該地向有新疆省府所設之警察局及駐防之軍隊。</p>
<p>對於莫斯科廣播中所稱中國軍隊曾越過新疆邊界，進入外蒙一點，本人必須嚴正否認。莫斯科所廣播之外蒙外長聲明，實屬絕對無稽之談。</p>
<p>在外蒙及蘇聯政府正式答覆以前，本人不欲多言？祗欲再度聲明，北塔山事件並非尋常達境事件或疆界爭執，而係與廣泛意義之政治問題有關」。</p>
<h3>美使館否認　眞理報消息</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕美大使館十八日否認蘇眞理報所傳新疆事件係美國指使之說，據使館新聞專員美爾尊語記者，美方對蘇報所傳一切「全無所悉」。</p>
<h3>共軍中有韓共日俘　純粹內戰是否如此　新聞局記者會上一問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕十八日下午四時半，政院新聞局例行之記者招待會席上，本報社長潘公展曾提出三項問題，請董局長答覆。潘氏係於該會進行至一半時蒞塲，表示以記者身份參加。董局長介紹潘氏時稱，舊日為中宣部同事瀋副部長，現為滬市參會議長。旋稱：「吾人歡迎潘議長講幾句親善的話」。潘氏稱：「本人係以記者資格來此參加，乃有問題欲詢董局長者」。潘氏續稱：「本人適自滬來，曾見一鉛印之傳單，標題為「中共權威人士論目前時局」，末署新華社五月三十日陝北電。本人所問者，即中央電台會否收到此項廣播？此種宣傳品，何以能在此問隨便散發？其內容克將所有國家靑屬法西斯之語句均加於政府。如曾經收到，政府應取何種態度」？潘氏說明時，特將此項文件示衆，董接讀後稱，此項文件政府到現在為止並未收到。政府對此最好辦法為置之不理，因一且理會，被等將認爲有所收穫，惟有置之不理，彼等即將華頭喪氣。董氏續稱：「在余極迅速之閱讀下，認為此文不僅為　政府，且有桃撥中美邦交之處」。潘氏續提出第二問題謂，一般人均口口聲聲稱反內戰，學生亦說反內戰，吾人閱戰報載有東北方面共軍中有韓共，有日俘，以及此次北塔山事件等，此類事件究係何種性質，純粹內戰是否即如此？董即就對新疆事件之書面聲明（見另條）予以宣讀。潘氏續詢第三問題謂，美國對新疆事件之發生，究採何種態度？美援華情形如何？美對土與希借款均已應允，對我國借款何以遲遲無結果？董氏重述前次對記者詢問之答覆：「美允讓我之五憶美元之剩餘物資，至五月底，我收到者僅值二千萬美元，為數有限。我所能得到美國援助如何，實屬顯然。關於借款事，現無新消息。董氏並稱：此乃非常「煩悶」之事。又有問以蘇聯拒我接收旅大，政府如何表示？董氏答稱，政府正交涉中。本人無何意見發表。問，北塔山事件發生後，政府是否將眞相公佈？外交途徑有無變更？蘇對我提抗議無答覆，我是否向聯合國控訴：董答：「我沒有辦法答覆」。</p>
<p>鐵路交通情形</p>
<p>顯光答覆記者問</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕新聞局十八日記者招待會中有詢以能將今日中國交通綫之情形與九十日前之比較，作一詳細報告否？</p>
<p>董局長答：自勝利以來，政府竭力恢復及維護重要交通綫，因共黨之擾亂破壞及材料短少，此項工作極為艱辛，往往破壞容易而建設困難。十五日全國一八〇九七公里之鐵路，通車者計為一〇〇五三公里。三個月前，通車者為一一四六八公里，過去九十日中，東北鐵道之通車里程，因戰事影響，自三〇九八公里，减為一八五八公里。在同時期內，隴海鐵路已自三月十六日之一三八六公里，增至現時之一四〇四公里，而津浦鐵路，則自六五一公里，增至六七一公里。另一值得注意之發展，為長達一一八公里之南潯鐵路，已告恢復通車，而浙贛鐵路之通車里程，已自三月十六日之二六四公里，增為六月十五日之四二二公里。全國鐵路，三個月前與今日通車里程之比較，列表如下：</p>
<p>全國鐵路三個月前與目前通車里程對照表（以公里為單位）：（甲）三月十六日通車距離總數一一六二六，計東北三〇九八，關內（僅列舉重要鐵路）膠濟一一七，　浦一〇五〇，北寗四四三，平綏八八二，平古七三，隴海一三八六，正太二七五、同蒲三九八，京滬三三九，浙贛二六四，南潯零，粵漢一一五九。（北寗係指開內一段，關外一段則包括於東北項下。據是日報告，關內段亦已受共軍破壞，里程未悉）。不通車距離總數六三一七一，計東北五八四，關內（僅列重要鐵路）膠濟三三八，津浦四七八，平漢一五六，北寗一九〇，平綏三二〇，平古七五，隴海二一〇，正太零，同浦四九四，京滬三，浙贛七三八，南潯一二八，粵漢零。（乙）六月十五日過事距離總數一〇〇五三，計東北一八五八，關內膠濟一一八，津滿六七二，平漢八〇六，北寗四四三，平綏八八二，平古五七〇，隴海一四〇四，正太四七，同蒲二三五，京滬三三九，浙贛四二二，南　一四八，粵漢一一五九，不通車距離總數八〇五四計東北三八二五，關內膠濟三三八，　浦四五六，平漢五〇〇，北寗零，平綏三〇，平古九八，隴海一九二，正太二二八，同蒲六五七，京滬三，浙贛五八，南　零，粵漢零。</p>
<h3>顧大使訪美副國務卿　商亞洲經濟復興　中美戰債下週開始談判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十七日電：中國駐美大使函　鈞博士，十七日下午往訪美副國務卿克萊頓，會商渝九十分　，對復興亞洲問題有所商討。提議將「馬歇爾經濟援助歐洲計劃」擴展至亞洲，並提出中國分享日本國內工業資產賠償計劃。始談判。顧氏稱：「關於中國政府要求動用美進出口銀行五億美元對華貸款之切實計劃，余已興美官員非正式討論，將在六月卅日最後限期以前正式提出，必要時中國且希望能將載止時期展緩」。</p>
<p>五億美元借疑　正在華府商談</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕我向美接洽之五億美元建設借款，現正在華府談商，據此間關係方面息，此項借款月內有成功可能，聞是項借款中，關於交通事業者佔二分之一，以上數達二億七千五百萬美元，其中尤以鐵路所　者最多，共二億另一百四十萬元，交部方面已電令在美之中國物資供應委會交部代表蕭慶雲，協助顧維鈞進行洽商中。</p>
<h3>從各方面着手　解決新疆問題</h3>
<p>梁寒操在靑年團演講</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕梁寒操十八日午後於公開演講中稱，新疆為我領土，吾人誓予保衛，新疆人民為我同胞，吾人當予救濟，若能盡其在我，一切不難解決。梁氏認為新疆事件不致再有若何大發展，暫時可望解決，惟問題仍存在，欲謀澈底解決，須自外交，内政，經濟各方面分頭努力，就外交言，此次事件之發生，旣牽涉國際關係，處置自應鄭重，並眾孟子所稱「以小事大者畏天者也，畏天者保其國」。我現處美蘇兩大之間，外交應中立，而不偏不倚，內政方面，新民族問題複雜，吾人應把握新人心理，使新人能亨政治民主，並有充分　機會，還胞所歡迎者為工程師，醫學等，而不再歡迎昔日邊陲「大展鴻圖」之統治人物。中央應助當地人士保衛國土，使省政走上合理途徑。最後，就經濟方面言，新省　載極富，據調查奇台一帶藏有製造原子彈之原料　。此外，烏蘇之油鑛，藏甚亦較廿肅所有者為富。吾人應助當她人民從事建設，並加速改善民生問題。上述各點若能辦到。中央與地方關係不難日趲密切，其他問題當不難隨之解決。梁氏曾　任新省黨部主委，對新情勢極熱，今日於中央團部演請，慕名往聽者千餘人。</p>

<h3>普照選時技述問題　內政部注意</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕內部人口局技正張澤仁，十八日就普選過程中製票，投票，開票之技衛問題，對記者談稱：普選即將展開。據統計，全國選民達二億人，故對於選票之印製，投票匭之數額，開票之方式等等，在實際辦理時，不無困難。今作以下數點之研究：（一）製票問題，全國十二個院轄區選民總數約達六百萬人以上，所需投票　應爲一千二百個，此八百餘萬選票及千二百個票　之製造，均須選舉總事務所計劃辦理，然後交各市選舉事務所備用，各縣市局國大選票均應由省選　所製發，依照規定須蓋用省所之關防或印信。吾人概定省所不分晝夜派人輸流，用最快速度蓋印，以每分鐘印六十張，每日蓋印六萬餘張，單以川省二千萬選票計，即須三百日以上，為事實所不允，故吾人就事實觀之，擬分別由各單位印製，由選所派員監督。（二）投票問題，規定投票限於三日內完畢，規定之投票匭樣式為長方體，高一尺八寸，長二尺二寸，寬一尺四寸可容納五千張選票。吾人就投票日期，票匭容量限制等問題，主張每一區大小，亦即每一選所所屬選民數目，應以五千人為標準，可約定為，都市以二保或三保為一區，在大鄉鎭以一鄉鎭為一區，小鄉鎭以二鄉鎭為一區，每區設一個。（三）開票問題，一般之估計，國大立委獲票是多者可達十萬或廿萬以上，如此大數，計算自屬困難，普選計數係用正字，但此數目太大，正字已不易辦理，故擬首以各匭預貼候選人姓名，然後以每千張選票爲一捆，以計算之，自可　簡。</p>
<h3>改建國大會堂　當局未作決定</h3>

<h3>中政會討論時局　各委提出重大決策意見　推孫陳兩委呈總裁核示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕當前時局臨嚴重階段，各方人士均極注意，十八日上午九時舉行之中央政治委會中，曾熱烈提出討論，各委員成認須有作重大決策之必要，紛紛提出意見，結果推請孫　，陳立夫即日將此項意見呈明總裁後，最近期內再行召開臨時會議一次，專門討論此項間題。十八日討論時，發言者甚多，即素極持重之鈕永建氏，亦起立發言，渠稱：大局已極嚴重，應即下決心。其餘各委員發言，一般看法認為共黨已拒絕和談，且與當前之國民政府為敵，而就戰爭中種種跡象觀之，確有牽涉國際背景者，中央實有考量一切情形後，作重大決策之必要　因時局嚴重，不能長此拖延，應採軍事，外交雙管齊下之辦法，不宜常居被動，俾國內外均能對目前局勢更多明瞭。按之實際，我國東北與西北之情况，共軍作戰顯具國際戰爭之離形，我國自應爲民族，爲主權，爲領土完整而下決心，但世界各尤以美國，更應正視現實。杜魯門總統之政策，對歐洲，對遠東不應有所分別。十八日討時間極長，最後因總裁未出度，同時亦無法作結論，故推孫·陳二氏呈總裁核示後，再召集臨時會討論。與會之若干委員，成認十八日之會議極有收獲，有意義，足見諸氏對國是之關切。</p>
<p>普選政黨提名辦法　決提國務會議討論</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕中央政治委會，十八日晨九時舉行例會，孫科主席，首由王外長報告新疆事件之處理經過，對外交涉情形，並談及戰事。繼由最近目東北返京之中央農工部部長馬超　報告東北視察觀感，旋討論時局，並通過提案及內定人事多項，茲擇要者列後：（一）選舉政黨提名辦法。（二）聯業團體立委名額，盼國務會議時予以提出，請酌予增加至一一〇名，因立院通過之五六名，不敷職團分配，（三）教育專門委會提出改革中等教育初步辦法原則。關於人事詞動部分，（一）漢口，廣州，西安，瀋陽四院轄市市　人選，內定除西安市長擬調任陝西省府教廳長王友直担任外，餘三市市長均擬不更動。（二）內定立院副院長由吳鐵城繼任。（三）內定淵源任任駐希臘大使。（四）內定徐繼莊遞補立委。（五）內定邢　　　補監委，以上人事調動，尚待國務會研討論後決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕關於普選時政黨提名辦法，十八日中央政治委會中曾提出討論，並決於國務會議中提出。其辦法擬議為，以參加政府之三黨為限，三黨以外者，如參加選舉，即依選舉法一般之規定。至在憲法貿施後，對政黨如何認定，則由數府參照國家眞例以定。</p>

<h3>遠東經會規程議定　今日舉行全體小組委會　下次大會決於七月十日在紐約召開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國亞洲暨遠東經濟委員會首次大會，昨爲第三日。上午十時半舉行第五次會議，下午二時半舉行第六次會議，均由蔣廷　博土生持。經通過臨時議程，決定該會全體委員會於七月十日在紐約成功湖舉行。並定今晨開始舉行全體小組委員會，專為討論聯合國經濟及社會理事會於本年三月二十八日決議案中第二部門第二節，即：「聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會會議，應負責搜集關於經濟復興更多之資料，並加以調查，如有需要，尚須實地考察，然後將調查結果，向理事會下屆大會提供報告」。</p>
<p>當各國代表在討論上項問題時，會引起熱烈辯論，尤以蘇聯代表史迭辛柯發言　多。</p>
<p>大會之正式工作，於今日方啓端，三日來所討論者均為形式與規程等問題。昨日將規程議定後，今日可正式開始其繁重之任務矣。</p>
<p>茲將昨日會議經過詳　誌後：</p>
<h3>討論臨時議程　一塲熱烈辯論　上午會議未獲結果</h3>
<p>主席蔣延黻於昨晨開會時，即提出第五項議程「討論臨時議程」。印度代表奈魯當即建議：此項議程中應包括下列三點：（一）聯合國亞洲暨遠東經濟委員會會議之會員及組織，（二）地區範圍之變更或增加，（三）該委員會之臨時會址（投上列三點，已由聯合國經濟社會理事會規定於全體委員會在紐約開會時討論。）</p>
<p>奈魯之建議，引起大會中一一種不同意見，相特甚久。奈氏申述意見後，即由沃文答覆稱：關於會址問題，可按三種情形而言：（三）亞洲及遠東經委會之會址將以聯台國機辦遠東辦事處之會址為會址，此點須由聯合國大會決定。（二）在一九四八年以前，臨時會址可由本會（即指亞洲及遠東經委會會議）決定；（三）在未決定前，本會秘書處臨時會址將在上海。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表史迭辛柯同意奈氏建議，臨時議程中，應加列三項：（一）會員，（二）地區範圍，（三）本會之職務。</p>
<p>澳代表吳登發問：如果業經決定由全體委員會討論之問題，本會是否亦可討論？</p>
<p>英代表克羅則謂：本會乃由經濟社會理事會所產生，故應受該會決議案所限制。</p>
<p>史迭辛柯又問：若在紐約舉行之全體委員會乃由本會所產生，則何以其會務須直接向經社理事會報告？</p>
<p>美代裴戴維斯謂：本代表團並未凖備討論蘇代表提出之問題。渠認為如必須討論，則將違反本會認機構之指示，故提議通過原有臨時議程。</p>
<p>史氏表示異議，渠引證所收到之文件，並朗護其中有一點：「經濟及社會理事會要求本會討論此問題」。</p>
<p>中國代表李榦，為緩和兩方面之空氣，乃謂：本會係由經社理事會所產生一點，可毋待實述，故本會似不應超越總機構所現定之議事範圍。渠同時附議兩方面之意見，建議通過原定議程，但印蘇代表之意見；亦可在進行議程時發表，俾以後在紐約全體委員會中提供參考。</p>
<p>印代表奈魯於是贊成通過議程，但不主張討論第六項：成立全體委員會。</p>
<p>戴維斯加以解釋謂：渠之建議並非謂其他代表不可發表意見，但美代表團並未準備討論蘇代表所提出之三點問題，因議程上並未規定對此項問題應有決定性之措施或決議。</p>
<p>至此，主席謂：印代表欲修正議程，取消第六項之「成立全體委員會」一點，本人建議印代表不妨在討論第六項時提議改變全體委員會之性質或組織，同時可提出具體指示。據本人所知，本會雖受經社理事會決議案之限制，但該決議案不能阻止吾人對本會附屬機構有所指示。</p>
<p>法代表摩爾諾稱；各代表之意見中似有所誤會，我人實不應有誤會存在，故主張散會，留待下午再行討論。</p>
<p>主席對散會事付表決。印·蘇·法等四代表贊成，里央·美·菲三代表則反對，請在「少數服提多數」之原則下而宣告散會。下午原定三時開會，英代表克羅以此案急宜結東，建議二時半舉行，當經通過。</p>
<p>印蘇代表提議　表決未獲通過　暹羅代表兩決棄權</p>
<p>下午繼續討論議程問題，史迭辛柯正式提議在議程中加列渠提出之三點。奈魯附議。付表決後，贊成者僅印蘇兩代表，反對者有中·英·美·澳·法·荷·菲·暹等八代表，致未獲通過。乃再表決印代表所提取消「成立全體委員會」之建議，結果亦以二（印蘇）對七遭否決（暹代表棄權）。英代表克羅即提議通過「成立全體委員會」，由菲代表副主席瓜憲請附議，以七對二（印蘇）而獲通過（暹代表又棄權）。</p>
<p>當主席繼續提出議程第七項討論經社理事會決議案時，史迭辛柯即問：如果有一個或數個代表放棄參加全體委員會委員，則該全體委員會是否仍有其全權？主應答稱：此為組織法及法律上之問題，本人不便答覆。乃請沃文解釋，沃氏謂：全體委員會之議程應受本會議事規則之限制。一切會議，除非本會決定不于公開，均應公開。</p>
<p>然後又討論全體委員會在紐約成功湖開會日期，該日期原定本年七月七日召開，後由印代表提出本會結束後再赴紐約參加，恐時間不及，故主張稍遲數天。後即由沃文提議於七月十日，英代表初贊成仍定七日，後亦同意於十日，故即決定七月十日舉行。</p>
<p>成立全體小組會</p>
<p>美代表提議獲通過</p>
<p>旋美代表戴維斯提議將本委員　（即亞洲豐　　經濟　　）組成全體小組委員會，以便討論第七項所包括之各種問題。此提案當由菲代表附議。</p>
<p>史迭辛柯即聲稱：渠對該全體小組委員會之討論範圍及執行機　　方式，皆不能明瞭。主席當即答稱：美代表之提案，倘能通過，則該委員會即能開始討論蘇代表所提出之各項問題。沃文亦謂：本會之各項措施，及執行之方式，皆須由本委員會本身加以決定。</p>
<p>若干代表對在紐約舉行之全體委員會及在滬舉行之全體委員曾皆不能瞭解其區別者，一時分別發問。當由沃文建議：為便利分別二全體委員會計，權將紐約之委員會稱為「第一全體委員會」，在滬之全體委員會稱為「第二全體委員會」。</p>
<p>主席遂將美代表之提案付表決，當即全體通過，大會於四時散會。</p>
<h3>兩個全體委員會之區別</h3>
<p>所謂「第一全體委員會」者，乃經決定七月十日在成功湖舉行，討論亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會之會員，地區範圍，及變更或增加鐵事範圍等，其會議結果應向經濟社會理事會報告，該委員會之代表團，仍為現在出　會議之十國，代表可由各該國另行指派。主席人選則在召開會議時推選。</p>
<p>至第二全體委員會亦即全體小組委員會，將於州今晨十時半舉行，研討論經社理萬會決議案中第二部門第二節（內容已說明於前），其代表仍為亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會會議全體代表，其主要目的乃因小組委員曾可自由發表意見，而討論問題亦較廣泛，但在議程第七項應討論之各問題結束之後，全體小組委員會即復原為原有委員會會議。</p>

<h3>實施日臨時賠償計劃　盟總已擬定清單　美將提新計劃說我未接通知</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十八日電〕據最高方面消息：關於百分之三十臨時賠償計劃，盟軍總部之工作已準備就緒，刻正等待華盛頓遠東委員會之命令。盟軍總部經仔細研究之後，已擬定百分之三十臨時賠償之「合用物資淸單」，足以保證未曾參與初步賠償計劃之國家最後可不受影響。總部官員亟欲使賠償計劃，付諸實施，因其與日本國外貿易之恢復有密切關係。除非賠償問題至少自一部份獲得解決，則最近恢復日本國外貿易之努力實際上將屬徒然。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕報載美將有日本賠償新計劃提出，對日本未來工業又大見放寬，記者以此詢賠償委會負查人，承談：迄今爲止，我尚未接獲任何有關此消息之正式文件。又據可靠方面息：此案果眞提出，我必據理力爭。</p>
<h3>我賠償委會發表　日賠償物品數量</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十八日電〕我國五人賠償委員會，今日於其詳盡報告中，估計臨時賠償方案下賠償物品之總軍（其中包括裝箱重量）約為五百萬噸左右，此項報告之發表，旨在澄清我國內人士對於臨時賠償方案下，賠償物品總噸數所持之錯誤　念。我國五人陪償委會今日所發表之報告中，會引據日本商工省賠憤執行委會五月六日之聲明：「賠償物品總量約五百二十萬噸左右，運費估計為每噸一萬二千日元」。按日商工省所擬訂之最近賠償數字如下：（共有十三種工業）（一）兵工廠設備，净重一百廿二萬九千七百六十九噸，毛重一百六十六萬一百八十九噸，（二）飛機製造廠，淨重廿六萬六千二百十八噸，毛重五十一萬二千七百零四噸。（三）私有軍火工廠，净重廿萬七百零四噸，毛重廿八萬九百九十七噸。（四）機械工具工廠，淨重六萬六千六百二十三噸，毛重九萬三千二百七十三噸。（五）球軸承工廠，淨重二萬一千六百六十七噸，毛重三萬二百七十八噸。（六）電力工廠，淨重十七萬八千七百四十噸，毛重二十五萬四千五百九十二噸。（七）鋼鐵工廠，净重九十萬二百九十八噸，毛重一百十二萬五千三百七十一噸。（八）苛性蘇打工廠，淨重四萬三千零六十二頓，毛重五萬三千八百廿噸。（九）炭酸鈉工廠，淨重一萬五千七百噸，毛重一萬九千六百二十五噸。（十）硫酸工廠，淨重四萬一千三百九十四噸，毛重五萬一千七百五十五噸。（十一）人造橡膠工廠，淨重四千四百七十一噸，毛重五千三百六十五噸。（十二）私有造船廠，淨重十七萬四千五百零六噸，毛重廿一萬八千一百卅二噸，（十三）實騐室，淨重一千六百二十五噸。又人造　類，海軍造船等工業，並不在上述之列。</p>

<h3>菲華僑提備忘錄　要求將菲反華問題列入議程</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十八日電〕此間華僑商人，頃以備忘錄致上海之聯合國遠東經濟委員會，要求將蘇律賓之反華趨勢及年來之市塲聞題，列入議程。彼等認為遠東經委會應採適當途徑，勸導菲律賓各領袖，制止一般反華趨勢，並特別廢止公共市塲設攤法案。備忘錄中列有菲政府之各種顯為反對他國人民（事實上權為反華）之立法建議案，及行政措施，其中最可恨之一條，即為第三十七號之法案，該法案之基本目的，即在取消華僑旣得之合法職業。備忘錄復稱：菲律賓已組織反華同盟，其領袖為沙禿，該同盟之宗旨，欲將所有華僑逐出菲律賓。</p>
<p>〔又電〕菲律賓之反華情緒，又轉入一新頁，薩馬島之華僑一千餘人，俱於最近接獲署名為曼哥柴之警告信，令彼等停閉一切營業。曼氏自稱為反華退任軍人組織領導。此問華僑今日急派代表，向我駐菲領事館由訴此新組織之活動，並表示此種反華趨勢若不及時予以過止，則深恐將引起不良後果。</p>

<p>在全國人民祈求和平的呼籲聲中，我們旣曾看見有中共方面對參政會所作和平呼籲的拒絕，以參政會為政府的「御用機關」，對其代表民意所作的和平呼籲，加以否定、本報曩曾著論，有所評述：以為和平是人民一致的呼籲，同時，也是政府不變的方針。和平之所以未能實現，賞由於共黨的態度：並引美國合衆社記者自南京所發的電訊：「　中共最後之目的，乃一黨專權；而非多黨共同參加政權，此與世界各地之蘇雜埃政治形式相同，　經此情形之下，和平的獲致，就非易易，如今戰事在國內各地劇烈地展開着：在東北，在魯南，在津沽，在華北各地，甚至遠到西北的甘肅，和東南的閩粵，中共都以戰鬥的姿態，在展開它破壞統一·復興·建設的工作。在此情形之下，國軍自不能束手待斃，只有出以抵抗。所以在對日作戰勝利結束已近兩年的今日，全國各地還有戰鬥狀態的存在。直到今日，政府還在謀和，而中共的冀以武力擴展其勢力，步步進行，迄未稍停。這不是對和平呼籲的諷刺，更是什麽？不要看旁的，津沽原有美軍駐防，近自美軍分批撤離後，中共卽以武力，加以脅迫，以是律沽北平之間，睦路交通瀕於斷絕，嚴若戰禍之將重來。這局面是誰造成的？這不明明是中共造成的嗎？全國的人民，對於平津方面的局勢是關注的。他們明白津沽一帶之所以造成現在的局勢，完全由於中共想利用美國的撤兵而取得有利的地位，此在國軍，自不得不予以迎擊。由此例彼，可知國內戰事之所以正在進行，硬因為中共的迷信武力。</p>
<p>我們於此要指出的，就是：這決不是一種「丙戰」的局面。林肯總統時代出現在美國的「內戰」，決不是如此的；就是佛朗哥時代的西班牙「內戰」，情形亦復不同。說這是「內戰」，這就是侮辱了全國的人民；因為和平是全國人民的希望，政府亦始終不曾放案和平的意願。人民與政府都不願戰，而戰事之所以未能倖免者，實由於中共的迷信武力，冀圖顛覆現政府，而完遂其奪取政權的野心。這實在構成了「內亂」，政府是應該下令討伐，以張法紀的。然而說它是「內亂」，也還有問題。今日出現在國內的「亂」，已不是純粹的「內亂」，而實在是內外相勾結，具有一種國際性的「亂」了，今日在中共的武裝部隊內，有曾昔屬於日本「皇軍」的官兵，在東北且有北韓人民的武裝部隊與中共部隊協同作戰，這不已是明白的國際的戰亂了嗎？而正在這個時候，蘇蒙軍隊又入侵我國的新疆，與東北，華北各地的共黨軍事行動，遙相呼應，其為有計劊的作亂，動員了國際的力量，違反全國人民祈求和平的願望，不已昭然若揭？所以對於出現在我國中國的「內亂」，我們不得不辯明其本質。這是我們全國人民所必應有的一種認認。</p>
<p>中共旣然勾引了外力，公然作亂，是其行徑，與在精衛之流的漢奸羣又有什麽分別？全國人民有是非之辨，對於這些出賣民族利益者之所為，自有公論；我們無須在此多所指陳。不過我們於此有不能不指出的，却有下列的幾點：</p>
<p>第一，共黨在中國的所為，違背全國人民的意願，為全國人民所共棄。它又動員了國際的力量，使出現在中國的變亂，蒙了一層濃厚的國際色彩。我們深信我們的政府，必能善為處置這局勢。我們覺得遺憾的是當國內的局勢尚未趨於安定，秩序未復的時候，美國駐華的軍隊，旣已撤離，而蘇聯猶有重兵駐在我們的東北。如今對日的作戰旣已終止，我們希望蘇聯在我們束北的駐軍，亦能迅速撤離。</p>
<p>第二，出現在中國的動璗局勢，旣有其國際的意味，我們的隣邦便不能再以一種局外人的態度，彷彿置身事外；應該積極地更顯明地表示他們的態度。歐洲的局勢雖然可慮，但亞洲的局勢，尤為可慮。我們不應忘記第二次世界大戰不是發生在慕尼黑，而是發生在中國的瀋陽。杜魯門主義及馬歇爾的聲明應該包括亞洲在內，而且應該以亞洲，其核心。中國局勢的發展到現階段，其間國際關係占着一個重要的因素，我們不應該忽視這一點。</p>
<p>第三，我們在戰時有搞戰建國的呼號，現在抗戰勝利結束，雖有共黨的作亂，尤應積極展開我們復興建國的工作。破壞中求建設，動璗中求安定，這是我們戰時的呼號，也是現在的呼號。因此我們希望政府在戰亂之際，同時，亦能顧到建設。我國的民族經濟，經長期戰亂之後，百孔千瘡，此際縱非完全可以治本之時，亦應亟謀治療，冀圖逐漸康復。等到經濟情形，稍稍好轉，人民的情緒，亦必隨之增高。軍事，政治，經濟，此三者蓋不可分離。中共的作亂是全面的，我們亦必以全面的作戰來應付它們。</p>

<h3>英法已獲致協議　設歐洲經濟委會　並將邀請蘇聯參加工作　日後將在聯合國範圍內執行任務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播：英法兩國今日同意在聯合國經濟委員會範圍內，成立一歐洲經濟委員會，以便實施馬歇爾經濟援助歐洲之計劃。據法政府發言人聲稱：英法將聯合邀請蘇聯參加　委員　工作。按此次英法之協議，係由皮杜爾與貝文兩氏所促成，法內閣立即予以批准。又據法方　　云：此次歐洲委員會之成立，係根據法方之計劃，規定重建工作，交由專門委員會辦理，但一切工作均將在聯合國經委會範圍內進行。聯合國經濟委會，實際上乃一設計機構，而新委會則為執行機構。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十八日電〕法外長皮杜爾與英外相貝文今晨舉行第二次會議。英法談判終了後，皮杜爾將赴倫敦，批准英法條約，並就美國之經濟計劃，繼續討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十七日電〕法總理賴瑪迪·外長皮杜爾·英外相貝文曁雙方經濟題問今夜在英大使館之宴會　上，已從事第一步之接觸以資決定由歐洲響應馬歇爾援歐計劃之切實步驟。當貝文及其專家抵英使館後，即會同使館同僚，研究法外交部經濟司長亞爾芬所經供之備忘錄。該文件之內容，當與亞爾芬氏昨夜所宣布者同。共中要點，為建議設立四委員會，以研究歐洲關於煤斤·鋼鐵·運輸及農業四部份之需要及能力，貝文及賴瑪油等今夜之難題，乃為是否應即在較小範圍內立刻開始協商，抑將基於政治上之理由，避免作排除性的談判，以防被他人作為「西方經濟集團」。莫斯科方面固巴批評馬歇爾之計劃爲將偽裝下的杜魯門反共主義移植於經濟方面。在莫斯科尚未表示其正式意見以前，英法間之會談，自不能不予以格外審愼。在今明兩日之巴黎會談中，英法代表應就下列各問題之全部或一部，成立決議：（一）馬歇爾計劃下之泛歐經濟設計，將自限制性的西歐基礎開始以向東發展，抑將等待大多數歐州國家之表示同意，然後開會協商復興方針；（二）如決定採用前述之後一途徑，將如何召開會議並由何人起草議程；（三）若蘇聯拒絕參加馬歇爾計劃下之歐洲共同經濟設計，英法是否將繼績在歐洲其餘部份發動共同設計，如益，是否將使現在蘇聯勢力圈內之東歐國家參加；（四）馬歇爾計劃下之經濟設計如何可與德國之經濟設計合作，並將以何人代表德國參加設計機構。英美若干官員均覺此事雖期有迅速之進展，故觀察衆祗能隨時覺取指示而不可即時斯待其結果。但觀察家均信貝文與賴瑪迪目前至少應即決定歐洲共同經濟設計之討論，將以亞洲以西歐洲全部為基礎，抑將先自西歐開始，但保持門戶之開放，以待蘇聯及東歐國家隨後之參加。</p>
<h3>貝文訓令彼特遜　詢問蘇聯是否接受美援助計劃　蘇否認莫洛托夫訪法說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕英國外相貝文本日乘坐車機前往巴黎，行前數小時曾重新訓令英國駐蘇大使彼特遜爵士，命其詢問蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，蘇聯政府是否有意接受美國所提在經濟上援助歐洲之計劃。眞理報雖曾發表一文，表示反對美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥所提之歐洲經濟復興計劃，且聞此項計劃，在蘇聯官方人士之間，已引起不良之印象，但英國政府方面，並不承認此為蘇聯政府確切拒絕美國之建議。此外，貝文外相又訓令彼特遜大使，要求蘇聯政府說明匈牙利前任內閣總理那蘇之被排斥之事件。按英國政府前此要求蘇聯就此事提供情報，曾為蘇聯政府所拒絕云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社英斯科十七日電〕外傳蘇聯外長莫洛托夫將赴巴黎訪問，此間外交界人士聞訊之餘，一致表示詫異，並謂眞理報對於馬歇爾國務鄉之援助歐洲復興經濟一項計劃，業已加評論，表示絕對不贊成，故蘇聯派遣莫洛托夫外長前往巴黎討論此項計劃，自不可能云。</p>
<h3>法總統讚揚　馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十七日電〕法國歐禮和總統頃於本日向外報協會歡宴會發表演說，揄揚馬歇爾國務卿之歐洲復興計劃。略謂：目前買無猶豫之時間，法國政府對馬歇爾國務卿男敢而賢明之計劃，表示歡迎，此乃人生道上之一綫曙光，吾人需即勇往直前，不再有所稽延。法國對於國際經濟與政治合作，　表贊同，此非猶豫猜忌爭辯之時，吾人之古老大陸，實不應坐失此機會云。</p>
<h3>對美援歐計劃　蘇聯又一暗示</h3>
<p>主張由聯合國機構辦理</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕莫斯科昨夜之廣播表示蘇聯對於任何估計歐洲經濟需要之新嘗試，將不為蘇聯所鼓勵。該一廣播於重申眞理報前日批評馬歇爾援歐計劃之意見後，並稱此一計劃乃干涉他國經濟事務之計劃，認為當前任務不在收集關於各國經濟需要之情報，而在依據聯合國全體大會及經濟與社會理事會之決議，在國際合作之原則下，應付此等需要。莫斯科此一廣播，暗示若能經由聯合國之歐洲經濟委員會而不另設機構以執行馬歇爾之援歐計劃，可望較易爲蘇聯接受。此一暗示，對於貝文在巴黎進行之談判，或不無影響。</p>
<h3>挪瑞丹三國　將會商歐洲重建</h3>

<h3>世界銀行　決協助各國建設</h3>
<p>〔美國新開處華盛頓十七日電〕國際復與建設銀行借款部主任比尼奧本日告哥侖比亞商業促進曾稱：美國之繁榮胥賴世界經濟之健全。世界經濟之健全則可由國際銀行制定計劃，增進會員國間之互助關係，從事國內建設與開發事宜，藉以輔導之。比氏繼稱：該行現有借貸總額已達二十五億五千四百萬美元。凡申請借款者，該行將根據下項事實決定之：借款是否迫切及有用；借款對借方與世界貿易是否有所裨益；借方是否願意並能够運用共本身富源至最大程度；借款是否能符合借方　　；借方是否有能力維持借款之條件等。唯有在會員國提出運用計劃，並有適當之保證後，始可貸予借款。</p>
<h3>清理租借債務　美蘇談判擱淺</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕　關於美蘇兩國淸理租借債務之談判，頃據此間外交界人士談稱，因蘇聯方面在擬定租借物資之清單時，遭遇困難，故此項談判已為之躭擱。蘇聯不能將美國在戰時所給予之配備的詳單供給美國當局。</p>
<h3>義總統辭意打銷　義表示願支持馬卿計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日廣播：義大利共和國臨時總統尼古拉，昨以體力不勝為詞，表示倦勤之意，因總理加斯貝利之苦留，已決定打銷辭意。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十七日電〕裴總統尼古拉今日宣布其辭職之肯定決議，使義國政局大為騷動，茲悉各方面正力事挽留尼氏，良以目前並無任何法律上或議會的機稱，可以任命臨時總統也。尼古拉總統現年六十九歲，諒係由於神經疲勞，急需休息。渠前已宣布有於六月二十四日制憲議會原定解散之日辭職，最近制憲議會已改延至十一月三十一日解散，普選亦改明年新年舉行。尼古拉係於一九四六年六月廿八日經制憲議會以極大多數推選為總統。聞加斯貝利德理已向尼古拉總統表示，若因健康不佳，儘可請長假，但無論如何應請其繼續供職至制憲議會結束時為止。至於左翼黨派對於尼古拉總統之辭意堅決，則深自慶幸，彼等以為尼氏之辭職，或不在個人健康理由，或在對現政府缺乏信任也。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕義大使泰格里亞尼今日向美國務副卿克萊頓正式表示，義大利將全力支持馬歇爾國務卿宣布之援歐計劃。泰氏復告記者稱，「義大利當盡力與其他歐洲國家合作，響應馬卿之計劃，余已將此意告知克萊登」。</p>
<p>義共產黨　路綫轉向</p>
<p>〔合衆社馬馬十七日電〕義前任共產黨財政部長史柯瑪洛及該黨經濟專家多人，昨夜向義會發表演說，正式表示義大利之財政有賴於美國，並謂義大利急需外國借款，此唯美國所能予以接濟。義共潔今之態度擁護向美國借債，殆可視為脫離國際共黨路綫之行動，但史柯瑪洛所發表之演說，亦顯示義共黨與克里姆林宮之方針，有尖銳之紛歧。例如義共黨全力擁護特里埃斯特劃歸義大利，而克利姆林宮方面在國際會議中則主張以之割給南斯拉夫。</p>
<h3>匈銀行股權　一部移讓與蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔路透社匈京十七日電〕茲悉蘇聯已與匈當局成立協定，規定將匈牙利放款銀行內被認為德國國外資金根據波茨坦協定應歸蘇聯所有之股權讓與蘇聯。該銀行之大部份股權，戰前係屬法國之羅斯　爾特族所有，法國戰敗後，遂爲德國所得。根據蘇匈協定，該行百分之卅五之　　將　蘇聯，餘者在銀行私有　之問題獲得解決以前，將繼續由私人股東保持。同時匈財長及貿易部長在莫斯科進行聯國財政商務關　之談判，似已陷入僵局，匈財長定下週返國請示，公畢再返莫斯科。</p>
<h3>前總理那基表示　擬組匈流亡政府　防止歐局惡化盼美進一步行動</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕前匈牙利總理那基今日在此告美國報界稱，如果英美能承認匈牙利之流亡政府，渠即可準備組織此一政府，但渠表示此一政府或不致設在美國。那氏並曰，余有解決整個匈牙利局勢之計劃，但在與國務院官員接觸以前，尚不擬予以討論。余擬為我不幸人民之發言人，使世界得以知悉匈國及歐洲他國之眞相。那氏並斥匈京盟管會主席蘇聯史維里杜夫將軍所稱匈新政府已得人民同意之說爲無稽，並認蘇聯之拒絕美國之抗議，爲蘇維埃　敗路程上之又一記程碑。渠且認為防止歐洲局勢之更趨惡化起見，需要更甚於抗機之行動。詢以渠盼望英美採取何種行動？則曰，在與國務院會商以前，尚不擬就此點發表談話。那　明日將拜訪各要人，並至國務院晤馬歇爾，本週內可望由杜魯門總統接見。</p>
<p>匈國人民　喪失自由</p>
<p>〔法國新聞赴華盛頓十七日電〕匈前總理那基本日在此間向報界發表談話稱：蘇聯警察會利用「最不人道之方法」逼取匈人民所依法選舉之小地主黨議員之「口供」。匈牙利人民因蘇聯及共黨員之陰謀，已喪失其獨立，對於目下領袖之言行，已不復再負有責任。余對於此種侵略表示抗議，深望世界興論及各自由國家之政府，採取適當步驟，恢復匈人民及歐洲所有彼壓迫人民之自由。</p>
<p>〔聯合社匈京十七日電〕匈自由黨領袖蘇里奧克今日宣解：共黨昨日搗亂格特地方自由黨集會，證明匈牙利爲一警察國。余已取消預定一切政治演說，因不願再引起衝突之危險，除非本黨之集會自由獲得保障。同時共黨員稱，自由黨員成覺此種暴動或將展開內戰。</p>
<h3>英埃兩國修約爭端　埃向安理會申訴　總理將率領代表團親赴紐約</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅十七日電〕埃及商務部長黑亞斯今日宣稱：埃及政府業已於今日正式向安理會提出申訴，請聯合國機稱審查英埃關於一九三六年條約之爭端。埃總理諾克拉茜將親率代表團出席安理會，月底以前即可啓程飛紐約。埃政府之聲請，係由埃及駐美大使館提出，當今年一月英埃條約談判破裂時，埃總理會宣布向安理會申訴之目的，在要求全部英軍自埃撤退，蘇丹與埃及合併。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕外部發言人今夜稱：英駐安理會代表賈德幹爵士業已充分獲悉英埃糾紛中英國之立塲，英國繼續認此項立塲為合理，故埃及若主張一九三六年之條約因修約談判之失敗而失其效用，英國決予以駁正。英政府感覺聯合國機構應對下列事實，予以適當之老慮，即修約談判之破裂，係因英國自覺有保障蘇丹人民權利之責任，並非因埃及之要求英軍全部撤退。關於後一點，倫敦固已同意云。</p>
<h3>貝特柯夫被捕事　保總理聲明</h3>
<p>和約義務決予履行</p>
<p>〔路透社索菲亞十七日電〕保總理狄米特洛夫為美國指麗保政府之逮捕反對黨領袖貝特柯夫，特於今日發表談話，請外國旁觀者在被控陰謀武力政變之貝特柯夫審結以前，忍耐毋噪。狄氏謂，渠業已向美國釋明逮捕貝氏法律上的理由，並曰若千短視之人以為貝氏被捕之後，將發生動亂及反抗祖國陣綫之暴動，此等現象並未發生。現今全國安謐，蓋數月以來具有思想之保人，對於貝特柯夫及其黨羽不利於人民之行動，均已洞悉，故對貝特柯夫之被捕，朱有一人表示抗議者。迄至目前為止，政府所接獲為貝特柯夫辯護之函僅有兩件。狄氏繼謂，保國力圖本於雅爾達協定之精神而行事，並履行停戰協定及和平條約，根據此項義務，保國不但應保障人民之基本自由，並應解散法西斯團體及從事反對聯合國宣傳之機構。政府對於企圖復活法西斯主義，甚至準備以武力奪取政權之人，自不能給予自由云。</p>
<h3>日與德勾結　會謀刺史達林　美在德境搜獲文件</h3>

<h3>杜魯門倖獲勝利　衆院支持否決减稅法案　相差僅二票杜氏自稱係出意外</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕衆議院今日以兩票之差支特杜魯門總統對削减所得稅四十僮美元法案之否決。减稅間題四須延至一九四八年總統競選時決定之。共和黨衆議院議長馬丁稱，「吾人或須等待共和黨總統出世，然後實行此事。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕杜魯門總統十七日自普林斯頓大學返抵華府，對於衆議院擁護總統否決减徵所得稅法案之表決，殊爲欣慰。但杜氏又須迅速決定政治上同樣重要之塔虎脫，哈德萊之管制勞工法案。杜魯門在返程中發表渠對於衆院表決之意見稱：「此舉較余預期者為佳，余甚感荷衆議院擁護余之否決。」記者問以總統是否擬否決塔虎脫。哈德萊法案，渠稱：「余不知應否予以否決，余對此尚無決定。」</p>

<p>今各國均認主要之問題乃爲決不允日本再成侵略者，麥帥今認爲已使日人發生精神草命，然注意日本事務者，對精神革命之程度，尙表懷疑。如各國均接受麥帥之意見，則對日和約之條件，自必　爲寬大又日本之領土，殆已必僅限於本土四島，其武裝旣已解除，而資源又不足以供發動戰爭之用；然美國在遠東方面，尙對蘇聯懷有戒心，此項戒心，已使若干盟國人士，支持外傳日本外交部所要求之強力警力及少數空軍。日本已無望收回千島，庫頁，或冲繩，故提議於和約生效後，自此等基地以空軍控制日本者已頗不乏人。</p>
<h3>日議會如期開會</h3>

<h3>移植心贜　蘇醫師試騐成功</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十七日電〕年甫三十之蘇醫學專家特米柯夫，告眞理報稱，渠試騐將一狗之心臟及腩臟，移植於另一狗，以及將心臟一具與另一狗之心臟連接一處，已獲成功。但各狗於經手術後，未有繼續生存在八天以上者。此項試騐甚為重要，蓋人類於施行胸部手術時，殆亦可使用移植手術以使其生存。特氏以人造心臟移植動物體作試騐時，被移植之動物於數小時後即死亡。特氏認致死原因，不在該一人造心臟之動作不靈，而在血液與該一人造心臟之壁接觸時凝結所致。渠認若以防止凝結之物製造人造心臟，同時並在血液中注射防凝體，即可使人造心臟完成其任務。</p>
<h3>日積極復興漁業　麥師批准龐大造船計劃　總噸數將超過戰前甚钜</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十八日電〕麥帥總部為積極扶殖日本之漁業計，近批准一龐大之日產業界漁船建造計劃。現據該計畫，日本得建造鋼鐵鮪魚船二百六十八艘，大型未鮪船十七艘，總噸數為三萬五千三百噸。鋼鐵撈網船四百四十二艘，總噸數計四萬另九百噸。此計劃實行結果，日本於一九四九年末可造成一十噸以上之鮪魚船一百二十艘，總噸數為七萬二千八百噸，水獺撈網船五十九艘，另一稱撈網船九百三十三艘。噸數之總和將超過戰前以上。並於本年末將組織三大漁船隊，從事捕魚活動。中國海亦指定十分之四為日本漁塲。據麥帥總部天然資源局漁業課負責人談稱：日本漁船於戰爭中大受損失，一九三九年二十噸以上之鮪魚船約八百六十艘，計五萬三千六百噸，而一九四六年减少至三百四十艘，計二萬一千六百噸。一九三九年四十五噸以上之水　撈綱船六十七艘，去年减少至十六艘，另一種撈網船六十八艘，去年减少至三十八艘，故如不批准此造船計劃，日本將不能維持其最小限度之漁業云。</p>

<h3>宣司令談話</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕淞滬警備司令宣議吾，昨日下午接見各報社記者，就詢問點答覆如下：經濟偵察團自本年二月間奉命成立後，對於安定金融，已獲相當成效，惟此種緊急措施，原屬權宜辦法，且警備部近以全力注意治安，實已無暇兼顧，故於日前電呈主席請予結束，業軍主席批准，於十八日起正式結束。嗣後關於違反經濟法令事件，由市政府辦理。至南京路實　錢莊被詐欺一事調查後尚無報告。</p>
<h3>勞資雙方　應相諒解</h3>
<p>宣氏探討目前經濟問題，應從根本上求解決，根本之辦法，在於社會羣衆應即有組織，產生力量，和政府合作聯繫，物價自可平穩，物價平穩，低待遇，低工資，亦可過舒適生活。現在一般人却捨太逐末，以為物價漲，只要待遇高，工資增，便可解決生活，要知待遇與工資增加，物價亦必加倍高漲，如此循環，將走上經濟崩潰之路，故勞資之間，如能互相諒解協調，工潮可以避免。</p>
<h3>被捕學生近況</h3>
<p>一般關心目前因有共黨陰謀份子嫌疑而被捕之學生與記者之處置及近况，宣氏答記者詢問稱：被捕學生，未受任何痛苦，現使與學校暫時隔離，在此一時間內，常有專家對彼等所幻想之問題，作共同的研討，並使彼等對當前政治問題有更進一步的認識，以避免淺薄幼稚的言論與行動，故與其說係予懲罰，不如說係予敎育爲得當。彼捕記者之情形，大致相同。</p>

<h3>全市絲只業　怠工三小時</h3>

<h3>三局長請聯總行總　撥助防疫器材藥物</h3>

<h3>陸續撈獲浮屍百數十具　達豐遇難客總數難統計　打撈掩埋繼續進行　家屬會商善後辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市普善山莊，為料理達豐輸遇難旅客打撈掩埋等着後事宜，昨又派汽車三輛，載家屬四十餘人，會同輸船公司職員四人，駛往實山縣獅子嶺及太倉瀏河一帶江邊。在獅子嶺海灘方面，又撈獲浮屍二具，當由普善山莊收殮，但不釘棺蓋，俾便家屬辦認。</p>
<p>掘出屍體　認明二具</p>
<p>同時又曾同實山縣警察局，將日前附近居民所埋屍體三十餘具，一一掘出，供家屬辨認，所有屍體，因受水浸，復受土掩，已腐爛不堪，甚至手足支離，又有一部份屍體，在撈獲時，衣飾已為大水衝去，故三十餘具屍體中，僅有二具由死者家屬認明領去，一具係張新亮，男，卅五歲，另一具雖亦由其家屬領去，但公司當局未有紀錄，故姓氏不詳。</p>
<p>派潛水伕　入輪搜索</p>
<p>至太倉方面打撈人員，迄晚尚未回滬，詳情不悉，總計自達營失事至今，在寶山·太倉·　河等各處所撈獲之屍首已在一百二十具以上，且連日仍陸續有新屍體發現，故達豐輸中遇難旅客總數，一時尚無法統計。輸船公司定今晨九時，派申華輪載潛水伕至達豐輪失事處海面，由潛水伕潛入沉沒海底之達豐輪搜索屍體。</p>
<p>先行磋商　暫不訴訟</p>
<p>死難旅客家屬，昨在北海路南通旅滬同鄉會開會，商討處理善後辦法，除登報通告沿江各港口，請注意遇救旅客外，仍要求公司繼續打撈展體，對已證實遇難或失蹤旅客之家屬，應由輪船公司發給撫恤金，同時請航政當局取締各遠齡船隻，或救生設備不佳之航輪，以保今後旅客安全。家屬方面為諒解輪船公司起見，暫不進行訴訟，先行直接磋商，冀能獲致合理解決。</p>
<p>輪局表示　不可抗力</p>
<p>據達豐輪船局方面表示，此次失事原因，全係人力所不能抗拒之　　，且本月九日夜間，狂風暴雨中，除達豐輪遭遇沉失外，其他帆船漁船被傾覆者，在百艘以上，故連日所發現之百餘具浮屍，決非全爲達　輪旅客，但苦屍體腐爛，不能辦認耳。至於善後問題，俟屍體處理完竣後，再行磋商。</p>
<h3>嚴監使出巡返滬　談各地秩序安謐</h3>
<p>江蘇監察使嚴莊過前出巡蘇錫常三縣，於十七日晚返滬。嚴氏十八日接見記者稱：所至各地均有人民陳訴，雷一一詳予調查處理。目前各地秩序尚稱安謐，復員工作亦有進展，徵兵徵糧人民雖不無苦痛，但其辦理情形，較之過去顯有進步，地方政治亦尚少瑕疵。嚴氏對駐紮吳江同里之軍官總隊，姦死女教員鄒月娥，表示憤慨，渠謂該隊隊員二千人，散居民家，烟賭嫖時有發生，國防部亟須妥為處置。現監察使　對此姦殺事件，業已派員澈查，渠又指出常州最近破獲之私　軍火供給蘇北共黨事件，此事發生已有半年以上，民間早有傳聞，但至最近始獲破案，可見決非普通商民所為，殊堪注意云。</p>
<h3>後方來滬失業工人　將代安插或予遣歸　李劍華由京返滬後談</h3>

<h3>轟助全國糧貸案　八被告判決免訴　適合大赦令規定應予赦免</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動全國歷時年餘之糧貸案，昨展在地院宣判。刑庭長吳業呱，偕推事黃光鈺，梅爾和（代），書記　　，升座刑二庭後，提在押之被會汪運人，王巽之，莊漢章，吳蓉生等四人，在保被告任星崖，萬　林，邢志剛，楊　畬籌四人均未到庭。吳庭長起立宣　判決書主文：「王　之，莊漢章，吳蓉生，萬墨林，邢志　，楊潤畚，　達人，任星崖均免訴。」吳庭長坐下　，略述判決理由從，即諭知在押　告，暫仍還押，候本判決確定後，　　開釋。彼告律師以被告等羈押迄今已　，今旣已免訴，請求准予交保，　　以書狀聲請，聽候或定。茲將該　判決　理由附後：</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>獲犯罪在民國卅五　十二月卅一日以前，其最重本刑為有期徒刑以下之刑者均赦免之，又曾經大赦者，應諭知免訴之判決。國民政府卅六年一月一日大赦令甲項及刑爭訴訟法第二百九十四條第三款有明文規定，本件被告王巽之，係長江公司副總經理，莊漢章係其營業主任，被告萬墨林係萬昌米行經理，去年四月間中央政府應上海市政府商會臨時參議會及地方各界之要求，着糧食部上海糧政特派員辦公處</p>
<p>舉辦糧貸</p>
<p>，貸與該公司米行各法幣六十萬元。被告等乘糧價高漲之際，將貸款購得之米，隱匿不售，或自賣自買，意圖操縱。被告吳萍生係三泰米行經理，將政府抑平糧價而委托拋售之米，轉　不售，其對於米糧，均有投機壟斷操縱之行為，又被告汪達人，係上海糧　處代理特派員，任星崖係調節科長，均負糧政之重任，增厚滬市存糧及平抑糧價為其應盡之職責。換言之，即有防止糧價高漲之義務，但被告等事前既無周詳之策，事後又乏救急之方，</p>
<p>因循坐誤</p>
<p>致短促之一月中，糧價自每石二萬數千元，飛漲至五六萬元，羣情惶惑，物議沸騰，猶於去年五月一日，藉口市塲混亂，佈告停售貸米，其有帮助投機壟斷操縱之行為，情節顯然。旋經監察院江蘇監察使提出糾舉，將刑事部份移送本院檢察官偵查明確，對被告主巽之·莊漢章·吳蓉生·萬墨林，以非常時期農礦工商管理條例第三十一條，對被告汪達人·任星崖依同條例第三十一條，刑法第十五條第三十條，第一百卅四條</p>
<p>提起公訴</p>
<p>。按「指定之企業及物品其生產者或經營者不得有投機壟斷或其他操縱之行為，」非常時期農礦工商管理條例第十二條有明文規定，又「違反第十二條之規定而有投機壟斷或其他操縱行為者，處五年以下有期徒刑，並科所得利益一倍至三倍之罰金」，同條例第三十一條亦定有明文。查此項犯罪，係最重本刑有期徒刑以下之罪，被告等犯罪之時期，又在民國卅五年十二月卅一日以前，本可及時赦免，但刑事訴訟以發現</p>
<p>眞實爲主</p>
<p>而刑事訴訟法第二百四十六條復有「檢察官就犯罪事實一部起訴者其效力及於全部之規定，本案有關民食，自舉辦糧貸之後，糧價忽行暴漲，其中有無互相勾結圖利之貪汚情形，本院認為有牽連關係，故不厭求詳，併予調查，是被告汪達人等能否赦免，又應以有無圖利貪汚之情事為斷。本院迭經嚴訊被告汪達人·任星崖，旣均否認有收受各糧商審查費，介紹費·黑市利息及賄峪等情，亦無與糧商分潤之約定，而到案之糧商朱永明·顧益生·傳昌裕·馮鏞聲·俞良濟·張超·徐泰元·祝世祿·汪玉振·陸麟勳·邢頌文·邵季高，經</p>
<p>隔別詢問</p>
<p>復一到具結證明對糧政處人員從未繳付審杳費·介紹費·黑市利息，亦未交付賄賂及任何不法利益。至證人徐寄廎到庭又稱：「不致有收取審查費·介紹費之事，糧政人員亦無與糧商勾結情事」，經訊以「在糧貸方面，有無聽到除官利之外還　黑利」，則謂「沒有聽到」證人奚王書到庭亦稱「糧貸係政府找　商，　商何必勾結糧政人員，糧價之漲，因產米區聞上海舉辦糧貸，紛紛抬價，而主要原因實為迪化膨脹」，經訊以「　政處人員有無拿錢之事」，則答「沒有」，又詰以「貨款除官利三分之外有　黑利」，復種「決　黑利之事」各等　。查徐寄　係上海市　會董事長，又爲當時民　機關上海市臨時參議會議長，日經　結，其證言</p>
<p>自可置信</p>
<p>而奚天書又係該臨時參議　　議長，亦經具結，且與被告等均無恩怨，其證言亦堪採用。再查核本院檢察官及淞滬警備司令部偵查之卷宗以及各項賬册表格，迄未發現被告汪達人等互相勾結圖利之證據，依刑事訴訟法第二百六十八條「犯罪事實應依證據認定」之規定，被告汪達人等貪污圖利之事實，旣屬無從認定，因而檢察官起訴書所引用之法條，不能不認為正當，則被告王巽之·莊漢章·吳蓉生·萬墨林·注達人·任星崖，雖有投機壟斷操縱或帮助投機壟斷操縱之行為而構成非常時期農礦工商管理條例第三十一條之罪，因逢國家大赦之恩典，合於國民政府卅六年一月一日大赦令　項規定，</p>
<p>倖邀赦免</p>
<p>除被告汪達人·任星崖是否失職部份，不屋司法範圍，另由其主管機關自行核辦外，應將被告王巽之·莊漢章·吳蓉生·萬墨林·汪達人·任星崖諭知免訴之判決」。不被告楊潤　·邢志　·私將貸款授讓，檢察官依刑法第三百三十九條第二項提起公訴，縱令成立犯罪，因其最重本刑為五年以下有期徒刑之罪，而其犯　時期，又在民國卅五年十二月卅一日以前，亦合於大救令甲項規定，自在赦免之列，　應　知免訴。據上論結，應依刑事訴訟法第二百九十四條第三款國民政府大赦令甲項判決如主文。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕德僑產業淸理處一年來淸理德僑產業，迄今業已告一段落。據該處負責人約略統計，淸理以來標售收入計德孚顏料二百五十億元，拜耳藥品七十二億元，其餘零星物品傢具約二十億元，共爲三百四十餘億元。所有德僑產業除尚存一小都份德孚顏料及拜耳藥品外，其餘禮和·西門子·美最時·孔士·魯麟等各德商洋行之少量存貨財產，均已淸理完竣。至於顏料及藥品現存之數量雖僅剩接收時之小半，但因物價上漲，佔計現值顏料約一千二百億，藥品約三百餘億。此項顏料藥品存貨因本年初政府有成立國營工廠之計劃，故迄未標售，後因經濟政策變更，小工業以多予民營為原則，故未成立國營機構。但售與民營技術上亦有困難而未果，最近政府又宣佈以此項顏料藥品存貨充作美金公債之抵押，但詳細辦法尚未決定。現該處之工作爲處理零星德僑產權之發還等事項，以待政府決定後成立新機請。</p>

<h3>叢林中的文化幼芽　廬山圖書館</h3>
<p>— 本報南昌記者　劉藻十二日寄</p>
<p>廬山圖書館，是牯嶺百草叢林中一枝文化幼芽。它在十四年前的暑天，創議興修，到民國廿四年七月館址落成，在創設的過程中，蔣主席曾經督工考察，館址的選定，就是主席親自所擇。原來一家蓬屋的老頭子，現在還能詳述當時選擇館址的經過。</p>
<p>曾任孤軍營房</p>
<p>它在過去的歲月中，不幸遭遇八年有奇的戰火洗劫，作過廬山孤軍的營房，亦曾被日軍利用作爲軍火倉庫。自從廿八年四月十八日與牯嶺同時淪陷，到卅四年十月廿九日始慶光復。現在依然挺秀在牯牛嶺下，成爲廬山的一個新興事業。</p>
<p>去夏，蔣主席蒞臨牯嶺，手令行政院補助該館事業費二千萬元。贛省府核定該項事業費的支配，以九百萬元爲新書購置費，六百萬元缺本抄補費，五百萬元爲各項設備費，該館獲得此款補助後，去冬即開始整理，現在依　在進行圖書分類編目工作。</p>
<p>戰後增加善本</p>
<p>廬山圖書館的藏書，在戰前因爲成立時間短促，藏書的數目，現在沒有目錄及案卷查考。戰後接收，倒增加了不少善本，因爲各地的藏書，被日軍劫奪，輾轉來到山上。據接收時的報告，有中文存書五三·三二一册，西文書八·八六四册，合計爲六二·一八五册。在這些存書中，西文書八·八六四册專室存放外，中文書五三·三二一册，有三分之二是綫裝古書，三分之一是普通裝近代圖書，現亦分室存放。</p>
<p>需要抄寫人才</p>
<p>中文古書中，有將近萬册的善本，其中缺殘須抄補者，約有一百廿册，須要裝釘修補者，約有千册。他們現在正須要善於抄寫與修補的專門人才。這些綫裝古書中，屬於史集二部者較多，屬於經子二部者較少，　書類者僅有十餘部，誌書類者僅包括三五省，及其所屬各縣的省縣誌書。</p>
<p>普通圖書，多係民國廿六年以前的出版，其中什九是商務印書館所刊行者，總數爲二萬一千餘册。但複本殊多，剔除複本後，正本不過八千餘册。茲本參考書，更是缺少。</p>
<p>今夏正式開放</p>
<p>現在他們正準備今夏正式開放，一切準備工作，大半均已完成。並將在蓮花洞，牯嶺市街，舉辦街市閱覽部，文化公寓，用以招待名人學者，取費低廉。並擬舉辦學術講習會，及學術講座云。</p>

<h3>業餘資格問題　將有熱烈討論　國際奧林比克小組提出報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社斯德哥爾摩十七日電〕國際奧林匹克委員會現在此間開會，原擬立即決定一九五二年奧林匹克大會會址問題，因申請之城市過多，大會不得不變更議事程序。委員會主席艾斯特隆稱：因申請願意主辦之城市太多，故不得不變更計劃，以便研討各城市所携來之運動塲模型，影片及計劃等等。會址之擇定大約將於本星期六委員會開會前宣布。提出申請之亞姆斯特丹，第德律，洛杉磯，明那波利斯，費拉特爾非亞，芝加哥，及芬蘭京城海爾辛蘭七個城市代表團，均將陳述意見。艾氏又稱：明年在倫敦舉行之世界運動大會，籌備進行順利，不致流產。外傳種種，均屬無稽。國際亞林匹克委員會副主席美國代表勃隆達奇已視察各種籌備情形，表示滿意。英國籌備委員會主席蒲萊稱：各輪船公司明年將有更多之輪船開班，並有多數船隻用作水上旅館，以解決住宿問題。同時，定義小組對「業餘運動家」一名詞之定義，經一年之辯論後，向大會提出報告，已由委員會發還討論。艾斯特隆稱：「業餘運動家之定義，各方意見頗難一致，但吾人希望成立一適當法典，供一九四八年倫敦奧林匹克大會採用」。</p>
<p>業餘選手定義</p>
<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩十七日電〕「業餘資格」小組委員會今日提出之報告，如爲在此間開會之國際奧林比克委員會所接受，則在明年奧林比克世運會中，業餘運動選手可獲得薪工損失之補償，而不觸犯業餘規則。小組委員會提出之報告，關於「業餘運動員」之定義如下：「一業餘運動員，爲對於體育運動比賽，除視爲運動遊戲之外，無論直接或間接，並不有任何物質上之進益收獲」。體育界方面稱：參加運動比賽後之薪工損失補償，並非爲進益收獲，而僅爲一種損失之避免。但最後之解釋，將由各國體育協會自行決定云。</p>

<h3>產量今年可增三四倍　茶商希望政府收購　依照現價可換美匯兩百萬元</h3>
<p>各地茶葉登塲，已成尾聲，而收購工作，並不如其他出口貨物之積極推動，茲據茶葉業領袖稱，去年茶葉產量共約八萬担，今年以各地茶　對除草施肥，早有佈置，其綜產量可增加三四倍，估計總額可達三十萬担。但茶商鑒於原訂茶貸，其尺度距事實需要太遠，致興趣減遞。按茶貸原則，須由茶商先行　款收買毛茶，然後再申請貸款。茶商則基於去年度陳茶鋼路呆滯，資金　損甚巨，在　貨未脫手前，新茶實無決大量進行收購。目前已製成之外銷箱茶，祇祁紅一種，計二萬五千箱，合一萬兩千市担。其餘如屯綠可產三萬五千餘担，平綠七萬餘担，均受資金限制，無法進展。如此項問題能獲解決，則外銷紅綠茶總數當不難達十萬箱以上。現雖値茶葉旺季已過，然急起直追，仍可挽回。其方法當不外政府速頒收購方針，對委託茶商代製毛茶一點。其意見認爲最合理者，莫如依照米價折算。並稱：茶葉爲吾國出口主要貨品，若以十萬担箱茶估計，依照目前海外價格比例，約可換反兩百萬美元；以充裕國軍。更可維持國際市塲，不致被他國茶葉侵奪。此外如產區茶農受惠，農村經濟活潑，對於社會治安問題，亦可得相當　助云。</p>
<h3>永紗連續抬後　臨收趨勢已轉疲</h3>
<p>華股昨通續拉抬之後，業中大戶力竭聲嘶，後勁不繼，每逢永紗蠢動之時，小型股反每况愈下，破綻旣無力彌補，加上紡建將於今日解繳巨額結款，以及遞交證金改採累進制等訊頻傳，臨收終於轉怯，趨勢已見不利。</p>
<p>晨初以改革經濟方案訊而稍堅，　永紗開高後，並有五四號一八五號二二三號購納，九四號一四八號一五四號買進現永紗，而將遞永紗拉高至七九〇〇元外。二一八號五〇號脫售現永紗，一九號二三四號一五五號一五四號賣到七七九〇元。八九號七八號一四二號三二號尙納，二一九號七六號並進現永紗，升爲七九〇〇元。一五四號一八六號一六二號一二九號賣到七七七〇元。七六號三二號一四八號二二四號二二三號一五五號來進，二一九號一五二號再進現永紗，乃漲到七儿七〇元，即交永紗亦升至七六〇〇元高價。一〇八號二三四號一四號二〇〇號賣出，八三號並賣現永紗，聯華地產雖再由一六二號掛高至漲停，仍迫降至七七五〇元。商務由一七號等提高至限度，二四號四八號九七號再進至七九〇〇元。即因傳聞紡建將繳　一千二百億巨額結款，六〇號一五七號二三五號一〇二號一六三號一五三號了結之下，十一時半，遞永紗跌至七六二〇元。惟午刻因一五七號三五號二三一號力納，加上一〇四號六一號並購現永紗，最後一次蠢動，將遞永紗拉上至七八五〇元後，三號力售現遞永紗，一一二號二二三號一一九號六一號一〇〇號等均售，臨收遞永紗跌至七五一〇元。現永紗七一八〇元。塲內紛傳　交存帳如逾三十億者，其證金改採累進制，又謂經紀人公會代表將於晚間赴京磋商。午收稍定，收後一〇〇號八號等再賣，喊價低至七四七〇元。結果與前收相咬，計即交永紗新光景福動興信和美亞新華微挫，中法華豐各降半成，永公獨稍見升，商務漲停後有回，軋好半成，聯華漲達限度，內衣大通中紡微升，景倫升一成弱，國貨好半成，火柴五和統益微降，水泥新亞跌半成，麗安跌一成，中絲榮豐平平。遞交各股計永紗新光永公稍漲，信和美亞華　勤與景福小挫。塲外各老股疲者居多。</p>
<p>掉期交易，昨套利合息一角三迄一角七不等，大部份在一角半左右。永紗由二二〇號四五號一一〇號五六號七四號一〇六號以及一七七號貼進，自三八〇元開後退爲三二〇元八五號一〇二號一一七號二三五號貼出，最後站定於三五〇元左右。華豐五元至五元半，新光六元半至八元半，信和自一二〇元至一四五元不等　本月二十日銀行休假，證交亦停市一天。</p>
<h3>統債平陷　外股頹唐</h3>
<p>公債昨平和逾恒，僅統戊略見秀色，起仆範圍有限。統丙晨開七千三，低價七千二，高價七千七，最後在七千四左右盤旋。五五五室五〇三室三六〇室均進，五五二室六〇四室二三〇室均售，結果與前收相較計甲乙丁均平，統丙微升一百元，統戊亦漲三百元，成交約五六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨見頗廢，小股若航業鋼業更爲不支。怡紗晨開六九六〇〇元，交易有限，散戶出入不一，證券帮有供，步降至六五〇〇〇元低價，而後稱定。港申電徽升至十四元半左右，結果較前收計航業鋼業各跌一成强，英聯業廣各挫一成不到，怡紗會德豐紙業怡啤各降半成左右。</p>
<h3>食米人心堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米五千二百餘石，內地轉俏，人心堅挺。兩市塲粳秈米均見挺升三五千元，惟收盤去化仍懈，形勢欲漲無力。粉價較低，影響米市，亦不無關係。</p>
<p>麫粉因廠方大量供應，配粉繼續，市勢平正。麩皮鄕消活靈，步升一二千元，豆餅實銷甚殷，續漲三四千元。油市東北來貨見减，客心堅固，飛騰四五六萬元不一，店方納胃加强，黄豆依然牢立，菉豆趨勢暫平，赤豆仍無變化。</p>
<p>紅糧冒呆少神，回低二三千元，苞米去化不爽，下挫三四千元。生仁滬南進胃轉　，挫落五六千元，芝蔴仍居挺秀，高而愈固。蠶豆來貨湧吒，市化呆滯，節節下降，再削三五千元。小麥暫定之狀。</p>
<h3>洋米到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海辰輪，自仰光返滬，昨下午達到，運來小絞米七千噸（約七萬包），停泊十一。十二號浮筒起卸過駁。</p>
<p>又大英公司澳杜號，由孟買運來棉花九千九百餘件，前日傍晚抵埠，現泊公和祥碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>棉花趨勢高翔</h3>
<p>昨日棉花市况，因棉紗繼續上漲，人心愈堅，後市一致看高。紗廠以成品售出，亟須補進原料，故納胃甚大，客帮羣起添辦，同業互相扒吸，市上買氣極濃，但執貨者勢成靜觀，不肯輕脫，交易成爭購之象。高檔棉成交數量不大，普通貨成交比上日稍遜，午後做開送廠價計靈寳一五九萬五千，一六二萬，一六三萬至一六五萬。沙市一四四萬，一四九萬至一五〇萬，通州一四〇萬，漢口細絨一二〇萬。又棧交價做開計靈寳一五五萬。一六七萬，通州一二五萬至一二七萬五千。漢口細絨一一四萬一二〇萬至一三三萬，一四三萬。夾粗漢細一一七萬，老河口一三三萬，冲沙市一三八萬，火機一一二萬，周浦籽花每組一九萬二千至二一萬二千。（註）漢口細絨最低價與最高價相差甚大，原因由於細絨內粗絨摻夾太多，潮濕過重，不合標準，依照棉業普通成交各檔花衣，大都以粗細對夾爲普通，如細絨內僅一二成摻夾者，即爲上檔貨，故價格較高云。</p>
<h3>絲綢價均平穩</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲堅穩，與上日相仿。一二〇號高山有光，以一千九百七十五萬元開盤，終因實銷甚淡，價乃低回，中午收盤爲一千九百六十萬元，下午又軋小十萬元，九百五十萬元有成交。東洋牌子下午做九百六十五萬元，係包子無木箱貨，七五號金鷄半光並無成交，喊價未動。</p>
<p>廠經昨市亦然堅定C字等級有正式交易，新貨價做二千五百萬元，陳貨價做二千四百二三十萬元，均有七天期頭。D字等級新貨喊價四百五十萬元，其他各級喊價，亦與上日相同，新貨另担，昨成交價二千二百五十萬至三百五十萬元幾檔，千經依然銷滯，喊價未見更動。　昨市綢貨續見俏俐，大誠被面喊價九百四十萬元，華强被面九百二十萬元有成交，比上日漲起十萬元之譜。大誠格子璧縐開市做三萬四千六七百元，後因貿興甚濃，價遂向上，最後收市爲五千元，即期價。隔日期做五千二百元，比上日大五百元。人造絲貨華錦縐昨高檔貨一萬八千元有成交，盛貨冲電力紡上身貨做價二十七萬五千元，羅紡因乏去胃，市價站定。</p>
<h3>紗市欣欣向榮</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，雖逢紡建公司開紗，市氣仍頗挺秀。蓋因本街染織廠等需求頻繁，客路漢口帮搜吸殷勤，兼業外游資參與活動，是以二十支紗再創高峰，結果特雙馬價爲九百四十萬，雙馬紗八百四十七萬元，比上日步漲三五十萬元，四二支藍鳳紗亦升七十五萬元之鉅，三十二支及二十支十六支等紗價，均跳上三十萬至七八十萬元不一。</p>
<h3>紗布繼漲增高</h3>
<p>棉布市况，因紡建公司遽爾减少配額，引起各方揣測，塲中散戶及北帮新買，互相競進，盤面籌碼枯竭，喊價步步上升，最後十二磅各檔細布，比上日繼漲一萬五六千至二萬餘元，深色藍布元布及士林布等亦高二三四萬元，其他細斜嗶嘰府綢等市，亦頗挺俏。</p>
<h3>羢綫廠拋售　七月份期貨</h3>
<p>本市中國毛羢廠出品皇后牌細羢綫，於前日拋售七月份期貨數萬磅，廠盤每磅開價二十萬元。又安樂廠之細英雄，及上海毛羢廠之雙貓粗羢，裕民廠之雙羊粗羢等，均於昨日拋售七月份期貨。廠盤計細英雄每磅十八萬元。雙貓粗羢十四萬七千五，　羊粗羢九萬六千五百元。</p>
<h3>推展紡綢會會務　委員今開談話會　定本月廿一日正式成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業調節委員會已定於本月廿一日上午十時，在本市圓明園路廿四號該會會址正式成立，並同時舉行該會第一次全體委員會議。該會主委鄒秉文已去電經濟部，請陳部畏屆時親臨參加主持。</p>

<p>原有紡管會經辦之南運北運審核發證等業務，仍將繼績辦理。聞紡管曾刻正靜候經部指令頒到，俾便結束會務，並決定該項業務移轉於紡調會之辦法云。</p>
<p>又訊：第六區棉紡公會貢獻紡調會施政方針意見四點，業誌昨一日本報。記者昨特微詢紡調會主委鄒秉文氏意見。沃吿：對六區公會貢戲意見，甚表歡迎，可提供會中參考。渠稱：紡調會爲委員制，包括國民營紗廠委員，故各界貢獻意見，均將提交會中集體討論決定。會中不能決定者，尙能請示經濟部。故對所貿戲意見，均將提付鄭重商討採納，渠個人並無意見云。</p>
<h3>團體分紅儲蓄辦法　一俟政院通過即可實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕團體分紅儲蒂辦法，即將實行。此案業經四聯理事會通過，交由中國交通中農中信郵匯五行局會同辦理，財部方面，認爲該案可以實行，惟不必由五行局洽辦，僅由中信局辦理即可。聞該案已送政院，一俟通過，即可實行。按團體分紅儲蓄辦法，係分甲乙兩種，甲種規定每一萬戶爲一個團體，每戶儲十萬元，六個月爲一期，期滿抽籤，中籤第一號一名，得分紅一千萬元。第二號二名，各得分紅一百萬元。第三號六名，各得分紅五十萬元。第四號一百名，各得五萬元。乙種規定每一萬戶爲一個團體，每戶儲十萬元，三佩月爲一期。期滿抽籤，中籤第一號一名得分紅五百萬元。第二號二名，各得分紅二百萬元。第三號一百名，各得分紅十萬元。惟乙種每戶得各分爲兩戶，每戶存五萬元，其分紅亦按二分之一計算。甲乙兩種期滿，仍各還本息，甲種息一分，乙種息六釐。</p>
<h3>腸衣成本劇增</h3>
<p>生活指數解凍後，陽衣業多不能維持，宣吿歇業，據悉：目前實際成本，每桶已達一千一百五十餘萬元，而美國市價僅合聯幣七百二十二萬元須虧四百三十餘萬，英國則祗五百七十五萬元，虧五百七十餘萬元，瑞士雖可售一千〇九十餘萬，但需額微，納胃已足，故腸衣業極爲暗淡，無法出口。</p>
<h3>美金債券募銷委會　發表募銷成績　挨戶勸募計劃已經過去</h3>
<p>據美金債券募銷委會發表，美金債券募銷成績，自債券開始募銷日起，迄六月十七日止，短期庫券共銷美金一七·〇二九·二九〇元，美金公債共銷美金二〇·六〇一·三〇〇元。又各地中央銀行分支機構經莫成績細數，有如下述：</p>

<h3>對外埠複製業　紡建昨初次配紗　本市九十家廠商暫予停配</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售八六五件，全部售予廠商，申購者共二六二戶。</p>
<p>昨日該公司第一次對外埠複製業配紗，計昨日所售之八六五件紗中，外埠廠商佔四二九件。其分配標準，係根據各廠開工織機台數，再參酌紡建公司棉紗之供應量，打一適當折扣，規定在每月第三週之星期三，配售一次。昨日配售情形，計常州一四〇件，無錫八〇件，常熟六五件，南匯五〇件，江陰三五件，寗彼三〇件，蘇州一八件，松江六件，靖江五件。</p>

<h3>捲烟買氣旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟晨開即有同業紛起抵補，兼以銀根稍鬆，塲中轉賣稀少，賈氣旺盛。籌碼調劑不充，行情遂被哄上。迨至午市，最後十支大英烟比上日回漲十四萬元，爲六百四十八萬元。老刀烟亦升十六萬元，五華哈德門升七八萬元，其餘華商烟亦微堅。全日趨勢，以美貨六根條烟節禮銷路活潑，門市帮搜求每條上升一千五百元，馬力斯駱駝等好起四五百元，聽裝烟茄力克塲中互做頗多，牌價掛升至五萬二千元。</p>
<h3>食糖續見鬆弛</h3>
<p>昨糖市以去化仍呆，趨勢依然不振，續見下降，公會劃盤，秘魯砂五十四萬六千元至四千元，小萬餘元。二〇中砂白四十三萬元，小萬五千元。三半車白四十八萬元，小萬元。合赤三十六萬元。號貨開出提靑二十九萬五千元至廿九萬元，棉赤三十三萬五千元，均小萬元許。刁靑二十八萬元，興化白四十三萬五千元至四十三萬元，興赤三十三萬至三十一萬五千元，均小萬餘元。共成交三百件之譜。</p>
<h3>茶市略見盤好</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，仍僅午昌及培豐等茶葉公司尙有問津，餘均趦起不前，致交易寥洛如故，過程在此種情形下，變動至爲狹隘。他若紅綠茶內銷，本街店莊及蘇州帮依然活絡，人心遂亦帶堅，賣戶扳抬之意，繼續演出。行情雖未顯著猛晋，但比前迂迴見升，底盤至爲穩定，預測前途，恐仍多看好。</p>
<h3>蠶絲小組審查會　定今日上午舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部中央標準局，定於十九日上午九時，假本市武進路二一六號中蠶公司，舉行蠶絲小組審査會議，由葛敬中氏主持。出席者將有湯錫祥，鄒景衡·王行素·沈九如·陳文沛·尹良瑩等二十餘人。席間將討論生絲整理·包裝·檢査·分級等標準間題。</p>

<p>聯合國社會曁經濟理事會於去年六月第二屆會議時，經美代表提議，在該理事會所屬五委員會之一，經濟曁就業委會下，設置「破壞區城經濟建設臨時分委員會，當由全體一致通過，並規定於次屆理事會議，就左列二點提出意見：</p>
<p>（一）歐洲及亞洲受戰爭破壞國家經濟建設問題之性質及範團</p>
<p>（二）建設進展情形，及可以有效便利並加速此等國家建設之國際合作辦法。</p>
<p>因認識對經濟建設問題有分區入手之必要，社經理事會特授權該分委員會分兩組工作：以默洲及非洲爲一組，遠東爲一組。委員爲中國，澳洲，比利時，加拿大，捷克，伊蒂奧比亞（阿比西尼亞），　國希臘，印度，荷蘭，紐西蘭，挪威，秘魯，彼蘭，菲律濱，蘇聯，烏克蘭，英國，美國，南斯拉夫等國代表，以法國代表任主席，中國代表任副主席，美國代表任報吿員。歐洲組於去年七月在倫敦召開會議，設四個實地工作隊分區調査，業已調査完畢，提出報吿，建議於理事會應設置一個歐洲經濟委員會。遠東組則留待理事會第三屆會議後再行考慮。</p>
<h3>遠遠東組設置的經過</h3>
<p>去年十月三日，理事會續通過議決案，請聯合國秘書長準備關於亞洲及遠一東各國受戰爭破壞情形及建設需要的背量資料，並布置對有關各區域作初步調查。是項調査工作，交由亞洲及遠東組担任。（該組光於八月九日即已集會）。</p>
<p>該組原定在南京開會，研究秘書處所準備的資料，及從初步實地調査並從各國政府得來的情報，又當準備初步報吿提出於理事會。但因値聯合國大會開會，秘書處工作繁車，對在南京開會一事，未能作初步準備，故協議定今年二月在紐約舉行，以便準備報吿。</p>
<p>聯合國大會於去年十二月第五十五次全體會議時，承認受破壞區域急迫需要國際合作，當建議「爲給矛受戰爭破壞各國以有效的援助，社經理事會應於次屆會議時，對設置歐洲經濟委員會與亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會一事，予以迅速而贊同之考慮」。</p>
<p>亞洲曁遠東工作組於今年二月十四日開會，是爲第二次會議，前半部爲對秘書處所供給的初步事實資料作置泛的討論，隨分爲兩分組：一組檢討並補充關於各國戰爭破壞與建設進展的事實資料，另一組則作一般的分析，以便作成個別的建議。繼復將兩分組的報吿綜合爲一總報吿，由工作組於三月七日核准提出理事會</p>
<h3>亞洲各國經濟情勢</h3>
<p>中國</p>
<p>在戰時陣亡達九百萬人，受傷或疾病死亡者爲數亦極鉅。去年因饑致死的人數，頗爲驚人，被毁於戰爭的機器及輕金屬工業生產力達百分之九十，煤，電力及鋼鐵工業生產力百分之七十，棉紡業百分之五十八，戰四航業百分之八十，公路百分六十五。上海生活指數，在一九四六年十一月較一九三七年滑五千三百餘倍，（按今年五月爲二三五〇〇倍。）</p>
<p>恢復運輸系統在中國經濟建設上，須先於其他一切。棉花及紡織機　，亦極爲需要，以便供給人民衣着，煤礦與電力頗屬急需，以帮恢復其他工業。中國的敎育需要，如大學圖書館，試騐儀器，及有訓練之技術人員，均非靠國外來源不可。農業需要包括肥田料及牛種。醫藥物資已由聯總及美國剩餘物資項下有過大量供給，但是醫學校及醫院仍急需醫藥物資及器材。</p>
<p>越南</p>
<p>在淪陷期間，因受戰事，敵人掠奪及佔領政權與軍事作戰所加財政負担的結果，所遭戰爭毁損至鉅，越盟經濟建設中居首要的，就是要供給人民以棉貨布匹，恢復運輸交通，並供給工具與電機。日人在</p>
<p>馬來</p>
<p>曾屠殺十萬人，故馬來最大的戰爭損失爲人力。戰後倖存的馬來人，因營養不足，及無醫藥治療，體質大壞，目今最急的需要是食米，和衣着紡織物，馬來經濟長期的建設必須使橡皮與錫業恢復新加坡的特殊需要，包括糧食，衣着，屋宇及海港建設。</p>
<p>暹羅</p>
<p>因亞洲其他各國對其輸出品特別是米，都需求甚殷，故目前經濟情况尙屬良好，不過頗需要紡織物及消費物品，鐵路器材，汽車運輸，港口設備，因爲在戰時曾受到同盟軍方面的猛烈轟炸。</p>
<p>香港</p>
<p>復興的主要障碍是米糧短缺，不能够照　界價格取得消費品與原料。</p>
<p>巴普亞與新幾內亞</p>
<p>在太平洋戰爭中做了劇戲的戰塲。到戰爭結束之際，所有住宅全被摧毁，連繫各鳥交通的小船也遭破壞，整個經濟須重新建起。澳洲政府正負責建設新幾內亞與巴普亞的經濟生活，並宣布此項建設將列作開發該區域及使其居民進步的長期方案的一部份。一九四六年</p>
<p>非律濱</p>
<p>的國民收益，照衡定的物價計，只有戰前的三分之二。雖然主要糧食生產已逐漸擴張，尙有輸入米穀與其他糧食的必要。復興工作又因缺乏衣着，醫藥，牲畜，漁業晨業器材，及伐木鋸太機器而受了阻遲菲律濱經濟的長期建設，需要恢復供輸出的工業，這在戰前原本是收益的主要來源，工業器材是恢復礦業，捲烟業，纖維剝製業，榨糖，榨油及其他工業所必要的。對於運輸，交通，房屋，敎育各範圍，也必須予以援助。</p>
<p>北婆羅洲</p>
<p>各大城市都曾大遭戰爭破壞，除屋宇外，英屬婆羅洲還急需米糧與衣着。該地有時不得不以樹皮代衣服。</p>
<p>緬甸</p>
<p>收復後，經濟生活完全脫節，工業陷於停頓，由於雖以取得必要原料，兼缺乏經費，故復興工作進展極慢。運輸系統失序，尤爲復與的最大阻障，重要的硬木業，需有五年的時間纔能恢復，煉油廠更是破壞凈盡，非至重裝新復器，不能有多大的出產。稻出在戰前面積達一千二百萬英畝，現有半數就荒。要經三四年後，纔能恢復耕種。</p>
<p>荷印</p>
<p>的「焦士政策」買及油，錫，航海，海港等重要工業；橡皮及茶　咖啡全被敵人摧毁，改種糧食。運輸系統及工廠受損慘烈。僅爪哇一島，遭日軍所殺，及因饑餓疾病與缺乏醫療而死的，估計約達三百萬人。外圍各島合計約一百萬。</p>

<h3>中國水利　第一渠　涇惠渠復興十五週年</h3>
<p>— 西安十五日航　本報記者李馳</p>
<p>居於焦躁煩閣的古城中，常想起泱泱無涯的海和涓涓細流的溪。同樣的是水，陝省內幾條瀋漑水利裘，在當地以黄壤爲生的農民心目中就是他們的生命綫。</p>
<p>輝煌史蹟</p>
<p>就我國水利文獻所載，陜省水利事業允稱最早。上週六月六日工程師節所紀念的大禹（史家雖未定論是否有其人）擊龍門，平水土，都是在陜境內做的事。其後尙有秦代引永灌田，冲洗鹼性土壤以裁育農作等項記載，就中恐怕以涇水的利用爲最早。遠在公元前二四零年間，秦人利用韓水工鄭國開盤涇河，納冶，淸，漆，沮渚水入於洛，灌田四萬五千頃，曰（鄭國渠）這—頁輝煌的早年紀錄，在世界水利工程史上亦有重要的地位。</p>
<p>鑿渠難，但養渠亦屬不易。秦代的鄭國渠到漢代就因水垠漸毁，河水不完全納入渠中，而水利日喪。漢太始二年趙中大夫白公重修，改稱爲「鄭白渠」。其後歷代有修改，如宋代的「豐利渠，」元代的「王御史渠，」明代的「廣惠渠，」淸代的「龍洞渠，」名字備管變更，實際上依然局部的利用「鄭白渠」，不過灌漑畝數時多時寡，到了淸代雍正年間，不幸淤塞到僅能灌田二百頃。</p>
<p>復興先聲</p>
<p>復興涇河水利的倡議，早在民國九年渭河北岸大旱之後，那時地方士紳想動用賑災餘款，重復「鄭白渠」舊觀。十一年，近代「大禹」　儀社氏任陜省水利局長，積極進行，然終阻於戰禍。延至民十七年至十九年陜境大飢籠後，才着手動工；民廿年陜局穩定，李氏再度主持本省水利行政，先後復得華洋義賑總會，朱子橋和于右任兩氏的協助，第一期工程自十九年　至二十一年夏，完成三道幹渠，並將舊有支渠道整理竣工。仝年六月廿日隆重舉行命名和放水典禮，距今恰歷十五寒暑，當日沿渠鄕晨們的歡騰萬狀，可惜李儀社氏已不能親眼看到；他一個人靜靜躺在北幹渠北岸的墓地，壤濺濺水聲做他永生的良伴！沒有他，就沒有涇惠渠的復興，兩千多年前的鄭國渠依然是歷史殘跡。</p>
<p>今春薩凡奇博士來陝參觀涇惠渠，順道晋謁李氏遺墓，製這位畢生爲了水而與天地搏鬥的獻身者，也低下頭，寫下景仰的語句</p>
<p>民廿二至廿四年繼繽修築第二期工程，並成立涇惠渠管理局，直屬於陝省水利局，以迄於午。</p>
<p>灌溉面積</p>
<p>涇惠渠在陜省水利工程中至今依然佔着「老大哥」的地位，不獨歷史最久，而且灌漑面積亦最廣，關中陝南已放水的九條水渠灌漑總面積約二百萬畝，其中屬涇惠渠區的佔五分之二，即八十二萬畝（民卅五年統計），地區遍及三原，涇陽，高陵等三縣和醴泉，臨潼等兩縣的一部。民卅二年本渠的灌漑面積，曾一度多達九十五萬畝這最高紀錄。全渠共分南北兩幹綫，再分八條支渠，水流方向是自西向東。</p>
<p>生產統計</p>
<p>光從灌漑面積統計數字還不易看出本渠對該區農作的施惠。這裏我們不妨引用去年度的統計：由本渠灌漑的大小麥種植面積爲卅四萬畝，產量四十四萬市石；雜糧（即玉米·大豆及其他）十四萬畝，產量十七萬市石，合計食糧六十一萬市石。另植棉面積卅萬畝，產量達二十萬市擔。順便一提：去年的統計數字因有其他因素影響，收穫量並不理想。十五年來徑惠渠區作物最高的紀錄爲民廿八年，計食糧收穫達一百一十萬市石，這數字比去年的將近趙出一倍；另棉花廿八萬市擔，比去年超出百分之四十。至於每單位面積的增產量，依本省一般的統計：則開渠灌漑後種棉的增加百分之百，（旱田每市畝約收穫棉花卅行，水利渠灌漑區則收穫六十斤），種麥子的增加百分之六十。（即旱田每畝收穫麥子一市石，水利渠灌漑區收穫一市石六市斗）。</p>
<p>養渠不易</p>
<p>鑿渠難，養渠亦屬不易。兩千多年來涇河水利的滄桑史正是絕好的明證。從積極方面說，開發新渠固是重要，但從消極方面說，如何使灌溉面積繼續維持長高數量，不致渠道壅塞，水流量减低，亦屬同樣艱難。民卅四年以前，陜省各渠的管理費用和員工食糧，全由國庫負擔，但自去年起，除極少津貼外，幾乎完全由地方籌支，在這種情况下，省府祗好用「以渠養渠」來維持，換句話說，渠道的修繕管理開支，要沿渠受益田畝的農民來平均負擔。上月本省參政會中，就有人指摘過「水費微實」後加重了農民負擔。</p>
<p>一方面計劃水的供給和繼續供給，他方面考慮如何减輕鄕農負擔至最少限度，應該是本月廿五日在西安舉行的陜省水利會議一個主題，不祗涇惠渠一渠而已。</p>

<h3>拉瑪丁的自傳小說</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>書名　葛萊齊拉　作者拉瑪丁（法）　譯者　陸　　出版　文化生活出版社</p>
<p>一個十八歲的靑年，離開了法蘭西，到溫暖可愛的南方旅　。後來他到了伊大利的拿波里，旅居數月，時正初夏，維蘇威火山，加斯達拉瑪拉　泉，以及拿波里灣畔的碧海靑天白雲，給這個早慧的法國少年多少惆悵的微笑，和微笑的惆悵。他和一個比他長兩歲的朋友，整日在那舟之中，帆之旁，天之下，海之上，將現實和幻想混在一塊兒，過着輝煌溫暖的良宵和長　，享受大自然的神妙。</p>
<p>他們認識一個普洛西達的漁夫，這個名呌安特烈的老人和他的十二歲的孫兒貝賓諾，有一隻彩色煊爛的小艇，船尾上還嵌着聖弗朗桑的小小雕像。兩個年靑人時常要求安特烈讓他們到船上去做學習的漿手。一灣又一灣，一礁又一礁，光陰在海波聲中流着，流着……九月挾着雷和雨開始了。</p>
<p>那一次，海上不平靜了，脆弱的小船和暴風巨浪掙扎，四個人的生命，在生死中掙扎。最後，他們只有將船艙中的一切都拋入海中，水瓶，魚籃，巨帆，鐵錨，繩索，衣包及行囊，一齊犧牲了，總算他們平安的抵達了普洛西達崖岸。又因爲夜來風大的原故，小艇也壞了。</p>
<p>在島的近岸，一所小屋中，住着安特烈的妻子，和他們的孫女—葛來齊拉，也就是小水手貝賓諾的姊姊，還有兩個更小的孩子，他的弟弟。</p>
<p>有一晚，葛萊齊拉聽兩個靑年中較小的一個說「波兒與維齊尼」的故事，這個單純的女孩子感動了，在維齊尼的心靈中發現了牠自己，故事說完了，垂盡的燈火在不知不覺間熄去，牠流了許多激動的淚水，第一次牠知道了愁？第一次牠知道了愛？</p>
<p>過了幾天的良辰，他們全都離開普洛西達。安特烈全家要搬到委哲里拿去，要冬天才再回來。兩個年靑人也回到他們拿波里的寓所。——這時候，那較長的一個，因爲姊姊遣嫁回法國去了，只留下那個十八歲的，孤獨的住在拿波里，他爲什麼不和他的朋友一起回國呢？是不是那海上的生涯，漁夫的小屋，葛萊齊拉的情影，呌他迷戀？</p>
<p>最後他病了，憔悴而蒼自，是無名的憂鬱病，葛萊齊拉聞訊從麥哲里拿趕來，熟心體貼的照應，並且借給他一枚小小的銀質的聖像，第二天醒來，他就痊愈了。不顧軟弱的病體，他乘了馬車到委哲里拿去。安特烈一家親切的歡迎他，並留他再一次的住下。</p>
<p>從秋末到冬初，拿波里的天色是那樣明期晴美，葛萊齊拉的技藝和容顏是那樣日益的出色，他的心是那樣感受到甘美的安息和平靜的甜蜜。但是他從不曾承認過，甚至想到過自己愛上了這美麗的海島姑娘自然他也不覺得自己被愛。一個可愛的伴侶，好朋友，親熱的姊妹似的；他不曾想到其他。直到有一天，聖誕節的前夕，蔡佐的父親來爲兒子求婚了，安特烈夫婦爲孫女美滿幸福的米來而高興，葛萊齊拉却悒悒不歡，起初他們以爲這是少女的羞怯，過幾時就會平靜的。那個寄居的法國靑年，在一刹那間，忽然發覺他對葛萊齊拉的情感原來不楚坦白的友誼，而是强烈的愛戀，他的心激動了，精神不安了，全心震慄，徹夜無眼，痴子樣的離開了安特烈的草舍，元旦後，他再到麥哲里拿，發現一切都大大改變，葛萊齊拉整天的哭，不做工，將目己關在屋子裏，不見人。蔡佐的父親每天在等回音，但是她不願意，不願意。好容易這一晚，她爲祖父母的請求和蔡佐的眼淚折服，接受了表兄的戒指。這一晚，他回來了，聽見這消息，覺得一陣寒戰，他在她的房門前走路說話，但是她仍是無聞，無言，不見。他只好也去睡覺了。</p>
<p>夜來有暴風雨，早起却是皎潔晴明的冬之晨，葛萊齊拉走了，留下她的衣飾和錢，給她的家人；她的小小的銀質的聖像，一朵戴過的石榴花，給那個法國少年；戒指還給表兄；還有一張紙片，說她寗願做女修道士，不欲答應這件婚事。</p>
<p>蔡佐讓步了，家中也只盼望她歸來，別的什麼也不提，於是偵騎四出，找尋，找尋。最復，在普洛西達的故居，那個法國靑年找到了葛萊齊拉，她已經被激情折磨得變了形，這個可憐的女孩子，在漸漸回復了生氣之後，靈魂的幃幕自此揭去，終於吿訴了他「她愛他」！</p>
<p>葛萊齊拉比以前更美了，但是她的長睫毛的大眼裏藏着哀愁，愛情能令人美，更能令人憂鬱，她明白他們的樂園是築在雲端裏的。一個拿波里海島的姑娘，一個法國的有錢少年，怎能永久在一塊兒呢！</p>
<p>五月末的夜晚，他的母親托人雇定了馬匹催他即刻上道，不容猶豫，月光下的曬台上，葛萊齊拉暈倒了，難堪的別離，也是永久的別離。</p>
<p>回到法國，起初收到她的信，後來她病了，漸漸的沒有消息，他刻刻在念，但是究竟太年輕，正當負義的年齡，爲了懼怕惡劣的殘謔，虛榮的挖苦，他將這聖潔的愛情委棄在沙土中，冬天來了，他沒有重踐去拿波里的約，雖然他並不曾遺忘葛萊齊拉。十二月初的夜晚，他得着一個不相識的旅客帶來的紙條。——葛萊齊拉死了？</p>
<p>這就是葛業齊拉的故事，也是拉瑪爾丁的初戀，拉瑪爾丁是法國十九世紀的文學家，葛萊齊拉據說實有某人，不過不是珊瑚女，而是拿波里城中紙烟廠的一一個女工，拉瑪爾丁在一八一一年曾經到伊大利去旅行。他一生曾好幾次戀愛，在一八一九年與一英國少女結婚，備極幸福。但是可憐的葛萊齊拉的形象，在記憶裏卻永永不能忘懷，最初的種子最不易拔去，一八三〇年的一個晚上，他在巴黎一個敎堂裏，看見抬進一具少女的棺木，蓋着白布，他想起葛萊齊拉，流着眼淚，舒開在長篇累積中寫着的記憶，寫下一首「初悼」的長詩。來懺悔他十八歲時候的負義和無情</p>
<p>「葛萊齊拉」在法國文學中也許並不是一部絕頂輝煌的名著，但是我們却無法否認，它在作者的回憶裏，如同黑夜孤舟上的燈火，在人烟不及的遠處，愈遠愈顯得光明。每一個人的第一次的悲哀，將是他自己情感的花園裏一朶最　最珍貴的蓓蕾。羅曼羅關曾經說過：「……那是生命的狂流無法衝掉的，每個人的心底，都有一座埋藏愛人的墳墓。他們在其中成年累月的睡着，什麽也不來驚醒他們。但終有一天——我們知道——地窰會重新打開。死者將從墳墓裏出來，褪色的口唇會向愛人嫣然微笑；他們的前　往事原來潛伏在愛人胸中，有如兒童躺在海腹裏一樣。……」就是這一天，拉瑪爾丁的S的墳　打開了，當「葛萊齊拉」的故事寫成的時候。</p>
<p>有誰見過白髮蕭條的老婦人，怎樣在她寂寞的房中，悄悄的打開那蒙上塵埃的七寳盒？那裏面鎖着多少珍珠，翡翠，琥珀的飾物，還有那些看不見的昨日的靑春和年華。正像那老婦人的七寳盒一樣，這本書裏也鎖着多少懺悔，幸福，回憶，又多少微笑和多少眼淚。</p>
<h3>讀富蘭克林傳</h3>
<p>— 艾文</p>
<p>書名Benjamin　Franklin</p>
<p>著者Carl　Van　Doren</p>
<p>出版Overseas　Editions,　Inc,　New　York</p>
<p>小孩子時代在國語敎科番就讀過關於富氏生平的文字，腦子中早有這個偉人的印象。中學時期又讀過他的自傳）Erankin's　Autobiography），對於他的刻苦自勵，非常驚佩。惜該書不全，且他在社會上科學上的成就都語多不詳，深以爲憾，今日讀了道倫氏的富氏傳，方覺暢然。</p>
<p>「另一只船從倫敦載來富蘭克林九天之後抵達的新聞。費城等待得在不時的騷動……大鐘響着當他踏上街道的時候……不止一週的連續不斷地儀式去歡迎他。民衆只給他少許的時候去休息……」（頁四六四）。在法國辦理外交，協助革命，功成歸國，受着莫大的榮譽踏上被英人蹂躪過的家園，富氏是如何的偉大啊！</p>
<p>富氏怎樣到這地位是我們要讀下去的；他從小印刷所的學徒而報館經理，而郵局局長，而大使，以至行政長官。另一方面是只讀了兩年書而成爲名聞全球的學者，科學家，文學家，哲學家，政治家。其間經歷多少世事的變動，屹然不爲潮流所遺葉，有主張，有見地。他未走錯一步路。這不是偶然或幸運；而是高超的修養與實際行動配合一致而成的。他底自傳吿訴我們他怎樣磨練自己，道氏書內則吿訴我們他怎樣去應用。尤其是在贊成革命的前夕的時候。（頁二七五—頁三三三）</p>
<p>富氏一生是一部偉大的歷史，正如道氏在該書末頁所云：「……富蘭克林不是僅如那些有咎於成爲偉大的機遇者。在任何一年，任何一地，富蘭克林必將成爲偉人。思想與意志，才能與機巧，堅强與安靜，智慧與文雅聚在他一身好像自然曾過寵但歡喜他的造成似的。沒有一件看上去被遺漏除了熱中的慾望，有如頂聰明的一些人；一切的統治者，兵士，聖徒，詩人，學者，以及有一點天賦或優點或成功者一樣。富蘭克林從始至終是在一個馴良的平衡之中……」。</p>
<p>道氏的著作就是「歷史」的史詩，他的成就無須我多曉舌，該書曾得一九三九年美國Pulitzer獎金的傳記獎。行文簡潔，生動，雖繁不惹厭。取材廣博，引證衆多；亦如該書底面介紹中云：「可贊地道倫先生繼承這個工作，許多材料曾爲公衆迄未發現，許多已知者都被簡省且作新的分析置在頂可靠的一面。眞實的，富氏自傳此時此地是被完成在他自己的水準與詞句間了。——」所憾者該書叙述缺少文藝氣氛，然而這也不足爲病，是未足損其價値。</p>
<p>際此今日，鄙意少年人靑年人甚至老年人都有一讀該書的義務。尤其是年紀小一點的，因爲該書可以指示你生活上學識途徑上道德磨練上的一切的一切。</p>

<h3>台灣地理</h3>
<p>— 震凡</p>
<p>著者：宋家泰　出版：正中書局</p>
<p>勝利已將近二年：可是關於合灣方面書籍出版不多，有成績者更鮮，就台灣地理方面論，坊間所發行者或爲小册，或爲指南中一部，有深入獨到之專著出版者，僅正中書局出版宋家泰著之「台灣地理」。</p>
<p>該書內容，以台灣本島及附近諸島如琉球澎湖等島爲限，分爲十一章。第一章爲槪論，叙述台灣島地理上特點：如狹長之形狀，陸島之位置，多山之地勢，平直之海岸，熱帶之氣候，豐富之物產，繁衍之人口，發達之交通等。第二章爲地形及構造，叙述山脈及其構造，平原與河川，海岸。第三章爲氣候與植物，叙台灣之氣溫，雨量，氣壓與風，濕度雲量日照，高山氣候，自然植物。第四章爲農業（附水產），此章內容最佳，因農業經濟爲台灣之經濟基礎，故關於農業農產方面不厭求詳，如歷年耕地面積數，農家戶數，及農業人口，以及米，甘庶，甘薯，茶等栽培面積及產量等，均爲吾人研究台灣農業方面資料。第五，六，七，八，九，十章分爲林產，礦產，工業，交通，貿易，及居民。第十一章爲都邑，詳述都市分佈，台灣九大都市—台北，高雄，台南，基隆，嘉義，台中，新竹，彰化及屛東。及其他重要都市。並附以澎湖列島及其他島嶼，如琉球，紅頭嶼，火燒島，小紅頭嶼，龜山島等。</p>
<p>該書一册，共計一七二頁，圖表搜羅豐富，其中之台灣地形東西斷面圖，地質圖，氣溫圖，雨量圖，氣候要素圖，產業構成圖，農，林，擴資源圖，人口分佈圖，尤爲不易多見地圖。</p>
<p>台灣爲我國沿海第一大島，北與琉球羣島相接，東面太平洋，南隔巴士海峽和呂宋島相遙對，兼有大陸與海洋之勝，其位置可謂優越。日本佔領五十年期間，積極建設鑛山，都市林立，鐵道密佈，致使一躍爲富庶繁盛之區，日人視爲寳庫。今者抗戰勝利，在日本蹂躪下五十年之台灣，復歸祖國懷抱，這對我國政治、經濟前途何等重要。不揣譾陋，介紹比較完善的地理　一册，或不致兌議於大方罷。</p>
<h3>文藝的基本問題</h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>（鐸尼克著，集敏之譯，文光書店版）</p>
<p>「偉大的藝術，首先要求藝術工作者有崇高偉大的理想和人格，要求他們有堅苦奮鬥的精神」。</p>
<p>這句話是不錯的，無論那一種藝衛，沒有「堅苦奪鬥的精神」，是斷然不會成功的。</p>
<p>關於文藝，這是目前大多數知識靑年所注意着的，而却有很多靑年，對於文藝的基本問題，沒有淸淅的瞭解，祗是棋糢糊糊的懂得一點。有的雖然常常讀文藝作品，而對於文藝之基本問題，也不免有這種的模糊現象。</p>
<p>在這一本小書裏面，它就要解除靑年們的這種模糊觀念。</p>
<p>本書中，就文藝的基本之問題，分別述之如下：</p>
<p>一，美學和它所研究的對象，它說明美學的任務，是在對作爲人類認識反映的藝術的本質，與它發展的一般規律，自然與社會一切相互關聯的寳庫，各種各式的人類的活動，以及人類感情，思想等等諸形象中的創作的複寫，做一個硏究。</p>
<p>進而說出美學的社會性與歷史性：它不但在於確足藝術作品與某種社會形式之間的關係，並且是闡明這些作品的客觀的藝術的意義。在社會的歷史發展，和在人們生產活動的歷史發展的過程當中，不但藝術的觀感起了變化，同時藝術本身，現實的藝術的感覺，以及基本的審美範疇的理解，也一同起了變化。</p>
<p>二，藝術上的特性與內容：它講出藝術本身包括四個基本相互的招機：（一）典型與個性的統一；（二）形式與內容的統一；（三）藝術具體性的特性；（四）藝術幻想的特性。</p>
<p>次之，是說到藝術上的美：藝術與任何一稱藝術的活動，它本身都是「按照美的法則」；從而詳說這種「美的法則」。</p>
<p>三，什麼呌做昇華？希求通過醜惡的表現形態與隱藏在表現形態背後的精神生活的內心的美善之間的對立，達到昇華成就的境地。</p>
<p>四，悲劇：從事鬥爭而必然趨於滅亡的全世界史的力量，其必然衛突，才構成了悲劇的基礎。</p>
<p>五，喜劇：它是現實中喜劇的藝術描繪。</p>
<p>最後，本書說明了文藝的人民性，與新現實主義。</p>
<p>觀乎這些內容，對文藝的基本問題，的確作了明而確的答覆，愛好文藝的靑年，要瞭解這些問題，不妨一　此書。</p>

<h3>自然界的超性感覺</h3>
<p>— 郭永年</p>
<p>人類雖天賦有種種知覺上的優點，但有許多感覺方面的靈敏性尙逮不及動物所有的高超，例如對「時間」的感覺來說：假使你已有數小時未看鐘錶，你試猜現在該是幾點幾分鐘？再以鐘錶指示的眞確鐘點核對一下，猜錯了半小時？或一刻鐘？在這一點上，小小的一只蜜蜂就比我們强多了。英國的科學家曾作過這樣精密的實騐：以每日固定時間出示食料供給自遠處飛來的蜜蜂，這班蜜蜂的來臨竟從來不會錯過五分鐘！這使我們有鐘錶的人有些慚愧莫及了。再以飲咖啡時放入一匙羹糖爲例，如放少了就不覺得有甜味，據實騐知我們人類感覺甜味的程度是二百份之一，（即至少需以一份的糖調入二百份同量的液體中，始能覺得其甜味。）而蒼蠅却能自四萬份中感覺一份的糖質；但蜜蜂更能自三十萬份中覺察到一份糖的甜味。</p>
<p>又譬如以周圍溫度的變化來講，至少溫度計要上下到好幾度，始能使人類有所感覺，這在野獸方面就靈敏銳利得多了。美國自然科學博物院的科學家，以吊起的同形不同熟度之兩燈泡放在響尾蛇前，每次變更該二泡之溫度，響尾蛇始終以身撲向溫度較高的燈泡，又每次將相差的溫度遞减，最終二泡只相差不到攝氏十分之二度，該蛇亦能覺察。</p>
<p>如以聽覺爲例，動物心理學家曾試過普通的犬，均能聽到放在距牠四十呎地方一只錶的滴嗒聲，但聽覺最銳利的人就很難在距四呎的地方聽到了。禽學家發現「知更鳥」在草地上跳躍時，常以頭部傾側及地面，搜聽地面下蚯蚓的動靜，以便覓食。</p>
<p>其他如魚類體旁的中心綫，能感覺水的壓力；蜜蜂之所以能急急忙忙地，以很快的速度在花叢中穿來飛去，是依靠人類肉眼所不能見的紫外光綫作引導；柳　魚能黑暗中逆流急速上游，而不會誤撞在石塊；甚至最渺小不過的蝸牛，如將其眼珠割去，牠仍能感覺到在其肉體上照着的光綫或經過的影子。</p>
<h3>選舉的標準　——哈薩族故事之二</h3>
<p>— 朴園</p>
<p>馬主席派來陪我們的鄭方谷君，是靑海兒童劇團的領導人，他，不特很喜歡哈薩的民歌，且也能採取許多抗戰的故事，配上許多維吾爾的，藏族的，哈薩的歌曲，交給他的靑海兒童劇團演出，使得凡是看過這類小歌劇的人，都對邊疆的少數同胞，有很好的印象。</p>
<p>我們常在西寗市上看到一些哈薩人，覺得他們那種哈着胸脯，翹着屁股，撥開腿走着瞞跚的步子的樣子，實在愚笨得很，但，據鄭君說，這形態，正足證明他們是慣於馬上生活的人，「如果一到了馬上」，鄭君說，「他們的精神立刻就振作起來，他們眞正表現了我們想像中的英雄」</p>
<p>一般的說，他們是良善的，可是，在迫不得已的時候，他們也會變得很殘忍。「有過這樣的事，」鄭君說，「三個要好的哈薩一路走，路上，餓得了不得，一時又找不到東西吃，於是，另外兩個商量着，就把第三個人吃了；後來，另外的兩個人，又給他的朋友吃了一個——您別笑，這是眞的，他們原是吃生肉的啊！」</p>
<p>「他們有一個習慣」，鄭君說，「留在中國境內的哈薩，也分成許多小部落，藏匿在山裏，可是，每一個小部落，都有一個領袖，這領袖是選舉出來的，也許是價老年，中年，或者少年人；選舉的標準，要看各人帽子上的鳥類的毛，毛最多的就當選，而這毛，却是殺人的標識，殺一次人，就加一根毛！」</p>
<p>在西北，野獸中跑得最快的是　羊，而，在馬上的哈薩克、是可以無論在平原，在草地，在沙漠，在山裏，很容易地趕上牠們，並捉住牠們的。他們的生活，有來自游獵的，近年多半以搶刧爲生，「西北的旅行商人，不是習慣於成羣結隊地走路嗎？」鄭君說，「主要的原因、還是怕哈薩，他們一硬到就要搶的。」</p>
<h3>鹹蛋的謎</h3>
<p>— 寗頗</p>
<p>故都某大學美籍敎授密爾士氏，喜食中國的鹹鴨蛋，它曾說過一段笑話：「從前有一位初到中國的美國人，嗜着中國鹹蛋的味甚美，當時心中很懷疑蛋的鹹法，細看蛋売，旣完卵未破，鹽何由入？味怎能鹹？一個疑團，因無從得知，惟腹秘緘默而待。一日應華友的邀宴，廚役進鹹鴨全隻，它始恍然大悟說：原來中國還有鹹鴨，難怪要生鹹蛋了」</p>
<p>影譚</p>
<h3>「失去的週末」</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>「失去的週末」是一九四六年十大名片的冠軍，雷米倫因主演此片而獲得最佳演技的金像獎，這部小說是美國近年來的暢銷書，也許因爲甚暢銷的小說，才被改編而搬上銀慕。</p>
<p>這個故事非常平淡，是描寫一個從事著作的靑年，因爲事業上的許多苦問，便終日沉湎於醉鄉，把他所有的時間金錢都投擲於酒吧間中，終於走到了身敗名裂的邊隷，將永墜於不可收拾之境。後來幸得他愛人數度的勸勉鼓勵，才覺悟到自己的前途與酒絕綠。</p>
<p>也許是民族性的不同，在西洋禁酒是一件嚴重的事情，曾經因禁酒而發生過暴動，而在我們的國度裏，酒，似乎是並不嚴重的一會事，所以這部「失去的週末」在好萊塢可以獲得十大名片的冠軍，而在我們看來却並不是一部突出的佳作。</p>
<p>即使從劇本的內容上來講，那末，作者也沒有强調的說明男主角唐恩爲什麽不能在事業上獲得發展，在資本主義的社會裏，一個從事文化工作的靑年如何被抑壓着，苦悶使他走個了變態的生活，那末這樣一種情形之下，一個女友憑着她愛情的鼓勵，恐怕依然是不能澈底解決唐恩所感到的苦悶。</p>
<p>——但是，作者似乎並不從這些地方去着眼，他只要求做到勸人爲善，不要把大好的光陰虛擲於醉鄕而已，本來好萊塢的劇本是無法要求過高的。</p>
<p>値得一提的是雷米倫的演技，他細膩深刻的表演了唐恩這個醉鬼的心理過程，酒吧間中與蝙蝠幻影等幾塲戲，在演技上有着高度的收獲。差不多全片只是他一個人的戲。其他，唐恩的愛人與酒吧間的老闆，都極能稱職地表演了人物的性格。</p>
<p>導演與攝影均在水準以上。</p>
<h3>同情郵電加價</h3>
<p>— 黑子</p>
<p>因爲補貼政策的取消，國營事業現在都在紛紛加價了，政府此次的取消補貼政策，是十分合理的。我們並不反對補貼政策，不過如果祗是局部的津貼，尤其如某些大都市公用事業加以津貼。那就値得硏究了，因爲以國庫來負担特定地區的津貼。這就等於全體國民來負祖一部份人的拿受，這是頗不確當的。</p>
<p>報載，郵資即將加價，提增百分之五百，我們最爲同情，這不是筆者可在漲價競賽中隔江觀火，也不是爲了郵政日新又新，辦事精神與效率値得嘉許。而是爲了减輕國庫的負担，亦即减輕人民的負担。誠然，郵政爲一最爲公衆的事業，每個人都多少與郵局有所往來，但是往來最頻繁的還是商人，這與電報一樣，他們仗此兩者，互通商情，連絡市塲，接洽賣買；至於包裏寄遞，交寄最多最巨的也是商界。如果以低廉的郵資與寄費交寄，而其巨大差額由政府負担，這眞如要人民來爲商人負担一大半的郵資與寄費，這是多麼不合理的事情，所以取消補貼，實行加價，我對郵政當局此舉十分同情，也十分贊成。</p>
<p>因此，我也同情電報加價，我也贊成政府取消對電訊局的補貼，我覺得這倒是能减輕而並不加重人民負担的。</p>
<h3>近親結婚</h3>
<p>— 奚磐石</p>
<p>我常聽見別人講，或是親眼目睹許多已結婚的夫婦，都是近親結婚，但他們所得的子孫，差不多是殘疾，或是畸形發展的，然而等他們的子孫長大以後，再和別人結婚，而所得的子女，大都是遺傳着他父母們不良的氣質。例如據Benis調査，三十組近親結婚中，他的後代一共有三千九百四十二人，手足殘廢者佔百分之二八。七，聾啞的佔百分之三·六，盲目的佔百分之二·一，畸形發展的佔百分之二·四，患瘋顛症的佔百分之七·五，瘰骨的佔百分之七·六，幼年夭折的佔百分之廿二，健全的佔百分之廿四，因此下去，他以後的子孫一定是不優良的。要避免這種情形，在積極方面，在沒有結婚前的男女，必須預先調査對方的氣質是否優良，千萬不要近親聯姻，在消種方面，對患有各種疾病的，一律應使他們，不能生殖。</p>
<h3>左宗棠精神</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>讀淸史，光緒元年（西曆一八七七年），左宗棠對新疆回亂問題，獨排衆議，其上疏書略謂：「重新疆，所以保蒙古；保蒙古，所以衛京師；俄人托境日廣，由西而東萬餘　，與我北境相連，僅中段隔有蒙古，徙薪宜速，曲突宜先。」又云：「臣一介書生，位極人臣，今年已六十有五，何敢妄貪天功，惟伊犁旣歸俄有（一八七一年——同治十年，俄國恐阿古柏新興勢力占據伊犁，爲申張其勢力，在保護國境名義下占領伊犁首都之惠遠城，至一八八一年聖彼得堡條約，伊犁歸回問題始行解決），阿古柏又據喀什噶爾，若置之不問，必有日蹙百里之勢，後患何堪設想。」</p>
<p>其時左宗棠爲陜甘總督，對於甘肅回亂尙未平定。淸政府對新疆用兵，歲達軍餉千餘萬兩，帑藏竭蹶，有人主張棄新疆南八城，封阿古柏爲外藩；且阿古柏頗有政治手段，旣爲土耳其等回敎國相洽，又與英俄等締結商約，英使威妥瑪亦屢向淸廷建議封阿古柏爲外藩。在這種情勢之下，左宗棠斷然願出兵西討，並於一八七八年平定新疆全部。其冒險舉動，我們讀史者爲他揑着一把冷汗，其老壯精神，實使後人爲之敬佩不已。</p>
<p>假使左宗棠不西征，允許阿古柏爲藩屬，（據史記載，阿古柏治理地方，有完備的警察，人民殆無犯罪事件），則新疆地方固早非爲我所有，即靑海甘肅等地，亦恐早已生了問題。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>到了站外，他首先向住在小屋裏的鄉民打聽有沒有可以設法的交通工具，結果一無所有，除非雇一個人代他背負緋緋，可是緋緋又堅決不要。最後，才由老祝向一個老人問明了去南丹的最近的路徑，又向他買了幾塊似餅非餅的麥製的乾糧，便在暮色蒼茫下，奮然路上了灰黑色的土路</p>
<p>最初緋緋很安靜，沒有哭，也沒有嚷頭痛；富老祝走了十來里路，停下來，坐在一塊大石上休息的時候，就把她打背上放下，讓她喝去了從車站上裝到的一小瓶開水的一半，她便什麼話也不說，倒在老祝懷裏就想睡覺。老祝爲着她，又故意多坐子一會，心裏也略覺寬放。他打自已的小皮箱裏取出了一支手電筒和六七顆他收藏已久的奶油糖，但祗吃了一塊，覺得遠沒有往常那樣的甜，便仍把餘下的丢進了箱子去。</p>
<p>這時候，手錶上的短針已越過八點了，老祝抬頭望望有星無月的靑灰色的天空，又試了試緋緋額上的溫度，實在覺得不能再躭擱了；他輕輕地喚醒緋緋，讓她仍像方才那樣的馱在自已背上，外用一方包袱究住。</p>
<p>緋緋揉着倦眼，勉强依着辦了，可是走了很短的一段路，她就開始呻吟起來；老祝回頭去撫慰她，她只是哽咽着儘喊頭痛。起初老祝還以爲是孩子想睡沒有睡，所以這樣吵，但又元了三四十碼路，他的背部吿訴他緋緋不但在吵，在哭，而且身子扭動得非常劇烈。</p>
<p>對於帶領孩子毫無經騐的祝兆年不由手足無措起來。他慌忙解開胸剪的扣子，鬆掉包袱，忽忽把緋緋放下，這時候這孩子的腿也沒有勁了，連一分鐘也站不住，待老祝轉過身去，她已癱倒在地上。</p>
<p>「緋緋！緋緋！」老祝一面呌喚，一面急急把他抱在懷裏。自已就用兩個　藍跪在地上。</p>
<p>緋緋只是呻吟、頭頸時時向後　曲，眼珠都泛到了上面去，像要暈厥的樣子。老祝忙力自鎭靜，抽出一條手來拉過那只摔在一旁的小皮箱、摸索到那個水瓶和盛着僅餘的一片大健凰的小玻璃管。</p>
<p>「緋緋，喝水，喝一些水就好了！」他費了極大的勁，才把那顆藥片搯碎，　進緋緋的嘴唇去；司是才灌了一口水，緋緋便突然打個　心，把藥和水一起吐掉了</p>

<h3>Bitter Fighting in Siping Continues: City Buildings Destroyed by Artillery Fire; Fierce Battles South of Changchun at Pingdingshan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] The Battle of Siping has been raging day and night for the past three days. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented since the recovery of the Northeast. Both the Nationalists and the Communists know that this battle is crucial to their success or failure, and they are fighting hard to achieve victory. The street fighting in Siping City, involving hand-to-hand combat, is proceeding with extreme brutality on the 18th. Only a few major buildings remain standing in the city, with the rest destroyed by artillery fire and bombs. Civilian casualties are very high, and the Communist forces call it a war of annihilation.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 18th] The fierce battle of Siping has continued for a week. The Communist forces have launched repeated fierce attacks, breaking through twice, but have not succeeded. The Communist forces' offensive from the south has been the most intense, resulting in daily casualties of up to 20,000 men, with corpses piled up like mountains. The Communist 1st and 2nd Divisions were routed during the attack on the airfield, suffering over 3,000 casualties. The Nationalist 1st and 2nd Security Brigades also suffered extremely heavy losses. The airfield remains under the control of the Nationalists. The air force has provided assistance in the battle, exerting maximum power, causing the invading Communist forces to suffer losses.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] Wang Shuming flew to Nanjing in the afternoon of the 18th. Also, in the bitter fighting at Siping, the Nationalist forces rely on the air force to supply hand grenades.</p>
<p>Nationalist Forces Advance Towards Benxi; Situation Stabilizes in Yingkou Area</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] In the Benxi area, Nationalist forces have launched an offensive around Benxi for the past 48 hours. In a battle near Hualianzhai, northwest of Benxi, over a thousand Communist soldiers were captured, and many were killed or wounded. They continued to press towards Benxi. A unit of Communist forces was discovered southeast of Fushun on the 18th, showing signs of attempting to harass the area. Furthermore, Zheng Dongguo went to inspect the area northwest of Benxi along the Shenyang-Anshan line on the 16th, and returned to Shenyang on the same day, reportedly to arrange for a counter-offensive on Benxi. Reinforcements are also being sent in succession.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] At Dashiqiao on the southern section of the China Changchun Railway, Nationalist forces have withdrawn and are confronting each other at Laobianshan, southwest of the town, on the 18th. Nationalist forces in Haicheng launched an attack on the 18th, with the air force providing assistance. They also plan to repair the bridge between the Fen Shuiba Shan stations, which was destroyed by the Communist forces. The situation in Yingkou stabilized on the 18th, and passenger trains heading south are running to Haicheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] Haicheng reports that after Communist forces from Suinan invaded Gaiping, they divided into two groups on the 16th and advanced towards Dashiqiao (184 kilometers north of Shenyang and 23 kilometers west of Yingkou), the intersection of the China Changchun Railway and the Yingkou branch line. Fierce fighting broke out around Niangniangmiao and Hongqishan, three kilometers southwest of Dashiqiao, at midnight. After inflicting heavy casualties on the invading Communist forces, the Nationalist forces withdrew to new positions at 5:00 AM on the 17th. Before dawn, Communist forces briefly infiltrated Dashiqiao station but were quickly annihilated by the Nationalist forces. Fierce fighting is now taking place in the suburbs of Dashiqiao.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 18th] The Changchun Sweeping Corps engaged in a fierce battle with over 2,000 Communist soldiers at Pingdingshan and Xinkaihe, 20 kilometers south of Changchun, on the morning of the 18th. Fighting was still ongoing at noon. Furthermore, over 2,000 Communist soldiers have infiltrated San Shengyu, northwest of Nongan. Jin Tu is not.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 18th] The Nationalist forces on the Jilin-Changchun Line are facing threats from the southeast and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Communist forces near Tumenling and Bonihezi. The security regiments guarding Huapichang and Yatong River have retreated to Tumenling. A large number of Communist forces have gathered near Yang, attempting to invade Jiutai.</p>
<p>Sweeping Operations on the Jilin-Changchun Line Achieve Victory; Nationalist Forces are Pursuing on Multiple Routes</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] The Communist forces in Wulajie are advancing south very rapidly. Fierce fighting has been taking place for days in the area of Shangxiatongqi, north of Jiuzhan (the second station from Jilin on the Jilin-Changchun Railway line). The Communist forces are using intense firepower to launch fierce attacks south, but our forces are waiting in a position of strength and responding calmly. The Communist forces have suffered heavy casualties, are unable to sustain the attack, and are slowly retreating north. By noon on the 17th, our advance troops had reached the area of Shangxiatongqi, over 20 kilometers north of Jiuzhan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Military Intelligence: According to a comprehensive assessment of recent military activities on both sides of the Jilin-Changchun line, it is evident that the Communist forces intend to cut off traffic between Jilin and Changchun in order to threaten these cities and support Siping. However, the Nationalist forces in Changchun, Jiuhe, and Jilin have long been aware of this and have dispatched sweeping forces to launch attacks on multiple routes in the triangular area south of the Jilin line. The Gu Dianzi station west of Jilin, which was briefly captured by Communist forces on the morning of the 15th, was retaken. The Communist forces then retreated in disarray towards Dahhuangdi. The Nationalist forces attacking from Jiutai swept to the vicinity of Huapichang and engaged in fierce battles with the Communist forces. By the 16th, the Communist forces were unable to sustain the attack and retreated. This unit of Nationalist forces then joined up with the Nationalist forces advancing west from Jilin. Although there was also Communist activity near Tumenling, and the Communist forces in Dahhuangdi were still considering advancing south, the Nationalist sweeping forces have tightly controlled the area. The Nationalist sweeping forces south of the railway line advanced to Chalukou on the morning of the 16th, and the Communist forces scattered and retreated in disarray. The Nationalist forces are currently pursuing on multiple routes.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Forces Launch Counter-Offensive on the Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway; Outcome of the War Situation Expected in Two Weeks; Troops Breaking Through After the Fall of Cangxian Arrive in Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Amidst the swirling smoke of war around Beiping and Tianjin, Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, stated: "The outcome of the war on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway should be clear within two weeks. After the Nationalist reinforcements arrive, the situation on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be turned from danger to safety. He does not believe the Communist forces have any intention of occupying Tianjin, because the Nationalist forces are adopting a strategy of annihilating the main force of the Communist forces, while the Communist forces are avoiding the main force." Tianjin is where the main force of the Nationalist forces is located, and it is believed that the Communist forces would not dare to attempt such a thing. He also judges that the main objectives of the Communist forces' recent disturbances in Hebei province are twofold: (1) to infiltrate major strongholds, and (2) to take the opportunity to expand the "Liberated Areas" along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in preparation for future operations in Shandong. However, he does not believe that the Communist forces will be able to infiltrate the Northeast in the future, because they would have to break through multiple lines of defense, including the Beiping-Tianjin Railway, the eastern section of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway, the Great Wall Line, and the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] After the Nationalist forces launched a counter-offensive on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway yesterday, they made significant progress. By last night, the troops advancing on the front line had retaken Tangguantun after fierce fighting, while another unit bypassed the area and continued south. It is reported that Ye Jianying is directing Communist forces in Liushui Town, more than ten kilometers north of Qingxian. Furthermore, approximately one division of Gao Shuxun's troops is making moves towards Cangxian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] Military Intelligence: On the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Nationalist forces launched an attack on the Communist forces on the 17th, dividing into two routes. One route advanced along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and had reached Zhangguantun, engaging in fierce fighting north of Tangguantun. The other route proceeded south along the Tianjin-Yanshan Highway and, after recapturing Daxiaobozhen, is continuing its advance. Over a hundred wooden boats were discovered at Qikou, a part of Cangxian belonging to Binhai, on the 17th. The area has now become a supply port for materials and ammunition for the Communist forces in Hebei province. Furthermore, fifty wooden boats were discovered at Gaosalingdun, south of Tanggu. Tanggu is stable and safe. Reports that Communist forces had landed near the area are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] It has now been confirmed that Cangxian has been captured by the Communist forces. Over 5,000 armed troops and 3,000-4,000 non-combatants who broke through arrived in Tianjin at 1:30 PM on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] The railway between Yangcun and Beicang, near Tianjin, was damaged last night but was repaired on the morning of the 18th, not hindering military transport. Over 5,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated Yixingbu, fifteen kilometers north of Tianjin, yesterday. The military has been paying close attention.</p>
<p>[Local News] According to China National Aviation Corporation, railway traffic between Beiping and Tianjin has been restored. The company has stopped flying the additional temporary flights starting today.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Eastern Gansu Encircle Huanxian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th] Several thousand Communist soldiers have been besieging the city walls of Huanxian in eastern Gansu for three days and nights. Until noon on the 16th, the Communist forces continued to send reinforcements, launching a fierce attack on the city. The fighting is intense.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong Arrives in Wutai</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 18th] Mao Zedong has arrived in Mount Wutai. The area is under strict guard. Responsible monks and lamas in various temples have been subjected to blood feuds by the Communist Party, resulting in numerous tragic killings. Young people are forced to enlist, and the elderly are expelled. Nuns are also forced to remarry.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jianfei and Others Arrive in Beiping; Will Go to Nanjing Tomorrow to Report on the Situation in Lushun-Dalian</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Zhang Jianfei, Zhu Xinmin, Ye Nan, and three other members of the Lushun-Dalian inspection group arrived in Beiping from Shenyang at 4:00 PM on the 18th. They are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 20th to report to the central government on their inspection. Zhang Jianfei stated that he could not express any opinions before reporting to the central government, and also stated that he had no formal contact with local administrative organizations in Lushun-Dalian. Ye Nan said, "It's always better to see Lushun-Dalian than not to see it." One member of the group jokingly said that the Soviet Union provided them with thorough hospitality and protection. It is reported that after they arrived in Dalian, they were accommodated in the International Friendship Hotel. Soviet warships are docked in Dalian port. No troops were seen in the city, and the police are maintaining order. There are few pedestrians on the streets, but there are many students. However, the market is very depressed. Some buildings are damaged. The city has a population of 600,000.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] Zhang Jianfei flew to Beiping at 1:00 PM on the 18th, transferring to Nanjing to report on the inspection. Ye Nan, Zhu Xinmin, Chen Siyong, Xu Zushan, and others went with him. Dong Yanping canceled his trip due to official business.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] After the return of the Lushun-Dalian inspection group, they avoided revealing any specific information. According to information obtained from the side, the only difficulty encountered by the inspection group was that the Soviet Union invited responsible personnel from the Kwantung Government (which the Nationalist government considers to be a puppet organization), the Dalian and Lushun city governments, and local agencies such as Jin Xian, including Chi Zixiang, Xu Xianqi, Chen Yuntao, and Ren Zhongyi, to participate and give speeches. Chi and others wore formal attire and had smiling faces. Both the speeches and actions were pre-planned. Furthermore, the inspection group also suffered embarrassment when they raised their glasses to celebrate at banquets. Slogans such as "Support Sun Yat-sen's Three Policies of Alliance with Russia" and "Support Sino-Soviet Friendship" were posted in front of the guest house and other places.</p>
<h3>Units for Sale of State-Owned Enterprises Have Been Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] The units of state-owned enterprises to be sold by the government have been decided to be the China Fisheries Corporation, the China Tobacco Company, the China Silk Company, and the China Textile Company (Chunghsing Corporation). 70% of China Textile Company will be sold, and the rest will be sold in their entirety.</p>
<h3>Beitashan Belongs to Our Territory; Moscow's Broadcast of Outer Mongolian Statement is Absolutely Absurd; Director Dong Released a Solemn Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the Beitashan incident, Dong Xian Guang, Director of the News Bureau, issued the following statement on behalf of the government on the 18th: "There is no doubt that the Beitashan area is within the borders of Xinjiang Province and is Chinese territory. Whether before or after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in 1945, Beitashan has been defended by Xinjiang Province. The area has always had a police station and stationed troops established by the Xinjiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>I must solemnly deny the point in the Moscow broadcast that Chinese troops crossed the border of Xinjiang and entered Outer Mongolia. The statement by the Outer Mongolian Foreign Minister broadcast by Moscow is absolutely absurd.</p>
<p>I do not want to say more until I receive a formal reply from Outer Mongolia and the Soviet government. I only want to reiterate that the Beitashan incident is not an ordinary border incident or boundary dispute, but is related to political issues of broader significance."</p>
<h3>U.S. Embassy Denies Pravda's Report</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] The U.S. Embassy denied the Soviet Pravda's report that the Xinjiang incident was instigated by the United States on the 18th. According to Melzer, a news officer at the embassy, the U.S. has "no knowledge of" everything reported by the Soviet newspaper.</p>
<h3>There Are Korean Communists and Japanese Prisoners of War in the Communist Forces; Is This What a Purely Internal War Is Like? A Question at the News Bureau Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] At the regular press conference held by the Executive Yuan News Bureau at 4:30 PM on the 18th, Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, raised three questions, asking Director Dong to answer them. Pan arrived at the venue when the meeting was halfway through and stated that he was participating as a reporter. When Director Dong introduced Pan, he said that he was a former colleague of Deputy Minister Shen of the Central Propaganda Department and is now the speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He then said, "We welcome Speaker Pan to say a few words of goodwill." Pan said, "I am here participating in the capacity of a reporter and have questions to ask Director Dong." Pan continued, "I have just come from Shanghai and saw a printed leaflet titled 'An Authoritative Figure in the Chinese Communist Party Discusses the Current Situation,' with the signature 'Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi, May 30.' What I want to ask is, will the central radio station receive this broadcast? Why can this kind of propaganda be distributed casually here? Its content adds all the phrases of national Qing Dynasty fascism to the government. If it has been received, what attitude should the government take?" When Pan explained, he showed the document to everyone. Dong, after reading it, said that the government has not received this document so far. The best way for the government to deal with this is to ignore it, because once they pay attention to it, they will think that they have gained something. Only by ignoring it will they lose their energy. Dong continued, "In my very quick reading, I believe that this article is not only aimed at the government, but also at stirring up trouble in Sino-American relations." Pan then raised a second question, saying that people generally claim to oppose civil war, and students also say they oppose civil war. We read war reports stating that there are Korean communists and Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist forces in the Northeast, as well as the Beitashan incident. What kind of nature are these incidents? Is this what a purely internal war is like? Dong then read aloud his written statement on the Xinjiang incident (see separate article). Pan then asked a third question, saying, what is the attitude of the United States towards the occurrence of the Xinjiang incident? What is the situation of U.S. aid to China? The United States has agreed to loans to Turkey and Greece, so why is there no result from our country's loans? Dong reiterated his previous response to reporters' inquiries: "The remaining materials from the US$500 million promised by the United States to allow me, by the end of May, only received $20 million worth, a limited number. How much assistance I can get from the United States is obvious. There is no new news regarding the loan." Dong also said, "This is a very 'depressing' matter." Someone asked how the government would respond to the Soviet Union's refusal to allow us to take over Lushun and Dalian? Dong replied, "The government is negotiating. I have no comments to make." Asked whether the government would disclose the truth after the Beitashan incident? Has there been any change in the diplomatic path? The Soviet Union did not reply to our protest. Should we file a complaint with the United Nations? Dong replied, "I have no way to answer."</p>
<p>Situation of Railway Transportation</p>
<p>Xian Guang's Reply to Reporter's Question</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] At the News Bureau press conference on the 18th, a question was asked whether a detailed report could be given comparing the situation of China's transportation lines today with that of ninety days ago.</p>
<p>Director Dong replied: Since the victory, the government has made every effort to restore and maintain important transportation lines. Due to the disturbances and sabotage by the Communist Party and the shortage of materials, this work has been extremely difficult. Destruction is often easy, while construction is difficult. On the 15th, out of 18,097 kilometers of railways nationwide, 10,053 kilometers were open to traffic. Three months ago, 11,468 kilometers were open to traffic. In the past ninety days, the mileage of railways open to traffic in the Northeast has decreased from 3,098 kilometers to 1,858 kilometers due to the impact of the war. During the same period, the Longhai Railway has increased from 1,386 kilometers on March 16 to the current 1,404 kilometers, while the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has increased from 651 kilometers to 671 kilometers. Another noteworthy development is that the 118-kilometer-long Nanxun Railway has been restored to traffic, and the mileage of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway open to traffic has increased from 264 kilometers on March 16 to 422 kilometers on June 15. The comparison of the mileage of railways open to traffic nationwide three months ago and today is listed below:</p>
<p>Comparison of Mileage of Railways Open to Traffic Nationwide Three Months Ago and Currently (in kilometers): (A) Total distance open to traffic on March 16: 11,626, including 3,098 in the Northeast, and (listing only important railways in other areas) 117 on the Jiaoji, 1,050 on the Tianjin-Pukou, 443 on the Beining, 882 on the PingSui, 73 on the Pinggu, 1,386 on the Longhai, 275 on the Zhengtai, 398 on the Tongpu, 339 on the Jinghu, 264 on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, 0 on the Nanxun, and 1,159 on the Yuehan. (The Beining refers to the section within the pass, while the section outside the pass is included in the Northeast item. According to the report on that day, the section within the pass has also been damaged by the Communist forces, and the mileage is unknown). Total distance not open to traffic: 6,317, including 584 in the Northeast, and (listing only important railways in other areas) 338 on the Jiaoji, 478 on the Tianjin-Pukou, 156 on the Pinghan, 190 on the Beining, 320 on the PingSui, 75 on the Pinggu, 210 on the Longhai, 0 on the Zhengtai, 494 on the Tongpu, 3 on the Jinghu, 738 on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, 128 on the Nanxun, and 0 on the Yuehan.

<h3>Ambassador Gu Visits the U.S. Under Secretary of State to Discuss Asian Economic Revival; Negotiations on Sino-American War Debt to Begin Next Week</h3>
<p>[News Report] Washington, 17th: Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, visited U.S. Under Secretary of State Clayton on the afternoon of the 17th to discuss nine-tenths of the Chongqing issue and discuss the problem of reviving Asia. It is proposed to extend the "Marshall Plan for Economic Assistance to Europe" to Asia and propose that China share in the compensation plan for domestic industrial assets in Japan. Start negotiating. Gu said: "Regarding the practical plan of the Chinese government to request the use of the US$500 million loan from the US Export-Import Bank to China, I have informally discussed it with US officials and will formally submit it before the final deadline of June 30. If necessary, China also hopes to extend the deadline."</p>
<p>Suspicion of US$500 Million Loan Being Discussed in Washington</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Our US$500 million construction loan to the United States is currently being discussed in Washington. According to informed sources here, there is a possibility that this loan will succeed this month. It is reported that transportation projects account for one-half of this loan, with the above amount reaching US$275 million, of which railways account for the most, totaling US$214 million. The Ministry of Communications has telegraphed Xiao Qingyun, the representative of the Ministry of Communications of the Chinese Materials Supply Committee in the United States, to assist Gu Weijun in conducting negotiations.</p>
<h3>Starting from All Aspects to Solve the Xinjiang Problem</h3>
<p>Liang Han Cao's Speech in Youth League</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] Liang Hancao stated in a public speech on the afternoon of the 18th that Xinjiang is our territory and we vow to defend it. The people of Xinjiang are our compatriots and we should provide relief. If we can do our best, everything will be easily solved. Liang believes that the Xinjiang incident will not develop much further, and a temporary solution can be expected. However, the problem still exists. To seek a thorough solution, we must work hard in diplomacy, internal affairs, and economics. In terms of diplomacy, since the occurrence of this incident involves international relations, the handling should be solemn. As Mencius said, "Those who serve the small with the great are those who fear Heaven, and those who fear Heaven protect their country." We are currently between the United States and the Soviet Union, and our diplomacy should be neutral and impartial. In terms of internal affairs, the ethnic problems in Xinjiang are complicated. We should grasp the mentality of the new people, enable them to enjoy political democracy, and have full opportunity. What compatriots welcome are engineers, medicine, etc., and no longer welcome the ruling figures of the past frontiers "to show great ambitions." The Central Government should assist local people in defending the country and enable the provincial government to embark on a rational path. Finally, in terms of economy, Xinjiang is extremely rich in resources. According to investigations, the Qitai area contains raw materials for manufacturing atomic bombs. In addition, the oil mines in Wusu are also richer than those in Gansu. We should help the local people engage in construction and accelerate the improvement of people's livelihood. If the above points can be achieved, the relationship between the central government and the local government will not be difficult to become closer every day, and other problems will not be difficult to solve accordingly. Liang once served as the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Headquarters and is very enthusiastic about the new situation in Xinjiang. Today, more than a thousand people who admire his name went to listen to his speech at the Central Corps headquarters.</p>

<h3>Interior Ministry Concerned with Techniques for Universal Suffrage</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Zhang Zeren, a technician from the Internal Affairs Ministry's Population Bureau, spoke to reporters on the 18th about the technical challenges in the universal suffrage process, including ballot production, voting, and vote counting. He stated: Universal suffrage is about to begin. According to statistics, there are two hundred million voters nationwide, so the printing of ballots, the number of ballot boxes, the methods of counting votes, etc., will present difficulties in practical implementation. Now, we are conducting the following research: (1) Regarding ballot production, the total number of voters in the twelve special municipalities nationwide is approximately six million or more, requiring 1,200 ballot boxes. The production of these eight million-plus ballots and 1,200 ballot boxes must be planned and managed by the General Election Office, and then provided to the municipal election offices for use. The National Assembly ballots for each county and city bureau should be produced and distributed by the provincial election offices, and must be stamped with the official seal or chop of the provincial office according to regulations. We generally plan to have the provincial offices assign personnel in shifts day and night to stamp the ballots at the fastest possible speed, stamping sixty sheets per minute, or more than sixty thousand sheets per day. Considering that Sichuan Province alone has twenty million ballots, this would require more than three hundred days, which is practically impossible. Therefore, from a practical point of view, we propose that each unit handle the printing separately, with the election offices sending personnel to supervise. (2) Regarding voting, regulations stipulate that voting must be completed within three days. The prescribed ballot box style is rectangular, one foot eight inches high, two feet two inches long, and one foot four inches wide, capable of holding five thousand ballots. Regarding the issues of voting dates and ballot box capacity limitations, we propose that the size of each district, that is, the number of voters under each polling station, should be standardized at five thousand people. It can be agreed that in urban areas, two or three bao form a district; in large townships, one township forms a district; and in small townships, two townships form a district, with one polling station set up in each district. (3) Regarding vote counting, general estimates are that National Assembly legislators and committee members with more votes may receive one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand or more votes. Such large numbers are difficult to calculate. Universal suffrage counting uses the "正" character [a tally mark system], but this number is too large, and the "正" character is not easy to use. Therefore, it is proposed that the names of the candidates be pre-labeled on each ballot box, and then the ballots be counted in bundles of one thousand to simplify the process.</p>
<h3>Authorities Have Not Decided on Reconstruction of the National Assembly Hall</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the reconstruction of the National Assembly Hall, personnel from both the Executive Yuan and internal departments are currently in discussion. It is reported that the current standard is to accommodate three thousand seats. According to Hong Lanyou, told reporters, the quota of three thousand representatives should prepare 4,500 seats, because the imperial hearing by the guests, the seats of the general meeting staff and journalists must be considered.</p>
<h3>Central Political Committee Discusses the Current Situation, Various Members Offer Major Policy Suggestions, Recommend Sun and Chen to Submit to the President for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The current situation is approaching a critical stage, and people from all walks of life are paying close attention. In the Central Political Committee meeting held on the morning of the 18th, a heated discussion was held, and the members agreed that major policy decisions were necessary. Opinions were offered one after another. As a result, Sun and Chen Lifu were recommended to submit these opinions to the President immediately, and another extraordinary meeting will be convened in the near future to specifically discuss this issue. There were many speakers during the discussion on the 18th, even Niu Yongjian, who is usually very prudent, stood up and spoke, saying: The overall situation is extremely serious, and a decision should be made immediately. The general view of the other committee members who spoke was that the Communist Party has rejected peace talks and is hostile to the current National Government. Judging from various signs in the war, it is indeed involved in international background. The Central Government must consider all the circumstances before making a major decision because the situation is serious and cannot be delayed any longer. Military and diplomatic measures should be taken simultaneously, and it is not appropriate to remain passive, so that both domestic and foreign countries can have a clearer understanding of the current situation. In reality, the situation in Northeast and Northwest China shows that the Communist army's operations have the appearance of an international war. Our country should make a decision for the sake of the nation, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, but the world, especially the United States, should face the reality. President Truman's policy should not differentiate between Europe and the Far East. The discussion on the 18th lasted a very long time. In the end, because the President did not attend and no conclusion could be reached, Sun and Chen were recommended to submit the matter to the President for approval, and then an extraordinary meeting will be convened for discussion. Some of the committee members who attended believed that the meeting on the 18th was very fruitful and meaningful, demonstrating their concern for national affairs.</p>
<p>Universal Suffrage Party Nomination Methods Decided to Submit to the State Council for Discussion</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Central Political Committee held a routine meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th, chaired by Sun Ke. First, Foreign Minister Wang reported on the handling of the Xinjiang incident and the diplomatic negotiations, and also discussed the war situation. Then, Ma Chaojun, Minister of Agriculture and Industry, who had recently returned to Nanjing from the Northeast, reported on his observations in the Northeast. Then, the current situation was discussed, and several proposals were passed and personnel appointments were finalized. The main points are listed below: (1) Methods for party nomination in elections. (2) The number of legislators for industrial and professional groups is expected to be submitted to the State Council for consideration, requesting an increase to 110, because the 56 approved by the Legislative Yuan are insufficient for distribution among the occupational groups. (3) The Education Professional Committee proposed preliminary principles for reforming secondary education. Regarding personnel changes, (1) the candidates for mayor of the four special municipalities of Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Shenyang were finalized. Except for Wang Youzhi, who is proposed to be transferred from the mayor of Xi'an to the director of the Department of Education of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, the mayors of the other three cities are not expected to change. (2) It was decided that Wu Tiecheng would succeed as the vice president of the Legislative Yuan. (3) It was decided that Yuan Da would be appointed as the ambassador to Greece. (4) It was decided that Xu Jizhuang would be appointed as a legislator. (5) It was decided that Xing Jihui would be appointed as a supervisor. The above personnel changes are subject to review and discussion by the State Council before a decision is made.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the methods for party nomination in the universal suffrage, the Central Political Committee discussed this on the 18th and decided to submit it to the State Council. The proposed method is to limit it to the three parties participating in the government. Parties other than the three parties, if they participate in the election, will follow the general provisions of the election law. As for how to recognize political parties after the implementation of the constitution, the executive branch will refer to national examples to determine.</p>

<h3>Regulations of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Agreed Upon, Plenary Session of the Committee to Be Held Today, Next General Assembly Scheduled for July 10th in New York</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The first General Assembly of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East was held for the third day yesterday. The fifth meeting was held at 10:30 a.m., and the sixth meeting was held at 2:30 p.m., both chaired by Dr. Jiang Tingfu. After passing the provisional agenda, it was decided that the Plenary Committee of the conference will be held at Lake Success in New York on July 10th. It was also decided that the Plenary Subcommittee will begin today to specifically discuss Section 2 of Part 2 of the United Nations Economic and Social Council resolution of March 28th, which states: "The meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East shall be responsible for collecting more information on economic recovery and investigating it. If necessary, it shall also conduct on-site inspections, and then provide a report on the results of the investigation to the next General Assembly of the Council."</p>
<p>When representatives from various countries discussed the above issues, it caused a heated debate, especially the Soviet representative Shidexin Ke spoke a lot.</p>
<p>The formal work of the General Assembly has only just begun today. The discussions in the past three days have all been about formalities and regulations. Now that the regulations have been agreed upon yesterday, it can officially begin its heavy tasks today.</p>
<p>The details of yesterday's meeting are recorded in detail below:</p>
<h3>Discussing the Provisional Agenda, A Heated Debate, Morning Meeting Fails to Reach a Result</h3>
<p>Chairman Jiang Yanfu raised the fifth item on the agenda, "Discussing the Provisional Agenda," when the meeting opened yesterday morning. Indian representative Nehru immediately suggested that the following three points should be included in this item: (1) Membership and organization of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, (2) Changes or additions to the regional scope, and (3) The temporary headquarters of the committee (the above three points have been stipulated by the United Nations Economic and Social Council to be discussed by the Plenary Committee at its meeting in New York).</p>
<p>Nehru's suggestion aroused different opinions in the General Assembly, which differed for a long time. After Mr. Nai stated his views, Mr. Wo Wen replied that the issue of the headquarters could be discussed in three situations: (1) The headquarters of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will be the headquarters of the United Nations Far East Office, which must be decided by the United Nations General Assembly. (2) Before 1948, the temporary headquarters could be decided by this conference (referring to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East); (3) Before a decision is made, the temporary headquarters of the Secretariat of this conference will be in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Shidexin Ke agreed with Mr. Nai's suggestion that three items should be added to the temporary agenda: (1) Membership, (2) Regional scope, and (3) The duties of this conference.</p>
<p>Australian representative Wu Dengfa asked: If an issue has been decided to be discussed by the Plenary Committee, can this conference also discuss it?</p>
<p>British representative Crowe said: This conference was produced by the Economic and Social Council, so it should be restricted by the resolutions of the council.</p>
<p>Shidexin Ke also asked: If the Plenary Committee held in New York was produced by this conference, why should its affairs be reported directly to the Economic and Social Council?</p>
<p>American representative Pei Davis said: This delegation is not prepared to discuss the issues raised by the Soviet representative. He believes that if it must be discussed, it will violate the instructions of the organizational body of this conference, so he proposed to pass the original temporary agenda.</p>
<p>Shi expressed his disagreement, citing the documents he received and reciting one point in it: "The Economic and Social Council requests this conference to discuss this issue."</p>
<p>Chinese representative Li Gan, in order to ease the atmosphere between the two sides, said: The point that this conference was produced by the Economic and Social Council need not be repeated, so this conference does not seem to exceed the scope of the agenda currently set by the general agency. He also endorsed the opinions of both parties, suggesting that the original agenda be adopted, but the opinions of the Indian and Soviet representatives can also be expressed during the agenda, so as to provide a reference for the future Plenary Committee in New York.</p>
<p>Indian representative Nehru then agreed to pass the agenda, but did not advocate discussing item 6: the establishment of the Plenary Committee.</p>
<p>Davis explained that his suggestion did not mean that other representatives could not express their opinions, but the US delegation was not prepared to discuss the three issues raised by the Soviet representative, because the agenda did not stipulate that there should be decisive measures or resolutions on this issue.</p>
<p>At this point, the chairman said: The Indian representative wants to amend the agenda and cancel the sixth item: "Establishing a Plenary Committee." I suggest that the Indian representative may propose to change the nature or organization of the Plenary Committee when discussing the sixth item, and at the same time, he can propose specific instructions. As far as I know, although this conference is restricted by the resolutions of the Economic and Social Council, the resolution cannot prevent us from giving instructions to the subordinate institutions of this conference.</p>
<p>French representative Moore No said; There seems to be some misunderstanding in the opinions of the representatives, and we should not have any misunderstandings, so he advocated adjourning the meeting and waiting for further discussion in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The chairman put the adjournment to a vote. The four representatives of India, the Soviet Union, and France supported it, while the three representatives of Liberia, the United States, and the Philippines opposed it. They were asked to adjourn the meeting under the principle of "minority obeying the majority." The meeting was originally scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. British representative Crowe suggested that the case should be concluded as soon as possible, and suggested holding it at 2:30 p.m., which was passed.</p>
<p>Suggestions from Indian and Soviet Representatives The vote was not passed Siam's representatives voted twice in abstention</p>
<p>The agenda issue continued to be discussed in the afternoon, and Stretenski formally proposed to add the three points he proposed to the agenda. Neru seconded. After being put to a vote, only two representatives from India and the Soviet Union voted in favor, and eight representatives from China, Britain, the United States, Australia, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Siam voted against, which was not passed. The Indian representative's proposal to cancel the "Establishment of a Plenary Committee" was voted again, and the result was also rejected by two votes (India and the Soviet Union) to seven (the representative of Siam abstained). British representative Crowe immediately proposed to pass the "Establishment of a Plenary Committee," and Philippine representative Vice Chairman Guaxian asked to second the motion, which was passed by seven votes to two (India and the Soviet Union) (the Siam representative abstained again).</p>
<p>When the Chairman continued to put the seventh item of the agenda to discuss the resolution of the Economic and Social Council, Shteltsenkov asked: If one or several representatives abandon their participation in the plenary committee, will the plenary committee still have its full power? The principal responded by saying: This is a matter of organizational law and legal matters, and I am not in a position to answer. He then asked Wo Wen to explain, and Wo Wen said: The agenda of the plenary committee should be restricted by the rules of procedure of this meeting. All meetings should be open unless this meeting decides not to open them.</p>
<p>Then, the date of the Plenary Committee meeting in Success Lake, New York was discussed. The date was originally scheduled to be held on July 7 this year. Later, the Indian representative proposed that it would be too late to go to New York to participate after this meeting ended, so he advocated a delay of a few days. Later, Wo Wen proposed on July 10th, and the British representative first agreed to set it on the 7th, and then also agreed on the 10th, so it was decided to be held on July 10th.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Plenary Subcommittee</p>
<p>A proposal from an American representative was passed</p>
<p>Then, American representative Davis proposed to form the committee (that is, Asia Feng Economic Association) into a plenary subcommittee in order to discuss the various issues included in the seventh item. This proposal was endorsed by the Philippine representative.</p>
<p>Stretenski immediately stated: He could not understand the scope of discussion and enforcement mechanisms of the plenary subcommittee. The chairman immediately replied: If the US representative's proposal can be passed, then the committee will be able to start discussing the issues raised by the Soviet representative. Wo Wen also said: All measures of this meeting, and the manner of enforcement, must be decided by this committee itself.</p>
<p>Some representatives could not understand the difference between the Plenary Committee held in New York and the Plenary Committee held in Shanghai, and asked questions for a while. Wo Wen suggested: In order to facilitate the distinction between the two Plenary Committees, the Committee in New York should be called the "First Plenary Committee," and the Plenary Committee in Shanghai should be called the "Second Plenary Committee."</p>
<p>The Chairman then put the US representative's proposal to a vote, which was immediately passed unanimously, and the conference adjourned at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>The difference between the two Plenary Committees</h3>
<p>The so-called "First Plenary Committee" is scheduled to be held at Success Lake on July 10th to discuss the membership, regional scope, and changes or increases in the scope of iron affairs of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The results of the meeting should be reported to the Economic and Social Council. The delegation of the committee is still the ten countries that are now attending the meeting, and representatives can be appointed by each country separately. The candidates for chairman will be elected at the time of the meeting.</p>
<p>As for the Second Plenary Committee, that is, the Plenary Subcommittee, it will be held at 10:30 a.m. this morning to study and discuss Section 2 of Part 2 of the Economic and Social Council's resolution (the content has been explained above). Its representatives are still the full representatives of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The main purpose is that the subcommittee can freely express their opinions, and the discussion of issues is also broader. However, after the various issues to be discussed in item 7 of the agenda are concluded, the plenary subcommittee will be restored to the original committee meeting.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the Japanese Provisional Compensation Plan, Allied Headquarters Has Drafted a List, the United States Will Propose a New Plan, China Has Not Received Notification</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] According to top sources: The work of the Allied Headquarters on the 30% provisional compensation plan is ready, and it is waiting for the order of the Washington Far East Commission. After careful study, the Allied Headquarters has drafted a "list of suitable materials" for the 30% provisional compensation, which is sufficient to ensure that countries that have not participated in the initial compensation plan will not be affected in the end. Headquarters officials are eager to implement the compensation plan, as it is closely related to the recovery of Japan's foreign trade. Unless the compensation issue is resolved at least in part, recent efforts to restore Japan's foreign trade will be virtually futile.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 18th] According to reports, the United States will propose a new Japanese compensation plan, which will greatly ease restrictions on Japan's future industry. The reporter inquired about this to the person in charge of the Compensation Committee, and was told: To date, we have not received any official documents regarding this news. According to reliable sources: If this case is really proposed, we will definitely argue based on reason.</p>

<h3>Nanchang-Xunyang Railway Line Trial Run Yesterday, Operations to Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 18th] The Nanchang-Xunyang line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway underwent a trial run on the 18th. Due to the completion of the track restoration work amidst various difficulties and the rudimentary nature of the facilities, there are currently no passenger cars on the line. Passengers stand in enemy trucks, swaying as they travel. The Xiang-produced railway sleepers are not of sufficient dimensions, and although more are being added, they are still inadequate for the load. The sleepers creaked loudly during the trial run, and the train did not dare to travel quickly when crossing bridges, resulting in a very slow speed of only about ten kilometers per hour. The line is scheduled to begin operations on July 1st, with a formal opening ceremony to be held on July 7th. According to the Engineering Department, the track laying progress reached 5.48 on June 15th, setting a new post-war railway restoration record.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Hangzhou</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Submit Memorandum Requesting Inclusion of Anti-Chinese Issues on Agenda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] Chinese merchants here have recently submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Far East Economic Commission in Shanghai, requesting that the anti-Chinese trends in the Philippines and market issues over the years be included on the agenda. They believe that the Far East Economic Commission should take appropriate measures to persuade Philippine leaders to curb the general anti-Chinese trends and, in particular, repeal the Public Market Stall Act. The memorandum lists various legislative proposals and administrative measures by the Philippine government that are clearly directed against foreign nationals (in reality, mainly anti-Chinese), the most hateful of which is Bill No. 37, the basic purpose of which is to eliminate the vested legal occupations of overseas Chinese. The memorandum also states that an anti-Chinese alliance has been organized in the Philippines, led by Sator, whose purpose is to expel all overseas Chinese from the Philippines.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Anti-Chinese sentiment in the Philippines has taken a new turn. More than 1,000 overseas Chinese on Samar Island have recently received warning letters signed by Mangochai, ordering them to cease all business operations. Mangochai claims to be the leader of an anti-Chinese retired veterans organization. Overseas Chinese here have urgently sent representatives to the Chinese Consulate in the Philippines to report the activities of this new organization and express their deep concern that if this anti-Chinese trend is not stopped in time, it will lead to adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Facing the Essence of "Internal Disorder"</h3>
<p>Amid the calls for peace from the people of the whole country, we have seen the Chinese Communists' rejection of the peace appeals made by the Political Consultative Conference, dismissing the Conference as a "tool of the government" and denying its representation of popular will in its peace appeals. This newspaper has previously commented that peace is a unanimous appeal of the people, and also the consistent policy of the government. The reason why peace has not been achieved lies in the attitude of the Communist Party. We cited a dispatch from Nanjing by a United Press reporter: "The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communists is one-party dictatorship, rather than multi-party participation in government, which is the same as the Soviet political system in various parts of the world. Under these circumstances, achieving peace will not be easy." Now, the war is unfolding fiercely in various parts of the country: in the Northeast, in southern Shandong, in Tianjin-Qinhuangdao, in various parts of North China, and even as far as Gansu in the Northwest and Guangdong and Fujian in the Southeast, the Chinese Communists are engaging in destructive activities against unity, revival, and construction. Under these circumstances, the National Army cannot sit idly by and await death, but must resist. Therefore, nearly two years after the victorious end of the war against Japan, there is still a state of war in various parts of the country. To this day, the government is still seeking peace, while the Chinese Communists are expanding their power by force, step by step, without ceasing. Is this not a mockery of calls for peace? Don't look at other things. US troops were originally stationed in Tianjin-Qinhuangdao. Recently, after the US troops withdrew in batches, the Chinese Communists used force to coerce them, so that the road traffic between Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Beiping is on the verge of being cut off, and the disaster of war is about to return. Who created this situation? Is it not clearly created by the Chinese Communists? The people of the whole country are concerned about the situation in the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao area. They understand that the current situation in the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao area is entirely due to the Chinese Communists' attempt to take advantage of the US troop withdrawal to gain a favorable position, which the National Army has to counter. From this example, we can see that the reason why the domestic war is ongoing is precisely because the Chinese Communists believe in force.</p>
<p>What we want to point out here is that this is by no means a situation of "civil war." The "Civil War" that occurred in the United States during the time of President Lincoln was not like this; even the Spanish "Civil War" during the time of Franco was different. To say that this is a "civil war" is to insult the people of the whole country, because peace is the hope of the people of the whole country, and the government has never abandoned the desire for peace. The people and the government do not want war, and the reason why war has not been avoided is that the Chinese Communists believe in force, trying to subvert the current government and complete their ambition to seize power. This constitutes "internal disorder," which the government should order to suppress in order to uphold law and order. However, even saying it is "internal disorder" is problematic. The "disorder" occurring in the country today is no longer purely "internal disorder," but is actually a collusion between internal and external forces, with an international character. Today, there are officers and soldiers who once belonged to the Japanese "Imperial Army" in the armed forces of the Chinese Communists, and in the Northeast, there are armed forces of the North Korean people fighting alongside the Chinese Communist forces. Is this not clearly an international war? And at this time, the Soviet-Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang in our country, echoing the Communist military actions in the Northeast, North China, and other places, which is obviously a planned act of rebellion, mobilizing international forces and violating the wishes of the people of the whole country for peace? Therefore, we must clarify the essence of the "internal disorder" occurring in China. This is a recognition that the people of the whole country must have.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Communists have colluded with foreign forces and openly rebelled, what is the difference between their actions and those of the traitors like Wang Jingwei? The people of the whole country can distinguish right from wrong, and they have their own opinions on the actions of those who betray national interests; we do not need to point out more here. However, there are a few points that we cannot but point out here:</p>
<p>First, what the Communist Party is doing in China violates the will of the people of the whole country and is abandoned by the people of the whole country. It has also mobilized international forces, giving the turmoil in China a strong international color. We firmly believe that our government will be able to handle this situation well. We regret that when the domestic situation has not yet stabilized and order has not been restored, the US troops stationed in China have already withdrawn, while the Soviet Union still has heavy troops stationed in our Northeast. Now that the war against Japan has ended, we hope that the Soviet Union's troops stationed in our Northeast can also withdraw quickly.</p>
<p>Second, since the turbulent situation in China has an international meaning, our neighboring countries can no longer take a bystander's attitude, as if they were not involved; they should actively and more clearly express their attitude. Although the situation in Europe is worrying, the situation in Asia is even more worrying. We should not forget that the Second World War did not occur in Munich, but in Shenyang, China. The Truman Doctrine and Marshall's statement should include Asia, and should focus on Asia. The development of the situation in China to the present stage is occupying an important factor in international relations, and we should not ignore this point.</p>
<p>Third, we had the slogan of fighting the war and building the country during the war. Now that the war of resistance has ended victoriously, although there is the rebellion of the Communist Party, we should actively launch our work of reviving and building the country. Seeking construction in destruction, seeking stability in turmoil, this is our slogan during the war, and it is also our slogan now. Therefore, we hope that the government can take into account construction while facing the war. After a long period of war, the national economy of our country has been riddled with holes. Even if it is not possible to completely cure the root cause at this time, we should also urgently seek treatment, hoping to gradually recover. When the economic situation improves slightly, the mood of the people will also inevitably increase. Military, political, and economic, these three are inseparable. The rebellion of the Communist Party is comprehensive, and we must also use comprehensive operations to deal with them.</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain for Over a Month in Taiwan, Rice Spikes Damaged, Bridges and Embankments Washed Away, Sun Moon Lake Power Transmission to Northern Taiwan Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 17th] Taiwan Province has experienced incessant heavy rain for over a month. The rice spikes in the south have suffered significant damage. It is reported that some of the rice grains in Kaohsiung have begun to germinate. Sugarcane, a major product of Tainan and Chiayi, has also begun to rot. In the north, the rice planting season is delayed. According to the Hsinchu County Government after inspecting more than 40 townships, the impact is still minimal. However, if the rain continues, the future of the food supply is also quite concerning. Excessive water accumulation in the mountains has caused dramatic downstream flow, resulting in the collapse of iron towers near Miaoli. Power transmission from Sun Moon Lake to northern Taiwan has been temporarily suspended, and thermal power generation is being used as a substitute. The Dazhuoshui Bridge in the east has also suffered damage, and parts of the highway there have also been damaged. Although repairs have been completed, passengers still need to walk across the bridge and change vehicles at Dazhuoshui Bridge. Regarding embankments, according to urgent repair reports received by the Public Works Bureau, there are more than 20 embankment failures in Hsinchu, Houlong River, Tainan, Beiwei, Taitung, Beinan, Daxi, and Taichung County. The damage in Wufeng is the most severe, with repair costs estimated at 26 million yuan. Regarding railways, the railway bridge near Changhua North and Zhuifen has been damaged, and night trains have been suspended. The Provincial Government has specifically formulated key points for flood season rescue and embankment engineering, and has telegraphed various counties and cities to take strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Agricultural Situation in Sichuan Province, Rice Prices Falling in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chengdu, 18th] Rice prices in Sichuan Province have generally risen sharply, especially in Chengdu. Recently, due to the dispatch of Security and Food Inspection Teams to various districts to investigate hoarding and grain speculation, and due to the optimistic spring planting situation, prices in various places have begun to fall on the 17th. The Provincial Government has strictly ordered the 16 counties near Chengdu to supply 4,000 piculs of rice to Chengdu daily, starting from the 17th. The Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters previously inspected 10,000 piculs of national grain in Chengdu City and began to stabilize prices. On the 17th, the price of rice in Chengdu was 170,000 yuan per picul. According to the Provincial Grain Office, the agricultural situation in Sichuan is optimistic, and there should be no problem in shipping 50,000 tons of rice to Shanghai every month.</p>

<h3>Retrial of Arch-Traitor Yin Rugeng, Beijing High Court Reopens</h3>
<p>Yin's Defense of Treasonous Acts Reveals Further Deceit</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] After the case of the old-time traitor Yin Rugeng was remanded for retrial, the Beijing High Court reopened for a second trial at 10:30 AM on the 18th, presided over by Presiding Judge Lu Yunxie. Yin appeared in a blue silk gown, holding a paper fan. He frequently fanned himself while defending his treasonous acts, revealing further deceit. Yin continued to make excuses for the Xianghe Incident of that year, and exaggerated his efforts to rescue underground workers, frequently mentioning words such as "nation" and "people," which was sickening to hear. His defense lawyer, Zhang Wenbo, and lawyers in Hangzhou and other places then made arguments on his behalf, presenting favorable evidence and stating that Yin did not "seize national territory" and had connections with the Central Government. The court adjourned for investigation at 11:40 AM, and a new debate session will be scheduled.</p>

<h3>Britain and France Reach Agreement to Establish European Economic Commission, to Invite Soviet Union to Participate in Work, to Implement Tasks within United Nations Framework</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 18th Broadcast: Britain and France agreed today to establish a European Economic Commission within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission, in order to implement the Marshall Plan for economic assistance to Europe. A French government spokesman claimed that Britain and France will jointly invite the Soviet Union to participate in the work of the Commission. According to the current British-French agreement, it was facilitated by Bidault and Bevin, and the French cabinet immediately approved it. According to French sources, the establishment of this European Commission is based on the French plan, stipulating that reconstruction work be handled by specialized committees, but all work will be carried out within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission. The United Nations Economic Commission is actually a design institution, while the new commission is an executive institution.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] French Foreign Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin held their second meeting this morning. After the Anglo-French talks ended, Bidault will go to London to approve the Anglo-French Treaty and continue discussions on the US economic plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] French Prime Minister Ramadier, Foreign Minister Bidault, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and economic advisors from both sides engaged in initial contact at a banquet at the British Embassy tonight to determine concrete steps for Europe to respond to the Marshall Plan. After Bevin and his experts arrived at the British Embassy, ​​they joined their embassy colleagues to study a memorandum provided by Alphonse, Director of the Economic Division of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content of the document is the same as announced by Alphonse last night. The main points are to suggest the establishment of four committees to study Europe's needs and capabilities in coal, steel, transportation and agriculture. Bevin and Ramadier's difficulties tonight were whether to start consultations immediately on a smaller scale, or to avoid exclusive negotiations for political reasons to prevent being regarded by others as a "Western economic bloc". Moscow has criticized the Marshall Plan as transplanting the disguised Truman anti-communism in the economic aspect. Before Moscow expresses its formal opinion, the Anglo-French talks cannot but be extra cautious. In the Paris talks today and tomorrow, British and French representatives should reach a resolution on all or part of the following questions: (1) Will the pan-European economic design under the Marshall Plan start from a restrictive Western European foundation to develop eastward, or will it wait for most European countries to express their agreement before holding a meeting to discuss the reconstruction policy? (2) If it is decided to adopt the latter approach mentioned above, how will the meeting be convened and who will draft the agenda? (3) If the Soviet Union refuses to participate in the common European economic design under the Marshall Plan, will Britain and France continue to launch a common design in the rest of Europe? If so, will Eastern European countries within the Soviet sphere of influence participate? (4) How can the economic design under the Marshall Plan cooperate with the economic design of Germany, and who will represent Germany to participate in the design institution? Some British and American officials feel that although this matter is expected to progress rapidly, observers can only take instructions at any time and cannot immediately expect its results. However, observers believe that Bevin and Ramadier should at least decide that the discussion of a common European economic design will be based on the entirety of Europe west of Asia, or will start with Western Europe first, but keep the door open for the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to participate later.</p>
<h3>Bevin Instructs Peterson to Ask if the Soviet Union Accepts US Aid Plan, Soviet Union Denies Molotov's Visit to France</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to Paris by plane today. A few hours before his departure, he re-instructed British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Peterson to ask Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov whether the Soviet government intends to accept the United States' proposed plan to provide economic assistance to Europe. Although Pravda published an article opposing the European economic recovery plan proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall, and it is said that this plan has caused a bad impression among Soviet officials, the British government does not admit that this is a definite rejection of the US proposal by the Soviet government. In addition, Foreign Secretary Bevin also instructed Ambassador Peterson to ask the Soviet government to explain the dismissal of former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy. It is reported that the British government previously requested the Soviet Union to provide information on this matter, which was rejected by the Soviet government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Insco, 17th] There have been rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Paris. Diplomatic circles here expressed surprise upon hearing the news, saying that Pravda has already commented on Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European economic recovery, expressing absolute disapproval. Therefore, it is impossible for the Soviet Union to send Foreign Minister Molotov to Paris to discuss this plan.</p>
<h3>French President Praises Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] French President Auriol recently gave a speech at a banquet held by the Foreign Press Association today, praising Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan. He briefly stated: There is no time for hesitation at the moment. The French government welcomes Secretary of State Marshall's bold and wise plan, which is a ray of dawn on the road of life. We need to move forward bravely immediately, without any further delay. France expresses its agreement with international economic and political cooperation. This is not the time for hesitation, suspicion, or argument. Our ancient continent should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Another Soviet Hint Regarding US Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>Advocating Management by UN Agencies</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] A Moscow broadcast last night stated that the Soviet Union will not encourage any new attempts to assess Europe's economic needs. The broadcast, reiterating the Pravda's criticism of the Marshall Plan for European Aid the day before, also stated that the plan is an interference in the economic affairs of other countries. It believes that the current task is not to collect information on the economic needs of various countries, but to address these needs under the principles of international cooperation in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. This Moscow broadcast hints that the Soviet Union may be more willing to accept the Marshall Plan for European Aid if it can be implemented through the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe instead of establishing separate agencies. This hint may have some impact on Bevin's negotiations in Paris.</p>
<h3>Norway, Sweden, and Denmark to Confer on European Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Danish Capital, 18th] The foreign ministers of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are scheduled to meet here on August 27 to discuss the American plan for the reconstruction of Europe.</p>
<h3>Netherlands and Belgium to Notify US in Support of US Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Diplomats from the Netherlands and Belgium recently told this news agency's reporter that the diplomatic envoys of the Netherlands and Belgium to the United States will submit identical notes to the State Department tomorrow, expressing their enthusiastic support for Secretary of State Marshall's European economic plan, and guaranteeing that the Netherlands and Belgium will give full cooperation. This is the result of a consensus reached after talks between the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and the above-mentioned note was drafted accordingly.</p>
<h3>World Bank Resolves to Assist Countries with Construction</h3>
<p>[United States New Opening Office, Washington, 17th] Mr. Binio, Director of the Lending Department of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, told the Columbia Business Promotion Association today that the prosperity of the United States depends on the soundness of the world economy. The soundness of the world economy can be guided by the International Bank formulating plans, enhancing mutual assistance among member states, and engaging in domestic construction and development, thereby guiding it. Mr. Bi continued: The total amount of loans currently held by the bank has reached 2.554 billion US dollars. The bank will decide on applications for loans based on the following facts: whether the loan is urgent and useful; whether the loan is beneficial to the borrower and world trade; whether the borrower is willing and able to utilize its own resources to the greatest extent; whether the loan can meet the borrower's ; whether the borrower has the ability to maintain the terms of the loan, etc. Loans can only be granted after member states submit implementation plans and have appropriate guarantees.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Negotiations on Clearing Lend-Lease Debt Stalled</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on clearing lend-lease debts, diplomatic sources here said that the negotiations have been stalled due to difficulties encountered by the Soviet Union in drawing up a list of lend-lease materials. The Soviet Union cannot provide the US authorities with a detailed list of equipment provided by the United States during the war.</p>
<h3>Italian President's Resignation Withdrawn; Italy Expresses Willingness to Support Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th Radio: Nicola, the interim president of the Italian Republic, expressed his intention to resign yesterday, citing physical exhaustion, but has decided to withdraw his resignation due to the earnest retention of Prime Minister Gasperi.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 17th] President Nicola's announcement today of his firm decision to resign has greatly stirred up the Italian political situation. It is understood that all parties are making efforts to retain Mr. Nicola, because there is currently no legal or parliamentary mechanism for appointing an interim president. President Nicola is 69 years old and is believed to be suffering from nervous fatigue and in urgent need of rest. He had previously announced his resignation on June 24, the original date for the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. Recently, the Constituent Assembly has been extended to November 31, and the general election has also been changed to the New Year next year. Nicola was elected president by an overwhelming majority by the Constituent Assembly on June 28, 1946. It is reported that Gasperi Delley has told President Nicola that if he is in poor health, he can take a long vacation, but in any case, he should be asked to continue serving until the end of the Constituent Assembly. As for the left-wing parties, they are deeply gratified by President Nicola's firm intention to resign. They believe that Mr. Nicola's resignation may not be due to personal health reasons, but to a lack of trust in the current government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Italian Ambassador Tagliani formally informed US Undersecretary of State Clayton today that Italy will fully support Secretary of State Marshall's announced aid to Europe plan. Tae also told reporters, "Italy will do its best to cooperate with other European countries and respond to the Marshall Plan. I have informed Clayton of this intention."</p>
<p>Italian Communist Party Turns Course</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 17th] Former Italian Communist Party Finance Minister Scimarolo and several economic experts from the party gave speeches to the Italian Parliament last night, officially stating that Italy's finances depend on the United States, and that Italy is in urgent need of foreign loans, which only the United States can provide. The Italian Communist Party's current attitude of supporting borrowing from the United States can be regarded as an action to break away from the international communist line, but Scimarolo's speech also shows that there are sharp differences between the Italian Communist Party and the Kremlin's policies. For example, the Italian Communist Party fully supports the incorporation of Trieste into Italy, while the Kremlin advocates ceding it to Yugoslavia in international conferences.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Bank Shares Partially Transferred to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hungarian Capital, 17th] It is learned that the Soviet Union has reached an agreement with the Hungarian authorities stipulating that the shares in the Hungarian Loan Bank that are considered German foreign capital and should belong to the Soviet Union according to the Potsdam Agreement will be transferred to the Soviet Union. Most of the bank's shares were owned by the French Rothschild family before the war, but were acquired by Germany after France's defeat. According to the Soviet-Hungarian agreement, 35% of the shares will belong to the Soviet Union, and the remainder will continue to be held by private shareholders until the issue of private ownership of the bank is resolved. At the same time, negotiations between the Hungarian Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade in Moscow on financial and commercial relations between the two countries seem to have reached a deadlock. The Hungarian Minister of Finance is scheduled to return home next week for instructions, and will return to Moscow after completing his official duties.</p>
<h3>Former Prime Minister Nagy Expresses Intention to Form Hungarian Government in Exile; Hopes US Will Take Further Action to Prevent Deterioration of European Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy told the American press here today that if Britain and the United States can recognize the Hungarian government in exile, he can prepare to organize such a government, but he said that this government may not be located in the United States. Mr. Na also said, I have a plan to resolve the entire Hungarian situation, but I do not intend to discuss it until I have contacted State Department officials. I intend to be the spokesperson for my unfortunate people, so that the world can know the truth about Hungary and other European countries. Mr. Na also denounced the Soviet General Svelidov, chairman of the Allied Control Commission in the Hungarian capital, for saying that the new Hungarian government had obtained the consent of the people as nonsense, and recognized the Soviet Union's rejection of the American protest as another milestone on the Soviet road to defeat. He also believes that to prevent the European situation from further deteriorating, action is needed that is even greater than resistance to the machine. When asked what kind of action he hoped Britain and the United States would take, he said that he did not intend to comment on this point until he had consulted with the State Department. Mr. Na will visit various dignitaries tomorrow and meet with Marshall at the State Department. It is hoped that he will be received by President Truman this week.</p>
<p>Hungarian People Lose Freedom</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy said to the press here today: Soviet police will use the most inhumane methods to extract confessions from the members of the Smallholders Party elected by the Hungarian people according to law. The Hungarian people have lost their independence due to the conspiracy of the Soviet Union and the Communists. They are no longer responsible for the words and deeds of the current leaders. I protest this aggression and sincerely hope that the world's comments and the governments of all free countries will take appropriate steps to restore the freedom of the Hungarian people and all oppressed people in Europe.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hungarian Capital, 17th] Suriok, leader of the Hungarian Free Party, declared today: The Communist Party's disruption of the Free Party meeting in Gette yesterday proves that Hungary is a police state. I have cancelled all scheduled political speeches because I do not want to cause the danger of conflict again, unless the freedom of assembly of our party is guaranteed. At the same time, Communist Party members said that Free Party members feel that such riots may start a civil war.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Revision Dispute; Egypt Appeals to Security Council; Prime Minister to Lead Delegation to New York in Person</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 17th] Egyptian Minister of Commerce Heyas declared today that the Egyptian government has formally appealed to the Security Council today, requesting the United Nations mechanism to review the Anglo-Egyptian dispute over the 1936 treaty. Egyptian Prime Minister Nocrassi will personally lead a delegation to attend the Security Council and is expected to depart for New York before the end of the month. The Egyptian government's application was submitted by the Egyptian Embassy in the United States. When the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations broke down in January this year, the Egyptian Prime Minister announced that the purpose of appealing to the Security Council was to demand the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the merger of Sudan and Egypt.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] A foreign spokesperson said tonight that Sir Gadgan, the British representative to the Security Council, has been fully informed of Britain's position in the Anglo-Egyptian dispute. Britain continues to consider this position to be reasonable. Therefore, if Egypt claims that the 1936 treaty has lost its effect due to the failure of the treaty revision negotiations, Britain will correct it. The British government feels that the United Nations mechanism should give appropriate consideration to the following facts: The breakdown of the treaty revision negotiations was due to Britain's sense of responsibility to protect the rights of the Sudanese people, not because of Egypt's demand for the complete withdrawal of British troops. Regarding the latter point, London has already agreed.</p>
<h3>On the Arrest of Betkov, the Bulgarian Prime Minister's Statement</h3>
<p>Determined to Fulfill Treaty Obligations</p>
<p>[Reuters, Sofia, 17th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, in response to the United States' accusation of the Bulgarian government's arrest of opposition leader Betkov, made a statement today, asking foreign bystanders to be patient and not to make noise before Betkov, who is accused of plotting a violent coup, is tried. Mr. Di said that he had explained to the United States the legal reasons for Bet's arrest, and said that if thousands of short-sighted people thought that after Bet's arrest, there would be unrest and riots against the Fatherland Front, such phenomena did not occur. The whole country is peaceful now, because for several months, thoughtful Bulgarians have been aware of Betkov's and his party's actions that are detrimental to the people. Therefore, no one protested against Betkov's arrest. So far, the government has only received two letters defending Betkov. Mr. Di continued, Bulgaria is trying to act in the spirit of the Yalta Agreement and fulfill the armistice agreement and peace treaty. According to this obligation, Bulgaria should not only guarantee the basic freedoms of the people, but also dissolve fascist groups and organizations that engage in anti-United Nations propaganda. The government cannot give freedom to those who attempt to revive fascism, or even prepare to seize power by force.</p>
<h3>Japan Conspired with Germany to Assassinate Stalin; US Discovers Documents in Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 17th] The US Chief Legal Advisor of the War Crimes Tribunal here recently revealed the documents he had collected, pointing out. This book once had a conspiracy to assassinate Stalin in January 1939. At that time, ten Russians who were dissatisfied with the Soviet Union carried bombs and sneaked into the Soviet Union to assassinate him. The document is a memorandum signed by Himmler, the leader of the German secret political police, which was found in his private documents when the Nazis collapsed. Among them, there is the full text of the meeting between Himmler and Oshima, the then Japanese ambassador to Germany, proving that Oshima and  people worked together to conspire against the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Rumor Says Soviet Union Attempted to Conclude Separate Peace with Germany</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 18th Radio: Famous journalist Li Chuetz wrote in "Freedom" that the Soviet Union secretly attempted to conclude a separate peace with Germany in 1943, but then feared that the peace talks would fail and that it would lose the United Nations, so it urgently withdrew its original proposal.</p>
<h3>American Flying Arrow Arrives in London with Journalist Delegation</h3>
<p>World Tour Begins</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The "American Flying Arrow" carrying the American news observer delegation on a world tour has arrived in London, but one of the four engines had problems shortly after takeoff.

<h3>Truman Wins Victory; House Supports Veto of Tax Cut Bill; Only Two Votes Difference; Mr. Du Claims It Was an Accident</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The House of Representatives today, by a margin of two votes, supported President Truman's veto of the $40 billion income tax cut bill. The tax cut issue must be postponed until the 1948 presidential election. Republican Speaker of the House Martin said, "We may have to wait for a Republican president to be born before this matter can be implemented."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] President Truman returned to Washington from Princeton University on the 17th and was very pleased with the House of Representatives' vote to support the president's veto of the income tax cut bill. But Mr. Du must also quickly decide on the Taft-Hartley labor control bill, which is equally important politically. Truman said on his way back, "This move is better than I expected, and I am very grateful to the House of Representatives for supporting my veto." When reporters asked if the president intended to veto the Taft-Hartley bill, he said, "I don't know if I should veto it. I have not yet made a decision on this."</p>
<h3>Australia to Lead British Commonwealth in Participating in Negotiations on Peace Treaty with Japan; Australian Foreign Minister to Visit MacArthur to Exchange Views</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] The future visit of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt to Japan indicates that Australia will be the leading country in the British Commonwealth in the Japanese peace treaty negotiations. It is reported that Mr. Yi will discuss the general outline of the peace treaty with Mr. Mai, and when the British Commonwealth Japan peace treaty issue conference is held in August, Mr. Yi can also present a report based on the observations he made during this trip.</p>
<p>Now all countries recognize that the main problem is to never allow Japan to become an aggressor again. MacArthur now believes that he has caused a spiritual revolution among the Japanese people, but those who pay attention to Japanese affairs still doubt the extent of the spiritual revolution. If all countries accept MacArthur's opinion, then the conditions for the peace treaty with Japan will naturally be more lenient. Japan's territory will almost certainly be limited to the four islands of the mainland. Its arms have been disarmed, and its resources are not enough to launch a war; however, the United States is still wary of the Soviet Union in the Far East, and this wariness has led some Allied personnel to support the strong police force and small air force requested by the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Japan has no hope of recovering the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, or Okinawa, so there are quite a few people who propose that the air force control Japan from these bases after the peace treaty takes effect.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament to Convene as Scheduled</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] After the House of Representatives received the government's request to postpone the convening of the Diet, it convened the Diet Steering Committee on the 18th, and as a result, rejected the government's proposal to postpone the convening to July 1, and decided to hold the opening ceremony on the 23rd as scheduled. The Senate will generally take the same steps as the House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>Rumor Says US Demands France End Conflict in French Indochina; Ho Chi Minh Says It Has Grown into a Long-Term War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] State Department officials confirmed to reporters today that the United States has requested France to take steps to end the conflict in French Indochina. The United States believes that the conflict in French Indochina is very relevant to the unrest in Asia. It is said that the US government gave Ambassador to France Buy Frey a long instruction several weeks ago, and Mr. Jia has officially discussed this matter with French officials, but the official declined to disclose whether the French side has made any guarantees. At the same time, French officials commented on the reports in Paris that the United States had requested France and Vietnam to stop the conflict, saying that since Mr. Jia requested this in Paris and Undersecretary of State Axon in Washington three months ago, the United States has not taken any new diplomatic action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 17th] Viet Minh Radio today broadcast President Ho Chi Minh's appeal to Asian friends, asking them to support the Viet Minh patriots' struggle for freedom. Mr. Ho also encouraged the Viet Minh soldiers and civilians to show more courageous battle achievements. Mr. Ho said: France's attempt to use military force to obtain a decision has failed, and it has now entered a long-term war. The Viet Minh's resistance will eventually defeat the French aggressors.</p>
<h3>US Maritime Strike Spreads to West Coast</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 18th] It is learned that the sailing schedule of ships on the West Coast has been cancelled because the seafarers' strike has affected the West Coast of the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The Association of American Railroads decided today that, starting today, it will stop transporting goods carried by American ships to domestic coastal ports and foreign ports, in order to prevent freight cars from encountering difficulties at ports in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico where seafarers' strikes have occurred. However, if ships continue to sail without being affected by the strike, their goods will still be transported by rail as they should be.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Plans to Establish Immigration Office in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>US Appoints New Ambassador to Argentina</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman today appointed Mr. Bruce, a businessman from Maryland, as the ambassador to Argentina.</p>
<h3>Heart Transplant Successful in Soviet Doctor's Experiment</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] Temikov, a 30-year-old Soviet medical expert, told the Truth newspaper that he had successfully transplanted the heart and spleen of one dog to another, and connected one heart to the heart of another dog. However, none of the dogs survived for more than eight days after the surgery. This experiment is very important, because transplantation surgery can also be used to help humans survive when undergoing chest surgery. When Mr. Te experimented with transplanting an artificial heart into an animal body, the transplanted animal died after several hours. Mr. Te believes that the cause of death was not the malfunction of the artificial heart, but the coagulation of blood when it came into contact with the wall of the artificial heart. He believes that if an artificial heart is made of anti-coagulant material, and an anti-coagulant is injected into the blood at the same time, the artificial heart can complete its task.</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Reviving Fisheries; MacArthur Approves Huge Shipbuilding Plan; Total Tonnage Will Greatly Exceed Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] For the purpose of actively supporting Japan's fisheries, MacArthur's headquarters recently approved a huge Japanese industrial fishing vessel construction plan. According to this plan, Japan will be able to build 268 steel tuna boats and 17 large un-tuna boats, with a total tonnage of 35,300 tons. 442 steel trawlers, with a total tonnage of 40,900 tons. As a result of the implementation of this plan, Japan will be able to build 120 tuna boats with a tonnage of more than ten tons by the end of 1949, with a total tonnage of 72,800 tons, 59 otter trawlers, and another 933 so-called trawlers. The sum of the tonnage will exceed that before the war. By the end of this year, three major fishing fleets will be organized to engage in fishing activities. One-tenth of the East China Sea is also designated as a Japanese fishing ground. According to the person in charge of the Fisheries Section of the Natural Resources Bureau of MacArthur's Headquarters, Japanese fishing boats suffered heavy losses during the war. In 1939, there were about 860 tuna boats with a tonnage of more than 20 tons, totaling 53,600 tons, but in 1946, they decreased to 340, totaling 21,600 tons. In 1939, there were 67 water trawlers with a tonnage of more than 45 tons, which decreased to 16 last year, and another 68 trawlers, which decreased to 38 last year. Therefore, if this shipbuilding plan is not approved, Japan will not be able to maintain its minimum level of fisheries.</p>
<p>Japanese Whaling Fleet to Go to Antarctica</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Government authorities recently told this news agency's reporter that the US Senate and House of Representatives are expected to approve MacArthur's request to allow Japan to send a whaling fleet to Antarctica again in the autumn and winter seasons of this year, or will reply to MacArthur's approval by telegram this week.</p>

<h3>Illegal Gold Transactions Cracked Upstairs at Baocheng New Silver Building on Nanjing Road; Evidence Seized at Yongxingyu Gold Shop, Three People Detained; Economic Investigation Team Officially Concludes Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The police bureau's economic section, together with the Garrison Headquarters, raided the Yongxingyu Gold Shop on the third floor of the Baocheng New Silver Building at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road at 11:00 a.m. yesterday, and seized a black market gold transaction institution. On the spot, they seized large and small gold bars and ornaments that were being traded, weighing more than 120 taels, and a Qingcheng Zhuang deferred check with a face value of 36,927,000 yuan. The three suspects and 15 account books were taken to the bureau, and then sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Commander Xuan's Speech</h3>
<p>[Another Report] Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Yi Wu received reporters from various newspapers yesterday afternoon and answered questions as follows: Since the Economic Investigation Team was ordered to be established in February this year, it has achieved considerable success in stabilizing the financial situation. However, this kind of emergency measure was originally an expedient measure, and the Garrison Headquarters has recently been focusing all its efforts on security, and has no time to take care of it. Therefore, it telegraphed the Chairman a few days ago to request its termination, and the army chairman approved it, and it will be officially terminated on the 18th. Hereafter, events that violate economic laws will be handled by the municipal government. As for the investigation of the Qianzhuang fraud incident on Nanjing Road, there is still no report.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management Should Understand Each Other</h3>
<p>Mr. Xuan explored the current economic problems, and said that solutions should be sought from the root. The fundamental solution lies in the fact that social groups should be organized immediately, generate power, and cooperate and liaise with the government, and prices can be stabilized naturally. With stable prices, low salaries and low wages can also lead to a comfortable life. Now, people in general are abandoning the pursuit of the root and pursuing the branches, thinking that if prices rise, as long as salaries are high and wages are increased, life can be solved. They should know that if salaries and wages increase, prices will also double, and if this cycle continues, it will lead to economic collapse. Therefore, if labor and management can understand each other and coordinate, labor disputes can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Arrested Students</h3>
<p>Regarding the general concern about the current handling and situation of students and reporters arrested on suspicion of being communist conspirators, Mr. Xuan answered reporters' inquiries, stating: The arrested students have not suffered any pain. They are now temporarily isolated from the school. During this time, experts often conduct joint discussions on the problems they have imagined and enable them to have a deeper understanding of current political issues to avoid superficial and immature remarks and actions. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say that they are being educated rather than punished. The situation of the arrested reporters is roughly the same.</p>
<h3>No Traces of Bandits in Neighboring Counties</h3>
<p>Mr. Xuan continued to tell reporters that within the new garrison area, after the implementation of the bandit suppression and village cleansing and joint defense plan, there are no more bandit groups in the counties. A few days ago, in Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian counties, there were several groups of bandits. After troops were dispatched to suppress them, they fled to Zhejiang separately and are being pursued by the Zhejiang security forces.</p>
<p>The current site of the garrison headquarters will be moved out due to the owner's request for repossession. The new site is located in the current port headquarters on Jiangwan Road. The port headquarters has agreed to cede half of the space and a guest house to the garrison headquarters. After repairs and renovations, it is scheduled to move in on July 1st.</p>
<h3>People's Food Allocation Committee Approves the Allocation of Over 10,000 Shi of Rice</h3>
<p>Relocation of Office Starts from the 22nd</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The People's Food Allocation Committee is scheduled to move from the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association to the Lawyers' Association on Huangpi South Road for office work on the 22nd of this month. According to Secretary Zhang of the committee yesterday: Although the Municipal Bank has sent staff to the committee to collect payments, it is limited to banker's drafts. In order to simplify the rice allocation procedures, the Allocation Committee plans to have its cashiers collect small amounts of cash on behalf of the Municipal Bank and issue receipts to avoid the trouble of payers having to go to the bank. Since the application for rice allocation closed on the 21st, there has been a surge of applications. Among the more than 1,700 backlog cases transferred by the Social Affairs Bureau, more than 1,300 have been processed, and more than 10,000 shi of rice have been approved for distribution. The rice allocated to workers recently was all for industrial workers. Occupational workers, such as dock workers and rickshaw pullers, have not yet submitted their lists. For poor people's subsidized rice, letters have been sent to the Civil Affairs Bureau urging all districts to complete the preparations for subsidized rice distribution so that it can begin before the end of the month.</p>
<h3>A Group of Children Living an Inhuman Life: Over Twenty Apprentices from Hua Fu Factory Appeal to the Social Affairs Bureau for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] More than twenty apprentices from the Hua Fu Machine Factory on Tongbei Road went to the Social Affairs Bureau twice yesterday, in the morning and afternoon, to petition for assistance. They were shabbily dressed, with red and swollen eyes, and covered in oil. They were all children of about ten years old. It is said that the factory owner, named Yang Gendang, is an adjunct of the volunteer police brigade. There are more than ten old foremen and more than twenty apprentices in the factory. They start work every morning and do not stop until 12 o'clock at night. After stopping work, they have to clean up and tidy up the workshop before they can sleep. Last month, their monthly wages were 6,000 yuan per person, and this month it has been increased to 10,000 yuan. A few days ago, the factory wanted to add two more hours of work after 12 o'clock. Because they were overworked and unable to do any more, they resisted slightly in their words, which led to the factory owner beating them severely with firewood, injuring five people including Zhang Henian, Zhang Xianghong, and Lu Yunxiang. They had nowhere to complain, so they could only go to the Social Affairs Bureau to ask for assistance. Director Zhao of the Labor Affairs Bureau promised to summon the factory owner to the bureau today for talks and persuade them to return to the factory. However, the apprentices were afraid of being beaten again and claimed that they did not dare to return to the factory.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the Fourth District Machinery Industry Workers' Union decided to send representatives to negotiate with the factory owner today and submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting protection for child laborers.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Arbitration Committee Meeting: Discussion of Index Discount Standards</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 p.m. today. At that time, concrete decisions will be made on the index discount standards and the method of paying wages for the current month according to the index of the previous month.</p>
<h3>Citywide Silk Weaving Industry: Three-Hour Slowdown</h3>
<p>Wage Disputes Reject Price Index Discounts</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of cost of living index discounts in the silk weaving industry in all four districts, the Social Affairs Bureau has convened several mediation sessions. The employers insisted that a uniform discount of 66% be applied, while the employees demanded that a uniform discount of 90% be applied to wages above 30 yuan. The opinions of the two sides failed to converge. The employers then appealed to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for a public judgment. However, the employees believed that the production relations of the silk weaving industry were special and insisted that the index, base salary, and base number should not be changed. The Social Affairs Bureau considered that the actual situation of the industry was different, did not make a mediation decision, and submitted the evaluation to the arbitration committee. Upon hearing this, the workers were deeply dissatisfied. The workers of more than 400 factories citywide staged a slowdown from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. yesterday to express their protest and sent more than 50 representatives, including Lu Lunyan, Tao Yunshan, and Zhou Yunlong, to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition Director Wu to allow the representatives to present their opinions at the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee meeting to be held today.</p>
<h3>Xie Baosheng's Illicit Property: Invitation to Tender for Lease</h3>
<p>Xie Baosheng, the deputy director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police Department, is still being detained by the court. Xie's illicit property is very large, and all of it has been seized by the enemy and puppet property handling agency, pending a verdict before confiscation. A portion of the property that can be used for production, such as the Kader Bathhouse and the Xinzha Hotel, are well-equipped. The enemy and puppet property liquidation office had previously agreed to allow Xie's son to manage and operate it on behalf of his father. Later, because Xie's son was unable to develop the business, the illicit property handling committee decided to publicly invite tenders for lease. The reserve price was set at 50 million yuan by the committee. The lease term is from the first of next month to the end of this year, a total of six months. The deadline for bidding is tomorrow. The public opening of bids will be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 21st. The winning bidder only needs to pay rent to the liquidation office each month, and all surplus business profits belong to the winning bidder. It is also rumored that the Xie-owned shares of the large-scale Xianyue Dance Palace have all been sold. The enemy and puppet property liquidation office has sent staff to thoroughly investigate this matter to determine whether it should be seized according to law.</p>
<h3>Retirement Funds for Former Shanghai Municipal Council Employees: Process and Issue Immediately</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The retirement funds for Chinese employees and police officers of the former Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Property Liquidation Committee for allocation. The first batch of 20 billion national currency yuan has been allocated in full by the central government. All 3,500 registration forms for former employees and police officers of the former Shanghai Municipal Council who have received a public notice have been submitted to the meeting. A review committee has been established today, with two members each from the Liquidation Committee, the Finance Bureau, the Personnel Department, the Secretariat, and the Accounting Department, and two consultants each from the Former Municipal Council Employee General Association and the Police Officers' Association. The first review meeting will be held today to discuss the division of work. The review will start immediately, and payments will be processed and issued as soon as they are reviewed. All retired employees and police officers who have received a notice must bring their identification documents and collect their payments on the designated date.</p>
<h3>Three Bureau Directors Request the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (JRRA) to Allocate Epidemic Prevention Equipment and Medicines</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Director of the Health Bureau, Zhang Wei, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zeng, and the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, hosted a banquet at the City Bank on Jiujiang Road last night at 7:00 p.m. for the responsible persons of the JRRA and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA). Director Zhang reported that the weather is getting hot and epidemics are about to take the opportunity to rise. Although the epidemic prevention work is being actively launched by the Epidemic Prevention Office, it is limited by financial and material resources and cannot be promoted on a large scale. It is hoped that the JRRA will provide assistance in terms of equipment and medicines. According to reports, the most prevalent areas of cholera in the city last year were the shantytowns of Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Nanshi. Because there are no tap water facilities in these areas, residents get their drinking water from earthen wells and polluted ditches, which leads to the breeding of epidemics. Therefore, the Health Bureau plans to connect them to tap water, which is estimated to require approximately 551,000 feet of tap water pipes. There is no such large quantity of water pipes in the city to supply, so it will be necessary to borrow the help of the JRRA to prevent them in time so that the shantytowns can be spared from the catastrophe.</p>
<h3>More Than One Hundred Floating Corpses Have Been Recovered One After Another: The Total Number of Passengers Who Died in the Dafeng Disaster is Difficult to Estimate; Salvage and Burial Continue; Families Discuss Post-Disaster Arrangements</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Pushan Villa in the city, for the handling of the salvage and burial of the passengers who died in the Dafeng shipping disaster, sent another three cars yesterday, carrying more than 40 family members, accompanied by four employees of the shipping company, to the riverside areas of Shiziling in Baoshan County and Liuhe in Taicang. On the Shiziling beach, two more floating corpses were recovered, which were collected by Pushan Villa, but the coffin lids were not nailed so that family members could identify them.</p>
<p>Digging Up Corpses and Identifying Two</p>
<p>At the same time, together with the Shishan County Public Security Bureau, more than 30 corpses buried by nearby residents a few days ago were dug up one by one for family members to identify. All the corpses were rotten and beyond recognition due to water immersion and soil burial. Some were even missing limbs, and some corpses had their clothes washed away by the flood when they were salvaged. Therefore, only two of the more than 30 corpses were identified and claimed by the families of the deceased. One was Zhang Xinliang, male, 35 years old, and the other was also claimed by his family, but the company did not have a record of his name.</p>
<p>Sending Divers to Search the Ship</p>
<p>The salvagers on the Taicang side have not yet returned to Shanghai as of late at night, and the details are unknown. In total, since the Dafeng accident, more than 120 corpses have been salvaged in Baoshan, Taicang, and Liuhe, and new corpses are still being discovered one after another. Therefore, the total number of passengers who died in the Dafeng disaster is still impossible to estimate at this time. The shipping company has decided to send the Shenhua ship with divers to the sea surface where the Dafeng ship sank at 9:00 a.m. this morning, and the divers will dive into the sunken Dafeng ship to search for corpses.</p>
<p>Preliminary Consultation, No Lawsuit for Now</p>
<p>The families of the passengers who died in the disaster held a meeting at the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association on Beihai Road yesterday to discuss how to handle the aftermath. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspapers to the ports along the river to pay attention to the rescued passengers, they also demanded that the company continue to salvage the corpses, and that the shipping company pay compensation to the families of the passengers who have been confirmed dead or missing. At the same time, they requested the maritime authorities to ban all old ships or ships with poor life-saving equipment in order to protect the safety of passengers in the future. In order to understand the shipping company, the families will not file a lawsuit for the time being, but will first conduct direct consultations, hoping to reach a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Shipping Bureau Says Force Majeure</p>
<p>According to the Dafeng Shipping Bureau, the cause of the accident was entirely due to force majeure, and on the night of the 9th of this month, in the midst of a fierce storm, in addition to the sinking of the Dafeng ship, more than 100 other sailing boats and fishing boats were overturned. Therefore, the hundreds of floating corpses that have been discovered in recent days are definitely not all passengers of the Dafeng ship, but it is difficult to identify them because the corpses are rotten. As for the aftermath, consultations will be held after the corpses have been properly disposed of.</p>
<h3>Surveillance Commissioner Yan Returns to Shanghai After Inspection: Discusses the Peacefulness and Tranquility of the Order in Various Places</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner Yan Zhuangguo returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 17th after inspecting the three counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou. Mr. Yan told reporters on the 18th: People in all the places he visited filed complaints, and he investigated and handled them in detail one by one. At present, the order in various places is still peaceful and tranquil, and the recovery work is also progressing. Although the conscription of soldiers and grain causes some suffering to the people, the way it is being handled is significantly better than in the past, and there are few flaws in local politics. Mr. Yan expressed his indignation at the incident in which the military officer corps stationed in Tongli, Wujiang, raped and killed the female teacher Zou Yue'e. He said that the 2,000 members of the corps are scattered in residential homes, and smoking, gambling, and prostitution occur from time to time. The Ministry of National Defense urgently needs to deal with it properly. The surveillance commissioner has sent staff to thoroughly investigate this rape and murder case. He also pointed out that the recent cracking of the case in Changzhou involving the private supply of military fire to the Communist Party in northern Jiangsu is noteworthy. The incident had occurred for more than half a year, and rumors had been circulating among the people for a long time, but it was not cracked until recently, which shows that it was definitely not done by ordinary merchants and civilians.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers Coming to Shanghai from the Rear: To Be Resettled or Repatriated; Li Jianhua Talks After Returning to Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director of the Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee, was summoned to Nanjing by the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 14th to discuss the way out and relief for unemployed workers. There are still more than 1,800 unemployed workers from the rear areas who came to Shanghai at the Yangshupu Military Industry Road Reception Center. Because the CNRRA is coming to an end, the supply is becoming a problem, and a decision from the Ministry of Social Affairs is pending. Mr. Li returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties in Nanjing. He told reporters yesterday afternoon: In addition to the unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear areas, there have been many factory shutdowns and layoffs recently due to shrinking production, totaling more than 100,000 people according to investigations. During this trip to Nanjing, the Ministry of Social Affairs held a total of three meetings, all chaired by Minister Gu. Two principles were decided after research: (1) The Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Resources Committee will open up methods to resettle unemployed workers. (2) Those who voluntarily return to their hometowns will be given severance pay. Those who cannot be resettled or cannot return to their hometowns will still be given relief. The Ministry of Social Affairs will invite the above-mentioned agencies to discuss resettlement methods within days. This relief principle is temporarily limited to unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear areas. General unemployment is not covered by this example.</p>
<h3>The Eight Defendants in the National Grain Loan Case Are Found Not Guilty; Meeting the Requirements of the Amnesty Decree Should Be Pardoned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The grain loan case, which shook the country and lasted for more than a year, was pronounced in the local court yesterday. Criminal Division Chief Wu Yegua, accompanied by Judges Huang Guangyu, Mei Erhe (acting), and Clerk [blank], took the prisoners Wang Yunren, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wu Rongsheng, etc., and took their seats in the second criminal court. All four defendants on bail, Ren Xingyai, Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, and Yang Runyu, were not present in court. Chief Judge Wu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, Yang Runyu, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingyai are all found not guilty." Chief Judge Wu sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment, and then instructed the prisoners to remain in custody for the time being, pending the determination of this judgment, before being released. The lawyers of the defendants requested permission to post bail because the defendants had been detained until now, and since they have now been found not guilty, they submitted a written application to be decided at a later date. The reasons for the judgment are appended below:</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>Those who committed crimes before December 31, 1946, and whose most severe sentence is imprisonment of less than a fixed term shall be pardoned. Moreover, those who have been previously granted amnesty shall be given a judgment of non-guilty. Article A of the National Government's January 1, 1947 Amnesty Decree and Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly stipulate that the defendant Wang Xunzhi in this case is the Deputy General Manager of the Yangtze River Company, and Zhuang Hanzhang is its Business Director. The defendant Wan Molin is the Manager of the Wanchang Rice Shop. In April of last year, the central government, in response to the request of the Shanghai Municipal Government Chamber of Commerce Temporary Council and local communities, ordered the Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food to organize grain loans, lending 600,000 legal tender to the company and rice shop. The defendants, taking advantage of the rising grain prices, concealed the rice purchased with the loans without selling it, or bought and sold it themselves, with the intention of manipulating it. The defendant Wu Pingsheng is the manager of the Santai Rice Shop, and he resold the rice entrusted to him for sale by the government to suppress grain prices without selling it. He engaged in speculative monopoly and manipulation of rice and grain. The defendant Wang Daren is the Acting Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office, and Ren Xingyai is the Chief of the Regulation Section. Both bear the heavy responsibility of grain administration. Increasing the grain reserves in Shanghai and suppressing grain prices are their duties. In other words, they have the obligation to prevent rising grain prices, but the defendants had no thorough plan in advance and lacked emergency measures afterward,</p>
<p>and through inaction and delay</p>
<p>in a short month, grain prices soared from tens of thousands of yuan per shi to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, causing public panic and widespread criticism. They even announced the suspension of the sale of loaned rice on May 1, citing market chaos, which was an act of helping speculative monopoly and manipulation, and the circumstances were obvious. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner of the Control Yuan filed an impeachment, and the criminal part was transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and clarification. The defendants Zhu Xuanzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wan Molin were charged with Article 31 of the Emergency Period Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations, and the defendants Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai were charged with Article 31 of the same regulations, Article 15, Article 30, and Article 134 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>A public prosecution was filed.</p>
<p>Article 12 of the Emergency Period Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations clearly stipulates that "Producers or operators of designated enterprises and goods shall not engage in speculative monopoly or other manipulative behavior." Article 31 of the same regulations also stipulates that "Those who violate the provisions of Article 12 and engage in speculative monopoly or other manipulative behavior shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years and fined one to three times the profits obtained." This crime is a crime punishable by imprisonment of less than a fixed term, and the period of the defendants' crime was before December 31, 1946, so they could have been pardoned in time, but criminal proceedings are based on the discovery of</p>
<p>truth as the main goal</p>
<p>and Article 246 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also stipulates that "If the prosecutor prosecutes part of the facts of the crime, its effect extends to the whole." This case concerns the people's food, and since grain prices suddenly soared after the grain loan was organized, this court believes that there is a connection to whether there was collusion for personal gain and corruption, so it does not shy away from seeking details and conducts further investigation. Therefore, whether the defendants Wang Daren, etc. can be pardoned should also be determined by whether there are circumstances of seeking personal gain or corruption. This court repeatedly interrogated the defendants Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai, who both denied receiving review fees, referral fees, black market interest, or bribes from the grain merchants, nor did they have an agreement with the grain merchants to share profits. The grain merchants Zhu Yongming, Gu Yisheng, Chuan Changyu, Feng Yongsheng, Yu Liangji, Zhang Chao, Xu Taiyuan, Zhu Shilu, Wang Yuzhen, Lu Linxun, Xing Songwen, and Shao Jigao, who were brought to court,</p>
<p>were questioned separately</p>
<p>and all made sworn statements proving that they had never paid review fees, referral fees, black market interest, or bribes and any illegal benefits to the personnel of the Grain Administration Office. The witness Xu Jiliang also stated in court: "There is no such thing as collecting review fees or referral fees, and the grain administration personnel did not collude with the grain merchants." When asked "In terms of grain loans, did you hear about any illegal interest besides the official interest?", he said "I did not hear about it." The witness Xi Wangshu also stated in court that "The grain loans were organized by the government finding grain merchants, so why would grain merchants collude with grain administration personnel? The rise in grain prices was caused by the rice-producing areas raising prices one after another when they heard that Shanghai was organizing grain loans, and the main reason was actually inflation." When asked "Did the grain administration personnel take any money?", he replied "No." When asked again "In addition to the official interest of three points, was there any black interest on the loan?", he replied again "There is definitely no such thing as black interest."</p>
<p>Xu Jiliang is the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the speaker of the Shanghai Temporary Council of the People's Livelihood Organization at the time, and he has made a sworn statement, so his testimony</p>
<p>is credible.</p>
<p>Xi Tianshu is also the speaker of the Shanghai Temporary Council and has also made a sworn statement, and he has no grievances with the defendants, so his testimony is also worthy of adoption. Furthermore, after checking the files investigated by the prosecutors of this court and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and various account books and forms, no evidence has been found that the defendants Wang Daren, etc. colluded with each other for personal gain. According to Article 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, "The facts of the crime should be determined based on evidence," the fact that the defendants Wang Daren, etc. engaged in corruption and seeking personal gain cannot be determined. Therefore, the articles of law cited in the prosecutor's indictment cannot but be considered proper. Therefore, although the defendants Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingyai have engaged in speculative monopoly, manipulative behavior, or helping speculative monopoly and manipulative behavior, constituting a crime under Article 31 of the Emergency Period Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations, they are fortunate to be granted the grace of the national amnesty and meet the provisions of Article A of the National Government's January 1, 1947 Amnesty Decree,</p>
<p>and are spared pardon.</p>
<p>Except for the part of whether the defendants Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai were derelict in their duties, which is not within the scope of justice and will be handled separately by their competent authorities, the defendants Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingyai shall be given a judgment of non-guilty. If the defendants Yang Runyu and Xing Zhigang privately assigned loans, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 339, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, even if the crime is established, because the most severe sentence for the crime is imprisonment of not more than five years, and the period of the crime was before December 31, 1946, it also meets the provisions of Article A of the Great Relief Order and should naturally be in the list of pardons, and</p>
<p>should be found not guilty. Based on the above arguments, the judgment shall be based on Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article A of the National Government's Amnesty Decree, as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>Security Association Launches Campaign to Comfort Military, Police, and Gendarmerie: Decides to Request Banks to Advance 100 Million</h3>
<p>The Social Security Promotion Association launched an initiative to invite various groups to raise funds to comfort the military, police, and gendarmerie of the city during the Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday, due to the short time, it was unable to raise funds in an orderly manner. Therefore, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiliang, Wu Yun, and other invited banking circles to discuss ways to advance funds. Liu Gongyun, Xu Guangjian, Zhao [blank]hua, Li Shuming, Dao Zhongtao, Wang Xinshu, and others attended.

<h3>Withdrawal of Charges in Assault Case; Seven Students from Shanghai Law College Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Eleven students from Shanghai Law College, including Qu Yuan and Su Shuyuan, were involved in a case concerning their fellow students at the college. The case was previously investigated and concluded by the prosecutor's office, and charges were filed under Article 277, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The District Court had scheduled a hearing for the 14th of this month. However, as both parties wished to negotiate a settlement out of court, they applied for a postponement, which was approved by the presiding judge. Later, under the mediation of Chu Yi, the acting president of the college, the victims, including Mao Yong, submitted a written request for withdrawal of the charges on the afternoon of the 18th. The presiding judge, considering that the crime involved was subject to prosecution only upon complaint, ruled that the case would not be accepted since the charges had been withdrawn.

<h3>Auction of German Overseas Chinese Properties Yields 34 Billion; Remaining Pigments and Medicines Valued at Approximately 150 Billion</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The German Overseas Chinese Property Liquidation Office has been liquidating the properties of German Overseas Chinese for the past year, and this work has now come to an end. According to rough estimates by the person in charge of the office, the proceeds from auctions since the beginning of the liquidation amount to 25 billion yuan for Defu pigments, 7.2 billion yuan for Bayer medicines, and approximately 2 billion yuan for other miscellaneous items and furniture, totaling more than 34 billion yuan. Except for a small portion of Defu pigments and Bayer medicines, all other properties of German overseas Chinese, including the small amount of remaining stock and assets from German trading companies such as Lihe, Siemens, Meizuishi, Kongshi, and Lulin, have been completely liquidated. Although the quantity of remaining pigments and medicines is only a small fraction of what was originally received, due to rising prices, the current estimated value of the pigments is approximately 120 billion yuan, and the value of the medicines is approximately 30 billion yuan. Because the government had a plan to establish state-owned factories at the beginning of this year, these remaining pigments and medicines were not auctioned. However, due to changes in economic policy, which emphasized the private operation of small industries, state-owned institutions were not established. However, selling to private enterprises also proved difficult due to technical issues, and no deal was reached. Recently, the government announced that these remaining pigments and medicines would be used as collateral for U.S. dollar bonds, but the detailed procedures have not yet been determined. The office's current work is to handle the return of scattered German overseas Chinese property rights and other matters, awaiting the government's decision to establish a new agency.</p>
<h3>New Cheng and Changshu Districts; Bao Chiefs Elected One After Another</h3>

<p>In Changshu District, the 37th Bao held its first popularly elected Bao Chief Assembly at the Salvation Church on Wuyuan Road at 9:00 AM on the 17th. As a result of the election, Chen Zhuo was elected Bao Chief, and Sun Kezhong was elected Deputy Bao Chief.

<h3>Cultural Seedling in the Jungle; Lushan Library</h3>
<p>— Report from Nanchang by Our Newspaper Reporter Liu Zao on the 12th</p>
<p>The Lushan Library is a cultural seedling in the jungle of Guling. It was proposed to be built fourteen years ago in the summer, and the library site was completed in July of the 24th year of the Republic of China. During the founding process, Chairman Chiang inspected the construction, and the location of the library was chosen by the chairman himself. The old man who used to live in a dilapidated house can still describe the process of choosing the library site in detail.</p>
<p>Served as Barracks for Isolated Troops</p>
<p>In the past years, it was unfortunately washed by more than eight years of war, serving as barracks for isolated troops in Lushan and used by the Japanese army as a military ammunition depot. It fell to the enemy on April 18th of the 28th year, along with Guling, and it was not until October 29th of the 34th year that it was restored. Now, it still stands tall under Guniu Ridge, becoming an emerging business in Lushan.</p>
<p>Last summer, Chairman Chiang came to Guling and ordered the Executive Yuan to subsidize the library's operating expenses by 20 million yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Government approved the distribution of the operating expenses, with 9 million yuan for new book purchases, 6 million yuan for copying and supplementing missing volumes, and 5 million yuan for various equipment expenses. After receiving this subsidy, the library began to organize last winter, and now it is classifying and cataloging books.</p>
<p>Increased Rare Books After the War</p>
<p>The collection of the Lushan Library was small before the war because it was established in a short time. The number of books is not currently available in the catalog or records. After the war, the library received a lot of rare books because the books collected from various places were looted by the Japanese army and came to the mountains. According to the report at the time of the reception, there were 53,321 volumes of Chinese books and 8,864 volumes of Western books, totaling 62,185 volumes. Among these books, the 8,864 volumes of Western books are stored in a special room, and the 53,321 volumes of Chinese books are two-thirds thread-bound ancient books and one-third ordinary modern books, which are also stored in separate rooms.</p>
<p>Need Copying Talent</p>
<p>Among the Chinese ancient books, there are nearly 10,000 volumes of rare books, of which about 120 volumes are missing and need to be copied and supplemented, and about 1,000 volumes need to be bound and repaired. They are now in need of specialists who are good at copying and repairing. Among these thread-bound ancient books, there are more belonging to the history and collection categories and fewer belonging to the classics and philosophy categories. Only a dozen books belong to the category of books on rhymes, and the category of books on records only includes the provincial and county records of 35 provinces and their subordinate counties.</p>
<p>Most of the ordinary books were published before the 26th year of the Republic of China, and most of them were published by the Commercial Press, totaling more than 21,000 volumes. However, there are many duplicates. After removing the duplicates, there are only more than 8,000 original copies. There is also a shortage of reference books.</p>
<p>Officially Opens This Summer</p>
<p>They are now preparing to officially open this summer, and most of the preparatory work has been completed. They will also set up street reading rooms and cultural apartments in Lotus Cave and Guling City to accommodate celebrities and scholars at low cost. They also plan to hold academic seminars and lectures.</p>

The definition of "amateur athlete" in the report submitted by the subcommittee is as follows: "An amateur athlete is one who does not have any material gain, whether direct or indirect, for athletic competition other than considering it a sport." Sports circles claim that compensation for lost wages after participating in sports competitions is not a gain, but merely an avoidance of loss. However, the final interpretation will be decided by the national sports associations themselves.</p>

<h3>·Shen Tianyi Cup Basketball Tournament· Grand Final Held</h3>
<p>[Guoguang News Agency, Shenyang] The Tianyi Cup basketball tournament sponsored by the Shenyang branch of the Lizhi Society has been held since the start of the tournament, with a single round-robin system. The champions of the five divisions have been produced, and they are the teams Tax Union, Zhongchang, Shenqing, Daqing, and Fourth Middle School. After the sponsor decided to use a single round-robin system for the overall final, this overall final started at 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd in the gym of the society, and Mrs. Xiong, the director's wife, personally attended the opening ceremony. The audience was crowded, setting a record for the Shenyang basketball tournament after the war, and the situation was very enthusiastic. In the first game, Shenqing defeated Zhongchang 45-28. In the second game, Daqing defeated Fourth Middle School 33-22. The second act of the overall final on the 5th was also very exciting. In the first battle, Tax Union played against Fourth Middle School. Tax Union was the champion of the Zhongzheng Cup last year, and its players such as Ma Chunhe and Liu Jianhua were all first-class players in the basketball world with superb skills. It is hoped that they will be selected to attend the National Games, so the team's strength is very strong. Fourth Middle School was no match for them. As a result, Tax Union defeated Fourth Middle School 54-17. In the second act, Shenqing played against Daqing. The battle was very intense, but Daqing's actions were rude and fouled repeatedly. In the third quarter, when Shenqing led 17-11, Daqing's actions became even more violent. The referee successively penalized two players from the Daqing team. Daqing did not reflect on its actions and announced that it would abstain. It did not care about sportsmanship, which is a pity for the sports world. Shenqing won two consecutive games.</p>

<h3>Tea Production May Increase Three or Fourfold This Year; Tea Merchants Hope Government Will Purchase; Can Be Exchanged for US$2 Million at Current Prices</h3>
<p>The tea season in various regions is coming to an end, but the purchase work is not being actively promoted as other export goods. According to tea industry leaders, last year's tea production was about 80,000 dan. This year, tea farmers in various regions have made arrangements for weeding and fertilizing, and the total production is expected to increase three or fourfold, with a total amount estimated to reach 300,000 dan. However, tea merchants believe that the originally planned tea loans are too far from the actual needs, which has reduced their interest. According to the tea loan principle, tea merchants must first raise funds to purchase raw tea and then apply for loans. Tea merchants are based on the fact that last year's old tea inventory was stagnant, and the capital loss was huge. Before the inventory is sold, it is impossible for new tea to be purchased in large quantities. Currently, the only finished tea for export is Qihong, which totals 25,000 boxes, equivalent to 12,000 shi dan. Other teas such as Tunlv, which can produce more than 35,000 dan, and Pinglv, which can produce more than 70,000 dan, are limited by capital and cannot be developed. If these problems can be solved, the total number of red and green tea for export should not be difficult to reach more than 100,000 boxes. Although the peak tea season has passed, it is still possible to recover by catching up. The method is nothing more than the government quickly issuing a purchase policy for entrusting tea merchants to produce raw tea on their behalf. The most reasonable suggestion is to convert it according to the price of rice. It is also said that tea is a major export commodity of our country. If 100,000 dan of boxed tea is estimated, it can be exchanged for about 2 million US dollars according to the current overseas price ratio, which can enrich the national army. It can also maintain the international market and prevent it from being seized by other countries' tea. In addition, if tea farmers in producing areas benefit and the rural economy is active, it can also help with social security problems.</p>
<h3>After Continuous Rise in Yongsha Shares, the Trend Turned Weak Near Closing</h3>
<p>After continuing to rise yesterday, the major players in the Huagu market were exhausted and unable to sustain their momentum. Whenever Yongsha shares moved, small shares went from bad to worse. Since the loopholes could not be filled, and the news that Fangjian would pay a huge settlement today and that the securities margin would adopt a progressive system was frequently reported, the market finally became timid near the close, and the trend was unfavorable.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the market was slightly firmer due to the news of the economic reform plan. After Yongsha shares opened higher, numbers 54, 185, and 223 bought, and numbers 94, 148, and 154 bought Yongsha shares in cash, pushing the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares to 7,900 yuan. Numbers 218 and 50 sold Yongsha shares in cash, and numbers 19, 234, 155, and 154 sold to 7,790 yuan. Numbers 89, 78, 142, and 32 still bought, and numbers 219 and 76 also bought Yongsha shares in cash, rising to 7,900 yuan. Numbers 154, 186, 162, and 129 sold to 7,770 yuan. Numbers 76, 32, 148, 224, 223, and 155 came in to buy, and numbers 219 and 152 bought Yongsha shares in cash again, pushing the price to 7,770 yuan, and the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares also rose to a high price of 7,600 yuan. Numbers 108, 234, 14, and 200 sold, and number 83 also sold Yongsha shares in cash. Although Lianhua Real Estate was raised to the limit by number 162 again, it was still forced down to 7,750 yuan. Business was raised to the limit by number 17 and others, and numbers 24, 48, and 97 bought again to 7,900 yuan. Due to rumors that Fangjian would pay a huge settlement of 120 billion yuan, numbers 60, 157, 235, 102, 163, and 153 settled their positions, and at 11:30, the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares fell to 7,620 yuan. However, at noon, due to the strong buying by numbers 157, 35, and 231, plus numbers 104 and 61 also buying Yongsha shares in cash, the last movement pushed the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares to 7,850 yuan. After number 3 sold Yongsha shares in cash, numbers 112, 223, 119, 61, and 100 sold, and near the close, the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares fell to 7,510 yuan. Yongsha shares in cash were 7,180 yuan. It was rumored in the market that the margin deposit would adopt a progressive system if it exceeded 30 billion yuan, and it was also said that representatives of the brokers' association would go to Beijing in the evening to discuss the matter. The noon closing was slightly stable. After the closing, numbers 100 and 8 sold again, and the asking price was as low as 7,470 yuan. As a result, it was comparable to the previous closing. In terms of immediate delivery, Yongsha, Xinguang, Jingfu, Dongxing, Xinhe, and Meiya Xinhua fell slightly, Zhongfa and Huafeng each fell by half a percentage point, Yonggong alone rose slightly, Business rose to the limit and then rebounded, rising by half a percentage point, Lianhua rose to the limit, Neiyi, Datong, and Zhongfang rose slightly, Jinglun rose by a little less than 10%, Guohuo rose by half a percentage point, Huochai, Wuhe, and Tongyi fell slightly, Shuini and Xinya fell by half a percentage point, and Liana fell by 10%. Zhongsir and Rongfeng were flat. In terms of forward delivery, Yongsha, Xinguang, and Yonggong rose slightly, and Xinhe, Meiya, Huaqin, and Jingfu fell slightly. Most of the old shares outside the market were weak.</p>
<p>In swap trading, the arbitrage interest rate was yesterday between 1.3 jiao and 1.7 jiao, mostly around 1.5 jiao. Yongsha was bid up by numbers 220, 45, 110, 56, 74, 106, and 177. After opening at 380 yuan, it retreated to 320 yuan. Numbers 85, 102, 117, and 235 bid down, and finally settled at around 350 yuan. Huafeng was 5 yuan to 5.5 yuan, Xinguang was 6.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan, and Xinhe was 120 yuan to 145 yuan. The banks will be closed on the 20th of this month, and the stock exchange will also be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Uniform Bonds Flat, Foreign Shares Declining</h3>
<p>Government bonds were flat yesterday, only Uniform Bond E showed a slight rise, with a limited range of fluctuations. Uniform Bond C opened in the morning at 7,300 yuan, with a low of 7,200 yuan, a high of 7,700 yuan, and finally hovered around 7,400 yuan. Rooms 555, 503, and 360 all bought, and rooms 552, 604, and 230 all sold. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A, B, and D were all flat, Uniform Bond C rose slightly by 100 yuan, Uniform Bond E also rose by 300 yuan, and the turnover was about 5.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign shares were quite weak yesterday, and small shares such as Shipping and Steel were even more unsustainable. Yi Sha opened in the morning at 69,600 yuan, with limited trading. Retail investors were in and out, and securities firms supplied, gradually falling to a low price of 65,000 yuan, and then stabilizing. Hong Kong Shen Dian Hui rose to about 14.5 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Shipping and Steel each fell by more than 10%, Ying Lianye Guang each fell by less than 10%, and Yi Sha, Hui De Feng Paper, and Yi Beer each fell by about half a percentage point.</p>
<h3>Food Rice People's Hearts Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 5,200 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The interior was selling well, and the people's hearts were firm. Both japonica and indica rice in the two markets rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but the turnover at the close was still sluggish, and the situation was weak to rise. The low price of flour also affected the rice market to some extent.</p>
<p>Due to the large supply from factories, the allocation of flour continued, and the market was stable. Bran was actively sold in rural areas, gradually rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake was in great demand for actual sales, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The supply of oil from the northeast decreased, and customers were confident, soaring by 40,000 to 60,000 yuan. The shops strengthened their purchases. Soybeans were still firm, green beans temporarily stabilized, and red beans remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Red grain was sluggish and returned to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan lower. Corn was not selling well, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Hunan turned around, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Sesame was still firm and continued to rise. Broad beans were pouring in, the market was sluggish, and they were falling steadily, cutting another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat was temporarily stable.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Foreign Rice in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Chen" ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Rangoon, carrying 7,000 tons (approximately 70,000 bags) of small-sized rice. It is docked at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading and transfer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the British company's "Awdh" ship, carrying over 9,900 bales of cotton from Mumbai, arrived at the port the day before yesterday evening and is currently berthed at the Kung Ho Cheung Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Trending High</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market saw rising cotton yarn prices, strengthening market confidence, and a universally bullish outlook. Yarn factories, selling finished products, were eager to replenish raw materials, creating substantial demand. Dealers actively sought to secure supplies, leading to intense competition among traders. The market was characterized by strong buying interest, but holders were inclined to observe and were unwilling to sell easily, creating a competitive buying atmosphere. Transaction volumes for high-grade cotton were limited, while those for ordinary cotton were slightly lower than the previous day. Afternoon trading saw opening prices for factory delivery: Lingbao cotton ranged from 1,595,000 to 1,620,000, 1,630,000 to 1,650,000. Shashi cotton ranged from 1,440,000 to 1,490,000 to 1,500,000. Tongzhou cotton was priced at 1,400,000, and Hankou fine cotton at 1,200,000. Prices for warehouse delivery opened with Lingbao cotton at 1,550,000 and 1,670,000, Tongzhou cotton at 1,250,000 to 1,275,000, and Hankou fine cotton at 1,140,000, 1,200,000 to 1,330,000, and 1,430,000. Mixed coarse Hankou fine cotton was at 1,170,000, Laohekou cotton at 1,330,000, Chongshashi cotton at 1,380,000, fire-engine cotton at 1,120,000, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 192,000 to 212,000 per bundle. (Note) The significant price difference between the lowest and highest prices of Hankou fine cotton was due to excessive mixing of coarse cotton within the fine cotton and excessive moisture content, failing to meet standards. According to common cotton market practice, most cotton grades involve a mix of coarse and fine fibers. Fine cotton with only 10-20% coarse fiber content is considered a higher grade, hence the higher price.</p>
<h3>Stable Silk and Satin Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market remained firm, similar to the previous day. No. 120 Gaoshan shiny rayon opened at 19,750,000 yuan, but due to weak actual sales, the price declined. The noon closing price was 19,600,000 yuan, and in the afternoon, a small transaction of 19,500,000 yuan took place. The Dongyang brand was traded at 9,650,000 yuan in the afternoon for goods without wooden crates. No transactions were recorded for No. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss rayon, and the asking price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The factory-direct silk market was also firm yesterday. Grade C silk saw official transactions, with new goods priced at 25,000,000 yuan and old goods at 24,230,000 yuan, both with seven-day terms. Grade D new goods were quoted at 4,500,000 yuan, and other grades maintained the same asking prices as the previous day. New goods were sold separately. Transactions yesterday were recorded at several levels, ranging from 22,500,000 to 23,500,000 yuan. Thrown silk remained sluggish, and asking prices showed no change. Yesterday's silk fabrics market continued to be brisk. Da Cheng quilt covers were quoted at 9,400,000 yuan, while Hua Qiang quilt covers were traded at 9,200,000 yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Da Cheng checkered crepe opened at 34,600-34,700 yuan, but due to strong trading interest, the price rose. The final closing price was 50,000 yuan for spot, and 52,000 yuan for next-day delivery, up 500 yuan from the previous day. In the rayon fabrics market, Hua Jin crepe saw high-grade goods traded at 18,000 yuan yesterday. Sheng Huo imitation power-loom cloth for upper garments was priced at 275,000 yuan. Luo spun fabrics saw stable prices due to a lack of demand.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market remained strong despite the China Textile Construction Corporation's yarn offering. This was due to frequent demand from local dyeing and weaving factories, active purchasing by Hankou dealers, and the participation of external speculative capital. As a result, 20-count yarn reached a new peak, with Special Double Horse yarn priced at 9,400,000 yuan and Double Horse yarn at 8,470,000 yuan, an increase of 300,000-500,000 yuan from the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn also saw a substantial increase of 750,000 yuan. Prices for 32-count, 20-count, and 16-count yarns jumped by 300,000 to 700,000-800,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Continued Increase in Prices of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw a sudden reduction in quotas by the China Textile Construction Corporation, leading to speculation among various parties. Small retail investors and new buyers from the northern provinces competed to purchase goods, resulting in dwindling inventory and rising prices. Ultimately, various grades of 12-pound fine cloth rose by 15,000-16,000 to over 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dark blue cloth, raw cloth, and Shilin cloth also increased by 20,000-40,000 yuan. Other markets for fine twill, poplin, etc., were also quite brisk.</p>
<h3>Worsted Mill Selling Off July Futures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Worsted Mill is selling tens of thousands of pounds of "Queen" brand fine worsted yarn for July delivery. The factory's asking price is 200,000 yuan per pound. Furthermore, "Fine Hero" from the Anle Mill, "Double Cat" coarse worsted from the Shanghai Worsted Mill, and "Double Sheep" coarse worsted from the Yumin Mill are all selling July futures.

<h3>Group Dividend Savings Program to be Implemented Once Approved by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Nanjing, 18th] The group dividend savings program is about to be implemented. The plan has been approved by the Joint Council of the Four Banks and submitted to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Development Finance Corporation, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau for joint management. The Ministry of Finance believes that the plan can be implemented, but it does not need to be handled by the five banks, only by the China Development Finance Corporation. It is reported that the plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and will be implemented once approved. The group dividend savings program is divided into two types, A and B. Type A stipulates that every 10,000 households form a group, each household saves 100,000 yuan for a period of six months. At the end of the period, a lottery is drawn. The first-place winner receives a dividend of 10,000,000 yuan. The second-place winners (two winners) each receive a dividend of 1,000,000 yuan. The third-place winners (six winners) each receive a dividend of 500,000 yuan. The fourth-place winners (100 winners) each receive 50,000 yuan. Type B stipulates that every 10,000 households form a group, each household saves 100,000 yuan for a period of three months. At the end of the period, a lottery is drawn. The first-place winner receives a dividend of 5,000,000 yuan. The second-place winners (two winners) each receive a dividend of 2,000,000 yuan. The third-place winners (100 winners) each receive a dividend of 100,000 yuan. However, each household in Type B can be divided into two households, each saving 50,000 yuan, and the dividend is calculated at one-half. At the end of both Type A and Type B periods, the principal and interest are returned. The interest rate for Type A is 1%, and the interest rate for Type B is 0.6%.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Intestine Casing Costs</h3>
<p>After the decontrol of the cost of living index, many intestine casing businesses are unable to sustain themselves and have announced closures. It is reported that the current actual cost has reached over 11,500,000 yuan per barrel, while the US market price is only equivalent to 7,220,000 yuan in federal currency, resulting in a loss of over 4,300,000 yuan. The UK price is only 5,750,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of over 5,700,000 yuan. Although Switzerland can sell at over 10,900,000 yuan, the required amount is minimal and demand has been met. Therefore, the intestine casing industry is extremely bleak and unable to export.</p>

<h3>US Dollar Subscription Vouchers: Registered Vouchers Must Retain Seal Impressions</h3>
<p>This year's government-issued US dollar government bonds and short-term treasury bills are divided into registered and unregistered types. For unregistered vouchers, the subscriber cannot report a loss if they are lost or destroyed. Registered subscribers must leave a seal impression. If the subscription is destroyed or lost, the subscriber must report the loss to the selling bank or firm and publish a statement in the newspaper. After three months, a replacement will be issued. The Ministry of Finance has issued a clear order to the Central Bank to comply with the above regulations. The Central Bank issued a public announcement yesterday and instructed the handling banks and firms to follow suit.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Corporation Distributes Yarn to Out-of-Town Reproduction Industries for the First Time; Allocation Temporarily Suspended for 90 Manufacturers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 865 pieces, all to manufacturers. A total of 262 companies applied.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company distributed yarn to out-of-town reproduction industries for the first time. Of the 865 pieces of yarn sold yesterday, out-of-town manufacturers accounted for 429 pieces. The distribution standard is based on the number of looms in operation at each factory, with appropriate discounts based on the China Textile Construction Corporation's cotton yarn supply. The distribution will take place once a month on the Wednesday of the third week. Yesterday's distribution was as follows: Changzhou 140 pieces, Wuxi 80 pieces, Changshu 65 pieces, Nanhui 50 pieces, Jiangyin 35 pieces, Ningbo 30 pieces, Suzhou 18 pieces, Songjiang 6 pieces, Jingjiang 5 pieces.</p>
<p>In addition, as a result of the company's recent general survey of manufacturers, of the first batch of 460 companies, about one-fifth, or 90 companies, have had their allocations temporarily suspended due to reasons such as relocation, incomplete accounting, work stoppage, and absence of responsible personnel. Once the problems are resolved, the allocations will be restored. The results of the second batch of general surveys will be announced next week.</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with dealers actively replenishing their stocks. With slightly looser credit conditions, there were few resales in the market, and demand was strong. The inadequate supply of goods led to a surge in prices. By the afternoon, the latest ten brands of British cigarettes had risen by 140,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 6,480,000 yuan. Old Dao cigarettes also rose by 160,000 yuan, Five Flowers Hardman rose by 70,000-80,000 yuan, and other Chinese cigarettes also saw slight gains. Throughout the day, the American six-stick cigarettes and gift packages were actively selling, with retail dealers seeking each pack at a price increase of 1,500 yuan. The prices of Morris, Camel, and other brands increased by 400-500 yuan. There were many transactions for canned cigarettes, and the listed price rose to 52,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Continued Relaxation in Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw continued stagnation and a downward trend due to sluggish sales. The association's listed prices were: Peruvian sugar 546,000 to 544,000 yuan, a small decrease of over 10,000 yuan. No. 20 Medium White Sugar 430,000 yuan, a small decrease of 15,000 yuan. Three-and-a-Half Car White Sugar 480,000 yuan, a small decrease of 10,000 yuan. Hechi Red Sugar 360,000 yuan. No. 1 Goods opened at 295,000 to 290,000 yuan, a small decrease of 10,000 yuan. Cotton Red Sugar 335,000 yuan, also a decrease of 10,000 yuan. Diaoqing Sugar 280,000 yuan, Xinghua White Sugar 435,000 to 430,000 yuan, Xinghua Red Sugar 330,000 to 315,000 yuan, all small decreases of over 10,000 yuan. Total transactions were approximately 300 pieces.</p>
<h3>Slight Improvement in Tea Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign tea market saw only Loochong and Pei Feng Tea Companies still attracting inquiries, while the rest remained stagnant, resulting in limited transactions. The process changed little under these circumstances. However, domestic sales of red and green tea by local shops and Suzhou dealers remained active, strengthening market confidence. Sellers continued to raise prices. Although prices did not increase dramatically, they showed a gradual increase compared to the past, and the base price was very stable. The future outlook is predicted to be positive.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Silk Subcommittee Review Meeting Scheduled for this Morning</h3>

<h3>Modern International Historical Materials Compilation: The Origins and Tasks of the Far East Economic Conference</h3>
<p>The United Nations held the Far East Economic Conference in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. This is the first conference held by the United Nations in China outside of the United Nations. This conference is related to the future of China's construction. Its origins and tasks are something that all sectors want to know. The materials written by the International Publishing House are recorded for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>At its second session last June, the United Nations Social and Economic Council, upon the proposal of the US representative, established a "Temporary Subcommittee on Economic Construction in Damaged Areas" under the Economic and Employment Committee, one of the five committees under the Council. The proposal was unanimously adopted and stipulated that the following two points should be submitted to the next Council meeting:</p>
<p>(1) The nature and scope of economic construction problems in European and Asian countries affected by war.</p>
<p>(2) Progress of construction and international cooperation measures that can effectively facilitate and accelerate the construction of these countries.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to address economic construction problems by region, the Social and Economic Council authorized the subcommittee to work in two groups: one group for Europe and Africa, and one group for the Far East. The members are representatives from China, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia (Abyssinia), Greece, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. The French representative serves as the chairman, the Chinese representative as the vice-chairman, and the US representative as the reporter. The European group convened a meeting in London last July and established four field working teams to conduct regional investigations. The investigations have been completed, and a report has been submitted, recommending that the Council should establish a European Economic Commission. The Far East group was left to be considered after the Council's third meeting.</p>
<h3>The Process of Establishing the Far East Group</h3>
<p>On October 3rd last year, the Council continued to pass a resolution, requesting the United Nations Secretary-General to prepare background materials on the war damage and construction needs of various countries in Asia and the Far East, and to arrange for preliminary investigations in the relevant regions. This investigation was undertaken by the Asia and Far East Group. (The group had already met on August 9th).</p>
<p>The group originally planned to meet in Nanjing to study the materials prepared by the Secretariat and information obtained from preliminary field investigations and from various governments. It was also supposed to prepare a preliminary report for submission to the Council. However, due to the busy work of the Secretariat during the United Nations General Assembly, preliminary preparations for the meeting in Nanjing could not be made. Therefore, it was agreed to hold the meeting in New York in February this year in order to prepare the report.</p>
<p>At its 55th plenary meeting last December, the United Nations General Assembly recognized the urgent need for international cooperation in damaged areas and recommended that "in order to provide effective assistance to countries affected by war, the Social and Economic Council should give prompt and favorable consideration at its next meeting to the establishment of a European Economic Commission and an Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East."</p>
<p>The Asia and Far East Working Group met on February 14th this year for its second meeting. The first half of the meeting involved a broad discussion of the preliminary factual materials provided by the Secretariat, followed by a division into two subgroups: one group to review and supplement factual materials on war damage and construction progress in various countries, and the other group to conduct general analysis in order to make specific recommendations. The reports of the two subgroups were then combined into a general report, which was approved by the working group on March 7th and submitted to the Council.</p>
<h3>Economic Conditions of Asian Countries</h3>
<p>China</p>
<p>Nine million people died in action during the war, and the number of those who died from injuries or diseases was also extremely large. The number of people who died of starvation last year was quite alarming. Ninety percent of the machinery and light metal industry's productivity was destroyed in the war, as well as seventy percent of the coal, electricity, and steel industry's productivity, fifty-eight percent of the cotton textile industry, eighty percent of the wartime shipping industry, and sixty-five percent of the highways. The Shanghai cost of living index in November 1946 was more than 5,300 times higher than in 1937 (according to this May, it was 23,500 times higher).</p>
<p>Restoring the transportation system must precede everything else in China's economic construction. Cotton and textile machinery are also extremely needed in order to provide clothing for the people. Coal mines and electricity are urgently needed to help restore other industries. China's educational needs, such as university libraries, testing instruments, and trained technical personnel, all depend on foreign sources. Agricultural needs include fertilizers and cattle breeds. Medical supplies have been supplied in large quantities by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and U.S. surplus materials, but medical schools and hospitals are still in urgent need of medical supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>Vietnam</p>
<p>During the period of occupation, the country suffered severe war damage as a result of the war, enemy plunder, and the financial burden imposed by the occupying regime and military operations. The most important thing in the Viet Minh's economic construction is to provide the people with cotton cloth, restore transportation, and provide tools and electrical machinery. The Japanese in</p>
<p>Malaya</p>
<p>Massacred 100,000 people, so Malaya's greatest war loss was manpower. The Malays who survived the war suffered greatly from malnutrition and lack of medical treatment. The most urgent needs now are rice and clothing textiles. The long-term economic construction of Malaya must restore the rubber and tin industries. Singapore's special needs include food, clothing, housing, and harbor construction.</p>
<p>Siam</p>
<p>Because other Asian countries have a particularly strong demand for its exports, especially rice, its current economic situation is still good, but it is in great need of textiles and consumer goods, railway equipment, automobile transportation, and port facilities, because it was heavily bombed by the Allied forces during the war.</p>
<p>Hong Kong</p>
<p>The main obstacle to recovery is the shortage of rice and the inability to obtain consumer goods and raw materials at world prices.</p>
<p>Papua and New Guinea</p>
<p>Became a dramatic battlefield in the Pacific War. By the end of the war, all the houses had been destroyed, and the small boats connecting the islands had also been damaged. The entire economy must be rebuilt. The Australian government is responsible for building the economic life of New Guinea and Papua, and has announced that this construction will be part of a long-term plan to develop the region and improve the lives of its residents. 1946</p>
<p>Philippines</p>
<p>The national income was only two-thirds of what it was before the war, based on stable prices. Although the production of major food crops has gradually expanded, it is still necessary to import rice and other food crops. The reconstruction work has been delayed by the lack of clothing, medicine, livestock, fishing and agricultural equipment, and logging saw machines. The long-term economic construction of the Philippines requires the restoration of industries for export, which were originally the main source of income before the war. Industrial equipment is necessary to restore mining, the cigarette industry, fiber stripping, sugar extraction, oil extraction, and other industries. Assistance must also be provided in the areas of transportation, communications, housing, and education.</p>
<p>North Borneo</p>
<p>The major cities were heavily damaged by the war. In addition to houses, British Borneo is also in urgent need of rice and clothing. The people there sometimes have to use tree bark as clothing.</p>
<p>Burma</p>
<p>After its recovery, its economic life was completely disrupted and its industries were at a standstill. Because it was difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials and there was a lack of funds, the recovery work progressed very slowly. The disruption of the transportation system is the biggest obstacle to recovery. It will take five years for the important hardwood industry to recover, and the oil refineries have been completely destroyed. There will be no significant output until new equipment is reinstalled. The rice acreage before the war was 12 million acres, and half of it is now wasteland. It will take three or four years to restore cultivation.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>The "scorched earth policy" destroyed important industries such as oil, tin, navigation, and ports; rubber, tea, and coffee were all destroyed by the enemy and replaced with food crops. The transportation system and factories suffered severe damage. On the island of Java alone, it is estimated that about three million people were killed by the Japanese and died from hunger, disease, and lack of medical care. About one million on the outer islands combined.</p>

<h3>China Water Conservancy: The First Canal - 15th Anniversary of the Revival of the Jinghui Canal</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Chi, Xi'an, 15th (By Air)</p>
<p>Living in the restless and worried ancient city, I often think of the vast sea and the trickling streams. Water is the same, but several irrigation projects in Shaanxi Province are the lifelines in the minds of the farmers who live on yellow soil.</p>
<p>Glorious History</p>
<p>According to China's water conservancy literature, Shaanxi Province can be said to have the earliest water conservancy projects. Da Yu (although historians have not determined whether he existed) who was commemorated on Engineer's Day last Saturday, June 6th, struck Longmen and controlled the waters, all of which were done in Shaanxi. Later, there were records of Qin Dynasty leading water to irrigate fields and washing away alkaline soil to grow crops. Among them, the use of the Jing River was probably the earliest. As early as 240 BC, the Qin people used Han to build the Zheng Guo Canal to open the Jing River, and led the waters of Ye, Qing, Qi, and Ju into the Luo River, irrigating 45,000 hectares of land, called the "Zheng Guo Canal." This glorious early record also has an important place in the history of world water conservancy projects.</p>
<p>Digging a canal is difficult, but maintaining a canal is also not easy. The Zheng Guo Canal in the Qin Dynasty was gradually destroyed in the Han Dynasty due to water banks, and the river water was not completely diverted into the canal, and water conservancy declined day by day. In the second year of the Taishi period of the Han Dynasty, Zhao Zhongdafu Bai Gong rebuilt it and renamed it "Zheng Bai Canal." Later dynasties made revisions, such as the "Fengli Canal" in the Song Dynasty, the "Wang Yushi Canal" in the Yuan Dynasty, the "Guanghui Canal" in the Ming Dynasty, and the "Longdong Canal" in the Qing Dynasty. The names were changed, but in fact they were still partially using the "Zheng Bai Canal," but the number of irrigated acres varied. By the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, it was unfortunately silted up to the point where it could only irrigate 200 acres.</p>
<p>Prelude to Revival</p>
<p>The proposal to revive the Jing River water conservancy dates back to the great drought north of the Wei River in the ninth year of the Republic of China. At that time, local gentry wanted to use the remaining disaster relief funds to repeat the old view of the "Zheng Bai Canal." In the eleventh year, the modern "Da Yu" Yi Sheshi took office as the Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and actively carried it out, but it was ultimately blocked by the war. It was not until after the great famine in Shaanxi from the 17th to the 19th years of the Republic of China that work began. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, when the Shaanxi Bureau stabilized, Li once again presided over the province's water conservancy administration. He successively obtained the assistance of the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission, Zhu Ziqiao, and Yu Youren. The first phase of the project from the 19th year to the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China completed three main canals and completed the organization of existing branch canals. A grand naming and water release ceremony was held on June 20 of the same year, exactly fifteen years ago today. It is a pity that Li Yishe could not see the joy of the villagers along the canal with his own eyes. He lies quietly in the cemetery on the north bank of the North Main Canal, with the splashing water as his eternal companion! Without him, there would be no revival of the Jinghui Canal, and the Zheng Guo Canal more than 2,000 years ago would still be a historical relic.</p>
<p>This spring, Dr. Savanji came to Shaanxi to visit the Jinghui Canal and visited Li's tomb on the way. This devotee who had fought against the heavens and the earth for water all his life also lowered his head and wrote words of admiration.</p>
<p>From the 22nd to the 24th year of the Republic of China, the second phase of the project was continued, and the Jinghui Canal Administration Bureau was established, directly under the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, until noon.</p>
<p>Irrigation Area</p>
<p>The Jinghui Canal still occupies the position of "oldest brother" in Shaanxi's water conservancy projects. It is not only the oldest, but also has the widest irrigation area. The total irrigation area of the nine water canals that have been released in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi is about 2 million mu, of which the Jinghui Canal area accounts for two-fifths, that is, 820,000 mu (1946 statistics). The area covers parts of Sanyuan, Jingyang, Gaoling and Liquan, Lintong. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the irrigation area of this canal once reached a maximum record of 950,000 mu. The entire canal is divided into north and south main lines, and then divided into eight branch canals. The water flow direction is from west to east.</p>
<p>Production Statistics</p>
<p>It is not easy to see the benefits of this canal to the agricultural crops in the area from the statistical figures of the irrigation area alone. Here we may as well cite the statistics of last year: the planting area of wheat irrigated by this canal was 340,000 mu, with an output of 440,000 shi; the planting area of miscellaneous grains (ie, corn, soybeans and others) was 140,000 mu, with an output of 170,000 shi, for a total of 610,000 shi of food. The planting area of cotton was 300,000 mu, with an output of 200,000 dan. By the way: last year's statistics were affected by other factors, and the harvest was not ideal. The highest record of crops in the Jinghui Canal area in the past 15 years was in the 28th year of the Republic of China, with a food harvest of 1.1 million shi, which is almost double last year's figure; another 280,000 dan of cotton, which is 40% higher than last year. As for the increase in yield per unit area, according to the general statistics of this province: the increase in cotton planting after canal irrigation is 100% (dry land yields about 30 jin of cotton per mu, while the irrigated area of the water canal yields 60 jin), and the increase in wheat planting is 60% (that is, dry land yields 1 shi of wheat per mu, while the irrigated area of the water canal yields 1 shi and 6 dou).</p>
<p>Maintaining a Canal is Not Easy</p>
<p>Digging a canal is difficult, but maintaining a canal is also not easy. The vicissitudes of the Jing River water conservancy for more than 2,000 years are excellent proof. From a positive point of view, developing new canals is certainly important, but from a negative point of view, how to ensure that the irrigation area continues to maintain a high quantity, so that the channels are not blocked and the water flow is reduced, is equally difficult. Before the 34th year of the Republic of China, the management expenses and staff food of the canals in Shaanxi Province were all borne by the national treasury, but since last year, except for very few subsidies, almost all of them have been raised by the local area. Under this circumstance, the provincial government had to use "using the canal to support the canal" to maintain it. In other words, the expenses for repairing and managing the canal should be borne equally by the farmers in the benefited fields along the canal. In the provincial assembly last month, someone criticized that the "small water fee" has increased the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>On the one hand, planning the supply and continued supply of water, and on the other hand, considering how to reduce the burden on rural farmers to the minimum extent, should be a theme of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Conference held in Xi'an on the 25th of this month, not just the Jinghui Canal alone.</p>

<h3>Lamartine's Autobiographical Novel</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Book Title: Graziella Author: Lamartine (French) Translator: Lu Publisher: Cultural Life Publishing House</p>
<p>An eighteen-year-old youth leaves France and travels to the warm and lovely South. Later, he arrives in Naples, Italy, and resides there for several months. It is early summer, and Mount Vesuvius, Castellammare fountains, and the azure sea, blue sky, and white clouds along the Bay of Naples bring this precocious French youth many melancholy smiles and smiling melancholy. He and a friend who is two years older spend their days in a boat, beside the sail, under the sky, and on the sea, mixing reality and fantasy, spending splendid and warm nights and long days, enjoying the wonders of nature.</p>
<p>They meet a fisherman from Procida, an old man named Andrea and his twelve-year-old grandson, Beppino, who own a colorful little boat with a small statue of Saint Francis embedded in the stern. The two young men often ask Andrea to let them be apprentice oarsmen on the boat. Bay after bay, reef after reef, time flows in the sound of the sea waves, flowing, flowing... September begins with thunder and rain.</p>
<p>That time, the sea became unsettled, and the fragile boat struggled against the violent waves, the lives of the four people struggling between life and death. In the end, they had to throw everything in the cabin into the sea: water bottles, fish baskets, sails, anchors, ropes, clothing bags, and luggage were all sacrificed, but they finally reached the cliffs of Procida safely. Because the wind was strong that night, the boat was also damaged.</p>
<p>In a small house near the shore of the island lived Andrea's wife, their granddaughter—Graziella, who was the little sailor Beppino's sister, and two younger children, his brothers.</p>
<p>One evening, Graziella listened to the younger of the two youths tell the story of "Paul and Virginia." This simple girl was moved and found herself in the soul of Virginia. When the story was finished, the dying lamp went out unnoticed, and she shed many tears of emotion. Was this the first time she knew sorrow? The first time she knew love?</p>
<p>After a few good days, they all left Procida. Andrea's whole family moved to Mezzogiorno and would not return until winter. The two young men also returned to their residence in Naples. —At this time, the elder one had returned to France because his sister had been betrothed, leaving only the eighteen-year-old, alone in Naples. Why didn't he return home with his friend? Was it the life at sea, the fisherman's hut, and the image of Graziella that captivated him?</p>
<p>Eventually, he fell ill, haggard and pale, with an unnamed melancholy. Graziella heard the news and rushed from Mezzogiorno to take care of him with heartfelt devotion and lent him a small silver icon. The next day, he woke up and was cured. Ignoring his weak body, he took a carriage to Mezzogiorno. Andrea's family welcomed him warmly and invited him to stay again.</p>
<p>From late autumn to early winter, the sky in Naples was so clear and beautiful, Graziella's skills and appearance became more and more outstanding, and his heart felt such sweet rest and peaceful sweetness. But he never admitted, or even thought, that he had fallen in love with this beautiful island girl. She was a lovely companion, a good friend, like a close sister; he never thought of anything else. Until one day, on the eve of Christmas, Ciauzo's father came to ask for her hand in marriage for his son. Andrea and his wife were happy for their granddaughter's happy future, but Graziella was unhappy. At first, they thought it was just a girl's shyness and that she would calm down after a while. The French youth staying there suddenly realized in a moment that his feelings for Graziella were not pure and frank friendship, but strong love. His heart was agitated, his spirit was uneasy, his whole heart trembled, he was sleepless all night, and like a fool, he left Andrea's thatched cottage. After New Year's Day, he went to Mezzogiorno again and found that everything had changed greatly. Graziella cried all day, did not work, and locked herself in the house, not seeing anyone. Ciauzo's father was waiting for a reply every day, but she was unwilling, unwilling. Finally, that evening, she was overwhelmed by her grandparents' request and Ciauzo's tears and accepted her cousin's ring. That evening, he returned, heard the news, and felt a chill. He walked and talked in front of her door, but she was still silent, speechless, and invisible. He had no choice but to go to sleep as well.</p>
<p>There was a storm that night, but the early morning was a clear and bright winter morning. Graziella was gone, leaving her clothes and money for her family; her small silver icon and a pomegranate flower she had worn for the French youth; the ring was returned to her cousin; and a note saying that she would rather be a nun than agree to the marriage.</p>
<p>Ciauzo relented, and the family only hoped for her return, mentioning nothing else, so scouts were sent out to search, search. Finally, in the old house in Procida, the French youth found Graziella, who had been deformed by passion. After this poor girl gradually regained her vitality, the veil of her soul was lifted, and she finally told him "she loved him"!</p>
<p>Graziella was more beautiful than before, but her long eyelashes hid sorrow in her big eyes. Love can make people beautiful, but it can also make people melancholy. She understood that their paradise was built in the clouds. How could a girl from a Neapolitan island and a wealthy French youth be together forever!</p>
<p>On a night at the end of May, his mother asked someone to hire horses and urged him to leave immediately, allowing no hesitation. On the moonlit terrace, Graziella fainted. It was a difficult farewell, also a permanent farewell.</p>
<p>Back in France, he initially received letters from her, but later she fell ill and gradually there was no news. He missed her all the time, but after all, he was too young, at the age of infidelity. For fear of vicious ridicule and vain irony, he abandoned this sacred love in the sand. Winter came, and he did not fulfill his promise to go to Naples, although he never forgot Graziella. On a night in early December, he received a note brought by an unknown traveler. —Graziella is dead?</p>
<p>This is the story of Graziella, and also Lamartine's first love. Lamartine was a French writer of the nineteenth century. Graziella is said to have been a real person, but not the Coral Girl, but a female worker in a cigarette factory in Naples. Lamartine traveled to Italy in 1811. He had several romances in his life and married an English girl in 1819, with great happiness. But the image of the poor Graziella could never be forgotten in his memory. The first seeds are the hardest to pull out. One evening in 1830, in a church in Paris, he saw a coffin containing a young girl being carried in, covered with a white cloth. He thought of Graziella, shed tears, and unfolded the memories written in long accumulations, writing a long poem "First Mourning" to confess his infidelity and ruthlessness at the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>"Graziella" may not be a masterpiece in French literature, but we cannot deny that in the author's memory, it is like a light on a lone boat in the dark night, becoming brighter and brighter in the distant places where no one lives. Everyone's first sorrow will be the most beautiful and precious bud in their own garden of emotions. Romain Rolland once said: "...That is something that the torrent of life cannot wash away. In the bottom of everyone's heart, there is a tomb where loved ones are buried. They sleep in it for years and years, and nothing disturbs them. But one day—we know—the cellar will reopen. The dead will come out of the tomb, and faded lips will smile sweetly at their lovers; their past is hidden in their lovers' hearts, like a child lying in the belly of the sea..." It was on this day that Lamartine's tomb was opened when the story of "Graziella" was written.</p>
<p>Who has seen an old woman with white hair, how she quietly opens the dusty treasure box in her lonely room? Inside, there are many pearl, jade, and amber ornaments locked away, as well as those invisible youth and years of yesterday. Just like the old woman's treasure box, this book also locks away many confessions, happiness, memories, and many smiles and many tears.</p>
<h3>Reading Franklin's Biography</h3>
<p>— Ai Wen</p>
<p>Book Title: Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Author: Carl Van Doren</p>
<p>Publisher: Overseas Editions, Inc, New York</p>
<p>As a child, I read about Franklin's life in the national language textbook, and I already had an impression of this great man in my mind. In middle school, I also read his autobiography (Franklin's Autobiography), and I was very amazed by his hard work and self-improvement. Unfortunately, the book was incomplete, and his achievements in society and science were not described in detail, which I deeply regretted. Today, after reading Doren's biography of Franklin, I feel relieved.</p>
<p>"Another ship arrived from London with news of Franklin's arrival nine days later. Philadelphia waited in constant turmoil... The bell rang as he stepped onto the street... More than a week of continuous ceremonies to welcome him. The people gave him little time to rest..." (page 464). How great was Franklin, who handled diplomacy in France, assisted in the revolution, and returned home triumphantly, stepping on his homeland ravaged by the British!</p>
<p>How Franklin reached this position is what we want to read on; from an apprentice in a small printing shop to a newspaper manager, to a postmaster, to an ambassador, and finally to a chief executive. On the other hand, he only studied for two years and became a scholar, scientist, writer, philosopher, and politician known throughout the world. During this period, he experienced many changes in the world, but he remained steadfast and not abandoned by the trend, with opinions and insights. He did not take a wrong step. This is not accidental or lucky; it is the result of a consistent combination of superb cultivation and practical action. His autobiography tells us how he tempered himself, and Dow's book tells us how he applied it. Especially on the eve of supporting the revolution (pages 275-333).</p>
<p>Franklin's life is a great history, as Dow said on the last page of the book: "...Franklin was not like those who were guilty of becoming great opportunities. In any year, in any place, Franklin would have become a great man. Thought and will, talent and skill, strength and quiet, wisdom and elegance gathered in him as if nature had indulged but liked his creation. Nothing seemed to be missing except the passionate desire, like some of the smartest people; all rulers, soldiers, saints, poets, scholars, and those with a talent or advantage or success. Franklin was from beginning to end in a docile balance..."</p>
<p>Dow's work is an epic of "history." His achievements do not need my eloquent explanation. The book won the American Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1939. The writing is concise and vivid, and although it is complicated, it is not annoying. The material is extensive, and there are many citations; as the introduction on the cover of the book says: "It is commendable that Mr. Doron has continued this work. Many materials have not been discovered by the public, and many known ones have been simplified and given a new analysis on the most reliable side. In truth, Franklin's autobiography is completed here and now at his own level and in his own words. ——" The only regret is that the book lacks a literary atmosphere, but this is not enough to be a problem and does not detract from its value.</p>
<p>At this moment, I think that young people, young people, and even old people have an obligation to read this book. Especially those who are younger, because this book can guide you in everything in your life, knowledge path, and moral training.</p>

<h3>Geography of Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Zhen Fan</p>
<p>Author: Song Jiatai Publisher: Zhengzhong Bookstore</p>
<p>Victory is almost two years away: However, there are not many books published on the subject of Taiwan, and there are even fewer with achievements. In terms of the geography of Taiwan, the ones issued in the market are either pamphlets or parts of guides. Only Zhengzhong Bookstore has published a special book with in-depth and unique insights, "Geography of Taiwan" by Song Jiatai.</p>
<p>The content of the book is limited to the island of Taiwan and nearby islands such as Ryukyu and Penghu, and is divided into eleven chapters. The first chapter is an overview, describing the geographical characteristics of Taiwan: such as the narrow and long shape, the location of the land and islands, the mountainous terrain, the straight coastline, the tropical climate, the abundant products, the prosperous population, and the developed transportation. The second chapter is about topography and structure, describing mountains and their structure, plains and rivers, and coastlines. The third chapter is about climate and plants, describing Taiwan's temperature, rainfall, air pressure and wind, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, alpine climate, and natural plants. The fourth chapter is about agriculture (with aquaculture). The content of this chapter is the best, because agricultural economy is the economic foundation of Taiwan, so the information about agriculture and agricultural products is as detailed as possible, such as the number of cultivated land areas, the number of farm households, and the agricultural population over the years, as well as the cultivation area and yield of rice, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, tea, etc., which are all data for our research on Taiwan's agriculture. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth chapters are divided into forest products, mineral products, industry, transportation, trade, and residents. The eleventh chapter is about cities, detailing the distribution of cities and Taiwan's nine major cities—Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Keelung, Chiayi, Taichung, Hsinchu, Changhua, and Pingtung. It also includes the Penghu Islands and other islands, such as Ryukyu, Hongtouyu, Huoshaodao, Xiaohongtouyu, and Guishan Island.</p>
<p>The book has a total of 172 pages, and the collection of charts and tables is abundant. Among them, the east-west cross-section map of Taiwan's topography, geological map, temperature map, rainfall map, climate element map, industrial structure map, agriculture, forestry, and expansion resource map, and population distribution map are especially difficult to see.</p>
<p>Taiwan is the largest island in my country's coast, connected to the Ryukyu Islands in the north, facing the Pacific Ocean in the east, and facing Luzon Island across the Bashi Channel in the south. It has both the advantages of the mainland and the ocean, and its location can be said to be superior. During the 50 years of Japanese occupation, it actively built mines, cities were lined up, and railways were densely distributed, making it leap into a wealthy and prosperous area, which the Japanese regarded as a treasure trove. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, Taiwan, which has been ravaged by Japan for 50 years, has returned to the embrace of the motherland, which is so important to my country's political and economic future. Without considering my own triviality, I will introduce a relatively complete geography book, which may not be controversial to the public.</p>
<h3>Basic Issues of Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Na Ya</p>
<p>(Written by Donick, translated by Ji Minzhi, published by Wenguang Bookstore)</p>
<p>"Great art first requires artists to have lofty and great ideals and personalities, and requires them to have the spirit of hard struggle."</p>
<p>This sentence is correct. No matter what kind of art, it will never succeed without the "spirit of hard struggle."</p>
<p>Regarding literature and art, this is what most intellectual youths are paying attention to at the moment, but many youths do not have a clear understanding of the basic issues of literature and art, and only have a vague understanding of a little bit. Some people often read literary works, but they cannot avoid this kind of vague phenomenon regarding the basic issues of literature and art.</p>
<p>In this small book, it will eliminate this vague concept of young people.</p>
<p>In this book, the basic issues of literature and art are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>1. Aesthetics and the objects it studies. It explains that the task of aesthetics is to study the essence of art as a reflection of human understanding, its general laws of development, the treasure house of everything interconnected in nature and society, all kinds of human activities, and the creative reproduction in the images of human emotions, thoughts, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it talks about the sociality and historicity of aesthetics: it not only lies in determining the relationship between works of art and certain social forms, but also clarifies the objective artistic significance of these works. In the process of the historical development of society and the historical development of people's productive activities, not only did artistic perceptions change, but art itself, the real artistic feelings, and the understanding of basic aesthetic categories also changed.</p>
<p>2. Artistic Characteristics and Content: It explains that art itself includes four basic interacting mechanisms: (1) the unity of typicality and individuality; (2) the unity of form and content; (3) the characteristics of artistic concreteness; (4) the characteristics of artistic fantasy.</p>
<p>Secondly, it talks about beauty in art: art and any kind of artistic activity are themselves "according to the laws of beauty"; thereby explaining in detail this "law of beauty."</p>
<p>3. What is sublimation? Seeking to achieve the realm of sublimation through the opposition between the ugly forms of expression and the inner beauty and goodness of the spiritual life hidden behind the forms of expression.</p>
<p>4. Tragedy: The inevitable conflict of the worldwide historical forces that are engaged in struggle and inevitably tend to destruction constitutes the basis of tragedy.</p>
<p>5. Comedy: It is an artistic depiction of comedy in reality.</p>
<p>Finally, this book explains the people's nature of literature and art and the new realism.</p>
<p>Looking at these contents, it does make a clear and definite answer to the basic issues of literature and art. Young people who love literature and art and want to understand these issues may wish to read this book.</p>

<h3>Supernatural Senses in Nature</h3>
<p>— Guo Yongnian</p>
<p>Although humans are naturally endowed with various perceptual advantages, many sensory sensitivities are still inferior to the superior skills possessed by animals. For example, in terms of the sense of "time": If you haven't looked at a clock for several hours, try to guess what time it is? Then check with the clock's accurate time, did you guess wrong by half an hour? Or a quarter of an hour? On this point, a small bee is much better than us. British scientists have done such precise experiments: providing food to bees flying from a distance at a fixed time every day, and these bees never miss the arrival time by more than five minutes! This makes us people with clocks a little ashamed. For another example, when drinking coffee, put in a spoonful of sugar. If you put too little, you won't feel the sweetness. According to experiments, the degree to which we humans feel sweetness is one in two hundred (that is, at least one part of sugar needs to be mixed into two hundred parts of the same amount of liquid to feel its sweetness). However, flies can feel one part of sugar in 40,000 parts; but bees can detect the sweetness of one part of sugar in 300,000 parts.</p>
<p>For another example, in terms of changes in ambient temperature, at least the thermometer needs to go up and down several degrees before humans can feel it, which is much more sensitive and sharp in wild animals. Scientists at the American Museum of Natural Sciences placed two light bulbs of the same shape but different degrees of ripeness in front of a rattlesnake. Each time the temperature of the two bulbs was changed, the rattlesnake always pounced on the light bulb with the higher temperature. Each time the temperature difference was reduced, and finally the two bulbs differed by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius, the snake could still detect it.</p>
<p>For example, in terms of hearing, animal psychologists have tested ordinary dogs and found that they can hear the ticking of a watch placed forty feet away, but the person with the sharpest hearing can hardly hear it four feet away. Ornithologists have found that when robins are jumping on the grass, they often tilt their heads and to the ground to listen for the movement of earthworms underground in order to find food.</p>
<p>In other cases, such as the central line on the side of fish, which can feel the pressure of water; the reason why bees can fly back and forth quickly in flower bushes at a high speed is by relying on ultraviolet rays that are invisible to the human eye to guide them; the loach can quickly swim upstream in the dark without accidentally hitting rocks; even the smallest snail, if its eyeballs are cut off, it can still feel the light or shadows passing over its body.</p>
<h3>Standards of Election – A Story of the Kazakhs, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Pu Yuan</p>
<p>Zheng Fanggu, the leader of the Qinghai Children’s Theatre Troupe, who Chairman Ma sent to accompany us, not only loves Kazakh folk songs, but also adapts many stories of the War of Resistance against Japan. He incorporates many Uyghur, Tibetan, and Kazakh songs, and presents them in performances by his Qinghai Children’s Theatre Troupe, giving everyone who has seen these small operas a good impression of the minority compatriots on the frontier.</p>
<p>We often see some Kazakhs in Xining City and find their manner of puffing out their chests, sticking out their buttocks, and walking with clumsy, waddling steps to be quite foolish. But, according to Mr. Zheng, this posture precisely proves that they are accustomed to life on horseback. "Once they are on horseback," Mr. Zheng said, "their spirits immediately revive, and they truly embody the heroes we imagine."</p>
<p>Generally speaking, they are good and kind, but in desperate situations, they can become very cruel. "There was such a case," Mr. Zheng said, "three close Kazakh friends were walking together, and they became incredibly hungry on the road, unable to find anything to eat. So, the other two conspired and ate the third person. Later, the remaining two gave one of their friends to eat – don't laugh, this is true, they originally ate raw meat!"</p>
<p>"They have a custom," Mr. Zheng said, "the Kazakhs who remain within Chinese territory are also divided into many small tribes, hidden in the mountains. However, each small tribe has a leader, and this leader is elected. Perhaps it is an elderly, middle-aged, or young person. The standard for election depends on the number of bird feathers on each person's hat. The one with the most feathers is elected, and these feathers are signs of killing; each time a person is killed, a feather is added!"</p>
<p>In the Northwest, the fastest running animal among wild beasts is the gazelle, and the Kazakhs on horseback can easily catch up with them, whether on the plains, in the grasslands, in the desert, or in the mountains, and capture them. Their livelihood comes from hunting. In recent years, they mostly live by robbery. "Aren't traveling merchants in the Northwest accustomed to walking in large groups?" Mr. Zheng said, "The main reason is still fear of the Kazakhs; they will rob as soon as they encounter resistance."</p>
<h3>The Riddle of Salted Eggs</h3>
<p>— Ning Po</p>
<p>Mr. Mills, an American professor at a certain university in the old capital, loves to eat Chinese salted duck eggs. He once told a joke: "Once upon a time, an American who had just arrived in China was very fond of the taste of Chinese salted eggs. At the time, he was very suspicious of how the eggs were salted. He carefully examined the eggshell, which was intact and unbroken. How could the salt enter? How could the taste be salty? He kept this question to himself, unable to find an answer, and remained silent, waiting. One day, he was invited to a banquet by a Chinese friend, and the cook brought in a whole salted duck. He suddenly understood and said: 'So there are salted ducks in China. No wonder they lay salted eggs!'"</p>
<p>Screen Chat</p>
<h3>"The Lost Weekend"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>"The Lost Weekend" was the champion of the top ten films of 1946. Ray Milland won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this film. This novel has been a bestseller in the United States in recent years, perhaps because such a popular novel was adapted for the screen.</p>
<p>This story is very simple, depicting a young man engaged in writing who, due to many difficulties in his career, indulges in drunkenness all day long, throwing all his time and money into bars, and finally reaching the brink of ruin, about to fall into an irreparable situation. Later, thanks to the repeated encouragement of his lover, he realized his future and broke away from alcohol.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to different national characteristics, prohibition in the West is a serious matter, and riots have occurred because of it. In our country, alcohol does not seem to be a serious matter. Therefore, "The Lost Weekend" can win the championship of the top ten films in Hollywood, but in our eyes, it is not an outstanding masterpiece.</p>
<p>Even from the perspective of the script's content, the author did not strongly explain why the male protagonist, Don, could not develop in his career, how a young man engaged in cultural work is suppressed in a capitalist society, and how frustration leads him to a perverted life. In such a situation, the encouragement of a girlfriend based on her love is probably still not enough to completely resolve the frustration that Don feels.</p>
<p>— However, the author does not seem to focus on these aspects. He only aims to persuade people to do good and not waste their precious time in drunkenness. Originally, one cannot demand too much from Hollywood scripts.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning Ray Milland's acting skills. He subtly and profoundly portrays the psychological process of Don, the drunkard. Several scenes, such as those in the bar with the bat hallucinations, are highly rewarding in terms of acting. Almost the entire film is his solo performance. In addition, Don's lover and the owner of the bar both performed the characters' personalities very competently.</p>
<p>The directing and cinematography are both above standard.</p>
<h3>Sympathy for Postal Rate Increases</h3>
<p>— Hei Zi</p>
<p>Because of the abolition of subsidy policies, state-owned enterprises are now raising prices one after another. The government's abolition of subsidy policies this time is very reasonable. We are not opposed to subsidy policies, but if it is only a partial subsidy, especially subsidies for public utilities in certain large cities, then it is worth studying. Because using the national treasury to bear the subsidies for specific areas is equivalent to all citizens bearing the costs for a portion of the people to enjoy, which is quite inappropriate.</p>
<p>According to reports, postal rates will soon increase, raising them by 500 percent. We sympathize greatly with this. This is not because I, the author, can watch the price increase competition from across the river, nor is it because the post office is constantly innovating and its spirit and efficiency are commendable. Rather, it is to reduce the burden on the national treasury, which is to say, to reduce the burden on the people. Indeed, the post office is the most public enterprise, and everyone has some dealings with the post office. However, the most frequent dealings are with merchants, the same as with telegrams. They rely on these two to communicate business information, connect markets, and negotiate transactions. As for parcel delivery, the commercial sector also sends the most and the largest parcels. If they send items with low postal rates and delivery fees, and the government bears the huge difference, it is truly like asking the people to bear a large portion of the postal rates and delivery fees for merchants, which is so unreasonable. Therefore, I fully sympathize with and support the postal authorities' move to abolish subsidies and implement price increases.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also sympathize with the increase in telegram prices, and I also support the government's abolition of subsidies for the telecommunications bureau. I feel that this can reduce, rather than increase, the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Consanguineous Marriage</h3>
<p>— Xi Pan Shi</p>
<p>I often hear or witness many married couples who are related to each other by blood, and their offspring are almost always disabled or have developmental abnormalities. However, when their descendants grow up and marry others, the children they have mostly inherit the bad qualities of their parents. For example, according to Benis's survey, among thirty consanguineous marriages, their descendants totaled 3,942 people. Those with limb disabilities accounted for 28.7 percent, the deaf and mute accounted for 3.6 percent, the blind accounted for 2.1 percent, those with developmental abnormalities accounted for 2.4 percent, those with epilepsy accounted for 7.5 percent, those with scrofula accounted for 7.6 percent, those who died young accounted for 22 percent, and those who were healthy accounted for 24 percent. If this continues, their future descendants will certainly not be of good quality. To avoid this situation, in a proactive sense, men and women who are not yet married must investigate in advance whether the other party's qualities are good, and never enter into consanguineous marriages. In a passive sense, those who suffer from various diseases should be prevented from reproducing.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Zuo Zongtang</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>Reading the history of the Qing Dynasty, in the first year of Guangxu (1877 AD), Zuo Zongtang stood alone against all opinions on the issue of the Xinjiang Hui rebellion. His memorial to the throne stated: "Reclaiming Xinjiang is to protect Mongolia; protecting Mongolia is to defend the capital. The Russians are expanding their territory day by day, stretching over ten thousand li from west to east, connected to our northern border, with only Mongolia in the middle. It is best to remove the firewood quickly and take precautions before a fire starts." He also said: "I am but a scholar, having reached the highest rank of minister. I am already sixty-five years old this year, how dare I greedily claim credit? However, since Ili has been taken by Russia (1871 – the tenth year of Tongzhi, Russia, fearing that Yaqub Beg's newly emerging forces would occupy Ili, occupied the capital of Ili, Huiyuan City, under the pretext of protecting its borders, until the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1881, when the issue of the return of Ili was resolved), and Yaqub Beg has also occupied Kashgar, if we ignore it, we will inevitably lose ground day by day, and the future consequences are unimaginable."</p>
<p>At that time, Zuo Zongtang was the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu, and the Hui rebellion in Gansu had not yet been quelled. The Qing government's military campaign in Xinjiang cost more than ten million taels of military expenses annually, and the treasury was depleted. Some people advocated abandoning the eight southern cities of Xinjiang and granting Yaqub Beg the title of a vassal prince. Moreover, Yaqub Beg had considerable political skills, having negotiated with Turkish and other Muslim countries, and signed commercial treaties with Britain and Russia. The British envoy Thomas Wade also repeatedly suggested to the Qing court that Yaqub Beg be granted the title of a vassal prince. Under these circumstances, Zuo Zongtang resolutely wished to send troops to the west and pacified all of Xinjiang in 1878. We history readers break out in a cold sweat for his risky actions, and his spirit of old age and strength truly inspires admiration in later generations.</p>
<p>If Zuo Zongtang had not launched the western expedition and had allowed Yaqub Beg to become a vassal, (according to historical records, Yaqub Beg's governance of the region was characterized by a complete police force, and there were almost no criminal incidents among the people), then the Xinjiang region would certainly have ceased to be ours long ago, and Qinghai, Gansu, and other places would probably have faced problems as well.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>Upon arriving outside the station, he first inquired among the villagers living in the huts about any possible means of transportation. The result was nothing, unless he hired someone to carry Fei Fei on their back, but Fei Fei firmly refused. Finally, Lao Zhu asked an old man for directions to the nearest route to Nandan, bought a few pieces of wheat-based dry food that resembled biscuits but were not, and then resolutely set off on the gray-black dirt road in the fading twilight.</p>
<p>Initially, Fei Fei was very quiet, not crying or complaining of a headache. After Lao Zhu walked about five kilometers, he stopped, sat down on a large rock to rest, and took her off his back, letting her drink half of the small bottle of boiled water he had filled at the station. She said nothing and fell asleep in Lao Zhu's arms. For her sake, Lao Zhu deliberately sat for a while longer, feeling a little relieved. He took out a flashlight and six or seven butter candies that he had been hoarding from his small suitcase, but only ate one, feeling that it was not as sweet as usual, and put the rest back into the suitcase.</p>
<p>At this time, the short hand on his watch had passed eight o'clock. Lao Zhu looked up at the blue-gray sky with stars but no moon, and tested the temperature on Fei Fei's forehead. He really felt that he could not delay any longer. He gently woke Fei Fei, let her be carried on his back as before, and wrapped her securely with a cloth.</p>
<p>Fei Fei rubbed her tired eyes and reluctantly complied, but after walking a very short distance, she began to groan. Lao Zhu turned back to comfort her, but she just sobbed and kept crying of a headache. At first, Lao Zhu thought it was because the child wanted to sleep but couldn't, so she was making a fuss. But after another thirty or forty yards, his back told him that Fei Fei was not only making a fuss, she was crying, and her body was twisting violently.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian, who had no experience in taking care of children, was at a loss. He hurriedly unbuttoned his chest buttons, loosened the cloth, and suddenly put Fei Fei down. At this time, the child's legs had no strength, and she couldn't even stand for a minute. By the time Lao Zhu turned around, she had collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>"Fei Fei! Fei Fei!" Lao Zhu called out as he hurriedly hugged her. He knelt on the ground with both knees.</p>
<p>Fei Fei only groaned, her head and neck constantly arching backward, her eyeballs rolling upwards, as if she were about to faint. Lao Zhu tried hard to calm himself, pulled over the small suitcase that had fallen to the side, and groped for the water bottle and the small glass tube containing the only remaining piece of Da Jian Phoenix medicine.</p>
<p>"Fei Fei, drink water, drinking some water will make you feel better!" He used great effort to crush the pill and stuff it into Fei Fei's lips. But as soon as he poured in a mouthful of water, Fei Fei suddenly vomited, spitting out both the medicine and the water.</p>
