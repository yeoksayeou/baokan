<p>〔本報濟南十八日電〕替代臨沂中區於沂水西北新莊興建之共產黨東最大根據地，已次第完成，據確息：共產黨於去冬十一月蘇北戰事吃緊時，即征調民夫三千餘人，於沂水西北約四十公里摩天嶺麓之新莊，利用該地有利地形，蓋造大批房舍，現此項建築已大部竣工，所有共產黨華東局，偽山東省府及山東軍區重要人物及檔卷，多已運抵該地，臨沂之偽山東大學，亦遷往繼續上課，大衆日報亦移該地出版。</p>

<h3>青年黨參加政府名單　今開中常會決定　邵力子在滬時曾與董必武晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨夜青年黨在滬各常委，假左舜生公館召開談話會，就參加政府名單問題交換意見，以為今日中常會之凖備。記者昨訪左氏，據云：在京時曾與吳鐵城陳立夫等晤談，均希望改組政府能早日實現，靑年黨對改組政府之意見一如往日，即主張中央全盤改組及開放地方政權，政府對此原則上均表同意。一俟名單決定後，當再度晋京。按左氏與陳啟天，係十八日量目京抵滬者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕改紙政府問題即將逐步展開，民社黨所提之名單，雖僅限於四機構，惟蔣勻田十七日謁主席時，主席曾就全部改組事與蔣氏有所洽談。據雷震語記者：靑年黨之名單，須於十九日該然中常會中決定，廿日可能携京。民社黨名單當待靑年黨名單提出後，一併公佈。改組政府亦即可按步進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕邵力子十七日自滬返京，聞在滬曾晤董必武。京中傳邵董之會，與和談重開有關，惟共產黨發言人梅益，今晚向記者否認此說。又中共聯絡處撤退問題，據梅益表示，如政府無此表示，該處將仍留京滬。</p>
<h3>司使後日來滬　即轉粵港訪問</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京十八日電〕美駐華大使司徒雷登博士，將於廿一日下午啟程前往上海·廣州·香港及海南島等處，作十日之旅行。司使將首先飛往上海，在滬渡週末。渠將於星期五晚應美總領事台維斯之邀宴，星期六晚在上海美國大學總會與上海留美學生協會，中美文化關係研究社及美國大學婦女協會等合作主持之華盛頓誕辰慶祝會中發表演說。星期一上午飛往廣州，在該處留居四天；廿八日飛香港，三月三日飛往海南島略事勾留後，次日即返京。</p>
<h3>經濟方案　送交立院</h3>
<p>即可完成立法程序</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕經濟緊急措施方案，已於十八日由國府送交立院，俾於最短期內完成立法程序。立院刑法財經等委會，定十九日開會審查。</p>
<h3>實物配給準備就緒印花即可開始</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕公敎人員生活必需品供應細則，頃已擬成，將俟由部呈政院後短期內公布。該部將不專設機構辦理，而與有關機關如糧部·社部·物次供應局·資委會·財部·警廳等俁組首都公敎人員生活必需品配售委會，設主委一人，委員九人，下設秘書處分設若干組。銷售辦法分兩種：（一）承銷者交商業同業公會之各有關會員承銷；（二）配售則由首都合作社，交各分社配售；配售各物經部負責布匹·食油·煤，糧部負責米麵，資委會負責糖，財部負責鹽。各物儲量大多均有掌握，惟煤較困難。其售價則由該會擬定後呈政院核定。即使高價購進，亦決以低價售出。其賠補款項由國庫支付。據經部管制司司長龍大均談，配售問題全部準備妥定，僅在手續上應用之印花目前尙未印就，一經印就，即可開始。三月內決可如期開始。又滬方亦已準備就緒，其組織與京市大致相同。</p>
<h3>我緊急經濟措施　美朝野一致稱譽</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十七日電〕全美各報今日皆以對蔣主席之緊急經濟措施，視為最重要之新聞。紐的時報今日第一版之標題為「中國重採戰時管制法，以防止通貨膨漲。」世界電訊報稱：「蔣主席刷新中國之經濟」，但各報尙未有評論評述此事。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕權威方面稱，美官方對最近蔣主席之經濟緊急措施，並未掩飾其表示同情之情緒。蔣主席之緊急措置，無疑已博得美國朝野觀察家之同情。但輿論方面仍懷疑中國政府之機構在實施此項經濟緊急方案時，能否勝任愉快。保守派之明星晚報對此首加評論稱「美國之放棄調解工作，乃最近法幣貶值之主要因素。」該報幷稱，中國之經濟不安對中國共產黨頗為有利，共產黨對其控制不到之地區，素以促成經濟崩潰為目的，馬歇爾特使在離華前所發表之聲明中曾加以抨擊。</p>
<p>另據本社探詢所得，由於蔣主席此項緊急措置，國會方面人士，對於中國之認識更趨堅定，對國民政府之同情亦有增無已，國會方面對國民黨少數反動份子，雖仍有惡感，但覺美國決不能聽任中國之赤化，更不能聽任國民黨政府之消亡。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十七日電〕此間商界本日對蔣主席所頒布之經濟緊急措施方案，一致譽為確切之步驟。商業領袖談：彼等認為該方案並無妨碍進出口商人之處，如能實施，則大部份條例均極有裨益。商界領袖對取消出口補助費及百分之五十之進口附加費一事，允表讚許，認為此舉又使國外貿易恢復數週前之地位。蓋自出口補助費頒布以後，美國進口商即囑令在華代理人暫停一切業務。商界領袖幷稱，此項經濟新措施，乃中國多年來之最澈底辦法，並不以削足適履為能事。</p>
<h3>國防會今日例會　討論行憲各法規　立法院新增委員五十名</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕國防最高委員會定於十九日舉行例會，討論有關行之各項法規。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕立院機構即擴大，新增立委達五十人，佔現數二分之一。政院近撥三億元予立院，俾購各種必要用具。</p>
<h3>政院例會昨停開</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕政院例會因宋·翁兩院長及各部會長官多在滬，故停開。</p>
<h3>新運十三週年紀念　主席告全國同胞書</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕新生活運動十三週年紀念日，蔣主席吿全國同胞書，全文如次：</p>
<p>中正倡導新生活運動，迄今已歷十有三年；新生活運動之眞諦，實欲喚起我國民之自覺，改造我社會，復興我民族，建設我獨立自由與富强之新中國。換言之，即欲我全國同胞在意識上，行動上，生活上，一切俱澈底革新，以達成中國之現代化是也。回溯抗戰八年，歷盡艱難，終賴全民振奮，克致勝利，足見我民族精神與固有道德，實有其不可磨滅之光芒。今者勝利已將二年，建國工作外在之障碍早已消除，中華民國之憲法已經制定頒布，我國家即將邁進於民全政治與經濟建設之途。凡我同胞在私人生活上，更必須人人自勉，為不落伍之現代國民，担負國家安危與民族榮辱之重任。余於今年此日，乃不能不更致其殷切之期望。</p>
<p>投機取巧視為敗類</p>
<p>新生活之主旨在以禮義廉恥貫注於衣食住行之日常生活之中。新生活之信條曰整齊淸潔，曰簡單樸素，曰迅速確實。我同胞固已習聞久矣。分析言之，禮義示人以積極為善之敎條，廉恥示人以不可行之範圍，禮義勗人以毋怠毋荒，廉恥勵人以不投機，不取巧，不苟且，不徼倖；能實踐禮義廉恥，庶不愧為表裏健全之現代公民</p>
<p>至就新生活六項信條而言，整齊淸潔為强身淑羣之基本，其目的在使人人能潔身自愛。簡單僕素為立身治事之準則，其目的在節的。迅速確實為工作生產必備之條件，其目的在勤勉。明此數義，則新生活之厲行，固非僅獨善其身，實所以改革惡習，挽回頹俗，救國家於艱危，促社會之進步。是以凡我同胞，應知此世何世，此時何時，應知並世各國，均在突飛猛晋，以求進步，應痛念我國勝利以後，何以憂患頻仍，恥辱業積，內而不能求致和平與安定，外而不克保持國際友邦之尊敬。明乎此義，必須痛切反省，徹底覺悟，必須切戒空言，崇尙力行，必須屛絕虛偽，提倡篤實，必須視投機取巧為社會敗類之所為；奢侈浪費為國家蟊賊之行動。常此國事艱難，民生顛連之會，凡我愛國同胞，更必須人人負責任，守秩序，尊法制，重紀律，造成有組織，有秩序之國家，我民族為能積極進取之民族，此其一。</p>
<p>嚴格遵守經濟法令</p>
<p>風俗頹衰，於今為極，其在都市為患允著，勝利一年以上之歲月，仍不能滌敵偽毒化之殘留，奢侈淫靡，浪費無度，同胞之痛苦，視若無覩，國家之物力，罔知愛惜，長此無改，豈唯建國無望，直將遭致覆亡。凡我同胞，應知奢侈為亡國之原，節的為建國之本，務必努力求簡樸，崇尙節儉，試觀物力豐厚之友邦，猶有節衣縮食之規律，如我生產落後之家，豈宜恣意浪費，不知自愛，斷喪國本，國家經濟演變至今，已呈嚴重狀態，稍明大勢，必知此日艱難實無减於辛苦掙扎之戰時。對於國家管制經濟金融之法令，務當全力擁護，嚴格遵守。此時多節一分物力，即來日多增一分光榮，此其二。</p>
<p>勞資合作泯絕猜嫌</p>
<p>雙手萬能，國父之明訓，生產建設，富强之根本，我國當此戰後，農村凋敝，工業殘破，加之共產黨以非法武力，破壞交通，破壞工廠，生產日萎，民生日艱，衣食所需，仰給國外，入超之鉅，言之驚人，不求挽救，何以自立，是以工農同胞必須倍矢勤勞，努力工作，增進生產，充裕國力，尤須勞資合作，泯絕猜嫌，閉廠罷工，皆非所許。循此而行，則經濟危機，猶易克服，建國事功，乃能有成。此其三。</p>
<p>要而言之，國家今日實臨存亡興替之關頭，而轉危為安，端賴吾人此時之覺悟與努力，回思民國廿三年中正創導新生活之時，外而日寇侵凌，內而匪患滋蔓，一般國民幾已完全喪失自信。中正鑒此危機，亟圖挽救，荏苒十餘年，空前外侮卒已湔除，今日之患，惟在和平秩序之未能恢復，經濟生活之呈現動搖，然而事在人為，振衰起頹，亦惟在我全國國民一念之轉移。是用剴切忠吿，務希決志力行，父詔兄勉，成篤實勤儉之風，立建國自强之本，國家民族之前途，實利賴之。卅六年二月十八日，蔣中正。</p>
<p>紀念大會隆重舉行</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕新運總會為擴大紀念十三週年，定期分別舉行各項活動，十八日下午五時半紀念日前夕，蔣會長偕指導長蔣夫人蒞臨，當由黃仁霖報吿籌備經過，陪赴各陳列室參觀，對於各種出品精良者，頗多稱許，並指示改進意見，俾求完善，對會塲一切布置，表示滿意。又紀念大會十九日晨九時在該會禮堂隆重舉行，由沈怡任大會主席，會　將宣布蔣會長指示新運十四年度工作綱領。</p>
<h3>處置銀樓業辦法　財部即公布施行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕銀樓業及首飾店製成金飾之處理辦法，即將公佈施行。十八日京市銀樓仍未營業，該業曾集會商討有關今後營業之各項問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕京市銀樓十八日續停業。按全市共七十二家銀樓，從業人員千餘人，彼等曾集會商討；據同業公會負責人談，為體念國家困難，彼等當遵從明令，靜候新辦法之處置。惟亟盼早日公布，同時能解決千餘人失業問題。又財部頃己派員調查全市各銀樓存金及賬目，以明瞭是否有操縱投機情事。巿社局則派員前往慰問，囑靜候解決。</p>
<h3>在美華人存款　尙難移交我方</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十七日電〕華爾街方面人士，對蔣主席之緊急經擠措施，表示歡迎，並獸此為穩定中國經濟之「正確步驟」。彼等認為中國政府之新匯率，（即法幣一萬一千元合美金一圓），若能維持不動，可謂「合宜」。彼等對蔣主席之決定取消政府對私營工業之限制，亦表贊司。記者詢以美國銀行能否協助中國政府將在美之中國私人存款移交中國之銀行，經答覆稱，此種辦法違反嚴格限制銀行與顧客之交易之原則，故不可能實現。</p>
<h3>各地市塲風平浪靜</h3>
<p>榕銀樓業昨起停市</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕記者頃訪京市商會長王繹齋，請談經濟緊急方案公佈後京市商界之反應與影響。承吿，美釗黃金之禁止買賣，對於京市商塲並無多大影響，因京市商塲之經濟力量較弱，一向不對此作大量買賣；故一般商情，不致有所波動。對民生日用必需品配售之辦法，則表歡迎；因政麻如能掌握必需品物資，則各物自不至隨意上漲，而美鈔黃金即使公開買賣，亦即與日常用品脫節不生任何影響。王氏結論，認為京市商情將不致因新辦法而發生不良之波動。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十八日電〕蘇物價今齊趨下游，中等白米最高價為九萬八千元，惟全縣金銀業俱無市停業。縣物價審議委會十八日公佈第一次評價，反較市價略高。</p>

<p>經過了八年的長期抗戰以及勝利後的一年多以來，面臨中國的危難，顯有更加深刻化的跡象和趨勢。經過了一個漫長的黑夜，在迎了勝利的曙光以後，却又似陰霾四合，進入了另一個漫長的黑夜；好像眞有點像北極的寒冬，老是過着漫長的黑夜似的。人在這種情况之下，易致抑鬱因而絕望，原是無足怪的。然而就是北極的寒冬，也有悠長的夏月，充滿了北極的陽光。今日中國的局勢或不免令人抑鬱悲愁；但我們却不能因此而絕望。我們縱或進入另一個漫長的黑夜；但有黑夜，必有黎明。目前的危難，我們都有切身之感。我們要克服這些危難，來迎光明的來到。人類是在希望中生活綿延下去的；在當今這種艱難的時會，對於建設新中國的憧憬，我們尤應該抱有堅定的新希望。這新希望從那裏而又能產生？一個簡單的回答是：我們必須提高我們精神道德的力量。從這個源頭出發來整飭我們的生活，實行我們的新生活，我們纔會對周圍我們的一切產生一種新希望。這是在此意義下，當政府頒布了緊急經濟措施以後，我們來紀念新生活運動的十三周年，尤其感觸多端，意義深長。</p>
<p>現在中國一切病態的癥結是在於人心。經濟界的混亂，政治上的紛擾，以及行政效能的低落，這其間的一個主要因素，便是人心的不良。因為人心不良，所以儘管政府有什麽好的政策，推行的結果，往往與預期的目的距離很遠。所以政府一切的施政，如果不先從人心的改革做起，勢必徒勞。對於目前的經濟危難，我們旣著論以為政治的措施，其重要不亞於經濟的措施，且在某一意義下，政治更重於經濟。但政治上的措施，如果不先以改革人心為前提，則一切法良意美的政策，其施行的結果，或正與預期目的背道而馳。所以　國父說：「精社重於物質，革命必先革心。」我們從今日起，應該厲行革心；而革心必須從我起，我必須先革新我的生活行為，厲行新生活，然後纔能以我的新生活行為來表現我的「革心」。「心」與「行」是二而一的，必從一個人的行為革新，而終始能知其心的革新。</p>
<p>在新運十三周年紀念前夕，我　主席以日理萬幾之身，猶向全國廣播，曾提到革民的重要。「我國歷代政治家的施政，亦以易風易俗為先務，因國家之基礎在於社會，社會如不能樹立良好的風氣，國民如不能習於現代的生活，則國家決不能現代化。但自抗戰結束以來，敵偽餘毒未能滌除，國家秩序未能安定；以至風氣頹靡，精神消沈，人心陷弱，社會墮落。投機取巧者，自以為能；縱慾敗度者，恬不知恥。禮義謙恥，掃地無餘。」對於現社會的病態，我　席已剖述無餘。夷考國民生活之所以如此糜爛者，其主要因素，端在對於現實生活的失望，由失望而絕望，由絕望而糜爛。所以在目前，我們一面要絕處逢生，抱着一種堅定的新希望；一面却希望政府能整飭紀綱，使天下能够有是非之辨。政府的施政如果有是非之辨，然後紀綱纔不致於失墜，而人心也能維繋。「革心」是一種行為，其所以有此種行為，決定於外在的及內地的兩種因素。就內在的因素言，我們可以有主觀的革心，但若沒有外在的因素，則主觀的革心，除得天獨厚者外，似亦不易獲致。因此，為了要使每個人有革心的自動，我們必須注意到外在的因素。這就是我們必須有使人有革心的種種環境因素在，必須有種種外在的跡象，導使人民有革心的可能，然後纔能希望人民可以有『革心』。</p>
<p>可是心本來就是主觀的；而革心尤其是一種主觀的行為。當今之世，我們如果感覺到一切病徵倘使其病根全由於人心之壤，則必先自我來一下革新，或革心。我們不能靠外在的因素，必須從自發的內在因素，先求自我的革心，自我的革新。這自我革新的結果，便是有自我新生活的實踐。我們不能以人家不實行新生活而自我放棄新生活的實踐；倘若人人如此，新生活永無實踐的可能。我們必須先從自我做起，從我實行起。新生活之要義，在納禮主義廉恥於日常生活之中。禮義廉恥，是我國固有的道德。有人懐疑，新生活的提倡是復古。我們於此要提出的是人類生活必須有道德的標準，而道德標準卻沒有新舊之分。在一個新時代，我們仍舊要維持舊道德；因為道德是無所謂新舊的。道德的德行之解釋或有不同，但其價値則未嘗變異。中國前途之希望如何，就看新生活運動的是否成功。</p>
<p>為了中國的前途，新生活運動是只許成功，不許失敗的。如何使它能够成功，便在提高精神道德的力量。這表現在社會方面，同時也表現在個人方面。總之，新生活的實踐，必須先從自我做起。</p>

<h3>美蘇關係迄未開朗　馬歇爾擬直接會晤史達林　對蘇抗議覆文送達莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕消息靈通人士頃談稱：美國務卿馬歇爾業已要求史違林，在莫斯科四國外長會議期內單獨與其晤，俾經由私人接觸以改慮美蘇兩國關係。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕關於美國務副卿艾克遜最近發表聲明，指斥蘇聯政府採取「侵略與擴張領土主義」者之政策。蘇聯當局為此，曾照會美國提出抗議。頃據此間負責人士談內容，須俟至其送達莫洛托夫外長之後，始能加以公佈，此乃馬帥就任國務卿後所發出之第一次外交文件。按艾克遜前曾宣佈，國務院將就蘇聯所提抗議發表公報加以說明，但據悉馬帥寗願親自答覆蘇聯政府，而不欲在華盛頓發表公報，或飭令其下屬起草覆牒。美蘇關係在大體上仍屬暗昧不明，美參眾兩院明晟會議時將加以討論，屆時馬歇爾將向議員再度致辭。馬帥刻正準備其對於眾院外委會所當提出詢問之答覆，預料國會若干議員將提議對蘇採取一種「欲取之，必先與之」之政策，聞馬帥將向議員提供保證，即國務院對於美蘇關係以及蘇聯報紙攻擊美國，刻正加以特別考慮云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕關於蘇聯抗議美國務副卿艾克遜指斥蘇聯採取擴張領土政策一事，頃據接近艾克遜人士談稱，艾氏向國會發表對蘇政策聲明時，僅用「擴張勢力」一語，並未用「擴張領土」等語。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾欲物色一個共和黨人物作為顧問，俾伴同前往莫斯科參加會方我，此事甚感困難。共和黨巨頭范登堡已聲明不赴莫斯科，其他人物如杜爾斯等，均不足以代表共和黨國會代表團全體。馬卿亦不願任意揀選，惟恐有干涉政黨政治之嫌。</p>
<h3>修正同盟條約　英蘇開始談判　英法帝盟旨在防德侵略</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕消息靈通人士頃談稱：英駐蘇大使斐特遜業與蘇外長莫洛托夫，開始舉行會談，對於修正英蘇條約有所商討。按史達林曾函英外相貝文，主張修正英蘇同明條約。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十七日電〕可靠方面息：法政府之英法盟約草案，建議帝盟二十年，用意在防止德國之侵略。法方草約與法蘇盟約之用辭及含意頗為近似，規定訂約國雙方不得參加反抗對方之任何同盟制度。主在不同點乃為英法盟約，係將同盟關係列入聯合國機構範圍以內此外並規定兩國間之經濟合作。巴黎負責方面認為盟約之效能，尚須俟盟約訂立後之事態為準。如英法工業計劃及對德政策之合作，能於明約訂立後一一付諸施行，則盟約之效果必更重要。</p>
<h3>美國務院　整肅人事</h3>
<p>就有二百人辭職</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕國務院發言人稱，國務院處調查有「北景不明」嫌疑之人士以來，迄今有理由可以撤職者僅有二人。因各種理由自動離院者約二百人，若干人員在受訽以後，立即辭職。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十八日電〕美商務部今日發表一份長達五十七頁之報告，指責潛入政府機關中佔居要職之四百名區黨員，斥其僅向蘇聯效忠，利用政府之職位，而為外國謀利。報告中國催促國會應澈查區黨潛入國務院商務部等各機關。</p>
<h3>美加交換軍官</h3>
<p>〔路透社渥太華十八日電〕國防部長克萊斯登今日稱，美國與加拿大從事和平時代第一次軍事人員之交換，美陸軍官佐十二名，將來渥太華加軍總部，加拿大亦派陸軍官十四名前往華盛頓美軍總部。</p>
<h3>美總統任期　以兩屆為限</h3>
<p>參院法制委會通過</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕參院法制委會頃以九對一票通過限制美總統任期，不得超過八年，按此項限制案，早經眾院表決通過。法制委會並通過改正案一項，即總統在一期內任職不滿一年者，再可連任二期。以上兩項限制，均足以限制杜魯門總統，自一九四九年起，僅可連任一期。</p>
<h3>荷公主弄瓦</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙十八日電〕荷蘭王儔裘鹿安娜公主昨夜又生一女，此為公主與裴赫特親王之第四女。今後公主若不產生男孩，則荷蘭將三代由女一統治矣。</p>
<h3>美國之聲　開媽對蘇廣播　旨在促進兩國諒解</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕美國務院短波電台美國之聲，今日開始以俄語向蘇聯人民廣播。聞莫斯科方面收聽時，頗受歐洲電台之干擾與夾音。美國之首次廣播，有二千字關「國家權利」之討論，及世界新聞報告，插入唱片數張，據聯合社駐莫斯科訪員報告，美國謀以無綫電為工具，越過蘇聯之「鐵幕」，頗受蘇聯方面之注意。美國之播音，除受大氣阻撓外，尚被法國與蘇聯電台庶隔。該訪員述及三種蘇聯人士對於該項節目之印象如次：（一）太妄自尊大；（二）報告員太外行；（Dg）大致尚有趣味。廣播介紹詞中，曾引國務卿馬歇爾語稱，美國將「試以純粹事實，供給全世介人民」。</p>
<h3>美內長啓程赴日　與代管前日屬島事有關　美提出協定草案迫於內政原因</h3>
<p>〔聯合社加里福尼亞州長灘十八日電〕內政部長克魯格定今晨乘飛機前往日本，與麥帥會晤，收　情報，以供美國可能的管理太平洋前日屬島嶼之用。克氏西飛途中，將在檀香山稍作勾留，惟稱，歸途中將在夏威夷盤桓較久，俾獲取夏威夷羣島可能成為美國一州之資料。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖十七日電〕美國今日向聯合國機構提出太平洋前日屬島嶼之托管計劃，其中除規定防務細旨外，並有關於當地居民經濟社會及政治生活之規定，復建議將所有六百五十個島嶼上之行政，作為美國行政完整之一部。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十八日電〕據接近美代表團之人士稱：美國向聯合國提出關於前日本委治任各島之代管草案，乃內政上的原因使然。美國之草案已引起英蘇澳三國政府之正式抗議，而美國不顧一切，決定提出，亦引起多數代表團之非難。美方人士指出國務院對於此項草約贊助甚力，美軍界則主張立即將各該島合併。擁護草案者認為美國欲免帝國主義之責備，惟有出此一舉，以示服從聯合國憲章。美國以外之人士則認為安理會是否有權終止日本之委治而以代管權畀予美國，實成疑問。美國人士力言此種反對正予充分考慮，故美政府僅要求此一問題列入安理會議和，並不堅持立即加討論也。</p>
<h3>美應援助　民主國家</h3>
<p>眾議員裘特主張</p>
<p>〔聯合社西佛吉尼亞享汀登十八日電〕共和黨眾議員裘特，今日在此間馬紹爾大學致詞稱：美國「應向有關各方，剴切闡明吾人將為歐洲民主國家之臂助」，但「吾人並不援助各該國家在亞洲方面之帝國」。英法荷三國為戰後時代推行殖民主義主角，如果亞洲大部份被迫退返舊時殖民地形式，則「亞洲將告爆炸，而對於美國之影響，將與英法荷三國所受影響：「第二次世界大戰僅動武部份已告結束，震撼世界之觀念與政治戰爭，現正進行，以決定眞正博得此動武戰爭之勝利者，究屬何願。任何國家，其觀念終能控制歐洲之復興及亞洲龐大人力及潛在巿塲之發展者，方為第不論何國擊敗德日。此種爭鬥，在下述三要區尤其劇烈：（一）德國—其結果將決定歐洲命運……（二）中國—其動向將引導亞洲之動向……（三）美國—其動向將引導西半球之動向。決定吾人對國內外將來方針之觀念爭鬥，其結果對於決定德國與中國所將遵循之途徑，確有極大影響，或許竟有決定性影響」。等裘特曾在中國任醫務敎士，屢次演說，均主張美國對中國國民政府，予以無條件的承認，援助及讓步。</p>

<h3>東非發現白金</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕東非英委治地坦于尼格之查倍山脈中，發現白金礦藏，已將樣品送倫敦鑑定，政府同時下令禁任可人等至該處採取礦源。</p>
<h3>日本即可恢復　對外私人貿易　麥帥總部貿易管理處宣布</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十七日電〕麥帥總部對外貿易管理處副處長畢克爾今日宣稱：外國與日本商人間短期內即可恢復有限制的私人貿易，日期尚不能規定，大約今夏可以實行。總部將准許少數商人來日購置若干指定貨物。全部私人貿易，當由日政府發給出口許可證，並由麥帥總部核准此種制度，可准許政府與私人貿易同時並行。遠東委員會中大部份國家現均有聯絡團駐日，與總部討論對日貿易問題。此種私人貿易可不用日圓計値。總部方面可規定價格，商人可以信用證書向總部付値。</p>
<p>英商亦將與日　恢復舊時關係</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕外務部發言人今日宣稱：英國要求恢復對日貿易，已獲美國務院滿意答覆。英商即可派遣代表至日，恢復舊日關係，發展進出口貿易，此與英國有益，亦可加速日本經濟復興。惟截至目前為止，麥帥總部迄未有所表示，總部方面歷來因糧食與住屋缺乏之故，曾禁止全部盟國商人入境。即美國商業，自勝利以來，亦由官辦之貿易公司經營，該公司代表政府統制日本進出口貿易，日本進口貨幾全部由美國供給，美國並購置日本出口貨約百分之六十五，出口貨其餘部份則輸往朝鮮中國與蘇聯。</p>

<h3>美賠償委員擬就　日本賠償新計劃　目的在使日自給自足　與鮑萊計劃本質上大不相同</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十八日電〕美國賠償委員馬克羅公司經理斯特來克，馬克列爾，巴傑斯，齊塞達因上校，及克勞斯少校五人，一月廿八日來日視察日本工廠及生產設備後，今日由斯特來克代表五人對記者談稱：五人均以技術家之立塲來日研究日本之賠償問題。此次視察範圍，包括工業設備，民間財產，已被指定充賠償用之工廠（包括仍在開工者及停工者），及未被指定之工廠。調查結果，已報告麥帥總部，回國後將向陸軍部提出報告，報告書內容刻無詳細發表之必要，然該報告可謂根據現狀所作最佳報告。斯氏繼答記者問如下：</p>
<p>（問）日人認為鮑萊專員之計劃，將與日本以毀滅的影響，賠償委員以為如何？（答）吾人之調查基礎，係使日本保留足以自給自足程度之產業。</p>
<p>（問）聯以前所作賠償計劃，重新加以檢討，賠償委員將如何指定賠償用工廠？（答）吾人與指定工廠無關。吾人之使命，係向規定日本產業水準之美陸軍部提出報告，並非從新指定工廠。吾人之計劃，其要點在使由四大島而成之日本，能自給自足，能為輸入而輸出。</p>
<p>（問）指定賠償用之工廠，其損壞情形如何？（答）隨工廠而異。</p>
<p>（問）日本之產業水準置於何處？（答）吾人不追溯至一八九四年（甲午戰爭）或一九一四年（第一次歐戰）。一方面一九三〇年固當加以考慮，一九五〇年之情形亦予以考慮。</p>
<p>（問）賠償委員此次所作報告，是否與鮑萊專員這計劃本質上不同？（答）係本質上不同。惟事人之計劃是否較鮑萊計劃寬大當任由各人判斷。</p>
<p>（問）如決定一九五〇年之日本自給自足經濟，則日人之生活水準，將置於何處？（答）當須根據歷史及資料。一九三〇年代中葉，日人之生活程度如何，亦當加以考慮。</p>
<p>（問）拆去賠償設備，須要多少期間？（答）不知。</p>
<p>（問）是否陸軍部認為賠償設備有從新調查之必要？（答）不知。然美陸軍部於去年十二月廿五日招集技術家。提出一種建議，則為事實。</p>
<p>（問）美陸軍部之見解，可否解釋為業已轉變方向？（答）係感覺必須由技術方面觀察。</p>
<p>（問）進行調查日本賠償設備，曾否加以考慮？（答）賠償設備如何分配，應由遠東委員會決定。</p>
<p>（問）有人以為拆去賠償設備，重新加以裝置開工，需要相當時間，故與其拆去，不如置於日本，而取其生產品，較為得策，賠償委員以為如何？（答）此點曾加以研究，但不宜寫入報告中。</p>
<p>（問）紡織設備，是否拆去？（答）日本之紡織生產能力，無减少之必要。</p>
<p>（問）視察日本各地後，認為賠償設備無大用處否？（答）由此可知記者團甚為聰明。</p>

<h3>檢查行莊財部負責　五十億透支可恢復　沒收保管庫中黃金說並其事　財次昨招待金融界釋疑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午四時，財次徐柏園及錢幣司長戴銘禮，假　聯總處會議室招待本市銀錢兩萊代表。主席徐柏園首先致辭，表明財部澈查行莊業務，用意在保全正當銀錢業之信譽，與今後政令之澈底推行。在次序上，當首先料正國家行局及省市公營銀行之業務。檢查工作力避妨碍各行莊日常業務之進行，希望能得各行莊主管之協助。</p>
<h3>兩業代表　坦白陳述意見</h3>
<p>辭畢，徐氏請出席者儘量發表意見，當時銀錢界發言者，計有秦潤卿，李軔哉，徐國懋，王延松，程俊觀等，均就銀錢業身受之痛苦及對財部之希望，作坦白之陳述。歸納各項意見，不外下列各點：（一）請政府查明金潮之責任，投機者究屬商人居多數，抑非商人居多數。如銀錢業中有投機者，屬於何帮何家，均請政府查明公佈。（二）過去聯合準備會與中央銀行訂有契的，得透支五十億元，此次金潮發生後，中樞已下令停止透支。按此項透支辦法，早經財部批准，而此筆款子，爲備而不用之性質，保證不致用足。五十億數目不大，對於政府之政策並無影響，但對於各行莊，則爲一重保證，希望政府准子恢復透支。（三）希望此次之檢查爲積極性質，除與金潮有關者外，勿過於瑣碎苛擾，吾則可能將游資逐出金融界，爲害尤烈。目前我國之生產，已進入麻脾狀態，希望當局對全國生產界之需要，有一正確之估計，以便作適當之協助。今日之要圖爲把握物資，促進生產，似宜召集上海產業界開會，以便確定數額，對症下藥。目前央行以低價收購黃金之舉，不甚妥善，最好能爲黃金開闢一正當之出路，即准許在優越條件之下，以黃金易成外匯，購買必需之生產工具。（四）目前銀行之存款太少，與游資之數額不成比例，故金融界無力量控制市場之利率，希望政府能减低存款利息所得稅，以利銀行之吸收存款，同時希望本票無需存款進備。（五）希望能提高掛牌利率。因目前物價上漲，行莊開支浩大，非提高利率，無以開支，事實上市塲利率早已超過掛牌。（六）檢查行莊賬簿，過去規定，只有法院及財政部可查，在目前緊急措施之下，其他機關是否可查？誚明白答覆。（七）外傳檢查保管庫發現黃金，即可沒收，請財次當塲闢謠。（八）管制金融新辦法中，對於放款用途一節，希望能有一明白之規定，俾各行莊有所遵循。（九）央行目前與商業銀行之間，形成脫節之現象，央行僅爲「政府之銀行，而非爲銀行之銀行」，對於調劑金融，未能盡買，銀根鬆金價漲時不拋售黃金及物資，反之今日銀根緊時，反大拋棉紗，實所不解。（十）希望今後能以地產作爲供貸抵押品，爲　資開闢一條出路。</p>
<p>冀與政府·建立互信</p>
<p>以上各項意見，由徐　兩氏分別答覆。戴銘禮當塲表示財部已與有關方面治妥，今後行莊之檢查仍由財部負責。徐柏園表示五十億之透支，如無特殊情形，仍可依契的辦理，保管庫之檢查，照政府規定之條例辦理，並無發現黃金即加沒收之事。銀行對生產事業放款，自須有詳細記載，此爲一般銀行所必具者。至於目前之檢查，自屬於積極性質，惟因此次風潮由金融而起，故檢查亦偏重行莊，今後當有在經濟上之積極措施。財部對於正當之商業銀行始終協助，決無為難之意。協助生產爲今後金融上之要務，可遺憾者爲去年之生產貸款，確有一部分被用以購買黃金者，將來查明後當嚴辦，而經辦之行局，亦應負道義上之責任。希望今後上海之金融界，能與政府建立互信，而在行動上互相配合。</p>
<h3>戰前存款　增値給付</h3>
<p>財部尚在研究中</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據財决徐柏園表示：戰前存款增値給付之倍數，財部尚在硏究之中，最近可有解決。將來倍數之確定，當謀存款人及銀行之利益均能顧到，而求其公平合理。</p>
<h3>三人小組會　查行莊賬冊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財次徐柏園前晚在宣司令私邸召集經濟監察團團員及各組負責人會商合作辦法，並報告此次奉派來滬任務，係澈查金潮詳情，將特別注意各行莊非法收受黃金抵押及拋空套購等行爲。查有實據者依法嚴懲。爲求達成任務，希望與警備部合作，共同進行。常即決定成立三人小組委員會，由財部錢幣司長戴銘禮，四聯總處高處長，及經濟監察團金鈔組長徐幼祚三人組成，指揮金鈔組原有工作人員及財部指派來滬之職員分成七單位，繼續檢查全市行莊賬册。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕經濟監察團昨繼續調查監視工作，市塲狀况益見良好。糧食組並派武裝人員分赴郊區漕河涇周家橋楊樹浦一帶取締黑市買賣。紗布市價昨亦繼續大跌，金鈔組調查行莊賬册已獲端倪，日內或即將採取行動。</p>
<h3>兪財長來滬視察　王雲五蕭錚返京</h3>
<p>財長兪鴻鈞爲視察滬上金融動態，昨晨來滬聽取報告，並有重要決定。其要點爲：（一）指示各行局增强業務。（二）駐滬各省市銀行業務範圍應在財部核准以內，如有超越者，應即日停業。兪氏並於昨午十時許謁宋院長，有所陳商。當夜返京。又經濟部長王雲五偕决長蕭錚，已於昨夜搭車返京。</p>
<h3>買賣美鈔續獲四人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備部第四稽查大隊昨在四川路九江路口拘獲收　美鈔犯陳宗竊一名。又警察局在北四川路一帶捕獲置賣黃金及美鈔犯孫正富，楊啓潮，單雄華等三名。</p>
<h3>物品供應細則　內分三大部門　尙須呈由主席核定後施行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日是用物品供應辦法實施細則，自經國府主計處主計長徐堪，於十七日召集各關係機關負責人擬妥後，榮由徐氏會同經·財·糧部等負責人，於十八日晨携呈宋院長核定。宋院長當表示：尚待呈請蔣主席核定後，然後再行公布施行。聞該項施行細則內容，大致分三大部門。一係公敎人員實物之配售，二係產業工人實物之配售，三係　定物價之細則。實施時，將光先由各請配售之機關，編造名册。交行政院核定後，然後核發購買證。同時將由行政院物資供應局核發物資供應券。各供應物資之機關，則將物資集中各地市政府。各公敎人員可憑購買證及供應劵，向市府購買。配售物品數量，大致將以每公敎人員，有家屬四口爲準，職員之配售量，將較工人者略多。</p>
<h3>吳開先談話　公怖緊急措施　無異經濟戒嚴　實施配給制穩定物價　盼大家忍耐渡此難關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨已銷假視事，昨接見記者談：此次政府所公佈之經濟緊急措施方案，等於宣佈經濟上之戒嚴。相信因金潮引起之風波，於短期內，必可因此逐漸趨於穩定。待風潮過去，戒嚴撤銷，此項緊急措施，即可停止。以往工人與商人兩方面？互相推諉責任，工人稱因物價高而工資增高，商人則稱由於工資增高，影饗成本，物價遂被帶高，此與爭論鷄與蛋何者先有一樣，其實互爲因果。此次政府先將工資安定，下令不得超過一月份之生活指數，一面於短期內盡力做到將物價拉下，以全力處理議價問題，使責任有所分明。假如商品再高，則顯見為商人之責任。此國家經濟危險時之紫急揹罈，還望大家能加忍耐，相信此一時間不致過長，短期內必能穩定。</p>
<p>供應日用品三月起實施</p>
<p>關於本人提出之配給方案，除文化工作人負及私立學校敎職員等，經删去外，餘均經中央照案採納。此項辦法先就京滬兩地實施，其他各地再陸續推行。本市公敎人員部份，由市政府成立委員會辦理，工人之生活必需品供應，則由社會局協助有關機關處理之。該項日用必需品供應，本月因採辦不及，故將自三月起實施。在未實施前，本月份工資之計算，已與宋院長商定，將二月份與一月份之市價差額，折合法幣發給之。叧因固定辦法或嫌呆板，各地風土人情習慣或有不同，故亦徵求宋院長同意，可因地制宜，因人制宜，酌量情形，通融處置。</p>
<p>吳局長並稱：在此辦法實施後，如工廠仍有虧蝕情形，政府旣不准停閉，則當審核需要，應予救濟。</p>
<p>人民購金飾非助長投機</p>
<p>對於取締黃金買賣辦法中，包括飾金在內，吳氏認爲不當。渠認爲人民將每月些微之盈餘，換購金飾，爲一種良好之變相儲蓄，無形中帮助政府推行收縮通貨政策。否則用以購貨，必將剌激物價。一部份人認爲去年工人之年終獎金，多用以添購金飾，亦爲助長投機之一因，此爲盲目言論，蓋助長投機者非購金戒金環之小市民，而爲收購金條之人。故飾金應加開放，否則黃金之出路，若非走私即成廢物，故已與經濟部長談及，從速制定補救辦法。</p>

<h3>各業對政府決策　一致表示願協助　商高會昨召開物價會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會於昨日下午三時召開物價會議，計經濟部决長蕭錚·吳市長·潘議長·及各業公會理事長常務理事等的四百人。由主席徐寄廎報告開會宗旨後，即請蕭次長致詞，略謂：此次國防最高委員會通過經濟緊急措施方案，其用意在挽救目前經濟危機，政府此次通過此方案，即在消滅投機市塲，輔助正當工商業，推動國外貿易，以謀整個經濟情形之　定。然一方面提高匯率，發展國際貿易，一方面亦須顧到國內物價之高漲與民生之困難，故不得不採取有効方法，以謀抑平物價，將物價納人正常之供求關係中，而不以外幣高下爲轉移。此則除政府力量外，百分之八十須仰仗於在座諸君。政府對於工商業之困難，甚爲明瞭，故對於工資之穩定，亦極力設法，因工資與物價之循廻角逐，將使正當工業瀕於破產，故決定將工資固定，而採實物配給制。深望工商各業與政府同心協力，達到此項目的。</p>
<p>希望各業勿圖小利</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致詞略謂：本人有四點意見：（一）金鈔禁止買賣後，容或發生黑市，此點固由政府負責徴處，同時更希望工商各界勿跟隨金鈔黑市，抬高物價。（二）政府爲使遊資有正當出路計，決定將敵偽物資，剩餘物資與國營生產事業，實行標賣或發行股票，惟深望不致因此引起囤積居奇，望各業公會不但禁止本業囤積，更應檢舉非本業之囤積。（三）日前金鈔高漲，各種物價皆跟隨上漲，現金鈔價格已有規定，各種物價亦應自動减低。（四）上海物價波動，每每影響全國，望各業勿貪圖一時小利，而使全國經濟情形陷於紊亂。</p>
<p>金飾凍結極不適當</p>
<p>繼由潘議長致詞：大意凡五點：（一）希望各種出口貨品，如絲·茶·桐油·猪鬃等，勿因匯率改訂，而一漲再漲。此種不合理之漲價，等於自殺。（二）此次政府通過經濟緊急措施辦法，外界有挖苦爲「非常時期之重溫」者，須知目前之中國，確仍處於非常時期中，政府之緊急措施辦法，實係自救而亦救濟人民。（三）緊急措施辦法能否生效，須視人事健全與否而定，人事不健全，則最好之辦法，可能變爲最危險之辦法。（四）對於禁止金飾買賣，致銀樓停業，本人以爲絕對不適當。因此項辦法，將使民問之金飾凍結，使勁儉居積之平民，喪失一部分資財，此無異政府將貨品售與人民，然後宣偉無效。（五）對於前日當局逮補私賣美鈔之人犯，是否查明其係公開買賣，如僅因其携帶美鈔而逮捕，則隨時隨地皆有被捉之可能。</p>
<p>各業代表希望數點</p>
<p>潘氏調畢，即由吳市長就禁止飾金買賣與逮捕私賣美鈔人犯事有所解釋，此後即由各公會代表發表意見，一致表示對於政府施策，極願協助，惟希望政府多多採納各業之意見，對於穩定工資，實物配給，平價原料配給等，希望政府能有切實有效之辦法、對於取締高利貸，舉辦生產貸款等，尤望能秉公處理。繼續討論至六時，始宣告散會。</p>

<h3>西南最高學府　四川大學巡禮</h3>
<p>本報駐蓉記者周學端</p>
<p>出成都東郊，沿「濯錦溥　江萬里流」的錦江西上，三里許，便到有名的薛　故蹟望江樓。江樓南畔，一片平曠，至紅花綠　中點綴幾幢巍峨雄壯的宮殿式建築物，這裏便是中國西南最高學府的國立四川大學。</p>
<p>四川大學—一般人簡稱用大—所以爲西南最高學川大是當代規模最完備的學校，不特大學部包括文，法，農，理工，師範五學院二十三系，而且有研究所〔文，理，經濟〕，附屬中學與小學，夜校與先修班，所謂「五世同堂」，應有盡有。第二、川大從前身仕學館兩合併到現在，有五十年悠久歷史，其發展過程即是一部四川現代敎育華北史，而五十年的川大畢業生，廣佈全川，實爲推進數十年四川致治，社會，文化，各項建設的原動力，是以用大與四川，息息相關。有此兩種特性，川大便可以代表四川敎育，記者因此特就川大概况，作一輪廓介紹。</p>
<p>川大沿革</p>
<p>川大係前公立四川大學，成都大學，成都師範大學合併而成。歷史以公立川大爲最早，遜淸學制維新，即有「什學館」與「存古學堂」，光緒卅一年合併爲四川法政學堂，民國改爲法政大學，民十六年合併法政，外文，國學，三專校爲公立川大。成都大學與師範大學，淸時爲四川優級師範學堂，民元改爲四川高等師範學校，民三改爲國立高等師範學校，十五年分別改組爲成都大學與師範大學。十七年前大學院訓令川敎廳，合併川省各大學及專校爲國立四川大學，二十年三大學合併成功，遂產生今日之川大。在合併後十五年，歷任校長有王兆榮，任鴻雋，程天放，現任校長爲黃季陸。</p>
<p>目前概況</p>
<p>川大爲目前全國院系最多規模最備之大學，學生總數共五千餘人，組織分研究所，大學，夜校與先修班，附屬中學，小學五系統，內容如次：</p>
<p>（一）研究所：有文科研究所，內分語言文學，文字，史學，經學四組，所長向楚。理科研究所，現有化學部，分有機，無機，理論，應化，藥學五組，所長湯秀夫。經濟研究所，爲西甫社會科學硏究處之一部，所長彭迪先，專門硏究西南經濟資源與運輸物價等經濟狀况。</p>
<p>（二）大學部：現有五學院二十三系，法學院包括政治，經濟，法律三系，院長吳永權。文學院包括中文，外交，史地三系，院長向仙喬。農學院包括農藝，農經，森林，農化，　桑，園藝，病蟲害七系及附屬農塲，院長彭家元。理工學院包括數學，物理，化學，生物，土木工程，電機工程，航空工程七系，及化騐專修科與實習工廠，院長鄭瞻韓。師範學院包括敎育系與管調部，院長鄧只淳。</p>
<p>（三）夜校與先修班：夜校是川大特設，用意在救濟失學之公務員與職業靑年，修學五年，畢業後仍可得學士學位。現有國文，法律，商學三組，另有新聞專修科，先修班，目的在救濟未能升學之中學畢業生，現共有受大學補習敎育學生二千餘人。</p>
<p>（四）附屬中學與小學：川大之附中與附小，創辦已有三十餘年歷史，爲成都素負聲譽之學校，現行政系統直屬師範學院，亦爲該院畢業學生實習與服務之實騐學校。</p>
<p>前途展望</p>
<p>川大雖是具有悠久歷史的西南最高學府，但數十年來，由於國家迄未安定，川局始終動盪，使川大一直在　路藍縷中慘淡經營，在艱難困苦中奠定規模。從遜清仕學館到民廿三大合併，這段過程是川局混濁時期，也是四川新敎育啓蒙時代，川大方在此期中醞釀發芽。從新川大成立到現在的十五年，川局逐漸開朗，敎育遂臻繁榮，而川大也茁壯成長。川大發育與四川政局及敎育進程具有如是密切關係，所以在記者訪問川大從校長敎授而學生，人人均以建設新四川為川大的責任與義務，這是川大目前的敎育中心思想，也是川大今後發展的敎育方針。</p>
<p>黃季陸校長，是國內老敎育家，他認為：「川大過云辛勤」奮鬥的工作是艱苦的，今天已經走過披荆斬棘的一段艱苦途程，努力給川大帶來了更優越的條件，」而今後國家的建設經緯萬端，建設人才的需要也最爲迫切，川大享有優越的發展條件，自當儘先儘可能的擔負此一任務。川大是川省最高學府，四川是全國建設實騐區，培植建設新四川的高級建設人才，這是黃氏對川大今後發展的遠大計劃。發展方針，決定在求質量平均發展，並擴大增加院糸，預期在最短期中，使川大成爲全國大學中，院糸最多，質量並佳的學校。</p>
<p>用大戰前校址在成都皇城蜀漢劉先主的故蹟，戰時一度遷移全國四大名山的峨眉山，現在校址瀕錦江之　。最近建築落成者，有圖書，數理，化學三館，及文彬樓，醮樑盡棟，建築富麗，錦江環繞，牆帆往來，沙鷗明滅，莘莘學子在巍峨維偉的建築物中弦歌吟誦，回念到從前皇城的破敗殘朽，峨眉山的　壞簡陋，這正象徴川大由辛勤困苦中建設產生的未來，前途是光明的。</p>

<h3>鐵路小球賽　材料勝營業</h3>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>昨晚籃球聯賽，一如本報預料：春茂在始終下風的局勢下，以接近的比數，敗於仁餘。　兩隊演出，恰在平日水準，是戰不啻變方實力的衡量，春茂投籃技巧略遜一籌，所負三球，是應得之果。</p>
<p>仁餘以王槐庭，孫國政，沈鵬舉演出較可意，姚文彝大爲失常。春茂因福善被牢守，僅賴家彪，福强得分點綴，何涵夫幾次遠射　失，賢政也屬功不抵過。</p>
<p>福善以乏隙進攻，改任助守，惟仁餘多探籃人才，雖迫至角邊，仍從容投人。春茂昨夕防守並不堅固，旣失於大意，又似缺乏自信心。</p>
<p>下牟時終塲前，孫國政犯滿罰出，春茂僅以一球落後，正思反敗爲降，不意梁永佳力射中的，春茂士氣遂挫。</p>
<p>春茂除開首以五—〇領前外，以後即一直形成追隨，相去恒在五六分之間。</p>
<p>黃天烈臥病，春茂替補乏人，亦一大打擊。（昌年）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕宋院長以輪出推廣委員會執委會成立後，迄未與該會執委及所聘顧問等正式會談。昨日上午十一時起，迄中午十二時卅分止，特在中國銀行大樓召集該會有關人士談話。到主委員祖詒，執委林鳳苞，劉攻芸，沈配瑞，顧問束雲章，王仰先，陳長桐，郭子勛，馬保之，胡筠秋，徐謝康，歐陽崙，徐廣遲，麥克，羅傑士，李特爾，凱世威，及張似旅等。宋院長當闡述政府推廣輸出之決策，深望各執委及顧問等，努力協助，研究增加生產，及解除出口困難之方法。旋由各出席人士，分別發表意見，茲擇其犖大者，摘記如次：（一）運輸不便，是為出口貿易最大之窒礙亟待解決。例如：目前自漢口裝貨來滬之運費，較自滬裝貨赴美之運費，尙昂貴百分之廿。（二）政府調整外匯率，當有助於出口貿易。惟出口物資之價格，務求維持穩定。否則調整匯率所得之利益，終將為騰漲價格之成數所沖淡。結果，調整外匯率依然不能發生效果。例如近日桐油猪鬃等價格，已漲起百分之五十。（三）政府雖曾經由四聯總處，發放大批生產貸款。惟實際受惠者，均係都市有規模之製造商。內地出口物資之小生產商，甚或不明四聯總處機構之性質。且出口物資運滬時間，常須在一月以上。故亟望應予此批小生產商，以資金上之融通。（四）增加紗布生產，確信具有把握，惟電力供應問題，有待解決，（五）華南走私，盼迅速制止，並希積極使粵漢鐵路全面通車，（六）英國需用我國蛋類甚殷，出口貿易應立即推動。宋院長於聆聽各人士意見後，當摘錄備案，允予充份考慮，分頭解決。</p>
<p>央行收兌美鈔　昨日益形擁擠</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨日按新牌價，賡續收兌黃金美鈔。各界前往求兌者，已較日前為踴躍。惟其中仍以持美鈔求兌者為多。二樓業務局外匯科椻台前，求兌者排列成隊。昨日在兌換美鈔前，尙須塡具該行，特備之油印兌換申請書。十元以下及廿元以上之鈔劵，須分紙塡寫。聞今起將取消該項申請兌換辦法，央行將直接憑鈔兌換。據該行業務局某負責人談稱：該行對各種票面美鈔，均一律收兌，並未拒絕收兌五十元以上票而之美鈔。昨日兌換數量，雖未明確統計，惟估計常較日前廿五萬元之數，已見增加。至黃金之收兌量，則不至如美鈔之多。良以各界認為央行牌價太低，故求兌者殊不多見。即有之，亦多屬各行莊為調劑頭寸而兌出者，確數則無從估計云。</p>
<h3>公債起落有限</h3>
<p>公債昨尙穩定，五四〇室有買，六〇四室先進後出，四四五室五五二室則賣，統丙起仆有限，晨開六二〇〇元，高至七三〇〇元，而後回落五七〇〇元，午刻　　，結果較前收各債除丁種外，均稍見升，成交的七百萬元。</p>
<h3>外股過程平庸</h3>
<p>外股昨盤旋回漲，午後怡紗見一五〇〇〇元高價，而後盤，小股由高微降，過程十分平庸，結果較前收計怡紗航業各升半成强，英聯合德豐鋼業各升半成左右，餘均微降。</p>
<h3>錢兌商暫停業　今召開緊急會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕錢兌業公會理事長汪雲程昨語記者：本業在未奉政府新辦法前，全體同業，決暫停營業。惟同業衆多，難免良莠不齊，現決於明日下午三時，召開緊急會議，將督飭各同業，恪遵法令，勿做不法買賣，免損同業信譽。又該業若干常務理事，且提議組織糾察團，以便監督同業行動，聞亦將於明日會議中提出討論云。</p>
<h3>糖價再度軟化</h3>
<p>昨糖市以實銷未旺，再度軟化。公會劃盤；如現貨中砂白等續小萬元，土糖亦再降三五千元。順德靑開十二萬二千元至十一萬八千元，次之十一萬五千元。刁靑開十二萬五千元，統共成交二三百包，其勢須俟去胃轉旺，方有回振之望。</p>
<p>又訊：台灣糖業公司上海辦事處第七次配售食糖，業定本週四（二十日）開始配發，為抑平糖價起見，聞對中砂·赤砂兩種食糖，本期仍暫停配售。最近粗砂市價已跌至十九萬三千元，與配價相較，僅為三千元，視形勢且尙有下挫之可能。又上决該公司配出貪糖共計二萬九千九百二十三包，本次因糖價下瀉，糖業申購數量已不及六次之多矣。</p>
<h3>市塲利率</h3>
<p>方案推行盡利　不久可望回低</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財次徐柏園昨對記者談稱：國府此次頒行經濟緊急措施方案，如各方條件配合齊全，推行盡利，則渠保證，本市市塲利率，在一個月內，將降低至一角以內云。</p>
<h3>茶市依然寥寂</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，交易依然稀少。晨開後各方買氣表面似頗活躍，惟供售者仍復寥寥。且仰天討價，漫無標準。聞　五年度頂祁門，每担在呌一百五十萬元，卅四年份陳特祁門，亦高呌百萬關邊。他若新陳袖珍及珍眉等綠茶，每担均需四五十萬元至一百二三十萬元不等。是以吐納雙方談判之結果，終未圓滿，市勢岑靜。依現狀觀察，執貨者如堅不讓步，寂寞局面恐將持續。</p>
<h3>臨收忽傳利買消息　華股漲勢又蓬勃　美亞新亞中法相繼漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨在銀根見緊之下，浮多咸形惴惴不安，加以掉期迫近，漲後立回，僅美亞因哄買有人，尙形挺進，惟臨收十餘分鐘內，忽在利買傳說中暴漲，均以高價結束。</p>
<p>晨開　即承前收餘風而見昇，九五號一七八號二三二號力購，開後即將遞永紗拉高至一八七〇元，二二四號一〇五號五七號七六號脫手，降至一七八〇元，一九八號二二四號二〇七號一八五號趁低維持，回漲到一八五〇元，一四號二〇四號二二號一四五號尙賣，退至一七五〇元，一七九號一七二號二一五號尙來維持，升為一七八〇元，二二四號一九六號一四五號九九號一七八號三六號再有脫手，降為一七三〇元，一七七號二一八號三五號四號尙納，又升至一七六〇元。十時半後，趨入徘徊之途，後經六一號及散多了結，又迫低至一七三〇元，一〇六號二一八號九四號一九七號一四號爭買，美亞漲風重起，十一時後回升至一七八〇元，一九八號四七號三〇號一四一號五七號乘機斬售，遞永紗仍難支撑，十一時半後，一四一號一五二號九一號一五六號書售，遞永紗遂破人一七〇〇元大關內，七六號尙來補空，午收站一七一〇元左右，結果較前收計永紗信和微降，景福新光勤興各跌半成强，華豐微升，美亞再漲半成，遞交計永紗信和景福各降半成弱，新光跌一成弱，華豐微升，美亞再漲半成，冷股商務國貨穩定外，餘均微降反跌半成强不等。</p>
<p>午後　三五號二一八號二二號二三二號俱進，遞永紗升至一七五〇元，九七號一五六號九一號尙有脫手，退至一七二五元，美亞在一八五號一五二號進胃奇殷之下，漲勢奇熾，二二四號二三二號一九八號一八〇號三五號一〇二號一五二號奮購，逐漸升至一七六五元，九一號一五六號九五號脫手，退至一七四〇元，三時後，聞出口匯票有大批結售予央行，銀根大鬆，且當局有利於股市之宣言等說，買氣突熾，一五二號一九八號一九七號七六號二二四號一四五號等一再爭購，美亞在二二六號七八號等買意奇健下，兩者突形暴漲，臨收竟以高峯結束。結果較前收計永紗信和景福勤興華豐各升一成光景，新光升牛成弱，美亞漲停，遞交永紗信和景福升半成强，新光升半成弱，華豐漲一成弱，美亞漲停，冷股新亞漲停，中法漲停後竟貼價十元有餘，統益中紡中絲微降，景綸內衣火柴平平，餘微升，場外各股均見回漲。</p>
<h3>銀樓代表請願　提出四項建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業同業公會，因黃金停止買賣後，營業陷於停頓狀態，除前日向社會局請願救濟外，下午並曾召開理監事聯席會議，討論今後營業辦法。並推派裘天寳，楊慶和，寳成各銀樓負責人姚蕙芳，姚桂卿，吳彭年等代表，於昨日兩度往市府向吳市長請願，提出要求四項：（一）銀樓製售飾品每件重量不得超渦關平二兩，並不得熔化小條出售。（二）准許銀樓等收兌飾金，其價格應遵照中央銀行所規定。（三）收兌金飾除供製飾品外，有餘應售與中央銀行，不足則向中央跟行申請配給，（四）營業利潤由銀樓商業同業公會參酌情形及生活指數並徵求中央銀行同意決定之。對於該項要求，市長已允考慮，惟整個辦法，須待中央對於銀樓飾金辦法公佈後一始，可作最後決定。</p>
<h3>聯營資金未繳存中交　協導會不能發放原料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕絲織輸出協導委會，於昨晨九時許，召開會議，由主委林鳳苞親臨主持。討論經過，各列席人士，認為絲織聯營公司近以與協導會成立合的後，迄未遵照合的規定，將籌集之資金五億元，全部分存認可之中交兩銀行，致協導會亦迄未能發給原料及工繳等，以備開工。現聯營公司雖以工人將發動罷工，及機台呆擱導原因，呈請發給原料，該會仍決定須待全部資金繳存中交兩行後，始能考慮發放云。</p>
<h3>粉廠請求貸款　支持配粉政策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四聯總處與市銀行已決定貸款二十億元。與茂新·福新·阜豐·華豐·裕通等五大粉廠，作為採購小麥之資金，據福新粉廠某負責人稱，此次各粉廠請求貸款，並非為救濟本身之用，乃在運用此項貸款以支持政府之配粉政策，因近來小麥價格飛漲，每擔已高至七萬六千元，如以原料人工合計，則每包麵粉之成本應在五萬元以上，各粉廠為維持配售計，除由政府貼補外，本身亦不斷貼補，致各粉廠過去積存之小麥，多巳貼補凈盡，此次請求貸款之宗旨，即欲在此困難環境中，使麵粉配售不致中絕，惟各粉廠過去之盈餘，旣已貼盡，此後實無力補貼，未識政府此後將採取補貼政策，抑或採取成太政策，故此項貸款撥下後，如何運用，尙須視政府之政策而定</p>
<p>又訊，本市麵粉供應，現仍由山信周每日配售利浪洋粉一萬二十包，其議價仍未改變，惟自本月二十三日起，將改為配售國產麵粉，由福新，阜製，茂新。華鹽，裕通等五大麵粉廠輾磨，並由吳市長協助向四聯總處貸款二十億元，該項貨款業已向四聯總處承貸，各該麵粉廠已向各產麥區採購小麥，首批一一萬担業已運到，連日已在加緊輾磨中，以便屆時提出配售，五粉廠代表席德柄榮毅仁錢壽椿等昨午特赴市府謁吳市長，請示二十三日起配售手續，故嚴重之麵粉恐慌問題即可解決，</p>
<h3>白煤市價堅俏</h3>
<p>白煤來貨稀少，並値天氣酷寒，銷路極為旺盛，市氣堅俏。鴻　塊成交價已昂達一百七十萬元，烟煤因民營工廠所用配煤一萬八九千噸，最近期內即可配出，市况較為虛軟，然喊價均未肯低</p>
<h3>放款不允轉期　頭寸仍然緊俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市近日頭寸之緊，起因於上週六限制提存之　　　存戶在假日前，分向各行莊提存。故各行莊頭寸，大批外流，交換時頗感緊俏。本週一時又以中信局紡建公司等拋售物資，又收縮大批頭寸。週一各行莊交換結果，四行兩局差進頭寸達二百餘億元之鉅。昨日稍見好轉，惟四行二局亦僅差出十億元而已。聞四行二局近日對各項到期放款均未允轉期。陸續收回之頭寸為數亦鉅，故市面頭寸，遂感緊俏萬分云。</p>
<h3>對日易貨事宜　仍在繼續辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理政府對日易貨事宜，本年要求向日輸入窰木一千萬根，惟日本僅能供應四百萬根，又日本人造絲，我亦要求繼續供應，惟悉可能供應之數量或不多。蓋日本存貨已罄新貨生產不多故也。此外尙須自日輸入交通器材若十。日本則要求我國供給食鹽一百萬噸，現擬供應七十餘萬噸。迄目前為止，已運出五萬噸云。</p>
<h3>米糧到貨暢旺　早稻跌進十萬關　麵粉市況萎靡生油續瀉</h3>
<p>昨日米糧來貨統計，破數月來紀錄。南市塲到二二八四，一四六石，北市塲到九六二四石，總共到一萬二千石光景，各路來源湧旺。際此政府執行經濟緊急措施方案，對民生食糧，決從嚴管理。更兼銀根緊迫，貨主求脫心切，而本街仍多觀望，去化不爽，交易平淡，市勢節節下降。厚薄粳均續挫五六千元，各檔秈米下挫三四千元，蔭變元亦跌五六千元，常錫粳價在十一萬二千元，由次早稻已跌進十萬關內，北市價較南市為低廉。</p>
<p>麵粉　再吿下十落，蓋以米市續疲，市氣萎弱，廠配粉不斷配出，實銷似感阻滯，塲內賣氣濃厚。但受主缺乏，成交仍稀，市價步削不已。晨開兵船粉五萬元，利朗洋粉七萬元，微均跌二千元，僅有少數交易。後市形勢允虛，午收利朗洋粉跌進七萬元，為六萬八千五百元，兵船粉聞四萬八千元尙有進戶，實際較上日跌三四千元，麩皮隨粉市帶疲二千元左右。小麥脚地甚堅，但無成交。</p>
<p>食油　承連日之疲勢，加之社會局嚴密監視，塲外人心虛怯，交易寥寂。原料（生仁黃豆）步跌，客商及散戶紛紛求售，但銷化呆滯，生油價跌二萬元左右，最後簍生油約跌到二十萬元邊，豆油市亦降萬餘元。小車蔴油下挫萬元，本廠生菜油退至廿三萬五千元。</p>
<p>雜糧　均吿不振，黃豆各路到源不寂，去化動而不暢，繼續猛跌三四千元，平湖豆亦瀉五六千元。生仁供多求少，下降萬元上下。芝　因中植廠盡量開出，價下瀉二萬元。赤豆行情續跌四千元，菉豆客銷緩和，亦回落萬元。紅糧苞米均步退二千元，豆餅各方走銷狹隘，價削落二千元。獨蠶豆在各貨疲落聲中，喊價反見挺昻，惟無交易。</p>
<h3>紗市客銷沉靜</h3>
<p>昨日紗市仍無起色，客銷依然沉寂，銀根緊迫如故。四十二支以下各種紗綫復降二一十萬，特雙馬始則跌至三百六十萬，繼以粵帮路有吸納，迄收市時回升至三百九十五萬，反較昨好起十餘萬元。然人心仍未見樂觀。</p>
<h3>廠商購回棉紗　作價辦法規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紡管會消息：（一）各廠因自用織布，而必須購回棉紗之作價辦法，將按照各廠出售棉紗通知書，送到紡管會之日起，以第四日紡建代營處牌價辦理。（二）各廠出售棉紗通知書，送訪管會後，因經核定等級手續關係，在三日內未能辦完，則第四天先付收購紗價之大數，免各廠週轉不　。（三）檢騐棉紗品質方法，原定檢騐標凖八種，現決定第八項包紮包　一項，不列入檢騐標準內。又第六項絞紗內容，第七項絞紗圈長，亦暫不列入。迨四月一日起，再行恢復列入云。</p>
<h3>洋麵一批到埠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕麵粉昨有到埠，保利公司代理之大順輪，係物資供應局在加所購之新輪，昨日首次批滬，由溫哥華裝來麵粉三千四百五十包，該粉係中信局採購。</p>
<h3>央行調整各地匯率　重慶行莊請增匯額未准</h3>
<p>金鈔風潮聲中，各地申匯均起劇變，各公司行莊紛紛調款來滬，搶購物資及金鈔，匯費每千有增至百元以上者，自政府宣布經濟緊急措施方案後，各地銀根反為轉緊，頃據此問中國銀行所接報吿，靑島為四十元，漢口為二十元，廣州二十元至卅元，溫州最高為一百一十元，較官訂匯率相左過鉅，中央銀行特斟酌各地市塲情形，於十七日規定四行兩局匯往各地匯率，福建廣東浙江等區均予調整，有高一倍者，福建區廈門福州兩地，均為廿八元，較增三元，其他各地仍為卅元，廣東區汕頭為五十元，增十元，其他各地為五十元，增五元，山東區十元，增五元，湖北區僅漢口武昌為五元，增三元，浙江區僅溫州為廿五元，增十元，至山西貴州雲南四川陝甘　靑西康綏遠新疆河北廣西安徽等區，均無變動，又由央銀行前以重慶各地商業行莊紛紛請求增加申匯匯額，該行仍維持原有規定，因各商帮來滬購貨，上海方面可做押匯，各地可向國家行局請匯。</p>
<h3>工業原料趨疲</h3>
<p>自外滙匯率調整以後，工業原料前日竟無做開，市况亦極紊亂。昨日以根銀轉緊，市價除硫酸稍升外，餘均趨疲。月牌燒碱價為六百萬元，美貨燒碱五百八十萬元。月脾純碱，曾一度每袋漲至五十萬元，今市三十五萬元有做開。麥加利純碱由二十八萬元跌至二十二萬元，甘油，下跌廿萬元，每聰喊價為一百五十萬元。漂粉精每補由二百六十萬元跌至二百萬元，椰子油由八十萬元一担跌至五十五萬元。各物脚地甚堅，下降程度甚微。</p>
<h3>豬鬃盤價未開　出口價則頗合算</h3>
<p>滬市猪鬃，以到貨稀少，出口價格，復難與內地價相脗合。昨日外滙滙率提高後，行商以滬巿開價，尙須待產地情形之如何而定，故迄晚尙無盤價開出。據業中人云；重慶廿七號　國外行市，紐約交貨每磅價為美金二元七角，每司馬担（即一箱一三三磅）的合國幣四百廿萬元。漢口十七號鬃，每磅價為四元一角，每司馬担約合國幣六百五十萬元。上海十七號鬃，每磅為二元，約合國幣三百廿萬元。除去稅繳水脚外，照國內現價已可提高不少</p>
<h3>桐油喊價混亂</h3>
<p>桐油市况，以廣州方面走私猖獗，故正常輸出，己與市價背道而馳，各地存底亦極稀薄。湘漢桐油產區之桐油，幾完全經粵漢路而至廣州，轉運香港。本市之桐油出口，僅中植廠有小量輸出。各行商以來源旣無，出口價格，又不相符，且市價以產地迭報漲訊，冉冉上升。昨市以外匯提高，以最近紐約電報價格，每磅紐約交貨為三角七分半美金，已將出口價値提高至每担（一二一磅）五十萬元，出口前途似乎已呈樂觀。昨喊價有高至每担四十五萬元者，較上週六每担三十八萬，已上漲八萬元，但正式行情仍無法做開。</p>
<h3>滙率調整以後　羊毛出口有望</h3>
<p>滬地羊毛價格迄乏正式做開，而產地毛價，聞已略形喊高，惟前往收購者甚為寥寥，本春羊毛吒產季節，尙須一個月以後，故目前產地存毛，仍為去年秋貨，此次外匯改訂後，在滬即可出口之羊毛，計約一萬担，此問某皮毛行接　國外來電，因寄往之羊手樣品，目前僅能供製造毛毯等用途，故其出價每磅凈貨為四角二分，如係毛貨（即未加整理揀選之貨品）則須以六折計價，但據該業中人談，按該項價格折算，其已運坁國外而未出售，及本市之存貨羊毛，如國外實銷良好，已可稍形獲利，而儘量出售，惟今後情形須視產地價格漲至若何程度，及國外價格是否低落而定。</p>

<h3>塘樓卅里香雪海</h3>
<p>— 杭州十日訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>在春來臨的時候，生活在西子湖濱的人們，與那想到西子湖來遊玩的人們，都會勾起對梅花的戀念來，恐怕在這混濁的世界，只有梅，還是保持她的純潔淸高，不畏霜雪，象徵我中華民族艱苦奮鬥不撓不屈的精神，記者爲了要報道梅的消息，已三度訪林處士的故居—孤山，二度到靈峯，但春梅還址妮着不肯露臉呢：八日，和幾個朋友盪着划子再上孤山，還像沒有開的消息，放鶴亭賣茶的婦人吿訴我；「天氣暖了，她會慢慢地放的。」九日，決心上塘棲超山去探梅。因爲到塘棲去的三岔路口沒有標識，差一點把我們送到海寗，重又回來，尋問路人，好容易踏上去塘棲的路，公路顚簸得很厲害，幾座橋樑還可以看出，戰前建造的考究路上碰見幾輛交通處的客車也搖搖擺擺的走着，我想路應該要修一修的路口應該釘一塊顯著的標識牌，使以後仰慕梅花的人不致錯走了路。</p>
<p>富庶之鎭水菓產區</p>
<p>講到塘樓，這是一個較大的富庶之鎭，這裏以水菓著名於時，運河橫貫全境，港汶紛岐，地多於田，人民多以採賣水菓爲生，馳名的塘棲枇杷，年可產八九萬祖，梅子可產十二三萬担，藕可產三四萬祖，其他楊梅，桃子，甘庶，荸薺，櫻桃都有很大的產量。枇杷分紅白兩種，其白沙枇杷觸指即穌，不易外運。藕則墜地即粉碎，嫩不可言。我意白沙枇杷如此之嫩，眞是珍貴，今後應在運輸上設法改良，務期此甜美的枇杷，不致單爲塘棲人所享受。其他的水菓都行銷滬，蘇，杭各地。塘棲鎭上有一家彙昌老店，專製蜜餞的水菓，生意鼎盛，後來蘇滬各地都來採購。有的採購生的水菓，携歸自製。上海冠生國特爲製造陳皮梅而來塘棲闢築梅林，蘇州張祥豐也每年設行來搜購梅子。今年上海的梅林公司要在塘樓設廠，專爲製造蜜餞的水菓罐頭。</p>
<p>塘棲人旣多以水菓爲生，去年水菓的銷路還不壞，所以這强烈的倒風差幸沒有波及，但因着全國普遍不景氣的影響，不免也顯得外强中乾了。</p>
<p>我們請當地人陪伴折返超山，的六華里許，伴遊的人吿訴我：「這幾天絡繹不絕的車子，他們都來探梅，以爲正月就應該開梅花了，那裏知道超山的梅花，要在驚蟄以後。」超山的梅花，稱爲家梅，家梅則結實大。如孤山靈峰的梅，是野梅，野梅者早熟而結實小。此地的梅區是以超山大明堂爲中心，東啣泰山。屯里·西南至獨山·前村·北達龜山東西兩村，馬鞍·黃姑·白栗諸山，沿東稼橋泉漳而跨交溪，環繞的可三十餘里，縱橫交錯，約百萬樹，花開時香聞十里以外，花徑迤邐，鷄鳴犬吠，有世外桃源風趣，書畫家吳昌碩愛此聖潔之地，故有「梅花我所愛，死葬超山地」之句，吳歿後，卜葬於此，有墓誌銘爲章炳麟撰，于右任所書，另有吳氏石像，手作書卷，俯瞰梅花。</p>
<p>寺側宋梅寺前梅林</p>
<p>我們被引至大明堂，有報慈寺，寺前梅樹數十幹，枝頭芽苞方吐，尙未着花，寺側宋梅一枝，半已枯老，半則還生趣盎然，孤撑石上。梅前築有宋梅亭，吳昌碩等均有題聯。這宋梅的芽苞，似較他樹爲大，開花多六出，逈異常梅，她已閱盡人間的禍亂辛酸，至今仍保持着靑春氣槪，不啻使意志頹喪的人一個很大的警惕。</p>
<p>進報慈寺，登香海棋，俯視樓前一片梅林，待梅花藝放之時，正似駕一葉舟，徜徉香海之上，那時一切俗念全消，重起一種大公無我的精神來。樓上掛康有爲所書中堂並聯，均爲讀譽此偉大的香雪海。下樓，曲折盤旋，拾級抵後殿，殿內供觀自在石刻畫碑一方，筆力蒼勁，姿態如生，原來是唐吳道子手筆，兩邊綴一聯，爲俞曲園題：「佛石不磨唐筆墨，仙梅猶占宋年華」。足徽唐畫宋梅之猶在啊！</p>
<p>伴遊的人吿訴我：「戰前公路旁也有甚多梅枝，被敵僞斫伐掉了」。我想今後還可繼續植桃梅兩種，甚至這條二十多公里長的公路，都可以植桃梅，使遊人按梅索徑，完成一個偉大的風景區。</p>
<p>我曾研究爲何超山有如此多的梅花，據考宋室南渡，在今之杭州建都，宋福王妃建別業於塘棲，超山應是梅園所在。　這些古典，詳載在杭縣或是塘棲的志畫，我們不必去深切地考據，可是我們認識塘棲地方是一個廣大農塲，水利土壤條件都很優越，梅子又是大家的農產品，倘能够提倡改良，不特可以造成風景區，並旦可利用這筆財富，來充實農村經濟。</p>
<h3>西安春寒</h3>
<p>— 二月十日西安航訊　本報西安記者李馳</p>
<p>過了「陽關」過「陰關」，過了「元脊」過「立春」，是春天了，而和暖的春陽老躱在陰雲裏，昨天下了寸把厚雪，名符其實的春寒，依然罩籠着古城長安。</p>
<p>「年」是「關」；一年中除了兩個元且外，一般人還有三百六十五個生活難關。舊話重提：這個「陰關」對好些闊佬們本來極不好過，因爲「陽關」時由四行借來救命的廿億貸金要在「陰關」前淸還，好呌人担心瀰漫各地的「倒風」會不會吹進關中。不怕，意想不到的「解救」來了，隴海鐵路東邊不通，消息傳來，一切滬貨美貨的市値有如脫繮馬，釜中蝦，跑的跑，跳的跳。金子不落後，四十萬，近「五」關，斬「六」將，過「七」仙。一萬五囤下來的麵當前五六萬不賣而眼看着要漲到七八萬，折台籌碼等於「和四番」。……撥算盤的人由着急而發笑了。新年鑼鼓，元宵花燈，街頭上像是一片天下太平好景！</p>
<p>春節不鬧</p>
<p>可惜說太平而烽烟遍地，　好景而不景難瞞。外國人以聖　禮物傾銷額看作景氣指標，依仝理，中國人新春元宵佳節的消費，也可衡量出社會購買力的高下。今春賣年貨的商人個個搖頭，無論批發的或街旁賣花砲的小販。「上元」的燈市擠得車水馬龍，但最吃香的依然是最低廉的小燈籠，老鄕們循例買一個就算了。一元宵」照往年要連鬧三夜，而今年僅有頭一晚才有幾個火花冷落地點綴在春寒的夜空。小孩們不够癮，大人們在緬懷去年前的元宵夜。</p>
<p>性質有知上海城隍廟的西安民樂園一帶，今年蕭索地渡過本該熱烘烘的春節。說書塲在大好節日下午二三時左右，僅有一兩個喝得起六百元一杯淸茶客在座。台上一排大鼓姑娘的饑餓眼睛哪裏找到獵獲物呢？在其旁的四等公娼區，茅草棚頂上尙有積雪未消，以兩三斤麵粉的代價即可做成買賣的「肉市」就燒不起炭火盤。是燃燒起馬糞的臭烟，刺激得倚門待「沽」的她們兩眼淌淚麽？到處一片冷！</p>
<p>生活暗影</p>
<p>生活的暗影寸步不離的在追踪，一月份物價指數公布了：以廿六年上半年平均作爲基數一百計，則今年一月西安躉售物價指數是一百一十三萬，零售物價指數一百一十二萬。再看西安區公務員生活指數，今年一月份的比民二十六年上半年增加了一萬三千三百倍！這是一個値得施政當局深思熟慮的數字，無情的數字。照中央現行的標準給與，西安區公敎人員生活補助費是十一萬元，加薪七百五十倍。硬磞繃的數字擺在眼前，十一萬元的補助金僅僅等於戰前的八塊錢，叙薪一百元而目下收入的七萬五千元，亦祗折合戰前五元六角！合計起來，一百元薪額的人，現在雖然通貨膨漲到十八萬五千元，而在西安換成實物，僅相當戰前的十三元六角。普通人有五口之家，每人平均核實可得二元七角正，數字如此，用不着任何說明了！</p>
<p>這學期的中學生繳費增至十二萬，一度曾謠傳過說二十萬。即使二十萬，亦不過相當戰前十五元，　理並不算多，但記者眼見着一位老敎師今春却無法繼續供給他的兒女入中學了。念書的人出不起這麽大的負担，敎書的人收了這份月薪不够開支，這一個脫節，其影響實在並不簡單，其惡果可能繼續到一二十年代。</p>
<p>西安區公敎人員一再呼籲，因爲此間物價旣然趕及京滬，而待遇却排在全國第三級，這不合理的歧視，按以上數字作證，實有改善的必要。</p>
<p>工商方案</p>
<p>全國性的工商業危機果眞不會逆襲陝西麽？當然不會例外，問題不過遲早與程度。本市工商界人士今天就在市商會舉行座談會，共籌挽救方案。會中擬定了好幾條具體辦法，主要是：（一）援照京滬先例，由本市商業銀行錢莊八十餘軍位，組織「貸款銀團」，向四行承貸鉅款，轉行放給中小型商業，（二）數額，分配，辦法，手續等由工商業先組機構擬定，經銀錢業覆核。（三）銀錢業設立準備庫；（四）貸款抵押品，無論機器或製成品貨品均可；（五）大型商工業不得申請此種貸款。……</p>

<h3>老母悼美軍　王陵基贈瓷慰情</h3>
<p>— 南昌十二日訊</p>
<p>江西省主席王陵　，近接美國一老太太來函稱：渠之子麥克冷蘭於中國抗戰時期，駕C-10機協助地面部隊作戰，在江西上空陣亡，聞贛省將創設國瓷窰，要求贈該窰出品一件，以資紀念，藉舒晚年思子之餘痛。</p>
<p>現在這位老太太所希望得到的瓷器已經出窰了，是項瓷器是由王陵基主席託浮梁縣政府代爲設法所羅致，瓷器一共是四件，計瓷瓶一對，瓷碗一對，坯子俱是頂上成品，瓶高七市寸，口徑二市寸，身寬三市寸；碗高二市寸，口徑四市寸，瓶子全面除各留繪畫地位二處外，全身圖案，均仿乾隆御窰弔燈洋蓮錦地，瓶上四幅繪畫，均爲蒼鷹，一題高瞻遠矚，一題氣塞蒼冥，碗薄如紙，色白如玉，上繪三雄並立圖，瓶口瓶底碗口碗底皆抹赤金，精美絕倫。担任繪飾工作者，爲景德鎭名畫家劉雨岑先生。</p>

<h3>關中大門雖然敞開　却仍想閉「關」自守</h3>
<p>從辦法經過「公文施行」而實現，最順利恐怕還有一個時期。即使實現了。也不過是「頭痛醫頭」的枝節應急，而不是澈底的對策，在報上有人主張着要設法先使西安的工商活動與京滬經濟中心的關聯，减至最低限度。而事實上西安最近有過好些時間不能匯款到上海，怕就是這種「理論」的具體措置。其後果我們立刻看到了：黑市匯費突漲，增加了商工界成本，消費者負擔。關中的大門敞開着，但有人却想閉「關」自守。</p>
<p>近來市上好像在流行不易判斷的謠言，傳聞與報導。幾天前一家夜報以「太原情况不明」做大標題，而某報昨天「遙遙相對」的以「攻入臨沂」爲頭條。此外有人用「靜靜地吿訴你」的語調，談及陝北碉堡綫之南的洵化。三原。宜君幾縣屬怎樣怎樣，又有人述說秦嶺以北整屋縣和陝南的商縣的什麼什麼，說得好像歷歷如繪。但上頭的新聞政策是不變應萬變。……</p>

<h3>熊式輝　在贛省故鄕談東北現勢</h3>
<p>— 廿本日南昌航訊　本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>熊天翼主任，這次由東北赴京述職之便，返贛原籍掃墓。他爲了接受辭別數載的江西父老的熟誠迎接，參加過多次公開的歡迎會，公宴，並接見了各方友好。前天他在省府紀念週上，報吿東北的一般情形，這些資料，雖然不斷在新聞紙上看到，但是，出自主持東北一般實際工作者的公開談話，還算是較翔實的第一次。</p>
<p>熊氏首先談到日本毓治東北的情形。他說：「日本統治東北十四年，它一貫的政策，是把東北日本化，所以一切的設施，均照着道個方針做的。軍事方面，當然加緊對蘇的警備，治安維持，極爲注意，在東北具有歷史的「紅鬍子」匪，在日本統治的重要地區，亦不敢出來活動，對於歸順的老百姓，則絕對保障其生活的安全。在政治方面，所採用的一切方式，均爲便於管制，最多劃東北爲廿一省，後又改爲十四省，地區有大有小，政府組織，亦各有其相當的編制，對事務官則絕對加以保障，薪金都是由中央發給，鄉鎭保甲組織，均頗健全。</p>
<p>談到接收東北的經過，他追述了一段有關東北的外交往事。他首先說明：前年開羅會議；曾有聲明，東北應應歸還中國，在日本未降之前，政府曾派兄弟赴蘇聯商洽，共同對日作戰問題，適同年八月日本宣佈投降，當時王外交部長，與其所訂中蘇友好同盟條約，蘇聯並重申尊重中國在東北主權後，兄弟返重慶，即派往東北，負責辦理接收工作。　他將這段艱難困苦的工作，劃分四個階段：（一）外交接收階段。（二）軍事接收階段。（三）政治接收階段。（四）軍事與政治接收階段。現在是接收工作停頓的階段，在外交接收階段，因交涉上的種種困難，而宣吿結束，在軍事接收階段，則我方以軍事力量，從共軍手中收回錦州，四平，長春等重要城鎭。在政治接收階段，則以共黨無商談誠意，毫無進展，現因軍事須受停戰協定的限制，而政治商談，又多擱淺，故接收工作，暫吿停頓。我軍在東北實力，相當雄厚，對共軍佔絕對壓倒優勢，蘇聯亦與我甚爲友好，將來東北能否全部接收，尙有待於我中央政府的決策。</p>
<p>東北的現在狀况，據熊氏談接收的幾個省份，都漸上軌道。就軍事方面看，除國軍分駐各重要地點，暫取防守的姿態外，正努力建立各省縣的保安團隊，加以嚴格訓練，並對於民衆組訓，力圖嚴密化，以阻遏土匪的流竄。政治方面，省縣組織從去年十二月起，一律恢復中央規定的各項設置，現已接收吉林，遼北，遼寗，安東等四省，並已順利推行政令。財政稅收，自今年起開始征收，每元收二斗高梁，相信將來東北各省，縣財政，均不致感窘迫。同時設立訓練機構，以訓練各級政治幹部。經濟方面，所接收約有三部份：（一）廠鑛資產。（二）物資，（三）房地產。以上三項，大部份皆已接收完畢，交通亦已大致恢復。敎育方面，高等敎育，已恢復者，有東北大學，長春大學，長春師範學院，瀋陽醫學院等。各中小學，亦均恢復上課，惟師資多不健全，現正設法訓練大批優良敎師，以應當前需要。</p>
<p>最後，熊氏就東北與江西有關的提出幾點意見：（一）中國必需走上工業化，江西現在已推行五年建設計劃，其中心亦在發展工業，東北的工業設備，雖然經過共黨的破壞，和蘇聯搬走一部份，但是，現在還留有規模，江西應培養工業技術人才，可逕派優秀工業新進人才，至東北各廠實習。（三）東北工業出產品，可供江西使用，江西的特產如茶葉等，東北亦迫切需要，可相互流通。（三）東北過去在敵「滿」統治期間，政治上也有些優點，如下：（一）縣長對人民生活甚爲注意，如治安衛生等，辦理極認眞。（二）對於人民征稅，多用先予後取的原則，必先協助人民生產與增產。（三）發展公營事業，以充裕財政收入等，均足供吾人採擇施行云。</p>

<h3>美麗的山城</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>抗戰第二年的夏天，我從漢口流播到重慶時，曾在文協總會的會刋上寫過一篇通訊，為要吿訴滯留漢　的作家們不必視屬遭為畏途，故意標出一個誘惑性的題目——美麗的山城，極盡歌頌的能事。在那時，我也略嫌過份，到今天偶翻舊稿，深覺不够，我還得賡續八年前的題目——美麗的山城，再寫下去。</p>
<p>這一座嘉陵江揚子江環繞的山城，誰能否認牠是風暴中的燈塔，抗戰的司令台，而與華盛頓，倫敦，古比雪夫有着同等的重要，甚至更重要些呢！沿着舊有的城圈所周延的範圍內，雖沒有因勢乘便，把牠鑿成天然的花園；但你祗要步出城郊，或渡江至江北和南岸，不論那一處的山陵，岩石，溫泉，古蹟，如果搬移到江南去，定能被詩人騷客歌詠風頌，驚為天下奇蹟的。記得在富時胡風兄也在大公報的一戰綫」上，寫了一篇關於山城的感想；但他看不出山城的美麗究在那裏，好像我欺騙了他似的。勝利後，他早就飛到上海了，當他回憶山城，再寫一篇關於山城的感想時，也許，他的看決，不同從前一樣了。</p>
<p>山城在戰時，曾擠滿了形形色色的人物，有些被日寇追逐着不得已而來此避難的江南人，常誇江南好，江南勝於崎嶇的蜀中這，當春秋佳日，紅杏花開，綠楊啼鳥，可以泛西湖的華舫，賞鄧尉的臘梅，摘玄武的靑運，踏棲霞的紅葉，江南，縈繞在江南人的夢憐，八年了，旣已聽到祝捷的炮竹，胡不歸！我的家，也在江雨太湖邊，並不在東北松花江上，而我却還是留戀着美麗的山城。</p>
<p>美麗的山城！中華民族在你的羽翼衛護下，渡過了最後的關頭，不知有多少英勇的鬥士，慷慨的豪傑，毀家紓難的義民，寫下血淋淋的史篇；然也有無數的魔鬼，在這裏散佈瘟疫，製造罪惡，使你蒙受不潔，今天，你顯得更淸靜，更美麗了！</p>
<p>人，都歡喜「爭名於朝，爭利於市」，這與牛羊的擇水草而棲何以異。我的故鄉，現己變成名利的淵藪，我怕見那些爭名逐利者的臉譜，我又躭心一般被踐踏的昆蟲，將在他們的脚底下粉身碎骨。今年新春，多承江南的朋友們萬里寄書，探問歸期，那一片感懃的盛意，縱能挑逗我的遐想；但引領東望，不知人間何世，還是在高高的山城，靜觀正在演變中的此象吧！</p>
<p>噫！歲月催人老而嫩，一股勇往直前的英雄氣槪，已在八長年的戰時，一年又半的和平苦待中，消磨殆盡了！看到悠悠風塵中的奔競之士，北飛燕，南走吳，或則觀光於「上國」，講學於「彼美」，不惜拋却憂患餘生，沉浸在茫茫人海中，赤膊肉搏，捨命游泳，撈捕生存的資源，我祇有欽敬他們的「鬥志」，自愧在人生的戰塲上，已是敗北的懦夫了！然也有些年富力强，自命為銅筋鐵骨的好漢們，歸去並不遲暮，「鬥志」豈落人後，而屢次來書，痛述遭遇，唏噓泣涕，不能自已，幾有「上天無門，入地無路」之概，那麼，像我這樣落落寡合，一無憑藉的人，怎不望而却步呢！幸而今天的山城還不至於如此，多數人都沒有喪失人與人之間所應有的同情，大家不採用「損人利己」的毒心腸，還是講眞話，憑良心，忠厚行事，在元宵之夜，都還能無憂無慮，堆着滿臉的微笑，欣賞獅十籠燈在跑跳，縱也有少數不知趣的人，想利用街頭人多的機會，舉行反什麼的宜傳，就是說得舌敝唇焦，上氣不接下氣，好像遠不及一條紙糊的龍燈，一隻形似的獅子，在街路上連跑帶跳，更能引人人勝呢！</p>
<p>山城的早春，因有羣山作屏，西伯利亞的寒流，縱已流過河套，影響平津，漸趨中原，但不會光顧山城。這裏的二月問，也有一度「桐花寒」，然不至於像江南春寒的難受。奇怪，「霧季」已是習慣上的名詞了，冬天老是一團鮮艷的大太陽，如同一個天然的火爐，溫暖着山城，溫暖着衆人的身，住在這裏的人，他們的心，不會冷酷到結了冰一樣，對於太陽的提早出現，我想是有關係的。春來，田野是一片靑葱，荳苗的花蔓，是數不淸的翩翻飛舞的蝴蝶，彷彿盪漾在百樂門的舞姬，賣花的街上，有的是花，什麼花都有。大自然曾試用理髮師的技巧，使阡上的幼麥，整理得異常均勻，在春風和煦中如同少女們的柔髮似的　起有風情的波紋。曾有多少痴男情女，在那裏決鬥，情殺，設香巢，充滿着浪漫史的南山裏，松風如濤，野卉齊放，已有季候烏鼓動如算的歌喉，在林子裏舉行音樂會了。叢生在幽谷裏的茶樹，也開花了，田父野老都在摘取新芽，焙乾以後，泡以沸滾的淸泉，何遜於西湖的龍井。我在新春閒暇，曾的二三知己蕩舟於南泉的小溪，兩岸潴積的新雨，流向溪河衷，幻成白色的銀鍊，如萬千龍蛇在游走。在南泉潔身歸來，洗凈了身心的塵垢，也减輕了肩上的重壓，冷然然御風而行，眞好像不知人間有憂患事，飄飄欲仙似的。山城是美麗的；但也祗有我們這些無牽無掛，無爭無求的人，才能欣賞牠的美麗。</p>
<p>在這裏，我怕聽從江南傳來的消息，每一個消息，都是使人驚心動魄的。我們是浮游的水烏，到晚上，都在楊子江邊，尋覓自己的歸宿。這一條江流，好此是一條長蛇，你們在「吳頭」，我們在「楚尾」，雖也有一段距離，然而沒有超出蛇身的長度，吳頭楚尾，息息相關，我之不能忘懷江南，正如我之關心住在江南的朋友們是一樣。</p>
<p>春天來了，春天帶給人們的是然望與幸福。在這裏我謹敬地為朋友們祈禱，願你們放懷達觀，自求多福，人生幾何，有如朝露，何必苦苦地你爭我奪，彼蒼者天，像預知人類總逃不了有一個悲慘的結局，特於年年春天，舖成一片錦繡，供人剷覽，願大家惜取大好春光，切莫辜負大自然的厚惠。</p>
<h3>母親的旅行</h3>
<p>— 陳因譯</p>

<h3>英國文壇雜訊</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>曾被郁達夫介紹而且翻譯過小說的奧弗拉赫德（Liam　O’Flaherty）新近出版了一本小說「土地」（Land）。這小說頗近於鬧劇，故事活潑而且有力。</p>
<p>撒克微兒　絲特（V．Sackville-West）小姐新近出版了一本詩集「花園」（The　Garden），詩葩了。</p>
<p>去年赫欽生書屋（The　House　of　Hutchinson）出版了一本「蕭伯納九十歲」，是一部集體著作，執筆者有：畢爾邦（Sir　Max　Beerbohm），唐珊南（Lord　Dunsany），霍士曼（L．Housman），熊式一，赫克胥黎（Aldous　Huxley），麥斯斐爾（J．Masfield），威爾斯等。當時威爾斯還不曾去世。這本書附有彩色插圖，大部分都是蕭伯納自己的集藏。</p>
<p>美國亨克來（Laura　L．Hinkley）小姐曾得過加里福尼亞文學金章獎，因為她寫了一本書，論到英國過去的女作家「白倫特姊妹」（Cqarlotte　and　Emnlly，The　Brontes），談到她們倆的jane　Eyre和Wuthering　Heights。後者曾經趙清閣女士改編為劇本「此恨綿綿」。同一作者還寫了一本「文　女性」（Ladies　of　Li，erature），論到英國的許多女性作家如奧斯坦，白倫特姊妹，白朗寗夫人，愛里阿特等。</p>
<p>巴克（Jamess　Barke）計　　三本小說談到彭斯（Robert　Burns）。這一位蘇格蘭詩人將因巴克的叙述而益顯，我們除了知道他是一個農民詩人外，又可以知道他的先世，十八世紀蘇格闌的情形，彭斯的少年時代。彭斯的父　勞作不体，鄕村敎師把文人的作品介紹給彭斯。他母親把甜蜜的民歌唱給他聽，老　特·大衛生（Betty　Daoidson）將　故事和謠曲也請給他聽，使他得到豐富的材料。「蘇格蘭人甜的舌頭流下甘蜜來，」這一切都記錄在巴克的三部曲第一卷「搖撼大麥的風」（The　Wind　that　Shakes　the　Barley）裏面。</p>
<h3>祝福</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>——為赴美就學友人作</p>
<p>漫長人生的歲月中，雖然妳一直度着那小布爾喬亞的美滿生活，妳是父母的寵兒，全家的天之驕子；可是，妳確一點沒有大家閨秀的驕氣，更沒有染上都市小姐奢侈浮滑揮金如土的惡習慣，憑着這一點，妳可以在千百萬人羣面前驕傲，同時，這驕傲唯一的表現，就是妳今日能決心暫時拋棄美滿的天倫之樂，而毅然決然遠步重洋去再求進一步的深造。為着妳的前途，也為着國家多造就一個人才！我特地寫這篇文章來祝福妳未來成功。</p>
<p>會經在一個傍晚，妳告訴了我許多意想不到的經歷，使我無法來形容當時對妳的敬佩；直到現在，還深深的印在我的心坎裏，留下了永恆的憶念。六年前，正是太平洋戰事爆發，敵寇進入租界，祗不過十六歲的妳，竟不顧一切隻身投入祖國的懷抱—到金華去。這非凡的精神正表示妳的勇氣，這勇氣不僅是與妳同樣家庭環境的女孩子所未有，即使一個普通的男孩子，也不容易做出如此冒險的事。惟其妳是一個女孩子，更顯出妳堅韌無比。所以，今天妳能放棄享樂的生活到美國去，在那陌生人羣中尋找孤寂與枯燥的氣氛。我相信妳的決心，我敬偑妳的堅毅，為了鼓勵妳，也為了增加妳的更氣，我祝福妳前途無量，鵬程萬里。</p>
<p>如今，祖國漫天烽火，和平的福音是如何的渺茫，在這充滿了金屬冶豔氣氛的都市裏，一個普通的大學生是不足為奇的，社會上沒有妳的插足之地，也沒有妳所追求的理想環境，妳好似滄海一粟，隨波逐浪，不知道什麼時間都可以被巨浪打沉。因此，妳是社會的遺棄者，為了逃避現實，妳很敏明地離開了這個社會；轉瞬間，妳將離開祖國，離開這繁華的都市，獨自跨越重洋，去到另一個新生的天地裏，呼吸那健康的空氣，我祝福妳此行一帆風順，早日學成歸國，為妳，為祖國，創造新的天地。</p>
<p>當妳回來的時候，我希望，祖國再聽不到槍砲聲，再聞不到火藥的氣味，整個的中國，是一座和平的樂園，我將在樂園的庭前等待妳歸來，等待妳奏着和平的交響曲，我祝福妳，我虔誠地投向梵帝崗前，默默的，預祝妳的成功，祝福妳帶來新的種子，新的滋潤，來培植妳的新人生，新前途，也是培植新的中國。</p>

<h3>民間的文化交流</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>古代以政治武功，開闢疆土，為文化傳輸的捷徑。如希臘亞歷山大，征服印度，但希臘主義也隨之而消沉；拿破崙侵入莫斯科，而法國文化慘淡無顏色。可見欲以政治與武力，壓迫他人的國土，毀滅他人的文物，結果自己國勢一蹶不振，徒留些誇大狂的形式，以供後人憑弔而已，惟有民間的文化交流，民問的友情互助，可以把不同的種族界限打消，把國際誤會解除。所以當初國際聯盟，設了文化合作的機構，選各國的社會賢達，不代表其國家，用意就是使民問的友情互助，彼此認識，减少誤會。不用政治力量，讓文化交流，世界和平，才可希望進步。</p>
<p>現在聯合國文化科學敎育會議，變更從前的方法，各國派定代表參加，自然也能收到許多合作的效果，如設營養中心站，掃除文盲的識字運動，種種計劃為人類謀福利。但彼此了解的力量，互助熱誠，遠不如民問的文化交流，來得直接而深切。欲帮助這種世界的合作遝動，還是要社會賢達，學術專家，道高德重的人，出來主持，出來領導。人民與人民，才能團結得堅賣，張伯苓從美國回來，滿載了中國復興的希望。有人間他將來作何事業，他表示除敎育工作外，還要盡力中美文化協會。他懇切的說，民問的文化交流，比政治外交還重要。這種實在是有遠見的卓識。世界將來，也許由這條光明的大道，走到和平的路上，眞正的文化復興，必定由各國民間合作，纔能覓到公是公非。今日我們在經濟混亂，學術荒蕪的中國，除了普及敎育發展工業之外，特別應注重民間的友情互助。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血178</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>萍子透出這個個消息，完竟是個什麼用意！？耀羣的眼光掃射了我們幾個人一眼，停在鶴見的臉上，好像要搜索鶴見心下不曾吐露的一種什麼隱秘：「她和您…」？</p>
<p>聽了躍羣這個似完未完的問句，我以第三人的地位，忽地像觸了電一般，太陽穴上的脈管，有有些突突的跳動了。他們三個人—鶴見，耀羣，萍子，—的關係，來龍夫脈，從起　到現在止惟有我一人最淸楚。</p>
<p>神經過度憲敏的人，看我把故事記到這裏必定要說筆者定是要把這一男兩女，拉扯出來，造成一叚現下流行「三角戀愛」的桃色故事，把塲面弄得熟鬧些。我對于這樣的意見，暫且不願發表什麼，只耽心用這樣眼光來看這段祀載的人，將來或許更感覺到失望哩！</p>
<p>我聽了耀羣問鶴見的話，當時有些驚異的感覺，那是替耀羣這位東北女兒的直率，和鶴見的愛窘，感到一種莫名其妙的不安，並沒有其他心事。</p>
<p>「萍子和我之問：」鶴見應聲而答，「現在維持着一個似敵非敵，似友非友的微妙為面。然而又說不上是「敵』，也說不上是「友」。在我們眼面前，即將展開的大時代大轉變上，我可以大胆說一句話—男和女這兩個字，並不能，也不應該繼繁着普通社會眼光上的那種「性」的特微—這是因為我們都是鬥士，各人都是一個鬥士的單位。說得具體些，宗旨目標不同的，就得相鬥，志趣相同的，就得携手合作，不問對方是男是女。這是一個鐵律；對準這個大時代產生的一個鐵律！」鶴見的神情上，表現着天眞，坦白，誠懇。</p>
<p>「您誤會了，古先生！」耀羣格格地笑了。「您這個理論，我記得我說在您以先，記得嗎？：我現在所要明白的，就是萍子小姐，這位『鬥士的單位，』同您的『志趣，』是相同的，還是相反的，還是似手相同而又似乎相反的？在道一點上，您有什麼切實的把握沒有？因為我現在正替您躭着心事咧…替您躭心事，也就是替我們這一羣躭心事……」</p>
<p>鶴見這可眞的窘了。不大有理解的人，窘到這個程度，也許會投河，上吊，吃安眠藥品；或是對準自已太陽或心口一槍；或是日本式的切腹，跳火山；或西洋式的割脈管，放煤氣，跳十三層樓，吞　化鉀。怎麼能把人家一片正義，誤扯到男女關係上去？還來上一大篇敎訓？</p>
<p>我似手應常替鶴見解這一圍，然而當時却有電花一閃似的一種說不出的見解，竟阻止了我出塲發話。其餘還有小虎臣，可不說一句巧妙的話，緩和這團低壓。可惜地根本沒有抓住性問題的中心，許多理論上的專門名辭，把他攪得得昏天黑地。譬如說「鬥士」這兩個字，在他的半彙中，大概應該是「桿十」，那「一個鬥士的單位」，應該痛痛快快的稅「一條桿子」，等等。他坐在這裏聽我們說話，好比一個鄕下孩子，聽一羣時髦大學生討論變愛問題，一句中國話裏，多少要參上幾固不大適用的英文字。那自然要呌這鄉下孩子莫明其妙了。所以虎臣處在這麼一個「茄門」環境裏，別說　不出一句巧妙的話，竟連呼吸都有些不大痛快。</p>

<h3>花市</h3>
<p>— 路珊</p>
<p>一談花圃·花彬·與花的季節</p>
<p>（一）春臨人間</p>
<p>春天了，但上海還在冷風裏　發抖。——這世界的大都市，春天的花朶馬上將開遍在貴婦人的胸襟上；開放在華貴美麗的街頭玻璃櫉窗裏；清供在幽靜的案頭，這些燦爛，絢麗的花朶，都能證明春天裏的冬天，—這寒峭的冬風，是不會逗留得太久的。</p>
<p>因為那些芬芳，芯香，各色的花朶，馬上會招手把眞正的春天喚來的。不相信，花圃裏，玻璃棚裏，各種各色的花卉，已經發出苞蕾，抽出綠芽，將透露出牠們最動人的色澤與香味，來表達出靑春是具有着多麼動人的豐姿。</p>
<p>（二）人工焙製</p>
<p>上海，一年四季—不管春，夏，秋，冬，十二個月裏，鮮花是從來不斷的。</p>
<p>這些花，不管是家霜秋露，或是白雪冰凍，最鮮艷的花朶，照樣開遍在上海，開遍在妝閣的花瓶裏，開遍在華貴的客廳裏。這些花大部份都是經過人工的焙養，由玻璃的花棚裏，經過花匠長久的燻焙，才强迫開放的。</p>
<p>那些結婚用的康乃馨，喇叭花，牠們不是一年四季可以貼在美麗新娘的胸襟上麼？這些花，如若不是由於人工的焙製，牠們那有這樣長的壽命？</p>
<p>（三）花市公會</p>
<p>上海的花市，大部份都集中在南市的斜橋，那裏有一個花市公會，所有全上海的花棚裏的花，都在半夜裏把花送到花市去。花市交易的時間是上午三點到五點鐘，賣花的，買花的，都在這時間交易。過了這時間，花市便散了，要等，便得等到第二天。</p>
<p>花市公會也備着可以住宿的地方，遠地花棚裏的賣主，他可以早一點把花拿去，住在花市公會裏，到一定的時間，你可以把花賣掉，公會裏只稍為收一點費用。</p>
<p>（四）花棚地區</p>
<p>全上海的花棚，一時也無從統計，他們散布的地點，大約在浦東，南市，曹河涇這些地方，一個花棚的建築費，以現在的佔計大約要四百萬元，這包括玻璃，司汀，都在內。現在，因為田地種稻榖不値錢，有了玻璃花棚，利息反而好得多。</p>
<p>在每年「淸明節」以前，全上海的鮮化，都是在玻璃棚裏用高溫度的司汀焙養出來的。</p>
<p>你常常在街頭看到的那些水紅，白色的康乃馨，黃色，紫紅巴的攻瑰花，外國洋柳，含豆花，……這些天多都是外國種，牠們都是在人工的玻璃棚裏非法產生的。但是，牠們，不是一樣的絢爛，一樣的美麗麼？</p>
<p>（五）花的季節</p>
<p>花的市價，也是跟季節變換的。比如這兩天，天氣冷得利害，花的市價就貴上三分之一，康乃馨一打賣一萬二，外國楊柳賣七八千，四五千一紮，喇叭花賣十二萬一打…。</p>
<p>假如你有什麼宴會，只要合乎需要，你決不會小氣買一點花裝飾一下的。</p>
<p>但是天氣如若眞的暖和了，當過了「淸明節」以後，露天的花上市了，那些不用玻璃棚焙養的天然的花朵，牠們眞的開遍人間的時候，那些用人工焙養的花價，馬上就瀉落下來。</p>
<p>那時候的鮮花，才是平民化的。你，我，不屬於貴族階級的人，也照樣可以把花瓶裝點得紅紅綠綠的。</p>
<p>不是麼？眞正的春天，那時候才眞的光臨人間了。</p>
<h3>說長短聯　—聯語新話之二—</h3>

<h3>愛的對話</h3>
<p>— 孔源</p>
<p>「柏拉圖說，謝謝天，我是一個男人，而不是女人，這句話很明顯是侮辱我們女性。」</p>
<p>「一點也不。柏拉圖希望自己成為一個强者，因為時人常說：弱者呵，你的名字呌女人。」</p>
<p>一康德為什麼終身沒有結婚？他抱獨身主義嗎？」</p>
<p>「他很想結婚。有二次都想伸出手來向女朋友求婚的，都是他的猶豫遲疑的牌氣害了他。一次是猶豫太久。她已經等不及他的決定而搬到別處去了。一次是遲疑不決，她終於愛了一個有勇氣的男人。」</p>
<p>「你主張一個男人應該很快向他的女友求婚？」</p>
<p>「你很快的二個字有語病，我的主張是，選擇你所要愛的人，不能很快。當眞正選擇到了，那就不妨很快吿訴她，你愛她。」</p>
<h3>風雨集</h3>

<p>春假甫過，做子女的伸手要錢上學，為人父母的，四五十萬·百把萬元的學膳費的籌劃，已經够使他們憑添幾莖「白髮」了。做子女的，何曾想到這些綑綑紮紮的紙幣，每一張中多有着多少憂緒煩愁！</p>
<p>房子講頂費以來，沒有房子住的人，已經把房子看得有半天高，現在經過如此在瀾的金潮，房十已變成渺茫的雲霧，更遼遠，更無從捉摸了。</p>

<p>— 果華</p>
<p>即將在國泰上映的長春樹，，是一九四三年出版的一部暢銷小說，作者倍蒂。司密斯，原名A　TreeGrowstn　Brooklyn，譯為長春樹，與內容實在非常恰當。故事寫的是布洛克林一個貧民窟中諾爾的一家子人。這一家人（尤是父親和女兒）雖然身處困苦的環境，却仍舊不失去他們的希望，正像骯髒的後院中那一顆樹，它竟能刺穿水門汀而向空中生長出來。</p>
<p>長春樹的導演，是愛理亞開賽，主演者為帕琪安珈納的茀朗茜（女兒），桃樂賽麥珈爾的嵌蒂（母親），和詹姆士鄧的張尼（父親）。生活畫報介紹說，一部暢銷的小說，製成了一個絕妙的電影，値得一看。</p>

<h3>「各有千秋」</h3>
<p>— 羅林</p>
<p>勝利後的國產影片，在找着新的路十，就題材說，以戰時淪陷區為故事的片子「忠義之家」，「鐵骨冰心」，「蔗花翻白燕子飛」，以至最近的「蒙難夫人」，為數不少，由於各影片或多或少地，犯了槪念式描叙的弊病，觀衆們看了並不感到親切。「各有千秋」就另闢蹊徑，成為日常生活的寫照，以生活裏有趣的細節，表現母女間思想的距離，女免結婚後小家庭生活的糾紛等等。</p>
<p>劇作者想把主題安置在所謂女子敎育問題上，但是他自也做不得主，他的筆端一定要觸及這個動亂的現實環境，描寫人們在實生活裏遭受的種種痛苦，可是他沒有把兩者統一起來看；女子的敎育，女子在社會上的地位，她們的職業和經濟基礎，這些問題都提出了，我們却一點不知道劇作者主歡的見解怎樣，他像帶我們兜了不少圈子。影片結尾，金碧華和楊聰一對小夫　由於經　生活的困苦，他們的幻想破滅了，他們要守過一段黑夜才能等到天亮，他們還期待過安適的日子，這是一個多乏力的結尾。金碧華和　聰倆吃了些苦，碰了不少釘子，好容易從一個　無飄渺的幻想中跳出來，難道再要他們做一個不着邊際的夢不成？我說，　　　限淚固然也有光彩，它却更多的表示了悲觀，帳望，而不是積極或奮發。</p>
<p>從主題的表現看，「各有千秋」也短少完整，然而故事裏的事件，是我們所熟悉的，單憑這一點，它會得有　　，導演朱石麟在很多片斷中，展示了他獨特的才能，金碧華在婚後去訪間四個過去的同學，插進四個片斷的描寫，不見重複，而且也讓我們放開眼去者看其他的家庭生活。從整個着眼，朱石麟也能運用秀經濟的條件攝製影片把草率的地方　　得好好的。</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th dispatch] The National Army in Southern Shandong recovered Lanling Town and Hengshan Town on the morning of the 18th. In the afternoon, they recovered Zaozhuang. The Communist New Tenth Division and the Guards Brigade, numbering about 4,500, are fleeing in a state of disarray towards the Mengshan Mountain area. On the western section of the Longhai Railway, only 30 kilometers between Liuhe and Shangqiu remain unfinished. The Xuzhou-Bian section can be open to traffic within two weeks.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 18th dispatch] The Communist troops who have retreated in Shandong are now using the two major mountain ranges of Yimeng and Culaishan as bases, redeploying and actively reorganizing in preparation for launching another offensive. More than 40,000 Communist troops have retreated into Culaishan. The National Army is closely monitoring them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th dispatch] The work of the National Army in eliminating the remaining Communist troops in Southern Shandong is nearing completion. Important strongholds such as Xiangcheng, Hongshan Town, and Lanling Town on the Taiwei Highway southwest of Linyi were captured by the National Army on the afternoon of the 18th. The three regiments of the Canal Detachment of the New Fourth Army led by Hu Daxun, which were besieged in the area, were almost completely annihilated, with few remnants, and fled to the mountainous area of Feixian.

<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 18th dispatch] The largest Communist base in central Linyi, built in Xinzhuang, northwest of Yishui, has been gradually completed. According to reliable information, when the war situation in northern Jiangsu became tense last winter in November, the Communist Party conscripted more than 3,000 civilians to build a large number of houses in Xinzhuang at the foot of Motianling, about 40 kilometers northwest of Yishui, taking advantage of the favorable terrain. Now, most of this construction has been completed. All important figures and files of the Communist Party's East China Bureau, the puppet Shandong Provincial Government, and the Shandong Military Region have been transported to the area. The puppet Shandong University in Linyi has also moved there to continue classes, and the Dazhong Daily newspaper has also moved there to be published.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 18th dispatch] The six divisions of the New Fourth Army and the Shandong Communist Liberation Division are concentrated in the Sishui, Mengyin, Feixian, and Yishui areas. Another three main regiments have been sent to the Tengxian and Zou County areas. More than 40,000 Communist troops have also arrived in Culaishan, southeast of Tai'an, actively preparing for war. Their purpose is to prevent the National Army from advancing north to open up the Jinpu Railway and to maintain the Yimeng Mountain area. Judging from the situation, a major battle will unfold on the Jinpu Line. Liu Bocheng's main force in western Shandong is concentrated between Juye and Yuncheng, with a part arriving at Zhang. The National Army in Central Shandong is still confronting the Communist troops in Bieyang Town. The National Army is sweeping away the Communist troops south of Boshan and on the highway between Mingshui and Laiwu to ensure the rear communication lines.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th dispatch] The remnants of the 20,000 troops of the Third, Great, and Seventh Columns of Liu Bocheng in western Shandong are still roaming in the Juye and Jiaxiang areas south of the Yellow River.

<p>[Our newspaper, Hefei, 18th dispatch] More than 1,000 troops and over 100 cavalrymen, the main force of the Communist troops under Zhang Taisheng, besieged Magongdian, east of Sixian, on the 16th.

Another 600 Communist infantry and cavalry have fled from the territory of Lingbi County into Yingwei, which belongs to Sixian. Another group of more than 200 Communist troops seem to be raiding Jiegou. (War news from the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is on page 2)</p>
<h3>Youth Party's List of Participants in the Government to Be Decided at Today's Central Standing Committee Meeting; Shao Lizhi Met with Dong Biwu in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper dispatch] Last night, the Shanghai-based Standing Committee members of the Youth Party held a discussion meeting at the residence of Zuo Shunsheng to exchange views on the issue of the list of participants in the government in preparation for today's Central Standing Committee meeting. When the reporter visited Mr. Zuo yesterday, he said: When he was in Beijing, he met with Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and others, all hoping that the reorganization of the government could be realized as soon as possible. The Youth Party's views on the reorganization of the government are the same as in the past, that is, it advocates the overall reorganization of the central government and the opening up of local political power. The government has expressed its agreement in principle to this. Once the list is decided, he will go to Beijing again. According to reports, Mr. Zuo and Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The issue of government reorganization will gradually unfold.

<h3>Economic Plan Submitted to the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Legislative procedures can be completed soon</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The economic emergency measures plan was submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the National Government on the 18th, so as to complete the legislative procedures in the shortest possible time. The Criminal Law, Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan are scheduled to meet on the 19th to review it.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Goods Ready; Stamps Can Begin Soon</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The detailed rules for the supply of essential living goods to public and educational personnel have been drafted and will be promulgated in a short period of time after being submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry. The ministry will not establish a special agency to handle it, but will form a Capital Public and Educational Personnel Living Essentials Allocation Committee with relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Materials Supply Bureau, the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Finance, and the Police Department, with one chairman and nine members, and a secretariat divided into several groups. There are two sales methods: (1) The distributors entrust the relevant members of the commercial guilds to distribute; (2) The distribution is carried out by the Capital Cooperative Society through its branches. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for cloth, cooking oil, and coal; the Ministry of Food is responsible for rice and flour; the Resources Committee is responsible for sugar; and the Ministry of Finance is responsible for salt. Most of the goods are in stock, but coal is more difficult. The sales price will be determined by the committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Even if purchased at a high price, it will be sold at a low price. The compensation will be paid by the national treasury. According to Long Dajun, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, all preparations for the distribution have been completed. Only the stamps to be used in the procedures have not yet been printed. Once they are printed, it can begin. It can be started as scheduled within March. Shanghai is also ready, and its organization is roughly the same as that of Beijing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government and Public Unanimously Praise Our Emergency Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 17th dispatch] All American newspapers today regard Chairman Chiang's emergency economic measures as the most important news. The headline on the front page of the New York Times today is "China Resumes Wartime Control Laws to Prevent Inflation." The World-Telegram reported: "Chairman Chiang Refreshes China's Economy," but the newspapers have not yet commented on this.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] Authoritative sources said that the U.S. government has not concealed its sympathy for Chairman Chiang's recent economic emergency measures. Chairman Chiang's emergency measures have undoubtedly won the sympathy of observers in the U.S. government and public. However, public opinion still doubts whether the Chinese government's institutions can handle this economic emergency plan competently. The conservative Evening Star was the first to comment, saying, "America's abandonment of mediation is the main factor in the recent devaluation of the legal tender." The newspaper also stated that China's economic instability is very beneficial to the Chinese Communist Party, which has always aimed to promote economic collapse in areas it does not control. Special Envoy Marshall criticized this in his statement before leaving China.</p>
<p>According to inquiries by this agency, due to Chairman Chiang's emergency measures, members of Congress have become more determined in their understanding of China, and their sympathy for the National Government has increased. Although Congress still has a dislike for a few reactionary elements in the Kuomintang, it feels that the United States must not allow China to become communist, nor can it allow the National Government to perish.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 17th dispatch] Business circles here today unanimously praised Chairman Chiang's economic emergency measures plan as a definite step. Business leaders said that they believe that the plan does not hinder importers and exporters, and that if it can be implemented, most of the regulations will be very beneficial. Business leaders expressed their approval of the abolition of export subsidies and the 50% import surcharge, believing that this move restored foreign trade to what it was a few weeks ago. Since the promulgation of the export subsidy, American importers have instructed their agents in China to suspend all business. Business leaders also said that this new economic measure is the most thorough method in China for many years and does not try to force conformity.</p>
<h3>National Defense Council Today's Routine Meeting to Discuss Constitutional Legal Regulations; Legislative Yuan Adds Fifty New Members</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The Supreme National Defense Council is scheduled to hold a routine meeting on the 19th to discuss various regulations related to the implementation of the constitution.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan will be expanded, with the addition of 50 new legislators, accounting for one-half of the current number. The Executive Yuan recently allocated 300 million yuan to the Legislative Yuan to purchase various necessary equipment.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Routine Meeting Canceled Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The routine meeting of the Executive Yuan was canceled because the President and Vice President of the Yuan, Song and Weng, and the heads of various ministries were mostly in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Thirteenth Anniversary of the New Life Movement; Chairman's Letter to Fellow Countrymen</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] On the thirteenth anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang's letter to fellow countrymen is as follows:</p>
<p>I, Zhongzheng, have advocated the New Life Movement for thirteen years now. The true essence of the New Life Movement is to awaken the self-consciousness of our people, transform our society, revive our nation, and build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong. In other words, it is to thoroughly reform everything in the consciousness, actions, and life of our people, so as to achieve the modernization of China. Looking back on the eight years of the War of Resistance, we went through all kinds of difficulties, and finally relied on the nationwide spirit to achieve victory. This shows that our national spirit and inherent morality have an indelible brilliance. Now, it has been almost two years since the victory. The external obstacles to national construction have long been eliminated, and the Constitution of the Republic of China has been formulated and promulgated. Our country is about to move towards civil politics and economic construction. All our compatriots must encourage themselves in their private lives to be modern citizens who do not fall behind, and shoulder the heavy responsibility of national security and national honor. I cannot help but express my earnest expectations on this day of this year.</p>
<p>Treat Speculators as Degenerates</p>
<p>The main purpose of the New Life Movement is to infuse etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame into the daily life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The tenets of the New Life Movement are neatness and cleanliness, simplicity and frugality, and speed and certainty. Our compatriots have long been accustomed to hearing this. In analysis, etiquette and righteousness show people the precepts of actively doing good, integrity and a sense of shame show people the scope of what cannot be done. Etiquette and righteousness encourage people not to be lazy or wasteful, integrity and a sense of shame encourage people not to speculate, not to take chances, not to be perfunctory, and not to be lucky. Being able to practice etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame will make you worthy of being a modern citizen with a sound mind and body.</p>
<p>As for the six tenets of the New Life Movement, neatness and cleanliness are the foundation for strengthening the body and managing the community. Its purpose is to enable everyone to cherish themselves and maintain their integrity. Simplicity and frugality are the principles for establishing oneself and managing affairs. Its purpose is to save money. Speed and certainty are the necessary conditions for work and production. Its purpose is diligence. Understanding these meanings, the strict implementation of the New Life Movement is not only to benefit oneself, but also to reform bad habits, restore declining customs, save the country from danger, and promote social progress. Therefore, all our compatriots should know what age this is, what time this is, and should know that all countries in the world are making rapid progress in order to seek progress. We should deeply regret why our country has so many worries and humiliations after the victory, unable to achieve peace and stability internally, and unable to maintain the respect of international friends externally. Understanding this meaning, we must deeply reflect and thoroughly awaken, we must strictly avoid empty talk and advocate hard work, we must reject hypocrisy and promote honesty, we must regard speculation as the behavior of social degenerates, and extravagance and waste as the actions of national traitors. In this time of national hardship and people's hardship, all our patriotic compatriots must take responsibility, abide by order, respect laws and regulations, and pay attention to discipline, to create an organized and orderly country. Our nation is a nation that can actively strive for progress. This is one.</p>
<p>Strictly Abide by Economic Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>The customs are declining, and this is the extreme. The suffering in the cities is particularly evident. For more than a year after the victory, we have not been able to eliminate the remnants of enemy and puppet poisoning. Luxury, extravagance, and waste are excessive. The suffering of our compatriots is ignored, and the material resources of the country are not cherished. If this is not changed for a long time, not only will national construction be hopeless, but we will also be doomed to ruin. All our compatriots should know that extravagance is the origin of national subjugation, and frugality is the foundation of national construction. We must strive for simplicity and advocate thrift. Looking at the friendly countries with abundant material resources, they still have rules for frugal clothing and food. How can our country, which is backward in production, indulge in waste, not cherish itself, and cut off the national foundation? The national economy has evolved to a serious state. Anyone who understands the general trend will know that the difficulties of this day are no less than the hard struggle of wartime. We must fully support and strictly abide by the state's laws and regulations on economic and financial control. Saving one point of material resources at this time means adding one point of glory in the future. This is two.</p>
<p>Labor-Capital Cooperation Eliminates Suspicion</p>
<p>Hands are omnipotent, the Father of the Nation's clear instruction. Production and construction are the foundation of prosperity and strength. Our country is currently experiencing dilapidated rural areas, dilapidated industries, and the Communist Party using illegal force to destroy transportation and factories. Production is declining day by day, and people's livelihood is becoming more difficult. Clothing and food needs are provided by foreign countries, and the huge amount of imports exceeds exports, which is shocking. If we do not seek to save ourselves, how can we stand on our own? Therefore, workers and peasants must redouble their hard work, work hard, increase production, and enrich national strength. In particular, labor and capital must cooperate to eliminate suspicion. Factory closures and strikes are not allowed. Following this path, the economic crisis can still be overcome, and the cause of national construction can be achieved. This is three.</p>
<p>In short, the country is now at a critical juncture of survival. Turning danger into safety depends on our awareness and efforts at this time. Thinking back to when I, Zhongzheng, initiated the New Life Movement in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, external Japanese invaders and internal bandits were rampant, and the general public had almost completely lost confidence. I saw this crisis and urgently sought to save it. More than ten years have passed, and the unprecedented foreign insults have finally been eliminated. The only problems today are the failure to restore peace and order and the economic life showing instability. However, things are done by people. Reviving the decline and revitalizing depends on the transformation of the minds of our people. Therefore, I sincerely advise you to resolve to act decisively, fathers and brothers to encourage each other, to form a style of honesty, diligence, and thrift, and to establish the foundation of national construction and self-reliance. The future of the country and the nation depends on it. February 18, 36th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek.</p>

<h3>Measures for Handling Gold Shops; Ministry of Finance to Announce and Implement Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The measures for handling gold shops and jewelry stores' finished gold jewelry will be announced and implemented soon. Gold shops in Beijing did not open for business on the 18th. The industry held a meeting to discuss various issues related to future business operations.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] Gold shops in Beijing continued to close on the 18th. According to reports, there are a total of 72 gold shops in the city, employing more than 1,000 people. They held a meeting to discuss. According to the person in charge of the guild, in order to understand the country's difficulties, they should follow the order and wait for the handling of the new measures. However, they urgently hope that it will be announced as soon as possible, and at the same time, the unemployment problem of more than 1,000 people can be solved.

<h3>Deposits of Overseas Chinese in the United States Still Difficult to Transfer to Our Side</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th dispatch] Wall Street figures welcomed Chairman Chiang's emergency economic measures, calling them a "correct step" to stabilize China's economy. They believe that the Chinese government's new exchange rate (i.e., 11,000 legal tender equals one U.S. dollar) can be maintained. They also praised Chairman Chiang's decision to abolish government restrictions on private industry. When asked if American banks could assist the Chinese government in transferring Chinese private deposits in the United States to Chinese banks, the reply was that this method violates the principle of strict restrictions on transactions between banks and customers, so it is impossible to implement.</p>
<h3>The Markets in Various Places Are Calm</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Gold Shops Stopped Trading Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The reporter recently visited Wang Yizhai, Chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, and asked him to talk about the reaction and impact of the Beijing business community after the announcement of the economic emergency plan. He said that the ban on the buying and selling of U.S. dollars and gold had little impact on the Beijing market, because the economic strength of the Beijing market is weak, and it has never made large-scale purchases of this kind. Therefore, the general business situation will not be greatly affected. He welcomed the method of rationing essential living goods, because if the government can control essential materials, then the prices of various goods will not rise arbitrarily. Even if U.S. dollars and gold are traded openly, they will be decoupled from daily necessities and will not have any impact. Wang concluded that the business situation in Beijing will not be adversely affected by the new measures.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 18th dispatch] Prices in Suzhou today generally trended downwards. The highest price for medium-grade white rice was 98,000 yuan, but all gold and silver businesses in the county were closed.

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 18th dispatch] More than 100 gold and silver shops here stopped trading completely on the 18th, waiting for the government's handling measures.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th dispatch] The Central Bank has received a telegram from the head office stating that the exchange price for U.S. dollars is set at 11,640 yuan.

<h3>Gold Stocks Increase in Hong Kong; Prices Fall for Several Days</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th dispatch] The Hong Kong industrial, commercial, and financial sectors attach great importance to the announcement of the economic measures plan. Because the buying and selling of gold and foreign currencies are prohibited in the country, Hong Kong gold has lost its largest market, so the prices of gold and U.S. dollars have fallen for several days. The current gold reserves in Hong Kong have reached 200,000 ounces. Another 200,000 ounces of gold have been ordered and are being shipped in one after another. At the same time, gold from the mainland may also flow back to Hong Kong. It is expected that gold prices will continue to trend downwards. There are very few people buying gold in the financial market.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Koo Visits U.S. Secretary of State, Makes Five Appeals for Aid to China, $500 Million Loan Also Discussed</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] Dr. V.K. Wellington Koo, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, met with Secretary of State Marshall today for an hour, discussing matters of mutual interest to China and the United States. Also present was Mr. Walton Butterworth, Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs. When asked if China's financial crisis caused by hyperinflation of the legal tender was one of the issues discussed, the Ambassador said, "This is of course a matter of concern to both countries." He said that China's financial and economic situation has always been a matter of concern to the United States, and China is grateful for the United States' assistance in this regard. The Ambassador said that the United States can help China solve its economic crisis and explore various possibilities for assistance. He said that they did not discuss the use of the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank to China, and he would refer further questions on this matter to the Secretary of State. Dr. Koo said that they discussed the general situation of China's economy and industry, and how to improve it. Regarding the issue of war reparations from Japan, the Ambassador said that he hoped that the payment of such reparations and the transfer of electrical, textile, and other machinery to China would begin soon. When this machinery will begin to be transferred to China will be determined by the reparations organization under the direction of General MacArthur in Tokyo.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Authoritative sources say that the U.S. State Department is now considering strengthening President Chiang's austerity economic measures with a "gesture of spiritual support" to save China's collapsing economy. They doubt whether the United States will provide any material economic assistance to China, but expect some action to show U.S. sympathy for the situation. Regarding this matter, it is reported that Wellington Koo made five appeals for U.S. assistance to China's current situation during a lengthy meeting with Marshall.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Marshall met with Chinese Ambassador V.K. Wellington Koo for an hour today to discuss the issue of assisting China in resolving its economic crisis. Ambassador Koo told reporters afterwards that the discussion concerned matters of mutual interest to both countries, and that the issue of the $500 million U.S. loan to China was also discussed. The United States needs a satisfactory solution to China's political and economic stability as a prerequisite for the Export-Import Bank to extend the loan. At the same time, according to senior government officials, China has not yet asked the United States to freeze the deposits of Chinese people in the United States so that the National Government can control all foreign exchange held by Chinese people abroad. The initial reaction of the U.S. side to China's economic emergency measures can be described as attentive observation without comment. Trade experts at the State Department say they are awaiting an official report of President Chiang's important statement and are unable to comment at this time. The American press is paying close attention to these measures by the Chinese government. Officials in charge of Far Eastern trade at the Department of Commerce held a meeting on Monday, but the content has not been announced. Officials at the Chinese Embassy are also remaining silent about the situation in China, only saying that President Chiang's statement is a major decision. The U.S. government is unwilling to express any position on what it considers to be purely within the scope of China's internal affairs, implying that it intends to exert its influence on these internal affairs, even in the future. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not received a report on the development of the situation in China, but has reiterated that American businesses have high hopes for trade with China.</p>
<h3>Intensifying the Ban on the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Materials</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The battle in the Xushui area of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has now come to an end. Following the first battle at Caohe in Xushui, starting at 6:00 PM on the 16th, the Communist troops, with six brigades, launched a fierce attack on Yaocun Town, west of Xushui. The defending troops resisted with five regiments. By the night of the 17th, the Communist troops had increased to four columns, totaling 25 regiments, and launched ten fierce attacks on Yaocun. They broke through once, but were stopped by the defending troops each time. National Army reinforcements arrived yesterday and launched a counter-encirclement against the Communist troops. After a night of fierce fighting, the Communist troops were finally defeated at 5:00 AM this morning and dispersed towards Mancheng. The Communist troops' "one point, two sides" strategy is on the verge of final collapse, and the remaining "point" of Mancheng can be resolved in a day or two. Chen Jicheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Area, who commanded this battle, told reporters today that after two battles, the main force of the Communist troops has been largely defeated, and the threat to the northern section of the Pinghan Railway can be said to be lifted. The remaining 30,000 Communist troops in the eastern Hebei area can be eliminated within three months. The defense forces in Beiping are sufficient, and in the future, in addition to eliminating the surrounding areas, we will also jointly strengthen the orderliness of the city.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 18th] The National Army is tightening the encirclement of the Communist troops in Mancheng from three directions. The two armies are engaged in fierce fighting near Qicun. The suburbs of Mancheng are under the control of the National Army from three sides, and the main force of the Communist troops is in retreat.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The outskirts of Beiping are still not peaceful. The Communist troops have gathered several groups again, disturbing the southeast and west sides. Weishanzhuang Station (on the Pingjin Line), south of Beiping, was besieged by 2,000 Communist troops last night and engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops, retreating at 4:00 AM this morning. Yangxiudian, east of Beiping, was also attacked by Communist troops of unknown designation last night, and the stronghold was burned. Dongshankou, near the Greater and Lesser Tangshan Mountains west of Beiping, was also attacked once last night. The threat to the Mentougou district has not been lifted.</p>

<h3>Minister Bai Arrives in Shanghai from Nantong, Inspects Naval Institutions Today, Wang Maogong Arrives Together and Returns to Town That Evening</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Minister of National Defense and Director of the Pacification Zone Supervision Group Bai Chongxi arrived in Shanghai from Nantong at 3:30 PM yesterday aboard the "Minquan" warship. Those who came with him included Zheng Zhenyu, Director of the Land Administration Department, Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, and Lei Gu, Director of the First Group of the Pacification Zone Supervision Group, and more than forty other people. It is reported that Mr. Bai will stay in Shanghai for several days. He is scheduled to inspect the naval base, the Naval Academy, and the Jiangnan Shipyard and other institutions this morning (the 19th), and go to the Central Training Corps for inspection in the afternoon. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 21st by special military plane. However, according to naval sources, Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, will come to Shanghai from Taiwan on the 22nd. Mr. Bai may wait in Shanghai to meet with Mr. Gui before returning to Nanjing on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Director Bai led 21 staff members to Zhenjiang on the 13th of this month, where he met with 20 members of the First Group of the Supervision Group and went to the northern Jiangsu Pacification Zone for inspection. After visiting Nantong, Rugao, Haimen and other counties, he carefully investigated the administrative situation of the Pacification Zones, and convened several meetings to listen to opinions from local people. The impressions he gained were very profound. Whether the administrative guidelines of the Pacification Zone are in line with the actual situation, the Central Government will make certain modifications based on Mr. Bai's report, so as to enable the people in the recovered areas to quickly stabilize their lives.</p>
<p>All members of the First Group of the Supervision Group departed from Nanjing on the first of this month, and after arriving in Yangzhou, they were divided into three subgroups to inspect Taixian, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Shiying, Xinghua, Jiancheng, Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui and other places. The materials collected were very rich, and the devastation in the newly recovered areas made the members feel very emotional. The reporter yesterday interviewed various members who arrived in Shanghai. Their conclusion is that the land problem in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu is the most serious. The land disposal methods in the administrative guidelines of the Pacification Zone are quite difficult to implement. Secondly, the problems of local financial support, the unsoundness of administrative personnel at all levels, etc., make it impossible to implement good governance, and various malpractices are bound to arise. It is reported that the group will return to Nanjing in the coming days and submit specific recommendations to the government. After a short rest, they will go to the Lu-Yu Pacification Zone to continue supervision.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman of Jiangsu Province Wang Maogong arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and paid a visit to President Song that evening to report on the inspection. He then took the 11:00 PM night train back to Zhenjiang. According to Mr. Wang before leaving, the policy of stabilizing prices in the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line will be strictly enforced in the future.</p>

<h3>Our Strong Note to the Philippines, Criticizing the Philippines for Harming the Interests of Overseas Chinese, Negotiations Difficult to Continue Under Current Circumstances</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] Our Minister to the Philippines Chen Zhiping, in accordance with the instructions of the government, submitted a strongly worded note to Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino at 10:30 this morning, stating that under the current circumstances, the Chinese government has no choice but to temporarily suspend negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship. The note stated that it is currently difficult for the Chinese government to reach an agreement with the Philippine government on the various clauses of the treaty, because the Philippine negotiators have repeatedly changed the clauses they proposed, and have repeatedly withdrawn clauses that had previously been agreed upon jointly with the Chinese negotiators. The note criticized the Philippine government for even taking various measures to harm the interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines during the negotiations. Such measures are completely inconsistent with the Philippine government's repeated expression of its desire to promote Sino-Philippine relations. However, the Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Philippine government can take various steps to eliminate various obstacles that may harm genuine Sino-Philippine friendship. Under the current circumstances, the Chinese government has no choice but to temporarily suspend negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship.</p>

Under the guidance of Director Deng at the Executive Headquarters, he will be responsible for implementation and will definitely have a firm grasp.</p>
<p>Sufficient Local Finances</p>
<p>(3) Regarding financial issues, the income and expenditure of the provincial government are unbalanced and can still be subsidized by the central government. If the income and expenditure of the county and local governments cannot be self-sufficient and they hope for central government subsidies, it will be very difficult. It has now been decided to increase the powers of the administrative inspectors of various regions, ordering them to supervise and guide the counties under their jurisdiction, to effectively organize local finances, and strive to balance the budget and enrich local expenditures to stabilize the lives of public school staff. (4) Now is the preparation period for the implementation of constitutional government. Regarding the completion of local autonomy and all matters that should be promoted, we have discussed with all parties in the Party and government a method of cooperating and working together to jointly promote them. In the exercise of the people's political power, we must establish a foundation for promoting constitutional government based on the principle of universal justice.</p>
<p>Regarding the Xikang Incident</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the Xikang incident, the results obtained through investigation and investigation by all parties are mainly due to the strict enforcement of opium eradication last year. Cheng Zhiwu, Li Yuanheng and others who initiated the rebellion are all long-term bandits. They used this opportunity to call upon each other and take the opportunity to cause chaos. In the Pacification Conference convened in Chengdu this time, it was decided to distinguish between good and bad. The Sichuan-Kang Pacification Office will be responsible for supervising and urging the elimination of bandits. For the people who were coerced by the bandits and the counties affected by the bandits, Kang Provincial Chairman Liu Wenhui will be responsible for comforting them. All post-disaster relief matters will be handled by the Kang Provincial Government. Chairman Liu has been in charge of Xikang for many years. Due to this unfortunate incident, after this stimulation, he feels that there are still many provinces that need to be determined politically. He has decided to convene the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Xikang Provincial Assembly, the Speakers of the Ya'an County Assemblies, representatives of the Xikang people in Rong, and responsible Party and government personnel on March 1 to hold a political review meeting to seek innovation. The Executive Headquarters believes after investigation that it is necessary to effectively rectify the military affairs in Kang Province. We should earnestly rectify in accordance with the central government's military reorganization plan in order to achieve the purpose of protecting the people and ensuring security. The handling of Kang affairs is nothing more than [suppressing bandits, pacifying the people, revitalizing politics, and rectifying the army]. If we work hard in these areas, we will be able to live up to the government's expectations and the hopes of the people of Kang.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Spiritual and Moral Strength - Reflections on the 13th Anniversary of the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>After eight years of the long War of Resistance and more than a year since victory, the crises facing China appear to be deepening. After a long night, after welcoming the dawn of victory, it seems that the haze is gathering again, entering another long night. It seems a bit like the Arctic winter, always living in a long night. It is no wonder that people in this situation are prone to depression and despair. However, even the Arctic winter has long summer months, full of Arctic sunshine. The current situation in China may inevitably make people depressed and sad; but we cannot despair because of this. Even if we enter another long night; but where there is night, there must be dawn. We are all keenly aware of the current crisis. We must overcome these crises to welcome the coming of light. Human beings live and continue in hope; in today's difficult times, we should hold firm to the new hope for the construction of a new China. Where can this new hope come from? A simple answer is: we must enhance our spiritual and moral strength. Starting from this source to rectify our lives and implement our new life, we will have a new hope for everything around us. It is in this sense that after the government announced emergency economic measures, we commemorate the thirteenth anniversary of the New Life Movement, which is particularly touching and meaningful.</p>
<p>The root cause of all the maladies in China today lies in the human heart. The chaos in the economic sector, the political turmoil, and the low administrative efficiency, a major factor in this is the badness of the human heart. Because the human heart is bad, no matter how good the policies of the government are, the results of implementation are often far from the expected goals. Therefore, all the government's policies will be in vain if they do not start with the reform of the human heart. Regarding the current economic crisis, we have argued that political measures are no less important than economic measures, and in a sense, politics is more important than economics. However, if political measures do not begin with the reform of the human heart as a prerequisite, then all good and beautiful policies will be implemented in a way that is contrary to the expected purpose. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Spiritual strength is more important than material things, and revolution must first reform the heart." From today onwards, we should vigorously implement the reform of the heart; and the reform of the heart must start from me. I must first reform my life and behavior, vigorously implement the New Life Movement, and then can I use my new life and behavior to express my "reform of the heart." "Heart" and "action" are two in one, and only through the innovation of a person's behavior can we ultimately know the innovation of his heart.</p>
<p>On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement, our Chairman, despite being burdened with numerous affairs, still broadcasted to the nation, mentioning the importance of reforming the people. "The policies of politicians in our country in the past dynasties also took changing customs as the first task, because the foundation of the country lies in society. If society cannot establish good customs, and the people cannot be accustomed to modern life, then the country can never be modernized. However, since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the remaining poison of the enemy and puppets has not been eradicated, and the order of the country has not been stabilized; as a result, the atmosphere has become decadent, the spirit has become depressed, the human heart has become weak, and society has become degenerate. Those who speculate and seek advantages think they are capable; those who indulge in depravity are shameless. Rituals, righteousness, humility, and shame have been swept away." Our Chairman has fully explained the maladies of the current society. Examining why the people's lives are so corrupt, the main factor lies in the disappointment with real life, from disappointment to despair, from despair to corruption. Therefore, at present, we must turn despair into hope, holding a firm new hope; but we also hope that the government can rectify discipline and make the world able to distinguish between right and wrong. If the government's policies have a distinction between right and wrong, then discipline will not be lost, and the human heart can also be maintained. "Reform of the heart" is a kind of behavior, and the reason why there is such a behavior depends on two factors: external and internal. In terms of internal factors, we can have subjective reform of the heart, but if there are no external factors, then subjective reform of the heart, except for those who are naturally blessed, seems not easy to achieve. Therefore, in order to make everyone have the automatic reform of the heart, we must pay attention to the external factors. This is that we must have all kinds of environmental factors that enable people to reform their hearts, we must have all kinds of external signs that lead people to have the possibility of reforming their hearts, and then can we hope that people can have "reform of the heart."</p>
<p>But the heart is originally subjective; and the reform of the heart is especially a subjective behavior. In today's world, if we feel that all the symptoms are entirely due to the soil of the human heart, then we must first innovate or reform the heart. We cannot rely on external factors, but must first seek self-reform and self-innovation from spontaneous internal factors. The result of this self-innovation is the practice of a self-new life. We cannot give up the practice of the New Life Movement because others do not practice the New Life Movement; if everyone does this, the New Life Movement will never be possible to practice. We must start from ourselves, start from my practice. The essence of the New Life Movement is to incorporate rituals, righteousness, integrity, and shame into daily life. Rituals, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the inherent morality of our country. Some people suspect that the advocacy of the New Life Movement is a return to the past. What we want to point out here is that human life must have moral standards, and there is no distinction between new and old in moral standards. In a new era, we still want to maintain the old morality; because morality is neither new nor old. The interpretation of the virtue of morality may be different, but its value has never changed. The hope for China's future depends on the success of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>For the sake of China's future, the New Life Movement is only allowed to succeed, not allowed to fail. How to make it succeed lies in enhancing the spiritual and moral strength. This is reflected in the social aspect, and also reflected in the personal aspect. In short, the practice of the New Life Movement must start from ourselves.</p>

<h3>US-Soviet Relations Still Unclear; Marshall Plans to Meet Stalin Directly; US Protest Response Delivered to Moscow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Well-informed sources recently said that US Secretary of State Marshall has requested Stalin to meet with him alone during the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, so as to improve US-Soviet relations through personal contact.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the recent statement by US Under Secretary of State Acheson, criticizing the Soviet government for adopting a policy of "aggression and territorial expansion." The Soviet authorities have protested to the United States for this. According to responsible sources here, the content must be made public after it is delivered to Foreign Minister Molotov. This is the first diplomatic document issued by Marshall since he took office as Secretary of State. According to Acheson's previous announcement, the State Department will issue a bulletin to explain the Soviet protest. However, it is reported that Marshall prefers to personally reply to the Soviet government, rather than issue a bulletin in Washington or order his subordinates to draft a reply. US-Soviet relations are still generally unclear, and the US Senate and House of Representatives will discuss them during the meeting of the two houses. At that time, Marshall will address the congressmen again. Marshall is currently preparing his response to the inquiries to be submitted to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It is expected that some members of Congress will propose a "give and take" policy toward the Soviet Union. It is heard that Marshall will provide assurances to the congressmen that the State Department is giving special consideration to US-Soviet relations and the Soviet newspapers' attacks on the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the Soviet Union's protest against US Under Secretary of State Acheson's criticism of the Soviet Union for adopting a policy of territorial expansion, according to people close to Acheson, Acheson only used the term "expansion of power" when he made a statement on Soviet policy to Congress, and did not use the term "territorial expansion."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] US Secretary of State Marshall is finding it difficult to find a Republican to serve as an advisor to accompany him to Moscow to participate in the meeting. Republican giant Vandenberg has stated that he will not go to Moscow, and other figures such as Dulles are not enough to represent the entire Republican congressional delegation. Marshall is also unwilling to choose arbitrarily, lest he interfere in party politics.</p>
<h3>Revision of the Alliance Treaty; Britain and the Soviet Union Begin Negotiations; Anglo-French Alliance Aims to Prevent German Aggression</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] Well-informed sources recently said that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson has begun talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to discuss the revision of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. Stalin has written to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, advocating the revision of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Reliable sources say: The French government's draft of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty suggests that the alliance should last for twenty years, with the intention of preventing German aggression. The French draft treaty is very similar to the French-Soviet Alliance Treaty in terms of wording and meaning, stipulating that neither contracting party shall participate in any alliance system that opposes the other party. The main difference is that the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty incorporates the alliance relationship into the scope of the United Nations organization. In addition, it also stipulates economic cooperation between the two countries. Responsible parties in Paris believe that the effectiveness of the alliance will depend on the situation after the alliance is concluded. If the cooperation between the British and French industrial plans and policies towards Germany can be implemented one by one after the conclusion of the alliance, the effect of the alliance will be more important.</p>
<h3>US State Department; Streamlining Personnel</h3>
<p>Two Hundred People Have Resigned</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesman said that since the State Department began investigating people suspected of having "unclear backgrounds," only two people have been found to have reasons to be dismissed. About two hundred people have left the department voluntarily for various reasons, and some personnel resigned immediately after being questioned.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The US Department of Commerce today released a 57-page report accusing 400 Communist Party members who have infiltrated government agencies and occupied important positions of being loyal only to the Soviet Union and using their government positions to benefit foreign countries. The report urges Congress to thoroughly investigate the infiltration of the Communist Party into the State Department, the Department of Commerce, and other agencies.</p>
<h3>US and Canada Exchange Military Officers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 18th] Defense Minister Claxton said today that the United States and Canada are engaging in the first exchange of military personnel in peacetime. Twelve US Army officers will come to Canadian Army Headquarters in Ottawa, and Canada will also send fourteen Army officers to US Army Headquarters in Washington.</p>
<h3>US Presidential Term; Limited to Two Terms</h3>
<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Passes</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Senate Judiciary Committee recently passed a bill by a vote of nine to one, limiting the US presidential term to no more than eight years. The limitation bill had already been passed by the House of Representatives. The Judiciary Committee also passed an amendment, that is, if the president serves less than one year in one term, he can be re-elected for two terms. Both of the above restrictions are sufficient to limit President Truman to only one term after 1949.</p>
<h3>Dutch Princess Gives Birth to a Daughter</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 18th] Dutch Princess Juliana gave birth to another daughter last night. This is the fourth daughter of the princess and Prince Bernhard. If the princess does not produce a boy in the future, the Netherlands will be ruled by women for three generations.</p>
<h3>Voice of America; Begins Broadcasting to the Soviet Union; Aims to Promote Understanding Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Voice of America, the shortwave radio station of the US State Department, began broadcasting to the people of the Soviet Union in Russian today. It is heard that when Moscow listened, it was greatly disturbed and mixed with the sounds of European radio stations. The first broadcast in the United States had a discussion of 2,000 words on "National Rights" and a report on world news, interspersed with several records. According to the United Press correspondent in Moscow, the United States' attempt to use radio as a tool to cross the Soviet Union's "Iron Curtain" has attracted the attention of the Soviet Union. The US broadcast, in addition to being hindered by the atmosphere, was also blocked by French and Soviet radio stations. The correspondent mentioned three impressions of the Soviet people on the program as follows: (1) Too arrogant; (2) The reporter is too amateurish; (3) Generally interesting. The broadcast introduction quoted Secretary of State Marshall as saying that the United States will "try to provide the people of the world with pure facts."</p>
<h3>US Secretary of the Interior Departs for Japan; Related to the Trusteeship of Former Japanese Islands; US Proposes Draft Agreement Due to Domestic Political Reasons</h3>
<p>[United Press, Long Beach, California, 18th] Secretary of the Interior Krug is scheduled to fly to Japan this morning to meet with MacArthur to collect information for the United States' possible administration of the former Japanese islands in the Pacific. Krug will stop briefly in Honolulu on his way west, but said he will stay in Hawaii longer on his return trip to obtain information on the possibility of the Hawaiian Islands becoming a US state.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 17th] The United States today submitted to the United Nations a trusteeship plan for the former Japanese islands in the Pacific, which, in addition to specifying defense details, also contains provisions on the economic, social, and political life of the local residents, and suggests that the administration of all 650 islands be regarded as an integral part of the US administration.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] According to people close to the US delegation, the reason why the United States submitted to the United Nations a draft trusteeship for the former Japanese mandated islands was due to domestic political reasons. The US draft has aroused formal protests from the British, Soviet, and Australian governments, and the US's decision to submit it regardless of everything has also aroused criticism from most delegations. US officials pointed out that the State Department strongly supports this draft agreement, while the US military advocates immediately merging the islands. Supporters of the draft agreement believe that the United States can only do this to avoid accusations of imperialism and show obedience to the UN Charter. People outside the United States believe that it is doubtful whether the Security Council has the right to terminate Japan's mandate and grant the trusteeship to the United States. US officials stressed that this kind of opposition is being fully considered, so the US government is only asking for this issue to be included in the Security Council's peace negotiations and does not insist on immediate discussion.</p>
<h3>US Should Aid Democratic Countries</h3>
<p>Congressman Judd Advocates</p>
<p>[United Press, Huntington, West Virginia, 18th] Republican Congressman Judd said in a speech at Marshall University here today that the United States "should clearly explain to all parties that we will assist the democratic countries in Europe," but "we will not assist these countries in their imperial policies in Asia." Britain, France, and the Netherlands are the main protagonists in promoting colonialism in the post-war era. If most of Asia is forced to return to the old colonial form, then "Asia will explode, and the impact on the United States will be the same as the impact on Britain, France, and the Netherlands." "The military part of World War II has ended, and the war of ideas and politics that shakes the world is now underway to determine who truly wins the victory in this military war. Any country whose ideas can control the revival of Europe and the development of Asia's huge human resources and potential markets is the one that ultimately defeats Germany and Japan. This struggle is particularly fierce in the following three key areas: (1) Germany—its outcome will determine the fate of Europe... (2) China—its direction will guide the direction of Asia... (3) The United States—its direction will guide the direction of the Western Hemisphere. The struggle of ideas that will determine our future domestic and foreign policies has a great, perhaps even decisive, influence on determining the path that Germany and China will follow." Congressman Judd once served as a medical missionary in China and has repeatedly given speeches advocating unconditional recognition, assistance, and concessions to the National Government of China by the United States.</p>

<h3>Japan to Immediately Restore Private Foreign Trade: MacArthur's Headquarters Trade Management Office Announces</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Mr. Bickel, Deputy Director of the Trade Management Office at MacArthur's Headquarters, announced today: Limited private trade between foreign and Japanese merchants will be restored in the near future. The exact date cannot yet be specified, but it is expected to be implemented this summer. Headquarters will allow a small number of merchants to come to Japan to purchase certain designated goods. All private trade will require export permits issued by the Japanese government, and this system will be approved by MacArthur's Headquarters.

Most countries in the Far Eastern Commission currently have liaison missions stationed in Japan to discuss trade issues with Headquarters. This private trade will not be denominated in Japanese Yen. Headquarters may set prices, and merchants can pay Headquarters using letters of credit.</p>
<p>British Merchants to Also Restore Old Relationships with Japan</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] A Foreign Office spokesman announced today: The British request to restore trade with Japan has been met with a satisfactory response from the U.S. State Department. British merchants will be able to send representatives to Japan to restore old relationships and develop import and export trade. This will benefit Britain and accelerate Japan's economic recovery. However, as of yet, MacArthur's Headquarters has not made any statement. Headquarters has historically prohibited the entry of all Allied merchants due to the lack of food and housing. Even American commerce has been managed by government-run trading companies since the victory. These companies represent the government in controlling Japan's import and export trade. Almost all of Japan's imports are supplied by the United States, and the United States purchases approximately 65% of Japan's exports. The remainder of the exports are shipped to Korea, China, and the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>U.S. Compensation Committee Drafts New Compensation Plan for Japan: Aims to Make Japan Self-Sufficient; Fundamentally Different from Pauley Plan</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 18th] The five members of the American Compensation Committee, Mr. Streicher (Manager of Macklowe Corporation), Mr. Macklear, Mr. Burgess, Colonel Tissedaen, and Major Klaus, who came to Japan on January 28th to inspect Japanese factories and production equipment, spoke to reporters today through Mr. Streicher, representing the five: All five members came to Japan from a technical standpoint to study the Japanese compensation issue. The scope of this inspection included industrial equipment, private property, factories designated for compensation (including those still operating and those that have ceased operations), and factories not designated. The results of the investigation have been reported to MacArthur's Headquarters and will be submitted to the Department of the Army after returning to the United States. It is currently not necessary to publish the contents of the report in detail, but the report can be considered the best report based on the current situation. Mr. Streicher then answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) The Japanese believe that Commissioner Pauley's plan will have a devastating impact on Japan. What does the Compensation Committee think? (Answer) The basis of our investigation is to allow Japan to retain industries sufficient for self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>(Question) Considering the previous compensation plans made by the Allies, which are being re-examined, how will the Compensation Committee designate factories for compensation? (Answer) We are not involved in designating factories. Our mission is to submit a report to the U.S. Department of the Army, which stipulates Japan's industrial level, and not to re-designate factories. The main point of our plan is to enable Japan, composed of the four major islands, to be self-sufficient and to export in order to import.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the extent of the damage to the factories designated for compensation? (Answer) It varies from factory to factory.</p>
<p>(Question) Where is Japan's industrial level placed? (Answer) We do not trace back to 1894 (Sino-Japanese War) or 1914 (World War I). On the one hand, 1930 should be taken into consideration, and the situation in 1950 should also be considered.</p>
<p>(Question) Is the report made by the Compensation Committee this time fundamentally different from Commissioner Pauley's plan? (Answer) It is fundamentally different. However, whether our plan is more lenient than Pauley's plan should be judged by each individual.</p>
<p>(Question) If the self-sufficient economy of Japan in 1950 is determined, where will the Japanese standard of living be placed? (Answer) It must be based on history and data. What was the level of life for the Japanese in the mid-1930s should also be considered.</p>
<p>(Question) How long will it take to dismantle the compensation equipment? (Answer) Unknown.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the Department of the Army believe that the compensation equipment needs to be re-investigated? (Answer) Unknown. However, it is a fact that the U.S. Department of the Army gathered technicians on December 25th last year and put forward a suggestion.</p>
<p>(Question) Can the views of the U.S. Department of the Army be interpreted as a change of direction? (Answer) It is felt that it is necessary to observe from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>(Question) Has consideration been given to conducting a survey of Japanese compensation equipment? (Answer) How the compensation equipment is distributed should be decided by the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>(Question) Some believe that dismantling the compensation equipment and reinstalling it to start production will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, it would be better to leave it in Japan and take its products. What does the Compensation Committee think? (Answer) This point has been studied, but it is not suitable to write in the report.</p>
<p>(Question) Will the textile equipment be dismantled? (Answer) There is no need to reduce Japan's textile production capacity.</p>
<p>(Question) After inspecting various parts of Japan, do you think the compensation equipment is not very useful? (Answer) This shows that the press corps is very clever.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Responsible for Inspecting Banks and Firms: 5 Billion Overdraft Can Be Restored; Rumor of Confiscating Gold in Vaults is False: Vice Minister of Finance Received Financial Sector Yesterday to Dissipate Doubts</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan and Director of the Currency Department Dai Mingli hosted representatives from both the banking and money industries in the conference room of the Joint Administration Office. Chairman Xu Boyuan first gave a speech, stating that the Ministry of Finance's thorough investigation of banks and firms is intended to protect the reputation of legitimate banking and money businesses and to thoroughly implement future government orders. In order, the operations of national banks and provincial and municipal public banks will be examined first. The inspection work will avoid hindering the daily operations of each bank and firm, and it is hoped that the heads of each bank and firm will assist.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Both Industries Frankly Expressed Opinions</h3>
<p>After the speech, Mr. Xu asked those present to express their opinions as much as possible. At that time, the speakers from the banking and money industries included Qin Runqing, Li Renzai, Xu Guomao, Wang Yansong, and Cheng Junguan, who all made frank statements about the pain suffered by the banking and money industries and their hopes for the Ministry of Finance. Summarizing the various opinions, they were nothing more than the following points: (1) Please ask the government to investigate the responsibility for the gold rush and whether the speculators are mostly merchants or non-merchants. If there are speculators in the banking and money industries, which group and which family they belong to, please ask the government to investigate and announce. (2) In the past, the Joint Reserve Board and the Central Bank had a contract allowing for an overdraft of 5 billion yuan. After the gold rush occurred this time, the central government ordered a stop to the overdraft. This overdraft method was approved by the Ministry of Finance, and this sum of money is of a standby nature, guaranteeing that it will not be fully used. The amount of 5 billion is not large and does not affect the government's policies, but it is a major guarantee for each bank and firm. It is hoped that the government will allow the restoration of the overdraft. (3) It is hoped that this inspection will be of a positive nature. Apart from those related to the gold rush, do not be too trivial and harsh. Otherwise, it may drive floating capital out of the financial sector, which is even more harmful. At present, our country's production has entered a state of paralysis. It is hoped that the authorities will have an accurate estimate of the needs of the national production sector in order to provide appropriate assistance. Today's important plan is to seize materials and promote production. It seems appropriate to convene a meeting of the Shanghai production sector to determine the amount and prescribe the right medicine. The Central Bank's current practice of purchasing gold at low prices is not very appropriate. It is best to open up a legitimate outlet for gold, that is, to allow the exchange of gold for foreign exchange under superior conditions to purchase the necessary production tools. (4) At present, bank deposits are too small and are not proportional to the amount of floating capital. Therefore, the financial sector has no power to control market interest rates. It is hoped that the government can reduce the income tax on deposit interest to facilitate banks' absorption of deposits. At the same time, it is hoped that promissory notes do not require deposit preparation. (5) It is hoped that the listed interest rate can be increased. Because current prices are rising and the expenses of banks and firms are huge, there is no way to pay the expenses without raising the interest rate. In fact, the market interest rate has already exceeded the listed rate. (6) In the past, the regulations stipulated that only the court and the Ministry of Finance could check the books of banks and firms. Under the current emergency measures, can other agencies check them? Please answer clearly. (7) There is a rumor that if gold is found in the inspection of the vault, it can be confiscated. Please, Vice Minister, dispel the rumors on the spot. (8) In the new method of controlling finance, it is hoped that there will be a clear stipulation on the use of loans so that each bank and firm can follow it. (9) At present, there is a phenomenon of disconnection between the Central Bank and commercial banks. The Central Bank is only a "government bank, not a bank of banks." It has failed to do its best to regulate finance. When the money supply is loose and the price of gold rises, it does not sell gold and materials. On the contrary, it sells a large amount of cotton yarn when the money supply is tight today, which is really incomprehensible. (10) It is hoped that real estate can be used as collateral for loans in the future to open up an outlet for capital.</p>
<p>Hope to Establish Mutual Trust with the Government</p>
<p>The above opinions were answered separately by Mr. Xu and Mr. Dai. Dai Mingli stated on the spot that the Ministry of Finance has negotiated with relevant parties and that the Ministry of Finance will still be responsible for the inspection of banks and firms in the future. Xu Boyuan stated that the overdraft of 5 billion can still be handled according to the contract if there are no special circumstances. The inspection of the vault will be handled in accordance with the government's regulations, and there is no confiscation of gold upon discovery. Banks must have detailed records of loans to production businesses. This is a must for general banks. As for the current inspection, it naturally belongs to a positive nature. However, because this incident originated from the financial sector, the inspection also focuses on banks and firms. In the future, there will be positive measures in the economy. The Ministry of Finance will always assist legitimate commercial banks and has no intention of making things difficult. Assisting production is an important task in the financial sector in the future. It is regrettable that some of the production loans last year were indeed used to purchase gold. They will be dealt with severely after investigation in the future, and the banks and firms that handled them should also bear moral responsibility. It is hoped that the financial sector in Shanghai can establish mutual trust with the government in the future and cooperate with each other in action.</p>
<h3>Payment of Value Increase for Pre-War Deposits</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is Still Studying</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan: The Ministry of Finance is still studying the multiplier for the payment of the value increase for pre-war deposits, and a solution may be available soon. In the future, the determination of the multiplier will take into account the interests of both depositors and banks, and strive for fairness and rationality.</p>
<h3>Three-Person Committee to Investigate Bank and Firm Accounts</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan convened a meeting of members of the Economic Supervision Group and the persons in charge of each group at Commander Xuan's private residence the night before last to discuss cooperation methods and report on the mission assigned to them in Shanghai this time, which is to thoroughly investigate the details of the gold rush and pay special attention to illegal acceptance of gold mortgages and short-selling and speculative purchases by banks and firms. Those found to have factual evidence will be severely punished according to law. In order to accomplish the mission, it is hoped that the garrison department will cooperate and proceed together. A three-person committee was immediately decided to be established, consisting of Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, Chief Gao of the Joint Administration Office, and Xu Youzuo, Head of the Gold and Currency Group of the Economic Supervision Group, to direct the existing staff of the Gold and Currency Group and the officials assigned to Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance to be divided into seven units to continue checking the accounts of banks and firms throughout the city.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Economic Supervision Group continued its investigation and surveillance work yesterday, and the market situation improved. The Food Group also sent armed personnel to the suburbs of Caohejing, Zhoujiaqiao, Yangshupu, Nanshi, and Jiangwan to crack down on black market transactions. The market price of yarn and cloth also continued to fall sharply yesterday. The Gold and Currency Group's investigation of bank and firm accounts has yielded clues and may take action within days.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun Comes to Shanghai for Inspection: Wang Yunwu and Xiao Zheng Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Yu Hongjun came to Shanghai yesterday morning to listen to reports and make important decisions in order to inspect the financial dynamics in Shanghai. The main points are: (1) Instructing various banks and firms to enhance their business. (2) The business scope of the banks of various provinces and cities stationed in Shanghai should be within the approval of the Ministry of Finance. If there is any excess, they should stop business immediately. Mr. Yu also visited President Song at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning to discuss matters. He returned to Beijing that night. In addition, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Finance Minister Xiao Zheng have returned to Beijing by car last night.</p>
<h3>Four More People Arrested for Buying and Selling U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Fourth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Department arrested a suspect, Chen Zongqie, yesterday at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road for illegally selling U.S. dollars. In addition, the police station arrested three suspects, Sun Zhengfu, Yang Qichao, and Shan Xionghua, in the North Sichuan Road area for illegally selling gold and U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for Commodity Supply: Divided into Three Major Departments; Must Be Submitted to Chairman for Approval Before Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] After Xu Kan, Chief Accountant of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, gathered the persons in charge of various relevant agencies on the 17th to draft the detailed rules for the implementation of the method of supplying daily necessities, Mr. Xu, together with the persons in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Food, carried them to President Song for approval on the morning of the 18th. President Song stated that he would wait to submit them to Chairman Chiang for approval before announcing and implementing them. It is reported that the content of the implementation details is roughly divided into three major departments. The first is the distribution of supplies for public school teachers, the second is the distribution of supplies for industrial workers, and the third is the detailed rules for stabilizing prices. During implementation, the agencies requesting distribution will first compile a roster and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then issue purchase certificates. At the same time, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan will issue materials supply vouchers. The agencies supplying the materials will then concentrate the materials in various municipal governments. Public school teachers can purchase from the municipal government with purchase certificates and supply vouchers. The amount of supplies distributed will generally be based on four family members per public school teacher, and the amount distributed to staff members will be slightly more than that of workers.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Talks: Announcing Emergency Measures; No Different from Economic Martial Law; Implementing a Rationing System to Stabilize Prices; Hope Everyone Can Endure and Overcome This Difficult Time</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian has resumed his duties after taking leave. He told reporters yesterday: The economic emergency measures announced by the government this time are equivalent to declaring economic martial law. It is believed that the turmoil caused by the gold rush will gradually stabilize in the short term. After the turmoil passes and martial law is lifted, these emergency measures can be stopped. In the past, workers and merchants? mutually shirked responsibility. Workers claimed that wages increased due to high prices, and merchants claimed that prices were driven up due to increased wages affecting costs. This is the same as arguing which came first, the chicken or the egg. In fact, they are mutually causal. This time, the government will first stabilize wages, ordering that they should not exceed the cost of living index in January, and will try its best to reduce prices in the short term, so as to fully deal with the issue of negotiated prices and make the responsibilities clear. If the price of goods is still high, it will be clearly the responsibility of the merchants. This is an urgent remedy for the country's economic crisis. It is hoped that everyone can be patient, believing that this time will not be too long and will be able to stabilize in the short term.</p>
<p>Supply of Daily Necessities to Be Implemented from March</p>
<p>Regarding the rationing plan proposed by myself, the plan for cultural workers and private school teachers has been deleted, but the rest have been adopted by the central government as proposed. This method will be implemented first in Beijing and Shanghai, and then gradually promoted in other regions. The public school teachers' part in this city will be handled by a committee established by the municipal government, and the supply of daily necessities for workers will be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau assisting relevant agencies. The supply of these daily necessities cannot be procured for this month, so it will be implemented from March. Before implementation, it has been agreed with President Song to calculate this month's wages by converting the price difference between February and January into legal tender and issuing it. It has also been agreed with President Song that the fixed method may be rigid, and local customs and habits may be different, so it can be adapted to local conditions and individual circumstances and handled flexibly.</p>
<p>Director Wu also said: After this method is implemented, if the factory is still losing money, the government will not allow it to close down, so it should be audited and provided with relief if necessary.</p>
<p>People Buying Gold Jewelry Does Not Encourage Speculation</p>
<p>Wu believes that it is inappropriate to include jewelry in the measures to crack down on gold trading. He believes that people use their small monthly surplus to buy gold jewelry, which is a good form of disguised savings and invisibly helps the government to promote the policy of contracting currency. Otherwise, using it to buy goods will stimulate prices. Some people believe that last year's year-end bonuses for workers were mostly used to purchase gold jewelry, which is also one of the reasons for encouraging speculation. This is a blind statement. Those who encourage speculation are not small citizens who buy gold rings, but those who buy gold bars. Therefore, jewelry should be opened up. Otherwise, the outlet for gold will either be smuggling or waste. Therefore, he has discussed it with the Minister of Economic Affairs to formulate remedial measures as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the New Life Movement: Grand Event Today</h3>
<p>Park Open Free of Charge for One Day</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] Today is the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. The city's New Life Movement Promotion Association will hold a commemoration ceremony at the Great Light Theater this morning at 9:00 AM, and will hold New Life Movement evening parties at five locations, including Zhabei, Caojiadu, Yangshupu, Nanshi, and Jiangwan, starting at 6:00 PM tonight.

At the same time, Speaker Pan will broadcast "Practicing the New Life and Promoting National Integrity" on Asia Radio at 7:00 PM tonight.</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has also decided to open the park free of charge for one day today.</p>
<h3>Industries Unanimously Express Willingness to Assist Government Policy Decisions: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Holds Price Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a price conference yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Approximately 400 people attended, including Director Xiao Zheng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and directors and executive directors of various trade associations. After Chairman Xu Jiqing reported the purpose of the meeting, Director Xiao was invited to speak. He stated that the recent passage of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan by the National Defense Supreme Council was intended to save the current economic crisis. The government's passage of this plan aims to eliminate speculative markets, assist legitimate industry and commerce, and promote foreign trade to stabilize the overall economic situation. However, while increasing exchange rates to develop international trade, it is also necessary to consider the rising domestic prices and the difficulties of the people's livelihood. Therefore, effective methods must be adopted to suppress prices and bring them into a normal supply and demand relationship, rather than being swayed by fluctuations in foreign currency. This requires 80% of the effort from everyone present, in addition to the government's efforts. The government is well aware of the difficulties faced by industry and commerce, and is making every effort to stabilize wages. The cycle of wages and prices chasing each other will bring legitimate industries to the brink of bankruptcy. Therefore, it has been decided to fix wages and adopt a system of in-kind distribution. It is hoped that all industries and commerce will work together with the government to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Hope Industries Will Not Seek Petty Gains</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then spoke, stating four points: (1) After the ban on buying and selling gold banknotes, a black market may emerge. While the government is responsible for suppressing and punishing this, it is hoped that industry and commerce will not follow the gold banknote black market and raise prices. (2) To provide legitimate outlets for idle capital, the government has decided to auction off enemy and puppet materials, surplus materials, and state-owned production enterprises, or issue stocks. However, it is hoped that this will not lead to hoarding and speculation. It is hoped that trade associations will not only prohibit hoarding within their own industries, but also report hoarding by non-members. (3) Prices rose sharply with the rise in gold banknotes, but since the price of gold banknotes is now regulated, all prices should automatically decrease. (4) Price fluctuations in Shanghai often affect the entire country. It is hoped that industries will not seek temporary petty gains and throw the national economy into chaos.</p>
<p>Freezing Gold Ornaments Is Highly Inappropriate</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then spoke, outlining five main points: (1) It is hoped that various export goods, such as silk, tea, tung oil, and pig bristles, will not rise again and again due to the exchange rate change. Such unreasonable price increases are tantamount to suicide. (2) The government's recently passed Economic Emergency Measures Plan has been sarcastically called a "rehash of the extraordinary period." It must be understood that China is still in an extraordinary period, and the government's emergency measures are to save itself and relieve the people. (3) Whether the emergency measures are effective depends on the integrity of personnel. If personnel are not sound, the best measures can become the most dangerous. (4) The ban on the sale of gold ornaments, which has led to the closure of silver shops, is absolutely inappropriate. This measure will freeze the people's gold ornaments, depriving thrifty and accumulating civilians of part of their assets. This is tantamount to the government selling goods to the people and then declaring them invalid. (5) Regarding the arrest of individuals privately selling US dollars the other day, it should be verified whether they were openly trading. If they were arrested simply for carrying US dollars, then anyone could be arrested at any time.</p>
<p>Industry Representatives Express Several Hopes</p>
<p>After Pan's speech, Mayor Wu explained the ban on the sale of gold ornaments and the arrest of individuals privately selling US dollars. Representatives from various trade associations then expressed their opinions, unanimously stating their willingness to assist the government's policies. However, they hoped that the government would adopt the opinions of various industries and implement practical and effective measures for stabilizing wages, in-kind distribution, and supplying raw materials at reasonable prices. They also hoped that the government would handle the suppression of usury and the provision of production loans fairly. The discussion continued until 6:00 PM, when the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Shanghai to New York in 33 Hours: North Pacific Air Route to Open in May; US Trial Flight Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The second inspection aircraft of Northwest Airlines for the North Pacific route trial flight arrived at Jiangwan Airport in the city at noon yesterday, carrying 19 people including company directors, senior officials, meteorologists, civil aviation management personnel, and Mrs. Zhu Shiming, wife of the representative to Japan.

The entire route starts from New York, passing through Washington, Seattle, Anchorage, Alaska, Adak, St. Ya, the Aleutian Islands, Korea, Tokyo, Shanghai and ending in Manila. It only takes 33 hours from Shanghai to New York. Hunter believes that the opening of this fast route will greatly benefit Sino-American commerce and friendship. Northwest Airlines will also be in contact with Trans World Airlines in Shanghai to promote the Trans World route. If it can be realized, Shanghai will become one of the world's air transport hubs. The passenger fares for the North Pacific route have been drafted by the company and are awaiting approval from the US government. The one-way fare from Shanghai to New York is 793 US dollars, and the round-trip fare is 1,451.60 US dollars.

<h3>Employees of Service Organizations Cannot Avoid Military Service</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] According to the new military service regulations, all citizens have the obligation to serve when conscription resumes. In view of the fact that in the past, many conscripts in various counties have tried to become employees in local central government agencies to avoid military service after being selected, the authorities have reiterated the ban and stipulated that employees in all agencies, except for active-duty military officers and staff, or those who are regarded as active-duty by law, and national soldiers and reservists who have been trained and registered as veterans in their hometowns, if they are of conscription age and are selected, they must be sent back for conscription.</p>

<h3>Tragedy on Dongda Ming Road: Kerosene Stove Explosion Causes Disaster; Eleven Women and Children Dead or Injured; Kerosene Mixed with Gasoline Can Be Reported and Investigated in the Future</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] A fire broke out at 4:20 AM yesterday at No. 77, Fuqing Lane, No. 1027 Dongda Ming Road (East Broadway Road) in Hongkou. Eight people were buried in the fire, and three were injured after jumping from windows. Because the residents were still in deep sleep at the time, the fire had become uncontrollable by the time the police on duty discovered it. The fire department received the news and drove several pumper trucks to the scene to put out the fire. It took about two hours to extinguish the fire. In addition to burning down the house at that address, it also spread to the building at No. 79 next door. The lane is inhabited by poor families, most of whom have mezzanine floors, with many people sleeping in small rooms. It is reported that the fire started on the lower floor, immediately burning through the ladder, causing the tragedy. After the incident, it was learned that Mrs. Chen Lu, an old woman on the upper floor of No. 79, fell and was injured after jumping from the window. Cai Renbao injured his foot, and Xu Xiang was injured in the face. They were sent to the Lester Chinese Hospital. The bodies found by firefighters at the scene were burned beyond recognition and were a terrible sight. They were identified as Yu Yinmei (21 years old), Mrs. Wang Zhou (21 years old), girl Wang Meili (3 years old), boy Cai Bilian (4 years old), Mrs. Cai Li (23 years old), Chen Dongmei, Cai Xiaomei (newborn 29 days old), and a certain Jia, younger brother of Cai Li (newly arrived in Shanghai from the countryside), a total of eight people.</p>
<p>[Another report] Prosecutor Quan Tao of the District Procuratorate went to the fire scene yesterday morning to examine the bodies. The arsonist has fled in fear of punishment. According to nearby residents, the fire was caused by a kerosene stove, because the kerosene was mixed with gasoline, causing an explosion. Prosecutor Quan paid close attention to this point and stated that if citizens find that kerosene is mixed with gasoline in the future, they can directly report it to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Trial of Rickshaw Puller Stabbed with Knife Reopened: Victim's Injuries Not Yet Healed; Defendant Not Allowed Bail; Three Witnesses Interrogated, Trial Adjourned</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The case of the US sailor stabbing a rickshaw puller was retried yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, whose injuries had not yet healed, appeared in court with his brother Cheng Rongquan and a lawyer. According to Cheng's statement to the court, his brother's injuries had not fully recovered, and he had specifically asked him to withdraw the previous statement of withdrawal of charges that he had signed after being deceived. Judge Wu Shaochang first summoned witness Zhu Songhua. According to Zhu, he is a rickshaw puller who was waiting for business at the entrance of the Dongda Ming Road Seaside Bar on January 1 this year. He witnessed Rogers committing the crime and saw Cheng Rongfang initially supporting himself on a utility pole after being injured before falling to the ground. Another witness, Lewis, stated that he is an American and an employee of the General Fishery Management Office. He also went to the Seaside Bar that day. At about 10:00 PM, he went out with Rogers and waitress Wang Xiulan. As soon as they went out, many rickshaw pullers came forward to pester them. To avoid conflict, they retreated into the bar and rested for a quarter of an hour before going out again. The second time they went out, there were fewer people. He and Rogers walked towards the General Fishery Management Office stop on Zhaofeng Road. The rickshaw pullers surrounded them again. At that time, he and Rogers were six or nine feet apart, so he did not personally see how Rogers fought with the rickshaw puller, and he did not know the reason for the fight. Another witness, Paul Scott, stated that he is an instructor at the Fishery Management Office. He and Rogers went out together on New Year's Day. The second time they left the Seaside Bar, the rickshaw pullers first threw stones at them and then surrounded Rogers. Later, when Rogers broke out of the encirclement and came to the station, he saw that his forehead was injured. As for how Cheng Rongfang was injured, he said, "I did not see it."</p>
<p>After questioning the witnesses, the court interrogated the murderer Rogers again. According to his statement, the first time he went out, he was surrounded by many rickshaw pullers. One of them pestered the waitress who was traveling with him. The second time he went out, one of the people closest to him threw a two-foot-long rope tied with an iron ring at his head, causing him injury. To protect himself, he drew his knife as a warning, injuring Cheng Rongfang. As for whether he owed Cheng money for the rickshaw, Rogers claimed that he never thought of taking a rickshaw to return to Fuxing Island. Dongda Ming Road is about four miles from the Fuxing Island fishing boat mooring site. The Fishery Management Office has its own transportation vehicles, so he never took Cheng Rongfang's rickshaw at all. The court heard the defense lawyers Yao Yongli and Jidexun requesting the court to question Rogers on several points for reference. The court instructed that if there were any proposals, they could be submitted in writing for a ruling. They also requested permission to post bail, stating that both lawyers were willing to take full responsibility and would never allow the defendant to escape. They also said that in order to maintain Sino-American relations, they requested that he not be detained for too long, but this was rejected. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer submitted a supplementary statement, stating that the victim had been coerced into signing and requested that the previous statement be withdrawn and that legal aid be granted. After receiving the statement, the court adjourned the case for retrial and returned the defendant to custody.</p>

<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" revised and passed by the National Defense Commission stipulates that "the wages of employees calculated according to living expenses should take the living expenses of January this year as the highest index, and the basic salary must not be increased in any way."

Therefore, the General Labor Union put forward the following four suggestions: (1) The items to be rationed in the plan announced by the Central Government only include food, cloth, and fuel. At least three more items should be added: cooking oil, table salt, and sugar. (2) The rationed quantity should be sufficient for the needs of ordinary households, and the quality should be noted and should meet normal standards. (3) The items to be rationed according to the regulations of the Central Government are only limited to industrial workers; professional workers should also be rationed the same way. (4) The rationing should be jointly handled with various labor unions or cooperative societies run by the labor unions. It is reported that the General Labor Union will submit the above four suggestions to the Social Affairs Bureau today for submission to the municipal government.</p>

After learning of the report, the mayor believed that the Quan Gong Building incident had not yet been resolved, and in case the funeral caused new disputes, it would be detrimental to the city's security. Therefore, the mayor ordered the Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to step up their prevention, and summoned Mr. Liang's family, the Liang Case Funeral Committee, and the person in charge of the January 28th Incident Support Association to the Police Bureau for talks. Later, because they did not go to the Police Bureau, the mayor invited Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, and Zhang Bojun to the Municipal Government for talks in order to avoid the expansion of the situation. After the results of the mayor's inquiry, they all claimed that they did not know much about Mr. Liang Renda's funeral. Therefore, he immediately found Yang Ruijun, Jing Bennian, Ma Deyin and others, the persons in charge of the Funeral Committee, to come to the Municipal Government and told them that what the citizens of Shanghai need most today is stability, and everything must focus on security. The Quan Gong incident has not yet been resolved, and Mr. Liang's funeral should be given priority. They immediately expressed their agreement and were willing to postpone it voluntarily. The mayor also ordered them that when they prepare to hold the funeral in the future, they should first consult with the mayor.</p>

<h3>Female Traitor Han Youjie Takes Child to Court; Denies Luring Guerrilla Teams; Claims She Did Not Acquire Chinese Citizenship</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Han Youjie, female, originally Japanese named Nakashima Kamako, later obtained Chinese citizenship due to her marriage to Chinese man Han Jingtang. After the September 18th Incident, she served as an employee of the staff department of enemy commander Honjo Shigeru, and as the dean of the Puppet Fengtian Zenrin Women's High School.

<h3>National Taiwan University Welcomes Professors from the Mainland to Conduct Intensive Research</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th] National Taiwan University is currently the best research environment in the country.

Professors at the university (regardless of department) who wish to engage in research work can receive a research grant of NT$20,000 per month and can enjoy the use of research rooms and certain university facilities. The library has 500,000 books, especially English, Japanese, and German books. Reference books on East Asian history are almost fully available.

<h3>Change of President at Guiyang Teachers College; Students Express Rejection</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Guiyang Airmail] The issue of the change of president at the National Guiyang Teachers College has been ongoing for nearly two months without resolution. Since the Director of the Guizhou Department of Education, Chuan Qixue, returned to Guiyang from the capital at the end of last month, the new president of the college, Du Shuji, decided to go abroad to study education, stating that he would take over the position after returning to the country and that he would request the Ministry of Education to send someone to act as an agent for the college's affairs. The students of the college telegraphed the Ministry of Education requesting that they quickly dispatch a formal president who has the knowledge, morality, character, prestige, and ability to lead young people to head the college. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education suddenly appointed Zeng Jing, a professor in the Department of Education at the college, to act as Du's agent and take over the college's affairs. Upon hearing the news, the students of the college unanimously expressed their rejection and sent representatives to visit Zeng, who also expressed extreme surprise, saying that he had no prior knowledge of this and would never consider it. He was willing to resign voluntarily to the Ministry of Education and made several statements regarding the reasons for his resignation: (1) He had no interest in educational administration; (2) He did not know Du personally, and he was a colleague of President Qi for many years; (3) Not only would he not act as the president's agent, but he would also not be willing to be the formal president even if appointed. The students were satisfied and unanimously resolved the following: In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Education again to request the speedy dispatch of a formal president, they asked Professor Zeng Jing to fulfill his promise, resign voluntarily to the Ministry of Education, issue a statement in the newspaper, and solemnly declare to Director Fu that he should not cling to his prejudices, openly support Zeng, and secretly assist Du, causing further disturbances.</p>

<h3>Self-Funded Students Petitioned Yesterday, Requesting a Foreign Exchange Rate of 3350 from the Central Bank; President Bei Gladly Agreed to Meet and Respond This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Over 1,200 self-funded students who passed the Ministry of Education's examination last July are unable to go abroad due to the recent adjustment of the foreign exchange rate to 12,000 yuan. At 10:00 AM yesterday, over 60 self-funded students, including Zhao Yiwei and Ling Shuang, gathered at the Bund Park and went to the Central Bank to petition President Bei Zuyi, submitting a written petition explaining their reasons and requesting a foreign exchange rate of 3350, with a one-time exchange of US$2,900 (including one year of tuition of US$400, one year of living expenses of US$1,800, and travel expenses of US$700). Bei sent his secretary, Zhu Kunshou, to meet with them, stating that the Central Bank was an implementing agency and could not accept their request. The student representatives informed him that they had previously petitioned the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Executive Yuan last winter, and both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance had replied that the matter should be decided by the Central Bank, so they came specifically to visit President Bei and presented the Ministry of Education's instructions. Secretary Zhu then reported back to Bei and instructed the students to wait outside. They waited until after 11:00 AM but still did not see Bei appear, and the students became quite anxious and began to question him. Zhao Yiwei and Ling Ji entered the office and contacted Secretary Zhu, requesting that he quickly speak with Bei by telephone. The students then sent people out to buy dry food for lunch to show their intention of not leaving the Central Bank until they saw President Bei. Seeing this, the Central Bank staff invited Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department, to come forward and agree with President Bei on the phone: President Bei would personally meet with student representatives at 10:00 AM this morning (the 19th) to give a responsible and affirmative response. Lin also assured the students that he would be responsible for simplifying the procedures for self-funded students applying for foreign exchange as much as possible. After 12:00 PM, the students left. At that time, the students stated that over a hundred students would go to the Central Bank again this morning at 10:00 AM to meet with President Bei in person and await a responsible response. It is reported that Bei needs to submit the issue of the students' request for a foreign exchange rate of 3350 to President Song for a decision.</p>

<h3>The Contents of the National Standard Geography Textbook for Senior Elementary Schools Should Be Corrected; the Ministry of Education Orders the Municipal Education Bureau to Instruct All Elementary Schools to Take Note</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the Municipal Education Bureau stating: "The current national standard textbooks for elementary schools were compiled and published successively during the Anti-Japanese War years. Elementary schools in various provinces and cities have been using them for many years. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, domestic and international situations have changed, and the occupied territories have been recovered. Administrative regions have also been adjusted in many places. The curriculum and teaching materials of elementary schools should be re-revised separately to meet the actual situation and adapt to the needs. Regarding the elementary school curriculum standards, the Ministry has already drafted a revised draft, which will be promulgated and implemented after detailed review and completion. Regarding the national standard textbooks for elementary schools, the Ministry is supervising the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to revise them as soon as possible and carefully to achieve perfection. Except for the eight volumes of the elementary Chinese language and common knowledge textbooks that have been revised and re-printed, and all schools should uniformly use the revised standard editions, there are many contents in the geography textbook for senior elementary schools that should be revised. A correction table has been formulated, and each school should correct the text and illustrations in the textbook separately during teaching. For other textbooks, if the content differs from the current actual situation before the revised standard editions are published and supplied, corrections should also be made separately during teaching. In addition to issuing separate instructions, the Ministry is urgently sending the national standard geography textbook for senior elementary schools and instructing all affiliated elementary schools to take note of it."</p>

<h3>A Tour of Sichuan University, the Highest Institution of Learning in Southwest China</h3>
<p>By our correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Leaving the eastern suburbs of Chengdu and heading west along the Jin River, which flows "ten thousand miles with shimmering water," for about three miles, one arrives at the famous Wangjiang Tower, a historical site of Xue Tao. To the south of the Jin River Tower, a vast expanse of land is dotted with several magnificent palace-style buildings amidst red flowers and green trees. This is the National Sichuan University, the highest institution of learning in Southwest China.</p>
<p>Sichuan University—commonly referred to as Chuan Da—is considered the highest institution of learning in the Southwest and the most complete school of its kind. It not only encompasses five colleges (liberal arts, law, agriculture, science and engineering, and teacher's college) and twenty-three departments, but also has graduate schools (liberal arts, science, and economics), affiliated middle and elementary schools, night schools, and preparatory classes, a so-called "five generations under one roof," having everything one could need. Second, Chuan Da has a long history of fifty years, from the merging of the former Shixue Hall and other institutions to the present. Its development is a history of modern education in Sichuan, and the graduates of Chuan Da over these fifty years are widely distributed throughout Sichuan, serving as the driving force behind the advancement of Sichuan's governance, society, culture, and various construction projects over the decades. Therefore, Chuan Da is inextricably linked to Sichuan. Due to these two characteristics, Chuan Da can represent Sichuan education. Thus, I will provide a general introduction to Chuan Da.</p>
<p>History of Chuan Da</p>
<p>Chuan Da was formed by the merger of the former Public Sichuan University, Chengdu University, and Chengdu Normal University. The history of Public Sichuan University is the earliest, dating back to the late Qing Dynasty reforms. There were the "Shixue Hall" and the "Cunguxue Hall." In the 31st year of Guangxu, they were merged into the Sichuan School of Law and Politics. In the Republic of China, it was renamed the University of Law and Politics. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Law and Politics, Foreign Languages, and Chinese Studies specialized schools were merged into Public Sichuan University. Chengdu University and Normal University were originally the Sichuan Advanced Normal School during the Qing Dynasty. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Sichuan Higher Normal School. In the third year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the National Higher Normal School. In the 15th year, they were reorganized into Chengdu University and Normal University, respectively. In the 17th year, the University Council ordered the Sichuan Department of Education to merge all universities and specialized schools in Sichuan Province into the National Sichuan University. In the 20th year, the merger of the three universities was successful, resulting in today's Chuan Da. In the fifteen years after the merger, the presidents were Wang Zhaorong, Ren Hongjun, and Cheng Tianfang. The current president is Huang Jilu.</p>
<p>Current Overview</p>
<p>Chuan Da is currently the university with the most colleges and departments and the most complete scale in the country. The total number of students is over 5,000. The organization is divided into five systems: graduate school, university, night school and preparatory class, affiliated middle school, and elementary school. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Graduate School: There is the Graduate School of Liberal Arts, divided into four groups: language and literature, writing, history, and classics, headed by Xiang Chu. The Graduate School of Science currently has a Department of Chemistry, divided into five groups: organic, inorganic, theoretical, applied chemistry, and pharmacy, headed by Tang Xiufu. The Graduate School of Economics is a part of the Xifu Social Science Research Institute, headed by Peng Dixian, specializing in research on the economic resources, transportation, and prices of Southwest China.</p>
<p>(2) University: There are currently five colleges and twenty-three departments. The College of Law includes the Departments of Political Science, Economics, and Law, headed by Wu Yongquan. The College of Liberal Arts includes the Departments of Chinese, Diplomacy, and History and Geography, headed by Xiang Xianqiao. The College of Agriculture includes the Departments of Agronomy, Agricultural Economics, Forestry, Agricultural Chemistry, Sericulture, Horticulture, and Plant Pathology and Entomology, as well as an affiliated farm, headed by Peng Jiayuan. The College of Science and Engineering includes the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Aeronautical Engineering, as well as a chemical testing program and a practice factory, headed by Zheng Zhanhan. The Teachers College includes the Department of Education and a training department, headed by Deng Zhichun.</p>
<p>(3) Night School and Preparatory Class: The night school is specially set up by Chuan Da to help out-of-school civil servants and professional youth. After five years of study, they can still obtain a bachelor's degree. Currently, there are three groups: Chinese, Law, and Commerce, as well as a journalism program. The preparatory class aims to help middle school graduates who have not been able to enter university. Currently, there are over 2,000 students receiving university preparatory education.</p>
<p>(4) Affiliated Middle School and Elementary School: The affiliated middle school and elementary school of Chuan Da have been established for over 30 years and are schools with a good reputation in Chengdu. The current administrative system is directly under the Teachers College and is also an experimental school for the students of the college to practice and serve.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>Although Chuan Da is the highest institution of learning in the Southwest with a long history, for decades, due to the instability of the country and the constant turmoil in Sichuan, Chuan Da has been operating miserably and establishing its scale amidst difficulties and hardships. From the Shixue Hall of the late Qing Dynasty to the great merger in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, this period was a time of turbidity in Sichuan and also the dawn of new education in Sichuan. Chuan Da was brewing and sprouting during this period. From the establishment of the new Chuan Da to the present fifteen years, the situation in Sichuan has gradually improved, and education has flourished. Chuan Da has also grown and prospered. Chuan Da's development is closely related to the political situation in Sichuan and the progress of education. Therefore, in my visit to Chuan Da, from the president and professors to the students, everyone regards building a new Sichuan as the responsibility and obligation of Chuan Da. This is the current educational core idea of Chuan Da and also the educational policy for Chuan Da's future development.</p>
<p>President Huang Jilu, an old educator in the country, believes that "Chuan Da's past hard work" was arduous. Today, it has gone through a difficult journey of pioneering and brought better conditions to Chuan Da. In the future, the country's construction will involve many aspects, and the need for construction talent will be most urgent. Chuan Da enjoys superior development conditions and should take on this task as soon as possible. Chuan Da is the highest institution of learning in Sichuan Province, and Sichuan is a national construction experiment area. Cultivating senior construction talent for building a new Sichuan is Huang's ambitious plan for Chuan Da's future development. The development policy is determined by seeking balanced development in quality and quantity and expanding the number of departments, with the expectation that Chuan Da will become the university with the most departments and the best quality in the country in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Before the war, Chuan Da's campus was located at the former site of Liu Bei's Shu Han palace in Chengdu's Royal City. During the war, it was once moved to Mount Emei, one of the four famous mountains in the country. The current campus is located on the banks of the Jin River. Recently completed buildings include the library, the science and mathematics building, the chemistry building, and the Wenbin Building. The beams and pillars are splendidly decorated, and the architecture is magnificent. The Jin River surrounds the buildings, and sails come and go. Sand gulls fly in the sky. Students recite and sing in the majestic buildings, recalling the dilapidated ruins of the former Royal City and the simple and crude conditions of Mount Emei. This symbolizes the future created by Chuan Da's hard work and construction, and the future is bright.</p>

<h3>Extremely Tense Situation: Chun Mao Suffers Minor Defeat to Ren Yu, Green Forest Beats Hua Yang; Women’s Qing Zi Upsets Strong Hua</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The basketball league continued with three games last night at the Municipal Gymnasium. The highly anticipated match saw the dark horse Chun Mao, fresh from defeating Hua Lian, facing off against Ren Yu. Both teams displayed clear and skillful play. Chun Mao's Liu Fushan excelled in shooting, passing, and stealing, but his solo efforts proved insufficient. Despite repeatedly narrowing the gap to a single point, they ultimately fell short. Ren Yu, with its diverse talent and a mix of long-range and close-range shots, secured a 40-34 victory over Chun Mao. The first game of the night was a women's match between Cao Jia Ban and Women's Qing Zi. The absence of Cao Jia Ban's key player, Huang Jun, due to illness significantly weakened their morale. Women's Qing Zi, with Zhu Jin, Qian Chuping, and Jian Zhiguang displaying exceptional energy, managed to overcome Cao Jia Ban's single standout, Manli. Ultimately, they prevailed with a 27-21 upset victory over Strong Hua. In the middle game of the Class A Division, the young Green Forest team faced the hefty Hua Yang team. Despite the heavier Hua Yang taking an early lead with excellent jump shots, their slow movements became a liability. Green Forest adopted a quick offense, causing Hua Yang to panic and tire. Consequently, Green Forest won 37-34. Details of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>Women's</p>
<p>The first game was a women's match between Strong Hua and Women's Qing Zi, with Yu Ju as the referee. Strong Hua's Cao Manli scored the first point with a free throw, which was quickly answered by Women's Qing Zi's Qian Chuping with a long-range shot. Manqi and Manli then scored in succession, giving Strong Hua a 4-2 lead. However, the young and agile forwards of Women's Qing Zi helped them take a 7-4 lead in the first quarter. Cao Jia Ban's Manli remained composed, and Strong Hua managed to regain the lead 13-11 by halftime. After switching sides, Women's Qing Zi maintained their momentum, with Zhu Jinyun scoring the first basket to tie the game at 13. The third quarter ended with a 19-19 tie. In the final quarter, both teams played with extreme intensity, aware of the stakes. Women's Qing Zi's Qian Chuping made a free throw and seized opportunities under the basket, scoring two more points, leading 24-19. Cao Jia Ban's morale faltered, and although Manli scored some points, Women's Qing Zi effectively stalled, running down the clock to win 27-21, defeating Strong Hua.</p>

Ren Yu's Sun Guozheng scored from the sideline, and Shen Pengju added a layup, followed by Wang Huaiting, giving Ren Yu a 6-5 lead. Pengju and Xin Yun played exceptionally well, and although Chun Mao's Li Xianzheng and He Hanfu also contributed, Ren Yu led 18-16 at halftime. After switching sides, Ren Yu's scoring increased, and Chun Mao fell behind. They made frequent substitutions, but could not overcome Ren Yu's offense, making it 32-27. Ren Yu's Sun Guozheng fouled out and was replaced by Yao Wenyi. Chun Mao still struggled to recover. As time ran out, Ren Yu defeated Chun Mao 40-34.</p>

<h3>National Sports Association Launches Fundraising Campaign; Dong Shouyi to Visit Shanghai Tomorrow for Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 18th] The General Association of the China National Sports Advancement Association, originally located in Shanghai, suffered complete destruction of its facilities during the war. Its leased building was also reclaimed by the landlord. Therefore, after the victory and return to normalcy, the association has decided to establish its headquarters in Nanjing. To support its post-war efforts, the standing committee of the association resolved to form a Fundraising Committee to solicit donations to advance its work. This fundraising committee recently held a meeting in Shanghai, setting a minimum fundraising goal of 500 million yuan. The association's past sources of funding included: (1) central government subsidies, (2) allocations from provincial and municipal governments, (3) donations from individuals enthusiastic about sports, and (4) ticket revenue. Currently, there is no ticket revenue, so the fundraising efforts will focus on the first three sources. Dong Shouyi, the association's director-general, has concluded his participation in meetings and planning in Shanghai and arrived in Nanjing on the 17th. He is currently negotiating matters related to the headquarters building, preparing fundraising materials, and is scheduled to visit Shanghai on the 20th for further discussions.</p>

<p>The scheduled dates and times of the games will not be changed except in special circumstances at the gymnasium.</p>

<h3>Railway Small Ball Tournament: Materials Wins Over Business</h3>
<p>The Railway Department's Small Ball Tournament saw a match between the Business and Materials departments yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM at the Railway Bureau's field. The crowd was quite large, but the damp field affected the players' running. Despite the presence of renowned players like Han Longhai, Gao Baozheng, and Jin Shigui on the Business team, the Materials department's more balanced team prevailed with a score of 3-2.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes into the game, Business's Wang Changsheng received support from the midfield and scored, taking the lead. Materials was not to be outdone, as Li Houren passed to the right wing, and Yun Chanxing scored, tying the game 1-1 at halftime.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Materials' Li Houren made a solo run and scored, giving Materials a 2-1 lead. Soon after, Han Longhai launched an attack from the wing, and Gao Baozheng broke through, causing goalkeeper Wang Jie to lose his guard, tying the game 2-2 again. Five minutes before the end of the game, Materials took a shot from 20 yards away, scoring and giving Materials a 3-2 victory over Business.</p>
<h3>British Navy in Shanghai Forms Football Team; Seeks Friendly Match with Tung Wah</h3>
<p>After the British Navy's HMS Belfast football team was transferred from Shanghai last autumn, it has returned to Shanghai last week along with three other ships. These ships include many skilled football players, and the British Navy has formed a joint football team. They will seek a friendly match with the Tung Wah football team at Yiyuan this Friday, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Mengxian Cup to Open on Saturday; Longjie vs. Mengxian Exhibition Match</h3>
<p>The Mengxian Cup Small Football Tournament, organized by Mengxian Middle School, was originally scheduled to open last Saturday, but was postponed due to rain and a wet field. It will now open this Saturday with two opening matches, plus an exhibition match between Longjie and Mengxian. The Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li, will be invited to kick off the event.</p>
<h3>Sideline Notes on Basketball</h3>
<p>As predicted by this newspaper, Chun Mao lost to Ren Yu by a close margin in last night's basketball league game. The performance of both teams was up to their usual standards, and the match was a true measure of their respective strengths. Chun Mao's shooting skills were slightly inferior, and their three-basket deficit was well-deserved.</p>
<p>Ren Yu's Wang Huaiting, Sun Guozheng, and Shen Pengju performed well, but Yao Wenyi was out of sorts. Chun Mao's Fushan was tightly guarded, relying only on Jiabiao and Fuqiang for occasional scores, and He Hanfu missed several long-range shots. Xianzheng also did more harm than good.</p>
<p>Fushan, lacking opportunities to attack, switched to defense, but Ren Yu had many players skilled at shooting from the baseline, and could easily score even when pressured to the corners. Chun Mao's defense last night was not solid, and they seemed to lack both awareness and confidence.</p>
<p>Near the end of the game, Sun Guozheng fouled out, and Chun Mao was only one basket behind, hoping to turn the game around. However, Liang Yongjia made a powerful shot, dampening Chun Mao's morale.</p>
<p>Apart from an early 5-0 lead, Chun Mao was always chasing the game, trailing by five or six points.</p>
<p>Huang Tianlie's illness and the lack of replacements were also a major blow to Chun Mao. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>President Song Meets with Executive Committee of Export Promotion Council; Explains Export Promotion Policies; Transportation Inconvenience and Price Instability Offset Foreign Exchange Effects</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] President Song had not yet formally met with the executive committee members and appointed advisors of the Export Promotion Council since its establishment. Yesterday, from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM, he specially convened a meeting with relevant personnel of the council at the Bank of China Building. Attendees included Chairman Zu Yi, executive committee members Lin Fengbao, Liu Gongyun, and Shen Peirui, advisors Shu Yunzhang, Wang Yangxian, Chen Changtong, Guo Zixun, Ma Baozhi, Hu Yunqiu, Xu Xiekang, Ouyang Lun, Xu Guangchi, Mike, Rogers, Little, Keshiwei, and Zhang Sili. President Song elaborated on the government's export promotion policy and expressed his hope that all executive committee members and advisors would work hard to assist in studying ways to increase production and remove export difficulties. Subsequently, the attendees expressed their views, which are summarized as follows: (1) Transportation inconvenience is the biggest obstacle to export trade and urgently needs to be resolved. For example, the current shipping cost from Hankou to Shanghai is 20% higher than the shipping cost from Shanghai to the United States. (2) The government's adjustment of the exchange rate should help export trade. However, the price of export goods must remain stable. Otherwise, the benefits of the exchange rate adjustment will be offset by the increase in prices. As a result, the exchange rate adjustment will not be effective. For example, the prices of tung oil and bristles have already risen by 50% recently. (3) Although the government has issued a large number of production loans through the Four Joint Offices, the actual beneficiaries are large-scale manufacturers in cities. Small producers of export goods in the interior do not even know the nature of the Four Joint Offices. Moreover, it often takes more than a month for export goods to be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, it is hoped that these small producers will be provided with financial support. (4) Increasing the production of yarn is believed to be possible, but the problem of electricity supply needs to be solved. (5) Smuggling in South China should be stopped quickly, and it is hoped that the Yuehan Railway will be fully opened as soon as possible. (6) The United Kingdom has a strong demand for Chinese eggs, and export trade should be promoted immediately. After listening to the opinions of the attendees, President Song took notes and promised to give full consideration and solve the problems separately.</p>
<h3>Central Bank's Purchase of US Dollars Increasingly Crowded Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank continued to purchase gold and US dollars at the new exchange rate yesterday. The number of people seeking to exchange currency was higher than in previous days, with most seeking to exchange US dollars. In front of the foreign exchange counter in the business bureau on the second floor, people lined up in rows. Before exchanging US dollars yesterday, it was necessary to fill out a special printed exchange application form provided by the bank. Banknotes of 10 yuan and below and 20 yuan and above had to be filled out separately. It is said that the application procedure will be cancelled from today onwards, and the Central Bank will directly exchange currency based on the banknotes. According to a person in charge of the bank's business bureau, the bank uniformly accepts all denominations of US dollars and has not refused to accept US dollars of 50 yuan or more. Although the exchange volume yesterday was not clearly counted, it is estimated that it was higher than the 250,000 yuan in previous days. The amount of gold exchanged was not as high as that of US dollars, because people believe that the Central Bank's exchange rate is too low, so there were few people seeking to exchange gold. Even those who did exchange gold were mostly banks and firms exchanging it to adjust their positions. The exact number is impossible to estimate.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds' Fluctuations Limited</h3>
<p>Government bonds were relatively stable yesterday. Room 540 had buyers, Room 604 advanced then retreated, while Rooms 445 and 552 were sellers. The overall trend was limited. The morning opened at 6200 yuan, rising as high as 7300 yuan before falling back to 5700 yuan. The midday market was..., and the result was that all bonds except Type D rose slightly compared to the previous close. The volume traded was 7 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stock Market Performed Moderately</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks rebounded yesterday. Yi Sha saw a high price of 15,000 yuan in the afternoon before leveling off. Small stocks declined slightly from their highs. The overall performance was moderate. Compared to the previous close, Yi Sha and Navigation each rose by a little more than 0.5%, while British United and Defeng Steel each rose by about 0.5%. The rest declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Shops Temporarily Suspend Business; Emergency Meeting to be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Yuncheng, chairman of the Money Exchange Association, told reporters yesterday that all members of the industry have decided to temporarily suspend business until the government's new measures are announced. However, since there are many members in the industry, it is inevitable that there will be both good and bad. Therefore, an emergency meeting will be held at 3:00 PM tomorrow to urge all members to comply with the law and not engage in illegal transactions to avoid damaging the industry's reputation. In addition, some executive directors have proposed to organize an inspection team to supervise the actions of members, which will also be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Weaken Again</h3>
<p>The sugar market weakened again yesterday due to sluggish sales. The association's prices were lowered; spot medium and white sugars continued to drop slightly, while local sugars also fell by 3-5,000 yuan. Shundeqing opened at 122,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan, followed by 115,000 yuan. Daoqing opened at 125,000 yuan. A total of 2-300 bags were traded. The market is expected to rebound only when demand picks up.</p>
<p>Another report: The Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation will begin distributing sugar for the seventh time this Thursday (the 20th). In order to suppress sugar prices, the distribution of medium and red sugars will be temporarily suspended this time. The recent market price of coarse sugar has fallen to 193,000 yuan, only 3,000 yuan higher than the distribution price, and the situation suggests that there may be further declines. The company has decided to distribute a total of 29,923 bags of greedy sugar. Due to the recent decline in sugar prices, the number of applications for sugar this time is less than the sixth distribution.</p>
<h3>Market Interest Rates</h3>
<p>If the Plan is Fully Implemented, Interest Rates are Expected to Return to Lower Levels Soon</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan told reporters yesterday that if the government's emergency economic measures are fully implemented and all conditions are met, he guarantees that market interest rates in the city will fall to within 10% within a month.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>The tea market remained quiet yesterday, with few transactions. After the morning opening, the buying interest seemed active on the surface, but there were few sellers. Moreover, the asking prices were high and lacked standards. It is said that the top Qimen tea from 1945 was being quoted at 1.5 million yuan per dan, and the Chen Special Qimen tea from 1934 was also being quoted near 1 million yuan. Other new and old miniature teas and Zhenmei green teas were priced at 4-500,000 yuan to 1.2-300,000 yuan per dan. As a result, negotiations between buyers and sellers were not successful, and the market remained quiet. According to the current situation, if holders of goods remain unwilling to compromise, the quiet situation is likely to continue.</p>
<h3>With Favorable Buying News in the Final Minutes, the Stock Market's Rise Flourishes Again; Mei Ya and Xin Ya, Zhong Fa All Hit Limit Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, under tight monetary conditions, the stock market was anxious and uneasy. In addition, with the impending expiration of contracts, gains were quickly followed by declines. Only Mei Ya continued to rise due to active buying. However, in the last ten minutes, the market suddenly surged on rumors of favorable buying, ending the day at high prices.</p>
<p>The morning opened higher following the previous close. Numbers 95, 178, and 232 vigorously purchased, pushing Deyong Yarn up to 1870 yuan immediately after the opening. Numbers 224, 105, 57, and 76 sold, pushing the price down to 1780 yuan. Numbers 198, 224, 207, and 185 maintained the price at the low, pushing it back up to 1850 yuan. Numbers 14, 204, 22, and 145 were still selling, pushing the price down to 1750 yuan. Numbers 179, 172, and 215 maintained the price, pushing it up to 1780 yuan.

Buying interest suddenly surged. Numbers 152, 198, 197, 76, 224, and 145 competed to buy repeatedly. Mei Ya, with very strong buying interest from Numbers 226 and 78, surged suddenly, ending the day at a high.

For deferred delivery, Deyong Yarn, Xinhe, and Jingfu each rose by a little more than 0.5%, Xinguang rose by a little less than 0.5%, Huafeng rose by a little less than 10%, Mei Ya hit the limit up.

<h3>Silver Shop Representatives' Petition: Four Recommendations Proposed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Gold Shops Association of this city, facing stagnation after the cessation of gold trading, besides petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for relief the day before yesterday, also convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors in the afternoon to discuss future business methods. They also dispatched Qiu Tianbao, Yang Qinghe, Yao Huifang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, and other responsible representatives from Bao Cheng and other gold shops to the Municipal Government twice yesterday to petition Mayor Wu, putting forward four demands: (1) The weight of each piece of jewelry produced and sold by gold shops should not exceed two taels (關平二兩) and small bars should not be melted down for sale. (2) Gold shops should be allowed to collect scrap gold jewelry, with prices following regulations set by the Central Bank. (3) Gold collected should be used for making jewelry; any surplus should be sold to the Central Bank, and if there is a shortage, the Central Bank should be asked to allocate it. (4) Operating profit should be determined by the Gold Shops Business Association with reference to the situation and the cost of living index, and with the consent of the Central Bank. The mayor has promised to consider these requests, but the entire plan must await the Central Government's promulgation of measures regarding gold jewelry before a final decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Joint Venture Funds Not Deposited with Bank of Communications; Guidance Association Cannot Distribute Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee held a meeting yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, presided over by Chairman Lin Fengbao in person. After discussion, those present believed that since the establishment of the silk weaving joint venture company and the Guidance Committee, the company has not complied with the joint regulations by depositing all of the raised capital of 500 million yuan into the approved Bank of Communications, resulting in the Guidance Committee being unable to issue raw materials and labor costs in preparation for starting work. Although the joint venture company has requested the issuance of raw materials on the grounds that workers are about to strike and machines are idle, the Committee decided that it will only consider issuing materials after all the funds have been deposited into the Bank of Communications.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Request Loans to Support Flour Rationing Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Four Banks Joint Treasury and the Municipal Bank have decided to lend 2 billion yuan to the five major flour mills, Maoxin, Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, as funds for purchasing wheat. According to a responsible person at the Fuxin Flour Mill, the flour mills are requesting loans not to relieve their own difficulties, but to support the government's flour rationing policy. Because wheat prices have recently soared to 76,000 yuan per dan (擔), the cost of each bag of flour should be above 50,000 yuan, including raw materials and labor. In order to maintain rationing, the flour mills rely not only on government subsidies, but also on constantly subsidizing themselves, which depleted most of the wheat that the flour mills had accumulated in the past. The purpose of requesting loans is to prevent the cessation of flour rationing in this difficult environment. However, as the previous profits of the flour mills have already been used up for subsidies, they will not be able to subsidize in the future. It is not known whether the government will adopt a subsidy policy or a cost policy. Therefore, how to use this loan will depend on the government's policy.</p>
<p>Another Dispatch: The flour supply in this city is still being rationed by Shanxin Zhou at 12,000 bags of Lilang flour per day, and the negotiated price has not changed. However, starting from the 23rd of this month, it will be changed to rationed domestically produced flour, milled by the five major flour mills, Fuxin, Fu Zhi, Maoxin, Hua Yan, and Yutong, with Mayor Wu assisting in borrowing 2 billion yuan from the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The loan has been promised by the Four Banks Joint Treasury, and the flour mills have purchased wheat from various wheat-producing areas. The first batch of 110,000 dan (擔) has already arrived and is being milled intensively in order to be rationed at that time. Representatives of the five flour mills, Xi Debing, Rong Yiren, and Qian Shouchun, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to ask for instructions on the rationing procedures starting from the 23rd. Therefore, the serious flour panic problem can be resolved.</p>
<h3>White Coal Market Prices Strong</h3>
<p>White coal supplies are scarce, and due to the severe cold weather, sales are extremely strong, and the market is strong. The transaction price of Hong Kuai (鴻　塊) has reached 1.7 million yuan. The market for bituminous coal is relatively soft because 18,900 tons of coal for civilian factories will be allocated soon. However, asking prices are not willing to lower.</p>
<h3>Loans Not Allowed to Be Extended; Money Market Remains Tight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] It is reported that the recent tightness in the money market in this city is due to the fact that depositors who were restricted from depositing and withdrawing last Saturday made withdrawals from various banks before the holiday. Therefore, the money market of each bank was greatly drained, and the exchange was quite tight. On Monday of this week, the China Trust Bureau Textile Construction Company and others sold materials, which contracted a large amount of money. The result of the exchange of each bank on Monday was that the four banks and two bureaus were short of more than 20 billion yuan. Yesterday, it improved slightly, but the four banks and two bureaus were only short of 1 billion yuan. It is heard that the four banks and two bureaus have recently not allowed the extension of various loans that have expired. The amount of money recovered successively is also huge, so the money market is extremely tight.</p>
<h3>Barter Trade with Japan Continues to Be Handled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau, acting as the government's agent for barter trade with Japan, requested the import of 10 million pit props from Japan this year, but Japan can only supply 4 million. We also requested that Japan continue to supply rayon, but it is likely that the quantity that can be supplied will not be large, as Japanese inventory is exhausted and new production is not large. In addition, about ten transportation materials must also be imported from Japan. Japan requested that our country supply 1 million tons of edible salt, and it is currently planned to supply more than 700,000 tons. To date, 50,000 tons have been shipped out.</p>
<h3>Rice Arrives Vigorously; Early Rice Falls Below 100,000 Yuan; Flour Market Sluggish; Vegetable Oil Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice arrival statistics broke the record for the past few months. The South City Market arrived with 22,84146 shi (石), the North City Market arrived with 9,624 shi (石), for a total of 12,000 shi (石). The sources from all roads are surging vigorously. At this time, the government is implementing emergency economic measures, and will strictly manage people's food. Coupled with the tight money supply, the owners are eager to sell, while the streets are mostly waiting and watching, and the market is declining section by section. Thick and thin japonica rice continue to decline by 5,600 yuan, each grade of indica rice fell by 3,400 yuan, Yin Bian Yuan (蔭變元) also fell by 5,600 yuan, Changxi japonica price is at 112,000 yuan, and early rice has fallen below 100,000 yuan. The North City price is lower than the South City.</p>
<p>Flour: another decline reported, the rice market continues to weaken, the market is sluggish, the flour mill is constantly distributing, the actual sales are feeling the obstruction, the market is full of selling atmosphere. But the receiving is lacking, the transaction is still rare, and the market price is weakening step by step. In the morning, the ship powder was 50,000 yuan, Lilang foreign powder was 70,000 yuan, and the small price declined by 2,000 yuan, with only a few transactions. The later market situation allows the emptiness, and the Lilang ocean flour fell below 70,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 68,500 yuan, and the ship powder was heard that 48,000 yuan still has a family, and the actual fall is 3,400 yuan compared to the previous day, and the bran is tired with the flour market about 2,000 yuan. The wheat ground is very strong, but there is no transaction.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Continuing the fatigue of the last few days, coupled with the close monitoring of the Social Bureau, the market is afraid, and the transactions are lonely. The raw materials (raw peanut soybean) step down, the merchants and retail investors are rushing to sell, but the sales are sluggish, the price of raw oil is about 20,000 yuan, and the price of raw oil is about 200,000 yuan on the edge, and the bean oil market is also reduced by 10,000 yuan. The price of small car sesame oil fell by 10,000 yuan, and the price of raw vegetable oil at this factory retreated to 235,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: All reported weak, and there are not enough sources of soybeans, and the sales are not smooth, and continue to plummet by 3,400 yuan, and Pinghu beans also dumped by 5,600 yuan. The raw materials are more than the demand, and the price is down by about 10,000 yuan. Because the Zhongzhi factory is trying to open up, the price of sesame fell by 20,000 yuan. The red bean market continued to fall by 4,000 yuan, and the green bean sales slowed down, and also fell by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum and corn are gradually reduced by 2,000 yuan, and the sales of bean cake are narrow, and the price is reduced by 2,000 yuan. Only broad beans are in the midst of the fatigue of each product, and the shouting price is still very strong, but there is no transaction.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Customer Sales Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market still did not improve, customer sales were still quiet, and the money market was tight as before. Various yarns below 42 counts fell again by 210,000, and the special double horse first fell to 3.6 million, followed by absorption from the Cantonese gang, and rose to 3.95 million at the close, which was more than 100,000 yuan better than yesterday. However, people are still not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Buy Back Cotton Yarn; Pricing Methods Specified</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Textile Management Committee (1) The pricing method for each factory to buy back cotton yarn for its own weaving will be handled according to the fourth day's price of the Textile Construction Acting and Operating Office, starting from the date when each factory submits the cotton yarn sales notice to the Textile Management Committee. (2) After each factory submits the cotton yarn sales notice to the Textile Management Committee, if the grade approval procedure cannot be completed within three days due to the inspection procedure, the majority of the yarn price will be paid first on the fourth day to avoid the turnover of each factory. (3) The original standard for the method of inspecting the quality of cotton yarn was eight types. It is now decided that item 8, the bundling package, will not be included in the inspection standard. Also, item 6, the content of the skein, and item 7, the length of the skein circle, will also not be included temporarily. It will be restored to the list from April 1.</p>
<h3>Batch of Foreign Flour Arrives at the Port</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Flour arrived at the port yesterday. The Dashun Wheel, represented by Baoli Company, is a new wheel purchased by the Materials Supply Bureau in Canada. It was the first batch in Shanghai yesterday. 3,450 packages of flour were loaded from Vancouver. The flour was purchased by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Adjusts Exchange Rates in Various Regions; Chongqing Banks Request to Increase Exchange Amount Denied</h3>
<p>Amidst the gold and currency turmoil, applications for remittances in various regions have undergone drastic changes. Various companies and banks have transferred funds to Shanghai to snap up materials and gold and currency, and the exchange fee has increased to more than 100 yuan per thousand. Since the government announced emergency economic measures, the money supply in various regions has turned tight. According to the report received by the Bank of China, the exchange fee in Qingdao is 40 yuan, Hankou is 20 yuan, Guangzhou is 20 to 30 yuan, and Wenzhou is as high as 110 yuan, which is too far from the official exchange rate. The Central Bank has specially considered the market conditions in various regions and stipulated the exchange rate to various regions for the four banks and two bureaus on the 17th. The rates for Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other regions have been adjusted, and some have doubled. Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian have been adjusted to 28 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. Other regions remain at 30 yuan. Shantou in Guangdong is 50 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan, and other regions are 50 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. Shandong is 10 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. In Hubei, only Hankou and Wuchang are 5 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. In Zhejiang, only Wenzhou is 25 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. There is no change in Shanxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, Hebei, Guangxi, Anhui, and other regions. In addition, the Central Bank previously maintained the original regulations because commercial banks in Chongqing and other regions have repeatedly requested to increase the amount of remittances. Because the various commercial groups come to Shanghai to purchase goods, Shanghai can do import remittance, and various regions can apply for remittance to the national banks.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Weaken</h3>
<p>Since the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, industrial raw materials were not traded the day before yesterday, and the market was extremely chaotic. Yesterday, because the silver market was tight, prices weakened except for a slight increase in sulfuric acid. The price of Yuepai caustic soda was 6 million yuan, and the price of American caustic soda was 5.8 million yuan. The price of Yuepai soda ash once rose to 500,000 yuan per bag, and the current market price is 350,000 yuan. Magali soda ash fell from 280,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan. Glycerin fell by 200,000 yuan, and the asking price per onion was 1.5 million yuan. Bleaching powder fell from 2.6 million yuan per supplement to 2 million yuan. Coconut oil fell from 800,000 yuan per dan (担) to 550,000 yuan. The feet of each thing are very strong, and the decline is very small.</p>
<h3>Pig Bristles Opening Price Not Available; Export Price Quite Cost-Effective</h3>
<p>The supply of pig bristles in the Shanghai market is scarce, and the export price is difficult to match the domestic price. After the foreign exchange rate was raised yesterday, the merchants were waiting for the situation in the producing area to determine the opening price in Shanghai. Therefore, there was no opening price until late at night. According to people in the industry, the overseas market price of Chongqing No. 27 for delivery in New York is US$2.7 per pound, and each Sima dan (司馬担) (i.e., one box of 133 pounds) is equivalent to 4.2 million national currency. The price of Hankou No. 17 bristles is 4.1 yuan per pound, and each Sima dan is about 6.5 million national currency. The price of Shanghai No. 17 bristles is 2 yuan per pound, which is about 3.2 million national currency. After removing taxes and water feet, the current domestic price can be increased a lot.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Asking Price Chaotic</h3>
<p>The tung oil market is rampant due to the rampant smuggling in Guangzhou. Therefore, normal exports have run counter to market prices, and inventories in various places are extremely thin. The tung oil production area of Hunan and Hubei tung oil is almost entirely through the Yuehan Road (粵漢路) to Guangzhou, and transshipped to Hong Kong. Only the Zhongzhi factory has a small amount of tung oil exports in this city. Since each merchant has no source and the export price is not in line, and the market price has risen sharply from the producing area, it is rising slowly. Yesterday's market has raised the foreign exchange, and the latest New York Telegraph price is 3.75 US dollars per pound for New York delivery, which has increased the export value to 500,000 yuan per dan (担) (121 pounds). It seems that the export prospect is optimistic. Yesterday's asking price was as high as 450,000 yuan per dan (担), which has risen by 80,000 yuan from 380,000 yuan per dan (担) last Saturday, but the official market is still unable to open.</p>
<h3>Wool Exports Hopeful After Exchange Rate Adjustment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai wool price has not been officially opened yet, and the price of wool in the producing area is said to have been slightly higher, but very few people went to purchase it. The sheep wool production season in this spring will be more than a month later, so the current wool stock in the producing area is still the autumn wool last year. After the foreign exchange was revised this time, the wool that can be exported in Shanghai is estimated to be about 10,000 dan (担). A certain fur shop in this question received a telegram from abroad, because the wool sample sent can only be used for manufacturing blankets, etc., so its offer is 4.2 corners per pound of net goods. If it is a wool product (i.e., goods that have not been sorted and selected), it must be priced at 60% off. However, according to people in the industry, according to the conversion of the price, the wool that has been shipped to foreign countries and not sold, and the stock wool in this city, if the foreign sales are good, it can be slightly profitable, and sold as much as possible. However, the future situation depends on how much the price in the producing area rises to and whether the price abroad falls.</p>

<h3>Tanglou Thirty Miles of Fragrant Snow Sea</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 10th [date not given]. Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this newspaper.</p>
<p>As spring approaches, the people who live on the shores of West Lake, and those who are thinking of coming to West Lake to play, will be drawn to the plum blossoms. Perhaps in this turbid world, only the plum still maintains its purity and loftiness, fearless of frost and snow, symbolizing the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and indomitability of our Chinese nation. In order to report on the plum blossoms, the reporter has visited Lin Bu's former residence—Solitary Hill—three times, and Lingfeng twice, but the spring plum blossoms are still shy and unwilling to show their faces. On the 8th, I went to Solitary Hill again with a few friends in a boat, but there was still no news of blooming. The woman selling tea at Fanghe Pavilion told me: "When the weather gets warmer, they will slowly open." On the 9th, I decided to go to Chaoshan, Tangqi, to explore the plum blossoms. Because there was no sign at the intersection of the three roads to Tangqi, we almost sent us to Haining. We came back again, asked passers-by, and finally embarked on the road to Tangqi. The road was very bumpy. Several bridges could still be seen, and they were built elaborately before the war. We met several buses of the Transportation Department on the road, and they were shaking and swaying. I think the road should be repaired, and a prominent sign should be nailed at the intersection, so that those who admire the plum blossoms in the future will not take the wrong path.</p>
<p>A Prosperous Town of Fruit Production</p>
<p>Speaking of Tanglou, this is a relatively large and prosperous town, known for its fruits. The canal runs through the whole area, with many ports and rivers. There is more land than fields, and most people make a living by picking and selling fruits. The famous Tangqi loquat can produce 80,000 to 90,000 loads per year, plums can produce 120,000 to 130,000 loads, lotus roots can produce 30,000 to 40,000 loads, and other bayberries, peaches, sugar cane, water chestnuts, and cherries have a large output. Loquats are divided into red and white. The white sand loquat is so tender to the touch that it is not easy to transport. The lotus root is crushed when it falls to the ground, and it is indescribably tender. I think the white sand loquat is so tender, it is really precious, and we should try to improve the transportation in the future, so that this sweet loquat will not be enjoyed only by the people of Tangqi. Other fruits are sold to Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places. There is an old store called Huichang in Tangqi Town, specializing in the production of candied fruits, and the business is booming. Later, people from Suzhou and Shanghai came to purchase. Some purchased raw fruits and brought them back to make their own. Shanghai Guanshengyuan came to Tangqi to build a plum forest specifically for the production of candied plums, and Suzhou Zhangxiangfeng also set up a line every year to search for plums. This year, Shanghai's Meilin Company will set up a factory in Tanglou, specializing in the production of candied fruit canned foods.</p>
<p>Since most people in Tangqi make a living by selling fruits, the sales of fruits last year were not bad, so this strong counter-current did not affect them fortunately, but due to the impact of the general economic downturn in the country, it is inevitable that they also appear strong on the outside but empty inside.</p>
<p>We asked the locals to accompany us back to Chaoshan, which is about six Huali (華里). The tour companion told me: "These days, there has been an endless stream of cars. They all came to explore the plum blossoms, thinking that the plum blossoms should bloom in the first month, but who knew that the plum blossoms of Chaoshan should be after the Awakening of Insects." The plum blossoms of Chaoshan are called home plums, and the home plums bear large fruits. The plums of Solitary Hill and Lingfeng are wild plums, and wild plums are early-maturing and bear small fruits. The plum area here is centered on the Daming Hall of Chaoshan, east to Taishan, Tunli, southwest to Dushan, Qiancun, north to Guishan, Dongxi two villages, Ma'an, Huanggu, Bai Li Zhushan, along Dongjia Bridge, Quanzhang and across Jiaoxi, surrounded by more than 30 Li (里), criss-crossed, about millions of trees. When the flowers bloom, the fragrance is heard more than ten miles away, the flower paths are winding, the chickens crow and the dogs bark, which has the fun of a paradise. The painter Wu Changshuo loved this holy land, so he had the sentence "Plum blossoms are what I love, and I will be buried in Chaoshan after death." After Wu's death, he was buried here, with an epitaph written by Zhang Binglin and written by Yu Youren. There is also a stone statue of Wu, holding a book in his hand, overlooking the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Song Plum by the Temple Side; Plum Forest in Front of the Temple</p>
<p>We were led to Daming Hall, where there is Bao Ci Temple. There are dozens of plum trees in front of the temple, and the buds on the branches are only sprouting and have not yet blossomed. A Song Plum on the side of the temple, half of which is withered and old, and half of which is still full of life, stands alone on a stone. A Song Plum Pavilion has been built in front of the plum, and Wu Changshuo and others have inscribed couplets. The buds of this Song Plum seem to be larger than other trees, and the flowers are mostly six-petaled, which is very different from ordinary plums. She has read all the human disasters and sorrows, and still maintains the vigor of youth, which is a great warning to those who are depressed.</p>
<p>Enter Bao Ci Temple, climb Xianghai Pavilion, and look down on the plum forest in front of the building. When the plum blossoms are in full bloom, it is like riding a boat, wandering on the Xianghai, at that time all worldly thoughts disappear, and a kind of selfless spirit rises again. The Kang Youwei's Zhongtang couplet is hung upstairs, all of which are reading praises to this great fragrant snow sea. Downstairs, winding and twisting, the steps lead to the back hall. In the hall, there is a stone carved painting tablet of Guanzizai, with vigorous brush strokes and lifelike posture. It turns out that it was written by Wu Daozi of the Tang Dynasty. On both sides is a couplet, which is titled by Yu Quyuan: "Buddha stone does not grind Tang pen and ink, immortal plum still occupies Song years." It is enough to shine the Tang paintings and Song Mei are still there!</p>
<p>The tour companion told me: "Before the war, there were also many plum branches beside the highway, which were cut down by the enemy and puppets." I think we can continue to plant peach and plum trees in the future, and even this more than 20-kilometer-long highway can be planted with peach and plum trees, so that tourists can follow the plum blossoms and complete a great scenic spot.</p>
<p>I have studied why there are so many plum blossoms in Chaoshan. According to research, the Song Dynasty moved south and established its capital in present-day Hangzhou. Princess Song Fu built a villa in Tangqi, and Chaoshan should be the location of the plum garden. These classics are detailed in the chronicles of Hangzhou or Tangqi. We don't need to deeply study them, but we recognize Tangqi as a vast farm, with excellent water conservancy and soil conditions, and plums are everyone's agricultural products. If we can advocate improvement, we can not only create a scenic spot, but also use this wealth to enrich the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Xi'an in the Cold of Spring</h3>
<p>— Xi'an Air Mail, February 10th, by our Xi'an reporter, Li Chi</p>
<p>After passing "Yangguan," passing "Yinguan," passing "Yuanji," and passing "Lichun," it is spring, but the warm spring sun always hides in the gloomy clouds. Yesterday, an inch of thick snow fell, truly embodying the cold of spring, still enveloping the ancient city of Chang'an.</p>
<p>"New Year" is a "checkpoint"; in addition to the two Yuan festivals, ordinary people face 365 difficult hurdles in life. Old news again: this "Yinguan" is particularly difficult for some wealthy individuals because the 2 billion loan borrowed from the Four Banks for life-saving during "Yangguan" must be repaid before "Yinguan," making people worry if the "collapsing wind" spreading everywhere will blow into Guanzhong. Don't worry, an unexpected "rescue" has arrived. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is blocked. The news spreads, and the market value of all Shanghai and American goods is like a horse off the rein, shrimp in a pot, running and jumping. Gold does not lag behind, passing 400,000, nearly "Five Checkpoints," slaying "Six Generals," passing "Seven Immortals." One and a half million worth of flour is being held back, not selling at the current price of 50,000 to 60,000, watching it rise to 70,000 to 80,000, the negotiating chip is equivalent to "drawing with four opponents." ... The one calculating on the abacus changed from anxiety to laughter. New Year gongs and drums, Lantern Festival lanterns, the streets seem to be a scene of complete peace!</p>
<p>The Spring Festival is Not Lively</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while we speak of peace, the flames of war are everywhere, a beautiful scene, but the difficulty of livelihood is hard to hide. Foreigners take the sales of Christmas gifts as an indicator of economic prosperity; similarly, the consumption during the Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival can measure the level of social purchasing power. This spring, the merchants selling New Year goods all shake their heads, whether wholesale or small vendors selling firecrackers by the roadside. The lantern market during the "Shangyuan" is crowded, but the most popular are still the cheapest small lanterns. The villagers buy one as a formality. In the past, the "Lantern Festival" would last three nights, but this year only the first night had a few sparks sparsely decorating the cold spring night sky. Children are not satisfied, and adults are reminiscing about the Lantern Festival nights before last year.</p>
<p>Similar in nature to Shanghai's City God Temple, the Minle Garden area of Xi'an has passed a desolate Spring Festival that should have been bustling. In the storytelling theaters around 2 or 3 pm on a festive afternoon, there are only one or two customers who can afford a cup of clear tea costing 600 yuan. Where can the hungry eyes of the drum girls on stage find prey? In the fourth-class public prostitution area next to it, there is still snow on the thatched roofs. The "meat market" where transactions can be made for the price of two or three pounds of flour cannot afford to burn charcoal. Is it the foul smoke of burning horse manure that irritates the eyes of those waiting to be "sold" by the door, causing them to shed tears? Everywhere is cold!</p>
<p>Shadows of Life</p>
<p>The shadows of life are constantly tracking. The price index for January has been released: taking the average of the first half of the 26th year as the base of 100, the Xi'an wholesale price index for January of this year is 1.13 million, and the retail price index is 1.12 million. Looking at the cost of living index for civil servants in the Xi'an area, January of this year has increased by 13,300 times compared to the first half of the 26th year of the Republic! This is a figure that the ruling authorities should seriously consider, a merciless figure. According to the current central standards, the cost-of-living allowance for Xi'an public educators is 110,000 yuan, with a salary increase of 750 times. The numbers are starkly in front of us. An allowance of 110,000 yuan is only equivalent to eight yuan before the war. A salary of 100 yuan, and the current income of 75,000 yuan, is also only equivalent to 5.6 yuan before the war! In total, a person with a salary of 100 yuan, although inflated to 185,000 yuan now, can only be exchanged for goods in Xi'an equivalent to 13.6 yuan before the war. An average person with a family of five can actually obtain only 2.7 yuan per person. The numbers speak for themselves!</p>
<p>The tuition fee for middle school students this semester has increased to 120,000, and there were rumors of 200,000. Even 200,000 is only equivalent to 15 yuan before the war, which is not too much, but the reporter saw an old teacher unable to continue to afford his children's middle school education this spring. Those who want to study cannot afford such a large burden, and those who teach do not have enough income to cover their expenses. This disconnect has a profound impact, and its negative consequences may continue into the 1920s.</p>
<p>Public educators in the Xi'an area have repeatedly appealed because the prices here have caught up with those in Beijing and Shanghai, but their treatment is ranked in the third tier nationwide. This unreasonable discrimination, as evidenced by the above figures, really needs to be improved.</p>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Solutions</p>
<p>Will the nationwide industrial and commercial crisis really not strike Shaanxi? Of course, it will not be an exception. The question is only when and to what extent. Business leaders in the city held a symposium today at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to jointly discuss rescue plans. Several concrete measures were formulated at the meeting, mainly: (1) Following the precedent of Beijing and Shanghai, a "loan syndicate" will be organized by more than 80 military units from the city's commercial banks and money shops to borrow large sums from the Four Banks and re-lend them to small and medium-sized businesses. (2) The amount, allocation, methods, procedures, etc., will be formulated by industrial and commercial organizations first and then reviewed by the banking industry. (3) The banking industry will establish a reserve fund. (4) Loan collateral can be either machinery or manufactured goods. (5) Large commercial and industrial enterprises may not apply for this type of loan. ...</p>

<h3>Old Mother Mourns American Soldier, Wang Lingji Presents Porcelain to Console Her</h3>
<p>— Nanchang, February 12th</p>
<p>Jiangxi Provincial Chairman Wang Lingji recently received a letter from an elderly American woman stating that her son, Mike McLellan, flew a C-10 aircraft to assist ground troops during the Chinese War of Resistance and was killed in the skies over Jiangxi. Hearing that Jiangxi Province will establish a national porcelain kiln, she requested a piece of product from the kiln as a memorial to ease her late-life sorrow for her son.</p>
<p>The porcelain that this old woman hoped to receive has now been fired. The porcelain was procured by Chairman Wang Lingji entrusting the Fuliang County government to arrange for it. There are a total of four pieces of porcelain, including a pair of porcelain vases and a pair of porcelain bowls. The blanks are all top-quality products. The vases are seven inches high, two inches in diameter at the mouth, and three inches wide. The bowls are two inches high and four inches in diameter at the mouth. The overall pattern on the vases, except for two areas reserved for painting, imitates the Qianlong imperial kiln's "hanging lamp foreign lotus brocade ground." The four paintings on the vases are all eagles, one titled "Looking Far Ahead" and the other titled "Qi Fills the Blue Void." The bowls are as thin as paper, as white as jade, and painted with a "Three Heroes Standing Together" picture. The mouths and bottoms of the vases and bowls are all coated with red gold, exquisite and unparalleled. The artist who did the painting and decoration was Mr. Liu Yucen, a famous painter from Jingdezhen.</p>

<h3>Although the Gate of Guanzhong is Open, Some Still Want to Close Themselves Off</h3>
<p>The most successful way to implement a measure is through "official document implementation," and there will probably be a period for that. Even if it is implemented, it is only a "treat the head when it hurts" temporary solution, not a thorough countermeasure. Some newspapers have advocated trying to minimize the connection between Xi'an's industrial and commercial activities and the economic centers of Beijing and Shanghai. In fact, Xi'an has recently had times when it could not remit money to Shanghai, which is probably a concrete measure of this "theory." We immediately saw the consequences: the black market remittance rate suddenly increased, increasing the costs for the business community and the burden for consumers. The gate of Guanzhong is open, but some want to close themselves off.</p>
<p>Recently, there seem to be rumors circulating in the market that are difficult to judge, both rumors and reports. A few days ago, an evening newspaper used "Unclear Situation in Taiyuan" as a headline, while a certain newspaper yesterday "remotely corresponding" with "Capture of Linyi" as the headline. In addition, some people used the tone of "Quietly Telling You" to talk about the Xunhua, Sanyuan, and Yijun counties south of the Shaanxi-North bunker line, saying this and that. Others described the Zhengwu County north of the Qinling Mountains and Shang County in southern Shaanxi in great detail, as if they had seen it all with their own eyes. However, the news policy from above remains unchanged. ...</p>

<h3>Streetcar Numbers Should Have Additional Devices</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>On the twelfth of this month, I went to Zhabei for business. It rained that day, so I wore a raincoat. When I returned, I hired a pedicab at the intersection of Henan North Road and Wujin Road, and placed the raincoat on the pedicab. When I arrived at my doorstep, I got out of the pedicab in a hurry and forgot the raincoat on the pedicab. After I found out, the pedicab was already far away. I think if other people forget more valuable items, it might lead to unfortunate things like bankruptcy and suicide. Therefore, I suggest that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in addition to the magnetic license plate issued on the back of pedicabs, also produce and issue a small enamel plate with the same number as the license, installed in a place easily visible to passengers. In this way, passengers who carry items can record the number. In case of forgetting, they can track down the lost items by the number. (Su Huimin)</p>
<p>Reply to Shi Choushi</p>
<p>Regarding the letter complaining about the illegal actions of Zhujing Police Officer, we have now received a reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating: "According to the Jinshan County Government's investigation and reply, the police officer Zheng Bucai did not engage in any illegal activities, and the original accusers Shi Choushi and Shi Zhongliang could not be found. Although a notice was posted in the newspaper, there was no response. Further investigation of this case revealed that the Civil Affairs Department had received a complaint from the said Shi Choushi, which was investigated and replied to by the Third District Administrative Inspector's Office, stating that the allegations against the police officer were not true, and the original plaintiff was also non-existent. It has been approved to dismiss the matter." Special delivery</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast in His Hometown of Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>— Nanchang Air Mail, February 20th, by our reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>Director Xiong Tianyi, taking advantage of his trip from the Northeast to Beijing to report on his work, returned to his ancestral home in Jiangxi to sweep the tombs. In order to accept the sincere welcome from the elders of Jiangxi whom he had bid farewell to for several years, he participated in many public welcome meetings, banquets, and met with friends from all sides. The day before yesterday, he reported on the general situation in the Northeast at the Provincial Government's Memorial Week. Although this information has been seen in newspapers, it is still considered the first relatively detailed public talk by someone who is in charge of the actual work in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong first talked about Japan's governance of the Northeast. He said: "Japan ruled the Northeast for fourteen years. Its consistent policy was to Japanize the Northeast. Therefore, all facilities were built in accordance with this policy. In the military aspect, they naturally stepped up vigilance against the Soviet Union, paid close attention to maintaining security. The "Red Beard" bandits with history in the Northeast also dared not come out and move around in the important areas under Japanese rule. For the people who surrendered, they absolutely guaranteed the safety of their lives. In the political aspect, all the methods adopted were to facilitate control. At most, the Northeast was divided into twenty-one provinces, and later changed to fourteen provinces. The regions varied in size, and the government organizations each had their corresponding establishments. The administrative officials were absolutely guaranteed, and their salaries were all paid by the central government. The village and town Baojia organizations were quite sound.</p>
<p>Talking about the process of receiving the Northeast, he traced a foreign affairs story about the Northeast. He first explained: The Cairo Conference the year before last had a statement that the Northeast should be returned to China. Before Japan surrendered, the government had sent brothers to the Soviet Union to negotiate the issue of jointly fighting against Japan. Coincidentally, Japan announced its surrender in August of the same year. At that time, Foreign Minister Wang signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and the Soviet Union reiterated its respect for China's sovereignty in the Northeast. After the brothers returned to Chongqing, they were sent to the Northeast to be responsible for handling the work of receiving it. He divided this difficult and arduous task into four stages: (1) the diplomatic reception stage. (2) the military reception stage. (3) the political reception stage. (4) the military and political reception stage. Now it is a stage where the reception work is stagnant. In the diplomatic reception stage, it ended due to various difficulties in negotiations. In the military reception stage, our side used military force to retake important towns such as Jinzhou, Siping, and Changchun from the Communist army. In the political reception stage, there was no progress due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity in negotiations. Currently, because the military is subject to the restrictions of the ceasefire agreement, and political negotiations are mostly shelved, the reception work has temporarily stopped. Our army has considerable strength in the Northeast and has an absolute overwhelming advantage over the Communist army. The Soviet Union is also very friendly to us. Whether the Northeast can be fully received in the future remains to be seen by the decisions of our central government.</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, according to Mr. Xiong, the provinces that have been received are gradually getting on track. From a military point of view, in addition to the national army stationed in various important locations and temporarily adopting a defensive posture, they are working hard to establish security teams in various provinces and counties, giving them strict training, and striving to tighten the organization of the people in order to curb the wandering of bandits. Politically, the provincial and county organizations have restored the various establishments stipulated by the central government since December last year, and have smoothly implemented government orders in the four provinces of Jilin, Liaobei, Liaoning, and Andong. Financial tax revenue will be collected starting this year, with two dou of sorghum per yuan. It is believed that in the future, the finances of the provinces and counties in the Northeast will not be in dire straits. At the same time, training institutions are established to train political cadres at all levels. Economically, there are about three parts to the reception: (1) factory and mining assets. (2) materials. (3) real estate. Most of the above three items have been received, and transportation has been largely restored. In terms of education, the higher education institutions that have been restored include Northeast University, Changchun University, Changchun Normal College, and Shenyang Medical College. All primary and secondary schools have also resumed classes, but many teachers are not qualified, and efforts are being made to train a large number of excellent teachers to meet current needs.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Xiong put forward some opinions on the relationship between the Northeast and Jiangxi: (1) China must embark on industrialization. Jiangxi is now implementing a five-year construction plan, and its focus is also on developing industry. Although the industrial equipment in the Northeast has been damaged by the Communist Party and a part has been moved away by the Soviet Union, there is still a scale left. Jiangxi should cultivate industrial and technical talents and can directly send outstanding industrial newcomers to the Northeast factories for practice. (3) Products from the Northeast industry can be used by Jiangxi, and Jiangxi's special products, such as tea, are also urgently needed in the Northeast, so they can be circulated with each other. (3) In the past, during the enemy's "Manchukuo" rule in the Northeast, there were also some political advantages, such as: (1) The county magistrate paid close attention to the people's lives, such as security and hygiene, and handled them very seriously. (2) The principle of giving first and then taking was mostly used for taxing the people. They must first assist the people in production and increase production. (3) Developing public undertakings to enrich financial income, etc., are all sufficient for us to adopt and implement.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Beautiful Mountain City</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>In the summer of the second year of the War of Resistance, when I drifted from Hankou to Chongqing, I wrote a newsletter in the journal of the Chinese Writers' Association, wanting to tell the writers who were stranded in Hankou not to regard Shu as a dangerous path. I deliberately put forward a tempting topic——Beautiful Mountain City, doing my best to praise it. At that time, I also felt it was a bit too much. Today, when I occasionally flip through the old manuscripts, I feel it's not enough, I still have to continue the topic from eight years ago——Beautiful Mountain City, and continue writing.</p>
<p>Who can deny that this mountain city surrounded by the Jialing River and the Yangtze River is a lighthouse in the storm, a command post for the War of Resistance, and is equally important, or even more important, than Washington, London, and Kuibyshev! Within the scope extended by the old city walls, although it has not been conveniently carved into a natural garden, as long as you step out of the suburbs or cross the river to Jiangbei and the South Bank, no matter which mountain, rock, hot spring, or historical site, if moved to Jiangnan, it will definitely be praised and sung by poets and writers, and be amazed as a miracle of the world. I remember that my brother Hu Feng also wrote an article about his impressions of the mountain city in the "Front Line" of the Ta Kung Pao. But he couldn't see where the beauty of the mountain city lay, as if I had deceived him. After the victory, he flew to Shanghai long ago. When he recalls the mountain city and writes another article about his impressions of the mountain city, maybe his views will be different from before.</p>
<p>During the war, the mountain city was crowded with all kinds of people. Some people from Jiangnan, who were chased by the Japanese invaders and had to come here to take refuge, often boasted that Jiangnan was good, Jiangnan was better than the rugged Shu. When the beautiful days of spring and autumn come, when the red apricot blossoms bloom and the green willow birds sing, you can sail the Huafang of West Lake, appreciate the plum blossoms of Dengwei, pick the green celery of Xuanwu, and step on the red leaves of Qixia. Jiangnan lingers in the dreams of the people of Jiangnan. It's been eight years. Now that I've heard the firecrackers celebrating victory, why not return! My home is also by the side of Jiangyu Taihu Lake, not on the Songhua River in the Northeast, but I still miss the beautiful mountain city.</p>
<p>Beautiful Mountain City! Under your protection, the Chinese nation has passed the final crisis. I don't know how many heroic fighters, generous heroes, and righteous people who sacrificed their families to help the country wrote bloody epics. But there were also countless demons who spread plagues and created evils here, making you unclean. Today, you seem more peaceful and beautiful!</p>
<p>People all like to "compete for fame in the court, and compete for profit in the market," how is this different from cattle and sheep choosing water and grass to live on? My hometown has now become a den of fame and fortune. I am afraid to see the faces of those who compete for fame and fortune. I am also worried that the insects that are trampled on will be crushed to pieces under their feet. This New Year, I received letters from friends in Jiangnan thousands of miles away, inquiring about my return date. That piece of touching affection can even tease my reverie; but looking eastward, I don't know what era it is in the world. Let's just watch this phenomenon that is evolving in the high mountain city!</p>
<p>Alas! The years urge people to grow old and tender, and the heroic spirit of going forward courageously has been exhausted in the eight long years of war and one and a half years of peaceful hardship! Seeing the competitive people in the long years, flying north to Yan, going south to Wu, or sightseeing in the "upper country" and lecturing in "that beauty", not hesitating to abandon the rest of their lives of suffering, and immersing themselves in the vast sea of people, bare-chested and fighting, swimming desperately to catch the resources of survival, I can only admire their "fighting spirit", and feel ashamed that I am a defeated coward in the battlefield of life! But there are also some strong and young men who claim to be heroes of copper muscles and iron bones, and who return without being late in life, and whose "fighting spirit" does not lag behind, and who repeatedly write letters, painfully recounting their encounters, sobbing and weeping, unable to control themselves, almost having the feeling of "there is no door in the sky, and no way to enter the earth", then, how can a lonely and helpless person like me not be discouraged! Fortunately, today's mountain city is not so bad. Most people have not lost the sympathy that should exist between people. Everyone does not adopt the vicious intention of "harming others to benefit oneself". They still tell the truth, rely on their conscience, and act with integrity. On the night of the Lantern Festival, they can still watch the lion and dragon lanterns running and jumping with a carefree smile on their faces. Even if there are a few people who don't know what to do and want to use the opportunity of having a lot of people on the street to carry out anti-whatever propaganda, even if they speak until their tongues are broken and their breath is not connected, it seems that it is far less attractive than a paper-paste dragon lantern or a lifelike lion, running and jumping on the street!</p>
<p>The early spring in the mountain city is protected by the mountains, and the Siberian cold current, even if it has flowed through the Hetao area, affecting Tianjin and gradually approaching the Central Plains, will not visit the mountain city. There is also a "Tung Flower Cold" in February here, but it is not as uncomfortable as the spring cold in Jiangnan. Strange, "fog season" is already a habitual term. In winter, there is always a bright big sun, like a natural stove, warming the mountain city and warming everyone's body. The people who live here, their hearts will not be so cold that they freeze, I think it has something to do with the early appearance of the sun. In spring, the fields are full of green, and the bean seedlings are full of countless fluttering butterflies, as if swaying in the dance hall of the Paramount. The streets selling flowers are full of flowers, all kinds of flowers. Nature has tried to use the skills of a barber to arrange the young wheat on the ridges extremely evenly, and in the gentle spring breeze, they rise up with amorous ripples like the soft hair of girls. In Nanshan, which is full of romantic history and has been the site of many love-struck men and women duels, love killings, and love nests, the pine breeze roars like waves, and wild flowers bloom in unison. The birds have already started their singing concerts in the forest. The tea trees growing in the secluded valleys are also blooming. The farmers are picking new buds, drying them, and brewing them with boiling spring water, which is no less than the Dragon Well of West Lake. In my spare time during the New Year, I have often sailed with two or three close friends on the small stream of Nanquan. The new rain accumulated on both sides flows to the stream and river, turning into white silver chains, like thousands of dragons and snakes swimming. Returning from Nanquan, having cleansed my body and mind, and reduced the burden on my shoulders, I feel as if I am riding the wind, and I really don't know if there are any worries in the world, and I feel like I am about to become an immortal. The mountain city is beautiful; but only those of us who are unencumbered, uncontested, and unseeking can appreciate its beauty.</p>
<p>Here, I am afraid to hear the news coming from Jiangnan. Every piece of news is heart-shattering. We are floating water crows, and at night, we are all looking for our own homes by the Yangtze River. This river is like a long snake. You are at the "head of Wu", and we are at the "tail of Chu". Although there is a distance, it does not exceed the length of the snake's body. The head of Wu and the tail of Chu are closely related. I cannot forget Jiangnan, just as I care about my friends living in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Spring is coming, and spring brings hope and happiness to people. Here, I respectfully pray for my friends, may you be broad-minded and optimistic, and seek your own good fortune. How much is life, like morning dew, why bother to compete with each other bitterly? God in Heaven, as if foreseeing that mankind will always have a tragic ending, specially laid out a piece of brocade in the spring of every year for people to admire. May everyone cherish the good spring scenery and not live up to the generosity of nature.</p>
<h3>Mother's Trip</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>A fussy mother took five children on a train and kept asking the porter to take care of her children along the way.</p>
<p>As the trip was about to end, she asked the porter to hold the smallest one, who was crying desperately, while she took care of the other children. At this time, the porter was really a little impatient.</p>
<p>"Madam," the porter said, "I think when you come out to travel, you should leave half of your children at home."</p>
<p>The woman looked at him proudly and said, "That's what I did."</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Supervisor Qian Jingyu</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xiu</p>
<p>No such talent in Yue, the debate in Shanghai is most worthy of thought; in youth I remember urging you to open the book, in old age I met you and allowed you to talk about poetry. I regret missing the literary gathering on the Lantern Festival, and I am shocked by the fading appearance of a hundred years; now tears pour down like the East Sea, washing away the unknown of the catalpa coffin!</p>

<h3>British Literary Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Liam O’Flaherty, who was introduced and whose novels were translated by Yu Dafu, has recently published a new novel, "Land." This novel is quite close to farce, the story is lively and powerful.</p>
<p>Miss V. Sackville-West has recently published a collection of poems, "The Garden," which is poetic.</p>
<p>Last year, The House of Hutchinson published "Shaw at Ninety," a collective work with contributions from Sir Max Beerbohm, Lord Dunsany, L. Housman, Xiong Shiyi, Aldous Huxley, J. Masfield, H.G. Wells, and others. Wells had not yet passed away at that time. The book includes color illustrations, mostly from Shaw's own collection.</p>
<p>Miss Laura L. Hinkley of the United States received the California Literature Gold Medal for her book on past British female writers, "Charlotte and Emnlly, The Brontes," discussing their "Jane Eyre" and "Wuthering Heights." The latter was adapted into a play called "Endless Sorrow" by Ms. Zhao Qingge. The same author also wrote "Ladies of Literature," discussing many British female writers such as Austen, the Brontë sisters, Mrs. Browning, and Eliot.</p>
<p>Jamess Barke plans three novels about Robert Burns. This Scottish poet will be further revealed through Barke's narrative. In addition to knowing him as a farmer poet, we can also learn about his ancestors, the situation in 18th-century Scotland, and Burns's youth. Burns's father worked tirelessly, and the village teacher introduced literary works to Burns. His mother sang sweet folk songs to him, and old Betty Daoidson also told him stories and ballads, providing him with rich material. "The sweet tongue of the Scots flows with honey." All of this is recorded in the first volume of Barke's trilogy, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley."</p>
<h3>Blessing</h3>
<p>— Saint</p>
<p>——Written for a friend going to study in the United States</p>
<p>Throughout the long years of your life, although you have always lived a blissful petit bourgeois life, you are your parents' darling, the pride of the whole family; however, you certainly do not have the arrogance of a pampered young lady, nor have you picked up the bad habits of urban misses who are extravagant and frivolous. With this alone, you can be proud in front of millions of people. At the same time, the only manifestation of this pride is that today you are determined to temporarily abandon the blissful family life and resolutely embark on a journey across the ocean to seek further education. For your future, and to cultivate another talent for the country! I specially write this article to bless your future success.</p>
<p>Once, one evening, you told me many unexpected experiences, which made it impossible for me to describe my respect for you at that time; until now, it is still deeply imprinted in my heart, leaving behind eternal memories. Six years ago, just as the Pacific War broke out and the enemy entered the concession, you, only sixteen years old, disregarded everything and single-handedly threw yourself into the embrace of the motherland—going to Jinhua. This extraordinary spirit demonstrates your courage, a courage that not only is not possessed by girls in the same family environment as you, but even an ordinary boy would not easily do such a risky thing. Precisely because you are a girl, it shows your unparalleled tenacity. Therefore, today you can give up a life of pleasure and go to the United States, seeking loneliness and a monotonous atmosphere among strangers. I believe in your determination, I admire your perseverance. To encourage you and to increase your courage, I bless you with a boundless future and a bright path.</p>
<p>Now, the motherland is engulfed in flames of war, and the gospel of peace is so渺茫. In this city filled with the atmosphere of metallic vulgarity, an ordinary college student is not surprising. There is no place for you in society, nor the ideal environment you are pursuing. You are like a drop in the ocean, drifting with the waves, not knowing when you may be sunk by a giant wave. Therefore, you are a reject of society. In order to escape reality, you are keenly leaving this society; in a blink of an eye, you will leave the motherland, leave this bustling city, and cross the ocean alone to another new world, breathing that healthy air. I bless you a smooth journey, to return to the country after completing your studies as soon as possible, and to create a new world for you and for the motherland.</p>
<p>When you return, I hope that the motherland will no longer hear the sound of gunfire, nor smell the smell of gunpowder. The whole of China will be a peaceful paradise. I will wait for your return in front of the garden in paradise, waiting for you to play the symphony of peace. I bless you. I devoutly kneel before the Vatican and silently wish you success, blessing you to bring new seeds and new nourishment to cultivate your new life, your new future, and also to cultivate a new China.</p>

<h3>Cultural Exchange Among the People</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>In ancient times, political and military achievements paved the way for cultural transmission. For example, Alexander the Great of Greece conquered India, but Hellenism also declined. Napoleon invaded Moscow, but French culture became bleak. It can be seen that trying to oppress other people's lands and destroy other people's cultural relics with politics and force will only result in one's own national power declining, leaving behind some exaggerated forms for later generations to mourn. Only cultural exchange among the people and mutual assistance between people can eliminate the boundaries between different races and resolve international misunderstandings. Therefore, the League of Nations initially established a cultural cooperation organization, selecting social elites from various countries who did not represent their countries. The intention was to promote mutual friendship and assistance between people, promote mutual understanding, and reduce misunderstandings. Without political power, allowing cultural exchange can give hope for world peace and progress.</p>
<p>Now, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has changed its previous methods, with countries sending designated representatives to participate. Naturally, many cooperative effects can also be achieved, such as establishing nutrition center stations and literacy campaigns to eliminate illiteracy, all kinds of plans to seek welfare for mankind. But the power of mutual understanding and enthusiasm for mutual assistance are far less direct and profound than cultural exchange among the people. To help promote this kind of world cooperation movement, it is still necessary for social elites, academic experts, and people of high moral character to come forward to preside over and lead. Only when people and people are united firmly can progress be made. Zhang Boling returned from the United States, full of hope for China's rejuvenation. When asked what he would do in the future, he said that in addition to education work, he would also devote himself to the Sino-American Cultural Association. He earnestly said that cultural exchange among the people is more important than political diplomacy. This is indeed a visionary insight. In the future, the world may walk on this bright path to peace. A true cultural renaissance must be found through cooperation among the people of all countries to find what is fair and just. Today, in China, where the economy is chaotic and academia is barren, in addition to popularizing education and developing industry, we should especially pay attention to friendship and mutual assistance among the people.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 178</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>What is Pingzi's intention in revealing this information!? Yaoqun glanced at a few of us, stopping at Tsurumi's face, as if searching for some secret that Tsurumi had not revealed: "She and you..."?</p>
<p>Hearing Yaoqun's seemingly unfinished question, I, as a third party, suddenly felt like I had been electrocuted, and the blood vessels on my temples throbbed a little. The relationship between the three of them—Tsurumi, Yaoqun, and Pingzi—from beginning to end, only I knew most clearly.</p>
<p>People who are overly sensitive will definitely say when they see me writing the story here that the author must be pulling these one man and two women together to create a "love triangle" story that is popular now, to make the scene more lively. I am temporarily unwilling to express any opinions on such views, I only worry that people who look at this record with such eyes may feel even more disappointed in the future!</p>
<p>When I heard Yaoqun ask Tsurumi, I felt some surprise at the time, which was a kind of inexplicable unease for the straightforwardness of this northeastern girl Yaoqun and Tsurumi's awkwardness, without any other thoughts.</p>
<p>"Pingzi and I:" Tsurumi replied, "Now we maintain a delicate facade that is neither enemy nor friend. However, it cannot be said to be an 'enemy,' nor can it be said to be a 'friend.' In the face of the great era and great changes that are about to unfold before us, I can boldly say a word—the two words 'man' and 'woman' cannot, and should not, continue to carry the kind of 'sexual' characteristics in the eyes of ordinary society—this is because we are all fighters, and each person is a unit of a fighter. To put it more concretely, those with different goals must fight each other, and those with the same interests must work together, regardless of whether the other party is male or female. This is an iron law; an iron law generated in response to this great era!" Tsurumi's expression showed innocence, frankness, and sincerity.</p>
<p>"You misunderstood, Mr. Gu!" Yaoqun chuckled. "I remember I said this theory before you, remember?: What I want to understand now is whether Pingzi-san, this 'unit of a fighter,' has the same 'interests' as you, or the opposite, or seemingly the same but seemingly the opposite? On this point, do you have any solid certainty? Because I am worried about you now...worried about you, which is also worried about our group..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi was really embarrassed. People who are not very understanding may commit suicide by jumping into the river, hanging themselves, taking sleeping pills, or firing a shot at their temples or heart, or Japanese-style seppuku, jumping into a volcano; or Western-style cutting their veins, releasing gas, jumping from the thirteenth floor, swallowing potassium cyanide. How can one's good intentions be misinterpreted as a relationship between a man and a woman? And then give a long lecture?</p>
<p>I seemed to have to help Tsurumi out of this predicament, but at that time, a kind of indescribable insight flashed like lightning, which actually stopped me from speaking out. The rest included Little Huchen, who couldn't say a clever word to ease this low-pressure situation. Unfortunately, he didn't grasp the core of the sexual issue at all, and many theoretical professional terms made him dizzy. For example, the two words "fighter," in his half-knowledge, should probably be "gan shi," and "a unit of a fighter" should happily say "a ganzi," and so on. He sat here listening to us talk, like a country child listening to a group of fashionable college students discussing love issues, with how many unsuitable English words in a Chinese sentence. That would naturally make this country child confused. Therefore, Huchen was in such a "qie men" environment, not to mention that he couldn't say a clever word, even breathing was a little uncomfortable.</p>

<h3>Flower Market</h3>
<p>— Lu Shan</p>
<p>A Discussion of Nurseries, Flower Sheds, and the Flower Season</p>
<p>(1) Spring Arrives in the World</p>
<p>It's spring, but Shanghai is still shivering in the cold wind. — In this world-class metropolis, spring flowers will soon bloom on the chests of noble ladies; bloom in the magnificent street-side glass display windows; and be displayed in quiet studies. These brilliant, colorful flowers can prove that the winter in spring — this chilly winter wind — will not linger for too long.</p>
<p>Because those fragrant, sweet-smelling, and colorful flowers will soon wave and call the real spring to come. If you don't believe it, in the nurseries and glass sheds, all kinds of flowers have already sent out buds and sprouted green shoots, which will reveal their most moving colors and scents to express how moving the youthful appearance is.</p>
<p>(2) Artificial Cultivation</p>
<p>Shanghai, all year round — regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, for twelve months, fresh flowers never stop.</p>
<p>These flowers, whether it is autumn frost or dew, or white snow and ice, the most brightly colored flowers still bloom all over Shanghai, in the vases of dressing tables, and in magnificent living rooms. Most of these flowers are cultivated artificially, forced to bloom after a long period of smoking by florists in glass greenhouses.</p>
<p>Those carnations and lilies used for weddings, can't they be pinned on the chests of beautiful brides all year round? If it weren't for artificial cultivation, how could they have such a long lifespan?</p>
<p>(3) Flower Market Association</p>
<p>Most of Shanghai's flower markets are concentrated in Xieqiao in the Nanshi area, where there is a Flower Market Association. All the flowers from flower sheds throughout Shanghai are sent to the flower market in the middle of the night. The flower market's trading time is from 3:00 to 5:00 AM. Flower sellers and flower buyers all trade during this time. After this time, the flower market closes, and you have to wait until the next day.</p>
<p>The Flower Market Association also provides places to stay. Sellers from distant flower sheds can bring their flowers early and stay at the Flower Market Association. At a certain time, you can sell your flowers, and the association only charges a small fee.</p>
<p>(4) Flower Shed Areas</p>
<p>It is impossible to count all the flower sheds in Shanghai for the time being. Their distribution locations are roughly in Pudong, Nanshi, and Caohejing. The construction cost of a flower shed is estimated to be about four million yuan now, including glass and steam. Now, because it is not profitable to grow rice in the fields, having a glass flower shed is much more profitable.</p>
<p>Before every "Qingming Festival," all the fresh flowers in Shanghai are cultivated in glass sheds using high-temperature steam.</p>
<p>Those bright red and white carnations, yellow and purplish red roses, foreign willows, and lotus flowers that you often see on the streets... most of these are foreign varieties, and they are all illegally produced in artificial glass sheds. But aren't they just as dazzling and beautiful?</p>
<p>(5) Flower Season</p>
<p>The market price of flowers also changes with the seasons. For example, these past few days, the weather has been terribly cold, and the market price of flowers has increased by one-third. A dozen carnations sell for 12,000, and foreign willows sell for 7,000 or 8,000, 4,000 or 5,000 per bunch, and lilies sell for 120,000 a dozen...</p>
<p>If you have any banquet, as long as it meets the needs, you will never be stingy about buying some flowers to decorate it.</p>
<p>But if the weather really warms up, after the "Qingming Festival," when open-air flowers are on the market, those natural flowers that are not cultivated in glass sheds, when they really bloom all over the world, the prices of those artificially cultivated flowers will immediately fall.</p>
<p>That's when fresh flowers are truly democratized. You and I, who do not belong to the aristocratic class, can also decorate our vases with red and green.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? The real spring, that's when it truly arrives in the world.</p>
<h3>Talking About Long and Short Couplets — New Words on Couplets — Two —</h3>
<p>— Listening to Pine Trees</p>
<p>Yesterday, I wrote a couplet by Zhang Wenxiang. At the same time, Shen Meisou also mentioned a couplet: "When Chang Hubei created the Silver Yuan Bureau, Nanpi intended to write a long couplet outside the gate of the bureau, but he did not write it for a long time. The officials said that the bureau was about to be completed and needed to be applied urgently. Wenxiang had no choice but to order his staff to write it, but the draft was not satisfactory. One day, while hosting a banquet, he suddenly ordered the talents to quickly buy two wide red papers and write a couplet on the spot, saying: 'The state of Chu regarded it as a treasure, and nothing is better than the dragon for heaven.' The first line is an idiom, embedding the characters for 'state' and 'treasure', which is already rare and valuable. The second line quotes a sentence from Zhuangzi, which is accurate to the dragon round, and is even more complete and natural, and cleverly insurmountable." Meisou said: When he picked up the pen and wrote quickly, he looked around and said: If anyone can change a word in this couplet hanging on the bureau gate, I will also reward them with a thousand gold. His bold and unrestrained enthusiasm was unparalleled in the world. Now, more than ten years have passed, but it is still like yesterday. What is even more difficult is that the words are calm and composed, and the use of idioms is humorous and wonderful, which is even more unprecedented. My late father said: "Writing fearful couplets has flexibility, and writing short couplets, whether five-character or seven- or eight-character, is not easy to quote idioms. Even if you write your own, in a few words, there is a historical fact and ambition. Not only must it be all-encompassing, but also accurate and unchangeable. The identity and tone must be exactly as they should be, and the difficulty is really twice as difficult as writing a long couplet." Weng Changshu was also good at making couplets, and his door couplet, "Old steeds think of thousands of miles, wrens perch on a branch," which also used idioms, was also widely recited for a time. This old man was the same year as my late father, and their friendship was very deep. My late father's seventieth birthday, the seven-character couplet he gave said: "Yellow-haired old officials are the same as the nine old men, white-haired and young are like infants." The first line refers to Zhang Xiangshi's late Wen Duan Gong being seventy years old and attending the Jiu Lao Banquet. The second line is because my late father and late grandmother were born on the same day. Whenever this day came, he would always cry several times, unable to bear the banquet celebration. Changshu knew this situation very well, but the seventieth birthday could not be celebrated behind closed doors, so the wording of the second line completely covered this matter, which was more accurate than the first line, and the tone was great, and it also suited each other's identity. It was written on Qianlong imitation, Dengxin Hall warehouse yellow stationery, which can be said to be a masterpiece of words.</p>
<h3>Dialogue of Love</h3>
<p>— Kong Yuan</p>
<p>"Plato said, thank God, I am a man and not a woman. This sentence is clearly insulting to us women."</p>
<p>"Not at all. Plato hoped to become a strong person, because people often said: Weak person, your name is woman."</p>
<p>"Why did Kant never marry in his life? Did he advocate celibacy?"</p>
<p>"He wanted to get married very much. He wanted to propose to his girlfriend twice, but his hesitation and hesitation were the cause of his trouble. Once, he hesitated for too long. She couldn't wait for his decision and moved elsewhere. Once, he hesitated and couldn't decide, and she finally loved a man with courage."</p>
<p>"Do you advocate that a man should propose to his girlfriend quickly?"</p>
<p>"The word 'quickly' in your sentence is problematic. My advocacy is that you can't choose the person you want to love quickly. When you really choose, then you might as well tell her quickly that you love her."</p>
<h3>Collection of Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— Li Shui</p>
<p>A streetcar ticket seller asked another companion, he said: "Government employees are allocated in-kind benefits, do we count as government employees?"</p>
<p>Passengers and ticket sellers in streetcars and buses often scold each other loudly. One says: "Big shot, take the bus!" The other says: "At most, it's just a ticket seller, what's there to be proud of?" In fact, "we are all wanderers fallen from the ends of the earth," why bother pressing each other so hard?</p>
<p>Just after the spring break, children reach out to ask their parents for money to go to school. For parents, planning for school and meal expenses of four or five hundred thousand or a million has already made them add a few strands of "white hair." Have the children ever thought that in each of these bundles of paper money, there are so many worries and sorrows!</p>
<p>Since the introduction of transfer fees for houses, people who have no houses to live in have already regarded houses as half the sky. Now, after such a turbulent financial tide, houses have become vague clouds and fog, even more distant and impossible to grasp.</p>
<p>The threat of life makes everyone have a feeling of "melancholy." Living in these turbulent years, how should we deal with this rapidly changing space, it seems that we ourselves have lost the ability to control.</p>
<h3>Introducing "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," which is about to be released at the Cathay Theatre, is a best-selling novel published in 1943. The author is Betty Smith, originally named A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Translating it as "Chang Chun Shu" (Evergreen Tree) is really very appropriate to the content. The story is about the Nolans, a family in a slum in Brooklyn. Although this family (especially the father and daughter) is in a difficult situation, they still do not lose their hope, just like that tree in a dirty backyard, it can pierce the cement and grow into the air.</p>
<p>The director of "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is Elia Kazan. The leading actors are Peggy Ann Garner as Francie (daughter), Dorothy McGuire as Katie (mother), and James Dunn as Johnny (father). Life magazine introduced it as a best-selling novel made into a wonderful movie, worth watching.</p>
<p>Movie Talk</p>
<h3>"Each Has Their Own Merits"</h3>
<p>— Luo Lin</p>
<p>After the victory, domestic films are seeking new paths. In terms of subject matter, there are quite a few films based on stories from the war-time occupied areas, such as "Family of Loyalty and Righteousness," "Iron Will and Ice Heart," "Sugarcane Flowers Turn White, Swallows Fly," and the recent "Madame in Distress." However, because each film more or less committed the fault of conceptual depiction, the audience did not feel intimate with them. "Each Has Their Own Merits" took a different approach, becoming a portrayal of daily life, expressing the distance in thinking between mother and daughter through interesting details in life, and the disputes in the small family life after the daughter's marriage, etc.</p>
<p>The playwright wanted to place the theme on the so-called issue of women's education, but he could not make the decision himself. His pen had to touch on this turbulent reality, depicting the various sufferings people endure in real life. However, he did not unite the two; women's education, women's status in society, their professions and economic foundation, these issues are all raised, but we don't know at all what the playwright's subjective views are. He seems to be taking us around in circles. At the end of the film, the young couple Jin Bihua and Yang Cong, due to the difficulties of economic life, their fantasies are shattered. They have to endure a period of darkness before they can wait for the dawn. They still expect to live a comfortable life. This is a very weak ending. Jin Bihua and Yang Cong suffered some hardships and hit many snags, finally jumping out of a void and ethereal fantasy. Could it be that they are going to be made to dream an unrealistic dream again? I say, unlimited tears, of course, also have brilliance, but they more often express pessimism, disappointment, rather than being positive or striving.</p>
<p>From the perspective of theme expression, "Each Has Their Own Merits" also lacks completeness. However, the events in the story are familiar to us. On this point alone, it will be able to gain something. Director Zhu Shilin showed his unique talent in many fragments. Jin Bihua visited four past classmates after her marriage, inserting four fragments of depiction, without repetition, and also letting us open our eyes to see other family lives. From a holistic perspective, Zhu Shilin was also able to use economical conditions to make films and cover up the hasty places well.</p>
