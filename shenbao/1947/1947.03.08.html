<h3>日本賠償物資　約達一千萬噸　我國可獲百分之三十</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於日本賠償物質之數量，共有三種估計，最高為一千二百萬噸，决為九百萬噸，最低者爲七百萬噸。我國此次可能取得者，爲總數百分之三十。美國對此已表同意，聞　　亦不反對，但須經盟國對日委員會通過。目前問題在我國利用之能力</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京七日電〕資源委員會駐美代表兼駐日接收代表團團長惲震，近由日本返指此間，今日招待記者稱：遠東委員會已指定日本賠償盟國之全部物資，中國共可獲得百分之三十。依照總萊之初期賠償計劃，日本物資十三種，計一千萬噸，已留作賠償之用，其第一部份百分之三十即將連至中國，菲律濱，荷蘭及英國，中國獨得半數，其他三國合得半數。中國戰時損失不下三千萬美元，能否全部獲得賠償，須視日本經濟能力而定。關於賠償事件，美方熊度較澦料者為寬大。日本重工業尤其是軍火廠，早經拆除，運往其他盟國，作爲賠償。搬運賠償物資來華一節，央無問題，但所需費用則極感困難。日本機器如若運用得當，將大有助於中國之戰後復興。其中若干係購自德國，仍頗究好。飽萊所擬末期賠價計劃已吿完成，現已呈請杜魯門總統審核。盟國間意見分歧，致對賠償程序之順利執行，不無妨礙。</p>

<h3>計劃經濟案內容廣泛　主旨在繁榮農村　擬首自黃河流域區實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國防會六日例會中？曾討論通過實施計劃經濟一案。茲探悉，該案內容包括極爲廣泛，惟其主旨乃在就我國目前所須改進及配合我國現有環境所擬定之經濟方案。本報記者　特訪經次蕭錚，請解釋計劃經濟之意義及其實施辦法。據談，該案已決交全國經委會計劃施行。過去政府曾擬有五年經濟計劃，惟該項計劃乃係就國家一切均已返回平時之正常狀態下之一般理想。重工業各種設備，鈞計劃以外貨之機器為之，視今日一切尙在動亂中，自不能如理想要施，故有此方案之擬定。此案中心即在繁榮總村經濟，刺激工業建設，依照國父民生主義改良土地政策。就廣大農村以合作社方式，合併小農土地而為標準農塲，再進而至合作農楊，實行集體耕種，復以科學方法改良耕種技術，做到機器耕作，並興修水利，便利交通。同時農業建設所需採取定貨制度，向都市工廠定貨，則工業發展，生產不致呆滯，由是農村經濟繁榮　而工業亦可籍而發展。又該方案擬首自華北黃河流域綏靖區實施，從新收復區着手改良，然後響及全國。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>紀念婦女節的意義</h3>
<p>婦女節一年一度的來臨，一年一度的過去，所以對於本年婦女節的來臨，人們自有無限感慨。可是今年婦女節的來臨，特別對於我們中國人民，我們中國的婦女，卻有深長的意義。我們在此地，不必提起婦女的歷史，在今日婦女節的許多紀念場合，必然會有人提起它；我們所要指出的，就是對着婦女節的來到，我們特別要提高婦女們對政治的覺醒。</p>
<p>所謂婦女運動，實即是婦女參政運動，婦女參加選舉運動。此一運動本有其歷史的淵源，可是因為社會客觀條件的不成熟，此一運動直到二十世紀初葉纔開始抬頭，到了最近世界第二次大戰後，就是在近代民主政治的發祥地而同時也是女權最落後的法國，也有婦女參政之憲法的規定，可以說早期女權運動所希望的目的如今在政治法律上已多少一一實現了。在法國革命早期的所謂「藍襪子」之羣，如果看見今天在國家的立法機關裏，如莊嚴的國會，也有了婦女的代表，以及在國家的政府機關里，也有了女公務員，必將含笑。就是在我們中國，婦女參政也有了相當成果。在今日的國家最高立法監察機關裏均有女委員，在新近完成制憲任務的國民大會裏也有我們的女代表；且在我們的憲法及其它法律裏面，男女的地位均屬平等。所謂婦女解放運動，到此實不能不說有相當的收穫。</p>
<p>但我們覺得遺憾的是婦女在法律政治上取得的平等，不一定是社會地位的平等。而且觀乎各地政府晚近的若干設施，卻似乎在造成或加深婦女在社會上地位的惡化。民國以來，因為早期參加革命的還有不少女同志如秋瑾之類，所以除了外國勢力所及的租界和封建勢力特別濃　的地區以外，對於倡妓是向來懸為厲禁的；這是看重婦女在社會上的地位的原故。但在向來容許公倡存在，同時不許婦女參政的法國，也改變了作風准許婦女參政而禁絕公倡的今日，我們們卻看見各地政府在鼓勵提倡公倡。日本也是向來准許公倡的，如今在麥克阿瑟元帥的統治下，卻不許有像吉原那樣的遊廊。在女權落後的法國和日本已不許有公倡了，而我們在今日卻在提倡公倡，這不是開倒車是什麼？在今天我們還要再來提倡「慎男女之防」，這不是開倒車又是什麼？凡此，均是輕視婦女社會地位的表徵。今日當婦女節的來到，我們要提高我國的女同胞對於這些歧視女性舉施的警覺；他們所要力爭的不應該是國民大會或立法院的名額，倒是對於這些與婦女本身地位有關的歧視舉措。</p>
<p>今天我們在中國紀念這一個婦女節，竟義尤其深長。我們國家的根本大法已於去歲由國民大會製定了，今年將為行憲之年。二十世紀初華女權運動所爭的目的，如今在我們中國也已經達到。我們　全國婦女珍視這種收穫，以她們的全力來維護這部可寶貴的憲法。全國的女同胞以她們的行為維護這部憲法，說是今天紀念婦女節的最大意義。</p>
<h3>取締囤積抬價的程序</h3>
<p>經濟緊急措施方案共分六項，但其重點，實在抑平物價這一項。同時公佈的，還有（一）取締黃金買賣，（二）禁止外幣流通，（三）加強金融管制等三項，其直接和間接作用，也無非為抑平物價。</p>
<p>那未，抑平物價，究應採取何種手段呢？是否監視，嚴查，拘捕，法辦，就算了事呢？是否任何物價的管制，都適用這些手段？又是否無條件地適用這些手段？試一加研究，就不難發見有許多條件和限制，在法律的觀點上，不無考量餘地。</p>
<p>第一，方案（四）的第二條，載明：各指定地一切日用品，應嚴格議價，依照取締違反限價議價條例及評議物價實施方案辦理。這已民說明了（一）區域，（二）種類，（三）限度，和（四）一定的手續，必須遵守。同時又規定非常時期農礦工商管理條例和非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法，均應嚴格執行。按照取締違反限價　價條例第一條，所稱限價議價，除依國家總動員法第八條規定外，均以民生日用品為限。第二條并明定構成所謂違反的條件，第三·五兩條又指定主管這取締事項的機關，在院轄市為社會局，負責調查的為警察局。而如何處分，則歷舉在第六條內，是抑平物價所當遵由的途徑，本來規定得十分清楚。而且所謂評價，也不是漫無標準的。依照評議物價實施辦法，首先應當由行政行政院命令，設立物價評議會，次則由評議會議定應行議價：物品種類，由地方政府核定公告，次乃按照物品成本，分別酌加利潤，議定標準，再由政府公告施行。換句話說：在上述這些手續未經完成以前，尚無所謂議價與違反議價，更談不到如何處分。取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法第七，八，九等條，所有應行取締之區域，各類，名稱，亦有由經濟部令行地方主管官署，在轄境內，先行公告周知等規定。在未經公告以膠，所囤積之物品，無論是本業，或非本業，并準報明，限期出售。到期如果未能出售，且許由官署代為出售，或以公平價收買。那末，在未經依法議價，公告實施以前，縱使有囤積行為，也并不是沒有伸縮餘地。因為依照現行各項法令，應行予以取締的，明明指定是日用必需品，而且是重要必需品，執行是項取締工作的是社會局和警察局，應予查禁和處分的衹是違反議價而議價的審定工作，是屬於物價評議會，至評議會應否組織，應候行政院指定，核定和公佈是項議價的是社會局，在未經公佈前所囤積的物品并準予限期自行出售，或呈請收買。所以這些法令，雖說多半是非當時期所頒行，亦可稱條理井然，層次分明，且對於法理人情，未嘗不面面顧到。</p>
<p>自從緊急措施方案頒佈以來，抑平物價這工作，已在積極展開，少數囤商，并已落入法網。在他們投機囤積，抬高物價，原屬咎由自取，但法律上的程式尚未完成以前，在他們也恐怕還有一部分莫名其妙，更不知道，怎樣採取合法的途徑以養補救，這到底也是一件可以稱為遺憾的事。</p>
<p>照中央頒佈的這些法令，所謂抑平物價，更不是一件純粹消極的事。例如民生日用品必需物品供應辦法實施細則第六條規定：政府於必要時，出售物品，調劑市場，各該業應需資金，原料，動力，及運輸發生困難時，得請政府予以協助。其非常農礦工商管理條例第四，五，七，八，十七，廿一，廿五等條，經濟部對於特定之企業或物品，除掉規定標準，督促改進以外，在必要時，并應投資，協助，收買，代管，或竟收歸國有，直接經營，這完全屬積極的性質。良以抑平物價，端在增進生產，斷非單純的取締，限制，配售，和罰辦所能生效。所以真要抑平物價，在治本與治標兩方面，必須同時進行。</p>
<p>現在治標方面，已在紛紛發動了。治本方面，究應如何着手，似乎還沒有注意到。付諸實施。我們明知道：上述那些法令，多半是戰時性質，有好許多地方，未必切於實用。但是可以實施的也并不少。倘單把屬於取締和限制的部分引用了，卻把扶助和促進的部分，完全不顧，那未免斷章取義，過於偏頗。尤其是屬於取締的準備工作，也還沒有完成，好像單靠幾名警察，就可以把物價抑平下去的。如果真能如此容易，那末投機，抬價，囤積，居奇的風氣，似乎早已不會存留到現在！</p>

<h3>馬歇爾飛莫斯科　貝文皮杜爾專車抵蘇邊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎七日廣播：美國務鄉馬歇爾今晨十一時（即上海時閱下午七時）親臨無名英雄墓致敬，旋於下午一時（上海時間下午九時）飛離巴黎前赴柏林，將與美軍佔領當局會　後，然後再飛赴莫斯科。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎七日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾，昨途經此間，與法總統歐體和及總理賴瑪迪進行會談，檢討美法二國間之友好歷史關係，但當亦交換關於對德和的之意見，例如設立德國聯邦，魯爾區在經濟上與德國分離，及萊茵區機於盟國佔領當局管理下等事，當曾提出討倫。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林七日電〕法國外長皮杜爾及其僚屬一行，昨夜七時乘坐火車離此赴莫斯科，英外相貝文事前乘坐另一專車赴蘇，貝氏於道出華沙時，向報界發表簡短談話稱，本人希望四外長會議解決德國問題能獲得成功，余若不懷有此種希望，則余亦不致長途跋涉能往莫斯科矣。德國問題迄未由四强加以討論，僅英法雙方最近舉行會談時，曾就此一間題互相交換意見，至於波蘭之西陲邊界問題，則在四外長會議未予討論之前，余對此未使發表任何意見。貝文外相在華沙逗留歷一小時之久，旋即乘事前往莫斯科，計程離蘇聯邊界已不號矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科六日電〕際茲外賓開始蒞臨出席四國外長會議之時，此間今日忽降暴雪，嚴重程度爲冬令以來所僅見，氣溫降至五度。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科七日專電〕莫斯科當局今已準備招待來此開會之各國代表，四家最佳之旅館重予油飾，特別指定之房問打掃一新，地氈　　均予更換，燈架及門柄均經磨光，各種玻璃飾物亦予洗刷，電梯司機發與嶄新制服，袖領均鑲以銀邊，各旅社並備有英語譯員多人。政府撥與車輛供各國代表乘用。首批記者攝影人員已到運，次批將於今明兩日抵此。英記者共二十人，美記者共卅六人。貝文將乘火車自加萊經柏林華沙至布勒斯特里多夫斯克，然後自該地換乘蘇聯火車，而與前往該地迎迓之英駐蘇大使同來莫斯科。</p>
<h3>外長會議程檢討　對德地位疆界必將引起爭執　區域安全公約亦在討論之列</h3>
<p>〔洗國新開社柏林七日電〕此間政治觀察家頃談稱：來日莫斯科四外長會議時，僅奧地利問題有最後解決之充分凖備。此次會議議程可以分為三大類，即（一）修正目前佔領德國之組織；（二）在條約內闡明德國之將來地位；（三）草擬恢復奧獨立之條約。最後一項問題雖可望莫期科會議加以解決，但其中包括保障奧獨立及奧境內之德財產問題在內，其意義之重要自不待言·以言保障奧獨立，其唯一有效辦法，除由奧簽訂此項宣言外，和約其他簽字國亦需同予保障，法國對此已主張應予以附加保陣，勿使重演一九三八年時之事態。英國態度則較為保留，不願捲入大陸的束之中，惟希望奧地利與多瑙河各國能在經濟上聯繫。蘇聯則仍反對加以保障，認為聯合國憲章之保證於事已足，蘇聯出此熊度，殆因有損於南斯拉夫對卡倫齊亞之要求所致。</p>
<p>其次，德國在奧境內之財產問題，其定義確尙待加以決定，例如德奧合併後奧地利所被沒收之財產是否亦應歸入此類，英美法三國皆以為蘇聯所提議之肅淸納粹計劃，已足以剝奪奧地利恢復經濟實力所必要之財產。關於德國目前與將來之地位，四國則尙在接洽階段，故莫斯科會議當不致即能奠下和的之基礎。其將來政治地位及疆界問題，勢將成為冗長辯論之主題，且有阻撓談判進行之可能，甚至佔領國之管理德國，消滅納粹份子，德國經濟與財政機構及設立中央政府等問題，亦將引起意見上之爭執。例如賠償問題，蘇聯欲勒取德國之所有，而英美則欲在實行賠價計劃之前，先恢復其經濟力量，减低佔領軍錢，雙方意見懸殊，以上問題似非輕易所能解決。另番，英外相貝文與美國務卿馬歇爾在莫斯科會議，聞將乘便與蘇聯進行談判，討論各大國在歐亞太平洋等地勢力範圍之臨時協定及區域安全公約等等，例如英法地二國最近所訂之間盟條約，此約或可擴大成為四國公約。</p>
<h3>和約不公　拒不簽字</h3>
<p>德社民黨領袖之言</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬七日電〕德國社會民主黨領袖施瑪契，頃在此間向義大利「時報」發表談話稱，倘對德和約所定之條款過於苛刻，則余將拒絕簽字，　德國亦與其他國家相同，不願目殺故也。若干德國國家主義者現仍在夢想納粹式之「大德國」，一輩滙和份子則希望恢復一九三七年之　界，但具有國家常踐之人則希望東西疆界能使德國生存，於願已足。以言最後改變領土事，則以合併土地為最惡劣之賠價方法，據國願付賠款，但首徐醫活其創傷。德國現惟希望能獲准參加莫斯科會議共商和約，待成立總國中央政府代表自由選舉之國會後，始能簽訂該項和約云。</p>

<h3>聯總結束以後　世界救濟工作展望</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>美國現正計劃一種國際救濟新方案，它足以加强英美對蘇聯在南歐方面爭奪戰的力量。美國的糧食和其他救濟品只能給與能够證明它們確實需要的友好國家。一九四七年份的美國救濟品大部分將運往義大利，奧地利和希臘。在聯合國救濟善後總署結束以後，凡是擁有大量軍隊或利用糧食作為政治武器的政府，不能再得到美國的援助了</p>
<p>美國此項新政策將予蘇聯及其衛星國以重大的打擊。這幾個國家在復興和建設方面已經得到聯總的援助，計值十四億六千萬美元，約佔聯總全部預算三分之一强。現在這滔滔洪流要節縮成涓滴細流了。所有蘇聯勢力範圍內的大多數國家，就連這涓滴之流，也不能分享一杯羹了。</p>
<p>在美國新政策的背後存在着一個矛盾：聯總救濟品中百分之七十二是由美國供給的，可是美國在聯總中央委員會中祗有一票權力，該委員會由九國組成，有分配救濟品之權。英，美，加拿大三國所供給的救濟物資佔百分之九十五，而三國表決權則祗有三分之一。</p>
<p>去年夏間美國飛機在南斯拉夫境內被迫降落，引起國內輿情騷然，而美國在此時期內仍不得不以救濟品及機器運往南斯拉夫，就是由於這一個矛盾事實。在阿爾巴尼亞也有類似的事情發生：阿國在射擊英國船襤，驅逐美國外交使節時，仍不斷獲得聯總的接濟。</p>
<p>今後救濟工作　各國直接交涉</p>
<p>一九四七年世界救淸工作的處理方式是不同了。聯總結束以後，救濟工作將建立於國與國單獨進行的基礎上，聯合國機構社能協助調查事實和作為磋商的媒介；這就是說，援助國和受援助國將直接談判，聯合國機構僅負諮詢及供給情報之責。</p>
<p>聯合國大會經濟金融委員會已設置一個由十個國家組成的專門委員會，決定那幾個國家需要援助，需要多少援助，和需要的東西是什麼。委員會的報吿送交聯合國各會員國，然後由它們自行磋商怎樣實施救濟計劃。</p>
<p>聯總已經分配給十五個國家的救濟物資和機器設備，的值美金三億四千萬元，即將陸續遝出，以資結束。聯總希望在三月底結束運往歐洲的物資，六月底結束運往東方的物資。此後它便關門大吉了。</p>
<p>聯總中央委員會末次會議決議接受美國建議，將最後一批的教濟品的分配加以調整，務使最需要的國家在最需要的時候獲得該項救濟品。所有聯總目前的各項任務，除糧食供應以外，將由　屬於聯合國的若干機構分別担任。難民救濟工作將由在組織中的國際難民機構担負；農業復興工作將由糧食農業機構辦理；疾病扶助事項將由世界衛生機構處理；福利工作將由　　社會委員會辦理。工業復興非當務之急，留待各國自行處理。各國需要額外援助時，可向世界銀行請求援助。</p>
<p>美國正謀撙節　撥款尚需時日</p>
<p>負責救濟工作者鑒於聯總匆匆結束，而新的機構遲濕進行，深恐杯水車薪，緩不濟急。這個問題須由美國國會來答復。美國務院並無經費供救濟他國之用，不得不需求國會撥款應用。一九四七年歐洲所需要的救濟品總數估計美金四億元，美國務院要求國會發付的款項恐不會超過半數，其餘數還得鼓勵其他各國（主要為加拿大及英國）來補足它。（譯者按：杜魯門總統已咨請國會撥款美金三億五千萬元以救濟各解放國家。）</p>
<p>美國會正在實行撙節，恐怕不願意美國再化費領于額金錢以救濟他國。此外，國會能否趕快辦到，也成問題。今後幾個月是最嚴州重的時期。這問題在國會中提出討論需要想當時日，將救濟品運交各國，需要更長的時期。</p>
<p>美國官方深知救濟工作不免遲遲進行，承認在一九四七年春季來臨以前，各國很少希望得到美政府的直接救助。在此靑黃不接時期，美國只好寄託希望於其他國家和聯總的最後一批救濟品了。主張美國撥付鉅款作為一九四七年國外救濟金者，或許會得到美國農民的同情，他們担心着堆積如山的過剩農產品會抑低價格，而造成穀賤傷農的局面。</p>
<p>一九四六年美國農業產量打破以往紀錄。除非一九四七年能保持大量的出口，則美國的農產品將發生過剩，足以影響農民目前豐裕的收入。取聯總而代之的新教濟計劃，是美國國務院的勝利，至少是前聯總署長賴伽第亞的局部失敗。</p>
<p>蘇聯及其與國救濟勢將停止</p>
<p>賴伽第亞主張救濟工作必須置於國際管制之下，以防救助國有徇私行為。美國務院的答復是：決無徇私行為，對擁有大量軍隊並利用工廠製造軍器的國家，決不以糧食接濟。這顯然是指蘇聯及其衛星國。</p>
<p>新救濟計劃是一種折衷辦法。關於那幾個國家需要救濟的問題讓十國（包括蘇聯在內）專門委員會去決定，但美國並不受該委員會建議的拘束。</p>
<p>一九四七年美國救濟品將給與那幾個國家，大體已經內定。美國院已經表示過，義奧兩國將為獲得華國救濟品的主要國家，希臘輪到第三個國家。波蘭和匃牙利亦可得到若干援助。對於阿爾巴尼亞·南斯拉夫及蘇聯等國，根據新政策大概將停運救濟品。</p>
<p>在今後六個月內，世界救濟工作將遭遇最大的艱難。過此時期，一九四七年的收獲可賣接濟，茍延殘喘。至一九四八年，各國政府可能完全放棄國際救濟，而讓私人機關去辦理救濟工作。（譯自「世界報吿週刋」）</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕反對黨領袖邱吉爾在下院印度政策辯論之第二日發言，建議將印度問題即向聯合國機構提出，請其解決。邱翁謂，政府之印度政策旣已失敗，就情理言，並為榮譽計，豈非應請更廣大的機構協助。邱氏指尼赫魯領導的印度政府為一完全不常的政府，以印度政府交付尼赫魯，實為一大錯誤。邱吉爾對於政府之未能說明召回印督華維爾之理由，表示遺憾。又指印度之政黨不能代表民衆，將印度政府交給此種所謂政治階級，不啻將政權移交草人，不數年後將無影踪可導。</p>
<p>英相答辯　調侃邱翁</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕下議員舉行印度政策辯論時，艾　禮首相代表政府答覆辯論，表示渠對印度未來發展如何，雖不能預測，然覺邱吉爾對於印度問題的經騐，實已落伍五十年之久。關於規定限期將政權交還印人之決議，渠承認此一期限確甚短促，然根據來自印度之警吿，實以確定期限為宜。</p>

<h3>魯易士蔑視法令罪　最高法院維持原判</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕美國最高法院今日以七票對二票，判決礦工聯合會主席魯易十去年十一月拒絕接受聯邦地方法院制止煤礦罷工侖令：犯有蔑視法令之罪屬實。此項判決乃社魯門總統　魯易士及工會鬥爭之絕大勝利。最高法院並批准魯易士罰　一萬元之原判，但對工會罰緩則自三西五十萬元　至七十萬元，惟工會如實行魯易士之威脅，於四月一日罷工，則二百八十萬元着額仍將照罰。院長文生於宣判時措辭堅決，略謂魯易十蔑視地方法院命令，係川於故意。工會此種能度威脅立黨政府與全國福利，故有罰以巨款之必要，以示蔑視法令罰行之嚴重。　易士聞判，並無意見發表，但此案並未了結。聯邦法官高爾斯勃　對於魯易士是否有權廢止工會與政府之工資合同一點，仍將舉行審判，此項審判因等待最高法院之判決，延擱至今。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第二次大會，於昨日上午九時半在塘沽踏新址繼續舉行第九次會議，出席參議員上午一百零五人，下午九十六人，市長墍市府各局局長等均列席。議程原定上午討論未決案件，下午第十次會議討論市政建設捐應吾征收問題，　以昨日討論有關法規，地政，社會，　政，民政，財政，公用，工務，衛生各項提案甚多，建設捐問題及其他臨時動議等，延待今日大會討論。大會會塲佈置在四樓，新經油漆，朱碧燦斕，倍形壯麗。九時正，由潘議長宣佈開會，共計通過議案十九件，撤銷議案兩件。會議過程中，以房屋租賃及議便問題最受注意，辯論熱烈。市長及各局局長等一再起立解釋，空氣極度緊張。下午延長會議一小時，至六時散會。</p>
<p>關於房屋和賃糾紛問題，昨日大會提出議案二件，一為「請市府維持參議會第一次大會議決案，明令全市房東不得隨便加租，以維平民生計，並對房捐部份，房東不得拒絕扣除，請公決送市府切實施行」。一為「請建議司法機關對房屋租賃加以維護，以解房荒，而安社會安寗」。</p>
<p>費樹聲以第二案之審查意見「房屋租賃委員會業經撤銷，本案礙難辦理」為不妥當。緣房荒嚴重性至今未滅，一般被配到房屋之公敎人員，因未付金條頂費而時遭迫遷，向法院訴訟，法院不唯不加保護，且對租戶困苦視若無覩。本會雖無權過問司法機關，但希望站在市民立塲，去函請法院維護租戶，勿偏袒榮主。姜屏落則謂，一般房東對於房客亦無辦法可應付。潘議長稱，可建議司法機關，注意本市房荒情形，對審理房屋糾紛案件時，特別注意本市之租賃習慣。</p>
<p>繼由吳市長表示意見稱：許多房屋里弄骯臟不堪，因房租不加，房東無力負擔修理費。若加租又增加房客負擔，故兩方面都困難。市府考慮結果，僅能使新蓋房屋不受房租限制，以獎勵造屋。此外會請中信局撥款二百億建造房屋，但無結果。經濟及物價不安定，要求合理解決實屬困難，然如體格處理，又將成為死城。市參議會雖可建議法院，但法院在依法辦理外，不能另有那幫助。然業主採用頂費方法，確應嚴格取締。如何可合理解決，請市參議會共商之。</p>
<p>該案於下午復與第一案合併討論。結果決交社會，法親，地政三委員會聯席會議討諭審查，聯席會日期排定後，可由各參議員參加討論。</p>
<p>列席參議會之市府各局首長，自右起，胡文元，谷春帆，張維，祝平，趙祖康。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>銀樓業等　請願五起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議會昨日舉行大會時，又有請願者數起：（一）銀樓業二十餘入，於下午赴會請願，對政府二月二十日頒布之金飾處理辦法：「限令一週內將已製成之金飾登記，並限於三月內出售，否則須向當地中央銀行或其委託銀行兌換國幣」，要求修正。當由嚴諤聲朱亞挨兩參議員接見，允予提付討論後轉呈市府及行政院。</p>
<p>又徐寄慶姜屏藩等四十八人臨時提議；請財政部迅速修正金飾處理辦法，以維銀樓業務而全職工生計案。略謂，本市銀樓業共二百五十家，職工不下數十萬人，生計將瀕絕境，政府迄今無　補辦法，似非體恤商艱顧全民生之意，故擬請財部明令廢止金飾處理辦法中之限期登記，限期出會，並兌換辦法中取具委託書之規定。並請財部在不妨礙經濟緊急處理辦法原則下，酌量放寬銀樓營業範圍，其法規有重大更迭者，須事先徽詢銀樓業意見。此外尙有（二）馬車業職工全體發表請願書，要求在中區恢復馬車行駛，以减輕電車擁擠程度及解決事夫生活。（三）人力車同業工會為市府徵收養路費表示反對。（四）自費留學生要求外匯按三三五〇計算。（五）酒菜業對要求筵席稅起稅點，適用於麵點與音樂設備之菜館</p>
<h3>指數問題　今日討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議員水祥雲等，爲顧及職工生活起見，建議請中央於四月份起，將工人生活指數解凍。但據記者昨日向市府有關人員探詢，據吿此事恐難實現。本市工人方面對於新訂增發七萬三千元差額貼補大致表示滿意，故此時立即要求改變決策，頗難辦到·但此案究竟如何解決，今日大會中將提出討論。</p>
<h3>設置南市碼頭倉庫區案　決請兩局先行詳細規劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議會昨日討論提案中，關於「復興南市發展港務，擬請設置「南市碼頭倉庫區」，以期促進繁榮便利航運案」，亦由各參議員紛紛提出意見。首由公用局長趙曾玨說明：碼頭與倉庫實應相連，俾便於卸貨掇運，原意非常正確。將來擬以電車軌道搬入裏馬路，外馬路則為倉庫區，即可有助繁榮。浦東亦將依照是項原則規劃。現擬先從南市着手之原因，乃欲先做成一模範。</p>
<p>瞿鉞對此表示反對，據稱：如沿浦建設倉庫區，則該處即成為死地，故欲劃取倉庫，應在南碼頭以內如半淞國一帶，否則將鎖住南市市面，電車亦無恢復希望。楊管北稱：倉庫區並非把已有商店取消之謂，而乃將原有碼頭擴大之謂。南市乃天然倉庫區，商店則均在裏馬路。南市碼頭如不加整理，則永不能發達，商店亦不會增設。王柄權又座倒楊管北，謂南市建設碼頭倉庫區，不易辦到，糾紛必多，不如請該處軍事機關遷讓改造。最後大會附議議長意見：「本案請工務·公用兩局詳細規劃後，交工務·公用聯席會議審核提第三次大會討論」。</p>
<h3>今日「三八」節　兩處慶祝大會</h3>

<h3>哈同花園　家廟失愼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今晨零時三分，靜安寺路九二六號哈同花園內之家廟，發生火警，經消防處派車到塲灌救後，歷時三刻鐘，即吿撲滅，僅焚燬廟宇一角。該家廟係哈同夫人生前每日焚香之所，住有僧人數名，自夫人去世後，即乏人照料，廟內凌亂不堪，是近並堆置雜物甚多，昨晚該廟香火因煮飯不愼，遺落火星，幾致釀成鉅災。</p>
<h3>清除糞便　招商承辦　市府自辦管理難週　不如商包反多收入</h3>
<p>昨日參議會二次大會討論提案頗多，最後討論處理糞便問題，引起一塲舌戰。衛生局長張維在二月前大會席上，會為垃圾車營私舞弊一案，受盡參議員責難，不幸昨為糞便問題，又成衆矢之的。</p>
<p>因參會衛生委員會審查市府送函一為本市清除糞便攬招商承辦」一案，昨日提交大會討論。鹿京周主張淸除糞便，採取招商承辦，因為一方面有利衛生管理，一方面可增加市庫收益。瞿　對此表示同意，但姜懷素·姜豪·王乃徐·張中原·路式導等則表示異議，均主張廳由市府自辦。何必要由商辦而任其營利剝削，把糞便視同黃金萬兩」。結果要請張局長報告所以要招商承辦之道理。張局長之解釋，謂此事在清道清潔委員會中曾討論十次，結果總覺招商承辦較自辦經濟·衛生·妥善。本人在原則上亦贊成自辦，但不倫自辦，招商辦，均應採用「去疫發酵堆肥」方法，然若市府辦理此一機構，至少須費二千億元，為市府目前所不能辦到。至於交招商承辦，則市府每月收入最低為三千三百萬，最高達四億六千萬元。現局方擬就與商訂合同草案，其中亦指明應採用「去疫·發酵·堆肥」之科學方法。最近擬請　塲糞便專家指導辦理此項新設施，但是否能有商入大量投費，不能保證，參議員能有妥善辦法決定，則局方自當盡其最大努力。</p>
<p>王劍鍔起而表示，略謂淸潔問題固重要，但現在尙不知招商承辦利弊究竟，故在未明眞相前，主張交市府主管機關詳　研究其中情形及辦法復再對論。</p>
<p>至此吳市長登台發言，謂自辭請除糞便一點。本人固亦贊同，但因過去會經研究甚久，發現頗多缺點，目前又無補救辦法，經淸道淸潔會商討後，仍主張招商承辦，但為感到總有不盡善之處，故請大會公決。至市府之不能達到自辦之理由有二：（一）人員所得待遇太低，即無法加强管理，致糞車漏了也不管，裝運麻煩，即倒入陰蔣，雖經調查處罰亦無用。（二）如市府自辦，目前弊端較包商允多，包商管理則視涓滴如黃金，情除週到，此外招商承辦後，市府收入亦多。</p>
<p>最後，潘議長表示：淸除黃便，原為市府自辦，並未由參議會通過，現在市府欲改為商辦，即自行變更其已定辦法。今可先付表決·結果贊成市府改變現行辦法者佔多數（即由市府招商承辦）。至此對於如何招商承辦，又引起許多不同之主張，而並無結果，最後僅通過「招商承辦」此一原則。</p>
<h3>糧貸案三次開審　徐寄廎奚玉書兩證人因事未到　檢察官請注意被告中有無可救</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧貸案昨長地院第三次開庭，所傳之證人徐寄廣，奚玉書因市參議會開會未到，檢察官之論吿，略謂：本案八被吿中如有觸犯普通刑事條例而適合大赦者，請審判長注意，而變更起訴條文。惟對第一被吿王巽之，曾在渝任國庫副庫長時洩漏黃金秘密，與第一次金潮有關，又於在杭州任烟草專賣局長任內，亦有凟職貪污行為，且犯罪方法巧妙，請庭長特別注意。又謂：糧官注達人，任星崖，身為糧貸之主管人員，而對案中重大事節非推諉於上級部令，即卸責於糧商，請審判長依法嚴懲。</p>
<p>被吿王巽之，莊漢章，吳蓉生，萬墨林，邢志剛，楊潤　，汪達人，任星崖八人所供與前二庭大致均同。傳訊證人邵季高，亦無甚新發現。王巽之對檢察官之論吿曾有所辯正，略稱：重慶金潮，係發生於民國三十三年，而彼早於三十二年七月離國庫副庫長之職，專賣局案，亦經查明係誤會云。</p>
<p>最後王巽之，莊漢章，吳蓉生，注達人之辯護律師紛起請求將被吿交保，當經合議裁定仍予駁回，論還押。</p>

<p>以剩餘棉紗易取港匯　每月供售二千件　政府決以各廠產紗十分之一外銷　　〔本報訊〕關係方面近爲香港政府要求我政府准予對港輸出棉紗，並　紡管會准予售給棉紗事，曾赴港　洽一過，業已與港政府簽立台同，每月由我暫先供售二千件。第一批二千件，業於日前啓運。據悉：港政府與我成交之紗價，以其支　準紗每件之上　交貨價港幣一千五百元為準。其他支數，照比例推算。至各種棉紗牌號，由我酌配，港政府不得選擇。港政府對所購得之棉紗，且須担保不得用於走私及擾亂紗市之途。據香港複製業方面估計，香港月需棉紗為五千件至一萬件。惟實際需要，不致超過四千件。按香港在經濟上，本寄託於我。且港地複製業，多屬僑胞所經營。故對港地輸出棉紗，亦寓有扶助僑胞之意。港政府以港地棉紗短絀，前會向日訂購棉紗，業於本年一月份裝到二批，計一萬一千件。該批日貨之廿支標準紗，在神交交貨價，每件僞港幣一千二百元。抵港後由港政府以每件港幣一千六百元之價格，配售予複製業。今華紗抵滬，亦將以同價配售。據悉：政府爲獲取外匯計，曾決定以上海各紗版產紗總量十分之一，供給外銷。估計本年我國輸出紗布，及其他棉織品之總值，約可換取外匯七千五百萬美元。此　爲紡織業對我國外匯資源之一大貢獻云。　　〔合衆社香港七日電〕香港工商部七日宣稱，該部已向中國紡織公司定購棉紗二十萬包，不久即可運抵香港。此項棉紗當以富優售與此間各紡織廠。據稱：該部已與中國政府訂立一六個月之合同·似尙未決定下决定購之日期。此次為戰爭以來第一次向中國購買大批棉紗。各行局所收儲蓄存款　准投資購買投票　並准以股票繳充存款保證　　交通銀行總處前呈請財政部，以各行局所收儲蓄存款，是否可投資購買上海證券交易所上市股票，並將該項股票繳充儲蓄存款保證準備，茲悉交行頃奉財政部函，略以各行局以折收儲蓄存款投贊購買上海證券交易所上市之股票，核與儲蓄銀行法第七條第一項及節約　國儲蓄條例第五條之規定尙屬相符，自可照辦，惟仍顧依照儲蓄銀行法第八條第一項之規定辦理，至上項股票繳充儲蓄存款保證準備一節，核與儲蓄銀行法第九條之規定亦無不合，其價格應照繳存時之市價五折計算，並經報請四聯總處理事會議核准，交行奉准後，已通函各行局知照云。外股不脫盤局　　外股昨初低後回，不脫盤旋，橡皮股仍由猶太商吸收，成父仍旺，會德監堅定逾恒，怡紗低價一八〇〇〇元，高價一九四〇〇元升而後有盤，結果較前收計鋼業橡皮股平平，餘者微升迄，半成弱不等。債市漸趨穩定　　公債昨仍無普遍性之交易做開，人心已漸穩定，低後漸高，甲乙自五二〇〇元，丙種自七七〇〇元，丁自五六〇〇元，統戊自五八〇〇元起，都以高價買盤結束，結果各較前收回好五百元上下，成交不過數十萬元。紗市成交少　　昨日紗市交稀價平，客帮迄無動靜，本有下跌可能。然目下因紗值僅合紗廠成本，紗廠旣不願多賣，紡建配售每家亦只一二件。業中人因補進不易，亦不願廉售，以致市價形成僵持之局，市塲上成交不多大半皆能恪守限歐。　　又訊，中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗共售一四二一件，內紗廠一〇七〇件，號家三五一件，申請共一〇一一戶，內紗廠七〇四戶，號家三〇七戶。複製業申購棉紗　以自身所需爲限　　〔本報訊〕紡管會頃函復製業公會：　該業嗣後中購棉紗，應以自身所需者為限。如申購非自身所需之紗，則非但不予配售，且申購者將犯有囤積之嫌疑。又嗣後該業所領購之紗，不得再向市塲拋售，發現時即將行糾舉。棉布求脫者多　價格較目日軋小　　昨日棉布市况，晨初以經監團監視嚴密，人心甚慮，執貨者多心慌求脫。十二磅龍頭細布開價十五萬九千元，降至十五萬六千元。後聞華製染織廠對二十支特細布頻有靑　，業中有人逢低吸進，故龍頭細布最後高至十五萬八千元，較上日軋小二千元。五福做十五萬四千元，藍雞十五萬二千元，軋小二三四千元。漂布客路不動，平定，色布士林布，俱見穩定。人造絲價回高　　人造絲昨又反動回高，因綢廠商配售絲不敷應用，紛向黑市吸收，以致喊價抬高。一二〇號高山有光最大喊到七百四十萬元，上午三十萬元收據，下午做二十萬元，結果比上日大三十萬元。廠絲市况清寂，毫無成交。干經昨美亞綢廠進十祖，價做五百六十五萬至七十萬元。綢貨因實銷淸淡，昨市大都疲落。大誠被面賣出喊三百八十萬元，格子　　喊一萬七千元，並無成交，塲內情異常寂寞。我國出口茶葉　品質務必優良　　昨據某茶葉出口商談：在國際市塲，佔有重要地位之葉茶，自勝利迄今，雖將屆二載，但因國內外售價懸殊不一，致出口並不蟬聯。而近年來所　出者，大都係一部份多年之陳茶，取其價格較　，惟目前海外屢次來電，談及裝抵彼地之華茶，除少數品質優良者，現已銷盡外，餘則因霉味奇重，故依然擱置。綜觀此種情形，嗣後我國茶商如再不憬悟，在國際間攸久之茶葉信譽，恐將逐漸喪失矣。　　外銷綠茶活躍　　昨內銷茶市，仍若冬眠狀態，市勢平定。至於洋莊交易，珍眉·針眉等綠茶，依然活躍不衰，行情一致站住。午昌茶葉公司及華茶公司，對於價格相宜者，咸抱來者不拒之勢。此外英莊注意之紅茶，一般亟求頭寸之貨主，雖仍在相率售出中，但進購者大刀闊斧，斬割益甚，賣戶究屬成本攸關，不忍過份貶脫，雙方商談結果，復入相替局面，市情淸寂。粳米售價績挫　油市去胃甚爽　　昨米市南北共到一萬零八百餘石，店方門消淸懈，市場供多於求。粳米呆滯之極，竟少受主，南北粳均一致續挫一二千元。白元陰元趨勢平定，秈米平穩之勢　　麺粉消化冷談，步落三五百元，鈇皮績疲三五百元，形勢仍趨疲軟。豆餅汕頭略動，繼續徵升三五百元。黃豆去化活終，　漲千元。　　油市配油共計豆油七百担，發配滬市郊區反浦東區，共二百四十一家，價二十五萬元，惟市勢因店銷甚殷，去　甚爽，生油再加六七千元，淸油同漲萬元，蔴油亦提三五千元。　　綠豆走消見解，下降三五千元，赤豆見疲一二千元，南洋動向不旺。苞米步跌不已，績低二三千元，紅糧疲乏，生仁平平，芝蔴堅挺，帶升三五千元，蠶豆零化轉動，疲而複擭，回漲三五千元，各糧漲跌互見。鮮肉拆價激漲　　〔本報訊〕鮮肉昨市突漲，每市擔由三十二萬激漲至三十九萬元。另　　肋每市斤五千元，條肋每市斤四千元，均較上日高出千元左右。據業中人稱：近日豬隻到源轉少，產地價格以食糧已漲，毛豬亦跟蹤騰踽。中農召集絲商代表　討論收購春繭計劃　廠商表示分區聯合收繭　　〔本報訊〕中國農民銀行為推動本年度收購春繭計劃，及討論整個絲業開展問題，昨特邀集十七家絲廠負青人談話。到農行經理王伯天，副理周紀曜等。廠商王化南·薛祖康·宋保林等。農行當表示：（一）收繭時之放款管理問題。頗感困難，應如何處理，方能管理嚴密，而使成本减低。（二）去年政府以二分低利，扶助絲繭生產，的一在解決蠶農生計，二在取鶴出口外匯。茲第一目的業已達到，而第二目的則尙待本年加强推進。（三）農行之憂慮，為瞻望絲繭價格，內銷將仍高於外銷。故恐本年所產各絲，將以D級以下者居多。各廠商對農行第一點意見，表示應分區聯合收繭，俾便於管理，互相監督，而减低成本。農行對廠商意見表示：（一）應連聯緊若干單組織配合起來。（二）收繭後應從速分配，俾　　更成本次熱各股買風雖健　永紗交易依舊最多　　華股昨不脫盤局，次熱股仍在置遍之買風下，繼續邁進，午後初見堅悄，但銳氣不久即吿减退，一部份大似有重做水紗之趨勢。　　晨開　　見昂，開後三五號一九九號有賣，一七九號八二號八三號則進而徘徊，三五號三六號二二四號二一八號二一一號一八〇號一九七號等賈出，遞永紗仍在套賣下，由二八〇〇元盤低至二六三〇元，九七號三二號八四號一三七號一四五號二三二號一五二號等紛向决熱若信和，美亞，景福，新光活動。次熱漲風激烈，人心仍俏。一九八號二一八號一二號一五四號一四五號四號三六號八九號均有吸納，內衣首先漲停，而將遞永紗升至二七七〇元。一六九號一八四號一一七號一五六號有脫手，回降至二七〇〇元，四號二二四號八四號一四五號一五二號一七八號八九號一三號一五號七六號二二號陸續吸收，麗安，水泥，中絲，新光、景綸，新華次第迫至漲停，逐漸拉高。十一時半後，漲到二八七〇元，八五號二〇三號九一號六一號趁勢有售，退至二八一〇元，但以二二三號三號二一八號一二號一四五號九五號三二號通袂吸收，午收仍在高檔徘徊。結果較前收計永紗中法升一成左右，美亞勸興升半成强，信和華　新光各升一成半弱，新華漲停，遞交永紗徵升，美亞漲半成强，信和華豐新光景福各升一成至一成半弱，冷股中絲國貨景綸　安內衣水泥迫停，大通永公新亞各漲一成强，五和平平，餘均升半成左右。　　午後　　一五號一五五號均進，而將　永紗扳高至二九二〇元，一九八號一五二號一三號八五號三六號七六號八九號一四號均答而盤低至二八二〇元，此時中絲，內衣，新華，　安，新光，大通次第漲停，人心尙秀，一四四統一四一號等有進，尙易回升至二九〇〇元光景，三時後，次熱股說氣大為減退，形勢漸露鬆懈，八五號一五二號二二三號七六號九九號連續供售，至迫低至二七八〇元，入後一八〇號二二二號一一二號一九八號二〇一號四號均居買方，而一五二號一三號二〇六號一八五號等則賣，是以市價始終在二八〇〇元迄二八五〇元之間排徊，收市仍站二八〇〇元關，結果較前收計永紗美亞升半成弱，中法勸興微升，信和華豐新光景福各升一成左右，新華漲停，遞交永紗美亞做升，信和景　升半成强，華豐新光升一成，冷股中絲嚴安內衣漲停，大通景綸新亞各升一成，中紡統益徵降，餘徵升迄半成強不等，塲外各股大生等尙平，餘稍下挫。中國火柴增資　　中國火柴股份有限公司，創設於民國二十一年七月，製造火柴，暢銷全國，為國人經營火柴事業之具有悠久歷史者。茲聞該公司為謀業務上之發展起見，已經本月二日股東臨時會決議，增責爲國幣三億元，業於三月七日起，開始辦理增資手續。證券號私營交易　社局函詢監理官　　〔本報訊〕社會局前奉令會同警局檢查證券堪外交易，於五日查得證交大樓，四一二室一百九十號經紀人樂茂號，五五三室八十四號經紀人福源號，四六六號泰豐號等，正在經營塲外交易，並私設對講電話甚多，詰諸各該號負責人據稱，關於塲外交易，事光仍用內轉賬方式轉入塲內賬册，對講電話一部份係由監理官許可，社會局以交易所各項法規及其中情形不甚明瞭，無法核辦，已函證交監理官查詢云。本年度絲繭業　發展問題　經農兩啊等召開座談會　　〔本報訊〕經濟部·農林部·中央銀行·中國農行·中蠶公司代表，於昨日下午二時，假失行舉行座談會，商討本年度絲繭業之發展計劃。出席者有葛敬中·易錫祥·廈道湘·馬保之·周紀曜·王紫霜·歐陽崙等。由中蠶提出建議書，各代表以此為根據廣泛交換意見，但意見仍未能完全一致。建議書將送呈晨經兩部審核，再呈政院核定。昨日之討論遍及蠶絲改良，生產成本减低，及加强外銷各項。同意之要點計有：（一）品質優良之生絲儘量外銷，較决者留國內自用。據中蠶人員表示：國外之織機，不能紡高級之絲·故質　之絲外銷，宣甚合理。（二）收購價格以够本為原則，大概每担繭之收價為三担米及四担米之間，視米價絲價之漲落而伸縮。此項彈性之規定，相當接受央行之意見。去年秋絲貸款之償還問題，決由晨林經濟兩部決定，希望本年能採取合的之方式。如此對借貸雙方較有的東力。據葛敬中氏表示：目前我國繭予少而絲廠多，希望能在全國絲廠中排選相當數量之絲車，製造質佳而能外銷之生絲。同時，為配合絲業之生產起計，短期貸款不適用，此點經提出商討後，已得中農之同意。外匯率調整後　地毯輸出有利　　〔本報訊〕我國華北所產之地毯，戰前全盛時代，年可輸出五百萬英方尺。戰後外銷，一落千丈。據專家估計：本年如各種生產條件恢復具備，至多亦不過輸出數十萬英方尺。最近外匯率調整後，輸出已大為有利。據稱：目前該項地毯之紐約市價，每英方尺價自美金三元至四元不等。　　又華北蘭州西寗寗夏三地所產之羊毛，最適於製造地毯。美國尤需該項原料，特列為免稅進口品。據估計：現留存上述三地之原毛，約有二千五百萬磅，的合淨毛一千二百五十萬磅。如全部輸出，可獲美匯六百萬元。　　華北所產西河硬粗，亦屬地毯原料之一，年產的二千五百萬磅，以每磅美元三角計，輸出後亦可易取美匯七百五十萬元。秋繭貸欵　已償半數　　〔本報訊〕去年政府發放秋繭貸款，共　百五十億元。後以秋繭收成未能盡達理想，該項貸款未經全部用足。目前已淸償之貸款，已達半數。未淸償者，尙有數十餘億元云。廢用鋼精透明紙　捲烟成本可减低　　自政府限制

<p>間諜漢奸　川島芳子自供　雙重禍國身份  南京三日快訊　本報特約記者丁匡華　　川島芳子是中日戰爭史上的「允物」，自從九一八事變起，以迄抗戰，大部份禍國的策劃和佈置，都是她一手造成的。站在間牒的技術講，她是「成功」了，可是以一個中國人忍心「認賊作父」，公然替本國的敵人策劃，危害太國，那實在罪大惡極了。「間牒」，「漢奸」，雙重　國身份，自不能以輕佻「人妖」兩字听能包括的。我們知道：間牒慣是殺人不見血的，何况是一個妖艷的女性？「色相嫵媚」，「人盡可夫」，不知多少熱血的同胞，死在她的「腰」下。川島芳子「腰間仗劍斬凡夫」的劊子手！國法人情，怎好容許妳這敗類存在。　　對女戰犯　密談生平活動　　飽受圖國生涯的川島芳子，自空運押解來京後，突又成為新聞人物了。她現在覊押國防部驗犯拘留所裏。記者作幾次前往訪問，但均因格於規定，而被檔　，因此記者羣祗能在室裏室外望望，偶一遇着「放風」的機會，能够看到她那副妖相，那副妖裝，那已是萬幸了。記者也是其中「光臨」人羣中之一，由于幾度的來來去去，戰犯拘留所的軍官們，對記者並不陌生了。在一天的下午，記者要求與川島芳子僅作五分鐘的談話時，一個軍官帶着笑容對記者說：「前幾天，當她放風的時候，你不是仔仔細細的看了半個鐘頭嗎？我可以吿訴你，她仍舊是西裝褲嗶嘰長袍的男裝打扮，吃的仍舊是西餐粗米飯，生活並沒有兩樣，不過地的態度沒有像她進來時那樣傲慢，你要與她談談，無非想知道她的過去，想找點新聞材料，那到不難。」記者逼着問道：「那就是難了，軍官是不是有所收穫，請吿訴我一點吧！」「我倒沒有，有的是聽得來的！」「請吿訴我。」於是他娓娓的吿訴記者，在一天查監的時候，川島芳子正與另一女戰犯談得很起勁，我沒有打擾她們，却靜悄悄地聽她們說着，那完全是川島芳子禍國的自招，也許可作史乘參考。　　親王後裔　認川島爲義父　　「聽說你是山國人，是的嗎？」另一女戰犯問。川島芳子答稱：「我原名金　輝，我的父親是　肅親王，名善曾，字艾堂，號偶亭主，今年如果活着已經是八十一歲的老人。在兄弟姊妹　中，我排行第十四，在宣統元年的那一年，生於北平橋船板胡同十八號，年紀已經三十八歲了。當我出生的時候，我的父親肅王在民政部尙書任內，創辦高等巡營學堂，監督為川島浪速，因為川島與我父親有着這樣的關係，後來我便認川島為養父了。這是我呌川島芳子的來歷了。我的父親死了以後，我的義父送我入松太女校讀書，未及一年，又將我送到鹿兒島的男子中學去，改穿男裝，更名金良太郎，從此養成我愛穿男服的習慣。自後年事日長，日本黑龍會的人看到我的聰明，就開始引誘我，從此我就落入日本人的圈套了，這是沒有父母造成的命運。」　　「你怎樣嫁給蒙古王呢？」　　「那是我為日本黑龍會犧牲的第一遭，因為他們想現實侵略滿業政策，所以便以我為工具，嫁給內蒙昭烏達盟巴林郡王為妃，時為民國十四年。兩年以來，受盡沙漠生活的痛苦，時時想脫離，苦無辦法，終於後來學會了騎馬，更探聽逃亡路綫，便於十六年春出走，回到日本。」　　「九一八」　是刀子一手佈置　　「你回到日本以後怎麼樣？」　　回到日本就與日本參謀本部第二科問諜頭目山村相得，我們還姘居一個時間。山村見我富於轉險性，遂把各種問諜技術傳授給我，以為侵略中國的工具。過了若干年，山村就把她介紹到日本駐中國關東軍特務機關去服務。常時特務機關負責人便是土肥原，土肥原看到我很機敏，對我很為愛寵，於是他又把平生對於中國所體騐到各階層的社會情形，儘量傳授給我，因此，我懂得了間謀的技術及其運用了。人家稱我為土肥原的助手，大概是從這裏開始的吧。」　　這時，川島芳子滔滔不絕的說下去：以後，土肥原便派我到東北各重要城市活動。那時，我深知中國間諜是不好惹的，為着安全，不得不準備和我容貌相間的「替身」，以進入各階層工作。從此，我的裝束，到一處就有一處的不同了，有時喬裝為女敎員，有時化粧旅行者·儘量設法與我的工作對象接近，一面偵察常地的軍事政治情形，一面甘言遊說，轉移當地人民對日本的觀念，並用金錢收買一班不肖之徒，充日本第五縱隊。為了進一步工作，常常喬裝為中國妓女，取朝鮮女子，出人於賭窟，嗎啡館，誘惑一班中國下級軍官與士兵，探聽軍機秘密。這樣，情報一天一天的多了，而且頗為正確，於是土肥原極端信任我，乃派這四百名問諜交我指揮。九一八事變，就是我佈置製造的。那時，我在東北，佈滿了「縱」「橫」間諜網，利用漢奸，消滅民衆抗日運動，並鼓勵抗日軍附逆。——由此不花一彈，不失一卒，而佔領了東北三省。」川島芳子自鳴得意似的。　　「一二八戰爭，我奉派上海工作，那時，我喬裝舞女，目的是誘惑一般中國軍政要員，刺探軍政消息。其時曾設法與十九路軍某軍官結識，直接抄獲軍事計劃，中國軍除的佈署，完全知道，日本軍部根據我的情報侵入上海，這算是我的第二功。」　　汪記傀儡　由她幕後牽綫　　一二八結束後，我又回到東北，熱河戰事爆發後，又組織義勇軍，「自任總司令，其後被任為偽滿女間諜部部長，熱河民國軍總司令，多有成就。八一三滬戰中，以日本聯合特務機關女子部部長的費格，化裝為中國士兵，探察軍情，為了工作，不能不如此了。」　　我化名李松祥，寄居香港皇家酒店，在這裏，曾結識汪精衛的內弟陳耀祖。汪記政府的成立，我曾為幕後牽綫的橋樑之一，影佐的聯絡，都是以我為依歸的。曾記香港未淪陷之先，虎門要塞日軍秘密軍事會議，我曾建議，要侵略香港，首先要奪昂船洲，然後取九龍和宋皇台高地，以宋皇台高地架設重砲，射擊太古船塢，並用遠　砲射英軍司令部。再由海軍陸　隊的排砲掩護，向七姊妹海峽渡海，因為七姊妹海峽是軍事配角，是英軍必爭之地，再一路由香港口，另一路由漢水　會師山塘水圩，破壞全港水電…這樣，香港俯首可得」。我的計劃，立被採納」。至此，另一女戰犯插了一聲，打斷他的自招，她說：「人們都稱你是金司令，這是什麼道理呢」？「說起笑話，司令不過是我的　號，在我四歲的時候，我父親正參加張勳的復辟運動，因為我那時候喜歡穿男裝，一般聽差，就這樣稱呼我」。「據說你見過日本的「天皇，又和東條一塊拍過照，是嗎」？「是的。那是以「川島浪速的公子身份和他們在一起拍的」。　　誰還要我　我也沒臉見人　川島芳子悽涼語！　　一個女戰犯問她：「沒有正式結過婚嗎」？「沒有，非正式」也沒有的！「假如你宣判無罪，那麼你的終身大事怎探處理呢」？「誰還要我，我也沒臉見人，倒不如乾脆上外國，或者找個廟。……」這裏似乎已經結束了這一段談話。記者聽到這僩軍官的陳述，如獲至實，雖不聽自用川島芳子的親供，一樣可以作信史參考。川島芳子此次純為戰犯高橋作證而來，不久仍須押返北平，記者今得意外的收獲，頗以詳述本報讀者為快事。　　充滿陰謀侵略之日軍閥拿手傑作　利用女　，從事間諜工作·川島芳子，竟入其榖中·圖示日軍閥利用日本女性串演通婚之一幕·（本報資料室）彭城亂彈　徐州二百快訊  本報特派員　房滄浪　　蘇北相定，魯難未已，好亂成性的妄人，退出魯南不久，又在魯中膠東，掀起連天烽火，大局演變到如此地步，飽嘗亂離之苦的蘇督兩省人民，誰都看清，目前中共是一不做，二不休，索性搗亂到底，來個「以戰養戰」的戰略，企圖達到擴大戰區，糜爛全國，牽制國軍，困擾政府，而便於向國外報銷的一種欺騙政略，中共旣然如此執迷不悟，那負有保障人民生命財產安全重賣的政府，當然不能熟硯無覩，儘作挨打的姿態，坐觀戰區人民陷入水深火熟的苦境而不救，於是以革命為己任的國民政府，終於被迫不得不採取毒蛇螫手壯士斷腕的方法，遂行「以戰止戰」的英明決策，規束三軍，綏靖地方，較勵人民，奮起自衛，以朮達成縮短戰爭，保衛人民，還軍於國，還政於民之大願，情勢如此，事實如此，大概在中共沒有澈悔悟以前，是無法避免戰禍的　　不到徐州，就無法明瞭因戰亂而引起的各種不幸問題之嚴戒性，不至戰地，不知戰亂所造成的災害，是如何的慘酷，到了徐州以及戰地，你才明白，如果以熱血籌造抗戰勝利的軍人，不以英勇果敢的戰鬥行為，來縮短戰爭，我們全中國至少將有二萬萬以上的人民，會在紅色恐怖的氛圍中，活活餓死，悶死，以眼前的實事為例，蘇北是滿目　痍，魯南是赤地千里，於是徐州運進來的糧食要多，運出去的糧食允多，徐州當地的豬肉每斤只賣二千四百元，牛肉每斤二千元，雞蛋每個一百六十元，母雞每斤一千八百元，而秈米每石要賣近十萬元，二等麵粉每袋也賣出四萬元，糧食問題的嚴重性，暴露了中共脅迫農民，放棄生產的全盤罪惡，而某些人們及一般國民道德水準之墮落，也顯示唯有排除障碍，縮短戰爭，切實整軍，刷新政治，才能起衰振頺，走上建國的大道。　　說到戰事，在徐州這一方面，的確是毫無誇張，雖然魯西南的半　妖氛，幾告廓清，而津浦北段的左中右三面，在一星期以內竟通續收復了滕縣，鄒縣，曲卑，汶上，四個縣城，說不定，在一個月以內，就可打通津浦綫的徐濟段，在排除建國障碣，出民水火的大前提下，國軍的士氣，眞令人可歌可泣，但是勝仗雖然是越打越起勁，收復縣城的捷報，每天幾乎都可以看到一份，然而無論在官文書上，或者是將領們的談話中，可找不出半點兒驕氣和喜氣，今日國軍官兵，確實受了元首蔣公約精神感召，一致服　「得其情也，哀矝勿喜」的明訓，來應戰還戰，這較之十年以前抗戰初期的徐州，已有顯著進步，可是，在相對的一方，就大大不同，下面所說，又是一個明證。「三八」溯源　國際婦女節史話  本報資料室　　姊妹們的紀念日　開始求解放　　「三八」，這嚴於姊妹們的紀念日，是有極遠大意義的，他是全世界婦女求解放的開始，正和勞工們規定五一為國際勞動節同一因素。在時間上，國際婦女節是比國際勞動　晚了二十年，但在人類解放的歷史上，却是一對亙相關聯的孿生兒。　　一九一〇年，各國的婦女代表，集合在丹京哥本哈根，討論保護女權，要求婦女選舉權，聯絡國際婦女等問題。這是國際婦女代表會第三次的會議，在道會議中，婦女運動的創導者蔡特金女士，提議規定三月八日為國際婦女節。從此每年這一天，就成為婦女們的日子了。　　受美國婦運影響　喚醒了迷夢　　國際婦女節的規定，表示婦女運動是已到成熟的時候，道是受了美國婦女運動的影響所致。一九〇九年三月，芝加哥的啼女，為了抗議男女的不平等，結合了數千人，舉行一次示威大遊行。後來全美的婦女都起來響應，不久這運動蔓延到各城布。道一次是婦女運動中空前的盛大節目，引起了各國人士的注意，喚醒了世界的迷夢。　　為什麼定在三月八日呢？三月八日是第二次國際婦女代表會開會的日子，於一九〇七年在德國司徒嘉德城中舉行的。那次會議，以「婦女選舉權」為討論的中心。同時成立了一個秘書處，這是國際婦女經常組織的雛型。所以在一九一〇年開會的時候，規定上屆的開會日期為國際婦女節。　　爭取選舉參政權　實行組織化　　一九〇六年在倫敦召開了國際婦女代表會，這是歷史上第一次的國際間婦女聯絡。那决參加的代表，有三十多人，包括英·美·德·俄·波蘭·比利時等國，目的是在爭取婦女參政權和母性保護。從此婦女在國際問纔有了組織，有了聯絡，向着光明的前途邁進。　　產業革命爆發後　婦女鳴不平　　世界婦女形式上的結合，是從一九〇六年起的。但婦女運動在一九〇六年以前就開始了。數十年的農業封建社會，女性總是處於被壓迫的境地，直至產業革命後，工廠紛紛地建立起來了，那裏吸收了大批的女工。廠主是樂於雇用女工的，因為她們工資聯廉，同時又容易加以管理。工業興盛，商業也跟着繁榮起來，都市中許多行政機關也隨着擴充了，工作人員的需要大為增加，於是有一部份的工作，改由婦女來担任。　　產業革命的結果，財富集中在少數人手裏，許多做父親的，為丈夫的，獨自不能維持家庭的生活，不得不把喪女送到工廠中去做工，或充任旁的職業。因此，工廠裏女工不斷的增加，都市裏也產坐了一大羣職業婦女。她們離開了家庭，在社會中生活，漸漸能洞察社會眞相。　　男女工資不一律　待遇求平等　　社會上男女的待遇是不平等的。工廠中的男女工人，工資是不一律的，機關中女職員的薪金，要比男職員低得多。初踏入社會的婦女們，對於這些，尙覺得有些模糊。但日子一久，她們的意識漸漸地淸楚了，開始對於這不同的待遇，發生懷疑。她們覺得和男子同樣工作，同樣貢獻其精力與社會，為何受着不同的待遇呢？所以最後不得不起來作不平之鳴了。郝鵬舉被害可能　李仙洲被俘說實無根據　　以郝鵬舉生死之謎為例，據近從魯南臨沂鄉間來的老百姓說，郝被刦後，已被共軍在臨沂東鄉弄死，處死的刑法，是一種中古時代極野蠻的懲罰，當時係由一中共高級政工人員，召集一所謂「人民公審大會」在一陣數說「出賣中共」「背叛人民」「反抗革命」的罪各下，予以活埋，此外，又有人說，郝已於上月二十日晚，在臨沂以東之湯頭，為共軍槍斃，總之，郝已被害，似無疑問，而長於宣傳的中共，居然在不久以前，播出郝與陳毅的談話問答，眞可謂多此一舉，至於中共所稱李仙洲將軍被俘一說，國防部已鄭重否認，據可靠方面消息，李將軍可能在博山附近，華領一部孤軍，東馳西突，繼續與共軍苦戰，或謂李於彈盡力盡，陷身共軍重關時，壯烈殉國，後說似比較可信，而被俘一說，則絕對不確，徵之過去中共宣傳所謂車　如少將等被俘一類謊言，則此種謠傳，不辯自明。　　蘇北重光，魯南紋平，陳毅知道在沂蒙山區活不下去，遂帶着一羣餓狼竄往魯中，侵人膠濟淄博鑛區，掩飾敗績，藉團茍活，於是全長三九三公里的膠濟路，又被共軍攪得七零八落，戰火且燎原至濟南外圍，在一週以前，一般不明共軍實力的人們對於濟南目前的局勢，當時或不免有祀人之憂，直到魯中國軍由博張一綫從容轉進，化內綫為外綫，誘致此一羣餓狼於膠濟沿綫，而予以重大打擊之後，濟南局勢，益趨穩定，此際沿津浦北上之國軍，遂排　而入，一舉手即收復滕鄒，與死守兗州十五個月之吳化文部，會師兗州，飲馬汶上，光復東方唯一聖地之曲阜，以吿慰我至聖先師孔老夫子之在天之靈，齋戒禱吿曰：「孔聖：孔聖天佑中華，賊子已去，我們回來了」雖然，孔廟祭器，均已被盜，森森林木，盡砲斧斤，而聖地重光，泰岱在望，眼雲步行三日，就可到連那家家泉水，戶垂楊的歷下古城，佇待打通津浦北段徐濟的好消息，這給予希望由恢復交通的正途而穩定國內經濟的人們是萬分的喜悅，無比的安　，這給予侵入膠濟共軍將領們的，當然無異是一盆冷水，　局似乎已演進至津浦北路爭奪戰的序慕了，苦戰於天南地北的國軍將士們，他們可能在今年中秋，安坐津浦通車，欣然歸去一享天倫之樂了，　　熱望以戰止戰　　誠然打仗不是一件好事，兵凶　危，古有明訓，何况在被亂安內的期間，站在戰塲幕前的都是中國人，最好不要打，但這須要看站在敵對一方的，是不是還有人性，如果沒有人性，惟知口講「民主」，終年弄兵作亂，玩弄人民戕賊人民生命財產，破壞工鑛，毀壞鐵路，置國家民族前途於不堪想像之境，那簡直是亂臣賊子的行為，人人得而誅之，還是一個最　鮮明白的道理，現在國軍官乒及共軍中之覺悟份子，均能理解當前國民政府被迫還戰，熱望以戰止戰，縮短戰爭，以免戰區擴大，禍延全國，一種不得已而戰的苦衷，一致譴賣中共迷信武力萬能之不是，下面又是一個實證。　　縮短戰事良藥　　當上月陳誠上將飛臨徐州不久，在蘇北魯南魯西共軍佔領區上空，忽然飄下大批五色繽紛的東西，當時共軍官兵以為這大概又是什麼美國香烟罐頭救濟品了，大家曾紛往搶拾，後來看出是國防部昭告共軍官兵的勸降傳單，於是，就在所謂指導員一類的人物禁止拾閱的嚴令下，很多人都悄悄的藏起了一張，意思是看看究竟說些什麼，可是，當一班終平餓着肚皮，速黑煎餅都吃不着，正在走投無路的共軍官兵看完道寥寥數語「只須悔悟，不究旣往，携械投誠，一律優遇」的招降書吿後，不多時，就發生極大的功效，在臨沂收復前後，結伴機械向國軍投誠的共軍官兵，有不少是中共認為可靠的「老幹」，結果如此，可見共軍一方的士氣，是如何消沉，這也是將來縮短戰爭的一帖良藥。　　到了徐州不久，覺得這古彭城雖然已經披上一襲新裝，但在多種人的生活方面，記者還沒有發現所謂戰時生活，較之二十七年的春間，有若何差異，諸如花園飯店之天天客滿，致美樓和東來春這一類飯館之常吿滿座，銷金窟似的金谷里，肉價雖昂，而不患無人光顧，這都和二十七年的春天，一樣熱鬧，所不同的，那時物價尙廉，幣值較高，看不出古彭城胃口的廣大，不像現在動輒每個月要吞吐二百億以上的花鈔票，逗開了四十六家金銀店，上月金潮冲到大徐州，於是金舖銀棋一齊關上了門，直到今天，還在「春眠不覺曉」毋怪徐州人說：馬路上不及從前熱鬧了。</p>

<p>春秋文藝茶座的展望  華林　　中國封建的社會，只有親族的往還酬應，沒有社會的公共生活，在歐洲各網人民的生活都離不開公園，森林，博物院，岡書館，國家大戲院，和音樂會等公共塲所，——這是東西洋生活上的分歧。　　在中國，處處皆是家庭化的私生活集團，就是鄕村，也是王家莊趙家莊，漫野荒壤，素不注重公共園林，一切公共事業，都爲人據所私有。古物不放在博物院，多屬私人收藏，或由古董商販賣，岡書也是一樣，只有大家富戶，私人皮藏，戲劇作爲宮廷供奉，音樂則多半爲冶遊享樂，公北娛樂和學術活動更是談不到了。　　所以我們要努力改造道封建社會，就是要把家族思想。地方觀念，完全消滅；用社會公共的組織，公共的生活，來促進人民生活的進步。譬如巴黎的蒙巴拉斯的文藝咖啡館，羅馬的公道地街上文藝咖啡館，其實歐洲各國優美風景的地方，古代建築的街旁，到處都有咖啡館。我們中國小城裏或都市中，雖也有茶館，但是含有學術性的却很少，即上海偌大的商埠，也不容易尋到很好的地方。　　因此我們發起了「文藝茶座」，「文藝茶話會」和北四川路的「文美茶室」，這些都是文藝界朋友，大家的定時間聚會的塲所。大家除了聚會聯誼之外，就是愛好學術，不含有一點兒政治作用；因爲我們根本就認爲民間的文化交流，比政治關係更重要。　　我個人對文藝茶座，也有幾點希望：　　希望文藝界人士踴躍參加，改變封建習慣，打破門戶界限。大家毫無成見的携起手來。　　養成互相觀摩研究的風氣，培養健全的創造精神。關於國家或地方的一切文化建設，隨時建議，隨時提倡。　　努力國際文化合作，促進世界和平；文藝界每個人更要從民間聯誼人乎，負起保障人道的責任。　　此外我們很希望，各處多多的發起這一類的文藝茶座，不用開會的形式，更不要主席與訓話式的講滇，不是說講演不重要，因爲那是另外一回事。文藝茶座注重在各別的自由談話，注重在側別的友情交流，却不妨陳列些美術品，演奏點音樂，總以不碍自由活動爲原則，各人約各人的朋友，願意介紹，再互相介紹，這樣各人的朋友都可以變成大家的朋友，家庭化的個人生活就可以變成社會化的公共生活，然後便可大家携手共進！往事  蘇姍　　善於留戀時光的人，始終是有悲哀。時光息息在轉流，醉生夢死的看不到它，勇往直前的無暇顧及。所悲者，是徬徨的人們，在往來的途中，總有些悱惻的故事。刻在心版上，就成爲永遠的磨折。　　惑情原來像水，平靜地即使是微風也會引動它的波紋。何况是那像排山倒海般的激動呢？刻下的創痛，玷上了的瑕點，不堪回首。渦去的是一片烟霧，一塲未醒的噩夢，以致舉首看未來，也是迷茫。　　昔日跋扈之念，溜了。豪華的一剎那，如剝落褪色了的朱鬥，看那雄壯故國的城續吧！雖然還多少有的未消逝的氣魄。但是在根畔，已有了雜生的野草，綠茵似的靑苔。傾斜的，陷缺的祇能作爲畫家筆下的風景，和遠道而來孤雁的歇脚處。然而，當年它是有過輝煌的史蹟。有人在這裏攻打，有人在這裏據守，有臣子跪迎過帝皇，有矯妻送別過郎君。一代復一代，永遠替別人　製回憶。　　在內地，途徑某些地方，可以看到一片幾十里沒有人烟，沒有喬木的曠野。有人告訴說：這是「古戰塲」。戰爭原是古已有之，並非條在歷史的課本上多添幾頁，除給人憑弔之外，還留給人有更多的感傷。　　客鄉歲暮的寒夜，單獨的對着豆火，比昨日更淸楚的會記起童年的情景，有老年的祖母，雖然過着的是板壁裏蛀蟲般的生活，但是她依舊還能絮絮述出驚心動魄的往事。　　搬出蒙了塵灰的唱片，奏一支「藍色的多瑙河」，當還能想起昔日與情侶婆娑起舞的一支「華爾滋」。死灰中重撩燃靑春之火。往年的一個香吻，給陳絹上抹下一斑紅色的荳寇，在心靈上却抹下了永恒的辛酸。　　回到離別久遠的母校去，看曾坐過數年的敎室裏依舊有敎師在唾沫四濺的講解，撫摸那久別的几物，恐怕將有新的同學來迎問「客人，你從何處來的呵！」　　逝去的歲月，像雲，像烟，像流水，像流星。旋轉，旋轉，施轉。輕輕的溜過去了，即使是上帝，也無法挽回。　　無論有多少閒暇，燃起一支烟，讓自己浸到海　天空深遠的回憶去。這裏的滋味，是一支筆所不能寫其萬一的。有機緣的話，找個孩子來，在他身上有你自己童年的影子。一個女人  鮑雨　　我每天得經過一條小河，至少要有四次。因爲我從寓處到工作地點，從工作地點回寓處，這條小河是我必經之地。　　這條小河，因爲兩頭已經雍塞，水面上非但沒有美麗的波紋，並且經常呈着慘綠的顏色，同時還發散着一種難聞的腥臭的氣味。　　河的兩旁，排列着許多房舍，但多數已經年久失修，呈現着非常敗壞的景象，就是幾株樹木，也特別地顯出蒼老的樣子。　　當走過河邊的時候，總見到有許多住在附近的婦女們，蹲在堤旁，她們在洗穢布，刷馬桶　　例外見到的是一個五十多歲的年老女人，她，蓬髪，乾枯的臉，一雙眼睛呆瞪着，嘴唇不斷地抖動，在作無聲地說話和歌唱。　　她穿着一身長長的藏靑緞的棉襖，上而鑲着闊闊的邊，顯然是古舊的衣服了。黑袴子，紮緊袴管，一雙小脚穿上黑的鞋子。走起路來，步伐跨得很小，身子在微微地扭動，似乎很文弱的樣子。　　有時我見她呆站在小河旁，兩眼瞪着那慘綠色的死水，嘴唇在動，兩雙瘦弱的手，做出各種的姿勢：她一忽兒作吹蕭吹笛的姿勢，一忽兒改作喝酒揮拳的姿勢，一忽兒作彈琴狀，一忽兒又作下棋狀……一忽兒笑，一忽兒哭。　　儘管四周圍着很多的人，在好奇地看着她，她彷彿沒有看見一樣，她是置身於另一個環境中。　　遇到有玩皮的孩子，故意地把野草投在她身上，或者在她衣服的後面，塗抹着白粉的時候，她會狠狠地駡人，有時也會把小石塊對他們擲過去，因爲她的夢境被破壞了，她憤怒。　　在三十多年以前，這條河是運鹽河的一條支河。那時河面相當寬關，岸上房舍很整齊，同時兩旁的樹木很多，綠蔭濃鬱，幽幽地，添上不少佳趣。　　有不少鹽商們，從海濱運了鹽渦米，就把鹽船停泊在這條河面上，高高的桅桿，差不多像森林一樣，密密地直豎着。鹽商們的生活，大都不甘寂寞，他們就在水上造起樂園來，每當夜晚，船上都掛起各式各樣的花燈，盪漾的河水，映着多種顏色的燈光燈影，編織成綺麗的錦紋。於是有多少綺麗的事蹟，也就從此產生了。　　小琴是一位紅姑娘，她的走紅，不但是因爲她年輕，長得漂亮，同時還爲了她有一副動人的歌喉，和一手嫻熟的吹彈技藝的關係。　　許多鹽商們都爭相追逐她，她彷彿是一顆鑽石般的亮星，照耀着這條河，同時也照耀着許多男人們的心。她並且是一株搖錢樹，當時靠她過活的，有乾爺，乾娘，樂師，琴師，伴娘，裁縫，廚司，轎夫，以及梳頭娘姨，裹脚娘姨，珠寶商人等北有百來個人呢。　　過去的那個紅姑娘，就是現在時常站在河邊的這個年老的女人。　　幾個捧着水烟袋及銜着長烟管的年老人，他們告訴我這個傳奇的故事，同時感喟地說：　　「誰會相信呢？曾經產生出許多風流事件的這條河，現在已經變成一條死水；曾經顯倒衆生的這個紅姑娘，現在已經獎成一個孤獨的瘋老太婆！」　　等到明白她過去的情形以後，每次看見她時，我格外的注視她的臉，注視她的每一動作。我利用我的兩眼，像考古家尋覓古蹟一樣地，想在她整個身上，找尋到一點她過去的風韻，可是結果，她給我看見的是一個密佈皺紋的臉，一雙可怕的眼睛，和一個瘦弱的身子，也像站在死水畔，找不到從前的景色一樣。　　我遷了寓處以後，這條河邊，已經不是我的必經之地。因此瘋女人也有好多時候不見了。　　一天，偶然到河邊，我又見到了她。她穿的衣服還和從前一樣，臉色更加難看了。當時她在啼哭，原因是有人在河裏捕魚，忽然摸到一隻玉鐲，適巧給她看見了，她說這是她掉下去的，一定要拿回。可是捕魚人不願意。　　「强盜，搶人的東西！這玉鐲明明是我的，我能告訴你上面有幾顆紅點子，幾絛紋路，爲什麼你不還給我？這是什麼世界！這是强盜的世界呀！」她一面哭，一面啼。　　捕魚的人走開去了，她無可奈何地自語着：　　「那是一個月夜，我和一個姓陳的挺年輕的鹽商，在船上喝酒，因爲他在天明，就要開船離開我了，我怕他走了以後就不會想到我，我就把手臂上一隻心愛的玉鐲拋在水裏，我對他說，你不來，就像這隻鐲……」她說到這兒，哭得格外厲害了：「玉鐲，玉錫，已經給我見到了，可是那個姓陳的呢？不知道到那裏去了！」　　接着她忽然若有所見地，向河中招手，並且呌着：　　「小陳！哦，老王，老徐　你們原來都在那船上，請等一等我，我就來！……」　　說着，她向小河走下去，結果旁邊有一人把她拉住了。……　　從那决以後，我一直沒有機會到河邊去。　　我在一個無意間，聽到一件新聞：　　運鹽河的支河邊，有一個瘋老太婆投河死了。投河以前，把自己打扮起來，梳了光光的頭髮，髮　上插滿了許多玉簪子，臉上還擦了胭脂和粉，穿一身綠花緞的舊時衣服，黑綢裙子，小脚上穿一雙繡花的紅鞋。臂上，胸上，以及袴帶上佩着許多件的玉器。當從水裏被撈起來的時候，她的嘴邊似乎有一絲笑紋。唯一的語言  林慧　　這是一個最普通的問題，就是當我們拿起筆寫作的時候，我們常常要感到一陣勝躇；怎樣寫呢？用那個詞好些呢？又有時我們心裏有一片很好的意思，可是等把它移在紙上的時候，往往會感到意外的失望，因爲寫出來的不是走了樣，便是貧乏而無力，這都是使每一個寫作者感到苦惱的事。　　其實這是不必太擔心的，這是寫作必有的過程，只要經過長時期的修養和磨練，這個難關便不難打破。不過我們在學習寫作的時候；不要求速成，不要期待奇蹟；不要以多爲勝；不要嚮往一字不易而寫就那麼輝煌的劇作的莎氏比亞；不要醉心兩個禮拜寫成一部「少年維特之煩惱」的歌德；文學是世問最精微細密的一門學問，必須深切的斟酌體味，才能達到圓熟純凈的境界。所以對於一般靑年的學習者，惟有托爾斯泰那樣精勤謹嚴的作家，才能給與更多的帮助。大家該都知道這個故事：有一次，托氏巳經將文稿寄出去了，他忽然想起某一個字用得不恰，於是趕緊坐上馬車到驛站去，給報館拍個電報更正渦來。他更改的雖是一個字，但其意義却不止於一個字，欲使其藝術愈發顯露，而達到完美無瑕之境，這一個字也是不可忽略的。在這裏，我們當會感到一種超俗的嚴肅的態度，這不但值得學習，而且令人敬仰。　　簡單的說，我們不憚煩的在文章上作修改整理的工夫，不過是想找尋比寫出的詞句更恰常的詞句。換句話說，就是探求惟一的語言。這裏是最顯明的兩個例子：賈島的詩有句云：「僧推月下門」。他的一位朋友把「推」字易爲「敲」字，這句詩乃臻化境。又范仲淹嚴子陵祠堂記云：「先生之德，山高水長」。經人把「德」字易爲「風」字，原來極平板的句子，馬上神韻悠然了。一字之差，便有雲泥之別。果眞這種化平易爲神奇的技巧是什麼呢？其實極單純，不過是找到了描寫那個境界的唯一的語曾罷了。如果用王國維先生的「隔」與「不隔」的說法來解釋，那麼用「推」字「德」字成文便量「隔」，用「敲」字「風」字成文便是「不隔」；「隔」的永遠不能脫離平凡的階段，「不隔」的才能引起讀者的共鳴。所謂藝術，亦便在此產生，幷發揮其效果。　　另外一個最好的例子，是編羅貝爾敎授莫泊桑的一段插話。　　莫泊桑向福樓貝爾求敎，福氏這樣的告訴了他：「當你走過坐在門口的雜貨商人面前，吸着烟的管門人而前，街頭馬車的停車塲前邊的時候，你就用習作的手法，把那　貨商人和管門人，與我所寫的其他的雜貨商人管門人相似的，從他們的姿態及全部形狀中，很巧妙的，包括着他們的品格性質的描寫出來給我看。面且要單一用一句話，指出其中的一匹馬，和其他前後左右五十匹馬的不同地方來告訴我」。這段自然主義大家的話，如果按照莫泊桑的解釋，其意義便會更加明顯，同時，他給與我們的益處也便更大：「我們所要說的是什麼，要把這事物表現祇有惟一的一旬話；要使這事物生動，祗有惟一的動詞；要形容這事物，也祗有惟一的形容詞；所以我們必須要找到這句話，這個動詞，這個形容詞才罷休；決不能因爲想避免困難，就任意胡謅以求滿足，即使能夠寫下去，也只有否曲欺騙，祗能玩弄言詞的　術」。　　唯一的語言，不是藉模倣而產生，不是藉幻想而產生，它是來自深刻的觀察和縝密的思索。每一事物，都有描寫他的惟一的語言，這全看你能否找得到它。爲使我們的作品跨過平凡的水綫，我們要穿過那表面的厚幕，探求事物的底裏，這時才會發現一般人所見不到的眞實，而當你把它們寫出來時，自然會找到了唯一的語言，這是一種元全嶄新的語言。（卅六年元宵節前一日安陽）一寸山河一寸血　192  葉勁風　　這時我方發現近門邊的畫綫條板上，另外還有一隻小型電燈，仍舊一閃一閃地發着紅光，閃爍的問歇，與嗤嗤的響聲，彼此符介。我剛發現了這點佈置，直覺上正在形成第二種發現時的時候，身旁突然有個淸　甜潤的嗓音，嚶嚶嚀嚀，又像低吟，父像呢喃，輕輕的念着；念的腔調，好像低聲誦禱似的：　　一敵人己由三面巡近本樓：正西，西市，西北，人數總共的七十餘名，正西由交民巷北路侵來，有輕機槍二挺，領隊是一女子……本樓方面，遵令佈置，已經完成……突擊各支隊已出發；未得情報，恐尚未達目的地……」　　念出這段電訊的，常然就是耀羣。電訊到此，嗤聲和燈光，戛然停住，耀羣的聲音，也隨着消失；屋子內立刻沉寂如死。　　這種電訊傳話，方式極其簡單方便本來也是諜探工作上一門普通功課，受過訓練的人，却知道如何收發。收發的工其，不盡限於電訊，無論何種聲，形，都可應用：聲的方面，如敲，拍，吹，噓，任何器物，任何聲響；形的方面，如手勢，旗語，反光，烟火，任何可以月擊的方式都行，只要能够控制間歇停放，就可傳話。當然這些工具之中，要以電機所發聲光之類，最合理想。　　至於傳話的形成，原是採用「空谷專聲」老法，用間歇停頓的變化，把子音母韻表現出來；正如西文電碼，以點綫變化代表字母一樣：譬如無諭在「聲」或「形」上，一「短逗」代表一子音；如「邦」；一「長頓」代表一母韻如「阿」。子母聯合，即成「波」，或「玻」，或「博」。或「跛」，或「播」，等等，再如兩「短逗」代表子音如「曲」；；「短逗」加」「長頓」代表母韻如「昂」，則所得爲「長」，或「昌」，或「唱」或「常」或「　」，或「暢」，等等。這「短這」或「長頓」無論在燈光，或拍掌發聲上，都可用間歇來控制。　　不過這種傳聲方式不難，難在辨認同音同聲的字。聲尚可用符號來控制，反正北方只有陰平陽平和上去四種，南方加一入聲，也只五種。惟有同音同聲的名詞，如「佔駐」和「暫住」，就有些不易肯定。好在諜報工作，說話多半有習用的術語，更有目標範國，雷同的名詞很少，還不致於混淆。並且遇有不大熟悉的同音名詞，通常還可以加上一個註解。　　這種傳聲方式，在諜探工作中，旣是人人懂得，豈不容易暴露秘密？殊不知其中正有許多「有機」的變化，滲雜其中，沒有探明個中關鍵，不僅無法接收，即使接收了去，也僅僅是一串子母音韻，無法解釋。　　耀羣對於電機秘密通訊，研究極深，這次所收的電機團聲，是W君部下最通行的一種，並日沒有參加「　機」變化，所以可能直接讀出。這時一者事情緊急；二者，這個電訊，同時要發送到十幾間屋子內，讓本樓凡有高級職司的，都能同時收到這個警報，所以這件工具，就比較電話來得方便而有效多了。而且同時發出，又能節省時間和手續。哭金松岑先生  黃雲眉　　眉公去後可憐春（註一），到此鷥花盡作塵。諸老蕭條成異代，太湖浩淼失期人！帳前弟子粲彝鼎，杯外文章森甲鱗。夜半明燈觀鬼谷，知音日沈感獨沾中（註二）！　　（註一）石遺老人寓居蘇州胭脂巷，與先生頗相得，余嘗與先生赴老人的飮，老人録余詩入石潰室詩話續編中，並以謝山二雲相期許。七七變起，老人歸侯官原籍病卒，余則流離十年，大荒厥業，今日哭先生，又當重哭老人已，　　（註二）先生有天放樓集行世，健筆縱橫，萬夫辟易。余著古今偽書考補證時，嘗評及先生諭鬼谷文，先生不以爲忤，轉　獎借，偉抱冲襟，致足欽敬！嗣先生主編國學論衡，數徼余稿，余亦樂於質正。茲聞溘逝，能不興牙琴之感乎！人物  顧飛獨泊漫談  王聰　　一春天，幾個未婚的男孩子見訪。　　談話轉到婚姻問題，對於妻子的條件，衆說紛紜，最後要我發表意見。我想起了姜曾和菊說過的幾旬話，茲爲充實於左：　　標準妻子的條件有三——　　一爲主婦——能麼去工作的痕跡底。　　二爲貴婦——如七實樓台，珠光寶氣，令人目眩二高不可攀底。　　三爲蕩婦——瞭解人類生命之所由，在某種情態下，能充分表現人性底。　　自然，這是一個自私的男子底要求，至於標準丈夫的條件維何？只有求諸女士們自爲解答耳。　　在學術的苑囿裹，我是一生低徊日耳曼底。正如朋友李長之說的那樣，德國學者們底語言，有形而上的意味，討諭問題時往往能直搗核心。　　例如婚姻間題。　　尼采的幾句話是耐人尋味的，他說：「婚姻的結合，應當不是戀愛的結合，而是友誼的結合。因爲愛戀是暫時底，友誼是永久底；戀愛是情慾底，友誼是理想底。」　　「靑春底美麗，乃是「自然」替婦女裝置的武器或工具，只是爲了她們的生存，這種武器或工具的拖握久暫，也只是看她們的需要情形而決定。芷有如母蟻，生育以後，則喪失了飛翅。因爲飛翅會損害到幼蟲的生長。婦人亦然，旣生一子或二子後，大抵便喪失了她們的美麗。推老其原由，或出一轍。」　　這是叔本華的妙諭，（大意如此，手頭無書，未能錄其原文。）如果這論點是被你所心許的話，那麼尼采的話對你是那適合沒有，暫時底情慾底戀愛會與母蟻的飛翅同時喪失，只有永久底理想底友誼纔能與靈魂之愛同在。自由談「婦女節」雜話  唐汕　　有人憤慨地說：國際問有三八「婦女節」，爲什麼沒有我們「男兒節」，話雖近於戲謔，但從此可見男女平等之爭，各方面是存着意氣的。而所謂自由平權，也彷彿只是在這等臺無攸關上鬧着玩兒。　　「夫榮妻貴」這句話，充份的說明婦女的貴賤是依附於男十的。爲了這樣，許多榮夫便成爲不名譽的人物或犯罪者，而婦女本身也成爲罪惡的原由。　　多數的婦女刋物和文章都是由男子代庖的。因此，一切有關婦女解放與文化的運動，充其量是男子們可憐婦女的一種貓哭老鼠聲，眞正的作爲婦女解放的理論與實際却永遠受着壓抑。　　中等敎育又規定要男女分校，理由是男女在靑春發動期，可能發生諸種不道德的行爲，有傷社會風化看來非待一天男女在生理上也平等了，男女問題是難解決的。　　五四時代，文化敎育以反封建爲標幟，於是男女實行同學；想起當年許多靑年男女犧牲了他們的幸福所獲得的成果，今日此舉實令人懷疑這時代是在進步還是到退？　　多少人靑備婦女以裝飾時髦，成爲社會奢糜的風尚；殊不知一切飾裝的製成與提倡却是男子們的匠心。男子把一切的時髦製成了箭，然後射到女人身上去，自已却在一邊看她們的犧牲引爲快樂。　　「一夫一妻」也好，「一妻一夫」也好，婦女本身沒有深切的覺悟與團結，結果便只有一夫多妻制。　　兒童與家庭的問題，如果不能獲得合理的解決，新婦女的道路仍是非常偏狹而困難的。和公務員歎　（惜餘春調）　有序  攸同　　自經濟緊急措施後，待遇調整無期，各地物價，照常上漲，小子九口之家，寅吃卯糧，今晚報　索欠兩月報資，推期月望，偶憶聊齋鬼詞，酌更敎字以爲和。　　基數低微，加成無望，日日爲錢顚倒，各區各級，文武同人，同是一般懷抱。恁金潮戢平，物價仍增，便如春草。自過年，只在奈何天裏，度將昏曉。　　今日個，蹙損春山，望穿秋水，待遇調整難了。妻兒對泣，債主常臨，要睡何能睡好，漫道長宵如年，儂道一年，比更猶少，過三更已是三年，更是何人不老！「觀棋不語」  夏羽　　朋友們在下棋我在旁邊看，我始終沒有說一句話，因爲我遵守着一句「觀棋不語」的古語。可是我都這麼想，假如有二個人他借了你的棋子棋盤，在你的桌子上下棋，你也在邊上看他們下着，儘管他二人如何鈎心鬥角，你自然以不作聲爲宜，可是他們爲了「爭子」，爲了「爭走」或那一方面走得不合理，他們開始爭吵起來了，更各不相讓的打起來了，撕破了棋盤，毀掉了棋子，甚至更打破了桌子，那麼這時你是否還是默默無言做一個道地的君子人，看他們打出個你死我活來呢？還是去勸解他們復歸於好呢？若是你仍以「觀棋不語」的能度，勢必你的棋子，棋盤毀干他們之手，即桌子椅子以及其他東西都在所難免，因爲他們已是越出了下棋範圍，而眞的鬥起武來了。所以這時你不必再觀棋不語，而應當去制止他們的動武。「論語」的好壞　雜誌書報介紹之二  果華　　　　聽到若干朋友說，論語比以前不如了。有時候自己翻開來看一兩行，也覺得有點不對胃口。今日飯後，拿起一本新出的一二四期，差不多從頭到尾耐着性子看了一遍，才發覺論語並沒有變，變的倒是自己的胄口。　　正如編者所說，「此番時局的動盪，沒有一個人不受到切身的影響，透不過氣來，也寫不出文章」。同樣的，我想也讀不大進道一頻的文章了。　　其中有一位作者說，現在想起林語堂的幽默詩句，「活像是投過了一次胎，另外又是一輩十似的」，我們現在讀「論語」，也有此感。那位作者說得好：「這世界有些不對了」。　　「讀諭語的人（已）不是當年那種心情」，就是我說我的胃口已變的說明。總而言之，我的胃口不好，我想多數讀者都未見得有好的胃口。　　這樣我就要回到題目上的問題來。「論語」究竟是好是壞？我說論語並不壞，祗是對於我們的胃口，它像是嫌淡了一點，戰前就有人嫌它太淡，現在這個不滿似乎普遍起來了。「論語」倘然要讀者讀好，編者應該加一點辣椒才是。送往迎來  孟龍　　明調人的文集「七條類稿」中，說到當時的御史，無才·無能·（或許還無行吧，）民間吃苦不小，一股怨恨之氣，完全發洩在民諺事面。民諺中，有一則如次：御史初到時，驚天動地；過幾月，昏天黑地；滾蛋時，寂天寞地。（大意如此，原句記不淸楚了·）　　時至今日，御史是沒有了，但是讀到這個俗諺，却很可能神經過敏地（但願這只是神經過敏！）想到它是在諷刺着現實！　　倉無餘糧，野無耕牛，這是一幅多麼嚴重的現實圖　！然而，貪者自貪，污者自污，他們不問現實，只顧自己。貪的去了，污的又來了，去來之間，人們照例亦送往迎來，熱鬧一番。不再是明朝那樣的寂天寞地了！　　難道他們早己準備好這一套好戲了嗎？首先是：歡天喜地；其次是：怨天恨地；最後一幕，便是謝天謝地的嗎？　　是的，這畢竟是一幕無言的戲劇罷了！試問：誰肯說？誰又敢說呢？三八之歌  姚蕙芬　　爲了丈夫跟兒女，　這原是苦難時代，　　總得做良母賢妻；　誰都不想做太太；　　爲了人家小實寶，　家庭職業兩副擔，　　還要當個小學敎。　一個肩兒挑起來。　　廿四小時工作喲，　聞道節日把頭抬，　　鐵打的也吃不消！　擒住眼淚向前看！　　（擬作山歌於卍慈小學）「丈夫回來了！」  余忘我畫影譚「藍橋殘夢」  伯寅　　好萊塢製片商以參與世界大戰（不論第一次或第二次）的退伍軍人同國復員後的失業苦悶爲題材的片子，自保羅茂尼的亡命者之後，繼起効允的眞是不勝枚舉。就故事的主要結構言，一藍橋殘夢」也是屬於道一類的，雖然劇作者的本意也許原是「旨不在此」。　　顯然，劇作者在道一個意義上是失敗了的，這不僅是由於他躱避了正面的問題，沒有把失榮的眞正原因社會的地揚露出來，同時也由於在編劇的技巧上，他所使用的片斷的倒叙把整個故事割裂得支離破碎的緣故。我們記淚」也是以劇中人的回憶來展開故事的，但以「藍橋殘夢」來比，那前者不僅緊湊，而且發展得自然多了。　　正如廣告上所說：結婚的意義不僅是愛情與歡笑，同時也包涵着麵包與白脫！如果劇作者眞能嚴肅地從這個觀點出發，在否定純美國式的戀愛至上主義這一點上，原也有其健全的意義，但是他並沒有這樣做。他好幾處都讓困於失業窘境中的皮爾「絕處逢生」了，同時，把漢克，這個上有老母下有子女的失業者寫成一個小丑樣的角色，這就足以說明作者對於飢寒交迫的失業者的一種看法。　　不過，「藍橋夢斷」也還有其可取之處，那便是整個戲的感情氣氛非常濃郁，也就在這一點上，使觀衆對於失業的威脅感到一種難於忍受的感情上的激動。皮爾因工廠裁員酗酒叵家，奸兒鐵梅因他失業而百般慰撫這幾塲戲都是够感動人的。　　導演的翰培利是成功的，他使整個戲自始至終控制在一種統一的氣氛之下，若干塲面與小動作的處理也很恰當，如大雨，橋頭的散步等，騙子都很美。藝文壇　　作家林煥平，因上海房屋發生糾葛，居住成了問題，不得已在一月前離滬返港，近則居住九讓。　　文藝出版社最近擬出文藝小　刋一套，內有范泉著報告集「記台灣的憤怒」，田濤著小說集「逃犯」，聞一多著詩論集「歌與詩」。　　范泉著永祥印書館總經售的「記合灣的憤怒」，今日出版，係自台灣民間與情追究此次暴動發生的眞相。內容奇警，說出了許多人想像不到的事情。　　莎翁名劇「柔密歐與　麗葉」，爲名劇作家曹禺氏翻譯，售缺已數月，現已由文化生活出版社第三版出書　　靳以之長篇巨著「前夕」，爲文化生活出版社印行，文長數十萬言，分上下二厚冊。抗戰時期曾於上海出版，尚未發行，即全都被敵人抄去。現由該社甫印，最近即可出書。　　黃嘉音主編之光聲誌第二十期三月號已出版，本

<h3>National Army Divides Forces to Cross the Songhua River; Fierce Battles on the Two Wings of Taolai Zhao; Small Bands of Communist Troops Harass Liaoning and Andong</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The Northeast war is drawing to a close. Part of the National Army in Jilin crossed the river towards the area east of Jiutai, and part went up the Songhua River, having crossed Baiqitun on the 6th and continuing north. Furthermore, the National Army on the south bank of the Songhua River has been crossing the river successively, but the main force has not yet moved.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Changchun dispatch on the 7th] The National Army crossed the river to sweep away the Communist troops. One route fiercely attacked Wujia Station on the 7th, with fierce battles raging from 9:00 AM. The Communist troops resisted stubbornly. Another route launched a long-range attack on Wukeshu. The Communist troops offered slight resistance, and around noon, a portion retreated. Sun Liren went to the front lines of Wukeshu at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th to command the troops. These two Communist strongholds north of the river will certainly be recovered, and Taolai Zhao can also be taken in short order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The war along the Songhua River has broken the silence of the past few days as the National Army crossed the river to pursue the enemy. The National Army from Shanghai was divided into two routes. One route advanced from the eastern side of the Middle-East Railway to attack Wukeshu on the north bank. This route was personally led by General Sun Liren, who crossed the river at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th and immediately engaged in skirmishes with the Communist troops on the north bank. Around 11:00 AM, the main force of the National Army arrived and, after destroying the strong defenses of the Communist troops, the vanguard approached Wukeshu. According to military sources here, the Communist troops there are putting up considerable resistance. The other route crossed the river from the western side of the Middle-East Railway on the morning of the 7th to capture Wujia Station, which was soon surrounded. Wukeshu and Wujia Station are parallel to each other northeast, arranged on the left and right of Taolai Zhao, becoming the satellite towns of Taolai Zhao. If the Communist troops lose these two places, Taolai Zhao will be isolated.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to reports from the military authorities here, a large number of Communist troops are gathered in Yushu County, northeast of Wukeshu. Fuyu northeast of Changtaoqian and south of Guancheng on the Changha Line are also occupied by Communist troops.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Changchun dispatch on the 7th] It is reported that Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist Third Army that attacked Dehui, was killed in action. According to eyewitnesses, Huang Kecheng's body was thickly coffined in a large red coffin and escorted north by more than ninety Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] Recently, the Northeast Communist troops have again been harassing the southern section of the Middle-East Railway with small detachments, attempting to contain the National Army north of the Songhua River, which is taking advantage of its victory to cross the river and suppress the remaining Communist forces. According to a report received by relevant authorities here on the afternoon of the 7th: (1) Wanjialing Station, 146 kilometers from Dalian, was harassed by Communist troops at dusk on the 6th, and a railway bridge at Majiadian to its south was blown up, cutting off traffic between Shenyang and Wafangdian. (2) Communist troops also harassed the vicinity of Kaiyuan Station, 105 kilometers north of Shenyang. Communist troops attacked Weiwu Village, 23 kilometers from Kaiyuan, on the night of the 6th. The local self-defense team fought bravely for several hours before retreating to Taipinggou, eight kilometers west of Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Military news: More than a thousand Communist troops attacked Tongliao City on the morning of the 5th. The defending troops fought bravely, and after a day of fierce fighting, they were finally overwhelmed due to the disparity in numbers. The Communist troops rushed in, and the defending troops broke through in a bloody battle. They then joined up with reinforcements on the morning of the 6th to launch a counterattack, which is still raging.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 7th] Military news: Communist troops invaded the southern county seat of Kaiyuan (the northernmost part of Andong Province) at 2:00 AM on the morning of the 5th. The local defending troops resisted for a long time but were eventually defeated.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Outskirts of Weixian; National Army Searches Ningyang Along the Jinpu Railway; Remnants of Liu Bocheng's Forces Cross the River and Flee to Liaocheng</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 7th] The war on the outskirts of Weixian continued fiercely yesterday and today. On the eastern side of the county, the National and Communist armies are still fiercely fighting at the Hamatun Railway Station. On the western side of the county, the Communist troops advancing from Yidu and Shouguang to harass Changle were repelled, but on the night of the 5th, they were reinforced and launched a siege. At Tianma, ten kilometers north of the county, and Tanjiabao, Baliguanzhuang, and Zhangjiayang to the west of the county, bloody battles continued until the evening of the 6th. As for the Communist troops heading south along the Weiye Highway, after being severely attacked by the National Army for several days, they were blocked at Qijiabu, ten kilometers northeast of the county, by the evening of the 6th, and the Communist troops suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 7th] The war on the outskirts of Qingdao, near Jiaoxian, is becoming increasingly intense. The Communist troops, who were besieging the city from the north and south, crossed the Madian Lao on the 6th. A portion of them, more than four thousand men with more than ten artillery pieces, launched a fierce attack on Jiaoxian Railway Station, Balizhuang to the north of the county, and Dagu River to the west of the county. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 7th, they were finally repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch on the 7th] The outskirts of Jinan are generally calm, but the war in the central and eastern sections of the Jiaoji Railway is becoming increasingly intense. The Communist troops are using a force of 170,000 men, distributed in the area from Weixian to the outskirts of Qingdao.

The Communist troops in Ningyang are showing signs of wavering.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Xuzhou dispatch on the 7th] More than 7,000 Communist troops gathered in the Xintai and Tai'an areas of central Shandong are currently moving south along the Yanzhou branch line, seemingly to reinforce Sishui and Xiangyang. Furthermore, due to a shortage of food, the Communist troops in Xintai have reduced their daily meals from two to one. Recently, the Communist troops have been freely looting from the people.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Xuzhou dispatch on the 7th] The 30,000 remaining men of the Communist Liu Bocheng's 127th, 667th, and other columns fled to the Feicheng and Dongping areas a week ago, intending to join forces with the remaining forces of Chen Yi in central Shandong, attempting to make a comeback. However, their morale is scattered, and they have lost their fighting ability. According to aerial reconnaissance, this group of Communist troops rolled up five large pontoon bridges on the Yellow River in the territory of Pingyin and Dong'a County on the 4th, secretly crossing the Yellow River overnight and fleeing to Zhuangping and Liaocheng for reorganization.</p>
<h3>Lincheng-Yanzhou Railway to Undergo Emergency Repairs Within Days</h3>

<p>Fierce Fighting in Huixian, Henan</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 7th] The Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway show signs of reorganizing their remnants and making a comeback. The fighting near Wanxian seems to have reached a stalemate. Wucunzhen has returned to the hands of the Communist troops. Nie Rongzhen convened a meeting of officers above the rank of regimental commander in the town on the 4th to give instructions. Nie's headquarters is currently stationed in Yueshan, 20 li north of Wanxian, with more than twenty vehicles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] After being recovered by the National Army, it is carrying out reconstruction work.

<h3>Third Plenary Session Will Discuss the Issue of Land Tax Collection in Kind</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] One of the main issues to be discussed at the Third Plenary Session is reportedly whether to continue the collection of land tax in kind and how to improve the collection methods.

<h3>Japanese Reparations Estimated at Ten Million Tons; China May Receive Thirty Percent</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] Regarding the amount of Japanese reparations, there are three estimates: the highest is 12 million tons, the next is 9 million tons, and the lowest is 7 million tons. China may receive 30% of the total amount. The United States has agreed to this, and it is reported that Britain is not opposed, but it must be approved by the Allied Council for Japan. The current problem is China's ability to utilize it.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th] Yun Zhen, representative of the Resources Committee in the United States and head of the receiving delegation in Japan, recently returned from Japan and hosted reporters today, saying: The Far Eastern Commission has designated all materials for Japanese reparations to the Allied countries, and China can receive 30% of the total. According to the initial reparations plan proposed by General Lay, thirteen types of Japanese materials, totaling 10 million tons, have been reserved for reparations. The first 30% will be shipped to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. China will receive half of it alone, and the other three countries will receive half of it together. China's wartime losses are no less than 30 million US dollars. Whether it can obtain full compensation depends on Japan's economic capacity. Regarding the reparations, the attitude of the United States is more generous than expected. Japan's heavy industry, especially arms factories, has long been dismantled and shipped to other Allied countries as compensation. There is no problem in transporting the reparations to China, but the cost is extremely difficult. If Japanese machinery is used properly, it will greatly help China's postwar reconstruction. Some of it was purchased from Germany and is still in good condition. The final reparations plan proposed by General Lay has been completed and submitted to President Truman for review. Differences of opinion among the Allied countries have hindered the smooth implementation of the reparations process.</p>

<h3>Planned Economy Plan is Extensive; Main Aim is to Revitalize the Countryside; Intended to Be Implemented First in the Yellow River Basin</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] At its routine meeting on the 6th, the National Defense Council discussed and approved the implementation of a planned economy. It is learned that the plan covers a very wide range of content, but its main aim is to formulate an economic plan that needs to be improved in light of China's current situation and in line with China's existing environment. This newspaper's reporter specially interviewed Xiao Zheng, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, to explain the meaning of the planned economy and its implementation methods. According to him, the plan has been decided to be handed over to the National Economic Commission for implementation. In the past, the government had drafted a five-year economic plan, but that plan was based on the general ideal of a normal state in which everything in the country had returned to peacetime. Heavy industry and various equipment were planned to be made with machines from foreign countries. Seeing that everything is still in turmoil today, it is naturally impossible to implement it as desired, so this plan was drafted. The core of this plan is to revitalize the rural economy, stimulate industrial construction, and improve the land policy in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. In the vast rural areas, small farmers' land is merged into standard farms in the form of cooperatives, and then to cooperative farms, implementing collective cultivation. Scientific methods are used to improve cultivation techniques, achieve mechanized farming, build water conservancy, and facilitate transportation. At the same time, the agricultural construction required to adopt a fixed order system, ordering goods from urban factories, so that industrial development and production will not be stagnant. Thus, the rural economy will prosper and industry can also develop. The plan is intended to be implemented first in the Yellow River Basin Pacification Zone in North China, starting with improving the newly recovered areas, and then expanding to the whole country.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The Economic Policy Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 7th. Wang Yunwu and Chen Lifu attended to discuss the implementation details of the economic measures plan.</p>
<p>Main Responsibilities of the National Economic Commission</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The main responsibilities of the National Economic Commission, which will decide and supervise important national economic policies, will be the following five: 1. Deciding on important economic policies; 2. Formulating economic plans and programs; 3. Fully utilizing resources; 4. Supervising specific economic measures; 5. Reviewing and linking the work of various economic departments. In addition to the chairman, the committee will have one secretary-general and two deputy secretaries. The heads of agencies such as the Ministry of Communications, Agriculture, Finance, Food, Social Affairs, Economy, Water, and Resources, the director of the Executive Headquarters, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, and the president of the National Bank will all be ex officio members. In addition, the President of the Executive Yuan will request the National Government to appoint ten to twenty members. The committee may also establish special committees when necessary.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] According to the economic emergency measures plan, all non-urgent expenditures in the budgets of various government departments this year should be postponed, and the Executive Yuan will consult with the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to properly formulate cleaning measures. It is reported that the Executive Yuan and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics have convened many meetings, but because the term "non-urgent need" is difficult to interpret, and each agency believes that its expenditures are all urgent routine matters, no agreement has yet been reached.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The draft "Implementation Measures for Wage Evaluation" has been drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and submitted to the Executive Yuan three days ago. It can be implemented in 30 designated locations across the country after approval. It is reported that the authorities do not intend to set up another evaluation organization, but will have the local social administrative agencies in charge handle the matter in coordination with local industrial and commercial groups. At the same time, the evaluation targets will be limited to certain designated occupations.</p>

<h3>Retired Military Officers Tilling the Northeast; A Great Plan is Being Actively Implemented; Retired Officers Are Required to Farm Themselves in Principle</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 7th] The great plan of retired military officers tilling the Northeast is now being actively implemented under the auspices of the Planning Department of the Northeast Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. Lieutenant General Gao Zijie, Director of the Reclamation Bureau, has arrived in Shenyang to discuss the handover of the reclamation area with relevant parties. There are more than 95.6 million mu of arable land in the Northeast, including more than 10 million mu of military land, which are also planned and utilized by the bureau. The bureau will also take over the Panshan Reclamation Area. This area was originally a Japanese immigrant reclamation area, adjacent to Yingkou, located on the right bank of the Liao River, and facing the Bohai Sea to the south. Initially, it was alkaline wasteland, but it was transformed into fertile land through Japanese soil improvement. It now has 124,000 mu of cultivated land (two-thirds of which are rice paddies and the rest are dry land), and about 256,000 mu of wasteland. The land is fertile and the harvest is abundant. The area has a network of railways and highways, a suitable climate, and well-equipped machinery, second only to the Tennessee Valley Authority reclamation area in the United States, run by Roosevelt. The bureau plans to use this reclamation area to pilot the allotment of land to retired officers for cultivation. It is estimated that there are four retired officer battalions from Beiping, Zhengzhou, Wuxi, and Jinan. The Reclamation Bureau has sent personnel to pick them up, and they are expected to arrive in the Northeast before the end of March. According to the bureau's plan, retired officers must cultivate the land themselves. The area of the land should be 100 mu of cultivated land or 200 mu of wasteland per household. Each retired officer is allowed to bring one or two assistants for cultivation. If they are unable to do so, they may apply to the bureau for approval to hire people to help, but they cannot rent or transfer the land. The reclamation area will distribute the original Japanese-built houses to the officers and their families, and will also issue the necessary furniture, cooking utensils, miscellaneous items, seeds, fertilizers, and livestock (including pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, etc.). The travel expenses for retired officers to go to the reclamation area will be provided by the state. After arrival, the first year's grain and family rations will be issued as usual, halved in the second year, and stopped in the third year. The agricultural operations in the reclamation area will adopt a cooperative approach, making full use of new agricultural implements and scientific methods. All transportation, water conservancy, culture, education, and other matters in the reclamation area will also be managed by the Reclamation Bureau. In addition, hospitals, elementary schools, libraries, clubs, agricultural and reclamation drama troupes, supply and consumption production credit cooperatives will be established to coordinate the education of children and the welfare of families, making it a paradise for veterans.</p>

<h3>Chen Zhi-ping Visits Quirino: Negotiations on Sino-Philippine Treaty May Resume</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 7th] Chen Zhi-ping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, met with Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino yesterday. The press believes that negotiations on the Sino-Philippine treaty may soon resume.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 6th] The Manila Chronicle criticized in an editorial today the "tough language" used by Chen Zhi-ping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, in the recent breakdown of treaty negotiations. It is said: "We learned from the Philippine government's reply to the Chinese embassy's note requesting the cessation of negotiations that the Chinese envoy used tough language, not only in the note but also in the envoy's last meeting with Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino. Mr. Chen seems to have abandoned diplomatic language and demanded the cessation of negotiations out of emotional impulse. Chinese diplomacy has always been known for its gentle language, even when pursuing tough policies. In this regard, Quirino seems to be more patient than Chen, because even though Chen made 'unreasonable' accusations, Quirino still expressed his willingness to continue negotiations in a friendly spirit in his reply."</p>

<h3>Japanese Young Man and Woman Commit Suicide in Air Raid Shelter in Beiping: Because of Poverty, They Cannot Return to Their Country to Get Married</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 7th] A Japanese young man and woman, due to poverty and helplessness, could not return to their country to get married, and committed suicide by agreement in a secluded place in Beiping yesterday. The woman was 21 years old and a nurse at a hospital in Zhangjiakou. She was beautiful. The man was 27 years old and had changed his surname to Zhu. The two fell in love at first sight in Zhangjiakou. The woman was once captured by the Communist army. Zhu wanted to commit suicide, but the woman escaped from the Communist army, and the two were reunited. They went to Beiping together and requested to be sent back to their country so that they could formally marry. Zhu recalled selling all his clothes to make a living, and had no money left for the trip back home. The two walked to an air-raid shelter near the city gate, hugged each other, and cried. They believed that only death could solve everything. Zhu handed a small knife to the woman, and she stabbed it into her heart without hesitation, but she did not die immediately. He wrapped a rope around the woman's neck and strangled her to death in pain. Then he stabbed himself with a knife. Zhu hanged himself with a rope, hoping to die together. When they were discovered by a coal scavenger, Zhu's eyes were already protruding. They were sent to the hospital for injections of cardiac stimulants. According to the doctor, there was hope for recovery. A torn letter was found near the air-raid shelter, which was addressed to the parents of the two, describing their hardship. There was also a small amount of hair inside the set. After Zhu woke up in the hospital, he repeatedly cried out "I failed her" because he could not die with the woman.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Commemorating Women's Day</h3>
<p>Women's Day comes and goes every year, so people naturally have many feelings about the arrival of this year's Women's Day. However, this year's Women's Day has a particularly profound meaning for us Chinese people and for Chinese women. We don't need to mention the history of women here, as someone will surely mention it on the many commemorative occasions of Women's Day today; what we want to point out is that with the arrival of Women's Day, we especially want to raise women's political awareness.</p>
<p>The so-called women's movement is actually the women's participation in politics movement, the women's participation in elections movement. This movement has its historical origins, but because the objective conditions of society were not mature, this movement only began to rise in the early 20th century. After the Second World War, even in France, the birthplace of modern democracy and also the most backward country in women's rights, there were constitutional provisions for women's participation in politics. It can be said that the goals hoped for by the early women's rights movement have now been largely achieved in political law. The so-called "bluestocking" group in the early days of the French Revolution would surely smile if they saw that today, in the national legislative bodies, such as the solemn parliament, there are also women representatives, and in the national government agencies, there are also female civil servants. Even in China, women's participation in politics has achieved considerable results. In today's highest national legislative and supervisory bodies, there are female members, and in the National Assembly, which recently completed the task of constitution-making, there are also our female representatives; moreover, in our constitution and other laws, the status of men and women is equal. It must be said that the so-called women's liberation movement has achieved considerable gains by this point.</p>
<p>But what we find regrettable is that the equality women have gained in law and politics is not necessarily equality in social status. Moreover, looking at some of the recent measures taken by governments in various places, it seems that they are creating or deepening the deterioration of women's status in society. Since the founding of the Republic of China, because many female comrades, such as Qiu Jin, participated in the early revolution, the practice of advocating prostitution has always been strictly prohibited, except in concessions under foreign influence and areas with particularly strong feudal forces; this was because of the importance attached to women's social status. However, in France, which has always allowed public prostitution while not allowing women to participate in politics, has changed its style by allowing women to participate in politics and banning public prostitution. Today, we see governments in various places encouraging and promoting public prostitution. Japan has also always allowed public prostitution, but now, under the rule of General MacArthur, it does not allow the existence of entertainment districts like Yoshiwara. France and Japan, which are backward in women's rights, no longer allow public prostitution, but we are promoting public prostitution today. Isn't this moving backwards? Today, we still want to advocate "strict separation between men and women." Isn't this moving backwards again? All of these are signs of disregarding women's social status. Today, with the arrival of Women's Day, we want to raise the awareness of our female compatriots about these discriminatory measures against women; what they should strive for is not the number of seats in the National Assembly or the Legislative Yuan, but rather discriminatory measures related to the status of women themselves.</p>
<p>Today, it is of particularly profound significance that we commemorate this Women's Day in China. Our country's fundamental law was formulated by the National Assembly last year, and this year will be the year of constitutional governance. The goals that the Chinese women's rights movement strived for in the early 20th century have now been achieved in China. We women across the country cherish this achievement and use all their strength to safeguard this precious constitution. The greatest significance of commemorating Women's Day today is that female compatriots across the country maintain this constitution with their actions.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Price Gouging</h3>
<p>The economic emergency measures plan is divided into six items, but its focus is actually on suppressing prices. Also announced at the same time were (1) banning the buying and selling of gold, (2) prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency, and (3) strengthening financial controls. Their direct and indirect effects are also nothing more than to suppress prices.</p>
<p>So, what kind of measures should be taken to suppress prices? Is it enough to just monitor, investigate strictly, detain, and prosecute? Are these measures applicable to any price control? And are these measures applicable unconditionally? If we study it further, it is not difficult to discover that there are many conditions and restrictions, which are not without room for consideration from a legal point of view.</p>
<p>First, Article 2 of Plan (4) states: All daily necessities in each designated area should be strictly priced and handled in accordance with the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and the Implementation Plan for Price Assessment. This has already clearly stated that (1) region, (2) type, (3) limit, and (4) certain procedures must be followed. At the same time, it is also stipulated that the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Emergency Periods and the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Emergency Periods should be strictly enforced. According to Article 1 of the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits, the so-called price limits are limited to daily necessities, except as stipulated in Article 8 of the National General Mobilization Law. Article 2 also clearly defines the conditions constituting the so-called violation, and Articles 3 and 5 designate the responsible authorities for this crackdown, which is the Bureau of Social Affairs in municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and the police bureau is responsible for investigation. And how to punish is listed in Article 6. This is the way to suppress prices that should be followed, which is originally stipulated very clearly. Moreover, the so-called assessment is not without standards. According to the Implementation Measures for Price Assessment, the Executive Yuan should first order the establishment of a Price Assessment Committee, and then the committee should decide on the types of goods to be assessed, which should be approved and announced by the local government. Then, the standard should be negotiated based on the cost of the goods and adding appropriate profits, and then implemented after being announced by the government. In other words, before the above procedures are completed, there is no so-called assessed price and violation of assessed price, let alone how to punish. Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities also stipulate that the areas, types, and names of all items to be cracked down on should be ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the local competent authorities to announce to the public within their jurisdictions in advance. Before the announcement is made, the hoarded items, whether they are from the same industry or not, may be reported and sold within a time limit. If they cannot be sold by the deadline, the government is allowed to sell them on their behalf or purchase them at a fair price. Therefore, even if there is hoarding behavior before the legal price assessment and announcement are implemented, it is not without room for flexibility. Because according to the current laws and regulations, what should be cracked down on is clearly designated as daily necessities, and important necessities, and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the police bureau are responsible for carrying out this crackdown. Only violations of assessed prices should be investigated and punished, and the work of reviewing assessed prices belongs to the Price Assessment Committee. As to whether the Assessment Committee should be organized, it should wait for the designation by the Executive Yuan, and the Bureau of Social Affairs is responsible for approving and announcing the assessed prices. Items hoarded before the announcement may be sold by themselves within a time limit or requested for purchase. Therefore, although these laws and regulations are mostly promulgated during non-emergency periods, they can be said to be well-organized, clearly layered, and consider all aspects of law, reason, and human feelings.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the emergency measures plan, the work of suppressing prices has been actively carried out, and a few hoarders have fallen into the legal net. It is their own fault that they speculate, hoard, and raise prices, but before the legal procedures are completed, they are probably still somewhat confused and do not know how to take legal paths to remedy the situation. This is indeed a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>According to these laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, the so-called suppressing prices is not a purely passive matter. For example, Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Measures for the Supply of Daily Necessities stipulates that the government may sell goods to regulate the market when necessary, and the industry should request government assistance when it encounters difficulties in funding, raw materials, power, and transportation. Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 17, 21, and 25 of the Emergency Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce stipulate that the Ministry of Economic Affairs should not only stipulate standards and urge improvement for specific enterprises or goods, but also invest, assist, purchase, take over management, or even nationalize and directly operate them when necessary. This is completely of a positive nature. The key to suppressing prices lies in increasing production, which cannot be achieved by simply cracking down, restricting, rationing, and punishing. Therefore, to truly suppress prices, both the fundamental and superficial aspects must be carried out simultaneously.</p>
<p>Now, the superficial aspects have been launched one after another. It seems that the fundamental aspects have not yet been noticed or implemented. We know very well that most of the above-mentioned laws and regulations are of a wartime nature, and many aspects may not be practical. However, there are also many that can be implemented. If only the parts related to cracking down and restrictions are cited, while the parts that support and promote are completely ignored, it would be taking things out of context and being too biased. Especially the preparatory work for the crackdown has not yet been completed, as if a few policemen can suppress prices. If it were really that easy, the trends of speculation, raising prices, hoarding, and cornering the market would not have survived to this day!</p>

<h3>Marshall Flies to Moscow, Bevin and Bidault Arrive at Soviet Border by Special Train</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 7th - Broadcast: US Secretary of State Marshall paid respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at 11 a.m. this morning (7 p.m. Shanghai time), and then flew from Paris at 1 p.m. (9 p.m. Shanghai time) to Berlin to meet with the US military occupation authorities, before flying to Moscow.</p>
<p>[United Press] Paris, 7th - US Secretary of State Marshall, passing through here yesterday, held talks with French President Auriol and Prime Minister Ramadier to review the friendly historical relations between the United States and France, but also exchanged views on the German peace treaty, such as the establishment of a German federation, the economic separation of the Ruhr region from Germany, and the management of the Rhineland region by the Allied occupation authorities, were discussed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Berlin, 7th - French Foreign Minister Bidault and his entourage left here by train at 7 p.m. last night for Moscow. British Foreign Secretary Bevin had previously traveled to the Soviet Union in another special train. Bevin made a brief statement to the press in Warsaw, saying that he hoped that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference would successfully resolve the German issue. "If I did not have this hope, I would not have traveled all the way to Moscow." The German issue has not yet been discussed by the four powers. Only the United Kingdom and France have exchanged views on this issue recently during talks. As for the issue of Poland's western border, he would not make any comments on it before the Four Foreign Ministers Conference discussed it. Foreign Secretary Bevin stayed in Warsaw for an hour before traveling to Moscow. The journey from the Soviet border is not far away.</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Moscow, 6th - As foreign guests began to arrive to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Moscow was suddenly hit by a heavy snowstorm today, the most severe of the winter, with temperatures dropping to five degrees.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Moscow, 7th - Special dispatch: The Moscow authorities have prepared to receive representatives from various countries coming here for the meeting. The four best hotels have been repainted, the specially designated rooms have been cleaned, the carpets have been changed, the lamps and doorknobs have been polished, and all kinds of glass ornaments have been washed. Elevator operators have been issued brand new uniforms with silver trim on their sleeves and collars. Each hotel is equipped with several English translators. Government vehicles have been allocated for the use of representatives from various countries. The first group of reporters and photographers has arrived, and the next group will arrive in the next two days. There are 20 British reporters and 36 American reporters. Bevin will travel by train from Calais via Berlin, Warsaw, and Brest-Litovsk, and then transfer to a Soviet train from there, and come to Moscow with the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union who will be there to meet him.</p>
<h3>Review of the Agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference: Disputes Will Inevitably Arise over Germany's Status and Borders; Regional Security Pacts Are Also on the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Washington News Agency] Berlin, 7th - Political observers here recently said that only the Austrian issue is fully prepared for a final resolution at the upcoming Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The agenda of this meeting can be divided into three main categories: (1) amending the current organization occupying Germany; (2) clarifying Germany's future status in the treaty; and (3) drafting a treaty to restore Austria's independence. Although the last item is expected to be resolved at the Moscow conference, its importance is self-evident, including guaranteeing Austria's independence and German property within Austria. Regarding guaranteeing Austria's independence, the only effective way is for Austria to sign this declaration, and other signatory countries of the peace treaty also need to guarantee it together. France has argued that additional guarantees should be added to prevent a recurrence of the situation in 1938. The United Kingdom's attitude is more reserved, unwilling to get involved in continental entanglements, but hopes that Austria and the Danube countries can be economically linked. The Soviet Union still opposes adding guarantees, believing that the guarantees of the United Nations Charter are sufficient. The Soviet Union's attitude is probably due to the fact that it would harm Yugoslavia's claims to Carinthia.</p>
<p>Secondly, the definition of the issue of German property in Austria still needs to be determined, such as whether the property confiscated in Austria after the German-Austrian merger should also be included in this category. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France all believe that the Soviet Union's proposed plan to eliminate the Nazis is enough to deprive Austria of the property necessary to restore its economic strength. Regarding Germany's current and future status, the four countries are still in contact, so the Moscow Conference will not be able to lay the foundation for a peace treaty immediately. Its future political status and border issues will inevitably become the subject of lengthy debates and may hinder the progress of negotiations. Even issues such as the occupying powers' administration of Germany, the elimination of Nazi elements, Germany's economic and financial institutions, and the establishment of a central government will also cause disputes over opinions. For example, on the issue of reparations, the Soviet Union wants to extract everything from Germany, while the United Kingdom and the United States want to restore its economic strength first and reduce the cost of the occupying forces before implementing the reparations plan. The differences between the two sides are great. It seems that the above issues cannot be easily resolved. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Marshall will take the opportunity to negotiate with the Soviet Union in Moscow to discuss temporary agreements on the spheres of influence of major powers in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific, and regional security pacts, such as the recent alliance treaty between the United Kingdom and France, which may be expanded into a four-nation pact.</p>
<h3>Peace Treaty Is Unfair, Refuse to Sign</h3>
<p>Words of the Leader of the German Social Democratic Party</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Rome, 7th - The leader of the German Social Democratic Party, Schumacher, recently stated to the Italian "Times" here that if the terms stipulated in the German peace treaty are too harsh, he will refuse to sign it. Germany is the same as other countries and does not want to be butchered. Some German nationalists are still dreaming of a Nazi-style "Greater Germany," and a group of conciliators hope to restore the borders of 1937, but those with national common sense hope that the eastern and western borders can allow Germany to survive, and that is enough. In terms of the final change of territory, merging land is the worst way to pay reparations. The country is willing to pay reparations, but first it must heal its wounds. Germany now only hopes to be allowed to participate in the Moscow Conference to jointly discuss the peace treaty, and the treaty can only be signed after a freely elected parliament representing the Central Government of the entire country is established.</p>
<h3>Panamanian Government Declares: Refuses to Ratify the Italian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press] Washington, 6th - The Panamanian Foreign Ministry issued a note to the four powers on the 6th, stating that the government refuses to ratify the Italian Peace Treaty because the Panamanian government believes that the treaty is too harsh. Panama supports the claims of Argentina and Uruguay and is working hard to ease the conditions.</p>
<h3>Fifty American Celebrities Offer Opinions on the German Issue: Suggest Five Points for Adoption</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] New York, 6th - A national conference was held here tonight to discuss the German issue, arguing that Germany must no longer be a military threat, but Germany's future economic situation should not be ignored. The following suggestions were then passed and submitted to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference: (1) Establish a civil affairs committee to manage Germany, so that it can become economically stable and develop a democratic government. (2) Recognize the demands of France and the Saar region for economic ties. (3) Recognize Poland's current western border. (4) Germany's inland river shipping should be kept internationally free. (5) Germany's coal, steel, and chemical plants should be jointly managed by a four-nation committee. This national conference was initiated by 50 celebrities, including Mrs. Roosevelt, former Secretary of State Welles, great scientist Einstein, and former Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.</p>
<h3>Truman Returns to the White House: Will Issue an Important Statement; Members of Congress Support Aid to Greece Policy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Washington, 7th - Observers here stated today that President Truman has taken a day off during his tour and returned to the White House to handle official business. Perhaps within 48 hours, he will issue another important statement on government policy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th - Broadcast: Senator Tom Connally recently gave a cautionary speech in the Senate, saying: "If the United States wants to obtain leadership in the Near East without a 'community of interests' as a basis, it will inevitably fail. We are now being asked to take over the land that Britain intends to abandon, but we should not inherit British policies, but must follow the inherent policies of the United States."</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Washington, 6th - Democratic Senator Barkley declared today after meeting with other Democratic senators that a majority of senators in the party supported lending to Greece to prevent the collapse of the current government. The Greek government's emergency request for assistance cannot be ignored. Barkley also said that, in his personal opinion, since Britain is no longer able to provide economic assistance to Greece, if the United States does not step in to replace it, the current Greek government will inevitably collapse. Democratic Senator McMahon said that the current struggle between the Communist Party and the anti-communist government in Greece is a major decision in American foreign policy that must be paid attention to. Such dangerous areas exist everywhere from Korea to Europe. Barkley also said that the amount of money to be lent to Greece has been set at 250 million US dollars, and this move is by no means anti-Soviet. If British troops withdraw from Greece, American troops will not go to replace them.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Seals Border with Turkey: Greek Army Will Launch a Full-Scale Attack on Guerrillas</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Istanbul, 7th - Bulgaria closed its border with Turkey yesterday, and nothing is allowed to pass except goods carried by trains. Observers here believe that Bulgaria has taken the same action on the border with Greece. Diplomatic circles say that the ban will last for ten days, and the reason may be military training, but it cannot be definitively said.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Athens, 7th - It is learned that the Greek army, navy, and air force will launch a full-scale offensive against the guerrillas in northern Greece between the 12th and 15th of this month. The navy and air force have sent officers to the Qilai area to join General Yage's headquarters. At the same time, warships and landing craft have also been concentrated on the sea surface in Thessaloniki and Kavala, waiting for orders. In addition, several air force teams are ordered to fly to northern Greece every day.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse] London, 6th - Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton recently stated in the House of Commons that the total cost borne by the United Kingdom in Greece and Palestine in the past two years is no less than 169 million pounds. In Greece, the United Kingdom spent 87 million pounds, of which 48 million pounds were used to maintain British troops, and the remaining part was used for the British promise to provide mutual assistance to Greece in 1945. In Palestine, the military expenditure was 72 million pounds.</p>

<p>[Associated Press] Lake Success, 7th - The Security Council met at 3 p.m. today to terminate the trusteeship of the former Japanese-mandated island of the Pacific Ocean and passed the United States' plan to occupy the island. The United States has full administrative and military control and can build secret military bases for the security of US national defense. The Soviet Union proposed three amendments, but they were all unimportant. The United Kingdom and Australia believe that the United States' actions seem to be too early and should wait for the completion of the peace treaty with Japan.</p>

<h3>France Purchases Military Equipment from the UK: Agreement Established Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] London, 6th - Official sources announced today that French military authorities have reached an agreement with the British War Office to purchase aircraft, guns, transport ships, and other materials to equip an airborne division of 16,000 men. However, spokesmen for the British Foreign Office and the French Embassy said that this agreement does not stipulate the standardization of military equipment between the United Kingdom and France. According to other official sources, Belgium also hopes to purchase some military equipment from the United Kingdom soon.</p>
<h3>French Prime Minister Talks About Policy Toward Vietnam</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Paris, 6th - French Prime Minister Ramadier said today: "We have made it clear before that the solution to the Vietnam issue cannot be forced upon us. We hope that the Viet Minh can understand this point. We have taken measures so that our efforts can be maintained as long as there is a need. France never intends to obstruct the national aspirations of the Vietnamese, and has no objection to the merger of Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin, but this unity should not benefit any one of them alone. I firmly believe that if we have a policy of understanding, we will be able to achieve the results currently brought about by military development. The policy we have adopted towards Vietnam has now entered a constructive stage." Ramadier also said: "Commissioner Bollaert still retains his command of all troops, and all military operations should be executed by the Commander-in-Chief under Bollaert's orders. The government's appointment of Bollaert to a position without Da Xiang Lilou's responsibilities is aimed at handing over the affairs of Vietnam to civil officials. As for the situation in various parts of Vietnam, Dongpu Village will obtain autonomy in the future and will be given full technical assistance by France. As for Laos, the problem is more complicated because the social organization of Laos is still in a semi-feudal state. In Cochinchina, the activities of the Viet Minh guerrillas have decreased, and we recognize that Cochinchina can establish its own government and are striving to give the Cochinchina government full freedom. The French Federation is built on the strength of ensuring the security of the entire Federation, and it is currently at a critical moment."</p>
<h3>Italy Experiences Red Rain</h3>

<h3>Prospects for World Relief Work After the End of UNRRA</h3>
<p>— Special Translation from Our Newspaper Compilation Room</p>
<p>The United States is currently planning a new international relief program that will strengthen the power of Britain and the United States in their struggle against the Soviet Union in Southern Europe. American food and other relief supplies can only be given to friendly countries that can prove they are truly in need. The majority of American relief supplies for 1947 will be shipped to Italy, Austria, and Greece. After the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) ends, governments that possess large armies or use food as a political weapon will no longer receive assistance from the United States.</p>
<p>This new US policy will be a major blow to the Soviet Union and its satellite states. These countries have already received assistance from UNRRA for reconstruction and development, totaling US$1.46 billion, which accounts for more than one-third of UNRRA's entire budget. Now, this vast flood is about to be reduced to a trickle. Even this trickle will not be shared by most countries within the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Behind the new US policy lies a contradiction: 72% of UNRRA relief supplies were provided by the United States, but the United States only has one vote on the UNRRA Central Committee, which is composed of nine countries and has the power to allocate relief supplies. The relief supplies provided by Britain, the United States, and Canada account for 95%, while the three countries only have one-third of the voting rights.</p>
<p>Last summer, a US plane was forced to land in Yugoslavia, causing an uproar within the country. However, during this period, the United States still had to transport relief supplies and machinery to Yugoslavia because of this contradictory fact. A similar incident occurred in Albania: while the country was shooting at British ships and expelling American diplomats, it continued to receive assistance from UNRRA.</p>
<p>Future Relief Work: Direct Negotiations Between Countries</p>
<p>The way in which world relief work is handled in 1947 will be different. After the end of UNRRA, relief work will be established on the basis of individual country-to-country relations. United Nations agencies will be able to assist in fact-finding and serve as a medium for consultation; that is, donor countries and recipient countries will negotiate directly, and United Nations agencies will only be responsible for providing advice and information.</p>
<p>The Economic and Financial Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has established a special committee composed of ten countries to determine which countries need assistance, how much assistance they need, and what they need. The committee's report is submitted to the member states of the United Nations, and then they consult on how to implement the relief plan.</p>
<p>UNRRA has already allocated relief supplies and equipment worth US$340 million to fifteen countries, which will be shipped out in succession to facilitate its closure. UNRRA hopes to complete the delivery of supplies to Europe by the end of March and to the East by the end of June. After that, it will close its doors.</p>
<p>The final meeting of the UNRRA Central Committee resolved to accept the US proposal to adjust the allocation of the final batch of relief supplies to ensure that the countries most in need receive the relief supplies when they need them most. All of UNRRA's current tasks, except for food supply, will be handled separately by several agencies belonging to the United Nations. Refugee relief work will be handled by the International Refugee Organization, which is in the process of being established. Agricultural reconstruction will be handled by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Disease assistance will be handled by the World Health Organization. Welfare work will be handled by the Social Committee. Industrial reconstruction is not a top priority and will be left to the countries themselves to handle. Countries that need additional assistance can request assistance from the World Bank.</p>
<p>The United States is Seeking to Conserve Funds; Appropriations Will Take Time</p>
<p>Those responsible for relief work, given UNRRA's hasty closure and the slow progress of the new agencies, are deeply concerned that the efforts will be a drop in the bucket and too slow to meet the urgent need. This question must be answered by the US Congress. The US State Department has no funds to provide relief to other countries and must request appropriations from Congress. The total amount of relief supplies needed by Europe in 1947 is estimated at US$400 million. The amount that the US State Department requests Congress to approve will probably not exceed half of that amount. The remaining amount will have to be supplemented by encouraging other countries (mainly Canada and Britain). (Translator's note: President Truman has already requested Congress to appropriate US$350 million to provide relief to the liberated countries.)</p>
<p>The US Congress is implementing austerity measures and may not be willing for the United States to spend more money to provide relief to other countries. In addition, whether Congress can act quickly is also a question. The next few months will be the most critical period. It will take time for this issue to be discussed in Congress, and it will take even longer for relief supplies to be delivered to the countries.</p>
<p>US officials are well aware that relief work will inevitably be delayed and acknowledge that countries have little hope of receiving direct assistance from the US government before the spring of 1947. During this transitional period, the United States can only place its hopes on other countries and UNRRA's final batch of relief supplies. Those who advocate that the United States allocate a large amount of money for foreign relief in 1947 may gain the sympathy of American farmers, who are worried that the mountains of surplus agricultural products will depress prices and harm farmers' interests.</p>
<p>In 1946, American agricultural production broke previous records. Unless a large amount of exports can be maintained in 1947, the United States will have a surplus of agricultural products, which will be enough to affect the current abundant income of farmers. The new relief plan that replaces UNRRA is a victory for the US State Department, or at least a partial failure for former UNRRA Director La Guardia.</p>
<p>Relief to the Soviet Union and Its Allies Will Cease</p>
<p>La Guardia argued that relief work must be placed under international control to prevent aid-giving countries from engaging in favoritism. The US State Department's response is: there will be no favoritism, and countries that possess large armies and use factories to manufacture weapons will not be supplied with food. This clearly refers to the Soviet Union and its satellite states.</p>
<p>The new relief plan is a compromise. The question of which countries need relief will be decided by a ten-nation (including the Soviet Union) special committee, but the United States is not bound by the committee's recommendations.</p>
<p>The countries that will receive American relief supplies in 1947 have generally been determined. The United States has already indicated that Italy and Austria will be the main countries to receive American relief supplies, with Greece coming in third. Poland and Hungary may also receive some assistance. According to the new policy, relief supplies to Albania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union will probably be stopped.</p>
<p>In the next six months, world relief work will encounter the greatest difficulties. After this period, the harvests of 1947 can be used to provide some sustenance. By 1948, governments may completely abandon international relief and allow private organizations to handle relief work. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")</p>
<h3>British Policy of Withdrawal from India Passed After Heated Debate in the Lower House; Churchill's Fierce Criticism Proves Ineffective</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] After two days of debate in the Lower House on the issue of India, the House last night rejected the opposition party's motion to refuse to accept the government's India policy by a vote of 337 to 185. Subsequently, the House passed the government's motion approving the government's policy of transferring power in India to Indians in June 1948.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Opposition leader Churchill spoke on the second day of the debate on India policy in the Lower House, suggesting that the India issue be submitted to the United Nations for resolution. Churchill said that since the government's India policy had failed, it would be reasonable and honorable to ask a larger organization for assistance. Churchill referred to the Indian government led by Nehru as a completely abnormal government, and that it was a major mistake to entrust the Indian government to Nehru. Churchill expressed regret that the government had failed to explain the reasons for the recall of Indian Governor Wavell. He also pointed out that India's political parties cannot represent the people, and that handing over the Indian government to this so-called political class is tantamount to transferring power to straw men, who will disappear without a trace in a few years.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Attlee Responds, Mocking Churchill</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] During the debate on India policy in the Lower House, Prime Minister Attlee responded to the debate on behalf of the government, stating that although he could not predict how India would develop in the future, he felt that Churchill's experience with the India issue was fifty years out of date. Regarding the resolution stipulating a deadline for returning power to Indians, he acknowledged that this deadline was indeed very short, but based on warnings from India, it was appropriate to set a definite deadline.</p>
<h3>Tojo Hospitalized Due to Illness</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Since the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal opened in April of last year, former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo was unable to attend the trial for the first time on the 7th due to bronchitis. According to official statements, Tojo was sent to the US military's 361st Hospital at 2:30 AM on the 7th due to bronchitis. His condition is not serious.</p>
<h3>New Party Established in Japan</h3>
<p>Kyodo Party and Kokumin Party Merge</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 7th] The Kyodo Democratic Party and the Kokumin Party held separate congresses yesterday and today, respectively, to approve the formation of a new party, the "Kokumin Kyodo Party", and issued a statement of establishment today. The inaugural meeting will be held tomorrow. A total of 78 members of parliament will participate in the new party. The new party will temporarily adopt a committee system without a party leader, with Miki Takeo (formerly of the Kyodo Democratic Party) as secretary-general and Okada Seiichi (formerly of the Kokumin Party) as chairman of the Central Standing Committee.</p>
<h3>French Fake Diplomat Sentenced; Brinon Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Brinon, the former Vichy "ambassador" to occupied France, was sentenced to death today by the Versailles court. Upon hearing the verdict, the defendant shouted, "Public opinion will judge after my death!"</p>
<h3>Too Many Generals, Too Few Soldiers in the US Military; Military Feels Difficulty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] A US Army officer said on the 6th that one of the difficulties for the US Army during peacetime is "too many generals, too few soldiers."</p>
<p>It is estimated that the current US Army has 1.07 million personnel, but there are as many as 10,590 colonels. During wartime, the Army had 8 million personnel, but only over 6,000 colonels. The current ratio of each colonel to soldiers is 1 to 65, while during wartime it was 1 to 755.</p>
<h3>Lewis's Contempt of Court Conviction Upheld by Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The US Supreme Court ruled today by a vote of 7 to 2 that United Mine Workers President John L. Lewis was guilty of contempt of court for refusing to comply with a federal court order to prevent a coal strike last November. This ruling is a great victory for President Truman in his struggle against Lewis and the union. The Supreme Court also approved the original sentence of Lewis being fined $10,000, but reduced the fine for the union from $3.5 million to $700,000. However, if the union carries out Lewis's threat to strike on April 1, the remaining $2.8 million will still be fined. Chief Justice Vinson's remarks during the sentencing were firm, stating that Lewis's contempt of the district court order was intentional. The union's ability to threaten the government and the welfare of the nation necessitates a large fine to demonstrate the seriousness of contempt of court. Lewis did not comment on the verdict, but the case is not over. Federal Judge Goldsborough will still hold a trial on whether Lewis has the right to cancel the wage contract between the union and the government. This trial has been delayed until now while awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling.</p>

<h3>Assembly Emphasizes Housing Shortage; Courts Should Pay Attention to Leasing Customs When Hearing Housing Disputes; Rent Issues to be Studied Jointly by Three Subcommittees; Construction Donation to be Discussed Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The second meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council continued to be held at its new site in Tanggu at 9:30 am yesterday for its ninth session. In the morning, 105 councilors were present, and in the afternoon, 96 councilors were present. The mayor and heads of various municipal government bureaus were also present. The agenda originally scheduled for the morning was to discuss unresolved cases, and in the afternoon, the tenth session was to discuss the issue of the municipal construction donation. However, as there were many proposals discussed yesterday related to regulations, land administration, society, finance, civil affairs, finance, public utilities, public works, and sanitation, the issue of construction donation and other temporary motions were postponed for discussion at today's meeting. The meeting venue was set up on the fourth floor, which had been newly painted in bright vermillion and azure colors, making it particularly magnificent. At 9:00 am, Chairman Pan announced the opening of the meeting. A total of 19 motions were passed, and 2 motions were withdrawn. During the meeting, the issue of housing rentals and convenience for councilors received the most attention, with heated debates. The mayor and heads of various bureaus repeatedly stood up to explain, creating a very tense atmosphere. The afternoon session was extended by one hour, adjourning at 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>Regarding housing and lease disputes, two motions were presented at yesterday's meeting. One was "Please the Municipal Government maintain the resolution of the first session of the Municipal Council, clearly ordering all landlords in the city not to arbitrarily increase rents to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people, and stipulating that landlords must not refuse to deduct the portion of property tax from the rent, please pass a resolution to send it to the Municipal Government for effective implementation." The other was "Please recommend that the judicial authorities maintain housing leases to alleviate the housing shortage and ensure social peace and tranquility."</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng felt that the review opinion of the second motion, "The Housing Lease Committee has been revoked, and this case is difficult to handle," was inappropriate. The severity of the housing shortage has not diminished to this day. Public school teachers and staff who have been allocated housing are often forced to move out because they have not paid the gold bar premium. When they sue in court, the court not only does not provide protection, but also turns a blind eye to the plight of the tenants. Although this council does not have the right to interfere with the judicial authorities, it hopes to stand on the side of the citizens and send a letter requesting the court to protect the tenants and not favor the owners. Jiang Pinglu said that in general, landlords also have no way to deal with tenants. Chairman Pan said that it could be recommended that the judicial authorities pay attention to the housing shortage situation in the city and pay special attention to the leasing customs of the city when hearing housing dispute cases.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then expressed his opinion, stating: Many houses in the neighborhoods are dirty and dilapidated because landlords are unable to afford the cost of repairs due to not increasing rents. However, increasing rents would increase the burden on tenants, so both sides face difficulties. As a result of the Municipal Government's considerations, it can only exempt newly built houses from rent restrictions in order to encourage house construction. In addition, it will request the China Trust Bureau to allocate 20 billion to build houses, but without results. Economic and price instability makes it difficult to find a reasonable solution, but treating it rigidly will turn it into a dead city. Although the Municipal Council can make recommendations to the court, the court cannot provide additional assistance outside of handling cases in accordance with the law. However, the practice of owners using premium fees should be strictly prohibited. Please the Municipal Council discuss together how to resolve it reasonably.</p>
<p>The case was combined with the first case for discussion in the afternoon. As a result, it was decided to submit it to the joint meeting of the Social, Legal, and Land Administration Committees for discussion and review. After the date of the joint meeting is scheduled, all councilors can participate in the discussion.</p>

<h3>Silver Shops and Others Submit Five Petitions</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] When the council held a meeting yesterday, there were several petitioners: (1) More than twenty members of the silver shop industry went to the meeting in the afternoon to petition against the government's gold jewelry processing measures promulgated on February 20: "Order all gold jewelry that has been manufactured to be registered within one week, and order it to be sold within March, otherwise it must be exchanged for national currency at the local central bank or its authorized bank", requesting amendments. Yan Gesheng and Zhu Yae, two councilors, received them and promised to submit them for discussion before forwarding them to the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, Xu Jiqing, Jiang Pingfan, and 48 others temporarily proposed: Please the Ministry of Finance quickly amend the gold jewelry processing measures to maintain the silver shop business and the livelihood of all employees. It is said that there are 250 silver shops in the city, employing no less than tens of thousands of people, whose livelihoods are on the verge of ruin. The government has not yet come up with a supplementary solution, which does not seem to be in line with the intention of caring for the difficulties of businesses and the livelihoods of all people. Therefore, it is proposed that the Ministry of Finance issue an order to abolish the regulations on time-limited registration, time-limited sales, and obtaining authorization letters in the exchange measures in the gold jewelry processing measures. In addition, please the Ministry of Finance, without hindering the principle of emergency economic processing measures, appropriately relax the scope of business for silver shops. For any major changes in regulations, the opinions of the silver shop industry must be sought in advance. In addition, there were also (2) a petition issued by all the employees of the horse carriage industry, requesting that horse carriage traffic be restored in the central district to reduce the congestion of trams and solve the livelihood of carriage drivers. (3) The rickshaw trade union expressed its opposition to the Municipal Government's collection of road maintenance fees. (4) Self-funded students requested that foreign exchange be calculated at 3350. (5) The catering industry requested that the starting point for the table tax apply to restaurants that serve noodles and have music equipment.</p>
<h3>Index Issue to be Discussed Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] City councilor Shui Xiangyun and others, in order to take into account the livelihoods of employees, suggested that the central government unfreeze the workers' cost of living index starting in April. However, according to reporters' inquiries with relevant municipal government personnel yesterday, it is said that this matter is difficult to achieve. Workers in the city are generally satisfied with the newly ordered additional subsidy of 73,000 yuan, so it is difficult to immediately request a change in policy at this time. However, how this case will be resolved will be discussed at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Establish a Wharf Warehouse District in the Southern City; Decided to Ask the Two Bureaus to First Conduct Detailed Planning</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Among the proposals discussed by the council yesterday, regarding the "Revitalizing the Southern City to Develop Port Affairs, Proposing to Establish a 'Wharf Warehouse District in the Southern City' in order to promote prosperity and facilitate shipping", the councilors also put forward their opinions. First, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue explained: Wharves and warehouses should be connected to facilitate the unloading and transportation of goods. The original intention is very correct. In the future, it is planned to move the tram tracks into Limalu (Inner Road), and the outer road will be the warehouse district, which will help to promote prosperity. Pudong will also be planned according to this principle. The reason for starting with the Southern City first is to create a model.</p>
<p>Qu Yue expressed his opposition to this, stating: If a warehouse district is built along Pudong, the area will become a dead zone. Therefore, if you want to demarcate a warehouse, it should be within the Southern Wharf, such as the Bansongyuan area, otherwise it will lock up the Southern City's market, and there will be no hope of restoring trams. Yang Guanbei said: The warehouse district does not mean canceling existing shops, but rather expanding the original wharves. The Southern City is a natural warehouse district, and the shops are all on Limalu. If the Southern City Wharf is not reorganized, it will never develop, and shops will not be added. Wang Bingquan also agreed with Yang Guanbei, saying that it is not easy to build a wharf warehouse district in the Southern City, and there will be many disputes. It would be better to ask the military agencies there to relocate for reconstruction. Finally, the council agreed with the chairman's opinion: "This case will be handed over to the Public Works and Public Utilities Bureaus for detailed planning, and then submitted to the joint meeting of the Public Works and Public Utilities Committees for review and submission to the third meeting of the council."</p>
<h3>Today is "March 8th" Women's Day; Two Commemorative Conferences</h3>

It is understood that Mr. Song plans to stay in Shanghai for a short period this time and does not intend to go elsewhere in the short term. It is also learned that the secretaries Zhu Guangshu, Jiang Jiping, Yin Zhongrong, and a group of more than ten people accompanied him on the same plane the day before.</p>
<h3>Haddon Garden, Family Temple Negligence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 0:03 this morning, a fire broke out in the family temple inside Haddon Garden at 926 Jing'an Temple Road. After the fire department dispatched vehicles to the scene to extinguish the fire, it was extinguished in about 45 minutes, with only a corner of the temple destroyed. The family temple was where Mrs. Haddon burned incense every day during her lifetime and housed several monks. Since Mrs. Haddon's death, it has lacked care, and the temple is in a state of disarray. Recently, many sundries have been piled up. Last night, sparks from the incense in the temple, due to careless cooking, were left behind, nearly causing a major disaster.</p>
<h3>Clearing Feces, Inviting Merchants to Contract, It Is Difficult for the Municipal Government to Manage Effectively, It Is Better to Contract with Merchants for More Revenue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the second general meeting of the Senate discussed many proposals, and the final discussion on the issue of handling feces sparked a war of words. Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei was severely criticized by the senators at the previous general meeting two months ago for the case of garbage trucks engaging in private malfeasance. Unfortunately, yesterday, he became the target of criticism again due to the feces issue.</p>
<p>Because the Health Committee of the Senate submitted a letter from the Municipal Government for review on "Inviting Merchants to Contract for Clearing Feces in This City," it was submitted to the general meeting for discussion yesterday. Lu Jingzhou advocated adopting merchant contracting for clearing feces, because it is beneficial to sanitation management on the one hand and can increase municipal revenue on the other. Qu agreed with this, but Jiang Huaisu, Jiang Hao, Wang Naixu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Lu Shidao, and others disagreed, all advocating that it should be handled by the Municipal Government itself. Why should merchants be allowed to profit and exploit, regarding feces as equivalent to ten thousand taels of gold?" As a result, Director Zhang was asked to report the reasons for wanting to invite merchants to contract. Director Zhang explained that this matter had been discussed ten times in the Sanitation and Cleaning Committee, and the result was that contracting with merchants was more economical, hygienic, and appropriate than handling it themselves. He personally also agreed in principle with handling it themselves, but regardless of whether it was handled by the Municipal Government or contracted with merchants, the "de-epidemic fermentation composting" method should be adopted. However, if the Municipal Government were to handle this institution, it would cost at least 200 billion yuan, which the Municipal Government cannot currently afford. As for contracting with merchants, the Municipal Government's monthly income would be at least 33 million and up to 460 million yuan. The bureau is currently planning to negotiate a draft contract with merchants, which also specifies that the scientific method of "de-epidemic fermentation composting" should be adopted. Recently, it is planned to invite experts in field feces to guide the handling of this new facility, but whether merchants can invest a large amount of money cannot be guaranteed. If the senators can come up with an appropriate solution, the bureau will do its best.</p>
<p>Wang Jian'e rose and stated, roughly saying that the cleaning problem is certainly important, but it is still unknown what the advantages and disadvantages of contracting with merchants are. Therefore, before clarifying the truth, he advocated handing it over to the competent authorities of the Municipal Government to study the situation and methods in detail before discussing it again.</p>
<p>At this point, Mayor Wu took the stage to speak, saying that he also agreed with the proposal to remove feces. However, because he had researched it extensively in the past, he found many shortcomings and currently has no remedies. After discussing with the Sanitation and Cleaning Committee, he still advocated contracting with merchants, but he felt that there were still imperfections. Therefore, he asked the general meeting to make a public decision. There are two reasons why the Municipal Government cannot achieve self-management: (1) The treatment of personnel is too low, so it is impossible to strengthen management, resulting in feces trucks leaking without anyone caring, and the loading and transportation are troublesome, so they are poured into the gutter, and even after investigation and punishment, it is useless. (2) If the Municipal Government manages it themselves, the current malpractices are more numerous than those of contractors. Contractors manage it as if every drop is gold, and the cleaning is thorough. In addition, the Municipal Government's income is also higher after contracting with merchants.</p>
<p>Finally, Speaker Pan stated: Clearing yellow feces was originally handled by the Municipal Government itself and was not approved by the Senate. Now the Municipal Government wants to change it to merchant management, which is changing its established methods on its own. Today, we can first vote. The result is that the majority supports the Municipal Government changing the current method (that is, contracting with merchants by the Municipal Government). At this point, many different opinions were raised on how to contract with merchants, but no results were achieved. In the end, only the principle of "contracting with merchants" was passed.</p>
<h3>Grain Loan Case Opens for Third Trial, Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu, Two Witnesses, Fail to Appear Due to Other Matters, Prosecutor Asks to Pay Attention to Whether There Are Any Defendants Who Can Be Saved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain loan case opened for the third time at the Changdi Court yesterday. The witnesses Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu, who were summoned, failed to appear because the Municipal Senate was in session. The prosecutor's argument stated roughly: If any of the eight defendants in this case have violated ordinary criminal regulations and are eligible for amnesty, please pay attention to the presiding judge and change the articles of indictment. However, regarding the first defendant, Wang Xunzhi, he leaked gold secrets when he was the deputy director of the National Treasury in Chongqing, which was related to the first gold rush. He also engaged in dereliction of duty and corruption while serving as the director of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in Hangzhou. Moreover, his methods of committing crimes were clever, so please pay special attention to the presiding judge. It was also said that the grain officials, including Da Ren, Ren Xingya, as the responsible personnel for grain loans, either attributed the major events in the case to orders from superiors or shifted responsibility to the grain merchants. Please, the presiding judge, severely punish them according to the law.</p>
<p>The statements of the eight defendants, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, Yang Run, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingya, were roughly the same as in the previous two trials. The interrogation of witness Shao Jigao also yielded no new discoveries. Wang Xunzhi made some corrections to the prosecutor's argument, stating roughly that the Chongqing gold rush occurred in 1944, but he had left the post of deputy director of the National Treasury as early as July 1943. The case of the Monopoly Bureau was also found to be a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Finally, the defense lawyers for Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Zhu Daren all requested that the defendants be released on bail, but the collegiate bench ruled to reject the request and returned them to custody.</p>

<h3>"Foreign Tiger" Investigation Completed, Transferred to the District Court Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Meisbo, the Dutch general manager of EBS Company, and Portuguese employee Babi Tiestai, who were engaged in large-scale black market trading of gold, US dollars, and foreign exchange, after being arrested by the Garrison Headquarters, the interrogation and investigation of the company's accounts have come to an end. The Inspection Office has scheduled to transfer the entire case to the District Court this morning, to be severely punished according to the law for disrupting the financial market and violating our country's emergency economic measures. According to relevant sources, regardless of the amount of gold and dollars EBS Company bought and sold before and after this gold rush, it is already disrupting the financial market and violating the emergency economic measures. Even in terms of its foreign exchange business, according to our country's laws, only the Central Bank and its designated banks have the right to buy and sell foreign exchange. EBS Company has not registered with the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Its nature is no different from that of an underground bank, which is illegal. Therefore, Meisbo's guilt is conclusive and he will have no way to escape.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bao Automobile Company Controls Traffic, Prosecutor Goes to Qibao to Examine Corpse, Driver of Company Car Beaten, Two Employees Detained and Interrogated According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Prosecutor Liang Gengsheng of the District Procuratorate, along with forensic doctor Jiang Ziwei, clerk Yang Shiqing, and others, went to Qishizhen in the suburbs yesterday morning to examine a corpse in a case. Because they needed the family of the deceased and local security guards to lead the way, in addition to the official car of the District Procuratorate in which Prosecutor Liang and others were riding, they hired a company car from Zhonghua Automobile Company for the security guards to ride in. The two cars arrived at Qishizhen at the same time around 11:00 AM. Unexpectedly, after getting off the car, Wang Guanlin, Bao Ruian, and others, employees of the Shanghai Bao Automobile Company in the area, gathered a crowd on the pretext to beat Chen Guoxiang, the driver of the Zhonghua Automobile Company, causing him injury. According to Prosecutor Liang's investigation with local residents, the Shanghai Bao Automobile Company has historically relied on local evil forces to control the traffic between Shanghai and Qibao, not allowing any taxi to enter. Even tourists from the city who ride bicycles are often obstructed, and beatings have occurred in the past. After hearing this, Prosecutor Liang was furious and decided to eliminate these local bullies to facilitate travel. He ordered the local security guards to take Wang Guanlin and Bao Ruian into custody and submitted a signed report to the chief prosecutor to file an indictment automatically. According to Wang and Bao's confession, the manager of the Shanghai Bao Automobile Company is named Wu Jianzhong. The District Procuratorate will summon him for investigation, and if there are any illegal facts, a public prosecution will be filed according to law.</p>
<h3>Two Traitor Cases Open Investigation Court, Wang Yongqing Claims to Be a Comrade Who Suffered, Han Weiwen Denies Colluding with Japanese Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court opened an investigation court yesterday to try two cases of suspected traitors. (1) Wang Yongqing was accused of serving in the Detective Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau during the enemy-puppet period. In July 1944, he was promoted to plainclothes police chief of the Judicial Section of the Putuo Road Police Branch Bureau and also served as the head of the French Concession Special Task Force of the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters. The case was tried in the High Court yesterday. Duan Zhenming, the deputy director of the Changshou Road Branch Bureau of the Police Bureau, testified that the defendant's service in a puppet position was true. Wang Yongqing claimed that he was a comrade who suffered. In February 1939, he was arrested by the enemy for transporting explosives for the National Salvation Army and imprisoned in Nanjing Prison. He asked to summon a Shanghai senator and Ma Yuanfang, who also suffered at the same time, to testify, and submitted a calligraphy scroll given to him by Ma Yuanfang in prison for the court's reference. (2) Han Weiwen, 62 years old, from Shanghai, was accused of serving as an inspector specialist in the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Construction Bureau after the fall of Shanghai, contacting Japanese bandits, and signing travel permits for passengers between Shanghai and Hangzhou, extorting them on the pretext, and accumulating a wealth of money. He was arrested by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command and sent to the High Court in this city. During yesterday's trial, the report firmly denied the two points in the indictment about "contacting Japanese bandits." Both cases need to be investigated, and the court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.</p>

<p>41 to 35 Victory by Six Points</p>
<p>American Soldiers Refuse to Accept Defeat, Rematch Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the friendly basketball match between China United and the U.S. Marine Corps Columbus, the five tigers of China United exhausted their efforts and fought hard for 40 minutes, finally defeating the American soldiers by a score of 41 to 35. In the first half, the American soldiers led by 22 to 21, a one-point advantage. Although it was a friendly match, fans knew that Columbus had strong power and tall stature, so the game was bound to be tense and exciting, so the city gymnasium was once again sold out. The score difference fluctuated between two or three points, and the competition was clear, fast, and not dragging, quite tense and exciting, and also China United's proud work of this session. The Columbus captain was hospitalized due to illness and did not appear, and the tallest soldier lost the commander-in-chief, inevitably reducing their strength. Because they refused to admit defeat, they decided to fight again on Sunday.</p>
<p>One Point Difference</p>
<p>The game started at 8:10. At 50 seconds, Columbus requested a timeout, which was a "tactic" to discuss countermeasures. Bruzzi made a free throw, and Ash scored, making it 3 to 0.

Columbus's tallest player made one of one free throw (Ash), making it 11 points, starting to exceed by one point. Zhen Zhong made a free throw, making it 11 to 11. "Drinking Water" Jun fiercely took the lead again with two points, and the score rose and fell rapidly, causing great tension. Xue Chong dribbled the ball inside and scored, making it 14 to 14 again. Wu Chengzhang made a free throw, adding one point. Ash added two points (China United 15, Columbus 16). At 15 minutes, Bao Songyuan sprinted in, making it 17 to 16. Columbus replaced Bruzzi with Lesma. In the first half, Columbus won by only one point, 22 to 21.</p>
<p>Outsmarting American Soldiers</p>
<p>The Columbus captain did not attend due to surgery for illness. No. 3 Cooper was an aircraft pilot. The doctor ordered him to rest, but he was fond of activity and took the stage despite his illness. At the beginning of the second half, Xue Chong broke the record, and Whiteford refused to accept it. Li Zhenzhong scored again, and China United was chasing out by 25 to 24. Bao scored, and at the same time, the opponent committed a foul. Xue Chong continued to make contributions, making it 29 to 25. China United led by as many as four points. Li passed to Xue Chong, stealing a "cold meal", making it 33 to 29. Columbus used a diversionary tactic. Cooper showed his power under the basket. "No. 13" the tallest Croening entered the game. Cooper played until it was tied at 33 to 33. Columbus set up the tallest formation. The "No. 13" fast car made its first move, which made people look at it with admiration. China United Chengzhang and Zhenzhong were unwilling to show weakness, and the foreign soldiers were still at a disadvantage with 37 to 35. In the last three minutes, Kong Guangyi unexpectedly stood out, making great contributions. Bao made a free throw, making it 41 to 35? China United adopted a delaying tactic until the end of the game.</p>

The Football Committee did not obtain the consent of the football team in advance, nor did it notify them, and changed the schedule without authorization, resulting in the team wasting time traveling back and forth. In addition, the Mayor's Cup competition has been going on since the beginning of February, and it has been going on for many days, but suddenly on the 6th of this month, it was announced that Article 22 of the Football Federation regulations did not apply to the Cup competition, causing the football teams to be at a loss. Moreover, changing the regulations halfway through is also not in compliance with the procedures. It is really regrettable that the Football Committee handles affairs sloppily.</p>

<p>Silk Industry Bank Table Tennis Team News</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank Table Tennis Team was recently established. On the evening of the 6th, it had a friendly match with the Bill Exchange Office Table Tennis Team. As a result, the Silk Industry Bank won by a narrow margin of 4-3. Among them, Chen Xingji's victory over Ma Jinliang from the Bill Exchange Office was the most exciting. The Silk Industry Bank has strong players such as Ye Xuebin and Chen Xingquan. In order to exchange skills, the team welcomes other teams to have friendly matches. Team leader is Zhu Shoumin, captain is Ye Xuebin, vice-captain is Chen Xingquan, officer is Zhang Yunhe, and members are Tang Weicheng, Zhu Banhou, Chen Pengcheng, Yuan Gongliang, Bi Houji, and Lu Jiale.</p>
<p>Basketball Sidelines</p>
<p>The game between China United and the US Navy Columbus, although it was a friendly match, was also a touchstone for China United's preparation for the League Championship this season. The City Gymnasium was once again sold out, and more than 2,000 spectators watched attentively the best performance of China United this season.</p>
<p>The two teams were always in a hard fight. China United's net win of three goals was the largest difference in the whole game (China United once made it 33-26 in the second half, but was immediately forced to 33 each).</p>
<p>This game increased the confidence of China United in the future game against the Marine Corps Youth, but it is not appropriate to "learn from" it, because it is not easy to judge the advantages and disadvantages of the playing styles of Columbus and the Marine Corps Youth. Columbus is a more average team in all aspects, while the Marine Corps Youth uses a tall player of six feet four inches as the main general for offense and defense, which is a bit deformed. The Columbus team defends better than it attacks, and its shooting technique is below that of the Marine Corps Youth.</p>
<p>Last night, China United used Da Li, Adi, Xue Chong, Lao Bao and Kong Guangyi. The new lineup was indeed not weak. Lao Kong's passing to the other four, although not very coordinated, was very stable in controlling the ball. In the game against the Marine Corps Youth, Da Li and Lao Bao may have been fouled out five times to prevent the tall Wan Luke. Lao Kong is the ideal replacement.</p>
<p>To deal with tall players, the League knew that it had adopted low passing in yesterday's game, which proved effective. It can be seen that the tactics used by the League last night were implicitly aimed at dealing with the Marine Corps Youth. (Chang Nian)</p>

<p>Government Decides to Export One-Tenth of Yarn Produced by Each Factory to Earn Hong Kong Exchange</p>
<p>Selling Remaining Cotton Yarn to Obtain Hong Kong Exchange, Monthly Supply of 2,000 Pieces</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, regarding the Hong Kong government's request to our government to allow the export of cotton yarn to Hong Kong, and the Spinning and Weaving Control Commission's approval to sell cotton yarn, relevant parties went to Hong Kong to negotiate, and have already signed an agreement with the Hong Kong government to temporarily supply and sell 2,000 pieces per month. The first batch of 2,000 pieces has already been shipped a few days ago. It is learned that the price of yarn agreed upon by the Hong Kong government and us is based on the delivery price of HK$1,500 per piece of standard yarn with a certain count. Other counts are calculated proportionally. The types of cotton yarn are to be determined by us at our discretion, and the Hong Kong government is not allowed to choose. The Hong Kong government must also guarantee that the cotton yarn purchased will not be used for smuggling or disrupting the yarn market. According to estimates by the Hong Kong manufacturing industry, Hong Kong's monthly demand for cotton yarn is 5,000 to 10,000 pieces. However, the actual demand should not exceed 4,000 pieces. Economically, Hong Kong relies on us. Moreover, most of the manufacturing industries in Hong Kong are operated by overseas Chinese. Therefore, exporting cotton yarn to Hong Kong also implies helping overseas Chinese. Due to the shortage of cotton yarn in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government previously ordered cotton yarn from Japan, and two batches, totaling 11,000 pieces, arrived in January of this year. The delivery price of the 20-count standard yarn of that batch of Japanese goods was pseudo-HK$1,200 per piece. After arriving in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government resold it to the manufacturing industry at a price of HK$1,600 per piece. Now that Chinese yarn has arrived in Shanghai, it will also be resold at the same price. It is learned that in order to obtain foreign exchange, the government has decided to supply one-tenth of the total yarn produced by Shanghai's yarn factories for export. It is estimated that the total value of yarn, cloth, and other cotton textiles exported by China this year can be exchanged for approximately US$75 million. This is a major contribution of the textile industry to China's foreign exchange resources.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Hong Kong, 7th] The Hong Kong Department of Industry and Commerce announced on the 7th that it has ordered 200,000 bales of cotton yarn from the China Textile Corporation, which will soon be shipped to Hong Kong. This cotton yarn will be sold to various textile factories here at a preferential price. It is said that the department has signed a 16-month contract with the Chinese government, but it seems that the date of the purchase has not yet been decided. This is the first time since the war that a large amount of cotton yarn has been purchased from China.</p>
<p>Savings Deposits Collected by Various Banks and Bureaus</p>
<p>Allowed to be Invested in Purchasing Stocks</p>
<p>Stocks are also Allowed to be Used as Deposit Guarantee</p>
<p>The head office of the Bank of Communications previously petitioned the Ministry of Finance to ask whether savings deposits collected by various banks and bureaus could be invested in purchasing stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and whether the stocks could be used as security for savings deposits. It is now learned that the Bank of Communications has received a letter from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the investment of savings deposits in purchasing stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange by various banks and bureaus is in compliance with Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Savings Bank Law and Article 5 of the Savings Regulations for National Savings. It can be handled accordingly, but it should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Savings Bank Law. As for the use of the above-mentioned stocks as security for savings deposits, it is also in compliance with the provisions of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, and the price should be calculated at 50% of the market price at the time of deposit. After reporting to the joint board meeting of the four banks for approval, the Bank of Communications has notified various banks and bureaus accordingly.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Do Not Break Out of Consolidation</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially declined and then rebounded yesterday, without breaking out of consolidation. Rubber stocks were still being absorbed by Jewish merchants, and Chengfu was still strong. Huidejian was firm and consistent. Yisha's low price was 18,000 yuan and the high price was 19,400 yuan. After rising, there was consolidation. As a result, steel and rubber stocks were flat compared to the previous closing, while the rest rose slightly, up to half a weak percent.</p>
<p>Bond Market Gradually Stabilizes</p>
<p>There were still no widespread transactions in public bonds yesterday. People's hearts have gradually stabilized. After initially declining, they gradually rose. Class A and B bonds started from 5,200 yuan, Class C bonds started from 7,700 yuan, Class D bonds started from 5,600 yuan, and Unification E bonds started from 5,800 yuan. All ended with high-priced buying orders. As a result, each recovered by about 500 yuan compared to the previous closing, with transactions of only a few hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Transactions are Few</p>
<p>Yarn market transactions were sparse and prices were flat yesterday. Customers have not yet taken action, and there is a possibility of decline. However, because the yarn value is only equivalent to the cost of yarn factories, yarn factories are unwilling to sell more, and the Spinning and Weaving Construction Commission only distributes one or two pieces to each household. People in the industry are unwilling to sell cheaply because it is not easy to replenish, resulting in a stalemate in market prices. There are not many transactions on the market, and most can abide by the price limit.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the China Spinning and Weaving Construction Corporation sold a total of 1,421 pieces of yarn on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Control Commission yesterday, including 1,070 pieces from yarn factories and 351 pieces from trading houses. There were a total of 1,011 applicants, including 704 yarn factories and 307 trading houses.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry Applies to Purchase Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Limited to Own Needs</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Spinning and Weaving Control Commission recently replied to the Manufacturing Industry Association: In the future, the industry's purchase of cotton yarn should be limited to its own needs. If it applies to purchase yarn that is not needed by itself, it will not only not be allocated, but the applicant will also be suspected of hoarding. In addition, the yarn purchased by the industry in the future must not be resold on the market, and it will be corrected if discovered.</p>
<p>Many People Seek to Sell Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Prices are Lower Than Previous Days</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market situation yesterday was that at the beginning of the morning, due to the close supervision of the Jingjian Group, people were very worried, and many who held goods were anxious to sell. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 159,000 yuan, which was reduced to 156,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Chinese-made Dyeing and Weaving Factory frequently favored 20-count extra-fine cloth, and some people in the industry bought it at low prices, so the Longtou fine cloth finally rose to 158,000 yuan, which was 2,000 yuan less than the previous day. Wufu was 154,000 yuan, and Lanji was 152,000 yuan, which was 2,000 to 4,000 yuan less. The bleached cloth market did not move, and it was stable. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth were both stable.</p>
<p>Rayon Prices Rebound Higher</p>
<p>Rayon rebounded and rose again yesterday, because silk merchants' distribution of silk was not enough to meet demand, and they scrambled to absorb it from the black market, resulting in higher asking prices. The highest asking price for 120-count Kosan Yuguang was 7.4 million yuan. Receipts for 300,000 yuan in the morning were traded at 200,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The factory silk market was quiet, with no transactions. Qian Jing bought ten units from the Meiya Silk Factory yesterday, and the price was 5.65 million to 5.7 million yuan. Due to sluggish actual sales of silk goods, the market was mostly tired and fell yesterday. Dachang quilt was sold for 3.8 million yuan, and plaid was asked for 17,000 yuan, but there were no transactions, and the situation in the market was unusually deserted.</p>
<p>Quality of Our Country's Export Tea Must Be Excellent</p>
<p>Yesterday, a tea exporter said: Tea leaves, which occupy an important position in the international market, although it has been almost two years since the victory, exports have not been continuous because the domestic and foreign selling prices are very different. And most of the products exported in recent years are some old teas that have been stored for many years, taking advantage of their relatively low prices. However, overseas customers have repeatedly called, mentioning that the Chinese tea that arrived there, except for a few that were of good quality and have now been sold out, the rest are still shelved due to their strong moldy smell. Looking at this situation, if Chinese tea merchants do not wake up in the future, the long-standing reputation of Chinese tea in the international market may gradually be lost.</p>
<p>Export of Green Tea is Active</p>
<p>The domestic tea market was still in a hibernation state yesterday, and the market situation was stable. As for foreign merchants' transactions, Zhenmei and Zhenmei green teas are still active and prosperous, and the market is consistently stable. Wuchang Tea Company and Huacha Company have adopted a policy of not refusing those with reasonable prices. In addition, for black tea that Yingzhuang is paying attention to, most of the cargo owners who are eager for funds are still selling, but the buyers are cutting prices sharply. The sellers are concerned about the cost, so they are reluctant to depreciate too much. After negotiations between the two parties, they have returned to a stalemate, and the market situation is quiet.</p>
<p>Jing Rice Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 10,800 stones of rice arrived in the north and south, and the store's sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand. Jing rice was extremely sluggish, with few buyers, and both northern and southern Jing rice continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan trends were stable, and Xian rice was also stable.</p>
<p>Flour digestion was cold, falling 300 to 500 yuan, and iron skin continued to be tired by 300 to 500 yuan, and the situation still tended to be weak. Soybean cake in Shantou moved slightly, and continued to increase by 300 to 500 yuan. Yellow soybeans went away and the end of the year was active, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market distributed a total of 700 loads of soybean oil, distributed to the suburbs of Shanghai and the Pudong New Area, a total of 241 households, at a price of 250,000 yuan. However, the market situation was very strong due to the store's sales being very strong, and the raw oil added another 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, the clear oil rose by 10,000 yuan, and the sesame oil also increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung beans' sales saw a solution, falling 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, red beans were tired by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the Southeast Asian trend was not strong. Corn continued to fall, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, red sorghum was weak, raw peanuts were flat, sesame seeds were firm, with a slight increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, broad beans' zero sales turned around, tired and re-recovered, rebounding by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and the price of various grains saw a mixture of rises and falls.</p>
<p>Fresh Meat Prices Surge</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of fresh meat rose sharply in the market yesterday, from 320,000 yuan to 390,000 yuan per market load. In addition, each market catty of ribs was 5,000 yuan, and each market catty of spareribs was 4,000 yuan, which were both about 1,000 yuan higher than the previous day. According to people in the industry, the number of pigs arriving from the source has decreased recently, and the price of raw pigs in the producing areas has also risen due to the rise in food prices.</p>
<p>China Farmers Bank Convenes Representatives of Silk Merchants</p>
<p>Discussing the Spring Cocoon Purchase Plan</p>
<p>Manufacturers Express Joint Cocoon Collection by Region</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to promote this year's spring cocoon purchase plan and discuss the development of the entire silk industry, the China Farmers Bank specially invited responsible persons from 17 silk factories to talk yesterday. Wang Botian, manager of the Farmers Bank, Zhou Jiyao, deputy manager, etc., were present. Manufacturers included Wang Huanan, Xue Zukang, Song Baolin, etc. The Farmers Bank stated: (1) The issue of loan management during cocoon collection. It is quite difficult. How should it be handled in order to manage it strictly and reduce costs? (2) Last year, the government provided assistance to silk cocoon production with a low interest rate of 2%, one to solve the livelihood of silkworm farmers, and two to obtain foreign exchange for cranes for export. Now that the first goal has been achieved, the second goal needs to be strengthened this year. (3) The Farmers Bank's concern is to look forward to the price of silk cocoons, and domestic sales will still be higher than foreign sales. Therefore, it is feared that most of the silk produced this year will be below grade D. Regarding the first point of the Farmers Bank's opinion, various manufacturers stated that joint cocoon collection should be carried out by region in order to facilitate management, mutual supervision, and reduce costs. Regarding the manufacturers' opinions, the Farmers Bank stated: (1) Several units should be organized and coordinated closely. (2) The distribution should be expedited after cocoon collection to reduce costs.</p>
<p>Although the Buying Style of Popular Stocks is Still Strong, the Trading of Yong Yarn is Still the Most</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market did not break out of consolidation yesterday. Popular stocks continued to advance under the widespread buying style. The market initially appeared strong in the afternoon, but the sharp momentum soon declined. Some large investors seemed to have a tendency to rework water yarn.</p>

Nos. 4, 224, 84, 145, 152, 178, 89, 13, 15, 76, and 22 were successively absorbed. Lian'an, cement, Zhongsi, Xinguang, Jinglun, and Xinhua gradually forced the price to rise to the limit and gradually raised it. After 11:30, the price rose to 2,870 yuan, and Nos. 85, 203, 91, and 61 took the opportunity to sell, retreating to 2,810 yuan. However, Nos. 223, 3, 218, 12, 145, 95, and 32 all absorbed together, and the closing price in the afternoon was still hovering at a high level. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the price of Yong Yarn and Zhongfa rose by about 10%, the price of Meiya Quanxing rose by more than 5%, the prices of Xinhao and Huafeng Xinguang each rose by less than 15%, the price of Xinhua rose to the limit, the price of De Yong Yarn increased slightly, the price of Meiya rose by more than 5%, and the prices of Xinhao, Huafeng, Xinguang and Jingfu each rose by 10% to less than 15%.

At this time, Zhongsi, underwear, Xinhua, Lian'an, and Xinguang successively rose to the limit. People's hearts were still showing, Nos. 144 and 141 and others were in, and it was easy to rise back to the 2,900 yuan scene. After 3 o'clock, the popular stocks said that the momentum had greatly decreased, and the situation gradually showed relaxation. Nos. 85, 152, 223, 76, and 99 continued to supply and sell, forcing the price down to 2,780 yuan.
