<h3>暹羅我僑胞米商請放寬糧食統制</h3>

<h3>我國應配暹羅米三萬噸尚未運華</h3>

<h3>我鐵鑛輸日明年二月啓運</h3>

<p>本年關稅收入超過預算二倍半强</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕三十六年關稅收入超出預算，據財政部關務署之統計，截至十二月上旬止，共征起一萬九千五百餘億元，估計全年收入可達二萬二千五百餘億元，比原核定之預算數六千三百零四億元，超收一萬六千一百餘億元，增加二倍半强。自三月間輸入管制辦法實施後，進口貨品有限額，若干不必需品禁止進口，影響稅收甚大，關稅尚未達戰前佔全國稅收第一位之地位，但今年之稅收數目，僅次於貨物稅之收入，而佔全國稅收之第二位。</p>

<p>美國援華計劃國會可望批准主持計劃人選未決定</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿九日民〕高級官員廿九日告合眾社稱：魏德邁將軍並未被提及充任將來主持美國援華計劃之職務，同時亦並未在考慮中。至於討論及決定由何人主持此一計劃，在援華計劃提交國會前不致發生，各方暗示援華計劃將予批准。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京卅日電〕關於美國務卿馬歇爾所稱正在草擬中之準備向明年一月美國會提出之援華計劃，此間中美官方尚無所聞。謹言該計劃可望包括經濟與軍事兩方面之援助。此間美大使館尚未與中國政府有所商談談，同時中國駐華盛頓大使館有所討論。中國外交部與國防部對此亦一無所悉。此間若干方面認為，美國務院在草擬一重要之援華計劃時，而不與南京之美使惐中國外交部有所接觸，實為「異乎尋常」，或許馬歇爾認為渠目前所有之各項資料已足够應付矣。上星期行政院長張羣接見合眾社記者時曾謂，華盛頓中國使館與美政府之間，曾在討論援華問題，然是否關於馬歇爾所謂之長期計劃抑或國會最近通過之一千八百萬臨時計劃，尚無所知。</p>

<h3>除夕話同情</h3>
<p>——論學生募捐救濟難民運動</p>
<p>民國三十六年的大除夕，今天已到了眼前。在這時世艱難的當兒，那些有幸福安坐在家裏慶祝團圓的人們，於燈紅酒綠的氛圍中，如果想到天寒歲暮，還有一大羣飢寒交迫的同胞仰待援手，只要良知尙未汩沒，一定會激發起天生的同情心的。我們但看這幾天來，青年學生們的為難民而奔走呼號，更可信人同此心，心同此理，眞所謂「惻隱之心，人皆有之！」</p>
<p>今年上海市的多令救濟，十月間市政府早呼　於前，市參議會決議籌募辦法於後，社會各界即繼之而有多令救濟委員會的嚴密組織，推動以來，顯已具有成效。聞預定六百億的救濟經費，因各方的熱忱和辦法的妥善，不難於短期內如數募足。按照原定計劃，辦工賬，辦施粥，發寒衣，設庇寒所，一件一件的辦起來，本市亟待救濟的二十萬難民，一定可以得到勉渡難關的安慰。這眞是本市今年的一件特別大事，值得在除夕結帳的時候大書特書得。</p>
<p>在街頭，在住宅，在酒樓飯店，在機關團體，進來到處都有三五成羣學生的蹤跡。他們手執小旗，帶着「救飢救寒」的符號，伸出手來，向市民募寒衣，募現鈔。他們有靈敏的感覺，所以對於市政府救濟難民共走，立刻能接受，能響應。在社會上尙未普遍發動之前，他們的活動就迅速的展開了。他們不待別人去勸導，不待別人的督促，而立即自動的從事工作。他們有赤誠的同情心，所以他們看見難民的飢餓，有如自身的飢餓；看見難民的寒冷，有如自身的寒冷；看見難民露宿街頭，無床無被，多少人於一夜之間即變成僵屍，就再也不能安住在自己的宿舍而不出來對難民一加援手。這些成千萬的難民，來自匪區，受盡「鬥爭」，「清算」，「屠殺」之苦。在共匪的「三光」政策之下，這羣被害者，正是和許多學生們自己故鄉的父老兄弟受到同樣的遭遇。這激發了青年學生的同情心，救濟難民，彷彿就是救濟自己。二十八日，在體育館舉行得獎的清寒學生聯歡大會席上，兩千多同學，慷慨的捐出了他們每人應得的二萬元的點心費，準備送給冬令救濟會，轉發難民。當時此義一出，掌聲雷動。只有窮人才眞了解窮人；清寒學生救濟難民，這正是最高同情心的表現。中國人民往往被人看為殘忍而自私的民族，往往被人拿「各人自掃門前雪，不管他家瓦上霜」二語作為中國人民自私的寫照。本來在十年來內憂外患，殺人如麻的情形下，有時不免使人神經麻木，缺乏急公好義的英力精神；然而這究竟只是一時的，偶然的現象，不能據以說明中國的民族性。上海冬令救濟運動的蓬蓬勃勃，青年學生所表現的舍己為人的精神，都是給此種謬見一個有力的反駁。</p>
<p>由於各校學生同時在各地發動，所以募捐運動相當普遍，同時影響也會很深刻。市民大家起來了，響應並支持這個運動，募捐的成績可能有優良的表現。主持救濟的人，可能受到青年們的鼓勵而更努力，迅速而確實的工作，使市民所捐出的現鈔和物品，涓滴歸公，用之於難民身上。至於成千成萬的難民，當然身受其惠，引為慰藉，而使在救濟過程中所發生不必要的麻煩——如難民不顯入庇寒所，假難民的乘機漁利，以及或有藉募捐的美名而實則自肥的無賴，——可以减少和克服。</p>
<p>對於學生的救濟難民運動，在人類同情心的意義上，我們不但無可非議，而且應該予以鼓勵。但是為求眞正能救濟難民，而减少意外的流弊起見，我們願意對各團體的勸募工作，貢獻關於技術上的三點意見：</p>
<p>第一，我們的救濟運動，必須統一於冬令救濟會。冬令救濟委員會是負責主持此次救濟工作的綜合性的社會團體。包括着上海全市各界，有勸募，有發放，有稽核，並且有會計師的查帳報告，可以微信。任何團體應該和該會取得密切的聯絡，並受牠的指導。任何團體的募捐册，不管是募物資還是捐現鈔，應該從冬令救濟會領來；所捐的東西，除該會另有規定者外，也應該繳給該會，統辦發放工作。這樣作，有兩個好處：　所募得和發出的東西，可以絕對有所稽考。這種大都市裏，在募捐的過程中，往往難免流弊。我們不忍見學生募捐一片清白的熱忱，有時或因辦理疏忽而灌受不白之冤。假如各團體的勸募工作一切統一於救濟會，則此類可能的錯誤可以避免。　任何團體所募得的東西悉交於救濟會，則分配給難民時，自可平均分配，適合需要，不致有重複備枯之弊，而假冒難民，混水摸魚者，也勢必知所歛跡。</p>
<p>第二，募捐必須分區分發。本市各學校多位於北區和西區，設各就近募捐，或無計劃的　入市區募捐，均不勉有些地方大家去募，有些地方大家沒有去募，這不僅足以影響募捐的成績，而且使幾次彼募者反而感覺麻煩，不曾被募者，又覺得有東西還不會捐得出去。日前市長在記者招待會席上，主張徵募寒衣，應該分區徵募，分區配發，這是一個很好的決定，我們應該照這樣做做去。</p>
<p>第三，勸募措詞，應純正簡單；勸募方法，尤當力避苛擾。本來，這「救飢救寒」是出發於人類同情心的，良知良能，一觸即發，用不着嘮叨大篇的演說。而尤其須注意的，中國人樂善好施者的心理，但求應受佈施者獲益，施者即可得到安慰。萬不可一面向人捐募，而一面則說對於蘇北原有地主流為難民的這種說法，最足阻碍勸募工作之進行。我們今天只問其是否為難民，而不能問其過去的景况。昔日的小小地主，今天為共匪「鬥爭」到一乾二淨的，難道說就不是難民？至於　路募捐，沿門索款，一而再，再而三，這一班去，那一羣來，募者無窮，應者有限，豈不將令一般市民都有苛擾之感？樂捐則可，苛捐則不可！和平的捐款則可，騷擾的捐款則不可！</p>
<p>學生是以讀書為第一義的。此番被同情心所激動，走出校門，從事勸募救濟，殊可稱許。然而寒假將屆，大考已臨，學生們的勸募工作，其勢不能持久。我們希望由於此次學生的熱心募捐，能激勵市民更廣大更深刻的同情，而繼續此項救濟工作，直至達到預期的目標為止。天寒地凍，急景凋年，我們謹為成千成萬的難民，向樂善好施的人們呼籲！</p>
<h3>孫越崎抵滬</h3>
<p>暢談東北工礦等問題</p>
<p>將返京報告視察經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕資委會副主委孫越崎，週前視察東北工礦事畢，已於昨日下午四時半自平飛返抵滬，日內即返京報告。據孫氏稱　陳兼主任對東北工礦要地，皆駐有重兵，雖目前瀋陽情勢頗緊，但各工礦仍照常生產，亦未作任何撤退準備，蓋戡亂與抗議不同，實不可作移地生產計也。惟東北各工礦因動力燃料不足，多未能充分生產，如鞍山鋼鐵廠，本年本有輸出鋼鐵廿萬噸之計劃，惟五月中旬以後，此項工作，即漸趨停滯。革北方面環境較東北為安定，各工礦正積極增强生產，更無他　計劃。　日本賠債物資，首此工作母機九千餘部，約計四千噸，下月初經濟部即派船赴日接運，此項機械已大致分配妥當，　由經濟部售民營工廠者二千五百部，國防部三千部，資　　交通部各五百部，敎育部五百部。　前中印油管本有移裝玉門油礦之議，惟因慮及該油管太薄，工作壽命僅二年，過去已使用一年餘，如再移裝，已無價值，故爾作罷。　我國鈾鑛，廣西，瀋陽南大石橋，包頭北大青山軍有之，惟當前以我國工業科學情形，尙難　乎開採，美國擬組空中鈾礦探測隊來華事，本人尙無所悉。　資委會已允蔣石景山鋼鐵廠　電機歸還上海華商電氣公司，並以即將田美運到之五千基羅瓦特電機補充。</p>
<h3>對學生自治會規則</h3>
<p>敎部發言人談話</p>
<p>認某報抨擊實為不當</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕據敎部發言人稱：本部此次修正學生自治會規則，其積極意義，劉參事英士已發表談話，（按即本報昨載敎育當局談話），卄九日某報社評抨擊該項規則，謂本部防閑學生活動，按學生如不利用其身份從事非法活動，本部並無防閑之意，相反地青年愛國觀念與服務精神，正為本部所注意培養，遠在民十九年，中央即有學生自治會組織大綱之頒佈，廿四年以後停止實施，嗣敎部認為自治會可訓練學生學習民主，於卅二年復訂頒學生自治會規則，本年以行憲在即，原規則間有不合時宜之處，例如原規則規定，當處之理事須呈報其是否黨員或團員，乃以代表大會代替會員大會等，均有修正必要，乃予以修正，某報所舉不得參加校外各種團體活動，本為原規則第二條所載，並非此次增刊，蓋學生自治會為學生之組織，學生之身份實從學校得來，離開學校即非學生，如准自治會參加校外團體活動，即與普通民衆團體無異，應由社部主管，而其寧則亦不應由本部制訂。關於學生自治會應由學校當局負責指導，及以促進德，智，體，　四　為目的，暨設學　，健康，服務，風紀，事務五部等節，均為原規則所明定，且已行之多章，而某報指為目前新創之條文，遽加論評，是其對於過去及現行敎育法令，似未認眞查考，僅憑手頭材料，以意推揣，作為迎合青年之論。至學生自治會職員應選操作學業成績確屬優良而有頒導能力者任之一節，某報當不主張學行　劣者當選為任何職員也。宗旨，青年應因勢力導，亦應訓練其學習，故不應過分放任，倘於在校之時即縱其習於把持操縱，不守紀律，不尊重他人，順己則喜，逆己則惡，養成習性，將來入身社會，不更將顛倒是非，淆亂黑白，而益增社會之亂源，如此敎育成為何種敎育，恐將更為某報所深惡耳。</p>

<h3>華萊士以獨立候選人資格宣布參加總統競選發表演說攻擊美現行政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社芝加哥廿九日電〕美國前副總統華萊士今夜向全國發表廣播演說，聲明「余以獨立候選人資格參加一九四八年度總統競選」。華氏稱：「今日有比較從前更大之威脅，其嚴重性實為人類史上所未有。此種威脅可用新的政治陣容加以克服，新政治陣容需要新政黨之組織，本人爰宣布將以獨立候選人資格，參加明年美國總統競選」。</p>
<p>華氏並宣布政綱稱，「全國普遍軍訓乃趨向法西斯主義之第一步，吾人將盡力向之鬥爭，並將與贊同此舉之全體議員從事鬥爭。新黨必須實行朝氣蓬勃之富足與安全計劃，而非貧乏與戰爭計劃。吾人如能以籌備戰爭之同樣廣大範圍，籌備和平，即可防止經濟衰落與戰爭。美國無數人民曾請余從事此種偉大之鬥爭。一九四八年度投和平票者愈多，則世界將更加切實明瞭美國並不擁護兩黨一致之反動的主戰政策，此種政策正分裂世界成為兩個武裝兵營，將來不免使美國軍人穿着寒帶服裝橫倒於蘇聯雪地」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社支加哥廿九日電〕美前副總統華來士加入總統競選，中立政治觀察家認為此舉主要結果，將大為减弱杜魯門總統再度當選之機會，華萊士攻擊對華以及對希士軍事援助，係促成美國國內物價高潮之原因。渠稱：美國人民業已讀及報上載有國會通過荒謬之撥款，供在希土作軍事冒險之用，以及數十億之撥款，供美國國內武裝之用，此事逐漸使吾人瞭然，該種新聞紙上之大標題，業已成為吾人日常生活之一部。吾人突然了解吾人不能使世界人民從事下次大戰，而必須在吾人日常生活中，少享受食糧衣着及住居之便利等代價。</p>
<p>〔聯合社芝加哥廿九日電〕華萊士現年五十九歲，俄亥俄州人，初為共和黨員，但一九二八年曾擁護民主黨史密斯，一九三二年曾擁護故總統羅斯福競選。華氏在羅斯福總統最初兩任內任農長，旋在羅斯福第三任內前後任總統及商長。一九四六年因公反對前國務卿貝爾納斯之對蘇强硬政策，被杜魯門罷黜。</p>
<h3>華萊士參加競選後杜魯門感受威脅民主黨政治機構呈動搖</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅日電〕華萊士決定參加競選總統後，杜魯門總統連任之希望大受打擊。華氏擬在工業區為華氏努力，而杜魯門則不能失去工業區選票。華氏擬在紐約州，加州，伊里諾州競選，此三州在全國區選票中佔九十票，按總統之當選僅需二百六十六票。然羅斯福之新政派並不全部支持華萊士，工會方面亦不表擁護，至今為華氏後盾者僅共產及伊里諾進步兩黨而已。然華氏並不希望明年當選，葢高瞻遠矚意在一九五二年。　　〔聯合社芝加哥卅日電〕前副總統華來士昨日聲明將以獨立候選人資格參加明年總統競選後，民主黨政治機構顯已因此動搖。據政界人士聲稱，華氏旣曾抨擊所謂「兩黨反動的作戰政策」，民主共和兩黨總統候選人在競選時勢必提出答覆。</p>
<h3>華萊士辭去共和週報主筆</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿九日電〕華萊士辭去新共和週報主筆之職後，將繼續為該週報之特約作者，每週撰文一頁。聞華氏辭職之前，新共和雜誌之主編海爾，就華氏之未來地位與該雜誌發行人史屈萊發生意見，亦已辭職。</p>
<h3>民主黨仍支持杜魯門連任</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅日電〕此間一般估計，過去十二個月中，杜魯門明年當選之機會日益進步，此項轉變，部份由於美人對於外交政策表示滿意，明年十一月二日選舉之結果，在共和黨推出其候選人前，尚不能逆料。然杜魯門顯然已掌握民主黨被推為候選人，殆無疑問。一九四七年前，參議兩院選舉民主黨所擊敗之共和黨，一般以為後者之優勢可維持至一九四八年，杜氏之政治展望異常悲觀。在國會之敵視下，杜氏贏得馬歇爾之協助，推行人民愛戴之外交政策。國內政策上，則否決國會之法案與共和黨決鬥，其他各事，亦以爭取民心為第一。杜氏與墨西哥，加拿大及巴西進一步修好，重整西半球聯防，以杜魯門主義及馬歇爾計劃應付歐洲，美國人民感覺對蘇政策已趨「强硬」，兩黨亦均支持「防共行動」。</p>
<h3>米契爾放棄王位羅宣布為共和國政權完全受共產黨控制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十日廣播：據羅馬尼亞來訊稱，羅馬尼亞國王米契爾已於星期一宣佈退位，由共產黨控制之內閣立宣佈羅馬尼亞為一「人民民主共和國」。米契爾曾發表廣播演說，聲稱渠為民眾之利益而放棄王位，良以局勢之改變，已使憲法之修正成為必要，人民必須有選擇其自己政府形式之權利。內閣全體閣員均簽字於宣佈羅馬尼亞共和國之宣言，議會正在開會，以便加以批准。據悉，米契爾與瑞士之安娜公主發生愛情後，曾要求格魯柴政府加以核准，惟遭格氏拒絕，因羅國共黨顯不願米契爾與他國之王族結婚。羅王之退位，其主因大致在此。眾信米契爾不久將與安娜公主宣佈訂婚矣。</p>
<h3>德賠償問題英美交換意見　蘇區首批物資分配十國</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕英美不久就美國擬停止自德西部供給對蘇賠償物資之事交換意見。英國雖不致影響華盛頓關於此事之決議，惟料貝文外相當仍以渠於外長會議失敗復在下院所發表之聲明為凖，即英國當繼續撥付英國區之賠償物資。美國雖未請英國改變其立塲，惟以英美區之經濟政策旣已處於合作程度，兩國之就賠償問題採取不同之政策，自宜先由雙方政府成立諒解。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕法外交部宣布：白魯塞爾盟國賠償會已將波茨坦協定規定下應作賠償之　批德境美其名曰出門，分配於英·法·美·荷·比·希·捷·南·埃·印等十國，計有黍米一萬噸，汽油三千噸，柴油五千噸及木材等。</p>
<h3>英美在華府協商應付希局勢</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦三十日電〕英外部發言人稱：英美兩國對希臘局熱正在華盛頓進行「正式性質」之談判，據稱，此次華盛頓談判，可能促使英國重新考慮其政策，葢希臘眷戀益趨嚴重，已引起倫敦官方之深慮也。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿九日電〕此間可靠方面息：希北之反叛政府，若獲得任何外國政府之承認，則希臘可以立即獲得外界軍事援助以資自衛，若聯合國憲章第五十一條所規定乾。英美希三國政府正從事積極協商，企圖防止反叛政府之被外國承認，彼等認為此項承認，將為趨向擴大衝突之第一重大步驟。希臘將認外國之承認希反叛政府，等於希從事武裝侵略。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿九日電〕聯合國巴爾幹委員會今日通過決議案，聲言任何外國政府承認希臘遊擊隊司令馬柯斯領導之政府，將為對於國際和平及安全之威脅。財政委員會今日宣稱，法國明年擬擴軍為三十二萬三千八百人，即較本年增加三萬九千二百人。全部軍費料將超過二千八百億法郎，約合美金廿三億五千萬元。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕內長莫許今日在國會宣稱，本人現已拒絕以汽油　給予共黨，葢國家有自衛之權。其他各黨則均獲得汽油配給。</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅日電〕白宮宣佈定於廿九日由總統簽字之反通貨膨脹法案原文突然神秘失踪。廿六日晚杜魯門對該法案痛加指斥後，廿九日正待時乃遍尋不得。白宮方面立即命令密探着手偵查。同時又命令準備副本使總統在卅一日午夜前簽字。目前該副本已送交參院議長范登堡與眾院議長馬丁簽字。</p>
<p>美將以電視術作為競選工具</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿九日電〕RCA無綫電公司董事長兼總經理薩諾甫今日發表年終報告，預測無綫電傳眞將在一九四八年總統選舉中占重要地位。據稱兩黨以此種新工具競選者至少有二十一州，共占全國選票總數三分之二以上，大選以前電視術必有切實發展，較諸廣播對於政治革命性影響更大。</p>

<h3>蘇伊關係惡化顯有絕交之可能</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉廿九日電〕此間「共和報」認為蘇聯及伊朗間之外交關係，將告斷絕，葢蘇伊關係日益惡化，而伊朗決無法滿足蘇聯之要求。「素描報」稱，哈基米在蘇聯威脅下，又出任伊朗總理一事，使蘇聯大感失望。該報並認為共產國際刻所施之顛覆性行動，包括在希臘成立傀儡政府，可稱為繼法義大罷工後之第二次國際共黨攻勢。伊朗政府在哈基米領導下，對蘇聯之兼併，仍保持一貫之抵抗。</p>
<h3>漢特森赴緬英派員訓練緬軍</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕英航空部長漢特森，今日乘飛機赴仰光，參加一月四日緬甸之獨立慶祝紀念。</p>

<h3>片山向人民廣播決心建立民主抵抗共產謂日欲求復原至少需時五十年</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京卅日電〕日首相片山哲頃於其新文告中，向日本人民保證，渠將與共產主義奮鬥到底，並將努力驅逐日本之資本主義，而建立一民主社會主義之武器，據片山稱，民主社會主義亦不容許資本主義與其並存。繼稱，日本欲自戰爭破壞中求得復原，為時至少須五十年。渠鼓勵日本人民在尋求外國援助之前，應先求自助。中國先哲有言，「天助自動者」，片山對保守分子口號所謂「保守黨乃擊敗共黨之惟一組織」加以駁斥，並謂新保守黨制服共黨之企圖，乃緣木求魚。片山最後警告日本人不可懷戀旣往戰勝者之光榮，而應承認日本業已全部敗北之事實。</p>
<h3>西班牙可能列入美援歐範圍</h3>
<p>〔路透社駐華盛頓廿九日電〕此權威人士稱，關於倫敦報紙所傳英美法三國外長業已同意使西班牙參加馬歇爾援歐方案之說，雖不能加以證實，但事實上並無理由不使西班牙參加。惟必須首先由參加馬歇爾方案之歐洲十六國接受西班牙之參加，並由西班牙保證決定參加復興歐陸之共同努力。此間人士認為有更多具有可信任直盯過完國家參加歐洲復興計劃，即可使該計劃有更多之成功希望。西班牙如參加歐洲復興計劃，其貢獻以及其收穫必同樣重大，由於西班牙與其他大部份國家之政治關係，雖似不致由外界向西班牙建議參加馬歇爾方案，然西班牙之政治哲學，在美國目光中並不較中歐某兩三國更為可厭，而美國對此某兩三國固已表示希望其參加歐洲復興計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社馬德里廿九日電〕此間有資望之觀察家相信，最近法美兩國之動亂，以及聯大會之決定不就西班牙問題採取任何行動，已使弗朗　將軍在國內之地位，大為增强。</p>

<h3>美海外顧問公司十二專家飛抵滬視察水電化工紡織各廠工業協會舉行酒會歡迎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國海外大顧問公司的專家一行十二人及女四人，我國賠償歸還委員會聯絡官一人，昨午一時半由東京飛抵滬。海外顧問公司，係美國紐約和新英格蘭三十位工程師和專家所組成，受美陸軍部和國務院的委托，調查日本賠償問題和研究如何復興日本經濟，在團長史瑞克率領之下，他們自今年八月起即留駐日本，四個月的調查工作，使他們已有充分資料向下出報告和建議。這些建議是很有分量的，它將影響美國對日本賠償問題的整個態度。</p>
<p>昨天他們將取道華南經過菲律賓和珍珠港返國。但是他們亦附帶有個使命，就是要順使看看中國的工業，是否有吸收日本賠償物資的能力，所以他們的觀察，對我們的國家利益太有關係了。這十二位客人中，包括電力專家，鋼鐵心家，造船專家，化學專家，煤鐵礦專家在內，有一位還是遠在東委員會下分配委員會的主席。</p>
<p>午餐之後·分組視察</p>
<p>領隊人是美國已退休的共和鋼鐵公司的總裁維塞氏（R.J.Wysor），他在鋼鐵界供職四十三年之久，除了蘇聯之外，對於世界任何國家的鋼鐵情形，都相當的明瞭。他們一行人員昨晨八時自東京起飛，一時半到達上海，在賠償委員會招待午餐之後，立即分組視察。其中一組參觀閘北水電公司，另外一組視察天原化工廠，第三組訪問申新第九廠，第四組是一批女士們，她們參觀了大上海的市容，也許是很感興趣吧！雞尾酒會也遲到了。</p>
<p>日本復興·速度不快</p>
<p>晚間五時半至七時半，工業協會在西摩路榮鴻元家中舉行雞尾酒會歡迎。被邀者除吳市長·　潘議長之外，尚有鋼鐵·電力·化工·石油·機械·造船·交通·紡織·　金融界等知名之士六十人左右。空氣很是融洽。維塞氏對上海的態度似乎不差，說這裏的一切活動，比他所預期的要好得多。談到日本的復興速度，他連連搖頭說並不快，原因是煤荒，而煤荒是世界性的。</p>
<p>今日清晨·乘車晋京</p>
<p>這批客人定今日清晨乘車赴京。將和翁文灝氏有一個重要談話。除夕他們將晝夜專訪滬，元旦的上午，全體將參觀中央造船公司和張華浜碼頭。他們短促的訪問就這樣的結果，午後如果有時間的話，也許要跑幾家公司和店舖，領敎一下上海的物價。二日清晨如果天氣良好，專機將把他們帶到香港，轉道返美。這幾位客人對中國工業的印象如何？本身的主張如何？都是一個未知之數。維塞氏說得清楚：「我個人對此沒有意見可發表，我們的報告將在返美後方才起草，提恰美政府作參考」。這也是唯一能得到的答覆。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕王德雲（即王小弟），周養庭，王兆梅等三人，因貪汚罪嫌，昨經地檢處提起公訴。據起訴書略稱：王德雲之姊係顧卓祥（即顧樾仙）之繼母，顧在台灣空軍指揮部任軍需職，於本年九月中旬，奉命往京領得軍服呢多件，託由王德雲寄存於本市大來華記南貨行內，旋於九月下旬，顧串同王德雲同往該行內，私將上項軍服呢二捆取去，由王設法售賣，并交付顧法幣二千餘萬元。嗣輕台灣空軍指揮部查悉，將顧卓祥羈押，顧遂畏罪自戕，由該指揮部電知空軍供應司令部，轉請本市法院派警往捕共犯王德雲時，王德雲之父王兆與周養庭共同將王德雲藏匿，并由周養庭出具無王小弟其人之證明書，交由法警帶院，以圖朦蔽。嗣經地檢處將王德雲拘獲，予以收押。該案經地檢處偵查後，以該被告所為，依懲治貪汚條例第一條第一項後段之規定，實有共犯同條例第三條第一項第二款之罪嫌，其侵占軍服呢，并依同條例第七條之規定，予以追繳或追征。至被告王兆梅·周養庭之所為，顯有共犯刑法第一百六十四條第一項前段之罪嫌，依法提起公訴。</p>

<p>錢江通航前夕　一個可喜的展望  本報特派員　儲裕生　　〔本報杭州廿九日訊〕杭州這個都市，在不久以後，即將躍居重要的地位了，這就因爲浙贛路的全綫通車，和錢塘江的通航。自從錢塘江海塘工程局成立以來，第一步把海潮拒於海塘八里以外，第二步穩定河床，第三步錢江要通航了。這實在是浙江的一個喜訊，也是東南乃至全國的一個量號的喜訊，錢塘江的通航，老早被一般人所計劃到了，遠在民國十八年西湖博覽會時，南洋勸榮會曾有輪船一艘，自上海循錢江駛至杭州，但屢次幾乎遭到擱淺的危險。從此一般人不再敢書試通航。直到三十六年一月　一日，行總的「潘恩號（Pine）由上海駛到了杭州，接着「脫格號」（Tugger）於是年是月廿四日也由范駛杭，這才又重新激起了人們對錢塘江通航的興趣。由於海塘工程局對穩固河床和　水歸流的不斷努力，當年八月廿一日，木駁二十只由行總水運大隊派八號拖輪自滬拖至乍浦，再由脫格號接回杭州，其中包括木駁三只，鐵駁一只，內裝小汽艇二隻。　　海塘工程局再度利用挑水　，使水不致流散，其結果，在潮汎小的時候。　　錢江水位　　距河床有六公尺，最淺的塔山附近（即誤稱　子門處）也有二公尺的永位。我們根據富陽海寗各縣水位統計其低水位有負的地方，河床的負數更加倍，因此只要吃水在二公尺以下的船，就可通航。現在一條五千噸的船，須吃水二四英呎，一條三百噸的船，須吃水五十一英呎。如此，三百噸的船，可以即刻通航，已無問題。五千噸的船待高水位時也可以通航了。三千噸的船只要把水床總續穩固，通航也是沒有問題的了。現在我們要硏究的　　通航以後　　的利益在那裏？通航以後，江西出產的米糧，磁器，廣東出產的水　，湖南出產的米，浙江上八府屬出產的木材，米，棉花，茶，布，藥材，都可以由浙贛路運到杭州，再由水路運到上海各地。本來有許多的貨物也是甲木船木筏由水運到杭州來，再用火車，或仍用木筏，木船，水運至上海等地的，現在，錢塘江的一航運通了，可以迅速的大量的。　　貨暢其流　　用不到再這楊的跋涉與麻煩了。同　的，很多上海等埠的出產品，也可運到內地來交流。　　根據統計卅六年八月份經滬杭鐵路運　的米爲一六二九七五四公斤，棉花爲一五五〇〇〇公斤，蔬菜爲九七六〇四〇公斤，烟葉爲九五二九三五公斤，茶爲五六七七九八公斤。藥材爲二〇〇二〇公斤，紙爲二一八五〇〇公斤，棉織品爲三六七四八〇公斤，絲織品爲五二四九〇公斤，棉紗爲五五〇〇九二公斤，烟捲爲大九七〇二〇公斤，糖爲五三五五七一公斤，魚鮮爲一七五七八三公斤，木料爲一二五八七一〇公斤。速其他一切物品在內，共運轍爲八七八二七二三公斤。我們再根據浙贛路上　至杭州的運輪號稱三千噸的數字，則兩相併合的數字已是相當浩大了，而况還有很多貨物未經鐵路運輸的。所以如果錢塘江通航了，她的經濟價値是特別大的。同時，因爲杭滬的通航，還可以杭溫通航，這樣，我們有許多貨物不必一定經上海轉口，她的價値更大了。目前通航的問題端在實行的人了。中聯公司願意投資來　　經營通航　　，亞洲實業公司　以三千噸的船兩艘來投資，如果經營得快的話，　七年的春天，我們可以了。記者特爲此事，曾訪晤中聯公司杭州負責任朱祖舜，示他吿知記者，現在調查貨運的價值和所必須投資的數目，據他看，如國錢江通航了，貨物可以放在碼頭的倉庫內，而可以把貨單來做押匯，這是一件便利商業而又極其經濟的事。依他約略佔計：開始投資要二百億元，他計劃中在西興設碼頭，因爲那裏可以把上江水運而來的貨物轉運到外面去。他預備通往溫州，假定滬杭航綫爲三百公程，則需要二十小時，兩條船每天打來回，即由滬駛杭，駛溫，再由溫駛杭駛滬，在杭交接。他說：「這是一件極有興趣的事。不過開治灣，必定要賠本的，以前自然會　錢，貨運的費用一定要比火車運費便宜。通航的事情，如果進行得快，二個月以後就可以實行了」。我們非常高興的期盼錢塘江能在最短的兩月以後通航，因爲這可以把　南的血脈流通，這可以把杭州的經濟地位特別提高！閘口建水站　七億工程費　明年六月底完竣　　〔本報杭州廿九日訊〕省水利局鑒於杭縣，海寗一帶，每値早天缺水，農田受害頗烈，決在明年二月開始在閘上建築水站，汲取錢塘江水，灌溉附近農田。該站將裝置二百二十五四馬力之抽水機，所需工程費爲七億四千萬元，預定明年六月底可完成。　　〔本報杭州卅日電〕杭市文化運動委員會，爲宣揚西北民族藝術，提高民衆　術興趣，時請儲委員裕生赴滬接洽，邀請新網歌舞團來杭遊覽西湖並表演邊疆藝術。聞此議頗有博得該團同意之可能。蘇高院檢查處昨開年終會議　　〔本報蘇州　日電〕警告院檢察處年終會議，今日下午由韓　首席主持舉行，決議：　加速散佚進行執行漢奸財產。　整訓司法警察。　檢察官加勸視察監所。　各科室公文處理力求迅速。各地匪犯購物等應併送法院審理　　司法行政部飭警局遵照〔本報蘇州卅日電〕司法行政部頃通電各地警察機關，飭對所獲盜匪案件之贓物及武器，應運同匪犯一併移送法院，以利審訊。如有藉故截留情事，將以侵占論罪。袖珍新聞　　蘇州　　〔本報訊〕蘇縣參議會以各校教師淸苦，執敎辛勸不　，至堪欣佩，時於　七日以一屆三次大會名義，通電致　，以資激勵。　　〔又訊〕三十六年度行將終了，本縣四十萬石賦額，迄今僅微起五萬餘石頭，與省令微起八成，相距尙遼，縣長王介佛廿九日農晉省報告微糧現狀，並請示辦法。　　江陰　　〔本報訊〕邑西前周鄕禮敬寺主持老僧　　淸，因有通匪關係，容留匪徒住宿，廿七日　刑警隊將老　及匪徒葉賽川等五名達捕，據稱係强征公糧，並在寺中獲得信件多封，廿八日解縣辦理。　　〔又訊〕縣參議會，討論地二日開一屆三次大會，討論地方各要事件。　　宜興　　〔本報訊〕宜賽珞川　至張　段錢面工程，早已全部修復，所有沿路橋　前全遭敵　摧毁，負責是項工程之技術人員，刻正漏夜　辦，預定明年一月底，預計可望究成，至通車日期，尙須由交通部公路局派員勘驗後，再行呈省核定。　　常熟　　〔本報訊〕本縣業已編成常備中隊入個中隊，分駐鄕鎭要隘，担任防務。據縣當局消息：王主席即將蒞　檢閱，並予剴切訓示　　海寗　　〔本報訊〕縣府廿八日第九次縣政會議，通過自卅七年元旦起，正式成立民衆自術隊總部。　　衢州　　〔本報訊〕　州。龍游。常山。開北。江山旅杭人士余紹宋，童蒙正等，以上述五地轄區遼闊，人口衆多，此次立委選舉，至少　在浙江第四立委選舉區中獲得立委名額一人，以示公允，特聯名電請中央核辦，並函請五縣參議會一致響應。吳興菱湖鎮一角　教育的綠洲　　〔本報吳興廿六日訊〕浙江的農敎事業，正在突飛猛晋之中，尤其在這敎育感到困乏的時候，總算發現了一塊小小的綠洲。在吳興的一個只有八千人的小小的菱湖鎭上，產生了一個値得稱頌的中心模範中小學校，他們在加緊進行着　　掃除文盲的工作。　　本省沈主席，對於敎育向極注重，今年四月中，沈主席巡視到菱湖，很讚美了菱鎭的農業建設，但同時他諄諄指出了敎育的不可忽略。菱湖本來有一個靑樹小學，不幸在抗戰期間解散了，勝利後，原創辦人章榮初先生毅然獨力負起了復興的經濟重任，特地聘請潘公展先生做董事長，積極進行復校，而達到現有的規模。菱湖是一個水鄕，　　土腴水秀，地方雖小，却也應盛。靑樹中小學在菱鎭的南部，環境優良，三面繞水，佔地有四十多畝。一進校門，就可以看到齊整的樹木，一式新建的校舍，整潔寬大。該校的大禮堂相當宏大堂皇，可以容納一千多人，聽說建造這些校屋，在今年二月裏，已費去了三十多億。到這裏來讀書的學生，　　完全免費，很多是從他鄕趕來的，作爲寄宿生。學生總動現有一千二百多人，而菱湖全鎭的學齡兒童，現共約愛三千人，這表示差不多百分之五十的兒童已都有了書讀。在菱湖的鄰鄉，還有着十三個分校，一共也有一千多學生。　　上月十三日，上海的敎育家胡懷天，潘伯棠等，來校參觀，他們驚異於這兒的設備之齊全，甚至比起上海最好的小學，亦無遜色。除了在體育方面，他們有籃球，排球塲和田徑塲之外，還有自然，美術，音樂，勞作，四個特種敎室。誰也不會相信，在這普樂室中，會有一座最好的新式大型鋼琴。校中的圖書館，現有　　藏書數萬册，且有萬有文庫，四庫全書，備爲敎師們進修之用。另外，兒童們自然動植物的實騐室，也極富興趣。該校的醫務室相當完備，專替學生敎員檢査身體，治療疾病，並按時舉行防疫注射。　　靑樹現有敎師四十五人，多數都是大學或師範科畢業的。他們在敎學外，又着重培養兒童的實際能力，高尙的風格，領導學生辦理自治會，並經常舉行演說，書法，淸潔等比賽，因爲這是一個鄉村的學校，而該校的學生多是農家子弟，風氣非常淳樸。　　靑樹的創辦人與該校同人，對於現有的規模仍不滿足，他們正在進行一極龐大的　　發展計劃，他們準備另建中學校舍，並且籌辦職業　校，創造蠶桑，絲織，會計等低級技術人員，如此，小學生便可增收到二千五六百人，這樣，差不多全鎭的兒童全都可有書讀了。我們竭誠希望這學校再接再屬地進展，爲的是一個鄕鎭學校的建設，雖僅造福一地，但我們希望這興學之風，普遍地廣播開去，使得受福的不僅是這一鎭，而是全省乃至全國。（北星）蘇高檢處通緝在逃漢奸一批　包括偽縣長多名　　〔本報蘇州卅日電〕蘇高檢處今績起訴通緝在逃漢奸一批，計有僞吳縣長於宗豫，僞南匯縣長劉禹平，邵振華，僞無錫地院長郭懷璞，僞無錫地檢署長趙輔庭等多名。渝市地院推事　楊文達停職扣押　　〔中央社重慶卅日電〕渝市地院推事楊文遠，近被控利用職權舞弊達二十餘億元之大貪汚案，川高院調卷査閱後，已交渝地院偵査，並將被控推事楊文遠停職扣押。據告發人黃友文稱：「江北德成被服廠以無法返還軍政部軍需署被服廠定金布疋，負責人逃匿，經地院査封其不動產及棉被掃地花一批拍賣償還，計棉被三萬一千七百四十五床，掃地花七千五百斤。本年七月四日地院張貼公吿，拍賣棉被數目僅爲三千七百四十五床，棉花七百七十斤，其中顯有幣賽。」蘇省臨參會　請修建江南海塘　　〔本報鎭江廿九日訊〕江南海塘工程，蜿蜒三百餘公里，戰前會按年由中央撥款與修，自戰使發生後，迄今未加培修，致有若干地段已險象畢露，曾經蘇省建設廳派員勘估，修理工費需四百六十億元，始能完成全部工程，江蘇省臨參會以此項工程有關江南十餘縣人民生命財產，特函請省府向中央請撥專款，從事修建上饒記者公會成立　　〔本報上饒廿六日訊〕者公會，於二十五日舉行成立會，出席會員四十餘人，推定蔣元黨·余言·汪嘯　三人爲常務理事。</p>

<p>花紗布管委會招待新聞界　闡述全面管制目標　希望一年內將停開紗錠恢復運轉　　〔本報訊〕全國花紗布管理　良良，昨日在該會首次公開招待新聞新界，發表該會改組設立緣起，及未來拖負甚詳，茲摘誌大要如如次：　　渠稱：政府過去對棉紗，有種種管制政策，結果俱遷失敗，致演變爲今日花紗布全面管制之局，實行統購統銷代紡代織政策。此　鑒於過去之管致政策，管紗而不及花與布，而在花貴於紗，紗貴於布之局面下，如不控制棉花，紗布價格亦將無從穩定。相信全面管制後，必能使花紗布之價格，趨於穩定，決不致脫離本位，而隨金鈔或其他物資盲漲。　　袁氏解釋：値茲全國動員　亂時期，重心當在軍事，惟尤須經濟情況配合。而穩定經濟，首在掌握物資，調節供需。花紗在之管制，主旨在抑制少數人之暴利，而謀大多人經濟生活之安定。惟全面管制政策施行伊始，各方容有未明利害得失，心存猜忌，此點端賴輿論界，多多宣揚解釋。　　統購棉花策實施後，因新機構人手不齊，又爲顧及棉商生計，仍將委託有經騐之棉商，及各紗廠原各地之收花機構代購。惟目前地方不靖，急需　購。故暫時決先委託紡建公司全部代購，資金另由中央銀行調撥。本年產棉，估計雖達一千萬担。惟可供收購者，不過三百萬祖，將酌量騐入印美棉補充。同時希望在一年內，將全國現時停開之紗錠一百萬枚，估計因此而增產之棉紗，年了達六十萬件，俾便加强外銷。　　袁氏最後指出此次管理辦法之精神所在，認爲政府今後決通過管制政策，督促棉紡事業，改進設施，努力於前途之發展。渠認爲管理政策是善良的，袛需執行政策之人員，嚴正盡責，必能貫澈管理政策之目的。　　袁氏旋答記者問，茲　誌如此：　今後紗布，仍有市場，惟價格由紗管會訂定。故價格採定價制，而非議價制。同時仍准各紗商運銷全國各地。相信在全面管制下，儘量調劑格供需，決無黑市。　如全國紗錠四百五十萬枚，全部開足，棉紗可造成供渦於求之局。以紗錠二枚產量，配合織幾一台需要計算，全國產紗供應，更屬綽有餘裕。　將來除配售棉紗外，仍將發出一部份棉紗，採取報價核配方式，俾棉紗能普遍供應各方需要。　在全面管制下，無論　製業，紗商，棉商，布商等，仍有業務經營。紗管會在各方面，仍將委託代辦，利潤且得　當保障云。中信購買行總米麥　總計一萬四千餘公噸合同已於廿六日簽訂　　〔本報訊〕行總與中央信託局在本月二十六日簽定合同，由該局向行總購買聯總運華之米一萬二千七百四十九公噸及小麥二千另八十九公噸，以助我政府配給糧食之用，其中有百分之五之差額可按實際數量而增减。該合同簽定時特由聯總代表桑伯證明，內容共分五條。　　關於付款問題，其第五條甲項規定：在合同簽定後，中央信託局即應付給行總（如行總結束後則交與善後事業委員會保管委員會）卅六年美金公債美元一，六六九，二七五即總額中之百分之九十。此價格係按照每噸（不分米麥）美金一百二十五元計算。　　乙，其餘款項應在全部檢量報吿完畢後依照確實數量付給，但此項報告卞得遲至一九四八年一月一日起四十五日後完成。如中信局在二月底以前猶禾編彙確實數量，則即應根據淸單上所載明之數量付款。　　至其倉庫棧租，在十二月三十一日以前者則由行總負責，一月一日起即應由中信局負責，同時以後之倉庫保險，搬運費用，秤量費用，以及任何損失發生均應由中信局自理。　　米市疲軟產價略降〔本報訊〕米市昨値年終結賬之期，各幫進出均以現鈔爲限，頭寸短缺者無力收購，加以內地產價略降，故市呈疲軟，勢趨穩定。南北二市登記到貨共一萬五千二百二十九石，南市除高檔仍勉維原價外，中次貨各挫萬元。北市情形大致相同，但特高粳仍堅二萬元。　　據社會局糧食科長吉明爾談稱：米市今明二日休息。照一般情形預測，管認爲昨日米價有狂漲趨勢。但結果甚爲平穩，此皆由於嚴格執行現金交易所收之成效。明年度抑平米價之第一步措施，仍將執行此一政策。　　雜糧堅定油價飛漲　　麵粉續向高峯疾進，麩皮存底不多，豆餅再挺七八千元。黃豆供求兩稀，客豆平正，杜黃略見挺秀，　豆到銷兩淡，價無軒　，赤豆零化香燥，猛跳三四萬元，蠶豆回高萬元。紅糧成交不多，形勢漲定，苞米北洋納胃轉懈，趨勢平平，生仁廣帮進胃蟬聯，本街相繼添辦，逐步高翔，盤漲三五萬元，芝蔴消化活潑，挺升一二萬元，黑蔴彷彿。　　油市因封關數天，店方納胃蜂起，互相爭取，瘋狂上漲。豆油狂奔十餘萬元，淸油猛加七八萬元，菜油暴漲十餘萬元，蔴油生汕飛騰二十餘萬元，小麥再加一二萬元。紡建代購棉花仍歸紗管統配　　〔本報訊〕據紡建公司副總經理吳味經氏語記者：該公司業已奉到紗管會委託　購國棉之公事，惟以紗管會迄未正式成立，且估計明年一月份所需之取購資金二萬億元，中央銀行亦迄未撥到，故正式協定，尙未談妥。紗管會爲利便計，委託紡建駐各地收花機構及人員代辦購棉，紡建固當照辦，惟各界或有未明眞相，認爲該公司代購原棉後，良花將被該公司優先採用。蠶則不然，在統購政策下紡建將來如接受代辦，所收之棉花，仍將　交紗管會，再由該會按各廠紗錠設備，統籌分配，紡建決無價先全力云美金庫卷募銷統計　　〔本報訊〕據悉：卅六年美金短期庫劵，十二月份將售至除夕（今日）止，卅七年一月份　額，仍將以本年底後餘數額織　發售，一月四日前因元旦及行莊決算暨星期例假暫行停售，至一月五日起再行發售，又自第二期發行以來，截至十二月廿九日止，全國各地共售出二，七六五，三〇〇美元，內上海國家行局經售一，七九九，二六〇美元，並悉：卅六年美金公債第二期　票，業由財政部撥交國行，並經分撥各經售行局，認購人自即日起，可持同預約券前往原經收價款行局換領正式億票云。桐油喊價上揚　　桐油市情，交易雖以年關而淸稀，但因外匯掛高，更爲渝市現貨電報升起九萬，行商喊價心思甚俏，足度油每担爲二百卅五萬元，掛高十萬，西洪油二百五十萬，本熬洪一百九十五萬元。外滙提高　　〔本報訊〕外匯平衡基金委員會爲適應需要，鼓勵出口，吸收外匯壽嗎，昨又提高外匯市價。美匯掛高六千元，基價八萬九千元。英匯掛高兩萬元，基價二十九萬元。指定銀行美匯　進八萬八千元，責出九萬元；英鎊進價二十八萬七前元，售出二十九萬三千元。盧比港幣均亦分別調整，　比牌價二萬一千七百十二元二角四分，提高一千四百九十七元四角。港幣一萬入千零四十九元四角八分，掛高一千一百卅四元七角九分。外傳陽曆年關後將取消外匯市價說，據悉：完全不確，有關方面並無所聞。銀行錢莊　新年休假三天　　中央銀行昨日公吿，元且起休假三日，各行莊亦循例休假三天，四日爲星期日，五日始開始營業。證交第一日停市　華股場外買氣旺　小型普遍喊高而三元　　華股昨證交雖吿停市，但塲外之讓受，仍有若千做開。外匯牌價之提高，引起買氣，趨勢向榮，中途雖一度因銀根未見寬鬆而有回，但最後仍見堅定，不過交易泰半屬於喊價性質而已。當日交割之永紗五四三元及五四五元成交，隔日交割開出昂至五五五元及五六〇元，中途五五五元有賣少買，最後仍屬買價。開關交割初開五八〇元，中途退至五七五元，但最後竟有喊高至五八五元。各小型股普遍喊高二三元，俱屬隔日交割，內計新光八十一二元，景福七十二三元，勤興五二元，華豐二七二元，華新一七二元，信和三一五元，美亞九三〇元，交易不甚普遍。各未上市股票亦見堅俏，中國銀行介乎九五萬與九八萬之間，有剩餘頭寸者，賡續搜羅。　　公債見秀外股趨漲　　公債昨借款消息利多，中途見秀，臨收仍盤。統丙晨開二九二〇〇元，自二九〇〇〇元升至三〇六〇〇元，而後再退至二九七〇〇元左右徘徊。成交約四百萬，較前收計甲乙丙漲六百元，丁戊升四百元。　　外股昨獲證券帮中大戶分兵來裂，有求少供，籌碼有限，形勢穩健，怡紗介乎四三萬左右，英聯六七萬，均屬求者見殷，前途向榮成份見多。結果較冷各股未曾做開，業廣尙平，餘股普遍趨漲少許。細紗收盤見昂棉布行情疲軟　　昨日棉紗市況，以年關兼月底關係，銀根又形緊　，初開即有多頭續吐，行情喊低，四十二支藍鳳細紗，小至四千八百五十萬元尙有供售，二十一支雙馬三萬一百萬　賣。嗣因客帮見低進吸，近收本街織廠略有小額收進，及實力派頭寸軋平，乘價廉吃進，市勢得以干　　上。最後四十而支藍鳳細紗，升高至四千九百五十萬元，比上日回漲四十萬。寳光水月金城等均升七八十萬元，三十二支藍鳳等續挫二三萬至六七萬元，此外二十支十六支十支等粗紗，互有一二十萬元之升沉。　　昨日棉布市况，長開散戶吐售仍多行情疲軟，嗣後復有民營廠商供售色布白布，額量龐大，並以十日至半月期支票提取現貨，時山西帮抛售亦夥，價乃狂寫。寸二磅龍頭細在低至一百三十四萬元，尙乏受主。迨至午收，因美匯提高，市氣稍形回堅，結果龍頭細布此上日步小五千元，五福彩球燈各檔回漲自五千至二三萬元。此外　雙直貢及粗布價亦回秀，其餘各布市仍平疲。　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售五〇八〇　，申購單九七張，內廠商四張，解布六六〇張，布號九三張，購土布四四二〇張。　棉商小組會議決作最後努力　　〔本報訊〕本市棉花商業公會昨下午三時舉行十七人小組會議，共商歷次向各方接洽請願經過，意見二點：　紗管會及紡建公司對統購原棉事，尙無確切表示，棉商生計實已斷絕，且漢口同業來電，亦有同感，故已成爲全國性棉商數十萬人之生存問題。　紗管會暫時全部委託紡建代購棉花，棉商認爲紡建散處各地之收花機構，不及棉商之普遍，歷史亦不及棉商，故認爲紡建對搶購恐乏實力。最後決議定明年一月七日，擴大招待各界，作緊急呼　云。人絲初疲後堅　　人造絲昨市初疲後堅，一二〇號旭字一　有光，上午開盤在七千八百五十萬元左右，旋聞外匯牌價掛高，人心呈堅，中午收盤升至九百五十萬元，下午最後成交價爲九百萬元，賣出價九百五十萬元，比上日軋漲五十萬元。　　捲烟略升昨日捲烟市勢，初開仍佳，中途因銀根軋緊有吐　降，午後以年假封關在即，同業中頭寸　　者，納胃甚健，各方收吸亦活。結果十支大英比上日績漲六十萬，老刀則微降五萬，此外金等華商　，亦步升自五百至一二千元。美貨條　及五十支聽　穩疲憊互見外銷茶堅定　　茶市洋莊交易，除午昌茶葉公司對於本年度兩湖紅茶尙有一千餘箱吸進，價爲每担一百五十萬元，餘則依然未見做開，而情勢均猶堅定。至於內銷花色，徽烘，紹炒及低檔紅茶，津浦各路續有染指，人心活躍如故，做開價格仍俏。</p>

<p>文學一個永久的歉疚　對震華法師的懺悔  施蟄存　　民國二十六年二月間，我買到了一部明初歷仙刻本白玉蟾集。讀了其中贈豫章尼黃心大師的一詩一詞，不禁遐想。頗欲知道這黃心大師的詳細事蹟，可是找了一些書，也竟找不出來。但從即詩詞的辭氣來看，從那詞題下注的「嘗為官妓」這句話看來，也克約略揣測其人了。既無載籍可求，何妨借她來作現成的題材，演寫為我的小說。因此在三月十日那天，就動手用近乎宋人詞話的文體寫了一篇「黃心大師」。整整的寫了兩天，在十一日晚間才寫成了。當時恰巧朱孟實先生在創辦「文學雜誌」，馳書徵稿，不遺鄙陋，即將此文寄去，遂得在是年六月一日出版的「文學雜誌」第二期上發表了出來。關於這寫小說的文體，在我是一種嘗試，實在也克說是一種摹傲，承朱先生的　愛，在編輯后記中對我這種半文言半白話的文體給予了誇飾的獎借。如果說這篇小說會經受過一些讀者的注意，恐怕多半還是由於朱先生的吹噓。　　至於這篇小說里的故事，百分之百是虛構的。我在篇中曾經提起過載一個藏書家那裡看到了無名氏著的「比丘尼傳」十二卷的明初抄本殘帙，以及明人小說「洪都雅致」二冊，並且也曾引用了此二書中幾段關於黃心尼記載，其實全出於偽造，正如莪相之詩與梅晴的古文尚書一樣。一切都僅僅是爲了寫小說，從來沒有人在小說裏尋求信史的！　　可是，出於我意外，當時竟有一位讀者被我無意中欺哄了。而這位讀者又正是虔誠地在編纂比丘尼的傳記，有志於繼承懋皎賓唱諸法師的偉業。於是我的荒誕無根的故事，卻被採用為實錄了。　　這是一直到去年才知道的事，去年，民國三十五年，離我那篇小說的發表已經十年了，人民已經非但忘記了那篇小說，而且已經遍歷了佛家所謂三中劫。我流浪回來，因給上海出版公司編「活時代」半月刊，所以常常到廈門路尊德裡上海出版公司去。但那祗有三個月的時間，因為「活時代」出了幾期即告廢刊，我也到徐州去了。在徐州的時候，收到家裏給轉來的一封信，是一位素昧平生的震華和尚寫給我的。其全文云：「蟄存先生惠鑒：文名仰慕已久，恨無憂識荊，以敘所懷。近聞報章，知任「活時代」編輯，居於廈門路尊德裡，相隔咫尺，喜何可言。茲有一事奉請，特命二侍者來前商談，乞勿　其唐突是幸。余有志於佛教史學之研究，迄今已遂念年之久，曾編有佛教人名大辭典史書數種，以事變後印刷奇昂，致未付印。憶丁丑夏初，閱讀學生雜誌（按此是和尚誤記），見有「黃心大師」一文，知先生亦有志於史學之研究。該文中之引言謂「北平某藏書家　有明鈔本比丘尼傳八卷」，當時見閱之下，恨不能乞為介紹借閱。余所編之「續比丘尼傳」數卷，常抱憾未得將該書廣作參　，迄今時隔九載，猶每為憶及。中國歷史中以中國佛教史為最難研究，比丘尼史更難着手。該藏書家所有明鈔本藏之至今，完好無缺（按此亦和尚誤記，我在小說中已說是殘帙了）。不慧深恐占德幽光，永其沉埋。擬請先生代為轉請該藏書家代為鈔錄惠寄。筆資多寡，當為負責匯奉。如該藏書家以為麻煩，請示知，余當請在平之友好代為傳鈔。事關發揚古德懿光，當能慨允勿却。近為二　所困，命弟子代書所懷，　命其前來探訪商談，請賜予接談為幸。抽編「續比丘尼傳」請予指教，餘不　，此頌編安，不懋震華拜啟五月十八日」　　我看了這封信，當下就感到很惶恐，一個在病中的老和尚，還在念念不忘於我虛構出來的明鈔本比丘尼傳，要覓得這部書來充實他的著作。這不是我已經欺哄了一個正直的人嗎？幸而我沒有再尊德里，避免了直接與他的二位高徒見面，否則我是不是應該告訴他們，這一切都是我意像的故事呢？他們送我的「續比丘尼傳」沒有一併寄到徐州，所以當時沒有見道。我以為他也許沒有把黃心尼編錄進去，因為他孩子等待那明鈔本。我又慶幸他的「佛教人名大辭典」沒有付印看，讓他可以有機會把黃心尼的名字刪去，如果他已經編進去的話。　　我不想使這位老和尚感到失望，所以我沒有覆那封信，一直到秋間。回到上海之後，我才看到他的大著，「續比丘尼傳」六卷三冊，佛經流通處的刻本，鎮江竹林寺藏板。在第二卷中，赫然有一篇南昌妙住庵尼黃心傳，完全是依據了我的小說寫成的！在卷尾的他的弟子超塵的跋語中，又記述了他對於那明鈔本比丘尼傳的惦念，以為「如能設法借得，余書將改製矣。」一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風　　序幕尾聲　　（敬告讀者——筆者自握管試筆以來，始終以遊擊姿態出現；偶有塗抹，發表刊物，亦僅以旅行雜誌，申報二者為限；初無業派與背景可言，亦始終不敢以「文人」或「作者」目，受命纂述本稿，雖仍一貫遊擊姿態，則未當不竊竊自慶；蓋個人本有一肚子心酸，而八年抗戰之英勇兒女，或死，或殘，或流落，或埋沒，亦莫不各有一肚子辛酸；今獲茲良機，撰述之成文，公諸讀衆，噩夢重溫——一寸山河，皆是一寸鮮血換來……不其可慶？着手屬稿以來，雖未致廢寢忘餐，然已竭盡心力。特才具有限，技術淺薄，終負此大好題材耳。且今，過分努力，致　氣停閉，滯留於任督二脈之間，內臟因而震傷，（仿佛習靜者之走火入魔。）廿餘載辛勤，毀於一旦。後獲內家指示，試行「意想術」（正宗中之旁門）；二個月後，始覺下丹田呼吸，有恢復傾向。不意九月中旬，忽又罹患貧血惡症，脈搏降至五十七跳，雖臥床不動，亦覺天旋地轉，此十餘年來，缺乏營養及　沛流連之結果也。雖然，月餘後仍勉強繼續工作，蓋欲完成「七封秘緘」全稿也。然每一握管，即感頭暈目眩，橫　膜脹痛；同時校課又煩重異常，不能請假，乃函　春秋主編進珊兄，暫停刊載，俾得稍事養息，進珊兄以本稿已近尾聲，宜對讀者，有始有終，不允所請，乃試行口授筆錄；儘數千字，覺不如意，仍勉強走筆，寫完第九章及第十章（末章）數節，而稿可以同時結束，不了而了矣，詎意餘稿仍在文學週刊出現，而主編者堅稱必須有一濃縮或之尾聲，作全卷閉幕式。不獲已，乃勉成此篇。有負編者與讀者之處，謹此掬晠致歉。——筆者）　　「七封秘緘」全卷，係全搞九卷——「二號前哨」，「神秘口令」，「夜漫漫」，「夜春」，「夜如何其」，「風雨如晦」，「芷江冷月」等卷的序幕。「七封秘緘」雖已發表了三四十萬字，惟筆者行文瑣碎拖沓，僅僅還只介紹了百多名脚色中的十來名；描寫技能的淺薄低能，於此可見。　　「秘缄」的高潮，在揭發軸心國發動大戰以前的密約。鶴見自從第一次搜索「秘緘」失敗之後，又　劃第二次的攻勢；恰巧近衛得到情報，招鶴見灰東京「受訓」，鶴見趁這機會，企圖孤注一擲。　　但是　次走在鶴見前頭一步的超然派「浩然老人」（現年七十五歲）青木長老（在政治上屬西圓寺派）不等鶴見貿然涉險，便派萍子把他硬接了去，並且強他歸宗，（因鶴見劍道，實係浩然一宗）把不傳之秘的「浩然劍訣」也贈了給他。之後，老人和鶴見舉行了半小時的秘密談話（此舉是否重要，以後各卷都有關連。他如近衛下台及中毒，——有人謂係自殺，那是笑話——內閣　次更調，東條被迫下台，本莊紫受窘，海軍大將某墮海等等，都有直接關係。）　　「受訓」一幕，鶴見當初以為是軍事裁判一類舉動，後由「〇十二」說明，（係萍子由老人處得來），方知又是一個震古鑠今的牢籠魔術。同時時受訓的有二百餘人之多，都是日本最優秀的神秘特工份子，惟因採用　面隔離方式，大家無法交談。幸虧萍子和圓子在場上用特殊手法，向鶴見傳達消息，鶴見才把同場的秘密客，在三日夜中，探悉了一大半。以後鶴見始終能履險若夷，都靠這一點力量。　　受訓終了，青木長老指揮浩然宗的劍客和鶴見的部下，暗地闖入「天皇」御檔案室，搜索第五號宗卷——及「七封秘緘」—與御禁衛及潛伏劍士激鬥，春子（錢與鶴見鬥劍者）因掩護萍子而受傷，搜索所得僅關於政治，食糧，兩節。其餘軍事，經濟，武器，情報，等約文，並無踪跡，當由圓子用非常手段，探悉第五縱隊首長沙登，已將該件之軍事部分全文節略，携往大連，正與大陸參謀總部重要份子，商討實施步驟。　　等到鶴見，萍子，安坂，淺野，箭川，上野，和田等，趕到大連，沙登早已飛過瀋陽，往天津去了。　　鶴見一行到達天津的時候，Ｗ君已在該地「法租界」主理地下工作，指揮群眾及學界抗敵。幾個團體和我反諜份子，犧牲之慘，眞無法描寫。（Ｗ君現已加入密宗，並略略參加政治活動。）女的押入招待所，剝去衣履，獸淫至死，男的除水，火，電，各式非刑外，還有報導從未一見的種毒菌—如結核菌，腦炎菌等，—割神經，使成盲啞或白癡，瘋狂，打冲刺靶，割肉食不厌精餧狗，灌鹽湯等等。　　最後一幕，鶴見佈置了搜索沙登的窩所，駐津京的第五縱隊，聯合日偽特動隊，強力抵禦。雙方之戰，先由暗中摸索，而成為正式衛殺。鶴見亟敗，忽異軍突起，自敵巢倒戈殺出，鶴見方能得手。異軍共十餘人，由三人為首，皆戴奇型面具，一最勇猛者中彈倒地，幸被敵巢上賓買沙夫救出。　　鶴見劫出了「秘緘」之後，心下無限歡暢，以為向國際揭破之後，正義方面，聯合干涉，軸心或將停止其陰謀，暫緩作戰了。殊不知打開秘緘一看，乃是德文副稿，並非全文，僅僅一個綱要而已。鶴見的一衆中，只有上野一人認得幾個德國字，Ｗ君雖說發電上北平，召取一位懂德文的來，又得耽擱一天，甚至數天工夫。大家正無辦法，忽然跳進一個假面具的人，舉動潑辣梯突，鬧過一陣玩笑，這才揭開面具，原來又是那位「人妖」買沙夫。她替鶴見把秘緘譯出之後，並報告了一個惡消息：　　「您那最欽佩的小老虎，已經中彈受傷，槍彈擊中肺葉，幸虧他的體質特殊，所以熱度不高，現正在一個秘密所在受手術。他是三個戴面具之一。其他兩人，一位是耀　小姐，一位是死裏逃生的吳鼎元先生。…您想去看他們嗎？……對不起，他們都不願見您！……只等小老虎起床，我們就得動身上張北去了！」　　鶴見把「秘緘」內容，備成幾封正式文件，用某種正大名義，鄭重寄了給英，美，法，幾個元首和大臣。犧牲了好多生命，花費了無限心血換來的秘密文件，結果您知道怎樣？——出乎意料以外，這片熱血和生命，只換到了一個大「？」和幾聲哈哈！因為他們不相信小小的日本，敢在太歲頭上動土。（完）　　　附啓者…本稿單行本出版問題，目下仍是問題；因目前排工奇昂，紙價飛騰，竟無法獲到一種合理性的出版方式。雖然，筆者當不斷努力進行，覓取發行者合作。一俟體力復原，且擬將全部九卷寫出，　此警告。—筆者　　　文壇通訊　最近台灣的文化　　台灣喊了兩年的「溝通祖國文化」，到現在還是呈現着荒漠，淒涼，土着的台灣文化，染有濃重的日本色彩，從大陸來的祖國文化却又未能盡滿人意。立意純正作為真正的祖國文化而進入海島者不是沒有。而大都則抱滿腔希望而來，帶着失望而去。就音樂而論，省交響樂團以古典音樂出現，現在則因省庫支細即將解消；就劇團來論，歐陽予倩領導的新中國劇團鍛羽而歸。目前的觀眾公司，又　奄奄一息，騎虎難下。就出版界論，純文藝或高級的雜誌就少有人問津，沒一家不虧本，文化界的現象是可悲的。這裡有幾個文化工作者，但起不了作用，祗是靜悄悄的，偶爾來幾個文化人，巴金，張光宇，及現在台灣的田漢等，都是觀光性質，或搜集資料的。相反地，惡劣低級的，連環圖畫之類，却跟着單幫客的夥子拖進了海島，廣泛地攫住了各階層的讀者。大家很含片這種畸形的文化交流，勢將影響正常的文化發展。廿三日成立的藝術建設協會，網羅了再台的藝術文化工作者一七六人，總希望能有一點成就。台灣實在太需要內地文化的交流，但祗限於眞正的，不是賣膏藥的，且須得當局的全力支持。（幕銀十二月二十三日）封筆大吉  進珊　　唱戲的一到年殘歲底，照例要反串一場封箱戲，然後封上衣箱，回家過年。小時候還記得衙門裏的老規矩，每　除夕，循例要在宮印印匣上加一張黃紙封條，上書「封印大吉」字樣，然後讓師爺班房以至衙役們回家過年，大概就是放假的意思。因為一年辛苦下來，有此休假，大家可以輕鬆幾天，過個新年，原意倒也未可厚非。　　因此想到我們文人，值此除夕之夜，一無衣箱行頭，二無衙門官印，三則也無人給假休息；自己只有一張會吃飯能講話的嘴，和一支塗塗抹抹的筆：嘴呢，處在這種時代米貴話難講，話可不講，飯却不能不吃；爲了吃飯更不宜多講話，最好是不講話；本已不封自封，也可說是封無可封。現在輪到文人的唯一的武器的那支筆了——　　說起這支筆呦，也會有過光榮的身世。自從「天子重英豪，文章教爾曹」以來，便是「我有筆如刀」了。所以也曾有人頌贊過「筆陣獨掃千人軍」，說它有如張翼德的丈八蛇矛，攻堅挫銳，勢不可當；可以記筆建塚，都已傳為土林佳話。的確，它會寫下人類五千年的文明史蹟，也曾描出男女老少的悲歡離合；僅這

<p>自由談野有餓莩  文介　　據鄉間來人說—　　鄉間經八年外戰二年內亂，窮苦人家的姑娘，只要你給她一頓飽飯喫，她便會跟了你跑，做你的妻子；她竟會不問你姓甚名誰，或幹何營生，有許多女子便是這樣的跟隨土匪或軍隊去了。她們走後，做父母的心里自然也想念，可是不會設法去找她們回來，理由不言自明。　　鄉間市集上，除平常的蔬菜鷄鴨外，常有出賣小孩的。只須出很小的代價，便可檢得一個孩子。有的竟並沒有父母陪伴着，只是被遺棄在那里，任其自覓生路。其中似也有兄妹遭遺棄的，他會看到一對兄妹，爲兄的至多也不過三四歲，旁邊躺着他的妹子，尙是一個嬰兒，本來應躱在母親懷中的，而今躺在地上，她的像是皺皮乾癟橘子的頭枕在男孩的膝上，一副相依爲命的樣子。這個男孩如今不只是嬰兒的哥哥，而且是她的父親，她的母親，她世間唯一的朋友了。想來這對兄妹的命終是活不了的吧。　　又據鄉間來人說：有一天，鄉野中的一所破廟里發現一個小孩子，獨自在大聲哭泣着，他的腿被縛在神廟前石桌的脚上。待問明原由，才知他的母親呌他等在廟里，而他見娘獨自離他而去，他要追踪上去，好的娘便把他吊在石桌旁。鄉人見他可憐，設法找到了他的娘，把孩子交給了她。可是娘有什麼辦法呢！過了不久，大約是所謂「羞惡之心人皆有之」，不願爲他人看見吧，她把她的孩子帶到鄰村附近山谷中僻靜處去。給他一個　籃，一隻碗，一副筷子，便即轉身急急離去。孩子那里捨得離開他娘，瘋狂地追了上去，可是這樣小的孩子那里追得上；他是沿着一條河浜奔着，大約是着了慌，旣驚且急，一個不愼，便掉到河浜中，溺死了。那個母親當時曾否轉頭回顧一下，未據鄉間來人說明，後事怎樣，亦不詳細。　　聽了鄉人這一夕話，記起報上也有過類似的一段記載：「有一小孩哭於道，呼娘力竭聲嘶。有丁君遇而問之，小孩言我娘去買糖，云即來領我，今半日不來，吾娘不知往何處。問其住處，不能言。丁君見其衣襟上有綫，抽而視之，有字云：「此兒若有仁人君子憐憫收養，感激不盡」云。　　我猜這一代的人們大概比往昔任何一代的人要衰老得早，要衰老得快。靑年男女轉瞬間變得了老，戰後生養的孩子們也許會永遠不曾年靑過—從出生到死亡，其中沒有一個靑春時期。市區中常有倒斃屍體，無人收拾，而孩童們在屍體旁邊玩耍自如，不以爲　。這正象徵着這一代的孩子是在與「死亡」爲伍了。　　今日電車上見一老婦，着老式團花短襖，額圍老式「包頭」，二手滿抱南北貨紙包，癟嘴，嘴角滿掛笑容，一副等候歡樂過年的神情，表現着無限幸福，一如見子女生計日漸寬裕心里頗感愉快然。這幅「幸福圖」與鄉間來人所說對比一下，眞令人起「天上人間」之感。參觀宿舍  羅塔　　在男女社交公開的今日，學校裏每逢佳節，男女生宿舍開放，藉以互相觀摩，也可以算是一個很重要的「節目」。聖誕節那天，我在郊外的一個敎會學校裏，玩一整日，照例了參觀了一次男生宿舍。認得我的人一定會問：「發瘋了嗎？你是男人，參觀什麼三百六十五日出入無阻的男生宿舍，而不去看看三百六十四日『男賓止步』的女生宿舍？」　　情形是這樣的：因爲那早打電話呌我坐卡車去的是我的表姊，我在女主人們的房子裏坐了一個上午，連中飯也在她們的飯廳裏吃的，飯後，躺在她們的籐椅上午睡半小時，這當然不像是「參觀」了。下午，和她們一道去參觀男生宿舍，我說「參觀男生宿舍」，與去年司徒雷登大使在我校演講中的：「當我到美國留學的時候」一語，實有異曲同工之妙，初聽起來覺得有點荒唐，仔細一想幽默之感油然而生。　　我們從「根據地」出發，浩浩蕩蕩的開入男生宿舍，上了二樓，領隊的一位「現代女性」在一間房子的門前「咯，咯，咯！」敲門三響，待裏面應聲：「Come　in！」後推門而入，四位男士剛從床上跳起，拉一位衣襟，聳一聳領結，說聲：「大家隨便坐坐。」有幾位女生眞的就坐在他們的床沿上。桌上放着瓜子，桔子，糖，棗，各一碟頗有「正月初一」氣象。這時最受窘的莫過我一人了，男主人們個個向我掃了一眼，顯出非常不屑的樣子。只差沒有說出「儂來做啥？」遞過糖來，大家都有，惟我獨無，狼狽之狀，不下於伊索寓言中的蝙蝠。　　一連參觀了好幾間房子，都收恰得整潔非凡，一塵不染，連女生宿舍也望塵莫及。有一房地板上臘，如入舞池，床旁繋一頭哈吧狗，見了客人會搖頭擺尾，以示歡迎。主人又特地領我們到後面堆雜物的小房裏，欣賞他們的傑作，地上有廿餘雙靴子，皮鞋，布鞋，球鞋，拖鞋，依其長短大小，沿著牆根排前後兩列，一如「閱兵式」，彷彿只要一聲下令，就可以向左轉向右轉或開步走，女同學們見了，無不嘖嘖稱善。　　當然，明眼的人是不會上當的，男生宿舍—管它是國立，敎會，私立—平日是啥樣子，我也可以照樣排給你看。說到皮鞋，我突然記起一個可笑的故事來：　　一天，我約一位同學看電影，在圖書館裏等了好久不見他來，我着急了，跑上宿舍找他，看見這位男士大衣，帽子，手套全都穿戴好了，但一脚穿著皮鞋，一脚趿着拖鞋，沒頭沒腦的在房裏兜圈子。原來萬事俱備，祗欠帮他找了大半天，才在滿是灰塵的上發現，用胡琴把它一邊撥一邊掃了出來！我們的否決權  則仕　　新年將到，有三位朋友來和我談怎樣過新年的計劃。我對於新年素無好感，因爲年終結賑，所盈餘的只是年齡。我雖並不怎樣念念於去日苦多，又非女人，並無遲暮之感，但對於年齡之增多，究竟並不像金鈔之增多那麼樣痛快舒服。不過來客旣然要談怎樣過新年的計劃，我怎好掃他們之興，嚴詞拒絕。於是說：談談看罷。　　蘇康公先開口：「一切計劃必須一致同意！」說完後對三人中之一人的楳女士看了一看。楳女士素喜挾其女士之頭銜以令男士，凡男士之對她不言聽計從者，輒責之爲不尊重女權。康公却素以不尊重女權爲已任，於是與楳女士每見必抬杠，現在的發此一言，意即在先發制人。　　「你就不懂得Lady　first，我還沒有開口你就胡說！」楳女士返擊。　　「我是覺得誰先開口都無不可的，但Lady　first亦甚佳。」三人中之另一人殷兄發言。　　「好啦好啦，元旦去吃北京餃子，永安公司後面的那一家，價廉物美——」楳女士提案。　　「兄弟一定奉陪。」康公以應邀語氯接口。　　「大家拿出錢來聚餐！」楳女士趕緊說，「每人二十萬，誰都不許白吃誰！」　　「廿萬無所謂，但何妨吃川菜？」殷兄建議，他是四川人。　　「川菜不如粵菜。」廣東人的康公主張。　　「最好還是家裏燒點家常菜。」我懶於出門，就倡此議。　　「這也很好，就是又要麻煩嫂夫人了。」殷兄知道拙荊是成都人，立即贊成，且目視康公。　　「我也以爲尙可。」康公附議。　　「我否決！」楳女士反對，「我也有否決權呀！」　　「那麼且將吃飯問題擱置作爲懸案。看次電影如何？」我來打開僵局。　　「很好很好。」殷兄素主妥協，連連點頭。康公無影戲不看，趕緊拍手。　　「我要看京戲！」楳女士近來在學唱玉堂春，於京戲饒有興趣。　　「這倒也好，康公以爲如何？」殷兄說。　　「看京戲不如開留聲機。」康公冷冷的。　　「蘇康你怎麼的啦，我要你攤牌！」　　「何必何必，」我頗想做他她之間的橋樑。「我們看越劇罷。」　　「倒也不壞，只是我聽不大懂。」殷兄開言。　　「電影對白你難道聽得懂！」楳女士聲色俱厲。「所以我不反對看越劇。」殷兄趕緊補充。　　「我否決。」康公說時，閉上他那雙丹鳳眼。　　「該死的！」楳女士破口。我拉了殷兄一把，他立起身來想跟我走。　　「你們去開秘寗會議，協以謀我？」楳女士趕到門口，擋住去路。「我出錢　，你們倆元旦和我先吃北京館——永安公司後面的那一家，再陪我看玉堂春！」　　「怎好叨擾——」殷兄還沒說完，康公立起身來：「元旦我請你們兩位看好影片『無國遊民』，晚上大三元小吃。」　　「你捨得破鈔，省省罷！」楳女士披一披嘴，一面找開皮包來，康公不說話，只摸出錢袋。　　「改日再罷，」我只好宣布延會。逍遙花  陳慎言　　第六章　如此良宵（三〇）　　渚齋一聽這　，綺紈竟語帶醋意，想她不是愛我過深，不會說這話，因爲綺紈這句話，又勾引起對章雲卿的情感，自己從前旣辜負雲卿一片疾情，現在不要　蹈覆轍，再負綺紈的厚意。想着，心裏祗是難過，閉上眼睛，好似雲卿那副外冷內熱的面龐，就現在　　。小王媽見渚齋頭靠沙發上，閉上眼睛，一語不發，以爲剛才一句話說錯了，引起他不快，便不聲不響，悄悄走出去，到廚房內自行料理菜蔬。房內祗剩下渚齋一人，閉一會眼睛，又凝神一會，心裏祗是難過。約莫有半個鐘頭，門外一陣車鈴緊響，綺紈已回來，一到屋內，見渚齋一人悶坐椅上先說一聲「對不起」，隨把外衣脫下，對渚齋笑一笑道：「今晚還好，我父親並沒生氣。我把款子交上，也就收下，並對我說許多話，種種不放心，可見做父母的，是如何疼愛子女。我經了父親這一番談話，看老人家病在床上，非常難過，若不是和北洋戲院已訂了合同，決不去濟南了！」說時，眼眶一紅，小王媽急擰一把熱手巾送上。綺紈擦一擦。交給小王媽，小王媽又問道：「老板吩咐予備東西，可以端上來嗎？」綺紈點點頭，走進更衣室，過了一會，仍穿了那套大紅睡衣，趿着拖鞋，含笑出來。見酒菜已擺在桌上，說道：「你今晚和我喝幾杯酒如何？我向來不愛喝酒，不知怎樣，今天覺得非喝幾杯不可。祗今晚一宵，就要和你分別了！」渚齋一聽，立時舉起酒杯，對綺紈一揚道：「我祝你此去成功！」綺紈眉尖一蹙道：「成功不敢說，祗求不鬧笑話，能平安無事回來，就是萬幸。我父親只怕我出事，他期望我太切了，我很想努力，但是有時我聽父親的話，又未免過虎，忍不住會頂撞幾句，事後我又後悔。老人家是愛我的，是有見識的，我不應該離開他。」渚齋道：「這是你的孝心，我認爲老人家的見識，有時和我們靑年人相反，他所過慮的，我們重來沒關係，有時我們認爲很嚴重的，在他眼中看做很平談，所以父母親長的話，固然應該遵從，可是有時也應該斟酌合不合潮流。」綺紈道：「你這話很對，我也是這樣想。我愛我父親，但有時不合我的意思，我就駁他，所以常常因爲一點小事，吵鬧起來，這是我的缺點。」渚齋道：「這不算缺點，正表示了你是一個時代女性！」綺紈道：「像這樣胡鬧，還算時代女性，那末你可算是標準靑年了。」繡像重慶評話我們的下一代  白蕪文　龍生畫　　倘說延續生命是生物二大本能之一，這定律，今天在重慶是值得懷疑的了，至少不是無條件的。　　這是現實；面對着酷的現實，一切「親子之愛」，「天性」等等和它一接觸便成　粉。不談溫飽，生下孩子來穿吃總是要的吧，這是起碼的生存條件。然而在今天，已經在　飱難繼中的人，倘再添丁進口，便眞是「　住的衣角」，即使是生活戰塲上最勇的勇士，也就無法戰鬥，只有一同滅亡。爲了免於同歸於盡，對於新生命的幼苗，倘不施行人工流產，便只有棄去，由他的命去　，也許有好心人收留；而最殘酷——不，應該說最乾脆的便只有溺嬰。　　重慶在抗戰期間便被稱爲棄嬰最多的城市，有心人或認爲風化可憂，或認爲禮敎的吃人。其實被棄的往往是穿着襁褓的，倘是私生子，誰來替他做「催生衣」？能公開做孩子衣服，餵養多天，證明決不是爲了禮敎，掩人耳目。　　十一月底的一個早晨，我住的巷子裏發現一個提籃裝了一個生下已經月餘的孩子，穿了小棉衣，戴着小花帽子，在寒風裏發抖。顯然是扔了孩子，去當乳傭，免得母子一同餓死。哭聲驚動了我的老母親，然而搓着手想不出一個法了呌他活下去，急得她流了老淚。結果是着人提了送到法國敎會仁愛堂醫院，那裏是比較肯收棄嬰撫養的。那個白衣白兜頭的老尼收下之後，卻撇着法國音的重慶話，對我母親大罵「中國人貪歡樂，不要臉！」　　中國人也許很多不要臉吧，然而却不是這些孩子的父母。有以下兩個證明：據大衆晚報載：「北碚發現棄嬰四具，據查爲女工恐乳哺妨碍工作，乃作集體墮胎。」　　另一個消息是一個畫了二十年的漫畫家，上月太太生了個孩子，一下地，便送給鄰居做兒子了，原因是已經有了四個，第五個實在無法養活，而那四個已經深秋光着屁股了。億兆之外  張方仁　　最近滬上各報都有命數名詞的討論，問題在乎十進位與萬進位的分野。據各種字典所載：十萬爲億爲小數，萬萬爲億爲大數，考萬進位的歷史，有康熙御訂「數理精蘊」一書，把億兆兩位，訂爲萬進位，終有淸之世，談數字的人，無不奉爲圭臬。但遺憾得很，庚子賠款的數字四百五十兆兩，弄得也算十進位，也算萬進位，反而糢糊起來。　　民國三十三年十一月二十八日重慶中央日報刋載「億」字的規定，我國數位，係採十進制，數字大者則以億，兆，京，垓四字代之。國民參政會參政員張伯苓等，建議政府請明令確定數位，以萬萬爲億，今已由國府令行各機關通飭注意，萬進位遂成鐵案。「兆」字以上的定義，正可依此類推。　　分析命數名詞結果，「萬」以下的小數，是十進位，「萬」以上的大數，是萬進位。今鑑定命數名詞，分十進位和萬進位兩組，每組各舉列十二個名詞。　　小數有句成語：「至　至微」，故以「　」字爲始，自「　」位至「千」位，稱十進位組：十「　」爲「微」，十「微」爲「忽」，十「忽」爲「絲」，十「絲」爲「毫」，十「毫」爲「厘」，十「厘」爲「分」，十「分」爲「單位」十「一」爲「十」，十「十」爲「百」，十「百」爲「千」，十「千」爲萬。　　大數以「登峰造極」之「極」字壓軸，自「萬」位以上，均是萬進位，至「極」位爲止，稱萬進位組：萬「萬」爲「億」，萬「億」爲「兆」，萬「兆」爲「京」，萬「京」爲「垓」，萬「核」爲「秭」，萬「秭」爲「穰」，萬「穰」爲「溝」，萬「溝」爲「　」，萬「　」爲「正」，萬「正」爲「載」，萬「載」爲「極」，大數名詞至此爲止。　　　上面這兩組命數名詞，計在單位以下，共八位，計在單位以上，類推共得四十九位，如此龐大與微小數字，足够了一般社會學術上的應用。如德國馬克膨脹數字，在一九二三年歲末發行額，達二十一位數字，是四六九，五〇七，四二四，七七二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元；如疊用萬字名之，爲四萬六千九百五十萬零七千四百廿四萬七千七百廿萬萬元，這數字看上去糢糊之至；如易了上列的命數名詞，照爲四垓六千九百五十京零七千四百廿四兆七千七百廿億元。如地球的噸重，凌霄漢閣先生舉示數字，「一六」兩字，而圈則有二十六個，今以命數名詞稱之，爲一千六百秭噸，距離「極」字位數，尙差二十一位，若別具雙眼，正可以小天下了！一位紅作家的心得  文松　　美國現在最紅的小說家不是海明威或薩洛揚，而是一位我們不大熟悉的洛埃特道格拉斯。他的作品並不多，可是所得到的歡迎却是驚人的。第一部作品「大欲」，銷了五十萬部，那時還有人認爲不過是徼倖成功，但他接着又寫了一本「綠光」，又是銷到五十萬部！　　他的第三部小說「聖袍」出世，更是轟動全美國，一連九個月列爲暢銷書之首，譯成了十二種外國文字，據說已銷到一百七十萬冊，因爲消耗的紙張太多，那本書的發行者米福林書店竟不得不將發行權出租給別家書店代爲印售！　　道格拉斯一向是做牧師的，到了五十二歲才寫小說；一舉成名。別人問他成功的是什麼，他就提出了下列寫小說的決竅。　　他說，最要緊的一點，是小說開端的第一段決不可超過兩行半；第二段應當長一些，但不可超過三行半；第三段應爲四行半；第四段可以較長，但不可長得需要讀者翻到第二頁去。　　他對於讀者的反應一向研究有素。他說：「有許多書都是在第一頁上葬送了的，讀者一看見這部小說開端不好，就覺得是上了書店的當，白化了買書的錢。所以，你一定要一開頭就引起他的同情，這是最要緊的一點。」又說，每一章的開端不宜用對白；每一頁的開端需要特別小心，務求儘可能抓住讀者。　　他特別重視書裏的配角，主張使用他們一出塲就爲讀者所喜歡。新的角色出塲時，必須要做一點驚人之舉，愈危險愈好……　　當然，許多作家們對道格拉斯的「決竅」痛加抨擊，罵爲全部野狐禪，可是道格拉斯作品聽銷路蒸蒸日上，倒好像證明了這位「噱頭作家」所言非虛——而美國文化的特質，在這裏似乎也多少可以　一點。</p>

<h3>National Army in Dabie Mountains Continues to Suppress, Recaptures Susong and Guangji Separately, Navigation Between Hankou and Yichang is Now Smooth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The National Army in the Dabie Mountain area has continued to suppress the remaining bandits for days. The National Army in eastern Hubei launched a two-pronged attack, recovering Susong on the 29th and capturing Guangji. The remaining bandits fled north. Furthermore, a small group of the remaining troops of Liu’s Sixth Column, who were wandering near Jiajia Temple southwest of Luotian, were also fiercely attacked by the National Army in the area between Macheng and Tengjiabao on the afternoon of the 29th and fled north. Currently, the National Army is clearing the scattered bandits in the vicinity and dispatching strong troops to pursue and suppress them separately.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] More than a thousand bandits near Huangpo Station on the border of Henan and Hubei launched a surprise attack on Lishan at dawn on the 30th. They were met with a counterattack by the defending local forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits. The clash is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 30th Dispatch] Military News: (1) The 10th Bandit Column and Zhang Jian’s bandit troops in central Hubei were blocked while attempting to cross the Xiang River and have fled north towards Zhongxiang. The Luo Houfu bandit troops, who attempted to attack Jianli, were also defeated by the defending troops. (2) Liu’s First Column Headquarters has moved from Runan to Wanjia Shop. Some of its Second and Third Columns showed signs of concentrating in the Qianshan and Taihu areas on the 28th. Furthermore, the Sixth Column of bandits, entrenched between Huangmei and Guangji, has been cut into three groups, one of which fled east near Yingshan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 30th Dispatch] Transportation News: Navigation between Hankou and Yichang, which was previously blocked due to Luo’s bandit troops’ attempted attack on Jianli, has improved since the 30th, and ships have passed Jianli heading west.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhengzhou, 30th Dispatch] The majority of the bandits attacking Yancheng have retreated south. Currently, there are only about a thousand bandits within the territory of Luohe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Zhengzhou, 30th Dispatch] The Chen Geng bandit troops who attacked Yancheng suffered setbacks and fled south and southwest on the 29th. The National Army is currently suppressing the remaining bandits in Luohe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Bianhe, 30th Dispatch] After the local forces in Anyang launched a full-scale attack and suppressed the remaining bandits in the county, they recovered the important stronghold of Shuiye Town, more than forty li west of the city, on the 26th. They also eliminated scattered bandits in Fucheng, Jiang Village, and other places. The highway from Anyang to Shuiye is now clear and unobstructed.</p>
<h3>Lin Wei Reports on Military Affairs at the Executive Yuan, Emphasizing Achievements of the Past Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Lin Wei, Vice Minister of National Defense, reported on military affairs at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 30th for as long as two and a half hours. In addition to providing a detailed analysis of the war situation on various fronts, he also explained the plan to strengthen the suppression of bandits next year. He also specifically reviewed the military aspects of bandit suppression over the past year, emphasizing two major achievements: (1) The recovery of Yan'an, because Yan'an was the political center of the bandits, and after the Communist bandits lost Yan'an, they lost their basis and could not implement the overall situation. (2) After recovering Jiaodong, the north-south transportation of the Communist bandits was cut off, causing the bandits to flee south into Anhui and Hubei and reach the Dabie Mountain area. However, after the National Army established the North China and Central China Bandit Suppression General Headquarters, the military command has been unified, and now it is concentrating its forces to pursue the remaining bandits, and it is believed that the National Army can eliminate the bandits in the short term.</p>
<h3>Major Victory in Northwestern Shenyang, Fierce Battle for Xinlitun, National Army in Eastern Jilin Recovers Jiangmifeng Station</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Jilin, 30th Dispatch] The National Army's Eastern Jilin Suppression Forces recovered Jiangmifeng (about fifty li east of Jilin) on the Ji(lin)-Dun(hua) Railway yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 30th Dispatch] The National Army in the suburbs of Shenyang is on strict alert, and everything is peaceful. The National Army on the northwestern front launched an attack on the 30th, fiercely attacking Wanjintai, the main location of the bandit's Third and Sixth Columns, 35 kilometers northwest of Shenyang, annihilating and capturing a large number of them, representing a major victory in recent days. Near Liuhegou on the western front, more than 3,000 bandits from Zhangwu infiltrated at 2 PM on the 29th, and fierce battles took place at Fangjia and Lijia stations. More than 1,000 bandits infiltrated from Xinmin South Damin Village. The battle for Xinlitun is taking place in a brutal manner, with the bandits continuing to reinforce with over 10,000 troops. In addition, there are bandits entrenched near Xinglongdian between Shenyang and Xinmin, while Masanjiang, Yuguo, and other stations are being guarded by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The remnants of the bandits' Eighth and Ninth Columns in western Shenyang have been harassing the Raoyang River Railway Bridge between Xinmin and Dahu Mountain since the 25th.

Furthermore, the Lin Biao bandit troops' First Column, who infiltrated Liu Jiawopeng northwest of Faku, were defeated and scattered by the National Army's strong defense of the fortress on the 29th, leaving behind more than 400 corpses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 30th Dispatch] The scattered bandits who harassed the southwestern suburbs of Shenyang City have fled to the northwestern suburbs of Shenyang after being fiercely attacked by the National Army, where a major battle is brewing.

The blank certificates have now been prepared and shall be distributed to the Provincial Election Offices immediately and handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 55 of the Implementing Regulations of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law. For the certificates of election of representatives of municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, if they are mailed after being sealed by this office, there is a deep fear that they may be lost on the way, which may lead to malpractice. It is proposed to make a change and still send blank certificates, instructing the election offices of each city to affix two photos of the elected person in accordance with the provisions of Article 55 of the Implementing Regulations of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, affix the seal of the office, and affix the seal of the election office of the city and send them directly. The stubs shall be sent by the election office for investigation. These blank certificates of election are now distributed for reserve.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Rice Merchants in Siam Request Relaxation of Food Control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Bangkok, 30th Dispatch] According to the most reliable sources, representatives of our overseas Chinese rice merchants met with Siamese Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong on the 27th of this month and presented a petition requesting fair treatment for overseas Chinese rice mills. Nai Khuang's reply was: "I am willing to help you, but I am powerless." The Siamese government's rice control plan was originally scheduled to be implemented on New Year's Day, but it has actually been implemented. When the Siamese Prime Minister received Chinese reporters on Christmas Day, he promised to make changes to the above plan, but the Siamese Minister of Commerce ignored this promise of the Prime Minister at a cabinet meeting. He also stated that the reason why the Siamese authorities handed over the right to purchase rice to the Siamese Rice Company and other small rice mills was to reward these companies and factories for their faithful service to the government. Recently, some newspapers here reported that some giants among Siamese rice merchants (including the assistant manager of the Siamese Rice Company) were arrested for smuggling rice, which surprised all foreign observers. Representatives of our overseas Chinese rice merchants are now making a final effort for their survival. Representatives of our overseas Chinese merchants visited the Siamese Minister of Commerce again on the 30th, hoping that the Siamese government would make a minimum concession on the rice control law.</p>
<h3>China Should Be Allotted 30,000 Tons of Siamese Rice, Which Has Not Yet Been Shipped to China</h3>

The Siamese Ministry of Commerce has been slow to approve the transportation and export of this batch of rice for three reasons: (1) China and Siam are still negotiating the method of compensation. (2) Rice supplies in October were greatly reduced. (3) It has been proposed that 30,000 tons of rice should be transported by the American Relief Association, which is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>China's Iron Ore Exports to Japan to Begin in February</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Allied Headquarters announced that the Japanese Trade Bureau, under the administration of the Allied Headquarters, has signed an agreement with China to export 250,000 tons of "highest grade" iron ore from Hainan Island, China, starting in February next year and completing the shipment within the year.</p>
<p>This is the first time Japan has imported iron ore from outside Kanto after the war. Before the war, from 1930 to 1934, Japan imported an average of 947,000 tons of iron ore annually, reaching a record high of 5 million tons in 1940.</p>
<p>This Year's Tariff Revenue Exceeds Budget by More Than Two and a Half Times</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] This year's tariff revenue exceeded the budget. According to statistics from the Tariff Administration Department of the Ministry of Finance, as of early December, a total of more than 1.95 trillion yuan was collected. It is estimated that the annual revenue can reach more than 2.25 trillion yuan, exceeding the originally approved budget of 630.4 billion yuan by more than 1.61 trillion yuan, an increase of more than two and a half times. Since the implementation of import control measures in March, the amount of imported goods has been limited, and some unnecessary goods have been banned from import, which has greatly affected tax revenue. Tariffs have not yet reached the position of the first place in national tax revenue before the war, but this year's tax revenue is second only to the revenue from commodity tax and ranks second in national tax revenue.</p>

<p>U.S. Aid to China Plan Expected to Be Approved by Congress, Candidates to Host the Plan Undecided</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 29th Dispatch] Senior officials told United Press on the 29th that General Wedemeyer had not been mentioned for the position of hosting the U.S. aid to China plan in the future, and was not under consideration. As for discussing and deciding who will host this plan, it will not happen until the aid to China plan is submitted to Congress. All parties suggest that the aid to China plan will be approved.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Regarding the aid to China plan being drafted by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, which is preparing to submit it to the U.S. Congress in January next year, there is no news from the Chinese and American officials here. It is said that the plan is expected to include both economic and military assistance. The U.S. Embassy here has not had any discussions with the Chinese government, and the Chinese Embassy in Washington has discussed it. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense also know nothing about it. Some parties here believe that it is "unusual" for the U.S. State Department to draft an important aid to China plan without contacting the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing or the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Perhaps Marshall believes that all the information he currently has is sufficient to cope with it. Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan told United Press reporters last week that the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the U.S. government have discussed the aid to China issue, but it is not known whether it is about Marshall's so-called long-term plan or the 18 million emergency plan recently passed by Congress.</p>

<h3>New Year's Eve and Compassion</h3>
<p>--On the Student Fundraising Movement to Relieve Refugees</p>
<p>The eve of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, today, is upon us. In these difficult times, those who are fortunate enough to sit comfortably at home celebrating family reunions, amidst the atmosphere of lights and feasting, if they think of the countless compatriots who are still waiting for help in the cold and at the end of the year, as long as their conscience has not been extinguished, will surely be inspired by innate compassion. We only need to look at how young students have been running around and appealing for refugees these past few days to believe that all people share the same heart and the same principle. It is truly the so-called "a heart of compassion is something all people possess!"</p>
<p>This year's winter relief efforts in Shanghai were initiated early by the municipal government in October, followed by the municipal council's decision to raise funds. Various sectors of society then followed with a well-organized winter relief committee. Since its promotion, it has shown considerable results. It is said that the target of 60 billion in relief funds, due to the enthusiasm of all parties and the effectiveness of the methods, will not be difficult to raise in full within a short period of time. According to the original plan, setting up office accounts, providing porridge, distributing winter clothing, and establishing shelters are being carried out one by one. The 200,000 refugees in this city who urgently need relief will certainly be comforted and able to overcome their difficulties. This is truly a special event in this city this year, worthy of being prominently written about when settling accounts on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>On the streets, in residences, in restaurants and hotels, and in government agencies and organizations, one can see groups of three or five students everywhere. They hold small flags, carry the symbols of "Save from Hunger, Save from Cold," and reach out to the citizens to solicit winter clothing and cash. They have keen awareness, so they can immediately accept and respond to the municipal government's call to relieve refugees. Before the social mobilization had become widespread, their activities had already quickly unfolded. They did not wait for others to persuade them or for others to urge them, but immediately and voluntarily engaged in the work. They have sincere compassion, so they see the hunger of the refugees as their own hunger; they see the cold of the refugees as their own cold; they see the refugees sleeping on the streets, without beds or blankets, with many turning into corpses overnight, and they can no longer comfortably stay in their own dormitories without coming out to lend a hand to the refugees. These tens of millions of refugees came from bandit-controlled areas, having suffered the hardships of "struggle," "liquidation," and "massacre." Under the Communist bandits' "Three Alls" policy, these victims are experiencing the same fate as the elders and brothers in many of the students' own hometowns. This has sparked the compassion of young students, who see relieving refugees as relieving themselves. On the 28th, at the awards ceremony for underprivileged students held at the gymnasium, more than 2,000 students generously donated their 20,000 yuan refreshment allowance each, preparing to send it to the winter relief association for distribution to refugees. When this act of righteousness was announced, thunderous applause erupted. Only the poor truly understand the poor; underprivileged students relieving refugees is precisely the highest expression of compassion. The Chinese people are often seen as a cruel and selfish nation, and the saying "each sweeps the snow from his own door, and does not care about the frost on another's roof" is often taken as a portrayal of the Chinese people's selfishness. Originally, in the context of ten years of internal and external troubles, with murder as commonplace, it is sometimes inevitable that people become numb and lack the heroic spirit of public service; however, this is ultimately only a temporary and accidental phenomenon, and cannot be used to explain the Chinese national character. The vigorous development of the Shanghai winter relief movement and the spirit of selflessness shown by young students are both powerful rebuttals to this misconception.</p>
<p>Due to the simultaneous mobilization of students from various schools in various places, the fundraising movement is quite widespread, and its impact will also be very profound. If the citizens rise up and respond to and support this movement, the fundraising results may be excellent. Those in charge of relief may be encouraged by the youth and work even harder, quickly and effectively, so that the cash and goods donated by the citizens are all used for the benefit of the refugees. As for the tens of thousands of refugees, they will certainly benefit from it, take it as comfort, and reduce and overcome unnecessary troubles that may arise in the relief process--such as refugees not wanting to enter shelters, fake refugees taking the opportunity to profit, and unscrupulous people using the good name of fundraising to enrich themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the students' refugee relief movement, in the sense of human compassion, we not only have no reason to criticize it, but we should also encourage it. However, in order to truly relieve refugees and reduce unexpected malpractices, we would like to offer three points of technical advice regarding the fundraising work of various organizations:</p>
<p>First, our relief movement must be unified under the Winter Relief Association. The Winter Relief Committee is a comprehensive social organization responsible for hosting this relief effort. It includes all sectors of Shanghai, with fundraising, distribution, auditing, and an accountant's audit report, which can be trusted. Any organization should establish close contact with the association and be guided by it. Any organization's fundraising booklet, whether for goods or cash donations, should be obtained from the Winter Relief Association; the donated items, unless otherwise specified by the association, should also be submitted to the association for unified distribution work. This has two advantages: 　The items raised and distributed can be absolutely audited. In this kind of big city, malpractices are often unavoidable in the fundraising process. We cannot bear to see the pure enthusiasm of student fundraising sometimes suffer unjust accusations due to negligence in handling. If all fundraising work of various organizations is unified under the relief association, then this kind of possible error can be avoided. 　If all items raised by any organization are handed over to the relief association, then they can be distributed evenly and according to needs when distributed to refugees, so that there will be no duplication of supplies, and those who impersonate refugees to take advantage of the situation will inevitably know to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>Second, fundraising must be divided into districts for distribution. Most of the schools in this city are located in the North and West districts. If each school fundraises nearby or enters the downtown area for fundraising without a plan, it is inevitable that some areas will be heavily solicited while others will not be. This will not only affect the results of fundraising, but also make those who have been solicited repeatedly feel troubled, while those who have not been solicited feel that they still have items that cannot be donated. The other day, at a press conference, the mayor advocated that the collection of winter clothing should be carried out by district and distributed by district. This is a good decision, and we should do it this way.</p>
<p>Third, the wording of fundraising should be pure and simple; the fundraising methods should especially avoid harassment. Originally, "saving from hunger and saving from cold" stems from human compassion. Conscience and ability are triggered at the slightest touch, and there is no need for lengthy speeches. And what must be especially noted is that the psychology of Chinese philanthropists is that as long as the recipients of charity benefit, the donors can be comforted. It is absolutely impermissible to solicit donations from people on the one hand, while on the other hand saying that the view that former landlords in northern Jiangsu are becoming refugees is most likely to hinder fundraising efforts. Today, we only ask whether they are refugees, and we cannot ask about their past circumstances. If a small landlord of the past is now "struggled" to utter ruin by the Communist bandits, can it be said that he is not a refugee? As for soliciting donations along the road, asking for money from door to door, again and again, with one group going and another group coming, with endless solicitors and limited respondents, will it not make the general public feel harassed? It is permissible to donate willingly, but not to donate by coercion! Peaceful donations are permissible, but harassing donations are not!</p>
<p>Students' primary responsibility is to study. This time, being moved by compassion, they have stepped out of the school gates to engage in fundraising and relief efforts, which is highly commendable. However, as the winter vacation is approaching and the final exams are imminent, the students' fundraising work cannot last long. We hope that due to the students' enthusiastic fundraising this time, it will inspire more widespread and profound compassion among the citizens, and that they will continue this relief work until the expected goal is achieved. As the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, we sincerely appeal to philanthropists on behalf of the tens of thousands of refugees!</p>
<h3>Sun Yueqi Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discusses Issues such as Industry and Mining in the Northeast</p>
<p>Will Return to the Capital to Report on the Inspection</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the National Resources Commission, inspected industry and mining in the Northeast some weeks ago and flew back to Shanghai from Peiping yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. He will return to the capital to report within days. According to Mr. Sun, Director Chen and others have stationed heavy troops in the key industrial and mining areas of the Northeast. Although the situation in Shenyang is quite tense at present, the various industries and mines are still operating normally, and no preparations for retreat have been made, because suppressing rebellion is different from resisting aggression, and it is not feasible to consider relocating production. However, due to insufficient power fuel, many of the industries and mines in the Northeast have not been able to produce to their full capacity. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant originally planned to export 200,000 tons of steel this year, but this work has gradually stagnated since mid-May. The environment in North China is more stable than in the Northeast, and the various industries and mines are actively increasing production, with no other plans. As for Japanese reparations materials, the first batch is more than 9,000 sets of machine tools, totaling about 4,000 tons. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will send ships to Japan to pick them up early next month. These machines have been largely allocated, with 2,500 sets sold by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to private factories, 3,000 sets to the Ministry of National Defense, 500 sets each to the National Resources Commission and the Ministry of Communications, and 500 sets to the Ministry of Education. There was a previous proposal to relocate the Sino-Indian oil pipeline to the Yumen Oilfield, but it was abandoned because it was considered that the oil pipeline was too thin, with a working life of only two years, and it had already been used for more than a year in the past, so it would be worthless to relocate it again. China's uranium mines are located in Guangxi, the Dashiqiao area south of Shenyang, and the Beidaqingshan Mountains in Baotou, but given the current state of industry and science in China, it is still difficult to exploit them. I am unaware of the US plan to send an airborne uranium prospecting team to China. The National Resources Commission has agreed to return the generator of the Jiang Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to the Shanghai Huashang Electric Company, and to supplement it with the 5,000-kilowatt generator that will soon be transported from Tianmei.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Speaks on Regulations of Student Self-Government Associations</h3>
<p>Believes Criticism in a Certain Newspaper is Inappropriate</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education: the active significance of this revision of the regulations for student self-government associations by the Ministry has already been discussed by Counselor Liu Yingshi (that is, the remarks of the education authorities published in this newspaper yesterday). On the 29th, the editorial of a certain newspaper criticized the regulations, saying that the Ministry was preventing student activities. If students do not use their status to engage in illegal activities, the Ministry has no intention of preventing them. On the contrary, the youth's patriotic ideas and spirit of service are precisely what the Ministry pays attention to and cultivates. As early as the 19th year of the Republic of China, the central government promulgated the general outline for the organization of student self-government associations, which was suspended after the 24th year. Later, the Ministry of Education believed that self-government associations could train students to learn democracy, and in the 32nd year, it revised and promulgated the regulations for student self-government associations. This year, with the implementation of constitutional government imminent, there were some places in the original regulations that were no longer appropriate. For example, the original regulations stipulated that the directors of the association must report whether they were party members or group members, and that the general assembly should be replaced by the representative assembly. All of these required revision, and were therefore revised. The prohibition of participating in various extracurricular group activities mentioned by a certain newspaper was originally contained in Article 2 of the original regulations, and was not added this time. Because the student self-government association is a student organization, and the student's status is actually derived from the school, if they leave the school, they are no longer students. If the self-government association is allowed to participate in extracurricular group activities, it will be no different from ordinary civic groups, and should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and its regulations should also not be formulated by this Ministry. Regarding the stipulations that the student self-government association should be responsible for guiding the school authorities, and that its purpose is to promote virtue, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics, and that there should be five departments: learning, health, service, discipline, and affairs, all of these were clearly stipulated in the original regulations, and have been implemented for many chapters. However, a certain newspaper referred to them as newly created clauses and rashly commented on them, indicating that it had not carefully investigated past and current education laws, and was merely making inferences based on available materials, as a theory catering to young people. As for the section that student self-government association officials should be elected from those who have excellent academic performance and leadership ability, the newspaper would probably not advocate that those with poor academic performance and conduct be elected as any officials. In short, youth should be guided according to the situation, and they should also be trained to learn, so they should not be over-indulged. If they are allowed to be accustomed to manipulating, controlling, disobeying discipline, not respecting others, pleasing only themselves, and disliking those who oppose them while they are in school, and they develop habits, they will only reverse right and wrong and confuse black and white when they enter society in the future, and increase the source of social chaos. What kind of education would such education become? I am afraid that it will be deeply hated by the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Strike Wave Spreads at National Central University</h3>
<p>School Administration Meeting to Have Important Decisions Today</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The problem of student strikes at National Central University continues to expand. As of the 30th, 33 departments in the five colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, Engineering, and Agriculture, totaling 107 grades, have gone on strike. At 2 PM, they gathered in the dormitory, formed a team, held flags, shouted slogans, and marched to the university's Academic Affairs Office to petition. Then, they sent representatives to meet with Acting President Qi Shounan. The representatives put forward four demands and waited for the President's response. At that time, the petitioning students stood quietly in the square in front of the auditorium, waiting for news. After a long time, President Qi addressed the students, asking why the student self-government association, which opposed domination, wanted to dominate the university administration. All the students were extremely dissatisfied when they heard this, and immediately rioted and made a lot of noise. President Qi then declared that everything would be decided at the school administration meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, and the students began to disperse. The four demands of the students are: A. Withdraw the order to dissolve the department representative assembly and the standing committee. B. Withdraw the order to punish the standing committee members and department representatives. C. The school must not interfere in the election of the board of directors. D. Dean Sha Xue Ling should resign for dereliction of duty.</p>

<p>The Executive Relief Administration Formally Ends Today - UNRRA's China Office Ends Simultaneously - Rooks Sends Letter of Thanks to the President</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Relief Administration (ERA) and UNRRA's China Office will end today. The ERA formally announced yesterday: "Article 25 of the ERA's Organizational Law stipulates that 'The ERA should be abolished upon completion of the post-war relief work.' Now that the ERA has been established for three years and has managed the post-war relief supplies provided by UNRRA, the mission has been largely completed. From now on, relief work has been transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order, and post-war work will be taken over by the newly established Post-War Reconstruction Committee. In accordance with the above provisions, the ERA should be abolished immediately, and it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be concluded at the end of this year." Huo Binshu, the Minister of the ERA, and Cleveland, the Director of UNRRA, will hold a farewell meeting with all staff at the ERA at 3 PM today and deliver farewell speeches. However, if the two men are still in Nanjing and unable to return in time, the farewell meeting will be changed to tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Another Report] All vehicles from the ERA's South China, Central China, and North China branch offices have now been fully allocated, totaling 2,890 vehicles, including 27 in Kowloon, 340 in Guangdong, 384 in Guangxi, 463 in Hunan, 210 in Hubei, 258 in Jiangxi, 39 in Fujian, 128 in Anhui, 159 in Jiangsu, 463 in Henan, 245 in Beiping and Tianjin, and 173 in Qingdao. 1,045 vehicles are awaiting distribution in Shanghai, and the Ministry of Communications has taken 217 vehicles from the items stockpiled in Shanghai.

<p>Content of Rooks' Letter to the President</p>
<p>To President Chiang Kai-shek: Before the UNRRA's China Office closes, on behalf of UNRRA, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Your Excellency and the people of your country for your past cooperation with UNRRA in promoting UNRRA's work. Especially because your country has encountered numerous difficulties in the eight-year war of resistance, it is even more commendable to be able to cooperate in this way.</p>
<p>We believe that the US$133,251,000 worth of food that UNRRA has provided to your country can alleviate the famine. We are also pleased to hear that although your country's food situation is still difficult, it has improved greatly compared to 1945 and 1946. We hope that future rice and wheat harvests will be able to further reduce the degree of famine under the compensation of agricultural machinery and fertilizers.</p>
<p>Regarding medicine, we have also done our best to transport and aid your country in order to save lives. In terms of post-war reconstruction, UNRRA will provide US$166,742,000 for industrial and transportation purposes, and US$72,460,000 for agriculture. I am pleased to hear that your government has decided to organize a Post-War Reconstruction Committee to continue to promote reconstruction work.</p>
<p>The staff of our office in China and the people in Washington have all found it very pleasant to work with your government and the ERA, especially admiring the arduous work of Chiang Tingfu and Huo Hezhu, the two Directors. Finally, I and all my colleagues wish your country the early achievement of reconstruction and nation-building.</p>

<h3>Wallace Announces Presidential Candidacy as Independent Candidate - Delivers Speech Attacking Current US Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 29th] Former US Vice President Henry Wallace delivered a nationwide radio address tonight, declaring, "I am running for president in 1948 as an independent candidate." Wallace said, "Today there is a greater threat than ever before, the seriousness of which is unprecedented in human history. This threat can be overcome with a new political lineup. The new political lineup requires the organization of a new party. I hereby announce that I will participate in next year's US presidential election as an independent candidate."</p>
<p>Wallace also announced his platform, stating, "Universal military training is the first step towards fascism. We will do our best to fight it, and we will fight against all congressmen who support it. The new party must implement a vigorous plan for abundance and security, not a plan for poverty and war. If we can prepare for peace on the same vast scale as we prepare for war, we can prevent economic decline and war. Countless Americans have asked me to engage in this great struggle. The more votes for peace in 1948, the more the world will understand that America does not support the bipartisan reactionary warmongering policy that is dividing the world into two armed camps, which will inevitably lead to American soldiers lying sideways in the Soviet snow in cold-weather clothing."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chicago, 29th] Neutral political observers believe that the main result of former US Vice President Henry Wallace joining the presidential race will be to greatly reduce President Truman's chances of re-election. Wallace attacked military aid to China and Greece as contributing to the high cost of living in the United States. He said: "The American people have already read in the newspapers about Congress passing absurd appropriations for military adventures in Greece and Turkey, and billions of appropriations for arming the United States. This is gradually making us realize that these newspaper headlines have become a part of our daily lives. We suddenly realize that we cannot involve the people of the world in the next great war, and we must enjoy less food, clothing, and housing conveniences in our daily lives."</p>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 29th] Henry Wallace is 59 years old and from Ohio. He was originally a Republican, but he supported Democrat Al Smith in 1928 and the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Wallace served as Secretary of Agriculture in Roosevelt's first two terms and then as Vice President and Secretary of Commerce in Roosevelt's third term. In 1946, he was dismissed by Truman for publicly opposing former Secretary of State James Byrnes' hardline policy towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Truman Feels Threatened After Wallace Joins Race - Democratic Party Political Machinery Shaken</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] President Truman's hopes for re-election have been dealt a major blow after Henry Wallace decided to run for president. Wallace intends to work for Wallace in industrial areas, and Truman cannot afford to lose votes in industrial areas. Wallace plans to run in New York, California, and Illinois, which account for 90 votes in the national electoral votes. Only 266 votes are needed to win the presidency. However, not all of Roosevelt's New Deal faction support Wallace, and labor unions do not support him either. So far, only the Communist and Illinois Progressive parties are supporting Wallace. However, Wallace does not hope to win next year, but has a long-term vision for 1952. [United Press, Chicago, 30th] The Democratic Party's political machinery has been shaken after former Vice President Henry Wallace declared yesterday that he would run for president as an independent candidate. According to political figures, since Wallace has criticized the so-called "bipartisan reactionary warfare policy," presidential candidates from the Democratic and Republican parties will have to respond during the campaign.</p>
<h3>Wallace Resigns as Editor of The New Republic Weekly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 29th] After resigning as editor of The New Republic Weekly, Wallace will continue to be a contributing writer for the weekly, writing one page each week. It is reported that before Wallace resigned, Michael Straight, the publisher of The New Republic magazine, had a disagreement with the magazine's editor, Henry Fairlie, over Wallace's future position, and Fairlie also resigned.</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Still Supports Truman's Re-election</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] It is generally estimated here that Truman's chances of being elected next year have improved over the past twelve months. This change is partly due to Americans' satisfaction with foreign policy. The results of the election on November 2 next year cannot be predicted until the Republican Party puts forward its candidate. However, Truman has clearly secured the Democratic Party's nomination, which is almost certain. Before 1947, the Republican Party, which was defeated by the Democratic Party in the elections to both houses of Congress, was generally believed to be able to maintain its advantage until 1948, and Truman's political outlook was extremely pessimistic. In the face of congressional hostility, Truman won the assistance of Marshall and implemented a foreign policy that the people loved. On domestic policy, he vetoed congressional bills and fought with the Republican Party, and in other matters, he made it his top priority to win the hearts of the people. Truman further improved relations with Mexico, Canada, and Brazil, reorganized the Western Hemisphere defense, and responded to Europe with the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. The American people feel that the policy towards the Soviet Union has become "tougher," and both parties support "anti-communist actions."</p>
<h3>Michael Abandons Throne - Romania Declared a Republic with Government Completely Controlled by Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 30th Broadcast: Reports from Romania state that King Michael of Romania announced his abdication on Monday, and the Communist-controlled cabinet immediately declared Romania a "People's Democratic Republic." Michael delivered a radio address, stating that he was abandoning the throne for the benefit of the people, because the changes in the situation had made it necessary to amend the constitution, and the people must have the right to choose their own form of government. All cabinet members signed the declaration announcing the Romanian Republic, and Parliament is meeting to approve it. It is reported that after King Michael fell in love with Princess Anna of Switzerland, he asked the Gheorghiu-Dej government for approval, but Gheorghiu-Dej refused, because the Romanian Communist Party clearly did not want Michael to marry a member of a foreign royal family. The main reason for the King's abdication is probably this. It is widely believed that Michael will soon announce his engagement to Princess Anna.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Exchange Views on German Reparations - First Batch of Goods from Soviet Zone Distributed to Ten Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Britain and the United States will soon exchange views on the US plan to stop supplying reparations materials from West Germany to the Soviet Union. Although Britain will not affect Washington's decision on this matter, it is expected that Foreign Secretary Bevin will still adhere to the statement he made in the House of Commons after the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, that is, Britain should continue to pay reparations materials from the British zone. Although the United States has not asked Britain to change its position, since the economic policies of the British and American zones are already cooperating to a certain extent, the two countries should first reach an understanding on the adoption of different policies on the issue of reparations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The French Foreign Ministry announced that the Allied Reparations Commission in Brussels has distributed the first batch of goods from the German territory under the Potsdam Agreement, which are nominally called exports, to ten countries: Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Egypt, and India.

<p>[Reuters, Athens, 29th] Reliable sources here say that if the rebel government in northern Greece is recognized by any foreign government, Greece can immediately obtain foreign military aid for self-defense, as stipulated in Article 51 of the UN Charter. The British, American, and Greek governments are actively consulting in an attempt to prevent the rebel government from being recognized by foreign countries, as they believe that this recognition will be the first major step towards escalating the conflict. Greece will regard foreign recognition of the Greek rebel government as equivalent to an armed invasion of Greece.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 29th] The United Nations Balkan Commission today passed a resolution stating that any foreign government's recognition of the government led by Greek guerrilla commander Markos will be a threat to international peace and security. The Finance Committee today announced that France plans to expand its army to 323,800 men next year, an increase of 39,200 men compared to this year.

<h3>Deteriorating Soviet-Iranian Relations Show Possibility of Diplomatic Rupture</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 29th] The "Republic Daily" here believes that diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Iran will be severed, because Soviet-Iranian relations are deteriorating and Iran will never be able to meet the Soviet Union's demands. The "Portrait Daily" claims that the re-appointment of Hakimi as Iranian Prime Minister under Soviet threat has greatly disappointed the Soviet Union. The newspaper also believes that the subversive actions currently being carried out by the Comintern, including the establishment of a puppet government in Greece, can be called the second international Communist offensive after the general strikes in France and Italy. Under Hakimi's leadership, the Iranian government maintains its consistent resistance to Soviet annexation.</p>

<h3>Katayama Broadcasts to the People - Determined to Establish Democracy and Resist Communism - Says Japan Will Take At Least Fifty Years to Recover</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama recently assured the Japanese people in his new message that he will fight communism to the end, and will strive to expel capitalism from Japan and establish a democratic socialist weapon. According to Katayama, democratic socialism does not allow capitalism to coexist with it. He continued that it will take at least fifty years for Japan to recover from the destruction of the war. He encouraged the Japanese people to seek self-reliance before seeking foreign assistance. A Chinese sage said, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." Katayama refuted the conservative slogan that "the Conservative Party is the only organization that can defeat the Communist Party," and said that the new Conservative Party's attempt to subdue the Communist Party is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Finally, Katayama warned the Japanese not to cherish the glory of the past victors, but to recognize the fact that Japan has been completely defeated.</p>
<h3>Spain May Be Included in US Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters Correspondent in Washington, 29th] According to authoritative sources, although the claim in the London newspapers that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France have agreed to allow Spain to participate in the Marshall Plan for European aid cannot be confirmed, there is actually no reason not to allow Spain to participate. However, the sixteen European countries participating in the Marshall Plan must first accept Spain's participation, and Spain must guarantee its determination to participate in the joint effort to rebuild Europe. People here believe that the more trustworthy countries that participate in the European Reconstruction Plan, the greater the hope of success for the plan. If Spain participates in the European Reconstruction Plan, its contribution and its gains will be equally significant. Due to Spain's political relations with most other countries, it does not seem that the outside world will advise Spain to participate in the Marshall Plan, but Spain's political philosophy is not more repulsive to the United States than that of certain two or three Central European countries, and the United States has already expressed its hope that those two or three countries will participate in the European Reconstruction Plan.</p>

<h3>銀樓刦綁案獲犯單身大盜首度受審足跡遍大江南北·起解曾脫逃追獲</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yan Xiongfei, the lone bandit who committed a robbery and kidnapping at a jewelry store, was brought to court for his first trial yesterday. Yan, 25 years old, is from Qiqihar in Northeast China. He has traveled extensively throughout the country. He rented Room 2 at the Asia Hotel, using the alias Yang Haitao, and also posed as Cheng Wei from the Second Section of the Economic Investigation Division of the Police Bureau. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, he falsely claimed to be an economic investigator checking for black market gold and currency. He went to Fang Zijin Jewelry Store at 386 Henan Road, brandished a gun, and demanded four gold bars. Zheng Yuxiang, the store accountant, told him that there was only 2 million Legal Tender in the safe. Yan took the Legal Tender and, still unsatisfied, kidnapped Jin Chuxiang, a store employee, as a hostage, instructing them to prepare the gold bars for ransom. Shortly after Yan left, he contacted Fang Zijin by phone and negotiated the ransom down from four gold bars to six taels of gold. Yan instructed them to exchange the gold at the entrance of the Great World. Fang Zijin Jewelry Store then reported the incident to the police. The police apprehended Yan at the entrance of the Great World. After being taken to the police station for investigation, Yan confessed that he was also responsible for the robbery of three gold bars from Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store on Henan Road. He was directly transferred to the District Court on the 26th of this month for trial on charges of special criminal banditry. Presiding Judge Wu Shaochang ordered him to be detained. At around 7:00 PM, when the bailiffs were escorting Yan and over 40 other prisoners to the detention center on Sinan Road, Yan broke free from his handcuffs as the truck was leaving and attempted to flee. However, the bailiffs bravely pursued and recaptured him. Yesterday, Yan was brought to court in handcuffs and shackles. Judge Wu Ronglin presided over the trial. Yan claimed that he came to Shanghai from the Northeast and intended to start a business with a friend, but lacked capital. He then went to Nanjing to visit friends and seek employment, but was unsuccessful. He sold his wedding ring and returned to Shanghai, still unable to find a solution. He was forced to resort to this desperate measure. On the night of the 12th, he initially planned to rob Qiu Tianbao Jewelry Store, but the store manager was not present, and no one was in charge. He then went to Fang Zijin Jewelry Store to rob it. After the interrogation, he was returned to custody and the trial was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<h3>錢江通航前夕　一個可喜的展望</h3>
<p>The Eve of Qiantang River Navigation: A Delightful Prospect</p>
<p>Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] Hangzhou, this city, will soon leap to an important position, thanks to the full opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the navigation of the Qiantang River. Since the establishment of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, the first step has been to keep the tides eight li outside the seawall, the second step has been to stabilize the riverbed, and the third step is the upcoming navigation of the Qiantang River. This is truly good news for Zhejiang, and even for the Southeast and the whole country. The navigation of the Qiantang River was planned by people long ago. As early as the West Lake Exposition in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the Nanyang Promotion Association had a ship that sailed from Shanghai along the Qiantang River to Hangzhou, but it almost ran aground several times. Since then, people have not dared to try to navigate the river. It was not until January 1, 1947, when the Pine (潘恩號) of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) sailed from Shanghai to Hangzhou, followed by the Tugger (脫格號) on January 24th of the same year, that people's interest in the navigation of the Qiantang River was rekindled. Thanks to the Seawall Engineering Bureau's continuous efforts to stabilize the riverbed and keep the water flowing, on August 21st of that year, 20 wooden barges were towed from Shanghai to Zhapu by the No. 8 tugboat of the ERRRA Water Transport Brigade, and then taken back to Hangzhou by the Tugger, including three wooden barges, one iron barge, and two small motorboats.</p>
<p>The Seawall Engineering Bureau has again used water diversion to prevent the water from flowing away. As a result, when the tide is low,</p>
<p>The Qiantang River's water level</p>
<p>is 6 meters from the riverbed, and even near the shallowest Tashan (誤稱　子門處), there is a permanent water level of 2 meters. According to the water level statistics of Fuyang and Haining counties, the low water level has negative values, and the negative number of the riverbed is even doubled. Therefore, as long as the draft of the ship is less than 2 meters, it can navigate the river. Now, a 5,000-ton ship requires a draft of 24 English feet, and a 300-ton ship requires a draft of 51 English feet. In this way, the 300-ton ship can navigate immediately, which is no problem. The 5,000-ton ship can also navigate when the water level is high. As long as the riverbed of a 3,000-ton ship is continuously stabilized, navigation will not be a problem. Now we want to study</p>
<p>What are the benefits</p>
<p>of navigation after it is opened? After navigation, the rice, porcelain, and water products produced in Jiangxi, the rice produced in Hunan, and the timber, rice, cotton, tea, cloth, and medicinal materials produced in the upper eight prefectures of Zhejiang can all be transported to Hangzhou via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and then transported to Shanghai and other places by water. Originally, many goods were transported to Hangzhou by wooden boats and rafts, and then transported to Shanghai and other places by train, or still by rafts and wooden boats. Now, the Qiantang River's navigation has been opened, which can quickly and in large quantities</p>
<p>Facilitate the flow of goods</p>
<p>without the need for such long and troublesome journeys. Similarly, many products from Shanghai and other ports can also be transported to the interior for exchange.</p>
<p>According to statistics, in August 1947, 1,629,754 kilograms of rice, 155,000 kilograms of cotton, 976,040 kilograms of vegetables, 952,935 kilograms of tobacco leaves, 567,798 kilograms of tea, 20,020 kilograms of medicinal materials, 218,500 kilograms of paper, 367,480 kilograms of cotton fabrics, 52,490 kilograms of silk fabrics, 550,092 kilograms of cotton yarn, 197,020 kilograms of cigarettes, 535,571 kilograms of sugar, 175,783 kilograms of fish and seafood, and 1,258,710 kilograms of wood were transported via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Including all other goods, the total amount transported was 8,782,723 kilograms. According to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's transport capacity to Hangzhou, the number is said to be 3,000 tons, so the combined number is quite large. Moreover, there are many goods that are not transported by rail. Therefore, if the Qiantang River is navigable, its economic value is particularly large. At the same time, because of the navigation between Hangzhou and Shanghai, it can also be navigable between Hangzhou and Wenzhou. In this way, we do not have to transport many goods through Shanghai, and its value is even greater. At present, the problem of navigation lies in the people who implement it. The China United Company is willing to invest</p>
<p>to operate navigation</p>
<p>, and the Asia Industrial Company will invest with two 3,000-ton ships. If the operation is fast, we can do it in the spring of 1948. The reporter specially interviewed Zhu Zushun, the person in charge of China United Company in Hangzhou, about this matter. He told the reporter that he is now investigating the value of freight and the amount that must be invested. In his opinion, if the Qiantang River is navigable, the goods can be placed in the warehouse at the dock, and the bill of lading can be used for mortgage financing. This is a convenient and very economical thing for business. According to his rough estimate, the initial investment will be 20 billion yuan. He plans to set up a dock in Xixing, because there he can transfer the goods transported by water from the upper reaches to the outside. He plans to go to Wenzhou. Assuming that the Shanghai-Hangzhou route is 300 kilometers, it will take 20 hours. The two ships will travel back and forth every day, that is, from Shanghai to Hangzhou, to Wenzhou, and then from Wenzhou to Hangzhou and Shanghai, for handover in Hangzhou. He said: "This is a very interesting thing. However, it is bound to lose money to open up Zhijiang Bay. The freight must be cheaper than the railway freight. If the navigation goes quickly, it can be implemented in two months." We are very happy to look forward to the navigation of the Qiantang River in the shortest two months, because this can connect the blood vessels of the south and make Hangzhou's economic status particularly high!</p>

<h3>吳興菱湖鎮一角　教育的綠洲</h3>
<p>A Corner of Linghu Town, Wuxing: An Oasis of Education</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Wuxing, 26th] Zhejiang's agricultural education is developing rapidly, especially at a time when education is feeling difficult, and a small oasis has been discovered. In Linghu Town, a small town of only 8,000 people in Wuxing, a commendable central model primary and secondary school has emerged, and they are intensifying</p>
<p>the work of eradicating illiteracy.</p>
<p>Chairman Shen of this province has always attached great importance to education. In April of this year, when Chairman Shen inspected Linghu, he greatly praised the agricultural construction of Lingzhen, but at the same time, he earnestly pointed out that education cannot be ignored. Linghu originally had a Qingshu Primary School, which was unfortunately dissolved during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, Mr. Zhang Rongchu, the original founder, resolutely took on the economic responsibility of its restoration alone and specially hired Mr. Pan Gongzhan as the chairman to actively carry out the school's reconstruction, which has reached its current scale. Linghu is a water town,</p>
<p>the soil is fertile and the water is beautiful. Although the place is small, it should also be prosperous. Qingshu Primary and Secondary School is located in the south of Lingzhen, with a good environment, surrounded by water on three sides, covering an area of more than 40 mu. As soon as you enter the school gate, you can see neat trees and newly built school buildings, which are clean and spacious. The school's auditorium is quite large and magnificent, and can accommodate more than 1,000 people. It is said that more than 3 billion yuan has been spent on building these school buildings in February this year. The students who come here to study</p>
<p>are completely free, and many come from other towns as boarders. The total number of students currently is more than 1,200, and the total number of school-age children in Linghu Town is now about 3,000, which means that almost 50% of the children have books to read. In the neighboring villages of Linghu, there are also 13 branch schools, with a total of more than 1,000 students.</p>
<p>On the 13th of last month, educators Hu Huaitian and Pan Botang from Shanghai visited the school. They were surprised by the completeness of the equipment here, which is not inferior to the best primary schools in Shanghai. In addition to the sports fields for basketball, volleyball, and track and field, there are also four special classrooms for science, art, music, and manual labor. No one would believe that there would be a new-style large grand piano in this Popular Music Room. The school's library now has</p>
<p>a collection of tens of thousands of books, and there are also the Complete Library and the Siku Quanshu for teachers to use for further study. In addition, the children's science and plant and animal laboratories are also very interesting. The school's infirmary is quite complete, specializing in checking the physical condition of students and teachers, treating diseases, and carrying out vaccinations on time.</p>
<p>Qingshu currently has 45 teachers, most of whom are graduates of universities or normal schools. In addition to teaching, they also focus on cultivating children's practical abilities and noble styles, leading students to run self-government associations, and often holding speeches, calligraphy, and cleanliness competitions. Because this is a rural school, and most of the students are children of farmers, the atmosphere is very simple and honest.</p>
<p>The founders of Qingshu and the staff of the school are not satisfied with the existing scale, and they are carrying out an extremely large</p>
<p>development plan. They are preparing to build new secondary school buildings and plan to run vocational schools to train junior technicians in sericulture, silk weaving, and accounting. In this way, the number of primary school students can be increased to 2,500 or 600. In this way, almost all the children in the town can have books to read. We sincerely hope that this school will continue to develop in the future. For the construction of a town school, although it only benefits one place, we hope that this trend of promoting education will spread widely, so that the blessed are not only this town, but the whole province and even the whole country.

<h3>Twelve Experts from American Overseas Consultants Arrive in Shanghai to Inspect Water and Electricity, Chemical, and Textile Plants; Industrial Association Holds Reception to Welcome Them</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A group of twelve experts (and four women) from the American Overseas Consultants and a liaison officer from the Chinese Compensation and Return Committee arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo at 1:30 PM yesterday. The Overseas Consultants, composed of thirty engineers and experts from New York and New England, are commissioned by the U.S. Army Department and the State Department to investigate the Japanese reparations issue and study how to revive the Japanese economy. Under the leadership of Group Leader Schrick, they have been stationed in Japan since August of this year. Four months of investigation work has given them sufficient data to submit reports and recommendations. These recommendations carry a lot of weight and will affect the overall U.S. attitude towards the Japanese reparations issue.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they will take the route through South China, passing through the Philippines and Pearl Harbor to return home. However, they also have an incidental mission to see if Chinese industry has the ability to absorb Japanese reparations materials, so their observations are very relevant to our national interests. The twelve guests include electricity experts, steel experts, shipbuilding experts, chemical experts, and coal and iron ore experts. One is the chairman of the Allocation Committee under the Far East Commission.</p>
<p>Inspections in Groups After Lunch</p>
<p>The leader is Mr. Wysor (R.J. Wysor), the retired president of the Republic Steel Company in the United States, who has worked in the steel industry for 43 years. He is very familiar with the steel situation in any country in the world except the Soviet Union. They took off from Tokyo at 8:00 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM. After being treated to lunch by the Compensation Committee, they immediately split up into groups for inspection. One group visited the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, another group inspected the Tianyuan Chemical Factory, and the third group visited the Shenxin No. 9 Factory. The fourth group consisted of a group of ladies who visited the city of Greater Shanghai, which may have been of great interest to them! The cocktail reception was also delayed.</p>
<p>Japan's Recovery: Not Fast</p>
<p>From 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM in the evening, the Industrial Association held a cocktail reception at Rong Hongyuan's house on Seymour Road to welcome them. In addition to Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, about 60 well-known figures from the steel, electricity, chemical, petroleum, machinery, shipbuilding, transportation, textile, and financial industries were invited. The atmosphere was very harmonious. Mr. Wysor seemed to have a good attitude towards Shanghai, saying that everything here was much better than he had expected. When talking about the speed of Japan's recovery, he repeatedly shook his head, saying that it was not fast because of the coal shortage, which is a global problem.</p>
<p>Going to Beijing by Train This Morning</p>
<p>The guests will travel to Beijing by train this morning and have an important conversation with Mr. Weng Wenhao. On New Year's Eve, they will make a special trip to Shanghai day and night. On the morning of New Year's Day, the whole group will visit the Central Shipbuilding Corporation and the Zhanghuabang Wharf. Their short visit will end like this, and if they have time in the afternoon, they may visit several companies and shops to learn about Shanghai's prices. If the weather is good on the morning of the 2nd, a special plane will take them to Hong Kong and then return to the United States. What is the impression of these guests on Chinese industry? What are their own opinions? These are all unknowns. Mr. Wysor made it clear: "I personally have no opinion to express on this matter. Our report will only be drafted after returning to the United States and submitted to the U.S. government for reference." This is also the only answer that can be obtained.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Stealing and Selling Military Uniforms; Wang Deyun and Others Suspected of Corruption; District Attorney's Office Files Indictment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wang Deyun (also known as Wang Xiaodi), Zhou Yangting, Wang Zhaomei, and others were indicted by the District Attorney's Office yesterday on suspicion of corruption. According to the indictment, Wang Deyun's sister is the stepmother of Gu Zhuoxiang (also known as Gu Yuexian). Gu held a military supply position at the Taiwan Air Force Command. In mid-September of this year, he was ordered to go to Nanjing to collect military uniform material. Gu entrusted Wang Deyun to deposit the material in the Dalai Huaji Nanhua Bank in this city. Then, in late September, Gu colluded with Wang Deyun and went to the bank to take out two bundles of the military uniform material, which Wang sold, and handed over more than 20 million yuan to Gu. Later, the Taiwan Air Force Command discovered the matter and detained Gu Zhuoxiang. Gu then committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The command telegraphed the Air Force Supply Command, which in turn asked the city court to send police to arrest the accomplice Wang Deyun. Wang Deyun's father, Wang Zhaomei, and Zhou Yangting jointly hid Wang Deyun. Zhou Yangting also issued a certificate stating that there was no such person as Wang Xiaodi and handed it over to the bailiff to mislead the court. Later, the District Attorney's Office arrested Wang Deyun and detained him. After investigation by the District Attorney's Office, the defendants were charged with violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption and Article 3, Paragraph 1, Section 2 of the same regulations as accomplices. The military uniform material was embezzled and is to be recovered or confiscated in accordance with Article 7 of the same regulations. The actions of the defendants Wang Zhaomei and Zhou Yangting clearly constituted the crime of being accomplices to Article 164, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and an indictment was filed according to law.</p>
