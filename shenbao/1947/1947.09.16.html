<h3>立院復會首次會議　批准對義和約條文　公務員貸款案交付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院十五日晨舉行復會後第一次會，出席立委約八十人。孫兼院長主持，各委員新自各地考察憲政歸來，睽別兩月，歡叙闊契。會中通過要案有：（一）批准對義和平條約，（二）批准中英空中運輸協定，（二）經部工業試騐所組織條例，（四）修正內部組織法第廿六·廿七條條文，（五）動員時期軍人及其家屬優待條例，（六）修正僑委會組織法。此外與選舉有關之案件亦有修正：（一）國大代表名額分配表內各縣市及同等區域選出之代表，（二）江西立委選舉區劃分表，（三）安徽立委選舉區劃分表，（四）不分區之各省市立委名額分配表，（五）立院立委選舉罷免法第九條條文及修正立委選舉罷免法施行條例第九倏條文等案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院復會後第一件大事爲批准一九四七年對義大利和平條約。此一條約系本年二月十日在巴黎簽訂，盟方參加簽字式有中·蘇·英·美·法等廿個國家。條約共分十一部，九十條，並有十七個附件，十一部要目如下：（一）領土部份，（二）政治條款，（三）戰事罪犯，（四）海軍陸軍及空軍條款，（五）同盟國眾隊之撤退，（六）由戰事引起之要求，（七）財產與權利及義務，（八）一般經濟關係，（九）爭議之處理，（十）各種經濟條款，（十一）最後條款。第二部政治條款中第五章爲中國之特殊利益，內共三條，廿四條規定義大利向中國放棄「由一九二一年九月七日在北平簽訂之最後議定書，與一切附件補充之各種換文與文件所產生之一切利益與特權」，並同意該議定書附件換文與文件就有關義大利部份予以撤廢。同時義大利並放棄因此而引起之任何賠償要求。二十五條規定：義大利同意取消中國政府所准給義大利天津租界之租約，並同意將該租界市政府之各種財產及檔案移交中國政府。二十六條規定：義大利向中國放棄在上海，厦門兩地公共租界義方所有權利，並同意該兩地公共租界應改由中國政府治理。此案十五日於立院三三三次例會提出後，首由外交委會委長戴修駿報吿審査經過，繼由孫九錄委員發言，鄭重指出條約中所謂「中國之特殊利益」，「特殊」二字全不確實，蓋我國於條約中未得絲毫特殊利益，盼會中能將此點列入紀錄。此案略經討論即無異議通過批准。會中另一重要外交案件爲中英空中運輸協定。此一協定早於七月廿三日正式簽訂，立院外交·經濟兩委會亦曾審査通過，今日於會中提出後，全體無異議通過批准（全文見七月廿四日本報）。此外與外交有關之案件爲積極迅速向葡國交涉收同澳門案，此案立院三二八次會議通渦後，即呈報國府，經國府飭據政院呈復轉據外部核復，一俟時機成熟，當再提出交涉收回。此案由樓秘書長於院中報吿時，谷立委咸表滿意？</p>
<p>〔又電〕立委劉志平·陳顧遠等五十人所提一擬請政院舉辦公務人員生活貸款，以資救急而提高工作效率案」，於今日會中提出後，各立委踴躍發言，僉認公敎人員生活之淸苦有難以想像者，政府對於此輩掙扎於饑餓綫上之基幹人員，亟應加以援助。原提案人劉志平首先起立說明此時此地上下固應共體時艱勵行節約，然節約兩字不能僅責之於生活萬分困難之公務人員。劉指出若干達官貴人，住高樓大厦，出入汽車、僕從如雲，一切皆由國家負擔，與輾轉溝壑之公敎人員相比，實欠公平。盼能於萬分困難中，籌謀救濟。簡貫三指掛：（一）招商局經理除由公家供給汽車洋房外，月薪可得千五百萬，較院長且多一千萬。吃苦不足畏懼，惟須求得其平，懸殊過甚，足以影響行政效率。黃右昌提醒各委員，藥醫問題亦亟待解決，渠友人中受生活高壓患病後無力治療而死亡者，前後已有多人。此事實不容忽視。鄧鴻業舉出覃副院長逝世後，身後蕭條無以爲葬之故事，沉痛呼籲。生爲今日之公務員生不得，病不得，活不得，死不得，厭狀之參，言之酸鼻。陳顧遠·陳海澄等皆有辦法提出，最後以此案有詳加研討必要，決議先交財政。經濟兩委會審查。</p>
<h3>商聯有關選舉啟事　立委認為公然詆毀　決議交下次立院大會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕全國商聯會前因對職業代表名額分配問題表示不滿，曾於京滬各報刋登廣吿，對立法院大加攻擊。立院十五日晨復會後首次會中，各委員對商聯會公然侮辱政府機關，咸表憤慨。此案係陳委員顧遠臨時提出，渠詢問全國商聯會於報端刋載大輻廣吿，公然詆毀政府機關，國家是否尙有法紀？周一志當衆宣讀廣吿原文，認爲文句荒謬辱及全院人格，不能不有表示。陳海沒指出，主管機關坐視此種行動，不予糾正，令人不解。劉不同認此事僅係少數人之行爲，平。津等地商聯會對此毫無所知，主張建議國府，解散商聯會。衛挺生，鄧鴻業等認全國商聯會刊登此廣吿前事先並未開會，故此事應由少數人負法律責任，並應由主管商聯會之社會部澈査，社部未能予以制止，亦難辭其咎。最後以該事涉及刑法及商法問題，決議先交刑法，商法兩委會硏究，再交下次大會討論。</p>
<h3>整肅選舉風氣　應組織監察團</h3>
<p>立委洪瑞釗談普選</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕記者今晨往訪立委洪瑞釗，叩詢對此次普選意見。洪氏爲參加起草行憲十大法規之一人，最近甫自浙江原籍返京。據談：本年普選爲我國有史以來第一次，本人係新聞記者出身，此次返浙，一面以採訪新聞之方式聽取民間輿論，一面以近代民主的作風，參加競選。計在浙東各縣，先後公開講演，並出席各種座談會不下廿餘次，並與農工領袖及工商文化界人士，對選舉問題交換意見。本人所得之初步觀感，約有下列二端：（一）各地競選風氣，殊未令人滿意，而威迫利誘，及酒食徵逐等現象，仍極普遍，尤以負責機關之徇私凟職爲最甚。此種現象，往往非普通法律所能糾繩。本人認爲欲防止選舉舞弊，須訂頒單行法規。同時本人正建議中央，應遴選監委，立委，參政員及各黨中委以不參加競選者爲限），組織巡廻監察團，迅速分赴各省市嚴密監察，以整肅選舉風氣。（二）本人係國民黨黨員，此次中央所頒指導黨員競選辦法，乃係對黨內之一種必要措施。由此可徵當局決策之賢明。今日中央當局對于辦理選舉，大抵能公忠體國。苦心籌計，惟本人在浙東所獲印象，深覺中央意旨或不能完全貫澈下層，同時各地國民黨員違背命令利用職權之事實，亦已數見不鮮。興念及此，良堪憂慮。爲維護國民黨紀律起見，除現頒各種法規外，似應採取進一步之嚴峻措施，方能保障中央法令之執行，否則選舉前途，將不堪設想。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十五日是電〕美大使司徒雷登博士十五日稱：中美政府關於聯總結束後繼續工作之談判，中美雙方在南京進行，短期內即可獲致協議。大使對政府十四日發表對魏德邁使團提出之聲明，拒絕發表意見，惟稱：美人固願視中國之和平團結民主與戚强，美人亦甚欲竭其所能協助中國，此原則決無變更。大使最後稱：「渠正以最大興趣，注意最近政府之改革，」並稱：「此項改革，乃朝向正確方向之進展」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕蔣主席雖在其對共黨作戰中對美作新呼籲要求援助，然美國對華再予以援助問題，十五日仍未決定。蔣主席十四日經由駐美大使館發出警告稱：渠之剿共戰爭之成功與失敗，不獨決定中國之前途，並且牽涉整個遠東之安全。美國務院發言人認爲，蔣主席之呼籲，爲一適當其時之動議，因美國對華政策現正在熱烈檢討下，但渠等力稱：在魏德邁本週中返美以前，對華政策之未來途徑，尙未作決定。杜魯門總統本週末自南美返國後？預料魏德邁將向總統提出渠之建議。又悉：中國現送交美國進出口銀行之各項計劃，總數達三億美元之多。</p>
<h3>我防止通貨膨脹　須凍結國內游資　外國觀察家發表見解</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕外國中立派觀察家稱：中國通貨膨脹，物價開始再度飛漲，政府如欲根除，其唯一有效方法，必須凍結國內游資，以免不時作祟，擾亂民生。產米區收穫雖甚富饒，但本市米價近數日來上漲幾達百分之五十。八月份外匯一度穩定，茲亦追踵而起，此種不需要之食米漲價，主因厥在投機囤積，合法商業旣受條例限制，無從發展，囤積遂成游資之出路，囤積即加速物價上漲，日本游資現亦為麥師下令凍結，中國如欲收節約</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕此間財政當局稱：中國政府現擬使中國人民存在國外之外幣匯還國內，估計總數約在三億與十億美元之間，但恐效果甚微，此項措施業經全國經濟委會通過，現惟待明令公布，此間多數財政觀察家皆認爲，在現行情形之下，尙不能實行此項法令，若干評論人士則謂：政府提出此項建議之動機，乃爲政治資本，而非財政資本。關於英美銀行拒不提供中國存戶名單一事，中國官員今已公開加以抨擊，認爲如此勢必使此一計劃歸於失敗。</p>

<h3>關內外貿易決廢除差價　採以物易物辦法　東北與台省交換物資尙難實現</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十五日電〕東北與關內購貨　納差價辦法，當局即將予以廢止，今後採取以物易物辦法。東北五金出口貿易，訂定繳納差乎價辦法，係於關內外貿易開始時，東北與關內物價相差極鉅，東北五金運至關內後，可獲厚利，由商人利潤內酌取差價。唯自入岌以來，東北物價波動極大，目前有超過關內物價之勢，商人運至關內貨物，獲利無多，如再繳納差價，不但無利可獲，且有虧本可能，此種辦法，繼續存在，對關內外貿易殊有阻碍，故有關當局會商後，決議購貨繳納差價辦法決予取消，採取以物易物辦法。今後進口商家，必須由關內運來經委會指定之物資、方可換得東北五金許可輸出證明，出口貨商亦須以物資易取關內物資，方准出口，唯以物易物之價値，必須相等。至於易貨種類，關內貨物爲棉紗，棉布，米，麵，白糖等日用品，關外貨物爲元鐵，三角鐵，竹節鋼等五金器材。</p>
<p>〔又電〕東北台灣物資交換，事實上尚多困難，東北物資調節委員會前派往台省之該會設計委員潘車生，頃由台返瀋，據談東北與台灣交換物資事，經多方接洽，一時尚難實現。蓋因台省內所有之枕木，悉由交部直接支配，他省需要時，需先呈請交部核准，始能運出，糖則因目前台省存量並不太多，係準備外銷，換取外匯，故短期內不能運來東北。至於東北之五金，目前台省所需者僅爲最薄之鐵板，該項鐵板自東北運出，價格並不十分合適，肥料雖爲台省大量需要者，但聯總運去之肥田粉，數量已不在少，其價較廉，效用亦較佳，至東北豆餅產品，仍須在上海謀求銷路。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>全國對外貿易會議之舉行</h3>
<p>全國商會聯合會發起之對外貿易會議，昨日在上海舉行開幕式，今日卽進入討論階段。此次全國對外貿易會議的召開，以商聯暨工商界爲主體，，集全國工商鉅子經濟學家於一堂，共同檢討今後對外貿易大計，誠爲當前發展對外貿易聲中的一件大事。</p>
<p>我國自抗戰勝利，政府實施貿易統制政策以來，整個對外貿易活動，發生了臃腫麻痺現象，無從回復正常，以言進口，輸出管理委員會管制了進口貨和外匯，祗有洋商與少數商行，纔有結匯的利便，而進口貨又偏於奢侈品和不必要物資；以言出口，政府旣缺乏獎勵輸出的政策，而出口商又在幣制不穩，利率高昻，原料騰貴，運輸不便諸種限制之下，掙扎無出路，與整個工業生產同陷於不幸的命運。由於進出口活動的偏差，管制辦法的畸形，入超月月有增加。一方面，國內市塲被外來奢侈品佔去了，有限的外匯滾滾消耗於無形：另方面，出口貨市塲日益狹隘，甚至南洋市塲已立脚不住，結果出口貨無路走，出口商無路走。所戰利便者，僅僅若干特殊貿易公司或企業公司之類，乘外匯變動之際，先得風聲，因出口貨之囤積而坐獲暴利，於國計民生無補。這是我國對外貿易的危機，全般經濟的大危機。</p>
<p>政府看凖了這一點，正力謀挽救當前的危機，所以「經濟改革方案」，特別强調「政府應以有效之方法鼓勵輸出，以謀對外貿易漸趨平衡」。並規定進口貨採輸入限制政策，「除生產工具原料及圖書儀器外，應設法嚴加限制，以節省不必要外匯之支出」同時對進出口貿易採連鎖制度，及輸出推廣政策，規定「出口事業應予積極獎勵，可由政府收購物資，以利出口，或指定若干物品，用進出口連營辦法，務使增加出口抵償進口」，以挽救入超。這兩項原則，當然不能包括全部對外貿易政策，如果眞有決定，眞有辦法推行，則畸形的管制可變爲合理的管制，輸入輸出便可以取得平衡，不致再演一面臃腫一面麻痺的現象。現在，政府對外匯管制放寬尺度，並謀實施輸出推廣政策，是爲了經濟改革配合而行的貿易政策的改革。但這決定不够，推行不够，尚待至大至遠的努力。</p>
<p>全國對外貿易會議，適於此際在上海舉行，自有重大的意義。我們希望此次貿易會議，能綜合學理和事實，制定富有建設性的方案，建義政府。其一，實施進口管制，必須限制奢侈品及不必要物資的輸入。其二，實施出口獎勵，必須樹立輸出推廣改策，幷配合運用進出口連鎖辦法。其三，外匯管理，必須要確實做到不浪費，而生產工具文敎用品的進口，確又需要合理的外匯開放。此外如同業組織的健全，國際貿易與華僑貿易的述繫，全國對外貿易機憐設置的必要，都是有關發展劉外貿易重要的議題。全國對外貿易會議集工商鉅子經濟學家一堂，不乏有經騐有學識之士，希望此次會議的成就，貢獻政府採納施行，有助於政府對外貿易政策的確立，及我國對外貿易活動的發展。</p>

<p>最重要者乃特里埃斯特自由區，因義和約之生效而誕生，由於自由區總督人選尚未經安理會決定，故根據義和約附則第七項，其臨時政權仍繼續由盟國軍政府管理。軍政府所管轄之盟國軍隊，即英美南三國駐在自由區之部隊各以五千人為限，義大利在特港區之主權即時停止。盟軍撤退期限亦自今日開始，義境之英美軍，保境之蘇軍均應於九月十五日起之九十日內撤畢，蘇聯得在匈羅境內保持若干軍隊，以艦護其通至奧國之交通綫。</p>
<p>義殖民地年內解決</p>
<p>義殖民地之處置亦於今日起一年內由英美蘇法四國作最後決定。四强特別代表會議不久將在倫敦舉行討論，準備由四强更高級當局就義殖民地作最後決定。前敵國之陸海空軍，應於今日起之六個月內，减至和約所規定之數量，惟義海軍之裁减限期則爲九個月。前敵國之過剩戰具，應於今日起一個月內移交盟國或銷燬。義大利亦於今日起之十八個月內，將奪自阿比西尼　之古物文件及一切具有歷史性價値之物件歸還阿國。</p>
<p>盟國監視和約執行</p>
<p>和約雖未明文規定羅匈保三國之盟管委會及芬蘭境內之英蘇聯合軍事團應於何時結束，但英國認爲此等機構，應於對各該國和約生效之日起即時結束。各和約均規定關於和約之執行以及因和約所產生爭端之解決，首先應交諸强駐在各該國之大使處理，故在羅馬者爲英美蘇法四國大使，在巴爾幹各國者爲英美蘇之政治代表，在芬蘭者爲英蘇兩國公使。</p>
<p>義剩餘艦四國瓜分</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十四日電〕四强海軍委會今日已抵達羅馬，分配義國過剩軍艦之工作，至此乃告開始。該委會係於蘇聯批准對義和約後正式成立。根據英美蘇法所簽訂之附約，蘇聯自義獲得分配而得之軍艦後，應將英美於戰時借給蘇聯之軍艦歸還英美。英美所借給蘇聯之軍艦，計有：英國所借者主力艦一艘。驅逐艦七艘。潛艇三艘。美國所借者有巡洋艦一艘。據悉，義政府曾向四强中之若干國要求放棄根據義和約可以獲得之若干義艦。馬歇爾業已表示美國至少可放棄一部份其名下之義艦，渠並料英國亦能採取同一行動。同時義大利對於義艦隊之被瓜分，莫不表示憤慨。</p>
<p>五國應償賠欵數字</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十五日電〕和約規定五軸心附　國應賠款十三億三千萬元。義大利應賠款三億六千萬美元，並割讓非洲屬地約三千方哩，保加利亞雖未喪失領土，但當賠款七千萬美元。芬蘭向蘇賠款三億美元，削　貝特　　省，並將貝卡拉島特租備予蘇聯，作爲海軍基地，定期五十年，羅馬尼亞亦向蘇聯賠款三億美元，並割讓貝　拉比亞，匈牙利則割讓外錫爾凡尼亞予羅馬尼亞，並賠款三億美元。</p>

<h3>食油直接配油店　免輾轉抬高市價　社會局向中信局建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先爲本市食油供應間題，於昨日面謁吳市長，並建議中信局，請對目前之配油方式加以考慮。據吳局長與記者談：當食汕聯配處存在時，中信局之配油係直接配于汕店，發售市民。根據各油店之實銷數量並調查其營業情形，故配量有一定限制，油店無法儲藏，此舉使油市塲及販連商人不能得利，但市民則獲實惠。自聯配處撤銷後，中信局之配油改爲直接配予油廠，汕廠則以該項配油於市塲拋售，自由賣買，油價遂被越抬越高。油店經售之食油須向市塲搜購，如此輾轉經手，加上行佣，市塲費用，油廠等利潤後，發售予市民之油價遂增高多多，獲利者則純爲油商。故建議中信局恢復過去直接配予油店之辦法，否則，如仍照目前配油方法，吳局長認爲油價不能下跌。</p>

<h3>血腥猶存兇熖未消　姦佔女敎師·槍殺議長　主犯孫濬伯第二審　判處死刑？減刑？日內即將揭曉</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十日航訊〕以姦佔女敎師槍殺參議長等一案五命而馳名全國之陝南鎭安縣前縣長孫濬伯，前被地方法院初審判處死刑，不服上訴。孫犯於八日於陝西高等法院辯論庭上，磨黨揮拳，時而繪聲繪影，時而激昂嘶吆，以力辯彼與女敎師王慧敏係合法結婚，並稱王之死並非服毒，孫犯又稱：該縣參議長李維翰死前有販賣鴉片行爲，證據確鑿，「此土豪劣紳平日放貸高利，魚肉鄉農，且欲把持縣政，製造私人武力，藏匿大批軍火，蓄謀暴動。」「李死了，鎭安人民除一大害。」惟對於當日親率縣府衛士帶同省府視察馬卓然前往李宅之槍殺事件，則諸多狡辯，力圖卸責，其「動人」之矯揉造作供詞曰：「我身爲革命軍人，且是縣長，勿論李是否被我打死，我亦</p>
<p>責無可卸我死，請立即行刑！此案累及我之部下（按指其衛士）多人判死刑，馬視察判徒刑，寃哉枉也！中國要主張人道，不然，中國永遠有問題！」「第一審地方法院起訴書謂予首先開槍，該檢察官簡直草菅人命！」孫犯辯詞歷一小時半，說來頗似一「演說家」，故擠擁如罐頭沙丁魚之數百旁聽者，始終屏息靜聽。孫犯之</p>
<p>主要證據為王女生前死後與其雙親間之通信及李議長之私人來往函件，然均非最近始提堂之新證物，其中若干語句，誠或可能作對孫有利，然所述亦未盡有利於孫。　孫之衛士楊保君，楊緒堂，對第一審判處死刑，均表不服，又云：「我等身爲榭士，請問「衛士」兩字作何解？設若庭長有衛士而遭遇刺客時，衛士應如何處置應急？」言下</p>
<p>老淚縱橫，作倀者於今應有後悔矣。</p>
<p>王死後孫被縣人檢舉而省府派往實地密查之視察馬卓然，兩月無光，精神萎頓，供詞亦軟弱凌亂。彼劈頭第一句說：「我無罪。我無任何武器，何能殺人？孫尙且不認殺人，我何能敎唆殺人？」說及當日隨同孫濬伯往李宅門首，即遭遇雙方）</p>
<p>互發亂槍時，「其時，間不容　，我若當塲拍好照片作爲今日之證明，恐早已無命，也不可能於今日在此作供，而且連，述，……」「運」了半分鐘，才接落下文：「連今天飯也吃不成了！」沈默之旁聽者，至此報以首次之哄堂大笑。對於解案至法院前在省保安司令部之若干供詞，馬仍否認，其中有一句關鍵語，即「殺個把縣長，嘸關係嘛！」一句，矢口不認曾作如此供詞，並謂在保安司令部作供時，出自威逼。</p>
<p>樊末世及其妻張天貞今亦出庭，樊原爲鎭安靑年團籌備主任，依第一審判處，樊夫婦協助孫誘引王慧敏往鎭安成姦，判徒刑三年。樊不服，此次上訴歷舉反證，認爲</p>
<p>孫王結合係雙方自動，彼等夫婦並未參與介紹或拉攏，因王孫係舊相識，孫在西安時，王搬行李至孫旅舍自願偕程赴鎭，張係趁便隨程同往；孫王二人在途中已親熱異常；「王曾半夜起來替孫蓋被子」。到鎭安後，王當晚即投宿縣府，未宿靑年團，張夜晚往探視，知彼等已喝醉，再往，衛兵吿以「縣長已同太太睡着了！」翌晨，王飭人到靑年團部取回行李，同日下午，宣告結婚。</p>
<p>王之老父王先舟却咬定樊夫婦不能辭其罪，蓋樊曾函誘王女往鎭安名爲在靑年團找工作，她抵鎭安後一切背乎</p>
<p>原定計劃之行動甚至死訊，樊並不通知王氏夫婦，故不得不認爲串同詭騙。</p>
<p>被吿律師一一申辯，然最足驚異者：厥曰「殺人者不必處死，蓋報復主義之刑罰早已過去。兇手處死，此乃漢奸共匪之計耳！」</p>
<p>减刑乎？維特原判乎？第二審結果，不日即可揭曉。然有一事足堪一述者：即被吿諸兇犯均感新聞界對彼等施予言論上之壓力，甚且認爲輿論之督促，致令司法者亦難公平宣判云云！（記者麥葉）</p>

<h3>胡適大學計劃　平學者發表意見</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕胡適之十年大學敎育計劃發表後，頗引各方注意。記者以此詢諸此間數敎界名流，承各述其意見如次：</p>
<p>胡先驌</p>
<p>（一）靜生生物調查所所長胡先騐，認爲胡氏此意見相當對，所舉五大學也相當好，不過漏掉中山大學似有毛病，因中山大學有相當好的規模，加以整頓，可成爲一流大學，故不妨先舉出六個。此外還應當定出若干二流大學。如南開，師大，中正等大學，皆可列入，同時助其發展，俾使之　於一流。關於以留學生外匯，作發展數大學經費，胡所長主張可移用其一部，但不可偏頗。</p>
<p>陸志韋</p>
<p>（二）燕大代按長陸志韋，以第三者立塲。認為國家集中力量發展幾個大學，當無不可，但尙非時機。並認爲胡適估計的外匯數目太多。蓋留學生中，大多數是自費，旣不許其出國，當無須列入其外匯。惟考諸實際，留學還有必要，蓋以我國社會環境，往往不能與學科配合，例如經濟學，中國社會就不能作此學科的背景，而在美國就配合得上。「中山」「中央」等大學，誠然朱辦好，但這是受了限制，如吳有訓是很可以辦好學校的。</p>
<p>袁敦禮</p>
<p>（三）師院院長袁敦禮，認原則上贊成胡適計劃，但謂實際上經費與交通等條件，將限制此計劃的實施。（四）北大敎務長鄭　熾，完全同意胡適計剷，渠深感政府一年給北大的一萬五千美金，連買雜誌都不够。渠認若干學科固需借重外人但渠知有很多美國或別國的好敎授願意來中國，且有若干人已在接洽中，故如經費足可充實，幾個大學的設備辦好，可無問題。對於鄒魯質問胡適中山大學問題，鄭氏稱　　以廣東人立塲，負責指責中山大學尙朱辦好。</p>
<h3>交大整委會　本週內結束</h3>

<h3>全國對外貿易會議　昨晨舉行揭幕式　出席各單位　代表一五五人　大會通過上蔣主席致敬電</h3>
<p>全國對外貿易會議，十五日晨九時卅分，在仁記路中國銀行大禮堂舉行隆重揭幕式。出席江·浙·贛·陜·晋·川·豫·湘·寗夏·台灣·遼寗·滇·魯·渝·平·津·漢·靑·等十九雀市，曁南洋·墨西哥·等地華僑商會，及全國工業協會，全國進出口貿易協會，全國工商協會，中國國際經濟協會等三十三單位代表一百五十五人。來賓有吳市長，經濟部劉次長，及英國滬商會主席約翰。凱士威克。美國滬商會理事長却爾斯，陶　斯等。大會由王曉籟·吳蘊初·徐寄廎·壽景偉·駱淸華·張禹九·陶桂林·王繹齋·黃再壽等任主席團。</p>
<p>首由總主席全國商聯會理事長王曉籍致開幕詞，略謂：「我國目前對外貿易問題，僅一串亟待解決之經濟問題中一環，除對日貿易問題外，餘如對美·英·南洋·印度·澳·菲·蘇·法·等貿易問題及外匯關稅等問題，均値得吾人之深切注意，至貿易政策之如何適應實際需要，貿易同業組織之如何健全，對外貿易陣綫之如何力求堅强，以及貿易經勞方式現代化之切實推進，尤爲全國進出口同業之亟需詳加討論，以謀解決者。全國對外貿易會議，以此目標而舉行，定期三日，參加會議者，包括工商金融各界領袖及專家，此項會議由民間自動發起召集，在吾國尙係創舉，希望切實討論後，溶朝野意見於一爐，達到上意下宣，下情上達之目標。吾人希望政府方而與工商界方面，均能就（甲）管制進口，（乙）獎勵出口，（丙）開放外匯，（丁）推展進出口連鎖制度方面認淸目標，勇往邁進，則不獨貿易界之幸運，亦即整個民族經濟之一大轉機。</p>
<p>壽秘書長報告</p>
<p>大會秘書長壽景偉報吿籌備經過，並聲明兩點：（一）此次全國對外貿易會議在滬舉行，承行政長官及各地代表前來參加，殊表榮幸。尤望墨西哥及南洋等地國外代表多多說話，使陝內人士充分明僚僑胞貿易情形，（二）截至目下止，大會收到提案六十六件，已報到者有三十三單位，代表一五五人，（原定代表）二二人，又追加三十三人。）壽氏並希望政府在此次會議後，（A）配合國策，積經保育民族幼稚工業，勵行全國對外貿易總動員。（B）確立輸出推廣政策，挽敎入超危機。（C）創立貿易行政機構，健全同業統制組織。（D）增進國內商業組織，與華僑貿易界之密切連繫。（E）保障外商投資利益，推進國際經濟合作。</p>
<p>吳市長致詞</p>
<p>吳市長致詞，略謂：「上海爲全國商業金融中心，如無對外貿易，上海即無今日之地位，如對外貿易中心轉移，上海繁榮亦難長久保持，對對外貿易之興衰，實與中國整個國計民生有密切關係。凡此各問題，在座諸君均爲專家，不必贅述。但大會在滬舉行，本人以地方官資格，願以門外漢資格，貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>無論論討論何種問題，在此內亂未平期間，總屬困難重重，吾人在此環境內，應注意一前提，即「凡事求之在我，不求在人」。吾人討論一切問題，須自本身先行檢討，剛才主席談及目下工商界現况，提出成本增高之幾點原因，此項原因，政府雖有一部份責任，但工商界本身須檢討改進者亦甚多，吾人必須開誠合作，摒棄私人利益，而爲整個前途着想。</p>
<p>中國目下一大癥結，即爲大家訴苦而不謀解決之道，若干人士提出之計劃雖好，但在現在環境下，往往要求過高，實行極爲困難，故吾人討論一切問題，應以「卑之無高論」爲原則，一切改革計劃，先自小處着想，必須顧及是否可能做到自本身開始脚踏實地，逐步做起。工商界向爲切實工作者，本人相信此次會議所討論者必爲切實問題，對發展對外貿易，必有切實之帮助。</p>
<p>劉次長致詞</p>
<p>再次經濟部劉次長泗英致詞，略謂：全國各地代表濟濟一堂，討論對外貿易問題，相信會議之結果，將決定性地影響政府對外貿易政策，意義殊爲重大。此次會議所討論重心，爲獎勵輸出及進出口連鎖等原則，及技術問題。關於前者，本人在經濟部立塲，願與工商各界合作獎勵輸出，其目標不但希望平衡出入，並盼進而穩定國家預算。至進出口連鎖，技術方面有若干需要先決之問題，吾人希望能硏討辦法，努人克服困難。再如勞資問題，吾力希望雙方密切合作，以便集中力量，發展對外貿易。政府對民間並無隔膜，更無成見，希望今後朝野打成一片，如赴日商務代表名額等，各界如有意見，可儘量提出，以便以後考慮調整，日本對外貿易目下正在逐漸恢復，吾人能容忍其自給自足，但不能容忍其發展野心，以壓倒中國貿易爲目襟。但吾人急起直追，不僅政治問題，並爲經濟問題，必須全國各界密切合作，始能獲得完全成功。</p>
<p>英美來賓致祝</p>
<p>全國經委會委員潘序倫，詳加檢討中國之由貿易問題，及種種客觀事實之困難，一再强調市長提出「自求振作脚踏實地」之意見。美國滬商會理事長陶默斯，則關述外商在華投資問題，對金融，工業，原料各方面均曾詳加檢討。英國商會主席凱士威克則希望加强國際合作，發展各國輸出入貿易，並盼此次大會能獲圓滿成功。</p>
<p>代表申述願望</p>
<p>此後墨西哥華僑商會代表鄧秋三，中國進口商業同學公會代表張禹九，南洋華僑商會代表桂華山，台灣商會代表黃再壽，貴州商會代表游述銘等，均分別致詞：南洋代表　華山，特別提出日貨已再度侵入南洋市塲之嚴重性，希望全國朝野密切注意。台灣代表黃再壽則聲述三點。貴州代表游述銘繼之致詞，後最全國商聯會常務理事王繹齋代表該會致詞後，即由大會秘書長壽景偉宣讀上蔣主席致敬電，當塲修正通過。十一時半散會，由四行二局一庫假原地招待出席代表。</p>
<p>電蔣主席致敬</p>
<p>茲鎮其致敬電全文如次：「國民政府主席蔣鈞鑒，建國開始，經偉萬端，惠工通商，最爲當務之亟。本會議此次由全國商會聯合發起召集，在滬舉行，萃集各省市曁華僑商會代表，及工商領袖。與經濟專家於一堂，對於歐美，南洋，印度，日本及其他重要國家之各項實際貿易推進方策，曁如何與我民族工業密切配合，以及金融，外匯，運輸，保險等特種問題之積極改進，自當遵奉鈞座「同心拓業」之訓詞，與我政府所　經頒示之經濟國策，切實商討，以期由全國對外貿易之總動員，而促進工業化與農村經濟復興之實現。而國父實業計劃，亦可由主義而成爲實績，以仰副鈞座關懷對外貿易之德意，而達生產至上，輸出第一之任務。謹時肅電致敬，伏祈鈞鑒」</p>

<p>下午三時，大會在原址縱續舉行，按照議程，由各單位代表向大會報吿當地對外貿易情形，並提供意見。</p>

<p>次由進出口商業同業公會代表張禹九，及陳仲達先後發言。張禹九提出之口號，爲「中國對外貿易需要新政」認爲進口，必須以推動工業生產爲中心目標，出口必須以活潑農村經濟爲最大原則，故主張將工業分爲出口，民生，國計，基本四類，分別其性質而加以維護，仿效英國之「肌餓出口」政策，竭全力從事大量出口。渠幷分別就述輸，進口管制，金融，保險等四大目標，提出各種具體建議。</p>

<h3>民食調配委會　擬設立儲運處　收購白粳薄稻以備拋售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨稱：最近白粳薄稻價格之漲，係受產區影響關係。其中薄稻因貨少，價格尤高。現新米大量上市，尙須隔十餘天，待上市後即可回軟，平民食用之秈米則尙呈穩定。民食調配委員會，因鑒於所握有者爲洋米，在白粳薄稻上漲時，拋售不易收效。故擬乘此新榖登塲之時，設立儲運處，由中央銀行貸款，向產區收購白　薄熖貯存會調配會今後對平時之配米，仍以　米為主體，但如逢白粳薄稻有大波動時，亦即可以貯存之國米配售。該項向產區搜購事宜，由調配會委託米商代辦，因恐指定少數店家易蹈「糧貸案」覆　，發生糾紛，故委託米商業同業公會組織聯運公司代辦，由調配會給予合法利潤。現公會對此事之意見書尙未送局，如不願負責，則調配會將直接找商人委託少數店家辦理。</p>

<h3>從史的立塲　檢討近百年畫展之啓示</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>每一時代的繪畫，和當時的政治，敎育，經濟，風俗等，都有密切的關係。我們用歷史的眼光，去觀察繪畫的動態，無論是好是壞，是盛是衰，其在歷史上的地位和意義，是一樣有研究的價値。此次上海市美術館籌備處舉辦百年畫展，一般關心藝術運動的人，多以爲在此百年中的繒畫遺跡，極少精彩，爲什麼要特地發揚呢？不過就繪畫而講繪畫，這種懷疑，並非過分；就歷史的眼光，瞻前顧後，便覺得這百年來的繪畫，値得集合展覽，供關心藝術者的探討。</p>
<p>自從淸初皇室，利用繪畫來藻飾政治，所謂四王，最被推崇。一時畫史，爭相慕效，婁東，處山眞紅得和太陽一般。乾隆以還，揚州因地處南北運輸交通的衝要，成爲中國一個經濟中心。四方畫家多來獻奇鬥巧，爭名取利，於是有八怪的崛起。在　東處山以外，特樹異幟，也有相當的聲勢。因爲有這二大流派的激盪和吸引不宗四王，便學八怪，人人石谷，個個新羅，一味以「仿某家法」「師某家意」爲能事。不但不知上達，到後來，並所摹擬的四王或八怪，也得不到他一點氣息。這種流弊，到近百年中，表現得尤其顯著。除任百年，吳秋農，吳倉碩二三人外，差不多都是這流弊的犧牲者。</p>
<p>明季淸初，洋畫已跟着宗敎傳人中國，一時國畫，很受了他的影響；因爲不合國人傳統的賞　胃口，結果，沒有什麼勢力。近百年來，除宗敎宣傳品的洋畫外，東西洋名家傑作的影本，和攝取自然景物的照相機，源源流傳進來，一般畫史，未免見異恩遷，喜新嫌舊，爭相取法，倡言革新。但中外繪畫的情調，旣多差別；自然界和絹素間的溝通，也很困難；從事革新的技巧，又極幼穉；反弄得非驢非馬，對於繒畫的思想和見解，也陷於渾亂，使後起學者，彷徨歧途，無所適從。</p>
<p>一代畫風的振起，似乎也得有幾個有名位的大畫家爲之冠冕，爲之領導。唐宋元明，號爲一代宗匠的，差不多都是「紗帽」身分。近百年來，初因戡亂中興，崇尙功名；後因應付外患，競講洋務；名公巨卿，沒有一個是擅義繪畫，可爲一代宗匠的，就是有少數名位而愛好繒畫的，如翁同蘇，端方等，也不過逸筆草草，聊以寄興罷了。繪畫命運，都操在市井時史，江湖名流之手，或徒逞性氣，不知理法；或專事臨　，毫無生趣；或好逸從簡以爲高，肆意逞奇以爲雄；因此極少純粹的，博雅的成功者。</p>
<p>中國古代名畫，流傳很富，但是有的深藏內府，有的珍襲私家，從來沒有公開展覽，給大家觀　。那富於收藏的皇室和縉紳們，在這百年中，除了致力於記帳式的識錄，自誇富有，和便於賣買外；對於繪畫，殊少實際習作。顧西津尙能臨摹四王，實在是庸中皎皎。此外惟有一二爲收藏家的淸客們，尙能多所觀摹，少有成就。如陸廉夫，張子詳輩，還算是幸運的了。難怪其他大多數的少見寡聞的畫史，因藝術食糧的乏絕，而難於進步了。</p>
<p>同光兩朝，內憂外患，一年不如一年，國枯民窮對於繪畫。不但無暇提倡，且以爲非當務之急，多存輕視，一般能畫的，因經濟逼迫，多賣藝爲生；所作但求連成，不事精工，但求悅俗，不事崇古；於是造成粗率淺薄的　風，極少高古巨麗的製作。</p>
<p>因爲以上種種情勢的範鑄，形成百年來繪畫的局面、這是很明　而確實的。對於復興文藝負有　志的人們，要對症下藥，似不能不注重病游的檢騐。此次百年　展，就是搜集了許多病狀報吿　，供人診斷的。偕「前車之鑒」，作「識途之馬」，尋「復興之路」，此次百年畫展，給予我們的啓示，至少有下列幾點：</p>
<p>一·畫家對於一家一派，一味奴性的摹仿，終爲一家一派所犧牲。</p>
<p>一·革新繪畫，是要有相當的休養，深刻的認識，潛默的巡化，不是從破壞故舊的着手。</p>
<p>一·希望有名位的名公巨卿，富有藝術食糧，和藝術天才的，應該爲藝術努力，作時代的領導者。</p>
<p>一·希望古代名蹟，常有公開展覽之機會，俾大家欣賞觀摹。不要深秘固藏，失却保存流傳的意義和效用。</p>
<p>一·畫家的生活，是重精神，而輕物質的；畫家的生命，不限於眼前而延長於身後的，挨窮吃苦，是分內的事。不要貪利賤　，草率自棄。時代的一切壓迫，也會激增藝術精神的發揚，五代元季諸畫哲，是値得我們崇敬而效法的。</p>
<p>百年畫展，已經在十五日開幕了。這是百年來繪畫成績的總揭曉。希望大家去觀覽檢討；—比較前百年的繪畫怎樣？比較後數十年的繪畫怎樣？應該怎樣光大？怎樣改進？來啓發文藝復興運動的前途。</p>
<h3>近百年繪畫展覽會序</h3>
<p>— 李熙謀</p>
<p>考諸世界文明之發源，可分爲東西兩方，西方爲義大利半島，東方即爲我亞東大陸，中國採取美索八達米亞之文明，更會合印度文明，形成東方文化特有之系統。其於繪　藝術尤放　彩彩，意境旨趣，與西洋繪畫之寫眞逈然不同，實具我民族精神之獨特風格。</p>
<p>且我國文字以象形爲始，描摹島獸之跡，山川之象以成之，即書即畫未分焉！其後社會漸趨複雜，文字嬗變，繪畫乃分離而獨立，漢魏六朝繪畫之古樸醉厚，每於今日考古發掘之銅器石刻見之。蓋南齊以前之繪畫，輪廓線條，設色敷彩，與印度寺院之　畫，同一作風。晋唐以後，書法進步，講求筆姿，崇尙風韵，繪畫又與書法重趨一致，運用書法之筆姿神韵，入之於畫，故其形式雖殊，而其意趣精神則一貫聯繫也。</p>
<p>宋元之際，繪畫旣呈蓬勃之象，人物山水，花卉各科並進，繪盡之鑑賞，與詩文並重，無論君主士夫，莫不從事繒畫，以嗚風雅，蔚爲我繪畫史止之黃金時代。明淸以降，山水畫旣居主要地位，繪畫作風，雖稱流派紛紜，盛極一時，但究其實在，尙無多大變遞。惟自成同之後，外而國際，內而國事，局勢頓改，學術文化，劇　錄變，繪畫乃因之大變，或守古人法度，摹擬古人名作以求其工，或參用西法，主張融冶中西畫法於一爐，見仁見智，各守一說，實與百年以前之尙南貶北之情形不同。蓋繪畫爲反映社會，發揮思想，表達情感之文化產物，則百年以後之今日繪畫，自當有其時代精神之歷史價値，未可忽視。故欲研究我歷代繒畫，必從近百年開始，然後循此以往，逐步探討，正所謂行遠自邇，登高自卑之意。</p>
<p>歐美各國對於藝術文化，素極重視，雖窮鄕僻壞，皆有美術館之設立，以爲人民修養心身，陶冶性情之塲所。我國除故宮博物院外，對於美術館尙付闕如。上海爲國際都市，又居全國領導之地位，敎育局應社會人士及文化界美術界之要求，乃有美術館籌備處之成立，首先舉辦百年畫展，際此建國開始，文敎爲重，百年畫展之舉，俾市民有欣賞觀摩之機會，對於精神上之潛移默化，所得效果，正未可限量。是爲序。</p>
<h3>臨唐六如春山伴侶圖</h3>
<p>吳大澂，吳縣人，字子淸，號恒軒，又號　齋。精鑑別，　收藏，戊辰以進士入詞林，官至湖南巡撫。光緒甲申回籍，主講龍門書院。大激幼工筆書，中年參以古簎；兼長刻印繪事。山水花卉，用筆秀逸。是圖丘繫廻環，叢山雲擁，筆酣墨沉，氣格渾厚。上錄六如原題，書法圖潤，堪稱雙絕。（陳倚石識）</p>
<h3>近百年畫展之意義</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>我國繪畫，原與書法同源，后以繁簡不同，質文異致，一則趨於符號紀事而有定形，一則趨於自然模狀而無定態，至是而書畫分流焉。</p>
<p>自皇帝繪　尤象以弭亂，圖神荼以禦鬼之後，歷唐而處，會宗彝，畫衣冠，繪畫多依存於社會實用。自三代以迄秦漢，君權確立，禮敎形成，几百繪事，無不寓「成敎化，助人倫，」之政敎意義。漢末三國鼎分，政敎潰弛，思想漸趨自由，逮魏晋南北朝，猶復兵連禍結，士夫逃於淸談壓世，佛敎乘機流入，宗敎畫於焉勃興。唐，五代以還，佛敎與原有之儒家及道家文化，交相融合滲流，蔚成一種新文化，故其時畫藝製作，雖仍以佛畫爲中心，但已脫出六朝之原樣模寫窠臼，嶄然獨創，自具中土藝術之特立精神。惟自王維援詩入畫，蔚爲此後文人畫之濫觴。下歷宋，（遼，金）元，明，淸諸代，畫家與文學書法，金石，長結不解之　，逸筆澹墨，寫意傳神，繒畫與書法，又呈相得益彰之趨勢。</p>
<p>淸末六十年間，雅片戰爭之後，已不復能閉關自雄，外而甲午，庚子諸役，內而太平天國，戊戌維新諸變，國運日在風雨中，舊文化傳統，亦根搖本動。洎海禁大開，啓蒙運運抬頭，西方美術，漸入斯土，於是有新舊畫派對立之事。迨至民國，歷經被譽爲中國文藝復興之「五四」運動，以及展開民族復典運動之「七七」抗戰，中國由積弱而躋於五强之一，文化課題，亦由囫圇吞進西方文化，與接受祖先遺產，而進至東西文化古今之融合交流邁步入含英咀華，吐糟棄粕之新時代，繪畫藝術，與時代精神相應，燦然進入一新階段。綜如上述，自咸同至今，爲時約百年，國畫與西畫，始而水火冰炭，各不相能，分庭對抗，各自爲政，正與新舊文化對壘始當。繼而互相誘發，互相汲引，互相媒變，互相提高，直與新舊文化之融合再造無異。此百年中，中國繪畫，與其國家及其全文化，同受巨大考騐，同經烈火洗禮，而目前更同負承先啓後，繼往開來之光輝使命，殆無疑義。然今之論者，言畫輙盛稱晋唐，其後皆自噲已下，卑無足諭，殊不知一時代乃有一時代之藝術任務，正不能以彼例此。如所云然，則晋唐而後，畫家可以擱筆矣。故欲正確估計近百年畫之價値，是必先拋棄此種玩古董式之成見，從歷史出發，始可認識到此一時代之國　藝術，實已上紹先人偉業，下育新生胎胚，其受西洋藝術影響，正與漢唐之受印度佛畫藝術影響相同，後一時期之發展端倪，自可由此窺知。</p>
<p>美術館籌備處舉行畫展，先辦近百年畫展，此後當循流探源，絡續舉行淸初四王，以至於明，元，宋，唐，晋漢各代，分期探索，意在由近及遠，知今而鑒古，正視近百年繪畫之藝術及其歷史價値，其亦足矯正惟古是尊之古董觀念也乎？</p>
<p>上海市美術館籌備處主辦百年畫展，日昨已於南昌路　文協會開幕。祗以是項展覽，於我國近代書畫之　變，頗多參考價値。本刊前曾有所評介，今特再輯有關文字數篇，藉備讀者參證，（編者）</p>

<h3>四紅圖</h3>
<p>— 任渭長</p>
<p>任熙，蕭山人，字渭長，工花鳥山水，尤長人物。其澤古功深，故能脫盡凡俗，筆意遒勁，可　章侯之席。所作有「於越先賢」，「列仙」，「酒牌」，等畫傳，行世。是幀行筆沉毅，純用中鋒法，圖中四美，曲眉豐頰，迫近唐　，堪稱渭長經意之作。（陳倚石識）</p>
<h3>百年畫展集序</h3>
<p>— 顧毓琇</p>
<p>我國繪畫，源遠流長，始雛形於唐虞，具濫觴於三代；秦漢以還，益增絢爛。佛敎莊嚴，彩繪色相，功臣麟閣，丹靑傳神。晋唐人材輩出，六法大備，宋元諸家，意境神韵，俱臻上品。明淸迄今，精微奧妙，各極其致。中華民族之精神，得所寄託。近百年來，世風演變，文化交流，繪畫亦受其影響，上海市美術館籌備處，爰搜集百年來已故名家作品三百餘幀，舉行展覽，並選精品二十四幀，影印成集，以資觀摩，倘亦愛好藝術諸君子所樂許乎？是爲序。</p>

<h3>說孟小冬</h3>
<p>— 鼓王</p>
<p>杜月笙先生花甲壽辰，北平名伶，南來祝壽者甚多，其中最難得者，爲坤伶孟小冬。南中震其名者，亟欲知其藝術達若何程度。余最近旅平十年，聆孟劇共六次，以十年論，不應如此之少，然冬皇（平北捧孟者甚多，報中一律稱之爲冬皇），在平深居簡出，又時患小恙，此十年中，演出亦不滿十次，予所聆者，三次爲「捉放」，兩次爲「駡曹」，最後一次，則「搜孤救孤」也。後一齡，程　名種重作，甚難却到好處，本均爲余叔岩拿手戲，冬皇演來，種種唱腔，韵味醇厚，其峭勁處，尤得余神髓。聽者以叔岩久病，從不露演，買主得羊，亦當然過廳。是以多皇聲名亦逐年增重，非倖致也。</p>
<p>唱以嗓爲主要，非天賦獨優者，不能享大名，冬皇二十年前，在滬出演，老友馬二先生，（即馮叔鸞），盛加稱許，謂此女嗓音極佳，尤宜唱譚派，馮固絕不輕許人者。余當時曾聽過數次，如「空城計」「洪羊洞」等類，但覺其嗓音，勝於普通坤伶，而藝術亦未能逈不猶人，迨後聲　鵲起，曾與蘭芳同演探母，一生一旦，可謂極倒鳳顚鸞之致，繼而一雙兩好，居然伉　，余以爲此曲祇應天上有矣。不謂好景不長，旋賦仳離，而吾輩顧曲者，轉得暢飽耳福。亦殊非始願所及。</p>
<p>冬皇之嗓，寬亮而甜，尤善於遝用。光緒中葉，注孫譚三派鼎立，譚之嗓，實不如汪孫，然呌天修養獨到，能集前輩之大成，故韵味獨出冠時，與論乃翕然歸之，叔岩之能繼鑫培，亦以韵勝也。冬皇專心師余，在叔岩病中，有時常留余寓侍疾，余之繼室姚女士，恒吿人冬皇之小心伺候病人，勝於孝女之事生父，余病小愈，自必悉授心傳，冬皇之得有今日造就，其專心研求，亦實可佩。</p>
<p>余在平初聆「捉放」，大喜過望，以爲行腔使調，居然曲　譚余，士別三日，那得不刮目相看。今日劇壇男伶嗓音，鬚生以譚富英爲第一，黑頭以金少山爲第一，靑衣以張君秋爲第一，而欲求唱做並佳者，實難其人。孟小冬其庶幾乎？</p>
<p>冬皇嗓音，不能超過小譚，而韻味逈非富英所能及。某君吿我，小冬除親炙叔岩外，與鮑吉祥相從最久，鮑老胸中戲學至富，對於無論何戲，舉手授足，種種身段，無不研求至細，曾與老譚配戲，故對於呌天戲中所有動作，咸詳細爲冬皇述之，是以小冬一出臺，其態度從容大方，求之男伶中，亦無人能及。吾等謂速良之做工失之貧，實森失之瘟，當英之臺步，尤其隨便可笑，冬皇鶴立鷄羣，不可謂非出類拔萃矣。</p>
<h3>新聞剪輯</h3>
<p>— 小卒輯</p>
<p>瀋陽某大學在聘約委員會席上，某院長與校長因故發生爭執。某院長當時向校長說：「你懂得什麼？我在德國有兩個博士學位，你的學位在那兒？我在德國，七個學生有四十多個世界權威敎授，你聽見過嗎？我抗戰八年，有過一百二十多稱著作，你的成績在那裏？」舉座爲之愕然。</p>
<p>豐潤縣警察每日出動巡視街頭及各戶淸潔狀况，如發現不淸潔家庭，即罰該戶主婦戴尖紙帽遊街示衆，全縣主婦大起恐慌。</p>
<p>國立北京，淸華，南開三大學今夏聯合招生，歷史試題中　「周口店曾發現什麼？」一間，某生答稱：「曾發現張莘夫的屍體」；又，國文試　請解釋「胡兒」一語，某生答案爲「乃胡過校長幼年時其母呼彼之乳名」。</p>
<h3>陰陽怪氣的電話</h3>
<p>— 懷</p>
<p>裘軍醫在菲洲和意大利的軍營裏，過了三年以後、正要回家了。他的妻子瑪蕾聽到了這個興奮的消息，就準備計劃怎樣在她的丈夫靠岸後，打第一個電話來時說一點適當的話，這個電話一定應該是十全十美的。但是她越是思慮，越是慌亂得找不出什麼適當的話來了！</p>
<p>後來，她簡直毫無辦法，祗得去向她的表兄請敎。表兄是一個剛從海外國來的陸軍中尉，他對她笑笑，道：「什麼？這沒有什麼，電話來了，你就說：「喂，親愛的」！　將會說：「親愛的，孩子們好嗎」？然後你吿訴他孩子們很好。這樣，話匣不是打開了嗎？這，太便當了！</p>
<p>兩天以後的一個晚上，表的電話果眞來了。好久好久，方才聽到了他的聲音。</p>
<p>「喂，親愛的！」瑪蕾快樂地說。</p>
<p>「喂，親愛的！」軍醫高聲回道。</p>
<p>於是，他塞住了，她也塞住了，他們都說不出話來了。瑪蕾急得要命，慌亂之中記起了中尉的公式。她尖叫道：「孩子們好嗎？」</p>
<p>爸爸表離家三年了，因惑地唧　道：「嗄，好！好！」</p>

<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>値得介紹的「青鄉碧玉」</p>
<p>就憑愛德華魯濱遜，瑪格蘭奧白朗，賈克環金這三個演員主演的片子，已經是値得一看的了。至少比起那些五彩七彩的片子來要强得多。</p>
<p>這部「靑鄕碧玉」的故事跟「玉女神駒」差不多，是以一個美國小鄕村爲背景，細膩而生動的描寫了這一羣善良的村人，他們的工作，生活，與一些希望。從馬蒂尼這一家的生活中，帶出了整個鄕村的活動情形，那一對天眞可愛的孩子子——茜瑪與亞諸是串連全劇人物的一條主綫，作者透過了人情味的描寫，淡雅淸麗的完成了這部「靑鄕碧王」。如果我們不要求得苛刻，那末這部戲是値得介紹的。</p>
<p>顯然的，演員超過了導演的成績，愛德華魯濱遜的馬蒂尼，深深的刻劃了一個善良純樸的農民。瑪格蘭奧白朗的茜瑪，與賈克瓊金的亞諾，確是一對天材的小演員。她們那樣自然慰貼的表演了這二個人物的性格，尤其瑪格鬧奧白朗在看馬戲時的那一塲戲，有着超特收穫，使人爲她拍案叫絕。此外傑姆斯克萊格的海佛遜與茀蘭茜絲吉馥的薇拉，也演得相當優秀。</p>
<p>自然導演的成續，也是不該抹煞的。</p>
<p>胡鬧的「戰地鶯聲」</p>
<p>「戰地董聲」是珍妮麥唐娜興勞勃脫揚主演的一部舊片子。故事描寫一個新聞記者與一個歌星的戀愛史，中間穿插一段反納粹的間諜故事，如果你想從這間諜故事中去找尋合理，那簡直是幻恕了。一切在劇作者的描寫下是形同兒戲，那許多納粹間諜，不過是用來凑凑熱鬧的，爲了要完成這個鬧劇罷了，因此這個戲的格調甚低。</p>
<p>假使你想滿足珍妮麥唐娜的歌唱，那末這片子同樣使你失望。勞勃脫揚的表演亦未見精彩。</p>
<p>並不出色的「飛行金剛」</p>
<p>好萊塢的片子裏，最多描寫　一類「金剛」與「英雄」。所以在看多了的時候，實在覺得有點「膩」的。即使是退一步來講，那末運「飛行金剛」裏的男主角傑美葛倫，只是個浮燥的美國靑年，生活上風流自賞，亂　戀愛，作戰時，個人美雄主義，最後雖然是以報効了國家，但這樣的人物依然是該否定的。</p>
<p>演出上，勞納李根的傑美葛倫，毫無精彩表演，其他的演員，僅詹姆史梯文森尙見差强人意。</p>
<p>尙可一看的「金屋藏嬌」</p>
<p>本片導演成績，也極平席。這部片子描寫一個靑年在作戰歸來後，身心俱毀，因此他拒見家人與未婚妻，生活變得孤單寂寞而怪僻，後來與一個鄕女因朝夕相處，由戀愛而結婚，才重新又恢復了他的生活樂趣。這樣一個簡單的故事，着重在心裏上的刻劃，因此便稱作了「文藝片」其實並沒有什麼特色。但這片子在導演約翰克朗威兩的處理下，筑氛情調均甚佳，尤其那工塲海濱的戲是異常優美動人的。</p>
<p>女主角桃樂珊凄瑰的戲前半部較佳，後半部戲缺少光彩。男主角勞勃脫揚，相當的盡力，赫勃馬歇爾的有音樂家尙稱職。</p>
<p>「丘八乾爺」與「新俠盜查祿」</p>
<p>「丘八乾　一是亞卓，考斯坦羅的滑稽片，全片均爲胡鬧，以賽車的緊張鎮頭來刺激觀衆，其實也是老套子了。另一部「新俠盜查祿」，那是部小公司的劣等打武片，亂打一通，一無可取。</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the Legislative Yuan After Recess: Approval of Treaty with Italy, Civil Servant Loan Proposal Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its first meeting after the recess on the morning of the 15th. About 80 legislators attended. President Sun presided over the meeting. The legislators, having returned from constitutional study tours in various locations, joyfully recounted their experiences after a separation of two months. The important matters passed during the meeting included: (1) approval of the peace treaty with Italy, (2) approval of the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement, (3) the Organizational Regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Testing Laboratory, (4) amendment of Articles 26 and 27 of the Internal Organizational Law, (5) Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Military Personnel and their Families During Mobilization, and (6) amendment of the Organizational Law of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. In addition, there were also amendments to cases related to elections: (1) the allocation table of National Assembly representatives elected from various counties and cities and equivalent areas, (2) the division table of Legislative Yuan electoral districts in Jiangxi, (3) the division table of Legislative Yuan electoral districts in Anhui, (4) the allocation table of Legislative Yuan representatives from various provinces and cities not divided into districts, and (5) Article 9 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law and the amendment of Article 9 of the Implementing Regulations for the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The first major event after the Legislative Yuan's resumption was the approval of the 1947 Peace Treaty with Italy. This treaty was signed in Paris on February 10th this year, with 20 Allied nations, including China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, participating in the signing ceremony. The treaty is divided into eleven parts and ninety articles, with seventeen annexes. The eleven main points are as follows: (1) territorial aspects, (2) political clauses, (3) war criminals, (4) naval, land, and air force clauses, (5) withdrawal of Allied troops, (6) demands arising from the war, (7) property, rights, and obligations, (8) general economic relations, (9) dispute resolution, (10) various economic clauses, (11) final clauses. Chapter 5 of the second part, political clauses, concerns China's special interests and contains three articles. Article 24 stipulates that Italy relinquishes to China "all benefits and privileges arising from the Final Protocol signed in Beijing on September 7, 1901, and all exchanges of notes and documents supplementing it," and agrees to the abolition of the exchanges of notes and documents annexed to that protocol concerning Italy. At the same time, Italy also waives any claims for compensation arising therefrom. Article 25 stipulates that Italy agrees to cancel the lease granted by the Chinese government for the Italian concession in Tianjin and agrees to transfer all properties and archives of the municipal government of the concession to the Chinese government. Article 26 stipulates that Italy relinquishes all its rights in the public concessions in Shanghai and Xiamen to China and agrees that the public concessions in these two places shall be governed by the Chinese government. After this case was brought up at the 333rd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th, Dai Xiujun, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, first reported on the review process, followed by a speech by legislator Sun Jiulu, who solemnly pointed out that the term "special interests of China" in the treaty was not accurate at all, because China had not obtained any special interests in the treaty, and hoped that the meeting could include this point in the record. The case was passed without objection after a brief discussion. Another important diplomatic case at the meeting was the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement. This agreement was formally signed as early as July 23rd, and the Foreign Affairs and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan had also reviewed and passed it. After it was presented at today's meeting, it was unanimously approved without objection (for the full text, see this newspaper on July 24th). In addition, a case related to diplomacy involved actively and swiftly negotiating with Portugal to recover Macau. After this case was passed by the 328th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, it was reported to the National Government. After the National Government instructed the Executive Yuan to submit a response, which was then reviewed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, negotiations for recovery will be proposed again when the time is ripe. When Secretary-General Lou reported on this case in the Yuan, Legislator Gu and others expressed satisfaction.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] A proposal by legislators Liu Zhiping, Chen Guyuan, and 50 others, "requesting the Executive Yuan to provide living loans for civil servants to alleviate their urgent needs and improve work efficiency," was brought up at today's meeting. The legislators spoke enthusiastically, all agreeing that the hardship of public educators' lives was unimaginable, and that the government should provide assistance to these essential personnel struggling on the poverty line. The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, first stood up to explain that at this time and place, everyone should share the hardships and practice thrift, but the word "thrift" should not be applied only to civil servants whose lives are already extremely difficult. Liu pointed out that some high-ranking officials live in tall buildings, travel in cars, and are attended by servants, all paid for by the state, which is unfair compared to public educators who are struggling in poverty. He hoped that relief could be planned even in extremely difficult circumstances. Jian Guanzan pointed out: (1) The manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can receive 15 million per month in addition to the cars and foreign houses provided by the government, which is 10 million more than the president of the Legislative Yuan. Suffering is not to be feared, but fairness must be sought. Excessive disparity is enough to affect administrative efficiency. Huang Youchang reminded the legislators that the problem of medical care also urgently needs to be solved. Among his friends, many have died after suffering from illnesses due to high living pressures and being unable to afford treatment. This fact cannot be ignored. Deng Hongye cited the story of Vice President Tan's death, where he was destitute and could not afford a burial, making a painful appeal. Being a civil servant today means you cannot afford to live, cannot afford to be sick, cannot afford to live, and cannot afford to die. The state of affairs is truly heartbreaking. Chen Guyuan, Chen Haicheng, and others all proposed solutions. Finally, because this case requires detailed study, it was decided to first submit it to the Finance and Economic Committees for review.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Election Announcement: Legislators Deem it Open Defamation, Resolution to Submit to Next Legislative Yuan General Meeting for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, dissatisfied with the allocation of seats for professional representatives, published advertisements in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, attacking the Legislative Yuan. At the first meeting of the Legislative Yuan after the recess on the morning of the 15th, the legislators expressed indignation at the Chamber of Commerce's open insult to government agencies. This case was brought up by legislator Chen Guyuan. He asked whether the nation still had laws and regulations if the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce could openly defame government agencies in newspaper advertisements. Zhou Yizhi read the original text of the advertisement in public, believing that the wording was absurd and insulted the entire Legislative Yuan, and that there must be a response. Chen Haimei pointed out that it was incomprehensible that the competent authorities had turned a blind eye to this kind of action and had not corrected it. Liu Butong believed that this matter was only the action of a few people, and that the Chambers of Commerce in Tianjin and other places were unaware of this, and advocated suggesting to the National Government to dissolve the Chamber of Commerce. Wei Tingsheng, Deng Hongye, and others believed that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce did not hold a meeting before publishing this advertisement, so a few people should bear legal responsibility for this matter, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, which is in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, should investigate thoroughly. The Ministry of Social Affairs also cannot be excused for failing to stop it. Finally, because this matter involves criminal law and commercial law issues, it was decided to first submit it to the Criminal Law and Commercial Law Committees for research, and then submit it to the next general meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>To Purify the Election Atmosphere: An Inspection Team Should be Organized</h3>
<p>Legislator Hong Ruizhao Discusses General Elections</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] This morning, a reporter visited legislator Hong Ruizhao to inquire about his views on the upcoming general elections. Hong was one of the drafters of the ten major constitutional laws and has recently returned to Nanjing from his native Zhejiang. According to him, this year's general election is the first in Chinese history. As a former journalist, he returned to Zhejiang to listen to public opinion through news gathering and participate in the election with a modern democratic approach. He gave public speeches in various counties in eastern Zhejiang, attended more than twenty symposiums, and exchanged views on election issues with leaders from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, cultural, and other sectors. His preliminary observations are as follows: (1) The election atmosphere in various places is far from satisfactory, and phenomena such as coercion, bribery, and lavish banquets are still widespread, especially the favoritism and dereliction of duty of the responsible agencies. These phenomena often cannot be corrected by ordinary laws. He believes that to prevent election fraud, special regulations must be enacted and promulgated. At the same time, he is suggesting to the central government that supervisory committee members, legislators, senators, and members of various parties who do not participate in the election should be selected to form a roving inspection team to quickly go to various provinces and cities to conduct strict supervision to purify the election atmosphere. (2) He is a member of the Kuomintang. The guidance on party member election methods issued by the central government is a necessary measure for the party. This shows the wisdom of the authorities' decision-making. Today, the central authorities are generally able to be impartial and patriotic in handling elections, and are carefully planning. However, his impressions in eastern Zhejiang are that the central government's intentions may not be fully implemented at the lower levels, and that facts of Kuomintang members violating orders and using their powers have been seen repeatedly. Thinking of this, he is deeply worried. In order to maintain the discipline of the Kuomintang, in addition to the various regulations currently issued, it seems that further strict measures should be taken to ensure the execution of the central government's laws, otherwise the future of the election will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>British Minister of Civil Aviation, Nathan, to Arrive in Beijing the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] The British Embassy announced that Lord Nathan, the British Minister of Civil Aviation, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing by plane from Hong Kong on September 18th. He will discuss civil aviation matters between the two countries with the Ministry of Communications. Lord Nathan is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government and is scheduled to depart for Tokyo on September 21st.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Dickson, the chairman of the British United Aid to China Fund, will soon travel to China, India, and other parts of the Far East. Dickson lived in central China for many years with the Wesleysan mission.</p>
<h3>Aikman Flies to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] MacArthur's resource consultant, Aikman, came to Beiping to investigate the resource reserves in northern China. Now that the work is completed, he flew to Beijing by plane on the morning of the 15th.</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Luo Jialun Reports on the Indian Issue</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held the Premier's Memorial Week on the morning of the 15th. After President Chiang led the ceremony, Luo Jialun, the ambassador to India, reported on the Indian issue.</p>
<h3>Madam Chiang Concerned About the Disaster Situation in the Northeast: Convenes a Relief Meeting, Elects Standing Directors and Supervisors, Decides to First Raise 1 Billion in Circulation Certificates to Handle Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Northeast has suffered from the oppression and destruction of the enemy puppets for the past fourteen years, and has been repeatedly disturbed by communist bandits after the war. The local area is dilapidated, and the people's livelihood is miserable. This summer's rains have caused disasters, resulting in the successive flooding of the Liao River, Taizi River, Hun River, Qiaoliu River, Chai River, and Dongsha River basins. Crops have been submerged, and houses have collapsed. More than 2,724,000 acres of farmland in the eight counties and cities of Liaoyang, Haicheng, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Tieling, Panshan, Tai'an, and Yingkou have been flooded, affecting more than 500,800 people. The total loss of livestock, real estate, and assets is estimated at 287.5 billion national currency. Madam Chiang Kai-shek has always been concerned about the Northeast, and she personally went to comfort and appease the people after the restoration, earning their gratitude and praise. Recently, in view of the severe disaster situation in the Northeast, she convened a tea party with the directors and supervisors of the Northeast Relief Association and relevant people from all walks of life at her official residence at 5 p.m. on the 15th to discuss raising large sums of money to handle emergency relief in the Northeast. Those attending included Mo Dehui, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Yu Bin, Liu Zhe, Zhou Zhirou, Dong Xianguang, Wang Depu, Zou Zuohua, Huo Baoshu, Liu Butong, etc. President Chiang Soong Mei-ling reported on the significance of the meeting. Regarding the organization, in addition to President Chiang Soong Mei-ling and Vice President Mo Dehui remaining in their positions, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Du Tang, Qian Yongming, Zhou Zhirou, Yu Bin, and Ding Guitang were elected as standing directors. Wang Depu was elected as the director-general, and Chen Guofu, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Feipeng, Zhang Jia'ao, Liu Zhe, Wu Guozhen, Wang Xiaolai, Huo Baoshu, Xu Jiqing, Li Fusun, Pan Gongzhan, Zou Zuohua, Shu Yunzhang, Xu Xueyu, Qin Runqing, Fang Zhi, Wu Yunchu, Fu Rulin, Zhang Aizhen, Lu Guangmian, and Liu Butong were elected as directors. It was resolved that (1) 1 billion in circulation certificates would be raised first for emergency relief; (2) the Executive Yuan would be requested to allocate 2 billion yuan and 1,000 tons of food, and allocate a large amount of winter clothing to handle emergency relief as soon as possible; (3) Mo Dehui and Xu Kan would be sent to Shanghai to negotiate with all parties to raise relief funds.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Member Yu Shude and 12 Others Jointly Write to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Proposing Seven Opinions on the Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>

<p>3.  Regarding the issue of Japanese territory, we should firmly advocate delineating the scope of its mainland in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement.

<p>4.  Regarding the issue of restricting Japanese military equipment, we should firmly advocate thoroughly disarming Japan, prohibiting the reconstruction of naval, land, and air forces, and eliminating its combat potential to prevent the possibility of military aggression again.</p>
<p>5.  Regarding the issue of restricting Japan's industrial level, we should firmly advocate thoroughly dismantling the tools of Japan's economic aggression, just as we disarm it, so that it cannot engage in economic aggression again.</p>
<p>6.  Regarding the issue of restricting Japanese trade, we should advocate strictly managing and restricting Japan's exports and imports.</p>
<p>7.  Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, we should advocate taking the Japanese reparations plan drafted by Pauley as the minimum requirement.</p>
<h3>Commission in Charge of Supervising the Transport of Japanese Reparations Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The "Commission for Supervising the Transport of Japanese Reparations and Restitution Goods," affiliated with the Executive Yuan's Reparations Commission, has been established.

Its first ship carrying reparations goods will sail from the Philippines to Japan this month. We must decide as soon as possible what our country's attitude towards this batch of reparations goods is and what the transportation method should be to avoid causing intangible losses to the country due to further delays."</p>
<h3>Lottery Distribution of Japanese Warships: Our Country Obtains Ten Ships, to be Delivered to Our Country by the End of This Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Our country drew the only destroyer in this distribution during the fourth lottery, distributing 39 former Japanese warships. China, the United States, and the Soviet Union each obtained ten ships this time, while the United Kingdom obtained only nine ships. The ten ships obtained by our country (including the destroyer) will sail to Shanghai or Qingdao on the 26th and 28th of this month. These ships are expected to be delivered to our country in Shanghai or Qingdao by the end of this year. It is reported that some of the ten ships obtained by the United States will sail to Qingdao for shooting exercises.

<h3>Chen Cheng Receives Educational Circles, Encourages Them to Build the Northeast Psychologically</h3>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office, 15th] Chen Cheng received educational circles in the Northeast at 3 p.m. on the 15th. The education authorities of various provinces and cities, the presidents of various universities, and related personnel attended, totaling more than 300 people. They unanimously requested that measures be taken to improve security, living conditions, and equipment in order to save the crisis in education in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jiyang Office, 15th] Chen Cheng said in his speech at the reception for educational circles that the Northeast issue is not a regional issue but a national issue. Everyone must recognize the Northeast and build the Northeast, and must recognize that the Northeast is the safest and most reliable place. We must build the Northeast psychologically and not abandon the Northeast psychologically. The Northeast is a powder keg and a volcano. We must protect it and build it to prevent it from exploding. This is not only beneficial to China but also benefits the international community and even all mankind. There may have been concerns about the military situation in the Northeast in August and September, but now I can clearly state that there are absolutely no problems with the military situation in the Northeast. Please rest assured that I will definitely seek progress in military, political, and educational construction.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Vigorously Reviews its China Policy: Secretary Marshall Invites Foreign Minister Wang to Meet, Contents of Two-Hour Private Talk Kept Secret</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall invited our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to dinner on the night of the 14th and held talks for two hours. It is reported that Secretary Marshall dined alone with Foreign Minister Wang, but the nature of the talks remains a diplomatic secret.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] U.S. Ambassador Dr. Stuart Leighton said on the 15th that the negotiations between the Chinese and American governments on continuing work after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are being conducted in Nanjing by both sides and an agreement will be reached in the near future. The ambassador declined to comment on the government's statement on the 14th regarding the Wedemeyer Mission, but said that the Americans are willing to see China's peace, unity, democracy, strength and vigor, and the Americans also very much want to do their best to assist China, and this principle will never change. The ambassador finally said, "He is paying the greatest attention to the recent reforms of the government," and said, "This reform is a progress in the right direction."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Although President Chiang made a new appeal to the United States for aid in his war against the Communists, the United States has not yet decided on the issue of providing further aid to China. President Chiang issued a warning on the 14th through the embassy in the United States that the success or failure of his war against the Communists would not only determine the future of China, but also affect the security of the entire Far East. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that President Chiang's appeal was a timely motion because the U.S. policy toward China is currently under vigorous review, but they stressed that the future course of the China policy has not been decided before Wedemeyer returns to the United States in the middle of this week. It is expected that Wedemeyer will submit his recommendations to the President after President Truman returns from South America this weekend. It is also learned that China has now submitted various plans to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, totaling more than 300 million U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>I Prevent Currency Inflation: Domestic Floating Capital Must Be Frozen: Views Expressed by Foreign Observers</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] Foreign neutral observers state: China's currency inflation, with prices starting to soar again, the only effective way for the government to eradicate it is to freeze domestic floating capital, so as to prevent it from causing trouble from time to time and disrupting people's livelihoods. Although the rice-producing areas have abundant harvests, the price of rice in this city has risen by nearly 50% in recent days. The exchange rate, which was stable in August, has now followed suit. The main reason for this unnecessary rise in rice prices is speculative hoarding. As legitimate commerce is restricted by regulations and cannot develop, hoarding has become an outlet for floating capital. Hoarding accelerates the rise in prices. Japanese floating capital is now also ordered to be frozen by MacArthur. If China wants to practice thrift,</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Financial authorities here state: The Chinese government now intends to have Chinese people repatriate foreign currencies held abroad, estimated to total between 300 million and 1 billion US dollars, but it is feared that the effect will be minimal. This measure has been approved by the National Economic Commission and is now awaiting official promulgation. Most financial observers here believe that this law cannot be implemented under the current circumstances. Some commentators say that the government's motive for proposing this is political capital rather than financial capital. Chinese officials have now openly criticized British and American banks for refusing to provide the names of Chinese depositors, believing that this will inevitably lead to the failure of this plan.</p>

<h3>Large Amounts of Northeast Capital Enter the Interior; Authorities Pay Attention and Will Investigate Thoroughly</h3>

<h3>Elimination of Price Differences in Trade Between the Interior and Exterior is Decided; Barter Method is Adopted; Exchange of Materials Between the Northeast and Taiwan Province is Still Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The method of paying price differences for goods purchased from the interior by the Northeast will soon be abolished, and a barter method will be adopted in the future. The method of paying price differences for Northeast metal exports was formulated at the beginning of trade between the Northeast and the interior, when the price difference between the Northeast and the interior was extremely large. Northeast metals could obtain a large profit after being transported to the interior. The price difference was taken from the merchants' profits. However, since the fall, prices in the Northeast have fluctuated greatly, and at present, there is a trend of exceeding prices in the interior. Merchants do not make much profit from transporting goods to the interior. If they pay the price difference again, they will not only not make a profit, but may also lose money. The continued existence of this method will hinder trade between the interior and the exterior. Therefore, after consultation, the relevant authorities decided to abolish the method of paying price differences for purchased goods and adopt a barter method. In the future, importing merchants must transport materials designated by the Economic Commission from the interior in order to exchange for export permits for Northeast metals. Export merchants must also exchange materials for materials from the interior before they are allowed to export. However, the value of the barter must be equal. As for the types of goods to be bartered, the interior goods are daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, flour, and white sugar, and the exterior goods are metal materials such as pig iron, angle iron, and bamboo steel.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The exchange of materials between the Northeast and Taiwan is still difficult to achieve in practice. Pan Chesheng, a design committee member of the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee, who was previously sent to Taiwan Province by the committee, has recently returned to Shenyang from Taiwan. According to his report, after many contacts, the exchange of materials between the Northeast and Taiwan is difficult to achieve in the short term. This is because all sleepers in Taiwan Province are directly controlled by the Ministry of Communications. When other provinces need them, they must first apply to the Ministry of Communications for approval before they can be transported out. As for sugar, because the current stock in Taiwan Province is not very large, it is planned to be exported to earn foreign exchange, so it cannot be transported to the Northeast in the short term. As for Northeast metals, the only thing currently needed in Taiwan Province is the thinnest iron plate. The price of transporting this type of iron plate from the Northeast is not very suitable. Although fertilizer is needed in large quantities in Taiwan Province, the quantity of fertilizer powder transported by UNRRA is already not small, and its price is cheaper and its effectiveness is better. As for Northeast soybean cake products, it is still necessary to seek sales in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Economic Commission Convenes Symposium to Discuss Increased Production of Agricultural Products for Export</h3>

<h3>Details of the Impeachment Case Against Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau: Misconduct in the Distribution of Cars to the New Sui Company</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The case of the impeachment of Jiang Biao, Director of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, and others for dereliction of duty by Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang, Mei Gongren, Zhang Lu, and Ji Zhenfu has been established after review and has been transferred for disciplinary action. The details of the case are as follows: In November of last year, the Materials Supply Bureau entered into a contract with the New Sui Company, stating that the Supply Bureau would distribute 200 cars to the New Sui Company for sale in the Northwest region. Subsequently, the Jianguo Industrial Company also applied to the Supply Bureau for the distribution of 22 cars, but the bureau did not distribute them due to a lack of cars. However, Wang Yingbin, Chief Secretary of the bureau, promised to allocate a considerable number of cars to the New Sui Company's allocation, and Liu Zhitang, Manager of the New Sui Company, went to the bureau to complete the formalities and obtain a car purchase certificate. Later, when the vehicles arrived at the Shanghai Customs, the Jianguo Company went to pick them up, but the bureau declared the contract invalid due to the New Sui Company's breach of contract, converted the vehicles for sale in Shanghai, and stopped the sale. As a result, the Jianguo Company was unable to obtain the vehicles that it should have been allocated based on the certificate, and the Materials Bureau also considered the original contract invalid. Later, the bureau entered into another contract with the New Sui Company to distribute 100 cars. The New Sui Company then received 14 cars from the vehicles of the first contract that the bureau had declared invalid. Among them, only one had a certificate issued by a certain Northwest church, while the other 13 were received based only on certificates from local merchants. The Jianguo Company then filed a complaint. After the case was filed, it was established after review by Supervisory Committee members Mei Gongren and others. The reasons are approximately as follows: (1) The New Sui Company should be punished or the contract should be terminated for selling the vehicles that should have been sold in the Northwest in Shanghai in violation of the contract. (2) Only one of the 14 cars that the New Sui Company has already received has a valid certificate. (3) According to the first contract, all 200 cars should have been given to the New Sui Company for sale in the Northwest, but the bureau later allocated a portion of them to the Jianguo Company. Jiang Biao, Director of the bureau, Wang Yingbin, Chief Secretary, and the Director of the Distribution Office should all bear responsibility for the above points.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Recommends Revising Regulations on Punishing Corruption</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Supervisory Committee members Liu Shidu, Miao Peicheng, Wang Guanwu, Yang Zongpei, and others recently suggested to the National Government to revise the Criminal Law and the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The main points of the suggestion are as follows: (1) If a public official does not accept a bribe, the briber is guilty of a crime, but the public official is not guilty of a crime. (2) If a person is solicited for a bribe but does not give it, the person solicited is not guilty of a crime, but the public official is guilty of a crime. (3) Regardless of whether a bribe is offered or solicited and accepted, the person who offers the bribe is not guilty of a crime, but the person who accepts the bribe is guilty of a crime.</p>

<h3>Holding of the National Foreign Trade Conference</h3>
<p>The National Foreign Trade Conference, initiated by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, held its opening ceremony yesterday in Shanghai and will enter the discussion phase today. The convening of this National Foreign Trade Conference, with the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the business community as the main body, brings together national industrial and commercial tycoons and economists to jointly review the overall plan for foreign trade in the future, which is truly a major event in the current development of foreign trade.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, and the government's implementation of trade control policies, the entire foreign trade activity in our country has experienced a bloated and paralyzed phenomenon, unable to return to normal. Taking imports as an example, the Export-Import Management Committee controlled imported goods and foreign exchange, and only foreign merchants and a few commercial firms had the convenience of foreign exchange settlement, while imported goods were biased towards luxury goods and unnecessary materials. Taking exports as an example, the government lacked policies to encourage exports, and exporters struggled without a way out under various restrictions such as unstable currency system, high interest rates, rising raw material prices, and inconvenient transportation, sharing the unfortunate fate with the entire industrial production. Due to the deviation of import and export activities and the deformed control methods, import surpluses have been increasing month by month. On the one hand, the domestic market is occupied by foreign luxury goods, and limited foreign exchange is consumed invisibly; on the other hand, the market for export goods is becoming increasingly narrow, and even the Nanyang market has been unable to gain a foothold. As a result, export goods have no way to go, and exporters have no way to go. The only ones who benefit are certain special trading companies or enterprise companies, who take advantage of foreign exchange fluctuations, get the news first, and make huge profits by hoarding export goods, which does not help the national economy or people's livelihood. This is the crisis of foreign trade in our country, and the major crisis of the overall economy.</p>
<p>The government has accurately grasped this point and is striving to save the current crisis. Therefore, the "Economic Reform Plan" particularly emphasizes that "the government should encourage exports with effective methods to gradually balance foreign trade." It also stipulates that import goods should adopt import restriction policies, "except for production tools, raw materials, and books and instruments, efforts should be made to strictly restrict them to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures." At the same time, a chain system and export promotion policies are adopted for import and export trade, stipulating that "export businesses should be actively encouraged, and the government may purchase materials to facilitate exports, or designate certain items to be operated in a chain import and export manner to ensure increased exports to offset imports" to save the import surplus. These two principles, of course, cannot include all foreign trade policies. If there is a real decision and a real way to implement them, the deformed control can be transformed into reasonable control, and imports and exports can be balanced, so as not to repeat the phenomenon of being bloated on one side and paralyzed on the other. Now, the government is relaxing the scale of foreign exchange control and is planning to implement export promotion policies, which is a reform of trade policies in line with economic reforms. But this decision is not enough, and the promotion is not enough, and great and far-reaching efforts are still needed.</p>
<p>The National Foreign Trade Conference is being held in Shanghai at this time, which has great significance. We hope that this trade conference can integrate theory and practice, formulate constructive plans, and advise the government. First, the implementation of import control must restrict the import of luxury goods and unnecessary materials. Second, the implementation of export incentives must establish export promotion reform policies and coordinate the use of import and export chain methods. Third, foreign exchange management must ensure that there is no waste, and the import of production tools and cultural and educational supplies must be rationally open to foreign exchange. In addition, the soundness of industry organizations, the relationship between international trade and overseas Chinese trade, and the necessity of establishing national foreign trade mechanisms are all important issues related to the development of foreign trade. The National Foreign Trade Conference brings together industrial and commercial tycoons and economists, and there is no shortage of experienced and knowledgeable people. It is hoped that the achievements of this conference will be contributed to the government for adoption and implementation, which will help the government establish foreign trade policies and develop foreign trade activities in our country.</p>

<h3>Formal Exchange of Ratifications - Five-Nation Peace Treaty Takes Effect Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The exchange of ratifications of the peace treaty with Italy was held today in Paris by the four powers of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The treaty took effect at midnight standard time. The exchange of ratifications of the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary was held today in Moscow by the four powers. It was stipulated that 5:00 p.m. standard time was the effective time of the treaty. The exchange of ratifications of the peace treaty with Finland was also held in Moscow, with only Britain and the Soviet Union participating, because Finland had only declared war on the aforementioned two powers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th] Diplomatic representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and representatives from the French government, stored the originals of the ratified Italian peace treaty in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th. The ratified treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were stored in the Soviet government. After the Italian peace treaty formally took effect on the 15th, Italy completed its long-term efforts to replace Fascist politics with democratic politics, just as Churchill said, "Italy has completed its mission of returning home."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The peace treaties with the five countries of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland took effect today, and some time limits also started today. Within these time limits, the troops of the former enemy countries must be reduced, reparations must be paid, the ownership of the colonies should be resolved, the allied troops must be withdrawn, and the ownership of some lands must be determined.</p>
<p>Free Port Officially Born</p>
<p>The most important thing is the Free Territory of Trieste, which was born with the entry into force of the Italian peace treaty. Since the candidate for the governor of the Free Territory has not yet been decided by the Security Council, according to Annex VII of the Italian peace treaty, its temporary regime will continue to be managed by the Allied military government. The Allied troops under the jurisdiction of the military government, that is, the troops stationed in the Free Territory by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and South, are limited to 5,000 each, and Italy's sovereignty in the Trieste port area will be suspended immediately. The deadline for the withdrawal of Allied troops also starts today. The British and American troops in Italy and the Soviet troops in Bulgaria should be completely withdrawn within 90 days from September 15th. The Soviet Union may maintain some troops in Hungary and Romania to protect its transportation line to Austria.</p>
<p>Italian Colonies Resolved Within a Year</p>
<p>The disposal of Italian colonies will also be finally decided by the four powers of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France within one year from today. A special meeting of the four-power representatives will be held in London soon to discuss preparations for the final decision on the Italian colonies by the higher authorities of the four powers. The land, sea, and air forces of the former enemy countries should be reduced to the number stipulated in the peace treaty within six months from today, but the time limit for the reduction of the Italian navy is nine months. The surplus war equipment of the former enemy countries should be handed over to the Allies or destroyed within one month from today. Italy will also return the antiquities, documents, and all items of historical value taken from Abyssinia to Abyssinia within eighteen months from today.</p>
<p>Allied Countries Monitor the Implementation of the Treaty</p>
<p>Although the peace treaty does not explicitly stipulate when the Allied Management Committee in Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and the British-Soviet joint military delegation in Finland should end, Britain believes that these institutions should end immediately from the date the peace treaty with each country takes effect. Each peace treaty stipulates that the implementation of the peace treaty and the resolution of disputes arising from the peace treaty should first be handled by the ambassadors of the powers stationed in each country. Therefore, in Rome, they are the ambassadors of the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, in the Balkan countries, they are the political representatives of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and in Finland, they are the ministers of Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Four Powers Divide the Remaining Italian Ships</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 14th] The four-power naval committee arrived in Rome today, and the work of distributing the surplus Italian warships has begun. The committee was formally established after the Soviet Union ratified the peace treaty with Italy. According to the supplementary agreement signed by Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, after the Soviet Union obtains the warships allocated from Italy, it should return the warships borrowed by Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union during the war to Britain and the United States. The warships that Britain and the United States lent to the Soviet Union include: one battleship borrowed from Britain, seven destroyers, and three submarines. The United States lent one cruiser. It is reported that the Italian government has requested some of the four powers to abandon some of the Italian ships that can be obtained according to the Italian peace treaty. Marshall has stated that the United States can at least give up a part of the Italian ships under its name, and he expects Britain to take the same action. At the same time, Italy is indignant at the division of the Italian fleet.</p>
<p>The Amount of Compensation Owed by the Five Countries</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] The peace treaty stipulates that the five Axis powers should pay a total of 1.33 billion US dollars in compensation. Italy should pay 360 million US dollars in compensation and cede about 3,000 square miles of African territory. Although Bulgaria did not lose territory, it should pay 70 million US dollars in compensation. Finland paid 300 million US dollars in compensation to the Soviet Union, cut off the Pete Province, and leased the Bakala Island to the Soviet Union as a naval base for a term of 50 years.

<h3>Unblocking Rice Sources, Establishing a Fuel Team: Decisions Made at the Ninth Economic Inspection Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The ninth economic inspection meeting of this city was held at the city government, chaired by Mayor Wu.

<h3>Edible Oil Directly Distributed to Oil Shops: Avoiding Price Hikes Through Multiple Transfers; Social Affairs Bureau Suggests to China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, met with Mayor Wu yesterday to discuss the issue of edible oil supply in this city and suggested to the China Trust Bureau that it reconsider the current oil distribution method. According to Mr. Wu's conversation with reporters: When the Joint Edible Oil Distribution Office existed, the China Trust Bureau's oil allocation was directly distributed to the oil shops for sale to citizens. Based on the actual sales volume of each oil shop and an investigation of its business situation, the allocation was limited. Oil shops could not hoard it. This prevented oil speculators and trafficking merchants from profiting, but it benefited the citizens. Since the abolition of the Joint Distribution Office, the China Trust Bureau's oil allocation has been changed to direct distribution to oil factories. The oil factories then sell this allocated oil on the market, allowing for free buying and selling, which has pushed oil prices higher and higher. Oil shops must purchase edible oil from the market for sale. This involves multiple transactions, plus commissions, market expenses, and oil factory profits. As a result, the price of oil sold to citizens has increased significantly, and the only beneficiaries are oil merchants. Therefore, it is suggested that the China Trust Bureau restore the past method of direct allocation to oil shops. Otherwise, if the current oil distribution method continues, Mr. Wu believes that oil prices will not fall.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Has a Rare Large Diamond: Value Estimated at US$1.5 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources close to the banking community: A rare, world-class diamond is currently stored in a safe deposit box of a bank in this city. This diamond belongs to an overseas Chinese from Singapore, who inadvertently purchased it at a low price from a miner during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the fall of Singapore, he was detained by the Japanese invaders for two years. This diamond was hidden under the roots of an ancient tree beforehand, and thus was able to survive intact. After the victory, it was re-excavated, and its brilliance was the same as before. He took this diamond to Taiwan, where a certain authoritative professor at National Taiwan University confirmed that it was a type of diamond. When he passed through Hong Kong, he sawed off a small piece of the protruding part of the diamond, weighing about one hundred carats, and sold it for HK$40,000. Experts estimate that the diamond weighs about 680 carats in the rough. With some polishing, the net weight could be more than 400 carats. This is about five times heavier than the 87.5-carat diamond discovered in Arabia in June of this year, and is comparable to the largest diamond in the British Crown, the "Second Star of Africa" (309 and 1/4 carats). It is truly a rare treasure. It is said that the owner of the diamond is currently in Taiwan and hopes to sell it for US$1.5 million.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Tang Diangui, the general affairs section chief of the Zhejiang Cultivation Company, claimed on May 27 of this year that he was acting under the orders of Xu Pan, the manager of the company, to purchase 60 barrels of diesel (totaling 10 tons) from Zhuang Yihua of the Hualin Diesel Company for use by the company's Yuhui ship. Tang issued a 15 million yuan check in the name of the company. Zhuang delivered 43 barrels of diesel in advance. When the check came due, it could not be cashed. When Zhuang negotiated with Xu, Xu claimed that Tang had stolen the company seal. Zhuang then filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing the Zhejiang Cultivation Company of fraud. At yesterday's hearing, Zhuang and Tang did not appear, only Xu appeared in court. Xu claimed that Tang had embezzled a large amount of company funds, which could not be recovered, and had secretly returned to Ningbo, falsely claiming suicide on the Jiangya ship and leaving behind a suicide note. The company's accounts did not contain any records of this diesel, indicating that it was Tang's personal fraudulent behavior. The court then ordered the plaintiff's attorney to ensure that Zhuang appeared in court in person to testify at the next hearing, and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ship "Erich Hoepner" Reportedly En Route to Shanghai Again; We Are Determined to Detain Her If She Arrives</h3>
<p>The Soviet merchant ship "Erich Hoepner" violated our government's orders earlier this month by sailing directly to Dalian and bringing passengers to Shanghai, which prompted a protest from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a ban on the ship from coming to China again. The case was considered closed at that point.

<h3>American Soldier Embezzlement of Gold Coins Case: Huang Zaiyi Voluntarily Surrenders and Testifies in the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the restoration of Taiwan, before the National Army moved in, our government entrusted the American military to handle all matters of disarmament and reception. Colonel Evans, an American military officer, took the opportunity to embezzle four large boxes of Tai Ning Fu character gold coins and entrusted Huang Zaiyi to transport them to Shanghai for sale. After being reported, Evans returned to the United States, while Huang was investigated by the local court. However, he was later exempted from prosecution under the amnesty law.

I am extremely apprehensive. Had I known this earlier, I would not have caused you both to suffer for me. My elder brother informed me that the court had given you until August 21 to produce me. I immediately met with Colonel Weser, who came here from Shanghai, to negotiate my surrender. I have now gone to the United States to testify and the trial is scheduled for September 11." After receiving the letter, Cheng filed a statement with the court and submitted Huang's original English letter as evidence.</p>
<h3>Fabric Shop Employee Dismissed, Impersonates Shop to Defraud Russian Merchant</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Financial Deficit; Central Government "Does Not Intend to Subsidize"; Municipal Government Receives Reply from Executive Yuan</h3>

<h3>Group Assistance to Education Breaks Records; Seven Virtuous Individuals Contribute 100 Million; Impoverished Students Benefit Greatly</h3>
<p>At a preparation meeting for the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" a month ago, Mr. Shi Yonggeng, the vice chairman of this newspaper, stated that he would personally be responsible for raising 50 million yuan for the "Reader's Scholarship Fund" as a clarion call for the scholarship movement to attract the attention of society and achieve the goal of "accumulating many small efforts to make a great achievement."</p>
<p>A month has passed quickly. Mr. Shi has been running around in the hot weather, soliciting donations. Now, the facts prove that his efforts have not been in vain, and the results of the fundraising have exceeded expectations by a factor of one. This means that impoverished students who are waiting for assistance have received 100 million yuan in aid.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi joined forces with six other close friends to donate 100 million yuan to the scholarship fund. These six individuals are Mr. Lu Jusheng, Mr. Wu Zhongyi, Mr. Chu Shunwei, Mr. Tan Jing, Mr. Zhu Zhiyang, and Mr. Zheng Hongyan.</p>
<p>These six philanthropists politely declined all the praise that we had planned for them and instructed us not to publish their real names. However, we boldly violated their wishes because we are too excited, and we are also happy and encouraged for the future of impoverished students. We call these seven gentlemen the "Seven Great Philanthropists." They also have a sincere friendship with each other, emulating the style of the "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove" in ancient times.</p>
<p>We hope that this trend of "group assistance to education" can spread quickly and widely. We believe that not only will the Reader's Scholarship Fund Committee benefit from it, but perhaps the lascivious atmosphere of society will also change as a result. (Donation report published in the social services column)</p>

<h3>"Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Purging Corruption Committee" Accuses Li Zhuomin of Neglect of Duty with New Facts</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA), being secretly reported for dereliction of duty and corruption, has been investigated by Supervisor Wu Benzhong and reported to the Control Yuan for impeachment. Yesterday, a person named "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Purging Corruption Committee" sent letters to the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Envoy's Office, the District Procuratorate, the Municipal Council, and various newspapers, stating several new facts about Li's corruption and dereliction of duty. According to the letter: (A) Regarding Li Zhuomin's part, (1) He received traitor Wang Jingwei's assets, intending to embezzle them. (2) He wasted public funds for personal enjoyment. In the spring of the 35th year (1946), he ordered Hu Keshi, the Director of the General Affairs Department, to purchase a piano for 7 million yuan and a carpet for 8 million yuan, in addition to radios, etc., totaling more than 30 million yuan, which is equivalent to hundreds of millions of yuan at current prices. (3) He arbitrarily appointed his relatives. Last spring, the ERRRA selected 30 staff members to study in the United States. Li Zhuomin did not avoid suspicion and sent his younger sister, Li Zhuo, abroad. She was only nominally appointed as a "Commissioner" of the Shanghai branch of the ERRRA a few days before leaving. According to the regulations, the staff members studying in the United States should return to China after nine months, but Li Zhuo has not returned. Also, last summer, the ERRRA decided not to hire new people due to financial difficulties, but Li approved the appointment of his elder sister, Li Qiu, as a staff member of the Agricultural Business Committee. (B) Regarding the allocation of materials by the General Merchandise Purchasing and Marketing Office of the Finance Department: The fraudulent method for distributing electric fans was that half of the total number was actually purchased by buyers, and half was purchased by managing staff for profit, so there were two delivery orders for each large batch of distribution. As of now, there are still 400 units in the Industrial and Mining Equipment Warehouse, and more than 300 units in the store, and they are all trying to disperse them.</p>
<h3>Grievance of a Woman's Chamber: Nominal Couple Sues for Divorce</h3>

However, Xi suffered from a hidden illness and could not have conjugal relations, so she remained a virgin until now. Gu sued for divorce, but fearing that the court would not believe her, she specifically requested that a forensic doctor be sent to examine both the man and the woman to prove her case. It is learned that the District Court has accepted the case and scheduled a preliminary hearing for the 13th of next month.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed Still Present, Flames of Evil Not Extinguished: Raping Female Teacher, Shooting Speaker: The Main Criminal Sun Junbo's Second Trial: Death Sentence? Reduced Sentence? To Be Revealed in Days</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Xi'an, 10th by Airmail] Sun Junbo, the former magistrate of Zhen'an County, Shaanxi Province, who is famous throughout the country for his case of raping a female teacher and shooting the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, resulting in five deaths, was initially sentenced to death in the first instance by the local court and appealed the decision. During the debate in the Shaanxi Higher Court on the 8th, Sun gesticulated wildly, sometimes speaking vividly and dramatically, and sometimes shouting in a high-pitched voice. He vehemently argued that his marriage with the female teacher Wang Huimin was legal and claimed that Wang's death was not due to poisoning. Sun also claimed that the Speaker of the Assembly, Li Weihan, had been selling opium before his death, and the evidence was conclusive. "This local tyrant and evil gentry usually lends money at high interest rates, exploits the villagers, and wants to control the county's administration, create a private military force, and hide a large number of weapons, plotting a riot." "Li's death has eliminated a great scourge for the people of Zhen'an." However, regarding the shooting incident in which he personally led the county government guards and the provincial inspector Ma Zhuoran to Li's residence, he made various sophistries, trying to shirk responsibility. His "touching" and contrived testimony was: "As a revolutionary soldier and the magistrate, regardless of whether Li was killed by me or not, I am undeniably responsible. If I die, please execute me immediately! This case has implicated many of my subordinates (referring to his guards) who have been sentenced to death, and Inspector Ma has been sentenced to imprisonment. It's unjust! China must advocate humanity, otherwise, China will always have problems!" "The prosecutor in the first-instance indictment said that I fired the first shot. That prosecutor is simply disregarding human life!" Sun's argument lasted for an hour and a half, and he sounded like an "orator," so the hundreds of listeners, crowded like sardines in a can, listened attentively throughout. Sun's</p>
<p>The main evidence included letters between Wang and her parents before and after her death, and private correspondence from Speaker Li, but none of them were new pieces of evidence recently presented to the court. Some of the statements might be favorable to Sun, but they were not entirely favorable. Sun's guards, Yang Baojun and Yang Xutang, both expressed their dissatisfaction with the death sentences in the first instance, and said, "We are guards, please explain what the word 'guard' means? If the presiding judge has guards and encounters an assassin, what should the guards do in an emergency?" His words</p>
<p>Were filled with tears, and those who aided and abetted the crime should regret it now.</p>
<p>Ma Zhuoran, the inspector sent by the provincial government to conduct a secret investigation after Wang's death due to the county's residents accusations against Sun, was demoralized and his testimony was weak and disorganized. He began by saying, "I am innocent. I have no weapons, how could I kill someone? Sun doesn't even admit to killing someone, how could I instigate murder?" When talking about accompanying Sun Junbo to the entrance of Li's residence on the day of the incident and encountering gunfire between both sides, "At that time, there was no time to think. If I had taken good photos on the spot as proof for today, I would have been dead, and I wouldn't be here to testify today, and even, state... ..." He "paused" for half a minute before continuing, "I can't even eat dinner today!" The silent audience burst into laughter for the first time. Regarding some of his confessions at the provincial security command before the case was transferred to the court, Ma still denied them. One of the key phrases was, "Killing a county magistrate or two doesn't matter!" He categorically denied ever making such a statement and said that he was coerced when he made the statement at the security command.</p>
<p>Fan Moshi and his wife Zhang Tianzhen also appeared in court today. Fan was originally the director of the Zhen'an Youth Corps Preparatory Committee. According to the first-instance judgment, Fan and his wife helped Sun lure Wang Huimin to Zhen'an to commit adultery and were sentenced to three years in prison. Fan disagreed and cited counter-evidence in this appeal, believing that</p>
<p>Sun and Wang's union was voluntary on both sides, and they did not participate in the introduction or matchmaking, because Sun and Wang were old acquaintances. When Sun was in Xi'an, Wang moved her luggage to Sun's hotel and voluntarily accompanied him to Zhen'an. Zhang happened to go along the way; Sun and Wang were very affectionate on the way; "Wang got up in the middle of the night to cover Sun with a quilt." After arriving in Zhen'an, Wang stayed at the county government that night, not at the Youth Corps. Zhang visited her at night and learned that they were drunk. When she went again, the guards told her, "The magistrate is sleeping with his wife!" The next morning, Wang ordered someone to go to the Youth Corps to retrieve her luggage, and in the afternoon, they announced their marriage.</p>
<p>Wang's father, Wang Xianzhu, insisted that Fan and his wife could not escape their guilt, because Fan had sent a letter to Wang's daughter, luring her to Zhen'an to find a job in the Youth Corps. After she arrived in Zhen'an, all her actions, including her death, were contrary to the</p>
<p>Original plan, and Fan did not notify Wang's parents, so he had to be considered to have colluded and deceived them.</p>
<p>The defense lawyers argued one by one, but the most surprising thing was: "Murderers should not necessarily be sentenced to death, because the punishment of retribution is long gone. Executing murderers is the plan of traitors and communists!"</p>
<p>Will the sentence be reduced? Will the original sentence be upheld? The result of the second trial will be revealed in a few days. However, one thing is worth mentioning: the criminals all felt that the news media had exerted pressure on them in terms of public opinion, and even believed that the urging of public opinion made it difficult for the judiciary to deliver a fair verdict!

<h3>Ning County Goods Station Branch Director Xie Zengrong Not Corrupt; Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office Impeaches Him Twice</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 15th] Xie Zengrong, the Director of the Ning County Goods Station Branch, was impeached by the Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office in March of this year for privately collecting security deposits, not issuing tax receipts, and increasing tax collections on his own. The Ministry of Finance specially sent an inspector to investigate, but no results were obtained. Recently, he was impeached for the third time by the Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office for colluding with subordinates to commit corruption and fraud. The main case of fraud was underreporting the tax on local yellow rice wine. Xie only reported 10,800 vats of yellow rice wine. After a thorough investigation by the Hangzhou Bureau, 443 vats were added to the report. In the 28th year (1939), there were 34,000 vats of wine, indicating that the number of unreported vats was very large. He also accepted bribes to approve the stamp tax bookkeeping of the Qixingyu Cigarette Factory. Qian Baolu, the director of the Xiangshan Office, was not held accountable for contracting the wine tax. The purchased tobacco leaves of the Fujia Cigarette Factory were found to have tax receipts and stamp numbers that did not match. He condoned the Sanhe Trading Company's sale of tobacco leaves and lent the collected tax money. At a time when Chairman Shen has repeatedly emphasized the strict prohibition of harassment and the rectification of officialdom, it is truly unacceptable to violate the law. Therefore, Supervisory Envoy Zhu submitted an impeachment letter, which was sent to the Ministry of Finance by the Control Yuan for punishment.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Field Grain Department Gathers to Discuss; Implement Land Designation and Grain Payment</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] The 36th year's (1947) in-kind land tax collection is about to begin.

It was decided to thoroughly change the established rules and implement the land designation and grain payment method in advance. The implementation plan is outlined below: (1) Complete land designation and grain payment within three months after the start of in-kind tax collection. (2) The rent collection agencies of grain-receiving households should cooperate with the Field Grain Department to handle grain payment and rent collection. (3) Impoverished tenants may have their rent reduced or exempted, and are solely responsible for paying the grain. (4) A committee for urging grain payment and rent collection will be formed by representatives from the party and youth leagues, the county council, the county government, the Field Grain Department, the farmers' association, and landlords. (5) All grain-receiving landlords must first pay the grain before they can collect rent along with the grain. (6) The grain collection office in the townships and towns of the grain-issuing department is absolutely not allowed to concentrate or assign grain payments with any slips or vouchers. Violators will be dealt with as corruption. (7) Tenants who complete the land designation and grain payment within the first month after the start of the land designation and grain payment will receive a reduction of 40% of the rent rate, in addition to the 25% rent reduction.

<h3>Xiamen Railroad Tracks Stolen and Sold in Quanzhou; Fujian Authorities Intensifying Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 13th] There has never been a long-distance railway built within the territory of Fujian Province.

The construction of this line was originally to meet the needs of transporting coal from Longyan. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Fujian Construction Department dismantled all the steel rails of the railway, totaling 280,000 jin, and transported them to Yongchun, where they were handed over to the Huyang Township Office for safekeeping by the county government.

<h3>Representatives of the Far East Basic Education Conference Visit Basic Education Institutions in This City; Indian Representative Lavishes Praise on Shanghai's Elementary School Achievements, Comparing Them Favorably to Those in England</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives of the Far East Basic Education Conference are staying in Shanghai for a very short time. Therefore, though they had only just unpacked their luggage the night before, yesterday they began visiting various basic education institutions in the city. At 9:30 AM, after breakfast at the International Hotel, they were accompanied by reception committee members Chen Heqin, Zhu Junti, Hu Shuyi, Shu Xincheng, Lu Guanliu, and others to visit the First Central National School in the Fifth District. They also attended a welcome meeting held at the school. Principal Hu Huaitian delivered a welcoming speech, and representatives U Ba Lwin from Burma and Dicksey from Sarawak gave speeches in reply, expressing their willingness to do their best to promote international children's communication. At 10:30 AM, they arrived at the Central National School in the Third District of Nanshi to visit the Language Education Exhibition. At 12:00 PM, they returned to the International Hotel for a luncheon hosted by the Municipal Education Bureau. Acting Director Li delivered a welcoming speech, stating that in the past, the Shanghai Concession authorities did not pay much attention to basic education, with only the central urban area having a rough scale. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the war. Currently, the Education Bureau is making great efforts to rebuild the foundation of basic education in order to popularize education. He hoped that the representatives from various countries would provide many suggestions after the visit, pointing out ways to improve. Dr. Luo Ruisi, a representative from the United Nations Educational Organization, and Indian expert Gahada, in their reply speeches, expressed their deep gratitude for the warm reception from the local authorities and stated that future international cultural exchanges would definitely be promoted smoothly. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and hosts and guests enjoyed themselves. At 4:30 PM, the representatives went to visit the editorial office of the China Bookstore on Macao Road. General Manager Li Shuming and Chief Editor Shu Xincheng and others of the bookstore cordially received them. After touring the book and teaching aid exhibitions and educational films, they had refreshments together. Li and Shu both stated that the literacy campaign is a current urgent task, and "China Bookstore" is doing its best to promote various tools to aid literacy in order to eliminate illiteracy. United Nations Educational Organization representative Hubbard delivered a reply speech in Chinese, strongly stating that basic education should be targeted at the "illiterate" common people and should be combined with livelihood education to improve the people's living standards. At 6:30 PM, they went to the Municipal Experimental People's School to observe students' various activities and screen educational films, hosted by the school's principal, Yu Qingtang. At 8:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu, accompanied by Hang Liwu, Chen Heqin, and Li Ximou. At 10:00 PM, they went to the Lyceum Theatre to watch the Yicai School's dance drama.</p>
<p>After visiting various schools, a reporter inquired about the opinion of Indian representative Saiyiding, who said that the facilities and achievements of the schools in this city were comparable to those of some elementary schools in England. China is a large country with 500 million people, and promoting basic education is naturally an important goal. India implemented basic education as early as 1937. The achievements are not worth mentioning, but one thing is the same as China's, India's basic education is also fully managed by the Ministry of Education. He hoped that China and India would work together in education with sincerity, which would help world peace.</p>
<h3>United Nations Educational Organization Forms Chinese Committee; Executive Committee Members All Appointed; First Meeting Held Yesterday, Chaired by Zhu Jiahua</h3>

<h3>Hu Shi's University Plan; Opinions Expressed by Scholars in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Beiping on the 15th] Hu Shi's ten-year university education plan has attracted considerable attention from all parties after its publication. When a reporter inquired about this from several well-known figures in educational circles here, they offered their opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>(1) Hu Xiansu, Director of the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute, believes that Hu's opinion is quite correct, and the five universities mentioned are also quite good. However, the omission of Sun Yat-sen University seems problematic because Sun Yat-sen University has a fairly good scale. With some reorganization, it can become a first-class university, so it may be helpful to list six first. In addition, several second-class universities should also be identified, such as Nankai, Normal University, and Zhongzheng University, which can all be included while assisting their development to bring them up to the first-class level. Regarding using foreign exchange for students studying abroad as funding to develop several universities, Director Hu advocates that part of it can be transferred, but it should not be biased.</p>
<p>Lu Zhiwei</p>
<p>(2) Lu Zhiwei, Acting President of Yanjing University, takes a third-party standpoint. He believes that it is not impossible for the country to concentrate its efforts on developing several universities, but the timing is not yet right. He also believes that Hu Shi's estimate of the amount of foreign exchange is too much. Most students studying abroad are self-funded, and since they are not allowed to go abroad, there is no need to include their foreign exchange. However, in reality, studying abroad is still necessary because China's social environment often cannot match the disciplines. For example, in economics, Chinese society cannot serve as the background for this discipline, while the United States can. "Sun Yat-sen" and "Central" universities are indeed well-managed, but this is subject to restrictions, such as Wu Youxun, who is very capable of running a good school.</p>
<p>Yuan Dunli</p>
<p>(3) Yuan Dunli, President of the Teachers College, agrees with Hu Shi's plan in principle but says that in practice, funding and transportation conditions will limit the implementation of this plan. (4) Zheng Chi, Dean of Academic Affairs at Peking University, fully agrees with Hu Shi's plan. He deeply feels that the 15,000 US dollars the government gives Peking University each year is not even enough to buy magazines. He believes that some disciplines do need to rely on foreigners, but he knows that there are many good professors from the United States or other countries who are willing to come to China, and some are already in contact. Therefore, if the funding is sufficient, the equipment of several universities can be improved without problems. Regarding Zou Lu's question to Hu Shi about Sun Yat-sen University, Zheng said that, as a Cantonese, he is responsible for pointing out that Sun Yat-sen University is not well-managed.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee to Conclude This Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee has decided to conclude its work within this week and has scheduled its closing meeting for this Saturday. Yesterday, taking advantage of Vice Minister Hang's presence in Shanghai, the committee held a temporary meeting. It was decided that, given that the school only had six weeks of classes last semester and many classes were missed, students in the second and third grades will be required to make up the courses from last semester starting on October 1st, which is expected to take one and a half months. There will be no winter vacation next year. Committee member Zhao Zengjue told a reporter: "The Reorganization Committee is about to conclude its work. In the future, work such as adding school buildings and increasing equipment must still be promoted in a timely manner. We hope that the entire school will work together." Zhao said that the Reorganization Committee, alumni association, and professors all unanimously welcomed Cheng Xiaogang's continued tenure as president.</p>

<h3>National Foreign Trade Conference Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday Morning with 155 Representatives from Various Units in Attendance; Assembly Passes Telegram of Respects to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The National Foreign Trade Conference held a grand opening ceremony at 9:30 AM on the 15th in the auditorium of the Bank of China on Renji Road. In attendance were 155 representatives from 33 units, including 19 cities such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Henan, Hunan, Ningxia, Taiwan, Liaoning, Yunnan, Shandong, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Qingdao, as well as overseas Chinese business associations from Nanyang, Mexico, and other regions, the National Industries Association, the National Import and Export Trade Association, the National General Chamber of Commerce, and the China International Economic Association. Guests included Mayor Wu, Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Chairman John Keswick of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Chairman Charles of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, and Tao Si. The conference was chaired by a presidium consisting of Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun Chu, Xu Jilong, Shou Jingwei, Luo Qinghua, Zhang Yujiu, Tao Guilin, Wang Yizhai, and Huang Zaisheng.</p>
<p>The opening address was first delivered by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, who stated: "The current foreign trade problems facing our country are but one link in a chain of urgent economic issues that need to be resolved. In addition to the trade problem with Japan, other issues such as trade with the United States, Britain, Nanyang, India, Australia, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, and France, as well as foreign exchange and tariffs, all deserve our deep attention. Furthermore, how to adapt trade policies to actual needs, how to improve the organization of trade associations, how to strengthen the front lines of foreign trade, and how to effectively promote the modernization of trade management methods are all matters that import and export associations across the country urgently need to discuss in detail in order to find solutions. The National Foreign Trade Conference is being held with this goal in mind. The conference is scheduled for three days, and participants include leaders and experts from industry, commerce, and finance. This conference, initiated and convened spontaneously by the private sector, is a first in our country. We hope that through earnest discussions, we can integrate the opinions of the government and the people into one, achieving the goal of communicating the intentions of the upper levels to the lower levels and conveying the feelings of the lower levels to the upper levels. We hope that both the government and the business community can clearly define their objectives in terms of (A) controlling imports, (B) encouraging exports, (C) opening up foreign exchange, and (D) promoting an import-export chain system, and move forward bravely. This would not only be fortunate for the trade community but also a major turning point for the entire national economy."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Shou's Report</p>
<p>Shou Jingwei, Secretary-General of the conference, reported on the preparations and made two statements: (1) It is a great honor to have the Chief Executive and representatives from various regions attend this National Foreign Trade Conference held in Shanghai. It is especially hoped that the representatives from Mexico and Nanyang and other foreign countries will speak more so that people in Shaanxi can fully understand the trade situation of overseas compatriots; (2) As of now, the conference has received 66 proposals, and 33 units have registered, with 155 representatives (22 representatives were originally scheduled, and 33 were added). Shou also hoped that after this conference, the government would (A) coordinate with national policies, actively protect nascent national industries, and vigorously implement a national mobilization for foreign trade; (B) establish export promotion policies to reverse the crisis of excess imports; (C) establish trade administrative agencies and improve the organization of trade controls; (D) enhance domestic commercial organizations and strengthen close ties with the overseas Chinese trade community; (E) protect the investment interests of foreign businesses and promote international economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech: "Shanghai is the commercial and financial center of the country. Without foreign trade, Shanghai would not have its current status. If the center of foreign trade shifts, Shanghai's prosperity will be difficult to maintain for long. The rise and fall of foreign trade is closely related to China's entire national economy and people's livelihood. All of you present here are experts on these issues, so I will not go into detail. However, as a local official, I would like to offer a piece of advice from the perspective of an outsider.</p>
<p>Regardless of what issues are discussed, it will be fraught with difficulties during this period of unresolved internal strife. In this environment, we should pay attention to one premise: 'Seek everything within ourselves, not from others.' When discussing all issues, we must first examine ourselves. Just now, the chairman mentioned the current situation of the business community and pointed out several reasons for the increase in costs. Although the government bears some responsibility for these reasons, the business community itself has much to examine and improve. We must cooperate sincerely, abandon private interests, and think about the overall future.</p>
<p>One of the major problems in China today is that everyone complains but does not seek solutions. Although some plans proposed by some people are good, they often demand too much under the current circumstances and are extremely difficult to implement. Therefore, when discussing all issues, we should adhere to the principle of 'lowering our sights and avoiding lofty pronouncements.' All reform plans should first start with small things, and we must consider whether it is possible to achieve them by starting from ourselves and working step by step. The business community has always been a pragmatic worker. I believe that the issues discussed at this conference will be practical issues and will provide practical assistance to the development of foreign trade."</p>
<p>Vice Minister Liu's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Liu Siying, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, delivered a speech, stating: "Representatives from all over the country have gathered here to discuss foreign trade issues. I believe that the outcome of this conference will decisively affect the government's foreign trade policy, which is of great significance. The focus of this conference is on principles such as encouraging exports and import-export linkage, as well as technical issues. Regarding the former, in my position at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, I am willing to cooperate with all sectors of industry and commerce to encourage exports. Our goal is not only to balance imports and exports but also to stabilize the national budget. As for import-export linkage, there are some prerequisite issues in terms of technology that need to be resolved. We hope that we can study solutions and work hard to overcome difficulties. Furthermore, regarding labor-management issues, we strongly hope that both sides will cooperate closely so that we can concentrate our efforts on developing foreign trade. The government has no barriers or prejudices against the private sector. We hope that in the future, the government and the people will work together as one. Regarding the number of business representatives to Japan, etc., if all sectors have any opinions, they can put them forward as much as possible so that they can be considered and adjusted in the future. Japan's foreign trade is gradually recovering. We can tolerate its self-sufficiency, but we cannot tolerate its development of ambitions to overwhelm China's trade. We must catch up quickly, not only as a political issue but also as an economic issue. Only through close cooperation from all sectors of the country can we achieve complete success."</p>
<p>Greetings from British and American Guests</p>
<p>Pan Xulun, a member of the National Economic Commission, carefully reviewed China's trade problems and the difficulties of various objective facts, repeatedly emphasizing the Mayor's suggestion of "seeking self-reliance and working pragmatically." Thomas, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, then discussed the issue of foreign investment in China, and gave detailed review to financial, industrial, and raw material aspects. Keswick, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, hoped to strengthen international cooperation, develop the import and export trade of various countries, and wished the conference a complete success.</p>

Gui Huashan, the representative from Nanyang, specifically pointed out the seriousness of the re-entry of Japanese goods into the Nanyang market, hoping that the entire country would pay close attention. Huang Zaisheng, the representative from Taiwan, stated three points. You Shuming, the representative from Guizhou, continued with his speech. Finally, Wang Yizhai, Executive Director of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, delivered a speech on behalf of the Federation, after which Shou Jingwei, Secretary-General of the conference, read out the telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang, which was amended and passed on the spot. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM, and the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury held a reception for the attending representatives at the same location.</p>
<p>Telegram of Respects to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The full text of the telegram of respects is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: With the founding of the nation, there are countless tasks, and benefiting industry and facilitating commerce are the most urgent. This conference was initiated and convened in Shanghai by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, bringing together representatives from chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities, as well as leaders from industry and commerce, and economic experts. Regarding the various practical trade promotion strategies for Europe, America, Nanyang, India, Japan, and other important countries, as well as how to closely coordinate with our national industries, and the active improvement of special issues such as finance, foreign exchange, transportation, and insurance, we will certainly abide by your instruction of 'working together to expand our businesses' and earnestly discuss the economic policies promulgated by our government in order to promote the realization of industrialization and rural economic recovery through the general mobilization of national foreign trade. Furthermore, the Father of the Nation's industrial plan can also be transformed from ideology into practical achievement, in order to live up to Your Excellency's concern for foreign trade and achieve the mission of prioritizing production and exports. We respectfully send this telegram of respect and pray for Your Excellency's perusal."</p>

<p>Next, Zhang Yujiu and Chen Zhongda, representatives of the Import and Export Business Association, spoke one after another. Zhang Yujiu's slogan was "China's Foreign Trade Needs New Policies," believing that imports must focus on promoting industrial production, and exports must be based on revitalizing the rural economy as the greatest principle. Therefore, he advocated dividing industries into four categories: export, people's livelihood, national economy, and basic, and maintaining them according to their nature. He also advocated emulating Britain's "hunger export" policy and engaging in large-scale exports with all efforts. He also put forward various specific suggestions on the four major goals of transport, import control, finance, and insurance.</p>

Finally, Tian Heqing, representative of the China Industrial Association, and Zhang Yaozhang, representative of the Import and Export Industry Association, spoke separately.

<h3>Chinese Stock Market Confidence Shrinks; Yonggong Once Hit Limit Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw general retail investors expressing disappointment at the lack of movement in foreign exchange rates. An initial period of optimism after the opening was ultimately forced to give way to a sell-off. Some major investors even sold off-market. Credit tightened severely, while those delivering goods still seemed crowded. The overnight interest rate rose to 1.8 and 2.25 cents, causing Yongsha to shrink further. Hengshu even engaged in spot selling on the market, eventually becoming unsustainable. Yonggong at #187 and Xinya at #158 saw panic selling, both falling to the daily limit.</p>
<p>Slight rise at the morning opening; increasing after opening. Yongsha was bought by #108, etc., rising to 249 yuan. #232, etc. sold and fell back to 242 yuan and 244 yuan. #235, etc. still buying, and #152 even reselling actual Yongsha. At this point, there was speculation that exchange rates would shrink, pulling Yongsha up to high prices of 249 yuan and 25 yuan. #173, etc. closed positions one after another. First, there was the blow of the exchange rate not moving, followed by the impact of the overnight interest rate rising to 1.8 and 2.25 cents. Some long positions were cut off-market. Hengshu was unable to maintain it and engaged in spot selling of Yongsha on the market. Although #103 bought in the middle, #99, etc. strongly sold actual Yongsha. The situation became even more unfavorable after 11:30 AM. Xinya from #158 and Yonggong from #187 saw panic selling and fell to the daily limit.</p>
<p>Near noon, Yongsha gradually fell to a low price of 236 yuan for spot delivery and 241 yuan for forward delivery, before #226, etc. settled spot Yongsha, and the market closed at 238 yuan and 242 yuan. There was a slight rise after the close due to price reductions.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yonggong fell by the limit and then recovered, a decrease of 10%. Zhongfa Underwear, Jinglun Matches, and China Textile each fell by 5%. Yongsha, Xinyi, Meiya, Huafeng, Xingguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing saw slight declines. China Silk and Xinhua remained flat. Xinya fell by the limit. Lian'an's trading was not widespread and rose by 0.5%. Zhabei was pulled down slightly. Rongfeng and Shangwu were also the same. Forward delivery stocks showed that Yongsha, Xinyi, Meiya, Huafeng, Xingguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing all declined slightly. Various old stocks off-market also showed a bearish attitude, with slight declines. Bank stocks remained stable.</p>

<p>[Another report] According to people in the edible oil industry: The restoration of reasonable free trading prices for edible oil this time can promote the rationalization of production costs for factories and sales costs from producing areas to Shanghai.

The China Trust Bureau will continue its previous method of purchasing rapeseed and will purchase oilseed raw materials in various producing areas again, deliver them to various factories to squeeze 30,000 dan of oil, so as to increase the supply of edible oil.</p>

Rapeseed oil and clear oil were all up by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil soared by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

Fortunately, the American Guang Dyeing Factory purchased thirty to forty pieces of Longtou fine cloth in the middle, which supported the market. Near closing, Longtou fine cloth was most frequently traded from 538,000 down to 34,000, and finally down to 523,000, a decrease of 14,000 yuan from Saturday.</p>

<p>According to people in the hardware industry, the market for zinc and copper and tin was previously sluggish due to the summer off-season. However, with the start of fall sales at the beginning of this month, the market has shown signs of improvement, with the highest increase in zinc and foreign zinc. Yesterday, blue zinc rose to 950,000 yuan per market dan, and Mexican foreign zinc rose to 1.15 million. The industry was absorbing it very actively, and tin foil factories also had strong demand. The price of pure tin soared to 4 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan from last week. Other purple copper and brass also followed suit, rising by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>People's Food Allocation Committee Plans to Establish Storage and Transportation Offices to Purchase White Japonica and Bo Rice for Resale</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the recent increase in the price of white japonica and bo rice is due to the influence of the producing areas. Among them, bo rice is particularly expensive due to the shortage of goods. New rice will be available in large quantities in more than ten days, and prices will soften after it enters the market. The price of indica rice, which is eaten by the common people, remains stable. The People's Food Allocation Committee, in view of the fact that it holds foreign rice, which is not easy to sell when white japonica and bo rice rise in price, plans to establish storage and transportation offices at this time when new grain enters the market. The central bank will provide loans to purchase white rice and bo rice from the producing areas and store them. In the future, the Allocation Committee will still use foreign rice as the main body for ordinary rice allocation, but if there is a large fluctuation in white japonica and bo rice, it can also allocate and sell the stored domestic rice. The task of purchasing from producing areas will be entrusted by the Allocation Committee to rice merchants to handle on their behalf. Because there is concern that designating a small number of stores will easily repeat the "grain loan case" and cause disputes, the Rice Merchant Industry Association will be entrusted to organize a joint transportation company to handle it on their behalf, and the Allocation Committee will give them legal profits. Currently, the Association's written opinion on this matter has not been sent to the Bureau. If it is unwilling to take responsibility, the Allocation Committee will directly find merchants to entrust a small number of stores to handle it.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox: University Student Makes Urgent Appeal to Work Hard to Maintain Studies</h3>
<p>Editor: I am one of the tens of thousands of poor students today. I want to find a kind-hearted person to help me, because I no longer have family support (my family is a poor tenant farmer in Sichuan, which has now suffered from a devastating flood), and even the student canteen that I relied on to maintain my studies after returning from military service is about to close. This puts me in a desperate situation. Autumn is coming, and when school starts, books, stationery, winter clothes, and other things are all necessary, but these cannot be obtained for nothing. I must rely on my own efforts to obtain all of this, so I urgently need to find work (such as a long-term home tutor), and I am even willing to do manual labor. I think someone will give me a sympathetic hand. I will repay those who help me with diligent work. I humbly request that your newspaper grant me a small corner of the service column to disclose my situation, so that those who are struggling in poverty will benefit greatly. With best wishes for your well-being. Reader Huang Daxian, September 14, Communication Address: No. 311, Central Courtyard, Jiaotong University, Xujiahui.</p>

<h3>Enlightenment from a Historical Standpoint: Examining the Near-Century Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>Every era's paintings have a close relationship with the politics, education, economy, and customs of the time. When we observe the dynamics of painting with a historical perspective, whether good or bad, flourishing or declining, its position and significance in history are equally worthy of study. The Shanghai Art Museum Preparatory Office's holding of a century-long painting exhibition has led some who care about the art movement to believe that there are very few masterpieces among the painting relics of the past century, so why promote them specifically? However, if we only talk about painting as painting, this suspicion is not excessive; from a historical perspective, looking back and forth, we feel that the paintings of the past century are worth collecting and exhibiting for those who care about art to explore.</p>
<p>Since the early Qing dynasty, the imperial family used painting to embellish politics, and the so-called "Four Wangs" were most respected. For a time, painting historians competed to imitate them, making Lou Dong and Chu Shan as bright as the sun. After Qianlong, Yangzhou became an economic center of China due to its location as a transportation hub between the north and south. Painters from all directions came to show off their skills and compete for fame and profit, and thus the Eight Eccentrics emerged. They set up different banners outside of the Four Wangs, gaining considerable momentum. Because of the agitation and attraction of these two major schools, if one did not follow the Four Wangs, they would learn from the Eight Eccentrics. Everyone became Shigu, and everyone became Xinluo, focusing solely on "imitating a certain master's style" or "learning a certain master's intent" as their ability. Not only did they not know how to improve, but in the end, they did not even capture a trace of the spirit of the Four Wangs or Eight Eccentrics they were imitating. This kind of malpractice has become particularly prominent in the past century. Except for Ren Bonian, Wu Qiunong, and Wu Changshuo, almost all were victims of this malpractice.</p>
<p>During the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Western paintings followed religious figures into China, and Chinese paintings were greatly influenced by them for a time. However, because they did not suit the tastes of the Chinese people, they did not gain much influence. In the past century, in addition to Western paintings for religious propaganda, copies of masterpieces by famous Western artists and cameras capturing natural scenery have been continuously introduced. Painting historians inevitably abandoned the old for the new, favoring the new and disliking the old, and competing to imitate them, advocating innovation. However, the moods of Chinese and Western paintings are quite different; communication between the natural world and silk is also difficult; and the skills of those engaged in innovation are very immature. This resulted in something that was neither a donkey nor a horse, and their thoughts and opinions on painting became chaotic, leading later scholars astray and at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p>The rise of a generation's painting style seems to require a few famous and high-ranking painters to crown and lead it. The masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties were almost all "official hat" figures. In the past century, initially because of the suppression of chaos and the restoration of prosperity, importance was attached to fame and fortune; later, in order to cope with foreign troubles, everyone discussed foreign affairs. Not a single famous official or noble was skilled in painting and could become a master of the generation. Even those few with fame and status who loved painting, such as Weng Tongsu and Duanfang, only did casual brushstrokes to express their feelings. The fate of painting was in the hands of ordinary people, historical figures, and famous Jianghu figures, either indulging in temperament without knowing the principles of painting, or specializing in copying without any vitality, or favoring ease and simplicity as being superior, and wantonly pursuing strangeness as being heroic. Therefore, very few pure and erudite people succeeded.</p>
<p>There are many ancient Chinese paintings handed down, but some are hidden deep in the inner palace, and some are treasured by private families. They have never been publicly exhibited for everyone to view. In the past century, the imperial families and gentry who were rich in collections, in addition to dedicating themselves to ledger-style records, boasting of wealth, and facilitating sales, have done very little practical work for painting. Gu Xijin was still able to copy the Four Wangs, and he was truly outstanding among ordinary people. In addition, only one or two Qing guests of collectors were still able to view and copy them, and few achieved much. People like Lu Lianfu and Zhang Zixiang were considered fortunate. It is no wonder that most other painting historians with limited experience were unable to progress due to the lack of artistic food.</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, domestic and foreign troubles worsened year by year, and the country was poor and the people were impoverished. Not only did they not have time to promote painting, but they also regarded it as not urgent and often underestimated it. Most of those who could paint sold their art for a living due to economic pressure. They only sought to complete the work, not to be exquisite; they only sought to please the public, not to respect antiquity. This created a rough and superficial style, with very few grand and magnificent works.</p>
<p>Because of the molding of the above-mentioned situations, the painting scene of the past century has been formed. This is very clear and certain. Those who are responsible for the revival of literature and art and have lofty aspirations must prescribe the right medicine and seem to pay attention to the examination of the disease. This centennial exhibition has collected many reports of illnesses for people to diagnose. Together with the "lessons of the past," they can be "horses that know the way" and find the "road to revival." This centennial painting exhibition provides us with at least the following enlightenment:</p>
<p>One: Painters who blindly imitate a certain school will eventually be sacrificed by that school.</p>
<p>One: To innovate painting, one must have considerable cultivation, profound understanding, silent transformation, and not start with destroying the old.</p>
<p>One: It is hoped that famous officials and nobles with fame and status, rich in artistic food and artistic talent, should work hard for art and become leaders of the era.</p>
<p>One: It is hoped that there will be more opportunities for public exhibitions of ancient masterpieces so that everyone can appreciate and observe them. Do not hide them deeply, losing the meaning and effect of preservation and transmission.</p>
<p>One: The life of a painter emphasizes the spiritual and deemphasizes the material; the life of a painter is not limited to the present but extends to the afterlife. It is their duty to endure poverty and hardship. Do not be greedy for cheap profits and abandon oneself carelessly. All the oppression of the times will also stimulate the development of the artistic spirit. The philosophers of painting in the Five Dynasties and the late Yuan Dynasty are worthy of our respect and imitation.</p>
<p>The centennial painting exhibition has already opened on the fifteenth. This is the total unveiling of the painting achievements of the past century. It is hoped that everyone will visit and examine it—comparing how the paintings of the previous century were? Comparing how the paintings of the next few decades will be? How should we promote it? How should we improve it? To inspire the future of the literary and artistic revival movement.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Near-Century Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Li Ximou</p>
<p>Examining the origins of world civilization, it can be divided into East and West. The West is the Italian Peninsula, and the East is our Eastern Asian continent. China adopted the civilization of Mesopotamia and combined it with Indian civilization to form a unique system of Eastern culture. Its painting art is particularly radiant, and its artistic conception and purpose are completely different from the realism of Western painting. It truly possesses the unique style of our national spirit.</p>
<p>Moreover, the characters of our country began with pictographs, depicting the traces of birds and beasts and the images of mountains and rivers. Writing and painting were not separated! Later, as society gradually became more complex, the characters evolved, and painting separated and became independent. The antiquity and profoundness of painting during the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties can often be seen in the bronze and stone carvings unearthed today. The outlines, lines, and coloring of paintings before the Southern Qi Dynasty had the same style as the wall paintings of Indian temples. After the Jin and Tang Dynasties, calligraphy progressed, emphasizing brushwork and advocating style. Painting and calligraphy once again tended to be consistent, using the brushwork and spirit of calligraphy in painting. Therefore, although their forms are different, their meaning and spirit are consistently connected.</p>
<p>During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, painting presented a flourishing image, with figures, landscapes, and flowers progressing in various disciplines. The appreciation of painting was given equal importance with poetry and prose. Whether monarchs or scholars, all engaged in painting to express elegance, forming the golden age in our painting history. Since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, landscape painting has occupied a major position, and the painting style, although claiming to have many schools, was at its peak for a time, but in fact, there has not been much change. Only after Xianfeng and Tongzhi, the international and domestic situations changed suddenly, and academic culture underwent drastic changes. Painting also changed greatly as a result. Some adhered to the ancient methods, imitating ancient masterpieces to seek their skill, while others used Western methods, advocating the integration of Chinese and Western painting methods. People had different opinions and adhered to their own theories, which was different from the situation of respecting the South and belittling the North a century ago. Painting is a cultural product that reflects society, expresses thoughts, and expresses emotions, so today's painting after a century should have its historical value of the spirit of the times, which cannot be ignored. Therefore, if you want to study our paintings of past dynasties, you must start from the past century, and then follow this to explore gradually, which is the meaning of "going far starts from near" and "climbing high starts from low."</p>
<p>European and American countries have always attached great importance to art and culture. Even in remote rural areas, there are art museums established as places for people to cultivate their minds and bodies and cultivate their temperament. In our country, apart from the Palace Museum, art museums are still lacking. Shanghai is an international city and also occupies a leading position in the country. The Education Bureau, in response to the requirements of social figures and the cultural and art circles, established the Art Museum Preparatory Office, and first held a century-long painting exhibition. At the beginning of the founding of the country, culture and education are important. The century-long painting exhibition allows citizens to have the opportunity to appreciate and observe, and the effects of spiritual influence are immeasurable. This is the preface.</p>
<h3>Imitating Tang Yin's "Spring Mountain Companions"</h3>
<p>Wu Dacheng, a native of Wu County, named Ziqing, with the aliases Hengxuan and Quzhai. He was skilled in appraisal and collection. He entered the Hanlin Academy as a Jinshi in the Wuchen year and became the governor of Hunan. In the Jiashen year of the Guangxu reign, he returned to his hometown and taught at the Longmen Academy. He was young and skilled in meticulous brushwork and calligraphy, and in middle age, he added ancient seal characters. He was also skilled in engraving and painting. His landscapes and flowers used elegant brushwork. The hills in this painting are winding, the mountains are embraced by clouds, the brushwork is smooth and the ink is deep, and the atmosphere is rich. The original inscription of Tang Yin is recorded above, and the calligraphy is well-rounded. It can be called a perfect combination. (Chen Yishi's knowledge)</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Near-Century Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The paintings of our country originally shared the same origin as calligraphy. Later, due to differences in complexity and differences in quality and writing, one tended towards symbols for recording events and had a fixed form, while the other tended towards natural shapes and had no fixed state. This is how calligraphy and painting diverged.</p>
<p>Since the Yellow Emperor painted vultures and elephants to quell chaos and drew Shen Tu to ward off ghosts, painting has been dependent on social practical use throughout the Tang Dynasty and beyond, meeting the needs of ancestral halls, drawing ceremonial clothes, and painting clothes and hats. From the Three Dynasties to the Qin and Han Dynasties, the power of the monarch was established and the Rites were formed. All the affairs of painting embodied the political and educational significance of "achieving education and assisting human relations." At the end of the Han Dynasty, the Three Kingdoms were divided, and the political and educational systems collapsed. Thoughts gradually became free. During the Wei, Jin, Southern, and Northern Dynasties, wars continued, and scholars escaped to pure talk to suppress the world. Buddhism took the opportunity to flow in, and religious painting flourished. Since the Tang and Five Dynasties, Buddhism has intermingled and infiltrated with the original Confucian and Taoist cultures, forming a new culture. Therefore, although the art production at that time was still centered on Buddhist paintings, it had broken away from the original imitation stereotypes of the Six Dynasties, creating a new and unique spirit of Chinese art. Only since Wang Wei brought poetry into painting did it become the beginning of literati painting. During the Song (Liao, Jin), Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, painters, writers, calligraphers, and epigraphers were closely linked. Freehand brushwork and light ink, writing intention and conveying spirit, painting and calligraphy presented a trend of complementing each other.</p>
<p>In the sixty years of the late Qing Dynasty, after the Opium War, it was no longer possible to close the country to self-sufficiency. Externally, there were the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion. Internally, there was the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Hundred Days' Reform. The fate of the country was in the midst of storms, and the old cultural tradition also shook its foundations. When the sea ban was lifted and the enlightenment movement rose, Western art gradually entered this land, and there was a confrontation between new and old painting schools. During the Republic of China, after the "May Fourth" Movement, which was praised as the Chinese Renaissance, and the "July 7th" War of Resistance, which launched the national restoration movement, China went from being weak to one of the five powers. The cultural topic also went from wholesale swallowing of Western culture and accepting the legacy of ancestors to the integration and exchange of ancient and modern Eastern and Western cultures, stepping into a new era of containing the essence and discarding the dross. Painting art corresponded to the spirit of the times and entered a new stage. In summary, from Xianfeng and Tongzhi to the present, it has been about a century. Chinese painting and Western painting began as incompatible as water and fire, confronting each other and governing each other, just like the beginning of the confrontation between new and old cultures. Then they induced each other, drew on each other, mediated each other, and improved each other, which was no different from the integration and reconstruction of new and old cultures. During this century, Chinese painting, like its country and its entire culture, has undergone enormous tests and has been baptized by fire. At present, it also carries the glorious mission of inheriting the past and opening up the future. There is no doubt about it. However, today's commentators often praise the paintings of the Jin and Tang dynasties, and everything after that is despicable and unworthy of discussion. They do not know that one era has the artistic tasks of one era and cannot be compared in this way. If what they say is true, then painters can lay down their brushes after the Jin and Tang dynasties. Therefore, if we want to correctly estimate the value of the paintings of the past century, we must first abandon this kind of antique-style prejudice and start from history before we can recognize that the national art of this era has indeed inherited the great cause of the predecessors and nurtured new embryos. Its acceptance of Western art is the same as the acceptance of Indian Buddhist art in the Han and Tang dynasties, and the development trends of the later period can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The Art Museum Preparatory Office is holding a painting exhibition, starting with the near-century painting exhibition. In the future, it should follow the flow to explore the source and successively hold exhibitions of the Four Wangs of the early Qing Dynasty, and even the Ming, Yuan, Song, Tang, Jin, and Han dynasties, exploring in stages, intending to start from near and far, knowing the present and learning from the past, facing the art and historical value of painting in the past century, and also correcting the antique concept of respecting only the ancient.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art Museum Preparatory Office organized the centennial painting exhibition, which opened yesterday at the Cultural Association on Nanchang Road. The only thing is that this exhibition has a lot of reference value for the changes in modern Chinese calligraphy and painting. This publication has previously made some comments, and now it is specially compiled several related articles to prepare readers for reference. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>Every inch of mountains and rivers is bought with an inch of blood. Suspended for one day.</p>
<h3>Four Red Figures</h3>
<p>— Ren Weichang</p>
<p>Ren Xi, a native of Xiaoshan, named Weichang, was skilled in flowers, birds, landscapes, and especially figures. His study of antiquity was profound, so he was able to get rid of all vulgarity. His brushwork was vigorous and could approach the seat of Zhanghou. His works include "The Sages of Yue," "Immortals," and "Wine Labels," which have been handed down to the world. The brushstrokes in this painting are firm and resolute, using only the central brush technique. The four beauties in the picture have curved eyebrows and full cheeks, approaching the style of the Tang Dynasty. It can be called Weichang's deliberate work. (Chen Yishi's knowledge)</p>
<h3>Preface to the Collection of the Centennial Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Gu Yuxiu</p>
<p>The painting of our country has a long history, beginning in the Tang and Yu dynasties and taking shape in the Three Dynasties. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has become even more magnificent. Buddhist solemnity, colorful paintings, and portraits of meritorious ministers in the Lin Pavilion all convey spirit. Talented people emerged in the Jin and Tang dynasties, and the Six Canons were fully prepared. The artistic conception and spirit of the Song and Yuan dynasties all reached the top grade. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, the subtleties and mysteries have reached their extremes. The spirit of the Chinese nation has been entrusted. In the past century, the world has changed, and culture has been exchanged. Painting has also been influenced by it. The Shanghai Art Museum Preparatory Office has collected more than 300 works by deceased masters of the past century and held an exhibition. It has also selected 24 masterpieces and reproduced them into a collection for viewing and observation. Is this also what the art-loving gentlemen like to allow? This is the preface.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Meng Xiaodong</h3>
<p>— Drum King</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng's sixtieth birthday saw many famous Peking opera performers from Beiping come south to celebrate, the most notable being Meng Xiaodong, a female performer. Those in the south who had heard of her fame were eager to know the extent of her artistry. I have been traveling to Beiping for ten years recently, and I have listened to Meng's plays a total of six times. In terms of ten years, it should not be so few. However, the "Winter Emperor" (many who supported Meng in Beiping called her the Winter Emperor) lived a secluded life in Beiping and often suffered from minor illnesses. During these ten years, she performed less than ten times. I heard "Catch and Release" three times, "Scolding Cao" twice, and finally "Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans." The last one, Cheng Yanqiu's famous play, is very difficult to perform well. These were all Uncle Yu Shuyan's signature plays. Meng performed them with mellow and rich singing, and her strength captured the essence of Yu's style. Listeners thought that Yu Shuyan had been ill for a long time and never performed publicly. Therefore, they were happy to buy a goat (something unexpected). It is not by chance that the reputation of the Winter Emperor has increased year by year.</p>
<p>Singing depends mainly on the voice. Those who do not have a unique gift cannot enjoy great fame. Twenty years ago, when the Winter Emperor performed in Shanghai, my old friend Mr. Ma Er (i.e., Feng Shuluan) praised her greatly, saying that this woman's voice was excellent, especially suitable for singing Tan school. Feng never easily praised anyone. I had heard her sing several times at that time, such as "Empty City Stratagem" and "Hongyang Cave," etc., but I felt that her voice was better than ordinary female performers, but her art was not particularly different from others. Later, her reputation rose sharply, and she performed "Visiting Mother" with Lanfang, one sheng and one dan, which can be said to be the ultimate in matching. Then, the two became a couple, and I thought that this song should only be available in heaven. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last long, and they soon parted, and we music lovers were able to enjoy our ears. This was not what we had originally hoped for.</p>
<p>The Winter Emperor's voice is broad, bright, and sweet, and she is especially good at using it appropriately. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, the Tan, Sun, and Wang schools stood side by side. Tan's voice was actually not as good as Wang's or Sun's, but Jiao Tian's cultivation was unique, and he was able to gather the great achievements of his predecessors. Therefore, his style was unique and crowned the times, and the theory was unanimous. The reason why Uncle Yu was able to succeed Xin Peifu was also because of his style. The Winter Emperor focused on learning from Yu. When Uncle Yu was ill, she often stayed at Yu's residence to take care of him. Yu's successor, Ms. Yao, often told people that the Winter Emperor's care for the patient was better than a filial daughter's care for her biological father. When Yu's illness improved slightly, he would definitely teach her all his heart. The Winter Emperor's ability to achieve today's achievements is also truly admirable for her dedication to research.</p>
<p>I was overjoyed when I first heard "Catch and Release" in Beiping. I thought that her singing and tone were actually in the style of Tan Yu. After three days of separation, how could you not look at her with new eyes? Today, in the male actors' circles, Tan Fuying is the best sheng (male role), Jin Shaoshan is the best heitau (painted face), and Zhang Junqiu is the best qingyi (female role). However, it is difficult to find someone who is good at both singing and acting. Is Meng Xiaodong close to it?</p>
<p>The Winter Emperor's voice cannot exceed Xiaotan's, but her style is far beyond Fuying's. Someone told me that in addition to personally studying with Uncle Yu, Xiaodong had been with Bao Jixiang for the longest time. Old Bao had a wealth of drama knowledge in his mind. He researched every gesture and movement in every play in great detail. He had performed with Old Tan, so he described in detail to the Winter Emperor all the movements in Jiao Tian's plays. Therefore, when Xiaodong came on stage, her attitude was calm and generous, and even male actors could not match it. We said that Su Liang's acting was poor, and Shi Sen's was sickly. Dang Ying's stage steps were especially casual and ridiculous. The Winter Emperor stood out from the crowd, and it cannot be said that she was not outstanding.</p>
<h3>News Clippings</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Xiaozhu</p>
<p>At a meeting of the hiring committee of a university in Shenyang, a certain dean and the president had a dispute over something. The dean said to the president at the time: "What do you know? I have two doctoral degrees in Germany. Where is your degree? In Germany, seven students had more than 40 world-renowned professors. Have you ever heard of it? I fought in the Anti-Japanese War for eight years and have more than 120 books. Where are your achievements?" The audience was stunned.</p>
<p>Police officers in Fengrun County go out every day to inspect the cleanliness of the streets and households. If they find unclean families, they will fine the housewives and make them wear pointed paper hats and parade through the streets. Housewives throughout the county are panicked.</p>
<p>The three universities of National Peking, Tsinghua, and Nankai jointly recruit students this summer. One question in the history test was "What was discovered at Zhoukoudian?" A student answered: "The body of Zhang Shenfu was discovered"; also, in the Chinese test, please explain the phrase "Hu'er." A student answered that "it was the nickname that President Hu's mother called him in his childhood."</p>
<h3>The Spooky Phone Call</h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>After three years in the military camps of Africa and Italy, medical officer Qiu was finally on his way home. His wife, Marie, hearing this exciting news, prepared to plan what appropriate things to say when her husband made his first phone call ashore. This phone call must be perfect. But the more she thought about it, the more confused she became and the less she could find anything appropriate to say!</p>
<p>Later, she simply had no choice but to ask her cousin for advice. Her cousin was an army lieutenant who had just returned from overseas. He smiled at her and said, "What? There's nothing to it. When the phone comes, just say, 'Hello, dear!' He will say, 'Dear, how are the children?' Then you tell him that the children are fine. Wouldn't that open the conversation? That's too easy!"</p>
<p>One evening two days later, the phone rang as expected. After a long time, his voice was finally heard.</p>
<p>"Hello, dear!" Marie said happily.</p>
<p>"Hello, dear!" the medical officer replied loudly.</p>
<p>Then, he got stuck, and she got stuck, and they couldn't say anything. Marie was so anxious that she remembered the lieutenant's formula in a panic. She screamed, "How are the children?"</p>
<p>The father, who had been away from home for three years, said in confusion, "Huh, good! Good!"</p>

<h3>A Week in Film</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>"The Devil and Daniel Webster" is Worth Recommending</p>
<p>Just on the strength of Edward G. Robinson, Margaret O'Brien, and Walter Huston starring in a film, it's already worth watching. At the very least, it's much stronger than those colorful films.</p>
<p>The story of "The Devil and Daniel Webster" is similar to "National Velvet," set in a small American village, delicately and vividly depicting this group of kind villagers, their work, life, and some hopes. Through the life of the Stone family, the whole village's activities are brought out, and the two innocent and lovely children—Mary and Daniel—are the main thread connecting all the characters. The author, through humanistic descriptions, elegantly and gracefully completes this "The Devil and Daniel Webster." If we don't demand too much, then this film is worth recommending.</p>
<p>Obviously, the actors surpassed the director's achievements. Edward G. Robinson's Daniel Stone deeply carves out a kind and simple farmer. Margaret O'Brien's Mary and Walter Huston's Mr. Scratch are indeed a pair of gifted young actors. They naturally and intimately portray the characters' personalities. Especially Margaret O'Brien's scene when watching the circus is particularly impressive, making people applaud for her. In addition, James Craig's Jabe Stone and Anne Shirley's Belle also perform quite excellently.</p>
<p>Of course, the director's achievements should not be ignored either.</p>
<p>The Nonsensical "Keep 'Em Flying"</p>
<p>"Keep 'Em Flying" is an old film starring Jeanette MacDonald and Robert Young. The story depicts the love history of a news reporter and a singer, interspersed with an anti-Nazi spy story. If you want to find rationality in this spy story, that's simply illusory. Everything is like child's play in the playwright's depiction. Those many Nazi spies are just used to create excitement, in order to complete this farce. Therefore, the tone of this film is very low.</p>
<p>If you want to satisfy your desire to hear Jeanette MacDonald sing, then this film will also disappoint you. Robert Young's performance is also unremarkable.</p>
<p>The Unremarkable "Flight Command"</p>
<p>Hollywood films mostly depict the "King Kong" and "hero" types. So, after watching too many, it really feels a bit "tiresome." Even if we take a step back, the male protagonist Jamie Grayson in "Flight Command" is just a frivolous American youth who indulges in romance and casual love affairs in life. During combat, he displays personal heroism. Although he ultimately serves the country, such a character should still be negated.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Robert Taylor's Jamie Grayson lacks any outstanding performance. Among the other actors, only James Stephenson is somewhat satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Still Watchable "I Met Him in Paris"</p>
<p>The director's achievement in this film is also very mediocre. This film depicts a young man who is physically and mentally damaged after returning from war. Therefore, he refuses to see his family and fiancée, and his life becomes lonely, isolated, and eccentric. Later, he falls in love with and marries a country girl due to their daily interactions, which restores his joy in life. Such a simple story emphasizes psychological portrayal, so it is called a "literary film," but it doesn't have any special features. However, under the direction of John Cromwell, the atmosphere and mood of this film are very good, especially the scenes at the factory and the seaside are exceptionally beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>Loretta Young's performance as the female lead is better in the first half of the film, but lacks brilliance in the second half. Robert Young, as the male lead, puts in considerable effort, and Herbert Marshall is competent as the musician.</p>
<p>"Buck Privates" and "The Gay Falcon"</p>
<p>"Buck Privates" is a slapstick comedy starring Abbott and Costello. The whole film is nonsensical, using the tension of racing to stimulate the audience, but it's actually an old trick. Another film, "The Gay Falcon," is a low-quality action film from a small company, with chaotic fighting and nothing to recommend it.</p>
