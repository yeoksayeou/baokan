<h3>國府改組已告完成　主席闡明三點要義　仍盼中共改變叛亂態度</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕國府十八日上午十時慶祝奠都南京廿週年紀念，蔣主席親臨致訓，略謂：國府奠都南京已廿年，而三民主義尚未完全實現，國計民生尚未安定，政府同仁深感惶愧。然此廿年來國家所遭遇之內憂外患，其危險艱難之情形，實屬史無前例。國民政府幸賴國父英靈之護持與全體同仁共同一致努力奮鬥，終能克服一切困難，奠定建國基礎，殊堪欣慰。現在本府改組完成，即為本黨還政於民理想之初步實現，政府今後當向民主憲政之途邁進，尚盼各同志一本以往之精神，同心一德，戰兢努力，以完成實行三民主義，建設新中國之使命。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國府改組完成之日，正値國府建都南京廿週年紀念（十八日）。蔣主席特於是日午十一時五分在國府大禮堂接見中外記者，發表談話，此為勝利遷都以來，主席在首都舉行第一次記者招待會。主席蒞臨禮堂時，著草黃戎裝，胸佩青天白日勳章，頻現笑容，似示其心中之無限愉快。吳鼎昌，彭學沛，李惟果，沈昌煥，曹聖芬等均在塲，中外記者出席一十餘人。</p>
<p>主席與各記者寒暄後發言謂：今日為南京建都廿週年紀念，特請在京記者談話，今日亦為國府改組之日，命令業經發表，大家想已看見。此次國府改組，為中國革命史上之新階段，其重要意義有三：第一，此次國府改組，除國民黨外，各重要黨派均已參加，年來期望之多黨政府，今始實現，此多黨政府成立，即國民黨還政於民之第一步，從此進入憲政民主時期，且由此可更進一步，儘速完成統一和平之目的。第二，我們要實現還政於民，實施民主憲政，不能待至共黨武力叛變結束之後，同時，對共黨武力叛變，希望早日結束，解除武裝，不再作亂，俾有機會參加政府，達成統一。第三，一年餘來，共黨屢稱國民黨無還政於民之誠意，由此次改組，可知共黨所說的話不正確，同時，不等待共黨叛變結束後再實行改組，即表示國民黨實現，至十一時半散會。</p>
<p>主席談話原文</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國民政府蔣主席，十八日於國民政府奠都本京廿週年紀念及國民政府委員會改組之日，特於上午十一時五分，在國府禮堂招待新聞界，到中外記者廿餘人，吳文官長鼎昌及彭部長學沛亦到會。蔣主席即席發表談話，並由沈秘書昌煥翻譯，其談話原文如下：今日國府委員會之改組，乃我國訓政進入憲政之重要步驟，此次改組，使各政黨及社會賢達得以參加全國最高之政治決策機構，改組以後，國府委員之分配如下：國民黨十二席，民社黨四席，青年黨四席，社會賢達四席，五院院長為當然委員（五席）。目前五院院長尚係國民黨員，是以國民黨共佔十七席，其他政黨黨員或社會賢達出任院長之時，則國民黨所佔之席次，自將減少，國府委員名額，原定為四十名，國民黨員之席次，原定為二十名。現現僅發表二十九名，如將餘額十一名補足，則國民黨員之席次，成為四十席中之十七席，尚不足全額之半數也。此次改組政府，民社黨與青年黨之人選，由兩黨自行推定，社會賢達之參加人選，則徵得其本人之同意，各政黨參加立法，監察兩院以後，繼之以國府委員會之擴大範圍，今已完成多黨之政府矣，再進一步行政院改組完成時，在新任院長之下，各部會首長，亦將由政黨及社會賢達分别担任，我國之政府權力，以往屬於國民黨負責，此次改組以後，將由政黨及社會賢達分別担任，我國之政府權力，以往屬於國民黨負責，此次改組以後，將由國民黨·民社黨·青年黨及社會賢達所共同行使。國府委員會將在此過渡時期行使其職權，執行國民大會之決議，則完成本年十二月廿五日開始行憲之準備工作。抗戰勝利以後，我國之政局，可劃分為兩個階段，第一階段乃藉美國之調解，以勸導中央參加政府，而將其軍隊編入國家之軍隊，第二階段，始於國民大會之召開，民社黨，青年黨及社會賢達之參加國大，共同制定憲法，足徵全國人十，對於政府實施憲政之努力，無不熱心贊助，値茲世局不斷演進之時，我國需要和平與建設，日益迫切，是以國家之統一，務須於最短期間促其實現，民主與憲政，自不能因等待中共，而無期拖延，倘中共放棄其以武力奪取政權之行動，能為國家之團結統一而合作，則該黨仍有參加政府，從事建國工作之機會。為解除我同胞之痛苦計，誠盼中共最後仍能改變叛亂之態度也。</p>
<p>吳文官長談話</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕國府吳文官長頃發表談話如下：國府改組之意義，在擴大政府基礎，由一黨負責而進入於多黨共同負責之政府。今日蔣主席對記者談話已有詳盡而明確之說明。關於國府組織法第十五條「國民政府主席對中國國民黨中央執行委會負責」一語，此「負責」二字，乃基於第十條「國民政府主席由中國國民黨中央執行委會選任」之規定而來，蓋就主席本身之地位而言，自不能不對其產生之機關負責，並非謂國民政府委會之決議，尚須由中國國民黨裁定，國府委會為「最高國務機關，業經組織法明白規定也」。</p>
<h3>新任國府委員　定期宣誓就職　就職禮後舉行首次會</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕新任國府委員定廿三日宣誓就職，國府委員會於就職禮後舉行首次會議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕民社黨張君勱徐傳霖兩氏署名之信件，十七夜由楊俊民自滬攜京，交蔣勻田。據蔣氏稱，內容僅為該黨滬方情形。又徐氏雖仍堅辭委，惟蔣表示徐有遠見，抱負甚大，任府委甚為適當，故仍將邀其聘任。至該黨內部問題，對孫寶剛等仍主嚴勵制裁。</p>
<h3>徐傅霖今晉京</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨徐傅霖氏，應蔣主席電邀，定今晚晉京。徐氏昨對記者稱，伍憲子氏日前來信略謂，病體未復，兩星期後始能來滬。至民社黨府委缺額一人，將仍由張君勱氏提名後，交該黨中常會通過。關於黨內爭執，渠認為純屬意氣用事，張君勱氏對之並不重視。日前湯薌銘等假借中常委九人名義，反對張君勱，其中伍憲子，李大明不在上海，梁秋水並非中常委，張東蒸早已脫黨，故實際上參與其事者僅為五人。以五個人發動「清黨」實為笑話。渠表示將以中立地位，勸諭彼等放棄幼稚之舉動。</p>
<h3>張東蒸聲明　與民社黨內爭無關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕張東蒸氏委托民盟葉震義代表聲明，謂脫離民社黨已久，故與該黨目前之內爭無關。四月八日民社黨一部份常委上主席之函，雖用其名而未得其同意，以後民社黨內如用其名，一律作為無效。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨常委伍憲子，張東蓀，沙彥楷，湯佳心，李大明，汪世銘，孫寶剛，廬廣聲等八人，昨日發表共同聲明，對該黨主席張君勱有所指責。</p>
<h3>孫院長來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕新任國府副主席孫科，十八日下午十一時半專車赴滬。孫之兩位女公子，近由美學成歸國，十五日返抵滬。孫氏將與其多年未見之女公子，在滬渡週末，定廿日返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕孫院長被選任國府副主席後，記者特往立院訪謁，立申賀意。孫氏謙稱，在國府組織法中，副主席職權，僅為主席因事故不能視事時，由其代理之。此外無其他規定。記者詢以新國民政府之性質，孫氏答曰：「國民政府組織法，係根據現行約法而制定，目前仍可認為訓政，不過行政上稍予改動。」記者又問，國府組織法，是否尚待完成立法程序，孫院長答，向不由立院討論。新聞界對國府組織法，如有意見，盼儘量提供參考。孫氏並就政院設置新聞局一事釋稱，新聞局長雖為特派，不能與各部會首長並列，且不能出席行政院會議，僅能列席</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十八日電〕立法院院長孫科頃告本社訪員稱，國民政府新組織法所規定國府主席與副主席由國民黨之中央執行委員會選任並向之負責一項條款，少數黨雖提出修正之要求，但不擬加以修改。此條係根據訓政時期之臨時約法所制定，在本年杪實行國民大會所議定之新憲法前，仍屬有效。孫氏並否認此一條款乃國民黨繼續訓政之謂。</p>
<h3>馬占山抵瀋</h3>
<p>將召集舊部效命國家</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕馬占山十八日下午四時許由平乘專車抵瀋，日內就副長官職，此六十三歲抗日老將軍，精神矍鑠，東北各界人士予以熱烈歡迎，據談：民國廿一年離開東北，十五年後歸來，萬感交集，今後仍以一腔赤誠，貢獻國家，並表示來東北後將召集其舊部，為國家效命疆塲，恢笑星東北秩序，聞長春一帶有地下軍組織，馬今後將注意此等武力之整編工作。</p>
<h3>挽救紡織業危機</h3>
<p>經濟政策會決定對策</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕經濟政策委員會十八日上午九時舉行例會，到徐堪·俞鴻鈞·賀衷寒·樓桐蓀等。陳立夫主席。會中對如何挽救紡織業當前危機一案，曾詳加討論。按我紡織業當前最大危機有二：（一）日本紡織品有捲土再來重霸東亞市塲可能；（二）外匯調整後，棉花成本增高數倍，又因禁止出口，紡織業前途岌岌可危；會中決議：（一）利用外棉成本太高，決擬增產計劃，使土棉能自給自足。（二）日棉生產應以能使其足數自用為標準，若有餘額，應由中國收購。此事由外交途徑向愛帥總部交涉。（三）提倡節約，將所可出口之棉紗，盡量運至南洋，以替代日本原有市塲。（四）提高棉織品進口稅率。</p>
<h3>我對韓國態度　美報極為重視</h3>
<p>以首頁刊載王外長函</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十八日電，紐約時報以首頁篇幅登載該報記者就我王外長對於朝鮮問題致美國務卿馬歇爾函件。關於此事，該記者自南京發來長達一百五十字之專電。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕司法院副院長兼公務員警戒委員會委員長賈振氏，以積勞成疾，患喘病已達六年之久，上週二入滬宏仁醫院治療，前晚病勢轉劇，陷於彌留狀態，復出院返寓，延至昨日下午六時四十分，在寓逝世，享年六十三歲。遺體於當晚八時半舁入萬國賓儀館，治喪事宜及大殮日期，須待賈氏生前友好鄭魯·焦易堂·傅汝霖·趙丕廉諸氏來滬後，再行決定。</p>
<h3>霸縣收復</h3>
<p>〔中央社保定十八日電〕軍息：克復勝芳國軍，復以破竹之勢，沿大清河西進，十七日下行三時完全佔領霸縣。當晚達雄縣城郊，已與容城南下國軍會師。</p>
<h3>聯合國滬辦事處　數週內正式成立　特別小組已由紐約來滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十八日電〕聯合國秘書處已宣佈，聯合國上海辦事處，將於數週內開幕。上海辦事處之作用；將為一情報處，但亦將為經濟社會最近所成立遠東經濟委員會服務。聞遠東經濟委員會已定於本年六月在上海舉行第一次會議也。由賴伊所指定之聯合國秘書處特別小組，已首途赴滬，準備上海辦事處之開幕事宜。該小組由聯合國執行官詹尼錫率領。詹氏已於昨日乘機離紐約。按聯合國成立太平洋區辦事處，係聯合國成立全世界情報處之一部份，原計劃係經聯合國上次大會通過者。</p>

<h3>開放日本私人貿易　中菲均表示反對　已向遠東委會提出照會</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕中國與菲律濱正反對美國重行開放日本方面之私人貿易，該兩國已向遠東委員會盟國國際貿易局提出照會，聲明日本私人貿易之開入放，足以妨礙賠償品之繳付，故表示反對。該貿易局曾分別向會員國詢問何時始可開放日本私人貿易？菲律濱即答以私人貿易應暫緩開放，以待賠償品之切實分配，中國亦表示同樣態度，蓋恐將來日本生產激增後，日本將藉口要求扣留目前擴充賠償之設備與工具。其他盟國並不表示意見，但聞對於美國建議並不熱心。各該國雖在原則上贊成日本經濟務須恢復，並謀自給自足，但首先必須確定各該國個別利益可以不受影響，然後始可實行日本方面私人貿易及有關各事。中菲兩國並認為日本貸幣尚未穩定至開放自由貿易之程度。</p>

<h3>霍寶樹對記者報告　視察黃泛區經過　災民待救孔亟盼各機關合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總署長霍寶樹，於週前偕中外各界代表視察黃泛區災情，業於前日先同聯總人員等八人返滬。昨日下午四時接見記者，報告視察經過，及救災復與計劃。據霍氏表示：復興泛區，最主要者在農業及水利二問題，計劃在三年以後將泛區恢復至戰前原狀，並改善生產，務使可利用之地皆能耕種。但目前必需救濟災民，最低限度，須使彼等求得一「活」。</p>
<p>霍氏繼稱：目前復興工作又較以前理想為困難，盡八年以來，黃河改道之後，將黃河帶到泛區，如再遲一年半載墾殖，該處土壤將起變化，成為荒墟，故急應在六週內，雨季下種以前，運往種子，以備種植。</p>
<p>至難民歸河南一帶家鄉者，每日平均約二千人，然返里後，赤手空拳，衣食住皆成問題，行總聯總雖竭力救濟，奈粥少僧多，一時蜂擁而至，不及照顧，故亟盼其他各地機關能合作，勿使全部難民同時而歸，希望能生產者先返，開始工作，消耗者暫予緩歸，但在人情上而言，又不便分散老弱婦孺，故對此問題，亦感困難。</p>
<p>行總現已整備糧食二萬噸，救濟難民，正陸續運往中，一部分業已到達。政府方面，已批準本年度救災及複興經費一千四百億元，聯總供給本年度之物資器材約值美金一千二百萬元。</p>
<p>霍氏又謂：黃泛問題可稱世界上最大待救濟工作之一，希望各國人士均能予以協助，根據中國人民固有之堅強毅力，相信在初步予以物資上幫助後，即可自動努力生產。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中國銀行業的前途</h3>
<p>中華民國銀行商業同業公會聯合會於本月十五日在京召開大會以來，業於日昨閉幕。此數日來，全國銀行金融界的盛彥，畢集於首都，誠為一時之盛會。我國的金融經濟基礎，本甚薄弱；經過了長期抗戰以後，原有的基礎曁見動搖，又加以一般國民經濟的衰落，復興建國，有望於銀行金融業者實至鉅。所以當全國銀聯會集會於首都之際，我們主席以日理萬機之身，特頒訓辭，有所勗勉。在主席的訓辭裏，對於今後銀行金融業在復興建國的大業上，尤寄以殷切的期望，其言曰：「今後所希望者，惟在金融界應如何協同努力，使國家預算更達平衡，幣制整理，確定基礎；務以安定民生，增益生產，促進建設，盼能廣抒卓識，薈集　　，以達成金融界為建國應負之使命」。這幾日來，在南京集會的全國銀聯會的確能仰體，主席的一番德意，對於此後銀行業應與應革諸端，討論不厭求詳，觀其所通過的決議，數量之多，牽涉之廣，就可見這次全國銀聯會的召開，對於今後我國銀行業的發展，必有重要的影響。</p>
<p>綜觀此次全國銀聯會所通過的決議，其較重要或牽涉到一般人民利益者，約有下列各端：（一）關於戰前存款增加給付問題，其決議有四點：（甲）戰前儲蓄存款，仍照原額以複息計算，（乙）請政府迅定處理辦法，（丙）政府未公布處理辦法前，由政府命令全國司法機關停止接受此項訴訟案件，（丁）組織請願團向政府請願；（二）實施銀行專業化；（三）改變現行政策，加強國家銀行效能，其中尤集中於中央銀行。重慶，南昌，九江，瀋陽，北平，青島，漢口，西安各地俱有檔案，要求加強中央銀行與商業銀行之聯系，以實踐其為銀行之銀行的使命；（四）簡化表報手續，劃一檢查機關。從而可知，此次全國銀聯會的召開，其所討論到的，不僅有關銀行業本身的事項，抑且牽涉到與國家施政有關的大計。對於銀行金融界當前的若干問題，我們站在人民的立塲，願略申我們的所見：</p>
<p>第一，關於戰前存款的給付問題，這與其說是銀行的問題，不如說是國家的問題。商業銀行在戰前收受存款，在銀行與存戶間所立的契約內，原不曾逆料到幣值之有這樣的舉動。嚴格地講，戰前存款的給付，在銀行應該是沒有問題的，就是戰前存入多少，加上明定的利息，應該給付多少。幣値的變動，非銀行所能控制，銀行是不能負其責任的。晚近法院的判決，今銀行以千倍給付，於法令旣無所據，於法理亦有未合。不過幣值的暴跌是事實，若使照原來的數字給付本息，這在存款人自然是一種極大的損失，而在幣值暴跌的過程中，各銀行又未始沒有運用存款人的資金，獲得暴利的事實。所以對於這一問題，我們一方面要顧全事實，它方面又要顧到法律。法院的判例照千倍給付固為不當，此次銀聯會所通過的決議，按照原額以複息計算，亦沒有顧全到事實。我們贊同這一點，就是請政府迅定辦法，俾有適從。銀行與存款人的關係是一種私的關係，此與公債庫券持有人與國家的關係不同；所以對於此一關處理，未必同於公債庫券。我們要請政府迅將這種處理私關係的辦法明定出來，在確定辦法之際，對於幣值慘落乘機暴利的一宗事實，自不能加以忽視。</p>
<p>第二各地銀行金事業對於中央銀行的業務提案甚多。這表示兩點：第一，各地銀行金融業對中央銀行期望之般，第二，中央銀行對各地銀行金融業失望之深。從這些提案裏，他們或者希望中央銀行能夠真正成為銀行之銀行，或者希望中央銀行能夠與商業銀行加緊聯　。這俱足以表示中央銀行還沒有成為銀行之銀行，與商業銀行的聯系還不夠緊密，因而有這樣的呼聲。中央銀行的作用一度發揮於國民革命軍出師北伐平定中原之際，再度發揮於建立法幣制度之時，晚近以來，中央銀行的成就，消極方面似尤多於積極，在抗戰的當時，或因情形特殊，或因機構繁複，俱足以阻礙中央銀行發揮其獨特的作用。目前的情形與戰時不同，戰時的設置應取消就應取消，以免影響國家銀行的獨特機能，這些戰時設置中的一個較顯著者，就是所謂四聯總處。此在戰時，或有必要；但在目前，是否應該任其繼續存在，似乎也値得考慮。有此一機構在，對於中央銀行的達成其所負銀行之銀行的任務，容或不無影響。各地銀行金融業，對中央銀行旣期望甚殷，此點也似乎値得研究。</p>
<p>至於說到銀行專業化，這實在是早已應該有的事。銀行專業化這一詞所指的不單是國家銀行，並且連商業銀行也包括在內。國家銀行固應專業化，商業銀行亦應專業化。今日的商業銀行有以實業為名者，有以農工為名者，有以工礦為名者，顧名思義，它們原本各有專業，但其間名實真能相符者又有多少；全國銀聯會是一種商業銀行業的組織，在其所召開的首次大會裏，旣提出了銀行專業化的呼號，我們願他們先能就本身做起。</p>
<p>國人所經營的現代銀行業，到召集還不滿六十年。銀行業在中國的歷史雖短，對於中國現代化的功績實鉅。然而就銀行金融業的本身言，它對於一般國民生活的現代化所加的影響，似猶未夠。今日與六十年前的情況，相差的距離並不太遠。京滬密週一隅，而兩地的金融往來，尤賴匯付，以視他國的一紙支票通行全國，我們似乎還在中古的封建時代。銀行業在中國雖是一種新興的現代企業，但尚充滿了陳舊的中古制度。如何使中國現代化，銀行業所負的責任匪輕。欲使中國現代化，尤望銀行業本身能夠現代化。如今全國銀行業旣有銀聯會的組織，我們希望他們能向此方面邁進。</p>
<h3>牯嶺大火　千餘戶被焚</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌十八日電〕夏部牯嶺不幸發生大火災，十六日晚十一時，牯嶺後街四十一號住房失慎，燃及板壁，火勢由後街而下街·新路，正街，迄至兩街嚴仁記旅社，被波及者店鋪住房達千餘戶，全部結菓付之一炬，災民達二千五百餘，損失約二百億。起火原因迄未查出。王陵　由漢抵滬後，十八日赴牯嶺督辦善後。</p>
<h3>不顧我國要求　暹限制華僑入境　定下月一日施行移民律</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷十六日電〕頃自權威人士處獲悉，暹羅移民規定將於五月一日起，開始施行。此項規定原擬四月一日起實施，因李鐵錚大使之建議，而暫時停止，其準許中國人入境之數目（每年一萬人）係根據過去廿年中國前往暹羅人數之統計，此頗不公平，因一九三七年至一九四五年間，中國因日本封鎖而與外界隔絕，中國人民前往暹羅者，僅一萬八千人，中國曾力爭對中國人赴暹者，應規定合理及公平之數目，因此項新規定之突然退出，將使業在途中或準備來此者遭遇困難，故中國當局曾要求將此規定延至五月一日施行。據悉：中國之要求，已遭拒絕，暹羅之籍口為自去年中暹交通恢復後，中國人進入邊境者，平均每月達一萬人，其中甚多人，竟帶來霍亂及其他傳染病，暹政府及人民鑒於此種情況，乃決定制定法規，以限制大批華人入境。</p>
<h3>蘇北民間印象記（五）　關於「自首自新」的事</h3>
<p>— 本報記者章繩治</p>
<p>關於「自首自新」的事，原來的用意，亦是出於政府的寬大為懷和不咎旣往。李司令官說：「因為匪區內的民眾，多數是被壓迫而不得已出此的，所以才有辦理自首自新的動機。但是這事行到各地之後，辦理的人往往不明所以，馬馬虎虎的敷衍了事，因此有的時候，反而弄出亂子來。例如三餘鎮的一役，就是「自首自新」的人，利用這個機會，做了內線，使得三餘鎮吃了眼前大虧。」</p>
<p>記者在海門的時候，曾經接到署名「海門流亡人」的一封信，其中有一段說到自首自新的事，原文寫着：「以寬大為政，辦理自首自新，開始感訓，不特毫無收效，抑且身受保障，變本加厲，供給匪方情報，得有機會，力圖反抗，損失甚巨，而地方下層匪幹，以中央政策寬大，膽愈大而心愈辣，漕運更烈，殘殺尤多，毫無畏懼，如此剿匪永無希望」。</p>
<p>由此觀之，上面李司令官的一段談話，實在亦是有感而發的。</p>
<p>我們曾經在唐家閘參觀過「感訓所」，這是屬於「青年訓導第一大隊」的，其中包括投誠的二〇九人，自新的一九四人，被俘的九五四人，在這一千三百五十七個隊員中，中間還有六個是女性。</p>
<p>這裏經司令部的邀請，讓我們和這些自新的人，找個機會隨便談了一談。當我踏進感訓所的門口，第一個感覺是：他們都是受着極有紀律的軍事化訓練。</p>
<p>一個曾經當過「民兵」的鄉農，和我談話的時候，滿口是「土地改革」，「清算」和「坦白」等待的新名詞，他那一副呆頭呆腦的姿態，配上嘴裏那麼一套玩意兒，我簡直要笑出來，疑心自己是在看「皮人戲」。我問他是不是識字的，他很爽直的說：「不識字！」</p>
<p>一個曾經在「華中銀行」做過女職員的賈宇，我問她是如何過來的？據她的自稱：她原是如阜女中的學生，新四軍來了，她就在華中銀行做女職員後來如阜收復了，跟着她亦自新了。她那天穿着一套棉軍裝，長得胖胖的，或許人我們這一批突如其來的記者，問得太緊促了的緣故，表情上很緊張，面壓上燒得紅紅的，不時用兩隻手來自己替自己撫摩着。</p>
<p>他說話略帶一些口吃的成份。關於他的學歷，他說他在復旦大學吟完三年後，因為抗戰的關係，後來到都</p>
<p>我們問她對於共黨有什麼見解？她的回答是：「我不是做政治工作的，僅僅是一個數數的抗幣的銀行職員吧了！」</p>
<p>後來大家談起家常來，她說：「我的父親和哥哥，現在還是住在離如阜三十里外的鄉下，父親尚是一個現任的鄉長呢！」她又說：「自從自新之後來才解到這裏來的，到現在亦將近兩個月了。」</p>
<p>我問她在這裏生活很好吧？她點點頭，沒有表示否認。我們再問她家裏是不是知道這種情形呢？她說，她是可以通信的，不過必須經過檢查。</p>
<p>最後，我們又會見了「高郵縣縣長」楊天華，他那天因為身體不舒服，大家就在他自己的房間裏談了相當長的時間。看起來，這位「縣長」在感訓所裏比較最受優待的一個，單獨住一個房間，有一張床，有一張寫字枱，櫃子上有些筆墨紙張，還有一副象棋子。他用一包「克雷斯」，頻頻地向每一個來訪的記者滬過來，並且殷勸地　　坐。</p>
<p>我們在談話之外，每人分發一張油印的「幾年來的回憶」。在他過往的歷史中，知道他曾經任過指員員，專署史中，知道他曾經任過指領員，志主感主任秘書，和地方法院院長，民國二十八年開始參加工作，直至三十五年十二月二十四日在高郵縣長任內，才率領一隊縣府特務連投過來的。</p>
<p>他說話略帶一些口吃的成份。關於他的學歷，他說他在復旦大學吟完三年後，因為抗戰的關係，後來到成都四川大學才畢業的。此後又曾到「抗大」住過一年。</p>
<p>在這一連串的談話中，突然有人問他在做縣長期中，那一點認為最成功。</p>
<p>他想了一想，然後期期艾艾的說：「不貪汚，不誇大……」。但是當我們靜靜地聽他講的時候，語氣似乎有些硬得勉強。</p>
<p>最後，他又說：當他投誠的時候，他的太太正在生產，所以沒法一同出來。於是有人問他是不是會發生危險呢？他一時面部表情，的確有些白裏發青，接着無可奈何的說：「那就很難說了！」</p>

<h3>對奧和約討論進展遲緩　外長會議又起爭執　奧外長拒色南國領土要求</h3>
<p>〔聨合社莫斯土十八日電〕奧國外長葛羅勃今日壽請外長會議從連完成奧國和約，惟一般觀察家感覺莫斯外長會議陷於　局於　局，成立奧國和約之希望，已迅趨淡蕩。各代表團中若干德國專家，現皆準備啓程前往柏林，靈已拋棄對德和約續求進展之希望。奧外長葛羅勃德請外長會迅速行動時，切言和約如將應屬奧國之任何領土給予南斯拉夫，奧政府決不簽字。葛氏之言，大半係簽覆南斯拉夫副總理卡臺琪昨日所提要求，並否認有人種，　化及其他理由，須將奧國土地移交南國。南斯拉夫係要求奧國之卡林西亞區南部，比一邊界問題曁奧境德人財產何者可充賠償之問題，今在外長會議迫近攤　局面。四外長今晨會議，對於奧國和約之第一項大問題，即如何處軒奧境五十餘花果山流徒人民，蘇外長莫洛托夫與西方三國外長發生衝突。開美代開團準備攤俾，俾資料恢復走定奧國和約能否在此完成。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十七日電〕四國外長會議本日繼續討論對奧和約，首先討論和第十六條，即關於流亡人民之條款，此乃對奧和約中爭論最烈之一點。各外長雖顯然竭力妥協，但終未能獲致協議，座將該項條款擱軒不論，但四國外長同意將因戰事面前往戰國之德人，加以遺同本國，僅對於若干細則未能獲協方我。至於其他十七項軍條款，其中六條獲得一致通過，三條獲得局部通過，四項未加討論，二項則陷於璺持養態。未能成立協議之二項條款，為第十七條（關於限制奧國家隊之條款）及第二十七條（關於奧因軍事研究與配備之條款）。四國外長雖一致同意奧國陸軍員額為五萬三千名，海軍五千名，軍用飛機九十架，包括戰鬥機十架，但蘇聨希望規定奧國祇得使用國內製法武器與配備，為他國外長所反地，致未成立協方我。第二廿七條係法國所提出，規定與國不得使用若干配備，製造若干物品或進行戰爭性質之研究究，蘇聨對此表示附議，但英美則反對。法國另一建方我，主張在奧國設立軍事專家委員會，監想軍事條款之實施，經討論之後，法國自動收回該項建議。四國外長定明日討論對奧和約經濟條款。據觀察家稱：國國外長須舉行六次或七次會議始能將對奧和約討論完畢。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹諸國家　共黨力謀控制</h3>
<p>〔聨合社紐約十七日電〕共產黨控制巴爾幹蘇四衞星國之內幕現漸明瞭。據聨合國方面所接報告，蘇聨久曾訓令南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·希臘及保加利亞最高共產黨中央委員會處理領土問題，監督希臘連境軍事行動，並措導阿爾巴尼亞與保加利亞·南斯拉夫及羅馬尼亞等國之政治思想。鞭中一項計劃擬利用遊擊戰術將希保二國所屬馬期頓結合成為一自治邦，然後申請併入南斯拉夫。保加利亞則自希臘土耳其攫取全部塞萊斯，從而獲得韃靼尼爾海峽與愛一集海港口。馬期頓自治宣言原定今春發表，但因英美採取強硬行動，以致中止。此事可以說明英美何幫堅持聨合國機構希臘邊境糾紛調查團應留駐原處監視希臘邊隆，一面準草擬報告書，戾恐報告書朱提出及安全理事會未討論之前，或將啊生突然變化。希土所屬塞萊斯中，除蘇聨所欲之軍事基地外，均歸保加利亞，足微莫斯土方面現已放棄希臘參加其巴爾幹衞星國之奢望。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「海上三老」之一袁履登，原判無期徒刑，經最高法院發還更審，昨日下午在高院續開調査庭審訊，由邱煥瀛堆事任審判長。袁之親友聞訊前來旁聽者甚衆，座無隙地。袁衣米色夾袍，入庭時，門弟子均起立爲禮。</p>
<p>據袁供稱：我因上海難民協會曰秘書長事務羈身，及經濟困難，於抗戰起時，未能離滬。三十年春，李士羣與丁默邨會找虞洽卿，因洽老去香港，逢請我蟬聯租界工部局華董，因我任工部局華董十餘年之久，無法推辭，曾將經過情形函吿在香港的杜月笙先生，可傳來證明。僞米糧統制會原來就有的，我任該會主任委員不過是帮忙而已。該會僅管理民食一部份，曾向日軍交涉撥一部份軍米作爲戶口米，從米代敵人採購軍糧。配給戶口米每人每日食米二斤至卅三年四月戶口米中斷，遂於五月十日左右稱病入虹橋療養院，嗣即辭職不幹。繼任者爲陳國權。僞市商會理事係經公推，因我戰前即爲市商會理事。同業公會早已存在，並非由我組織。物資統制審議委員會委員我未出席過。保甲籌備委員會主任委員，係因向日軍交涉解除封鎖，經民衆公推者。該會沒有訂過規則，沒有淸查戶口。僞新國民運動促進委員會委員，不過掛一個名字，從未到南京去參加會議。僞報所發表的文章，均係陳彬穌，袁殊假借名義代撰。末稱：我平日做事全憑良心，只知道救人，帮人忙，想不到這是犯罪。經庭上訓斥，這些全是通謀敵國的事，如何能以帮忙一語諉過。袁連稱：我知道錯了。嗣傳訊在押之唐壽民，陳國權，周純裕，林康侯作證。最後由辯護人江一平律師起立，請於下次開庭時傳杜月笙，奚玉書，何德奎作證。並請求延期審理。庭諭改期再審，被吿接見家屬後還押。袁於還押時，對兩旁親友掛手，連呼：「對不起」。</p>

<h3>垃圾傾下浦江調查尙無實據</h3>
<p>運輸船隻不合用　已飭承包商掉換</p>

<h3>標賣舞弊嫌煩疑案宣判　潘樹藩等均無罪　謀員警福利無犯罪證據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣主席令上海市政府逕送地院審理之前市府物資管理處標售布疋舞弊案，迭經黄光鈺推事開庭審訊，辯論終結，於昨日宣判其主文：「潘樹藩，徐靜波，廖公劭均無罪」。判決理由略謂：被吿潘樹藩，曾任市府物資管處副處長，實際負責處務。查該處於去年二月十四日標售藍鳳牌漂布五千八百疋，公吿僅二天，核與滬市府物管處標賣物資辦法第三條：「應於開標前三日至五日公吿」之規定不符，且得標之榕茂棉布號尙朱加入棉布業同業公會，潘樹藩旣係實際負責人，自難辭失職之咎，此乃行政上處分問題。至於該被吿之刑事責任，因乏圖利之積極證明。第二被吿徐靜波，係市警局員警福利委員會主任委員，第三被吿廖公劭，係警局總務處長，亦同時被控，於榕茂得標後，强迫商人照原價每疋加一萬元讓售一千疋，指爲共同貪汚。現經査明，讓售之舉，旨在謀員警福利基金，幷經兪副局長叔平批准，無爲私圖利之可言，且賀回時亦無強迫情形，更無犯罪之證據，故一併諭知無罪。</p>

<h3>米麥大豆　大批在洽購中將運滬浪漫　民食</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕致府對各項主要民生物資之開源計調，可綜述如下：（一）米，糧食都已委托中信局向越遏緬訂購洋米二十萬噸，按月規定數量運送，原定本年六月底可全部運抵我國，惟因海運上之困難，截至此時爲止，共運到六萬噸左右。有關方面除派員赴緬暹督運外，並已與中外輪船公司交涉，以期早日運畢。（二）小麥，中信局代表正在阿根廷接洽購買小麥十萬噸，大體已無問題，正式合同尙待簽訂。由對方負運送之責，在上海交貨，運費則由我負担。（三）大豆，中信局預定在東北收購二十萬噸，惟以便格之波動及運輸上之困難，能否收足尙難斷言。有關人士表示：以大豆平價供應本市油廠，每月是否能經常維特八千噸之數額一點，全視運輸情形而決定。大豆運輸之最大困難在東北鐵路運量不够，其次海運船隻不數。央行張總裁最近與陳延烱氏治商，希望能在鐵路運輸上多方協助。只要遝輸無問題，自當足量供給。</p>

<h3>早報館十大醫院　合辦防癆檢查</h3>
<h3>健康第一！</h3>
<p>本報讀者即可申請免費檢查</p>

<p>肺癆在我國傳佈之劇烈，極爲驚人！據專家統計，死亡率爲十萬人中有四百人，如全國以四億五千萬人口計，每年死亡約一百八十萬人，較之抗戰八年，死於戰塲，或死於兵災，釩饉……者，尤爲衆多。所謂殺人不見血者，其惟肺癆病菌乎！上海現有肺病患者十六萬人，每年死亡一萬六千人，較全市所有傳染病死亡總數尤大！我國防癆設備簡陋，患者多屬貧苦階級，尤其戰後生活艱難，環境惡劣，生此「富責病」後，類多無力醫療，輾轉傳染他人，造成恐怖現象！又據專家統計，死於肺癆者以二十五歲以下之靑年爲最多，此皆我國家建設之棟樑，未來之主人翁，倘不及早防治，後患不堪設想，我親愛之讀者，其亦有感於斯乎？</p>
<p>本報承十大醫院合作防癆，作初步之檢查，完全為倡導性質，所望社會賢達，賜予協助，　策進行，惟撲滅此可怕之病菌；尤望靑年讀者，切勿諱疾忌醫，自貽伊戚，此則本報同人愛護靑年之微意也。（按：免費簡則，醫院一覽，申請表格，及檢査程序等，均將於廿日起，陸續在本欄發表，諸希公鑒。）</p>

<p>五時正，裁判吳守衡，巡邊員樂秀榮黄仁彝，登塲執法，攝影後，靑白隊向客軍獻花，漢城隊回敬錦旗一面，於是戰幕揭開。劇戰至八分鐘後，時客軍再度傾師來襲，孟義良解圍救駕，未幾，瞿永福於廿五碼處絆人犯規，金容植操刀，未獲功效。變方混戰多時，均無收獲，至廿分鐘時，禹晶煥帶球深入，嚴士鑫失脚漏空，孟義良回身乏術，遂被金容植偸襲成功，一比零客軍首開紀錄。靑白傾師殺奔客軍腹地，羅壽福虛擺華容道，金祿生球中横木彈出。上半時完畢，靑白以一球落後。</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>易陣　再，客軍以安鍾秀易出林暢植，靑白亦以薛沛然易出瞿永福，靑白進裏，未獲成功，五分鐘時鄭南湜邊陲疾進，近門力射，爲秦必高接住。靑白再度來犯，球爲車淳鍾撲成角球。至廿二分鐘時，靑白顧以撤下野，易上姜聞淸，前鋒爲之一振，羅濤福臥地射門，不幸鼻部受傷，不久重行登塲，時靑白屢有妙射，惜乎客軍防守嚴密，未見功效，卅七分鐘時，吳祺祥於十五碼外犯規，金容植任意球開來，稍歪野逸，混戰頗久，笛聲長鳴，客軍以一比零戰勝靑白。</p>

<h3>澈底解決棉紡危機　決統籌產銷計劃　民營紗廠與官方意見已一致</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市棉紡織工業界，近以常局施行之管制政策，議價與成本價脫節，原棉供應困難，致對訪業之再生產及生存問題，乏生窒礙。茲經迭次研究結果，對今後棉編來前途之開展，已獲具統籌產銷之澈底改革計劃。聞所採原則，不外原料統籌供應，資金統籌籌劃，成品統籌配銷。讠項澈鍍計劃，業由各民營紗廠代表，與紡管會吳兼主委，及中央銀行張總裁，迭次會商，雙方決見已見一致。一俟下週政府改組就緒，各院部人事部署定奪，該項澈底計劃，可望積極推進施行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會常務理事王啓宇·榮鴻元·唐星海·郭隸恬籌，於昨日下午三時，往訪中央銀行張總裁於張氏寓邸。又於四時許，往讠紡管會吳兼主委，對維持紗廠再生產及生存問題，治談頗久。聞雙方意見頗為一致。吳瘺主委對王氏等辭去紡管會委員之職，表示挽留之意云。</p>
<p>昨據本市棉紡業某權威語本報記者：自本市棉紗議價與市價日益拔開後，政府　售張江結果，徒使中間商坐獲鉅利。直接消費者旣未受益，國庫亦遭損失。而民營紗廠繼續依照議價開紗，亦遭困難，且結果名譽道德，兩皆受損。故處茲環境下，當局所施行者，不啻為一種消極打擊性之管制。在花果山無辦法中，統籌產銷計劃，尚不失為一種鼓勵懷之管制。訪項計劃推行後，原料由政府　統籌供應，資金亦由政府統籌籌劃，政府以定貨方式，委旗各紗廠代製成品，給予各紗廠以合理之利潤·該花果山利潤，雖不能供事業之發展，惟再生產與生存問題，已可迎刃而解云。</p>
<p>六區棉紡開理監會</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會，於昨日上午十一時，召開臨時理監事聨席會議。當由常務理事王啓宇·肇鴻元·唐星海·郭棣活·竺報告同紡管會辭去委員職之經過，各出席理監事，咸表王氏等達次居間白衝，極為辛勞，一致應予擁護。惟認為此次辭職，當非王氏等之個人問題關係，實係整個紡織業之生存問題。蓋紡織肇　係整個國計民生，對復興經濟極關重要。現當局管政策對同業生存已感威脅，實需鄭重商討收革辦法。聞訪會擬於最近期間召開臨時會員大會，對該業目前處境之困難，已發表一宣言，準備向社會各界呼籲云</p>
<h3>統債穏定</h3>
<p>公債昨見穏定，雜牌平平。業中人五〇三室等先出後進，過程遂由低而高。統函晨開一四一〇〇元，低價一三二〇〇元，高價一四七〇〇元，最後在一四〇〇〇元徘徊，較前收漲起七百元。統戊亦升三百元，甲乙丁徵降一百元，一般人心對改組後之政府，咸有樂觀氣氛，成交維五百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>外股盤挫</h3>
<p>外股昨略見遜色，散戶及資料夾券帮中人略有脫手，怡紗自四〇五〇〇元元開市後，高價未越四一〇〇〇元，即告下游，低價達三九一〇〇元，而後轉呈盤局。橡皮股買風復起，結果較前收計業廣航業鋼一各跌一成光景，餘設亦稍落。</p>
<h3>美金債券　可向銀行抵押　七折取用現金</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕財部負責人談稱，美金公債及短期庫券之推銷辦法，經財政部考慮，已決何守正該項債券可向銀行抵押，以七折計算，取用現金。如此，一面可使市塲靈活，同時戶使購者踴躍，而乏行之主旨及維持其信用之目的，亦可達成。</p>
<h3>銀根抽緊原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前市上銀根略緊，外傳乃國行暗中有意抽緊者，經記者向各大銀行方面詢問結果，證明當時銀根略緊之原因，主因乃結售一部份棉花之故，同時此時各廠家正繳綱一部份稅款，用去一部頭寸，至於美金僨券固亦吸收一部份游資，如浙江實業銀行一家即吸住三十億元以上，但乙整個之中市塲而言，影響並不大。</p>
<h3>國行發行局　否認乏行大票</h3>
<p>中央銀行發行屬負責人聲稱：最近外傳該局即將發行萬元大票之說，實無所聞。記者復詢以五〇元關金券目前乏行數額究有若干，據稱發行確數，未便奉告，總之發行額與市上需要相較，所差尚遠，各行莊一再向國行請換取關金券，僅能酌量付給。</p>

<h3>產價報抵拋售數增　米糧市勢略緩和　市長表示從嚴取締黑市</h3>
<p>昨日米市塲南北兩處共到一千八百石左右，來源雖稀，而內地產價已轉跌，並蘇錫一帶將有一二百艘食運申，已在途中，負高能損毀遠客，貨如湧到，勢將回跌，當在意中。市塲白元陰元站定之格，塲外市面跌云萬元，尚少受主。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕社會局於拋出白粳紅秈及丁貢共九千包，價不前日同。市勢因而緩和不少。市塲交易除承購配米外，甚為寥　落，塲外粳薄稻喊價仍在十七萬以上。</p>
<p>超過限價定當嚴究</p>
<p>〔又訊〕吳市長昨日下午於市府會議室接見刻者談：米市連日波動，因產區報漲，現無錫蘇州等地，業經政府　下令抑低，上海黑市價格雖甚猖獗，目前亦已回挫。今後食米限價仍為十三萬元，社局今後將繼續拋售大量白米洋米，若米商再將定價超過限價，定當嚴究，黑市一律嚴取締。又：市長定今晨八時三十分，再度召見米商業米號業公會負麗人，查寶三瞿振華等，聞將商討減低門售價格。同時社憶售峭價亦將比例核減，因產地米價昨日均已下跌四千元不等，今後勢將續跌。</p>

<h3>洋莊茶實銷少</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，自貨方售意稍形轉佳以來，趨勢已不若日前之鬆濫，行情亦得能勉給不墜。而交易仍因吐納談判缺乏順利，是以殊少精彩。連日祇僅汪裕泰午昌等尚有染指，至於內銷茶供求難分上下，過和平靜非凡。</p>
<h3>桐油價高銷滯</h3>
<p>桐油市況，昨日以漢口頭寸奇緊，銀行方面濟運不及，庫存薄弱，匯水陡漲，致桐　油亦錄漲六萬遠了　。茲愁：昨市除內銷有小量做開外，外銷大盤市面，以國外價格，再度削降，內價已超出國外現價，無甚做開。</p>

<h3>魚販昨已復市　變判展延一星期　雙方在外覓取解決途徑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日本市魚販罷工，經社會局勸導之下，全體魚販已於昨日復市。緣魚販業同人聨豪會為反對魚商業同業公會設立聨合收銀處訂行統一收款辦法，於前日宜罷市。經社會局召集調解，決定聨合收銀處暫緩設立，魚販乃先行復市。</p>
<p>昨日下午該局再度召集雙方代表商討未了事宜，因魚販之堅持反對聨合收銀處組織，數談判未有成就。惟雙方因念以往素來合作，不願因此遞生裂痕，故商定雙方在外另覓解決途逕，期限一星期。一星期後將談判結果呈報社會局。</p>
<p>至海產運銷聨合會因魚販罷市，到綱四千餘擔因延擱遭受之損失，要求魚市塲賠償事，昨因代表未到，故未曾談及。</p>

<h3>陜北訪問散記（三）　「梁山泊」漫步</h3>
<p>— 延安九日快訊　本報記者張僊洲</p>
<p>如果把陜西地圖劃成兩個圓，一個是以關中爲中心，一個是以延安爲中心，洛川應該是分界點。洛川以南現在正是賽滿人間，以北則是風沙彌天，寒暖不定。</p>
<p>延安是被人看作「梁山」據說過去有許多人上這兒來是因「逼」而來。我在這裏住了一週，延安使我覺得和西安的許多事物，有着距離。這裏沒有洋房毗連，大街交錯。只是單純的兩條大街，形成不規則的丁字形。延安在十幾年前只不過是四五千人的小鎭，二十三年中共到此以後，經過了十幾年的經營，把它吹成了「赤都」，使一般人覺得有些像「水滸」中的「梁山泊」。據說在人數最多的時候，有十萬人上下（二十八九年左右）。延安給我的印象是雜亂，幼小而又樸實，總之是一個小城。</p>
<p>城內雜景</p>
<p>在延安你會覺得樹木少，民衆少（現有城內人數七八千人）荒地少，店舖少，街房的門板少。不管是圍繞着延安四週的土山，或者是陝北「邊區各縣，山嶺上除了一片一片開墾過的山頭種着田禾外，沒一處成林的地方。但是你也會覺得大禮堂多，空房子多，婦孺多（比較的說）；在這幾天中，我們一直看了六七個大禮堂，這些大禮堂，除了少數修得相當考究外，大部份都不太精美，沒有油漆，雕花，天花板。只有在進口上多有一個圖案畫，代表着禮堂的標誌。</p>
<p>這裏物價很昂，約比西安高二分之一。生意大部分沒開門，只有街邊有許多小攤，售物以香姻及日用品最多，全由西安運來，偶爾也有以前遺留下來的香姻，鉛筆但都壞到不能用，火柴却尙可。民衆對國軍的關係很好，老年人則非常高興，靑年人在街不多看見，婦女們是希望快一點渦安寗日子。回來的人一天比一天多。如果你常到街上去蹓躂，你會覺得延安比較前兩天，暖和了許多。</p>
<p>人去樓空</p>
<p>我們曾經訪員的住宅及機關，這些地方現在者是人去樓空，滿院狼藉，雖然大部　築得幷不堂皇，但和陜北老百姓的住宅比起來，要好得多。</p>
<p>楊家嶺在延河北，離延安約五六華里，這裏是中共中央，有一座很大的體堂，體堂門上一顆　「紅星」及鐮刀斧頭標誌。堂內舞台很宏大，中共近年來（一九四〇以後）全會均在這裏開。在堂北側是一所大舞應，地板上磨得很光。聽說在這裏有過多次的舞會這是中共要員的「業餘活動勝地」。在向北有飯堂，圖書館，相當華麗，不下西安。延安附近由於木料缺乏住舍很少有房子，都是用土坯搭成拱形的窰，窗子很大，光綫很足，從平民到中共要員，都住着這種房子。毛澤東的故宅在中共中央間書館北邊的坡上，窰內放着木器數件，外面有一間小灶房，這裏和其他房間內唯一不同的是殘破的沙發上，有彈餐。這一院內，四個窰洞，再向東北鄰接着有八個窰洞建築得一模一樣，聽說這就是劉少奇，周恩來等的住宅。</p>
<p>共軍總部</p>
<p>十八集團軍總部（即共一個禮堂但幷不太大，也很簡陋，體堂旁邊有三座窰，每座下邊是三個窰洞，這是彭德懷及林彪等在很久以前的辦公室。這許多客房是依山而建，四邊隔橋，有一院落，內外兩院，每院四間，外院是辦公室，內院是朱德的臥室。室內有木器多種。（事實上不止朱毛室中的本器多到處一樣，做的是很堅固，全油作黄色。）每兩個窰洞接連在一起，中間有小洞相通，墻根附近不能走，地下尙埋着沒掃出的地雷。在大操塲上，站立着許多俘虜的民兵，逝些人都是衣衫襤褸，但面無　色，對延安之戰，他們好像幷沒有很大的感覺，頗有點「吊兒浪蕩」的神氣。操塲以北，有一座營殿式的大　，我們因時間關係，沒有去看，就想忽而返。</p>
<p>棗園全貌</p>
<p>到過延安的人，都羽「棗園」是風景最好的地方，這是「勞動英雄」吳滿有的住所。自從這位「英雄」「自動」把土地「捐獻」之後，就成了中共要　的住所。園中有很大的梨樹，桃樹，現在都是含苞欲放，一片春意，全園有三百多畝地，中有小舞應一座，地板上磨得光光的，墻上掛着一張匾，上書「人民救星」四字。舞應的西南方不遠處，有三座洋房，據說這是某國願問住的地方，在共軍佔據延安的時候。這裏經常住着二十餘人。我們在道三座洋房附近的廚房中，會看到十三個西式灶爐。毛澤東在這裏也有住處，據說這裏是他夏天的別墅，地方是在半坡上的高處，可以俯看全園。房子是小敎堂式的洋房，上邊搭着許多茅草，大約是蔽護物。房內有三間辦公室，兩間宿舍，和一間設備得頗完備的「無綫電室」，現在重要東西全都搬去了，只留下一些禾器和墻上過去的電綫殘痕。</p>
<p>棗園門口上有延圍二字，這是中共到延後改的名字。康生·陳雲的住舍在毛的住屋附近，都是一列四五個窰洞，園中近山的地方，都有防空壕穿到山底的石岩中去，相當危險。</p>
<p>舊城荒凉</p>
<p>延安舊城，自二十八九年日機狂炸之後，一直再沒建築，如今輕車馳過，看見的只是遍地瓦碟，滿目荒凉。</p>
<p>賀龍總部現在是農兵醫院，中共黨校的墻上遺留着反對中央的標語，和其他各地一樣，院內沒有大樹，只有丈把高的柳樹。</p>
<p>延安大學，在新市塲南端，除了大禮堂和廚房以外，敎室也只有兩三座敎室，和百餘個窰。校內的過道上有許多散兵溝。地下埋着東西，當我走過的時候，看見幾個士兵從地窰掘出許多木板和破書。</p>
<p>陜甘寧邊區政府，是記者們的住所，二排窰洞住了許多「來賓」，當年林伯築辦公的地方，現在是我們的飯堂。這裏的窰洞內部全由石灰泥刷，光潔整齊，室外全用石條切墻，幷築着走廊，在貧瘠的陜北，這的確算是够堂皇了。</p>
<p>邊區參議會，只有一座禮堂，新華書店，也只留下一座空房，邊疆銀行，建築得最好，最堂皇。</p>
<p>窮入骨子</p>
<p>來延之前，就有人對我羽陜北是出差人的地方，但我到了以後，發現陝北的人民，硬是現在窮到骨頭裏了，住的破房子，穿的千補萬縫的衣服。除了破衣服以外，陝北人却是相當健康。</p>
<p>延安市塲雖然漸次恢復，但那麽多的共軍住舍，機關，該如何分配，似乎我還沒有聽到具體的計劃，現在的問題該是盡力使一切回到正常狀態。「東方的莫斯科」，現代的「梁山泊」，是貧窮雜亂而狹小的。</p>
<p>窰洞乎？大厦乎？</p>
<p>共黨要人，在撤出延安之前，曾居於富麗堂皇之大厦內，度其生活。（上）共黨「中央大會堂」全景。（下）國軍光復延安後，居民紛紛返鄉，對貧苦婦孺一律發放賑款，特設置國軍爲人民服務處，專司賑濟事宜。（軍聞社秉凡攝）</p>

<h3>關於籌組「作協」分會的　一個信念·一種態度</h3>
<p>— 王進珊</p>
<p>三十五年一月二十六日，中華全國文葛作家協會在重慶組織成立的時候，我會經寫過一籍短文。大意是說：</p>
<p>中國的文藝國地本是一片憂草荒原，况且又經過了八年浩刦，要做的事眞太多了。忝爲人類精神技師的作家，正是「任重而道遠」。所以我們誠摯的希望全國作家要先，黨派的團結而團結，全國文藝界要先國家統一而統一。更要以團體的民主統一，作爲全國民主統一的示範；以作家的自重互重，作爲國人自重互重，參政施憲的始基。</p>
<p>這雖是一年多以前的藝話，——那時正是政治協商期間，而今時過境遷，重溫舊作，眞不勝感槪系之。不過我的信念還沒有改變：我始終相信文藝是超政治的，團體不是黨派的尾巴，文藝事業則是全人類的事業。作家除了有他本本國民對國家的權利和義務以外，在寫作上，並不一定會處處表現政黨的狹隘的政治意見。當然，我也不否認現代作家人人都沒有政治色彩，或是說作家個個都不願參加政治活動：不過，那是另外一回事。若是單從一位作家的寫作上說，儘可不必把政治性的宜傳和純文藝的創作混爲一談。</p>
<p>作品的主題，基於作家的思想性格，是作家人生觀和現實生活的反映。但是這和黨派的政治主張，却有廣狹之不同，抽象和具體的分別。嚴格的說，一位作家的責任，就是憑着他的感覺，忠實於他的體騐，把握着他的情感，針對現實，反映人生。魯迅的「阿Q正傳」，茅盾的「子夜」，和曹禺的「蛻變」等，都忠實的盡了這個責任，所以得到廣大的讀者和觀衆。</p>
<p>有人說，文藝事業是一種感情的敎育，我同意。我更相信從我們思想行爲中激起創造力的是感情，使作家的生命和他的作品合而爲一，而放射着暗夜星辰似的光芒的是感情。而作家與作家之間，也就是人與人之間，那靈犀一點，聯　與結合的關鍵，也就是感情。——感情是宇宙最大的神秘。</p>
<p>所以作家團體的組織並不是消極的黨同伐異，而是積極的爲了增進友情的聯緊和互助。</p>
<p>「鳥鳴嚶嚶，求其友聲」，這是物類感情的感應；「以文會友，以友輔仁」，這是文人感情的感應。毫無做作，極其自然。所以一位作家的參加團體組織，只問你是不是忠實於藝術，忠實於你的感覺和體騐，倘若你也並不否認你的熱情，更是熱愛自由寫作的話；那誰也不必問誰的宗敎信仰或政治關係，同樣都是好朋友，（縱使臭味不完全相投，也不一定是仇敵。）大家都可以拉拉手，來向戰後更加荒華的文藝園地，共同加一番耕耘。</p>
<p>世界文化從來沒有一種力量可以遏止它的交流，爲什麽一個國家有限的幾位作家不能融洽在一起？在今年戲劇節我們看到戲劇界的大會串，不但再不分什麽南田北熊，梅派麒派；地方戲和話劇，相聲和歌詠都在一個舞台上演出了。莊周所謂：「涸轍之鮒，相濕以沫，相嚅以氣，」因爲我們還不能相志於江河喲！所以我更相信，這正是中國新文化運動邁進又一個新階段的開始，也是中國文藝復興的曙光。所以在文藝界方面，已經沒有什麼左翼右翼，京派海派；文學硏究會與創造社已早揉合在一起，語絲社和現代社也已天下一家，大家目前所需要的是共同建立一種新的富作信念，創造一種現代中國文藝的新作風。</p>
<p>最近作家協會想在上海組織一　分會，有幾位朋友談到這個問題，有人當然也不免有些顧慮；我說，這種組織事實上是需要的　上海是全國文化中心，也是　　文化交流的　匯；上海作家　　　不但　　全國作家，上海的作家團體也爲中外觀瞻所繫，世界作家所注意。所以我覺得旣然客觀事實上需要一個組織，所要顧　的倒不是與類似性質的團體有沒有衝突的問題，而是龍不能組織一個「眞」的作家自己的團體。因爲一個「眞」的團體是人與人性格的結合，是感情的交流；而且由「眞」才可以完成「善」，才能發揮「美」，——這就是我的信念。</p>
<p>由於這個信念，我更覺得作協分會的組織每位作家都不妨踴躍參加：首先打破過去的領袖觀念，老闆制度，沒有誰包辦，也不讓誰操縱；不受政府津貼，不求社會救濟，有多少力量做多少事。純粹以友情爲黏合劑，以互助爲維繫力，不但不必造一扇大門，連圍牆的界限也不讓它存在；要有界限，也就是整個文藝界的界限。只問是不是作家，是不是居留在這兒的作家，是的，那便應該伸出友情的手表示竭誠的歡迎，歡迎共同來組織一個上海作家自己的團體。——這是我對於這種組織的一種態度。</p>
<p>假如一個　體，除了上面說到的會員之間的感情的聯繫，事業的合作之外，還得有它的現實的目標的話，那麽，這個幽體的目標，我看至多也只是爭取寫作和出版的自由，保障寫作和出版的權利；進而建立現代中國文藝的自由作風，促進現代中國的文藝復興而已。所以和已有的文藝團體不但沒有牴觸，不會磨擦，而且更該希望類似的姊妹團體　續不斷的產生。因爲這並不是黨派組織，也不同於行帮結合，類似的團體本來可以相輔相成，常然也不妨新陳代謝。一位作家儘可以參加兩個以上類似的團體；兩個姊妹團體，打時也不妨聯合舉行各種的活動。這樣，作家才能走在政治前面，自己看重自己的使命，互相尊重我們的任務。這樣，團體才有它的前途，文藝才能成爲人類永垂不朽的共同事業——這又是我的一種看法。</p>
<p>附啓：　中華全一國文藝作家協會上海分會籌備　現有徴求會員登記表若干份，委託本報春秋編輯室代辦徽求會員手續，有意加入者，函索請附回件信封，月底截止。</p>
<h3>紅薇老人畫展</h3>
<p>— 方介堪</p>
<p>丙戌秋日，紅薇老人自渝來滬，適其姨甥鄭子曼靑亦在滬舉行畫展，亟往訪之。老人雖年近古稀，而耳目聰明，精神健强，如四十許人；可謂得天獨厚者矣。老人自謂得靜坐法，有以致之，蓋書實非但可以壽世，且其人得姻露供養，必享大年。世人嘗論書畫重在筆墨當以精神爲主，茍精神不足，則一切無成，　論藝事。余謂筆墨以故人之福壽原薄，亦可於其筆墨中觀之。老人繪事之精，工力之深，海內外早有定評。　者主席蔣公會題「媲美徐黄」四字贈之，藝林傳爲佳話。一載以還，老人昕夕揮毫，好學不倦，所作花卉翎毛草蟲樹石之類，凡百餘幀，大都着軍鈎勒，賦色古艷，栩栩如生。書法秀勁高雅，得褚河南神髓。詩亦淸新冲澹，有宋人韵味，彌足珍已。余謂工筆最難生動，若專事描寫，板灑乏神，一無生氣，爲識者所不取；此中奧竅，全在鈎勒之精與不精；精則生動有神，且其意與，神情往往出於筆墨之外，而靈和渾穆之氣溢於紙上，百續不厭。今老人誠有過之，而無不及，宜乎世人得共寸縑尺楮珍同拱　，非偶然也。茲老人出其近作假中國畫苑展覽，公諸於世，世有知之者，吾知必駢一屆接踵一覩巨製以爲快也。</p>
<h3>風箏——揚州續夢之十四</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>揚州畫舫錄上說：「風箏盛於淸明，其聲在弓，其力在尾。大者方丈，尾長有至二三丈者。式多長方，呼爲板門。餘以螃蟹，蜈蚣，蜻蜓，蝴蝶，福字，壽字爲多，次之陳妙常僧尼會，老跎少，楚霸王。及歡天喜地，天下太平之屬，巧極人工，晚或擊燈於尾，多至連三連五」。證以筆者幼年所見，便多相異之處。說到「風箏盛於淸明」，從來如此，亦各地皆然。若「其聲在弓」，則應視風箏之大小，過小者是沒有弓的，自也無聲可聞。較大者用蒲弓，再大者用籐弓，最大者用竹弓。都是將蒲，籐，和竹子，刮削得極薄，以當弓弦。至於「其力在尾」，幷非所有風箏一概如此。如蜈蚣（揚人稱爲「百脚」）。便不論大小均屬無尾，其他精製之風箏中如螃蟹，蜻蜓，蝴蝶等也都無尾無尾又有獨尾，二尾及三尾之別。小型風箏所用之尾，祗是細瘦錢串，大型者即須用較粗之繩索。其所謂「式多長方，呼爲板門」，板門是指大者，小者則呼爲麵筋泡。麵筋泡之製法極簡，售價極廉，小兒所放之風箏，多屬此種。</p>
<p>風箏之形式，略可分爲大小兩型，小型中除麵筋泡外，多屬精品，所謂「巧極人工」，倒也名製實相符，售價均不賤，尤以小百脚爲最貴。因爲小百脚之好歹，不僅在於紥得漂亮與否，還要注意到全體是否勻稱。如稍不勻稱，放至天空，便將不斷翻身，終於又墮落塵埃。這風箏翻身，在揚人謂之「打招」。小百脚連頭尾約在十數節，要能放到天空夭矯的動淸，却不打招下墮，才是精品。此外螃蟹，蜻蜓，蝴蝶，老鷹，以及美人等，都屬小型一類，且多係精製品。一般小兒放此類風箏者極少，因而就變爲有錢的世家子弟及慘綫少年們之專有品。</p>
<p>大型中除板門外，更有六角，八角，九連燈，大百脚等。小型風箏可用棉綫式絲綫放，而這種大型者便非用麻製之繩索不可，且非一二人所能管制得好。放這類風等者，均係大人，且多爲好勇鬥狠的下層人物。放至天空以後，他們將繼索拴在樹上，便三五成羣的聚在一旁談笑着，鑑賞着。較小的風箏，如或碰到他們繩索上去，總是被纏攪着難於分開，終即變成他們的大風箏之附庸小國，在旁邊飄蕩着了。他們是勝利者，一時會鼓掌嘩笑，而失敗者便祗有懊喪不已。尤其是小兒們，時常爲此噙着眼淚，痴痴的仰望好久以後，才三步兩回頭的離去。偶或遇到難方實力相差不多，便會揎袖攘臂，始則對罵，繼則互毆了。</p>
<p>這許多大型風箏，除了弓外，更帶有鈴子或哨子。弓聲宏放，鈴聲嘹亮，哨聲淸越，一時交響天空，頗可悅耳。至晚多不復收下，且在繩索上添掛若干紅燈。翼航錄上所謂「繫燈於尾」，是李斗誤記，還是今昔異樣，便不可得知。</p>
<p>在昔放大刑風箏的地點，除了城外，城內舊城是大汪邊，新城是康山。自從康山民房漸多，空地日少，大汪邊砌了學校，城內便不易更覓到適當的地點。兼以揚州一天天沒落下去，以經濟論，以情緒論，也都不容許天空中的大型風箏多了起來。從前的揚州，在姻花三月，可以竟日，聽到天空中風箏的響聲，夜晚還可見到許多紅燈。現在却祗感到天空的寂寞襯映着揚州的衰老。</p>
<p>此外須得附帶說及的，大百脚在過去以廣儲門外梅家莊製作的最爲精良。莊上人在農忙之暇就製作百脚，有長至百節以上的。每至春來，在莊前樹上，總是拴着兩三條正是放在天空的大百脚。買的人可以實地選擇，覺得那一條穩健就指定那一條論價。</p>
<p>末了，畫舫錄上又說：「近日新製洋燈，取象風箏，而不用綫。其法用綿紙無瑕穴者長尺四寸，闊尺二寸，槎之減性。綴其　如軗；削竹篾作環如紙大，以紙附之。中交午繫兩銅絲，交處置極薄銅片，周圍上喬作牆，中舖苧麻，麻用高梁酒浸熟者，上舖黄自蠟，硫黄，潮腦，狼糞，以火燃之，令有力者四人持其紙之向上無篾環者，燕藥而升，不縱自上，大如經星，終夜乃落。」這在筆者幼年還有時見之，近年來非但不復再見，且無人談及比物了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血400</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>老人候鶴見的話說完，立刻也吩咐了那小夥子兩句話。小夥子領着正岩去後，老人便把那兩句話譯給鶴見聽；生恐鶴見發生誤會。</p>
<p>「你們同中村小姐是一種什麽關係？」</p>
<p>「中村小姐是一位北平敝同志的朋友。敝同志有電訊來，說明這位小姐，很同情敝團體的運動，因此很想見她一面。」</p>
<p>「你們大槪知道她是日本人？」鶴見冷笑着。</p>
<p>「知道的…可是同情敝團體運動的貴國人，也不在少數呢！」</p>
<p>「你們大槪知道這位中村小姐的職務嗎？」</p>
<p>「只知道她是貴軍部特務機關的有力份子。」老人說得字字沉着。</p>
<p>「那麽你們仍舊信得過？」</p>
<p>「她的行動。對於我們，至少沒有害處！」</p>
<p>「何以見得？」</p>
<p>「我們也有很健全的組織，消息也十分靈通。」</p>
<p>「何以不知這中村小姐今晨已經失踪？」「這件事有點過分出人意表，」老人抬起手來，輕輕拂着那疎疎朗期的一部長髯，現出凝思的神情；「我們上午十一點鐘，才得到這個消息…」</p>
<p>「那麼，貴部下還在公園裏呆等？」鶴見有些批發的意思。</p>
<p>「我們一面希望中村小姐平安無事；一面也想留下這一着，吞看是否會發生更意外的情形；所以沒有撤退公園的人，並且命令他們加緊留意…」</p>
<p>「一共有十餘位：在公園內外？」鶴見要證實他在公園外，上車以前的觀察，有否錯誤。</p>

<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>我幼年時，聽過一個故事；</p>
<p>大槪是淸德宗年間，饑荒外加原有的苛政，使東南幾省人民喘不過氣來，浙東沿海有一千多善良的漁民都被逼迫得去做海盜。朝廷屢次勞師剿「匪」，可惜都不會有結果。這事件居然傳進了「天下之主」的耳朶。那時，有一個聰明的奴才，就是被稱作「爲民父母」的縣太爺，他想了一條好主意；矯稱奉旨招安，保證這一千多人的豐衣足食。這羣所謂海盜，得到了生命的保障自然是欣然來歸，他們都相信這位「朝命父母」能够爲他們造福。</p>
<p>豈知這是「父母官太爺」所虛設的陷阱，一千多顆腦袋在太爺的妙計下搬了家，接着太爺以「機智」知遇，官運亨通；由一縣的「父母」，升爲一府的「父母」，又昇爲……除下了藍頂子，換上了紅頂子。</p>
<p>當時有個有心人，替這火官底紅頂子，題了兩句詩，詩曰：</p>
<p>「可憐多少蒼生血，染得鰲頭一點紅。」</p>
<p>這故事是滿蘊着悲凉之意味的，至今想來，猶覺深刻地印在腦海裏。</p>
<p>冠蓋之下，廟堂之上，正不知有蒼生幾許血淚也。</p>

<h3>凍結與解凍</h3>
<p>— 珏人</p>
<p>春天過去，初夏的天氣又來了。</p>
<p>現在社會上無論什麽事都名實不符，矛盾刺謬的徽象，呈現在人們眼前的，眞是數說不淸，照說，天時人事，應該是配合的，春行夏令，固然是不對，春行冬令，尤其不應該，夏天來了，「蹈春冰，履虎尾」的春天過去了，不應該再有冰，「夏蟲不可以語冰」，古時雖有明言，今日確已有實例，因爲夏天的人造冰太多，雖然是「夏蟲」，也應該可以「語冰」了。（一切是人爲的，固不獨人造冰而已，）</p>
<p>人造冰是冷酷的，不但改變了氣候，也改變了人生，存在外國銀行裏的中國闊老們的雄厚資金，可以不凍結，而國內　水階級的生活指數，却凍結了，自寒冷的天氣凍起，凍到夏天，還不開凍，這自然和「春冰薄人情更薄」無關。</p>
<p>而且在生活指數上凍結了不算事，同時還陳結了一切的生產事業。</p>
<p>某報載景德鎭特約通訊，其大標題云：</p>
<p>「草長鶯飛的季節，景德鎭春窰冰封中。」</p>
<p>原稿中說得好：</p>
<p>「春回大地，東風解凍，這正是一個生氣勃勃的季節。舊歷新年，依照習俗，所謂休業，最多也不過是十天半個月的時間；誰會料得到正月二月三月四月，直到現在，還不見景德鎭有一座瓷憲的烟囱在冒姻哩？……」</p>
<p>爲什麽有此慘象呢？一言以蔽之，春窰也凍結了！</p>
<p>窰業如此，其他大多數的工業，也莫不在凍結中。若說這一切凍結的原因，是因爲過去有冰由之故，當然也有理由。</p>
<p>通鑑唐紀天寰十一年，陝郡進士張暴對人說：「君輩倚楊右相如泰由，吾以爲冰由耳，若皎日旣出，君輩得無失所恃乎？」</p>
<p>顯然的，這座冰山在今日已經被皎日融化了，應該一切都可以解凍，無論是生活，無論是生產。可是在事實上，都不見解凍的徴象，難道皎日還沒有出來嗎？我們不能不爲之深有所憂。</p>

<p>國內消息不好，我們在國外很受人家輕視。就談目前，新　有問題，台灣暴動，旅大猶沒有接收，湘西災荒，眞令人傷透腦筋。現在英國站在盟友的立塲上，正在募捐救濟我國湘西災民，到處貼標語，且各影院均將湘西災况演出，以備激起一般英人的同情。其實，這又那裏令人家忍心去看哩？</p>
<p>現在，我們均不敢上岸去—每日髁餘，可乘小輪上街遊覽。當我們在街道上行走時，許多男女老少的人們，用手指着我們，紛紛議論中國的事。有時，甚至攔住我們，問了許多敎人一時難以回答的問題。所以，同學們即使閒得無聊，也只好悶在家裏。我們現在正發起募捐運動，爲期還不到三天，總計已有千餘鎊了。現在正討論如何匯回祖國去，使其中無人揩油，而能直接到達難民手中。</p>

<h3>李文忠—死得其時</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>甲午以後，文忠雖不爲北洋大臣，仍居文華殿大學士相位，旋又命爲總理各國事務大臣，總理衙門體制，亦以親王領銜，與軍機處相仿，合肥老氣横秋，往往獨持已見，雖首座亦無如之何。故翁松輪日記中，時有諷刺之語，而中朝廟議，　有時秘不使知，（軍機大臣，每日必召對，總署則不爾）可笑也。</p>
<p>合肥相度雍容，對東朝從無一怨望語，所論者，每謂會相逝世太平，同列有世界眼光者太少，中興後，非但不能有所建設，以視各國之動精圖治，爭加戰備者，相差太遠，將來外交。以國弱更難措手，不勝扼腕。</p>
<p>戊戌，合肥出任兩廣　督，故庚子難作，能與劉張兩督，同保東南大局，合肥實大有造於淸室也。倘庚子合肥仍在北京，必將與徐許諸公，同遭駢戮；故合肥若死於甲午以前。直督任所，則衆論龐雜，心跡難明，若死於日本一彈，則更輕於鴻毛；即不然，死於賢良寺投閒置散之時，則蓋精論定，亦不知奚若，惟至聯軍入都，兩寓西狩，再入都主持和議，竭其鞠躬盡瘁之心，以延有淸十年壽命，而一片忠於爲國之心，乃大白於天下，焉得不謂之死得其時乎？</p>
<h3>貴賓救火</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>紐約某太飯店最近失火，某時正有荷蘭前外交家邱林男爵夫婦款待貴賓，於是與會來賓，以及其他各樓住客，都揮動手提滅火器，敷設水龍管，協助施救。那位不愛江出愛美人的英國遜王溫莎公爵，亦在其內，這些貴賓並不過分愛惜他們寳貴的生命，竟能冒着萬險，與火神搏鬥，實在是値得我們欽敬的。</p>
<p>在火災爆發之初，救火員尙未赶到以前，這短短的一刹那間，乃是最最重要的關頭，此時在塲的人果能奮勇施救，其效果實遠大於火勢蔓延，以後救火員所能做的工作，貴賓們救火之所以可貴而並非僅是一種名票客串的姿態，實在於此。</p>
<p>然而貴賓們屈尊救火，其本才總還是値得一提的。通訊社之所以特別指出者，當然也是這一種心理。於此我們不難看出，溫莎公爵之不愛江山，原來就出於他的那稱講求實際的個性，他可以爲了女人而敞展王位，也可以爲了救火而甘冒生命危險。這種奮勇向前，義無反顧的精神，委實不是供人嘲笑的資料。</p>
<p>倘然我們把這件事（貴賓救火）仔細想想，却又覺得其中另外還有一個道理可說，試想在這種情勢之下，如果換了我們中國的貴賓，大概不過吵吵嚷嚷，狼奔豕突的一陣子吧。可是這並不足以說明我們中國貴賓祗右隔岸觀火的劣根性，沒有當仁不讓的勇氣，我說中國貴賓以及一般中國老百姓，都是同外國人一樣具有惻穩之心的。他們決不願見火不　。所以不救者，他們的力量不够而已。因爲我們的貴賓以及一般老百姓，很少有此種需要胆識與體力的訓練。他們一生就是攏着袖子過了來的。你呌他們怎樣能在這種時候奮勇救火呢？外國貴賓能冒險救火而並不遇險，換了我們中國人，恐怕就要因此而送了性命。說到遠裏，就要扯到我們整個敎育，和社會風氣的問題了。我們至今還是一個斯文的國家。</p>

<p>「緋緋！緋緋！」蘭也立刻着急起來。</p>
<p>他們的力量稍一分散，脚底下便立刻被　撞得動搖起來了；老黄和阿李咬緊牙齒，用前部拼命的往外撑，也顯得有些抵擋不住。</p>
<p>老祝瞧情形不對，忙把原在手裏提的一口小皮箱授給蘭，同時搶過榮兒，抱在左手裏；一面又用右手提起了緋料，立刻向其餘的人發令：</p>
<p>「退回去！不能上了！」</p>
<p>但退回去也眞不容易，他們五個大人差不多使盡了混身所有的力氣，才能衝出重圍，退到空曠的田野中。榮兒爲過度的驚駭所製，只緊抱了那頭銅製的兔子爸爸發抖；緋緋的檢色稍微好轉了一些，但　眼還是發直，像失去了知覺一樣。</p>
<p>蘭扔下手裏的皮箱，筋疲力竭地倒在地上。</p>

<h3>The National Government Reorganization Has Been Completed; Chairman Chiang Explains Three Key Points; Still Hopes the CCP Will Change Its Rebellious Attitude</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The National Government celebrated the 20th anniversary of establishing its capital in Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 18th. Chairman Chiang attended and delivered a speech, stating that: The National Government has been based in Nanjing for 20 years, but the Three Principles of the People have not yet been fully realized, and the national economy and people's livelihood have not yet been stabilized. Government colleagues feel deeply ashamed. However, the internal and external troubles that the country has encountered in the past 20 years, and the dangerous and difficult situations, are unprecedented in history. Fortunately, the National Government, with the support of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit and the united efforts of all colleagues, has been able to overcome all difficulties and lay the foundation for national construction, which is truly gratifying. Now that the reorganization of this government has been completed, it is the initial realization of our party's ideal of returning power to the people. In the future, the government should move towards democratic constitutionalism. It is hoped that all comrades will maintain their past spirit, work together with one heart and one mind, and strive to complete the mission of implementing the Three Principles of the People and building a new China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The completion of the National Government's reorganization coincided with the 20th anniversary of the National Government's establishment in Nanjing (18th). Chairman Chiang specifically received Chinese and foreign reporters in the National Government Auditorium at 11:05 AM on this day and delivered a speech. This was the first press conference held by the Chairman in the capital since the victorious relocation. When Chairman Chiang arrived at the auditorium, he was wearing a khaki military uniform, with the Blue Sky White Sun Medal on his chest, and frequently showed a smile, seemingly indicating the infinite joy in his heart. Wu Tingchang, Peng Xuepei, Li Weiguo, Shen Changhuan, Cao Shengfen, and others were present, and more than a dozen Chinese and foreign reporters attended.</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang exchanged greetings with the reporters, he said: Today is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, so I have specifically invited reporters in Nanjing to talk. Today is also the day of the National Government's reorganization. The order has already been issued, and everyone has probably seen it. This reorganization of the National Government is a new stage in the history of the Chinese revolution, and its importance lies in three points: First, in this reorganization of the National Government, all major parties except the Kuomintang have participated. The multi-party government that has been expected for years has now been realized. The establishment of this multi-party government is the first step for the Kuomintang to return power to the people. From now on, we will enter a period of constitutional democracy, and from this, we can further expedite the completion of the goal of unification and peace. Second, we must realize the return of power to the people and implement democratic constitutionalism, and we cannot wait until the end of the Communist Party's armed rebellion. At the same time, we hope that the Communist Party's armed rebellion will end as soon as possible, disarm, and no longer cause chaos, so that they have the opportunity to participate in the government and achieve unification. Third, for more than a year, the Communist Party has repeatedly claimed that the Kuomintang has no sincerity in returning power to the people. This reorganization shows that what the Communist Party said is incorrect. At the same time, not waiting for the end of the Communist Party's rebellion before implementing the reorganization indicates the Kuomintang's determination to realize it. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] On the 18th, the day of the 20th anniversary of the National Government's establishment in the capital and the reorganization of the National Government Committee, Chairman Chiang of the National Government specifically received the press at the National Government Auditorium at 11:05 AM in the morning. More than 20 Chinese and foreign reporters attended, and Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang and Minister Peng Xuepei also attended the meeting. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech on the spot, which was translated by Secretary Shen Changhuan. The original text of his speech is as follows: Today's reorganization of the National Government Committee is an important step in our country's transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism. This reorganization allows all political parties and social elites to participate in the nation's highest political decision-making body. After the reorganization, the distribution of National Government Committee members is as follows: Kuomintang 12 seats, Democratic Socialist Party 4 seats, Youth Party 4 seats, Social Elites 4 seats, and the heads of the five Yuan are ex officio members (5 seats). Currently, the heads of the five Yuan are still Kuomintang members, so the Kuomintang occupies a total of 17 seats. When members of other political parties or social elites serve as heads of the Yuan, the number of seats occupied by the Kuomintang will naturally decrease. The original quota for National Government Committee members was 40, and the original quota for Kuomintang members was 20. Now, only 29 names have been announced. If the remaining 11 seats are filled, the number of Kuomintang members will be 17 out of 40 seats, which is still less than half of the total number of seats. The selection of candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party for this reorganization of the government was determined by the two parties themselves. The selection of participating candidates from social elites was done with the consent of the individuals themselves. After the participation of various political parties in the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, followed by the expansion of the scope of the National Government Committee, a multi-party government has now been completed. Furthermore, when the reorganization of the Executive Yuan is completed, under the new Premier, the heads of various ministries and commissions will also be separately appointed by political parties and social elites. In the past, the power of our country's government was the responsibility of the Kuomintang. After this reorganization, it will be jointly exercised by the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites. The National Government Committee will exercise its powers during this transitional period and implement the resolutions of the National Assembly to complete the preparations for the implementation of the constitution, which will begin on December 25th of this year. After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's political situation can be divided into two stages. The first stage was to persuade the CCP to participate in the government through American mediation and to incorporate its army into the national army. The second stage began with the convocation of the National Assembly. The participation of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites in the National Assembly and the joint formulation of the constitution show that the people of the whole country are enthusiastically supporting the government's efforts to implement constitutionalism. At a time when the world situation is constantly evolving, our country's need for peace and construction is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the unification of the country must be realized in the shortest possible time. Democracy and constitutionalism cannot be indefinitely delayed while waiting for the CCP. If the CCP abandons its actions of seizing power by force and can cooperate for the sake of national unity and unification, then the party still has the opportunity to participate in the government and engage in national construction work. For the sake of alleviating the suffering of our compatriots, we sincerely hope that the CCP can finally change its rebellious attitude.</p>
<p>Speech by Chief Secretary Wu of the National Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Chief Secretary Wu of the National Government recently made the following statement: The significance of the National Government's reorganization lies in expanding the foundation of the government, transitioning from a government responsible by one party to a government jointly responsible by multiple parties. Chairman Chiang's remarks to reporters today have provided a detailed and clear explanation. Regarding Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law, which states that "The Chairman of the National Government is responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang," the word "responsible" is based on the provisions of Article 10, which states that "The Chairman of the National Government is elected by the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang." This is because, in terms of the Chairman's own position, he cannot but be responsible to the organization that produced him. It does not mean that the resolutions of the National Government Committee must be decided by the Chinese Kuomintang. The National Government Committee is "the highest state affairs organ," which is clearly stipulated in the Organization Law.</p>
<h3>New National Government Committee Members to Take Oath of Office on a Scheduled Date; First Meeting to Be Held After the Inauguration Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The new National Government Committee members are scheduled to take their oath of office on the 23rd. The National Government Committee will hold its first meeting after the inauguration ceremony.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] A letter signed by Zhang Junmai and Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party was brought to Nanjing from Shanghai by Yang Junmin on the night of the 17th and handed over to Jiang Yuntian. According to Jiang, the content only concerned the situation of the party in Shanghai. Although Xu still firmly declined the appointment, Jiang expressed that Xu has foresight and great ambition, and it is very appropriate for him to serve as a government committee member, so he will still be invited to accept the appointment. As for the internal problems of the party, he still advocates strict sanctions against Sun Baogang and others.</p>
<h3>Xu Fulin Going to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party, in response to Chairman Chiang's telegram invitation, is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight. Xu told reporters yesterday that Wu Xianzi wrote in a letter a few days ago that his illness has not yet recovered and that he will not be able to come to Shanghai for two weeks. As for the vacancy for a Democratic Socialist Party government committee member, it will still be nominated by Zhang Junmai and then passed by the party's Central Standing Committee. Regarding the party's internal disputes, he believes that they are purely emotional and that Zhang Junmai does not attach importance to them. A few days ago, Tang Xiangming and others, under the guise of nine members of the Central Standing Committee, opposed Zhang Junmai. Among them, Wu Xianzi and Li Daming were not in Shanghai, Liang Qiushui was not a member of the Central Standing Committee, and Zhang Dongzheng had already left the party. Therefore, in reality, only five people participated in the matter. It is a joke for five people to launch a "party purge."

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Economic Policy Committee held a regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th, attended by Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, He Zhonghan, Lou Tongseng, and others. Chen Lifu chaired the meeting. The meeting discussed in detail how to rescue the current crisis in the textile industry. According to reports, there are two major crises facing our textile industry: (1) There is a possibility that Japanese textiles may stage a comeback and dominate the East Asian market again; (2) After the foreign exchange adjustment, the cost of cotton has increased several times, and due to the ban on exports, the future of the textile industry is precarious. The meeting resolved: (1) Since the cost of using foreign cotton is too high, it was decided to formulate a production increase plan so that domestic cotton can be self-sufficient. (2) The production of Japanese cotton should be standardized so that it can be fully used for self-consumption. If there is a surplus, it should be purchased by China. This matter will be negotiated with General MacArthur's headquarters through diplomatic channels. (3) Promote frugality and transport as much exportable cotton yarn as possible to Southeast Asia to replace the original Japanese market. (4) Increase the import tariff rate on cotton fabrics.</p>

<h3>Regulations for the Organization of the News Bureau Revised and Approved by the Legislative Yuan; Regulations for Military Personnel Voting Also Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Legislative Yuan continued its 322nd regular meeting on the morning of the 18th to discuss important cases such as the Regulations for the Organization of the News Bureau. Sun Fo chaired the meeting. When he stepped into the meeting hall, everyone applauded warmly to congratulate him on his appointment as Vice Chairman of the National Government. The discussion began immediately. The first item proposed was the proposal to add Article 3 to the Executive Yuan Organization Law. It was resolved to add the following article after Article 2: "The Executive Yuan shall establish a News Bureau, the organization of which shall be determined by law." Then, the Regulations for the Organization of the News Bureau were discussed. First, President Sun explained, pointing out the differences between the News Bureau and the Central Propaganda Department. The News Bureau is subordinate to the Executive Yuan and is a government agency responsible for conveying government orders and achievements, clarifying national policies, and issuing important news, while the Central Propaganda Department is only a party organization that emphasizes party propaganda. The full text of the Organizational Regulations has 14 articles. The main revision today was to change the appointment of the Director from specially appointed to specially designated. There were no other major changes. The discussion lasted about half an hour, and it was revised and passed. Next, the Regulations for the Implementation of the National Assembly Election, Recall, and Initiative Law, which has 71 articles in its full text, was also successfully revised and passed. Among the articles, the provisions on military personnel voting and election expenses are more noteworthy. Regarding the military personnel voting regulations, it is stipulated that those serving in the military and possessing the right to vote should register as voters with the election authority of their place of origin. If they cannot return to their place of origin to participate in voting, they may vote for candidates announced for their place of origin at their military location. Regarding election expenses, there are detailed provisions in British and American laws. When the Legislative Yuan previously discussed the ten major laws of constitutionalism, Legislative Members Chen Ruxuan and others also solemnly proposed it. Due to factual reasons, this regulation only makes negative provisions. Another issue that caused controversy was how to interpret the "border ethnic groups" mentioned in this regulation. Rui Yifu suggested expanding its scope to include border residents in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places, in addition to the southwestern border ethnic groups in Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces. Liu Butong and others disagreed, and it was resolved to maintain the original plan. Regarding the Organizational Regulations of the National Government Design and Evaluation Department, it was decided to hand it over to the Legal System and Economic Committees for re-examination. The meeting adjourned at about 12 o'clock. The next regular meeting is scheduled to be held on the 24th. The draft Banking Law is expected to complete its second reading and be passed at that meeting.</p>

President Sun immediately agreed to forward the request.</p>
<h3>National Army Reinforcements Provide Strong Support, Flowing Continuously from Shaanxi and Henan into Shanxi, Remaining Communist Bandits on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Encircled on All Sides</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Taiyuan, 18th] Strong reinforcements of the National Army arrived in Yuncheng, Anyi, and Linjin on the 16th. Another force crossed the river from Dingchuan and advanced to Jixian in western Shanxi. A force of 60,000 Communists launched an offensive from southern Shanxi, capturing nine county towns in the past two weeks. Apart from Yishi, which has been retaken by the National Army, Yicheng, Fushan, Jiangxian, Jishan, Xinjiang, Hejin, Ronghe, and Wanquan remain occupied. Now, National Army reinforcements are continuously entering Shanxi from Shaanxi and Henan, determined to annihilate the Communist forces completely.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The situation in southwestern Shanxi is very tense. Yishi is currently under siege by 300 troops. The situation is unclear. The National Army in Anyi is breaking through the Communist defenses to provide assistance.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] After merging, the Communists in Quwo and Xinjiang moved north, attacking Fenyang and Xiangling. Using cavalry, they moved north along the Fen River, besieging Xiangling and Fencheng, where fighting is fierce.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] The natural defenses of the Yellow River, such as Dongyumen Ferry, Hejin, and Longmen, are all in the hands of the National Army. Another Communist force is reinforcing north of Jishan. The Communists' flank detachment crossed Quanpo and fled towards Puxian. The National Army is on high alert in Linfen and Hongdong.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 18th] The Communist forces in the so-called Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are under simultaneous attack by the National Army from eastern Gansu, southern Ningxia, and southern Suiyuan, following the campaign in northern Shaanxi, and have now been completely encircled. The Communist forces trapped in the gourd-shaped encirclement have had their outlet closed due to the convergence of the National Army from the east and west. Since the beginning of this ten-day period, the National Army in eastern Gansu retook Qingyang on the 8th, Huanxian on the 11th, and Quxiqian between Qingyang and Huanxian. The National Army in southern Ningxia retook Anbianbao on the 8th, Ningtiaoliangzhen on the 10th, and Jingbian on the 13th, joining forces with the National Army in northern Shaanxi. The National Army in southern Suiyuan is advancing south from Yulin and engaging in fierce fighting with the Communist forces in the mountainous area north of Mizhi. The National Army in northern Shaanxi is attacking Suide on one hand and crossing the river to intercept and suppress the remnants of Chen Geng's forces who attacked southern Shanxi on the other. Currently, the Communist forces in the border region number about seven brigades, with Wang Zhen as the commander of the southern route, Wang Shitai as the commander of the northern route, and He Long as the overall commander. However, due to the encirclement by the National Army on all sides, they have suffered heavy losses and their main force has been broken up. It appears they will disperse and go underground in various areas to carry out guerrilla warfare. Their main force may abandon northern Shaanxi and flee into northern Shanxi. It is expected that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which the Communists have occupied for twelve years, can be cleared in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 18th] In recent days, there have only been localized engagements in the mountainous areas of southern Shandong. There has also been no intense fighting on the Jiaoji Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 18th] After eliminating Communist resistance, Wang Yaowu's forces, which were sweeping southeast from Jinan, recovered Zhonggongzhen, 25 kilometers southeast of eastern Jinan, on the afternoon of the 17th and are continuing to sweep towards Xiying.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 18th] The Communist forces in southern Shandong have deployed two newly formed columns and some local forces to hinder the advance of the National Army pressing towards the Yimeng Mountains along the Jiaozhou-Qingdao and Tianjin-Pukou lines.

<h3>Opening of Private Trade with Japan Opposed by China and the Philippines, Notes Verbale Submitted to the Far Eastern Commission</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] China and the Philippines are opposing the United States' reopening of private trade with Japan. The two countries have submitted notes verbale to the Allied International Trade Bureau of the Far Eastern Commission, stating that the opening of private trade with Japan would hinder the payment of reparations and therefore expressing their opposition. The Trade Bureau had asked member states when private trade with Japan could be opened. The Philippines responded that private trade should be postponed until the proper allocation of reparations is ensured. China also expressed the same view, fearing that after Japan's production increases sharply in the future, Japan will use this as an excuse to demand the withholding of equipment and tools currently designated for reparations. Other Allied countries did not express their opinions, but it is said that they are not enthusiastic about the US proposal. Although these countries agree in principle that Japan's economy must be restored and become self-sufficient, they must first ensure that their individual interests are not affected before private trade with Japan and related matters can be implemented. China and the Philippines also believe that Japan's currency is not stable enough to allow for free trade.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Materials to be Collected at Ports Awaiting Shipment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] According to authoritative sources, General MacArthur has now been authorized to move 30% of the temporary reparations goods to Japanese ports for shipment to the various recipient countries. However, because the Allied Headquarters has not yet allocated these goods, and the transportation of equipment for reparations involves the issue of wood for packing materials and Japan's limited transportation capacity, the shipment of large quantities of reparations goods will take China more than two years.</p>

(3) Compensation - individual violations should be the responsibility of the individual, but the Ministry of Education will respect the representatives' request. As for the restoration of the newspaper offices, he will consult with the Central Propaganda Department for assistance.

In addition, they have obtained passes from the National Army.</p>
<h3>Huo Baoshu Reports to Reporters on the Inspection of the Yellow River Flood Area, Disaster Victims Desperately Need Help, Hope for Cooperation from Various Agencies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), inspected the disaster situation in the Yellow River flood area with representatives from all walks of life in China and abroad a week ago. He and eight members of the UNRRA staff returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. He met with reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the inspection and the relief and rehabilitation plan. According to Huo, the most important issues in rehabilitating the flood area are agriculture and water conservancy. The plan is to restore the flood area to its pre-war state in three years and improve production so that all available land can be cultivated. However, it is currently necessary to provide relief to the disaster victims. At a minimum, they must be allowed to "live".</p>
<p>Huo continued, "The rehabilitation work is more difficult than previously thought. Since the Yellow River changed its course eight years ago, it has brought the Yellow River to the flood area. If cultivation is delayed for another year or so, the soil there will change and become barren. Therefore, it is urgent to transport seeds within six weeks, before the rainy season, to prepare for planting."</p>
<p>"As for refugees returning to their hometowns in the Henan area, an average of about 2,000 people return every day. However, after returning home, they are empty-handed, and food, clothing, and shelter are all problems. Although CRRRA and UNRRA are trying their best to provide relief, there are too many monks and not enough porridge. They are overwhelmed by the sudden influx of people and cannot take care of them. Therefore, we urgently hope that other agencies in various places can cooperate and not allow all the refugees to return at the same time. We hope that those who can produce will return first and start work, and those who consume will be allowed to return later. However, in terms of human sentiment, it is not convenient to separate the old, weak, women, and children, so we also feel difficult about this issue."</p>
<p>CRRRA has now prepared 20,000 tons of grain to provide relief to refugees and is transporting it to the area in succession. Some of it has already arrived. The government has approved a disaster relief and rehabilitation fund of 140 billion yuan for this year. UNRRA will provide materials and equipment worth approximately US$12 million for this year.</p>
<p>Huo also said that the Yellow River flood problem can be called one of the largest relief efforts in the world. He hopes that people from all countries can provide assistance. Based on the inherent strength and perseverance of the Chinese people, he believes that after initially providing material assistance, they can automatically work hard to produce.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 18th] Zheng Daoru and other members of the Joint Inspection Group of the Yellow River Flood Area inspected the Huai River dyke and flood area on the morning of the 18th. At noon, they visited the teaching and dining station and factory in Huaiyuan, and left Bengbu for Beiping in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Burma Sends Representative to Xiamen to Assist Overseas Chinese in Returning</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Fuzhou, 18th] The Burmese government has sent a representative, U Gu Gawe, to Xiamen to assist overseas Chinese in returning. U Gu Gawe arrived in Xiamen on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Bandits Rob Train at Shamian Station on Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Guangzhou, 18th] At 5:00 PM on the 16th, the No. 88 slow train from Kowloon to Guangzhou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was suddenly attacked by more than 1,000 villagers and bandits holding long and short guns, light and heavy machine guns, and sledgehammers at Shamian Station. The military police on board immediately returned fire. A group of rioters swarmed onto the train, looting passengers' property, causing chaos. Passengers cried for help. Under the cover of concentrated fire from the military police, the train desperately started and managed to break through. However, the losses are estimated to be more than hundreds of millions of yuan. This incident is different from general train robberies. Because villagers participated in it, it is generally observed that this may be due to grudges between the local villagers and the railway bureau. The railway bureau has sent personnel to investigate.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of China's Banking Industry</h3>
<p>The Joint Conference of the Bankers' Association of the Republic of China, which began on the 15th of this month in Nanjing, concluded yesterday. For these few days, the leaders of the national banking and financial circles gathered in the capital, truly a grand occasion. The foundation of China's financial economy is inherently weak. After a long period of resistance against Japan, the original foundation has been shaken. Coupled with the decline of the general national economy, the hope for reconstruction and nation-building rests heavily on the banking and financial sector. Therefore, when the National Bankers' Association convened in the capital, our Chairman, despite being burdened with numerous daily tasks, specifically issued instructions for encouragement. In the Chairman's instructions, he placed particularly earnest expectations on the banking and financial industry in the great task of reconstruction and nation-building, saying, "What is hoped for in the future is that the financial sector should work together to further balance the national budget, consolidate the currency system, and establish a firm foundation; strive to stabilize people's livelihoods, increase production, and promote construction; and hope to broadly express insightful opinions and gather wisdom to fulfill the mission that the financial sector should shoulder for nation-building." Over these past few days, the National Bankers' Association meeting in Nanjing has indeed been able to understand the Chairman's good intentions and has discussed in detail the various aspects that the banking industry should adopt and reform in the future. Judging from the numerous and wide-ranging resolutions passed, it is evident that the convening of this National Bankers' Association will have a significant impact on the future development of China's banking industry.</p>
<p>In summary, the resolutions passed by this National Bankers' Association, those that are more important or involve the interests of the general public, are roughly as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of increased payment for pre-war deposits, the resolution has four points: (a) Pre-war savings deposits will still be calculated with compound interest at the original amount, (b) Please ask the government to promptly determine handling methods, (c) Before the government announces handling methods, the government should order national judicial organs to stop accepting lawsuits related to this matter, (d) Organize a petition delegation to petition the government; (2) Implement banking specialization; (3) Change current policies and strengthen the effectiveness of national banks, especially focusing on the Central Bank. There are files from Chongqing, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Shenyang, Beiping, Qingdao, Hankou, Xi'an, and other places requesting to strengthen the connection between the Central Bank and commercial banks to realize its mission as the bank of banks; (4) Simplify reporting procedures and standardize inspection agencies. It can be seen that the discussions at this National Bankers' Association not only concerned matters related to the banking industry itself but also involved major plans related to national governance. Regarding some current problems in the banking and financial sector, standing from the people's perspective, we would like to briefly express our views:</p>
<p>First, regarding the issue of payment of pre-war deposits, this is more of a national problem than a banking problem. Commercial banks, when accepting deposits before the war, did not anticipate such a drastic change in the value of the currency in the contract between the bank and the depositors. Strictly speaking, the payment of pre-war deposits should not be a problem for the bank. That is, however much was deposited before the war, plus the specified interest, should be paid. The bank cannot be held responsible for currency fluctuations, which are beyond its control. Recent court rulings requiring banks to pay a thousand times the original amount have no legal basis and are not consistent with legal principles. However, the sharp depreciation of the currency is a fact, and if the principal and interest were paid according to the original figures, this would naturally be a huge loss for the depositors. Moreover, in the process of currency depreciation, various banks may have used depositors' funds to obtain windfall profits. Therefore, for this issue, we must consider the facts on the one hand and the law on the other. The court's precedent of paying a thousand times the original amount is inappropriate, and the resolution passed by this Bankers' Association to calculate compound interest at the original amount does not take the facts into account. We agree that the government should promptly determine a method to follow. The relationship between a bank and a depositor is a private one, different from the relationship between a bondholder and the state. Therefore, the handling of this matter should not necessarily be the same as that of government bonds. We urge the government to promptly clarify the method for handling this private relationship and, in determining the method, not to ignore the fact of windfall profits gained by taking advantage of the currency crash.</p>
<p>Second, many banks and financial institutions in various regions have proposed business suggestions regarding the Central Bank. This indicates two points: first, the general expectation of banks and financial institutions in various regions for the Central Bank; second, the deep disappointment of the Central Bank with banks and financial institutions in various regions. From these proposals, they either hope that the Central Bank can truly become the bank of banks or that the Central Bank can strengthen its connection with commercial banks. Both of these indicate that the Central Bank has not yet become the bank of banks, and its connection with commercial banks is not close enough, hence such calls. The Central Bank's role was once demonstrated during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army and the pacification of the Central Plains, and again during the establishment of the legal currency system. In recent times, the Central Bank's achievements seem to be more passive than active. During the War of Resistance, either due to special circumstances or complex institutions, the Central Bank was hindered from playing its unique role. The current situation is different from that during the war. Wartime setups that should be abolished should be abolished to avoid affecting the unique functions of the national banks. A more prominent one of these wartime setups is the so-called Four Banks Joint Office. This may have been necessary during the war, but whether it should be allowed to continue to exist at present seems worthy of consideration. The existence of this institution may have some impact on the Central Bank's ability to fulfill its role as the bank of banks. Since banks and financial institutions in various regions have high expectations for the Central Bank, this point also seems worthy of study.</p>
<p>As for banking specialization, this is something that should have been done long ago. The term "banking specialization" refers not only to national banks but also to commercial banks. National banks should be specialized, and commercial banks should also be specialized. Today's commercial banks are named after industry, agriculture, or mining, and each originally had its own specialization according to its name, but how many of them truly live up to their names? The National Bankers' Association is an organization of commercial banks, and since it has called for banking specialization at its inaugural conference, we hope they can start with themselves.</p>
<p>The modern banking industry operated by Chinese people is still less than sixty years old. Although the history of banking in China is short, its contribution to China's modernization is significant. However, as for the banking and financial industry itself, its impact on the modernization of the general public's lives seems insufficient. The situation today is not too different from that sixty years ago. Beijing and Shanghai are densely populated, but financial transactions between the two places still rely on remittances. Compared to other countries where a single check can be used throughout the country, we seem to be in the feudal era of the Middle Ages. Although the banking industry in China is a newly emerging modern enterprise, it is still full of outdated medieval systems. How to modernize China is a responsibility that the banking industry cannot shirk. To modernize China, it is especially hoped that the banking industry itself can modernize. Now that the national banking industry has the organization of the Bankers' Association, we hope they can move in this direction.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Guling: Over a Thousand Households Burned</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 18th] A devastating fire occurred in Guling this summer. On the evening of the 16th, a fire accidentally started in house number 41 on Hou Street in Guling, igniting the wooden walls. The fire spread from Hou Street to Xia Street, Xin Road, and Zheng Street, eventually affecting over a thousand shops and houses, including the Yan Ren Ji Hotel on both streets, completely destroying everything. Over 2,500 people were affected, with losses estimated at around 20 billion [currency unspecified]. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Wang Lingji, after arriving in Shanghai from Hankou, went to Guling on the 18th to oversee relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Disregarding Our Country's Request: Siam Restricts Overseas Chinese Entry; Immigration Law to Take Effect Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th] It has just been learned from authoritative sources that the Siamese immigration regulations will take effect on May 1st. These regulations were originally scheduled to take effect on April 1st but were temporarily suspended due to Ambassador Li Tieh-tseng's suggestions. The number of Chinese allowed to enter (10,000 per year) is based on statistics of the number of Chinese who went to Siam in the past 20 years, which is quite unfair because, between 1937 and 1945, China was isolated from the outside world due to the Japanese blockade. Only 18,000 Chinese people went to Siam. China has strongly argued that a reasonable and fair number should be stipulated for Chinese going to Siam. Therefore, the sudden withdrawal of this new regulation will cause difficulties for those already en route or preparing to come here. Therefore, the Chinese authorities have requested that these regulations be postponed until May 1st. It is understood that China's request has been rejected. Siam's excuse is that since the resumption of transportation between China and Siam in the middle of last year, an average of 10,000 Chinese people have entered the border each month, many of whom have brought cholera and other infectious diseases. In view of this situation, the Siamese government and people have decided to formulate regulations to restrict the entry of large numbers of Chinese.</p>
<h3>Folk Impressions of Northern Jiangsu (V): On the Matter of "Surrender and Renewal"</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>The original intention regarding "surrender and renewal" was also out of the government's leniency and not pursuing past offenses. Commander Li said: "Because most of the people in the bandit areas were forced into it and had no choice, that's why there is the motivation to handle surrender and renewal. But after this matter was implemented in various places, those handling it often didn't understand the reason and were perfunctory, so sometimes it caused trouble instead. For example, the battle of Sanyu Town was because the 'surrender and renewal' people took advantage of this opportunity to act as insiders, causing Sanyu Town to suffer a great loss."</p>
<p>When the reporter was in Haimen, I once received a letter signed "Haimen Refugee," which mentioned the matter of surrender and renewal, writing in the original text: "Using leniency as a policy to handle surrender and renewal, starting to feel and train, not only is there no effect, but they are also protected, becoming more and more reckless, supplying intelligence to the bandits, and if they have the opportunity, they try to resist, causing great losses, while the lower-level bandit cadres in the area, believing that the central government's policies are lenient, become bolder and more ruthless, the transport of supplies is even more rampant, the killings are even more numerous, without any fear, so there is no hope for suppressing bandits."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the above paragraph of Commander Li's speech was indeed spoken with emotion.</p>
<p>We once visited the "Feeling and Training Center" in Tangjia Gate. This belongs to the "First Brigade of Youth Guidance," including 209 defectors, 194 renewed, and 954 captured people. Among these 1,357 members, there are also six women.</p>
<p>Here, at the invitation of the headquarters, we were given the opportunity to chat with these renewed people. When I stepped into the gate of the Feeling and Training Center, the first feeling was: they are all receiving highly disciplined military training.</p>
<p>A rural farmer who used to be a "militiaman" spoke to me, his mouth full of new terms such as "land reform," "liquidation," and "confession." His dull-witted demeanor, coupled with that set of things in his mouth, I almost laughed out loud, suspecting that I was watching a "puppet show." I asked him if he was literate, and he said very straightforwardly, "I am illiterate!"</p>
<p>Jia Yu, who used to be a female clerk at the "Huazhong Bank," I asked her how she came here? According to her own claim: she was originally a student at Rufou Girls' Middle School. When the New Fourth Army came, she worked as a female clerk at the Huazhong Bank. Later, Rufou was recovered, and she also renewed herself. She was wearing a set of cotton military uniforms that day, and she was chubby. Perhaps because our group of sudden reporters asked too urgently, she looked very nervous, her face flushed red, and she kept stroking herself with both hands.</p>
<p>He speaks with a slight stutter. Regarding his education, he said that after finishing three years at Fudan University, he later went to Chengdu Sichuan University because of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>We asked her what her views were on the Communist Party? Her reply was: "I don't do political work, I'm just a bank clerk counting money!"</p>
<p>Later, when everyone started talking about everyday matters, she said, "My father and brother still live in the countryside thirty miles away from Rufou, and my father is still the current village chief!" She also said, "I was only sent here after renewing myself, and it's been almost two months now."</p>
<p>I asked her if she was living well here? She nodded, not denying it. We asked her again if her family knew about this situation? She said that she could communicate, but it had to be checked.</p>
<p>Finally, we also met Yang Tianhua, the "County Magistrate of Gaoyou County." Because he wasn't feeling well that day, everyone talked in his room for quite a long time. It seems that this "county magistrate" is one of the most privileged in the Feeling and Training Center, living alone in a room with a bed, a writing desk, and some pens, ink, paper, and a set of chess pieces on the cabinet. He used a pack of "Craven A" cigarettes and frequently offered them to every visiting reporter.</p>
<p>In addition to the conversation, everyone was given a mimeographed "Recollections of the Past Few Years." From his past history, we know that he had served as an instructor, a secretary in the commissioner's office, a secretary in the chairman's office, and a president of the local court. He started working in 1939 and defected on December 24, 1946, while serving as the County Magistrate of Gaoyou County, leading a special company of the county government.</p>
<p>He speaks with a slight stutter. Regarding his education, he said that after finishing three years at Fudan University, he later graduated from Sichuan University in Chengdu because of the War of Resistance. After that, he also lived in "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" for a year.</p>
<p>In this series of conversations, someone suddenly asked him what he thought was the most successful thing he did during his tenure as county magistrate.</p>
<p>He thought for a while, and then said falteringly, "Not being corrupt, not exaggerating..." But when we listened to him quietly, his tone seemed a bit forced.</p>
<p>Finally, he said: When he defected, his wife was in labor, so she couldn't come out with him. So someone asked him if she would be in danger? His facial expression did turn pale for a moment, and then he said helplessly, "That's hard to say!"</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>At the Guomin Grand Theater outside the city gate, a strong stench suddenly appeared in the theater during a Yue opera performance of "Autumn River Moon" on the afternoon of the 16th, causing people to vomit. The audience in the theater immediately fled. After investigation, it was found that a girl had broken several small glass tubes, from which the ozone gas was emitted. The case is currently being interrogated by the public security authorities.</p>
<p>Haining</p>
<p>Near Zhujiang Town along the highway in this county, road workers discovered a giant snake with a head as big as a dou (unit of volume) and four large snakes when digging for stones at the beginning of the month. A wave of superstition arose for a while, and it was rumored far and wide that it was the manifestation of the snake god. Those who went to the area to seek elixirs and divination blocked the road. Recently, people from Hangzhou and Shaoxing also heard the news and came specifically to worship. The local police went to investigate and prohibit it but were humiliated and beaten. Upon hearing the news, the county government sent police officers and all police officers from the police station to drive away the ignorant people and arrest several snake god monks who were the ringleaders and send them to the county for legal action.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>The First Pacification District Headquarters has recently designated Nantong's city defense police district, with the urban area as the center, extending east to Guanyin Ditch and Lu Hong Lock, west to Tianshen Port and Tangzha, south to Langshan, and north to Qinzao. Military and police security agencies within the district are all under the unified command of the concurrently serving city defense commander Gan Ji.</p>
<p>Jintan</p>
<p>The county government put up for public sale 1,000 dan (unit of weight) of autumn grain rice. The bidding results on the 16th showed that a Zou County merchant, not hesitating to pay the highest price of 57,200 yuan per dan, won the bid and purchased it for export. Local rice merchants believe that since the county government encourages people to bid at high prices, then the price of rice should be calculated based on the bid price and should not be subject to price review restrictions. Therefore, the price of rice in this county has once again experienced drastic fluctuations.</p>
<p>Bengbu</p>
<p>Guo Jian, the magistrate of Yiyang County, who is known for suppressing bandits, was indicted because he appointed Sun Zhongyu, who received the second-highest number of votes in the Tianpeng Township Sun Sai Baomin election, as the village head without authorization, arousing public outrage. On the 5th, when Guo went on patrol to the Datian market, the people of the village petitioned and questioned him. Guo angrily ordered the guards to stab Baomin Bai Yuxian and others, and then prevented them from being taken to the city for medical treatment and continued to arrest Sun Tongde and others. The victims have now filed a lawsuit with the court, and the township has organized a petition support association to appeal to all parties.</p>
<p>Minhang</p>
<p>The newly appointed Shanghai County Magistrate Yu Yueqiu arrived in the county on the 2nd of this month to take over his duties. The County Council has also been preparing and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 19th.</p>

<h3>Discussions on Austrian Treaty Progress Slowly: Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces New Disputes; Austrian Foreign Minister Rejects Yugoslav Territorial Demands</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 18th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber today pleaded with the Foreign Ministers' Conference to complete the Austrian treaty. However, observers generally feel that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference is in a stalemate, and the hope of establishing an Austrian treaty is rapidly fading. Several German experts in each delegation are now preparing to depart for Berlin, having already abandoned hope of continuing to seek progress on the German treaty. When Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber urged the Foreign Ministers' Conference to act quickly, he stated emphatically that the Austrian government would never sign the treaty if it gave any territory belonging to Austria to Yugoslavia. Much of Gruber's statement was in response to the demands made yesterday by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj and denied that there were racial, cultural, or other reasons to transfer Austrian land to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia is demanding the southern part of Austria's Carinthia region, and the question of the border issue and which Austrian German property can be used as compensation is now pushing the Foreign Ministers' Conference closer to a standstill. At this morning's meeting, the four foreign ministers clashed over the first major issue of the Austrian treaty, namely how to deal with the 50,000-plus gypsy people in Austria. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clashed with the foreign ministers of the three Western countries. The US delegation is preparing to stall in order to determine whether the Austrian treaty can be completed here.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 17th] The four foreign ministers continued to discuss the Austrian treaty today, first discussing Article 16, namely the clause on displaced persons, which is one of the most contentious points in the Austrian treaty. Although the foreign ministers apparently tried their best to compromise, they failed to reach an agreement and adjourned the item. However, the four foreign ministers agreed to repatriate the Germans who went to the warring countries because of the war, but they only failed to agree on certain details. As for the other seventeen military clauses, six were unanimously passed, three were partially passed, four were not discussed, and two were deadlocked. The two clauses that failed to reach an agreement were Article 17 (clauses on restricting Austrian national teams) and Article 27 (clauses on Austrian military research and equipment). Although the four foreign ministers unanimously agreed that the Austrian army should have 53,000 men, the navy 5,000 men, and 90 military aircraft, including 10 fighter jets, the Soviet Union hoped to stipulate that Austria could only use weapons and equipment made domestically, which was opposed by the foreign ministers of other countries, resulting in a failure to reach an agreement. Another proposal by France, advocating the establishment of a military expert committee in Austria to supervise the implementation of the military clauses, was automatically withdrawn by France after discussion. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss the economic clauses of the Austrian treaty tomorrow. According to observers, the foreign ministers of the four countries will need to hold six or seven meetings before they can complete the discussion of the Austrian treaty.</p>
<h3>Communist Parties in the Balkans Seeking to Control</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 17th] The inside story of the Communist Party's control of the four Balkan satellite states of the Soviet Union is now gradually becoming clear. According to reports received by the United Nations, the Soviet Union has long instructed the highest central committees of the Communist Parties of Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Bulgaria to handle territorial issues, supervise military operations on the Greek border, and guide the political ideology of Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Romania. One plan is to use guerrilla tactics to combine the Macedonian regions belonging to Greece and Bulgaria into an autonomous state, and then apply to merge into Yugoslavia. Bulgaria will seize all of Thrace from Greece and Turkey, thereby obtaining the Dardanelles Strait and the Aegean Sea ports. The Macedonian autonomy declaration was originally scheduled to be issued this spring, but it was suspended due to the strong actions taken by the United Kingdom and the United States. This can explain why the United Kingdom and the United States insisted that the United Nations agency's Greek border dispute investigation team should remain in place to monitor the Greek border while drafting a report, fearing that a sudden change might occur before the report is submitted and discussed by the Security Council. Thrace belonging to Greece and Turkey, except for the military bases desired by the Soviet Union, will all be given to Bulgaria. It is slightly rumored that Moscow has now abandoned the extravagant hope of Greece joining its Balkan satellite states.</p>

<h3>"Saving People and Helping Others, I Didn't Think This Was a Crime" Yuan Ludeng Admits "I Was Wrong" High Court Retrial, Disciples in Attendance Stand Up in Unison When He Arrives, Tang Shoumin, Lin Kanghou and Others Called to Testify</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," was originally sentenced to life imprisonment. After the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial, the High Court continued the investigation and trial in the afternoon yesterday, presided over by Judge Qiu Huan-ying. Many of Yuan's relatives and friends came to listen upon hearing the news, and there were no empty seats. Yuan was wearing a beige coat. When he entered the court, his disciples all stood up to show respect.</p>
<p>According to Yuan's confession: I was unable to leave Shanghai at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War due to being burdened with the affairs of the Shanghai Refugee Association as Secretary-General and due to economic difficulties. In the spring of the 30th year, Li Shiqun and Ding Mocun met with Yu Qiaqing. Because Elder Yu went to Hong Kong, they asked me to continue as the Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Because I had served as the Chinese Director of the Municipal Council for more than ten years, I was unable to refuse. I had informed Mr. Du Yuesheng in Hong Kong of the situation in a letter, which can be passed on for evidence. The pseudo-Rice Grain Control Association already existed. I only helped as the chairman of the association. The association only managed a part of the people's food supply. It negotiated with the Japanese army to allocate a part of the military rice as household rice. It never purchased military food from the enemy in place of rice. The allocation of household rice was 2 jin of rice per person per day until the interruption of household rice in April of the 33rd year. Therefore, around May 10, I claimed illness and entered the Hongqiao Sanatorium, and then resigned. The successor was Chen Guoquan. The pseudo-City Chamber of Commerce directors were publicly recommended because I was a director of the City Chamber of Commerce before the war. The trade associations already existed and were not organized by me. I have never attended the Committee on Material Control Deliberation. The chairman of the Baojia Preparatory Committee was because the public elected me after negotiating with the Japanese army to lift the blockade. The association did not establish rules and did not clear household registrations. The member of the Pseudo-New National Movement Promotion Committee was only a name, and I never went to Nanjing to attend meetings. The articles published in the pseudo-newspapers were all written on behalf by Chen Binsu and Yuan Shu. In the end, he said: I usually do things with my conscience. I only know how to save people and help others. I didn't think this was a crime. The court rebuked him, saying that these were all matters of colluding with the enemy, how could you try to excuse it with the words of helping. Yuan repeatedly said: I know I was wrong. Then Tang Shoumin, Chen Guoquan, Zhou Chunyu, and Lin Kanghou, who were in custody, were summoned to testify. Finally, the defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stood up and requested that Du Yuesheng, Xi Yushu, and He Dekui be summoned to testify at the next hearing. He also requested a postponement of the trial. The court ordered a re-examination at another date. The defendant waved to the relatives and friends on both sides when he was taken back into custody, repeatedly saying: "I'm sorry."</p>

<h3>Workers at China Textile Factory No. 1 Go on Strike; Lotte Wah Employees Petition</h3>

<h3>Warehouse Workers at Minfeng Paper Mill Engage in a Major Brawl</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Minfeng Paper Mill at No. 3, Lane 74, Ningbo Road, has a warehouse located at Da Wang Temple, North Chengdu Road, formerly the site of Jingcheng Paper Mill. Recently, due to labor-management disputes in the factory, a strike broke out on the 4th, which has continued to this day without resolution. Old workers such as Ma Weiqing stopped moving goods in the warehouse. Yesterday morning at 9:30, the factory hired old foreman Zheng Jinde, who led over 20 laborers to enter and work. Unexpectedly, they were blocked by a crowd of about 70 or 80 striking workers, who each held firewood sticks and arbitrarily attacked them, severely injuring Fang Jinde in the waist. The other laborers, Zhao Tingfu, were injured in the lower part of the body; Xu Chaoyou, in the head and buttocks; and Zhao Wenshan, in the left shoulder. Afterward, the injured were sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment by the factory. After receiving the report, the New City Police immediately dispatched officers to investigate the truth. However, the striking workers inside the factory guarded the factory gate, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. They had not dispersed by dusk.</p>
<h3>Commander of Captured American Ship Asks Mayor for Assistance to Aid Chinese Crew – Request to Petition National Government to Make Demands to the US</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Smith, the commander of the US Naval Reserve, has written to Mayor Wu, requesting a petition to the National Government to formally request the US Navy Department to provide prompt assistance to the loyal Chinese crew members of the former US warship "Wake" stationed in Shanghai. According to reports, the "Wake" had a total of 23 Chinese employees. When the Pacific War broke out in December 1941, they were arrested by the Japanese army, suffered abuse, and were forced to do hard labor for three and a half years. One of them was arrested and disappeared while trying to escape with the ship's commander, Smith, and his whereabouts are still unknown. His family urgently needs assistance. In addition, several others were subjected to torture and have become disabled. After the victory of the war against Japan, Smith repeatedly requested the US Navy Department to reissue the salaries that the Chinese crew members deserved during the war and asked to give them lifelong jobs. He has now received the approval of the Commander of the Pacific Fleet, but whether the US Navy Department will approve it is still a question. Therefore, Smith has specifically asked the mayor for assistance.</p>
<h3>Sudden Explosion of Oil Tanker on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At around 12 noon the day before yesterday, an oil tanker exploded at the border between Gaoqiao Town and Yangjing Town on the Huangpu River, and the fire was unstoppable for a time. Firefighters nearby immediately went to rescue, but the fire hydrant next to the oil tanker had been sabotaged beforehand. After using a pump to draw river water for rescue, the raging fire was extinguished. However, due to the unusual nature of the incident, the mysteries in it are worthy of study. Therefore, Captain Yu of the Inspection Brigade No. 1 of the Preparedness Department is already conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Gradual Collection and Inspection of Weights and Measures in the City</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau held a discussion meeting on the import of weights and measures yesterday afternoon. Xu Zifan, the director of the Weights and Measures Verification Institute, reported on the import procedures for weights and measures, saying: For the import of weights and measures, the customs must first obtain a permit from the Weights and Measures Verification Institute before it can be imported. The Verification Institute must first obtain a guarantee before issuing the temporary import permit, that is, within four days after picking up the goods, they must be brought to the Institute for verification of whether the system is legal and accurate before the permit is issued. The central government originally did not allow the import of British weights and measures, but now, to take care of merchants, imports are allowed. However, it must be modified, and only after the Verification Institute verifies that it is legal can it be used. Currently, the Verification Institute is gradually verifying all weights and measures in the city. Those that pass the inspection will be affixed with a sample mark, and citizens are asked to pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Eight People Prosecuted for Deceiving with Counterfeit Legal Tender After Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Zhixiu, Wang Xiangyun, Tai Jianguo, Luo Hongbin, Ma Junjie, Wang Gangqiang, Li Douzhi, Yang Zhiqiang and other eight people repeatedly used counterfeit legal tender (that is, using small tickets or Central Reserve Bank notes wrapped outside large tickets to deceive) to swindle businesses and illegally make profits. They were arrested by the police bureau and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. Now, Prosecutor Shen Zushou has concluded the investigation and believes that the defendants are engaged in fraud as a regular business. They have been charged with Article 340 of the Criminal Law.

<h3>Investigation of Garbage Dumping in the Huangpu River Has No Factual Basis</h3>
<p>Unsuitable Transportation Vessels Ordered to Be Replaced by Contractors</p>
<p>The city's garbage transportation work has been contracted out to merchants by the Health Bureau through bidding and has been underway for more than ten days. In recent days, it has been rumored that the Health Bureau has received accusation letters accusing the garbage contractors of dumping garbage into the Huangpu River, which is detrimental to public health. According to Director Yang of the Environmental Sanitation Division of the Health Bureau: After receiving the accusation letter from a certain Mr. Chuan, the Health Bureau immediately sent Technician Jiang to personally take a boat and secretly follow the garbage boat of the contractor for inspection. The investigation result was that there was no factual basis, and the accuser, Mr. Chuan, could not be found either. After investigation, the new contractor has performed well since starting work, but at present, most of the vessels used by the new contractor to transport garbage are unsuitable. If too many tons of garbage are loaded, the ship body will shake during sailing, and garbage on the ship surface will fall into the river at any time, which is also a fact that endangers hygiene. The Bureau has ordered the new contractor to pay close attention and immediately deploy qualified vessels to transport garbage.</p>

<h3>Digging Flesh to Heal Sores, Demolishing Dikes to Repair Dikes - Gaoqiao District Council Reports Bribery by Contractors of Dike Project</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Cui Zhiming, Chairman of the Gaoqiao District Council of this city, recently telegraphed the Municipal Council reporting the situation of bribery by contractors of the Seawall Project Team using old dike stones to repair dikes, requesting a thorough investigation and severe punishment. The telegram stated: "According to a telegram from the Gaoqiao District Seawall Project Supervision Committee, the Gaoqiao Seawall Project is huge and the expenses are enormous. How to carefully construct it to prioritize public funds and seek a permanent solution should be a matter of concern. However, it has been found that the three-layer four-stone stones of the outer dike outside the Jinjiazhai in the East Dike (the section from the north end of Changshuitian northward) were transported by the contractors of the Project Team to the outer dike of the Tangjia Tong Dike, which is currently being repaired, and priced as new stones for purchase. Digging flesh to heal sores and demolishing dikes to repair dikes is truly unheard of. Moreover, in broad daylight, without avoiding the eyes and ears of the public, they used vehicles from the Public Works Bureau to transport them. Such a blatant and massive bribery incident has never been heard of. In addition to telegraphed reports to the Supervisory Envoy's Office and the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau, requesting them to send personnel for on-site inspection and verification, this is hereby reported by telegram, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation and severe punishment."</p>
<h3>Verdict in Suspected Case of Bribery in Bidding - Pan Shufan and Others All Not Guilty - No Evidence of Crime in Seeking Welfare for Police Officers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of bribery in the bidding for cloth by the former Municipal Government Materials Management Office, which Chairman Jiang ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to directly send to the District Court for trial, has been heard by Judge Huang Guangyu. After the debate was concluded, the judgment was pronounced yesterday: "Pan Shufan, Xu Jingbo, and Liao Gongshao are all not guilty." The reasoning for the judgment is briefly stated as follows: The defendant, Pan Shufan, served as the Deputy Director of the Municipal Government Materials Management Office and was actually responsible for office affairs. It was found that the office put up 5,800 bolts of Lanfeng brand bleached cloth for bidding on February 14 last year. The public notice was only given for two days, which does not comply with Article 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Government Materials Management Office's Measures for Bidding and Selling Materials: "The public notice should be given three to five days before the opening of the bids." Moreover, Rongmao Cotton Cloth Company, which won the bid, had not yet joined the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. Pan Shufan, as the person actually in charge, could hardly shirk his responsibility for dereliction of duty. This is an administrative issue. As for the criminal responsibility of the defendant, there is a lack of active evidence of seeking profits. The second defendant, Xu Jingbo, is the Chairman of the Police Welfare Committee of the Municipal Police Bureau, and the third defendant, Liao Gongshao, is the Director of the General Affairs Office of the Police Bureau. They were also accused of forcing the merchant to resell 1,000 bolts at the original price plus 10,000 yuan per bolt after Rongmao won the bid, and were accused of joint corruption. Now, after investigation, it is clear that the resale was aimed at seeking welfare funds for police officers and was approved by Deputy Director Yu Shuping, with no possibility of seeking private gain. Moreover, there was no coercion in the resale, and there is no evidence of a crime. Therefore, a joint acquittal is declared.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Hosts Physicians from Various Hospitals for X-Ray Examinations, Exchanging Detailed Opinions During the Session</h3>
<p>In order to promote national health and advocate the anti-tuberculosis movement, this newspaper, in conjunction with the top ten hospitals, is sponsoring free anti-tuberculosis X-ray examinations. Applications will begin on the 20th of this month. All readers of this newspaper have the right to enjoy this free service. (See the Social Services section of today's newspaper for details.) Last night at 7:00 PM, this newspaper specially hosted the presidents and directors of the respiratory departments of the top ten hospitals at Xinghualou. Presidents Shen Kefei (represented by Liu Chengyi), Shen Xianshu, Zhu Yanggao (represented by Wu Bixiong), Fan Shouyuan, Wu Shaoqing, Chen Bangdian, Hui Yuezong, Gu Nankui, Dun Nanqun, Wang Yijing, and pulmonary department directors Sun Zhongliang, Jiang Qipeng, Zhang Youmei, Lin Qidong, Zhu Ermei, Cai Baoyi, Zhu Jianhua, Diao Yougong, Zheng Dingzhu, and more than 20 other people attended.

<h3>Students Solicit Donations on the Streets in Response to the Anti-Tuberculosis Movement</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee has actively carried out its work. The Lung Disease Center Clinic, located at 371 Huashan Road, has seen over 3,000 patients. Considering that many young students also suffer from tuberculosis, the Committee has requested students from various universities to launch an anti-tuberculosis street donation campaign on the first Sunday of next month to encourage students to respond to the anti-tuberculosis movement. At that time, 10,000 students will be mobilized to solicit donations along the streets, with a target of 50,000 yuan per person, totaling 500 million yuan. In addition, the Chengzhong Lung Sanatorium, located in the Yejia Garden in Jiangwan, has already had patients move in and will officially open soon. Therefore, starting last week, guests have been prohibited from visiting to avoid infection.</p>
<h3>UNRRA-Supplied Jeeps Will Be Allotted for Self-Use</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] UNRRA recently shipped 180 new-style jeeps and 60 jeep wagons from the United States.

<h3>Large Quantities of Rice, Wheat, and Soybeans Being Negotiated for Purchase and Will Be Shipped to Shanghai to Stabilize People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The measures taken by the government to increase the sources of supply of major people's livelihood materials can be summarized as follows: (1) Rice: The Food Bureau has entrusted the China Trust Bureau to order 200,000 tons of foreign rice from Vietnam and Burma, to be shipped in monthly quantities. It was originally scheduled to be fully shipped to China by the end of June this year, but due to difficulties in sea transportation, only about 60,000 tons have been shipped so far. In addition to sending personnel to Burma and Siam to supervise transportation, relevant parties have also negotiated with Chinese and foreign shipping companies to expedite the completion of transportation. (2) Wheat: Representatives of the China Trust Bureau are negotiating the purchase of 100,000 tons of wheat in Argentina, which is generally not a problem, but the formal contract is yet to be signed. The other party is responsible for transportation and delivery in Shanghai, and we bear the freight. (3) Soybeans: The China Trust Bureau plans to purchase 200,000 tons in the Northeast. However, due to price fluctuations and transportation difficulties, it is difficult to determine whether it can be fully purchased. Relevant people said: Whether a fixed amount of 8,000 tons per month can be supplied to oil factories in the city at a flat price depends entirely on the transportation situation. The biggest difficulty in soybean transportation is the insufficient railway transportation capacity in the Northeast, followed by the insufficient number of seagoing vessels. President Zhang of the Central Bank recently discussed with Chen Yanjiong, hoping to get more assistance in railway transportation. As long as transportation is no problem, sufficient quantities will be supplied.</p>
<h3>China Rural Service Society Organizes Weekend Tour</h3>

Special vehicles will be provided for transportation. Assemble at 8:30 AM in front of Citibank on Second Ma Road to take the bus and return to Shanghai at noon.</p>
<h3>Saving the God of Wealth Under Lingfeng Mountain - Owner of Xinda Xiang Rescued After Abduction - Ding Dading Said to Be Redeemed for 300 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ding Dafu, the owner of Xinda Xiang Silk and Cloth Store on Nanjing Road, took his family by boat to Ningbo (actually Dingjiashan) on the 8th to sweep tombs and host a housewarming banquet. The scene was lavish, and the guests were as numerous as clouds, which was coveted by bandits. On the 13th, at the second hour, four bandits broke in and kidnapped Ding Dafu and He Xiaru. At the same time, they looted cash, gold rings, clothes, and other items, as reported in the previous newspaper. After the incident, the bandits extorted 250,000 US dollars from Ding as a ransom and released He Xiaru first. Subsequently, the Zhenhai County Police Station received a tip that the hostage was hidden in the Dimu Temple at the foot of Lingfeng Mountain. They dispatched many police officers to search, and they found the hostage Ding Dafu inside. Two bandits guarding the hostage were captured on the spot, and Ding Dafu was rescued. Ding has been admitted to the local Huamei Hospital for recuperation due to physical discomfort.</p>
<p>Another report: After Ding was kidnapped, his family contacted the bandits. Because the asking price of 50,000 US dollars was too high, after several trips, they paid 300 million yuan in legal tender to redeem him. Ding himself has arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Ambush Outside Money Shop to Rob - Sprinkling Pepper Powder and Firing Guns to Resist Arrest - Two Criminals Ultimately Escape</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Outside the entrance of Dingkang Money Shop at No. 6, Weiqing Lane, Tianjin Road, at about 1:30 PM yesterday, two robbers lay in wait, focusing on the people going to withdraw money. Not long after, Zhang Huimin, an apprentice from Chunyuan Yarn Shop on Shiji Road, arrived with 5 million yuan for withdrawal. The two robbers saw the large amount of banknotes, and one of them took out a package of pepper powder and sprinkled it on Zhang's eyes, intending to rob him. After Zhang cried out loudly, the two robbers fled. On the way, they fired a shot, fortunately without hurting anyone. The patrolling police heard the alarm and chased after them, blowing whistles. Nearby traffic police gathered upon hearing the sound, but because there were too many pedestrians, the robbers were able to escape. At about 2:10 PM, a No. 3 revolver and three bullets were found next to the Shen Ji Line ladder at No. 37, Shanxi Road. After the shop's bookkeeper reported it to the Bureau of Examination, personnel were dispatched to take the gun and ammunition back. However, whether they belong to the robbers who failed to rob Dingkang Money Shop in Weiqing Lane is under investigation by the Bureau.</p>

<h3>Early News and Ten Major Hospitals Jointly Organize Anti-Tuberculosis Examinations</h3>
<h3>Health First!</h3>
<p>Our Newspaper Readers Can Apply for Free Check-ups</p>
<p>In order to promote national health and advocate for tuberculosis prevention, this newspaper has specially partnered with ten of the most renowned hospitals in the city, including Zhongshan, Sino-American, Renji, Gongji, Hongren, Municipal Second, Municipal Fourth, Guangci, Nanyang, and Hongqiao, to implement free X-ray examinations for tuberculosis prevention starting from April 20th. All Shenbao readers can apply for free check-ups by following the prescribed procedures. Each period will last for one month, and the program will continue based on actual circumstances, in accordance with the purpose of Shenbao serving society.</p>
<p>The spread of tuberculosis in our country is shockingly severe! According to expert statistics, the mortality rate is 400 out of every 100,000 people. If the national population is estimated at 450 million, approximately 1.8 million people die each year, which is more than the number of deaths on the battlefield or from war disasters and famines during the eight years of the War of Resistance. It can be said that the tuberculosis bacteria is a killer that draws no blood! Shanghai currently has 160,000 tuberculosis patients, with 16,000 deaths each year, which is greater than the total number of deaths from all infectious diseases in the city! Our country's tuberculosis prevention facilities are rudimentary, and most patients belong to the impoverished class. Especially after the war, with difficult living conditions and a harsh environment, many are unable to afford medical treatment after contracting this "disease of the wealthy," leading to transmission to others and creating a terrifying phenomenon! Furthermore, according to expert statistics, most deaths from tuberculosis occur in young people under the age of 25, who are the pillars of our national construction and the masters of the future. If prevention and treatment are not implemented early, the consequences will be unimaginable. Are our beloved readers aware of this?</p>
<p>Our newspaper, in cooperation with ten major hospitals for tuberculosis prevention, is conducting preliminary examinations entirely for advocacy purposes. We hope that the virtuous in society will provide assistance and plan for progress to eradicate this terrible bacterium. We especially hope that young readers will not conceal their illness and avoid medical treatment, bringing misfortune upon themselves. This is a small token of our newspaper's care for the youth. (Note: Free guidelines, a list of hospitals, application forms, and examination procedures will be published in this column starting from the 20th. Please take note.)</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Resolve the Cotton Spinning Crisis: A Unified Production and Sales Plan to Be Implemented; Private Yarn Factories and Government Officials Reach Consensus</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the cotton spinning industry in this city has recently faced obstacles in the reproduction and survival of the industry due to the price controls implemented by the Standing Bureau, causing price negotiations to deviate from cost prices and creating difficulties in the supply of raw cotton. After repeated research, a thorough reform plan for unified production and sales has been obtained for the future development of cotton weaving. It is understood that the principles adopted include unified supply of raw materials, unified planning of funds, and unified allocation of finished products. The thorough plan has been repeatedly discussed by representatives of various private yarn factories, Wu, concurrently Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, and Zhang, Governor of the Central Bank, and the two sides have reached a consensus. Once the government reorganization is completed next week and the personnel arrangements of various departments are finalized, the thorough plan is expected to be actively promoted and implemented.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, and Guo Litian, the executive directors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, visited Zhang, Governor of the Central Bank, at his residence at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. At around 4:00 p.m., they visited Wu, concurrently Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, to discuss the issue of maintaining the reproduction and survival of yarn factories for a considerable time. It is understood that the two sides had quite consistent opinions. Chairman Wu expressed his intention to retain Wang and others who resigned from their positions as members of the Textile Control Committee.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an authoritative figure in the cotton spinning industry in this city told our newspaper reporter that since the negotiated price of cotton yarn in this city has become increasingly detached from the market price, the government's sale of Zhangjiang has only resulted in intermediaries reaping huge profits. Direct consumers have not benefited, and the national treasury has also suffered losses. Furthermore, private yarn factories continue to face difficulties in opening yarn according to negotiated prices, and as a result, both reputation and morality are damaged. Therefore, under the current circumstances, what the authorities are implementing is nothing more than a passive and destructive control. In the absence of a better solution, a unified production and sales plan is still a kind of encouraging control. After the implementation of this plan, raw materials will be supplied by the government in a unified manner, and funds will also be planned by the government in a unified manner. The government will commission various yarn factories to manufacture finished products by placing orders, giving each yarn factory a reasonable profit. Although this profit cannot be used for the development of the business, the problem of reproduction and survival can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. At the meeting, Wang Qiyu, Zhao Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and Zhu reported on the process of resigning from their positions as members of the Textile Control Committee. The attending directors and supervisors expressed their admiration for Wang and others' tireless efforts in mediating multiple times and unanimously supported them. However, it was believed that this resignation was not related to the personal issues of Wang and others, but to the survival of the entire textile industry. The textile industry is related to the overall national economy and the people's livelihood and is extremely important for economic recovery. The current control policies of the authorities are threatening the survival of the industry, and there is a real need to seriously discuss methods of reform. It is understood that the association plans to convene a temporary general meeting of members in the near future to issue a declaration on the difficulties currently facing the industry, preparing to appeal to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Stable Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Government bonds were stable yesterday, miscellaneous brands flat. Traders in room 503, etc., first exited and then entered, the process thus went from low to high. Unified bonds opened in the morning at 14,100 yuan, the low price was 13,200 yuan, the high price was 14,700 yuan, and finally hovered at 14,000 yuan, a rise of 700 yuan compared to the previous closing. Unified E bonds also rose by 300 yuan, while A, B, and D bonds slightly fell by 100 yuan. In general, people have an optimistic atmosphere towards the reorganized government, and the turnover remained at more than 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stock Market Declines</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks slightly underperformed yesterday. Retail investors and traders in brokerage houses slightly unloaded their holdings. Yi Yarn opened at 40,500 yuan, but the high price did not exceed 41,000 yuan and then declined, with the low price reaching 39,100 yuan, before then presenting a flat picture. Rubber stocks revived buying interest. As a result, shipping and steel stocks each fell by about 10%, while other stocks also fell slightly.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bonds Can Be Mortgaged to Banks for 70% of the Cash Value</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Responsible officials of the Ministry of Finance stated that the Ministry of Finance has considered the promotion methods for US dollar bonds and short-term treasury bills and has decided that these bonds can be mortgaged to banks for 70% of their value to obtain cash. In this way, the market can be made more flexible, and at the same time, buyers will be encouraged to purchase them, and the main purpose of the issuance and the maintenance of its credit can also be achieved.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Tight Credit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The market credit has been slightly tight recently, and there are rumors that the National Bank secretly intends to tighten it. After inquiries with major banks by the reporter, it was proved that the main reason for the slightly tight credit at that time was due to the sale of a portion of cotton. At the same time, various factories are now paying a portion of their taxes, using up some of their funds. As for US dollar bonds, they do absorb a portion of floating capital. For example, Zhejiang Industrial Bank alone has absorbed more than 3 billion yuan, but from the perspective of the entire market, the impact is not very large.</p>
<h3>The Issuing Department of the National Bank Denies Issuing Large Denomination Notes</h3>
<p>Responsible officials from the issuing department of the Central Bank stated that the recent rumors that the department is about to issue 10,000-yuan large denomination notes are completely unfounded. The reporter further inquired about the exact number of 50-yuan Customs Gold Unit (关金券) notes currently in circulation. It was said that the exact number issued could not be disclosed, but in short, the amount issued is still far from meeting the needs of the market. Various banks and firms repeatedly request to exchange Customs Gold Unit notes from the National Bank, but only a limited amount can be paid.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Xu Botuan, Deputy Minister of Finance, told reporters at the Silver Association this afternoon: (If there is a need in the market, 10,000-yuan banknotes can be issued in moderation.) According to the previous meeting of the Legislative Yuan, some legislators passed opinions prohibiting the issuance of large denomination banknotes. The Ministry of Finance then submitted a request to the Executive Yuan based on the actual needs, and the Executive Yuan has replied: that if there is a need in the market, they can be issued in moderation.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Association Holds Meeting to Discuss Difficulties Faced by Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Yarn Merchants Association of this city, due to the urgent situation and business difficulties faced by its members, who have flocked to the association to request that the authorities be asked for relief, convened a temporary meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the association, presided over the meeting. Tang reported five difficulties faced by the members: (1) Private factories have not been allocated raw materials for a long time, and they cannot allocate and sell cotton yarn, so members cannot replenish the cotton yarn they sell. The Textile Construction Company only limits each company to one bale, resulting in a phenomenon of imbalance between supply and demand. (2) The price of banknotes in various outer ports is higher than in Shanghai, and they are flocking to Shanghai to purchase them, but due to the negotiated price relationship in Shanghai, the Zhangjiang price cannot be stabilized. The authorities should be asked to reasonably adjust the yarn price. (3) Recently, the authorities have been checking the accounts of the same industry from time to time, and there are even rumors of legal measures being taken, causing members to feel uneasy. Can the authorities be requested to waive the investigation in order to understand the difficulties of the industry? (4) The profit of the industry was previously stipulated at 5%, but now the Textile Construction Company only allocates one bale of yarn to each company, and the profit earned is not enough to cover expenses. Please adjust the profit to maintain operations. (5) Please ask the association to quickly request relief from the competent authorities, increase the amount of yarn allocated, adjust the yarn price, and increase the profit of the yarn merchants. After discussion, it was resolved: In order to protect the business of the members, in addition to accepting the requests of the members, documents will be prepared immediately to request relief from the relevant competent authorities.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The association decided to prepare documents and go to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Garrison Headquarters, the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Textile Control Committee, and other agencies next Monday to request relief.</p>

In deferred delivery, Yong Yarn and Jingfu fell weakly by 0.5%, Shuigong rose to the limit, Xinhuo and Huafeng slightly fell, and Mei Ya slightly rose. Cold stock Match rose to the limit, Rongfeng rebounded after suspension, Zhongsheng fell, Liai rose by 10%, and the rest of the stocks were flat or fell weakly by 0.5%. Outside the market, except for Dasheng which slightly rose, the rest looked flat and weak.</p>
<h3>License Revoked for No. 198</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a notice yesterday: (excerpt omitted) Broker Tong Zhongzhou of the Shanghai Stock Exchange absorbed deposits, violating the provisional business rules of the exchange and the current regulations for managing banks. His business license should be revoked as a warning to others. As for the broker's change of capital, which was not reported, the original was not in compliance, but since the license has been revoked, it can be exempted from further punishment.</p>
<h3>Buyers Wait and See, Transactions Are Sluggish; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Trend Weak; Tianjin Yarn Prices Have Already Fallen Back Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn was opened for sale by Textile Construction Company as usual yesterday morning. 42-count Jianfeng was listed at 7.55 million, 40-count Football at 6.7 million, 32-count Double Strand Xiantao at 6.8 million, 32-count Yinyue at 5.4 million, and 20-count Xincheng and Tianfunu at 3.6 million. 16-count Jinhu at 3.2 million. 10-count Boy Scout at 2.45 million. Bids outside the market were still mostly flat and weak, and manufacturers and customers remained hesitant. It was heard that 16-count Guangming was trading secretly at 4.7 million, but the rest were sluggish.</p>
<p>Estimated opening of cotton cloth was not smooth. Due to the weak trend yesterday, sentiment was depressed, buying interest was flat, and transactions were very few. Bids continued to decline. Longtou fine cloth was bid at 223,000 yuan, Wufu at 210,000 yuan, Siqun and Riyuan Biji Jin Yin from 217,000 yuan to 213,000 yuan, and the lowest bid was 210,000 yuan. However, among the Shilin cloth, Xiaoji Shilin unexpectedly rose alone, with the factory bid as high as 400,000 yuan, while other Shilin cloth remained unchanged.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee yesterday as usual, totaling 2,647 pieces, including 2,262 pieces for manufacturers and 385 pieces for yarn numbers. Manufacturers submitted a total of 1,504 application forms. A total of 385 households applied for yarn numbers.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to yesterday's Shen Xinwen, the 20-count Tiannu yarn shipped to outer ports was 6 million yuan per piece (the negotiated price was 3.7 million yuan per piece). It was heard that a telegram came from Shenyang yesterday, stating that the yarn price in that area has reached 10 million yuan per piece due to the Tianjin shipping export relationship. On the Tianjin side, the price has fallen back.</p>
<h3>Chinese Peppermint Shipped to the United States</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, New York, 18th] The Business Periodical reported that fresh menthol will be shipped from China to this area at the end of this month. The import of this item will alleviate the general tight supply situation.</p>
<h3>Production Price Reported to Resist, Sales Increase; Grain Market Trend Slightly Eases; Mayor Expresses Strict Crackdown on Black Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a total arrival of about 1,800 dan (石) from the north and south. Although the source was scarce, the production price in the inland area has turned down, and 100 to 200 ships from the Wuxi and Suzhou areas will be transporting food to Shanghai. High costs might mean some damage to the goods, but once the goods flood in, prices will inevitably fall back. The market price of white yuan and silver yuan is stable, while the market price outside the market has fallen by 10,000 yuan, but there are few buyers.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Social Affairs Bureau threw out a total of 9,000 bags of white japonica, red Xian, and Dinggong rice at the same price as the previous day. The market trend has eased considerably as a result. Market transactions, apart from the purchase of rationed rice, are very few. Outside the market, the bid for japonica thin rice is still above 170,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation Will Be Conducted for Exceeding the Price Limit</p>
<p>[Another Report] Mayor Wu met with reporters in the Municipal Government conference room yesterday afternoon and said: The rice market has been fluctuating in recent days due to reports of rising prices in the production areas. Now, the government has ordered the suppression of prices in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places. Although the black market prices in Shanghai are very rampant, they have now fallen back. In the future, the price limit for food rice will still be 130,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau will continue to sell large quantities of white rice and foreign rice. If rice merchants continue to price above the limit, a strict investigation will be conducted, and the black market will be strictly cracked down. Furthermore, the Mayor has scheduled to meet again with the leaders of the rice business and rice shop associations, Cha Bao San and Qu Zhenhua, etc., at 8:30 a.m. this morning. It is reported that they will discuss reducing the retail price. At the same time, the sales price of social rice will also be proportionally reduced, because the rice price in the production area has fallen by 4,000 yuan yesterday, and it is expected to continue to fall in the future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Prices All Fall</h3>
<p>Flour continued to fall by 1,000 yuan yesterday, and bran also weakened by 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake followed and fell by more than 1,000 yuan. Edible oil was allocated according to party affiliation, but outside the market, it plummeted by more than 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil also dropped sharply by 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were sluggish and fell again by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame and other items followed the downstream and fell back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum weakened slightly. Wheat fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to the decline in the flour market.</p>
<p>Soybeans turned strong by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan because oil factories still have some demand. They are hovering in a circular pattern. Broad beans still sold well and rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, while raw peanuts, sesame, soybeans, rapeseed, etc., which are all raw materials for oil production, have been banned from export.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Tea Has Few Actual Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market in foreign firms, since the sellers' intention to sell has slightly improved, the trend has not been as loose as in recent days, and prices have been barely maintained. However, transactions were still unremarkable due to the lack of smooth negotiations between buyers and sellers. Only Wang Yutai and Wuchang have been involved in recent days. As for domestic sales of tea, supply and demand are difficult to distinguish, and it is unusually peaceful.</p>
<h3>High Tung Oil Prices Hinder Sales</h3>
<p>The tung oil market situation yesterday was that the Hankou position was extremely tight, banks could not provide timely transportation, inventory was weak, and the exchange rate soared, causing tung oil to rise by 60,000 yuan. It is worried that apart from a small amount of domestic sales in the market yesterday, the foreign sales market has been very limited, because foreign prices have been cut again, and domestic prices have exceeded foreign spot prices, with little trading.</p>
<h3>Carrying National Currency Out of the Country Is Not Allowed to Exceed 500,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jianghai Customs issued a notice: According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, it is stipulated that anyone traveling from various places in China to Hong Kong or other regions outside the country, the national currency carried by each traveler shall not exceed 500,000 yuan, unless approved by the Ministry of Finance and issued a passport. Those who carry more than the prescribed amount will have all the excess amount confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fish Vendors Resumed Operations Yesterday; Mediation Extended for One Week; Both Parties Seek Solutions Externally</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The fish vendors in this city who went on strike before have resumed operations yesterday under the persuasion of the Social Affairs Bureau. The fish vendors association went on strike previously to oppose the establishment of a joint cashier's office by the Fish Business Association to implement a unified collection method. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened mediation, it was decided to postpone the establishment of the joint cashier's office, and the fish vendors resumed operations first.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the bureau convened representatives of both sides again to discuss unfinished matters. Due to the fish vendors' insistence on opposing the joint cashier's office organization, the negotiations were unsuccessful. However, both sides, remembering their past cooperation, were unwilling to create rifts because of this, so they agreed to seek solutions externally, with a deadline of one week. The negotiation results will be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau one week later.</p>
<p>As for the Haichan Transportation and Sales Association's request for compensation from the fish market for the losses suffered due to the delay of more than 4,000 dan of goods due to the fish vendors' strike, it was not discussed yesterday because the representatives did not arrive.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from a Visit to Northern Shaanxi (3): A Stroll Through "Liangshanbo"</h3>
<p>— Yan'an Nine-Day Express News, Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhu</p>
<p>If we were to divide the Shaanxi map into two circles, one centered on Guanzhong and the other on Yan'an, Luochuan would probably be the dividing point. South of Luochuan, it is currently a paradise on earth, while north of it, there is a sky filled with sand and wind, with fluctuating temperatures.</p>
<p>Yan'an is regarded as "Liangshan," and it is said that many people came here in the past because they were "forced" to. After living here for a week, Yan'an makes me feel a distance from many things in Xi'an. There are no rows of Western-style houses here, nor crisscrossing streets. There are only two simple main streets, forming an irregular T-shape. A dozen years ago, Yan'an was just a small town of four or five thousand people. After the Communists arrived here in the twenty-third year, after more than a decade of development, they touted it as the "Red Capital," making people feel somewhat like "Liangshanbo" in "Water Margin." It is said that at its peak, there were about 100,000 people (around 1928-29). My impression of Yan'an is that it is chaotic, small, and simple, in short, a small city.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Scenes Within the City</p>
<p>In Yan'an, you will find few trees, few people (the current population within the city is seven or eight thousand), few wastelands, few shops, and few door panels on the street houses. Whether it's the earthen mountains surrounding Yan'an or the various counties in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia "Border Region," apart from the mountainsides that have been cultivated into fields, there is nowhere that is forested. However, you will also find many auditoriums, many empty houses, and many women and children (comparatively speaking); In these few days, we have seen six or seven large auditoriums. Apart from a few that are quite well-built, most are not very exquisite, without paint, carvings, or ceilings. Only at the entrance is there usually a patterned painting, representing the symbol of the auditorium.</p>
<p>The prices here are very high, about half as much again as in Xi'an. Most businesses are not open, only many small stalls on the street, selling mostly cigarettes and daily necessities, all transported from Xi'an. Occasionally, there are cigarettes and pencils left over from the past, but they are all broken and unusable, but the matches are still usable. The people have a good relationship with the National Army, the elderly are very happy, young people are rarely seen on the street, and the women hope for a quick, peaceful life. More and more people are returning every day. If you often stroll on the street, you will find that Yan'an is much warmer than it was a few days ago.</p>
<p>Desolate Abandonment</p>
<p>We have visited the residences and offices of former personnel, and these places are now desolate and abandoned, with courtyards full of messes. Although most of the buildings are not magnificent, they are much better than the residences of the ordinary people in northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Yangjialing is north of the Yan River, about five or six li from Yan'an. This is where the CCP Central Committee was located, and there is a large auditorium with a "red star" and hammer and sickle symbol above the door. The stage inside is very grand, and the CCP's plenary sessions in recent years (after 1940) have all been held here. On the north side of the hall is a large dance hall, with a highly polished floor. It is said that many dances have been held here, and this is the "recreational activity resort" for CCP officials. Further north are the dining hall and library, which are quite luxurious, no less than those in Xi'an. Due to the lack of wood in the vicinity of Yan'an, there are very few houses for the residents, and they are all arched cave dwellings built of adobe, with large windows and plenty of light. From ordinary people to CCP officials, they all live in this kind of house. Mao Zedong's former residence is on the slope north of the CCP Central Library. There are a few pieces of wooden furniture in the cave, and outside there is a small kitchen. The only difference between this and other rooms is that there are springs on the dilapidated sofa. In this courtyard, there are four cave dwellings, and to the northeast, there are eight cave dwellings built exactly the same. It is said that these are the residences of Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and others.</p>
<p>CCP Army Headquarters</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Eighteenth Group Army (i.e., the CCP Army) is also a hall, but it is not very large and is also very simple. Next to the hall are three caves, each with three cave dwellings below. These were the offices of Peng Dehuai and Lin Biao, etc., a long time ago. These many guest rooms are built against the mountain, with bridges separating them on all sides. There is a courtyard, with inner and outer courtyards, each with four rooms. The outer courtyard is the office, and the inner courtyard is Zhu De's bedroom. There are many kinds of wooden furniture in the room. (In fact, there is just as much wooden furniture in Zhu and Mao's room, and it is all made very sturdy and painted yellow.) Every two cave dwellings are connected together, with small holes in the middle. You can't walk near the base of the wall, and landmines that have not been swept away are still buried underground. On the large parade ground, many captured militiamen are standing. These people are all ragged, but they have no color on their faces. They don't seem to have much feeling about the Battle of Yan'an, and they have a bit of a "carefree" attitude. North of the parade ground, there is a large camp-style building. Due to time constraints, we didn't go to see it and wanted to return immediately.</p>
<p>A Full View of Zaoyuan</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Yan'an says that "Zaoyuan" is the place with the best scenery, and this is the residence of "Labor Hero" Wu Manyou. Since this "hero" "voluntarily" "donated" the land, it has become the residence of CCP officials. There are large pear trees and peach trees in the garden, and now they are all budding, full of spring. The entire garden covers more than 300 mu, with a small dance hall in the middle, the floor of which is highly polished. On the wall hangs a plaque with the words "Savior of the People." Not far to the southwest of the dance hall are three Western-style houses, said to be the residences of foreign advisors when the CCP occupied Yan'an. There were often more than 20 people living here. In the kitchen near the three Western-style houses, we saw thirteen Western-style stoves. Mao Zedong also had a residence here. It is said that this is his summer villa, located on a high place on the hillside, overlooking the entire garden. The house is a small chapel-style Western-style building, with many thatched roofs on top, probably for shelter. There are three offices, two dormitories, and a "wireless room" equipped quite completely. Now all the important things have been moved away, leaving only some farm implements and the remnants of the electric wires on the walls.</p>
<p>At the entrance of Zaoyuan are the words "Yan Garden," which is the name changed after the CCP came to Yan'an. Kang Sheng and Chen Yun's residences are near Mao's residence, all in a row of four or five cave dwellings. In the mountainous areas near the garden, there are air-raid shelters that penetrate into the bedrock of the mountain, which are quite dangerous.</p>
<p>The Desolation of the Old City</p>
<p>The old city of Yan'an has not been rebuilt since the Japanese planes bombed it wildly in 1928 and 1929. Now, as the car speeds past, all that can be seen is broken tiles everywhere, a desolate scene.</p>
<p>He Long's headquarters is now the Farmer-Soldier Hospital. On the walls of the CCP Party School, there are slogans left over from opposing the Central Committee. Like other places, there are no large trees in the courtyard, only willow trees that are about a zhang tall.</p>
<p>Yan'an University is at the southern end of the New Market. Apart from the auditorium and kitchen, there are only two or three classrooms and more than a hundred cave dwellings. There are many trenches in the aisles of the school. There are things buried underground. When I walked past, I saw several soldiers digging up many wooden boards and broken books from the underground cave.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government is the residence of the reporters. Many "guests" live in the two rows of cave dwellings. The place where Lin Boqu used to work is now our dining hall. The interiors of the cave dwellings here are all plastered with lime, clean and tidy, and the exteriors are all walled with stone strips and built with corridors. In the barren northern Shaanxi, this is indeed considered quite magnificent.</p>
<p>The Border Region Assembly has only one auditorium. The Xinhua Bookstore has also left behind only an empty room. The Border Bank is the best and most magnificent building.</p>
<p>Impoverished to the Bone</p>
<p>Before coming to Yan'an, someone told me that northern Shaanxi was a place for people on business trips, but after I arrived, I found that the people of northern Shaanxi are now truly impoverished to the bone, living in broken houses and wearing clothes patched with thousands of stitches. Apart from the tattered clothes, the people of northern Shaanxi are quite healthy.</p>
<p>Although the Yan'an market is gradually recovering, it seems that I have not heard any specific plans on how to allocate so many CCP army residences and offices. The current problem should be to try to bring everything back to normal. The "Moscow of the East," the modern "Liangshanbo," is poor, chaotic, and narrow.</p>
<p>Cave Dwellings or Mansions?</p>
<p>Before withdrawing from Yan'an, CCP leaders lived in magnificent mansions and spent their lives there. (Top) A panoramic view of the CCP "Central Auditorium." (Bottom) After the National Army recovered Yan'an, residents returned to their hometowns one after another. Relief funds were distributed to poor women and children, and a National Army Service for the People Office was specially set up to be in charge of relief matters.

<h3>On Organizing a Branch of the "Writers Association": A Belief, An Attitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Jinshan</p>
<p>On January 26, 1946, when the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Workers and Writers Association was organized and established in Chongqing, I wrote a short essay. The general idea was:</p>
<p>China's literary and artistic land is originally a desolate wilderness of weeds. Moreover, it has gone through eight years of catastrophe, and there are so many things to do. Writers, who are shamelessly human spirit technicians, are "carrying a heavy burden and a long road." Therefore, we sincerely hope that writers across the country should first unite and unite by party, and the national literary and art circles should first unite and unite for national unity. Furthermore, we should take the democratic unity of the group as a model for the democratic unity of the whole country; and the writers' self-respect and mutual respect should be the basis for the people's self-respect and mutual respect, participation in politics, and constitutional governance.</p>
<p>Although this is a piece of artistic talk from more than a year ago—at that time it was during the political consultation period—now that times have changed and I am revisiting the old work, I am truly overwhelmed with emotion. However, my belief has not changed: I always believe that literature and art are beyond politics, that groups are not the tails of parties, and that literary and artistic undertakings are the undertakings of all mankind. In addition to having the rights and obligations of a national citizen to the country, writers do not necessarily express the narrow political opinions of political parties in their writing. Of course, I do not deny that modern writers are not all politically neutral, or that writers do not want to participate in political activities: however, that is another matter. If we only talk about a writer's writing, it is not necessary to confuse political propaganda and pure literary creation.</p>
<p>The theme of a work is based on the writer's thoughts and personality, and is a reflection of the writer's worldview and real life. However, this has the difference between breadth and narrowness, and the difference between abstract and concrete from the political propositions of political parties. Strictly speaking, the responsibility of a writer is to be faithful to his feelings, faithful to his experiences, grasp his emotions, and reflect life in response to reality. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," Mao Dun's "Midnight," and Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," etc., have all faithfully fulfilled this responsibility, so they have won a wide range of readers and audiences.</p>
<p>Some people say that literary and artistic undertakings are a kind of emotional education, and I agree. I also believe that it is emotion that stimulates creativity in our thoughts and behaviors, that makes the writer's life and his works one, and that what radiates the light like the stars in the dark night is emotion. And the key to the one heart connection, association and combination between writers and writers, that is, between people, is also emotion. —Emotion is the greatest mystery in the universe.</p>
<p>Therefore, the organization of a writer's group is not a passive act of agreeing with one's own kind and rejecting others, but an active act to promote friendship and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>"Birds chirping softly, seeking their friend's voice," this is the feeling of emotional response of species; "Gathering friends with literature, assisting benevolence with friends," this is the feeling of emotional response of literati. Unaffected and extremely natural. Therefore, a writer's participation in a group organization only asks whether you are faithful to art, faithful to your feelings and experiences, and if you do not deny your enthusiasm, but also love free writing; then no one needs to ask anyone's religious beliefs or political relations. Everyone is a good friend, (Even if the smell is not completely compatible, it is not necessarily an enemy.) Everyone can shake hands and work together in the literary and artistic garden that has become even more barren after the war.</p>
<p>World culture has never had a force that can stop its exchange. Why can't a limited number of writers in a country get along harmoniously? At this year's drama festival, we saw a grand gathering of the drama world, no longer distinguishing between Nan Tian and Bei Xiong, or Mei school and Qi school; local operas and dramas, crosstalk and singing were all performed on the same stage. Zhuang Zhou said: "The carp in the dried rut, moisten each other with saliva, and breathe each other." Because we can't aspire to rivers and lakes yet! Therefore, I believe even more that this is the beginning of a new stage of the Chinese New Culture Movement, and it is also the dawn of the Chinese Renaissance. Therefore, in the literary and art world, there is no longer any left wing or right wing, Beijing school or Shanghai school; the Literary Research Association and the Creation Society have long been integrated together, and the Yu Si Society and the Modern Society have also become a family. What everyone needs now is to jointly establish a new belief in creation and create a new style of modern Chinese literature and art.</p>
<p>Recently, the Writers Association wants to organize a branch in Shanghai. Several friends talked about this issue. Of course, some people inevitably have some concerns; I said that this kind of organization is actually needed. Shanghai is the cultural center of the country, and it is also the confluence of cultural exchanges; the Shanghai Writers Association not only affects writers across the country, but the Shanghai Writers Association is also concerned by China and foreign countries, and is noticed by writers around the world. Therefore, I feel that since an organization is needed in objective fact, what needs to be considered is not whether there is a conflict with groups of a similar nature, but whether we can organize a "real" writers' own group. Because a "real" group is a combination of the personalities of people, an exchange of emotions; and only through "truth" can "goodness" be accomplished, and "beauty" can be developed—this is my belief.</p>
<p>Based on this belief, I feel even more that every writer may as well actively participate in the organization of the Writers Association branch: First, break the past concepts of leadership and the boss system, no one monopolizes it, and no one is allowed to manipulate it; do not accept government subsidies, do not seek social relief, and do as much as you can with as much power as you have. Purely based on friendship as a binder and mutual assistance as a sustaining force, not only is it unnecessary to build a large door, but even the boundaries of the surrounding walls should not exist; if there must be boundaries, then it is the boundaries of the entire literary and art world. Only ask whether you are a writer, whether you are a writer residing here. If so, then you should extend the hand of friendship to express a sincere welcome, and welcome everyone to organize a Shanghai writers' own group together. —This is an attitude of mine toward this kind of organization.</p>
<p>If a group, in addition to the emotional connection and business cooperation between members mentioned above, must also have its realistic goals, then, in my opinion, the goal of this group is at most to strive for freedom of writing and publishing, and to protect the rights of writing and publishing; and then to establish a free style of modern Chinese literature and art, and promote the revival of modern Chinese literature and art. Therefore, it not only does not conflict with existing literary and art groups, and will not cause friction, but it should also be hoped that similar sister groups will continue to emerge. Because this is not a party organization, nor is it a guild combination. Similar groups can complement each other, and of course, they may also undergo metabolism. A writer may well participate in more than two similar groups; and two sister groups may also jointly hold various activities. In this way, writers can walk in front of politics, value their own mission, and respect our tasks. In this way, the group will have its future, and literature and art can become a common undertaking of mankind that will last forever—this is another view of mine.</p>
<p>P.S.: The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Writers Association now has a number of membership registration forms, and entrusts the Chunqiu Editorial Office of this newspaper to handle the membership application procedures on its behalf. Those who are interested in joining, please attach a return envelope for a letter, and the deadline is at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Hongwei Old Man's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Fang Jiekan</p>
<p>In the autumn of Bingxu year, Hongwei Old Man came to Shanghai from Chongqing. Coincidentally, his nephew Zheng Zimanqing was also holding a painting exhibition in Shanghai, so he went to visit him immediately. Although the old man is nearly seventy years old, his ears and eyes are sharp, and his spirit is strong, like someone in his forties; he can be said to be blessed by nature. The old man said that he had obtained the method of meditation, and that he had achieved this through it. It can be said that books and paintings can not only benefit the world, but also that those who are nourished by nature's essence will surely enjoy a long life. People in the world often discuss that the emphasis of calligraphy and painting should be on brush and ink, and that the spirit should be the main thing. If the spirit is insufficient, then nothing can be accomplished, not to mention artistic matters. I said that the brush and ink can be used to observe the original thinness of the blessings and longevity of the ancients. The old man's painting skills are exquisite, and his workmanship is deep. He has long been highly praised at home and abroad. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once inscribed the words "Comparable to Xu and Huang" and presented them to him, which is a well-known story in the art world. For a year since then, the old man has been wielding his brush day and night, studying hard and never tired. He has created more than a hundred works of flowers, birds, grass, insects, trees, and rocks. Most of them are painted with meticulous outlines, and the colors are ancient and beautiful, lifelike. The calligraphy is elegant and graceful, obtaining the essence of Chu Suiliang. The poems are also fresh and light, with the charm of the Song Dynasty, which is even more precious. I said that meticulous brushwork is the most difficult to be lively. If you only engage in depiction, it will be stiff and lack spirit, and it will not be taken seriously by those who know art; the key to this is the precision of the outline; if it is precise, it will be lively and spirited, and its meaning and expression will often come from outside the brush and ink, and the aura of harmony and simplicity will overflow on the paper, making it tireless to watch. Now the old man is indeed better than and no less than this, so it is not accidental that the world treasures every inch of silk and paper he creates. Now the old man has taken out his recent works to be exhibited at the China Painting Gallery, making them public to the world. The world knows it, and I know that there will definitely be a crowd one after another to view the masterpiece and be happy.</p>
<h3>Kite—Yangzhou Continued Dream No. 14</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>The "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record" says: "Kites are popular during Qingming Festival. The sound is in the bow, and the force is in the tail. The large ones are one zhang square, and the tail is up to two or three zhang long. The style is mostly rectangular, called a board door. The rest are mostly crabs, centipedes, dragonflies, butterflies, 'Fu' characters, and 'Shou' characters, followed by Chen Miaochang's meeting with the monk, the old camel and the young camel, and Chu Bawang. And things like rejoicing, and universal peace, are extremely ingenious in craftsmanship. In the evening, they often hang lights on the tail, up to three or five in a row." According to what I saw in my childhood, there are many differences. When it comes to "Kites are popular during Qingming Festival," it has always been so, and it is the same everywhere. If "the sound is in the bow," it should depend on the size of the kite. The smaller ones do not have bows, so naturally there is no sound to be heard. The larger ones use cattail bows, the larger ones use rattan bows, and the largest ones use bamboo bows. All of them are made by scraping the cattails, rattan, and bamboo extremely thin to serve as bowstrings. As for "the force is in the tail," this is not the case for all kites. For example, centipedes (called "centipedes" by the people of Yangzhou). Regardless of size, they are all tailless. Among other finely made kites, such as crabs, dragonflies, and butterflies, they are also tailless. There are also single tails, double tails, and triple tails. The tails used for small kites are just thin string coins, while the larger ones require thicker ropes. What is called "the style is mostly rectangular, called a board door," the board door refers to the larger ones, and the smaller ones are called gluten bubbles. The method of making gluten bubbles is extremely simple, and the price is extremely cheap. Most of the kites flown by children belong to this type.</p>
<p>The form of kites can be roughly divided into two types, large and small. Among the small ones, in addition to gluten bubbles, most of them are high-quality products. What is called "extremely ingenious in craftsmanship" is indeed worthy of the name. The prices are not cheap, especially small centipedes are the most expensive. Because the quality of small centipedes depends not only on whether they are tied beautifully, but also on whether the whole body is symmetrical. If it is slightly asymmetrical, it will continue to somersault when released into the sky, and finally fall back into the dust. This somersaulting of kites is called "calling" by the people of Yangzhou. Small centipedes have about a dozen sections, including the head and tail. It is considered a high-quality product if it can be released into the sky and be able to dance in a lively manner without somersaulting and falling. In addition, crabs, dragonflies, butterflies, eagles, and beauties all belong to the small category, and most of them are fine products. Very few ordinary children fly this type of kite, so it becomes the exclusive product of wealthy young masters and silk-clad young men.</p>
<p>In addition to board doors in the large category, there are also hexagons, octagons, nine-linked lanterns, large centipedes, etc. Small kites can be flown with cotton thread or silk thread, but these large ones must use hemp rope, and they cannot be controlled well by one or two people. Those who fly this type of kite are mostly adults, and mostly lower-class people who are fond of courage and fighting. After releasing them into the sky, they will tie the rope to a tree, and then gather in groups of three or five to chat and appreciate them. Smaller kites, if they happen to touch their ropes, are always entangled and difficult to separate, and eventually become vassals of their large kites, floating beside them. They are the victors, and they will clap and cheer for a while, while the losers can only be depressed. Especially the children, often holding back their tears, staring up for a long time, before leaving three steps back and two steps back. Occasionally, if they encounter opponents of similar strength, they will roll up their sleeves and bare their arms, first scolding each other, and then fighting each other.</p>
<p>These many large kites, in addition to bows, also have bells or whistles. The sound of the bow is loud, the sound of the bell is clear, and the sound of the whistle is clear. They echo in the sky at the same time, which is quite pleasing to the ear. Most of them are not taken down in the evening, and some red lanterns are added to the ropes. Whether what the "Wing Navigation Record" says about "tying lights to the tail" is a misremembered by Li Dou, or whether it is different from the past, is unknown.</p>
<p>In the past, the locations for flying large kites, in addition to outside the city, were the Dawangbian in the old city and Kangshan in the new city. Since there are more and more houses in Kangshan, and there is less and less open space, and the Dawangbian was built as a school, it is not easy to find a suitable location in the city. In addition, Yangzhou is declining day by day. From an economic point of view, and from an emotional point of view, it is not permissible for large kites to appear in the sky. In the past, in Yangzhou, during the March fireworks season, one could hear the sound of kites in the sky all day long, and see many red lanterns at night. Now, however, one only feels the loneliness of the sky lining the aging of Yangzhou.</p>
<p>In addition, it must be mentioned that the large centipedes in the past were best made by the Mei family village outside Guangchu Gate. The villagers made centipedes in their spare time from farming, some up to more than a hundred sections long. Every spring, there are always two or three large centipedes tied to the trees in front of the village, ready to be flown into the sky. Buyers can choose on the spot, and if they feel that one is stable, they can specify that one and negotiate the price.</p>
<p>Finally, the "Painting Boat Record" also says: "Recently, new Western-style lanterns have been made, taking the image of kites, but without using thread. The method is to use cotton paper without flaws or holes, one foot and four inches long and one foot and two inches wide, to reduce its elasticity. Attach its edges like a hub; cut bamboo strips into rings as large as the paper, and attach the paper to them. Two copper wires are interlaced and tied in the middle, and a very thin copper sheet is placed at the intersection. Walls are made of Qiao wood all around, and hemp is spread in the middle. The hemp is soaked in mature sorghum wine, and yellow and white wax, sulfur, tidal brain, and wolf dung are spread on top, and lit with fire. Let four strong people hold the paper with the side facing up that does not have a bamboo ring, and the Yan medicine rises, not letting it go from above, as large as the evening star, and it falls overnight." I used to see this occasionally in my childhood, but in recent years, not only have I not seen it again, but no one talks about it anymore.</p>
<h3>Portrait</h3>
<p>— Manet</p>
<p>Manet (E. Manet 1830-1880) was an important figure among the Impressionist artists. Impressionism was a school of painting that arose with the prosperity of science in the nineteenth century. Their main pursuit was "light" and "color." The technique advocated was quick and simple, and emphasized brushstrokes (Tauch). The subject matter was the same as that of the Realist school, absolutely unrestricted. They just particularly emphasized "light."</p>
<p>This is one of Manet's proudest works, a portrait completed in two hours with colored strokes. The colors are bright but not vulgar, and the expression is just right. (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 400</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After Elder Hou Hejian finished speaking, he immediately gave the young man two instructions. After the young man led Zheng Yan away, the elder translated the two instructions to Hejian, fearing that Hejian might misunderstand.</p>
<p>"What kind of relationship do you have with Miss Nakamura?"</p>
<p>"Miss Nakamura is a friend of a comrade of ours in Peiping. Our comrade sent a telegram stating that this lady is very sympathetic to our group's movement and therefore wishes to meet her."</p>
<p>"You probably know she is Japanese?" Hejian said with a cold smile.</p>
<p>"We know... but there are also quite a few people in your country who sympathize with our group's movement!"</p>
<p>"You probably know Miss Nakamura's position?"</p>
<p>"We only know that she is a powerful figure in your military's special affairs agency," the elder said, each word steady and deliberate.</p>
<p>"Then you still trust her?"</p>
<p>"Her actions, at least, are not harmful to us!"</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"We also have a very sound organization, and our information is very well-informed."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you know that Miss Nakamura disappeared this morning?" "This matter is a bit too unexpected," the elder raised his hand, gently stroking his sparse long beard, revealing a thoughtful expression. "We only received this news at 11 o'clock this morning..."</p>
<p>"Then, your subordinates are still waiting in the park?" Hejian's tone implied some criticism.</p>
<p>"We hope that Miss Nakamura is safe and sound; at the same time, we also want to leave this as a contingency plan to see if anything more unexpected will happen. Therefore, we did not withdraw the people from the park and ordered them to pay closer attention..."</p>
<p>"There are more than ten in total: inside and outside the park?" Hejian wanted to confirm whether his observation before getting into the car outside the park was correct.</p>
<h3>On Poetry</h3>
<p>— Polo</p>
<p>Poetry has the possibility of harmony, nature, and beautifying life; within it burns true inspiration and is filled with beautiful thoughts. Its emotion can make our spirit joyful, and its thought can irrigate our hearts; it is a song that stirs people's blood, a melody that moves people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Random Musings While Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>When I was young, I heard a story;</p>
<p>It probably happened during the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Qing Dynasty. Famine, coupled with the existing oppressive policies, left the people of several southeastern provinces unable to breathe. More than a thousand kind fishermen along the coast of eastern Zhejiang were forced to become pirates. The court repeatedly sent troops to suppress the "bandits," but unfortunately, none of them were successful. This incident actually reached the ears of the "Master of All Under Heaven." At that time, there was a clever servant, who was called the "Parent Official of the People," the county magistrate, who came up with a good idea: falsely claiming that he was acting on imperial orders to offer amnesty, guaranteeing these thousand-plus people food and clothing. This group of so-called pirates, naturally, were happy to return, having received a guarantee for their lives. They all believed that this "parent official appointed by the court" could bring them blessings.</p>
<p>How could they have known that this was a trap set by the "Parent Official"? Over a thousand heads were lost thanks to the magistrate's brilliant plan. Then, the magistrate, having been recognized for his "wit," had a smooth career, rising from a "parent" of a county to a "parent" of a prefecture, and then to… removing the blue cap and putting on a red cap.</p>
<p>At that time, a concerned person wrote two lines of poetry for the red cap of this official:</p>
<p>"Pitiable are the countless lives of the people, whose blood has dyed the red dot on the鳌头(aò tóu, the champion's name on the list of successful candidates in the highest imperial examination)."</p>
<p>This story is filled with a sense of sadness. Even now, when I think of it, it is still deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>Beneath the official robes, above the halls of power, who knows how much blood and tears of the common people there are?</p>

<h3>Freezing and Thawing</h3>
<p>— Jue Ren</p>
<p>Spring has passed, and the weather of early summer has arrived.</p>
<p>Nowadays, everything in society is inconsistent with its name and reality. Contradictory and absurd symbols are presented before people's eyes, truly too many to count. Logically speaking, the timing of nature and human affairs should be coordinated. Spring behaving like summer is certainly wrong, but spring behaving like winter is even worse. Summer has arrived, and the season of "treading on spring ice and walking on a tiger's tail" is over. There shouldn't be any more ice. "Summer insects cannot discuss ice," as the ancients said, but today there are indeed real examples because there is too much artificial ice in the summer. Even though they are "summer insects," they should be able to "discuss ice." (Everything is artificial, and not just artificial ice.)</p>
<p>Artificial ice is cold and ruthless, not only changing the climate but also changing human life. The vast wealth of Chinese rich men in foreign banks can remain unfrozen, while the cost of living for the domestic lower classes is frozen. It has been frozen since the cold weather, and it is still not thawing in the summer. This is naturally unrelated to "spring ice is thin, and human feelings are even thinner."</p>
<p>Moreover, freezing the cost of living is not the only problem. It also freezes all production industries.</p>
<p>A certain newspaper carried a special dispatch from Jingdezhen, with the headline:</p>
<p>"In the Season of Growing Grass and Flying Orioles, the Spring Kilns of Jingdezhen are Frozen."</p>
<p>The original manuscript said it well:</p>
<p>"Spring returns to the earth, and the east wind thaws the ice. This is a season of vitality. According to custom, the so-called break during the Lunar New Year is at most ten and a half days. Who would have thought that January, February, March, and April have passed, and Jingdezhen has not seen a single chimney of a porcelain kiln emitting smoke?..."</p>
<p>Why is there such a tragic scene? In a word, the spring kilns are also frozen!</p>
<p>The kiln industry is like this, and most other industries are also frozen. If we say that the reason for all this freezing is because there was ice in the past, there is certainly a reason.</p>
<p>In the "Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government: Tang Dynasty, Tian Huan Eleventh Year," Zhang Bao, a Jinshi from Shan County, said to people, "You rely on Prime Minister Yang, just like Tai You. I think of you as relying on ice. If the bright sun comes out, will you not lose what you rely on?"</p>
<p>Obviously, this iceberg has already been melted by the bright sun today. Everything should be able to thaw, whether it is life or production. But in reality, there is no sign of thawing. Has the bright sun not yet come out? We cannot help but be deeply worried about this.</p>
<h3>Sticking to One's Profession</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>Pickpocket (visiting a friend in prison)! "Today, I hired a lawyer for you, but I had to give him my watch as a retainer."</p>
<p>Friend—"Did he take it?"</p>
<p>Pickpocket—"He thinks he did."</p>
<h3>Really?</h3>
<p>Child: —What does a lawyer do, Dad?</p>
<p>Dad: —A lawyer is a person who encourages two people to take off their clothes and fight, and then he takes their clothes and leaves.</p>
<h3>Arts and Literary Circles</h3>

<p>Geng Jizhi, a translator of famous Russian literary works, passed away in Shenyang on March 2nd due to illness. Geng's friends in the Jiyang area held a "Memorial Service for Mr. Geng Jizhi" at the Guandi Temple in Xiaoxiguan on March 16th. The Shanghai Literary Association and the China-Soviet Literary Association held a public memorial service at the Jing'an Temple Buddhist Hall on Nanjing West Road on the 5th of this month. The supplements "Pen Club" and "Evening Gleanings" have published special issues, and the monthly magazine "Literary Spring and Autumn" in April and "Literary Renaissance" in May will all publish special features. It is heard that in the April issue of "Literary Spring and Autumn," there will be Zheng Zhenduo's "Biography of Mr. Geng Jizhi," Fan Quan's "In Memory of Mr. Geng Jizhi," as well as a portrait of Mr. Geng Jizhi and the manuscript of "Resurrection."</p>

<h3>Letters from Overseas</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Speaking further about the general reaction in England towards our country, it's truly hard to put into words.</p>
<p>The news from home is bad, and we are looked down upon abroad. Just talking about the present, the New Fourth Army has problems, there are riots in Taiwan, Dalian and Lushun have not yet been received, and there is a famine in western Hunan. It's truly heartbreaking. Now, England, standing in the position of an ally, is raising funds to relieve the victims of the famine in western Hunan. Posters are being put up everywhere, and each cinema is showing the conditions of the disaster in western Hunan, in order to arouse the sympathy of the general British people. In reality, how can people bear to watch it?</p>
<p>Now, we don't dare to go ashore—in our free time every day, we can take a small ferry to visit the streets. When we walk on the streets, many men, women, old, and young people point at us and discuss Chinese affairs. Sometimes, they even stop us and ask many questions that are difficult to answer at once. Therefore, even if the classmates are bored, they have to stay at home. We are now launching a fundraising campaign, and in less than three days, we have already raised over a thousand pounds. We are now discussing how to remit it back to the motherland, so that no one skims off the top and it can directly reach the hands of the refugees.</p>
<p>I still need to continue packing my luggage, so I won't write much more. Tomorrow is the first day of our Long Leave. This time, I am being sent to Carlisle, because the gentlemen of that place have sent a letter inviting the Chinese Navy to visit, and everything will be taken care of by the local gentlemen. However, I am afraid that I will encounter many accusations about Chinese issues again, but no matter what, I am still happy, because I feel that all the difficulties that China is currently encountering are precisely the phenomena that must occur before national construction.</p>
<p>Your brother, Jian (below)</p>
<h3>Li Wenzhong—Dying at the Right Time</h3>
<p>— Mu Tao</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War, although Wenzhong was no longer the Minister of Beiyang, he still held the position of Grand Scholar of the Wenhua Hall and was soon appointed as the Minister in charge of Foreign Affairs. The system of the Zongli Yamen (Office for Foreign Affairs) was also led by a prince, similar to the Grand Council. Hefei (Li Hongzhang) was old and experienced and often insisted on his own views, and even the presiding official could do nothing about it. Therefore, in Weng Songlun's diary, there are often satirical remarks, and sometimes the discussions in the central court were secretly kept from him. (The Grand Council ministers were summoned every day, but the Zongli Yamen was not.) This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Hefei was dignified and tolerant and never complained about the Eastern Dynasty. What he often discussed was that after the death of the late Minister (Zeng Guofan), there were too few people in the same position with a global perspective. After the Restoration (Tongzhi Restoration), not only was there no construction to compare with the energetic efforts of various countries to strengthen their war preparedness, but the difference was too great. In the future, diplomacy will be even more difficult to handle with a weak country. He could not help but regret it.</p>
<p>In the Wuxu year (1898), Hefei took up the post of Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi. Therefore, during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year (1900), he was able to cooperate with the two Governors, Liu and Zhang, to protect the overall situation in the Southeast. Hefei made a great contribution to the Qing Dynasty. If Hefei had still been in Beijing during the Gengzi year, he would have suffered the same fate as Xu Xu and the other officials. Therefore, if Hefei had died before the Sino-Japanese War, in his position as the Governor-General of Zhili, the public opinion would have been mixed, and his true intentions would have been difficult to understand. If he had died from a Japanese bullet, it would have been lighter than a feather. Even if he had died when he was dismissed from his post at Xianliang Temple, his overall evaluation would have been uncertain. Only when the Allied forces entered Beijing and the two palaces went on a western hunt, and he re-entered Beijing to preside over the peace talks, exhausting his efforts to extend the Qing Dynasty's life by ten years, did his loyalty to the country become clear to the world. How can we not say that he died at the right time?</p>
<h3>Distinguished Guests Fight Fire</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>A certain large hotel in New York recently caught fire. At that time, the former Dutch diplomat Baron Qiu Lin and his wife were hosting distinguished guests. Therefore, the guests present and other residents on each floor all waved portable fire extinguishers, laid water hoses, and assisted in the rescue. The Duke of Windsor, the former British king who loved the beauty more than the country, was also among them. These distinguished guests did not excessively cherish their precious lives and were actually able to brave all kinds of dangers and fight against the fire god. It is truly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>In the initial stage of the fire outbreak, before the firefighters arrived, this short moment was the most important juncture. If the people on the scene could bravely provide assistance at this time, the effect would be far greater than the work that the firefighters could do after the fire had spread. This is why the fire fighting of the distinguished guests is valuable and not just a kind of amateur appearance.</p>
<p>However, the fact that the distinguished guests condescended to fight the fire is still worth mentioning. The reason why the news agency specifically pointed it out is also because of this kind of psychology. From this, we can easily see that the Duke of Windsor's love for beauty over the country originally stemmed from his pragmatic personality. He could give up the throne for a woman and could also risk his life to fight a fire. This kind of spirit of advancing bravely and without hesitation is really not something to be ridiculed.</p>
<p>If we think carefully about this matter (the distinguished guests fighting the fire), we feel that there is another reason to be said. Imagine under this kind of situation, if it were our Chinese distinguished guests, they would probably just make a lot of noise and run around in a panic. But this is not enough to explain the inferior nature of our Chinese distinguished guests only watching the fire from across the river and not having the courage to do what is right. I say that Chinese distinguished guests and the general Chinese people all have the same compassionate heart as foreigners. They definitely do not want to see a fire and not put it out. The reason why they do not help is simply that their strength is not enough. Because our distinguished guests and the general public rarely have this kind of training that requires courage and physical strength. They have spent their lives with their hands in their sleeves. How can you expect them to bravely fight the fire at this time? Foreign distinguished guests can risk fighting the fire and not encounter danger. If it were our Chinese, they would probably lose their lives because of it. Speaking further, it would involve the entire issue of our education and social atmosphere. We are still a civilized country.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Jiufei, who hadn't said a word for half a day, had turned pale and was about to faint because she couldn't bear the torment of the heat, the crowding, and the fear. Old Zhu called her name twice, but she didn't respond.</p>
<p>"Feifei! Feifei!" Lan also immediately became anxious.</p>
<p>As soon as their strength was slightly dispersed, the ground under their feet immediately became unstable due to the bumping of the bodies. Old Huang and A Li clenched their teeth and desperately pushed outward with their fronts, but they also seemed to be unable to withstand it.</p>
<p>Old Zhu saw that the situation was not right and hurriedly handed the small leather suitcase he was carrying to Lan. At the same time, he snatched Rong'er and held her in his left hand, and with his right hand, he picked up Jiufei. He immediately gave the order to the others:</p>
<p>"Retreat! We can't get on!"</p>
<p>But it was really not easy to retreat. The five adults used almost all their strength to break through the encirclement and retreat to the open fields. Rong'er, overcome by excessive shock, just hugged the copper rabbit father tightly and trembled. Jiufei's color improved slightly, but her eyes were still blank, as if she had lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Lan threw down the suitcase in her hand and collapsed on the ground, exhausted.</p>
<p>"Nian! What should we do………?" She dragged her face with her hand, leaned on the mud that had been moistened by the night dew, and unconsciously called out the name that she had not forgotten for twelve years but had not called out again. (48)</p>
