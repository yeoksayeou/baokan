<h3>政府加強管制金融　紗花布決嚴格管理　政院例會通過兩項辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕行政院廿三日上午舉行第卅五次會議，張院長主持，通過加强金融管制辦法（全文刋二版左角），黃泛區復興局組織條例草案，成立接收敵偽逆文物審核委員會等要案，及任免案多件。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕全國花紗布管理辦法，於廿三日政院會議中通過。據悉：管理辦法內容分棉花，棉紗，棉布之管理辦法及軍需供應紗布外銷之辦法，與生產輔導原則等部分。該項辦法係由經濟部就統購·統銷·代紡·代織之原則擬定，呈請政院核定者，茲誌如次：</p>
<p>棉花管理：1.凡本會指定代紡紗廠所需棉花，概由本會按規定價格統籌收購，不得自由購買，未經指定之紗廠所需棉花，應由本會代購，或呈經本會核准給證，按照本會規定價格自行採購；2.統購棉花，由會成立或委託機構辦理；3.產棉地區棉商所收之棉花，應按本會規定價格，全部售予本會統收棉花機構，不得私自出售；4.本會指定各代紡紗廠現有存棉，應向本會報明數量，不得出售；5.各地棉花機器打包廠，一律由本會管制；6.各重要交通據點，對於棉花報關轉運，應驗憑本會所發之運轍證；７.洽購外棉，收購到埠外棉，及輸出紗布換取外棉，均由會統籌。　棉紗管理；1.本會掌握之國棉及外棉，除其他時許用途外，全部配給各紗廠代紡棉紗；2.凡紗錠數目在三千錠以上，並經本會認爲合格之紗廠，應由會指定遵照規定辦法代紡棉紗，3.代紡紗廠，應將所存周轉棉花紗，成棉，紡每件紗用棉量，定爲四五三磅，以本會現定合格之棉花爲標準，代紡工繳利潤（包括統稅等），每件二十支紗以四百五十九磅半棉花（二十支原料）爲計算之標準，依照本會規定價格，折合法幣付給之；4.代紗棉紗一律仍用各廠原有商標，惟應符合本會所定標準製品之規格，並由本會派員按期抽取紗樣，集中檢驗，按品質之優劣，予以獎懲。6.棉紗記銷，採用下列方式：（甲）凡經本會認爲具有代織資格之織廠，依代織辦法由本會供給棉紗；（乙）凡未具有代織資格之職造廠戶，在本會調查登記尙未辦理完成以前，暫由各業公會或團體，負庸晝報商廠名號，及其生產設備，實際需紗紗數量，以機核棉紗。　棉布管理1.凡具有動力織機三十合以上，或經本會認爲合格之織布廠，得向本國申請訂約共紗代職布疋，其他　製工廠，於必要時亦得參照辦理；2.配紗代織布疋及棉　品之種類，以合於國內一般人民需要及外銷；3.代　各廠，應將現存面紗所織不疋或其他棉織品繳交臉收後，再由本會換給棉紗繼續生產；4.至配紗代織布疋及棉織品，採取以紗交換爲原則，不另計工繳，但必要時得將工繳部份之棉紗，按照當時當地棉紗定價，以法幣折台之。　軍需供應，視其需要軍事機構與本會洽妥後辦理。　紗布外銷，其數量暫以不超過棉紗總生產量百分之二十爲原則，由本會統籌辦理。　生產輔導；1．各代紡紗廠應依所得代紗工繳利潤收人總額，提出百分之十，另立專戶，作爲改進基金，專供改進設備之用；2.辦理如有盈餘時，應依盈餘總額提出百分之十，作爲改進花紗工生產之用，其用途範圍由經部呈請政院就下列各項核定分配之：（甲）推廣植棉及改進棉產，（乙）改進紗織工業之試騐設備，（丙）獎勵紡織機器及配件之製造；（丁）代各紡織廠家向國外訂購必需之機器物料及配件平價配售之。</p>
<h3>五院組織法修正　行政院設十四部三委會　立院組織職權均予擴大</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕修正五院組織法，經立院廿三日上下午例會研討，已全部通過，本日會議，由孫兼院長主席，監院于院長並列席說明。五院組織法主要修正之點，爲政院各部會原定之丁四部，三委會仍舊，工商部仍維原名，郵電部取消，勞動部仍改社會部，增一糧食部，國府主計處改　政院。立院委會由十七增至十九個委會，主席改稱召集委員，人數亦自」人增爲三或五人。司法院犬法官由九人增至十七人，資格放寬，任期由原定之終身職改爲九年，最高法院行政法院等機構恢復設立。監院組織法，將原定監委分赴谷地巡迥監察，改爲監院視事實需要，得將全國分區，設監院監委行暑。考試院組織法主要修正爲：將考試委員人數自十一人增至十九人，並將考選處改爲考選部。會中並通過立院各委會組織法案與修正，立委選罷法條文案等案，下次例會廿七日舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕修正政院組織法案，立院廿三日晨例會會予討論，經對部設置熱烈辯論後，全文十七條已修正通過，決議工商部仍稱工商部，郵電部取消，勞動部則改稱社會部，原案之工八個部會改爲十七個部會，惟最後樓桐孫秘書長又臨時宣讀國府來令，謂政院呈請將目前國府主計處，改爲主計部，改隸政院，該案下午於立院提出覆議，關於政院所提請加主計部一點，當時有人建讀將其列於糧食部之後，惟亦有認主計處無庸改部，同時，主計處長亦不必爲政務委員，孫兼院長更提出英·美例證，說明外國主計處爲財政部之一部門，我不必另行設部，主計長亦不必與內閣同進退，決議再修改政院組織法，將第五條改爲「行政院設主計處，新聞局，其一組織以法律定之」。（政院組織法全文刋左角）</p>
<h3>立法院提案　分政府及委員兩種</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕修正立院組織法，經立院廿三日上下午討論，業已通過，其主要之點爲委員會原有之十七個增至十九個，各委會原各設主席一人，現改爲置召集委員三人或五人，並各增專門委員一至三人，提案手續亦分爲政府提案及委員提案兩種，以示區別。孫兼院長廿三日晨於立院例會中，說明修正立院組織法之要點稱；行憲後之立院，職權利織皆將擴大，以後一切國家施政方針及政策，咸須先經提出立院討論，因之，其重要性絕非目前立院所能比擬。此次修改組織法，增加若干委會，此係按照政院各部會而設置，期使行政，立法間更能配合，至立院重要議事規則所以列入立院組織法者，以立院主要工作即在開會，議事規則之重要者，應列入組織法之中。新修正中另一要點爲將來提案方式，新規定依參酌英美兩國之長，即政府及委員咸可提案，惟爲防止委員提案過濫，因之，委員提案須先提出院會討論。又未來委會將各設召集委員三人至五人，此與黨派合作有關，蓋我國將來將無所謂少數黨，多數然，參政之政黨皆將爲政府黨，有三至五召集委員，遇有軍要問題，意志得於事先溝通，可免隔閱。</p>
<h3>大法官增多　任期九年　考試院考選處改部</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕修正司法院組織法，修正考試院組織法兩案，立院廿三日午後例會中通過。前者修正最大者，爲大法官部份及各級法院部份，關於大法官原組織法規定爲九人，現增至十七人，其資格原組織法無規定，現規定應具左列資格：甲，曾任最高法院推事十年以上者。乙，曾任立委九年以上者。丙，會任大學法律學主要科目敎授十年以上者。丁，曾任國際法庭法官或有公法學或比較法學之權威著作者。戊，硏究法學富有政治經驗，聲譽著者，並定其任期爲五年。會中討論時，陳茹玄主張大法官應爲終身職，俾能超然獨立，不爲政潮所左右。趙珮，簡貫三反對戊項資格，認富有政治經驗者，亦得任大法官，易使不學無術濫竽充數。戴修駿等則爲友黨開方便之門，結果大法官任期仍定爲九年，戊項資格亦保留。關於各級法院原組織法，僅規定司法院分設民事庭，刑事庭，行政裁判庭及公務員懲戒委會，修正後恢復現行制度，仍設最高法院，行政法院公務員懲戒委會。修正考試院組織法主要者，爲考試委員增至十九人，並將原組織法考選處改爲考選部。</p>
<h3>台幣法幣匯率　改為一比九十</h3>

<h3>王外長在政院報告　美進行援華工作　蘇聯改革幣制效果未嘉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政務愈議廿三日是舉行時，外長王世木報告外交稱：美援華工作正進行中，最近美國會通過撥一千八百萬美元，作臨時援助，顯示美對我之關懷，以後可有更多之撥助。關於蘇聯幣制改革問題，王氏說明我已獲駐外使節之報告，惟此次改革效果不甚佳，新幣尙不能十足兌現，約爲三折，蘇人民以此頗受換失。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿三日電）國代當選人，彙報選總者，截至廿三日止，共達二千零數十人，已逾國代總額三分之二，選總即日將此項結果呈報國府，俾國府於十二月廿五日頒布國大召集令。又選總發言人廿三日談稱：行憲國代選舉工作，自選總規定進行程序後，各級選與機關按照程序積極進行至十二月廿三日止，依照選罷法規定辦理之各省市，均已如期舉行投票普選，所有選舉結果，各縣市或同等區域主管選所已先後這選總備查，但以地方交通不便，若干地區不但電訊不通，即郵局亦未設立，故遞報需時而全省性及全國性職婦團體之選舉，復須彙計全省或全國各地選票，以定當選及候補次序，故截至廿三日止，報選總者始達二千餘人，其餘尙在陸讀呈報中。至適用補充條例之各省市選舉，聞正在積極辦理，不久亦可全部選出。</p>
<h3>調整特遇問題　簽請主席核示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕廿三日是立院例會，原定請政院張院長列席，說明調整公務員待遇問題，後政院諮文：大意謂，關於調整公務員待遇事，已由五院代表所組織之委會擬有方案，現正簽請主席核示中，內容如何政院尚未明晰，無法向立院說明。</p>

<h3>羅卓英談匪鑽隙受創　瀋陽危機已漸减　國軍即對匪展開殲滅戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿三日電〕東北行轅副主任羅卓英稱：共匪此次竄擾，鑒於國軍兵力雄厚，戒備週密，避免向「大點」攻堅，而從事於「鑽隙」竄擾。渠謂：匪由法庫方面一路「鑚隙」南下，企圖向潘陽進襲，殊未料在「小點」法後所（法庫東南）一役遭受重創。匪幾致完全覆沒，嗣在石佛寺（瀋北）再遛國軍擊潰，故潘陽之危機已漸减輕。羅氏根據匪近來竄動情形，指出遼西將有大規模會戰，彰武一帶匪軍可能南下竄犯錦州，至新民亦爲戰事重點之一。羅氏表示：各地國軍均已部署就緒，一俟時機成熟，即可對匪展開大殲滅戰。</p>

<h3>社論　戰前銀行存款淸償辦法</h3>
<p>戰前存款應如何償還一事，各方爭論已久，根據復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條之規定，法院雖得爲增減給付之判決，介也只是一個原則，並沒有數字上明確與劃一的標準。試觀去年冬間，自上海地方法院對於陳季琳與四行儲蓄會上海分會涉訟一案，經判決爲增加一千倍給付以來，各地的判例多寡不一，自八百倍，一千二百倍，一千五百倍，五千倍至一萬倍不等。本年夏間，崇明地方法院曾判決，戰前四百元之借款，應償還　米二十石，按照當時米價預算，已高達二萬五千倍左右。故司法上的救濟手段，並不能解決是　　紛。相反地，因假執行的請求，反引起債權人方面的抗義。司法行政部因而指示，凡被告預供担保，或將請求之標的物提存時，　免爲假執行。又財政部爲避免增加　紛起見，　　商請司法部，通令各級法院，在政府未將戰前存款償還辦法明令頒佈以前，暫勿自行判決。可知這個問題的根本解決，不得不進一步，有賴於立法上的持平處置了。</p>
<p>現在是項辦法，即銀行業戰前存款放款淸償條例，已經産法院通過，其全文刊載昨日本報。其要點如次：　將所謂戰前，劃分爲兩個時期，一爲　正戰前，即廿六年八月十三日以前之存放本息，依一，七〇三，四六二倍償還，二爲對日宣戰前以前，即自廿六年八月十四日起至卅年十二月九日之存放款，逐月計算本息，自一，六八二，四三二倍至七〇〇，六七〇倍不等，　五百萬元以上之債款，得分期付還；　活期存款之餘額，其利息折半計算；　國家行局對於公務機關之放款，公務機關及銀錢業在國家行局之存款，仍照原約辦理；　此後銀行業存放款之淸償，不適用復　後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條之規定；而所謂存款一項，且明白規定，包　普通，備　，信托等各種存款在內。是此項　紛，至此已可得一合法與明白解決的途徑，洵堪　幸。</p>
<p>這在　　人與債人兩方面看來，其觀感當然是不同的。因爲淪陷地帶，銀行存款，經過折半兌換與二百兌一的兩重損失以後，據算戰前存款千元，所存不過兩元五角。則以一，七〇三·四六二倍計算，形式上須以六八一，四六四倍償還，他們當然要高呼大吃其虧。而在存戶方面，則以物價高漲，即幣值低落之結果，其吃虧亦不謂小。據中國經濟研究所所編上海批發物價指數表，以廿五年作爲一，廿六年爲一·一，而本月第二週已高至一三二，三六七；則最近指數，已比廿六年高超十二萬餘倍。而今貨幣上之所得，不過一千七百餘倍，其損失自　不輕。即以上海工人生活　指數而論，以廿五年作爲一，廿六年爲八三·九八，而本年十一月已高至六一，七〇〇，實際漲起了七萬三千一百餘倍，比一千七百餘倍亦相差得甚遠。誠如立院財政委員會劉君所說：「戰時雙方均蒙受損失」，「舍此而外，難謀得更佳方案」，只得「雙方兼顧」，以期及早解決了。</p>
<p>這　所要指出的，卻有以下三點：其一爲公債如何還本付息問題，原條例第八條載明：「銀錢業在國家行局之存款，其利息仍照原約規定」。這與公　雖無直接關係，但銀錢業在國家行局之存款，曁不適用本條例，則一般公　持有人所希望之若干倍償還辦法，事實上恐屬不可能。其二爲私人間的債務，本條例並未有　及；自只有訴諸司法，仍照民訴補充條例第十二條辦理。但以立法上　有先例，此後自由裁量之結束，當不至如從前之參差，是間接的亦可受到本條例良好的影響。其三爲戰時與戰後的存款問題，這與本條例自無干涉。　其名稱本限於戰前的存款，而自卅年十二月九日對日宣戰以後，法幣貶值的形勢已顯，各種定期存款，事實上已屬甚少之故。我們現在所以聯帶地提到這個問題，就因為定存固　甚少，而活存亦相對地激減。有人估計，現在各行莊存款的總數，　以　前的幣值，還不到十分之一。以致所有各地的餘剩資金，一齊流向地下錢莊投機市場，造成了物價空前的漲風，與囤積居　的狂熱。此種趨勢，如不從獎勵儲蓄，導游資於生產入手，則所有其他各種治標的手段，在最後，終必證明爲無效。但要使人樂於儲蓄，將游資變爲存款，則如何還本付息，便是主要的問題。換句話說：如何保全幣值，使存戶不受無形中貶值的損失，又如何提高存息，使他們不至於吃虧，這　是調節金融，疏導游資的切實辦法，也是取締囤積和抑平物價的有效措施。</p>
<p>現在因爲經濟上的情形太混亂了，對於這種根本上的措施，大家未　　及，而只知怱怱忙忙地從事於捨本逐末的補救，例如限制匯款，（並有限制運鈔的傳說）限制貸借等辦法。急則治標，在當局自有其不得已的苦衷。但以限制過嚴之故，將使一切通貨，愈益逃避行莊，而奔注於地下式的流通與拆放，則其結果，當然是游資愈多，投機愈盛，而管制亦愈困難，僅此治標式的補救，亦未必能達到其最初的願望；這與我們所期望的獎勵儲蓄，導游資於生產，未免相去過遠了。我們也知道：所謂獎進儲蓄，導入生產，在這通貨膨脹之下，　術上甚爲困難。但從戰前存款淸償辦法上所得痛苦的　騐，我們固不願見此等現象，或以某種方式，重演於將來，尤不願見一印餘剩資金，逃避行莊，而悉成爲眞正的游資。</p>

<h3>美參院外交委員會　將聆取援歐意見　貝爾納斯等均被邀出席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿三日廣播：華盛頓訊，據悉，美參院外委會一月七日討論杜杜當門總統之長期援歡計劃時，許多重耍人物將出席作證，包括前國務卿貝爾納斯，前租借法執行人克勞萊，前駐英大使凱尼第以及羅斯福內閣閣員及反對對英偕款最激烈之瓊斯在內牽涉問題之盧泛，在美國會歷史上所僅見。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕國會於討論馬歇爾援助計劃之際，將對美國之公共生活及意見展開最大規模之調查。參院外交委員會定一月七日開始聆取關於馬歇爾方案之意見，被邀陳述意見者有前國務卿貝爾納斯及史汀生，前租借法案專員克勞萊，前駐英大使甘納第，前羅斯福內閣閣員，對英貸款之敵之　斯等。其他可能列席陳述意見者，將有產業職工大會會長茂萊，美國勞工協會會長格林及美國工商農業之代表。國會觀察家預料參衆兩院最後通過之援助方案，將有重大歧異之點。</p>
<h3>史汀生柏德逊　發動援歐運動　以减少任何阻企圖</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕美國有聲望公民會組之委員會「馬歇爾援歐復興計劃委員會」，今日在此發動運動，以抗國會减少援助額或阻撓援助計劉通過之任何企圖。該委員會由前陸長史汀生，柏德遜，前副國務卿艾克遜等領導。艾克遜今日在記者招待會中聲稱，社魯門總統要求之最初十五個月內之援助額六十八億元，若予减少，必致牽動整個計劃。巴黎三十六國會議若能重開以決定互助之細則，使國會預先得以知悉援助目標之得獲成功，當極爲有助。艾克遜反對以一年爲一期討論援歐計劃之議，並反對附帶任何政治條件。渠覺大部份之援助金錢，應作爲贈與而非貸給，若要求歐洲國家以黃金等抵押，乃至愚之舉。蓋一方面協助歐洲增產，一方面則令其償還鉅額美元債務，將引起更困難的平衡支付問題。</p>
<h3>杜魯門簽署　緊急援歐方案</h3>

<h3>依據四強協商方式　解決德迫切問題　克萊表示願作再度嘗試</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿二日電〕德境美軍總司令克萊將軍談稱，美當局當再從事一次嘗試，俾依四强基礎解決德國最急迫之問題，如果失敗，則美英當局將採取任何可能的步驟，使德國西部之經濟得以保特前進，幣制改革。銀行制度。及物資之交換，均爲必須即時考慮即時解決之問題。</p>
<p>渠不以爲倫敦會議之失敗，已造成在德國之新局勢，不過使　局勢延長而已。今爲加强經濟合併起見，當採取任何必需步驟。克萊並日，渠於假期後不久，將與英軍區長官羅勃遜將軍晤談，硏究阻碍德國復興之因素。</p>
<p>政治合併須視民意</p>
<p>渠並曰關於與任何地區從事政治合併，目前尙無決議，此項決議須待以四强基礎解決德國問題之最後嘗試失敗後始進行。克萊並鄭重否認美國將退出柏林之說，復曰，給予兩區德國機構以更大職權之計劃，將繼續施行，或將予德當局以審判遠背經濟法令者之權，且將給予若千德國機構，尤其是海關等以警察權。克萊繼曰，就原則上言，吾人在戰區設立政治機構以前，須微求德人意見，然他處之政府性行動，可能迫使英美原當局在得意徵求德人意見前，即行建立此等政治機構。英美區德國經濟委會之決議，對於德人意思之決定，有重大影嚮。德人民目前極願避免若英美區政治合併等之行動。克萊並力言，政治合併並非不能收回之行動，關於六千五百萬人民之任何行動，均非不能收回者，渠決不在德國之任何部份，建立非德人所願之政府。</p>

<h3>推行援歐計劃的新機構　執掌物資分配採購的大權（本報編譯室譯）</h3>
<p>爲了實施馬歇爾計劃，美國政府可能要買進和賣出價値達數十億美元的物資，來供給西歐。若干政府行政要員和商思顧問，正在草擬美國援助歐洲的公式。美國政府勢必設立一個新機關，來辦理這椿工作，並須由法律加以承認，直接向國會負責。刻在華盛頓和紐約草擬實施馬歇爾計劃辦法的美國專家們，對於這個機構的組織方式，已有相當淸楚的一個概念。</p>
<p>在美國方面，這個機構應該有兩椿任務：第一，它必須決定美國的金錢和貨物應該怎樣分配；第二，它必須購進援助計劃中所必要的物資，並保證它們運達目的地。在美國政府中，這兩椿工作一椿是分配，一椿是採購。</p>
<p>在分配方面，美國政府是有辦法的。出口管制雖將於明年三月間結束，但是總統一定會要求國會加以延長，甚至予以擴大。</p>
<p>關於分配的問題，有下列數端：</p>
<p>第一，必須有人決定美國貨物在國內和國外的需要。起初美國希望僅拿「可以省出來的東西」運出去，後來發現可以省下來的東西爲數頗少。第二，在決定出口多少之後，必須再決定其中究竟應該有多少輸往包括在馬歇爾計劃內的地區，另有多少輸往其他地區，如拉丁美洲和遠東等地。</p>
<p>在這些事情辦妥之後，再要把規定數量的物資，分配給包括在馬歇爾計劃內的歐洲十大國和德國西部。同時還要根據需要迫切的程度，來決定那幾個應有獲得援助的優先權。</p>
<p>爲了要獲得批物資，這大多數專家都同意美國政府必須親自來辦理採購工作，至少應該加以統制。有些人希望由若干有經驗的商人組織一個委員會，來代理政府的採購工作，另有些人主張由政府中現已存在的一個機會來負責辦理。有些人希望由政府若干機關分推代表組織一個聯合委員會，也有人主張設立一個新機關專司其事。</p>
<p>在歐洲方面也需要設立一個新機構來協助推行馬歇爾計劃。大多數人主張由戰時各盟邦組織一個聯合委員會負責辦理。</p>
<p>這個委員會應由參加馬歇爾計劃的十六國和美國分別推定代表組成，它的任務，是在決定參加各國的需要，愼重地加以考慮，使供應的能力和需要相平衡，然後再決定分配的辦法。但是最後的決定權仍將屬諸美國的分配機構。</p>
<p>負責推行馬歇爾計劃的機構，正由杜魯門總統出命的對外援助委員會（該委會主席是商長哈里曼）草擬組織大綱。另由參議員福萊脫領導的一個小組委員會則集中注意於該機構的行政問題。</p>
<p>當前美國政府官吏所面臨的一個最大難題，就是美國怎樣可以充分統制對歐洲各國的援助，而又不致有控制歐洲各國政府的嫌疑。</p>

<h3>卅八年前在滬謀食　今成美國歌舞大王　凱洛率女台柱重遊舊地</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼齊格菲後世界最聞名之美歌舞大王凱洛（Earl　Carroll），於前日下午六時偕其歌舞團中台柱華萊士（BerylWallace）小姐，由美經香港抵滬。凱等此來係乘假期至中國及日本採辦舞台用品及歌舞團員所用衣飾等物，將於今晨離滬，乘機前往東京。渠等此次將在好萊塢演出也。</p>
<p>凱氏與華小姐於昨日下午在華　飯店接見本報記者，敍述其三十八年前來滬情形及渠經營歌舞團成功史，頗饒興趣。</p>
<p>凱氏生於美國畢芝堡，十歲時，在一家戲院裹當分發節目單「小郎」。如此五年，對於歌舞劇遂有極深印象和興趣。當十六歲那年，他到馬尼刺去，在一條輪船上當「小郎」。後來又到香港，在出版「中國行名錄」的公司內担任辦事員。</p>
<p>一元角來到上海</p>
<p>一九〇九年隻身來到上海，身邊只帶了一只照相機，獨自在馬路上走，忽然看到一家呌「沙利文」的照相館，他就是進去吿訴鋪子裏的人說他會照相，要求找個職業。那照相館把他收留下來，凱洛在那舖子樓下小房間內睡了三天。那時他口袋內僅有銀幣一元七角。他有一個船上的朋友，忽來介紹他到英美烟草公司做小職員。工作是專門替公司把美金或英鎊所算成銀元。同時還替公司裏海關去繳納烟葉的進口稅。那時已賺到一百銀元一月了。凱洛至今還記得他那時常常擺渡到浦東棧房去，還問記者現在棧房有沒有。人外傳我在上海海關內做過事，那是不確的，我從未在海關內任職」。凱氏向記者特別聲明。</p>
<p>美歌舞業大王安爾凱洛及其歌舞團台柱華萊士小姐合影（本報攝）</p>
<p>重返美國歌舞起家</p>
<p>當時他在上海躭權三個月，重回到美國去。因爲小時候在戲院內受到歌舞表演的影嚮，所以回國後即開始在報紙上寫作歌曲和劇本。直到一九一七年，參加大戰當士兵。戰後繼續續再寫歌曲劇本並在紐約監製歌舞劇。一九二一年在紐約建造他第一座戲院，那時他還只二十七歲。凱洛監製了六十部歌舞劇後，就搬到好萊塢去，又造了一個戲院乘餐館，那便是名震全美的「安爾·凱洛大戲院」，是美國唯一的特殊戲院，顧客們一面可以吃飯，一面可以　戲，像舞台上做的一樣。所有歌舞均稱「安爾·凱洛萬花筒」。這戲院並且還是一個大廣播電台，盛響遍全球。歌舞團中現有六十位女郎，二十二個主角，職員一共四百人。他的歌舞團曾替派拉蒙。二十世紀。麗斯等三影片公司拍過影片。</p>
<p>團中女郎個個美麗</p>
<p>安爾凱洛歌舞團中的女郎都是美國聞名最美麗最漂亮的。凱氏告訴記者，「當初我辦歌舞團時，人都以爲齊格菲歌舞團女郎漂亮，但我認爲其中確有很美麗的，但並不是個個曰都美麗，因此我就另創一格，凡入我歌舞團的，必須是頂美麗漂亮的。我們不管她是不是會跳舞會唱歌，祗要她生得漂亮，就留用她，再加訓練。所定標準很高。」講到他選擇美女的標準，凱氏說，面貌和身段都很重要，但身段尤其重要。因爲美貌可以用各種方法化裝或改造。「本來沒有一個人是眞正十全十美的美人，都得靠化裝」。但身段是無法改造的。他團裏女郎們的年齡是從十八歲起，一直到她不再漂亮時才停　。</p>
<p>香檳艷浴哄動全美</p>
<p>十年以前，凱氏因爲想出以香檳酒爲歌舞女郎艷浴而洪動全美，終因　妨害風化罪名而被拘捕。問起關於艷浴的事，凱氏說：「當初編這一幕職是因爲讀了淸朝西太后小說，假借西太后將珍妃抑斃井內的故事而想出來的。那時並沒有料到會引起大家的注意」。</p>
<p>戰前，他們會來華買了些藤回去做女演員裙內的架子，又買了農夫的笠帽，漆上顏色做裝飾。這次凱洛想買些衣料，却發現以前的許多種類綑緞，現在都沒有了。不過他昨天還是買了些共他的衣料。凱洛還說，記得有個禮查飯店。但當他昨天去贛覓時，他說已找不到了。女演員華萊士小姐對上海還說不出有什麼印象，只是頻頻稱道「喜臨門」的晚餐。</p>

<h3>南洋各地歡迎國產棉布　運銷前途極有希望　中國銀行並準廠商低利押款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據新加坡中國國貨聯發公司來人該：我國花布色在十二磅細布等，近來在南洋一帶之銷路奇暢。其中如新加坡，檳　嶼，荷印各島等地，以華僑集中，銷塲尤廣。月銷一百萬至二百萬　並非難事。紡建公司首批在菲島試銷之棉布，成績亦佳。據佔計：如運銷及匯兌貿易各項情形正常，則月銷可達四百萬碼以上。聞南洋各地中國銀行，對國產布疋之運銷南洋，已予各運銷廠商，以資金融通之方便，到貨准予低利押款，對國貨布疋之鵬銷南洋，又多一助力。再南洋各地，戰前多習用日產棉布。而產製該項日貨之織廠，刻大多歸併於我中國紡建公司，經接收整理，力求改進，產品較戰前日貨，實有過之無不及。故行銷南洋各地，備受歡迎。惟目前南銷布疋，在承銷當地，咸感幅度太窄。　普通門面，均在二十八吋左右。而南洋各地所需之布疋幅度，約需三十六吋。紡建公司刻正擬積極改組闊幅布疋，以應實銷。</p>
<p>又外間一再傳聞，近有大批日產棉布，運銷南洋，予我國棉布之南銷，以致命之打擊。茲據該來人談：日產棉布刻銷南洋者，僅限於盟軍意部與英政府　於易貨之一部份，故數量甚少。該項易貨之日很產棉布，唯一有利條件，即匯率係照項美官價匯軌計算，每英鎊合美金四元〇二分。而我國南銷棉布之匯率計算，照目前匯率言，折合為每英鎊合美金三元三角餘。故在匯率之折算上言，對我棉布之外銷，不無吃虧。惟所幸日貨數量不多，且品質亦不及我國棉布上乘。如國我匯率政策能隨機運用，將來即日貨大宗外銷，（在短期內實不可能），我國棉布仍能與之爭一日之短長云。</p>
<h3>華股猛烈回漲　永紗出五百關　六一期遞交年內開做</h3>

<p>是開時仍疲，永紗現遞開盤形成倒掛，即交開四六七元，遞交開四六五元。上塲時徘徊不定，英匯掛高，遞交先見四七〇元。嗣現遞又同告跌至四六〇元低價。堪外息價開低少許，爲三角及三角四分半，而後見定。塲外喊價又復高過塲內遞交甚多，大戶有買，即告拉上。逐漸盤高，幷有遞交可以過渡年假之傳，升至四七五元及四七六元。某帮在塲外補空，大戶跟進，美亞等小股激昻異常，近午漲到四八一元及四八四元高價。而後以四七七元及四八三元之價收市。結果較前收即交股計美亞新光景福勸興各升半成，永公跌半成，巾紡平平，餘者升降互微。遞交股計華豐微降，新光景福勤與各漲半成，餘均微升。</p>
<p>後市遞交　例停做，上塲即秀，惟開後逢高有賣，退至四八三元。國行　進仍巨，退至四八五元。此後年內加做六一期遞交之通告，業已公布，人氣如沸。美亞更見激昻，由三二號掛漲停，勤與在臨收時掛漲停，永紗哄出五百大關，達五〇五元新高價，塲外且不止此。而後以五〇一元之價收市。結果較是收計即交股美亞勤典漲停，華豐中絲新光中法商務統益各升一成左右，永紗閘北華新信和火柴景福永公麗安景福內衣各漲半成光景，餘均小升。遞交股計半天交易，塲外各老股南洋漲一成，大生好半成，餘均平穩。</p>
<p>銀行決算期，證交市塲自十二月二十九日後市起，至明年一月四日止，暫停交易。</p>
<p>第六一期遞交，自十二月二十九日前市開做，明年一月六日週二辦理交割。</p>

<p>外股昨亦回好，後市更為俏利怡紗晨開三九〇〇〇○元，後市羅進至四二五〇〇〇元收市。證券帮錢兌業有供，廣帮洋行帮有買，結果較前收計航業祥泰微升，會德豐怡啤　植英楂華各升一成有零，恰紗英聯業廣紙版鋼業電車電話藍格志各升半成。</p>
<h3>英匯提高</h3>

<h3>加強金融管理　金管切實執行</h3>

<h3>米價繼漲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米一萬四千七百餘石，產區逐步高翔，市勢　續上揚。粳秈元米一致步砌二三萬元，臨收消化略見淸淡。麵粉早市　升，午時見懈。麩皮漲無止境，扶搖直上，突破卅萬大關·豆餅客帮略動，黃豆動而不爽，油廠揀巧拾取，本　納胃平平，交易不多，價格微升三五千至萬元不一。茶豆　呆少神，並無成交。赤豆去化仍淡，豇豆油頭動辦，形勢活玲。</p>
<p>紅糧存到兩少，高而愈固。苞米北洋續辦，市况堅定。生仁廣帮本街相繼收購，高貨提升二三萬元，中次相仿。芝蔴去化尙可，奶蔴見升一二萬元，黑蔴白蔴均少上落，黃蔴亦無　　。</p>
<p>油市繼續上升，豆油再加三五萬元，菜蔴油步漲三四萬元，　油亦漲五六萬元，生油帶起二三萬元。　幫略有問津。</p>
<h3>紗布均疲</h3>
<p>棉紗市况爲因年關日近，銀根緊迫，客帮去化呆滯，本街實銷亦淸，買戶進取甚少，浮戶吐售仍多，行情紛皇下游，尤以二十支粗紗跌勢較勁。細紗臨收時稍有交易，喊價　　。迨至最後四十二支藍鳳細紗比上日微挫四十萬，爲四千七百萬元。二十支及十六支各級粗紗軋跌自一·二十萬至一百二十萬元不一。</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開因銀根依然緊縮，多頭吐售仍衆，各路實銷不動，更有山西帮吐出龍頭細布七十八件，同時散空　壓，行情一蹶不振。迨至午收時，山西帮對四君子　　　進甚多，故結果　　　上日軋跌九千至一萬二·三千元，十二磅龍頭等各細布步瀉四·五千至一·二萬元，全日趨勢惟藍布及士林布脚地較硬外，其餘各布市，均疲軟無神。</p>

<h3>中國銀行發表　十月份僑匯數字　財部將取締華南民信店</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行頃發表十月份經收之僑匯數字，共計國幣三四，六一六，九七四，四五八·六四元。各地之數額如下：紐約二二，四一八，九七〇，一八四元；倫敦二，九〇六，〇八六，八九六·三七元；哈伐那一，四九九，二五七，〇〇〇元；雪梨一九五，四四八，七一六元，加爾各答二六一，九二六，八四三元；仰光八六〇，二六五，〇〇〇元；新加坡三四，二二〇，〇〇〇元；柯拉倫擺二三，五〇○，〇〇〇元；檳榔嶼五一，一七九，九九〇元；西貢四九，一六〇，五二八。五二元；巴達維亞五，六九二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元；其他各地六二四，九五九，三〇〇；十一月份之僑匯數字，不日亦將結出，因黑市日長，故尙不及十月份。財部及國行現爲縮小僑匯走私之領域起見，將設法取締盛行於華南之「民信店」，投此種組織性質原爲郵遞，淸代中葉已有，淸末民初更盛行，因華僑早年帶信回國時，信丙往往夾帶外幣，習以爲常，至於今日，遂成爲僑匯走私之重要途徑。惟因此類民信店，並無一定之形式與組織，亦無一定手續，一切全憑個人間之信任，故頗有流弊。最近有數家民信店突告倒閉，南洋華僑頗有損失。</p>
<h3>人民攜帶金鈔　金管並未取締　但不許有交易行為</h3>

<h3>全經會秘書長長來滬　商討紙張增產問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全經會副秘書長顧　瑔前日由京抵滬，午後四時假中央工業試騐所召開會議，商討我國紙張增產之技術問題。工商輔導處化工組長陳陶心及紙業代表金潤庠金　劉季　林　達等十餘人列席。討論結果，決定我　明年決生產報紙三萬五千噸，由各區公會負責辦理。毛毯銅絲布因國達品之　　較差，一方面限制進口，並積極建廠自造，由造紙器材供應委員會負責　辦。會中紙業代表請求將政府收購自備外匯貨物中之木漿，分配於現有之造紙廠家，自第五季起實行。以上各點推定陳陶心（召集人）林厥達陳彭年錢子寅等祥加商討，並與全經會隨時取得密切聯繫，以期早達增產目的。又台南木　廠，俟與糖業公司洽　完成，取得蔗渣之供給後，每日可生產木漿四十噸，因我國目前造紙原料缺乏，故此舉如成事實，則與我國造紙業貢獻甚巨。至於紙張增產之費用問題，則據專家之意見，在此方案之下，產量提高，而外匯反可節省，故實爲富有建設性之方案。</p>
<h3>本年未贖箱茶　農行定下週標售</h3>

<h3>兩個嬰兒</h3>
<p>— 阿剌伯K·紀伯蘭作　施蟄存譯</p>
<p>一位王子立在他的皇宮的露臺上，對着一大　爲了這個盛典而召集　來的民衆致辭，他說，「讓我對你們以及這整個的幸運的國家道喜，因爲一個新的王子誕生了，他將承襲我的尊貴的家庭底名字，你們將來會很公平地以他爲誇傲。他是一個名門大族底新的嗣續，在他身上嵯　着個國家底光輝的前程。唱歌呀，高興呀，」於是羣衆的聲音，充滿着歡欣與感恩，以興奮的歌聲洋溢於天空，歡迎著這位新的暴君，他將用慘酷的權威統治那些弱者，消竭也門底體力，虐殺他們底靈魂，而在他們底項頭上安置了壓迫之　。爲了這個命運，這些人民在那兒如醉如癡地狂歌痛飲，給這位新的伊彌兒（阿刺伯酋長之尊稱——譯者）祝賀健康。</p>
<p>同時，另外有一個嬰見踏進了人生與那個國家。當那些羣衆正在以歌頌一個將來的暴君而使强者愈形光耀而使他們自已更顯得渺小的時候，當天使們正在哀泣人民底懦弱與奴性的時候，一個生病的女人正在沉思。她住在一個老舊的，荒僻的茅屋裏，而且，躺在她那堅硬的床上，在一個裏着破布的襁褓的新生嬰兒旁邊，正是餓得要死了。她是一個被人們所忘却了的貧窮而　憐的靑年妻子；她的丈夫已經跌落在那個王子底壓迫所安置的死的陷阱裏去了，留下了一個孤獨的女人，在這個夜晚，上帝送給她一個小小的伴侶，以阻止她工作和支持生命。</p>
<p>當群衆散盡，四周又歸於寂靜的時候，這個苦命的女人把那嬰兒放在她底膝上，看着　底臉，哭泣着，仿彿她要用眼淚給　舉行洗禮。然後用她那被　餓所衰弱了的聲音對這孩子說，「你爲什麼離開了那個精神的世界，而來這裏分受我的人間生活底苦難呢？你爲什麼拋撇下那些天使們和空闊的天庭而來到這個可憐的，充滿了苦惱，壓迫和殘忍的人間世呢？除了眼淚之外，我一點東西也沒得給你；你願意靠着眼淚而不靠乳汁來養育碼？我沒有綢衣給你穿著；我的顫抖的赤裸的臂膊會給你溫暖嗎？那些小小的牲口在牧塲上吃了草都安全地回到牠們底欄舍裏去了；那些小小的烏啄食了　子都和平地睡在樹枝間了。但是你，我的兒呀，除了一個愛着，然而是很窮苦的母親以外，是什麼也沒有的。」</p>
<p>於是她把那嬰兒放在她那萎瘦的胸前，把她底臂膊圍抱着牠，好像要使兩個身體仍如以前一樣地合而爲一。她慢慢地抬起她那火炎的眼睛對着天，呌着『上帝啊！憐惜憐惜我的不幸的國人罷！』</p>
<p>在這一剎那間，雲都從月亮面前　散了，月光射進了那可憐的屋子底門楣上的小窗，照在兩具屍體上。　　喀列爾·紀伯蘭（Kahm　Gibran　1888-1931)是阿刺伯詩人及畫家，大彫刻家羅丹曾喻之爲規代的勃萊克。在歐洲與南美洲，也常常被譽為二十世紀的但丁，而在阿刺伯年靑詩人心目中，他却是一位可愛的大師。他的作品有「先知」（有冰心女士譯本）「先驅者」（有沈澤民選譯數則，載文學週報），「瘋人」（有中譯本，北新書局出版，譯人偶不憶），皆散文詩集。譯者會於紀伯蘭逝世後作小文介紹之，收在拙著「燈下集」中。今年又購得新出英譯「淚與笑」，凡詩與散文三十篇，本文即自此書轉譯。三十六年十二月十五日整存記</p>
<h3>霞光之畫</h3>
<p>— 倪貽德</p>
<p>最近在藝專的敎授作品展中，看到了呂霞光先生的兩幅近作，一幅是描爲靈隱大　，全幅的調子是沉鬱而莊重，在薄暗的　團中，射入幾絲偌的光綫，照在三尊金色的佛像上，發出幾點閃爍的光輝，在地上行動著的僧侶們的渺小，更顯出東方寺院建築的崇高偉大。另一幅是描寫三潭印月，古靜靜的波光中，　立着古老的三潭，近處的湖水起着漣漪，背景是一列蒼茫的遠山，天空中浮着淡淡的薄雲，表現出一種湖上晚秋的靜穆之感。</p>
<p>從這兩幅作品中，可以知道呂先生是在努力以西洋畫的寫實的技巧，來表現中國風的精趣、他的作風是屬於忠實地作客觀描寫的寫實主義的，不求誇張新奇，只是平易地親切地描寫他所看到的周圍的一切，而在這種穩健的表現中，顯出化方廣大平原上的敦厚質樸的民族氣質。</p>
<p>在目前中國的西洋畫上的重要的問題，並不在技巧上的新舊之爭，而是在如何應用西畫的寫實的技巧來表現中國的民族精神和地方色彩，這樣才能脫離西洋的模倣而創造足以代表中國民族性的藝術來。所以呂先生的這種繪畫上的傾向，是值得我們重視的。</p>

<p>今年春天，蘇聯爲了舉行詩人普希金（Alex－ander　Pushkin）逝世一百十年紀念，曾經在莫斯科·列寗格勒和別的城市裏開過紀念會和展覽會，郵電局還發行了一種特殊的紀念郵票。直到現在，普希金仍舊是蘇聯人讀得最多的一位作家。從一九一七到一九四七，他的作品已譯成七十五種語言，總銷數是三二四七二〇〇〇冊。</p>
<p>根據普希金的作品新編的兩種歌劇也在莫斯科劇塲上演。這就是莫斯科作曲家白魯可夫（Y－uri　Biryukov）所寫的「鄉下太太」（Lady　R－ustic）和烏拉爾作曲家齊尼亞克（Vakov　Che－rnyak）所寫的「死公主的故事」（Tale　of　theDead　Princess）。前者的劇詞是由著名的權威杜萊林（Sergei　Purylin）寫作的。</p>
<p>普希金的作品已成爲許多蘇聯作曲家的源泉。例如格里卡（Gilnka）的「路絲蘭與陸美娜」（Ruslan　and　Ludmila），恰可夫斯基（Cha－ikovsky）的「亞尼徽」（Evegeni　Onegin）和「紙牌王后」（Queen　of　Spades），莫蘇爾格斯基（Mussorgsky）的「戈登諾夫」（BorisGodunov），達　　什斯基（Dargomyzhsky）的「美人魚」（Mermaid）以及珂沙可夫（Rimsky－Korsakov）的「沙皇沙丹的故事」（Tale　ofTsar　Saltan）和「小金雄雞」Golden　Cooke－rel）。</p>
<p>列寗格勒的普希金博物館在停頓了五年以後，現在又開放了。地點是莫衣卡街（Moika）十二號，詩人在這地方度過他最後的數年；在決鬥受傷以後，就死在這地方。普希金的房間保護得好好的，　他在生的時候一樣：　具，　桌，　水瓶，書籍等等，一切都照原樣。二月十日下午兩點四十五分，一部分代表到這地方靜默一分鐘，又讓普希金時代成立的樂隊在這屋子裏演奏。</p>
<p>普希金曾　過兩千張以上的圖畫和鉛筆速寫，這些都附有詳註，收在全集十七卷本裏面。詩人頗愛好繪畫，在他手稿的邊上時常　滿了　寫，有些與詩或故事的主題存關。普希金的賽第一次公開於世是一八三七年，當時詩人已經逝世，Sovrenennik雜誌刋出了普希金一首詩，連帶一幅僧侶禱告的賽。</p>
<p>查夫羅夫斯基（Tsyavlovosky）對於詩人在一八二六年與尼古拉一世的會晤，曾有一篇詳盡的演說。大意說，詩人被遺戍以後，會請求沙皇允許他治病，把他送到彼得堡，莫斯科或外國都行。他的請求許久不曾得到回答。有一天，一位特使來了，呌普希金到莫斯科去見沙皇。普希金與沙皇會面後，毫不顧忌。他不隱瞞他對於一八二五年十二月暴動分子的同情。他直說，臺果那一天他在彼得堡，他也會與「反叛者在一起的」。沙皇親：「人家說庫其爾倍克爾（Kuchelbeker）反叛是發。」普希金却勇敢地回答說：「發瘋並不是遺戍所能醫治得好的。」</p>

<h3>友情</h3>
<p>— 趙</p>
<p>我常常想，生平無可値得　傲者，有，就是我一直不斷享受着友情的溫　！友情滋養我活在這個艱辛的時代裏！友情像一根手杖似的支持我走着一段又一段的長而坎坷的路。多少次，我爲貧，病；爲某種惡勢力；跌倒了，是友情再把我扶起來，再鞕策我一步步向前邁進着！</p>
<p>尤其難能珍貴的是，我所享受的友情都是毫無利害關係的純友情。道些給予我友情的人，他們對我絕沒有任何企圖，只是出于一種由衷的祟高的道義之愛！正因爲如此，我尊重他們甚于尊重我的親戚，家屬。</p>
<p>他們，有和我一樣窮的朋友！有比我更窮的僕人；也有我的學生。他們所給予我的溫緩，有精神的，也有物質的。</p>
<p>精神的溫煖，是他們能够深刻的瞭解我，瞭解我的思想；瞭解我的性格；瞭解我的志趣；瞭解我的心情；因此，他們不强我爲所不欲爲者。他們體恤我；信任我；遠在我的任何親戚家屬之上，他們使我的靈魂永遠不感覺寂寞，孤獨。</p>
<p>物質的溫煖，這是友情表現于外的，然而也聯帶和精神的溫煖有密切關係。他們知道我窮，他們也知道我窮得硬朗，因此他們不送我錢花，却常出我意外的送我一胎需要的東西，這些東西都不是什麼貴重的，但儘管所費無幾，牠除了帮助我解決實際需要以外，還具着更大的紀念意義，以及鼓勵與安慰的作用。文常常半打趣半贊羨地說：「窘不住你的！只要你的這些朋友們都活着，你就永遠不會挨餓，受凍。」是鈞。我的這些朋友們（包括我的先生，學生，和僕人。）都待我太好了！從我十六歲離開家起，我就開始靠朋友的支持生活！第一個在學業上帮助我最力的人，是文！她的帮助是精神重于物質，沒有她，我也許至今還關在「家」裏。所以我對于她有着難以泯忘的感激。此外最使我感動的是幾次患難中友情的帮助，記得在開封我曾被人誣告入獄，當時我的先生，學生，朋友，以及我的僕人，都紛紛給我送用具，食品，使我雖置身監牢，猶能睡行軍牀作好夢；吃麵包裏腹；誠是不幸中之大幸。又在七年前，我重病於四川北踏，老友雲衛不顧自身之貧困，爲我購得價値昂貴之特效退熱藥，使我轉危爲安。我的學生沛　日夜伴同床側，心力俱瘁，至今想來，還感愧交集！不是嗎？我給了他們什麼呢？勝利以後無資復員，我繪了幾幅畫，由竺兄代我售出，解決了我一個返鄉的願望。之後，勝利給我帶來了莫大的惆悵，沒有友情的撐持，我怕會早就倒下去了！</p>
<p>今年春天接到瑩自美國給我寄來的大衣，使我惑到冬季有保障了。前些日子又接到媼如托人從紐約給我帶來的筆，這是友人送我的第四枝筆了，在相繼遺失三枝以後，這一枝的候補，勉勵我再繼續寫下去！上禮拜君兄來看我，告訴我：「既然你堅持潔身自好，不擬走出你的斗室　房，那麼，我願替你把牠油漆一番，使得牠更美觀，你也更安於蹲蹰下去！」我不反對，於是君兄履行了他的約言。我的學生徽，看見我衣着單薄，親手爲我織了一件毛衣，使我加在去冬小曼爲我織一件毛衣之上，嚴寒向我畏縮了，我感受著物質的精神的雙層溫煖。</p>
<p>如今，我坐在新油漆的書房裏；穿着曼·蕙送我的寒衣；執着　如寄來的五十一號筆寫這篇小文。我是又欣慰，又難過！適巧地派人槓來兩擔木炭，於是我烘起火盆，我心然得像要迸烈，我的眼淚一滴滴掉到爐灰裏！我形容不出我這時的情緒，我眞覺得友情偉大！友情像一把火；一　燈，它燃起我生命的力；它照亮我靈魂的眼睛；它使我有勇氣挺身活下去；它使我認淸我應走的路！</p>
<p>我已經非常滿足了，友情給我住得很舒適，友情給我穿得很溫後，顯然我是吃著我自己的心血，而我的僕人願意盡義務地爲我燒飯；我還茍求什麼呢？我實在够幸福，够值得驕傲的了！</p>

<h3>論畫二題　論畫</h3>
<p>— 林風眠</p>
<p>給無極　（趙無極油畫展·時間本月廿六至卅一日·地點大新公司）</p>
<p>我想，人類所追求而表現在藝術上的，是人類的理想與物質的和諧，也就是生命與宇宙的和諧。希臘人的彫像，是在道種和諧中，使我們惑到神與人之間的意味。</p>
<p>一個藝術家的創作，總是用全部生命的力量爭鬥出來的，藝術上艱苦而冗長的路程，無極在走著，我還記得他在離開重慶時，他個人展覽會中的作品的他用自己的眞誠與良善的本質，熱情的衝動，把他從自然事物中得來的感覺，用兒童的天眞，原人的純厚，與淸新的形式去表現他所得到的東西。由重慶回杭州之後，他住在西湖山間多年困苦抗戰的生活，得到比較略爲安靜的休的生活，在安靜中，使他對自己的創作重新加以檢討的機會，因此在創作的道路中，也重新開展了一個更新更艱苦更冗長的路程</p>
<p>我想這不過是他的苦難的開始，展覽會之後，他要到歐洲去了，他要到法蘭西去了，他要把他自己投到巴黎新興藝術的急流與漩渦之中，他得開始在急流中掙扎，漩渦中打滾，他要用他全部的力置，帶回給我們新的寳貴的柬西。</p>
<p>我現在很淸楚了，我們所帶回來的這麼渺小而可憐的東西，對整個中國藝術的傳統是不易有所作爲的，但有一點，這渺小而可憐的東西，也許就給了我們，重新認識中國藝術的力量，因此惑到中國的藝術，唐宋以後，那貧窮的慘象。確定了這慘象繼續的原因，是在我們的感覺中，不特沒有從過去的傳統裏過去所得到的形式裏，重新解放出來，而且也沒有加進什麼東西去。</p>
<p>我們所帶來的，只是一點色彩和寫實主義的外形，願無枉在歐洲，願許多新的藝術家們，因你們急流漩渦中掙扎的精神，給東方藝術慘象上來一個巨雷霹露的震蕩，像希臘天帝的火一樣使她復活。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「大概就是東京的新玩意兒，職業暗殺團吧！」萍子淺笑着。說畢，把　得又嬌又艷，鮮紅的小口，又抿上了。</p>
<p>「不，我是問車尾坐上的那位—小姐。」鶴見含混着語意。</p>
<p>「哦，她？」萍子喉嚨裏起了一串格給笑聲，勉强壓制着：「她是您一位老朋友…春子姐…忘得這般快？」</p>
<p>「噢！」鶴見的記憶力並不算壞，一聽見萍子說出這個春子的名字，立即想到前次探索「七封秘械」時，近衛別府　夜　劍的那一　，那個長短雙劍；對着自己　勇砍殺的女劍手，不就是萍十口裏的春子姐嗎？可是她那時罩着面紗，誰又見過她的本來面目呢？</p>
<p>「她什麼時候上車的？怎麼不給我正式介紹一下？」　見惑覺有點失禮。</p>
<p>「大哥，別搗兒哪」！車子裏伸出一隻素玉般的柔荑，對鶴見站的所在，非常藝術化地這麼一報；這一報之中，也藏着一個　　暗號。服從警報暗號，是情報人員的天職。</p>
<p>「對不起，萍子」！鶴見的搗鬼，又落了下乘；上車之後，只好弄兩句話來掩飾一下；「沒想到車裏還有人，更不知道是你咧」……</p>
<p>「嗯」？萍子一邊發動引擎，把車開上了行車路錢，一面似理不理地這麼「　」了一聲。這聲省當然十分甜脆；因她練過音樂：「……您認爲天下只有您一人乖巧哪，是不是」？</p>
<p>「不，不，萍子」！　見仍奮裝作十分漂亮地，速說帶笑：「我認爲天下只有我一人最拙笨啊！你想，要是不笨，還能不猜到車中有人？」……</p>
<p>「可是我早看到了您大哥的一雙腿咧……嘻」—萍十嬌媚地笑着，大概氣已消了。</p>
<p>「可惜我的眼睛也很拙笨……並且你藏在車裏，呌我無從看到哩」。　見仍在繼續掩飾。</p>
<p>「大哥，光學您也念過，幾何學，拋物綫，直綫，　綫，什麼，什麼，大概您却還記得；難道您還不知道鏡面的反射角度　直關係？我在鏡面裏能見您一部分，，您當然也能在反射裏見到我的一部分咧。萍子咭咭呱　說了一片學理，正是要揭開　見的掩飾，窘他一下，作一個小小報復。</p>
<p>「這卻有些冤枉我了」。　見把在東京的情形，說到這裏，忽地又　開正文，這麼對我訴　：「當時我確實沒想到鏡中反光對角　直的理由。無論如何，我的掩飾又落了下乘了！……可是誰像這些妖怪女人這樣的精細呢」？</p>

<h3>聖誕的憧憬</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>記得童時會看到過一種專畫兒童景物的「香烟畫片」，俗稱香烟脾子，因那時尙不到抽香烟的年齡，故而已記不得是那一種香烟所附送的了。但我猶能回憶起當時看到玩　子，賞金魚，放花炮，掉龍燈等畫景時那種憧憬的心情，就是此時寫起了猶爲之油往不止。</p>
<p>那種畫片是用彩色石印的，色調十分鮮艷（至少在我當時的眼光中是如此），兒意的服裝，畫面的背景，用現在的藝術眼光看也許十分庸俗，但却是充分表示了當時安詳恬靜的一般生活情調。而使我現在想念不止的，也正就是這悠閒快樂的生活情調。</p>
<p>現在三十歲出頭的人，雖已經能糾滄桑，但總形還能回憶起一些兒童時代昇平日子的快樂空氣。尤其是逢到過年過節，在幼稚的意心中更充滿了快樂的情緒。特別是過年，可說是一年中兒童最快樂的時期了。這時學校早放了假，身心似乎完全獲得了解放，平時喫不到的東西，現在可以儘喫了；不過在這樣的時候喫的一念總是不放在心上的，全部的興致是集中在玩。像玩「升官圖」，擲「狀元紅」，滾鐵環以及踢毽子等玩意見，簡直不知有所厭倦。</p>
<p>這類玩意兒也許在現代的兒童間仍舊存在，但我懷疑現在的兒童是否仍懷着當時兒童們一樣的童心。講到玩的花樣，現在當然比過去不知多了多少，就說玩具吧，現在有飛機，坦克車，假鎗炮，眼睛會動的洋娃娃，小汽車，小脚踏車，以及附有軌道的小火車等等，而我那時有的祇限於木製槍棒刀棍，爛泥娃娃，以及現在在神隍隍廟前攤頭上尙能看到的木碗木魚等而已。</p>
<p>但是現在的兒童是否較過去的兒意在心靈上更感幸福，更快樂些呢？我相信兒童的心總是樣的。祗是他們現在生不逢時；已不能享受昇平時代見重的快樂情景了。對於現在的大部份兒童，玩泥娃娃和揑粉人的時代雖已成過去，然而抱大洋娃娃的希望，倒已成了投在他們脆弱心靈上的一層晴影。就是「香烟牌子」也已經不再是兒童的恩物了。</p>
<p>這幾天正是歐美人一年一度最熱鬧的聖誕節，聖誕節雖然是一個宗敎意味的節日，但實際上不妨說是歐美國家的兒童節。西洋兒童盼望過年一樣。但聖誕節對於兒童的意義，則較我們的新年似乎更多給予兒童快樂的成份。試想聖誕老人，聖誕樹，這構成聖誕節的兩項主要節目，豈非悉為兒童而設？</p>
<p>不管一個人對於基督敎的宗敎信仰抱着怎樣的見解，但對於像聖誕節這樣一個節日，我想總不致有人認爲完全無意義吧？事實上聖誕節確也不是單純的宗敎節目，而是基督敎文化與歐美民間生活傳說相融和的產物。例如聖誕老人與聖誕樹，都與基督敎本身並無直接關係的。</p>
<h3>晉陞十訣</h3>
<p>— 維英</p>
<p>一年將　，又是各機　公司廠家年終靠　的時候了。老實說，雞不願意在這時候躺聽到「晋陞」的消息呢？</p>
<p>慣用冷嘲的眼光看人生的人們也許會說：「想升級麼？容易得很，祇要學會了吹牛拍馬，上司前面逢時逢節厚厚地送一份禮就好了」，。這種人是永遠不滿於現實的，但是他們也永遠不肯腳繼實地的來改善現實。他們看不起周團的人們，彷彿自已是最高　的——但是事實上一有機會，他們照樣也會得同流合汚！</p>
<p>最近，有十位美國的人事問題專家，母人提出了一種最有效的得到　陞的「秘訣」。這十項秘訣都是平易可以實踐的，決非不著邊際的空論或是自作聰明的「冷話」，因亟譯出，供有志的職業靑年們參考。</p>
<p>你如果想晋陞，你就應當付出你晋陞的「代價」。——那位專家說，「我在一次哈佛大學校友會上碰到了一位老同學。在二十年前，他是學校裏各位老師同學一致認爲必能大有發展的人物，但他至今還不渦是銀行裏一個小職員。他不願付出晋陞的「代價」，因爲他每天一到五點鐘就把公事匆匆結束，馬上回家；晋陞的「代價」是加倍的辛勞，是辦公時間外的工作，是堅決地完全履行自已的實任上但是他不肯。』</p>
<p>選擇自己擅長的工作，選定後，切勿見異思遷。而最要緊的是不要專挑輕易的工作做！</p>
<p>到同事們的利益，不要　在自己的一部門裹，而不管別人接手後能不能辦得通。</p>
<p>工作之前，先定下一個計劃——然後立定決心，必須實現這計劃中的每一項細目。</p>
<p>如果發生了困難，應當趕快畫面記錄下來——這是避免藏權混淆的最有效的辦法，你的上司一看到了你的報告，他就知道工作方面應當怎樣調整了。</p>
<p>做人要坦白平易，不要故意去討好別人，更不必專門數衍同僚——你該做的事，你必須做；你不該做的事，絕對不能做。私人的事務，你應該儘量帮別人的忙，但「公事」必須「公辦」！</p>
<p>要有推動的力量——推動的力量也就是一般人所謂「魄力」。許多誠實謹愼一絲不茍的人們不能得到晉級，毛病就在於他們沒有推動的力量，不能正確地判斷同僚們的能力而加以適當的配合運用，因之就永遠不能做一部門的主管人員。</p>
<p>切忌避重就輕，推諉責任，如果發生錯誤，要有坦白承認的勇氣；當然，更要有改過的決心。</p>
<p>要挑選一個有「學習機會」的職業——要經常學習，經當進步，千萬不可加入祇採用「自己家里人」的公司或廠家。</p>
<p>如果你已經是某一部門的主管人員了，那末，最重要的一點是要能够讓你手下人放手做事，不可太處處事必躬親，在你固是好意，而大家的「情緒」反而會因之低落的。</p>
<h3>談梁山泊戰術</h3>
<p>— 雪學</p>
<p>傳軍把平綏一路守得鎭壁一般，凡「扒路專家」對於其他各路之手段，一無所施。是因爲傳軍對地方雖取撫綏主義（以應付對方爭取民眾）而於護路則取嚴格主義，沿鎭路之警戒綫內，如有犯者立時格殺。不諭是員衆誤入，是對方有策略的潛進，一　開槍或逮捕，故西北一路始終無隙可乘。而東北（平潘）西南（平漢）兩路之所以時時被毁，即因警戒綫不密，又多顧慮。</p>
<p>混合民衆，出沒無當，是「梁山泊的戰術」，熟讀水滸傳者自能領略。三打扈家莊，買伏內問，智取生辰綱之化裝賣酒人，以及大名府，會頭市等節目，都是以「奇襲」及「散伏」而得利。其攻伐梁山官軍方面，關勝，索超，呼延灼等，只有所謂「堂堂之陣，正正之旗」，所以屢屢中計，不是被俘，就是迫而自投。不但水滸，即三國關羽威震華夏，曹操幾乎遷都以　其鋒，而東吳之呂　「自衣渡江」，僞裝老百姓擾亂後方，使關雲長之威武陣容，完全崩潰了。</p>
<p>正史上說「宋江以三十六人橫行河朔，轉掠十郡，官軍莫敢攖其鋒。」於是，水滸作者就此寫出許多「橫行」「轉掠」的特別戰術。似對付此等戰術，不是沒有辦法。故史　張叔夜討平宋江是「使間者覘所向，江徑趨海濱，刧巨舟十餘，載鹵獲，叔夜募死士得千人，設伏近城，而出輕兵距海，誘之戰，先　壯卒海旁，伺兵合，舉火焚其舟，賊聞之，皆無鬥志，伏兵乘之，擒其副賊，江乃降。」可見叔夜的戰術，正是以毒攻毒，以梁山術制渠山八，使問諜，遺偵探，用敢死隊挺進軍，設埋伏，行計誘敵，潰亂其陣營，消滅其鬥志，絕對不是「堂堂之陣，正正之旗」而是「以其人之道，治其人之身」，所以成功。</p>
<p>傅氏關於「守」的方面，已得區域「堅壁淸野」；其攻的步驟，雖據對新聞記者說事關軍機未便奉告，似報所云「須利用對方弱點」，及「民衆協力」等語，可見「知己知彼」，或如張叔夜的做法。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第五章　飛來橫禍　（二二）</p>
<p>原來這所面臨什剎海的房子，便是林福田秘密藏嬌之所，每天綺紈來時，就住在這裏，這夜福田親到校塲胡同，把綺紈接來，二人在房內閑話，正要預備就寢，不想風波突起，林太太率領娘十軍，前來宵襲。福田這位太太生性奇妬，福田飛黃騰達，有今日地位，完全是由他外兄　申義一手造成，福田爲了此種關係，平日對於這位太太，又敬又怕，他自認識綺紈之後，每次在外住宿，總是託辭奉派出差，不能回家。林太太虛榮心最重，爲了福田功名前途，心裏雖然不願意，却不便阻止，最近一月來，見福田十天有八天不在家，行動鬼祟，不免生疑，經她四處打聽，才知道福田有了外遇，這一氣非同小可這這晚偵得福田和綺紈正在什剎海住宅聚會，率領男女侯人，趕上門來。看門老李，剛一開門，才間一句「找誰」，林太太盛怒之便賞他一耳光，跟來僕　隨喝道：「局長太太來了，你不想道嗎？」這「局長太太」四字林太太最得意的名稱，逢人便自稱局長太太，一般下人也稱她局長太太，老李早已耳熟，一聽是局長太太，急得屁滾尿流，跑進去報告，敲着　門，喊道：「局長！局長太太來了！」福田立時慌了手脚，急呌綺執躱開，綺紈生性倔强，平日最是負氣，在此情况之下，那肯屈伏，冷冷一笑道：「你不是說這是我的家嗎？既是我的家，我便是這家主人，你太太來了，我黨然接待，何必躱開！」福田央求道：「她不是這樣人，你暫時躱開好了。」綺紈把身王扭一扭頭一偏道：「我爲什麼躲她！」這時林太太已站在門外，把門擂得震天價嚮，福田再三央求，綺紈祗兀立在窗前，兩手交叉胸前，低頭不理。林太太在外面，見房門打不開，一時性急，抓一隻小板凳，正對玻璃一拌，一整塊大玻璃窗，嘩啦一聲，打得粉碎！綺紈正立在窗前，一陣碎玻璃，迎頭蓋下，綺紈哎喲一聲，面上，手上，胳臂上，傷了好幾處，鮮血直流。福田大驚，急趕過去，問她怎樣？拿着手絹擦她額上的血。林太太在窗外，見福田竟敢擁抱屋內那個女人，更忍不住，便大喊一聲：「好大膽的奴才！」奮不顧身，兩手攀著窗門破口處，把頭向內一伸，後面兩腿，田僕婦帮同一托，爬了進來。</p>
<h3>懶人自辯</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>我性素懶，近來尤甚，這幾天天氣奇寒，索性不想起床了。拙荊遂嘖有煩言，說：「你難這是諸葛亮，每天高臥被中，等劉備來三顧戒三樓？天也冷了，歲也暮了，還不出去張羅張羅，弄點柴米，你這個懷人呀！」</p>
<p>我是懶人，不諱言懶。我的懶結果於我與家人是禍是福，頗難斷言。以終日臥牀不起，無人送來金鈔，致太太不能團爐打打麻將而論，我的懶當然爲禍於她，若以不必在　風中奔走街頭，擠電軍，看不大好看的陌生人面孔而論，我的懶於我是福。</p>
<p>但無論如何，懶總勝於不懶，假如我一旦不懶起來，黎明即起，奔走街頭，結果又有什麼好處？在在目前這個世界，勤儉起家已經是「不合潮流」的「頑固」念頭，不勞而獲才是「適合時代」的「摩登」辦法。我相信今之富翁，其財均在床上發的，至少坐在家裏的躺椅上得之。據一個常常參觀投機塲所的朋友告訴我，凡「大戶」有所「進出」，總是來一個電話辦理，「搶搶　子」的「散戶」，才遠道而來，躬親交易，獲利之　，却前者十百倍於後者。舉此一例，足概其餘。</p>
<p>這是說懶之於己無損。倘就對人而言，則懶人之造福人羣，更匪淺鮮。我常想世界浩刧之造成，就因爲世界上大政治家的殊欠懶惰。假如希特勒略有三分懶性，併奧吞捷之後懶得再攻波蘭，第二次歐戰必不發生。假如日本軍閥略有三分懶性，懶得愉製珍珠港，事情也就簡單得多。再以近事來說，要是馬歇爾莫洛托夫有我的幾分懶性，說天又冷路又遠，我不想到倫敦去了，則四外長會議就可不開，不開就不至於不歡而散，不不歡而散就可免掉許多驚人的後患。</p>
<p>我虔誠祝禱世界上的偉八巨頭越來越懶，懶於整軍經武，懶於呼籲世界和平。我總希望不久的將來，聯合國開大會時沒有一個代表出席，因爲各代表均懶於起床，懶於去會塲上唇槍舌劍，爭得面紅耳赤，不歡而散，種下日後動武的禍根。……</p>
<p>至於我自己呢，我雖非叱咤風雲的偉人巨頭，但仍當懶惰下去，因爲一不懶惰之後，難免小則去拿點別人的錢放在自己袋裏，大則因努力而漸漸的偉大起來，卒致引起了大家的麻煩。即使偶發呆想，要寫這麼幾句，以後也決定擬睡在床上，口授小犬，由他筆錄付郵了。</p>
<h3>蛇</h3>
<p>— 易里</p>
<p>蛇，這種身體細長，缺少了四肢的動物，行動的時候那麼迅速狡詭，看起來實在令人畏懼。實際上蛇是非常智慧的，其中有些對於飼養者多表親近；聽一位英國友人說，英國的女子很愛蛇，只要不是有毒的種類，他們就歡喜拿在手中撫模，可見中外的觀點之差異了。</p>
<p>蛇爲了要適應環境，四肢便慢慢的退化，有少數種類仍有後肢的痕跡存在。牠的五官和一般脊椎動物大同小異。眼購沒有眼臉，而代以瞬膜，休息時像簾子遮著窗門似的覆在靈活的眼上。產生的淚水都流入鼻腔，所以誰也沒有見過蛇在流淚。蛇耳朶的構造和別的動物不同，主要的差別是沒有肉質的外耳，因此有些人便誤認蛇是沒有耳朵，事實上牠的聽覺十分敏銳。蛇的鼻子最發達；舌細長柔軟，在前端分爲兩支，不斷的伸縮着，都是覓食時候的主要感覺器。</p>
<p>鼠和蛙是蛇類愛食的動物，可是蛇的身體狹小，怎樣來吞食身體比牠粗壯的東西呢？這實在是一件又艱難又有趣的事情。蛇在捕獲了合物以後，便用那兩根鈎齒緊緊的　著，然後慢慢的移動，務使被　者的頭部先被吞進。吃的時候是左右下顎交替的向前推動，逐漸使食物整個進入口腔以至身體中。嚴格說起來，吞食的情形是蛇的身體在動作，食物本身毫無移動。倘吃的是一個相當大的動物，則頭部和頸部往往膨大得很可憐，鱗片也豎起來，血管脹得像要破裂，但終於把食物壓成了像香腸那肅細長的東西。有人常說：「人心不足，蛇吞象。」牠就有道種企圖。</p>
<p>蛇的氣管很長，遠伸在口腔的前端，在吞食的時候，還可以稍伸於下腦之外，故得免因擠壓窒息而死。動物往往有特殊的構造，來補償牠們的缺陷。</p>

<p>據說，魏晉間的文人是以酒來避禍的，於是留下世說新語之類的「風流」來，爲後世人所觀賞；也爲後世人所歎息：歎息這許多有才能的人却只好逃避現實的不幸遭遇。</p>
<p>其實，倘能天天獲得喫酒的機會，即使並不「風流」，只是一點官能的低級刺激，母寗也是可羨的，在我們看來。因爲今天重慶的文人，酒對於他們已經和血一肅珍貴了。</p>
<p>本來，在四川，特別是重慶，從來酒店是一切商業的第一位：即使是僻巷，也有一兩家「冷　碗」舖子的，其數量決不少於紹紹興但今天，文化人却不敢經於問津。</p>
<p>重慶貨物稅局自定了一種單行法，每一　酒廠，不論大小，一律派駐工廠員一名，以便　徵，而其薪水膳食則由該廠負擔。這新負擔當然轉嫁在銷費者身上了，酒安　不貴？——可是這不是財政部的命令，爲重慶所獨有之制。商人是敏惑的，還沒實行，酒價便惡狠狠地一跳。</p>
<p>一個費文者之妻病危了，必需輸血，血是有的，買不起，只好由自己身上輪給。太太病好，自己却血於低下來，必需　一點酒，才有精神做事。而他却買酒也如買血一樣地難，只好一有錢便痛飲，却往往醉得人事不知，自然難於作事，沒有錢時，也便沒有酒喝，更打不起精神來了。</p>
<p>自有歷史以來，文人便是窮的；然而想喫點酒，也和燕窩角翅一樣不易得，恐怕「不數觀」吧？</p>
<p>龍生畫了一幅圖畫，是「醉打山門」，呌我題詞‘我便把元曲裏「赤條寫來云　豪掛」那一關北點綘唇寄生草寫了上去。可是，我本來想把水滸上原句「這幾日只呌酒家吃素，口裏淡出烏來」却終於未寫。但寫上去，這幾句話不但使人親切，也使普天下善男子——一切有情，一齊淚下！</p>

<h3>Government Strengthens Financial Controls, Strict Management of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decided, Executive Yuan Passes Two Measures in Routine Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan held its 35th meeting on the morning of the 23rd, presided over by Premier Zhang. The meeting passed important matters such as the Regulations for Strengthening Financial Controls (full text published on the left corner of page 2), the draft Organizational Regulations of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau, the establishment of a Review Committee for Receiving Enemy, Puppet, and Traitor Cultural Relics, and several appointments and removals.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations were passed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd. It is reported that the content of the management regulations is divided into management methods for cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, as well as methods for military supply of yarn and cloth for export, and principles for production guidance. These regulations were drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the principles of unified purchase, unified sale, commissioned spinning, and commissioned weaving, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Management: 1. All cotton required by designated commissioned spinning mills shall be purchased by the association at the prescribed price, and free purchase is not allowed. Cotton required by non-designated spinning mills shall be purchased by the association on their behalf, or they shall apply to the association for approval and obtain a certificate, and purchase it themselves at the price prescribed by the association; 2. The unified purchase of cotton shall be handled by an institution established or entrusted by the association; 3. Cotton merchants in cotton-producing areas shall sell all the cotton they have collected to the association's unified cotton collection institution at the price prescribed by the association, and shall not sell it privately; 4. Designated commissioned spinning mills shall report the amount of existing cotton in storage to the association and shall not sell it; 5. All cotton machine packing plants in various places shall be controlled by the association; 6. At important transportation hubs, customs clearance and transshipment of cotton shall be verified based on the transportation certificate issued by the association; 7. The association shall have overall control over the purchase of foreign cotton, the receipt of foreign cotton at ports, and the export of yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign cotton. Cotton Yarn Management: 1. The association shall allocate all the domestic and foreign cotton it controls to various spinning mills for commissioned spinning of cotton yarn, except for other permitted uses; 2. Spinning mills with more than 3,000 spindles and deemed qualified by the association shall be designated by the association to spin cotton yarn in accordance with the prescribed methods; 3. Commissioned spinning mills shall set the amount of cotton used for spinning each bale of yarn at 453 pounds, using the association's current qualified cotton as the standard, and the commissioned spinning fee and profit (including unified tax, etc.) shall be based on 459.5 pounds of cotton (20-count raw material) per bale of 20-count yarn as the calculation standard, and shall be paid in legal tender converted at the price prescribed by the association; 4. Commissioned cotton yarn shall still use the original trademarks of each factory, but shall meet the specifications of the standard products set by the association, and the association shall send personnel to periodically sample the yarn, conduct centralized inspection, and reward or punish according to the quality. 6.

<h3>Amendment to the Organizational Laws of the Five Yuan: Executive Yuan to Have Fourteen Ministries and Three Commissions; Legislative Yuan's Organization and Powers Expanded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The amendment to the organizational laws of the Five Yuan was fully passed after discussion at the Legislative Yuan's routine meetings on the 23rd, morning and afternoon. The meeting today was chaired by President Sun, and President Yu of the Control Yuan was also present to explain. The main points of the amendment to the organizational laws of the Five Yuan are that the original four ministries and three commissions of the Executive Yuan remain unchanged, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce retains its original name, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is abolished, the Ministry of Labor is renamed the Ministry of Social Affairs, a Ministry of Food is added, and the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is renamed the Executive Yuan. The number of Legislative Yuan committees is increased from seventeen to nineteen, the chairmen are renamed conveners, and the number of people is also increased from one to three or five. The number of judges of the Judicial Yuan is increased from nine to seventeen, the qualifications are relaxed, and the term of office is changed from the original lifetime tenure to nine years. The Supreme Court, Administrative Court, and other institutions are re-established. The organizational law of the Control Yuan changes the original system of sending supervisors to various places to conduct inspections to allowing the Control Yuan to divide the country into regions and establish Control Yuan supervisory offices as needed. The main amendment to the organizational law of the Examination Yuan is to increase the number of examination committee members from eleven to nineteen and to change the Examination Department to the Examination Ministry. The meeting also passed the organizational law of the Legislative Yuan committees and the amendment to the law on the election and recall of legislators. The next routine meeting will be held on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The draft amendment to the Executive Yuan's organizational law was discussed at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 23rd. After a heated debate on the establishment of ministries, all seventeen articles were amended and passed. It was resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would still be called the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications would be abolished, and the Ministry of Labor would be renamed the Ministry of Social Affairs. The original eight ministries and commissions were changed to seventeen ministries and commissions. However, Secretary-General Lou Tongsun temporarily read an order from the National Government, stating that the Executive Yuan requested that the current National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics be changed to a Ministry of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and be affiliated with the Executive Yuan. This case was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration in the afternoon. Regarding the Executive Yuan's request to add a Ministry of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, some suggested placing it after the Ministry of Food, while others believed that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics should not be changed to a ministry, and that the Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics did not need to be a political appointee. President Sun cited examples from Britain and the United States, explaining that foreign budget offices were departments of the Ministry of Finance, and that we did not need to establish a separate ministry, and that the Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics did not need to advance and retreat with the cabinet. It was resolved to amend the Executive Yuan's organizational law again, changing Article 5 to "The Executive Yuan shall establish a Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and a Government Information Office, and their organizations shall be determined by law." (Full text of the Executive Yuan's organizational law published in the left corner)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Proposals Divided into Government and Committee Types</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The amendment to the Legislative Yuan's organizational law was discussed by the Legislative Yuan on the 23rd, morning and afternoon, and has been passed. The main points are that the original seventeen committees have been increased to nineteen, and the original one chairman for each committee has been changed to three or five conveners. Each committee will also add one to three specialist committee members. The proposal procedures are also divided into two types: government proposals and committee proposals, to show the distinction. President Sun explained the main points of the amendment to the Legislative Yuan's organizational law at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 23rd, stating that the powers and organization of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the constitution will be expanded. In the future, all national governance guidelines and policies must first be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion, so its importance is by no means comparable to the current Legislative Yuan. This amendment to the organizational law adds several committees, which are established according to the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, in order to better coordinate administration and legislation. The reason why important rules of procedure of the Legislative Yuan are included in the Legislative Yuan's organizational law is that the main work of the Legislative Yuan is to hold meetings, and the important rules of procedure should be included in the organizational law. Another key point in the new amendment is the method of making proposals in the future. The new regulations, based on the strengths of both the United Kingdom and the United States, stipulate that both the government and committee members can make proposals. However, in order to prevent an excessive number of proposals from committee members, committee proposals must first be submitted to the plenary session for discussion. In the future, each committee will have three to five conveners, which is related to party cooperation. In the future, there will be no so-called minority or majority parties in our country, and all political parties participating in politics will be government parties. With three to five conveners, if there are important military issues, opinions can be communicated in advance to avoid division.</p>
<h3>Increase in Grand Justices, Term of Nine Years; Examination Yuan's Examination Department Changed to Ministry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The amendment to the Judicial Yuan's organizational law and the amendment to the Examination Yuan's organizational law were passed at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. The biggest changes in the former are in the Grand Justices section and the various levels of courts section. Regarding the Grand Justices, the original organizational law stipulated nine people, but now it is increased to seventeen. The qualifications were not specified in the original organizational law, but now it is stipulated that they should have the following qualifications: A. Have served as a judge of the Supreme Court for more than ten years. B. Have served as a legislator for more than nine years. C. Have served as a professor of major legal subjects at a university for more than ten years. D. Have served as a judge of an international court or have authoritative works on public law or comparative law. E. Have studied law, have rich political experience, and have a renowned reputation. The term of office is set at five years. During the meeting, Chen Ruxuan argued that the Grand Justices should have lifetime tenure in order to be transcendentally independent and not be swayed by political tides. Zhao Pei and Jian Guansan opposed qualification E, believing that those with rich political experience could also serve as Grand Justices, which would easily lead to incompetent people filling the ranks. Dai Xiujun and others opened the door for friendly parties. As a result, the term of office for Grand Justices was still set at nine years, and qualification E was retained. Regarding the original organizational law of the various levels of courts, it only stipulated that the Judicial Yuan would establish civil divisions, criminal divisions, administrative trial divisions, and a civil service disciplinary committee. After the amendment, the current system was restored, and the Supreme Court, Administrative Court, and Civil Service Disciplinary Committee were re-established. The main amendment to the Examination Yuan's organizational law was to increase the number of examination committee members to nineteen and to change the original Examination Department to the Examination Ministry.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate of Taiwan Dollars to Legal Tender Changed to One to Ninety</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The Bank of Taiwan here announced that the exchange rate between Taiwan dollars and legal tender will be increased to one to ninety from the 24th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Reports at the Executive Yuan: US Conducting Aid to China Work, Soviet Currency Reform Results Not Good</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] When the Executive Yuan held its routine meeting on the 23rd, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, stating that US aid to China work was underway. Recently, the US Congress passed a bill to allocate 18 million US dollars for temporary assistance, showing US concern for us, and there may be more assistance in the future. Regarding the Soviet currency reform issue, Wang explained that he had received reports from our overseas envoys, but the effect of this reform was not very good. The new currency could not be fully redeemed, about 30%, and the Soviet people suffered a great loss as a result.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Well-informed sources said that if the US Congress approves the China aid and reconstruction plan early next year, President Truman will directly and urgently invite Wei Demai to take the lead, and he is expected to accept.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The head of the US military advisory group in China, Rear Admiral Murray, has been transferred according to the usual practice. His vacancy will be filled by Rear Admiral Pi, who is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on January 1 to take office.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Convocation Order, Government Set to Promulgate Tomorrow, Election Headquarters Reports Elected Representatives Exceed Legal Number</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] As of the 23rd, the number of National Assembly delegates who have reported to the Election Headquarters has reached 2,000, exceeding two-thirds of the total number of National Assembly delegates. The Election Headquarters will report this result to the National Government today, so that the National Government can issue the National Assembly convocation order on December 25. In addition, a spokesman for the Election Headquarters said on the 23rd that since the Election Headquarters stipulated the procedures for conducting the National Assembly delegate election work, election organs at all levels have actively proceeded according to the procedures. As of December 23, all provinces and cities that have handled the election in accordance with the election and recall law have held general elections as scheduled. All election results have been reported to the Election Headquarters by the competent election offices in various counties and cities or equivalent areas for filing. However, due to inconvenient local transportation, some areas not only have no telecommunications, but also no post offices, so it takes time to report. Moreover, the elections of national and provincial occupational women's groups must count the votes from all provinces or cities to determine the order of election and candidacy. Therefore, as of the 23rd, only more than 2,000 people have reported to the Election Headquarters, and the rest are still being reported one after another. The elections in various provinces and cities that apply supplementary regulations are said to be actively underway, and all will be elected soon.</p>

The Executive Yuan has not yet clarified the content and cannot explain it to the Legislative Yuan.</p>

<h3>Luo Zhuoying Discusses Bandits Exploiting Gaps and Suffering Damage, Shenyang Crisis Gradually Reduced, National Army to Launch Annihilation War Against Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] Luo Zhuoying, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, said that due to the national army's strong forces and strict precautions, the communists avoided attacking "large points" and engaged in "gap exploitation" disturbances. He said that the bandits exploited gaps all the way south from Faku, attempting to attack PanYang, but unexpectedly suffered heavy damage in the battle of "small point" Faku East (southeast of Faku). The bandits were almost completely annihilated, and were subsequently defeated by the national army in Shifosi (north of Shenyang), so the crisis in PanYang has gradually been reduced.

<h3>Editorial: Wartime Bank Deposit Liquidation Measures</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of how to repay wartime deposits, disputes have persisted for a long time. According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, the court, although empowered to make judgments increasing or decreasing payments, this remains only a principle without clear and uniform numerical standards. Considering the case between Chen Jilin and the Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Savings Association, adjudicated by the Shanghai District Court last winter, the amount to be paid was increased by a factor of one thousand. Since then, local court judgments have varied widely, ranging from 800 times, 1200 times, 1500 times, 5000 times, to as much as 10,000 times. This summer, the Chongming District Court ruled that a pre-war loan of 400 yuan should be repaid with 20 shi of rice, which, based on the then-current rice price, amounted to approximately 25,000 times the original loan. Therefore, judicial remedies cannot resolve these disputes. Conversely, requests for provisional execution have sparked protests from creditors. Consequently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed that provisional execution be avoided when defendants provide security or deposit the object of the claim. Furthermore, to avoid increasing disputes, the Ministry of Finance consulted with the Ministry of Justice, requesting all levels of courts to temporarily refrain from making independent judgments until the government promulgates clear regulations for repaying pre-war deposits. Thus, a fundamental resolution of this problem requires further, equitable action through legislation.</p>
<p>Now, the proposed measures, namely the "Regulations on the Liquidation of Wartime Deposits and Loans of the Banking Industry," have been passed by the Legislative Yuan. The full text was published in yesterday's newspaper. The key points are as follows: The term "wartime" is divided into two periods. The first is "pre-formal war," i.e., deposits and loans made before August 13, 1937, to be repaid at a rate of 1,703,462 times. The second is "before the declaration of war against Japan," i.e., deposits and loans from August 14, 1937, to December 9, 1941, with monthly interest calculated and repaid at rates ranging from 1,682,432 times to 700,670 times. Debts exceeding 5 million yuan can be paid in installments. The interest on demand deposits is calculated at half the rate. Loans from national banks to government agencies, and deposits of government agencies and financial institutions in national banks, are to be handled according to the original agreements. The Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, Article 12, do not apply to the liquidation of deposits and loans of the banking industry hereafter. Furthermore, the term "deposits" is clearly defined to include ordinary, reserve, trust, and other types of deposits. Thus, a legal and clear path to resolving this dispute has been found, which is indeed fortunate.</p>
<p>From the perspective of depositors and debtors, perceptions naturally differ. In occupied areas, after the double loss of deposits being halved and then converted at a rate of 200 to 1, it is estimated that a pre-war deposit of 1,000 yuan would be worth only 2.5 yuan. Calculating at 1,703,462 times, formally requiring repayment of 681,464 times the amount, they will naturally cry out that they are suffering a great loss. On the other hand, depositors, due to rising prices and the resulting depreciation of currency, also suffer considerable losses. According to the Shanghai Wholesale Price Index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, with 1936 as 1 and 1937 as 1.1, the second week of this month has already risen to 132,367. Thus, the recent index is over 120,000 times higher than in 1937. Now, monetary gains are only about 1,700 times, so the loss is certainly not small. Even considering the Shanghai Workers' Living Index, with 1936 as 1 and 1937 as 83.98, it has risen to 61,700 in November of this year, an actual increase of over 73,100 times, far exceeding the 1,700 times. As Mr. Liu of the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee said, "Both sides suffered losses during the war," and "it is difficult to devise a better solution other than this," so they must "consider both sides" to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, we want to point out the following three things: First, the issue of how to repay the principal and interest on government bonds. Article 8 of the original regulations states: "The interest on deposits of financial institutions in national banks shall still be governed by the original regulations." Although this is not directly related to government bonds, if the deposits of financial institutions in national banks are not subject to these regulations, then the hoped-for multiple repayment method for general government bondholders is likely impossible. Second, the regulations do not address private debts; these can only be resolved through litigation, in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure. However, given the legislative precedent, the scope of free discretion will likely not be as uneven as before, and indirectly, it can also benefit from the good influence of these regulations. Third, the issue of deposits during and after the war is not covered by these regulations. The name itself is limited to pre-war deposits, and since the declaration of war against Japan on December 9, 1941, the depreciation of the legal currency has become apparent, and various fixed deposits have in fact become very few. We mention this issue in passing now because while fixed deposits are indeed very few, demand deposits have also decreased relatively sharply. Some estimate that the total amount of deposits in various banks and firms now, valued at pre-war currency values, is less than one-tenth of what it used to be. As a result, all the surplus funds in various places are flowing together into the underground money market for speculation, causing unprecedented price hikes and a frenzy of hoarding. If this trend is not addressed by encouraging savings and channeling capital into production, then all other temporary measures will ultimately prove ineffective. But to encourage people to save and turn idle capital into deposits, the key question is how to repay the principal and interest. In other words, how to preserve the value of the currency so that depositors do not suffer unseen depreciation losses, and how to increase interest rates so that they do not lose out, are the practical ways to regulate finance and channel idle capital, and also the effective measures to crack down on hoarding and curb prices.</p>
<p>Now, because the economic situation is too chaotic, everyone has not focused on these fundamental measures and only knows to hastily engage in short-sighted remedies, such as restricting remittances (and there are rumors of restricting the transportation of currency) and restricting lending, etc. Addressing the symptoms in times of emergency, the authorities have their own unavoidable difficulties. But because the restrictions are too strict, all currency will increasingly flee banks and firms and flow into underground circulation and lending, and the result will of course be more idle capital, more speculation, and more difficult regulation. This temporary remedy may not even achieve its original wish. This is far from what we hope for, which is to encourage savings and channel capital into production. We also know that encouraging savings and channeling capital into production is technically very difficult under this inflation. But from the painful experience gained from the pre-war deposit liquidation measures, we certainly do not want to see such phenomena re-enacted in the future in some way, and especially do not want to see surplus funds fleeing banks and firms and becoming truly idle capital.</p>

<h3>Remedial Measures for Academic Status of Graduates of Unregistered Middle Schools During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, December 23, Central News Agency] The academic status of students of private schools that have not been approved for registration should not be recognized. However, in consideration of the special difficulties during the War of Resistance and post-recovery period, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated a remedial measure for the handling of the academic status of graduates of private middle schools that have not been registered in various places. The retroactive recognition of academic status is very generous, and the procedures are simplified. However, the deadline for completion is the end of July next year. The measures are as follows: For private secondary schools in the recovered areas, which were unable to complete registration procedures during the westward movement of the government and did not apply for registration with the puppet organizations, and have now been approved for registration, the academic status of students before registration shall be retroactively reported for approval and recognition, and their graduation certificates shall be retroactively stamped. For private secondary schools in non-occupied areas during the War of Resistance, which have now been approved for registration, their graduates before registration should be given a limited-time examination by the provincial and municipal education departments, and those who pass the examination shall be recognized as having graduated and their graduation certificates shall be stamped. The examination methods and subjects shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for the middle school student graduation examination. Private secondary schools that have not yet been approved for registration should be strictly ordered to register within a limited time, and those that are poorly managed should be investigated and banned. Students who have graduated from these schools and wish to continue their studies will only be allowed to apply for public and accredited private colleges and universities in 1948 with equivalent academic qualifications. For private secondary schools that were originally approved for registration before the war, but were not moved out during the occupation or registered with the puppet organizations, and are now continuing to operate, the qualification of graduates during the War of Resistance from these schools shall be retroactively reported for approval after verification of the operating conditions over the years by the various departments.</p>

<h3>Political Yuan Meeting Approves Amendment to Strengthen Financial Control Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The Executive Yuan's 23rd routine meeting approved the amendment to the Strengthened Financial Control Measures, which will be promulgated and implemented immediately. The measures were formulated by the Executive Yuan due to the frequent financial chaos in major cities, which was obviously caused by speculative manipulation. In addition to establishing financial management bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other cities, the Ministry of Finance drafted these measures. After detailed review by various responsible agencies, they were submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and implementation, and reported to the National Government for record.

<p>B: In areas where financial management bureaus are established, all types of loans from national banks and bureaus, including pledges, loans, overdrafts, discounts, and import/export bills, should be listed. The inward and outward remittances should be listed by location and submitted to the management bureau for review. Those that do not comply with current laws and regulations may be corrected by the management bureau based on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>C: Interbank deposits and interbank funds should be deposited in the Central Bank in areas where the Central Bank is established. In areas where there is no Central Bank, they may be deposited with each other, but in no case should funds be lent to provincial or municipal banks or commercial firms through discounts or any other means.</p>
<p>D: When national banks and bureaus need to remit funds to adjust balances between branches, they should first consult with the Central Bank. If the Central Bank is unable to handle the transaction in a timely manner, they may purchase remittances, but only for transactions that are received and delivered in different locations, with a maximum term of five days, and the payee must be a branch of the original remitting bank.</p>
<p>Article 3: The business of provincial banks should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Bank Ordinance. The following items should be earnestly implemented:</p>

<p>Article 8: When a check issuer violates Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the paying bank or money house shall be responsible for reporting it.</p>
<p>Article 9: If the amount of returned checks from a commercial bank or money house exchange accounts for more than 50% of the total exchange amount for that day for three consecutive times, and it is found that there are obvious reasons for returning the checks to balance the exchange difference, the local financial management authority may set a deadline for adjustment and instruct local banks and money houses to suspend lending to the bank or money house within the deadline.</p>

In serious cases, they shall be referred to the court for handling.</p>
<p>Article 14: When a commercial bank or money house violates the provisions of Articles 4, 5, or 6 of these measures, in addition to any penalties prescribed by law, the responsible person may be ordered to be replaced, or the bank or money house may be fined up to 50% of the amount of business conducted.</p>

<h3>Republican Party May Independently Propose U.S. Aid to Western Europe Plan Vandenberg Hints at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the U.S. Senate and chief spokesman for Republican foreign policy, hinted at a press conference on the 22nd that the Republican Party may propose its own "Marshall Plan" when Congress reconvenes. He claimed to generally support the overall goals of President Truman's proposed plan to aid European economic recovery with $17 billion over four years, but found it difficult to agree on the details. Vandenberg stated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he leads, intends to study this plan in the "most comprehensive" manner. He personally has "no preconceived notions" about the cost, how the plan should be implemented, or whether it should last for four years. Senator Taft, Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, criticized Truman's figures as "excessively high" and first proposed that the plan be adjusted annually.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, discussed President Truman's proposed plan to aid European recovery at a press conference, stating that he will insist on the goal of rescuing Europe on a self-help basis. However, he has no preconceived notions about the methods, quantities, or management procedures, and is willing to accept opinions on the possible impact of the plan on the U.S. economy. He feels that the purpose of the aid is undeniable from the perspective of U.S. self-interest, but the entire procedural issue still needs to be debated.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Republican Senator Taft declared today that if Congress approves President Truman's proposal to allocate $16.8 billion in the first 15 months to aid Europe, European countries may receive more than $8 billion in aid within a year.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Hear Opinions on Aid to Europe Byrnes and Others Invited to Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Washington News, it is reported that when the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee discusses President Truman's long-term aid plan on January 7, many important figures will attend and testify, including former Secretary of State Byrnes, former Lend-Lease Administrator Crowley, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy, and Jones, a member of Roosevelt's cabinet and the most vocal opponent of loans to the United Kingdom. The scope of the issues involved is unprecedented in the history of the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Congress will launch the largest investigation into American public life and opinion as it discusses the Marshall Aid Plan. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to begin hearing opinions on the Marshall Plan on January 7. Those invited to present opinions include former Secretaries of State Byrnes and Stimson, former Lend-Lease Administrator Crowley, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy, and Jones, a former member of Roosevelt's cabinet and an opponent of loans to the United Kingdom. Others who may attend and present opinions include Murray, President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, and representatives of American industry, commerce, and agriculture. Congressional observers expect significant differences in the aid plan finally passed by both houses of Congress.</p>
<h3>Stimson and Patterson Launch Aid to Europe Campaign to Reduce Any Obstruction Attempts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The Committee for the Marshall Plan to Aid European Recovery, an organization of respected U.S. citizens, launched a campaign here today to resist any attempts by Congress to reduce aid amounts or obstruct the passage of the aid plan. The committee is led by former Secretaries of War Stimson and Patterson, and former Assistant Secretary of State Acheson. Acheson stated at a press conference today that reducing the $6.8 billion in aid requested by President Truman for the first 15 months would inevitably affect the entire plan. Reopening the 36-nation Paris Conference to determine the details of mutual assistance would be extremely helpful in allowing Congress to know in advance that the aid goals can be achieved successfully. Acheson opposed discussing the aid to Europe plan on an annual basis and opposed attaching any political conditions. He feels that most of the aid money should be given as grants rather than loans, and that requiring European countries to provide collateral such as gold is a foolish act. Helping Europe increase production on the one hand while requiring it to repay huge amounts of U.S. dollar debts on the other will cause even more difficult balance of payments problems.</p>
<h3>Truman Signs Emergency Aid to Europe Plan</h3>

<h3>Based on Four-Power Consultation Method to Solve Urgent German Problems Clay Expresses Willingness to Make Another Attempt</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Germany, stated that the U.S. authorities should make another attempt to solve Germany's most urgent problems on a four-power basis. If this fails, the U.S. and British authorities will take all possible steps to ensure that the economy of West Germany can continue to move forward. Currency reform, the banking system, and the exchange of goods are all issues that must be considered and resolved immediately.</p>
<p>He does not believe that the failure of the London Conference has created a new situation in Germany, but merely prolonged the situation. Now, to strengthen economic integration, any necessary steps should be taken. Clay also said that he will meet with General Robertson, the British military district commander, soon after the holiday to study the factors hindering Germany's recovery.</p>
<p>Political Merger Depends on Public Opinion</p>
<p>He also said that there is currently no decision on engaging in political mergers with any region. This decision must be made after the final attempt to solve the German problem on a four-power basis fails. Clay also solemnly denied rumors that the U.S. will withdraw from Berlin, and reiterated that the plan to give German institutions in the two districts greater authority will continue to be implemented. German authorities will be given the power to try those who violate economic laws, and certain German institutions, especially customs, will be given police powers. Clay continued that, in principle, we must seek the opinions of Germans before establishing political institutions in the war zone. However, governmental actions elsewhere may force the original British and American authorities to establish these political institutions before they can seek the opinions of Germans. The decisions of the German Economic Committee of the British and American districts have a significant impact on the determination of German intentions. The German people are currently eager to avoid actions such as the political merger of the British and American districts. Clay emphasized that political mergers are not irreversible actions. Any action regarding 65 million people is not irreversible. He will never establish a government in any part of Germany that the German people do not want.</p>
<h3>·German Currency Reform· Inevitable in the British and American Zones</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Preparations for currency reform in the British and American zones of Germany have been completed and are awaiting the orders of the British and American governments to be implemented. Although officials remain silent on this, related parties believe that this is indeed the case. According to reports in the German newspapers, holders of German marks in the British and American zones will exchange ten old marks for three new marks. However, only one of these three new marks will be in cash, and the remaining two marks will be frozen deposits. Wages and other cash income are expected to remain unchanged. The general price level will also remain stable, except for certain special prices. However, the issuance and circulation of new banknotes will be strictly controlled, efforts will be made to unify the exchange rate, and trust in the currency will be restored.</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Announces · · List of Speculators 700 People Include Pauley</h3>

<h3>The New Agency Promoting the Aid to Europe Plan Holds the Power to Distribute and Purchase Materials (Translated by Our Editorial Department)</h3>
<p>To implement the Marshall Plan, the U.S. government may need to buy and sell materials worth billions of dollars to supply Western Europe. Several government executives and business consultants are drafting the formula for U.S. aid to Europe. The U.S. government will inevitably establish a new agency to handle this task, and it must be recognized by law and directly accountable to Congress. American experts in Washington and New York drafting the methods for implementing the Marshall Plan already have a fairly clear concept of how this agency will be organized.</p>
<p>In the United States, this agency should have two tasks: First, it must decide how U.S. money and goods should be distributed; second, it must purchase the materials necessary for the aid plan and ensure that they reach their destination. In the U.S. government, these two tasks are distribution and procurement.</p>
<p>In terms of distribution, the U.S. government has methods. Although export controls will end in March next year, the President will definitely ask Congress to extend them, and even expand them.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of distribution, there are several points:</p>
<p>First, someone must decide on the needs for U.S. goods at home and abroad. Initially, the U.S. hoped to only take the "things that could be saved" and ship them out, but later found that the number of things that could be saved was quite small. Second, after deciding how much to export, it must be further decided how much of it should be shipped to the regions included in the Marshall Plan, and how much should be shipped to other regions, such as Latin America and the Far East.</p>
<p>After these things are done, the specified amount of materials must be allocated to the ten major European countries and West Germany included in the Marshall Plan. At the same time, the priority of which countries should receive aid should be determined based on the degree of urgency.</p>
<p>To obtain these materials, most experts agree that the U.S. government must personally handle the procurement work, or at least control it. Some people hope that a committee organized by experienced merchants will act as the government's purchasing agent, while others advocate that an opportunity that already exists in the government should be responsible for handling it. Some people hope that several government agencies will send representatives to form a joint committee, while others advocate establishing a new agency dedicated to it.</p>
<p>In Europe, a new agency also needs to be established to help promote the Marshall Plan. Most people advocate that a joint committee organized by the Allied nations during the war should be responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>This committee should be composed of representatives from the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan and the United States. Its task is to determine the needs of the participating countries, carefully consider them, balance the supply capacity and needs, and then decide on the distribution method. However, the final decision-making power will still belong to the U.S. distribution agency.</p>
<p>The agency responsible for promoting the Marshall Plan is being drafted by the Committee on Foreign Aid appointed by President Truman (the chairman of the committee is Secretary of Commerce Harriman). A subcommittee led by Senator Fulbright is focusing on the administrative issues of the agency.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges currently facing U.S. government officials is how the U.S. can fully control aid to European countries without giving the impression of controlling the governments of European countries.</p>

<h3>Fundamental Policy of the Japanese Cabinet Will Be Decided Within This Year Socialist Party Forms New Party to Oppose Cabinet</h3>

However, because Ministers Nishio and Miki were still campaigning in the provinces and had not returned to Tokyo, only State Minister Saito reported on matters related to administrative reorganization, and then the meeting adjourned.

However, it intends to decide on the fundamental policy by the end of this year and immediately clarify the direction of the cabinet's policy."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] It is reported that before January 15, 24 members of the Socialist Party will leave the party and form a new party to oppose the Katayama Cabinet. All 32 members of the People's Cooperative Party may join the new party.

<h3>Cracking Down on a Drug Den in the Dasheng Temple; Police Officers Disguise Themselves as Super-Pious People; Finally, the Monks are Arrested; Accomplices Captured Overnight in Guanyin Temple</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Du, the director of the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct, recently received a tip that Fa Bo, a monk in the Dasheng Temple in Caojia'an, Jiangsu Road, was involved in drug trafficking. He ordered Section Chief Yu Ding to investigate. It was learned that more than a dozen monks in the temple usually did not abide by the Qing regulations and engaged in gambling. However, their defenses were quite strict. He then approved the Criminal Police Squad to investigate. Deputy Squad Leader Ding Binghui and Liaison Officer Zhu Zifu, Squad Leader Shen Zhiren investigated separately. Yi Dang Zhao Boqin, under the guise of recommending ancestors, contacted the abbot monk to discuss Buddhist affairs. The Flame Mouth ritual was held on the 22nd. Zhao wore plain clothes and set up a spirit to recommend. By the evening, the Flame Mouth ritual was completed. The monks invited them to take a bamboo forest tour. After a round of mahjong, a female guest falsely claimed to have a stomach ache. Zhao asked if there were any opium pipes in the temple. They replied that although there was no opium, there was white powder. Zhao then instructed the waiter Wang Pinshan to buy three packets of powder from Fa Bo for 100,000 yuan. At this point, Zhao immediately notified the liaison officer outside the door to report to the bureau. Section Chief Yu ordered officers to rush to the scene with more than 20 auxiliary police officers and arrested the monks Fa Bi, Chongshan, Zongbo, Qi Hui, and Liantang, as well as the resident monk Guantong, and confiscated a large number of opium ash and leftover white powder tin foil, etc., and brought them all back to the bureau. Fa Bo confessed that the white powder was purchased from Yang Cuizhen in the Guanyin Temple on Zhuhua Road. Police were immediately dispatched to escort Fa Bo to the temple. It was already midnight. They climbed over the wall and entered the temple, and arrested Yang and the abbot monk Zengfu, and confiscated 15 opium pipes. According to Yang, the drugs were purchased from Lao Qiang Wu Xirong at No. 4, Lane 17, Fahua Road. They then went to that location, climbed over the fence and broke through the window, and found 86 packets of white powder and three rolls of white powder tin foil in a wooden box on the mezzanine. According to the confession, it was delivered by a familiar A Liu, but he did not know his address, etc. Patrols are currently being stationed in various locations. All the suspects in the case are being interrogated. Director Du of the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct praised the criminal police for cracking the drug case in disguise and specially submitted a request to the General Bureau for commendation.</p>

<h3>Using Military Aircraft to Smuggle Banknotes; Involving Candy Merchants; Should They be Punished? No Legal Provision; Prosecutor Feels Quite Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Air Force Supply Headquarters suspected Li Zhaoxin, captain of the 2nd Squadron of the Air Force, of using military aircraft to smuggle banknotes. During the investigation by the Air Force Supply Headquarters, Sheng Fanchu, a candy merchant in this city who was an accomplice, was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation on the 20th of this month because he was an ordinary citizen. Li Zhaoxin took a military plane to Guangzhou on official leave on October 14. Sheng Fanchu entrusted him to carry 199 million yuan in legal tender and a letter to Chen Hongxu in Guangzhou. The letter stated: "5% of the 9.95 million yuan in legal tender has been paid off. The remainder is divided into three points: 小 A small package of 20 million yuan is entrusted by Mr. Jiang of the Bank of China to Mr. Wang Leirun of the Bank of China in Guangzhou to buy pencils and bring them to Shanghai. 64 million yuan is entrusted to my brother to remit to Shen. Today, the remittance rate to Sui is 780,000 yuan, and Shen receives 1 million yuan. Please deliver it to the bank for remittance to Shen immediately. 115 million yuan, of which 5 million yuan is for Chen Hanquan, and the remaining 110 million yuan is for my own goods." When Li flew to Guangzhou, the smuggled legal tender and letters were discovered by the airport guards. Li was suspected of using his position to smuggle legal tender for profit and was escorted back to the Shanghai Air Force Supply Headquarters for investigation. Li and Sheng both denied smuggling 199 million yuan in military court, claiming that they actually smuggled 64 million yuan, and that the 5% was interest, not Li's reward.

<h3>Christmas and New Year Entertainment; Business Hours Not Allowed to Exceed Time; Prices for Dance Halls and Restaurants; Social Bureau to Revise Today</h3>

The highest price for each Western meal should not exceed 120,000 yuan, and the highest price for each Chinese meal should not exceed 1.2 million yuan. Recently, the food and beverage industry and the Western food and coffee industry have reported that the prices of rice, fish, meat, chicken, duck and other raw materials have risen sharply.

They had disagreements due to housing disputes and had accumulated dislikes for each other. Conflicts have occurred several times, but they were stopped by friends' persuasion. On the morning of the 22nd, Wang came down from upstairs and was about to go to the bureau for work. Because he saw the coal stove placed at the entrance of the扶梯, which hindered access, he questioned Cai Shouzhi and had an argument, which turned into a fight. Cai's younger brother also joined the battle. He violently beat Wang Yongxin and called his elder brother, Cai Yanzhi, who works at the Central Bank, and closed the kitchen, surrounded Wang Yongxin and beat him violently. Although Wang tried his best to break out of the encirclement, he was dragged in by the Cai brothers and beaten again, causing Wang to be seriously injured. Later, a neighbor called the police, and they went to the North Sichuan Road Police Bureau to report. He also went to Siming Hospital to examine the injury. As a result, the doctor confirmed that Wang was seriously injured. Wang Yongxin was unwilling to accept that the three Cai brothers jointly humiliated him. What's more, after the first beating ended, he was dragged into the house and surrounded by the three, which was obviously intentional injury. He is now preparing to seek legal relief to protect his human rights.</p>

<h3>Made a Living in Shanghai 38 Years Ago, Now a U.S. Song and Dance King: Earl Carroll Revisits Old Haunts with Female Star</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Earl Carroll, the world's most famous American song and dance king after Ziegfeld, arrived in Shanghai from America via Hong Kong at 6 PM the day before yesterday, accompanied by Beryl Wallace, a leading lady in his song and dance troupe. Carroll and company are taking advantage of their vacation to purchase stage supplies and costumes for the troupe members in China and Japan. They will leave Shanghai this morning by plane for Tokyo. They will also perform in Hollywood this time.</p>
<p>Carroll and Ms. Wallace met with our reporter at the Hua An Hotel yesterday afternoon, recounting his experiences in Shanghai 38 years ago and the success story of his song and dance troupe, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Carroll was born in Pittsburgh, USA. At the age of ten, he worked as a program distributor, a "little boy," in a theater. After five years, he developed a deep impression and interest in musical theater. When he was sixteen, he went to Manila and worked as a "little boy" on a ship. Later, he went to Hong Kong and worked as a clerk in a company that published the "China Directory."</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai with One Dollar and Seven Cents</p>
<p>He came to Shanghai alone in 1909, carrying only a camera. Walking alone on the street, he suddenly saw a photo studio called "Sullivan." He went in and told the people in the shop that he knew how to take pictures and asked for a job. The photo studio took him in, and Carroll slept in a small room downstairs for three days. At that time, he had only one dollar and seven cents in silver coins in his pocket. A friend from the ship suddenly introduced him to a job as a clerk at the British American Tobacco Company. His job was to convert U.S. dollars or British pounds into silver dollars for the company. He also helped the company pay import taxes on tobacco leaves to the customs. At that time, he was earning 100 silver dollars a month. Carroll still remembers that he often crossed the river to the Pudong warehouse, and asked the reporter if the warehouse still exists today. People outside say that I worked in the Shanghai Customs, that is not true, I have never worked in the Customs. Carroll made a special statement to the reporter.</p>
<p>Photo of American Song and Dance King Earl Carroll and his song and dance troupe star, Ms. Wallace (Taken by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Returned to America, Song and Dance Career Started</p>
<p>He stayed in Shanghai for three months and then returned to the United States. Because he was influenced by song and dance performances in the theater as a child, he began to write songs and scripts for newspapers after returning to his country. In 1917, he joined the war as a soldier. After the war, he continued to write songs and scripts and produced song and dance dramas in New York. In 1921, he built his first theater in New York, when he was only twenty-seven years old. After Carroll produced sixty song and dance dramas, he moved to Hollywood and built another theater and restaurant, which is the nationally famous "Earl Carroll Theatre," the only special theater in the United States, where customers can eat while watching the show, just like on stage. All the song and dance are called "Earl Carroll Vanities." This theater is also a large radio station, broadcasting all over the world. The song and dance troupe currently has sixty girls, twenty-two leading actors, and a total of four hundred employees. His song and dance troupe has filmed for Paramount, 20th Century Fox, and RKO.</p>
<p>Every Girl in the Troupe is Beautiful</p>
<p>The girls in the Earl Carroll Song and Dance Troupe are the most famous, beautiful, and pretty in the United States. Carroll told reporters, "When I first started the song and dance troupe, people thought the Ziegfeld Follies girls were beautiful, but I think that while some of them were indeed very beautiful, not all of them were beautiful. Therefore, I created a new style. Anyone who joins my song and dance troupe must be extremely beautiful and pretty. We don't care if she can dance or sing, as long as she is beautiful, we will hire her and then train her. The standards are very high." Speaking of his standards for choosing beauties, Carroll said that both face and figure are very important, but figure is especially important. Because beauty can be disguised or transformed in various ways. "No one is truly perfect, they all have to rely on makeup." But the figure cannot be transformed. The age of the girls in his troupe ranges from eighteen until she is no longer beautiful.</p>
<p>Champagne Bath Caused a Sensation in the United States</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Carroll caused a sensation in the United States for coming up with the idea of song and dance girls bathing in champagne, and was eventually arrested for obstructing morality. When asked about the champagne bath, Carroll said: "The reason why I wrote this scene was because I read a novel about the Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty and came up with the idea of borrowing the story of Empress Dowager Cixi suppressing Concubine Zhen into the well. At that time, I did not expect that it would attract everyone's attention."</p>
<p>Before the war, they came to China to buy rattan to make frames for the skirts of the actresses, and also bought farmers' straw hats, painted them with colors and used them as decorations. This time, Carroll wanted to buy some fabrics, but found that many of the previous types of silk satin were no longer available. However, he still bought some other fabrics yesterday. Carroll also said that he remembered that there was a Astor House Hotel. But when he went to look for it yesterday, he said he couldn't find it. Actress Wallace said that she couldn't say what impression she had of Shanghai, but she repeatedly praised the "Jimmy's" dinner.</p>

<h3>Chen Xianglin, the Murderer in the Jin Deming Case, Confesses that the Motive was Uneven Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Suzhou, 21st] The murder case of Lieutenant Jin Deming, deputy company commander of the New Recruit Company of the Wu County Regiment Management District, and his wife, has been complicated and bizarre, and the truth has not yet been fully revealed.

They robbed 10 million yuan in cash, three taels of gold, and gold jewelry. According to Chen's confession, the above property was obtained by Jin through corruption and bribery of new recruits.

<h3>MOE Councilor Liu Explains Student Union Regulations: Direct Election System to Cooperate with Constitutional Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Nanjing, 23rd] The Central University Department Representative Assembly recently resolved to oppose the MOE's newly revised student union regulations. According to Councilor Liu Yingshi of the MOE, the original student union regulations were promulgated during the wartime in 1943, and some of the original clauses did not meet current needs. In order to cooperate with the implementation of the constitution and strive for democratization and direct elections, Article 7, "Whether a member of the Chinese Kuomintang or the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps," was abolished, and the indirect election system was changed to a direct election system. The original number of directors was uniformly 17, and now it has been increased to 45 according to the proportion of the school's population, so that there is a widespread opportunity. In order to meet the ideal of selecting those with both virtue and ability, it is stipulated that directors must be excellent in conduct and academic performance, and those with leadership ability should be appointed, all in order to cooperate with the constitutional implementation and train students' legal spirit. Most of the other articles are still the original regulations. In the past, the organization of student unions in most schools was not fully implemented in accordance with the regulations, and they were often controlled by elements with other motives. During elections, there were even so-called campaign groups. The school authorities were lenient and did not ban them, which led to disputes in the recent re-election of the student union at Central University. In the future, all schools should implement the regulations.</p>
<h3>Municipal Primary School Teacher Representatives Support Legislative Yuan's Proposal: Request the Bureau of Education to Calculate Salaries Based on the Cost of Living Index</h3>

<h3>Soochow, Hangchow, and Shanghai Universities' Three Graduating Classes from 1943 to 1945 Unanimously Refuse Screening</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Several hundred graduates from Soochow, Hangchow, and Shanghai Universities from the three graduating classes of 1943 to 1945 oppose participating in the Ministry of Education's screening process. They sent representatives Liu Wenhua, Zheng Dingneng, and more than ten others to hold a meeting at the International Hotel the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter. Ling Xianyang, President of Shanghai University, Sun Ruilin, Secretary-General, Ossen, Dean of Soochow Law School, Zhou Zefu, Secretary-General, and Professor Wu Zhifang attended to provide guidance. The following resolutions were made: The three universities will send representatives to petition in Nanjing; The three graduating classes unanimously refuse the screening; Please ask alumni and students of each school to support the effort. Their reasons are threefold: The graduates of these three classes are now scattered in all directions, some are studying abroad, or have taken positions in the government, creating many difficulties. During the enemy and puppet regime period, many private schools in the occupied areas that registered with the puppet regime were not screened by the Ministry of Education and Youth, and have already been recognized. During the period of occupation, the three universities were forced to change their names due to duress, and did not register with the puppet regime, nor did they have any relationship with any enemy or puppet figures, so this screening seems unfair. The responsible persons of each school stated that it is quite difficult to conduct the screening at this time, and they promised to forward the opinions of the graduates to the Ministry of Education and strive for justice.</p>

<h3>Nanyang Welcomes Domestically Produced Cotton Cloth - Sales Prospects Extremely Promising - Bank of China Also Approves Low-Interest Loans to Manufacturers</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a representative from the Singapore China National Products Association, our country's calico, especially 12-pound fine cloth, has recently had remarkably smooth sales in the Nanyang region. Among them, places such as Singapore, Penang Island, and the Dutch East Indies, where overseas Chinese are concentrated, have particularly broad sales markets. Monthly sales of one million to two million [illegible character] are not difficult. The first batch of cotton cloth from the Fangjian Company trial-sold in the Philippine Islands also had good results. According to estimates, if transportation, sales, exchange, and trade conditions are normal, monthly sales could reach over four million yards. It is reported that the Bank of China in various parts of Nanyang has provided financial convenience to the domestic transportation and sales manufacturers for the domestic cotton products being transported and sold to Nanyang. Upon arrival, low-interest loans are approved, adding another boost to the sale of domestic cloth to Nanyang. Furthermore, before the war, Nanyang mostly used Japanese-produced cotton cloth. The weaving factories that produced these Japanese goods have now mostly been merged into our China Fangjian Company. After being taken over and reorganized, efforts have been made to improve them. The products are actually better than the pre-war Japanese goods. Therefore, they are well received in various parts of Nanyang. However, currently, the cloths sold to Nanyang are generally considered too narrow in width. Most shops have doors around 28 inches wide. The cloth width required in various parts of Nanyang is about 36 inches. The Fangjian Company is now actively planning to reorganize wide-width cloth to meet actual sales needs.</p>
<p>Moreover, there have been repeated rumors that a large batch of Japanese-produced cotton cloth has recently been transported and sold to Nanyang, giving a fatal blow to the sale of our country's cotton cloth to Nanyang. According to the representative, the Japanese-produced cotton cloth currently sold in Nanyang is limited to a portion used by the Allied forces and the British government for barter, so the quantity is very small. The only advantageous condition for this barter of Japanese-produced cotton cloth is that the exchange rate is calculated according to the official price of US dollars, with each pound equal to US$4.02. The exchange rate for our country's cotton cloth sold to Nanyang, based on the current exchange rate, translates to approximately US$3.30 per pound. Therefore, in terms of exchange rate conversion, the export of our cotton cloth does suffer somewhat. Fortunately, the quantity of Japanese goods is not large, and the quality is not as good as our country's cotton cloth. If our exchange rate policy can be flexibly applied, even if Japanese goods are sold in large quantities in the future (which is actually impossible in the short term), our country's cotton cloth will still be able to compete with them, the representative said.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Are Both Weak</h3>
<p>Due to the approaching end of the year, the money market was tight, customer help was sluggish in sales, local street sales were also sluggish, there were very few buyers, and there were still many floating households selling. The market trend was chaotic downstream, especially with the 20-count coarse yarn falling harder. Fine yarn had some transactions near the close, and the price was [illegible character]. By the end, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell slightly by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 47 million yuan. Various grades of 20-count and 16-count coarse yarn fell unevenly, from 100,000 to 20,000 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening was caused by the still tight money market, many multi-heads still sold off, sales from all routes did not move, and even the Shanxi help sold 78 pieces of Longtou fine cloth, and at the same time scattered short [illegible character] pressure, and the market trend collapsed. By the time of the noon close, the Shanxi help [illegible character] bought a lot of Four Gentlemen [illegible character], so as a result [illegible character] fell by 9,000 to 12,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths fell by 4,500 to 12,000 yuan. The overall trend throughout the day was that the blue cloth and Shilin cloth had a harder foothold, while the other cloth markets were weak and uninspired.</p>

<h3>Bank of China Announces Overseas Remittance Figures for October - Ministry of Finance to Ban Private Remittance Shops in South China</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Bank of China recently announced the overseas remittance figures collected in October, totaling 34,616,974,458.64 yuan in national currency. The amounts for each region are as follows: New York 22,418,970,184 yuan; London 2,906,086,896.37 yuan; Havana 1,499,257,000 yuan; Sydney 195,448,716 yuan, Calcutta 261,926,843 yuan; Yangon 860,265,000 yuan; Singapore 34,220,000 yuan; Corollin 23,500,000 yuan; Penang 51,179,990 yuan; Saigon 49,160,528.52 yuan; Batavia 5,692,000,000 yuan; Other regions 624,959,300 yuan; The overseas remittance figures for November will also be concluded in a few days, but because the black market is growing daily, it is not as good as October. In order to reduce the scope of overseas remittance smuggling, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will find ways to ban the "private remittance shops" prevalent in South China. The original nature of this type of organization was postal, and it existed in the mid-Qing Dynasty, and it became more prevalent in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. Because overseas Chinese often carried foreign currency in their letters when they brought letters back to China in their early years, it became customary. As of today, it has become an important channel for overseas remittance smuggling. However, because these private remittance shops do not have a fixed form and organization, nor do they have fixed procedures, everything depends entirely on trust between individuals, so there are many drawbacks. Recently, several private remittance shops suddenly went bankrupt, and overseas Chinese in Nanyang suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>People Carrying Gold Notes - Gold Control Has Not Banned - But No Trading Activities Allowed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, there have been widespread rumors in this city about banning people from carrying gold notes in and out of public places, and it has been said that the Financial Management Bureau has stipulated that it is illegal for people to carry gold notes in public places, and that in addition to confiscating the gold notes, they will also be punished. Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that the Ministry of Finance said that the Gold Control Bureau's move was not based on law, and that it was not illegal for people to collect gold notes. Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Management Bureau, said yesterday on this point that, except for trading activities, the Gold Control Bureau has not stipulated that people are not allowed to carry gold notes.</p>
<h3>Money Market Still Tight</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the national bank bureaus had a large amount of sugar settlement, and the money market was tight. The hidden interest rate was around two corners and five six. The four bank bureaus entered 172.2 billion, the central bank entered 81.1 billion, the large exchange issued 38 billion, foreign merchants entered 17.8 billion, the small exchange issued 152 billion, China entered 99.6 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury issued 11.2 billion.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of the National Economic Council Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Paper Production Increase</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Gu Quan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, a meeting was held at the Central Industrial Testing Institute to discuss the technical issues of increasing paper production in our country. Chen Taoxin, head of the Chemical Engineering Group of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Guidance, and paper industry representatives Jin Runxiang, Jin Liu Ji, and Lin Da, among others, attended the meeting. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that our country will produce 35,000 tons of newsprint next year, to be handled by the various district guilds. Because the quality of domestic products such as woolen blankets and copper wire cloth is relatively poor, imports will be restricted on the one hand, and factories will be actively built for domestic production, to be handled by the Paper Equipment Supply Committee. During the meeting, paper industry representatives requested that the wood pulp from foreign exchange goods purchased by the government be distributed to existing paper mills, starting from the fifth quarter. The above points were assigned to Chen Taoxin (convener), Lin Jueda, Chen Pengnian, Qian Ziyin, and others for detailed discussion, and close contact will be maintained with the National Economic Council at all times in order to achieve the goal of increased production as soon as possible. Furthermore, the Tainan Wood Pulp Factory, once negotiations are completed with the Sugar Corporation and a supply of bagasse is secured, will be able to produce 40 tons of wood pulp per day. Because our country currently lacks raw materials for papermaking, if this becomes a reality, it will make a significant contribution to the papermaking industry in our country. As for the issue of the cost of increasing paper production, according to experts, under this plan, production will increase and foreign exchange can be saved, so it is indeed a constructive plan.</p>
<h3>Unredeemed Tea from This Year to Be Auctioned by the Farmers Bank Next Week</h3>
<p>The Farmers Bank accepted new tea as collateral for loans this year. A portion of these loans have matured and remain unpaid. The bank is specifically following the procedures established by the Joint Treasury and is holding a public auction. It is reported that the auction has been approved by the Joint Treasury. All tea exporters are eligible to bid. The auction price, according to the bank, is to avoid affecting the market. As of now, the number of overdue loans is not large, at just over 10,000 boxes, accounting for one-fifth of the total. The value of the overdue loans is estimated at over 10 billion yuan. These boxes of tea are designated for export. To take into account the difficulties faced by tea merchants, the bank will allow redemption before the auction if proof of a foreign transaction is provided.</p>

<h3>Two Babies</h3>
<p>— by Arab Kahlil Gibran, translated by Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>A prince stood on the terrace of his palace, addressing a large crowd gathered for the occasion. He said, "Let me congratulate you and this entire fortunate nation, for a new prince has been born. He will inherit the name of my esteemed family, and you will justly boast of him in the future. He is a new heir of a noble lineage, embodying the glorious future of this nation. Sing and rejoice!" And the voices of the masses, filled with joy and gratitude, resounded in the sky with excited songs, welcoming this new tyrant who would rule the weak with cruel authority, exhaust the strength of Yemen, abuse their souls, and place the yoke of oppression upon their heads. For this destiny, these people were drunkenly singing and celebrating the health of this new Emir (an honorable title for Arab chieftains – translator).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another infant stepped into life and into that nation. While those crowds were glorifying a future tyrant with songs, exalting the strong and making themselves even smaller, and while angels were weeping for the people's weakness and servility, a sick woman was lost in thought. She lived in an old, desolate hut, and lying on her hard bed, next to a newborn infant in a tattered swaddling cloth, was starving to death. She was a poor and pitiful young wife, forgotten by the world; her husband had already fallen into the trap of death set by the prince's oppression, leaving a lonely woman, to whom God had sent a small companion on this night to prevent her from working and supporting her life.</p>
<p>When the crowds dispersed and silence returned, this unfortunate woman placed the infant on her lap, looked at his face, and wept as if to baptize him with her tears. Then, with her voice weakened by hunger, she said to the child, "Why did you leave the world of spirits and come here to share the suffering of my earthly life? Why did you abandon the angels and the vast heavens and come to this miserable human world, filled with trouble, oppression, and cruelty? I have nothing to give you but tears; are you willing to be nourished by tears instead of milk? I have no silken clothes for you to wear; will my trembling, naked arms keep you warm? The small animals in the pasture have safely returned to their stalls after eating grass; the small birds have peacefully slept among the branches after pecking at seeds. But you, my child, have nothing but a loving, yet very poor mother."</p>
<p>Then she placed the infant against her withered chest, wrapping her arms around him, as if to make the two bodies remain as one as before. She slowly raised her fiery eyes to the sky, crying, "God! Have mercy, have mercy on my unfortunate countrymen!"</p>
<p>In that instant, the clouds parted from the moon, and moonlight shone through the small window above the door of the poor house, illuminating the two corpses. Kahm Gibran (1888-1931) was an Arab poet and painter, whom the great sculptor Rodin once likened to a modern Blake. In Europe and South America, he is often hailed as the Dante of the 20th century, while among young Arab poets, he is a beloved master. His works include "The Prophet" (translated by Bing Xin), "The Forerunner" (a few excerpts translated by Shen Zemin, published in Literary Weekly), and "The Madman" (a Chinese translation published by Beixin Bookstore, translator unknown), all collections of prose poems. The translator wrote a short essay introducing Gibran after his death, which is included in his book "Under the Lamp." This year, he acquired a newly published English translation of "Tears and Laughter," containing thirty poems and essays, from which this article is translated. Recorded and stored on December 15, 1947.</p>
<h3>Painting of Dawn Glow</h3>
<p>— Ni Yide</p>
<p>Recently, at the faculty exhibition of the Art Academy, I saw two recent works by Mr. Lü Xiaguang. One depicts the Daxiong Palace of Lingyin Temple. The overall tone is somber and solemn. A few rays of light penetrate the dim masses, illuminating three golden Buddha statues, emitting a few flickering glimmers. The smallness of the monks moving on the ground further highlights the loftiness and grandeur of the Eastern temple architecture. The other depicts the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. In the quiet, still water, the ancient Three Pools stand. The nearby lake water ripples, and the background is a row of misty distant mountains. Faint clouds float in the sky, expressing a sense of serene tranquility of late autumn on the lake.</p>
<p>From these two works, one can see that Mr. Lü is striving to use the realistic techniques of Western painting to express the essence of Chinese style. His style belongs to the school of realism, faithfully depicting objective scenes. He does not seek exaggeration or novelty, but simply and intimately depicts everything he sees around him. In this steady expression, he reveals the honest and simple national character of the vast plains.</p>
<p>The important issue in Chinese Western painting today is not the old versus the new in technique, but how to apply the realistic techniques of Western painting to express the Chinese national spirit and local color. Only in this way can we break away from Western imitation and create art that can represent the Chinese national character. Therefore, Mr. Lü's tendency in painting is worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3>Recent Trends in the World of Literature</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>About Pushkin</p>
<p>This spring, the Soviet Union held commemorative meetings and exhibitions in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities to mark the 110th anniversary of the death of the poet Alexander Pushkin. The Postal and Telecommunications Bureau also issued a special commemorative stamp. To this day, Pushkin remains one of the most widely read writers in the Soviet Union. From 1917 to 1947, his works were translated into 75 languages, with a total circulation of 32,472,000 copies.</p>
<p>Two new operas based on Pushkin's works have also been staged in Moscow theaters. These are "The Country Lass" by Moscow composer Yuri Biryukov and "The Tale of the Dead Princess" by Ural composer Vakov Chernyak. The libretto for the former was written by the famous authority Sergei Purylin.</p>
<p>Pushkin's works have become a source of inspiration for many Soviet composers. For example, Glinka's "Ruslan and Ludmila," Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin" and "Queen of Spades," Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," Dargomyzhsky's "Mermaid," and Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Tale of Tsar Saltan" and "The Golden Cockerel."</p>
<p>The Pushkin Museum in Leningrad has reopened after a five-year hiatus. The location is 12 Moika Street, where the poet spent his last years; he died there after being wounded in a duel. Pushkin's room has been well preserved, just as it was when he was alive: his furniture, desk, inkstand, books, etc., all in their original state. At 2:45 p.m. on February 10, a delegation observed a minute of silence in this place, and a band formed during Pushkin's time played in the house.</p>
<p>Pushkin drew more than two thousand pictures and pencil sketches, all with detailed annotations, which are collected in the seventeen-volume complete works. The poet was fond of painting, and his manuscripts are often filled with sketches, some related to the themes of his poems or stories. Pushkin's drawings were first publicly displayed in 1837, after the poet's death. The Sovrenennik magazine published a poem by Pushkin, along with a sketch of a monk praying.</p>
<p>Tsyavlovosky gave a detailed speech about the poet's meeting with Nicholas I in 1826. He said that after the poet was exiled, he requested the Tsar to allow him to be treated for his illness and to send him to St. Petersburg, Moscow, or abroad. His request was not answered for a long time. One day, an envoy came and summoned Pushkin to Moscow to meet the Tsar. After Pushkin met with the Tsar, he spoke without hesitation. He did not hide his sympathy for the Decemberist rebels of 1825. He said directly that if he had been in St. Petersburg that day, he would have been "with the rebels." The Tsar asked: "People say Kuchelbeker's rebellion was out of madness." Pushkin bravely replied: "Madness cannot be cured by exile."</p>
<h3>Pushkin Commemorative Stamp</h3>
<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>I often think that I have nothing worth boasting about in my life. If there is one thing, it is that I have constantly enjoyed the warmth of friendship! Friendship nourishes me to live in this difficult time! Friendship is like a walking stick that supports me on one long and bumpy road after another. How many times have I fallen because of poverty, illness, or some evil force? It is friendship that has lifted me up again and urged me forward step by step!</p>
<p>What is particularly rare and precious is that the friendship I enjoy is pure friendship with no vested interests. Those who give me friendship have absolutely no ulterior motives towards me. It comes purely from a heartfelt and noble sense of love! Because of this, I respect them more than I respect my relatives and family.</p>
<p>They include friends who are as poor as I am! Servants who are poorer than I am; and also my students. The warmth they give me is both spiritual and material.</p>
<p>Spiritual warmth is that they can deeply understand me, understand my thoughts, understand my character, understand my interests, and understand my feelings. Therefore, they do not force me to do what I do not want to do. They are considerate of me, trust me, far above any of my relatives and family. They make my soul never feel lonely or isolated.</p>
<p>Material warmth is the external manifestation of friendship, but it is also closely related to spiritual warmth. They know that I am poor, and they also know that I am tough in my poverty. Therefore, they do not send me money to spend, but often unexpectedly send me what I need. These things are not expensive, but despite costing very little, they not only help me solve practical needs, but also have greater commemorative significance, as well as the effect of encouragement and comfort. Wen often jokingly and admiringly says: "You can't be embarrassed! As long as your friends are alive, you will never go hungry or freeze." That's right. My friends (including my husband, students, and servants) treat me too well! From the time I left home at the age of sixteen, I have been living on the support of friends! The first person to help me the most in my studies was Wen! Her help was more spiritual than material. Without her, I might still be locked up at "home." So I have an unforgettable gratitude for her. In addition, what moves me most is the help of friendship in several hardships. I remember that in Kaifeng, I was falsely accused and imprisoned. At that time, my husband, students, friends, and my servants all sent me supplies and food, so that even though I was in prison, I could still sleep on a folding bed and have good dreams; eat bread and fill my belly; truly, it was great fortune in misfortune. Also, seven years ago, I was seriously ill in northern Sichuan. My old friend Yun Wei disregarded his own poverty and bought me an expensive and effective antipyretic drug, which turned the tide. My student Pei accompanied me by my bedside day and night, exhausting his mind and body. Even now, when I think about it, I am filled with gratitude and shame! What did I give them? After the victory, I had no funds to return to my hometown. I drew a few paintings, which Brother Zhu sold on my behalf, fulfilling my wish to return home. After that, the victory brought me great sorrow. Without the support of friendship, I'm afraid I would have collapsed long ago!</p>
<p>This spring, I received a coat from Ying sent from the United States, which made me feel that I had a guarantee for the winter. A few days ago, I received a pen that Wengru entrusted someone to bring me from New York. This is the fourth pen my friends have given me. After losing three pens one after another, this replacement encourages me to continue writing! Last week, Brother Jun came to see me and told me: "Since you insist on maintaining your integrity and don't intend to step out of your small room, then I am willing to paint it for you, so that it is more beautiful, and you are more content to squat down!" I did not object, so Brother Jun fulfilled his promise. My student Hui, seeing that I was wearing thin clothes, personally knitted me a sweater, which I added to the one Xiaoman knitted for me last winter. The severe cold shrank away from me, and I felt a double layer of warmth, both material and spiritual.</p>
<p>Now, I am sitting in a newly painted study; wearing the cold-weather clothes sent by Man and Hui; holding the Fifty-One pen sent by Ru and writing this short essay. I am both gratified and sad! Coincidentally, someone sent two loads of charcoal. So I lit the brazier. My heart felt like it was about to burst, and my tears fell drop by drop into the ashes! I cannot describe my mood at this time. I truly feel that friendship is great! Friendship is like a fire; a lamp. It ignites the strength of my life; it illuminates the eyes of my soul; it gives me the courage to stand up and live; it makes me see clearly the path I should take!</p>
<p>I am already very satisfied. Friendship gives me a very comfortable place to live, and friendship gives me warm clothes to wear. Obviously, I am eating my own blood, and my servant is willing to cook for me dutifully. What else do I ask for? I am really happy enough, worthy of pride!</p>
<p>(Late at night, December 16, 1947.)</p>
<h3>Two Topics on Painting - On Painting</h3>
<p>— Lin Fengmian</p>
<p>To Wuji (Zhao Wuji's oil painting exhibition, from the 26th to the 31st of this month, at the Daxin Company)</p>
<p>I think what mankind pursues and expresses in art is the harmony between mankind's ideals and matter, that is, the harmony between life and the universe. The statues of the Greeks make us feel the meaning between God and man in such harmony.</p>
<p>An artist's creation is always fought out with the strength of his whole life. Wuji is walking the arduous and long road of art. I still remember his works in his personal exhibition when he left Chongqing. He used his own sincerity and kindness, and passionate impulses, to express the feelings he obtained from natural things with the innocence of a child, the simplicity of a primitive man, and the freshness of form. After returning to Hangzhou from Chongqing, he lived in the mountains of West Lake for many years of difficult resistance life, and obtained a relatively quiet life of rest. In the quiet, he had the opportunity to re-examine his own creation. Therefore, in the road of creation, he also re-opened a newer, more arduous, and longer road.</p>
<p>I think this is just the beginning of his suffering. After the exhibition, he is going to Europe, he is going to France, he is going to throw himself into the torrent and whirlpool of emerging art in Paris. He has to start struggling in the torrent and rolling in the whirlpool. He has to use all his strength to bring back new and valuable things to us.</p>
<p>I am very clear now that the small and pitiful things we bring back are not easy to do anything for the tradition of Chinese art as a whole, but there is one thing, this small and pitiful thing may give us the power to re-recognize Chinese art, thus feeling the miserable situation of Chinese art after the Tang and Song dynasties. It is determined that the reason for the continuation of this miserable situation is that in our feelings, not only have we not re-liberated ourselves from the forms we have obtained from the past traditions, but we have also not added anything to it.</p>
<p>What we bring is only a little color and the appearance of realism. I hope that Wuwang is in Europe, I hope that many new artists, because of your spirit of struggling in the rapids and whirlpools, will give a thunderous shock to the miserable situation of Eastern art, and revive it like the fire of the Greek god.</p>
<h3>Ode to Santa Claus</h3>
<p>— Hanfu</p>
<p>You come just in time, my powerful north wind, from the shrinking human body drops over the steel skin. For you, the snow and the early days for your feet, silver frost transports the night. The brush densely lays how many people laugh, laughing down the verdant freedom of the small cypress tree, but its half erects the dazzling dream of candlelights.</p>
<p>You are too generous, so many gifts fill the streets and windows, magnificent, all for the sake of massively sacrificing "0"s in banknotes.</p>
<p>You are also too compassionate, although the world is full of stiff shadows and the season is so cold and desolate, you still give the feast additional dishes and flavors, embellishing the brocade hall, and adding glory.</p>
<p>Even giving a jade brooch to the silk lapel under the gold necklace.</p>
<p>Your age is not too old, although there is frost between your eyebrows, your temples like clouds. The rich will dress you up, more quietly year by year. What about the poor? Waiting for you to take them to heaven, they can't wait a lifetime.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Probably it's some new Tokyo thing, a professional assassination squad!" Pingzi smiled shallowly. After speaking, she pursed her pretty and bright red small mouth again.</p>
<p>"No, I'm asking about the lady sitting in the back of the car." He Jian spoke ambiguously.</p>
<p>"Oh, her?" A series of giggles rose from Pingzi's throat, barely suppressing them: "She's an old friend of yours... Sister Chunzi... Forgotten so quickly?"</p>
<p>"Oh!" He Jian's memory wasn't that bad. As soon as he heard Pingzi say the name Chunzi, he immediately thought of the night when Konoe Beppu was exploring the "Seven Secret Weapons," that female swordswoman who bravely slashed at him with long and short swords, wasn't she Sister Chunzi in Pingzi's mouth? But she was wearing a veil at that time, who had ever seen her true face?</p>
<p>"When did she get in the car? Why didn't you formally introduce her to me?" He Jian felt a little rude.</p>
<p>"Big brother, don't make trouble"! A pair of jade-like soft hands stretched out from inside the car, reporting to He Jian's location in a very artistic way; this report also contained a secret code. Obeying alert codes is the duty of intelligence personnel.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Pingzi"! He Jian's trouble-making fell short again; after getting in the car, he had to make a few words to cover it up; "I didn't expect there was anyone else in the car, let alone that it was you"...</p>
<p>"Hmm"? Pingzi started the engine while driving the car onto the road, seemingly ignoring him as she uttered this "Hmm" sound. This sound was of course very sweet and crisp; because she had practiced music: "...Do you think you're the only clever one in the world? Is that it?"</p>
<p>"No, no, Pingzi"! He Jian still pretended to be very handsome, quickly saying with a smile: "I think I'm the only clumsy one in the world! If I wasn't clumsy, how could I not have guessed that there was someone in the car?"...</p>
<p>"But I saw your big brother's legs a long time ago... hee"—Pingzi smiled charmingly, probably her anger had subsided.</p>
<p>"It's a pity that my eyes are also very clumsy... and you were hiding in the car, so I had no way to see you." He Jian continued to cover up.</p>
<p>"Big brother, you've also studied optics, geometry, parabolas, straight lines, lines, what, what, you probably still remember them; don't you know that the angle of reflection of a mirror is directly related? I can see part of you in the mirror, of course you can also see part of me in the reflection." Pingzi talked a lot about academic principles, precisely to expose He Jian's cover-up and embarrass him a little as a small revenge.</p>
<p>"This is a bit of a wrong accusation against me." He Jian, talking about the situation in Tokyo, suddenly switched to the main topic, telling me this: "At that time, I really didn't think about the reason for the direct relationship between the angle of reflection in the mirror. In any case, my cover-up fell short again! ...But who is as meticulous as these goblin women?"</p>

<h3>Yearning for Christmas</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I would see a type of "cigarette cards" that specialized in drawing children's scenes, commonly known as "cigarette pizi." Because I wasn't old enough to smoke cigarettes at the time, I can't remember which brand of cigarettes they came with. But I can still recall the yearning I felt when I saw pictures of playing with tops, admiring goldfish, setting off firecrackers, and carrying dragon lanterns. Even now, as I write this, that feeling still wells up inside me.</p>
<p>Those cards were printed in color lithography, and the colors were very vibrant (at least, they seemed so in my eyes at the time). The children's clothing and the background of the pictures, viewed with today's artistic eye, might seem very vulgar, but they fully expressed the peaceful and tranquil atmosphere of ordinary life at that time. And what I miss so much now is precisely this leisurely and happy way of life.</p>
<p>People in their early thirties now, although they have experienced some of life's hardships, can still recall some of the happy atmosphere of peaceful days in their childhood. Especially when it came to New Year's and other holidays, their young hearts were filled with joy. The New Year, in particular, was arguably the happiest time of the year for children. School was out early, and their bodies and minds seemed to be completely liberated. Things they couldn't usually eat, they could now eat as much as they wanted. However, at such times, the thought of eating was never at the forefront of their minds; all their excitement was focused on playing. Games like playing "Promotion Chart," tossing "Champion Red," rolling iron hoops, and kicking shuttlecocks never seemed to get old.</p>
<p>These kinds of games may still exist among children today, but I doubt whether today's children still have the same childlike innocence as the children of that time. In terms of the variety of games, there are certainly many more now than in the past. Just take toys, for example. Now there are airplanes, tanks, toy guns, dolls with moving eyes, toy cars, toy bicycles, and even toy trains with tracks. Back then, what I had was limited to wooden swords and clubs, mud dolls, and wooden bowls and wooden fish that can still be seen on stalls in front of the City God Temple.</p>
<p>But are children today happier in their hearts than children of the past? I believe that children's hearts are always the same. It's just that they were born at the wrong time; they can no longer enjoy the precious happiness of peaceful times. For most children today, the era of playing with mud dolls and kneading flour figures is long gone, but the hope of hugging a large doll has become a layer of gloom cast upon their fragile hearts. Even "cigarette cards" are no longer a treasure for children.</p>
<p>These days are the annual bustling Christmas season for Europeans and Americans. Although Christmas is a holiday with religious significance, it can actually be said to be Children's Day in European and American countries. Western children look forward to it just like we look forward to the New Year. But the meaning of Christmas for children seems to give them more elements of happiness than our New Year. Just think of Santa Claus and the Christmas tree, the two main programs that make up Christmas; aren't they all designed for children?</p>
<p>Regardless of a person's views on Christian religious beliefs, I don't think anyone would consider a holiday like Christmas to be completely meaningless, would they? In fact, Christmas is not just a simple religious program, but a product of the integration of Christian culture and European and American folk legends. For example, Santa Claus and the Christmas tree have no direct relationship with Christianity itself.</p>
<h3>Ten Secrets to Promotion</h3>
<p>— Weiying</p>
<p>The year is coming to an end, and it's time for year-end evaluations at various institutions, companies, and factories. To be honest, who wouldn't want to hear news of a "promotion" at this time?</p>
<p>People who habitually look at life with cynical eyes might say, "Want a promotion? It's easy. Just learn to brag and flatter, and give your superiors a generous gift on every festival." These people are always dissatisfied with reality, but they are never willing to improve reality in a down-to-earth way. They look down on the people around them, as if they are the most noble—but in fact, given the opportunity, they would still be willing to get their hands dirty!</p>
<p>Recently, ten American personnel problem experts each proposed a kind of most effective "secret" to getting promoted. These ten secrets are all simple and practical and are by no means unfounded empty theories or self-righteous "cold words." I am urgently translating them for the reference of ambitious young professionals.</p>
<p>If you want a promotion, you must pay the "price" of your promotion. — That expert said, "At a Harvard alumni reunion, I ran into an old classmate. Twenty years ago, he was considered by all the teachers and students at the school to be someone who would definitely have great development, but he is still just a small clerk in a bank. He was unwilling to pay the "price" of promotion, because every day he hurriedly finished his official business at five o'clock and went straight home; the "price" of promotion is doubled hard work, work outside of office hours, and resolutely and completely fulfilling one's responsibilities, but he was unwilling."</p>
<p>Choose a job that you are good at, and once you have chosen it, do not be fickle. And the most important thing is not to only choose easy jobs!</p>
<p>Consider the interests of your colleagues; don't just focus on your own department and not care whether others can handle it after you hand it off.</p>
<p>Before starting work, first set a plan—then make up your mind that you must implement every detail of the plan.</p>
<p>If difficulties arise, you should quickly record them in writing—this is the most effective way to avoid shirking responsibility and causing confusion. Once your superiors see your report, they will know how to adjust the work.</p>
<p>Be frank and approachable; don't deliberately try to please others, and even less should you specialize in counting on your colleagues—what you should do, you must do; what you shouldn't do, you must never do. You should try your best to help others with personal matters, but "official business" must be "handled officially"!</p>
<p>Have the power to push forward—the power to push forward is what people generally call "魄力" (魄力: boldness and determination). Many honest, cautious, and meticulous people cannot get promoted; the problem is that they do not have the power to push forward, cannot correctly judge the abilities of their colleagues, and cannot properly coordinate and use them. Therefore, they can never be the head of a department.</p>
<p>Avoid taking the easy way out and shirking responsibility. If a mistake occurs, have the courage to admit it frankly; of course, you must also have the determination to correct it.</p>
<p>Choose a career with "learning opportunities"—always learn, always improve, and never join a company or factory that only employs "family members."</p>
<p>If you are already the head of a department, then the most important thing is to be able to let your subordinates do things freely; do not be too hands-on in everything. Your intentions may be good, but everyone's "emotions" will be lowered as a result.</p>
<h3>On the Tactics of Liangshan Marsh</h3>
<p>— Xuexue</p>
<p>Commander Fu has guarded the Ping Sui line as solidly as a town wall, and all the "road demolition experts" have no way to use their methods on other lines. This is because, although Commander Fu adopts a pacification policy towards the local people (in order to deal with the other side's efforts to win over the masses), he adopts a strict policy towards road protection. Within the warning line along the railway line, anyone who violates it is immediately killed. Regardless of whether it is a civilian who accidentally enters or a strategically planned infiltration by the other side, as soon as a shot is fired or an arrest is made, the Northwest line has always been impenetrable. The reason why the Northeast (Ping Pan) and Southwest (Ping Han) lines are destroyed from time to time is that the warning lines are not dense enough and there are too many concerns.</p>
<p>Mixing with the people and appearing and disappearing unpredictably is the "tactic of Liangshan Marsh." Anyone who has read "Water Margin" will understand it. The three attacks on the Hu Family Village, buying off insiders, the disguised wine sellers who cleverly seized the birthday tribute, and the programs such as Daming Prefecture and the Merchants' Association are all profitable because of "surprise attacks" and "scattered ambushes." In the battles against the Liangshan government army, Guan Sheng, Suo Chao, Huyan Zhuo, and others only had the so-called "堂堂之陣，正正之旗" (堂堂之陣，正正之旗: imposing formations and upright banners), so they were repeatedly tricked, either captured or forced to surrender. Not only in "Water Margin," but also in the "Three Kingdoms," Guan Yu's might shook China, and Cao Cao almost moved the capital to avoid his advance, while Eastern Wu's Lü Meng "crossed the river in plain clothes," disguising himself as ordinary people to disturb the rear, completely collapsing Guan Yun Chang's mighty formation.</p>
<p>The official history says, "Song Jiang led thirty-six people to rampage across Hebei, plundering ten counties, and the government army did not dare to confront him." Therefore, the author of "Water Margin" wrote many special tactics of "rampage" and "plunder." It seems that there is no way to deal with such tactics. Therefore, the historian Zhang Shuye suppressed Song Jiang by "using spies to observe his direction. Jiang went straight to the coast, robbed ten large ships, loaded them with loot, and Shuye recruited a thousand daredevils, set up an ambush near the city, and sent out light troops to resist the sea, luring them to fight. First, strong soldiers were placed beside the sea, waiting for the troops to join together, raising a fire to burn their ships. When the bandits heard this, they all lost their will to fight, and the ambush troops took advantage of this to capture their deputy bandit. Jiang then surrendered." It can be seen that Shuye's tactics were precisely to fight poison with poison, using the Liangshan tactics to defeat them. He used spies, sent out scouts, used daredevil advance troops, set up ambushes, carried out deceitful tactics to lure the enemy, disrupted their camp, and eliminated their fighting spirit. It was definitely not "堂堂之陣，正正之旗" (堂堂之陣，正正之旗: imposing formations and upright banners), but rather "以其人之道，治其人之身" (以其人之道，治其人之身: to treat a person as he treats others), so he succeeded.</p>
<p>Fu has already achieved "坚壁清野" (坚壁清野: to fortify the walls and clear the fields) in the "defense" aspect of the area; as for the steps of the attack, although he told reporters that it was a military secret and inconvenient to disclose, as the newspaper said, "we must take advantage of the other side's weaknesses" and "popular cooperation," it can be seen that he "knows himself and the enemy," or follows Zhang Shuye's approach.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Unexpected Disaster (22)</p>
<p>It turned out that this house facing Shichahai Lake was where Lin Futian secretly kept his mistress. Qi Wan would live here every time she came. That night, Futian personally went to Xiaochang Hutong to pick up Qi Wan. The two of them were chatting in the room, just about to prepare for bed, when an unexpected storm arose. Madam Lin led her "female soldiers" to raid the place at night. Futian's wife was extremely jealous by nature. Futian's meteoric rise to his current position was entirely due to his brother-in-law Shen Yi. Because of this relationship, Futian usually treated his wife with both respect and fear. Since he met Qi Wan, every time he stayed out, he always excused himself by saying that he was on official business and could not go home. Madam Lin was very vain and, for the sake of Futian's career prospects, was unwilling to stop him, though unwilling in her heart. Recently, she noticed that Futian was not home for eight out of ten days and was acting suspiciously, which inevitably aroused her suspicion. After inquiring everywhere, she learned that Futian was having an affair. This made her extremely angry. That night, she discovered that Futian and Qi Wan were meeting at their residence in Shichahai, so she led her male and female servants and rushed to the door. The gatekeeper, Old Li, had just opened the door and asked, "Who are you looking for?" when Madam Lin, in her extreme anger, slapped him in the face. The servant behind her then shouted, "Madam Director is here, don't you know?" The title "Madam Director" was Madam Lin's most cherished title. She called herself Madam Director to everyone, and the servants also called her Madam Director. Old Li had long been familiar with it. When he heard that it was Madam Director, he was so frightened that he ran inside to report. He knocked on the door and shouted, "Director! Madam Director is here!" Futian immediately panicked and hurriedly told Qi Zhi to hide. Qi Wan was stubborn by nature and was usually very resentful. Under these circumstances, she refused to submit and coldly smiled, "Didn't you say that this is my home? Since this is my home, I am the mistress of this house. Your wife is here, so of course I should greet her. Why should I hide?" Futian pleaded, "She's not that kind of person. It's better for you to hide for now." Qi Wan twisted her body, turned her head to the side, and said, "Why should I hide from her?" At this time, Madam Lin was already standing outside the door, banging on the door with a deafening noise. Futian pleaded again and again, but Qi Wan just stood upright in front of the window, her arms crossed in front of her chest, lowering her head and ignoring him. Madam Lin was outside and saw that the door could not be opened. In her impatience, she grabbed a small stool and smashed it against the glass. With a crash, the entire large glass window was shattered! Qi Wan was standing in front of the window, and a shower of broken glass fell on her head. Qi Wan cried out in pain, and her face, hands, and arms were injured in several places, with blood flowing profusely. Futian was shocked and rushed over to ask her how she was. He took out a handkerchief to wipe the blood from her forehead. Madam Lin was outside the window and saw that Futian dared to embrace the woman inside the house, so she couldn't help but shout, "How dare you, you audacious slave!" Disregarding her own safety, she grabbed the broken part of the window with both hands and stretched her head inside. The two legs behind her were helped up by the servants, and she climbed in.</p>
<h3>A Lazy Man's Defense</h3>
<p>— Zeshi</p>
<p>I am naturally lazy, and lately even more so. These past few days, the weather has been unusually cold, so I simply don't want to get out of bed. My wife then started complaining, saying, "Do you think you're Zhuge Liang, lying in bed all day, waiting for Liu Bei to come and visit you three times? It's getting cold, the year is coming to an end, and you're still not going out to take care of things, to get some firewood and rice. You're such a waster!"</p>
<p>I am a lazy man, and I don't deny it. Whether my laziness ultimately brings misfortune or good fortune to me and my family is difficult to say. If we consider that I lie in bed all day and no one sends me gold and money, so my wife can't play mahjong, then my laziness is of course a misfortune for her. But if we consider that I don't have to run around in the cold wind on the streets, squeeze onto trams, and see the faces of strangers I don't like, then my laziness is a blessing for me.</p>
<p>But in any case, laziness is better than not being lazy. If I were to suddenly become unlazy, getting up at dawn and running around on the streets, what good would come of it? In the current world, starting a family through diligence and thrift is already an "outdated" and "stubborn" idea. Getting something for nothing is the "modern" way to be "suitable for the times." I believe that the wealth of today's rich people is all made in bed, or at least obtained while sitting in a reclining chair at home. According to a friend who often visits speculation venues, whenever a "big player" makes a "move," they always do it with a phone call. Only the "retail investors" who are "grabbing crumbs" come from afar and personally trade, but the profits of the former are ten or a hundred times greater than those of the latter. This one example is enough to summarize the rest.</p>
<p>This is to say that laziness is harmless to oneself. If we consider it in relation to others, then the benefits of laziness for the people are even more significant. I often think that the world's disasters are caused by the fact that the world's great politicians are particularly lacking in laziness. If Hitler had been just a little lazy and had been too lazy to attack Poland after annexing Austria, the Second World War would not have happened. If the Japanese militarists had been just a little lazy and had been too lazy to bomb Pearl Harbor, things would have been much simpler. To take a more recent example, if Marshall Molotov had had a fraction of my laziness, saying that it was too cold and the road was too long, and I didn't want to go to London, then the Four Foreign Ministers Conference could have been canceled. If it hadn't been held, it wouldn't have ended in disagreement, and if it hadn't ended in disagreement, we could have avoided many terrible consequences.</p>
<p>I sincerely pray that the world's great and powerful leaders will become more and more lazy, lazy to build up their military forces and lazy to call for world peace. I always hope that in the near future, when the United Nations holds a general assembly, no representatives will attend, because the representatives are all too lazy to get out of bed and too lazy to go to the meeting place to engage in verbal battles, arguing until their faces are red and their ears are burning, ending in disagreement, and sowing the seeds of future military action. …</p>
<p>As for myself, although I am not a great and powerful leader who commands the wind and clouds, I should still continue to be lazy, because once I am no longer lazy, I will inevitably, in a small way, take some money from others and put it in my own pocket, or, in a large way, gradually become great through hard work, eventually causing trouble for everyone. Even if I occasionally have a whim to write a few words like these, I have decided to lie in bed from now on, dictating to my little dog, who will write them down and mail them.</p>
<h3>Snake</h3>
<p>— Yili</p>
<p>Snakes, these slender animals that lack limbs, move so quickly and cunningly that they are truly frightening to look at. In reality, snakes are very intelligent, and some of them are very affectionate towards their keepers. According to a British friend, British women love snakes very much. As long as they are not poisonous, they like to hold them in their hands and stroke them, which shows the difference in perspectives between China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the environment, the limbs of snakes have slowly degenerated, and a few species still have traces of hind limbs. Its five senses are roughly the same as those of ordinary vertebrates. The eyes do not have eyelids, but are replaced by nictitating membranes, which cover the flexible eyes like curtains covering windows when resting. The tears produced all flow into the nasal cavity, so no one has ever seen a snake crying. The structure of a snake's ears is different from that of other animals. The main difference is that it does not have fleshy external ears, so some people mistakenly think that snakes do not have ears. In fact, its hearing is very keen. The nose of a snake is the most developed. The tongue is slender and soft, divided into two branches at the front end, constantly stretching and contracting, and is the main sensory organ when foraging for food.</p>
<p>Mice and frogs are animals that snakes love to eat, but snakes have small bodies. How can they swallow things that are thicker than their bodies? This is really a difficult and interesting thing. After capturing the prey, the snake uses its two hook-like teeth to firmly grasp it, and then slowly moves it, making sure that the head of the prey is swallowed first. When eating, the left and right mandibles alternately move forward, gradually making the food enter the oral cavity and even the body as a whole. Strictly speaking, the swallowing situation is that the snake's body is moving, and the food itself is not moving. If it eats a rather large animal, the head and neck are often swollen and pitiful, the scales stand up, and the blood vessels are so swollen that they look like they are about to burst, but it finally compresses the food into a slender thing like a sausage. People often say, "Man's heart is never satisfied, the snake swallows an elephant." It has this kind of attempt.</p>
<p>The trachea of a snake is very long and extends far to the front end of the oral cavity. When swallowing, it can also extend slightly beyond the lower jaw, so it can avoid suffocation due to compression. Animals often have special structures to compensate for their shortcomings.</p>
<h3>Newly Engraved Illustrated Popular Narrative: Wine and Blood</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Long Sheng</p>
<p>It is said that the literati of the Wei and Jin dynasties used wine to avoid disaster, thus leaving behind "romantic" stories such as "A New Account of Tales of the World," which are admired by later generations, and also lamented by later generations: lamenting the unfortunate fate of so many talented people who had to escape reality.</p>
<p>In fact, if one can have the opportunity to drink wine every day, even if it is not "romantic," but just a low-level stimulation of the senses, it is still enviable in our opinion. Because for the literati of Chongqing today, wine is as precious as blood.</p>
<p>Originally, in Sichuan, especially in Chongqing, hotels have always been the first priority in all businesses: even in remote alleys, there are one or two "cold dish" shops, and their number is definitely not less than in Shaoxing. But today, cultural people dare not even inquire.</p>
<p>The Chongqing Goods Tax Bureau has formulated a special law, requiring each winery, regardless of size, to station one factory inspector in the factory in order to collect taxes, and their salary and food expenses are to be borne by the factory. This new burden is of course passed on to the consumers. How can wine not be expensive? — But this is not an order from the Ministry of Finance, it is a system unique to Chongqing. Merchants are sensitive, and before it was implemented, the price of wine jumped up fiercely.</p>
<p>The wife of a writer was critically ill and needed a blood transfusion. Blood was available, but he couldn't afford it, so he had to take turns giving blood from his own body. His wife recovered, but his own blood level dropped, and he needed to drink a little wine to have the energy to work. But he found buying wine as difficult as buying blood. He could only drink heavily when he had money, but he often got so drunk that he lost consciousness, making it difficult to work. When he had no money, he had no wine to drink, and he couldn't get his spirits up.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of history, literati have been poor; however, wanting to drink a little wine is as difficult as getting bird's nest and shark fin soup. I'm afraid this is "not something to be counted on"!</p>
<p>Long Sheng drew a picture of "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate" and asked me to write an inscription. I wrote the Guan Hanqing's [關漢卿; Yuan dynasty playwright] "Stripped Bare, Naked and Daring" from a Yuan dynasty song from the Northern Tune "A Parasite" on it. However, I originally wanted to write the original sentence from "Water Margin," "These days, I have only asked the wine shop to eat vegetarian food, and my mouth is bland." But in the end, I didn't write it. But if I had written it, these few words would not only make people feel close, but also make all the good men in the world—all sentient beings—cry together!</p>

<h3>Explanation from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Regarding the Electricity Saving Charging Method</h3>
<p>Recently, this column has received letters from readers asking for clarification on the penalty methods for saving electricity, and asking for investigation and disclosure. We have requested an explanation from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, and we have received a very detailed reply. We have excerpted it below as a response.</p>
<p>For ordinary lighting and heating electricity users, the standard electricity consumption is 40 kilowatt-hours per month (electricity meters under the same household name are calculated together), limited to the highest electricity consumption in the three months of March, April, and May of this year. The electricity rate within the standard kilowatt-hours is charged according to the prescribed electricity price; the portion above the standard but within the limit is charged at six times the prescribed electricity price; the portion exceeding the limit is charged at four times the prescribed electricity price for the first time, six times the prescribed electricity price for the sixth time, and for the third time and more, in addition to the six times charge, power outages may be imposed depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>(Example) The highest electricity consumption of a certain household in the three months of March, April, and May of this year is 100 kilowatt-hours, then its electricity consumption limit is 100 kilowatt-hours, and the electricity consumption standard is 40 kilowatt-hours (for those whose electricity consumption is less than 40 kilowatt-hours in the three months of March, April, and May, 40 kilowatt-hours will be uniformly used as the electricity consumption standard and limit). Suppose the electricity consumption of the household in November of this year is 120 kilowatt-hours, and the prescribed electricity price is 5,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour, then the electricity bill below the standard is 40 kilowatt-hours multiplied by 5,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan, the electricity bill above the standard but within the limit is 60 kilowatt-hours multiplied by twice 5,000 yuan, totaling 600,000 yuan, and the electricity bill exceeding the limit is 20 kilowatt-hours multiplied by four times 5,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan (plus an additional 10% surcharge). If the electricity consumption in the next month still exceeds the limit, then the electricity price for the portion exceeding the limit will be charged at six times the prescribed rate.</p>
<p>For ordinary commercial lighting and heating electricity users, the standard is 70% of the limit (for example, if the electricity consumption limit of a commercial user is 300 kilowatt-hours, then the standard is 210 kilowatt-hours), and the charging method is the same as for ordinary lighting and heating, except that 3, 5, and 10 are substituted for 2, 4, and 6 times.</p>
<p>For special commercial users, the charging method is the same as for ordinary commercial users, except that the standard is 80% of the limit.</p>
