<h3>助我政府警衞領水　中美海軍協定簽字　無償轉讓艦船多已移交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕中美海軍協定，八日下午四時在外部二樓會裟室舉行簽字禮，我方由王世杰外長代表（海軍代總司令桂永淸因公滯靑未返），美方由司徒雷登大使代表，首先各簽字於兩國執有本，繼交換簽署，歷時僅五分鐘，王氏及司使各以約本交付對方，握手亙賀後禮成，我海軍總司令部參謀長周憲章，外部政次劉師舜，禮賓司長凌其翰，條約司長胡慶育，美洲司長　霖及美大使館公使柯拉克，美軍顧問團海軍上校奧斯華等均列　觀禮。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕外交部公布，外交部部長王世杰博士，代表中華民國政府，與美國駐華大使司徒雷登博士，代表美利堅合衆國政府，於八日下午四時在外交部簽訂中華民國政府與美利堅合衆國政府關於依照美利堅合衆國第七十九屆國會第五一二號決案，轉讓海軍船艦及裝備之協定。</p>
<p>此協定係履行一九四六年七月十六日美國第七十九屆國會所通過，經美總統核准之第五一二號法案，將溢出美國政府海軍需要之若干海軍艦艇及浮塢，無償　讓于中華民國政府，此協定所包括之船艦之一重要部分，業已依租借規定交予中國海軍，此項船艦，現在字面上予以收回，並依此協定之條件轉讓於中國。</p>
<p>此項船艦之轉讓中國，乃爲協助中國政府　衛其沿海及內地領水，保障並改善其領水之航運安全，其戰鬥艦之大小，無一超過護航驅逐艦者。</p>
<p>關於中華民國海軍機構之組織與維持供給技術上之情報與意見，協定中亦有規定，中華民國卅六年十二月八日。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕在京簽訂之中·美海軍協定，係履行一九四六年七月十六日經美國會通過之海軍剩餘艦隻移讓中國之法案，該案由美海長福萊斯特建議，經杜魯門總統批准，助我建立擁有卅萬噸之海軍。移讓之軍艦爲護航驅逐艦級之剩餘船艦二百七十1艘，其中包括驅逐巡邏艦二艘，掃雷艦廿四艘，潛艇驅逐艦廿八艘，登陸艇一九三艘，修理艦二艘，油船三艘，調査艇一艘，摩托砲艇六艘，浮筒六儸，輕型渡船六艘，另附有活動船塢二個及其他器材甚多。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕根據八日在京簽訂之中·美海軍協定，美方無償　讓我國艦艇二七一艘中，最早來華者即爲去年七月十九由林遵中校率領返國抵滬之護航驅逐艦太康，太平，掃雷艦永勝·永順，永定，永寗，防潛艦永泰，永興等租借艦艇八艘及隨後在靑移贈之運輸供應艦峨嵋號，迨無償轉　法案經美國會通過及杜魯門總統批准，並由海軍部公布後，一部在遠東服役之美海軍登陸艦隊，即開始移交我國，由在靑島之我第七艦隊及海軍訓練國會同辦理接收工作，戳至本年九月接收艦艇，計戰車登陸艇中海，中權，中鼎，中興，中建，中業，中輿，中基，中程，中練等十艘，排水量約四千噸，中型登陸艦美珍，美樂，美頌，美蓋，美朋，美盛等六艘，排水量均九一二噸，步兵登陸艇聯珍，聯璧，聯光，聯華，聯勝，聯利等六艘，排水量均三八〇噸，坦克登陸艇合衆，合羣，合堅，合永，合城等五艘，排水量均二七九噸，總計連最大之運輸修理艇峨嵋號（排水量一萬五千噸）共廿八艘，總排水量六萬四千噸，除一部已編隊服役外，一部集中靑島，作訓練海軍幹部之用，其餘贈艇仍陸續來華，八日之協定乃爲此項移接工作作一總括之條約規定，俾此項工作可於一確定之基礎中迅速完成。</p>
<h3>擴大軍事顧問　初步計劃進行中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京八日電〕本社自可靠方面獲悉：美國國會或杜魯門總統指示與中國政府軍以全面軍事援助，美國軍事顧問團即將擴大，其初步計劃已在南京及華府兩方面進行中。負責任官員雖拒不發表意見，但據最可靠估計，美議員紛紛要求以直接援助與國軍，一旦通過，則陸海空軍顧問人員，總數將增至五千六百人，其分配如下：陸軍至少三千六百人，目前三百人。空軍一千六百人，目前亦祇三百人。海軍三百人，目前僅一百十六人。華盛頓方面對於此項擴充雖尙無表示，但因國會議員及注意中國局勢者之一再要求，美政府自不得不加以考慮。其擴充計劃，當然集中於陸軍顧問團長魯克斯，原因有二，第一，中國目前之軍事問題　地上戰爭，第二，美國海空軍顧問團員，按照原定計劃，如能完全執行，已足供擴張。陸軍顧問團現正第一步試行參加在台灣直接訓練中國軍隊，據專家估計，顧問職權至少須由國防部而下，推廣至於團，方能收效，如此非校現有人數增加五倍至十倍不可。海軍顧問團現僅有核准員額三分之一，團長摩萊少將對於增加人數一事，不願置評，但聞擴充至規定員額，可使現在中國海軍之每一艘軍艦上皆有顧問，各海軍學校及司令部內亦有相當之顧問人員。空軍顧問團由湯姆斯准將主持，執行前行政院長宋子文與杜魯門總統在對日勝利後通過之計劃，由美國以顧問供給中國空軍，下至各分隊，以期切實訓練人才。此項計劃由當時駐華美空軍司令斯特拉特梅耶奉命起草，但僅執行其一部份，指派人數不及規定額五分之一。據消息靈通方面預測，美國現正積極進行維持五十四隊空軍計劃，以致航空專家深感不足，中國如欲獲得充份美空軍人員以完成其原來計劃，不免稍有困難。此外，尙有一問題與擴充顧問團有關，則爲南京等處之房屋供應，亦正在考慮中。中國政府對於供給現有顧問宿所一事，頗感困難，致有許多高級軍官不願牽派來華，以免與家族分離日久。</p>
<h3>中美間成立　於葉借款說　蔡業商會無所聞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳中美間成立菸葉借款，數達三千萬美元，由本市某外國公司經理，記者以此事詢諸於葉商會，謂未有所聞。菸商會於兩旬前，因風聞即將成功之美國貸款，將以六七種物資支付，菸葉爲其中之一，該會因即呈文財政部，請求勿准於葉進口，理由爲：實物借款應限於與國家建設有利者，菸葉完全爲消耗品，我國本身能生產，觀於抗戰期內，國產於葉能自給，即爲明證，此時如允許美菸大量入口，影饗所及，將使國內之於農爲之破產。過去菸商會曾向輸管會力爭，要求减少洋菸之輸入限額，結果限額自第一季之八百萬美元，减少至五百萬美元，减省之三百萬美元，全部用以購買紙張，以供國內需要。此時如允准借款之一部以於葉支付，實爲一種變相之傾銷，於國計民生均有損害。前日該會接奉財部批示，大意謂：美貸內容尙未確定，所傳一切不足深信，呈文所提各節，不無理由，已送呈政院，轉送全國經濟委員會再備參考。</p>
<h3>太平洋島上戰具　價値逾十億美元　運華因蘇正在誘毀中</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕美陸軍部官員稱：太平洋島嶼上正在毀龐之職具，足可供配備中國軍隊之許多師團之用，但將此項戰具運往中國之問題，似仍不易解決。據陸軍部估計，現在硫磺島及冲繩島上，已有價値十億元以上之職員，關島及塞班島上，在已銹之坦克車，雷達設備及飛機，但陸軍部官員稱：雖然國會方面要求美國援軍華，而保存此項戰具之費用，將超過其原價，但較運往中國之費用少得多矣。</p>
<h3>開放黃金買賣案　財部四原則不變　銀摟業請願轉政院核定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕銀樓業要求開放黃金買賣，俾維生計事，數月迄未解決，銀樓業代表仍不斷請願，據財部負責人八日稱：銀樓　請願事已轉請政院核定，惟財部之基本態度不變，此基本態度爲：　黃金條塊絕對不能買賣。　央行絕不能供應銀樓業黃金，防流入黑市。　黃金可以公開買賣，惟價格當在四十美元之市價左右，　飾金價格可由各地社會局規定，銀樓業之合法利潤，當亦予顧及。凡超出此種限度之黃金買賣，財部方面殊難允許</p>
<h3>為適合實際需要　萬元以上大鈔政府應速發行　某經濟學家談目前金融情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕「政府應從速發行萬元以上大鈔，以適合實際需要，目前市面稍大數額之交易即已深感籌碼不够之苦，如政府不及時解決，則年關日近，各業需要現鈔益多，其時或將發生高貼水之不良現象，則政府再謀補救，將有為時過晚之感」。此爲某經濟學家對記者分析目前金融情形後所作之結論。渠謂．全國商業聯合會與全國銀行聯合會，因視市面籌碼不够，曾屢向財政當局建議，立刻發行大鈔，最近全國銀行聯合會理監事會在滬開會時，亦曾當塲決議，請求政府即發萬元以上大鈔，但當局因恐刺激物價，不獨遲遲未行，且對類此傳說，亦予否認；此實爲多餘之舉，蓋發行大額鈔票並非物價高漲之原因，反之乃因物價高漲後由於實際需要，不得不發行大鈔，亦可謂爲物價高漲之結果。渠繼對目前之票面幣値與物價作一比較稱：今日市塲流通之法幣票面値最高者爲一萬元，但以目前物價較戰前上漲五萬倍而言，則今日一萬元僅合戰前二角，戰前法幣之發行，即規定有一元，五元，十元，五十元與一百元五種，以與物價比較。則戰前之1元等於今日之五萬元，一百元則相當於五百萬遠。由此觀之，如謂今政府爲避免刺激物價而不發行大額法幣爲合理，則戰前之一元以至一百元之「大鈔」，何並未引起市塲之混亂及物價之波動。由事實證明，刺激物價之原因，絕不在發行大鈔與否，此僅爲投機取巧者之圖利藉口而已。最後渠尙建議政府發行大鈔事絕不應猶疑，爲適應交易之需要，不獨發行五萬元票，且應同時發行五十萬元一百萬元以至五百萬元者，但如何維持幣値减少發行數額，則爲政府之另一責任矣。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京八日電〕財政部主管要員今日聲稱：政府將在本年底以前發行一千元與二千元兩種關金劵，初步分配工作現已開始。</p>
<h3>政府草擬重要方案解決當前財經問題明　年上半年總預算審查中</h3>
<p>〔本　　京八日電〕政府爲達到爭取外援，自力更生之目的，徑政院一度硏討後，已決定草擬對當前財政，經濟，政治，軍事各部門之解決方案。該項方案分爲兩部份：　建設性的，適用時期較長，　對當前問題之治標辦法，爲短期者。關於後者，已決定由張嘉璈，兪鴻鈞，王　五，翁文　四氏起草。</p>
<p>〔又電〕三十七年度上半年國家總預算，其關於政院各部門者，業經六日政院臨時會中通過，其餘司法，立法，考試，監察四院及其所屬機構之預算，國府主計處自八日起開始審査，約周餘可畢。茲據可靠方面消息：三十六年度之支出，與原預算之比例約爲四與一，或更有過之。收入方面，則亦較原預算增加一倍餘，惟因此而益感收支之不平衡。</p>
<h3>徐堪主計長　談平衡收支</h3>
<p>〔又電〕徐堪主計長八日晚接見記者，就平衡收支及穩定物價數事談稱，平衡收支之條件不外增加收入及節省支出兩大原則，在增加收入部份，如整頓稅收亦即關新稅源外，同時應增加生產，使國民富力增加，再其次即爲墓債。關於支出部份，則僅節流一端而已。徐氏並表示，若干稅則條例及辦法均應予修改，以合於現實情况，使老百姓所負担之捐稅，得以涓滴歸公。最後，徐氏論及物價問題，認爲有數個因素必須做到，如：甲，官兵，公敎人員待遇之改善，乙，安頓都市，內，農村安定，從事生產丁，交通恢復。如此，則社會安定，物價不至上漲。</p>
<h3>俞鴻鈞召見各金管局長</h3>
<p>〔又電〕財政部長兪鴻鈞八日晨在財部召見滬，津，穗，漢四金融管理局局長，對即將展開之金管局業務商談甚久，並有所指示。</p>
<p>〔又電〕金融管理局之管轄範　已確定·滬·津·穗三局均以其市區爲範圍，漢局則包括武昌。</p>
<p>〔又電〕花紗布管委會議將來成立後，花紗布均將統購統銷。據關係方面估計，以半年全國生產達一千二百萬担，除農民自用者約五百萬担外，有七百萬担可由政府收購。照目前市價，七百萬担需款達十七萬億之外，政府是否能全部收購，尙屬問題。</p>
<h3>中印簽協定　棉紗換棉花</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕據此間農業部報吿，中國政府最近已與印度政府簽訂協定，以中國十分之一之棉紗及其紡織品，交換印度之棉花。據稱交換之比率約爲棉紗四百磅換優等棉花一千另五十磅，或超等棉花一千零</p>
<p>農業部又稱，印度棉花三萬補，每桶四百磅，已起運赴華。巴基斯坦與中國之同類協定尙在磋商中。</p>

<h3>預南平漢路兩側激戰　劉匪被截為兩段　光山西進國軍繼續追擊</h3>
<p>〔本報九江八日電〕豫南平漢路東西兩側今日戰况仍烈，劉匪西竄部隊已近萬人，劉匪本人可能仍在羅（田）宣（化）店公路附近指揮作載。現偸越鐵路西　者雖已發現有一，二及第十等三個縱隊番號，然匪部可能仍留一部份盤踞大別山。劉匪之獨立縱隊，多係土共烏合之衆，即可能留在大別山。某軍事高級官員今日對本報記者談豫鄂皖邊區過去一週來之戰况，該官員認爲劉匪西竄乃在九江指揮部圍剿計劃預料所及，故九江指揮部自上月廿七a實施指揮權以後，除以大兵由南向北壓迫劉匪作戰外，並于平漢路東西兩側佈成天羅地網，西竄之匪處處挨打，到地碰壁，今日在鐵路兩側之作戰，即係該計劃之一部。總觀今日戰報，該方面戰事已趨白熱化。白部長現坐鎭武漢，有時並親赴前綫指揮或視察陣地。（　　南京八日電〕豫南國軍業將劉匪越　路希　企圖擊破，六日夜劉匪主力第一，七，十二各　隊匪為國軍壓迫，自羅山，光山，經扶單腳地區西　，經信陽及柳林國軍夾擊後，已被截爲兩段，一小股越過鐵路者約三十衆，已於七日為　軍包圍於柳林四南西雙河，譚家河射近，激戰至八日晨，匪斃傷殘慎重，殘部紛向西南大廟畈逃竄，國軍正追擊中，至其主力仍在柳林區，爲國軍圍殲。自　山南龍升鎭向西南追剿之國軍，已進抵　山冲；自光山西進國軍，已直搗　皮河，該區匪勢巳屆窮途末路，現正零星四散，一小股企圖南　廣水以東之　橋，</p>

<h3>經濟管制的技術問題</h3>
<p>凡醫生為人治病，如只知道頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，而忘記了整個病態的檢查與療治，其人決不足以稱為良醫。並非局部的與治標的醫治，一定完全無效；相反地，有時亦頗見臨時良好的反應，無如生理是整個的，　絡是貫通的，局部的特殊手術，如果輕重失宜，往往會得牽動全身，致加深了原有的病症。</p>
<p>目前經濟上種種不安的狀態，大家知道，其原因很多，拿病症來譬喻，好比一個數病俱發症。加以八年的抗戰，和兩年來的內亂，已經瘡痍遍地，元氣大傷。除掉愼重檢查，對症發藥以外，還得加意調查，光行恢復其體力。在過度虛弱之後，如果濫施强烈與猛攻之劑，致過分消弱抵抗力，這當然不是適宜的辦法。</p>
<p>因此經濟上的補救措施，無論如何改進，如何加强，我們認為有幾個原則，不可不時時顧到。其一是全國性，至少是全市性。即在同一個經濟單位之內，一切管制，分配等辦法，總期平等普遍利害相共，做到均平的地步。不要厚此薄彼，更不要顧此失彼，致增加民間的不平，而自毀其努力成果。具體地說：現在一切區域性的或階級性的局部措施，在理論上，終覺不很圓滿。</p>
<p>其二是流通性。不管是貨物，是金融，其作用全在於自由流通，除非國際間別有政策，所謂自由賀易，還不易為多數國家所採用外，其在一國之內，而此疆彼界，故設障碍，或任各地方擅施禁令，妨碍交通，這種畸形　　，並非中央所許可，更非鹽論所同情。試　米　流通，中央豈非三令五申，不許各省擅予禁陰嗎？關東的流通勝，台　的台幣，又豈非以妨碍統一之故，迭遭各方面的非難嗎？以此例彼，則最近國行的控制匯款和停止貸款等辦法，似只可認為臨時性的措施，斷不宜持續過久。其中利害得失情形，最近市高會致院部一電，　發甚詳。一書蔽之，則枝枝節節的堵　辦法，與血脈貫通，貨暢其流之原則，適相反對，當然不是經久的辦法了。</p>
<p>其三是一貫性。此中又含有兩種意議，一為前後辦法的一貫，與各機關執行時手續的一貫，若今日提倡，明日取銷，或更嚴令查禁，如過去的黃金政策，出口補貼政策，公用事業貼補政策，紡織事業管制政策，限價議價的忽張忽弛等政策。其所以急據變更的理由，在當時，縱說得十分冠冕，但在一般的觀感上，總不無張皇失措之象，在商民尤不無時退失據之憾。我們以為立法之祿，自不妨博訪周諮，持以愼重，而一經制定科條，明令實施，便不宜朝令暮改，多所紛更，更不且狐埋狐　，前後矛盾。此乃政府　信之所緊，不單是只求便高便民而已。</p>
<p>每一種法令，其職權上往往要牽連至兩個或兩個以上的機關，因此在執行上，就不免要互相會商，連延時日。其聊　得不甚圓滿時，更不免各自為政，發生重複諉卸等流弊，這是現在習見的通病。其實關係機構，雖或涉及兩個以上，而其中自有主管，有協助，辦限本極分明，只須各守職權，各　已分，便不易讓成紛爭和推諉的現象。例如最近公佈的金融管理局組織規　，其中第一，第四等條，明白規定：其主管機關是上海，天津，廣州，漢口等處的金融管理局，其協助機關，為當地政府及單　機關，如其事項，涉及其他機關　掌者，並得會同辦理。照此條文而　，劃分得十分清楚，決不會發生上項現象。可知現在有許多紛紛擾擾之事，實不能　咎於法令的本身，更非執法的不嚴，而母寗謂為由於關係方面認識的不足。</p>
<p>總而言之，法令是死的，而如何執行，却是活的。所貴因時制宜，斟酌輕重，可使弊去太甚，人民稱便；一面達到政府預期的目的，而一面仍不失扶助工商之原意，這才是善於守法，善於奉行。拿取締囤積這件事來說罷，倘使依照非常時期取締日用品囤積居奇條例，拘文牽義，普遍地並嚴格地推行起來，一切指定的日用品，其轉移存放之間必須一一報告，登記，檢查，定價，代售，或收買，則在大都市如上海等埠，如非有意窒息，使牠完全不動，在事實上，幾於不可能。因為商民方面，一舉一動，動　遭牽制，固將感受到非常的不便，即各同業公會和主管機關，亦安得有如許人手，來應付這件事？然而投機過於熱烈，囤風過於猖獗，倘非殺一　百，把情真罪當的不法囤商，切實地嚴辦一下，實亦不足以抑平物價，而收安定民生之效。所以立法的改進是一事，而如何善於運用這法律，又是一件事。</p>
<p>又如管制紗花布這件事。由紡管會到紡調會，又由紡調會再加強到管委會，在人事上，組織上，不斷地改進，這固足以見當局的重視和決心；我們當然也盼望牠能積極推進，日起有功，以達到增加生產，和安定民生的目的。不過紡織事業的過　。　然要分三大部份：即　充分的原料如何獲得？　代紡代織的手積如何求其合現分　？　不銷與外銷，國營和民營，又如何斟酌　善，各如其分，各得其所？這三大部份，如能系統地來聯貫起來，整齊步伐，一致推進，這固然是管理，而枝節地，只辦一部份，或在一部份內，又零　地只辦一片段，亦不能不算是管理。然而　其效果，就不免有　難之別了。</p>
<p>經濟管制，本是一件極　咋，極繁重的事。除了人事，組織，輕費等等以外，其環境是否配合得上來？其他條件，是否完全具備？這都不是　　理想所能解決。所以推行之初，便抱悲觀；或意存觀望，坐觀成敗，或陽奉陰違，不肯合作，這當然是不合理的。而期望過舊，責備過嚴，亦不是持平的論調。我們意見：凡是事實上管得到，情勢上制得信的事情，不妨通盤籌劃，實行管制，以期效率的增加；其或顧與心遠，故障太多，則酌　放寬，自由營運，亦不失為分道並進，殊途同歸的一法。其在禁止或取締部份，更應顧到增加生產，和維持在業這個大前提。任何手段，任何名義，其緒果只是妨碍生產，或製失業的，那總不是政府立法的初意，更不是一般人民所期許。我們曾經聽到過下面一個笑話。</p>
<p>有一個駝背的人，其家人送往一個庸醫處求治。那庸醫毫不　躇，竟將兩塊很厚的木板，把那駝子緊緊夾在當中，不多一會，那駝子就被夾死了。其家人向庸醫責詢，庸醫答稱：我只管醫駝背，只要被不駝，就算醫好了。至於死活，另是一事，我不能負責。</p>
<p>這固然是一個笑話，未心真有此事。但經濟上患着駝背的人，現在儘多着。所望醫療經濟病的人，總須顧到死活問題，先把他的生命維持住，然後再談駝背問題，方是病家共通的心理。</p>

<h3>外長會議臨成敗關頭　美英法密商對策　決不承認親功德代表團　杜勒斯完成任務返倫敦</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕據悉，英美法三國外長曾於七日舉行會議，並無莫洛托夫之參加。雖非正式會議，但倫敦外長會議開始以來三外長而非四外長之舉行會議，尚屬第一次。官方人士對於馬歇爾貝文皮杜爾三人所談內容，未能透露。然外界已有揣測，三人係討論外長會議如果失敗所可能採取之步驟者。據本社外交記者稱，三外長會談之目的，在準備應付預料將由莫洛和約意見之建議，並非討論在今後一週之外長會內如何採用〔決戰方式〕之戰略。可靠方面謂，德境美軍總司令克萊將軍及其政治顧問　飛之自柏林再來倫敦，係與德國社會統一黨在柏林召開之〔德人民大會〕有關，並非準備結束倫敦會議。英美法三國之將拒絕德國社會統一黨在柏林名單，殆可斷言，蓋三國認爲此一名單乃蘇軍佔領區德國政黨會議所擬，不能視爲德國之代表團。惟外長會議是否得於現階段接見被視爲代表德國之代表團，固尚有商榷之餘地。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕鑒於外界盛傳本屬外長會議之業已失敗，貝文外相特於今日自外交部發表聲明，聞言並無任何發展足以支持本屆外長會議業已失敗之說。外長會議定於八日下午照常在關凱斯特堂開會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕馬歇爾共和黨顧問社杜勒斯赴法三日，與該國當局晤商後，已返　倫敦，據稱此行結果極爲滿意。杜氏赴法主要目的，厥在探詢外長會議萬一破裂，法政府能否贊助與德境英美佔領區合倂辦法。法外長皮杜爾已在此間表示會議破裂如不可避免，法國佔領區願意參加合倂。</p>
<h3>倫敦會議一旦破裂　美準備發行新幣　在德國與南韓境內流通</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕今日據官方可靠消息：四外長會議如告破裂，美財部擬發行一種新幣，俾在德國及朝鮮方面使用。此種新幣現已印就，並已有三車於嚴密保護下自華盛頓運至白洛克森，以備運往德國。</p>
<p>當局對此嚴守秘密已數星期之久，以觀倫敦外長會議之成敗。據佔領區主管官員稱，德國馬克及朝鮮貨幣均將依據美政府重新規定匯兌率，以防止通貨膨脹。德國方面，蘇聯曾將美國於一九四四年戰時所供給之印刷機大印軍用票，充斥總西部佔領區，以致黑市幣值反跌至官價下甚巨，瓣幣發行後，此種軍用票即可宣告廢止。截至一九四五年紗，軍用票照票面價值以美金收兌者約在三億五千萬元之　。新幣付印曾徵得英國同意，惟何時發行，是否在英法佔領區同時流通，及其與現行馬克之兌換率，尚待宣布。現行馬克實際上幾一錢不值。至於朝鮮方面，新幣目下祇能在南部流通，現行鮮幣與美元比價由美軍政府定爲五十對一。鮮幣在戰前發行額共約七十億，現在南部流通者已膨脹至二百億，黑市匯率爲鮮幣三百至四百兌美金一元，戰前則爲五十對一。</p>

<h3>小羅斯福主張美蘇應互諒解</h3>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科八日電〕英商務部長威爾逐，七日續與蘇國外貿易部長米柯揚舉行九十分鐘之會談，英蘇貿易談判，係於上週五開始。消息靈通方面謂此次談判，已獲滿意之開端。</p>
<h3>哈佛港選舉戴高樂獲勝</h3>
<p>〔梧衆社巴黎八日電〕哈費港市民投票時，戴高樂在與共黨爭衡之奮爭中，又獲一次勝利。自戴氏之法國人民大同盟於十月市敎　舉中大獲全勝以後，此次尚爲第一次選舉，哈佛居民對蔓延三　之勞工戰爭已表示反對，選民投戴氏一黨票者佔百分之四十一，投共黨票者百分之四十。按十月選舉中，共黨得百分之四十三，戴高樂僅得百分之廿七。</p>
<h3>與保大晤談後　趙督返巴黎</h3>

<h3>法局勢尚雖樂觀　工潮癥結在於工資難獲協議　總工會與政府意見尚遠</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕解決廣讀三週餘罷工之希望，昨已轉趨淡薄。中央促工委員會發表聲明，指正府之反建議，並不足以號召罷工工友加強其地位繼續堅持以待勝利之獲得，罷工委員會復曰：〔本會對於政府就工人所提要求中之主要部份所採之態度不能同意。罷工之發生，固即係因政府拒絕此等要求而起〕。全國總工會與政府意見距離最遠之點，即爲工人要求之隨時調整工資，以與生活費用相符之制度。總工會秘書勒勃隆表示，生活費用，若再漲一成，政府建議之最低度工資即嫌不足。勞工部長馬以爾則已昨夜表示政府決不接受任何方式之臨時調整制度。罷工委員會之主要要求，乃爲：　工業工人及公務員，每人每月普遍增加工資一千一百二十五至一千五百法郎。　切實保證依照生活費用及適當的最低限度，對工資作週期性的比例調整。巴黎地底火車職工會，昨決議於八日是晨起罷工兩日，以響應公務員之象徵性罷工，惟約佔職工總數十分之一或二所組之獨立工會，則已反對罷工。另據人民報稱，巴黎里昂快車昨在里昂附近出軌，係被人取云　軌鏢絲所致，幸未傷人。</p>
<h3>交通工人取消罷工</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎八日電〕法國總工會附屬巴黎地下交通工人總會因大多數工人不應號召，參加四十八小時之示威罷工，八日宣佈取沙罷工。八日晨於罷工應開始之時，巴黎公共汽車仍　常行駛，地下交通工會於上午十一時後不久宣佈取消罷工。公務員亦預定於八日罷工，然對工會罷工之指令不甚理睬。</p>
<h3>印荷和談開始</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬達維亞八日電〕在聯合國斡旋委員會主持下，荷蘭及印尼共和國八日上午在馬達維亞港美軍艦〔倫維爾〕號上開始舉行會議。荷代表團共計十五人，印尼廿九人，雙方在甲板會議桌上座次相對，聯合國委員會人員及　利艦長之坐席位於兩代表團之間、荷方首席代表爲阿　卡迪爾，印尼總理夏利福亭親自率領代表團，開幕儀式歷時一小時正，九日將正式討論印尼問題。</p>
<h3>緊急對外援助法案　美衆院可望通過　明年六月以前美將繼續撥款</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕衆院可望於今明日以多數票通過對法義奧及中國冬賑五億九千萬元案。一俟該案最後表決，杜魯門總統即將向參衆兩院聯席會議發表咨文，宣布馬歇爾計劃，俾於明年三月後對西歐十六國實施一種四年計劃，助其經濟復興，資助經費約在一百六十億至一百八十億元之間，惟每年經費須依法由國會作一年一度之表決，據國務卿馬歇爾估計，在明年六月以前第一步經費須十五億元，俾與冬賑計劃啣接。</p>
<h3>義共黨遊行示威內閣改組談判在進行中</h3>
<p>〔中央社羅馬七日合衆電〕此間共黨今日曾指揮其黨人約五萬人，在羅馬遊行，以炫耀其軍事力量。自艾達廣塲出發，通過羅馬市中心，抵達維尼夏廣塲，在該處舉行一短時之儀式，以紀念死於戰爭中之同志。工會執委會又提出威脅稱，如政府不能滿足其要求，則將於九日半夜起發動總罷工。工會要求對各失業工人發給聖誕特別節賞，並要求政府調查本月五日左冀份子舉行示威時，其黨徒死一人傷三十人之事件。示威者與警衝突，警察十九名受傷。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬七日電〕加斯員利總理今日繼續與共和黨與溫和社會黨領袖會商，企圖拉攏該兩左翼小黨入閣，以擴大政府基礎。一部份政治觀察家深信今明兩日可望獲至協議。</p>
<h3>聖地英駐軍　下週一開始撤退</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷八日電〕英駐馬勒斯坦高級專員克銀漢八日發表正式聲明，宣布英委治政府擬於十二月十五日起開始自巴勒斯坦之撤退。自彼日起，英軍艦將開始自若干重要城市包括台拉維夫，加發等撤退之程序，英委治政府擬使當地行政，交由當地之猶太或阿剌伯當局負責，俾知彼等能否維持和平。巴勒斯坦政府發言人復加以補充稱，各猶太中心之有大批猶人集居者，英軍亦將幾乎即時開始撤退，阿拉伯區之加　城，斬時將留少數英軍繼續駐在，猶太區之臺拉維夫城則在　護節前，將撤畢全部英軍。惟另據正式宣布，目前撤離巴勒斯坦之英軍。乃依例復員返英之部隊。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕爭執甚久之國家管理煤礦法案，於衆議院明日休會前夕，今晚以五十三票之差，爲參院全體大會通過。今晚九時至十時最後計算表決票中，顯示有一百三十二票造成，七十九票反對。此項法案此次投票，曾有一度曾被認爲係足以危害社會黨領導下之片山聯合內閣之生命者，然　安然度過。</p>
<p>法義政局動盪的前景（本報編譯室譯）</p>
<p>法義的共產黨，目前正致力於打擊美國協助西歐復興計劃的策略。他們將通過共產國際情報局這個組織，接受蘇聯的指揮。</p>
<p>歐洲九國共產黨的代表最近曾在波蘭開會，從它所發表的聲明看，共產黨的政策已經發生了一種　變，那就是我蘇聯希望歐洲各國的共產黨員，成爲蘇聯更密切的軍事盟友。</p>
<p>據華沙來電稱，新共產國際正公開指導歐洲九國共產黨的工作。法義兩國是馬歇爾援歐計劃成敗所獎的地方，道兩國的共產黨也參加了共產國際情報局。其他參加的七國是蘇聯和她東歐的幾個衛星國家，就是南斯拉夫，波蘭，挺克，羅馬尼亞，匈牙利和保加利亞。</p>
<p>這個新組織和　的共產國際，在形式和性質上頗有不同。舊共產國際係於一九一九年成立，其目換乃在推動世界革命。在蘇聯對德宣戰　後，舊共產國際於一九四三年宣告解散。當時史達林曾經說過：舊共產國地的解散，使世界各地共產黨均受蘇聯指揮的謊言，不攻自破。</p>
<p>新共產國際自稱是〔民主的，愛國的。〕創辦這個組織的人絕不提起世界革命。目前，它的行動範圍以歐洲爲限。理論上謂，九國的共產黨都是處於平等地位的；然而事實上，蘇聯控制著其他國家。出席波蘭會議的兩個蘇聯代表，都是統治蘇聯的政治局的委員。</p>
<p>新共產國際的當前目標，就是打擊馬歇爾計劃，這也就是蘇聯政策的一個目標。但在九國的共產黨中，祇有兩國的共產黨在打擊馬歇爾計劃方面任務最爲重大，那就是法義的共產黨。</p>
<p>各國共產黨和蘇聯新策略的次一步驟，就是進入法義兩國。在這兩國中，共產黨都沒有參加政府，但是大政黨，控制著勞工組織。</p>
<p>在法國，共產黨的煽動，可以使政府改革經濟和協力實施馬歇爾計劃的努力，受到嚴重打擊。他們希望現政府倒臺，至於重大內閣，希望倒並不怎樣迫切。</p>
<p>共產黨員最近在凡爾登曾設法阻止法國陸軍卡車載運食糖前往德國。這批食糖是由美國售予法國，準備分發給德境法國佔領區的德國平民的，但是共產黨的報紙主張這批食糖應該分給法國人，不應該分給德國人。</p>
<p>這類行動今後可能會有增無已，而成爲法國共產黨的重大任務。</p>
<p>此在義大利，共產黨刻正考慮採取強硬行動，因爲他們未能眞選舉而掌握義國的實權。</p>
<p>若干義大利人可能丟棄工產黨，因爲後者已公開和蘇聯以及南斯拉夫聯盟，而南國正是和義國爭奪　港的一個國家。但也有一部份義大利人，鑒於左右兩派攤牌之無可避免，可能放棄溫和的政黨而各趨極端。</p>
<p>但是下列各點是值得注意的，蘇聯新策略的成敗，實鑒於此：　由於新共產國際的成立，法義兩國之內的反共情緒勢必大增；　罷工和示威行動，大致將益趨激烈，尤其是義大利，由於她武裝力量之薄弱，最容易發生激變；　工人對於共產黨領導的反應如何，應該特別注意。共產黨勞工領袖之所以得勢，是以維護工人利益爲標榜的。假如法義工人懷疑共產黨在遵循莫斯科的命令而有損工人本身的利益時，共產黨阻撓馬歇爾計劃的嘗試，可能崩潰。（譯自〔世界報告〕週刊）</p>

<h3>桂中樞發明　五綫中文速記</h3>
<p>方法簡便　易於學習</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕名律師桂中樞，前曾創編「桂氏字彙」一種，發明方位檢字法，方位目錄法等，為繼王雲五氏四角號碼字彙以後之又一進步作品對我國文字之科學的處理，買獻極大。最近渠鑒於「華文速記法」在我國尚未被積極提倡利用，其原因實由於中文速記術未臻完善所致，經悉心研究，又發明「五中文速記法」一種，聞渠已呈請内政部註册，將來擬逐漸推廣，預料在華文速記術上必可獲得劃期的成功。</p>
<p>該速寫法在初練習時需應用五速記薄，綫分紫，監，紅，青，黑五色，以國音之聲母與顏色近者在綫上作一記號，如「知」「痴」等昔在紫綫上書記，「欺」「基」等昔在青綫上貴記，速寫時祇須認明聲母之綫或空格，無須寫聲母符號。此外又將國音中之韻母分為單韻母十四個，結合韻母十八個各有特別符號規定，如遇韻母或聲母拼成之字，即在聲母之綫上或空格内以符號按次速寫，速寫完畢，即在原五綫譜上譯寫漢字。一俟練習純熟或能自然運用聲母韻母之符號後，即可無须再用五綫譜，故方法巽常簡便易習。（附　為桂氏速記時留影，本報攝）</p>

<h3>從九江歸來</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>福州小駐·結束了五千年里行程</p>
<p>〔本報五日訊〕南昌到九江，有南潯鐵路，現在已觀歸浙　路管轄，是浙贛路的南潯綫了。我們於十二月三日去九江，搭火車前往，意想中沿綫兩旁的土地，應該比贛東好些，無如一出南昌，又是荒凉滿目。車在行進中倒很平穩，經過了一些車站，行三小時許而廬山在望，在　陽江畔，還有一片凋零的蘆花。不知不覺中，已到達九江了。</p>
<p>豐鮎的年頭收成八九成</p>
<p>九江，記者曾在勝利這一年的九月裏來過，那時冷寞異常，今天舊地重遊，却感到很爲鬧熱，街道上人羣熙　　攘在來往着，不久以前，國防部的九江指揮部設在這裏，這使九江變得重要，也使九江顯得活躍。</p>
<p>聽九江的老百姓說：今年收成有八九成，總算是個豐收的年頭。這裏人口有十四萬，中學有女師等七所。據說戰前還要熟鬧得多，人口也要多一些，現在因爲廣濟，黃梅等縣有戰事，很多商貨遝不出去。</p>
<p>景德鎮磁器生涯不甚旺</p>
<p>九江的磁器店要比南昌多，大槪有一百家的光景，你走不上五步路，就有一家磁器店，店裏貨物的花色也要比南昌繁得多了。這裏直接可通磁器的產地景德鎭。景德鎭製成的磁器，可運到鄱陽湖，再由鄱陽湖轉遝到　陽江，就在九江靠岸卸貨。而南京，上海，漢口，販賣磁器的人也都順着江流到九江來販貨。磁商吿訴我：今年的生意不十分旺，賣去了貨物，以賣出的價格補不進來，而且很多地方都因烽火而交通受阻，生意受着重大的打擊。</p>
<p>徐祖詒報告江防可無慮</p>
<p>九江最近米偎時昂，幾天功夫每担由四十萬元躍至七十萬元。指揮部一位官佐吿訴我：「軍部吃的是軍米，米的漲價是不應該的。非但米漲價，而且一切物價都隨着漲上去了。」爲了關心軍事，一度去訪白崇禧部長。白部長因公外出，由參謀長徐祖詒茶會招待我們，由於這次的招待會，使我們獲得了很多的戰事消息。又使我們知長江北岸有國軍防守，南岸有保安隊防守，江中有海軍防守，江防可吿無虞了。</p>
<p>甘棠湖小遊折返南昌市</p>
<p>九江有一個甘棠湖，湖中有烟水亭，相傳爲三國時周瑜練水兵之處。我們　湖　遠眺，看見一艘艘漁船，張着網逡巡於甘湖上，構成了一幅平和的圖畫。</p>

<h3>英國足球的起源（下）</h3>
<p>— 樂秀榮</p>
<p>這杯賽後拉　成為英國各種杯賽的標準，　全世界最聞名的足球杯賽。</p>
<p>却令治杯賽於一八七一年開始，第一届參加者十五隊，三隊棄權，最後決賽，皇家華特爾斯隊以一比零在凱寗登勝皇家工程師隊。初期到塲捧塲者，僅爲兩隊之關係人，漸漸的直到現在，已成為英國顴骨注目的足球貝決賽了。</p>
<p>一八七八年華特爾斯隊運勞年，照當時的規定，該隊獲得該銀杯，不過他們又送給了是球會。不料到一八九五年亞斯通維拉得勝該杯，在伯明罕展覽，該銀杯突吿失竊。一九一一年製成了第二杯，送給那時的足球會會長金那Bord　Kinnaird，感謝他對於足球賽的功績。同時足球會決定再製一個更富麗的銀杯，這就是每年有五百個球隊參加角逐的第三個銀杯。</p>
<p>一八九二年以前，決賽都是在凱寗登球塲舉行，此後直到一九四年在克列斯托皇宮。第一次大戰之後，改在史丹福橋之吉而喜球塲，自從一九二三年起，則在溫勃萊大運動塲舉行。（按明年世界運動會亦在此）。</p>
<p>一八九三年起，足球會又舉辦業餘杯賽，每年參加球隊約計四百隊。却令治杯和業餘杯，都完全置在足球會管理之下。</p>
<p>根據比賽規則，並無球隊分派門票的規定。但是在一八八七年，規定複賽以前門票的收入，平均由比賽的球隊分派·一八八九年，又規定參加複賽的球隊，可獲得門票百分之五十。但傳至今日，決賽門票，足球總會獲得三分之一，複　得五分之一，複賽以前的門票，使得一極小都份。去年起，各球會的門票攤派，都又增加了。（完）</p>

<h3>省市銀行與商業行荘往來　財部規定變通辦法　限制拆放數額並須翌日收回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕依照經濟緊急措施方案中，加强金融業務管制辦法第三項規定，省市銀行多餘款項應一律存放當地中央銀行或國家行局。茲悉：財政部　根　各省市銀行，省市政府及銀錢業公會等函呈，以省市地方銀行負有調劑地方金融之責任，未便與商業行荘斷絕往來；且與商業行莊亙做拆借基於亙助，爲期甚短，似不致助長投機，亦與經濟緊急措施之規定，尙無抵觸，請予變通等情，核尙切要。爲安定金融適應事實需要起見，特規定辦法六項：</p>
<p>各省市（院轄市）銀行如當地銀根緊迫，商業行莊發生資金上之困難時，在不妨碍本身業務原則下，得因常地信用素著，業務正常商業行莊之請求，核辦短期拆放。</p>

<h3>紡織呂外銷委會申述　紗布外銷最有希望　補充原棉充實內銷均能顧到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡織呂外銷委會頃對紗布外銷之需要，對記者發表意見如次：</p>
<p>一，國內原棉供應不足，爲紡織業當前嚴　事實。本年國棉能收購供給紡織業用者，估計祇能達四百萬　。而全國已開工紗錠，需原棉八百萬担．是除國棉之外，尙不敷四百萬担，折合印包爲一一〇萬包，當恃外棉輸入以補充之。此項數字之外棉，以美金現値計，爲一億五千八百四十萬美金。以印棉現値計，爲五億二千萬羅比。此項外匯之支付，縱不能全部以紗布輸出抵償，至少亦應抵償其一部份。否則雖欲輸入，亦勢有所不可能。假使原棉不能如數補充，生產當然隨之比例减少。除大大影響於民生日用外，停工失業各　嚴重問題，隨之而生。</p>
<p>至於掉換印棉辦法，亦尙有其優點。不獨可以輸進原料，增加生產，並且可以充實一部份內銷。實在言之，棉花換久之後，成品輸出僅爲一部分工資之輸出而已。况且現在所訂合約，第一批係先將棉化運到上海之後，再將紗布在上海起運。又規定一次可以六個月生產紗布十分之一換棉，是從訂約之日起，向後計算，絕不影響於當前內銷。</p>
<p>二，我國外銷物資，茶葉有印錫，生絲有日本勁敵，當前大豆，美國近年生產大增，亦將遭遇打擊。今後出口最有希望者，爲紡織品。南洋羣島所銷紗布，數　頗大，戰前爲日本所佔領，勝利之後，日本退出，紗布極度缺乏，我國早應起而代之。倘我國紡織品再不於此時爭取此市塲（近東菲洲亦應同時爭取），將來外銷，或者整個紡織業，將無從發展．</p>
<p>總之，在今日國家外匯相當支絀，國內棉花生產不足，供應現有紗錠，國際紗布市塲，必急爭取之情形下，輸八棉花，紡成紗布，僅取其中七分之二外銷，以抵償其所付外匯，廠家復獲得相當利潤，是一應積極推進而牧善備之事業。惟恐外銷數量受競爭影響，不能於一定期間達到預定耳。</p>
<h3>銀錢業公會請發大額票　呈文已送達國行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行某負責人昨語記者稱：本市銀錢兩公會爲解決現鈔收解問題，呈請發行大額票面鈔劵之呈文，業已送達國行。渠表示：國行對此事並無意見，將呈請政府作最後之決定云。</p>
<h3>統債外股平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨形勢十分呆滯，成交不過三百萬。各債升沉咸微，統丙晨開二四七〇〇元，低價不過二四一〇〇元，臨收尙穩。五五二室買進，五〇三室三六〇室五五五室均有供給。結果較上週六計甲乙挫一〇〇元，丙種跌三〇〇元，統丁升一〇〇元統戊平平。</p>
<p>外股亦無特殊變化，港申電雖有回縮，但刺激不大，怡紗之起仆，十分狹窄，開價三五六〇〇〇元，低價三五一〇〇〇元，而後轉盤。廣帮洋行帮賣出，銀行帮及散戶略買。結果較上週六計電軍電話平平，藍格志跌一成，航業降半成，紙版小升，餘均徹挫。</p>
<h3>銀根仍緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨銀根仍緊，暗息一角二，華股　息二角五分五，四行二局差入九六二億，中央入五三五億，大交換出三五九億，外商入五四一億，小交換出一四四億，中幾入一三七億億，合作金庫入一五〇億。</p>
<h3>錢業扶掖小工商　舉辦小額貨放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市錢業界領袖沈日新等，以該業經營原旨之一，係在扶掖小型工商業之發展，及融通小額資金之週轉，故決發起組織錢業貸款銀團，設置管理委員會，舉辦小本借貸及小額放款兩種，前者以小型工商業爲對象，後者以公敎人員爲對象，聞預定貸額，最高定爲五百萬元，月息五分，並已推定十五人，定今日召開小組會，擬訂組織及貸放草案，待提交錢業公會理監事會議通過後照辦云。</p>
<p>P&gt;買戶觀望·逢低吸納　紗花布市况平穩</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開平穩。塲中情勢，以銀根仍緊，新買絕鮮活動，業內人受頭寸之軋緊，頗多忍痛斬售，致四十二支藍鳳細紗一度低至四千七百五十萬元。後因各帮見價小吸納，收價回好至四千八百萬元。較之週六，軋落二十萬元。此外除卅二支及特雙馬金城等紗軋升三五十萬，其他十六支等大部軋挫二·三十萬至四五十萬不一。</p>
<p>棉布</p>
<p>初開以週六紡建供售甚充，價曾一度下　，旋因利買消息，客帮垂靑　　，本街亦有動辦，散戶抵補亦殷，午收復見回昂。結果十二磅龍頭等各檔細布回漲自五千至一。二萬元，漂布亦軋升三，四萬，華股昨以各項消息尙難澄淸，人心不定，起仆飄忽。各股榮辱咸微，華豐搪瓷籌碼不暢，一有利買流言，現遞都曾漲達限度。其他各布趨勢，似呈明平暗堅之局。</p>
<p>現棉</p>
<p>昨日現棉市況平庸，紗廠納　微細，交易淸淡。同業做開亦少，市况沉寂，價格無甚出八。成交三五五包，送廠價做開沙市四九六萬，棧交價做開　　五〇八萬四千，涇陽五一六萬七千，漢細四三〇萬，周浦籽花九二萬五千。</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共售一二八三件，合廿支紗二五〇〇·五件，申購共五四七張。</p>
<h3>華股升降咸微　走勢飄忽靡定</h3>
<p>華股昨以各項消息尙難澄淸，人心不定，起仆飄忽。各股榮辱咸微，華豐搪瓷籌碼不暢，一有利買流言，現遞都曾漲達限度。</p>
<p>晨開因大鈔未見實行，及美貸消息而見低。開盤時永紗退至三七〇元及三八〇元，嗣又退至三六去元及三七三元。有人趁低服進，回漲到即交三七四元及遞交三八二元。至是賣出者紛起，塲外息價開高至二角一分及二角五分半，乃逐步迫降至即交三六一元，遞交三六八元低價。業外行市尙秀，近午曾微升至三六五元及三七二元。午收仍退至三六二元及三七〇元。結果較上週六即交股計中絲跌一成弱，中法內衣跌半成，永紗閘北信和美亞新覺景福勤興麗安永公國貨大通統益榮豐微挫，華新火柴中興新亞新華平平，華豐中紡　升。遞交股華豐尙平，餘咸微降。</p>
<p>後市人心略好，聞港電回縮，華豐搪　忽有在九龍設立分廠之訊，買風一起、籌碼有限，現遞均曾漲停。永紗亦升至三七〇元及三七八元。小型股若美亞中絲新光等，亦見秀色。後以交換時小交換報來差出千餘億，國行必定差進，市况又現不支。逐步回小至三六二元及三六六元低價。一五七號及九一號力進而後又被抬上，收市又升至三七二元及三七六元。結果較晨收即交股華豐漲停後有回，軋升成半。永紗信和美亞新光景福勤興中法新華　北內衣中法永公　安國貨中絲榮豐統益微升，中興微降，新亞跌半成，景綸好一成，火柴華新平平。　交股計華豐漲停後有回，軋升成半，餘均徵漲，塲外各去股稍吿回低。</p>
<h3>紡管會新組織年內正式成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國性紡織事業管理委員會之組織，自中樞當局作原則上之通過後，刻管理細則，尙正由紡調會從詳研訂中。聞大致一週內可擬竣呈院審核。委負會可望在年內正式成立，俾於明年起執行管制事宜。</p>
<p>該委員會委員人選，當局決定將不包括民　廠委員。民營廠對此，迄仍保持　默態度。惟　陳束云章·吳味經·李升伯三氏會談時，會擬請束李兩氏參與委員會，並請吳氏襄佐該會業務事宜，惟渠等表示、新委會成立後，度下，國營民營紗廠，地位初無二致，認爲難於參加。又　關係方面表示：新委會成立後，如求管制工作推行盡利，則委員人選，實應有紡織業內超然之人士，二位參加與開，　溝通管制當局與紗廠間之種種困難。使任何辦法之施行，均能推行順利，消除彼此隔閡云。</p>
<h3>食米零化轉暢</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬七千二百餘石，零化轉暢，疲而復振，白梗回升一二萬元，　薄稻猛加二三萬元，白陰元消化活　，挺漲二三萬元。秈米亦加萬餘元，起伏不定，形趨盤旋之局。麪粉初開平正，午時臨收疾升，軋升五六千元。麩皮供少求多，飛奔萬餘元，形勢逐步上漲。豆餅臺灣汕頭續辦，依然挺秀。黃豆客帮揀高略進，油廠仍懈，先定後疲。杜黃南洋染指，微升萬元。</p>
<p>菉豆交淡少神，向榮非易。赤豆仍少做開，呆疲之狀。蠶豆萎靡不振，紅糧北方伴辦，挫落一二萬元。苞米北洋去　轉淡，來源見增，回跌二三萬元。生仁廣帮續納，步砌一二萬元。芝蘇客帮殺短略取，本街吃價亦緊，油廠冷淡，回小一二萬元，黑蘇亦削二萬元。</p>
<p>油市因南洋採辦，生油早市飛奔上漲，午時略淡，結果軋漲十五六萬元。豆油廠方供源尙多，跟漲三四萬元。菜蔴油相繼上升三五萬元，淸油亦高三四萬元。</p>

<h3>徐柏園演講　「管制金融」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財次徐柏園昨在上海金融問題研究會演說，題爲「管制金融」。徐氏謂根據財部九月底之資料全國各種銀行機構，包括國家行局，省市銀行，縣銀行，商業銀行，錢荘，銀號，信託公司，保險公司，在內，總數共達五六六六單位。其中總機構佔一九四一單位，分支機構佔三七二五單位。爲數之多，僅次於美國，而爲其他任何國家所無。政府於戰時對金融機構之設置分佈，特別注意三個原則：　　勵金融業在內地增設機構，以靈活內地之金融週轉，　限制沿海沿江大都市內金融機構之過份集中，以免游資作祟，　取締地下錢莊以保障社會信用之安全。而現階段之金融管制，消極方面在做到消滅金鈔黑市及取締商品囤積；積極方面在領導金融業務配合經濟建設，恢復金融界原有信譽安定社會人心。</p>

<h3>學林叢話（一）</h3>
<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>建設的民治</p>
<p>大戰吿終已經兩年有餘，勝利歡聲早已消逝，世界依然如在隆冬冰箱，不知何日春到人間。戰時盟邦人士都以爲彼此可藉相助的善意，以促進諒解，奈結果則　會重重，美蘇兩大國在思想上的差異校前益深。「民治」二字，美蘇兩國的解釋，大相逕庭，有如劃了一條鴻溝。思想問題實在是目前萬方多難的基本問題。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於民治的看法偏於集體主義。政府爲羣衆或無產階級利益而存在，如果大多數人的利益確能顧到，那麽由何人來執政及政權行使的方法，均屬次要的問題。蘇聯當軸的見解，凡是能爲民衆服務爲民衆犧牲的人，不管其作風怎樣，都是民治主義者。這種解釋彷彿爲目的可不擇手段，英美人士顯然不能認爲滿意。英美對於民治的看法偏於個人主義，以爲個人才是國家的基本單位，凡是公民都應該有充分發展的機會，因爲非如是不足以稱爲民治。</p>
<p>這兩種不相的觀念，原因甚多，宗敎，政治，社會，經濟，歷史，地理都有其淵源有尋。故需要多方面去研究，方能洞見表裏。而在目前激盪的世界，由於蘇聊堅强的壁壘，猛烈的挑　，英美有識人士認爲對於自已傳統文化有重新估價的必要。近年出版的新書頗多表示這種新思想，像美國諾林敎授（George　Norlo）著「美國生活之探討」一書（The　Quest　of　AmericanLife一九四五年哥羅拉多Colorado大學出版）即其佳例。</p>
<p>美國人的祖先渡大西洋入新大陸，以至於發表獨立宣言，他們的動機是在抵抗虐政，反對政府統制。諾林敎授稱，美國人爲「抗議的民族」，（A　protestiag　people）其立國基礎在於個人主義的政治自由。這種精神諾林稱之爲人文主義，他不用自由主義或民治，（德謨克拉西）因爲這兩個名詞，用得太濫，易滋誤解。諾林之意，美國當然還未會達到人文主義的理想境界。但在美國民族發展史上，每到一個新時期，常能對於國內國外的謬妄舉動，掀起强有力的抗議。十九世紀以來，美國肅淸貪汚，修期內政，便是建國精神的又一表現。十幾年前羅斯福總統施行新政，以T．V．A．制爲代表，（拙著旅美見聞錄曾加以介紹，商務版頁五二至五八，）提高政府權力，實施計劃經濟，固然是一種革新運動，又何嘗不是傳統精神。新政的特點在於注重更大的社會正義，實際上美國自建國以來就不斷地在要求社會正義，羅斯福總統把美國的民治由舊轉新，正是發揚美國固有的精神。人文主義的綱領一方面在尊重個人人　，一方面在提高生活標準，有共產主義之所長而去其短。現代世界思潮並非如鴻溝之不可逾越，而爲如　　之層層向上。我們用不　爲思想問題而　憫，自强小息地向上努力，前途一定光明無限。準此而言，目前舉國注目之Y．V．A．計劃，借助於美國的科學和技術，尙是第二義，從建設歷程中切實從事於民治的實騐，才是第一要義。</p>
<p>人境學</p>
<p>英國七十九歲的文　巨星威爾士先生（H．G．Wells一八六六至一九四六）已經殞落。他是一本世紀最大的科學敎育家，把科學和人文學打成一片。他對於物理化學天文地質生物學等具有深厚的根柢，廣博的新知，再憑他超羣軼倫的文才，以文載道，把科學的道理融會貫通，寫成近一百部的著作；包括歷史和小說以及社會問題政治問題的論著。其中像歷史大綱（Outline　of　History）與生命的科學（The　Science　of　Life氏與其長子及赫胥黎Juliaa　Huxley合著）均已譯爲漢文，久爲國人所　慕。他的工作是以整個人類幸福爲出發點，把最近各種專門科學的發現和發明，探究其錯綜的涵義，而細　其共同的原則，並以說明在這個新時時代環境所發生的許多新間題，人類怎樣能推陳出新，自求多福。這一種智識上的努力harp，英人格里哥萊（Sir　RicGregory）稱之爲人文環境學或簡稱爲人境學。（Human　Ecology）見英國自然周刊Nature一九四六年九月廿一日）開創研究人境學的風氣是威爾士畢生最大的貢獻。原來科學但究原因，不問目的。人境學的宗旨在於明天人之際，通古今之變，使科學進步能够發生道德上的影響。靠着這顆炬火的引導，人世間還能抱着新的希望。威爾士是現代新人文主義的代表人物。</p>
<h3>「誠」與學問思辨之功</h3>
<p>— 嚴羣</p>
<p>中庸曰：「誠者，天之道也；誠之者，人之道也。誠者，不勉而中，不思不得，從容中道——聖人也。誠之者，擇善而固執之者也。』（朱子章句第二十章）又曰：『其次致曲，曲能有誠。誠則形，形則著，著則明，明則動，動則變，變則化。唯天下至誠爲能化。」（同上第二十三章）</p>
<p>「誠」者，眞理也。天地之道莫非眞理，故曰「誠者天之道也。」「誠之」者，猶運求眞理也。非惟求之而已，舉凡動靜云爲，亦皆以是爲準，是乃爲人之方，故曰「人之道也。」「不勉而中，」言行；「不思而得，」言知；「從容中道，」謂其於知於行，皆得中庸之道，自然而然，無所勉强。未是之謂「聖」，聖非他，其心身內外，思慮云爲之間，莫非至道定理，所謂「誠者」是已。至道定理，自其眞實無妄之質而言，謂之誠；自其無過不及之態而言，謂之中庸，其實一耳。「誠之者」，其心身之思慮云爲，常加警惕奮勉，以「擇善而固執之」。「善」即無過不及之「中」，亦即眞實無妄之「誠」。至道定理是矣。</p>
<p>擇善而固執之者，致其心之知以求明乎至道定理，盡其身之能而體之行之，以弗失弗墜。此即「致曲」之事。「曲」之爲言，偏也；致者，至也，盡也。偏者，殊事殊物；全者共理公例，所謂「誠」者是矣。「致曲」云者，猶言盡其一曲之知，即考察乎殊物殊事，求知其所以然之故，然後會而通之，而達乎其一貫之共理公例。是乃「誠之」之功。夫生知安行之聖人，所謂「誠者」，累世不一見也，求其次焉者，則所謂「致曲」者矣，故曰其次「致曲」。然而積「致曲」之功，亦將有以至於「誠」，故曰「曲能有誠」。旣至於誠，則內之心之所識，悉爲共理公例，外之身之所行，莫非共理公例之實施；身之所接而爲行者，殊事殊物之有形迹可求者也，故日「形」。無形無迹之共理公例施於有迹有形之殊事殊物，而其效見，故曰「著」。理例著於事物之間，事物悉得其所以然之故，而晦昧者莫不彰明，故曰「明」。明夫事物所以然之故，斯能據其理例，而左右張主乎其間，故曰「動」。動，則變生；變生，則有以因時制宜，隨境取適，其效有非拘虛　習之　所可得而窺焉，故曰「化」。能化，求誠之功至矣，故曰「唯天下至誠爲能化」。由致曲亦有以至於至誠而能化，是人爲與天縱同功，殊途而同歸也。</p>
<p>蓋夫「誠者」，所謂「天蹤之聖」，其所稟德之全且妙，與天道之自然同科；此吾儒之理想人物，所以「繼天立極」，正人倫，定義理，而非人倫義理之所能　，擬於天地自然者也。若夫「擇善而固執之」，所謂「誠之者」，乃其實際之人物，雖非天縱之聖，然以用力之動，積久亦將與「誡者」同功。「誠者」不可得，　求其次焉者，「誠之者」是已。於斯可見，吾儒抱理想，而亦不忘實際也。</p>
<p>至其所示「誠之」之道，「擇善而固執之」之方，則曰：「博　之，審問之，愼思之，明辨之，篤行之。」（同上第二十章）學，問，思，辨，所以擇善；篤行，所以固執。「學」者，察乎物情事態；「博」，猶廣也；廣察物情事態，所以自長其經騐。「審問」者，詳微他人之經騐，以輔益己之耳目所不及也。「思」者，排比分析其經騐之所得，求其會通，而設爲共理公例；然此之爲，率而從事，則偏陂粗　之弊生，故思又不可不愼焉。「辦」者，辦其會通之周不周，所設共理公例之確不確；使其周而確也，則所設者立，而不可復搖者矣。辨不可不「明」，明則所辨者精，而不至於舛誤，求其如此，亦唯廣取實事實物，勘較其所立之理例，以與之相印證耳o「篤行」云者，執其所已立而不可復搖之共理公例，以接物處事，而實收其利用之功也。凡此皆名學之　：「博學」「審問」者，觀察有關之事實，彙而集之，（Observation　for　the　enumeration　of　relevant　instances）內　（亦稱歸納）第一步之功也；「慎思」者，解釋所　集之事實，而造爲臆說，（Explanstion　for　the　establishmentof　bypothesis）內　第二步之功也；「明辨」者，覆構其所　說，（即所設之共理公例）而立爲共理公例，（Establisllmentof　general　principle　from　thehypothesis）內　第三步之功也；以實事實物勘較其所立之理例，以爲印證，（Verification　ofthe　general　principle　by　concrete　instances）內　第四步之功也，若夫「篤行」，則共理公例實施，（Application　ofthe　general　principle）斯又外籀（亦稱演譯）之事也己。</p>
<h3>學問之道</h3>
<p>— 少雄</p>
<p>學問之道，最怕的是一個「蔽」字。有所，便　是有所不見。有所不見，便不能獲得眞理之全，便以一部分的眞理代表全部的眞理，便以非十分眞確之見，代表十分眞確之見。得其一端．即以爲全體在是，不必他求。猶如盲人摸象，各　執所觸及之一部爲象之全體。古今學術之通病，率多類是。荀子論學，主張解蔽。這「解蔽」二字，可謂獨具雙　，最能表現學術精神。學問之道，除此無他。</p>
<p>目前學術界的通病，可說就是1個「蔽」字。許多學術上的爭論，都是由有所蔽而起。例如，有一部分人守舊，有一部分人趨新·守舊派認爲古人的一切都好，學問之道，只有復古，只有讀經，只有發揚古代聖賢的學說，才足以振敝起衰，挽回劫運。趨新派認爲古人一切都和目前的時代不合，都已陳腐不堪，全無用處，非澈底掃除，不能樹立新的基礎。學問之道，在除舊佈新，在介紹新學說，新思想，來代替舊的。這稱新舊之爭，即因各有所敝。守舊派是蔽於古而不知今，趨新派是蔽於今而不知古。言各有當，亦各有不當。明古通今，斯爲得之。</p>
<p>又例如有人認爲我國目前所需要者爲實用科學，所以學校敎育當以實用爲主，一切與實際應用無關的科目，如文學，哲學，甚而純粹科學，都不必加以重視。學問之道，在求實用，而不在空洞之理論。反之，有人認爲學問之道，在爲知識而求知識，在追求眞理，而不化應用。以應用爲目的，足以阻　學問的進展和眞理的發現。西洋科學所以有今日輝煌之成績者，即因西洋人能繼承希臘哲人爲知　而求知識的精神，　脫實用的束縛，方能日進無　，以達今日。這南方面的言論，各有眞理，也各有所蔽。　者　於實用而不知理論，後者蔽於理論而不知實用。眞　正的學問是理論和實踐並重。</p>
<p>上述的例證甚多，我們不能一一枚舉。我們可再舉1例來結束。有人認爲學問之道，在求創造，在新思想的發現，而不在讀書考據，死守古人的陳說。學貴深思，孟子所謂r思則得之，不思則不得也』。不能深思，無學問之可言。然有人認爲，學問之道，不在即求創造，而在讀書，在觀察。學問須有根據，決不能憑空創造。必讀書多，觀察久，然後可言創造。以孔子之聖，且云：「述而不作」，我們安可不讀書而輕言創造呢？這兩方面的話又是各有理由，然也各有所蔽。前者蔽於思，後者蔽於學。思而不學，學而不思，都是不對的。</p>
<p>由此看來，學問之道，即在解蔽。學有所蔽，便會產生許多不必要的爭論。現代英哲懐黑德敎授嘗說：「眞正的發明方法，如飛機之翱翔空際然。飛機之翔空也，由地而起，然後深入雲際。此發明方法，亦由地面之特殊觀察開始，然從躍入海闊天空之想像的概括原理中，由之再降地面，重行觀察，然其觀察已因加以合理解釋之故而較敏銳矣。」在地面能見其細，在天空能見其大，所以須在地面，亦須在天空，主要理由，即在求無蔽。學問之道，其在斯乎！</p>
<h3>鮑桑克底美學述要之一　審美經驗底特性</h3>
<p>— 韓裕文</p>
<p>簡單的審美經騐是一種愉悅的情感，或者對於可愉悅的事物的一種情感。</p>
<p>這裏所謂愉悅的情感，旣是審美的經騐，當然也是一種審美的愉悅底情感，與其他的，如物慾上的，情感自然不同；所謂可愉悅的事物，自然是指美的事物，而不是其他可愉悅的，如解決物慾的，可愉悅的事物。現在提出三點，來說明審美經騐或情感底特性。</p>
<p>審美經騐是一種穩定的情感——我們在可愉悅的事物上，即美的事物上，所感到的快樂和對於飲食所感到的快樂不同。前者是審美的快樂，後者是物愁的。物慾是由於身體底需要而起的一種欲念：當人底身體在生理上有所虧之或不平衡的變態時，他便發生一種不安定的煩惱的情緒，遂即起意追求他所缺乏的東西，以滿足他底欲望，而使其身體在生理上恢復平衡的安靜的正常的狀態。這種欲望底滿足可以呌作饜足。這種意欲底起點是痛苦，終點　足。饜足是牠底目的。在痛苦底解除裏，包含着一種快樂。到痛苦解除了，快樂也隨淸那個追求的意欲逐漸停息了。所以這種快樂是消極的。牠和牠所伴隨的意欲是右時間底程序，而且在她底程序中隨時轉移，有程度上的增减和起減的。審美的快樂是積極的。她是對於完美的形式之一種欣享或成就。你雖然在審美的欣賞裏可以忘掉一切塵世的煩惱而陶醉於完美的境界之中或與之合一，但審美底活動却不是由於煩惱或生理的不平衡而起的。她是最充實的生命底一種創造的活動。在她裏面沒有什麽　乏和要求，也無所謂　足。我們實際的欣賞底行爲誠然不能不在時間裏出現，但就欣賞底性質說，審美底經驗是超時間的，沒有前後際之不同的。我們底心在審美底活動中始終是自在的活安適的（athome），一時的完美猶之永久的完美，頃刻的樂趣，如同長遠的樂趣，並沒有時間的變遷或消長，因此，也不可以終始來說她。我們對於完美的欣賞沒有　足的時候。我們實際上審美的時候，例如在音樂會上，固然也會感覺疲倦，但那不是因為像飲食過度一樣，聽得音樂太多或音樂太美底緣故；而是由於我們底精力不夠而怠工了。審美底要求是沒有蹙足的時候，所以也沒有衰歇的時候。</p>
<p>審美底經騐是一種關聯的或相對的情感——這就是說他是附屬在或相對於一個對象底性質的，同時業可以說牠是一種特殊的，或具體的情感。當我們看見一個東西，或聽到一種聲音，例如聽到飯鈴的時候，我們可以有恨多的理由，例如就要吃飯了等等，感覺快樂；但這愉快的情感若不是由於所聽到那個實際的鈴聲本身而起的，這便不是一種審美的經騐。審美的情感是被－個對象之特殊的性質所引起的。換句話說，他是對於某一事物之特殊的性質而起的一種情感。牠一定得有這麼一個對象，而對牠起特殊的，具體的情感。並且，事實上，這情感和那件事物之特殊的性質是一回事。與審美底淸感相反的情感，例如依乎精力底增長而發生的那種健康底一般愉快的情感，其中也許包含着審美底成分，或者使我們容易感覺到順適的審美底條件；但大體上是一種一般的而不是相關於一個對象的情感。審美底態度裏的情感是具體表現於一個對象裏的。其具體底程度一至於顯然可觀，並且原則上是人人可觀的。</p>
<p>審美底經驗是一種公共的情感。你能把牠訴之於別人，和別人分享牠，這就是「奇文共欣賞」底道理；並且牠底價値是不因爲被人分享而减低的。這就是「獨樂樂不如與人樂樂，與少樂樂不如與衆樂樂」底道理。牠不但可以與人共享，而且可以與人共喻。那就是說審美底情感是明澈的，可以表達的。如果關於趣味的爭論當眞是沒有用處的，那　，關於審美底快樂就恰恰與此相反了。可以說，沒有比審美底快樂討論得更多，也沒有此談論審美底快樂　益更多的事情了。審美底經驗裏最血藥敎育。敎育在其中發生的效果也最大。喜歡什麽和不喜歡什麽，同是到值得稱為審美經驗的文化之路。</p>
<p>以上是審美經驗底三個主要的特性。審美底態度就在其中得到審美底對象。第一點是說審美底情感有常住性。第二點是說審美底情感有相關性。第三點是說牠有共通性。但三者是有密切地連繫的，並不是分別孤立的。</p>
<h3>思維的力量</h3>
<p>— 立人</p>
<p>「存在決定思維，而思維不能決定存在」，這是馬克斯一班人的主張。在這種主張之下，思維的力量似乎被否定了。思維不能影響存在，思維只是存在的反映，存在變動，思維便不能不　之而變動。這樣思雜便成爲最不足輕重之一物。歷史的變動純是存在的變動，思維無力焉。這是否爲事實呢？似如是事實的話，我們便不明瞭人類爲什麽要僅用思維？可是事實並不如此。我們不必從其他方面去我證據，來證明思維的力量，我們只從奉行馬氏主張的人的本身，他們的實際行爲上，便可以找出許多思維有力量的證據來，可以證明他們主張的錯誤。</p>
<p>第一，率行馬氏主張的人，如蘇聯的共產黨，他們所最注重的，所認爲缺少不得的一種策略，是什麽呢？一方面是宜傳，另一方面是統制——思想的統制。前者是積極的，後者是消極的。但不論積極或消極，自我們看來，都是重視思維力量的一種表示。蓋什麽是宣傳？宣傳是想拿自己的思想去影響或左右他人的思想。假如思想是毫無力量，不足輕重的話，爲什麽耍費這樣大的力量去左右他人的思想呢？又假如思想不能決定存在，則任何　爲或有毒的思想，其流行是毫無關係的。我們便　　僞的思想，自生自滅就是，何必加以統制呢？統制思想，即是似定思想爲有力量的，足以影響他人及改變存在的。所以就共產黨之注軍宣傳及統制思想而論，無形中便肯定思維的力量了。</p>
<p>第二，就蘇聯目前的狀况來說，蘇聯所以造成今日的狀况，究是歷史的必然？抑爲思維的力量？依美哲諾索洛氏（F。SC。Northrop）之意，認爲蘇聯之所以造成今日的狀況，並不是因為有什麽必然而使之如此，却大部份是因為蘇聯革命的領袖採取馬克斯的哲學理論，强使他人接受，及把他們的政治行動和文化機構，建築於馬氏理論之上，而使之如此。所以今日蘇聯狀况之所證明的，不是生產關係之物理的存在決定個人關於政治社會的信仰或思維，却是馬氏的哲學，馬氏的思維，決定今日蘇聯的社會制度和生產關係。（參閱所著「東西相會」The　Meeting　ofEast　and　West一書二四六頁）硏究蘇聯革命及其現狀的人，就是共產黨徒，也決不敢否認馬氏哲學的力量。這豈不是又證明思維的力量嗎？</p>
<p>可見思維的力量是無法否認的。否認思維的力量無異否認人之所以爲人。人之所以爲人而異乎禽獄的，主要之點，即在人類有思維。人類能戰勝　　，能克肌自然，而生存以迄今日的理由，也全人類之有思維。一部人類的文化史，大部分就是人類的思想史。思維無力量，決不會有今日人類的文化。歷史的進展，一方面固是存在本身的進展，另一方面也是人類思想的進展。存在自然可以決定思維，但思維也一樣可以決定存在。馬氏哲學之蘇聯便是一個最顯明的例證。</p>

<h3>飲酒篇</h3>
<p>— 平公</p>
<p>飲酒大非易事。有些人以爲自己「能」飲酒，祇因爲他黃酒能喝三斤五斤不醉，伏特加也許一口氣便能喝完一大玻璃杯。但是，喝得最多的人能不能就算是喝午最「好」的人呢？名義的神韵一半在於空白，談話的情趣更大半在于片時的靜默——捧起大杯「牛飲」不休的人，恐怕也祗能呌你想起他眞有些像一只牛罷。</p>
<p>飲酒要能到「恰到好處」的地步，便和尋求生活的恰到好處二樣，自然而然的成爲一種藝術。藝術家在創造一件作品的時候，在熟練的技巧之外還需要突如其來的靈感，這靈感又是飄忽得稍縱即逝，所以不少傑作會在蓓當中便遭遇到了凋謝的厄運。飲酒也有道種呌人難以自主的地方，所以飲得r好」實在是極其難得的。</p>
<p>首先，「酒興」即頗不易得。所謂酒興，我想其實就是心境上偶然感覺到的一點餘暇，無論是白天公務栗六，或者根本無事可作，懶散了一天，到黃昏時忽然感到了「喝一點酒如何」的意念，便把整天的忙碌或者無聊暫且擱開，祇是想飲酒—這時候倒實在是可以喝一點的，因爲祇有在這種時候才可以喝得泰然自得。有些人飲酒已成習慣，不喝便不能睡覺，有些人却以酒爲澆愁之具，以忘却為飲酒的目的—口實可以各各不同，其視酒為鴉片嗎啡則一。他們旣然存心要麻醉自己，如何還能領略飲酒的眞趣呢！所以惟有「無所爲而爲」的飲酒才是真的飲酒，　才能達到陶淵明所謂「欲辨已忘言」的境界。</p>
<p>有人喜歡乾杯，而且還要强迫別人乾杯。酒味還沒膚經過細細的領略，便匆匆忙忙的咽下去了。這種人飲酒像是小學生考試時　繳頭卷，第一個繳卷便算是出了風頭，能不能及格都沒有放在心上。不知酒味其實也可以分「頭」「尾」不同，　乍舉杯時先見了明艷的顏色，馥郁的香味，然後徐馀一口，比時酉色酒香酒味齊奔舌尖，挹芬芳而含瓊瑤，這一口就無妨稱為「酒頭」。於是徐徐下嚥，便似有一綫芳醇頭尚留餘　，這餘馨就姑且稱為「酒尾」罷。茶尚且要慢慢的「品」，飲酒又爲什麽一定要念急忙忙地像小孩子吃藥水，但求下咽之達，不願辨一辨味道呢！友人　谷先生好飲酒，但是很多人不敢和他一起喝，他們說虛谷喝得太慢．他們不知道虛谷惟其能飲慢酒，所以有時能够寫出淸麗的短歌。</p>
<p>有飲酒的心境即是一種淸醒。我這樣說實在並不能算是一種過火的說法，因爲酒興極不易來，而極容易消失。有時，剛剛整治好了杯箸看核，正想小飲，忽然隔壁人家的無綫電裏大唱紹興戲起來了，立刻就會沒有辦法。山陰是產名酒名士的地方，却也產生了令人作惡的紹興戲，大槪也是相生相尅的道理，因为如果不然的话，恐怕大家都要趕到紹興去住，要真正的在「山陰道上」　　一番了。</p>
<h3>秘法</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>記得淸人　記有這樣的一條記載：杭州有一個人賣秘法的，將其法固　在紙袋內，外書某某秘法某某秘法等名稱，有一人以三百錢選購三條，曰「持家必發」，曰「飲酒不醉」，曰「生　斷根」；選妥後賣秘法者復以極　車的語氣對買的人說：「此法　靈，回家秘密啓視，照着去做，慎勿浪傳他人」云云。買者欣然回家，於密室中啓視之，則曰「勤儉」，曰「早散」，曰「勤提」而已，買者大失所望，悔限不已。</p>
<p>本來，秘法是不好拆穿的，拆穿了便不成爲秘法。像柳南隱筆由載工「唐蘇世長為刺史，因民不率敎，實躬引咎，自　於都街，伍伯疾其詭，鞕之出血，世長不勝痛，大呼走，觀者無不摔腹。」這也是一種秘法，可惜的是秘法給人拆穿，結果就不靈了。前面所述杭州人，費了三百錢，買了三條秘法，以為定能如願以償了，而拆開一看，却是這麽平常的幾個字，因之而失望，悔恨，然理不可易，亦不能奈何賣者。我以為這並不是「法」的不靈，「法」已經給你一個絕好的啓示了，你自己認爲它是平常。不算稀奇，那不能怪乎法，只怪你自己不能照着去做而已。世上事情本來都很平常，諸葛亮沒有了不得的地方，其一生惟「謹愼」二字，曾國藩更無他長，其一生惟「所至留心」而已，請試想：所謂「持家必發」，除「勤儉」二字以外，眞有其他的秘法嗎</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>淸末政爭史上之翁李交惡（下）</p>
<p>李商陽（鴻藻）與翁常熟（同龢），以同在軍機相排詆，且各驅土爲戰，前已記之。李慈銘因黨於翁故，其越縵堂日記，醜詆張香濤陳弢庵諸人，詞氣已失檢格。此君心胸素狹，其恨香濤，非盡由於黨見，香濤曾款之失禮，亦爲一因。越縵堂日記光緒三年二月云：「至香濤家，其烏合之僕，見拒尤力，余叱而逕入，坐客次，歷兩時許，主人猶不出，余旣非爲性命忍須臾，又非欲以學問相質，而輕取此辱，閉門不堅，是余過也。」文光緒八年五月云：「近日北人，二張一李（按即指李高陽與幼樵香濤），內外唱和，張則狹李以爲重，李則餌張以爲用，窺探朝旨，廣結黨援，八關後裔，捷徑驟進，示學無術，喪心病狂，恨不得居言路以白簡痛治鼠輩也！」慈銘雖腌詬至此，而檢讀常熟日記，却於香潘無婦詞，且以其特擢山西巡撫爲可喜；反之，香　則必欲留稿以斥常熟，其「廣雅堂詩集」有「送翁仲淵殿撰從尊甫藥房先生出塞」一首，下註云：「　房先生在詔獄時，余兩次入獄省視之，錄此詩，以見余與翁氏分誼不淺，後來叔平相國一意傾陷，僅免於死，不亞奇章之於贊皇，此等孽緣，不可解也。」藥房先生者，常熟之三兄同書，以在皖撫任內爲會國藩所劾，而獲謫遺戍者也。香濤執此以責常熟之無情，不知政治傾軋，骨肉且可不顧，豈以此區區小惠而有事輕乎？香濤此論，誠不通之至！</p>
<p>翁常熟日記似已經其後人改竄（或其生前所自删定，亦未可知），其臧否人物，多留淑評，而少見深刻分析之筆。香藩幼樵，皆其所極不痛快之人，而日記中却反僅存揄揚，殆欲以是示其休休有容，顧史實眞相，不可得矣，此等處，吾以爲李慈銘之祖率豪直，轉較可喜。越縵堂日記記幼樵婚於合肥李氏事，略云：「合肥止一女，繼室趙夫人所生，我把這抵筆款子向銀行裏領回來。」</p>
<p>我把匯條收下來，晚上歸家，跑過後廂房時，就將帶回來的二百萬元交給她們。當我跑到房間裏的時候，老太太連忙走上前來，歡迎着說：「王先生，你來得正好，我們因爲阿龍的錢匯了來，趕快去買了一担米，現在米店裏的伙計正在等著收現款呢。你想，一號的米價還只七十萬，今天已經七十八萬了。像你王先生一號拿到錢就買米，不是要便宜八萬一担！」</p>
<p>我請她把數目點了一點，回到樓上去。心裏在盤算，這位阿龍在小縣城裘，待遇比上海同級的公務員更其淸苦，錢匯到上海敏麗能詩，甚愛之，今甫逾二十，幼樵年四十餘，美鬚髯，已三娶矣。又張佩綸之入贅合肥署中也，仍用三品頂帶，合肥為之行數萬金於海軍衙門，乞以道員蘭放，張欲得四品京堂，而醇邸却之，以慈寗怒佩綸未已也。佩綸漸干預督署事，凡章奏文牘，皆經改作，幕中大鬨，小人失志，猶爾披猖，可歎也。」有見張季直日記者，謂南通對於高陽系人物，亦復不留恕筆，曾引王旭莊與張幼樵絕交書，以證幼樵之深檢云。</p>
<h3>角度</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>我家樓下，後廂房裏住着婆媳二人，兒子在浙東一個小縣城裏當一名公務員，每月一日領到了他的一份「鶴俸」後，進時匯到上海來作家用。這一個月五日，款子匯到，媳婦像平時一樣，把匯款條照例送到樓上來，「王先生，謝謝你給來要經過三四天時間，她家買的一担米，的確是比一號買貴了八萬。</p>
<p>跑進自己房間，好久不見的小張坐在沙發裏等着我，一眼望見了，大家歡然握手：「哈羅，老王，你忙？好嗎？」</p>
<p>「小張，你好？近來米價大漲，你在米市塲裹的賺頭可不差吧？」</p>
<p>小張對我搖搖頭，「不要說起，昨天賣出一票米，至少要蝕掉八萬一祖。」</p>
<p>「怎樣會蝕掉的，不是這幾天米價報漲嗎？」</p>
<p>「就是壞在報漲上面。我是七十八萬元拋出的，你想這幾天南北市塲去胃來得活躍，市塲裏扳緊價鈿不放的人，不知多少。據說不到1禮拜，就再要漲起一成。我是為了鄉下寫急信來，等着付出一筆蓋房子的定洋，不得不忍痛　牲，像大廉價一般賣出去了。你想，如果再漲起一成，不是又中跳上八萬光景，如其等着高峯，比了現在，我是蝕掉了一段頭寸了。」</p>
<p>閑扯了一會，小張去了，我米價的消息，據說米價不致上漲，因爲產地不漲，當局正在竭力設法疏通來源，預料不日即可下跌，至七十萬元左右。同時當局正在籌備民生日用必需品之統配政策，貸款停放，預料一般物價，將受此刺激，一致傾瀉，因此米價的回落，乃是必然的情理中事云云。</p>
<h3>藥貴於血</h3>
<p>— 施白蕪文高龍生畫</p>
<p>據說，直到今天，全中國都會的小兒科醫生仍以重慶爲最好而且最多，抗戰期間，當然全國名醫都集中在陪都了，之後，大家都復了員，名　們類多想留下的也留不住了；惟兒科却依然門應若市。</p>
<p>最初，我以爲田於重慶市的市民着重「保幼」，問起來，却並不然，「祗是中層階級的公教人員的孩子多病」，一個小兒科權威的意見：「孩子大抵是腸胃不調，而不調的原因則由於『打牙祭」制度。」</p>
<p>在重慶住過的人，對於「牙祭」一詞大抵不會太陌生，那是由於平臼營養太劣的人，定期—一星期或十天至半月—吃一次較好的菜饌，以補充其不足之熱量。猶云，牙齒和口腹太苦了，週期地「祭」牠一下，「事之以胙」云爾。</p>
<p>於是半飽狀態的公敎人員的孩子有福了，不打牙祭則已，倘一打，便餓虎撲食似的塡滿了胃腸，不　肥甘的胃腸經此一祭，安得不病！</p>
<p>儘管平時無法「俯畜」便飽，病了，却不能不　衣典　以　之。</p>
<p>可是病却真醫不起，至少公敎人員如是。以藥品論，重慶至少比上海貴二三倍至五六倍不等，難則一切物價號稱比上海便宜。從上海運來一千CC的美製葡萄糖鹽水，前一個月，上海價格在七八萬元時，重慶已經費到四十五萬一瓶了。於是號稱慈善事業的敎會醫院門前，經常停着若干「滑筆」，而滑竿上是交不起住院費的人，有的等着家屬奔走乞貸，有的已經不及等待急救，死在滑竿上了。——大家都知道重慶的敎會醫院早已沒有一文錢教會的補助，有賴於營業收人，自給自足。</p>
<p>我親眼着見一個在校考第一名的十五歲女孩子—我願向上帝發誓沒有說謊—因為父親—一個中級公務負無錢急治而死，一個從事廿年以上的文化人無力置備美國血漿，而祗好用自己的血輸給太太以救殘喘。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第三章　台上與台下</p>
<p>徐渚齊那晚由給紈家裏回來，腦筋裏牢牢印住綺紈嬌憨而帶豪爽的印象，覺得外問所傳綺紈自高身價，脾氣不好，對家庭不陸等等完全不對；今天初次見面，她竟把所受磨折，全說出來，可見她性情很爽直。她爲力求上進，不斷奮鬥，是很有志氣的一個女子，今天給我印象太好了。渚蕭爲了她，那晚顛顛倒倒想了一宿。</p>
<p>第二天在銀行快下班的時候，綺紈送來一封付，信內裝着兩張開明戲院戲票，並夾一紙　，上面用鉛筆草草寫着：「希望徐先生今晚能去，紈。」渚齋看了這封信，立時腦筋又騷動起來，怕同人們看見，和他起鬨，急把信寒在衣袋內，走出銀行，心裏暗忖，送我兩張戲票，我當然要去的，和誰同去呢？行中同人，招惹不得，家裏也沒有人去，祗有找我表妹意雲卿吧，她平日最愛看戲的，對於戲詞也內行，和她去也有個討論。想定主意，便僱車一直趕到多福巷章雲卿家裏。進門一問，章老太已去天津，只有章小姐在家，渚齋一直到樓上，雲卿正在屋內織毛衣，見渚齋進來，她坐着不動，祇點點頭道：「表哥，好幾天沒來了，我母親去天津，我一人在家怪悶的。」渚齋走至跟前，由衣袋內，拿出戲票道，「你沒事，我們今晚看戲去。」雲卿一見戲票，便伸手接過來問道：「是誰的戲？」渚齋道：「是顧綺紈在開明戲院。」雲卿笑道：「我是問你什麽戲？」渚齋給她一問也楞住，搔着頭道：「什麼戲，我還不知通呢！」雲卿笑道：「請人看戲，却不知道是什麽戲！」渚齋道：f沒關係，看一看報就知道了。」說着拿起茶几上報紙一看，又大呌道：「好，好！是綺紈演的人面桃花。」雲卿道：「人面桃花這齣戲生得很！」渚齋道：「人面桃花是崔護惜別　　兒故事，是一齣言情好戲，由綺紈演來，一定纏綿動人。」雲卿道：「你沒看過她，怎麽就知道？」渚齋道：綺紈最善演這一類的戲，你不是也愛看這一類的戲嗎？」雲卿微微一笑道：「你是戲迷。」渚齋道：「我不是戲迷，我覺得我近來生活糊裏糊涂，也好似做戲一樣。」雲卿聽了，向渚齋看了一眼，粉險上頓　笑容，慢慢低下頭去，心上似有無限感觸。渚齋站在她背係，見棹上玻璃　下，自己送他的相片，仍端端正正放在那裏，那張半身像片，已加上顏色，上得非常調和。</p>
<h3>校友與母校</h3>
<p>— 生雪</p>
<p>北洋大學校長虛懸，與狀蒸觀，南方則有王寵惠王正廷等老校友電致劉仙洲勸　，北方則有譚炳訓諸校友奔走維持，他們雖已離校多年，而對於母校關切之熱情，不下於在校之學生會。</p>
<p>今夏，北大接收端王府工校時，許多老校友（即前工業專門學校及北平大學工學院畢業者）紛紛作護校運動，除開會，發傳單，發專電外，至接收時，他們會同在校的護校學生把大門關閉，把各實驗工廠儀器　緊緊把守，而對接收人員竟至發口大駡。去　北洋接收時情形亦復相同，一面反對歸併他校：一面電致敎部要求　立經費，獨立學院。又如師範學院，唐山工學院之要求復大，無不有校友　學生回聲呼籲。</p>
<p>因此回想我自己所親歷的一件事，即民國八年北大改制，把工科移送北洋（北洋的法科則移送北大）。各報登載此消息，被遠在粵漢鐵路工作的老校友知道了，由吳次風領首署名二十餘人，寄我一封長信，內說大學分科開辦即有工科，國家建設需要工學人材，從歷史，從學府，從任何方面，北大並無裁撤工科之理由。畢業同學誼難坐視，　即持此公函代表全體向北大當局力爭挽回，另紙叮嚀數說語：「工科校友，只吾兄一人在京，此事關係重大，責無旁貸，佇盼好音」。我接到此信，亦感覺興奮，即往訪蔡孑民校長！雖單人獨　，勢孤力薄，亦打算效秦庭之哭，盡盡人事。豈知晤談之後、孑翁說此係學制全面革新的一件事，並非工科之存廢間題，若保存工科，勢必全局復舊，礙難從命，請為原諒。我覺得他的話理由充足，事實上無法勉强，即據此回信於數千里外的諸校友。</p>
<p>把以上所述情形，綜合觀察一下，可知校友與母校之關切，　示相當重大之　　。</p>
<p>教職員及學生之　校一切，或者可以說是利害關係（至少有利害的成分），而校友則論學業是畢業已久，而且離校多年了；論職業是早已各有前途，不須倚重母校的了。然而對於母校的升沉離合，竟比在校同學還熱心激越，此是甚麼緣故？</p>
<p>曾與一個校友談起，他說：在外做事，以出身爲憑。旁人問起文憑，來歷，連出身的學校或科系的名詞都不見了，旣非「產於空桑」，又何異於「沒了娘的孩子」！這話因極沉痛，然只是一稱理由、而非根本原因。即此「高等實進學堂」改稱「工業專門學校」，校友們並未因舊名稱之消滅而起反感。「鐵路管理學校」改稱交通學院，亦未有何異　。「工業專門」升格「工業大學」，不但無反對而且高興無比，試問驗文憑的時候，不都是名實不符，所答非所問麽？何以改稱某大學的某學院即認為非常之變，不平則鳴？</p>
<p>由比看來，歷史的感情，自尊的心理，超然於利害得失之外，成爲一種極純潔的先天的根性。此種根性之表現，不必皆合於理解，而實有最可寶貴的價値，就是民族抗戰的最大因素，亦在乎此。</p>
<h3>戒香烟！</h3>
<p>— 亞農</p>
<p>小公務員——筆者包括在內——看去像是個人上人，某實只是「人下人」，至少是大公務員下面的屬員。如果硬要「打腫了臉充胖子」，那就勢必至於比「人下人」還不如，其生活所熬受的隱痛，較之「人下人」爲尤深。</p>
<p>做了小公務員，在外國少不了一件，「舊外套」，正如小說家戈果理筆下的那情形。在咱們中國，也就非拖一件破長衫不可，似乎非此就不足以躋於「人上人」之列。說到香烟這東西，也省不了，戒不了。如果硬要戒烟的話，有些算是最高明的吧，就顯示其政治的見解，說！「予豈戒香烟哉，予實不得已也！」」何</p>
<p>妻傍在我的坐椅上說，「這幾天的來糧，消耗得特別快，親戚川流木息的來，每天來吃飯，你看上月底買的米已經吃掉半担多了，怎麽好，要不要再去買一担？」</p>
<p>室中　　着我噴出來的烟霧，窗外的卡車聲震耳欲聾，房間裏倒顯得寂靜了。以故？曰：一則響應節約運動也，再則培養廉潔風氣也。至於無錢吸烟，那即使掛在嘴裏，也實在不如悶在肚裏的好。凡事從政治的觀點看。個人呌窮，在從前不如說君子固窮；在現在則大可套用一句整個國家都在窮困狀　中，這說法豈不更響亮更有力嗎？又何樂而不為！</p>
<p>更可憐的訪是眞正的小公務員了，在目前交通梗塞，百物騰貴的情形之下，「生活難」，是掩蓋不下去了，長衫范萬脫不下，香烟則想戒而未戒，或旣戒而又吸，陷於所謂藕斷絲連的情况者，比比皆是。其精神狀戊一如上海人打話，難於向情　之泣別。香烟，在他們，簡直是哀感頑　，纏綿悱惻的香君（自然不是歷史上的李香君！）。當其臨別前，往往先减少來往的次數，跟香君敷衍門面；然而，敷衍門面，固屬可憐，虛與委蛇，慾　難塡。過些時候，似乎又覺悟到沒有錢不能吸烟之苦，跟香君「情誼雖好，交必金錢；度德量力，難與周旋。」於是，戒了吧！然而猶不免於呻吟：「無造孽錢，力有未逮，非愛不專，實逼處此！」這就好像大談「苦衷」，要求對方「曲諒」的樣子。可是，香烟畢竟不是活物，憑您呌破喉嚨，喊千聲萬聲「去矣香君，曷勝黯然！」黯然也只是你公務員自己一人而已，對方是全不領情的。你不僅不肯硬心地說：「從此絕交，各自分飛，」相反的，你倒是裏泣似的說：「暫時別離，後會有期，情况許可，再聚團圓」。</p>
<p>將來也許有一天，你的上司或者僚表。敬你一枝香烟，你也就會感到像有情婦賜你一吻似的快活無涯，而且樂於接受這一吻了。試間：一般人掛在口上的所謂節約，與這位小公務員口上的戒烟，其間究有什麼差別？筆者之所以為之黯然者，其原因也就在此。</p>

<h3>Assisting Our Government in Guarding Territorial Waters: Sino-American Naval Agreement Signed; Many Gratuitously Transferred Vessels Already Delivered</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The Sino-American Naval Agreement signing ceremony was held at 4:00 PM on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese side was represented by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie (Naval Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing was detained in Qingdao on official business and unable to return), and the American side was represented by Ambassador John Leighton Stuart. First, each signed two copies held by their respective countries, followed by an exchange of signatures. The entire process lasted only five minutes. Mr. Wang and Ambassador Stuart each handed the signed copies to the other party and shook hands in mutual congratulations, concluding the ceremony. Zhou Xianzhang, Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters, Liu Shirshun, Political Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ling Qihan, Director of Protocol, Hu Qingyu, Director of the Treaty Department, Li Ziming, Director of the American Affairs Department, as well as Mr. Clark, Minister of the American Embassy, and Colonel Oswald of the U.S. Military Advisory Group were all present to witness the ceremony.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Dr. Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, representing the government of the Republic of China, and Dr. John Leighton Stuart, Ambassador of the United States of America to China, representing the government of the United States of America, signed the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America regarding the transfer of naval vessels and equipment in accordance with Resolution 512 of the 79th Congress of the United States of America at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 8th.</p>
<p>This agreement implements Act 512 passed by the 79th Congress of the United States on July 16, 1946, and approved by the President of the United States, to gratuitously transfer certain naval vessels and floating drydocks exceeding the needs of the U.S. government to the government of the Republic of China. A significant portion of the vessels included in this agreement has already been transferred to the Chinese Navy under lease-lend provisions. These vessels are now nominally being recalled and transferred to China under the terms of this agreement.</p>
<p>The transfer of these vessels to China is to assist the Chinese government in defending its coastal and inland territorial waters and to safeguard and improve the safety of navigation in its territorial waters. None of the warships exceed the size of escort destroyers.</p>
<p>The agreement also provides for technical information and advice regarding the organization, maintenance, and supply of the naval institutions of the Republic of China. December 8, 1947.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The Sino-American Naval Agreement signed in Nanjing is to implement the act passed by the U.S. Congress on July 16, 1946, regarding the transfer of surplus naval vessels to China. This act was proposed by U.S. Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and approved by President Truman to assist China in establishing a navy with a total tonnage of 300,000 tons. The transferred warships consist of 271 surplus vessels of the escort destroyer class, including two destroyer patrol vessels, twenty-four minesweepers, twenty-eight submarine chasers, one hundred and ninety-three landing craft, two repair ships, three oil tankers, one survey vessel, six motor torpedo boats, six pontoon rafts, six light ferries, and two mobile floating docks and much other equipment.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] According to the Sino-American Naval Agreement signed in Nanjing on the 8th, the earliest of the 271 vessels gratuitously transferred to our country by the U.S. side were the eight leased escort destroyers Taikang and Taiping led by Lieutenant Colonel Lin Zun, minesweepers Yongsheng, Yongshun, Yongding, Yongning, submarine chasers Yongtai, Yongxing and the transport supply ship Emei transferred later in Qingdao, which arrived in Shanghai on July 19 last year. After the gratuitous transfer act was passed by the U.S. Congress and approved by President Truman, and announced by the Department of the Navy, a portion of the U.S. Navy landing ship fleet serving in the Far East began to be handed over to our country, jointly handled by our Seventh Fleet and Naval Training Corps in Qingdao. By September of this year, the vessels received included ten tank landing ships Zhonghai, Zhongquan, Zhongding, Zhongxing, Zhongjian, Zhongye, Zhongyu, Zhongji, Zhongcheng, Zhonglian, each with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, six medium landing ships Meizhen, Meile, Meisong, Meigai, Meipeng, Meisheng, each with a displacement of 912 tons, six infantry landing craft Lianzhen, Lianbi, Lianguang, Lianhua, Liansheng, Lianli, each with a displacement of 380 tons, and five tank landing craft Hezong, Hequn, Hejian, Heyong, Hecheng, each with a displacement of 279 tons, totaling 28 vessels including the largest transport repair ship Emei (displacement 15,000 tons), with a total displacement of 64,000 tons. Apart from a portion that has been formed into a fleet for service, a portion is concentrated in Qingdao for the training of naval officers, and the remaining gifted vessels continue to arrive in China. The agreement on the 8th is a general treaty provision for this transfer work, so that this work can be quickly completed on a certain basis.</p>
<h3>Expanding Military Advisors: Preliminary Plan Underway</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] This agency has learned from reliable sources that the U.S. Congress or President Truman has instructed to provide the Chinese government forces with comprehensive military assistance. The U.S. Military Advisory Group is about to expand, and its preliminary plan is underway on both the Nanjing and Washington sides. Although responsible officials declined to comment, according to the most reliable estimates, U.S. senators have repeatedly requested direct assistance to the Nationalist army. Once passed, the total number of advisors for the army, navy, and air force will increase to 5,600, allocated as follows: Army, at least 3,600 (currently 300); Air Force, 1,600 (currently also only 300); Navy, 300 (currently only 116). Washington has not yet expressed its position on this expansion, but the U.S. government has no choice but to consider it due to repeated requests from members of Congress and those who are concerned about the situation in China. The expansion plan will naturally focus on General Lucas, the head of the Army Advisory Group, for two reasons: first, China's current military problem is land warfare; second, the members of the U.S. Navy and Air Force Advisory Groups, according to the original plan, if fully implemented, are already sufficient for expansion. The Army Advisory Group is currently taking the first step of participating in the direct training of Chinese troops in Taiwan. According to experts, the authority of the advisors must be extended down from the Ministry of National Defense to the regiment level in order to be effective. If so, the current number must be increased by five to ten times. The Navy Advisory Group currently has only one-third of its approved personnel. Rear Admiral Murray, the head of the group, declined to comment on increasing the number, but it is heard that expanding to the prescribed number would allow every warship in the current Chinese Navy to have an advisor, and there would also be a considerable number of advisors in the naval academies and headquarters. The Air Force Advisory Group, headed by Brigadier General Thomas, is implementing the plan passed by former Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen and President Truman after the victory over Japan, in which the United States would provide advisors to the Chinese Air Force, down to each detachment, in order to effectively train personnel. This plan was drafted by General Stratemeyer, then commander of the U.S. Air Force in China, but only a portion of it was implemented, with the number of personnel assigned less than one-fifth of the prescribed amount. According to informed sources, the United States is currently actively pursuing a plan to maintain 54 air squadrons, which has caused aviation experts to feel that it is insufficient. If China wants to obtain sufficient U.S. Air Force personnel to complete its original plan, it will inevitably be somewhat difficult. In addition, there is another issue related to the expansion of the advisory group, which is the supply of housing in Nanjing and other places, which is also being considered. The Chinese government has had considerable difficulty in providing housing for the existing advisors, causing many senior military officers to be unwilling to be transferred to China to avoid prolonged separation from their families.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Sino-American Tobacco Loan: Tobacco Merchants' Association Unaware</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is rumored that a Sino-American tobacco loan has been established, amounting to $30 million, managed by a foreign company manager in this city. When reporters inquired about this matter with the Tobacco Merchants' Association, they said that they were unaware of it. Two weeks ago, the Tobacco Merchants' Association, hearing rumors that a soon-to-be-successful American loan would be paid with six or seven kinds of materials, with tobacco as one of them, immediately submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance requesting that tobacco imports not be allowed, on the grounds that: commodity loans should be limited to those beneficial to national construction, tobacco is entirely a consumable, and our country can produce it ourselves. As evidenced by the fact that domestic tobacco was able to be self-sufficient during the War of Resistance, allowing large quantities of American tobacco to enter at this time would bankrupt domestic tobacco farmers. In the past, the Tobacco Merchants' Association has fought with the Transportation Control Committee to reduce the import quota for foreign tobacco. As a result, the quota has been reduced from $8 million in the first quarter to $5 million, and the $3 million saved has been used entirely to purchase paper for domestic needs. Allowing part of the loan to be paid in tobacco at this time is a form of disguised dumping, which is detrimental to both national economy and people's livelihood. The association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday, the gist of which was: the content of the American loan has not yet been determined, and everything that is rumored is not to be deeply believed. The points raised in the document are not without reason and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the National Economic Commission for further reference.</p>
<h3>War Materiel on Pacific Islands: Value Exceeds One Billion U.S. Dollars; Shipping to China Being Destroyed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th Dispatch] U.S. Army officials say that the war materiel being destroyed on the Pacific islands is sufficient to equip many divisions of the Chinese army, but the problem of shipping this materiel to China does not seem easy to solve. According to the Army, there are already more than one billion dollars' worth of supplies on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. On Guam and Saipan, there are rusted tanks, radar equipment, and aircraft, but Army officials say that although Congress is demanding U.S. aid to China, the cost of preserving this materiel will exceed its original value, but it is much less than the cost of shipping it to China.</p>
<h3>Opening Gold Trading: Finance Ministry's Four Principles Unchanged; Silversmiths Petition Transferred to Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] The silversmiths' request to open up gold trading to maintain their livelihoods has not been resolved for several months, and silversmith representatives continue to petition. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance on the 8th, the silversmiths' petition has been transferred to the Executive Yuan for approval, but the basic attitude of the Ministry of Finance remains unchanged. This basic attitude is: Gold bars cannot be bought and sold absolutely. The Central Bank must not supply gold to silversmiths to prevent it from flowing into the black market. Gold can be bought and sold openly, but the price should be around the market price of $40. The price of gold jewelry can be regulated by the local Social Affairs Bureau, and the legitimate profits of the silversmiths should also be taken into account. The Ministry of Finance finds it difficult to allow gold trading beyond these limits.</p>
<h3>In Order to Meet Actual Needs, the Government Should Issue Large Denomination Notes Above 10,000 Yuan Quickly: An Economist Discusses the Current Financial Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] "The government should issue large denomination notes above 10,000 yuan as soon as possible to meet actual needs. Currently, even transactions of slightly larger amounts in the market are already suffering from a shortage of chips. If the government does not solve this in time, the end of the year is approaching, and various industries will need more cash. At that time, adverse phenomena such as high premiums may occur. If the government then seeks remedy, it will be too late." This is the conclusion made by an economist to reporters after analyzing the current financial situation. He said that the National Federation of Commerce and the National Federation of Banks have repeatedly suggested to the financial authorities to issue large denomination notes immediately because they saw that there was a shortage of chips in the market. Recently, the National Federation of Banks also decided at its board meeting in Shanghai to request the government to issue large denomination notes above 10,000 yuan immediately. However, the authorities, fearing that it would stimulate prices, have not only delayed it but have also denied such rumors. This is actually superfluous. The issuance of large denomination notes is not the cause of high prices. On the contrary, it is because of the high prices that large denomination notes have to be issued due to actual needs. It can also be said that it is the result of high prices. He then compared the current face value of banknotes with the prices, saying: The highest face value of legal tender circulating in the market today is 10,000 yuan, but considering that current prices have increased 50,000 times compared to before the war, today's 10,000 yuan is only equivalent to 20 cents before the war. Before the war, the issuance of legal tender was stipulated to have five denominations: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Comparing this with prices, 1 yuan before the war is equivalent to 50,000 yuan today, and 100 yuan is equivalent to 5 million yuan. From this point of view, if it is said that the government is reasonable in not issuing large amounts of legal tender in order to avoid stimulating prices, then why did the "large denomination notes" of 1 yuan to 100 yuan before the war not cause market chaos and price fluctuations? Facts prove that the cause of stimulating prices is definitely not whether or not large denomination notes are issued. This is only an excuse for speculators to seek profits. Finally, he also suggested that the government should not hesitate to issue large denomination notes. In order to adapt to the needs of transactions, it should not only issue 50,000 yuan notes, but also issue 500,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and even 5 million yuan notes at the same time. However, how to maintain the value of the currency and reduce the amount of issuance is another responsibility of the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] A key official of the Ministry of Finance stated today that the government will issue two types of Customs Gold Units, 1,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan, before the end of this year. The initial distribution work has now begun.</p>
<h3>Government Drafting Important Plan to Solve Current Financial and Economic Problems; General Budget for First Half of Next Year Under Review</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] In order to achieve the goals of securing foreign aid and self-reliance, the government, after deliberation by the Executive Yuan, has decided to draft a plan to solve the current financial, economic, political, and military sectors. This plan is divided into two parts: constructive, with a longer period of application; a short-term, palliative approach to current problems. Regarding the latter, it has been decided that Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, and Weng Wenhao will draft it.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The national general budget for the first half of the 37th year (1948), regarding the departments of the Executive Yuan, has been approved by the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 6th. The Comptroller-General's Office of the National Government will begin reviewing the budgets of the remaining four Yuan (Judicial, Legislative, Examination, and Control) and their affiliated institutions starting on the 8th, which will take about a week to complete. According to reliable sources, the ratio of expenditures in the 36th year (1947) to the original budget is approximately four to one, or even more. On the revenue side, it has also increased by more than double the original budget, but this has further exacerbated the imbalance between revenue and expenditure.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan, Comptroller-General, Discusses Balancing Revenue and Expenditure</h3>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Comptroller-General Xu Kan met with reporters on the evening of the 8th and discussed matters relating to balancing revenue and expenditure and stabilizing prices. He said that the conditions for balancing revenue and expenditure are no more than two major principles: increasing revenue and saving expenditure. In the part of increasing revenue, in addition to reorganizing tax collection, that is, developing new tax sources, production should also be increased to increase the wealth of the people. Next, is raising debt. Regarding the part of expenditure, it is only about reducing expenses. Xu also said that some tax regulations and measures should be revised to conform to the actual situation so that the taxes borne by the people can be turned over to the government. Finally, Xu discussed the issue of prices, believing that several factors must be achieved, such as: A, improving the treatment of officers, soldiers, and public school teachers; B, settling urban, inland, and rural areas for stability; C, engaging in production; D, restoring transportation. In this way, society will be stable, and prices will not rise.</p>

According to estimates from relevant parties, national production will reach 12 million dan in half a year. Apart from approximately 5 million dan for farmers' own use, 7 million dan can be purchased by the government. At the current market price, 7 million dan requires a fund of over 17 trillion, and whether the government can purchase all of it is still a problem.</p>

<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government Decides to Form Exploration Team: To Explore for Atomic Energy Raw Materials; To Depart Next Month to Inspect Uranium Mines in Eastern Guangxi</h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Correspondent, 8th Dispatch] Since the discovery of the atomic energy raw material uranium and uranium mines in Zhongshan and He counties in this province, it has aroused great attention among the people of the country. Minister Bai Chongxi has repeatedly urged the provincial government to explore as soon as possible. The Guangxi Provincial Government has now decided to form an exploration team to conduct surveys next month, and has hired experts He Jie and Cai Chengyun, professors at Guangxi University, to participate in the work, which is expected to be completed within one year. Note: Uranium is found in Huangqiangping, where Zhongshan County in the west borders Pingye. The mine is about 950 meters high and is generally called Huashan. The distribution area is 20 kilometers east-west and 220 kilometers north-south. The minerals are produced in the granite veins in Huangqiangping. Three types have been discovered: 1. Lemon yellow powder and flake-like clumps, which are uranium phosphate minerals. 2. Reddish-brown, ochre yellow, and light green oily crystals, not yet determined to be what kind of mineral. 3. Black, fine-grained, dense colloidal minerals, which appear to be asphalt minerals. The minerals were discovered in the tailings of the Shuiyanba tin mine in the area where Zhongshan and He counties border. After testing, it was proven that there is indeed abundant uranium mineral present.</p>

The bandits have suffered heavy casualties over the past two days. Another group of bandits, numbering approximately two thousand, have infiltrated east of Xixiakou into Huiche Tang, Ba Di Tang, and Yan Gou, where they are being surrounded and engaged in mixed combat by our local armed groups. The Wanxi local armed groups are bravely resisting the invading bandits from all directions.

<h3>Fierce Fighting Expected on Both Sides of the Southern Henan Pinghan Railway; Bandit Liu Cut into Two Sections; National Army Advancing Westward from Guangshan Continues Pursuit</h3>
<p>(Our newspaper, Jiujiang, 8th) Today's battle situation on both the east and west sides of the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan remains fierce. The number of Bandit Liu's westward-fleeing troops is close to ten thousand. Bandit Liu himself may still be directing operations near the Luotian-Xuanhua Dian highway. Although it has been discovered that three columns with the numbers one, two, and ten have sneaked across the railway to the west, it is possible that some of the bandit forces are still entrenched in the Dabie Mountains. Bandit Liu's independent column is mostly composed of local communist rabble, who may remain in the Dabie Mountains. A senior military official told our newspaper reporter today about the battle situation in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area over the past week. The official believes that Bandit Liu's westward flight was within the expectations of the Jiujiang Command's encirclement and suppression plan. Therefore, after the Jiujiang Command implemented command authority on the 27th of last month, in addition to using a large force to pressure Bandit Liu from south to north, it also set up a tight net on both sides of the Pinghan Railway. The westward-fleeing bandits are being beaten everywhere and running into walls. The fighting on both sides of the railway today is part of this plan. Overall, the battle reports today indicate that the war on that front has become white-hot. Minister Bai is currently stationed in Wuhan and sometimes goes to the front lines to direct or inspect the positions. (Nanjing, 8th) The National Army in southern Henan has broken Bandit Liu's attempt to cross the railway. On the night of the 6th, Bandit Liu's main forces, the first, seventh, and twelfth columns, were pressured by the National Army and fled westward through Luoshan and Guangshan, via the Fu Danjiao area. After being ambushed by the National Army in Xinyang and Liulin, they have been cut into two sections. A small group of about thirty who crossed the railway was surrounded by our army on the 7th near Xishuanghe and Tan Jiahe south of Liulin. Fierce fighting continued until the morning of the 8th. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. The remnants fled to the Damao Fan area in the southwest, and the National Army is in pursuit. Its main force is still in the Liulin area, where it is being encircled and annihilated by the National Army. The National Army, which is pursuing and suppressing from Longsheng Town south of Dashan, has advanced to Dashan Chong; the National Army, which is advancing westward from Guangshan, has directly attacked Dupihe. The bandit forces in this area have reached the end of their road and are now scattered in small groups. A small group attempted to flee south to the Jianqiao area east of Guangshui,</p>
<p>while others fled from Fuchuan to Liudian, and on the 8th, they fled again to Gushi. Currently, the National Army is advancing from Lijiaji, Guangshan, and Shangcheng to coordinate with the Gushi garrison and encircle the bandits. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper, Hankou, 8th) The Provincial Senate has telegraphed the central government again, requesting the addition of more troops to defend the north and provide support to Xuan County to secure the Han River defenses. The Hankou-Zhengzhou express train on the Pinghan Railway has recently been suspended due to Communist bandits disrupting the Liulin Station. All trains on the railway will also be suspended from today. The First Column of more than 10,000 Communist bandits at Liulin Station, after being tracked and pursued by the National Army, scattered towards Luotuo and Moshicun on the morning of the 7th. A vanguard of over a thousand people had infiltrated Lijiaji, and the National Army is closely monitoring them. After the Communist bandits were driven out of Liulin Station, the railway was repaired overnight, and one kilometer of the damaged track has been restored.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Technical Problems of Economic Control</h3>
<p>A doctor who only knows how to treat a headache by treating the head and a foot pain by treating the foot, and forgets to examine and treat the entire pathological condition, is definitely not worthy of being called a good doctor. It is not that local and palliative treatment is necessarily completely ineffective; on the contrary, sometimes it has quite good temporary effects. However, physiology is a whole, and the meridians are connected. A local special operation, if the severity is inappropriate, often affects the whole body, deepening the original symptoms.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the current state of economic unrest is due to many reasons. To use a disease as a metaphor, it is like a multiple-illness syndrome. In addition, eight years of war of resistance and two years of internal turmoil have left the country ravaged and its vitality greatly weakened. In addition to careful examination and prescribing the right medicine, we must also pay attention to investigation and recovery of its physical strength. After excessive weakness, if strong and aggressive drugs are administered indiscriminately, excessively weakening resistance, this is certainly not an appropriate method.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how improved or strengthened the economic remedial measures are, we believe that there are several principles that must be taken into account at all times. One is national, or at least city-wide. That is, within the same economic unit, all controls, distributions, and other measures should be equal, universal, and mutually beneficial, so as to achieve a fair and equitable state. Do not favor one over another, and do not focus on one while losing sight of the other, so as to increase public discontent and destroy the results of your efforts. Specifically, all current regional or class-based local measures are theoretically not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The second is liquidity. Whether it is goods or finance, its role lies in free circulation. Unless there are other international policies, so-called free trade is not easily adopted by most countries. Within a country, however, if barriers are deliberately set up between regions, or local authorities are allowed to impose bans at will, hindering transportation, this kind of deformed situation is neither permitted by the central government nor sympathized with by public opinion. For example, regarding the circulation of rice, has the central government not repeatedly ordered that provinces not be allowed to impose bans without authorization? The circulation of customs currency and Taiwan dollars has been repeatedly criticized by all parties for hindering unification. By analogy, the recent measures of the National Bank to control remittances and stop loans should only be regarded as temporary measures and should not be continued for too long. The pros and cons of the situation are explained in detail in a recent telegram from the City Council to the Executive Yuan. In short, the piecemeal blocking measures are contrary to the principle of blood circulation and the free flow of goods, and of course, they are not long-term solutions.</p>
<p>The third is consistency. This contains two meanings: one is the consistency of the measures before and after, and the other is the consistency of the procedures when each agency implements them. If it is advocated today and canceled tomorrow, or even strictly ordered to be banned, such as the past gold policy, export subsidy policy, public utility subsidy policy, textile industry control policy, and the policy of price limits and price negotiations that are sometimes tightened and sometimes relaxed. The reasons for the sudden changes may be justified at the time, but in the general perception, there is always a sense of panic, and merchants especially regret the loss of their basis. We believe that when enacting laws, it is fine to consult widely and carefully, but once the clauses are formulated and officially implemented, they should not be changed in the morning and evening, causing much confusion, and even contradict each other. This is important for the government's credibility, not just for the sake of convenience for the people.</p>
<p>Every law often involves two or more agencies in its jurisdiction. Therefore, in the implementation, it is inevitable to consult with each other, delaying the time. When the consultation is not satisfactory, it is inevitable that each will act in its own way, resulting in duplication and shirking of responsibility. This is a common problem now. In fact, although the relevant agencies may involve two or more, there are clear distinctions between the responsible agency and the assisting agency. As long as each adheres to its duties and responsibilities, it will not easily lead to disputes and shirk of responsibilities. For example, the recently promulgated organizational regulations of the Financial Supervisory Bureau clearly stipulate in Articles 1 and 4 that the competent authorities are the Financial Supervisory Bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, etc., and the assisting agencies are the local governments and related agencies. If the matter involves the responsibilities of other agencies, they may also handle it jointly. According to these articles, the division is very clear and will not lead to the above phenomena. It can be seen that many of the current disturbances are not due to the laws themselves, let alone the lax enforcement, but rather to the lack of understanding of the relevant parties.</p>
<p>In short, laws are dead, but how to enforce them is alive. It is valuable to adapt to the times, weigh the pros and cons, and eliminate the bad habits too much so that the people can be convenient. On the one hand, the government's expected goals are achieved, and on the other hand, the original intention of supporting industry and commerce is not lost. This is to be good at abiding by the law and good at carrying it out. Take the matter of cracking down on hoarding, for example. If the "Regulations on Cracking Down on Hoarding of Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" are strictly implemented according to the letter of the law, universally and strictly, then the transfer and storage of all designated daily necessities must be reported, registered, inspected, priced, sold on consignment, or purchased. In large cities such as Shanghai, it is almost impossible in fact, unless it is intended to suffocate it and make it completely immobile. Because merchants are subject to many restrictions in every move, they will feel very inconvenient, and even the trade associations and competent authorities will not have enough manpower to cope with this matter. However, if speculation is too hot and hoarding is too rampant, if one is not killed as a warning to hundreds and the illegal hoarders who are truly guilty are severely punished, it will not be enough to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, improving the legislation is one thing, and how to use the law well is another.</p>
<p>Another example is the control of yarn and cotton cloth. From the Textile Control Committee to the Textile Adjustment Committee, and then from the Textile Adjustment Committee to the strengthened Management Committee, there are constant improvements in personnel and organization. This is enough to show the authorities' attention and determination. Of course, we also hope that it can actively promote progress and achieve results day by day to achieve the goal of increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, the textile business has passed. Of course, it can be divided into three major parts: How to obtain sufficient raw materials? How to seek consistency between the current decentralization of manual spinning and weaving? How to carefully consider domestic and foreign sales, state-owned and private enterprises, so that each is in its place and each gets what it deserves? If these three major parts can be systematically linked together, coordinated and promoted in a unified way, this is of course management. However, it cannot be regarded as management if only a part of it is handled in a branch or only a fragment is handled in a part. However, the effect is bound to be different.</p>
<p>Economic control is originally an extremely difficult and cumbersome task. In addition to personnel, organization, and light expenses, is the environment suitable? Are other conditions fully met? These cannot be solved by ideals alone. Therefore, it is unreasonable to be pessimistic at the beginning of the promotion or to wait and see, watching success or failure, or to act in a way that is outwardly compliant but inwardly opposed, and unwilling to cooperate. It is also not a balanced argument to expect too much and blame too severely. Our opinion: For things that can be managed in fact and controlled in the situation, it is advisable to plan and implement overall control to increase efficiency; if there are too many problems, it is also a way to broaden the scope of operation and free operation, which is a way to move forward in different ways and achieve the same goal by different paths. In the part of prohibition or crackdown, more attention should be paid to increasing production and maintaining employment. Any means, any name, if the result is only to hinder production or create unemployment, that is not the original intention of the government's legislation, let alone what the general public expects. We have heard the following joke:</p>
<p>There was a hunchback who was sent to a quack doctor by his family for treatment. The quack doctor did not hesitate and simply clamped the hunchback tightly in the middle with two very thick wooden boards. After a while, the hunchback was clamped to death. His family questioned the quack doctor, who replied: "I am only in charge of treating the hunchback. As long as he is not hunchbacked, it is considered cured. As for life and death, that is another matter, and I cannot be responsible."</p>
<p>This is indeed a joke, and I don't think it really happened. But there are many people with a hunchback in the economy now. Those who are expected to treat economic diseases must take into account the problem of life and death, first maintain his life, and then talk about the problem of hunchback, which is the common psychology of the patient's family.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Talks About His Thoughts</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Fu continued to talk about his thoughts, saying: He feels deeply that his responsibility has increased as he takes on the military command of the North China Bandit Suppression. In the short term, he may even suffer some blame and slander, because he cannot create miracles and immediately satisfy the expectations of the people. Talking about the future bandit suppression work, Fu is very confident, saying that the Communist bandits today are "their evil is more obvious, and their crimes are more obvious." The people's certainty of right and wrong is the infinite power to suppress the chaos and build the country. At the same time, the central government has granted the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters full authority to command operations, reorganize troops, and reward personnel. In the future, with the concentration of troops and flexible use, the Communist bandits will not be able to use their tricks. Talking about the precautions for the future, Fu said: He encourages the troops to carry forward the traditional spirit of hard struggle. He humbly accepts the criticism and guidance of the wise and conscious. He asks patriotic compatriots to unite their strength and resolutely suppress the chaos, and hopes that knowledgeable people will vigorously promote and cooperate. He will reorganize the troops, strengthen combat power, maintain military discipline, and strive for military-civilian cooperation. He respects the party and government and cooperates with the party and government. He hopes that patriotic youths who joined the Communist Party for the sake of resistance will join hands with us and share the mission of national construction. We will do our best to rescue the good people who have been threatened by the Communist bandits and be responsible for arranging their future work and life. The military and the people will cooperate to pacify the local area. Fu said: "If the whole body cooperates and makes efforts, I believe that after a considerable period of time, we can pacify the rebellion and stabilize people's livelihoods." Fu said at the end of his speech: "With a heavy heart, I accept the arduous task.

<h3>Commemorative Week at the Central Party Headquarters, Supplementary Commemoration of the Zhaohuo Uprising, Presided Over by the President, Report by Lu</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th) The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week this morning, and at the same time, a supplementary commemoration of the Zhaohuo Warship Uprising. President Chiang presided over the ceremony in person, and Committee Member Lu reported on the uprising and expressed his feelings, saying: Although this uprising failed, the whole country soon rose up in response, and Yuan Shikai finally collapsed. He emphasized that the Labor Revolutionary Party members need to have the spirit of great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage. He pointed out that when the General was willing to give the presidency to Yuan at that time, he had the foresight to believe that once Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, the revolutionary forces could rise up. Later, the General reorganized the party into the Chinese Revolutionary Party and launched a campaign against Yuan, and said that the purpose of leading the revolution was not for personal gain, nor was it for a party or faction, but to overthrow the imperial system that had lasted for thousands of years and to return power to the people in order to build a country of the Three Principles of the People. He continued: At the time of the Zhaohuo Uprising, only one or two warships were available, and the military camp was only a few hundred people, but Yuan Shikai's henchmen were all over the country. However, the reason why they eventually failed and died was entirely due to the great courage of our revolutionary party members. He finally said: After the death of the General, the President inherited his teachings and led the revolution. Although there are many difficulties at present, if our party can continue to carry forward the spirit of great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage, the goal of national construction will eventually be achieved.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Nearing Success or Failure; US, Britain, and France Confer Secretly on Countermeasures; Determined Not to Recognize Pro-Communist Delegation; Dulles Completes Mission and Returns to London</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] It is learned that the Foreign Ministers of Britain, the United States, and France held a meeting on the 7th, without the participation of Molotov. Although it was an informal meeting, it was the first time since the start of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference that a meeting was held by three Foreign Ministers instead of four. Officials did not disclose what Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault discussed. However, it is speculated that the three discussed possible steps to take if the Foreign Ministers' Conference failed. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the purpose of the three Foreign Ministers' meeting was to prepare for suggestions expected from Molotov on treaty differences, rather than to discuss the strategy of how to adopt a [decisive method] in the Foreign Ministers' Conference in the coming week. Reliable sources said that the re-arrival in London of General Clay, Commander of the US forces in Germany, and his political advisor, Fei Fei, from Berlin was related to the [German People's Congress] convened by the German Socialist Unity Party in Berlin, and was not to prepare for the conclusion of the London Conference. It can be almost certainly asserted that the United States, Britain, and France will reject the list of the German Socialist Unity Party in Berlin, as the three countries believe that this list was drafted by a conference of German political parties in the Soviet-occupied zone and cannot be regarded as a delegation representing Germany. However, whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can meet at this stage with a delegation considered to represent Germany is still subject to discussion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] In view of widespread rumors that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has already failed, Foreign Minister Bevin issued a statement from the Foreign Office today, saying that there has been no development to support the claim that this session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has failed. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to proceed as usual at Lancaster House on the afternoon of the 8th.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Marshall's Republican consultant Dulles has returned to London after a three-day trip to France, where he met with the country's authorities. It is said that the results of this trip were extremely satisfactory. Dulles' main purpose in going to France was to explore whether the French government could support the merger of the British and American occupied zones in Germany in the event that the Foreign Ministers' Conference broke down. French Foreign Minister Bidault has indicated here that the French occupied zone is willing to participate in the merger if a breakdown of the conference is unavoidable.</p>
<h3>If the London Conference Breaks Down, the US Prepares to Issue New Currency; To Circulate in Germany and South Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] According to reliable official sources today: If the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference breaks down, the US Treasury Department plans to issue a new currency for use in Germany and Korea. This new currency has already been printed, and three cars have been transported from Washington to Bairokson under strict protection, ready for shipment to Germany.</p>
<p>Authorities have kept this secret for weeks, observing the success or failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to officials in charge of the occupied zones, the German mark and Korean currency will be revalued by the US government to prevent inflation. In Germany, the Soviet Union used printing presses supplied by the United States during the war in 1944 to print military notes in large quantities, flooding the western occupied zones, causing the black market value to fall far below the official price. After the new currency is issued, these military notes can be declared invalid. As of 1945, military notes were redeemed for US dollars at face value, totaling approximately $350 million. The printing of the new currency was approved by Britain. However, when it will be issued, whether it will circulate simultaneously in the British and French occupied zones, and its exchange rate with the current mark remain to be announced. The current mark is virtually worthless. As for Korea, the new currency can currently only circulate in the south. The exchange rate between the current Korean currency and the US dollar is set by the US military government at 50 to 1. The total amount of Korean currency issued before the war was approximately 7 billion. Now, the amount circulating in the south has inflated to 20 billion. The black market exchange rate is 300 to 400 Korean currency to 1 US dollar, whereas it was 50 to 1 before the war.</p>

<h3>Optimistic French Situation, Yet Labor Disputes Hinge on Wage Agreement, Unions and Government Still Far Apart</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, August 8th] Hopes for resolving the strike, now in its third week, have diminished. The Central Labor Commission issued a statement indicating that the government's counter-proposals are insufficient to encourage striking workers to strengthen their position and persist until victory. The strike committee further stated: "The committee cannot agree with the government's attitude towards the main parts of the workers' demands. The strike occurred precisely because the government refused these demands." The biggest point of contention between the National Confederation of Labor (CGT) and the government is the workers' demand for a system to adjust wages in line with the cost of living. CGT Secretary Lebrun stated that the government's proposed minimum wage would be insufficient if the cost of living rose by another 10%. Labor Minister Marius Moutet stated last night that the government would never accept any form of temporary adjustment system. The main demands of the strike committee are: A general wage increase of 1,125 to 1,500 francs per month for industrial workers and civil servants. Effective guarantees for periodic proportional wage adjustments based on the cost of living and a suitable minimum. The Paris subway workers' union decided yesterday to strike for two days starting on the morning of the 8th in response to the symbolic strike of civil servants, but the independent union, comprising about one-tenth or two-tenths of the total workforce, has opposed the strike. According to the People's Daily, the Paris-Lyon express train derailed near Lyon yesterday, caused by someone removing the rail spikes, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>

On the morning of the 8th, when the strike was supposed to begin, Paris buses were still running normally, and the subway workers' union announced the cancellation of the strike shortly after 11:00 a.m. Civil servants were also scheduled to strike on the 8th, but largely ignored the union's strike order.</p>

<p>The Turbulent Prospects of French and Italian Politics (Translated by this Newspaper's Editorial Department)</p>
<p>The Communist parties of France and Italy are currently working to undermine the strategy of the American plan to assist Western European recovery. They will receive instructions from the Soviet Union through the Cominform.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Communist parties of nine European countries recently met in Poland. Judging from the statement it issued, a shift in Communist policy has occurred, which is that the Soviet Union hopes that Communist party members in European countries will become closer military allies of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Warsaw, the new Cominform is openly directing the work of the Communist parties of nine European countries. France and Italy are the two places where the success or failure of the Marshall Plan is at stake, and the Communist parties of these two countries also participated in the Cominform. The other seven participating countries are the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states, namely Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>This new organization differs from the old Comintern in form and nature. The old Comintern was founded in 1919 with the goal of promoting world revolution. After the Soviet Union declared war on Germany, the old Comintern was dissolved in 1943. At the time, Stalin said that the dissolution of the old Comintern disproved the lie that Communist parties around the world were directed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The new Cominform claims to be "democratic and patriotic." The founders of this organization never mention world revolution. Currently, its scope of action is limited to Europe. In theory, the Communist parties of the nine countries are all equal; however, in reality, the Soviet Union controls the other countries. The two Soviet representatives who attended the Polish meeting were both members of the Politburo, which rules the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The current goal of the new Cominform is to undermine the Marshall Plan, which is also a goal of Soviet policy. But among the Communist parties of the nine countries, only the Communist parties of two countries have the most important tasks in undermining the Marshall Plan, namely the Communist parties of France and Italy.</p>
<p>The next step in the new strategy of the Communist parties and the Soviet Union is to enter France and Italy. In these two countries, the Communist parties do not participate in the government, but they are major parties and control labor organizations.</p>
<p>In France, Communist agitation could seriously undermine the government's efforts to reform the economy and implement the Marshall Plan. They hope for the collapse of the current government, but not necessarily for a major cabinet.</p>
<p>Communists recently tried to prevent French army trucks from transporting sugar to Germany in Verdun. This batch of sugar was sold by the United States to France and was intended for distribution to German civilians in the French occupation zone of Germany, but Communist newspapers argued that the sugar should be distributed to the French, not the Germans.</p>
<p>Such actions may increase in the future and become a major task of the French Communist Party.</p>
<p>In Italy, the Communist Party is currently considering taking strong action because they have failed to seize real power in Italy through elections.</p>
<p>Some Italians may abandon the Communist Party because the latter has openly allied itself with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the latter of which is a country that is competing with Italy for the port of Trieste. However, some Italians, in view of the inevitability of a showdown between the left and right, may abandon moderate political parties and tend towards extremism.</p>
<p>But the following points are worth noting, the success or failure of the new Soviet strategy depends on this: Due to the establishment of the new Cominform, anti-communist sentiment in France and Italy is bound to increase greatly; Strikes and demonstrations will generally become more intense, especially in Italy, which is most prone to radical change due to its weak armed forces; Special attention should be paid to how workers react to Communist leadership. Communist labor leaders have become powerful by claiming to protect the interests of workers. If French and Italian workers suspect that the Communist Party is following Moscow's orders and harming the interests of the workers themselves, the Communist Party's attempts to obstruct the Marshall Plan may collapse.

<p>The previous City Council had proposed that private car owners in the city donate 1 million yuan each to be used for winter relief. After discussion, it was believed that implementation would be difficult, and according to statistics, there are only over 9,000 private cars in the city, most of which belong to government agencies. Therefore, even if the tax is collected according to law, the proceeds would likely be small, and it has now been decided to cancel it. All shelters for the poor must be completed by the 20th of this month. The recipients are divided into two categories: the elderly and the infirm, and the workers in the work relief program, discussing the purchase of building materials.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Public Works Bureau and the Winter Relief Committee are jointly carrying out the winter work relief project to dredge river channels, which is currently underway. The construction sites for the shelters have been surveyed and determined to be in the Wuyi Road area in the western district. Zhao Zukang, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, met with Xu Guang of the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss the purchase of building materials such as bricks, tiles, and wood, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Support for Holding Charity House Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the winter relief house sales method was implemented, it was widely supported by all sectors of society. Yesterday, Wang Xinpu and 13 other employees of the Yuanmao Textile Dyeing Company sent a letter to Mayor Wu in support, hoping to continue issuing the second and third phases, so that new houses can increase, which can prosper Shanghai and reduce black market transfer fees. Mayor Wu has replied, expressing his gratitude for their support of winter relief.</p>
<h3>Gui Zhongshu Invented a Five-Line Chinese Shorthand</h3>
<p>Simple Method, Easy to Learn</p>
<p>[Our Report] The famous lawyer Gui Zhongshu had previously created a "Gui's Word Collection," inventing the positional character search method, positional catalog method, etc., which is another progressive work after Wang Yunwu's Four-Corner Code Word Collection, making a great contribution to the scientific processing of Chinese characters. Recently, he realized that "Chinese shorthand" has not been actively promoted and utilized in our country, and the reason is that Chinese shorthand has not been perfected. After careful research, he invented a "Five-Line Chinese Shorthand," and it is said that he has applied for registration with the Ministry of Interior. He plans to gradually promote it in the future, and it is expected to achieve a landmark success in Chinese shorthand.</p>
<p>This shorthand method requires the use of five shorthand notebooks in the initial practice. The lines are divided into five colors: purple, blue, red, green, and black. The initials of the national phonetic alphabet, which are close to the colors, are marked on the line. For example, "zhi" and "chi" are written on the purple line, and "qi" and "ji" are written on the green line. When writing shorthand, you only need to identify the line or space of the initial, without writing the initial symbol. In addition, the finals in the national phonetic alphabet are divided into 14 single finals and 18 combined finals, each with special symbol regulations. If a word is formed by a final or an initial, the symbol is quickly written in the line or space of the initial in sequence. After the shorthand is completed, the Chinese characters are translated and written on the original five-line staff. Once the practice is proficient or can naturally use the symbols of initials and finals, there is no need to use the five-line staff, so the method is very simple and easy to learn. (Attached is a photo of Gui taking shorthand, taken by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>War Criminal Hoshino Takio Sentenced to Ten Years in Retrial</h3>
<p>Six Other War Criminal Cases Decided at the Same Time</p>
<p>[Our Report] The former commander of the Weihaiwei Gendarmerie detachment, Japanese war criminal Hoshino Takio, was previously sentenced to death by a military court for allegedly killing 18 officers and soldiers of our Muping Security Team. The Ministry of National Defense believed that the evidence was insufficient and sent it back for retrial. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Shi Meiyu announced the verdict, changing the sentence to ten years of imprisonment. In addition, six other war criminal cases were also decided by the military court yesterday: The former Qingdao Gendarmerie Sergeant Mochide Minoru was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing civilians. The former Xiamen Security Team member, Korean Yang Mouzhi, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for robbery. The former Pudong Gendarmerie Captain Kamihoro Nobuya was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for using torture on non-military personnel. The former Xiamen Security Commander Fujiwara Keisuke was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for allowing his subordinates to rob and kill. Sergeant Masamoto Torao and Ikezaki Korenari were acquitted due to insufficient evidence of assaulting women.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Schedules a Research Meeting on Fisheries Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that various fisheries laws and regulations were mostly formulated more than ten years ago, and now there is a need to revise them in response to the needs of the facts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has specially scheduled a meeting of the Fisheries Laws and Regulations Research Committee in Shanghai from the 12th to the 14th to seek advice and strive for perfection.</p>
<h3>Joint Relief Agency Prepares to Protest to the Executive Yuan Over Restrictions on the Quantity of Goods Unloaded by the Fisheries Management Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Joint Relief Agency is preparing to protest to the Executive Yuan because the Shanghai Fisheries Market restricts the quantity of goods unloaded by the Fisheries Management Bureau each month. A spokesman for the Joint Relief Agency claimed yesterday that the agency originally sent ships to catch fresh fish in Shanghai every month to solve the problem of the public's fish food and help suppress prices. Later, at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the number of fish caught and brought to Shanghai was reduced to 60 ships per month. Without prior discussion or explanation, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry ordered the Fisheries Market to limit the Fisheries Management Bureau to unloading 35 ships of fish per month, and now it is limited to 300,000 catties per month. This move undoubtedly raises fish prices and harms people's lives. The Fisheries Management Bureau, seeing that the fresh fish could not be unloaded and was rotting, had no choice but to send telegrams to fishing boats on various seas, ordering them not to return to Shanghai, but to go to ports such as Keelung, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Qingdao, and Tianjin. According to the spokesman, if the Shanghai Fisheries Market only limits the unloading of 300,000 catties per month, it only requires five Joint Relief Agency fishing boats, which can be caught in a week.</p>
<h3>Tao Yishan Appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of the Police Department</h3>
<p>Tao Yishan, the Chief Investigator of the Songlian Garrison Headquarters, has made many practical contributions to the consolidation of Shanghai's public security in recent years, and has been highly praised by the authorities, and has been repeatedly awarded medals such as the Shiding Medal and Commendation Orders. Now that the winter defense period is approaching, Commander Xuan Tiejin has been promoted to strengthen the headquarters personnel and has promoted Tao to Deputy Chief of Staff. Tao has been the Chief Investigator for a long time (Tao served as the Chief Investigator of the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters for three years during the war). He felt that this work was complex and difficult, and he had sleepless nights and exhausted his mental and physical strength. He had repeatedly asked to resign, but was not approved. Previously, he had again requested to resign from the concurrent post of Chief Investigator, and it is said that it has not yet been approved.</p>

<h3>Wage Dispute in the Toothbrush Industry: Labor and Management Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The toothbrush industry previously had a wage dispute, and there was a work slowdown. Now the labor and management have reached an agreement, which was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for record yesterday. It was agreed that: The wage settlement will temporarily be based on the minutes signed on November 18, 1946. The wages for November and December 1947 will be paid in full according to the cost of living index announced on that day. Both labor and management agree that this is a trial, and if the employer really cannot afford it, starting from 1948, the labor side will allow for mutual assistance and understanding. Reconsider the actual situation and renegotiate wage payments.</p>
<h3>A Loud Noise, a False Alarm at the North Railway Station, Passengers Jump Out of Windows, Three Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 9:50 PM the night before last, the 10th train to Nanjing, which was parked at the North Railway Station, suddenly exploded in a section of the No. 893 third-class carriage before departure. With a loud bang, thick smoke spread everywhere, and the smell of gunpowder filled the entire carriage. Passengers, not knowing the truth, jumped out of the windows and fled, causing great chaos. The police and soldiers stationed at the station immediately boarded the train to investigate and found that a travel bag full of firecrackers had exploded. The owner had escaped in the panic, and the false alarm was calmed down. Passengers Fan Ziyan, Xu Zhongyuan, and Wu Xie Shi were injured when they jumped out of the window. Fan injured his head, Xu injured his foot, and Wu injured his face. The North Railway Station authorities sent them to the Railway Hospital. The No. 836 carriage, because it was connected to the No. 893 carriage, had some windows broken during the explosion. Many passengers lost shoes and hats and had their clothes torn. The Railway Bureau will send additional railway police to pay attention to passengers carrying dangerous goods to prevent the same incident from happening.</p>
<h3>Rental Dispute: False Accusations Out of Malice</h3>
<p>Female Teacher Drafts Anonymous Letter, Handwriting Analysis Leads to Father and Daughter Being Investigated</p>
<p>[Our Report] Xianyang Chu was originally the tenant of the house at No. 203 Zha Pu Road. He sublet the remaining rooms to Xu Tianmou, the current manager of the Goods Department of the Chinese Culture Service Agency. Recently, due to the expiration of the lease term, a dispute arose, and a lawsuit has already been filed in court, requesting possession. It is known that Gu, eager to win, consulted his relative Wang Zhaoqi, a specialist in a certain bureau, who lives at No. 6, Lane 206, Chongqing South Road. His daughter, Wang Sumin (19 years old, a graduate of a university and a teacher at Xishi Middle School), drafted two anonymous letters and sent them directly to the Garrison Headquarters, alleging that the Xu family was a secret drug manufacturing organization. After receiving the letter, the Garrison Headquarters transferred it to the Police Bureau's Detective Section, which ordered officers to investigate for several days, but there was no concrete evidence. Xu was summoned to the bureau for questioning, who claimed that he was being falsely accused, and the motive may have been due to the housing dispute. In order to clarify the situation, the police bureau ordered the original manuscript of the lawsuit filed by Gu to be inspected and compared with the handwriting, confirming that it was written by the same person. At this point, Gu Yangchu and Wang Zhaoqi and his daughter Wang Sumin were summoned for questioning. However, Gu and Wang denied it, but the bureau, with conclusive evidence of anonymous false accusations, has transferred the case to the District Procuratorate according to law. It is reported that Wang Zhaoqi and his daughter have been temporarily allowed to be released on bail pending investigation.</p>
<h3>False Theft Report Backfires</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Songshan Police Sub-Bureau received a report from Yao Zhangshi, a resident of No. 126 Ninghai West Road, at 8:30 PM last night, stating that a robbery had occurred in his home. They immediately dispatched a large number of police officers and red police cars to patrol and arrest. As a result, Yang Weibing, Zhu Zhen, Xu Jianming, Yang Senlin, and others were arrested at the scene. However, after interrogation, it was learned that it was due to a housing dispute. The police officers took Yao Zhangshi to the bureau for questioning for falsely reporting a theft.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Sends Personnel to Station at the Factory to Dispatch Electricity in the Nanshi Area: China Electric Company Urges the Shipment of Generators</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the electricity supply problem in the Nanshi area, the generators of Shanghai Electric Power Company and Zhabei Water and Electricity Company have successively failed, resulting in a sharp reduction in the power supply of China Electric Company. Now the boilers of the two companies have been repaired last week, and the electricity supply situation in the Nanshi area should improve. The Public Utilities Bureau will send Liu Kechang of the bureau to be stationed at the China Electric Company's power plant every night starting today to be responsible for dispatching electricity matters. In order to solve the electricity shortage in the Nanshi area, China Electric Company previously purchased two generators from Xingzong, totaling 4,000 kilowatts, which have not yet been shipped. The Public Utilities Bureau has sent a letter to Xingzong urging the prompt delivery. In addition, the company has two generators with a total of about 17,000 to 8,000 kilowatts, which are currently stored at Shijingshan, Beijing.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Students in Japan Live in Hardship, Number of Returnees to Increase, Returnees Talk About Recent Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>A group of 15 overseas Chinese students who returned to Shanghai from Japan a few days ago were provided with food and lodging by the authorities and were accommodated together with returnees from South Sakhalin Island. According to Yu Zhiqiang and Wang Ricai, graduates of the Imperial University, the recent situation in Japan is as follows: After the war, Japan continued to implement food rationing, but each person only received 2.5 go per day, which was not enough, so the black market was rampant, life was insecure, and theft increased. The general middle and lower classes of Japanese people still despise China. The more knowledgeable intellectuals express their goodwill and concern for the internal situation in China. Although many Japanese people still miss their past empire, most Japanese people are most concerned about obtaining improved and stable living conditions. The awakened Japanese people have called for building a "Sweden of the East," meaning that Japan should devote all its efforts to the development of culture and science and no longer dream of military expansion. The Japanese people's idol worship of the Emperor has changed slightly. They now regard Hirohito as a "human emperor," and only a few communists advocate overthrowing him. Japan's industry has not developed rapidly. According to a professor at a Japanese university in a lecture, Japan will not devote itself to the reconstruction of industry before the compensation issue is resolved, fearing that all construction will be used to offset compensation, so Japanese industrialists prefer to preserve equipment and raw materials without using them. Regarding the situation of overseas Chinese, it is said that those who used to open restaurants have now mostly changed to "coffee shops," but their livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult, and the number of returnees will increase. In addition, there are more than 200 students studying in Japan, working part-time and studying, and their lives are also very difficult. They hope that the government will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Returning from Jiujiang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Short Stay in Fuzhou · Ending a Five-Thousand-Li Journey</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, 5th] From Nanchang to Jiujiang, there is the Nanxun Railway, which is now under the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administration and is the Nanxun Line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. We went to Jiujiang on December 3rd, taking the train. I imagined that the land along the route should be better than in eastern Jiangxi, but as soon as we left Nanchang, it was desolate and bleak. The train ran very smoothly, passing through some stations. After traveling for about three hours, Mount Lu came into view, and on the banks of Poyang Lake, there was still a patch of withered reeds. Before we knew it, we had arrived in Jiujiang.</p>
<p>Eight or Nine Tenths Harvest in a Bountiful Year</p>
<p>I, the reporter, had been to Jiujiang in September of the year of victory. At that time, it was unusually desolate. Today, revisiting the old place, I felt it was very lively. Crowds of people were coming and going in the streets. Not long ago, the Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense was located here, which made Jiujiang important and also made it active.</p>
<p>According to the old people of Jiujiang, this year's harvest is eight or nine tenths, which is considered a bountiful year. The population here is 140,000, and there are seven middle schools, including the Girls' Normal School. It is said that before the war, it was much more lively and the population was also larger. Now, because there are wars in Guangji, Huangmei, and other counties, many merchants and goods cannot be shipped out.</p>
<p>Jingdezhen Porcelain Business Not Very Prosperous</p>
<p>There are more porcelain shops in Jiujiang than in Nanchang, probably about a hundred. You can't walk five steps without encountering a porcelain shop, and the variety of goods in the shops is much greater than in Nanchang. Here, you can directly access Jingdezhen, the origin of porcelain. Porcelain made in Jingdezhen can be transported to Poyang Lake, and then transferred from Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River, where it is unloaded on the shore in Jiujiang. People who sell porcelain in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou also come to Jiujiang to purchase goods along the river. Porcelain merchants told me: This year's business is not very prosperous. The money from selling goods cannot cover the cost of replenishing them, and transportation is blocked in many places due to the flames of war, which is severely impacting business.</p>
<p>Xu Zuyi Reports that Jiangfang Can Be Carefree</p>
<p>Recently, the price of rice in Jiujiang has risen sharply, from 400,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan per dan in a matter of days. An officer from the command told me: "The military eats military rice, so the price of rice should not rise. Not only has the price of rice risen, but the prices of everything have risen accordingly." In order to show our concern for military affairs, we once visited Minister Bai Chongxi. Minister Bai was out on official business, and Chief of Staff Xu Zuyi hosted us at a tea party. Through this reception, we obtained a lot of war news. We also learned that the National Army defends the north bank of the Yangtze River, the security team defends the south bank, and the navy defends the river, so we can say that the river defense is safe.</p>
<p>Small Tour of Gan Tang Lake, Returning to Nanchang City</p>
<p>Jiujiang has a Gan Tang Lake, in which there is the Yanshui Pavilion, which is said to be the place where Zhou Yu of the Three Kingdoms trained naval soldiers. We looked out at the lake from afar and saw fishing boats, casting their nets and cruising on Gan Tang Lake, creating a peaceful picture.</p>
<p>We returned to Nanchang by railway, taking a railcar from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau. This type of car simply replaces the tires with railway wheels and can run very fast, traveling at 60 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>Fuzhou, Visiting Farmhouses, Taro and Wheat Too Dry</p>
<p>Then, we returned from Nanchang to Shanghai, taking a passenger plane from the Central Aviation Corporation. We made a short stop in Fuzhou, where we inquired with local farmers and learned that there were droughts in several places in March and floods in several places in June. Now, it has been dry for months, and the winter wheat crop has been severely affected. The local unit of measurement for rice is 160 jin per shi, and the price is 1 million yuan per shi. Vegetable oil costs 33,600 yuan per jin. The price of goods is not low. Fuzhou produces oranges, especially in Yiyu Township, which is the most abundant. Lacquerware and tea are also very famous. Fuzhou City has a population of 400,000.</p>
<p>Taking off from Fuzhou again, we crossed high mountains and ridges, passed Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang, and Songjiang in Jiangsu, before arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Immigration to Reclaim Jiangxi Province, Prosperity Can Be Expected</p>
<p>On this journey of nearly ten days, we passed through the four provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Jiangsu, traveling approximately 5,000 li. Comparing these four provinces, Jiangxi Province is the poorest. Due to its vast land and sparse population, desolation is everywhere, which has turned China's famous and abundant granary into a poor and unbearable place. What can be said here is that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is actively under construction, will soon be fully opened to traffic. We eagerly hope that relying on it, the densely populated provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang can immigrate and reclaim the land in Jiangxi Province, so that the products and culture of Jiangxi can interact with the products and culture of Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, and at the same time, the entire Southeast and Southwest can cooperate closely and prosper.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Cracks Down on Gambling Den, 52 Gamblers Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 7th] The Suzhou County Police Bureau, believing that gambling is rampant in the countryside and petty criminals are mixed in, which not only threatens public safety but also leads to farmers losing their family fortunes every day, the consequences of which are unimaginable, secretly dispatched all police officers to various districts to investigate, hoping to eradicate it in one fell swoop. On the morning of the 6th, the police bureau received a report that a large gambling den was set up at the end of Shantang Street in Mudu Town, with gamblers as numerous as clouds and huge stakes. Therefore, they secretly dispatched the patrol chief Wu Yongfu, leading the police to rush to the scene to cooperate with the police sub-bureau in charge to encircle and arrest them. In one fell swoop, they captured 52 gamblers, loaded them onto a long-distance bus from the Su Fu Bus Company, and escorted them to the city for transfer to the local procuratorate for legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhu Tongsu Accused of Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 7th] The case of Zhu Tongsu, the former chief judge of the Jingjiang County Judiciary, who was accused of corruption for soliciting bribes and privately releasing a murderer, has been concluded by the Criminal Division of the District Court and will be sentenced on the 11th. The court ordered him to pay a written bail of 15 million yuan pending judgment, but he was detained for lack of bail.</p>
<p>The Northeast in Heavy Snow</p>
<p>The heavy snow has brought freezing suffering to the people of the Northeast, but it has also brought magnificent scenery to the people of the Northeast. There is pain and enjoyment. Four or five months have passed in hatred and love. These few photos show the beautiful side: Beautiful streets, in front of the National Army Martyrs' Shrine (photographed by special correspondent Han Qingtao)</p>
<h3>Plague Rampant in Shangrao, 58 Cases, 45 Deaths</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 7th] Since the discovery of the plague in Shangrao, it has become increasingly rampant and may spread to Shanghai and Hangzhou. Up to now, there are 58 plague patients in the area, and 45 have died. The high mortality rate is shocking. After the staff of the Central Medical Prevention Team disinfected every household in the vicinity of the station, the epidemic has slightly subsided. However, dead rats are still often found in hotels and restaurants. The medical prevention team also suggested that trains passing through Shangrao and Shaxi should temporarily stop and that the Ministry of Transportation should allocate more covered wagons to apply potassium cyanide to fumigate the accumulated cotton, grain, and other goods stored in Shangrao before transporting them out.</p>
<h3>Canal Rural Teachers, Teachers and Students Abducted and Released, Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th] The Provincial Canal Rural Normal School, with branches located at Canal Station in Xudong and Huangkou in Xuxi, was recently surrounded and attacked by a large group of communist bandits at the Huangkou campus. All the teachers and students were abducted. Although they have now been released, all the school's property and equipment, as well as the teachers' and students' clothing and luggage, were looted and destroyed. Even the clothes they were wearing were taken away. Currently, all the faculty and students are gathered in Xuzhou, in a very miserable state, suffering from hunger and cold, and urgently need relief. The school principal, Wang Zishi, went from Xu to Zhen on the 6th to report the incident to the provincial authorities and asked the council to provide effective relief. The Jiangsu Education Department has ordered the school staff remaining in Xu to merge and concentrate at the Canal Station main campus to resume classes as soon as possible, while the province is trying to provide emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Xu Gui's Estate Ruled Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 6th] The Suzhou High Procuratorate previously requested the Criminal Court to declare the separate confiscation of the property of Xu Gui, the former head of the Pseudo-Jiangsu Provincial Government, after he was sentenced to imprisonment by the Criminal Court and died in prison due to thinness. It is now known that this request has been approved by the Criminal Court.</p>
<h3>Underground Gold Stirs, White Coins Reign in Longshang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 3rd (Air Mail)] There is no stock exchange in the Northwest. The manipulator behind the prices of goods is gold. On the surface, the gold shops in Lanzhou have stopped trading in accordance with the law, with their doors half-closed, but in reality, underground transactions are extremely frequent. A week ago, a "烚赤" (likely a local term for gold) soared from 5.9 million to 9 million, almost reaching the 10 million mark. Fortunately, the National Bank, on instructions, stopped all lending operations, and within two or three days, the black market price of gold fell back to 6 million. Other department stores were also affected, and prices gradually fell by 20-30%. Today, it is rumored in the market that the government has for the first time cracked down on a gold black market trader, seized 100 taels of gold on the spot, and handed him over to the Gaolan Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Although gold is valuable, it cannot compete with white coins in various counties of eastern and southern Gansu. When I, the reporter, saw the use of hard currency in the Qinghai Tibetan areas a few months ago, I explained the phenomenon as a special border situation, but according to people who recently came to Lanzhou from southern Gansu, almost all counties in eastern and southern Gansu use white coins. In eastern and southern Gansu, white coins are rampant, prices are rising desperately, the market is chaotic, rumors are spreading like bees, and people are panicking. In order to stabilize prices and calm people's minds, in addition to cutting off the root of the problem and strictly controlling speculators, we should first start with "white coins"!

<h3>The Automotive Engineering Basketball Team Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday, The Schedule is Set for a Total of Five Games, Renyu Will Be the First to Play Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>The basketball team of the 16th Automotive Engineering Regiment of Chongqing, having fought in Central China and the capital city, is invincible and has a brilliant record. The entire team, led by Wang Shixuan, left Bai Xia by express train from Nanjing yesterday morning and arrived at the North Station at 4:30 PM. Qian Xucang, chairman of the Municipal Basketball Committee, Xie Yiqin, Shi Yin, Qu Xirong, and others welcomed them at the station. The team members were all dressed in grass-green cotton military uniforms. After getting off the train, they drove to the Weida Hotel to rest. Yu Ruizhang and Liu Zhengjun, who are also members of the 16th Regiment, also decided to serve their alma mater this time, and arrived in Shanghai this morning. After the visiting team arrived in Shanghai, they discussed the competition matters with the Basketball Committee that evening. According to Wang Shixuan, the leader of the team, the purpose of the 16th Automotive Engineering Regiment's visit to Shanghai is to enable the players to exchange skills and gain experience. It is hoped that they can compete with various strong Chinese teams in Shanghai to learn from each other. However, the venue of the Municipal Gymnasium is difficult to allocate enough time due to the upcoming Basketball League and Badminton Tournament. In order to respect the opinions of the visiting team, the Basketball Committee agreed with the visiting team that they would first compete with Chinese teams for five games from tomorrow until the 17th. If time permits, they will also compete with teams from the Western Overseas Team, such as the Encas or the US Air Force and US Military Police.

<h3>Nankai Defeats Chongqing University in Yu Police Cup Football Match, Determined by Penalty Kicks</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 7th] The Chongqing University-Nankai Yu Police Cup football match, which ended in a tie last week, was held at the Chongqing University field at 3:00 PM today. Less than twenty minutes into the game, a Chongqing University left-back committed a foul, resulting in a penalty. Nankai's Qin Guangtong took the penalty kick, scoring directly, ending the first half with a score of 1-0. After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. Chongqing University intensified its offensive, but ultimately failed due to poor coordination. Yang Weiyang of Nankai was the most active player throughout the game, showing great potential.

<h3>The Origins of British Football (Part 2)</h3>
<p>By Le Xiurong</p>
<p>This cup competition later became the standard for various cup competitions in England and is the most famous football cup competition in the world.</p>
<p>The FA Cup competition began in 1871. The first competition had 15 participating teams, with three teams dropping out. In the final, the Royal Watterloo team defeated the Royal Engineers team 1-0 at Kennington. Initially, only people related to the two teams attended the matches. Gradually, it has become the most watched football final in England.</p>
<p>In 1878, the Watterloo team voluntarily handed over the silver cup to the FA according to the regulations at the time. Unexpectedly, in 1895, Aston Villa won the cup, and the silver cup was stolen during an exhibition in Birmingham. In 1911, a second cup was made and presented to Kinnaird, the then president of the Football Association, to thank him for his contributions to football. At the same time, the Football Association decided to make an even more magnificent silver cup. This is the third silver cup for which 500 teams compete each year.</p>
<p>Before 1892, the finals were held at Kennington Oval. From then until 1914, they were held at Crystal Palace. After the First World War, they were moved to Stamford Bridge's Gilslade Ground, and since 1923, they have been held at Wembley Stadium. (The World Games next year will also be held here).</p>
<p>From 1893, the Football Association also organized an amateur cup competition, with about 400 teams participating each year. Both the FA Cup and the Amateur Cup are completely under the management of the Football Association.</p>
<p>According to the competition rules, there is no regulation for teams to distribute tickets. However, in 1887, it was stipulated that the ticket revenue before the quarter-finals should be distributed equally among the competing teams. In 1889, it was further stipulated that the teams participating in the quarter-finals could receive 50% of the tickets. But today, the Football Association gets one-third of the final tickets, one-fifth of the quarter-final tickets, and a very small portion of the tickets before the quarter-finals. Since last year, the ticket allocation for each club has been increased again. (End)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Flexible Measures for Transactions between Provincial/Municipal Banks and Commercial Firms: Restricting Lending Amounts and Requiring Next-Day Repayment</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the third provision of the measures for strengthening the control of financial operations in the economic emergency plan, excess funds of provincial and municipal banks should be deposited in local branches of the Central Bank or national banks. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance, based on the submissions from various provincial and municipal banks, provincial and municipal governments, and banking associations, stated that provincial and municipal local banks have the responsibility of regulating local finance, and it is inappropriate to sever ties with commercial firms. Moreover, interbank lending with commercial firms is based on mutual assistance and is very short-term, which does not seem to promote speculation, and does not conflict with the provisions of the economic emergency measures. It is requested that a flexible approach be taken, etc., which is considered essential. In order to stabilize finance and adapt to the needs of reality, six provisions are specifically stipulated:</p>
<p>If local credit is tight and commercial firms in various provinces and cities (municipalities directly under the central government) experience financial difficulties, provincial and municipal banks may, under the principle of not hindering their own operations, approve short-term lending upon request from commercial firms with good local credit and normal operations.</p>
<p>The total amount of such lending shall not exceed two-tenths of the bank's total deposit balance on the previous day.</p>
<p>The maximum amount of lending to each commercial firm shall not exceed one-tenth of the lending bank's daily lending limit.</p>
<p>The lending period shall be based on the principle of repayment on the following day, but if there are reasons such as inconvenient transportation or tight money market conditions, the term may be extended once, limited to one day, and shall not exceed five days at most.</p>
<p>The lending areas or approved lending institutions of provincial and municipal banks shall be stipulated in advance by each bank and reported to the Ministry for approval. Lending shall not be undertaken in areas or by institutions that have not been approved.</p>
<p>Each lending bank shall prepare and submit a monthly report on lending.</p>
<h3>Textile Export Commission States: Yarn and Cloth Exports Most Promising; Supplementing Raw Cotton and Enriching Domestic Sales Can Both Be Addressed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Export Commission recently expressed the following views to reporters regarding the need for yarn and cloth exports:</p>
<p>1.  The insufficient supply of raw cotton domestically is a severe fact currently facing the textile industry. It is estimated that this year, the amount of domestically produced cotton that can be purchased and supplied to the textile industry will only reach 4 million dan. However, the national number of spindles already in operation requires 8 million dan of raw cotton. Therefore, in addition to domestic cotton, there is a shortage of 4 million dan, equivalent to 1.1 million bales in Indian packaging, which must be supplemented by imported cotton. The foreign exchange payment for this amount of foreign cotton, calculated at the current US dollar value, is US$158.4 million. Calculated at the current Indian cotton value, it is 520 million rupees. Even if this amount of foreign exchange cannot be fully offset by yarn and cloth exports, at least a portion of it should be offset. Otherwise, even if one wants to import, it will inevitably be impossible. If raw cotton cannot be supplemented in full quantity, production will naturally decrease proportionally. In addition to greatly affecting daily necessities for the people, serious problems such as factory shutdowns and unemployment will arise.</p>
<p>As for the method of exchanging Indian cotton, it also has its advantages. It can not only import raw materials and increase production, but also enrich a portion of domestic sales. In reality, after the cotton is exchanged, the export of finished products is only an export of a portion of wages. Moreover, according to the current contract, the first batch involves shipping the cotton to Shanghai first, and then shipping the yarn and cloth from Shanghai. It also stipulates that one-tenth of the yarn and cloth produced in six months can be exchanged for cotton at a time. This is calculated from the date of the contract, so it will not affect current domestic sales.</p>
<p>2.  Among China's export commodities, tea has Indian tin as a strong competitor, and raw silk has Japan. Currently, the United States has greatly increased the production of soybeans in recent years, which will also encounter attacks. In the future, the most promising exports are textiles. The number of yarn and cloth sold in the South Sea Islands is quite large. Before the war, it was occupied by Japan. After the victory, Japan withdrew, and there is an extreme shortage of yarn and cloth. China should have risen up to replace it. If China's textiles do not strive for this market at this time (the Near East and Africa should also strive for it at the same time), future exports, or even the entire textile industry, will have no way to develop.</p>
<p>In short, given the current situation of considerable strain on national foreign exchange, insufficient domestic cotton production, the supply of existing spindles, and the international yarn and cloth market being in urgent need of seizure, importing cotton and spinning it into yarn and cloth, taking only seven-tenths for export to offset the foreign exchange paid, and the factory also gaining considerable profit, is a business that should be actively promoted and well prepared for. The only concern is that the export quantity will be affected by competition and will not be able to reach the predetermined ear within a certain period.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association Requests Issuance of Large Denomination Notes: Petition Submitted to National Bank</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] An official of the National Bank told reporters yesterday that the petition submitted by the Shanghai Bankers Association and the Money Exchange Association requesting the issuance of large-denomination banknotes to solve the problem of cash collection has been submitted to the National Bank. He said that the National Bank has no opinion on this matter and will submit it to the government for a final decision.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>The government bond market was very sluggish yesterday, with a turnover of just over 3 million. The rise and fall of various bonds were minimal. Unified C opened at 24,700 yuan in the morning, with the lowest price at just 24,100 yuan, but stabilized towards closing. Room 552 bought, while Rooms 503, 360, and 555 all offered supply. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B fell by 100 yuan, C fell by 300 yuan, Unified D rose by 100 yuan, and Unified E remained flat.</p>
<p>There were no special changes in foreign stocks either. Although Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric had a slight contraction, the stimulation was not significant. The rise and fall of Ewo Silk were very narrow, opening at 356,000 yuan and falling to a low of 351,000 yuan, before rebounding. Guangbang hongs sold, while bank hongs and retail investors bought slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, electric, military, and telephone remained flat, Landgrafen fell by 10%, shipping fell by half a percent, paper rose slightly, and the rest all fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Money Market Remains Tight</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The money market remained tight yesterday, with secret interest rates at 1.2%. The Huagu deposit rate was 2.55%. The four banks and two bureaus had a shortfall of 96.2 billion, with the Central Bank taking in 53.5 billion. The large exchange released 35.9 billion, foreign merchants took in 54.1 billion, the small exchange released 14.4 billion, China Joint Venture took in 13.7 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury took in 15 billion.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Industry Supports Small and Medium Enterprises: Launching Small-Amount Loans</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Shanghai's money exchange industry leaders, such as Shen Rixin, believe that one of the original purposes of the industry is to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and to facilitate the turnover of small-amount funds. Therefore, they have decided to launch a money exchange loan syndicate, set up a management committee, and conduct two types of loans: small business loans and small-amount loans. The former targets small and medium-sized enterprises, while the latter targets public and educational staff. It is reported that the pre-determined loan amount will be a maximum of 5 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 5%. Fifteen people have been nominated and a subcommittee meeting will be convened today to draft organizational and lending plans, which will be submitted to the board of directors of the Money Exchange Association for approval.</p>
<p>P&gt; Buyers Wait and See, Buying on Dips: Yarn, Cotton and Cloth Market Stable</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened steadily yesterday. The situation in the market was that due to the tight money market, new purchases were rarely active. People in the industry, suffering from tight capital, often sold at a painful loss, causing 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn to fall to 47.5 million yuan at one point. Later, because various hongs saw the price and absorbed it slightly, the closing price recovered to 48 million yuan, which was 200,000 yuan lower than Saturday. In addition to 32-count and Special Double Majincheng yarn, which rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan, other 16-count yarns generally fell by 200,000 to 400,000 yuan or 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>At the initial opening, because the supply of weaving and construction from Saturday was very sufficient, the price once fell. However, due to favorable buying news and the favor of customer hongs, as well as actions taken on the street and retail replenishment, the market recovered at noon. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloths of various grades rose by 5,000 to 12,000 yuan, and bleached cloth also rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Huagu market saw volatile fluctuations because various news were still difficult to clarify and people's minds were uncertain. The rise and fall of various stocks were slight. Hwa Foong Enamel tokens were not selling well, and there were favorable buying rumors, so both spot and forward contracts had risen to the limit. The trends of other cloths seemed to show a situation of being outwardly stable but inwardly firm.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was mediocre. Yarn mills took delivery slightly, and transactions were quiet. There was little activity among peers, the market was quiet, and prices did not change much. 355 bales were traded, with the delivery price to factories being 4.96 million yuan for Shashi, 5.084 million yuan for Zhancheng, 5.167 million yuan for Jingyang, 4.3 million yuan for Han fine, and 925,000 yuan for Zhoupu cottonseed.</p>
<p>Weaving and Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Weaving and Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,283 pieces, equivalent to 2,500.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 547 applications were received.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Rise and Fall Slightly, with Volatile and Unstable Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Huagu saw volatile fluctuations because various news were still difficult to clarify and people's minds were uncertain. The rise and fall of various stocks were slight. Hwa Foong Enamel tokens were not selling well, and there were favorable buying rumors, so both spot and forward contracts had risen to the limit.</p>
<p>Morning opening saw low prices due to the large banknotes not being implemented and US loan news. When the market opened, Yong Silk retreated to 370 yuan and 380 yuan, and then further retreated to 360 yuan and 373 yuan. Some people took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the price recovered to 374 yuan for immediate delivery and 382 yuan for forward delivery. At this time, sellers started to sell, and the off-market interest rate opened high at 21% and 25.5%, and gradually fell to a low price of 361 yuan for immediate delivery and 368 yuan for forward delivery. The off-market situation was still good, and it rose slightly to 365 yuan and 372 yuan near noon. The noon closing price still retreated to 362 yuan and 370 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday's immediate delivery shares, China Silk fell slightly by 10%, China-France Underwear fell by half a percent, Yong Silk, Zhabei, Xinyihe, Mayar, Xinju, Jingfu, Qinxing, Lilian, Yonggong, Guohuo, Datong, Tongyi, and Rongfeng all fell slightly, China New Firecrackers, China Xing, New Asia, and Xinhua were flat, while Hwa Foong and China Textile rose slightly. For forward delivery shares, Hwa Foong was still flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>The market sentiment was slightly better later in the day. It was reported that Hong Kong Electric had contracted, and Hwa Foong Enamel suddenly had news of establishing a branch factory in Kowloon. The buying trend started, and the number of tokens was limited, so both spot and forward contracts had stopped rising. Small stocks such as Mayar, China Silk, and New Light also showed a good color. Later, because the small exchange reported a shortfall of more than 100 billion at the time of exchange, and the National Bank must make up the difference, the market situation was again unsustainable. It gradually returned to a low price of 362 yuan and 366 yuan. Numbers 157 and 91 forcefully advanced and were then lifted up again, and the closing price rose again to 372 yuan and 376 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning closing price, the spot shares of Hwa Foong had risen sharply and closed at the limit. Yong Silk, Xinyihe, Mayar, New Light, Jingfu, Qinxing, China-France, Xinhua, Zhabei Underwear, China-France, Yonggong, Lilian, Guohuo, China Silk, Rongfeng, and Tongyi rose slightly, China Xing fell slightly, New Asia fell by half a percent, Jinglun was good for 10%, and firecrackers and Hwa Shin were flat. As for the forward shares, Hwa Foong rose sharply and closed at the limit, and the rest all increased slightly. Various foreign stocks in the off-market market fell slightly.</p>

It is reported that a draft can be completed within about a week and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The committee is expected to be formally established within this year, so that it can implement control matters starting next year.</p>
<p>The authorities have decided that the list of members of the committee will not include members of private factories. Private factories still maintain a silent attitude on this matter. However, Chen Shutong, Yun Zhang, and Wu Weijing discussed the matter and planned to invite Chen and Li to participate in the committee, and invite Wu to assist in the committee's business affairs. However, they said that after the new committee is established, the position of state-owned and private spinning mills will be no different, and they believe it is difficult to participate. Related parties also stated that if the new committee wants to promote the control work as much as possible, the selection of committee members should include two transcendent figures within the textile industry to participate and discuss, in order to communicate various difficulties between the control authorities and the spinning mills, so that any method can be implemented smoothly and eliminate mutual isolation.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 17,200 stones of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets, and sales improved, rebounding after fatigue. White Japonica rice rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while thin Indica rice increased sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. White Yin Yuan rice digested actively, rising sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Indica rice also increased by more than 10,000 yuan, with ups and downs, and the situation tended towards a revolving pattern. Flour opened evenly, and rose rapidly near noon, rising by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Wheat bran was in short supply and high demand, soaring by more than 10,000 yuan, and the situation gradually increased. Soybean cake from Taiwan and Shantou continued to be ordered, and remained strong. Customer hongs selectively increased the high price of soybeans slightly, while oil mills were still slack, setting the price first and then becoming tired. Duzhong from Nanyang was favored and rose slightly by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung beans had few spirits in the light trading, and it was not easy to move forward. Red beans were still rarely traded and were still in a dull and tired state. Broad beans were depressed, and red grain from the north was accompanied by business, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Corn from the north turned light after seeing the departure, and the source increased, falling back by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to be received by Guangbang hongs, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame saw customer hongs killing short and taking slightly, and the price on the street was also tight, but oil mills were cold, and the price fell slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and black sesame also fell by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to Nanyang's purchases, the oil market saw unrefined oil soar early in the morning, but it was slightly weaker at noon. As a result, the price increased by 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories still supplied a lot, and followed the increase by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan successively, and clear oil was also high by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks is Ripe</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The reorganization of the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks has now reached a mature stage. After the reorganization, the committee of the Shanghai Branch will include nine units including the Ministry of Finance and national banks, with each unit sending two representatives to participate. After the reorganization, the branch will divide the work into five groups. It is rumored that Liu Gongyun has been internally appointed as the chairman, and other personnel and organizational matters are still to be decided at the headquarters' regular meeting this Thursday.</p>
<h3>Xu Boyuan Gives Speech on "Controlling Finance"</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Deputy Finance Minister Xu Boyuan gave a speech at the Shanghai Financial Issues Research Association yesterday, entitled "Controlling Finance". Xu said that according to the Ministry of Finance's data at the end of September, the total number of various banking institutions across the country, including national banks, provincial and municipal banks, county banks, commercial banks, money changers, silver shops, trust companies, and insurance companies, totaled 5,666 units. Among them, the head offices accounted for 1,941 units, and the branch offices accounted for 3,725 units. The number is second only to the United States and is unparalleled in any other country. The government paid special attention to three principles in the establishment and distribution of financial institutions during the war: encouraging the financial industry to set up institutions in the interior to make financial turnover in the interior more flexible, restricting the excessive concentration of financial institutions in large coastal and riverside cities to prevent hot money from wreaking havoc, and cracking down on underground money changers to protect the safety of social credit. The current stage of financial control aims to eliminate the black market for gold and banknotes and cracking down on commodity hoarding in a negative way, and to guide financial business to cooperate with economic construction, restore the original credibility of the financial sector, and stabilize the hearts of the people in a positive way.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market was still firm and expensive yesterday, especially for fancy tweeds, which were particularly scarce. Fancy tweeds with mixed colors were more popular than plain tweeds, and most factory stores were not willing to sell them easily. Mixed-color fabrics produced by Yuanfeng, Zhanghua, and Shanghai Xiexin were all sold for 1.3 million to 1.6 million yuan per yard, while single-color tweeds from Dacheng, Daye, Dahua, Daming, Yonghe, and Ruihua were all sold for around 1 million yuan per yard. Black and gray were still the most popular for overcoat fabrics. Because Milleden had risen too sharply, it created a good opportunity for China Textile, and retail sales were still strong. Trading was inferior to last week due to the relationship between money and short-term interest rates.</p>

<h3>Random Talks on Learning (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Constructive Democracy</p>
<p>More than two years have passed since the end of the war. The cheers of victory have long faded. The world is still like a freezer in the depths of winter, and no one knows when spring will come to the human world. During the war, Allied people believed that they could promote understanding through mutual assistance and goodwill, but the result was that conflicts piled up. The ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union have deepened more than before. The interpretations of the word "democracy" by the United States and the Soviet Union are vastly different, as if they were separated by a chasm. The problem of thought is indeed the fundamental problem of the current myriad difficulties.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's view of democracy leans towards collectivism. The government exists for the benefit of the masses or the proletariat. If the interests of the majority can indeed be taken care of, then who is in power and the method of exercising power are secondary issues. In the view of the Soviet leadership, anyone who can serve the people and sacrifice for the people, regardless of their style, is a democrat. This kind of interpretation seems to imply that the end justifies the means, which is obviously not satisfactory to the British and Americans. The British and Americans' view of democracy leans towards individualism, believing that the individual is the basic unit of the country, and every citizen should have ample opportunity for development, because without that, it cannot be called democracy.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for these two incompatible concepts. Religion, politics, society, economy, history, and geography all have their roots. Therefore, it is necessary to study from many aspects to be able to see the inside and out. In the current turbulent world, due to the Soviet Union's strong barriers and fierce challenges, insightful people in Britain and the United States believe that it is necessary to re-evaluate their traditional culture. Many new books published in recent years express this new idea, such as Professor George Norlo's "The Quest of American Life" (published by the University of Colorado in 1945), which is a good example.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Americans crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the New World, and even issued the Declaration of Independence. Their motivation was to resist tyranny and oppose government control. Professor Norlo called Americans "a protesting nation" (A protestiag people), and its foundation lies in individualistic political freedom. Norlo called this spirit humanism. He does not use liberalism or democracy (democracy) because these two terms have been used too much and are easily misunderstood. Norlo's meaning is that the United States has certainly not yet reached the ideal realm of humanism. But in the history of the development of the American nation, every time it reaches a new period, it can often launch a powerful protest against domestic and foreign absurd actions. Since the nineteenth century, the United States has eliminated corruption and reformed internal affairs, which is another manifestation of the spirit of nation-building. More than ten years ago, President Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, represented by the T.V.A. system (my book "Travel Notes in the United States" has introduced it, pages 52 to 58 of the Commercial Press edition), which increased government power and implemented a planned economy. It was indeed an innovation movement, but was it not also a traditional spirit? The characteristic of the New Deal lies in its emphasis on greater social justice. In fact, the United States has been demanding social justice since its founding. President Roosevelt transformed American democracy from the old to the new, which is precisely to promote the inherent spirit of the United States. The program of humanism respects individual rights on the one hand and raises living standards on the other, taking the advantages of communism and discarding its shortcomings. Modern world thought is not as insurmountable as a chasm, but like layers upon layers upward. We need not worry about ideological problems. If we strive upwards with small breaks, the future will definitely be infinitely bright. Accordingly, the Y.V.A. plan, which is currently attracting national attention, relies on American science and technology, which is secondary. The most important thing is to engage in democracy experiments in a down-to-earth manner in the process of construction.</p>
<p>Human Ecology</p>
<p>The 79-year-old British literary giant H. G. Wells (1866-1946) has passed away. He was the greatest science educator of this century, integrating science and humanities. He has a deep foundation in physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, biology, etc., and a wide range of new knowledge. Relying on his extraordinary literary talent, he used writing to convey the Tao, integrating scientific principles and writing nearly one hundred works; including history, novels, and treatises on social and political issues. Among them, works such as "Outline of History" and "The Science of Life" (co-authored with his eldest son and Juliaa Huxley) have been translated into Chinese and have long been admired by the Chinese people. His work starts from the happiness of the entire human race, exploring the intricate meanings of the latest discoveries and inventions in various specialized sciences, and carefully elucidating their common principles, and explaining how human beings can innovate and seek more happiness in the many new issues that arise in this new era. This kind of intellectual effort, harp, is called human environmental science or simply human ecology by Sir Ric Gregory. (See British Natural Weekly Nature, September 21, 1946) Pioneering the study of human ecology is Wells's greatest contribution in his life. Originally, science only sought the cause and did not ask about the purpose. The purpose of human ecology is to understand the relationship between heaven and man, understand the changes of the past and the present, and enable scientific progress to have a moral impact. With the guidance of this torch, the human world can still hold new hope. Wells is a representative figure of modern neo-humanism.</p>
<h3>"Sincerity" and the Work of Learning and Deliberation</h3>
<p>— Yan Qun</p>
<p>The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Sincerity is the way of Heaven; to make oneself sincere is the way of man. He who is sincere hits upon what is right without effort; he apprehends without thinking; he easily and naturally embodies the Tao—he is a sage. He who seeks sincerity chooses what is good and firmly holds it fast." (Chapter 20 of Zhu Xi's Annotations) It also says: "Next to him who is thus naturally sincere is he who attains to sincerity by cultivating himself. He who cultivates sincerity hits the mark. Hitting the mark manifests itself; manifesting itself makes him distinguished; being distinguished, he is able to influence; being able to influence, he is able to transform; being able to transform, he is able to nurture. Only he who is absolutely sincere can transform." (Chapter 23 of the same)</p>
<p>"Sincerity" is truth. The way of heaven and earth is nothing but truth, so it is said that "sincerity is the way of Heaven." "Seeking sincerity" is like seeking truth. It is not only seeking it, but also taking it as the standard for all actions and movements. This is the way of being human, so it is said that "it is the way of man." "Hitting upon what is right without effort" refers to actions; "apprehending without thinking" refers to knowledge; "easily and naturally embodies the Tao" means that in both knowledge and action, one can attain the Tao of the Mean, naturally and without any effort. This is what is called "sage." Sage is nothing else. The mind, body, inside and out, and all thoughts and actions are nothing but the ultimate Tao and principle, which is what is called "sincerity." The ultimate Tao and principle, from the perspective of its true and unwavering quality, is called sincerity; from the perspective of its neither excessive nor insufficient state, it is called the Mean. In fact, they are the same. "He who seeks sincerity" always adds vigilance and effort to the thoughts and actions of his mind and body in order to "choose what is good and firmly hold it fast." "Good" is the "Mean" that is neither excessive nor insufficient, and it is also the "sincerity" that is true and unwavering. The ultimate Tao and principle is here.</p>
<p>He who chooses what is good and firmly holds it fast exerts his mind to seek enlightenment of the ultimate Tao and principle, and exhausts his body's ability to embody it and practice it, so as not to lose it or fall away from it. This is the matter of "cultivating oneself." "Cultivating" means partial; attaining means reaching and exhausting. Partial refers to different things and matters; complete refers to common principles and public examples, which is what is called "sincerity." "Cultivating oneself" is like saying that one exhausts his partial knowledge, that is, investigates different things and matters, seeks to know the reasons for them, and then combines and connects them to reach the consistent common principles and public examples. This is the work of "seeking sincerity." The sage who is born with knowledge and acts in accordance with it, who is called "sincerity," is rarely seen in generations. Those who seek the next best thing are those who are called "cultivating oneself," so it is said that the next best thing is "cultivating oneself." However, accumulating the work of "cultivating oneself" will also lead to "sincerity," so it is said that "cultivating oneself can lead to sincerity." Once one reaches sincerity, then all that is known in the heart is the common principles and public examples, and all that is practiced by the body is the implementation of the common principles and public examples. What the body comes into contact with and practices are the different things and matters that have forms and traces that can be sought, so it is said that "it manifests itself." The common principles and public examples, which have no form or trace, are applied to the different things and matters that have traces and forms, and their effects are seen, so it is said that "it is distinguished." When principles and examples are distinguished among things, things all obtain the reasons for their existence, and what is obscure is not made clear, so it is said that "it is able to influence." Being able to influence the reasons for things, one can rely on their principles and examples to control and dominate them, so it is said that "it is able to transform." When influence transforms, changes arise; when changes arise, there is a way to adapt to the times and take what is appropriate to the circumstances. Its effects cannot be glimpsed by those who are confined to the empty and accustomed. Therefore, it is said that "it is able to nurture." The work of seeking sincerity is complete when one is able to nurture, so it is said that "only he who is absolutely sincere can nurture." Through cultivating oneself, one can also reach the ultimate sincerity and be able to nurture. This is the same as the work of Heaven's gift. Different paths lead to the same goal.</p>
<p>Indeed, "sincerity" is what is called "the sage of Heaven's gift." The completeness and wonderfulness of his innate virtue are the same as the natural nature of the way of Heaven. This is the ideal figure of our Confucianism, so he "inherits Heaven and establishes the ultimate," rectifies human relations, defines righteousness and principles, and is not subject to human relations, righteousness and principles. He is like Heaven and Earth in nature. As for "choosing what is good and firmly holding it fast," what is called "seeking sincerity" is actually a figure of reality. Although he is not a sage of Heaven's gift, he will eventually achieve the same work as "sincerity" through the exertion of effort over time. "Sincerity" is unattainable. To seek the next best thing is to "seek sincerity." From this, it can be seen that our Confucianism holds ideals, but also does not forget reality.</p>
<p>As for the way of "seeking sincerity" that it shows, the method of "choosing what is good and firmly holding it fast," it says: "Study extensively, inquire carefully, deliberate cautiously, discriminate clearly, and practice earnestly." (Chapter 20 of the same) Study, inquire, deliberate, and discriminate are used to choose what is good; earnest practice is used to firmly hold it fast. "Study" is to observe the conditions and states of things; "extensively" is like broadly. Broadly observing the conditions and states of things is to lengthen one's experience. "Inquiring carefully" is to carefully examine the experience of others in order to supplement what one's own ears and eyes cannot reach. "Deliberating" is to arrange and analyze what one has gained from experience, seek to connect them, and set up common principles and public examples; however, if one engages in this rashly, the defects of bias and crudeness will arise, so one must not deliberate without caution. "Discriminating" is to discriminate whether the connection is complete or not, and whether the common principles and public examples that have been set up are accurate or not; making them complete and accurate, then what has been set up is established and cannot be shaken again. Discriminating must be "clear," and if it is clear, then what is discriminated is precise and will not lead to errors. To seek to be like this, one must also broadly take real facts and things, and compare them with the established principles and examples to verify them. "Earnest practice" means holding fast to the common principles and public examples that have been established and cannot be shaken, and applying them to dealing with things and handling affairs, and truly reaping the benefits of their use. All of these are named learning's: "extensive study" and "careful inquiry" are to observe the relevant facts and collect them, (Observation for the enumeration of relevant instances) which is the first step of enumeration (also called induction); "cautious deliberation" is to explain the collected facts and create a hypothesis, (Explanation for the establishment of bypothesis) which is the second step of enumeration; "clear discrimination" is to reconstruct the hypothesis (that is, the established common principles and public examples) and establish them as common principles and public examples, (Establishisllment of general principle from the hypothesis) which is the third step of enumeration; using real facts and things to compare with the established principles and examples for verification, (Verification of the general principle by concrete instances) which is the fourth step of enumeration. As for "earnest practice," it is the implementation of the common principles and public examples, (Application of the general principle) which is also the matter of external derivation (also called deduction).</p>
<h3>The Way of Learning</h3>
<p>— Shaoxiong</p>
<p>The thing most to be feared in the way of learning is the word "obstruction." To have something is to have something not seen. To have something not seen is to be unable to obtain the whole of truth, to use a part of the truth to represent the whole truth, and to use a view that is not entirely accurate to represent a view that is entirely accurate. To obtain one end is to think that the whole is here, and there is no need to seek elsewhere. It is like blind men touching an elephant, each clinging to the part they touch as the whole of the elephant. The common disease of ancient and modern scholarship is mostly similar to this. Xunzi's discussion of learning advocates dispelling obstruction. The two words "dispelling obstruction" can be said to be uniquely insightful and best express the spirit of scholarship. There is nothing else in the way of learning besides this.</p>
<p>The common disease of the current academic world can be said to be the word "obstruction." Many academic disputes arise from obstruction. For example, some people are conservative, and some people are progressive. The conservatives believe that everything of the ancients is good. The way of learning is only to restore the past, only to read the classics, and only to promote the doctrines of ancient sages can we revive the decadence and reverse the fate. The progressives believe that everything of the ancients is not in line with the current era, is outdated and useless, and only by thoroughly eliminating it can we establish a new foundation. The way of learning lies in eliminating the old and establishing the new, and in introducing new theories and new ideas to replace the old. This struggle between the new and the old is due to each being obstructed. The conservatives are obstructed by the past and do not know the present, and the progressives are obstructed by the present and do not know the past. Each statement has its merits and demerits. To understand the past and be versed in the present is to be successful.</p>
<p>For example, some people believe that what our country needs most at present is applied science, so school education should focus on practicality. All subjects that are not related to practical applications, such as literature, philosophy, and even pure science, do not need to be emphasized. The way of learning lies in seeking practicality, not in empty theory. On the contrary, some people believe that the way of learning lies in seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge, in pursuing truth, and not in application. To take application as the purpose is enough to hinder the progress of learning and the discovery of truth. The reason why Western science has today's brilliant achievements is that Westerners can inherit the spirit of Greek philosophers who sought knowledge for the sake of knowledge, and get rid of the shackles of practicality, so that they can progress day by day and reach today. These statements from the south have their own truths and are each obstructed. The former is obstructed by practicality and does not know theory, and the latter is obstructed by theory and does not know practicality. True learning emphasizes both theory and practice.</p>
<p>There are many examples mentioned above, and we cannot enumerate them one by one. We can cite one more example to conclude. Some people believe that the way of learning lies in seeking creation, in the discovery of new ideas, and not in reading books, textual research, and clinging to the old sayings of the ancients. Learning values deep thought. As Mencius said, "Think and you will get it, do not think and you will not get it." Without deep thought, there is no such thing as learning. However, some people believe that the way of learning does not lie in seeking creation, but in reading books and observing. Learning must have a basis and cannot be created out of thin air. One must read many books and observe for a long time before one can talk about creation. Even Confucius, a sage, said, "Transmitting, not creating," how can we not read books and lightly talk about creation? These two aspects again have their own reasons, but they are also each obstructed. The former is obstructed by thought, and the latter is obstructed by learning. To think without learning or to learn without thinking is not right.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the way of learning lies in dispelling obstruction. To have obstruction in learning will lead to many unnecessary disputes. Professor Whitehead, a modern British philosopher, once said: "The true method of invention is like the soaring of an airplane in the sky. The airplane soars into the sky, rises from the ground, and then penetrates into the clouds. This method of invention also starts from the special observation on the ground, but then leaps into the sky-wide imagination of the generalized principle, and then descends to the ground again to re-observe, but its observation is more acute because it has been rationally explained." On the ground, one can see its details; in the sky, one can see its greatness. Therefore, one must be on the ground and also in the sky. The main reason is to seek to be unobstructed. The way of learning, is it in this!</p>
<h3>An Outline of Bosanquet's Aesthetics, Part One: The Characteristics of Aesthetic Experience</h3>
<p>— Han Yuwen</p>
<p>A simple aesthetic experience is a feeling of pleasure, or a feeling for something that is pleasurable.</p>
<p>Here, the so-called feeling of pleasure, being an aesthetic experience, is of course an aesthetic feeling of pleasure, which is naturally different from other feelings, such as material desires; the so-called pleasurable things naturally refer to beautiful things, not other pleasurable things, such as things that resolve material desires. Now, I will put forward three points to explain the characteristics of aesthetic experience or feeling.</p>
<p>Aesthetic experience is a stable feeling - the pleasure we feel in pleasurable things, that is, beautiful things, is different from the pleasure we feel in food. The former is aesthetic pleasure, and the latter is material desire. Material desire is a desire that arises from the needs of the body: when a person's body has a deficiency or unbalanced abnormality in physiology, he experiences an unstable and troubled emotion, and then intends to pursue what he lacks in order to satisfy his desires and restore his body to a balanced, quiet, and normal state in physiology. The satisfaction of this desire can be called satiety. The starting point of this intention is pain, and the end is satiety. Satiety is its purpose. In the relief of pain, there is a kind of pleasure. When the pain is relieved, the pleasure also gradually stops with that pursuing intention. Therefore, this pleasure is passive. It and the intention that accompanies it are in the process of time, and in its process, it shifts at any time, with increases and decreases in degree. Aesthetic pleasure is active. It is a kind of joy or accomplishment for the perfect form. Although you can forget all the troubles of the world in aesthetic appreciation and be intoxicated in the realm of perfection or be one with it, aesthetic activity is not caused by troubles or physiological imbalances. It is a creative activity of the most fulfilling life. In it, there is no lack or demand, and there is no so-called satiety. Although our actual act of appreciation certainly cannot but appear in time, in terms of the nature of appreciation, aesthetic experience is beyond time, with no difference between before and after. Our heart is always comfortable and at ease in aesthetic activities (athome). The perfection of a moment is like the perfection of eternity. The pleasure of an instant is like the pleasure of a long time. There is no change or growth and decline of time. Therefore, it cannot be said to have a beginning and an end. Our appreciation of perfection has no time for satiety. When we actually appreciate, for example, at a concert, we will indeed feel tired, but that is not because we have heard too much music or the music is too beautiful, just like overeating; but because our energy is not enough and we are idling. Aesthetic requirements have no time to be satisfied, so there is no time to wane.</p>
<p>Aesthetic experience is a related or relative feeling - that is to say, it is attached to or relative to the nature of an object, and at the same time it can be said that it is a special or concrete feeling. When we see something, or hear a sound, such as hearing the dinner bell, we can have many reasons, such as dinner is coming soon, to feel happy; but if this pleasant feeling is not caused by the actual sound of the bell itself, then it is not an aesthetic experience. Aesthetic feeling is caused by the special nature of an object. In other words, it is a feeling that arises for the special nature of a certain thing. It must have such an object, and have a special, concrete feeling for it. And, in fact, this feeling and the special nature of that thing are the same thing. Feelings that are opposite to aesthetic feelings, such as the general pleasant feeling of health that occurs with the growth of energy, may contain aesthetic components, or make us feel comfortable aesthetic conditions more easily; but in general, it is a general feeling rather than a feeling related to an object. The feeling in the aesthetic attitude is concretely expressed in an object. The degree of its concreteness is obviously considerable, and in principle it is considerable to everyone.</p>
<p>Aesthetic experience is a public feeling. You can tell it to others and share it with others, which is the reason for "sharing wonderful articles together"; and its value is not reduced because it is shared. This is the reason for "being happy alone is not as good as being happy with others, and being happy with a few is not as good as being happy with everyone." It can not only be shared with others, but also be understood by others. That is to say, aesthetic feelings are clear and can be expressed. If disputes about taste are really useless, then, disputes about aesthetic pleasure are just the opposite. It can be said that there is nothing more discussed than aesthetic pleasure, and there is nothing more beneficial than discussing aesthetic pleasure. Education is most important in aesthetic experience. The effect that education has on it is also the greatest. Liking something and not liking something are both paths to culture that are worthy of being called aesthetic experience.</p>
<p>The above are the three main characteristics of aesthetic experience. Aesthetic attitude obtains aesthetic objects in it. The first point is that aesthetic feelings have constancy. The second point is that aesthetic feelings have relevance. The third point is that it has commonality. But the three are closely linked, and are not isolated.</p>
<h3>The Power of Thought</h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>"Existence determines thought, and thought cannot determine existence," this is the claim of Marx and his followers. Under this claim, the power of thought seems to be denied. Thought cannot influence existence; thought is only a reflection of existence. When existence changes, thought cannot but change with it. In this way, thought becomes the least important thing. Historical change is purely a change of existence, and thought is powerless. Is this a fact? If it were a fact, we would not understand why human beings only use thought. But the fact is not like this. We do not have to go to other sources to find evidence to prove the power of thought. We can find many pieces of evidence of the power of thought from the very people who adhere to Marx's claims, from their actual behavior, and prove the fallacy of their claims.</p>
<p>First, what is the strategy that those who carry out Marx's claims, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, value most and consider indispensable? On the one hand, it is propaganda; on the other hand, it is control--the control of thought. The former is active, and the latter is passive. But whether active or passive, from our point of view, it is a sign of valuing the power of thought. What is propaganda? Propaganda is trying to use one's own thoughts to influence or manipulate the thoughts of others. If thought is powerless and unimportant, why spend so much effort to manipulate the thoughts of others? Also, if thought cannot determine existence, then any harmful or poisonous thought has no relationship to its prevalence. We can let false thoughts arise and die on their own, why bother to control them? To control thought is to assume that thought has power, enough to influence others and change existence. Therefore, in terms of the Communist Party's emphasis on propaganda and the control of thought, it implicitly affirms the power of thought.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of the current situation in the Soviet Union, is the Soviet Union's creation of today's situation a historical necessity? Or is it the power of thought? According to the American philosopher F. SC. Northrop, he believes that the Soviet Union's creation of today's situation is not because there is something that necessarily makes it so, but mostly because the leaders of the Soviet revolution adopted Marx's philosophical theory, forced others to accept it, and built their political actions and cultural institutions on Marx's theory, thus making it so. Therefore, what the current situation in the Soviet Union proves is not that the physical existence of production relations determines the individual's belief or thought about politics and society, but that Marx's philosophy, Marx's thought, determines the Soviet Union's social system and production relations today. (See his book "The Meeting of East and West," page 246) Those who study the Soviet revolution and its current situation, even the Communists, would never dare to deny the power of Marx's philosophy. Is this not proving the power of thought again?</p>
<p>It can be seen that the power of thought is undeniable. To deny the power of thought is tantamount to denying the reason why people are human. The main point of why people are human and different from animals is that humans have thought. The reason why humans can overcome difficulties, conquer nature, and survive to this day is also because humans have thought. A history of human culture is mostly a history of human thought. Without the power of thought, there would never be today's human culture. The progress of history is, on the one hand, the progress of existence itself, and on the other hand, the progress of human thought. Existence can naturally determine thought, but thought can also determine existence. Marx's philosophy and the Soviet Union is the most obvious example.</p>

<p>Gao Xun asks: My friend, Cha Jia's sister, married Yi some years ago (hereafter referred to as Yi). Yi has now passed away for two years. There is no family property, and Jia's sister had no children with Yi. Now, the sister wants to remarry Bing. I have some questions and would appreciate your answers. Jia's sister is a widow and now wants to marry Bing. Is this legally permissible? What kind of procedures should be followed to make it legal? If Jia's sister now marries Bing without the consent of Yi's family, can Yi's family interfere or file a lawsuit?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] It is permitted by law, but marriage should still be according to Article 982 of the Civil Code. They cannot interfere.</p>

<h3>On Drinking</h3>
<p>— Ping Gong</p>
<p>Drinking is no easy matter. Some people think they "can" drink, simply because they can drink three or five catties of yellow wine without getting drunk, or maybe they can gulp down a large glass of vodka in one go. But can the person who drinks the most be considered the person who drinks the "best"? The charm of art lies partly in the blank spaces, and the interest in conversation lies mostly in moments of silence – the person who constantly gulps down large cups of alcohol probably only makes you think he is a bit like a bull.</p>
<p>To be able to drink to the point of "just right" is like seeking the right balance in life, and naturally becomes an art. When an artist creates a work, in addition to skillful technique, he also needs a sudden inspiration. This inspiration is fleeting, so many masterpieces meet with a premature demise in the bud. Drinking also has this uncontrollable aspect, so drinking "well" is really extremely rare.</p>
<p>First of all, "drinking mood" is not easy to come by. By drinking mood, I think it is actually just a moment of feeling some leisure in one's state of mind. Whether one is busy with official duties during the day, or simply has nothing to do and has lazed around all day, if at dusk one suddenly feels the idea of "how about a little drink," then one puts aside the whole day's busyness or boredom, and just wants to drink – this is really the time to have a little drink, because only at this time can one drink with composure. Some people have become accustomed to drinking and cannot sleep without it, while others use alcohol as a tool to dispel sorrow, with forgetting as the purpose of drinking – the excuses may vary, but they all treat alcohol as opium or morphine. Since they intend to anesthetize themselves, how can they still appreciate the true pleasure of drinking! Therefore, only drinking that is "done for no purpose" is true drinking, and only then can one reach the state of Tao Yuanming's "wanting to discern, but already forgotten the words."</p>
<p>Some people like to bottoms up, and even force others to do the same. The taste of the wine hasn't even been carefully appreciated before it is hurriedly swallowed. Such people drink like elementary school students submitting their test papers, thinking that submitting the first paper is a way to show off, without caring whether they will pass. They don't know that the taste of wine can actually be divided into "head" and "tail." When you first raise your glass, you first see the bright color and the rich aroma, and then slowly sip it. At that time, the color, aroma, and taste of the wine all rush to the tip of your tongue, imbibing the fragrance and containing the jade nectar. This sip can be called the "head of the wine." Then, slowly swallow it, as if there is a lingering fragrance, and this aftertaste can be called the "tail of the wine." Even tea must be slowly "tasted," so why must drinking be done hastily like a child taking medicine, seeking only to swallow it without bothering to distinguish the taste! My friend Mr. Xu Gu likes to drink, but many people are afraid to drink with him, because they say that Xu Gu drinks too slowly. They don't know that it is precisely because Xu Gu can drink slowly that he is sometimes able to write pure and beautiful short poems.</p>
<p>Having a drinking mood is a kind of clarity. I don't think this is an exaggeration, because the drinking mood is very difficult to come by and very easy to disappear. Sometimes, just as you have prepared the cups and chopsticks and are about to have a little drink, suddenly the radio next door starts playing Shaoxing opera loudly, and you immediately have no way to continue. Shanyin is a place that produces famous wine and famous scholars, but it also produces the disgusting Shaoxing opera, probably because of the principle of mutual generation and restraint. Otherwise, everyone would probably rush to live in Shaoxing, to truly roam on the "Shanyin Road."</p>
<h3>Secret Method</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>I remember a Qing Dynasty record that goes like this: There was a man in Hangzhou who sold secret methods. He sealed the methods inside paper bags, with names like "Secret Method for So-and-So," "Secret Method for So-and-So" written on the outside. A person bought three strips for three hundred coins, called "Guaranteed Prosperity for the Household," "Staying Sober While Drinking," and "Cutting Off the Root of Production." After the selection was made, the seller of secret methods said to the buyer in a very serious tone: "These methods are extremely effective. When you get home, secretly open them and do as they say. Be careful not to spread them to others." The buyer happily went home and opened them in a secret room. They read "Diligence and Thrift," "Disperse Early," and "Frequently Lift." The buyer was greatly disappointed and filled with regret.</p>
<p>Originally, secret methods are not good to expose, once exposed they cease to be secret methods. Like Liu Nan’s hidden pen, “Tang Su Shichang served as governor, because the people did not follow the teachings, he blamed himself and voluntarily kowtowed in the capital street. The Wubo hated his trickery and whipped him until he bled. Shichang could not bear the pain and cried out and ran away, and the spectators all held their stomachs.” This is also a secret method, but it is a pity that the secret method was exposed, and the result was not effective. The aforementioned Hangzhou man spent three hundred coins to buy three secret methods, thinking that he would be able to get his wish, but when he opened them, he saw such ordinary words, and therefore was disappointed and regretful, but the principle cannot be changed, and he can’t do anything to the seller. I think this is not because the "method" is not effective, the "method" has already given you an excellent revelation, you yourself think it is ordinary, not rare, then it can not blame the law, only blame yourself for not being able to do as it says. Things in the world are originally very ordinary. Zhuge Liang is not extraordinary, his life is only about "caution". Zeng Guofan has no other strengths, his life is only about "paying attention to everything". Please think: Is there really any other secret method besides "diligence and thrift" for "guaranteed prosperity for the household"?</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Rat-Peering Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>The Estrangement between Weng and Li in the History of Political Strife in the Late Qing Dynasty (Part 2)</p>
<p>Li Shangyang (Hongzao) and Weng Changshu (Tonghe) were in the Grand Council, where they slandered each other and mobilized their followers to fight. Li Ciming, because he was allied with Weng, used extremely harsh words in his Yuemantang Diary to slander Zhang Xiangtao, Chen Taoan, and others, and his tone lost its restraint. This gentleman had a narrow mind, and his hatred of Xiangtao was not entirely due to partisanship. Xiangtao's discourteous treatment of him was also a factor. Yuemantang Diary, Guangxu 3rd year, 2nd month: "When I arrived at Xiangtao's house, his rabble servants were particularly forceful in refusing me. I scolded them and went straight in, sitting in the reception room. After about two hours, the master still did not appear. I was neither willing to endure the humiliation for the sake of my life, nor did I want to argue with him about scholarship, and lightly accepting this insult was my fault." Guangxu 8th year, 5th month: "Recently, the northerners, the two Zhangs and one Li (referring to Li Gaoyang and Youqiao Xiangtao), echo each other internally and externally. Zhang uses Li to increase his importance, and Li uses Zhang for his own purposes. They probe into imperial intentions, widely build party alliances, and the descendants of the Eight Banners advance rapidly through shortcuts. They show no skill in learning, and are insane. I wish I could be in a position to impeach those rats!" Although Ciming was so vitriolic, a reading of Changshu's diary reveals that he praised Xiangtao without any critical words and was happy that he was specially promoted to Governor of Shanxi. On the other hand, Xiangtao insisted on keeping the draft to criticize Changshu. His "Guangyatang Poetry Collection" has a poem "Sending the Literary Official Weng Zhongyuan from His Father Mr. Yaofang's Exile to the Frontier," with a note: "When Mr. Yaofang was in prison, I visited him twice and recorded this poem to show that my friendship with the Weng family was not shallow. Later, Prime Minister Shuping (Li Hongzao) was determined to slander him, and he was only spared death, not unlike Qi Zhang to Zanhuang. This kind of karmic relationship is incomprehensible." Mr. Yaofang was Tongshu, Changshu's third brother, who was impeached by Zeng Guofan while serving as Governor of Anhui and was exiled. Xiangtao used this to blame Changshu for being heartless, but he did not know that in political infighting, even siblings can be disregarded. How could this small favor be of any importance? Xiangtao's argument is truly illogical!</p>
<p>Weng Changshu's diary seems to have been revised by his descendants (or perhaps he himself deleted and revised it during his lifetime, which is also unknown). His evaluations of people mostly leave good comments and rarely show deep analysis. Xiangfan and Youqiao were people he extremely disliked, but his diary only contains praise, probably to show his magnanimity. However, the true facts of history cannot be known. In these respects, I think Li Ciming's straightforwardness is more admirable. The Yuemantang Diary records Youqiao's marriage to the Li family of Hefei, roughly saying: "Hefei has only one daughter, born to his second wife, Madam Zhao."</p>
<h3>Angle</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>Downstairs in my house, in the back rooms, lived a mother and daughter-in-law. The son worked as a civil servant in a small county in eastern Zhejiang. On the first of each month, after receiving his "crane salary," he would remit it to Shanghai for household expenses. On the fifth of this month, the money was remitted, and the daughter-in-law, as usual, brought the remittance slip upstairs, "Mr. Wang, thank you for helping me to redeem the money."</p>
<p>I put the remittance slip away. In the evening, when I passed by the back rooms, I handed the two million yuan I had brought back to them. As I entered the room, the old lady hurriedly stepped forward, welcoming me and saying, "Mr. Wang, you've come at just the right time. Because A Long's money has been remitted, we quickly bought a dan of rice. Now the shop assistant at the rice store is waiting to collect the cash. Just think, on the first the price of rice was only 700,000, but today it is already 780,000. If you, Mr. Wang, get the money on the first and buy rice, wouldn't you save 80,000 per dan!"</p>
<p>I asked her to check the amount and went back upstairs. In my heart, I was calculating that this A Long was in a small county, and his treatment was even more meager than civil servants of the same level in Shanghai. The money was remitted to Shanghai and took three or four days to arrive. The dan of rice that her family bought was indeed 80,000 more expensive than buying on the first.</p>
<p>Walking into my own room, Xiao Zhang, whom I hadn't seen in a long time, was sitting on the sofa waiting for me. As soon as I saw him, we shook hands happily: "Hello, Old Wang, are you busy? How are you?"</p>
<p>"Xiao Zhang, how are you? The price of rice has been rising sharply recently. Are you making a good profit in the rice market?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zhang shook his head at me, "Don't mention it. Yesterday I sold a batch of rice and lost at least 80,000 at a time."</p>
<p>"How could you lose money? Isn't the price of rice reporting a rise these days?"</p>
<p>"It's precisely the reported rise that's causing the problem. I sold it at 780,000. You think, these days the North and South markets are so active, and there are countless people in the market holding onto the price and not letting go. It is said that in less than a week, it will rise another 10%. I had to sell it at a cheap price because I had to send an urgent letter to my hometown, waiting to pay a deposit for building a house. Think about it, if it rises another 10%, wouldn't it jump up another 80,000 or so? If I wait for the peak, compared to now, I have lost a profit."</p>
<p>After chatting for a while, Xiao Zhang left. The news about the price of rice is that the price of rice will not rise, because the production area is not rising, and the authorities are trying their best to dredge the source, and it is expected to fall to about 700,000 in the near future. At the same time, the authorities are preparing a unified allocation policy for daily necessities for people's livelihoods, and loans have stopped. It is expected that the general price of goods will be stimulated by this and will collapse together. Therefore, the fall in the price of rice is a natural and reasonable thing.</p>
<h3>Medicine is More Expensive Than Blood</h3>
<p>— Shi Baiwu's Writing, Gao Longsheng's Painting</p>
<p>It is said that even today, Chongqing is still considered to have the best and most pediatricians in China. During the War of Resistance, of course, the nation's famous doctors were concentrated in the wartime capital. Afterwards, everyone returned to their original positions, and most of the famous doctors who wanted to stay could not. However, pediatrics is still bustling with patients.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was because the citizens of Chongqing emphasized "protecting the young," but when I asked, it was not the case. "It's just that the children of middle-class civil servants and teachers are often sick," said a pediatrician authority: "Children are generally suffering from indigestion, and the reason for indigestion is due to the 'tooth sacrifice' system."</p>
<p>People who have lived in Chongqing are generally familiar with the term "tooth sacrifice." It is because people with usually poor nutrition regularly—once a week or ten days to half a month—eat a better dish to supplement their insufficient calories. It is said that the teeth and mouth have been too bitter, so they periodically "sacrifice" to them, "serving them with offerings."</p>
<p>So the children of civil servants and teachers in a half-starved state are in luck. If they don't have a tooth sacrifice, that's fine, but if they do, they fill their stomachs like hungry tigers. How can stomachs that are not accustomed to rich and greasy food not get sick after this sacrifice!</p>
<p>Even though they cannot usually "cherish" themselves with full stomachs, when they get sick, they have no choice but to sell their clothes and pawn their belongings to pay for medical treatment.</p>
<p>But the disease is really unaffordable to treat, at least for civil servants and teachers. In terms of medicine, Chongqing is at least two or three times to five or six times more expensive than Shanghai, even though all commodity prices are said to be cheaper than Shanghai. One thousand CC of American-made glucose saline solution transported from Shanghai cost 450,000 yuan a bottle in Chongqing a month ago, when the price in Shanghai was 70,000 or 80,000 yuan. Therefore, the doors of church hospitals, which are said to be charitable institutions, are often lined with rickshaws, and the people on the rickshaws are people who cannot afford the hospitalization fees. Some are waiting for their families to run around begging for loans, while others have already died on the rickshaws before they could wait for emergency treatment. – Everyone knows that Chongqing's church hospitals have long had no subsidies from the church and rely on business income to support themselves.</p>
<p>I personally witnessed a fifteen-year-old girl who ranked first in her school—I swear to God I am not lying—die because her father—a middle-ranking civil servant—could not afford emergency treatment. A cultural figure who has been engaged in the profession for more than 20 years could not afford American blood plasma and had to use his own blood to transfuse his wife to save her life.</p>
<h3>Xiaoyao Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 3: On Stage and Off Stage</p>
<p>That night, after Xu Zhuzhai returned from Gu Qiwan's house, the charming but bold impression Qiwan left on him was firmly imprinted in his mind. He felt that the rumors outside that Qiwan was demanding high prices for her services, had a bad temper, and did not care for her family, etc., were completely wrong. Today was their first meeting, and she revealed all the hardships she had endured, which showed that she had a very straightforward personality. She was a very ambitious woman who constantly strived for progress, and she gave him a very good impression today. Because of her, Zhuzhai tossed and turned all night.</p>
<p>The next day, near closing time at the bank, Qiwan sent a letter containing two tickets to the Kaiming Theater, along with a note written in pencil: "Hoping Mr. Xu can come tonight, Qiwan." After Zhuzhai read the letter, his mind was immediately in turmoil again. Afraid that his colleagues would see it and make fun of him, he quickly put the letter in his pocket, walked out of the bank, and thought to himself, she sent me two tickets, of course I have to go. But who should I go with? I can't provoke the colleagues in the bank, and no one at home is available, so I can only ask my cousin Yi Yunqing. She usually loves to watch plays, and she is also knowledgeable about the lyrics, so going with her would allow for some discussion. Having made up his mind, he hired a car and hurried to Zhang Yunqing's house on Duofu Lane. When he asked at the door, he learned that Old Mrs. Zhang had gone to Tianjin, and only Miss Zhang was at home. Zhuzhai went straight upstairs, where Yunqing was knitting a sweater in the room. Seeing Zhuzhai come in, she sat still and simply nodded, saying, "Cousin, you haven't come in days. It's so boring being home alone since my mother went to Tianjin." Zhuzhai walked up to her and took out the theater tickets from his pocket, saying, "If you're free, let's go see a play tonight." As soon as Yunqing saw the tickets, she reached out and took them, asking, "Who's in the play?" Zhuzhai said, "It's Gu Qiwan at the Kaiming Theater." Yunqing laughed, "I'm asking you what play it is!" Zhuzhai was stumped by her question, scratching his head and saying, "What play is it? I don't even know!" Yunqing laughed, "Inviting someone to a play, but you don't even know what play it is!" Zhuzhai said, "It doesn't matter, we can look it up in the newspaper." As he said this, he picked up the newspaper on the coffee table and exclaimed, "Great, great! It's Qiwan performing 'The Peach Blossom on a Human Face'." Yunqing said, "The play 'The Peach Blossom on a Human Face' is very touching!" Zhuzhai said, "The Peach Blossom on a Human Face is the story of Cui Hu's farewell to the nun, a sentimental and beautiful play, and when Qiwan performs it, it will definitely be tender and moving." Yunqing said, "You haven't even seen her, how do you know?" Zhuzhai said, "Qiwan is best at performing this kind of play, don't you also love watching this kind of play?" Yunqing smiled slightly, glanced at Zhuzhai, a touch of shyness flitted across her face, and she slowly lowered her head, as if there were endless feelings in her heart. Zhuzhai stood behind her and saw that the photo he had given her under the glass on the table was still placed there properly. The half-length photo had been colored and was very harmonious.</p>
<h3>Alumni and Alma Mater</h3>
<p>— Sheng Xue</p>
<p>The position of President of Beiyang University has been vacant for some time, arousing much attention. In the south, old alumni such as Wang Chonghui and Wang Zhengting sent telegrams to Liu Xianshou urging him to take the position. In the north, alumni such as Tan Bingxun have been running around to maintain the university. Although they have left the school for many years, their enthusiasm for their alma mater is no less than that of the students in the student union.</p>
<p>This summer, when Peking University took over Duan Wangfu Engineering School, many old alumni (i.e., graduates of the former Industrial Vocational School and the Engineering College of Peking University) launched a movement to protect the school. In addition to holding meetings, issuing leaflets, and sending telegrams, they joined the students at the school in closing the gates and tightly guarding the instruments in the various experimental factories when the takeover took place. They even scolded the personnel taking over. The situation was similar when Beiyang took over last year. On the one hand, they opposed the merger with other schools; on the other hand, they telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting independent funding and an independent college. Similarly, the demands of Normal University and Tangshan Institute of Technology to return to National Jiaotong University have all been echoed by alumni and students.</p>
<p>This reminds me of an incident I personally experienced. In 1919, when Peking University was reorganized, the engineering department was transferred to Beiyang (while Beiyang's law department was transferred to Peking University). When old alumni working on the Yuehan Railway far away in Guangdong learned of this news from the newspapers, more than 20 people led by Wu Cifeng sent me a long letter. They said that the university's separation of departments had originally included an engineering department, and that national construction required engineering talents. From a historical, academic, or any other perspective, Peking University had no reason to abolish the engineering department. The graduates could not stand idly by, and they were holding this public letter as representatives to strongly argue with the Peking University authorities to try to save the situation. On another piece of paper, they wrote many words of encouragement: "Among the engineering alumni, only you, brother, are in Beijing. This matter is of great importance and you cannot shirk your responsibility. We await good news." I was also excited upon receiving this letter and immediately visited President Cai Jiemin! Although I was alone and weak, I planned to imitate the weeping at the Qin court and do my best. To my surprise, after meeting, Mr. Cai said that this was a comprehensive reform of the academic system, and not a question of the survival or abolition of the engineering department. If we were to preserve the engineering department, the entire situation would inevitably revert to the old ways, which would be difficult to accept. Please forgive me. I felt that his reasons were sufficient and there was no way to force the matter, so I replied to the alumni thousands of miles away accordingly.</p>
<p>Observing the above situations in a comprehensive manner, it can be seen that the concern of alumni for their alma mater is indeed of considerable importance.</p>
<p>The loyalty of faculty and students to the school may be said to be a matter of vested interest (or at least has an element of vested interest), while alumni have graduated long ago in terms of academic pursuits, and have left the school for many years; in terms of career, they have long had their own prospects and do not need to rely on their alma mater. However, they are even more enthusiastic and激越 about the rise and fall, separation and reunion of their alma mater than the students at the school. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>I once talked to an alumnus, and he said: When working outside, one relies on one's background. When others ask about diplomas and origins, even the names of the school or department one graduated from have disappeared. They are neither "produced in the empty mulberry" nor are they any different from "children without mothers"! These words were extremely painful, but they are only one reason and not the root cause. Even when this "Advanced Industrial School" was renamed "Industrial Vocational School," the alumni did not feel resentful because of the disappearance of the old name. When the "Railway Management School" was renamed Jiaotong University, there was no difference. When the "Industrial Vocational School" was upgraded to the "Industrial University," not only was there no opposition, but there was also great joy. When verifying the diploma, isn't it always a mismatch between name and reality, and the answer is not what was asked? Why is it that changing the name to a certain college of a certain university is considered a major change, and people speak out when they feel injustice?</p>
<p>From this perspective, historical sentiment and the psychology of self-esteem transcend considerations of vested interests and become a pure and innate trait. The expression of this trait does not necessarily conform to understanding, but it has the most precious value, which is the greatest factor in the national resistance war.</p>
<h3>Quit Smoking!</h3>
<p>— Ya Nong</p>
<p>A small civil servant—including myself—looks like someone of a higher class, but in reality is just someone of a "lower class," at least a subordinate under a large civil servant. If one insists on "puffing oneself up to look fat," then one is bound to be even worse off than a "lower class" person, and the hidden pain suffered in their life is even deeper than that of a "lower class" person.</p>
<p>Having become a small civil servant, one indispensable item abroad is an "old coat," just like in the situation depicted by the novelist Gogol. In our China, one must also drag along a tattered long gown, as if without it, one is not qualified to join the ranks of the "higher class." Speaking of cigarettes, they also cannot be spared or quit. If one insists on quitting smoking, some who are considered the most clever will display their political insight and say, "Am I quitting cigarettes? I am truly compelled!"</p>
<p>My wife, beside my chair, said, "The food supplies have been used up particularly quickly these past few days. Relatives are coming and going incessantly, eating here every day. Look, the rice bought at the end of last month is already more than half a dan gone. What should we do? Should we buy another dan?"</p>
<p>The room was filled with the smoke I exhaled, and the sound of trucks outside the window was deafening, making the room seem even quieter. Why? One reason is to respond to the thrift campaign, and the other is to cultivate an honest atmosphere. As for not having money to smoke, even if you say it, it's better to keep it to yourself. Look at everything from a political point of view. Complaining about personal poverty used to be like saying a gentleman is steadfast in poverty; now, it's better to apply a phrase that the whole country is in poverty. Isn't this more resonant and powerful? Why not do it!</p>
<p>Even more pitiful are the real small civil servants. In the current situation of traffic congestion and soaring prices, the "difficulty of living" cannot be concealed. They can't take off their long gowns, and they want to quit smoking but haven't, or they have quit and started again, trapped in the so-called藕斷絲連 (remaining connected despite breaking apart) situation, which is everywhere. Their mental state is like Shanghainese saying goodbye reluctantly. Cigarettes, to them, are simply touching hard-hearted people, a lingering and affectionate 香君 (fragrant lady) (certainly not the historical Li Xiangjun!). Before parting, they often first reduce the frequency of their interactions, superficially maintaining appearances with 香君; however, maintaining appearances is pitiful, and vain compromises are hard to fill. After some time, they seem to realize the pain of not having money to smoke, and with 香君, "friendship is good, but transactions require money; measure your virtue and capacity, it's hard to manage." So, quit! But they still can't help but groan: "No money to squander, my strength is not enough, it's not that I don't love her enough, I am truly compelled!" This is like talking at length about "difficulties," asking the other party for "understanding." However, cigarettes are not living things after all. No matter how much you shout until your throat is hoarse, saying a thousand or ten thousand times "香君 is gone, how can I bear the sadness!" The sadness is only for you, the civil servant, alone. The other party doesn't appreciate it at all. Not only are you unwilling to say sternly, "From now on, we break up and go our separate ways," but instead, you say with tears in your eyes, "Temporary separation, we will meet again in the future. If the situation permits, we will reunite."</p>
<p>Perhaps one day in the future, your superior or colleague will offer you a cigarette, and you will feel as happy as if a mistress had given you a kiss, and you will gladly accept this kiss. May I ask: What is the difference between the so-called frugality on the lips of ordinary people and the quitting smoking on the lips of this small civil servant? The reason why I am saddened is precisely because of this.</p>
