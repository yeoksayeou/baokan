<h3>迅籌黃泛區善後的必要</h3>
<p>黃河花園口堵口工程，於本月十五日慶告合龍；此一關係蘇魯皖豫四省安危之大事，工程圓滿告成，消息傳來，四省欣慰，正在首都舉行之三中全會特致電嘉慰堵口員工，足徵黃河合龍，關係國計民生之鉅！</p>
<p>黃河為我國主要的水道，其歷史與中華民族同樣悠久，自禹導河成功，河不為害，其間有漢唐之盛。五代，黃河有自北而東勢，宋又自東而南，降及金元，其勢日趨於南，而不可收拾。黃河每一潰決，必橫溢千里，生命物產同遭浩劫，國家元氣每受絕大損害，於是黃河遂有「中國的悲哀」之稱。所以在過去，黃河潰決，必竭天下之力以塞之，因此河政水利除設有專管的河道機關外，亦成為歷代牧民之官的要政。我國對日抗戰發生，黃河於廿七年六月在花園口潰決，九年以來，脫離故道，土地人民在浸災中，房屋田園悉被衝毀，災情慘重，可以想像。據抗戰勝利後的統計，黃河泛區損失，僅以豫蘇皖三省而言，耕地被淹千三百餘萬畝，人民死亡近百萬，未亡者，老贏轉於溝壑，壯者散之四方，尚無可計算。國府復員後，水利委員會與聯總行總，竭全力搶救災荒，並設堵復局，動員廣大人力，和技術專家，終日在廣袤沙野，朔風凜冽，胼手砥足，與洪水鬥爭，與大自然角力，工程經過是一個月，終慶告成，從此河流東向，返還故道。據廿日濟南電告，黃河故道水頭，已流過魯境，　魯人均有久別重逢之親切。而豫皖蘇三省災區流民，亦可重返故國，得以歸耕。所以說黃河合龍，不僅為人民之幸，抑且為國家之幸。同時我們也認為，政府復員後做了一件富國利民，興利除害的大事。</p>
<p>黃河最危險的時期，為桃·伏·秋·凌四汛，去年伏汛前，堵口工程將成，詎中共突提問題，以堵口工程須停五個月，坐視功敗垂成，慘局重演。去年底政府與中共談判堵口問題，而爭論未定，黃河凌汛已來。爭論到今年二月，水利委員會長薛篤弼與中共獲得協定，下游中共區復堤工作，應即開始，水利曾津貼四十億，作下游復堤工款；堵口工程照常進行，於三月中旬合龍。按凌汛期在春二，桃汛期在四月，故汛區三十四縣人民，暨農田水利技術專家，咸認今年三月為難胞最後關頭，合龍則生，不合龍則死。堵復局暦千辛萬苦，計劃三月六日開始合龍，因花園口部份邊塌，發生墊陷險象，又延至八日晚開始合龍，因水勢洶湧，怒濤奔騰，乃於千鈞一髮中，百萬人民拋石堵塞，十五日得慶告合龍；水流入引河，循行故道。此種興利除害的大工程告成，人民尚慶倖不暇，乃中國又復橫生異議，以為此事未經共同商談；關於此點，薛篤弼亦已函覆總聯駐華辦事處艾格頓氏解釋。此一小小餘波，實為一種遺憾。政府的責任，及百里之官的所司，應為國為民創千秋之利，如捨利而求害，坐視桃汛降臨，置人民生死不顧，是為妄行。但由此可知，國家如欲進步，建設成功，必須統一安定，否則一條黃河，亦坐視其決之東方則東流，決之西方則西流了。</p>
<p>現在黃河合龍工程告成，三中全會亦致電嘉慰，從此千里滔滔，再獲安瀾之慶。我們認為此功不可減，希望政府在實際措施上，應嘉獎堵復工程之各級員工，尤其對外藉專家暨我國水利技術人員，尤應從優議獎，以昭激勵。顧亭林有云：「天下無難舉之功，存乎其人而已。」須知黃河堵口之告成，費盡技術專家的肝腦，暨百萬人民的血汗，則論功行賞。亦足以策勵國人對建設心理的發育，建國前途，所關匪輕。抑尤有進者。黃河泛區人民，九年來飽經艱辛，現仍流離沙野中，如何使之重返故里。如何使之恢復耕作，並如何免除其兵役及租稅，均有待政府迅作決定，速謀善後，不要讓這大片泛區荒蕪下去，不要讓廣大人民永在無依無靠中，試想今日我國中心地帶，如有一塊沙漠，一副流民圖，豈不遺害無窮？今天我們慶告黃河合龍以後，認為黃河泛區的善後，已迫在眼前，必須籌謀良策！必須速作善後！這樣，政府的施政，總算有始終，有本末！廣大人民皆引領而望，希望府政擔負起這個責任，將中原這塊樂土，建設起來！</p>

<h3>代理國務卿艾克遜闡明　美援助希土政策　不信此舉足以引起戰爭　希土自由若崩潰全世界均將蒙害</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜今日在衆院外委會，對於杜魯門總統所提援助希臘土耳其案，提供補充意見，字斟句酌，措辭非常愼重。據稱援助希土兩國對抗共產主義，不致引起戰爭，惟希臘與中國之局勢，美國政府認爲未能相提並論。衆院外交委員會如不能迅速有所決定則在反抗共產主義各國或將連續發生不利於美國之反響。艾氏旋並向記者閘明下列十項意見：（一）希土兩國申請之四億美元中三億元將貸予希臘，其餘貸與土耳其；（二）另需款若干以維持朝鮮南部現狀，數目尙未決定，所傳五億元之說絕對不確；（三）政府不承認中國與希臘局勢可相比擬。中國共黨控制中國廣大地區，自有政府與軍隊；（四）美國不擬在希臘重新籌辦選舉，（五）援助希土不得視作門羅主義伸展而及全世界。美國援助希土出於各該國政府之請求，並非干涉；（六）不應認爲美國在其他各國亦將推行同一政策；（七）就經濟或士氣觀點言，希土二國如告崩潰，其東方各國勢將感受極大影嚮。如謂自繼靼尼爾海峽以迄中國領海間各國均密切注視希土之結局，亦非言之過甚；（八）歐洲人民正在掙扎修補戰後餘創，圖保自由獨立，對希土局勢亦密切注意；（九）美國不擬出兵與希臘遊擊隊作戰；（十）美國援助希土蓋因不敢冒險等待聯合國機構採取行動。希土現有經費僅敷輸入主要物品十四日之用。</p>
<p>艾氏言論措辭謹愼，竭力避免直接牽涉蘇聯，但當其鄭重答復政府方案是否將引起戰爭時，意義了然無誤。渠稱：「余並不認爲足以引起戰爭」。或詢以土耳其能否依賴聯合國機構保障其國家完整，艾氏答稱：「設足下爲士耳其人，則旣知聯合國機構並無軍隊，對依賴一事，不得不躊踏再三矣。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜今日在衆院外委會預測杜魯門總統援希土助計劃不致引起對蘇戰爭時，曾提出警人秘密文件多種，分交各委員參考。該項文件係巨型活頁筆記簿形式，闡明美國地中海政策之背景。委員會卞席伊頓主張公佈此項秘密文件，共和黨議員四人附　。據伊頓吿記者稱：「處理此項文件之惟一方法厥爲公布全部事實」。艾氏明日仍將出席該委員會答復問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿日電〕美參院外交委員會定於下星期一下午起開始聆取援助希士法案之意見。</p>
<h3>美將擴大對外援助　勞工部長透露</h3>
<p>〔合眾社舊金山廿日電〕勞工部長希范侖巴克本日在福利供樂部發表演說，公開表示美國阻遏共產主義發展之援助或將展延至希土兩國以外之國家。希氏幷稱；杜魯門總統深信如不援助希土兩國，則其他國家之自由亦將趨於崩潰，而共產主義最後必將統治全世界。希氏之言雖未直指蘇聯，但弦外之音不問可知。希氏繼稱：「希土兩國或非事實上需要美國援助之唯一國家」。但幷未說明其他國家爲何國。希氏在發表此項演說前，曾於記者招待會中要求通過憲法之修正案，以取締美國之共產黨。</p>
<h3>美謀打破美蘇在韓僵局　籌設韓南臨時獨立政府　對韓政策即將作澈底改變</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕據消息靈通方面表示，朝鮮南部軍政府殆將撤廢，而代以朝鮮臨時獨立政府，現在之軍事總督一聯，將由文職高級專員繼任。此爲美國對朝鮮政策之澈底改變，將於何時實行，現尙不知，但據各種指示，大概不出數月。當馬歇爾國務卿啓程赴草斯科前，據稱，已訓令國務院繼續探究朝鮮局勢及美國對韓政策，其目的即欲打破美蘇兩國在朝鮮之僵局。目前所指示之改變，如果實施，足見國務院已迅速執行馬氏訓令，決定新政策。迄今官方對於此種徵兆雖一無表示，但可斷言美國估領軍爲維持安全起見，仍將留駐朝鮮。霍奇中將現在美國，是否將回任駐韓美軍司令尙屬問題。若果實行調整，則現由雷區少將擔任之軍事總督一職當予裁撤。關於朝鮮南部之變動範團，現有種種理由可信美國將賦與臨時獨立政府以實際上之主權，而僅受高級專員監督。此間更預料國務院將請國會於通過杜魯門總統援助希土兩國之提議後，立即討州論朝鮮問題。其請求中並將列入撥款二億美元，處理朝鮮之軍事及經濟局勢一項。此新計劃一旦實施，將爲李承晚之澈底勝利。</p>
<h3>美國人士觀察　蘇對美新政策反應</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿日電〕莫斯科若干美國人士間現有一種傾向，以爲杜魯門總統之援助希臘土耳其計劃，配以美國在四外長會議中之堅決態度，已使蘇聯措手不及，知難而退。甚至有謂美國此種堅決態度業已奏效，蘇聯態度已趨軟化。惟就聯合社駐莫斯科記者所知，事情實上絕不如此。第一，蘇聯不易受恐嚇；第二，蘇聯大槪有一非常積極的路綫，正循之而進，蘇聯絕不以消極計劃參加任何會議；第三，蘇聯看淸當前眞正危險之徵象。</p>
<h3>美交還水島機塲</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕美陸軍航空部已將氷島飛機塲之管制，交還氷島政府，惟美國之軍用及民用飛機仍可在該處降陸。</p>
<h3>四強外長會議檢討　奧國問題報告書　貝文將建議組織德聯邦政府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教廿一日廣播：四國外長今日舉行第十一次會議，聽取外次會議對於奧國問題所提出之報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：據消息靈通方面談稱：貝文將建議未來之德國政府採行美國及加拿大之聯邦制。據稱，貝文將於今日外次報吿對奧和約草擬情形以後，提出該項建議，其內容包括兩院制及個別之州治，如美國然，惟當選總統之行政權絕無僅有。預料美法兩國將贊成此項計劃，黨聯素主組織强有力之中央政府，對此建議，料將反對。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社德黑　廿日電〕某通訊社驗莫斯科記者來電稱，四國外長業已同意准許伊朗參加對德和會。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿一日電〕外交部今日宣布，義大利將參加對德和約之談判，但是否僅提出備忘錄或實地派遣代表與會則不可知。</p>
<h3>英法代表一番舌戰</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿日電〕四國外長本日舉行第十次會議，法代表皮杜爾表示，增加德國煤斤輸往法國之數量，乃爲法國接受德國經濟統一賠款，及工業水準提高之先決條件，英外相貝文對此斷然加以拒絕，力主德國必須有足够之煤斤供其本國工業之需，俾德國日後得以自給自足。不　需要英美兩國之供給。　使　國外長會議又陷於僵局。　國務卿馬歇爾要求立即討論德國臨時組織，但為蘇外長莫洛托無所反對。</p>
<h3>法蘇歧見未全消除</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿一日電〕法外長皮杜爾今晨在此間法大使館向報界談稱：余日前舉史達林元帥之談話，範圍極廣，精神上亦融洽，惜乎時間太短，未能廓淸全部歧異之點，尤其是雙方對於聯邦的德國之態度，南轅北轍。外傳余將再度與史達林進行會談，但太人尙無此計劃。關於法國要求獲得德國烘斤一事，英法前在談判締結盟約時，商議及此，本有早日獲致協議之希望，但至今雙方意見仍未接近，蓋外相貝文之態度仍與去年十一月間相同，法國對此態度，則余已向法國國民讓會闡明，總之余絕無表示退讓之意。</p>
<h3>美對外救濟金南斯拉夫無份</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日電〕美國務院本日告南斯拉夫謂，擬議中三億五千萬元對外救濟款項將不分配予南斯拉夫，因此批款項將僅撥予最爲需要之各國。</p>
<h3>維護中東遠東安全　英軍隊仍須留駐　亞歷山大向下院表示</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫教二十日電〕國防部長亞歷山大今日在下院爲政府之國防計劃辯護，略謂英國國內國外軍隊，不致大事裁减，徵兵計劃有維特之必要。聯合國構機尙在初期，列强未便解除兵力，今後英國擬不再發表軍隊員額，政府認爲在國際商定自由交換情報政策之前，因製戰前之公開辦法，實屬錯誤。中東仍爲不列顚邦安全重要之一環，吾國在該區之合法需要，務必予以保障。吾人不擬在一九四八年六月底限期前，全部撤退印度方面駐軍。巴勒斯坦問題現已提出聯合國機構討論，在獲得解決以前，英軍當繼續留駐以維治安。亞歷山大繼稱，英國在香港馬來亞等地仍將駐軍，其員額當以其實力足以保障該地之安全與復興爲標準。英軍現駐在日本者爲數有限，英重之在印度尼西亞者均已撒退云。</p>
<h3>英上院通過譴責政府案</h3>
<p>經濟施策指為失當</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二十日電〕英上院今日以一百十九票對卅票，通過譴責工黨政府案，謂其未有適當措施，應付英國之經濟危機也。英上院之投票，與下院同一性質之投票不同，故此項譴責決不致造成推翻艾德禮內閣之後果，僅反映上院中有不滿之反對黨貴族，表示其反工黨之意見而已。此爲本屆議會中，上院之第十次譴責，亦爲最嚴重之一次。</p>
<h3>法閣臨重大危機　賴瑪迪已通知總統物色後繼人　外部派員迎皮杜爾返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：法總統歐禮和頃與各黨領袖作最後一分之努力，以挽救當前政治危機，防止政府頭覆，但除非有出人意料之奇蹟，則其崩潰殆不可免。總理賴瑪迪與各黨領袖會晤後，在社會黨大會中發表演說，謂妥協尙未絕望。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十日電〕法國今又遭遇閣潮新危機，聞賴瑪迪總理已聲明，共黨若不信任政府對越南政策，渠將辭職。共黨領袖杜克洛斯曾宣布該黨將担絕支持對越軍費案，議會處於此種「攤牌」形勢下，乃將此案延至廿二日再行討論。賴瑪油已向歐禮一和總統提出最後通知，依照憲法，總統當物色總理後機人。聞歐禮和急於覓致若干基礎，使四黨言和，以免政府因反共傾向而破裂，此舉或將招致更嚴重之後果，甚至引起總罷工，亦未可知。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿日電〕法總統歐禮和廿日與各政黨領袖會商，以岡覓取一解決政治危機之妥協辦法。晋見歐禮和總統之政黨領袖中有前總理勃魯姆，外間謠傳如賴瑪迪內閣崩潰，勃魯姆或有再度被邀請組織淸一色之社會黨政府可能。共產黨之議會團體今日召開會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿一日電〕法外交部宣佈：已派專員前往莫斯科，以待萬一發生危險時，即可將參加四外長會議之皮杜爾，迅速接回法國。</p>
<h3>社會黨力挽危局　決改變對越政策</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕法國社會黨中央委員會昨日開會，通過決議，主張越南之軍事措施，應以維持治安所必需者爲限，相機與越盟當局代表進行談判，雙方復可實行相互停戰，及任命有志以共和與民主之人爲官員等。按共產黨對越南軍費案拒不投票，致有引起閣潮之處，故社會黨通過該項溫和決議，志在使目前之四黨聯合內閣免於破裂云。</p>
<h3>越盟駐法代表突被逮捕下獄</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十日電〕陸軍部發言人稱：越盟駐巴黎代表團副團長童伯美被捕後，已解軍事當局送巴黎之軍人監獄監禁，並由軍法官訊問數小時之久。</p>
<h3>美蘇之對峙　日本所處地位極關重要</h3>
<p>〔聯合社社紐約廿日電〕國務院人士今日一致認爲麥帥雖述議早日完成對日和約及撤退美軍，但美國防錢已自中國環繞全世界，其中太平洋一段尤關重要，無意加以削弱。代理國務卿艾克遜曾稱由於按術上之原因，對日和約不得不暫緩進行，但實際上尙有其他原因在。蘇聯態度現迫使美國非惟不能放鬆，甚且加緊防綫，此道防，一綫即蘇聯所謂「包圍」，當時乃一不準確名詞，目前則正成爲事實。美蘇在朝鮮，日本，北太平洋及阿拉斯加等地面面相對，最近簽訂之美國與加拿大聯防協定已完成此環，北自格林關，水島一以迄英國，更自德國以迄地中海與義大利。今後數日內之國會行動料將加進希臘，土耳其，與伊朗連結。美國在伊朗久已與蘇聯勢力遭遇，且就某種程度言，曾使之讓步。印度與蘇聯之緩衝國阿富汗雖非一眞正前哨，但美國在該處頗佔勢力，取英國固有地位而代之，以拒蘇聯。此道防綫旣屬政治又屬軍事性質，現下大半屬於政治性質。美國雖應久留日本，保證其民主化，而日本島嶼在軍事上對亞洲大陸之關係與英國對歐陸關係處於同等地位。亞歐二洲一日有激起世界大戰之可能，日本適如英國，即一日不失其對美國國防之重要性。</p>
<h3>美菲軍事情協定　昨正式簽字</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼刺廿一日電〕美菲軍事互助協定，已於廿一日晨八時四十五分在馬尼刺馬賴康能宮中，由羅哈斯與麥克納特代表兩國簽字，其中規定美國派遣軍事使節團軍官五十八名指導菲島之陸海軍，並供給軍事配備，包括船隻八十三艘。該協定每五年修訂一次。</p>
<h3>敎宗兩秘書逝世</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社梵諦岡教廷廿一日電〕羅馬教宗私人秘書奧雪尼觀王，突於今晨逝世，享年七十九歲，距其同事柯降那親王逝世之期，僅隔數日。</p>
<p>美國國立勃　克哈文實騐室。該實騐室係東部九著名大學所合辦，由政府斥資，專事研究原子能之和平用途。（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>
<h3>美主早日會商　對日和約草案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕據政府方面本日消息，國務院擬於短期內與其他各國會商對日和約之起草事宜。政府方面否認此項決定係因麥帥最近發表聲明所致，但指出駐日盟國警制委員會主席文其森於最近返美期間，當局曾吿以此項決定，大槪艾氏已將此項決定轉吿麥帥，故麥帥即發表聲明。現問題所在厥在何等國家可參加和約之起草工作，及何等國家有審核之權利。美國若十官員雖希望遠東管制委員會之十一國家均當參加封日和約之起草工作，但蘇聯必將加以反對。一般認爲對日和約殆將仿歐洲和約之前例，僅由四五主要國家担任和約之起草工作，而由遠東管制委員會之其餘國家審核之。此間官方並認爲在正式開始討論之後，對日和約工作之完成將爲期九個月至十二個月之久云。</p>
<h3>安理會開會討論　柯孚海峽觸雷案　兩集團對峙法守中立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿一日廣播：聯合國安理會今日恢復討論柯孚海峽觸雷案時，阿爾巴尼亞代表卡波重申阿政府不承認預知水雷存在之意。據悉，各國代表對此問題意見紛歧，美國等五國代表進備支持英國之指控，即阿爾巴尼亞政府故意埋置非法水雷，炸毀英驅逐艦二艘，炸斃水兵四十四人。法國與叙利亞保持中立，或將棄權。蘇聯與波蘭則支持阿爾巴尼亞，指英國之控訴不能提出證據。英國預料蘇聯將否決安理會之任何起訴，故建議將本案移付國際法庭處理。</p>
<h3>西各黨籌商復辟　礦區遊擊隊頗呈活躍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社里期本二十日電〕據此間本日獲悉：西班牙之保王黨保守黨及天主教黨，頃在埃斯托里爾舉行重要會議多次。前國王之十唐璜亦參加會議。該會議決與流亡共和政府討論復辟之事。會議之建議及決議案將不致予以公佈，但將分別送西班牙境內之保王黨及天主教黨幷强調在重建帝制及設立爲外國所承認之政府時，應有意見一致之必要。唐璜決在舉行公民投票之後恢復帝制，根據自由憲法之規定，與自由選出之國會取得合作，以統治西班牙。</p>

<h3>上淞綫輪渡加價　浦東居民請糾正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕浦東金家橋鎭居民周默等頃向市參議會呈訴，上淞綫輪渡變相加價，請求速予糾正。其理由略謂：上淞綫輪渡自上海至慶寗寺計票價原為二等五百元，頭等一千元，特等一千五百元。但於二月廿六日起，突隨票價附徵燃料附加費百分之十，此舉顯與二月十七日政府公佈之經濟緊急指施方案不合，居住浦東職工，深受影響，故請速轉市府飭令糾正。</p>

<h3>中航鄂西墮機案　地檢處不予起訴　各方調查認定非人力所能挽救</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」中國航空公司Ｃ四六式一四五號滬渝綫客機於本年一月二十八日在鄂西天門縣境失事後，謠傳其失事原因係機中某重要部份機件之螺絲釘被人拔去，或云機翼中夾帶黃金二百條，使飛行時失去平衡而致失事。本市地院以該機在本市起飛，如有上述犯罪行為，應受本市法院管轄，曾指派地檢處劉用之檢察官負責偵查。劉檢察官認為中航公司機航組主任吳士（美籍）及副主任陳鴻思·王助等三人旣職掌機航事宜之指揮督察，對於每次飛機飛行前機件及人員之總檢查，以及途中發生障碍情報之核示機宜均負相當責任，如飛機失事，查有職務上之過失時，機航主任應負刑事責任，故檢察官曾對吳士·陳鴻思·王助三人加以偵訊。據吳士稱：該機起飛前經嚴密之複查，並未發現「重要機件之螺絲釘被拔去」，機翼中除油箱外亦無金條，並特別强調縱使機內載有七十公斤黃金亦不致使飛機失去平衡，即使飛機失去平衡亦不致失事。並據該公司漢口方面調查報吿，該機自上海往漢口及漢口起飛時機件係屬正常，氣候良好。又據專家調查報吿，該機失事原因係左面機器起火，左翼燒去，機師不及降落，而致墮毀。此種失事情尤非人力所能挽救，亦不能預見，其不可避免，殆鉀疑問。故吳等士三人，其主管職務自無過失可言。除監督失當部份另作行政程序教濟外，要難遽擬過失致死之刑責，乃依刑事訴訟法第二百三十一條第十款予以不起訴處分。</p>

<h3>周更生瘐斃案高院傳訊證人　怪字條來源仍未獲要領</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕漢奸嫌疑犯周更生，即周庚生，又名周奎，三十五歲，江蘇如阜人，瘐斃高院看守所後，衣袋中發現「怪字條」，有人勒索三十五根金條，高院對此極為注意。昨日下午提訊同案在押之被吿闞春陽，任天福，並傳訊證人鐵路公會代表朱金邦，張樹椿，周父周鴻業，同囚室之林憶志等，到庭作證。</p>
<p>綜合證人陳述，該案之北景為爭奪承包滬杭路日暉港車站全部裝卸工作，因此項包工，收入甚豐，故不惜以全力爭逐。綠戰前沃福林為承包人，於戰事發生時，日機轟炸日暉港車站甚烈，沃懼而逃，嗣即由周更生·　春陽·任天福等承包，從事於當時之軍運工作，曾得鐵道運輸司令部褒獎。勝利後沃福林仍擬承包，曾發動檢舉</p>
<p>發動檢舉</p>
<p>，於去年八月前，有一名冊　兩路局運務處。其中即係指陳周更生等有漢奸嫌疑。本案吿訴人雖為全長生，全森林，面策動者則為沃福林。至於周父周鴻業，對「怪字條」一事，似不　運大，昨到庭稱：「自兒子周更生死後，於悲憤之下，將他生前寫的條子統統燒了」。雖經邱推事嚴誥，均避免作</p>
<p>正面答復</p>
<p>。同囚室之林憶志稱：周是蘇北人，我是杭州人，因語言各異，而且他又生病，雖同一房間，我們從來沒有談過話。訊問至此，對「怪字條」之來源，仍不得要領。為明瞭此案情形起見，記者曾走訪高院看守所負責人，承吿情形如次。周更生患心臟病甚久，本所曾請監獄醫院醫師為其治療，因心臟病未能移入病房，送於十九日晨四時許死於因室中。當時各樓因犯　喧，</p>
<p>秩序大亂</p>
<p>，嗣經挫出代表十六人，向陳所長提出改善待遇等要求，所有周更生死後遺下之信件字條，均由犯人粘呈陳所長，故此「條字條」之來源，未敢臆測。為維持監獄紀律起見，前日曾停止開封一日，昨日起仍照常開封。關於病重時准否交保事，不在本所權力範圍之內，故外間對本所之種種猜測，自有事實證明，不願有所申辦。</p>
<p>復與島案開審右起王奎，金振聲，王頌謙，李雲鵬（本報攝）</p>
<h3>復興島盜買物資案初審　四被告矢口否認　庭論改期再審傳牛春齡對質</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕復興島疑案盜賣敵軍遺留物資部份，被吿李雲鵬，王頌謙，金振聲，王奎等四人，經檢察官提起公訴地院昨晨首次開審。除被吿四人外，另傳證人王千里，韓勝榮，王恩慶，胡根華到庭作證。據第一被吿行總漁管處事務課長李雲鵬供稱：王頌謙，金振聲，王奎均非我介紹，當時島上係由海軍牛春齡排長担任警衛等工作。至於牛有否盜賣島上物資，本人無法知悉。島上日軍遺留物資雖多，但非主管，無法得悉詳情，更無法取得。牛春齡被拘後，並未前往探視。（按據檢察官起訴書稱，李已供認曾往探視），更未致送金條等情。浴缸兩隻係工人王奎修水管時發現，其中僅有糞土而未見黃金。餘三被吿亦皆否認有勾串盜賣物資等罪行。庭上轉詢證人王千里，王係行總農委會專門委員及技術室主任，亦係疑案中被吿之一，檢察官認為有誣告罪嫌，但因大赦，宣吿不起訴處分，據王稱：本案被吿四人，皆係由彼介紹，李雲鵬與彼係十五年老友，故此案非其吿發甚明。撿察官以為其不能任漁管處處長，因而企圖搗亂，實出於誤會。因技術室主任之地位，與處長實相差無幾，或係檢察官誤聽漁管處處長許復七之含有傾軋作用言詞。並保證李雲鵬廉潔無貪汚行為。另一證人韓勝榮稱，業漆匠，與徐光材相識。彼之購買鉛皮，係由徐介紹向馬際良所買，並不知該項鉛皮係復興島被盜臟物。與牛春齡亦素不相識。庭上諭稱：本案須向海軍軍法處傳牛春齡到案對質，諭改限再審。被吿李雲鵬等四人，除交原保外，另各交五千萬元書面保。</p>

<h3>「四大名山」　賊黨審結　劉航俠供迫於生計　劉懷德不認是同犯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「四大名由」賊黨劉航俠，劉懷德，張志淸自經地檢處提起公訴後，昨晨首次開審。據劉航俠供稱：曾任航委會文書，失業後迫於生活行竊，先後犯案六次·劉懷德供稱：與劉航俠一度同事，曾在十四軍政治部任職，又曾入靑年劇社演戲，與後方來滬之藝人頗多熟悉，在宜昌遇劉航俠，同來上海謀業，合居於惠中旅館，初尙不知劉航俠偷竊為生。並謂：從未曾參加行竊。劉航俠並向庭上懇求，姑念其年靑，從輕量刑，給以自新機會。朱育璜推事訊畢，諭審理終結，定二十八日上午宣判。被吿張志淸部份，因該犯係屬啞吧，不能普通審訊，改期另審。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>（一）胸部隱痛</p>
<p>王明問　敝人於三四月前經Ｘ光檢查，醫師云肺部良好，惟左肺上部有老疤，宜注意休養，茲有疑問二點：請指示（一）敝人從未患肺病，何以肺上有疤？肺結核之初期活動，與老疤，在照Ｘ光時，有無顯著分別？（二）胸部時時作痛，是否與此疤有關？（三）因工作關係，無法休養，宜服用何種有效藥物，魚肝油丸有益否？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士顧毓琦答〕根據來信所述，最好拍一Ｘ光照片，因螢光透視尙難確切診斷，茍Ｘ光照片斷定無活動性結核，則該胸部時作隱痛係肋骨神經痛。多種維太命丸可常服。</p>
<p>（二）產後多病</p>
<p>何企人問　鄙戚現年十七歲，女性，已婚，身體甚健。不意今年六月分娩時難產，胎兒悶死肚中，後以手術將孩取出，方得脫險，但子宮因而潰爛，小便亦不能約束，淋漓無度，並有陰吹現象，痛苦萬狀，不知是何病症，請賜答覆。</p>
<p>〔醫學博士顧毓琦答〕令親之病，須詳細檢騐後方可決定治療方針，恐須動用手術。</p>

<h3>復員後之清華（中）</h3>
<p>— 梅貽琦</p>
<p>農學院去秋成立，校園內難覓適當房舍，幸得敎部撥給敵偽建立之土木專科學校校舍（在頤和園東）加以修理，暫可敷用。</p>
<p>學生宿舍，新，平，善，明四齋，共有五百六十八間，原來設計，每間住二人，事實亦以住二人為合適，茲因學生增多，改住三人，共容納一千七百八十餘人，原為工友預備者，亦經住入，擁擠情形，住過此項宿舍之校友，可以想像。女生宿舍之靜齋，共有六十八房間，每間原住二人，現亦改住三人，共住二百人。其以上齋舍不能容納者，男生尚有五十餘人現暫住在一院樓下，女生亦有四十人，住在古月堂，宿舍內設備，除鐵床幾經交涉，幸得保留外，其他傢俱均須新製。先修班學生二百人暫住在農學院。學生宿舍之問題，至今秋將更為嚴重，因倘如去秋情形，再收錄新生一千左右，而今夏畢業者祗有二百餘人，則此增多之六七百人，如何安置，在工料高貴之今日，添建宿舍，將不可能，則惟有就現有房間估計容登對增加人數而加以限額錄取耳。</p>
<p>敎職員宿舍，原有之學務處（工字廳）前部，怡春院，均經大加修葺，仍作單身敎職員宿舍之用。此外在體育館後面，敵人建有平房卅六間，迤遞逼近氣象台，俗呼為卅六所者，暫仍保留其大部房間，亦供作單身敎職員宿舍之用。至於敎職員住宅，舊有之三所，北院，西院，新舊南院，經修理改造之後，可住一百四十餘家，另於小河之南，加建小房四十所（名勝因村），但仍不敷分配，蓋因近來本校院系擴充，學生加多，敎職員人數亦須相富坍加，且本校僻處郊外，延聘敎師，如有眷屬者，不能不供給其住宅，若使往返城郊，不僅影響敎學，且額外消耗，對其菲薄之收入，將更不能維持，此住宅問題，本校獨感困難者也。</p>
<p>清華園戶外景像，驟觀如舊，但各區道路，猶待修整，敵人遺棄之灰堆煤屑，尚在淸除。所最幸者，全校樹木，竟未遭敵人砍伐，但年久失修，有枯死者，有叢生過密者，亦須檢查修整，則俟天氣稍暖，即當進行。冀於初春花發之際，園林整潔，溪池淸澈，一復水木淸華之舊觀，我校友於時重返校園，第一印象，將有風景無殊之感，然而內在之創痕，固深且鉅，則非以數年之人力財力不易恢復矣。</p>

<h3>華股市況蕭颯　行後跌風更厲</h3>
<p>華股昨似呈游資退出之象，疲莫能興。午後有借款成功之訊，更得代用品保證二成改征現金之謠，賣風被激大盛，竟呈潰散之局。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>雖尚顧穩，惟存多急於了結，開後即遭一〇五號一三三號二二三號九七號一八五號八五號八九號供售，遞永紗自二七五〇元步降至二六四〇元。一〇六號一九九號一七七號趁低維持，升為二六八〇元。八九號一六號三二號一八五號賣到二六三元，一四號一四一號一七八號二三五號九四號有納，乃升至二六九〇元。一八一號一八五號一五四號一九八號一三號四號二二三號八九號咸售，十時半，跌落至二五九〇元。三六號一三號一五二號一九八號一七七號七六號一九九號一七二號三二號一一七號連袂買進，逐漸回漲，十一時半，曾漲到二七一〇元左右。二四號二二四號二三一號七六號五六號二二〇號一五五號一四一號尚具賣胃。午收回挫至二六五〇元左右。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞華豐景福勤興微降，新光中法新華稍升。遞父永紗信和美亞微降，華豐跌半成弱，新光微漲，冷股永泥升一成不到，景綸麗安微升，內衣國貨商務平平，大通永公跌半成左右，餘者微挫。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>夜報有借款六億元成功之訊，加之靈通方面又傳二成代用品有改征現金之謠，賣風大起，二三二號二二四號二二號二四號二三五號三六號一五五號六五號一六九號二〇號爭售，遞永紗退至二四二〇元。一三七號二三四號八九號尚納，升為二四七〇元。美亞由一五六號賣到跌停，嗣遞美亞以及新亞勸興大通遞信和次第跌停，人心更虛。一九七號一五六號七六號一三號一九九號九七號一五三號二〇七號四號四七號再賣到二四〇〇元。一八五號二二三號進至二四七〇元。四七號九七號二〇七號八三號二〇號三六號二一八號五七號二二四號一二五號一再供售，臨收時退至二三五〇元，而後稍穩。結果較前收計永紗美亞跌一成，信和華豐新光景福勤興新華各跌一成半不到，中法亦然，其中勤興美亞中法均曾迫停，遞交永紗信和華豐新光各跌成半弱，美亞跌停，冷股大通永公跌停後略回，新亞停板，榮豐中紡統益商務水泥內衣各跌一成，餘亦跌半成强。塲外各股大生三廠再跌，餘尚平定。</p>
<h3>實力派吸納　統債又盤高</h3>
<p>公債昨一般實力派繼續吸納，雖有多方供給，但仍在盤高，交易更為熱鬧，十二時後，尚在開做。統丙晨開一三五〇〇元，曾低至一二一〇〇元，再回漲至一四二〇〇元，而後盤旋，結果較前收計甲乙升四百元，統丙漲九百元，丁升二百元，戊亦升六百元，成交約二千萬元。</p>
<h3>外股仍疲</h3>
<p>外股昨業中人仍在出籠，證券帮中亦供過於求，各股除紙業怡啤有發息之訊，洋商吸納，尚見平穩外，餘者咸告不支，怡紗自一七一〇〇元起，盤低至一五九〇〇元而後微平。結果較前收計怡紗英聯航業各跌半成强，紙業稍漲，餘均微降。</p>
<h3>染料疲極轉秀　水靛銷路活躍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一憊再疲工染料市况，近日已呈轉好，各貨價格亦躍漲。水靛銷路活躍，客銷亦略鴨鬧，市銷以貶價至相當程度後不無進吸。昨市六九三硫化元每担六百四十萬元，ＭＫ硫化元每担四百五十萬元，ＢＮＣ元靑每斤九十萬元，地字灰每斤卅五萬元，頓位水靛廿五斤裝每聽一百九十萬元，牛頭水靛百市斤裝每聽一百八十五萬元，成交甚多。</p>
<h3>細布價均回降</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因紡建公司前日供售之十二磅紅龍頭細布額子不多，同業吸收拉抬，照掛牌加三四千元有吃進。故十二磅龍頭細布曾悄至十五萬七千餘元，迨至收盤，本客兩帮實需不暢，染廠觀望，結果終比上日回小二千五百元，為十五萬五千元。藍鷄藍鳳五福陽鶴彩球等牌，亦均回降，自一千元至三四千元。士林布客帮辦胃見懈，一九〇美亭林亦小七千元，其餘漂布色布嗶嘰等布價，亦跌過於漲。</p>
<h3>對於本年度茶貸　茶商表示五項意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪某茶業鉅子，詢以對本年度政府舉辦茶貸之意見，渠表示五點：（一）擬蓋政府預先確定本年度茶葉外銷後，所可能獲取最大限度之外匯。渠稱：去年度茶葉外銷結果，僅獲外匯美金五百萬元。癥結所在，與舉辦貸款太緩有關。故本年度如欲多獲取外匯，茶貸須大額舉辦，手績須力求迅速。茶商方面，估計本年度茶葉，如能按計劃外銷，可得外匯美金一千五百萬元至二千萬元。（二）望能以最低可能限度之利率，發放茶貸。渠稱：以台灣言，貸款僅年息六厘。（三）為防止偷工减料起見，希望茶葉品質，應提高至最高限度之標準。（四）現因勞工太貴，為减低成本起見，望在可能範圍之內，逐步達到茶業機械化之月的。（五）為配合各種農貸起見，望能普遍提倡茶農生產合作社。將來茶業可以透過合作社，奠定現代化之基礎。惟此需長時期之敎育，及宗敎性之提倡。渠最後表示：去年交通中國農民等銀行舉辦茶貸，業務過度集中上海一隅。本年度起，似應加强各地區分支行處力量，俾能與茶商密切聯係，獲取最大效果云。</p>
<h3>茶市情況閒散</h3>
<p>狹隘多時之茶葉內銷，依然未見振作，但執貨者人心尚不露傖慌之狀，是以情况雖靜，而絕鮮下墜景象。至於洋莊茶市，繼承連日之軟風，加以一般急需銀根用者，賡續吐售，進購者趁機再欺，以致趨勢迄未好轉，價絡方面，均猶衰弱。且查成交數量，反不若往者之活躍，萱目前賣戶對於售價前途，復再者小，以故不顧多取，僅擇需要者稍加沾染而已。</p>
<h3>重貼現轉抵押　國行決擴大範圍　扶助生產事業及出口商</h3>
<p>中央銀行為扶持中小型生產事業，及出口商起見，去年曾策動商業行莊，組織工商貸款銀團，向該行辦理轉抵押，重貼現。此項貸款，迄至目前為止，共貸出九十九億餘元，中央銀行均一一按照原放款額七五折，辦理轉抵押，重貼現。據悉：該行為配合經濟緊急措施方案，重貼現及轉抵押辦法，決加强推行，範圍並將擴大，貸款對象，不限於中小型工廠，大規模之廠家，亦可獲得重貼現及轉抵押之權利。凡國內有工廠城市，及出口物資集中地區，均辦重貼現及轉抵押，以作各商業行莊之最後借貸者，盡其銀行之銀行之責任。</p>
<h3>三月份收紗價格　行政院已經通過　每件三一五萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕確悉：行政院頃已通過紡管會三月份收購棉紗之價格。計二十支標準紗，每件為三百十五萬元。又二月份之收購棉紗價，二十支紗亦經調整為每件二百七十五萬元，（原定收購價為二百五十萬元）。其他各支棉紗之收購價，則由紡管會按該會一月份所訂定之推算比例計算之。</p>
<p>民營各紗廠自由買賣之廠盤議價，二十支標準紗，每件亦經通過為三百七十萬元。</p>
<h3>秈米去胃見爽</h3>
<p>昨日南北共到米糧八千石左右，粳米市况依然平衡，暫無呼吸，惟南粳早薄稻貨稀消活，略見緊俏，秈米店胃甚爽，盤漲千元。白元平正，險元相仿。</p>
<p>油市靑島來電告漲，兼之廣帮甬帮均有納實，轉成活跳。生豆油均見回昂入九千元，淸油亦加入九千元，蔴油帶挺一二千元，菜油堅定。</p>
<p>豆餅客消依然閒散，市形站平，麵粉供求尚穩，洋本粉均鮮變動，惟下等粉因醬園動辦，挺升千餘元。</p>
<p>黃豆來去兩平，大豆杜豆仍少榮辱，惟乍豆去胃甚暢，盤漲千元。菉豆平疲之格，缸豆則汕頭收吸頗力，步砌一二千元。紅糧不振，再低千元。蠶豆呆平之局，小麥相仿。芝蔴洋莊蟬聯，價格堅挺。生仁南洋搜購，冉冉上升，續漲三五千元。</p>
<h3>進出口貿易辦法　增加丁項條文</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入管理會執委會昨日發衷第十號公告，略稱：茲於修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，增加丁項，文曰：（丁）各國駐華使領館，及其外交人員，因公務或私人所需輸入附表（三）乙及附表（四）所列貨品，須經該國駐華大使（或公使）證明後，送由輸入臨時管理委員會，核發輸入許可證。</p>
<h3>日本藥商死灰復燃　製藥業前途堪慮　當局應從速謀挽救之道</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市新藥業方面傳來消息：日本製藥工業，已自戰火灰燼中，整理就緒，近有向我國市塲競爭營業之準備。記者為此訪問製藥工業公會理事長顧克民氏，詢其實際情形。據稱：所傳確實，我國製藥工業前途，將從此益增困難。戰前日產藥品，本已泛濫市塲，吾人所受影響，至為深重。淪陷期中，日商挾其軍事奧援，營業呈獨佔狀態，迨勝利來臨，競爭形勢，雖一掃而盡，但因政局不安，經濟政策脫節，藥廠基礎搖搖欲墜。所幸貸款實現，得度年關。最近政府採取保護政策，禁止西藥進口，本可望其昭蘇。無如製藥原料同列禁例，且外匯無額，購料無從，致積弱之製藥業，復陷於困難之境，國計民生極堪祀憂。深望輸管當局盡量扶掖，俾此國防工業，繼續不墜。日產藥品，原為多年勁敵，近據新藥業方面相告，日方最大藥廠，如　義野株式會社，已遍發商用信件，請求我國藥商恢復往來。預料我奄奄一息之樂廠，將更受其競爭之影響。至望輸入管理委員會注視是項形勢，從速改善購料辦法，從根本上挽救此一垂危之國防工業。</p>
<h3>雲南企業公司　股東遍及全省</h3>
<p>雲南企業公司，為前滇省主席龍雲首創，頃奉省府命令，於本年五月一日召開股東代表大會，凡本省人民皆為股東，每人出資金五千元，股東代表為每鄉鎭一人，再由鄉鎭代表中推選一縣代表，赴省參加股東大會。</p>
<h3>烟煤市勢鬆軟</h3>
<p>煤商近因忙於請願及分配派貨，經濟與人事均受牽制，故市塲交易極為閑散。此次烟煤派貨數量雖微，然市勢為之漸轉鬆濫，市價續呈疲軟。白煤同得利小子等亦然，僅焦作塊最近因供貨較少，市價重出一百四十萬關。</p>
<h3>白糖又見緊俏</h3>
<p>昨自糖市價復趨緊俏，而納胃較旺。靑糖則反見顧軟，台赤又升五六千元。公會劃盤，現貨二二中砂白二十一萬七千五百元至八千元好起四千元，秘魯細砂即日交割二十萬元，今日期二十萬零七千元至二十一萬元，下週一二十萬零三四五六千元。下午二十一萬一千元，下週二廿一萬二千元，升度近萬元。台赤十四萬九千元，十五萬元，十四萬八七千元，下午升至十五萬三四千元。二四粗白升萬餘元，四半車它上落較微，三半又升萬元之譜。其餘土糖反見稍鬆，如提靑為十三萬元，順德靑十二萬七千元至五千元，刁靑十二萬三千元至二千五百元，成交四五百包。</p>
<h3>桐油腸衣價高　出口前途黯淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕桐油以市價超越外價，故各地雖有到貨，成本不符，尚難出口。腸衣紐約做出價折合國幣每桶為六百五十六萬七千元，滬市收價須七百萬元，且僅足以敷成本，出口前途，均頗黯淡。</p>
<h3>柴油配貨多</h3>
<p>據悉柴油市價，最近已趨呆滯，聞自此次匯率調整後，外商德士古·美孚·亞細亞等三公司曾繼續大量拋售，同時因中石公司油配給已奉令結束，新機構尚未成立，按過去油配會規定，三公司進口油類量，均須事先呈報該會，並指定限售廠商，經售商向在禁售之例，惟目前暫無控制機構，故三公司已可自由售予經售商，而中石公司營業所現仍繼續配售柴油，致供求平衡，市價與配價幾形相等。</p>
<h3>棉花廠銷健旺</h3>
<p>昨日棉花廠胃特健，同業交易亦夥。永安紗廠進米特林１/８一百包，價為九十九萬元。申新一廠進米特林15/16一百包，價做七十八萬元，又進老河花一百六十七件。申新六廠亦進南太倉皮花二百担，價四十萬元。同業成交三餘細絨，及通州粗絨，浦東火機，南太倉皮花，各一百包，故其市氣頗堅。</p>
<h3>川臘產地報漲　市價反頻下降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕川臘近日銷路轉稀，雖香汎已近，燭淘需要增多，但以川臘價值甚大，類多年底即已進足。據業中人云：川臘上年產量平平，漢口，重慶，產地頻頻上漲，漢口每担價為五百萬元，重慶價為四百五十萬元，本市昨米心大餅每市担由四百萬降至三百六十萬元，牙口中餅每担三百五十五萬元。</p>
<h3>桂圓荔枝轉緊</h3>
<p>桂圓荔枝自回降以來，市價已在背馳之列，故一部客貨正在保守中。昨市漸見轉機，雜路大粒桂圓開升四五萬元，上檔元肉亦升二三萬元，金山元枝開四十二萬八千元，扁枝六十四萬八千元，糯米枝一百七十二萬元。</p>
<h3>紡建售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗，共售二〇〇六件，內廠商一五八四件，紗號四二二件。申請共一二〇一戶，內廠商八〇四戶，紗號三九七戶。</p>
<h3>東北大豆外銷　由中信局管制</h3>
<p>關於東北大豆外運，前東北行　經濟委員會鑑於大豆以客商買賣期貨，致將價格激起，數日間增達一兩倍，該會深感大豆漲價，刺激其他食糧價格，特規定由中信局統賣，並限制其價格，然後運銷海外，套取外匯，其利益分配為十分之一為中信局利益，十分之九歸經委會存歸國庫後，並特將大豆規定為特種品，一般客商若須外運，必須經濟委員會外銷大豆檢驗所檢驗認為合於標準後，始准出口，至於貨物由關內運來，東北當局概不加予限制。</p>
<h3>債市陰影</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來聞有若干證券字號之對敲交易，已自股票轉延至公債。據某關係當局談稱：債市發現對敲交易，實屬不當。債市之狂跳，純屬人為操縱結果。渠指出：本市公債交易，頗具欺騙陰謀性質，緣留滬統債，戰時以無法至後方取息，故至第十二期之息票，迄未領取，現債市交易，對在渝業已領息之統債，拒絕收受。無形中减少統價流通籌碼；並鼓吹統丙將叩某關，以遂其抬價及欺騙散戶之目的。更怪者，即業已中籤之紅券，竟亦在市高價買賣云。</p>
<h3>英商公共汽車　公司宣告清算</h3>
<p>前英商公共汽車公司，因於敵人佔領時，將其所有車輛零件設備等全數徵用，勝利後經敵產處理局認定發還者僅十餘輛，且大都已破壞不堪，無法使用，且其行駛之各路綫，公用局已大部派車行駛，故於昨日（廿一）正式宣告自動解散淸算，設淸算處於外灘一號六〇五室，凡權利及債權人，可於四月十五日前往登記淸算，逾期作棄權論云。</p>
<h3>卡車一批到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天祥洋行船務部經理之英輪奧根雪特號，前日自喀兒各搭來滬，運來大號卡車二百六十餘輛，客車五十餘輛。該項車輛係留於印度之剩餘物資，由救濟總署報運。又仲愷輪前日南駛，載豆子一千七百七十餘包，豆餅四萬一千餘塊，運往汕頭。</p>
<h3>澳門黃金　準進不準出？</h3>
<p>據金融界權威人士稱，此間當局，濫發黃金進口證，以致到香港之外國黃金，均運至澳門。經記者詢問漢門經濟局局長稱：澳門自去年十一月准許黃金進口，但出口則在禁止之列，轉口亦須特別申請允許證，並以留半數存澳門為條件。目前已發出由港運至印度孟買轉口允許證，約合黃金六十萬兩；準予轉口至中國國境之允許證，則從未發過。</p>
<h3>工業油臘實銷清淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕小呂宋椰子油存底已枯，進口絕跡，第以皂廠皂銷亦弱，實銷因之不振，市價仍逗阻於每擔四十三萬元，較之上年每擔卅八萬元，不相上下。蚌埠牛油到貨亦少，價為每担四十萬元。本淘牛油每日產量為二百担左右，近亦轉稀，市價與蚌埠相彷。柏油到貨甚缺，因產地價格，旣駢高於滬市，如加運川，成高出滬市現價，故來濟稀少，實銷亦淡，價無軒輊。</p>

<h3>延安光復後　追記馬欄戰役</h3>
<p>— 三月十日陝北宜川訊　本報駐陝記者　黎青</p>
<p>胡宗南精銳部隊第一師，以雷霾萬鉤之巨大力量於十九日晨直入賀龍部企圖扼守之延安城，馬不停蹄，即分兵兩路　績挺進，以截斷竄逃中之共軍退路，並肅淸其殘餘部隊。</p>
<p>延安為共黨之老巢，亦為共軍之司令塔，與兵進犯，已非一日，記者在此追記馬欄之役，亦自有其鑑往知來之意，存乎其間，幸母以明日黃花視之。</p>
<p>攻勢幻滅</p>
<p>去歲歲薯，延安共軍一度攻陷陜北宜君縣屬西南隅之馬欄鎭，當時新華社與駐南京之中共發言人屢發「戰報」，備加誇張。今歲以還，共軍由此號稱「關中區專員公署」所在地之「馬欄市」，突破碉堡綫，紛紛調兵南犯，直達涇河北岸，一面盡力擴寬缺口而形成囊形地帶，包括栒邑·淳化·銅川·續縣·三原等縣之一部或一大部。其最高潮，為去月上旬攻陷東南距浮化縣城僅十公座之通　　，惟縣絨始終在國軍手。　　後獲得共軍文件所載，當日所謂「淳化攻勢」，其目的，在乎東攻三原。運　，再進一步以威脅長安之北背。然此妄圖，　告幻滅：不特通潤　·柳林鎭·馬攔鎭。國軍相繼收復，長安之威脅消除，徑河北之囊形陣地解決，而殘存之共軍，亦不得不向北潰退百餘公里，至宜君縣北境之沮水流城，與黃陵（中部），鄜縣間。</p>
<p>袋形陣地</p>
<p>欲明瞭馬　之重要性，請先述陝甘甯邊區與國軍間之境界綫。延安控制地區之屬於甘肅省境者，在去月底為環縣。縫陽·合水三縣，（按：慶陽·合水兩縣本月初國軍收復）而國軍之防守綫則略與鎭原·甯縣·正甯三縣間之東西向公路統平行；再往東，則折南而入陝境之拘邑。陝北之交界綫則東起自延長。宜川兩縣間之汾川河南岸以南附近，由此起點迤向西甫越洛河而達鄂縣；再往西，亦折南而入黃陵。宜君兩縣之一角。上述所謂「袋形陣地」者，即係以甘肅之正甯與陝北之宜君兩縣間之缺口作為「袋口」，迤南發展成為囊形，而馬欄鎭則位於「袋口」之正中。該鎭人口不及三四千，實毫無經濟的價值，延安美其名日「市」，毋甯强調其軍事性。</p>
<p>戰將撤職</p>
<p>共軍在此地區作戰者，番號旣多，實力亦相當，先後被發現者，計有警備一旅一團，警備二旅，警備三旅二團，警備七旅等等，此外聞尚有一股砲兵，統歸著名之胡量　負責指揮。（胡尚有兄弟數人，亦充共軍高級軍事幹部）彼曾分東西南三路招架，然國軍之出擊則在馬欄之北，藉以封鎖袋口，使袋形中之共軍，盡成「囊中物」。果爾，胡某今以戰敗責任問題，被撤職他調，接任者為楊虎城之子楊拯民，由此番人事更迭，當知延安對此地區今後之重要性，尚有加無减。</p>
<p>戰火之後</p>
<p>駡欄先後飽經兩次戰火，其慘酷程度，非親履其地者，不能測及萬分之一。共軍潰退時，老百姓之食糧，衣被，以及馬，牛，羊，鷄，犬，豕，等牲畜，無不被迫北運。拆屋毀家，不在話下，小至如猪窩，犬棚，馬槽，甚至鍋，碗，篠，杓亦蕩然無存！百姓何辜，遭此浩刦！</p>
<p>馬欄東南數十公里楊家店與柳林鎭，亦一度被共軍洗刦，潰退後，百姓有歌謠一首流行，茲一字不易，記述如左：</p>
<p>民間歌謠</p>
<p>「八路軍，　魚子，佔了邊區各村子。楊家店，柳林子。翻箱子，倒櫃子，舖襯套子，綫穗子。盆盆子，　　子，大小袱包担担子。簪子鐲子耳環子，褥子被子門窗子。娃籍子。尿布子，破破衫子爛褲子。辣麵子，靈確子，大小不留一件子。燒子房子草墩子，搶下東西綁獸子。　踢年靑　婦子，打死懷裏月娃子。割耳朵，割鼻子，拉去獸驟毛驢子。打着我的大兒子，給他背着麵袋子。縛的百姓一串子，跟着碎娃一鏈子。鰲魚八路外圍子，趕着百娃爬山子。」</p>
<p>嗚呼！阿鼻地獄，諒亦不過如此而已。馬欄之役解決於先，甘省之合水，慶陽，收復於後，陝甘甯邊區之南面界綫，刻已澈底變更。今日之缺口，似已北移至甘肅之合水與陝北之　縣。今後之變化，當為我們矚目之一點。海軍耆宿薩鎭冰氏</p>
<h3>竹園　訪薩鎭冰　海軍耆宿一席談</h3>
<p>— 福州十三日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>「薩菩薩」是福州人送給海軍耆宿薩鎭冰上將的雅號，薩上將也的確受之無愧。薩氏為人慈祥愷悌，和和可親，一生以行善為職志，閩中雖三尺稚童，亦莫不知薩上將之為人。論事業，薩氏與一部中國海軍史有不可分之關係。上將高齡八十有九，是人瑞，也是一代英豪。</p>
<p>踏上倉前山直詣上將府</p>
<p>是一個晴朗的早晨，記者驅車直奔南台，踏上倉前山，此處是福州的「世外桃源」，洋房幢幢，風景佳麗。往昔，西僑及領事館皆聚居於此，是洋人的住宅區，環境相當洋化，倉前山有跑馬廳一所，比上海跑馬薩面積還要大，是洋人的跑馬遊息之地，掛牌不准中國人進去，倉前山儼如福州的公共租界。抗戰後，西僑大半返國，福州的「寓公」們，相繼闢居於此。</p>
<p>在跑馬廳附近，有一所西式洋房，有如上海弄堂裏的公寓，外書「竹園」，號稱肅威上將軍的薩鎭冰氏即是寓居於此。經侍者之通報，記者與上將在其樓上寢室中會見，上將微笑相迎，記者關心他老人家的生活，首詢他近來的健康狀况，氏表示年事邁老，五官性能衰退，尤其是去年患了血管硬化症，常有氣喘，極少外出，日常生活由其家屬及侍者服侍，生活費則由中央發給，對於外界的各種變遷，亦少於聞問</p>

<p>記者詢及將軍對於往事之感想，氏表示自十餘歲從軍，歷四十餘載之戎行，人事滄桑，不無感慨。氏為淸廷派遣留英第一屆之學生，專習海軍。回國後，歷任水師遊擊參將，參與甲申中法之役，賞加總兵銜，帮統北洋海軍，為常時水師提督葉祖珪所賞識，後為葉保舉為廣東水師軍門提督，統率南北洋海軍，光緒末奉派出國考察各國海軍之建制，心得頗多，後升海軍大臣。迨至武昌起義時，氏被派與當時陸軍大臣蔭昌分統海陸軍南下戡亂，薩氏深受革命主義之燻陶與國父精神之感召，乃率部通電反正，於辛亥革命貢獻甚大。民國肇始，歷任海軍部總長，風務總、理，榮號肅威上將軍。民國十三年，福建政局變動，氏以民望所歸，兼攝省長，在任數載，以民為重，忠勤政事，極得地方人士之擁護及中央當局之讚許，今日以登入九高齡，雖早脫軍旅生涯，然仍被聘為海軍總司令部高級顧問。</p>
<p>南北有良港國防重海軍</p>
<p>記者叩詢上將對於建設中國新海軍之意見，氏認為中國有綿長的海岸綫，沒有海軍是不足以躋於强國之林的。，且南北皆有良港，為建立海軍之地理基礎。北方之青島，是理想中的良港。合灣之基隆為一南方之海軍根據地，福建除馬尾厦門可成要塞外，福鼎之沙壜灣為閩浙海岸毘連之所，港口有南關山橫峙，其內港澳深邃，兩岸崇山並立，極佔形勝，堪作軍港，且水深可進泊巨艦亦為一良好之海軍根據地，惜未為國人所注意。</p>
<p>建軍首重人才，海軍人才之培養費時耗財；極為不易，惟為國防大計，政府應全力為之。建立海軍非一朝一夕之事，賴有遠大之眼光。英國訓練海軍首重於一種海上精神之培養，值得師法。目下我國新海軍之訓練，承美國之協助，至深感謝。惟尤應有自求發展之精神，使中國新海軍日覓壯大，充實國防之力量。</p>
<p>將軍何所望唯望早和平</p>
<p>薩氏於去年來，因體弱關係，鮮與外界往來，每日由親屬誦讀報紙，藉以略窺時事。氏向記者探詢國內時局之發展，記者乃告以目下國內戰爭集中於魯南一隅，戰禍至烈，北方人民陷於水深火熱之中，共黨稱兵作亂，貽害國家至鉅。氏認為國家强盛為第一等大事，旣經長年抗戰，豈可再啓鬨牆之爭？惟有早日和平，始有國家之復興，否則國將不存，豈容黨派之存在。察其言表，將軍對於和平，殷望至深。</p>
<p>談泊以明志吟詩以自娛</p>
<p>將軍歷任軍政要職，垂數十載，兩袖清風，晚景蕭條。生活向甚刻苦，一如小民。一生以慈悲為懷，扶助孤貧，將軍所好者，惟吟詩寫字而已。抗戰軍興，中央特派出使南洋，宣慰華僑，深得僑界人士普遍之歡迎，之後，華僑輸將抗戰，將軍之行與有力焉。南洋任務完成後，西上重慶復命，中央當局甚為嘉許，　主席曾一再召見，備加慰勉。嗣後，川·陝·甘各地，皆有將軍足跡，年雖古稀，精神　鑠，猶能據鞍，顧盼自如，旅甘近三載，予西北人士印象至深。勝利後，將軍單騎凍返，去秋患血管硬化症，身體日弱、養疴竹園，此一代英豪，從此息影故鄉，以迄於今。</p>

<h3>滬中醫校學生呼聲</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我們是上海中醫學校的學生，因為我們的學校最近又被敎育部飭令停辦了，這次恐怕不比上次，停辦一定會成事實的。學校停辦切身關係，當然是我們一班學生，我們有的不遠千里而來，有的麽產借債而來，滿腔熱望，當頭一盆冷水潑來，怎不苦悶！</p>
<p>敎育部飭令停辦的理由，說我們學校經費師資設備課程都不合標準，不合標準，確是事實，不容否認，就是我們學生也很感到不滿，但合乎標準的中醫學校何處覓去？沒有覓處不得已只好擇個自己認為比較好的學校入學，敎育當局若能辦一所合乎標準的中醫學校，那是多麽好啊！我相信全國的中醫學校學生、一定會都跑來的。那時不合標準的中醫學校不待取締自然關門了，敎靑當局若不能辦一所合乎標準的中醫學校，則現有比較好的中醫學校，就不當取締，非但不當取締，理當予以輔導令其早日改善以達標準才對，因為私人的力量究然有限，國立大學以公家經費來辦，尚且處處不能如意，何况私立的，何况我們的校長是恃病家的診例為生的。</p>
<p>有的人說：「敎育部這種斷然的措置，就是暗示敎你們不要去學中醫」。中醫若果可淘汰了，那我們就不學中醫了。可是中醫責在尚未到淘汰的地步，世界上任何學術已到淘汰的地步，自然而然會消滅無形，不必加外力，今中醫屢經摧殘而始終存在者就是未屆淘汰之時期的明證。即使退一步來　，中醫可以淘汰了，是不是以西醫來代替？試問大部分的西醫設備怎樣，成績怎樣！醫德又怎樣？能否肩此重任？即使再退一步來講，西醫個個是好的，試問全國西醫有多少？可够替全國人民治病？不够將如何設法！即使更退一步來講，西醫之數已够，試問西醫所用的西藥，能否自足自給？無論怎樣講來，中醫目前絕對有存在的必要，我們的學校也絕對有存在價值。有存在價值的學校，强令停辦，豈能使我們服貼，豈是赴會人士之所望。敎育當局的先生們，希望允許我們仍舊在原校讀下去罷。</p>

<h3>論處理題材</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>到現在為止，人類畢竟還離不了現實社會而生活。因此，他（她）們就得處理事件，接觸人物，在這普通的事情當中，人們往往能够找到一點共同的感想，這感想經作家收集之後，就是通常文學之所謂主題。因此，作為一個文藝工作者，最先決的條件就是體驗實際生活。否則，閉門造車式的，製造出來的作品是不切實際的，不能反映現實，其作品是歸於毀滅的。</p>
<p>因之，在搜集題材時，就應該設身處地的去經歷過。比方說，曹禺的「日出」，多數人認為這是一本成功的劇本，作者以平凡的筆法，把生活在深淵裏的人的思想，見解，舉止描摹得飛淋漓盡致，我們看到劇中人陳白露，曉得她明知這樣做天和尚敲天鐘的生活下去，是沒有好結局的，其結果還不是走向死亡？但是，她却貪戀這一份物質的享受，她缺乏勇氣脫離這個地方，而跟着方達生走向自由的天地。金八一個社會上的惡覇，却有這麽大的勢力潛伏着，作者之能够將這些寫得這樣逼眞，就是在寫劇本以前，曾經實地的經歷過。</p>
<p>這種例子是很多很多的，巴爾扎克為了要描寫少女的思想，行動，曾經躲在他的愛人房中的床下私自的窺伺了一夜，結果這件事被他的愛人知道了，致他問她提出結婚的要求時，就以這個理由被他的愛人嚴詞拒絕了。喬治桑要描摹旅館茶役的生活、就去做了三個月的茶房，他（她）們的目的是很簡單的，一句話，就是要把所描寫的人表現得深刻，逼眞才不出此犧牲的。</p>
<p>至於如以十萬知識靑年從軍為題材的「靑春草」，那實在是太不眞實了，不要說作者沒有實際的經歷過，乾脆地說，作者運實際的思想也不曾有過一遍，這樣的作品無疑的是失其存在的價值的。</p>
<p>文學是大衆的，它含有極大的敎育意義，它能使人辨別正邪，它能貽人以極深刻的印象。因此，在搜集題材時，就不該草率，應該自問一下，這作品產生以後會有怎探的影響呢？</p>
<p>觀察，比較，研究這三個步驟是收集題材時的不可缺少的手段。</p>
<p>不過，文藝作品自有其誇張性，在彈性限度以內，它倒能帮助人物，事件使所表現的更為明朗，更為深刻！</p>

<p>公鴨和那兩隻母鴨向他們游來了－公鴨，自然，在中間，長得很漂亮而逗人喜歡，稍遠一點，第三隻母鴨在繼績着她那被拒絕的得不到安慰的求愛。只要她一挨得太近了，公鴨就朝她衝去，大張着啄，把她趕回去。然後她又裝着不知道自己所往何處的樣子，漫無目的，心神幌惚似地徘徊，逐漸挪近反抗她的公鴨。可是這個把戲是浪費了的；他早就看穿了，終於他攻向這可憐的心碎了的母鴨，那樣果敢地攻擊，她就只好逃命去了。</p>

<p>我嫁了米兒敦</p>
<p>後來我丈夫進來了，鎖上了鬥；而，百葉窗是已經閂好了的，現在只有我們兩人了。</p>
<p>我院掉了衣服之後，手裏拿着聖經爬上床。他溫柔地吻我，讀了一段給我聽：所羅門讚美他情婦底美貌，把她底肚子比做一堆麥子，乳房比做兩頭雙生的小鹿。然後他關上書，關書之前先放了一兩瓣玫瑰夾在裏面當作紀念；對我像煞愛人似地甜蜜地說話，可是說的是外國話，聲音粗野－我相信是叙利亞語，或是阿拉美語。稍後我就得又爬下床，和他並肩跪下，感謝上帝底無盡的恩典：他把我們一個造成男人，一個造成女人，此外又跟着他說了一大堆。「阿們」說完之後，他把我又抱到被窩裏去，一把抱住我，因强烈的情熱而戰慄。我沒說什麽，只是僵臥着，他抱起我底頭來說：「啊，謙遜的倔强！我讃美你！」獻了一杯酒到我底唇邊。我呷了一點，但是雖然我本來決定要使他高興，我却無法受他這種情熱底感染。之後，他向我這樣獻媚：把他到意大利去尋求一個新娘的漂亮的故事講給我聽……</p>
<p>除了「呵」「啊」「哼」…呌我怎樣回答他呢，他一邊講着，一邊小心溫存地撫弄我頭髮上的鬈鬈。</p>
<p>－Ｒ·格拉夫：「米爾敦之妻」</p>
<p>情書親愛的吉提小姐：</p>
<p>這是一封情書，我以你可以把它撇在一邊，而假如你覺得還像封情書的話，你就看它吧。</p>
<p>當然我原可以把這封信底要點秘而不宣，等我們下次會面的時候再說，可是我被汽車壓死的機會一直都是有的。那末，我寫信的動機就在於此了。</p>
<p>你走了之後，那天我呆望着石南花發痴…於是我底念頭就結成這樣了－吉提小姐是我所愛的，所讚美的，能使我愉快而且呌我信任的人。我們是隣居，這上面我感到極大的安慰與極深的　傲。那時我要是當眞對吉提小姐說了：「够多麽深…够多末大…」，她一定會由於奇窘而呆若木鷄的。</p>
<p>好，再見。戲院裏會。</p>

<p>「有些公馬一看見母馬就發在了，」佛理斯說…「可是這匹好萊塢的馬－他好極了！人家把他拉進馬房，他不聳，不跳，也不踢打，什麼都不。不過他很激動。他站在那裏注視她；你可以看出他胸肺底兩側上上下下，越來越快，越來越猛，他底兩眼閃灼着－緊張而凶猛。他呼吸困難起來了－你還可以看見他那灰色大馬衣下面的肌肉是强壯結實的。他眞是一個美人！</p>
<p>「她知道他在那裏，」佛理斯說：「她知道，她只是小小地呌了一下，溫柔的嘶聲。於是她全身起了一陣戰溧，從兩側一直抖到四蹄。</p>
<p>「他以巨響的嗅鼻聲從鼻孔裏吹氣，然後當馬夫們把他牽着在她四局溜的時候，他高高地舉起脚來。他走到她面前的時候，鼻子又吹氣，搖幌着腦袋，抖動馬鬃。天，眞美！他在表演給她看：他够多麽好看。也眞是哩，瞧，我注視他的時候，他在那裏昂首闊步，搖幌着腦袋，呼吸着火焰，眼睛閃亮，表示出他可眞了得……</p>
<p>「他在她身子四周繞了三次……他戰抖着。而她，準備好了。似乎，旣然他像那樣地再度向她保證，她底疑懼已沒有了哩。她不再害怕了。」——甜，朗斯特里。「雄馬路」（以上譯自Argosy-jan.1947）</p>
<h3>秋林步月</h3>
<p>— 許徵白</p>
<h3>帆</h3>
<p>— 夢農</p>
<p>有風，世界上便沒有帆，道情形，正像沒有海船便沒有燈塔一樣。</p>
<p>順風來也好，逆風來也好，帆是不帕風的。它會迎受一切，並且高揚起歡笑的歌聲，同時它會忍受一切的簸動，收放自如。</p>
<p>酒一樣的春風吹來的時候，它便沉醉在春風裏面。茶一樣的夏風吹到它的身上時，它便感到一身的輕快。烟一樣的秋風來了，它會自然而然的歸於甯靜。薑一樣尖辣的冬風吹上它的身子時，它也會咬住牙關，忍受苦辛，挨度難關，期待暫時的安息，準備永遠的前進。</p>
<p>懷着這樣的心情，帆是英勇堅毅起來了。暴風雨的侵襲，對於帆，不得不失掉逞威作亂的機會。</p>
<p>我愛聽一位被流放的大詩人萊蒙托夫所唱的一支動聽的歌，像箭一樣地穿在我的心的深處，作着永久的迴響：</p>
<p>在泛着綠波的霧海上，寂寞地飄動着一點白帆，是要向遙遠之國去追求什麼事物嗎？是為了些什麽而見棄於故土了嗎？</p>
<p>狂風吼呌着，波濤翻騰着，船桅彎彎曲曲地軋軋地發着呻吟的聲音。啊！它並不是在追求什麼幸福，它也不是為了幸福而受着顛簸啊。</p>
<p>脚底下，踐踏着比靑空更明亮的綠波，頭頂上，閃動着黃金色的太陽，但是，狂熱的帆，却憧憬着一塲暴風雨，彷彿只有在暴風雨裏才能够使它獲得安定一驟！</p>
<p>眞的，這樣勇於前進的帆，讓它跟着新的一代邁步挺進罷！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血203</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>他正忙着筆記的當口，那抽屜內的聲音又響了起來：</p>
<p>－你說這邊由你負責，是個什麽用意？－鶴見的聲音。</p>
<p>－我害怕那個女光棍，眞的翻臉……搜查－萍子說話。</p>
<p>－為什麼怕她搜查？－鶴。</p>
<p>－我有朋友在這裏！－萍。</p>
<p>－哈…誰？－鶴</p>
<p>－柳小姐－萍。</p>
<p>－柳詩小姐－萍。</p>
<p>－哈哈，你又在搗鬼！－鶴。（因為萍子也有一個中國名字呌「柳詩」）。</p>
<p>－決不搗鬼，她是一個又忠又孝的可憐孩子，正捨着性命帮助她父親，替韓人工作。－萍。</p>
<p>－你們什麽時候認識的？－鶴。</p>
<p>－昨天。－萍。</p>
<p>－誰介紹的？－鶴。</p>
<p>－靑木老師－萍。</p>
<p>－靑木長老替你介紹一個高麗革命黨</p>
<p>－那是西原寺老爺的意思，也是我們靑木老師這一系的大宗旨……情願讓高麗獨立。可是高麗是一隻懶象，需要一個象師訓練她，督責牠；以後就可成為朋友了。－萍。</p>
<p>－靑天白日說鬼話！旣要人家獨立，又要牽着人家鼻子跟着你跑，這是汁麽獨立？－鶴。</p>
<p>－這是國家大事，恕我不大明白……也許我們不牽牠，別人就會牽牠！－萍。</p>
<p>我們正聽到這裏，忽然門上輕輕敲了兩下，繼羣走了進來，換了一身衣服；長褲，襯衫，手上拿着一頂便帽，其餘的裝飾，便是她的「百竇囊」和手槍袋。在推開門一掃眼神的那一瞬，她早知這屋子的事，所以輕步進來，對我們　然微笑，行了一個掃射式的軍禮，姿式嫵媚矯健，隨即走到我身旁坐下。</p>
<p>「小老虎呢？」我耳語式的問她。</p>
<p>「在大廳裏，……他還沒忘記那幾樣點心咧」。耀羣笑着低聲告訴我。</p>
<p>「你們追到什麼地方回來？」</p>
<p>「交民巷口」。耀羣說到這裹，注意到抽屜裏的聲音，「可是收的東京播香？…怎麼有些像古先生……」耀羣不懂日語，以為播音的人，聲音像鶴見。</p>
<p>我趕緊把這裏的情形，告訴了牠，一面替她翻譯收聽的話：</p>
<p>－突擊用不着了，我上這裏來的時候，他們已經遵照東京命令，把關起來的支那人都放掉了。…示威也更用不着；我認為沒有意義。我想這時候最好潛伏一時，策應反攻，把些有用的血，洒在更有意義的工作上。－萍</p>
<p>聽到這裏，我忽然感覺不安，認為鶴見不該把我們突擊的計劃告訴萍子。可惜我和耀羣說話的當口，沒有聽見鶴見同萍子說的什麽，不知他們怎樣從高麗問題，忽然扯到突擊問題來了。金月亭</p>
<h3>北窗之讚</h3>
<p>— 金月亭</p>
<p>多少人讀美過窗子。他們用它去普喩美人流轉的明胖，說：眼睛是靈魂的窗子。現在我要說：窗子是屋子的眼睛，窗帘是它的睫毛。</p>
<p>想想看，一個沒有窗戶的屋子；漆黑而陰濕，霉腐了的空氣。即使是一個充沛了生命活力的人，一住下來也會變得遲鈍而拘謹，像初入獄的犯人。</p>
<p>窗子使屋子裏的人和世界生活在一塊，給他看許多美好的事物，聽許多奇妙的聲音。得他在生活，這生活像琴韻一樣地和諧，一樣的明净。</p>
<p>我讚美窗子，因為我有着一個窗子，這窗子是向北開的。</p>
<p>當我們初搬進這小屋子來的時候，隣居的朋友們都為我們的壤運道而嘆息，說：瞧瞧這向北的窗十。北國的冬天那裏比得上江南的溫煦呢，風呀雪呀，殺殺他從窗　　　進來，會使我們受不了。</p>
<p>受不了也得受，因為我們是被派定的。我們開始為自己解嘲，說窗子雖然是向北的，可是終究是窗子呀。任何一扇窗子都能使我們生活得快樂，向南的固然好，向北的又何妨呢。</p>
<p>我們就振作起來，把窗玻璃細心地拭抹了，不讓有一點塵埃留在它的上面。</p>
<p>這樣我們就唸起書來；白天，黑夜，書桌臨着窗子，</p>
<p>我們讀的是工程。打發不盡的數字，　閱不盡的岡表。喝茶的時候，數字隨着茶葉的梗子浮沉；睡着的時候，在蒙裹呌喊出數字。生活在最煩　的城市裏，我們竟沾染上可怕的寂寞了。</p>
<p>然而這寂寞不會長久滯留着的，因為窗子站在我們的臉前。</p>
<p>我們臨窗遠眺。我們看到自天而降的第一　黃葉，接着是無邊落太蕭蕭下的秋意的濃密。黃昏，黑羽毛的烏鴉棲息在窗前的大樹上，艱潔地吱喳着，彷彿在祈求人們的感謝，因為它是那時僅有的鳴禽。電燈亮了，窗子蒙上燈光，　　意朦朧的亮眼。顯着這亮眼，我們會看到一個鳥頭髪的男孩子迎着一個秀髮藍衣的女孩子跑過去，在牆脚根傳滬一些愛的低訴，又私自愉樂地跑開了。</p>
<p>冬天來了。北國的冬天委實冷得多，假如江南的冬天也得用冷來形容的話。</p>
<p>然而我們沒敢說冷，為的是怕委曲了窗子。假如寒冷使我們受罪，它是有責任的；因為它向北開着。</p>
<p>整個的冬天，是在風裏雪裏過的。。</p>
<p>窗玻璃上凝着一層薄薄的冰，像少女臉上的面紗。　我們望不見窗外的天空，我們的生活重又凍結起來。沉重的寂寞，繁琑的數字。</p>
<p>我們焦燥地等待，用耳朵傾聽冬天的過去。單調的更柝，凄厲的火車的鳴笛，黑羽毛烏鴉的聒噪，爐子裏煤花的迸裂，和雪花撲擊窗戶的聲音。</p>
<p>整個的冬天是在寂寞　過的。</p>
<p>然而春天畢竟要來的。馬路上的少女脫去了面紗，窗子也脫去了面紗，像第一次拭抹後的那般明爭。</p>
<p>我們又臨窗遠眺。窗子向着春天，我們的生活也轉向春天。</p>
<p>我們會永遠感謝窗子，雖然它是向北的。</p>

<h3>紫燕</h3>
<p>— 僅珊</p>
<p>假如我是一隻紫燕，泥巢築在您底簷前：淸晨偸瞧羞紅暈上笑靨，春意鎖着惺忪的春眠，那時不用您招一招纖手，輕輕一翅，便投入您底夢邊，</p>
<p>我眞　羨一隻紫燕，她整天在您窗口呢喃。當相思沈入黃昏底寂靜，聽夜雨灑上窗櫺；一盞孤燈伴着春愁，她只是默默地守着您底窗口（三十六年三月改舊作）</p>
<h3>無鶴樓與翠屏山</h3>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>水滸傳描寫叔殺嫂事，先後凡兩見，一為武松，一為石秀，而後者之事，則在河北薊縣，迄今尚有遺蹟可攷也。薊縣城內大街有舞鶴樓，危樓一角，掩映綠楊陰裏，父老相傳，即舊時楊雄繼妻潘巧雲之妝樓。</p>
<p>薊城外之盤山，為昔時畿輔名區，下盤翠屏山，乃楊雄石秀殺潘氏處。山畔感化寺，建築雄偉，壁上題詩殆滿，中有五言古詩一首，咏巧雲事殊可誦，今錄於此。詩曰：「日落翠屏山，驅車過其右，人言潘氏女，昔作楊家婦，府吏府中趨，空房愁獨守。情天有壞空，佛法無净垢；阿難戒體毀，觀音鏁骨朽，至今梳妝樓，隱的蔽垂柳。一客聽未終，整襟屢搖首，處初說九百，君子不上口；悠悠滕薜爭，誰能置可否？呼僮且晚炊，為我爇斗酒，宜和世已遙，茲事莫須有。」詠俗事而能典雅，良非易易，惜不知為何人所作！</p>
<p>明末，洪承疇奉思宗命，率師出關，與滿洲兵戰於松山杏山，軍敗降敵，其稗將某祝髪盤山，號智朴，作靑松紅杏圖，隱寓往事。上人極風雅，清初之名士巨卿，多樂與之往還。著有盤山志，謂上盤之勝以松，中盤之勝以石，下盤之勝以水，固不若水滸傳所寫之翠屏山，丘塚纍纍，另具一種荒凉寂寞之概也。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>「愛是有條件的嗎？」兩個靑年朋友在那裏面紅耳赤地各執一辭。最後要我來批判他們的話，我制止他們二彼此間表示各個的理由——事實上我已經總得够多的了，而且也不止一次了。</p>
<p>「我不能答尤為你們來一次所謂　批判，我只能就你們所爭執的間題表示我的意見；因為愛是一個奇怪的字，古往今來不知道有多少對於他的詮解和辯論，」我這樣開始了我的話，接着我簡單地說：</p>
<p>「和宇宙與生命一樣，愛是一種存在，同樣的我們也很難瞭解牠的究竟。我們只能就其在歷史上所呈現的，予以總合的響繹——</p>
<p>「因此，我認為我們所辯論的不是愛的本質是什麽？（那是和宇宙與生命的所由，同樣困難的問題。）而是愛的過程；這，至少在我的體騐中，已經被認為相當簡單的問題了。</p>
<p>「借用你們彼此間辯論時常用的辭句，我說愛是從有條件底理智底出發到無條件底感情的境界。」</p>
<p>兩個青年朋友，沒有異議地，欣謝而去。</p>
<p>從自由談讀到芳君的大作「戀愛離婚興夫婦」，我完全不敢茍同這篇文章的意見。芳君的意思是男女結婚以後，應捨棄你所有的異性朋友，至少不許單獨和異性朋友往來。</p>
<p>道裏，我願意坦白地表示我的看法。</p>
<p>每一個人（無論男女）我想如果用圓周來形象美滿的話，在他（她）們底軀殼或靈魂領域所能獲得的最大面積或最大成就，僅只是一百八十度，如果想究成三百大十度的話，那麽得仰給於另外的一個生命。</p>
<p>事實上每個人很難完成本身的最大面積或最大成就。是故他（她）們永世享受不到眞正的美滿，但也並不影響他（她）們片面的主觀的快樂。</p>
<p>偉大的人，如托爾斯泰，歌德－…據我看他們因為完成了自己靈魂上的一百八十度，而才能特別感到落漢的悲哀長。如果控他們為濫施愛情，那未免太寃屈了。因為他們不能獲得另外的半個圓周。華　的大廈往往窩着庸俗的市，美麗的軀轂，也往往藏着粗陋的靈魂。（本段待續）</p>
<h3>六十中委的提案　－要求即行撤換陳儀</h3>
<p>— 飛龍飛龍</p>
<p>中委六十人，要求撤職陳儀——這一消息如果確實的話，那麽賢明的政府，是可以把合灣民衆的憤怒，平息下來的。</p>
<p>我們對於台灣的現狀，並不淸楚；但是，有一點可以看出來：陳儀的作風與最高當局的意旨，並不完全符合；比如最高當局說，處置台灣變亂，決計用和平方式，可是，台灣軍警出動，三步一崗，五步一警，完全入於軍事狀態。又在政府同意下台灣慰勞團，赴台灣撫慰，據說却給長官公署的軍警人員，監視了一晚上，第二天被迫飛離台灣。</p>
<p>這表示陳儀處置合灣的事件，主觀上以為武力儘可以壓制變亂，其實，這是錯誤的。</p>
<p>民眾的變亂，有時是一時激於義憤，或許也有過激之處；但一部份，恐還是一年多來台灣省政府與台灣民眾確實有間隙怨恨之處，如若政府能體察民情，採棄癥結所在，事態不難緩和下來的。</p>
<p>所以三中全會六十中委向政府要求撇換陳儀，這是一個極明智的舉措。只要這曾在敵人手裏五六十年的民衆，確實能够改變他們，重新向着祖國，這確有待於政府對合灣現狀慎加考慮的了。</p>
<h3>上海人的男女關係</h3>
<p>— 施娟瑛</p>
<p>在飛下人目光中看來，上海人的男女關係是比較走前了一步。可是上海人自己知道，這一步却走得旣不前進又不落伍，是頗為尷尬的。鄉下人男女結合必須經過結婚，上海人則把姘居看成布鬆平常，有了拼居的關係，就與結髪夫妻一樣可以同出同進。</p>
<p>然而上海人還是不能不把這姘居看得認眞。姘居以後，雙方就互相負着責任，在法律上說，就是同居。此時倘有一方忽然不願同居了，就有被控遺棄的可能，一方面是拼拼搭搭，好像頗為自由，一方面是拼搭以後倘然後悔，却無法同樣自由地擺脫。上海人活在這個社會裏，就不能逃避此種矛盾，實在是一件苦痛的事，自然最後吃虧還是啼人與孺子飛已。</p>
<p>最近某開人之子虞某，被陳姓女控告遺棄。據陳說：這位虞少爺，是個沒有正式妻子的人，都是些姘頭。而虞某說起陳姓女的兒子，却說：「所生小孩是否我生，我並不知道。」不管兩人所說是眞是假，上海人男女關係的比鄉下跨前一步，於是倒是可見的，　尬之處，便是雖然兩人並未正式結婚，却並非可以隨便分手，一個女人養了兒子，她　要為他認明父親，為的這樣不但確定他的身份，還　他在經濟上有個着落，我們這個社會默許了女子與人自由結合的便利，却沒有給她們第二步的保障，有之唯有哭哭啼啼求之於那個男人。這是一種無獨立性的可憐的保障。</p>
<p>其次可憐的便是那「愛的結晶」了。他的身份是搖擺不稽的。雖怪上面這件遺棄案開審時，在塲的一位同情的記者，在他的筆下特地記了一筆。說那孩子畏得與虞某很像，使那個男人無從抵賴。一個孩子要在長得與「父親」相像（到最後也許還要騐血）才能被認為人的兒子，豈不是一件可憐的事麼？然而更可憐的，卻是孩子所受的敎育。因貧輟學且不去說了。庭上問他：「你不要跟他（虞某）去，你要什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我要錢」！</p>
<p>這三個字讀來如聞其聲，而這個孩子在如此父母關係之下所得到的一切也被三個字一言道盡了。</p>

<p>三十四年冬，太虛法師卓錫陪都長安寺，友人秦翼雲君，以嘗夢見其妹（因居陷區）病中苦楚狀，勝利後得訊，始知妹早作古，彌留時病苦狀態，一如夢中所見，爰於某夜嬲余偕訪，叩詢佛法中關於靈魂學之奧旨。法師為言：「佛法中有六通，能通靈感。近有人能令「他心」在類似催眠狀態中，洞悉靈界中一切形聲者，此乃五通。前此伍廷芳先生能藉蒙境施感應，則更為靈學之初步成就；印度亦有人能之。至催眠云云，義殊未妥，改稱「寂感」，方為恰當；渠於十年飾，即曾倡此說」云。</p>
<p>法師言時，引經據典，闡述甚詳。惜余學殖荒落，未能盡悟。今法師圓寂，其弟子容有　集遺言，輯為專書者，因追記所聞梗概，用備採錄。</p>

<h3>人身的奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>你明白了大部分關於人類的身體及所以健康的原因後，「你便會奇怪為什麼人要生病呢。一個醫生說：「假使我的病人有充分的休息，適當的食物以及心的安適，百分之九十以上的病可以不治而愈。」因為人身和船一樣，可以修復那些對於日常健康的小打擊，以及暴病後的身體。</p>
<p>人類的器官，常需要的時候，是有後備的，一個人患脯癆的時候，雖然有一部分是摧毀了，但是他仍有比他所需要更多的肺組織，他利用了後備的力量，來維持他的生命。</p>
<p>有一個博士，僅剩了一小部分健全的肺，但是他仍工作了四十年之久。事實告訴我們，一個人韋掉了他五分之二的肝，可以照常生活下去。常我們　到醫生動手術的時候，割斷或　縛了三四十根血管，我們一定會奇怪這些血管在停止循環後將怎樣呢？但是我們還有比我們所須要的更多呢，每人約有二十二尺的　，但是假使拿去三四尺，我們絲毫不會發生問題。</p>
<p>當心臟的心瓣，發炎或變形的時候，那時情形好像一扇門的一半開了，道樣逐漸變形後，心臟慢慢加厚，筋肉亦漸漸增强，一個心臟平常如拳頭一樣大的，可以增至二個三個或者甚至於四個一樣的大小，一個人必須這樣，否則他就不能活下去了。</p>
<p>有一個醫生拿去了一病人之一腎部後，另外一個便開始長大成二倍大，做二倍的工作，所有的組織從新建造，你們要知道腎臟的建造，是比平常的建築物更複雜而不同，這奇異的能力，即所謂「人身的奇蹟」。</p>
<p>另外一個天然的防禦力是休息，假使你扭轉了你的筋骨，在醫生未來之前，天然力把夾板夾好，因他便扭轉的地方變得如此的疼痛及不易轉動，這樣可以使我們不敢去動他。一人感情極端衝動的時候，或者極度驚嚇時，自然說了：「休息吧！」於是那人失去知覺，他「暈了」！</p>
<p>神力賦給我們極大的醫治能力，使我們健康，他有一個永遠不倦的智力，那些醫生們是模傲的，我們在和疾病奮鬥的時候，我們時常有一種宏大的智能和力量在我們一邊工作着。</p>

<h3>Seven-Congress Session Postponed, Twelve Central Executive Committee Members Re-elected, Third Plenum Continues Review of Party Affairs and Economy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee held its eighth and ninth sessions from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss proposals and re-elect one-third of the Central Standing Committee members. Commissioners Chen Cheng and Chen Lifu will respectively serve as chairmen. Originally scheduled to close on the 22nd, the session will now be extended for several days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee convened its sixth meeting on the morning of the 21st. While continuing to review party affairs, in addition to expressing opinions and suggestions on general party affairs, personnel systems, and cadre training, Central Committee members Cui Zhenhua, Huang Yuren, and Jiao Yitang successively spoke, all agreeing that the Central Standing Committee should bear more responsibility in the future and possess decisive authority to share the heavy burden of daily affairs for the Director-General. In the afternoon, when discussing the method for re-electing Standing Committee members as proposed by the presidium, the committee members engaged in heated discussions, with more than twenty members speaking. They expressed various opinions on the one-third re-election method for the 36 Standing Committee members and whether they could be re-elected consecutively. As a result, it was decided to adopt a lottery method, and the twelve Standing Committee members to be re-elected would be selected through secret ballot. By this point, it was already 7:00 PM, and the eighth meeting, originally scheduled to convene at 8:00 PM on the 21st, was postponed to 9:00 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At the beginning of the sixth session of the Third Plenum, the focus was on continuing to review party affairs, with a break at 10:45 AM. From 11:00 AM, the review of the economy began, with Commissioners Cheng Zhongxing, Lu Dangping, and Huang Yuren speaking. Cheng believed that the Ministry of Finance had failed to adequately regulate the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau regarding the gold and currency crisis and requested Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to attend the meeting to explain. Huang Yuren fully advocated for disciplinary action against corrupt officials, stating that personnel appointments within the party should be based on talent and ability and that military personnel without political capabilities should not be appointed as provincial governors to avoid harming local areas. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Director-General Chiang Attends Seventh Session to Report</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee held its seventh session at the National Assembly Hall at 3:25 PM on the 21st, with 258 members present. Commissioner Chen Guofu chaired the session. First, Director-General Chiang made a comprehensive report on party affairs, politics, economy, diplomacy, finance, and military affairs. After a ten-minute break at 4:40 PM, the discussion of matters began. The following two proposals were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to Postpone the Seventh National Congress.</p>
<p>The Sixth National Congress was convened in Chongqing on May 5, 1945. According to the General Regulations (held once every two years), the time for convening the next Congress has arrived. However, the elections in various local party branches have not yet been fully completed, and in accordance with the constitutional implementation preparation sequence, various elections will be held this year. Therefore, after deliberation by the presidium, it is proposed to postpone the Congress for one year in accordance with Article 27, Paragraph 2 of the General Regulations (when the Central Executive Committee encounters unavoidable circumstances, it may postpone the convocation of the regular session of the National Congress, but not for more than one year).</p>
<p>(2) Method for Re-electing Central Standing Committee Members. The Second Plenary Session decided that one-third of the 36 Central Standing Committee members would be re-elected at each plenary session. This session will implement this. The Presidium has prepared a method for re-election and submitted it for public decision and implementation: 1. A lottery method will be used to determine the order of the list of one-third of the Standing Committee members to be re-elected at each plenary session. 2. Those on the list to be re-elected at this session will be selected by this plenary session through secret ballot.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang, in his address at the Third Plenum on the 21st, reviewed diplomatic, economic, military, and political work item by item for seventy minutes, also pointing out the party's shortcomings and strengths. Chairman Chiang first discussed foreign policy, stating that the diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union was completely correct and that friendly relations should be maintained with all countries. He further stated that the approval of Outer Mongolia's independence was a major achievement in the government's diplomatic efforts, that the Chinese people have always valued justice and trusted the right to self-government, therefore recognizing Outer Mongolia's independence as an achievement. In the economic realm, the crisis of last year had been overcome, the government had received enemy and puppet assets, obtaining large amounts of goods and gold, so the economy was no longer in danger of collapse, and he had confidence in American financial aid. The government, once it obtained the American loan, would use it to carry out national reconstruction work and would definitely not use it for fighting the Communist army. Militarily, the Chinese Communists had been continuously preparing for a war with the government for the past eight years, but recent events had proven that the Communist army could be defeated. Politically, the Kuomintang sincerely welcomed other parties to participate in the reorganization of the government. "We invite other parties to participate not as guests but on an equal basis to jointly promote the realization of the wish to return power to the people." The Kuomintang itself hopes that party members will make loyal and frank criticisms, not malicious attacks like those made by the enemy party.</p>

<h3>Tongliao Falls for Six Days, City Transformed Beyond Recognition</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] Tongliao Telegram: This time, Tongliao fell into the hands of the Communist Army for six days, and the city's appearance has been completely transformed. When reporters re-entered the urban area yesterday, they witnessed the destruction of all public buildings and fortifications in the city. Residents with assets were robbed clean. The relatively intact civilian houses were destroyed, and the relief supplies transported by the Relief Administration were also completely looted. The scene is extremely tragic, and the overall loss figures cannot be calculated at this time.</p>
<h3>Scattered Communist Troops in Jilin Still Attempting to Disrupt</h3>

<h3>Northern Shaanxi Communist Army Attempts to Flee to Shanxi, Food in Suide and Qingjian Looted, No Trace of Communist Army in Suburbs of Yan'an</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 21st] Amidst the nationwide celebrations of the recapture of Yan'an, the people of Shanxi are paying close attention to the increasingly serious situation in Shanxi. Several thousand family members of the Chinese Communists have recently and in the past crossed from northern Shaanxi to the east and moved to northwestern and southeastern Shanxi. There have been no reports of defeated troops fleeing into Shanxi, but it is only a matter of time. It is expected that Datong will be the first to be threatened. The Shanxi authorities are preparing to meet this serious situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] It is learned that all strategic points north, southeast, and southwest of Yan'an have been occupied by the National Army. The Communist Army is currently fleeing in different directions towards Suide and Qingjian. It is rumored that the Communist Army is currently crossing the Yellow River at Wubao, fleeing towards Lishi, Zhongyang, Shilou, Xingxian, Linxian, and Fangshan (all in western Shanxi). The headquarters of the Communist Army is located in a certain area in northern Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 21st] The Communist Army in the Shilou, Xixian, and Yonghe areas of southwestern Shanxi has been moving frequently in recent days, seemingly attempting to cross the Yellow River to reinforce the remaining Communists in northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] After the National Army occupied Yan'an, it cleared out scattered Communist troops near the county seat. After two days and nights of searching, there was no trace of the Communist Army within 20 li around the Purple City.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] In the Suide area, the Communist Army set up a transfer station every 30 li, with 200 civilian laborers assigned to each station to transport military supplies day and night. The food in Suide and Qingjian counties has been completely searched and looted. In Yonghe, the Communist Army has conscripted men aged 16 to 30 into militia teams, those aged 31 to 40 into stretcher teams, and those aged 45 to 50 into transportation teams.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] While clearing the remains of Communist troops outside Yan'an, the bodies of Luo Yanping, brigade commander of the Communist Army's Second Education Brigade, and his chief of staff have been discovered. There are many other bodies of senior military officers, but due to the lack of symbols and belongings, it is difficult to confirm their names and positions. They are currently being identified by defecting Communist troops.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Luo was killed by the National Army in the Jinpenwan area north on the night of March 17.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A small-sized newspaper here published a telegram from its special correspondent in northern Shaanxi, dispatched from Yan'an on the afternoon of the 20th, stating: (1) The National Army that recovered Yan'an began to advance in a fan shape in three directions—northwest, north, and southwest—from the morning of the 20th. The remaining Communist troops in Erzhai (formerly the mountain stronghold where Zhang Xianzhong gathered) in northern Yan'an fled to Anding. At 6:00 AM, they entered Liushui Gorge, the location of the Zhang Xianzhong Ancestral Hall. Qingjian can be captured in a matter of days. The Communist Army may resist stubbornly in Jiuli Mountain, north of Qingjian, relying on its dangerous terrain. The National Army advancing south from Yulin is also advancing towards Mizhi. The two armies may meet in Suide. (2) Since the afternoon of the 18th, the main force of the Communist Army has been crossing the Yellow River at Wubao, east of Suide, in hundreds of wooden boats, fleeing towards northwestern Shanxi. Under the suppression of aircraft, the situation is very embarrassing. (3) The Lyuliang Mountains area in northwestern Shanxi has become an important base for the Communist Army after its withdrawal from northern Shaanxi, but it will once again fall into the triangular position of the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and the National Army in northern Yanbei. (4) The reporter visited Liushui Gorge, the former residence of Zhang Xianzhong northeast of Yan'an, on the morning of the 20th. The area was built as an ancient Fushi during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty. Because the Communist Party regarded Zhang as a peasant revolution hero, they built an ancestral hall for him with a large construction project. The horizontal plaque, "Zhang Xianzhong Ancestral Hall," was personally written by Mao Zedong. Most of the buildings were destroyed by artillery fire. Zhang's former residence was converted into a "Struggle Hall" by the Communist Party. He saw the corpses of two naked female Communist cadres hanging from the beams, a rather tragic scene. (5) Eight or nine out of ten buildings in Yan'an were destroyed. He personally saw an old woman with white hair cooking rice porridge to feed the National Army and saw National soldiers wrapping wounds for Communist soldiers, taking the milk from their bodies, diluting it, and pouring it into the mouths of Communist soldiers. (6) Among the more than 10,000 defecting Communist troops, there are approximately 1,000 female cadres and students, all wearing gray military uniforms. The military authorities have decided to pay each defecting Communist soldier one month's salary according to their rank. Those who hand over a rifle will receive a bonus of 100,000 yuan, and those who hand over a machine gun will receive 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] After the National Army entered Yan'an, the Xian (yang)-Yu (lin) Highway, the main transportation route in northern Shaanxi, is expected to be opened to Yan'an. However, the Luochuan-Yan'an section has not been in operation for a long time, and the roadbed along the line has been completely destroyed by the Communist Army. The Shaanxi Provincial Highway Bureau has organized an emergency engineering team since the 21st, carrying tools, to rush north from Yaoxian to repair it and plans to set up stations for traffic.</p>
<h3>Post-War Measures for Northern Shaanxi Planned, Zhu Shaozhou Says He Will Personally Visit Counties to Console</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] After the National Army recovered Yan'an, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Zhu Shaozhou, chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, to inquire about his views. Zhu answered each question as follows:</p>
<p>Question: After the liberation of Yan'an, what are the provincial government's post-war plans for the counties in northern Shaanxi?</p>
<p>Answer: This government has formulated key points for emergency measures based on the various decrees of the pacification zone promulgated by the central government. There are concise regulations on the civil affairs, finance, education, construction, land administration, and food for the recovered counties. I have also telegraphed the commissioners, instructing them to take six important measures in the recovered areas within this year: (1) Exempting land taxes; (2) Suspending the conscription of soldiers; (3) Prohibiting various arbitrary levies; (4) Prohibiting the use of all illegal banknotes; (5) Encouraging the people to love and help each other and strictly prohibiting all acts of revenge; (6) The land currently under cultivation should continue to be cultivated as before. If there are disputes, they will be resolved according to law later, and spring plowing must be supervised and initiated to avoid missing the farming season. As for medical and relief matters in the recovered areas, the Health Department has been instructed to organize medical rescue teams to handle medical affairs. In terms of relief, in addition to allocating funds from this government to handle emergency relief, I have also telegraphed the central government requesting a large amount of money to be allocated for relief and compensation to ensure that the people can live and work in peace as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Question: Has the provincial government dispatched local administrative personnel to the recovered areas?</p>
<p>Answer: Cadres have been selected and dispatched separately.</p>
<p>Question: Will the provincial government send a special envoy to console the recovered counties?</p>
<p>Answer: I and Chiang, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, will personally visit the recovered areas in the shortest possible time to console the people.</p>
<p>Question: What are the chairman's impressions of the recapture of Yan'an this time?</p>
<p>Answer: Yan'an has been occupied by the Chinese Communists for thirteen years. Not only is it the manufacturing center for all plans that harm the country and the people, but it is also the base for planning opium cultivation and drug production. This time, the National Army's recapture is a great blessing for the people of Shaanxi. However, there is one point that the Chinese Communists should deeply reflect on, that is, the country should seek progress in peaceful construction. The dream of seizing power by force should be awakened as soon as possible to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to the people.</p>

Now Hu has returned to Beiping, and He Siyuan, the person who forwarded the letter, has also gone to Nanjing.

<h3>Steps for Government Reorganization Determined: First the National Government Committee, then the Executive Yuan; Proposals for Political Reform from Various Parties are Under Review by a Subcommittee</h3>
<p>Key Members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Arrive in Nanjing</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] All political parties have placed unlimited hope in the reorganization of the government, and therefore have some opinions on the future of politics. The government also hopes that the reorganized government can meet the expectations of all parties. Therefore, Lei Zhen has repeatedly invited members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to Nanjing for consultations. On the morning of the 21st, more than ten members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, including Li Daming, Jiang Yuntian, Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and Li Huang, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. At 10:00 a.m., Sun Ke invited Li and others to a meeting at the Lixingshe. Attendees included government officials Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Dingchang, social figures Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, Democratic Socialist Party members Li Daming, Jiang Yuntian, Sun Baogang, Xu Fulin, Wan Renqian, Tang Zhuxin, Youth Party members Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Li Li, Li Keji, Yu Jiaju, Liu Dongyan, and Chen Qitian. Chairman Sun Ke separately requested the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party to present their views on reforming the current politics, totaling twelve items from the Kuomintang, one item from the Democratic Socialist Party, and eight points from the Youth Party. Although the goals were the same, the opinions differed. At that time, it was decided to appoint representatives to form a review subcommittee to review these proposals so that they could reach a common point of view and create a concrete and permanent plan as the target for government reorganization. However, this action is separate from the submission of lists of names by the various parties and should not be confused. The review subcommittee met at Wu Dingchang's residence at 5:00 p.m. on the 21st. Attendees included Mo Dehui, Chen Bulei, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Li Daming, and Jiang Yuntian. Mo chaired the meeting, which adjourned at 9:00 p.m. Each party carefully studied the three proposals. Since the discussion was not completed today, it was scheduled to continue at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd. It is reported that Zhang Junmai will come to Nanjing on the 22nd and will also participate in the discussion. The meeting may continue for several days. It is learned that the Democratic Socialist Party's proposal is the two items that Jiang Yuntian submitted to the chairman some time ago. The points listed in the content are nothing more than (1) resolving the Kuomintang-Communist problem through political means, (2) thoroughly implementing democracy in politics, (3) eliminating excessive taxes in finance, (4) revitalizing diplomacy and strengthening friendly relations with various countries, and (5) designating specific uses for foreign loans. The Youth Party's views are also to improve diplomatic relations, protect the people's freedom and rights, and alleviate the people's suffering.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At today's meeting of representatives from the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, Youth Party, and social figures, the steps for reorganizing the government were discussed and decided, first reorganizing the National Government Committee and then the Executive Yuan, and it is expected to be completed before the end of the month.</p>

Zhang left his residence and arrived at the North Station at 10:45 last night. He originally planned to lead the members of the Central Standing Committee to Nanjing on the same train as Lei Zhen. However, he caught a cold on the way and gradually felt unwell upon arrival at the station, so he returned to his residence to rest. It is reported that Zhang will go to Nanjing in the next few days as soon as his health recovers.</p>

We should broaden our horizons, eliminate regional concepts, and unite with love and sincerity as if we were hands and feet.

<h3>Shanghai Coal Merchants Urge the Government to Quickly Improve the Control of Coal Sources</h3>
<p>Petition Representatives Receive Reporters in Nanjing</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Xie Hengting and the other seven representatives of the Shanghai Coal Merchants Association petition group received reporters from various newspapers in Nanjing this afternoon, appealing to the government to improve the control of coal sources so that the 1,196 coal shops and more than 200,000 employees in Shanghai would not be cut off from their livelihood. According to Xie Hengting, the government's control of coal sources was originally intended to be impeccable, but those in charge of the matter mismanaged it, causing the production of coal sources to shrink, and industrial and commercial factories were greatly affected. In addition, the executors often had the fact of issuing inflated allocations, and did not take into account those who used coal as fuel on a daily basis, which led to the creation of a black market. The coal merchants came to Nanjing this time, hoping that the government could improve the unreasonable state of allocation, and at the same time reallocate the excess coal allocated to various factories to the coal merchants, or allocate 25,000 tons per month to save the livelihood of the coal merchants. It is reported that after they petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and others, Minister Wang Yunwu has agreed to consider it. The petition representatives will return to Shanghai by train on the morning of the 22nd.</p>

<h3>Director of Land Administration Zheng Zhenyu Discusses: Plan for Reorganizing the Yellow River Flood Area; Methods for Topographic Surveying and Land Rights Reorganization are Drafted</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] After the closure of the Huayuankou breach, the urgent task at hand is the reorganization of the flooded area. A reporter from this newspaper recently visited Zheng Zhenyu, Director of the Land Administration, to inquire about the plan and implementation period of this work. He said: The total area of the flooded area is 270 million mu, half of which needs government assistance for reorganization. The work plan has been drafted with the relevant agencies and authorities, and it consists of two major items: (1) topographic surveying, (2) land rights reorganization. The former is easier to carry out, but it will not be possible until the second half of this year; the latter is more difficult to handle, but the current method decided is roughly as follows: (1) The original landowners' contracts should be used as the basis for dividing the land, but it is not necessary to follow the designated location in the original contract; (2) The land in the Yellow River flooded area is mostly covered with deep-rooted weeds and cannot be cultivated in a short period of time. It has been decided to use UNRRA machinery to cultivate the land, and then hand it over to the farmers for cultivation after it is mature; (3) After surveying and distribution, there will be surplus land, and the land with no owner may account for one-third. The government can use it as a public farm and as the center of agriculture, water conservancy, education, sanitation, security, and politics in the nearby rural areas. Establish a reclamation area management office, and set up this kind of public farm widely in various regions, which will also become a town. According to Zheng, the implementation period of this plan depends on the technical assistance of UNRRA. However, UNRRA will end its work in August of this year, while the branch offices in the flooded area will continue to work for a considerable period of time until the relief work is completed.</p>

<h3>Lu Salt is Being Exported to Japan</h3>
<p>MacArthur Allocates Ships to Depart from Tanggu</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Salt industry news: Lu salt is being exported to Japan. The transportation tools are ships allocated by MacArthur, departing from Tanggu. It is reported that the price is lower than the market price, which is 210 yuan per catty. According to people in the salt industry, salt tax accounted for 70% of the national tax revenue last year. The salt production in the north is very abundant, and it is almost impossible for salt merchants to hoard it, so the salt price itself has not fluctuated. Each adjustment of the salt price is due to the salary increase of public officials, because the salaries of public school teachers and staff across the country are paid from the salt tax.</p>

<h3>Confiscating Troops Falsely Accused of Robbery; Hong Kong Police Bureau Muddle Through Interrogation; Guangdong Has Already Pursued Negotiations Through Diplomatic Channels</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou 21st Dispatch] On February 6th, four security team soldiers intercepted smugglers illegally transporting grain abroad near Baishizhou in Bao'an County. The smugglers resisted arrest and opened fire. Team soldiers Guo Xiangmin and Ye Qihuan were killed, and the remaining Tan Maisheng and Wu Guisheng had their weapons confiscated and were taken to the Pingshan Police Station in British Hong Kong. They were falsely accused of carrying military fire and looting ships. The Hong Kong side then sent Tan and Wu to the Kowloon Court for trial, accusing Tan and Wu of attacking with guns and intending to rob, as well as illegally possessing weapons. The provincial government believes that the team soldiers were ordered to crack down on smuggling in the country's territorial waters, which was a legitimate task, but the British side distorted the facts and spoke for the smugglers, which is deeply regrettable. It has already negotiated with the British side through diplomatic channels to return the team soldiers and weapons, and extradite the smuggling and inspection-refusing ships and criminals for legal action.</p>

<h3>The Necessity of Quickly Planning for the Aftermath of the Yellow River Flood Area</h3>
<p>The closing project of the Yellow River's Huayuankou breach was successfully completed on the 15th of this month; this major event relating to the safety of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan was successfully completed. The news came, and the four provinces were pleased. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which is being held in the capital, sent a telegram to commend the employees of the closing project, which is enough to show the importance of the Yellow River closing project to the national economy and the people's livelihood!</p>
<p>The Yellow River is China's main waterway. Its history is as long as the Chinese nation. Since Yu guided the river successfully, the river has not been harmful. There were times of prosperity during the Han and Tang Dynasties. During the Five Dynasties, the Yellow River had a trend from north to east, and during the Song Dynasty, it had a trend from east to south. By the time of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties, its trend became increasingly southward and could not be controlled. Every time the Yellow River breached, it would overflow thousands of miles, and life and property would suffer the same catastrophe, and the national vitality would suffer great damage. Therefore, the Yellow River has the reputation of being "China's sorrow." Therefore, in the past, when the Yellow River breached, all the power of the world would be exhausted to block it. Therefore, in addition to having a dedicated river management agency, river affairs and water conservancy also became an important administration for the officials of all dynasties who governed the people. When China's war of resistance against Japan broke out, the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou in June 1938. For nine years, it has deviated from its original course, and the land and people have been immersed in disaster. Houses and fields have been destroyed, and the disaster is unimaginable. According to statistics after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the losses in the Yellow River flood area, only in the three provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, exceeded 13 million mu of cultivated land, and nearly one million people died. Those who did not die, the old and the weak were transferred to the ditches, and the strong were scattered in all directions, which is still incalculable. After the National Government returned, the Water Conservancy Commission and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) did their best to rescue the disaster and set up a blocking and restoration bureau, mobilizing a large number of manpower and technical experts, working hard day and night in the vast sandy wilderness, braving the biting wind, fighting the flood and competing with nature. The project lasted for a month, and finally celebrated its completion, since then the river flows eastward and returns to its original course. According to the Jinan telegram on the 20th, the headwaters of the Yellow River's old course have flowed through Shandong Province, and the Shandong people all have a feeling of reunion after a long separation. The refugees in the disaster areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu can also return to their homeland and be able to return to farming. Therefore, it is said that the Yellow River's closing project is not only a blessing for the people, but also a blessing for the country. At the same time, we also believe that the government has done a major event that will enrich the country, benefit the people, and promote benefits and eliminate harm after its return.</p>
<p>The most dangerous periods of the Yellow River are the peach flood, the summer flood, the autumn flood, and the ice flood. Before the summer flood last year, the closing project was about to be completed, but the Chinese Communist Party suddenly raised the issue, requiring the closing project to be suspended for five months, sitting and watching the failure of the project and the recurrence of the tragic situation. At the end of last year, the government and the Chinese Communist Party negotiated the closing project issue, but the dispute was not settled, and the Yellow River's ice flood had already arrived. The dispute continued until February this year, when Xue Dubi, the director of the Water Conservancy Commission, reached an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party that the dike restoration work in the downstream CCP area should begin immediately, and the water conservancy had subsidized 4 billion yuan for the downstream dike restoration project; the closing project continued as usual and was completed in mid-March. According to the fact that the ice flood period is in the second month of spring and the peach flood period is in April, the people in the 34 counties of the flood area and the agricultural water conservancy technical experts all believe that March this year is the last critical moment for the compatriots. Closing the breach means life, and not closing the breach means death. The Closing and Restoration Bureau has gone through hardships and planned to start closing the breach on March 6, but due to the collapse of part of Huayuankou, a dangerous situation of foundation sinking occurred, and it was postponed to the evening of the 8th to start closing the breach. Because the water was turbulent and the waves were surging, millions of people threw stones to block the breach in the nick of time, and the closing project was completed on the 15th; the water flowed into the diversion canal and followed the old course. The people are still celebrating this major project of promoting benefits and eliminating harm, but China has once again raised objections, thinking that this matter has not been discussed jointly; regarding this point, Xue Dubi has also replied to Mr. Eggerton, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China. This small aftermath is a regret. The responsibility of the government and the officials in charge is to create benefits for the country and the people for thousands of years. If they abandon benefits and seek harm, and sit and watch the arrival of the peach flood, disregarding the life and death of the people, it is reckless. But from this, we can know that if the country wants to progress and construction to succeed, it must be unified and stable; otherwise, the Yellow River will be allowed to flow east if it breaches in the east, and flow west if it breaches in the west.</p>
<p>Now that the Yellow River's closing project has been completed, and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee has also sent a telegram to commend it, we will be able to celebrate the tranquility of the river. We believe that this achievement cannot be diminished. We hope that the government will reward the employees at all levels of the closing and restoration project in practical measures, especially foreign experts and our country's water conservancy technicians, and should give generous awards to encourage them. Gu Tinglin said: "There is no difficult achievement in the world, it depends on the person." It must be known that the completion of the Yellow River's closing project has exhausted the brains of technical experts and the blood and sweat of millions of people, so rewarding merits can also encourage the development of the people's construction psychology, which is related to the future of national construction. What is even more important is that the people in the Yellow River flood area have endured hardships for nine years and are still displaced in the sandy wilderness. How to make them return to their homeland, how to make them resume cultivation, and how to exempt them from military service and taxes all need the government to make a quick decision and quickly plan for the aftermath. Do not let this large flood area remain barren, and do not let the vast number of people remain helpless forever. If we imagine that today, in the central part of our country, there is a desert and a picture of refugees, wouldn't it be an endless harm? Today, after we celebrate the completion of the Yellow River's closing project, we believe that the aftermath of the Yellow River flood area is imminent and we must plan good strategies! We must quickly plan for the aftermath! In this way, the government's administration can be considered to have a beginning and an end! The vast number of people are all looking forward to it, hoping that the government will take on this responsibility and build up this happy land in the Central Plains!</p>

<h3>Acting Secretary of State Acheson Clarifies: U.S. Aid Policy to Greece and Turkey; Does Not Believe This Move Will Cause War; If the Freedom of Greece and Turkey Collapses, the Whole World Will Suffer</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 20th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson provided supplementary opinions on President Truman's proposed aid to Greece and Turkey to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. The wording was very cautious and deliberate. It is said that aiding Greece and Turkey to fight against communism will not cause war, but the U.S. government believes that the situations in Greece and China cannot be compared. If the House Foreign Affairs Committee cannot make a decision quickly, countries resisting communism may experience a series of reactions unfavorable to the United States. Acheson then revealed the following ten opinions to reporters: (1) Of the $400 million requested by Greece and Turkey, $300 million will be loaned to Greece, and the rest will be loaned to Turkey; (2) Additional funds are needed to maintain the status quo in southern Korea, the amount has not yet been determined, and the rumor of $500 million is absolutely inaccurate; (3) The government does not acknowledge that the situations in China and Greece are comparable. The Chinese Communist Party controls a large area of China, with its own government and army; (4) The United States does not intend to re-organize elections in Greece; (5) Aiding Greece and Turkey should not be regarded as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine to the whole world. The United States aids Greece and Turkey at the request of the governments of those countries, and is not interference; (6) It should not be assumed that the United States will implement the same policy in other countries; (7) From an economic or morale point of view, if Greece and Turkey collapse, the Eastern countries will be greatly affected. It is not an exaggeration to say that the countries from the Dardanelles to the Chinese territorial waters are closely watching the outcome of Greece and Turkey; (8) The people of Europe are struggling to repair the scars of war and strive to maintain freedom and independence, and are also closely watching the situation in Greece and Turkey; (9) The United States does not intend to send troops to fight the Greek guerrillas; (10) The United States aids Greece and Turkey because it does not dare to risk waiting for the United Nations to take action. Greece and Turkey currently have enough funds to import major items for only 14 days.</p>
<p>Acheson's speech was carefully worded and he tried his best to avoid directly involving the Soviet Union, but when he solemnly replied whether the government's plan would cause war, the meaning was very clear. He said: "I don't think it will cause war." When asked whether Turkey could rely on the United Nations to guarantee its national integrity, Acheson replied: "If you were a Turk, you would know that the United Nations has no army, and you would have to hesitate again and again about relying on it."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 20th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson presented multiple alarming confidential documents to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today when he predicted that President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey would not cause a war with the Soviet Union, and distributed them to the committee members for reference. The document was in the form of a large loose-leaf notebook, explaining the background of the U.S. policy in the Mediterranean. Chairman Eaton of the committee advocated the publication of this confidential document, and four Republican members seconded it. Eaton told reporters: "The only way to deal with this document is to publish all the facts." Acheson will still attend the committee tomorrow to answer questions.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 20th Dispatch] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to begin hearing opinions on the aid to Greece and Turkey bill next Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Expand Foreign Aid: Labor Secretary Reveals</h3>
<p>[Associated Press San Francisco 20th Dispatch] Labor Secretary Schwellenbach stated in a speech at the Commonwealth Club today that the United States' aid to curb the development of communism may be extended to countries other than Greece and Turkey. Schwellenbach also said that President Truman firmly believes that if Greece and Turkey are not aided, the freedom of other countries will also tend to collapse, and communism will eventually dominate the world. Although Schwellenbach's words did not directly refer to the Soviet Union, the implied meaning is obvious. Schwellenbach continued: "Greece and Turkey may not be the only countries that actually need U.S. aid." But he did not specify which other countries they were. Before giving this speech, Schwellenbach had requested at a press conference that an amendment to the constitution be passed to outlaw the Communist Party in the United States.</p>
<h3>U.S. Seeks to Break U.S.-Soviet Stalemate in Korea; Plans to Establish Provisional Independent Government in South Korea; Policy Toward Korea to Undergo Thorough Change</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 21st Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, the military government in southern Korea is likely to be abolished and replaced by a provisional independent government in Korea. The current military governor, Hull, will be replaced by a civilian high commissioner. This is a thorough change in the U.S. policy toward Korea. When it will be implemented is not yet known, but according to various indications, it will probably be within a few months. Before Secretary of State Marshall departed for Moscow, it is said that he instructed the State Department to continue to explore the Korean situation and the U.S. policy toward Korea, with the aim of breaking the stalemate between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Korea. The changes currently indicated, if implemented, would show that the State Department has quickly implemented Marshall's instructions and decided on a new policy. Although officials have not expressed anything about this omen so far, it can be asserted that the U.S. occupation army will remain stationed in Korea for the sake of maintaining security. Whether Lieutenant General Hodge, who is now in the United States, will return as the commander of the U.S. forces in Korea is still a question. If the adjustment is implemented, the position of military governor currently held by Major General Lerch will be abolished. Regarding the scope of changes in southern Korea, there are various reasons to believe that the United States will grant the provisional independent government actual sovereignty, and will only be supervised by a high commissioner. It is also expected here that the State Department will ask Congress to discuss the Korean issue immediately after passing President Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey. The request will also include an appropriation of $200 million to deal with the military and economic situation in Korea. Once this new plan is implemented, it will be a complete victory for Syngman Rhee.</p>
<h3>American Observers Examine: Soviet Reaction to New U.S. Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow 20th Dispatch] There is now a tendency among some Americans in Moscow to believe that President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey, combined with the U.S.'s firm attitude at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, has caught the Soviet Union off guard and made it retreat in the face of difficulties. Some even say that this firm attitude of the U.S. has been effective, and the Soviet attitude has softened. However, as far as the United Press's Moscow correspondent knows, things are not really like this. First, the Soviet Union is not easily intimidated; second, the Soviet Union probably has a very proactive line that it is following, and the Soviet Union will never participate in any conference with a passive plan; third, the Soviet Union sees clearly the signs of the real danger at hand.</p>
<h3>U.S. Returns Keflavik Airport</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 21st Dispatch] The U.S. Army Air Forces has returned control of the Keflavik Airport to the Icelandic government, but U.S. military and civilian aircraft can still land there.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Reviews: Austrian Problem Report; Bevin Will Propose Organizing German Federal Government</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London 21st Broadcast: The four foreign ministers held their eleventh meeting today to hear the report submitted by the deputies' meeting on the Austrian issue.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London 21st Broadcast: According to well-informed sources, Bevin will propose that the future German government adopt the federal system of the United States and Canada. It is said that Bevin will make this suggestion after today's report from the deputies on the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty. The contents include a bicameral system and individual state governance, like the United States, but the executive power of the elected president is unique. It is expected that the United States and France will agree to this plan. The Soviet Union, which has always advocated the organization of a strong central government, is expected to oppose this suggestion.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tehran 20th Dispatch] A news agency quoted a dispatch from its Moscow correspondent saying that the four foreign ministers have agreed to allow Iran to participate in the German peace conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome 21st Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Italy will participate in the negotiations for the German peace treaty, but it is not known whether it will only submit a memorandum or actually send representatives to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>A Battle of Wits Between British and French Representatives</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 20th] At today's tenth meeting of the four foreign ministers, French representative Bidault stated that increasing the quantity of German coal exported to France was a prerequisite for France to accept German economic unification reparations and improved industrial standards. British Foreign Secretary Bevin categorically rejected this, insisting that Germany must have sufficient coal for its own industrial needs so that Germany can eventually become self-sufficient and not require supplies from Britain and the United States. This has caused the foreign ministers' meeting to once again reach an impasse. US Secretary of State Marshall requested an immediate discussion of a temporary German organization, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed it.</p>
<h3>Franco-Soviet Differences Not Entirely Resolved</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] French Foreign Minister Bidault told reporters at the French Embassy here this morning: My recent conversation with Marshal Stalin was broad in scope and harmonious in spirit. Unfortunately, the time was too short to clarify all the points of disagreement, especially the two sides' attitudes towards a federal Germany, which are diametrically opposed. There are rumors that I will hold another meeting with Stalin, but I have no such plans at the moment. Regarding France's request to obtain German coal, Britain and France discussed this when negotiating the conclusion of the alliance, and there was hope of reaching an agreement soon, but so far the opinions of both sides are still not close. Foreign Secretary Bevin's attitude remains the same as it was last November. I have explained France's attitude to the French National Assembly. In short, I have no intention of yielding.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Receives No U.S. Relief Funds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The U.S. State Department announced to Yugoslavia today that the proposed $350 million in foreign relief funds will not be allocated to Yugoslavia, as these funds will only be allocated to the countries most in need.</p>
<h3>British Troops Must Remain to Safeguard the Security of the Middle East and Far East - Alexander States to the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Defense Minister Alexander defended the government's defense plan in the House of Commons today, stating that the reduction of British troops at home and abroad will not be significant, and the conscription plan is necessary. The United Nations is still in its early stages, and major powers should not disarm. In the future, Britain does not intend to publish troop numbers, as the government believes that it is a mistake to implement pre-war public methods before an internationally agreed-upon policy of free exchange of information. The Middle East remains an important part of the British Commonwealth's security, and our country's legitimate needs in the region must be guaranteed. We do not intend to fully withdraw troops stationed in India before the end of June 1948. The Palestine issue has now been submitted to the United Nations for discussion, and British troops will continue to be stationed to maintain security until a resolution is reached. Alexander continued, stating that British troops will continue to be stationed in Hong Kong, Malaya, and other places, with the number based on the standard that their strength is sufficient to ensure the security and reconstruction of the area. The number of British troops currently stationed in Japan is limited, and the British troops in Indonesia have all withdrawn, he said.</p>
<h3>House of Lords Passes Motion Condemning the Government</h3>
<p>Economic Policies Deemed Inappropriate</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] The British House of Lords today passed a motion condemning the Labor government by a vote of 119 to 30, stating that it has not taken appropriate measures to deal with Britain's economic crisis. The voting in the House of Lords is different in nature from the voting in the House of Commons, so this condemnation will not lead to the overthrow of the Attlee cabinet, but only reflects the opinions of dissatisfied opposition nobles in the House of Lords expressing their anti-Labor views. This is the tenth condemnation by the House of Lords in this session of parliament, and the most serious one.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Facing Major Crisis - Ramadier Has Notified the President to Seek a Successor - External Representatives Dispatched to Welcome Bidault Back Home</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 21st Broadcast: French President Auriol is making a final effort with the leaders of various parties to save the current political crisis and prevent the government from collapsing, but unless there is an unexpected miracle, its collapse is almost inevitable. After meeting with the leaders of various parties, Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a speech at the Socialist Party Congress, saying that compromise is not yet hopeless.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] France is once again facing a new cabinet crisis. It is heard that Prime Minister Ramadier has stated that if the Communist Party does not trust the government's Vietnam policy, he will resign. Communist leader Duclos has announced that the party will refuse to support the Vietnam military expenditure bill. With Parliament in this "showdown" situation, the bill has been postponed for further discussion until the 22nd. Ramadier has submitted a final notification to President Auriol, and according to the constitution, the president should seek a successor for prime minister. It is heard that Auriol is eager to find some basis for a reconciliation between the four parties to avoid the government breaking down due to anti-communist tendencies, which may lead to more serious consequences, even causing a general strike, which is also possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] French President Auriol consulted with the leaders of various political parties on the 20th to seek a compromise solution to the political crisis. Among the political party leaders who met with President Auriol was former Prime Minister Blum. There are rumors that if the Ramadier cabinet collapses, Blum may be invited again to form a purely Socialist Party government. The Communist Party's parliamentary group convened a meeting today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The French Foreign Ministry announced that it has dispatched representatives to Moscow to await in case of an emergency, so that Bidault, who is participating in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, can be quickly brought back to France.</p>
<h3>The Socialist Party Attempts to Avert the Crisis - Decides to Change Vietnam Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The Central Committee of the French Socialist Party held a meeting yesterday and passed a resolution advocating that military measures in Vietnam should be limited to those necessary for maintaining security, and that negotiations should be conducted with representatives of the Viet Minh authorities at an opportune time. Both sides could implement a mutual ceasefire, and appoint officials who are committed to republicanism and democracy, etc. It is noted that the Communist Party's refusal to vote on the Vietnam military expenditure bill has led to the possibility of a cabinet crisis, so the Socialist Party passed this moderate resolution, aiming to prevent the current four-party coalition cabinet from breaking down.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Representative in France Suddenly Arrested and Imprisoned</h3>

<h3>U.S.-Soviet Confrontation - Japan's Position is Extremely Important</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] State Department officials today unanimously believe that although MacArthur has proposed an early completion of the peace treaty with Japan and the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the U.S. defense line has encircled the world from China, and the Pacific section is particularly important and there is no intention to weaken it. Acting Secretary of State Acheson has stated that due to technical reasons, the peace treaty with Japan had to be postponed, but in fact there are other reasons. The Soviet attitude now forces the United States to not only not relax, but even tighten its defense line. This line of defense, which the Soviet Union calls "encirclement," was an inaccurate term at the time, but is now becoming a reality. The U.S. and the Soviet Union face each other in Korea, Japan, the North Pacific, and Alaska. The recently signed U.S.-Canada joint defense agreement has completed this ring, from Greenland, the Kuril Islands to the U.K., and from Germany to the Mediterranean and Italy. Congressional action in the coming days is expected to link Greece, Turkey, and Iran. The U.S. has long encountered Soviet influence in Iran, and to some extent, has made it yield. Afghanistan, a buffer state between India and the Soviet Union, is not a true outpost, but the U.S. has considerable influence there, replacing Britain's original position to resist the Soviet Union. This line of defense is both political and military in nature, and is now mostly political in nature. Although the U.S. should remain in Japan for a long time to ensure its democratization, the Japanese islands are in the same position militarily in relation to the Asian continent as Britain is to the European continent. As long as Asia and Europe have the potential to trigger a world war, Japan, like Britain, will never lose its importance to U.S. national defense.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Philippine Military Agreement Formally Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 21st] The U.S.-Philippine military mutual assistance agreement was signed at 8:45 a.m. on the 21st at the Malacañang Palace in Manila, with Roxas and McNutt representing the two countries. It stipulates that the United States will send a military mission of 58 officers to guide the Philippine army and navy, and provide military equipment, including 83 ships. The agreement is revised every five years.</p>
<h3>Two Secretaries of the Pope Pass Away</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vatican City, 21st] Monsignor O'Connell, the Pope's private secretary, passed away suddenly this morning at the age of 79, only a few days after the death of his colleague Prince Colonna.</p>
<p>U.S. National Brookhaven Laboratory. This laboratory is jointly operated by nine famous universities in the east, funded by the government, and specializes in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. (Special dispatch from the New York Times)</p>
<h3>U.S. Advocates Early Consultation on Draft Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] According to government sources today, the State Department plans to consult with other countries on the drafting of a peace treaty with Japan in the near future. Government officials denied that this decision was due to MacArthur's recent statement, but pointed out that when Wenceslaus, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, recently returned to the United States, the authorities informed him of this decision. Presumably Acheson has relayed this decision to MacArthur, so MacArthur issued the statement. The question now is which countries can participate in the drafting of the peace treaty, and which countries have the right to review it. Although U.S. officials hope that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should all participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet Union will definitely oppose it. It is generally believed that the peace treaty with Japan will likely follow the precedent of the European peace treaties, with only four or five major countries undertaking the drafting of the peace treaty, and the remaining countries of the Far Eastern Commission reviewing it. Officials here also believe that after formal discussions begin, the completion of the peace treaty with Japan will take nine to twelve months.</p>
<h3>Security Council Meets to Discuss Corfu Channel Mine Incident - Two Blocs Confront Each Other, France Remains Neutral</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: When the United Nations Security Council resumed discussion of the Corfu Channel mine incident today, Albanian representative Kapo reiterated that the Albanian government does not acknowledge prior knowledge of the existence of the mines. It is reported that the opinions of the representatives of various countries on this issue are divided. The representatives of the United States and four other countries are prepared to support Britain's accusations that the Albanian government deliberately planted illegal mines, destroying two British destroyers and killing 44 sailors. France and Syria remain neutral, or will abstain. The Soviet Union and Poland support Albania, arguing that Britain's accusations cannot provide evidence. Britain expects the Soviet Union to veto any prosecution by the Security Council, so it has suggested that the case be transferred to the International Court of Justice for handling.</p>
<h3>Various Spanish Parties Plan Restoration - Guerrillas in Mining Areas Are Quite Active</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lisbon, 20th] It was learned here today that the Spanish Royalist Party, Conservative Party, and Catholic Party recently held several important meetings in Estoril. Former King Don Juan also participated in the meetings. The meetings decided to discuss the restoration with the exiled Republican government. The suggestions and resolutions of the meetings will not be made public, but will be sent separately to the Royalist Party and the Catholic Party in Spain, emphasizing the need for a consensus when rebuilding the empire and establishing a government recognized by foreign countries. Don Juan decided to restore the empire after a referendum, and to cooperate with a freely elected parliament to rule Spain in accordance with the provisions of the liberal constitution.</p>

<h3>Public Assets of Former Two Concessions Illegally Sold by Puppet Government - Municipal Council Meeting Passes Resolution to Reclaim Them All with Public Announcement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The illegal sale of public assets of the former two concessions in this city by the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. The Municipal Council meeting has now resolved that a public announcement will be made to reclaim them from today, and they will be included as municipal public assets. The title deeds left outside will also be declared invalid by public announcement. Regarding the public assets illegally sold by the puppet municipal government, the Land Bureau has completed the investigation based on relevant archives. Most of those belonging to the former Public Concession were purchased by Japanese enemies. Except for a part of the 13 plots of land at No. 18 Zezu, Map 5 in Huangpu District, all are now taken over and used by the Health, Education, and Public Works Bureaus. The bureau has sent a letter to the former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, asking them not to treat them as enemy property for disposal. Those belonging to the former French Concession were all purchased and resold by Yongfeng and Xinhe companies. According to the regulations on clearing land rights in recovered areas promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the above-mentioned public assets are all invalid. The Land Bureau specially submitted this to the Municipal Council meeting yesterday, which was passed.</p>
<h3>Stipulating Three Principles - Stall Locations - 353 Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to take into account the livelihood of the common people, the Municipal Council passed a motion at its second general meeting, "Please the Municipal Government to promptly designate stall locations," which was sent to the Municipal Government for handling. After receiving the order, the Police Bureau convened a meeting with the Public Utilities Bureau and representatives of the Municipal Council to discuss and determine three principles: (1) The area occupied by each stall should be limited to 4 Chinese feet in length and 3 Chinese feet in width. (2) Stalls are not allowed during the day in the Huangpu and Laozha districts. Stalls are allowed on non-traffic roads and in various alleys, provided that they do not hinder traffic and fire prevention. (However, the establishment of stalls in alleys must obtain the consent of the residents, and the Police Bureau must investigate and confirm that it does not hinder traffic and fire prevention). (3) The 353 stall locations in the city originally surveyed by the Police Bureau are still appropriate and do not need to be changed. This was passed at the 70th Municipal Council meeting yesterday and sent to the Municipal Council. The location of outdoor vegetable stalls must be designated.</p>
<h3>Barber Stalls Not Allowed in Huangpu and Laozha Districts</h3>
<p>The location of outdoor vegetable stalls must be designated.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Council meeting decided yesterday that barber stalls are not allowed in the Huangpu and Laozha districts of this city. Barber stalls are also not allowed along the roads in other districts, but a part of the open space in the stall concentration areas is allowed to be designated specifically for barber stalls. In addition, the vacant spaces in the fixed vegetable markets should be used as much as possible to absorb vegetable vendors to move in. Outdoor vegetable stalls should be moved to nearby open spaces. If there is indeed no open space there, the Police and Health Bureaus may designate stalls to be set up on wide roads more than 300 yards away from the vegetable market, provided that they do not hinder traffic.</p>
<h3>Shangsong Line Ferry Increases Prices - Residents of Pudong Request Correction</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Residents of Jinjiaqiao Town, Pudong, Zhou Mo, etc., recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, stating that the Shangsong Line ferry has increased prices in disguise, and requesting a prompt correction. Their reasons are roughly as follows: The ticket price for the Shangsong Line ferry from Shanghai to Qingning Temple was originally 500 yuan for second class, 1,000 yuan for first class, and 1,500 yuan for special class. However, starting from February 26th, a fuel surcharge of 10% was suddenly added to the ticket price. This move is obviously inconsistent with the emergency economic measures announced by the government on February 17th. The workers residing in Pudong are deeply affected, so they request that the Municipal Government be ordered to correct this.</p>
<h3>Preparations Underway for Branches of the Local Autonomy Society</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Li Zonghuang, the person in charge of the China Local Autonomy Society, recently sent a letter to Speaker Pan Gongzhan, inviting him to be the preparatory director of the Shanghai branch of the society, with Zhang Xiaosong and Xiang Changquan as vice directors, and Wu Kaixian, Wang Jiashu, Zhu Wende, Wang Xianqing, and ten others as preparatory members.

<h3>The District Procuratorate Decides Not to Prosecute the China National Aviation Corporation Crash in Western Hubei - Investigations by All Parties Determine That It Was Beyond Human Rescue</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After China National Aviation Corporation's C-46 No. 145 passenger plane on the Shanghai-Chongqing route crashed in Tianmen County, Western Hubei on January 28th of this year, rumors spread that the cause of the crash was that the screws of a certain important part of the plane were removed, or that 200 bars of gold were smuggled in the wings, causing the plane to lose balance and crash. The District Court of this city believed that since the plane took off in this city, if the above-mentioned criminal acts occurred, they should be under the jurisdiction of the court in this city, and assigned Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi of the District Procuratorate to be responsible for the investigation. Prosecutor Liu believed that Wu Shi (American), director of the Aviation Group of China National Aviation Corporation, and Deputy Directors Chen Hongsi and Wang Zhu were responsible for the command and supervision of aviation matters. They were responsible for the overall inspection of aircraft parts and personnel before each flight, as well as the verification of intelligence on obstacles encountered en route. If the aircraft crashed and a dereliction of duty was found, the aviation director should be held criminally liable, so the prosecutor interrogated Wu Shi, Chen Hongsi, and Wang Zhu. According to Wu Shi, the plane was thoroughly re-inspected before takeoff, and it was not found that "the screws of important parts were removed." There were no gold bars in the wings except for the fuel tank. He especially emphasized that even if the plane carried 70 kilograms of gold, it would not cause the plane to lose balance, and even if the plane lost balance, it would not crash. According to the investigation report from the company's Hankou office, the aircraft parts were normal and the weather was good when the aircraft took off from Shanghai to Hankou and from Hankou. According to an expert investigation report, the cause of the crash was a fire in the left engine, which burned off the left wing, and the pilot did not have time to land, resulting in the crash. This kind of accident was beyond human rescue and could not be foreseen. It was inevitable and almost certain. Therefore, the responsible positions of Wu Shi and the other two were not negligent. In addition to separate administrative procedures for the supervisory failures, it is difficult to impose criminal liability for negligent homicide. Therefore, in accordance with Article 231, paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute was made.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation to Conduct Second Test Flight on U.S.-China Air Route</h3>

<h3>Unemployed Soldiers of the Four Banks Warehouse Find It Difficult to Obtain Dock Work</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The soldiers of the Four Banks Warehouse requested to be assigned dock work to maintain their lives. The Shanghai Port Affairs Committee previously resolved that the soldiers should first compile a list, which would be verified by the Municipal Government. After verification, the Social Affairs Bureau would convene various dock companies to coordinate their placement. Before they have work and for the elderly and infirm, the Municipal Government will be responsible for relief. A reporter visited Deputy Director Li of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to him, there are many difficulties in placing the soldiers of the Four Banks Warehouse in dock work. In fact, it is feared that the dock companies will find it difficult to accept them. The Municipal Government has telegraphed the Central Government to seek other relief measures.</p>
<h3>Workers of Nine Electric Bulb Factories Petition the Social Affairs Bureau Again</h3>

<h3>Suspected Traitorous Tobacco Merchant Scheduled for Sentencing on the 27th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The case of Shen Weiting, a major tobacco merchant in Shanghai, accused of being a traitor, was concluded yesterday at the High Court, with sentencing scheduled for the morning of the 27th. According to the indictment from the High Procuratorate, the defendant had been engaged in the tobacco industry in Shanghai for more than 30 years. Since 1934, he had served as the chairman of the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Trade Association. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, the association was reorganized into the "Shanghai Special City Cigarette Industry Association" by order of the puppet regime, and the defendant continued to serve as "Chairman of the Board of Directors." Later, he was appointed as "Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Central China Tobacco Allocation Cooperative" by the puppet regime. During his tenure in the puppet position, he was used by the enemy to harm the people, and the list of his crimes is endless. After the victory, he was reported by Xu Liusheng, arrested, and brought to justice. Shen claimed during yesterday's interrogation: "In order to maintain the overall tobacco industry in the city, I had no choice but to take on the puppet position." He also hired a lawyer to defend him.</p>
<h3>Yu Hualong Still Sentenced to One and a Half Years, Can be Released in Another Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yu Hualong practiced law in Shanghai before the war. During the period of the enemy and puppet regimes, he served as the Deputy Director of the Puppet Baojia Committee, and was therefore reported as a suspected traitor.

It is reported that Yu Hualong has been arrested for more than a year, and his sentence will expire in another week, so he is expected to be released from prison.</p>
<h3>Zhu Yicai Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment, Jiang Yuliang Two Years and Six Months</h3>

<h3>Zhou Gengsheng Died in Prison, High Court Summons Witnesses, Source of Strange Note Still Unknown</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Zhou Gengsheng, a suspected traitor, also known as Zhou Gengsheng or Zhou Kui, 35 years old, from Rufou, Jiangsu, died in the High Court detention center. A "strange note" was found in his pocket, demanding 35 gold bars. The High Court paid close attention to this matter. Yesterday afternoon, the co-defendants Kan Chunyang and Ren Tianfu, who were in custody, were interrogated, and witnesses Zhu Jinbang and Zhang Shuchun, representatives of the Railway Association, Zhou Hongye, Zhou's father, and Lin Yizhi, who was in the same cell, were summoned to testify in court.</p>
<p>Based on the consolidated statements of the witnesses, the background of the case was the competition for the contract for all loading and unloading work at the Rihui Port Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, because this contracting work had a very high income, so they spared no effort to compete. Before the war, Wolffolin was the contractor. When the war broke out, Japanese planes bombed Rihui Port Station severely, and Wolffolin was afraid and fled. Subsequently, Zhou Gengsheng, Kan Chunyang, Ren Tianfu, and others contracted the work, engaging in military transportation at the time, and were praised by the Railway Transportation Command. After the victory, Wolffolin still intended to contract the work and launched a denunciation.</p>
<p>Launched a denunciation</p>
<p>, before August of last year, there was a roster at the Transportation Department of the two Railway Bureaus. Among them, it was pointed out that Zhou Gengsheng and others were suspected of being traitors. Although the plaintiffs in this case were Quan Changsheng and Quan Senlin, the instigator was Wolffolin. As for Zhou's father, Zhou Hongye, he did not seem to know much about the "strange note." He arrived at court yesterday and stated: "After my son Zhou Gengsheng died, in grief and anger, I burned all the notes he wrote during his lifetime." Although Judge Qiu sternly admonished him, he avoided making</p>
<p>direct answers</p>
<p>. Lin Yizhi, who was in the same cell, said: Zhou was from northern Jiangsu, and I am from Hangzhou. Because our languages are different and he was sick, although we were in the same room, we never talked. After questioning up to this point, the source of the "strange note" is still unknown. In order to understand the situation of this case, the reporter visited the person in charge of the High Court detention center, who provided the following information. Zhou Gengsheng had suffered from heart disease for a long time. The detention center had asked a doctor from the prison hospital to treat him. Because of his heart disease, he could not be moved to the ward and died in his cell at around 4:00 AM on the 19th. At that time, the prisoners on each floor were</p>
<p>noisy</p>
<p>, and the order was disrupted. Later, 16 representatives were selected to present Chen, the warden, with demands for improved treatment. All of Zhou Gengsheng's letters and notes left after his death were presented to Warden Chen by the prisoners, so the source of this "note" cannot be speculated. In order to maintain prison discipline, the mail was suspended for one day the day before yesterday, and mail delivery has resumed as usual since yesterday. The issue of whether bail should be granted when the patient is seriously ill is not within the authority of this detention center, so the various speculations about this detention center are supported by facts, and we do not wish to make any further statements.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Hearing of the Fuxing Island Case of Stealing and Selling Materials, Four Defendants Vehemently Deny, Court Discussion Adjourned for Retrial, Niu Chunling Summoned for Confrontation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The District Court held the first trial yesterday morning regarding the portion of the Fuxing Island case involving the alleged theft and sale of enemy military materials. The defendants are Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui, who were prosecuted by the prosecutor. In addition to the four defendants, witnesses Wang Qianli, Han Shengrong, Wang Enqing, and Hu Genhua were also summoned to testify in court. According to the first defendant, Li Yunpeng, Chief of the Affairs Section of the Fishery Management Office of the Executive Yuan, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui were not introduced by him. At that time, Platoon Leader Niu Chunling of the Navy was responsible for security and other work on the island. As for whether Niu stole and sold materials on the island, he had no way of knowing. Although there were many materials left by the Japanese army on the island, as he was not in charge, he could not know the details, let alone obtain them. After Niu Chunling was detained, he did not go to visit him (according to the prosecutor's indictment, Li has admitted to visiting him), and he did not send gold bars or anything like that. The two bathtubs were discovered by worker Wang Kui when he was repairing water pipes, and they contained only dirt and no gold. The other three defendants also denied any collusion to steal and sell materials. During the court's inquiry, witness Wang Qianli stated that he was a specialist committee member and director of the technical office of the Agricultural Committee of the Executive Yuan, and also one of the defendants in the suspected case. The prosecutor believed that he had committed perjury, but due to the amnesty, he was declared not to be prosecuted. According to Wang, the four defendants in this case were all introduced by him. Li Yunpeng and he were 15-year-old friends, so it was clear that this case was not denounced by him. The prosecutor thought that he could not serve as the director of the Fishery Management Office, and therefore attempted to disrupt things, which was a misunderstanding. Because the position of director of the technical office was almost the same as that of director of the Fishery Management Office, or perhaps the prosecutor misunderstood the words of Xu Fuqi, the director of the Fishery Management Office, which contained a tendency to engage in infighting. He also guaranteed that Li Yunpeng was honest and had no corrupt behavior. Another witness, Han Shengrong, stated that he was a painter and knew Xu Guangcai. He bought lead sheets from Ma Jiliang through Xu's introduction, and he did not know that the lead sheets were stolen goods from Fuxing Island. He also did not know Niu Chunling at all. The court ordered that Niu Chunling be summoned from the Naval Military Law Office to confront the defendants, and adjourned the hearing for retrial. In addition to the original bail, the defendants Li Yunpeng and others each paid a written guarantee of 50 million yuan.</p>

Liang and others allegedly coerced former Customs Commissioner Bailicha and deliberately shielded him, and there were also allegations of collusion. The case was transferred by Jianghai Customs to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The investigation has now been concluded, and it is believed that there is no evidence of a crime by the 13 defendants, including Liang Huajie and others.

<h3>"Four Famous Mountains" Bandit Gang Trial Concluded, Liu Hangxia Claims He was Forced by Livelihood, Liu Huaide Does Not Admit to Being an Accomplice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The "Four Famous Mountains" bandit gang Liu Hangxia, Liu Huaide, and Zhang Zhiqing, after being prosecuted by the District Procuratorate, underwent their first trial yesterday morning. According to Liu Hangxia's confession, he used to be a clerk in the Aviation Committee. After losing his job, he resorted to theft for a living and committed six crimes successively. Liu Huaide confessed that he and Liu Hangxia were once colleagues and had worked in the Political Department of the 14th Army. He had also performed in the Youth Theater Troupe and was quite familiar with the artists who came to Shanghai from the rear. He met Liu Hangxia in Yichang, and they came to Shanghai together to seek employment, living together in the Huizhong Hotel. At first, he did not know that Liu Hangxia was making a living by stealing. He also said that he had never participated in theft. Liu Hangxia also pleaded to the court to consider his youth, give him a lenient sentence, and give him an opportunity to rehabilitate himself. After the interrogation by Judge Zhu Yuhuang, he adjourned the trial and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 28th. The portion of the case involving the defendant Zhang Zhiqing has been rescheduled for a separate trial because the criminal is mute and cannot be interrogated normally.</p>

Afterwards, neighbors accompanied the injured to Renji Hospital in the city for treatment, but both father and son were seriously injured, and the son was already</p>
<p>unclear in his speech</p>

<h3>Tea Merchant's Adopted Daughter Suddenly Runs Away, Neighbor Shelters, Dispute Arises</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Jin Di, 17 years old, also known as A Xiang, the adopted daughter of tea merchant Zhu Changqing at No. 30 Zhongshi New Village, Yuyuan Road, was originally from Ningbo. She was abducted to Shanghai at the age of 11 during the War of Resistance and was intended to be sold to a brothel as a prostitute. Because Zhu had no children, he bought her as an adopted daughter. Unexpectedly, the girl's temperament changed drastically since last year, and she became disobedient. On the 11th day of the first lunar month, she accidentally broke two glass cups and was scolded by Zhu several times, and then ran away. The neighboring Cao, Deputy Director of the Yuan, at No. 28 sheltered her because of her pitiful life experience and published a notice in the newspaper to sever the relationship with the Zhu family, and hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to ask the Zhu family to voluntarily abandon the contract of selling Jin Di. After receiving the letter, Zhu also hired lawyer Zhou Yongting to refute it, saying that the Zhu Jin Di had not reached adulthood and was obviously seduced into running away voluntarily. He also set a deadline for her to return home, otherwise he would investigate further. More than a month has passed since Jin Di ran away, and Zhu Changqing reported to the local police station and sent Jin Di to the China Relief Women and Children General Association for adoption.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Chest Pain</p>
<p>Wang Ming asks: I had an X-ray examination three or four months ago, and the doctor said that my lungs were good, but there was an old scar in the upper part of my left lung, and I should pay attention to rest. I have two questions: Please advise (1) I have never had lung disease, so why is there a scar on my lung? Is there a significant difference between early active pulmonary tuberculosis and an old scar when taking an X-ray? (2) Is the occasional chest pain related to this scar? (3) Due to work reasons, I cannot rest, what effective drugs should I take, is fish liver oil pills beneficial?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Based on your letter, it is best to take an X-ray photo, because fluoroscopy is still difficult to accurately diagnose. If the X-ray photo determines that there is no active tuberculosis, then the occasional chest pain is intercostal neuralgia. Multiple vitamin pills can be taken regularly.</p>
<p>(2) Multiple Diseases After Childbirth</p>
<p>He Qiren asks: My relative is 17 years old, female, married, and in good health. Unexpectedly, she had a difficult labor in June of this year, and the fetus was suffocated in her belly. Later, the child was taken out by surgery, so she could escape the danger, but her uterus was thus ulcerated, and she could not control urination, which was incessantly dripping, and there was also a vaginal flatus phenomenon, which was extremely painful. I don't know what disease it is, please answer.</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Your relative's disease must be thoroughly examined before a treatment plan can be determined, and surgery may be required.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Higher Education Department and Others Are Currently Discussing Streamlining Procedures for Applying for Publicly Funded Education and Changing the Application Time to Earlier</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Ministry of Education, considering that the laws and regulations for students in national schools applying for publicly funded education are overly complex, with more than ten types, including repetitions, temporary measures, and those that have expired, urgently needs to be reorganized and simplified. It has been decided that the Counselor's Office, the General Affairs Department, the Higher Education Department, and the Secondary Education Department will discuss the measures, with He Shijun, director of the General Affairs Department, as the convener. It is reported that the principles of the revision are to simplify the laws and regulations, streamline the procedures for applying for publicly funded education, and bring forward the application time, so that applications can be made after passing the entrance examination and being admitted. Currently, applications for publicly funded education must be made after enrollment, and often it takes one or two months to receive the funding, greatly affecting students' motivation to study. Therefore, the method should be changed to allow for earlier application opportunities. Many students are still hesitant.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Approves a Five-Fold Increase in Professors' Academic Research Funding</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The academic research subsidies for teachers at national colleges and universities have been previously approved, with 50,000 yuan for professors, 40,000 yuan for associate professors, 30,000 yuan for lecturers, and 20,000 yuan for teaching assistants. However, due to recent price increases and currency devaluation, these amounts are insufficient. To improve the quality of university education and stabilize academic research life, the Ministry of Education specially submitted a proposal to Chairman Chiang on the 6th of this month, requesting an additional amount. The standard is a uniform increase of five times the original amount, i.e., 250,000 yuan for professors, 200,000 yuan for associate professors, 150,000 yuan for lecturers, and 100,000 yuan for teaching assistants. The proposal has been approved by the Chairman, and a notification will be issued to all schools for application once the Executive Yuan designates the source of funds.</p>

<h3>Tsinghua After Restoration (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Mei Yiqi</p>
<p>The College of Agriculture was established last autumn, and it was difficult to find suitable buildings on campus. Fortunately, the Ministry of Education allocated the buildings of the Enemy Puppet-established Civil Engineering College (east of the Summer Palace) for repairs, which can be used temporarily.</p>
<p>The student dormitories, Xin, Ping, Shan, and Ming Halls, have a total of 568 rooms. Originally designed for two people per room, it is indeed more suitable for two people. However, due to the increase in students, they have been changed to accommodate three people, totaling more than 1,780 people. The rooms originally prepared for workers have also been occupied, and the crowded situation can be imagined by alumni who have lived in these dormitories. Jing Hall, the girls' dormitory, has a total of 68 rooms, originally for two people per room, and has also been changed to accommodate three people, totaling 200 people. For those who cannot be accommodated in the above dormitories, more than 50 boys are temporarily living downstairs in a hospital building, and 40 girls are living in Guyue Hall. As for the dormitory facilities, except for the iron beds, which were fortunately retained after several negotiations, all other furniture had to be newly made. Two hundred students from the preparatory class are temporarily living in the College of Agriculture. The problem of student dormitories will become more serious this autumn. If, as in last autumn, about 1,000 new students are admitted again, and only over 200 students graduate this summer, how will the increased 600 or 700 people be accommodated? In today's high cost of labor and materials, building additional dormitories will be impossible. Therefore, the only solution is to estimate the capacity of the existing rooms to accommodate the increased number of people and set a quota for admission.</p>
<p>The original School Affairs Office (Gongzi Hall) front section and Yichun Courtyard of the faculty and staff dormitories have been extensively renovated and are still used as dormitories for single faculty and staff. In addition, behind the gymnasium, the enemy built 36 bungalows, which are located close to the meteorological observatory and are commonly known as the Thirty-Six Quarters. Most of the rooms are still retained and used as dormitories for single faculty and staff. As for faculty and staff residences, the original three areas, North Courtyard, West Courtyard, and New and Old South Courtyards, can accommodate more than 140 families after repair and renovation. In addition, 40 small houses (Mingsheng Yincun) have been built south of the Xiaohua River, but they are still insufficient for distribution. This is because the number of departments and students in the school has increased in recent years, and the number of faculty and staff must also be increased accordingly. Moreover, the school is located in the suburbs, and if teachers are hired and have families, housing must be provided. If they commute to and from the city, it will not only affect teaching but also incur additional expenses, which they will be unable to afford with their meager income. This housing problem is a unique difficulty for the school.</p>
<p>The outdoor scenery of Tsinghua Garden seems to be the same at a glance, but the roads in each area still need to be repaired, and the ash and coal slag left by the enemy are still being cleared. Fortunately, all the trees in the school were not cut down by the enemy, but due to years of disrepair, some have died, and some have grown too densely and need to be checked and pruned. This will be carried out as soon as the weather warms up. It is hoped that by the time the flowers bloom in early spring, the gardens will be clean and tidy, and the streams and ponds will be clear, restoring the old appearance of the beautiful scenery of Tsinghua. When our alumni return to campus at that time, their first impression will be that the scenery is no different. However, the internal wounds are deep and huge, and it will not be easy to recover without several years of manpower and financial resources.</p>

Niu Tou Water Indigo 100 city jin pack was 1.85 million yuan per can, with many transactions.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Prices All Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, because the amount of 12-pound red dragon head fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company the day before was not much, the industry absorbed and pushed it up, and there were eats at 3,000 to 4,000 yuan above the listed price. Therefore, 12-pound dragon head fine cloth once quietly reached more than 157,000 yuan. By the time of closing, the actual needs of both local and customer gangs were not smooth, and the dyeing factories were waiting to see. As a result, it was finally down by a small 2,500 yuan from the previous day, to 155,000 yuan. Brands such as Blue Chicken, Blue Phoenix, Wufu, Yanghe, and Caiqiu also declined, from 1,000 yuan to 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The Shilim cloth customer gang showed sluggishness, and 190 Meitinglin also declined by a small 7,000 yuan. The prices of other bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Serge were also more down than up.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Express Five Opinions Regarding This Year's Tea Loans</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] This reporter interviewed a tea industry tycoon yesterday to ask for his opinion on this year's government-organized tea loans. He expressed five points: (1) It is proposed that the government determine in advance the maximum amount of foreign exchange that can be obtained after this year's tea export. He said: Last year's tea export resulted in only US$5 million in foreign exchange. The key is related to the slow organization of loans. Therefore, if you want to obtain more foreign exchange this year, tea loans must be organized on a large scale, and the procedures must be expedited. On the tea merchant side, it is estimated that if this year's tea can be exported according to plan, US$15 million to US$20 million in foreign exchange can be obtained. (2) It is hoped that tea loans can be issued at the lowest possible interest rate. He said: In Taiwan, the loan is only 6% per annum. (3) In order to prevent shoddy workmanship, it is hoped that the quality of tea should be raised to the highest possible standard. (4) Because labor is too expensive now, in order to reduce costs, it is hoped that within the possible range, the goal of tea mechanization can be gradually achieved. (5) In order to cooperate with various agricultural loans, it is hoped that tea farmers' production cooperatives can be widely promoted. In the future, the tea industry can lay a modern foundation through cooperatives. However, this requires long-term education and religious promotion. He finally said: Last year, the traffic China Farmers Bank and other banks organized tea loans, and the business was overly concentrated in Shanghai. Starting this year, it seems that the strength of branches in various regions should be strengthened so as to closely contact with tea merchants and obtain the greatest effect.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Conditions are Leisurely</h3>
<p>The domestic tea sales, which have been narrow for a long time, have still not improved. However, those who hold goods still do not show signs of panic, so although the situation is quiet, there is absolutely no sign of falling. As for the foreign tea market, inheriting the soft wind of the past few days, coupled with the general urgent need for funds, sellers continue to sell, and buyers take the opportunity to bully again, so the trend has not improved. In terms of price, it is still weak. Moreover, the transaction volume is not as active as in the past. The current sellers are again small about the future of the selling price, so they only choose those who need it and add a little bit.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Refinancing: The National Bank Decides to Expand the Scope to Support Production Enterprises and Exporters</h3>
<p>In order to support small and medium-sized production enterprises and exporters, the Central Bank launched commercial banks and firms last year to organize industrial and commercial loan syndicates to apply for refinancing and rediscount from the bank. As of now, a total of more than 9.9 billion yuan has been lent for this loan, and the Central Bank has handled refinancing and rediscount at 75% of the original loan amount. It is reported that: in order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan, the bank has decided to strengthen the implementation of the rediscount and refinancing methods, and the scope will be expanded. The loan targets are not limited to small and medium-sized factories, and large-scale manufacturers can also obtain the right to rediscount and refinance. Wherever there are factory cities in the country and areas where export materials are concentrated, rediscount and refinancing will be handled to serve as the last lender for various commercial banks and firms, and fulfill the responsibility of the bank of banks.</p>
<h3>March Yarn Purchase Price: The Executive Yuan Has Approved it at 3.15 Million Yuan Per Piece</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is confirmed that: The Executive Yuan has recently approved the price of cotton yarn purchased by the Cotton Control Commission in March. It is estimated that 20 standard yarns will be 3.15 million yuan per piece. In addition, the purchase price of cotton yarn in February, 20 yarn, has also been adjusted to 2.75 million yuan per piece (the originally set purchase price was 2.5 million yuan). The purchase prices of cotton yarn of other counts will be calculated by the Cotton Control Commission according to the calculation ratio set by the commission in January.</p>
<p>The factory-level negotiated price for private yarn mills to freely buy and sell, 20 standard yarns, has also been approved at 3.7 million yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Appetite is Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving from the north and south was about 8,000 stones. The market for japonica rice remained balanced and temporarily did not breathe, but the early thin rice of southern japonica was scarce and active, slightly tight, and the appetite for indica rice was very brisk, with prices rising by 1,000 yuan. White yuan was fair and right, and Xian yuan was similar.</p>
<p>The oil market was notified of rising prices from Qingdao, and the Guang and Yong gangs both accepted them, turning lively. Raw soybean oil all saw a rebound to 9,000 yuan, clear oil also joined 9,000 yuan, sesame oil rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and vegetable oil was firm.</p>
<p>The customer sales of bean cake remained leisurely, and the market stood flat. The supply and demand of flour remained stable, and there were no fresh changes in foreign-made flour. However, the lower-grade flour rose by more than 1,000 yuan due to the sauce garden's action.</p>
<p>The arrival and departure of soybeans were balanced, and soybeans and Dudou were still less glorious and disgraceful, but the departure appetite of Zha beans was very smooth, with prices rising by 1,000 yuan. Mung beans were flat and tired, while green beans were strongly absorbed by Shantou, and the steps rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red sorghum was sluggish and lowered by another 1,000 yuan. Broad beans were in a dull and flat situation, similar to wheat. Sesame foreign firms continued, and prices were firm. Raw peanut Southern Ocean search and purchase, rising slowly, continued to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Trade Measures: Add Item D Clauses</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee issued Announcement No. 10 yesterday, which stated: Now, we are amending the provisional measures for import and export trade, adding item D, which reads: (D) The embassies and consulates of various countries in China, and their diplomatic personnel, who need to import the goods listed in Annex (III) B and Annex (IV) due to official business or private needs, must send them to the Provisional Import Management Committee after being certified by the ambassador (or minister) of the country in China for the issuance of an import permit.</p>
<h3>Japanese Pharmaceutical Merchants Are Reviving: The Future of the Pharmaceutical Industry is Worrying: The Authorities Should Quickly Seek Ways to Save it</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to news from the new pharmaceutical industry in this city: The Japanese pharmaceutical industry has been organized from the ashes of the war and is preparing to compete in our country's market. To this end, the reporter interviewed Mr. Gu Kemin, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, to inquire about the actual situation. According to him: the rumors are true, and the future of our country's pharmaceutical industry will become more difficult from now on. Before the war, Japanese-made drugs were already rampant in the market, and our people were deeply affected. During the occupation, Japanese merchants, with their military support, were in a monopoly state. When victory came, the competitive situation was swept away, but due to political unrest and economic policy disconnection, the foundation of pharmaceutical factories was precarious. Fortunately, the loan was realized, and the end of the year was survived. Recently, the government adopted a protective policy to prohibit the import of Western medicines, which was expected to recover. However, pharmaceutical raw materials are also included in the prohibited cases, and there is no foreign exchange quota, and there is no way to purchase materials, so the weak pharmaceutical industry is again in a difficult situation, and the national economy and people's livelihood are extremely worrying. It is hoped that the transportation management authorities will do their best to support and prevent this national defense industry from continuing to fall. Japanese-made drugs were originally strong enemies for many years. According to the new pharmaceutical industry, the largest Japanese pharmaceutical factory, such as Yiyiye Co., Ltd., has widely issued commercial letters, requesting our country's pharmaceutical merchants to resume contact. It is expected that our dying music factory will be more affected by its competition. It is hoped that the Import Management Committee will pay attention to this situation, quickly improve the material purchase methods, and fundamentally save this endangered national defense industry.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Enterprise Company: Shareholders Throughout the Province</h3>
<p>Yunnan Enterprise Company was first created by Long Yun, the former chairman of Yunnan Province. Recently, the Provincial Government ordered that a shareholders' representative meeting be held on May 1 this year. All people in the province are shareholders, and each person contributes 5,000 yuan. The shareholder representative is one person per township, and then one county representative is selected from the township representatives to go to the province to participate in the shareholders' meeting.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Market is Soft</h3>
<p>Coal merchants have been busy with petitions and distribution of goods recently, and their economy and personnel are restrained, so the market transaction is extremely leisurely. Although the amount of bituminous coal distributed this time is small, the market has gradually become soft and flooded, and the market price continues to be weak. Bai coal, Tongdeli, Xiazi, etc. are also the same. Only Jiaozuo block has recently returned to the 1.4 million mark due to less supply.</p>
<h3>White Sugar is Tight Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market price became tight again, and the acceptance was stronger. Green sugar was soft, and Taiwanese red rose by another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The association's draw, spot 22 medium sand white 217,500 yuan to 8,000 yuan good, 4,000 yuan up, Peruvian fine sand immediate delivery 200,000 yuan, today's future 200,700 yuan to 210,000 yuan, next week one 200,300, 400, 500, 600 yuan. 211,000 yuan in the afternoon, 212,000 yuan next week Tuesday, the rise is nearly 10,000 yuan. Taiwanese red 149,000 yuan, 150,000 yuan, 148,700 yuan, rose to 153,000 to 4,000 yuan in the afternoon. 24 coarse white rose by more than 10,000 yuan, and the upper and lower fluctuations of 4 and a half cars of it were small, and 3 and a half cars rose by 10,000 yuan. The remaining local sugar was slightly looser, such as Tiqing at 130,000 yuan, Shunde Qing 127,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, and Diaoqing 123,000 yuan to 2,500 yuan, with 400 to 500 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil and Sausage Casings are High: The Export Future is Bleak</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The cost of Tung oil exceeds the foreign price, so although there are arrivals in various places, the cost does not match, and it is difficult to export. The New York price of sausage casings is equivalent to 6,567,000 yuan per barrel in national currency, and the Shanghai market price needs 7 million yuan, which is only enough to cover the cost. The export future is quite bleak.</p>
<h3>More Diesel Allocation</h3>
<p>It is reported that the market price of diesel has recently become sluggish. It is heard that after the exchange rate adjustment, the three foreign companies, Texaco, Mobil, and Asia, continued to sell in large quantities. At the same time, because the oil distribution of Sinopec has been ordered to end, and a new institution has not yet been established, according to the past regulations of the Oil Distribution Association, the amount of oil imported by the three companies must be reported to the association in advance, and designated limited sellers, and distributors are banned from selling. However, there is currently no control agency, so the three companies can freely sell to distributors, and the Sinopec business office continues to distribute diesel, resulting in a balance between supply and demand, and the market price is almost equal to the distribution price.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Trade Measures: Add Item D Clauses</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee issued Announcement No. 10 yesterday, which stated: Now, we are amending the provisional measures for import and export trade, adding item D, which reads: (D) The embassies and consulates of various countries in China, and their diplomatic personnel, who need to import the goods listed in Annex (III) B and Annex (IV) due to official business or private needs, must send them to the Provisional Import Management Committee after being certified by the ambassador (or minister) of the country in China for the issuance of an import permit.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Sales Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton mill stocks were particularly robust, and transactions among industry peers were also substantial. Wing On Textile Factory purchased 100 bales of Middling 1/8 cotton at a price of 9.9 million yuan.  Shen Hsin No. 1 Factory purchased 100 bales of Middling 15/16 cotton at a price of 7.8 million yuan, and also 167 bales of Lao He cotton. Shen Hsin No. 6 Factory also purchased 200 dan of Nantai Cang lint cotton at a price of 4 million yuan.  Among industry peers, there were transactions of more than 300 bales of fine short-staple cotton, as well as Tongzhou coarse cotton, Pudong Huoji cotton, and Nantai Cang lint cotton, each at 100 bales, so the market sentiment was quite firm.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Wax Production Area Reports Price Increases, Market Prices Frequently Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Sales of Sichuan wax have recently become sparse. Although the incense season is approaching and candle demand is increasing, Sichuan wax is very valuable, and many had already purchased enough at the end of last year. According to industry insiders: The production volume of Sichuan wax last year was average. Hankou and Chongqing, the production areas, frequently report price increases. The price in Hankou is 5 million yuan per dan, and the price in Chongqing is 4.5 million yuan.  The market price in this city yesterday for large rice-core cakes was reduced from 4 million to 3.6 million yuan per market dan, and medium-sized toothed cakes were priced at 3.55 million yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Longan and Lychee Tightening</h3>
<p>Since the decline in longan and lychee prices, market prices have diverged, so some freight forwarders are being conservative.  The market saw a turnaround yesterday. Mixed-grade large-sized longan rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and top-grade Yuan Rou (dried longan meat) also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Jinshan Yuanzhi (round lychee) opened at 428,000 yuan, Bianzhi (flat lychee) at 648,000 yuan, and Nuomizhi (glutinous rice lychee) at 1.72 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee as usual, selling a total of 2006 pieces, including 1584 pieces to manufacturers and 422 pieces of yarn. There were a total of 1201 applications, including 804 from manufacturers and 397 for yarn.</p>
<h3>Northeast Soybean Exports Controlled by the China Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>Regarding the export of soybeans from Northeast China, the Northeast Administrative and Economic Commission, in view of the fact that futures trading by merchants has caused prices to soar, increasing one to two times in a few days, is deeply concerned that rising soybean prices will stimulate the prices of other food grains. It has specially stipulated that the China Trust Bureau should sell the soybeans in a unified manner and restrict their prices before exporting them overseas to earn foreign exchange. The profit distribution is one-tenth for the China Trust Bureau's profit, and nine-tenths are returned to the National Treasury by the Economic Commission. Soybeans are also specifically designated as special products. General merchants who need to export must have the soybeans inspected by the Export Soybean Inspection Office of the Economic Commission and deemed to meet the standards before they are allowed to be exported. As for goods transported from within the customs, the Northeast authorities generally do not impose restrictions.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Shadows</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, it has been heard that wash sales by some securities firms have spread from stocks to public bonds. According to an official from a relevant authority: The discovery of wash sales in the bond market is indeed inappropriate. The wild fluctuations in the bond market are purely the result of artificial manipulation. He pointed out: Public bond trading in this city has a rather deceptive and conspiratorial nature. The reason is that the national bonds remaining in Shanghai could not be used to collect interest in the rear during the war, so the coupons up to the twelfth period have not yet been collected. Currently, bond market trading refuses to accept national bonds that have already collected interest in Chongqing, effectively reducing the circulating chips of the unified price; it also promotes the idea that Unified Bond C will soon pass a certain threshold, in order to achieve its goal of raising prices and deceiving retail investors. Even more strangely, even red lottery tickets that have already won are being bought and sold at high prices in the market.</p>
<h3>British-Owned Bus Company Declares Liquidation</h3>
<p>The former British-owned bus company had all of its vehicles, parts, equipment, etc., requisitioned during the enemy occupation. After the victory, the Enemy Property Administration only identified and returned more than ten vehicles, and most of them were damaged beyond repair and unusable. Moreover, the Public Utilities Bureau has already assigned vehicles to most of the routes it operated. Therefore, yesterday (the 21st), it formally announced its voluntary dissolution and liquidation. The liquidation office is located at Room 605, No. 1 The Bund. All rights holders and creditors can register for liquidation by April 15th, and any delays will be considered a waiver of rights.</p>
<h3>Batch of Trucks Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The British ship "Aungen Schette," managed by the shipping department of Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai from Karachi the day before yesterday, carrying more than 260 large trucks and more than 50 passenger cars. These vehicles are surplus materials left over in India and were reported and transported by the Relief Administration. The Zhongkai ship sailed south the day before yesterday, carrying more than 1,770 bags of beans and more than 41,000 pieces of bean cakes to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Macao Gold: Allowed In, Not Allowed Out?</h3>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the financial community, the authorities here are issuing import permits for gold indiscriminately, so that foreign gold arriving in Hong Kong is all transported to Macao.  When reporters inquired with the Director of the Hanmen Economic Bureau, he said: Macao has allowed the import of gold since November of last year, but exports are prohibited, and transshipment also requires a special application for a permit, and half of the gold must be left in Macao as a condition.  Currently, transshipment permits have been issued for the transport of approximately 600,000 taels of gold from Hong Kong to Mumbai, India; however, permits allowing transshipment to Chinese territory have never been issued.</p>
<h3>Industrial Oils and Waxes Sell Slowly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The inventory of Philippine coconut oil is exhausted, and imports have disappeared. However, due to weak soap sales in soap factories, actual sales are sluggish as a result. The market price remains stagnant at 430,000 yuan per dan, about the same as last year's 380,000 yuan per dan.  The arrival of butter from Bengbu is also scarce, with a price of 400,000 yuan per dan. The daily output of local butter is about 200 dan, but it has recently become scarce, and the market price is similar to that of Bengbu. Asphalt is in very short supply, because the prices in the production areas are already higher than in Shanghai, and adding transportation costs would make it even higher than the current price in Shanghai, so arrivals are scarce and actual sales are also slow, with no significant price fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Post-Liberation Yan'an: A Recollection of the Malan Battle</h3>
<p>— March 10th, Yichuan, Northern Shaanxi News, Our Correspondent in Shaanxi, Li Qing</p>
<p>Hu Zongnan's elite First Division, with the overwhelming force of a thunderbolt, entered Yan'an city, which He Long's troops attempted to defend, on the morning of the 19th. Without stopping, they immediately divided their forces into two routes to continue advancing, in order to cut off the fleeing Communist army's retreat and eliminate their remaining forces.</p>
<p>Yan'an was the Communists' old nest and the command center of the Communist army. Their attempt to invade was not a one-day event. The reporter's recollection of the Malan battle here has its own significance of learning from the past to understand the future, and it is not intended to be seen as something of the past.</p>
<p>Offensive Shattered</p>
<p>Last year, the Yan'an Communist army once occupied Malan Town, located in the southwestern corner of Yijun County, Shaanxi Province. At that time, the New China News Agency and the Communist Party spokesperson stationed in Nanjing repeatedly issued "war reports" with exaggerated claims. Since the beginning of this year, the Communist army, from this so-called "Malan City," the location of the "Guanzhong District Commissioner's Office," broke through the fortified lines and successively dispatched troops to invade southward, reaching the northern bank of the Jing River. On one hand, they tried their best to widen the gap and form a pocket-shaped area, including parts or large parts of Xunyi, Chunhua, Tongchuan, Yao County, and Sanyuan counties. The climax was the capture of Tongrun, only ten kilometers southeast of Fuhua county seat, in the early part of last month, but the county seat remained in the hands of the Nationalist army. Later, according to Communist army documents obtained, the purpose of the so-called "Chunhua Offensive" that day was to attack Sanyuan to the east. If successful, they would further threaten the northern side of Chang'an. However, this attempt was shattered: Not only did Tongrun, Liulin Town, and Malan Town be successively recovered by the Nationalist army, the threat to Chang'an was eliminated, and the pocket-shaped position north of the Jing River was resolved, but the surviving Communist army had to retreat more than a hundred kilometers north to the Ju River basin in the northern border of Yijun County, between Huangling (中部) and Fuxian.</p>
<p>Pocket-Shaped Position</p>
<p>To understand the importance of Malan, please first describe the boundary line between the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Nationalist army. The area controlled by Yan'an that belongs to Gansu Province at the end of last month was Huanxian, Qingyang, and Heshui counties (Note: Qingyang and Heshui counties were recovered by the Nationalist army at the beginning of this month), and the Nationalist army's defense line was roughly parallel to the east-west highway between Zhenyuan, Ningxian, and Zhengning counties; further east, it turned south into Ji County in Shaanxi. The boundary line of northern Shaanxi started from the vicinity south of the Fen River in the eastern part of the two counties of Yanchang and Yichuan, and from this starting point, it extended westward across the Luo River to reach the county of E; further west, it also turned south into a corner of the two counties of Huangling and Yijun. The aforementioned "pocket-shaped position" refers to the gap between Zhengning County in Gansu and Yijun County in northern Shaanxi as the "pocket mouth," and it developed southward into a pocket shape, with Malan Town located in the center of the "pocket mouth." The town has a population of less than three or four thousand and has no economic value. Yan'an's glorification of it as a "city" emphasizes its military significance.</p>
<p>Battle Commander Removed</p>
<p>The Communist army operating in this area had many units and considerable strength. Those that were discovered successively included the First Regiment of the First Garrison Brigade, the Second Garrison Brigade, the Second Regiment of the Third Garrison Brigade, and the Seventh Garrison Brigade, etc. In addition, it was heard that there was also a artillery force, all under the command of the famous Hu Liangjian (Hu had several brothers who also served as senior military officers in the Communist army). He once resisted in the east, west, and south directions, but the Nationalist army's attack was north of Malan, in order to seal the pocket mouth and turn the Communist army in the pocket shape into "objects in a bag." As a result, Hu was dismissed and transferred to another position due to the issue of responsibility for the defeat. His successor was Yang Zhengmin, the son of Yang Hucheng. From this personnel change, it should be known that Yan'an's view of the future importance of this area will only increase, not decrease.</p>
<p>After the Flames of War</p>
<p>Malan has undergone two wars, and the degree of cruelty cannot be imagined by those who have not personally visited the place. When the Communist army retreated, the people's food, clothing, as well as horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, pigs, and other livestock were all forced to be transported north. Demolishing houses and destroying homes was commonplace. Even small things such as pigsties, dog kennels, mangers, and even pots, bowls, spoons, and ladles disappeared! What did the people do to deserve such a disaster!</p>
<p>Yangjiadian and Liulin Town, dozens of kilometers southeast of Malan, were also once looted by the Communist army. After the retreat, a folk song circulated among the people. It is recorded below without changing a single word:</p>
<p>Folk Song</p>
<p>"The Eighth Route Army, like fish eggs, occupied every village in the border area. Yangjiadian, Liulinzi, overturning boxes, emptying cabinets, beddings, thread tassels, basins, chamber pots, large and small bundles, carrying everything. Hairpins, bracelets, earrings, quilts, doors, and windows. Baby clothes, diapers, tattered shirts, and torn pants. Chili noodles, magical medicine, leaving nothing behind, big or small. Burning houses, grass mounds, snatching things, tying up beasts. Kicking young wives, beating to death the babies in their arms. Cutting ears, cutting noses, pulling away the livestock and donkeys. Beating my eldest son, making him carry a bag of flour. Binding the people into a string, following the broken dolls in a chain. The Eighth Route Army soldiers surrounding them, driving hundreds of children to climb the mountains."</p>
<p>Alas! Even Avici hell cannot be more cruel than this. The Malan battle was resolved first, and Heshui and Qingyang in Gansu Province were recovered later. The southern boundary of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has now been completely changed. Today's gap seems to have shifted north to Heshui in Gansu and Ji County in northern Shaanxi. Future changes should be one of our points of attention. Naval Elder statesman Sa Zhenbing</p>
<h3>Visiting Sa Zhenbing at Zhuyuan: A Chat with the Naval Elder Statesman</h3>
<p>— Fuzhou, 13th Dispatch, Our Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>"Bodhisattva Sa" is a polite nickname given to Naval Elder Statesman Admiral Sa Zhenbing by the people of Fuzhou, and Admiral Sa is indeed worthy of it. Mr. Sa is kind, amiable, and approachable. He has dedicated his life to doing good deeds. Even young children in Fujian know about Mr. Sa. In terms of career, Mr. Sa has an inseparable relationship with a part of Chinese naval history. The admiral is 89 years old, a long-lived person and also a generation of heroes.</p>
<p>Heading Straight to the Admiral's Residence on Cangqian Mountain</p>
<p>It was a clear morning, and the reporter drove straight to Nantai, stepping onto Cangqian Mountain. This place is Fuzhou's "Shangri-La," with rows of Western-style houses and beautiful scenery. In the past, Westerners and consulates all gathered here, a residential area for foreigners, and the environment was quite Westernized. Cangqian Mountain has a racecourse, which is larger than the Shanghai racecourse. It was a place for foreigners to race and relax, and Chinese people were not allowed to enter. Cangqian Mountain was like Fuzhou's Public Concession. After the Anti-Japanese War, most of the Westerners returned to their countries, and Fuzhou's "residents" successively settled here.</p>
<p>Near the racecourse, there is a Western-style house, like an apartment in a Shanghai alley, with "Zhuyuan" (Bamboo Garden) written outside. It is said that Sa Zhenbing, the "General of Solemn Majesty," resides here. After being notified by the attendant, the reporter met with the admiral in his bedroom upstairs. The admiral greeted us with a smile. The reporter was concerned about his old life and first asked about his recent health. He said that he was old and the functions of his five senses were declining. Especially last year, he suffered from arteriosclerosis, often had asthma, and rarely went out. His daily life was taken care of by his family and attendants. The central government provided living expenses, and he rarely inquired about various changes in the outside world.</p>
<p>Forty Years in the Navy, Commanding the Fleet</p>
<p>When the reporter asked the general about his thoughts on the past, he said that he had been in the military for more than 40 years, and the vicissitudes of life were unavoidable. Mr. Sa was among the first students sent by the Qing government to study in the UK, specializing in the navy. After returning to China, he successively served as a navy guerilla-general, participated in the Sino-French War in Jiashen, was awarded the title of Grand General, assisted the Beiyang Navy, and was appreciated by the naval admiral Ye Zugui. Later, he was recommended by Ye as the Guangdong Navy Commander, commanding the Northern and Southern Navies. At the end of the Guangxu era, he was sent abroad to inspect the naval systems of various countries and gained a lot of experience. Later, he was promoted to Minister of the Navy. When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, Mr. Sa was assigned to jointly command the army and navy with Yin Chang, the then Minister of the Army, to suppress the rebellion southward. Sa was deeply influenced by revolutionary doctrines and inspired by the spirit of the Father of the Nation, so he led his troops to telegraph his support for the revolution, making a great contribution to the Xinhai Revolution. At the beginning of the Republic of China, he successively served as Chief of the Navy Department and Director General, and was honored as General of Solemn Majesty. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the political situation in Fujian changed, and Mr. Sa, due to popular support, concurrently served as the provincial governor. During his tenure, he put the people first, was loyal and diligent in political affairs, and was highly supported by local people and praised by the central authorities. Today, at the age of ninety, although he has long retired from military life, he is still hired as a senior advisor to the Naval Headquarters.</p>
<p>Good Harbors in the North and South, Naval Defense is Important</p>
<p>When the reporter asked the admiral for his opinions on building a new Chinese navy, he believed that China has a long coastline, and without a navy, it is not enough to be among the strong countries. Moreover, there are good harbors in both the north and south, providing a geographical basis for establishing a navy. Qingdao in the north is an ideal harbor. Keelung in Taiwan is a southern naval base. In Fujian, in addition to Mawei and Xiamen being able to become fortresses, Sanduo Bay in Fuding is a connecting point between the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang. The harbor is flanked by the Hengzhi Mountain in Nanguan, and its inner harbor is deep and surrounded by towering mountains on both sides. It is extremely strategically advantageous and can be used as a military port. Moreover, the water is deep enough to accommodate giant ships, making it a good naval base. Unfortunately, it has not been noticed by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The most important thing in building an army is talent, and the cultivation of naval talent is time-consuming and costly; it is extremely difficult, but for the sake of national defense, the government should do its best. Building a navy is not something that can be done in a day or two, and it requires a long-term vision. The UK places great emphasis on cultivating a kind of maritime spirit when training its navy, which is worthy of emulation. Currently, the training of our new navy is supported by the United States, and we are deeply grateful. However, we should especially have the spirit of seeking self-development, so that the new Chinese navy will become stronger and strengthen the power of national defense day by day.</p>
<p>What Does the General Hope For? Only Early Peace</p>
<p>Since last year, due to poor health, Mr. Sa has rarely interacted with the outside world. Every day, his relatives read the newspaper to him so that he can get a glimpse of current affairs. He asked the reporter about the development of the domestic situation. The reporter told him that the domestic war is currently concentrated in a corner of southern Shandong, and the war is fierce. The people in the north are in deep water and fire. The Communist Party is launching a rebellion, which is greatly harmful to the country. He believes that national strength is the most important thing. After a long war of resistance, how can we start a domestic war again? Only early peace can bring about national revival, otherwise the country will not exist. How can the existence of parties be allowed? From his words, the general's deep hope for peace can be seen.</p>
<p>Expressing Aspirations with Simplicity, Entertaining Oneself with Poetry</p>
<p>The general has held important military and political positions for decades, with clean sleeves and a desolate old age. His life has always been very frugal, like an ordinary citizen. He has always been compassionate, helping orphans and the poor. The general's only hobbies are writing poetry and calligraphy. During the Anti-Japanese War, the central government specially sent him to Nanyang to comfort the overseas Chinese, which was widely welcomed by people in the overseas Chinese community. After that, the overseas Chinese donated to support the war of resistance, and the general's actions were helpful. After completing the Nanyang mission, he went to Chongqing to report back to the central government, which was greatly appreciated by the central authorities. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly summoned him and offered his condolences. Afterwards, the general's footprints were seen in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Although he was in his seventies, he was energetic and able to ride a horse freely. His nearly three years in Gansu left a deep impression on the people of the Northwest. After the victory, the general returned alone. Last autumn, he suffered from arteriosclerosis, and his body became weaker day by day. He is recuperating in Zhuyuan. This generation of heroes has since retired to his hometown, until now.</p>

<h3>Voices of Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine School Students</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>We are students of the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine School. Our school has recently been ordered by the Ministry of Education to close again. This time, I am afraid that it is not like the previous time, and the closure will definitely become a reality. The closure of the school is of course closely related to us students. Some of us have come from thousands of miles away, and some of us have borrowed money to come here, full of hope, but a bucket of cold water is poured on us, how can we not be depressed!</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's reason for ordering the closure is that our school's funding, faculty, equipment, and curriculum do not meet the standards. It is true that they do not meet the standards, and this cannot be denied. Even we students feel dissatisfied, but where can we find a qualified traditional Chinese medicine school? If there is no place to find one, we have no choice but to choose a school that we think is relatively good and enroll in it. How wonderful it would be if the education authorities could run a qualified traditional Chinese medicine school! I believe that students from traditional Chinese medicine schools across the country would definitely come running. At that time, the non-standard traditional Chinese medicine schools would naturally close down without being banned. If the education authorities cannot run a qualified traditional Chinese medicine school, then the existing relatively good traditional Chinese medicine schools should not be banned. Not only should they not be banned, but they should also be given guidance to improve and meet the standards as soon as possible. Because the power of individuals is ultimately limited. Even if national universities are run with public funds, they still cannot be satisfactory in every way, let alone private ones, let alone our principal who makes a living from patients' medical records.</p>
<p>Some people say, "The Ministry of Education's resolute measures are implicitly telling you not to study traditional Chinese medicine." If traditional Chinese medicine can really be eliminated, then we will not study traditional Chinese medicine. But traditional Chinese medicine is not yet at the point of being eliminated. Any discipline in the world, when it has reached the point of being eliminated, will naturally disappear without a trace without the need for external force. The fact that traditional Chinese medicine has been repeatedly destroyed but still exists is clear evidence that it has not yet reached the time of elimination. Even if we take a step back, traditional Chinese medicine can be eliminated. Is it to be replaced by Western medicine? May I ask what is the equipment, performance, and medical ethics of most Western medicine? Can they shoulder this important task? Even if we take another step back, if every Western medicine is good, may I ask how many Western medicine doctors are there in the country? Are there enough to treat the people of the country? If not enough, how will we solve it? Even if we take another step back, if the number of Western medicine doctors is enough, may I ask if the Western medicine drugs used by Western medicine can be self-sufficient and self-supplied? No matter how you say it, traditional Chinese medicine is absolutely necessary to exist at present, and our school absolutely has value to exist. A school that has value to exist is forcibly closed down, how can we be convinced, how can this be what people attending the conference hope for? Gentlemen of the education authorities, I hope you will allow us to continue studying at our original school.</p>

<h3>On Handling Subject Matter</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Up until now, mankind has still been unable to live apart from the real world. Therefore, they have to deal with events and interact with people. In these ordinary things, people are often able to find some common feelings. After the writer collects these feelings, it is the so-called theme of literature. Therefore, as a worker of art and literature, the most fundamental condition is to experience actual life. Otherwise, works produced in a closed-door manner are impractical and cannot reflect reality, and their works will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Therefore, when collecting subject matter, one should experience it in the position of the person. For example, Cao Yu's "Sunrise," most people think this is a successful script. The author uses ordinary writing to depict the thoughts, opinions, and actions of people living in the abyss vividly. We see Chen Bailu in the play, knowing that she knows that living this way, like a monk striking the clock day after day, will not have a good ending, and the result is still to walk towards death? However, she is greedy for this material enjoyment, and she lacks the courage to leave this place and follow Fang Dasheng to the free world. Jin Ba, a social bully, has such a great potential power. The author can write these things so realistically because he has experienced them in reality before writing the script.</p>
<p>There are many, many such examples. In order to describe the thoughts and actions of girls, Balzac secretly peeped under the bed in his lover's room for a night. As a result, his lover found out about this matter, and when he asked her to marry him, he was sternly rejected by his lover for this reason. George Sand wanted to describe the life of a hotel waiter, so he worked as a waiter for three months. Their purpose is very simple, in a word, it is to express the people being described deeply and realistically.</p>
<p>As for "Youth Grass," which takes the conscription of 100,000 educated youth as the subject matter, it is really too unreal. Don't say that the author has not actually experienced it, simply put, the author has not even had a practical thought about it. Such works undoubtedly lose their value.</p>
<p>Literature belongs to the masses, it contains great educational significance, it can make people distinguish between right and wrong, and it can leave people with extremely deep impressions. Therefore, when collecting subject matter, it should not be hasty, and one should ask oneself, what kind of impact will this work have after it is produced?</p>
<p>Observation, comparison, and research are the indispensable means when collecting subject matter.</p>
<p>However, literary works have their own exaggeration. Within the limits of elasticity, it can help characters and events to make the expression clearer and more profound!</p>
<h3>The Sweet Fever</h3>
<p>— Wish</p>
<p>(It magically moves people's hearts, leading to ecstasy and disappointment.)</p>
<p>Male-Centered</p>
<p>The drake and the two ducks swam toward them – the drake, naturally, in the middle, handsome and pleasing, and a little farther off, the third duck continued her rejected and unconsoled courtship. Whenever she got too close, the drake charged at her, beak wide open, driving her back. Then she would pretend not to know where she was going, wandering aimlessly, dazed, gradually inching closer to the drake who rejected her. But this trick was wasted; he had already seen through it, and finally, he attacked this poor heartbroken duck with such decisiveness that she had no choice but to flee.</p>
<p>– George Moore (1851-1933)</p>
<p>I Married Milton</p>
<p>Later my husband came in and locked the door; and, the blinds were already closed, now it was just the two of us.</p>
<p>After I took off my clothes, I climbed into bed with the Bible in my hand. He kissed me gently and read a passage to me: Solomon praised the beauty of his mistress, comparing her belly to a heap of wheat and her breasts to two twin fawns. Then he closed the book, first placing a rose petal or two inside as a memento; he spoke sweetly to me like a lover, but in a foreign language, in a rough voice – I believe it was Syriac, or Aramaic. Later, I had to climb out of bed again, kneel beside him, and thank God for his endless grace: that he made one of us a man and the other a woman, and then he said a lot more. After saying "Amen," he hugged me back into the covers, holding me tight, trembling with intense passion. I didn't say anything, just lay stiffly, he lifted my head and said, "Ah, humble stubbornness! I praise you!" He offered a cup of wine to my lips. I took a sip, but although I had originally decided to please him, I couldn't be infected by his passion. After that, he flattered me like this: telling me the beautiful story of how he went to Italy to find a bride...</p>
<p>Besides "Oh," "Ah," "Humph"... how could I answer him, as he spoke, carefully and tenderly stroking the curls in my hair.</p>
<p>– R. Graves: "Milton's Wife"</p>
<p>Love Letter Dear Miss Kitty:</p>
<p>This is a love letter, I assume you can put it aside, and if you still feel like it's a love letter, then read it.</p>
<p>Of course, I could have kept the main points of this letter secret and said them when we meet next time, but there's always a chance I'll get run over by a car. So, that's my motivation for writing.</p>
<p>After you left that day, I stared blankly at the heather in a daze... so my thoughts coalesced like this – Miss Kitty is someone I love, admire, someone who can make me happy and someone I can trust. We are neighbors, and I feel great comfort and deep pride in this. If I had actually said to Miss Kitty: "How deep... how great...", she would have been dumbfounded with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Well, goodbye. See you at the theater.</p>
<p>– A. Vogt: "Letter to K (Kennerly)"</p>
<p>Equilibrium</p>
<p>"Some stallions get crazy as soon as they see a mare," Forrest said... "But this Hollywood horse – he was great! They pulled him into the stable, he didn't shrug, didn't jump, didn't kick, nothing. But he was very excited. He stood there watching her; you could see the sides of his chest going up and down, faster and faster, more and more violently, his eyes flashing – tense and fierce. He was having trouble breathing – you could even see the muscles under his gray horse blanket strong and firm. He was a real beauty!</p>
<p>"She knew he was there," Forrest said, "she knew, she just neighed a little, a soft whinny. Then she shivered all over, shaking from side to side all the way down to her hooves.</p>
<p>"He snorted loudly from his nostrils, then, as the grooms led him around her four times, he lifted his feet high. When he walked in front of her, he snorted again, shaking his head, shaking his mane. God, it was beautiful! He was showing her off: how good-looking he was. And it was true, look, as I watched him, he strutted there, shaking his head, breathing fire, eyes shining, showing how really impressive he was...</p>
<p>"He circled her body three times... he was trembling. And she was ready. It seemed that since he had assured her again like that, her doubts were gone. She was no longer afraid." -- Sweet, Longstreet. "Stallion Road" (Translated from Argosy-jan.1947)</p>
<h3>Autumn Woods Walking at Moonrise</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhengbai</p>
<h3>Sail</h3>
<p>— Mengnong</p>
<p>With wind, there would be no sail in the world, the situation being just like there would be no lighthouse without a sea ship.</p>
<p>Whether the wind comes favorably or unfavorably, the sail is not afraid of the wind. It will embrace everything and raise a song of joy, while it will endure all the tossing, contracting and expanding freely.</p>
<p>When wine-like spring wind blows, it becomes intoxicated in the spring wind. When tea-like summer wind blows on its body, it feels light all over. When smoke-like autumn wind comes, it naturally returns to tranquility. When ginger-like spicy winter wind blows on its body, it will also grit its teeth, endure hardship, endure the difficult times, await temporary rest, and prepare for eternal progress.</p>
<p>With this kind of heart, the sail becomes heroic and resolute. The invasion of storms and rain inevitably loses the opportunity to wreak havoc on the sail.</p>
<p>I love listening to a beautiful song sung by a great exiled poet Lermontov, piercing like an arrow into the depths of my heart, making a permanent echo:</p>
<p>On the misty sea with green waves, a lonely white sail is drifting, is it seeking something in a faraway country? Is it abandoned by its homeland for something?</p>
<p>The wild wind howls, the waves surge, the mast bends and creaks and groans. Ah! It is not pursuing happiness, nor is it suffering from the turbulence for happiness.</p>
<p>Underfoot, trampling on green waves brighter than the blue sky, overhead, golden sun flashing, but the fanatical sail yearns for a storm, as if only in a storm can it obtain a moment of peace!</p>
<p>Truly, let this sail that dares to move forward follow the new generation and stride forward!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 203</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As he was busy taking notes, the voice in the drawer rang again:</p>
<p>-You said this side is your responsibility, what does that mean? - Tsurumi's voice.</p>
<p>-I'm afraid that female rogue will really turn hostile... and search - Pingzi spoke.</p>
<p>-Why are you afraid of her searching? - Tsuru.</p>
<p>-I have a friend here! - Ping.</p>
<p>-Ha... who? - Tsuru.</p>
<p>-Miss Liu - Ping.</p>
<p>-Miss Liu Shi - Ping.</p>
<p>-Haha, you're playing tricks again! - Tsuru. (Because Pingzi also has a Chinese name called "Liu Shi").</p>
<p>-I'm definitely not playing tricks, she's a pitiful child who is both loyal and filial, risking her life to help her father, working for the Koreans. - Ping.</p>
<p>-When did you meet? - Tsuru.</p>
<p>-Yesterday. - Ping.</p>
<p>-Who introduced you? - Tsuru.</p>
<p>-Teacher Aoki - Ping.</p>
<p>-Elder Aoki introduced you to a Korean revolutionary party?</p>
<p>-That's what Master Nishihara wants, and it's also the grand purpose of our Aoki line... willing to let Korea be independent. But Korea is a lazy elephant, and needs an elephant trainer to train her, supervise her; then they can become friends. - Ping.</p>
<p>-Speaking nonsense in broad daylight! If you want people to be independent, but you want to lead them by the nose and follow you, what kind of independence is this? - Tsuru.</p>
<p>-This is a major national matter, I'm sorry I don't understand it very well... Maybe if we don't lead them, others will lead them! - Ping.</p>
<p>We were just listening to this when there was a light knock on the door, and Jiqun walked in, dressed in a different outfit; trousers, shirt, with a cap in her hand, and the rest of the decoration was her "hundred-pocket bag" and holster. In the instant of pushing open the door and sweeping her eyes, she already knew what was going on in the room, so she stepped in lightly, smiled naturally at us, gave a sweeping military salute, in a charming and vigorous posture, and then walked to my side and sat down.</p>
<p>"Where's Little Tiger?" I whispered to her.</p>
<p>"In the hall... he hasn't forgotten those snacks." Yaoqun told me with a smile in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Where did you chase back from?"</p>
<p>"The mouth of Jiaomin Lane." Yaoqun said here, noticing the sound in the drawer, "But is it hearing the Tokyo broadcast?... Why does it sound a bit like Mr. Gu..." Yaoqun didn't understand Japanese, and thought the person broadcasting sounded like Tsurumi.</p>
<p>I quickly told her the situation here, while translating the listening words for her:</p>
<p>-There's no need for a surprise attack, when I came here, they had already released all the Chinese people locked up according to Tokyo's orders... there's even less need for demonstrations; I don't think it's meaningful. I think it's best to lie low for a while at this time, to coordinate the counter-attack, and sprinkle some useful blood on more meaningful work. - Ping</p>
<p>Hearing this, I suddenly felt uneasy, thinking that Tsurumi shouldn't have told Pingzi about our plan for a surprise attack. Unfortunately, when Yaoqun and I were talking, we didn't hear what Tsurumi and Pingzi were saying, and we didn't know how they suddenly went from the Korean issue to the surprise attack issue.

<h3>Ode to the North Window</h3>
<p>— Jin Yueting</p>
<p>Many people have praised windows beautifully. They use it to metaphorize the moving and bright eyes of a beauty, saying: the eyes are the windows of the soul. Now I want to say: the window is the eye of the house, and the curtain is its eyelash.</p>
<p>Think about it, a house without windows; pitch black and damp, with moldy air. Even a person full of vitality, will become dull and restrained once they live there, like a prisoner just entering prison.</p>
<p>The window makes the person in the house live together with the world, giving them many beautiful things to see, and many wonderful sounds to hear. It makes them live, and this life is as harmonious as a musical rhyme, and as clear.</p>
<p>I praise the window because I have a window, and this window faces north.</p>
<p>When we first moved into this small house, the neighbors and friends all sighed for our bad luck, saying: look at this north-facing window. The winter in the north can't compare to the warmth of Jiangnan, the wind and snow will come in from the window and we won't be able to bear it.</p>
<p>We have to bear it even if we can't bear it, because we were assigned to it. We started to comfort ourselves, saying that although the window faces north, it is still a window after all. Any window can make us live happily, south-facing is of course good, but what's wrong with north-facing.</p>
<p>So we cheered up and carefully wiped the window glass, not letting a speck of dust remain on it.</p>
<p>In this way we began to study; day and night, the desk faced the window,</p>
<p>What we read was engineering. Endless numbers, endless charts to browse. When drinking tea, the numbers floated up and down with the tea stalks; when we fell asleep, we shouted out numbers in a daze. Living in the most bustling city, we had actually become infected with a terrible loneliness.</p>
<p>However, this loneliness will not linger for long, because the window stands in front of our faces.</p>
<p>We looked far away through the window. We saw the first yellow leaf falling from the sky, followed by the dense autumn feeling of endless falling leaves. At dusk, crows with black feathers perched on the big tree in front of the window, chirping hard, as if begging people for thanks, because it was the only singing bird at that time. The electric light came on, the window was covered with light, a hazy and bright eye. With this bright eye, we would see a boy with bird's-nest hair running towards a girl with flowing hair and blue clothes, whispering some words of love at the foot of the wall, and then running away secretly and happily.</p>
<p>Winter came. The winter in the north is indeed much colder, if the winter in Jiangnan also has to be described as cold.</p>
<p>However, we dared not say it was cold, for fear of wronging the window. If the cold made us suffer, it was responsible; because it faced north.</p>
<p>The whole winter was spent in the wind and snow.</p>
<p>A thin layer of ice condensed on the window glass, like a veil on a young girl's face. We couldn't see the sky outside the window, and our lives were frozen again. Heavy loneliness, complicated numbers.</p>
<p>We waited anxiously, listening with our ears for the passing of winter. The monotonous night watch, the sharp whistle of the train, the cawing of the black-feathered crows, the cracking of the coal flowers in the stove, and the sound of snowflakes hitting the window.</p>
<p>The whole winter was spent in loneliness.</p>
<p>However, spring was bound to come after all. The girls on the road took off their veils, and the windows also took off their veils, as clear as after the first wiping.</p>
<p>We looked far away through the window again. The window faced spring, and our lives also turned to spring.</p>
<p>We will always be grateful for the window, even though it faces north.</p>
<p>(Tianjin, March 1947)</p>
<h3>Purple Swallow</h3>
<p>— Jin Shan</p>
<p>If I were a purple swallow, building my mud nest under your eaves: In the early morning, secretly peeking at the smiling dimples on your blushing face, Spring locked in your drowsy spring sleep, Then without you waving your slender hand, With a light flutter of my wings, I would fly into your dreams,</p>
<p>I truly envy a purple swallow, She chatters all day at your window. When lovesickness sinks into the silence of dusk, Listening to the night rain sprinkle on the window lattice; A lonely lamp accompanies spring sorrow, She just silently guards your window (Revised old work in March 1947)</p>
<h3>W鹤 Lou and Cuiping Mountain</h3>
<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>The story of the uncle killing his sister-in-law is described twice in Water Margin, once for Wu Song and once for Shi Xiu, and the latter's story is in Jixian, Hebei, and there are still relics that can be examined today. There is a W鹤 Lou on the main street of Jixian City, the corner of the dangerous building, hidden in the shade of green poplars, and the elders pass it down, which is the makeup building of Yang Xiong's stepwife Pan Qiaoyun in the old days.</p>
<p>Pan Mountain outside Jicheng was once a famous area in the Jifu area. Cuiping Mountain in the lower Pan is where Yang Xiong Shi Xiu killed Pan. The Ganhuasi Temple next to the mountain has a magnificent architecture, and the poems on the walls are almost full. There is a five-character ancient poem, chanting the story of Qiaoyun, which is very readable. It is recorded here. The poem says: "The sun sets on Cuiping Mountain, driving past its right side. People say the daughter of Pan, was once a wife of Yang. The prefect and the officials go to the government, and the empty room is sad and lonely. The sky of love has broken, and the Buddha's law is not pure. Ananda's precepts are destroyed, and Guanyin's bones are decayed. To this day, the dressing building is hidden by the drooping willows. A guest listens to the end, straightening his clothes and shaking his head repeatedly. At first it was said that there were nine hundred, and the gentleman did not speak. The leisurely Teng and the weeds compete, who can put it right or wrong? Call the boy and cook dinner for me, and light a bucket of wine for me. Yihe's world is far away, and this matter must not be." It is not easy to sing vulgar things in an elegant way. It is a pity that I don't know who wrote it!</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Hong Chengchou was ordered by Sizong to lead his army out of the pass and fought with the Manchurian soldiers in Songshan Xing Mountain. The army was defeated and surrendered to the enemy. His assistant general wished for the mountain and was called Zhipu, and made a picture of green pine and red apricot, implying past events. The superior was extremely elegant, and many famous scholars and dignitaries in the early Qing Dynasty were happy to interact with him. He wrote Pan Mountain Zhi, saying that the victory of the upper Pan is in the pine, the victory of the middle Pan is in the stone, and the victory of the lower Pan is in the water. It is not as good as the Cuiping Mountain written in Water Margin, with mounds and mounds, and another kind of desolate and lonely concept.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Talk on Solitary Mooring</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>"Is love conditional?" Two young friends were arguing heatedly. Finally, I was asked to criticize their words. I stopped them from expressing their reasons to each other - in fact, I had already summed up enough, and it was not just once.</p>
<p>"I can't answer your question with a so-called criticism. I can only express my opinion on the issue you are arguing about; because love is a strange word, and countless interpretations and debates have been made about it throughout history," I began my speech in this way, and then I said simply:</p>
<p>"Like the universe and life, love is an existence, and it is also difficult for us to understand its essence. We can only give a collective interpretation of what it has presented in history --</p>
<p>"Therefore, I think what we are debating is not what is the essence of love? (That is a question as difficult as the origin of the universe and life.) But the process of love; this, at least in my experience, has been considered a fairly simple question.</p>
<p>"Borrowing the words you often use when arguing with each other, I say that love is a journey from conditional, rational departure to unconditional, emotional realm."</p>
<p>The two young friends thanked me and left without objection.</p>
<p>After reading Fang Jun's great work "Love, Divorce, and Husband and Wife" from Free Talk, I completely disagreed with the opinions in this article. Fang Jun's meaning is that after men and women get married, they should give up all their heterosexual friends, at least not allow them to associate with heterosexual friends alone.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to frankly express my views.</p>
<p>Everyone (regardless of gender), I think if we use a circumference to perfectly illustrate it, the maximum area or maximum achievement that can be obtained in their body or soul field is only 180 degrees, and if they want to complete 360 degrees, then they have to rely on another life.</p>
<p>In fact, it is difficult for everyone to complete their own maximum area or maximum achievement. Therefore, they will never enjoy true perfection, but it does not affect their one-sided subjective happiness.</p>
<p>Great people, such as Tolstoy, Goethe - ... In my opinion, they are able to feel the sadness of the sunset especially because they have completed 180 degrees of their souls. If you accuse them of abusing love, then it is too unfair. Because they cannot obtain the other half of the circumference. Magnificent buildings are often home to vulgar markets, and beautiful bodies often hide crude souls. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Proposal of the 60 Central Committee Members - Requesting the Immediate Replacement of Chen Yi</h3>
<p>— Flying Dragon Flying Dragon</p>
<p>Sixty Central Committee members requesting the dismissal of Chen Yi - if this news is true, then the wise government can quell the anger of the Taiwanese people.</p>
<p>We are not clear about the current situation in Taiwan; however, one thing can be seen: Chen Yi's style does not fully conform to the intentions of the highest authorities; for example, the highest authorities said that the Taiwan riots should be handled peacefully, but the Taiwanese military and police were dispatched, with a post every three steps and a police officer every five steps, completely in a military state. Also, with the government's consent, the Taiwan慰劳团 (comfort group) went to Taiwan to comfort the people, but it is said that they were monitored by the military and police personnel of the Chief Executive's Office for one night, and were forced to fly away from Taiwan the next day.</p>
<p>This shows that Chen Yi thought subjectively that force could suppress the riots as much as possible, but in fact, this is wrong.</p>
<p>The riots of the people are sometimes temporarily motivated by righteous indignation, and perhaps there are excesses; but a part of it is probably still that the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taiwanese people have indeed had gaps and resentment for more than a year. If the government can understand the people's feelings and abandon the root causes of the problems, the situation will not be difficult to ease.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fact that the sixty Central Committee members of the Third Plenary Session asked the government to dismiss Chen Yi is an extremely wise move. As long as these people who have been in the hands of the enemy for five or sixty years can indeed change them and turn to the motherland again, this does indeed depend on the government's careful consideration of the current situation in Taiwan.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Men and Women in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shi Juanying</p>
<p>In the eyes of the people in the flying world, the relationship between men and women in Shanghai is relatively forward. However, the people of Shanghai themselves know that this step is neither forward nor backward, and is quite embarrassing. The combination of men and women in the countryside must go through marriage. The people of Shanghai regard living together as common. With the relationship of living together, they can go in and out together just like married couples.</p>
<p>However, the people of Shanghai still have to take this living together seriously. After living together, both parties are mutually responsible, which is cohabitation in legal terms. At this time, if one party suddenly does not want to cohabit, there is the possibility of being accused of abandonment. On the one hand, it is a casual arrangement, which seems quite free, and on the other hand, if you regret it after living together, you cannot get rid of it equally freely. It is really a painful thing for the people of Shanghai to live in this society and cannot escape this contradiction. Naturally, the woman and the child will suffer in the end.</p>
<p>Recently, a certain son of a wealthy man, Yu, was accused of abandonment by a woman surnamed Chen. According to Chen, this young master Yu is a person without a formal wife, all of whom are living together. But when Yu talked about the son of the woman surnamed Chen, he said, "I don't know if the child is mine." Regardless of whether what the two said is true or false, it is indeed visible that the relationship between men and women in Shanghai is one step ahead of the countryside. The embarrassment is that although the two are not formally married, they cannot break up casually. A woman raises a son, and she has to recognize his father for him, in order to not only determine his identity, but also to have a financial support for him. Our society acquiesces in the convenience of women's free association with people, but does not give them the second step of protection. The only thing they have is to cry and beg that man. This is a pathetic protection without independence.</p>
<p>The second pitiful thing is the "crystallization of love." His identity is shaky and uncertain. Although I was surprised that when the abandonment case was opened, a sympathetic reporter on the scene made a special note in his pen. It was said that the child looked very similar to Yu, so that the man could not deny it. Isn't it a pitiful thing that a child has to look like his "father" (and perhaps have a blood test in the end) to be considered his son? However, what is even more pitiful is the education that the child receives. Not to mention dropping out of school due to poverty. The court asked him: "If you don't go with him (Yu), what do you want?"</p>
<p>"I want money"!</p>
<p>Reading these three words, you can hear his voice, and everything that this child has gained from such a parental relationship is also said in these three words.</p>

<h3>A Nightly Chat - The So-Called "Silent Feeling"</h3>
<p>— Huang Liang</p>
<p>In the winter of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], Dharma Master Taixu resided at the Chang'an Temple in the accompanying capital of Chongqing. My friend, Mr. Qin Yiyun, having dreamt of his sister (who lived in an occupied area) suffering greatly from illness, received news after the victory that his sister had passed away long ago. The suffering she experienced at the end of her life was exactly as he had seen in his dream. Therefore, one night, he urged me to visit the Dharma Master together to inquire about the profound meaning of the soul in Buddhism. The Dharma Master said, "In Buddhism, there are six supernatural powers that can connect with spiritual feelings. Recently, some people can cause the 'other mind' to, in a hypnotic-like state, understand all the forms and sounds in the spiritual realm. This is the fifth supernatural power. Previously, Mr. Wu Tingfang was able to use a state of altered consciousness to evoke feelings, which was a preliminary achievement in spiritual studies. There are also people in India who can do this. As for hypnosis, the term is not very appropriate. It should be changed to 'Silent Feeling' to be more accurate. He advocated this theory ten years ago," he said.</p>
<p>When the Dharma Master spoke, he quoted scriptures and explained in great detail. Unfortunately, my knowledge was limited, and I could not fully understand. Now that the Dharma Master has passed away, his disciples may collect his posthumous writings and compile them into a special book. Therefore, I am recording the general outline of what I heard for future reference.</p>
<h3>News Highlights</h3>
<p>— Tie Yun</p>
<p>There are many rumors about so-and-so senior official coming to be the mayor of Shanghai. In fact, Shanghai needs a five- or ten-year construction plan. Whether so-and-so senior official comes or goes, this plan must be implemented unchanged.</p>
<p>The geishas accompanying bathers in Chengdu only earn 50,000 yuan per month. Living in this society is truly like being preyed upon by "kidney-faced, fanged" blood-sucking "demons," just hearing about it is enough to make one shudder.</p>
<p>The weather is suddenly cold and suddenly hot. Doctors say that smallpox, meningitis, and diphtheria are prevalent. Citizens must open their windows more often and eat more fruit. But it's a pity that there are many people living in pigeon coops, what can they do if they have no windows to open? As for fruit, it is a luxury that ordinary citizens dare not hope for. In these days of constant worry about running out of food and fuel, can they still often taste Florida honey pomelos and foreign lemons?</p>
<p>Heavens, let them die of illness! What does it matter about infectious diseases and "terminal illnesses"? White rice and green vegetables are what matter!</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial Assembly passed an important case, the content of which is: "Warning a certain newspaper reporter." If a reporter can be "warned," it shows the extent to which "reporters" have been "devalued" today.</p>
<p>A colonel officer being reduced to a street vendor seems to be a legitimate way for demobilized military officers to make a living, but unexpectedly, he was arrested and brought to court for it.</p>
<p>Although the "colonel" has been demoted to a "street vendor," he is innocent.</p>
<h3>United Nations General Assembly Newsreel - A Valuable Short Film</h3>
<p>— Chi</p>
<p>Currently, playing simultaneously with Cathay and "Mysterious Lady" is also the "United Nations General Assembly Newsreel" held in London. This is a short film of supreme historical value. (British Prime Minister Attlee delivered the opening speech, welcoming representatives from various countries. He then expressed the determination of the United Nations to strive for peace. Today, in order to preserve humanity and maintain world peace, all factors that could lead to war must be completely eradicated.) But Attlee's speech was not just empty words, but was expressed with concrete objects. For example, the horror of war, the screen showed the true image of war. As for the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, the screen showed the real scene of the bombing of Nagasaki at that time. Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of our country attending the United Nations General Assembly, also appeared frequently in this film. This is a more meaningful short film than "Is Hitler Alive?" We sincerely recommend it here.</p>
<h3>Prosperity and Unity - One of the Current Affairs Couplets</h3>
<p>— Ya Mu</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Fang wrote current affairs couplets for a certain daily newspaper. His ingenuity and skillful hand were universally praised and widely recited for a time. Now, I am imitating his style and trying to create a new couplet. To avoid the ridicule of continuing something inferior after a masterpiece, I am afraid it will be very difficult! - Written by the author at sea, March 19th.</p>
<p>Must revitalize domestic goods, only then can we become strong, beware of empty talk, turning illusions into empty promises;</p>
<p>Without achieving peace, how can there be unity? Who can sincerely handle affairs, true worth is as rare as a unicorn or phoenix feather!</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Miracle of the Human Body</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Once you understand most of the reasons for the human body and its health, "you will wonder why people get sick." A doctor said, "If my patients had sufficient rest, proper food, and peace of mind, more than 90% of diseases could heal without treatment." Because the human body, like a ship, can repair those minor damages to daily health, as well as the body after acute illnesses.</p>
<p>Human organs often have reserves when needed. When a person suffers from tuberculosis, although a part of it is destroyed, he still has more lung tissue than he needs. He uses the reserve power to maintain his life.</p>
<p>There was a doctor who had only a small portion of healthy lungs left, but he still worked for forty years. Facts tell us that a person can live normally after losing two-fifths of his liver. Often when we see doctors performing surgery, cutting off or tying off thirty or forty blood vessels, we will definitely wonder what will happen to these blood vessels after they stop circulating? But we still have more than we need. Each person has about twenty-two feet of intestines, but if we take away three or four feet, we will not have any problems.</p>
<p>When the heart valves become inflamed or deformed, the situation is like half of a door opening. As they gradually deform, the heart slowly thickens, and the muscles gradually strengthen. A heart that is normally the size of a fist can increase to two, three, or even four times that size. A person must do this, otherwise, he will not be able to live.</p>
<p>After a doctor removed one kidney from a patient, the other one began to grow to twice its size and do twice the work. All the tissues were rebuilt. You must know that the construction of the kidney is more complex and different than ordinary buildings. This amazing ability is what is called "the miracle of the human body."</p>
<p>Another natural defense is rest. If you twist your muscles, before the doctor comes, the natural force puts on a splint, because the twisted place becomes so painful and difficult to move, so that we dare not move it. When a person is extremely emotionally agitated, or extremely frightened, he naturally says, "Rest!" So the person loses consciousness, he "faints!"</p>
<p>Divine power has given us great healing abilities to keep us healthy. He has a never-tiring intelligence. Those doctors are imitating it. When we are fighting against diseases, we often have a great intelligence and power working on our side.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>June 29th of the Same Year</p>
<p>Some people in Hengyang are willing to fight hard battles, and the situation on the front line has surprisingly improved somewhat. The situation in Guilin has also unexpectedly eased.</p>
<p>On the main street, soldiers wearing khaki uniforms, carrying guns and shoulder poles with pots and stoves, passed by in an endless stream under the scorching sun. They had all traveled long distances from the rear. — Trains and cars were busy抢遝 transporting supplies, so of course they had no time to transport them. Generally, their spirits were very tired, and some had already suffered heatstroke, but they still had to hurry. The heavier things were carried on horseback. The horses were tired, but the things they carried were not light, and they had not been unloaded for rest for two or three days. The skin on the horses' backs was broken in many places due to prolonged friction. Several horses fell on the street and rolled around. Looking at the strips of bloody red flesh exposed on their backs, you could understand why they were in so much pain that they rolled around on the ground.</p>
<p>Cars, station wagons, and shiny chartered cars came and went non-stop, carrying big merchants, big bankers, and quartermasters in neat uniforms who never went to the front line. But they had no mind to pay attention to these groups of people and horses who were relying on their own legs to rush to the front line to fight desperately with the powerful enemy. Because the war situation had changed, business conditions naturally had to change. Some goods had fallen in price, while others had risen. Some bulky things that originally had to be abandoned in Guilin, now that there was enough time, everyone had to change their minds again. Therefore, they were really busy.</p>
<p>Little Shen hitched a ride on Xu Shaoming's seven trucks transporting electrical materials to Liuzhou and back. He returned today.</p>
<p>"Your wife might come tomorrow, so as an old friend, I'm giving you a heads-up—" he said to Fatty Xu in a teasing tone.</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming was at home inviting the assistant managers of the China Tea Company to dinner. Lan and Jin Aili had already finished dinner and were taking Fei Fei and Rong Er to enjoy the cool in the yard. Only the two of them were still toasting each other in the dining room.</p>
<p>Little Shen looked at Jin Aili as if he hadn't seen her. He had long forgotten this woman.</p>
<p>"Really?" Xu Shaoming received this ominous news and felt a chill down his spine.</p>
<p>Little Shen first waved a clean white handkerchief on a rattan chair a few times before sitting down.</p>
<p>"Who would lie to you!"</p>
<p>The assistant managers with blood-red noses also smiled knowingly at Lao Xu. (2) (1)</p>
