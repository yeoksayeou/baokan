<h3>魏使偕代表團飛平　採集華北東北資料　考察結果將呈告蔣主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕魏德邁新聞顧問華生，二十一日語記者，魏使團一行，除總幹事赫金斯中校及傳達員迫勃上士，速記員改斯通上士等二人留京整理談話紀錄，並與各方保持聯絡外，均將於八月一日午後自大校塲墓地乘專機飛平。渠對使團將赴綏考察之傳聞，表示無所悉，並謂比行時間僅及一週，已決定前往之城市爲大津，藩陽，靑島，此外若干重要及情況許可地區是否前往，將現時間而定。至旅大已決定不擬訪問。華氏本人對北平憧憬已久，對其首次故都之行，至表興奮。渠之和氣周到在此兩週間已於新聞界中造成良好印象。渠個人亦以得認識衆多中國記者同業爲大快事。</p>
<p>〔本報北三十一日電〕魏使一行十一人，己定明日下午來平，李宗仁及吳奇偉將同返。此間已爲魏擇定北京飯店及後圓恩寺主席行轅爲下榻地。惟美領館方面亦作準備下榻處，明將由魏任擇一處。聞魏除應李宗仁，何思源歡宴外，不擬多事酬酢。何已定二日在頤和園歡宴。魏氏決留平三日，四日晨飛津，逗留一日，五日離津飛潘，七日過靑島返京。張垣方面，聞亦作歡迎進備，惟去否未定。此間教育界擬上書魏使，內容尚守秘密。</p>
<p>〔路透社天津卅一日電〕魏使將於星期一將來天津逗留三十小時然後赴瀋陽在津時將下楊美領事署，津市長杜建時，美領事署，美商會及社團代表等，均將至權塲歡迎。記者詢此間美領事史密斯，已否準備向魏使提出關於天津情况之報告？史氏不答，僅日請向魏使詢間。</p>
<p>〔本報台北卅一日電〕比間當局現正積極準備歡迎魏德邁特使蒞台考察，其台北駐節所在，將選定爲草山糖業公司俱樂部。</p>
<p>魏使在京表示　始終欽佩主席</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕魏德邁卅一日晨對某造訪者談，渠此行之任務，爲絕對獨立性質。杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿，雖對渠加以任命，並曾指示工作要旨，但對其工作進行及所採態度，並未預爲限定。渠係以中國好友之立塲調查中國目前之事實，　受資料意見，　別眞偽，歸納分類，再作獨立判斷，得一正確之結論，以供美國政府之參考，俾有所決定，助中國解決各項難題。魏氏稱，自一九四四年渠繼史迪威將軍任蔣主席之參謀長時起，即對蔣主席深爲欽佩，時至今日，中國之局勢雖已因各種因素而形成不幸之分裂局面，渠仍相信蔣主席必可領遵中國人民，克服一切內部造成之困難，一如渠曾領導彼等度過外來之侵略憂患。渠以爲中國之最大問題，即若干中外重要人士，對若干事實無從得悉，例如一九四四年冬，敵騎入黔之危險局勢，蔣主席之若干下屬，未即據情實報，直至魏氏親自戰塲視察歸告後，方始詳知一切。渠此行非唯爲使中國現况見知於杜魯門，馬歇爾，亦將以一切實情陳知蔣主席。渠同意蔣氏不僅爲國民黨之首領，而應超乎一切，為所有黨派及全國人民之領袖。渠亦同意國民黨應開放政權，其他黨派亦應無條件其同担負政治責任。魏氏謂渠來京匝旬，兩度晤見蔣主席，尚未談及實際問題。渠決於北行歸來後，再與蔣主席長談云云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京卅卅卅一日電〕政府某高級官員告合眾社記者稱：「魏德進甚爲幹練，渠對中國局勢瞭如指掌，我人不必將關於共黨之一切對渠指出，渠已熟知之矣。魏德邁代表團能至戰事前日一行，當更能完全瞭解中共之受莫斯科支持也。希望「中國之友」勿勿勿漠視目前之威脅，重蹈日本侵略之疆轍也。」據悉，魏德邁已放棄與中共接觸之努力，蓋渠認此爲不可能者，然渠仍希望獲得中共自提提出之任何情報。</p>
<h3>中間黨聯盟代表　向魏氏提備忘錄　內容分政軍經三大部份</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅卅卅卅一日電〕美大使館公布，魏德邁卅卅卅一日晨曾與若千人士接談，主要賓客爲中間黨聯盟代表林東海，郭慰相，趙茂文，甘　等四常委。此外十十十一戰區總可令部之劉雪松少將及財部職務總局聽警處長曾錫珪少將，均作短暫之拜訪。魏氏全日大部時間除與其顧問會商檢討連日收冀之巨量資料文件外，並移其一部注意力，計劃其即將開始之華北，東北旅行。魏氏於工作時間進其午餐，晚與司使共餐。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕中問黨聯盟代表於卅一日上午十一時一刻至十二時半訪晤魏使長談，討論目前中國政治，經濟，教育諸問題。談話中述及蘇聯之民主經濟爲集體體制，美國爲自由競爭，中國之民生主義實頗適合國情，並談到中國中庸之道。最後論及中國教育問題。相談一時餘，尚未盡言，當約該黨等代表容渠赴北平返京後再談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕集合國民自由黨，民治黨，民生共進黨，中中中和黨組成之中問黨聯盟主席林東海及常委趙蔚文等四人於訪晤魏使後語記者，渠等曾向魏提供備忘錄一件，內容分政，經，軍三大部份：（一）政治方面，以爲國內及國際政治上之兩大壁壘對</p>
<h3>糧食會議昨閉幕　徴借實施辦法修正通過　蘇川兩省徴借數額確定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕卅六年度糧食會議，三十一日閉幕，閉幕式前舉行第三次大會，出席各省主席，義長，田糧處長等七十五人，王雲五主席，糧長俞飛鵬報告分省商討之結果，略謂：原定本年度需糧四千五百萬祖，經與各省商討後，合計黴借尚僅三千餘萬担，不足一千餘萬祖，決定價購部份將向外洋收購。旋由俞氏宣讀徵實徵借糧食實施辦法修正方案，就文字上討論，略作修正後，通過（原文見另條）·會後舉行閉幕式，仍由王雲五主持，致閉幕詞後，禮成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕糧部定二日召集各省田糧處長舉行糧食業務檢討座談會（即即即田賦會議），會期半日至一日。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕江蘇省征實，征借數額業經確定，原則爲征一借半，借額爲二千四百萬元，每元六升，計爲一百四十四萬擔，徽額倍之，公糧在外。　〔本報鎮江卅一日電〕蘇省田糧處爲加强征實工作，對各地辦理徵實不力之田糧處長，分別撤換，蘇州田糧處副處長改派朱少靑充任，宜興田糧處副處長改派楊德懷，靑浦田糧處副處長改派全行俎接充。　〔本報鎮江卅一日電〕關於外埠食糧（包括殻米小麥麵粉）由鎮轉口運出省境前往華南，華北者，頃聞省府准糧食部代電，必須仍先報經糧食部核准後，始可啟運，否則不能出境。</p>
<p>〔本報成都卅一日電〕川本年征實原己確定配額，嗣以中央爲動員戡亂，決再征借，並召開全國糧食會議，現決定川本年征實重新調整配額原則，（一）征借總額九百萬市石，（二）全面征實，不折征法幣，（三）本年到期豰款及公糧，由中央照價收購。省府現特分全川一五四市縣局爲三期，自九月一日起開征，並定八月中旬召開全川行政會議，商討征借動員等問題。</p>
<h3>在京各省主席　舉行省政會談</h3>
<p>〔中央肚南京卅日電〕行政院曾兩度邀集在京各省主席，舉行行政座談會，研究省政改革方案，茲定卅一日晚九時再行集議進行三次會商，繼續交換意見。立，終必引起第三次世界大戰，故主張中國僅應有一獨立之中央政府。此政府麽包括中間黨派，各方之自由份子。目前之過渡政肘，應予擴大改組。今秋之大選，亦應向各方開放，而不限於在朝三黨。東北問題必須解決，希望美國予以正視，並應協助中國收復東北，獲得八年抗戰之勝利成果。（二）經濟方面，八年抗戰之餘，繼以內亂，經濟幾瀕破產，財富集中少數官僚資本家，財政政策亦未依據經濟實况而確立，致預算不能平衡，通貨膨脹，故建議應以借款及改用金本位，改革並穩定幣制，應以有效方法立即制止物價上漲，藉維民生，應就人事及制度兩方着手整頓。經財金融機構，應使私人資本（尤以華僑資本）及外資得充分發展，鼓勵對外貿易，繁榮經濟。（三）軍事方面，渠等以爲任何政黨不得擁有獨立軍隊，否則必將因政治權利之爭執，發生內亂，並因思想壁壘之對立，引起國際戰爭，故中國軍事之改革，必以消滅政黨擁有獨立軍隊爲主旨。渠等於備忘錄之結論中，指出：（一）「權獨立，領土完整。美雅爾達密約曾決定中國以若干利益讓予蘇聯，俾維遠東和平，然今日局面，證明中國已蒙受重大損失，東北問題迄未解決，且將危及世界和平。美國曾參與雅爾達秘密會商，匯有責任協助中國收復東北。（二）勝利以來，因中共作亂，政府限制人民之若干自由，八年抗戰所獲得之進步，今竟退步。（三）中國政治之不良，在於眾多賢能之士被摒諸政務以外，今後如不對此反省，萬難奢談革新。（四）中國必須獲得大規模借款，否則六個月後必有可怕之經濟破產發生　〔法國新聞社倫敦卅日電〕關於魏德邁將軍奉命前往遠東調查一事，頃由倫敦泰晤士報加以評論稱：魏德邁將軍不僅赴中國調食，抑且亦將前往朝鮮調查，美蘇混合委員會在朝鮮業已遭遇若十困難，且未能組織朝鮮臨時政府，美蘇意見紛歧之點，乃在「臨時」二字，因此美蘇兩國官員未能成立諒解。目下朝鮮政黨衆多，以言共產黨蘇聯似仍努力將其傳統之學說行諸朝鮮，堅稱共產主義爲民主之最佳方式。是以魏德邁將軍奉社魯門總統之命前往中國調查，並將朝鮮亦列入其調查範圍內，殊堪慶幸。</p>
<h3>煤炭產會議　今晨在京開幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕煤炭增產會議，定一日晨九時開幕，截至卅一日止，報到者已有廿餘單位，代表五十餘人，收到提案及計劃四十餘件，該會會期三日。</p>
<h3>開放對日貿易事　中政會原則同意　商務考察團本月中赴日</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕中政會爲討論開放對日貿易問題召集之臨時會，卅一日上午九時舉行，戴傳賢主席，經四小時許之辯論後，再由少數委員整理文字，當決定在原則上同意開放對日貿易，惟其性質應屬於指導性之貿易，同時其體決定三項辦法：（一）關於組織派赴日本商務考察團之人選及其名額，應由政院決定，並定八月十五日前出發。（二）輸入·輪出物品之種類·數額，應視其需要，由我政府決定。（三）若干必需物品，應由政府指定爲賠償物品。會中發言之委員·凡考慮是否對日開放貿易者·均側重於我當前面臨之危機，恐不能經日貨傾銷之打擎，孫科亦會發言，認爲開放後，吾人仍應採取嚴格管制，俾防止日本東山再起，以遂其侵略行爲之野心。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張君勱論開放對日貿易，大意調：消極反對開放，並非上策。最主要者爲審查日貨之性質與用途，而決定是否准其進口。派遣駐日商務代表，可與審查商品同時進行，我國目前之情形，恐無大量之煤鐵供給日本，故不必以原料資敵爲慮。而審查商品辦法實行後，即可防止對貿易之入超。至於日貨之大量走私，因日本缺乏商船及商業機構，亦不必過慮。提高中信局之對日易貨數量，甚爲得計，同時可依商品之性質分類，宣國營者國營，宜民營者民營。</p>
<h3>立委簡貫三談　對日貿易關鍵</h3>
<p>我國匯一有機宜對策</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕立委簡買三，卅一日就對日貿易間題語記者，對日貿易即即即令現在開放，因和約尚未簽定，其輪入之稱類及數量，可受嚴格的限額制度之限制，其嚴重的後果，不在現在，而在將來。若現在不開放，但一二年內和約成立後，仍要開放，故對日貿易問題之關鍵，不僅日本將來工業設備保留在一九三〇到一九三西年水準以上，爲我國國防民生套上永久的威脅，我工商界對此未嚴辭抗議，僅只討較現在的貿易開放問題，殊覺有捨本末末之　。第二，中日最大海外市場，均在南洋，我應向遠東委會提出具體方案，限制日在南洋一帶活動，以防其經濟帝國主義死灰復　。第三要深自覺省，只靠原料品輸出國外，係落後經濟無出息的表演，必須致力於工業合理化運動，即機械現代化，出品標準化，售價便官化，始有開拓國外市塲之資格，第四，日本厲行飢餓出口堅苦之心，復興之志，足資我國朝野之警惕，而我大都市瑩富奢靡之風，社會泄沓之氣。相形之下，何以自立。第五，日本現有紡綻三百卅革枚盟總擬擴充日本紡綻到六百萬枚，日本自己又有蠶絲擴充四年計劃，均與我國紡織業及蠶絲業大有妨碍，我國對內對外都應有機宜對策，以免爲害將來。第六，日本貨品假道港澳潛行內運之利潤，比運銷英美貨物更爲優厚，此亦應運帶制止。</p>
<h3>第三季輸入分類數目　全經會調整限額　今後從給外匯為發展民族工業　征財產捐案交小組審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕全國經委會卅一日下午三時舉行第九次會議，張院長主席，重要議案有財部所提「財產捐征課方案」等案，據財部意見，建國特別捐名義易被誤解爲自由認捐性質，深恐因名稱之改變，影響將來實際征收之效率，致失創辦本稅之原旨，惟原來「一次財產稅」又與臨時課征之資本捐意義不同，故改稱爲財產捐，俾正正正正聽聞，而利利利征收，其內容以五億元爲起點，採累進方式，督導機關由立法院監察院及民意機關代表，社會賢達，財政專家組識之，各省市設分會，以省主席及市長爲主委，此案因内容繁多，交財政小組先行審查。會中所討論另一要案為輸入管理委會擬具第三季輸入分類限額分配數目，根請討論案，各委員對第三季輸入分配（八九十三個月），根據珍惜外匯，減少不必要之進口主張，大加調整，王雲五主張減少煤油數量，李敬　主張減少棉花數量，簡貫三主張減少烟葉·汽油數量，增加周　儀器·飛機零件及公共汽車數量·陳方主張減少羊毛數量，結果照以上意見分別增減，共減少七三七萬美元，並將減少之數額中提出五十萬美金作為購買國外圖畫儀器之外匯，今後外匯供給，爲發展民族工業，對於生產器材及零件，由海月一六〇萬美元增爲二百萬美元。</p>
<h3>孚中等公司事件　詳情日內可發表　主管當局現正收集資料</h3>
<p>〔中央社奉市訊〕自京滬各報列載孚中揚予等公司破壞進出口條例，向國行申請大量外匯，輪入禁止進召之貨品後，揚子，孚中兩公司當局，卅一日已刋登巨幅啟事，有關聲明。中央社記者爲明瞭國行　准外匯事宜詳情，特於卅一日往訪國行高級負責當局。據稱，我國結匯總額，因與國家外匯資源有關，奉論未能發表，惟關於孚中，揚子事件，中樞極爲重視，主管常局現已着手向有關方面盡量收美資料，預料日內即可有詳情發表。實際情形如何，當不難水落石出。在本行未奉到財部命令前，本人實無權對外透露任何消息。關於揚子孚中等公司輸入禁止進口貨品一點，記者卅一日又往訪輸入品管理處處長張福運氏，但張氏適因公外出。據該處負責人員稱，該處對於進口許可證之發給，均須按照規章及合法程序辦理，江海關亦需憑許可說允許客商經辦各貨進口，對行商許可證之核准，本處一秉至公，向無偏袒。關於汽車進口規則則則，概以一九四二年度原價在一千二百美元以內，座位以七人以下者為限，原價係依照廠家售與汽車商爲標準，且須照年齡折值。關於無綫電輪入之評可，其以官價結匯者，需在卅五年十一月十七日以前定貨，而在十一月三十日以前裝出者爲限，如用自由外匯，則祇以去年十二月三十日以前裝出者爲有效。</p>
<h3>孚中等三公司　結購外匯實數</h3>
<p>南京中央日報昨更正</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕南京中央日報卅一日登載孚中·揚子等公司結購外匯之實數，對廿九日該報之紀載，有所更正，特聲明兩點：（以下為中央日報原文）</p>
<p>（一）本報記者未見財政·經濟兩部調查報告之原件，故所記各節與原件當當當有出入之處。</p>
<p>（二）本報所記載各該公司結購外匯之數目，有數處漏列小數點，以致各報轉載時，亦將小數點漏列。查—</p>
<p>孚中公司結購外匯爲一五三七七八七·一一三美元。</p>
<p>揚子十公司結購外匯爲一八〇六九一〇·六九美元。</p>
<p>中國建設銀公司結購外滙為八七七·六二美元。</p>

<h3>民社黨全代會　一場激烈爭辯</h3>
<p>試行調解內爭未成</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社社社黨昨日又錯過解決內部糾紛之一次機會。緣於七月廿七日，經張嘉璈氏之斡旋，張君勱與伍憲子會晤於國際飯店，商討消除內部糾紛之方案。結果議定三點：（一）恢復除名人員之黨籍。（二）取消革新委員會。（三）革新派人士參加此次之全代大會。當時雙方均表同意，並於談話記錄上簽字爲憑，惟連日全代大會開會時，均未提及此事，而張君勱則希望伍憲子能出席全代大會，作正式之提議。昨日下午六時，伍氏應邀至民社黨總部，但在會塲上聲明並非出席，僅爲到會有所報告。當時代表李微塵即起立發言，謂伍憲予以副主席資格到會，至表歡迎，但希望伍氏正式簽名到會，再談調解之事，並詳述黨內糾紛之由來。李氏辭畢，他人繼起紛紛發言，其中不乏激烈言論。常時張君勱見勢不佳，即力勸以團結爲重，刺激之話可不必說。担此項勸告，收效甚微，會中空氣愈趨惡劣，秩序亦因而欠佳。至將散會時，伍憲子復建議將此事交大會主席團辦理，又經出席代表否決，致不歡而散。張君勸事後表示：「本人對廿七日議定之和解辦法贊成，但今日則爲大會否決，本人之地位頗似第一次歐戰後之威爾遜，本身贊成和會之決定，但和約則爲美國會所否決。出席大會之代表中，百分之七十爲新產生之代表，本人實無法左右其意見。至於將來是否再有和解之機會，現在不敢說，惟民肚黨與海外之關係，深信不致斷絕。伍憲之調停，全爲好意，但到會而言「不出席」，亦失之拘泥，致引起困難，實爲憾事」！</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民社黨全代大會昨日上下午均開會，討論該黨總章草案，至午後七時始經三讀通過。內客共分八章，再分四十四條，甚為詳密。今日全日審查提案。</p>

<h3>臨朐大捷嫓美四平　城內外共匪已全被肅淸　殲匪逾四萬正續追擊中</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島卅一日電〕臨朐大捷係卅日下午五時之事，靑島於深夜後獲得此訊。觀察家認此爲山東的四平街之役·影響山東戰局有決定性作用。當南北兩路援軍分由尼姑山，幕虎山及上上上下五井東西夾擊，裏應外合之際，匪猶圖掙扎，睛空一碧，空軍活躍，砲火亦能集中發揮火力，匪終不支，陳勢混亂，乃食皇退却，城內守軍艱苦，已至彈　援絕之境，全賴飛機接濟，適又連日險雨，賴李彌將軍鎮定指揮，將士用命，至卅日氣候轉晴，援軍趕到，士氣大振，乃以雷霆萬鈞之力，一鼓而造成臨朐之捷，獲致輝煌戰果。觀察家認爲共軍於七月七日起發動攻勢，攻泰安，犯費縣，南竄台兒莊，企轉變其內綫爲外綫，並分散國軍之兵力，而國軍竊破其險謀，自動放棄若干據點，集中兵力，相機捕提其主力而打聲之，遂相繼收復各據點。臨朐之戰，共匪原擬趁一間隙，集中兵力，攻擊扼駐臨朐濰城間之國軍精銳部隊，然國軍俱能以一當十，究成大捷，使其陰謀破滅。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南卅一日電〕臨朐國軍已獲決定性勝利，城內國軍李彌部與增援國軍於卅一日續向分三路敗潰之陳毅七個縱隊舉續追擊，迄發電時，共匪傷亡已逾四萬，生俘者千餘，又被國軍包圍於城北之殘匪一個師，除一部突圍北竄外，大部已被國軍殲滅。魯各界決日內慶一祝臨朐大捷，並擴大勞軍。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島卅一日電〕圍攻臨朐之匪總崩潰後，卅日晚分三路逃竄北退，一部常晚抵膠濟綫與張專員天佐所率保安隊激戰于堯溝以西，李彌師長親奪所部追擊向益都逃竄之匪，臨朐城內外巳無匪蹤。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州卅一日電〕犯臨朐之共匪華東野戰軍七個縱隊殘部，昨晚分路向膠濟路北狼狽逃竄·七日來共匪傷亡六萬餘，其八九兩縱隊，損失殆盡，流竄魯南山區之共匪一四兩縱隊及五縱隊之十三師，兩週來携械向國軍投誠者計有兩萬餘，其殘部七千餘，現被國軍在滕縣西北之休城繼續圍殲中，因彈報糧絕，投誠者日眾。魯西國軍卅日下午六時收復鄆城，羊山集地區仍激戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南卅一日電〕魯西南戰事又趨激烈，劉伯誠之五個縱隊，於增補後，其中兩縱隊於廿七日復回竄入羊山集，一縱隊又竄犯城武北約廿公里之大田集，一縱隊及獨立旅，卅日自大義集東竄郭里集，國軍各路強大兵團正繼續圍殲中。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州卅一日電〕由滕縣鄒縣問界河及官橋偷裁津浦路之匪兩縱隊，廿九日起已被國軍包圍于徵山湖畔之金家莊，其中第一縱隊己被國軍殲滅達二分之一以上。又自田山張武（汶上西南）向東北回竄之兩縱隊殘餘，卅一日起突向寗陽攻擾，刻寗陽城郊又已展開激戰，各路國軍正續兜捕中。</p>
<h3>東北匪又圖蠢動　發動謠言攻勢聲稱將再犯四平</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽卅卅卅一日電〕東北共匪第六次攻勢，有即即即將開始作試探攻擊情勢。北路懷德方面，共匪集有主力一部，擬攻公主嶺，南路藍平共匪準備犯大石橋·營口，又共匪近發動謠言攻勢。聲稱八月卞旬再攻四平，惟以共匪實力估計，實不可能。日前共開首腦在哈市開軍事檢討會議，海露四平戰役，共匪死傷逾十二萬人。又據四平軍方俘獲之文件中，證明匪軍死傷共九萬人，可確證共匪主力損失過半。惟匪在四平東西兩翼山地積極補充訓練，其次一行動，自堪重視。四平守將陳明仁將軍，昨以坦率堅定口吻語記者稱：渠甚歡迎共匪再　四平，四平軍民對四平安定深具信心。</p>
<h3>冀西掃蕩戰　暫告一段落</h3>
<p>〔本報保定卅一日電〕冀西國軍掃蕩戰暫告一段落，聶榮臻　部約四萬，刻由太行山區行唐，平山，靈壽，流竄安國，定縣，新樂，東長壽及平保路東側，並沿保滄公路東進，國軍刻已相繼撤出冀西曲陽，唐縣等地，轉移戰地，兜剿共匪主力。又平津保三角地帶國軍，展開掃蕩工作，自容城固安向外伸展攻勢。</p>
<h3>晉匪「算老賬」　造成農村恐怖</h3>
<p>〔本報太原三十日電〕共匪「算老賬鬥爭」愈演愈烈，到到到處召開所謂「訴苦大會」做法爲訴了就鬥，鬥了就分，誰訴誰分，再訴再鬥再分，造成農村恐怖。共匪在隰縣，大寗，永和等縣，迫民種鴉片，復强以偽幣六萬元一兩收買，武裝送入國軍區域，企圖實現毒化陰謀。</p>

<h3>聯合國會籍委會席上　徐淑希義正詞嚴　對蘇代表謬論痛加駁斥</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖三一十日電〕中國代表徐淑希，本日於安理會會霜委員會中發表演說，駁斥蘇聯代表二十八日指責中國應負北塔山事件之責任之聲明，而稱之爲「外蒙占之謊言」。徐氏之演說，實爲中國代表在聯合國中歷來措辭最爲强硬者，其中對蘇聯代表所謂北塔山地區在外蒙境內一節斷然駁覆，徐淑希本日先解釋稱：渠猶未見及蘇聯代表克拉辛爾尼訶夫二十八日所發表聲明之節錄，茲僅就大體上，加以答覆，徐氏反駁蘇聯代表指責中國係入俊外蒙，俾使全球注意其新張一節謂：「倘蘇聯代表謂外蒙古古古之入侵新疆，旨在援助華北方面叛徒，使對中國政府發生牽制作用，並作爲第二戰綫者，則其對遠東政局之見解當較前透澈多矣。」克拉辛爾尼訶夫本日覆中國代表時，其論調似較二十八日爲緩和。渠指出中國代表之要旨，爲北塔山并非在外蒙境內一端，然中國代表，固未能對外蒙外長之聲明（克氏所引援者）加以切實駁覆。克氏除表明蘇聯代表團，不認爲北塔山在中國境內一點，且質問謂：「如此說屬實，則中國爲何竟縱容其境內發生武裝部隊衝突之事」？徐淑希答稱：言及一國家能否「縱容」本牙受他人攻擊一端，誠屬荒謬，克拉辛爾尼訶夫本日不但重申北塔山事件係由中國某部份人士意欲　移全球對中國內部局勢之注意而造成者，同時質問此新疆事件爲何適於遣派所謂事實考察團來華之前發生？克氏此語，顯針對魏德邁考察團而發者。渠並謂：「報導所稱，曾有蘇聯紅星標幟之飛機一說，純屬無恥謊言。」徐淑希當指出該委員會於討論時至今爲止，僅蘇聯代表提起具有蘇聯標戰飛機參與作戰之事。該委員會之波蘭籥主席，於中蘇代表舌辯完畢之後，建議將外蒙加入聯合國之申請，延期討論，俾其他代表，得有時間研究中蘇兩國代表之聲明。延期討論之議，經美國代表表明此項擱置，須屬臨時性質後，遂獲通過。</p>
<h3>美副國務卿談　對日和會問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社華感頓卅日電〕美副國務鄉羅維特，今日向記者招待會稱：遠東委員會之美國與其他十國代表，將再度討論決定對日和約初步會議舉行之日期。該會議本擬在八月十九日舉行，但因與八月廿六日澳大利利利亞之康白拉舉行之帝國會議相衝突，而予以延遲。渠對紐約前鋒論壇今日刋載之華府消息，未曾提及。該消息稱：中國所對美國建議，即遠東委員會十一國家於締結對日和約時表決權利等，因此舉將使中國不能瑛得與其在戰爭中所受巨大犧牲相稱之發言權。紐約報紙之報導，或係根據最近南京參政會日前提出之建議。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中央社記者今晚自可靠方面獲悉：我國政府對於美國邀請出席十一國初步對日和約會議之覆文，已於七月廿四日送交國務院。按該院發言人在本週初及今日均謂未接到中國覆文，南京復文尚未宣佈。</p>

<h3>救濟物資停運華北後　聯總提出新計劃　霍寶樹克利蘭抵京晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕行總署長霍寶樹，聯總中國分署長克利扶蘭，於卅一日聯袂由滬來京，並於下午晋謁蔣主席，對目前善後救濟事宜，有所陳述。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總華盛頓總署於昨日宣佈：在共區救濟物資之分配未得更滿意之商定以前，華北區救濟物資之接濟，包括政府區及中共區在內，均暫時停運。此項命令自七月廿八日起生效，北緯三十四度以北之地區，包括華北及車北在內，所有預定接濟之物資，不論爲政府區或中共區者，均由聯總中國分署加以保管。聯總之採取此項行動，乃在我國政府正式聲明在戰區物資分配不能保護之後，聯總方面認爲此舉違反公平分配救濟物資之原則，遂提請聯總　東區域委員會加以注意，遠東區域委員會經調查後，遂向聯總中央委員會提出停運之建議。中央委員會經考慮後，一面立令暫時停運，同時向蔣主席提出一新計劃，將過去協定之八萬三千噸物資中未運完之五萬噸，運入中共控制區域。</p>
<p>新計畫內容</p>
<p>其新計畫之內容為：（一）在八，九，十三個月中劃出同定之三星期，將烟台視作戰時法令下之〔安全港」，俾聯繼之自由船隻得載運聯總救濟與善後物資進入烟台。此項建議之另一部份，爲共黨當局應提供保設，當聯總船隻椗泊烟台時，不得運用該港作任何軍事上之活動。此種活動，包括物資供應在內。（二）以二萬五千噸物資從天津沿運河運入共黨控制區，爲期二週，作一閃電式」之運輸工作，首次在九月間，後則在九，十兩月間，在此期內，從天津沿運河南至泊頭（河北省內，約在天津西南七十五哩之處）之區域，均應停戰。此外。黃河工程之設法繼續，亦在協商中。</p>
<p>以上之新計劃，如爲中國政府所同意，聯總中國分署將奉命取得中共方面之必要保證。聯總中央委員會已決定十五日之期限，取得政府及中共領袖對此新計劃之同意。屆時如此項計劃不能實行，則中央委員會將車新考慮聯總之中國救濟計劃。</p>
<h3>社論　聯總物資停運華北</h3>
<p>聯總總署昨日宣佈，自本月廿八日起，業已將救濟物資停止運往華北共匪控制區及政府管轄區。聯總中國分署並說明理由稱：因中國政府最近聲期不能再保護救濟物資在戰區分配，故使聯總停止以救濟物資運往共匪控制區，有背救濟物資平均分配之原則，乃請聯總遠東區域委員會注意此事，該會經考慮後，即向聯總總署提出停運華北之辦法。聯總中央執行委員會乃訓令中國分署照辦，並提出兩項辦法，要求中國政府接受。我們對於聯總的決定，頗多感觸，茲述一二，以供中中外人士的參考：</p>
<p>第一，聯總產生於大戰苦難時期。當時大家都預料到戰援各國人民經濟生活的艱難，爲未雨綢繆計，在戰爭還沒有結束時，就在美國成立這個國際救濟機構。迨戰爭勝利之後，聯總即開始在歐洲亞洲各處，從事救濟工作，迄今已逾一年有半。歐亞各國尤其是戰災各國，的確也受惠不淺。但是在急待救濟的中國，聯總工作的成績，似乎遠不及他國。我們推原其故·殆有下列列列兩項原因：一個是聯總工作人員對於中國的政情認識不淸，常常爲了救濟共匪控制區的問題，與中國政府不能和諧合作：另一個是聯總工作人員本身的問題。中國老百姓在報紙上雖然常常看到救濟物資源源運來中國的消息，但是在實際上，究竟受到多麼大的恩恩恩惠？</p>
<p>第二，聯總對於運來中國的救濟物資，主張不分政府管轄區或是共匪控制區，應該公平分配。我們在原則上，當然也可贊成；因爲共匪控制區內的老百姓，同樣是我們可憐無辜的同胞，應該受聯總的救濟。但是，問題不是應該或不應該，而在聯總將物資運到共匪控制區以後，在那裏的老百姓能否眞正分配得到？是不是落到共匪手中成爲齊盜以糧？這一個問題，一定不是聯總工作人員所能了解的。我們不妨告訴他們共匪控制區內的實際情形，不要說是聯總的物資，不會分配給老百姓，就是老百姓自己所有衣食住行的必需品，也不能保留爲自己生活而使用。所以聯總將救濟物資運往共匪控制區，在表面上說是救濟那裏的老百姓，在實際上，無異於接濟共匪，培養他們作亂禍國的實力而已。自政府明令戡亂動員全國人力物力剿共建國之後，由聯總接濟共匪的事情，當不能容許其繼續存在！</p>
<p>第三，聯總以「停運」爲手段，要挾中國政府接受其所提出的辦法，這種作風，更非爲我們所能容忍。我們於此，又不得不反問我們的政府，聯總究竟已經有多少物資運到中國？假如沒有聯總的救濟，中國人民是否要完全死亡？中國歷史上大亂援的人民沒有外國的救濟，是否就滅了種？中華民族是至大至剛的民族，與其向人搖尾乞憐，以求「嗟來之食」，還不如咬緊牙關，忍饑耐寒，而謀自力更生之道。所以我們要健議政府，斷然拒絕聯總的建議，絕無加以考慮的餘地。如果聯總一意孤行，那末我們寗願教聯總在中國的工作提早結束。</p>
<p>第四，聯總的性質，與普通慈善機關不同，它負有安定戰後世界各國社會經濟的任務；對於戰災各國內在的實際的情形，應該特別重視。聯總工作人員。在負資分配救濟物資時，尤應具有遠大的眼光，萬萬不能根據個人的偏見，否則被救濟的國家，不僅不能受其利益，反而有使該國的社會經濟更陷於紊亂狀態之虞。</p>

<h3>蘇北運堤潰決　沐邳等縣報災　陸地行舟秋收絕望</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江卅一日電〕連日在風暴雨，沂沭運諸水猛漲，中運河堤已潰決多處，水勢洶湧，沭陽，邳縣，宿遷，東海等縣已一片汪洋，陸地行舟，秋收絕望。蘇省府迭據江北運河工程局及各該縣電報災情，至爲重視，除一面常飭各縣合力搶救外，惟以需款需料急如星火，特再急電行政院及水利部。迅將本省防汎經費即日核定撥發應應用，以免災害擴大。</p>

<h3>福州對外交通　陷入隔絕狀態</h3>
<p>海空公路均不暢通</p>

<h3>印澳提請仲裁印荷爭端　安理會開始討論　英美仍擬試作會外調停</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三十一日廣播。安全理事會今日下午三時開始討討論印澳兩國　請阻止荷印戰事之提案。按安理會原係討論巴爾幹問題，但現已決定對荷印問題，予以優先考慮。據消息靈通方面稱：荷蘭正竭力企圖阻止聯合國干預荷印方面之戰事。因此，安理會乃先發調人，優先討論荷印問題，而暫時中止辯論巴爾幹問題。聞安理會討論荷印問題，為期甚短，如不獲解決，將予以擱置，重行處理巴爾幹問題。此次安理會採取迅雷不及掩耳之行動，優先討論荷印問題，已使荷蘭阻止聯合國干預荷印戰事之企圖關於失敗云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京卅一日電〕官方人士今日聲稱，澳洲向聯合國機構提出印尼事件，中國政府將予擁護。中國所最關切者爲迅速制止印尼戰事，以免危及華僑生命與財產。關於訓令聯合國安理會中國代表支持澳洲行動一節，外交部尚未正式決定，但凡可制止印尼戰事之任何切實步驟，中國政府無不準備爲之後盾。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕美副國務卿洛維特三十日在此間首次公開證實，美政府在過去十日內曾與英國及其他國家討論印尼事件。此間官員認為安理會殆已一致認為必須迅速採取和平解決之步驟，但各國主張頗有不同。印度主張聯合國立即指斥荷蘭之錯誤，澳洲則根據「印尼事件足以危害世界和平」而主張聯合國加以干涉。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕就貝文外相在下院答議員問之言觀，英政府似仍贊成以調處之方式，而非向聯合國機構申訴之方法，以結束印尼之爭端，貝文並透露英政府仍繼續與美國交換意見中，因此已有人揣測英美或將採取共同行動，設法使荷政府終止印尼衝突者。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅日電〕英國外相貝文在下議院宣稱：英政府業已禁止荷蘭經由新加坡及英國在遠東之其他屬地以戰爭物資運往荷屬東印。至於英國訓練並配備荷蘭軍隊，則係英國在德國佔領荷蘭時向荷蘭所提供之神聖諾言，余僅可向荷蘭政府聲明，吾人訓練並配備荷軍，目的並非使其在印度尼西亞作戰。</p>
<h3>印尼籌組流亡政府</h3>

<h3>荷駐美大使揚言　聯合國無權干涉　辯稱印尼並非自主國家</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕荷蘭新任駐美大使克里芬斯頃否認聯合國安理會有干涉印荷事件之權，幷謂荷政府幷無要求其他國家調解此一爭端之意。克氏繼否認荷向印尼實行「殖民地戰爭」，及或將要求英國出面調解之說。並謂，近二年來荷出席安理會代表已一再辯明聯合國憲章祗適用於自主國家之間，印尼幷非自主國家，事實上亦無政府可言。至此，某訪員打斷其言，詢其荷蘭政府旣不承認其爲共和國，則爲何費時數月，與之進行談判，且曾與之簽訂協定，視之爲荷蘭帝國聯邦之一？克氏對此拒不作直接答覆，僅謂：荷蘭惟曾希望其爲合作代表云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社阿姆斯達丹卅日電〕印度與澳洲將印尼戰事提向聯合國申訴事，荷內閣已加討論，官方並未發表評論、非官方稱此事甚爲「可悲」。</p>

<h3>英政府堅決主張　德煤礦收歸國有　迄未接受美折衷辦法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕關於魯爾煤礦收歸國有一事，英美二國代表下週開始研究其增產問題時殆有發生衝突之可能，蓋英外相貝文不但欲使德國之煤礦且亦欲使德國其他主要工業，實行社會化，而美國務卿馬歇爾數月來試探國會人士意見之結果，探明此一計劃決難邀得國會撥出用款，由美國多數國會議員多認爲此係形成共產主義之措施。美國對收　國有建議及英國所提「立即行動」之計劃，已掛出一折　辦法，主張展期五年、待後由德國人民自行加以解決。但英國迄　接受美國此一折衷建議，堅持英國佔　區將立即實行收歸國有。故下週英美二國在此間召開德國煤斤生產會議時，此事將成爲激辯之問題云。</p>

<h3>蘇反對愛葡等國　加入聯合國</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖卅日電〕聯合國機構之委員會，今日討論愛爾蘭葡萄牙及外約但之聲請入會時，蘇聯曾從事阻止准許其加入聯合國。蘇代表克拉西尼柯夫所持之理由，乃爲愛爾蘭於戰事最危急期間，曾公然表示同情軸心國及弗朗哥西班牙。葡萄牙不但未曾援助盟國，且實際上援助盟國之敵國。以言外約但，則蘇聯對於外約但之獨立，尚表示極大懷疑云。</p>
<h3>英經濟局勢嚴重　社會主義嘗試面臨考騐</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦卅日電〕工黨執政二年，英國仍陷於窮境，街頭路角張貼標語警吿國人：「不做工就東餒」。十年不景氣，六年戰爭，益以兩年社會主義實騐，英國缺乏電力，缺乏搖床，刀叉，杯盤，曳引車，汽車，織物，鋼鐵等等，項目之多指不勝數，幾乎涉及生活之每一方面。但基本工業收歸國有之五年計劃，依照政綱規定，嚴格推行絲毫不苟。</p>
<p>第一年國會通過國營煤礦，航空公司，英格蘭銀行及有綫無綫常報等法案。第二年又通過其他法案，將鐵道，公共汽車，卡車等運輪事業與電力生產全部收歸國有。此外，並授機中央與地方官員管理地產，保證農作物價格與市塲滿意，强迫農民出力種植，否則將剝奪其土地。</p>
<p>惟人民仍衣衫襤褸，住宅苦寒，配給菲薄，紛紛怨訴政府措施嚴峻。麵包依然實行配給，僅鹹肉，鮮肉與牛油每週分派限量稍見增加。衣服配給制度雖略鬆弛，但職票所增無幾，且均耗於購買被單。主婦同盟對此頗表憤慨，政府則謂根據統計，糧食分配情形較諸戰前為優。前途危機隱伏，料將接踵而至。煤斤乃英國一大富源，但今冬又有匱乏之虞，局勢縱或不如去冬嚴重。政府已發出警吿，謂今冬電力不敷可能再度引起恐慌。</p>
<p>據商務部長克利浦斯宣佈，出口銳减，損失約達二億英鎊，合美金八億元。前向美國借款三十七億五千萬美元，不到一年己用去半數，大部份耗於糧食。如果全部用罄，除非繼續借貸，否則必致挨餓。鋼鐵產量漸見上昇，但僅堪供給全國復興與輪出需要百分之八十。關於鋼鐵收歸國有，下屆議會今秋開會時將予討論。</p>
<p>去冬大雪與水災消滅全國牛羊約百分之二十五，毀壞麥田數千畝，以致菜蔬等農作物收穫較預定遲一個月。政府允給農民更多利益，俾提高今年更季之糧食生產，並開始取消若干種糧食之貼補辦法，　資挹注，因而促成物價飛漲。下屆普選原定一九五〇年舉行，現以危機急迫，又有提早辦理之說。</p>
<p>保守黨擬定工業方案，重視私人企業，但亦承認社會主義化着干成就，例如煤礦國營之類。財政部對於金融問題甚感棘手。專家設法减少英鎊負債、迄未奏效。莫斯科方面之貿易談判，英國希望以機器易取蘇聯小麥與木材，業已破裂。工黨左翼不滿現狀，曾兩次「叛黨」。艾德禮總理今日應工黨議員之請出席秘密會議，報告應付經濟危機方針，聞已取得諒云。</p>
<h3>羅雅爾抵德</h3>
<p>〔中央社柏林卅日電〕美陸長羅雅爾今日抵此，與美軍政府總督克萊及其他委員會商。官方謂羅氏之來因鑒於德國佔領任務之重要而興軍政府官員進行商洽者。</p>
<h3>蘇致英照會　主延期批准和約</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕外交部發言人稱：蘇聯政府業已致牒英政府，表示希望在前敵國自行批准其和約以前，延期批准對義羅匈保芬和約之批准，同時則聲明蘇聯在原則上，並不反對五前敵國和約之批准。權威方面預料蘇聯此一態度，難望爲英政府所接受，其所持理由對於業已自行批准和約之敵國，若芬蘭根本不能成立，蘇聯此舉，不但將延遲和約之生效，且使討論義前殖民地問題之會議亦不能舉行，蘇聯前已聲明在對義和約生效前，不願討論義殖民地問題。</p>

<h3>蘇聯予南國援助　實現工業化計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒卅日電〕今日此間報載：關於廿五日蘇聯與南斯拉夫簽訂商務協定後之聲明稱，蘇南兩國自於一九四六年六月十日商定經濟合作之方針後，發展日臻密切，遂決定訂此交換貨物之協定，規定蘇聯在一九四八年內將以工業設備運至南斯拉夫，以助其建造各種工廠。迨一九五〇年起，南斯拉夫始將開始對蘇聯履分其義務，以盤產物運至蘇聯，或以貨幣償付蘇聯之機器。各報繼加以評曰，蘇聯今對南斯拉夫予以此一有效援助，其目的乃在使南國實現其工業化計劃及其經濟發展。</p>
<h3>不滿蘇代表濫用否決權　美將報復行動　希將就巴爾幹問題提出新控訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山卅一日廣播：美國對巴爾幹局勢之建議，業由蘇聯予以否決。爲針對蘇聯行使否決權起見，英美決採取報復手段。在英美鼓勵下，希臘已決定引用聯合國憲韋第七節，向安理會再度控訴其隣國之侵略行動。希臘之新控訴，可使巴爾幹問題不受蘇聯否決之影響，而留於安理會議程上也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅一日電〕此間消息靈通人士今日今稱，蘇聯在聯合國安全理事會中對於美國所提設立巴爾幹邊境監察團一案運用否決權後，美國或將採取斷然行動，以謀報復。美國代表瓄森昨奉國務卿馬歇爾召回華府協助草擬對策，今晨返抵此間，殆已携有具體方案，將於今日下午或夜間會議中宣布美國次一步驟。國務院與瓊森決定之對策內容雖尚未悉，但不出下列三途：</p>
<p>（一）根據聯合國憲章懲罰措施條款，譴責南斯拉夫，保加利亞與阿爾巴尼亞三國直接威脅世界和平，要求安理會加以討論。（二）根據聯合國緊急條款促請中，英，美，法，蘇五大國討論所能付諸實現之措施。（三）將全部巴爾幹事件提交聯合國大會，俾可設立邊境監察團而無運用否決權之處，但若未獲巴爾幹谷國同意，此種監察團依然不能在各該國境內執行任務。官方承認上述三途之一對於聯合國機構均將產生嚴車後果，但就另一方面言，蘇聯運用否決權後，局勢早極嚴重，無異向聯合國機構維護世界和平之權力公然挑　云。</p>

<h3>錯綜複雜糾纏半年的　北洋平部歸屬問題</h3>
<p>— 本報駐平記者　宋紹柏</p>
<p>錯綜複雜的北洋平部歸屬問題，現在已由教部令北大接辦，這糾纏半年的問題，於今似吿一段落，而北洋平部的教職員工，與不足半數的學生，以及平大工院校友會，還在堅決反對，所以八月一日北大能否順利接收，、還要看反對方面的發展。爲了此事的複雜，教部朱部長特派了教次田培林於週前來平，以快刀斬亂麻的手法，作了決定。胡適，及北洋代校長金問洙等，還在傷着腦筋。</p>
<p>北洋平部的前身，本是北平大學的工學院，畢業校友，頗不乏在今日社會中有聲有勢的人。敵僞時期，平工改成了偽北大的工學院，勝利後經過臨大的過渡時期，各校相繼復員，而她的歸屬，就成了問題。平工校友會，力爭恢復獨立平工院不成，北大淸華合辦不成、北大接辦初亦不成。結果，教育部把她劃歸了天津的北洋，而成爲其平部。這時已孕育了後來的多角糾紛。（北洋當局因爲鞭長莫及，已無法再辦下去）。這裏包括了教育部，北洋最高當局，北洋平部全體教職員，以自治會及護校會爲主體的，二派學生，平大工院校友會，及北大七方面。分析起來，共分出三種不同意見：（一）維持原狀，（二）獨立，（三）由北大接辦。</p>
<p>教育部對北洋平部的措施，是被批評爲缺乏整個計劃而惹起許多糾紛的。所謂教部是否對她最初就存了成見，局外人不得而知，但在屢次的改絃更張上，確是表現了舉棋不定。決定改北洋平部之後，二月裏即明令準備遷津，到五月，學生爲反對而罷課了，整個學校遂入於無政府狀態。到最近，又宜佈了由北大接辦。</p>
<p>平工校友會，雖屢次發宣言，上呈文，但沒有引起教部的重視。北洋平部的八百餘學生，經過全體反對遷津的過程後，就分出了二種不同的派別。其一是以學生自治會爲中心的一派，約佔其半數，反對遷津罷課有效後，主要的又作了要求北大接辦的工作。這時候就有人說：「北洋平部正如一位名花無主，而擁有富厚妝奩的少女，以北大爲對象，頻送其狄波」。這派學生沒有其他不良作用，只是仰慕了北大的聲譽。</p>
<p>另一派學生，是隨着全體教職員的意向，組成護校會，而主張維持原狀的。中間雖有過不少行動，但最後失敗了。七月廿八日教授會發表了這一派的三點反對意見，他們認爲第一，金代校長向教部接治歸北大接辦，沒有顧到平部各方的意見。第二，田教次培林來平後，行踪秘密，避免接見平部任何人，甚至陳藎民二次以電話相詢，均答未來，僅與北大磋商，態度欠光明，欠公允。第三，胡適亦不考慮多方意見，使二個學制不同的工院，勉强撮合。平工校友會，同時也表示了態度，他們認爲教育部不直接令北洋交出平部，而令北大接辦，是受了某方的壓迫。這一派在言諭上，似乎過激了，竟指胡適等是學閥，故其所指「某方」，是可以想象其意義的。他們還要發表「吿世界學生書」，具體的表示一下。並且有待魏德邁來平時，暴露「學閥」內幕的傳說，使人哭笑不得。</p>
<p>北大究竟如何呢？拒之科？受之乎？</p>
<p>在表面上看，胡適過去曾再三表示，關係方面雖希望北大接辦，但他從未考慮過。那理由也就是表現於事情決定之後，胡在七月二十五日致北洋校長金問洙，平部主任陳盡民的信中的話。那信是爲了表明其沒有對北洋北部轉什麼念頭而發表他說：「弟於卅日（六月）致電朱部長稱此事最好仍由北洋當局解決，增其經費，使其可以負責改革發展，北大工院人力單薄，不欲增加困難，……本日北大接到教部命令，尙祈約期會談……」</p>
<p>實際上如何呢？有人形容北大道：「以這樣一位富妝奩送秋波的少女，旣願投之於懷抱，又加有父母之命（教部）媒妁之言（北洋金校長），則北大當局雖不至如司馬相如的琴心相挑，亦不能若柳下惠的坐懷不亂了。」但爲什麼胡適對記者再三聲明未加考慮呢？實在是胡氏最初已看見了那羣依靠她（北洋平部）吃飯的教職員們早在注視着北大是否要奪他們的飯碗子了。</p>
<p>現在教育部令北大接辦的明令雖到，但因金問洙，陳義民先已去京，缺少負責人，而北洋平部護校會的學生又響應教職員的態度，表示了拒絕接收，所以北大能否順利着手，還是未可逆斜的。（七月廿八日寄自北平）</p>

<h3>四聯理事會決定　國棉押匯到岸必須贖取　不得轉做押款　接受糧部委托製粉廠商不另貸助</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕四聯總處卅一日晨舉行第三四九次理事會議，由理事陳果夫代理主席。到會理事兪鴻鈞·張嘉璈·徐堪·翁文　·霍　樹·陳啓天·俞</p>
<p>大維（譚伯羽代）趙棣華（湯鉅代）李叔明·暨徐秘書長柏圖·吳局長任滄·谷</p>
<p>局長春帆·壽總經理勉成等，計核定放款議案一百餘件，幷討論要案二項：</p>
<p>（一）關於各地麵粉廠貸款案，該處向係按照各　生產能力，核實貸放，爲最近糧</p>
<p>食部曾委託上海阜豐福新等五大麵粉廠辦理購麥製粉業務，該處爲明瞭此案經過</p>
<p>情形，特約請糧食部派員出席說明，以作今後核辦各地粉廠借款案之參考。當經</p>
<p>本日會議決定，凡已接受糧部委托製粉各廠，毋庸另由行局貸助，至其他各廠今</p>
<p>後亦應以定貨方式分別貸助。再定貨辦法，未核定以前，可按慣例核貸。</p>
<p>（二）該處去年九月所訂棉花押匯原則，已於本年五月底期，後經第三四五次理事會決定</p>
<p>，不再續展。自六月一日起，改按民生日用必需品押匯辦法辦理。本日會議，復予補充規定，今後各行局承做棉花押匯，應以自產區運往銷區國棉爲限。又押匯到岸，必須讀取，絕對不得轉做押款。</p>
<h3>中信局收購外棉</h3>
<p>申請踴躍已達三萬餘包</p>
<p>中信局收購之外棉，截至本日爲止，巳申請者達三萬餘包，計申新等廠十餘家，以申新數量爲最多，約佔十分之四，該局即將派員赴海關倉庫點騐收貨，仍交由各廠代紡。其代紡辦法，正與六區公會交換意見，公會方面，代紡原則已表示接受，詳細辦法尙待議定。</p>
<p>又訊到埠外棉收購申請日期。原定七月底截止，嗣經中信局第一次小組會議討論後，決定至八月十五日截止。據記者獲悉，此次棉花進口商方面，多數爲外商洋行，華商則佔少數。其向國外訂購結匯情形，約分三類：（一）外匯已全部付淸者，（二）已付一部份外匯者，（三）完全未付外匯，而由信用担保者。上述三種進口棉商中，現向中信局申請收購者，以第三種爲最多，至第一第二兩種進口商，因收購價格及官價結匯虧耗太大，且其間尙有交易上之轉輾售賣糾紛，未能解決，故多延擱。關於進口商對此次到埠外棉，代客買賣部份糾紛如下，（一）其向國外訂購時已付外匯部份，由各戶先行付給者，（二）訂購時之價格與現時之價格盈餘部份，而進口商自己經營部份已訂購而未到先行拋售期貨者，現貨到而朱能交貨之賠償問題等，亦均未能解決。</p>
<h3>棉紗布無起色　喊價依然下挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開以需求平庸，兼布價下游喊價依然下挫，尤以四二支細紗下降最鉅，藍鳳紗比上日續跌六十萬元，爲一千六百七十萬元，廿支特雙馬步降廿萬，爲一千一百七十萬元。輕雙爲一千零五十萬，軋低十五萬。十六支光明亦挫十五萬，爲九百卅萬元。其餘粗細各紗，一致步降十萬至四五十萬不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，以廣州市面倒掛，辦胃呆滯，漢口及長江一帶客銷亦形呆頓，兼以市上銀根微緊，貨主頻加了結。最後十二磅龍頭細布便小至四十二萬五千元，比上日軋跌七八千元，五福藍鷄彩球等細布，亦均下挫四五六千元，其餘士林布等廠盤，亦有局部减低，故價不振。紡建公司供售布疋，掛價與市價相彷，申購者不甚踴躍。</p>
<p>現棉仍軟</p>
<p>昨現棉趨勢仍疲，市况供多求少，人心虛軟，交易零星。更以棉紗步挫，紗廠與客帮納胃微細，市價一致看小。各檔做開極少，計靈寳送廠價二一一〇萬，棧交價二一〇萬，火機一七〇萬，南太倉一八〇萬，周浦籽花三三萬。</p>
<p>印棉到滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕福來公司經理羅馬利巴特溫號，前日到埠，由印度孟買運來棉花一萬八千件，另有檀香二十件。上項棉花除中紡一小部份外，其餘大部均係商家採購。據該公司稱，此項棉花分堆二棧，五千四百件堆建源碼頭，一萬二千六百件堆儲平和碼頭棧。又招商局蔡鍔輪，昨由營口返滬，運來生鐵一千六百噸</p>
<h3>美金債券暢銷</h3>
<p>昨日爲七月底，美金債券銷售數字，以受客戶紛紛軋進，當月利率關係致當日異常暢銷。公債部份，計銷去十四萬五千美元，內以紗廠界經售者爲最大多數，庫劵部份共銷去一百廿四萬六千七百七十美元，合法幣一百四十九億六千一百廿四萬元。</p>
<h3>統債略好　外股平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨中途堅定，惟漲後有回，統丙晨開九七〇〇元，潮帮及五〇三室俱進，升至一〇五〇〇元高價，後經三六〇室五五五室了結，微降至一〇〇〇〇元關邊結束。雜牌均自高小回，結果較前收計甲乙戊各漲二百元，統丙漲四百元，統丁亦好三百元，成交約四百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨熱股怡紗英聯有證券帮大戶童某吸收，初低後高，軋漲較勁，紙業賡續同瀉，廣帮洋行帮有供，錢兌業亦進。怡紗晨開八二五〇〇元，自八一五〇〇漲到八四五〇〇元結束，結果較前收計紙業跌半成，會德豐鋼業微挫，業廣航業平平，怡紗怡啤微升，英聯漲起半成弱。</p>
<h3>臨收浮空爭補　華股先疲後堅</h3>
<p>華股昨上塲時十分不利，掉期影響，報載雖有定貨貸款之伴訊，但中日通商之緩行，已遭政院否決，及財部巳令銀錢業不准當日支票抵用等，助賣消息又盛，過程始終疲多於堅。迄臨收時，浮空爭補，且票據不能當日抵用，尙待公會折衝，散空不能支持，軋空見股，而起反動，小型股新光景福在再度增資之鼓勵下，反均以最高價結束。</p>
<p>晨開見疲，遞永紗開低至二九元，一五三號再賣到二一七元，二二號三六號二二四號一一二號二號一八六號紛購，回升至二三九元。二三一號一一七號逢高了結而稍盤，六〇號八號一五七號二〇七號四五號一六〇號均進，銀行帮有納胃而扳高至一一三五元。十時十五分後，二二四號一七三號二三二號三五號一四三號二一八號一一七號二一九號一一二號紛售，聞廣帮在塲內外力售甚多，息價開高至一角八及二角二分半，曾再盤低至二二三元左右，一〇四號一八〇號一五五號來進，問升至二二九元。</p>
<p>十一時三十五分後，一〇五號二一九號一〇六號一一〇號供售，復迫低至二三二元，此後聞銀行界對當日支票之不能抵用，尙在開會商議補救辦法，一二號八三號二三四號二四號七六號紛補，午收現永紗升至二二七元，遞永紗升至二三二元收市</p>
<p>收後喊價平和，小型股新光景福在二〇四號之維持下，買風漸盛，各以高價結束。結果較前收計即交股新光獨漲半成，永紗華豐景福微升，信和美亞中法新華微降，勤興永公各跌半成弱，大通中紡國貨內衣中絲景綸均平，統益榮豐商務水泥微升，火柴麗安微挫。遞交計新光景福各漲半成强，永紗美亞信和華豐各漲少許迄半成弱不等，永公微挫，塲外各老設尙稱平和。</p>
<h3>團體分紅儲蓄存款　京滬兩地先行舉辦</h3>
<p>〔聯合徵信所訊〕團體分紅儲蓄存款，中信局奉財部令後，已由中央儲蓄會，着手準備實施事項。前有八月十一日開始辦理，九月一日舉行分紅抽籤之說。頃悉：該局以印刷等種種籌備，趕辦不及，已訂於八月十五左右開辦，第一次分配分紅，大致爲九月廿五日，至此次舉辦團體分紅儲蓄之目的，全在鼓勵儲蓄，吸收游資，以其作用而言，則有：（一）此項儲蓄，可作長期資金，（二）引導中產民衆與銀行發生關係，（三）代政府吸收游資，（四）投資生產事業。根據以上論斷，可知其意義之重大。計劃之初，係國家行局聯合辦理，政院雖加變動，但仍將先委託國家行局代辦，將來並可能委託商業行莊代理，以資普遍。並聞目下暫在京滬雨地先行舉辦，逐步推及全國、</p>
<h3>進口貨物驗關放行　以廿四小時爲限</h3>
<p>江海　發表消息稱：查進口貨物騐開放行時，例由本關在原遞提單上批註後，發交商人持往騐關房聲請驗貨或放行，並在提單背面加流年月日時戳記，騐貨組目單或放行細目單，同時由總務課逕送指定之騐關房，以憑騐放。在通常情形之下，此項細目單，應於廿四小時內送達指定之騐關房，商人於收到提單後，應察看背面所蓋日時戳記，如於廿四小時以後，細目單尙未送到指定騐關房時，應即向總務課或騐佔課騐貨稽察員報吿，以便追查。</p>
<p>又訊：進出口商人及報關行等，前來本關接洽事務者，皆應向各課關員或各騐關房騐貨員直接辦理，不得逕與本關聽差苦力關警，及其他一切雜役人等接洽任何事件。緣聽差苦力等向不准與商人直接授受報單提單，或參與報關，騐貨，蓋印，放行等事，如有故意違犯者，立予斥革。</p>
<p>現遞轉期交易，昨永紗自四元半起升至七元，而以六元半結束。多方貼出者較多，銀行帮二二〇號二〇七號四五號三一號一六五號等貼進。信和自八五元開後，自六五元量價升至一〇〇元收市，美亞自八元至一四元，華豐在二元左右，新光在四元五元之間，合息　　七分至一角二左右。</p>
<h3>市塲交易不旺　食米止漲轉跌</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千六百餘石，店方賣銷平淡，市塲交易不濃，市况止漲轉跌，重入疲境。粳秈米均見回挫萬元，惟白元貨稀俏利，價升萬元。陰元亦加一二萬元，浦東新粳前日共到十一石，昨日續到七石五斗，米質尙佳，極合粥米銷路。</p>
<p>麵粉廠方雖然堅挺，奈本街消化不爽，依然平疲少神，微挫千元。麩皮初堅後懈、平平之格，豆餅鄉消閒散，回低一二千元，黃豆隨各物下降，轉跌三五千至萬元不一。菉豆去胃冷懈，中次續跌萬元，赤豆忽上忽落，回高五六千元。蠶豆汕頭揀高有動，浙方選次拾取，本街略進，步砌三五千元，形勢活絡。苞米北洋收吸，回高萬元，紅糧乏貨，生仁洋莊停辦，頓形呆滯，挫跌萬餘元。</p>
<p>油市隨之不振，生油豆油菜汕均見下跌一二萬元，蘇油平正。</p>
<p>暹米運滬</p>
<p>國際糧食緊急處理委員會，前爲東南亞地方採購糧食分配事宜，曾在華府召開會議，決定我國於八月份中得在緬甸購一〇·五三二噸，暹羅七六八〇噸，九月份之預定數量爲緬甸一六。五〇三噸，暹羅六四〇二噸。上項分配額，業經新加　該　分會電達我糧食部知照。此間中央信託局昨午已接獲糧部訓令，着手佈置船隻，準備分批裝運來華云。</p>
<p>油價下跌</p>
<p>七月底前久摯之米價又吿蠢動，每担均上漲三四萬元不等，食汕價格亦跟蹤上昇。生菜油每担曾一度達七十三萬高峯，昨晨米價回鬆，每担平均下降一萬元左右，油價亦隨之下跌。生菜油已回至七十萬元，此外，則以中信局前向江浙皖菜籽產區，聯合榨汕業派員收購原料，目前運滬之貨已達五萬担，榨成菜油已有三千五百担。中植油廠爲抑平漲風，昨特以該廠存底菜油一千担，向市塲拋售，結果客戶胃弱，價格轉降云。</p>
<h3>陳祁門茶堅秀</h3>
<p>內銷茶昨本街及客帮之去化，依然絡繹，且尤以抵檔陳祁門，無錫一帶需要益多，趨勢愈活。售價方面，在貨方趁機扳抬中，急遽翱翔，其他花色，亦跟蹤帶堅。至於洋莊茶市，買風仍吿銷匿，而賣戶亦懷趦趄，全日過程，進出兩稀，交易完全陷於停頓，市氣則尙平定。</p>
<h3>審議陳茶價格決定三項步驟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理政府收購物資審價委員會，爲審議三十五年度陳茶價格，特於昨午召開會議，到中央銀行，中央信託局，中國農民銀行，審計部，四聯總處等代表多人，討論經過，決議三點：（一）推定中農行，中國茶業聯營公司，商品檢騐局，先會同評定各級陳茶價格。（二）評價收購前，如各茶尙須資金週轉，可光向中信局申請發給陳茶一部份之價款。（三）　請收購期限，早於上月廿五日截止。茲因尚有若干茶商逾期尙未申請，經由茶商公會申述逾期理由，特准予通融補行申請。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕三區繅絲工業同業公會，於昨日下午四時，假市商會大禮堂召開第二屆會員大會，由禇輔成主席，經議決三點；（一）自本年七月份起增加會員月費，每一絲車單位收月費二萬五千元，本年度基金按各廠繅絲量每担收五萬元，代繅者每祖二萬五千元。（二）該會下半年度每月支出預算表，送請各監事審查，（三）修正會間第六章經費第三十三條下第一二兩項，最後討論通過重要臨時提案七起，並決議電呈蔣主席，全國商聯會，全風工業協會，請求禁止開放對日貿易，</p>
<h3>複製業九公會開會　討論增加配紗數額　決先調查各廠實際需要情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市複製業所屬九同業公會，爲商討如何增加同業配紗數額，及對日貿易開放問題，特於昨日下午七時，假大西洋菜社，舉行聯席會議。出席染織·手帕·針織·內衣·毛巾被毯等業代表廿餘人，由染織業公會理事長潘士浩主席。</p>
<p>潘氏即席報吿，迭次與紡調會及紡建公司兩當局，洽商增加本市複製業配紗經過情形。茲分誌如次；（一）本市複製業需紗量，照今春估計，月需五萬二千件，而目前實際配量，僅及本業需要量五分之一。（二）紡調會目前紡調政策，頗爲積極，對本業代織部份，勢在必行。（三）當前紡管紡調政策之施行，實脫胎於民國卅二年時，大後方之花紗布統購統銷政策。惟本業對此項指出目前情形不同之點：（甲）現時紡錠不足，織機有餘。（乙）大後方時在爭取物資，及輸出物資，目前不同。（丙）推銷不易，配布爲難。</p>
<p>潘氏旋即動議提案三起，交會議席上討論：（一）對同業之生產設備，重行調查。（二）對日本貿易之開放，日本將以棉織品之外銷南洋爲重點，複製業應表示意見。（三）對同業製品，應爲計劃之預備，以配合代織及外銷。旋即由九業公會，分別報吿各業最近領配棉紗情形。最後決議：（一）請九業公會，迅即調查所屬會員家數，生產情形，需紗數量，除紡建配紗外，尙須仰給於黑市之數額，儘二日內作成方案，以便彙總向當局請求增加配紗額。（二）爲加強九業公會之聯擊計，決暫設複製業所屬九公會聯合通訊處，於本市染織業公會內。</p>
<h3>古耕談　歐美猪鬃市況　重慶鬃已受威脅</h3>
<p>猪鬃業權威四川畜產公司總經理古耕處，本年四月赴歐美攷察，並接洽業務之進行。本月初始行返國，古氏已於日前由渝來滬，聯合徵信所記者，爲明瞭歐美市塲情菜，及我豬鬃業之前途，特於昨日往訪。據談：我猪鬃之最大市塲，首推美國，次爲歐洲之英國。美云年進口爲七百萬磅，合五萬餘箱，本年以過去數月我之出口數量而言，恐不若去年之多，此中原因，一爲美有存鬃豆萬磅，需要减少，二爲尼隆關係，其質硬而齊，與重慶鬃不相上下，大半取重慶鬃而代之。惟重慶鬃猶爲工業鬃刷不可或缺之物，仍有需要。如美將來大量增加尼隆之生產，確爲重慶鬃之致命打擊，故重慶鬃國外市價，有看低趨勢。目前爲二元二角一磅，戰前爲一元五角，已不及戰前之一倍，天津鬃需要量大，爲油漆工業鬃刷之原料，大五五號可高至七元七角八一磅，小五五號亦可售四元五角。上海鬃亦有銷路，現價爲一元九角五。漢口鬃係作搭配之用，如以天津上海鬃作汕漆鬃刷，必搭以漢口鬃，現價三元三角五。以上係美市堪情形。歐洲方面，英國最多可銷二千箱，每磅十三先令六便士，他如法國·瑞士·比利時等國，均有銷路，但數量不多，總計不過數百箱。現德國工業已計劃復興，所需猪鬃數量極大，且多用短鬃，爲重慶鬃之最好銷塲，正與佔領國洽商中。如獲實現，係重慶鬃之一大轉機云。</p>
<h3>執貨者不願脫手　人造絲市氣重振　廠經略疲綢貨高而復低</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市又吿重振，開盤甚平，後傳聞中信局配售價有提高一倍之說，以致人心復榮，堅特不肯脫手。一二〇號高山有光開盤二千四百五十萬元，旋即上升，四百九十萬元有成交，最火到五百三十萬元。下午買戶存觀望，乃稍回低，最後價爲二千五百萬元，比上日高漲五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市略疲，高勻度五担頭喊價約短五十萬元，惟乏成交，中級另担成交價比上日軋小二三十萬元不等，做開價二千七百萬元，高另担二千八百萬元，均有十天期頭。二十八·三十條紋，七五分勻度E字等級，昨有五担成交，七天期頭價做二千八百二十萬元，廿八分干經有單子貨做開一千七百三十萬元，另担七百萬元，次者一千六百萬元，貨款均有十天期頭。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市眞絲被面，因賣多於買，以致高而復低，大誠貨開市即小，四十萬元有成交，中途到過四十五萬至五十萬元，後又降至四十萬元即期價收市。華强貨先做一千〇三十七萬元，後最大一計至四十五萬元，卒吿回小做三一十七萬元即期，四十萬元隔日期一。大誠格子　縐先做一二千八百元，最後三萬四千元有成交，比上日短八百元。華錦縐因人絲價高，昨市亦稍做大，高檔貨二萬二千五百元有成。</p>
<p>金山枝略鬆</p>
<p>金山枝前閉出百數件，元枝爲一百廿八九萬元至一百三十萬元，扁枝一百七十萬元至一百六十五萬元，其他爲百數萬元至九十萬元，市象平定，比前略鬆。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部前紡織事業管理委員會，於昨日下午三時許，假市府召開最後一次會議，由主委吳國楨主席，到委員及六區公會常務理事多人，討論至五時許散會。</p>
<p>昨日會議席上，對前紡管會時期收購棉紗出售後積存資金九百七十八億元之處理案，曾詳加討論。緣在行政院前宋院長任內，紡管會爲保管該項資金計，曾呈請經部准予組設提倡植棉發展紡織事業基金保管運用委員會，惟迄未接獲批示。茲者該項資金總額中，已爲經部調撥一〇三億元，內包括現紡調會之開辦費，前紡管會之解散費，及經部若干投資項目。昨日討論經過，若干紗廠同業，認爲該項資金之調撥使用，手續似嫌欠妥，與當初積存該項資金之原旨，亦有未合。爰決議再呈請行政院，速予組設該項基金保管運用委會，委員九人，包括民營廠三人，國營廠二人，政府方面四人，以便共商資金妥善述用之方云。</p>

<h3>共黨牽綫日軍參謀　桂粵匪幫跳梁　洗劫民槍民糧</h3>
<p>〔本報梧州訊〕記者此次着一片半似憂恨半似驚懼的心情，徜徉在南中國勾　山脈到十萬大山的綠，彷彿覺得自己正在踏上一個化　的毒瘡表層。　張發奎將軍說得好：「余至今仍認爲廣東廣西普無中共正式部隊」，這些南路的禍根，堅起大旗叫做「南路人民武裝解放軍」，仔細翻一翻來看，其實都是一批賊－一批受中共牽綫跳梁的匪　，所謂「中共華南局廣東武裝工作委會」，便是他們的主子。</p>
<p>南路匪帮，蔓延在粵桂邊界的，據官方最初公佈，不過是三五千人光景，在廣西的只有千餘人。嗣因靑黃不接，災荒重重，　民相率走險，遂至造成一發難於收拾的局面，就記者調查所得，嘯聚於陸川縣南迤至廉江以北一帶，以鄒優寗，梁扳威等爲首的股匪，即號稱三千之衆。至於分佈於化縣，吳川，廉江，遂溪各縣鄕間者，數目約在五至六千之間，雷州湛東方面以符春茂爲首者，亦有四千餘人，大抵都有一個「民主聯軍」的雅號，名目之繁多，實在運「聯軍」的「總部」也弄不淸。</p>
<p>南路匪徒五項「工作」</p>
<p>南路匪徒的作風，本來無足深慮，但是一個匪字上面加上一個奸字而成共爲「奸匪」的時候，傷腦筋可就不比等閒。據記者自有關方面找到一篇奸匪首腦洋洋洒洒的訓令，內開工作有五大項目；（一）盡量縱火燒毀一切可能燒毀之物資，（二）殺人掠村，以期造成恐怖局面。（三）派員濟八湛江，爆炸軍用倉庫。（四）積極破壞南路一切交通。（五）盡量刦奪車輛。這算是最近的「工作綱領」，因之滿城風雨之頃，自鬱林東下陸川，即可領略無數劍拔弩張的滋味，據老百姓說，淸明過後，匪徒即化零爲整，到處活動，陸川以南良田車田等地鄉村間，鄕村公所時遭圍攻，廉江麗之舖仔圢，帆嶺一帶，幾成匪徒天下，燒殺擄掠，無惡不作，穿公務員服的，穿軍服的。一拿到手，不問三七二十一，隨手就是一刀一槍，鄕村基層人員死於匪徒手下者，不知凡幾。遂溪縣四鄉間，十九爲匪徒所佔據，自東和至馬嶺安舖的股匪，組織頗見嚴密，指揮機構中，有中共組織之顧問團，且聞有日人多名掛起高級參謀名義，從中指揮作戰「總部」之下有參謀，情報，政治，聯絡等處，分司職掌，此等「民主軍」，最會虛張聲勢，以無作有，往往三五百人，東竄西奪，疑陣四佈。正當兵力集結，準備掃蕩之際，四鄕奸匪一散無踪，待到官軍勢力稍薄，又復爲他們嘯聚圍攻，弄到地方一無　日</p>
<p>廉江廣州灣間　匪帮勒收「保護費」</p>
<p>自云歲廣東遂溪縣長爲奸匪襲殺，以迄於今，匪勢猖獗之狀，有增無已，奸匪到處，居然皇皇文告，委派縣長，（如遂溪縣即派出局文熙，陳開濂爲正副偽縣長），肆意攻擊政府，極盡叛逆之能事。一方面開關設卡，勒收行水，自廉江至廣州　船隻，每一條船每月征收「保護費」六萬元－現增至九萬元。自赤坎（廣州灣屬）至安鋪公路的廉江遂溪交界地，「民主聯軍」的高脚牌皇皇高張，公然征收過往行商稅，收稅標準爲貨價百分之二十，貨値高低，由匪徒自行估定，往往估到全盤貨價也比不上稅率，行商此際只好自認倒霉，把貨物就地一放，拍拍屁股一走了事。好運氣通過的，走了邪門，還得要走正門，一過門也是一批「保護費」，護來護去，到得目的地，早已魂斷藍橋，欲哭無淚，遂令負販千里者，莫不視爲畏途，然而爲了生活，又不得不冒險犯難，有時候拉到關係，也可以講講「數口」！粵語，「打開」之謂－打好交道，即使貨如輪轉，亦便秋毫無犯。</p>
<p>蠻豬飢荒軍　居然放槍寫借單</p>
<p>自玉林至廣州灣對開的客車貨車，往往十次有六次以上走不過「老友，借點使用」的關煞，一聲「停車」，伏莽英雄瞄準車胎，「砰」的一槍，車子全盤洩氣，於是「蠻豬飢荒軍」－（按；老百姓喜歡把這一批「民主解放軍」誤作」　豬飢荒軍」，意義深長）一擁而上，連女人的內衣都脫光之後，然後揚長而去。有的還客氣地寫還一張借單；「茲借到××××號車乘客款項約計若干元，准於革命成功後歸還不誤，此據，南路民主解放軍第×士隊條」，眞是荒天下之大唐。</p>
<p>玉湛公路上的脾坊橋附近及雷州至湛江的石角塔附近，上月就會經演過這一幕戲，所可惜者，歐爲記者未能恭逢其盛而已。</p>
<p>大「賊」到處，要槍要糧，已成鐵則，廉陸等地鄕村，所有民槍民糧，幾已「鬥爭」殆盡，如廉江三合鄉，數經匪從洗刧，「一槍不剩，顆粒無存」，老百姓捱不得苦，死者何可勝數！奸匪暴行所至，脅迫村民獻出全部武器糧食，稍有不遂，即施以殘酷毒刑，竟有用彈棉花的牛筋緊緊勒住受罪者的頭部，兩面一絞，牛筋嵌入頭肉，鮮血淋淍，七竅流血，如此慘狀，聞者亦爲股慄，如遂溪縣某村村民楊大光，即曾備受此種皓刑。其他「坐飛機」，「點天燈」等等「善政」，由匪徒加諸於小地主，商人，公教人員身上的「淸算」，尙不計在內。（梁小中，七，廿八）」</p>

<h3>苦行軍在蘇北　努力捉「老鼠」</h3>
<p>華氏表的水銀柱上升到九十八度，赤日如焚，揮汗如瀋，蘇北的國車，配合着地方武力，却正在酷暑中進行偉大的戡亂任務——綏靖區淸剿戰。</p>
<p>淸剿戰的戰事，是在漫長荒野的濱海區展開。自三餘鎭至掘港，豐利，拼茶……以至東台一二三倉河一帶鄉區，士兵們負荷着全部裝備，從這一鎭到那一鄕，從這一村到那一莊，向前搜索追進。天氣酷熟，行眾艱苦異常，人和馬都熱得喘氣，汗珠是大把的望下抹。休息下來，小河成了大衆的恩物，跳在河裏呼啦呼啦洗一個冷水澡，週身感到無比的爽快。有時天氣變了，落下一陣大雨，每惆人通身上下淋得濕透。雨後道路濘泥，一顚一巓的趕往駐營地，夜間還要應付蚊蚋的侵擾，還要愼防着可能的偸襲。</p>
<p>「剿匪如捉老鼠」，你要捉它，它是到處倒躱深藏。你不注意它，馬上又出來偸竊和破壞東西。蘇北綏靖國軍，這一次以捉老鼠的決心和手段，到處追索淸剿，翻穴傾巢，想全部將這些在蘇北作祟的耗子們一舉肅淸。匪共是照例拿出它的看家本領，到處飛奔狂逃，並且使用殘酷的毒計，把那些地方「民兵」，留在後面作爲掩護，讓他們做自己的擋箭將。國軍在此次淸剿戰中，與殘匪遭過激戰，所有斬獲，除已見報紙電訊外，其餘就都是　到那些「肉老鼠」１</p>
<p>在這一次的淸剿中，國軍每到一地，鄉鎭保田長立即隨同入境，整理保甲，安撫民衆，搜查散匪。這對於匪共的打擊很不小，因爲鄉鎭保甲長，都是當地人，回鄕後，一切認輕就熟，尤其指認所黨一項，他們洞若觀火。軍方搜獲大批嫌疑犯，馬上送給他們指認，誰是附匪份子，誰是參加「鬥爭」作亂最厲害，誰是沒有參加匪軍工作，經他一一指認，絲毫不致有誤，其中附能份子，按其情節輕重，解送後方懲處，無附匪嫌疑，立即釋放，絕不拘押留難，務使匪區民衆，不感苦擾與恐懼。同時匪類要想利用隱身法，混跡其間，也就絕不可能。許多受着匪共長期蹂躪的民衆，到現在才得到眞正的「解放」。</p>
<p>蘇北是匪共的糧倉，濱海區更是它們造亂的大本營，因爲這裏是一片漠野，又不在公路當面，正可供它們作一個適當的「老鼠洞」。由這裏把蘇北的公糧集中偸運到魯南去接濟山東的匪軍，再由那裏把彈藥及匪軍運送到　裏來。今春魯匪一部回竄蘇北，有許多就是取道濱海區的海上交通。這次國軍向海濱疾馳猛攻，殘匪無法迴旋，即紛紛登舟往海上　命，被政府空軍軍轟擊掃射，撲滅甚多。國軍這次淸剿，除在沿海區發動外，通揚路南的沿江地區，亦開始配合行動，準備把沿江沿海殘匪壓迫移向內地，然後大舉撲滅。今夏割麥時，殘匪在四鄉大肆騷動，鬧得雞犬不寗，秋收前，緩靖當局來這一套敏捷的行動，予殘匪以致命打擊，今年的秋收，農民一定可保相當安定。</p>

<h3>荔枝滿天飛</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>八年前的炎夏，華者在南國奔走，當夕陽下山之際，最愛往茘枝灣一帶，徘徊於水畫艇之間，釋却日間工作的辛勞，也曾深嘗過那種核小肉厚漿多味甜的南國珍果——茘枝。</p>
<p>有時往岸邊走走，只見朱門泥牆之上，荔實櫐纍，高懸在二丈以上。所謂千顆萬顆，絳珠均勻，越牆撩八，不覺津流的情况，至今念念不能忘懷！</p>
<p>「本草」上說：南中八郡，出茘枝最有名；又說：茘枝殻朱膜白，甘美多汁。唐人徐寅作茘枝詩，頗爲膾炙人口，想來他也是個茘枝喫客，不妨錄出兩首供大家欣賞，這或許也算是，浮李沉瓜以外的消夏的一種妙法吧。詩如下：</p>
<p>「日日薰風捲瘴烟，南國珍果荔枝先；靈鴉啄破瓊津滴，寳器盛來蚌腹圓；錦里只聞消醉渴，蕊宮惟合贈神仙；何人刺出猩猩血，深染羅紋遍殼鮮？」「朱彈星丸燦日光，綠瓊枝散小香囊；龍綃　綻紅紋粟，魚目珠涵白膜漿；</p>
<p>梅熟已過南嶺雨，橘酸空待洞庭霜；</p>
<p>變山踏曉和烟摘，拜捧金盤獻越王。」</p>
<p>黃風瘴烟之中，茘枝首先滋長成熟，有「殼綻紅紋，珠涵白瞙」的色彩和美味，摘落下來，便是南國的珍果，甚至取來「拜捧金盤獻越王」，可見茘枝這稱水果在唐代是早已被珍視到如何程度了。</p>
<p>歷史上，愛喫茘枝的女人，當以唐代的楊貴妃爲最特出。明皇爲了　足她的茘枝癮，不惜耗費偌大的心力，由茘枝產區設法快運，其時交通困難，工具缺乏，唐明皇所能運用的特別快運，也不外乎傳驛而已。因此，御令旣下，一鞭當先，紅塵紛起，直送長安。古人詩云：「一騎紅塵妃子笑，無人知是荔枝來」，可說是這位嗜茘妃子（楊貴妃）的寫照。</p>
<p>這一幅歷史上的畫面又出現在今天的現實世界裏面了。所不同者驛馬變成飛機了。據中央社廿八日電稱：新鮮茘枝已上市，今年產量頗豐，售價亦廉，每斤售三千至四千元。商人們異想天開，正在接洽包用飛機，專運茘枝赴京滬銷售。自然，這是一個好消息：專機運水果的消息，至少不會比運動物（如「態貓等）不受我們注意。水果阪子可多做一筆好生意，自不待言，而上海的楊貴妃之流，從此不必冒暑遠赴南國，即可在電扇冰箱冷氣中間大啖南國鮮茘了，彷彿茘枝灣已經搬入他們府上一樣，這還不够稱爲口福非淺嗎？</p>
<p>茘枝專機滿天飛之後，我相信銷路必然更加發達了，但產地價格是否尙保持原狀，而不致高漲，這一點却似乎不無問題。我們試看看前項電訊，便知道廣植茘枝佳種的榕城古殺西禪寺，情形已經大不同了，依舊日慣例：每一位遊客，只要繳納一些香火費，便可隨你喫多少的，但現在已打破了這舊例，却需要計量取値了，這意思就是說，不能隨你喫痛快，喫多少茘枝，便得付多少代價了。可知當地的茘枝喫客是如何的悵然了。這種口福，大概是非落到楊貴妃之類的外省喫客那裏去不可了。</p>
<h3>「同志」的稱呼</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>「同志」，多麼親熱而響亮的稱呼，可是如今聽來着實刺耳。</p>
<p>當民國十五六年北伐時，「同志」的稱呼隨着國民革侖軍足跡，響遍了大江南北，全國的每個角落。不論上自主席·總司令，下至工役·勤務兵，都可相互地如此稱呼，當時每聽到別人在喊「東方同志」時，內心確是立刻曾湧上一陣愉快，深深地感到親切一，友愛和光榮。誰知「好景不長」，「同志」的稱呼不久就走上了沒落之途，直至最近數年，「同志」的價値更是每况愈下，竟發展到只限於上司對下屬，主人對雇員，尊貴者對微賤者的專有稱呼，這裘面決沒有再存在着一絲一毫的友意與親切，只是作了身份貴賤高低的指示碑而已。不信，請你去衝着你的上司呌一聲「某同志」試試看，看他臉上給你什麼顏色，假如你沒有什麼背景或裙帶關係的話，說不定因此就會碰着「另候任用」的命運。不過，也許你的上司比較開明，不以爲意，但是你的好同事們，會在旁邊嗤之以鼻，駡你這小子太不識體統的。</p>
<p>曾經有數次我跟了我們的主任，秘書和處長之流去參加過顯貴者所舉行的聚會，當主持者一一向別的顧貴們介紹：「這位是某主任，這位是某秘書，這位是某處長，這位是茶先生……：」時，別的顯貴們都欣欣然一一鞠躬握手爲禮；可是一輪到主持者在略爲遲疑之下指着我說：「這是東方同志」的時候，顯貴者們的臉上便馬上斂去笑容，勉强又勉强地露了露牙齒。此後他們談笑風生，歡洽異常；我却一直被冷落在一旁。推究其原因，皆爲我是「同志」的緣故。「同志」就注定是位卑職小之輩，不能厠身於顯貴之列的。我們聰敏的主持者之如此最聰敏的稱呼，却決不是當眞引我爲志同道合的同志，那祗是爲了保持他自己的身份與尊嚴，暗示了我的身份給那些顯貴者們所知曉而已。</p>
<p>想一想皆會令人氣煞：一年以來，我和一個認識三年還算要好的朋友同在一處稱是革命機關裘工作，雖然他的職位遠較我高上兩級，但在茲給我的公事條子上依舊一直是承他以朋友之情稱爲「蒙霧兄·蒙霧兄」的。然而自從爲了一椿算大不大算小不小的事情，我們發生過幾次齟齬後，就此在他給我的公事條子中再也無法找到「蒙霧兄」蒼勁端正的字了，却已改爲對我異常熟習的這六個過去怪爲親熱而如今却表示身份貴賤高低的稱呼：「東方蒙霧同志」。</p>
<p>在目前正將「民主」喊得震天價響的中國，我不禁對着這沒落中的「同志」放聲大哭！</p>
<h3>斫殺中的印尼問題</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>從五月廿七日以後劍拔弩張的荷印關係，終於爆發了戰爭，十萬新式裝備的荷蘭陸海空軍與印度尼西亞共和國的土奢軍隊，刻正在相互斫殺之中。</p>
<p>荷蘭統治印尼，已有三百年的歷史，統治者與被總治者中間的利益懸殊。結果釀成熾烈的民族運動，乃成勢听必然的事實。因此，自二十世紀之初，印尼人民反抗荷蘭統治的民族運動，始終就不曾平息過·直到一九三九印尼民族主義黨　同盟成立，方始鞏固民族運動的陣綫，從事有效的活動，使荷蘭政府感到頭痛。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰中，太平洋之戰爆發後，印尼即迅速爲日本所佔領，印尼人民乃加強其建國的遠大計劃。及日本失敗投降，荷蘭復又作捲土重來之計；而印尼七千萬人民却不顧一切的阻撓和壓力，於一九四五八月十七日宣布成立「印度尼西並共和國」，接着於同年十一月成立共和國政府，由索卡諾任總統，掙脫了三百年來的與族總治的鎖鍊。</p>
<p>但是在最初的一年當中，即林第椰蒂協定成立之前，印尼的局面處在荷軍及英軍（藉口帮助遺俘的）雙重壓迫之下，始終是戰爭時斷時續，談判時行時止。直至一九四六年十一月林第椰蒂協定成立，總算由荷方承認印尼共和國的存在，包括爪哇，蘇門答臘，及馬都拉爲共和國的疆土。但共和國僅是印尼合衆國的一部，（由印尼共和國與荷爲東印度其他的島嶼組成）而要與荷蘭本土組成一個荷蘭印尼聯合王國。這樣轉灣抹角，說明荷蘭並沒有慷慨地放棄統治印尼的企圖和宗主權。本年五月二十七日由於對協定的內容解釋不同，荷政府終於向印尼提出最後通牒，要求由荷印雙方聯合組織警備的憲警，及發還荷方產權和開發經濟權等。荷方並堅決聲明，這是荷蘭的最後立塲，印方除了全盤接受外，絕無考慮的餘地。</p>
<p>於是，自五月廿七日以後的荷印局勢，便屬劍拔弩張的異常嚴重。幾經周章，雖由夏利當丁組成了中間性的內閣，答應了荷方聯合組織憲警要求，只是帶有附帶條件，亦使荷方不感滿意。荷蘭內閣乃授權荷印代理總督范莫克相機頒發進攻令，於是印尼的衝突乃不免於本月廿一日爆發。現在，英美兩國對此糾紛深表遺憾，正在謀取斡旋之道；而印尼的索卡諾總統則向聯合國呼籲，要求陪合予以合理的調停。所以，相斫中荷印糾紛發展的前途，尙待英美的態度而決定。</p>
<p>不過，處在印尼的華僑，將近有一百萬人的光景；他們操有印尼商業上的實權，過去在荷印糾紛中，已蒙受過相當的損害。現在，我們以極關懷的情緒，企念着他們的生命與財產的安全。並希望荷印雙方能糾正過去的謬誤，尊重中立國家人民的利益哩</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國大學中的　聽</p>
<p>在多方面說，美國大學對於社會的貢獻比中國任何大學爲多。中國的大學教育，限於少數正規學生，職業公民是無法問津的，而正規學生給功課重重壓迫外，還得經過大考，小考，季考，月考等等的形式桎梏，修業成功之日，也往往就是肺病到第三期的末日，許多高材生在歡天喜地拿到文憑，也就悲悲戚戚地爬上了病床。美國大學教育便不那麼呆板和形式化，高等學府根本很少有大門的，入學也不必經過考試，可以先讀了再說，如果目的不在學分，儘可讓你旁聽，因此除正式學生外，還有各色人等，如律師，經理，商人，公務員，中學教負，老老少少，應有盡有。他們所選的功課，都有他們的職業有關，一面工作，一面進修，如此可以使工作能力更爲精進，政府省却調訓公務人員的麻煩，教室中往往發現七八十歲的老先生老太太，他們活到這般年紀，似已無進修的必要，但他們爲什麼再進學校呢？他們覺得這把年紀，進夜總會已太老，進電影院怕傷了老花眼力，其他游泳，騎馬，跑冰，兜風，都沒有他們的份，但又不甘寂寞，因此到大學裏旁聽，一則可以聽聽權威教授的偉論，二則可認識幾個年靑朋友，解解苦悶，老年人有老成持重的見解，所以碰到討論國際問題時，教授和學生都很尊重老年人的意見。我覺得大學裏沒有冉冉長鬚和鷄皮鶴髮的老學生，大學教育不能算是完備的，不算是成熟的，大學教育是最高的教育，不是年靑的教育。中國大學裏的囂張騷擾，風潮疊出，都是因爲不成熟的綠故，老年人旣不得其門而入大學，祗爲溷跡到廟宇裏或茶坊裏，賢明的教育當局，不想把大學改造，反而把茶坊尊爲公民教育的一種機構，那眞是教育已走進了牛角尖。（三三）</p>
<h3>張魯的失敗</h3>
<p>— 周冷</p>
<p>——魏晋人物雜論之六</p>
<p>以米賊出身，投降政府，曹操還待以客禮，官封至萬戶侯，自己五個兒子和得力親信，均獲重遇的張魯，照批註三國志的宋太中大夫國子博士裴松批評：「張魯雖有善心，要爲敗而後降，今乃寵以萬戶，五子皆封侯，過矣！」言下是認定大不以爲然的。其實，照我看，這正是阿瞞絕頂聰明的地方，値得大書特書的一筆好手法。</p>
<p>因爲，誰也知道，縱貫漢末魏初七八十年間那股以宗教神道拖飾眞相的農民革命力量，正已把當時的統治者地位，搖撼得岌岌可危了的。承繼「黃巾」的政治思想，演變而爲米賊的首領張魯，據三國志魏書，他那時已經「雄據巴漢垂三十年，漢末力不能征。關西民從子午各奔之者數萬家」，力量是十分宏大的。以政府立塲而言，平滅一羣軍閥政客的陰謀叛亂會很容易，但想以此鎭服羣衆的自發力量那是很困難的。因爲前者不過是烏合之衆，以利相聚，自也易以利散；而後者却是立塲不仝，思想信仰，互相對立，不是一下子可以泯除的。曹操正因爲了解了這一點分別，所以才不惜以高官厚爵來勾引，瓦解分化他們。而恰巧又碰到這麼一個銀樣臘槍頭的張魯，結果才迅速功成而返。不然，要是這個對立局面繼續存在下去，則魏晋乃至以後歷史的發展如何，恐怕誰也不能估計到的。</p>
<p>就算以軍事的力量而論吧，曹操之所以能擊敗張魯，即使是當朝的正統文士，也承認這是一件「天祚大魏，魯守自壞」的僥倖之事。魏名臣奏載董昭表里，就有段很好的自白：「武皇帝從降人之辭，說張魯易攻。信以爲然，及往臨履，不如所聞，乃歎曰：他人商度，少如人意。攻陽平山上諸屯，旣不時拔，士卒傷亡日衆，武皇帝意沮，便欲拔軍而還，會前軍夜迷，誤入賊營，賊便退散，猶不信之，惇（夏侯惇）前自見，乃還白，武皇帝進兵定之，幸而克」。則可見以善於用兵的阿瞞，碰到了這班「民軍大叔」，也不得不感到痛頭，所以勝利，是不過靠了偶然的機會才獲得的。</p>
<p>然而，這還不是張魯失敗的原因，米賊的軍心所以如此渙散，主要應該是他們的領導者對自己的事業沒有信心，奮鬬不澈底。陳壽張魯傳就說：「民有地中得王印者，羣下欲尊魯爲王，閻圃諫曰：漢川四面險固，上匡天子，則爲桓侯，次及寳融不失富貴，願且不稱，勿爲禍先。魯從之。……太祖征之，魯欲舉漢中降，其弟衛不肯，率衆數萬拒關堅守。」……太祖以魯有善意，遣人慰喩，拜魯鎭南將軍。」從這里，我們更可知道，米賊之敗，不是敗在曹操他們的征剿，而是敗在張魯的出賣了。當然　，一個首腦人物，意志決心這麼不堅定，一方面保持承認正統第一的思想，一方面又企圖買身投降，抗敵的意志旣不積極，內鬨的事件便容易發生，一經對方壓迫，自然很快打敗仗了。</p>

<h3>靈芝（上）</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>晏花是「祥瑞之物」，靈芝更是道地的國產「瑞草」。牠的所以成爲瑞草，大槪與漢代的識緯思想有關。如「孝經緯」那一類書裏便說起，「德至草木則芝草生，善養老則芝草茂。」漢武帝元封二年，甘泉宮內「產芝，九莖通葉，」因此大赦天下，作芝房之歌，末兩句云：「蔓蔓日茂，芝成靈華。」於是原本祗稱爲「芝」或「芝草」的這種平常植物，便確定了牠的「靈芝」的身分了。</p>
<p>而且，因爲成了「靈芝」，便有種種神奇的傳說附會到了牠的身上。就如說種靈龍，神農經說有五芝：「赤者如珊瑚，白者如截肪，黑者如澤漆，靑者如翠羽，黃者如紫金。」又說有六芝：「靑芝生泰山，赤芝生霍山，黃芝生嵩山，白芝生華山，黑芝生常山，紫芝生高夏山谷，六芝皆六月八日采。」至如抱朴子說：「有石芝，有木芝，有草芝，有肉芝，有菌芝，各有百許種。」那先荒誕不可信的。</p>
<p>自從有了漢武帝宮內產生靈芝的記載，同類的記載便史不絕書：漢明帝永平十七年春，芝生前殿。桓帝建和元年四月，芝草生中黃藏府。唐玄宗天寳七載三月，大同殿柱產玉芝，有神光照殿。肅宗上元二年七月，延英殿御座梁上生王芝，一莖三葉，上製玉靈芝詩。這些都是認作祥瑞之兆，才在史臣的手裏鄭重記載下來的。古今詩話云：「宣和間王將明賜第，旣　以梁生芝草爲奏。車駕臨幸，適久梅雨，潤芝墾地。京師無名子有爲十七字詩曰：「新公新賜第，梁上生芝草，爲甚脫下來？膠少。仁足見歷史的記載，有許多是不可靠的：又如段成式的　陽雜俎云，「屋柱木無故生芝者，白爲喪，赤爲血，黑爲賊，黃爲喜。其形如人面者亡財，如牛馬者遠役，如龜蛇者田蠶耗。」這更給希望室內發現靈芝的人抹一鼻子灰了。</p>
<p>但是在社會上，恭維人家總比咒駡人家好。尤其是在中國，對於皇帝，你敢說一個不字嗎？這樣，靈芝便始終維持了牠祥瑞之物的地位，歷代阿諛之輩，更把牠當作進獻的寳物。宋代的眞宗皇帝，大概特別愛好靈芝，從威平二年（公曆九九九年（到乾興元年一〇二二年）這二十四年之間，在宋史五行志裏，差不多每年都有關於靈芝的記載。如大中祥符元年（一〇〇八年）八月王欽若獻芝草八千一百三十九本，九月趙安仁來獻五色金玉丹紫芝八千七百十一本，十月欽若等又獻泰山芝草三萬八千五十本。六年十月「丁謂來朝，獻芝草三萬七千一百八本，飾以仙人寳禽異獸之狀。十一月又獻九萬五千一百本。明年車駕至眞源，民有詣行　獻者，又一萬八千本。」像這樣大量的徵集，眞是盛况空前絕復的。</p>

<h3>嘉州六記之　蘇子樓與大佛寺</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>從烏尤寺到大佛寺去，可以先看看蘇子樓。據說這是有宋一代詞人和散文家的蘇東坡曾經在此讀書之地。東坡是此地附近的嵋山人，如果後人作的關於他的傳記並不是胡鬧，那末，像他那樣的人，在遙個地方訊一個時期的書，這事絕對的可能。所以，我決不懷疑這古蹟是揑造。曲折下山，喚一隻小船渡過了一條小溪，又從沙灘爬上土坡、再轉過一處類似山谷的地形，又從叢莽間的石級走上去，繞幾個非繞不可的灣，寫着「蘇子樓」二個字的大門，被我們找到了。對於多數人，畢竟詩詞迷人的力量，不如神話迷人的力量大；所以，這大門比較烏尤寺的大門，窮酸多了。</p>
<p>通過這小學校大門式的大門，穿過稍加以修理的院子，即一座看來是破敗的危樓，便是「蘇子樓」。藜着狹窄的木扶梯走上去，爬到樓上，空敞的小棋上，破舊的神櫥中，塑看東坡和他老弟的像，粉面如垔，藍花如碧，手裏拿着書卷，有教授先生的模樣，淸疎的鬍子，撲素的頭巾，頗有對人講學的神氣。但這樓上並沒有許多人來光顧，在這裏稍坐片時的，除了我那個朋友外，只有三個剝花生吃的女學生。這樓，三面不避風雨，一面的壁上，題滿了打油詩。這時候太陽已經排雲而出，照着樓下庭中的花木，使人知道，已經到了晚秋的季節。</p>
<p>女太太和小孩子擠上樓來了，我知道她們腦子裏並沒有東坡，而是到這裏來趕一趕熱鬧，橘子殼和花生皮，於是成了對於東坡的祭品。這裏實在沒有雅趣可尋，再從扶梯走下，去看一看剛纔沒有注意的殿堂，殿堂上也供看同樣神氣的塑像，左側神壇上，有一個翹脚的魁星，魁星是「文神」，東坡是「文人」將他們聚在一堂，而名曰「蘇子樓」，可以想見當初設計這廟的人物，和他的用心了。</p>
<p>殊子樓和蘇東坡的毫無關係，正像東坡和遊客的毫無關係一樣，我毫無感想地覺到古今同樣的無聊，已經有喝茶解渴的必要。</p>
<p>走出蘇子樓，在山頂山上的茶園小坐，這茶園，正在大佛的頭髮旁邊，隆隆地一個回教堂園屋頂似的雪白的一座，是拱出山頭的佛頂，走到石欄邊去，可以看見大佛的頭部，這頭正豎在兩個山頭的石縫中，有足以客一個人站立的耳孔的耳朶，是看得最淸楚的部分，從頭部往下面看，佛身正像一座略作人形之狀的石壁，直插入兩山之間的凹處的江裏面去了。</p>
<p>據大佛寺的碑誌，這佛身高三十六丈，目廣二丈，頭圍十丈，可以想見他的高大。正對着大渡河和岷江匯合的急流，昂昂然有讓你冲來，決不生氣的洪量。他脚下的江水顯然是駭人的特別的深，如果船翻了下去，大約是無從搭救了。據碑誌，這佛是唐代一個僧人開始募化修造，經過幾乎半個朝代的時間，纔竣了功，因爲當初這裏的急流，常常掀翻了渡船，是一處難於航行的險地，僧人於是在這裏作了如此偉大的設計，仰佛力的庇護，從此這裏可以舟行如　了。這說法，　然是宗教家的一篇文章；他是在山形和水勢之間，研究到永　的原因，　出了救治的方法，特正　着急流的山磯，聲出一個很大的焰隙，讓水冲到這裏來，　和了他的力量，而復用一尊偶像壯了人仰的胆子。因此，他的勞續和效果，一直保留到如今。</p>
<p>這佛實在是完全　石而成的，也可以說，在石山上盤出一個大空洞，又將最後凸出的部分，鑒成了佛，在沒有機器和炸藥的當時，完成這一個大工程，眞不知道苦了多少人力。想到逍裏，漢唐時代的眞正的中國人的精神，活躍在我的面前，坐在菜館裏的我和許多人，到了對於國家大事也已經焦慮，害怕到不敢想也不敢談的程度，還不慚愧嗎？</p>
<p>從石佛的後腦繞過去，瞻仰大佛寺，這佛廟的前部比鳥尤寺較爲古撲，但後面有洋式建築的法堂，彷彿是造起不久的藏經樓。在更後的處所，我們想在這裏買些碑帖，走進大殿左側的客堂，那裏有一個三十左右歲的和尙，在那裏。他好像是當着値班的職務，但却是不願誠心招待客人的態度。看來是一個神經質的性格，不住地睞着兩眼，應信客人的扳談，朋友說不要，他立刻又拏了進去，這不善營業的和尙，或者正是一個愛讀佛經的書呆子。我們覺得不必在那裏多坐，從經過的故道走出大門去，覺得連和尙，也比古代的沒出息得多，中國近代的和尙，不也是中國的近代人嗎？</p>
<p>露水已經在船上凝結了，許多遊客都已舉　歸去。然而我們還不願離去，我們還要伴着這寂寞的月亮，在這美麗得出奇的湖上之夜裏，吟唱一些古老的詩句……。</p>

<h3>月夜泛舟</h3>
<p>— 培茵</p>
<p>湖濱散記</p>
<p>你可曾到過杭州呢？你可曾架着一條小船，當一個沁凉而月明的夏夜，邀一二個知音人遊蕩在湖心嗎？這詩一般美麗的景色，是够使人忘掉日間的炎熱與煩惱的。</p>
<p>曾有一些夜晚，我們自架着小船，到湖心去尋求凉爽與幻想；享受這難得的佳景。月亮高高地掛在半天，夜風在湖面吹拂，捲起了一陣陣微細的銀波。</p>
<p>小船緩慢地行駛着，我們輕輕地打着小漿，低唱着愛克萊（B．D．Ackley）的「湖上月色」什麼地方飄送過來一陣小提琴的聲音，那麼幽柔地，還夾着一些青年男女的悠揚的吟唱。慢慢地，那載滿了靑春與愉快的小船從我們的左方橫過去了；隱約地，我看到那船上有幾們健碩的年輕人的影子。</p>
<p>我們的船穿行過一個橋洞，大家都驟然地感到陰凉了一下，船頭在水面激起的聲音從橋壁反射下來，那麼陰森地發出沙沙的聲音。橋的那邊，湖面上舖滿了荷葉，密密地連成了一大片，船困難地從荷葉間的空隙中划禍去，船舷不時地碰聲着葉梗。荷花已盛放了，濃郁的花香浮蕩在湖面，那些碩大的花朶在黯淡的夜的空氣裏搖曳。我竟爲着這濃烈的花香所薰醉了。……</p>
<p>夜深了，湖上更顯得凉爽，寂寞的月亮高掛在太空，傻傻地望着投在湖心的她底影子。四周的山色很濃，一些山農的寺院，別墅，還閃爍着疏落的燈光，什麼人在這樣的深夜，還沒有睡去呢？……我不禁遐想着。</p>
<h3>望（兩章）</h3>
<p>— 江野</p>
<p>塔</p>
<p>我的窗外站着一座塔。我站在窗下，便能望見它。它是老早以前就站在那裏的。——</p>
<p>它古舊舊它蒼老；它破敗。</p>
<p>我想：總有一天，它會突然轟的倒塌：……</p>
<p>沒有歌頌。我望着它。我是在對它作着　吊。</p>
<p>這塔呵，它已經歷了不知多少的風雨，刧難。縱有它輝煌的過去；但一切都已成陳蹟了。如此的殘存，只有岑寂，只有凄</p>
<p>因此，我是在爲這一塔的倒壩而祈禱著了。</p>
<p>倒場，是這塔的必然的運命。倒塌，也許還是這塔的一種幸</p>
<p>山</p>
<p>望着站在我窗外的山，我便變得沉鬱了。我有著太多關於這山的想念。</p>
<p>孩子們在山上放風箏，鄉民們去山上放牛牧羊，採伐柴草，而我從小是這山的經常的游客，處處可找到我童年脚跡的留痕。</p>
<p>自從，鬼子兵在這山上升起了它的膠藥旗，便被佔作軍事禁地，不准人走近它一步。</p>
<p>如今呢？鬼子兵被逐走了的如今呢？</p>
<p>如今，還不是個太平時代：</p>
<p>孩子們不來放風箏了，鄕民們沒有半羊可以放收，也不再來採伐柴草了，而我從遙遠的南方回來不久，又將去向另一個遙遠的地方了。</p>

<p>「辦完了，秘書長。」大　子這才行了一個掃射敬禮，探手從衣袋內取出一張字條，遞了過來；又回身把乎中包裏，安放在另外一張案桌上，背着我們，對小老虎扮了一個鬼臉，又打了一個手式。他以爲我在看着字條，沒留意他的舉動。其實那字條我一到眼即已明白，這時已經移過眼睛，看他弄了些什麼食品來。從那鬼鬼祟祟的行動看來，我可以猜到那些東西，雖不精美，大槪不壞，而且也不少；因他同小老虎，一大一小，洽好是一對考勤　。</p>
<p>「秘書長，報告慰，」大傻子這才想起了還有報吿；「密電都發出去了，北平當時就有電話來，請秘書長回家就打電過去，有要緊公事……」：又指了指我手上那張字條，「那是劉事務員收到的，早晨六點二十五分。……」</p>
<p>「還有什麼嗎？」我知道他的心事一大半寄托在那包食物上了；心不在焉，也許會扔下一兩件消息；所以提醒他一點。</p>
<p>「還有……是……龍虎台已經接觸了，小接觸，只有步槍，輕機槍，試　性質。前後只有一小時。中國守軍，把這邊倭鬼換了一頓，倭兒這邊很有些死傷。…」</p>
<p>「還有什麼嗎？」我又追問一句。</p>
<p>「……這邊現在已經調了大隊飛機，五十座野戰砲，另有馬隊兩大隊；下午六點，預備攻擊中國守軍，左右兩羣。……中國方面，器械太舊了。」</p>
<p>「還有……？」我試探着再問一句。</p>
<p>「……臨動身，我把『傢伙』給拾掇起來，叫小劉，二和尙，二和尙的女人分兩班輪流看守。－二和尙和他女人，都說有人在注意咱們的『號子；小劉』宿沒睡，害怕有亂子，所以……」所謂「傢伙，」指電訊機而說。</p>
<p>「那辦得很好」大傻子這一着確辦得好；「小心沒有錯，」是一句通俗格言，我不能不誇讚他一下。「沒有話哪嗎？」我認爲大傻子的報告，應該結束了。至於設有人注意的話，那是杜二賢夫婦神經過敏；我認爲我們旣以「十五號」姿態出塲，倭方普通特字人員，絕對不會注意。如有人注意，必是松組高級人物，他們神出鬼沒，出手毒辣，如有行動，也不會教杜二落眼，可想而知；所以我沒有追問。</p>
<p>「還有一件事！」大傻子有些吞吞吐吐地；一可不是咱們裏面的……」</p>
<h3>海濱之歌</h3>
<p>— 魯海</p>
<p>漁船</p>
<p>凈藍的海波上，白帆在渺茫的飄蕩着，太陽才剛升起呢，早出的漁船已隨風遠航了。</p>
<p>居住在這海濱，整日眺望着遠行的漁船，心底默想起前途的風浪？</p>
<p>幸福的海國居民喲，你在漁舟上也會有着塵世的汚濁嗎？</p>

<h3>Wei Envoy Accompanies Delegation to Fly to Peiping, Collects Information on North and Northeast China, Investigation Results Will Be Reported to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Wei Demai's news advisor Watson, on the 21st, told reporters that the Wei envoy delegation, apart from Chief Secretary Lieutenant Colonel Herkins, the messenger Sergeant First Class Pope, and stenographers Sergeant First Class Gaistone and one other person remaining in Nanjing to organize conversation records and maintain contact with various parties, will all take a special plane from Dajiaochang Cemetery to Peiping in the afternoon of August 1st. Regarding the rumors that the delegation will go to Suiyuan for inspection, he expressed no knowledge, and said that the trip will only last about a week. The cities that have been decided to visit are Tianjin, Fengyang, and Qingdao. Whether to go to some other important and permitted areas will be determined according to the actual time. As for Lushun and Dalian, it has been decided not to visit. Watson himself has long yearned for Peiping and expressed great excitement about his first trip to the ancient capital. His amiable and considerate manner has created a good impression among the press in the past two weeks. He personally considers it a great pleasure to get to know many Chinese journalist colleagues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 31st Dispatch] The Wei envoy delegation of eleven people has scheduled to arrive in Peiping tomorrow afternoon. Li Zongren and Wu Qiewei will return together. It has been decided here that the Beijing Hotel and the Chairman's Headquarters in the Houyuanensi Temple will be the residences for Wei. However, the US Consulate is also preparing accommodation, and Wei will choose one of the places tomorrow. It is heard that Wei, in addition to attending banquets hosted by Li Zongren and He Siyuan, does not intend to engage in many social activities. He has scheduled a banquet at the Summer Palace on the 2nd. Wei has decided to stay in Peiping for three days, fly to Tianjin on the morning of the 4th, stay for one day, and leave Tianjin on the 5th to fly to Fengyang, then pass through Qingdao on the 7th and return to Nanjing. In Zhangjiakou, it is heard that preparations for welcome are also being made, but whether they will go is yet to be determined. The education sector here plans to submit a letter to the Wei envoy, the content of which is kept secret.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tianjin 31st Dispatch] The Wei envoy will arrive in Tianjin on Monday and stay for thirty hours before heading to Shenyang. While in Tianjin, they will reside in the US Consulate. Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, the US Consulate, the American Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of social organizations will all go to the Quan Field to welcome them. A reporter asked Smith, the US Consul in this area, whether he was prepared to submit a report on the situation in Tianjin to the Wei envoy? Smith did not answer, only saying to ask the Wei envoy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei 31st Dispatch] The authorities here are actively preparing to welcome Special Envoy Wei Demai to Taiwan for inspection. His residence in Taipei will be selected as the Caoshan Sugar Company Club.</p>
<p>Wei Envoy Expressed in Nanjing: Always Admired Chairman</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Wei Demai said to a visitor on the morning of the 31st that the mission of this trip is of an absolutely independent nature. Although President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall appointed him and instructed the main points of the work, they did not pre-determine his working process and attitudes. He is investigating the current situation in China from the standpoint of a friend of China, accepting information and opinions, distinguishing truth from falsehood, summarizing and classifying, and then making independent judgments to obtain an accurate conclusion for the reference of the US government, so as to make decisions to help China solve various difficulties. Wei said that since 1944, when he succeeded General Stilwell as Chief of Staff to Chairman Chiang, he has deeply admired Chairman Chiang. Even today, although the situation in China has formed an unfortunate split due to various factors, he still believes that Chairman Chiang will surely lead the Chinese people to overcome all internally created difficulties, just as he had led them through external aggression and hardship. He believes that China's biggest problem is that some important people at home and abroad are unable to learn about certain facts. For example, in the winter of 1944, regarding the dangerous situation of enemy cavalry entering Guizhou, some subordinates of Chairman Chiang did not report the truth in time. It was not until Wei personally inspected the battlefield and reported back that he fully knew everything. The purpose of this trip is not only to inform Truman and Marshall of the current situation in China, but also to report all the facts to Chairman Chiang. He agreed that Chiang should not only be the leader of the Kuomintang, but should transcend everything and be the leader of all parties and the people of the whole country. He also agreed that the Kuomintang should open up its regime, and other parties should unconditionally share political responsibilities. Wei said that he has met Chairman Chiang twice in Nanjing for ten days, but has not yet talked about practical issues. He decided to have a long talk with Chairman Chiang again after returning from his trip to the north.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 30th/31st Dispatch] A senior government official told a United Press reporter: "Wei Demai is very capable, and he knows the situation in China like the back of his hand. We don't need to point out everything about the Communists to him, he already knows it well. The Wei Demai delegation can visit the war front these days, and they will be able to fully understand the support that the Chinese Communists receive from Moscow. It is hoped that the 'Friends of China' will not disregard the current threat and repeat the same mistakes as the Japanese invasion." It is reported that Wei Demai has abandoned his efforts to contact the Chinese Communists, believing it to be impossible, but he still hopes to obtain any information submitted by the Chinese Communists.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Middle Party League Submit Memorandum to Wei, Content Divided into Three Major Parts: Politics, Military, Economy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th/31st Dispatch] The US Embassy announced that Wei Demai had met with several people on the morning of the 30th/31st. The main guests were Lin Donghai, Guo Weixiang, Zhao Maowen, Gan Xian and other four Standing Committee members of the Middle Party League. In addition, Major General Liu Xuesong of the General Command of the Tenth/Eleventh War Zone and Major General Zeng Xigui, Director of the Hearing and Police Department of the General Bureau of Finance, also paid a short visit. Wei devoted most of the day to consulting with his advisors to review the large amount of information and documents collected in recent days, and also shifted some of his attention to planning his upcoming trip to North and Northeast China. Wei had lunch during work hours and had dinner with the Minister.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Representatives of the Chinese Middle Party League visited Wei on the morning of the 31st from 11:11 to 12:30 for a long talk, discussing the current political, economic, and educational issues in China. During the conversation, they mentioned that the democratic economy of the Soviet Union is a collective system, the United States is free competition, and China's Principle of People's Livelihood is quite suitable for the national conditions, and talked about China's Doctrine of the Mean. Finally, they discussed China's education issues. They had a conversation for more than an hour, but had not finished speaking, so they agreed to talk again with the party representatives after his trip to Peiping and return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Lin Donghai, chairman of the Middle Party League, which is composed of the National Freedom Party, the Democratic Rule Party, the People's Livelihood Progressive Party, and the Moderation Party, and four standing committee members including Zhao Weiwen, told reporters after visiting the Wei envoy that they had provided Wei with a memorandum containing three major parts: politics, economy, and military: (1) In the political aspect, they believed that the two major barriers in domestic and international politics</p>
<h3>Grain Conference Concluded Yesterday, Revised Implementation Measures for Requisition and Loan Passed, Quotas for Requisition and Loan in Jiangsu and Sichuan Provinces Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The 36th Annual Grain Conference concluded on the 31st. Before the closing ceremony, the third general meeting was held, attended by 75 people, including provincial chairmen, righteousness chiefs, and heads of grain bureaus. Wang Yunwu chaired, and Grain Chief Yu Feipeng reported on the results of discussions in various provinces, stating briefly: The original plan for this year's grain demand was 45 million dan, but after discussions with various provinces, the total of requisition and loan was only over 30 million dan, short of over 10 million dan. It was decided that the part to be purchased would be purchased from overseas. Then, Yu read out the revised plan for the implementation of requisition and loan of grain, discussed it in terms of wording, made slight revisions, and passed it (original text see another article). After the meeting, the closing ceremony was held, still chaired by Wang Yunwu, who delivered the closing remarks, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The Ministry of Food has scheduled to convene a seminar on grain business review for the heads of grain bureaus of various provinces on the 2nd (that is, the land tax conference), with a meeting period of half a day to one day.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The quotas for requisition and loan in Jiangsu Province have been determined. The principle is one part requisition and half loan. The loan amount is 24 million yuan, 6 sheng per yuan, totaling 1.44 million dan, doubled for the requisition amount, excluding public grain. [Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 31st Dispatch] In order to strengthen the requisition work, the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau has replaced the heads of grain bureaus in various places who have not performed well in requisition work. Zhu Shaoqing has been reassigned as the deputy head of the Suzhou Grain Bureau, Yang Dehuai has been reassigned as the deputy head of the Yixing Grain Bureau, and Quan Xingzu has been reassigned as the deputy head of the Qingpu Grain Bureau. [Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 31st Dispatch] Regarding the transfer of food (including husked rice, wheat, and flour) from other ports through Zhenjiang to South and North China, it is now heard that the provincial government has approved the Ministry of Food's telegram, which must first be reported to the Ministry of Food for approval before shipment, otherwise it will not be allowed to leave the province.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu 31st Dispatch] Sichuan's original quota for requisition this year had already been determined. Later, in order to mobilize for suppressing the rebellion, the central government decided to requisition and loan again, and convened a national grain conference. It has now been decided that Sichuan's quota for requisition this year will be readjusted according to the following principles: (1) The total amount of requisition and loan is 9 million shi. (2) Universal requisition, without conversion to legal tender. (3) Grain loans and public grain due this year will be purchased by the central government at market price. The provincial government has now divided the 154 counties and cities in Sichuan into three phases, starting requisition from September 1st, and has scheduled a provincial administrative conference in mid-August to discuss requisition mobilization and other issues.</p>
<h3>Provincial Chairmen in Nanjing Hold Provincial Administration Talks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 30th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has twice invited provincial chairmen in Nanjing to hold administrative seminars to study provincial administration reform plans. It has now been decided to hold a third consultation meeting at 9 pm on the 31st to continue exchanging opinions. , will inevitably lead to a third world war. Therefore, it is advocated that China should only have an independent central government. This government should include middle parties and free members of all parties. The current transitional government should be expanded and reorganized. This autumn's general election should also be open to all parties, not limited to the three parties in power. The Northeast issue must be resolved. It is hoped that the United States will pay attention to it and assist China in recovering the Northeast and obtaining the victory of the eight-year war of resistance. (2) In the economic aspect, after eight years of war of resistance, followed by civil strife, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, wealth is concentrated in a few bureaucratic capitalists, and fiscal policy has not been established based on economic realities, resulting in an unbalanced budget and inflation. Therefore, it is suggested that loans should be used and the gold standard should be adopted to reform and stabilize the monetary system. Effective measures should be taken immediately to curb price increases to maintain people's livelihood. Personnel and systems should be overhauled in both aspects. Economic and financial institutions should allow private capital (especially overseas Chinese capital) and foreign capital to develop fully, encourage foreign trade, and promote economic prosperity. (3) In the military aspect, they believe that no political party should have an independent army, otherwise civil strife will inevitably occur due to disputes over political rights, and international wars will be triggered due to the opposition of ideological barriers. Therefore, the reform of China's military must aim at eliminating the possession of independent armies by political parties. In the conclusion of the memorandum, they pointed out: (1) "Defend independence and territorial integrity. The Yalta secret agreement decided that China should give up certain interests to the Soviet Union in order to maintain peace in the Far East. However, today's situation proves that China has suffered significant losses. The Northeast issue has not been resolved and will endanger world peace. The United States participated in the Yalta secret consultation and has a responsibility to assist China in recovering the Northeast. (2) Since the victory, due to the rebellion of the Chinese Communists, the government has restricted some freedoms of the people. The progress made in the eight-year war of resistance has now regressed. (3) The problem with Chinese politics is that many talented people are excluded from government affairs. If this is not reflected upon in the future, it will be difficult to talk about innovation. (4) China must obtain large-scale loans, otherwise there will be a terrible economic bankruptcy in six months. [Agence France-Presse London 30th Dispatch] Regarding General Wei Demai's mission to the Far East for investigation, The Times of London commented: General Wei Demai is not only going to China for food adjustment, but also to Korea for investigation. The US-Soviet Mixed Committee in Korea has encountered many difficulties and has failed to organize a Korean provisional government. The point of disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union lies in the word "provisional". Therefore, officials from the United States and the Soviet Union have failed to reach an understanding. There are many political parties in Korea at present. In terms of the Communist Party, the Soviet Union seems to be still trying to implement its traditional doctrines in Korea, insisting that communism is the best way to achieve democracy. Therefore, it is gratifying that General Wei Demai has been ordered by President Truman to go to China for investigation, and Korea has also been included in his investigation scope.</p>
<h3>Coal Production Conference Opens in Nanjing This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The Coal Production Increase Conference is scheduled to open at 9 am on the 1st. As of the 31st, more than 20 units have registered, with more than 50 representatives. More than 40 proposals and plans have been received. The conference will last for three days.</p>
<h3>Opening of Trade with Japan Agreed in Principle by the Central Political Committee, Business Inspection Group to Japan in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The special meeting convened by the Central Political Committee to discuss the issue of opening trade with Japan was held at 9 am on the 31st, chaired by Dai Chuanxian. After more than four hours of debate, a few committee members reorganized the text, and decided in principle to agree to open trade with Japan, but its nature should belong to guiding trade. At the same time, three measures were decided: (1) The selection of personnel and the number of people to be sent to the Japanese business inspection group should be decided by the Executive Yuan, and they should depart before August 15th. (2) The types and quantities of imported and exported goods should be determined by our government according to its needs. (3) Some necessary goods should be designated by the government as compensation goods. The committee members who spoke at the meeting and considered whether to open trade with Japan focused on the crisis facing us at present, fearing that they could not withstand the onslaught of Japanese goods being dumped. Sun Ke also spoke, believing that after the opening, we should still adopt strict controls to prevent Japan from making a comeback and realizing its ambitions for aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai discussed the opening of trade with Japan, saying in essence: Passively opposing the opening is not the best policy. The most important thing is to examine the nature and use of Japanese goods and decide whether to allow them to be imported. Sending commercial representatives to Japan can be carried out at the same time as examining commodities. China's current situation may not have a large supply of coal and iron to Japan, so there is no need to worry about using raw materials to aid the enemy. After the implementation of the commodity inspection method, the import surplus of trade can be prevented. As for the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods, there is no need to worry too much because Japan lacks merchant ships and commercial institutions. Increasing the number of barter trades with Japan by the China Trust Bureau is a very good idea. At the same time, commodities can be classified according to their nature, with state-owned commodities being state-owned and privately-operated commodities being privately-operated.</p>
<h3>Legislative Member Jian Guansan Discusses the Key to Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>Our Country Has an Organic Countermeasure</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Legislative member Jian Guansan told reporters on the 31st regarding trade with Japan that even if trade with Japan is opened now, because the peace treaty has not yet been signed, the types and quantities of imports can be subject to strict quota restrictions. The serious consequences are not now, but in the future. If it is not opened now, but after the peace treaty is established in one or two years, it will still have to be opened. Therefore, the key to the issue of trade with Japan is not only that Japan's future industrial equipment will remain above the level of 1930 to 1937, which poses a permanent threat to our national defense and people's livelihood. Our industrial and commercial circles have not protested sternly against this, and are only discussing the current issue of trade opening, which is indeed a case of abandoning the essential for the trivial. Second, the largest overseas markets for China and Japan are both in Southeast Asia. We should submit a concrete plan to the Far Eastern Commission to restrict Japan's activities in Southeast Asia to prevent its economic imperialism from reviving. Third, we must deeply reflect on ourselves. Relying solely on the export of raw materials is a backward economic performance with no future. We must devote ourselves to the rationalization movement of industry, that is, the modernization of machinery, the standardization of products, and the official pricing, so that we have the qualifications to open up overseas markets. Fourth, Japan's rigorous starvation export and its determination to revive are enough to warn our country's officials and the public, while the extravagance and luxury in our big cities and the sluggish atmosphere of society are in stark contrast. In comparison, how can we stand on our own? Fifth, Japan currently has 330,000 spindles, and Meng Zong is planning to expand Japanese spindles to 6 million. Japan itself also has a four-year plan to expand silk, all of which are greatly detrimental to our country's textile industry and silk industry. Our country should have organic countermeasures internally and externally to avoid harm in the future. Sixth, the profit from Japanese goods smuggling into the country through Hong Kong and Macao is more lucrative than transporting and selling British and American goods. This should also be brought under control.</p>
<h3>Third Quarter Import Classification Numbers, National Economic Commission Adjusts Quotas, Foreign Exchange Will Be Given to Develop National Industry, Property Donation Case Submitted to Subcommittee for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The National Economic Commission held its ninth meeting at 3 pm on the 31st, chaired by President Zhang. Important proposals included the "Property Donation Levy Plan" submitted by the Ministry of Finance. According to the Ministry of Finance, the name "Special Donation for National Construction" is easily misunderstood as a voluntary donation, and it is feared that the change of name will affect the actual efficiency of future collection, resulting in the loss of the original purpose of establishing this tax. However, the original "One-Time Property Tax" is different from the meaning of the temporary capital donation, so it is renamed "Property Donation" to correct the hearing and facilitate collection. The content starts from 500 million yuan and adopts a progressive method. The supervisory body is organized by representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and public opinion organs, social elites, and financial experts. Each province and city establishes a branch, with the provincial chairman and mayor as the chairman. Because the content of this case is numerous, it will be submitted to the Finance Subcommittee for preliminary review. Another important case discussed at the meeting was the proposal submitted by the Import Management Committee regarding the allocation of import classification quotas for the third quarter. The committee members greatly adjusted the distribution of imports for the third quarter (August, September, and October) based on the principle of cherishing foreign exchange and reducing unnecessary imports. Wang Yunwu advocated reducing the amount of kerosene, Li Jingji advocated reducing the amount of cotton, Jian Guansan advocated reducing the amount of tobacco leaves and gasoline, and increasing the amount of Zhou Pei instruments, aircraft parts, and buses. Chen Fang advocated reducing the amount of wool. As a result, adjustments were made according to the above opinions, reducing a total of 7.37 million US dollars, and 500,000 US dollars of the reduced amount will be used as foreign exchange for purchasing foreign painting instruments. In the future, foreign exchange supply will be used to develop national industry. For production equipment and parts, it will be increased from 1.6 million US dollars per month to 2 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>Details of Fu Zhong and Other Company Incidents to Be Announced Soon, Responsible Authorities Currently Collecting Information</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Feng City News] Since the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai listed that Fu Zhong, Yang Yu and other companies violated import and export regulations and applied to the National Bank for a large amount of foreign exchange to import prohibited goods, the authorities of Yangzi and Fu Zhong companies published a large advertisement on the 31st with relevant statements. In order to clarify the details of the National Bank's approval of foreign exchange, a Central News Agency reporter visited senior officials of the National Bank on the 31st. According to reports, the total amount of our country's exchange settlement is related to the country's foreign exchange resources, so it cannot be announced. However, the central government attaches great importance to the Fu Zhong and Yangzi incidents. The responsible authorities have now started to collect as much information as possible from relevant parties, and it is expected that details will be announced soon. It will not be difficult to find out the actual situation. Before this bank receives the order from the Ministry of Finance, I have no right to disclose any news to the outside world. Regarding the import of prohibited goods by Yangzi, Fuzhong and other companies, the reporter visited Zhang Fuyun, director of the Import Management Office, again on the 31st, but Zhang was out on official business. According to the person in charge of the office, the issuance of import permits must be handled in accordance with regulations and legal procedures. The Jianghai Customs also needs a permit to allow merchants to import goods. The approval of merchant permits is impartial and there is no favoritism. The automobile import rules stipulate that the original price in 1942 should be within 1,200 US dollars and the number of seats should be limited to 7. The original price is based on the standard of the manufacturer selling to the car dealer, and it must be discounted according to the age. Regarding the approval of wireless radio imports, those who settle foreign exchange at the official price must have placed their orders before November 17, 35, and shipped them out before November 30. If free foreign exchange is used, only those shipped out before December 30 last year are valid.</p>
<h3>Actual Amount of Foreign Exchange Purchased by Fu Zhong and Other Three Companies</h3>
<p>Central Daily News of Nanjing Corrects Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The Central Daily News of Nanjing published the actual amount of foreign exchange purchased by Fu Zhong, Yangzi and other companies on the 31st. It corrected the record of the newspaper on the 29th and made two statements: (The following is the original text of the Central Daily News)</p>
<p>(1) Our newspaper's reporter has not seen the original documents of the investigation reports of the Ministries of Finance and Economics, so the sections recorded are different from the original documents.</p>
<p>(2) In the number of foreign exchange purchased by each company recorded in this newspaper, there are several places where the decimal point is missing, so that when other newspapers reprinted it, the decimal point was also missing. Check—</p>
<p>The foreign exchange purchased by Fu Zhong Company is 1,537,787.113 US dollars.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange purchased by Yangzi Ten Company is 1,806,910.69 US dollars.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange purchased by China Construction Bank is 877.62 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Measures for Tax Collection and Grain Loans</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 31] The implementation measures for the 36th year of land tax grain collection and grain loan, has been amended and passed by the third plenary session of the Grain Conference on the 31st. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Regarding tax collection and loans: (1) In order to meet the needs of the national mobilization to suppress the rebellion, this year's land tax in all provinces and cities should still focus on the collection of physical objects and grain loans as much as possible. However, in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and a few areas in various provinces with inconvenient transportation and insufficient grain production, the land tax and grain loans may be converted into legal tender at the grain price of the two months before the collection was started, subject to approval. The areas where legal tender is converted and the conversion standards shall be determined by the Ministry of Food. (2) The principal and interest of grain bonds due this year shall be offset by the central government's grain loan, and no grain bonds shall be issued for grain loans this year, and no interest shall be calculated. From 1952, it will be offset in five years equally. (3) The amount of land tax to be levied and the standards for collection in each province and city shall still be handled in accordance with the original plan agreed upon by the Ministry of Food and the provinces. The principle of grain loan is to borrow one for every one collected. If there is a reduction or exemption due to disaster, it shall be handled in accordance with the law, and shall be reported for approval. No reduction shall be requested without authorization. (4) Provincial and county (city) public grain will be collected along with the land tax, and the amount shall be 30% of the actual collection as a principle. (5) The land tax in each province and city shall still be collected on the approved date, and shall not be extended without approval. (6) If the land tax serial tickets have not been printed in the format previously issued by the Ministry of Food, a "Loan" column should be added after "Collection". Those who have already been printed in the format should add a stamp on each link of the original serial ticket: "Loaned this year (grain) (wheat), □ stone □ bucket □ liter □ combine", and collect it at the same time as the collection of public grain. (7) The land tax in all provinces, counties, and cities must be fully collected within three months after the start of collection. If it is not paid in full after the deadline, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 16, 17, 18, and 19 of the Wartime Land Tax Collection Regulations. In areas where legal tender is converted, in addition to doubling the late payment penalty, the conversion standard may be adjusted.</p>
<p>B. Regarding allocation and purchase: (1) All grain loans from provinces and cities shall be remitted to the central government. The land tax portion shall still be in accordance with the current financial revenue and expenditure system, with 30% for the central government, 20% for the province, and 50% for the county (city) in each province; 40% for the central government and 60% for the city in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Provincial public grain will be divided equally between the province and the county, and all public grain in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan will belong to the city. (2) The physical objects obtained from the land tax collection belonging to the provincial and county local governments will be purchased by the central government and used for overall allocation (provincial, county, and city public grain will still be used by local governments and will not be purchased). The purchase methods are as follows: 1. The purchase quantity shall be agreed upon by the Ministry of Food and the provinces at one time and divided equally into four periods for valuation and payment. 2. The price shall be determined by region based on the grain price in August, November, February next year, and May, based on one-quarter of the total quantity. 3. The payment shall be made in September, December, March next year, and June according to the amount payable in each period. 4. The month of valuation and payment for wheat collection provinces may be advanced according to the collection period. (3) The grain obtained from the collection and loan of grain in various provinces (including the purchase of provincial and county grain) shall be used for military grain as a priority. Without approval, it shall not be used without authorization. If the central government's collected and loaned grain and the purchased provincial and county grain are still insufficient for military grain needs, they shall be transferred from neighboring provinces. If there is no grain available for transfer, or the transferred grain is still insufficient for military grain needs, the Ministry of Food shall purchase it at the market price in the required or other grain-producing areas with cash to make up for the shortage.</p>
<p>C. Regarding agency expenses: (1) Provincial grain bureaus shall, depending on the number of currency-collecting counties, streamline the allocation of personnel with reference to the organizational structure issued by the ministry in the 35th year. (2) All physical object-collecting counties shall set up land and grain bureaus and township offices and storage warehouses. The number of settings and the staffing shall be planned and allocated by the provincial land and grain bureaus within the total number of people set by the ministry, and shall not exceed it.

(5) The collection expenses required by the currency-collecting counties and cities, including the land tax list and the printing costs of serial tickets, shall still be shared by the central government and the provincial, county, and city governments in proportion to the income. Among them, the expenses to be allocated shall be paid by the county and city governments within 5% of the central government's share of the collection, and shall be included in the county and city budgets.

<h3>### The National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party: A Fierce Debate</h3>
<p>Attempt to Mediate Internal Strife Fails</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party once again missed an opportunity to resolve internal disputes yesterday. On July 27, through the mediation of Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Junmai and Wu Xianzi met at the International Hotel to discuss a plan to eliminate internal disputes. As a result, three points were agreed upon: (1) Restore the party membership of those who were expelled. (2) Cancel the Reform Committee. (3) Reformists participate in this National Congress. At that time, both parties expressed their agreement and signed the record of the conversation as evidence. However, this matter was not mentioned during the daily meetings of the National Congress. Zhang Junmai hoped that Wu Xianzi could attend the National Congress and make a formal proposal. At 6 pm yesterday, Mr. Wu was invited to the headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party, but declared at the meeting that he was not attending, but only came to report. At that time, Representative Li Weichen stood up and spoke, saying that Wu Xianzi was welcomed to the meeting as vice chairman, but hoped that Mr. Wu would formally sign in and then discuss the mediation matter, and detailed the origin of the party's internal disputes. After Mr. Li finished speaking, others continued to speak, including some fierce remarks. Zhang Junmai saw that the situation was not good, and immediately urged that unity should be the priority, and stimulating words should not be said. However, this advice had little effect, the atmosphere in the meeting became worse, and the order was also poor. When the meeting was about to end, Wu Xianzi suggested that the matter be handed over to the presidium of the conference, but was rejected by the attending representatives, resulting in an unhappy ending. Zhang Jun persuaded afterwards: "I agree with the reconciliation plan agreed upon on the 27th, but today it was rejected by the conference. My position is very similar to that of Wilson after the First World War. I myself agree with the decision of the peace conference, but the treaty was rejected by the US Congress. Among the representatives attending the conference, 70% are newly elected representatives, and I cannot control their opinions. As for whether there will be another opportunity for reconciliation in the future, I dare not say now, but the relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and overseas is believed not to be broken. Wu Xianzi's mediation was all well-intentioned, but it was a pity that he lost his rigidity by saying "not attending" when he attended the meeting, which caused difficulties!"</p>
<p>[Another report] The National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party held meetings yesterday morning and afternoon to discuss the draft of the party's general charter. It was passed after three readings at 7 pm. The content is divided into eight chapters and forty-four articles, which are very detailed. The proposals will be reviewed all day today.</p>

<h3>Great Victory at Linqu Rivals Siping, All Communists Inside and Outside the City Have Been Eliminated, Over 40,000 Communists Annihilated, Pursuit Continuing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Qingdao, July 31] The great victory at Linqu took place at 5 pm on the 30th. Qingdao received this news late at night. Observers believe that this is the Siping Street battle in Shandong, and it has a decisive impact on the war situation in Shandong. When the north and south reinforcements attacked from Nigushan, Muhushan, and Shangshangshangxia Wujing from east and west, and cooperated from inside and outside, the bandits still struggled. The sky was clear and blue, the air force was active, and the artillery fire could also concentrate its firepower. The bandits finally collapsed, their formation was chaotic, and they fled. The defending troops in the city were struggling, and they had reached the point where ammunition and aid were exhausted. They relied entirely on aircraft for supply. It happened that there had been continuous dangerous rain for several days. Thanks to General Li Mi's calm command and the soldiers' hard work, the weather turned sunny on the 30th, and the reinforcements arrived, boosting morale greatly. They used the force of thunder to achieve the victory at Linqu in one fell swoop, and achieved brilliant results. Observers believe that the Communist army launched an offensive on July 7, attacking Taian, invading Feixian, and fleeing south to Taierzhuang, attempting to change its inner line to an outer line and disperse the national army's forces. The national army smashed its dangerous plan, automatically abandoned some strongholds, concentrated its forces, and seized the opportunity to capture its main force and defeat it, thus successively recovering the strongholds. In the battle of Linqu, the Communist bandits originally planned to take advantage of a gap, concentrate their forces, and attack the elite troops of the national army stationed between Linqu and Weicheng. However, the national army was able to fight ten against one, and finally achieved a great victory, thwarting their conspiracy.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, July 31] The national army in Linqu has won a decisive victory. The Li Mi troops in the city and the reinforcements continued to pursue the seven columns of Chen Yi who were defeated in three routes on the 31st. By the time the telegram was sent, the Communist bandits had suffered more than 40,000 casualties, more than 1,000 were captured alive, and a division of remnant bandits surrounded by the national army north of the city was mostly annihilated by the national army except for a part that broke through and fled north. All circles in Shandong decided to celebrate the great victory at Linqu within days and expand the comforting of the army.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Qingdao, July 31] After the total collapse of the bandits besieging Linqu, they fled north in three routes on the evening of the 30th. A part of them arrived at the Jiaoji Line late at night and fought fiercely with the security team led by Commissioner Zhang Tianzu west of Yaogou. Division Commander Li Mi personally led his troops to pursue the bandits fleeing to Yidu. There were no bandit traces inside and outside Linqu City.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, July 31] The remnants of the seven columns of the Communist bandits' East China Field Army who invaded Linqu fled in panic along the Jiaoji Road last night. The Communist bandits suffered more than 60,000 casualties in the past seven days. The 8th and 9th columns were almost completely destroyed. More than 20,000 Communist bandits from the 1st and 4th columns and the 13th Division of the 5th column who fled to the mountainous areas of southern Shandong have surrendered to the national army with weapons in the past two weeks. More than 7,000 of their remnants are currently being continuously surrounded and annihilated by the national army in Xiucheng, northwest of Tengxian County. Due to lack of ammunition and food, more and more people are surrendering. The national army in western Shandong recovered Yuncheng at 6 pm on the 30th. Fierce fighting is still going on in the Yangshanji area.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, July 31] The war in southwestern Shandong has become more intense again. After replenishment, five columns of Liu Bocheng's army, two of which recrossed into Yangshanji on the 27th, one column invaded Datianji, about 20 kilometers north of Chengwu, and one column and an independent brigade fled east from Dayiji to Guoliji on the 30th. The national army's powerful army groups are continuing to surround and annihilate them.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, July 31] Two columns of bandits who secretly cut the Jinpu Road from the boundary river and Guanqiao of Tengxian and Zouxian have been surrounded by the national army in Jinjiazhuang on the bank of Zhengshan Lake since the 29th. More than half of the first column has been annihilated by the national army. In addition, the remnants of the two columns who fled northeast from Tianshan Zhangwu (southwest of Wenshang) suddenly attacked Ningyang on the 31st. Fierce fighting has broken out again in the suburbs of Ningyang. The national armies from all routes are continuing to encircle and hunt them down.</p>
<h3>### Communist Bandits in Northeast Attempt to Move Again, Launching Rumor Offensive Claiming They Will Attack Siping Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The sixth offensive of the Communist bandits in Northeast China is about to begin, with tentative attacks. In the Huaide area of the northern route, the Communist bandits have gathered a part of their main force, intending to attack Gongzhuling. In the Lanping area of the southern route, the Communist bandits are preparing to attack Dashiqiao and Yingkou. In addition, the Communist bandits have recently launched a rumor offensive, claiming that they will attack Siping again in early August. However, judging from the strength of the Communist bandits, it is impossible. A few days ago, the Communist leaders held a military review meeting in Harbin, revealing that the Communist bandits suffered more than 120,000 casualties in the Siping battle. According to documents captured by the Siping military, it is proved that the Communist army suffered 90,000 casualties, which can confirm that the Communist bandits have lost more than half of their main force. However, the bandits are actively replenishing and training in the mountainous areas on the east and west wings of Siping. Their next action deserves attention. Chen Mingren, the commander of Siping, told reporters in a frank and firm tone yesterday: He very much welcomes the Communist bandits to attack Siping again. The military and civilians in Siping are deeply confident in the stability of Siping.</p>
<h3>### Anti-Communist Campaign in Western Hebei Temporarily Concluded</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Baoding, July 31] The anti-Communist campaign by the national army in western Hebei has temporarily come to an end. The troops under Nie Rongzhen, about 40,000, are currently fleeing from the Taihang Mountain area to Anguo, Dingxian, Xinle, Dongchangshou, and the east side of Pingbao Road in Xingtang, Pingshan, and Lingshou, and are advancing east along the Baocang Highway. The national army has successively withdrawn from Quyang, Tangxian and other places in western Hebei, transferred the battlefield, and surrounded and suppressed the main force of the Communist bandits. In addition, the national army in the Pingjinbao triangular area has launched an anti-Communist campaign, launching offensives from Rongcheng and Gu'an.</p>
<h3>### "Settling Old Scores" by Shanxi Bandits Creates Rural Terror</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th] The Communist bandits' "settling old scores struggle" is intensifying. They hold so-called "speaking bitterness conferences" everywhere. The method is to struggle after speaking, divide after struggling, whoever speaks gets divided, and then speak, struggle and divide again, creating rural terror. The Communist bandits are forcing the people to grow opium in Xixian, Daning, Yonghe and other counties, and then forcibly buying it at 60,000 yuan per tael in counterfeit currency, and sending it into the national army area in armed forces, attempting to realize the poisoning conspiracy.</p>
<h3>### Joint Transportation Between Changchun and Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Shenyang, July 31] The train between Changchun and Shenyang has been cut off for two and a half months.

<h3>### At the United Nations Membership Committee, Xu Shuxi Upheld Justice and Sternly Refuted the Fallacies of the Soviet Representative</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 310th] Chinese representative Xu Shuxi made a speech at the Security Council Committee today, refuting the statement made by the Soviet representative on the 28th accusing China of being responsible for the Beitashan incident, calling it "Outer Mongolia's occupation of lies." Mr. Xu's speech was the strongest ever made by a Chinese representative at the United Nations, in which he firmly refuted the Soviet representative's statement that the Beitashan area was within Outer Mongolia. Mr. Xu first explained today: He has not yet seen the excerpt of the statement made by Soviet representative Krasilnikov on the 28th, and will only answer it in general. Mr. Xu retorted the Soviet representative's accusation that China invaded Outer Mongolia in order to make the world pay attention to its new chapter, saying: "If the Soviet representative said that Outer Mongolia's ancient invasion of Xinjiang was aimed at assisting traitors in North China, so as to restrain the Chinese government and serve as a second front, then his understanding of the Far East political situation would be more thorough than before." Krasilnikov's remarks when replying to the Chinese representative today seemed milder than those on the 28th. He pointed out that the main point of the Chinese representative was that Beitashan was not within Outer Mongolia, but the Chinese representative failed to effectively refute the statement of the Foreign Minister of Outer Mongolia (which Mr. Ke cited). In addition to stating that the Soviet delegation did not recognize that Beitashan was within China, Mr. Ke also asked: "If this is true, why does China allow armed conflicts to occur within its borders?" Xu Shuxi replied: It is absurd to talk about whether a country can "allow" its teeth to be attacked by others. Krasilnikov not only reiterated today that the Beitashan incident was caused by certain people in China who wanted to shift the world's attention to China's internal situation, but also asked why the Xinjiang incident happened before sending the so-called fact-finding mission to China? Mr. Ke's words were obviously aimed at the Wedemeyer inspection team. He also said: "The statement that there were planes with Soviet red star markings is a shameless lie." Xu Shuxi pointed out that the committee has only heard the Soviet representative mention the participation of planes with Soviet markings in combat up to now. The Polish chairman of the committee suggested that the application of Outer Mongolia to join the United Nations be postponed for discussion so that other representatives could have time to study the statements of the Chinese and Soviet representatives. The motion to postpone the discussion was passed after the US representative stated that the postponement must be temporary.</p>
<h3>### US Undersecretary of State Talks About the Japanese Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett told a press conference today that the US and other ten representatives of the Far East Commission will discuss and decide on the date of the preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty again. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on August 19, but was postponed due to the conflict with the Imperial Conference held in Canberra, Australia on August 26. He did not mention the Washington news published in the New York Herald Tribune today. The news said: China opposed the US proposal, that is, the eleven countries of the Far East Commission have the right to vote when concluding the Japanese peace treaty, because this will make China unable to obtain the right to speak commensurate with the huge sacrifices it suffered in the war. The New York newspaper report may be based on the recent proposal put forward by the National Political Council in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The Central News Agency reporter learned from a reliable source tonight that the Chinese government's reply to the US invitation to attend the preliminary meeting of the eleven countries for the Japanese peace treaty was submitted to the State Department on July 24. According to the spokesman of the hospital, he said earlier this week and today that he had not received the Chinese reply, and the Nanjing reply has not been announced.</p>

<h3>After the Suspension of Relief Supplies to North China, UNRRA Proposes a New Plan, Huo Bao-Shu and Cleveland Arrive in Nanjing to Meet the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Huo Bao-Shu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and Cleveland, Director of UNRRA's China Office, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai together on the 31st and met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the afternoon to present the current state of relief and rehabilitation matters.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] UNRRA's headquarters in Washington announced yesterday that until a more satisfactory agreement is reached on the distribution of relief supplies in the Communist areas, the supply of relief materials to North China, including both government and Communist areas, will be temporarily suspended. This order is effective from July 28th. All materials scheduled for delivery to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude, including North China and Jehol, whether destined for government or Communist areas, will be held in custody by UNRRA's China Office. UNRRA's action follows the formal statement by the Chinese government that it cannot protect the distribution of supplies in the war zones. UNRRA believes that this violates the principle of fair distribution of relief supplies and has brought it to the attention of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee. After investigation, the Far East Regional Committee submitted a recommendation for suspension to the UNRRA Central Committee. After consideration, the Central Committee immediately ordered a temporary suspension and, at the same time, proposed a new plan to Chairman Chiang, under which 50,000 tons of the originally agreed 83,000 tons of materials that had not yet been shipped would be transported to Communist-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Content of the New Plan</p>
<p>The content of the new plan is as follows: (1) Designate fixed three-week periods in August, September, and October, and consider Yantai as a "safe harbor" under wartime regulations, so that UNRRA's free ships can transport UNRRA relief and rehabilitation supplies into Yantai. Another part of this proposal is that the Communist authorities should provide assurances that when UNRRA ships are anchored in Yantai, the port will not be used for any military activities, including the supply of materials. (2) Transport 25,000 tons of supplies from Tianjin along the Grand Canal into Communist-controlled areas for a period of two weeks, in a "blitz" transportation operation, first in September, then in September and October. During this period, the area from Tianjin along the Grand Canal south to Botou (in Hebei Province, approximately 75 miles southwest of Tianjin) should be demilitarized. In addition, the continuation of the Yellow River project is also under negotiation.</p>
<p>If the above new plan is agreed to by the Chinese government, UNRRA's China Office will be ordered to obtain the necessary guarantees from the Communist side. The UNRRA Central Committee has set a deadline of the 15th to obtain the agreement of both the government and Communist leaders to this new plan. If the plan cannot be implemented by then, the Central Committee will re-evaluate UNRRA's China relief plan.</p>
<h3>Editorial: UNRRA Suspends Supply of Materials to North China</h3>
<p>UNRRA headquarters announced yesterday that it has suspended the transport of relief supplies to both the Communist-controlled areas and government-administered areas of North China, effective from the 28th of this month. UNRRA's China Office explained that this was because the Chinese government recently declared that it could no longer protect the distribution of relief supplies in the war zones. Thus, the transport of relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas by UNRRA goes against the principle of equal distribution of relief supplies. Therefore, the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee was asked to pay attention to this matter. After consideration, the committee proposed the suspension of transport to North China to UNRRA headquarters. The UNRRA Central Executive Committee then instructed the China Office to comply, and proposed two measures for the Chinese government to accept. We have many feelings regarding UNRRA's decision. Now, we will state one or two points for the reference of people both inside and outside the country:</p>
<p>First, UNRRA was created during the difficult times of the Great War. At that time, everyone foresaw the economic difficulties of the people of the war-torn countries. To prepare in advance, this international relief organization was established in the United States before the end of the war. Since the victory of the war, UNRRA has begun relief work in Europe and Asia, and has now been doing so for more than a year and a half. European and Asian countries, especially those devastated by the war, have indeed benefited greatly. However, in China, which is in dire need of relief, UNRRA's work seems to be far less successful than in other countries. We believe that the reason for this is due to the following two factors: one is that UNRRA personnel have an unclear understanding of the political situation in China and often cannot cooperate harmoniously with the Chinese government on the issue of relief to the Communist-controlled areas; the other is the problem of UNRRA personnel themselves. Although ordinary Chinese people often see news in the newspapers about relief supplies coming to China in a steady stream, how much benefit have they actually received?</p>
<p>Second, UNRRA insists that relief supplies transported to China should be distributed fairly, regardless of whether they are government-administered areas or Communist-controlled areas. In principle, we can certainly agree with this, because the people in the Communist-controlled areas are also our pitiful and innocent compatriots and should receive UNRRA's relief. However, the question is not whether it should or should not be done, but whether the people there can truly receive the materials after UNRRA transports them to the Communist-controlled areas? Will they fall into the hands of the Communists and become provisions for bandits? UNRRA personnel certainly cannot understand this issue. We may as well tell them about the actual situation in the Communist-controlled areas. Not to mention that UNRRA's supplies will not be distributed to the people, even the daily necessities of the people themselves cannot be retained for their own use. Therefore, UNRRA's transport of relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas is nominally providing relief to the people there, but in reality, it is no different from aiding the Communists and cultivating their strength to create chaos and harm the country. Since the government has issued a clear order to suppress the rebellion and mobilize national manpower and resources to suppress the Communists and build the country, the matter of UNRRA providing aid to the Communists cannot be allowed to continue!</p>
<p>Third, UNRRA is using "suspension of transport" as a means to coerce the Chinese government into accepting its proposed measures, and this approach is even less tolerable to us. Here, we cannot help but ask our government: How many supplies has UNRRA transported to China in total? Would the Chinese people completely die without UNRRA's relief? Have the people of China suffered great famines in history without foreign relief, and then become extinct? The Chinese nation is a great and unyielding nation. Rather than wagging our tails and begging for "charity," it is better to clench our teeth, endure hunger and cold, and seek a way to self-reliance. Therefore, we want to suggest that the government resolutely reject UNRRA's proposals, with absolutely no room for consideration. If UNRRA insists on its own way, then we would rather let UNRRA's work in China end sooner.</p>
<p>Fourth, UNRRA's nature is different from ordinary charitable organizations. It has the task of stabilizing the social economy of various countries in the post-war world. It should pay special attention to the internal and actual situation of each country affected by the war. UNRRA personnel should have a long-term perspective when allocating relief supplies. They must not base their decisions on personal prejudices, otherwise the country being aided will not only fail to benefit from it, but also run the risk of further disrupting the country's social economy.</p>

<h3>The Dike of Northern Jiangsu Breaks, Mu, Pi, and Other Counties Report Disaster, Land Travel by Boat, Hope for Autumn Harvest Lost</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st] Continuous windstorms and rain have caused the waters of the Yi, Shu, and Canal Rivers to surge, and the dikes of the Central Canal have collapsed in many places. The water is raging, and the counties of Shuyang, Pi, Suqian, and Donghai are a vast expanse of water. Land travel is by boat, and hope for the autumn harvest is lost. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has received repeated telegrams from the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau and various counties reporting the disaster situation. It is taking the situation very seriously. In addition to constantly instructing the counties to work together to rescue, the need for funds and materials is urgent. A special urgent telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Water Conservancy to promptly approve and allocate the province's flood prevention funds for application to avoid the expansion of the disaster.</p>

<h3>The Flow of Jing River in Shaanxi Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>Heavy Rain in Northern Shaanxi at the Beginning of the Week Seen Only Once in 20 Years</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 31st] A Central News Agency telegram yesterday stated that the flow of the Jing River had broken all previous records, which is greatly different from the report of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau.

Currently, there is not much accumulated water in the section of the Yellow River east of Mengjin.

In addition, there was also heavy rain in northern Shaanxi at the beginning of the week, which has been seen only once in 20 years. Many bridges in the area were washed away, and traffic has not yet resumed.</p>
<h3>External Transportation of Fuzhou Falls Into a State of Isolation</h3>
<p>Sea, Air, and Land Routes Are All Blocked</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 31st] Recently, external transportation in Fuzhou has become isolated due to the reduction in the number of ships and aircraft. The Fuzhou-Shanghai route currently has no scheduled passenger transport. The Fuzhou-Taiwan route only has one small boat going back and forth, and the schedule is uncertain. Each flight is extremely crowded. As for routes to Tianjin and other ports, there are no scheduled ships, relying solely on a small number of freighters to take passengers. Although China National Aviation Corporation has a station in Fuzhou, it has not landed in Fuzhou recently for some reason. Only one flight from Shanghai to Nanchang and Hankou via Fuzhou lands once a week, with limited seats and difficulty in purchasing tickets. The Fuzhou-Xiamen highway is still under construction, and most of the highways in northwestern Fujian are damaged and impassable. Therefore, traveling from Fuzhou to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other places requires trekking through barren mountain roads. Under these circumstances where sea, air, and land transportation are all blocked, Fuzhou has become an isolated place, cut off from the outside world.</p>

<h3>Nanjing High Court Re-Sentences: Yin Rugeng Still Sentenced to Death, the Old Traitor's Expression Changed Greatly During Sentencing, He Was Flustered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The old traitor Yin Rugeng was sentenced to death again by the Capital High Court on the 30th. At 10 a.m., Presiding Judge Chuan Qinqing and others opened the court in the Grand Achievement Hall and brought the traitor to the court. After clarifying his identity, the judgment was read out: "Yin Rugeng colluded continuously with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country. He is sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life, and all property will be confiscated, except for a reasonable amount of living expenses reserved for family members." Yin's expression changed greatly upon hearing the verdict, and he was at a loss. President Zhao Chen told our reporter that Yin's case is a valuable legal case. The court's previous trial divided Yin's actions into the crime of internal disorder under the ordinary criminal law and the crime of traitor under the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and the Punishment of Traitors Regulations. Now, it is based on the consistency of his crimes and sentenced according to the crime of traitor.

His crimes are extremely heinous. The court, legally speaking, believes that Yin has no reason not to die. He finally stated that the judgment of this retrial will still be sent to the Supreme Court for review.</p>
<h3>India and Australia Request Arbitration of the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute: The Security Council Begins Discussion; Britain and the United States Still Plan to Mediate Informally</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 31st. The Security Council began discussing the proposal by India and Australia at 3:00 PM today to prevent the Dutch-Indonesian war. Originally, the Security Council was to discuss the Balkan issue, but it has now decided to give priority to the Dutch-Indonesian issue. According to well-informed sources, the Netherlands is making every effort to prevent the United Nations from intervening in the Dutch-Indonesian war. Therefore, the Security Council is taking the lead in mediation, giving priority to the Dutch-Indonesian issue and temporarily suspending the debate on the Balkan issue. It is reported that the Security Council's discussion of the Dutch-Indonesian issue will be short-lived, and if no resolution is reached, it will be shelved and the Balkan issue will be addressed again. The Security Council's swift action to give priority to the Dutch-Indonesian issue has reportedly doomed the Netherlands' attempt to prevent the United Nations from intervening in the Dutch-Indonesian war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 31st] Official sources stated today that the Chinese government will support Australia's submission of the Indonesian issue to the United Nations. China's primary concern is to quickly stop the Indonesian war to avoid endangering the lives and property of overseas Chinese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet formally decided on instructing the Chinese representative to the United Nations Security Council to support Australia's actions, but the Chinese government is prepared to support any concrete steps that can stop the Indonesian war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] U.S. Under Secretary of State Lovett publicly confirmed here on the 30th for the first time that the U.S. government has discussed the Indonesian issue with Britain and other countries in the past ten days. Officials here believe that the Security Council is almost unanimously of the opinion that peaceful resolution steps must be taken quickly, but the positions of the various countries differ. India advocates that the United Nations immediately condemn the Netherlands' mistakes, while Australia argues that the United Nations should intervene based on the grounds that "the Indonesian issue is sufficient to endanger world peace."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Judging from Foreign Secretary Bevin's answers to questions from members of the House of Commons, the British government still seems to favor mediation rather than appealing to United Nations institutions to end the Indonesian dispute. Bevin also revealed that the British government is continuing to exchange views with the United States, so some have speculated that Britain and the United States may take joint action to try to get the Dutch government to end the Indonesian conflict.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons that the British government has already prohibited the Netherlands from transporting war materials to the Dutch East Indies via Singapore and other British territories in the Far East. As for Britain training and equipping Dutch troops, this is a sacred promise that Britain made to the Netherlands when Germany occupied the Netherlands. I can only declare to the Dutch government that we are training and equipping Dutch troops for purposes other than fighting in Indonesia.</p>

Kleffens went on to deny that the Netherlands was carrying out a "colonial war" in Indonesia, or that it would ask Britain to mediate. He also said that for the past two years, the Dutch representatives attending the Security Council have repeatedly argued that the United Nations Charter only applies to relations between independent countries, and that Indonesia is not an independent country and, in fact, has no government to speak of. At this point, a reporter interrupted him and asked why, if the Dutch government did not recognize it as a republic, it had spent months negotiating with it and had signed agreements with it, treating it as part of the Dutch Imperial Federation? Kleffens refused to answer this directly, only saying that the Netherlands had only hoped that it would be a cooperative representative.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Amsterdam, 30th] The Dutch cabinet has discussed the matter of India and Australia submitting the Indonesian war to the United Nations for appeal. No official comment has been issued. Unofficial sources say the matter is "deplorable."</p>

<h3>British Government Firmly Advocates Nationalization of German Coal Mines, Has Not Yet Accepted U.S. Compromise Solution</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Regarding the nationalization of the Ruhr coal mines, a conflict is likely to occur when representatives of Britain and the United States begin to study the issue of increasing production next week. British Foreign Secretary Bevin not only wants to socialize German coal mines, but also other major German industries. However, after U.S. Secretary of State Marshall explored the opinions of members of Congress for several months, he learned that this plan would be difficult to obtain funding from Congress. Most members of Congress in the United States believe that this is a measure to form communism. The United States has offered a compromise solution to the nationalization proposal and the British proposal for "immediate action," proposing a five-year extension and waiting for the German people to resolve it themselves. However, Britain has not yet accepted this U.S. compromise proposal and insists that nationalization will be implemented immediately in the British occupation zone. Therefore, this matter will become a subject of fierce debate when Britain and the United States convene a German coal production conference here next week.</p>

It has not yet been decided whether France's opinion will be presented at the Three-Power Conference or through normal diplomatic channels.

<h3>The Soviet Union Opposes Ireland, Portugal, and Other Countries Joining the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 30th] When a committee of the United Nations discussed the applications of Ireland, Portugal, and Jordan to join the organization today, the Soviet Union worked to prevent their admission to the United Nations. The reasons given by Soviet representative Krasinikov were that Ireland had publicly expressed sympathy for the Axis powers and Franco's Spain during the most critical period of the war. Portugal not only did not aid the Allied countries, but actually aided the enemies of the Allied countries. As for Jordan, the Soviet Union still expressed great doubt about the independence of Jordan.</p>
<h3>Britain's Serious Economic Situation: Socialist Experiments Face Tests</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th] After two years of Labour Party rule, Britain is still mired in poverty. Slogans are posted on street corners warning the people of the country: "No work, no food." Ten years of depression, six years of war, plus two years of socialist experiments, Britain lacks electricity, cradles, knives, forks, plates, tractors, cars, textiles, steel, etc. The number of items is countless, almost involving every aspect of life. However, the five-year plan to nationalize basic industries is being strictly implemented without any compromise in accordance with the party program.</p>
<p>In the first year, Congress passed laws on nationalized coal mines, airlines, the Bank of England, and wired and wireless news agencies. In the second year, other laws were passed to nationalize transportation businesses such as railways, buses, and trucks, as well as electricity production. In addition, central and local officials were given the power to manage real estate, guarantee satisfactory crop prices and markets, and force farmers to work hard to cultivate the land, otherwise they would be deprived of their land.</p>
<p>However, the people are still poorly dressed, live in cold houses, and have meager rations. They complain about the government's strict measures. Bread is still rationed, and only limited quantities of ham, fresh meat, and butter are distributed each week. Although the clothing rationing system has been slightly relaxed, the number of vouchers has not increased much, and they are all spent on buying sheets. The housewives' league is quite indignant about this, but the government says that according to statistics, the food distribution situation is better than before the war. Crises are lurking in the future and are expected to follow one after another. Coal is a major resource in Britain, but there is a risk of a shortage again this winter, even if the situation is not as serious as last winter. The government has issued a warning that a shortage of electricity this winter may cause panic again.</p>
<p>According to Commerce Minister Cripps, exports have fallen sharply, with losses of about 200 million pounds, or 800 million U.S. dollars. Of the 3.75 billion U.S. dollars borrowed from the United States, half has been used up in less than a year, most of it spent on food. If it is all used up, unless loans continue to be taken out, otherwise they will starve. Steel production is gradually increasing, but it is only enough to supply 80% of the country's reconstruction and export needs. The nationalization of steel will be discussed at the next parliament meeting this fall.</p>
<p>Last winter's heavy snow and floods destroyed about 25% of the country's cattle and sheep, and destroyed thousands of acres of wheat fields, resulting in a one-month delay in the harvest of vegetables and other crops. The government promised farmers more benefits to increase grain production this season, and began to abolish subsidies for certain types of food, and invested funds, which led to soaring prices. The next general election was originally scheduled for 1950, but there are rumors that it will be held earlier due to the urgency of the crisis.</p>
<p>The Conservative Party has formulated an industrial plan that emphasizes private enterprise, but also recognizes the achievements of socialization, such as the nationalization of coal mines. The Ministry of Finance is very troubled by financial issues. Experts are trying to reduce British pound debt, but have not succeeded. Trade talks with Moscow, in which Britain hoped to exchange machinery for Soviet wheat and timber, have broken down. The left wing of the Labour Party is dissatisfied with the status quo and has "rebelled" twice. Prime Minister Attlee attended a secret meeting at the request of Labour Party members today to report on the policy of dealing with the economic crisis, and it is reported that he has obtained approval.</p>
<h3>Royal Arrives in Germany</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal arrived here today to confer with U.S. military government governor Clay and other committee members. Official sources said that Royal's visit was to consult with military government officials in view of the importance of the German occupation mission.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Sends a Note to Britain Proposing to Postpone the Ratification of the Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] A spokesman for the Foreign Office said that the Soviet government has sent a note to the British government expressing the hope that the ratification of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland will be postponed until the former enemy countries themselves ratify their treaties. At the same time, it stated that the Soviet Union, in principle, is not opposed to the ratification of the peace treaties with the five former enemy countries. Authoritative sources expect that the British government will not accept this attitude of the Soviet Union. The reason given is that it cannot be established for enemy countries that have already ratified the treaty themselves, such as Finland. This move by the Soviet Union will not only delay the entry into force of the treaty, but also prevent the meeting to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonies from being held. The Soviet Union has previously stated that it is unwilling to discuss the issue of Italian colonies before the peace treaty with Italy comes into effect.</p>
<h3>Two British Soldiers Kidnapped in Greece, Still Missing</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 30th] According to official sources, the fate of the two British soldiers kidnapped by bandits is still unknown. They were kidnapped on the North Makos highway along with a truck, and were first detained in the village of Kadichai. Some rumors say that the British soldiers have been released, but official sources say that they have not yet reported to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Greek Government Offers Reward for the Arrest of Guerrilla Leaders</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 30th] The Greek government recently announced that anyone who can arrest guerrilla leader Vafiadis can receive a reward of 20 million drachmas (equivalent to 4,000 U.S. dollars). Anyone who can report his hiding place can get 15 million drachmas.</p>
<h3>British Sergeant Killed</h3>
<p>British Members of Parliament Condemn Jewish Atrocities</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] Members of the House of Commons unanimously condemned the Irgun party's killing of the two British sergeants.

When the body was taken down from the tree, the bomb exploded, injuring another British sergeant.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Provides Assistance to Yugoslavia to Realize Industrialization Plans</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] Today, the local newspapers reported that the statement on the business agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on the 25th stated that since the two countries agreed on the direction of economic cooperation on June 10, 1946, development has become increasingly close, so it was decided to conclude this agreement for the exchange of goods, stipulating that the Soviet Union will transport industrial equipment to Yugoslavia in 1948 to help it build various factories. Starting in 1950, Yugoslavia will begin to fulfill its obligations to the Soviet Union, transporting products to the Soviet Union or paying for Soviet machinery in currency. The newspapers continued to comment that the Soviet Union is now providing such effective assistance to Yugoslavia, and its purpose is to enable the country to realize its industrialization plan and its economic development.</p>
<h3>Dissatisfied with Soviet Representatives' Abuse of the Veto, the U.S. Will Take Retaliatory Action; Greece Will File New Complaints on the Balkan Issue</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 31st: The Soviet Union has vetoed the U.S. proposal on the Balkan situation. In response to the Soviet Union's exercise of its veto power, Britain and the United States have decided to take retaliatory measures. Encouraged by Britain and the United States, Greece has decided to invoke Section 7 of the United Nations Charter to accuse its neighboring countries of aggression to the Security Council again. Greece's new accusations will prevent the Balkan issue from being affected by the Soviet veto and keep it on the Security Council's agenda.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 31st] Well-informed sources here said today that after the Soviet Union exercised its veto power in the United Nations Security Council on the U.S. proposal to establish a Balkan border monitoring group, the United States may take decisive action to seek revenge. U.S. Representative Johnson was summoned back to Washington by Secretary of State Marshall yesterday to assist in drafting countermeasures. He returned here this morning, presumably carrying a concrete plan, which will announce the next step of the United States at this afternoon or evening's meeting. Although the content of the countermeasures decided by the State Department and Johnson is not yet known, it does not go beyond the following three routes:</p>
<p>(1) Based on the provisions of the United Nations Charter on punitive measures, condemn Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for directly threatening world peace, and request the Security Council to discuss it. (2) According to the United Nations emergency provisions, urge the five major powers of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the measures that can be implemented. (3) Submit the entire Balkan issue to the United Nations General Assembly, so that a border monitoring group can be established without the use of veto power, but if the Balkan countries do not agree, this kind of monitoring group still cannot perform its duties within the borders of each country. Official sources admit that one of the above three routes will have serious consequences for the United Nations, but on the other hand, after the Soviet Union exercised its veto power, the situation was already extremely serious, tantamount to openly challenging the United Nations' power to maintain world peace.</p>
<h3>The British King Announces the Marriage of the Eldest Princess to the Privy Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 31st] The Privy Council met at noon today, and King George formally announced that he had approved the marriage of the eldest princess, Elizabeth, to Captain Mountbatten. This procedure is stipulated by the Royal Marriage Act of 175 years ago.</p>

Peng and his team have been very discreet in their activities since arriving in Shanghai. In addition to meeting with Commander Xuan Tiewu, they also visited Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan yesterday morning to exchange opinions.

According to sources, Mr. Qin will likely not come to Shanghai, and a senior military judge will preside over the military trial here.</p>
<p>The tripartite investigation committee has obtained clues about the truth of the case after four days of investigation. The investigation report was completed yesterday and submitted to Commander Xuan for review.

The final decision will be made by the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<h3>Jindu's Losses Ascertained: Estimated at Approximately 200 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jindu Theater was vandalized, and all its assets suffered heavy losses.

<h3>Vandalism of Jindu Requires Private Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the bloody incident involving military police conflict outside the Jindu Theater, because the military police are active-duty soldiers, the District Prosecutor's Office has no authority to conduct an investigation and should handle it in accordance with the Law of Military Trials for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. As for the police vandalizing the Jindu Theater, it constitutes a crime of property damage under the Criminal Law. However, the crime of property damage requires private prosecution. The District Prosecutor's Office has no opinion on this before the parties express their intentions.</p>
<h3>Garrison Command and Police Continue to Summon Witnesses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Shigao, Section Chief of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command, together with the responsible persons of the police and military police, yesterday continued to summon relevant persons at the Sixth Investigation Brigade to record their statements as evidence for the joint military trial.

Liu, dissatisfied, appealed to the Supreme Court for review, which ordered a retrial. Liu is from Minhou, Fujian, and has been working in the customs service for many years. He is 65 years old and his hair is all white. When he appeared in court yesterday, he was wearing a light blue silk long gown and old black leather shoes. Judge Chen Zhensheng immediately informed him: "The reason for this retrial is to investigate the defendant's favorable evidence in detail. You may state your case to the fullest." Liu stated: "I took up the puppet position at the invitation of Chen Jintao, the puppet Minister of Finance. During my time in the puppet position, there are two things worth mentioning: (1) I tried to rescue the underground worker Lin Tianguan. Lin was an education worker from the rear who came to Shanghai to investigate the education situation under the enemy and the puppets. He was arrested by the enemy's military police. I sent someone with my business card to plead with the enemy's military police, and he was released on bail after being detained for several days. (2) I provided assistance to the family of Feng Anbang. Feng was a division commander under Sun Lianzhong and died in the Battle of Taierzhuang. I provided living expenses for his family in Peiping." The court stated that the defendant's statement still required the summoning of witnesses and ordered a postponement of the trial.</p>

<h3>Sudden Decrease in Water Supply in Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's Supply Area; Company Discovers Leak in Main Pipe; Repairs Expected to Take Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Recently, the water supply in the area supplied by Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas of this city has suddenly decreased. Often, there is no water on the upper floors, and the water flow on the lower floors is also weak. To understand the reason, our reporter visited the person in charge of the company. According to the discussion: "At 1:30 PM on the 29th of this month, the water pressure in the company's water plant suddenly dropped by 15 pounds, resulting in a sudden decrease in the water supply in the supply area. Employees were dispatched to inspect the distribution of major water pipes. At the intersection of Wenshui Road and Yinhang Road, it was discovered that there was a severe leak in the 36-inch diameter cast iron main pipe. Technicians were immediately summoned for emergency treatment. However, due to the difficulty of the project, it may take about two weeks to repair. The damage to this 36-inch main pipe was due to the fact that during the period when the area was occupied, the Japanese moved the main pipe to the west side to expand the road, resulting in it being very close to the aircraft field's protective wall river. The location of the accident was at the bend of the river. The rapid flow of water in the river caused the bottom of the main pipe to become hollow and sink, and several iron pipe joints became detached and leaked. It is necessary to build dams at both ends of the river to cut off the water and drain it before construction can begin. During the repair period, another main pipe will be used to divert water, but the water supply will inevitably be slightly reduced. We hope that users will conserve water."</p>
<h3>Wartime Deposit Dispute: Appeal Court Orders Thousandfold Compensation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court yesterday ruled on a case involving a wartime deposit dispute, ordering the bank to pay compensation at a rate of one thousand times the original deposit. Wang Zhenxing had deposited 5,000 legal tender yuan in the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank for a total of five years, from 1940 to 1945. After the victory, due to the devaluation of the currency, he filed a lawsuit in court, requesting compensation at an increased rate. The District Court initially ruled that the Shanghai Bank should pay compensation at a rate of three hundred times. Wang, dissatisfied, appealed to the High Court. After careful investigation, the High Court ruled that the defendant, Shanghai Bank, should pay compensation at a rate of one thousand times, and that if the plaintiff, Wang Zhenxing, provided a guarantee of 3 million yuan, the judgment would be executed immediately.</p>
<h3>Courts Continue to Accept Deposit Dispute Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Disputes over requests from depositors for increased payments on wartime fixed deposits are piling up. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Justice issued an order approving the banking sector's request to no longer accept litigation cases involving increased payments on deposits, but the courts have stated that this is not accurate. The Shanghai Banking Association had previously requested the Ministry of Justice to exempt from preliminary enforcement the court's requirements that banks often grant demands from depositors, as such enforcement often interfered with banking business. The Ministry of Justice has responded to the Banking Association stating that such a demand has no legal basis and thus would be difficult to approve, and added that providing appropriate collateral would allow for exception from preliminary enforcement. The relevant official must weigh the situation and handle as appropriate. The outside world, not understanding the truth, has spread rumors that the courts would no longer be accepting such cases, but this is not true. The courts are still accepting deposit dispute cases as usual.</p>

<h3>Hai Xin Ship Changes Route to the Yangtze River; Shanghai-Ningbo Route Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiang Yun" and "Hai Xin" ships operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route and have been doing well.

<h3>Second Batch of Japanese Reparation Ships Received Yesterday; Navy Headquarters Appoints Captains for Each Ship</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The handover ceremony for the second batch of eight Japanese reparation warships was held at 9:00 AM yesterday on the "Jie Jiu (Receiving 9)" ship on the Longhua River. The ceremony was presided over by Fang Ying, Commander of the Navy's First Base Command. Yang Daozhao, Director of the Ship Receiving Department of the Navy Headquarters, Yao Yu, a Navy Colonel who escorted the fleet back to China, Heller, a representative of the Allied Headquarters, Zhang Xijie, Deputy Commander of the Port Command, and more than 100 officers and soldiers of the Chinese Navy participated. At the beginning of the receiving ceremony, the Chinese national flag was raised in the wind amid military music. Commander Fang then signed the receiving documents and handed them over to the representative of the Allied Headquarters. The simple ceremony was captured by photographers.</p>
<p>Simple Equipment</p>

<h3>The Complicated and Entangled Half-Year-Long Issue of the Beiyang Ping Department's Affiliation</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Beiping, Song Shaobo</p>
<p>The complicated issue of the Beiyang Ping Department's affiliation has now been resolved by the Ministry of Education, which ordered Peking University to take over. This half-year-long entanglement seems to have come to an end. However, the faculty and staff of the Beiyang Ping Department, less than half of the students, and the alumni association of the Ping University of Technology are still firmly opposed. Therefore, whether Peking University can smoothly take over on August 1st remains to be seen, depending on the development of the opposition. Due to the complexity of this matter, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education specially sent Deputy Minister Tian Peilin to Ping a week ago to make a decision with a quick and decisive approach. Hu Shi and Jin Wenshu, the acting president of Beiyang, are still racking their brains.</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Beiyang Ping Department was the Faculty of Engineering of Peking University. Not a few of its graduates are influential figures in today's society. During the enemy and puppet period, Ping Engineering was changed to the Faculty of Engineering of the puppet Peking University. After the victory, it went through a transitional period of the Provisional University. As the various schools successively resumed operations, the question of its affiliation became an issue. The Ping Engineering Alumni Association strived unsuccessfully to restore the independent Ping Engineering Institute. Joint management by Peking University and Tsinghua University was also unsuccessful, and Peking University's initial takeover was also unsuccessful. As a result, the Ministry of Education assigned it to Beiyang in Tianjin, making it its Ping Department. This was the genesis of the later multi-faceted dispute. (The Beiyang authorities could no longer continue to run it because they were too far away.) This involves the Ministry of Education, the highest authorities of Beiyang, all faculty and staff of the Beiyang Ping Department, two factions of students (mainly the Autonomous Association and the School Protection Association), the Ping University of Technology Alumni Association, and Peking University – seven parties in total. Analyzed, there are three different opinions: (1) maintain the status quo, (2) become independent, (3) be taken over by Peking University.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's measures for the Beiyang Ping Department have been criticized for lacking an overall plan and causing many disputes. Whether the Ministry of Education initially had prejudices against it is unknown to outsiders, but its repeated changes of course have certainly demonstrated indecision. After deciding to change the Beiyang Ping Department, it issued a clear order in February to prepare to move to Tianjin. In May, the students went on strike in opposition, and the entire school entered a state of anarchy. Most recently, it announced the takeover by Peking University.</p>
<p>Although the Ping Engineering Alumni Association has repeatedly issued declarations and submitted appeals, it has not attracted the attention of the Ministry of Education. After the entire body of more than 800 students of the Beiyang Ping Department went through the process of opposing the move to Tianjin, they split into two different factions. One faction, centered on the Student Autonomous Association, accounting for about half of the students, after the strike against the move to Tianjin proved effective, mainly worked to demand the takeover by Peking University. At this time, some people said: "The Beiyang Ping Department is like a beautiful young woman without a master, possessing a rich dowry, who frequently sends love glances to Peking University, taking it as her target." This faction of students had no other ill intentions, but simply admired the reputation of Peking University.</p>
<p>The other faction of students, following the wishes of all the faculty and staff, formed the School Protection Association and advocated maintaining the status quo. Although there were many actions in between, they ultimately failed. On July 28, the Professors' Association published three objections from this faction. They believed that firstly, President Jin, acting on behalf of the Ministry of Education, agreed to the takeover by Peking University without considering the opinions of all parties in the Ping Department. Secondly, after Deputy Minister Tian Peilin came to Ping, he acted secretly, avoiding meeting with anyone from the Ping Department. Even when Chen Jinmin inquired twice by telephone, he replied that he would not come, and only consulted with Peking University, which was not open and fair. Thirdly, Hu Shi also did not consider the opinions of various parties, forcing the merger of two engineering colleges with different academic systems. The Ping Engineering Alumni Association also expressed its attitude, believing that the Ministry of Education did not directly order Beiyang to hand over the Ping Department, but ordered Peking University to take over, because it was under pressure from a certain party. In their remarks, this faction seemed to be too激进, even calling Hu Shi and others "academic warlords," so the meaning of the "certain party" they referred to can be imagined. They also plan to publish an "Open Letter to Students of the World" to express their views specifically. Furthermore, there are rumors that they will expose the inside story of the "academic warlords" when Wedemeyer comes to Ping, which is both laughable and exasperating.</p>
<p>What will Peking University ultimately do? Reject it? Accept it?</p>
<p>On the surface, Hu Shi had repeatedly stated in the past that although the relevant parties hoped that Peking University would take over, he had never considered it. The reason was expressed in his letter to Jin Wenshu, the president of Beiyang, and Chen Jinmin, the director of the Ping Department, on July 25, after the matter was decided. That letter was published to show that he had no intention of turning against the northern part of Beiyang. He said: "I telegraphed Minister Zhu on the 30th (June) stating that it would be best if the Beiyang authorities still resolved this matter, increasing their funding so that they could be responsible for reform and development. The Faculty of Engineering of Peking University has limited manpower and does not want to add to the difficulties… Today, Peking University received an order from the Ministry of Education, and I hope to schedule a meeting…"</p>
<p>What is the reality? Someone described Peking University as follows: "With such a young woman with a rich dowry sending love glances, and with the orders of her parents (the Ministry of Education) and the words of a matchmaker (President Jin of Beiyang), even if the Peking University authorities cannot act like Sima Xiangru picking up with his zither, they cannot remain undisturbed like Liu Xiahui." But why did Hu Shi repeatedly state to reporters that he had not considered it? In fact, Hu had initially seen that the group of faculty and staff who relied on her (the Beiyang Ping Department) for a living were already watching to see if Peking University would take away their rice bowls.</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Education's clear order for Peking University to take over has arrived, Jin Wenshu and Chen Yimin had already gone to Beijing, lacking responsible persons, and the students of the Beiyang Ping Department's School Protection Association responded to the attitude of the faculty and staff, expressing their refusal to accept the takeover. Therefore, whether Peking University can smoothly get started is still uncertain. (Sent from Beiping on July 28)</p>
<h3>Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament: Huayan Wins in Both Men's and Women's Divisions; Yongsha Straight Sets Victory Over Guber</h3>

<h3>Four-Bank Joint Council Decides: National Cotton Arrival Bills Must Be Redeemed; Cannot Be Converted into Pledge Loans; Manufacturers Entrusted by the Ministry of Food to Produce Flour Will Not Receive Additional Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] The 349th council meeting of the Four-Bank Joint Administration was held on the morning of the 31st, with Council Member Chen Guofu acting as chairman. Council members Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Xu Kan, Weng Wen, Huo, Chen Qitian, Yu Dawei (represented by Tan Boyu), Zhao Dihua (represented by Tang Ju), Li Shuming, and Secretary-General Xu Batu, Director Wu Rencang, Director Gu Chunfan, and General Manager Shou Miancheng, among others, were present, reviewing and approving more than 100 loan proposals and discussing two major cases:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding loan cases for flour mills in various regions, the Administration has been verifying and issuing loans based on the actual production capacity of each factory. Recently, the Ministry of Food entrusted five major flour mills in Shanghai, including Fufeng and Fuxin, to handle the purchase of wheat and flour production business. In order to understand the details of this case, the Administration specially invited representatives from the Ministry of Food to attend and explain, so as to serve as a reference for future review of loan applications from flour mills in various regions. It was decided at today's meeting that factories that have already accepted the Ministry of Food's commission to produce flour should not receive additional assistance from the banks. As for other factories, they should be assisted separately in the form of orders. Before the ordering method is approved, loans can be approved according to customary practices.</p>
<p>(2) The cotton bill of exchange principle established by the Administration in September of last year expired at the end of May this year. After the 345th council meeting, it was decided not to renew it. From June 1st, the bill of exchange method for daily necessities was adopted. At today's meeting, supplementary regulations were made, stipulating that from now on, cotton bills of exchange undertaken by various banks should be limited to domestic cotton transported from the production area to the sales area. In addition, arrival bills of exchange must be redeemed and absolutely cannot be converted into pledge loans.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Purchases Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Applications Reach More Than 30,000 Bales</p>
<p>As of today, the China Trust Bureau has received applications for the purchase of more than 30,000 bales of foreign cotton, including more than ten factories such as Shenxin. Shenxin accounts for the largest amount, about 40%. The Bureau will send personnel to customs warehouses to inspect and accept the goods, and will still entrust them to the factories for spinning. The method of spinning is being exchanged with the Six-District Association. The Association has expressed acceptance of the principle of spinning, and the detailed method is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the application deadline for purchasing foreign cotton arriving at the port was originally the end of July. After the first small group meeting of the China Trust Bureau, it was decided to extend the deadline to August 15th. According to reporters, most of the cotton importers this time are foreign firms, while Chinese firms account for a minority. The situation of ordering and settling foreign exchange from abroad can be divided into three categories: (1) Foreign exchange has been fully paid; (2) Part of the foreign exchange has been paid; (3) No foreign exchange has been paid at all, and credit is guaranteed. Among the above three types of cotton importers, those applying to the China Trust Bureau for purchase are mostly the third type. For the first and second types of importers, due to the excessively high purchase price and the loss of official exchange rate settlement, and there are also unresolved resale disputes in transactions, most of them have been delayed. The disputes regarding the part of foreign cotton arriving at the port that importers buy and sell on behalf of customers are as follows: (1) Part of the foreign exchange has been paid by each customer in advance when ordering from abroad; (2) The surplus part of the price at the time of ordering and the current price, and the compensation problem for the part of the business that importers operate themselves has been ordered but the futures have been sold in advance when the goods have not arrived, and the goods have arrived but Zhu can deliver the goods, etc., have not been resolved.</p>
<h3>No Improvement in Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Bidding Prices Still Decline</h3>
<p>The market condition of cotton yarn yesterday was characterized by mediocre demand. In addition, the bidding prices of cloth downstream still declined, especially the 42-count fine yarn declined the most. Lanfeng yarn continued to fall by 600,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 16.7 million yuan. 20-count Teshuang Mabu fell by 200,000 yuan, to 11.7 million yuan. Qingshuang was 10.5 million, down 150,000. 16-count Guangming also fell by 150,000, to 9.3 million yuan. The other various coarse and fine yarns uniformly fell by 100,000 to 400,000 or 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The market condition of cotton cloth was characterized by Guangzhou's price being higher than the cost price, business being sluggish, and sales in Hankou and the Yangtze River area also being sluggish. In addition, the market's money supply was slightly tight, and cargo owners frequently liquidated their positions. Finally, the price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was as low as 425,000 yuan, a drop of 7,000 or 8,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths such as Wufu, Lanji, and Caiqiu also fell by 4,000, 5,000, or 6,000 yuan. The prices of other factory plates such as Shilin cloth were also partially reduced, so prices were not strong. The prices of cloths supplied and sold by the Textile Construction Company were similar to market prices, and applications were not very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton is Still Soft</p>
<p>The trend of raw cotton yesterday was still weak. The market condition had more supply than demand, and people's hearts were weak. Transactions were sporadic. Furthermore, cotton yarn fell, and yarn factories and customer gangs had small profits. Market prices uniformly looked down. The trading volume of various grades was very small. The price of Lingbao sent to the factory was 21.1 million yuan, the price of delivery at the pier was 2.1 million yuan, Huoji was 1.7 million yuan, Nantancang was 1.8 million yuan, and Zhoupu cottonseed was 330,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Roma Libbatwin, managed by Fule Company, arrived in port the day before yesterday, carrying 18,000 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, India, and 20 pieces of sandalwood. Most of the above cotton, except for a small part of the Central Textile, was purchased by merchants. According to the company, this cotton is stacked in two warehouses, 5,400 pieces are stacked at the Jianyuan Wharf, and 12,600 pieces are stacked at the Chuhepinghe Wharf. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau's Cai E ship returned to Shanghai from Yingkou yesterday, carrying 1,600 tons of pig iron.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bonds Sell Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of July. The sales figures of US dollar bonds were exceptionally high on that day due to the rush of customers and the interest rate relationship for the month. For the government bond part, a total of 145,000 US dollars were sold, with the textile factory sector accounting for the largest majority. For the treasury bond part, a total of 1,246,770 US dollars, equivalent to 14.961.24 billion legal currency, were sold.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Slightly Better, Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>
<p>Government bonds were firm mid-session yesterday, but retreated after rising. Unified Class C opened at 9700 yuan. Chaozhou and 503 Room buyers were active, pushing it up to a high of 10,500 yuan. Later, 360 Room and 555 Room closed their positions, bringing it down slightly to close near the 10,000 yuan level. Various other bonds also retreated from their highs, resulting in Classes A, B, and E each rising 200 yuan, Unified Class C rising 400 yuan, and Unified Class D also improving by 300 yuan. Total turnover was approximately 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>In foreign stocks yesterday, hot stocks Ewo Silk and British American Tobacco saw absorption by securities firm large account holder Mr. Tong, initially low, then high, with a competitive surge in prices. Paper continued its downward trend, with supplies from Guangbang and foreign firms, and money exchange businesses also entering the market. Ewo Silk opened at 82,500 yuan in the morning, rising from 81,500 to close at 84,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, paper stocks fell by half a percentage point, Wheelock Marden and Steel slipped slightly, the Yip Fung Shipping were flat, Ewo Silk and Ewo Brewery rose slightly, and British American Tobacco rose by slightly less than half a percentage point.</p>
<h3>Temporary Short Covering at Closing, Chinese Stocks Initially Weak Then Firm</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were very unfavorable at the opening yesterday, influenced by swaps. Although there were reports of settled order loans, the delayed Sino-Japanese trade was rejected by the Executive Yuan, and news that the Ministry of Finance had ordered banks and money shops to disallow same-day check cashing was prevalent, resulting in more selling pressure than buying. Until closing, temporary short covering emerged, and because checks could not be cashed on the same day, pending negotiations by the association, short sellers could not sustain the pressure, resulting in short squeezes and a rebound. Small stocks New Guangming and Jingfu, encouraged by further capital increases, closed at their highest prices.</p>
<p>Opening weak in the morning, Delivered Yong An Silk opened low at 29 yuan, with No. 153 further selling down to 217 yuan. Nos. 22, 36, 224, 112, 2, and 186 bought in succession, rebounding to 239 yuan. Nos. 231 and 117 closed their positions at high prices, causing slight consolidation.

After 10:15 AM, Nos. 224, 173, 232, 35, 143, 218, 117, 219, and 112 sold in succession. It was heard that Guangbang aggressively sold both inside and outside the market. Interest rates opened high at 1.8 and 2.25 cents, and it once again consolidated down to around 223 yuan. Nos. 104, 180, and 155 entered the market, pushing it up to 229 yuan.</p>
<p>After 11:35 AM, Nos. 105, 219, 106, and 110 offered sales, again forcing it down to 232 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that the banking community was holding meetings to discuss remedies for the inability to cash checks on the same day. Nos. 12, 83, 234, 24, and 76 covered in succession. The noon close saw Spot Yong An Silk rise to 227 yuan, and Delivered Yong An Silk rise to 232 yuan at closing.</p>
<p>After the close, bid prices were moderate. Small stocks New Guangming and Jingfu, maintained by No. 204, gradually saw increased buying, closing at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, Spot New Guangming alone rose by half a percentage point. Yong An Silk, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose slightly. Xinyi, Meiya, Sino-French, and Xinhua slipped slightly. Qinxing and Yonggong each fell by slightly less than half a percentage point. Datong, Zhongfang, Guohuo Neiyi, Zhongsheng, and Jinglun were flat. Tongyi, Rongfeng, Business, and Cement rose slightly. Huochai and Lianan slipped slightly. For Delivered, New Guangming and Jingfu each rose by slightly more than half a percentage point.

Off-market prices were generally considered moderate.</p>
<h3>Group Profit-Sharing Savings Deposits, Starting First in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Credit Bureau News] Group profit-sharing savings deposits, after the Central Trust Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Savings Association has begun preparing for implementation. There was a previous plan to start on August 11 and hold a profit-sharing lottery on September 1. It is now learned that the bureau, due to printing and other preparations, was unable to complete preparations in time and has scheduled the launch for around August 15. The first profit-sharing distribution is tentatively scheduled for September 25. The purpose of establishing group profit-sharing savings is to encourage savings and attract idle funds. Its functions include: (1) This savings can be used as long-term capital, (2) Guiding the middle class to establish relationships with banks, (3) Absorbing idle funds for the government, (4) Investing in productive enterprises. Based on the above, the significance is clear. Initially, it was planned to be jointly operated by national banks and bureaus. Although the Executive Yuan made changes, it will still initially entrust national banks and bureaus to handle it on behalf of the government, and may in the future entrust commercial banks and firms to act as agents to ensure universality. It is also heard that it will be temporarily launched first in Beijing and Shanghai, gradually extending to the whole country.</p>
<h3>Customs Clearance of Imported Goods, Limited to 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Jianghai reports: Upon inspection and release of imported goods, the Customs normally endorses the original bill of lading and issues it to the merchant, who takes it to the inspection office to apply for inspection or release. The date and time are stamped on the back of the bill of lading, and the inspection group manifest or release detail list is simultaneously sent directly by the general affairs section to the designated inspection office for inspection and release. Under normal circumstances, this detail list should be delivered to the designated inspection office within 24 hours. After receiving the bill of lading, the merchant should check the date and time stamped on the back. If the detail list has not arrived at the designated inspection office after 24 hours, they should immediately report it to the general affairs section or the inspection supervisor of the inspection department for investigation.</p>
<p>Also, import and export merchants and customs brokers who come to the Customs to handle matters should directly deal with the customs officers of each department or the inspectors of each inspection office and must not directly contact the Customs messengers, laborers, customs police, and other miscellaneous personnel for any matters. The messengers and laborers are not allowed to directly accept or deliver customs declarations and bills of lading to merchants or participate in customs declaration, inspection, stamping, release, and other matters. Those who deliberately violate this will be immediately dismissed.</p>

<h3>Weak Market Transactions, Rice Prices Stop Rising and Turn Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets together received over 7,600 shi of rice. Store sales were flat, market transactions were weak, and the market stopped rising and turned downward, re-entering a weak state. Japonica and indica rice both saw a pullback of 10,000 yuan, but high-quality white rice was scarce and profitable, rising in price by 10,000 yuan. Shadow yuan also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. 11 shi of new Japonica rice from Pudong arrived the day before yesterday, and another 7 shi and 5 dou arrived yesterday. The rice quality is still good and very suitable for congee sales.</p>
<p>Although flour factories are firm, the street's absorption is not smooth, remaining flat and weak, lacking vitality, and slightly falling by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran was initially firm but later slack, remaining flat. Soybean cakes had slow rural sales, falling back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans followed the decline of various commodities, falling by varying amounts of 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.

Yesterday morning, rice prices eased back, falling by an average of 10,000 yuan per dan, and oil prices also fell accordingly. Crude vegetable oil has returned to 700,000 yuan. In addition, the Central Trust Bureau has jointly dispatched personnel to the rapeseed producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to purchase raw materials, and 50,000 dan of goods have already been shipped to Shanghai, with 3,500 dan of vegetable oil extracted. The Zhongzhi Oil Factory, in order to suppress the rising trend, specifically sold 1,000 dan of vegetable oil from the factory's reserves to the market yesterday, but customers had weak demand, and prices turned down.</p>
<h3>Chen Qimen Tea is Firm and Excellent</h3>
<p>Domestic tea sales in the street and by out-of-town merchants continued steadily yesterday, especially for mid-grade Chen Qimen and Wuxi tea, which are in increasing demand. Prices have been soaring as sellers seize the opportunity to raise them. Other varieties have also followed suit. As for the foreign tea market, buying remains subdued, and sellers are hesitant.

<h3>Deliberation on Chen Tea Prices, Three-Step Decision</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Price Review Committee for Government Procurement of Materials, acting on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon to deliberate on the prices of Chen tea for the 35th year of the Republic. Representatives from the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Farmers Bank of China, the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the Audit Department, and others attended. After discussion, three points were decided: (1) The Farmers Bank of China, the China Tea United Company, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau will first jointly assess the prices of Chen tea at all levels. (2) Before the valuation and purchase, if the tea merchants need to finance their working capital, they can apply to the Central Trust Bureau for advance payment of a portion of the price of the Chen tea. (3) The application deadline for the purchase was originally the 25th of last month. Because some tea merchants have not yet applied by the deadline, and after the Tea Merchants Association explained the reasons for the delay, it was specially approved to allow them to apply retroactively.</p>
<h3>Silk Reeling Industry in Three Districts Holds Second Membership Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Silk Reeling Industry Association in the Three Districts held its second membership meeting at 4 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, chaired by Chu Fucheng. Three points were resolved: (1) Starting in July of this year, membership fees will be increased.

<h3>Nine Associations of the Reproduction Industry Meet to Discuss Increasing Yarn Allocation, Deciding to First Investigate the Actual Needs of Each Factory</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The nine industry associations affiliated with the reproduction industry in this city held a joint meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant at 7 PM yesterday to discuss how to increase the amount of yarn allocated to the industry and the issue of opening trade with Japan. More than 20 representatives from the dyeing and weaving, handkerchief, knitting, underwear, and towel blanket industries attended, chaired by Pan Shihao, chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan reported on the progress of repeated negotiations with the Spinning Adjustment Committee and the Spinning Construction Company regarding increasing the yarn allocation for the reproduction industry in this city. The details are as follows: (1) The yarn demand of the reproduction industry in this city is estimated at 52,000 pieces per month this spring, but the current actual allocation only meets one-fifth of the industry's needs. (2) The Spinning Adjustment Committee's current spinning adjustment policy is quite active, and it is imperative to outsource weaving for the industry. (3) The implementation of the current spinning management and adjustment policy is actually a derivative of the unified purchase and sale policy of flower yarn cloth in the Great Rear Area in the 32nd year of the Republic. However, the industry pointed out the differences in the current situation: (A) There is a shortage of spindles and a surplus of looms. (B) The Great Rear Area was striving to acquire and export materials, which is different now. (C) Sales are difficult and distribution is challenging.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan immediately moved three proposals for discussion on the meeting floor: (1) Re-investigate the production equipment of the industry. (2) Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, Japan will focus on exporting cotton textiles to Southeast Asia, and the reproduction industry should express its opinions. (3) Prepare a plan for the products of the industry to coordinate with outsourcing weaving and export. The nine industry associations then reported on the recent allocation of cotton yarn in each industry. The final resolutions were: (1) The nine industry associations should promptly investigate the number of member companies, production conditions, and yarn demand of their members, as well as the amount that still needs to be supplied by the black market in addition to the Spinning Construction allocation, and create a plan within two days to request an increase in the yarn allocation from the authorities. (2) In order to strengthen the connection between the nine industry associations, it was decided to temporarily establish a joint communication office for the nine associations affiliated with the reproduction industry within the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association in this city.</p>
<h3>Gu Geng Talks About the European and American Bristle Market, Chongqing Bristles are Already Threatened</h3>
<p>Gu Geng, General Manager of Sichuan Livestock Products Company, a leading authority in the bristle industry, went to Europe and the United States in April of this year to investigate and discuss business matters. He returned to China at the beginning of this month. Mr. Gu arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing a few days ago. A reporter from the United Credit Bureau visited him yesterday to understand the situation in the European and American markets and the future of our bristle industry. According to him, the largest market for our bristles is the United States, followed by the United Kingdom in Europe. The United States imports 7 million pounds annually, equivalent to over 50,000 boxes. Judging from the quantity of our exports in the past few months of this year, it may not be as much as last year. One reason is that the United States has millions of pounds of bristle reserves, reducing the need for imports. The second reason is nylon, which is hard and uniform in quality, comparable to Chongqing bristles, and is largely replacing them. However, Chongqing bristles are still indispensable for industrial bristle brushes and are still needed. If the United States greatly increases the production of nylon in the future, it will be a fatal blow to Chongqing bristles. Therefore, the international market price of Chongqing bristles is trending lower. Currently, it is 2.20 yuan per pound, compared to 1.50 yuan before the war, which is less than double the pre-war price. Tianjin bristles are in great demand as raw materials for oil paint industrial bristle brushes. Grade 555 can be as high as 7.78 yuan per pound, and Grade 555 can also be sold for 4.50 yuan. Shanghai bristles also have a market, with a current price of 1.95 yuan. Hankou bristles are used for blending. For example, if Tianjin and Shanghai bristles are used for oil paint bristle brushes, they must be mixed with Hankou bristles, with a current price of 3.35 yuan. The above is the situation in the US market. In Europe, the United Kingdom can sell up to 2,000 boxes, at 13 shillings and 6 pence per pound. Other countries such as France, Switzerland, and Belgium also have sales, but the quantity is not large, totaling no more than several hundred boxes. Germany is currently planning to revive its industry, requiring a large quantity of bristles, and mostly using short bristles, which is the best market for Chongqing bristles. It is currently negotiating with the occupying countries. If it is realized, it will be a major turning point for Chongqing bristles.</p>
<h3>Holders Unwilling to Sell, Rayon Market Revitalized, Factory Silk Slightly Weak, Silk Goods High Then Low</h3>
<p>The rayon market revitalized again yesterday. The opening was very flat, but after rumors spread that the Central Trust Bureau's allocation price would double, confidence was restored, and holders were determined not to sell. No. 120 Gaoshan Youshan opened at 24.5 million yuan and rose immediately, with transactions at 4.90 million yuan. The highest was 5.3 million yuan. In the afternoon, buyers remained cautious and slightly lowered prices. The final price was 25 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The factory silk market was slightly weak yesterday. The asking price for high uniformity five-dan silk was about 500,000 yuan lower, but there were no transactions. The transaction price for medium-grade silk was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The opening price was 27 million yuan, and the opening price for high-grade silk was 28 million yuan, both with ten-day terms. For 28/30-thread, 75% uniformity E-grade silk, there were five dan of transactions yesterday, with a seven-day term price of 28.2 million yuan. For 28-thread dry silk, there was an order for 17.3 million yuan, another dan for 7 million yuan, and the lower grade for 16 million yuan, all with ten-day terms.</p>
<p>The silk goods market was high then low yesterday. For pure silk quilt covers, because there were more sellers than buyers, the market was high then low. Dacheng goods opened weak, with transactions at 400,000 yuan. In the middle, it reached 450,000 to 500,000 yuan, then fell back to 400,000 yuan at the closing spot price. Huaqiang goods initially made 10.37 million yuan, then a maximum of 4.5 million yuan, and finally closed lower at 3.17 million yuan spot, and 4 million yuan with a one-day delay. Dacheng plaid crepe initially made 12.8 million yuan, and the final transaction was 34,000 yuan, 800 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of Huajin crepe also slightly increased yesterday due to the high price of rayon, with high-grade goods being transacted at 22.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Jinshan Twigs Slightly Loose</p>
<p>About a hundred pieces of Jinshan twigs were previously closed out. Yuanzhi was 1.289 million to 1.3 million yuan, Bianzhi was 1.7 million to 1.65 million yuan, and the others were between 1 million and 900,000 yuan. The market was stable, slightly looser than before.</p>
<h3>Final Meeting of the Spinning Management Committee Decides on the Handling of Surplus Funds</h3>
<p>Request the Executive Yuan to Quickly Establish a Management and Utilization Committee</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The former Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its last meeting at the Municipal Government at approximately 3 PM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Wu Guozhen. Many committee members and executive directors of the six district associations attended, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 5 PM.</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, the handling of the 97.8 billion yuan in surplus funds accumulated after the purchase and sale of cotton yarn during the period of the former Spinning Management Committee was discussed in detail. During the tenure of former Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, the Spinning Management Committee, in order to manage the funds, had requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the establishment of a Fund Management and Utilization Committee for Promoting Cotton Planting and Developing the Textile Industry, but it has not yet received approval. Currently, 10.3 billion yuan of the total funds have been transferred by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, including the start-up costs of the current Spinning Adjustment Committee, the dissolution costs of the former Spinning Management Committee, and some investment projects of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After yesterday's discussion, some yarn factory members believed that the transfer and use of the funds were somewhat inappropriate and inconsistent with the original purpose of accumulating the funds. It was decided to request the Executive Yuan to quickly establish the Fund Management and Utilization Committee, with nine members, including three from private factories, two from state-owned factories, and four from the government, in order to jointly discuss a proper use of the funds.</p>

<h3>Communist Party Connections with Japanese Military Advisors, Gangs in Guangdong and Guangxi Cause Trouble, Looting Civilian Guns and Food</h3>
<p>[Our Wuzhou Correspondent] This reporter, with a heart half-filled with worry and resentment, half with fear, wandered through the green of the mountains connecting southern China and the Shiwan Mountains, feeling as if he were treading on the surface of a festering sore. General Zhang Fakui was right when he said, "I still believe that there are no formal Communist Party troops in Guangdong and Guangxi." These roots of disaster in the south have erected a banner calling themselves the "South Road People's Armed Liberation Army." A closer look reveals that they are actually a band of thieves – a group of bandits causing trouble under the influence of the Communist Party. The so-called "CPC South China Bureau Guangdong Armed Work Committee" is their master.</p>
<p>The South Road bandit gangs, spreading across the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, were initially estimated by officials to number only three to five thousand, with just over a thousand in Guangxi. Later, due to the lean season and severe famine, people turned to banditry, creating a situation that became difficult to control. According to this reporter's investigation, the bandits gathered in the area south of Luchuan County to the north of Lianjiang, led by Zou Youning and Liang Banwei, are said to number as many as three thousand. As for those scattered in the counties of Huazhou, Wuchuan, Lianjiang, and Suixi, their number is estimated to be between five and six thousand. In the Leizhou Zhanjiang area, those led by Fu Chunmao also number more than four thousand. They generally have an elegant name of "Democratic Allied Army." The number of these titles is so great that even the "headquarters" of the "Allied Army" cannot keep track of them.</p>
<p>Five "Tasks" of South Road Bandits</p>
<p>The style of the South Road bandits would not be a cause for great concern, but when the word "traitor" is added to the word "bandit" to become "traitorous bandits" acting in concert with the communists, the headache is much greater than usual. According to a written order from the traitorous bandit leader that this reporter found from relevant sources, there are five major tasks: (1) Burn as much as possible of everything that can be burned; (2) Kill and loot villages to create a climate of terror; (3) Send personnel to Zhanjiang to blow up military warehouses; (4) Actively sabotage all transportation on the South Road; (5) Loot as many vehicles as possible. This is considered to be the most recent "working program." Therefore, in the midst of the chaos, traveling east from Yulin to Luchuan, one can experience countless tense situations. According to the common people, after the Qingming Festival, the bandits consolidate from dispersed groups and are active everywhere. In the villages south of Luchuan, such as Liangtian and Chentian, the township offices are often besieged. The areas around Lianjiang Lizhi and Fanling have become the bandits' territory, where they burn, kill, loot, and commit all kinds of atrocities. Those wearing civil servant uniforms or military uniforms, once captured, are killed immediately without any questions. Countless grassroots personnel in the villages have died at the hands of the bandits. In the four rural districts of Suixi County, nineteen are occupied by bandits. The bandits from Donghe to Maling Anpu have a rather well-organized structure. There are advisory groups from the Chinese Communist Party in the command structure, and it is rumored that there are several Japanese people holding the title of senior advisors, directing the operations from within. Under the "headquarters" there are staff, intelligence, political, and liaison departments, each with its own responsibilities. These "democratic armies" are best at making false claims and turning nothing into something. Often, three to five hundred people run around looting, creating a network of deceptive information. Just as government forces are gathering to launch a sweep, the traitorous bandits scatter without a trace. When the government forces are slightly weaker, they regroup and attack again, leaving the local area with nothing.</p>
<p>Bandit Gangs in the Lianjiang Guangzhou Bay Area Extort "Protection Fees"</p>
<p>Since the county magistrate of Suixi County, Guangdong, was killed by traitorous bandits, the banditry has increased unabated. Wherever they go, the traitorous bandits issue declarations and appoint county magistrates (such as Qu Wenxi and Chen Kailian as the chief and deputy puppet magistrates of Suixi County), attack the government, and do everything possible to rebel. On the one hand, they set up checkpoints and collect taxes on water transport. Every boat from Lianjiang to Guangzhou Bay is charged a monthly "protection fee" of 60,000 yuan - now increased to 90,000 yuan. On the highway at the junction of Lianjiang and Suixi Counties from Chikan (under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou Bay) to Anpu, a tall sign of the "Democratic Allied Army" is conspicuously displayed, openly collecting taxes from passing merchants. The tax standard is 20% of the value of the goods, and the value of the goods is determined by the bandits themselves. Often, the estimated tax is higher than the value of the goods. At this time, the merchants have no choice but to admit their bad luck, leave the goods on the spot, and walk away. Those who are lucky enough to pass through have to go through the "proper channels" as well, and once they pass through the gate, they have to pay another batch of "protection fees." After all the protection, by the time they reach their destination, they are already heartbroken and want to cry but have no tears. This makes those who carry goods over long distances regard it as a dangerous road. However, for the sake of survival, they have to take risks. Sometimes, if they have connections, they can negotiate a "deal" - which means "to get along well." Even if the goods are rolling around, they won't be harmed.</p>
<p>"Wild Boar Famine Army" Actually Fires Guns and Writes IOUs</p>
<p>Passenger and cargo vehicles traveling between Yulin and Guangzhou Bay often fail to pass the "Old Friend, Lend Us Some" checkpoint more than six out of ten times. With a shout of "Stop!", the ambush heroes aim at the tires and fire a shot, completely deflating the tires. Then, the "Wild Boar Famine Army" - (Note: The common people like to mistake this group of "Democratic Liberation Army" for "Wild Boar Famine Army," which has a profound meaning) - rush up and strip even the women of their underwear before leaving. Some even politely write an IOU: "This is to acknowledge that we have borrowed the funds from the passengers of car number ××××, amounting to approximately so many yuan, which will be repaid without fail after the success of the revolution. This is the receipt, South Road Democratic Liberation Army No. × Squad," which is truly a great farce.</p>
<p>This scene happened last month near Pifang Bridge on the Yulin-Zhanjiang Highway and near Shijiaota in Leizhou to Zhanjiang. Unfortunately, this reporter was unable to witness it.</p>
<p>Big "Thieves" Go Everywhere, Demand Guns and Food, It Has Become an Iron Rule. In the Villages of Lianjiang and Luchuan, All Civilian Guns and Food Have Been Almost Completely "Struggled" Away. For Example, in Sanhe Township, Lianjiang, Which Has Been Looted by Bandits Several Times, "Not a Single Gun Remains, Not a Single Grain Remains." The Common People Cannot Endure the Hardship, and the Number of Deaths is Countless! As a Result of the Atrocities of the Traitorous Bandits, the Villagers Are Coerced to Hand Over All Their Weapons and Food. If They Fail to Comply, They Are Subjected to Cruel Torture, Even Using the Tendons from Cotton-Ginning Machines to Tightly Tie the Heads of the Victims. The Heads Are Twisted on Both Sides, the Tendons Are Embedded in the Flesh, and Blood Is Shed, Causing Blood to Flow From the Seven Orifices. Such a Horrible Sight Makes Even Those Who Hear About It Tremble. For Example, Yang Daguang, a Villager in a Certain Village in Suixi County, Suffered This Kind of Torture. Other "Good Policies" Such as "Flying Airplane," "Lighting Sky Lanterns," Etc., Imposed by the Bandits on Petty Landlords, Merchants, and Public Servants During "Purges" Are Not Counted Here. (Liang Xiaozhong, July 28)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Security Command Officially Reorganized and Established</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 31st] The Zhejiang Security Command will be officially reorganized and established tomorrow.

[Another News] Following the bandit areas in the Siming Mountains, the bandit gangs on the border between Zhejiang and Anhui are becoming increasingly active. More than 300 of them, from the border areas of Ningguo, Jixi, and Jing County, are causing disturbances in Zhejiang. After being surrounded and attacked by the Zhejiang Security forces, more than a dozen of them were killed or injured, and the bandits fled back to the deep mountains. Strict precautions are currently being taken.</p>
<h3>Packs of Wolves in Longyou, Villagers Afraid to Leave Their Homes</h3>
<p>[Our Longyou Correspondent] In recent days, packs of wolves have been appearing in various townships in the northern district of Longyou County, harming people and livestock.

<h3>Disturbance in Zhenhai Yet to be Settled, Authorities Urged to Search and Arrest</h3>
<p>[Zhenhai News] During the period when Zhenhai County was occupied, bandits were rampant, kidnapping, robbing, and excavating tombs, causing great suffering to the people. These people have recently gathered again, lurking in Jinquan Township and Wushi'ao in Yin County, committing illegal acts. Although the notorious bandits Zhang Wending, Zhu Lishui, and Xu Weitang have been arrested, there are still many of their leaders, and there is a great tendency for them to collude with the Communist Party. Strict punishment should be imposed to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Murder Case: Abandoned Corpse in the Grass, Truth Comes to Light, Victim is the Young Owner of Zhengde Printing House, Culprits You Kaiyun and Wu Lixing Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Correspondent, 31st] This assassination and corpse-moving case that occurred more than ten days ago has attracted much attention from all walks of life. After a secret investigation by the security authorities for ten days, it was learned that the deceased was Huang Yingmei, the son of the manager of the Zhengde Printing House in this city. Huang had just returned to Rong from Taiwan and was very close to You Kaiyun and Wu Lixing. The three had jointly participated in a secret Communist Party organization, but Huang intended to withdraw from the party. You and Wu feared that Huang would leak secrets to the outside world, so they decided to kill him. A few days ago, they invited Huang to You's house, a former rice warehouse, for dinner. Taking advantage of Huang's lack of preparation, they strangled him to death together, cut his body into several pieces with a knife, and abandoned it in the weeds in a nearby open space, and robbed Huang of the gold ring and watch on his body. Afterwards, it was discovered and reported to the police by nearby residents. The murderer has now been arrested and has confessed to the killing.

<h3>Hardship March in Northern Jiangsu, Efforts to Catch "Rats"</h3>
<p>The mercury column of Hua's scale rises to ninety-eight degrees, the red sun is scorching, and sweat is pouring down like a waterfall. The national army of northern Jiangsu, in coordination with local forces, is carrying out a great task of suppressing the rebellion in the midst of the hot summer - the pacification area's suppression battle.</p>
<p>The battle of suppression is unfolding in the long, desolate coastal area. From Sanyu Town to Juegang, Fengli, Pincha... to the rural areas of Dongtai 1, 2, and 3 Canghe, the soldiers, loaded with all their equipment, are searching and advancing from one town to another, from one village to another. The weather is extremely hot, and the march is extremely difficult. Both people and horses are panting from the heat, and sweat is wiped off by the handful. During rest, the small river becomes a great gift to the public. Jumping into the river and taking a cold bath, they feel unparalleled refreshment all over their bodies. Sometimes the weather changes and a heavy rain falls, drenching everyone from top to bottom. After the rain, the roads are muddy, and they rush to the camp in a bumpy fashion. At night, they have to deal with the harassment of mosquitoes and prevent possible ambushes.</p>
<p>"Suppressing bandits is like catching rats." If you want to catch them, they will hide everywhere. If you don't pay attention to them, they will immediately come out to steal and destroy things. The national army of the northern Jiangsu pacification area is determined to use the determination and means of catching rats to pursue and suppress them everywhere, overturning nests and wanting to completely eliminate these rats that are causing trouble in northern Jiangsu. As usual, the Communist bandits are using their housekeeping skills, running around and fleeing wildly, and using cruel tactics, leaving those local "militia" behind as cover, letting them be their shields. In this suppression battle, the national army encountered fierce battles with the remnants of the bandits. All the captures, in addition to what has been seen in the newspapers and telegraphs, are those "meat rats"!</p>
<p>In this suppression, whenever the national army arrives in a place, the township and village chiefs immediately enter the area with them to reorganize the baojia system, appease the people, and search for scattered bandits. This is a great blow to the Communist bandits, because the township and village chiefs are local people. After returning to their hometowns, everything is familiar to them, especially the identification of accomplices. They can see everything clearly. The military authorities search for a large number of suspects and immediately send them to them for identification. Who is a bandit accomplice, who is the most violent participant in "struggle" and unrest, and who has not participated in the bandit army's work is identified by them one by one without any errors. Among them, accomplices are sent to the rear for punishment according to the severity of their circumstances. Those without suspicion of being bandits are immediately released and will never be detained or harassed, so that the people in the bandit area do not feel distressed or afraid. At the same time, it is absolutely impossible for bandits to try to use the stealth method and mix in with them. Many people who have been ravaged by the Communist bandits for a long time have now obtained true "liberation."</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu is the granary of the Communist bandits, and the coastal area is their main base for causing trouble, because this is a vast wilderness, and it is not facing the highway, which is suitable for them to use as a "rat hole." From here, the public grain of northern Jiangsu is secretly transported to southern Shandong to supply the bandit army in Shandong, and from there, ammunition and the bandit army are transported back here. This spring, some of the bandits in Shandong fled back to northern Jiangsu, and many of them took the sea route through the coastal area. This time, the national army rushed to the coast and launched a fierce attack. The remnants of the bandits were unable to turn around, so they boarded boats and fled to the sea. They were bombed and strafed by the government air force, and many were wiped out. In addition to launching the suppression in the coastal area, the national army has also begun to coordinate its actions in the river areas south of the Tongyang Road, preparing to force the remnants of the bandits along the river and coast to move inland, and then launch a large-scale suppression. During the wheat harvest this summer, the remnants of the bandits caused a lot of commotion in the countryside, causing chaos. Before the autumn harvest, the pacification authorities took this swift action to deal a fatal blow to the remnants of the bandits. Farmers will surely be able to maintain considerable stability during this year's autumn harvest.</p>

<h3>A Bolt of Lightning Kills Five People</h3>
<p>[Changshu News] On the afternoon of the 27th, Donglai Town in the Shazhou District of Changshu was suddenly overcast, and a torrential rain came suddenly, like a downpour. Five nearby residents, Liu Guibiao, Wu Linbao, Wu Er, Ding Mulang, etc., were sheltering from the rain under the eaves. When the rain eased, the five immediately went home in the rain. Soon after, four villagers, Liu Laoer (over forty years old), Liu Honglang (sixteen years old), father and son, and Wu Tongbao (twenty-three years old) and Wu Wangshi (twenty-two years old), husband and wife, came to the eaves to shelter from the rain. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck, killing all four of them. Wu Tongbao's death was the most tragic, with his skull torn off. Wu Wangshi was six months pregnant and suffered the same disaster. As a result, a total of five people were killed.</p>
<h3>Breaches in the Seashore River Dikes in Haizhou, Farmland Becomes a Vast Ocean</h3>
<p>[Our Haizhou Correspondent] Although the western dikes of the Seashore Rose River in Donghai were repaired with work relief, the water势 upstream to the west was enormous, causing breaches in several places. All villages south of the railway line were submerged. The townships of Zhubu and Shanglin north of the railway line were also partially flooded, and the Xu-Hai Highway was several feet deep. The rivers of Houyan Boyang and other rivers in Guanyun County have not been repaired for many years and have successively reported breaches. Hundreds of miles in all directions, everywhere is an ocean, and half of the county's farmland has sunk. The Guan-Xin-Hai Xin and other highways were submerged by water on the 22nd. (July 21-22)</p>

<h3>A Pair of Wild Lovebirds Commit a Murder in the Middle of the Night, Melon Vendor Stabbed Four Times to Death, Culprits Arrested and Confess Without Denying</h3>
<p>[Our Dangtu Correspondent] A resident named Shen Yu in Santiao Alley, East Main Street, Changtu County, is currently a grain police officer at the Zhajiiawan Grain Branch. His wife, Shen Sunshi, is 42 years old. Sunshi is promiscuous and has an affair with Chen Jiansan (33 years old) from Sichuan, who has now retired from the military. Before Shen Yu went to Zhajiia Town, he entrusted Dong Jinan, a melon vendor who sold watermelons at his door, to take care of his household. Dong Jinan (45 years old, from Yuncheng, Shandong) had a quarrel with Shen Sunshi a few days ago, so Jinan forbade Chen Jiansan from interacting with her, which caused Chen Jiansan and Shen Sunshi (see photo) to harbor resentment in their hearts. Suddenly, at about 2:00 a.m. yesterday (July 28), Chen Jiansan and Shen Sunshi used a small pointed knife for selling watermelons to quickly stab Dong Jinan four times while he was fast asleep, killing him instantly. Afterwards, they planned to move the body to a secluded place. A wonton vendor happened to catch a glimpse. The murderer, Chen Jiansan, seeing that the situation was not good, fled through the Xiaojia Alley across the street and threw the murder weapon into the Xiaojia Alley. Shen Sunshi was even more anxious when she saw this, and used the trick of covering her ears to steal the bell to avoid suspicion. She shouted loudly: Someone has been stabbed to death! Neighbors rushed to the scene after hearing the sound and saw Dong Jinan lying miserably in a pool of blood (see photo). The criminal police team then arrested Shen Sunshi and brought her to justice. At about 8:00 a.m., the murderer Chen Jiansan was captured behind the Lvzu Temple at the west end of Tishu Street, taken to the police station and transferred to the judicial office. The judicial office sent clerk Xue Mianbin to examine the body. There was a knife wound on the neck that penetrated the neck, a knife wound on the right chest, a knife wound on the left collarbone, and a knife wound on the shoulder, confirming that he had been killed. There were still blood stains on the murderer's body, and he confessed without denying. (29th)</p>

<h3>Difficult to Develop Work in Hebei Supervision Office, Numerous Corruption Accusation Cases, Lack of Investigation Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 31st] The Hebei Supervisory Office息; The trend of the people of Hebei in the two cities of Pingjin accusing corruption is very strong. Recently, the office receives an average of no less than 20 complaints per month. Because the entire office's investigation fee is only more than 500,000 yuan per month, the work cannot be actively developed.</p>
<h3>Mata Hari Song Manping Arrested in Wuhe County</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent] In mid-month, a Mata Hari case was uncovered in Wuhe County, eastern Anhui Province. The protagonist in the case was Song Manping, who graduated from the Yan'an Anti-Japanese University. Miss Song, a native of Sichuan, is 26 years old and has a beautiful appearance. Last spring, Miss Song secretly came to Anhui to work on intelligence and made contact with Li Yangzheng, a Communist bandit from Sixian County. Li used his hometown relationship, and the two cohabited, appearing as husband and wife. By autumn, Sixian County was recovered by the national army, and Li fled Sixian County and went to Jiashan, where he surrendered to the investigation office. After being given a title by the investigation office, he worked there. Song also fled to Jiashan and continued to live with Li. Li was again bewitched by her. Last winter, he resigned and went to Wuhe with her to live temporarily. This spring, Song expressed great dissatisfaction with Li's lack of willpower. Li then went elsewhere. Miss Song remained in Wuhe. She then fell in love with Huang Zhenqiu, the police chief of the county's police security team. Song took the opportunity to incite Huang to lead the team in a mutiny and harm Wuhe. Huang was swayed by her. Just as he was about to act, the matter was heard by County Magistrate Jiang Zhenglun. Jiang used swift and decisive means to capture Huang and Song together. According to County Magistrate Jiang, he has scolded Chief Huang to his face. Although Song Manping was rigorously interrogated by himself, she only lowered her head and wept, and firmly denied that she was working as a spy for the Communist bandits. It is learned that Jiang attaches great importance to this case and has reported it to the Anhui Provincial Government and requested instructions. (July 29)</p>
<h3>Person in Prison Accuses Person Outside Prison, Traitor Liu Zhensheng Petitions for Return of Bribe Money</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 31st] Former prosecutor of the Hebei High Court, and current chief prosecutor of the Luan County District Court, Sun Chengxi, was accused in a presentation by the jailed traitor Liu Zhensheng at the Hebei Supervisory Office, claiming that Sun accepted a bribe of 5 million yuan while serving in the Hebei High Court, promising to release him but failing to do so, and requested severe punishment. The presentation stated that Liu was arrested in January last year as a traitor. After being transferred to the Hebei High Court, his case was investigated by Sun Xianxi. At that time, a fellow inmate, Wang Yaofu, who had served as a puppet county magistrate, told Liu that he was on good terms with Prosecutor Sun. Wang was indeed released in November. Half a month later, Wang went to Liu's house and said that Prosecutor Sun had agreed to release Liu, but he had to pay 5 million yuan first. At the end of December, Sun was suddenly ordered to transfer to a county post. In January of this year, Wang wrote to Liu, stating that the case had been taken over by another prosecutor, and the 5 million yuan would be returned. After demanding it without success, Liu filed a complaint and requested the arrest of Wang and an investigation.</p>

<h3>Lychees Fill the Sky</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>Eight years ago, during a sweltering summer, I traveled in the southern regions. As the sun set, I loved to wander around Lychee Bay, strolling among the houseboats on the water, relieving the weariness of the day's work. I also deeply savored the Southern delicacy with small seeds, thick flesh, abundant juice, and sweet taste—the lychee.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would walk along the shore, where lychee fruits were densely clustered on the vermilion doors and mud walls, hanging high above six meters. The sight of "thousands upon thousands, crimson pearls uniformly distributed," extending beyond the walls, inevitably causing one's mouth to water, is something I still fondly remember!</p>
<p>The "Compendium of Materia Medica" states: "Of the eight commanderies in the South, lychees are most famous." It also says: "Lychee shells are red and the flesh is white, sweet, juicy, and delicious." Xu Yin of the Tang Dynasty wrote lychee poems that were quite popular. I imagine he was also a lychee enthusiast. I might as well record two of them for everyone to enjoy, perhaps as a delightful way to beat the summer heat, in addition to plums and melons. The poems are as follows:</p>
<p>"Day after day, the warm wind rolls up the miasmic haze; the lychee is the first precious fruit of the South. Clever crows peck open, droplets of jade-like juice; precious vessels hold the round belly of a clam. In Jinli, it is only known to quench thirst after intoxication; in the Palace of Nectar, it is fit to be a gift for the gods. Who has pricked out the blood of an orangutan, deeply dyeing the patterned veins all over the fresh shell?" "Crimson bullets and starry spheres gleam in the sunlight, green jade branches scatter small fragrant pouches. Dragon silk reveals crimson-veined rice; fish eyes contain white-fleshed juice.</p>
<p>Plums are ripe, past the rains of the Southern Ridge; sour oranges await the frost of Dongting Lake in vain.</p>
<p>Climbing mountains at dawn, picking them with the smoke, reverently presenting them on golden platters to the King of Yue."</p>
<p>Amidst the yellow wind and miasmic haze, lychees first grow and ripen, possessing the color and flavor of "shells revealing crimson veins and pearls containing white flesh." Once picked, they become precious fruits of the South, even taken to "reverently present them on golden platters to the King of Yue." It is evident to what extent this fruit was valued in the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>Historically, the woman who loved eating lychees the most was Yang Guifei of the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Ming of Tang spared no effort to satisfy her craving for lychees, devising a quick delivery from lychee-producing areas. Given the difficult transportation and lack of tools at the time, the special express delivery that Emperor Ming of Tang could employ was no more than relay stations. Thus, once the imperial decree was issued, a whip led the way, red dust billowed, and the lychees were sent directly to Chang'an. An ancient poem says: "A courier arrives, kicking up red dust, for the sake of the imperial concubine's smile; no one knows it is lychees that are being delivered." This can be said to be a portrait of that lychee-loving concubine (Yang Guifei).</p>
<p>This historical scene has reappeared in today's reality. The only difference is that the relay horses have become airplanes. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th, fresh lychees are already on the market. This year's production is quite abundant, and the price is also affordable, selling for three to four thousand yuan per catty. Merchants, with their wild imaginations, are negotiating to charter airplanes to transport lychees to Beijing and Shanghai for sale. Naturally, this is good news: the news of chartered planes transporting fruit is at least not as unnoticed as the movement of animals (such as pandas). Fruit dealers can make a good profit, needless to say, and the Yang Guifeis of Shanghai will no longer have to brave the summer heat to travel to the southern regions to enjoy fresh lychees in the comfort of electric fans, refrigerators, and air conditioning, as if Lychee Bay has been moved into their mansions. Isn't this enough to be called exceptional good fortune for their palates?</p>
<p>After lychee charter flights fill the sky, I believe sales will surely develop further, but whether the price at the place of origin will remain the same without rising seems to be questionable. If we look at the previous telegram, we know that the situation at the ancient Xichan Temple in Fuzhou, where excellent lychee varieties are widely planted, is already very different. According to past customs, every tourist could eat as much as they wanted by simply paying some incense money, but now this old practice has been broken, and measurements are required for pricing. This means that you can't eat as much as you want; you have to pay for how many lychees you eat. One can imagine how disappointed the local lychee eaters are. This kind of good fortune for the palate will probably have to fall to out-of-province eaters like Yang Guifei.</p>
<h3>The Term "Comrade"</h3>
<p>— Oriental Mist</p>
<p>"Comrade," what a warm and resounding term, but now it sounds truly jarring.</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, the term "comrade" echoed throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, in every corner of the country, following the footsteps of the National Revolutionary Army. Whether it was the chairman, the commander-in-chief, or the workers and service personnel, they could all address each other in this way. At that time, every time I heard someone call me "Comrade Oriental," a surge of pleasure would immediately well up inside me, and I would deeply feel a sense of warmth, friendship, and honor. Who knew that "good times don't last long"? The term "comrade" soon embarked on a path of decline, and in recent years, the value of "comrade" has steadily decreased. It has even developed to the point where it is limited to the exclusive term used by superiors to subordinates, masters to employees, and the honorable to the lowly. There is no longer a trace of friendliness or warmth in this surface, only a signpost indicating the nobility or baseness, the height or lowness of one's status. If you don't believe me, try shouting "So-and-so Comrade" at your superior and see what kind of look they give you. If you don't have any background or family connections, you might even face the fate of being "reassigned to another position." However, perhaps your superior is more enlightened and doesn't take it to heart, but your good colleagues will sneer at you from the sidelines, scolding you for being too ignorant of etiquette.</p>
<p>Several times, I have accompanied our director, secretary, and section chief to gatherings held by dignitaries. When the host introduced the other esteemed guests one by one, saying, "This is Director So-and-so, this is Secretary So-and-so, this is Section Chief So-and-so, this is Mr. Cha…," the other dignitaries would all happily bow and shake hands as a greeting. But when the host hesitated slightly and pointed at me, saying, "This is Comrade Oriental," the smiles on the faces of the dignitaries would immediately disappear, replaced by a forced and reluctant display of teeth. After that, they would talk and laugh animatedly, exceptionally harmonious, while I would be consistently neglected on the sidelines. The reason for this is all because I am a "comrade." "Comrade" is destined to be someone of low rank and humble position, unable to join the ranks of the dignitaries. The reason why our clever host used this most clever term was certainly not to genuinely regard me as a like-minded comrade. It was only to maintain his own status and dignity, implying my status to those dignitaries.</p>
<p>Thinking about it all makes one furious: for a year, I have been working in what is supposedly a revolutionary organization with a friend whom I have known for three years and with whom I am on fairly good terms. Although his position is two levels higher than mine, he has always addressed me as "Brother Mengwu" out of friendship on the official memos he has given me. However, since we had several disagreements over a matter that was neither too big nor too small, the vigorous and upright words "Brother Mengwu" can no longer be found in the official memos he gives me. Instead, it has been replaced by this six-character address, with which I am unusually familiar and which was strangely warm in the past but now indicates the nobility or baseness, the height or lowness of one's status: "Comrade Oriental Mist."</p>
<p>In China, where "democracy" is currently being shouted at the top of one's lungs, I cannot help but burst into tears for this declining "comrade"!</p>
<h3>The Indonesian Question Amidst Slaughter</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>The tense relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia, which had been escalating since May 27, have finally erupted into war. The Dutch army, navy, and air force, equipped with 100,000 modern troops, are currently engaged in mutual slaughter with the indigenous forces of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has ruled Indonesia for 300 years. The disparity in interests between the rulers and the ruled has resulted in a fierce nationalist movement, which is an inevitable fact. Therefore, since the beginning of the 20th century, the Indonesian people's nationalist movement resisting Dutch rule has never ceased. It was not until the establishment of the Indonesian Nationalist Party League in 1939 that the front line of the nationalist movement was consolidated, engaging in effective activities, which caused headaches for the Dutch government.</p>
<p>During World War II, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Indonesia was quickly occupied by Japan, and the Indonesian people strengthened their long-term plans for nation-building. When Japan was defeated and surrendered, the Netherlands planned to make a comeback. However, the 70 million people of Indonesia disregarded all obstacles and pressure and declared the establishment of the "Republic of Indonesia" on August 17, 1945. Then, in November of the same year, the Republic government was established, with Sukarno as president, breaking free from the chains of 300 years of ethnic rule.</p>
<p>However, during the first year, before the Linggadjati Agreement was established, Indonesia's situation was under the dual oppression of the Dutch and British (under the pretext of helping prisoners of war) forces. The war was intermittent, and negotiations were intermittent. It was not until the Linggadjati Agreement was established in November 1946 that the Dutch finally recognized the existence of the Republic of Indonesia, including Java, Sumatra, and Madura as the territory of the Republic. However, the Republic was only a part of the United States of Indonesia (composed of the Republic of Indonesia and other islands in the Dutch East Indies), and it was to form a Dutch-Indonesian Union with the Netherlands proper. This roundabout way shows that the Netherlands has not generously given up its attempt to rule Indonesia and its suzerainty. On May 27 of this year, due to different interpretations of the content of the agreement, the Dutch government finally issued an ultimatum to Indonesia, demanding that the Dutch and Indonesian sides jointly organize police and security forces, and return Dutch property rights and economic development rights. The Dutch side firmly stated that this was the final position of the Netherlands, and the Indonesian side had no room for consideration other than accepting it in full.</p>
<p>Thus, the Dutch-Indonesian situation since May 27 has been unusually severe. After many twists and turns, although Sjahrir formed a middle-of-the-road cabinet, agreeing to the Dutch request to jointly organize police and security forces, it was only with attached conditions, which also dissatisfied the Dutch side. The Dutch cabinet then authorized the Dutch East Indies Acting Governor Van Mook to issue an attack order at the opportune moment, so the conflict in Indonesia was unavoidable and broke out on the 21st of this month. Now, the United Kingdom and the United States have expressed deep regret over this dispute and are seeking ways to mediate it, while Indonesian President Sukarno has appealed to the United Nations, requesting that it be accompanied by reasonable mediation. Therefore, the future development of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute in the mutual slaughter depends on the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>However, there are nearly one million overseas Chinese in Indonesia. They hold the actual power in Indonesian commerce and have suffered considerable losses in the past Dutch-Indonesian disputes. Now, with extremely concerned emotions, we are concerned about the safety of their lives and property. We also hope that the Dutch and Indonesian sides can correct past mistakes and respect the interests of the people of neutral countries.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Auditing at American Universities</p>
<p>In many ways, American universities contribute more to society than any university in China. University education in China is limited to a small number of regular students, and working citizens cannot get involved. Regular students are not only burdened by heavy coursework, but also have to go through formal shackles such as major exams, minor exams, quarterly exams, and monthly exams. The day they successfully complete their studies is often the day their lung disease reaches the end of the third stage. Many top students happily receive their diplomas, but also sadly climb into bed. University education in America is not so rigid and formalized. Higher education institutions rarely have gates at all. You don't have to take an exam to enter; you can study first and then decide. If the purpose is not to earn credits, you can audit as much as you like. Therefore, in addition to regular students, there are all kinds of people, such as lawyers, managers, businessmen, civil servants, middle school teachers, old and young, everything that should be there. The courses they choose are all related to their professions. They work and study at the same time, so that their work ability can be further improved. The government saves the trouble of training civil servants. Classrooms often find old gentlemen and ladies in their seventies and eighties. They have lived to such an age, and it seems that there is no need for further study, but why are they going back to school? They feel that at this age, going to nightclubs is too old, and going to movie theaters is afraid of hurting their presbyopic eyesight. Other activities such as swimming, riding, ice skating, and driving are not for them, but they are unwilling to be lonely, so they audit at universities. On the one hand, they can listen to the great theories of authoritative professors, and on the other hand, they can meet a few young friends and relieve their boredom. Old people have mature and prudent views, so when discussing international issues, professors and students respect the opinions of old people very much. I think that if there are no old students with long beards and wrinkled faces in a university, university education cannot be considered complete or mature. University education is the highest education, not the education of young people. The arrogance, harassment, and endless trends in Chinese universities are all because of immaturity. Old people are not allowed to enter universities, but are only allowed to hang around in temples or teahouses. The wise education authorities do not want to transform universities, but instead regard teahouses as a kind of civic education institution, which is really that education has gone into a dead end.

<p>Zhang Lu, who rose from a "rice thief" (a derogatory term for a Taoist rebel leader), surrendered to the government, was treated as a guest by Cao Cao, and was given the title of Marquis of Ten Thousand Households, with all five of his sons and capable confidants being generously rewarded. Pei Songzhi, the Song Dynasty Grand Master of the Imperial Academy who annotated the Records of the Three Kingdoms, criticized: "Although Zhang Lu had good intentions, he had to surrender after defeat. Now he is favored with ten thousand households, and all five sons are ennobled as marquises. This is excessive!" The implication is that he strongly disapproved of this. In fact, in my opinion, this is precisely where Cao Cao's supreme cleverness lies, a good tactic worthy of special mention.</p>
<p>Because everyone knows that during the seventy or eighty years spanning the late Han and early Wei dynasties, the peasant revolutionary forces, which disguised the truth with religious mysticism, were shaking the position of the rulers of the time to a precarious degree. Zhang Lu, the leader of the "rice thieves" who inherited the political ideology of the Yellow Turbans, according to the Book of Wei in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, had at that time "ruled Bazhong and Hanzhong for nearly thirty years, and the Han dynasty was unable to conquer him at the end of the Han dynasty. Tens of thousands of families from the Guanzhong area fled to him through the Ziwu Trail." His power was very great. From the government's point of view, it would be easy to quell a group of warlord politicians' conspiracies and rebellions, but it would be difficult to subdue the spontaneous power of the masses with this. Because the former is just a rabble, gathered together for profit, and easily dispersed by profit; while the latter has different positions, thoughts, and beliefs, and opposes each other, which cannot be eliminated all at once. Cao Cao understood this distinction, so he did not hesitate to use high-ranking officials and generous salaries to lure, disintegrate, and divide them. And it just so happened that he encountered such a silver-like wax spearhead in Zhang Lu, and the result was a quick success. Otherwise, if this confrontational situation continued, no one could estimate how the development of the Wei, Jin, and even later history would have been.</p>
<p>Even in terms of military strength, Cao Cao's ability to defeat Zhang Lu, even the orthodox literati of the dynasty, admitted that this was a stroke of good luck, "Heaven blessed Great Wei, and Lu's defense collapsed on its own." Dong Zhao's memorial in the Records of Famous Ministers of Wei contains a good confession: "Emperor Wu listened to the words of the surrendered people, saying that Zhang Lu was easy to attack. He believed it to be true, and when he went there in person, it was not as he had heard. He sighed and said, 'Other people's deliberations rarely meet my expectations.' Attacking the camps on Yangping Mountain, he was unable to take them in time, and the soldiers suffered casualties every day. Emperor Wu was discouraged and wanted to withdraw his troops. Then the advance army got lost at night and mistakenly entered the enemy camp, and the thieves retreated and dispersed. He still did not believe it. Xiahou Dun went forward to see it for himself and reported back, and Emperor Wu advanced his troops to pacify it. Fortunately, he succeeded." Thus, it can be seen that even Cao Cao, who was good at using troops, had to feel a headache when he encountered these "militia uncles," so victory was only obtained by chance.</p>
<p>However, this is not the reason for Zhang Lu's failure. The reason why the "rice thieves'" morale was so scattered should mainly be that their leaders had no confidence in their own cause and did not fight thoroughly. The Biography of Zhang Lu by Chen Shou says: "When the people found a royal seal in the ground, the subordinates wanted to honor Lu as king. Yan Pu advised: 'Hanzhong is surrounded by dangerous terrain. If you support the emperor, you will be Marquis Huan. If you are second best, you will not lose wealth and honor. I wish you would not claim the title for now, and not be the first to cause trouble.' Lu followed his advice.... When Emperor Taizu (Cao Cao)征之, Lu wanted to surrender Hanzhong, but his younger brother Wei refused and led tens of thousands of people to defend the pass." ... Emperor Taizu sent people to comfort and persuade Lu, because he had good intentions, and appointed Lu as General Who Pacifies the South." From here, we can know even more that the defeat of the "rice thieves" was not due to Cao Cao's conquest, but to Zhang Lu's betrayal. Of course, when the will and determination of a leader are so unsteady, on the one hand, he maintains the idea of recognizing the orthodox first, and on the other hand, he attempts to sell himself and surrender, the will to resist the enemy is not active, and internal strife is easy to occur. Once oppressed by the other side, he will naturally be defeated quickly.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua Before Marriage</h3>
<p>— Cai Xue</p>
<p>The life of Sai Jinhua has been described in great detail, with Fan Fanshan's Before and After Rainbow Clouds Songs, Zeng Mengpu's Flower in a Sinful Sea, and Liu Minong's biography of her in her old age. However, they all record her affairs after marrying Hong Jun. It is not known that before marrying Zhu, Li Shichang also wanted to take her as a concubine. Li Shichang was originally a Nian thief, and he降淸rebelled again. Zeng Guofan奏參him, stripped him of his title as Admiral, and secretly went to Suzhou to indulge in pleasure. He first recruited Caiyun's elder sister, Chaoyun. Chaoyun was afraid and dared not go, so she was replaced by Caiyun. Caiyun was still young at the time, and thought she could be safe. Unexpectedly, Li fell in love with her at first sight, and immediately took out gold and pearls as betrothal gifts, and made an appointment to come and meet her. Caiyun refused, and he was angry, his power was overwhelming and incomprehensible. After he left, the family was frightened and had no way to deal with it. At that time, someone offered a plan and said, "This is Li Shizhong, and it will be inevitable for him to come. Why not move to avoid him?" So they moved into a remote alley without anyone noticing, and left an old woman to guard the mansion. Not long after, Li came back, and he紫彩云was very urgent. The old woman said, "She has already moved." Asked where she moved to. She said, "I don't know." Li大咆哮, but he had no way to deal with it, and he never came again. At that time, he had been革职, and his arrogance had been slightly curbed. Later, in Anhui, he was killed by the Qing governor Yulu, so彩　had no future troubles.</p>

<p>Science Snippets</p>
<h3>Lingzhi (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>Orchids are "auspicious objects," but Lingzhi (a type of mushroom) is an authentic domestic "auspicious herb." Its status as an auspicious herb is likely related to the apocryphal texts of the Han Dynasty. Books like the "Apocrypha of the Classic of Filial Piety" say, "When virtue reaches plants and trees, Lingzhi grass grows; when the elderly are well cared for, Lingzhi grass flourishes." In the second year of Emperor Wu of Han's Yuanfeng era, "Lingzhi grew in the Ganquan Palace, with nine stalks and connected leaves." Therefore, a general amnesty was declared throughout the empire, and the Song of the Lingzhi Chamber was composed, ending with the lines: "Spreading and flourishing day by day, Lingzhi becomes spiritual brilliance." Thus, this ordinary plant, originally called "zhi" or "zhicao," firmly established its identity as "Lingzhi."</p>
<p>Moreover, because it became "Lingzhi," various miraculous legends were attached to it. For example, the Shennong Ben Cao Jing (Divine Farmer's Materia Medica) mentions five types of Lingzhi: "Red ones like coral, white ones like cut fat, black ones like lacquer, green ones like kingfisher feathers, and yellow ones like purple gold." It also speaks of six types of Lingzhi: "Green Lingzhi grows on Mount Tai, red Lingzhi grows on Mount Huo, yellow Lingzhi grows on Mount Song, white Lingzhi grows on Mount Hua, black Lingzhi grows on Mount Chang, and purple Lingzhi grows in the valleys of Mount Gaoxia, all harvested on the eighth day of the sixth month." As for Ge Hong's Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), it says, "There are stone Lingzhi, wood Lingzhi, grass Lingzhi, flesh Lingzhi, and fungus Lingzhi, each with about a hundred types," which are patently absurd and unbelievable.</p>
<p>Since the record of Lingzhi growing in Emperor Wu of Han's palace, similar accounts have appeared endlessly in historical records: In the spring of the seventeenth year of Emperor Ming of Han's Yongping era, Lingzhi grew in the front hall. In the fourth month of the first year of Emperor Huan of Han's Jianhe era, Lingzhi grass grew in the central Huangcang Palace. In the third month of the seventh year of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Tianbao era, jade Lingzhi grew on the pillars of the Datong Hall, with divine light illuminating the hall. In the seventh month of the second year of Emperor Suzong's Shangyuan era, king Lingzhi grew on the beam of the throne in the Yanying Hall, with one stalk and three leaves, and the Emperor composed the Poem of Jade Lingzhi. These were all recognized as auspicious omens and were solemnly recorded by the court historians. Ancient and Modern Poetry Talks says: "During the Xuanhe era, Wang Jiangming was granted a residence, and he reported the growth of Lingzhi grass on the beams. The Emperor visited, coinciding with a long period of plum rains, which moistened the Lingzhi's cultivated soil. An anonymous person in the capital wrote a seventeen-character poem: 'The new duke's newly granted residence, Lingzhi grass grows on the beams, why does it fall down? Little glue.'" This clearly shows that many historical records are unreliable. Furthermore, Duan Chengshi's Youyang Zazu (Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang) says, "If Lingzhi grows for no reason on a house pillar, white signifies mourning, red signifies blood, black signifies thieves, and yellow signifies joy. If its shape resembles a human face, it signifies loss of wealth; if it resembles cattle or horses, it signifies distant labor; if it resembles turtles or snakes, it signifies depletion of fields and silkworms." This further dampens the hopes of those who wish to find Lingzhi in their homes.</p>
<p>However, in society, it is better to compliment people than to curse them. Especially in China, who dares to say no to the Emperor? Thus, Lingzhi has always maintained its status as an auspicious object, and successive generations of flatterers have treated it as a treasure to be offered. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty probably had a particular fondness for Lingzhi. From the second year of Xianping (999 AD) to the first year of Qianxing (1022 AD), nearly every year in the Wuxing Zhi (Treatise on the Five Elements) of the History of the Song Dynasty has records about Lingzhi. For example, in the first year of Dazhong Xiangfu (1008 AD), Wang Qinruo presented 8,139 stalks of Lingzhi grass in the eighth month; Zhao Anren presented 8,711 stalks of five-colored gold jade purple Lingzhi in the ninth month; and Qinruo and others presented 38,050 stalks of Mount Tai Lingzhi grass in the tenth month. In the sixth year, in the tenth month, "Ding Wei came to court and presented 37,108 stalks of Lingzhi grass, decorated with images of immortal beings, precious birds, and exotic beasts. In the eleventh month, he presented another 95,100 stalks. The following year, when the Emperor arrived at Zhenyuan, the people who came to offer them numbered 18,000 stalks." Such a large-scale collection was truly unprecedented and unrepeatable.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Jiazhou Six Records: Suzi Tower and the Great Buddha Temple</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>From Wuyou Temple to the Great Buddha Temple, one can first visit Suzi Tower. It is said that this is where Su Dongpo, a songwriter and prose writer of the Song Dynasty, once studied. Dongpo was from Meishan near here, and if the biographies about him written by later generations are not nonsense, then it is absolutely possible for someone like him to study in this place for a period of time. Therefore, I do not doubt that this historical site is fabricated. Descending the mountain in a winding path, we called a small boat to cross a small stream, then climbed up the earthen slope from the beach, turned to a terrain similar to a valley, walked up the stone steps between the bushes, and after several unavoidable turns, we found the gate with the two characters "Suzi Tower" written on it. After all, for most people, the charming power of poetry is not as great as the charming power of mythology; therefore, this gate is much poorer than the gate of Wuyou Temple.</p>
<p>Passing through this small school-style gate and crossing a slightly repaired courtyard, we came to what seemed to be a dilapidated and dangerous building, which was "Suzi Tower." Leaning on the narrow wooden handrail and walking up, we climbed to the upper floor. In the open small room and the dilapidated shrine, there were statues of Dongpo and his younger brother, with rosy cheeks and blue clothes, holding scrolls in their hands, looking like professors, with sparse beards and simple turbans, quite in the spirit of lecturing people. But not many people came to visit this floor. Besides my friend, there were only three female students eating peanuts here for a while. This floor is exposed to wind and rain on three sides, and the walls on one side are full of doggerel poems. At this time, the sun had already broken through the clouds and shone on the flowers and trees in the courtyard below, making people aware that the late autumn season had arrived.</p>
<p>The woman and children squeezed up to the floor. I knew that they did not have Dongpo in their minds, but came here to join in the fun. Orange peels and peanut shells became sacrifices to Dongpo. There was really no elegance to be found here. We walked down the handrail again to see the hall that we had not paid attention to just now. The hall also enshrined statues with the same spirit. On the left side of the altar, there was a Kui Xing (god of literature) with his leg raised. Kui Xing is a "god of literature," and Dongpo is a "literary man." Putting them together in a hall and calling it "Suzi Tower" allows one to imagine the character of the person who designed this temple and his intentions.</p>
<p>Suzi Tower has nothing to do with Su Dongpo, just as Dongpo has nothing to do with tourists. Without any feelings, I felt that the same boredom existed in ancient and modern times, and it was necessary to have tea to quench my thirst.</p>
<p>Leaving Suzi Tower, we sat in the tea garden on the mountaintop. This tea garden is right next to the hair of the Great Buddha. A snow-white dome-like roof, like that of a mosque, is the top of the Buddha's head protruding from the mountain. Walking to the stone railing, you can see the head of the Great Buddha. This head is standing in the stone gap between the two mountains. The ears, with earholes large enough for one person to stand in, are the most clearly visible part. Looking down from the head, the Buddha's body looks like a stone wall slightly shaped like a human figure, inserted directly into the river in the depression between the two mountains.</p>
<p>According to the inscriptions of the Great Buddha Temple, the Buddha is thirty-six zhang (approximately 118 meters) tall, with eyes two zhang wide and a head circumference of ten zhang, which gives an idea of its height. Facing the confluence of the Dadu River and the Min River, he stands proudly with the generosity that allows you to rush towards him without getting angry. The river under his feet is obviously frighteningly deep. If the boat capsizes, it will probably be impossible to rescue anyone. According to the inscriptions, this Buddha was started by a monk in the Tang Dynasty who solicited donations for its construction. It took almost half a dynasty to complete the project. Because the rapids here often overturned ferries, making it a dangerous place to navigate, the monk made such a great design here, relying on the protection of the Buddha to allow boats to travel safely from then on. This statement is, of course, an article by a religious person; he studied the causes of the eternal between the shape of the mountain and the water momentum and found a method of remedy, specially rushing the rapids of the mountain base, opening a large flame gap, letting the water rush here to soften its power, and then using an idol to strengthen people's courage. Therefore, his labor and effect have been preserved to this day.</p>
<p>This Buddha is entirely made of stone, and it can also be said that a large cave was carved out of the stone mountain, and the final protruding part was sculpted into a Buddha. At that time, without machines and explosives, it is unknown how much manpower it took to complete this great project. Thinking of this, the spirit of the real Chinese people of the Han and Tang dynasties was active in front of me. Sitting in the restaurant with many people, we have become so anxious and afraid to think about or talk about national affairs, aren't we ashamed?</p>
<p>Going around the back of the stone Buddha, we admired the Great Buddha Temple. The front part of this temple is more quaint than Wuyou Temple, but the back has a Western-style Dharma hall, which seems to be a recently built scripture library. In the more remote place behind, we wanted to buy some rubbings of inscriptions here. We walked into the reception hall on the left side of the main hall, where there was a monk of about thirty years old. He seemed to be on duty, but he was not willing to sincerely entertain guests. He seemed to have a neurotic personality, constantly squinting his eyes and reluctantly answering the questions of the guests. When my friend said no, he immediately took them back. This monk who was not good at business was probably just a bookworm who loved to read Buddhist scriptures. We felt that there was no need to sit there any longer. We walked out of the gate through the old path, feeling that even the monks were more incompetent than those of ancient times. Aren't the monks of modern China also modern Chinese people?</p>
<p>The dew had already condensed on the boat, and many tourists had already started to return. However, we were reluctant to leave. We still wanted to accompany this lonely moon, singing some ancient verses on this beautiful and extraordinarily charming lake night...</p>

<h3>Curtain</h3>
<p>— Wang Dai</p>
<p>It seems we regret it somewhat again,</p>
<p>Adding a thin curtain to the wide-open window;</p>
<p>Neither blinds, nor even glass can satisfy us.</p>
<p>Like a poem, we repeatedly delete and revise.</p>
<p>This curtain is truly a grand invention!</p>
<p>This final epigram is indeed somewhat surprising.</p>
<p>It seems to be still derived from imitation.</p>
<p>Don’t you see the cicada cocoon, the spider web, the light mist of dawn?</p>
<p>Transforming sunlight into moonlight, cicada song into autumn insects;</p>
<p>Making the scenery outside the window hazy, the thoughts inside the window serene.</p>
<p>In the midday heat of July,</p>
<p>We seem to be immersed in the spring breeze or autumn air.</p>
<p>It wonderfully complements the window opening,</p>
<p>Like a railing to the meadow, willow branches to the sky.</p>
<p>They exist independently, unconnected, each going its own way;</p>
<p>They are even more mutually compatible in their mutual silence.</p>
<p>Who created intimacy and created separation?</p>
<p>Just like carrying a slight suspicion within deep understanding!</p>
<p>I fear that one day the window will die like a dried-up well,</p>
<p>The curtain torn, and from then on, there will be no secrets whatsoever.</p>
<h3>Boating on a Moonlit Night</h3>
<p>— Pei Yin</p>
<p>Random Notes by the Lakeside</p>
<p>Have you ever been to Hangzhou? Have you ever taken a small boat and, on a cool and moonlit summer night, invited one or two kindred spirits to wander in the heart of the lake? This poetic and beautiful scenery is enough to make people forget the heat and troubles of the day.</p>
<p>There have been some nights when we took a small boat and went to the heart of the lake to seek coolness and fantasy; enjoying this rare beautiful scene. The moon hangs high in the sky, and the night wind blows on the lake surface, rolling up a series of fine silver waves.</p>
<p>The boat was moving slowly, we gently stroked the oars, and softly sang B. D. Ackley’s “Moonlight on the Lake.” From somewhere, the sound of a violin drifted over, so soft, and mixed with the melodious singing of some young men and women. Slowly, that boat full of youth and joy crossed from our left side; vaguely, I saw the shadows of several robust young people on the boat.</p>
<p>Our boat passed through a bridge hole, and everyone suddenly felt a coolness. The sound of the bow of the boat breaking the water was reflected from the bridge wall, making a rustling sound so eerily. On the other side of the bridge, the lake surface was covered with lotus leaves, densely connected into a large area. The boat struggled to row through the gaps between the lotus leaves, and the sides of the boat constantly brushed against the lotus stalks. The lotus flowers were in full bloom, and the rich fragrance of the flowers floated on the lake surface. Those large flowers swayed in the dim night air. I was actually intoxicated by this strong floral fragrance...</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the lake appeared cooler. The lonely moon hung high in the sky, foolishly watching her shadow cast on the heart of the lake. The mountain colors around were very deep, and some farmers' temples and villas were still flashing sparse lights. Who hasn't fallen asleep at this late hour? ... I couldn't help but fantasize.</p>
<h3>Gazing (Two Chapters)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ye</p>
<p>Tower</p>
<p>A tower stands outside my window. I stand under the window and can see it. It has been standing there for a long time. —</p>
<p>It is old and worn, it is aged; it is dilapidated.</p>
<p>I think: One day, it will suddenly collapse with a bang: ...</p>
<p>No praise. I look at it. I am composing a dirge for it.</p>
<p>This tower, it has experienced I don’t know how much wind and rain, calamity. Even if it had a glorious past; but everything has become a relic. Such a remnant only has loneliness, only has desolation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am praying for the collapse of this tower.</p>
<p>Collapse is the inevitable fate of this tower. Collapse may still be a kind of happiness for this tower.</p>
<p>Mountain</p>
<p>Gazing at the mountain standing outside my window, I become melancholy. I have too many thoughts about this mountain.</p>
<p>Children fly kites on the mountain, villagers go to the mountain to graze cattle and sheep, and cut firewood, and I have been a frequent visitor to this mountain since I was a child, and I can find traces of my childhood footsteps everywhere.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese devils raised their adhesive plaster flag on this mountain, it has been occupied as a military forbidden zone, and no one is allowed to approach it even one step.</p>
<p>What about now? What about now that the Japanese devils have been driven away?</p>
<p>Now, it is still not a peaceful era:</p>
<p>The children do not come to fly kites, the villagers have no sheep to graze, and they do not come to cut firewood anymore, and I, who have returned from the distant south not long ago, am about to go to another distant place.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Finished, Chief Secretary." The Big Fool then performed a sweeping salute, reached into his pocket and took out a note, handed it over; then turned around and placed the package in his hand on another desk, turned his back to us, made a face at Little Tiger, and made a gesture. He thought I was looking at the note, and didn't notice his actions. In fact, I understood the note as soon as I saw it, and at this time I had already moved my eyes to see what food he had brought. Judging from his secretive actions, I could guess that those things, although not exquisite, were probably not bad, and there were quite a few; because he and Little Tiger, one big and one small, happened to be a pair of foodies.</p>
<p>"Chief Secretary, reporting back," the Big Fool then remembered that there was also a report; "The secret telegrams have all been sent. There was a phone call from Peiping at the time. Please call back home, Chief Secretary, there is an urgent official matter..." He pointed to the note in my hand, "That was received by Clerk Liu, at six twenty-five in the morning. …"</p>
<p>"Anything else?" I knew that most of his thoughts were pinned on that package of food; absent-minded, he might drop one or two pieces of news; so I reminded him a little.</p>
<p>"There is... yes... Longhu Terrace has already made contact, a small contact, only rifles and light machine guns, a trial of strength. It only lasted for an hour. The Chinese garrison replaced the Japanese devils on this side with a beating, and there were quite a few casualties on the Japanese side..."</p>
<p>"Anything else?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"... They have now deployed large formations of aircraft, fifty field guns, and two large squadrons of cavalry here; at six o'clock in the afternoon, they are preparing to attack the Chinese garrison on the left and right flanks... The Chinese side has equipment that is too old."</p>
<p>"Anything else...?" I tentatively asked again.</p>
<p>"... Before leaving, I tidied up the 'gear' and told Little Liu and Second Monk, Second Monk's woman to take turns guarding it in two shifts. - Second Monk and his woman both said that someone was paying attention to our 'establishment'; Little Liu didn't sleep all night, afraid of trouble, so..." The so-called "gear" refers to the radio transmitter.</p>
<p>"That's very well handled." The Big Fool handled this move well; "'Carefulness is never wrong' is a common saying," I couldn't help but praise him. "No more words, then?" I thought the Big Fool's report should be over. As for someone paying attention, it was Du Erxian and his wife being nervous; I believed that since we had appeared as "Number Fifteen," ordinary Japanese special agents would never pay attention. If someone was paying attention, it must be a high-ranking member of the Pine Group, they are elusive and ruthless. If there was any action, Du Er would not notice. So I did not follow up.</p>
<p>"There's one more thing!" The Big Fool stammered a little; "It can't be someone from inside us..."</p>
<h3>Song of the Seashore</h3>
<p>— Lu Hai</p>
<p>Fishing Boat</p>
<p>On the clear blue sea, white sails are floating vaguely, the sun has just risen, and the early-rising fishing boats have already sailed far away with the wind.</p>
<p>Living on this coast, gazing at the departing fishing boats all day long, do I silently think about the wind and waves of the future?</p>
<p>Happy residents of the seaside country, will you also have the impurities of the mortal world on the fishing boat?</p>
<p>Envy those people who live on the sea, they are so free, you see, every day, they sail their own boats, turning in any direction they please.</p>
<p>Beach</p>
<p>Who used "planting an ideal flower on the beach" to compare it to an impossible hope?</p>
<p>Today, living by the sea, I actually saw the flowers on the beach? I exclaimed in surprise:</p>
<p>"Come and see! Flowers also grow on the beach!"</p>
<p>It spreads in the gaps between the sand and rocks, with round leaves and white flowers, but I don't know what it's called.</p>
<p>Dusk</p>
<p>Every dusk, I stroll along the silent beach. The sea at dusk is so attractive, the setting sun emits colorful brilliance.</p>
<p>Red clouds; purple clouds, yellow clouds, set off on the blue head of the sea, like a colored plate, smearing the blue waves, what a beautiful dusk! If it is said that color intoxicates people, this dusk sea is enough for you to love.</p>
<p>Stars</p>
<p>Now, in the season of midsummer, every night I lie by the window, quietly whistling, the sound contains the streamer of my mood.</p>
<p>I love to watch the stars, the stars on this midsummer night are so comfortable to look at! Especially at the junction of the sea and the sky, the silver light of the stars is reflected on the sea waves, I wonder if it is the starlight of Bethlehem?</p>
<p>Star girl, how lively you are! You are always mischievously blinking your eyes, I really want to transform into the night wind and travel with you. (July 9th, Qingdao)</p>
