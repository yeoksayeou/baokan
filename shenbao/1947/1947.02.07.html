<p>〔本報濟南六日電〕國軍霍守義部，自四日收復萊蕪城後，向城南及兩側退竄共軍，於五日起復回師自三面向城郊反撲，迄晚仍戰鬥中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕龍海路小壩柳河等地，連日激戰。六日共軍已全崩潰，正向商邱西北退却，並於路樓一帶整理，似有　犯商邱模樣。豫南鐵路以南，共軍頗有調動，惟尙無顯著前進跡象。魯南萊蕪以東之顔莊，於六日收復，共軍向莢蕪之蒙陰撤走。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州六日電〕共軍第七九兩師約三萬餘人，四日竄抵臨城北　里之官橋，杜圩子一帶，揚言進攻臨城。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠六日電〕據空軍偵察，臺縣城內有少數共軍，擬運物資北去，部隊多駐四鄉。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州五日電〕共軍掦勇部四五千人，四日夜攻陷碭山東北卅果之周　。又三日晨陷毫縣之共軍劉伯誠部萬餘人，五日繼續向東流竄，圖犯夏邑。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕行　參謀長王子鳴，頃與記者談中原戰局謂：鄭州防守鞏固，外傳開封失守說亦屬無稽。就目前情況判斷，共軍　攻徐州，絕難得逞。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南六日電〕濟南外園因國軍援兵趕到，分配齊河，晏城，形勢穩固無虞，五日夜十一時迄六日拂曉，共軍進攻齊河西北城郊，經一夜激戰，卒將共軍擊退，共軍主力解七及解十一兩師，近在濟南外團集結，揚言舊正月底攻濟南，但近日已大都不見，據悉已開魯南參戰，攻濟說係　張聲勢。</p>
<h3>魯南完成綏靖工作　國軍三路即將會師</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京六日電〕國軍刻分三路直入臨沂，魯南決戰已迫在眉睫，由國軍精銳部隊所組成之南路進攻部隊，傳已越過李家莊，其先頭部隊已抵臨沂南面六哩之西白林莊，由郝　舉率領之東路進攻部隊，業已渡過沂河，與南路部隊會師，北路沿膠濟鐵路南下之王耀武部隊進展甚速，頃已攻下萊無。臨沂共軍鑒於國軍迫切之故，已加速自城區撤退，傳在臨沂三哩外之先頭部隊，刻已　見，城中之大火及爆炸聲。</p>

<h3>社論　從美商控訴說起</h3>
<p>自本月二日以來，美國通訊社一再傳出在華美商向國務院控訴其在華經商遭遇排擠並受差別待遇的消息；接着美國國務院發言人正式表示，美國當局對於在華美商所提出的控訴，己在玫慮之中，同時美國駐華大使館也已予以密切注視。本埠字林西報一昨發表社論，也謂在華外商遭受排擠與歧視，豈祗美商而已，其他國家之在華商人，對於目前中國貿易政策的傾向，也同樣深感不安。我們對於這一個問題，認爲不僅有關於中國的對外貿易，而且對於中國的金融經濟，也有莫大的影響，自不能不予以澄淸，從而消釋各國在華商人的疑懼，以正國際的視聽。</p>
<p>我們對於美國致力於恢復戰後國際貿易自由，在原則上自不能反對；但是我國係經濟落後的國家，一切產業尙談不上工業化；爲了發展本國的工業，不能不採取所謂「適度的保護」辦法。因爲經濟落後的國家，根本不能與經濟發達的國家，站在平等的地位，如果硬要自由，平等，互惠，互利，則徒然有利於經濟發達的國家。這是我國對外貿易政策的基點。記得聯合國社會經濟理事會於去年十月十五日在倫敦召開國際貿易與就業預備會議時，中國代表金問泗博士，亦曾以此爲言；並盼望與會各國代表，能提出積極性及具體的建議，俾使經濟比較不發達的國家，也能早日完成其工業化之任務。</p>
<p>中國政府於去年十一月十七日公佈修正進出口貿易辦法，就基於這種意義，其具體的辦法有五：（一）一般的管制，對於一切進口貨物，一律採取許可制度；（二）對於不必要的進口貨，予以禁止？（三）對於許可進口的貨物，也採取限額制；（四）對於十分需要的進口貨，許其優先進口；（五）對於經營進口業者，不論其爲官爲商，同等待遇，不分軒輊。所以這一個辦法在其開始實行之時，不但爲全國人民一致擁護，就是各國在華的善良商人，對於中國當局不得不採取這種「適度的保護」辦法的苦衷，也莫不表示同情與諒解，而願竭誠遵守這個辦法，惟自這個辦法實施以來，未及三個月，而美國在華商人，竟紛紛向其政府控訴，本埠字林西報亦稱此爲「一個壞的政策」，使我們不得不引以爲憾。</p>
<p>據合衆社紐約二日電，美國在華商人向國務院控訴的理由，分析言之，約有下述三項：（一）美商駐華代表已不獲領得額定數量以外之貨物進口許可證，而一般半官性質之公司，則利用其政治關係，却仍能領得貨物進口許可證，（二）此種半官性質之公司，利用政治關係及其他壓力，迫令製造商將其代理商號，交其經營；並將美國公司於數月前甚至於數年前所定之生產計劃，悉數加以預定；（三）自去年十一月十七日頒佈修正進出口貿易辦法以來，美商即不獲領得價値五千美元以上貨物之進口許可證，以致爲中國復興所急需之重工業設備，雖定貨迄今已將十八個月，亦無法取得進口許可證。</p>
<p>我們對於在華美商的控訴，即使在尙未査明屬實之前，也就應該抱着「有則改之無則勉之」的態度，首先作一個自我檢討，有無美商控訴所說的事責？因爲美國所提出的事實，就是以我國政府所頒佈的修正進出口貿易辦法來權衡，也是一種令人痛心的違法行爲，政府當負有澈査與糾正的責任！官商同等特遇，在辦法之中不是有明文規定的嗎？不過我們也不得不向美國以及其他各國在華商人指出，美商向其政府控訴的理由，即使査明屬實，也僅是主管機關的處理不善，而非修正進出口貿易辦法的不合理，這一點不可不分淸。</p>
<p>所以我們站在人民的立塲，對於這個問題的態度，說來很簡單：一方面希望中國政府，實施修正進出口貿易辦法，應力求公平，尤其對於政府所經營或管理之工商機關，不能予以任何優待，一切手續都應該與民營的工商機關相同，務使其機會均等，自由競爭，以免引起後者的不平，所謂「不平則鳴」，美商的向其政府控訴。絕非毫無根據。同時我們還希望在華外商，應該放大眼光，先認淸中國目前最急需的貨物，然後即以中國急需的貨物進口，切勿只知貪圖眼前的利益，而將中國國計民生所需，置之不顧。我們要外國商人明瞭；對華貿易的前途，完全建築在中國國內的繁榮上；如若只知來華貿利，而不知培養中國人民的購買力，則對華貿易甚少有光明的前途。老實說，外商在華貿易的危機，不在其遭受排擠與歧視；而在外貨傾銷使中國民窮財盡，最値得憂慮。希望所有各國的在華商人，均能玫慮及此。</p>

<h3>湘桂災情慘重　桂林幾成死市</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕中央社記者自上月卅日乘機南行，曾赴廣州，柳州，桂林三地訪問，戰後華南，已非昔日可比。一年半以來，因經濟困難影響，市面已無戰前繁榮，尤以柳桂二地為最，至今仍未復員十之二三。柳州因有水路交通，情况較好，商業稍有往來，桂林則因交通失去聯絡，幾成死市。廣西災民分散四鄕，最近因有行總之救濟，勉渡難關，然有僧多粥少之感，僉信今年春二月靑黃不接時期，可能再演大　　慘劇。湘桂二省災情最重，吾人更未可予以忽視。廣州方面，自歐陽駒市長接任以來，每月收支頗能相抵，最近復向四行籌借一百億元，作為築修道路之用，現已積極開工。</p>

<p>美救濟計劃對我殊不利</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕聯合國救濟總署方面本月吿本社記者稱：若千中國官員認爲在美國主持之歐洲糧食救濟計劃下，中國已成爲主要之犧牲者。該計劃將於本週杪由聯總署長魯克斯予以宣布，擬撥款三千五百萬美元作爲聯總結束後救濟歐洲糧食之用。全部款項係由聯總存款四百萬美元，捷克分配款項內所提出之六百萬元，及其他各國「用不掉款項」由二千五百萬美元所拼成。中國名下之一千五百萬美元亦在「用不掉款項」之內。因此在六月底結束前之救濟中國款項內，勢將减少一千五百萬美元。據稱：聯總中央委員會對此必將引起激烈爭執，故此項計劃難有通過之望云。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統本日再度主張變更關於總統繼任問題之現行法律，以便更能「符合民治政府之基本觀念」。總統以同樣之函件，分致參院主席范登堡及衆院議長馬丁，重申一九四五年六月間向國會所提之建議：即已被選出之總統與副總統如遇死亡，則衆院議長應爲第一繼任人。其時如無議長，或雖在議長而不合資格，則由參院主席暫時代理總統，直至合格之衆院議長選出爲止。杜魯門總統最初提出此項建議後，不久衆院即通過此種規定之議案，但在參院中未能通過。</p>

<h3>蘇軍總司令部頒佈　戰後第五次復員令</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科五日電〕蘇聯總司令部今日頒佈戰後第五次復員令，此乃蘇聯回復平時生活及供給農工業人力之又一步驟。新復員令於本年三月至六月間生效，復員人數似較上一决爲多。蘇聯原如其他國家，曾使年事較高之軍人復員，而徵召年青者入伍。但現有種種明顯跡象，證實大批蘇聯軍役年齡靑年，戰後迄未被徵入伍，反而加入工廠工作，或從事民間專門工作。此次復員後，蘇聯尙餘幾多軍隊，殊難斷言。史達林總理曾於去年十月宣稱蘇聯在國外駐軍六十師。並稱第四次復員後，歐洲方面駐軍將减至四十師。比數並不包括國內復員人數及東方駐軍人數在內。預料國際局勢倘若平靜，則此次復員令尙非最後一次，因復員非但爲蘇聯願望，且爲迫切需要。</p>

<h3>蘇聯掌握下的波蘭</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室譯</p>
<p>最近美國務院發表正式聲明，譴責波蘭臨時政府，認爲波蘭最近所舉行的普選，未能依照雅爾達與波茨坦協定的保證，符合民主自由的精神。目前的波蘭政府，主要的是在蘇聯的掌握之下的。蘇波間的關係究竟如何？在這篇「倫敦泰晤士報週刊」的華沙通訊裏，有極客覜的報導。</p>
<p>上次聯合國大會開會時，葛羅米柯提出要調査各國在海外的駐軍，如果調査，則蘇聯紅軍在波蘭究竟有多少數目，自亦應在調査之列了。戰爭結束不久，波蘭軍隊中的蘇聯軍官數目極多，現在則已逐漸减少。據波蘭國防部長兼陸軍總司令羅拉柴米斯　的報吿，自一九四五年六月以後，彼蘭軍隊中的蘇聯軍官陸續撤退返國者，已有一萬四千餘人，其中四十人爲將官級。目前，波蘭軍官在莫斯科和華沙受蘇方訓練的，爲數仍舊頗多。留存在波蘭軍隊裏的蘇聯軍官報穿着波蘭的制服，事實上，其中很多祖籍就是波蘭。</p>
<p>海港機塲</p>
<p>海港方面，名義上雖已交還波蘭，但有許多重要據點，仍在蘇軍之手，而機塲方面，則大部分是在蘇軍的掌握之下。搭乘民航機的旅客，只能够守在候機室裏，不能越雷池一步·波蘭官方承認，因爲飛機和飛行人員缺乏，波蘭軍用和民用航空人員的訓練，不得不全仰仗蘇聯。而彼蘭目前所用的飛機，也大都是蘇聯所造的。</p>
<p>內政外交</p>
<p>在這種情形下，彼蘭在內政和外交上自然都帶着了極濃重的蘇聯影響。在外交方面，波闌在一切外交集會中都是惟蘇聯的馬首是瞻，其政府中主要的外交政策決定者，即外交次長摩茲里斯基，和國務决長貝爾門，都是極端的共產主義者，一切當然是追踪莫洛托夫和維辛斯基的。</p>
<p>在內政上，最顯著的一點就是秘密警察的制度。在波蘭，我們時常聽見人有攻擊說，蘇聯軍官操縱着秘密警察署，而署長雷特維茲則根本是個俄國人。這種攻擊是不大有根據的，因爲事實上，蘇聯軍官和波蘭秘密警察署並沒有什麽關係。不過有一點是很顯然的，那就是：這種獨立的秘密警察制度力是從俄國人那裏抄　去的。</p>
<p>在純內政事務上，蘇聯倒並沒有千涉什麽。譬如說，學校中並不宣揚馬克斯主義，而外國語的選讀，也俄語和英語都可隨便，並不强迫。鐵路，郵局，電信等機構都由波蘭人自己管理，蘇聯人並不參加。</p>
<p>蘇方活動</p>
<p>在波蘭的蘇聯使館人員和軍事代表等大都十分謹慎小心，深居簡出，不大和外界多接觸，即使是在波蘭的蘇聯記者，也是如此。但另一方面，文化上的活動則十分鎭繁，蘇聯影片到處有映，蘇聯書籍到處有售。在波蘭的紅軍，自己也辦了一張報，叫做「自由日報」，在華沙銷行甚廣，其主要的目標是宣揚蘇聯國力的强大。</p>
<p>蘇軍的漸决從波蘭撤退，原因是爲了避免刺激波蘭人的感情。一般的波蘭人對於蘇聯是並無好感的，由於數百年來的歷史關係，哥薩克和沙皇殘暴的記憶尙未消除。同時，波蘭人還自己以爲是「西方」種，對於「東方」種的俄國人有點不大看得起。紅軍軍官到波蘭的酒吧間去，侍者對他們的態度是頗爲冷淡的。</p>
<p>波人態度</p>
<p>波蘭人對於蘇聯的態度，大約可分爲三類：第一類是竭力親蘇的，政府首長及政府派的人皆屬此類。他們認爲波蘭必須和蘇聯緊堅聯結一氣，如此方對波蘭有利。第二類是承認需要和蘇聯聯合起來，但不覺得這是波蘭之福。一般說來，中產階級，自由職業份子，及高等農民皆屬此類。他們擁護大斯拉夫主義，但不贊成蘇聯的那一套經濟制度。第三類是死命反對蘇聯的，這類人包括工業家，被剝奪了田地的地主們，傳敎師，和一些隱藏在森林裏的武力反對者。此外，還有一批流亡在外的波蘭人也是竭力反對現在的臨時政府的。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於這塊地方，一方面是攫住不放，一方面是頻送秋波，以作爲自己西方的屛障。</p>
<h3>美國八年內飛機失事的　一篇流水賬　罹難者逾四百四十人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕自一九三九年起至一九四六年止，美國定期航空失事死亡率，的計每飛行三百四十六萬六千七百五十五哩死乘客一人，每一千三百四十五萬二千二百哩死機員一人，此係根據民用航空部保安局及民用航空管理局飛航失事紀錄之死亡統計。美國民用航空雖始於一九三〇年，但無詳細報吿，自一九三八年民用航空法案成立後，國內航空運輸始完成轉入現代時期，故此項統計由一九三九年開始。截至一九四六年止，八年中共有航空公司飛機失事案三十六起，罹難乘客三百五十五人，機員九十人。平均每航行五千二百十二萬〇五百五十「乘客哩」死乘客一人．（一架飛機飛行一哩爲一「飛機哩」，一個乘客航行一　爲一「乘客哩」。如一機載客四十四人，飛行一百哩，其紀錄即爲一百「飛機哩」與四千四百「乘客哩」。自一九三〇年至一九三八年之乘客哩與飛機哩，紀錄不詳，但知共有乘客二百率五人及機員一百零九人罹難）。由每一失事案件中之平均死亡數，可見商業航空飛機設計之變遷。自一九三〇至一九三八年間，每一飛機失事，平均死乘客二·七五人，機員一·四五人。自一九三九年至一九四六年間，因飛機體積增大，故每一失事案之平均死亡率，乘客增至八。三三，機員增至二。四三。罹難乘客一次達十人以上之失事案，首見於去年一月，有飛機一架在古狄思墜毁，乘客十四人及機員三人，同時罹難。航空公司雖代表大部份載客旅行，但在全部飛行事業中僅作一小部，其飛機在美國民用飛機中祗佔百分之一。去年除航空公司飛機外，共發生死亡失事案五百起，無死亡失事案六千四百起。特約及包租飛機與不定期航行，共有死亡失事案八起，乘客五十八人及機員二十三人喪生。據定期航空公司報吿，去年計有廿二次失事案並無死亡。</p>

<h3>大火案開啓密告箱　隊長救火帶夫人麻臉女子拿花瓶　兩函準備交由法院澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案之密吿箱，五人調査會主委葛克信，參議會代表張迺作等，於昨晨十時當衆開啓，箱內密吿信僅兩封，拆閱之下，竟謂消防車上載有「消防夫人」，誠屬咄咄怪事另一函則係檢舉居民有趁火打刦之行爲，調査會已準備交法院進行澈査。茲將兩函分錄於後</p>
<p>「宜昌路消防隊到達火災地點時，見救火車上戰米二個女子，敝人當時認爲是女子消防隊員，後據人云乃是消防隊隊長夫人，至令事跡可疑，爲此報吿，請當局澈査該消防隊帶來女子究存何意？一個鄰近孫某。」</p>
<p>「我看見一個女人，三十歲光量，（住武定路　益坊木房內），臉上大麻（曾出天花）。那天晚上，在火塲內拿了一個花瓶，還有許多東西，急急忙忙搬往東走，如是者幾次，我的嬸嬸吿訴我說：這女人是住在謙益坊的，他們從前開柴爿店，嬸嬸常去買柴爿時看見的，可惜嬸嬸叫不出名字來，眞是遺憾。（未具名）」</p>
<p>有人爲兩警證明　帮助搶救</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於一八五〇號及三三五號警察闖入火塲事，調委會曾於昨午分訪長　路警分局長陳志淸，股長能一希超，及巡官蕭佐生等，據稱：警局遇有火災發生時，深恐宵小趁機打刦，每派員警到塲協助維持交通，然活動屬於塲外，非奉命令或特殊事故，不能擅自闖入火塲。是日長寗路分局得報後，曾派六制服警及二便衣警趨火塲協助戒備，然一八五〇號及三三五號兩警則並未在內，直一八五〇號爲巡邏警，三三五號爲値日警，如果在火塲，則根據警務規則顯爲擅離職守。</p>
<p>陳局長稱：若有人證明彼兩警士確會擅入火塲，則非予嚴辦不可，該局除派員赴兩警家中搜査外，並已將被等解押總局督察處査辦。然昨據督察處長張達語記者稱：謂昨日曾有居於六六〇弄三號之楊俊三及殷秉權者，赴總局爲該兩警察作證，稱一八五〇號及三三五號兩警士乃見義勇爲協助彼等搶救財物者，決非「趁火打刦」。至於所謂「衣袋甚爲可擬」，則係彼等噌以解渴之橋子。彼等並稱；當日協助搬運者，除上述兩警士外，尙有七九二號，一八三四號，及一八三三號等，警局以該警等旣入火塲，自須詳加訊間，除前兩者在押外，後三者亦將個別加以傳詢之。</p>
<h3>一個市民竟見書</h3>
<p>又參議會接獲一市民對於武定路大火之意見書，內稱本案中警察工作必有欠缺，囚若有素　　良之警察在塲照料，則消防人員絕不致目無法紀至此。又稱曾有災戶於事後接到恐嚇信，則此信必爲實施參加趁火打刦者所爲，應核對其筆跡等語，現參議會代表張迺作，已將其意見交調査委員會，以供調査及改進之參考資料。</p>
<h3>流言四起誤會日多　潔身自好之消防員皆感灰心　大家準備捲舖蓋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕消防處長周兆祥昨稱：西摩路大火發生後，流言四起，誤會日多，致平素潔身自好者，皆感灰心，工作情緒極爲低落，且多數皆已準備「捲鋪蓋」。本人經此番事件之打擊後，對歷年來工作之信心全失，待本案調査結束，案情大白後，即將引咎辭職。</p>
<p>又虹口分隊區隊長陳潛，參加消防工作已達廿餘年，彼之左頰傷痕斑班，乃十年前灌教揚州路電力公司大火時所灼傷。迄今左眼皮外翻，呈鮮紅色，且嘴腔不能張大，故發音低微。彼昨日情緒甚爲衝動，曾謂記者曰：「我們愛這工作，喜歡這工作，所以數十年來始終不離崗位，但是，現在社會的責難，通得我們不得不離開職守了」。言下不勝感慨。又周兆祥最後聲稱：在下屆參議會中，對於不合建築條件之里弄及攤販等，決請嚴予取締。又對於消防設施方面，若地方人士願意協助辦理，則極表歡迎，並深信改進更速。</p>
<p>據消防處科長謝智庸稱：消防員待遇之過於菲薄，實爲工作效率低落之最大原因。現時彼等之待遇，自十四五萬元起，至二三十萬元不等，個人生活已難維持，　論養家！故現時留在虹口區消防處工塲中工作者，非老即少，年輕力肚者早已改就他業矣。　中央區消防隊中，有大型雲梯車一輛，其雲梯可搖至一五〇呎高，以灌救高層建築物之用。該項車輛，據聞全世界僅四輛，而本市即擁有其二。該車笨重難行，非有經騐者無法駕駛，該項人才，屈指可數，然可憐彼等懷得一身絕技，而一家老小，尙　免有凍餒之處。周處畏昨日曾拉其滿綴補綻之破衣示記者，然後苦笑曰：「將後日子如何度過」？</p>

<h3>工作受辱道歉了事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次西摩路武定路大火案發生後，市民對之頗多怨言，而消防員方面則以各方不無誤解之處，更因輿論界之紛紛　難，表示對工作進行上，蒙受影響甚大。據陳分隊長稱：二月一日上午八時，有新記路二四一號中南製罐廠失火，當救火車聞警趕往施救時，火勢已吿撲滅，唯見屋頂仍冒白烟，當時即斷定餘火尙醞酿於屋頂夾層間，當由消防警三名，　登屋頂企圖掀開瓦片灌救，詎該廠某職員竟出而干涉，阻止救火員登屋，且語多侮辱。後由消防員請其同上屋頂，將正在延燒中之火勢指示，一時消防員羣情激怒，後由該廠蔡經理當面道歉始吿罷休。</p>
<p>又消防處科長　　勇稱：日前新閘路上亦曾發生同樣事件，因現用之皮帶多陳舊不堪，當水龍出水時，突吿破裂，詎在塲旁觀之少年突稱：「這樣一來，又可以講斤頭了」消防員囚不堪侮辱，故待火勢撲滅後，即將其帶回消防處準備送警局詰訊，以明黑白。後爲消防處長周非祥所阻，周處長諭令所屬：「事實即爲最好之明證」不必小題大做」，一塲風波，始吿平息。</p>

<h3>戳傷三輪車夫案　程榮芳撤回告訴其兄突表示異議　能否撤回待調查傷勢</h3>

<p>據地院方面消息，程榮全之確認撤回吿訴無效聲請，係於晨十時送達地院，該項聲請是否可予允准，需視程榮芳簽字時是否被脅迫詐欺所致而定，同時撤回吿訴，亦需調査，須被害人之傷勢確已完全痊愈，始能生效，否則雖被害人本人同意和解，被吿仍應負刑事責任。</p>
<p>據該案之承辦檢察官表示，該案偵査時，被害人係受重傷，故依刑法二百七十七條第二項起訴，係非告訴乃論罪，不能撤回；如被害人傷勢好轉，確已能完全康復，則刑庭方面可變更起訴條文。如確認爲普通傷害罪，則係吿訴乃論，被害人可撤回吿訴。</p>

<h3>緝獲私鹽小舟夜泊　護船鹽警被人扼死　嫌疑犯昨解地檢處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海第一區鹽務辦事處鹽警第四隊下士楊光中，於去歲十二月骨七日率領鹽警數名，至塘灣閘江口等處査緝私鹽，第一日即緝獲私鹽一百三十担四十斤，翌晨又獲三十五担，並小木船一隻。楊即另雇一大船帶同緝獲之小船載運私鹽來滬。因一時缺少船伕，故小船由楊自己划行。途中忽遇一鄕人模樣自稱孫秋全者，自願替楊划船，楊正求之不得，遂放孫入小船，自己返大木船，而另派二等警十姚敦佐在小船上監護。孫秋全划行小船甚慢，似有意落後，其時且風浪極大，孫遂稱小船已無法前進，乃在閘江口窰碼頭停泊渦夜，大船則繼續航行。楊光中返滬後，即覺任小木船停泊江中過夜，不甚妥常，常夜即派人前往尋覓，不料至窰碼頭已不見小船蹤跡，附近鄕民議論紛紛，或謂姚敦佐已開小差，或謂姚已被人謀害，經多方調査，始悉姚敦佐確確已被孫秋全及其友人潘阿根，郭鶴生，李盛洪等四人，以手扼斃，沉屍江心，朋分船中私鹽而逸。孫秋全不久即被警局拘獲，其餘三人在逃。該突昨日解地檢處，檢察官丁同俊提訊孫秋全一過，認爲預謀殺人嫌疑重大，即諭收押。</p>
<h3>軍官戎馬辛勞　愛女險入火坑　街頭巧遇悲喜交集　白璧無瑕欣然同歸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年軍官李俊卿，年卅八歲，天津人，原駐蕪湖，近奉調赴蘇，途經上海，昨日偶作小遊，於八仙橋柳林路竹邨前，忽瞥見弄口站立一女，近視之，竟爲其生女毛毛（年十六歲），詫異之下，追究根由，遂演出極畫人間悲歡之一幕。</p>
<p>緣李君自前年勝利後二月，曾偕女由後方來滬，途經松江時，父女失散，後經四處托友找尋，最後始在蘇州尋獲，然因任務未了，且恐再蹈覆轍，故即將愛女寄養於蘇地挑當巷親戚嬸娘洪氏家中，本久則轉輾各地，軍務繁忙甲，僅賴尺素與女互通音信，如是年餘，因物價不斷高漲，洪氏負担日重，遂於上月廿九日，託鄰居馬太太，偕毛毛來滬，擬轉託滬上親友，代覓職業，以彌補日常開支。</p>
<p>馬太太抵滬之翌日，即將洪氏原意商之與手帕交趙張氏，趙張氏者，本市柳林路竹邨三十九號韓莊之　母也，惟一經介紹，趙氏因見毛毛聰敏伶俐，品貌秀麗，驟生愛憐，願收爲養女，所有生活費亦顯按月滙寄洪氏。而毛毛在滬日期雖暫，經洪氏加以修飾後，已一　而爲摩登少女，惟毛毛頗知自愛，且幸趙張氏亦無野心企圖，故迄今白　未玷，誠屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>昨日上午十時許，毛毛在弄口徘徊，無意中竟巧逢乃父，異地相會，悲喜交集，不禁熱淚盈眶。乃父不知底細，誤爲歹徒拐騙，故至卅九號將趙張氏扭赴泰山警分局，控其妨害家庭罪，旋經偵查，供出前情，然李君尙不置信，堅請警局將其女送請醫院檢騐。警局准其所請，派員陪同毛毛至南洋　院，由李振　女醫師檢騐，結果證明確屬處女，始釋疑團。惟毛毛至此決願隨父同歸，故趙張氏雖愛女如已出，然在此情形下，亦惟有目送彼倆雙雙談笑而去。</p>

<p>葛克信談話</p>
<p>據武定路火災調査委員會主任委員葛克信談稱：調査會各委員經數日努力之結果，獲得物證數件，筆錄强圖表六十餘份，又已送法院審訊之消防員警計五人，受停職査辦之指揮官二人，一切公開，絕無隱袒。今後當局靜俟法院繼續偵訊辦理，則外界所疑慮之「雷聲大雨點小」一節，自可消釋。其餘行政部份仍調查進行中，果有弱點，決不諱疾忌醫，逆料市政府必能與全體市民共謀火政之健全云云。</p>
<p>報告書全文</p>
<p>武定路火災調查委員會第一報吿書全文如次：查三十六年元月廿二日（即農曆正月初一日）晚的九時半，武定路四二五號銅匠作失愼，嗣即蔓延至西鄰陝西北路（即西摩路）六六〇弄二九號東側搭蓋之木屋東鄰武定路四二三號永勤橡膠廠，消防處得警後，即由靜委寺區先行驅車至武定路火塲灌救，時約十時左右；嗣中央·新閘·虹口·宜昌路等各區消防隊相繼出動灌救，的二十分鐘後，四二五號及西鄰二九號之木屋東鄰永勤橡膠廠之火勢漸熄。越的半小時，西鄰六六〇弄廿九號三樓重又燃燒，火勢即不可收拾。嗣即向西蔓延，依次遞燒至陝西北路六六〇弄廿七，廿三，廿一，十五，十一，五，三號共計洋房八幢，均被燒燬，餘燼至廿十三日下午一時始全熄滅。總計延燒達十五小時，輿論譁然，流言四起。經自三十六年元月二十九日起，至二月二日止，五日來査詢被害人四鄰證人，曁是日到塲消防隊負責官長，美軍消防隊等之結果，謹參照所得資料，認定各點事實如左：</p>
<p>二次起火情殊可疑</p>
<p>（一）起火—查首次起火係武定路四五二號銅匠作，嗣延　　陝西北路六六〇弄廿九號東側之木屋後，即經救熄、約越半小時後，該廿九號三樓重又燃燒，經實地履勘，察得該廿九號所搭出之木屋僅至二樓爲止，與廿九號原屋相昆連處之數窗口，均僅燃燒至窗之木框爲止，窗口內部附近，均無燃燒痕跡；是廿九號三樓第二次重又燃燒之火源，似雖臆測。復査王雲甫家（即廿九號）車夫黄阿福（即黄寳貴）曁四鄰所見，參之火塲遺跡，是其第二次之燃燒，顯係曰樓先燒，而後往下蔓延。又據王家奶媽王阿奶所供，當時窗門均係關閉之證言（見筆錄），是其三樓之起火原因，究係外面燒入，抑係內部起火，放滋疑問。</p>
<p>勒索金條查無實據</p>
<p>（二）勒索金條—（一）永勤橡膠部分；査外傳永勤橡膠廠主曾給付金條，因而消防員盡力灌救，得免焚如一節，經査詢該廠主人童克勤童克德兄弟二人曁廠內工人等，均矢口否認；雖此乃片而之詞，無足採信，惟査該廠雖與起火點四二五號毘連，其地位略偏東南，當日風向係自東北往西南，該廠地佔上風，且該廠自有滅火機十餘只，工人等當時施救者有五名，且四二五號平屋於起火後，瞬即坍下，是當時火勢在該一方面蔓延不致甚速，予易撲滅，自在情理之中，自難遽以認定該廠曾賄以金條也。（二）王雲甫部分：査外傳消防員因勒索金條未遂，面致聽令燃燒，此點除被害人自願指認外，殊難論斷，經逐一訊問王家主僕多人，均予否認。</p>
<p>竊取財物無可否認</p>
<p>（三）刦取財物—（一）陝西北路六百六十弄二十九號部分：査王雲甫家外傳被刦金銀財物爲數不貲，經逐一訊問，王雲甫本人曁其媳程素英女王垂琴諸人後，可知王媳之首飾等物，確被焚燬（見程素英筆錄），王女之首飾大部　出，僅大金條三根，尙無着落（見王垂琴筆錢）。（惟此點猶須待火塲發掘後，始能斷定）。王雲甫之銀器等業已尋獲，則上傳事實，自屬未盡可信，惟査王妻房中之三門紅木樹，在事後發現曾被劈，二十七號住戶鄭戴堅曾見有消防員在二十九號後門携熱水瓶二只，往戈登路而去，（見會議紀錄）此中蛛絲馬跡，雖不能斷定其曾刦取何物，然其確有竊取財物之行爲，自屬無可否認。（二）陜西北路六六〇弄二十七號部分：査二十七號內，除已經周企航指認之〇一一號消防警士等四人，於元月二十三日上午，在二十七號內開箱刦取毛巾手帕等物，業由各該消防警士自認不諱，已經警察局扣押，即移送地檢處法辦。尙據周企舫證稱：有銀台面五桌，並於翌晨在天井中發現原盛銀合面之木盒二格，曁二樓懸掛衣服之木衣架六只，是其於常晚火勢未延燒及二十七號前，確有盜取財物之行爲。（三）陜西北路六六〇弄十一，十五號部分：査十一號住戶唐瑞千之女傭王英娟曾稱：「有一消防員曾來劈橱時，火正燒到二十七號時，且曾上樓，禁阻我們上去」等語。査二十七號至十一號，其間隔離洋房三幢，當時是否懦要進入，殊有審究之必要；且其一進門即以斧砍樹，當時火尙未延及，該屋樓上自無危險可言，而遽禁阻家人上樓，其有不法之企圖，灼然可見。又據憲兵二十三團外事組憲兵宋志鵬稱：「曾於十五號內見一消防員正在　橱門，後來問他做什麽？他說沒什麽」。後來見他從橱裏拿出橋子糖菓等物，分與其他諸消防員同吃」。等語。査該消防員等不事灌救，而竟在樹內搬取食物，是其有無開啓其他橱門等竊取物件，自屬深滋疑間。又該號住戶顏澤之曾稱；「於翌日在花園內發見制服一套」等語。參之前開事實，是該進人十五號之消防員，有無刦取財物，不無可疑。</p>
<p>緣何鬥毆頗堪注意</p>
<p>（四）大康里打架—査常晚約一時左右，曾有消防員三四人，初肉陝西北路六六〇弄三十一號車間屋頂互毆；嗣續在武定路大康里內互打，的一刻鐘；此點業由證人薛金安，岳桂森，孫超羣，楊必達等一致陳述，自非虛言。査此時理應協力灌救之不暇，更何應相互鬥毆，設非利害相衝，斷不致此，頗堪注意。</p>
<p>一致指摘救火不力</p>
<p>（五）救火不力—査此次武定路之火災，延燒達十五小時，損燬洋房八幢之多，姑無論其器械設備粗陋至若何程度，教火技術訓練之怎樣幼稚，然其所有在塲之消防警士曁各級官長，未能努力撲救，實乃無法掩蓋之事實。證之王雲甫所云：「不是救火兌觀火」，以及其他各被害人及證人所陳各節，幾無不一致指摘，尤以美軍所稱：「曾見有至少十二人以上，是在袖手旁觀」一語，以及該消防隊員等在武定路四四六號聚興園內喝酒（有酒瓶作證）曁在十一號有調戲奶媽（王英娟之筆錄）等事實爲更具體。</p>
<p>分別擬具竟見</p>
<p>據上結結，除消防行政上技術上之缺點曁應行改進各點，容另文報吿外：上開各點事實，均有涉刑事曁行政上之處分，謹分別擬具意見如后：（一）起火原因部分—擬即將此項資料移送上海地方法院檢察處參考，專案偵查。（二）　案金條部分—擬僅作爲一種報吿資料，以供參試。（三）刧取財物部分—除已扣押之〇一一號等四消防警士，應即移解地檢處法辦外，其於常晚進入二十九號之二四五，七六，九〇，三六〇，二七八，三四八，五五〇，五八六，四〇〇，一八四，九二五，一〇二，十二名消防警，區隊附朱慶瀾周悅寰二人，進入二十七號之七〇，一六四，二消防警，區隊附黄鐘秀三人等，共十七人，擬先行移送地檢處偵訊，文進入十五十一號者，　據中央區隊長徐立人供連曾進內，並曾遇見周悅　李　二隊長，並　科長（見筆錄）外，此外進入該二屋之消防警上號碼，未據報吿，擬飭消防隨査明後，送由地檢處偵訊。（四）大康里打架部分—聞諸消防處周處長言，大康里打架者何人，已査出，擬即請飭令開具名單，一併移送地檢處偵訊。（五）救火不力部分—此點擬請交由警察局澈底詳査不力官長曁警士，予以行政上以最嚴厲之處分。至何人不出力？美軍所稱：舊宜昌路一〇一號警士，可以詢得，此十二人爲何人？又吃酒者何人？此外在塲宮長，自亦難辭其咎。以上所擬，否有當，理合繕具調査報告書連同　卷，一併呈請　核。謹呈市長吳。武定路火災調査委員會主任委員葛克信，委員張達，侯雋人，張適作，潘文珍。</p>

<h3>工務局計劃解決房荒　進行續建平民村　向中信局重提前議借款十萬萬元　特函市參議會請先決定償還方式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工務局以市參議會第一次大會決議「建築各區平民村以安民居」一案，雖曾加以硏究，但終以經費無着，難以進行，特復該會，報吿辦理經過，略稱：「本市目前棚戶，槪估有六萬餘戶之多，欲解決其居住問題，假定分期建造簡樸平民村，第一期一萬棟，若每棟造價二百萬元，即需款二百億元。如此　大經費，決非市府所能負拒。不得已，曾與中央信託局商請將該局四百億元公敎人員住宅費中酌撥一半或一部份用以建造平民村，但該局以四聯德處交辦之公敎人員住宅計劃尙未決定，不能作肯定答覆。近聞該局此項計劃已定，住宅分五積，最廉一種造價爲一千萬元，是則本局所希望該局投資之一辦法，已吿失望。」又稱：「本局對此項平民村之建造，仍在計劃進行，目前可採取之辦法有二項：（一）仍以承兌方式向中央信託局重提前議借款十億元進行第二期平民村建築。（二）請市府提前成立市民村管理委員會，積極審募　築費，交工務局建造第三期或第四期平民村。至於第一項借款，是否由市府分期撥還或由市民村管理委員會償還，而作爲救濟性之　築，或仍於建成後分幢出售，應請參議會先行決定，俾採檡房屋式樣時有所依據。」</p>

<h3>中國僅此一架　小巧袖珍飛機　只要三百餘呎空地　便能安全起飛降落</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕科學日臻發達，人類的交通逐漸在趨向於空中發展。我們可以確定不移的預言：總有這麽一天，空中各式各樣的飛機往來如梭，正像現時地面上的汽車火車一樣。那時候，人人可以有機會自備一架飛機，任意翱翔，朝東夕西，把距離的觀念縮到極短極短。這一種並非幻想的遠景，在航空先進的國家已見其端倪，在中國似乎還近於痴人說夢，但至少我們也已經可以嗅到一點氣息了，何以見得？</p>
<p>讀者當還記得前幾天中航公司一四五號客機在鄂西失事，機中僅存的外籍嬰孩保爾維克，是由公司派一架小型飛機自漢口去鄂西鄕間運來上海的。這一種不一定需要機塲祗須一方稍大的曠地就能降落的小型機，究竟是怎麼樣的一種飛機呢？</p>
<p>它的名稱呌做Piper　Cub，目前在中國據說祗有道一架，是Piper公司的駐華代表泰勒（L.K.Taylor）帶來做樣品的。這是一種單引擎機，機翼在機身的上部，其餘形狀與者通飛機相同。它的長闊高度及性能如下表所示：</p>
<p>長　二十二呎六吋</p>
<p>高　六呎十吋</p>
<p>翼寬　三十五呎五吋半</p>
<p>凈重　一千磅</p>
<p>載重　七百五十磅</p>
<p>儲汕量　三十八加侖</p>
<p>耗油量（正常速度）每小時六加侖半</p>
<p>正常連度　每小時一〇三公里</p>
<p>最高速度　每小時一一五公里</p>
<p>起飛距離　四百八十呎</p>
<p>着陸距離　三百六十呎</p>
<p>機身內部除駕駛者外可坐兩人，駕駛室內的機械絕不像大型飛機那樣複雜，各種度表比汽車內的稍爲多一點，可以一目瞭然，但已包羅齊全，也有無綫電，也有盲目飛行設備。這種飛機在美國據說已爲民問普遍應用，因爲它祗須一方三百米左右長的空地就能升降，而且駕駛極易。泰勒說，任何人經過兩星期的訓練，就能够飛行。在大戰戰期間，美國政附並利用這種小型飛機作爲訓練行員的工具。</p>
<p>泰勒是一位航空專家，來華已有半載，但是他爲推銷Piper　Cub與我國政府的交涉，直到現在還沒有結果。他坦白承認推銷這種飛機固然是營業上的任務，但是他更誠懇表示，的確希望能帮助中國民航事業的發展。他說近來全世界飛機失事的消息雖然頻頻傳聞，但是一般說來航空安全是在日益增進中，現時平均的爲每一乘客飛行八百萬公里始有失事一次。世界各國的航空在日飛猛進，中國如果不急起直追，必將自趨於末路。以現在的數字來此較，美國有飛行員二十五萬人，中國通五百人還不到。美國有近一萬處的機塲，中國眼前所能應用的祗數十處而已。泰勒認爲Piper　Cub介紹到中國來以後，非但能發展民間航空，對於訓練飛行員以備不時之需，亦屬極有用處。</p>
<p>Piper　Cub現値每架祗三千五百元美金，比汽車還便宜。預料一旦政府允予進口之後，中國田野城市的上空，時時可以看到這種小型飛機的蹤跡了</p>

<p>昨日會議，決議要案四起：（一）二月份南運紗布許可事宜，仍照舊辦理。統計數字，棉紗一月份餘額二五七九件，加二月份限額二九六七件，二月份棉紗南運限額爲五五四六件。布疋一月份餘額五七六五二疋，加二月份限額七五六四七疋，二月份布疋南運限額爲一三三二九九疋。又專案辦理之南運紗布，計棉紗一月份餘額四〇〇件，加二月份限額二〇〇〇件，共計二四〇〇件。布疋一月份餘額二四六七九疋，加二月份限額三五〇〇〇疋，共計五九六七九疋。（二）原訂收購各支棉紗最高價格表，支數未全，特再增訂如次：（單位千元）八支一一八四元，十二支一四九六元，十四支一六一六元，廿支雙股二〇八二元，廿一支半二〇九八元，廿二支二一四五元，廿六支二四六二元，卅三支三〇〇三元，卅支三股三〇四八元，四十支雙股四〇一八元，六十支五六九一元，八十支七九三七元，八十四支八三三四元。以上各支紗價格，仍係按廿支紗一百九十七萬五千元之比例推算而得。（三）收購棉紗價格中所定之打包標準，以機器大包者爲限，茲各廠亦有以草包打包者而機器大包之工料費每件需二五八四〇元，草包之工料費每件僅九三一〇元。故以後草包打包者，每件之收購價，應照扣差額一六五三〇元。（四）近以物價騰漲，生產成本增加，原訂收購價格，已有不敷，決予調整。調整成數，先由六區棉紡公會評價小組會硏究，待決定成數後，再交由紡管會商決。（按該評價小組會委員，包括吳味經，蔣迪先，劉靖基，　潤夫，程　　等五人）。</p>

<h3>烟煤猛升疾退</h3>
<p>公會申購配煤已核准</p>
<p>煤市烟煤初開，同業前向客戶拋空者，依然抬價競補，是以市價繼續向榮，開平火車節塊最高成交價達八十五萬元高峯，開平一號　達七十五萬元，嗣因市價過高，大戶吐售，公會方面亦獲得申購配煤核准消息，計代配各民營工廠用煤二萬噸，麵粉廠業首批業已配出，同業配售煤八千噸，內二千噸係白煤，六千噸係烟煤。致買戶觀望不前，市况乃急轉萬下，市價步步回降，開平火車篩塊八十萬元，開平一號屑六十八萬元，均無人問津，白煤國產到貨極少，洋煤因外匯及輪入限制，辦本高，到貨亦不多，市勢依然堅俏。</p>
<h3>新金鑛　在非洲發見</h3>
<p>〔路透社非洲達里薩蘭五日電〕據坦噶尼加踏勘礦藏者報吿，在烏干達與坦噶尼加湖之間，發見一含礦地帶，蘊藏金，銅，鉛，鎳等鑛物，區域甚廣云。</p>
<h3>米市表面平淡　油價仍然報漲　黃豆高峯迭出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米情仍趨平淡之勢，南北市共到九百三十餘石，西貢米配售共計六千九百三十包，價照常，白元陰元形勢亦平淡，塲外粳米少神而乏交，油市動蕩甚烈，靑島來電報漲，人心向榮，生油加三四千元，菜汕淸油均漲三五千元，豆油貨少奇俏，黄豆東北尙未解凍，來貨稀少，隴海綫近乏到源，油廠本街及外埠依然採納甚殷，市勢求過於供，高峯層出，飛漲三五千元，豆餅因原料續漲，汕厦納胃仍濃，再見奔跳一千二三百元，洋粉貨主堅挺，回升千餘元，本粉平平，麩皮續降二三百元，菉豆轉漲二三千元，苞米來貨甚少，續加三四千元，紅糧去化俏利，步砌三四千元，小委依然挺站，芝蔴亦漲二千元，廣帮略動，生仁仍居平庸之格。</p>
<p>又訊，社會局昨又派員繼續査獲違反議價之米號十八家，速前日之六十家，共計七十八家。據糧食科吉科長吿，該批違法米號，即依經濟部取締違反限價議價條例懲處。其最重者處十倍以下罰金及七日以下之拘役。</p>
<p>麵粉趨勢轉好，昨黑市價每包四萬四，救濟麵粉之黑市則爲二萬八千七。食油價見上漲，荳油黑市廿二萬，生油十九萬五，菜油十七萬五。</p>
<h3>出口津貼辦法實施後　進出口業之觀測</h3>
<p>短時期中或可收相當成效物價逐步上漲則依然無補</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕出口津貼辦法公佈後，一般人均甚注視，據某出口業中人談：此項辦法之規定，對於我國將近停頓之出口事業，可視爲一極大刺激，百分之百津貼制，在今後一二月中，或可收得相當成効，惟國內人工之高昂，與出口貨物價格之上騰，亦不可不予重視，我國大宗出口之負品，如絲，茶，豬鬃，桐油，牛羊皮，藥材等，其中豬鬃一項，在出口津貼制規定以前，因人工高昂，與大帮收購者殺價等關係，全國豬鬃工業，已有百分之五十瀕於破產，此番津貼辦法規，工人乘勢請求提高工資、乃不可避免之事實，近日豬鬃價格已高漲百分之二十左右，如此種悄形無法改善，則百分之百出口津貼，可能因出口物品價格之上　而逐漸抵消，又如桐油之出口，以前因外匯關係，由香港轉運外國，可多得二成以上之利潤，此次津貼辦法規定，向香港謀取出路之桐油，或將改途易輒，重返上海，其他絲茶藥材等之輸出亦將蓬勃展開，故出口津貼辦法，有利亦有弊，在目前固司視爲救急之策，以後成効如何，則未可預卜也。又據進出口公會方面表示，津貼辦法之規定，在目前因可鼓動我國之出口事業，惟國內局勢不穩定，物價逐步高漲，出口津貼縱規定爲百分之二百，亦有被物價高漲抵銷之可能，故此項辦法，僅司視爲救急，其前途不能絕對樂觀。</p>
<h3>中信開會決定配售人造絲　暫以絲織及織帶兩業爲限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理政府物資委員會昨爲配售人造絲事，特於上午十時，召開會議，到該局王子健，楊泮生等，列席有絲織業劉慶一，宋保林等。王子健氏即席報告，略稱：對日易貨後，中信局曾先後裝到日末人造絲三批：首批四一五〇箱，二批四八五〇箱，三批六〇〇〇箱，總數共計一五〇〇〇箱。中信局配售情形，計絲織業七〇六四箱，織帶業三八四箱，針織業一〇八箱，染織業二九六箱；外埠方面，計天津五〇〇箱，盛澤蘇州五一〇箱，杭州一二二五箱，無錫九箱，湖州八箱，本外埠德數配出一〇一〇四箱，現尙剩四八九六箱。旋楊泮生氏報吿，略稱：對日易貨之日貨人造絲，本年上半年度輸入我國數額，可能减少。蓋日本生產人造絲一磅，需食鹽二磅。而日本目前缺鹽，故人造絲產量，可能减少。惟下半年或可望增產。現當局正擬多運食鹽赴日易貨。至第四期之易貨人造絲，現正接洽中。中信局現決就存量　配，以敷需要。最後絲織業方面，希望中信局仍繼配售。討論經過，決定絲織及織帶兩業所需用之人造絲，仍由中信局照常配售。惟針織及染織兩業則暫停。下週起，先配絲織業，照其申請量先配五分之一。織帶業則尙待審核，而後規定配售日期，配價照舊不變。聞絲織業方面願保證，此後該業配貨，決不流入黑市。又該業現已通知各同業，如以前未曾塡具申請書者，應另行補塡，於今日中午十二時以前送到公會，俾便彙送中信局申請。</p>

<h3>空中賑冀西</h3>
<p>— 本報駐津記者李紹林</p>
<p>天津一月卅日航訊</p>
<p>共軍封鎖下的冀西，在諸種碍難及運輸不便的情形下，善後救濟工作始終未能展開，不僅是平漢北段連綿不斷的戰火，隔斷輸送物資的途徑，而且共黨對行總的成見，更是使救濟工作不能推動的主因，寒冬到來後，冀西需要救濟的情形，益加迫切起來，並非一日造成的貧困，在荒凉凋蔽的冀西，家家戶戶幾乎無一家不是在無衣無食的艱窘情况下掙扎，聯總和行總深認這一地區賑濟工作的必要，經多日努力，終致獲得共方諒解，得在冀西展開救濟工作。關於救濟物資的運送，則由行總與美軍簽定合同，以美機協助運輸作空中投擲，此事曾順利的獲得何華德司令及美空軍司令桑德遜將軍的熱誠贊助，而於一月二十八日宣吿實現。</p>

<p>關於救濟工作的執行，聯總方面事先派了五位美籍職員計爲奧斯別克博士，柯別克氏，謝齡氏，多依爾女士和堪德爾女士去冀西事先佈置，救濟地區相投擲目標被選擇爲太行山　中的　平縣，然後由此運轉於其他地區，起運地則待天津方面物資運送完畢後，再自北平裝運，美軍方面爲協助完成此一任務，計撥有C四十六型運輸機三架，據聯總天津辦事處負責人表示，此次擬空運冀西救濟物資，天津方面有冬衣一千八百包，毛毯一千七百條，衣着用物七百包中式棉衣一千七百八十一包，北平方面，有冬衣八百二十八包，舊冬衣一千二百零六小包，原包冬衣七百六十八包，毛毯及被褥九十七包，棉衣一千套，藥品十六箱，從二十八日起，三架飛機將於每日上下午各出動一决，預定兩星期運送完畢，飛機運費，每小時爲美金六十五元。</p>
<p>首次出動</p>
<p>二十八日爲空中投送之第一日，經過上午一度出動，投擲進行極爲順利，下午之第二次飛行，津市記者乃獲得美軍許可，搭機同行，凌空參觀，各報記者齊集於津市張貴莊飛機塲後，首先被行總人員引導參觀飛機塲內的臨時倉庫，所有待運物資，經主辦人員日以繼夜的照料，都已被集中到這裏，參觀旣畢，初次出動的運輸一機都於午十二時許相繼歸來，牠們是在十時二十分安抵阜平上空，十時四十五分認淸目標投下第一批，十一時零七分投擲完舉，當第一次出動時，行總平津分署副署長顧德銘，聯總平津辦事處負責人楊錦魁，駐華美海軍陸戰隊司令何華德將軍均曾在塲照料，這次投擲顯然受到各方的重視。</p>
<p>二次出動</p>
<p>第二次出動在下午二時，各記者於塡寫姓名報吿體重並簽署棄權狀後相繼登機，飛機遂即升空，翱翔西飛，天津市的煩囂市面方自眼底消逝接着便展開河北大平原的圖畫，俯首下望，大地上阡陌縱横溶雪成冰，乾枯的樹枝呆呆的豎在地上，越發顯得冷靜寂寞，二時半三機相繼飛臨太行山上，山陰積雪未溶，羣峯簇擁，疏落的農村稀散的點綴在谷間，有是令人想象到牠的瘠苦。飛抵阜平後，駕駛員迅即發現了萬山　中白旗所表示的投擲標誌，於是飛機俯衝而下，直降至二百五十公尺之低空，此時機上美軍都已用繩索繫牢身軀，由機門將包裹推落，盤旋四决，乃將所載物品盡行投出，其時從飛機上可以很淸晰的看見那些包裹直降到地面上去，地面上有百餘個農民打扮的人佇立在那裏，旁邊還有十幾輛騾車，想來是在等待着收取這些救濟品。</p>
<p>冀西歸來</p>
<p>四時十分大家平安飛返津市張貴莊機塲，都　鬆的透了一口氣，但却不由的懷念着那貧瘠的冀西。那冀西貧困的人民，從別的中共區　救濟工作情形說明，中共對救濟物資常是不能如聯總行總所規定的的辦法發放，這耗費中外若干人力物力而投擲下去的救濟品是否能即被合理的分發到每一個確實需要救濟的人民手裏，不能不令人顧念。</p>
<h3>烽火中帶着新的展望　海門在挺進中</h3>
<p>— 定一</p>
<p>蘇北海門廿日訊</p>
<p>勝利而多難的三十五年，在遍地烽火中，已忽忽地溜過，恰逢到三十六年來臨的時候，誰都會帶着一個新的展望。　位於揚子江下游三角地帶而與　　江南僅僅一江之隔的蘇北海　　，水陸交通均甚便利，文化　　亦稱發達，說起來，雖然比　　上江南諸縣的民殷物阜，但全　　六十餘萬人；，每年土產品，也　以自給自足，除了少數的食　，要仰賴外埠輸入外，每年雜　平均可輸出一二萬擔，供給其　　縣。本來，這嚴冬的季節裏　　他們獲得僅有一個悠長的休　時期，以恢復一下倦乏的身心　但是連年遭着不幸，這塊安逸　樂土已變得滿目瘡　，百廢待興了，老百姓也是喘喘一息，勝利以後，誰部熱望着政府早日復員，得能安居樂業，可是這一年來，由於奸匪的稱兵作亂，在蘇北各地，燃起了燎原的烽火，發動　各種慘無人道的鬥爭，殘殺，陷害，遍地都橫陳腐尸和衝鼻的血腥氣，海門也隨着匪軍的亂禍，而再度遭受到空前浩刦。老百姓都在失望了，尤其是陷於匪區的民衆，在奸匪「分田」，「倒租」，「翻身」，「淸算」以及其他暴行，加緊壓迫下，眞是暗無天日。千百萬難胞被迫地流亡在異鄉，餐風飲露，啼飢號寒，遙望着鄕梓，臨風揮淚。</p>
<p>解民倒懸　收復縣城外圍</p>
<p>四週的匪軍依然威脅着海門，使海門一直處在緊張不安的狀態中。尤其是在二個月前，劉前縣長將要奉調的時候，海門四週的匪軍更形蠢動。割據，破壞，不斷威脅着。他們更大規模的結集了成千成萬的兵力，將僅離海門縣城十餘里的天補，壩頭兩鎭外圍據點一舉攻陷，大洪鎭亦相繼淪落，奸匪一方面搜括着老百姓的血汗，用大船小船捆載而去，同時又將靑年壯丁强迫的拉去，有的屠殺了，有的是補充了他們的兵額，而年靑的婦女也給他們擄去，做奸匪的「慰勞隊」。當時海門已岌岌可危，民衆更陷於極度惶惶不安的狀態中，這是海門情勢最爲緊張的一個時期。就在這時候，新任縣長謝庭陞氏，於各界熱烈歡迎聲中蒞任了。謝縣長一到任，首先將縣城外圍天補，壩頭二鎭全部收復，海門不安的民心，始漸趨鎭定，進一步的把海門縣城的治安，加強起來，並且把海門動盪不安的社會秩序，也逐漸加以恢復。</p>
<p>五百殘匪　發動攻勢未逞</p>
<p>上月十六日，一個陰雨漫天的早晨，殘餘的匪軍又復蠢然思動，捲土重來，結集了五百多人的兵力，在縣城北十華里之壩頭鎭發動了一决大規模瘋狂的攻擊，駐防在該地的保安隊自衛隊全部被圍，且有突入據點之勢，情况是萬分的危急，當謝縣長接到報吿時，隨即調國軍及保安隊還鄕隊等前往增援，並爲鼓勵士氣，確保人民安全起見，親自偕同國軍獨立第一團第二營營長寗加餘綏靖司令部張參謀等赴前綫指揮，在英勇督戰之下，經過了整個一天的壯烈戰鬥，始將來犯匪軍全部擊潰。民衆聞訊，莫不歡呼雀躍，額手稱慶。</p>
<p>國軍突擊　東境添了屛障</p>
<p>這裏的國軍獨一團，從去年五月中進駐海門以來，已經半年多了，該團共三營：第一第二兩營，在去年十一月奉令進駐啓東，第一營是留防在海門境內，營長寗加餘，爲人豪直，英勇敢戰，允對士兵的敎管，極爲嚴格。平日我們道途中，幾幾乎無法可以看到他們的士兵，差不多有些人還不知道這裏有國軍駐防着，偶而在街市上，見到他們一二個士兵在買東西，對老百姓總是和顏悅色的，充分表示出親熱的情態，所以這裏的民衆，沒有一個不對他們有着特別好感，但在作戰時，活躍在前綫的健兒的，也就是他們這一羣。可見他們軍風紀的良好，作戰力的堅强，確是難能可貴。在半月以前，該部國軍奉令配洽海門第四五六區區鄕自衛隊，及　　隊，進駐　　鎭，當時奸匪結集了二千名以上的兵力，在深夜十時將他們全部包圍，國軍被迫　開自衛，沉着應戰，經過了一整夜的壯烈戰鬥，至翌晨排曉時，國軍終於英勇地突圍出擊，卒將　軍全部擊潰。這樣，海門　境，又增添了一重雄偉的障屛，打開了全境復員的難關。</p>
<p>展開縣政　全境復員有望</p>
<p>爲了澈底肅淸境內匪軍，確保外圍據點，以鞏固地方治安起見，縣政府除加强了原有天補，三和壩頭等鎭據點外，並先後收復大洪鎭重要據點，建立常樂·長興。三星等鎭重要據點，日夜督飭保安團隊會同國軍掃蕩境內殘匪，展開淸剿工作。</p>
<p>最近海門縣政府爲奉令配合軍事進展，推進全境復員，乃先後令飭各區區鄕鎭行政人員曁各區區自衛隊·保安隊·配合國軍，分向該區內推選，現在已經進駐到的地區，向南可控制整個縣境的沿江數十里漫長地帶，及向西北兩面四十餘華里與南通交界之邊境以內地區，均已全部推進，向東也已進駐到距縣城五十華里的麒麟鎭，及七十華里的三陽鎭的外綫，建築了大外圍的堅强堡壘，並且逐步的修復了控制區內的交通路機，現在已經修復通車的公路，計有至南通的通海公路，至二甲鎭的茅朝公路，及至四甲壩的公路，這些公路均可暢通無阻。在政府軍隊加强保護下，交通治安頗爲穩固。海啓公路也已能直達麒麟鎭，不久即可全綫打通，而各公路沿綫的電話也架設了，老百姓已經可以自由自在地在廣闊的公路上邁步了。</p>
<p>在這歲序更新的時候，預計全境復員，當指日可望了。</p>

<h3>普遍的种痘　醫藥科學的先驅　對病菌戰之初步</h3>
<p>— 錢惠</p>
<p>報載自去冬以還，天花在香港流行甚烈，在上海亦頗有　見，受染者以兒童為多，死亡者以數十計，衛生當局乃有於年內強迫種痘至三百數十萬人之計劃，為　　文對種痘加以介紹與申　。</p>
<p>種痘之起源</p>
<p>天花為最強烈　　性　傳染病之一，由於冬季時節吾人易於密切接觸，在冬季特別流行，由於其無先大免疫性，無論長幼男女同有高度之感染性，幼童更易受染，民有更高之死亡率。本症之存在，恐有二千年以上之歷史，流行甚烈，死亡率高，中外同然。自經驗中得知如患過一次輕症，即可避免再發重症，因於無意中發明接種方法，依照我國舊法，有水苗（天花痂　水醮棉花塞入鼻中），旱苗（痂粉吹入鼻中），痘衣（以曾患天花兒童之內衣予健康兒童穿二三天）及　過天花患者之乳母即令另諉哺乳兒等方法。雖然於施行時選用輕型患者之　料，但嚴重傳染與中間接觸傳染之發生，仍不能免，且不能廣泛推行，以是本病仍斷續發生或流行不止。</p>
<p>雖然吾人已知天花之濾渦性　發種於牛，牛患牛痘；而牛痘之　適性毒接種於人，則不患天花，惟兩者病你體間之抗體原，血清與形態學之關係則迄未明暸。至於兩者間之免疫關係，却早於一七四四年前早經有心人加以觀察。在英國　Cloucettershire地方之牛乳女工，因與患有痘之牛按觸，彼等手上患有牛痘，而彼等在天花流行時不染天花。一九六八年起，该处之医生　纳Riwaril　Jermer作深切之觀察，終于一七九六年將染有牛痘之女工手上之痘　接種放一健康兒童，此童因患牛痘，後再以天花病人之痘　接種於此童子，結果竟不得病。自此確知牛痘非僅能自牛染及於人而免除天花，即患有牛痘者之　　亦能接種於另一人而預防天花，乃於一七九入年發表結果。此種發見，賓為近代人工免疫法之福矢。雖然當初不乏封此抱懷疑態度者，但事實迅即為　界所接受，而以牛患之痘為牛痘，以牛痘　接種於人為種痘及　痘可以預防天花之　實亦即　　　所公認。</p>
<p>自此以后、牛痘接種法流傳於和國。於一八〇五年傳入我國，不　於　　各國　能利用此種感覺。　　執行，本病將近絕跡之　，（如在吾國　　在一八七二　尚有二五八五人由　致此，一九〇四年尚死二百餘人，自一九二四年　　　痘之　　至今無一患者）而　我國則因　行不力　　　　痘方法尚未絕跡，仍年有　病　見，　外無算、實足惋常。</p>
<p>衛生界的執行</p>
<p>種痘之價　既如上述，官方應予廣泛　　執行，人民　應業於接受，始無疑義，惟應如何執行並如何注意，則有予以介紹之必要。再分述如次：</p>
<p>（一）　　年　——由於嬰兒易於受　且　　軍之　示，嬰兒出生在四至六個月之　應　代為種痘，不足月及營養不良之嬰兒則稍　，在入學之前，青春期各種一次，此後則任何人在本病流行期　應隨時再種，以策安全。</p>
<p>（二）接稱季節，應視健康情形氣候有否全身傳染病及皮膚病而定，如署天易有出汗搔癢多皮膚病，冬季多其他傳染病而影響兒童之健康，可能因種症而誘起全身或局部之併發症，則似以初冬或仲春較為適當。糖尿病患者易於招致皮膚傳染，亦可稍緩。但如有天花流行，應隨時放棄此種小顧慮以求大體之安全。</p>
<p>（三）接稱地方，通常男孩選用上臂外側之上三分之一，女子為避免疤痕有換雅觀計可接種於大腿外側之上三分之一或小腿中三分之一之外側，總以能不受汗液沾染或過多之摩擦為原則。</p>
<p>（四）接種法，先以火酒，以脫或醋酮在　備接種之處擦淨待幹之後，取冷藏而未過期之痘苗滴於其上，然後用消毒之針在該處輕輕劃上長約一公分之刻痕一二道，或以針於其處乘直輕刺五六次，或斜握針於其處括過幾次，均以能將痘苜種入皮內而不致出血為上，餘漿用淨綿花擦去，不必另加敷料，在廿四小時內應勿入浴或用肥皂洗刷該處。如果以後局部有膿　發生，應加蓋並逐日更換消毒敷料，至其貼着之後勿再揭去，而在共痂脫落之前勿再入浴。</p>
<p>（五）　　，如所附痘苗尚未失效，而接種煎徒未用強烈消　劑或水洗，則接種後應有反應。反應之過早卻與其有否免疫性為反此，反應可有下列數種（一）如一二日內局部有　紅癢，不久即　，可視為當時有免疫力，（二）如在三五日內局部有一二公分大之紅膿，上有水　，全力有　熱等反應，可視為有部份之免疫力，（三）若在五日後局部有較大之紅腫水　，水　逐漸長大變成膿　，全身有發熱疼痛，局部淋巴腺腫痛等，是為「出痘」，亦即表示此人實有天花之感染性。</p>
<p>經過成功之接種，即出痘之後，十二日內即發生對天花之免疫力，跟天花之潛伏期為八至十二日故如在接觸天花之後即經妥當之種痘而有良好之發出，即可無發病之虞，即使遲至發病之前數日接種，亦可使其發作為輕型。如經接種之後局部毫無反應，與其解繹為有免疲力，無　視為疫苗不良或接種之方法不良所致，應隔兩星期重種一次以至其有反應為止，蓋據史籍所載有種至十三次乃發出者。</p>
<p>偶或於接種之後，局部受染向患膿腫或淋巴腺炎者應照外科方法處埋之；或因痘苗未盡擦去或因局部膿　液再沾染於他處而他處亦發生自己接種現象，亦無嚴重之結果；在極少數之例遇有因種症而潑生嚴重之神經系症狀者，但此種機會極少，較之不種痘而患天花，其危險亦不足道。</p>
<p>就一般而言，一次接種發出可有五年左右之免疫，而在一次得病之後可以終身免疫，但仍然復發者偶亦有之，故吾謂在天花流行時期仍以每人接受種痘最為妥善也。</p>
<h3>蘇北的憂患之一　黑熱病</h3>
<p>— 殷綏和</p>
<p>黑熱病這個名稱。對於吾們上海附近的人們，多少有些陌生；因為牠是個蘇北華北一帶的地方性疾病。不過近年來交通一天大便利，從蘇北來往的客商也一天天多起來，所以在上海患黑熱病的病人，也時常可以見到，像吾們幾所實習醫院裏面，經常可以找出幾個來。這個疾病將來是否會流行到這邊來，那可也說不一定！</p>
<p>這個病的徵象，從他的名稱上，多少可以有幾分影像；因為患這類疾病的人，半數以上，皮膚略呈黑色；加以遷延不斷的弛強熱，所以命名謂之黑熱病。牠的病源，是在一種白蛉子叮人吸血的時候，把寄生在牠身體裏的一種原蟲Leishmania　Donovani　入人體，經過二個到四個月的潛伏時期，然從開始發作。熱型類似傷寒。有時也會乍寒乍熱，同　疾相仿；不過牠有個特點，就是在廿四小時內的熱型，可能有二三次的忽高忽低。如此情形，經過三四星期之後，體溫降為平度；過了二三星期，這個忽高忽低的熱度，又來上幾星期；三　四復，可以來上個一年半載。在患病一個月之從，脾臟已經開始腫脹；在六們月的時候，可以腫大到肚臍附近。同時肝臟也有相當腫脹。病人則日見瘦弱，四肢無力，時覺頭痛目眩，偶有盜汗　　，皮膚則漸呈黑色。如若不加治療，長則二三年，短則一二年，就將危及生命。以前在沒有發　　　治療之前，凡患此病者，＋之八九淪於死亡；但今科學　明，　　有方，死亡率不通十份之一二而已。</p>
<p>診斷方面、除上述各種徵象之外，尚有血液之檢驗；脾，肝，骨　之穿刺檢查，可以得到正面證寶。血液除貧血之外，還有白血球總數減低、多核性白血球之百分數減低，都是黑熱病的特黴。球蛋白和真球蛋白的增加，也是牠的獨有之點。當然這些還不能算是確實證據，倘然能夠行脾臟，肝臟，和骨髓的穿刺衛，那你一定可找到那些罪孽深重的原蟲。這是單細胞的，最起碼，最下等的動物。可是不知道牠們每年要處死吾們多少蘇北同胞。</p>
<p>在治療上說起來，以前是可以算在醫束手的；是從一九一四年發明　劑治療，（如馴Neostieosan，Neostam—Urea，Stibamine，Solustibosan）之後，患者十之八九可以得救；這也許司算是最近三十年內患者之　運。不渦治療不如預防，吾還希望當地衛生行政當局，能夠多多注重預防，以杜絕其根源，這將對於吾們蘇北同胞，以及外國居民，造福不淺也。</p>
<h3>談麻疹</h3>
<p>— 彭大恩</p>
<p>解答小孩出疹子的許多問題</p>
<p>近來麻疹流行，從初冬迄今，仍未衰減，一般有未出過麻疹孩子的父母，一定在日夜担憂着，不知他們的孩子，會不會染到麻疹？有什麼預防的好辦法？如果真的出起麻疹來，應該如何處置，使他們趕快痊癒？本文即對諸如此類的問題，作一總解答。</p>
<p>（一）什麼人會出麻疹？</p>
<p>根據統計的結果，百分之九十五的人類，在一生的某時期中都出過麻疹，百分之五十是五歲以下的兒童，但幼小的嬰兒，從初生至六月是不易感染麻疹的，因為大多數母親己經患過麻疹，她們血內對麻疹的免疫抗體能由胎盤輸入胎兄，但是道種被動性免疫力不能持久，自出生後逐漸減少，到五六月差不多完全消失，自五六月到學齡，是最易感染的時期，明瞭了這一點，家庭中如有麻疹病例，那麼六月以下的嬰兒可不必隔離，其餘未出過的，都有被染的危險，尤其是在戰後人口劇增的上海，住屋的極度擁擠，更助長麻疹的蔓延，使牠流行成疫。</p>
<p>（二）與麻疹患者按觸的兒童應該如何處置？</p>
<p>照常理言，每人在一生的某一時期中必定要患一次麻症，而且一次之後，可以終身免疫，省了以後的麻煩，所以一般身體健康，年齡稍長的兒童，在流行感染從，司任其自然，但在某種情形下、如年齡過幼，（一二歲），平日營養不良，有各種慢性急性疾患者，如肺結核病，百日咳等，如果再接連得麻疹，那麼火上加油，幼小孱弱的身體，一定會不能支持而夭折，因此我們應該使這些兒童避免麻疹，如果不能避免，也得使症狀減輕，要達到上項目的，就必須應用「被動免疫法」，目前常用約有下列幾種製品，供肌肉注射（見附表）</p>
<p>上述數種製品，各有利弊。成人血清及胎盤球蛋白比較容易發生反應，但是容易購置獲得，麻疹痊愈期血清雖然沒有反應，但是大多數人不肯把自己麻疹剛痊愈的孩子的血抽出來保護別人，人血清子球蛋白在美國己普遍採用，並且有很好的效果。</p>
<p>上述各種製品，都須在受染後最初五六日，（潛伏期的上半期）內注射，否則不能產生保護之效，再者經上述方法產生的免疲力都是被動的，只能維特到八個星期，如果三星期後又與別的麻疹病人接觸，受染，應當再行注射。至於自動免疫方法，經拉開氏沙佛爾氏等之研究，恐怕不久就有成功的希望了。</p>
<p>（三）麻疹的症狀是怎樣的？</p>
<p>在麻疹流行的時候，凡是沒有生過麻疹的孩子，一旦發生感冒症狀，我們都得細心觀察，提防麻疹的發生，因為麻疹的症狀，在最初三四天—侵要期—內，和普通的上呼吸道發炎是沒有會麼分別的。患者開始覺得全身不舒服，頭痛發熟，胃口不好，常常打噴嚏，眼睛怕亮光，流眼淚，咳嗽，哭聲嘶哽，幼小的嬰兒，如果發熱太高，可以發生昏睡，驚厥。這個時候，診斷不能確定，但如果有與患麻疹者接觸的歷史，這可能是很大的，過了二十四—三十六小時，孩子的面頰粘膜貼近日齒的地方，就發出麻疹特有的「科潑力克氏」斑，這個時候，醫生就能確定麻疹的診斷了。</p>
<p>發熱從的第三四天皮疹開始發出。先志於頭發根耳朵後頭頸等地方，然後很快的蔓延到前額二頰，再到全身，皮疹最初是很稀少玫瑰紅色的丘疹，以後多起來，互相運接在一起，顏色也變得暗紅一點，在皮疹全盛的時候，熱度加高到一百另四五度，全身病狀，一般加重，皮疹經三四日即退隱，先出的地方先退，並有細小像　麩狀的皮屑脫落，這時候熱度漸漸降下米，病孩精神頓覺舒暢，飯食漸增，直到康復，須三四星期之久。</p>
<p>（四）怎樣當心患麻疹的孩子？</p>
<p>上海缺乏傳染病院，而一般普通兒科病房，不能收容患麻疹的病孩，所以麻疹的病例，往往都留居在家中，醫生至多每大來診治一次，其餘護理的責任，全靠母親或別的家長了。</p>
<p>（A）房間設備——麻診是最易傳染的濾過性毒所致的疾病。所以患者應該和別人隔離，侍候來往於房間的人越少越好，並且一律須帶口罩，用消毒藥水洗手，減少病孩受別種細菌傳染的機會。</p>
<p>房間陣設力求簡單，空氣流通，陽光充足，但如果日光太強，可懸布幔，避免直射，室內溫度宜在華氏七十度之下，濕度合宜，病孩絕對臥床休息，直至痊愈為出。</p>
<p>（B）清潔第一——我真不懂中國人流行的信念，「出麻疹不可以楷面」是根據了什麼理由？我真不懂得一般父母為什麼會這樣盲目的去做，而且一些也不馬虎？所以我們常常看見患麻疹的孩子，數日數夜，甚至於數星期不楷面，不洗手，滿面眼污。鼻涕。難道這樣會使麻疹早日痊愈嗎？不，決不，這不過是加增病孩不必須忍受的痛苦，相反的，在出麻疹的時候，因為呼吸道的發炎，眼耳口鼻的分泌物都加增，更須常常洗面嗽口，使口臭減輕，保特顏面及口腔內清潔，避免各稱眼炎口炎，尤其是兇險的走馬　，若等到孩子的口氣像大便一樣的臭，面頰穿破，牙齒落掉，再想辦法，己經是太遲了</p>
<p>（C）打倒「忌嘴」——患麻疹的孩子，應該多飲水份，尤其是在熱度很高，胃納不佳的時候，容易消化的食物，特別是牛乳稀飯等仍應照常供給，除非有腹瀉，可以酌量減少，熱度下降，胃口增加時，飲食也應隨之增加，雞蛋肉湯橘子水魚肝油尤其重要，許多愚昧父母，往往受了庸醫的指使，很嚴厲的給病孩忌口，險了一些白開水，炒米湯之外不給孩子吃別的東西，並且有的延長到牛月一月之久，雖然孩子有很好的胃口。日子一久孩子的眼睛睜不開了，如果醫治太遲，可致　月失明，這是甲種維生素缺乏所引起的幹眼病，在歐美各國很少，但在中國的麻疹病例中已是司空見慣。這都是「忌嘴」的後果，輕一點的，縱使眼睛不受影響，但等到麻疹痊癒只　了一副皮包骨的骷髏，本來有結核病的，在這營養減退的時候，結核病菌就乘機活躍起來，急速蔓延成　粒性桔核病，或者結核性腦膜炎而致死亡。別種化膿性細菌如肺炎球菌溶性鏈球菌葡萄球菌等，也得到了好機會，產生各稱併發症，如喉頭炎，中耳炎，枝氣管肺炎，而使患者喪失生命，其中尤以枝氣管師炎為最大</p>
<p>（D）藥物只能梢為幫忙——麻疹雖然迄今仍無特效藥品，但如果患者身體本健康，護理得宜，沒有併發病，往往自己痊愈，沒有後患藥物的應用不過是對症的治療而己，譬如皮膚太癢，可用稀重炭酸納水塗佈，熱度太高，或者有神經性症狀，可用退熱劑，鎮靜劑，咳嗽厲害，用止咳藥，喉頭發炎用水蒸氣噴霧法等，磺胺屬化學物品，如磺胺　唑或磺胺　啶（地亞淨）可預先給予，防止鏈球菌肺炎球菌等引起之感染，但這稱藥物必須在醫生指導之下服用，家長不可自作聰明，隨意應用。</p>
<p>製品名稱　劑量　反應</p>
<p>一·人血清Camma球蛋白二—四公撮　無</p>
<p>二·麻疹全愈期血清　三—七公撮　幾無</p>
<p>三·成人全血或血清　二十—三十公撮　較多</p>
<p>四·胎盤球蛋白製劑　五公撮　較多</p>
<h3>從「青年心理修養」說起</h3>
<p>— 猷先</p>
<p>「青年心理修養」這本書的著者丁瓚先生是國內心理治療學方面的專家之一，無須我再介紹。這本書裏的材料，全是他年來在心理門診親身聽那些青年們　慟的訴說他們內心的苦惱，所得來的經驗和見解。現在他將這些經驗和見解，用通俗而生動的文字發表了出來。他是在告訴我們，中國的青年們是遭遇着怎樣的磨折。這些動人的故事，坦白的指示我們，中國的家庭，學校，社會，乃至整個的民族，正面臨着一個極端嚴重的問題——人間關係的失調！實在說起來，他不僅造成青年的苦痛，就是整例社會的的墮落，政治的貪污，黨派的糾紛，甚而內戰的蔓延，都是這個「人問關係失調」的問題，沒有得到合理的解決，所招致的。他可以引起國際的爭端，擾亂世界的和平。人類不能忽視這似間題！成功的日子祇管遙遠，但是行遠必自　，登高必自卑，「開步走」先必須的！</p>
<p>家庭中的父母和學校裏的教師，對於兒童的教養，當然是直按負責的，然而新知識的普及，舊習慣的革除，顯然是有著相當的困難，也需要相當的時間。除了一些先知先覺的文化界領袖以外，將來最有力的推動者，應當還是醫師們。</p>
<p>一提到醫師，却令人不寒而慄了！細細的一翻閱各難誌報章上的「醫藥問答」以及「社會服務」可以知道，投函問病的人們，十之七八是受著病態心理的磨擦，可憐這般狹隘的醫師們，自己本是先天不足後天失調的殘廢人，不能把正確的答案吐露出來。「手淫」何嘗是「陽痿」「早洩」的主因呢？心理分析的構成學者告訴我們，手浮太無實，那與手淫時所伴發的幻想，　是有害於心理健康的。那幻想的對象也許是逆倫的。這種反常幻想中的矛盾現象或罪孽感，乃至畏懼手淫，或是因為不克戒除手淫所生的悔恨心理，　是產生陽痿的主因。性功能的失常是許多心理病態的通常表現。真正的創傷是在心靈內。</p>
<p>「神經衰弱」已經成了一個很通俗的病名。但是這些病人的神經又何嘗真的衰弱呢？許多的實在是有著神經過敏的表現。他們言過其實的誇大他們的病痛，或是難於忍受微小的不適。他們的交感神經是在影響着意志神經的機能。這些病人心靈深處的下意識裏，都壓抑着不能會展的情緒。那是得病的根源。這些可憐的患者們，走遍了大大小小的醫院診所，化費了無數的冤枉錢，嚼盡了廣告中的各色秘製藥，病魔卻一步也不肯放鬆他們。最後他們投入了「醫藥顧問」「社會服務」的懷抱裏去。看他們是如何的哀懇，謙卑的乞憐呢？他們說我是本報的忠實讀者，自從貴報增加社會服務版以來，所解答的各種病症及治療方法，甚為詳盡，造福人　，欽仰之至。他們是多麼熟烈的期待救援呢？但是結果，所得到的答案，不是「須來診所檢查」，就是「多服補品，強壯劑」，「長期冷水浴」，「冷水洗下部」，「連續注射「賜保命」可有效」。卻不知這些妙方妙藥，他們早就都試驗過了。若干的「大醫師」，卻沒有一位能指與他們一條明路。醫師們太過於忽視病人心理方面的創傷了！</p>
<p>不久以前，作者曾與一位青年的醫師談到「神經衰弱」的問題，他衝口而出的說道：「唉！多得很。每天看病總有兩三個。真討厭，沒辦法！」這些剛出醫學院大門的醫師，似乎沒有讀過精神病學，似乎不知道有所謂「心理分析」學。聲學院校中之忽視醫事心理學也就可見一斑了。</p>
<p>據專家估計，病人中的三分之一，是心理病態的患者。另有三分之一也因着心理的不健全。加重了病體的苦痛。所以可以說，每十個病人中倒有七個是在受着心理病態的磨折。似是醫師們大多數是「解剖」「病理」「注射」「手術」所造就出來的。每每忘記了那臥在床上的病者，乃是有情緒的人類。醫師與病者之間的關係問題，有些醫　　育家倒也注意到，但是　態的情緒與疾病的關聯，在中國還極少受到注意。美國最近的十年來，有所謂「心身醫學」，突飛猛進，己經奠定了堅實的基礎。為了迎頭趕上，我國醫學同道不當再抱殘守缺的專向病理學內尋求疾病的答案了。要成功為一位心理分析專家是不容易的。然而既負了診治病「人」的責任，就必須對於這「人」的情緒具有相當的常識。今日的一般醫師們，都應當平心靜氣問一問自己，「我與　醫有甚麼分別」？</p>
<p>華國Temble大學醫學院的內科教授魏氏（Edward　Weiss）在所著「心身醫學」的自序裏提到，廿年以前，當他出了病理學的大門進人臨病不久的時候。他遇到了一位年青的女病人，患着原因不明的頭痛。利用病理的學　和科學的精神，他做盡了檢查和實驗，但是找不出這頭痛的原因。在這全部的研究中，他曾做一次腰椎穿刺。在這簡單的手術以後，病勢反而加重了。除了厲害的頸痛以外，又加上了腰痛，和腸胃的症狀。這位病人臥在床上，足足約有九個月不能下地。在這個期間，又不知進行了多少檢查和實驗，但是結果都是陰性的。最後病人的家　不能再忍耐了，於是決定另請了－位老聲師。這位老醫師原是他們的家庭醫師，病人在見童的時期，就是由這位醫師照顧着的。他曉得那位肯年的科學家所忽略的－點。原來病人的哥哥，也就是這一家之長，有了一位女友。二人頗有結婚的可能。這位妹妹不贊成他們結婚，但是又無法反對。他的病就是反抗這婚姻的幼稚表示。病因一經說明，他於是當然痊愈了。這種有價值的一課，提示了送位青年的醫師，單單學得病理的知識，是不夠做一位醫師的。放徒他努力重行充實自己，重行教育自己。</p>
<p>我們每日在臨症時，遇到許多的原因不明的患者，醫師們不是把他們看做走上門來的肥羊，任意宰割，就是將他們當做病理標本，一味的研究。忽視了這些生物是有情緒的問題在內。用愁眉苦臉對着我們訴說種種苦痛的「人」是有情緒的。心理的創傷是在磨折着三分之二的病人。醫學是在時時的革新。醫師們需要重行充實自己，重行教育自己。問一問你自己：「我是不是一個　醫了？」</p>

<h3>水碓旁</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>前後左右，都是山　，彷彿像屏障一樣。－條水從山問流下來，流得非常激，發出潺潺的響聲。</p>
<p>山理沒有樹木，枯黃的野草，長得樣　鬃一樣，大石塊顯着各種奇異的形狀，滿佈在山頸和山腳。山凹間，光綫很黴　，不容易見到陽光。許多深陷的地方，積雪還很厚。</p>
<p>野鳥們在山腰間啄着蒼苔，不時發出一兩聲叫聲。腳爪兒把所留的殘雪抓得紛紛落下。</p>
<p>澗水非常澄清，一眼司以見到永底有著許多黃石塊，流水經常地沖擊着石塊，它們的稜角，都被磨光了。小魚兒在石縫裏穿梭地游動。</p>
<p>在水的旁邊，有一所小石屋，它的牆　是用大石堆成，上面用薄石片充當磚瓦’前後兩個門，把門閉緊，微弱的光綫從石縫中　進。</p>
<p>在後門邊，裝着一個大的木齒輪，有一小部份，浸在水裏。屋裏排列着四具石碓。中間有橫木和木輪聯緊着。碓身是木質，　的一端是石製，右們的面前，有四個石日，日身理在地下。激流推着木輪在轉動，因此　連着厂碓依次地很有規律地在　着　裏的米粒，好像馬兒在取着糟裏的食物一樣。</p>
<p>這個「水碓」，是附近幾個山荘合力築造的。他們需要它經常來　米穀，尤其現在冬臘的時候，差不多家家都要　米粉，做　子，因此這個碓日夜都不停止。</p>
<p>小　的媽，也日夜不停地坐在碓旁，在簁着粉，這粉並不是自己的，是給人家篩的。她彷彿她一架篩米粉的工具一樣。</p>
<p>小　出世這一年，小　的爸就給保甲長抽去，經過訓練了一個時期，開到了前錢。從此以後就愈走愈遠，不消說一直沒有回來過。在勝利以後，曾接到他一封信，說快要回家了，可是事實上，仍舊沒有回來。</p>
<p>這幾年裏，她就幫同人家打雜來維持她和小　倆的生活。每到冬臘，遠去的人們都趕着回來過年，家家舂米粉，預備　家吃　子。她是沒有米粉　，她只是幫著人家　粉。—　滿一斗粉，取得一些　微的代價。</p>
<p>從有　裏　進來的光，照在小　媽媽一張乾枯焦黃的臉上，見著她的臉，決不會相信她祇是三十左右的人。身上穿了一件粉紅色的布棉襖。這是她的嫁時衣，已經穿了九年了，衣上面已經有了好多個破洞，黃黑色的棉花突出在洞口，　盼開著的失神的眼睛一樣。</p>
<p>她坐在地上，面前放一個大竹　，手裹拿了一個　子。把　粹的粗粉，盛在　子裏，手兒搖著，拍著，細粉從　孔裏落對　中。</p>
<p>她這樣不斷持篩著，己經有三天三夜沒有休息了。兩腿早已失去知覺，兩條手臂　痛得幾被鋸割一樣。但她還在　著、　著。颺起的粉，輕輕地爬上她的頭髮，爬上她的眉毛，……她的眉髮都變白了。</p>
<p>「今年你家裏預備做多少　子？」</p>
<p>「我家要做十幾籠，你家呢？」</p>
<p>「也差不多。你家有那幾種　心？」</p>
<p>「有　絲肉的，有棗泥的………」</p>
<p>「我們有豬油白糖的……」</p>
<p>小　媽聽了旁邊幾個女的在攀談著　子的事，　　下一日冷冷的</p>
<p>木輪在轉勸，發出吱阿吱阿的叫聲，好似在感　，在嘆息。</p>
<p>小　從從門跳著走進來，八九歲的孩子，個兒長得相常的高，穿了一件破舊的藍布棉袍，下擺短得很。</p>
<p>「媽媽，人做了一條船！」　叫新舊。</p>
<p>他的媽，兩眼盯著他望了片刻。只見他扁平的臉，扁平的鼻子，和　　的嘴唇，這和他的爸一模一樣。</p>
<p>「媽，你去瞧！」</p>
<p>「什麼船？」</p>
<p>「我把木盆做的一條船，我要坐在上面，去找爸爸回來吃　子呢！媽，我家做多少　子？」</p>
<p>「做許多許多！」小　的媽含糊地回答？</p>
<p>「我要吃一百個，二百個，爸爸吃得還要多！我要坐著船去找他回來！」</p>
<p>「你爸爸在江那邊，離開這兒很遠，你能我到嗎？」</p>
<p>「怎麼不能，我們後邊這條水，你不是說通江嗎，我坐在船上，只要過一條江，就能找到了！」小　越　越興奮。</p>
<p>「你還不認得你的爸呢？」—她的兩滴眼淚，滾到米紛　裏，變成兩顆滾　的粉珠。</p>
<p>「你不是說。爸的臉兒和我一樣嗎？」</p>
<p>「你爸爸在江那邊，已經有了老婆孩子，他不要你了！」她故意這麼說。</p>
<p>「不，江那邊，不太平，他不能來，你也不能去！」媽不忍心孩子　的哭出來，運忙改口說</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>夜深，水　已經停止動作。小　的媽，敵不住疲乏，倒在　角的稻草堆上，休息了一下。</p>
<p>她看見自己的丈夫回來了。衣上是濕濕的。</p>
<p>「你怎麼回來的？」她問。</p>
<p>「我坐了一條小船回來的！」丈夫回答。</p>
<p>她一笑，醒了轉來。旁邊睡的小孩在打鼾鼾，外面的流水聲，還在潺潺地響著。</p>

<h3>哈代的新研究</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>新近美國出了兩本關於英國文學家哈代（Thomas　Haroy）的書，這證明哈代的作品具有永久性，讀者對於他仍極注意。這兩本書都是談論哈代的小說的。席賽爾（Lord　Robert　Cecil）的「小設家之哈代」（Hardy　the　Novelist），題目已經限定了範圍。魏伯（Carl　J．Weber）的「哈代在美國」（Hardy　in　America）也著軍在散文方面，不大注重他的詩。</p>
<p>也許有人要說這是偏而不全的，那末哈代的意見正和他們相同，他自己就是蔑視他自己的長短篇小說的。一九一六年齊爾　（Harold　Child）預備寫哈代研究的時候，他暗示給齊爾德說：「請你把我的詩（Dynasts）當作我主要的作品，把我的小說當作我偶然的作品，道比相反的處理要好得多：事實上我寫小說只是被動的，逼不得已　去寫的，有些眼光銳利的批評家也慢慢地注意起我的詩來了。」</p>
<p>哈代是怎樣被逼去寫小說的呢？他在二十七歲上就想努力創作，覺得建築師事務所不能給他更多的機會。在倫軟，他　讀史文朋和雪萊，自己學寫了一些詩，印出以後，卻無人領教。於是他為了金錢面寫小說，投給　美倫公司等書店，但他們卻退還了他的稿子，還告訴他現今小說的趨勢，必須有複雜的情節。於是哈代為了要做小說商，便仔細研究當時流行的小設，特別是柯林斯（Wilkie　CollinB）的。他那確實的戲劇性，對於氛開氣和佈局的理解，緊湊的結構，都使得他的小說不同凡俗，早斯作即即擁有大量的讀者。</p>
<p>終於他被「康希爾」（Cornhill）的編者史締芬（Leslie　Stephen）所贊識，他的小說便一部一部的在這刊物上連續刊載，而他的收入和名譽也逐漸地增加。除「黛絲」與「裘德」外，哈代的小說可說無一不是為金錢而作的。美國：Harper雜誌寫了出英國版，拉哈代的小說撐塲面，當時哈　病重，掙扎在死亡綫上，還勉力替它寫了一個長　。這事件也記載在魏件的　　。</p>
<p>唐賽爾的論著有一優點，就是他不把哈代的哲學和作品來源佔去很多的篇幅。他還談到美國大學中研究哈代的情形，設來令人驚訝。過去七十五年中，英國只有一個教授諭到哈代的作品，但美國在過去四十年中，就已經有至少一百二十五篇論文談到哈代了。不幸這些論文大都注意哈代的哲學和作品的來源。其實哈代並不是一倘哲學家，他是一個藝術家，從他個人的人生經驗開展他的觀點的。的確，他在一八八〇年讀過叔本華和哈特曼（Hartmann），二十五年前還讀過阿斯齊洛士和沙福克里士的悲劇，使得他的作品帶有感傷的成分，但這並不曾改變他的基木觀點。</p>
<p>魏伯研究哈代己有多年的歷史，他寫「哈代在美國」是極為合適的。他詳敘哈代興美國出版者的關係，美國文評家對於他的批許，他在美國讀者　中的流行，美國大學研究哈代的熱誠，這些都記載得詳詳細細極便檢閱。</p>
<h3>村人像</h3>
<p>— 瓦特</p>
<p>瓦特（Wattean）是一六八四年生於近白耳義附近　Valenciennse小村的一個天才畫家。十九歲就成名，在巴里畫壇異常活躍了。他是當時所謂羅可司主義的重鎮，他初期的作品受了魯班斯影嚮，作品的氣氛較嚴肅，後期的作品，因其善於交辦貴族，生活於有　階級環境之中，反映於作品上的就是華麗，堂皇，悠閒，自在，成為當時的風俗畫。「村人像」是由前期進人後期的產物，成名的代表作，該作現藏羅佛客。（獅）</p>
<h3>楹聯閒話</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>翁松禪臨終自作　聯云；「朝聞道夕死可矣。今而後吾知勉去！」屬張季直書之。　直為松禪得意門生，於翁逝世時，亦挽以聯云：「公其如命何？可以為朱大興，乃並弗及李文正。　不足諭矣！何嘗有黨　傳，或者期之野　　。　朱大興名　，　文正，李文正名鴻　，與翁同為帝師，論學問翁勝於李，而翁　文恭，且　於李。故　直為乃師呼屬耳。</p>
<p>孫家　殘，門下王某為挽聯云：「是真理學，無理學之名，可憐一代清流。　　東海。唯古大臣，朋大臣之　，回憶廿年人直，長伴愚山。」東海指徐　軒，愚山謂翁松鴻，翁忌家　，　之　力、故云。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血171</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>身後，正是那位小孩體格，成人身量的小老虎。他因比較　　高了半個頭，似乎有些怕我們看見了他，所以把頭縮低了然，卻從　　秀發後面，露出了半雙眼睛，一瞬一折地。第三個人，站在兩個人身後，巍然　立，高出兩人，差不多半截身子，又粗又壯，站得挺直直地，　有些像一座寶塔。那就是「〇四」號，名申又文；據他說，他還是高麗的皇族旁枝。瞧他那一副高　壯顎。就知道他不易張嘴，無怪乎說起話來，那麼結結巴巴，半天一個字，聽了呌人替他着急。</p>
<p>「古先生·岳先生，你二位要出門？……我們來得不湊巧，不是嗎？」耀　的聲音是那麼脆而且甜，却又富於　　，不像　子那種嬌而簿；她同萍萍子，一個參日本的正京　，一個却是東北的道地高粱。問兩句話，就是兩　問句，這也東北老鄉的道地口氣。</p>
<p>「沒有事，沒有事」。　見　　　，也　上了些東北口音，」因為有些閒空，想到協和醫院去探探吳工程師。請進來坐吧，反正還早。」</p>
<p>耀　略略遲疑了一下，便回身摻着小老虎，一同跨進了屋子裏，「今天禮拜六。　院照例是兩點　放到四點，我同　弟　去了才回來。」</p>
<p>「對哪」，我趕忙應着；因鶴見一而　客進門的當口。聽見　　的話，正　空對我翻了一個白眼，意思說我把醫院開放的時間都鬧錯了。「是的，協和的規矩，星期一到五是下午五點；沒想到今天是星斯六，我　　飭簡直給這兩天的大　，　約有些糊塗了。」</p>
<p>「有　嗎？」鶴見看見「〇四」還　在門外，不進也不退。</p>
<p>「沒有什麼，剛才這裏打了電鈴。……」「〇四」一個字一頓。</p>
<p>「哦，取消了—本來是要事，現在不出去哪」，我代表鶴見給「〇四」把話說明白了。</p>
<p>「好傢伙」鶴見瞧着小老虎一路进屋子，就把他的一隻手抓起來，一边反覆检察，一边這麼　嘆：「竟比鐵叉子还厉害，哧溜一下，竟能插到人家肚子里去，……日本人是不會相信的；一定說是神話哩。……我真想瞧著你幾時干一下给我開開眼！」鶴見滿臉都堆着羨慕的神情。</p>
<p>「我不是　限看見，也有些信不及哩」。我想着那天晚土，小老　幹掉那個小日本副隊長，和汽車司機的一回事。</p>
<p>「還有比虎弟厲害些的哩」。耀　格格地笑着，「虎弟大怕的　子裏，有好幾個都能這一套，不算希奇。……前年　子裏還來了一位老人家，人是瘦得不像樣兒，他那指頭，竟連挺硬的右　，也能搗一個窟　洞兒，　呌人不信了。」</p>
<p>一　，天下之大，真是無奇不有！」　見有些感嘆，「不相信，　也是「夏虫不足以語冰」記咧……哦，想起來了，早起岳　　提到虎弟弟能夠空手　槍，那是值什麼手法……來來，試試給我瞧瞧，我要學這麼一手……」　見說着，立刻把小老虎拉到屋子中間，四五尺見方大一塊空地裏。</p>

<h3>戰後德國　陰盛陽衰　到處徵求丈夫</h3>
<p>— 路透社杜弗士著本報翻譯室特譯</p>
<p>「結婚是我一九四七年的最大願望，我是一個動人的女孩子，三十八歲了。平時愛好美術·音樂·戲劇和電影，…我現在需要一位四十歲的男子，把我擁在粗壯的手臂中，但他的高度不能超過五英尺五英寸。」</p>
<p>在德國的弗蘭克　德，愛惰是要藉廣告來做媒介的。</p>
<p>這城市是美國佔領軍的所在地。在十字街頭的告示牌上，貼著紅紅綠綠的廣告，除了招租和聘請以外，還有徵求丈夫和妻子的廣告。在德國的確是雌多雄少，陰陽的比例是六對一、因此，黴求丈夫的多，而黴求妻子卻很少很少。她們的條件注重封方的經濟狀況和他們與納粹的關係。</p>
<p>一顆心　一雙戒指</p>
<p>一張小巧，紛紅色的廣告。上面畫着兩個結在一起的同心和結婚戒，內容如次：「結婚是我在一九四七年的最大　望，我是一個動人的女孩子，三十八歲了。平時愛好美術普樂，戲劇和電影，我有很多錢財，同時也有一顆熱情的心。我現在需要一位四十歲的男子，把我擁在他那粗壯的手臂中，但是他的高度不能超過五英尺五英寸。</p>
<p>納粹黨員勿應徵</p>
<p>另一位比較覲實的婦女，寫了一篇簡短而中肯的文章：「我並不是一位美感皇后，但是我有一所飯店和很完備的家。請問願意做我商業上的合夥人和丈夫在那裏？納粹黨員請勿應徵，不滿四十歲的也請勿嘗試！」</p>
<p>除了　報式的廣告外，還有婚姻介紹所，也大登廣告。最近的一幅廣告說：「你要倣一位幸運的妻子嗎？我們可以替你介紹下面各位：（一）地主，四十八歲，（二）紡織商，三十六歲，（三）伙食店老　四十八歲，備有照片，請你們來賞光。」</p>
<p>中人不喜激在秋冬兩季結媽原因是房屋，食糧都缺少，在饑寒中焉能渡蜜月？在春光明媚的時候，物資雖然依舊缺乏，但是溫暖的心房，終於克服了現賓的頭腦。（七）</p>
<h3>靈芝草</h3>
<p>— 高明桂</p>
<p>之往大學假八仙橋青年會二樓舉行靈芝草助學展覽。該項芝草，係之大教授戚光宇在杭州秦望山情人橋畔發現移植於一瓦解中，瓦缽外國，繞以白　，置於一玻璃盒子內，定價五千萬元，現尚未為人購去。報載：「　芝草遠看與　茹無殊，細視則有別，其蓋未成　形，約缺園周的四分之一，莖生於一側，長約三寸，光澤如古銅幕，無紋痕，莖上有雲紋，色　而有鏽，如　出土之商　，蓋底為一層　　　，奇彩斑　，似已生甚久」。</p>
<p>該校之「發起　起」內，有　芝的考證云：「芝，木作之，　文象草生之形。　雜云：「芝　草，一歲三　」。王充論衡云：「芝生之　土，土氣和，故芝草生瑞」。芝　　形質大異，蘭而光　　毛，芝　　有教而背有光，　質柔而芝則堅　獨秀。…</p>
<p>按靈芝亦為　頰的一種，所　者　其他　頰皆寄生於其他植物，而靈乏則係獨立生長帶芝在生物學土、也並無多大價值，其名貴之處，僅在於搜覓不易，不可多得而已，根據傳說，靈芝係秉受日月精華，天天靈氣，孕育而成，生於深山僻壤之間年代久遠，能結成果實，形似嬰孩，名曰「何首烏」。千年以上的靈芝　，能幻成人，馬等形狀，產生靈感，能夠脫離本草而行動，修道的人，得而食之，可以「增加五百年道行」，「早成正果」。凡夫俗子食之，也可保水壽，長生不老。秦始皇命徐福至東瀛「蓬萊仙島」搜尋長生不老之方，即係此物，徐福以使命不能完成，回來必為始皇殺戮，乃終老　鄉。這種離奇怪　的傳奇，我們在神怪小說中常見之。</p>
<p>這類傳說，大概也只如齊東野　，並不可靠。否則，五千萬元不算貴，上海多的是有了數不濟的家私而難求不死之方的闊佬，一定會趨之若鶩。搶購而去。何況感光　所得的，僅是一株靈芝　草，而非成了精靈的「何首鳥」或「靈芝果」，無怪乎標價五千萬元，仍「無人問津」了。</p>
<p>可悲的是等待救濟的貧苦學生，這次展覽會的成績很差，義賣　　購定者也僅有數頓，一定有不少人大失所望。上海的豪客們對學術展覽並不感到興趣，要辦閃舉，只有掮出女人來號召，纔能使池們「慷慨解囊」，「滿意而歸」，說一聲：「這錢化得不冤」。主持者定能成績可觀，雙方「皆大歡喜」，得到圓滿的結果。人心如此，坪　何用！</p>
<p>我以為之江大學，當局把靈芝草的價格，定得未免大了一點，闊佬們既不願出五千萬元買一秣草回去，研究生物學的學者，又出不起這麼大的價格，辜負了靈然瑞草和無數等待助學金救濟的貧苦學生，只得「鎩羽而歸」了。</p>

<h3>男女新防錢</h3>
<p>— 葵園</p>
<p>讀「南京大血案」後</p>
<p>多歲的人，也許還會記得，小城市裏的戲院，書塲，曾經　紅紙書明「男賓席」「女賓席」以示「文明」，而「文明結親」大禮中，大抵也曾有此類點綴。十里洋塲的上海，其情形也大同小異，　閣千金或太太奶奶輩入戲院，照例是來包廂，至於男女雜坐，照穆不分的電車，則被　道者斥為不雅馴，換一句話說是頗涉下流的。蓋我們素重男女之大防，雖然　備起來總是罪在女人，但以「男濱席」「女賓席」而論則似頗為公允，免得「授受不親」起見，把他們分成兩個陣營，各守防地，實在是較為通　的。</p>
<p>倫理，男女賓席僅在大庭廣眾之　。離開此處，就不管了。所以其辦法也不見得如何圓滿。不過我先前曾經懷疑過所謂「大防」是怎麼一回事，及至一發現防地　，才稍稍悟道：「原來如此。</p>
<p>惜乎這種防地制度，歷年已頗為衰落，我看上海是沒有了，恕我陋見，不知鄉村或內地如何？這實在是頗為危險的。</p>
<p>先前曾有人倡導，在上海游泳池中隔以木板，男女分泳，這水板當然是一道防綫。然而世界究竟不是游泳池，如何可以到處攔木板呢？結果似乎是游泳池中還是仍然沒有攔木板。憂世者雖然心長，無如積重難返，看到今天暈步田地，實在已經破費周章了。</p>
<p>還有一層，所謂「大防」焉者，是男的防女的？還是女的防男的？抑是雙方互防呢？也是歷來疏於研究的問題。</p>
<p>一個笑話</p>
<p>記得有過這樣一個笑話：有陌生男女兩人一同旅行，晚間共投客店，但僅有一個單鋪房間，男的說：「我們就睡在一張床上吧」，女的說：「這怎麼行！」男的說：「不要緊，我們各人睡一條被呢，既」入睡，國的忽然越界，女的說：「不是你說隔着一條被嗎？」男的說：「不要緊，我們還隔着衣服哩。」</p>
<p>由此看來防　問題，實在太微妙，也太難研究了。不過至此地步，倘若論大防，則女的須要大防了。以中國國情論，　是在女人的，因此使我想到巴黎克勒尼大博物館中所陳列的保險帶。其開關有如大力士顯本領時所穿的短褲，不渦這是以金屬做成，說得更實在些，則是金屬做成的月輕帶，一直拉到臀部，前綫各開兩孔，孔　有件多鋸齒。這是歐洲中古世紀的名物，如果熱心愛國的朋友，逢到歐洲人來取笑我們的小腳或別的什麼之　時，大可提着這類東西去指其鼻子報復的。</p>
<p>這件東西的好處，說法是在不比普通褲子的，而是用鎖鎖住在腹際。這條金屬的工事當然十分堅固，不過鑰匙不能執在女人手裏，否則便會犯通敵嫌疑，一旦工事雖仍穩固，而防地已經失守，有　「火防」的原則，實是萬萬不安的。</p>
<p>如果工　家稍能設計一下，恐怕也不難設計一種東西，與這保險帶媲美，專門適用於男士的。而把所有的鑰匙，交給社會素受人望而一向搖頭　氣的人物，或者是竟用中國的新法，選舉一個全國性的委員會出來掌握，那　男女之大防問題，解決起來便十分實際。如果再辦得積極一點，請這個委員會來懸賞一下，徵求一種發明，像偽滿時代的東北人必須穿協和服一樣，而把所有的男女都穿上一種發明的——就　稱為「大防服」吧，這服裝用金屬或別的什麼織成，內藏鋼刺，　在有一種磁性，倘若男的穿了，碰到女人，便會因磁性關係週身一齊冒比鋼刺來；女的見了男的也是一樣。而衣服係用鎖鎖住，鑰匙也由委會員或什麼的管理，這樣雙重的工事，是男的防女的也吧，女的防男的也吧，雙方互防也吧，就不成問題了。</p>
<p>在「物欲橫流」的今日，我也不能免俗而信仰唯物論，至於提倡什麼道德之類，終是感到有些微妙，無從捉摸。如果說男女應該大防，我想這種唯物的辦法未必沒有意思吧？</p>
<p>事關倫常</p>
<p>讀廿六月申報，有南京中央社電，說是舊歷新正，發生了「驚人大血案」血案而大，並且驚人，比之在戰塲上互相大殺又如何呢？於是不得不　下去了。「……李年輕好色，對空房獨守之舅母，早在非非之想，事發之晚十時許，李友在另房，李乃乘機入死者之寢室，強圖行奸，當遭張氏拒絕，一時惱羨成怒、竟持菜刀將張氏砍成重傷，外室人聞聲趕至，李猶呆立　中，乃為警方抵押，經三日偵訊，始供認圖姦不遂殺人不諱。」而張氏已在「事發後當夜不治身死。」「中央日報　此特於今日刊出社論，呼　「建立新的男女之防」，以正社會倫常」云。也就可見「男女之防」</p>
<p>不知道這位李延昌先生今年多大年紀了，我看他今後這一生大約是就此完結了呢？他向他的舅母掄刀砍去，現在則是別的人來掄刀砍他了。這回講的是倫常，不見得是罪在女人了。噫，男女之防。怎麼辦呢？還是道德？</p>
<h3>外籍幸運兒第二「王弟弟」</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>失事鄂西的申航一四五號客機上，唯一脫險的是一個十六個月的嬰兒保爾維克美國傳教士的幼兒。中航以專機把他運返上海以後，送到宏恩醫院去治療，這個消息哄動上海新聞界，許多記者都去宏恩醫院拍攝保爾的照片。結果都嘗了閉門羹。但最後，終於給美國紐約時報駐滬攝影記者安力生拍了僅有的一張。</p>
<p>保爾維克在滬，由美國聯合教會辦事處照應，　愈以後，就依照保勻祖父母的意思，送返美國教養。</p>
<p>小保爾和另一位王弟弟，都是大難不死，他們未來的成就，倒是頗　興趣的。</p>
<h3>男女有別</h3>
<p>— 更新</p>
<p>一個女人刮洋火的時候是朝外刮，男人則向着他自己刮，當一個女人察看她的手指甲時，她張開手掌去看整個手，男人則將他的手指屈起來，專看看指甲。一個女人先將房間內周視一遍，然後才去注視某個角落，男人則直接朝那個角落裏望去。女人喝水的時候，眼睛總是朝着站在她　對面的人，男人則望着他杯子內的水。</p>

<p>物價甫到「關」，即「出關」，又「叩關」；何其急促？</p>
<p>小民的生活，度「難關」。叫「犯關」；性命「交關」！</p>

<h3>National Army in Southern Shandong Splits Forces for a Combined Encirclement, Pressing Near Linyi and Reaching the Outskirts of Yixian County, Chen Yi Trapped in a Disadvantageous Defensive Position</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army advancing north from Tancheng in Southern Shandong is now less than 15 kilometers from Linyi. Linyi is expected to fall imminently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army in Southern Shandong reached the outskirts of Yixian County on the 5th. The Communist troops inside the city were in a state of panic, preparing to retreat. The National Army at Yutai recovered Guting Town on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] After the National Army's Huo Shouyi unit recovered Laiwu City on the 4th, the Communist troops who had fled south of the city and to its flanks launched a counterattack from three directions towards the outskirts of the city starting on the 5th. Fighting continued until late at night.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Fierce battles have been raging for days along the Longhai Railway in areas such as Xiaoba and Liuhe. On the 6th, the Communist troops completely collapsed and are retreating northwest towards Shangqiu, reorganizing around Loulou, seemingly preparing to attack Shangqiu. South of the Yuxinan Railway, there has been considerable movement of Communist troops, but no significant signs of advance as of yet. Yanzhuang, east of Laiwu in Southern Shandong, was recovered on the 6th, and the Communist troops retreated towards Mengyin in Jiawu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The Communist 79th and 2nd Divisions, totaling over 30,000 men, sneaked to Guanqiao and Duweizi, north of Lincheng, on the 4th, threatening to attack Lincheng.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 6th] According to air force reconnaissance, a small number of Communist troops are in Taixian County, planning to transport supplies north, with most troops stationed in the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The Communist Yang Yong unit, with 4,000 to 5,000 men, captured Zhou, 30 li northeast of Dangshan, on the night of the 4th. Furthermore, the Communist Liu Bocheng unit of over 10,000 men, which captured Hao County on the morning of the 3rd, continued to flee east on the 5th, attempting to attack Xiayi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] The Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, Wang Ziming, recently told reporters regarding the situation in the Central Plains: Zhengzhou's defense is solid, and the rumors of the fall of Kaifeng are unfounded. Judging from the current situation, it will be extremely difficult for the Communist troops to succeed in attacking Xuzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] Because National Army reinforcements have arrived in the outskirts of Jinan, Qihé and Yancheng are secure. From 11 PM on the 5th to dawn on the 6th, the Communist troops attacked the northwestern suburbs of Qihé. After a night of fierce fighting, the Communist troops were finally repelled. The main force of the Communist troops, the 7th and 11th Divisions under Xie, are gathering near the outer Jinan regiment, claiming they will attack Jinan at the end of the first lunar month, but most of them have recently disappeared. It is said that they have gone to Southern Shandong to participate in the war, and the talk of attacking Jinan is just a show of force.</p>
<h3>Pacification Work Completed in Southern Shandong, National Army Set to Converge in Three Routes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The National Army is now advancing directly into Linyi in three routes. The decisive battle in Southern Shandong is imminent. The southern assault force, composed of elite National Army troops, is said to have crossed Lijiazhuang, and its vanguard has reached Xibailinzhuang, six miles south of Linyi. The eastern assault force, led by Hao, has already crossed the Yi River and joined the southern force. The northern force, Wang Yaowu's troops advancing south along the Jiaoji Railway, is making rapid progress and has recently captured Laiwu. Aware of the National Army's urgency, the Communist troops in Linyi are accelerating their withdrawal from the urban area. The vanguard, three miles outside Linyi, is now visible, along with large fires and explosions in the city.</p>
<p>According to frontline reports, the Communist troops in Southern Shandong are still engaging in positional warfare, while retreating into the mountains to implement guerrilla warfare in order to impede the National Army's advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army has completed the initial pacification work in Southern Shandong, and the annihilation of Liu Bocheng's three columns on the border of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui has shattered the Communist troops' attempt to encircle Xuzhou. What will follow is not the Xuzhou battle imagined by Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, but the Southern Shandong battle. Because Liu Bocheng's 2nd, 6th, and 7th columns were severely attacked by the National Army near Shangqiu and Hao County and are fleeing for reorganization, they are no longer able to support Chen Yi. At the same time, Chen Yi is in a disadvantageous defensive position. How he will struggle is now a matter of close attention from all parties here. Based on reasonable judgment, Chen Yi will choose one of the following paths: (1) lead his troops to surrender to the government; (2) engage in a desperate battle with the National Army in Linyi; (3) flee to the mountains; (4) retreat to Jiaodong; (5) cross the Jinpu Railway and join Liu Bocheng; (6) flee back to Northern Jiangsu. Among these, the third possibility is more likely, and the first possibility has a partial chance of realization. Chen Yi is a well-established figure among the Communist troops (referring to commanders and soldiers). It is widely believed that the National Army's second phase of offensive in Southern Shandong will surely defeat him. The Communist Party's belief in "violence is omnipotent" will also be shaken.</p>
<h3>War Clouds Looming Over the Pingbao Section, Communist Troops Begin Attacking Xushui and Laiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The focus of the war on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has shifted from the Baoshi section to the Pingbao section, with both sides actively preparing for battle. The opportunity for war seems to have matured. The main force of the Communist troops, which captured Wangdu, Dingxian, and Xinle, are concentrating around Mancheng, Xushui, and Yixian. It is also rumored that ten regiments of Communist regular army and a considerable number of militia have been discovered on the east bank of the Daqing River, west of Gu'an. Over 4,000 have been discovered southwest of Liulihe. Military sources say that since the 4th, Communist troops near Xushui and Laiyuan have begun attacking simultaneously, with forces reaching tens of thousands of men, particularly in the tense situation in Xushui. The National Army is in a favorable position. Military transportation is busy on both the Beining and Pinghan lines. Passenger trains to and from Pingjin have been suspended this afternoon. The commander of the 34th Army Group, Li Wen, is now stationed between Bao and Xu. Five sections of the Pingbao road between Songlin Dian and Gaobeidian were destroyed last night, but it did not affect traffic. Judging from this situation, it is possible that a battle will be fought north of Bao before re-opening the Bao-Shi transportation route.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Baoding, 6th: With war clouds looming, the 200,000 citizens of Baoding are under serious threat.

A unit of over 1,000 Communist troops recently detoured through Wafangdian, north of the old Fuzhou area, reaching the Miaolinggou area east of the China Changchun Railway. The National Army's 6th Army Corps is dispatching troops to intercept them. The China Changchun Railway has been opened to traffic, but it was sabotaged by Communist troops ambushing along the roadside at Pulandian.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] Road workers are rushing to repair the northern section of the China Changchun Railway towards Dehui, with plans to eventually extend it to the Songhua River.

Ye Jianying and his Chief of Staff Xue Zizheng and other senior officials attended. After Ye entered, he was immediately surrounded by reporters. The important questions and answers are recorded as follows: (1) Question: What are your thoughts on the dissolution of the Executive Headquarters? Answer: The Executive Headquarters has not done much work in the past six months, so it is right to cancel it, but it is a pity that the Executive Headquarters has not completed its mission. (2) Question: When you write your memoirs in the future, do you think the past year was a waste or did it have its price? Answer: It educated me, and it also educated the people. (3) Question: The CPC has always advocated the withdrawal of American troops from China. Now that the American troops have been ordered to withdraw, is the CPC satisfied? Answer: Listen to what they say and watch what they do. Let's watch slowly. (4) Question: If Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union jointly mediate in the future, will the CPC welcome it? Answer: It is best for the Chinese people to solve their own problems. If other countries help China solve problems instead of managing China, and if their methods are in line with the interests of the people, of course, it should also be considered. The atmosphere at today's meeting was quite harmonious. Cai Wenzhi and Ye Jianying had a wonderful dialogue. Cai said: "Thank you for your help to me over the past year." Ye said: "Although our positions are different, our personal friendship is very good. I admire your talent and promise." After finishing, they toasted and drank together, and the party ended in joy. Cai will host a farewell party for Gillem and Ye Jianying again at his private residence on the 8th.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, February 6] Tani Hisao, the main perpetrator of the Nanjing Massacre, has been on public trial at the Lixingshe since 2:00 PM on the 6th. The trial is scheduled to last for three days. In addition to questioning Tani on this day, American witnesses Professor Jin Da, Smith and Pace, Xu Chuanyin, Vice President of the Red Swastika Society, Japanese witness Ogasawara Ao, and victims or their family members were summoned to testify. The trial lasted for four hours. At 6:00 PM, massacre films were shown until 6:20 PM. The court was set up in the auditorium of the Lixingshe, and 1,300 audience passes were issued. Although the audience was very crowded, the order was very good. Mr. and Mrs. Wang Chonghui and Wang Shijie were present as spectators. At 2:00 PM, Court President Shi Meiyu and his party arrived in court. Soon, Tani was escorted to court, wearing a yellow woolen military uniform, yellow leather shoes, a light gray woolen hat, and a black woolen overcoat, carrying a leather bag. He was short and fat, with a sallow complexion and a fleshy face. More than 100 family members of the victims appeared in court. First, the Court President asked Tani about his age and place of origin. Then, Prosecutor Chen Guang read out the indictment, which was then translated into Japanese by the interpreter. Tani listened intently. Then, the prosecutor added the following explanations: (1) In terms of time, the massacre period lasted for several months, and the indictment only listed the 8th and 9th. (2) In terms of area, the massacre range was as wide as inside and outside the city, and the indictment only mentioned a corner of Zhonghua Gate. (3) In terms of numbers, the victims of the massacre numbered more than 400,000, and the indictment only mentioned more than 40,000. His crimes also included: 1. Destruction of property, 2. Robbery, 3. Rape. One woman was raped 37 times and then killed. Some women were killed with more than 30 knives on their faces for refusing to be raped.

After the prosecutor's explanation, the Court President said: "The defendant participated in the invasion war and participated in the massacre, which constitutes a war crime in violation of Articles 23, 46, and 47 of the Hague Convention, a crime against humanity, and a crime against peace. The number of massacre crimes committed, as investigated by the Municipal Council, is 2,784 cases." Then, he asked about his experience and participation in the invasion of China. Regarding the Nanjing Massacre, he asked whether the responsibility should be placed on the military headquarters or the Japanese Emperor. Tani sophistically argued: "I am a soldier and only know how to obey orders. I claim to be unaware of national policies." He also falsely claimed that he personally advocated East Asian peace and Sino-Japanese friendship. Regarding the massacre, Tani said: "I can assert that my subordinates would never do such a thing." Then, the Court President instructed to display the skeletons excavated from Yuhuatai in front of the trial stage, and the forensic doctor explained the examination process and provided a list of explanations. Tani argued: "According to the listed burial time, it was December 22 of that year, and my troops had already been transferred." Then, Xu Chuanyin, Vice President of the Red Swastika Society, testified about the situation at the time and said: "The listed 22nd is not the date of the killing, but the date of burial and filling out the form." Then, he explained the situation of corpses all over the city at that time and the situation of his relatives and friends being killed in Xiaohuowa Lane. Tani immediately argued: "It is not within my defense zone and I cannot be held responsible." Then, American witnesses Smith and Pace explained the various atrocities they witnessed in Nanjing that year. Yao Jialong, a family member of the victim, stated that the enemy soldiers killed his wife and three children at the time, and he himself was also shot. Then, the victim Chen Ergu was summoned to the court. The court asked, "Were you raped by the Japanese that year?" Chen angrily replied loudly, "Yes." Asked, "How many people?" Chen replied, "Two people." Asked, "Did both people rape you?" Answered "Yes". And said: "The Japanese used guns to threaten, there was no way to resist." At this point, Tani sophistically claimed: "Where is the location?" The Court President said: "Within your defense zone." Tani had no words. Finally, Japanese man Ogasawara Ao testified for him, using cunning and empty excuses. At 6:00 PM, the trial ended, and the Court President announced that the trial would continue on the 7th. After a short break, a film about the massacre was shown so that Tani could watch it in court. The audience witnessed the horrific scenes and were filled with outrage. When Tani was escorted back, they shouted "Shoot him!" "Shoot him!"</p>

<h3>Editorial: Starting with the Complaints of American Businesses</h3>
<p>Since the 2nd of this month, American news agencies have repeatedly reported that American businesses in China are complaining to the State Department about being squeezed out and discriminated against in their business dealings in China. Subsequently, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department officially stated that the U.S. authorities are considering the complaints raised by American businesses in China, and the U.S. Embassy in China is also closely monitoring the situation. The Shanghai-based "North China Daily News" published an editorial yesterday, also stating that foreign businesses in China are suffering from exclusion and discrimination, and not just American businesses. Merchants from other countries in China also feel deeply uneasy about the current trend of China's trade policy. We believe that this issue is not only related to China's foreign trade, but also has a significant impact on China's financial economy, and we must clarify it to dispel the concerns of merchants from various countries in China, so as to correct international perception.</p>
<p>We cannot oppose the United States' efforts to restore post-war international trade freedom in principle. However, our country is an economically backward country, and all industries cannot be called industrialized. In order to develop our country's industry, we must adopt the so-called "moderate protection" measures. Because economically backward countries cannot stand on an equal footing with economically developed countries. If we insist on freedom, equality, reciprocity, and mutual benefit, it will only benefit economically developed countries. This is the cornerstone of our country's foreign trade policy. I remember that when the United Nations Economic and Social Council held a preparatory meeting on international trade and employment in London on October 15 last year, the Chinese representative, Dr. Jin Wensi, also said this, and hoped that the representatives of all countries attending the meeting could put forward active and specific suggestions so that economically less developed countries can complete their industrialization tasks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Chinese government announced the revised import and export trade measures on November 17 last year, which is based on this meaning. The specific measures are five: (1) General control, adopting a licensing system for all imported goods; (2) Prohibiting unnecessary imports; (3) Adopting a quota system for goods allowed to be imported; (4) Allowing priority import for very needed imported goods; (5) Treating importers equally, regardless of whether they are government or private, without discrimination. Therefore, when this method began to be implemented, it was not only unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, but also the kind merchants of various countries in China also expressed sympathy and understanding for the difficulties of the Chinese authorities having to adopt this "moderate protection" method, and were willing to sincerely abide by this method. However, less than three months after this method was implemented, American businessmen in China filed complaints with their government, and the Shanghai-based "North China Daily News" also called this "a bad policy," which makes us feel regret.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from United Press International in New York on the 2nd, the reasons for the complaints of American businessmen in China to the State Department can be analyzed as follows: (1) American business representatives in China have not been able to obtain import licenses for goods beyond the allotted amount, while general semi-official companies can still obtain import licenses by using their political connections; (2) These semi-official companies use political relations and other pressures to force manufacturers to hand over their agency accounts to them; and pre-empt all production plans set by American companies months or even years ago; (3) Since the revised import and export trade measures were promulgated on November 17 last year, American businessmen have not been able to obtain import licenses for goods worth more than US$5,000, so that the heavy industrial equipment urgently needed for China's reconstruction, even though orders have been placed for eighteen months, cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>Regarding the complaints of American businessmen in China, even before it has been verified, we should adopt the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have made them and being vigilant if we have not," and first conduct a self-examination to see if there are any facts as stated in the American businessmen's complaints. Because the facts presented by the United States, even if weighed against the revised import and export trade measures promulgated by our government, are a distressing illegal act, and the government should bear the responsibility for thorough investigation and correction! Isn't it clearly stipulated in the measures that government and private merchants should be treated equally? However, we must also point out to the United States and other countries' merchants in China that even if the reasons for the American businessmen's complaints to their government are verified, it is only the mismanagement of the competent authorities, not the irrationality of the revised import and export trade measures. This point must be clarified.</p>
<p>Therefore, standing from the people's position, our attitude towards this issue is very simple: on the one hand, we hope that the Chinese government will strive for fairness in implementing the revised import and export trade measures, especially for industrial and commercial organizations operated or managed by the government. No preferential treatment should be given, and all procedures should be the same as those for private industrial and commercial organizations, so as to ensure equal opportunities and free competition, so as to avoid causing dissatisfaction among the latter. As the saying goes, "If there is injustice, there will be a cry." The American businessmen's complaints to their government are by no means unfounded. At the same time, we also hope that foreign businessmen in China should broaden their horizons, first recognize the goods that China urgently needs at present, and then import the goods that China urgently needs, and never only know how to covet immediate interests and ignore the needs of China's national economy and people's livelihood. We want foreign businessmen to understand that the future of trade with China is entirely based on China's domestic prosperity. If they only know how to come to China to make profits but do not know how to cultivate the purchasing power of the Chinese people, then there is little bright future for trade with China. Frankly speaking, the crisis of foreign trade in China does not lie in being excluded and discriminated against, but in the dumping of foreign goods that make the Chinese people poor and financially exhausted, which is most worthy of concern. It is hoped that all countries' merchants in China can consider this.</p>
<p>Correction: In the seventh line of the third paragraph of the editorial on the 5th of this month, "one hundred and fourteen times" is a mistake for two point one four times, especially corrected.</p>
<h3>The Disaster Situation in Hunan and Guangxi is Tragic: Guilin is Almost a Dead City</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] A reporter from the Central News Agency traveled south by plane on the 30th of last month and visited Guangzhou, Liuzhou, and Guilin. Post-war South China is no longer what it used to be. In the year and a half since then, due to the impact of economic difficulties, the market is no longer as prosperous as before the war, especially in Liuzhou and Guilin. To this day, only two or three out of ten have been restored. Liuzhou has better conditions due to waterway transportation, and there is a little commercial exchange. Guilin has become almost a dead city due to the loss of transportation connections. Disaster victims in Guangxi are scattered in the countryside. Recently, thanks to the relief efforts of the Administrative Relief Committee, they have勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關 barely survived the difficulties, but there is a feeling that there are too many monks and not enough porridge. It is believed that a major tragic event may be staged again in February and March this year, when the crops are not yet ready for harvest. The disaster situation in Hunan and Guangxi provinces is the most serious, and we cannot ignore it. In Guangzhou, since Mayor Ouyang Ju took office, monthly income and expenditure have been able to offset each other. Recently, he borrowed 10 billion yuan from the four banks to build roads, and construction has begun actively.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Ice Blocks as Big as Mountains: Zhongmu Iron Bridge Destroyed: Bianxin Branch Line of Longhai Railway to be Re-Paved and Bridged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kaifeng Dispatch] The Zhongmu Bridge on the Longhai Railway was suddenly destroyed on the evening of January 27 due to the exceptionally cold weather and the freezing of the Yellow River. The ice blocks were as big as mountain peaks. Stations such as Xiaoba and Liuhe on the eastern section were also destroyed by the Communist army, resulting in the suspension of east-west trains. The railway authorities noted that the Bianxin branch line had been dismantled due to the diversion of water from the Yellow River breach. Now, there is not much water in the old course, and the Zhongmu River is turbulent, making the bridge difficult to repair. Therefore, it was decided to build a temporary bridge on the old course of the Yellow River at Damazhuang on the Bianxin branch line and re-lay the rails on the branch line to avoid interrupting the traffic on the western section. Materials are being prepared and construction will begin soon.</p>

<h3>More Than 1,000 American Sheep Will Be Bred in Haining</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Haining Dispatch] More than 1,000 American sheep allocated to our country by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will arrive in Shanghai soon. In order to find a suitable area for breeding, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry designated that it must be within the counties of Jiaxing Prefecture to facilitate production and transportation. Therefore, it sent personnel to Xiaqian a few days ago. The Agricultural Extension Institute immediately sent personnel to accompany them to inspect the vast public lands in this county. A reporter visited after hearing the news and was told that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry intends to find a field with an area of more than 2,000 mu for long-term sheep breeding, and the expenses and sheep sheds will be directly allocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. This time, it is believed that the people of this county originally used sheep breeding as a sideline, but the poor breed quality resulted in low wool production. In the inspection area in this county, one is the coastal area of Yanguan, Donghu Wengbu, and the other is Dongshan in Xiashi. The former has inconvenient transportation and the area is not suitable. The latter has more green grass, and the environment and transportation are particularly suitable, and the area is vast. It will be reported that the area will be used to prepare for development, and another survey will be conducted in Xiaqian.</p>
<h3>Bandits Cooperate Internally and Externally: Zhangyan Security Team Attacked: Weapons Confiscated Have Been Recovered in Part</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinshan Dispatch] Gao Keming, the captain of the first security squadron stationed in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, was invited to a dinner by Zhu Pingjun, a local resident of the town, at about 9 p.m. on the 2nd of this month. Just as he was drinking, gunshots were suddenly heard. The captain saw that the situation was not good and immediately returned to the squadron headquarters, where he saw more than a dozen bandits, each holding long and short weapons, surrounding the area and shouting to stop him from advancing. Unexpectedly, the newly recruited soldier in the team (from Anhui) also joined the bandits, using a machine gun to blindly fire. Captain Gao immediately fought back. For a time, gunshots rang out, and the residents of the entire town were panicked. However, because they were outnumbered, one soldier was killed and two were injured by the bandits. A light machine gun, 16 rifles, and a Mauser pistol were seized, and a Shu Wanhua jewelry store was robbed before they fled in a hurry. At this time, the order was in chaos, and reinforcements could not arrive in time. Captain Gao immediately telegraphed the Jinshan County Government to send a team to assist in the suppression.

<h3>Mechanical Land Reclamation Planned by the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Committee, Trial Implementation in Four Locations Including Jianqiao</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 5th] The Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Committee, in order to increase grain production in the province, previously planned to use mechanical agricultural tools allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to reclaim wasteland, starting with Hangzhou City. Subsequently, Zhao Wu, an agricultural technician from the branch, along with Mao Gen and other agricultural specialists from UNRRA, surveyed four locations: Jianqiao, Songmuchang, Lixi Lake, and Xixing, and found them to be worthy of reclamation. The branch has now drafted a plan to train technicians and organize a tractor-cultivated area in the spring of this year to implement land reclamation. Once this plan is realized, it can reduce labor costs by nine-tenths.</p>

<h3>Atomic Control and Disarmament Issues US and USSR Gradually Move Towards Compromise Both Sides Agree to Use the French Proposal as a Basis for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: The UN Security Council Six-Nation Committee has agreed that the Security Council will immediately and simultaneously study both the general disarmament and atomic energy control proposals. The Six-Nation Committee held a closed-door meeting today to draft disarmament procedures, accepting the first two points of the French compromise proposal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: There has been a compromise between the US and the USSR, which has begun to break the current deadlock in the Security Council on disarmament procedures. Representatives from the US and the USSR have reached a consensus on all points, causing disagreement among the Six-Nation Committee on the method of handling disarmament. The US representative, Austin, believes that it should be immediately stated that the work of the Disarmament Committee does not conflict with the work of the UN Atomic Control Committee. The Soviet representative opposed, believing that this statement was unnecessary.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 5th] The UN Security Council Six-Nation Committee held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the disarmament issue. It is reported that representatives from the US and the USSR have abandoned the points of intense debate and accepted the French compromise proposal. France proposed the establishment of a Disarmament Committee to submit various proposals to the Security Council, and suggested that the Security Council should quickly discuss the report of the Atomic Energy Committee to instruct the Atomic Energy Committee to start new work. During the meeting, the US representative, Austin, apparently abandoned the request to establish a subcommittee to draft the rules of procedure for the Disarmament Committee. Austin frequently left the meeting to make phone calls, once making an urgent call to Washington. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, generally accepted the French proposal, only opposing the point that the Security Council should order the Military Staff Committee to submit a report within three months, which France immediately cancelled. The only point that remains to be resolved is the US request for a special provision that the work of the Disarmament Committee should not hinder the work of the Atomic Energy Committee.</p>
<h3>Marshall Submits 27 Proposals to Congress Emphasizes Relief Plan After UNRRA Ends</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] Secretary of State Marshall has sent a letter to Senate Speaker Vandenberg, listing the continued relief plan after the end of UNRRA as the top priority among the several important matters submitted by the State Department to Congress. President Truman had previously informed Congress that he would request Congress to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars for the continued relief of other countries, especially Italy, Austria, and Greece. Marshall listed the ratification of the peace treaties with the five countries as the second priority, and the US joining the International Refugee Organization as the third priority. The letter lists a total of 27 items, of which 10 are considered important. Important items also include allowing refugees to enter the United States, developing cultural relations outside the Western Hemisphere, donating the UN headquarters site, and exempting it from taxes. Vandenberg told reporters: The United States will take over some of the relief work from UNRRA to avoid famine. Vandenberg also said: He believes that no one is willing to shirk this responsibility.</p>
<p>US Relief Plan is Very Unfavorable to China</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 5th] A representative from the UNRRA headquarters told this agency this month that some Chinese officials believe that under the European food relief plan led by the United States, China has become the main victim. The plan will be announced by UNRRA Director-General Rooks this week and proposes to allocate 35 million US dollars for the relief of European food after the end of UNRRA. The total amount of funds consists of 4 million US dollars in UNRRA deposits, 6 million dollars taken from the Czech Republic's allocation, and 25 million US dollars in "unused funds" from other countries. The 15 million US dollars under China's name are also within the "unused funds." Therefore, the relief funds for China before the end of June will inevitably be reduced by 15 million US dollars. It is said that this will inevitably cause fierce disputes in the UNRRA Central Committee, so this plan is unlikely to be approved.</p>
<p>Pepper Criticizes Republican Policies Again</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 5th] US Democratic Senator Pepper delivered a speech in the Senate today, fiercely criticizing the Republican Party's foreign policy.

<p>[Reuters London, 5th] Representatives of the four major powers discussed the French and Soviet procedural proposals today, debating for a long time on the definition of so-called "countries directly related to the German issue." The Soviet representative, Gusev, suggested that all neighboring countries that had been occupied by Germany, or even if they were not neighboring countries but had been occupied by Germany, should be considered directly related countries. The British representative, Strang, said that those who decided to declare war on Germany in 1939 without being attacked should be considered directly related to the German issue. Tomorrow, the representatives will discuss the draft report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference drafted by the drafting committee.</p>
<h3>British Ultimatum Rejected by Jewish Leaders Underground Forces Decide to Fight Britain to the End</h3>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem, 5th] Jewish leaders decided here today to authorize the Executive Committee of the Jewish National Council to formally reject the British ultimatum demanding joint search for terrorists.

<h3>Truman Raises the Issue of Presidential Succession Again</h3>
<p>[US Information Service Washington, 5th] President Truman today again advocated changing the current law regarding presidential succession to better "conform to the basic concept of civil government." The President sent identical letters to Senate President Vandenberg and House Speaker Martin, reiterating the recommendation he made to Congress in June 1945: that if the elected President and Vice President die, the Speaker of the House should be the first successor. If there is no Speaker, or if the Speaker is not qualified, the President of the Senate should temporarily act as President until a qualified Speaker of the House is elected. Soon after President Truman first made this recommendation, the House of Representatives passed a bill with this provision, but it failed to pass in the Senate.</p>

In this expanded new area, there are eight mountain peaks and a large bay discovered in the Roosevelt Sea. The above discoveries were made after 25 flight sorties by the expedition's East and West Route mobile units and are of great importance in geography. Byrd also summarized the progress of the expedition: "There are vast and rich resources here that can be explored."</p>
<h3>Eggs Standing Up</h3>
<p>Failed to Realize in Korea</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: The theory of eggs standing up cannot be realized in Korea. According to the US Army organ report, "This newspaper bought two eggs for 30 won. After repeated tests, they could not stand up straight. Therefore, it is not miraculous. But there is another thing that is very miraculous: the two eggs disappeared the next day. It is unknown whether they were stolen or walked away by themselves."</p>
<h3>Soviet General Headquarters Issues Fifth Demobilization Order Since the War</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 5th] The Soviet General Headquarters today issued the fifth demobilization order since the war, which is another step in the Soviet Union's return to peacetime life and providing manpower for agriculture and industry. The new demobilization order will take effect from March to June this year, and the number of demobilized personnel seems to be more than the previous one. The Soviet Union, like other countries, had demobilized older soldiers and conscripted younger ones. But there are now clear signs that a large number of Soviet young people of military age have not been conscripted into the army since the war, but have instead joined factories or engaged in civilian professional work. It is difficult to say how many troops the Soviet Union has left after this demobilization. Premier Stalin announced last October that the Soviet Union had 60 divisions stationed abroad. He also said that after the fourth demobilization, the number of troops stationed in Europe would be reduced to 40 divisions. These figures do not include the number of domestic demobilized personnel and the number of troops stationed in the East. It is expected that if the international situation is calm, this demobilization order is not the last one, because demobilization is not only the wish of the Soviet Union, but also an urgent need.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Anti-Soviet Movement Not Supported by British Labour Party Executive Committee Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 5th Special Dispatch] The British Labour Party Executive Committee has issued instructions to party members not to support the European Federation movement recently launched in London by Churchill. Labour Party Secretary-General Philippe explained this decision, saying that the future and progress of European peace depend on the success of the United Nations, so all depend on strengthening friendly cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Churchill has apparently excluded the Soviet Union from the European Federation plan. This is the policy of the committee led by Churchill. This policy, whether it is justified or not, can be interpreted as aiming to eliminate Soviet influence in Europe.</p>

<h3>Poland Under Soviet Control</h3>
<p>— Translated by this newspaper's research department</p>
<p>Recently, the U.S. State Department issued a formal statement condemning the provisional government of Poland, believing that the recent general election held in Poland did not meet the spirit of democracy and freedom as guaranteed by the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. The current Polish government is primarily under the control of the Soviet Union. What exactly is the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland? The following is a report from Warsaw by a correspondent for the "London Times Weekly," with extremely keen observations.</p>
<p>At the last United Nations General Assembly meeting, Gromyko proposed to investigate the military presence of various countries overseas. If an investigation is carried out, the number of Soviet Red Army troops in Poland should naturally also be included. Not long after the end of the war, the number of Soviet officers in the Polish army was extremely high, but it has gradually decreased. According to the report of the Polish Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Rola-Żymierski, since June 1945, more than 14,000 Soviet officers in the Polish army have been successively withdrawn and returned to their country, including 40 generals. Currently, there are still quite a few Polish officers receiving training from the Soviet side in Moscow and Warsaw. Soviet officers remaining in the Polish army wear Polish uniforms, and in fact, many of them are of Polish descent.</p>
<p>Seaports and Airports</p>
<p>Although the seaports have nominally been returned to Poland, many important strongholds remain in Soviet hands. As for the airports, most are under Soviet control. Passengers taking civilian airlines can only stay in the waiting room and cannot take a single step beyond it. Polish officials admit that due to a shortage of aircraft and flight personnel, the training of Polish military and civilian aviation personnel must rely entirely on the Soviet Union. The aircraft currently used by Poland are also mostly made in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Poland naturally carries a very strong Soviet influence in both domestic and foreign affairs. In foreign affairs, Poland follows the Soviet Union's lead in all diplomatic gatherings. The main decision-makers of foreign policy in its government, namely Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Modzelewski and State Secretary Berman, are extreme communists, and everything naturally follows Molotov and Vyshinsky.</p>
<p>In domestic affairs, the most significant point is the secret police system. In Poland, we often hear accusations that Soviet officers are manipulating the secret police department, and that the director, Radkiewicz, is fundamentally Russian. These accusations are not very well-founded, because in fact, Soviet officers have nothing to do with the Polish secret police department. However, one thing is very clear: the power of this independent secret police system was copied from the Russians.</p>
<p>In purely domestic affairs, the Soviet Union has not interfered much. For example, Marxism is not promoted in schools, and foreign language electives, both Russian and English, are available at will and not compulsory. Railways, post offices, telecommunications, and other institutions are managed by the Poles themselves, and the Soviets do not participate.</p>
<p>Soviet Activities</p>
<p>Soviet embassy personnel and military representatives in Poland are generally very cautious, stay out of the public eye, and do not have much contact with the outside world, even the Soviet journalists in Poland are like this. On the other hand, cultural activities are very bustling, with Soviet films being shown everywhere and Soviet books being sold everywhere. The Red Army in Poland also publishes its own newspaper called "Free Daily," which is widely distributed in Warsaw, and its main goal is to promote the strength of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The gradual withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland is to avoid stimulating Polish sentiments. The general Polish population does not have a favorable impression of the Soviet Union. Due to centuries of historical relations, the memory of Cossack and Tsarist brutality has not been erased. At the same time, Poles consider themselves to be of the "Western" race and look down upon the "Eastern" Russians to some extent. When Red Army officers go to Polish bars, the waiters' attitude towards them is quite indifferent.</p>
<p>Polish Attitudes</p>
<p>The attitudes of Poles towards the Soviet Union can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is those who are trying their best to be pro-Soviet, which includes government leaders and those sent by the government. They believe that Poland must be closely linked with the Soviet Union, which is beneficial to Poland. The second category is those who recognize the need to unite with the Soviet Union, but do not feel that this is a blessing for Poland. Generally speaking, the middle class, liberal professionals, and upper-class farmers belong to this category. They support Pan-Slavism, but do not agree with the Soviet economic system. The third category is those who are vehemently opposed to the Soviet Union, which includes industrialists, landlords who have been deprived of their land, missionaries, and some armed opponents hiding in the forests. In addition, there is a group of Poles in exile who are also vehemently opposed to the current provisional government.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Soviet Union is seizing this area and refusing to let go, and on the other hand, it is frequently sending out signals of goodwill, using it as a barrier to its west.</p>
<h3>An Eight-Year Account of Airplane Accidents in the United States, With More Than 440 Fatalities</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] From 1939 to 1946, the death rate of passengers on scheduled airlines in the United States was one passenger death per 3,466,755 miles flown, and one crew member death per 13,452,200 miles flown. This is based on mortality statistics from the Bureau of Safety Regulation and the Civil Aeronautics Administration's flight accident records. Although civil aviation in the United States began in 1930, there were no detailed reports. Domestic air transport only fully transitioned to the modern era after the Civil Aeronautics Act was established in 1938, so these statistics begin in 1939. Up to 1946, there were 36 airline plane crashes in eight years, with 355 passenger deaths and 90 crew member deaths. On average, one passenger died for every 52,120,550 "passenger miles" flown. (One aircraft flying one mile is one "aircraft mile," and one passenger traveling one mile is one "passenger mile." For example, if an aircraft carries 44 passengers and flies 100 miles, the record would be 100 "aircraft miles" and 4,400 "passenger miles." The records of passenger miles and aircraft miles from 1930 to 1938 are unknown, but it is known that a total of 205 passengers and 109 crew members were killed.) The changes in the design of commercial airplanes can be seen from the average number of deaths in each accident. From 1930 to 1938, there was an average of 2.75 passenger deaths and 1.45 crew member deaths per plane crash. From 1939 to 1946, due to the increase in the size of aircraft, the average death rate per accident increased to 8.33 for passengers and 2.43 for crew members. The first accident with more than ten passenger deaths occurred last January, when a plane crashed in Curtis, killing 14 passengers and three crew members. Although airlines represent the majority of passenger travel, they only make up a small part of the entire aviation industry, with their aircraft accounting for only one percent of civil aircraft in the United States. Last year, in addition to airline planes, there were 500 fatal accidents and 6,400 non-fatal accidents. Chartered and irregular flights had a total of eight fatal accidents, with 58 passengers and 23 crew members killed. According to reports from scheduled airlines, there were 22 accidents with no deaths last year.</p>

<h3>The Fire Case Opens the Tip Box: The Captain Brings His Wife to Fight the Fire, and a Woman With a Pockmarked Face Takes a Vase - Two Letters Are Prepared for Submission to the Court for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The tip box for the Seymour Road fire case was opened publicly yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. by Ke Kexin, chairman of the five-person investigation committee, and Zhang Nai'er, representative of the Senate. There were only two tip letters in the box, and upon opening and reading them, it was stated that there was a "firefighting wife" on the fire truck, which was truly outrageous. The other letter accused residents of taking advantage of the fire to loot. The investigation committee is prepared to submit them to the court for a thorough investigation. The two letters are listed below:</p>
<p>"When the Yichang Road fire brigade arrived at the scene of the fire, I saw two women in combat fatigues on the fire truck. At the time, I thought they were female firefighters, but later I heard that it was the wife of the fire captain. To this day, the matter is suspicious. I am reporting this matter to ask the authorities to thoroughly investigate what the intention was of the fire brigade bringing a woman. A neighbor surnamed Sun."</p>
<p>"I saw a woman, thirty years old, (living in a wooden house in Lane ____, Wuding Road), with a heavily pockmarked face (from having smallpox). That night, she took a vase and many other things from the fire scene and hurriedly moved east several times. My aunt told me that this woman lived in Qianyi Lane and that they used to run a firewood shop. My aunt often saw her when she went to buy firewood, but it's a pity my aunt can't remember her name, which is a real shame. (Not signed)"</p>
<p>Someone Proves that Two Policemen Helped With the Rescue</p>
<p>[Another report] Regarding the incident of policemen No. 1850 and No. 335 breaking into the fire scene, the investigation committee visited Chen Zhiqing, director of the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau, his section chief Neng Yixichao, and patrol officer Xiao Zosheng yesterday afternoon. According to them, when a fire occurs, the police station, fearing that villains will take the opportunity to loot, sends officers to the scene to assist in maintaining traffic. However, their activities are limited to outside the fire scene and they cannot enter the fire scene without orders or special circumstances. After receiving the report on that day, the Changning Road Sub-Bureau sent six uniformed police officers and two plainclothes police officers to the fire scene to assist in guarding the area. However, policemen No. 1850 and No. 335 were not among them. Police officer No. 1850 was a patrol officer, and police officer No. 335 was a duty officer. If they were at the fire scene, it would be a clear case of abandoning their posts according to police regulations.</p>
<p>Director Chen said that if someone can prove that the two policemen did indeed enter the fire scene without authorization, they must be severely punished. The bureau has not only sent officers to search the homes of the two policemen, but has also escorted them to the Inspectorate of the Headquarters for investigation. However, according to Inspectorate Chief Zhang Da, who spoke to reporters yesterday, Yang Junshan and Yin Bingquan, who live at No. 3, Lane 660, went to the Headquarters to testify for the two policemen, saying that police officers No. 1850 and No. 335 were acting bravely and helping them rescue their property, and were definitely not "taking advantage of the fire to loot." As for the so-called "suspicious pockets," they were filled with towels for thirst relief. They also said that in addition to the two policemen mentioned above, officers No. 792, No. 1834, and No. 1833 also helped with the carrying. Since the police officers entered the fire scene, the police station must conduct a detailed interrogation. In addition to the first two who are being held, the latter three will also be questioned individually.</p>
<h3>A Citizen Even Submits a Letter</h3>
<p>The Senate has also received a letter from a citizen regarding the Wuding Road fire, stating that the police work in this case must have been lacking, because if there were honest and conscientious police officers at the scene, the firefighters would never have been so undisciplined. It also stated that some victims received threatening letters after the incident, which must have been sent by those who participated in looting during the fire, and their handwriting should be compared, etc. Senate representative Zhang Nai'er has now submitted the letter to the investigation committee for investigation and improvement.</p>
<h3>Rumors Abound and Misunderstandings Increase - Firefighters Who Cherish Their Reputation Are All Discouraged - Everyone Is Preparing to Pack Up and Leave</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang said yesterday that since the Seymour Road fire occurred, rumors have been rampant and misunderstandings have increased, causing those who usually cherish their reputation to feel discouraged and their work morale to be extremely low, and most of them are already preparing to "pack up and leave." After being hit by this incident, I have completely lost confidence in my work over the years. After the investigation of this case is over and the truth is revealed, I will resign to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Chen Qian, the district team leader of the Hongkou sub-team, has been involved in firefighting for more than 20 years. The scars on his left cheek are from burns he suffered ten years ago during the fire at the Yangzhou Road Power Company. To this day, his left eyelid is everted and bright red, and his mouth cannot be opened wide, so his voice is low. He was very emotional yesterday and told reporters: "We love this job and enjoy this job, so we have stayed in our posts for decades. However, the accusations from society have made us have to leave our posts." He was filled with emotion. Zhou Zhaoxiang finally stated that in the next session of the Senate, he will urge strict bans on lanes and vendors that do not meet building requirements. He also said that he would welcome local residents to assist in handling firefighting facilities, and he believes that improvements will be faster.</p>
<p>According to Xie Zhiyong, section chief of the Fire Department, the excessively low pay of firefighters is the biggest reason for the low work efficiency. Their current salaries range from 140,000 to 150,000 yuan to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, making it difficult for them to maintain their personal lives, let alone support their families! Therefore, those who are currently working in the Hongkou District Fire Department are either old or young, and the young and strong have long since switched to other jobs. In the Central District Fire Brigade, there is a large turntable ladder truck, whose ladder can be raised to 150 feet high to put out fires in high-rise buildings. It is said that there are only four of these vehicles in the world, and this city owns two of them. The vehicle is heavy and difficult to maneuver, and only experienced people can drive it. It is pitiful that they have mastered such a unique skill, but their families are still in danger of freezing and starving. Chief Zhou showed reporters his tattered clothes covered with patches yesterday, and then said with a wry smile: "How will we spend the days ahead?"</p>
<h3>U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration to Establish an Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration will soon set up a regional office in the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai to handle the maintenance, repair, and communication inspections of American commercial aircraft flying to various parts of the Far East, and will also cooperate with the Chinese transportation authorities on aviation technology.</p>
<h3>Flying Tiger General Flies From Guangzhou to Shanghai - Well-Received During a Week-Long Trip South</h3>
<p>After leaving Shanghai by plane on the 30th of last month for a week-long trip to the south, General Chennault returned to Shanghai by special plane from Guangzhou at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. During the week, he visited Guangzhou twice and inspected Liuzhou and Guilin after the war. The purpose of Chen's trip to the south was to inspect the situation in various areas of South China and the progress of the work of the Air Transport Brigade, and to urge the responsible persons to work actively. When he arrived in Guangzhou and Guilin, he was warmly welcomed by local senior officials and local people. In Guangzhou, Director Zhang [blank], Chairman Luo [blank], Mayor Ouyang [blank], Commander Xiang [blank], and more than 30 people from all walks of life went to the airport to see him off and looked forward to meeting again. The Air Transport Brigade currently has five aircraft, and other aircraft will continue to fly to Shanghai from Manila and [blank] Island. Chen is very concerned about the post-war recovery and relief work in South China and is willing to make the greatest efforts to achieve his goals.

<h3>Work Insults Settled With Apologies</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the Seymour Road and Wuding Road fire, citizens have many complaints about it, and the firefighters feel that there are misunderstandings on all sides. Moreover, they say that the media's accusations have had a great impact on their work. According to Team Leader Chen, at 8:00 a.m. on February 1st, a fire broke out at the Zhongnan Can Factory at No. 241 Xinji Road. When the fire truck heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, the fire had been extinguished, but white smoke was still rising from the roof. At that time, it was determined that the remaining fire was still brewing in the roof mezzanine. Three firefighters and policemen were about to climb onto the roof to try to pry open the tiles and extinguish the fire, but an employee of the factory came out and interfered, preventing the firefighters from climbing onto the roof and using insulting language. Later, the firefighters asked him to go up to the roof with them and pointed out the fire that was still burning. At that time, the firefighters were all enraged. Later, the manager of the factory, Cai, apologized on the spot, and the matter was settled.</p>
<p>Xie Zhiyong, section chief of the Fire Department, also said that a similar incident occurred on Xinzha Road a few days ago. Because the current hoses are mostly old and dilapidated, the hose suddenly burst when the water came out. A young man watching next to it suddenly said: "This way, we can talk about the catty again." The firefighters could not stand the insult, so after the fire was put out, they brought him back to the Fire Department to prepare to send him to the police station for questioning to find out the truth. Later, Fire Chief Zhou Feixiang stopped them. Chief Zhou instructed his subordinates: "The facts are the best proof. There is no need to make a fuss." A storm was finally settled.</p>

<h3>The Rickshaw Puller Stabbing Case - Cheng Rongfang Withdraws the Lawsuit, But His Brother Suddenly Expresses Dissent - Whether or Not the Withdrawal Can Be Allowed Depends on Investigating the Injuries</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the case of the American sailor stabbing the rickshaw puller, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for causing serious injury. The District Court had held a hearing, and the defendant, Rogers, had confessed to the crime without denying it, but claimed that it was out of self-defense. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, is still being treated in the Public Hospital, but his injuries are gradually improving. The defendant recently entrusted Yao Yongli and other lawyers to go to the hospital to reconcile with Cheng Yongfang. As a result, Cheng signed the withdrawal of the lawsuit. However, yesterday, Cheng Rongfang's elder brother, Cheng Rongquan, and his lawyers, Chen Zhenzhou and Lian Ze, filed a petition with the court, claiming that the previous withdrawal of the lawsuit was invalid, saying that Cheng Rongfang's signature was caused by coercion and fraud.</p>
<p>According to sources from the District Court, Cheng Rongquan's request to confirm the invalidity of the withdrawal of the lawsuit was delivered to the court at 10:00 a.m. Whether or not the request can be granted depends on whether Cheng Rongfang's signature was obtained through coercion and fraud. At the same time, the withdrawal of the lawsuit also needs to be investigated, and it will only take effect if the victim's injuries have indeed fully recovered. Otherwise, even if the victim himself agrees to a reconciliation, the defendant should still be held criminally responsible.</p>
<p>According to the prosecutor in charge of the case, the victim suffered serious injuries during the investigation of the case, so the prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, which is a non-private offense that cannot be withdrawn. If the victim's injuries improve and he is indeed able to fully recover, the Criminal Court can change the article of prosecution. If it is confirmed to be an ordinary injury case, then it is a private offense, and the victim can withdraw the lawsuit.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Club Finds New Location and Moves In</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The former Japanese Mutual Aid Association on Penglai Road in this city is currently leased by the U.S. Navy Club. The U.S. military authorities said that the lease of the club's address will expire on the 14th of this month. The Central Trust Bureau will allocate it to the Municipal Senate for use, and they have found a new address, the U.S. military club at the Racecourse on Mahou Road, and will gradually move in from today. However, the U.S. Navy Club said that there are many furniture and equipment to be selected, so they sent a letter to the Central Trust Bureau requesting that it forward to the Municipal Senate a request to extend the lease for one week or ten days after the expiration date so that they can completely clear out the address. However, according to the Municipal Senate authorities, the second general meeting of the association is about to be held, and the renovation and layout of the new address will also take considerable time, so they are considering whether to grant the request of the U.S. military authorities or shorten the time limit.</p>
<h3>Previously Arrested for Theft at He Yingqin's Residence, Young Thief Reoffends and is Caught Again; Both Thief and Stolen Goods Recovered in Just Twenty-Four Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhu Wenxiong, a native of Jiading, resides at 193 Maoming South Road, in a two-story Western-style house with an exquisitely decorated living room on the lower floor. Between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM on the 5th, almost everything on display in the living room was stolen. This included a green English stone triangular table cover, a pink "Xiangnan" porcelain eagle, a crystal ball with a one-foot-wide red sandalwood base, a brownish-gold Bixi lion statue, ten pairs of ivory chopsticks, a silver fruit platter, two small red sandalwood inlaid ivory screens, four silver flower basket candy dishes, a complete set of scholar's stationery, and three tablecloths. The total value of these items is estimated at seven to eight million yuan.</p>
<p>After discovering the theft around 7:00 AM, a report was filed with the Lujiiawan Police Station at 11:30 AM, requesting an investigation. The Chief of the Zhao Branch immediately ordered Hao Jingyi, the Head of the Criminal Investigation Division, to investigate. He immediately printed missing item notices, and Division members like Dong Yixiang and Police Chief Weng Mingxun were dispatched. They first notified antique dealers, pawnshops, and jewelry stores. Plainclothes officers were stationed in the concentrated antique areas along Tongfu Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Guangdong Road, and Changbang Road. Around 2:00 PM, the branch received a phone call from Ma Afa, who runs an antique stall named after himself at the Guangdong Road Antique Market at number 226. He reported, "Around 10:30 AM today, at the Jincaiji Antique Store owned by my cousin Wang Congyi at number 202 Guangdong Road, I saw two unfamiliar men trying to sell a pink 'Xiangnan' porcelain eagle for three million yuan. After negotiating, I bought it for one and a half million yuan. Seeing that the stolen item notice from your branch listed a similar item, I suspect it might be the stolen one. Please come and identify it." Division member Dong, accompanied by the victim, went to the market and found Ma Afa. After showing the eagle, the victim confirmed that it was indeed the stolen item. Ma Afa was immediately taken to the station for questioning about how he discovered the stolen goods. Ma described the clothing and accents of the two suspects. After discussion, Head Hao and the others believed the thieves likely had other items to sell at the store, so they sent Ma Afa back to the store while officers were stationed there. Around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, two young men arrived – one in Zhongshan suit, the other in Western suit – carrying items to sell. The shop assistant signaled to the officers, who arrested both men and brought them in for questioning. Fingerprint checks revealed both had prior records. One was Zhu Yao, 24 years old, from Shanghai, unemployed, and with no fixed address. The other was Li Jun, 23 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at 32 Meilan Lane, 598 Huangpi South Road, and running the Beiji Fruit Store at the intersection of Fuxing West Road and Ladu Road. Both confessed to stealing Zhu Wenxiong's belongings and revealed the location of the hidden loot. Officers escorted them to the Guangdong Road Antique Society at number 226, where the gold Bixi lion statue was found. At the Boguzhai store at number 53 Jiangxi Road, the crystal ball was recovered. The remaining items were found upstairs at the Beiji Fruit Store. They also confessed to committing a major theft at the residence of former Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin on Linsen West Road on February 20th of the previous year, for which they were apprehended by the police. From the time of the theft to the recovery of all the stolen goods, the case was solved in less than twenty-four hours, a truly remarkable feat. While Li Jun was in custody, a woman named Xie Jia came to visit him. It is said that Xie and Li are cohabitating, and Xie comes from a prominent family.</p>

<h3>Taikoo Wharf Dispute: Mayor Mediates, Decides Old Workers to be Reinstated; Registration and Review to Begin Today; Disruptions Will Be Strictly Punished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mayor Wu met with worker representatives He Changzhi, Zhou Chengxiang, Hou Mengzhi, and worker legal advisor Lawyer Lin Youtong regarding the Taikoo Wharf labor dispute. Mayor Wu first stated that worker Zhou Ruisun's slander and obstruction of official duties have been handed over to the court for swift action and are unrelated to this case. Regarding the handling of this case, he had previously convened all relevant parties for mediation, and it was decided that all old Taikoo Wharf workers who could provide proof would be allowed to join the wharf labor union and work at Taikoo Wharf. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for handling the registration. However, in the past two days, workers have hesitated to register because they did not understand the government's good intentions in arranging for old workers to be reinstated. Now, the registration period has been extended, starting today. Failure to register will be considered as a waiver of rights. Lawyer Lin guaranteed full compliance. The Mayor also stated that if there are any doubts about the qualifications of old workers during registration, they can individually petition the municipal government for review. In any case, the cargo handling of Taikoo Company cannot be stalled indefinitely due to the worker issue. Therefore, starting today (the 7th), Taikoo Company must both begin cargo handling and conduct registration. Any continued obstruction or participation in disturbances by non-wharf workers will be strictly punished for inciting workers to violate government laws.</p>
<p>Old Workers Hope for a Reasonable Solution</p>
<p>Also, yesterday at 12:00 PM, representatives of the old worker leader Zhou Ruisun's side, including Zhou Chengxiang, Hou Mengfang, and Sun Wenfu, along with protecting lawyer Lin Youtong, held a reception for reporters on the ninth floor of the YMCA to report on the facts and the government's handling of the situation. Lawyer Lin also issued a three-point statement on behalf of the old workers: (1) Guarantee that all Zhou's workers will demand to return to work within the bounds of the law. (2) Wharf workers are managed by the government and have no employment relationship with Taikoo Company. (3) If a fair and reasonable resolution to this case cannot be obtained in the shortest possible time, all old workers will petition to the central government in Nanjing for relief. Finally, Lin appealed to the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Council to participate in the mediation work to seek a fair resolution and avoid making things worse.</p>
<h3>British Electric Tram Workers Dispute Over Wage Increases</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The British Electric Tram Company had a labor dispute last March over base salary and year-end wage increases. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, both parties drafted an adjustment form, which was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. Now, a year has passed, and the workers have approached the company, claiming they have not seen a wage increase. The company replied that it was already included in the adjusted salary. The workers argued that it was not included, so they requested an explanation from the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau is currently considering a response.</p>

<h3>Student and Teacher Steal Brother-in-Law's Clothes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Zhongche, a native of Sichuan, resides at 288 Tiantong Road, Hongkou, and serves as the accounting director at the Western Pacific Enterprise Company. His wife, Wu, has a younger brother, Wu Zhongyun, 15 years old, who lives with Zhang and is funded by Zhang for his education. He previously studied at Zhengbeng Elementary and Middle School at 215 Tangshan Road. A teacher at the school, Shi Ruoyang (32 years old, from Jinhua), got along well with Wu and often went out with him during his free time. Later, Shi was dismissed by the school for some reason, and Wu soon dropped out as well. The other day, at dusk, Zhang Zhongche and his wife went to the Grand Theater to watch a movie. Wu Zhongyun said he had already seen it and did not go. He then tricked the maid into getting the key, opened the door with Shi, entered his sister's room, packed all the valuable ornaments into a suitcase, and hired a car to flee. When Zhang and his wife returned after the movie, they discovered that valuable items such as diamond rings, suits, and fur coats, estimated to be worth fifty to sixty million yuan, had been stolen. Zhang reported the theft to the Hongkou Police Station. Division Head Shi and Division Member Jiang Tianfu investigated and apprehended Shi at the Mingda Cotton Cloth Store on Yalu River Road. Shi confessed that Wu planned to escape to Nanjing on the night train. The original investigating officers followed him to the North Station and arrested Wu, recovering all the stolen goods. Both were taken into custody and interrogated. They confessed to conspiring and stealing, and were handed over to the judicial authorities for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Boat Seized, Salt Police Guarding the Boat Strangled to Death; Suspect Transferred to District Attorney's Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yang Guangzhong, a sergeant in the fourth squad of the Shanghai First District Salt Affairs Office, led several salt police officers to Tangwan Lock and Jiangkou to investigate salt smuggling last December. On the first day, they seized 130 dan and 40 jin of smuggled salt. The next morning, they seized another 35 dan and a small wooden boat. Yang hired a large boat to transport the seized salt back to Shanghai. Because there were few boatmen available, Yang rowed the small boat himself. On the way, he met a man who looked like a villager, claiming to be Sun Qiuquan, who volunteered to row the boat for Yang. Yang happily agreed and let Sun into the small boat. Yang returned to the large boat and assigned second-class officer Yao Dunzuo to guard the small boat. Sun Qiuquan rowed the small boat very slowly, seemingly intentionally lagging behind. At the time, the wind and waves were very strong, so Sun claimed that the small boat could not move forward and anchored at the Jiangkou kiln pier for the night, while the large boat continued to sail. After returning to Shanghai, Yang Guangzhong felt that it was inappropriate to leave the small wooden boat anchored in the river overnight, so that night he sent someone to look for it. To his surprise, the small boat was nowhere to be found at the kiln pier. The villagers nearby were discussing it, with some saying that Yao Dunzuo had deserted and others saying that Yao had been murdered. After much investigation, it was learned that Yao Dunzuo had indeed been strangled to death with bare hands by Sun Qiuquan and his friends Pan Agen, Guo Hesheng, Li Shenghong, and others, who threw his body into the river and divided the smuggled salt on the boat before fleeing. Sun Qiuquan was soon arrested by the police, while the other three were on the run. The suspect was handed over to the District Attorney's Office yesterday. District Attorney Ding Tongjun questioned Sun Qiuquan and deemed that the suspicion of premeditated murder was significant, so he ordered him to be taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Military Officer Labors on the Battlefield, Daughter Almost Forced into Prostitution; Serendipitous Street Encounter Results in Joyful Reunion; Untarnished, She Happily Returns Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Junqing, a 38-year-old young military officer from Tianjin, was originally stationed in Wuhu and recently transferred to Jiangsu. While passing through Shanghai, he took a casual stroll yesterday near the Zhucun Village on Liulin Road, Ba Xianqiao. He suddenly noticed a girl standing at the entrance of the alley. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was his daughter, Mao Mao (16 years old). Surprised, he inquired about the reason and the scene of human joy and sorrow unfolded.</p>
<p>Li Jun and his daughter came to Shanghai from the rear in February after the victory two years ago. They were separated in Songjiang. After asking friends to search in all directions, he finally found her in Suzhou. However, because his mission was not yet completed and he feared a repeat occurrence, he entrusted his beloved daughter to the care of his relative Aunt Hong in Tiaodang Lane, Suzhou. Over the year or so, he traveled to various places and was busy with military affairs. He only relied on letters to communicate with his daughter. Due to the continuous rise in prices, Hong's burden became heavier. On the 29th of last month, she entrusted her neighbor Mrs. Ma to bring Mao Mao to Shanghai to find a job for her with relatives and friends in Shanghai to cover daily expenses.</p>
<p>The day after arriving in Shanghai, Mrs. Ma discussed Hong's original intention with her close friend Zhao Zhang, who is the madam of Hanzhuang at number 39, Zhucun Village, Liulin Road in this city. After the introduction, Zhao saw that Mao Mao was intelligent, quick-witted, beautiful and attractive, and immediately took a liking to her, willing to take her in as an adopted daughter and remit all living expenses to Hong on a monthly basis. Although Mao Mao had only been in Shanghai for a short time, after being embellished by Hong, she was transformed into a modern girl. However, Mao Mao knew how to love herself, and fortunately Zhao Zhang had no unscrupulous intentions, so she has remained untarnished. This is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, Mao Mao was wandering around the entrance of the alley when she happened to meet her father, Li Jun. The unexpected encounter in a foreign land filled them with mixed emotions of sadness and joy, and they could not help but burst into tears. The father, unaware of the details, mistakenly believed that she had been abducted by bad guys, so he went to number 39 and dragged Zhao Zhang to the Taishan Police Branch, accusing her of interfering with the family. After an investigation, the whole story was revealed. However, Li Jun still did not believe it and insisted that the police send his daughter to the hospital for examination. The police approved his request and sent personnel to accompany Mao Mao to the Nanyang Hospital, where female doctor Li Zhenyi examined her and confirmed that she was indeed a virgin. Only then was he relieved of his doubts. However, Mao Mao now decided to return home with her father, so Zhao Zhang, although she loved the girl as if she were her own, had no choice but to watch them leave together, talking and laughing.</p>
<h3>Criminal Report on the Great Fire Case Transferred to the Court; Administrative Part Can Also Be Concluded This Week</h3>
<p>After days of public investigation by the Investigation Committee on the Great Fire Case, various tasks have come to an end. The five-member Investigation Committee has collected all the most concerning criminal-related information and prepared a report, which was approved by Mayor Wu and ordered the Police Bureau to transfer it to the court for investigation and trial according to law. The administrative part is still under investigation and is expected to be completed within this week. In order to clarify the truth of the case to the public and the government's measures, the full text of the criminal part of the report is disclosed.</p>
<p>Ge Kexin's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Wuding Road Fire Investigation Committee, the members of the committee have obtained several pieces of physical evidence and more than sixty copies of transcripts and charts after several days of hard work. In addition, five firefighters and police officers have been sent to the court for trial, and two commanders have been suspended for investigation. Everything is open and there is no concealment. The authorities will quietly wait for the court to continue the investigation and handling. The outside world's concerns about "much ado about nothing" will naturally be dispelled. The remaining administrative part is still under investigation. If there are any weaknesses, we will never avoid treatment for fear of illness. It is expected that the municipal government will be able to work with all citizens to seek the improvement of fire control.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Report</p>
<p>The full text of the first report of the Wuding Road Fire Investigation Committee is as follows: It was found that at 9:30 pm on January 22, 1947 (the first day of the Lunar New Year), a coppersmith at No. 425 Wuding Road was careless, and the fire spread to the wooden house built on the east side of No. 29, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road (formerly Seymour Road), adjacent to the west, and the Yongqin Rubber Factory at No. 423 Wuding Road, adjacent to the east. After receiving the alarm, the Fire Department first drove from the Jing'an Temple area to the fire scene on Wuding Road for rescue, around 10 o'clock; subsequently, fire brigades from the Central, Xinzha, Hongkou, Yichang Road, and other districts successively dispatched to rescue. Twenty minutes later, the fire at No. 425 and the wooden house at No. 29, Lane 660, adjacent to the west, and the Yongqin Rubber Factory, adjacent to the east, gradually subsided. Half an hour later, the third floor of No. 29, Lane 660, adjacent to the west, reignited, and the fire became uncontrollable. The fire then spread westward, successively burning down eight Western-style houses at No. 27, 23, 21, 15, 11, 5, and 3, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road. The embers were completely extinguished at 1:00 pm on the 23rd. In total, the fire burned for fifteen hours, causing public uproar and spreading rumors. From January 29 to February 2, 1947, for five days, inquiries were made to the victims, neighboring witnesses, responsible officers of the fire brigade present on the day, and the US military fire brigade. Based on the information obtained, the following facts were determined:</p>
<p>Second Fire Is Highly Suspicious</p>
<p>(1) Outbreak of Fire—It was found that the initial fire started at the coppersmith's shop at No. 452 Wuding Road, and after spreading to the wooden house on the east side of No. 29, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road, it was extinguished. About half an hour later, the third floor of No. 29 reignited. After on-site inspection, it was observed that the wooden house built by No. 29 only reached the second floor. The number of windows where it was connected to the original house of No. 29 only burned to the wooden frame of the window. There were no traces of burning near the inside of the window. The source of the second fire on the third floor of No. 29 seems to be speculation. Further investigation revealed that Huang Afu (also known as Huang Baogui), the driver of the Wang Yunfu family (i.e., No. 29), and what the neighbors saw, along with the traces of the fire scene, showed that the second fire clearly started on the third floor and then spread downward. According to the testimony of Wang Anai, the nanny of the Wang family, the windows and doors were closed at the time (see the transcript). Therefore, the cause of the fire on the third floor, whether it burned in from the outside or started inside, raises doubts.</p>
<p>Extortion of Gold Bars Not Substantiated</p>
<p>(2) Extortion of Gold Bars—(1) Yongqin Rubber Section: It was found that the rumor that the owner of the Yongqin Rubber Factory paid gold bars, so the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire and were spared from being burned, has been investigated. The owners of the factory, the Tong Keqin and Tong Kede brothers, and the workers in the factory all flatly denied it. Although this is one-sided and not credible, the factory is adjacent to No. 425, the fire point, and its location is slightly to the southeast. The wind direction on that day was from northeast to southwest, and the factory was upwind. The factory also had more than a dozen fire extinguishers, and five workers were applying rescue at that time. After the fire, the flat house at No. 425 collapsed instantly, so the fire was not spreading very fast in that area, and it was easy to extinguish, which is reasonable. It is difficult to immediately determine that the factory bribed with gold bars. (2) Wang Yunfu Section: It was found that the rumor that the firefighters extorted gold bars unsuccessfully, resulting in them letting the fire burn, is difficult to judge except for the victim's voluntary identification. After questioning many of the Wang family's masters and servants one by one, they all denied it.</p>
<p>Theft of Property Undeniable</p>
<p>(3) Robbery of Property—(1) No. 29, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road Section: It was found that the Wang Yunfu family lost a large amount of gold and silver, and after questioning Wang Yunfu himself, his daughter-in-law Cheng Suying, and his daughter Wang Chuqin one by one, it can be known that Wang's daughter-in-law's jewelry and other items were indeed burned (see Cheng Suying's transcript). Most of Wang's daughter's jewelry was taken out, but three large gold bars are still missing (see Wang Chuqin's transcript). (However, this point still needs to be determined after excavation at the fire site). Wang Yunfu's silverware has been found, so the above rumors are not entirely credible. However, it was found that the three-door rosewood tree in Wang's wife's room was found to have been split after the incident. Zheng Daijian, a resident of No. 27, saw firefighters carrying two thermos bottles from the back door of No. 29 and going to Gordon Road (see the meeting minutes). Although these clues cannot determine what they robbed, their behavior of stealing property is undeniable. (2) No. 27, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road Section: It was found that in No. 27, in addition to the four firefighters of No. 011, who were identified by Zhou Qihang as opening boxes and robbing towels, handkerchiefs, and other items in No. 27 on the morning of January 23, the firefighters themselves have admitted it and have been detained by the Police Bureau and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action. According to Zhou Qifang's testimony, there were five silver countertops, and two wooden boxes that originally contained the silver countertops and six wooden clothes racks hanging clothes on the second floor were found in the patio the next morning. Therefore, before the fire spread to No. 27 on the evening of the incident, there was indeed theft of property. (3) No. 11 and 15, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road Section: Wang Yingjuan, a maid of Tang Ruichien, a resident of No. 11, once said, "A firefighter came to split the closet when the fire was burning at No. 27, and went upstairs to stop us from going up." There is a need to investigate whether it was necessary to enter between No. 27 and No. 11, which is separated by three Western-style houses. Moreover, he immediately cut down the tree with an axe upon entering the door. At that time, the fire had not yet spread, and there was no danger on the upper floor of the house. His illegal attempt is clearly visible when he hurriedly stopped the family from going upstairs. Song Zhipeng, a military policeman of the Foreign Affairs Group of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, said: "I saw a firefighter inside No. 15 splitting the closet door. Later I asked him what he was doing? He said nothing." Later I saw him take out candies and other items from the closet and share them with other firefighters." It is doubtful whether they opened other closet doors to steal items since the firefighters were not putting out the fire and were actually moving food inside the trees. Yan Zezhi, a resident of the house, said: "I found a set of uniforms in the garden the next day." In light of the aforementioned facts, it is suspicious whether the firefighters who entered No. 15 robbed property.</p>
<p>Why the Brawl Deserves Attention</p>
<p>(4) Fight in Dakang Lane—It was found that around 1:00 am on the evening of the incident, three or four firefighters initially fought on the roof of the carport at No. 31, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road. Later, they continued to fight in Dakang Lane on Wuding Road for a quarter of an hour. This point has been consistently stated by witnesses Xue Jinan, Yue Guisen, Sun Chaoqun, Yang Bida, etc., so it is not a fabrication. At this time, they should have been working together to put out the fire, but instead, they were fighting each other. If there was no conflict of interest, it would not have happened, which deserves attention.</p>
<p>Unanimous Criticism of Ineffective Firefighting</p>
<p>(5) Ineffective Firefighting—It was found that the fire on Wuding Road lasted for fifteen hours and destroyed as many as eight Western-style houses. Regardless of the crude equipment and the immature fire-fighting technical training, it is an undeniable fact that the firefighters and officers of all levels on the scene failed to make efforts to put out the fire. The testimony of Wang Yunfu said, "They were not saving the fire but watching the fire," and the statements of other victims and witnesses were almost unanimous in their criticism. In particular, the US military said, "I saw at least twelve people standing by and watching," and the fact that the firefighters were drinking in the Juxing Garden at No. 446 Wuding Road (with wine bottles as evidence) and harassing the nanny at No. 11 (Wang Yingjuan's transcript) were more concrete.</p>
<p>Separate Opinions Formulated</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, in addition to the shortcomings in fire administration and technology and the points that should be improved, which will be reported in a separate document, the above facts all involve criminal and administrative punishments. The following opinions are hereby formulated separately: (1) Outbreak of Fire Section—It is proposed to transfer this information to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office of the People's Court for reference and special investigation. (2) Gold Bar Case Section—It is proposed to only use it as a type of report material for reference. (3) Robbery of Property Section—In addition to the four firefighters of No. 011, who have been detained and should be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action, the firefighters of No. 245, 76, 90, 360, 278, 348, 550, 586, 400, 184, 925, 102, and 12 who entered No. 29 on the evening of the incident, the squad leaders Zhu Qinglan and Zhou Yuehuan, the firefighters of No. 70, 164, and 2 who entered No. 27, the squad leader Huang Zhongxi, and three others, a total of seventeen people, are proposed to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation first. It is said that Xu Liren, the Central Squad Leader, has supplied Lian Zeng with access, and had met with Team Leaders Zhou Yue and Li, and also the Section Chief (see the transcript). In addition, the firefighters and their numbers who entered the two houses have not been reported. It is proposed to order the Fire Department to investigate and clarify them before sending them to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. (4) Fight in Dakang Lane Section—It is heard from Director Zhou of the Fire Department that the people who fought in Dakang Lane have been found. It is proposed to order them to issue a list of names and transfer them to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. (5) Ineffective Firefighting Section—It is proposed to hand this point over to the Police Bureau for a thorough and detailed investigation of the ineffective officers and police officers and give them the most severe administrative punishment. As for who did not make an effort? The US military said: The police officer at No. 101, Old Yichang Road, can be asked. Who are these twelve people? Who are the people who drank alcohol? In addition, the palace chiefs on the scene are also difficult to escape their responsibility. The above proposals, whether appropriate or not, should be transcribed into an investigation report together with the dossier and submitted for review. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu. Chairman of the Wuding Road Fire Investigation Committee Ge Kexin, members Zhang Da, Hou Junren, Zhang Shizuo, Pan Wenzhen.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Plans to Solve the Housing Shortage; Continues to Build Public Housing; Renews the Previous Proposal to Borrow 100 Billion Yuan from the Central Trust Bureau; Special Letter to the Municipal Council Requesting a Prior Decision on Repayment Method</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Works Bureau stated that the resolution of the Municipal Council's first general meeting on "Building Public Housing in various districts to provide housing for the people" has been studied, but it is difficult to implement due to lack of funds. A reply to the council briefly stated: "There are currently an estimated 60,000 squatter households in this city. To solve their housing problem, assuming that simple public housing is built in phases, the first phase of 10,000 buildings would require 20 billion yuan if each building costs 2 million yuan. Such a large amount of funding is definitely beyond the capacity of the municipal government. In desperation, we consulted with the Central Trust Bureau to allocate half or part of the 40 billion yuan for public school staff housing to build public housing, but the bureau stated that the public school staff housing plan handed over by the Four Allied Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not been decided, so it cannot give a definite answer. It has recently been learned that the bureau's plan has been finalized, and the cheapest type of housing is 10 million yuan. Therefore, the bureau's investment that our bureau hoped for has been disappointed." It also stated: "Our bureau is still planning to build this public housing. There are currently two ways to adopt: (1) Renew the previous proposal to the Central Trust Bureau to borrow 10 billion yuan in the form of acceptance to carry out the second phase of public housing construction. (2) Request the municipal government to establish a citizens' village management committee in advance to actively solicit construction funds and hand them over to the Public Works Bureau to build the third or fourth phase of public housing. As for whether the first loan is to be repaid in installments by the municipal government or by the citizens' village management committee, and whether it is to be built as relief, or still sold by building after completion, the council should decide in advance so that there is a basis for adopting the housing style."</p>

(2) Send telegrams to the councils of various provinces and cities to unanimously respond to the advocacy.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Niu Jingting, a former National Assembly representative from Henan Province, was accused of coming to Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War to operate a tobacco business and having commercial dealings with the North China Tobacco Company of the enemy, with Niu Jingting supplying raw materials.

He argued against the indictment that there was no evidence for the allegation of broadcasting in Shanghai and dealing with the North China Tobacco Company, and the charges could not be established. The charges published in the Henan and Shanghai newspapers were also vague and did not present specific facts, so they should not be believed based on one-sided statements. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer Cao Moulin defended him. The court ordered the trial of the case to be concluded and scheduled the verdict for the morning of the 13th.</p>

<h3>A Police Officer Encounters an Enemy: False Tax Collector Accused and Brought for Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lin Yizhi from Hangzhou, formerly known as Wang Zhilin, twenty-six years old, during the fall of Hangzhou in the thirty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], served as a tax collector at the Qianjiang Bridge Tax Bureau branch, and also worked under Jin Dechun, the secret service chief under the enemy's military police. Zhang Minghui, a merchant from Shaoxing, passed through Lin's location and was accused of being a guerrilla, arrested, hung up and beaten, and extorted 100,000 pseudo-currency before being released. After the victory, Zhang served as a plainclothes police officer in the Shanghai Police Department. One day, the enemies met on a narrow road. Zhang grabbed Lin Yizhi and legally transferred him to the High Court. During the trial yesterday morning, Lin claimed that he did not know Zhang and did not know why he was arrested. Zhang immediately testified that Lin's former name was Wang Zhilin, nicknamed "Rubber Ball." When he was arrested on the other side of the Qianjiang River, he clearly recognized the face of the accused and confirmed that it was him. After the court hearing, it was decided to postpone the trial, and the accused was remanded in custody.</p>

He was said to have been taken to the North Sichuan Road pseudo-police station, where he was force-fed water and beaten, resulting in a fatal stroke. During the trial in the High Court yesterday morning, the accused firmly denied the beating and waterboarding, claiming that Huan Buying died of illness in the police hospital, and requested that Tang Zihong, the former detective of the North Sichuan Road pseudo-police station, be summoned as a witness. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further investigation, and the accused was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Another Thirty-Four Detainees Released</h3>

Then, the steamship driver Shen Guan was called as a witness, and his testimony was consistent with what the accused stated. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Stall Issues: Vendors from the Eleventh District Market Submit Opinions to the Council</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ju Zuyin and Weng Yongqing, representatives of the mutual aid association of stall vendors from the eleventh district market in this city, have submitted a letter to Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, requesting that the authorities regulate the types of street vendors around the formal markets. Vegetable vendors should be a certain distance away from the market to avoid hindering the market's business. Their reasons are as follows: Open-air vegetable vendors are everywhere around the municipal Shanhai Pass Road market, which not only hinders the business of the formal market but also affects the appearance of the city and traffic. A request for prohibition was previously submitted, and a temporary solution was followed on January 8 of this year, in accordance with the mediation of Municipal Councilors Tang Shichang and Yan Sheng. The authorities have re-regulated the permitted stall areas for street vendors this year. If stalls are also allowed on nearby roads, the business within the market will inevitably be affected. Therefore, a special distinction is requested, such as allowing food stalls and department store stalls that do not interfere with the market's business. In this way, a fundamental solution can be achieved, and everyone can work in peace without disputes.</p>

<h3>Letter of Correction</h3>
<p>To the editor, I read with great shock the news in your newspaper of February 4 this year that more than a hundred bandits were found in Xinzhuang Town, a suburb of Songjiang, and the Self-Defense Corps was surrounded and disarmed. Xinzhuang Town in our county is an important station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and the local government has long paid close attention to security. The so-called stray bandits are absolutely nonexistent. Fearing that the rumors are untrue, I hereby solemnly declare and request immediate correction. - Songjiang County Government</p>
<h3>Council and Others Support the Constitution: Speaker Responds with Commendation by Telegram</h3>

<h3>Two Section Staff Members of the Municipal Government Suspected of Being Traitors: Rewarded for Informing the Enemy; Claimed to Be Poor and Fooled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court heard the Han traitor suspect case involving Sha Jingchuan and Yu Ruzhong yesterday. Sha and Yu both worked in the accounting section of the Municipal Government before the war. In the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], Sha served as a clerk at the Hong Kong Purchasing Office of the Resources Commission. In May of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], Sha returned to Shanghai. In August of the same year, both defendants joined the puppet organization and served as section staff members of the puppet Public Works Bureau. Sha then secretly reported to the enemy that the Resources Commission had secretly established a purchasing agency in Shanghai (i.e., Hengli Company at 515 Cishu Building), and Yu reported the file materials retained by the former Public Works Bureau in Shanghai to the enemy. This led to the seizure of all equipment and funds at the agency. Jiang Zhihua and others, the custodians of public property of the former Public Works Bureau, were also pointed out by Sha Jingchuan, and all forty-two boxes of public property secretly stored in the No. 1 Warehouse of the Shanghai Bank on Suzhou Road were seized by the puppet Public Works Bureau. Sha Jingchuan received a reward of 3,000 yuan in puppet currency, and Yu Ruzhong received a reward of 1,000 yuan in puppet currency. Sha had changed his name to Sha Keliang and was still retained as a section staff member in the Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government after the victory. Yu Ruzhong was still a section staff member in the Municipal Government. They were reported and sent to the High Court for legal action. Both defendants argued that they joined the puppet organization because they were under pressure from life and secretly reported central archives and materials because they were fooled by others. The court adjourned the hearing pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Only One in China: Small Pocket Airplane; Can Take Off and Land Safely with Just Over 300 Feet of Open Space</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Science is becoming increasingly developed, and human transportation is gradually trending toward air development. We can make a firm prediction: There will be a day when all kinds of airplanes shuttle back and forth in the air, just like cars and trains on the ground now. At that time, everyone can have the opportunity to own a plane and soar freely, shortening the concept of distance to the extreme. This non-fantastic vision has already begun to appear in aviation advanced countries. In China, it seems still a pipe dream, but at least we can already smell a bit of breath. Why?</p>
<p>Readers should still remember that a few days ago, China Airlines Flight 145 crashed in western Hubei. The only surviving foreign infant, Paul Vick, was transported from the countryside of western Hubei to Shanghai by a small plane sent by the company. What kind of plane is this small plane that doesn't necessarily need an airport and can land as long as there is a slightly larger open space?</p>
<p>Its name is Piper Cub. It is said that there is only one in China, brought by L.K. Taylor, the representative of Piper Company in China, as a sample. This is a single-engine plane with the wings on the upper part of the fuselage, and the rest of the shape is the same as ordinary planes. Its length, width, height and performance are as follows:</p>
<p>Length 22 feet 6 inches</p>
<p>Height 6 feet 10 inches</p>
<p>Wingspan 35 feet 5.5 inches</p>
<p>Net weight 1,000 pounds</p>
<p>Load 750 pounds</p>
<p>Oil storage 38 gallons</p>
<p>Fuel consumption (normal speed) 6.5 gallons per hour</p>
<p>Normal speed 103 kilometers per hour</p>
<p>Maximum speed 115 kilometers per hour</p>
<p>Take-off distance 480 feet</p>
<p>Landing distance 360 feet</p>
<p>The interior of the fuselage can seat two people besides the driver. The machinery in the cockpit is not as complicated as that of a large airplane. The various meters are slightly more than those in a car, and can be seen at a glance, but they are all-inclusive, with radio and blind flying equipment. It is said that this kind of plane is widely used by civilians in the United States, because it only needs an open space about 300 meters long to take off and land, and it is very easy to drive. Taylor said that anyone can fly after two weeks of training. During the war, the US government also used this small plane as a tool for training pilots.</p>
<p>Taylor is an aviation expert who has been in China for half a year, but his negotiations with the Chinese government to promote Piper Cub have not yet yielded results. He frankly admits that selling this plane is a business task, but he sincerely expresses that he really hopes to help the development of China's civil aviation industry. He said that although news of airplane accidents around the world has been frequently reported recently, aviation safety is generally improving. Currently, on average, there is only one accident for every 8 million kilometers flown by each passenger. Aviation in various countries around the world is advancing rapidly. If China does not catch up quickly, it will inevitably lead to its demise. Compared with the current figures, there are 250,000 pilots in the United States, and less than 500 in China. The United States has nearly 10,000 airports, while China currently has only dozens that can be used. Taylor believes that after Piper Cub is introduced to China, it can not only develop civil aviation, but also be very useful for training pilots in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Piper Cub currently costs only $3,500 US dollars per plane, which is cheaper than a car. It is expected that once the government allows imports, small planes like this will be seen everywhere in the skies above China's fields and cities.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The 23rd regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held at 5:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Chairman Wu, Deputy Chairman Li, Committee members Wang Yangxian, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Rong Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the committee's business department, were present. Liu Jingji and Tong Runfu were also present. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting resolved four major issues: (1) The approval of southern transport permits for yarn and cloth in February will continue as before. According to statistics, the cotton yarn balance from January is 2,579 bales, plus the February quota of 2,967 bales, resulting in a February cotton yarn southern transport quota of 5,546 bales. The cloth balance from January is 57,652 bolts, plus the February quota of 75,647 bolts, resulting in a February cloth southern transport quota of 133,299 bolts. In addition, the southern transport of yarn and cloth handled as special cases includes a cotton yarn balance of 400 bales from January, plus the February quota of 2,000 bales, totaling 2,400 bales. The cloth balance from January is 24,679 bolts, plus the February quota of 35,000 bolts, totaling 59,679 bolts. (2) The originally set highest price list for the purchase of cotton yarn of various counts was incomplete, so the following additions were made: (Unit: Thousands of yuan) 8-count: 1,184 yuan; 12-count: 1,496 yuan; 14-count: 1,616 yuan; 20-count double-ply: 2,082 yuan; 21.5-count: 2,098 yuan; 22-count: 2,145 yuan; 26-count: 2,462 yuan; 33-count: 3,003 yuan; 30-count triple-ply: 3,048 yuan; 40-count double-ply: 4,018 yuan; 60-count: 5,691 yuan; 80-count: 7,937 yuan; 84-count: 8,334 yuan. The prices of all the above yarn counts are still calculated based on a ratio of 1,975,000 yuan for 20-count yarn. (3) The packaging standard stipulated in the cotton yarn purchase price is limited to machine-packed large bales. However, some factories also use straw bales for packaging. The labor and material cost for machine-packed large bales is 25,840 yuan per bale, while the labor and material cost for straw bales is only 9,310 yuan per bale. Therefore, the purchase price for straw-packed bales should be reduced by the difference of 16,530 yuan per bale. (4) Due to recent price increases and increased production costs, the original purchase prices are no longer sufficient and will be adjusted. The adjustment percentage will be studied by the evaluation committee of the six district cotton textile associations, and the Textile Control Committee will then discuss and decide on the percentage. (Note: The members of the evaluation committee include Wu Weijing, Jiang Dixian, Liu Jingji, Tong Runfu, and Cheng (name missing).)</p>

Soybean oil is scarce and in high demand. Northeast soybeans have not yet thawed, and arrivals are scarce. There have been few arrivals along the Longhai Railway recently. Oil factories, both in the city and in other regions, are still actively purchasing, and the market situation is one of demand exceeding supply, with successive peaks and soaring prices of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean cake prices are also rising due to the continued increase in raw material prices. The demand from Shantou and Xiamen remains strong, with another jump of 1,200 to 1,300 yuan.

<h3>Observations on Import and Export Industries After the Implementation of Export Subsidy Measures</h3>
<p>Significant Results May Be Achieved in the Short Term, but Gradual Price Increases Will Still Be Insufficient</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the announcement of the export subsidy measures, the general public is paying close attention. According to a person in the export industry, the provisions of these measures can be regarded as a great stimulus to China's nearly stagnant export business. The 100% subsidy system may achieve considerable results in the next one or two months. However, the high cost of domestic labor and the rising prices of export goods cannot be ignored. Among China's major export products, such as silk, tea, pig bristles, tung oil, cow and sheep hides, and medicinal materials, the pig bristle industry, due to high labor costs and price cuts by large buyers, had already seen 50% of the industry on the verge of bankruptcy before the export subsidy system was established. After the implementation of the subsidy measures, it is inevitable that workers will take the opportunity to request higher wages. In recent days, pig bristle prices have already risen by about 20%. If this situation cannot be improved, the 100% export subsidy may be gradually offset by the rising prices of export goods. Furthermore, regarding the export of tung oil, previously, due to foreign exchange reasons, transshipment through Hong Kong to foreign countries could yield more than 20% profit. With the current subsidy measures, tung oil seeking a way out through Hong Kong may change course and return to Shanghai. The exports of other silk, tea, and medicinal materials will also flourish. Therefore, the export subsidy measures have both advantages and disadvantages. At present, they are regarded as an emergency measure, and their future effectiveness is unpredictable. According to the Import and Export Association, the provisions of the subsidy measures can currently stimulate China's export business. However, with the unstable domestic situation and gradually rising prices, even if the export subsidy is set at 200%, it may be offset by high prices. Therefore, this measure is only regarded as an emergency measure, and its future cannot be viewed with absolute optimism.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Meeting Decides on Allocation of Rayon, Temporarily Limited to the Silk Weaving and Ribbon Weaving Industries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the government's Materials Committee, convened a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss the allocation of rayon. Wang Zijian and Yang Pansheng from the bureau were present, along with Liu Qingyi and Song Baolin from the silk weaving industry. Mr. Wang Zijian gave a report stating that after the trade with Japan, the Central Trust Bureau successively received three batches of Japanese rayon: the first batch of 4,150 cases, the second batch of 4,850 cases, and the third batch of 6,000 cases, totaling 15,000 cases. The Central Trust Bureau's allocation situation is as follows: 7,064 cases for the silk weaving industry, 384 cases for the ribbon weaving industry, 108 cases for the knitting industry, and 296 cases for the dyeing and weaving industry. In other regions, 500 cases were allocated to Tianjin, 510 cases to Shengze and Suzhou, 1,225 cases to Hangzhou, 9 cases to Wuxi, and 8 cases to Huzhou. A total of 10,104 cases have been allocated to the city and other regions, with 4,896 cases remaining. Subsequently, Mr. Yang Pansheng reported that the amount of Japanese rayon imported into China in the first half of this year through trade with Japan may decrease because the production of one pound of rayon in Japan requires two pounds of salt, and Japan currently lacks salt. Therefore, the rayon production may decrease. However, it is hoped that production can be increased in the second half of the year. The authorities are currently planning to transport more salt to Japan for trade. The fourth phase of rayon for trade is currently under negotiation. The Central Trust Bureau has now decided to allocate the existing stock to meet the needs. Finally, the silk weaving industry expressed the hope that the Central Trust Bureau would continue to allocate rayon. After discussion, it was decided that the rayon needed by the silk weaving and ribbon weaving industries would still be allocated by the Central Trust Bureau as usual, while the knitting and dyeing and weaving industries would be temporarily suspended. Starting next week, the silk weaving industry will be allocated one-fifth of its requested amount first. The ribbon weaving industry is still under review, and the allocation date will be determined later. The allocation price will remain unchanged. It is reported that the silk weaving industry is willing to guarantee that the allocated goods will not flow into the black market in the future. The industry has also notified all members that those who have not previously completed application forms should submit them to the association by noon today so that they can be compiled and sent to the Central Trust Bureau for application.</p>

<p>[Nanjing, Our Newspaper Correspondent, 6th] The Ministry of Education had previously issued an order before the war regarding gender-segregated education in secondary schools, instructing the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to forward the order to all secondary schools for compliance.

<h3>Chen Shengshen Talks About His Feelings About Traveling to India After Returning from the Indian Science Conference, Indian Academic Funding is Sufficient, and Modern Physics Research is Emphasized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Chen Shengshen, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office of the Institute of Mathematics of the Academia Sinica, was sent to represent the academy at the 34th annual meeting of the Indian Science Congress. He departed from Shanghai for India on December 29th of last year and returned to China on January 25th. It is reported that this All-India Science Conference was very large in scale, with more than 3,000 members attending, chaired by Nehru. The entire conference was divided into thirteen groups: Mathematics and Statistics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography and Geology, Botany, Zoology, Anthropology, Medicine, Agriculture, Physiology, Education and Psychology, and Engineering. The conference initially consisted of three types: public lectures, thematic discussions, and presentations of papers. This conference will have significant meaning for the Indian science community, and well-known scientists from various countries participated, including ten from the United Kingdom, five from the United States, four from Canada, one from the Soviet Union, and one from France. After the conference, Mr. Chen went to Mumbai to give a week of academic lectures. After returning to China, Mr. Chen said that his biggest impression of India was that the country's academic research funding was sufficient. India has already completed one cyclotron (also known as an atom smasher), and five high-speed electron instruments are planned, which shows that India attaches great importance to atomic energy and modern physics research.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shihuang Engages in Swindling, the Ministry of Education Orders a Crackdown</h3>
<p>Zhang Shihuang, the "Director of the Chongqing Orphanage," came to Shanghai from Chongqing last autumn under the names of "Thousand Buddha University" and "Chinese Orphanage" to raise funds from all walks of life. He successively made absurd remarks. Later, due to a dispute with his female teacher accomplice, Cui Zhenfang, the police station investigated, and the matter has been reported in various newspapers. According to news from the Ministry of Education, Zhang Shihuang had previously requested the Ministry of Education to allow him to travel across the country to promote and raise funds for the establishment of "Thousand Buddha University." The Ministry of Education recently stated that the various claims made by Zhang Shihuang are absurd and border on swindling. It has ordered the local Education Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and crackdown.</p>
<h3>Principal Uses Fire as an Excuse, Lies That Tuition Fees Were Burned</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau is Conducting a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shaanxi North Road National School in this city suffered a fire on the first day of the Lunar New Year, with considerable losses, as reported in previous newspapers. It has now been learned that Chen Suyun, a teacher at the school, revealed the news in the Wenhui and Dagong newspapers the night before, accusing the school principal, Pan Wenzhen, of not making financial matters public on a regular basis. She also accused Pan of reporting falsely about the extent of the disaster in the fire, claiming that the fees collected in advance from students had been burned. She also accused Pan of gathering people to beat her. The reporter visited Director Zhu of the National Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday to inquire about the details. According to him, Principal Pan Wenzhen has not yet formally reported the detailed figures of the school's losses. If there is any false reporting, it will be thoroughly investigated. Pan and Chen have a teacher-student relationship, and according to the investigation by the district supervisor, the matter may have originated from poor personal relations between the two. Moreover, Chen is not a formal teacher, but only a substitute teacher. The Municipal Education Bureau has scheduled to call Pan and Chen to the bureau today to talk to them and inquire about the truth of the matter.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Re-Specifies the Measures for Free Admission of Children of Public and Education Personnel and Orders All Schools to Comply</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has recently specified the measures for the free admission of children of public and education personnel. A notice to all public and private schools has been issued ordering compliance. The original text is as follows: "It has been determined by the 44th Municipal Government Municipal Conference that the measures for the free admission of children of public and education personnel in this city are as follows: Municipal schools should give priority to admitting the children of employees of the Municipal Government. Private schools should give priority to civil servants' children for the 25% of free places. This has been ordered for compliance in the Municipal Education Personnel (35) No. 07488. However, the original plan did not specify the free items, and it is also time-consuming for employees of various agencies to apply for registration with the bureau. Therefore, the following re-specifications are made: (1) Free Items: Municipal vocational schools and middle schools should waive tuition fees and supplementary maintenance fees. Primary schools should waive supplementary maintenance fees. Private primary and middle schools should waive tuition fees. (2) Application Procedures: Starting this semester, those applying for free admission must obtain a certificate from their respective agencies and contact the schools directly."</p>

<h3>Random Jottings on the Sidelines of Basketball</h3>
<p>Chun Mao fought the Giants, emboldened by victory and with remaining courage, creating a leading situation all the way. In the second half, they still took the lead by three points with 14 to 11, but the victory ultimately turned into defeat. A pity!</p>
<p>Chun Mao's center Liu Yu-fu was a great hero of yesterday's game. One person was used as two, attacking and defending, never leaving the bottom line. The balls under Chun Mao's basket were not taken away by the "Giants." This was the reason Chun Mao was in the lead in the first half.</p>
<p>Zheng Jia-biao was the culprit for Chun Mao. He repeatedly missed free throws, otherwise Chun Mao would have taken the lead by at least six points, and their morale would have been boosted, leading to a different situation.</p>
<p>I ran into Mr. He Jin-gui before the game. According to him, he had just recovered from a serious illness and still needed to rest. He hopes to be able to play in a month or two. Mr. He lost two pounds of weight during this illness, which is quite a loss.</p>
<p>The Giants have skilled ball-handling and are tall and strong, truly a major concern for our Chinese team. (Changnian)</p>
<h3>Basketball League: Initially Strong But Waning Later Due to Lack of Endurance, Chun Mao Defeated by the Giants; Women's Team Snow White Crushes Women's Youth Purple</h3>

Snow White came from behind, leading 20 to 16 in the first half. Changing sides and fighting again, Women's Youth Purple's Jian Zhi-guang scored continuously with free throws. Seeing the momentum was fierce, Snow White quickly rose to meet the challenge. Zhang Xiu-li scored with throws and free throws, and Wang Hui-lin added the finishing touch, making it 25 to 18.

<p>The Game is Tense, Chun Mao Takes the Lead</p>

Later, the Giants adopted central breakthroughs and mid-range long shots, which inflicted fatal damage on Chun Mao. After the start, both sides' defenses were extremely tight. Five minutes later, the foreign player Funk leaped up and made the first goal. Chun Mao's Liu Fu-shan returned the courtesy.

<h3>Aerial Relief to Western Hebei</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper’s Tianjin Reporter Li Shaolin</p>
<p>Tianjin, January 30th (Air Mail)</p>
<p>Due to various difficulties and transportation inconveniences under the Communist army's blockade, the post-war relief work in Western Hebei has not been able to begin. Not only has the continuous war on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway cut off the route for transporting supplies, but also the Communist Party's prejudice against the Executive Relief Administration (行總) is a major reason why relief work cannot be promoted. With the arrival of the cold winter, the need for relief in Western Hebei has become even more urgent. Poverty, which was not created in a day, means that in the desolate and barren Western Hebei, almost every household is struggling without food or clothing. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Executive Relief Administration deeply recognize the necessity of relief work in this area. After many days of effort, they finally obtained the understanding of the Communist side and were able to launch relief work in Western Hebei. Regarding the transportation of relief supplies, the Executive Relief Administration signed a contract with the U.S. military to use U.S. aircraft to assist in transportation by aerial dropping. This matter was successfully supported enthusiastically by Commander Howard and U.S. Air Force Commander Sanderson, and was announced on January 28th.</p>
<p>Dropping Supplies</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of relief work, UNRRA sent five American staff members in advance, namely Dr. Osbeck, Mr. Corbic, Mr. Xie Ling, Ms. Doyle, and Ms. Candell, to Western Hebei to make arrangements in advance. The relief area and the dropping target were selected as Fuping County in the Taihang Mountains, and then transferred to other areas from there. The departure point will be loaded from Beiping after the Tianjin side has completed the transportation of supplies. The U.S. military has allocated three C-46 transport aircraft to assist in completing this task. According to the person in charge of the UNRRA Tianjin office, the relief supplies to be airlifted to Western Hebei this time from Tianjin include 1,800 packages of winter clothing, 1,700 blankets, 700 packages of clothing, 1,781 packages of Chinese-style cotton-padded clothes. From Beiping, there are 828 packages of winter clothing, 1,206 small packages of old winter clothing, 768 original packages of winter clothing, 97 packages of blankets and bedding, 1,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes, and 16 boxes of medicines. Starting from the 28th, three aircraft will be dispatched twice a day, morning and afternoon, and are scheduled to complete the transportation in two weeks. The aircraft transportation fee is 65 U.S. dollars per hour.</p>
<p>First Dispatch</p>
<p>The 28th was the first day of aerial delivery. After one dispatch in the morning, the dropping went very smoothly. For the second flight in the afternoon, Tianjin reporters obtained permission from the U.S. military to accompany the flight and observe from the air. Reporters from various newspapers gathered at the Zhangguizhuang Airport in Tianjin. First, they were led by the Executive Relief Administration staff to visit the temporary warehouse inside the airport. All the supplies to be transported had been concentrated here through the day and night care of the organizers. After the visit, the first transport aircraft dispatched returned successively at around 12:00 noon. They arrived safely over Fuping at 10:20 AM, identified the target and dropped the first batch at 10:45 AM, and completed the dropping at 11:07 AM. When the first dispatch was made, Gu Deming, Deputy Director of the Executive Relief Administration's Pingjin Branch, Yang Jin-kui, person in charge of the UNRRA's Pingjin Office, and General Howard, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, were all present to take care of it. This dropping was obviously taken seriously by all parties.</p>
<p>Second Dispatch</p>
<p>The second dispatch was at 2:00 PM. After the reporters filled out their names, reported their weight, and signed a waiver, they boarded the plane one after another. The plane then took off and soared westward. The bustling streets of Tianjin disappeared from sight, followed by the picture of the great plains of Hebei unfolding. Looking down, the earth was crisscrossed by fields, and melted snow turned into ice. The dry tree branches stood stiffly on the ground, making it even more calm and lonely. At 2:30 PM, the three aircraft successively flew over the Taihang Mountains. The snow on the shady side of the mountains had not melted, and the peaks were clustered together. Sparse villages were scattered in the valleys, which made people imagine its barrenness and hardship. After arriving at Fuping, the driver quickly discovered the dropping mark indicated by the white flag in the mountains. Then the plane dived down and descended to a low altitude of 250 meters. At this time, the U.S. military personnel on the plane had fastened their bodies with ropes and pushed the packages out of the cabin door. After circling four times, all the items carried were dropped. At that time, from the plane, it could be clearly seen that those packages were falling straight to the ground. There were more than a hundred people dressed as farmers standing there, with more than a dozen mule carts beside them, presumably waiting to collect these relief supplies.</p>
<p>Returning from Western Hebei</p>
<p>At 4:10 PM, everyone flew back to Zhangguizhuang Airport in Tianjin safely, and all breathed a sigh of relief, but could not help but miss the barren Western Hebei. The people of Western Hebei are poor. Judging from the relief work in other Communist-controlled areas, the Communist Party often fails to distribute relief supplies in the manner prescribed by UNRRA and the Executive Relief Administration. Whether these relief supplies, which cost a lot of manpower and material resources from China and abroad, can be reasonably distributed to every person who really needs relief cannot but make people worry.</p>
<h3>Carrying New Hope in the Flames of War, Haimen is Advancing</h3>
<p>— Ding Yi</p>
<p>Haimen, Northern Jiangsu, 20th</p>
<p>The victorious and eventful thirty-fifth year has slipped away in the flames of war. Just as the thirty-sixth year is approaching, everyone will have new hopes. Haimen, Northern Jiangsu, located in the Yangtze River Delta and separated from Southern Jiangsu by only a river, has very convenient land and water transportation, and its culture is also considered developed. Although it cannot compare to the wealthy counties in Southern Jiangsu, its population of over 600,000 can generally be self-sufficient with its local products. Apart from a few foods that need to be imported from other ports, an average of 10,000 to 20,000 piculs of miscellaneous grains can be exported each year to supply other counties. Originally, this winter season should have been a long period of rest for them to recover their tired bodies and minds. However, due to years of misfortune, this comfortable paradise has become full of sores and is waiting to be rebuilt. The common people are also gasping for breath. After the victory, everyone eagerly hoped that the government would restore order as soon as possible, so that they could live and work in peace. However, in the past year, due to the rebellion of treacherous bandits, raging flames of war have been ignited in various parts of Northern Jiangsu. Various inhumane struggles, killings, and frame-ups have been launched. Rotten corpses and the pungent smell of blood are everywhere. Haimen has also suffered an unprecedented catastrophe due to the chaos caused by the bandit army. The common people are disappointed, especially those trapped in the bandit areas. Under the intensified oppression of the treacherous bandits' "land redistribution," "rent reversal," "emancipation," "liquidation," and other atrocities, it is truly a dark and hopeless situation. Millions of compatriots are forced to flee to foreign lands, eating wind and dew, crying from hunger and cold, looking at their hometowns from afar, and shedding tears in the wind.</p>
<p>Relieving the People from Suffering, Recovering the Outskirts of the County Seat</p>
<p>The surrounding bandit army still threatens Haimen, keeping Haimen in a state of tension and anxiety. Especially two months ago, when Magistrate Liu was about to be transferred, the bandit army around Haimen became even more restless, seizing territory, destroying property, and constantly threatening. They even gathered thousands of troops on a large scale and captured the outer strongholds of Tianbu and Batou towns, which were only a dozen miles away from the county seat of Haimen, in one fell swoop. Dahong Town also fell one after another. On the one hand, the treacherous bandits plundered the people's blood and sweat, loading them onto large and small boats and carrying them away. At the same time, they forcibly pulled away young and strong men, some of whom were slaughtered, others were used to replenish their ranks, and young women were also abducted to serve as the bandits' "comfort women." At that time, Haimen was already in imminent danger, and the people were in a state of extreme panic. This was the most tense period in Haimen's situation. At this time, the newly appointed Magistrate Xie Tingsheng arrived amidst a warm welcome from all walks of life. As soon as Magistrate Xie took office, he first recovered all the outer towns of Tianbu and Batou on the outskirts of the county seat. The restless hearts of the people of Haimen gradually calmed down. He further strengthened the public security of the county seat of Haimen and gradually restored the turbulent social order of Haimen.</p>
<p>Five Hundred Remnant Bandits Launch an Attack Without Success</p>
<p>On the sixteenth of last month, on a rainy morning, the remnant bandits became restless again, regrouping and launching a large-scale, crazy attack with more than 500 troops on Batou Town, ten miles north of the county seat. The security team and militia stationed there were completely surrounded and were about to break into the stronghold. The situation was extremely critical. When Magistrate Xie received the report, he immediately dispatched the National Army, security teams, and home-returning teams to provide reinforcements. In order to encourage morale and ensure the safety of the people, he personally went to the front line to command, accompanied by Ning Jiayu, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Independent First Regiment of the National Army, and Staff Zhang of the Pacification Command. Under his heroic supervision, after a day of fierce fighting, the invading bandit army was completely defeated. The people rejoiced and celebrated when they heard the news.</p>
<p>The National Army Launches a Surprise Attack, Adding a Barrier to the Eastern Border</p>
<p>The Independent First Regiment of the National Army here has been stationed in Haimen for more than half a year since it entered in mid-May last year. The regiment has a total of three battalions: the first and second battalions were ordered to station in Qidong in November last year, and the first battalion remained to defend Haimen. Battalion Commander Ning Jiayu is a straightforward, brave, and valiant man who is very strict in his instruction and management of his soldiers. Usually, it is almost impossible for us to see their soldiers on the road. Almost some people do not even know that there are National Army troops stationed here. Occasionally, when they see one or two soldiers buying things in the market, they are always kind and friendly to the common people, fully expressing their intimacy. Therefore, none of the people here do not have a special affection for them. However, they are the ones who are active on the front lines during combat. It can be seen that their good military discipline and strong combat power are indeed commendable. Half a month ago, the National Army unit was ordered to cooperate with the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth District Township Self-Defense Forces and the Guerrilla Team of Haimen to station in Haifeng Town. At that time, the treacherous bandits gathered more than 2,000 troops and completely surrounded them at 10:00 PM. The National Army was forced to defend itself and responded calmly. After a whole night of fierce fighting, until dawn the next morning, the National Army finally bravely broke through and launched a surprise attack, and finally defeated the bandit army. In this way, a majestic barrier has been added to the eastern border of Haimen, opening up the difficulties for the restoration of the entire territory.</p>
<p>Launching County Administration, Hope for the Restoration of the Entire Territory</p>
<p>In order to completely eliminate the bandit army within the territory, ensure the outer strongholds, and consolidate local security, the county government, in addition to strengthening the original strongholds in Tianbu, Sanhe, Batou, and other towns, has successively recovered the important stronghold of Dahong Town and established important strongholds in Changle, Changxing, Samsung, and other towns. They have been supervising and urging the security teams to work with the National Army to sweep away the remaining bandits in the territory and launch a cleanup operation.</p>
<p>Recently, the Haimen County Government, in order to cooperate with military progress and promote the restoration of the entire territory, has successively ordered the administrative personnel of each district, township, and town, as well as the self-defense teams and security teams of each district, to cooperate with the National Army to advance within their respective districts. The areas that have now been stationed in can control the entire county's tens of miles of long coastal area to the south, and the area within 40 miles to the northwest bordering Nantong. They have all advanced, and to the east, they have also advanced to the outer lines of Qilin Town, 50 miles away from the county seat, and Sanyang Town, 70 miles away, building strong fortresses on the outer periphery, and gradually repairing the traffic routes within the controlled area. The highways that have now been repaired and opened to traffic include the Tonghai Highway to Nantong, the Maochao Highway to Erjia Town, and the highway to Sijiaba. These highways can all be unobstructed. Under the strengthened protection of the government army, traffic security is quite stable. The Haiqi Highway can now directly reach Qilin Town, and it will soon be fully opened, and telephones have also been installed along each highway. The common people can now freely walk on the wide roads.</p>
<p>At this time of year when the seasons are renewed, it is expected that the restoration of the entire territory can be expected soon.</p>

<h3>Widespread Vaccination: A Pioneer of Medical Science, The First Step in the Fight Against Germs</h3>
<p>— Qian Hui</p>
<p>Reports indicate that since last winter, smallpox has been rampant in Hong Kong, and it has also been seen in Shanghai. Those infected are mostly children, and the number of deaths is in the dozens. The health authorities are planning to compulsorily vaccinate over 3.3 million people within the year. This article will introduce and elaborate on vaccination.</p>
<p>The Origin of Vaccination</p>
<p>Smallpox is one of the most virulent and contagious infectious diseases. It is particularly prevalent in winter when we are more likely to be in close contact with each other. Because there is no prior immunity, both adults and children are highly susceptible, and children are more likely to be infected, leading to a higher mortality rate. This disease has been around for perhaps over two thousand years, with severe outbreaks and high mortality rates both in China and abroad. Experience has shown that if one has had a mild case, one can avoid a severe recurrence. This led to the accidental invention of inoculation methods. According to old Chinese methods, there were water seedlings (smallpox scabies dipped in cotton and inserted into the nose), dry seedlings (scab powder blown into the nose), smallpox clothing (having healthy children wear the inner clothing of children who had smallpox for two or three days), and having a wet nurse who had had smallpox breastfeed another infant. Although mild cases were selected for inoculation, severe transmission and intermediate contact transmission were still unavoidable, and widespread implementation was impossible. Therefore, the disease continued to occur sporadically or remain endemic.</p>
<p>Although we already know that the filtrate of smallpox originates in cows, which suffer from cowpox; and that inoculation of the adapted virus of cowpox into humans prevents smallpox, the relationship between the antibody precursors, serum, and morphology of the two pathogens is still not fully understood. However, the immune relationship between the two was observed as early as 1744. In Gloucestershire, England, milkmaids who came into contact with cows suffering from cowpox developed cowpox on their hands and did not contract smallpox during smallpox outbreaks. From 1768, Dr. Riwaril Jermer in that area made in-depth observations. Finally, in 1796, he inoculated pus from the hand of a milkmaid infected with cowpox into a healthy child. This child developed cowpox, and later, when inoculated with pus from a smallpox patient, did not become ill. This confirmed that cowpox could not only be transmitted from cows to humans and prevent smallpox, but also that pus from someone suffering from cowpox could be inoculated into another person to prevent smallpox. He published his findings in 1798. This discovery was the precursor to modern artificial immunization. Although there were initially skeptics, the facts were quickly accepted by the world. The pustules from cows were called cowpox, and inoculation of humans with cowpox pus was called vaccination. The fact that vaccination could prevent smallpox was universally recognized.</p>
<p>Since then, the method of cowpox vaccination has spread to other countries. It was introduced to China in 1805. All countries should be able to utilize this awareness and implement it effectively. The disease will be nearly eradicated in all areas (for example, in our country, in 1872, there were still 2,585 people who were blinded by it, and in 1904, more than 200 people died. Since 1924, due to free vaccination, there have been no cases). But in our country, because implementation is not effective, the method of scarring with pus has not been eradicated, and the disease is still seen every year. There is no way to count the instances of infection or death, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Implementation by the Health Community</p>
<p>Since the value of vaccination is as described above, the government should implement it widely, and the people should accept it without question. However, how to implement it and what to pay attention to needs to be introduced. The following is a more detailed description:</p>
<p>(1) Age of Vaccination: Because infants are susceptible to infection and based on the recommendations of the military, infants should be vaccinated between four and six months of age. Premature and malnourished infants should be vaccinated later. Before entering school, and again during adolescence, everyone should be vaccinated once. Thereafter, anyone should be re-vaccinated during an epidemic to ensure safety.</p>
<p>(2) Season for Vaccination: Should be determined based on health conditions, climate, and the presence of any systemic infectious diseases or skin diseases. If it is summer and there is excessive sweating, itching, and many skin diseases, or if it is winter and there are many other infectious diseases that affect children's health, which may induce systemic or local complications due to vaccination, then early winter or mid-spring may be more appropriate. Diabetics are prone to skin infections and can also delay vaccination slightly. However, if there is a smallpox epidemic, these small concerns should be abandoned for the sake of overall safety.</p>
<p>(3) Location of Vaccination: Usually, the upper third of the outer side of the upper arm is chosen for boys. For girls, to avoid scarring, the upper third of the outer side of the thigh or the outer side of the middle third of the calf can be chosen. The general principle is to avoid areas that are exposed to sweat or excessive friction.</p>
<p>(4) Vaccination Method: First, use alcohol, ether, or acetone to clean the area to be vaccinated and wait for it to dry. Then, take refrigerated and unexpired vaccine and drip it onto the area. Then, use a sterilized needle to gently scratch one or two lines about one centimeter long, or use a needle to prick the area five or six times vertically, or hold the needle at an angle and scrape it over the area several times. The goal is to get the vaccine into the skin without causing bleeding. Wipe away the excess serum with clean cotton. Do not apply any additional dressings. Do not bathe or wash the area with soap within 24 hours. If pus develops in the area later, cover it with a sterilized dressing and change it daily. Do not remove the dressing after it adheres, and do not bathe until the scab falls off.</p>
<p>(5) Reactions: If the attached vaccine has not expired and the vaccination site has not been washed with strong disinfectants or water, there should be a reaction after vaccination. An early reaction indicates a lack of immunity. Reactions can be of several types: (1) If there is slight redness and itching in the area within one or two days, which soon subsides, it can be considered that there is current immunity. (2) If a red pustule one or two centimeters in size appears in the area within three to five days, with vesicles on top, and there is a fever, it can be considered that there is partial immunity. (3) If a larger area of redness and swelling appears after five days, with vesicles that gradually enlarge and become pustules, and there is fever, pain throughout the body, and swollen local lymph nodes, this is "eruption," which indicates that the person is actually susceptible to smallpox.</p>
<p>After successful vaccination, i.e., after eruption, immunity to smallpox develops within twelve days. Since the incubation period of smallpox is eight to twelve days, if proper vaccination is done immediately after exposure to smallpox and there is a good eruption, there is no risk of developing the disease. Even if vaccination is delayed until a few days before the onset of the disease, it can make the disease milder. If there is no reaction in the area after vaccination, instead of interpreting it as immunity, it should be considered that the vaccine is defective or the vaccination method is flawed, and revaccination should be done every two weeks until there is a reaction, because according to historical records, some people have erupted after being vaccinated thirteen times.</p>
<p>Occasionally, if the area becomes infected and develops an abscess or lymphadenitis after vaccination, it should be treated surgically. Or, if the vaccine is not completely wiped away or the pus from the area contaminates another area, causing self-inoculation, there will be no serious consequences. In very rare cases, serious neurological symptoms may occur due to vaccination, but this is extremely rare, and the risk is insignificant compared to the danger of contracting smallpox without vaccination.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a single vaccination can provide immunity for about five years, and after contracting the disease once, one can have lifelong immunity, but recurrence is still occasionally seen. Therefore, we say that everyone should be vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic.</p>
<h3>One of the Worries of Northern Jiangsu: Kala-Azar</h3>
<p>— Yin Suihe</p>
<p>The name kala-azar is somewhat unfamiliar to people near Shanghai, as it is a regional disease prevalent in northern Jiangsu and northern China. However, with the increasing convenience of transportation in recent years, the number of merchants coming and going from northern Jiangsu is also increasing. Therefore, patients with kala-azar are often seen in Shanghai, and our affiliated hospitals can often find a few. Whether this disease will spread here in the future is uncertain!</p>
<p>The signs of this disease can be partially understood from its name. Because more than half of the people suffering from this disease have slightly black skin, and combined with persistent and recurrent remittent fever, it is named kala-azar. The source of the disease is a type of sandfly that bites people and sucks blood, introducing a protozoan parasite called Leishmania donovani into the human body. After an incubation period of two to four months, it begins to manifest. The fever pattern is similar to typhoid fever. Sometimes there may be alternating chills and fever, similar to malaria. However, it has a characteristic feature, which is that the fever pattern within 24 hours may fluctuate high and low two or three times. After three or four weeks, the body temperature drops to normal. After two or three weeks, this fluctuating fever returns for several weeks. This happens three or four times, lasting for about a year and a half. One month after the onset of the disease, the spleen begins to swell. In six months, it can swell to near the navel. At the same time, the liver also has considerable swelling. The patient becomes increasingly thin and weak, often feeling headaches and dizziness, occasionally experiencing night sweats, and the skin gradually turns black. If left untreated, it will endanger life in two or three years, or as short as one or two years. In the past, before the development of effective treatments, eight or nine out of ten people who contracted this disease died. But now, with scientific advancement, there are effective treatments, and the mortality rate is only one or two out of ten.</p>
<p>In terms of diagnosis, in addition to the above-mentioned signs, there is also blood testing, and puncture examinations of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow can provide positive confirmation. In addition to anemia, a decrease in the total number of white blood cells and a decrease in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are also characteristics of kala-azar. The increase in globulin and euglobulin is also unique to it. Of course, these cannot be considered conclusive evidence. If you can perform puncture examinations of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, you will definitely be able to find those deeply sinful protozoa. These are single-celled, the most basic, lowest-level animals. But it is unknown how many of our fellow citizens in northern Jiangsu they kill each year.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment, in the past, it could be considered that doctors were helpless. Since the invention of drug treatment in 1914 (such as Neostieosan, Neostam-Urea, Stibamine, Solustibosan), eight or nine out of ten patients can be saved. This may be considered the recent good fortune of patients in the last thirty years. However, treatment is not as good as prevention. I hope that the local health administration authorities can pay more attention to prevention to eliminate the root causes. This will greatly benefit our fellow citizens in northern Jiangsu, as well as foreign residents.</p>
<h3>Talking About Measles</h3>
<p>— Peng Da'en</p>
<p>Answering Many Questions About Children's Measles</p>
<p>Recently, measles has been prevalent, and it has not subsided from early winter to the present. Parents who have children who have not had measles must be worried day and night, wondering if their children will contract measles? What are some good ways to prevent it? If measles really breaks out, how should they be treated to recover quickly? This article provides a comprehensive answer to questions of this nature.</p>
<p>(1) Who Gets Measles?</p>
<p>According to statistical results, 95% of humans have had measles at some point in their lives, and 50% are children under the age of five. However, young infants from birth to six months are not easily infected with measles, because most mothers have already had measles, and their blood's immune antibodies against measles can be transferred to the fetus through the placenta. However, this passive immunity does not last long and gradually decreases after birth, disappearing almost completely by five or six months. The period from five or six months to school age is the most susceptible to infection. Understanding this, if there are measles cases in the family, infants under six months do not need to be isolated. The rest who have not had measles are at risk of being infected. Especially in Shanghai, where the population has increased dramatically after the war and housing is extremely crowded, this further promotes the spread of measles, causing it to become an epidemic.</p>
<p>(2) How Should Children Who Have Been in Contact with Measles Patients Be Treated?</p>
<p>Logically speaking, everyone will definitely have measles once in their lifetime, and after that, they can be immune for life, saving future troubles. Therefore, generally healthy children of slightly older age are left to their own devices during an epidemic. However, in certain situations, such as very young age (one or two years old), poor nutrition, and various chronic and acute diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, whooping cough, etc., if measles is contracted in addition to these issues, it will add fuel to the fire. The small and weak body will definitely not be able to withstand it and will die young. Therefore, we should prevent these children from contracting measles. If it cannot be avoided, the symptoms must be alleviated. To achieve the above goals, we must use "passive immunization." Currently, there are several commonly used products available for intramuscular injection (see attached table).</p>
<p>The above-mentioned products each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Adult serum and placental globulin are more likely to cause reactions, but they are easier to purchase and obtain. Convalescent measles serum has almost no reactions, but most people are unwilling to have their measles-recovered children's blood drawn to protect others. Human serum globulin is widely used in the United States and has good results.</p>
<p>All of the above products must be injected within the first five or six days after infection (the first half of the incubation period), otherwise they cannot produce a protective effect. Furthermore, the immunity produced by the above methods is passive and can only last for up to eight weeks. If another measles patient is contacted three weeks later, reinfection can occur, and another injection should be administered. As for active immunization methods, after research by Lakka and Savir, there is hope for success soon.</p>
<p>(3) What are the Symptoms of Measles?</p>
<p>During a measles epidemic, whenever children who have not had measles develop cold symptoms, we must carefully observe and be vigilant about the occurrence of measles. Because the symptoms of measles in the first three or four days—the invasion period—are no different from ordinary upper respiratory tract inflammation. The patient begins to feel uncomfortable all over the body, with headache, fever, poor appetite, frequent sneezing, fear of light in the eyes, tearing, coughing, and hoarse crying. If the fever is too high in young infants, they may develop lethargy and convulsions. At this time, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed, but if there is a history of contact with someone who has measles, the possibility is very high. After 24-36 hours, the measles-specific Koplik's spots appear on the buccal mucosa of the child's cheek, near the molars. At this time, the doctor can confirm the diagnosis of measles.</p>
<p>The rash begins to appear on the third or fourth day of fever. It first appears at the hairline, behind the ears, and on the back of the neck, and then quickly spreads to the forehead, cheeks, and then the whole body. The rash is initially sparse, rose-red papules, which then increase, connect with each other, and the color becomes a little darker red. When the rash is at its peak, the fever rises to 104-105 degrees Fahrenheit, and the overall symptoms worsen. The rash subsides after three or four days, first in the areas where it appeared first, and fine, bran-like scales flake off. At this time, the fever gradually decreases, the child feels refreshed, and appetite gradually increases, until recovery, which takes three to four weeks.</p>
<p>(4) How to Take Care of a Child with Measles?</p>
<p>Shanghai lacks infectious disease hospitals, and ordinary pediatric wards cannot accommodate children with measles. Therefore, measles cases are often kept at home, and the doctor visits at most once a day. The rest of the care is entirely the responsibility of the mother or other family members.</p>
<p>(A) Room Equipment: Measles is a disease caused by a highly contagious virus. Therefore, the patient should be isolated from others. The fewer people coming and going in the room, the better, and everyone must wear a mask and wash their hands with disinfectant to reduce the chance of the child being infected with other bacteria.</p>
<p>The room should be simply furnished, with good air circulation and plenty of sunlight. But if the sunlight is too strong, a curtain can be hung to avoid direct sunlight. The indoor temperature should be below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, with suitable humidity. The child should absolutely rest in bed until fully recovered.</p>
<p>(B) Cleanliness First: I really don't understand the popular Chinese belief that "you can't wipe your face when you have measles." What is the basis for this? I really don't understand why parents do this so blindly, and they are not casual about it at all? So we often see children with measles who don't wipe their faces or wash their hands for days and nights, or even weeks, with their faces covered in eye discharge and nasal mucus. Does this really make the measles heal faster? No, definitely not. This only adds to the child's unnecessary suffering. On the contrary, during measles, because of inflammation of the respiratory tract, secretions from the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose increase, so you need to wash your face and rinse your mouth often to reduce bad breath and keep your face and mouth clean to avoid various eye and mouth inflammations, especially the dangerous gangrenous stomatitis. If you wait until the child's breath smells like feces, the cheeks break, and the teeth fall out, it will be too late to find a solution.</p>
<p>(C) Overthrow "Dietary Restrictions": Children with measles should drink more water, especially when the fever is very high and the appetite is poor. Easily digestible foods, especially milk and porridge, should still be provided as usual. Unless there is diarrhea, you can reduce the amount appropriately. When the fever decreases and the appetite increases, the diet should also increase accordingly. Eggs, broth, orange juice, and cod liver oil are especially important. Many ignorant parents often follow the instructions of quack doctors and strictly restrict the child's diet, giving the child nothing but some boiled water and fried rice soup, and some even prolong it for half a month or a month, even though the child has a good appetite. After a long time, the child's eyes can't open. If the treatment is too late, it can lead to blindness. This is xerophthalmia caused by vitamin A deficiency, which is rare in Europe and the United States, but is commonplace in measles cases in China. These are the consequences of "dietary restrictions." Even if the eyes are not affected, the child will only be a bag of bones after the measles is cured. If there is already tuberculosis, the tuberculosis bacteria will take the opportunity to become active and spread rapidly into miliary tuberculosis or tuberculous meningitis, leading to death. Other pyogenic bacteria, such as pneumococcus, hemolytic streptococcus, and staphylococcus, also get a good opportunity to produce various complications, such as laryngitis, otitis media, and bronchopneumonia, which can cause the patient to lose their life. Among them, bronchopneumonia is the greatest.</p>
<p>(D) Medicine Can Only Help a Little: Although there is still no specific medicine for measles, if the patient is healthy and well-cared for, without complications, they often recover on their own without sequelae. The use of medicine is only for symptomatic treatment. For example, if the skin is too itchy, you can apply diluted sodium bicarbonate water. If the fever is too high or there are neurological symptoms, you can use antipyretics and sedatives. If the cough is severe, use cough suppressants. If the throat is inflamed, use steam inhalation, etc. Sulfonamide chemicals, such as sulfathiazole or sulfapyridine (dia-clean), can be given in advance to prevent infections caused by streptococcus and pneumococcus. But these drugs must be taken under the guidance of a doctor. Parents should not be smart and use them arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Product Name Dosage Reaction</p>
<p>1. Human Serum Gamma Globulin 2-4 cc None</p>
<p>2. Measles Convalescent Serum 3-7 cc Almost None</p>
<p>3. Adult Whole Blood or Serum 20-30 cc More</p>
<p>4. Placental Globulin Preparation 5 cc More</p>
<h3>Starting from "Youth Psychological Cultivation"</h3>
<p>— Youxian</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Zan, the author of "Youth Psychological Cultivation," is one of the leading experts in psychological therapy in China, so I need not introduce him further. The material in this book is entirely based on his years of experience and insights gained from personally listening to the heart-wrenching complaints of young people at psychological clinics. Now, he has published these experiences and insights in simple and vivid language. He is telling us about the trials and tribulations that Chinese youth are encountering. These touching stories frankly point out that Chinese families, schools, society, and even the entire nation, are facing an extremely serious problem – the imbalance of interpersonal relationships! In fact, this not only causes suffering for young people but also leads to the decline of society as a whole, political corruption, factional disputes, and even the spread of civil war, all stemming from the failure to reasonably resolve the "imbalance of interpersonal relationships." It can provoke international disputes and disrupt world peace. Humanity cannot ignore this problem! The day of success may seem distant, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and climbing high begins from below. "Taking the first step" is essential!</p>
<p>Parents in the home and teachers in schools are, of course, directly responsible for the upbringing of children. However, the popularization of new knowledge and the removal of old habits are obviously difficult and require considerable time. Besides a few enlightened leaders in the cultural world, the most powerful promoters in the future should still be doctors.</p>
<p>Speaking of doctors, it makes one shudder! A careful perusal of the "Medical Q&amp;A" and "Social Services" sections of various newspapers and magazines reveals that seven or eight out of ten people who write in with questions about their illnesses are suffering from the friction of morbid psychology. It is pitiful that these narrow-minded doctors, who are inherently deficient and have suffered maladjustment, are unable to provide correct answers. Is "masturbation" really the main cause of "impotence" and "premature ejaculation"? Experts in psychoanalysis tell us that masturbation itself is not the problem; it is the fantasies that accompany it that are harmful to mental health. The object of these fantasies may be incestuous. The contradictions or sense of guilt in these abnormal fantasies, even the fear of masturbation, or the regret caused by being unable to quit masturbation, are the main causes of impotence. Sexual dysfunction is a common manifestation of many psychological illnesses. The real trauma lies within the soul.</p>
<p>"Neurasthenia" has become a very common diagnosis. But are the nerves of these patients really weak? Many are actually exhibiting signs of nervous hyper-sensitivity. They exaggerate their ailments excessively or find it difficult to tolerate minor discomfort. Their sympathetic nervous systems are affecting the function of their volitional nervous systems. In the subconscious depths of these patients' hearts, emotions that cannot be expressed are suppressed. That is the root of the illness. These unfortunate patients travel to hospitals and clinics of all sizes, spending countless amounts of money in vain, and chewing all kinds of secret remedies advertised, but the illness refuses to let them go. Finally, they turn to "medical advisors" and "social services" for help. See how earnestly and humbly they plead for help! They say, "I am a loyal reader of your newspaper. Since your newspaper added the Social Services section, the answers to various illnesses and treatments have been very detailed, benefiting people greatly and are worthy of admiration." How eagerly they await rescue! But in the end, the answers they receive are either "you must come to the clinic for an examination," or "take more tonics and strengthening agents," "long-term cold water baths," "cold water washing of the lower body," "continuous injections of 'Ciba-Geigy's Coramine' can be effective." Little do they know that they have already tried these wonderful prescriptions and remedies. Not one of the "great doctors" can point them to a clear path. Doctors are too neglectful of the psychological trauma of patients!</p>
<p>Not long ago, the author was talking to a young doctor about the problem of "neurasthenia," and he blurted out, "Ah! There are so many of them. I see two or three every day. It's really annoying, there's nothing I can do!" These doctors, fresh out of medical school, seem not to have studied psychiatry, and seem unaware of the existence of "psychoanalysis." The neglect of medical psychology in medical schools is evident.</p>
<p>According to experts, one-third of patients are suffering from psychological illnesses. Another one-third also have their physical pain aggravated by psychological problems. Therefore, it can be said that seven out of ten patients are suffering from the torment of psychological illnesses. It seems that most doctors are products of "anatomy," "pathology," "injections," and "surgery." They often forget that the patient lying in bed is a human being with emotions. Some medical educators have noticed the relationship between doctors and patients, but the association between emotional states and disease has received very little attention in China. In the United States, in the past decade, "psychosomatic medicine" has made rapid progress and has already laid a solid foundation. In order to catch up, our medical colleagues should no longer cling to old ways and seek answers to diseases solely within pathology. It is not easy to become an expert in psychoanalysis. However, having assumed the responsibility of diagnosing and treating sick "people," one must have considerable common sense about the emotions of these "people." Today's general practitioners should calmly ask themselves, "What is the difference between me and a veterinarian?"</p>
<p>Professor Edward Weiss of the Department of Internal Medicine at Temple University Medical School in the preface to his book "Psychosomatic Medicine" mentions that twenty years ago, when he left the field of pathology and entered the clinic, he encountered a young female patient suffering from headaches of unknown origin. Using his pathological knowledge and scientific spirit, he conducted all sorts of examinations and experiments, but could not find the cause of the headache. During the course of this research, he performed a lumbar puncture. After this simple procedure, the condition worsened. In addition to severe neck pain, she also developed lower back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient was bedridden for about nine months. During this period, countless examinations and experiments were performed, but the results were all negative. Finally, the patient's family could no longer bear it and decided to consult another old doctor. This old doctor was their family physician and had cared for the patient since childhood. He knew the point that the young scientist had overlooked. It turned out that the patient's brother, who was also the head of the family, had a girlfriend. The two were likely to get married. The sister did not approve of their marriage but could not oppose it. Her illness was a childish expression of resistance to this marriage. Once the cause was explained, she naturally recovered. This valuable lesson taught the young doctor that merely learning pathological knowledge is not enough to become a doctor. It prompted him to work hard to replenish his knowledge and re-educate himself.</p>
<p>Every day in clinical practice, we encounter many patients with unexplained ailments. Doctors either see them as fat sheep who have come to the door to be slaughtered at will or treat them as pathological specimens, focusing solely on research. They neglect that these beings have emotional problems. The "people" who are facing us with worried faces and complaining of various pains have emotions. Psychological trauma is tormenting two-thirds of the patients. Medicine is constantly being reformed. Doctors need to replenish their knowledge and re-educate themselves. Ask yourself: "Am I a veterinarian?"</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Beside the Water Mill</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>All around, are mountains, like screens. A stream flows down from the mountains, flowing very rapidly, making a gurgling sound.</p>
<p>There are no trees on the mountains; the withered yellow weeds grow like manes. Large stones show various strange shapes, scattered on the mountain peaks and at the foot of the mountains. In the mountain hollows, the light is very dim, and it is not easy to see the sunlight. In many deep places, the snow is still very thick.</p>
<p>Wild birds peck at the moss on the mountainside, occasionally uttering one or two cries. Their claws scratch the remaining snow, causing it to fall in a flurry.</p>
<p>The stream is very clear, and you can see many yellow stones at the bottom. The flowing water constantly impacts the stones, and their edges are polished smooth. Small fish dart and swim through the cracks between the rocks.</p>
<p>Beside the water, there is a small stone house. Its walls are made of large stones, and thin stone slabs serve as bricks and tiles. Two doors, front and back, are tightly closed, and weak light seeps in through the cracks in the stone.</p>
<p>On the side of the back door, there is a large wooden gear, a small part of which is immersed in the water. Inside the house, there are four stone mortars arranged. Horizontal beams and wooden wheels are connected tightly. The mortar body is made of wood, and one end is made of stone. In front of them, there are four stone troughs, the trough bodies are in the ground. The rapid current pushes the wooden wheels to rotate, thus connecting the mortars, which pound the rice grains inside in a rhythmic and orderly manner, like horses taking food from a trough.</p>
<p>This "water mill" was built jointly by several mountain villages nearby. They need it to constantly pound rice grains, especially during the winter months when almost every household needs to grind rice flour to make dumplings. Therefore, this mill does not stop day or night.</p>
<p>Xiao-e's mother also sits by the mortar day and night, sifting the flour. This flour is not her own; she is sifting it for others. She is like a tool for sifting rice flour.</p>
<p>In the year Xiao-e was born, Xiao-e's father was drafted by the Baojia chief, trained for a period, and sent to the front lines. From then on, he went farther and farther away, and needless to say, he never returned. After the victory, she received a letter from him saying that he would be home soon, but in fact, he still did not come back.</p>
<p>In these few years, she has been helping others with odd jobs to maintain the lives of herself and Xiao-e. Every winter, people rush back to celebrate the New Year, and every family pounds rice flour to prepare dumplings to eat. She has no rice flour to pound, she just helps others sift flour – filling one dou of flour, obtaining a small reward.</p>
<p>The light coming in from the small holes shines on Xiao-e's mother's dry, sallow face. Seeing her face, you would never believe she is only around thirty years old. She is wearing a pink cotton-padded jacket. This is her wedding dress, which she has been wearing for nine years. There are many holes in the jacket, and the yellow-black cotton protrudes from the holes, like wide-open, unfocused eyes.</p>
<p>She sits on the ground with a large bamboo sieve in front of her and a scoop in her hand. She scoops the crude, coarse flour into the scoop, and her hands shake and pat, letting the fine flour fall through the sieve holes into the bottom.</p>
<p>She has been sifting like this non-stop for three days and three nights. Her legs have long lost feeling, and her arms ache as if they have been sawn off. But she is still sifting, sifting. The rising flour gently climbs onto her hair, climbs onto her eyebrows… Her eyebrows and hair have turned white.</p>
<p>"How many dumplings are you preparing to make this year?"</p>
<p>"My family will make more than a dozen baskets, what about yours?"</p>
<p>"About the same. What kinds of fillings do you have?"</p>
<p>"We have shredded pork, date paste…"</p>
<p>"We have lard and white sugar…"</p>
<p>Xiao-e's mother listened to the conversations of the women next to her about dumplings, feeling a cold despair in her heart.</p>
<p>The wooden wheel is turning, making creaking sounds, as if lamenting, sighing.</p>
<p>Xiao-e jumped in from the door. The child, eight or nine years old, is quite tall, wearing an old blue cotton-padded robe with a very short hem.</p>
<p>"Mom, someone made a boat!" Xiao-e shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>His mother stared at him for a moment. She saw his flat face, flat nose, and thick lips, which were exactly like his father's.</p>
<p>"Mom, come and see!"</p>
<p>"What boat?"</p>
<p>"The boat I made with the wooden basin. I want to sit on it and go find Daddy to come back and eat dumplings! Mom, how many dumplings are we making?"</p>
<p>"Many, many!" Xiao-e's mother answered vaguely.</p>
<p>"I want to eat a hundred, two hundred, Daddy will eat even more! I want to sit on the boat and go find him!"</p>
<p>"Your father is on the other side of the river, far away from here, how can you get there?" Xiao-e became more and more excited.</p>
<p>"Why can't I? Doesn't the water behind us lead to the river? I can just sit on the boat, cross the river, and find him!"</p>
<p>"You don't even recognize your father?" – Two tears rolled down her cheeks and into the rice flour sieve, turning into two rolling flour beads.</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that Daddy's face is just like mine?"</p>
<p>"Your father has a wife and children on the other side of the river, he doesn't want you!" She said deliberately.</p>
<p>"No, it's not peaceful on the other side of the river, he can't come, and you can't go!" Mom couldn't bear the child to cry out loud, and hurriedly changed her words.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Late at night, the water mill has stopped running. Xiao-e's mother, unable to resist fatigue, fell asleep on a pile of straw in the corner, taking a rest.</p>
<p>She saw her husband come back. His clothes were wet.</p>
<p>"How did you come back?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I came back on a small boat!" her husband replied.</p>
<p>She smiled and woke up. The child sleeping beside her was snoring, and the sound of the flowing water outside was still gurgling.</p>

<h3>New Research on Hardy</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recently, two books about the British writer Thomas Hardy have been published in the United States, proving that Hardy's works are enduring and that readers still pay great attention to him. Both of these books discuss Hardy's novels. Lord Robert Cecil's "Hardy the Novelist" has already defined its scope. Carl J. Weber's "Hardy in America" also focuses on his prose and does not pay much attention to his poetry.</p>
<p>Some may say that this is biased and incomplete, but Hardy himself shared this opinion, as he despised his own novels and short stories. In 1916, when Harold Child was preparing to write a study of Hardy, he suggested to Child: "Please treat my poem (Dynasts) as my main work, and my novel as my accidental work. The opposite approach is much better. In fact, I write novels only passively, forced to write. Some sharp-eyed critics are also slowly paying attention to my poetry."</p>
<p>How was Hardy forced to write novels? At the age of twenty-seven, he wanted to devote himself to creative writing, feeling that an architect's office could not give him more opportunities. In London, he read Swinburne and Shelley and learned to write some poems himself, but after printing them, no one appreciated them. So, for money, he wrote novels and submitted them to companies such as Macmillan, but they returned his manuscripts, telling him that the trend in novels required complex plots. So, in order to become a novelist, Hardy carefully studied the popular novels of the time, especially those of Wilkie Collins. His sure dramatic sense, his understanding of atmosphere and layout, and his tight structure made his novels extraordinary, and his early works quickly gained a large readership.</p>
<p>Eventually, he was recognized by Leslie Stephen, the editor of "Cornhill," and his novels were published serially in this magazine, one after another, and his income and reputation gradually increased. Except for "Tess" and "Jude," it can be said that Hardy's novels were all written for money. The American "Harper's" magazine published a British edition, and Hardy's novels supported the scene. At that time, Hardy was seriously ill, struggling on the line of death, and still worked hard to write a long introduction for it. This event is also recorded in Weber's book.</p>
<p>One advantage of Tansel's work is that he does not devote much space to Hardy's philosophy and the sources of his works. He also talks about the situation of Hardy studies in American universities, which is surprising. In the past seventy-five years, only one professor in England has mentioned Hardy's works, but in the past forty years, there have already been at least one hundred and twenty-five papers on Hardy in the United States. Unfortunately, these papers mostly focus on Hardy's philosophy and the sources of his works. In fact, Hardy is not a philosopher, he is an artist who develops his views from his personal life experiences. Indeed, he read Schopenhauer and Hartmann in 1880, and twenty-five years earlier he had read the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, which gave his works a sentimental element, but this did not change his basic views.</p>
<p>Weber has been studying Hardy for many years, and he is very suitable to write "Hardy in America." He describes in detail Hardy's relationship with American publishers, the praise of him by American literary critics, his popularity among American readers, and the enthusiasm of American universities for studying Hardy, all of which are recorded in detail and are very convenient to consult.</p>
<h3>Peasant Figure</h3>
<p>— Watteau</p>
<p>Watteau (Watteau) was a talented painter born in 1684 in a small village near the Belgian border, Valenciennes. He became famous at the age of nineteen and was extremely active in the Paris art scene. He was a key figure in the so-called Rococo movement. His early works were influenced by Rubens, and the atmosphere of his works was more serious. His later works, because he was good at dealing with nobles and lived in a high-class environment, reflected luxury, splendor, leisure, and freedom in his works, becoming genre paintings of the time. "Peasant Figure" is a product of the transition from the early to the later period and is a representative work of his fame. The work is now in the Louvre. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Random Talk about Couplets</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>When Weng Songchan was dying, he wrote a couplet for himself: "If I hear the Tao in the morning, I can die in the evening. From now on, I know I should strive to go!" He asked Zhang Zhidong to write it. Zhidong was Songchan's favorite student. When Weng passed away, he also offered a eulogy couplet: "What can the public do? You could have been Zhu Daxing, but you were not even as good as Li Wenzheng. It is not enough to tell! Why has there been a party to pass down? Perhaps you are expected to be a wild person. Zhu Daxing's name was 筠, Li Wenzheng, Li Hongzao, and Weng were all imperial teachers. In terms of learning, Weng was better than Li, and Weng was Wen Gong and also died earlier than Li. Therefore, Zhidong was calling out to his teacher.</p>
<p>When Sun Jiazao's home was in ruins, a student named Wang wrote a eulogy couplet: "This is true reason, without the name of reason, pitiful is a generation of upright officials, sailing across the East Sea. Only the ancient ministers, the friends of the ministers, recalling the twenty years of sincere people, always accompanied Yushan." The East Sea refers to Xu Tongxuan, and Yushan refers to Weng Songhong. Weng hated Jiazao, so he was sarcastic about his strength.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 171</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Behind him was the little tiger, with the body of a child and the size of an adult. Because he was half a head taller, he seemed a little afraid that we would see him, so he lowered his head slightly, but from behind Yao Xuan's flowing hair, half a pair of eyes were revealed, blinking for a moment. The third person, standing behind the two people, stood towering, taller than the two by almost half a body, thick and strong, standing straight, somewhat like a pagoda. That was "04," named Shen Youwen; according to him, he was still a branch of the Korean royalty. Looking at his tall cheekbones and strong jaw, I knew it was not easy for him to open his mouth. No wonder he spoke so stutteringly, one word every half day, making people anxious for him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gu, Mr. Yue, are you two going out? … We came at an awkward time, didn't we?" Yao Xuan's voice was so crisp and sweet, yet rich in charm, unlike the delicate and thin voices of girls; she and Ping Pingzi, one came from the Jing dialect of Japan, and the other was a native of the Northeast sorghum land. Asking two questions, both were interrogative, a typical Northeast accent.</p>
<p>"It's nothing, it's nothing." Gu Jian saw Yao Xuan and also picked up some Northeast accent, "Because I have some free time, I thought of going to Xiehe Hospital to visit Engineer Wu. Please come in and sit down, it's still early anyway."</p>
<p>Yao Xuan hesitated slightly, then turned around, took the little tiger, and stepped into the house together, "Today is Saturday. The hospital is usually open from two to four o'clock, I just came back with my little brother."</p>
<p>"That's right," I hurriedly replied; because just as He Jian and the guests were entering the door, I heard Ping Pingzi's words, and she rolled her eyes at me, meaning I had messed up the hospital's opening hours. "Yes, Xiehe's rules are that Monday to Friday it's 5 p.m.; I didn't expect today to be Saturday, I was almost confused by these two days of big events."</p>
<p>"Is there anything wrong?" He Jian saw that "04" was still standing outside the door, neither advancing nor retreating.</p>
<p>"It's nothing, the doorbell rang just now. …" "04" paused on each word.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's cancelled—originally it was an important matter, now I'm not going out," I explained to "04" on behalf of He Jian.</p>
<p>"Good fellow," He Jian looked at the little tiger as he entered the house, grabbed one of his hands, and examined it repeatedly, sighing like this, "It's even more powerful than an iron fork, sliding in, it can even insert into someone's stomach, … the Japanese wouldn't believe it; they would definitely say it's a myth. … I really want to see you do it sometime to open my eyes!" He Jian's face was full of envy.</p>
<p>"I didn't believe it much until I saw it myself," I thought of that night, when the little tiger took down that Japanese deputy captain and the car driver.</p>
<p>"There are people who are even more powerful than Tiger Brother," Yao Xuan giggled, "There are several people in Tiger Brother's association who can do this, it's not unusual. … The year before last, an old man came to the association, he was so skinny that he looked unlike himself, but his fingers could even poke a hole in a hard rock, it's really unbelievable."</p>
<p>"Ah, the world is so big, there is really no end to wonders!" Gu Jian sighed with some emotion, "Not believing is also 'a summer insect cannot speak of ice' … oh, I remember, Yue Ping Mentioned earlier that Tiger Brother can disarm a gun with his bare hands, what kind of skill is that… come, try it and show me, I want to learn this trick…" Gu Jian said, immediately pulling the little tiger to the middle of the room, a four- or five-foot square open space.</p>

<h3>Post-War Germany: Feminine Ascendancy and Masculine Decline - Seeking Husbands Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Reuters Duferth Correspondent for this Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>"Marriage is my greatest wish for 1947. I am an attractive young woman, 38 years old. My hobbies are art, music, theater, and movies... I now need a 40-year-old man to hold me in his strong arms, but his height cannot exceed five feet five inches."</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, Germany, love is being mediated through advertisements.</p>
<p>This city is the location of the American occupation forces. On the notice boards at street corners, brightly colored advertisements are posted. Besides advertisements for rentals and employment, there are also advertisements seeking husbands and wives. In Germany, indeed, there are more women than men; the ratio of female to male is six to one. Therefore, there are many seeking husbands, but very few seeking wives. Their conditions focus on the financial status of the other party and their relationship with the Nazis.</p>
<p>A Heart, a Pair of Rings</p>
<p>A small, pink advertisement. On it are drawn two concentric hearts intertwined with wedding rings. The content is as follows: "Marriage is my greatest wish for 1947. I am an attractive young woman, 38 years old. My hobbies are art, music, theater, and movies. I have a lot of money, and also a passionate heart. I now need a 40-year-old man to hold me in his strong arms, but his height cannot exceed five feet five inches."</p>
<p>No Nazis Need Apply</p>
<p>Another more practical woman wrote a short and to-the-point article: "I am not a beauty queen, but I have a hotel and a very well-equipped home. Is there anyone willing to be my business partner and husband there? No Nazis need apply, and those under forty years of age should not try!"</p>
<p>In addition to newspaper-style advertisements, marriage agencies are also advertising extensively. A recent advertisement said: "Do you want to be a lucky wife? We can introduce you to the following: (1) Landowner, 48 years old, (2) Textile merchant, 36 years old, (3) Grocery store owner, 48 years old. Photos available. Please come and see."</p>
<p>Matchmakers do not like marriages to take place in autumn and winter because housing and food are scarce. How can one honeymoon in hunger and cold? In the bright spring weather, although supplies are still lacking, a warm heart will eventually overcome the cold head. (7)</p>
<h3>Lingzhi Mushroom</h3>
<p>— Gao Minggui</p>
<p>The other day, Zhejiang University held a Lingzhi mushroom charity exhibition on the second floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. This Lingzhi mushroom was discovered by Professor Qi Guangyu of Zhejiang University near Lover's Bridge on Qinwang Mountain in Hangzhou and transplanted into a crumbling tile pot. The outside of the pot was wrapped with white silk and placed in a glass box. The price was set at 50 million yuan, and it has not yet been purchased. According to reports: "From a distance, the Lingzhi mushroom is no different from ordinary mushrooms, but upon closer inspection, it is different. Its cap is not fully formed, missing about a quarter of the circle. The stem grows on one side and is about three inches long. It has a luster like ancient bronze and no patterns. The stem has cloud patterns, and its color is rusty, like bronze artifacts unearthed from the Shang Dynasty. The bottom of the cap is a layer of iridescent colors, as if it has been growing for a very long time."</p>
<p>The school's "Initiation" contains research on Lingzhi, saying: "芝 (zhi), 木作之 (mu zuo zhi), pictogram depicting the shape of grass growing. 雜說 (Za Shuo) says: '芝 (zhi) is grass, it sprouts three times a year.' Wang Chong's Lunheng says: '芝 (zhi) grows in fertile soil, where the soil's energy is harmonious, hence auspicious Lingzhi grass grows.' Lingzhi's shape and texture are very different; it is fragrant and glossy, without hair. Lingzhi has a stalk and its back has light. Its texture is soft, while Lingzhi is firm and uniquely outstanding..."</p>
<p>According to the author, Lingzhi is also a type of fungus. The difference is that other fungi are parasitic on other plants, while Lingzhi grows independently. Lingzhi does not have much value in biology. Its preciousness lies only in the difficulty of finding it, and that it is rare. According to legend, Lingzhi receives the essence of the sun and moon, and spiritual energy every day. It grows in remote mountains and has been around for a long time. It can bear fruit, shaped like a baby, called "He Shou Wu". Lingzhi that is over a thousand years old can transform into human, horse, and other shapes, producing inspiration, and can move away from its original plant. People who cultivate the Tao, if they eat it, can "increase five hundred years of Taoist practice" and "quickly achieve enlightenment". Ordinary people who eat it can also preserve their longevity and achieve immortality. Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered Xu Fu to go to the "Penglai Immortal Island" in Dongying (Japan) to search for the elixir of immortality, which was this thing. Xu Fu, knowing that he would be killed by the First Emperor if he failed his mission, lived out his days in a foreign land. We often see this kind of bizarre and strange legend in mythical novels.</p>
<p>These kinds of legends are probably just like the stories of Qi Dongye and are not reliable. Otherwise, 50 million yuan would not be expensive. There are many wealthy people in Shanghai who have countless fortunes and are desperate to find a way to avoid death, and they would definitely flock to it and snap it up. Moreover, what Zhejiang University obtained was only a Lingzhi mushroom, not an "He Shou Wu" or "Lingzhi fruit" that had become a spirit. No wonder the price of 50 million yuan is still "unattended".</p>
<p>Tragically, the poor students waiting for relief have had very poor results from this exhibition. The number of charity sales and purchases is also very small, and many people must be very disappointed. Shanghai's wealthy are not interested in academic exhibitions. To hold a charity event, one must trot out women to rally support in order to get them to "generously donate" and "return satisfied", saying, "This money was well spent." The organizers will definitely achieve remarkable results, and both parties will be "delighted" and achieve a satisfactory result. With people's hearts like this, what is the use of fairness!</p>
<p>I think that the authorities at Zhejiang University set the price of the Lingzhi mushroom a bit too high. The wealthy are unwilling to spend 50 million yuan to buy a weed and take it back to study, and scholars of biology cannot afford such a high price, disappointing the auspicious Lingzhi and countless poor students waiting for scholarships, and they have to "return disappointed".</p>

<h3>New Defenses Between Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Kui Yuan</p>
<p>After reading "The Nanjing Massacre"</p>
<p>People of a certain age may still remember that in small cities, theaters and bookstores used to clearly indicate "Male Seating" and "Female Seating" with red paper to show "civilization," and such decorations were also often included in "civilized wedding" ceremonies. The situation was much the same in Shanghai, the "Ten-Mile Foreign Concession." Ladies and grandmothers of wealthy families would, as a rule, sit in the box seats when going to the theater. As for men and women sitting together indiscriminately on streetcars, it was denounced by moralists as uncouth, or, to put it another way, as being quite vulgar. This is because we have always emphasized the strict separation of men and women, although the blame always falls on women. However, in terms of "Male Seating" and "Female Seating," it seems quite fair to divide them into two camps to avoid "improper contact between the sexes," and to have them each guard their territory.</p>
<p>Ethics aside, "Male Seating" and "Female Seating" only exist in public places. Outside of these places, anything goes. Therefore, this method is not necessarily perfect. However, I had previously wondered what this so-called "strict separation" was all about, until I discovered the boundaries and finally understood: "So that's how it is."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this system of boundaries has declined considerably over the years. I don't think it exists in Shanghai anymore. Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know what it's like in the countryside or inland areas. This is truly quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Someone once advocated for dividing swimming pools in Shanghai with wooden boards to separate men and women. These boards would, of course, be a defense line. However, the world is not a swimming pool, so how can we put up wooden boards everywhere? As a result, it seems that swimming pools still don't have wooden boards. Although those who worry about the world are well-intentioned, it is difficult to reverse deeply ingrained habits. Seeing the situation today, much effort has already been wasted.</p>
<p>There is also another layer: does this so-called "strict separation" mean that men should guard against women? Or that women should guard against men? Or that both sides should guard against each other? This is also an issue that has been neglected in research over the years.</p>
<p>A Joke</p>
<p>I remember a joke: A strange man and woman were traveling together and stayed at the same inn for the night, but there was only one room with a single bed. The man said, "Let's just sleep in the same bed." The woman said, "How can we do that!" The man said, "It's okay, we'll each sleep under a quilt." After they fell asleep, the man suddenly crossed the line. The woman said, "Didn't you say we would be separated by a quilt?" The man said, "It's okay, we're still separated by clothes."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the issue of defense is truly too subtle and too difficult to research. However, at this point, if we are talking about strict separation, then women need to be strictly defensive. Considering China's national conditions, the responsibility lies with women, which reminds me of the chastity belts displayed in the Musée de Cluny in Paris. Its opening and closing mechanism is like the shorts worn by strongmen when they show off their skills, except that these are made of metal. To put it more plainly, it is a metal chastity belt that extends all the way to the buttocks, with two holes opened in the front, each with serrated edges. This is a famous artifact from the European Middle Ages. If a patriotic friend encounters Europeans making fun of our bound feet or something else, they can hold up this kind of thing and point it at their noses as revenge.</p>
<p>The advantage of this thing, it is said, is that it is not like ordinary pants, but is locked at the abdomen. This metal contraption is certainly very strong, but the key cannot be held by the woman, otherwise she would be suspected of colluding with the enemy. Once the contraption is still secure, but the defense line has already been lost, as with the principle of "fire prevention," it is truly very unsettling.</p>
<p>If industrialists can design something similar, it would probably not be difficult to design something comparable to this chastity belt, specifically for men. And if all the keys were handed over to people who are respected in society and who have always shaken their heads and sighed, or even if a nationwide committee were elected using China's new methods to take control, then the issue of strict separation between men and women would be solved very practically. If they were to do it even more actively, they could ask this committee to offer a reward to solicit an invention, just like the people of Northeast China in the puppet Manchukuo era had to wear "Concord Uniforms," and put all men and women in an invention—let's call it "Strict Separation Uniform." This uniform would be made of metal or some other material, with steel thorns hidden inside, and perhaps have a magnetic property, so that if a man wearing it touched a woman, the magnetic property would cause steel thorns to emerge all over his body; the same would happen to a woman who touched a man. And the clothes would be locked with a lock, with the keys managed by the committee or someone else. With such double protection, whether it is men guarding against women, women guarding against men, or both sides guarding against each other, it would no longer be an issue.</p>
<p>In today's world of rampant materialism, I cannot avoid being a materialist. As for promoting morals, I always feel it is somewhat subtle and intangible. If we say that men and women should be strictly separated, I think this materialist approach may not be meaningless.</p>
<p>A Matter of Ethics</p>
<p>Reading the Shen Bao of the 26th month, there was a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing saying that a "shocking massacre" occurred during the Lunar New Year. If the massacre is great and shocking, how does it compare to the massacres on the battlefield? So I had to continue reading. "...Li was young and lecherous, and had long had improper thoughts about his aunt, who was alone in an empty house. At about 10 p.m. on the night of the incident, Li You was in another room, and Li took the opportunity to enter the deceased's bedroom, intending to rape her. He was rejected by Zhang, and became angry and resentful. He took a kitchen knife and severely injured Zhang. People in the outer room heard the noise and rushed over, and Li was still standing there blankly. He was arrested by the police. After three days of interrogation, he confessed to the crime of attempted rape and murder." And Zhang had already "died of her injuries that night after the incident." "The Central Daily News specifically published an editorial today calling for 'establishing new defenses between men and women' to correct social ethics." It can also be seen that "defenses between men and women"</p>
<p>I don't know how old this Mr. Li Yanchang is this year. I think his life is probably over. He swung his knife at his aunt, and now others will swing their knives at him. This time it's about ethics, and it's not necessarily the woman's fault. Alas, defenses between men and women. What to do? Still morality?</p>
<h3>Foreign Lucky Child, the Second "Wang Didi"</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The only survivor on the Shen Hang No. 145 passenger plane that crashed in western Hubei was a sixteen-month-old baby, Paul Wick, the child of an American missionary. After China Airlines transported him back to Shanghai by special plane, he was sent to Hong En Hospital for treatment. This news caused a sensation in the Shanghai press, and many reporters went to Hong En Hospital to take photos of Paul. In the end, they all met with closed doors. But finally, An Lisen, a Shanghai-based photojournalist for the New York Times, took the only photo.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, Paul Wick was taken care of by the American United Church office. After recovering, he was sent back to the United States for upbringing according to his grandparents' wishes.</p>
<p>Little Paul and another Wang Didi both survived a great disaster. Their future achievements are quite interesting.</p>
<h3>Differences Between Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Renewal</p>
<p>A woman strikes a match outwards, while a man strikes it towards himself. When a woman examines her fingernails, she opens her palm to look at the whole hand, while a man bends his fingers to look specifically at the nails. A woman looks around the room first, then focuses on a particular corner, while a man looks directly at that corner. When a woman drinks water, she always looks at the person standing opposite her, while a man looks at the water in his glass.</p>

<p>As soon as prices reach the "border," they "exit the border," and then "knock on the border"; how hurried!</p>
<p>The lives of ordinary people are passing through a "difficult pass," called "crossing the border"; it is a matter of "intercourse" with life!</p>
<p>Tuition is high, "talking about books is high."</p>
<p>Schools are about to open, and tuition is as high as hundreds of thousands, is it really "all professions are lowly, only studying is high"?</p>
