<h3>美國修訂援華步驟魏使報告不予公布　王外長離美今晚抵東京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕對美國務院聲明魏德進中韓調查結果之機密報告不予發表一事，外交</p>
<p>部拒加評論。且於美國聲明之末所稱；「若此時公布該報告，則周不妥，且對於各有關國家之</p>
<p>利益實有損害」一語之用意性質，亦不予論列。據權威人士觀察，美官方不發表魏氏報告，其</p>
<p>動機已於此一註釋中透露，美國必已於加緊馬歇爾援歐計劃實施之同時，鄭重考慮及其選東政</p>
<p>策。關於韓國部份，已可自近來美國在聯大會中所表示之堅定立塲與强化行動中見其端倪，故</p>
<p>美國對華政策亦必不致再久懸不決。自去歲十月底政府與共方和談破裂及今春馬帥離華以迄於</p>
<p>今，美國已自若干並非輕鬆之事件及情勢中得悉其含糊政策造成之相當嚴重惡果，相信三外長</p>
<p>在美與杜奮門總統馬散爾國務鄉及洛粗特代國務卿等頻頻懇談之結果，必已就中國現在一般之</p>
<p>經濟政治，軍事形勢廣泛交換意見。美國對華政策之修訂及援華步驟之採擇之揭曉時期，當在</p>
<p>不遠。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿日電〕美國務院廿日宣稱，魏德適將軍對於中國與朝鮮之報告，此刻將不</p>
<p>予發表，國務院聲明的全文如下：外界刻正力促將九月中魏德邁將軍自遠束返國後所作之報告</p>
<p>予以公布，按杜魯門總統七月派遺魏德邁將軍，以其私人代表資格前往中國與朝鮮，調查該兩</p>
<p>國之局勢，九月魏氏完成任務返國後，即向總統與國務院提出其調查所得之機密報告，甚多情</p>
<p>報係獲自中國與朝鮮私人與在兩國之美國代表以及中國政府高級官員，故此時若公布該報告則</p>
<p>屬不當，且對於各有關國家﹝包括美國）之利益，寳有損害也。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿日電〕據非正式方面稱：魏德邁之報告書，提出蘇聯有在六個月內接管員中</p>
<p>國束九省全部之危險，並建議我支援中國蔣主席領導之政府，主張採用類似援助希臘。土耳其計</p>
<p>劃之鉅額援助計劃。魏氏報告書中之若干點，與馬歇爾使華後所提之建議，曾有衝突。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕杜魯門總統上週曾稱：國務卿馬歇爾關於魏德邁之報告，在數日之</p>
<p>內，即將發表聲明。廿日國務院之聲明發表，顯爲履行總統之諾言。此事足以表示，馬歇爾關</p>
<p>於美國對華之未來政策聲明，可能尚有若干時期之延擱。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿日電〕中國外長兼出席聯合國大會代表團長王世杰博士，廿日離美，約於廿</p>
<p>二日下午七時一刻（東京時間）可抵東京。</p>
<h3>中暹空運協定草案　立法院討論通過　鹽稅率調整辦法案緩議</h3>

<p>論有關稅收及選舉案廿餘件，爲</p>
<p>復會以來較忙之一日。會議由孫</p>
<p>兼院長主席，通過要案有：　中</p>
<p>選空中運輸協定草案，　善後事</p>
<p>業委會組織條例案，　修正房捐</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕立院廿</p>
<p>一日晨討論鹽稅稅率調整辦法及</p>
<p>提高各項地方稅率案時，多數立</p>
<p>委對於政府增加人民負担，未符</p>
<p>公平原則，致貧民負担過鉅，且</p>
<p>若十稅率之調整，事先又未完成</p>
<p>立法程序，與法諸多不合，頗表</p>
<p>不滿，結果懸稅稅率調整辦法案</p>
<p>緩議。修正筵席及娛樂稅法案，</p>
<p>重付審查。</p>
<h3>立院決請政府注意選舉舞弊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕防止選</p>
<p>舉舞弊應否另定單行法規案，廿</p>
<p>一日晨於立院例會再度提出時，</p>
<p>又引起一塲激辨，反對另立新法</p>
<p>者，其主要理由爲關於選舉舞弊</p>
<p>之處罰刑法及有關選舉法規已有</p>
<p>規定，似無庸另行訂定。王毓祥</p>
<p>，陳紫楓指出，我國當前辦理選</p>
<p>舉，「控制極嚴」，爲一稱自上</p>
<p>而下之選舉，立院殊不必多此一</p>
<p>舉。林彬提出折衷竟見，說明自</p>
<p>前制定單行法時間已不許可，立</p>
<p>院除應呈請國府轉令各主管機關</p>
<p>，遇有選舉舞弊情事發生，應依</p>
<p>法認眞執行，更應請司法警察，</p>
<p>法院檢察官，監察委員，監察使</p>
<p>積極注意舞弊情事之發生，並應</p>
<p>獎勵社會糾舉，以爲憲政樹立揩</p>
<p>模。最後，照林彬意見通過。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日常〕上海市</p>
<p>參議會等，前以直轄市地位重要</p>
<p>，不能與縣市視爲同等區城，會</p>
<p>電請中央，要求直轄市之區應各</p>
<p>還生國大代表一名。此案子廿一</p>
<p>日於立院例會提出。多數立委以</p>
<p>國大代表之產生，憲法以縣市爲</p>
<p>單位，未有直轄市與省轄市之分</p>
<p>，至直轄市之區，與縣市之同等</p>
<p>區域，其性質亦不相同，所請似</p>
<p>無法律可以依據，未得通過。</p>
<h3>政院決議案　任命北洋東大兩校長</h3>

<h3>中國地位　日見强大　英「經濟學者」評論</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿一日電〕</p>
<p>英國有勢力週刋「經濟學者」本</p>
<p>星期有長篇主評，討論中國政策</p>
<p>及其在世界事務中之基本地位。</p>
<p>該文中有云：「今日在中國誠有</p>
<p>一中央政府，其權力遠較一九一</p>
<p>九年或一九二一年之北京政府爲</p>
<p>大，但於長期抗日戰爭之後，繼</p>
<p>以內戰及經濟紊亂，已削弱中國</p>
<p>地位，使其在國際上僅具大國之</p>
<p>名，而無其實。然即在現時，低</p>
<p>佔中國在國際事務中舉足輕重之</p>
<p>因素，實爲極大錯誤。中國如一</p>
<p>巨人，尚半醒半睡，然無改其爲</p>
<p>巨人，若與廿五年前華盛頓會議</p>
<p>時之情勢作一比較，已有極大進</p>
<p>步，而中國外交界人士亦對未來</p>
<p>抱有頗大信心，且數年戰爭已使</p>
<p>中國獲得一種法律上之地位，至</p>
<p>今仍爲一種有力賢產」。</p>

<h3>社論　中央一般關係的檢討</h3>
<p>英國議會訪華團在北方游壓之後，昨晨由我</p>
<p>全國著名風景區之杭州，飛抵本市。他們到滬之</p>
<p>後，拜訪市長而外，首先招待中外記者，並應市</p>
<p>參議會之約，參與午宴，彼此交換意見。我們对</p>
<p>佳賓的巡廻考察，並聆聽他們在各地所發表的言</p>
<p>論，感覺到無上欣慰。本報昨雖對內河航權問題</p>
<p>已有所論列，但願在佳賓返國以前，更對中英間</p>
<p>的一般關係提供我們的觀點。</p>
<p>第一，我們感覺到中英兩國共同之點甚多，</p>
<p>而所遭遇的困難，亦復相似。我們衷心地佩服英</p>
<p>國友人。他們實在是刻苦精動，有計劃，有勇氣</p>
<p>，有步驟地應付一重一重的難關。英國友人這些</p>
<p>舉動，可供我們效法之處茶多。我們朝野上下，</p>
<p>都願隨時以英國朋友的作法自勉與自勵。惟其中</p>
<p>英有許多共同點，所以也只有英國朋友，最能瞭</p>
<p>解體會中國的困難與其癥結所在。我們不必一一</p>
<p>覆述諸位嘉賓連日在報紙上披露的話語，我們只</p>
<p>感覺到一種親切與共鳴。</p>
<p>第二，我們瞧當提出的是：英國在今天，雖</p>
<p>然經濟上空前困窘，國力大喪，元氣一時不易恢</p>
<p>復：而英國在世界尤其歐洲政治上，仍居極重要</p>
<p>的地位。隊洲的局面，眞是百孔千瘡，搖搖欲墜</p>
<p>。共產國際，乘慮蹈隙，淹有半壁江山，一舉置</p>
<p>之「鐵慕」以內。美國雖然以無比雄厚的力量，</p>
<p>倡導援歐，而在精神上作中流砥柱，力挽狂瀾，</p>
<p>與美國聲應氣求的，現在遝只有英國。英國在歐</p>
<p>洲的處境，正與中國在亞洲相同。中國今日，國</p>
<p>家遭逢空前惡劣的劫運，然而只要中國獨立自主</p>
<p>一天不喪失，赤色的毒燄，終無法在亞洲肆虐，</p>
<p>遠東一局的安寗也終不可搖撼。今天中英兩國的</p>
<p>處境，眞所謂「風雨如晦，雞鳴不已」，其心情</p>
<p>的沉重，不是局外人所能喻。</p>
<p>第三，我們認為英國人的識力與目光，是値</p>
<p>得欽佩的。抗戰八年，以迄今茲，遠東的大局，</p>
<p>變幻萬端，中國的處境，危疑震撼。國際上多少</p>
<p>批評與毀譽！惟獨英國，這許多年來，對我們沒</p>
<p>有過情之譽，亦沒有求全之毀。他們總是以冷靜</p>
<p>的觀察，平心靜氣地說出平情之論，這是值得我</p>
<p>們感念的。</p>
<p>我們對於英訪華團諸君的蒞臨。簡單地說。</p>
<p>是寄以無窮的希望。我們認為今後遠柬的安寗，</p>
<p>中英的諒解與合作，亦正如中美的合作互助，同</p>
<p>其重要。對於英國政府最近殖民地政策的改變，</p>
<p>我們尤認為極其明智之舉。或許有人會因此慨歎</p>
<p>大英帝國的衰落，殊不知英國此種舉動，為大不</p>
<p>列顚平添若干好戚與同情，這種心理上的收穫，</p>
<p>豈是那般迷戀殘骸的人所能估計：英國現政府人</p>
<p>物高瞻遠矚，目光四射，他們又豈是專門只打眼前狹隘的算盤？</p>
<p>此外還有一點，本報昨日社論已經提到，而</p>
<p>今天願再加申述的，就是有關中國內河航行權問</p>
<p>題。英國友人的見解，中國內河航行，似不妨對</p>
<p>英開放，因英國內河航行，亦對他國開放，並謂</p>
<p>中國的船，呼以到紐約波士頓多瑙河，何以英國</p>
<p>的船不能到中國內地港？據我們所知，世界各國</p>
<p>，開放內河的，只有英國一國。但事實上近上百</p>
<p>五十年來世界航海權，完全操持在英國手中，所</p>
<p>以英內河雖開放，而並無一國船雙加以利用。其</p>
<p>他國家，對內河航權，都是保護的。即與英同文</p>
<p>向種又同為海權巨強的美國，對內河航行權，也</p>
<p>是保護的。不特保護內河航權，並且在鐵路局方</p>
<p>面，訂出檢查法，促使出口貨物，專用美國船隻</p>
<p>裝運，以免利權外溢。這是一點。其次，如果以</p>
<p>中國船可以到紐約，波士頓為例，則外國船現在</p>
<p>赤可到上海·廣州。上海距吳淞口十五里，並非</p>
<p>海港，但其不能喻為內河航權的關放，則毫無可</p>
<p>疑。這是二點。至若以多瑙河為喻，則吾人均知</p>
<p>多瑙河乃國際孔道，非任何內河可比。這是三點</p>
<p>。準此三點，我們始終認為內河航行權的應加保</p>
<p>護，是無法更易的。當然，這樣倣來，劉我們國</p>
<p>家經濟上，是一個沉重的負祖。因為外來重要物</p>
<p>資，如果可以通到內地各港如南京·漢口等地，</p>
<p>便可免去上海的起卸轉口之費。而這筆費，以上</p>
<p>海物價之高波動之烈，往往比由英國運來的整個運費還要貴。不過我們得聲明，這是有關國家</p>
<p>政策的問題，而不能斤斤於國家經濟的是否合算</p>
<p>。我們這種立場，凡是在國家經濟和對外貿易上</p>
<p>作過艱苦奮鬥的國家，都能共喻。英國在這方面</p>
<p>，亳無疑義的是先進。我們的立場，相信終究可</p>
<p>以得到他們的共鳴的。</p>
<p>英國訪華團的來華，最近十年來，這是第二</p>
<p>次。第一次是在戰時。我們報人在重慶的嘉陵新</p>
<p>村，曾與英國的佳賓晤面。此後中國即有訪英關</p>
<p>的成行。流光迅速，瞬已數載。今天的局面，與</p>
<p>那時不同。而正如上海市參議會昨午歡迎席上所</p>
<p>說，橫在我們前面的困難，有賴中英雙方共同奪</p>
<p>鬥的，却依然很多。我們願提出乘諸位佳賓休沐</p>
<p>歸來之暇，共同研究，共同策勵。</p>

<p>間題，本團不便答覆。　英國之</p>
<p>戰時損失及夜元計劃，英國在戰</p>

<p>百分之四十七，海外投資之損失</p>
<p>在牛數以上，且對外債務激增，</p>

<h3>招待英國會訪華團席上　潘議長歡迎辭全文</h3>
<p>（上接一版）潘議長在招待英訪華</p>
<p>團席致歡迎辭，全文如次：</p>
<p>英國議會訁華團諸位先生，吳市</p>
<p>，諸位來賓：今天公展有機會代表上</p>
<p>海市參議會，歡迎英國議會訪華團，</p>
<p>深感榮幸與愉快。我相信參議會各同</p>
<p>人一定與我一樣的感到特別別別的愉快，</p>
<p>因為以一個地方議會的份子而言，我</p>
<p>們常把英國的立法制度視作「議會之</p>
<p>母」的。我敢設想，諸位先生蒞臨上</p>
<p>海後，有一種特別親切之感，好像到</p>
<p>了家裏一樣，因為一百多年來，上海</p>
<p>是中外人士合作，尤其是巾英合作最</p>
<p>顯著的地點，在過去一世紀中，中英</p>
<p>兩國人士在上海的合作，造成經濟工</p>
<p>商文化上的很大進步，而使中外人士</p>
<p>同蒙其益。今天我以市參議會議長的</p>
<p>地位，在這裏代表說出所有參議員同</p>
<p>人的感覺，就是上海的環境目前雖有</p>
<p>改變，中英人民乃至中外人士間的合</p>
<p>作精神，將因不平等條約的取消而更</p>
<p>加發揚光大。上海是個國際都市，我</p>
<p>們既為上海的民選代表，亦決不想去</p>
<p>尋求實施一個「閉關」的政策，我們</p>
<p>希望國際合作造成更偉大，更繁榮，</p>
<p>更美麗的上海，所有上海居民，應不</p>
<p>分國籍與信仰作共同的努力，使上海</p>
<p>成為一個值得他們自己驕傲的城市。</p>
<p>在許多方面，上海的現狀與中國的</p>
<p>大局有關，市民除深受通貨膨脹及物</p>
<p>養不足的痛苦外，尚有別有居心者，</p>
<p>以花言巧語，作種稱有害上海安定之</p>
<p>言論，今日上海之基本困難問題，如</p>
<p>物資供應與貿易之遭受阻窒，必須俟</p>
<p>中共放棄其以武力為政爭工具之方法</p>
<p>後，方能獲得根木之解決。</p>
<p>我相信諸位先生在旅途之中，當會</p>
<p>看到其他各國的許多城市，其所遭受</p>
<p>的破壞，比上海更甚，在純物質的觀</p>
<p>點上說，上海似乎是極端幸連的，但</p>
<p>是以一個有機體的都市而言，則已創</p>
<p>鉅痛深了。在八年抗戰，四年淪陷之</p>
<p>下，過去上海市政府及公共租界，法</p>
<p>租界工部局多年努力所造成的市政組</p>
<p>繼和公益事業，均陷於解體的狀態，</p>
<p>在此期巾，上海馬路失修，公園荒蕪</p>
<p>，下水道工程因無保養而致損壞，當</p>
<p>勝利後，吾常局接收滬市時，上海不</p>
<p>再是以往內容充賓，秩序井然的城市</p>
<p>，而是一個公私組織解體，徒留殘壳</p>
<p>的都市而已。重建上海，工作艱巨，</p>
<p>事賓上是等於一切從頭做起，條補馬</p>
<p>路上的洞穴，濟掃垃圾，開始重建地</p>
<p>下水道，而人口的激增，使本市的居</p>
<p>住及交通間題　形嚴重，在租界時代</p>
<p>，當然從未準備須供給近五百萬居民</p>
<p>的需要，無諭街道房屋及公用事業的</p>
<p>劃計，都沒有態到要滿足近五百萬居</p>
<p>民的要求，因此今天一切擴充及重建</p>
<p>的工作，在短時期內，都難做到理想</p>
<p>的滿意，這是顯而易見的事情。敵偽</p>
<p>以八年的時間，來直接間接的摧毀上</p>
<p>海，我們復興工作所需的時間，也許</p>
<p>至少亦要這樣畏，在過去兩年之內，</p>
<p>我們抱定決心，以有限的經費去做，</p>
<p>在吳市長賢能的主持下，已經有一個</p>
<p>良好的開始，我們很盼望友邦人士，</p>
<p>能了解我們問題的困雖與複雜，進而</p>
<p>協助我們完成上海現代化與復興工作</p>
<p>的艱巨任務。</p>
<p>我相信由於諸位先生與貴國人民正</p>
<p>以不屈不撓之勇氣與決心，應付本國</p>
<p>之危機，一定能了解中國及上海之困</p>
<p>難問題。因為中國單獨抗戰四年，其</p>
<p>他國家方有整軍和準備的時問，吾國</p>
<p>軍民死亡，城市炸毀，田園荒蕪，使</p>
<p>其他國家得以從容準備。諸位先生在</p>
<p>華旅行各地，當已目孿八年破壞的悲</p>
<p>慘結果，各地鐵鉼被破壞，重新修建</p>
<p>需要好幾年的時間，人民都有疲備愁</p>
<p>苦之色，凡此種種，都是迎受戰爭慘</p>
<p>重打擊的結果。但常時我們英勇的忍</p>
<p>受創痛，毫無怨言，因為深信大戰結</p>
<p>東之後，盟國巾較為幸連未受戰學直</p>
<p>接破壞者，自將飲水思源，協助我們</p>
<p>復興。對於這一點，我們迄今尚深信</p>
<p>不疑，要求外援來恢復中國戰前的經</p>
<p>濟穩定，我們決不認為這是羞恥，因</p>
<p>為我們值得友邦協助，中國和中國人</p>
<p>民在八年苦戰之中，已以生命，殘破</p>
<p>的家園，廣大的災區，預付了代價，</p>
<p>假使易地以處，中國必已對職時受害</p>
<p>的盟國作種稱援助，絕不留難，亦絕</p>
<p>不打商業算盤，在我們孔子傳統思想</p>
<p>之下，我們認為遭是一種責任，一種</p>
<p>交往之道。</p>
<p>因為諸位先生是中國的友人，你們</p>
<p>當然為中國目前的內亂及政治不安而</p>
<p>感慨，但是因為話位先生是有經騐與</p>
<p>明悉國際局勢的政治家，無疑的知道</p>
<p>我國的政治問題，並不是一個純粹的</p>
<p>內部問題。</p>
<p>我不願故作幫惶的告訴諸位，在中</p>
<p>國，諾位正目睹一個更大鬥爭的開場</p>
<p>，可是敝國不少人士都相信，像「七</p>
<p>七」事變時的情形一樣，我國又將站</p>
<p>在一個大鬥爭的第一綫，而在此鬥爭</p>
<p>中，所有的人民勢必都受到成脅。在</p>
<p>上個星期中，柏爾格萊特共產國際情</p>
<p>報局的組織，吸引了全世界人士的注</p>
<p>意，可是對於中國人民，這並不算是</p>
<p>新聞，遠在這個組織之前，在中國已</p>
<p>經有一個類似的機構，在中共指導之</p>
<p>下，包括亞洲所有的共產黨組織在內</p>
<p>，如果歡洲的共產國際是一種威脅和</p>
<p>挑戰，那中國已是久被威脅了。諸位</p>
<p>先生都知道，中國人民是一個和平的</p>
<p>民族，我們願意在和平中生活，以便</p>
<p>進行復興建設，我們在雅爾達密約以</p>
<p>後，（這個密約是我們所未會參加的</p>
<p>），曾亳無怨色地付出了密約中要我</p>
<p>們償付的代價，這就是我們和平願望</p>
<p>的最深切的表現，那時我們認為我們</p>
<p>的犧牲是為全體盟國的利益而付的代</p>
<p>價，今天我們感覺中國既因盟國間公</p>
<p>共的利益而遭受犧牲，就不應獨受此</p>
<p>事的一切惡果。</p>
<p>我方才說過，訪華團諸位先生與貴</p>
<p>國人民，因為本身正以勇氣與決心克</p>
<p>服危機，所以必能體會到我們的問題</p>
<p>和悲劇，我們兩大民族是在一個共同</p>
<p>的困難局勢之中，同時我們亦面對</p>
<p>一個共同的威脅，我深感我們的成功</p>
<p>，依靠在共同的努力上，在衷心歡迎</p>
<p>諸君的今天，允許我建議舉杯敬祝英</p>
<p>王的健康，和我們共同奮鬥的成功。</p>

<p>演詞中所稱：「決不想尋求實施閉關</p>

<p>之携手合作，實足增進愛好和平國</p>

<h3>美國務院答覆莫洛托夫　拒撤駐韓佔領軍　整個方案靜待聯大處理　維辛斯基對美國政策猛烈施抨擊</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十日電〕美國事實上業已拒絕蘇聯所提建議美蘇軍隊於一九四八年初撤出</p>
<p>朝鮮之議，聲明朝鮮獨立之整個問題，今已須待聯合國大會之決定。美國務院今日公布代理國</p>
<p>務卿洛維特答莫洛托夫外長之照會，指出美國已將建立獨立朝鮮政府之問題，置入聯大議程，</p>
<p>美政府認為撤退駐韓佔領軍，應視為該整個問題解決辦法中完整的一部。按馬歇爾國務卿於上</p>
<p>星期五致聯合國秘書長賴依之函，建議由聯合國設立委員會，於明年二月初在韓舉行選舉，隨</p>
<p>即準備撤退駐軍事。</p>
<p>〔新亞社平壞二十一日電〕美蘇混合委會蘇代表團希識科夫一行已奉政府令，本日下午一時</p>

<p>〔中央社弗魯辛廿日電〕蘇代表維辛斯基本日對美國所提諧聯合國監督朝鮮民主政府成立以</p>
<p>前之選舉，及美蘇軍隊退出整個朝鮮之建議，加以抨擊。維氏向聯大發表關於希臘問題之演說</p>
<p>時，指責美國之建議，將使朝鮮之選舉與希臘以前之選舉方式相同，渠認為此種選舉既不自由</p>
<p>，亦不民主。渠稱，美代表奧斯汀就朝鮮問題致聯大秘書長賴依之函件，表示美政府建議在朝</p>
<p>鮮舉行選舉及朝鮮國民政府成立以後撤退其軍隊，換言之，美政府決意在其武裝部隊掩護之下</p>
<p>，依照希臘之方式，舉行朝鮮之選興，預料眞正之惡例，將在選舉中發現。</p>
<h3>美表示將不惜使用武力　防止希臘受侵略　蘇反對設巴爾幹監察團</h3>
<p>〔合衆社弗營辛廿一日電〕美代表膚森今日發表廣播演說</p>
<p>，置蘇聯攻擊美國對希臘朝鮮計劃之言於不願，而警告稱，</p>
<p>美國可能以武力保護詠臘。詹森稱，「如蘇聯之巴爾幹羽黨</p>
<p>堅持侵略希臘，美國將準備與聯合國其他國家合作，實施聯</p>
<p>大會所建義之任何措施以保衛希臘。」詹森雖未明白討論使</p>
<p>用軍隊，惟另一美國發言人則稱：詹森發表此言時，意下即</p>
<p>在闡明此一點。然一般強調稱，美國如使用軍力，必先與其</p>
<p>他國家合作，而亦先須經聯大之建議，建議之通過則須有三</p>
<p>分之二之多數。</p>
<p>詹森又稱，如無法設立一監察</p>
<p>委員會，結果希臘將受更多之侵</p>
<p>略，而其他國家亦將遭過新侵略</p>
<p>。在詹森演說前，蘇外次維辛斯</p>
<p>基在聯大率直拒絕設立巴爾幹「</p>
<p>監察」委員會之建議。</p>

<p>巴爾幹監察委員會之成立，今日</p>
<p>促聯大拒絕聯大政委會之討論結</p>
<p>果，指出尚無充分證據，足證甫</p>
<p>保阿三國有協助詠臘反政府軍隊</p>
<p>之行為。聯合國巴爾幹監察委會</p>
<p>之設，有悖聯合國憲章及巴爾幹</p>
<p>國家之主權。恢復巴爾幹和平之</p>
<p>唯一方法，在強迫英軍及美軍事</p>
<p>團立即撇出希臘，並設立特委會</p>
<p>以監督美國之援希。波蘭代表蘭</p>
<p>琪嗣乃提出下一決議案，內稱，</p>
<p>「全體大會於審查成脅希臘政治</p>
<p>獨立及土地完整之問題，及各代</p>
<p>表團表示之意見後，建議各外國</p>
<p>軍隊立即日詠臘撤退，各外國軍</p>
<p>事國教練及軍事專家立即自布臘</p>
<p>召回。全體大會並請各係政府</p>
<p>至遲於一九四八年一月一日向聯</p>
<p>合國秘書長報告執行此項建議之</p>
<p>經過。」美代表詹森聲稱，若必</p>
<p>須召開特別大會以審查對於希臘</p>
<p>政治獨立領土完整之威脅，則美</p>
<p>政府準備與聯合國其他會員國合</p>
<p>作，以執行聯大為保擭希臘所建</p>
<p>議之任何措施。美國對希臘之政</p>
<p>策，目的亦僅在此，並無其他勵</p>
<p>機，亦不求物質上之報酬。當前</p>
<p>特定問題，為覓取防止侵略之方</p>
<p>法，引等問題以共同力量謀取解決，最為相宜，對於聯合國機構</p>
<p>為一種挑戰，亦為一種機會，美</p>
<p>政府決會同他國政府應付此一挑</p>
<p>職，並改進此一機會。</p>

<h3>絲織廠大部怠工　評斷會嚴飭復常　解決糾紛辦法應各遵守</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市滬東，滬西，四三兩區絲織廠四百餘家，昨日起大部陷入怠工狀態。各廠負責人</p>
<p>約二百餘人於下午三時半許給隊赴社會局請願，推代表藥昕濤，錢序葆，劉慶一等三人進揭吳局長</p>
<p>。因昨日適為勞資評斷委員會第十四次常會會期，市商會秘書長嚴諤聲在社局代表徐廣寄出席會議</p>
<p>，乃由嚴問請願莘業解釋。各廠廠主情緒則甚為激昂。按本年五月間絲織業因營業不景氣，不勝高</p>
<p>工資負担，呈請减低工資，經評斷會第十三次會議裁決核减，勞方因此發生怠工慢工等糾紛，迭經</p>
<p>社會局調解無效。嗣後本市發生電力工潮與電車工潮，評斷會為安定生產，應付緊急情勢起見，另</p>
<p>擬解決辦法八項，訓令雙方。故資方認為工潮緊念情勢已不存在，而絲織業之營業困難如舊，對評</p>
<p>斷會第二次訓令之八項辦法，無力實行，要求補救。常經鈸諤聲允將此意見在評斷會巾提出討諭，</p>
<p>各廠代表始退，靜聽會議結果。</p>
<h3>評斷委員會舉行十四次會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市勞資評斷委員會昨</p>
<p>舉行第十四次會議，主任委員吳開先</p>
<p>任主席，討論要案如下：　絲織業工</p>
<p>資斜紛前經本會裁決，後勞資雙方發生爭端，本會為應付情勢，經酌定解決辦法八項，訓令飭遵，</p>
<p>提請追認案。決議：甲，勞資雙方對評斷辦法不得申請不服，為勞資評斷所明定此次該業勞資雙方</p>
<p>對本會第十三次會議評斷辦法竟表示異議，殊屬不合。既經本會主任委員為顧念雙方情緒，予以緊</p>
<p>急措置，本會自應予以追認，惟此項辦法暫准施行四個月，至昨日發生怠工各廠，應嚴飭勞方即日</p>
<p>恢復生產。乙，如有一部份工廠對上項辦法，尙不勝負担者，雙方方方得自行另訂辦法。</p>
<p>皮鞋業資方要求减低工資案</p>
<p>，討論結果，以該業情况已趨好</p>
<p>轉，暫毋寗龐。</p>
<p>工廠解雇無定期契約勞工，</p>
<p>發遺散費辦法案，決議：甲，工</p>
<p>廠營業虧損或確無力維持經主管</p>
<p>官署調查確實者，遺散費得由本</p>
<p>會酌予减少。乙，有季節時令性</p>
<p>工廠，不能全年開工者，其停工</p>
<p>不能視作解雇。丙，違反曾經呈</p>
<p>請主管官署核准之廠規，確有證</p>
<p>據者，准予開革，不給遺散費。</p>
<h3>兩公用事業公司　工人假期評定</h3>
<p>上海電軍公司</p>
<p>及法商水電公司假</p>
<p>期爭執案，決議：</p>
<p>甲，例假十五天。</p>
<p>乙，年假除公司已</p>
<p>有勞資雙方同意之</p>
<p>辦法，且付諸實行</p>
<p>，不便變更者仍從</p>
<p>其原辦法外其未獲</p>
<p>協議而生爭執者，得參照本市一</p>
<p>般公用事業公司之規定。（服務</p>
<p>滿一至五年七天，五至十年十天</p>
<p>，十年以上十四天）協議之。丙</p>
<p>，婚假應在年假內扣除之。丁，</p>
<p>喪假照本會規定辦理。</p>
<h3>工會召開大會　仍給工資問題</h3>
<p>工</p>
<p>會召開</p>
<p>會員大</p>
<p>會，資方仍應照給工資案。決議</p>
<p>：甲，凡工廠公司行號之依工廠</p>
<p>法或有經協議規定之假日者，工</p>
<p>會召開會員或代表大會應於例假</p>
<p>日舉行。乙，凡無定期休假之工</p>
<p>廠公司行號工會召開會員或代表</p>
<p>大會時，應准予請假并照給工資</p>
<p>，惟是項會期應以工會章程所規</p>
<p>定，并經主管官署核准者為限。</p>
<p>如當選為市工會，市總工會，全</p>
<p>國總工會，或該業全國聯合會代</p>
<p>表大會代表時，其似期照實際情</p>
<p>形由資方核給之。丙，有定期休</p>
<p>似之工廠公司行號而於一般似日</p>
<p>照常工作幷另加加工工資者，工</p>
<p>曼召開會員或代表大會時應准諸</p>
<p>假，但不給加工工資。丁，工會</p>
<p>會員人數在三百人以下者，得舉</p>
<p>前呈准主管官著召開會員大會。</p>
<p>在三百人以上者應一律舉行代表</p>
<p>大會，以免影響生產。戊，工會</p>
<p>舉行代表大會，應將出席代表名</p>
<p>單於三日前抄送資方。己，凡因</p>
<p>加工會會員一大會之會員或代表</p>
<p>大會之代表，既方既給假期，倘</p>
<p>於開會時無故缺席者，工會應將</p>
<p>名單抄送資方扣除工資。</p>
<h3>自來水要求漲價　公用局暫不考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電力·電話·</p>
<p>煤氣·電車·公共汽車·輪波·</p>
<p>小火車等公用事業價格，已自昨</p>
<p>日起調整。僅自來水一項，因於</p>
<p>九月間已調整一次，故此次暫維</p>
<p>原價。現各自來水公司因於九月</p>
<p>間調整時曾與公用局議定，如物</p>
<p>價上漲百分之十，仍須准予加價</p>
<p>。至今物價上漲早過百分之十以</p>
<p>上，各公司已告虧蝕，故要求公</p>
<p>用局再度准予調整為每立方公尺</p>
<p>四千餘元。（現英商·法商二公</p>
<p>司每立方公尺價為二千五百元。</p>
<p>閘北·內地·浦東三公司每立方</p>

<h3>筵席節約苦叫館菜　中西酒樓營業銳减　私設廚房應運而生</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕筵席節約自廿日實施以來，中西</p>
<p>菜業多能各自遵守。小菜館受節約影饗較小，</p>
<p>惟較大之中西飯館營業說减，莫不呌苦。如豐</p>
<p>澤樓之營業幾减大半，因此，若干飯店以收入</p>
<p>减少，感覺將來營業頗有困難。據酒菜業同業</p>
<p>公會常務理事周敦祥稱。酒榮同業均極贊成並</p>
<p>願邀守節約之原則；但因筵席節約之實施，各</p>
<p>酒菜館營業多銳减，實無可諱言</p>
<p>。因店方之營業减少，各侍者茶</p>
<p>役之收入自亦减低。比次較大之</p>
<p>酒菜館頗受影響，幾感不能維持</p>
<p>。同時各菜館因受價格限制，並</p>
<p>禁售珍貴海味之故，若干私設廚</p>
<p>房遂應運而生，仍出售各種貴重</p>
<p>菜肴，且價格大增，如魚翅一味</p>
<p>在菜館中本售六萬元，今竟達十</p>
<p>二萬元之譜。再現規定六菜一湯</p>
<p>最高售一百甘萬元，寶則原來一</p>
<p>百廿萬元之菜，決不止六菜一湯</p>
<p>，因之，若千原定有筵席者多托</p>
<p>辭退去。現因節約條規之實行，</p>
<p>不少海味廚司已不必要，不免有</p>
<p>失業之處，且富戶扔可購買珍貴</p>
<p>海味自行烹調，決不會因荣館之</p>
<p>不川售而從事節約，如此適足造</p>
<p>成海味價格之高漲，酒荣業認為</p>
<p>際此非常時期，常然應該節約，</p>
<p>但希望規定略有彈性，使酒荣業</p>
<p>能維持營業。</p>

<h3>招待記者說明兩點</h3>
<p>「又訊」酒菜業以</p>
<p>筵席限價</p>
<p>辦法公布後，外界因最高額超過</p>
<p>一般市價，認為高抬物僅，頗多</p>
<p>誤會，特於昨日招待新聞界，設</p>
<p>明兩點：　限價限上而不限下，</p>
<p>例如筵席規定最高一百二十萬，</p>
<p>最低六十萬；然中小館商願廉售</p>
<p>三四十一萬元，或經濟客飯願售至</p>
<p>一萬元以內者，仍聽其自由。</p>
<p>節約筵席品目雖减，但數量仍保</p>
<p>持一定標準，足饜一席十人之食</p>
<p>慾。</p>
<h3>孫蔣兩夫人　連袂觀書展</h3>

<h3>取贖被圈購土地　黃金價伸算創舉　清理處對陶德榮案函復參會</h3>

<p>，在淪陷期間被敵偽強迫圈購，懇請即速發還，以恤民艱等語，</p>
<p>即經轉函中央信託局查復。茲獲中信局敵偽產業清理處復稱：本</p>
<p>案業經會同上海市地政局組織之處理敵偽征用圈用土地小組委員</p>
<p>會第十次會議決定，准將原自敵偽收受價金，照黃金市價伸算，</p>
<p>飭由該申請人繳款領回，一俟核價手續辦竣，當即通知陶德榮洽</p>
<p>辦云云。是珊以黃金市價伸算取贖敵偽強買士地，尚屬創見。</p>

<p>瞿鉞等，以本市公用</p>
<p>局於本月十四日起停</p>
<p>止汽車過戶，認為與</p>
<p>民不利，特致函潘議</p>
<p>長及徐副議長，申述</p>
<p>應予取消此種辦法之</p>
<p>理由略稱：「中央限</p>
<p>制私人使用汽車之主</p>
<p>要目的，一為嚴格規</p>

<p>工作，原辦法中並無</p>
<p>停止汽車過戶之明文規定，因汽車過戶，為車主</p>
<p>之轉移，非車輛之增加，與限制辦法並無抵觸，</p>
<p>而與節約原旨更絕無絲毫影響。且舊汽車為市民</p>
<p>動產之一，政府應予以合理保障。據市府施政報</p>
<p>告，截至本年三月份止，向公用局登記之機動車</p>
<p>，為二萬二千六百二十五輛，姑以每輛平均價格</p>
<p>一億元計算，如果汽車實行停止過戶，即無形中</p>
<p>市民資金被凍結在二萬億以上，試思市民之損失</p>
<p>為何如。要知節約之要旨，在裕民，並非病民，</p>
<p>公用局之設立，在利民，並非害民。此種單行法</p>
<p>規，未繩參會審議市府公布以前，何得擅自實施</p>
<p>。相應備函舉達，敬請鈞裁，懇即咨請市政府，</p>
<p>即日令飭公用局，迅予取消停止汽軍過戶辦法，</p>
<p>以利市民。」</p>
<h3>趙局長談汽車節約　第一步爲防止設計費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市汽車節約，現正由公用局邀集</p>
<p>有關各機關審愼研訂賓施細則中，於月內擬就提</p>
<p>交市政會議通過，自下月起實行。據公用局長趙</p>
<p>會珏於昨日告記者：該一實施辦法之原則，第一</p>
<p>步為防止浪費，凡擁有一輛以上者，先予减少。</p>
<p>並為防止其會以多稱名義登記，公用局正自登記</p>
<p>表方而查考，如有數輛汽車同屬於一主人者，仍</p>
<p>將予以核减。第二步為取締非必需之車輛，以抽</p>
<p>籤等方式分批淘汰。該一實施辦法需按步實施，</p>
<p>否則將發生擁有數輛者未被取締，而祗有一輛者</p>
<p>通被抽中淘汰之不公平情形，故目前暫不先實行</p>
<p>抽籤淘汰制。至有使用汽車資格者之標準，除機</p>
<p>關，銀行，工廠及與民生有關之事業等外，中央</p>
<p>祇規定醫師一項。但上海情形特殊，如律師，技</p>
<p>師，會計師等在工作上亦有需要使用汽車者，故</p>
<p>在擬訂中之實施細則對中央所定之標準將加補充</p>
<p>。總之，本市汽车衆多，欲實行節約，甚為麻煩</p>
<p>，為恐多漏洞，故在研訂實施細則時，不壓求詳</p>
<p>，以謀完善。</p>

<p>與工廠，最後方可配予未嘗內遷</p>
<p>之工廠。　核配後之經營辦法，</p>

<h3>中國文化源出洮河　地質學家裴文中　獲學術上收穫　明年將籌措大批經費赴甘繼從事發掘工作</h3>
<p>〔本報關州十八日航訊〕名地質學家裴文中，本年七</p>
<p>月初，由平張陝來關，即往渭河，洮河，大夏河流域，</p>
<p>從事考古工作，先後歴時三月餘，已於臼前返關。裴氏</p>
<p>此次來甘肅工作，因限於經費，僅偕中央地質調查所西</p>
<p>北分所技正米泰恒，帶少數工人至野外工作。年前以發</p>
<p>現「武都原人」噪名國內的科學教育館研究員王永焱，</p>
<p>也參加了渭河流域的工作。八月間，王氏耑赴武都繼續</p>
<p>採掘骨化石，也收集到三千餘件，日前回到蘭州。裴氏</p>
<p>本擬去武都考察，後因鑒於洮河流城工作重要，乃改變</p>
<p>原來計劃，不去武都。裴氏此次收集到的資料，共有十</p>
<p>二箱，大都是陶片，石器等有關</p>
<p>古代人類文化的珍貴資料，由此</p>
<p>可以尋繹到黃河上游古人類的活</p>
<p>動悄態。</p>
<p>安德生　劃分六期</p>
<p>據裴氏</p>
<p>對記者稱</p>
<p>：瑞典人</p>
<p>安德生，</p>
<p>（J.G.Anderson）,從前來</p>
<p>甘·靑一帶考古，曾就渠發掘獲</p>
<p>得的彩陶，劃我國文化為「齊家</p>
<p>」（此期約在西歷紀元前兩千餘</p>
<p>年），「仰韶」，（此期亦名豐</p>
<p>山期，乃新石器時代末期，和銅</p>
<p>器時代　接），「馬廠」，「辛店」，「寺窑」，「沙井」，（此期</p>
<p>約在紀元前五百年，當我國漢代</p>
<p>）等六個時期，安氏此項論文發</p>
<p>表後，學術界對其「齊家」期，</p>
<p>均抱懷疑態度。裴氏此次耑往臨</p>
<p>洮齊家坪地方考察，曾發現古代</p>
<p>人類住屋，便證明安氏的學說，</p>
<p>確有依據。</p>
<p>漢以前　有石灰壁</p>
<p>不過據</p>
<p>裴氏表示</p>
<p>：「齊家</p>
<p>」期似不</p>
<p>能算最早，因就崖內之用具如「</p>
<p>鬲」，（三足陶器）及婦人骷髏</p>
<p>項上所佩之琉璃珠等看來，決非</p>
<p>史前人類，唯在漢代以前，則亳</p>
<p>无疑義。</p>
<p>裴氏繼稱：我們考察曆史紀載</p>
<p>，漢代以前人類尚無住屋內者，</p>
<p>且此屋內已有石灰牆壁，此點亦</p>
<p>為前人未經發現者。由此可加強</p>
<p>我們對古代文化研免的認識。</p>
<p>學術界　重要發現</p>
<p>關於我</p>
<p>國文化的</p>
<p>發源，以</p>
<p>往學術界</p>
<p>只假設是由洮河發源，沿渭河流</p>
<p>域，經過關巾（陝西），才與黃河</p>
<p>流域啣接，以達河南平原。這不</p>
<p>過是懸揣，尚無考古學家在渭河</p>
<p>流域實地考察過。裴氏此次在渭</p>
<p>河流域發現了很多彩陶，而且散</p>
<p>布的區域甚廣，已證實洮河和黃</p>
<p>河流域的文化，確與渭河流域啣</p>
<p>接，這是裴氏最重要的發現，也</p>
<p>是最有學術價值的收穫。</p>
<p>籌經費　大量發掘</p>
<p>裴氏昨</p>
<p>晚應蘭州</p>
<p>大學校長</p>
<p>辛樹幟氏</p>
<p>之邀，在該校大禮堂講了上而的</p>
<p>幾段話。今天（十八日）又應中</p>
<p>國地質學會蘭州分會會員之請，</p>
<p>講解地質問題。據裴氏表示：此</p>
<p>次不過是工作的開始，日內即攬</p>
<p>所得資料十二箱，返回北平，整</p>
<p>理研究這些資料，明年將籌措大</p>
<p>批經費，邀約我國有名的考古學</p>
<p>家和地質學家，一同再來甘肅，</p>
<p>繼議大量發掘的工作。（通訊員</p>

<p>結果，客軍以三比二小勝震</p>
<p>東會。裁判梁扶初顯得剛，</p>
<p>宣司令以球擲出後，客軍首</p>
<p>先進攻，震東之投手俞長</p>
<p>，壓施突擊，第一局客軍先</p>
<p>得一分，雙方攻守嚴寗，至</p>
<p>第六局，各二未分勝負，最</p>
<p>後一局，震東會陣容崧懈，</p>

<h3>香島球報　傑志領袖羣雄連勝中華南華　星島五虎返返港參加助陳</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕球賽年年有，今年特別多，一連幾</p>
<p>日，看得膩了。十一日星期六，甲組傑志逢南華，形勢一面倒，</p>
<p>傑志異軍突起，南華今非昔比，傑志以五比一大勝。師老無能的</p>
<p>南華，遇新興的傑志，敗是意巾事。所屬好手如陳德輝，梁榮照</p>
<p>，劉榮光雖全登戰陣，但鬥將朱榮光太幼稚，累了南華如斯慘敗</p>
<p>，前半時已負三比一，下半場再輸兩球，五比一終局。</p>
<p>華隊天下　今年聯賽十五隊參</p>
<p>戰，除了星島尚未露</p>
<p>過面之外，只得傑志</p>
<p>和中華為長勝軍，這兩枝長勝軍</p>
<p>將在週四（十六日）碰頭。星島</p>
<p>第二批球員在十六臼左右抵港，</p>
<p>今年洋兵全不濟事，球國將全是</p>
<p>漢家天下。聯竇現勢如下：（十</p>
<p>月十二日止）</p>
<p>再勝中華　十六日星期四，最</p>
<p>精采的一戰上演，華</p>
<p>隊兩枝長勝軍碰頭，</p>
<p>傑志拼緊用中華，傑志得星島五將</p>
<p>投效，吸引力更大，五時未到，</p>
<p>海軍場上已擠滿了人。遲來的，</p>
<p>望門興嘆。時屆，但見廿二條戰</p>
<p>將分列兩邊：</p>
<p>傑志會</p>
<p>朱兆恒</p>
<p>鄭英　　侯榕生</p>
<p>振　　宋靈聖　劉慶材</p>
<p>黃景總　黎兆榮　郭英祺　李殿祺　何應芬</p>
<p>中華會</p>
<p>余啓恩</p>
<p>李國威　何家强</p>
<p>陳錦肇　孔慶煜　何有基</p>
<p>梁炳坤　李春發　繆暢榮　郭灼昌　李大輝</p>
<p>大戰結果，傑志以最優形勢，</p>
<p>五比一壓倒中華，這完全是技術</p>
<p>的分野，中華的敗除了技遜一籌</p>
<p>之外，戰略錯誤，動作過火，都</p>
<p>是造成慘敗的原因。</p>
<p>中華在全戰中，把銳力放在前</p>
<p>半時去撲擊，所以前半時雖能爭</p>
<p>得二比一，下半塲却輸三球，力</p>
<p>不如人，非戰之罪。</p>
<p>反觀傑志，全以經驗和技術去</p>
<p>壓服對手的盲動，所以勝來並不</p>
<p>吃力，兩隊的後衛都好，中華的</p>
<p>前鋒却太散了。</p>
<p>遊英五將，兆恒和榕生未見大</p>
<p>進步，園芬，兆榮，靈聖較有良</p>
<p>好表演，球到即傳，見機便射，</p>
<p>是他们的新功夫。</p>
<p>进球程序：前半时，兆榮光綱</p>
<p>身手，中華率春發扳成一比一，</p>
<p>英祺射甲，二比一，傑志佔先，</p>
<p>下半塲三球英祺一，兆榮二，中</p>
<p>華無所獲，志傑暫保長勝令　。</p>

<h3>銀根愈逼愈緊　華股繼續下跌</h3>
<p>華股昨仍受銀根逼迫，</p>
<p>行莊頗多以實貨塞出，以</p>
<p>致供過於求。同時業中並</p>
<p>傳不穩氣氛，中途十分怯</p>
<p>疲，除若干成交不甚普遍者外，</p>
<p>泰半慘跌甚多。午後銀根較鬆，</p>

<h3>散戶浮多拋售　棉紗布均疲軟　現棉人心不振交易濟清稀</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，客帮雖逢低稍</p>
<p>有吸胃，一般散戶浮多，均貶價</p>

<p>昨日棉布市况，初開平庸，旋</p>
<p>以人心虛怯，各方吐多納少，市</p>

<p>其他各布大都盤低。</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易淸稀，同業因銀</p>

<p>盤在七千萬兀左右，旋即降至六</p>
<p>千六七百萬元，略有成交，午收</p>
<p>更短至四百萬元。下午因同業中</p>
<p>顯寸已軋好，故喊價又告抬高，</p>
<p>由六百萬元而至九百萬元，終比</p>

<h3>新聞殺人</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>誰也不能否認，報紙有促使社會向上的使命</p>
<p>，基於這一層理由，報紙的揭戲新開實有審慎的</p>
<p>必要，通訊社之發佈新聞，亦應願及發佈後的彩</p>
<p>響。</p>
<p>最近漢口曾發生了一件新聞殺人的新聞，據</p>
<p>申報漢口八日的電訊：此問亞新社以發佈嬬婦張</p>
<p>安華失節新聞，致張女投江自殺</p>
<p>身死。</p>
<p>本來嗎，嫗婦失節是一件私</p>
<p>事，而且即是失節甚至再嫁，事</p>
<p>實上也算不了什麼。（並非我為</p>
<p>死者辦護事實如此）。這種個人</p>
<p>際事，實在不應該讓它佔去報紙</p>
<p>寶貴的篇幅。新聞記者自身的人</p>
<p>格與職責更應絕對願及，決不應</p>
<p>老在私人私事間兜圈子，把揭發</p>
<p>一些私人隱秘為能事，把這一點</p>
<p>點「噱頭」來作為吸引讀者的方法</p>
<p>。新聞記者曾與律師，醫生被人</p>
<p>目為三大壞蛋（？）這決不是新</p>
<p>聞記者本身的榮譽，究其賓，新聞記者的一支筆</p>
<p>確有被人目為坏東西的可能；惟有通過高尚的人</p>
<p>格，充分的正義感，新聞記者對社會才是有用而</p>
<p>有功的人，才能受到社會上各階層的尊敬，他筆</p>
<p>下的新聞才是促使社會向上進步的新聞，發佈後</p>
<p>的影饗才不致是「殺人」的了。</p>
<h3>客裏話重陽</h3>
<p>— 殊响</p>
<p>獨在異鄉為異客，每逢佳節陪思親，遙知兄弟</p>
<p>登高日，遍插茱萸少一人。</p>
<p>作客他鄉，又逢到重陽佳節，念起王輞川的名</p>
<p>句，怎不心傷！</p>
<p>四時佳節，最使人憶親思家的，莫如黨陽與除</p>
<p>夕兩個節日了。重陽的宴會，未知始於何時，不過</p>
<p>從費長房呌桓景於九月九日令家人縫　盛茱萸繫臂</p>
<p>上，登山飲菊花酒消災起，這個佳即，在漢代即已</p>
<p>創始。以保守國粹講，北方人比南方人强，北方人</p>
<p>沒有這到戰禍的對重九登高的節日雅興，還舉行不</p>
<p>衰，南方人不過吃幾塊茶食店裏製成的重陽糕，登</p>
<p>高大都自然廢止了。</p>
<p>北方人在重陽日，除戲酒具，茶爐，食榼登高</p>
<p>遊宴外，一而還用麵餅嵌棗票做华糕，嫁女的父母</p>
<p>，還必於前一日迎歸歡叙。重陽節在北方，又名見</p>
<p>女節，小孩子放紙鳶為戲，南方人對重陽，顯然比</p>
<p>較冷淡。</p>
<p>「重陽無雨一冬晴」，这句</p>
<p>農家口頭禪，相當戲騐，許多人說重陽日晴，冬至，元旦，上元</p>
<p>，清明四明些晴，雨景則皆雨，這話恐怕未必準確。</p>
<p>重陽詩中，我最愛岑參的：「强欲登高去，無人送酒來，遙僯故圍菊，應傍戰塲開。」</p>
<p>這首詩最切合現在許多人的環境，今日能有幾個人會送酒給高臥的陶彭澤，戰火漫天，故園中的菊花，恐怕已都傍　戰塲開了。</p>
<p>朱放的：「欲從携手登高去</p>
<p>，一到門前意已無，那得更將頭</p>
<p>上髮，學他年少插茱萸。」這首</p>
<p>詩也很切合今時人的思想，頭上</p>
<p>的黑髮轉白，還有什麼心思再去</p>
<p>挿應時的茱萸呢？</p>
<p>乘馬射箭，是古時八必習的</p>
<p>，唐代宋國公蕭璃，九月九日賜</p>
<p>射，瑀发箭俱不著　，歐陽詢嘲</p>
<p>之日：「念風吹緩箭，弱手馭强</p>
<p>弓，欲高翻復下，應西還更東，</p>
<p>十迴供著地，兩手併擎空，借閒</p>
<p>誰為此，乃應是宋公。」唐代的</p>
<p>強盛，是風俗尚武武的好處，到了</p>
<p>宋代，像蕭瑀的文人，恐怕不足</p>
<p>為奇。</p>
<p>唐人咏重陽詩甚多，惟都不</p>
<p>及糕字，劉禹錫作重陽詩擬用糕</p>
<p>字，結果思六經中無此字遂止，</p>
<p>到宋子京便大胆作起：「颼館輕</p>
<p>箱拂曙袍，糗養花飲鬥分曹，劉</p>
<p>郎不耿題糕字，空負詩中一世豪</p>
<p>。」唐人詩注重煆煉，宋詩重豪</p>
<p>放，劉禹錫的不題糕字，亦是他</p>
<p>的持重地方，不算為弱的。</p>
<p>趙長卿的重九道上南歌子詞</p>
<p>云：「此日知何日，他鄉憶故鄕</p>
<p>，亂山深處過重陽，走馬吹花，</p>
<p>無復少年狂」；「黃菊擎枝重，</p>
<p>紅萊濕露香，扁舟隨雁過瀟湘，</p>
<p>遙想萊庭，應恨不同觴」。</p>
<p>去年此日，從貴陽東下，亂</p>
<p>山深處，祇在道旁村舍中，一引</p>
<p>濁醪，回想少年時的登高飲酒豪</p>
<p>興，不禁憮然！</p>
<h3>小重山</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>重九</p>
<p>又見黃花隹節芳，年年</p>
<p>存妄想，避災殃！吃人米</p>
<p>價嚇人糖，糕味幾人嚐？</p>
<p>滿地走流亡，茱萸發落</p>
<p>伍，不靈光！未來科學戰</p>
<p>爭狂，逃何處？鬼哭費長</p>
<p>房！</p>
<h3>南京城－－究竟有多大？</h3>
<p>— 林梅</p>
<p>每一個中華民國的國民，似</p>
<p>乎對於自己的首都，都應該有一</p>
<p>個澈底的明際。我們根據了道一</p>
<p>個原則，且來向你測騐一下，南</p>
<p>京城究竟有多少大小？</p>
<p>這一個問題我現在提出來了</p>
<p>，我可以開保險公司來担保，一</p>
<p>百個中華民國的國民，有九十九</p>
<p>個是不知道的。這九十九個不知</p>
<p>道的國民，為了要明白這一個問</p>
<p>題的解答，於是不得不去翻一下</p>
<p>地岡了。現在，我也是這九十九</p>
<p>個國民中的一分子，我且把我翻</p>
<p>得地圖的結果紀錄如下：</p>
<p>振並與地社出版的「中國</p>
<p>新地圖」，是時仲華編的，三十</p>
<p>五年十月改訂三版，上面說南京</p>
<p>城的周圍是三十四公里。</p>
<p>新民地學社出版的「新民</p>
<p>中國地圖」，是徐退之編的，三</p>
<p>十五年九月發行，上面說南京城</p>
<p>的周圍是四十七公里。</p>
<p>中國史地圖表編篡社出版</p>
<p>的「中學適用中國地理教科圖」</p>
<p>，是三十五年十二月出版的，</p>
<p>上面說南京城的周圍是五十五公</p>
<p>里。</p>
<p>我沒有多量的錢，再去買其</p>
<p>他的地圖來翻一下，究竟這三本</p>
<p>地長，我們應該根據那一本才對</p>
<p>？我們試想一下，一個人的步行</p>
<p>，一天能走多少路？如果依這三</p>
<p>本地圖而論，最小的比了最大的</p>
<p>要相差二十一公里，這二十一公</p>
<p>里，就等於最小的和最大的比較</p>
<p>是相差有二分之一弱一些。請問</p>
<p>這三分之一弱一些，一個老百姓</p>
<p>步行要多少時候？</p>
<p>假定我是一個學生，依照教</p>
<p>育部規定的會攷規則，我不能加</p>
<p>以反對，我祗好去會攷了。教師</p>
<p>出了這樣像我所提出的題目，我</p>
<p>不知教師根據那一本地圖為標準</p>
<p>，即使我答了多少公里或者是多</p>
<p>少公里的兩個答案，我能不能及</p>
<p>格，還是等於我買了許多張發財</p>
<p>票之能不能得頭獎一樣的渺茫。</p>
<h3>說登高</h3>
<p>— 丁榮觀</p>
<p>費長房為了避難，聽從壺公的勸告，在九月九日的一天</p>
<p>，挈同家人，關家上山，結果浩刦獲免，遂開後世重陽發高</p>
<p>的風俗。</p>
<p>無獨有偶，這在基督教的聖經裏，也可找得類此的記載</p>
<p>。其一是耶穌預言末世的日子，他指示說：「那時，在猶太</p>
<p>的應該逃郅山上。」（馬太福音廿四章）。其次是舊約記載</p>
<p>天使援救羅得一家，也叮囑：「逃命吧！不可回頭看，也不</p>
<p>可在平原站住，要往山上逃跑，免得你被剿滅」（創世記十</p>
<p>九章）。逃難而擇山上，這在二十世紀近代的科學戰爭中也</p>
<p>頗具事實上的根據：此蓋丘陵地帶，形勢既高，其受毒氣，</p>
<p>疫病，砲火及炸彈的波害，也自較平地為輕，居高臨下，在</p>
<p>觀察上尤較平原更占優勢。我人更可想像未來在破壞力特強</p>
<p>的火箭砲，及原子戰爭的時候，防空壕既完全失其保障，則</p>
<p>惟一可靠的地點，也只有高山比較可以倖免。近來蘇聯對工</p>
<p>业中心的分佈，就選擇在後方毗亞洲的烏拉山地帶，其用意</p>
<p>是不難明白的。</p>
<p>不甯如是，即在平時，就是不為選難，爬山運動也可收</p>
<p>盛大的效果。昔孔子登泰山而小天下。登高就可以增進我人</p>
<p>的視野。語云：「行還自邇，登高自卑。」詩云：「欲窮千</p>
<p>里目，更上一層樓。」作為一個人，不能不有見識，登高既</p>
<p>拓展我們的胸襟，又有助我們的健康，值茲秋高氣爽，正是</p>
<p>郊遊的機會，屆時一家人高山聚餐，縱不必為避難，也不失</p>
<p>其行樂，我想古人創節立俗，其用意也在此吧？</p>
<h3>鷄蛋在英國的故事</h3>
<p>— 中立</p>
<p>倫敦鄉下一個老爵士在他第一個孫子生下來</p>
<p>不久，在英格蘭鄉問送來了一位老朋友的賀儀，</p>
<p>——一個小木箱——上面貼着「輕放」二個字，</p>
<p>起初大家以為是古老的玻璃器具，打開一看，原</p>
<p>來是睡在棉花上的兩個雞蛋，這份大的禮物，簡</p>
<p>直驚倒了滿座的來賓，連那七十二歲的老爵士也</p>
<p>感激得老淚橫流。結果去換得了三個月的食糧，</p>
<p>麵粉和馬鈴薯等。</p>
<p>老百姓們，按照政府的「分</p>
<p>配券」上，每個月可以配購到二</p>
<p>個雞蛋的「蛋粉」鮮雞蛋是沒有</p>
<p>的。</p>
<p>在英國「三月不知蛋味」的</p>
<p>人是很多的，即使有了鲜鷄蛋的话，那就是害得主妇不知怎样利用它。</p>
<p>據說有一位畏居倫敦最近奉</p>
<p>派到意大利去的一個人，在那裘</p>
<p>發現了鮮雞蛋多得嚇人，就抱定</p>
<p>了「餓了吃蛋」的主旨，在他踏</p>
<p>上歸程的前夕，竟一口氣吃了十</p>
<p>七個雞蛋，然後拍拍肚子道：「</p>
<p>哈哈，囤積了八個多月的雞蛋在</p>
<p>肚中了。」</p>
<p>最近，英政府又把「雞蛋粉</p>
<p>」配額縮小了些，老百姓們直抱</p>
<p>怨得要死，反對得最激烈的是一</p>
<p>家電影公司，他們把一個雞蛋放</p>
<p>在匣子裏，上面放一個花園來開</p>
<p>一次追悼會而拍在影生裏，到各</p>
<p>地去放映。</p>
<p>不但是英國國本國人難得到雞</p>
<p>蛋，使是各國駐英的使節亦然如</p>
<p>是。一次，一位某國的大使，心</p>
<p>中想痛快地吃一餐荷包蛋，於是</p>
<p>寫了一件公文給英國外交部要求</p>
<p>配給五個雞蛋的蛋粉。結果，這</p>
<p>張呈文由外交部到內政部，由內</p>
<p>政部到糧食部。這樣的轉了半個</p>
<p>月的圈子，才由糧食部批准下來</p>
<p>，准許買一個鮮雞蛋，再過二星</p>
<p>期才由糧食部派了一位专差把這</p>
<p>個雞蛋送到，並要正式地開個收</p>
<p>據。那位大使拿到這個雞蛋後，</p>
<p>正是越看越愛，實在不忍把她吃</p>
<p>掉。於是拿了一個玻璃岔把他放</p>
<p>在裏面。拱在書桌上。使來賓看</p>
<p>了個個都噴嘖稱羡不已。</p>
<p>據說有一次某部隊曾發過</p>
<p>次戰爭紀念章，結果人多章少，</p>
<p>於是決定沒有發紀念章者人給一</p>
<p>蛋，而大家都搶着要蛋，於是舉</p>
<p>行抽籤，抽到蛋的人個個得意洋</p>
<p>洋，而未得的却祗大家悄悄地拿</p>
<p>了紀念章走開。</p>
<h3>榕城秋書</h3>
<p>— 壘</p>
<p>秋風落葉惹人愁，多少骚人墨客，多少深闻少老婦，與這撩人的季節，牽動悉絲，</p>
<p>拋落着</p>
<p>懷人念遠，以及含</p>
<p>情帶恨的眼淚。同</p>
<p>時，也正有多少闊</p>
<p>老紳士，感覺到秋</p>
<p>高氣爽，正是登高望遠。遊冶山川，</p>
<p>開暢胸懷的良辰。一些商人市儈</p>
<p>，正像睡醒的虫兒，意識到長</p>
<p>夏的淡季已經過去，趕緊敲響着</p>
<p>算盤，為各種寂寞塵封的商品，</p>
<p>重新裝扮着高超的身價，擠在市</p>
<p>場，顯露頭角。</p>
<p>福州，這個南中國的尾閭港</p>
<p>，她讓一具裝有彈簧的鋼床，感</p>
<p>覺非常敏說，任何一種細小的震</p>
<p>動，都會引起她的慣性作用，一</p>
<p>如一個細小的漣漪，不斷地擴展</p>
<p>她的範國，除非受阻力而全身碎</p>
<p>裂，她將無盡止地向前。雖然福</p>
<p>州的物價，很少自發而影響週遭</p>
<p>的能力，她却的確很容易接受外</p>
<p>來的影饗。在這季候輪轉的新機</p>
<p>緣裏，福州市場，已經具有無限</p>
<p>的活力，在準備蓬勃迸發了。</p>
<h3>高僧</h3>
<p>— 李仁衆</p>
<p>在舉世以刀兵相</p>
<p>仇，貪財　貨為謀的</p>
<p>今日，忽然來了高僧</p>
<p>義大利人羅根那大，</p>
<p>來滬闡揚佛教。佛教</p>
<p>是高深的哲學，所以</p>
<p>許多愚夫愚婦的信佛</p>
<p>，往往會變成牛頭不</p>
<p>對馬面的佛教，旁門</p>
<p>所及，反成迷信。</p>
<p>高僧是曾研究過</p>
<p>科學的，和尚有科學</p>
<p>根底的畢竟是鳳毛麟</p>
<p>角。這位科學和尚說</p>
<p>，要消減原子彈的恐</p>
<p>懼心理，須要舉行下</p>
<p>列戒條：　不殺生。</p>
<p>不受非分之物。</p>
<p>不汚人妻。　不說謊</p>
<p>。　不酗酒。</p>
<p>科學和尚雖然能</p>
<p>洞察時世病根，然而</p>
<p>這五條戒條舉世的人</p>
<p>是否可以個個做得到</p>
<p>？而至「放下屠刀，</p>
<p>立地成佛。」不用說</p>
<p>是終究是一個「難」</p>
<p>字！</p>
<p>羅根那大又說：</p>
<p>如果科學能配合佛敎</p>
<p>敎意，方才可使科學</p>
<p>眞正為人類謀幸福。</p>
<p>否則反而摧殘人類！</p>
<p>句句是晨鐘暮鼓的警</p>
<p>世良言，然而這個世</p>
<p>界已經是病入膏盲，</p>
<p>積重難返了！</p>
<p>不過在這叔世，</p>
<p>有這樣一個和尚現身</p>
<p>設法，畢究是不可少</p>
<p>的。</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐的娛樂</p>
<p>美國女人可以算是世界上最會尋快樂的人了。她們從來不作無為憂慮，她們的心境常是寬</p>
<p>闊的，由內心的愉怏而流露於外形，所以笑口常開，那完全是自然的，倘如一個多愁善病蛾眉</p>
<p>雙鎖的中國林黛玉在拍照時免強把牙齒露出來，扮着苦笑，那決不能增加一分美麗的，美國女</p>
<p>子娛樂的方法很多，十七歲未滿的女孩子因為受到父母的管東，行動比較不自由，但可以看電</p>
<p>影，參加一切家庭跳舞會，還有參加被單會的特權。什麼呌做被單會Blanket　Party呢？帶被</p>
<p>單一條，偕同男友到郊外去露宿一宵，道是非常古怪而不道德的交際，十分之九的女孩子會在</p>
<p>那個晚上失去童貞，十七歲以前便可公然交際了，父母再也管不了她。她可以酒排間，在總會</p>
<p>，遊戲場找對象，可以出入旅館，或另行租賃公寓房子，像初出籠的小烏，終日翱翔。她們除</p>
<p>紙醉金迷的酒排問夜總會外，也有種種正當娛樂，她們可以游泳，驕馬，打網球，在公園內一</p>
<p>定有網球場，也有出租的馬匹，市內有演冰場，男女雜杳，可以一見種情，找到合式的對象。</p>
<p>文藝性的女子，可以加入各種文藝團體如作家協會，香樂會，戲劇協會之類，那些團體每</p>
<p>星期一開會聚餐談話二次，宣讀作品，交換意見。</p>
<p>這種國體裏的女會員包括未婚的女子，充婦，風流寡婦</p>
<p>，名女伶，歌星，女作家，女記者，不乏隹麗，可供選擇。</p>
<p>聚餐費極廉，通常為攤派方式，每人美金一兩元。在美國南</p>
<p>部各省，感行賽牛，每季舉行，成為美國小姐出風頭大好機</p>
<p>會，她們全身牧童裝束，騎了野牛從木柵裹狼奔豕突而出，</p>
<p>觀衆鼓掌歡呼，如能不被野牛襯下背來，便可穩得頭彩。還</p>
<p>有大西洋城每年選舉「美國小姐」各地競選人伴問家屬前來</p>
<p>參加大選，軋鬧忙的各界婦女也從各地潮湧而來，屆時競選</p>
<p>一個個打扮得花技招展坐在花車上遊行全市，色相公開，任</p>
<p>人評斷，第一名多半被好萊塢電影公司重金禮聘，不中選的</p>
<p>女子，也可回至本地，參加時裝表演，聊以解嘲。玉照在報</p>
<p>紙登出，風頭仍健，綜括說來，她們是寓體育及藝術於娛樂</p>
<p>，比中國小姐們又麻將，推牌九，要有意義些。</p>

<h3>鬼話</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>我們在深夜的雨巷裏走着，路旁人家的燈全都滅了，什</p>
<p>麼都瞧不見，越走越走進黑暗裏……</p>
<p>遠處有野狗在在狂吠，近處，</p>
<p>樹葉子被吹打得嘩啦啦的響。</p>
<p>「你不怕嗎？」他問。</p>
<p>「怕什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「什麼都不怕麼？」</p>
<p>「不怕，我沒有金銀財竇，</p>
<p>誰來搶却？」</p>
<p>「也許有」故意悄悄的</p>
<p>設：「鬼。」</p>
<p>「唔，現在是二十世紀的科</p>
<p>學時代，」我笑起來：「而且，</p>
<p>鬼會比人更可怕麼？」</p>
<p>「來無蹤，去無跡，滴溜溜</p>
<p>一陣陰風……」</p>
<p>「那只是鬼的可愛，却不是</p>
<p>鬼的可怕。」我振振有詞。</p>
<p>「說得這樣輕巧？有一天，</p>
<p>我要是死了，我的靈魂一定來找</p>
<p>你，「他恐嚇着：」那時候——</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「歡迎，還是孩子時代，在</p>
<p>夜深人靜的孤燈下，「聊齋」，</p>
<p>「螢窗異草」，我就心嚮往之，</p>
<p>一直憧憬着鬼的世界，狐的生涯</p>
<p>，我是一個愛鬼者，因為有良知</p>
<p>的鬼，較之「官場現形記」中的</p>
<p>人不知要可愛多少。所以，假使</p>
<p>有一天，你以鬼的身份來訪，我</p>
<p>當竭誠以待，那時候，可別忘記</p>
<p>告訴我鬼國——也就是貴國的故</p>
<p>事。」</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，笑了：「眞是鬼</p>
<p>話連篇。」</p>
<p>「但是鬼話倒許比人話眞實</p>
<p>而又中肯哩。」</p>
<p>他無言，顯然是默認了我的</p>
<p>「鬼話」。朋友，如果有那樣的</p>
<p>一天，我的靈魄從另一個世界來</p>
<p>找你，你打算怎樣呢？歡迎？還</p>
<p>是拒絕？</p>
<h3>嗜好三題</h3>
<p>— 張繼樓</p>
<p>茶</p>
<p>生起紅泥的風</p>
<p>爐，新坎的松果，</p>
<p>氤氳着淸芬，粗笨</p>
<p>的茶具，飄忽着淡</p>
<p>淡的水氣。</p>
<p>你喜歡紅茶的</p>
<p>醇厚，還是綠茶的</p>
<p>淸冽？</p>
<p>莫管勞人贊美是曆史的精鍊</p>
<p>，或誹議是世俗的頒廢；「倫得</p>
<p>浮生半日問」，享受些隱逸的雅</p>
<p>趣，可勝七年塵夢。</p>
<p>如果將酒比做情婦，一度幽</p>
<p>會，祗求得片刻的陶醉，安慰；</p>
<p>而茶却是你肺腑的好友，一次把</p>
<p>晤，即可傾盡心底的塵煩，悲</p>
<p>忿。</p>
<p>品着香茗，會生起懷古的幽</p>
<p>情，參悟人世的奧秘。</p>
<p>烟</p>
<p>在沉鬱的日子裏，我需要一</p>
<p>枝烟。</p>
<p>一枝燃燒着熊熊的熱情的火</p>
<p>誤，繚繞着淡淡的柔情的霧氛的</p>
<p>姻掷。</p>
<p>當淡藍的姻雲縹緲在唇邊，</p>
<p>辛辣的滋味刺激着咽喉；我便會</p>
<p>從現寶中墜入沉思。一種雲鶴般</p>
<p>的心情，彷彿自己已羽化而在飄</p>
<p>忍的雲霧中翱翔。</p>
<p>凝視着吐自口中的淡淡的姻</p>
<p>圈，我感到無比的靜謐和安詳。</p>
<p>有了烟，我便不會成覺寂寞</p>
<p>和孤獨。</p>
<p>酒</p>
<p>在生活的壓榨下，你一定感</p>
<p>到疲勞和麻木了，找尋一點小小</p>
<p>的刺激吧！</p>
<p>玫瑰紅的葡萄酒．蘋果绿的</p>
<p>竹叶靑，更有那陳年的花　，新</p>
<p>蘸的米　；這些都會給你於興奮</p>
<p>的。</p>
<p>亮了柔和的掛燈，執着淡</p>
<p>淡的綠釀，這情景，已夠使你陶</p>
<p>醉神往了；更何待帶三分醉態，</p>
<p>凝視着映在鏡裏的酖顏。</p>
<p>為歲月變還而消殘的，靑春</p>
<p>的光輝；為生活磨折而失去的，</p>
<p>紅潤的膚色，在雯那閒，又在你</p>
<p>臉上重現了。</p>
<p>朋友，拭去瞼上失意的淚痕</p>
<p>忘掉心坎痛恨的抑鬱吧！</p>
<p>來，請問乾此一杯。</p>

<h3>秋水</h3>
<p>— 滄谷</p>
<p>古老的年月，不知是那一個</p>
<p>瘦詩人，把一泓秋水，比做伊人</p>
<p>明亮的眸于。這是個妥切不過的</p>
<p>比喻，像一種不可抗拒的力，召</p>
<p>喚猜年靑的一代，用詩句去謳歌</p>
<p>，用靈魄去擁抱。那終古淸冷的</p>
<p>秋水，在詩人不朽的想像裏，溫</p>
<p>暖地流動了。</p>
<p>我是一個年靑人，我對於秋</p>
<p>水的喜悅，當然不能例外；對於</p>
<p>詩人的想像，也同樣會感到親切</p>
<p>的。我愛秋水的淸淺，但是我更</p>
<p>愛小橋下秋水低聲訴設的故事。</p>
<p>秋水是個很愛設話的姑娘，</p>
<p>只要你有能耐，她儘會像情人一</p>
<p>樣，向你訴說她所熟悉的故事。</p>
<p>有一次，她說了一尾黃色的</p>
<p>小鯽魚，和浣衣小姑娘白手臂</p>
<p>愛的故事。她設每當小姑娘那雙</p>
<p>細膩白淨的小手臂在水裏攪動時</p>
<p>，那尾黃色的小鯽魚，就瘋狂地</p>
<p>追逐，瘋狂地唼喋·有時候，速</p>
<p>結着隊的游魚，也給衝散了。那</p>
<p>小姑娘也常常張着手掌網羅牠，</p>
<p>有一天，牠終於被提出了水面，</p>
<p>開始感到窒息的恐慌；但是為了</p>
<p>愛情的緣故，牠承受着極度的痛</p>
<p>苦，一些也不想脫逃。那小姑娘</p>
<p>溫柔的眼光，流露着母性的憐憫</p>
<p>，把這癡情的小生物摔出了幾尺</p>
<p>遠的水面，這黃色的小鯽魚從此</p>
<p>失戀了。</p>
<p>這些故事，在前些村居的日</p>
<p>子，我聽得很多視多，那時候，</p>
<p>我還沒有學會像中年人一樣，懂</p>
<p>得享受寂寞的。我想忘去這與死</p>
<p>接近的寂寞，於是，我循着紅蘿</p>
<p>花開滿的河塘，去聽取美麗傳奇</p>
<p>，去尋覓自己頎長的影子。我諦</p>
<p>視着水面的影子，我發覺在這人</p>
<p>間，我並不怎麼孤獨。我笑了，</p>
<p>那水裏的影子也笑了。</p>
<p>也許是「鴻雁來時，無限思</p>
<p>量」。我，這樣一個安於平凡和</p>
<p>淡漠的人，却會據起了無端的相</p>
<p>思。我懷念着終古淸冷的秋水，</p>
<p>也懷念着眸子明亮的伊人；但最</p>
<p>淡忘不了的，還是一迎串褪了色</p>
<p>的故事。</p>
<p>秋天，我感到一陣空虛和恨</p>
<p>惘。</p>
<h3>詩語録</h3>
<p>— 溶東</p>
<p>詩給我們的是簡單和：……</p>
<p>無彩色的喜悅。</p>
<p>我想，移注情感是詩的特殊</p>
<p>的工作——並不是傳達思想，而</p>
<p>是在讀者的感官裏喚起一種擺動</p>
<p>，這種擺動與作家所感覺的擺動</p>
<p>是符合的。</p>
<p>詩應有宏壯的詩韻——一股</p>
<p>强而不理智的興奮抖擻……，</p>
<p>它能吸引淚，能進入人心，去找</p>
<p>到在那裏隱藏潛伏着的某件東西</p>
<p>，那件東西比他此刻性格的組織</p>
<p>還要古老……。（A.E.Ho</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>耀羣：「其先，本來預備在道破旅館</p>
<p>門前，留下暗號；可又書怕被那買沙夫傢</p>
<p>伙發見，只好不用。稍為吃了點飲食，便</p>
<p>趕着走到街上，晃來晃去；一方面守候虎</p>
<p>弟，一方面希望虎弟能夠在這短短的一個</p>
<p>多小時內，能從那邊旅館裹，收到我的字</p>
<p>條趕到這裏，買下了旅館屋子。可是自己</p>
<p>心裏也想着好笑；世界上哪有這等一想情</p>
<p>願的奇蹟？</p>
<p>「蹓　了沒有多少幾步路忽然聽得身</p>
<p>後有人冷笑的際音，冷笑之中，還離着言</p>
<p>語，可是聽不眞說的什麼。在當時緊張的</p>
<p>情緒中，固然有些神經過敏，而實際在下</p>
<p>意識上，確也有些感覺到有些不妙；因為</p>
<p>這裏人來人往，車聲轔磷，人聲嘈雜，這</p>
<p>冷笑的聲音，偏生那麼分外的刺耳，從我</p>
<p>身後變了出來。比及我回頭一瞧，却又不</p>
<p>看見有什麽異態的人物，不過幾個普通行</p>
<p>人而已。我自己的感覺，很勉強的告訴自</p>
<p>己：「一次被蛇咬，三年怕斷繩！……</p>
<p>不過是杯弓蛇影罷了。」……</p>
<p>「那裏料到，再走了不大一段路，猛</p>
<p>然看見迎頭不遠，有兩個不三不四的壯漢</p>
<p>，壁面向我這裏過了過來，動作上有些攔</p>
<p>住我的去路欖樣，一瞧我注意了他們，兩</p>
<p>個傢伙忽地停了腳步。根據我的經驗雖然</p>
<p>覺得這兩個傢伙，形跡不對，並且又睜起</p>
<p>兩雙怪眼，遙遙注射着我，我也只能當他</p>
<p>不是那麼一會事，仍舊保特我原來的態度</p>
<p>，朝前走了去。離開道兩傢伙不到三五碼</p>
<p>遠近，猛見他們同時伸開兩雙胳膊，作出</p>
<p>阻攔的式樣。其中之一，大聲對我喝道；</p>
<p>「喂，打住罷，你！」……</p>
<p>「起頭我並不理會，勉強當他是對我</p>
<p>身後的人說話，連頭也不回轉；表示坦白</p>
<p>。誰知我剛這麼又走了兩步，那發話的</p>
<p>傢伙，對着我狠狠的狂吼起來：「你到底</p>
<p>站住不站住？」接着露出一臉的獰笑；「</p>
<p>反穿皮襖，你還裝着是什麽佯哪！」……</p>
<p>「還時候任是如可鎭靜，我也不能不</p>
<p>回頭探瞧一下，心裏只有一個念頭：希望</p>
<p>這兩傢伙這種突如其來的舉動，是對我身</p>
<p>後的什麼人發出的。誰知我回頭一瞧，唉</p>
<p>！三四個彪形大漢，手上都露出了傢伙，</p>
<p>像拾着寶貝似的，面孔上一律掛着不可思</p>
<p>議的怪笑，好像是說：「上了圈套了哪！</p>
<p>：……瞧你往那裏跑？」……</p>
<p>「我並沒有抵抗，也無法抵抗；就這</p>
<p>麼糊糊塗塗地跟着他們走了幾步，又跟着</p>
<p>他們上了一部停在路邊的汽車；也糊糊塗</p>
<p>塗的到了一個好像警察局辦公處模樣的地</p>
<p>方，糊糊塗塗的躭了下來……」</p>
<p>「慢着，您讓我猜一猜，」我聽了耀</p>
<p>羣說到這裏，忽然插口問：「我想遭一切</p>
<p>的一切，大概都是那位買先生的一套魔衛</p>
<p>吧？……」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？可是直到當天下午三點</p>
<p>鐘，日偽方面的警務人員，把買沙夫搬弄</p>
<p>了出來，給我當面對證，我……</p>
<p>我聽到道裏，又插口問耀羣：「那傢</p>
<p>伙是用什麽姿態出場的？」</p>
<p>「同我一樣，也是被捕。」耀羣笑着</p>
<p>說。</p>
<p>「淺薄哪？」我搖搖頭，「這不是太</p>
<p>淺薄了嗎？」</p>

<h3>U.S. Revises Aid to China Steps, Wei Envoy's Report Not Released, Foreign Minister Wang Leaves US and Arrives in Tokyo Tonight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the U.S. State Department's statement that the confidential report on the investigation of China and Korea by Wei Demai would not be published, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. Furthermore, the meaning and nature of the U.S. statement's ending phrase, "If the report were to be published at this time, it would be inappropriate and detrimental to the interests of all countries concerned," was also not discussed. According to authoritative sources, the U.S. government's motivation for not publishing Wei's report has been revealed in this annotation. The U.S. must have seriously considered its Far East policy while intensifying the implementation of the Marshall Plan for European aid. Regarding the Korean part, the signs can already be seen in the firm stance and strengthened actions recently expressed by the U.S. in the UN General Assembly. Therefore, the U.S. policy towards China will not remain undecided for much longer. From the breakdown of the government and communist negotiations at the end of October last year to Marshal's departure from China this spring, the U.S. has learned from several non-trivial events and situations the rather serious consequences of its ambiguous policy. It is believed that as a result of the frequent and earnest talks between the three foreign ministers in the U.S. with President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Undersecretary of State Lovett, they must have broadly exchanged opinions on the current general economic, political, and military situation in China. The time for the announcement of the U.S. revision of its China policy and the adoption of aid to China steps should not be far off.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The U.S. State Department announced on the 20th that General Wei Demai's report on China and Korea would not be published at this time. The full text of the State Department's statement is as follows: The outside world is currently urging the publication of the report made by General Wei Demai after he returned to the United States from the Far East in mid-September. President Truman dispatched General Wei Demai to China and Korea in July as his personal representative to investigate the situation in the two countries. After Wei completed his mission and returned to the country in September, he submitted his confidential investigation report to the President and the State Department. Much of the information was obtained from private individuals in China and Korea, American representatives in the two countries, and senior officials of the Chinese government. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to publish the report at this time and would be detrimental to the interests of all countries concerned (including the United States).</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] According to unofficial sources: Wei Demai's report stated that the Soviet Union was in danger of taking over all nine provinces of Northeast China within six months and suggested that the U.S. support the government led by Chairman Chiang of China, advocating the adoption of a large-scale aid program similar to the aid to Greece and Turkey plan. Some points in Wei's report conflicted with the suggestions made by Marshall after his mission to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] President Truman stated last week that Secretary of State Marshall would issue a statement on Wei Demai's report within a few days. The State Department's statement on the 20th was clearly fulfilling the President's promise. This is enough to indicate that Marshall's statement on the future U.S. policy towards China may be delayed for some time.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] Chinese Foreign Minister and Head of the Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Dr. Wang Shijie, left the United States on the 20th and is expected to arrive in Tokyo at 7:01 p.m. on the 22nd (Tokyo time).</p>
<h3>Draft Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreement Approved by Legislative Yuan; Deliberation on Salt Tax Rate Adjustment Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan held its 336th regular meeting on the morning of the 21st, discussing more than 20 tax and election-related proposals, making it one of the busiest days since the resumption of the session. The meeting was chaired by President Sun Ke and passed important proposals including: the draft Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreement, the organization regulations of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee, the amended House Tax Regulations, the amended Slaughter Tax Law, the amended Vehicle License Tax Law, the amended Business Tax Law, the amended regulations on raising standards for fines and monetary penalties and the Administrative Execution Law, the amended regulations on the organization law of the Ministry of Interior, the case of changing the number of National Assembly representatives with special living habits in the mainland to 17, and the case of increasing the number of National Assembly representatives from Xinjiang. (The content of the Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreement and the organizational regulations of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee can be found in Column 4 of Section 2)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the method of adjusting the salt tax rate and the case of raising various local tax rates on the morning of the 21st, most legislators expressed dissatisfaction with the government's increase in the burden on the people, which did not meet the principle of fairness, resulting in an excessive burden on the poor. Moreover, if the adjustment of the tax rate was not completed through legislative procedures in advance, it would be inconsistent with the law in many ways. As a result, the deliberation of the method of adjusting the salt tax rate was postponed, and the amended law on banquets and entertainment tax was returned for review.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Decides to Ask Government to Pay Attention to Election Fraud</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The case of whether to separately stipulate special laws and regulations to prevent election fraud was brought up again at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 21st, and aroused another heated debate. The main reason for those who opposed the separate establishment of new laws was that the criminal law and relevant election laws and regulations already had provisions regarding the punishment of election fraud, and it seemed unnecessary to separately stipulate them. Wang Yuxiang and Chen Zifeng pointed out that the current elections in our country are "extremely tightly controlled" and are elections from top to bottom. The Legislative Yuan does not need to do anything extra. Lin Bin put forward a compromise view, explaining that the time for formulating separate laws has already passed. In addition to requesting the National Government to order all competent authorities to earnestly implement the law when election fraud occurs, the Legislative Yuan should also ask the judicial police, court prosecutors, supervisory committee members, and supervisors to actively pay attention to the occurrence of fraud and should encourage society to expose it, so as to establish a model for constitutional government. In the end, it was passed according to Lin Bin's opinion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Shanghai Municipal Council, etc., previously stated that the status of municipalities directly under the central government is important and cannot be regarded as the same area as counties and cities, and telegraphed the central government, requesting that each district of the municipalities directly under the central government should return one National Assembly representative. This case was brought up at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 21st. Most legislators believed that the constitution takes counties and cities as the unit for the election of National Assembly representatives, and there is no distinction between municipalities directly under the central government and provincial-level cities. As for the districts of municipalities directly under the central government, which are the same area as counties and cities, their nature is also different. There is no legal basis for the request, and it was not passed.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Resolution: Appoint Presidents of Beiyang and Northeast Universities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan held its 26th meeting on the morning of the 21st, chaired by President Zhang. It was passed to appoint Liu Xianzhou as the president of National Beiyang University, Liu Shuxun as the president of Northeast University, Li Shizhen as the president of the Central Police Academy, and Sun Guijing as the mayor of Changchun. The resolutions of each case are selected and recorded as follows: (Continued on Section 2, Column 2)</p>
<h3>China's Status Becoming Stronger, British "Economist" Comments</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 21st] The influential British weekly "The Economist" has a lengthy main commentary this week discussing China's policy and its basic position in world affairs. The article stated: "Today there is indeed a central government in China whose power is much greater than the Beijing government in 1919 or 1921, but after the long war of resistance against Japan, followed by civil war and economic chaos, China's status has been weakened, making it only a great power in name, but not in reality, in the international arena. However, even at this time, it would be a great mistake to underestimate the pivotal factor of China's role in international affairs. China is like a giant, still half-awake and half-asleep, but it does not change the fact that it is a giant. If compared with the situation at the Washington Conference 25 years ago, there has been great progress, and Chinese diplomats also have great confidence in the future, and years of war have given China a legal status, which is still a powerful asset."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] Airdropped troops will arrive successively from Shenyang to Changchun starting today to strengthen the strength of the National Army in Jilin and Changchun.</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Review of General Central Relations</h3>
<p>After touring in the North, the British Parliamentary Delegation to China</p>
<p>flew to this city yesterday morning from Hangzhou, one of my</p>
<p>country's famous scenic spots. After arriving in Shanghai,</p>
<p>in addition to visiting the mayor, they first hosted Chinese and foreign reporters, and at the invitation of the Municipal</p>
<p>Council, participated in a luncheon where they exchanged views. We</p>
<p>feel extremely gratified by the esteemed guests' tour of inspection and by listening to the speeches they have made in various places. Although this newspaper has already commented on the issue of inland river navigation rights yesterday, we hope to further offer our views on the general relationship between China and Britain before the esteemed guests return to their country.</p>
<p>First, we feel that China and Britain have many points in common,</p>
<p>and the difficulties they encounter are also similar. We sincerely admire our British</p>
<p>friends. They are truly hardworking, energetic, planned, courageous,</p>
<p>and methodical in dealing with one difficult situation after another. These actions of our British friends provide us with many</p>
<p>things to emulate. Our government and the public,</p>
<p>are willing to emulate and encourage ourselves with the methods of our British friends at all times. Because there are many points in common between China and Britain, only British friends can</p>
<p>truly understand and appreciate China's difficulties and the crux of the problem. We do not need to repeat all the words that the distinguished guests have disclosed in the newspapers in recent days, we only</p>
<p>feel a kind of closeness and resonance.</p>
<p>Second, what we want to point out is that although Britain is currently</p>
<p>experiencing unprecedented economic hardship, its national strength has been greatly diminished, and its vitality cannot be easily restored for a time: Britain still occupies an extremely important</p>
<p>position in world, especially European, politics. The situation in Europe is truly riddled with holes and about to collapse</p>
<p>. The Communist International is taking advantage of the situation, engulfing half of the country, and placing it all within the "Iron Curtain" in one fell swoop. Although the United States is advocating aid to Europe with unparalleled strength,</p>
<p>and acting as a pillar of strength in spirit, trying to turn the tide,</p>
<p>the only country that echoes and seeks help from the United States is Britain. Britain's situation in</p>
<p>Europe is the same as China's in Asia. Today, China</p>
<p>is experiencing an unprecedentedly bad time, but as long as China's independence and sovereignty</p>
<p>are not lost, the red flames of poison will never be able to rage in Asia, and the tranquility of the Far East will never be shaken. Today, the situation of China and Britain is truly what is called "a dark and stormy night, but the cock crows incessantly," and the heaviness of their hearts</p>
<p>cannot be understood by outsiders.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that the insight and vision of the British are worthy of admiration. During the eight years of the War of Resistance and up to now, the overall situation in the Far East has undergone</p>
<p>tremendous changes, and China's situation is dangerous and shocking. There has been much international</p>
<p>criticism and praise! Only Britain, for many years, has not given us excessive praise, nor has it criticized us for perfection. They have always made calm observations and calmly stated fair opinions, which is worthy of our gratitude.</p>
<p>In short, we have unlimited hopes for the arrival of the British delegation to China. We believe that in the future, the tranquility of the Far East and</p>
<p>the understanding and cooperation between China and Britain are as important as the cooperation and mutual assistance between China and the United States. We especially believe that the British government's recent changes in colonial policy</p>
<p>are extremely wise. Perhaps some people will lament the decline</p>
<p>of the British Empire because of this, but they do not know that this action of Britain has added some goodwill and sympathy to Great Britain. How can those who are obsessed with the wreckage estimate this psychological gain?</p>
<p>The current British government figures are far-sighted and have penetrating vision. How can they only focus on narrow calculations in front of them?</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more point that this newspaper's editorial yesterday already mentioned, and</p>
<p>today we would like to reiterate, which is the issue of China's inland river navigation rights. According to the British friends' view, it seems that it is permissible to open</p>
<p>China's inland river navigation to Britain, because Britain's inland river navigation is also open to other countries, and they say that Chinese</p>
<p>ships can go to New York, Boston, and the Danube, so why can't British ships go to inland ports in China? As far as we know, among all the countries in the world, only Britain</p>
<p>opens its inland rivers. But in fact, for the past 150 years, the world's maritime rights have been completely in the hands of Britain, so</p>
<p>although British inland rivers are open, no country's ships have taken advantage of them. Other countries protect their inland river navigation rights. Even the United States, which shares the same culture and is also a major maritime power as Britain,</p>
<p>protects its inland river navigation rights. Not only does it protect inland river navigation rights, but also, in terms of the railway bureau, it has formulated</p>
<p>inspection laws to promote the use of American ships for the export of goods, in order to prevent the outflow of interests. This is one point. Secondly, if</p>
<p>Chinese ships can go to New York and Boston as an example, then foreign ships can now</p>
<p>go to Shanghai and Guangzhou. Shanghai is fifteen miles away from the Wusongkou, and is not</p>
<p>a seaport, but there is no doubt that it cannot be compared to the opening of inland river navigation rights. This is the second point. As for using the Danube River as an example, we all know that</p>
<p>the Danube River is an international waterway, and cannot be compared to any inland river. This is the third point</p>
<p>. Based on these three points, we have always believed that the protection of inland river navigation rights</p>
<p>cannot be changed. Of course, doing so is a heavy burden on our country's economy. Because important foreign</p>
<p>materials can be transported to inland ports such as Nanjing and Hankou, the cost of loading, unloading, and transshipment in Shanghai can be avoided. And this cost, given the high fluctuations in Shanghai's prices, is often more expensive than the entire freight from Britain. However, we must state that this is a matter of national</p>
<p>policy, and cannot be considered solely from the perspective of whether it is economically worthwhile for the country. Our position can be understood by all countries that have made arduous struggles in national economy and foreign trade. Britain is undoubtedly advanced in this regard. We believe that our position will eventually</p>
<p>gain their resonance.</p>
<p>This is the second time in the last ten years that a British delegation to China has come to China. The first time was during the war. We reporters met with British guests in the Jialing New Village in Chongqing. Since then, a Chinese delegation to Britain has been formed. Time flies quickly, and several years have passed in an instant. Today's situation is different from that time. And as the Shanghai Municipal Council said at the welcome banquet yesterday afternoon, there are still many difficulties lying in front of us that require the joint struggle of China and Britain. We would like to suggest that while the esteemed guests are taking a break and returning home, we should study and encourage each other together.</p>
<h3>Sir Almond Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>"This newspaper reports" The British delegation of parliamentarians held a press conference at the municipal government auditorium at 11:00 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Many Chinese and foreign reporters from this city attended.</p>
<p>Mr. MacFarlane, Director of the British Information Office, was also present.</p>
<p>Sir Almond, the head of the delegation, gave brief and general answers to the written questions raised by the reporters.</p>
<p>The details are as follows: The negotiations on the Sino-British Trade Agreement</p>
<p>are not within the scope of the delegation's duties, so it is inconvenient to answer. As for the issue of Britain sending experts to China, if China agrees, Britain is very willing to send them. The delegation will do its best to promote this. Britain has previously sent experts to India to</p>
<p>assist in agricultural improvements. As for the difficulty of British commercial firms in China in rotation, it is being negotiated by the relevant authorities of China and Britain. Regarding the pension issue for the former employees dismissed by the Public Works Bureau, it is being handled by the Chinese authorities, and it is believed that it will be fair and reasonable. Regarding the issue of China opening inland river navigation, the delegation is inconvenient to answer, because this delegation is purely a group to promote friendship and has not participated in this negotiation. However, it is willing to make any suggestions to enhance the friendship between your countries. Regarding the issue of Hong Kong's return to China, the delegation is inconvenient to answer. Regarding Britain's wartime losses and the recovery plan, during the war, Britain's civil industries turned into military industries by as much as</p>
<p>47 percent. Overseas investment losses are more than</p>
<p>half, and foreign debt has increased sharply. In addition to strengthening production and exports, the recovery plan will strictly limit the import of non-essential goods. If you pay attention to the British Parliament's essays, you will definitely understand everything. Regarding the situation of the British newspaper industry after the war, freedom of speech has increased considerably. The issue of Britain limiting its own industrial standards is not within the scope of this delegation's answers. The historical city of Beijing and the commercial center of Tianjin have made excellent impressions, especially the warm friendship of the people in North China, which will be deeply remembered.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Executive Yuan (Continued from the previous page)</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Province Intensifies Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>[Continued from the previous page] Director Zhang Fa-kui of the Guangzhou Headquarters and Chairman Song Zi-wen negotiated with General Li Fu-lin, a senior general in Guangdong and a member of the Central Committee, to take on an important position in a certain pacification area. It is reported that Li has agreed to this and expressed that he will do his best to assist the government in mobilizing his old troops to organize self-defense forces to suppress bandits and quell the chaos. Li recently summoned his old troops to discuss the matter, and the result was that if they wanted to pacify the banditry in the province, it was estimated that they would have to form an armed force equivalent to ten regiments of the National Army before they could succeed. Director Zhang and Chairman Song have agreed to this in principle, and it is reported that Song said that the required armed equipment can be planned and decided by the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] It is reported that Chairman Song is organizing a political secret investigation team to secretly expose corrupt officials at any time in order to rectify the officialdom in Guangdong Province. It is said that this organization will be responsible for by veteran revolutionaries who have remained in Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Mr. Rooks' Report to Reporters</h3>
<p>(Continued from the previous page) The task of the committee is to continue the unfinished work of UNRRA and CNRRA, and to sell materials, such as a large amount of cotton that urgently needs to be sold off. The foreign exchange for the sale of these materials can be provided by the UNRRA Central Committee. The Central Committee may provide US$5 million to pay the salaries of foreign workers remaining in China who have not completed the training of technicians in Bubu A. In addition, the council can budget for the expenses of various necessary tasks, has the right to inspect various tasks, introduce the use of materials, and select management personnel.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of supplying materials to the communist areas, Mr. Rooks stated that UNRRA's basic policy is to provide relief and supplies to all those in need, and is not limited to ethnicity, religion, or any political faction. He specifically raised this point when he met with Chairman Chiang this time. He said: I hope there may be a solution, but I am also deeply aware of the difficulties of the current situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Rooks specifically pointed out fishery measures in post-war reconstruction. He said: UNRRA plans to sell some of the fishing boats to Chinese private fishermen, but some of them must also be equipped with new equipment to create a complete enterprise to develop China's fishing industry. In addition, agricultural machinery and the Yellow River Flood Area Restoration Engineering Vision are all long-term tasks.</p>
<p>Mr. Rooks stated that the UNRRA organization in China will be closed at the end of this year, but a small number of personnel must be retained to handle internal closing matters, so the final closing will be around the end of March or April next year.</p>
<p>At yesterday's reception, Mr. Rooks repeatedly expressed his gratitude to our government, and expressed his deep gratitude to Mr. Cleveland, Director of the UNRRA China Office, Mr. Hubbell, Director of the CNRRA, and their staff, believing that the work of UNRRA and CNRRA was quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Business Targets Determined for Post-War Rehabilitation Commission; Organizational Regulations Passed by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] The Executive Yuan</p>
<p>has decided to establish a Post-War Rehabilitation Commission in order to coordinate with international relief supplies and continue to handle the post-war</p>
<p>rehabilitation and relief work that has not been completed after the closure of UNRRA and CNRRA. The organizational regulations of the commission were submitted to and passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting today. In the future, the commission's responsibilities will be: restoration work in the Yellow River Flood Area, fishing vessels and machine vessels, mechanized farming and the manufacture of agricultural implements, demonstration work in rural industries, and other unfinished post-war projects approved and assigned by the Executive Yuan. The commission will have a chairman and twelve members. The unfinished post-war projects of CNRRA will be transferred to the commission for takeover, and a Yellow River Flood Area Restoration Bureau will be established separately. The long-term post-war supplies donated by UNRRA will be handed over to a custody committee for management. The members of the committee will be hired from domestic people with social expectations and representatives from relevant UN agencies. The period from the establishment to the closure of the commission is set for a total of two years.</p>
<h3>Content of the Draft Agreement on Sino-Siamese Air Transportation</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] The draft agreement on Sino-Siamese air transportation was passed at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 21st. The agreement stipulates that both contracting countries agree that the agreement will be valid for four years and that the number of flights will be limited to once per week for the time being. Regarding the issue of shipping operations between Hong Kong and Shanghai, due to the special status of Hong Kong, other countries are not allowed to operate passenger and cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Our opinion is clearly stated in the footnote of the draft agreement. Regarding the early start of air transport operations, our side advocated that the Sino-Thai route should be opened before the formal signing of the agreement, and the Thai side has agreed. As for the route and commercial aviation station issues, during the negotiations between the two sides, the original draft of the Thai side proposed three routes, two of which were from Bangkok to Shanghai, and then to Japan and the United States. The other route was from Bangkok to Guangzhou and back to Bangkok. Our side only allowed the opening of one route and the opening of one place in Shanghai or Guangzhou as a commercial aviation station. Now both sides agree to one Bangkok-Shanghai route and the opening of Shanghai as a commercial aviation station.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Carrying Foreign Currency Back to China; Review of Quota Provisions</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] The Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>held a regular meeting on the morning of the 21st. When discussing and amending Article 7 of the Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency, Wang Quan and others appealed on behalf of the overseas Chinese returning to the country. According to the regulations: "Anyone who enters the country and carries foreign currency in their possession, except for US$100 or its equivalent in other currencies, must register with the customs for the amount exceeding the quota and exchange it for national currency at the local Central Bank or its entrusted exchange office on the day of entry. Those who conceal and fail to report after being questioned by the customs shall have it confiscated." This is very inconvenient for overseas Chinese who return to their original place after returning to the country. President Sun also believes that the convenience of returning overseas Chinese should be taken into consideration. For example, if an overseas Chinese carries US$10,000 back to the country, only US$100 is allowed to be imported, and the remaining US$9,900 must be exchanged for national currency. When they leave the country, they must exchange the national currency for US dollars again, which will result in a considerable loss. If it is stipulated that US$100 can be imported and the excess is allowed to be deposited in the bank and withdrawn when they leave the country, it would be more fair. It was decided to return this case for review.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Cotton Industry Appeals; Joint Office Promises to Consider</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st of this month] Ten representatives from the Shanghai Municipal</p>
<p>Cotton Business Association, including Liu Pingsun,</p>
<p>went to the Joint Office on the morning of the 20th to</p>
<p>request the cancellation of the method of requiring cotton deposits based on yarn mill orders. Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan received them.</p>
<p>He said that the opinions expressed by the representatives</p>
<p>were very reasonable and promised to reconsider them. In the afternoon, they went</p>
<p>to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Chen Qitian said that the decision-making power on this matter was in the Central Bank, and he would conduct close research with Zhang Jia'ao and Xu Baiyuan. Chen also hoped that the Cotton Association</p>
<p>would quickly change the old scale to the market scale in the Shanghai area</p>
<p>in order to achieve uniformity. The representatives of the association have agreed to implement it from November</p>
<p>1st.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Harvest; A Total of 11 Million Piculs; A New Record in the Past 11 Years</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Beiping on the 21st of this month] This</p>
<p>year's national cotton</p>
<p>harvest is a new</p>
<p>record in the past 11</p>
<p>years. The national</p>
<p>total output reaches</p>
<p>11 million dan,</p>
<p>an increase of 4</p>
<p>million dan compared</p>
<p>to last year. Feng Zefang, Deputy Director of the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, told reporters: 1936 was the year with the highest output since China planted cotton. The national output reached 17 million dan. In that year, the national cotton demand was sufficient for self-sufficiency. Although this year's output is still lower than that of 1936, it is fortunate to have this output after the war. This year, 21 cotton ginning factories will be established nationwide to concentrate cotton ginning in order to purchase fine seeds and benefit the promotion in the coming year. In terms of purchasing, they will cooperate as much as possible with yarn mills such as China Textile and Shenxin, because there is a lack of foreign exchange this year, and the yarn mills can no longer purchase American cotton, so it is urgent to solve the raw material problem domestically. Recently, various yarn mills will send personnel with funds to the designated cotton ginning factories to purchase cotton. In addition, the China Agricultural Corporation has allocated 300 billion to establish the China Agricultural Transportation Company, which also takes the purchase of cotton as its main business. Feng said: This year, the summer rain in the Yangtze River area was abundant, the temperature was high enough, and there was no autumn rain, which was most suitable for cotton growth, and the production was particularly abundant. Hubei Province alone produced 2.4 million dan (ranking first in the country), and Jiangsu produced 1.7 million dan (ranking second). Unfortunately, more than 1 million dan of Shaanxi cotton could not be transported out due to the obstruction of the Longhai Railway, resulting in heavy losses to the country and the local area.</p>
<h3>Bandit Extortion and Sabotage; Hong Kong-Guangdong Transportation Suspended</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, Evening 11] Bandits in Guangdong Province</p>

<h3>Full Text of Speaker Pan's Welcome Speech at the Reception for the British Parliamentary Delegation to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Speaker Pan delivered a welcome speech at the reception for the British Parliamentary Delegation to China. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Distinguished members of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, Mayor Wu, honored guests: Today, I have the opportunity to represent the Shanghai Municipal Council in welcoming the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, and I feel deeply honored and delighted. I believe that all my colleagues on the council share my particular pleasure, because as members of a local council, we often regard the British legislative system as the "Mother of Parliaments." I dare to imagine that you gentlemen, upon arriving in Shanghai, will feel a special sense of intimacy, as if you have come home, because for more than a hundred years, Shanghai has been the most prominent place for cooperation between Chinese and foreign individuals, especially between Chinese and British individuals. Over the past century, the cooperation between Chinese and British individuals in Shanghai has led to significant progress in economic, commercial, and cultural terms, benefiting both Chinese and foreign individuals. Today, in my capacity as the Speaker of the Municipal Council, I would like to express the sentiments of all the councilors here, that although the environment in Shanghai has changed, the spirit of cooperation between the Chinese and British people, and even between Chinese and foreign individuals, will be further promoted and enhanced due to the abolition of unequal treaties. Shanghai is an international city, and as the elected representatives of Shanghai, we certainly do not want to seek to implement a "closed-door" policy. We hope that international cooperation will create a greater, more prosperous, and more beautiful Shanghai. All Shanghai residents, regardless of nationality or belief, should work together to make Shanghai a city they can be proud of.</p>
<p>In many ways, the current situation in Shanghai is related to the overall situation in China. In addition to suffering greatly from inflation and a shortage of supplies, the citizens are also being subjected to deceitful words and harmful rhetoric aimed at destabilizing Shanghai by those with ulterior motives. The fundamental difficulties facing Shanghai today, such as the obstruction of material supplies and trade, can only be resolved when the Chinese Communists abandon their method of using force as a tool for political struggle.</p>
<p>I believe that during your travels, you gentlemen will see many other cities in other countries that have suffered even more damage than Shanghai. From a purely material point of view, Shanghai seems extremely fortunate, but as an organic city, it has suffered great pain. After eight years of war and four years of occupation, the municipal organization and public welfare undertakings created by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the French Concession over many years have fallen into a state of disintegration. During this period, Shanghai's roads were in disrepair, parks were overgrown, and the underground sewer system was damaged due to lack of maintenance. When our administration took over Shanghai after the victory, Shanghai was no longer the vibrant and orderly city it once was, but a city with disintegrated public and private organizations, leaving only an empty shell. Rebuilding Shanghai is a difficult task, virtually starting from scratch, patching up the potholes in the roads, sweeping away the garbage, starting to rebuild the underground sewer system, and the surge in population has made the city's housing and transportation problems extremely serious. During the concession era, of course, no preparations were made to supply the needs of nearly five million residents. The planning of streets, buildings, and public utilities did not take into account the need to meet the demands of nearly five million residents. Therefore, it is obvious that all expansion and reconstruction work cannot be done to ideal satisfaction in a short period. The enemy puppets took eight years to directly and indirectly destroy Shanghai, and the time required for our reconstruction work may take at least that long. Over the past two years, we have been determined to do what we can with limited funds, and under the capable leadership of Mayor Wu, we have made a good start. We sincerely hope that friends from other countries can understand the difficulties and complexities of our problems, and in turn, assist us in completing the arduous task of modernizing and rebuilding Shanghai.</p>
<p>I believe that because you and the people of your country are facing your own crisis with unwavering courage and determination, you will be able to understand the difficult problems of China and Shanghai. Because China fought alone for four years, other countries had time to organize their forces and prepare. The deaths of our soldiers and civilians, the destruction of cities, and the desolation of fields have allowed other countries to prepare calmly. You gentlemen, during your travels throughout China, must have witnessed the tragic results of eight years of destruction. Railways have been destroyed, and reconstruction will take several years. The people all have tired and sorrowful expressions. All of this is the result of the heavy blow of war. But at that time, we bravely endured the pain without complaint, because we firmly believed that after the end of the war, the Allied countries that were more fortunate and not directly destroyed by the war would be grateful for our sacrifice and assist us in our reconstruction. On this point, we still have deep faith. We do not consider it shameful to ask for foreign aid to restore China's pre-war economic stability, because we deserve the assistance of friendly nations. China and the Chinese people have already paid the price with their lives, broken homes, and vast disaster areas during eight years of bitter fighting. If the situation were reversed, China would certainly have provided assistance to the Allied countries that suffered harm at the time, without hesitation and without making commercial calculations. Under our traditional Confucian thought, we consider it a responsibility, a way of interacting.</p>
<p>Because you are friends of China, you are certainly saddened by China's current internal strife and political instability. But because you are experienced politicians with a clear understanding of the international situation, you undoubtedly know that our country's political problems are not a purely internal matter.</p>
<p>I do not want to deliberately alarm you, but in China, you are witnessing the opening of an even greater struggle. However, many people in our country believe that, as in the case of the "July 7th Incident," our country will again stand on the front line of a major struggle, in which all people are bound to be threatened. In the past week, the organization of the Comintern Information Bureau in Belgrade has attracted the attention of people all over the world, but for the Chinese people, this is not news. Long before this organization, there was already a similar institution in China, under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, including all communist organizations in Asia. If the European Comintern is a threat and a challenge, then China has been threatened for a long time. You gentlemen all know that the Chinese people are a peaceful nation. We are willing to live in peace in order to carry out reconstruction. After the Yalta Secret Agreement (an agreement we did not participate in), we paid the price stipulated in the agreement without complaint. This is the most profound expression of our desire for peace. At that time, we believed that our sacrifices were the price paid for the benefit of all Allied countries. Today, we feel that since China has suffered sacrifices for the common interests of the Allied countries, it should not bear all the evil consequences of this matter alone.</p>
<p>I said just now that you, the members of the delegation to China, and the people of your country, because you yourselves are overcoming the crisis with courage and determination, will certainly be able to understand our problems and tragedies. Our two great nations are in a common difficult situation, and at the same time, we are facing a common threat. I deeply feel that our success depends on our joint efforts. On this day of sincerely welcoming you, allow me to propose a toast to the health of the King of England, and to the success of our common struggle.</p>
<h3>Sir Ammon's Response</h3>
<p>Speaker Pan concluded his speech. Sir Ammon stood up and responded, welcoming Speaker Pan's statement: "We certainly do not want to seek to implement a closed-door policy, and hope that international cooperation will create a greater, more prosperous, and more beautiful Shanghai." Sir Ammon praised the rapid reconstruction of Shanghai, and said that although the United Kingdom could not provide China with material assistance in the past month, it had deep sympathy for China's reconstruction. Sir Ammon emphasized that the cooperation between China and the United Kingdom would enhance the interest of peace-loving countries in working for peace.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Responds to Molotov, Rejects Withdrawal of Occupation Forces from Korea, Entire Plan Awaits UN Handling, Vyshinsky Sharply Criticizes U.S. Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The United States has effectively rejected the Soviet proposal for the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea in early 1948, stating that the entire issue of Korean independence must now await a decision by the United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. State Department today released a note from Acting Secretary of State Lovett to Foreign Minister Molotov, pointing out that the United States has placed the issue of establishing an independent Korean government on the agenda of the General Assembly. The U.S. government believes that the withdrawal of occupation forces from Korea should be seen as an integral part of the solution to the entire issue. According to Secretary of State Marshall's letter to UN Secretary-General Lie on Friday of last week, it was recommended that the United Nations establish a committee to hold elections in Korea in early February next year, followed by preparations for the withdrawal of troops.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st] The Soviet delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, led by Mr. Shetekov, departed from Seoul at 1:00 PM today and arrived at Pyongyang Airport at 1:55 PM, following government orders. Before his departure, Mr. Shetekov made a brief statement condemning the U.S. delegation for deliberately making it impossible to implement the Moscow Agreement in Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing, 20th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky today criticized the U.S. proposal for UN supervision of elections to establish a democratic government in Korea, and the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from the entire Korean peninsula. In a speech to the General Assembly on the Greek issue, Mr. Vyshinsky accused the U.S. proposal of making the elections in Korea similar to the previous elections in Greece. He believed that such elections were neither free nor democratic. He said that the letter from U.S. representative Austin to UN Secretary-General Lie on the Korean issue indicated that the U.S. government proposed to hold elections in Korea and withdraw its troops after the establishment of a Korean national government. In other words, the U.S. government was determined to hold elections in Korea in the manner of Greece, under the cover of its armed forces, and it was expected that real abuses would be discovered in the elections.</p>
<h3>U.S. Indicates Willingness to Use Force to Prevent Aggression Against Greece, Soviets Oppose Establishment of Balkan Observer Group</h3>
<p>[United Press, Flushing, 21st] U.S. representative Johnson delivered a broadcast speech today, dismissing Soviet attacks on U.S. plans for Greece and Korea and warning that the United States may use force to protect Greece. Johnson said, "If the Balkan cohorts of the Soviet Union persist in aggression against Greece, the United States will be prepared to cooperate with other countries of the United Nations to implement any measures recommended by the General Assembly to defend Greece." Johnson did not explicitly discuss the use of military force, but another U.S. spokesperson said that Johnson meant to clarify this point when he made this statement. However, it was generally emphasized that if the United States uses military force, it must first cooperate with other countries and must first have the recommendation of the General Assembly, the passage of which requires a two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>Johnson also said that if an observer committee cannot be established, Greece will suffer more aggression as a result, and other countries will also suffer new aggression. Prior to Johnson's speech, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky flatly rejected the proposal to establish a Balkan "observer" committee at the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 20th] To prevent the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Observer Committee, Soviet representative Vyshinsky today urged the General Assembly to reject the results of the discussions of the General Assembly's Political Committee, pointing out that there was no sufficient evidence to prove that Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia had assisted the Greek anti-government forces. The establishment of the United Nations Balkan Observer Committee is contrary to the United Nations Charter and the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. The only way to restore peace in the Balkans is to force British and American military missions to withdraw from Greece immediately and establish a special committee to supervise American aid to Greece. Polish representative Lange then submitted the following resolution, stating, "The General Assembly, after reviewing the issue of threats to Greek political independence and territorial integrity, and the opinions expressed by the various delegations, recommends that all foreign troops withdraw from Greece immediately, and that all foreign military instructors and military experts be recalled from Greece immediately. The General Assembly also requests that the governments concerned report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations no later than January 1, 1948 on the progress of the implementation of this recommendation." U.S. representative Johnson stated that if it is necessary to convene a special session of the General Assembly to review the threat to Greek political independence and territorial integrity, the U.S. government is prepared to cooperate with other member states of the United Nations to implement any measures recommended by the General Assembly to protect Greece. The purpose of the United States' policy toward Greece is only this, and there are no other motives, nor is it seeking material rewards. The specific issue at hand is to find a way to prevent aggression, and it is most appropriate to seek solutions to such issues with common strength. This is a challenge for the United Nations organization, and also an opportunity. The U.S. government will join other governments in meeting this challenge and improving this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Council Seat Still Deadlocked</h3>

<h3>Final Results of French Municipal Elections Announced, People's Rally Wins Big, Paris Transport Workers' Strike Ends Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] The vote counting work for the Paris municipal elections has now been completed. The French People's Rally led by General de Gaulle won 52 of the 90 seats on the City Council, the Communist Party won 25 seats, the Socialist Party 8 seats, and the Popular Republican Party 5 seats.

<h3>Harvey Succeeds British Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The Foreign Office announced the appointment of Sir Oliver Harvey, Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as the British Ambassador to Paris, succeeding the outgoing Ambassador Duff Cooper. Duff Cooper's departure is closely related to the pressure from Labour Party members to remove this well-known Conservative diplomat. The current change of British Ambassador to France is of particular significance, as the conflict between the French Communist Party and anti-communist factions will become increasingly apparent as a result of this municipal election. The British Embassy in Paris is the most suitable place to observe the political dynamics of Europe.</p>

<p>[Reuters, St. Louis, Missouri, 20th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Bruce addressed the National Foreign Trade Convention here, stating that although the amount of U.S. exports has reached an unprecedented high record, it is still slightly low compared with the sharp increase in production.

At this point, Mr. Romulo criticized the Security Council's "favoritism" towards the Netherlands as inappropriate. He urged the United Nations to take action to deal with the Netherlands' disobedience.</p>

McKittrick, vice chairman of the New York Chase Bank, said that the Marshall Plan must ensure that its aid is used to achieve full production, stable prices, stable currencies, and average wages. Sir Inverchapel, the British Ambassador to the United States, said that relief in the form of loans, subsidies, etc. in the Western Hemisphere is a symptomatic rather than a root cause solution.</p>

<h3>Most Silk Weaving Factories Go on Strike, Evaluation Committee Strictly Orders Resumption, Resolution of Disputes Should Be Complied With</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In Shanghai East, Shanghai West, and the 43rd District of this city, more than 400 silk weaving factories have largely gone on strike since yesterday. More than 200 factory representatives</p>
<p>went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition around 3:30 PM, sending representatives Yao Xintao, Qian Xubao, Liu Qingyi, and others to meet with Director Wu. Because yesterday was the 14th regular meeting of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, Secretary-General Yan Esheng of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting on behalf of Xu Guangji from the Social Affairs Bureau. Yan asked the representatives of the petitioners to explain the situation. The emotions of the factory owners were very激昂. In May of this year, due to the poor business conditions of the silk weaving industry and the inability to bear high</p>
<p>labor costs, they requested a reduction in wages. After the 13th meeting of the Evaluation Committee ruled to reduce wages, labor disputes such as strikes and slow work occurred, and the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation was ineffective. Subsequently,</p>
<p>the electricity and tramway strikes occurred in this city. To stabilize production and cope with the emergency situation, the Evaluation Committee drew up another</p>
<p>eight-item solution and ordered both parties to comply. Therefore, the employers believe that the emergency situation of the labor strike no longer exists, and the business difficulties of the silk weaving industry remain the same. They have no ability to implement the eight-item solution in the second instruction of the Evaluation Committee and demand remedies. Chang Jing Bao Esheng promised to put this opinion to the evaluation committee,</p>
<p>and the representatives of the factories withdrew to listen to the results of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Committee Holds 14th Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee of this city held</p>
<p>its 14th meeting yesterday, chaired by Director Wu Kaixian, to discuss the following important cases:</p>
<p>The wage dispute in the silk weaving industry was previously adjudicated by this committee. Subsequently, disputes arose between labor and management. To deal with the situation, this committee considered and determined</p>
<p>eight solutions and issued instructions for compliance, requesting ratification. Resolution: A. Labor and management may not apply for disagreement with the evaluation methods, as clearly stipulated by the Labor-Management Evaluation. This time, the labor and management of the industry</p>
<p>expressed objections to the evaluation methods of the 13th meeting of this committee, which is inappropriate. Since the Director of this committee has taken emergency measures to consider the emotions of both parties, this committee should ratify it. However, this method is provisionally allowed to be implemented for four months. The factories that went on strike yesterday should strictly order the labor to resume production immediately. B. If some factories cannot bear the above methods, both parties may formulate their own methods.</p>
<p>Case of employer in the leather shoe industry requesting wage reduction</p>
<p>, after discussion, considering that the industry's situation has improved, it is temporarily not allowed.</p>
<p>Method for factories to dismiss workers with indefinite contracts and pay severance pay, Resolution: A. If the factory is operating at a loss or is indeed unable to maintain operations, as verified by the competent authority, the severance pay may be reduced by this committee. B. Seasonal factories that cannot operate year-round, their shutdown should not be regarded as dismissal. C. Violations of factory regulations that have been submitted to the competent authority for approval, with confirmed evidence, are allowed to be dismissed without severance pay.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of Workers' Holidays for Two Public Utility Companies</h3>

<p>methods agreed upon by labor and management,</p>
<p>and implemented,</p>
<p>which are not easy to change, follow</p>
<p>the original methods. If there is no</p>
<p>agreement and disputes arise, refer to the regulations of general public utility companies in this city.

<h3>Labor Union Calls for General Meeting, Question of Continued Wages</h3>
<p>Labor</p>
<p>union calls</p>
<p>member</p>
<p>meeting, case of employer still paying wages. Resolution</p>
<p>: A. All factories, companies, and firms that have holidays stipulated by the Factory</p>
<p>Law or agreed upon, the labor union should hold member or representative meetings on statutory holidays. B. All factories, companies, and firms without fixed holidays should be allowed to take leave and pay wages when the labor union holds member or representative meetings, but the meeting period should be limited to what is stipulated in the labor union's constitution</p>
<p>and approved by the competent authority. If elected as a representative to the city labor union, city general labor union, national general labor union, or the national federation of the industry, the vacation period should be approved by the employer based on the actual situation. C. Factories, companies, and firms with fixed holidays that normally work on general holidays and add overtime wages, labor</p>
<p>should be allowed to take leave but not pay overtime wages when holding member or representative meetings. D. Labor union</p>
<p>memberships under 300 people may apply in advance to the competent authority to hold member meetings.</p>
<p>Those with more than 300 people should hold representative</p>
<p>meetings to avoid affecting production. E. The labor union</p>
<p>should send the list of attending representatives to the employer three days in advance when holding a representative meeting. F. If a member or representative of the labor union</p>
<p>has been granted leave by the employer to attend the member general meeting or representative</p>
<p>meeting, and is absent without reason during the meeting, the labor union should send</p>
<p>the list to the employer to deduct wages.</p>
<h3>Water Company Requests Price Increase, Public Utilities Bureau Temporarily Does Not Consider</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The prices of public utilities such as electricity, telephone,</p>
<p>gas, tramway, bus, ferry,</p>
<p>and small train in this city have been adjusted since yesterday. Only the water price was not adjusted this time,</p>
<p>because it had been adjusted once in September, so it will temporarily maintain the original price. Now, the various water companies have negotiated with the Public Utilities Bureau when adjusting in September that if</p>
<p>the price increases by 10%, they should still be allowed to increase prices.</p>
<p>Now, the price increase has long exceeded 10%, and the various companies have reported losses. Therefore, they requested the</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau to approve another adjustment to more than 4,000 yuan per cubic meter. (The current price for British and French companies is 2,500 yuan per cubic meter.</p>
<p>The price for Zhabei, Inland, and Pudong companies is 2,900 yuan per cubic meter). According to Director Zhao, regarding the water company's request for a price increase,</p>
<p>it will not be considered this month and will be discussed again next month.</p>
<h3>Strengthen Economic Police, Economic Section Plans to Become Independent</h3>
<p>"Report from this newspaper"</p>
<p>The police bureau is preparing to strengthen economic</p>
<p>police work by making the current economic section independent.</p>
<p>This organizational plan was</p>
<p>completed yesterday by the administrative director</p>
<p>and can be realized after approval. The section</p>
<p>will have five units: finance, food, yarn, fuel, and</p>
<p>military daily necessities, and plans to place the original</p>
<p>economic police brigade under the jurisdiction of the section. However,</p>
<p>it will still maintain contact with the various groups under the Economic Inspection Association during work.</p>
<h3>Frugal Banquets Cause Restaurant Cries, Chinese and Western Restaurants Experience Sharp Business Decline, Private Kitchens Emerge</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the implementation of banquet frugality on the 20th, Chinese and Western</p>
<p>restaurants have mostly been able to comply. Small restaurants are less affected by frugality,</p>
<p>but larger Chinese and Western restaurants have experienced a sharp decline in business, and are all complaining. For example,</p>
<p>Fengzelou's business has declined by almost half. Therefore, some restaurants feel that future business will be difficult due to reduced income. According to Zhou Dunxiang, executive director of the Restaurant Industry Association,</p>
<p>the restaurant industry generally agrees with and is willing to adhere to the principle of frugality, but the implementation of banquet frugality has indeed led to a sharp decline in the business of various restaurants. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>Because the restaurant's business has decreased, the income of waiters and tea</p>
<p>servers has also decreased. Larger</p>
<p>restaurants are particularly affected and almost feel unable to maintain operations.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to price restrictions and the prohibition of selling valuable seafood in restaurants,</p>
<p>some private kitchens have emerged, still selling various expensive</p>
<p>dishes at greatly increased prices. For example, a portion of shark fin, which originally sold for 60,000 yuan in restaurants, now costs as much as</p>
<p>120,000 yuan. Now the regulation of six dishes and one soup</p>
<p>is priced at a maximum of 1.2 million yuan. In fact, the original</p>
<p>1.2 million yuan dishes are definitely more than six dishes and one soup.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people who originally planned banquets have declined. Now, due to the implementation of frugality regulations,</p>
<p>many seafood chefs are no longer needed, which inevitably leads to unemployment. Moreover, wealthy households can still buy expensive seafood</p>
<p>and cook it themselves. They will definitely not be frugal because restaurants do not</p>
<p>sell them. This will only lead to higher seafood prices. The restaurant industry believes that in this extraordinary period,</p>
<p>frugality should be the norm, but hopes that the regulations can be slightly more flexible so that the restaurant industry</p>
<p>can maintain its business.</p>
<h3>Fourth General Assembly of the Senate, Resumption Scheduled for the 31st</h3>
<p>"Report from this newspaper"</p>
<p>The Fourth General Assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Senate</p>
<p>will continue</p>
<p>its meeting on the</p>
<p>31st of this month.</p>
<p>The agenda has been</p>
<p>set for the 31st</p>
<p>from 9:00 AM to</p>
<p>12:00 PM, the eighth</p>
<p>meeting to discuss proposals, from 3:00 PM to</p>
<p>7:00 PM, the ninth meeting to discuss proposals. November 1st, from 9:00 AM</p>
<p>to 12:00 PM, the tenth meeting to discuss proposals, from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the eleventh</p>
<p>meeting to discuss proposals, and then hold</p>
<p>the closing ceremony.</p>
<h3>Explaining Two Points to Reporters</h3>
<p>"Also Reported" The restaurant industry, due to the</p>
<p>price limit</p>
<p>method for banquets, caused the outside world to misunderstand because the maximum amount exceeded</p>
<p>the general market price, especially since the prices are high. Therefore, they specially invited the press yesterday to</p>
<p>explain two points: The price limit is limited upwards but not downwards.</p>
<p>For example, the banquet is set at a maximum of 1.2 million,</p>
<p>a minimum of 600,000; however, small and medium-sized restaurants are willing to sell at low prices</p>
<p>of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, or economic meals are willing to sell for</p>
<p>less than 10,000 yuan, they are still free to do so.</p>
<p>Although the items in the frugal banquets have been reduced, the quantity still maintains</p>
<p>a certain standard, enough to satisfy the appetite of ten people at a table.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Sun and Mrs. Chiang Visit Book Exhibition Together</h3>
<p>Chen Shuren's exhibition officially opened yesterday,</p>
<p>and visitors were very enthusiastic. Mrs. Sun Yat-sen,</p>
<p>Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, also went together to visit yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek also ordered two paintings, "Wucheng Spring Colors" and "Baimen Willow Colors."</p>
<p>Other guests ordered as many as seventy or eighty paintings.</p>
<h3>Redeeming Land Illegally Acquired, Gold Price Calculation Breakthrough, Clearing Office Responds to Tao Derong Case</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Senate previously received a petition from citizen Tao Derong stating that his land located in the Yinxiang District</p>
<p>was forcibly acquired by the enemy and puppets during the occupation, requesting prompt return to alleviate the people's difficulties,</p>
<p>which was forwarded to the Central Trust Bureau for investigation. The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Central Trust Bureau replied: The case has been decided by the 10th meeting of the small group committee for handling enemy and puppet requisitioned and acquired land, organized jointly by the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau,</p>
<p>to allow the original price received from the enemy and puppets to be calculated based on the market price of gold,</p>
<p>and ordered the applicant to pay the money and take it back. Once the pricing procedures are completed, Tao Derong will be notified to handle it.</p>
<p>It is still a novel idea to redeem land forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets based on the market price of gold.</p>
<h3>2 Trillion Yuan of Capital, Frozen Intangibly, Car Ownership Transfer Suspended, Municipal Senators Object</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Municipal</p>
<p>Senators Tao Baichuan, Zhang Yiqu,</p>
<p>Zhang Naizuo, Yang Minghui,</p>
<p>Qu Yue, etc., believe that the Public Utilities</p>
<p>Bureau of this city suspended car</p>
<p>ownership transfers on the 14th of this month, which is detrimental</p>
<p>to the people. They sent a letter to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, stating</p>
<p>the reasons why this method should be canceled.</p>
<p>The main purpose</p>
<p>of the central government's restriction on private car use</p>
<p>is to strictly regulate</p>
<p>the qualifications for new</p>
<p>registration applications and to phase out</p>
<p>old cars to complete</p>
<p>the conservation work. The original method does not</p>
<p>expressly stipulate the suspension of car ownership transfers, because car ownership transfers</p>
<p>are transfers of ownership, not an increase in vehicles, which does not conflict with the restriction method,</p>
<p>and has absolutely no effect on the original intention of conservation. Moreover, old cars are one of the citizens'</p>
<p>movable assets, and the government should provide reasonable protection. According to the Municipal Government's policy report,</p>
<p>as of March of this year, there were 22,625 motorized vehicles registered with the Public Utilities Bureau. Assuming that the average price of each vehicle</p>
<p>is 100 million yuan, if car ownership transfers are suspended, then the citizens'</p>
<p>capital will be frozen intangibly at more than 2 trillion yuan. Think about the losses of the citizens.</p>
<p>The essence of conservation is to enrich the people, not to harm them.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Public Utilities Bureau is to benefit the people, not to harm them.</p>
<p>This kind of unilateral regulation has not been reviewed by the Senate. How can it be implemented without authorization before the Municipal Government announces it?</p>
<p>We have prepared a letter to report the situation, and we respectfully ask for your decision. We urge you to immediately consult the Municipal Government</p>
<p>and order the Public Utilities Bureau to promptly cancel the car ownership transfer suspension method</p>
<p>to benefit the citizens."</p>
<h3>Director Zhao Talks About Car Conservation, First Step is to Prevent Wasteful Design Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The car conservation in this city is currently being carefully studied and formulated by the Public Utilities Bureau, inviting relevant agencies.</p>
<p>It is planned to submit it to the municipal government meeting for approval this month and implement it from next month. According to Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao</p>
<p>Huijue, who told reporters yesterday: The principle of the implementation method is that the first</p>
<p>step is to prevent waste. Those who own more than one vehicle will be reduced first.</p>
<p>In order to prevent them from registering under multiple names, the Public Utilities Bureau is checking the registration</p>
<p>forms. If several cars belong to one owner, they will still be reduced. The second step is to eliminate non-essential vehicles in batches by lottery. The implementation method needs to be implemented step by step.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will be unfair if those who own several vehicles are not eliminated, while those who only own one</p>
<p>are selected. Therefore, the lottery elimination system is not implemented first. As for the standards for those who are qualified to use cars, in addition to</p>
<p>agencies, banks, factories, and businesses related to people's livelihood, etc., the central government only stipulates</p>
<p>doctors. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. Lawyers, technicians, accountants, etc. also need to use cars in their work. Therefore,</p>
<p>the implementation rules being formulated will supplement the standards set by the central government. In short, there are many cars in this city, and it is very troublesome to implement conservation.</p>
<p>In order to prevent loopholes, we do not demand details when formulating the implementation rules</p>
<p>in order to seek perfection.</p>

<h3>Relocated Sichuan-Guizhou Factories United Association Suggests Four Points on Applying for Price-Matched Compensation Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Relocated Sichuan-Guizhou</p>
<p>Factories United Association held</p>
<p>a temporary meeting of members in Shanghai</p>
<p>yesterday at the Dagon Vocational School on Emei Road.</p>
<p>First, Hu Juewen, the executive director of the association, reported on the association's affairs.</p>
<p>Then, the entire meeting passed</p>
<p>four points of advice to the Executive Yuan on "Applying for Japanese</p>
<p>Compensation Materials at Matched Prices":</p>
<p>The price matching of Japanese compensation materials</p>
<p>should be based on the degree of damage and contribution of each factory during the war, and should not focus on national treasury</p>
<p>revenue. Those businesses that were relocated inland during the war and are still in the rear should have separate laws and regulations to give them preference.</p>
<p>The scope of allocation should be based on the ratio of losses between public and private enterprises, and should not be biased. The internal relocated factories should be given priority in the allocation and given the largest quota, followed by the new</p>
<p>factories during the war, and finally the factories that have not been relocated inland can be allocated. The management methods after allocation can be entrusted to relevant industrial and commercial groups to formulate themselves. Whether it is cooperative management or joint management, many disputes can be avoided. Regarding the point that each factory should assist the authorities in studying the Japanese compensation issue, the association has launched a representative to conduct research together with the representatives of the Hunan-Guizhou factories.</p>

<p>consulted Jiang Beiqing, the landlord of Guanlong, Lane 136, Kunshan Road, requesting that Jiang open the iron gate of the lane</p>
<p>so they could call for classmates from the dormitory next to the fence to open the school gates. Jiang refused, citing that Yuan and others had not interacted with him much before, leaving Yuan and others without options. When a tenant of the lane returned home, Qin Minliang</p>

<p>In mid-May of this year, Xie Aifu went to the Jinshan Hotel to visit his cousin He Dianqi, the former county magistrate of Fengxian who had come to Shanghai. At He's residence, he met Chen Delai from Shengxian. The two became acquainted quickly, and during their conversation, Chen suddenly told Xie that the Star Grand Theater, which specialized in Yue Opera, often privately forged stamp tax tickets to evade taxes and should be reported. Xie immediately said that it would be easy, as he had an acquaintance at the Tax Bureau who was a division chief and could be informed.</p>
<p>On May 19, they invited Chen Shunhua and</p>
<p>Ding Jiachang to the Star Grand Theater for inspection, and several forged</p>
<p>tickets were found. Chen Xing and Chen Yixin, employees of the theater,</p>

<p>"Since I was the one who confidentially reported the matter, shouldn't there be a reward"? The report was made to the Direct Tax Bureau,</p>

<p>to engage in archaeological work, lasting over three months. He has returned to Guanzhong (Shaanxi) before. Pei's</p>
<p>work in Gansu this time was limited by funds, so he only accompanied Mi Taiheng, a technician from the Northwest Branch of the Central Geological Survey,</p>
<p>and brought a small number of workers to work in the field. Wang Yongyan, a researcher at the Science Education Center, who</p>
<p>gained fame in China for discovering "Wudu Yuanren" (Wudu Man), also participated in the work in the Wei River basin. In August, Wang went to Wudu specifically</p>
<p>to continue collecting fossilized bones and also collected over three thousand pieces, returning to Lanzhou before. Pei</p>
<p>originally planned to go to Wudu for inspection, but later, considering the importance of work in the Tao River basin, changed</p>
<p>his original plan and did not go to Wudu. Pei collected a total of twelve</p>
<p>boxes of data this time, mostly pottery shards, stone tools, and other valuable</p>
<p>materials related to ancient human culture, from which</p>
<p>the activities of ancient humans in the upper reaches of the Yellow River can be traced.</p>
<p>Andersson Divides into Six Periods</p>
<p>According to Pei</p>
<p>told reporters</p>
<p>: The Swede</p>
<p>Andersson,</p>
<p>(J.G.Anderson), used to come to</p>
<p>Gansu and Qinghai to engage in archaeology. He divided</p>
<p>Chinese culture into six periods based on the painted pottery he discovered: "Qijia"</p>
<p>(this period is approximately 2,000 years before the Western calendar), "Yangshao" (this period is also known as Fengshan Period, which is the end of the Neolithic Age and connects with</p>
<p>the Copper Age), "Machang," "Xindian," "Siwa," "Shajing" (this period is approximately 500 years before the Christian era, during the Han Dynasty of China). After Anderson's thesis was published,</p>
<p>the academic community was skeptical of his "Qijia" period. Pei specifically</p>
<p>went to the Qijiaping area of Lintao for inspection and discovered ancient</p>
<p>human dwellings, proving that Andersson's theory had a basis.</p>
<p>Before the Han Dynasty There Were Lime Walls</p>
<p>However, according to</p>
<p>Pei,</p>
<p>"The Qijia"</p>
<p>period does not</p>
<p>seem to be the earliest, because judging from the utensils in the cliff dwelling, such as the "Li" (three-legged pottery) and the glass beads worn by women's skulls, they were definitely not</p>
<p>prehistoric humans, but there is no doubt that they were before the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Pei continued: "According to our historical records,</p>
<p>humans before the Han Dynasty did not live in buildings,</p>
<p>and this building already has lime walls, which is also</p>
<p>something that predecessors had not discovered. This can strengthen</p>
<p>our understanding of ancient cultural research."</p>
<p>Important Discovery in Academia</p>
<p>Regarding the</p>
<p>origin of Chinese</p>
<p>culture,</p>
<p>in the past, the academic</p>
<p>community only hypothesized that it originated from the Tao River and passed through the Wei River</p>
<p>basin, through Guanzhong (Shaanxi), before connecting with the Yellow River</p>
<p>basin to reach the Henan Plain. This was just speculation, and no archaeologist had</p>
<p>conducted an on-site inspection in the Wei River basin. Pei discovered a lot of painted pottery in the Wei</p>
<p>River basin this time, and the area where it was distributed was very wide, confirming that the culture of the Tao River and the Yellow River</p>
<p>basin was indeed connected to the Wei River basin. This is Pei's most important discovery and also</p>
<p>the most academically valuable harvest.</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Large-Scale Excavation</p>
<p>Pei last</p>
<p>night accepted</p>
<p>the invitation of</p>
<p>Xin Shuzhi,</p>
<p>the president of Lanzhou University,</p>
<p>and spoke the above words in the auditorium of the university. Today (the 18th), at the invitation of members of the Lanzhou Branch of the Geological Society of China,</p>
<p>he lectured on geological issues. According to Pei, this</p>
<p>is only the beginning of the work. He will take the twelve</p>
<p>boxes of materials he obtained back to Beiping soon to organize and study these materials. Next year, he will raise a large amount</p>
<p>of funds and invite famous Chinese archaeologists</p>
<p>and geologists to come to Gansu again to continue</p>
<p>the work of large-scale excavation. (Correspondent</p>

Recently, due to the inability to maintain operations, they have appealed to all parties, campaigned, and held meetings. After repeated discussions, it has been decided to implement a second increase: 110,000 yuan for primary grades, 130,000 yuan for middle grades, and 150,000 yuan for upper grades, effective from the 21st of this month. However, people in society have complained about the two fee increases.</p>
<h3>Children's Library Adds Circulation Station</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] Since Fang Shayang took over as the new chairman of the Shanghai Children's Library, in addition to finding ways to promote the original reading activities, the mobile library van has resumed its rounds since September 25th. The first circulation station was established in the Huxi Commune on Changshou Road.

<h3>Hong Kong Football News: Kitchee Leads the Pack, Winning Against Chinese and South China; Star Island's Five Tigers Return to Hong Kong to Assist Chen</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Hong Kong Office] Football matches happen every year, but this year there are especially many, making one weary of watching them day after day. On Saturday the 11th, the First Division's Kitchee faced South China. The situation was one-sided, with Kitchee emerging as a dark horse. South China is not what it used to be, and Kitchee won decisively with a score of 5-1. The old and incapable South China was defeated by the rising Kitchee, which was to be expected. Despite fielding strong players such as Chen Dehui, Liang Rongzhao, and Liu Rongguang, the fighter Zhu Rongguang was too immature, leading to South China's crushing defeat. By halftime, they were already down 3-1, and they conceded two more goals in the second half, ending the game at 5-1.</p>
<p>South China Dominates; Fifteen Teams Participate in This Year's League</p>
<p>Apart from Star Island, which has yet to make an appearance, only Kitchee and Chinese have been consistently victorious. These two winning teams will clash this Thursday (the 16th). Star Island's second batch of players will arrive in Hong Kong around the 16th. This year, foreign players are largely ineffective, and the football scene will be dominated by Chinese players. The current league standings are as follows (as of October 12th):</p>
<p>Another Victory Against Chinese; The Most Exciting Match on Thursday the 16th</p>
<p>The two winning teams of the Chinese squad will clash. Kitchee is making every effort to beat Chinese. With the addition of five players from Star Island, Kitchee's attraction is even greater. Before 5 o'clock, the Naval Ground was already packed. Those who arrived late could only sigh at the gate. As the time arrived, the twenty-two warriors lined up on both sides:</p>
<p>Kitchee Team:</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Zheng Ying, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Zhen, Song Lingsheng, Liu Qingcai</p>
<p>Huang Jingzong, Li Zhaorong, Guo Yingqi, Li Dianqi, He Yingfen</p>
<p>Chinese Team:</p>
<p>Yu Qien</p>
<p>Li Guowei, He Jiaqiang</p>
<p>Chen Jinzhao, Kong Qingyu, He Youji</p>
<p>Liang Bingkun, Li Chunfa, Miao Changrong, Guo Zhuochang, Li Dahui</p>
<p>As a result of the great battle, Kitchee overwhelmed Chinese with a score of 5-1, demonstrating a clear difference in skill. Besides being technically inferior, Chinese's defeat was also due to strategic errors and excessive aggression.</p>
<p>Throughout the match, Chinese focused its energy on attacking in the first half. Therefore, although they managed to score and make it 2-1 in the first half, they conceded three goals in the second half. Their strength was inferior, which was not their fault.</p>
<p>In contrast, Kitchee relied entirely on experience and skill to suppress their opponents' reckless movements. Therefore, their victory was not strenuous. Both teams had good defenders, but Chinese's forwards were too scattered.</p>
<p>Of the five players who trained in England, Zhaoheng and Rongsheng did not show significant improvement. Yuanfen, Zhaorong, and Lingsheng had better performances. They pass as soon as they receive the ball and shoot when they see an opportunity, which are their new skills.</p>
<p>Scoring Sequence: In the first half, Zhaorong demonstrated his skills, and Chinese's Chunfa equalized, making it 1-1. Yingqi scored, making it 2-1, with Kitchee taking the lead. In the second half, Yingqi scored one goal and Zhaorong scored two, while Chinese scored none. Kitchee temporarily retains the winning record.</p>

<h3>News Kills</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>No one can deny that newspapers have the mission of promoting social progress. Based on this reason, the exposure of news by newspapers really needs to be discreet. The distribution of news by news agencies should also consider its impact after publication.</p>
<p>Recently, a news-killing incident happened in Hankou. According to the Shanghai News Hankou's 8th dispatch: Asia News Agency released a news about a woman, Zhang Anhua's, immorality, causing Ms. Zhang to commit suicide by jumping into the river.</p>
<p>Originally, a woman's immorality is a private matter, and even if she remarries, it is not a big deal. (It is not my intention to defend the deceased; it is just the fact.) Such personal matter should not occupy the precious space of the newspaper. The personality and responsibility of journalists themselves should be absolutely considered, and should never circle around personal matters, taking the exposure of some personal secrets as a skill, and using these "gimmicks" as a way to attract readers. Journalists, lawyers, and doctors have been regarded as the three biggest scoundrels (?). This is definitely not the honor of journalists. In fact, the pen of a journalist may be regarded as a bad thing; only through noble personality and full sense of justice, journalists are useful and meritorious to the society, can they be respected by all levels of society, the news under his pen is the news that promotes social progress, and the impact after publication will not be "killing".</p>
<h3>Rambling Talk on the Double Ninth Festival</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>Alone in a foreign land, I am a stranger,</p>
<p>Every festive season doubles my longing for family.</p>
<p>From afar, I know my brothers</p>
<p>Are climbing to the heights today,</p>
<p>With dogwood sprigs for all but one.</p>
<p>As a guest in a foreign land, encountering the Double Ninth Festival again, recalling Wang Wei's famous lines, how can one not feel sorrow!</p>
<p>Among the seasonal festivals, the ones that most stir memories of family and home are the Double Ninth and New Year's Eve. The origin of Double Ninth banquets is unknown, but it seems that this custom began in the Han Dynasty, starting with Fei Changfang telling Huan Jing on the ninth day of the ninth month to have his family sew pouches, fill them with dogwood, tie them to their arms, and climb mountains to drink chrysanthemum wine to ward off misfortune. In terms of preserving national essence, northerners are stronger than southerners. Despite the war, northerners still maintain the elegant tradition of Double Ninth mountain climbing, while southerners merely eat a few Double Ninth cakes from tea shops, and the custom of mountain climbing has largely disappeared.</p>
<p>In the north, on the Double Ninth Festival, in addition to bringing wine sets, tea stoves, and food boxes for mountain climbing picnics, they also make steamed cakes embedded with dates. The parents of daughters who have married must welcome them back home the day before for a joyous reunion. The Double Ninth Festival in the north is also known as the Daughters' Day. Children fly kites for amusement. Southerners are noticeably more indifferent to the Double Ninth.</p>
<p>"A rainless Double Ninth means a sunny winter," this farmer's saying is quite accurate. Many say that if the Double Ninth is clear, then the Winter Solstice, New Year's Day, Lantern Festival, and Qingming Festival will also be clear, but rainy weather will mean rain for all. This is probably not accurate.</p>
<p>Among Double Ninth poems, I love Cen Shen's the most: "I strongly desire to climb high, but no one brings wine to me. The chrysanthemums in my old garden, it seems, are blooming beside the battlefield."</p>
<p>This poem best suits the situation of many people today. How many people would bring wine to the reclusive Tao Pengze? With war raging, the chrysanthemums in one's old garden have probably all bloomed beside the battlefield.</p>
<p>Zhu Fang's: "I wanted to go climbing hand in hand, but once at the door, the desire was gone. How can I take the hair on my head and learn from the young to wear dogwood?" This poem also fits the thoughts of people today. With black hair turning white, what mood is left to insert seasonal dogwood?</p>
<p>Riding horses and shooting arrows were among the eight skills that people in ancient times must learn. Xiao Yu, Duke of Song in the Tang Dynasty, was granted the opportunity to shoot arrows on the ninth day of the ninth month, but none of his arrows hit the target. Ouyang Xun mocked him saying, "Thinking that the wind blows the arrows slowly, weak hands control a strong bow. Wanting to go high, they repeatedly fall down, and should go west to return to the east. Ten times they fall to the ground, both hands hold them up high. Asking who is doing this in leisure, it must be the Duke of Song." The strength of the Tang Dynasty was due to the martial customs. By the Song Dynasty, scholars like Xiao Yu were probably not unusual.</p>
<p>Tang Dynasty people wrote many poems about the Double Ninth Festival, but none mentioned cake. Liu Yuxi wanted to use the word "cake" in his Double Ninth poem, but stopped when he realized that the word was not found in the Six Classics. By the time of Song Zijing, he boldly wrote, "The rustling wind blows against my light robe, I share food and chrysanthemum wine in groups. Liu Lang didn't bother to inscribe the word 'cake,' failing his reputation as a hero in poetry." Tang Dynasty poems emphasized refinement, while Song poems emphasized boldness. Liu Yuxi's not inscribing the word "cake" was his prudence, not a weakness.</p>
<p>Zhao Changqing's "Nan Ge Zi" song on the Double Ninth on the Road says, "What day is this? In a foreign land, I remember my homeland. Passing the Double Ninth in the depths of the mountains, galloping on horseback through the blooming flowers, with no youthful exuberance left"; "The yellow chrysanthemums hold heavy branches, the red sorrel is fragrant with dew. A small boat follows the geese across the Xiangjiang River, imagining my family's courtyard, regretting not sharing the wine."</p>
<p>Last year on this day, heading east from Guiyang, in the depths of the mountains, I drank a cup of turbid wine in a village along the road. Recalling the youthful exuberance of climbing mountains and drinking wine, I couldn't help but feel disheartened!</p>
<h3>Small Chongyang Mountain</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Double Ninth</p>
<p>Once again, I see the beautiful fragrance of yellow flowers, year after year cherishing vain hopes to avoid disasters! Rice prices are frightening, sugar is terrifying, how many people taste the cake?</p>
<p>Refugees are everywhere, dogwood has fallen, no longer effective! The future is filled with mad scientific warfare, where to escape? The ghosts cry for Fei Changfang!</p>
<h3>Nanjing City -- Just How Big Is It?</h3>
<p>— Lin Mei</p>
<p>Every citizen of the Republic of China should have a thorough understanding of their capital. Based on this principle, let's test your knowledge: How big is Nanjing City?</p>
<p>I've posed this question now, and I can guarantee as an insurance company that 99 out of 100 citizens of the Republic of China don't know the answer. These 99 citizens who don't know the answer have no choice but to consult a map. Right now, I'm one of those 99 citizens, and I'll record the results of my map consultation below:</p>
<p>The "New Map of China" published by Zhenbing and Dishe, edited by Shi Zhonghua, third revised edition in October of the 35th year (1946), states that the circumference of Nanjing City is 34 kilometers.</p>
<p>The "New People's China Map" published by the Xinmin Geography Society, edited by Xu Tuizhi, issued in September of the 35th year (1946), states that the circumference of Nanjing City is 47 kilometers.</p>
<p>The "Geography Textbook Map for Middle Schools" published by the Chinese Historical and Geographical Map Compilation Society, published in December of the 35th year (1946), states that the circumference of Nanjing City is 55 kilometers.</p>
<p>I don't have enough money to buy other maps to consult. Which of these three maps should we rely on? Let's think about how much a person can walk in a day. According to these three maps, the smallest differs from the largest by 21 kilometers, which means the smallest is almost one-third less than the largest. How long would it take an ordinary person to walk that one-third less?</p>
<p>Assuming I'm a student, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education's entrance examination, I can't object and have to take the exam. If the teacher asks a question like the one I've posed, I don't know which map the teacher uses as the standard. Even if I answer with a certain number of kilometers or two different answers, will I pass? It's as uncertain as winning the lottery.</p>
<h3>Talking About Climbing High</h3>
<p>— Ding Rongguan</p>
<p>In order to avoid disaster, Fei Changfang listened to the advice of Lord Hu, and on the day of the ninth day of the ninth month, he took his family up the mountain, and as a result, they escaped the catastrophe. Thus, he opened the custom of ascending high on the Double Ninth in later generations.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a similar record can also be found in the Christian Bible. One is that Jesus foretold the days of the end times, and he instructed, "Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains." (Matthew 24). The second is that the Old Testament records that an angel rescued Lot's family and also exhorted, "Escape for your life! Do not look back, nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be swept away." (Genesis 19). Choosing the mountains to escape disaster also has a factual basis in the modern scientific wars of the twentieth century: This is because the hilly areas are high in terrain, and the damage from poisonous gas, epidemics, artillery fire, and bombs is naturally lighter than in the plains. Being high up is also more advantageous for observation than being on the plains. We can imagine that in the future, with rocket artillery and atomic warfare with particularly strong destructive power, if air-raid shelters completely lose their protection, the only reliable place is the mountains, which are relatively likely to be spared. Recently, the Soviet Union's distribution of industrial centers has been chosen in the Ural Mountains area of ​​the rear of Asia, and its intention is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Not only that, even in normal times, even if it is not for choosing to be difficult, mountain climbing can also have a great effect. In the past, Confucius ascended Mount Tai and looked down on the world. Climbing high can increase our horizons. As the saying goes, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and a high tower rises from a foundation of earth." As the poem says, "If you want to see a thousand miles further, climb to a higher floor." As a person, one must have knowledge. Climbing high not only broadens our minds, but also helps our health. In the autumn, the weather is clear and refreshing, which is a good opportunity for outings. At that time, a family can have a meal together on the mountain. Even if it is not for avoiding disaster, it will not lose its pleasure. I think the ancients created festivals and customs, and their intention was also here.</p>
<h3>Eggs in England</h3>
<p>— Zhong Li</p>
<p>A country old baronet in London sent an old friend a present of congratulation not long after his first grandson was born—a small wooden box—with "Handle with Care" written on it.</p>
<p>At first everyone thought it was an ancient glass instrument. When they opened it, it turned out to be two eggs sleeping on cotton. This large gift simply astonished all the guests. Even the 72 year old baronet was grateful and his tears flowed. The result was that he exchanged it for three months of food, flour and potatoes etc.</p>
<p>Ordinary people can buy the "egg powder" of two eggs per month on the government’s "ration coupon". There are no fresh eggs.</p>
<p>There are many people in England who "don't know the taste of eggs in March". Even if there are fresh eggs, the hostess doesn't know how to use them.</p>
<p>It is said that a person who feared living in London and who was recently sent to Italy discovered there that fresh eggs were so abundant that he was frightened. He embraced the principle of "eat eggs when hungry." On the eve of his return trip, he ate seventeen eggs in one go and then patted his stomach and said: "Haha, I have accumulated more than eight months of eggs in my stomach."</p>
<p>Recently, the British government has reduced the "egg powder" ration a little. The people have been complaining about it. The most vehement opposition comes from a film company. They put an egg in a box and put a garden on top of it to hold a memorial service and filmed it in the film and shown it everywhere.</p>
<p>Not only is it difficult for the British to get eggs in their own country, but it is also the case for the envoys of various countries stationed in England. Once, an ambassador of a certain country wanted to enjoy a meal of poached eggs, so he wrote an official letter to the British Foreign Office requesting an allotment of egg powder for five eggs. As a result, this letter was forwarded from the Foreign Office to the Home Office and from the Home Office to the Ministry of Food. After circling around for half a month, it was approved by the Ministry of Food, authorizing the purchase of one fresh egg. Two weeks later, the Ministry of Food sent a special messenger to deliver the egg and requested a formal receipt. After receiving the egg, the ambassador loved it more and more and couldn't bear to eat it. So he took a glass fork and put it in it. It was placed on the desk, and the guests all admired it.</p>
<p>It is said that once a certain unit had issued war medals, but because there were more people than medals, it was decided that those who did not receive medals would be given an egg. Everyone scrambled for the eggs, so a lottery was held. Everyone who won an egg was triumphant, while those who did not quietly took the medals and walked away.</p>
<h3>Banyan City Autumn Writings</h3>
<p>— Lei</p>
<p>Autumn wind and falling leaves evoke sorrow, countless poets and writers, countless elders and young women with deep concerns, are stirred by this alluring season, moved by the slightest sound, casting off tears of longing for people, remembering distant places, and carrying affection and resentment. At the same time, there are also many wealthy gentlemen who feel that the autumn is clear and refreshing, which is a good time to climb high and look into the distance, travel in the mountains and rivers, and open their hearts. Some merchants and brokers, like awakened insects, realize that the long summer's off-season has passed, and quickly ring the abacus, re-dressing all kinds of lonely and dusty commodities with superb prices, squeezing into the market, revealing their faces.</p>
<p>Fuzhou, this tail-end port of South China, makes a steel bed equipped with springs feel very sensitive. Any small vibration will cause her inertia to work, just like a small ripple, constantly expanding its range, unless it is resisted and completely shattered, she will move forward endlessly. Although Fuzhou's prices rarely have the ability to spontaneously influence the surrounding area, she is indeed very easy to accept external influences. In this new opportunity of seasonal rotation, the Fuzhou market already has unlimited vitality and is preparing to burst forth vigorously.</p>
<h3>High Monk</h3>
<p>— Li Renzhong</p>
<p>In today's world where people hate each other with weapons and scheme for money and goods, suddenly a high monk, the Italian Luoganna Da, has come to Shanghai to promote Buddhism. Buddhism is a profound philosophy, so many ignorant men and women who believe in Buddhism often turn it into a Buddhism that is like putting a cow's head on a horse's body. Heresies are involved, turning into superstition.</p>
<p>The high monk has studied science. It is rare to find a monk with a scientific foundation. This scientific monk said that in order to reduce the fear of the atomic bomb, the following precepts must be observed: Do not kill. Do not take what is not rightfully yours. Do not defile another's wife. Do not lie. Do not get drunk.</p>
<p>Although the scientific monk can see through the root of the world's illness, can everyone in the world achieve these five precepts? As for "Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot," needless to say, it is still a "difficult" word!</p>
<p>Luoganna Da also said: If science can cooperate with Buddhist teachings, then science can truly seek happiness for mankind. Otherwise, it will destroy mankind! Every sentence is a warning bell, but this world is already terminally ill and deeply entrenched!</p>
<p>However, in this degenerate world, it is essential to have such a monk appear and try to help.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America's Entertainment</p>
<p>American women can be considered the happiest people in the world. They never worry needlessly, their minds are always broad, and their inner joy flows out of their appearance, so they always smile, and it is completely natural. If a Chinese Lin Daiyu, who is full of sorrow and sickness and has her eyebrows locked in sadness, forces herself to show her teeth when taking a photo, pretending to smile bitterly, it will definitely not add a bit of beauty. American women have many ways to entertain themselves. Girls under the age of seventeen are more restricted because they are controlled by their parents, but they can watch movies, participate in all family dance parties, and also have the privilege of participating in blanket parties. What is a Blanket Party? Take a blanket and go camping in the suburbs with your boyfriend for a night. It is a very strange and immoral social event. Nine out of ten girls will lose their virginity that night. They can openly socialize before they are seventeen, and their parents can no longer control them. She can find an object in the bar, in the general association, and in the playground. She can enter and leave hotels, or rent an apartment house separately, like a little bird just out of its cage, soaring all day long. In addition to the intoxicating bars and nightclubs, they also have various legitimate entertainment. They can swim, ride horses, and play tennis. There must be tennis courts in the park, and there are also horses for rent. There are ice rinks in the city, where men and women can meet and find suitable objects.</p>
<p>Literary women can join various literary groups such as writers associations, music societies, and drama associations. These groups hold meetings and dinners twice a week to talk, read works, and exchange opinions. The female members of this national body include unmarried women, chongfu, glamorous widows, famous actresses, singers, and female writers. There is no shortage of beauties to choose from. The dinner fee is extremely cheap, usually a shared cost of one or two US dollars per person. In the southern states of the United States, bullfighting is popular and held every season, which has become a great opportunity for Miss America to show off. They are all dressed as shepherds, riding wild bulls out of the wooden fence, with the audience clapping and cheering. If they can avoid being overthrown by the wild bull, they can steadily win the first prize. There is also the annual "Miss America" election in Atlantic City. Candidates from all over the world come to participate in the election with their families. Women from all walks of life who come to join in the fun also flock from all over the world. At that time, the contestants are dressed up in colorful dresses and sit on floats to parade through the city, their beauty is openly displayed and judged by everyone. The first place is mostly hired by Hollywood film companies for a lot of money. The women who are not selected can also return to their local areas and participate in fashion shows to relieve their boredom. Their photos are published in newspapers, and their popularity is still strong. In summary, they combine sports and art with entertainment, which is more meaningful than the Chinese Misses playing mahjong and pushing Pai Gow.</p>

<h3>Ghost Talk</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>We are walking in a rainy alley in the deep night. All the lights in the houses on the roadside are turned off, and nothing can be seen. The further we walk, the deeper we go into the darkness...</p>
<p>Wild dogs are barking wildly in the distance, and nearby, the leaves are rustling as they are blown by the wind.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid of anything?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't have any gold or silver treasures, so who would rob me?"</p>
<p>"Maybe there are," he deliberately whispered, "ghosts."</p>
<p>"Well, now is the scientific age of the 20th century," I laughed, "and besides, can ghosts be more scary than people?"</p>
<p>"Coming without a trace, going without a trace, a gust of cold wind..."</p>
<p>"That's just the lovableness of ghosts, not the fearfulness of ghosts," I said confidently.</p>
<p>"You say it so easily? One day, if I die, my soul will definitely come looking for you," he threatened, "then--"</p>
<p>"Welcome. Back in my childhood, under the lonely lamp late at night, I yearned for 'Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio' and 'Ying Chuang Yi Cao'. I've always longed for the world of ghosts and the life of foxes. I am a ghost lover because ghosts with conscience are much more lovely than the people in 'An Official's Record'. So, if one day you visit in the guise of a ghost, I will treat you with all sincerity. At that time, don't forget to tell me the story of the ghost country—that is, your country."</p>
<p>He shook his head and smiled: "It's really ghost talk."</p>
<p>"But ghost talk may be more real and pertinent than human talk."</p>
<p>He was silent, apparently tacitly agreeing to my "ghost talk." Friend, if that day comes when my spirit comes to find you from another world, what will you do? Welcome? Or reject?</p>
<h3>Three Topics on Hobbies</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jilou</p>
<p>Tea</p>
<p>Lighting a red clay</p>
<p>stove, with pine cones</p>
<p>recently cut,</p>
<p>the aroma is steaming, clum-</p>
<p>sy tea sets, faintly flicker</p>
<p>with faint wafts of water.</p>
<p>Do you prefer the</p>
<p>thickness of black tea,</p>
<p>or the clearness of green</p>
<p>tea?</p>
<p>Never mind the praise of the hard worker, that it is a distillation of history,</p>
<p>or the slander that it is a banishment by the world; "Taking a half-day's leisure in a busy life" is</p>
<p>more enjoyable than seven years of mundane dreams.</p>
<p>If wine is compared to a mistress, a brief</p>
<p>rendezvous, only seeking a moment's intoxication, comfort;</p>
<p>then tea is your good friend in your innermost being, one conver-</p>
<p>sation, and it can pour out all the dust, troubles, and</p>
<p>resentments in your heart.</p>
<p>Tasting fragrant tea, one can feel a sense of ancient yearning, and understand the mysteries of the world.</p>
<p>Smoke</p>
<p>In depressed days, I need a cigarette.</p>
<p>A cigarette that burns with a raging passion, and</p>
<p>twirls with a light misty atmosphere of tenderness.</p>
<p>When the light blue smoke floats around my lips,</p>
<p>the pungent taste stimulates my throat; I then</p>
<p>fall into deep thought from reality. A crane-like</p>
<p>mood, as if I have become feathered and am soaring</p>
<p>in the floating clouds.</p>
<p>Staring at the faint smoke</p>
<p>rings exhaled from my mouth, I feel unparalleled peace and tranquility.</p>
<p>With smoke, I will not feel lonely</p>
<p>and isolated.</p>
<p>Wine</p>
<p>Under the squeezing of life, you must feel</p>
<p>tired and numb, find a little bit of stimulation!</p>
<p>Rose red wine, apple green</p>
<p>Zhu Ye Qing, and even aged Huadiao wine, fresh</p>
<p>distilled rice wine; these will all give you excitement.</p>
<p>Lighting a soft hanging lamp, holding a light</p>
<p>green brew, this scene is enough to make you intoxicated.</p>
<p>What remains is a bit of tipsiness,</p>
<p>staring at the drunken face reflected in the mirror.</p>
<p>For the changes and fading of the years, the youth</p>
<p>of light; for the life of the grinding lost,</p>
<p>the ruddy complexion, in the blink of an eye, reappears</p>
<p>on your face.</p>
<p>Friends, wipe away the disappointed tears from your cheeks,</p>
<p>forget the resentment and depression in your heart!</p>
<p>Come, please drink this cup dry.</p>
<h3>Inscribing on Duo Ci's Painting of Geese</h3>
<p>— Wang Bijiang</p>
<p>Floating with feathers, combing white snow,</p>
<p>Su Shi's words were inherently created by heaven.</p>
<p>The fine son seems to have the ambition of Ping Huai,</p>
<p>Do not mistake the Taoist priest's affection in Shanyin.</p>
<p>Who can be most lifelike in depicting objects?</p>
<p>Cui Bai of Daliang is also this person.</p>
<p>If you have leisure, do not write late autumn miscellaneous things,</p>
<p>A basket on the mountain road can be sent to one's body.</p>
<p>(Cui Ziqiu Pond Double Goose Round, see Xuanhe's Painting Manual)</p>
<h3>Autumn Water</h3>
<p>— Cang Gu</p>
<p>In ancient years, I don't know which</p>
<p>thin poet compared a pool of autumn water to Yiren's</p>
<p>bright eyes. This is an appropriate</p>
<p>metaphor, like an irresistible force, calling</p>
<p>the young generation to sing with poems, and embrace it with their souls. The eternally cold</p>
<p>autumn water, in the poet's immortal imagination, flowed warmly.</p>
<p>I am a young man, and my joy in autumn</p>
<p>water is of course no exception; I also feel equally close to the poet's imagination. I love the shallowness of the autumn water, but I love even more the stories that the autumn water whispers under the small bridge.</p>
<p>Autumn water is a girl who loves to talk,</p>
<p>as long as you have the ability, she will tell you the stories she is familiar with like a lover.</p>
<p>Once, she told a story about a yellow</p>
<p>crucian carp and the love of a washerwoman with white arms. She said that whenever the little girl's delicate and white arms stirred in the water, the yellow</p>
<p>crucian carp would chase frantically, nibbling frantically. Sometimes, the</p>
<p>schooling fish would also be scattered. The little girl would often reach out her palm to catch it.</p>
<p>One day, it was finally pulled out of the water, and</p>
<p>began to feel the panic of suffocation; but for</p>
<p>the sake of love, it endured extreme pain, and</p>
<p>did not want to escape at all. The little girl's</p>
<p>gentle eyes revealed maternal pity</p>
<p>, and threw the infatuated little creature several feet</p>
<p>away from the water. The yellow crucian carp has since</p>
<p>lost its love.</p>
<p>I heard many of these stories in the days of the former village, at that time,</p>
<p>I had not yet learned to enjoy loneliness like middle-aged people. I wanted to forget this loneliness that approached death, so I followed the</p>
<p>river pond full of red radish flowers, to listen to beautiful legends, and to find my own slender shadow. I stared at the shadow on the water, and I found that in this world, I was not so lonely. I smiled, and the shadow in the water also smiled.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is "When the wild geese come, infinite thoughts". I, such a person who is content with ordinariness and indifference, suddenly felt an unprovoked longing. I miss the eternally cold autumn water,</p>
<p>and I also miss Yiren with bright eyes; but what I can never forget is a string of faded stories.</p>
<p>In autumn, I feel a sense of emptiness and disappointment.</p>
<h3>Poetic Aphorisms</h3>
<p>— Rong Dong</p>
<p>Poetry gives us simplicity and: ...</p>
<p>Uncolored joy.</p>
<p>I think that transposing emotions is the special</p>
<p>work of poetry--not conveying thoughts, but</p>
<p>arousing an undulation in the senses of the reader</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun: "Initially, I planned to leave a signal in front of the Daopo Inn, but then I feared it would be discovered by that fellow from the Meisha Fu company, so I had to abandon it. After having a quick bite, I rushed to the street, wandering around. On one hand, I was waiting for Tiger Brother; on the other hand, I hoped that within that short hour or so, Tiger Brother could receive my note from the inn and rush here to buy the inn. But I also thought it was laughable. How could such a wishful miracle ever happen?"</p>
<p>"After strolling for only a few steps, I suddenly heard a sneering sound behind me. The sneering was accompanied by some words, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. In that tense mood, I was naturally a bit neurotic, but in my subconscious, I did sense something ominous. Because here, people were coming and going, cars were rumbling, and voices were noisy, but this sneering sound was particularly jarring, coming from behind me. By the time I turned around to look, I didn't see anyone behaving strangely, just ordinary pedestrians. I勉强tried to convince myself: 'Once bitten by a snake, you're afraid of a broken rope for three years! ... It's just a case of seeing a snake in your cup'..."</p>
<p>"Unexpectedly, after walking a short distance further, I suddenly saw two shady-looking strong men approaching me head-on, seemingly blocking my path. As soon as they noticed that I was paying attention to them, the two fellows suddenly stopped. Based on my experience, I felt that these two fellows were acting suspiciously, and they were also staring at me with strange eyes. I could only pretend that it wasn't a big deal, and maintained my original attitude, walking forward. When I was less than three to five yards away from the two fellows, I suddenly saw them both spread their arms out, making a gesture to block my way. One of them shouted loudly at me: 'Hey, stop!'"</p>
<p>"At first, I ignored them, pretending that they were talking to someone behind me, without even turning my head, to appear innocent. Who knew that as I walked two more steps, the fellow who had spoken roared at me fiercely: 'Are you going to stop or not?' Then he revealed a malicious smile: 'Wearing your fur coat inside out, what are you pretending to be!'"</p>
<p>"Even if I could remain calm at other times, I couldn't help but turn around and take a look, with only one thought in my mind: hoping that these two fellows' sudden actions were directed at someone behind me. But when I turned around, alas! Three or four burly men, all with weapons in their hands, as if they were holding treasures, with incredible grins on their faces, as if to say: 'You've fallen into our trap! ... Where do you think you're going to run?'..."</p>
<p>"I didn't resist, nor could I resist. I followed them a few steps in a daze, and then followed them onto a car parked by the roadside. I also went to a place that looked like a police station in a daze, and was detained in a daze..."</p>
<p>"Wait, let me guess," I interrupted Yaoqun at this point, and asked: "I think all of this was probably one of Mr. Mai's tricks, right?..."</p>
<p>"Isn't it? But it wasn't until 3:00 p.m. that day, when the Japanese-puppet police officers brought out that fellow Meisha Fu, and confronted me with him..."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I interrupted Yaoqun again: "How did that fellow make his entrance?"</p>
<p>"Just like me, he was also arrested," Yaoqun said with a smile.</p>
<p>"How shallow!" I shook my head. "Isn't that too shallow?"</p>
