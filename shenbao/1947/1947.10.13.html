<p>〔合衆社紐約十二日電〕巾美兩方正在此間及筆盛頓磋商消彌處置日本和約方式上兩國間之不協調會點。中美問最大之問題厥爲日本可得具有之商船之數字，中國希望限制之，使其遠較美國所主張者爲小。一般意見以爲，中國將善用其地位，儘量拖延和約，美國若肯作若干讓步，則中國將同意放棄否決權，由十一國起草和約。中國代表本週聆間蘇聯痛責美國對日政策在軍建日本再度侵略時，頗感欣慰。中國雖不同意美國扶助日本意在利用之作為帝國主義謀略跳板之說，然中國深感蘇聯反對日本之軍振，用意至善。</p>

<h3>對美人援華言論　我應持冷靜態度　奚玉書評蒲立特建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕奚玉書頃評浦之特緊急援筆建議，大意謂：蒲氏用意甚好，但太理想化，因蒲氏之發表此文，完全站在民衆立傷，其身份爲魯斯「生活雜誌」之代表。在實際政治上，恐未必能發生多大影響。整個問題為美國之對華態度，尙欠明朗化，國人對此類友邦人士言論，應持以冷靜，不必因之而時悲時喜。吾人如以常理而論，在整個第二次世界大戰中，中國之貢獻極大，本身亦幾瀕於危，但美國仍採歐洲第一之政策，對華之租借援助甚微。此時中國重陷困境，美對筆應作大量之援助，不必斤斤計較，事實上今日中國之問題，亦決非數億美元所能解。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政委蔣勻田頃對蒲立特緊急援華建議，發表意見稱：一此項建議，甚爲適時，惟麥帥未必肯來華任職。我國現所需要者爲無條件之大規模援助，包括軍火，物資，財政援助及派遣工　師技術人員等。至於麥帥之來不來華，關係並不大。最重要者，美國對華政策不能再打商　算盤，否則中國周深受其害美國亦將有後悔之一日。」</p>

<h3>讀蒲立特「訪華觀感」之所感—中美關係的再檢討—</h3>
<p>美國前駐法蘇大使蒲立特氏在「生活」雜誌上發表「訪華觀感」的長篇報吿，主張美國緊急援華，並且建義推選麥克阿瑟元帥主管十三億五千萬元援華計劃。此一論文，已引起中美雙方人士的相當注意。吾人當蒲氏留華期問，曾相與談叙，坦白交換意見，他在中國又週遊各地，多方接觸；故深信蒲氏的觀察，自有他可靠的實際材料作爲依據。</p>
<p>蒲氏的建議，其用意在以美國援助之力，促使中國勿入於蘇聯之掌握。可是大美晚報社論竟謂若干美國人寗願保持此十三億五千萬美元不付，而讓蘇聯控制中國好了。他們兩方見解的誰是誰非，姑且不管，但我們必須首先說明的；中國始終是中國，始終是屹立不搖的中國。美國援助也罷，不援助也罷，中國必始終爲國家領土主權的完整而奮鬥到底的，決不願墜入蘇聯之掌握，也未必甘爲美國之附庸。不過我們要請若干美國朋友注意的，背棄中國而簽訂雅爾達協定的，究竟是美國當局，中國却並沒有對不起美國的地方</p>
<p>我們願乘蒲立特氏「訪華觀感」發表之際，提出我們對於中美關係的意見，供關心此一問題人士的研討。</p>
<p>中美間的問題，槪括起來說，可以分爲下列數點：</p>
<p>第一，是美國對中國的認識。中國這個國家，顯然比美國落後，無論那一方面，距美國現在的標準都很遠·這是事實；這不容否認，也無須諱言。不過有一點，我們必須共同注意，卽是：中國這個國家，有若干重要地方與美國並無不同。凡在美國不能適用的東西，如共產主義，在中國也決不能適用。凡是美國人所重視的物事，如政府內部的「整肅運動」，及國家民族利益的保持，中國也一樣重視。且因中國的國勢不及美國强，政府的茶礎不如笑國安定，母寗說是中國人對於上述兩項的重視，必更超過於美國人。「己所不欲，勿施於人」。美國自己排斥共產主義，而如蒲氏所指出，竟認「中國共產黨祗是土地改革者，」故不妨在中國推行共產主義：美國政府自身採「整肅政策」，而認爲中國要「進步」，却須採容共式的「聯合政府」。這在美國是稍欠考慮的</p>
<p>第二，是美國對中國政府的認識問題。凡稍稍關心美國輿論的人，都知道美國輿論對我們政府的批評，極其惡劣。雖然蒲立特氏認爲「蔣主席之遠見與睿智，爲歷來政治家所不可及，」但美國人總以爲中國政府效率太差了，太無能了，尤其魏德邁將軍大駡了一頓「貪汚與無能」。但我們願提請美國朋友們注意的是：請他們設身處地的代中國政府想想，像這樣外交內政，處處牽掣，任何政策，都不能放手去做的今天，在八年抗戰以後，又遇到空前的匪患，恐怕任何政府，也無萬應良方，可以一劑而愈吧。日前上海市的工潮，因黨政軍各機關協力應付得當，早日平息，共匪陰謀無由得逞，本市西僑有關政府能力遠超出於歐美國家之上。這確是公道的看法。今日中國的情形，百孔千瘡，幾有無從下手之慨，政府欲從事挽救，常感扶得東來西又倒：蒲立特氏對這點看得很淸楚。這是由於他乃「生活」「幸福」兩大雜誌的作家，他有自由的身份，容易與廣大樸實的中國人民接近的緣故。</p>
<p>第三，是美國對中國的援助。講到這個問題，我們應注意如下兩點：其一，是關於援助的看法。其二，是這種援助的效用。先講看法，我們要知道無論那兩個國家，如果講援助，必定涉及互利。單方面有益的援助，只是救濟性質，那是不能持久的。美國援華，簡單地說，應是互利的問題。不幸有些美國人，却把這看作單方而有利於中國的事。換言之，卽是誤會爲這只是慈善性質的救濟，於是影響了美國政策的堅定執行，而呈現着游移動盪的現象。其次，是救濟的效果。美國與論，近來有一種傾向，似以爲中國乃是一個「無底洞」，美國援助的效果是極少的。這種看法的來源，一由於美國人士不明瞭中國問題的內在眞義，一是由於少數留華營商的美僑或許還不能忘情舊日的情景，於是以死硬派的狹隘觀點批評中國的事情，使美國政府的政策也受到若干影響。要解答此一問題，只要把抗戰期問美國資助中國物資在總額中數量的渺小，與中國所成就的偉大，一相比較，就可以得到。老實說，世界各國中，再沒有像中國這樣審愼運用外來物資的。我們從未以絲毫美國助我們的物資，作任何陰險而有害於美國的圖謀。請美國人把蘇聯如何運用美國援助的物資作一比較罷。</p>
<p>第四，明瞭了上述三點，我們可以進而檢討美國的政策了。美國政策果矛盾的。姑且撇開了上舉對共黨的熊度在中國的與在美國的處置不同一點不論，專論美國一般對華政策，可說是時而積極，時而消極，時而把中國捧到天上，時而把中國壓在地下。卽如馬歇爾元帥的來華，在其未來之前，美對華政策何等熱烈，而馬氏去後，又變爲何等冷淡，馬氏在華所遭遇任務之困難，吾人極端同情，而中共終未能走上與政府和平合作的大道，在馬氏心頭一定認爲不可磨滅的憾事。惟美國人士亦知否中國在美國此種搖擺不定的政策下所受之痛苦經騐爲何如？中國人深知友邦用心的純潔，並深感其亦誠的可佩，所以不惜委曲以求全，知其不可而爲之。無如美國過去一階段對中國所採的政策，是死路，是絕路，其必須改弦史張是注定了的。美國今日回首前塵，理宜以堅定代替徬徨、以積極代替消極，方爲自助助友之道。這在蒲立特氏，當爲比較看得明白。</p>
<p>第五，還有一點，我們願提出以補蒲氏論文的缺憾的，卽是：耍認識中國，必須從歷史上去看。從歷史上看中國，有兩點應注意；一是中國今日，何以貧困到如此地步？一是中國在歷史上遭遇困難時，是如何解脫出來？先講第一點，中國今日的一切，是歷史上的積累。二百八十年的異族統治，百年來不平等條約的束縛，二十年的軍閥弄兵，二十年的共黨禍國，八年的抗日血戰，使中國國力民力疲憊到這般地步。今日政府，是這種歷史積累下的苦撐者。它的努力容有未盡，但把這一付千斤重担放在它一雙肩上，說這統是現政府的過錯，這是不合邏輯的，也是不公道的。其次，是中國這五千年來，在歷史上所遭遇的危機，十百倍於今天，更僕難數。中國人都是以自己的力量，來打破，來復興的。中國人從沒有有專靠外援的心理。所以它能　續五千年之久，而仍然挺立於天地間。今天中國的處境雖然歡迎外援，但它絕無吿哀乞憐之意！中國人民尤其不願用『敲詐』的方法以取得人的援助。中國人是一個忠實的朋友，但是一個有朋友。</p>
<p>總括一句話；今天中美交誼的增進，存在於兩國間陰暗混濁空氣的澄清，實在太重要了，而其達到之途徑，甚為容易，只要測由互諒到互信，由互信到互尊，光明的坦途，必在兩國人民的眼前！</p>

<h3>朱家驛談共產國際</h3>
<p>「共產國際新組織的出現，與其說是第三國際的復活，毋寗說是第三國際利用國際問矛盾的一貫伎倆，因爲共產黨策略一向不守信義，不爲條約義務所拘束，時時利用國際形勢之轉變蹈睱乘隙，步求進取。至其組微形態之或　或現，原不足妨碍其國際政策之擴張，故一九四三年莫斯科宣布取銷第三國際組織，本是一　滑稽劇，只爲求得換取盟邦援助的一種策略而已。實際上，四年來共產黨在我國的行動，一如在世界各地，尤其東歐各國，無不以其國際政策爲依歸。根據聯合國憲章原則，各國應互相尊重各民族利益，各有抉擇其木國政制的自由。今以共產國際的積種行動，此原則固已直接遭受破壞，人類正義和道德，亦大受威脅，並趨　織，而因其普遍推行國際政策，所有非共產國家與人民，實皆面臨生死存亡關頭。愛好民主國家，誠皆　爲　，所以我們不可視爲共產國際的復現，只是對抗　　爾經濟援歐與反美的外交行動。几是擁護聯合國的國家，爲着自己獨立生存，應緊密合作，共謀政治經濟的安定，剷除亂源，加強聯合國的組織力量，建立和平，因爲惟有集體行動，才可以獲得集體安全，使全世界各民族獨立共存，解除赤色國際的威脅。</p>

<h3>蒲立特訪華觀感　趨昨日第五版</h3>
<p>馬歇爾將軍於一九四五年十二月二十二日抵達中國陪都　慶。他的威望很高，竟能於一九四六年一月十日，使中國政府與共黨簽訂了停止衝突恢復交通的協定。次之，當他於一九四六年三月十三日回返華府之前，似乎對於東北停戰的實現，也已開關了可能的途徑。從表面看來，馬歇爾在不到三個月的時間之内，斡旋中國國内的停止衡突，似乎頗有收穫。</p>
<p>這個表面現象是騙人的。蘇聯政府的目的與馬歇爾將軍並不相同。日本投降之日，東北並無中共軍隊。蘇方的計劃是利用馬歇爾所斡旋的</p>
<p>停戰時間　儘量把共軍自華北運往東北，而把接收自東北日軍的大量武器，配備共軍。利出停戰時間，到中共軍隊裝　齊全的時候，蘇軍再　　退。這個計劃獲得了完全的實現。</p>
<p>馬　爾將軍離華返美之後的三天，蘇軍　自四平　　退，中共軍即行攻入。四平街爲瀋陽與長春之間的戰略城市，爲東西南北的鐵路交叉點。四月十四日蘇軍自長春撤退後，中共軍即進攻該城。馬歇爾將軍於四月十七日再度赴華，第二天長春即爲巾共攻陷。</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍仍以其一貫的決心與尊嚴，進行任務。實際上，他從開始的時候，就絕無成功的機會。中共效忠於莫斯科，國民黨效忠於其國家，若要使兩者眞正合作，其不可能，有如水與油之無法交融。在中國如此，在世界任何國家都是如此。是故馬歇爾在華工作的最後結論爲：從來沒有一個信畫卓著的軍人，被派執行這樣一個無望與不智的政治使命。</p>
<p>馬歇爾使命失敗之後，美國對華政策陷入於一種疲倦的冷淡，採取一種漠然地「讓中國自己撹去」的傾向。這是一種特別危險的政策，因為要壓迫中國政府接受我們那稱片面與錯誤的想法，以為蘇聯是「愛好和平的民主國家」，中共僅為土地改革者，有　加中國政府的必要，（這種觀點，目前美國政府已經完全放棄了），所以　絕了對中國政府的援助。　已指　給中國的五億　　款，</p>
<p>截留不放　一九四六年七月·由美國政府批准且由陳納德着手的「八又三分之一隊的空軍計劃」，於一九四六年九月由我片面行動而停止。要該項計劃，美國同意配備中國八又三分之一隊的空軍，並供給維持用的零件。次之，一九四六年春所訂合約，對於我們留在中國的舊車輛供給零件一事，亦未履行。</p>
<p>而最嚴重的一件事，乃是我們以美國　，美國機槍及步槍，裝配了中國若干師及若干部隊的一部份，答應繼續供給彈藥，但又截留彈藥的出口執照。因此，這種美國配備的軍隊，彈藥吿竭，面對着由蘇聯給以大量日本軍火而新配備的共軍。美國政府意欲壓迫中國政府採取一種我們目前已知其錯誤的政策，結果等於解除了友人的武裝，蘇聯在另一方面却裝備了我們敵人。直到今年春天，情形方始淸淸楚楚地　在面前，除非我們能認識國家利益之攸關，一面採取相稱的行勁，否則不是「讓中國自己攪去」，而是蘇聯要去攪了。於是派魏　將軍赴華考察情勢。情勢究竟怎樣呢？</p>
<p>今日中國政府穩固地掌握着中國，達及北方。小股的匪徒，有些自稱爲共黨，聲踞在長江以南偏僻之處，但上海人稱長江以南為「和平建設區域」，這句話是對的。從華北到蘇聯邊境，則為戰區。</p>
<p>但戰事的情形，則與美國軍隊在兩次大戰中歐洲戰塲所有的作戰經騐完全不同。共軍所用的是遊擊戰術，行動迅速，夜間出擊，而白日躱蔽休息，一個觀察家倘使坐了飛機，在華北或東北共黨遊擊隊散佈的地區，低飛數百哩，決不會看見一兵一卒，或部隊行動的跡象，到了天黑，共軍集中，急速向攻擊目標前進，往往一夜走二十喱，實行夜裹。共黨之欲</p>
<p>推翻政府　其方法不在擊敗國軍，而在破壞全國的經濟生活。所以毫不猶豫地焚毀城鎭，破壞鐵路，電報，電話綫，破壞工廠的機器，炸毀工業設備如發電廠等，他舞所不能帶走的東西。</p>
<p>國軍意欲保護城鎭，因此大部份牽制在固定之處。他們行動較共軍為　慢，往往當他們出擊的時候，發現共軍已於夜間偷偸逃遁了。從理論上說，共軍爲了顏面，必須保衡赤都延安，當國軍猛烈進攻該城的時候，必　　滅其最大的主力。但事實上，政府攻陷該城，却幷沒有　殲滅其軍隊，他們早已流竄到鄰省山西境内去了。目前國軍正在粛清山東共軍，但早有大隊共軍流竄到河南，剩下的祗是一片荒凉之地。這就是華北進行的戰事情形。</p>
<p>東北的情形又有不同。除蘇軍佔據的大連旅順之外，國軍掌握着東北南部的大部分。共軍則據有東北的其餘部份，除了中間有瀋陽遠迄吉林的一條狹長地帶，這一地帶是沿着鐵路的，此路中經四平街及長春。這鐵路現已不成為鐵路了，四平街南三十哩地以北，所有橋樑，悉為共軍破壞，枕木大部分焚燬，許多鐵軌，亦因焚燒而驚曲。</p>
<p>因此現在政府手中的長春市，已完全斷絕了鐵路交通。一度曾爲偽滿首府的長春，街迅廣闊，建築華麗，幷有近百萬的居民，各方面和華盛頓市相類似。長春一帶有肥沃的土壤和優美的景色，和華盛頓州的史北根流域相彷彿。長春四周的農村十分豐盛，因此該市迄今仍有充足的糧食，運糧大都用牛車。但長春並無烘斤。而東北的冬天却像北極一般的寒冷，因此，每一槐能够斬下的樹木，甚至門窗地板棟樑之類，都　當作取　的柴火了。</p>
<p>長春現由新一軍據守着。該軍可說是國軍的勁旅，他們還是史迪威將軍在緬甸訓練幷裝備成的。史迪威將軍認爲：中國士兵，只要予以良好的訓練，衣着，供養，配備，和指揮，就相等於世界上任何强國的士兵。新一軍的儀表迄仍</p>
<p>威武得很　足證史迪　將軍的信念是不錯的。新一軍士兵熱情地憶念着美國人，信任何美國人在街上經過時，他們面露笑容，高聲招呼。可是在他們勇敢的儀表背後，却已消失了他們在美軍指揮時期所有的那種力量，他們僅僅有美國的配備，自從他們在緬甸和我國軍隊幷肩作戰時候起，就開始使用那批武器，可是現在已經陳舊了，百分之四十的步槍因使用過久，所以射擊時已不能準確，他們的的美國機槍需要新的槍膛，他們雖有優良的美國砲，但因缺少砲彈，所以連演習射擊都不可能　他們的卡車大都已經破舊不堪，且因我國未測遵守合約，不把零件交給他們，所以他們無法加以修理。他們一加要飛機都沒有，甚至連偵察都不能，這完全因為我們並沒有實踐諾言，實現「八又三分之一隊空軍計劃」。我們早先促使中國政府採用美式配備，而後竟拒絕簽發彈藥出口的許可證，因此已使中國士兵陷於絕望的邊緣，他們的東　和西邊大量的共軍，預料共軍將於九月再要發動政勢。（下接第四版）</p>

<h3>美對朝鮮問題新建議　中英表示原則贊同　我主張由聯合國短期託管</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十二日電〕權威方面十二日透露：中英兩國已在「原則」上贊助行將在數日內提交聯合國之美國對韓提案，按美提案要朮聯合國監視朝鮮之大選及美蘇兩眾之撤退。中國且勸吿美代表團稱，中國決意要求大會建議聯合國托管朝鮮若干時期，美國則不擬將此點列入其提案。美國之地位　括如次：如聯合國通過美建議，設立一機構，則聯合國應自負責決定過渡期間管制韓國之方式。美國通知中國，如中國希望建議托管方式，則中國應在聯合國處理此問題時逕行提出之。同時據悉蘇代表團將反對美國提案，認爲破壞莫斯科協定，然多數國家代表團之綜合意見，則認爲蘇聯上月建議美蘇共同撤退而任韓人自行解決難題後，蘇聯之地位已見削弱。中國駐漢城總領事劉馭萬自韓飛抵紐約，擊示中國對此事極感興趣，渠刻在向　維鈞博士及其他代表報吿韓國之近况。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十二晶電〕莫斯科電台昨晚廣播稱：莫洛托尖致函馬卿稱，「漢城美蘇混合委會美代表團之態度，明示美代表團無意繼續混合會議之工作以取得協議，解決有關依照莫斯科協定建立朝鮮臨時民主政府之問題。美代表團違反莫斯科協定及美蘇政府一九四七年五月間成立之協議，堅決主張不僅南北韓宣言支持莫斯科協定忠實履行其條件之民主政黨及團體，可以參加臨時政府，即使未簽字宣言而策動反對莫斯科協定及繼續爲「反托管委會」一份子之反動團體，應亦包括在內。蘇代表團決意維護英斯科協定，對此碾難同意。美代表團之態度，業使依英斯科協定建立朝鮮臨時民主政府之舉爲不可能，而阻礙成立韓國統一且民主之政府。故蘇聯已訓令在漢城之代表團提出一新建議，使韓人有一機會自行建立政府，不必　美蘇參預州事，而美蘇軍隊亦應自韓撤退」但美方迄未提出答覆。</p>
<h3>聯大政治小組會通過　希臘問題修正案　顧維鈞駁斥蘇聯牽涉我國言論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十一日電〕美國提出希臘問題修正案，主張聯合國「紀錄」南，保，阿三國資助希臘遊擊隊，並督令三國停止此項援助後，聯合國大會十一日卒將此修正案通過，卅六票贊成，六票反對，十票棄權。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功潮十一日電〕美國前時要求聯合國譴責南，保，阿三國制造巴爾幹之不安，十一日美突然退讓，惟仍堅主聯大應責令三國以後不再支援希臘之游擊隊。由於反對聲勢日增，美代表詹森卒贊成英法之修正案，此農村建設請聯大注意巴爾幹調査團之多數判斷，希遊擊隊會受邊境隣國之資助。</p>
<p>蘇代表維辛斯基立即起而反　英法之補充案，稱之與美國原先之提案係「邱之貉。維氏力稱：「希臘之現狀由於其國內之局勢及外國之干涉，希臘如此，巾國如此，印尼亦如此。外國干涉所到之處，莫不步希臘之後塵」。</p>
<p>中國代表顧維鈞乃反唇相譏，謂「本人無意與維氏衝突，然不能長此緘默而任此錯誤見解存在。中國猶如他國，由於長期之奮鬥，困難孔多，然中國是否受有外來之干涉，閣下應同意在此一方面中國知之最稔，如中國遭受干涉，必能最先提出而加以反對。表面之現象常非事實，暗中發生之事最爲嚴重。如有任何干涉發生之可能，中國政府將立即向之挑戰而控諸於聯合國」。關於英法修正案，顧氏以爲不必直接或間接指出三國之過失，「如不予提起，能使提案其他部份易於通過，則此誠爲必要」。中國代表團對此案事實並無意見，惟調査團中國代表會投票贊成多數之報吿，「然如略去一節而能增進廣泛之合作，則德得加以考慮，追究責任尙屬次要。吾人應爲者，乃在加强合作，促進巴爾幹之和平與寗靜」。</p>

<p>條約委會工作宣告結束〔路透社維也納十一日電〕四張　國條約委員會之四强代表　於十一日晨　署該委員會應向外長會議提出之最後報吿。四强委員會之工作，至此雖吿結束，但任務並未連到。據英代表幽發表聲明稱，委員會並未能就關於奧國條約之各　點成立協議，甚至對於縮小意見距離亦殊乏進展，主要　結仍爲德國資產問題。當會凌之初，原期得由一專家委員會，硏究有關德資產之具體事實，以担任四强委員會之卞要工作，惟以蘇聯自始即不見該專家委員會得有工作之獨立性，因此此一期望，卒未實　。</p>

<p>〔路邊社紐約十一日電〕出席聯大之六阿拉伯國代表團今日發表聲明，對於美國之支持巴勒斯坦分治計劃，表示驚異。宣言有謂，美國此一政策若果付諸施行，將破壞美國傳統的和平意向，阿拉伯代表團深盼美國勿採取勿以智　公理爲據之行動途徑。美國旣爲强國，竟提出明知不能施行必致引起動亂之辦法，殊覺費解。在猶太建國派未放棄其野心前，近東將不得安寗。</p>
<p>阿拉伯代表團相信有和平解決之必要及可能，但其先決條件，乃必須由美國忠吿猶太建國派以彼等之計劃決不可行，彼企圖覓取和平解決者，必須加緊努力。阿拉伯代表團深信聯大必能依據憲章，不致提出引起衝突可能性之建議案。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十一日電〕據倫敦電稱，世界猶太建國會秘書長高恩，對美國之準備支持分治，表示感謝，渠並主張在猶阿兩國成立前，應由國際軍在聖地維持秩序，志願軍可由聯合國會員國供給。</p>

<h3>波蘭人篤信宗敎　民衆中百分之九五是天主敎徒共產黨員也向上帝低頭　「波蘭行」第六信本報特派員毛樹淸</h3>
<p>〔本報華沙九月廿九日航訊〕在波蘭的外國記者，常常歡喜問波蘭人是不是共產黨？我問過一位外交部的女職員，她很嬌媚地說：「許多美國新聞記者，說我的思想和行動，紅得厲害；其實，我很坦白地吿訴他們，我是粉紅色，因爲我是波蘭民主黨的黨員，民主黨雖然也參加共產黨的聯合政府，但畢竟不是共產黨」！</p>
<p>她說：許多波蘭人遲遲不願加入共產黨，最主要的原因是爲了宗敎信仰。全波闌二千三百萬人口，百分之九十五是梵蒂岡的天主敎徒，百分之四是屬於「希臘正敎」，百分之一回敎，佛敎，及其他。根據波蘭的傳統的宗教信仰，嬰孩由父母代受「洗禮」，從此，他就終身注定是天主敎徒。那位女秘書頭腦很「前進」，她說：「這種信仰是不公道的，因爲嬰孩本身無知」！</p>
<p>但是，大部份的波蘭人，仍然是梵蒂岡天主敎的虔敬的「善男信女」。我在華沙參觀過一座呌做「亞歷山大」的天主敎堂，敎堂的神壇，禮拜廳，都在一九四四年的巷戰巾毀去，至今仍然無力修復。然而那些虔誠的信徒，星期天仍舊照樣做「彌撤」，他們在僅餘的地窑裏跪下祈禱，地窖小，許多人魚貫站立在門外。</p>
<p>像這樣一個有虔誠的宗敎力量的國家，共產黨的思想和學說，就不容易逢迎人民的心理。</p>
<p>在華沙，有這麽一段故事：今年二月一日，波蘭復國以後的第一屆國會正式開慕，那天，選舉共產黨的首腦皮魯特爲波蘭共和國大總統，並且討論總統就職的誓詞和儀式，若干議員主張廢除總統誓詞中：「遵奉萬能上帝的意旨」一句，他說：「上帝是虛假飄渺的，總統社須盡忠國家，服務人民就够了，無需乎上帝！」當時有很多共產黨和社會黨的議員鼓掌附和。這樣，可把一位無黨無派的天主敎議員激怒了，他漲紅了臉站起來說「波蘭有百分之九十五人民信舉上帝，民選的總統，不能和人民的意旨背道而馳，不能讓人民失望」！他還說：「託庇上帝，與國家無損，於人民有益，於政府有利」。他演講了半個多鐘頭，使許多共產黨議員爲之心折。表決的時候，據說除了一部份社會黨員反對上帝外，共產黨全部以及其他許多小黨派，都贊成保　「萬能卜帝」句。因此，身爲老共產黨皮魯特總統，就職那天，仍然恭恭敬敬宣誓：「遵奉上帝的意旨。</p>
<p>據說，國會開會那天，共產黨的巨頭之一，工業部長閔斯，和共產黨的中央書記長戈舉卡，坐在會場左角的前排，　斯對討論「上帝案」根本不感興趣，竟昏昏睡了過去。舉手表決的時候，戈墨卡把他狠狠推醒，並且對他說：「你這傢伙，一生不知犯了多少罪惡，還不趕快舉手，請求上帝的寬恕」因此，閔斯在瞌睡中也舉了手，增加了「保留上帝案」的一　！</p>
<p>如果說：農業社會必然會產生强有力的宗敎信仰，那麼，波蘭共產黨這種和天主敎妥協的態度，不僅是現實的，而且是睿智的。在波蘭國慶日，首相官邸的遊園會上，我遇見一位年靑的斯屈拉斯基太太，她的名字就呌做「基督教」，她是波蘭全國合作事業協會的會長，國會議員，倫敦世界合作會議的波蘭首席代表，一個年方三十的女共產黨員。我問她爲什麽不改一個名字？她大聲笑起來：「這有什麽了不起的關係，共產黨和天主敎，可以並行不悖！」</p>
<p>她說：她們現在正在努力建設一個新波蘭，全國的政治經濟大政應該逐漸移到三十歲人的手裏。她說：她所領導的全國合作事業，有三百多萬人成爲合作社的社員。她也聽到過中國的合作事業正在蓬勃展開，她非常希望有機會時訪問中國。（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕天主教文化協進會駐歐特派員王文濤，昨午後在迪化南路仲明工廠正式試駛其最近改造成功之機器三輪車，結果成績異常圓滿，該車將為出現於本市之第一輛機器三輪車。</p>
<p>王氏　曾留歐十餘載，與意大利工業界往還頗密，平時對各項機器工業，悉心研究，頗多心得。最近返國後，因感國人對「製造工業」大都缺乏認識，爲提高各方硏習工業之興趣起見，特出其在意設計改造之小型引擎，首先改裝三輪車。此項引擎重僅七公斤，性能完全與普通汽車引擎相同，且具有優點甚多：　耗油極少，一加侖汽汕可行一百餘里。　有一匹半馬力，能載客四五人左右。　駕駛極易，僅有快慢二閘，而速度及爬山力與普通汽車無異。　適合裝置於任何一輛現有之三輪車上，毋須另行改造。　此項引擎現値美金五十元，如裝配於一千餘萬元之三輸車上，所費蛟一機器脚踏車尤康。以上各點昨試駛時，經仲明工廠技師覺仲廉實地觀察，認爲均符合標準。</p>
<p>裝配該車之仲明工廠爲范爭波所主辦，范對研究工業建設，極爲熱心，該廠現已能自製引擎，惟從不出售，所製出品，專供硏究改進之用。王氏將來即擬在滬與該廠合作，製造此項裝配三輪車之小型引擎。據工業人士談稱：此項引擎爲確能在本國以優秀技術製造，定價低廉，非但可爭取大量外匯，且本市交通混亂之情狀，必可因機動車輛逐漸代替人力車輛而漸臻改善。〔附圖即爲試駛之機器三輪車·本報攝）</p>
<p>王文濤另一發明·外國影片國語配音</p>
<p>除機器三輪車外，王氏尙有將外國影片改用國證配音之工作，現亦試騐完成。此項配音不同於「意譯風」之單純解釋劇情，而係將影片中之每一音響及對白動作，俱改用國語發音。王氏自意携歸之「一舞難忘」國語配音影片，定明日上午十時在大上海戲院招待各界參觀。彼擬綜合各方意見，將來大量裝配富有敎育意識之外片國語發音，俾促成我國電化敎育之進展。</p>
<h3>蒲立特訪華觀感　上文接第二版</h3>
<p>他們通趣南方唯一的交通工具，就是一條敗壞不堪的鐵路，路的東西兩側相距不過幾哩的地方，就有共軍潛伏威脅着。他們的處境是那麼危險，將會使任何歐美的官兵枕戈待且而不敢入睡。他們却處之泰然，堅信他們能够逐退共軍對於長春的任何攻擊，而且縱使他們和南方的聯絡全被切斷，他們也深信力能堅守不敗，以待</p>
<p>不論戰事的結果如何，中國政府決不能從東北撤退，且</p>
<p>不論代價　如何重大，必須奮力派遣軍隊開赴柬北增援。萬一東北棄守，或遭共軍武力奪佔，則招致中國不幸的事態，便將接踵而來。</p>
<p>我們不難預測，共黨會立即宣佈「東北人民共和國」的「獨立」，或這個「共和國」立將得到「外蒙古人民獨立共和國」的承認，因爲它完全受蘇聯的控制，於是兩個「獨立共和國」就將訂立「互助條約」。我們也不難想像到莫洛托夫就將邀請中國駐蘇大使，並且極有禮貌的提醒他說，蘇聯與「外蒙古人民共和國」間訂有一個互助條約，所以假使中國政府企圖以武力收復東九省，外蒙即將出而援助一東北人民共和國」，而蘇聯就將根據與外蒙的條約關係，不得不使用武力，以阻止中國政府攻擊外蒙的軍隊。中國政府懾於蘇聯的干涉，將不敢作收復東九省的企圖於是史達林在雅爾達的工作，就獲得了最後的成功</p>
<p>他將穩然控制東北的全部。而東北則是亞洲最肥美的一片領土。面積有法·德合併起來那麽大，在它的山脈之間，有和世界　豐饒的地方一樣肥沃的農業地帶，大量出產小麥·玉蜀黍·大豆以及其他一切北方的農作物；它有豐富的煤·鐵以至黃金的鑛藏，擁有已經開發與未經開發的水力以及森林的巨大富源，戰前佔有中國全部工業的百分之七十，但人口祇有四千萬，給予過剩的中國農民一個移殖的極大可能機會，所以東北對於中國將來的開發，關係異常重大。</p>
<p>政府在東北的軍隊，因　美式裝備，現正</p>
<p>缺少彈藥　這個需要異常迫切，已經刻不容緩，而需立即採取行動。這個問題在時間與重要方面講，應在對華作有效的一般性援助之前，先求解決。堅守東北南部是將來採取攻勢的一個先決條件，我們不許中國政府自美國購買及運輸彈藥，以應美式裝備的需要—作爲威迫</p>
<p>蔣主席遵守約束的手段，而這項約束我們現在已經認爲是一種極大的錯誤了。鑒於東北國軍因我們的不智行爲而異常缺乏彈藥，又鑒於史達林控制東北對於中國—最後對於我們本身—的嚴軍後果，僅僅取銷美國對華禁運軍火的命令還嫌不足。杜魯門總統應該像羅斯福總統在鄧克爾克撤退後英法嚴重缺乏槍砲彈藥時所做的一樣，採取迅速的行動。那時，羅斯福總統認爲美軍的某些彈藥應予廢棄，也就是說，宣佈該項軍火已不再適合於美軍的使用。這樣，它們就可合法出售，並且有大量彈藥，以一元的貨色，貶爲一角，售予英國。現在我們有數十萬噸積存的彈藥，棄置在世界各地，任其霉爛，生銹；如在菲律賓的有七萬噸，在冲繩島的更多，在阿留申羣島也更多，在日本的數量更大，還有在美國的。上項彈藥中可在東北使用的，應該立即宣佈廢槳售予中國，並且趕速運輸。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統有權立即採取這項行動，他無須等待國會的重開。他還能够及時行動，便東北不入蘇聯的掌握中去。如果他不採行動，那末，國會復會後的首要步驟之一，就應該調査我們的對華政策。對於我國政府與駐外人員中那些不克維護美國人民重大利益的人士，這樣一個調査至少可以確定他們的責任和宣佈他們的姓名。我們如</p>
<p>及時行動　還能使東北不入蘇聯的掌握，因此保證了中國領土的完整。但是這項行動雖然極關緊要可是還嫌不够。我們不但要維護中國成爲一個自由的國家，而且務必使它成爲一個　全而强大的國家—在適當時構能够在遠東方面作爲對抗蘇維埃帝國主義的眞正力量。中國若要强盛，必須先求內部的安定，要求內部的安定，必須首先獲得財政上的穩定。</p>
<p>今日中國已墮入惡性循環的漩渦中，這種情勢對於第一次世界大戰後的歐洲人，已是司空見慣的了。中國從一九三七年以來就一直在作戰。日人幾乎佔領了所有的大城市，金融中心和工業地帶。她所有的財源也落入日人的手中。因此，她不能以發售公債來支特抗戰，而且它的稅收祇能抵債戰費的極小部份。結果，她支付戰費的唯一辦法，就是發行紙幣。</p>
<p>政府增發紙幣的財政，逐漸使幣値降低。物價跟着上漲。所有固定收入的階級開始感受極大的痛苦。公債儲蓄，保險證劵，與除了能够生產的農田以外所有其他形式的財富都一起貶値。中產階級的儲蓄漸次枯竭。實際上戰時財政的重負落在中產階級的肩上，致收入固定的軍，公，敎人員與仰賴證劵固定息金收入而生活的人，生活水準之降低。目前中國情形遠不如第一次大戰後德國那樣惡劣，但情勢已够惡劣的了。按目前中國幣値計算，現時的生活費用，約爲一九三六年日本侵華以前的三萬倍。都市工人的工資，已按生活費用的增加而提高。在上海由於工會的力量，工人的生活水準却較戰前提高三分之二。但是在一九三六年獲得三千元政府公債息金收入的人，現在收入的購買力祇等於一九三六年時的一角錢。中產階級已經破產了而且目前</p>
<p>鎭壓共黨　叛亂的軍事費用，仍佔政府全部支出的約百分之七十，而政府的各項支出約有三分之二，仍賴印發紙幣來維持。結果，遂使生活費用不斷增加</p>
<p>政府爲謀减低用於戰事方面的支出起見，對於官兵的薪餉，未予提高。士兵每月餉銀的收入，祇相當於美金一元半。少將每月的收入，相當於美金十七元。以這樣微薄的金額，他們顯然不能贍養家庭，所以爲要提高士氣，以及爲了其他的理由，官兵　餉應該增加四四倍，也很　然。但是陸軍官兵的員額在四百萬人以上，薪餉如果提高四倍，政府的支出就將大大的增加，這項支出唯有以增發紙幣來彌補，結果又將使現在的生活費用加速騰漲</p>
<p>至於公務員的待遇，從政務委員以至征收員，都維持在驚人的低微水進上。在國家危難的時代，政府對於所有的文武官員要求自我犧牲，貢獻國家，固屬允當。但是中國公務員待遇的微薄，已超出了人類忍耐力的極限，正在產生萬分惡劣的後果。士兵的待遇極度低落，他們常聽到他們的家屬日益窮困的消息，因此嚴重的影響他們的士氣。至於不能靠薪給來瞻養妻孥的軍官們，假使他們德行優良，熱忱愛國，他們就須以變賣他們全部的所有物，來維持一家的生計。但當他們沒有什麽東西可以變賣時，就不得不眼看他們的子女挨餓，或者利用他們的職位來貪汚，或則自殺。過去，不願玷　門楣而寗願自殺的大有人在，但也有許多軍官走入了貪汚的道途。〔下接第五版）</p>
<h3>丁惠康博士應邀播講　美風美雨　洛山磯城醫院林立市校肄業一律免費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨假合作電台舉行第廿八次星期日特別廣播，請甫自遊義歸來之虹橋療養院院長丁惠康博士播講「美風美雨」，茲紀錄其演講大意如左：</p>
<p>美國在第二次大戰後，爲世人所稱道，其實勝利初非倖致，自一粒槍彈以至人工血漿，一切均爲全國人民節衣縮食之結晶，美人謂勝利者厥惟血與淚，　非虛語。此次遊踪所及，達三萬英里以上，茲所述者，掛一漏萬，在所不免耳。吾人舟達舊金山，首觸眼簾者，爲金門大橋，矗立海中，雄偉不可名狀。過此即爲世界第一長橋Bay橋〔海灣橋），長凡七英里，寬度可容汽車六輛並駛，工程之大，可想而知。然造橋之經費，由商人募集而來，政府僅居監督地位。往時每輛汽車，過是橋者，各納費一元，自落成迄今，九年以來，已收得建築費之半數，今已减收每次爲五角。每日行駛車輛最多數達十萬輛，使人節省時間，俾從事社會之建設者，何可勝數，故斯橋之建設費，雖云龐大，而國家無形中之收穫，實不可以數字計，此彼邦官民合作之一例也。</p>
<p>四季長春好花怒放</p>
<p>舊金山初無是城，乃闢山建之，其馬路之斜度，常達四十度以上。百年以前，曾遭大火，全城毀其大半，然今日之她設，更爲進步，已蔚爲東西交通之樞紐。在百年以前，原爲荒漠漁村之洛山磯，今日號稱世界第一大城矣！位於舊金山之南約五百里，雄踞於太平洋之濱，其地雖爲沙漢之區，而四季長春，無嚴寒霜雪之侵。吾人以今年一月臨其地，好花怒放，如値盛春，故當人之築別數於此者，實　有徒，良以其氣候之佳，不可多得也。美國八大工業之電影發源地好萊塢，即在洛山磯之北部，其住宅區整潔情麗，蓋都市而公園化者。洛城四週皆山，附近海濱溫泉諸名勝，尤爲遊人必經之地。</p>
<p>居民幾乎人各有車</p>
<p>洛城面積雖大，而以新興故，居民僅約三百萬，但汽軍有一百五十萬輛以上，幾乎人各有車，於此不但可見財富之平均，同時亦可知一般智識體力之發展與交通之便利也。凡學齡兒童而不入學者，其父母須受處罰，凡市立小學以至中學，均可完全免費肄業。不寗惟是，即電車票及書籍等費，亦悉免除。以洛山磯而言，有四千所市立中小學，其課程除書木外，若木工，製磁，排字，印刷尤切於實用。胡適之先生謂一切專門學職，若須向外國學習，則我國火學敎育，顯未成功，故有改革我國大學制度之議，可謂語長心重。愚歷訪加州哈佛，康奈耳，哥倫比亞，波士頓諸大學，觀其沿革之歷史，各科之消長，要非一朝一夕之功，至於建築宏偉，猶其餘</p>
<p>美輪美奐儼然行宮</p>
<p>洛山磯市立醫院，可容三千病人，全屋落成僅八年，美輪美奐，巍然若行宮。其銘曰：「維護健康，乃人生之眞樂」；又曰：「公衆健康，乃社會問眞實之財富」；現此可知其耗費大量金錢，以建築醫院，完全爲謀人民之福利。綜觀仝院，並無　等病室，一律均爲平民病室。其建築之偉大，是稱世界第一市立醫院。美國大部份人民均能安居樂業，且亦均可免費進醫院，享受一切正確診斷與早期治療，俾能早復健康，而從事於生產，小之於家，大之於國，無不交受其益。此次出國，同行者有聖約翰大學生多人，雖均富有，但國人體格遠不如人，大多面黃肌瘦，至時隔半年，重復相遇一，則諸生面色紅潤，豐腴良多，我國烹飪號稱世界第一，不圖飲食之營養，乃完全失敗，於此可證。</p>
<p>不斷精求日新月異</p>
<p>所謂新醫學者，一言以蔽之曰：「檢査的醫學」。一個醫院常有X機十餘部，以及手術室十間以上，診斷，普及精進，故能日新而月異。如血液在心　問，循環潮流之動向，今可用X照相得之。又如肺癌以及肺癆，在昔以爲決無生望者，今可藉精密之檢査，而得正確診斷，可將任何一面之肺葉，完全用手術切除，病毒旣去，則健康可復，在紐約海濱療養院之外科部，即有施行肺葉全部除去手術者四十餘人，結果至爲佳良。</p>
<p>突飛猛晋絕非倖致</p>
<p>愚於臨行前，特訪何總長應欽曁夫人於紐約之長島，午飯旣竟，繼以茗譚，夫人曰：何以美國之醫師，往往一再紹介，甲而乙而丙而丁，而醫師並不處方，以處理余之所病？余答曰：大夏大學之校訓，不曰「公誠」乎？美國之醫者，對於夫人之病，公開硏究，誠懇服務，如此而已！綜觀美國建設之猛晋，絕非倖致，要皆基於高深之科學，健全之體格，團結一致，悉力以赴，蓋人民渚，國家之原子也，原子若瀕衰滅，則國家之建設何來。我國抗日旣已勝利，則抗病以挽救我垂弱之民族，自爲常今之急圖，深望海內賢哲，共起以赴。</p>

<h3>蒲立特訪華觀感　上文接第四版</h3>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>公務員　給的微薄，是目前中國腐敗貪汚的主要原因，這種貪汚現象非常普遍，決不能逃過公正觀察家的耳目。軍隊方面，貪污的方式很多，最簡單的就是吃空額。一個將軍他可以虛報超出他實際員額的百分之二十五，領取這些空額的　餉與配給品，把實物變賣，　餉則入自己的腰包，與分給得力的官佐。中國軍隊的實際兵員也許不會超過薪餉單上列名的百分之七十。中國海關人員的能幹和廉潔，在一九三七年以前是世界上要算數一數二的，但現在也流行着貪污。他們中間仍有不少</p>
<p>潔身自好</p>
<p>的人，但大多數都正等即會「揩油」。各色各樣的稅務征收員類多貪污。一個正直的中國商人應向政府納稅一萬元，如果他照數繳納，而不講斤頭，他的地位就非常危險，征收員堅欲勒索，他要把五千元納入私囊，而以二千五百元繳納政府。但是如果商人不皆納賄，征收員就要報吿他，誣他假造帳目，拖欠稅款三萬元。這樣商人就將喪失信用，而且還須化費金錢，長期涉訟。中國法官雖然　給極微，生計艱難，但大體說來，都能忍受痛苦，潔身自好。然而也有貪汚的法官，沒有一項微小的事情，不受貪汚的侵染的。在中國，中學，大學的文憑，必須經過登記的手續，於是登記人員就想出了各色各樣的藉口，不予登記，一直等到他們在每張文憑上揩到了一點油才肯照辦。</p>
<p>這些人，大部份　貪汚生活，現在遏止這種貪汚行爲的唯一可能辦法，就是給予所有的文武職公務員一個可以維持生計的薪金，並且將繼續貪污的人員一律槍斃。</p>
<p>但是政府提高公務員的待遇將增加通貨膨脹。</p>
<p>通貨膨脹</p>
<p>將提高生活費用，生活費用的上泓又將迅速地使加薪無濟於事，而貪汚仍難避免－－結果大家都得不到好處。中國如何能打破這惡性循環呢？</p>
<p>解決這個問題，祇有一個最後的答案，就是結束戰事。但是如果惡性循環使中國不能從事於有效的戰爭，那末，勝利又如何能够達成呢？</p>
<p>這裏，就需要美國出面來　助。我們能够從幾方而來擊破這個惡性循環，而我們所付出的代價，如果以我們在安全方面所獲得的利益來衡量，仍舊是微小的。</p>
<p>目前，中國方面最令人驚奇的事實，不在戰事或政治的領域裏，而在財政的範圍內。中國政府的支出數額，如果以現行匯率折合美金，簡直是微乎其　。中國政府在比美國大過三分之一的地區內，統治着四億五千萬的人口，而且担負着戰爭的一切費用，但是每年的支出，祇不過和紐約市政府的支出一樣。</p>
<p>中國政府一九四七年的總支出，按目前匯率計算，約等於十億美元，這是一項事實。從理論上講，幾萬億的中國法幣，按照目前匯率，祇須以二億五千萬美元就可全部收回，這也是一項事實。換句話說，假使我們願意負担中國政府一年的全部支出，——當然我們不會這樣做，理論上是能够辦到的，就是增加十億美元的支出。假使我們願意以金銀收回中國所有增發的紙幣，——當然我們不會這樣做，在理論上而非實際上，我們能够做到，就是以價値二億五千萬美元的黃金或白銀貸予中國。這些數字之重耍，祗有一個理由，就是它們證明了</p>
<p>有效援華</p>
<p>的問題，是在我們的能力範圍以內。我們力能擊破中國通貨膨脹的惡性循環，而無須弄得本身幾乎破產。</p>
<p>在我們繼續討論援筆問題以前，讓我們記住，戰爭不能單憑武力取勝，還須仰賴戰鬥精神，愛國熟忱，與政治上偉大的領導，以喚起國家所有的物質與精神力量，今天中國政治上的領導力是怎樣的呢？它有沒有喚起全國疲憊，飢餓的人民從事新的自我犧牲的能力呢？</p>
<p>在一九二八至一九三七年間領導中國從事偉大建設，以及領導中國英勇抗戰的人，就是現在的中國的領袖。現在很少有人懷疑行政院政務委員的正直，愛國熟忱與存心良好，或有些政委－像交通部長兪大維－的卓越才猷。但是一般對於政府的批評則極普遍。這是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>當今世界，沒有一個國家的人民，其失望的程度，有　中國那麽深切的。中國人民滿以爲一旦趕走了日本人，他們就可以獲得和平。他們決沒有想到，日本敗降以後，蘇聯立刻會企圖利用中共，來破壤他們國家的獨立與奴役他們，在一九三七年日本侵華的時候，中共似乎祗有勢力非常單薄的一　匪徒，侷處在陝西省的一隅。那時，共軍確實祗有三萬人，而共軍除了呌　宣傳以外，極少和日軍作戰，他們的軍隊大都用來襲擊國軍的後方和奪取國軍的武器，所以在一九四五年春間，共軍的行爲十分可　。</p>
<p>但結果共軍在對日抗戰　獲得了極大的好處，當國軍正在和　軍作戰的時候，他們却在擴充部隊，故當一九四五年八月十五日，日本投降的時候，他們約有三十萬武裝游擊隊分佈在　北各地，當時東北方面沒有共產黨的一兵一卒。但是蘇聯政府於日本投降佔領東北以後，就開始趕運中共人員進入東北，並且以日本的軍械，把他們武裝起來，在東北共軍不但微集了當地的農民，還招募朝鮮人，現在他們的實力已近三十五萬人。他們散處華北的兵力，約有四十萬人，組成小股游擊隊。現在疲憊厭倦與盼望和平的中國人民，都得到了戰爭，繁重的賦稅和不斷上漲的生活費用與死亡，他們願望和平。因爲他們得不到和平，他們就　責政府。各國人民在大戰結束發覺原來的希望都幻滅了以後，往往有轉而反對他們</p>
<p>戰時領袖</p>
<p>的習慣——邱吉爾與戴高樂的受人反對就是晚近的例子。所以在中國目前的情况之下，沒有一個政府能够孚合衆　的。行政人員的貪汚與無能益發削弱了政府的聲望。但是，除了共產黨徒和他們的同路人以外，即使是抨擊政府最激烈的中國人，也不曾說過蔣主席個人的不好。他們承認他對國家的貢獻，除了孫中山先生以外，決非近代史上任何人所能比擬的。他們承認他個人的淸廉正直與一心一意的赤忱爲國。但他們同時說，他見聞頗受限制，對於國家現時的種種，已經不甚明白，說他對於二十年前襄助他的一批老人聽信過甚，他久居重位，因此沒有人再敢坦白的和他說話，他的各種習慣和態度已經定型，而無法改變他的政策或　換他親近的幕　，所以他不能應付今日中國可怕的新問題。但「他應該由誰來代替呢」？對於道問題的回答，千篇一律的是：「沒有人可以代替他」。</p>
<p>那些愛　人士熱誠希望，蔣主席能夠實行下列許多。</p>
<p>改革事項：</p>
<p>一，陸軍將領的一半，與將級以外軍官的三分之一，令之退休。這是人們所認爲腐敗或無能，或兩者兼而有之的人物。</p>
<p>二，　汰陸軍員額的一半，第一，則除所有軍中空額，第二，遺　最低劣的不對。</p>
<p>三，　　的官兵，一律增加薪餉四倍，實物配給兩倍。</p>
<p>四，官兵待遇調整，獲得可以維持生計的　餉後，如再貪汚，一律予以槍決。</p>
<p>五，裁撤政府中所有駢枝與無用的機構，遣散所有不必需的公務人員。一般估計，這項辦法可以裁减現有文職公務員的三分之一。</p>
<p>六，給予留任的公務員一個可以維持生計的薪金，嗣後官吏貪汚，一律槍決。</p>
<p>七，政府停止經營工商業，因爲國有國營必將引起引用親戚，無效率與食汚等流弊。國豕現有的工業售予出價最高的人，並且眞正獎勵私人企業。</p>
<p>八，歡迎外資——要言行一致。</p>
<p>九，分散中央政府的權力，在長江以南的整個區域內，將武裝部隊的數額與軍事機構的　力，在不妨害國家安全的範圍內，削弱至最低限度，重新以權力授予文人省主席，准許各省政府將土地稅的至少百分之二十五直接收歸自用，並許其自行決定各省的地方計劃。</p>
<p>十，改革土地稅及其他一切稅收，規定嚴厲刑罰，要求征收人員的絕對廉潔。</p>
<p>十一，聘請外國專家，指導賦稅制度的改革，賦稅的征收，財政政策的修正，以及工業的建議　問題。</p>
<p>十二，強迫一切擁有</p>
<p>國外存款</p>
<p>或黃金的人士將外匯與黃金繳解國庫，如有錢人士企圖逃避選項辦法，或不肯繳納賦稅的全部，一律予以逮捕下獄。</p>
<p>十三，嚴務實施兵役法，富貴人家的十弟應與農民一視同仁。</p>
<p>十四，取消學生緩役的辦　，凡剿共戰爭中爲中共工作的學生，－現在學生總數約百分之五的共產黨徒及同路人，立刻予以　召，並且在派赴前綫作戰以前，施以感化敎育。允許愛國的學生，舉行此評政府的演講和組織示威遊行。</p>
<p>十五，在東北行政機構中，儘量錄用東北人。</p>
<p>十六，公佈蘇聯紅軍在東北暴行的事實，如姦淫擄掠等。政府因爲恐　蘇聯，過去一直禁止這種事實的發表。並且公佈政府手中關於中共服從莫斯科的許多證據。</p>
<p>十七，公佈自香港走私來華的各種事實，這種走私正使海關的收入，大爲减少。</p>
<p>十八，舉行十月與十二月的全國選舉，在民主憲法實施以後，在實際上與名義上終止孫中山先生於一九二四年制定的國民黨的「訓政」時期。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>這一種計劃無疑疑會獲得全中國人民的擁護，而且，倘使美國能給予芳干援助，此項計劃定能付諸實施。</p>
<p>一九四六年十二月二十五日國民大會通過的中華民國民主新憲法，將於今年聖誕節起實施。國民黨（執政黨）無疑必能獲得大多數的投票，而蔣主席也必能重被推選爲中華民國的總統，因此，不致巾斷政府的持續性，而</p>
<p>美國政府</p>
<p>現在就可以配合蔣主席的計劃，以結束戰爭，而使中國古舊文化重復走上和平的現代化途徑。我們應當如何進行呢？中國從事內部改革而無美國援助，或者美國雖有援助而中國並不從事內部改革，都不能解決維護美國重要權益的問題，也不能解決中國的生存問題。美國政府和中國政府必須同時來共同着手解決這一個問題。</p>
<p>對於這個問題，我們必須立刻在三方面着手：（一）經濟和財政方面。（二）軍事方面。（三）政治方面。鑒於問題的本質是要把每一個武裝的共產黨徒驅除於中國領土，所以我們在擬具一個明智的計劃時，唯有以結束戰爭所需時間的估計爲基礎。美國軍事專家認爲；由於在廣漠的山地區域圍剿遊　隊之困難，結束戰爭需時三年之久。在中國人民看來，則比較樂觀。但姑且讓我們贊同美國人的估計，提出一個三年計劃的梗概，同時估計一下此項計劃所需的費用。</p>
<p>（一）中國黃金及外匯準備，業已大爲减少，所以它必須保留現有的準備金額，以備最緊急時之用。在此後三年中間，中國需要輸入大最的美棉，烟草，小麥，石油，汽油，以及機車，鍛軌，卡車零件等大量機械品。</p>
<p>中國倘欲輸入上列各物，所需金錢將遠超其輸出品所獲外匯及世界谷地僑應的總額。因此，它必需要得</p>
<p>信用貸款</p>
<p>以購買食物，原料，和機械品等。據中美經濟專家的估計，此項必需的借用貸款，其最高數字常爲每年二億五千萬　元－這相當於歐洲國家所需經濟援助中的很小部分。讓我們把此項數字，姑且减削爲二億美元，則整個三年計劃中的此項預算，應爲六億美元的信用貸款，以供中國自本年狄至一九五〇年秋向美國購買物資之用。</p>
<p>中國倘把如此獲得的糧食，原料，和機　品出售於市，將有助於　止通貨膨脹的趨勢。軍隊和公務員裁减名額以後，留職的文武官員可能獲得四倍於今日的　餉，而並不產生通貨直綫膨脹的惡果，這對於戢止貪汚之風是至要的一件事。阻止史太林覇佔中國旣是中·美二國政府的共同任務，那末主張此項信用貸款的用途不應由中·美二國政府共同管理，是毫無理由的。中國方面，簽字聲請，而由美國政府的一個代表加以副署，方能取用該項信用貸款。</p>
<p>自從魏德邁將軍發表指責中國貪汚的公開聲明以後，中國</p>
<p>法幣價値</p>
<p>的下跌更為變本加厲了，因爲人們誤解魏將軍的聲明，表示美國政府已不再顧及中國的事情。除非美國政府能火速用行動和語言，表示無意容忍史太林　佔中國，否則通貨彭脹瞬即會像脫韁之馬，這是顯而易見的。中國倘欲抑制通貨膨脹，目前就需要我們所曾幾經考慮的貸款之一部分，約七千五百萬美元。二億美元，（即三年計劃中第一年支用者）除了此數所餘下的款項尙可等待國會的決定。這七千五百萬美元，或由美國國外救濟計劃支出，或由進出口銀行支出，或由其它方面供給，則必須於此後三十天丙借給中國，否則，我們在明年春天將要應付中國更大的惡性通貨膨脹問題　爲了要在三年計劃期間解決通貨膨脹，爲了要制止投機者，並維持中國國際收支的平衡，上述之外，另需一筆款項。但是這一筆款項也必須由中·美二國共同管理。在決定此款以前，我們必須堅持一項條件，即鼓勵通貨膨脹的某種腐敗風氣必須終止。</p>
<p>例如：中央銀行發放頭寸及信用貸款給若干其它銀行，此類銀行就把該款轉借於私人，用於似乎合法的商業方面。其中有許多人就利用借款，自黑市購買貨物，金條或美鈔，等到法幣一旦貶値，就乘機出賣，獲取法幣，接着以賣得的一部分款項償還貸款，剩下的就據爲已有。有權勢者因此致富，而中國一般的人民却受害不淺了。</p>
<p>對於專此種</p>
<p>投機行爲</p>
<p>的少數銀行家和許多借款人，中國政府倘有決心加以嚴懲，並澈底禁止，然後擬定外匯平準基金，方有　益。此項基金的用途必須要有美國政府的一個代表加以副署，而在投機行爲尙未戢止以前，此項基金不應設立。讓我們假定，中國政府對於投機商人一定能有念遽而有效的措置，則整個三年計劃之中，預定以一億五千萬美元作爲外匯平準基金。</p>
<p>現在讓我們談到軍事方面。我們必須牢記：在國會能開始考慮援華問題之前，總統應該宣吿廢棄一部分軍火彈藥，即速把此項廢棄的彈藥供給</p>
<p>東北國軍</p>
<p>因為他們的美式配備萬分缺乏着彈藥的供應。此項行動不能再事延宕了。倘使延宕的話，明年春天我們或將發現東北已成爲蘇聯的一個附庸國家，而共產黨勢將盤踞在戰前容納中國工業實力百分之七十的一塊領域，作爲征服中國其餘部分的基地。</p>
<p>據中，美二國權咸軍事家的估計，如欲驅除東北的三十五萬共軍，我們非但需要重新裝備已將美國武器用舊的若干師軍隊，而且還需要訓練並裝備十師美化的新部隊。除此之外，使東北的給養系統，自給養中心以迄前綫作戰士兵，必須澈底使之有效率，這也是很重要的。東北重要港口大連，已不能加以使用了，因該港由於雅爾達協定之故，現被蘇軍佔據着。因此，葫蘆島和秦皇島港口的改良，及至少一條鐵路的修復，將是至關緊耍的。像我們一九四四年在法國，所表現的成績，數百人才，他們即能以高度的效率處理這種問題。中國缺少此種人才，而且在中國軍隊消滅其貪污風氣之前，將美國物資轉手於中國人所辦的給養系統，將是一種浪費。美國人不能越俎代庖，指揮中國軍隊，但美國軍人能够而且應該管理東北的給養事宜。</p>
<p>華北問題</p>
<p>是　　遊擊對的一個問題，因爲該地的共黨並不據有大城市，主要的不過是壞擊者而已。應付這種局而，需耍輕裝的閃電式部隊，配備着吉普軍，小型卡車，小型武器，機關槍和七十五公分口徑的臼砲。據硏究這個問題的中美二國權威軍事家佔計，如此配備的二十個師，予以適當的訓練，供應，和指揮，一定能澄淸整個華北局勢的。</p>
<p>即使是最少量的空軍，在華北和東北的軍事行動上而將有莫大的帮助。我們有數千架棄置不用的飛機和飛機零件，自我國空軍觀點說來，已屬殘廢，但在中國看來，却是上等的物資。將此項物資宣佈廢棄而後撥給中國，並不費我國一文，不過是簿記上的一個項目而已。假使我們以原價一元作五分的價値售給中國，我們也已賺錢了，因爲這批物資對於我們是一無價値的。</p>
<p>有一件事情是很顯然的：美國對於三年計劃中軍事方面所需的總費用，將取決於我們如何處置廢葉的物資廢葉的武器和軍火除了當作廢錢以外，一無價値，假如我們要中國人以五分或一角來償付原價的一元，並以該項基礎估計軍事援助的總値，那末全部費用甚低，但在運輸石油，汽油，糧食，美國運輸人員的酬報，以及訓練和作戰時的顧問諸方面，則需耍化費相當的代價。在整個計劃具訂以前，我人無法加以估計，即使約略的估計也屬不可能。但若實行處置廢棄物資的辦法，那末每年的費用不致超出二億美元，整個三年計劃所需費用，也不致超出六億美元了。</p>
<p>再加上信用貸款六億美元及幣制基金一億五千萬美元，我們在三年計劃中的全部費用將爲十三億五千萬美元，即此後三年中，每年的費用爲四億五千萬美元。我們把這筆款項用作防止史太林</p>
<p>霸佔中國</p>
<p>並利用中國　源人力以反對我們的代價，那末所費並不太高。</p>
<p>但除非中國人能於戰塲　戰以外，還能刷新他們的政治生活，在全國鼓起一種新的精神，並且提高軍隊的士氣，否則上述一切援助不會發生什麽效果。我們能帮助他們如此作爲嗎？我們的建議是否將被當作毫無禮貌呢？它們不致於被認爲毫無禮貌，只要這些建議是山適常的人用適當的方法擬具的。假如這些建議是平等公道的建議，那末好像英國政府在珍珠港事變以前樂於接受我們的建議一樣，巾國政府也必同樣樂於接受它們。很多美國人顯得趾高氣揚的模樣，當他們到了中國以後，便把美國的勢力，威武，力量，和統治力，跟他們本身的人格混合起來，便在在瞧不起中國人，然而眞正以人的立塲而論，中國人却遠較他們爲優越，從歷史上看來，蔣主席較目前任何美國人類得更爲偉大。後世的人們將懷念蔣主席和邱吉爾都是富有勇氣的領袖，他們能在最黑暗的時期團結他們的國家，而中國的黑暗時期甚至較英國的更爲暗澹。我們倘要保障美國的重要權益並保衛中國的生命，美國人和中國人之間必須有最密切合作。然則那一位美國人具有軍事知識，政治技才和偉大個性，足以從事這一種合作呢？</p>
<p>今日我們在遠東有一位權威的將軍，他具有這種種質素。倘使杜魯門總統能派麥克阿瑟將軍於現有職務及權力以外。加上大使銜的總統私人代表的稱號，飛往中國和蔣主席擬訂一個</p>
<p>共同計劃</p>
<p>以防止蘇聯的征服中國，那末整個遠東將充滿希望而顯得一片光明了。麥克阿瑟將軍不必捨棄他在日本的工作。他能往來於東京和南京之間。在軍事經濟和政治等方面的建議或許和本報吿書所提出的相類似，他一定能很快地和蔣主席聯繫在一起，成爲同一戰錢上的二個同志。他們二位定能　弟兄那樣，爲了他們共同的目標而携手合作。</p>
<p>這目標是一個共同的目標。倘若中國陷入史太林的掌握，那末整個亞洲，包括日本在內，遲早將讓他吞掉了。到那時，史太林將動員亞洲的人力和資源，用以對付我們。美國的獨立也就決不會比中國的獨立多延續一個時代的。（全文完）</p>

<h3>華聯第五戰　大勝暹聯隊　七比一戰局成一面倒</h3>
<p>（盤谷三日航訊）滬華聯足球隊，昨在此作第五仗，與暹聯隊會師國家運動塲，觀衆益盛，約計二萬左右，華聯自對四大學聯隊後，塲地熟悉，鋒芒畢露，操縱戰局，結果以七比一大勝暹聯隊。</p>
<p>時間旣屆，球證馬氏執法，暹聯隊中堅阿鐵未到，十人應戰，暹軍先攻，於華聯城下鏖戰，高保正反鈎脫險，華隊反攻，三軍齊進，春華開角球落點甚佳，保正平頭一頂，首開紀錄。俄頃華隊又興師環攻，義臣龍海首失良機，李奎不甘，左角高弔，暹門將中計失守，成二比〇。嗣後華隊攻勢稍衰，無奈後衛鞏固，暹隊難復失地，終以〇比二落後於上半時。</p>
<p>易地再戰，華隊順風推舟，聲勢又盛，龍海三赴單刀會，空手而歸，暹隊逆襲，似有轉機，然曇花一現，即吿萎靡，龍海錦順先後殺入，立功而退，四比〇選隊一籌莫展，遂改變戰略，易攻爲守，然而詭計多端，龍海錦順均梅開二度，凑成半打，暹軍鴨蛋一枚，羞與惱併，果然異軍突起，素　突破重團，數前奏功成六比一，終塲前一分鐘，華隊又以迅雷不及掩耳之攻勢，猛進叩關頌汶使盡解數，難救刧運，保正卅碼處一脚直中紅心，七比一，未幾法定時間已至，華聯以七比一大勝暹聯隊，雙方陣容如下：</p>

<h3>八個研究所·十八年工作　平研究院紀念會報告（完）</h3>
<p>— 李書華</p>
<p>現在把十八年以來木院各硏究所的工作撮要報吿一下：</p>
<p>物理研究所</p>
<p>物理學硏究所的嚴濟慈，錢臨照，陳尙義諸位先生，從事光學及應用光學方面的研究。抗戰時期在嚴濟慈先生的指導之下，該所設計並製造了顯微鏡四百餘架，供給後方專科以上學校及醫院工廠之用，製造了水準儀與經緯儀一百餘套，供給水利機關及公務局之用，製造了石英振燙器一千餘具，供給各方無綫電台及無綫電製造廠與盟軍之用。又設計並　製照相饒頭，供照相及放射鏡之用。顧功　先生從事地球物理的研究，與資源委員會合作，用物理方法探測在雲南貴州煤，鐵，鋼，錫，鉛，鋅，硫黃等重要　床之備量。該所會派員測量我國各地重力加速度，已測定二百卅餘處。</p>
<p>鐳學研究所</p>
<p>鐳學研究所鄭大章先生，在抗戰以前便從事鐳學及原子核物理的研究，這是國內陳子核物理研究的開端。不幸鄭先生在抗戰時病逝。陸學善先生從事X光的硏究，用X光研究金屬的構造，鐘盛標先生硏究水晶構造與紫外光燈的製造。國府上年所公布的本院組織條例已經把　學硏究所，改爲「原子學硏究所」了。但是本院須得把人才與設備充實後方擬照改。</p>
<p>化學研究所</p>
<p>化學硏究所注重有機化學的硏究。周發岐，紀育　，王序，陳光旭，蔣明謙諸先生全是有機化學專家。在昆明的時期，該所特別注重實用問題，作了不少應用方面的硏究。</p>
<p>藥物研究所</p>
<p>藥物硏究所以化學方法提取國藥的有效質素，硏究其物理性質，化學性質，藥理性質，生理性質，然後再設法利用之。主特此項工作的便是趙承　先生。另一方面莊長恭先生利用化學方法從事合成的工作。</p>
<p>生理研究所</p>
<p>生理學硏究所會研究營養及國藥與生理之關係，現在朱洗先生工作，側重生連發育與細胞等問題的硏究。</p>
<p>動物研究所</p>
<p>動物學硏究所注重水產動物及昆蟲的調査與硏究。張　，沈嘉瑞兩先生主持水產動物的硏究，朱弘復先生主持昆蟲的研究。在抗戰以前該所注意研究海產動物，每年定期派員赴我國沿海主要地點如烟台，成海衛，膠州灣，廈門，廣東，以及荷屬東印度一帶採集標本，並就地硏究其生活分佈狀態。抗戰時期該所注意淡水動物的硏究。雲南的滇池，洱海，楊宗海等，全都調査過。</p>
<p>植物研究所</p>
<p>植物學硏究所注意植物分類及分佈的硏究。劉愼諤，林鎔，汪發　，朱彥丞諸位先生全是植物分類專家。該所歷年派員調査與採集的區域很廣，東及長白山；西至天山崑崙山，西藏高原，喜馬拉雅山；南至滇粵；北達蒙古；巾經太行山，秦　，伏牛山，巴山，黃山等處。抗戰時期該所對於西北及雲南調査更覺詳細。該所現有植物標本共計十五萬餘號。</p>
<p>中國西北植物調査所特別注重晨林械物的硏究。</p>
<p>史學研究所</p>
<p>史學硏究所的工作是考古與歷史兩方面。徐炳昶先生硏究古史，黃文弼先生整理西北科學考察團所得的材料，蘇　琦先生整理該所在陝西賓雞鬥雞合發掘所得材料。馮家昇先生硏究遼史及火藥發明沿革情形。王靜如先生硏究西廈史文，古代新疆，及隋唐社會。</p>
<p>統計十八年以來本院同人所發表的硏究論文調査報吿約有五首餘篇，本院及各研究所出版的叢刋，集刋，專報，報吿，彙編等刋物及書籍，約五十餘種，其中大部分是民國十八年至廿六年這一個時期的貢獻。</p>
<p>黃金時代回憶</p>
<p>回想民十八至民廿六這個時期，質是中國科學工作的黃金時代。常時國內幾個少數硏究中心，努力硏究工作，造成了很濃原的硏究空氣。中國科學家在國內所作的科學研究工作，發表以後，常引起外國科學家的注意，也常爲外國科學家所稱引。所以中國科學家爲中華民族增加了不少的光榮。方才說過本院同人在這個時期的爲獻特別多，這是我們是可以自慰的。抗戰發動以後，同人在內地各種不適宜的條件之下，仍照舊從事科學工作，同時並協助解決若干實用問題。復員以後，同人在經費困難生活艱苦之中，仍埋頭實騐室中，尋求眞理，這都是應當稱道的。</p>
<p>同事壯烈殉職</p>
<p>從抗戰到現在，我們的同事損失了好多位。動物學硏究所所長陸鼎恒先生，　學硏究所專任硏究員鄭大章先生，植物學硏究所硏究員鍾觀光先生，通信硏究員沈兼士先生，及美國葛利普先生，法國郞之萬先生，文書課課長安幹忱先生，會計課課長陳　先生，全是在這個時期前後病故的。不久以前，植物學硏究所採集員王漢臣，在大理點蒼山採集標本，失足墜入山溝身死，尤爲可慘。我們今天舉行紀念會，因而聯想到這些位先生。</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，我們各研究所的設備，算是很好的，但是現在比較的落後了。十年以來科學進步很大，尤其原子核物理研究的進步更大。驚天動地的原子彈的發明，便是原子核物理發展的結果。可是這一類的硏究，需要較大規模的設備，也需要較大數目的款子。本院十年以來，增添的圖書儀器非常的少，且抗戰時期原有設備受了相當的損失。所以我們的設備比較落後了。這常然也是全國各研究機關一般的情形。不過本院經常費不敷應用，臨時費離着够用差的很多，得到的外匯尤少，所以本院感覺特別困難。我們應當首先把十年以來未能增添的設備增添起來，抗戰時期的損失，補充起來。然後繼續向前努力，我們將來的成績一定還會更好。</p>
<p>今後研究工作</p>
<p>我覺得今後我國科學硏究工作，應當對於世界科學的進步，負起一部分應負的責任。科學硏究是工業建設的基礎。科學硏究恰如水源，工業應用恰如河流，沒有水源便沒有河流。無疑義的我們應該把中國作成一個工業化的國家，能够大量生產，大量製造，才能够在世界上獨立生存。但是這種工業建設，須得周科學研究工作配合起來，才容易成功，才能有進步。（完）</p>

<h3>抑平本市米價安定民生　決增加配米十萬擔</h3>
<p>俞部長來滬商定趕運贛湘剰糧　社會局召米商談話謀穩定市價</p>
<p>米價漲勢昨日更趨猛烈，上　不已，零售竟高達每石八十六萬元，迫近九關，致令全市人心惶惶不安，糧食部長俞飛鵬，爲此特於前日晚車來滬，業於昨晨八時抵此，當即會晤吳市長，洽商抑平米價方策。趕運贛湘剩糧。與市長昨稱：抑平米價漲風，決加配貧民工人配米十萬担，該項米糧係自江西河南二省運滬者，首批五萬担，日內即可運到配售云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於食米問題，社會局長吳開先氏，昨日下午四時，再召集本市米市塲各負責人談話。計出席米商張錫潮，胡文安，印福祥，徐明仁，胡咸鋼，楊文慈，以及民食調配會常務委員任顯羣，科長吉明　等十餘人。</p>
<p>首由吳局長報吿：近日米價猛漲，不但影響升斗小民之生計，抑且因此而發生擾及治安問題。爲謀社會之安定，故糧價念需平抑云云。繼由糧商胡文安報吿稱：「上海人口佔全國百分之一，本市過去之主要米糧產地爲　江蘇產米區，　安徽，　江西，　浙江，次要者爲湖北湖南等地。最近時間已至秋收，新　業已登塲，糧價本應穩定，但反趨猛漲，考其波動之原因：</p>
<p>上漲原因計有七點</p>
<p>一般物價高漲，影響產區米價。　中央在江蘇，安徽，江西，浙江，湖北，湖南，等地，實行征實征借征購，影響糧價甚大。　共匪向產區搶購糧食，如安徽省蕪湖，本爲皖省糧食集卸么區，最近有所謂崇沙帮（共匪組織），不論價格，儘先收購。　江西，湖北，湖南，產區，因交通不暢，致有礙食糧運輸。　本月份食糧營業稅即將開始征收。　近日本市谷米號門售情况，發現「扁擔帮」購米，其形跡似甚有可疑之處。　本市糧商有數萬包糧食待運來滬，但因交通困難，不克兌現。最後由吳局長希望各市塲負責人，協助政府，穩定市塲價格，並勸導客商，不再「扳持」，應以民食爲重。</p>

<h3>當局決採嚴峻措置　制止本市物價漲風</h3>
<p>國慶節前後，本市物價狂　，有關金融之　　紛傳，人心爲之惶惶。昨（十二日）據某負賣人表示：主管當局已決定採取嚴厲措施，十三日起，除經濟警察全部出動，加緊監視各市塲外，各有關機關，將協同一致，共謀制止物價漲風。關於經濟案件，今後破獲者，將加重處分，至製製造散播謠言者，一經查覺決予嚴辦。</p>
<h3>香烟熱銷貨盤升</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市勢，初關因有京漢回　貨轉賣，行情壓低，詎至九時許，同業需吸不弱，貨主　　，市氣復呈上　。中以價格較低之烟，各方搜吸尤暢，行情俱吿堅挺。</p>
<p>最後十支大英烟，比上日軋升十萬，老刀哈德門反跌十萬，舉商烟以大美麗金鼠銀行雙斧克雷斯百萬金紅人等繁銷貨，價均盤升，其他各牌升沉互見。</p>
<h3>日用品依然挺俏</h3>
<p>肥皂市面，以原料燒碱每桶漲至三千四五百萬，甘油美聽昂至五百萬左右，廠方因成本加軍，派貨消息沉悶，場內買氣濃郁，賣戶堅持，致行情步俏。結果除固本軋平，箭刀黃祥茂皂續漲一萬五千元，其他各牌上落微細。火油美麗鳳凰兩牌軋升五萬。洋燭火油市亦挺秀。</p>
<h3>受通天證影響　港內匯低跌</h3>
<p>﹝六日香港訊﹞上週金融市塲，充滿淡市氛圍，無論內匯，國幣，黃金，黃紙，市情低潮迭現，內匯國幣，淡風更勁。</p>
<p>國幣匯價下跌，除　中秋節後，國內市塲銀根的緊後轉寬。　內地游資又開始向外逃避兩點因素外，是通天證的恢復使用，內輸物資突增，需要外匯大增，這是表面的。裏面的是，國內游齊湧來，搶購進口物資，因爲香港洋貨，尤其是工業原料，和其他奢侈用品，比國內市價，差價普通有一倍以上的利潤。就算通天證的代價花上百分之七十，商人也樂意去經營。</p>
<h3>限制信用合作社　發行支票平議</h3>
<p>— 康遠壽</p>
<p>上月下句報載：「財政部爲取締不合法票據及維護銀錢業起見，通令各銀錢行莊，關後一律不准收受信用合作社支票，並咨請社會部層飭各信用合作社，遵照票據法規定，不得爲支票之付款人，其已發行之支票簿並飭即行收囘，同時咨請司法行政部轉行各級法院，對於以信用合作社爲付款人之支票，不得視爲合法之票據。「財部負責人並有解釋，謂「信川合作社非銀錢業渚，依票據法規定，非銀錢業者不得發行支票，依經濟緊急措施方案之規定，在京滬等十八地區限制增設行莊」云云。大概這一消息當非虛搆。財部通令果發，全國信用合作社將因此而遭受一番打擊。筆者爲愛護金融事業之　展，促進合作事業之推進，在理論上與法制上，均有必須闡述之處，期使上項誤解消失，合作事業與金融事業相得益彰，是乃本文唯一之初衷。</p>
<p>「合作」爲一種組織經營之方式；在現代經濟社會中，合作組織形態，可說介乎國營與民營兩種方式之間，也可說出乎公營與私營兩項組織之上。此中理由，可成專書，道裏不暇多說。合作組織經營之範圍，極其廣泛，現時各種公私企業，無不可以用合作方式組織經營之，而且我們相信，也惟有以此種方式組織經營爲最合理。近代各國，無論資本主義國家與社會主義和共產主義國家，莫不同時允許採行合作制度，這便說明合作組織方式不僅適用於各項企業之經營，並且普遍過應於各國與各種社會。我國早已採行合作制度，執政的國民黨，二十年前就把合作運動重視爲七大運動之一，竭力提倡。國父　敎就有農業合作，工業合作，交易合作，銀行合作（按即目前所稱之「信用合作社」）等等的提示，而後有三民主義的合作政策之推行，二十年來，各種合作組織幾已遍佈全國，現在正待合作業務之發展，使之經營順利而充實，得爲新的社會經濟之支柱，而謀舊的經濟社會之改造。現在我們政府的任何一部門，必須依照中央旣定的策略，扶持合作事業之推行；就是全國的任何個人，只須稍有改革現時經濟制度的志願，他也會一致的共同努力於合作業務之設展。今天國內任何一個合作社，牠的業務經營只要不是違反合作原則與合作法規，又無循私舞弊的勾當，我們沒有理由在牠的　務進跟上故意給以任何打擊，而且我們也深信沒有一個機關一個人，敢故意給以任何打擊。我們甚望無意打擊而事實上在打擊合作事業的人們，自覺起來，毋自陷於賽本主義經濟制度的舊　臼中，囘頭做個改造社會經濟的革命先鋒。</p>
<p>合作事業中的信用合作，就是經營存放款業務而流通社員間金融的一種合作事業。經營金融流通之銀行業務的信用合作社，換句話說，即是有特殊性的銀行，這就是　國父　敎所說的「銀行合作」，也是從前一般人所稱的平民銀行。合作組織原本是經濟弱者自力更生的組織，信用合作社也是一般經濟弱者自助互助自救救人的信用組合，這是一般平民自已的銀行。因爲他們是經濟弱者，尤感資金融通之迫切，更有組織信用合作社之必要。這足以說明信用合作社具有自然生長之趨勢。誰有理由可以說一般平民不當自力更生呢？誰又可以否認一般平民所組織的平民銀行一類的信用合作社呢？誰有理由說信用合作社絕非從事等於銀行的業務呢？凡眞是平民的自救運動，我想誰也不忍心給于打擊。至於財部負責人說信用合作社非銀錢業者，顯係一種錯誤的曲解，毫未了解信用合作社之內容實際與其任務及目標。如謂經濟緊急指施方案限制京滬等地增設行莊，但並未提及信用合作社。况該方案之頒行，意在穩定經濟，限制一般商業行莊投機操縱，而信用合作社即係安定大多數平民經濟之措施。今日之信用合作社，並無投機操縱之意識與能力，自根本不應在限制設立之內。目前還沒有聽到那一個信用合作社　亂市場，破壞經濟，却反而先看見了打擊信用合作社的命令。</p>
<p>近年國內公私行莊不　增加，信用膨脹，業務發達，構成畸形發展之趨勢，確已造成金融資本之洪流，並與商業資本，土地資本，官僚資本互相呼應，勾給圖利，以致生產沒落，物價高漲，經濟紊亂，社會崩潰之危機。此種現象之造成，固有其多方面之原因，但與目前方在萌芽之平民金　機構即信用合作社可說毫無干涉；相反的，毋寗稅是銀錢行莊應該負責之處較多。如仍以保陣銀錢業者之理由，而使現有各銀錢行莊，專有發行支票之權利，不許信用合作社社員使用支取存款最便利之票據，強迫一般平民祗能與普通商業行莊往來，此豈事無之平？</p>
<p>再就我國印　業者今日之業務而實，就事實論，迄今能與商業行荘發生往來者，非巨富，即豪商，非達官，亦　勢，至少當亦爲擊　爲利之一般較有力量的商人。銀行業務僅與社會上所相交往，廣大平民則望之而莫能入，尤其農工階層的人們更不知銀錢行莊的大門開在那裏，何能望其融通？此積金融專業，僅屬社會之高貴點綴，而無廣大民衆作其基礎由是乃發生一種危險現象即一般所謂地下錢莊應運而生。所謂地下錢莊，不過未經政府登記給照的行莊之通稱，其所經營之業務亦係金融流通之銀錢業者的業務；而一考地下錢莊經營業務之對象，純屬巾小工商業者及平民。多數中小工商業者及平民，苦無流通金　之機構，不得已而向地下錢莊通有無。此可說明社會先有地下錢莊之需要，而後有地下錢莊之產生。我們必須診斷了社會的病理，而後可望有對症的藥方；否則儘管壓追査對地下錢莊，而地下錢莊仍將不斷的產生。這事實，恐財部亦未必能完全否認。現在的信用合作社旣是國家法律所允許，也是當地政府所登記，當然不能稱爲地下錢莊；不過信用合作社的業務對象，正是從前地下錢莊所把握的中小工商業者與平民大衆。但這些業務對象者，同時他們自己成了信用合作社的主人翁，主客一體，甚爲融洽。經過了合作社的媒介，使中小工商業者和平民大衆間究金融通和利益分配的問題，都能同時得到合理的解決。中小工商業者與平民旣已融通有路，地下錢莊存在的原因可期其隨而消滅。而所有的信用合作社，再與銀錢行莊發生正常的業務關係，如此，已引導平民大衆進入銀錢行莊的大門，發生間接往來，也就是銀錢行莊有了廣大羣衆爲其鞏固的基礎，吸收了展大羣衆的游資，而使之流入正當的用途。上下可以會流，展大平民與銀錢行莊，兩得其利。這樣圓滿豐富的收獲，幾乎要全賴信用合作社做媒介。所以今天的信用合作社，不啻平民與行莊間的一座橋樑。這個理由，銀錢行莊必須深深地瞭解，發出扶助信用合作社的熟忱。現在，銀錢行莊的明達人土的確很多已了解這共存共榮的大道理，則管理金融業務的行政機構，財政常局　有不明白道個大道理的？所以笨者以爲，這個誤解當可望其立刻冰釋，財政部將一變其態度而也會扶助信用合作社的</p>
<p>現在再就法制方而來說明信用合作社就是銀錢業者，根本不受　據法之限制，可以發行支票。現在合作社法第三條第四欵規定：「爲謀金融之流通，實於生產上或製造上必要之資金於社員，並收受社員之存款。」此爲信用合作社之基本業務。又同法第五條規定：「經營第三條第四款之合作社，經主管機關之核准，得收受非社員之存款。」又現行銀行法第二條規定。「本法稱銀行榮務爲左列各種：一，收受各種存款，……三，辦理各種　款或票據貼現。……」又同法第十六條規定：「凡收存貨幣或款項爲常業者，不論其收存方法篇給予支票或存　或收據或　　或期票或其他類似之證明文件，均視爲銀行業務。」又現行票據法第一二三條規定：「支票之付款人以銀錢業者爲爲。……」查所列現行各法條，無論如何合併解釋，信用合作社均爲銀錢業者，至少亦應在「視爲銀行業務」之列。旣爲銀錢業者，當可依法給予支票。况支票爲契約票據之一種，信用合作社與存款戶雙方之契約票據行爲，只須變方當事人認可，即已發生效力，法律亦所不禁。而合作社法，銀行法，與票據法，均爲國府公布么法律，其解釋　責當不屬於財部。况合作主管機關在中央爲社會部，凡有關全國性合作事　之更張，必須商經社會部同意，會銜通行，方屬妥當。財部如果爲預防信用合作社發行支票之　　起見，亦應從速與社會部另行磋商，妥訂管理之方，斷非一紙片面的通令所能令人折服。何况支票使用之田　與否，及有無流弊，乃一般支票發行者之共同問題，決非信用合作社的單獨問題。難道財政部也可因某行謀莊的支票發生若干問題而就可通令所有銀錢行莊一概不得發行支票嗎？</p>
<p>綜上所述，今日我國政府對信用合作社之事務，不宜消極的加以限制或打擊，而當積極的　導走入正途，最好由社會財政兩部會商嚴格管理的辦法，使之母爲奸人所利用，而現今信用合作社的經營者，尤當自知警惕奮勉，以完成其任務。</p>

<h3>瑪琍馬</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>瑪琍馬者，馬瑪琍也；馬小姐的尊姓大名呌起來委實六不順口了，如果親熱的直呼之為瑪琍，則又與劉瑪　朱瑪琍無所區別，因爲現在的一班小姐們以瑪琍爲芳名的實在太多。常然她還有一個外國名字Mary　Ma，可是她的一班朋友們，類找者流，都覺得我國固有文化頗有保存的必要，因此，一個折衷辦法就應運而生，大家遂稱呼她爲瑪琍馬了。</p>
<p>不過，最初我們是呌她馬瑪琍的，後來不知怎麼個一來二去才演變爲「中學爲體，西學爲用」的瑪琍馬？那一點「靈感」起於何年何時？已經記不淸楚，所以這個有歷史性的日了也就無案可考。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>瑪琍馬正當綺年王貌。——年年四月十日，（當然是西曆）花香島語之春，我們都被邀請參加她的生日宴會，在她的精緻美麗的小客室裏，我記得我有這個光榮達五年了。她的胡桃蛋糕，可口的蘋果布丁，各式各樣的聰明的Game，玫瑰的笑，唱歌也似的嗓子……我都淸楚的不會忘記，使我弄不淸楚的是她的年紀，前年她告訴我她此她的妹妹大兩歲，但是今年愛琳馬又說她比她的姐姐小四歲，安娜蓓兒李說她大概二十六，露易絲趙又說她只有二十三，總之，雖然她的生日衆人皆知是四月十日，但是她的年紀是一個謎，這又是一點無案可考。</p>
<p>瑪琍馬生得很美，我們應史上有沉魚，落雁，閉月，羞花四個美人，但是瑪琍馬却不像中國人。她說過的：『喬治陳講我像Olivia　De　Havilland，弗曉得阿像？』我們當然義不容辭的大點其頭，凑趣的說像，在瑪琍馬之外再呌幾聲Olivia　De　Havillandland。敵僞時期，西片禁映，於是幾個日本明星也曾紅極一時，其中最美的要算高峰三枝子，有一次，瑪琍馬對我說：『有人講我像伊。」我忘了間她是不是喬治陳。一個讀初中的孩子也知道如果A＝B，B＝C那麼也一定C＝A，可是我看不出高峰三枝十和Olivia　De　Havilland有什麼相似的地方。</p>
<p>但是，不管二十三也好，二十六也好，瑪琍馬仍是年輕的。高峰三枝子也罷，Olivia　De　Havilland也罷，瑪琍馬總是美麗的。所以說：瑪琍馬正當綺年玉貌，這句話誰也不能加以否認。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>瑪琍馬是上海人，這一點雖也無案可考，但是有話爲證，想來不會錯。</p>
<p>關於她家裏的情形，我們不怎麼仔細：只知道她父親是穿西裝的，而且是筆挺的西裝，她母親的頭　是在理髮館裏包月的，他們不呌「阿爸」頭是「姆媽」，而稱Daddy和「媽咪」，她的大哥有許多外國朋友，二哥結婚在國際飯店，證婚人和介紹人都是赫赫有名的名流，名流的名字忘了，反正是名流就是了，愛琳的鋼琴彈得如何出色，她的弟弟在學校如何得到老師的「巴結」。……這一切，全都是瑪琍馬親口述及的。想來也不會錯。</p>
<p>她的精緻小客室裏，較遠供着鮮花，日暦每天都撕；從來不　小報，中文報紙據說都不大看，總是讀外國報；聽無綫電向來是西樂，連流行的中國歌曲都不愛總，更不用提彈詞和紹興戲了。逢禮拜天上敎堂聽道，雖然並不是基督敎家庭，但是他們吃飯總不忘記　告、　琍馬家裏的娘姨大姐也會說）聲「哈　」，每　電話鈴　，拿起耳機，總是不說「喂』的。這都是我親眼目睹，當然更不會錯。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>第一次看見她的時候，還是在學校裏，寒假期滿開學，註册那天，我們這一羣剛由新生變成了舊生，頗爲自鳴得意，於是指指點點的注意着那些剛考進來的同學！正像從前別人對我們一樣。</p>
<p>在那陰暗的甬道裏，大家眼睛一亮，原來有麗人行過，隆冬天氣，她梳着「舞宮風月」裏那個名呌Zaza的舞孃的髮型，外國紅的袍子，白　大衣，高跟鞋子在地上打得格格的響，她走得極快，我們竟忘了留神她的臉，只覺得脂香粉膩，一種雍容華貴的儀態，神聖不可侵犯。想起應該端詳一下時，她已姗姗的走進主任室了。</p>
<p>一會兒，兩個高班的男同學從主任室走出來，他們說着話，臉上現出極滑稽的笑容。</p>
<p>「喚，我知道她是誰、我的妹妹的同學的哥哥的朋友的一年前的情人……」</p>
<p>「廢話，乾脆她呌什麼名字？」</p>
<p>「她呌馬—」摸摸頭、「馬」不出來了。</p>
<p>「她呌馬？」</p>
<p>「啊，她呌馬瑪琍。」</p>
<p>「唔，人如其名，她應該是馬瑪琍，不過，這樣的人應當讀社會，或是英文文學，爲什麼念政治系？」</p>
<p>「為什麼不能？你的想法多奇特？招出率上並沒有這一項規定。」</p>
<p>「　她那樣的人……」</p>
<p>「女人是天生的政治家，你忘啦？尤其像馬瑪琍那樣的女人，更是一們出色的政治家。」</p>
<p>「你是在侮　政治家？還是在諷刺馬瑪琍？」</p>
<p>「都不是，不過馬瑪琍，她——」</p>
<p>「哦，Mr．王，」驚一樣的呌喚，馬瑪琍從主任室出來了，趕上前握手，一臉的笑，友善，「他鄉遇故知」般的歡喜：「我一來就尋儂，還有儂格Miss．蔣；　令妹好　？長遠嘸看見伊，傎正牽記……」</p>
<p>那個Mr．王半回過頭，也是一臉笑，却有點兒尷尬，不自然。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>至於我跟她熟悉起來，却是這之後一年的事情。爲了同續「民法」，我有幸和瑪琍馬。坐在緊鄰，我們的民法敎授是一位老先生，常常身體不好缺課，又常常法院裏忙而不來，所以有幾個鐘點，我得以不聽那枯燥死板的民法總則和分則，而和瑪琍馬聯天，從她那兒，我知道許多　去我不知道的事情，以及書本上沒有的知識和技能，例如：什麼樣的臉蛋兒應該梳什麼樣的頭髮，絲襪　過來穿比正着穿　得　子質地好，皮鞋是那一家的好，那一家照相館拍得最好，國泰戲院的外國女領票員沒有大光明樓上的「趣」，做蛋糕的時候多少麵粉應該擱多少水，一項男人的舊呢　可以製成一副冬天用的鞋罩，不要在跳舞的時候吃口香糖，……一舉年過去，我的「民法」得到四個學分文外，又吸收了許多「舊本以外的學問」，雖然我太不肖，不能够學以致用，但是想起不似先前那樣孤陋寡聞時，飲水思源，我是衷心感謝瑪琍馬的。</p>
<p>尤其應該銘感於心的，就是她幾乎全部無條件的敎我這些個事情。自然起初也有個互惠的交換，她跟我說過：「國語說話好聽來，明朝起，儂做我格國語先生好呢？」</p>
<p>我特地買了一本曹禺的「正在想」，好念起來有趣一點兒，但是不到三天，瑪琍馬緊鎖起柳葉雙眉：「難讀來兮格　，舌頭捲大不來。」於是我換了一本「湖上的悲劇」，因爲沒有北方土話，瑪琍馬又道，「裏廂有鬼格　，怕來，夜裏要做夢，嚇煞快。」我又換了「雷雨」，她說：「傎作孽，弄到末脚，人統統死光，苦是苦得來。」她的這些意見使我爲之驚奇不已，原來瑪琍馬就這麼淺薄？不過，我只是她的國語先生，而非國文先生，管這些個閑事作甚？</p>
<p>然而到底一本書也沒有讀完，我們的「國語課」就壽終正寢了，因爲她旣那樣的「英雄氣短」，我又何必「自作多情」呢？</p>
<p>瑪琍馬對於外國的一切，不止是迷信，簡直熱戀，瘋狂的熱戀，「月亮是外國的好一，固然是天經地義，其實就連灰塵和螞蟻在瑪琍罵的心目中也是舶來品勝似國產。中國的電影公司拍不出好戲，中國的裁繼只會做千篇一律的旗袍，中國貨的料子花樣十九鄉氣，中國的小孩成年拖着鼻涕，中國的老太太手上拿念佛珠而不拿聖經和十字架，中國的情人們在街上連路都不會走，很少有一兩對像外國人那樣Smart的，不是女的扭扭捏捏，就是男的　兇極惡；……總之，中國樣樣都不好，除了有一個瑪琍馬。</p>
<p>聽說留學生比洋入還要洋派，瑪琍馬可比留學生更要洋派；她吃三明治，大餅油條看也不要看，咖啡和龍井同樣帶點苦味，但是前者苦得有味道，後者苦得沒道理；她從不看中國電影，連高尚的話劇都不要看，沒有西片的時候，她Opera是聽Concert，看不懂也要看，聽不懂下次還是聽；她是Coty和Max　Factors的老主顧，誰要是抹了蝶霜，瑪琍馬的俏臉兒立刻扮起一個怪可愛的討壓表情；「　來」。她平時嘴裏常愛嚼口香糖，巧克力，大概也是跟美國女孩子學來的，她的大衣式樣，連靜安寺路一帶的外國店家都少見，因爲瑪琍馬是超時代的，她的衣服是外國電影中女主角和外國畫報裏女模特兒的「結晶一，採取了二者之精英而特製。</p>
<p>此外瑪琍馬尚有一隻愛犬，那隻狗的國籍不詳，但是他的祖國絕不是中國，我是敢斷言的，狗的芳名西琍，按照中國的排行　琍應該肯瑪麗是姐妹，不過東風從不西漸，那麼這一點誤會自然不會發生了。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>假使我這是為瑪麗作傳的話，有三件事是不應該不提一下的。</p>
<p>好像是我們讀大三那年，剛開學，聊天的時候大家談起這一學期所修的課程，一個同學說：（今年傎難念，本本書都是原文的」。</p>
<p>瑪琍馬一臉的奇異：「全是原文格？格未「中國哲學史」哪能可以——」</p>
<p>那一個死樣怪氣的道：「的確是格，「中國」哲學史也是「原文」格」。</p>
<p>我們全都爲之啞然了。——這是第一件事。</p>
<p>還有一件使我不能忘記的，那時我們已經畢業，某一個週末的午後，我陪着瑪琍馬在貝當路美國敎堂門口會晤兩位男同學，接頭一些關於級會裏的事情，瑪琍馬和他們約的是四點，我們到那兒是三點五十五分，不料那兩位男同學竟姗姗來遲，於是瑪琍馬大爲不快，扯了我就走向高恩路，折到體飛路去散步，她生氣的嘰咕着：「個種boys哪能弗　道理格？搭人家講好四點鐘，倒喊人家等伊拉」。她好整以暇的散步，談心，達半們時辰之久，天忽然下雨了，才呌了一部三輪車夫敎堂，老遠她看見那兩個遲到的傢伙站在門口，立刻關照我道：「喏，看個兩個人，傎要把點苦頭伊拉吃吃；等一息看見仔，弗要講伲業羅來過」。我當然謹遵台命。三輪車在敎堂前俘下了，瑪琍馬現出長於交際的表情，跳下車，說：「傎抱歉，伲有一眼眼事體」。那兩位速說「沒關係，只有一息息」。我看看手錶，四點三刻，他們的衣服被雨淋濕了，我們多花一次三輪車錢。</p>
<p>有一次，瑪琍馬請我們吃「下午茶」，竟破例有一樣中國點心，我高興的嚷着：「瑪琍馬，這個傎太好了，我頂愛的銀絲捲。」</p>
<p>瑪琍馬連忙把銀絲捲的盤子也送到我跟前：「媽咪新掉仔一個飯司務，伊從前是梁園裏廂格。」</p>
<p>我說：「對了，梁園，怪不得做得這應好，那是一家河南館子。」</p>
<p>瑪琍馬搖搖頭：「啥個河南湖南，我纏也繼不靈淸，中國格地名總歸個種樣子，儂看人家外國地名，讀起來幾何便當。」</p>
<p>我覺得最最便當的還是光吃銀絲捲，不跟她嚕嚕囌囌的惹氣，所以不開口了。——這是第三件事。</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>最近，許久不看見瑪琍馬了，聽說不久她將和剛從美國回來的亞力山大丁結婚，亞力山大丁我沒有看見過，只聽說他不是上海人，我盼望他別是什麼河南湖南或是河北湖北人，否則，瑪琍馬對於中國格地名旣然繼不靈淸，那麼亞力山大工的故鄉景非將和茜琍的祖國一樣的無案可考了麼？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這位老實人繼續他的分析：</p>
<p>「您那任務番號，大概是個「七」………對不對？再不就是一個約定的暗碼，——門外是個『七』，您這間屋子又有個『七』——雖說是二十七號，也許就爲那七號，十七號，三十七號都早有人住着。……這可是鄙人胡猜着玩的；說不定是一種巧合罷了……可是……</p>
<p>「可是，　大概還沒十分明白天津這兩天的嚴重情形；除了鄙人這條惡狗，是個玩兒票的性質之外，日本的軍，特，憲，警，動員了幾千人，四下兜捕「反日」份子。像那位小同志追去探聽的那種事情，一天少說也有兩三件，四五件；並不希奇。可　還那麼堂而皇之，在牆上裝起暗碼來！……您也許有什麼特別把握，沒把日本特工看在眼裏，鄙人也替您揑着一把汗咧……</p>
<p>「關於剛才門口過去的那幾位，鄙人也有幾分認識。他們的機關，工作，我都知道。不過鄙人要說一句老實話：他們眞是一些「初出世的犢兒」，胆大包天，………剛才我追上去，給他們一個警告，還被他們彈了回來，給鄙人一個下不去；傎呌人有些好氣又好笑；正合着文人說的、『哭笑不得』………「啼笑皆非！』………」</p>
<p>這位「它」長篇大論，滔滔不絕，說了這麼多，始終沒聽見　羣開口；通「　」，「呀」，「嚷」，「啊」，「咦」，這些驚　符號，都不肯輕易放下一個；至於「是」，「不是」；「對」，「不對」，之類的肯定用語，當然更不肯出口了。這未免顯得有些「拙」，至少也有些不近人情或示弱的冷靜不是嗎？然而這種冷靜，豈不也是一種表情？這種無表情的表情，從對方這位「它」看來，至少也可以把耀羣的底子，斷定個一二三點，不是嗎？</p>
<p>不錯，耀羣始終在聽，始終保持着一片寗靜。眉宇之間除了一片寗靜之外，僅有稍稍顰起他的眉尖，透出了一絲絲好奇的表情。她的姿容，本來就是一個美的型，面部輪廓，天然就像經過高手彫塑過似的。眼，眉，口，鼻，耳，頰，上額，下額，恰好都合條件，恰好都在部位上。尤其是口唇的一部份，這時在寗靜的條件下，雖是抿着的，可是抿得很自然，嘴角稍稍翹起了一些，表顯了一個「甜」字，甜的十分可愛。</p>

<h3>突變是化學性的改變嗎？</h3>
<p>— 郝天和</p>
<p>遺傳學裏的突變，假定是由於一種化學性的改變而發生的，那麼這種改變一定發生在染色體上的許多因基裏，至少有一個因基，發生了變化。這個突變的因基，往往和一般的因基同樣的穩定。所謂穩定就是牠能產生和牠同樣的特變因基，而開始一個新的遺傳系統，大家相信，如果沒有時變，生命就決不會演進到超過牠最原始的出發點。但是其中重要步驟的機械方法，事實上還是不知道。自從密勒氏（H．J．Muller）利用人爲方法如X光綫產生了突變，對於突變間題，開關了一條新的途徑，而且有關這個問題的許多新事實，也慢慢的露出曙光。X光綫可以使染色體破裂，當道種分裂下來的許多斷片重新連接起來的時候，就可以發生一種變化，很像自然界中的突變一般。至於那種光的輻射的質量和突變的形式以及出現率之間的相關的法則，也已經發現，並且所需電離的數目，以及那種敏感因基體積的大小等等，都可以推算了。可是因基突變和染色體破裂的實際狀况到目前還是和以前一樣的不可思議。</p>
<p>X光綫對於染色體具有破壞性的，而且牠的破壞力是相當利害，這是可以想像的。如果用別種緩和的方法去產生突變，也許可以更淸楚的看到其中有關的步驟。自從發見紫外光綫，也能產生突變之後，關於道一方面，已經有了一種進展，凡是那種有效的波長對於核酸及某種蛋白質成分的光帶，吸收限度，雖則有時可助於分析特變的步驟，硏究放射能的遺傳學家，已經指出產生突變的第一個步驟，是在染色體的某種構成分子吸收了一個能量子。但是祇靠波長並未發見很確實的效果，紫外光綫和更短的光彼如X光綫和卡馬光綫（r-ray）的作用之間有何差異，現在還未明白，但是在分析突變的步驟方面，或有帮助的。</p>
<p>凡是化學藥品能引起突變的，用來作爲探討突變的工具，應該是有特別效力的。照我們所假定，突變是由於一種化學的變化，那麼，對於那種化學藥品，如有充分知識，不但能够明際化學藥品本身的作用，而且也能够了解因基的性質。而且在試用的過程里，可以希望找到若干化學的突變素（Mutagens），牠們對於某種個別的因基，也許有特別的　力。如果發見了這種物質，不但在理論上可以引起濃厚的興趣，而且可以開　一條等待已久的途徑去產生突變。換言之，突　可出人力來控制了。</p>
<p>探求化學突變素的工作已經繼續進行了二十多年，爲了試探這個目的，科學家所選擇的物質，是多方面的：如碘，氨，金屬化合物，以及多種卡新諾精（Cnrcinogens）〔註一〕這些是許多被實臨的物質中的發個罷了。可是所得的結果，都很顯明是負的，就是到了一九四零年開始作試驗的時候，還沒有得到顯明的正的結果。這就表明一種化學的突變素，一定具有特殊的性能，牠要挑逃因基裏的特種物質來起作用，而且同時不能破壞含有那種物質的細胞本身，所以在沒有找到一種　合的有效的物質之前，祇好用許多物品來作試騐，到現在還在綱續要求着，從　種硏究的記錄看來，都在指示各種生理悄况，如年齡，性別，饑餓和因子式的本身，對淤突變的影響。如果由生物本身所發生的化學情况，能够影響突變的步驟，那麼，從外面加入化學物質之後，也有可能得到同樣的結果。</p>
<p>芥子氣能够阻礙細胞的分裂。根據這種事實，所以有人採用牠來作這類的試騐。不過芥十氣和X光綫同樣會灼焦細胞，而不易治愈，即使恢復，仍有破裂的傾向，此外又發見那種割了卵巢的老鼠的　這的表皮組織，在芥子氣的稀溶液裏沒過之後，細胞的有綫分裂作用，就要停止，而且分裂作用的停止，要總續數星期之久。本來那種組織裏的細胞如果受到蛋黃素（Estrogen）的刺激，還能保持正常的分裂。大家知道，經過X光綫輻射之後，能使染色體破裂，而重新組合，同時又阻礙了細胞繁殖的能力，其原因一半是由於有綫分裂，受到機械的擾亂，一半是由於細胞的死亡。那種細胞雖然已經把染色體的斷片組成新的染色體，分配到子細胞裏去，但是子細胞並沒有接受到一套充分的和正常的染色體，結果遂致死亡。所以芥子氣和X光綫一樣，也有可能對於染色體有直接作用，而阻止細胞的分裂。</p>
<p>一九四零年的秋季，科學家開始試騐芥子氣是否能够產生因基突變，和染色體改組。他們所用的材料是果蠅，先把果蠅放在一個對閉的室內，充滿了芥子氣，後來放在一個容器內，再抽出其中的空氣和芥子氣，最初的結果，似有成功的徵象，雌雄雙方，都變得不能生殖，其受害的程度，須視所用藥量的多少而定牠們生殖力的所以消滅，可以我到兩種互不相關的原因，因X光綫而起的絕嗣現象也會有這兩個原因：第一是配子的產生被阻止了，所以沒有卵或精蟲可以再供利用。第二即使卵已受精，而成爲合子，合子的死亡率相當大，更重要的結果是在正常的雌果蠅和已經被芥子氣　過的雄果蠅交配之後所產的卵，死亡率也很大，最適當的解釋大概因雄果蠅被　過之後，牠的精蟲並沒有喪失活動力，不過芥子氣好像X光綫那樣也可以使　蟲的染色體破裂和改組。</p>
<p>要確實證明芥子氣對於染色體所發生的作用起見，就該應用遺傳學的方法，去探察突變，可使雄果蠅與未黨過的雌果蠅交配，再检查牠們子二代中有無突變發生。早期的突變研究工作，以及新近的有關遺傳方面的研究工作，都沒有　用果蠅來做實騐的透澈，都遭受到困難，不能消除大部分人爲的錯誤，因爲一個有訓練的硏究者，可以指點出幾種變態，可是這種非常的性質，往往被經驗不足，觀察不確的人所忽略過去。在硏究果蠅的遺傳，這種主要的困難已經被密勒氏所設計的方法去除了，如果沒有那種方法，輻射能對於遺傳的定量分析，便是不可能。那種方法的要點，是祇限於探求致死突變，（Lethal　mulation）。這種突變能阻止個體的發育，所以要看有無致死突變，祇要在全羣果蠅的子代裏檢查一下，無論是存在或不存在，是極容易分別的。這們方法可將個人的錯誤减到最低限度，同時可以檢查大批的標本，而不致太費精力。如同著名的CLB試騐方法，對於大規模的測驗特別有用。那種方法是用來測騐性連致死因基。這種致死因基是位於性染色體上，雄性的祇有一個，而雌性的郤有兩個，一個性連致死因基在雄的性染色體上，就能阻止雄的發育，而這個因基通常並不嚴重的去阻碍雌的發育在CLB試騐裏，每條被處理過或被控制的性染色體，最後在子二代的全羣果蠅裏，都會顯出來。假若性染色體上發生了一個致死因基，那羣果蠅一定全部是屬於雌性的。當然這事實就是沒有訓練的人，也很快的可以觀察到的。</p>
<p>第一次用芥子氣做的CLB試騐，是在一九四一年四月裏開始的。結果很有可觀，出乎預料之外。性連致死因基的自然產生率，在實驗室裏所飼養的動物是很低的祇達到百分之一，但是經過芥子氣處理之後，性染色體上的致死因基竟會達到一千三百分之九十，這表示突變率佔百分之七强，如果沒有經過芥子氣的作用，在同樣數目的染色體上，祇發見三個性連致死因基，這表示在正常情形下的突變率，僅佔百分之點二，從前用X光綫或其他高度的輻射能，也曾經得到過同樣的結果，繼續的試騐，完全證明這是事實，甚至超過第一次的結果。竟然達到百分之二十四的致死因基率，更高的百分比，恐怕也不會發生了，因爲突變率愈增加，絕種率也變得愈加厲害。（未完）</p>
<h3>奇妙的花粉</h3>
<p>— 孫加另</p>
<p>我們四週的空氣裏飛揚着各種各式的花粉，雖然肉眼不能窺見，其中都蘊藏着有機的生命。這些雄性植物正乘着風兒，追求它們朱來的幸福呢！不論這種飄颺祇有一呎遠，或者遙達數百哩外，它們懷着同一目標——到達同種的雌花而配合起來。</p>
<p>假使沒有花粉，植物不再結實，花草枯萎了，我們也不能吃到各種的水菓了。</p>
<p>雖然蘊藏着無限的生命力，這些花粉却如風中殘燭般的脆弱。渴死和餓死是常事。就是一滴露水也足以制它死命，因爲花粉粒遇水膨脹而破裂，精細胞直接受到紫外綫的照射，即刻就喪失了生命，一粒玉蜀黍的花粉在自然環境下最多生存三十六小時。能够支持幾個月的，祇有極少數的　樹花粉。</p>
<p>顯微鏡下仔細觀察起來，各種花粉都有雪花般的整潔，竇石般的形式，和出奇的瑰麗。這些微妙的細粒就是最大的南瓜花粉也祇有百分之一吋厚，而在生長阿爾卑斯山（Alpes）上的毋忘我草花粉要小一百倍呢！</p>
<p>近北極孤立海洋中的格稜蘭（Greenland）大島上並無松林，但是生物學家却在該地發現了松花（松樹的花粉）。出乎意料的離開格稜蘭最近的松樹竟遠在四百哩外的拉布拉多（Labrador）這輕盈的松花竟能遠涉重洋，飛揚四百哩外咧！</p>
<h3>新元素</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>在沒有談新元素以前，先將原子的構造略加叙述。在十九世紀初達爾頓（Dalton）以實騐方法證明物質爲由稱爲原子的微小質點所構成。</p>
<p>後來終過許多年，許多科學家的硏究，才得到了　干是一種複雜的質點構成的電子·質子·和中子。電子是帶有陰電荷之微小質點質量爲9.035×10-28克每一元業原子核的外聞都環繞着不同數量的電子。質子是帶有與電子相等電量的陽電荷的微小質點，質量爲電子之二千倍。中子是由電子和質子嚴密結合而成的中性質點，質量與質子同。原子核是由質子與中子所構成，其所帶電荷依質子而定，質量爲質子中子質量之和，也就是原子的質量。</p>
<p>我們知道原子可分爲二類一爲放射性原子，一爲穩定性原子。放射性原子能放出LB與r等計綫L質點即是氣原子的原子核，是爲二個質子與中子所組織。另一種是似光速的電子。B射錢是由中子變成質子時的產生物，r射綫是一種波動輻射或爲高能的光子。</p>
<p>目今新元素的產生，都是由L質點或中子去轟擊原子核而成，而原子的轟擊技術，最初是羅漱福德（Rutherford）利用放射性物質放射出來的L質點去轟擊原子核，而射出質子。由此可知原子可用人爲方法轉變而成另一種原子。</p>
<p>鈾元素就屬於放射性元素的一種，有一種同位素原子量爲238，假使以中子射入鈾238的原子核後，就蛻變而成鐐（Neptunium），原子序爲93性活潑，故壽命非常短促，鐐如經過B射綫的轉變而成爲　（Plutonium），原子序爲94，在一九四一年已被發現了它有與　同樣的分裂特性，有與　差不多的放射性，它可以變成鈾235而放出L質點。</p>
<p>鈾之變成新元素，是由中子射入原子核後，鈾核之質最即增加而呈不穩定性，便放出一個B射綫。這個B質點是荷有一陰電，爲原子核中的中子變成質子時所放出之電子，於是核中多一陽電荷之質子，就使它的原子序從92，變至93而95餘類推。</p>
<p>但將L質點去森擊鈾的原子核時，又有許多新元素產生，像原子序95的（Americium）譯作銖，96的Curium紀念居里（Curie）而譯成鋸，還有一種元素97（Berkalium）譯爲鈸，將來原子物理化學愈進步，新元素的發現，將愈多了。</p>
<h3>人控飛彈</h3>
<p>— 辰福</p>
<p>平時，敏感的軍人往往要想像第三次大戰究竟是怎樣的一種戰爭。美國海軍中校邁克靑（Keith　McCutcheon）在六七月號海軍雜誌上發表了一篇關於受人控制的飛彈的文章。如第三次大戰是有相當長的時間的話，這種武器可能成爲勝敗的主要因素。</p>
<p>邁克靑說，當一次大戰將要結束時，往往至少有一種新武器的發明。但常因成功太晚，不能發揮它的威力。飛機在第一次世界大戰中僅不過是試用的，而在第二次世界大戰中就成了主要的武器。而在第二次大戰中的新武器，最有發展的就是德國的V-1和V-2火箭。（原子彈在軍入的目光中並不是完善的武器而祇是一種高度爆炸物，現在要用飛機運到目標地，將來可能用受人控制的飛彈來運送）。</p>
<p>火箭在這次戰爭中雖破壞了很多的建築物，但並不是因爲它而戰勝。邁氏說，火箭仍是不完善的武器，因爲它有幾個最大的缺點，就是它不能由人引導，落地後又不能受人控制。嚴格說來，火箭不是一種受人按制的武器，至多不過是一種長距離砲彈而已。</p>
<p>現在每個强大國家的科學家都在用盡心智想法去除這們缺點。邁氏說，他們正在硏究　理學上的定律，找出一種適宜於作爲導引火箭用的。電視，熱，光和聲都有被應用的可能。磁，電，和重力也都考虛到。那一國先解決這一問題就佔優勢。</p>
<p>邁氏又說，動力是不成問題的。在原子能動力還不能被應用以前，各種反動力引擎都可以用來推動火箭。　者通的反動力引擎就是噴氣渦輪引擎（Turboict　Engine）。這種噴射引擎的前面是一個空氣歷縮器，空氣被抽入前部，和燃料混合燃燒，成爲高壓混合的氣體，以每小時一千哩的速率從尾部噴出，牠的反動力就使火箭前進。而氣體在尾部設有衝出時，使渦輪轉動，這又使壓縮器繼續工作。</p>
<p>型式比較簡單而有發展的火箭是飛筒式火箭，它並沒有活動的機構。不管是渦輪噴氣的或是飛筒式的火情都不能到高層空氣以上。因爲在高空飛行的飛彈必須和V-2樣本身有火箭馬達和裝帶　氣。</p>
<p>裝有噴射引擎或火箭馬達引擎（或兩種况合的）的受控制的飛彈將出現於第三次大戰，而能有每小時數千哩的速率，這些在工程師們已不表疑問了。但問題在怎樣引導和控制，邁氏對這提出幾種可能的方法。</p>
<p>最簡單的飛彈根本不相控制，正像所有V型武器一樣，它們對於飛進路綫中的目標可像鬧鐘樣地預先設置。受人控制的飛彈是由地上船上或飛機上用無綫電波指揮的。一路上能測知本身是否循着指定的路綫進行。接近目標時，速率更大，如目標物有聲光熱等波發出，那麼飛彈就能依照下降，沒有不命中的。</p>
<p>現在受人控制的飛彈，還沒有幾種是超過設計階段的（如海軍的「蝙蝠號」和「飛島號」）。但邁氏已預言說這種飛彈再經相當改良就能在下次戰爭中應用。有幾種飛彈有很大的飛航力，如果再裝上原子彈，那麼敵人的任何城市都要被摧毀。因爲這種轟炸沒有絕對準確的必要，如要炸燬敵人某一轟炸機，可以不用原子炸彈，只要裝上普通炸彈就行。將來飛彈的放射法改良以後，我們可以看見一隻航近敵人海岸的巨大潛水艇上飛彈紛起，好像飛島出節。</p>
<p>邁氏以爲攻勢就是最好的守勢，但他知道美國決不曾學日本的偸製珍珠港，所以他說美國必須有一種飛彈，能於極短的時間內起飛，抵抗敵人的飛彈。</p>
<p>邁氏最後又說，營報最需要改良，因爲飛彈的速度可遠每小時三千哩，每過一分鐘就接近五十哩，所以防空設備一定要非常靈敏，不能輕易放過一天二十四小時中的每一分鐘。</p>

<h3>National Army in Siping Begins Offensive: Western Liaoning Recovers Heishan County; Sweeping Operations around Yingkou Capture Strongholds</h3>
<p>Map of the Western Liaoning Corridor</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The National Army in Siping has now begun its offensive. On the 10th, it launched an attack on the bandit army's Second Column and Independent Division entrenched in Changtu and areas north of Shubeng Niushao, inflicting heavy casualties. The bandits fled towards Bamiancheng and Changtu Railway Station. The bandit's Third and Fourth Columns, which had infiltrated Kaiyuan Railway Station, were also repelled by powerful National Army units, and there is no trace of bandits in the vicinity.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 12th] In the past two or three days, the communist bandits used a large part of their forces to capture strongholds in Western Qian, with Xinlitun as a major hub. After the communist bandits invaded this area, they stood at the center of this crossroads, plotting to expand in all directions. Currently, the most threatened area is the Dahushan to Xinmin section of the Beining Line. Xinlitun is connected to Xinmin in the east, and connects to Gaotaizi in the north, which is called the Gao-Xin Line. Gaotaizi is a station between Xinmin and Juliuhe on the Beining Line. Xinlitun is connected to Dachushan in the south. Heishan County, the first station 16 kilometers northwest of Dahushan, briefly fell into the hands of bandits on the night of the 10th, but was repelled by National Army reinforcements and recovered on the 12th. The Daba and Shala stations on the Xin (Litun)-Yi (County) Line fell into the hands of bandits, and the Fuxin Coal Mine was greatly threatened, with coal production now only able to go to Jinzhou via Yi County.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The National Army in Yingkou launched a sweeping operation, recovering strongholds such as Xiaochuanxin Street and Dashuitang outside Yingkou one by one. The remnants of the bandits have fled towards Dashiqiao.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changchun, 12th] The National Army in Changchun City launched continuous attacks in recent days, achieving considerable gains in Danantun yesterday and capturing two Korean bandits.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Liang Hua-sheng arrived in Changchun on the 11th. On the 12th, accompanied by Mayor Sun Guiji, he inspected refugee shelters, porridge kitchens, and other places in the urban area. It is said that there are no traces of bandits within fifty miles of Jilin City, public security is not a problem, and people are extremely calm.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 12th] It was reported here today that the National Army stated: The situation in Tieling is extremely severe, with large armies from both sides gathered. Communist bandits deployed infantry to meet the incoming forces, attempting to break through the National Army's defense line, but were repelled. The National Army also launched a counteroffensive with the assistance of multiple aircraft squadrons. The outcome of this battle may affect the entire war situation in the Northeast. It is reported that the communist bandits attacking the Western Liaoning Corridor have lost a quarter of their total force, while the National Army has suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Situation in Luoyang Stabilized; Eastern Section of Longhai Railway Clear; Garrison Established in Echeng to Prevent Bandit Infiltration</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kaifeng, 12th] Military news: The bandits who invaded the suburbs of Luoyang were bravely resisted by the National Army and were driven out this morning. Xigong has been recovered, and fierce fighting is still ongoing with the bandits on the outskirts of Xigong. Staff at Luoyang Railway Station were evacuated to Heishiguan yesterday. The bandits in Neihuang, Yu-Shu, after being suppressed, fled north of the railway yesterday. The National Army armored vehicles arrived in Neihuang this morning, and passenger trains on the Longhai Railway are running as usual. The section of the Huai River between Linhuai, Bengbu, and Huaiyuan has been opened, and navigation has been restored.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] A small group of bandit troops who had infiltrated the Zhougong Temple and Shangqing Palace near Luoyang has been annihilated by the National Army.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Bengbu, 12th] About ten thousand bandits who crossed the Jinpu Railway from Mengcheng County in northern Anhui, with their vanguard troops infiltrating Dadian in Lingbi County, attempting to attack the county seat. The National Army pursuit troops arrived on their heels. Both railway bridges at Xisipo on the Jinpu Railway have been repaired, and trains are running as usual on the 12th. The Huai River between Linhuai, Bengbu, and Huaiyuan is open and navigation has resumed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hefei, 12th] The bandit army in Maotanchang invaded Shucheng on the 11th and divided into groups to infiltrate Taoxi Town. Local militia are still counterattacking. Hefei remains calm as usual.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] Military news: To prevent communist bandits from infiltrating across the Yangtze River, the authorities have recently established a garrison command in Echeng (Wu-Xue) Yang (Luo), with Jiang Xianmo as the commander. Furthermore, the bandits entrenched in Cangzibu (southeast of Huangpi) have been pursued by our army and have fled to Zhangdian. Currently, only scattered bandits remain in that area.</p>
<h3>National Army in Jiaodong Clears the Battlefield</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 12th] On the 12th, the National Army in areas such as Fanjiaji and Taitou launched separate attacks and cleared the battlefield. The communist bandits continued to retreat in two directions, northeast and southwest, with those retreating south fleeing to areas south of the Jiaoji Railway.</p>
<h3>Yantai Telecommunications Restored; Shipping between Tianjin and Yantai Also Open</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] After the recovery of Yantai, Gao Bin, the director of the Yantai Telecommunications Bureau who received the Yantai telecommunications, has arrived in Yantai to carry out restoration work. Telecommunications have been restored, and the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau's business offices have begun accepting and sending telegrams to Yantai. Furthermore, after Chenghaiwei was recovered by the National Army, the Qingdao Telecommunications Bureau has also sent personnel to quickly handle the restoration work.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] Shipping between Tianjin and Yantai has been opened. The Ruixiang Wheel is scheduled to sail from Tianjin with passengers on the 16th. This is the first passenger ship to sail after the recovery of Yantai. The Yong'an Wheel will follow on the 18th.</p>

<h3>Calamity on the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Repeated Damage Difficult to Repair; No Hope of Traffic within Half a Year</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Liyang, 12th] Since the railway between Changchun and Shenyang was damaged by the communist bandits in late May, after two months of repairs, 147 kilometers of track, 38 bridges, 203 kilometers of telecommunications, and 14,000 square meters of station buildings have been repaired, requiring 370,000 sleepers. Now it has been repeatedly damaged by the communist bandits. According to an engineer, unless 800,000 sleepers can be purchased from Taiwan or overseas, there is no hope of traffic within half a year after the end of this bandit offensive.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Besiege Yuncheng in Southern Shanxi; National Army Recovers Xinkou in Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] It seems that the communist bandits intend to launch a large-scale siege of Yuncheng. The bandits transferred a brigade from northern Henan to Shanxi, and on the evening of the 8th, they engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops at Yuncheng Railway Station. The defending National Army fired with heavy artillery, and fierce fighting continued until the 11th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] The National Army in northern Shanxi's Xin County has been sweeping the area for days. Chezhen Qicun northwest of Xin County and Xinkou, a strategic point north of Xin County, were recovered on the 10th and 11th respectively.</p>
<h3>Zou Zuohua Arrives in Shenyang</h3>
<p>To Assume Important Responsibilities in the Recovered Area</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Military News Agency reports: Regarding an important task in the recovered area of the Northeast, the authorities have now decided to appoint Zou Zuohua, a veteran of the Northeast. Zou has now arrived in Shenyang from Nanjing and is actively starting his work. It is reported that this is one of the new measures taken after Chen Cheng concurrently took charge of the Northeast Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Mail and Telecommunications in Tianjin to Begin on the 15th</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] The military authorities in Tianjin have been ordered to inspect mail and telecommunications. The inspection office is scheduled to be established on the 14th and start work on the 15th.</p>
<h3>War Breaks Out Again in the Ping-Bao Section; Offensive and Defensive War Unfolds at Xushui City Walls</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Baoding, 12th] War has broken out again in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The main force of the Second and Third Columns of the bandit Nie Rongzhen's troops, more than 20,000 men, launched a full-scale attack on the National Army strongholds in Beihedian and Baoding Wen from 7:00 PM yesterday. Artillery fire could be heard throughout Baoding all night. The National Army bunkers along the railway were shelled by the bandit artillery. The defending troops fought hard and are still resisting to this day. Some bunkers have been abandoned. As of 4:00 PM on the 12th, fierce fighting was still ongoing between Beihe, Guchengzhen, Xushui, and Caohe. The 110-li stretch between Baoding and Beihe has fallen into a state of chaotic warfare.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Fierce fighting is taking place in the suburbs of Xushui. Two brigades of bandits attacked the city gate and the railway station area. As of this noon, the situation at the railway station is unclear. The battle for strongholds within ten li of the four suburbs is in full swing, and the offensive and defensive war at the city walls has also begun fiercely. The defending troops in Xushui have repeatedly telegraphed the military here today for emergency assistance. In the afternoon, the center of the battle has concentrated near the Xuhe Bridge, 15 li northeast of Baoding City. The Baoding armored vehicle unit has gone north to assist in the battle, with intense artillery fire. Furthermore, the sound of bandit landmine explosions between Beihedian and Caohe has been incessant all night, and the damage to the tracks and bridges is severe. All northbound trains from Baoding have not departed today. Officials say: Xushui has strong fortifications and abundant troops, and the city defense is impregnable. Currently, the National Army corps heading south along the Ping-Bao Road has been instructed to reinforce Beihedian.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] There is more trouble in the Ping-Bao section. This morning, the section between Songlindian and Gaobeidian in Zhuoxian County was damaged again. Details south of Gaobeidian are unknown due to damage to telecommunications. Southbound trains are now passing through Zhuoxian. Another report: Several thousand communist bandits entering Hebei from Shandong are also moving towards the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<h3>India's Surplus Cotton: Negotiations Underway to Sell to China on Credit</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Sources from relevant departments: India has a large surplus of cotton this year, estimated at about 1.8 million bales. It is reported that the relevant Indian authorities will adopt a loan method to sell it to China, and both sides are currently in negotiations.</p>
<h3>De Wang Re-emerging: No Such Possibility at Present</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Regarding the report by United Press a few days ago that De Wang might re-emerge, reporters inquired from all sides and all said that there was no such thing, and there is no such tendency or possibility at present. This is likely the speculation of sensitive reporters after Chairman Chiang summoned and met with Wang in Beiping. When Chairman Chiang met with De Wang in Beiping a few days ago, he expressed his support for the implementation of local autonomy. De Wang briefly stated his opinion that "the Inner Mongolia issue is not a local issue, but an ethnic issue." Apart from this, the conversation did not involve any specific issues. When De Wang met with reporters today, he spoke freely for an hour, advocating convening a second Mongolian conference to solve the Inner Mongolia issue. (Continued on page 2, column 3)</p>

The old man's name is Lin Wuwu. It is said that all of his forest property was robbed by the deputy head of the township and others, and he had no way to appeal, so he specially blocked the car to make his case. Song's entourage almost mistook him for an assassin, causing a false alarm. Upon learning that he was calling for justice, Song handed him over to Police Chief Li Jinhan for questioning.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting on the 13th to discuss technical issues related to the election. At the same time, the issue of party members participating in the election will also be discussed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to a senior member of the Democratic Socialist Party, the negotiations on the general election among the three parties are still underway in Nanjing. Apart from the number of representatives, all other issues have been agreed upon, and it is expected that the negotiations can be successfully concluded this month. In terms of the number of representatives, both parties advocate a distribution ratio of 3:1:1:1, but the Kuomintang's proposal is far lower than this number, so everything still needs to be further negotiated. In addition, the party held a central standing committee meeting in the afternoon of the 12th to discuss the technical issues of the general election.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the issue of labor groups participating in the election, the Ministry of Social Affairs recently replied to the election headquarters that postal unions organized according to administrative regions, joining county and city general labor unions, should participate in the elections of those county and city labor unions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Will Meet with MacArthur to Discuss the Peace Treaty with Japan and the Occupation Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A Chinese delegation official here stated that Foreign Minister Wang will return home at the end of the month after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He will stop here for a few days to discuss the peace treaty with Japan and the occupation issue with MacArthur and other officials of the Supreme Command.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th] China and the United States are consulting here and in Washington on eliminating the points of disagreement between the two countries on how to handle the Japanese peace treaty. The biggest problem between China and the United States is the number of merchant ships that Japan can have. China hopes to limit it to a much smaller number than the United States advocates. It is generally believed that China will make good use of its position and delay the treaty as much as possible. If the United States is willing to make some concessions, China will agree to give up its veto power and have eleven countries draft the treaty. The Chinese representative was quite pleased when the Soviet Union severely criticized the United States' policy toward Japan, which was building up Japan to re-invade. Although China does not agree with the United States' support for Japan as a springboard for imperialist conspiracies, China deeply feels that the Soviet Union's opposition to Japan's military build-up is well-intentioned.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 12th] Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Bullitt proposed in Life Magazine that the United States should help China with 1.35 billion US dollars to prevent the Soviet Union from conquering China. This plan has hardly caused any waves in North China. Political circles believe that this plan is too theoretical and has little chance of being realized, and even if it is passed, its conditions will be very harsh.</p>
<h3>We Should Take a Calm Attitude Towards American Statements on Aiding China; Xi Yushu Comments on Bullitt's Proposal</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Xi Yushu recently commented on Bullitt's emergency aid proposal, saying in essence: Bullitt's intention is very good, but it is too idealized, because Bullitt's publication of this article is completely from the standpoint of the masses, and his identity is the representative of Luce's Life Magazine. In actual politics, I am afraid that it may not have much impact. The whole question is that the United States' attitude towards China is not clear. People in the country should take a calm attitude towards the words of such friendly countries, and do not need to be sad or happy about it. If we think about it with common sense, in the entire Second World War, China's contribution was very great, and it was almost on the verge of danger, but the United States still adopted the Europe First policy, and the lease assistance to China was very small. At this time, China is mired in difficulties again, and the United States should provide a large amount of assistance without haggling. In fact, today's problems in China cannot be solved by hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Political Committee Member Jiang Yuntian recently commented on Bullitt's emergency aid proposal, saying: This proposal is very timely, but MacArthur may not be willing to come to China to take office. What our country needs now is large-scale unconditional assistance, including military supplies, materials, financial assistance, and the dispatch of engineers and technicians. As for whether MacArthur comes to China or not, it doesn't matter much. The most important thing is that the United States' policy towards China can no longer be a business calculation, otherwise China will suffer deeply and the United States will regret it one day.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on Reading Mr. Phelphs' "Impressions of a Visit to China" - A Re-examination of Sino-American Relations -</h3>
<p>Mr. Phelphs, the former U.S. Ambassador to France and the Soviet Union, published a lengthy report entitled "Impressions of a Visit to China" in "Life" magazine, advocating for emergency U.S. aid to China and suggesting the selection of General MacArthur to oversee the $1.35 billion aid plan. This article has attracted considerable attention from both Chinese and American figures. During Mr. Phelphs' stay in China, we had the opportunity to converse and frankly exchange opinions. He also traveled extensively throughout China, engaging with various people. Therefore, I firmly believe that Mr. Phelphs' observations are based on reliable and practical materials.</p>
<p>Mr. Phelphs' intention is to use American aid to prevent China from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. However, the "Ta Mei Evening News" editorial even stated that some Americans would rather keep the $1.35 billion than let the Soviet Union control China. Regardless of who is right or wrong in their opinions, we must first clarify that China is, and always will be, China, standing firm and unshaken. Whether the United States provides aid or not, China will always fight to the end for the integrity of its national territorial sovereignty, and will never willingly fall into the hands of the Soviet Union, nor will it necessarily be content to be an appendage of the United States. However, we must remind some American friends that it was the American authorities who betrayed China and signed the Yalta Agreement. China has not done anything to wrong the United States.</p>
<p>We would like to take the opportunity of the publication of Mr. Phelphs' "Impressions of a Visit to China" to present our views on Sino-American relations for discussion by those concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>The problems between China and the United States can be summarized into the following points:</p>
<p>First, is the American understanding of China. China is obviously behind the United States in every aspect, far from the current standards of the United States. This is a fact; it cannot be denied or evaded. However, one point we must all pay attention to is that China, in some important aspects, is no different from the United States. Whatever is not applicable in the United States, such as communism, will certainly not be applicable in China. Whatever Americans value, such as "purge movements" within the government and the preservation of national and ethnic interests, China values equally. Moreover, because China's national strength is not as strong as that of the United States, and the foundation of its government is not as stable, it can even be said that the Chinese people's emphasis on the above two points must exceed that of the Americans. "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." The United States itself rejects communism, but as Mr. Phelphs pointed out, it believes that "the Chinese Communist Party is only a land reformist," so it may as well promote communism in China; the U.S. government itself adopts a "purge policy," but believes that China, to "progress," must adopt a "united government" that accommodates the Communists. This is somewhat inconsiderate on the part of the United States.</p>
<p>Second, is the issue of American understanding of the Chinese government. Anyone who pays a little attention to American public opinion knows that American public opinion's criticism of our government is extremely harsh. Although Mr. Phelphs believes that "Chairman Chiang's vision and wisdom are unmatched by any politician in history," Americans always believe that the Chinese government is too inefficient and incompetent, especially after General Wedemeyer's scathing criticism of "corruption and incompetence." But we would like to remind our American friends: please put themselves in the position of the Chinese government and think about it. In today's situation, with diplomatic and domestic affairs constrained everywhere, and no policy able to be implemented freely, after eight years of war against Japan, and now facing an unprecedented communist insurgency, I am afraid that no government would have a panacea that can cure everything with a single dose. Recently, the labor unrest in Shanghai was quickly quelled due to the joint efforts of various party, government, and military agencies, and the communist conspiracy was unable to succeed. Westerners in Shanghai believe that the government's ability far exceeds that of European and American countries. This is indeed a fair assessment. Today, China is riddled with holes, and there is almost a sense of helplessness. The government wants to engage in salvaging efforts, but often feels that if it supports the east, the west will collapse again. Mr. Phelphs sees this very clearly. This is because he is a writer for "Life" and "Fortune" magazines, and he has the freedom to easily approach the broad and simple Chinese people.</p>
<p>Third, is American aid to China. When it comes to this issue, we should pay attention to the following two points: First, is the view on aid. Second, is the effectiveness of this aid. First, let's talk about the view. We must know that if any two countries talk about aid, it must involve mutual benefit. One-sided beneficial aid is only relief in nature, and it cannot be sustained. American aid to China, simply put, should be a matter of mutual benefit. Unfortunately, some Americans see this as a one-sided benefit for China. In other words, they mistakenly believe that this is just charitable relief, which has affected the firm implementation of American policy and presented a phenomenon of wavering and fluctuation. Second, is the effect of relief. American rhetoric has recently tended to believe that China is a "bottomless pit" and that the effect of American aid is minimal. The source of this view is partly due to American people's lack of understanding of the intrinsic meaning of the Chinese problem, and partly due to a small number of American businessmen in China who may still be unable to forget the old days, and thus criticize Chinese affairs from a die-hard and narrow perspective, which has also affected the policies of the American government to some extent. To answer this question, we only need to compare the small amount of American aid to China during the war of resistance against Japan with the greatness of China's achievements to get the answer. Honestly speaking, there is no other country in the world that uses foreign materials as carefully as China. We have never used any American aid to us for any sinister and harmful plans against the United States. Please let Americans compare how the Soviet Union used American aid.</p>
<p>Fourth, having clarified the above three points, we can then review American policy. American policy is indeed contradictory. Leaving aside the above-mentioned different treatment of the Communist Party in China and in the United States, let's focus on the general American policy towards China. It can be said that it is sometimes active, sometimes passive, sometimes praising China to the heavens, and sometimes suppressing China to the ground. For example, Marshal Marshall's visit to China, how enthusiastic was the American policy towards China before his arrival, and how cold and indifferent did it become after Marshall left. We sympathize deeply with the difficulties Marshall encountered in his mission in China, and the fact that the Chinese Communists ultimately failed to embark on the path of peaceful cooperation with the government must be an indelible regret in Marshall's heart. However, do American people know what kind of painful experience China has suffered under this wavering policy of the United States? The Chinese people deeply know that the intention of friendly countries is pure, and deeply feel that it is also truly admirable, so they do not hesitate to compromise in order to seek perfection, knowing that it is impossible, but still doing it. However, the policy adopted by the United States towards China in the past stage was a dead end, a blind alley, and its inevitable change of course was destined. Today, as the United States looks back on the past, it should replace hesitation with firmness, and passivity with activity, in order to help itself and its friends. Mr. Phelphs probably sees this more clearly.</p>
<p>Fifth, there is one more point we would like to make to supplement Mr. Phelphs' paper, which is that to understand China, one must look at it from a historical perspective. From a historical perspective, there are two points that should be noted: One is why is China so poor today? The other is how did China extricate itself when it encountered difficulties in history? First, let's talk about the first point. Everything in China today is the accumulation of history. Two hundred and eighty years of alien rule, a hundred years of the constraints of unequal treaties, twenty years of warlords playing with soldiers, twenty years of communist national disaster, and eight years of bloody war against Japan have exhausted China's national strength and people's strength to this point. Today's government is a struggler under this historical accumulation. Its efforts may not be exhaustive, but to put this heavy burden on its shoulders and say that this is all the fault of the current government is illogical and unfair. Second, China has encountered crises in its five thousand years of history that are ten or a hundred times greater than today, and they are too numerous to count. The Chinese people have always broken through and revived by their own strength. The Chinese people have never had the mentality of relying solely on foreign aid. That is why it has continued for five thousand years and still stands tall in the world. Today, although China welcomes foreign aid, it has no intention of begging for mercy! The Chinese people especially do not want to use "extortion" to obtain human aid. The Chinese are loyal friends, but they are friends.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, today's increase in Sino-American friendship and the clarification of the dark and turbid air between the two countries is extremely important, and the way to achieve it is very easy. As long as we measure from mutual understanding to mutual trust, and from mutual trust to mutual respect, the bright and open path will surely be in front of the people of both countries!</p>

<h3>Zhu Jia Yi Talks About the Communist International</h3>
<p>"The emergence of a new organization of the Communist International is less a resurrection of the Third International and more a consistent trick of the Third International to exploit international contradictions, because the Communist Party's strategy has always been untrustworthy and not bound by treaty obligations. It takes advantage of changes in the international situation at any time to seek advancement. As for its organizational form, whether it is hidden or visible, it does not hinder the expansion of its international policies. Therefore, the announcement in Moscow in 1943 to abolish the Third International organization was a complete farce, only a strategy to exchange for Allied assistance. In fact, in the past four years, the Communist Party's actions in our country, as in other parts of the world, especially in Eastern European countries, have all been based on its international policies. According to the principles of the United Nations Charter, all countries should respect each other's national interests and have the freedom to choose their own political system. Now, with the accumulation of actions of the Communist International, this principle has already been directly undermined, and human justice and morality have also been greatly threatened and are trending towards collapse. Because of its universal implementation of international policies, all non-communist countries and people are facing a critical moment of life and death. All democratic countries should be wary. Therefore, we should not regard the resurgence of the Communist International as merely a diplomatic action against the European Recovery Program and the United States. All countries that uphold the United Nations should cooperate closely, seek political and economic stability together, eradicate the source of chaos, strengthen the organization of the United Nations, and establish peace for the sake of their own independent survival, because only collective action can achieve collective security and enable all nations in the world to coexist independently and eliminate the threat of the Red International.</p>
<h3>Please Uphold the Cooperation Movement</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Credit cooperatives are cooperatives that engage in lending and deposit-taking. They are established in accordance with the provisions of the Cooperative Law, which is what Dr. Sun Yat-sen referred to as "banking cooperation" in his teachings. The Ministry of Finance believes that those who are not in the banking business do not even know what the word "credit" means, so what is the "credit cooperative" business? Since credit cooperatives are mainly engaged in lending and deposit-taking, allowing them to withdraw funds by check is a natural result of business in order to facilitate borrowing and deposit-taking by members. The government should encourage and promote this. Credit cooperatives are civilian financial institutions. A study of credit cooperatives in various countries shows that not only are they not prohibited from using checks, but they are also promoted and encouraged by their respective governments. Credit cooperatives are civilian financial institutions recognized by economists around the world. Dr. Sun Yat-sen called them "cooperative banks" and advocated their widespread establishment. Moreover, the basic national policy chapter of the Constitution clearly stipulates that "cooperative enterprises shall be encouraged and assisted by the state," and the Ministry of Finance should not discriminate against them. The date the Ministry of Finance issued the order was September 27, which was two days before the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, which was the time when all industries and residents settled their accounts. Financial institutions are the hub for all industries to settle their accounts. It is suspected that they deliberately tried to destroy civilian financial institutions. We request the National Government to revoke the order issued by the Ministry of Finance on September 27 prohibiting the acceptance of checks with credit cooperatives as payers, and to recognize checks with credit cooperatives as payers as legal instruments.</p>
<h3>Wu Chunlin Makes a Speech in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) The purpose of this trip is that the Taiwanese people have been separated from the mainland for too long, and I hope to use this trip to understand the actual situation and examine the actual implementation of policies as a reference for local autonomy in Taiwan. During this trip to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, every plant and tree felt worthy of cherishing, especially the atmosphere of revitalization in Nanjing, which is gratifying to the Taiwanese people. The "February 28 Incident" has become a thing of the past, but the facts are definitely not as serious as rumored. If there are any statements against the Taiwanese people, they are deliberately destructive. If Taiwan had not been ceded to Japan that year, the Taiwanese people could have worked hard and sacrificed for the war against Japan just like their compatriots in the mainland during the war of resistance. In terms of education, all schools use textbooks in Mandarin Chinese and teach in Mandarin Chinese. Two-thirds of the factories are now operating, compared to the total number of factories taken over. Wu et al. also put forward several hopes: The handling of the "February 28 Incident" has not yet ended. As of now, four city councilors are still in prison and four are missing. The central government issued eight handling guidelines at the beginning of the incident, but they have not yet been completed, and we are very concerned about this. Politically, to date, the public opinion organs in Taiwan Province cannot fully express public opinion, and private newspapers have not yet been restored, which is a shortcoming of democratic politics. Economically, I hope that the domestic economic community can assist in the construction of Taiwan Province so that it can recover quickly. Wu et al. finally stated: I deeply hope that people from the mainland can visit Taiwan, especially those in the press are more welcome.</p>
<h3>De Wang Speaks in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) De Wang believes that the most terrible phenomenon in China today is not political corruption or economic disorder, but the failure of education. He strongly advocates the development of healthy rural education to strengthen the foundation of the country. He also said that the extreme development of world science and the current international political situation may lead mankind to destruction. If it is fortunate enough not to be completely destroyed, then Chinese Confucian philosophy and Indian philosophy may still be valued by people all over the world and used as a tool to save mankind from crisis. De Wang flew south alone after Japan surrendered. His wife and four sons were taken to Kulun by the Outer Mongolian army. His only property in Beiping, No. 6, Lane 47, Dongsi, was sold for 40 million yuan this March. He now lives in the home of Mr. Han, a fellow Mongolian villager, and leads a Puritan-style life.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Indonesia Send a Telegram to the Chairman, Requesting Protection</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, November 11] The United Office of the Indonesian Chinese General Association today sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting the chairman to personally come forward to protect the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra. The original text of the telegram is as follows: Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Indonesia are constantly in extreme danger, and many overseas Chinese are killed every day. After the Republican army was defeated by the Dutch army, it retaliated with innocent neutral overseas Chinese. They kill overseas Chinese as if they were killing beasts. The glory and prestige of China have been destroyed by leaders who claim to be fighting for national freedom. We sincerely hope that the chairman can seek international guarantees to prevent the Indonesian Republican army in Java and Sumatra from repeatedly killing overseas Chinese by mistake. At the same time, when necessary, provide international military occupation to areas where continued accidental killings and abductions occur until the government can prove that it can maintain law and order and guarantee the safety of life and property. We sincerely ask the chairman to personally come forward to protect us. The office also took the opportunity of the Double Tenth National Day to pay tribute to Chairman Chiang on behalf of more than one million overseas Chinese in Indonesia and congratulate him on the National Day.</p>

<h3>Military Traitors in Beiping Secretly Gamble in Prison, Using Steamed Buns to Make Dominoes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, November 12] Northern military traitors detained in the Beiping Army Prison are unwilling to be lonely and have come up with ingenious ideas. They use the cornmeal steamed buns of the prisoners' rations to make dominoes, mahjong tiles, dice, etc. They secretly gamble every day. The Japanese military found out about this yesterday. It is certified that most of them are heads of puppet troops. Their families send food every day, and they have enough money to use. Among them, Huang Nanjuan, the puppet police commander, is moody and often beats his fellow prisoners.</p>
<h3>Prostitutes in Beiping Disrupt School, Female Brothel Inmates Collectively Enter the Police Station</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, November 12] Disputes occurred between prostitutes in Beiping who were attending classes and receiving training in the past two days. The prostitutes protested against the words of the instructors and even engaged in mutual beatings. Both sides were injured. The authorities decided to change the training method. The first and second-class prostitutes have completed their training, and the training of the third-class will begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, November 12] The first week of classes and training for the daughters of Beiping Kang has come to an end. The police officers and their peach and plum students opened a full-fledged fight as a farewell gift. It turned out that when the hygiene instructor was lecturing, he drew pictures on the blackboard to increase the sound and color. The selling smiles mistakenly understood the meaning of the pictures, and were ashamed to look at them, and asked to erase them. In the end, they all rioted and attacked him. The instructor could not explain himself, and hurriedly fled the classroom. These instructors, in order to maintain the dignity of the teacher, came in droves to quell the public anger. As soon as they entered the classroom, they saw a flock of phoenixes and swallows, with green smoke curling up. They were smoking cigarettes. The solemn school rules were once again violated. The teachers and students first blamed each other with colloquial language, followed by "three iron roosters," and finally the unteachable prostitutes were collectively led into the police station, where a senior diplomat personally solved the matter.</p>

<h3>Three Newspaper Offices in Kaifeng Destroyed by Female Students, Authorities Have Promised Compensation and Punishment of the Perpetrators</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Kaifeng, November 12] In the government's three orders and five assurances of guaranteeing freedom of the press, the offices of the Dahe Daily, Zhongzhou Evening News, and Northwest News Agency in this city were tragically destroyed by students from Kaifeng Girls' High School at around 8 o'clock the night before last, with losses of more than 500 million. It turned out that the Zhongzhou Evening News had published a news item the day before yesterday about the principal of the school, Ma Ziqi, embezzling, and at the same time, it also carried a news item about a female student from a certain girls' school giving birth. That night, the principal, out of shame and anger, incited students to go to the newspaper office to destroy it on the grounds that the newspaper insulted the female students. At that time, teachers and staff of the school led more than 600 students into the newspaper office. The Dahe Daily and the Northwest News Agency, because they were in the same courtyard as the newspaper office, were all destroyed. All machine rooms, typesetting rooms, editorial departments, president's office, and other departments were completely smashed. The damage was severe and could not be restored in the short term. All sectors of the city were extremely angry about this riot at the school and demanded that the authorities severely investigate the person in charge of the school and compensate for the losses. The Journalists Association immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss steps to deal with the matter. After negotiations with the authorities, the authorities accepted the conditions of compensating for the losses, investigating Principal Ma and the perpetrators, and having the school formally apologize to the newspaper office. A storm was quelled.</p>

<h3>Puley's Impressions of His Visit to China. See Yesterday's Fifth Edition</h3>
<p>General Marshall arrived in China's wartime capital, Chongqing, on December 22, 1945. He was highly respected and managed to get the Chinese government and the Communist Party to sign an agreement on January 10, 1946, to cease conflict and restore transportation. Secondly, before he returned to Washington on March 13, 1946, he seemed to have opened up possible avenues for achieving a ceasefire in the Northeast. On the surface, it appeared that Marshall had achieved considerable success in mediating a cessation of conflict within China in less than three months.</p>
<p>This surface appearance was deceptive. The Soviet government's objectives were different from General Marshall's. On the day of Japan's surrender, there were no Communist troops in the Northeast. The Soviet plan was to take advantage of the ceasefire mediated by Marshall</p>
<p>to transport as many Communist troops as possible from North China to the Northeast, and to equip the Communist troops with a large number of weapons received from the Japanese army in the Northeast. Taking advantage of the ceasefire period, the Soviet army would then withdraw after the Communist troops were fully equipped. This plan was fully realized.</p>
<p>Three days after General Marshall left China and returned to the United States, the Soviet army withdrew from Siping, and the Communist army immediately attacked. Sipingjie is a strategic city between Shenyang and Changchun, and is the intersection of railways in all directions. After the Soviet army withdrew from Changchun on April 14, the Communist army immediately attacked the city. General Marshall went to China again on April 17, and Changchun was captured by the Communist Party the next day.</p>
<p>General Marshall continued his mission with his usual determination and dignity. In reality, he never had a chance of success from the beginning. The Communist Party was loyal to Moscow, and the Nationalist Party was loyal to its country. It was impossible for the two to truly cooperate, just as water and oil cannot mix. This is true in China, and it is true in any country in the world. Therefore, the final conclusion of Marshall's work in China is: never has such a distinguished military man been sent to carry out such a hopeless and unwise political mission.</p>
<p>After the failure of the Marshall mission, the United States' China policy fell into a state of weary indifference, adopting a nonchalant tendency to "let China sort itself out." This was a particularly dangerous policy because it sought to force the Chinese government to accept our one-sided and erroneous idea that the Soviet Union was a "peace-loving democracy" and that the Chinese Communist Party was merely a land reformer, which was necessary to join the Chinese government (a view that the current U.S. government has completely abandoned), and therefore, aid to the Chinese government was cut off. The 500 million dollar loan that had been allocated to China was</p>
<p>held back. The "Eighth and One-Third Air Force Plan," which was approved by the U.S. government and initiated by Chennault in July 1946, was unilaterally terminated by us in September 1946. According to that plan, the United States agreed to equip China with an eighth and one-third air force team and provide maintenance parts. Secondly, the contract signed in the spring of 1946 for the supply of parts for the old vehicles we left in China was also not fulfilled.</p>
<p>And the most serious thing was that we equipped some divisions and some parts of the troops in China with American guns, American machine guns, and rifles, and promised to continue to supply ammunition, but then we withheld the export licenses for ammunition. As a result, this American-equipped army ran out of ammunition and faced the newly equipped Communist army, which was heavily armed by the Soviet Union with Japanese weapons. The U.S. government intended to force the Chinese government to adopt a policy that we now know to be wrong, which was tantamount to disarming our friends, while the Soviet Union, on the other hand, equipped our enemies. It was not until this spring that the situation became clear. Unless we can recognize the importance of national interests and take corresponding actions, it will not be "letting China sort itself out," but the Soviet Union will sort it out. Therefore, General Wei was sent to China to investigate the situation. What exactly is the situation?</p>
<p>Today, the Chinese government firmly controls China, reaching the north. Small groups of bandits, some claiming to be Communists, are entrenched in remote areas south of the Yangtze River, but the people of Shanghai call the area south of the Yangtze River the "peaceful construction area," which is correct. From North China to the Soviet border is a war zone.</p>
<p>However, the situation of the war is completely different from the combat experience of the American army in the European theater in the two world wars. The Communist army uses guerrilla tactics, acting quickly, attacking at night, and hiding and resting during the day. If an observer were to sit in an airplane and fly low for hundreds of miles in the area where the Communist guerrillas are scattered in North China or the Northeast, he would not see a single soldier or any signs of troop movement. When it gets dark, the Communist army concentrates and quickly advances towards the target of attack, often traveling twenty miles a night, implementing a night raid. The Communist Party's desire to</p>
<p>overthrow the government does not lie in defeating the National Army, but in destroying the country's economic life. Therefore, they do not hesitate to burn towns, destroy railways, telegraphs, telephone lines, destroy factory machinery, and blow up industrial equipment such as power plants, anything they cannot take away.</p>
<p>The National Army intends to protect the towns, so most of them are constrained in fixed places. They move slower than the Communist army, and often when they attack, they find that the Communist army has already fled secretly at night. In theory, the Communist army must protect the Red Capital Yan'an for the sake of face, and when the National Army launches a fierce attack on the city, it must annihilate its largest main force. But in fact, the government captured the city, but did not annihilate its army. They had already fled to Shanxi Province, a neighboring province. Currently, the National Army is clearing the Communist army in Shandong, but a large number of Communist troops have already fled to Henan, leaving only a desolate land. This is the situation of the war in North China.</p>
<p>The situation in the Northeast is different. Except for Dalian and Lushun, which are occupied by the Soviet army, the National Army controls most of the southern part of the Northeast. The Communist army occupies the rest of the Northeast, except for a narrow strip of land in the middle from Shenyang to Jilin, which runs along the railway, which passes through Sipingjie and Changchun. This railway is no longer a railway. All the bridges north of thirty miles south of Sipingjie have been destroyed by the Communist army, most of the sleepers have been burned, and many rails have also been distorted by burning.</p>
<p>Therefore, the city of Changchun, which is now in the hands of the government, has been completely cut off from railway transportation. Changchun, which was once the capital of Manchukuo, has wide streets, magnificent buildings, and nearly one million residents, and is similar to Washington, D.C. in many aspects. The Changchun area has fertile soil and beautiful scenery, similar to the Skagit River Valley in Washington State. The countryside around Changchun is very prosperous, so the city still has sufficient food, and most of the grain is transported by ox carts. But Changchun has no heating. And the winter in the Northeast is as cold as the Arctic, so every tree that can be chopped down, even doors, windows, floors, and beams, are used as firewood for heating.</p>
<p>Changchun is currently defended by the New First Army. This army can be said to be the elite of the National Army. They were trained and equipped by General Stilwell in Burma. General Stilwell believed that Chinese soldiers, as long as they are well trained, clothed, fed, equipped, and commanded, are equal to the soldiers of any strong country in the world. The demeanor of the New First Army is still</p>
<p>very dignified, which proves that General Stilwell's belief is correct. The soldiers of the New First Army enthusiastically remember the Americans, and when any American passes by on the street, they smile and greet them loudly. But behind their brave demeanor, the strength they had when they were under the command of the U.S. Army has disappeared. They only have American equipment. They have been using those weapons since they fought alongside our army in Burma, but now they are old. Forty percent of the rifles are inaccurate because they have been used for too long. Their American machine guns need new barrels. Although they have excellent American artillery, they cannot even practice firing because they lack ammunition. Most of their trucks are old and broken, and because our country has not complied with the contract and has not delivered the parts to them, they cannot repair them. They do not even have airplanes, so they cannot even scout. This is entirely because we have not fulfilled our promise to implement the "Eighth and One-Third Air Force Plan." We first encouraged the Chinese government to adopt American equipment, and then refused to issue export permits for ammunition, thus pushing the Chinese soldiers to the brink of despair. A large number of Communist troops in the east and west are expected to launch another offensive in September. (Continued on the fourth page)</p>

<h3>New U.S. Proposal on the Korean Question China and the U.K. Express Approval in Principle I Advocate for a Short-Term U.N. Trusteeship</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th] Authoritative sources revealed on the 12th that China and the U.K. have, "in principle," endorsed the U.S. proposal on Korea, which is to be submitted to the U.N. within days. The U.S. proposal requests that the U.N. monitor general elections in Korea and the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. China has also advised the U.S. delegation that China is determined to request that the General Assembly recommend a U.N. trusteeship for Korea for a certain period. The U.S., however, does not intend to include this point in its proposal. The U.S. position includes the following: If the U.N. passes the U.S. proposal and establishes an agency, the U.N. should be responsible for deciding how to administer South Korea during the transition period. The U.S. has informed China that if China wishes to recommend a trusteeship, China should raise this issue directly when the U.N. deals with this matter. At the same time, it is understood that the Soviet delegation will oppose the U.S. proposal, believing that it undermines the Moscow Agreement. However, the combined opinion of the majority of national delegations is that the Soviet Union's position has been weakened since its suggestion last month for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to withdraw together and leave the Korean people to solve their own problems. Liu Yuwan, Chinese Consul-General in Seoul, flew from Korea to New York, indicating that China is extremely interested in this matter. He is currently reporting the latest situation in Korea to Dr. Gu Weijun and other representatives.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Moscow Radio broadcasted last night that Molotov had written to Secretary Marshall, stating, "The attitude of the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission in Seoul clearly shows that the U.S. delegation has no intention of continuing the work of the Joint Commission to reach an agreement to resolve the issue of establishing a provisional democratic government in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Agreement. The U.S. delegation violated the Moscow Agreement and the agreement reached between the U.S. and Soviet governments in May 1947, insisting that not only should democratic parties and organizations in North and South Korea that declare their support for the Moscow Agreement and faithfully fulfill its conditions be allowed to participate in the provisional government, but even reactionary groups that have not signed the declaration and continue to be part of the 'Anti-Trusteeship Committee' should also be included. The Soviet delegation is determined to uphold the Moscow Agreement and cannot agree to this. The attitude of the U.S. delegation has made it impossible to establish a provisional democratic government in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Agreement and is hindering the establishment of a unified and democratic government in Korea. Therefore, the Soviet Union has instructed its delegation in Seoul to submit a new proposal to give the Korean people a chance to establish their own government without U.S. and Soviet participation, and U.S. and Soviet troops should also withdraw from Korea." However, the U.S. has not yet responded.</p>
<h3>U.N. Political Committee Passes Amendment on the Greek Question Gu Weijun Refutes Soviet Statements Involving China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] After the U.S. submitted an amendment on the Greek question, arguing that the U.N. "record" the assistance of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania to Greek guerrillas and urge the three countries to stop this aid, the U.N. General Assembly finally passed the amendment on the 11th with 36 votes in favor, 6 votes against, and 10 abstentions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] The U.S. previously demanded that the U.N. condemn Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for creating unrest in the Balkans. On the 11th, the U.S. suddenly retreated, but still insisted that the General Assembly should order the three countries to no longer support the Greek guerrillas in the future. Due to the increasing opposition, U.S. representative Johnson finally agreed to the Anglo-French amendment, which urged the General Assembly to pay attention to the majority judgment of the Balkan Investigation Team that Greek guerrillas had been aided by neighboring border countries.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Vyshinsky immediately stood up to oppose the Anglo-French supplementary proposal, calling it a "pair of jackals" with the original U.S. proposal. Vyshinsky forcefully stated, "The current situation in Greece is due to the domestic situation and foreign interference. Greece is like this, China is like this, and Indonesia is also like this. Wherever foreign interference goes, they all follow in the footsteps of Greece."</p>
<p>Chinese representative Gu Weijun retorted, saying, "I have no intention of conflicting with Vyshinsky, but I cannot remain silent and allow this erroneous view to exist. China, like other countries, has many difficulties due to long-term struggles. However, as for whether China has been subjected to foreign interference, you should agree that China knows this best. If China has been subjected to interference, it will be the first to raise and oppose it. Surface phenomena are often not the truth, and things that happen in secret are the most serious. If there is any possibility of interference, the Chinese government will immediately challenge it and bring it to the United Nations." Regarding the Anglo-French amendment, Gu believed that it was not necessary to directly or indirectly point out the faults of the three countries. "If it is not mentioned, it will make it easier for other parts of the proposal to pass, then this is necessary." The Chinese delegation has no opinion on the facts of this case, and the Chinese representative on the investigation team will vote in favor of the majority report, "But if omitting a section can increase broader cooperation, then it is worth considering. Assigning responsibility is secondary. What we should do is to strengthen cooperation and promote peace and tranquility in the Balkans."</p>
<h3>Spaak Returns Home Admits U.N. Has No Achievements</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] Spaak, head of the delegation attending the U.N. General Assembly and Prime Minister of Belgium, departed for home today, stating beforehand that the General Assembly had no achievements.</p>
<h3>Colonial Countries Should Submit Information Trusteeship Council Passes Indian-Soviet Proposal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 12th] The U.N. Trusteeship Council yesterday passed the resolution on colonial information proposed by India with 23 votes to 19. The resolution stipulated that the General Assembly should establish a special committee to meet three weeks before each General Assembly meeting to review reports submitted by colonial powers regarding their administered non-self-governing territories. The Soviet Union strongly supported this resolution, but colonial powers such as the U.K., France, Belgium, and the Netherlands firmly opposed it, believing that it exceeded the scope of the Charter. Another resolution proposed by the Soviet Union, which requested that powers administering non-self-governing territories provide information on the participation of indigenous people in local institutions, was also passed with 24 votes to 19.</p>
<h3>Greek Suppression of Guerrillas Battle Gains Ground</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 11th] The Greek government gazette stated that the war against guerrillas in the mountains northwest of Lamia has completely ended, with a total of 500 guerrillas killed, wounded, and captured. Guerrilla leader Markos said in a radio broadcast that government forces used tanks when fighting the guerrillas on the Kastanea border on September 20.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Fail to Reach Agreement on Austrian Treaty Treaty Committee Declares End of Work</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 11th] The four-power representatives of the Four-Power Austrian Treaty Committee jointly signed the final report that the committee should submit to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the morning of the 11th. Although the work of the Four-Power Committee has come to an end, its mission has not been completed. According to a statement issued by the British representative, the committee was unable to reach an agreement on all points regarding the Austrian treaty, and there was little progress even in narrowing the differences of opinion. The main stumbling block remains the issue of German assets. At the beginning of the meeting, it was originally expected that a committee of experts would study the specific facts related to German assets to undertake the important work of the Four-Power Committee, but because the Soviet Union did not see the expert committee as having independence in its work from the beginning, this expectation was not realized.</p>
<h3>U.S. Legislators Meet French Premier</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Premier Ramadier met today with the U.S. Senate committee investigating the situation in Europe. Authoritative sources said Ramadier would explain France's financial recovery measures and their relationship to the U.S. aid plan. The U.S. legislators will also meet with French Finance Minister Schuman and Foreign Minister Bidault.</p>
<h3>U.S. Supports Partition Plan for the Holy Land Different Reactions from Arabs and Jews Arab Troop Concentration Is Exaggerated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] The delegation of six Arab nations attending the U.N. General Assembly issued a statement today expressing surprise at the United States' support for the Palestine partition plan. The declaration stated that if this U.S. policy is implemented, it will undermine the traditional peaceful intentions of the United States. The Arab delegation sincerely hopes that the United States will not take a course of action that is not based on wisdom and justice. It is puzzling that the United States, as a strong nation, has proposed a method that it knows cannot be implemented and will inevitably cause turmoil. The Near East will not be at peace until the Zionist faction abandons its ambitions.</p>
<p>The Arab delegation believes that a peaceful solution is necessary and possible, but the prerequisite is that the United States must advise the Zionist faction that their plan is unworkable and that those who seek a peaceful solution must intensify their efforts. The Arab delegation is confident that the General Assembly will act in accordance with the Charter and will not propose a resolution that would cause conflict.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 11th] According to a London report, Cohen, Secretary-General of the World Zionist Organization, expressed gratitude for the United States' willingness to support partition, and he also advocated that an international army should maintain order in the Holy Land before the establishment of both Arab and Jewish states. Volunteers could be supplied by U.N. member states.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 11th] As a result of a 300-mile aerial inspection by a United Press reporter along the Syrian, Lebanese, and Transjordanian borders today, only four Arab military units were found within 20 miles of the Palestinian border from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea. Two units guarded King Abdullah of Transjordan's winter palace, and two units were stationed on the Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River. Unless they were hidden in caves or disguised as camel caravans, they would not number more than 1,000 men. There are also no signs of troop movements or concentrations in Palestine or abroad, and the border villages and towns are as peaceful as ever.</p>
<h3>Security Council Fails to Reach Agreement on Defining Indonesian Boundary Line Summary of Report Submitted by Consular Corps</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations Security Council failed today to reach a resolution on the suggestion to define the boundary line in Indonesia. After the Soviet representative's suggestion that both sides withdraw to their positions before the conflict was rejected, Australia suggested that the new boundary line should be stipulated as five kilometers behind the positions of both sides when a ceasefire order is issued. British representative Cadogan expressed opposition, and suggested that the Tripartite Mediation Committee and the consular states should stipulate a temporary boundary line as soon as possible. Representatives from France and Belgium expressed their support, and the Netherlands also stated that it did not oppose it. The Council then rescheduled the meeting for Tuesday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 11th] The six-nation consular corps held a special meeting today and decided to telegraph the summary and conclusions of its six weeks of investigation to the Security Council before nightfall.</p>
<h3>Communist International Threatens World Peace France Did Not Participate Bidault Declares at People's Republican Movement Congress</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] French Foreign Minister Bidault said in his address to the People's Republican Movement Congress that the reorganization of the old Communist International, regardless of what name it is using, is another threat to peace. A few people in France also participated, but France did not participate. Bidault also said that the Marshall Plan represents a great event of political wisdom and moral generosity. During my talks in Washington this time, no one had any intention of giving up independence. Some European countries that oppose the Marshall Plan choose poverty, but we will join the Marshall Plan and choose happiness. Bidault expressed France's gratitude to the American people for their voluntary food rationing to aid Europe.</p>
<h3>Landon's Anti-Soviet Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press, Topeka, Kansas, 12th] Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in 1936, gave a speech here on the 12th to veterans who fought against Japan and in the Western Pacific in the Philippines, accusing the "thugs in the Kremlin" of openly building the axis of the next world war. The United States should automatically arm itself as the basis for all considerations. The resurgence of the Communist International is a defensive posture against the Marshall Plan. "The Soviet Union is following in the footsteps of organizing an axis, and is clearly stating that it will not abandon its imperialistic goals, but will openly restore the Communist International and attempt to expand it."</p>
<h3>French Plane Shot Down French Deputy Chief of Staff Dies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hanoi, 11th] Officials announced today that Viet Minh anti-aircraft gunners hit a French transport plane over Bac Kan City. The plane, which was carrying paratroopers, crashed into the mountainside, killing 15 people, including the French Deputy Chief of Staff in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Taft to Join Presidential Race</h3>
<p>[United Press, Columbus, 11th] Republican leaders expect Senator Taft to announce his candidacy for president next year on October 24.</p>
<h3>Truman Appoints Large Number of Army and Air Force Officers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] President Truman appointed 5,900 Army and Air Force officers on the 10th, bringing the number of post-war officers to 40,000. Among those appointed today, 4,000 are Air Force officers. This reflects the U.S.'s emphasis on building a strong air force. It is reported that the U.S. government will soon appoint another 10,000 new officers.</p>
<h3>Britain to Massively Reduce Troops Plan to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] Britain plans to massively reduce its troops again, which will be announced in late this month.

The government will announce the plan it has made after Congress resumes on the 20th of this month, ordering the national army to be reduced to within a million by next March. According to a senior official, there will be a further substantial reduction by March of the year after next.</p>
<h3>Left and Right Wings of Italy Launch Struggle in Rome City Council Elections</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 12th] The struggle between Catholicism and Communism is heating up in the Rome city elections on the 12th, with an expected 700,000 people voting.

<h3>Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Other Countries May Form a United Anti-Communist Front; Chile Discloses Secret Letters of Southern Country Personnel</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 11th (Associated Press)] Diplomatic circles here say that Argentina, Brazil, and Chile may soon form a united front to resist international communism.

<h3>Opposition Between Left and Right Factions in Japanese Miners' Union</h3>
<p>General Federation Faction Withdraws from Union</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The National Federation of Coal Miners' Unions, representing 370,000 miners in Japan, split into two factions today. Representatives of unions leaning towards the government said that they could not cooperate with the Federation (non-democratic leaders) related to the Sanbetsu Kaigi [Congress of Industrial Unions] under Communist control. Therefore, the labor union alliance under the control of the Socialist Party and the miners' unions related to the neutral General Federation of Labor and the Japan Miners' Union, including 220,000 miners, withdrew from the Federation. As a result, only 150,000 anti-government and neutral miners remain in the Federation. Today is the third day of the Federation's national conference. This split was caused by the election of new personnel. The General Federation and the Alliance failed and then withdrew.</p>
<h3>Poles Firmly Believe in Religion; 95 Percent of the Population are Catholics; Communist Party Members Also Bow Their Heads to God - "A Trip to Poland," Sixth Letter by Our Correspondent Mao Shuqing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Warsaw, September 29th (Airmail)] Foreign journalists in Poland often like to ask Poles if they are Communists. I asked a female staff member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and she said charmingly, "Many American journalists say that my thoughts and actions are very red; in fact, I frankly tell them that I am pink, because I am a member of the Polish Democratic Party. Although the Democratic Party also participates in the Communist Party's coalition government, it is not a Communist Party after all!"</p>
<p>She said: The main reason why many Poles are reluctant to join the Communist Party is for religious beliefs. Of the 23 million people in Poland, 95 percent are Catholics belonging to the Vatican, 4 percent belong to the "Greek Orthodox Church," and 1 percent are Muslim, Buddhist, and others. According to Poland's traditional religious beliefs, babies are "baptized" on behalf of their parents, and from then on, they are destined to be Catholics for life. That female secretary has a very "advanced" mind, she said: "This kind of belief is unfair, because the baby itself is ignorant!"</p>
<p>However, most Poles are still devout "good men and women" of the Vatican Catholic Church. I visited a Catholic church called "Alexander" in Warsaw. The altar and prayer hall of the church were destroyed in the street fighting in 1944 and have not been repaired to this day. However, those devout believers still perform "Mass" as usual on Sundays. They kneel and pray in the remaining cellar. The cellar is small, and many people stand in line outside the door.</p>
<p>In such a country with a devout religious force, the ideas and doctrines of the Communist Party are not easy to cater to the psychology of the people.</p>
<p>In Warsaw, there is such a story: On February 1st this year, the first session of the National Assembly after the restoration of Poland was officially opened. On that day, the Communist Party leader Piłsudski was elected as the President of the Republic of Poland, and the presidential oath and ceremony were discussed. Some deputies advocated abolishing the phrase "Obey the will of Almighty God" in the presidential oath. He said: "God is false and illusory. The president must be loyal to the country and serve the people. There is no need for God!" At that time, many Communist Party and Socialist Party deputies applauded in agreement. This angered a Catholic deputy who was non-partisan. He stood up with a flushed face and said, "Ninety-five percent of the people in Poland believe in God. The democratically elected president cannot run counter to the will of the people and cannot disappoint the people!" He also said: "Relying on God is harmless to the country, beneficial to the people, and beneficial to the government." He spoke for more than half an hour, which made many Communist Party deputies admire him. During the vote, it is said that except for some members of the Socialist Party who opposed God, all the Communists and many other small parties agreed to retain the "Almighty God" sentence. Therefore, President Piłsudski, as an old Communist, still solemnly swore on the day of his inauguration: "Obey the will of God."</p>
<p>It is said that on the day the National Assembly was held, Minz, the Minister of Industry, one of the Communist Party giants, and Gomółka, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee, sat in the front row in the left corner of the venue. Minz was not interested in the discussion of the "God case" at all and fell asleep. When the vote was taken, Gomółka woke him up severely and said to him, "You guy, you have committed so many sins in your life, why don't you hurry up and raise your hand to ask for God's forgiveness?" Therefore, Minz also raised his hand in his sleep, adding one vote to "retain the God case"!</p>
<p>If it is said that agricultural society will inevitably produce strong religious beliefs, then the attitude of compromise between the Polish Communist Party and Catholicism is not only realistic, but also wise. At the garden party at the Prime Minister's residence on Poland's National Day, I met a young Mrs. Skulsky, whose name is "Christian." She is the chairman of the Polish National Cooperative Business Association, a member of the National Assembly, and the chief representative of Poland at the London World Cooperative Conference, a female Communist Party member in her thirties. I asked her why she didn't change her name? She laughed loudly: "What does it matter, the Communist Party and Catholicism can coexist without conflict!"</p>
<p>She said: They are now working hard to build a new Poland, and the country's political and economic policies should gradually be transferred to the hands of 30-year-olds. She said: More than 3 million people have become members of cooperative societies led by her. She has also heard that China's cooperative business is booming, and she very much hopes to have the opportunity to visit China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Amazing Revenue from Commodity Tax; Exceeds One Trillion in Two Years; New and Old Directors Will Soon Hand Over</h3>
<p>Fang Dong, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, has been ordered to be transferred to the Director of the Finance Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, and is currently preparing to hand over his duties. Fang was the first Director of the Commodity Tax Bureau in this city after the victory, serving a full two years. In his remarks on the collection of taxes in Shanghai over the past two years, he said: The intellectual level of Shanghai manufacturers is extremely high, and government officials are often inferior to them. They understand their tax obligations, so there is no difficulty in collecting taxes. The total commodity tax collected in the past two years to date has exceeded 1,294 billion yuan. Among the taxed goods, cotton yarn and cigarettes account for the largest number, followed by sugar, and then beer, beverages, and fur. The future of commodity tax revenue in Shanghai is absolutely optimistic, as long as the manufacturers' raw materials are not scarce, there are no labor wage disputes, and tax revenue will definitely be prosperous. The increase in commodity tax revenue is a good sign of industrial and commercial development. It is also learned that Chen Gongliang, the new Director of the Commodity Tax Bureau of this city, will come to Shanghai on the 15th of this month, and the new and old Directors can hand over their duties around the end of the month.</p>

<h3>The People Invented a Machine Tricycle with a Very Satisfactory Test Run; Few Expenses, Many Advantages; The Cost of Assembling One is More Than Ten Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Wang Wentao, a special correspondent in Europe for the Catholic Cultural Association, officially test-drove his recently successfully modified machine tricycle at the Zhongming Factory on Dihua South Road yesterday afternoon. The results were exceptionally satisfactory. The car will be the first machine tricycle to appear in this city.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang once stayed in Europe for more than ten years, and had close contacts with the Italian industrial community. He usually studied various machine industries with great care and gained a lot of experience. After returning to China recently, he felt that most Chinese people lacked understanding of "manufacturing industry." In order to increase the interest of all parties in studying industry, he specially used the small engine he designed and modified in Italy to first modify a tricycle. This engine weighs only seven kilograms and has the same performance as an ordinary car engine, and has many advantages: Very low fuel consumption, one gallon of gasoline can travel more than one hundred miles. It has one and a half horsepower and can carry about four or five passengers. Driving is extremely easy, with only two brakes, fast and slow, and the speed and climbing power are the same as ordinary cars. It is suitable for installation on any existing tricycle without the need for additional modifications. This engine is currently worth 50 US dollars. If it is installed on a 10 million yuan tricycle, the cost is more affordable than a machine bicycle. The above points were observed on-site by Jue Zhonglian, a technician from the Zhongming Factory, during the test run yesterday, and it was considered that all met the standards.</p>
<p>The Zhongming Factory, which assembles the car, is run by Fan Zhengbo. Fan is very enthusiastic about researching industrial construction. The factory can now manufacture engines by itself, but it never sells them. The products produced are only for research and improvement. Wang plans to cooperate with the factory in Shanghai in the future to manufacture this small engine for assembling tricycles. According to industrial figures, the engine is manufactured in this country with excellent technology and the price is low. It can not only earn a large amount of foreign exchange, but the chaotic traffic situation in this city will gradually improve as motorized vehicles gradually replace human-powered vehicles. [The attached picture is the machine tricycle that was test-driven, photographed by our newspaper]</p>
<p>Another Invention by Wang Wentao: Dubbing Foreign Films in Mandarin</p>
<p>In addition to the machine tricycle, Wang also has the work of dubbing foreign films in Mandarin, and the test has also been completed. This dubbing is different from the simple explanation of the plot in the "free translation style", but all the sounds, dialogues and actions in the film are dubbed in Mandarin. The Mandarin-dubbed film "A Night to Remember" that Wang brought back from Italy is scheduled to be shown to the public at the Grand Shanghai Theater at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. He plans to integrate opinions from all parties and mass-produce foreign films with rich educational awareness in Mandarin in the future, so as to promote the progress of China's electrified education.</p>
<h3>Observations on Visiting China by Prentiss - Continued from Second Edition</h3>
<p>The only means of transportation available to them to communicate with the south is a dilapidated railway, with Communist forces lurking and threatening within mere miles on either side of the road. Their situation is so perilous that it would keep any European or American soldier on edge, unable to sleep soundly. Yet, they remain calm, firmly believing they can repel any Communist attacks on Changchun. Even if their connection to the south is entirely severed, they are confident they can hold their ground and await reinforcements.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of the war, the Chinese government must not retreat from the Northeast, and</p>
<p>Regardless of the Price, They Must Strive to Dispatch Troops to Reinforce Northeast China. Should the Northeast be abandoned or seized by the Communist forces, a series of misfortunes for China will follow.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for us to foresee that the Communist Party will immediately declare the "independence" of the "Northeast People's Republic," or that this "republic" will be recognized by the "Independent Republic of Outer Mongolia," as it is entirely under Soviet control. Subsequently, the two "independent republics" will sign a "mutual assistance treaty." We can also easily imagine Molotov inviting the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union and politely reminding him that the Soviet Union has a mutual assistance treaty with the "People's Republic of Outer Mongolia." Therefore, should the Chinese government attempt to recover the Nine Eastern Provinces by force, Outer Mongolia will come to the aid of the "Northeast People's Republic," and the Soviet Union, based on its treaty relationship with Outer Mongolia, will have no choice but to use force to prevent the Chinese government from attacking the Outer Mongolian army. The Chinese government, intimidated by Soviet intervention, will not dare to attempt to recover the Nine Eastern Provinces. Thus, Stalin's work at Yalta will achieve ultimate success.</p>
<p>He will firmly control the entire Northeast, which is the most fertile territory in Asia. Its area is as large as France and Germany combined. Within its mountains lies an agricultural region as fertile as any in the world, producing large quantities of wheat, corn, soybeans, and all other northern crops. It has rich deposits of coal, iron, and even gold, as well as vast resources of developed and undeveloped water power and forests. Before the war, it accounted for seventy percent of China's total industry, but its population is only forty million, offering a tremendous opportunity for the relocation of surplus Chinese farmers. Therefore, the Northeast is of exceptional importance to China's future development.</p>
<p>The government's troops in the Northeast, due to their American-style equipment, are currently</p>
<p>Lacking Ammunition. This need is extremely urgent and cannot be delayed. Action must be taken immediately. In terms of timing and importance, this issue should be resolved before any effective general assistance to China. Holding the southern part of the Northeast is a prerequisite for any future offensive. We must not prevent the Chinese government from purchasing and transporting ammunition from the United States to meet the needs of its American-style equipment – as a means of coercing</p>
<p>President Chiang to abide by certain constraints, which we now recognize as a grave error. Given the severe shortage of ammunition among the Nationalist forces in the Northeast due to our unwise actions, and given the dire consequences for China—and ultimately for ourselves—of Stalin's control of the Northeast, merely lifting the American embargo on arms to China is not enough. President Truman should take swift action, as President Roosevelt did when Britain and France faced a severe shortage of guns and ammunition after the Dunkirk evacuation. At that time, President Roosevelt deemed some American ammunition to be obsolete, meaning that he declared it no longer suitable for use by the American military. This allowed it to be sold legally, and large quantities of ammunition were sold to Britain for one dime on the dollar. We now have hundreds of thousands of tons of stockpiled ammunition lying unused around the world, rotting and rusting; there are 70,000 tons in the Philippines, even more in Okinawa, and even more in the Aleutian Islands, and a larger quantity in Japan, as well as in the United States. The ammunition from this stockpile that can be used in the Northeast should be declared obsolete and sold to China immediately, and its transport expedited.</p>
<p>President Truman has the power to take this action immediately; he does not need to wait for Congress to reconvene. He can still act in time to prevent the Northeast from falling into Soviet hands. If he does not act, then one of the first steps Congress should take upon reconvening is to investigate our China policy. Such an investigation could at least determine the responsibility and reveal the names of those in our government and overseas personnel who have failed to uphold the vital interests of the American people. If we</p>
<p>Act in Time, we can still prevent the Northeast from falling into Soviet hands, thereby ensuring the territorial integrity of China. But this action, although crucial, is not enough. We must not only maintain China as a free nation, but also ensure that it becomes a whole and powerful nation—capable of acting as a genuine force against Soviet imperialism in the Far East when the time is right. For China to be strong, it must first achieve internal stability, and to achieve internal stability, it must first achieve financial stability.</p>
<p>Today, China has fallen into a vicious cycle, a situation that Europeans became all too familiar with after World War I. China has been at war since 1937. The Japanese occupied almost all of the major cities, financial centers, and industrial areas. All of her financial resources fell into Japanese hands. As a result, she could not support the war effort by issuing bonds, and its tax revenues could only cover a small portion of the war expenses. Consequently, the only way she could pay for the war was to issue paper money.</p>
<p>The government's increased printing of paper money gradually devalued the currency. Prices rose accordingly. All those on fixed incomes began to suffer greatly. Government bonds, savings, insurance policies, and all other forms of wealth except for productive farmland depreciated in value. The savings of the middle class gradually dwindled. In reality, the heavy burden of wartime finance fell on the shoulders of the middle class, leading to a decline in the living standards of soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and those who lived off the fixed interest income from securities. The current situation in China is far less dire than in Germany after World War I, but it is bad enough. According to the current value of the Chinese currency, the present cost of living is about 30,000 times what it was before the Japanese invasion of China in 1936. The wages of urban workers have increased in line with the increase in the cost of living. In Shanghai, thanks to the strength of the labor unions, the living standards of workers are actually two-thirds higher than before the war. However, a person who earned 3,000 yuan in interest income from government bonds in 1936 now has purchasing power equivalent to one dime in 1936. The middle class has been bankrupted, and currently,</p>
<p>Suppressing the Communist rebellion still accounts for about 70 percent of the government's total expenditures, and about two-thirds of the government's expenditures are still financed by printing paper money. As a result, the cost of living continues to rise.</p>
<p>In an effort to reduce war-related expenditures, the government has not increased the salaries of officers and soldiers. A soldier's monthly pay is equivalent to only one and a half US dollars. A major general's monthly income is equivalent to seventeen US dollars. With such meager amounts, they clearly cannot support their families. Therefore, to boost morale and for other reasons, it would be very reasonable to increase the pay of officers and soldiers fourfold. However, with more than four million army personnel, a fourfold increase in salaries would greatly increase government spending, which could only be offset by printing more paper money, which would, in turn, accelerate the current rise in the cost of living.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of civil servants, from political commissioners to tax collectors, it remains at astonishingly low levels. In times of national crisis, it is appropriate for the government to ask all civil and military officials to make sacrifices and contribute to the country. However, the meager treatment of Chinese civil servants has exceeded the limits of human endurance and is producing extremely adverse consequences. The extremely low pay of soldiers constantly reminds them of the growing poverty of their families, which seriously affects their morale. As for officers who cannot support their wives and children on their salaries, if they are virtuous and patriotic, they must sell all their possessions to support their families. But when they have nothing left to sell, they are forced to watch their children go hungry, or to use their positions to engage in corruption, or to commit suicide. In the past, many chose to commit suicide rather than tarnish their reputations, but many officers have also turned to corruption. (Continued on Fifth Edition)</p>
<h3>Dr. Ting Hui-k'ang Invited to Speak on "American Customs and Climate"; City Hospitals in Los Angeles and Schools are Free</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This newspaper held its 28th special Sunday broadcast at the Cooperative Radio Station yesterday, inviting Dr. Ting Hui-k'ang, the Director of Hongqiao Sanatorium, who had just returned from a trip to Italy, to speak on "American Customs and Climate." A summary of his speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>America has been praised by the world after World War II. In fact, the victory was not accidental. From a single bullet to artificial plasma, everything was the result of the entire nation tightening their belts and saving every penny. Americans say that the victor only knows blood and tears, which is not an exaggeration. This trip covered more than 30,000 miles, and what I am about to describe is only a fraction of what I saw. When our ship arrived in San Francisco, the first thing that caught our eye was the Golden Gate Bridge, standing majestically in the sea, beyond description. Beyond this is the Bay Bridge, the longest bridge in the world, spanning seven miles and wide enough for six cars to drive abreast. The scale of the project is unimaginable. However, the cost of building the bridge was raised by merchants, with the government only playing a supervisory role. In the past, each car crossing the bridge had to pay a dollar. Since its completion nine years ago, half of the construction costs have been recovered, and now the toll has been reduced to fifty cents each time. Up to 100,000 vehicles travel daily, saving people time and enabling countless individuals to engage in social construction. Therefore, although the construction cost of the bridge is enormous, the intangible benefits to the nation are immeasurable. This is an example of cooperation between the government and the people in that country.</p>

<p>San Francisco did not exist initially. It was built by clearing mountains. The slope of its roads often reaches over forty degrees. A hundred years ago, it suffered a major fire, destroying most of the city. However, its facilities today are more advanced, and it has become a hub for east-west traffic. Los Angeles, which was originally a desolate fishing village a hundred years ago, is now known as the world's largest city! Located about five hundred miles south of San Francisco, it sits majestically on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Although the area is sandy and arid, it is evergreen all year round, free from the encroachment of severe cold and frost. When we visited the area in January of this year, the flowers were blooming like in the height of spring. Therefore, there are indeed many who choose to build villas here, mainly because its excellent climate is rare. Hollywood, the birthplace of the American film industry and one of the eight major industries in the United States, is located in the northern part of Los Angeles. Its residential areas are clean, tidy, and beautiful, creating an urbanized park. Los Angeles is surrounded by mountains, and the nearby seaside hot springs and other scenic spots are must-see destinations for tourists.</p>
<p>Almost Every Resident Owns a Car</p>
<p>Although Los Angeles is vast in area, it is newly developed. The population is only about three million, but there are over 1.5 million cars. Almost every resident owns a car. This not only shows the average wealth but also the general development of knowledge, physical strength, and the convenience of transportation. Parents of school-age children who do not attend school will be punished. All municipal elementary and secondary schools are free of charge. Not only that, but even tram tickets and book expenses are also waived. In Los Angeles, there are 4,000 municipal elementary and secondary schools. In addition to books, the curriculum includes practical skills such as woodworking, pottery making, typesetting, and printing. Mr. Hu Shih once said that if all specialized academic positions must be learned from foreign countries, then our country's school education has clearly not succeeded. Therefore, there is a proposal to reform our country's university system, which can be said to be a profound statement. I have visited the Universities of California, Harvard, Cornell, Columbia, and Boston, observing the history of their evolution, the ebb and flow of various departments, which are not achieved in a day or two. As for the magnificent architecture, it is just a bonus.</p>
<p>Splendid and Grand, Like a Palace</p>
<p>Los Angeles City Hospital can accommodate three thousand patients. The entire building was completed only eight years ago. It is splendid and grand, resembling a palace. Its inscriptions read: "Maintaining health is the true joy of life"; and "Public health is the true wealth of society." From this, we can see that it spends a large amount of money to build hospitals entirely for the benefit of the people. Looking at the entire hospital, there are no privileged wards; all are ordinary wards. Its magnificent architecture makes it known as the world's number one municipal hospital. Most people in the United States can live and work in peace and enjoy free access to hospitals, receiving accurate diagnoses and early treatment, so that they can recover their health and engage in production. This benefits both the family and the country. On this trip abroad, there were several students from St. John's University. Although they were all wealthy, their physiques were far inferior to others, most being sallow and thin. Half a year later, when we met again, the students' faces were rosy and they had gained a lot of weight. Our Chinese cuisine is known as the best in the world, but the nutrition of our diet has been a complete failure. This proves it.</p>
<p>Constantly Striving for Perfection and Innovation</p>
<p>The so-called new medical scholars can be summed up in one sentence: "Examination medicine." A hospital often has more than a dozen X-ray machines and more than ten operating rooms. Diagnosis is widespread and advanced, so it can be innovated every day and every month. For example, the direction of blood circulation in the heart can now be obtained through X-ray photography. Also, diseases such as lung cancer and tuberculosis, which were once thought to be hopeless, can now be accurately diagnosed through precise examinations. Any lobe of the lung can be completely removed surgically. Once the virus is gone, health can be restored. The surgical department of the New York Seaside Sanatorium has performed complete lung lobe removal surgery on more than forty people, with excellent results.</p>
<p>Rapid Progress is Not Accidental</p>
<p>Before my departure, I specially visited General Chief of Staff Ho Ying-chin and his wife at Long Island in New York. After lunch, we continued with tea and conversation. Mrs. Ho said: "Why do American doctors repeatedly introduce me to different doctors, and the doctors do not prescribe any medicine to treat my illness?" I replied: "Does the motto of Great China University not say 'Public and Sincere'? American doctors are openly researching and sincerely serving Mrs. Ho's illness, and that is all!" Looking at the rapid progress of construction in America, it is not accidental. It is all based on profound science, sound physical fitness, unity, and dedication. The people are the atoms of the country. If the atoms are on the verge of extinction, then where does the construction of the country come from? Now that our country has won the war against Japan, it is an urgent task to fight disease and save our weak nation. I sincerely hope that all sages at home and abroad will rise up together to pursue this goal.</p>

<h3>Impressions of China from Mr. Bullitt - Continued from Page 4</h3>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>The meager salaries paid to civil servants are the main cause of corruption in China today. This corruption is so widespread that it cannot escape the notice of impartial observers. In the military, there are many forms of corruption, the simplest being the practice of drawing pay for nonexistent soldiers. A general can falsely report 25 percent more soldiers than he actually has, collect their pay and rations, sell the rations, and pocket the money, sharing it with his trusted officers. The actual number of soldiers in the Chinese army may not exceed 70 percent of what is listed on the payroll. The efficiency and integrity of Chinese customs officials were among the best in the world before 1937, but now corruption is also prevalent. There are still many who</p>
<p>keep themselves clean,</p>
<p>but most are just waiting for the opportunity to "skim the cream." Tax collectors of all kinds are mostly corrupt. An honest Chinese businessman should pay the government 10,000 yuan in taxes. If he pays the full amount without haggling, his position is very precarious. The collector insists on extorting money, putting 5,000 yuan into his own pocket and paying 2,500 yuan to the government. However, if the businessman does not bribe him, the collector will report him, falsely accusing him of falsifying accounts and owing 30,000 yuan in taxes. This will cause the businessman to lose his reputation and spend money on lengthy lawsuits. Although Chinese judges are paid very little and have difficulty making a living, they generally endure hardship and keep themselves clean. However, there are also corrupt judges; no small matter is free from the taint of corruption. In China, middle school and university diplomas must go through a registration process, so the registration staff comes up with all sorts of excuses to delay registration until they have skimmed a little off each diploma.</p>
<p>Most of these people live corrupt lives. The only possible way to stop this corruption now is to give all civil and military officials a salary that allows them to make a living, and execute all those who continue to be corrupt.</p>
<p>But raising the salaries of government officials will increase inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation</p>
<p>will raise the cost of living, and the rising cost of living will quickly render salary increases ineffective, and corruption will still be difficult to avoid—in the end, no one will benefit. How can China break this vicious cycle?</p>
<p>There is only one final answer to this problem, and that is to end the war. But if the vicious cycle prevents China from waging an effective war, then how can victory be achieved?</p>
<p>This is where the United States needs to step in and help. We can break this vicious cycle from several angles, and the price we pay, measured by the benefits we gain in security, will still be small.</p>
<p>At present, the most surprising fact in China is not in the realm of war or politics, but in the realm of finance. The amount of money spent by the Chinese government, when converted into US dollars at the current exchange rate, is simply negligible. The Chinese government governs a population of 450 million people in an area one-third larger than the United States, and bears all the costs of war, but its annual expenditure is only the same as that of the New York City government.</p>
<p>The total expenditure of the Chinese government in 1947, calculated at the current exchange rate, is approximately one billion US dollars. This is a fact. Theoretically, trillions of Chinese legal tender can be completely recovered with only 250 million US dollars at the current exchange rate. This is also a fact. In other words, if we were willing to bear the entire annual expenditure of the Chinese government—of course we would not do that, but theoretically it is possible—it would only increase our expenditure by one billion US dollars. If we were willing to recover all the newly issued banknotes in China with gold and silver—of course we would not do that, theoretically but not practically, we could do it—it would be to lend China gold or silver worth 250 million US dollars. The importance of these figures lies in only one reason, which is that they prove that</p>
<p>effective aid to China</p>
<p>is within our capabilities. We are capable of breaking the vicious cycle of inflation in China without bankrupting ourselves.</p>
<p>Before we continue to discuss the issue of aid, let us remember that war cannot be won by force alone; it also depends on the spirit of fighting, patriotic fervor, and great political leadership to awaken all the material and spiritual strength of the country. What is the current political leadership in China like? Does it have the ability to mobilize the exhausted and hungry people of the country to engage in new self-sacrifice?</p>
<p>The people who led China in great construction between 1928 and 1937, and who led China in the heroic War of Resistance, are the leaders of China today. Few now doubt the integrity, patriotic zeal, and good intentions of the government ministers, or the outstanding talents of some ministers—like Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei. But general criticism of the government is very common. Why is this?</p>
<p>In today's world, no people are as deeply disappointed as the Chinese. The Chinese people were confident that once the Japanese were driven out, they would have peace. They never expected that after Japan's defeat, the Soviet Union would immediately attempt to use the Chinese Communists to destroy their country's independence and enslave them. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, the Chinese Communists seemed to be only a very weak band of bandits, confined to a corner of Shaanxi Province. At that time, the Communist army only had 30,000 men, and they rarely fought the Japanese army, except for shouting slogans and propaganda. Most of their troops were used to attack the rear of the National Army and seize their weapons, so their behavior in the spring of 1945 was very hateful.</p>
<p>But as a result, the Communist army gained enormous benefits during the War of Resistance against Japan. While the National Army was fighting the Japanese army, they were expanding their forces, so when Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, they had about 300,000 armed guerrillas distributed throughout North China. At that time, there was not a single Communist soldier in Northeast China. However, after the Soviet government occupied Northeast China after Japan's surrender, it began to rush Communist personnel into Northeast China and armed them with Japanese weapons. In Northeast China, the Communist army not only recruited local farmers, but also recruited Koreans. Now their strength is close to 350,000 men. They have about 400,000 troops scattered throughout North China, forming small guerrilla units. Now the exhausted, weary, and peace-loving Chinese people have received war, heavy taxes, and ever-rising living expenses and death. They desire peace. Because they cannot get peace, they blame the government. When people in various countries find that their original hopes have been dashed after the end of a major war, they often turn against their</p>
<p>wartime leaders</p>
<p>—the opposition to Churchill and De Gaulle are recent examples. Therefore, in the current situation in China, no government can satisfy the public. The corruption and incompetence of the administrative staff further undermine the government's reputation. However, apart from Communists and their fellow travelers, even the most vehement critics of the government have never said anything bad about President Chiang Kai-shek personally. They acknowledge his contributions to the country, which are unparalleled by anyone in modern history except for Dr. Sun Yat-sen. They acknowledge his personal integrity, honesty, and single-minded devotion to the country. But they also say that his knowledge is limited, that he does not understand the current state of the country, that he listens too much to the old men who helped him twenty years ago, that he has been in high office for too long, so no one dares to speak frankly with him anymore, that his habits and attitudes have been fixed, and that he cannot change his policies or replace his close advisors, so he cannot cope with the terrible new problems facing China today. But "who should replace him?" The answer to this question is always the same: "No one can replace him."</p>
<p>Those who love China earnestly hope that President Chiang Kai-shek can implement the following</p>
<p>reforms:</p>
<p>1.  Retire half of the army generals and one-third of the officers below the rank of general. These are the people who are considered corrupt or incompetent, or both.</p>
<p>2.  Reduce the number of army personnel by half. First, eliminate all nonexistent soldiers in the army. Second, eliminate the lowest-quality units.</p>
<p>3.  Increase the salaries of the remaining officers and soldiers by four times and double their rations.</p>
<p>4.  After the officers and soldiers receive salaries sufficient to make a living, execute all those who continue to be corrupt.</p>
<p>5.  Abolish all redundant and useless institutions in the government and dismiss all unnecessary civil servants. It is generally estimated that this measure can reduce the number of existing civil servants by one-third.</p>
<p>6.  Give the remaining civil servants a salary that allows them to make a living, and execute all officials who are corrupt thereafter.</p>
<p>7.  The government should stop operating industrial and commercial enterprises, because state-owned enterprises will inevitably lead to nepotism, inefficiency, and corruption. Sell the state's existing industries to the highest bidder and truly encourage private enterprise.</p>
<p>8.  Welcome foreign investment—be consistent in word and deed.</p>
<p>9.  Decentralize the power of the central government. Within the entire area south of the Yangtze River, reduce the number of armed forces and the power of military institutions to the minimum extent that does not harm national security. Reassign power to civilian provincial governors, allow provincial governments to directly collect at least 25 percent of land taxes for their own use, and allow them to decide on local plans for their respective provinces.</p>
<p>10. Reform land taxes and all other taxes, stipulate severe penalties, and demand absolute integrity from tax collectors.</p>
<p>11. Hire foreign experts to guide the reform of the tax system, tax collection, the revision of financial policies, and the proposal of industrial problems.</p>
<p>12. Force all people with</p>
<p>foreign deposits</p>
<p>or gold to surrender their foreign exchange and gold to the national treasury. Arrest and imprison all wealthy people who attempt to evade this measure or who refuse to pay all of their taxes.</p>
<p>13. Strictly implement the conscription law. The sons of wealthy families should be treated the same as farmers.</p>
<p>14. Abolish student deferments. Immediately draft all students who work for the Communists in the war against the Communists—the Communists and their fellow travelers, who now account for about 5 percent of the total number of students—and give them re-education before sending them to the front lines. Allow patriotic students to hold speeches criticizing the government and organize demonstrations.</p>
<p>15. In the administrative institutions of Northeast China, employ as many Northeasterners as possible.</p>
<p>16. Publicize the facts of the Soviet Red Army's atrocities in Northeast China, such as rape and looting. The government has been forbidding the publication of these facts in the past out of fear of the Soviet Union. And publicize the many pieces of evidence in the government's possession about the Chinese Communists' obedience to Moscow.</p>
<p>17. Publicize the facts of smuggling from Hong Kong to China, which is greatly reducing customs revenue.</p>
<p>18. Hold national elections in October and December. After the implementation of the democratic constitution, end, in practice and in name, the Kuomintang's "tutelage period" established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>This plan would undoubtedly win the support of all the Chinese people, and if the United States could provide some assistance, this plan would definitely be implemented.</p>
<p>The new democratic constitution of the Republic of China, passed by the National Assembly on December 25, 1946, will be implemented on Christmas Day this year. The Kuomintang (the ruling party) will undoubtedly win the majority of votes, and President Chiang Kai-shek will certainly be re-elected as the President of the Republic of China. Therefore, without interrupting the continuity of the government, the</p>
<p>US government</p>
<p>can now coordinate with President Chiang Kai-shek's plan to end the war and restore China's ancient culture to a peaceful and modern path. How should we proceed? Neither China undertaking internal reforms without US assistance, nor the US providing assistance without China undertaking internal reforms, can solve the problem of safeguarding important US interests, nor can it solve the problem of China's survival. The US government and the Chinese government must work together simultaneously to solve this problem.</p>
<p>We must immediately address this problem in three areas: (1) economy and finance; (2) military affairs; and (3) politics. Given that the essence of the problem is to drive every armed Communist out of Chinese territory, we can only base a sensible plan on an estimate of the time required to end the war. US military experts believe that, given the difficulty of encircling and suppressing guerrillas in vast mountainous areas, it will take three years to end the war. The Chinese people are more optimistic. But let us agree with the US estimate for the sake of argument and present an outline of a three-year plan, while estimating the cost of this plan.</p>
<p>(1) China's gold and foreign exchange reserves have been greatly reduced, so it must retain its existing reserves for the most urgent needs. In the next three years, China will need to import large quantities of American cotton, tobacco, wheat, oil, gasoline, and large quantities of machinery such as locomotives, rails, and truck parts.</p>
<p>The amount of money China needs to import the above items will far exceed the total amount of foreign exchange earned from its exports and the assistance of the World Grain Organization. Therefore, it will need to obtain</p>
<p>credit loans</p>
<p>to purchase food, raw materials, and machinery. According to estimates by Chinese and American economic experts, the maximum amount of these necessary loans is usually 250 million US dollars per year—this is a small portion of the economic assistance needed by European countries. Let us reduce this figure to 200 million US dollars for the sake of argument, so the budget for this entire three-year plan should be 600 million US dollars in credit loans for China to purchase goods from the US from this year to the fall of 1950.</p>
<p>If China sells the food, raw materials, and machinery it obtains in this way on the market, it will help curb the trend of inflation. After the military and civil service have been reduced in size, the remaining civil and military officials can receive four times their current salaries without causing a direct increase in inflation. This is essential to curbing corruption. Since it is the common task of the Chinese and American governments to prevent Stalin from dominating China, there is no reason why the use of these credit loans should not be jointly managed by the Chinese and American governments. The Chinese side should sign the application, and a representative of the US government should co-sign it, in order to use the credit loans.</p>
<p>Since General Wedemeyer made a public statement criticizing corruption in China, the decline in the</p>
<p>value of Chinese legal tender</p>
<p>has become even more severe, because people mistakenly believe that General Wedemeyer's statement indicates that the US government no longer cares about China. It is obvious that unless the US government can quickly express its intention to not tolerate Stalin's occupation of China with actions and words, inflation will soon run wild like a runaway horse. If China wants to curb inflation, it currently needs a portion of the loan we have been considering, about 75 million US dollars. The remaining amount of the 200 million US dollars (i.e., the amount to be used in the first year of the three-year plan) can wait for Congress to decide. This 75 million US dollars, whether it is spent from the US Foreign Aid Program, from the Export-Import Bank, or from other sources, must be lent to China within the next thirty days. Otherwise, we will have to deal with an even greater vicious inflation problem in China next spring. In order to solve inflation during the three-year plan, in order to curb speculators, and to maintain China's balance of international payments, another sum of money is needed in addition to the above. But this sum of money must also be jointly managed by China and the US. Before deciding on this sum, we must insist on a condition that a certain corrupt atmosphere that encourages inflation must end.</p>
<p>For example, the central bank provides funds and credit loans to some other banks, and these banks re-lend the funds to private individuals for seemingly legitimate commercial purposes. Many of these people use the loans to buy goods, gold bars, or US dollars on the black market, and then take the opportunity to sell them when the legal tender depreciates, earning legal tender. Then they use a portion of the money they sell to repay the loan, and keep the rest for themselves. Those in power become rich as a result, while the general public in China suffers greatly.</p>
<p>If the Chinese government is determined to severely punish and completely prohibit the</p>
<p>speculative behavior</p>
<p>of the few bankers and many borrowers who specialize in this kind of activity, then formulating an exchange equalization fund will be beneficial. The use of this fund must be co-signed by a representative of the US government, and this fund should not be established until speculative behavior has been curbed. Let us assume that the Chinese government will definitely take immediate and effective measures against speculative merchants, then it is planned to allocate 150 million US dollars for the exchange equalization fund in the entire three-year plan.</p>
<p>Now let us talk about military affairs. We must remember that before Congress can begin to consider the issue of aid to China, the President should declare the abandonment of a portion of munitions and immediately supply this abandoned munitions to the</p>
<p>Northeast National Army</p>
<p>because their American equipment is severely lacking in the supply of munitions. This action cannot be delayed any longer. If it is delayed, next spring we may find that the Northeast has become a vassal state of the Soviet Union, and that the Communists are poised to occupy an area that before the war contained 70 percent of China's industrial strength, as a base for conquering the rest of China.</p>
<p>According to estimates by authoritative military experts from China and the US, in order to drive out the 350,000 Communist troops in the Northeast, we need not only to re-equip several divisions of troops that have used up their US weapons, but also to train and equip ten new divisions of US-style troops. In addition, it is very important to thoroughly streamline the supply system in the Northeast, from the supply centers to the soldiers fighting on the front lines. Dalian, an important port in the Northeast, can no longer be used, because it is currently occupied by the Soviet army due to the Yalta Agreement. Therefore, the improvement of the ports of Huludao and Qinhuangdao, and the restoration of at least one railway, will be crucial. As we demonstrated in France in 1944, a few hundred people can handle this problem with high efficiency. China lacks this kind of talent, and it would be a waste to transfer US supplies to the Chinese-run supply system before corruption in the Chinese army has been eliminated. Americans cannot overstep their authority and command the Chinese army, but American soldiers can and should manage the supply affairs of the Northeast.</p>
<p>The North China problem</p>
<p>is a problem of guerrilla warfare, because the Communists in that area do not occupy large cities, but are mainly saboteurs. Dealing with this situation requires lightly equipped, lightning-fast units, equipped with Jeeps, small trucks, small arms, machine guns, and 75 mm mortars. According to authoritative military experts from China and the US who have studied this problem, 20 divisions so equipped, properly trained, supplied, and commanded, would definitely be able to clear up the entire North China situation.</p>
<p>Even a minimal air force will be of enormous help in military operations in North China and Northeast China. We have thousands of abandoned aircraft and aircraft parts, which are considered useless from the perspective of our air force, but which are excellent materials in China's eyes. Declaring these materials abandoned and then allocating them to China does not cost our country a penny, but is merely a bookkeeping entry. If we sell them to China at a value of five cents for every dollar of original cost, we have already made money, because these materials are worthless to us.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: the total cost to the US for the military aspect of the three-year plan will depend on how we dispose of abandoned materials. Abandoned weapons and munitions are worthless except as scrap metal. If we want the Chinese to pay five cents or ten cents for every dollar of original cost, and estimate the total value of military assistance on that basis, then the total cost is very low. But it will cost a considerable price in terms of transporting oil, gasoline, food, the compensation of American transport personnel, and the training and advice during combat. We cannot estimate this until the entire plan is finalized, and even a rough estimate is impossible. But if the method of disposing of abandoned materials is implemented, then the annual cost will not exceed 200 million US dollars, and the total cost for the entire three-year plan will not exceed 600 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Adding the 600 million US dollars in credit loans and the 150 million US dollars for the currency stabilization fund, our total cost in the three-year plan will be 1.35 billion US dollars, i.e., an annual cost of 450 million US dollars for the next three years. If we use this money as the price to prevent Stalin from</p>
<p>dominating China</p>
<p>and using China's resources and manpower to oppose us, then the cost is not too high.</p>
<p>But unless the Chinese can not only win on the battlefield, but also revitalize their political life, inspire a new spirit throughout the country, and raise the morale of the army, all the above assistance will have no effect. Can we help them do this? Will our suggestions be regarded as impolite? They will not be regarded as impolite as long as these suggestions are formulated by appropriate people in an appropriate manner. If these suggestions are fair and equitable, then just as the British government was happy to accept our suggestions before the Pearl Harbor incident, the Chinese government will certainly be equally happy to accept them. Many Americans appear arrogant. When they arrive in China, they mix American power, might, strength, and dominance with their own personalities, and they look down on the Chinese everywhere. However, in terms of true human standing, the Chinese are far superior to them. Historically speaking, President Chiang Kai-shek is greater than any American alive today. Future generations will remember that President Chiang Kai-shek and Churchill were both courageous leaders who were able to unite their countries in the darkest times, and China's dark times were even darker than Britain's. If we want to safeguard important US interests and defend the life of China, there must be the closest cooperation between Americans and Chinese. But which American has the military knowledge, political talent, and great personality to engage in this kind of cooperation?</p>
<p>Today we have a general of authority in the Far East who possesses all these qualities. If President Truman could send General MacArthur, in addition to his existing duties and powers, with the title of Personal Representative of the President with the rank of Ambassador, to China to formulate a</p>
<p>joint plan</p>
<p>with President Chiang Kai-shek to prevent the Soviet Union from conquering China, then the entire Far East would be filled with hope and appear bright. General MacArthur does not have to abandon his work in Japan. He can travel between Tokyo and Nanjing. His suggestions on military, economic, and political matters may be similar to those presented in this report. He will certainly quickly connect with President Chiang Kai-shek and become two comrades on the same front. They will be able to work together like brothers for their common goal.</p>
<p>This goal is a common goal. If China falls into Stalin's grasp, then all of Asia, including Japan, will sooner or later be swallowed by him. By that time, Stalin will mobilize Asian manpower and resources to deal with us. American independence will certainly not last longer than Chinese independence by an era. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Physical Society Closed Yesterday; Air Force Demonstrates Radar; Ge Zhengquan Lectures on "Applications of Radar"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the annual meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region of the Chinese Physical Society. At 9 AM, a public lecture was held at the Central Research Institute on Yueyang Road. Dr. Ge Zhengquan, Director of the First Department of the Sixth [illegible] of the Ministry of National Defense, lectured on "Applications of Radar." Before 9 AM, association members had already arrived. Shi Ruwei, chairman of the public lecture, delivered a speech, stating that the Physical Society not only researches and develops physics, but also deeply combines the meaning of popularizing science. Then, Dr. Ge gave a lecture, explaining in detail the principles of radar, the main structural components, and how it is applied in the military. The word "Radar" is a transliteration from English, and its meaning is an abbreviation of the first letters of the words "a radio method to measure distance and azimuth," so its function is to use radio to detect direction and distance. To make it easier for the audience to understand, he showed slides with detailed explanations. Dr. Ge also said that after the victory, the government has received 150 Japanese radar sets in Taiwan and more than 10 sets in Beijing. Currently, 60 to 70 sets have been repaired and can be used. In the future, the Chinese people's research on radar is just beginning. At the same time, the Chinese Air Force set up a radar set on the roof of the Research Institute to demonstrate its actual application, and sent a plane to fly around the city. The radar was able to "capture" the plane's trajectory at any time and report its distance and azimuth. If a distant plane is detected, the green cathode on the "rangefinder" in the darkroom will pulsate strongly, and a white dot will appear on the plane azimuth meter, showing the number of planes, distance, azimuth, etc. If the azimuth measured per minute is recorded and plotted, the trajectory can be fully understood. At noon, the Municipal Government held a public banquet at the Police Social Center on Shaoxing Road. At 2 PM in the afternoon, they visited the radar equipment on the Taiping warship. At 7 PM in the evening, the annual banquet was held at the Sino-British Cultural Association on the fourth floor of HSBC. The annual meeting of the Physics Society, which was a great success, was declared closed after the lunch banquet.</p>
<p>Discussing Physics Education</p>
<p>[Another report] The annual meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region of the Chinese Physical Society held a symposium at the Chinese Science Society on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 11th) to discuss Chinese physics education and physics research. The opinions of various parties were summarized as follows: (A) Regarding general physics in universities, four points: 1. It is not necessary to rigidly stipulate that general physics in universities should be studied for one or two years. 2. University physics experiments must have middle school physics experiment preparation, so it is appropriate to follow the example of the Shanghai Science Museum and set up experimental halls in each county. 3. Middle school physics education has a close relationship with the study of physics in universities, so middle school physics textbooks should be carefully selected. 4. University physics courses should focus on in-depth reading rather than reading too much. (B) Regarding the popularization of physics education, three points: 1. Please invite experts to give more public and popular lectures and publish popular articles. 2. Mass-produce simple teaching aids for public demonstrations. 3. Massively utilize movies to deeply and widely instill knowledge in the masses. (C) Regarding physics research, six points: 1. The work of Chinese physicists in the last fifty years should be compiled into a detailed table for reference. 2. Independent research and group research should communicate with each other. 3. Use the existing institutions with better equipment to first restore small-scale research, and then gradually promote it to industrialize research. 4. First seek life stability and ask the government and society to pay attention. 5. Request subsidies from the National Defense Science Committee and the Materials Supply Committee. 6. Raise a large research fund.</p>
<h3>Peking University Students Support Those Arrested; Surround Hu Shi's Residence; Suddenly Realize the Truth After Explaining the Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th] Hu Shi, President of Peking University, is scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 12th to attend the meeting of the Research Institute. A small number of students at Peking University, in order to support Meng Xian gong and Li Mu Shi, students of the school who were arrested for breaking up a critical Communist agency in the city, gathered over a hundred students around 7 PM on the afternoon of the 10th to surround Hu's residence to make demands. Hu was discussing school affairs with the deans of the Law and Science faculties and the three directors of Peking University. He indicated to the students who came to see him: "Such gathering and making demands is an illegal act. No matter how long you surround me, I will not say a single word or receive any student representatives." After Zheng, the Secretary-General of Peking University, went outside to explain Hu's solemn attitude to the students, the students elected seven representatives, and the rest dispersed. Hu, seeing that the majority of the students had dispersed and were no longer engaging in threatening behavior, received the student representatives. First, he informed them that his trip to Beijing had been scheduled long ago. Second, he said that the case of the arrested students at the school was serious and explained the details of the case. Finally, he stated that the school authorities had already released those arrested students who could be released, and those who could not be released would be asked to be treated favorably by the arresting authorities and provided with defense lawyers or legal counsel during the trial. After learning the details, the student representatives suddenly realized the truth and left. The entire process lasted for over two hours. After hearing the news, all parties expressed their concern and admiration for President Hu.</p>

In order to unify the forms, it is ordered that from now until the 20th of this month, they should be registered directly with Mr. Jin at the Accounting Office of the Bureau of Education to arrange for uniform printing, so as to facilitate reporting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Military Training Student Model Brigade Organizes Alumni Association, Inaugural Meeting Scheduled for the 15th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Ten years ago, during the "August 13th" Songhu War of Resistance, General Wang Jingjiu, commander of the 71st Army, was ordered by the highest military authority to gather military training students from various sessions to form the "Shanghai Military Training Student Model Brigade." At that time, more than 400 students participated, including more than 40 female students. The brigade was directly commanded by General Wang Jingjiu and participated in the defense of Shanghai alongside various military training brigades of the Special Operations Detachment. They fought fiercely amidst gunfire and bullets on the front lines of Dachang, Zhabei, Suzhou Creek, and Nanshi, with considerable casualties. As the National Army retreated westward and the battle lines shifted, the students retreated with the army. While passing through Hangzhou on the eve of its fall, General Xuan Tiewu, then the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, strongly urged them to stay and, with the consent of General Wang Jingjiu, reorganized them into a "Cadre Training Class" jointly run by the department and the 10th Reserve Division, the predecessor of the 10th Army, providing military officer education. After graduation, they were assigned to various units and subsequently participated in battles in Fuyang, Xindeng, protecting Jiujiang, counterattacking Nanchang, protecting Guangzhou, the Changsha Campaign, the India-Burma Expeditionary Force, and protecting Hengyang. More than 40 were killed or wounded in action. Among the brigade's students were those who pursued studies in the air force, cavalry, artillery, infantry, engineering, and chemical warfare schools, or those who returned to their original university studies after demobilization, and those who were about to go abroad for further studies. There were many talented individuals. Those who serve in education, youth, culture, and business have also made considerable achievements. Recently, feeling a close connection with comrades who fought side by side in the past, students initiated the "Shanghai Student Model Brigade and Zhejiang Provincial Security Department Cadre Training Class Alumni Association," scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on October 15th. All students who were members of the brigade or participated in Zhejiang can register to participate from now on at the following addresses: No. 299 Daming Road, Comrade Zhang Hongci; No. 406 Jiujiang Road, Gongxin Bank, Comrade Xiao Jijie; c/o Jiang Yanwu, Command Headquarters of the Songhu Garrison.</p>
<h3>Fudan Economic Canteen Holds Regular Charity Performances to Raise Funds</h3>

Once the youth canteen is officially established and opens for meals, the school's Economic Canteen will be closed.</p>
<h3>China United Wins Fifth Match, Big Victory Over Siam United Team, 7-1 Victory Becomes One-Sided</h3>
<p>(Bangkok, 3rd, Airmail) The Shanghai China United Football Team played its fifth match here yesterday, meeting the Siam United Team at the National Sports Ground. The audience was larger than ever, estimated at around 20,000. China United, familiar with the field after playing the Four Universities United Team, fully revealed its prowess and controlled the game. As a result, they defeated Siam United Team by a score of 7-1.</p>
<p>When the time came, referee Mr. Ma officiated. Siam United's center back A Tie was absent, so they played with ten men. The Siam team attacked first, fiercely battling under the China United's goal. Gao Baozheng cleared the danger with a back-heel kick. The China United team counterattacked, with all three lines advancing. Fei Chunhua kicked a corner kick with excellent placement. Baozheng headed it in, scoring the first goal. Shortly after, the China United team launched another encirclement attack. Yi Chen and Longhai missed good opportunities, but Li Kui was unwilling to give up. He made a high lob from the left corner, and the Siam goalkeeper was tricked and lost the goal, making it 2-0. Afterwards, China United's offensive slightly weakened, but the defense remained solid, and the Siam team found it difficult to recover the lost ground, ultimately falling behind 0-2 in the first half.</p>
<p>Changing sides to play again, China United rode the momentum and became even stronger. Longhai went on three one-on-one chances, but returned empty-handed. The Siam team launched a counterattack, seeming to have a turning point, but it was a fleeting moment and soon faded away. Longhai, Jinshun and others successively broke through and made contributions, retreating after achieving results, making it 4-0. The Siam team was at a loss and changed its strategy, shifting from attack to defense. However, despite their many tricks, Longhai and Jinshun both scored twice, making it half a dozen. The Siam team had zero, feeling both ashamed and annoyed. As expected, a surprise attack broke through the heavy encirclement, and before he could succeed, it became 6-1. One minute before the end of the game, the China United team, with a blitz-like offensive, stormed forward. Songwen tried his best to save it, but could not avoid the catastrophe. Baozheng took a shot from 30 yards out and went straight into the heart of the goal, making it 7-1. Before long, the legal time had arrived, and China United defeated the Siam United Team by a score of 7-1. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>China United</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang</p>

<h3>Eight Research Institutes, Eighteen Years of Work: Report on the Commemorative Meeting of the Ping Research Institute (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Li Shuhua</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly report on the work of the various research institutes of the Academy of Sciences over the past eighteen years:</p>
<p>Institute of Physics</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Jici, Qian Linzhao, and Chen Shangyi of the Institute of Physics have been engaged in research on optics and applied optics. During the War of Resistance, under the guidance of Mr. Yan Jici, the institute designed and manufactured more than 400 microscopes for use by specialized schools above the college level, hospitals, and factories in the rear; manufactured more than 100 sets of levels and theodolites for use by water conservancy agencies and public works bureaus; and manufactured more than 1,000 quartz oscillators for use by various radio stations, radio manufacturers, and Allied forces. It also designed and manufactured photographic heads for use in photography and radiography. Mr. Gu Gongxu engaged in geophysical research and cooperated with the Resources Committee to use physical methods to explore the reserves of important deposits such as coal, iron, steel, tin, lead, zinc, and sulfur in Yunnan and Guizhou. The institute sent personnel to measure the acceleration of gravity in various parts of China and has measured more than 230 locations.</p>
<p>Institute of Radium Studies</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Dazhang of the Institute of Radium Studies engaged in research on radium and nuclear physics before the War of Resistance, which was the beginning of nuclear physics research in China. Unfortunately, Mr. Zheng passed away during the War of Resistance. Mr. Lu Xueshan engaged in research on X-rays and used X-rays to study the structure of metals. Mr. Zhong Shengbiao researched crystal structures and the manufacture of ultraviolet lamps. The organizational regulations of the academy promulgated by the national government last year have changed the Institute of Radium Studies to the "Institute of Atomic Studies." However, the academy must strengthen its talent and equipment before considering the change.</p>
<p>Institute of Chemistry</p>
<p>The Institute of Chemistry focuses on research in organic chemistry. Mr. Zhou Faqi, Ji Yuqing, Wang Xu, Chen Guangxu, and Jiang Mingqian are all experts in organic chemistry. During the Kunming period, the institute paid special attention to practical problems and conducted a lot of research on application.</p>
<p>Institute of Materia Medica</p>
<p>The Institute of Materia Medica uses chemical methods to extract the effective qualities of Chinese medicine, researches their physical properties, chemical properties, pharmacological properties, and physiological properties, and then finds ways to utilize them. Mr. Zhao Chengji is mainly responsible for this work. On the other hand, Mr. Zhuang Changgong uses chemical methods to engage in synthetic work.</p>
<p>Institute of Physiology</p>
<p>The Institute of Physiology has researched the relationship between nutrition and Chinese medicine and physiology. Currently, Mr. Zhu Xi's work focuses on research on issues such as re-development and cells.</p>
<p>Institute of Zoology</p>
<p>The Institute of Zoology focuses on the investigation and research of aquatic animals and insects. Mr. Zhang Xi and Shen Jiarui presided over the research of aquatic animals, and Mr. Zhu Hongfu presided over the research of insects. Before the War of Resistance, the institute paid attention to the research of marine animals, regularly sending personnel to major locations along the coast of China, such as Yantai, Chenghaiwei, Jiaozhou Bay, Xiamen, Guangdong, and the Dutch East Indies, to collect specimens and study their living distribution status on the spot. During the War of Resistance, the institute paid attention to the research of freshwater animals. Dianchi Lake, Erhai Lake, and Yangzonghai Lake in Yunnan have all been investigated.</p>
<p>Institute of Botany</p>
<p>The Institute of Botany focuses on the research of plant classification and distribution. Mr. Liu Shen'e, Lin Rong, Wang Faqing, and Zhu Yancheng are all experts in plant classification. The area that the institute has sent personnel to investigate and collect over the years is very wide, reaching Changbai Mountain in the east; the Tianshan Kunlun Mountains, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas in the west; Yunnan and Guangdong in the south; Mongolia in the north; and passing through the Taihang Mountains, the Qinling Mountains, the Funiu Mountains, the Bashan Mountains, and the Huangshan Mountains. During the War of Resistance, the institute's investigation of the Northwest and Yunnan became more detailed. The institute currently has more than 150,000 plant specimens.</p>
<p>The Northwest China Institute of Botany particularly focuses on the research of forest machinery.</p>
<p>Institute of History and Philology</p>
<p>The work of the Institute of History and Philology is in two aspects: archeology and history. Mr. Xu Bingchang researches ancient history, Mr. Huang Wenbi sorts out the materials obtained by the Northwest Science Expedition, and Mr. Su Bingqi sorts out the materials unearthed by the institute at the Doujihe site in Bin County, Shaanxi. Mr. Feng Jiasheng researched the history of the Liao Dynasty and the evolution of the invention of gunpowder. Mr. Wang Jingru researched the history and writing of Xixia, ancient Xinjiang, and the society of the Sui and Tang Dynasties.</p>
<p>Statistically, in the past eighteen years, the colleagues of the academy have published about 500 research papers and investigation reports. The academy and various research institutes have published more than 50 kinds of publications and books, such as series, collections, special reports, reports, and compilations, most of which are contributions from the period of 1929 to 1937.</p>
<p>Memories of the Golden Age</p>
<p>Looking back at the period from 1929 to 1937, it was truly the golden age of Chinese scientific work. At that time, several small research centers in the country worked hard on research, creating a strong research atmosphere. After Chinese scientists published their scientific research work done in China, they often attracted the attention of foreign scientists and were often cited by foreign scientists. Therefore, Chinese scientists have added a lot of glory to the Chinese nation. I just said that the academy's colleagues made particularly many contributions during this period, which is something we can be proud of. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, colleagues still engaged in scientific work under various unsuitable conditions in the interior, and at the same time helped solve some practical problems. After the restoration, colleagues, despite financial difficulties and hardships in life, still buried themselves in the laboratory to seek the truth, which is all worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Colleagues Sacrificed Heroically</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to now, we have lost many colleagues. Mr. Lu Dingheng, Director of the Institute of Zoology; Mr. Zheng Dazhang, a full-time researcher at the Institute of Radium Studies; Mr. Zhong Guanguang, a researcher at the Institute of Botany; Mr. Shen Jianshi, a corresponding researcher; and Mr. Clipp, Mr. Langevand of France, Mr. An Ganxhen, the head of the Document Section, and Mr. Chen, the head of the Accounting Section, all died of illness around this period. Not long ago, Wang Hanchen, a collector from the Institute of Botany, fell into a mountain gully and died while collecting specimens in Diancang Mountain, Dali, which was particularly tragic. We are holding a memorial meeting today, so we are reminded of these gentlemen.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the equipment of our various research institutes was considered very good, but now it is relatively backward. Science has made great progress in the past ten years, especially the progress of nuclear physics research. The earth-shattering invention of the atomic bomb is the result of the development of nuclear physics. However, this type of research requires larger-scale equipment and a larger amount of funds. The academy has added very few books and instruments in the past ten years, and the original equipment suffered considerable losses during the War of Resistance. Therefore, our equipment is relatively backward. This is obviously the general situation of research institutions across the country. However, the academy's regular expenses are not enough to apply, the temporary expenses are far from enough, and the foreign exchange obtained is even less, so the academy feels particularly difficult. We should first add the equipment that has not been added in the past ten years and make up for the losses during the War of Resistance. Then continue to work hard, and our future achievements will definitely be better.</p>
<p>Future Research Work</p>
<p>I feel that in the future, my country's scientific research work should take on a part of the responsibility that it should bear for the progress of world science. Scientific research is the foundation of industrial construction. Scientific research is like a water source, and industrial application is like a river. Without a water source, there is no river. There is no doubt that we should make China an industrialized country, capable of mass production and mass manufacturing, so that we can survive independently in the world. However, this kind of industrial construction must be coordinated with scientific research work in order to be easily successful and have progress. (Conclusion)</p>

<h3>Suppressing the City's Rice Prices and Stabilizing People's Livelihood: Decision to Increase Rice Rationing by 100,000 Dan</h3>
<p>Minister Yu Comes to Shanghai to Negotiate the Shipment of Surplus Grain from Jiangxi and Hunan; Social Affairs Bureau Calls Rice Merchants for Talks to Stabilize Market Prices</p>
<p>The rise in rice prices intensified yesterday, soaring endlessly. Retail prices even reached 860,000 yuan per stone, approaching the 900,000 yuan mark, causing widespread panic and unease among the people of the city. Minister of Food Yu Feipeng came to Shanghai by train the night before yesterday for this reason and arrived here at 8:00 AM yesterday, immediately meeting with Mayor Wu to discuss strategies to suppress rice prices, and expedite the shipment of surplus grain from Jiangxi and Hunan. The mayor said yesterday that in order to suppress the rising rice prices, the decision was made to increase the rice ration for the poor and workers by 100,000 dan. The rice will be shipped from Jiangxi and Henan provinces to Shanghai, and the first batch of 50,000 dan will be shipped and rationed within days.</p>
<p>[Another report] Regarding the rice issue, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened the persons in charge of the city's rice markets again yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM for talks. Those present included rice merchants Zhang Xichao, Hu Wenan, Yin Fuxiang, Xu Mingren, Hu Hangang, Yang Wenci, as well as Ren Xianqun, standing committee member of the Civil Food Distribution Council, and Section Chief Ji Mingxuan, etc., totaling more than ten people.</p>
<p>Director Wu first reported that the recent surge in rice prices not only affected the livelihood of the common people, but also caused security problems. In order to maintain social stability, grain prices must be suppressed, and so on. Then, the grain merchant Hu Wenan reported that "Shanghai's population accounts for 1% of the country's total population. The city's main rice-producing areas in the past were Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, followed by Hubei and Hunan. Now it is autumn harvest time, and new rice has already entered the market. Grain prices should be stable, but instead, they are rising sharply. The reasons for the fluctuation are:</p>
<p>There are seven reasons for the increase</p>
<p>The general rise in prices affects rice prices in the producing areas. The central government's implementation of requisition, borrowing, and purchasing in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Hunan has greatly affected grain prices. The Communists are rushing to purchase grain in the producing areas. Wuhu, Anhui, which is the distribution center of grain in Anhui Province, has recently had so-called Chongsha gangs (Communist organizations) that are buying up grain regardless of price. The Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan producing areas have transportation difficulties, which hinders the transportation of food. The food business tax for this month will soon begin to be collected. Recently, the situation of grain sales in the city has revealed that the "porter gangs" are buying rice, and their behavior seems very suspicious. Grain merchants in the city have tens of thousands of bags of grain waiting to be shipped to Shanghai, but they cannot be delivered due to transportation difficulties. Finally, Director Wu hoped that the persons in charge of each market would assist the government in stabilizing market prices and persuade merchants not to "hold on," and to prioritize the food of the people.</p>
<h3>Chongqing City Commodity Production Statistics</h3>

<p>In addition, each cargo will be charged a transshipment fee of 100,000 yuan per ton, which is said to have been submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for record.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Decide to Take Strict Measures to Curb the Rising Prices in the City</h3>
<p>Around National Day, prices in the city skyrocketed, and rumors about financial crises were rampant, causing panic among the people. Yesterday (the 12th), a certain person in charge said that the competent authorities have decided to take strict measures. Starting from the 13th, in addition to the full deployment of economic police to step up surveillance of various markets, all relevant agencies will work together to curb the rising prices. Economic cases will be punished more severely in the future, and those who manufacture and spread rumors will be severely punished once discovered.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Sales Hot, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market started poorly due to the resale of returned goods from Beijing and Hankou, and prices were suppressed. Unexpectedly, by about 9:00 AM, demand from the industry was strong, and suppliers were reluctant to sell, and the market atmosphere rose again. Cigarettes with lower prices were particularly popular, and prices were firm.</p>
<p>The final ten Great Britain cigarettes rose 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, while Old Gold Hademens fell 100,000 yuan. Popular brands such as Great America, Gold Mouse, Bank, Double Axe, Cress, Million Gold, and Red Man saw prices rise. Other brands saw mixed results.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Remain Strong</h3>
<p>In the soap market, the price of raw material caustic soda rose to 34.5 million per barrel, and glycerin rose to about 5 million. Due to increased costs, factories were silent about dispatching goods, and the market was filled with strong buying interest and sellers remained firm, leading to a positive trend. As a result, in addition to Guben leveling out, Arrow Knife Huang Xiangmao soap continued to rise by 15,000 yuan, while other brands saw slight fluctuations. The price of both Beautiful and Phoenix kerosene rose by 50,000 yuan. The candle and kerosene markets were also strong.</p>
<h3>Affected by the "Tongtian" Permit, Hong Kong Internal Exchange Rate Falls</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong, 6th] Last week, the financial market was filled with a bearish atmosphere. Whether it was internal exchange rates, national currency, gold, or yellow paper, the market saw repeated lows. The bearish trend was even stronger for internal exchange rates and national currency.</p>
<p>In addition to the tightening and then loosening of money in the domestic market after the Mid-Autumn Festival, two factors caused the fall in the national currency exchange rate. Another factor was that domestic mobile funds began to flee abroad. The restoration of the use of the "Tongtian" permit and the sudden increase in the import of materials were the surface reasons for the increased need for foreign exchange. On the inside, a surge of domestic funds came to buy imported goods, because the difference between Hong Kong foreign goods, especially industrial raw materials and other luxury goods, and domestic market prices was generally more than one-fold profit. Even if the price of the "Tongtian" permit cost 70%, merchants were happy to operate.</p>
<h3>On Restricting Credit Cooperatives from Issuing Checks</h3>
<p>— Kang Yuanshou</p>
<p>The lower section of last month's newspaper reported: "To crack down on illegal negotiable instruments and safeguard the interests of banks and money houses, the Ministry of Finance has issued a circular to all banks and money houses, instructing them not to accept checks issued by credit cooperatives after a certain date. It has also requested the Ministry of Social Affairs to instruct all credit cooperatives to comply with the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law, prohibiting them from acting as the drawee of checks and ordering them to recall all checkbooks that have already been issued. At the same time, it has requested the Ministry of Judicial Administration to instruct courts at all levels not to regard checks with credit cooperatives as the drawee as legal negotiable instruments." An official from the Ministry of Finance also explained, stating, "Credit cooperatives are not financial institutions. According to the Negotiable Instruments Law, non-financial institutions are not allowed to issue checks. According to the Economic Emergency Measures, the establishment of new banks and money houses is restricted in eighteen areas, including Beijing and Shanghai," and so on. Presumably, this news is not fabricated. If the Ministry of Finance's circular is indeed issued, credit cooperatives nationwide will suffer a blow. In order to protect the development of the financial industry and promote the advancement of cooperative undertakings, I believe there are points that must be clarified in terms of both theory and legal system, in the hope of dispelling the above misunderstandings and ensuring that cooperative undertakings and the financial industry complement each other. This is the sole intention of this article.</p>
<p>"Cooperation" is a method of organization and management. In modern economic society, the cooperative organizational form can be said to be between the two methods of state-owned and privately-owned, or it can be said to be above the two organizations of public and private. The reasons for this can be the subject of a dedicated book, and there is no time to elaborate here. The scope of cooperative organization and management is extremely broad. At present, all kinds of public and private enterprises can be organized and managed in a cooperative manner, and we believe that this is the most rational way to organize and manage them. In modern countries, whether capitalist, socialist, or communist, they all allow the adoption of the cooperative system, which shows that the cooperative organizational method is not only applicable to the operation of various enterprises, but also universally applicable to various countries and societies. Our country has long adopted the cooperative system. The ruling Kuomintang regarded the cooperative movement as one of the seven major movements twenty years ago and vigorously promoted it. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings included agricultural cooperation, industrial cooperation, trading cooperation, banking cooperation (i.e., what is now known as "credit cooperatives"), and so on. Later, the cooperative policy of the Three Principles of the People was implemented. Over the past twenty years, various cooperative organizations have spread throughout the country. Now, we are awaiting the development of cooperative businesses to make their operations smooth and substantial, so that they can become the pillar of the new social economy and transform the old economic society. Now, any department of our government must follow the established central strategy to support the promotion of cooperative undertakings. Any individual in the country who has a desire to reform the current economic system will also make concerted efforts to develop cooperative businesses. Today, any cooperative in the country, as long as its business operations do not violate cooperative principles and cooperative laws and regulations, and there is no private gain or fraudulent activity, we have no reason to intentionally strike any blow to its business advancement. We also firmly believe that no organization or individual dares to intentionally strike any blow. We sincerely hope that those who unintentionally strike at cooperative undertakings will become aware of themselves and not fall into the old rut of the capitalist economic system, but instead turn around and become revolutionary pioneers in transforming the social economy.</p>
<p>Credit cooperation in cooperative undertakings is a cooperative undertaking that manages deposit and loan businesses and circulates finance among members. A credit cooperative that operates banking businesses for financial circulation, in other words, is a bank with special characteristics. This is the "banking cooperation" that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of, and it is also the people's bank that was commonly referred to in the past. Cooperative organizations were originally organizations for the economic weaker to become self-reliant. Credit cooperatives are also credit unions for the general economic weaker to help themselves, help each other, save themselves, and save others. This is the general public's own bank. Because they are economically weak, they feel the urgency of financial circulation even more, and there is even more need to organize credit cooperatives. This is enough to illustrate that credit cooperatives have a natural tendency to grow. Who has reason to say that the general public should not be self-reliant? Who can deny the credit cooperatives of the people's bank type organized by the general public? Who has reason to say that credit cooperatives are by no means engaged in businesses equivalent to banks? I don't think anyone can bear to strike a blow to a truly self-help movement of the people. As for the official from the Ministry of Finance saying that credit cooperatives are not financial institutions, it is obviously a kind of erroneous misinterpretation, which does not understand the actual content, tasks, and goals of credit cooperatives. As for the Economic Emergency Measures restricting the establishment of new banks and money houses in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, credit cooperatives were not mentioned. Moreover, the promulgation of the plan was intended to stabilize the economy and restrict general commercial banks and money houses from speculating and manipulating, while credit cooperatives are measures to stabilize the economy of the majority of the people. Today's credit cooperatives have no awareness or ability to speculate and manipulate, so they should not be included in the restrictions on establishment from the outset. So far, we have not heard of any credit cooperatives disrupting the market and undermining the economy, but instead, we have first seen the order to strike credit cooperatives.</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of public and private banks and money houses in the country has increased indiscriminately, credit has expanded, and business has developed, forming a trend of畸形 development, which has indeed created a torrent of financial capital, and echoes and colludes with commercial capital, land capital, and bureaucratic capital to seek personal gain, resulting in the decline of production, rising prices, economic disorder, and the crisis of social collapse. The formation of this phenomenon has many reasons, but it has little to do with the people's financial institutions that are currently budding, namely credit cooperatives. On the contrary, it is the banks and money houses that should be held more responsible. If we still use the reason of protecting the banks and money houses, and allow the existing banks and money houses to exclusively have the right to issue checks, and do not allow members of credit cooperatives to use the most convenient negotiable instruments for withdrawing deposits, forcing the general public to only deal with ordinary commercial banks and money houses, is this not unfair?</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on the actual business of India's industries today, and based on the facts, those who can have dealings with commercial banks and money houses are either the extremely wealthy, or the powerful merchants, or the high-ranking officials, or the influential people, or at least the general merchants who are more powerful in seeking profit. Banking business only interacts with the upper class of society, and the vast majority of the people can only look at it and not enter, especially the peasants and workers do not even know where the doors of the banks and money houses are open, how can they expect them to provide financing? This financial specialization is only a noble embellishment of society, and does not have a broad mass base. As a result, a dangerous phenomenon arises, that is, the so-called underground money houses emerge. The so-called underground money houses are just a general term for money houses that have not been registered and licensed by the government. The business they operate is also the business of financial circulation and money houses. However, upon examination, the business objects of underground money houses are purely small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the common people. The majority of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the common people suffer from the lack of institutions for financial circulation, and have no choice but to go to underground money houses to exchange what they have for what they lack. This shows that society first needs underground money houses, and then underground money houses are produced. We must diagnose the pathology of society before we can hope to have a remedy that treats the symptoms; otherwise, no matter how much we suppress and investigate underground money houses, underground money houses will continue to emerge. The Ministry of Finance may not be able to completely deny this fact. Now, credit cooperatives are allowed by national law, and are also registered by the local government, so they cannot be called underground money houses; however, the business objects of credit cooperatives are precisely the small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the general public that were previously grasped by underground money houses. However, these business objects themselves have become the masters of the credit cooperative, and the roles of owner and guest are integrated, which is very harmonious. Through the mediation of the cooperative, the problems of financial circulation and profit distribution among small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the general public can be reasonably resolved at the same time. Since small and medium-sized industrial and commercial operators and the common people have a way to obtain financing, the reason for the existence of underground money houses can be expected to disappear accordingly. All credit cooperatives then establish normal business relationships with banks and money houses. In this way, they have guided the general public into the doors of banks and money houses, and have established indirect dealings, which means that banks and money houses have a broad mass base, absorbing the idle funds of the broad masses and channeling them into legitimate uses. The top and bottom can converge, and the broad masses and banks and money houses both benefit. Such a complete and rich harvest almost entirely relies on credit cooperatives as a mediator. Therefore, today's credit cooperatives are nothing less than a bridge between the common people and the banks. The banks and money houses must deeply understand this reason, and express their sincere desire to support credit cooperatives. Now, many enlightened people in banks and money houses have indeed understood this great truth of co-existence and co-prosperity, so how can the administrative institutions managing financial business and the Ministry of Finance not understand this great truth? Therefore, I believe that this misunderstanding can be expected to dissipate immediately, and the Ministry of Finance will change its attitude and will also support credit cooperatives.</p>
<p>Now, let's explain from the legal system that credit cooperatives are financial institutions and are not subject to the restrictions of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and can issue checks. Now, Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Cooperative Law stipulates: "To promote financial circulation, to provide members with the necessary funds for production or manufacturing, and to accept deposits from members." This is the basic business of credit cooperatives. Article 5 of the same law stipulates: "Cooperatives that operate the businesses in Paragraph 4 of Article 3 may, with the approval of the competent authority, accept deposits from non-members." Article 2 of the current Banking Law stipulates: "The term 'banking business' in this law refers to the following: 1. Accepting various deposits,... 3. Handling various loans or discounting negotiable instruments...." Article 16 of the same law stipulates: "Anyone who regularly accepts currency or funds, regardless of whether the method of acceptance is by giving checks or deposit books or receipts or loan certificates or promissory notes or other similar proof documents, shall be regarded as banking business." Article 123 of the current Negotiable Instruments Law stipulates: "The drawee of a check shall be a bank or money house...." Upon reviewing the current laws listed, no matter how they are interpreted in combination, credit cooperatives are all financial institutions, or at least should be in the category of "regarded as banking business." Since they are financial institutions, they can legally issue checks. Moreover, a check is a type of contractual negotiable instrument. The contractual negotiable instrument act between the credit cooperative and the depositor only needs to be approved by the parties involved to take effect, and the law does not prohibit it. The Cooperative Law, the Banking Law, and the Negotiable Instruments Law are all laws promulgated by the National Government, and the responsibility for their interpretation does not belong to the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, the competent cooperative authority in the central government is the Ministry of Social Affairs. Any changes to national cooperative affairs must be discussed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Social Affairs before being jointly implemented, so that it is appropriate. If the Ministry of Finance is concerned about preventing credit cooperatives from滥用 issuing checks, it should also promptly consult with the Ministry of Social Affairs to properly establish management measures. A unilateral circular cannot be convincing. Moreover, whether the use of checks is beneficial or not, and whether there are abuses, is a common problem for all check issuers, and is by no means a unique problem for credit cooperatives. Could it be that the Ministry of Finance can issue a circular ordering all banks and money houses to stop issuing checks altogether because a certain bank or money house's checks have some problems?</p>
<p>In summary, today, the Chinese government should not passively restrict or strike at the affairs of credit cooperatives, but should actively guide them to the right path. It is best for the Ministries of Social Affairs and Finance to jointly discuss strict management measures to prevent them from being exploited by criminals. The operators of current credit cooperatives should also be aware of the need to be vigilant and strive to complete their tasks.</p>

<h3>Mary Ma</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Mary Ma, is Ma Mary; calling Miss Ma's honorable name is really awkward, if you affectionately call her Mary directly, then it's no different from Liu Mary or Zhu Mary, because there are too many young ladies who use Mary as their beautiful name nowadays. Of course, she also has a foreign name, Mary Ma, but her group of friends, like-minded people, all feel that our inherent culture has a need to be preserved, therefore, a compromise solution arose, and everyone calls her Mary Ma.</p>
<p>However, initially we called her Ma Mary, later, how did it evolve into "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application" Mary Ma? When did that bit of "inspiration" begin? It's already hard to remember clearly, so that historic day cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Mary Ma is in the prime of her beauty. —— Every year on April 10th (of course, the Western calendar), in the spring with fragrant flowers and singing birds, we are invited to attend her birthday party. In her exquisite and beautiful small living room, I remember I have had this honor for five years. Her walnut cake, delicious apple pudding, all kinds of clever games, the smile like a rose, the voice like singing... I remember them all clearly, what I can't figure out is her age. The year before last, she told me she was two years older than her younger sister, but this year, Eileen Ma said she was four years younger than her older sister. Anna Belle Lee said she was probably twenty-six, and Louise Zhao said she was only twenty-three. In short, although everyone knows her birthday is April 10th, her age is a mystery, which is another thing that cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Mary Ma is very beautiful. Our history books mention four beauties who could make fish sink, geese fall, the moon hide, and flowers feel ashamed, but Mary Ma does not look like a Chinese person. She said: "George Chen said I look like Olivia De Havilland, I don't know if it's true?" Of course, we dutifully nodded our heads vigorously, chiming in and saying she did, calling out "Olivia De Havilland" a few more times after Mary Ma. During the enemy-occupied period, Western films were banned, so several Japanese stars were popular for a while, among whom the most beautiful was Mieko Takamine. Once, Mary Ma said to me: "Someone said I look like her." I forgot to ask her if it was George Chen. A middle school student knows that if A=B, and B=C, then C=A must also be true, but I can't see any similarities between Mieko Takamine and Olivia De Havilland.</p>
<p>But, whether she's twenty-three or twenty-six, Mary Ma is still young. Whether she's Mieko Takamine or Olivia De Havilland, Mary Ma is always beautiful. So it is said: Mary Ma is in the prime of her youthful beauty, no one can deny this statement.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Mary Ma is from Shanghai. This point cannot be verified either, but there are words to prove it, so it shouldn't be wrong.</p>
<p>We don't know much about her family situation: we only know that her father wears Western suits, and they are very sharp suits, her mother's hair is styled in a hair salon on a monthly basis, they don't call their parents "Aba" or "Muma", but "Daddy" and "Mommy", her eldest brother has many foreign friends, her second brother got married at the International Hotel, the officiant and introducer were all well-known celebrities, I forgot the names of the celebrities, but anyway, they were celebrities, Eileen's piano playing is outstanding, her younger brother is "kissed up to" by teachers at school... All of this was personally told by Mary Ma. It shouldn't be wrong.</p>
<p>In her exquisite small living room, there are fresh flowers in vases, the calendar is torn off every day; she never reads tabloids, and it is said that she doesn't read Chinese newspapers much, she always reads foreign newspapers; she always listens to Western music on the radio, she doesn't even like popular Chinese songs, let alone storytelling and Shaoxing opera. She goes to church to listen to sermons every Sunday, although they are not a Christian family, they always remember to say a "Hallelujah" before meals (Mary Ma's nanny and elder sister will also say it), every time the telephone rings, when she picks up the receiver, she never says "Wei". I have witnessed all of this with my own eyes, so of course it can't be wrong.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>The first time I saw her was still at school. After the winter vacation ended and school started, on the day of registration, our group had just changed from freshmen to old students, and we were quite smug, so we pointed and scrutinized those students who had just been admitted! Just like others used to do to us.</p>
<p>In that dim corridor, everyone's eyes lit up, it turned out a beauty was walking by. In the cold winter weather, she wore the hairstyle of the dancer named Zaza in "Dance Palace Wind and Moon", a foreign red robe, a white coat, and her high heels made a clicking sound on the ground. She walked extremely fast, we even forgot to pay attention to her face, we only felt the fragrance of powder, a kind of dignified and luxurious demeanor, sacred and inviolable. When we remembered we should take a closer look, she had already walked gracefully into the director's office.</p>
<p>After a while, two senior male students walked out of the director's office, they were talking, their faces showing extremely funny smiles.</p>
<p>"Hey, I know who she is, my sister's classmate's brother's friend's lover from a year ago..."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, what's her name?"</p>
<p>"Her name is Ma—" He scratched his head, "Ma" wouldn't come out.</p>
<p>"Her name is Ma?"</p>
<p>"Ah, her name is Ma Mary."</p>
<p>"Hmm, the name fits the person, she should be Ma Mary, but someone like that should study sociology, or English literature, why is she studying political science?"</p>
<p>"Why can't she? Your thinking is so strange? There's no such stipulation on the enrollment rate."</p>
<p>"Someone like her..."</p>
<p>"Women are natural politicians, have you forgotten? Especially a woman like Ma Mary, she is an excellent politician."</p>
<p>"Are you insulting politicians? Or are you satirizing Ma Mary?"</p>
<p>"Neither, but Ma Mary, she—"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Wang," Mary Ma called out in surprise, coming out of the director's office, hurrying forward to shake hands, with a face full of smiles, friendly, "like meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land": "I came looking for you as soon as I arrived, and your Miss Jiang; how is your younger sister? I haven't seen her in a long time, I really miss her..."</p>
<p>That Mr. Wang turned his head halfway, also with a face full of smiles, but a bit awkward, unnatural.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>As for how I became familiar with her, it was a year after that. In order to study "Civil Law" together, I had the good fortune to sit next to Mary Ma. Our civil law professor was an old man, often in poor health and absent from class, and often busy in court and unable to come, so there were a few hours when I could avoid listening to the boring and rigid general and specific provisions of civil law, and chat with Mary Ma. From her, I learned many things I didn't know before, as well as knowledge and skills not in books, for example: what kind of face should have what kind of hairstyle, nylon stockings worn inside out are better than worn right side out if the fabric is good, which brand of leather shoes is good, which photo studio takes the best photos, the foreign female ticket taker at the Cathay Theatre is not as "interesting" as the one at the Grand Theatre, when making a cake how much flour should be added to how much water, an old men's woolen coat can be made into a pair of shoe covers for winter, don't chew gum while dancing... In the blink of an eye a year passed, my "Civil Law" earned four credits, and I also absorbed much "knowledge outside of the textbook", although I am too unfilial to be able to apply what I learned, but when I think about how I am not as ignorant as before, I remember the source of the water when drinking it, and I sincerely thank Mary Ma.</p>
<p>What I should especially be grateful for is that she taught me almost all of these things unconditionally. Of course, there was an exchange of mutual benefit at first, she said to me: "Your Mandarin pronunciation is pleasant, starting tomorrow, will you be my Mandarin teacher?"</p>
<p>I specifically bought a copy of Cao Yu's "Under a Skylight", so it would be interesting to read, but in less than three days, Mary Ma frowned: "It's difficult to read, my tongue can't roll properly." So I changed to "Tragedy on the Lake", because there were no northern dialects, Mary Ma said again, "There are ghosts inside, I'm scared, I'll have nightmares at night, I'm so afraid." I was amazed by these opinions of hers, so Mary Ma is so superficial? However, I am only her Mandarin teacher, not a Chinese teacher, what business is it of mine to meddle in these matters?</p>
<p>However, in the end, not even one book was finished, and our "Mandarin class" died a natural death, because she was so "short of breath", why should I be "self-indulgent"?</p>
<p>Mary Ma's attitude toward everything foreign is not just blind faith, it's simply passionate love, crazy passionate love. "The moon is better when it's foreign," of course, is a matter of course, in fact, even dust and ants are seen by Mary Ma as better if they are imported than domestic. Chinese film companies can't make good films, Chinese tailors can only make the same old cheongsams, the patterns of Chinese fabrics are mostly countrified, Chinese children always drag their snotty noses, Chinese old ladies hold prayer beads instead of Bibles and crucifixes, Chinese lovers can't even walk properly on the street, there are rarely one or two pairs as smart as foreigners, either the woman is coy, or the man is extremely fierce; ... In short, everything Chinese is bad, except for Mary Ma.</p>
<p>I heard that returned students are more Westernized than foreigners, but Mary Ma is even more Westernized than returned students; she eats sandwiches, she doesn't even look at fried dough sticks, coffee and Longjing tea both have a bit of bitterness, but the former is bitter with flavor, the latter is bitter for no reason; she never watches Chinese movies, she doesn't even watch sophisticated plays, when there are no Western films, she listens to concerts if she can't see operas, she watches even if she doesn't understand, she listens next time even if she doesn't understand; she is a loyal customer of Coty and Max Factors, if anyone uses Butterfly cream, Mary Ma's pretty face immediately puts on a cute and annoying expression; "Eww!" She usually likes to chew gum and chocolate, probably learned from American girls, the style of her coat, even foreign shops along Jing'an Temple Road rarely have it, because Mary Ma is ahead of her time, her clothes are a "crystallization" of the heroines in foreign films and the female models in foreign magazines, adopting the essence of both and custom-made.</p>
<p>In addition, Mary Ma also has a pet dog, the nationality of that dog is unknown, but his ancestral home is definitely not China, I can say with certainty, the dog's beautiful name is Sisi, according to Chinese rankings, Sisi should be related to Mary, but the East wind never blows to the West, then this misunderstanding will naturally not happen.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>If I were writing a biography for Mary, there are three things that should not be left out.</p>
<p>It seems like the year we were juniors, when school had just started, when chatting, everyone talked about the courses they were taking this semester, one classmate said: "It's really hard to study this year, all the books are in the original language."</p>
<p>Mary Ma had a strange look on her face: "All in the original language? Then how can "Chinese Philosophy History"—"</p>
<p>That pretentious one said: "Indeed, "Chinese" Philosophy History is also in the "original language"."</p>
<p>We were all speechless. —— This is the first thing.</p>
<p>There is another thing that I cannot forget, at that time we had already graduated, one weekend afternoon, I accompanied Mary Ma to meet two male classmates in front of the American Church on Avenue Petain, to discuss some matters about the class reunion, Mary Ma had arranged to meet them at four o'clock, we arrived there at three fifty-five, unexpectedly those two male classmates were late, so Mary Ma was very unhappy, and pulled me to walk towards Avenue Grouchy, turning onto Route Tenant. She grumbled angrily: "How can those boys be so unreasonable? I agreed to meet at four o'clock, but they made people wait." She leisurely strolled, chatting, for half an hour, suddenly it started raining, then she called a rickshaw to the church. From afar she saw the two latecomers standing at the door, and immediately instructed me: "Look at those two people, I really want to make them suffer a bit; when we see them in a little while, don't say we've been here before." Of course, I respectfully obeyed her orders. The rickshaw stopped in front of the church, Mary Ma showed an expression adept at socializing, jumped out of the car, and said: "I'm so sorry, we had a little matter." Those two quickly said, "It's okay, just a little bit." I looked at my watch, it was quarter to five, their clothes were wet from the rain, we spent the rickshaw fare twice.</p>
<p>Once, Mary Ma invited us for "afternoon tea", and unexpectedly there was a Chinese snack, I happily exclaimed: "Mary Ma, this is really great, silver thread rolls are my favorite."</p>
<p>Mary Ma quickly brought the plate of silver thread rolls to me: "Mommy just hired a new cook, he used to be at Liang Garden."</p>
<p>I said, "That's right, Liang Garden, no wonder it's made so well, that's a Henan restaurant."</p>
<p>Mary Ma shook her head: "What Henan Hunan, I can't remember them clearly either, Chinese place names are always like that, look at foreign place names, they are so much easier to read."</p>
<p>I felt that the easiest thing to do was to just eat the silver thread rolls, and not bother her with chattering and causing trouble, so I didn't open my mouth. —— This is the third thing.</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>Recently, I haven't seen Mary Ma in a long time, I heard that she will soon marry Alexander Ding, who just returned from the United States. I haven't seen Alexander Ding, I only heard that he is not from Shanghai, I hope he is not from Henan, Hunan, Hebei, or Hubei, otherwise, since Mary Ma can't remember Chinese place names clearly, wouldn't Alexander Ding's hometown be as unverifiable as Sisi's ancestral home?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Rivers and Mountains, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This honest man continued his analysis:</p>
<p>"Your mission number, is probably a 'seven'.........right? Or it's an agreed-upon code, - outside the door is a 'seven', and this room of yours also has a 'seven' - although it's number twenty-seven, maybe it's because of that number seven, seventeen, thirty-seven are already inhabited...... this is just my wild guess; maybe it's just a coincidence...... but......</p>
<p>"But, you probably don't fully understand the serious situation in Tianjin these days; besides this vicious dog of mine, who is just dabbling in it, the Japanese military, secret service, constabulary, police, mobilized thousands of people, to hunt down 'anti-Japanese' elements everywhere. That kind of thing, like the one that little comrade went to inquire about, happens at least two or three, four or five times a day; it's not uncommon. But you're still so brazen, setting up a code on the wall!...... You may have some special certainty, not taking the Japanese secret agents seriously, but I'm sweating for you......</p>
<p>"Regarding those few who just passed by the door, I also recognize them a bit. I know their organization, their work. But I have to say one honest word: they are really some 'newborn calves', fearless...... just now I chased after them, to give them a warning, but they bounced back, making me unable to step down; it really makes people feel a bit amused and annoyed; it fits what the literati say, 'unable to cry or laugh'.........'bittersweet'!........."</p>
<p>This "it" ranted on and on, talking non-stop, and throughout it all, he didn't hear Yaoqun open his mouth; not even "uh," "ah," "yell," "ah," "eh," these exclamatory symbols, were she willing to let out easily; as for affirmative terms like "yes," "no"; "correct," "incorrect," of course, she was even less willing to utter them. This inevitably seemed a bit "clumsy," or at least a bit unsociable or weakeningly calm, wasn't it? But isn't this kind of calmness also a kind of expression? This expressionless expression, from the other party, this "it's" point of view, could at least allow him to determine one, two, or three points about Yaoqun's foundation, couldn't it?</p>
<p>That's right, Yaoqun was always listening, always maintaining a state of tranquility. Between her eyebrows, besides a state of tranquility, only the slight furrowing of her brow revealed a trace of curiosity. Her countenance was originally a type of beauty, the contours of her face were naturally like they had been sculpted by a master. Eyes, eyebrows, mouth, nose, ears, cheeks, forehead, chin, all just met the conditions, all just in the right place. Especially the part of her lips, at this moment, under the condition of tranquility, although they were pursed, they were pursed very naturally, the corners of her mouth were slightly upturned, expressing the word "sweet", a sweetness that was extremely adorable.</p>
<h3>Touring Linggu Temple and Jiming Temple in the Rain in the Capital with Senior Wang Yimei</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The slanting wind turned to autumn overnight, touring Bai Xia in the rain; clouds and mists fill the valley, who can discern the peaks of Zijin?</p>
<p>Ancient trees line the road in thousands, birds sing in secluded leisure; the mountain peaks have already entered Mi Fu's brush, a natural splashed ink painting.</p>
<p>Today's mountain tour is not extravagant, clothes and shoes soaked and mottled; climbing the building still wants to exhaust a thousand miles, but the misty air obscures the nearby peaks.</p>
<p>Sparse branches, ancient temple, old flower king, simple and leisurely, the fragrance of generations; how envious of the recluse Lin Bu of Gushan, the beautiful story of plum and crane leaves a fragrant sentence. (Plum blossoms of Linggu Temple from the Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>Don't blame the lack of opportunity for a boat ride, leaning on a cane to climb the Jiuxiao Tower; the mountain light in the rain floats green above the city, the lotus leaves slant in the wind, the green covers the whole state.</p>
<p>Hearing the rooster crow in the autumn wind and autumn rain, a unique feeling arises from touching the scenery; across the bank, the willow embankment turns white waves, the lake and mountains swallow and spit out the ancient capital.</p>
<p>Even though not yet entered the water and cloud homeland, ten miles of misty waves spread a green canopy; the luxury of the Six Dynasties leaves regretful events, the Rouge Well water still has fragrance.</p>
<p>The drizzling rain evokes nostalgia, the gilded South Dynasty is infinitely sad; several rounds of temple bells ring more urgently in the cold, on the way home, I compose another travel poem.</p>
<h3>Wen Tianxiang (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Bai Shao</p>
<h3>Is Mutation a Chemical Change?</h3>
<p>— Hao Tianhe</p>
<p>In genetics, mutation is assumed to occur due to a chemical change. This change must occur in many gene units on the chromosome, or at least in one gene unit. This mutated gene is often as stable as a normal gene. Stability means it can produce the same mutated gene as itself and start a new genetic system. It is believed that without mutation, life would never evolve beyond its original starting point. However, the mechanical method of important steps is still unknown. Since H. J. Muller used artificial methods such as X-rays to induce mutations, a new avenue has been opened for the mutation problem, and many new facts about this problem have slowly begun to emerge. X-rays can break chromosomes, and when many fragments split down and reconnect, a change can occur, much like natural mutation. As for the correlation between the quality of radiation and the form and rate of mutation, it has also been discovered, and the number of ionizations required, as well as the size of the sensitive gene volume, can be estimated. However, the actual state of gene mutation and chromosome breakage is still as mysterious as before.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that X-rays are destructive to chromosomes, and their destructive power is considerable. If a gentler method is used to induce mutations, the steps involved may be seen more clearly. Since the discovery that ultraviolet rays can also induce mutations, there has been some progress in this area. The effective wavelengths for nucleic acids and certain protein components, although sometimes helpful in analyzing the steps of mutation, have absorption limits. Researchers in radiation genetics have pointed out that the first step in mutation is the absorption of a quantum of energy by a certain component molecule of the chromosome. However, relying solely on wavelength has not revealed very reliable effects. The differences between the effects of ultraviolet rays and shorter rays such as X-rays and gamma rays (r-ray) are not yet clear, but it may be helpful in analyzing the steps of mutation.</p>
<p>Chemical drugs that can cause mutations should be particularly effective as tools for exploring mutations. As we assume, mutation is due to a chemical change, so if we have sufficient knowledge of the chemical drug, we can not only understand the effect of the chemical drug itself, but also understand the nature of the gene. Moreover, during the trial process, we can hope to find some chemical mutagens that may have special effects on certain individual genes. If such a substance is discovered, it will not only arouse strong theoretical interest, but also open up a long-awaited path to produce mutations. In other words, mutation can be controlled by human power.</p>
<p>The work of exploring chemical mutagens has been going on for more than 20 years. For the purpose of exploration, scientists have selected a wide range of substances: such as iodine, ammonia, metal compounds, and various carcinogens [Note 1]. These are just a few of the many substances being tested. However, the results obtained are all clearly negative, that is, no significant positive results have been obtained since the experiment began in 1940. This shows that a chemical mutagen must have special properties. It must select specific substances in the gene to act on, and at the same time, it cannot destroy the cell itself containing that substance. Therefore, before finding a suitable and effective substance, we have to use many items for testing, and we are still demanding it. From the records of various studies, they are all indicating various physiological conditions, such as age, gender, hunger, and the type of factor itself, on the impact of mutation. If the chemical conditions that occur in the organism itself can affect the steps of mutation, then it is possible to obtain the same result after adding chemical substances from the outside.</p>
<p>Mustard gas can inhibit cell division. Based on this fact, some people use it for this type of experiment. However, mustard gas, like X-rays, will burn cells and is not easy to heal. Even if it recovers, it still has a tendency to rupture. In addition, it was found that the epidermal tissue of ovariectomized mice, after being immersed in a dilute solution of mustard gas, the lined division of cells will stop, and the stop of division will continue for several weeks. Originally, the cells in that tissue could maintain normal division if stimulated by estrogen. Everyone knows that after X-ray radiation, it can cause chromosomes to break and recombine, and at the same time inhibit the ability of cells to reproduce. The reason is half due to the mechanical disturbance of lined division and half due to cell death. Although that cell has assembled the fragments of chromosomes into new chromosomes and distributed them into daughter cells, the daughter cells did not receive a complete and normal set of chromosomes, resulting in death. Therefore, mustard gas, like X-rays, may also have a direct effect on chromosomes and prevent cell division.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1940, scientists began to test whether mustard gas could produce gene mutations and chromosome reorganization. The materials they used were fruit flies. First, the fruit flies were placed in a closed room filled with mustard gas, and then placed in a container, and the air and mustard gas were extracted from it. The initial results seemed to show signs of success. Both males and females became infertile, and the degree of damage depended on the amount of medicine used. The reason for the elimination of their reproductive power can be found in two unrelated reasons. The phenomenon of sterility caused by X-rays will also have these two reasons: first, the production of gametes is prevented, so there are no eggs or sperm available for use. Second, even if the egg is fertilized and becomes a zygote, the mortality rate of the zygote is quite high. A more important result is that the mortality rate of the eggs produced after normal female fruit flies are mated with male fruit flies that have been treated with mustard gas is also very high. The most appropriate explanation is probably that after the male fruit flies have been treated, their sperm have not lost their activity, but mustard gas, like X-rays, can also cause the chromosomes of the sperm to break and reorganize.</p>
<p>In order to prove that mustard gas has an effect on chromosomes, genetic methods should be used to explore mutations. Male fruit flies can be mated with virgin female fruit flies, and then check whether mutations occur in their second generation. Early mutation research work, as well as recent genetic research work, have not used fruit flies to do experiments thoroughly, and have encountered difficulties in eliminating most of the artificial errors, because a trained researcher can point out several abnormalities, but this extraordinary nature is often overlooked by people with insufficient experience and inaccurate observation. In the study of fruit fly genetics, this main difficulty has been removed by the method designed by Muller. Without that method, quantitative analysis of the heredity of radiant energy would be impossible. The main point of that method is to only explore lethal mutation (Lethal mutation). This mutation can prevent the development of the individual, so to see whether there is a lethal mutation, just check the offspring of the entire group of fruit flies, whether it exists or not, it is very easy to distinguish. This method can minimize personal errors, and at the same time, can check a large number of samples without too much effort. The famous CLB test method is particularly useful for large-scale tests. That method is used to test sex-linked lethal genes. This lethal gene is located on the sex chromosome. Males have only one, while females have two. A sex-linked lethal gene on the male sex chromosome can prevent the development of males, and this gene usually does not seriously hinder the development of females. In the CLB test, each treated or controlled sex chromosome will eventually appear in the second generation of the entire group of fruit flies. If a lethal gene occurs on the sex chromosome, the entire group of fruit flies must all be female. Of course, this fact can be quickly observed even by untrained people.</p>
<p>The first CLB test done with mustard gas started in April 1941. The results were very impressive and unexpected. The natural occurrence rate of sex-linked lethal genes in animals raised in the laboratory is very low, only reaching 1%. However, after treatment with mustard gas, the lethal genes on the sex chromosomes reached 90 out of 1,300, which means that the mutation rate accounts for more than 7%. If mustard gas was not used, only three sex-linked lethal genes were found on the same number of chromosomes, which means that the mutation rate under normal circumstances only accounts for 0.2%. The same results have been obtained before with X-rays or other high radiant energy. Continued experiments fully prove this fact, even exceeding the first result. The lethal gene rate actually reached 24%. A higher percentage is probably unlikely to occur, because the higher the mutation rate, the more severe the extinction rate also becomes.

<h3>Wonderful Pollen</h3>
<p>— Sun Jia Ling</p>
<p>Various kinds of pollen are flying in the air around us. Although they cannot be seen with the naked eye, they all contain organic life. These male plants are riding on the wind, pursuing their coming happiness! Whether this fluttering is only a foot away, or hundreds of miles away, they have the same goal—to reach the female flower of the same species and match up.</p>
<p>If there were no pollen, plants would no longer bear fruit, flowers and plants would wither, and we would not be able to eat various fruits.</p>
<p>Although it contains unlimited vitality, these pollens are as fragile as a candle in the wind. Thirst and starvation are common occurrences. Even a drop of dew is enough to kill it, because pollen grains expand and rupture when they encounter water, and the sperm cells are directly exposed to ultraviolet rays, and they immediately lose their lives. A grain of corn pollen can survive for up to 36 hours in a natural environment. Only a very small number of pine pollen can survive for several months.</p>
<p>When carefully observed under a microscope, various pollens have the cleanliness of snowflakes, the form of stalactites, and surprising magnificence. These delicate fine grains, even the largest pumpkin pollen, are only one-hundredth of an inch thick, while the pollen of the forget-me-not grass growing on the Alps is one hundred times smaller!</p>
<p>There are no pine forests on the large island of Greenland in the isolated Arctic Ocean, but biologists have found pine pollen there (pollen of pine trees). Unexpectedly, the pine tree closest to Greenland is actually 400 miles away in Labrador. This light pine pollen can travel across the ocean and fly 400 miles away!</p>
<h3>New Elements</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Before discussing new elements, let us briefly describe the structure of the atom. At the beginning of the 19th century, Dalton proved by experimental methods that matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.</p>
<p>Later, after many years and the research of many scientists, it was found that atoms are composed of complex particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons. Electrons are tiny particles with a negative charge. The mass is 9.035×10-28 grams. The outer shell of each elemental atom is surrounded by different numbers of electrons. Protons are tiny particles with a positive charge equal to the electric charge of electrons, and the mass is 2,000 times that of electrons. Neutrons are neutral particles formed by the tight combination of electrons and protons, and the mass is the same as that of protons. The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. The charge it carries depends on the protons, and the mass is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons, which is the mass of the atom.</p>
<p>We know that atoms can be divided into two categories: radioactive atoms and stable atoms. Radioactive atoms can emit LB and r rays. The L particle is the atomic nucleus of the gas atom, which is organized by two protons and neutrons. The other is an electron similar to the speed of light. B radiation is a product of the neutron turning into a proton. r radiation is a wave radiation or a high-energy photon.</p>
<p>At present, the production of new elements is all achieved by bombarding the atomic nucleus with L particles or neutrons. The atomic bombardment technology was first used by Rutherford to use L particles emitted by radioactive substances to bombard the atomic nucleus and emit protons. From this, it can be seen that atoms can be artificially transformed into another type of atom.</p>
<p>The element uranium belongs to a type of radioactive element. There is an isotope with an atomic weight of 238. If neutrons are injected into the nucleus of uranium 238, it will transform into Neptunium, with an atomic number of 93. It is sexually active, so its lifespan is very short. Neptunium becomes Plutonium through B-ray transformation, with an atomic number of 94. It was discovered in 1941 that it has the same fission characteristics as Uranium and almost the same radioactivity. It can be converted into uranium 235 and emit L particles.</p>
<p>The transformation of uranium into a new element is due to the injection of neutrons into the atomic nucleus. The quality of the uranium nucleus increases and becomes unstable, and a B ray is emitted. This B particle carries a negative charge and is an electron emitted when a neutron in the atomic nucleus turns into a proton. Therefore, the nucleus has one more positive charge of proton, which makes its atomic number change from 92 to 93 and 95 and so on.</p>
<p>However, when L particles are used to bombard the nucleus of uranium, many new elements are produced, such as Americium with atomic number 95, translated as 镅; Curium with 96, translated as 锔 in memory of Curie; and an element 97 (Berkalium), translated as 锫. In the future, as atomic physical chemistry progresses, the discovery of new elements will increase even more.</p>
<h3>Man-Controlled Missiles</h3>
<p>— Chen Fu</p>
<p>Sensitive soldiers often have to imagine what the Third World War would be like. U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Keith McCutcheon published an article in the June-July issue of the Naval Magazine about man-controlled missiles. If the Third World War lasts for a considerable period of time, this weapon may become a major factor in victory or defeat.</p>
<p>McCutcheon said that when World War I was about to end, there was often at least one new weapon invented. However, it often succeeded too late to exert its power. Airplanes were only tested in World War I, and became the main weapon in World War II. Among the new weapons in World War II, the most developed were the German V-1 and V-2 rockets. (In the eyes of the military, the atomic bomb is not a perfect weapon but a high explosive. Now it has to be transported to the target by plane, and in the future it may be transported by man-controlled missiles).</p>
<p>Although rockets destroyed many buildings in this war, they did not win because of them. Mr. Mai said that rockets are still imperfect weapons because they have several major shortcomings, that is, they cannot be guided by humans and cannot be controlled by humans after landing. Strictly speaking, a rocket is not a man-controlled weapon, at most it is just a long-range artillery shell.</p>
<p>Scientists in every powerful country are now using all their minds to find ways to eliminate these shortcomings. Mr. Mai said that they are studying physical laws and finding a suitable one to guide rockets. Television, heat, light, and sound have all been considered for application. Magnetism, electricity, and gravity have also been considered. Which country solves this problem first will have the advantage.</p>
<p>Mr. Mai also said that power is not a problem. Before atomic energy power can be applied, various reaction engines can be used to propel rockets. The most common reaction engine is the Turboict Engine. The front of this jet engine is an air compressor. Air is drawn into the front, mixed with fuel and burned, and becomes a high-pressure mixed gas. It is ejected from the tail at a rate of one thousand miles per hour, and its reaction force causes the rocket to move forward. When the gas is set to rush out at the tail, it makes the turbine rotate, which makes the compressor continue to work.</p>
<p>A relatively simple and developing rocket is the flying barrel rocket, which has no moving mechanism. Whether it is a turbojet or a flying barrel, the flame cannot reach above the high-altitude air. Because missiles flying at high altitudes must have their own rocket motors and carry oxygen like V-2.</p>
<p>Controlled missiles equipped with jet engines or rocket motor engines (or a combination of the two) will appear in the Third World War and will be able to have speeds of thousands of miles per hour. Engineers no longer doubt this. But the problem is how to guide and control. Mr. Mai put forward several possible methods for this.</p>
<p>The simplest missiles are not controlled at all, just like all V-type weapons, they can be set in advance like an alarm clock for targets in the flight path. Man-controlled missiles are directed by radio waves from the ground, ship, or airplane. Along the way, it can detect whether it is following the designated route. When approaching the target, the speed is greater. If the target emits waves such as sound, light, and heat, then the missile can follow the descent without fail.</p>
<p>At present, there are not many man-controlled missiles that have passed the design stage (such as the Navy's "Bat" and "Flying Island"). But Mr. Mai has predicted that this type of missile can be used in the next war after considerable improvement. Some missiles have great flight power. If they are equipped with atomic bombs, any city of the enemy will be destroyed. Because this bombing does not need to be absolutely accurate. If you want to destroy a certain enemy bomber, you don't need to use an atomic bomb, just equip it with ordinary bombs. After the launching method of missiles is improved in the future, we can see a huge submarine approaching the enemy's coast with missiles rising up, like islands coming out of a knot.</p>
<p>Mr. Mai believes that offense is the best defense, but he knows that the United States has never learned to steal the Pearl Harbor from Japan, so he said that the United States must have a missile that can take off in a very short period of time to resist enemy missiles.</p>
<p>Mr. Mai finally said that the camp newspaper needs the most improvement, because the speed of missiles can be as far as three thousand miles per hour, and it approaches fifty miles every minute. Therefore, the air defense equipment must be very sensitive and cannot easily let go of every minute of the twenty-four hours.</p>

<h3>Provisional Measures for Collecting "Preferential Fees" for Volunteer Soldiers' Settlement Expenses (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Since the city began to recruit volunteer soldiers, the Shanghai Municipal Government has formulated two "Provisional Measures for Collecting Preferential Fees for the Slow Recruitment of Strong Young Men" and "Provisional Measures for Collecting Preferential Fees for Households Without Strong Young Men Enlisted in the Army" regarding the fundraising for volunteer soldiers' settlement expenses. Both have been announced and implemented. However, recently this column has received repeated letters from readers asking whether the amount collected by each guarantee is legal. It is impossible to handle them one by one. Therefore, the above two measures are disclosed in summary as a reply.</p>
<p>(A) The "preferential fee" payable for slowing the recruitment of strong young men 1. The preferential fee paid for slowing the recruitment of strong young men is divided into three types: A, B, and C: Type A is 300,000 yuan, Type B is 150,000 yuan, and Type C is 30,000 yuan. The international standard is shown in the table on the left:</p>
<p>Applicable provisions of the Military Service Law Item Amount of preferential fee payable</p>
<p>Article 24, paragraph 1 Those who go abroad on official business 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Article 24, paragraph 2 Students who have not graduated from high school 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Article 24, paragraph 2 Students who have not graduated from university 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Article 24, paragraph 3 Those who are being prosecuted for crimes punishable by imprisonment or more severe punishment 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Article 26, paragraph 1 Existing specialized technical employees of national defense industries who have been examined and approved (technicians) 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>Article 26, paragraph 1 Existing specialized technical employees of national defense industries who have been examined and approved (technicians) 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>Article 26, paragraph 2 Those who have graduated from a normal school recognized by the Ministry of Education and have been serving as elementary school teachers for more than one year and have passed the examination 30,000 yuan (To be continued)</p>
