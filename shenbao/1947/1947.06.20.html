<p>（案由）提出經濟改革方案，請公決。</p>
<p>（說明）我以先天貧　之國家，遭長期抗戰之破壞，人力物力均極凋敝，而多數知識份子之心理與技能，又不能與科學生產之偉大時代相適應，當與者無力興舉，當革者憚於改革，因循推演，貧困益甚。吁衡今日之經濟，實已面臨嚴重之危機，亟應對證下藥，確定改革方案，茲擬案據民生主義之精神及其社會化之原則，定今後處理一切經濟問題之方針，以國家資本爲中心，領導私人資本之活躍，以國營事業任其難，扶助民營事業任其易，凡一切有關財政，經濟。金融之措施，均着眼於國家遠大之利益，謹提出經濟改革方案，提案人行政院長張羣。</p>
<h3>穩定物價與幣值　公私銀行須使分布全國</h3>
<p>〔附件一〕，發揮人力，增加生產，（一）對於現在之生產事業，盡量予以保護，以安定在業，防止失業。（二）以有效之計劃，使新的生產建設事業逐漸增加，引導游閑坐食之人力，轉而參加生產。（三）獎勵科學發明，提倡勞動服務，以轉移士風，鼓勵創造事業之精神。（四）以計劃教育，配合計劃經濟，使人才之培養與生產之建設打成一片。</p>
<p>二，增產物資，穩定物價，（一）政府須透過農業生產貸款或採定購方式，期能促進米，麥，棉，豆等主要農產原料之生產，並運用其一部或大部。（二）政府須以原料供結廠商，或通過工業生產貸款，或採定購方式，期能促進麫粉，紗布，油，糖，燃料及其他日用必需品之生產，並運用其一部或大部。（三）政府須通過輸出品貸款或採定購方式，期能促進生絲，鑛砂，桐油，毛革，茶葉，豬榮輸出品之生產與輸出，以充實外匯基金。（四）政府當以民生日用必需品對官，兵，公教人員及生產工廠工人先作有計劃之供應與配合。此外，有餘之物資，則應都市之需要，作穩定物價之用，使囤積者無法居奇，以達到安定民生之目的。</p>
<p>三，穩定幣值，（一）迅速處理無須國家經營之企業，出售偽產業及剩餘物資，並整理稅收，以謀在短期內彌補財政之不足，防止通貨膨脹。（二）政府應有充分準備，並選擇適當時機，以整理幣制，期能逐漸恢復常態。（三）東北，台灣，新疆三地之幣制，須同時整理，使為一致。</p>
<p>四，改革金融制度，金融制度之改革，必須特別注意為國家經濟政策服務，以增加農工生產為其主要之目的，金融機構應各有主要之專門業務，使普遍商業化之現象得以消除，公私銀行並須有計劃的分布全國，使之成為有系統之金融網，不致集中於沿海少數都市，尤其是上海一隅，，其辦法：（一）以縣為金融制度之基層機構，扶植縣銀行之設立，以便利建設，並配合地方自治之推行。（二）縣銀行以每縣一行為原則，初辦時，其資本縣佔四成，中央六成，待縣自治工作次第完成時，中央資本逐漸减少，將來達到地方七成中央三成之比例，中央並應供給專門人才，予以業務上之輔導。（三）縣銀行視其業務之類別及需要，分別由中國農民銀行，交通銀行或中國銀行為其後盾。（四）土地金融係屬長期性質，必須政府指定專款與發行土地債券，始可濟事，至適當時期，則應另設專行，以司其事。在過渡期間，應充實農民銀行土地金融之資金，協助縣銀行開展業務。（五）中國農民銀行經營農田水利農業品之倉備，運轍加工以及土地貨款，以便利農民，扶助晨村繁榮為其專業之範圍。（六）交通銀行經營工鑛交通貸款，發展實業為其專業之範圍。（七）中國銀行經營國內外貿易放款及國際匯兌業務（包括僑匯，為其專業之範圍）。（八）郵政儲金匯業局吸收人民儲蓄存款，辦理小額匯款，並應與合作金庫合作之原則，本利之於農村，用之於農村之原則，以發展農村經濟。（九）中央合作金庫經營生產運輸等合作貸款，扶植各種合作社之組織及發展為其專業之範圍。（十）中央信託局專司信託·保險，對民衆之信託保險等業務，負輔導之任務。（十一）中央銀行為銀行之銀行，以調劑全國金融，使金融與經濟密切聯繫，以完成經濟建設為其主要之職責。（十二）四聯總處俟復員完成後，改爲設計與聯繫之機構，或與財政部錢幣司合併，改設金融管理局，隸屬於財政部，以一專權。（十三）對於省市銀行及普通銀行，政府應為合理有效之指導與管制。（十四）各國家銀行應依其性質，實行專業化，對其性質相同之普通銀行業務，負聯繫輔導之任務，其設置分支行之範圍及地點，並應依其業務對象，分別予以親定。</p>
<h3>發展農工商各業　以人民生產能力及其總收入　支持整個國家之財政</h3>
<p>五，農業，農民佔絕對之多數，農業為中國經濟之骨幹，農業發達，農村繁榮，農民有其購買力，然後工業有所憑籍，社會得以安定，故發展農業，繁榮農村，乃今後經濟政策實施之主要對象，其辦法：（一）改革農地之分配關係，使能充分改良，利用租佃關係，應依「二五减租」之原則，澈底推行，並儘量設法實現「耕者有其田」，使農民充分從事生產。（二）舉辦集體農塲，利用新式機器及方法，增加生產，以示範於農民，並擴充農業試騐研究塲所，以增進生產技術。（三）農業改革，水利為重，大型水利工程及幹渠之修築，應由國家積極舉辦，小型水利工程及支渠之修築，應由中央督促省縣辦理，准許發行水利公債，其已完成之工程，並由地方政府負保養之責。（四）擴充合作社及互助社等之組織，確實便利農貸，以减輕農民所受高利貸之壓迫。（五）積極普遍建築倉儲制度，以保護人民生產之利益。（六）廣設苗圃，提倡造林，並須以有效之辦法，保持其成長。困利用農暇，訓練農民以土木石工等技術，並發展農村副業，以提高農民生活。（八）發展畜牧，並予以輔助及保障。（九）獎勵漁業，並保護發展之。</p>
<p>六，工業，非有自足之民生工業為農業之保護，使農工交流互濟，則中國經濟之基礎不能確立，故目前發展工業，當以民生工業為急切之圖，政府並急須改善工業環境，保陣工業利潤，並予工業貸款以最大之便利。同時，訂立全盤建設計劃，確定國營，地方營，民營範圍，分類，分區，明細規定，督促實施，並預定其分年生產量，合政府與人民之力，分期成立之，其辦法：（一）發展機械及化學工業之第一期，應力求適應農林之需要解決水利工程，化學肥料，農具倉庫，運輸工具等問題，（二）工業建設，應盡量分設在燃料，原料便宜之內地。（三）若干工業，先從裝備工程辦，一部份零件購自國外，逐漸發展到全盤製造的工業。（四）除幹綫鐵路，大規模水力發電廠及鋼鐵廠，鑛業等規定由國營或地方營者外，其餘工業盡量鼓勵民間以合作方式經營。（五）鼓勵若干製造之業，同時用力於工業試騐及地質勘測，使獲得進步及新的發明。（六）特別着重利用農暇，發展農村手工業，內而適應都市需要，外而適應國際之需要。（七）適應工業發展及出口貨物之需要，開發各種鑛產。（八）政府應集合公私立銀行，組織復興金融公司，以長期資金投資於工鑛建設事業，並要利用華僑資金及存放國外之外匯資產，投資於該公司，以向國外購入機器及原料。（九）銀行對於工鑛事業之貸款，應確實監督其用於生產，並接受廠房機器等固定資產為押品，不得限於原料及成品價值之半數為貸款之標準，尤不得採預扣利息，擅收手續費等不合理之方法，以增加工業成本之負擔，（十）由日本拆遷之工廠設備，除必須國營者外，應責由各業承辦，拆遷運輸裝置開工，國內現有之敵偽工鑛事業標售不脫者，應租與民營。（十一）工資應力求合理，各省市應普遍實施工資評議制，以求生產秩序之安定，勞資合力，以增加生產。</p>
<p>七，商業·入超過鉅，為國民經濟之大病，政府應以有效之方法鼓勵輸出，以謀對外貿易漸趨平衡，其辦法：（一）國內貿易，應儘量利用金融機構之調劑與水陸空運輸之便利，激勵懋遷，以增加全國之貿易總量，促進均衡之發展。（二）國際貿易，在進口方面，除生產工具原料及圖　儀器外，應設法嚴加限制，以節省不必要外匯支出，並應儘量利用貿易金融機構，獎勵並輔助民營，國人存在國外之外匯存款，尤應依照經濟緊急措施方案，迅予執行。（三）出口事業，應予積極獎勵，其所得外匯，得採進出口許可連鎖辦法，以發展進出口之業務，並應斟酌改善曁擴展各種特產，使之標準化，以作主要之輸出貨物，農村手工藝品，亦應以合作社方式，加以組織並改進，集中辦輸出，以平內超。（四）責成全國合作社物品供銷處與國際合作聯盟之國際合作貿易委員會及各國批發合作社切取聯繫，並試行物物交換制。</p>
<p>八，交通，（一）鐵路何者為幹綫，何者為支綫，由中央正式公布。其幹綫由中央全力經營，支綫在中央管理制度下，許可並鼓勵地方及民間經營。（二）公路工程，除省會與省會間之國道，由中央下，鼓勵各省建造，中央以財力·人力輔助之。若干支綫由省鼓勵各縣建造，公路運輸，鼓勵人民經營。（三）飛機塲由政府經營，航空事業盡力鼓勵人民經營。（四）航道幹綫由中央疏濬，支綫由省疏濬，最小之支綫，由縣疏濬，港口車要者由中央經營，次要者由市經營，凡由省市經營之航道·港口，均由中央以財力及人民輔助之，航業盡量最勵民間經營。（五）電報由中央經營，航空航運等在海空中待殊需要之無綫電台，在中央管理下，應准其自行設置（六）長途電話幹綫由中央敷設，各省支綫由省敷設，中央助之，縣鄉支綫由縣敷設，省助之。（七）市電話在與長途配合的管理之下，或勵人民經營。</p>
<p>九，財政，（一）政府應速保　並扶植農田出產，以裕田賦收入，保障並扶植工業生產，以裕直貨兩稅收入，保障並扶植貿易事業，以裕關稅收入，保障並扶植鹽業，以裕　稅收入，應以數萬萬人民之生產能力及其總收入，支持整個國家之財政。（二）去年修正之中央與地方財政收支系統，縣（市）級財政固較前充裕，而省級財政以財源較少，支用浩繁，收支失其平衡，應由中央主管機關與各省政府協商，重行改訂，務使地方財源足敷自力更生之需要。（三）自前直·貨·關·鹽四稅稅率，對於　時經濟　境米能適合，因是　　能充分把糧稅源，平均人民　提，應加調整。（四）調整個　　稱，嚴密控制稅源，簡化　　手續，以革除積弊，而裕稅收。（五）未出售之　偽產業及剩餘物資，　運儘量出售，其不必由政府經營之生產及交通專業，應售與人民經營或出售股票，以裕收入。（六）兩庫所需，除整頓稅收外，應以發行有價證券之途徑取諸人民，並使富有財力者有較重之負担。（七）以建國之需要，定機關之存廢，過份龐大之機構，必須緊縮，駢枝重複之機關，必須裁併。（八）非國家迫切之需要及有利於生產建設之支出，必須節約停止。</p>
<h3>各省市徵借糧食　本年起一律停辦　克服遊資作崇納入正軌</h3>
<p>十·糧政，（一）自卅六年度起，各省市繳借糧食一律停辦，以輕人民負担，其歷年借糧，應還本息，由中央參酌到期時各地糧價核定折率，以法幣撥還，不再抵繳田賦，以便淸償。（二）卅六年度各省市田賦仍暫行徵收實物，以應國家需要，但糧產不豐，交通不便地　，折徵法幣，其折徵地區及折　標準，由糧食部查酌情形，分別核定。（三）田賦收徵所得實物，其應屬省市縣地方所得部份，照鄰近徵幣地區折徵標準，由中央撥款收購，其附近徵幣之省縣公糧，縣公糧仍為地方運用，不予收購。以利軍食之統籌兼顧，地方之支應。（四）微幣縣市田糧機關一律我撤，其事務歸縣市政府辦理，徵實縣市及省級田糧機關，仍予保留，其經費完全由中央負祖。（五）常平倉制度亟須建立，長江流域各重要地點，必須於本年度內完成初步建倉儲糧計劃，地方積穀，亦應加強推動，普遍實施，以厚儲備。（六）中國農民銀行對於農倉備押，農產運銷業務，應積極推廣，期以金融力量，協同政府扶助生產，控制糧源，調劑盈虛。</p>
<p>十一，引導游資納入正軌，當前經濟最大之病態，即為游資集中，競爭投機，游資所向，風浪隨興，欲使經濟入於正常狀態，一面需要根本籌策，一面有先克服游實之作祟，故引導游資參加生產，乃當前切要之圖，其辦法：（一）國家銀行配合生產建設計劃，對於正當企業予以低利之貸款及保障，迅速確實使正當企業無仰賴高利貸款之必要。（二）規定利率之最高額，越過規定之高利貸，不予保陣，並懲罰之。（三）在過渡時期，國家銀行毋妨以最高之利息吸收游資，轉用於生產，所存放之利息差額，政府自行貼補之。（四）准許人民以黃金向中央銀行按牌價請購外匯，為購買許可進口物品之用，並准以黃金為優先購買政府出售國營生產事業及敵偽產業之用。（五）政府指定國家銀行，舉辦黃金儲蓄存款或發行金公債，均優給利息並予保障，特組監理委員會監督之。（六）取締　機操縱，建立健全合理之證劵市塲。</p>
<p>十二，吸收國外資本，加強生產建設，（一）政府應以優惠方式，歡迎國外資本，以助國內工業之發展。（二）若干種類工業，並可與外資合作經營。（三）便利僑匯，優予公平匯率，並獎勵保陣僑民投資，予以興辦國內各種工業之便利。（四）登記國民存放，國外之外匯資產，使之用於國內生產建設</p>
<p>十三，合理解決官·兵·公教員·工之待遇，（一）實施配給制度，使官·兵·公教員·工能維持最低必需之生活。（二）政府負責為官·兵·公教員·工解決子女教育問題。（三）嚴格實施同地同酬，同工同酬原則，以减除各機關員工待遇懸殊之現象。</p>
<p>十四，嚴懲以政治力量便利私人企業之行為，官商不分，偏公濟私，良好之經濟政策，可以變質，社會上有一部份私人企業，受特殊之待遇，則正當之民間工商業，皆受摧殘，此為施行經濟政策有效之先決條件，必須嚴格執行。</p>
<p>十五，健全經濟組織，為謀政府與人民之合作，使經濟政策惟行盡利，經濟·財政·金融息息相通，為一整體，必須照顧全局，通盤打算，以往行政院各部各自為政，而最高經濟委員會等同虛設，民間對經濟政策之反應，亦無由溝通表達，爲挽救此弊，其辦法：（一）政府應健全全國經濟委員會之組織，負設計督導，實行經濟政策之責任。（二）社會方面應發動廣大之經濟建設運動，提高民間對經濟建設之了解與興趣，並以官民協作之力量，排除經濟建設之困難。</p>

<h3>全國經濟委員會決議　財產稅改稱建國捐　國營事業估價標準決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕各方注意之一次財產稅征收問題，全國經委會十九日午後四次會開會時曾詳加討論，並有激辯，決議將一次財產稅改名為「建國特別捐」，收原則決定：（一）提高起捐點（可能為三億或五億起征），（二）目標為富戶，（三）在較大城市　辦，（四）由民意機關提名，經調查後核定捐額，（五）詳細辦法由財政小組草擬，提下次會中討論。</p>
<p>會中對出售國營事業問題，亦曾加以討論，決議在七月底前完成估價，　價，出售手續，並將組一佔價委會，專司估價工作。估極標準聞決定以廿六年物價為基數，參照目前市價估定。</p>
<p>國營事業貼補問題，會中亦曾加以討論，原則上鐵路，公路·郵·電·煤·煤斤·取消貼補，惟有特殊情形者，則採逐漸减少辦法。按政府所化於貼補之國帑，月達三千億之鉅，取消後對平衡預算當六有助。</p>

<h3>遠東經會昨開全體委會　各代表意見紛歧　今晨決先舉行小組會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會昨日上下午分別舉行第一及第二次全體委員會會議，討論聯合國經濟社會理事會所決議「亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會應担任搜集關於經濟復與更多之資料，並從事調查，如有需要，則尚須實地攷察，然後將結果向下屆理事會議提供報告」一案。各代表發表意見甚多，且多紛歧。最後通過美代表戴維斯之建議：「由本會全體委員會組織一小組委員會，商討理事會之決議案。同時附加討論本會各會員所提出之意見，由本會主席請各代表提出具體建議，小組委員會則應根據其中最緊要者討論，俾節省時間」。</p>
<p>全體委員會因之決定於今晨九時半由各國代表組織一小組委員會，舉行會議，根據各代表建議，擬定工作程序，然後提交全體委員會討論決定。</p>
<p>今晨十時半之會，則由經委會繼續舉行第七次會議，討論大會臨時議事規則，該規則業經審查小組委員會數次會議審查。</p>
<p>印代表提出問題</p>
<p>昨晨全體委員會議開始後，印度代表奈魯即謂：亞洲曁遠東各國，目前無不急盼建設工作之開始，故一切初步調查工作均應儘可能迅速實行，故提出下列間題：（一）何以聯合國經社理事會需要吾人擔任集更多資料，而不指示吾人根據已有資料，採取積極與直接之調查工作？</p>
<p>（二）秘書處歐洲經濟委員會對此事如何進行？理事會是否亦需該會搜集更多資料？</p>
<p>（三）吾人固知歐洲工作團在分析資料撮要時，曾提示該團所需補充之材料為何。亞洲方面是否亦有此項提示？</p>
<p>（四）當理事會首數次舉行會議時，曾請秘書長特別着爭研究聯合國中曾受戰爭損毀之國家所需之短期及長期經濟援助。此事已否進行？本會可否得到一份報告以資參考？</p>
<p>兩秘書分別答復</p>
<p>經委會副執行秘書羅森博當即答稱：關於調查工作之性質及如何看手調查，均可由本委會會議商決，故秘書處不宜擬就確定之程序。</p>
<p>理事會助理秘書長沃文補充答覆謂：秘書長為調查聯合國中受戰爭損毀國家之情形，會組織一調查團，用訊間方式研究，現關於歐洲方面之答覆已送交歐洲委員會。</p>
<p>英代表提出建議</p>
<p>英代表克羅即提議：（一）本會秘書處可根據下列數點提出訊問：A，亞洲及遠東各受捐毀區內之交通情形，尤宜注重鐵路及水路；B，煤斤之生產及區別，與可能供應之方法，C，訓練有關經濟之高級行政人員及技術人員之種種便利。（三）由各會員國推舉代表一人，組織顧問委員會，協助秘書處進行工作。（三）調查報告提交下屆委員會會議討論。渠並稱：本會目前尚無法派遣調查團往各地調查，但可派會員一人赴任何國家調查，以補充資料之供給。</p>
<p>蘇代表又加反對</p>
<p>蘇代表史迭辛柯反對英代表之提議謂：沃文氏已說明秘書長已向各國詢間，而答覆尚未接到，故本會不應再予重複。英代表之提議範圍似太狹窄，本會目的體更為廣泛，應採取具體步驟組織二個或三個實地考察隊，以研究亞洲及遠東各國之需要，將其報告提交下屆會議。</p>
<p>中美代表之建議</p>
<p>美代表　維斯謂：在未定出一計劃以前，不宣開始實地考察工作，工作團之報告可用為工作計劃之起點。渠建　在着手研究前，本會應指示秘書處，依照工作緩急，排定計劃。本代表團則隨時將所需調查各點，列表提交大會。</p>
<p>我國代表李　則謂：中國代表團目前尚不能提出完備之題目建議大會。渠建議最好根據全體代依新認為急於調查諸共同研究一方案，提交經委會。</p>
<p>蘇代表問：詢問表格係發給何國家？包括何種問題？</p>
<p>經委副執行秘書長羅森博答稱：詢問表格包括經濟，外匯及其他問題，各遠東及亞洲國家受戰一爭損失者皆在被詢之列。各代表一如需此項表格，可發給一份以備參考。</p>
<p>蔣廷　指出兩點</p>
<p>主席蔣廷　當即指出：（一）關於搜集資料一點，本會應予秘書處以具體之指示；（二）關於實地調查事，問題甚複雜，時間亦恐虞不足，故在事前須依問題之重要性為先後，而撰擇調查對象。目前因本委員會經費上之限制，恐不能將各種問題皆作實地調查。</p>
<p>美方捉議獲通過</p>
<p>下午繼續開會，主席將廷　因事缺席，由副主席瓜德諾代理。主席將美代表之提議，即另組織一小組委員會，以討論各代表之意見等，交全體委員會付表決。但蘇聯代表即表示反對，並謂：如此，即謂英代表之提議將為討論之根　。同時何以主席將美代表之提議先付表決，而印代表及本人所提者則不付表決？</p>
<p>澳代表則附議美代表提議。經委員會通過。旋即由主席請各代表對工作團報告發表意見，印代表及英代表者，對此項報告表示贊同。委員會於四時一刻　會。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>公務員退休撫卹制的確立</h3>
<p>本月十二日立法院例會，通過修正「公務員退休法」，「公務員撫卹法」，將由國府公佈施行。在政府厲行政治革新之際，人事行政主管爲永久確定公務員退休撫卹制度，將抗戰期間公佈之公務員退休撫卹兩項　規，根據現在情况，作必要的修正，實爲人事行政極重要的措施。</p>
<p>人事行政，爲廿世紀之新名詞，行政法學者闡揚其爲一種科學。惟人事行政與實際運用，不可偏廢，且人事管理之實用，早於學理與法典。現代資本主義國家，運用人事行政於工商管理，會發揮高度的效率，英美民主國家運用人事行政於機關管理，確立了健全的公務員制度，幷增強良好的行政效率。所謂「公務員」者，泛指一切從事公共的職務的人員。英國公務員制度最完美，大臣爲「政務官」，去留依黨派關係決定，事務官則為「專家」，依法任用，久居其位，老於部務，不問黨派，有專門學識和事務經騐，其升調退休撫卹，有規可循，任何黨派入閣，對彼輩同樣尊敬，鮮有歧視。美國公務員的範圍較廣泛，凡經職位分類的人員，及未經職位分類的人員，如競考人員，公立學校敎員，公營事業勞工等，均爲公務人員，但不包括總統及政務官。我國公務員，含義亦廣泛，依新刑法第十條規定：「稱公務員者，謂依法令從事於公務之人員」。公務員服務法第廿四條規定：「本法以受有俸給之公務員及其他公營事業機關服務人員均適用之」。依此解釋，凡從事於公共職務之人員，都是公務員；無論政務官事務官，無論雇用聘任或地方自治人員，皆稱公務員。範圍旣廣，解釋至難，舉凡任用升調考績，其習慣與法律理路棼亂，退休撫卹，更未顧及。民國廿三年有「公務員卹金條例」公佈，察其內容，華而不實，所謂公務員保障，祇徒托空言而已。</p>
<p>最近立法院完成「公務員退休法」，「公務員撫卹法」立法程序，實爲健全公務員人事行政之先聲，抑且爲政治民主化之關鍵。退休與撫卹，本是老弱傷亡的安全保障；退休金亦稱退養金與卹金，同爲撫卹救濟制度，本是國家對公務員服務的報酬，也是公務員盡忠職守應享的權利。國家設此制度的目的，在促進行政效率，並非發自悲憫心腸；公務員享此　利，其本人及家屬有一定的保障，自必能集中精力，心無旁鶩，並視公共服務爲終身事業。所以說，公務員退休撫卹制度，是現代良好的制度，值得提倡，並足供一切公共事業機關之效法，現在該兩項法案已經立院通過，卽將公佈施行，惟其內容及施行後應注意事項，尙有待商榷者，申論如次，期望有關當局能注意及此。</p>
<p>一，公務員含義太狹。我國現行法規，所指公務員，範圍廣泛，而該兩項法案第二條，規定「本法所稱公務員，除長警外，以現職經銓叙機關審定資格登記有案者爲限。」其範圍似太狹，有失退休撫卹制度普及實施之義，關於政務官應否解釋為公務員，依「公務員服務法」解釋，政務官應視為公務員，該兩項法案亦規定政務官準用退休撫卹之所定，是已承認政務官為一種公務員。但該兩項法案所指公務員，乃以銓叙有案者為限，習慣上政務官幷不經過銓叙，其應否享受退休撫卹權利，或適用該兩項法案規定，不無疑義，因此，一方面限制了低級公務員，及未經銓叙之公務員，狹隘了公務員的含義，另一方面又優遇政務官，有失公平。</p>
<p>二，退休年限問題。英制規定公務員年達六十五歲，及服務在十年以上者，可得退休支領退養金：美制規定年達六十歲以上，及服務在十五年以上者，得退休支領退養金，均縮短其服務年限。我國「公務員退休法」第三條，規定任職卅年以上或任職十五年以上年齡屆滿六十歲者，始得聲請退休幷給與退休金，年限過長。須知公務員服務年限過長，官僚習氣濃厚，共同意志缺乏，致易形成吏治機關之無能。就理論與事實言，退休年限，不應過長。抑有進者，習慣與法律，元寶事務官任職卅年退休，政務官可凖用此規定，試問今天世界各國的政務官，有任職卅年退休的習慣與法律否？此項類推規定，殊非善良之策。</p>
<p>三，退休金與撫卹金籌措方法，依「公務員退休法」規定，退休之公務員得支領年退休金及一次退休金，其數額以退職之月俸額合成年俸作百分比計算：依「公務員撫卹法」規定，公務員因公死亡或在職十五年以上病故者，其遺族得按其月俸額合成年俸作百分比計算，於廿年內繼結支領撫卹金。惟此項經費籌措方法如何，在國家預算上佔何位置，憲法基本國策旣未列有專條，該兩項法案復未概括或列舉，將來的問題必多。緣各國關於退休金撫卹金之籌措，通行的辦法有兩種：一爲政府擔負制，卽全由政府經費負擔之謂；一爲政府與公務員共同擔負制，卽各擔負」部之謂，政府方面由經常費撥付，公務員方面由平日薪俸項下扣存。我國公務員，待遇微薄，平日枵腹從公，如再扣存其薪俸，以備養老，必動　其服務意志，故今後退休金撫卹金之籌措，仍以採用政府擔負制爲宜。</p>
<p>由上所論，可知公務員退休撫卹制確立之重要，在學理上事實上，應予修正或注意部份，希望立法和行政當軸，豫謀救濟之道，不要使這個完美的制度，發生任何遺憾。年前該兩項法案在陪都公佈時，一般公務員並不重視，人事行政主警亦未實施，是因爲內容上不無問題。但此次修政案較前進步了，有待商榷之端，尙能作有效的教濟，使這一良好的制度建立起來，不僅為公務員之幸，幷且為國家走向憲政民主的途徑。</p>
<h3>張厲生籲請新聞界　减少刋載黃色新聞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕內政部長張厲生，十九日下午三時半於勵志社招待記者，以誠懇態度剴切向新聞界呼籲减少刋戴黃色新聞。張氏認為邇來若干報紙之社會新聞報道及副刋作品，每迎合低級趣味，繪聲繪色，影響風俗及人心至鉅。渠認為文字渲染過甚，則流於誨浮誨盜之嫌。張氏於結論時特強調籲請各報刋，今後發表有關社會新聞，於法律，道德，公益各觀點特加審愼與顧念，本教育人羣之積極精神，發揮與論之眞實意義，减少殮壞性之渲染刺激，而多作有效議論。張都長並特別指明，報紙在中國，對社會教育尤具特殊重要價值。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕四聯繼處十九日上午開第三四六次理事會議，張副主席　主持，旋即討論：（一）政府近正擬訂經濟改革方案，對增加生產，穩定物價兩點尤爲重視。爲配合政府政策，擬具定貨貸款及實物貸款原則，先行試辦，惟應由政府各主管機關商定適用範圍，並選擇若干种物資，分別擬訂辦理定貨或收購計劃。在農業方面，並應特別注重農日水利貸款及局部試辦有關農田改良之實物貸放爲原則，決送請全國經委會核議。（二）出口物資事業因經營運銷，需資週轉，迭曾貸款協助，並曾訂定「國家行局辦理出口國外物資貸款辦法」通行辦理，惟目前物價未穩，若干廠家於獲得貸款購囤貨物後，每有意存觀望待價而沽之舉，於借款到期之時，申請展期，若漫無限制，旣失協導推廣之原意，復難兔助長囤積之趨勢。當經決議，各行局依照原辦法承做各類放款，無論押匯，所押款均應於俗到期時收回，不得續展。（三）我國燃料用油，大部仰給舶來品，漏巵甚鉅，政府為自達自煉節省外匯支出起見，近已由中國石油公司及國營招商局投資組織中國油輸公司，負責統籌飛機及國防工業所需各種油料。該公司現以擴展業務，開關外洋航綫並充寶油輪設備及添建碼頭倉庫需資週轉，當經決議，核准貸款協助。</p>

<h3>蘇拒絕英法呼籲　不願參與討論卿計劃　貝文返抵倫敦憂形於色</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕貝文已於今日自巴黎返倫敦，表情似甚嚴肅，憂形於色。渠向記者表示，除昨夜發表之公報及今晨在巴黎宣布之蘇聯拒絕英法呼籲外，別無其他可述。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十九日電〕蘇聯已於今日經由其駐巴黎大使館拒絕英法之邀其共同會談，以討論實行馬歇爾之歐洲復興計劃。巴黎各界聞悉此消息後，均覺貝文皮杜爾獲取大陸合作之努力，終必歸於失敗無疑。蘇大使館發表之公報，嚴辭聲明蘇聯認爲依照馬歇爾在哈佛大學宣布之建議而發動之任何歐洲復興計劃，均屬「不可能」者。此間外交界人士對蘇聯之答覆感覺悲痛而並不覺驚異，此項答覆已證實眞理報前此斥馬卿計劃爲使歐洲渝爲華爾街附庸的計劃之意見。貝文外相今午應歐禮和總統之宴以前，曾在旅邸招待記者，宣稱已與皮杜爾外畏成立協議，以設立特別歐洲經濟委員會以執行馬歇爾之計劃，期以美國之援助促成歐洲之　後復興。此一委員會將設四技術委員會，附屬於聯合國機構歐洲經濟委員會之機構內，以分別研究全歐之煤斤，鋼鐵，運輸及農業等四大問題。貝文表示將繼續努力以覓取蘇聯之合作，不果，英美之計劃仍將付諸施行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：此間晚報外交訪員稱：蘇聯可能接受英法之邀請，參加歐洲經濟委會，但對馬歇爾之建議，或將提出反建議。蘇方主張歐洲復興計劃不應在美方指導下進行，而應經由聯合國隊洲經濟委會辦理一切。聞英國駐蘇大使彼特遜今日曾與莫洛托夫作初步談判，已將結果電吿貝文。員文今日返倫教，定下午向下院報吿。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十九日電〕遽權威外交界消息稱：蘇聯外長莫洛托夫對馬歇爾復興歐洲之發展表示頗感興趣，但渠在此項計劃未加闡明前，拒絕作正式談話。</p>
<h3>英法外長邀請莫洛托夫　會商歐經濟重建　蘇聯如予拒絕英法將單獨進行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十八日電〕英外長貝文與法外長皮社爾在此磋商兩日後，今日聯合邀請蘇聯外長莫洛托夫於六月廿三日參加會議，討論美國援助歐洲復興計劃。聯合請東提議蘇聯倘　意參加，則英法蘇三國可在彼此同意之適當地點開會。據英國消息靈通人士稱，三國會議地點以倫敦與巴黎最爲適宜。英法雙方代表均稱兩外長並未考慮蘇聯拒絕參加之可能性。可靠方面私下表示，蘇聯答復倘爲否定性質，或不得要領，則英法將置之不顧，決照馬歇爾擬定計劃進行。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕蘇聯對英法邀請其參加談判之態度如何，已成此間政界人士最關心之問題。自蘇聯在東歐之經濟勢力以及馬歇爾之聲明其計劃內可稱之歐洲係包括亞洲以西一切部份之言觀，蘇聯顯然應爲響應馬卿計劃之主持國之一。觀察家預料蘇聯可能將採取下列二種態度：（一）蘇聯爲避免明晰之決議，將阻止該計劃之進展，使美國國會不及於年內就該計劃採取行動。（二）蘇聯本身若拒絕參加馬卿之計劃，但或將令東歐小國參加該計劃之主持機構，以拖延或破壞其工作。又據探悉捷克及南斯拉夫之代表昨曾以專家地位向法國官方探詢馬卿計劃。若干觀察家認此乃東歐國家參加馬卿計劃之第一步行動。</p>
<h3>英法談判經過　通知美蘇兩國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎電〕英法兩國外長於本日午前會晤之後，又於午後五時再度會晤，貝文外機定於今晚與英大使特夫古柏進餐，明晨十時即乘坐飛機返國。關於馬歇爾國務卿所提歐洲經濟復興計劃，英法兩國官員準時進行談判討論此一問題，法國外長並曾延見蘇聯代辦亞伐浴夫，吿以英法兩國會談之經過。此外又悉：英法兩國談話之詳細經過，亦已通知美國大使館云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十八日電〕頃據負責人士談稱：英國駐蘇大使彼特遜爵士，昨晚曾訪晤蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，將英國政府對於馬歇爾國務卿所提援助歐洲計劃之觀點，吿知莫洛托夫外長。此外又悉：法國駐蘇代辦廈本蒂埃於本日午後亦曾訪晤蘇聯外次馬里特，將法國政府對於馬帥所提計劃之備忘錄，提交馬里特外次。</p>
<h3>美駐蘇大使返任</h3>
<p>將向蘇解竊馬卿計劃</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十八日電〕英駐蘇大使彼特遜今吿記者稱：馬氏之計劃主要爲關於受戰禍各國之經濟　後第宜署，故島克　及白俄羅斯可能單獨參加該計州，一如其參加聯總援助然。且參加該項計劃並不牽涉商務協定，目前有關國家之主要需要，似為提供其迫切需要之詳情，而不必言及其所能供應者爲何。美駐滬大使將於今晚抵此，預料渠將以馬歇爾計劃之全部情形，吿知莫洛托夫，俾蘇聯能決定其對此項計劃之態度。</p>
<h3>調查匈牙利軍事設施　蘇聯拒絕美要求　英仍將促蘇報告匈政情</h3>
<p>〔中央社布達佩斯十八日合衆電〕盟國管制匈牙利委員會主席（蘇聯代表）使維里杜夫已拒絕美國關於調查匃軍事設施之要求。其理由爲委員會委員無權作此種調查，並謂，渠將以此項請求送交蘇佔領當局官員攷慮。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕國務大臣麥克尼爾告下院稱：政府正在等待駐蘇大使彼特遜之報告，向蘇聯繼續要求獲取關於匈牙利局勢情報之結果。麥氏於答覆議員之問題時，認派遣事實調查委員團至匈牙利及東南歐之議爲不可能，復認不宜根據目前所知關於匈國局勢之有限情報即向聯合國機構提起申訴。關於匈牙利前復興部長密斯泰樞及農民黨等黨員四十三人被控叛國由法庭審判之案，麥氏表示英駐匈代表當密切注意該案之發展，惟以該案審判歷時必久，故未便派還視察員列席旁聽全案之歷次庭訊。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕英駐蘇大使彼特遜今日吿英國記者稱，渠於星期二夜訪莫洛托夫時，以匈牙利問題為主題，曾討論余所提出之英政府就匈國局勢之意見書，而莫氏對於所謂「英國之繼續千涉匈國內政」，似露不耐煩之意，當余吿以匈牙利迄仍受停戰協定之管轄時，莫氏似無動於中者。</p>
<h3>匈牙利反對黨　責政府違憲</h3>
<p>政治犯已開始審訊</p>
<p>〔路透社匈京十八日電〕反對黨議員今日在國民議會中，指責內閣在要求獲得全權前，不向國會要求信任票爲違憲的行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社匈京十八日電〕被控叛國罪而被起訴之四十三被吿之一，前農民黨議員漢恩，今日在庭上供稱，渠在獄中所受之特遇，使其失去知覺達一星期之久，故不知其所簽者爲何。對於庭上所宣讀渠之供辭，實不能負責。該供辭指前總理那基曾與其他農民黨領袖密組地下軍及建立地下軍火庫，所藏為裁軍委員會所不知之軍火。匈運轍部長共黨領袖特魯已有兩星期未曾在匈京出現，引起各方面之揣測，一說特氏已負某項特殊使命赴法國。</p>
<h3>克萊頓希望蘇聯　參與美援歐計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕馬歇爾復興歐洲計劃中之要角，即副國務卿克葉頓，頃表示美國希望蘇聯協力給養飢餓之歐洲。克萊頓在招待記者會中長論馬歇爾經濟援助歐洲之計劃，歷一小時之久，指出兩大要點如次：（一）蘇聯以前爲一糧食，纖維，燃料輸出國家，故亦應協助解決歐洲之經濟困難，尤其是援助蘇聯澳境一帶國家。（二）國務院已接獲蘇聯本年米　豐收之報吿，各記者至此即提出各項詢問，但克萊頓避不作正面答覆，僅謂經濟援助歐洲計劃尙未決定具體方式，最後辦法尙待取決於歐洲各國。克萊頓繼謂：余現將取道倫敦前往日內瓦參加國際貿易會議，希望此行能聽取各方對馬歇爾計劃之意見，但幷不擬與各方進行會談。關於范登堡所主張組織兩黨特別會議，以決定美國之援助世界計劃一事，余表示贊同。</p>
<h3>普遍裁軍案　臨重大危機蘇聯可能行使否決權</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十九日電〕聯合國機構各國代表，今日成認爲蘇聯對於美國普遍裁軍方案若果運用否決權，則聯合國機構之裁軍努力，實際將由此吿終。蘇聯運用否決權之可能性，係因聯合國軍備委員會十八日已通過美國執行計劃，送交安全理事會，並將蘇聯提案否決。新聞記者羚會議後詢問蘇聯代表葛羅米柯，此案提交安理會時果將　何進行，葛氏答稱，我人當靜以觀之。據若干代表猜測，葛羅米柯攤運用否決權，且認爲葛氏若果出此，則聯合國機構內之普遍裁軍步驟，實際將由此壽終正寢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十八日電〕聯會國安全理事會各代表今日聞已同意，如在目前催促投票表決編組國際警備軍有關各大問題，必歸徒然。目前欲藉票決方式解決各項爭點，必將引起蘇聯運用一連串否決權，致使整個計劃蒙受損害。</p>
<h3>超空堡壘十一架　運抵土地耳其　英艦隊下月訪土</h3>
<p>〔路透社伊斯坦埠十八日電〕此間可靠方面稱：土耳其政府向美國所購之超空堡壘十一架，業已運抵土國，此說迄猶未能經官方證實。若干日前土陸軍飛機在史密爾那爲美空軍顧問作表演飛行時，其中曾有超空堡壘一架。</p>
<p>〔路透社伊斯坦埠十八日電〕土國報紙稱：英航空母艦兩艘。巡洋艦一艘·驅逐艦二艘，將於下月訪問伊斯坦埠。</p>

<h3>蘇聯已獲知　原子彈秘密　華爾許發出警告</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日〕杜魯門總統所任命負責處理强迫軍役問題之諮詢委員會主席華爾許，本日在衆院海陸空軍委員會陳述意見稱，余深知蘇聯已有製造原子炸彈之秘密，蘇聯刻正企圖利用聯合國機構以爭取時間，當可在三四年內完成原子彈之製造云。</p>
<h3>英代表團今日啟程赴蘇　準備舉行重要貿易談判　目的在締結大規模商約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫十八日電〕商務部發言人今日宣稱：海外貿易司長威爾遜定二十日偕顧問十八人飛赴莫斯科，舉行重要英蘇談判，以締結大規模商約。政府宣佈此事，適當外長貝文在巴黎與法方商定推行美國務卿馬歇爾援歐復興方案之時，殊堪重視。先是，政府消息靈通要員曾謂，無論蘇聯參預馬氏計劃與否，英國願意與蘇聯簽訂貿易協定。英國進行英蘇貿易談判，基本原因厥在需要蘇聯木材與小麥，且深感「無意使蘇聯陷入經濟孤立」。</p>
<h3>義大利政局動盪　新人選未推定前總統允暫留職　加斯貝利內閣地位不穩</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十八日電〕尼古拉總統辭意堅決，但已允於選出新總統以前繼續供職。義各黨派領袖今日曾集商此一局勢，迄至目前爲止，尙未有人被推爲總統之繼任者，而加斯貝利內閣之命運同時亦再度動搖。內閣於日內將向制憲議會要求信任票。尼古拉總統之辭職，是否將自動造成內閣之辭職，迄猶不知，但無論如何，總統之辭職必將引起危機。尼古拉雖已允請於選出新總統以前繼績供職，但此舉對於緊張局勢之减輕，亦無多大效用。今夜消息謂，七十六齡之前總理波諾米，有基督民主及共產兩大黨之支持，可望繼任總統。制憲議會議長泰拉契尼，今日曾召議會各黨派領袖，討論選舉新總統之方法，加斯貝利希望總統得在內閣向議會要求信任票以前辭職。加氏預料議會能向其內閣投比較多數之信任票，此一希望如果實現，則總理或將向新總統提出內閣之辭呈，而新總統預料必能予以婉留。關於尼古拉辭職原因說素不一，加斯貝利之基督民主黨力稱，尼氏完全因身心疲勞而辭職，未曾參加內蘭之社會共產兩黨則謂，尼古拉之辭職係表示不信任內閣。</p>
<h3>美海員工潮　一部份已告解決</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕工業組織大會太平洋及各海岸海員工會調解員，頃已接受提高工資百分之五之建議，歷時三日之海運意工，至此已吿終止。但西海岸方面仍未解決。勞工部次長吉勃遜稱：資方及「工組」工會調解負已同意政府之建議，即海員合同延長一年，加付一年中九日例假之工資，並提高工資。</p>

<h3>英殖民部大臣宣稱　錫蘭將成自治領　英政府已開始籌備工作</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕殖民部大臣瓊斯今日在下議院宣稱，錫蘭島將即時舉行普選，使新議會得於今年十月成立，成立以後，即將開始採取措施，使該島（可能在十二個月內）成爲不列顚共和邦之自治領。如該島願意脫離不列顚共和邦，亦將任其脫離。瓊斯之宣言有云，英政府於一九四五年即聲明願與錫蘭人民合作，以促成其自治領地位，並表示在相當的短時期內，完成此一目的。爲使與錫蘭政府之談判不致拖延起見，英政府已令即時開始籌備工作，以起草必要之協定。</p>

<h3>日財閥暗中活躍　大量資金從事黑市貿易　處理財閥股票需時二三年之久</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十九日電〕盟軍總部最近雖曾稱，日本財閥所控制之工商及金融太上機構業被根本剷除，然財閥之勢力，仍甚活躍。商工及金融界百分之八十，仍爲彼等遙遙控制。據消息靈通人士稱：吾人甚易發現『財閥章魚」，僅有「觸角」遭受損害，其神經中心，固仍完好無損，各資產公司在組織及人事方面，雖候淸理，然其附屬公司，則由與財閥具有深切關係之人物監督，以獨立公司之姿態，照常營業，而遵照其裔主之命令行事。目前有種種證據，證明大量財閥資本，已從事黑市活動，並獲厚利。三井·三夔·住友·安田等四大財關之銀行，均未改組，且與其他與財閥有聯繫之「獨立公司」同樣經營。又在制止托辣斯法律規定下，公司之每一股東，仍可握全部股票百分之十，同時法律並不能制止股票持有者，用若干不同姓名，購買更多股票，以控制公司。股票雖由淸理委員會出賣，然按法律規定，各「獨立公司」之職員，有購買之優先權，因之在交納財產稅後，所有股利，即經該委會之手，移交財閥。如是則昔日財閥資本之大部份，仍將歸於財閥手中。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十九日電〕前第九一屆議會通過之「有價證券處分調整法」，現內閣已決定於十八日施行，根據該法所組織之有價證券處理調整協議會，亦於同日成立。蓋因財閥之解體，及特別經理公司之整理，大量之股票勞必公開向市塲拋出，而爲使其有獲得合理且民主之處分，於是創立此協議會，預料經過此會處分之股票額面將達二百億圓，在其處分上，至少恐需要二三年之時間。</p>

<h3>法內閣通過　財政新措施　總工會表反對</h3>

<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕法財長舒曼所提增加稅收减低軍政預算之強力緊縮計劃，大體已由法內閣通過，內閣定星期五開會，以對該計劃作最後決定。據自可靠刀面探悉，舒曼之計劃，包括取消國家對麵包牛乳煤斤之津貼，使各該物價格提高，增加火車票價，郵資，汽車稅，及菸草火柴售價等。全國總工會已於今日表示此一計劃，將對勞工階級增加不能容忍之負担，此一計劃或可補足預算一都份之不足，但生活費用必因之提高，使工人於最近罷工時爭得之利益又爲剝奪。全國總工會已要求自七月一日起修正全部工資薪金，此項要求如獲成功能，則長平衡預算之新努力，勢必大受打擊。</p>

<h3>蘇聯擬在世界各地　建立警察國家制度　杜勒斯評蘇聯世界政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社伊里諾州伊文斯頓十八日電〕莫斯科外長會議中曾任馬歇爾顧問之杜勒斯十八日向西北大學畢業班發表演說稱：蘇聯正採取在世界各地建立『警察國家」之政策。蘇聯如繼續採取此項政策，勢將引起戰爭。杜氏之言有謂：『蘇聯乃警察國家，蘇聯之統治者對此一制度深具信心，並認應推行於世界各地。蘇聯現正有效地實現此項信仰，匈牙利即爲其例。蘇聯推行世界各地「警察國家」制度之企圖，將引起普遍之衝突，甚至於戰爭，即使蘇聯人民亦並不皆樂於接受少數人之獨裁統治。　蘇聯境內政治犯之人數倍於共產黨員之人數也。警察國家與自由國家間之衝突決難妥協，吾人確應使聯合國有討論此事之機會，此事現正到處爲人討論中云。」</p>

<h3>蕭翁發表書面談話　擁護華萊士</h3>
<p>〔合衆社白魯塞爾十八日電〕九十高齡之英大文豪蕭伯納，頃向比利時發表書面談話，揄揚華萊士之和平運動演說，並表示擁護華萊士在一九四八年出任美總統。略謂，種種公式化之囈語，不足以避免第三次世界大戰，惟具有政治才幹之領袖，始能決定此局勢。茲將蕭伯納所答覆之各項問題，一併誌諸如次：</p>
<p>（問）先生以為華萊士屢次所作關於蘇聯與其他各國關係之言論，是否有助於促進和平運動？</p>
<p>（答）華萊士之言論，乃對吾人及歐洲之極大貢獻，足以證明美國人之見識，高於村夫小子，余希望能有足够之人、擁議華氏明年出任總統。</p>
<p>（問）先生能否提出一種公式，俾所謂西方國家能與蘇聯獲致諒解之基礎，以避免第三次世界大戰？（答）處今之世上自史達林，下至一貧如洗之人，絕無頭腦淸醒與公正無私之士而不認爲第三次世界大戰即破產與自殺之謂。故對此幾年之好景，應充份加以利用，勿失諸交臂。公式之囈語實無濟於事，政治才幹始能決定事態之進展，但亦非憲章，綱領，言論機關報所能奏效。</p>
<p>（問）所謂勝利國爲何不應以其較佳之糧食，給養所謂被征服國家？（答）惟對搖錢樹（能生金蛋之雌鵝），始値得爲其在一星期內絕食一二日，加以養育，目前所困難者，乃勝利國自己求食亦屬不易也。</p>
<p>（問）英國將否再留在印度，或再將留駐若干時日，何人關心及此，請問其故？（答）甘地，尼赫魯，眞納，蒙巴頓及數千無名之士，現正在孟買，拉霍爾，加爾各答，西北邊省等地，互相殘殺，他人以爲彼等關切印度，實則不足予言成敗。</p>
<h3>故羅斯福總統　批評華萊士　謂其朝秦暮楚</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕法萊在「柯里埃斯雜誌」著文稱：羅斯福在一九三八年曾反對華萊士爲未來之總統候選人，蓋華萊士之行爲，頗難捉摸也。法萊稱，余於一九三八年四月與羅斯福談話時、羅曾吿余：「華萊士可能爲總統候選人，然余（羅斯福自稱）却寗可贊成伊克斯、蓋伊克斯能堅持貫澈其主張，而華萊士行爲則朝秦暮楚，頗難確言也。」</p>

<p>勞資評斷會對工資爭執　議決兩項處理原則　評議各業糾紛力求簡單迅速　推定五小組人選分別辦理</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕勞資評斷委員會第十一次會議，昨日下午三時在社會局召開，出席及列席代表共二十餘人，由主任委員吳開先主持。經三小時之商討，通過工資評議辦法十五條，呈社會部備案，但內容並未發表。評斷會對工資爭議事項推定五小組處理，對解僱辦法，亦推定小組研究。其他當月工資是否依據上月指數發給及公用事業退職金等問題，因時間不及，留待今日下午三時繼續開會討論　對嗣後處埋各業工資紛爭，勞炎評斷會昨決定二項原則：（一）積極方面，希雙方共體時艱，能作公平解決。工友收入固望增加，同時亦應增加生產以减輕廠方負担。（二）消極方面，工廠經濟情形如確實不佳，不能負担者，可由評斷會斟酌情形，將工資予以折扣或核减。</p>
<p>五小組人選</p>
<p>該會又因工資爭議事件繁多，一部份雖由社會局調解，但送請評斷會評議者亦不少，昨日會中決定評議以簡單迅速爲原則。按業分類推定五小組處理。第一組爲田和卿，水祥雲，章永欽。第二組爲劉靖基，周學湘，顧祖繩。第三組爲徐寄廎，范才騤，徐霖。第四組爲夏恩臨，沈鼎，樊振邦。第五組爲沈寶夔，梁永章，趙祖沅。以上三人小組人選，係由勞方資方及評斷會三方面各推一代表組織而成。各業如有糾紛送請評斷，由小組調查實際情形後，參照評議辦法並根據實情擬具評斷意見書提交大會討論。如須急待解決者，可由主任委員常務委員決定辦理，先予施行，再提請大會追認。</p>
<p>解　辦法利弊　另推小組研究</p>
<p>至市商會要求取消評斷會所定之解僱辦法，要求根據工廠法第廿七條辦理一點，大會認爲當初係應實情制定，至今利弊如何，推李劍華，田和卿，嚴鍔聲，水祥雲，劉靖基，夏恩臨，梁，永章等七人組織小組會研究，由李劍華任召集人，將研究結果呈社會部決定。</p>
<p>另本市六大公用事業工人於四月底曾由資方預支每人二十萬元，資方要求每人每月歸還百分之二十即四萬元。昨評斷會決定每月收入在一百萬元以上者，按月歸還百分之二十，月入一百萬元以下者，按月歸還百分之十。又公用事業退職金，並規定逾五百萬元者須打折扣，今職工因鑒於物價高漲，請求顧及實際情形予以修正，此事待今日下午之會議討論。</p>
<p>據與會者談：對當月工資可否依照上月指數發給一點，大會決定原則爲，如確實不能負担，依據工資評讓辦法及過去習慣，由小組評議後，可予斟酌辦理。</p>

<p>關宏達舊情人　李華在青自盡</p>
<p>櫻花樹下盛裝縊死　身上藏有美銷黃金</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十九日電〕上海舞女李華，又名素珍，昨下午搭輪自滬抵靑，即夜在遼寗路忠烈祠櫻花樹下，盛裝自縊。屍體於今晨發現，面貌姣好如生。在身畔檢出男子照片多幀，及小會元寶，金鍊，金　，美金，法幣等約値七八百萬元，並有待發信一封，寄上海康定路武陵村六號黃雲收，但內無信件。此一專程來靑自殺之少婦屍體，轟動全市，旋以身畔有此間中央銀行分行收發主任史永濟及鹽務局職員丁澤霆之照片，乃查出死者曾與影星關宏達同居，現已仳離，流浪各地伴舞，在靑鍾情於丁澤霆。此次來靑，專爲求婚，不料發生變卦，郎心如鐵，是以中夜待徊，情無可寄，出於自殺一途。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者於昨日午夜往訪關宏達，知李華現年廿六歲，爲上海人，與關曾同居六年。在與關同居期內之前年，會與殷秀岺等合組劇團，赴靑演劇，詎好事多磨，在靑因雙方感情發生裂痕，當時由李提出要求，實行分居。嗣後劇團返滬，而李華則留靑，入該地大華舞廳爲舞女。如是經過一年之久，李華又在伴舞期內。結識一劉妙者，終由友誼進而同居。李雖花琶別抱，但對關固未嘗忘情也。故在此期內，每於關之友人間，表示後悔。</p>
<p>今年三月，李華由其友伴送來滬，重與關相會，藕斷絲連、頗思破　重圓，但當時關之心情，深恐過往裂痕，勢難彌補，故表示旣吿仳離，不如從此各奔前程。李華目睹此情，已知覆水難收，遂決心再赴靑島，重操舞業。臨行前，關曾贈以美金八十元，法幣一百萬元，及黃金二兩，以壯行色。不意李於上星期日離滬後，已蓄厭世之念，故甫抵靑島，遂即自縊於忠烈祠之內也。（附圖爲李生前小影）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局副局長兼輸出推廣委員會執執會委員沈熙瑞，於上月廿八日，銜命與國行顧問羅傑士。業務局副局長邵曾華，發華南調查走私情形，並與港穗當局，洽商杜絕辦法，除羅邵兩氏，榮已先期折返外，沈氏復遍歷香港，廣州，澳門，廣門各地，方於日前乘荷輪芝加速卡返滬。承語記者：華南一帶，以：（一）港澳情形特殊，（二）海岸綫迤長，（三）港灣曲折，（四）國內外物價相差甚鉅，致走私之風奇熾。然解決之方，不能端如政治一途。基本辦法，仍須從經濟方面入手。例如以輸出言，至低限度，應研究如何使輸出商品，不致虧本。</p>
<p>據分析華南出口，進口，僑匯三種走私情形，就觀察所得，認爲出口走私價値，不及進口走私價値之鉅。而進口走私價値，則不及僑匯逃避價値之鉅。惟三者相較，尤以僑匯及進口所佔之走私値特鉅。僑匯除逃避香港外，厦門實亦爲逃避僑匯之機樑。</p>
<p>據談：此行洽談經過，香港政府態度，極爲合作。且局勢進展至今，業臻成熟階段。港粵之利害關係，已趨一致。故合作改進港粵經濟之畸形化，已爲共同之需求。最近華南輸入出管理委會，即將正式成立，其目的亦所以擬藉經濟方法，以積極取締走私云。</p>
<p>傳說紛紜·人心振奮　華股漲風猛烈</p>
<p>現遞均以俏利姿態結束</p>
<p>華股昨由盤而突起反動，漲風極爲熾烈、銀行界落手吸納，證券帮之多頭，如虎添翼，一部份大戶出後追進，小股亦發動攻（勞，美亞景福首先揭竿而起，雙雙漲停，局勢改觀，塲內如沸，於是外匯變動，以及股票債券並用等說盛行，臨收均以俏利姿能一結束。</p>
<p>晨開時以報載現行外匯管制政策，有修改之訊，即交見昂尤以景　爲是俏。經紀人代表被召赴京，人心不忐忑，遞交則開低盤。遞永紗開後，二二三號二三一號實到七四〇〇元光景，據面仍洄。一八六號一八五號一七九號一四八號趁低進至七六〇〇元外，一一二號一八三號一三三號一二號儿五號一五七號七六號趁高賣到七五〇〇元內，二二三號二三二號二十四號雖進，三一號三二號一一九號三六號一五三號八五號八九號儿一號再賣，遞永紗乃低至七三三〇元。二二四號二三二號三二號八三號一六三號二四號八九號一九九號七三號六五號二三一號連　買進，十時四十分，又回升至七六〇〇元外。九七號一三〇號趁勢略賣，稍有盤頭，後以傳聞掛牌有變動之訊，美亞景　澆勢　動，局面改觀。新光由九七號，景福由二〇號及九七號，信禾由一五二號，美亞由一四號九七號等、發動攻勢，人心大振。二三一號三六號二二號一四二號二三四號二三二號六儿號二一八號二四號一一七號均進，遞紗漲到七九〇〇元。景　　亞由二三一號等迫漲停有成交。一五二號二一一號七六號五四號乘高脫手，降爲七八〇〇元、一四三號一四八號一九〇號等更賣到七七〇〇元。七六號一四號一五五號一六三號一〇八號一五四號二三一號趁低購納，乃將遞、水紗扳高至七九二〇元。二一五號六九號　高了結，退爲七八〇〇元。此後人心已俏，遞交證金又有股票債券可以通融並用之謠，中絲由二三號掛漲停，九七號一八八號三二號一八六號一八五號一五四號二三一號一九七號八八號三六號六五號奮進，遞永紗漲到八一〇〇元，而以八〇八〇元結束，現交以七八五〇元高價結束。收後喊高至八一五〇元左右。結果較前收計美亞漲停後有回，軋升半成，景福亦然，與華　勤典同漲一成强，新光永紗中法信和永公新華各升一成弱，中絲漲停後有回，軋升一成，五和火景大通榮豐中紡水泥聯華微升，統益量綸升半成，內衣麗安　亞各漲一成，商務國實各跌半成左右。遞交計永公平平，新光　與表亞各升半成張，永紗華　　　倍和各赴一成光景，塲外各老股升降咸微。</p>
<p>統債穩健　外股回漲</p>
<p>公債昨形穩健，統丙晨開七一〇〇元，即吿爭買，漲到八三〇〇元，而後稍平。五五五室五〇三室買進，二三〇室五五一室有供，環境有利，形成求過於供。結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各漲六百元·統丙好起八百元，成交不下六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨證券帮買意殷切，更得北帮及廣帮吸納，求方仍過於供，銀行帮及金業中人略有供給，怡紗晨開六四〇〇〇元。自六三五〇〇元起，步升至七〇〇〇〇元關邊、而後略定。港申電微升爲十四元六，結果鋼業獨漲成半弱，英聯航業怡啤各升一成左右，怡紗會德豐紙業漲半成，電話微降而業廣墾植微升，</p>
<p>食米上落狹隘　青島生油狂跳</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧五千八百餘石，早市貨主索價甚堅，惟店方納胃不强，午時仍居平正，結果粳秈米微升三五千元，川米續有抵申，而江西漢口亦有少數來申，形勢不致過於波動。　麵粉因內地升騰，人心堅挺。洋粉廠粉均見上升三五千元，雜牌粉亦加一二千元，麩皮步砌二三千元。豆餅先漲後回，軋升一二千元。營口餅加五六千元。黃豆去胃異常信俐，續步高翔，再見飛騰萬元，生仁客帮本街競爭購納，轉漲萬元。芝蔴依然挺秀，紅糧隨各物上漲，亦加二三千元。苞米北洋問津，回漲五六千元，蠶豆則來貨湧旺，受主仍稀，節節下降，續跌三五千元。莞豆南洋動而不旺，價形平定。</p>
<p>油市因東北貨來源略减，人心激昂，飛黃騰達。生油奔跳三五萬元，豆油飛升二三萬元，淸油狂漲三四萬元，菜蔴油隨之跟漲二三萬元。</p>
<p>食油近日價格連續飛升，昨前二日，每擔生豆油暴漲達十萬元、攸關民生至鉅。據該業中人談：此次漲風、實由於營口附近，因戰事影響。販滬受阻所致。但本市食油，向以青島來源爲大宗。據油商公會某負責人稱二靑島凈生油前日每擔爲五十萬元，每三五〇市斤另須加吉普桶一只，價爲二十八萬元，平均每擔凈生波連桶價爲五十八萬元。再加運費利息約四萬元，實際成本僅約六十二萬元左右。昨日吉普桶生油創七十萬元新高價，實欠合理云。</p>
<p>中央銀行發表　全國米價統計</p>
<p>中央銀行經濟研究處調查本月份第一週（六月二日至七日）全國各重要都市食米（中等）價格，加以平均統計，各城市中以北平最昂貴，每市石合國幣六八七·五〇〇元，其次爲青島，每市石爲五五五·五五〇元，上海則居第三位，每市石爲四二九·六六七元，其他若西安，每市石三九六·六六七元，南京每市石爲三〇一·六六七元，蘭州每市石爲二八四·一六七元，漢口每市石爲一九四·一六七元，廣州每市石爲一七九·五八三元，成都每市石爲一四六·一六六元，最便宜爲昆明，每市石爲一三七。〇〇〇元，較上海市便宜一倍半之上。</p>
<p>杭州米價大跌</p>
<p>〔中央社杭州十九日電〕杭市食米自米潮後，開放自由買賣以來，雖曾一度隨滬價上漲，突出四十萬關。日來上江貨大量湧到，市塲開價驟吿下瀉，上熱白米每石四十三萬跌至三十四萬，糙米二十二萬七千，暹羅米三十二萬八千。其他各物均下跌，據米行中人談，此乃杭市半年來未有之現象。</p>
<p>布價堅定</p>
<p>昨日棉布晨開市續挺俏，十二磅龍頭細布價在三十七萬二千元有成交，旋以紡建開售白坯龍頭細布，掛牌價三十五萬八千元，籌碼頓見充沛。又以今（二十日）銀錢業結息休假，塲中進取減退，龍頭細布價曾小至三十六萬七八千元，有賣出。時有漢口客帮收購，價得穩站，晨後十二磅各檔細布價比上日尙漲二三千至六七千元，漂布組布去化不弱，其餘各布升降互見。</p>
<p>絲綢喊價提升</p>
<p>昨市人造絲仍形呆定，一二〇號高山有光，終日盤旋在一千九百五六十萬元之間，上午九百五十萬元收盤盤，下午因需明日交款，故喊大十萬元·最後喊九百六十萬元賣出價。一五〇號有光及七五號金爲　半光，喊價亦鮮變動</p>
<p>廠經昨市頗形倘俐，因執貸者類皆不育脫手，以致喊價一致提升。不過五擔交易極稀，昨只做開Ｃ字等級略有疵病者，價二千六百萬元，貸款有七天期頭。另搬需求甚殷，價做二千三百五十萬元起，至四百五十萬元止幾檔，高級另擔喊價二千五百五十萬元。干經市况清淡，行情毫無起色。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨繼續向榮，良以廠絲市價見高，各方紛紛吸收，故行情冉冉上升。大誠備面九百六十五萬元有成交，華強被面先做九百五十萬元，後五十五萬元有賣出。大誠璧縐自三萬五千二三百元升至五千六百元收市，開關期做六千元。人造絲貨需錦綿需求甚殷，上午一萬八千元有交易，下午八千五百元有人肯出。盛貨亦因原料商昂，昨市大起一二萬元不等。杭紡產地報漲，申市昨做燥份一萬三千五百元，比上日大五百元。</p>
<p>棉花交易旺盛</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因到貨稀少，產地存底不多，棉紗漲勢，雖似見稍戢，然脚地甚堅，同時渝漢兩地花價均挺，故人心仍屬看高。本街小型紗廠續有吸胃，客帮在前市未曾扒進表，昨市均有搜購，市上買氣仍濃、交易比上日旺盛。午後做開送廠價，計需寶一六五萬，一七〇萬至一七三萬五千。沙市一六五萬，一六七萬，冲沙市一三〇萬，涇口特　一四五萬，歸德高級一六五萬，漢細一二五萬。又棧交價計白路去一七七萬，靈實一六二萬，一六五萬一六七萬至一七〇萬，沙市一四五萬至一六〇萬，冲沙市一五二萬，漢細二三〇萬，一三五萬，一三六萬五千至一三八萬，一四五萬。歸德棉一三〇萬，涇口特種一五〇萬，通州美種一四〇萬，冲通一一六萬五千，老河口一三六萬五千，一四四萬至一四五萬，涇陽一七二萬，巴西一八七萬，火機一一五萬至一一六萬五千，周浦籽花每組二〇萬至二二萬，各檔成交每件平均統扯比上日軋升十五萬至二十萬元。</p>

<p>紗市長沉微細</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開以染織廠零星採辦，長江帮及業內外人亦有收吸，致價步見上升。嗣因假期關係，浮多吐售，市又微回。結果四二支藍鳳紗價爲一千三百八十萬元，比上日尙好十萬元，二十支特雙馬九百四十五萬元，軋升五萬元。二十支及十六支等粗紗，只好三五萬元，惟三十二支藍鳳及銀月兩檔紗，各降五萬元。</p>

<h3>談小學衛生教材</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>不久前敎育部頒「修正小學課程標準」，雖列有「小學衛生訓練標準」，據說：旨在養成衛生習慣；於是將高小衛生課程取消了，目前硤石各校衛生訓練標準未見實施，衛生課程早已沒有了，全國其他各地學校大概情形不致兩樣？不知這一代兒童，不能繼續求學的，到社會上去怎樣能使他們有正確的衛生觀念，正當的衛生行爲？</p>
<p>敎育事業，爲國族存讀的景　本武器，衛生敎育尤爲一切敎育的空石，因衛生敎育眞正有關國族的盛衰。國家的生命力是：政治，經濟，軍事；而以敎育爲總樞紐敎育分：德，智，體三育，以體育爲空石，但體育不能脫離衛生，不知衛生的體育有害無益，中國古代的六藝敎育，已具備三種敎育，古希臘敎育，注重身體和心智，到中世紀宗敎敎育思潮勃興時，德育才露頭角，才究成三育教育，較諸我國的六藝敎育遲得多，六藝之敎的射御，便是提倡體育的實施方法，從個人訓練起，進而至於養成國防的基本技能；在個人是「文武全才」，在國家「有文事者必有武備」，寓衛國於衛生之中，民二十五年，我國一三九個選手參加柏林世界運動會，全軍慘遭覆沒！抗戰前，首都招考憲兵，百人中僅六個體格完全及格，抗戰時期第十屆——二十屆投考空軍的靑年，以及十次投考軍校的學生，身體及格的不過百分之三十，考空軍及格的，平均不過百分之十左右，而係體育家佔多數，眞够使人猛省！足徵與衛生脫節的體育，終產生不出健全的體格，像這樣的情形，如何能機械化我們的國防？現代化我們的國家？那能成爲名實相符的一等强國？必須全國多數國氏成爲一等體格，方有强國的實力，欲使國民體格爬上水準，必須講究合於衛生的體育，我國四素來不注重衛生敎育，不能促進國　體格達上水準，致死亡率超格，平均壽命降低，影響民族日衰國勢不振！據統計我國日有病人千六百萬人，平均每百人中年死一人；換句話說：全國青年有病人五十八萬四千萬人，病死的四百五十萬人，假定每一病人平均損失斗米代價（包括醫藥費，因病而减少生產的損失費，精神損失，親友探病的川資應酬及其减少生產損失，精神損失，病家侍奉的人的减少其他工夫及精神損失，醫師護士，藥房夥友等醫藥人員的加重負祖損失，消耗國家構藥及營業于查科等的物資損失等等）計五萬八千四百萬石米價。可創醫務機關百所十年，就損失千所，假定每一病死的，平均損失三百石米價（包括前述因病所致的一切可能換失外，再加生活費，特種醫藥喪葬費等）每年共計十三萬萬五千萬石米價，可創大規模工廠百所，以米價每石四十萬元計：五百四十萬億元法幣，照目前財政部長的報吿：每年僅需二十萬億支出，上數足以維持國家財政赤字二十七年，我們能從衛生敎育方面挽救二十七分之一的上述本可補救的損失，目前國家的經濟危機局面，即可扭轉，並不是有蹟。中國抗戰八年，死亡軍民經公佈的，總數不過三百十萬人，但因癆病致死的，去年一年內，估計約達四百五十萬人；然事實上，死亡率每年遞增，一次疫癘的盛行，其損失非數字所能佔計，且國人平均壽命僅三十歲大都於壯年有爲前死去，况三十歲前，能自立的很少，豈非社會白花了養育農，不能爲國家服務，已培養成的專家，因體弱壽短，甚少供獻（偉大的聲明，大都需累積數十年的經騐心得，方有心血結晶的產物，）所以我國缺乏發明家洵國家無限的損失，民族生存上的莫大危機！不到百年，國亡種滅，毋須他人侵略。國父於建國大綱中，規定衛生爲七大建設事業之一，因衛生敎育普及，衛生事業發達，可使民强，生產率高，則國家當可日漸富裕，自能永遠適存於世界上。</p>
<p>國民能從高小中養成良好的衛生習慣，最合理想。因初小兒童的知識，還不够閱讀衛生書籍的能力，衛生常識，不易灌輸。在敎育未普及到中等程度前，高小生已是社會上的　層的中堅份子，高小畢業後，兒童佔絕對多數，不能繼續求學，大都即入社會混飯吃，不從高小中灌輸全部較爲合理的衛生常識以及淺近的醫學知識，國家的前途，依然渺茫！中堅份子在社會具領導的潛在作用，他們依然沒有衛生常識醫學知識，如何能改進社會，破除迷信，普及科學醫藥來配合建國的大業，過去高小衛生敎科書，大都偏重生理解剖，不切實用，洵實浪費。當此敎育部修訂中學課程標準之際，我們覺得高小衛生課程有重應列入的必要！不可拘泥於衛生敎材中不得採入醫學材料，因醫學材料，較偏重文理解剖有意義得多。至小學衛生訓練標準不必廢止，俾多多敎練兒童的衛生觀念衛生行爲，使下一代能爲國家掙氣，中華民國大國幸甚。</p>

<p>在兒童時期，患肺門性結核病的，很屬習見，他的起因，是受着結核桿窗的傳染，吸入的結核桿菌，先在肺臟裏發生初期病寵，再由淋巴　蔓延至肺門部的淋巴腺，發炎的淋巴腺，腫大起來，這便成了肺門性結核病Hilim　tuberculosit。他的症狀，最令人注意的，是來歷不明的發熟，長久地繼着，食慾不振，精神頹唐，運勁後易以疲勞，身體逐漸瘦削。至於咳嗽呢？有的發作，有的不發作，並不一定。對於這症正確的診斷，是要利用結核菌素反應，紅血球沉渣試騐，和Ｘ光檢查，這都是醫師的本分，不屬於常識範圍，姑不贅述。現在且把處理病兒的方法，作簡要的說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）凡常與病兒接近的人，如家庭中的父母祖父母乳媼女僕廚役車夫等，學校裏的敎員和有病的同學們，都是最有嫌疑的人，應當受詳細的探詢和檢查，倘能尋出來源，必須設法與之隔絕，因爲和息結核性的病人，常常接觸，有使病兒轉成重複感染性的危險。</p>
<p>（二）室內的溫度和濕度，必須適當，更須有新鮮的空氣。</p>
<p>（三）患者必須安臥床上，衣服以輕鬆適體爲宜。</p>
<p>（四）飲食必須充足一切必要營養品：如橘汁西紅柿汁白菜水魚肝油，以及其他含有各種維生素的食品，均宜充分供給。</p>
<p>（五）熱度雖已消退，其動作增加，仍須遵照醫師的指導。</p>
<p>（六）在痊癒期內，各種急性傳染病，必須盡力避免，其中最重要的，要算麻疹和百日咳，因爲再患這二種病，可使病勢加重，有時還會引起粟粒形結核病的危險。</p>
<p>總之，肺門性結核病，在病理上說，是屬於初次感染型，是比較容易治愈的，所以患者的家族，對此不必過度悲觀，總要聽從醫師的指導，專心療養纔是。</p>
<p>防設贅言</p>
<p>自古良醫醫未病，病而醫，醫之下者也，當今我國公共衛生落後，冀談醫未病，勢所不能。溯方出醫校之門，家嚴當書座右銘，以爲後學筋勉；謹錄之曰：「知治病而不知防病者爲中醫；旣不知防病之法，而又不知治病之這者爲下醫；不但洞悉病情，按症療治，且能明察病理，而防病於未發之前者爲上醫；吾人縱不能有上醫之實，亦當有爲上醫之志」。不佞問世以來，幾易寒暑，頻職庭訓，不敢自棄，當茲時屆夏令，疫癘將臨，深宵不寐，爰草是篇，聊以償稿債耳。</p>
<p>老子謂：「大軍之後，必有凶年」，蓋以癘氣所鍾之故也。說文謂疫民皆疾也，即同一症而多人罹之，其爲流行傳染性明矣。夫疫之爲疫，其於夏秋令，殆指霍亂。國人之於霍亂，除愚民迷信鬼神作祟外，夙信感土氣而作。因時氣不正所釀，謂爲風木傷土之病。故素問氣交變大論，謂土鬱之發民病，謂爲霍亂以氣解也。禮記謂季春行夏令，則民多疾疫；孟夏行秋令，則其民大疫。今知氣候僅能助長疫菌而已。迨仲景謂霍亂乃因食成，謂驢馬肉合豬肉食之成霍亂，兎肉著乾　食之亦成霍亂，則病原似已歸因於飲食，第不明其所以然也。自一八八三年德人R,Koch氏，在埃及，印度，於病人及屍體，頻經檢究，且更在屍體外，於貯水池內發現菌體，當時飲水者多染病，乃確定是菌爲霍亂本因。其他關於霍亂之症狀經過，似毋庸　在本交中　述矣。</p>
<p>霍亂菌發育適溫約爲攝氏37-40之間，故霍亂於我國流行時季，以夏秋六個月間最盛。我國衛生行政未入正軌，衛生經費結据不數，欲言各項衛生之設施，平日防疫之周備，直若大海投針，擲諸虛牝。益以一般人民衛生常識之缺乏，以致所謂防疫，僅爲大難臨頭，殺到脚邊，臨時之救疫工作而已。如注射疫苗。戒衆愼食，撲滅蒼蠅，是大抵偏重於防禦病原。一知半解者以爲一經預防注射，則可有恃無恐，殊不知預防注射，期效有限，且其作用，僅爲促增對病菌之抵抗力乃防疫之一端，而非全部也。</p>
<p>海上人煙稠密，以言一般住食，殆難盡合乎衛生水準。環境污穢若是，即可隨時發生疾病，其能倖免於疫菌之侵襲者幾稀。然則間有得病不得病，旣病乃有致死不致死之別，此則系乎各人抵抗力强弱之不同。管窺所及，以爲防疫目標，對於防禦病原，固屬金科玉律，而個人攝生，尤屬不可忽視。</p>
<p>（一）飲食忌狂妄：飲食人之大慾，乃維持生活之要素。然而狂飲無量，濫食不節，則不僅擴大胃部內容，廢損消化糸之機能，抑且冲淡胃酸，减少胃液抗菌之效力也。蓋霍亂菌爲嫌酸性，胃酸有制菌性能，故胃液稀薄，足爲霍亂之誘因，此已騐徵於動物試騐報吿。又查各國考求霍亂病例，發生於週末特多，知因暴飲暴食，稀薄胃液之結果，綠是天時　熱，發汗特多，以勞働階層尤多，牛飲解渴，最易稀薄胃液，胃酸冲淡，則减弱抗菌力之一大原因也。</p>
<p>（二）注意寒暑：條悠暑日，氣候之變遷殊甚。晨夕之間，溫度相差懸殊，是以衣食增减，門窗啓閉，宜乎隨時留意。海上房荒，斗室雜居，夏夜不堪酷熱，露宿巷里，往往誘致疾病。俗稱然傷風者，因恃體溫調節機能，先任其勞，久之自然疲憊，乃病矣。冷氣風扇，對於體溫調節機能上最爲憚忌，宜乎審愼。</p>
<p>（三）適當之工作與休息：此與上述第一項間接有關，蓋過度勞作，往往發汗特多，而以大量水份補充之，惟恐稀薄胃酸也。適當之工作與休息，所以增加身體抵抗力，蓋疾病之作，除本因以外，往往無誘因不作，此我儕當可公認？霍亂本因，今旣確知爲霍亂弧形菌菌之傳染，而傳染時恒須與以各種之適當機會及條件，而對於機會及條件上之設防及注意，尤爲防疫聲中之要件。</p>
<p>我國似欲以預防疫苗，獨力完成免疫奇蹟，而防者儘防，病者儀病，如時疫不發生，小民宜乎額手稱慶，一旦發生，則依然焦頭總額。非至秋深，疫勢不止，然則防疫云何，乃爲臨時之救疫而已矣。</p>
<h3>談醫偶得</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>傳染性耳下淋巴腺炎的簡易療法</p>
<p>近來有一種傳染性耳下淋巴腺炎非常盛行。它的症象是：「初起時疲倦，頭痛，耳痛，怕冷，發熱，出汗，倡或鼻部出血。經過一二天後，則耳下兩側（或一邊）腫大起來，面頰腫大，眼臉浮腫，外耳疼痛，聽覺發生障碍，吞嚥亦感困難，咀嚼時覺不易。捫其耳下患處，則有硬塊而感痛楚。本病之經過雖屬良好，但亦需七天至十天方可痊愈。此病之併發症爲中耳炎，丸睪炎或卵巢炎以及腦膜炎等，惟不常見。患者以小孩爲多，成人甚少。但成人若患此症，則易生併發症，熱度亦高，往往有因睾丸炎或卵巢炎而陽隊或不孕者。」</p>
<p>因爲這種傳染性耳下淋巴腺炎的病原菌尙來發明，所以它的治療方法總是退熱劑止痛劑以及各種包敷的治標方法而已。筆者最近曾遇此症甚多，起初除用上述治標方法外曾試用磺胺　唑劑及其類似品。但是結果總不佳良，非等候到十天八天之後不能痊愈。以後我改用灰色水銀軟膏（Ungt　Hycrgyrum　Cinereu-日30％）數在患處，二三天後即行痊愈、累試累騐，絕對可靠。不過富有敖用此水銀霄時每天只能敷一次，每次最多不能超過五小時以免體內吸收水銀太多引起中毒現象。</p>
<p>至於創用灰色水銀軟膏醫治本病的理由，則非常有趣，値得一誌，特此附述如下：吾人鄕間稱此病爲猪頭瘋，以其形似也。若有患之者其父若母輒携之赴蒙館，央老學究用蘸濃厚之銀硬硃於患處畫一圈，圈內寫一虎字，蓋謂虎能食猪也。結果此症於寫有虎字後即行痊愈，甚有效騐。予初不察，以爲偶然之巧合耳。嗣予診餘習畫，研究各種顏色，方知所謂銀硃也者，蓋即水銀之化合物也。查水銀入體之後，往往集合於耳下腺體及口腔內唾腺之內以及大腸之粘膜內。（據藥物學報吿）。且水銀化合物之消毒作用甚强，醫者均已知之。今茲鄕間老學究銀硃筆之能治愈猪頭瘋者，無非因水銀對於此症有特殊之消毒作用耳。予根據上述理由，遂用灰色水銀華膏試用於本病，而其結果竟甚靈效。凡我同道，不妨一試，以資印證。</p>
<h3>百日咳之治標療法</h3>
<p>我們大家都曉得在痙攣期中的百日咳眞是不容易治療。而對於患病的小孩呢，我們看見他上氣接下氣的一連咳嗽幾十聲，甚而至於臉色發紫大有氣閉而死的樣子，眞芷太可憐相了！我們曾經用過許多百日咳漿苗，但是牠只能在起初的粘膜期中有些效用。我們有時也用些麻醉劑，可是牠可以阻塞疾液因而引起可怕肺炎以及呼吸困難等現象。我們有時也用些劑，可是往往因此引起小孩撒昏睡，不但病孩父母非常疑懼，而且往往也聯帶地引紹一種依脫注射劑（ActhercumOleum　Ollvarum　Lcc）。</p>
<p>牠對於百日咳症的咳嗽方而非常靈騐。我曾加以試騐，結果非常滿意。如果在下午或晚上爲百日咳病者注射一針，那末病者在晚上一定可以有較長的安眠時期。此藥德國出品的也有法國出品的也在，中國貨也有。每天注射一次，每次一四西，（成人二西西）肌肉內注射。此藥有一種小缺點，就是注射時甚爲痛楚，不免有二三分鐘內的難受也。</p>

<h3>醫事問答</h3>
<p>— 梁後青醫師主答</p>
<p>你的勇邁前進毫無顧忌的「求生慾」眞是値得我們欽佩的！然而我得老實吿訴你，人到底還是個人，我們無論如何却不能把自己當作試騐品去測騐尙未成功的藥品。假如因爲試用藥物而發生了危及性命的副作用，那你就要懊悔也來不及了。所以我勸你以後千萬不要冒着這樣大的險去嘗試。雖則你說自從服了「使他肺安定」三個月之後，减輕了許多症象，胃口亦已轉佳，但是這個「使他肺安定」的藥到現在還在試騐期中，衛生局且曾禁止發賣，（而且也有許多病者報吿服用此藥的失敗經過）。可見此藥的功效是尙須繼續測騐而不能認爲完善的了。又如我從前曾經提及的大風子油，說它有治喉結核的功效；這不過是一種報吿供給大家參考而已。但是你看了這段消息之後馬上就拿來試用，而且買了中藥裏的大風子研末內服，不管它有沒有戕害身號的毒素以及刺激陽胃的副作用。這種大胆的作風，眞是聞之令人咋舌。</p>
<p>可以使人欽佩的是因爲你的大胆的嘗試或許給予肺結核症的治療方面有一些寶貴的曙光！我在前期的問答欄裏也曾說過：「結核菌和麻瘋菌的性質是很相像的。因爲大風子對於麻　甚有治療功效，所以我和李岡醫師曾經把它試用在喉結核方面（因喉結核是外科性的，用大風子油塗滴患處比較的可以减免它的毒性或副作用），結果認爲甚有效騐，所以把它公開出來，讓病者可以把這種方法去和主治醫師去斟酌症情應用。然而你竟大胆地買了中藥裏的大風子研末拿來內服。幸虧你沒有毒死，而且也還得着它的益處。這眞是一種奇蹟！假使醫藥界能够從此繼續研究而能够得着專治肺癆的特效藥，那你眞是最偉大的冒險者了。</p>
<p>關於攝養方面我以爲你還得好好地紫意的。一切硬性的和不容易消化的食物都在禁用之列。你必須長期的進用容易消化而且富於滋養的食物。維他命ＡＢＣ三種更加不可缺少。如果事實上做得到，不妨大量的注射葡萄糖鈣和維他命Ｃ及Ｂ之類。若能照此長期地療治而又加以長期的靜臥，那末你的病是可以痊癒的。</p>
<p>末了，我得附帶地告訴讀者一聲；「葉解無君所述的病情和我所提供的療治辦法只不過供給大家作一種參考的資料而已，　望大家千萬不要隨便盲從才好！」　至於你所說的內服「斯突立脫美新」一則，我認爲是錯誤的因爲它作爲內服劑後就完全失去了效　了，那又何必花了這麽許多錢（每瓶約値法幣四十餘萬元）去做毫無效用的事呢？（續完）</p>

<h3>給達豐輪中羅難的玠</h3>
<p>— 徐訓</p>
<p>玠：今天距你離家的那天已有六天了。這在我們，是多學長的日子啊！想到你，我只有哭。</p>
<p>玠，萬想不到我們婚後的第一次分別就是永訣。你不是說過，最多三天就回來。然而六天了，還不見你。今天依舊凄風苦雨，你，飄流在哪兒呢？</p>
<p>前兩天，當我迷惘的時候，我常常以爲你會回來的。我想像你已經隨波逐浪飄到一個沙灘上，一個慈祥的老漁翁把你救起。有一天，你會穿着不稱身的衣服，突然在門口出現。於是，當門外的脚步聲一響，我就以爲是你來了。雖然我辨得出這不是你的，却禁不住抬起頭望出去，雖然望出去是空空的。</p>
<p>這幾天來，到處得不到你的消息。玠，我沒有勇氣期望你生還了。別人還以『也許被帆船救去』來勸慰我，這哪兒有千萬分之一的希望？你不會游泳，你體格不强，即使有了一塊木板，也不可能支持多久。何况，雖然年靑，但對於生和死看得那樣淡泊的你，可能就不作絕望的掙扎。你又精細，如果你已隨帆船安達另一個地方，即使你暫時不回來，信一定早就來了</p>
<p>由於乘怕了航利，你才乘了達豐。誰知它的年齡已數倍於你的，它的機器早已陳舊，船身早已屬朽，早就該停止航行了。而且當永漳油輪施救前發旗語時，船員中竟沒有人能懂得，這樣的船還可航行？玠，你是無辜的。航政的竄敗，奸商的牟利，才使你們寃沈江底。逃出的旅客說，許多人根本就被關閉在艙裏，沒有機會求生。如今，南通旅滬同鄕會已起來主持正義，妥謀善後了。玠，你瞑目吧，不久，你們的寃屈一定可以大白的。假如你們不能够伸寃，那以後繼續受難的，將是千千萬萬的人。</p>
<p>爲了回去看你爸爸的病，你才急急地走了。八號中午，你還未作歸計，等你去二姐家知道老人家病重的消息後，便立刻買了藥，決定回來辭行了。爲了趕上當夜的輪船，你走得那樣匆促。我泡杯茶給你，你甚至於等不及它凉，就帶了衣服走了。你怕我累，不要我送下樓。我送你到了門口，想再送你上碼頭，你却不要。你不是第一次往來大江南北，我便很放心地讓你獨自走了。在門口，看着你的背影在弄口消失，我便轉身上樓，安然睡去。夜半，暴風雨驚醒了我，我只想想你的衣服穿得很單薄，明天要着凉了。九號淸早，風雨更急，七點多，我在赴校的路上想：你不好在任港上岸，一定要去天生港了。我躭心你的身體是否會着凉生病，即刻寫信到南通，誰知你已永久看不到了呢？</p>
<p>你上船已十時多，據說那時外灘的風勢已經很大。你歸心似箭，堅決地走了。現在，我只恨我沒有送你。平時，我關心你每一件細微的事，而這次卻這樣粗心疏忽。如果我送你到碼頭，見風勢險惡，江上浪大，一定會留住你。是我讓你獨自走去，以致橫遭不測。玠，我將終身含恨，也沒法來向你求恕。</p>
<p>玠，你是那樣孝順年邁的爸爸。那年，他老人家給僞軍抓去，你去代替他出來。平日，爸爸有了小病，你便寢食不安，何况這下子他病重了。你又是那樣歡喜小孩子，難怪你的姪兒外甥都喜愛你。每次，你一到二姐家，首先就是抱她的小上海。三個月以前，我們一道回南通，帶着許多東西。你留心胎兒的安全，上下碼頭時，不但勉力自已拿着，還　了我，囑咐我走好。我出去乘電車，你都說：要當心，人擠就別埀。我做事累了，你便問：身體舒脹嗎？你的心裏，充滿着做爸爸的喜悅。哪兒想到，等孩子出世時，已看不見愛他的爸爸了。也有人因此爲我難過，我部慶幸你留下你一點紀念。你臨行時還說：「放了學早些回來，不要軋電車，把孩子帶好』。說到最後一句，我們都笑了。誰又想到笑話竟成議語，且是你僅有的遺囑了。如今，最使你惦記的，仍是你的爸爸和孩子。我當像你一樣侍奉爸爸，他要的藥，昨天又買回去了。我也當盡我的心力來敎養這將出世的孩子，以安慰你－爲爺爺而遭不幸的爸爸。我們曾想給他取個好名字，現在，不管音調怎樣，我想就給他命名「六九」。一方面紀念他爺爺今年的六十九歲，也紀念你愛難的日子，六月九日！</p>
<p>玠，眞想不到我們生離得這樣慘，死別得這樣快！凡是認識我們的人都覺傷心，連我的學生們也流淚。我們也曾理想過有一夭祝賀我們的銀婚和金婚紀念日，誰知只共處了九個月。在婚夕，你塡的詞上還說：「征途漫漫，同把槳舵自今天」。誰知我們共同生活之舟還不到半途，便讓我獨航了。本來人的生和死算一回什麽事，尤其在這年代，更是何等尋常？只是你太年靑，你只二十三歲；你還有一年交大就畢業，所學竟不能致用。－而且你去得太突兀，太悲慘了。我疑惑自已在做夢，我不相信像你這樣正直純良的人會給江浪吞沒的。</p>
<p>玠，這幾天你回家看過我了吧？但我卻沒有住回去。我不忍看家中的任何東西，每一件上都有着深切的回憶，我一看到，眼淚就湧出來了。</p>
<p>哥哥和姐夫成天在奔走，我已沒有勇氣和力量了。玠，我只求早日尋着你，讓我再一次看見你的面目，讓我匍伏在你身旁，痛哭一塲，並且將你安頓在一個可以長眠的地方。—以後，我只有設想你是個遠行的旅人，飄泊在不知名的異鄕。咫尺天涯，願我們在我夢裏相見，在我死後重逢。繼這信之後，我將一直給信你，來寄託我無可寄託的情意，來安慰你孤寂的心。</p>
<p>前天在二姐家發現你的一部分書籍文稿和信件，以前散失了不以爲意，如今卻是可珍貴的了。等我心緒好一點，把它們連同家裏的一道整理起來。玠，你的靈魂將伴着這些而長在，你將永遠活在我的心底，活在許多親友的心頭的。再談了，玠。（六月十四日）</p>
<h3>白色的交響由</h3>
<p>— 回斯萊</p>
<p>回斯萊（J.Whistler　1834-1903）並不是眞正的英國籍的畫家。因爲寄居在英國，所以史家把他列入了英國畫史。　　他一生憧憬東方，作風頗富東方情趣，色彩有音樂的效果。畫題亦多取音樂術語·即如此圖，一個白衣女郎倚在白石壁爐架上，他就命名爲「白色的交響曲」。除此尙有代表作一灰與黑的支配」（即母親像），「靑與金的夜曲」……等。這些作品在當時受盡了譏駡和嘲笑、但今日都成爲世界名作而被珍藏在英國皇家美術館了。劉獅</p>
<h3>獻</h3>
<p>— 默沁</p>
<p>蔦　又一次閃着血紅的花朶時，您已離世整整一年了。</p>
<p>幾枝您生前愛好的游龍草，數束鮮花，更有一瓣心香都帶來您的墓前，這是現在我所能爲您做的一切了。</p>
<p>您讓別人葬埋了，可是爲什麽不把我的思念帶了去？您的聲音笑貌時常這樣深沉地鑽刺着我的記憶，我不會忘却這些生命的和聲。是的，我知道生前您曾因我而有所不快，但明理如您，聰慧如您想必懂得我的衷心；假使您沒有如我這樣設想的話，讓我在這裏再度表明自已吧。</p>
<p>我始終沒有活得長久的願望，涉世不過廿多年，但人間的陰冷早已寒透了我的心，所謂幸福僅僅是將雨時天空的雲片；這些雲片的顯現只是風雨來臨的預示，等風雨一過，它們便消散了。在抓得幸福後的笑容還未收歛時却已將爲滅亡而哭泣，何必讓人事戲弄我們的情感？有限的喜悅乃無限的悲哀之泉源。所以，我不要別人關進我的生活圈，有什麽苦痛，讓我獨自吞下不更好嗎？生命祗是一種債務，消磨盡一堆歲月，熬受完各樣古難，才可得到安息。我旣不能製造別人的幸福，有什麼理由呌別人分担我的苦痛。您說您能使我幸福，我當然信任您；可是，我不信任『幸福』本身。爲了避免日後的苦惱，還是讓幸福永生在幻想裏；所以我沒有接受您的意思。在我默然接觸到您疑慮而譴責的目光時，我心裏是如何難受，不必用言語解釋了。讓時間作我的證人吧，誰料，誰料　却活得比我更短促，您終究等不及我的剖白了！</p>
<p>當您結束學程赴內地的時候，在輪埠上，對您陰鬱的臉色，我說了很多話：「胸襟要開朗一點，感情不必太狹隘；太狹隘的情感只會引起痛苦，把人生看得認眞並不是聰明的事；換一個目標，換一條路走，或多或少會使您串福一點。抬起頭來，給一個明朗的笑吧！我們永遠永遠是好朋友。』您果然揮着手巾笑了，我勉强放下心跟着您笑，想不到這是最末一次的笑，而且這笑還將化成淚水。</p>
<p>一路您吿訴了許多沿途的情形，還省的奇風異俗，以輕鬆的筆調寫下來。這是我的安慰，我像被赦了罪刑一般地平安，喜悅。您抵達了山城，您有了不壞的職業；自然，那邊有您有地位的父親，您的路不至過份崎嶇。您說您常常打撲克，在俱樂部裏玩通宵；您也參加派對，您喝酒，又抽香烟。我眞担心您的飲康；而且這些行爲與您喜愛游龍草的性格是相遠了。我多麽願望您能保持素昔那種無華的樸實。</p>
<p>我盼望您生活得規則，我盼望您好好走自已的路，我更盼望您尋一個同路者，開拓滿意的生活環境。我盼望盼望，可是千種盼望都落了空！您回來了，回來的是個沒有靈魂的軀體。得到您父親爲您設奠的消息，我沒有勇氣前來致祭，我忍心看您父親的白髮與母親的淚眼？您妹妹也投我以幽怨的眼神。當然，我絲毫不怪她，她不會懂得我的初衷，兄妹之情總是勝過同學的情份的；一看到她臂上的黑紗，我總痛苦地低下了頭。爲了避免未來的不幸，反造成了更深的創痛，我讓我所保持的情感毀了您的生命。早知如此，我就不該太自私，您呌我怎樣洗去內心這份歉疚？</p>
<p>開元寺裏的棠棣花又一度盛開了，滄浪亭的新荷已透了水。然而，這裏不再有我們的遊踪，我的靑春的顏笑已消褪了顏色，爲了對您的贖罪我是甘領忍受各種懲罰的。</p>
<p>活著您並不孤單，死後您不是的；生命還須以生命償付。那麼，再給我一個明朗的笑吧！（卅五年六月）</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>
<p>— 陳培</p>
<p>屋裏開始昏暗起來，停了筆對着窗外兀自凝神。</p>
<p>多少日子，在那烟波江上，淡淡的新月襯着藍天，朦朧罩着遠山，水在流，風在唱，船在做着無聲的夢……我！流浪的人，度過幾度黃昏。</p>
<p>曾幾何時，又拋開了那份水上生涯，伴着一枝筆，幾張紙，讓黃昏挾着寂寞，嚙着一顆慘澹的心。</p>
<p>懷想</p>
<p>在黃昏的燈下，對着一朶枯　的碧桃花，展開了我的懷想。</p>
<p>我是從遼遠的嘉陵江畔把它帶來的，如今兩年了，我還保存着它。</p>
<p>它給我帶來了一串深灰的日子，也給我帶來了白畫的勞碌，更給我帶來了不少的詩篇，在這整整兩年中。</p>
<p>有的時候，它還可讓我思想的燈光，照一照我那美麗的姑娘，想一想那初升的月亮，寄一寄遼遠的懷想。</p>
<p>牛</p>
<p>我夢到：我變成一條牛，</p>
<p>吃力地奔跑，呼呼地喘氣，　在背上，汗在臉上，直到我死。</p>
<p>醒了！我想：支配人者和被人支配者，白畫的夢與夜晚的夢，都是一樣。</p>
<p>人生原是一條耕耘生活的牛！啊</p>
<h3>音樂語錄</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>音樂是唯一富有生命的活藝術。（Paderewski）</p>
<p>音樂是最有效的工具之一，用以左右人的理智和精神。（Gladstone）</p>
<h3>唐代的歌舞女</h3>
<p>— 董每戡</p>
<p>李唐承前朝的歌舞，製了許多新曲，戲劇中的樂歌部份到這一代愈增完備。因爲唐高祖武德初因隋舊制用九部樂，後又在禁中設置敎坊，專掌敎育音樂及典倡優。太宗浩燕樂十部，聲辭趨於繁雜，其著錄十四調，二百二十二曲。玄宗開元二年，這位好音樂的皇上，又置敎坊於蓬萊宮側，京都設在左右兩敎坊，分樂爲坐立二部，立部伎八，坐部伎六，敎坊之制一直到滿淸雍正間才廢。此外，玄宗又設梨園敎授優人和伶人以小部歌樂十一曲，雲韶樂二十曲。</p>
<p>玄宗不止好音樂而予以提倡，並且自己便是位音樂家，宋王讜之「唐語林說」。</p>
<p>「玄宗洞曉音律絲管，皆造其妙，制作諸曲，隨意即成，如不加意；尤愛羯歧，橫笛，云八音之領袖諸樂不可與比……」</p>
<p>所以他非那些只因自己愛娛樂而獎勵歌舞的帝王可比。當時和此有關的措施頗多，其中自然以置敎坊，梨園爲最重要。唐初，凡雅俗諸樂都隸屬於堂宗廟儀儀的太常；到了開元二年，玄宗以太常爲禮樂司，比蛟是嚴肅些的官署，不應典倡優。因之更置左右兩敎坊，於蓬萊宮側，而兩者各有專長。</p>
<p>唐崔令卿敎坊記：「西京右敎坊在光宅坊，左敎坊在延政坊，右多善歌，左多工舞，蓋相因習……」</p>
<p>由這番話推測當時的坊敎情形，當是一邊專敎歌，一邊專敎舞，敎坊中大致以初學所謂「揔彈家」居多，似乎梨園就有點綜合敎授的性質。敎坊梨園固然爲一是二，二是一的同一東西；但或許有初級高級之分。如這猜測沒有錯，我以爲敎坊是初級的，敎授一般宮人以普通的歌舞技能；而梨園是高級的，集中一些已有專長或一些素質特佳的宮人，並且玄宗親自敎授。敎坊女樂升了等，方被稱爲梨園子弟罷？觀唐書禮樂志所載，似乎含有此種意味，該書云；</p>
<p>「明皇旣知音律，又酷愛法曲，選坐部伎子弟三百敎於梨園，聲有誤者，帝必覺得正之，號皇帝梨園弟子，宮女數百，亦稱梨園弟子，居宜春院梨園。」</p>
<p>同書又云：「開元十一年，初製聖壽樂，令諸女衣五方色衣以歌舞之，宜春院女敎一日，便堪上塲，惟揔彈家彌月不成，至戲日，上令宜春院人爲首尾，揔彈家在行問，令學其舉手也……」</p>
<p>由這裏可窺見揔彈家和梨園子弟有工拙之別，我以爲也就是敎坊和梨園的等級之分。當時所歌舞的樂曲甚多，固不能確如白居易所誇張的「千歌萬舞不可數」那樣多得難以置信，「唐六典」及「文獻通考」便記載了五十有餘曲，因之，每次呈演必先進曲名備點，爲了過多，不能一一畢演。「敎坊記」說：</p>
<p>「凡歌出戲，所司先進曲名，上以墨點者即舞，不點即否，調之進點日。內伎出舞，敎坊人惟得舞伊州五天重來疊，不離此兩曲，餘盡讓內人也。」（同書云：「妓女入宜春院，謂之「內人」，亦曰：「前頭人」，常在前也。」</p>
<p>且當時的歌舞規模亦甚大，多者有用九百人，少者亦用百四十人。舊唐醫音樂志曾云：『長壽二年正月則天親享萬象神宮，先是，上自製神宮大樂，舞用九百人，至是舞於神宮之庭。』又云：『聖壽樂高宗武后所作也，舞者百四十人。』用這樣多的人，在天寶前實不能算多，杜甫說：「先帝侍女八工人，」白居易說：『後宮佳麗三千人，』新唐書還說大概有四萬人。那末，至少有白說的那個數目，在幾千佳麗選用近千人，還可以算是精選出來的呢。</p>

<h3>被忘了的島嶼－琉球</h3>
<p>— 亞譯</p>
<p>日本投降後，全國曾有「歸還琉球」的呼聲，琉球，的確是我國東面的圍牆，日本的侵略，不是先跳進這這圍牆，再窺視破入的？美軍在冲繩不是化了三萬五千人死傷的代價？牠的重要，可想而知。最近據說日本有要求與美共管該羣島的消息，國人聞之，莫不髮指。琉球的地位，尙待決定中，我們對這離開祖國懷抱六七十年的琉球，不兔上了一層隔膜，本國記者又很少去採訪報道，因此略作介紹：</p>
<p>二年前美軍在冲繩南部的血戰，至今猶一片殘跡，在那霸（NABA），昔日有六萬五千人，對外貿易，尙稱發達，如今亦瓦礫通地，有二條軍用公路與島上美軍駐地相聯接。</p>
<p>北部山地中，相信仍有很多小數零星的日軍隱匿着，冒險的踏入古基，殘壁，或其他危險的地方，往往會被日人的地雷或陷穽害死。</p>
<p>有組織的日軍，經八十二天的血戰，至一九四五年六月一十一日才撲滅，是役美軍死一萬五千人，傷二萬餘人，死的包括美第十軍司令貝克納將軍，及一個從軍記者貝爾。</p>
<p>二年以來，沒有一所較好的房十建起，美軍所住的不過暫時性的小屋，千百的土人則是不堪人居的茅屋；食的只靠美國以前運來的一批食物，因爲肥料，漁船及其他設備都感到缺乏。</p>
<p>決定該島命運的華盛頓官員現在正注意着歐洲的情况。</p>
<p>「戰後的冲繩是被遣忘了。」一個當地美國首領吿訴記者，「當一個高級官員偶然從華盛頓飛到東京或上海經過此地，他或者會說冲繩對美國沒有戰略上的價直，但是意料不到的，他沒有什麼表示。」</p>
<p>美國軍事首領不願作公開表示，但這是很明顯的，他們莫不希望能早日將該島地位的澄淸及美國所定計劃宣佈。當地政府已極其所能，但因受資金缺乏，職權限制，故成效並不大：幾條珊瑚質的路已條築完成；戰時的機塲，在改良擴大中，並且已有許多木屋供給准許來此的美人家屬</p>
<p>島上最光榮的地方，亦就是忙於遊歷的記者，所不能訪問的，就是那五座烈士的大墳基，那純潔的地方，更顯出他們勇敢，壯烈，大多數忠魂，將永眠異鄉，島上的駐軍，亦可以自傲以守此忠骸。</p>
<p>「此輩烈士永遠的向着我們控訴，那是最同情的控訴。」一個老軍官對我說：「我們覺得大多數的健兒們，他們有靈魂的話，一定以爲此地是最好的地方，並且我們斷定此地將成爲一個美國永久的聖地。」</p>
<h3>陽關的冒險　——哈薩故事之三</h3>
<p>— 朴園</p>
<p>哈薩是回敎徒，不知爲甚麼，同內地的回敎徒，好像有着深仇大恨，不碰則已，一碰到就殺！</p>
<p>民國卅一年，藝專校友雷雨辰君，同着西北文物考察團到了敦皇，因爲考察的關係，想到陽關附近去，敦皇縣長說；「不行罷？那裏有哈薩族！」雷君，或許除了爲西北文物冒險以外，也許正想爲邊疆民族冒冒險，一定要去，縣長沒辦法，派了四個武裝警察，同一個學測量的屬員同去。</p>
<p>「果然」，雷君張大了眼睛說，好像從遠處看到哈薩來了似的，「我們　到了不久，心裏正想笑，笑　　　故意張大其辭，我們不是來了嗎？哪兒呢？哪兒有哈薩呢？」嘿，有誰呌了一聲，呌得好怕人，說是哈薩來了，拍，拍，拍……我還沒來得及看，同我們來的警察就開了槍，而且，已經有一個受了傷，一個死了！</p>
<p>「這時侯，我仿彿也看到，後頭有三四匹馬，馬上坐着頭上插鳥毛的人，不成問題，這眞是哈薩啦！警察還同他們打，我們就跑！跑哇，跑哇，跑得上氣接不着下氣兒，停都沒停，四個警察都死光，三匹哈薩的馬已經趕上來！拍，拍，拍，後面直打搶，我想：完了，這次無論如何沒命了！」</p>
<p>「幸虧，我只懂得一句哈讀話！看看已經給他們追上，那位學測量的人給他們打倒，我就不管三七二十一，把手一舉，用哈薩話說：「我是漢人！」也不知是這一句話的效果，還是我那個同伴所揹的那照像機引誘了他們的眼，我仿彿看到他們下了馬，一齊走向那同伴兒，我就不顧死活，一溜烟，跑掉了！」</p>
<p>雷先生說完就長長的吐了一口氣，仿彿那三個哈薩剛剛跑開似的。</p>
<p>這些故事，使我相信：哈薩，有一副愚笨的，醜的外貌，却有一副聰明的，美的靈魂；假使能好好地給予敎育，他們會有他們的黃金時代。</p>
<h3>小教生涯</h3>
<p>— 涵光</p>
<p>六月三日讀某報壽縣通信，壽縣中學國文敎員孫堅如的一副聯語「哄鬼文章，騙人事業；呌街技術，討飯生涯。」不禁感從中來；爰拈此題，以寫瑣事。</p>
<p>筆者現在蘇北某鎭做小學敎師，自開學迄今，已逾四月，僅領得五萬元及米兩石八斗。家中一妻一子，開門七件事，缺一不可。　中久已無米，專恃借債度日，借之不得，只得變賣用物。前天，與妻商量再三，忍痛將我們結婚的紀念物：一面好鏡子，兩張新椅子，廉價出售，共得四萬八千元。昨天，買了二十多斤柴草，一斗元麥，已用去一半；其餘的，眼看馬上就要用光。倘再要賣，祇有一隻放衣裳的皮箱了。但是，能値幾何？又能支持幾天？</p>
<h3>人口過𠝍</h3>
<p>— 但蒙</p>
<p>馬爾薩斯所闡述的人口問題，一般以爲已探到了人類的秘密。可是他的結論却是很悲觀的，並且這不僅是暫時的悲觀，而是永極的悲觀，替整個人類的命運和歸宿，說出了最無抗拒的苦悶。從能立說以後，各民族間便植下了恐怖的陰影，心理上始終不能寬懈，同時祖繼的戰爭和飢饉又似乎是證明。這是半世紀以來，人們所徘徊而不敢全然否認的一件使智藝　及力量覺得無功無能的事實。</p>
<p>中國的地大物博，在今日已在比較上减色了，唯一仍舊可以誇耀的，只是人衆，人衆，令人想起天才的馬爾薩斯和憂慮的馬爾薩斯學說。</p>
<p>在我們眼前，一速串使人不愉快的景像爆發着，蔓延着。失業，流離，自殺，甚至於屋荒，物價，等等的問題，大多數人皆以爲是人口的數量上已有了嚴重的疾害。從不可計數的症象中有人認爲，除了馬氏的解釋，似乎把握到了我們這圈子裏的癥結外，很難找出別的理由。</p>
<p>於是山額夫人的信徒或心儀者又將悲天憫人地向善男女呼簾了，提倡節育，說這是顧憐第二代的必要措施。可是在這困難的環境裏，除了已飽暖舒妥的少數人還能增殖他們「優秀的」子女外，多數人怕大多已將生育認爲是生活中最堪驚懼的不幸了。中國的溺嬰綠棄嬰率和墮胎率依然是高高的。</p>
<p>此外，譬如從不久前的各地搶米事件看來，難免使我們不疑惑究竟是人口過剩了，抑是人口與食糧隔絕了，才產生這些悲劇。華麗的花園大厦，只住一家人和他們的傭僕，貧民穵裏每人只有三四方公尺的地盤；商店中國儲的貨物，或衣服等生活資料缺欠銷塲，可是沒有什器應用，甚至於半裸着軀體的　婦孩童却充斥在街頭。是人口過剩？中國的人口密度並不高於某富足的國度。</p>
<p>抵抗馬爾薩斯學說的是「互助論」，樂觀而給人類以希望，更給人以應循的將綫之合作。我們如再以人口過剩爲藉口，而容許各不公平的罪惡持繼下去，那是可恥的，並且這也不就是人類免除責任的理由。我們應說，人口並不過剩，不過人口的互助精神未曾儘量發揮而已；馬爾薩斯，人類醜行的辯護人，不許介紹他的謬說到我們這已在不幸着的圈子算來！</p>

<h3>新欽差大臣　談廣東梅縣的趣劇</h3>
<p>— 東流</p>
<p>果戈里寫作「欽差大臣」時，當然是有所依據的，這部諷刺劇暴露了十九世紀帝俄官塲的眞相，其效果或不下於中國的「官塲現形記」，拿果戈里的寫實手法來和李伯元比較，自然有點擬於不倫，但兩者間的態度倒有點相似：同是在笑罵中懷有一腔悲憤。</p>
<p>在中國現實社會中，近來時常發生類似「欽差大臣」的趣劇。一個剃頭匠之流的人，財迷心竅，異想天開，竟邀了幾個茶房，泥水匠到蘇北去冒充「專員」，這新聞在去年是轟動一時的。杭州也有一個鹽務局的革職人員，借了某廳長的名片，到處招謠撞騙，說他自己即將當某縣縣長了，有誰願出多少錢，他就可委之以「科長」「主任」之類的官職，手頭還有名流沈鈞儒的介紹信，談吐亦頗文雅，因此上當的人頗不少。類似的新聞一登出，報上的標題總於「「新欽差大臣」出現』，足見果戈里的諷剌劇，在中國知識份子是非常熟悉的</p>
<p>最近，大公報廣州通訊員又提供了一個有關「新欽差大臣」的故事，事雖平凡，但也極有典型意味。原來有一個呌張學宏的，本是廣東省府人事科卸任科員，不久前帶了兩個時裝少女抵達梅城，自稱係省府人事處視察。當地縣參議長楊幼敏正欲藉機控梅縣縣長、乃大擺筵席，邀當地耆紳作陪、宴畢即面交密函託張「視察」轉陳羅卓英主席，並餽贈路費，詎料縣府亦已聞悉省視察蒞縣，不免急作一番新佈置，凖備招待，要不是有人發覺該張「視察」所帶之二少女原係興寗縣著名土娼，我們的「視察大人」看來委實還有好多天淸福可事呢。無奈丑角只宜於扮五角，事情拆穿，「視察大人」就只好瑯璫入獄了。</p>
<p>寫實的諷刺劇，雖以現實的故事爲依據，然仍有誇張，有强調，有針砭，不過在藝術巨匠筆下，這誇張與强調不爲一般人所覺察罷了，事實上，在果戈里眼里，梅縣的「張視察大人」便是一個極有風趣的人物，他已以他的現身說法，莫名其妙地揭穿了流行於中國的官僚主義的秘密。</p>
<p>奇怪的不僅是「視察大人」的率妓裝腔，而是那位楊議長何以要「大擺筵席」，甚至「餽贈路費」？如果梅縣縣長確有不法行爲，以議長之尊，儘可遵循司法手續，提出控訴；如果單是爲了一點私隙，則議長的筵席和路費，不會成爲人們的口實麽？另一方面，梅縣縣長不在爲政方面着手，一聞「視察」到來，却「急作一番新佈置，準備招待」，也可以說已深中官僚主義的毒了。在這段報導中，地位最尷尬的是興寗縣的兩土娼，最感新奇的也是這兩個土娼。試想最初她們是如何崇敬官塲。等到發覺官塲中還有這樣的糊塗事，她們豈不將由「驚詫」轉爲　夷的一笑麽？</p>

<h3>玻璃樂哭</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>顯而易見此地所稱玻璃，就是近年來風行全世界的那種可塑體製成的東西。因爲多數透明如玻，所以我們就稱之爲玻璃了。有人認爲把可塑體稱爲玻璃，未免有點「壽」氣。其實這個名稱倒也不是國人特創，連最時髦的美國人自己也有這個稱呼。</p>
<p>且說在一九三九年有一個鋼鋼家兼樂隊領班名呌碧藍玻璃（Billy　Glass）的人，去參觀紐約的世界博覽會。在「玻璃宮」中，那些水晶的製品使他贊嘆不止。因此他忽生一念，如果有一個管絃樂隊，其中的樂器盡是玻璃製造，而由一個名呌玻璃的音樂家來指揮，這該是多麼有趣的事，他夢想着一個「碧藍玻璃的玻璃交嚮樂隊」，去拜訪那些可塑體製造廠家和樂器公司，希望他們能製造這一種樂器，結果却被他們看作荒唐可笑，不予理會。</p>
<p>可是玻璃先生却百折不撓，他自己置了許多玻璃原料，躱在廚房裏開始製造。他以二五十的高熱度，造出了第一把小提琴。這玻璃提琴的聲音與木製的不相上下，它的缺點是音量似欠豐富而已。此後他又製造了五把小提琴，以及其他吉他，小喇叭，鼓，等等的樂器。好萊塢跟製造廠家對於這些玻璃樂器開始發生興趣，然而要這些樂器流行起來而代替木製的司脫萊迭伐里斯提琴，恐怕還需要相當的時日和改良呢。</p>

<p>後來幾口水緋緋是喝下去的，這才使老祝稍稍緩過了一口氣。</p>
<p>他定神想了一想：據那個年老的鄉人說，從關西到南丹走這條捷徑祇有二十四里，即使加一些，作爲三十里算，那末現在他至少已走掉了一半，如果走得快一些，還有一半大概在三小時以內也可以走完了。照稱緋緋現在的病情看，實在有儘早趕到南丹的必要。於是他毫不躊踟地站起身來，先把箱子裏比較値錢而又必需的小東西逐一檢出來，胡亂塞在自已衣褲上的每一個口袋裏，所剩下的東西和那口皮箱他決意不要了，因爲他不敢再讓緋緋　在自己背上，準備就這樣雙手托着她「路走下去、</p>
<p>他像一個被殺敗的戰士一樣的狼狽地在土路上奔馳着，一面還得時時低下頭去，注意他懷裏的緋緋。</p>
<p>緋緋倒又像睡熟了，老祝輕輕地打她手裏取下了那頭銅製的雄免，他怕這樣沉甸甸的一件東西會壓壞緋緋的心臟。</p>
<p>他藏起了鋼兔，竭力振作精神，一步緊一步的走着；汗淌遍了全身，他不時騰出一條右手，從衣袋或褲袋裏隨便抽出一件東西來，——也許是汗衫，或者竟是　子，他也無暇分辦了。——胡亂望臉上和頭頸裏揩擦着。</p>

<h3>Economic Crisis Looms: Premier Zhang Proposes Reform Plan, to be Discussed at Today's State Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Premier Zhang Qun's economic reform plan is scheduled to be presented for discussion at the fifth State Council meeting on the morning of the 20th. This proposal is of utmost importance to the future economic development of our country. The contents are detailed, divided into three major parts: "Explanation," "Economic Reform Plan," and "General Review of Economic Reform." The plan lists fifteen major current issues: (1) Unleashing manpower and increasing production; (2) Increasing material production and stabilizing prices; (3) Stabilizing currency value; (4) Reforming the financial system; (5) Agriculture; (6) Industry; (7) Commerce; (8) Transportation; (9) Finance; (10) Grain administration; (11) Guiding idle capital into the right track; (12) Absorbing foreign capital and strengthening production and construction; (13) Reasonably resolving the compensation of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers; (14) Severely punishing acts of using political power to facilitate private enterprises; (15) Improving economic organizations and explaining reform methods one by one. The full text of Zhang's proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Motion) Propose an economic reform plan for public decision.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Our country is inherently poor and has suffered the destruction of a long-term war. Both manpower and material resources are extremely depleted, and the psychology and skills of most intellectuals cannot adapt to the great era of scientific production. Those who should participate are powerless to initiate, and those who should reform are afraid of reform. Continuing the old ways, poverty increases. Assessing today's economy, it is truly facing a serious crisis and urgently needs a specific remedy to determine a reform plan. This proposal is based on the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood and its principles of socialization, defining the future direction for handling all economic issues. With national capital as the center, leading the activity of private capital, taking on difficult national enterprises, and supporting easy private enterprises. All measures related to finance, economy, and finance should focus on the long-term interests of the country. Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan respectfully presents the economic reform plan.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Prices and Currency Value: Public and Private Banks Must be Distributed Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>[Attachment 1]: Unleashing manpower and increasing production. (1) Protect existing production businesses as much as possible to stabilize employment and prevent unemployment. (2) With an effective plan, gradually increase new production and construction businesses, guiding idle manpower to participate in production. (3) Encourage scientific invention, promote labor service, to change the ethos and encourage the spirit of creative enterprise. (4) Coordinate planned education with planned economy, so that talent cultivation and production construction are integrated.</p>
<p>2. Increasing Material Production and Stabilizing Prices. (1) The government must promote the production of major agricultural raw materials such as rice, wheat, cotton, and beans through agricultural production loans or by purchasing at fixed prices, and use part or most of it. (2) The government must promote the production of flour, cloth, oil, sugar, fuel, and other daily necessities by providing raw materials to manufacturers, or through industrial production loans, or by purchasing at fixed prices, and use part or most of it. (3) The government must promote the production and export of export products such as raw silk, ore, tung oil, hides, tea, and pork through export loans or by purchasing at fixed prices, to enrich foreign exchange reserves. (4) The government should first make planned supplies and coordination of daily necessities for officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers in production factories. In addition, the surplus materials should be used to stabilize prices to meet the needs of the city, so that hoarders cannot speculate and achieve the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<p>3. Stabilizing currency value. (1) Quickly handle enterprises that do not need to be run by the state, sell counterfeit properties and surplus materials, and reorganize tax revenue to make up for the financial deficit in the short term and prevent inflation. (2) The government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system so that it can gradually return to normal. (3) The currency systems in Northeast China, Taiwan, and Xinjiang must be reorganized at the same time to make them consistent.</p>
<p>4. Reforming the financial system. The reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the country's economic policy, with increasing agricultural and industrial production as its main purpose. Financial institutions should each have major specialized businesses so that the phenomenon of general commercialization can be eliminated. Public and private banks must also be planned and distributed throughout the country to make it a systematic financial network, not concentrated in a few coastal cities, especially the corner of Shanghai. The methods are: (1) Taking the county as the grassroots institution of the financial system, supporting the establishment of county banks to facilitate construction and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. (2) The county bank should follow the principle of one bank per county. At the beginning, the capital county accounts for 40% and the central government accounts for 60%. When the county autonomy work is gradually completed, the central capital will gradually decrease, reaching a ratio of 70% in the local area and 30% in the central government. The central government should also provide specialized personnel to provide business guidance. (3) County banks are backed by the China Farmers Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on the type and needs of their business. (4) Land finance is long-term in nature. The government must designate special funds and issue land bonds to solve the problem. At the appropriate time, a special bank should be established to manage it. During the transition period, the land finance funds of the Farmers Bank should be enriched to assist county banks in developing their business. (5) The China Farmers Bank operates the warehousing, transportation, processing, and land loans of farmland water conservancy agricultural products to facilitate farmers and support the prosperity of Chen Village as its professional scope. (6) Bank of Communications operates industrial, mining, and transportation loans to develop industries as its professional scope. (7) Bank of China operates domestic and foreign trade lending and international exchange business (including overseas remittances, as its professional scope). (8) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau absorbs people's savings deposits, handles small remittances, and should cooperate with the principle of cooperation cooperatives, the principle of benefiting the countryside and using it in the countryside to develop the rural economy. (9) The Central Cooperative Treasury operates cooperative loans for production and transportation, and supports the organization and development of various cooperatives as its professional scope. (10) The Central Trust Bureau specializes in trust and insurance and is responsible for guiding the public's trust and insurance businesses. (11) The Central Bank is the bank of banks, and its main responsibility is to regulate the country's finances, closely link finance with the economy, and complete economic construction. (12) After the restoration is completed, the Four Joint Offices will be transformed into a design and liaison agency, or merged with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance to establish a Financial Management Bureau, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, to give it special authority. (13) The government should provide reasonable and effective guidance and control over provincial and municipal banks and ordinary banks. (14) Each national bank should implement specialization according to its nature, and be responsible for liaison and guidance on ordinary banking businesses of the same nature. The scope and location of the establishment of its branches should be determined separately according to its business objectives.</p>
<h3>Develop Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce: Support the Entire Country's Finances with the People's Productive Capacity and Total Income</h3>
<p>5. Agriculture. Farmers account for the absolute majority, and agriculture is the backbone of China's economy. Agriculture is developed, the countryside is prosperous, and farmers have their purchasing power. Then industry has something to rely on, and society can be stable. Therefore, developing agriculture and prospering the countryside is the main object of future economic policy implementation. The methods are: (1) Reform the distribution relationship of agricultural land so that it can be fully improved and utilized. The lease relationship should be thoroughly promoted according to the principle of "25% rent reduction", and try to realize "tillers own their land" as much as possible, so that farmers can fully engage in production. (2) Establish collective farms, use new machines and methods to increase production, to demonstrate to farmers, and expand agricultural experiment and research sites to improve production technology. (3) In agricultural reform, water conservancy is important. Large-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of main canals should be actively carried out by the state. Small-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of branch canals should be supervised by the central government and handled by the provinces and counties. It is allowed to issue water conservancy bonds, and the local government is responsible for maintaining the completed projects. (4) Expand the organization of cooperatives and mutual aid societies to facilitate agricultural loans and reduce the oppression of farmers by high interest rates. (5) Actively and universally build a warehouse system to protect the interests of people's production. (6) Establish nurseries and promote afforestation, and effective measures must be taken to maintain their growth. (7) Use agricultural slack to train farmers in techniques such as civil engineering and stonework, and develop rural sideline businesses to improve farmers' lives. (8) Develop animal husbandry and provide assistance and guarantees. (9) Encourage fishing and protect its development.</p>
<p>6. Industry. Without a self-sufficient people's livelihood industry to protect agriculture and enable the exchange of agriculture and industry to help each other, the foundation of China's economy cannot be established. Therefore, the current development of industry should focus on people's livelihood industries. The government must urgently improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and provide industrial loans with the greatest convenience. At the same time, formulate an overall construction plan, determine the scope of state-owned, local-operated, and private-operated, classify, divide regions, and clearly stipulate and supervise the implementation, and predetermine their annual production. The government and the people will work together to establish them in stages. The methods are: (1) In the first phase of developing machinery and chemical industries, we should strive to adapt to the needs of agriculture and forestry and solve the problems of water conservancy projects, chemical fertilizers, farm tool warehouses, and transportation tools. (2) Industrial construction should be located inland as much as possible where fuel and raw materials are cheap. (3) For some industries, start with equipment engineering, purchase some parts from abroad, and gradually develop into a fully manufactured industry. (4) Except for trunk railways, large-scale hydropower plants, steel plants, and mining industries, which are stipulated to be state-owned or locally-operated, the remaining industries should be encouraged as much as possible to be operated by private individuals in a cooperative manner. (5) While encouraging some manufacturing industries, we should also focus on industrial experiments and geological surveys to achieve progress and new inventions. (6) Pay special attention to using agricultural slack to develop rural handicrafts to meet the needs of cities and the needs of the international market. (7) Develop various mineral resources to adapt to the needs of industrial development and export goods. (8) The government should gather public and private banks to organize a Renaissance Financial Company to invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in the company to purchase machines and raw materials from abroad. (9) The bank's loans to industrial and mining enterprises should effectively supervise their use for production and accept fixed assets such as factory buildings and machinery as collateral, and should not limit the loan standard to half of the value of raw materials and finished products, and should not adopt unreasonable methods such as deducting interest in advance and collecting handling fees to increase the burden of industrial costs. (10) The factory equipment dismantled from Japan, except for those that must be state-owned, should be contracted by various industries to dismantle, transport, install, and start construction. The existing enemy and puppet industrial and mining businesses in China that are not sold at auction should be leased to private individuals. (11) Wages should be reasonable. Provinces and cities should universally implement a wage review system to stabilize production order, and labor and management should work together to increase production.</p>
<p>7. Commerce. Imports exceeding exports are a major problem in the national economy. The government should encourage exports by effective methods to gradually balance foreign trade. The methods are: (1) Domestic trade should make full use of the adjustment of financial institutions and the convenience of land, sea, and air transportation to stimulate trade and increase the total amount of trade in the country and promote balanced development. (2) In terms of import in international trade, except for production tools, raw materials, and map instruments, strict restrictions should be imposed to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures, and trade financial institutions should be used as much as possible to encourage and assist private individuals. The foreign exchange deposits of Chinese people abroad should be implemented quickly in accordance with the economic emergency measures plan. (3) Export businesses should be actively encouraged, and the foreign exchange earned can adopt the import and export license chain method to develop import and export business, and various special products should be considered for improvement and expansion to standardize them as major export goods. Rural handicrafts should also be organized and improved in cooperative ways and concentrated on export to balance domestic surplus. (4) The National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office should be responsible for contacting the International Cooperative Trade Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance and wholesale cooperatives in various countries and try the barter system.</p>
<p>8. Transportation. (1) The central government officially announces which railways are trunk lines and which are branch lines. The trunk lines are fully operated by the central government, and the branch lines are allowed and encouraged to be operated by local and private individuals under the central management system. (2) For highway projects, in addition to the national roads between provincial capitals, the central government encourages the provinces to build them, and the central government assists them with financial resources and manpower. Some branch lines are encouraged by the province to be built by the counties, and highway transportation is encouraged to be operated by the people. (3) Airports are operated by the government, and aviation businesses are encouraged to be operated by the people as much as possible. (4) The trunk lines of waterways are dredged by the central government, the branch lines are dredged by the provinces, and the smallest branch lines are dredged by the counties. Important ports are operated by the central government, and secondary ports are operated by the cities. The waterways and ports operated by the provinces and cities are assisted by the central government with financial resources and people, and shipping is encouraged to be operated by the people as much as possible. (5) Telegraphs are operated by the central government, and wireless stations with special needs in the sea and air, such as aviation and shipping, should be allowed to be set up by themselves under the central management. (6) Long-distance telephone trunk lines are laid by the central government, and branch lines in various provinces are laid by the provinces, with the central government assisting them. County and township branch lines are laid by the counties, with the provinces assisting them. (7) City telephones are encouraged to be operated by the people under the management of long-distance cooperation.</p>
<p>9. Finance. (1) The government should quickly protect and support agricultural production to enrich land tax revenue, protect and support industrial production to enrich direct goods and two tax revenue, protect and support trade businesses to enrich customs revenue, protect and support the salt industry to enrich salt tax revenue. The finances of the entire country should be supported by the production capacity and total income of hundreds of millions of people. (2) The central and local financial revenue and expenditure system revised last year, the county (city) level finances are more abundant than before, while the provincial level finances have less financial resources and huge expenditures, and the revenue and expenditure are unbalanced. The central competent authorities and the provincial governments should negotiate and revise them to ensure that the local financial resources are sufficient to meet the needs of self-reliance. (3) The current direct goods, customs, and salt four tax rates are not suitable for the economic environment at the time. Therefore, they cannot fully grasp the grain tax source and equalize the people's burden. They should be adjusted. (4) Adjust the names of individuals, strictly control the tax source, simplify the procedures, eliminate malpractices, and enrich tax revenue. (5) The unsold false properties and surplus materials should be sold as much as possible. The production and transportation professions that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to the people to operate or sell stocks to enrich revenue. (6) In addition to reorganizing tax revenue, the two treasuries should use the method of issuing securities to obtain from the people and make those with financial resources bear a heavier burden. (7) Based on the needs of national construction, determine the survival and abolition of agencies. Overly large agencies must be streamlined, and redundant agencies must be merged. (8) Expenditures that are not urgently needed by the state and beneficial to production and construction must be saved and stopped.</p>
<h3>Provinces and Cities' Grain Borrowing to be Stopped Starting This Year: Overcome Idle Capital and Bring it into the Right Track</h3>
<p>10. Grain Administration. (1) Starting from the 36th year, the borrowing of grain from provinces and cities will be stopped to reduce the burden on the people. The principal and interest of the grain borrowed over the years should be repaid by the central government based on the grain price in various places at the time of maturity, and the rate should be determined by the legal currency, which will no longer be used to offset land tax, so as to clear the debt. (2) In the 36th year, the land tax in various provinces and cities will still be temporarily collected in kind to meet the needs of the country, but the land with poor grain production and inconvenient transportation will be converted into legal currency. The conversion area and conversion standard will be verified and determined by the Ministry of Food based on the circumstances. (3) The part of the land tax collected in kind that should belong to the provinces, cities, and counties will be purchased by the central government in accordance with the conversion standard of the neighboring currency collection area. The provincial and county public grain near the currency collection provinces and counties will still be used locally and will not be purchased. In order to facilitate the overall planning of military food and take care of local support. (4) The land and grain agencies in the currency collection counties and cities shall be abolished. Their affairs shall be handled by the county and city governments. The land and grain agencies in the real collection counties and cities and at the provincial level shall be retained, and their expenses shall be fully borne by the central government. (5) The Changpingcang system must be established urgently. Important locations in the Yangtze River Basin must complete the initial warehouse construction and grain storage plan within this year. The accumulation of grain in the local area should also be strengthened and universally implemented to increase reserves. (6) The China Farmers Bank should actively promote the business of agricultural warehouse collateral and agricultural product transportation and sales, with the financial strength to assist the government in supporting production, controlling grain sources, and regulating surplus and deficiency.</p>
<p>11. Guiding idle capital into the right track. The biggest problem of the current economy is the concentration of idle capital and competitive speculation. The idle capital goes wherever it wants. In order to make the economy into a normal state, we need fundamental plans on the one hand, and overcome the scourge of real idle capital on the other hand. Therefore, guiding idle capital to participate in production is the most important plan at present. The methods are: (1) The national bank cooperates with the production and construction plan to provide low-interest loans and guarantees to legitimate enterprises, so that legitimate enterprises do not need to rely on high-interest loans as soon as possible. (2) Stipulate the highest amount of interest rate. High-interest loans that exceed the stipulated rate will not be guaranteed and will be punished. (3) During the transition period, national banks may as well absorb idle capital with the highest interest and transfer it to production. The government will subsidize the interest difference between the deposits and loans. (4) Allow people to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank at the listed price with gold for the purchase of licensed imported goods, and allow gold to be used as a priority to purchase state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet properties sold by the government. (5) The government designates national banks to conduct gold savings deposits or issue gold bonds, all of which are given preferential interest and guarantees, and a special supervisory committee is organized to supervise them. (6) Crack down on manipulation and establish a sound and reasonable securities market.</p>
<p>12. Absorb foreign capital and strengthen production and construction. (1) The government should welcome foreign capital in a preferential manner to help the development of domestic industry. (2) Some types of industries can also be operated in cooperation with foreign capital. (3) Facilitate overseas remittances, give fair exchange rates preferentially, and encourage guarantees for overseas Chinese investment, and facilitate them to run various domestic industries. (4) Register the foreign exchange assets of nationals deposited abroad and use them for domestic production and construction.</p>
<p>13. Reasonably resolve the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers. (1) Implement the rationing system so that officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers can maintain the minimum necessary life. (2) The government is responsible for solving the education problems of the children of officers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, and workers. (3) Strictly implement the principle of equal pay for the same job and equal pay for equal work to reduce the phenomenon of disparity in the treatment of employees in various agencies.</p>
<p>14. Severely punish acts of using political power to facilitate private enterprises. When officials and businessmen are not separated, and public is sacrificed for private, a good economic policy can be distorted. If a part of private enterprises in the society receives special treatment, legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises will be devastated. This is a prerequisite for the effective implementation of economic policy and must be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>15. Improve economic organizations. In order to seek cooperation between the government and the people and make economic policies work for the benefit, the economy, finance, and finance are closely connected and form a whole. We must take care of the overall situation and make overall plans. In the past, various ministries of the Executive Yuan governed themselves, and the Supreme Economic Committee was the same as a mere formality. The reaction of the people to economic policies could not be communicated and expressed. In order to remedy this malpractice, the methods are: (1) The government should improve the organization of the National Economic Committee and be responsible for designing, supervising, and implementing economic policies. (2) The society should launch a broad economic construction movement to improve the understanding and interest of the people in economic construction, and use the power of official-private cooperation to eliminate the difficulties of economic construction.</p>

<h3>Northeast National Army Advances on Multiple Routes, Recovering Benxi and Fanjiatun, Fierce Battle at Siping with Communist Army Using Poison Gas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] General Sun Liren paid another visit to the Chairman on the evening of the 19th. Because some people in the capital have been paying close attention to the Northeast war in recent days, this reporter specially visited Mr. Sun, who said: The Northeast war is not as serious as the rumors suggest, and things depend on human effort. The Northeast is China's lifeline and should not be viewed pessimistically. The difficulties faced by the Chinese Communists are no less than our own. Recalling the difficulties we faced this time last year, they were even greater than today, yet we were able to overcome them safely. Therefore, even if there are difficulties, we must strive to overcome them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] The core position of Siping was surrounded by two divisions of the Communist army on the night of the 18th, launching a melee. The Communist army charged eleven times, with close-quarters combat, and the fighting shook the heavens, resulting in heavy casualties. However, the fierce fighting is still in progress, and the National Army is determined to defend Siping at any cost. On the 18th, the National Army in Tieling launched an eastward attack, driving away the Communist army from Xifeidi, about eighty li west of Tieling, to ensure the Tieling stronghold on the periphery of Shenyang. Zhou Fucheng's troops fiercely attacked Benxi, southeast of Shenyang, and completed the encirclement of the Communist army on the evening of the 18th. After a night of attacks, they completely recovered Benxi by the morning of the 19th, while clearing out the surrounding Communist army. At the same time, they tracked and advanced to the southwest, recovering Gongyuan (5 kilometers south of Benxi) at noon. On the 19th, the military still controlled the southern section of the China Changchun Railway to Haicheng. However, engineering vehicles had already entered the vicinity of the Fenshui Station north of Dashiqiao to repair a destroyed small bridge and power lines. The Communist army's Independent Division One, Three Regiments, and part of the Twelfth Brigade, totaling approximately 5,000 troops, along with mountain artillery, launched a fierce attack on the outskirts of Yingkou City from dawn on the 18th. At dusk, the National Army abandoned its outer strongholds and firmly defended the urban area of Yingkou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fanyang, 19th] Telephone call from Siping at 8:00 AM: The battle in Siping is still raging fiercely in the city. The Communist army is using all means to seize Siping. In the afternoon of the 18th, they even used poison gas obtained from Japanese prisoners of war. That night, more than 6,000 Communist troops broke into the streets, surrounding the core positions of our defending troops on three sides. The two sides engaged in a fierce melee. The Communist army launched more than ten assaults overnight, all of which were repelled by our defending troops. Fierce fighting was still in progress as of the morning of the 19th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Telephone call from Siping at 7:00 PM: More than 60,000 Communist troops, with their most elite units and best equipment in the Northeast, have been fiercely attacking Siping for nine days, firing over 10,000 shells and launching over seventy assaults. Our army, outnumbered, has fought bravely and calmly, day and night. From the night of the 18th to dusk on the 19th, the Communist army drove thousands of farmers tied with yellow explosives to launch continuous assaults. A back-and-forth battle is currently unfolding near the Provincial Government and the Central Bank's west building. As of the time of this dispatch, melee combat is still in progress. The fighting in the suburbs has subsided, and no artillery fire has been heard. It is believed that the Communist army's main force has suffered nearly half of its losses and has consumed a large amount of ammunition. They may be awaiting reinforcements. The National Army's southward reinforcing troops are moving very quickly, and it is reported that the northward reinforcing troops have bypassed Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 19th] The National Army's advancing corps captured Pingdingshan and Xinkaihe, south of Datun, at 6:00 PM on the 18th. The Communist army left behind more than 200 bodies, and the remnants retreated towards the Dongxi Twelve Majiazi Yaotun area west of Datun. One body of a Communist army regimental commander was found. According to a captured deputy regimental commander, they were transferred from the vicinity of Siping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 19th] On the morning of the 18th, the National Army advanced southwest with a powerful force, making rapid progress. After clearing out the Communist army near Datun, 38 li from Changchun, on the 18th, they defeated the main force of the Communist army, about four divisions, entrenched in the Fanjiatun and Daheilinzi area at 11:00 AM on the 19th, capturing 4,000 troops and then stationed themselves in Fanjiatun, an important stronghold between Changchun and Gongzhuling. According to military sources, this well-equipped and powerful advancing corps is continuing to advance south, conducting a vigorous search for the Communist army fleeing to Gongzhuling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 19th] The National Army on the Jilin-Changchun Railway has a strong force. On the 15th, they began to clear out the Communist army entrenched on both sides of the Jilin-Changchun Railway. After clearing the area near the Yatong River, they turned to pursue the Communist army harassing the vicinity of Huapi Factory. At the same time, our Jilin-based attacking troops launched a pincer attack. The Communist army, unable to cope from both ends, has been routed and is no longer organized.</p>

<h3>National Economic Council Resolves to Rename Property Tax as National Reconstruction Contribution, Determining Valuation Standards for State-Owned Enterprises</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The issue of the one-time property tax collection, which has attracted attention from all parties, was discussed in detail at the fourth meeting of the National Economic Council on the afternoon of the 19th, and there was heated debate. It was resolved to rename the one-time property tax as the "Special National Reconstruction Contribution," and the collection principles were decided as follows: (1) Raise the starting point for the contribution (possibly starting from 300 million or 500 million); (2) Target wealthy households; (3) Implement in larger cities; (4) Nominate through public opinion organs, and determine the contribution amount after investigation; (5) The detailed methods will be drafted by the Finance Subcommittee and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed the issue of selling state-owned enterprises. It was resolved to complete the valuation and sale procedures by the end of July, and a valuation committee will be formed to specialize in valuation work. It is reported that the valuation standard will be based on the price level in 1937, with reference to current market prices.</p>
<p>The issue of subsidies for state-owned enterprises was also discussed at the meeting. In principle, subsidies for railways, highways, post and telecommunications, coal, and coal mines will be canceled. However, in special circumstances, a gradual reduction method will be adopted. It is estimated that the government spends as much as 300 billion yuan per month on subsidies, and canceling them will significantly help balance the budget.</p>
<p>Another important agenda item at the meeting was the method of repaying deposits in banks, money shops, and private individuals before the war. According to the original method proposed by the Ministry of Finance, it would be about 70 billion yuan. The meeting generally agreed that this amount was too small, while representatives of the banking industry believed that it should not be too high. It was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance and the Finance Subcommittee for research, in principle: (1) Limited to the occupied areas; (2) Limited to before the "July 7th Incident"; (3) For original contracts exceeding the limit, the original contract will prevail. Private deposits will be handled in accordance with supplementary regulations for civil litigation.</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed the coal supply and production methods proposed by the Economic Department's Resources Committee. It was decided to find ways to increase production in existing coal mines south of the Yellow River, and to develop new mines south of the Yangtze River. Coal prices will be assessed based on production costs to encourage production.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Qitian proposed methods for provincial and municipal governments to control prices, and another committee member proposed a plan to prevent price increases after July 1. It was resolved to hand it over to the Price Committee for consideration.</p>
<p>Today's meeting was chaired by Chen Lifu, with Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Wang Xiaoyu, and Tan Boyu attending. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Far East Economic Commission Held Plenary Committee Yesterday, Representatives' Opinions Diverged, Decided to Hold Subcommittee Meeting First This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its first and second plenary committee meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively, to discuss the resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Council that "the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East should be responsible for collecting more information on economic recovery and conducting investigations, and if necessary, also conduct field investigations, and then submit a report on the results to the next Council meeting." Many representatives expressed their opinions, and they were mostly divergent. Finally, the proposal of the US representative Davis was adopted: "A subcommittee should be organized by the plenary committee of this commission to discuss the resolutions of the Council. At the same time, the opinions of the members of this commission should also be discussed. The chairman of this commission should invite the representatives to submit concrete proposals, and the subcommittee should discuss the most important of them to save time."</p>
<p>The plenary committee therefore decided that a subcommittee should be organized by the representatives of various countries at 9:30 this morning to hold a meeting to formulate a work procedure based on the suggestions of the representatives, and then submit it to the plenary committee for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>At the meeting at 10:30 this morning, the Economic Commission will continue to hold its seventh meeting to discuss the temporary rules of procedure of the General Assembly, which have been reviewed by the Review Subcommittee several times.</p>
<p>Indian Representative Raises Questions</p>
<p>After the plenary committee meeting began yesterday morning, the Indian representative Nehru said: The countries of Asia and the Far East are now eagerly awaiting the start of construction work, so all preliminary investigation work should be carried out as quickly as possible. Therefore, he raised the following questions: (1) Why does the United Nations Economic and Social Council need us to collect more information instead of instructing us to take active and direct investigation work based on existing information?</p>
<p>(2) How does the Secretariat's Economic Commission for Europe proceed with this matter? Does the Council also need the Commission to collect more information?</p>
<p>(3) We know that the European Working Group, in summarizing the data analysis, has suggested what supplementary materials the group needs. Is there a similar suggestion for Asia?</p>
<p>(4) When the Council held its first few meetings, it asked the Secretary-General to pay special attention to the short-term and long-term economic assistance needed by countries in the United Nations that had been damaged by the war. Has this been done? Can this committee get a report for reference?</p>
<p>Two Secretaries Respond Separately</p>
<p>Rosenbo, Deputy Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission, immediately replied: The nature of the investigation work and how to start the investigation can be discussed and decided by the meeting of this commission, so the Secretariat should not draft a definite procedure.</p>
<p>Woven, Assistant Secretary-General of the Council, added that the Secretary-General had organized an investigation team to investigate the situation of the countries in the United Nations damaged by the war, and studied it by means of inquiries. At present, the reply on the European side has been submitted to the European Commission.</p>
<p>British Representative Proposes Suggestions</p>
<p>The British representative Crowe immediately proposed: (1) The Secretariat of this commission can ask questions based on the following points: A, the transportation situation in the disaster-stricken areas of Asia and the Far East, especially focusing on railways and waterways; B, the production and distinction of coal, and the possible methods of supply; C, various conveniences for training senior administrative and technical personnel related to economics. (2) Each member state should elect a representative to form an advisory committee to assist the Secretariat in its work. (3) The investigation report should be submitted to the next committee meeting for discussion. He also said that this commission is currently unable to send investigation teams to various places for investigation, but can send a member to any country for investigation to supplement the supply of information.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Objects Again</p>
<p>The Soviet representative Stitesinko objected to the British representative's proposal, saying: Mr. Woven has explained that the Secretary-General has inquired with various countries, and the reply has not yet been received, so this commission should not repeat it. The scope of the British representative's proposal seems too narrow. The purpose of this commission is broader, and concrete steps should be taken to organize two or three field investigation teams to study the needs of the countries of Asia and the Far East and submit their reports to the next meeting.</p>
<p>Suggestions from Chinese and American Representatives</p>
<p>The US representative Davis said: Before a plan is determined, it is not advisable to start field investigation work. The report of the working group can be used as the starting point for the work plan. He suggested that before starting the research, this commission should instruct the Secretariat to arrange the plan according to the urgency of the work. This delegation will submit a list of the points that need to be investigated to the General Assembly at any time.</p>
<p>The Chinese representative Li Yi said: The Chinese delegation is currently unable to propose complete topics to suggest to the General Assembly. He suggested that it is best to submit a plan to the Economic Commission based on a joint study of the issues that all representatives newly consider urgent to investigate.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative asked: Which countries are the inquiry forms sent to? What kind of questions do they include?</p>
<p>Rosenbo, Deputy Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission, replied: The inquiry forms include economic, foreign exchange, and other issues. All countries in the Far East and Asia that have suffered war losses are among those being inquired. If any representative needs this form, a copy can be issued for reference.</p>
<p>Jiang Tingfu Points Out Two Points</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang Tingfu immediately pointed out: (1) Regarding the collection of information, this commission should give the Secretariat concrete instructions; (2) Regarding the field investigation, the problem is very complicated, and there may not be enough time, so the importance of the issues must be prioritized before choosing the investigation objects. Currently, due to the financial limitations of this commission, it may not be possible to conduct field investigations on all issues.</p>
<p>American Proposal Adopted</p>
<p>The meeting continued in the afternoon. Chairman Jiang Tingfu was absent due to other matters, and was replaced by Vice Chairman Guadeno. The chairman submitted the US representative's proposal, which is to organize another subcommittee to discuss the opinions of the representatives, etc., to the plenary committee for voting. However, the Soviet representative immediately expressed opposition, saying: In this case, the British representative's proposal will be the basis for discussion. Also, why did the chairman submit the US representative's proposal for voting first, while the proposals submitted by the Indian representative and myself were not submitted for voting?</p>
<p>The Australian representative seconded the US representative's proposal. The committee passed it. Then, the chairman asked the representatives to express their opinions on the working group's report. The Indian and British representatives expressed their approval of this report. The committee adjourned at 4:15.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Water Level Approaching Record of 1915, Water in Xiguan, Guangzhou Has Entered Houses, Shijiao Dyke in Critical Condition, People Panic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] In recent days, newspapers have been reporting on the flood disaster in the largest possible space. In 1915, the Shijiaoyuan dike collapsed, and the losses in the counties along the river were inestimable. At that time, the water in the Xiguan area of Guangzhou was also deep enough to reach the eaves, causing a tragedy that had not been seen in a century. Recently, the counties of Dong, Xi, Bei, and Han Rivers have been suffering from prolonged rains, and many houses and buildings have been submerged. The flood is raging, and the water level is approaching the record of 1915. Many dikes in various places have collapsed, and the most important Shijiao Dyke is also in critical condition. The water level is about to reach the top of the dike. If it collapses or is submerged, the counties in the Pearl River Delta will be completely submerged. In some streets in Xiguan in this city, water has entered the houses. Citizens are making necessary preparations, and some are even planning to flee, as if the tragedy of 1915 is about to repeat itself. The citizens are panicking, and the price of rice has risen by 40,000 per dan compared to yesterday. Mayor Ouyang Ju issued a statement this afternoon, confirming that the Shijiao Dyke is safe (it was rumored on the 18th that the Shijiao Dyke had collapsed), and called on citizens to remain calm and cope. He also said that the city government has made adequate preparations. Even if the flood continues to rise, rescue boats, emergency food supplies, medicines, refugee shelters, and police forces have all been prepared. He hopes that citizens will work together to maintain the overall situation. Mayor Ouyang inspected the flooded areas of Xiguan late last night, and went to various power plants at 4:00 PM this afternoon to instruct flood prevention work. The Guangdong Provincial Assembly also convened an expanded meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss emergency measures.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Air Transport Corps</h3>
<p>Dispatches Aircraft to Drop Food Supplies</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 19th] Since the dike near Shijiao in Guangzhou collapsed, the water in the city is one foot deep today, and the water in the North River is still rising. A large number of refugees are fleeing from the suburbs to Guangzhou. Some suburban areas affected by the floods are 10 to 15 feet deep. According to a report after inspecting by the Executive Yuan's aircraft on the 18th, the disaster in the Dongjiang area is extremely severe, while the floods in the Xijiang and Beijiang areas of southern Guangdong are lighter.

<p>Changchun Grain Prices Soar</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 19th] Since the price of grain in Changchun began to rise in April, it has soared with the changes in the situation. The price of sorghum rice, which was sold for one yuan per catty in early April, is now sold for one hundred yuan per catty, and even then it is scarce. The Changchun Municipal Government recently received an order from Chairman Chiang through the Executive Yuan, instructing to investigate the reasons for the price increase. In addition to the order, a report was attached, pointing out that several local tyrants and wealthy merchants in Changchun are the manipulators. It is reported that these people did many evils during the puppet Manchurian era, so after their names were announced, the people of Changchun all believed that justice would finally be served, but they hoped that the law enforcers could severely punish them.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Civil Servant Retirement and Pension System</h3>
<p>This month, on the 12th, the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting passed amendments to the "Civil Servant Retirement Law" and the "Civil Servant Pension Law," which will be promulgated and implemented by the National Government. At a time when the government is vigorously implementing political reform, the personnel administration authority, in order to permanently establish the civil servant retirement and pension system, has made necessary amendments to the two regulations regarding civil servant retirement and pensions, which were promulgated during the Anti-Japanese War, based on the current situation. This is indeed an extremely important measure for personnel administration.</p>
<p>Personnel administration is a new term of the 20th century, and scholars of administrative law expound it as a science. However, personnel administration and practical application should not be neglected, and the practicality of personnel management precedes theory and legal codes. In modern capitalist countries, the application of personnel administration to industrial and commercial management has achieved high efficiency. In democratic countries like Britain and the United States, the application of personnel administration to agency management has established a sound civil servant system and enhanced good administrative efficiency. The term "civil servant" generally refers to personnel engaged in public duties. The British civil servant system is the most perfect. Ministers are "political appointees," whose tenure depends on party affiliation, while administrative officers are "experts," appointed according to law, holding their positions for a long time, being experienced in departmental affairs, regardless of party affiliation, possessing specialized knowledge and administrative experience. Their promotion, transfer, retirement, and pensions are governed by regulations. Any party entering the cabinet respects them equally and rarely discriminates against them. The scope of civil servants in the United States is broader. All personnel classified by position, as well as those not classified by position, such as those who pass competitive examinations, public school teachers, and employees of public enterprises, are considered civil servants, but this does not include the president and political appointees. The meaning of civil servant in our country is also broad. According to Article 10 of the new Criminal Law: "A civil servant is defined as a person engaged in public service according to law and ordinance." Article 24 of the Civil Servant Service Law stipulates: "This law applies to civil servants receiving salaries and other employees of public service institutions." According to this interpretation, all personnel engaged in public duties are civil servants, whether they are political or administrative officials, whether they are hired or appointed, or are local autonomous personnel, they are all called civil servants. Since the scope is so broad, interpretation is extremely difficult. Everything regarding appointment, promotion, transfer, and performance evaluation is confused in terms of customs and legal principles, and retirement and pensions are even more neglected. In 1934, the "Civil Servant Pension Regulations" were promulgated, but upon closer inspection, their content was superficial and impractical. The so-called protection for civil servants was merely empty talk.</p>
<p>The recent completion of the legislative process for the "Civil Servant Retirement Law" and the "Civil Servant Pension Law" by the Legislative Yuan is a prelude to a sound civil servant personnel administration and a key to political democratization. Retirement and pensions are essentially a safety net for the old, weak, injured, and deceased. Retirement pensions, also known as retirement allowances, and pensions are both a system of consolation and relief. They are essentially the state's compensation for civil servants' service and the rights that civil servants should enjoy for being loyal to their duties. The purpose of the state in establishing this system is to promote administrative efficiency, not out of compassion. Civil servants enjoy this benefit, and they and their families have a certain guarantee, so they will be able to concentrate their energy, without distractions, and regard public service as a lifelong career. Therefore, the civil servant retirement and pension system is a modern and good system, worthy of promotion, and can be imitated by all public service institutions. Now that these two bills have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will soon be promulgated and implemented, there are still aspects of their content and matters to be noted after implementation that remain to be discussed. The arguments are as follows, and it is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>1. The Meaning of Civil Servant is Too Narrow. The current laws and regulations in our country define civil servants broadly, while Article 2 of the two bills stipulates: "The civil servants referred to in this law, except for chiefs of police, are limited to those currently employed and whose qualifications have been examined and registered by the examination and appointment agency." This scope seems too narrow and deviates from the meaning of the widespread implementation of the retirement and pension system. Regarding whether political appointees should be interpreted as civil servants, according to the "Civil Servant Service Law," political appointees should be regarded as civil servants. The two bills also stipulate that the provisions for retirement and pensions apply to political appointees, which is to recognize political appointees as a type of civil servant. However, the civil servants referred to in the two bills are limited to those who have been examined and registered. Customarily, political appointees do not undergo examination and registration, so there are doubts as to whether they should enjoy retirement and pension rights or whether the provisions of the two bills apply to them. Therefore, on the one hand, it restricts low-level civil servants and civil servants who have not been examined and registered, narrowing the meaning of civil servant; on the other hand, it gives preferential treatment to political appointees, which is unfair.</p>
<p>2. The Issue of Retirement Age. The British system stipulates that civil servants who reach the age of 65 and have served for more than ten years are eligible for retirement and receive retirement allowances. The American system stipulates that civil servants who reach the age of 60 or above and have served for more than fifteen years are eligible for retirement and receive retirement allowances, both shortening their years of service. Article 3 of our country's "Civil Servant Retirement Law" stipulates that only those who have served for 30 years or those who have served for 15 years and have reached the age of 60 are eligible to apply for retirement and receive retirement pensions, which is too long. It should be noted that if civil servants serve for too long, bureaucratic habits become deeply ingrained, and the common will is lacking, which easily leads to the incompetence of the bureaucratic apparatus. In terms of both theory and practice, the retirement age should not be too long. Furthermore, according to custom and law, administrative officers retire after 30 years of service, and political appointees can apply this provision. But, one must ask, do political appointees in any country in the world today have the custom or law of retiring after 30 years of service? This analogy is not a good policy.</p>
<p>3. Methods of Raising Retirement and Pension Funds. According to the "Civil Servant Retirement Law," retired civil servants are eligible to receive annual retirement pensions and lump-sum retirement pensions, the amount of which is calculated as a percentage of the annual salary based on the monthly salary at the time of retirement. According to the "Civil Servant Pension Law," if a civil servant dies on duty or dies of illness after 15 years of service, their family members may calculate a percentage of their annual salary based on their monthly salary and continue to receive pension benefits within 20 years. However, the method of raising these funds, and their position in the national budget, are not specified in the constitution's basic national policy, nor are they comprehensively outlined or listed in the two bills. There will inevitably be many problems in the future. The common methods of raising retirement and pension funds in various countries are generally of two types: one is the government-funded system, that is, all expenses are borne by government funds; the other is the government and civil servant co-funded system, that is, each bears a portion. The government's portion is allocated from regular expenses, and the civil servant's portion is deducted from their regular salary. Civil servants in our country have meager salaries and often work on an empty stomach. If their salaries are further deducted to prepare for retirement, it will inevitably affect their will to serve. Therefore, the government-funded system should still be adopted for raising retirement and pension funds in the future.</p>
<p>From the above discussion, it can be seen that the establishment of a civil servant retirement and pension system is important. In theory and practice, the parts that should be amended or paid attention to should be considered. It is hoped that the legislative and administrative authorities will preemptively seek remedies and not allow this perfect system to have any regrets. When the two bills were promulgated in the wartime capital years ago, the general civil servants did not pay attention to them, and the personnel administration authorities did not implement them, because there were problems in the content. However, this amendment is more progressive than before, and the points that remain to be discussed can still be effectively remedied, so that this good system can be established, which will not only be fortunate for the civil servants, but also for the country's path towards constitutional democracy.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lisheng Urges the Press to Reduce Publication of Yellow Journalism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng received reporters at the Lishi Society at 3:30 pm on the 19th, sincerely urging the press to reduce the publication of yellow journalism. Zhang believes that the social news reports and supplementary works of some newspapers recently cater to low tastes, vividly describing events, which has a great impact on customs and people's hearts. He believes that excessive written embellishment leads to suspicion of encouraging immorality and theft. Zhang emphasized in his conclusion that he especially urged all newspapers to pay special attention to legal, moral, and public welfare perspectives when publishing social news in the future, uphold the positive spirit of educating the public, give full play to the true meaning of public opinion, reduce sensationalist stimulation of bad deeds, and engage in more effective discussions. Minister Zhang also specifically pointed out that newspapers in China have a particularly important value for social education.</p>

<h3>The United Board of Directors Decides to Pilot Order and In-Kind Loans, Draft Principles to Be Submitted to the Economic Commission for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 19th] The United Board of Directors held its 346th meeting on the morning of the 19th, chaired by Vice Chairman Zhang. The following were discussed: (1) The government is currently drafting an economic reform plan, with particular emphasis on increasing production and stabilizing prices. In order to cooperate with the government's policy, it is proposed to formulate principles for order loans and in-kind loans and pilot them first. However, the scope of application should be determined by the government's competent authorities, and several kinds of materials should be selected to formulate order or purchase plans separately. In agriculture, special attention should be paid to agricultural water conservancy loans and the pilot in-kind loans for farmland improvement. It was decided to submit it to the National Economic Commission for approval. (2) Export material enterprises need capital turnover for operation and sales, and they have been assisted with loans many times. The "Measures for National Banks to Handle Loans for Exporting Materials Abroad" have been formulated and implemented. However, the current prices are unstable, and some manufacturers, after obtaining loans to purchase and hoard goods, often intend to wait and see and sell at a higher price. When the loan expires, they apply for an extension. If there is no limit, it will lose the original intention of guidance and promotion and will be difficult to avoid fueling hoarding. It was decided that each bank should undertake various types of loans in accordance with the original method. Regardless of the acceptance of bills, the pledged funds should be recovered upon maturity and should not be extended. (3) Most of China's fuel oil depends on imported products, which is a huge drain. In order to achieve self-sufficiency in refining and save foreign exchange expenditures, the government has recently invested in the establishment of the China Oil Transportation Company by the China Petroleum Corporation and the state-owned China Merchants Bureau to be responsible for the overall planning of various oil products required by aircraft and national defense industries. The company is now expanding its business, opening up ocean routes, and equipping oil tankers and adding wharf warehouses to raise capital. It was decided to approve loan assistance.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Rejects British and French Appeals, Unwilling to Participate in Discussions on the Marshall Plan, Bevin Returns to London Looking Worried</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Bevin returned to London from Paris today, looking very serious and worried. He told reporters that there was nothing else to report except for the communiqué issued last night and the Soviet Union's rejection of British and French appeals announced in Paris this morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The Soviet Union, through its embassy in Paris, today rejected the invitation from Britain and France to meet together to discuss the implementation of the Marshall Plan for European recovery. Upon hearing the news, all circles in Paris felt that Bevin and Bidault's efforts to obtain continental cooperation would inevitably fail. A communiqué issued by the Soviet Embassy strongly stated that the Soviet Union believed that any European recovery plan launched in accordance with the suggestions announced by Marshall at Harvard University was "impossible." Diplomatic circles here felt sorrowful but not surprised by the Soviet response, which confirmed the views of the Truth Daily that the Marshall Plan was a plan to make Europe a vassal of Wall Street. Before attending a banquet hosted by President Auriol this afternoon, Foreign Secretary Bevin hosted reporters at his residence, announcing that he had reached an agreement with Foreign Minister Bidault to establish a special European Economic Committee to implement the Marshall Plan, with the aim of promoting European recovery with American aid. This committee will set up four technical committees, attached to the European Economic Commission, an agency of the United Nations, to study the four major problems of coal, steel, transportation, and agriculture in Europe separately. Bevin said that he would continue to work hard to seek Soviet cooperation, but if it fails, the British and American plans will still be implemented.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 19th Broadcast: A diplomatic correspondent for an evening newspaper here said: The Soviet Union may accept the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the European Economic Commission, but may propose counter-proposals to Marshall's suggestions. The Soviet side believes that the European recovery plan should not be carried out under the guidance of the US side, but should be handled by the United Nations European Economic Commission. It is reported that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson held preliminary talks with Molotov today and has telegraphed the results to Bevin. Bevin returned to London today and is scheduled to report to the House of Commons this afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 19th] A highly authoritative diplomatic source said: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed great interest in the development of Marshall's European recovery plan, but he refused to make a formal statement before the plan was clarified.</p>
<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers Invite Molotov to Discuss European Economic Reconstruction, If the Soviet Union Rejects, Britain and France Will Proceed Alone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 18th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault, after discussing for two days, jointly invited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today to attend a meeting on June 23 to discuss the US aid to European recovery plan. The joint request proposes that if the Soviet Union intends to participate, the three countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can meet at a mutually agreed-upon location. According to well-informed British sources, London and Paris are the most suitable locations for the three-country meeting. Both British and French representatives said that the two foreign ministers did not consider the possibility of the Soviet Union refusing to participate. Reliable sources said privately that if the Soviet Union's reply is negative or inconclusive, Britain and France will ignore it and proceed according to the plan formulated by Marshall.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The attitude of the Soviet Union towards the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the negotiations has become the most concerning issue for political figures here. Judging from the Soviet Union's economic power in Eastern Europe and Marshall's statement that the Europe mentioned in his plan includes all parts west of Asia, the Soviet Union should obviously be one of the leading countries in responding to the Marshall Plan. Observers predict that the Soviet Union may adopt the following two attitudes: (1) In order to avoid a clear resolution, the Soviet Union will hinder the progress of the plan, making the US Congress unable to take action on the plan within the year. (2) If the Soviet Union itself refuses to participate in the Marshall Plan, it may order the small countries of Eastern Europe to participate in the leading organization of the plan to delay or destroy its work. It has also been learned that representatives from Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia inquired with French officials about the Marshall Plan yesterday in their capacity as experts. Some observers believe that this is the first step for Eastern European countries to participate in the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>British and French Negotiations Notify the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris] After meeting in the morning, the Foreign Ministers of Britain and France met again at 5 pm this afternoon. Foreign Minister Bevin is scheduled to have dinner with British Ambassador Duff Cooper tonight, and will return home by plane at 10 am tomorrow morning. Regarding the European economic recovery plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall, British and French officials are conducting negotiations on time to discuss this issue. The French Foreign Minister also met with Soviet Charge d'Affaires Avakubov, informing him of the progress of the British and French talks. In addition, it is learned that the detailed progress of the talks between Britain and France has also been notified to the US Embassy.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 18th] According to responsible sources, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last night, informing Foreign Minister Molotov of the British government's views on the aid to Europe plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall. In addition, it is learned that French Charge d'Affaires Chambeardier also visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik this afternoon, submitting a memorandum from the French government on the plan proposed by Marshall to Deputy Foreign Minister Malik.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns to Office</h3>
<p>Will Explain the Marshall Plan to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 18th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson told reporters today that Marshall's plan mainly concerns the economic reconstruction of countries affected by the war. Therefore, Ukraine and Belarus may participate in the plan independently, just as they participated in the UN relief efforts. Moreover, participation in the plan does not involve commercial agreements. The main need of the countries concerned at present seems to be to provide details of their urgent needs, rather than to talk about what they can supply. The US Ambassador to Shanghai will arrive here tonight. It is expected that he will inform Molotov of the full details of the Marshall Plan so that the Soviet Union can decide its attitude towards the plan.</p>
<h3>Investigating Military Facilities in Hungary, the Soviet Union Rejects the US Request, Britain Will Still Urge the Soviet Union to Report on the Political Situation in Hungary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Budapest, 18th, United Press] The chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary (Soviet representative) Viridov has rejected the US request to investigate military facilities in Hungary. The reason is that members of the commission have no right to conduct such investigations, and he said that he will submit this request to officials of the Soviet occupation authorities for consideration.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Minister of State McNeil told the House of Commons that the government is waiting for the report from Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson, continuing to ask the Soviet Union for information on the situation in Hungary. In response to questions from members of Parliament, McNeil believed that it was impossible to send a fact-finding mission to Hungary and Southeastern Europe. He also believed that it was not appropriate to lodge a complaint with the United Nations organization based on the limited information currently known about the situation in Hungary. Regarding the case of the trial of former Hungarian Minister of Reconstruction Mies Terte and 43 members of the Farmers' Party and other parties on charges of treason, McNeil said that the British representative in Hungary is closely monitoring the development of the case, but because the trial will take a long time, it is not convenient to send inspectors to attend all court sessions of the case.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson told British reporters today that when he visited Molotov on Tuesday night, he discussed the opinion letter of the British government on the situation in Hungary with the Hungarian issue as the theme. Molotov seemed impatient with the so-called "continued interference of Britain in Hungary's internal affairs." When I told him that Hungary was still subject to the armistice agreement, Molotov seemed unmoved.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Opposition Party Accuses the Government of Unconstitutionality</h3>
<p>Trials of Political Prisoners Have Begun</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 18th] Opposition MPs today accused the cabinet in the National Assembly of unconstitutional actions by not asking the parliament for a vote of confidence before asking to be granted full powers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 18th] One of the forty-three defendants charged with treason, former Farmers' Party MP Hahn, testified in court today that the special treatment he received in prison caused him to lose consciousness for a week, so he did not know what he was signing. He cannot be responsible for the confession that was read out in court. The confession stated that former Prime Minister Nagy had secretly formed an underground army and established underground arsenals with other Farmers' Party leaders, and the weapons hidden were unknown to the Disarmament Commission. Hungarian Minister of Transport and Communist leader Turo has not appeared in Budapest for two weeks, causing speculation in all quarters. It is said that Turo has gone to France on a special mission.</p>
<h3>Former President Roosevelt Criticized Wallace, Saying He Was Fickle</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 19th] In an article in "Collier's Magazine," Farley stated that Roosevelt had opposed Wallace as a future presidential candidate in 1938, because Wallace's behavior was unpredictable. Farley said that when he spoke with Roosevelt in April 1938, Roosevelt told him: "Wallace might be a presidential candidate, but I (Roosevelt referring to himself) would rather support Ickes, because Ickes can consistently adhere to his principles, while Wallace's behavior is fickle and difficult to predict."</p>

<p>Labor-Management Arbitration Board Decides on Two Principles for Handling Wage Disputes; Strives for Simple and Rapid Resolution of Disputes in Various Industries; Appoints Five Small Groups to Handle Cases Separately</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 11th meeting of the Labor-Management Arbitration Board was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday, with over 20 representatives attending and observing. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Wu Kaixian. After three hours of discussion, 15 articles of the wage arbitration method were passed and submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for record, but the content was not disclosed. The Arbitration Board appointed five small groups to handle wage dispute matters and also appointed a group to study dismissal methods. Other issues, such as whether the current month's wages should be based on last month's index and retirement benefits for public utilities, were left for discussion at the meeting at 3:00 PM today due to time constraints. Regarding the handling of wage disputes in various industries in the future, the Labor-Management Arbitration Board decided on two principles yesterday: (1) On the proactive side, it hopes that both parties will share the difficulties and achieve a fair resolution. While workers' income is expected to increase, production should also increase to reduce the burden on the factory. (2) On the reactive side, if the factory's economic situation is indeed poor and it cannot afford the increased wages, the Arbitration Board may consider the situation and discount or reduce wages accordingly.</p>
<p>Personnel of the Five Small Groups</p>
<p>The Board also noted the large number of wage dispute cases. Although some were mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, many were still submitted to the Arbitration Board for review. Yesterday's meeting decided to prioritize simplicity and speed in arbitration. The Board appointed five small groups to handle cases according to industry classification. The first group consists of Tian Heqing, Shui Xiangyun, and Zhang Yongqin. The second group consists of Liu Jingji, Zhou Xuexiang, and Gu Zusheng. The third group consists of Xu Jiqing, Fan Caiqiu, and Xu Lin. The fourth group consists of Xia Enlin, Shen Ding, and Fan Zhenbang. The fifth group consists of Shen Baokui, Liang Yongzhang, and Zhao Zuyuan. The personnel of these three-person groups consist of one representative each from the labor side, the management side, and the Arbitration Board. If there are disputes in various industries submitted for review, the small groups will investigate the actual situation, refer to the arbitration methods, and draft an arbitration opinion to be submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion. In cases requiring urgent resolution, the Chairman and Standing Committee members may decide on the handling and implement it first, then submit it to the plenary meeting for ratification.</p>
<p>Studying the Advantages and Disadvantages of Dismissal Methods; Another Group is Appointed for Research</p>
<p>Regarding the request from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to cancel the dismissal method set by the Arbitration Board and to handle dismissals according to Article 27 of the Factory Law, the plenary meeting considered that the method was originally formulated in response to the actual situation. To determine the current advantages and disadvantages, the meeting appointed Li Jianhua, Tian Heqing, Yan Esheng, Shui Xiangyun, Liu Jingji, Xia Enlin, Liang Yongzhang, and seven others to form a small group for research, with Li Jianhua as the convener. The research results will be submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for decision.</p>
<p>In addition, workers from the six major public utilities in the city were advanced 200,000 yuan each by the management at the end of April, and the management requested that each worker repay 20% or 40,000 yuan per month. Yesterday, the Arbitration Board decided that those with a monthly income of one million yuan or more should repay 20% per month, while those with a monthly income of less than one million yuan should repay 10% per month. In addition, it was stipulated that retirement benefits for public utilities exceeding five million yuan should be discounted. Currently, workers, in view of the high prices, are requesting that the actual situation be considered and revisions be made. This matter will be discussed at this afternoon's meeting.</p>
<p>According to attendees, regarding whether the current month's wages can be based on last month's index, the plenary meeting decided in principle that if the company is indeed unable to afford it, the matter can be considered and handled after review by the small group, based on the wage arbitration methods and past practices.</p>

In addition, workers in the hand-operated knitting machine groups in Districts 1, 2, and 3 sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition. They claimed that labor and management had agreed on the 11th that June's wages would be paid at 85% of 23,500 times the base index, but the management suddenly notified them on the 17th that they would temporarily pay at 15,000 times the base index, which is a violation of the agreement.</p>

His son, Da Jing, recently applied for suspension of detention for his father for the third time.

<p>Stray Dogs Competing for Food; Foul Odor Spreads</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to determine if there were any bodies in the sunken ship, the Feng Shipping Bureau hired five divers yesterday to take the Shenhua ship to the sunken ship and search for bodies in the ship's cabins. Because of the long round trip, the Shenhua ship will return to Shanghai today. Yesterday, a floating body was also recovered on the beach of Chongming Island. The deceased was identified as Yin Hongsen, a passenger on the Dafeng ship. The Bureau has transported the body back to Shanghai and handed it over to his family. The Shishan side also identified a body, named Ju Puxing. There are still more than 20 unidentified bodies on the beach of the Taicang Floating Bridge, which have not been collected. They are lying on the beach, where stray dogs are competing for food, causing the bodies to be fragmented and the foul odor to spread.

<p>Guan Hongda's Former Lover, Li Hua, Commits Suicide in Qingdao</p>
<p>Hanged in Full Dress Under the Cherry Blossom Tree; American Gold Found on Her Body</p>
<p>[Report from our Qingdao, 19th] Li Hua, a Shanghai dancing girl, also known as Suzhen, arrived in Qingdao from Shanghai by boat yesterday afternoon. That night, she hanged herself in full dress under the cherry blossom tree at the Zhonglie Shrine on Liaoning Road. Her body was discovered this morning, her face still beautiful as if alive. Several photos of a man, a small ingot, a gold chain, gold pieces, US dollars, and French currency worth about seven or eight million yuan were found near her, along with an unmailed letter addressed to Huang Yun, No. 6 Wuling Village, Kangding Road, Shanghai, but containing no letter. The suicide of this young woman who came to Qingdao specifically to commit suicide has caused a sensation in the city. Because photos of Shi Yongji, the dispatch director of the Qingdao branch of the Central Bank, and Ding Zeting, an employee of the Salt Affairs Bureau, were found near her, it was discovered that the deceased had cohabited with the film star Guan Hongda, but had since separated and was working as a dance hostess in various places. In Qingdao, she fell in love with Ding Zeting. She came to Qingdao this time specifically to propose marriage, but unexpectedly, the situation changed, and his heart was as cold as iron. She wandered alone in the middle of the night, with no place to entrust her feelings, and chose the path of suicide.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This reporter visited Guan Hongda at midnight yesterday and learned that Li Hua was 26 years old and a native of Shanghai. She had lived with Guan for six years. During the period of cohabitation with Guan, she formed a theater troupe with Yin Xiuling and others two years ago and went to Qingdao to perform. However, things did not go smoothly. In Qingdao, a rift developed between the two, and Li requested a separation. Later, the theater troupe returned to Shanghai, while Li Hua stayed in Qingdao and became a dance hostess at the Dahua Dance Hall. After a year, Li Hua met Liu Miao during her dance hostess period, and their friendship eventually led to cohabitation. Although Li had found a new lover, she never forgot Guan. During this period, she expressed regret to Guan's friends.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Li Hua was escorted to Shanghai by her friends and reunited with Guan. They were still deeply attached to each other and thought of rekindling their relationship, but Guan was afraid that the past rift would be difficult to repair, so he said that since they had separated, it was better to go their separate ways. Seeing this, Li Hua knew that the water could not be recovered, so she decided to go to Qingdao again to resume her dance career. Before leaving, Guan gave her 80 US dollars, one million French francs, and two taels of gold to help her on her way. Unexpectedly, Li had the idea of ending her life after leaving Shanghai last Sunday, so she hanged herself at the Zhonglie Shrine immediately after arriving in Qingdao. (The attached photo is a small portrait of Li from her lifetime.)</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Health Bureau, after the Caojing District Municipal No. 8 Hospital was approved for establishment, Director Li Zhonglin actively prepared for it. However, due to the lack of suitable housing in the area, it was necessary to build a hospital building. Later, the district donated a land base of about five mu, and construction is now being rushed after bidding. It is feared that it will be difficult to complete all of it in the short term. In order to serve local residents, the hospital started outpatient services in rented houses from the Suo District Office on April 10 this year. The average number of patients treated daily is about 70. The funds for construction and other expenses of the hospital were allocated by the Municipal Government in April. Due to the current high prices, the original estimated budget is far from sufficient. Currently, it is planned to build seven large wards first, which are estimated to accommodate about 50 beds.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Cheng Yi, 34 years old, from Suzhou, manager of the Taiwan Provincial Xintai Company and former director of the Taiwan Provincial Trade Bureau, resides at No. 30 Daxin Village, Jiangsu Road, Shanghai.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wang Kewen, a native of Zhenjiang and manager of the Guotai Silver Company at No. 479 Sichuan Middle Road, was summoned by the Economic Section of the Police Bureau yesterday afternoon. It is said that at 11:30 AM on the 17th, five unidentified men accused the company of engaging in black market gold trading, went directly to a small room on the third floor, and confiscated several bars of gold on the spot, as well as a bank draft for 97 million yuan that a customer was settling.

<p>Taiwan Provincial Glass Industry Representatives Come to Shanghai to Request Machine Allocation</p>
<p>Guo Hubo and Lin Songmo, representatives of the Taiwan Provincial Glass Industry, came to Shanghai from Taiwan a few days ago to request the allocation of glass factory equipment from the Executive Yuan United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). During the Japanese rule, there was originally a large-scale glass factory in Hsinchu, Taiwan, but it was destroyed by the war. Taiwan has abundant glass raw materials and fuel and can be obtained locally, so the manufacturing cost is only one-third of that in the mainland. If UNRRA can allocate machinery and transport it to Taiwan for production, it will definitely be able to produce cheap glass for sale in the mainland. It is said that the two representatives, Guo and Lin, plan to go to Nanjing in the near future to present everything to the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>Dying Without Seeing Each Other; Wife and Children Wail Outside the Gate</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Fu Shishuo, one of the major traitors of the puppet government, was executed by firing squad at the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 10:40 AM yesterday, after being sentenced to death by the High Court on September 28 of last year. This is the third person executed in the Shanghai High Court's Hanhao case.</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday, the prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, Luo Shouchang, the chief clerk, Xu Kaisu, and the clerk, Zheng Jinsheng, arrived at the Shanghai Prison and temporarily set up a court in a small courtyard with the warden, Xu Chongwen. At 10:00 AM, the traitor Fu was brought out from the High Court Detention Center. Fu's hair was already gray. He was wearing a beige Palissy long gown, floral striped cloth pants, an ocher-colored lined shirt, and black cloth shoes. Knowing that his death was imminent, his face was pale. Prosecutor Luo first asked about his age and origin. He answered, "57 years old, from Yongjia, Zhejiang." Then he asked, "Do you know that the High Court sentenced you to death in your traitor case, and the Supreme Court has approved the original sentence?" He answered, "I know." He asked, "The court rejected your request for a retrial, and the Supreme Court also rejected your appeal. Have you received this ruling?" He answered, "Received." "Today, by order of the Ministry of Justice, you are to be executed. Do you have anything to say?" He answered, "I have nothing to say, but I would like to write two letters to my family. I don't know if the prosecutor can allow it?" The prosecutor agreed to his request and had him sit at a small table set up next to him. There were several sheets of paper on the table. Fu tried to remain calm, dipped his pen in ink, and pondered, but his body and hands trembled slightly. He seemed to have endless longing for the world. He wrote two letters, one to his wife, Zhang Tu Jun (the niece of Zhang Taiyan), and one to his younger brother. (The original text is below)</p>
<p>Hands Cuffed Behind His Back; Killed with One Shot</p>
<p>The will was written smoothly and neatly. After writing, he carefully looked at it again, correcting the strokes that showed signs of trembling. He handed it to the bailiff next to him and was taken to stand in front of the court again. The prosecutor asked if he needed a morphine injection. He replied that he did not need it. Then he signed the statement and asked not to be handcuffed. The prosecutor did not agree. After his hands were handcuffed behind his back, he was taken to the execution ground. At this time, the traitor walked unsteadily, and two bailiffs supported him. After arriving at the execution ground, he sat on the wooden chair that had been prepared. The bailiff Cai Yunlong raised a pistol and fired it into the back of his head. There was only a loud bang, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his right cheek. The traitor Fu leaned to the right and fell to the ground after a while. This generation of major traitors ended their life at 10:40 AM.</p>
<p>Family Arrives One Step Too Late</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, his wife led one of her children to rush to the prison. At that time, the iron gate had been locked. Unable to see the last face, she could not enter. But hearing the gunshot inside, she knew he had been killed. She wailed loudly outside, like a madwoman. Later, she called the China Funeral Home and had the body transported away at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Before the war, Fu was a professor at Datong University. At the beginning of the organization of the puppet government, he was the first to participate. He served as the puppet Minister of Railways, the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province and concurrently the Commander of the Security Forces, and the puppet Minister of Construction. During his tenure as the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, he assisted the enemy in suppressing the countryside and harmed people's livelihood. After the victory, he was arrested by the military and sent to the High Court for trial.</p>
<p>The Will Shows No Remorse to His Wife and Younger Brother</p>
<p>"Lujun. Now I am saying goodbye to you and my sister forever. Please handle everything in accordance with the will. In the autumn of Zhaomin and Dianjie, the world is full of worries. I am worried about the decline of the country. I have no time to grieve my death. I know it is impossible to do, but I do it for the people. Now I sacrifice for the people, seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence. Please don't be too sad. Spring is always short in this world, and the moon outside the sky is always round. There will always be a time for eternal reunion. Take care and say goodbye. Teaching and raising children is a heavy responsibility. Finally, I urge you to protect the car. I cannot send letters to all relatives and friends. Please extend my regards. Fu Shishuo, last words. 10:10 AM, June 19, 36th year."</p>
<p>"Jian, my younger brother. Our brotherhood has come to an end for now. Please take care of each other at the meeting below. Qingfu is not dead, and the習難 is not over. Later generations must work hard for the country. You must not give up eating because of my martyrdom. The spirit is immortal, and there will be a time to meet again. Everything after death must be simple. It is best to entrust it to Tu Kun and hope that he can handle it. I wish you well. My sister-in-law and all my nephews send their regards. Your brother, Shishuo, last words. 10:10 AM (actually 10:20 AM), June 19, 36th year."</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Hu Yunfeng, an employee of the Zhenxing Fan Store at No. 15 Yu Garden Road, dressed in military uniform and wearing a colonel's rank, was found wandering around in the North Railway Station at around 10:00 PM last night. His actions were suspicious. He was interrogated by military police, and he presented an identity card issued by the Army Independent Third Brigade directly under the Military Commission on May 1, 36th year. However, it was found that the Military Commission had already been revoked, which was obviously forged. He was taken to the North Station Military Police Team, where he admitted that it was all forged and that he was impersonating a military officer. He was immediately sent to the Fast Unit for legal action.</p>
<p>The Request to Return the Racecourse Rejected by the Executive Yuan's Appeal</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Race Club sold the Shanghai Racecourse to the Japanese firm Hengchan Company for 760,000 legal currency. Before the third batch of 360,000 yuan was paid, the Pacific War broke out. After the victory, the relevant authorities regarded it as enemy-puppet property and took it over. The chairman of the club, a British national named Annoji, appealed to the Executive Yuan, disagreeing with the disposition of the enemy-puppet property processing bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area and requesting the return of the racecourse. Now the Executive Yuan has decided: "The appeal is rejected -" The reason for its decision is roughly as follows: According to the appellant, the Japanese firm Hengchan Company did not pay the third installment of the purchase price as scheduled, so the conditions attached to the sales agreement were obviously not met. Therefore, the effect of the agreement should also be lifted, and the ownership of the site should still belong to the appellant. However, according to the original administrative agency (i.e., the processing bureau), the sales contract signed by the appellant with the Japanese firm Hengchan Company in February of the 28th year was not a preliminary agreement. Once signed, it would have legal effect. The various claims made by the appellant are obviously inconsistent with the facts. The effect of the sales contract will not be discussed for the time being. However, since the appellant argues based on whether the attached conditions have been met, according to the explanation, it is clearly a legal act with attached conditions. The issue of the effect of the conditions being met or not met should be resolved by the interested parties by filing a lawsuit with the competent judicial authorities. Now that an appeal has been filed with the Executive Yuan, it is not in accordance with the law and cannot be accepted.</p>

<h3>Clayton Hopes the Soviet Union Will Participate in the Marshall Plan for European Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 18th] Deputy Secretary of State Clayton, a key figure in the Marshall Plan for European recovery, recently stated that the United States hopes the Soviet Union will assist in providing for starving Europe. In a press conference lasting an hour, Clayton elaborated on the Marshall Plan, highlighting two main points: (1) The Soviet Union was previously an exporter of grain, fiber, and fuel, and should therefore also assist in resolving Europe's economic difficulties, especially in aiding countries bordering the Soviet Union. (2) The State Department has received reports of a bountiful rice harvest in the Soviet Union this year. Reporters then raised various questions, but Clayton avoided giving direct answers, only stating that the specific details of the economic aid plan for Europe have not yet been decided, and the final solution will depend on the European countries. Clayton continued: I will now travel to London and then Geneva to attend the International Trade Conference. I hope to hear opinions on the Marshall Plan from all parties during this trip, but I do not intend to hold formal talks with anyone. Regarding Vandenberg's proposal to organize a special bipartisan conference to decide on America's global aid plan, I express my support.</p>
<h3>Universal Disarmament Proposal Faces Major Crisis: Soviet Union May Exercise Veto Power</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 19th] Representatives of various countries in the United Nations believe today that if the Soviet Union exercises its veto power regarding the American proposal for universal disarmament, the UN's disarmament efforts will effectively come to an end. The possibility of the Soviet Union using its veto stems from the UN Arms Commission's passage of the American implementation plan on the 18th, submitting it to the Security Council and rejecting the Soviet proposal. After the meeting, reporters asked Soviet representative Gromyko what he would do when the case was submitted to the Security Council. Gromyko replied, "We will wait and see." Some representatives speculate that Gromyko will use the veto, and believe that if he does, the steps toward universal disarmament within the UN system will effectively be terminated.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] Representatives of the United Nations Security Council reportedly agreed today that pushing for a vote on major issues related to the establishment of an international peacekeeping force at this time would be futile. Attempting to resolve disputes through voting would inevitably lead to the Soviet Union exercising a series of vetoes, thereby damaging the entire plan.</p>
<h3>Eleven "Superfortress" Bombers Arrive in Turkey; British Fleet to Visit Turkey Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 18th] Reliable sources here claim that eleven "Superfortress" bombers purchased by the Turkish government from the United States have already arrived in Turkey. This has yet to be officially confirmed. A few days ago, a Turkish army aircraft, including one "Superfortress" bomber, performed a demonstration flight in Smyrna for American Air Force advisors.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 18th] Turkish newspapers report that two British aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and two destroyers will visit Istanbul next month.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 19th] The Turkish Parliament announced today that a delegation of ten British Members of Parliament will soon visit Turkey in return.</p>
<h3>Greek Troops Invade Southern Territory; South Protests to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] The Yugoslav representative to the United Nations today sent a letter to Lie, protesting the invasion of Yugoslav territory by Greek troops and requesting that the letter be forwarded to the Security Council so that it can immediately begin an on-site investigation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Has Learned the Secrets of the Atomic Bomb; Walsh Issues Warning</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] Walsh, the chairman of the advisory committee appointed by President Truman to handle the issue of compulsory military service, stated today before the House Naval and Air Forces Committee that he is well aware that the Soviet Union has the secrets to manufacturing atomic bombs. The Soviet Union is currently trying to use the United Nations to buy time and will be able to complete the manufacture of atomic bombs within three to four years.</p>
<h3>British Delegation Departs for the Soviet Union Today to Prepare for Important Trade Negotiations; Aim is to Conclude a Large-Scale Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] A spokesman for the Department of Commerce announced today that Overseas Trade Director Wilson will fly to Moscow on the 20th with eighteen advisors to hold important Anglo-Soviet negotiations to conclude a large-scale trade agreement. The government's announcement of this matter is significant, especially as Foreign Minister Bevin is in Paris discussing with France the implementation of Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan. Earlier, well-informed government officials said that whether or not the Soviet Union participates in the Marshall Plan, Britain is willing to sign a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The fundamental reason for Britain's trade negotiations with the Soviet Union is the need for Soviet timber and wheat and a deep feeling that "there is no intention to economically isolate the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Political Turmoil in Italy; Former President Agrees to Remain in Office Temporarily Until a New Candidate is Determined; Gasperi Cabinet's Position Unstable</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] President Nicola's intention to resign is firm, but he has agreed to continue to serve until a new president is elected. Leaders of various Italian parties gathered today to discuss this situation. So far, no one has been nominated as the successor to the president, and the fate of the Gasperi cabinet is once again in doubt. The cabinet will ask the Constituent Assembly for a vote of confidence within days. It is not yet known whether President Nicola's resignation will automatically lead to the resignation of the cabinet, but in any case, the president's resignation will inevitably cause a crisis. Although Nicola has agreed to continue serving until a new president is elected, this move has little effect on easing the tense situation. News tonight said that former Prime Minister Bonomi, 76, has the support of the two major parties, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, and is expected to succeed the president. The Speaker of the Constituent Assembly, Terracini, convened leaders of various parties in the assembly today to discuss the method of electing a new president. Gasperi hopes that the president will resign before the cabinet asks the assembly for a vote of confidence. Gasperi expects the assembly to cast a majority vote of confidence in his cabinet. If this hope is realized, the Prime Minister may submit the cabinet's resignation to the new president, who is expected to reject it. There are various reasons given for Nicola's resignation. Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party insists that Nicola resigned entirely due to physical and mental fatigue. The Socialist and Communist parties, which did not participate in the cabinet, said that Nicola's resignation expresses a lack of confidence in the cabinet.</p>
<h3>U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike Partially Resolved</h3>

<h3>British Colonial Secretary Declares Ceylon Will Become a Dominion; British Government Has Begun Preparations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Colonial Secretary Jones declared in the House of Commons today that Ceylon Island will hold a general election immediately, so that the new parliament can be established in October of this year. After its establishment, measures will be taken to make the island a dominion of the British Commonwealth (possibly within twelve months). If the island wishes to secede from the British Commonwealth, it will be allowed to do so. Jones's declaration stated that the British government declared in 1945 its willingness to cooperate with the people of Ceylon to facilitate its dominion status and expressed its intention to complete this goal within a relatively short period. To prevent delays in negotiations with the Ceylon government, the British government has ordered the immediate commencement of preparations to draft the necessary agreements.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] King George VI approved the appointment of Lieutenant General Lockhart as Governor of the Northwest Frontier Province of India today, to succeed Sir Caroe.</p>
<h3>Japanese Zaibatsu Active in Secret; Large Amounts of Capital Engaged in Black Market Trade; Disposition of Zaibatsu Stocks Will Take Two or Three Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Although Allied Headquarters recently stated that the industrial, commercial, and financial overlord structures controlled by the Japanese Zaibatsu have been fundamentally eliminated, the Zaibatsu's power remains very active. They still remotely control 80% of the commercial, industrial, and financial sectors. According to well-informed sources, it is easy to find the "Zaibatsu Octopus," whose "tentacles" have only been damaged, while its nerve center remains intact. Although the asset companies are awaiting liquidation in terms of organization and personnel, their subsidiaries are supervised by individuals with deep ties to the Zaibatsu, operating as independent companies and acting according to the orders of their former masters. There is currently evidence proving that large amounts of Zaibatsu capital are engaged in black market activities and making large profits. The banks of the four major Zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda, have not been reorganized and are operating in the same way as other "independent companies" connected to the Zaibatsu. Moreover, under the provisions of the anti-trust laws, each shareholder of a company can still hold 10% of the total shares. At the same time, the law cannot prevent stock holders from using different names to purchase more shares to control the company. Although the stocks are sold by the liquidation committee, according to the law, employees of the "independent companies" have the right of first refusal to purchase them. Therefore, after paying property taxes, all dividends are transferred to the Zaibatsu through the committee. In this way, most of the former Zaibatsu capital will still fall into the hands of the Zaibatsu.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The "Law on Adjustment of Disposition of Securities," passed by the former 91st session of the Diet, was decided by the current cabinet to be implemented on the 18th. The Association for Adjustment of Disposition of Securities, organized according to the law, was also established on the same day. Because the dissolution of the Zaibatsu and the reorganization of special management companies will result in a large number of stocks being offered to the market, this association was created to ensure that they are disposed of reasonably and democratically. It is expected that the face value of the stocks disposed of by this association will reach 20 billion yen, and it is expected to take at least two or three years to dispose of them.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission to Meet with Various Korean Parties</h3>

<h3>South Korean Military Governor Lerch Returns Home for Duty Report</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] Military Governor Lerch will return to the United States on the 23rd. In a conversation with reporters today, he said: "The purpose of my return to the country this time is to continue to request government assistance for Korea. The scope of assistance includes trade and civilian goods assistance, etc., because Korea lacks coal, salt, and cotton. After I leave Korea, my duties will be handled by Captain Haven."</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Passes New Fiscal Measures; General Confederation of Labor Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>Labor Strikes in Various Industries are Flourishing</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The powerful austerity plan proposed by French Finance Minister Schumann, which would increase tax revenue and reduce military and political budgets, has been largely passed by the French cabinet. The cabinet is scheduled to meet on Friday to make a final decision on the plan. According to reliable sources, Schumann's plan includes abolishing national subsidies for bread, milk, and coal, raising the prices of these goods, and increasing train fares, postage, car taxes, and tobacco and match prices. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) stated today that this plan will add an intolerable burden to the working class. This plan may compensate for part of the budget deficit, but it will inevitably increase the cost of living, depriving workers of the benefits they recently won during the strikes. The CGT has requested that all wages and salaries be revised starting on July 1. If this request is successful, the new efforts to balance the budget will inevitably be severely hit.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The four major department stores in Paris and other department stores in various places went on strike this morning. Banks in Paris remain closed today due to the workers' strike, with the exception of the National Bank of France.</p>
<h3>Liberal Party Launches Offensive; Katayama Cabinet Faces Difficulties; Katayama Reiterates Request to Borrow Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Observers here generally believe that the Katayama cabinet will be attacked by the Liberal Party in the Diet, but they did not expect that the Katayama cabinet's request to postpone the resumption of the session in order to prepare proposals would be met with a head-on blow from the Liberal Party. Therefore, the general estimation of the Liberal Party's offensive has been greatly increased, and attention is focused on all actions of the Liberal Party. It is reported that the party has appointed Hoshijima Jiro and Kitazawa Kichi to question Prime Minister Katayama's policy address, and Aoki Takayoshi to question Finance Minister Yano's financial address.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: Japanese Prime Minister Katayama recently told reporters that he will propose that Japan borrow foreign debt to help economic recovery, but he refused to disclose whether the Japanese government is prepared to submit a loan request, but said: "I do not believe that Japan can achieve economic recovery without foreign aid."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Establish Police State System Around the World; Dulles Comments on Soviet World Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Evanston, Illinois, 18th] Dulles, who served as Marshall's advisor at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, stated in a speech to the graduating class of Northwestern University on the 18th that the Soviet Union is adopting a policy of establishing "police states" around the world. If the Soviet Union continues to adopt this policy, it will lead to war. Dulles said: "The Soviet Union is a police state. The rulers of the Soviet Union have great faith in this system and believe that it should be implemented around the world. The Soviet Union is now effectively realizing this belief. Hungary is an example. The Soviet Union's attempt to implement a "police state" system around the world will lead to widespread conflict, even war. Even the Soviet people do not all happily accept the dictatorial rule of a few people. The number of political prisoners in the Soviet Union is greater than the number of Communist Party members. The conflict between police states and free states is difficult to compromise. We should ensure that the United Nations has the opportunity to discuss this matter, which is currently being discussed everywhere."</p>
<h3>"American Arrow" Arrives in Istanbul</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Istanbul, 19th] The "American Arrow," a round-the-world press delegation plane, has flown here from London.

Those who welcomed the plane at the airport included the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson, other diplomatic representatives, as well as the Mayor and Police Chief of Istanbul.</p>
<h3>Shaw Issues Written Statement Supporting Wallace</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Brussels, 18th] Ninety-year-old British literary giant George Bernard Shaw recently issued a written statement to Belgium, praising Wallace's peace movement speech and expressing support for Wallace's candidacy for U.S. President in 1948. He stated that various formulaic platitudes are not enough to avoid a third world war, only a leader with political talent can resolve this situation. The various questions answered by Shaw are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Does Mr. Shaw believe that Mr. Wallace's repeated statements regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and other countries are helpful in promoting the peace movement?</p>
<p>(Answer) Wallace's remarks are a great contribution to us and Europe, proving that Americans have a vision that is higher than that of country bumpkins. I hope that enough people will support Wallace to be President next year.</p>
<p>(Question) Can Mr. Shaw propose a formula so that the so-called Western countries can reach a basis for understanding with the Soviet Union to avoid a third world war? (Answer) In today's world, from Stalin to the most impoverished person, no one who is clear-headed and impartial does not recognize that a third world war means bankruptcy and suicide. Therefore, the good times of these few years should be fully utilized and not missed. Formulaic platitudes are useless, political talent can determine the progress of events, but charters, programs, and propaganda organs cannot be effective.</p>
<p>(Question) Why shouldn't the so-called victor nations provide the so-called conquered nations with their better food and supplies? (Answer) Only the goose that lays the golden eggs is worth nurturing, even if it fasts for a day or two a week. The current difficulty is that it is not easy for the victor nations to find food themselves.</p>
<p>(Question) Will Britain remain in India, or will it remain for a few more days? Who cares about this and what is the reason? (Answer) Gandhi, Nehru, Jinnah, Mountbatten, and thousands of unknown people are currently killing each other in Bombay, Lahore, Calcutta, the Northwest Frontier Province, and other places. Others think they care about India, but it is not enough to predict success or failure.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Elementary School Hygiene Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Ministry of Education issued the "Revised Elementary School Curriculum Standards," which included "Elementary School Hygiene Training Standards," purportedly aimed at fostering hygienic habits. Consequently, the hygiene curriculum for higher elementary grades was eliminated. Currently, the hygiene training standards in schools in Xiashi have not been implemented, and the hygiene curriculum has long been absent. It is likely that the situation is similar in other schools across the country. One wonders how those children of this generation who cannot continue their education will be equipped with correct hygiene concepts and proper hygienic behaviors when they enter society.</p>
<p>Education is the cornerstone of a nation's survival. Hygiene education, in particular, is fundamental to all education, as it is genuinely related to the rise and fall of a nation. A nation's vitality lies in its politics, economy, and military affairs, with education serving as the central hub. Education is divided into moral, intellectual, and physical development, with physical education as the foundation. However, physical education cannot be separated from hygiene. Physical education without hygiene is harmful rather than beneficial. The six arts of ancient Chinese education already encompassed these three aspects. Ancient Greek education emphasized both physical and mental development. It was not until the rise of religious educational thought in the Middle Ages that moral education gained prominence, ultimately forming the three-pronged approach, much later than our country's six arts education. The archery and horsemanship of the six arts served as a practical method of promoting physical education, starting with individual training and progressing to the cultivation of basic national defense skills. For the individual, it meant being "accomplished in both civil and military arts," and for the nation, it meant "those engaged in civil affairs must be prepared for military affairs," integrating national defense with hygiene. In 1936, our 139 athletes participated in the Berlin World Games, suffering a complete defeat! Before the War of Resistance, when the capital recruited military police, only six out of a hundred passed the physical examination. During the War of Resistance, only about 30% of the young people who applied to the Air Force in the tenth to twentieth intakes, and the students who applied to military academies ten times, passed the physical examination. On average, only about 10% of those who passed the Air Force exam were physical education specialists, which is truly alarming! It clearly demonstrates that physical education divorced from hygiene ultimately fails to produce sound physiques. How can we mechanize our national defense and modernize our country with such a situation? How can we become a truly first-class power? Only when the majority of the nation possesses first-class physiques can we have the strength of a strong nation. To raise the national physique to the required standard, we must pay attention to hygiene-conscious physical education. Our country has traditionally neglected hygiene education, failing to promote the national physique to the required standard, resulting in excessive mortality rates, lowered average lifespan, and affecting the nation's decline. According to statistics, there are 16 million patients in our country every day, with an average of one death per hundred people per year. In other words, there are 584 million sick young people nationwide, with 4.5 million dying from illness. Assuming each patient loses the equivalent of one dou of rice (including medical expenses, lost productivity due to illness, mental distress, travel expenses for relatives and friends visiting the sick, and reduced productivity, mental distress, reduced labor of those caring for the sick, and mental distress, increased losses for medical personnel such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacy staff, and the consumption of national drug supplies and business taxes, etc.), it amounts to 58.4 million shi of rice. This could create a hundred medical institutions for ten years, but instead, we lose a thousand. Assuming each death results in an average loss of 300 shi of rice (including all possible losses due to illness as mentioned above, plus living expenses, special medical and funeral expenses, etc.), it totals 1.35 billion shi of rice per year, enough to create a hundred large-scale factories. With a rice price of 400,000 yuan per shi, that is 5.4 trillion yuan in legal currency. According to the current report of the Minister of Finance, annual expenditures only require 2 trillion. The above sum would be sufficient to cover the national fiscal deficit for 27 years. We can reverse the current economic crisis by recovering just one twenty-seventh of the above-mentioned preventable losses through hygiene education. This is not groundless. During the eight years of China's War of Resistance, the officially announced number of military and civilian deaths was only 3.1 million, but it is estimated that about 4.5 million people died from tuberculosis last year alone. In reality, the mortality rate increases annually, and the loss from a single epidemic cannot be measured in numbers. Moreover, the average lifespan of Chinese people is only 30 years, with most dying before they can make significant contributions. Furthermore, few can be self-reliant before the age of 30, which means that society has wasted resources on their upbringing, and they cannot serve the country. Experts who have been cultivated make few contributions due to their weak health and short lifespans (great statements mostly require decades of accumulated experience and insight to produce the crystallization of their hard work). This is why our country lacks inventors, a truly unlimited loss to the nation and a great crisis for national survival! In less than a century, the nation will perish and the race will become extinct, without the need for foreign invasion. The Founding Father, in the Outline of National Reconstruction, stipulated that hygiene is one of the seven major construction projects, because the popularization of hygiene education and the development of hygiene services can make the people strong and increase productivity, so that the country can gradually become prosperous and can always survive in the world.</p>
<p>It is most ideal for citizens to develop good hygienic habits in higher elementary school. Because primary school children do not have the knowledge to read hygiene books, it is not easy to instill hygiene knowledge. Before education is popularized to the secondary level, higher elementary students are already the backbone of society. After graduating from higher elementary school, the absolute majority of children cannot continue their education and mostly enter society to make a living. If we do not instill all the more reasonable hygiene knowledge and basic medical knowledge in higher elementary school, the future of the country remains bleak! The backbone of society has a latent leadership role. If they still lack hygiene knowledge and medical knowledge, how can they improve society, break superstitions, and popularize scientific medicine to cooperate with the great cause of national construction? In the past, higher elementary hygiene textbooks mostly focused on physiology and anatomy, which was impractical and truly wasteful. As the Ministry of Education revises the secondary school curriculum standards, we feel that the higher elementary hygiene curriculum should be reinstated! We should not adhere to the notion that medical materials should not be included in hygiene teaching materials, because medical materials are far more meaningful than an emphasis on literal understanding and anatomy. The elementary school hygiene training standards should not be abolished, so as to train children's hygiene concepts and hygienic behaviors as much as possible, so that the next generation can earn respect for the country. How fortunate is the great Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Hilar Lymph Node Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuping</p>
<p>Hilar lymph node tuberculosis is very common in childhood. Its cause is the transmission of tubercle bacilli. The inhaled tubercle bacilli first cause initial lesions in the lungs, and then spread through the lymphatic system to the lymph nodes in the hilar region. The inflamed lymph nodes swell up, and this becomes hilar lymph node tuberculosis. The most notable symptom is a fever of unknown origin that persists for a long time, accompanied by loss of appetite, listlessness, and fatigue after exercise, and gradual emaciation. As for coughing? Some experience it, some do not, and it is not always certain. Accurate diagnosis requires the use of tuberculin skin tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate tests, and X-ray examinations. These are the duties of physicians and not within the scope of common knowledge, so I will not elaborate. Now, I will briefly explain the methods of treating sick children as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All those who are in close contact with the sick child, such as parents, grandparents, wet nurses, maids, cooks, and drivers in the family, and teachers and sick classmates in the school, are the most suspicious individuals and should be subjected to detailed inquiry and examination. If the source can be found, it must be isolated, because frequent contact with patients with active tuberculosis carries the risk of causing the child to develop repeated infections.</p>
<p>(2) The temperature and humidity of the room must be appropriate, and there must be fresh air.</p>
<p>(3) The patient must rest in bed, and the clothes should be loose and comfortable.</p>
<p>(4) The diet must be sufficient and provide all necessary nutrients, such as orange juice, tomato juice, cabbage water, cod liver oil, and other foods containing various vitamins.</p>
<p>(5) Even if the fever has subsided, any increase in activity must be in accordance with the doctor's instructions.</p>
<p>(6) During the convalescent period, all kinds of acute infectious diseases must be avoided as much as possible. The most important of these are measles and whooping cough, because contracting these two diseases again can aggravate the condition and sometimes even cause the danger of miliary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In short, hilar lymph node tuberculosis is a primary infection type in terms of pathology and is relatively easy to cure. Therefore, the patient's family does not need to be overly pessimistic. They should always follow the doctor's instructions and focus on recuperation.</p>
<p>Superfluous Words on Prevention</p>
<p>Since ancient times, a good doctor treats illness before it arises; treating illness after it has arisen is the work of an inferior doctor. In today's China, public health is backward, and hoping to discuss treating illness before it arises is impossible. When I first left medical school, my strict father wrote a motto for me to encourage me in my studies. I respectfully record it as follows: "One who knows how to treat illness but does not know how to prevent illness is a mediocre doctor; one who knows neither the method of preventing illness nor the method of treating illness is an inferior doctor; one who not only fully understands the condition and treats it according to the symptoms, but also can clearly understand the pathology and prevent illness before it occurs is a superior doctor; even if we cannot have the reality of a superior doctor, we should also have the ambition to be a superior doctor." Since I was born, several years have passed, and I have often remembered my father's instructions. I dare not abandon myself. Now that summer is approaching and epidemics are about to occur, I cannot sleep deep into the night, so I have drafted this article to repay my debt of manuscripts.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said: "After a great war, there will inevitably be a year of famine," because of the concentration of epidemic air. The Explanation of Writing said that epidemics are when people are all sick, that is, many people suffer from the same disease, which is clearly a popular infectious disease. The epidemics are epidemics, which are almost referred to as cholera in the summer and autumn. The Chinese people's understanding of cholera, in addition to the foolish people's belief in ghosts and gods, has always believed that it is caused by the feeling of soil qi. It is caused by the improper seasonal qi, which is called the disease of wind and wood hurting the soil. Therefore, the Great Treatise on Qi Transformation of the Plain Questions said that the outbreak of soil depression causes people's diseases, which is called cholera to relieve qi. The Book of Rites said that if you practice the summer order in the late spring, the people will suffer from many diseases; if you practice the autumn order in the early summer, the people will suffer from major epidemics. Now we know that climate can only promote the growth of epidemic bacteria. When Zhongjing said that cholera is caused by eating, saying that donkey and horse meat mixed with pork will cause cholera, and rabbit meat eaten with dried ginger will also cause cholera, the cause of the disease seems to have been attributed to diet, but it is not clear why. Since 1883, the German R. Koch repeatedly examined patients and corpses in Egypt and India, and even found bacteria in water pools outside the corpses. At that time, many drinkers became ill, and it was determined that this bacteria was the root cause of cholera. Other information about the symptoms and course of cholera seems unnecessary to elaborate on in this article.</p>
<p>The optimum temperature for the growth of cholera bacteria is about 37-40 degrees Celsius, so the peak season for cholera in our country is during the six months of summer and autumn. Our country's health administration has not been put on the right track, and health funding is insufficient. It is like looking for a needle in a haystack or throwing it into a void to talk about various health facilities and comprehensive daily epidemic prevention. In addition, the lack of general public health knowledge has led to the so-called epidemic prevention being only a temporary epidemic control work when disaster is imminent and close at hand, such as injecting vaccines, advising the public to be careful about food, and eliminating flies. These are mostly focused on preventing pathogens. Those who only have a superficial understanding think that once preventive injections are given, they can be carefree. However, they do not know that the effectiveness of preventive injections is limited, and their role is only to promote the increase in resistance to pathogens. This is only one aspect of epidemic prevention, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>The population in the sea is dense. Generally speaking, it is difficult to meet the hygienic standards for living and eating. In such a dirty environment, diseases can occur at any time, and few can escape the invasion of epidemic bacteria. However, whether one gets sick or not, and whether one dies or not, depends on the difference in the strength of each person's resistance. As far as I can see, the goal of epidemic prevention is to defend against pathogens, which is a golden rule, but personal health care should not be ignored.</p>
<p>(1) Avoid reckless eating and drinking: Eating and drinking is a great desire of people and an essential element for maintaining life. However, excessive drinking and unregulated eating will not only expand the contents of the stomach and impair the function of the digestive system, but also dilute the stomach acid and reduce the antibacterial effect of the gastric juice. Because cholera bacteria are acid-hating, stomach acid has antibacterial properties, so thin gastric juice is an incentive for cholera. This has been verified in animal experiments. Also, a survey of cholera cases in various countries found that they occurred more frequently on weekends, knowing that it was the result of binge eating and drinking and thin gastric juice. The weather is hot at this time, and people sweat a lot, especially the working class. Drinking a lot of water to quench thirst is most likely to dilute gastric juice, and diluting stomach acid is a major reason for weakening antibacterial power.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to cold and heat: On long and leisurely summer days, the climate changes greatly. The temperature difference between morning and evening is significant, so you should pay attention to increasing or decreasing clothes and food and opening and closing doors and windows at any time. Due to the scarcity of houses at sea, people live in small rooms. The heat is unbearable on summer nights, and sleeping in the alleys often leads to diseases. The so-called catching a cold is because people rely on the body temperature regulation function and let it work first. After a long time, they will naturally be exhausted and become ill. Air conditioners and electric fans are most fearful for the body temperature regulation function and should be used carefully.</p>
<p>(3) Appropriate work and rest: This is indirectly related to the first item mentioned above, because excessive labor often causes a lot of sweating, and it is supplemented with a large amount of water, fearing that the stomach acid will be diluted. Appropriate work and rest can increase the body's resistance. The onset of disease, in addition to the root cause, often does not occur without incentives. Can we all agree on this? The root cause of cholera is now known to be the transmission of cholera vibrio. The transmission always requires various appropriate opportunities and conditions. Prevention and attention to opportunities and conditions are important components of the voice of epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>Our country seems to want to complete the miracle of immunity with preventive vaccines alone. Those who prevent it prevent it as much as possible, and those who are sick are still sick. If the epidemic does not occur, the people should celebrate. Once it occurs, they will still be in a panic. The epidemic will not stop until late autumn. Then what is epidemic prevention? It is just a temporary epidemic control.</p>
<h3>Occasional Thoughts on Medicine</h3>
<p>— Canglong</p>
<p>Simple Treatment for Infectious Parotitis</p>
<p>Recently, a type of infectious parotitis has become very prevalent. Its symptoms are: "Initially, fatigue, headache, earache, chills, fever, sweating, and possibly nosebleeds. After one or two days, both sides (or one side) of the area below the ears swell up, the cheeks swell, the eyelids become puffy, the outer ear hurts, hearing becomes impaired, swallowing is difficult, and chewing feels difficult. Touching the affected area below the ears reveals a hard lump that is painful. Although the course of this disease is generally good, it still takes seven to ten days to recover. Complications of this disease include otitis media, orchitis or oophoritis, and meningitis, but these are rare. It mostly affects children, and is rare in adults. However, adults who contract this disease are more likely to develop complications, and the fever is also higher. There are often cases of impotence or infertility due to orchitis or oophoritis."</p>
<p>Because the pathogen for this infectious parotitis has yet to be discovered, the treatment methods are always palliative measures such as antipyretics, analgesics, and various poultices. I have recently encountered many cases of this disease. Initially, in addition to using the above-mentioned palliative methods, I tried using sulfonamide drugs and similar products. However, the results were not good, and it was impossible to recover until after eight to ten days. Later, I switched to using gray mercury ointment (Ungt Hycrgyrum Cinereu - 30%) on the affected area. It healed after two or three days. Repeated trials have shown it to be absolutely reliable. However, when using this mercury ointment, it should only be applied once a day, and each application should not exceed five hours to avoid excessive absorption of mercury into the body causing poisoning.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for using gray mercury ointment to treat this disease, they are very interesting and worth recording. I am attaching them below: In our hometown, this disease is called "pig head madness" because of its similar shape. If someone has it, their father or mother will take them to the private school and ask the old scholar to use thick cinnabar dipped in silver to draw a circle on the affected area, and write the character "tiger" inside the circle, saying that the tiger can eat the pig. As a result, this disease heals after writing the tiger character, which is very effective. At first, I did not notice it, thinking it was a coincidence. Later, I practiced painting after diagnosis and studied various colors, only to realize that the so-called cinnabar in silver is actually a compound of mercury. According to pharmacological reports, after mercury enters the body, it often collects in the salivary glands and salivary glands in the mouth under the ears, as well as in the mucous membrane of the large intestine. Moreover, the disinfection effect of mercury compounds is very strong, which doctors already know. Now, the reason why the old scholar's cinnabar pen in the countryside can cure pig head madness is nothing more than that mercury has a special disinfection effect on this disease. Based on the above reasons, I used gray mercury Huagao on this disease, and the result was very effective. All my colleagues may wish to try it to confirm it.</p>
<h3>Palliative Treatment for Pertussis (Whooping Cough)</h3>
<p>We all know that pertussis in the paroxysmal stage is really difficult to treat. And for the sick child, we see him coughing dozens of times in a row, with each breath chasing the previous, even to the point where his face turns purple and he looks like he is suffocating to death, which is really pitiful! We have used many pertussis syrups, but they only have some effect in the initial catarrhal stage. We sometimes use some anesthetics, but they can block the mucus and cause terrible pneumonia and breathing difficulties. We sometimes use sedatives, but they often cause the child to become drowsy. Not only are the child's parents very worried, but they often also lead to a dependency on the injection (Acthercum Oleum Ollvarum Lcc).</p>
<p>It is very effective for coughs in pertussis. I have tested it and the results are very satisfactory. If a pertussis patient is injected in the afternoon or evening, then the patient can definitely have a longer period of sleep at night. This medicine is produced in Germany, France, and also in China. Inject once a day, one cc each time (two cc for adults), intramuscular injection. This medicine has a small shortcoming, that is, it is very painful when injected, and there is inevitable discomfort within two or three minutes.</p>
<h3>Free Vaccination Injections (Reported by this Newspaper)</h3>
<h3>Medical Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Answered by Dr. Liang Houqing</p>
<p>Your bold and uninhibited "will to live" is truly admirable! However, I must honestly tell you that a person is, after all, a person. No matter what, we cannot treat ourselves as test subjects to test unproven drugs. If side effects that endanger your life occur due to the use of drugs, then you will regret it too late. Therefore, I advise you never to take such a big risk to try. Although you said that after taking "Sutolipan" for three months, many symptoms have been reduced and your appetite has improved, this "Sutolipan" drug is still in the experimental stage, and the Health Bureau has banned its sale (and many patients have reported failures after taking this drug). It can be seen that the efficacy of this drug still needs to be further tested and cannot be considered perfect. Also, as I mentioned before, chaulmoogra oil has the effect of treating laryngeal tuberculosis; this is just a report provided for everyone's reference. But after you saw this news, you immediately tried it, and bought chaulmoogra in Chinese medicine to grind into powder and take internally, regardless of whether it has toxins that harm the body and side effects that stimulate the stomach. This bold approach is truly shocking to hear.</p>
<p>What is admirable is that your bold attempts may provide some valuable dawn for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis! I also said in the Q&amp;A column in the previous issue: "The properties of tubercle bacilli and leprosy bacilli are very similar. Because chaulmoogra has a very therapeutic effect on leprosy, Dr. Li Gang and I have tried it on laryngeal tuberculosis (because laryngeal tuberculosis is surgical, and using chaulmoogra oil to apply to the affected area can reduce its toxicity or side effects), and the result is considered very effective, so it is made public so that patients can discuss the application of this method with their attending physician according to their condition. However, you boldly bought chaulmoogra in Chinese medicine to grind into powder and take it internally. Fortunately, you did not poison yourself, and you also benefited from it. This is truly a miracle! If the medical community can continue to study and find a special medicine for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, then you are the greatest adventurer."</p>
<p>Regarding dietary health, I think you still have to pay attention to it carefully. All hard and indigestible foods are on the prohibited list. You must take easily digestible and nutritious foods for a long time. Vitamins A, B, and C are even more indispensable. If it is practically possible, you may wish to inject a large amount of glucose, calcium, and vitamins C and B. If you can treat and heal for a long time and lie still for a long time, then your disease can be cured.</p>
<p>Finally, I must incidentally tell the readers; "The condition described by Ye Jiewu Jun and the treatment methods I provided are only for everyone's reference. I hope everyone will not blindly follow them!" As for the internal use of "Sturitolimexin" that you mentioned, I think it is wrong because it completely loses its effectiveness after being used as an internal preparation, so why spend so much money (each bottle is worth more than 400,000 legal currency) to do something that is useless?

<h3>To Jie in the Collapsed Da Feng Steamer</h3>
<p>— Xu Xun</p>
<p>Jie: Today marks six days since you left home. For us, these are days as long as many years! Thinking of you, all I can do is weep.</p>
<p>Jie, I never imagined that our first separation after marriage would be a final farewell. Didn’t you say that you would be back in no more than three days? Yet, six days have passed, and you are still nowhere to be seen. Today, the bleak wind and bitter rain continue. Where are you, drifting about?</p>
<p>In the past two days, during my moments of confusion, I often believed that you would return. I imagined you being swept by the waves to a sandy beach, where a kind old fisherman would rescue you. One day, you would suddenly appear at the door, wearing ill-fitting clothes. Thus, whenever I heard footsteps outside the door, I thought it was you. Although I could discern that it wasn’t you, I couldn't help but raise my head to look out, even though all I saw was emptiness.</p>
<p>These past few days, I've received no news of you anywhere. Jie, I no longer have the courage to hope for your survival. Others try to comfort me by saying, "Maybe you were rescued by a sailboat." But what are the chances of that happening, even one in ten million? You can't swim, and you're not physically strong. Even if you had a wooden board, you couldn't possibly hold on for long. Moreover, although young, you had such a detached view of life and death that you might not even struggle desperately. And you were meticulous. If you had safely reached another place by sailboat, even if you couldn't return immediately, surely a letter would have arrived by now.</p>
<p>It was because you were afraid of the Hangli steamer that you took the Da Feng. Who knew that it was many times older than you, its machinery long obsolete, its hull long decayed, and that it should have been taken out of service long ago? Moreover, when the Yongzhang oil tanker signaled for help, none of the crew members could understand the flags. How could such a ship still be allowed to sail? Jie, you were innocent. It is the corruption of the maritime administration and the profiteering of unscrupulous merchants that caused you all to be unjustly submerged at the bottom of the river. The passengers who escaped said that many people were simply locked in the cabins, with no chance of survival. Now, the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Association has risen to uphold justice and properly handle the aftermath. Jie, rest in peace. Soon, your grievances will surely be brought to light. If you cannot obtain redress, then countless others will continue to suffer.</p>
<p>You left in such a hurry to see your father, who was ill. On the afternoon of the eighth, you hadn't yet planned to return. After going to your second sister's house and learning about your father's serious illness, you immediately bought medicine and decided to return to say goodbye. To catch the steamer that night, you left in such a hurry. I poured you a cup of tea, but you didn't even wait for it to cool before taking your clothes and leaving. You didn't want me to tire myself out, so you wouldn't let me see you downstairs. I saw you to the door, wanting to take you to the pier, but you refused. It wasn't your first time traveling back and forth between the north and south of the Yangtze, so I let you go alone without much worry. At the door, watching your back disappear into the alleyway, I turned around and went upstairs to sleep soundly. In the middle of the night, the storm woke me up. I only thought that you were wearing such thin clothes and would catch a cold tomorrow. On the morning of the ninth, the wind and rain were even heavier. Around seven o'clock, on my way to school, I thought, "You probably won't disembark at Rengang. You must be going to Tianshengang." I was worried about whether you would catch a cold and get sick, so I immediately wrote a letter to Nantong, never knowing that you would never see it.</p>
<p>You boarded the ship around ten o'clock, and it is said that the wind on the Bund was already very strong at that time. Your heart was set on going home, and you insisted on leaving. Now, I only hate myself for not seeing you off. Usually, I cared about every little thing about you, but this time I was so careless and negligent. If I had seen you to the pier and seen how treacherous the wind was and how high the waves were on the river, I would have kept you from going. It was I who let you go alone, which led to this unexpected tragedy. Jie, I will regret this for the rest of my life, and I will never be able to ask for your forgiveness.</p>
<p>Jie, you were such a filial son to your aging father. That year, when the puppet army arrested him, you went to take his place. Usually, when your father had a minor illness, you couldn't sleep or eat in peace, let alone now that he is seriously ill. You also loved children so much, no wonder your nephews and nieces all adored you. Every time you went to your second sister's house, the first thing you did was hug her little Shanghai. Three months ago, we returned to Nantong together, carrying many things. You were mindful of the safety of the fetus, and when going up and down the piers, you not only carried things yourself but also supported me, telling me to be careful. When I went out to take the streetcar, you would always say, "Be careful, don't squeeze on if it's too crowded." When I was tired from doing things, you would ask, "Are you comfortable?" Your heart was filled with the joy of becoming a father. Who would have thought that by the time the child was born, he would no longer see his loving father? Some people feel sorry for me because of this, but I am grateful that you left me this little memento. When you left, you said, "Come home early after school, don't squeeze on the streetcar, and take good care of the child." We both laughed when you said the last sentence. Who would have thought that a joke would become a prophecy, and that it would be your only will? Now, what you are most concerned about is still your father and your child. I will serve your father as you would have done. I bought the medicine he needs yesterday. I will also do my best to raise this child who is about to be born to comfort you—the father who suffered misfortune for his grandfather. We had wanted to give him a good name. Now, no matter what the sound is like, I want to name him "June Ninth." On the one hand, to commemorate his grandfather's sixty-ninth birthday this year, and also to commemorate the day of your tragic event, June 9th!</p>
<p>Jie, I never imagined that our separation in life would be so tragic, and that our separation in death would be so swift! Everyone who knows us feels saddened, and even my students are shedding tears. We had even dreamed of celebrating our silver and gold wedding anniversaries one day, but who knew that we would only be together for nine months? In the ci poem you wrote on our wedding night, you said, "The journey is long, let us steer the helm together from today." Who knew that our boat of shared life would not even reach halfway before I was left to sail alone? Originally, a person's life and death are not a big deal, especially in this era, it is even more common. But you were too young, you were only twenty-three years old; you would have graduated from Jiaotong University in one year, but what you learned could not be put to use—and you left so suddenly, so tragically. I doubt myself that I am dreaming. I don’t believe that someone as upright and pure as you would be swallowed by the waves.</p>
<p>Jie, have you come home to see me these past few days? But I haven't been able to bring myself to go back. I can't bear to look at anything in the house. Every item is filled with deep memories, and whenever I see them, tears well up in my eyes.</p>
<p>My older brother and brother-in-law have been running around all day, but I no longer have the courage or strength. Jie, I only ask that I find you soon, so that I can see your face one last time, so that I can prostrate myself beside you, cry bitterly, and lay you to rest in a place where you can sleep peacefully. From now on, I can only imagine that you are a traveler far away, wandering in an unknown foreign land. Though near, yet so far, may we meet in my dreams, may we reunite after my death. Following this letter, I will continue to write to you to entrust my unentrustable emotions and to comfort your lonely heart.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I found some of your books, manuscripts, and letters at my second sister's house. I didn't think much of them when they were lost before, but now they are so precious. When I am in a better mood, I will organize them together with the things at home. Jie, your soul will live on with these things, and you will always live in my heart, in the hearts of many relatives and friends. I'll talk to you again, Jie. (June 14th)</p>
<h3>Symphony in White</h3>
<p>— Hui Sile</p>
<p>Hui Sile (J. Whistler 1834-1903) was not a truly British painter. Because he lived in Britain, historians included him in British art history. Throughout his life, he yearned for the East, and his style was rich in Eastern sentiment. His colors had a musical effect, and his painting titles often used musical terms. For example, this painting, in which a white-clad woman leans against a white stone fireplace mantel, he named "Symphony in White." Other representative works include "Arrangement in Grey and Black" (i.e., the portrait of his mother), "Nocturne in Blue and Gold," etc. These works were met with ridicule and mockery at the time, but today they have become world-famous masterpieces and are treasured in the British Royal Art Museum. Liu Shi</p>
<h3>Offering</h3>
<p>— Mo Qin</p>
<p>When the trumpet creeper once again flashes its blood-red flowers, it will have been a full year since you passed away.</p>
<p>A few sprigs of snapdragons, your favorite flower in life, several bouquets of fresh flowers, and a sincere incense offering have all been brought to your grave. This is all I can do for you now.</p>
<p>You let others bury you, but why didn't you take my thoughts with you? Your voice and smile constantly and deeply pierce my memory. I will not forget these harmonies of life. Yes, I know that I caused you some unhappiness in life, but a reasonable person like you, a wise person like you, must understand my true feelings. If you didn't think of it the way I did, let me state myself again here.</p>
<p>I have never had the desire to live long. I have only been in this world for over twenty years, but the coldness of humanity has already chilled my heart. So-called happiness is merely a patch of cloud in the sky during the rainy season. The appearance of these clouds is merely a prelude to the coming storm. Once the storm passes, they dissipate. Before the smile after grasping happiness has subsided, one is already crying for destruction. Why let human affairs play with our emotions? Limited joy is the source of infinite sorrow. Therefore, I don't want others to enter my circle of life. Wouldn't it be better for me to swallow my pain alone? Life is merely a debt. By using up years, and enduring all kinds of ancient difficulties, one can find peace. I cannot create happiness for others, so what reason do I have to ask others to share my pain? You said you could make me happy, and of course I trust you. However, I don't trust 'happiness' itself. In order to avoid future troubles, let happiness live forever in fantasy. Therefore, I did not accept your offer. I don't need to explain in words how much my heart hurt when I silently met your doubtful and condemning gaze. Let time be my witness. Who knew, who knew that you would live even shorter than I did? You ultimately couldn't wait for my explanation!</p>
<p>When you finished your studies and went to the mainland, at the pier, I said a lot to your gloomy face: "Be more open-minded, don't be too narrow-minded in your feelings; too narrow-minded feelings will only cause pain, and it's not clever to take life too seriously; change your goals, change your path, and it may make you more fortunate. Lift your head up and give me a bright smile! We will always, always be good friends." You smiled and waved your handkerchief as expected, and I reluctantly felt relieved and smiled with you. I never thought that this would be the last time I would see your smile, and that this smile would turn into tears.</p>
<p>Along the way, you told me about many of the situations along the way, and even wrote down the strange customs in a relaxed style. This was my comfort. I felt at peace and joyful, as if I had been pardoned. You arrived at the mountain city, and you had a good job. Naturally, you had your well-positioned father there, and your path wouldn't be too rugged. You said you often played poker and stayed up all night in clubs; you also attended parties, you drank alcohol, and smoked cigarettes. I was really worried about your drinking. Also, these behaviors were very different from your habit of loving snapdragons. How much I hoped that you could maintain that simple, unadorned nature of the past.</p>
<p>I hoped that you would live a regular life, I hoped that you would walk your own path well, and I hoped even more that you would find a fellow traveler and develop a satisfying living environment. I hoped and hoped, but thousands of hopes fell through! You came back, and what came back was a soulless body. After receiving the news of your father's setting up a memorial altar for you, I didn't have the courage to come to pay my respects. How could I bear to see your father's white hair and your mother's tearful eyes? Your younger sister also gave me a resentful look. Of course, I don't blame her at all. She wouldn't understand my original intention. The affection between siblings always outweighs the friendship between classmates. Whenever I saw the black gauze on her arm, I always lowered my head in pain. In order to avoid future misfortune, I created a deeper trauma instead. I let the emotions I held back destroy your life. If I had known this, I shouldn't have been so selfish. How do you want me to wash away this guilt in my heart?</p>
<p>The flowering crabapple in Kaiyuan Temple is blooming again, and the new lotus in Canglang Pavilion has sprouted through the water. However, there are no longer any traces of our travels here. The color of my youthful smiles has faded. In order to atone for you, I am willing to endure all kinds of punishments.</p>
<p>You weren't lonely when you were alive, and you aren't after death; life must be repaid with life. Then, give me another bright smile! (June, the thirty-fifth year)</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Chen Pei</p>
<p>The room began to darken. I put down my pen and stared out the window in a daze.</p>
<p>How many days, on that misty river, a faint new moon lined the blue sky, hazily covering the distant mountains, the water flowed, the wind sang, and the boats dreamed silently... I! A wanderer, spending several dusks.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I had abandoned that life on the water, accompanied by a pen, a few sheets of paper, letting the dusk carry loneliness, gnawing at a bleak heart.</p>
<p>Reminiscence</p>
<p>Under the lamp at dusk, facing a dried peach blossom, I unfolded my reminiscence.</p>
<p>I brought it from the distant Jialing River, and now it has been two years, and I still keep it.</p>
<p>It brought me a string of dim days, and it also brought me the labor of daytime, and even more, it brought me many poems, in these full two years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it can also allow the light of my thoughts to shine on my beautiful girl, think about the rising moon, and send distant reminiscence.</p>
<p>Ox</p>
<p>I dreamed: I turned into an ox,</p>
<p>Running laboriously, panting heavily, whip on the back, sweat on the face, until I died.</p>
<p>Awake! I thought: Those who control people and those who are controlled, the dreams of the day and the dreams of the night, are the same.</p>
<p>Life is originally an ox plowing life! Ah!</p>
<h3>Musical Quotes</h3>

<p>Music is one of the most effective tools for influencing human reason and spirit. (Gladstone)</p>
<h3>Song and Dance Girls of the Tang Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Dong Meikan</p>
<p>The Li Tang dynasty inherited the song and dance of the previous dynasties, and created many new tunes. The musical and song parts of dramas became more complete in this dynasty. Because Emperor Gaozu of Tang followed the old system of the Sui dynasty and used nine music ensembles at the beginning of the Wude period, and later set up the Jiaofang (music bureau) in the forbidden palace, which was responsible for teaching music and managing the actors and musicians. Emperor Taizong established the Ten Music Ensembles of Hao Yanle, and the sounds and lyrics tended to be complex. There were fourteen modes and two hundred and twenty-two tunes recorded. In the second year of the Kaiyuan period of Emperor Xuanzong, this music-loving emperor set up the Jiaofang next to the Penglai Palace, and set up left and right Jiaofang in the capital, dividing the music into sitting and standing departments. There were eight standing performance teams and six sitting performance teams. The Jiaofang system continued until the Yongzheng period of the Qing dynasty before it was abolished. In addition, Emperor Xuanzong also set up the Liyuan (Pear Garden) to teach actors and musicians with eleven short-piece songs and twenty Yunshao songs.</p>
<p>Emperor Xuanzong not only loved music and promoted it, but he was also a musician himself. Wang Dang of the Song dynasty said in his "Tang Yulin":</p>
<p>"Emperor Xuanzong was proficient in music, both in string and wind instruments, all of which he mastered with great skill. He created many tunes at will, as if without effort; he especially loved the jieqi and horizontal flute, and said that the eight tones were the leaders, and other music could not compare with them..."</p>
<p>Therefore, he cannot be compared with those emperors who encouraged song and dance only because they loved entertainment. There were many measures related to this at the time, of which the establishment of Jiaofang and Liyuan was naturally the most important. In the early Tang dynasty, all elegant and popular music was under the jurisdiction of the Taichang Temple, which managed rituals for the imperial ancestral temples. In the second year of Kaiyuan, Emperor Xuanzong designated Taichang as the Ritual and Music Department, which was a more solemn official office and should not manage actors and musicians. Therefore, he set up the left and right Jiaofang next to the Penglai Palace, and each had its own specialty.</p>
<p>Cui Lingqing of the Tang dynasty wrote in his "Jiaofang Ji": "The Right Jiaofang of Xijing is located in Guangzhai Fang, and the Left Jiaofang is located in Yanzheng Fang. The right side is good at singing, and the left side is good at dancing, which is a habit..."</p>
<p>From these words, it can be inferred that the Jiaofang situation at that time must have been that one side specialized in teaching singing and the other side specialized in teaching dancing. In the Jiaofang, most of them were beginners called "zongtan jia" (all-around players). It seems that the Liyuan had a bit of a comprehensive teaching nature. The Jiaofang and Liyuan were certainly the same thing, but perhaps there was a distinction between elementary and advanced levels. If this guess is correct, I believe that the Jiaofang was the elementary level, teaching ordinary palace women ordinary singing and dancing skills; while the Liyuan was the advanced level, concentrating some palace women who already had expertise or some who had particularly good qualities, and Emperor Xuanzong himself taught them. Would the female musicians of the Jiaofang only be called Liyuan disciples after they had been promoted in rank? According to what is recorded in the Treatise on Ritual and Music in the Book of Tang, it seems to contain this kind of meaning. The book says;</p>
<p>"Emperor Ming knew music and loved Faqu. He selected three hundred disciples of the sitting performance team to teach in the Liyuan. If there was any error in the sound, the emperor would be able to correct it. They were called Emperor's Liyuan disciples. Several hundred palace women were also called Liyuan disciples, and they lived in the Liyuan of Yichun Courtyard."</p>
<p>The same book also says: "In the eleventh year of Kaiyuan, Shengshou Music was first created, and women were ordered to wear clothes of five colors to sing and dance. The female teachers of Yichun Courtyard could perform on stage in one day, but the zongtan jia could not complete it in a month. On the day of the performance, the emperor ordered the people of Yichun Courtyard to be the beginning and end, and the zongtan jia to be in the middle, learning their gestures..."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that there was a difference in skill between the zongtan jia and the Liyuan disciples. I think it was also the difference in the ranks of Jiaofang and Liyuan. There were many musical pieces sung and danced at that time, but it is impossible to say for sure whether there were as many as Bai Juyi exaggerated, "thousands of songs and ten thousand dances are uncountable," which is unbelievable. The "Tang Liudian" and "Wenxian Tongkao" recorded more than fifty pieces. Therefore, each performance must first advance the names of the pieces for selection, because there were too many, and they could not all be performed completely. The "Jiaofang Ji" says:</p>
<p>"Whenever a song is performed, the officials must first advance the name of the piece. The emperor dances to the ones marked with ink, and not to the ones not marked. The advance of the tune is called jindian ri. When the inner musicians perform the dance, the Jiaofang people can only dance Yizhou Wutian Chonglai Die, and they cannot leave these two pieces. All the rest is left to the inner people." (The same book says: "When a prostitute enters Yichun Courtyard, she is called 'inner person,' or 'front person,' because she is always in front.")</p>
<p>Moreover, the scale of the songs and dances at that time was also very large, with as many as nine hundred people in some cases, and no fewer than one hundred and forty people in others. The Old Book of Tang's Musical History once said: "In the first month of the second year of Changshou, Empress Wu Zetian personally offered sacrifices at the Wuxiang Temple. Before this, she had created the Great Music of the Divine Palace, and the dance used nine hundred people. At this time, they danced in the courtyard of the Divine Palace." It also said: "Shengshou Music was composed by Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu. The dancers numbered one hundred and forty people." Using so many people cannot really be considered a lot before the Tianbao era. Du Fu said: "The late emperor's palace maids numbered eight thousand," and Bai Juyi said: "The harem had three thousand beauties." The New Book of Tang also said that there were probably forty thousand people. Then, there were at least the number Bai said, and selecting nearly a thousand people from several thousand beauties can still be considered a careful selection.</p>

<h3>The Forgotten Island - Ryukyu</h3>
<p>— Ya Yi Translation</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, there were calls throughout the country to "return Ryukyu." Ryukyu is indeed the eastern wall of our country. Didn't Japan first jump over this wall before looking for a way to break in? Didn't the US military pay the price of 35,000 casualties in Okinawa? Its importance can be imagined. Recently, it is said that Japan has requested to co-manage the islands with the United States. When the Chinese people heard this, they were outraged. The status of Ryukyu is still being decided. We have a layer of separation from Ryukyu, which has been away from the embrace of the motherland for sixty or seventy years. Furthermore, domestic reporters rarely go there to report, so I will give a brief introduction:</p>
<p>The fierce battle fought by the US military in the southern part of Okinawa two years ago still leaves a trail of wreckage behind. In Naha, there used to be 65,000 people, and foreign trade was still fairly developed. Today, it is also covered with rubble. There are two military highways connecting it to the US military bases on the island.</p>
<p>In the northern mountains, it is believed that many small numbers of scattered Japanese soldiers are still hiding. Venturing into old bases, broken walls, or other dangerous places often results in being killed by Japanese landmines or traps.</p>
<p>Organized Japanese forces were wiped out after eighty-two days of fierce fighting, until June 11, 1945. In that battle, the US military suffered 15,000 deaths and more than 20,000 injuries, including the commander of the US Tenth Army, General Buckner, and a war correspondent, Bell.</p>
<p>For two years, no better houses have been built. The US military lives in temporary huts, while hundreds of thousands of natives live in shacks that are unfit for human habitation. They only eat food that the United States shipped in previously, because there is a lack of fertilizer, fishing boats, and other equipment.</p>
<p>The officials in Washington who will determine the fate of the island are now paying attention to the situation in Europe.</p>
<p>"Post-war Okinawa has been forgotten," a local US leader told a reporter. "When a senior official happens to fly from Washington to Tokyo or Shanghai and passes through this place, he may say that Okinawa has no strategic value to the United States, but unexpectedly, he doesn't say anything."</p>
<p>US military leaders are unwilling to make public statements, but it is clear that they all hope to clarify the status of the island and announce the plans set by the United States as soon as possible. The local government has done its best, but its effectiveness has not been great due to a lack of funds and limited authority. Several coral roads have been completed, and the wartime airport is being improved and expanded. Furthermore, there are already many wooden houses to supply US military families who are permitted to come here.</p>
<p>The most glorious place on the island, and the one that busy traveling reporters cannot visit, is the five large tombs of the martyrs. That pure place shows their bravery and heroism even more. The majority of loyal souls will forever sleep in a foreign land, and the troops stationed on the island can also be proud to guard these loyal remains.</p>
<p>"These martyrs are forever accusing us, the most sympathetic accusation." An old military officer said to me: "We feel that the majority of brave young men, if they have souls, must think that this place is the best place, and we are certain that this place will become a permanent American shrine."</p>
<h3>Adventure at Yangguan - Story Three of Hasa</h3>
<p>— Piao Yuan</p>
<p>Hasa is a Muslim. I don’t know why, but he seems to have a deep hatred for Muslims in the interior. He doesn’t touch them unless necessary, but when he does, he kills them!</p>
<p>In the 31st year of the Republic of China, Lei Yuchen, an alumnus of the Art Academy, went to Dunhuang with the Northwest Cultural Relics Investigation Team. Because of the investigation, he wanted to go near Yangguan. The county magistrate of Dunhuang said: "That won't work, right? There are Hasa tribesmen there!" Lei-Jun, perhaps in addition to adventuring for the Northwest cultural relics, he may have been planning to take a chance for the frontier ethnic groups. He must go. The county magistrate had no choice but to send four armed policemen and a surveying staff member to go with him.</p>
<p>“Sure enough,” Lei Jun said with wide eyes, as if he saw the Hasa coming from afar, “We had been there for not long. We were laughing to ourselves, laughing at those who had intentionally exaggerated. Weren’t we coming? Where? Where are the Hasa?” Hey, someone yelled out, yelling so scary, saying the Hasa were coming, bang, bang, bang... Before I even had time to see, the police who came with us opened fire, and already, one was injured and one was dead!”</p>
<p>"At this time, it seemed that I also saw that there were three or four horses behind, with people with bird feathers in their heads sitting on the horses. There's no question, these were really the Hasa! The police were still fighting them, and we ran! Ran, ran, ran so hard that we couldn't catch our breath, didn't stop at all, all four policemen were killed, and three Hasa horses had already caught up! Bang, bang, bang, they kept shooting from behind. I thought: It's over, I'm going to die this time no matter what!"</p>
<p>"Fortunately, I only knew one sentence of Hasa language! Seeing that they had already caught up, and the surveyor had been knocked down by them, I didn't care about anything, raised my hand and said in Hasa: "I am a Han Chinese!" I don't know if it was the effect of this sentence, or if the camera that my companion was carrying attracted their attention. I seemed to see them get off their horses and walk towards my companion. I didn't care about life and death and ran away in a flash!"</p>
<p>After Mr. Lei finished speaking, he let out a long breath, as if those three Hasa had just run away.</p>
<p>These stories made me believe that the Hasa, though they have a stupid and ugly appearance, have a smart and beautiful soul; if they can be properly educated, they will have their golden age.</p>
<h3>A Small Teacher's Life</h3>
<p>— Han Guang</p>
<p>On June 3rd, I read a dispatch from Shou County in a certain newspaper, about Sun Jianru, a Chinese language teacher at Shou County Middle School, who wrote a couplet: "Deceiving ghosts with writings, cheating people with career; shouting on the streets is but a begging life." I couldn't help but feel deeply moved; hence, I picked this topic to write about trivial matters.</p>
<p>I am currently working as a primary school teacher in a certain town in northern Jiangsu. Since the beginning of the semester until now, it has been over four months, and I have only received 50,000 yuan and two shi and eight dou of rice. I have a wife and a child at home, and the seven necessities of life are all indispensable. We have been out of rice for a long time, relying solely on borrowing money to survive. Unable to borrow, we have no choice but to sell our belongings. The day before yesterday, after discussing it with my wife again and again, we reluctantly sold our wedding souvenir: a good mirror and two new chairs, at a low price, for a total of 48,000 yuan. Yesterday, I bought over twenty jin of firewood and one dou of wheat, which has already used up half; the rest, I can see, will soon be used up. If I have to sell again, there is only a leather suitcase for clothes left. But, how much can it be worth? And how many more days can it support us?</p>
<h3>Overpopulation</h3>
<p>— Dan Meng</p>
<p>Malthus's explanation of the population problem is generally considered to have explored the secrets of mankind. However, his conclusion is very pessimistic, and not only temporarily pessimistic but eternally pessimistic, expressing the most irresistible depression about the fate and destination of the entire human race. Since he established this theory, a shadow of terror has been planted among all nations, and psychologically they have never been able to relax. At the same time, inherited wars and famines seem to prove it. For half a century, this has been a fact that people have hesitated to deny, making wisdom and power feel useless and incapable.</p>
<p>China's vast land and abundant resources have comparatively diminished in value today. The only thing that can still be boasted about is its large population, which reminds people of the genius Malthus and his worrying theory.</p>
<p>Before our eyes, a series of unpleasant scenes are erupting and spreading. Unemployment, displacement, suicide, and even abandoned houses, commodity prices, and other problems are mostly believed to be due to the severely harmful effects of population size. From countless symptoms, some believe that besides Malthus's explanation, it seems that we have grasped the crux of our circle, and it is difficult to find other reasons.</p>
<p>Therefore, the followers or admirers of Sanger are calling out with compassion to good men and women, advocating birth control, saying that this is a necessary measure to care for the second generation. But in this difficult environment, besides a small number of people who are well-fed and comfortable and can still reproduce their "excellent" children, most people are probably already regarding childbirth as the most frightening misfortune in life. The rates of infanticide and abortion in China remain high.</p>
<p>Furthermore, judging from the recent rice-snatching incidents in various places, we cannot help but wonder whether it is overpopulation or the isolation of the population from food supplies that has caused these tragedies. Magnificent garden mansions are only inhabited by one family and their servants, while each person in the poor people's burrows has only three or four square meters of space. Shops in China are stocked with goods or clothing and other necessities, but there is a lack of sales channels, and even scantily clad women and children fill the streets. Is it overpopulation? China's population density is not higher than that of certain wealthy countries.</p>
<p>Resisting Malthus's theory is "mutual aid theory," which is optimistic and gives hope to humanity, and even more gives people cooperation in line with the future. If we continue to use overpopulation as an excuse and allow all kinds of unfair evils to continue, it is shameful, and this is not a reason for mankind to evade responsibility. We should say that the population is not excessive, but the spirit of mutual aid among the population has not been fully developed. Malthus, a defender of human misdeeds, must not introduce his fallacy into our already unfortunate circle!</p>
<h3>Zhu Manhua's screenplay, He Tong's direction, Variety Department One's new film "Lucky Star Highlighting" starring Lin Bin.</h3>
<h3>The New Imperial Envoy: An Interesting Play about Meixian, Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Dong Liu</p>
<p>When Gogol wrote "The Government Inspector," he certainly had a basis. This satirical play exposed the truth of the officialdom of 19th-century Tsarist Russia. Its effect may not be less than China's "A Record of Officialdom Exposed." Comparing Gogol's realistic technique with Li Boyuan is somewhat inappropriate, but the attitude between the two is somewhat similar: both hold a burst of grief and indignation in their laughter and scolding.</p>
<p>In the real society of China, interesting dramas similar to "The Government Inspector" have often occurred recently. A barber-like person, blinded by money, fantasized and even invited a few tea servers and mud workers to northern Jiangsu to impersonate "commissioners." This news caused a sensation last year. There was also a dismissed staff member of the Salt Affairs Bureau in Hangzhou who borrowed the business card of a certain director, and went around spreading rumors and swindling, saying that he was about to become the county magistrate of a certain county. Whoever was willing to pay a certain amount of money, he could appoint them to official positions such as "section chief" and "director." He also had a letter of introduction from the celebrity Shen Junru, and his conversation was also quite elegant, so quite a few people were deceived. Similar news, once published, was always titled "'New Imperial Envoy' Appears," which shows that Gogol's satirical play is very familiar to Chinese intellectuals.</p>
<p>Recently, a Guangzhou correspondent of Ta Kung Pao provided another story about a "new imperial envoy." Although the incident is ordinary, it is also very typical. It turns out that there was a person named Zhang Xuehong, who was originally a retired staff member of the Personnel Section of the Guangdong Provincial Government. Not long ago, he arrived in Meizhou with two fashionable girls, claiming to be an inspector from the Personnel Department of the Provincial Government. Yang Youmin, the Speaker of the local county council, wanted to take this opportunity to sue the Meixian County Magistrate. He held a grand banquet, inviting local gentry to accompany him. After the banquet, he handed over a secret letter to Zhang "inspector" to be forwarded to Chairman Luo Zhuoying, and gifted him travel expenses. Unexpectedly, the county government had also learned that the provincial inspector was visiting the county, so it could not help but quickly make some new arrangements, preparing to receive him. If someone had not discovered that the two girls Zhang "inspector" brought were originally famous local prostitutes from Xingning County, our "inspector adult" would have had many more days of happiness. Unfortunately, clowns are only suitable for playing five-cent roles. When the matter was exposed, the "inspector adult" had no choice but to be imprisoned.</p>
<p>Realistic satirical plays, although based on real stories, still have exaggeration, emphasis, and criticism. However, in the hands of artistic masters, this exaggeration and emphasis are not noticed by ordinary people. In fact, in Gogol's eyes, "Inspector Zhang" of Meixian is a very humorous figure. He has unwittingly revealed the secret of bureaucracy prevalent in China with his personal account.</p>
<p>What is strange is not only the "inspector adult's" flaunting of prostitutes, but why did Speaker Yang want to "hold a grand banquet" and even "gift travel expenses"? If the Meixian County Magistrate really had illegal behavior, as the Speaker, he could follow judicial procedures and file a lawsuit. If it was just for a little personal grudge, wouldn't the Speaker's banquet and travel expenses become the object of people's criticism? On the other hand, the Meixian County Magistrate did not start from the aspect of governing, but when he heard that the "inspector" was coming, he "quickly made some new arrangements, preparing to receive him." It can also be said that he was deeply poisoned by bureaucracy. In this report, the most embarrassing figures are the two local prostitutes from Xingning County, and the most novel feeling is also for these two prostitutes. Just imagine how respectful they were of the officialdom at first. When they discovered that there were such muddled things in the officialdom, wouldn't they turn from "astonishment" to a mocking smile?</p>
<h3>Butcher</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaonan</p>
<p>On June 17th, Langmi Cun Chunxi of Changshu was executed by shooting in Shanghai, sending condolences to Mr. Gong Qiren, who suffered greatly from the wolf disaster. The short bandit did not know this day of his death. Tens of thousands of people emptied the streets to butcher the wolf; the blood debt of Yushan was finally settled, and he should regret his tyranny in those years.</p>
<h3>Plastic Music Cries</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>It is obvious that what is called plastic here is the kind of material made of plastic that has been popular all over the world in recent years. Because most of them are as transparent as glass, we call them plastic. Some people think that calling plastic glass is a bit "old-fashioned." In fact, this name is not unique to Chinese people, even the most fashionable Americans have this name themselves.</p>
<p>Let's say that in 1939 there was a steel musician and band leader named Billy Glass who went to visit the New York World's Fair. In the "Glass Palace," the crystal products made him amazed. Therefore, he suddenly had an idea that if there was an orchestra, all of whose instruments were made of glass, and led by a musician named Glass, how interesting would that be? He dreamed of a "Billy Glass's Glass Symphony Orchestra," and visited plastic manufacturers and musical instrument companies, hoping that they could manufacture this kind of instrument, but they regarded it as absurd and ridiculous and ignored it.</p>
<p>But Mr. Glass persevered. He bought many glass raw materials himself and hid in the kitchen to start manufacturing. He used a high heat of two to fifty degrees to create the first violin. The sound of this plastic violin is comparable to that of a wooden one, its only disadvantage being that the volume seems less rich. After that, he manufactured five more violins, as well as other guitars, trumpets, drums, and other instruments. Hollywood and manufacturers began to become interested in these plastic instruments, but it will probably take considerable time and improvement for these instruments to become popular and replace wooden Stradivarius violins.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Old Zhu was really taken aback. When he pressed the water bottle to Feifei's mouth again, both of his hands were trembling violently. In this desolate wilderness where there was no one around, and the time was close to midnight, no matter how brave he was, he couldn't help but worry about the child's illness.</p>
<p>Later, Feifei took a few sips of water, which finally made Old Zhu breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>He calmed down and thought: According to the old villager, it was only twenty-four li from Guanxi to Nandan if you took this shortcut. Even if you add some, and count it as thirty li, then he must have walked at least half of it. If he walked faster, he could probably finish the other half in three hours. Judging from Feifei's current condition, it was really necessary to get to Nandan as soon as possible. So he stood up without hesitation, first took out the more valuable and necessary small items in the box one by one, and stuffed them randomly into every pocket of his clothes and pants. He decided not to take the remaining items and the leather suitcase, because he dared not let Feifei rest on his back again. He was prepared to carry her in both hands and "walk on the road."</p>
<p>He ran desperately on the dirt road like a defeated soldier, while also having to lower his head from time to time to pay attention to Feifei in his arms.</p>
<p>Feifei seemed to have fallen asleep again. Old Zhu gently took the bronze male rabbit from her hand, fearing that such a heavy thing would damage Feifei's heart.</p>
<p>He hid the steel rabbit and tried his best to cheer up, walking one step at a time; sweat drenched his whole body. He would occasionally free up his right hand, randomly pull out something from his pocket or pants pocket - maybe it was a undershirt, or even pants, he had no time to distinguish - and wipe his face and neck randomly.</p>
<p>The time was already past midnight.</p>
