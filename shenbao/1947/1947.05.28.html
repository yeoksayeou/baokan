<h3>召宴國民黨籍參政員　蔣總裁致懇摯訓詞　闡明企求和平初衷不變</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國民黨蔣總裁，廿七日下午七時半就勵志社召寔全體國民黨參政員，出席百餘人，席間蔣總裁首致誠懇委婉之談話，並强調政府對和平之渴望從朱放棄，當努力促其實現。其次，對於軍事問題，認為戰局有所進展，經濟問題，則對於經濟緊急措施方案之施行技術有所檢討，旋復有甫自徐返抵京之陳誠出席，報吿軍事，至九時許始散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕蔣總裁廿七晚在召宴國民黨籍參政員席間，曾致簡短訓詞，略謂：國家經過八年抗戰，絕對需要和平，政府為達此目的，自抗戰勝利以來，即本寬大容忍的精神，作繼續不斷的努力，但和平之能否實現，完全繫於共產黨的態度，亦即在共產黨是否能以國家·人民為重，而表示其謀取和平的誠意，在政府方面，若有一綫和平之希望，決不改變企求和平的初衷，希各位共同有此認識。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕參政會討論和平提案之前夕，行政院長張羣於廿七日下午六時許，邀請梁漱溟·章伯鈞·許德珩·何基鴻·范子遂·江恒源·王孟鄰·朱益淸等十人商談，徵詢渠等對和平問題之意見。據聞：梁等十人於晤張前，曾作硏討，渠等意見廿七日夜由張羣向蔣主席報吿並請示，然後轉答梁等。廿八日之全體審查委會，渠等仍照常出席，蔣主席並定廿八午宴梁許等有所晤談。</p>
<p>參會電毛澤東等　請來京共策國是</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕參政會大會致中共參政員邀諧來京出席之電文，廿六日晚十二時已先由中央廣播電台播出，該電係根據廿六日大會所通過之蕭一山等一百人之臨時緊急動議，由秘書處擬定者。同時，並電行總中共代表伍雲甫，請予轉致。廿七日上午九時半，參會舉行第十二次會議時，副秘書長雷震首向大會宣認電文，並說明為儘早通知中共，故先於中央廣播電台即晚播出。廿七日下午三時，中央電台再聯合全國廣播電台播送一次。大會對電文及處理情形完全同意，此項電文當經參政會正式發表，原文如下：</p>
<p>毛澤哀，林祖涵，黃必武，周恩來，吳玉章，鄧頴超，陳紹禹諸先生公鑒，本日大會以和平為國人一致之要求，本會同人應為最後之努力，以解救民族之危機，決議電請中共參政員諸先生來京出席，共策國是，特此電達，敬希察照，並請示復，國民參政會宥（廿六日）。</p>
<h3>資委會事業概況</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕資委會翁委長文灝，廿七日晨於參會報吿該會工作情况時，指出該會經辦國營工礦事業，目的在逐步建設國家資本，樹立民生主義經濟基礎，與一般所謂「官僚資本」完全不同。</p>
<h3>東北工業設備　十九均遭拆走</h3>
<p>資委會所經營之事業，可分成電力，煤，石油，鋼鐵，其他金屬（包括鎢銻錫等）機器，化學，水泥，糖等十大類，茲分五類予以說明：</p>
<p>（一）電力　甲，東北方面：日人在東北地區，電力發展程度甚高，其水力發電火力發電各廠，總發電量在二百萬瓩以上，惟自蘇軍進入後，大部即遭拆去，其後共軍跟隨而入，電力設備損失極重，現僅小豐滿有十四萬瓩，撫順三萬瓩，其他三萬瓩，總計廿萬瓩。十分損失九分，殊堪惋惜！乙，華北方面：華北發電中心為天津，北平及唐山，日人建有長途電綫，以為溝通，按日人原計劃，華北可有電力十二萬瓩，惟至戰爭結束時止，完成者僅六萬瓩，經吾人整理後，已增至九萬瓩，所惜由於原有設備不佳，機器來源不一，一切未臻理想，俟美國配備運到後，情形或可較好。丙台灣：原有電力卅二萬瓩，然日月潭發電廠於太平洋戰爭中遭炸毀，吾人接收時，僅存四萬瓩，自經整理後已有十八萬瓩，足敷全省之用。全國總電力約有九十萬瓩，其中屬於資委會者約五十七萬瓩，佔總額百分之六十三强，以中國之大，電力祇有此數，自不足用。美全國有電力五千萬瓩，英格蘭亦有十四萬瓩，吾人今後實有繼續努力必要。此處須附帶提及者，即長江三峽水利計劃完成後可供電千萬瓩以上，價格亦極低廉，所惜此一計劃，需款三四十億美金，實非在目前財務狀况下所允許，不得不忍痛暫停，以其餘力興辦其他小規模電廠。</p>
<h3>共軍攻陷煤礦　設備悉遭破壞</h3>
<p>（二）煤礦：　甲，東北方面：資委會接收之大煤礦有撫順，本溪，西安，北票，阜新等五廠，然此五廠，或因軍事關係無法續辦，或因設備不良，時生變故，產量銳减，每礦能日出五六千噸已感不易。乙，山西大同煤礦：該礦煤質極佳，為北方唯一大礦，品質高出開灤煤礦，吾人接收後正計劃加以整理，該礦已為共黨所陷，後雖再度光復，然機械大部被拆，重要部份悉遭破壞，現用土法開採，日僅採數百噸。丙，冀魯方面：山東中興煤礦及河北各礦，大部為共軍所毁。</p>
<p>（三）石油：　戰時我曾在甘肅採油，過去每年約可產四百萬加侖，惟因掘井時，各井間相距過近，現在降至每年廿萬加侖，本月可望增至卅萬加侖，下月續可增加，全年總量不致少於去歲。此外，東北方面，戰事結束前，日人曾考慮於東北設合成煉油廠，我接收後，暫不擬辦，此外原油煉製廠，現正整修中，下半年可望出油。台灣方面，日人在高雄所建油廠尙未完成，戰事即停止，我現正分三期建設，本年年底前可望完成。在外國採購之原油，分三批運來，每批六千噸，本月底前可望運到。總計我目前所產汽油，一年產量僅足供全國兩個月之用，有待繼續努力。</p>
<p>總計石油事業本年產最約為原油一千二百萬加侖。汽油一千八百萬加侖，煤油一千五百萬加侖，柴油一千六百萬加侖，重油及燃料油三千三百萬加侖，天然氣一八〇〇〇〇千立方呎，汽油產量約當全國需要量百分之廿。</p>
<p>（四）鋼鐵：　甲，東北方面：本溪，鞍山兩大廠，經蘇軍拆遷，共軍破壞，殘破不堪，鞍山現僅日產六十噸，至明年可大增加，希望日本賠償物資中，能獲得大部煉鋼機，則我國將來亦可自製鋼軌。乙，華北石景山，唐山等地亦有相當產量。目前困難為機械缺乏，若欲建立新基礎，應求助於賠償物資。就產量而言，資委會屬廠產品佔全國百分之百。</p>
<p>（五）水泥：　抗戰前，全國水泥總產量約一百萬噸，勝利後我在東北接收本溪等兩個廠，本溪水泥廠由於電力供應問題，產量受限制，另一廠機械被拆，兩廠本年可望出水泥五萬噸。華北方面兩廠，本年預計可出十四萬噸，台灣三個廠，本年可產十五　噸，明年可望增至四十萬噸，全國水泥總產量為七十萬噸，資委會產卅餘噸，約佔總量百分之四十五。</p>
<p>翁氏繼就資委會經營事業槪况略加報吿，據謂資委會事業組織約可分為兩大類：（一）獨資經營或與其他政府機關合資經營之事業，其組織方法分為有限公司及廠鑛兩種；（二）為有民股參加之事業，均依公司法之規定，採取股份有限公司方式。第一類事業共有七十個單位，截至三十五年底為止，其帳面固定資產價値約八千四百九十餘億元；第二類事業共二十三個單位，固定資產價値為一千九百餘億元，如依市價計算，其價値當不止此。</p>
<p>資委會職員人選注重專門技術，所有聯員共三萬二千人，工人共廿二萬人，總數達二十五萬人，職員待遇不超過公務人員待遇百分之三十，至資委會出品價格均採取低於市價政策，一部份事業如電，煤，石油，則受政府限價約束。其他鋼鐵，糖等由資委會予以相當限制。如上海生鐵市價每噸三百萬左右而資委會僅售一百八十餘萬，鋼品市價七百餘萬，資委會僅售三百五十萬至四百萬。</p>
<h3>去歲盈餘款項　全部繳交國庫</h3>
<p>就資委會全部事業營業狀況而言，去歲營業總收入為二千六百七十七億，支出為二千三百九十億，盈餘為二，八五億，已繳國庫。本年度盈餘盼能達五百億之數。資委會所辦事業對各項法定稅款均照徼。</p>
<p>翁氏繼就資委會根本方針加以分析，據謂資委會注重經辦及建設規模較大之基本工鑛事業，並不希望包攬過多抗戰時期因應急需辦之工廠及戳後所接收者，此等皆無續由政府經辦必要，將轉讓民營或地方政府。計業經轉讓者，有二十六個單位，其中有酒精化學電廠等。準備出讓者有十六個單位，其中五個為造紙廠，日可產紙百噸。</p>
<p>最後翁稱，資委會將來工作，一方面在修補殘廢，使其逐步開工，一方面在考慮需要建立新事業，在進行此類工作時，當然有種種困難，全國各地經濟情况不平穩，收支不能平衡，辦事者不能安心，即其一端；然旣任斯職，責無旁貸，自當努力以赴，以底於成。</p>
<h3>參會審委會名單決定　審查工作今開始　行政報告昨晚全部完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十七日電〕參政會此次大會，報吿階段廿七日傍晚全部完成，定二十八日起開始審查工作。大會所聽取之行政報吿，自二十一日開始，歷時七日，開會十三次，除地政，衛生兩部改向審查會報吿外，有政治報吿等十五個報吿，連同五院之書面報吿，送各審查委會審查。各審委會名單，經主席團提出後，於二十七日下午十三次會議通過。第一審委會由參政員杜苟若等組成，召集人為王澤民，陳紹賢，劉興。第二審查委會由參政員周生楨等組成，召集人為周覺，周謙沖，陳博生。第三委會由參政員黃肅方等組成，召集人為許孝炎，黃宇人，方少雲。第四委會由參政員潘連茹等組成，召集人為鄧飛黃。萬鴻圖，陳豹隱。第五委會由參政員姜蘇剛等組成，召集人為蕭一山，黃炎培，許紹棣。此外尙有兩特種審，會，第一委會由馬燦利等組成，召集人為張振鷺，鄒樹文，甘家馨。第二特種季會由光昇等組成，召集人為燕樹棠，江一平，端木愷等。二十八晨將首先舉行全體聯合審查會，審查有關和談各提案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕參會十二次會議，於廿七日晨九時半舉行，張伯苓主席，雷副秘長報吿：截到昨晚止，報到參政員共三〇一人，今日出席二〇九人。繩報吿大會電吿中共參政員來京出席電文業經廣播。報吿畢，即聽取資委會翁委員長文灝工作報吿，翁氏就工作情形，事業槪况，工作方針等項，詳加分析，繼由各參政員提出書面及口頭質詢約卅件，大部集中資委會在東北工作情形及西北，西南未來建設計劃，由翁氏擇要答覆，會議至十二時一刻許始散，今晨會議一般情形良好，參政員質詢亦不甚多，空氣殊見平靜。下午三時半舉行十三次大會，出席參政員二一九人，吳貽芳主席，首聽取行總霍署長寳樹工作報吿，繼由各參政員提出書面及口頭質詢卅三件，由霍氏簡單答覆，六時許休息十分鐘，續聽經部新部長陳啓天報吿，七時許散會。</p>
<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者兪振藝</p>
<p>翁文瀨報吿資委會工作時，一口浙江藍靑官話，連篇地名數字，聽來很吃力。</p>
<p>日本留給我們的機　設備，數目並不算少，但在東北的，最先給「稍稍打幾天仗」的蘇聯搬走，其後又因戰爭關係，毁了不少，翁氏報告此類事實時，頻稱「可惜」不止。</p>
<p>各參政員書面及口頭質詢時，對翁氏稱呼不一，有的稱翁部長，有的稱翁會長，亦有稱翁先生，有些參政員將經濟部的事問到資委會去。</p>
<p>有一位參政員問，我國西部若干省份遍地黃金，政府何不設法加以開採，以抑止通貨膨脹現象。陳豹隱調：西康吉林等地有原子能原素，為應新時代需要，應設法加以開採。</p>
<p>陳耀東問：「首都電廠，平時分區停電，到參政會開會那天大放光明，何其巧也」。他主張應該淸查全國官僚資本，而淸查工作應自南京開始，尤應自首都電廠發動。</p>
<p>東北工作情形，為質詢主要對象，顧畊野　，有些工作人員坐了汽車，滿街跑，吃　跳舞，置正事於不顧，天天吃「大魚大肉，酒食徽逐」，尙說「每天吃粗茶淡飯，努力工作」，眞對不起國家。</p>
<p>翁氏答　俏皮得很，對有些事說：「據我所知，沒有如此嚴重」。對東北人員荒唐事，答應「查一查」，並將中紡公司等不屬資委會管轄的事，全部推掉。</p>
<p>行總工作報告，瑣屑而無條理，盡是乏味數字，參政員席上因有呼呼入睡者。謔者謂，參政會會塲上需要的是「興奮劑救濟品」，不需要「催眠藥」。</p>
<p>參政員書面及口頭質詢，為救濟總署取了幾個怪名，有的稱之為「救濟本署」，有的稱之為「送物分署或「磨擦分署」。</p>
<p>好些參政員指出，行總以牛奶，罐頭，破衣拾老百姓，不能療釀，不能禦寒，眞是一費而不惠」。</p>
<p>余楠秋為湖南人呼籲，說當地飢民以樹皮為上等貧糧，東北參政員于汝洲亦「帶子眼淚到參會來」，希望能多多接濟。</p>
<p>何基鴻說，有人怪蔣廷黻不會做生意，而行總現在於霍署長領導下，出售物資，換取棉花轉售中紡，完全生意眼。</p>
<p>一連串的質詢，使本極沉寂之會塲空氣頓時轉為熱鬧，燕樹棠在台上大唱「三恨霍署長」，（一）恨他分配不公平，（二）恨他不知輕重緩急，（三）恨他面皮不够厚，博得不少笑聲，掌聲。</p>
<p>吳望伋以浙江國語大發宏論，他說行總一個分署的辦公人員多至數千，較省政府人員還多，機構龐大，浪費金錢。</p>
<p>行總質詢完畢，已經六點鐘，尙有經濟部報吿，一般咸極焦急，但在主席吳貽芳能幹的處理下，用口頭，用鈴聲，議事日程進行順利，一小時內完成全部工作，「參會最能幹主席」一頭銜實當之而無棟。</p>
<p>經部新部長陳啓天報吿，够得上稱簡單明瞭，短短十八分鐘，說明了態度，又說明了今後政策，確為本次大會中各長官報吿中最短者。</p>
<p>有一位參政員於書面詢問中，希望陳氏『打破官僚作風，一新國人耳目」今日提詢者，書面，口頭總共不過八件，為各部會被質詢最少者，足證各參政員對新部長客氣之一般。</p>
<h3>行總業務報告</h3>
<p>行總署長霍寳樹廿七日下午三時出席參政會報告，就行總之廣泛業務提出扼要之說明。霍氏指出，聯總全部基金僅廿億美元，最後決定配於中國之物資雖已佔聯總基金總額三分之一，依然不敷分配於各省市縣。</p>
<p>行總之一切業務活動，須根據中國政府與聯總所訂之基本協定，條約規定中國有忠實履行聯總大會議決案之義務；聯總對運華物資之處理，有諮詢監督之權，故行總對每一事件之處理，均與聯總協議後辦理。舉凡物資之分配，運輸，售買，使用，均由行聯總理混合組織之各委員會協商辦理。</p>
<p>聯總供給中國之物資，其噸位總計約二百七十萬噸，內救濟物資約百分之四十五，善後物資約百分之五十五各種物資分批運來，益感不敷分配。</p>
<p>物資到達後，一部份用於救濟，一部份用於善後。用於救濟者為急賑，工賑，遣送難民還鄕，及社會福利，截至今年四月底止，已遺送一百四十萬人還鄕。急賑工作已發放食物二十八萬噸，衣服二萬餘噸。工賑之項目，首重水利，次為修路，再次及於小型紡織及衛生工程等。水利方面之工程計有一百二十餘項，大者如黃河，海塘，長江，堤岸，珠江水利，大部分已完成，受益田畝共約六千萬市畝，受惠農民達三千萬人。至社會福利事業，已舉辦者計三千餘單位，或由行總直接辦，或由行總與社會團體合辦，或完全委託社會團體辦理，計已撥發食物十五萬噸，受惠者五百五十萬人。關於醫藥器材之使用，行總補助衛生機關公私醫院一千六百餘所，撥發病床設備一萬五千餘單位。</p>
<p>關於善後物資計有交通器材及工礦晨漁等器材，聯總已運來交通器材二十萬噸，現全世界均缺交通器材，聯總得之匪易。京滬粤漢兩路交通恢復之速，實得力於聯總器材之供應。工礦器材包括電機，電廠及煤礦設備等物。農漁器材種類甚多，較著者為新式漁輪百餘艘及一千餘部犁田機。</p>
<p>最後霍氏提及中共區之救濟，黃泛區之復興，及行總經費問題，謂「去年湘桂兩省災荒嚴重，各地工賑工程亦需要糧食，大部食糧用於搶救災區及舉辦工賑，不僅中共區所得不多，北方各省所得亦少，本年二三月份趕運物資二萬多噸往中共區，較同時期內其他區域所得為多。</p>
<p>黃泛區土壤將成沙漠，復興工作刻不容緩，最高當局及地方人士均熱心倡導泛區復興，行總豫，皖，蘇，三分署已自四月一日始集中全力辦理泛區工作。行總之經費，在國預算中雖佔相當之比例，但業務繁多仍不够支應，聯總為助我完成預定之計劃，准將五月卅一日以後不能交貨的物資，改講棉運華售賣，以補行總經費之不足。</p>
<p>霍氏報吿舉參政員提出口頭詢問十二件，均獲圓滿答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕行總霍器長廿七日在參會報吿時，大受各方攻擊，尤以東北各參政負質詢更烈，其他華北各省參政員對行總未能以足够糧食運往災區亦提嚴厲詢問。東北參政員韓春暄于汝洲，大聲疾呼，希望一方面能改進行總東北辦事處各種弊端，另一方面能以多量物資運往救齊。何基鴻·孫繩武等為華北災鴻呼籲，盼儘速撥糧接濟，救災急如救火，不容再緩：此外，尙有若干參政員為山東求救，發言咸極沉痛。燕樹棠及吳望伋等則對行總機構及辦事效率加以指斥，認行總分配不公平，不知緩急，並多浪貧。霍氏答覆謂，行總準備以糧食多多分配至北方，惟所可吿者，聯總運華一百九十萬噸物資中，糧食共百十萬噸，現已所剩無多，有米數萬頓擬分配至南方省份。比外存麺數萬噸擬用以接濟魯豫，目前行總尙未渡過危險期，盼中央地方及公私團體能予合作，盼各參政員能向國外多多呼籲，行總已提出要求，惟是否有望，尙難確言。</p>

<p>潘連茹提出，關於原則問題之詢問，詢報吿中對區域分配，何未提及，並詢在此原子彈時期，對工廠分散間題，有何計劃？另一參政員亦豐政府是否設計開採鈾礦，以應時代需要？當由翁氏一一答復。</p>

<h3>俞鴻鈞財政報告（續前日）</h3>
<p>（四）穏定金融</p>
<p>穩定金融，爲當前最重要之措施，照一年來實施情形，可提報告者：</p>
<p>（一）管理外匯：復員期間，爲鼓勵物資輸入，安定經濟生活，於卅五年三月間，開放外匯市塲，實施中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法，訂定美匯匯率爲二零二零。施行以還，國內久缺之各項必需品，雖得充分補充，但因匯率偏低之故，其他非必需品之進口，亦同時獲得鼓勵，若干外貨，並有與國產品競爭之勢。在另一方面，出口及僑匯，則以匯率不利之故，顯見萎縮，因於同年八月十九日調整美匯匯率爲三三五零，以求改善。但經過數月以後，因國內經濟情形未能穩定，出口貿易仍待繼續推廣，又於士年二月，政府公布經濟緊急措施方案時，改訂美匯匯率爲一二·〇〇〇，以期恢復經濟正常狀態，攙救國內工商業之技落。凡此措施，均爲適應當時環境，比照國內外貨幣購買力，予以適合之調整。</p>
<p>（二）運用黄金：勝利以後，黄金運用之效果，可得而述者：1自去年三月起，至本年二月止一年間，因中央銀行拋售黄金，法幣回籠之數，約為一萬億元左右；2每逢物價將有波動時，中央銀行即放出大量黄金，吸收法幣物價漲勢，藉以緩和。綜計一年間，因購買力之轉移於黄金，故囤積居奇之現象，得以比較减少；3去年外匯黑市，每隨物價波動而波動，影響於幣値信用者良非淺鮮，幸金價絕少變動，以此之故，外匯黑市，未有劇烈波動，惟黄金政策，雖可收效於一時，究非根本，穩定經濟之方，尤以自去年年底以來，全國各地游資麕集上海，羣以黄金爲投機對象，央行如不大量拋售，，則金價日高，剌激物價，如擬以全力與投機者相搏，則犧牲甚大，徒使牟利者益增利潤，於是政府運用黄金政策，不得不改絃易轍。自經濟緊急措施方案施行後，黄金禁止買賣，並嚴禁黑市交易，蓋使金價與物價絕緣，减少物價波動之因素，似均不失為因時制宜之措施。</p>
<p>（三）管制利率，本部對利率政策，向照下列原則辦理：1農工礦生產事業資金之通融，由國家行局低利貸予，惟嚴密放核其用途，以防杜假名套利，2銀行一般存放款利率，由各地銀錢業同業公會，參酌市塲實况，議定利率，報請當地中央銀行核定牌吿，茲雖時移勢遷，而上列原則似仍可適用於今日，惟在物價與利率互為因果之狀態下無論平抑物價，或平抑利率，均非任何片面辦法所可望其有效，何况管制銀行利率爲一事，管制一般社會間之高利貸又爲一事，銀行爲法定組織，控制較易，一般社會間之借貸，初無固定形式與方法，管理自極困難，惟至捨後者於不問，而僅以銀行爲管制對象，其結果將有二：1爲迫令游資脫離正當金融機構，而羣趨於黑市；2爲迫令銀行暗中高利攬收存款，非法營運，濫造假賬，故一年來，爲全盤配合，以期實效起見，經就消極積極兩方面，分別爲有效之措施。消極方面，如核定利率辦法，厲行非法金融機構之取締，投機買賣之査禁，積極方面，如誘導游資流入正當金融機構，合理供應正當工商業之資金，以及擴大庫券勸寡等，目的在求解除農工生產所受高利之壓迫。（未完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>爭取和平的方向</h3>
<p>國民參政會已於廿六日通過參政員蕭一山等一百人所提出的臨時緊急動議，請求參政會迅速舉行全體審査會議，討論和平方案，並要求大會電吿中共參政員來京出席會議，共商國是，以解救民族的危機。這一個邀請中共恢復和談的電報，業已由參政會秘書處發出，而且參政會從今天起，審議各參政員所提出的和平方案。據中央社南京電，將提付全體審査會討論的和平方案，共有十八件之多，不僅「和平爲國人一致的要求」可於此獲一明證，而且參政員呼籲和平的熟忱，也可見一斑了。這次參政會的主要課題，乃在向政府與中共雙方呼籲和平，並共同商定一個切實有效的和平方案，俾使和談立即恢復，以打開目前政治上的僵局。所以全國上下對於這次國民參政會的召開，無不抱着莫大的期望；我們深願這次參政會確能把和平帶給人民。</p>
<p>在目前環境下，國人雖到致薪求和平安定，甚至渴望和平有如大旱之望雲霓，但是恢復和談的可能性，似仍非常渺茫。在政府言，爲解除人民的痛苦及挽救國家的危機計，自然極願國內立即能化干戈爲玉帛，也許其渴望和平統一的心情，比較任何人更要迫切，誠如內政部長張厲生氏所稱：「參政會爲民意機關，參政員提出和平要求，自屬必然，政府對於和平，亦殊切望。」所以和談的能否恢復，完全繫於中共的一念之間，國內和平能否實現的關鍵，悉操在中共的手裏。至於中共的態度如何？對於參政會的開會通知，旣置若岡聞，對於全國人士的呼籲，迄今也沒有作任何表示。現在參政會再度邀請中共參政員赴京共商國是，上海市參議會昨日也有電致毛澤東氏，懇切忠吿，但中共究能「欣然接受」與否，殊不可必。現在國人大家嚷着「活不下去」的哀號，要中共大發慈悲，替他們留下一綫生機，這種願望怎樣能够實現呢？參政員諸君對此，恐怕並無多大把握，就是提出臨時緊急動議的一百位參政員，也知之甚稔，在其臨時緊急動議案中也率直地表示：「雖徵諸以往事實，前途未可樂觀，但知其不可爲而爲之，應爲本會最後努力之方向。」</p>
<p>獲致國內和平的艱難，固如上述，但是我們依然要本着「知其不可爲而爲之」的精神，繼續努力。因爲目前國內局勢，雖極錯綜複雜，但由另一角度去觀察，也非常簡單。同樣，獲致國內和平，固然非常困難，但也可以說並非難事。我國民族素來講究精誠的，有所謂「精誠所至，金石爲開」，只要我們能有「百折不撓」的苦幹精神，人定可以勝天，無有不能成功者。何况我國政治向來重視王道，而主張採取霸道者，在政治上往往失敗。中共如若執迷不悟，一意孤行，仍爲一黨一私的偏見所曚蔽，而不能以國家民族爲重，則將不僅喪失其爲政黨的本質，且終必衆叛親離，無法存在。所以中共對於民意，不論其內心願意與否，究竟不能究全漠視的。只要全國人民在此千鈞一髮的關頭，都站出來說話，傾訴自身生活的痛苦，同時嚴正表示自身對於和平安定的願望，則大局未始不可挽回。凡是代表民意的機關，各省市縣的參議會，都應該在這個時候，同時召開緊急會議，商討獲致國內和平的方案，代表人民，一致向中共要求和平，立即放下武器，與政府重開和談。上海市參議會昨既通電呼籲於前，希望全國各省市縣的參議會，紛起響應，最後都能在最短期內，召開會議，對於和平安定有所表示，同時各推代表，集合首都，會同參政會代表，羣向中共要求和平，則中共庶幾也能明瞭今日全國民意的向背，而不得不加以尊重。</p>
<p>要之，全國人民一致起來，向中共要求和平，此其時矣！我們對於中共，至今還抱着一綫希望，相信中共人物。同爲黄帝子孫，決不致自絕於同胞，而被視爲非我族類。現在正是中共反省的最後時機，時不我留，稍縱即逝，何去何從，中共的確應爲最後的抉擇了。我們十分希望參政會和各省市參議會此次呼籲和平運動之能獲成功！</p>
<h3>如何改善制辦法</h3>
<p>新任經濟部部長陳啓天氏就職談話，對於管制辦法，亦有設法改善之表示。他的旨趣與辦法如何，雖還沒有具體地闡述出來，但就現在的管制情形而論，它的需要改善，無疑地是衆所關注的事。</p>
<p>嚴格說來，現在並沒有系統的管制辦法；所看到的管制辦法，除外匯·進口·黄金。外幣等買賣，較爲澈底外，其他都是零零碎碎，好像不甚經意似的。旣沒有體用兼備的方案，亦沒有一貫到底的方針。有時狂風驟雨，好徽十分嚴厲；有時却是有意無意地，不聞不問，彷彿沒有這件事一般，這裏且分類舉幾例如下，以見現行管制的一斑：</p>
<p>（一）關於生產方面的除掉原來的國營事業以外，如紗。布·蠶絲·油等事業，供有一部份歸國家經營；而同時，仍許民營企業的自由發展。表面上，且以自由競爭的姿態，並肩邁進，看不出甚麽管制的意味來。</p>
<p>（二）關於運銷方面的　如東北之大荳，台灣之食糖，以及燃料之管理等，皆具有獨占或半獨占的性質。可是管制的範圍，又往往限於其欄力所及的地方；並不能普及到全面。換句話說：凡是管不到或不願管的地方，就免不掉放棄不管。例如台　以銷到上海爲限，煤斤以採辦得到的爲限；限度以外，是否足敷需要，需要不够，應如何設法調劑，皆在不聞不問之列，所以管制兩字，實在似乎有些名不副實。</p>
<p>（三）關於分配方面的　有許多敵僞物資，是向由公家直接或委托其他機關標賣或配售的，如紗，布，藥品，人絲等皆是，還　民生日用必需品，依法應由各物資供應機關定量配售，這當然也屬於管制範園。其缺點，在有貨即配，無貨不理。以至黑市猖獗，常當會支配官價；完全失掉管制的作用。</p>
<p>（四）關於金融方面的　自從四聯總處成立以來，國家對於金融業務的管制，本在逐漸加强之中。經濟緊急措施方案中，更列有加强金融業務管制辦法一章，對於官商各金融機構之存放利息等項，限制很嚴。其於新設機構之取締，尤爲嚴密，無如地下錢莊到處皆是，幾成公開的秘密。國家行局對於各稱生產，出口等貸款，雖然名目繁多，似已盡了最大的努力；但工商界之融通，仍不能不求之於黑市，以至市面黑息，常盤旋在二角左右。一部份銀行錢莊，不經政府之委托，而擅自經營物品之購銷業務，乃至從事投機買賣的；亦復所在多有。至於資金的逃避，僑匯的横溢，以及宜僚資本的作祟，尤其明目張胆，亳無顧忌。可知金融業務之管制，也沒有發生多大的實際效力。</p>
<p>（五）關於物價方面的這一方面所採行的手段爲限價，議價，配售，貼補，和嚴禁抬價操縱，囤積居奇等，各地有關機關，多方設法，奉行未嘗本力；然而漲風愈熾，黑市愈張，一切平價方法，幾無不盡成具文。所謂物價管制云云，早已成了强弩之末了。</p>
<p>原來經濟以流通爲原則，一切人爲的限制，其收效本屬很難。英美等國，其立法號稱嚴密，辦理尤爲認眞，然而黑市終難絕迹。何况我國的管制。在橫的方面，旣大都限於一隅；未能同時並舉，而縱的方面，又以種種關係，不免因利乘便，採取片段的和一時的權宜之計，未能澈首澈尾，加以統盤的規劃。其在實施限制的技術方面，更不免過於主觀，不肯設身處地，爲利害關係人留一退步，致一般善良商民，形格勢禁，雖欲奉公守法，誠意合作而不可得。在此等情况之下，縱有循良廉謹的幹部，循規蹈短，切實推動，也未必能推行盡利，達成預期的效果。在主管機關，且明知其爲十分繁複吃草的工作，而又專打小算盤，或夾雜了其他副作用，冀以管制這付重擔，完全收效於此令等因的官話之中，那末，成敗得失之數，實不必待諸事後而始著。陳經濟部長如果眞欲改善管制辦法，則以上擅些事實，實不宜過於忽視。</p>

<h3>艾德禮發表演雨　為貝文外交辯護　英考慮改變對歐洲政策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：英首相艾德禮今日在工黨大會中發表重要演說，痛斥反對者之一切造謠中傷，據稱：「貝文之外交政策，既非追隨美國，亦非反蘇。民主社會主義，乃和平，繁榮，自由與快樂之途徑。英國現正以此點顯示全世界。英國決不屈居人下，所追求者，乃與各國之合作。對於貝文及其工作者，我人表示絕大之信心」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社英國馬蓋特廿七日電〕艾德禮首相今晨在工黨大會中發表演說，支持貝文外相之政策，駁斥「一般倚仗某一外國之人對吾人依賴某外國之指責」。艾相對於整個政府之工作表示信賴。在外交政策方面强調經濟談判之重要性，殆指英國對波蘭與匈牙利之經濟協定而言。艾相指責保守黨反對派缺乏任何一般的計劃足與工黨競爭。同時，大會今晨選舉執行委員會委員，與上屆選出者相同，包括衛生大臣裴旁，財政大臣達爾頓及樞密大臣莫理遜在內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：英國現正在考慮改變其對西歐之政策，以改善與共黨所控制之各國政府之關係。例如英國根據此次新政策，近已承認波蘭，保加利亞與羅馬尼亞各國政府，幷在設法與南斯拉夫，捷克，匈牙利，改善關係。但英國同時亦將在東歐担負其新任務，以增强各該國內社會民主黨之地位。今英國改變政策之徵象，可由下述各端覘知之：（一）政府已決定派工黨前領袖諾爾貝克率領親善代表團前往南斯拉夫訪問；（二）政府亦已決定派工黨秘書長斐列浦於六月間前往羅馬尼亞，與該國社會民主黨聯絡；（三）政府已邀請保加利亞派外交代表團至英；（四）英國在原則上已同意與波蘭締結商務公約，幷已決定與之續訂英波經濟協定。此外，英蘇二國決定進行商務談判，尤具有更大之意義。外交陣綫方面，英國且已提議修正英蘇二十年軍事同盟條約，據外交部人士稱，新草約擬將此一同盟延長爲五十年。以過去經騐而論，英國與蘇聯關係改善，則亦能自然促進與東歐各國間之友誼</p>
<h3>英工黨大會批准　承平時期兵役法　此法顯示反貝文力量已削弱</h3>
<p>〔路透社瑪蓋特廿六日電〕英國工黨大會今日以四對一之比數，批准政府之兵役政策。關於征兵之辯論殊爲熱烈，良以戰前之和平主義在工黨內部，仍具有潛勢力之故。一提出決議案以反對兵役法下喪失自由之黨員，特別指出根據兵役法末期彼召之人·須至一九六一年始能擺脫軍事責任·時距戰爭之結束當已十六年矣。伍萊爾亦支持該案，謂英國在軍事方面已與美國結成一氣，征兵法之施行，乃帝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥訪美之結果。工黨議員台維斯之言，更爲激烈，表示對政府之於和平時代使國家軍事化，提出抗議，並指出工黨於參加競選時並未向選民表示將有此一行動。上屆工黨主席拉斯　敎授代表執委會作答，聲言政府必須得有保衛英國之力量，如不實行征兵，祗能採用舊式的募兵制度，或給予陸軍以特殊權益，使其成爲一特殊階級以資吸引。結果反對兵役法案以二百卅三萬二千票對五十七萬一千票被否決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瑪蓋特廿六日電〕工黨今日表決贊成和平時期兵役法，以支持英國外交政策並制止共產主義。此舉預示黨內反對貝文之力量顯已削弱，「叛亂」份子認爲該一政策過分追隨美國而敵視蘇聨，現遭壓倒。工黨大會並將譴責英對希政策及駁斥杜魯門主義援助希土等提案兩件列入議程，將予討論，繼付表決。猛烈抨擊英國對巴勒斯坦政策之提案多件，則自議程中删去，另增綜合提案一件，重申工黨見解，主張猶太人應有「國家」，且在聖地占據大多數人口。</p>
<h3>甘地再度要求　英國退出印度</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿六日電〕今日爲甘地之靜默日，在祈禱會中，甘地並未親自發言，僅由人宣讀其演辭，要求英國解放印度之大村洛，並根據一九四六年五月十六日之英內閣使命團計劃，退出印度。演辭又云：在英國之權力力留印期間，印度殊不能自理其事務。英國之任務非在變更印度，而爲在允諾的期限以前退出印度。余及眞納已曾發表共同宣言，呼籲勿得以暴力爭取政治目標，全國若不顧此一文件，繼續使用暴力，則於英國退出以後，不免發生流血，屆時整個世界，必將　責印度。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里廿六日電〕甘地於自巴特那赴德里途中，失落其廿五年來經常携帶之最珍貴手表。尼赫魯今曾訪甘地。</p>
<p>試給新閣　避不羅政共黨</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：義大利內定總理今日獲得其基督民主黨大部份黨員之批准，試行組織並無共黨及左派人物參加之政府。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿七日廣播：加斯貝利開始組織義大利新閣，而將義大利共產黨剔除。加氏謂目前之政治危機，將就兩種方法中擇一行之：（一）組織基督敎民主黨內閣，而吸收若干名義上獨立之專家。（二）以基督敎民主黨及少數左翼政黨合組內閣。加氏曾謂渠已不能實現其全國統一政府之目的。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿六日電〕義大利之政府危機仍無解決之望，基督民主黨領袖　斯貝利與社會黨領袖南尼之對立，似爲其中之主要問題。加斯貝利之主張擴大其前聯合內閣，遭遇南尼之堅決反對，蓋擴大之後，將使南尼領導之左　正宗社會，與薩拉　特領導之分裂社會黨，處於同等地位之故。南尼週末在威尼斯發表談話，指加斯貝利爲反動派之工具，應負此次危機之全責。南尼與加斯貝利間之不陸，使組織新政府之工作頗受阻撓，故加期貝利是否得如願以償，以擴大其原有之聯合內閣，以容納左右兩派之社曾黨以及共產黨自中由黨，尙難逆料也。</p>
<h3>大批納粹爪牙　執行集體絞決</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫斯堡廿七日電〕在　韜森集中營屠殺人類之納粹份子廿二名，今日在倫斯堡獄中絞決，各人行刑時間相陽七分鐘。另有集中營之官員與衛軍廿七名定於明日絞決，此爲迄於目前止，盟國方面對戰犯最大之集體絞決。</p>
<h3>德境英美佔區當局商妥　經濟復興新方案　設立經委會賦予德人廣大權力</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕可靠方面息：德境英軍區長官羅勃森將軍與美軍區長官克萊將軍，在柏林舉行之談話，明日即可正式宣布結束。其公報以內，可望列有兩區經濟復興之憲章，英美所成立以執行去年兩區經濟合併協定之協議內，包括下列三點：（一）設立兩區德人經濟委員會，可靠方面謂此一委會之組織及其與邦政府之關係，已由英美兩國同意一，此一委會將爲迄至目前爲止德國西部最有力之德人政治機構。（二）一九四六年三月四强議定之德國工業水準，已予以修正，英美今已決定准許德國每年產鋼一千萬至一千二百萬噸，此即貝文外相在最近莫斯科會議中建議之數量。原有之四强協定規定德全國得有年產鋼鐵七百萬噸之能力，實際產量每年以五百八十萬噸爲限。在此數內英軍區之產量水準，僅約四百萬噸，而實際上之產量猶遠較四强規定之最高水準爲低。可靠方面謂，前述之一千萬至一千二百萬噸，乃英美兩區每年之鋼鐵實際產量，此外兩區內可以拆卸以供賠償之工廠，已擬具肯定名單，鋼鐵業以外其他工業之產量，亦均已決定准其作類似之增加，此項步驟不啻爲德國西部經濟復興之開端。（三）規定准許以更自由之方式，使用佔領區之資財以輸入工業原料。據　，羅勃森—克萊協定衹須在明日之末次談話中，作若干次要的最後決議即可完成。倫敦外交界人士咸認此一協定，表示英美當局巳盡其所能，以防止德國經濟局勢在成立四强最後協定以前之過渡期內繼續惡化。</p>
<h3>巴根漢返英　向貝文提報告</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕德境英國佔領區事務大臣巴根漢勛爵，今晚偕同其秘書瓊斯自德乘坐專機返抵此問，下機後對於其在德國之使命，拒不發表聲明，預料渠將前往瑪蓋特會晤貝文外相，對於視察德國情形有所報吿。</p>
<h3>美國決定參加　國際難民機構</h3>
<p>衆院外委會已予批准</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕衆院外交委員會今日一致通過議案，批准美政府參加國際難民機構。該案有兩點與參院所通過之法案不同。參院批准七千五百萬美元，以作爲美國一九四八會計年度對國際難民機構之捐款。衆院將之减削至七千三百萬元。該會並規定一項條款，即將基金之一部分可繼續充美國救濟流亡計劃之用，直至國際難民機構開始執行其任務云。</p>
<h3>胡佛函覆塔柏</h3>
<p>主張早日與德日訂和</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿七日均〕關於陸軍部所提在下一會計年度內撥款七億二千五百萬美元，以之購置糧食接濟德國日本與朝鮮一項建議，衆院財政委員會主席塔柏德詢糧食緊急會顧主席胡佛之意見後，頃悉胡佛已覆函塔柏，主張美國應與德日二國早日簽訂和約。該函幷譴賣蘇聯阻撓世界之經濟復興工作，且謂倘下屆四國外長會議仍然失敗，則英美二國可在其佔領區內與德國簽訂和約。</p>
<h3>蘇明令廢除色刑　蘇佔區是滯適用並未說明</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕蘇聯今夜頒佈廢除死刑之法令，此爲戰後世界第一個實行禁止極刑之國家。據莫斯科電台廣播當局所發表之官報稱：目前難仍有侵略份子企圖挑撥戰事，但蘇聯相信世界已獲得長期和平之保障，故採取此一非常行動，且亦爲蘇聯人民忠正爲國所產生之結果。自今日始，蘇聯最高法院所將判處之死刑案件，均將改爲最高廿五年之有期徒刑。至死刑案件共有若干，及此一法令是否適用於德國與奧地利等蘇聯佔領區，則官方均未說明。關於蘇聯在佔領區所已判處之死刑案件及戰時與戰後所已正法之賣國犯人數，蘇聯亦從未宣佈。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統向國會提出　美洲軍事合作案　目的在鞏固西半球和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕社魯門總統今日請國會制定與拉丁美洲國家從事充分軍事合作計劃之立法案，包括軍械之出售，武器之標準化及海陸空軍人員之訓練等。在參衆兩院宣讀之總統咨文，指出「此項軍事合作並可擴大至加拿大，後者與美國關於共同防務之合作目前具有特殊重要性」。總統之在西半球防禦計劃中提及加拿大尙以此爲第一次。加拿大旣非汎美聯盟之會員，又非却布爾台員克公約之簽字者，故前此關於西半球防務之討論，並無加拿大之參加。</p>
<p>總統之資文並謂：「美洲共和國，在却布台貝克公約及聯合國憲章中，已接受互相防衛及維持和平之新責任。却布臺貝克公約規定之合作，使美洲共和國有根據美洲防務局之建議，使軍事訓練及配備機構準化之極標度需要。本案所規定之任何行動，應與聯合國憲章少辭句及精神相符合。美國具有高級的技術知識及經濟軍事資源，故此項責任自當由美國負担，武器及軍事配備之供洽美洲其他國家，具有合理而有限制的目的，美國政府決不贊成或參加無限制的軍備分配，以防免不必要的軍備競爭。美政府當使軍事上的發展以維持和平及安全爲目的，並使陸海空軍之設備，不越出安全需要的範圍」。</p>
<p>召開南美會議擬訂防務公約</p>
<p>總統提出之法案將使總統有權與其他美洲國家成立下一列協定：（一）以訓練此等國家之陸海空軍人員；（二）以維持及修理此等國家所有之陸海空軍配備；（三）在與美國國家需要及國家利益相符之條件下，以武器彈藥及戰爭用具移讓此等國家。總統並曰：此一計劃將包括在美國鼓勵拉丁美洲經濟發展之政策以內。蓋生活水準之改良及社會文化福利之促進，爲國際和平及安全之先決條件。本案於執行之際，當不使他國人民因軍備負担之增加而妨碍其經濟發展。同時並將防止任何開家利用此等武器，以反對美國及其他美洲國家所擁護之和平民主原則。獲得美國武器之國均不得轉讓於第三者。總統復透露操在里約熱內盧召開拉丁美洲會議以草具西半球防務公約。</p>
<p>力促政府放棄帝國主義政策</p>
<p>另一關於殖民政策之決議案，促政府放棄過去之帝國主義，並發展殖民地之福利以償已往之過失。該案已經執委會接受，內容要求；（一）殖民地長官應爲負責的民事行政官員；（二）應使土人得參加較高級之行政及技術職位；（三）專家及行政官吏應以同情當地居民之人担任；（四）有色人種應與白種人處於平等地位，獲得同等機會，爲達到此一目的起見，一般敎育水準應予提高；（五）晨工業之發展應以促進土人之就業並提高其生活水準爲先，土人應有組織工會之充分自由；（六）殖民部之社會主義政策應向各有關官員詳細釋明，俾得使其迅速施行。</p>
<h3>兩院反響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿七日廣播：國會對於杜魯門促請與西半球各國實行軍事合作之呼籲，並未立即發生反響。參衆兩院似感覺其請求可等待若干時，但兩院領袖均認爲在相當時期可以考慮此項計劃。</p>
<h3>華萊士演說</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社俄勃岡州波特蘭城廿七日電〕美國前商務部長華萊士爲宣傳和平運動，現在美國週謝各地，頃在此間發表演說，預示美國今之一黨政府繼續致力於使歐洲成爲反蘇武裝陣營，其結果恐反將迫使英法斯干蒂那維亞及歐洲其他各國進入蘇聨勞力範圍之內云。</p>
<h3>美在大規模援助歐洲前　應先仲使歐洲經濟合作　美擬召羡慕國際特別會議</h3>
<p>〔本眾社華盛頓廿六日電〕當參院內提起在今秋召集國會特別會議，討論國務院政策委員會正大草擬之美國遠大援助計劃時，參議院中又湧起另一要求，主張美國在另外化費數十億美元作為援助歐洲復興經費之前，必須促使歐洲國家之經濟合作。素以「國際主義者」著稱之民主黨參議員福爾勃賴脫及共和黨議員洛琪，最近亦贊同國會中主張設立歐洲商業聯合會之人士。福氏對於美國援助歐洲一事前曾竭力擁護，頃發表談話稱：除非採取正當步驟，使歐洲各國因經濟合作而能經濟自立，渠或將不再支持數十億美元之新援助計劃。渠又謂：「如無此項發展，吾人將處於挑雪塡井之境地。」民主黨諸領袖現正向各方面探詢關於今秋召集國會特別會議之意見，彼等認爲範圍龐大之新援助計劃必致引起遷延更久之爭執，援助希土法案之辯論較預定期限（三月底）已遷延五週之久，新援助計劃之辯論時日必將較其遠爲久長云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿六日電〕據合衆社統計，美國自第二次世界大戰結束後至本年杪爲止，爲救濟及復興戰後世界所耗費之款項約達二百六十六億八千四百八十三萬一千美元之鉅，但較諸美國為戰為戰爭勝利所耗之在千五百億美元，則不及百分之八。</p>
<h3>自由堅拒參加政府　日籌組三黨內閣　保守革新二派對車趨表面化</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿七日電〕關於片山籌組四黨聯合內閣一事，目前囚自由黨態度之强硬，不得不趨向社會，民主，國協三黨聯合內閣之途進行。社會黨方面於廿七日下午七時十五分，在首相官邸舉行重要會議，出席者有片山，西尾，水谷，平野等重要幹部，結果對組織新閣方針，已獲得協議，惟內容尙未公開發表。據悉：將以對民主黨，尤以拉攏蘆田派爲重心，而推進組閣工作。至此，保守革新兩派之對立，已趨表面化，而對日本政治前途之影響，自不容忽視矣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿七日電〕日新相片山廿七日吿本社記者稱：日本需要聯合內閣，若其他政黨繼續不予合作，渠將立即組織毫無反對黨之內閣。片山之談話粉碎自由黨與民主黨若干黨員之希望，彼等希望片山新首相組織四黨聯合內閣失敗而辭職。片山並稱：渠相信渠有組織一黨內閣之力量，但希望其他政黨勿迫其出此一舉。</p>

<p>保守派議員組反共陣綫</p>

<h3>蘇聨控制下的　德國政治局</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>蘇聯刻在柏林設置一個政治機構，和克林姆宮直接發生關係，代替紅軍管理德境蘇聯佔領區。所有組織步驟現正在進行中，一旦正式成立，目前的軍事佔領將由純粹的民事行政取而代之。此項機構設置的目的在保證德國共產黨在蘇聯佔領區的優勢。</p>
<p>蘇聯當局深恐不能在德國普遍收服民心，故竭力設法使當地的共產黨在接收德國行政以前取得優勢。</p>
<p>此項機構的組織大略如下：德國新統治機構的中心組織是以莫斯科組織爲籃本的政治局。行政官馬卡洛夫中將將爲克林姆宮直接派駐德國政治局的代表。馬氏將爲蘇聯佔領區軍事長官梭科洛夫斯基技術上的助手，負責處理一切政治及經濟問題。</p>
<p>德國政治局名義上的首長是納多希義，此人在外國不很出名，他和蘇聯共產黨秘書處發生聯繫。</p>
<p>政治局負有下列使命：（一）儘速恢復對德國人的威信；（二）獎勵反對黨的活動，以表現蘇聯佔領區內的自由；（三）改善對聯合國的關係。爲加强共產黨的勢力，德國領袖大批調動。共產黨元老烏爾勃里赫及皮克在慕後策動，皮克的代理人葛羅脫烏爾準備大施伎倆，以籠絡德國反對派人士。</p>
<p>德國政治局起原於克林姆宮高級官員貝利亞的訪問德國。他到波茨坦去施行手術，但在留德三星期內，他曾和蘇聯佔領區裏的蘇聯和德國領袖晤談。關於撤離聯合國佔領軍以及最後將行政權移交與德國人的籌備工作，便是貝利亞奠定基礎的。</p>
<p>蘇聯佔領區內設立新政治機構一事，和最近數月內蘇蘇軍的大量撤退有關。蘇聯派駐德國的軍隊現已减至約二十萬人。蘇聯在德國的軍事實力雖因此削弱，但蘇聯正努力由政治途徑來加强他們的控制力。</p>
<p>蘇聯在德國的策略是政治手腕和宣　變管齊下的。</p>
<p>基督敎民主同盟與以蘇聯背景的社會統一黨的政治休戰，似乎是蘇聯執政當局的一個重要目的。這兩個敵對的政黨如能友好合作，蘇聯使可以推行蘇聯式的民主政治。蘇聯眞正的控制是在幕後的，通過蘇聯佔領區內政部長的。</p>
<p>蘇聯佔領區內的政治策略，是和蘇聯在匈牙利和巴爾幹所推行的現行政策相一致的，即在蘇聯佔領軍撤退以前，設法加强當地共產黨的政治控制。</p>
<p>蘇聯為對德國人表示友好起見，允許增加食糧配給和衣着皮鞋及其他消費品的供給數量。</p>
<p>據曾在蘇佔領區作數日之遊的新聞記者最近報吿稱：蘇聯佔領區裏的德國人的生活似乎比較西部佔領區裏的德國人舒適。可是爲了政治上的緣故，反蘇情緒異常高昂。住在蘇聯佔領區裏的德國人怨恨蘇聯的政治太嚴酷，對其他佔領區裏德國人的自由生活表示羡慕。</p>
<p>問題是蘇聯怎樣實踐它的諾言。在外表上新政治局的目的在蘄致德國的統一，可是實際上對西方列强仍不斷作反宣傳。供給反對黨基督敎民主同盟報紙的紙張已被核减百分之五十，但蘇聯佔領區內其他報紙並未减少。　蘇聯在德國的眞正目的無非是擴張蘇聯的勢力。政治局也許是個比較友好的機構，但其使命不外是帮助達成上項目的。</p>
<h3>越南全國聨合同盟　發表擁護政府宣言</h3>

<h3>聖地調查委會首次會議　賴伊勗勉各代表　該委會有充分權力作澈底調查</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國之巴勒斯坦調査委員會本日舉行首次會議，開始該委員會本身之組織工作，並討論是否應赴默洲流亡人民集中營實地調査。　聯合國秘書長賴伊致開幕詞稱：十一國委員會應切記彼等乃代表數百萬人民之信仰與希望，數百萬人民對於聯合國有無能力貫澈此項重大任務之信仰，有賴於該委員會之工作結果。賴伊指出該委員會有搜求事實及調査一切關於巴勒斯坦問題之最大權力，唯一限制即爲時間問題。該委員會須於九月一日之前提呈報吿書，傳聯合國各會員國可於九月中間舉行聯大常會之前，硏究報吿內容。調査委員會在開始工作之初，已知阿拉伯國家堅持調查範園僅限於巴勒斯坦一地，阿拉伯國家曾於該委員會成立之前，備文通知稱：彼等反對該委員會赴歐調査流亡人民之集中營。現有各種跡象表示彼等將獲得若干國家之支持，諒由印度（亦係調査委員會之一）所領導。但另有若干中立國家，如瑞典危地馬拉。捷古及南期拉夫等曾表示，歐洲猶太難民問題應與整個巴勒斯坦問題有連帶關係。猶太復國會方面則並未表示該會對此事之態度。負責處理託管事宜之助理秘書長中國代表胡世澤博士頃證實猶太復國會曾要求派遣觀察員隨同調査委員會出發。猶太復國會保證加以全面合作，並要求允許彼等之代表隨同調査委員會出發，與該委員會保持接觸云。</p>
<h3>美精神病學家發明　吸氣新療法　能治口吃嗜酒等癥</h3>

<h3>參議大會首次會議　對爆裂荒指數學潮　市長作詳盡分析　報告重心集中安定社會問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第三次大會，於昨日下午三時舉行苜次會議，由市長報吿施政情形。參議員對民政，警察，社會，財政，地政等提質詢，並由各局長分別答覆。昨日大會中市長報吿及參議員質詢之主要點均集中於安定社會問題，尤以米價一項爲最。</p>
<p>吳市長施政報吿略謂，市府經常施政，已另有書面報吿，故特對當前糧食，工人生活及學潮三大問題提出報告：</p>
<p>（一）糧食問題，本人自來滬後，無日無廢不以米價問題爲念，最近不幸發生學潮，終日應付，致對米潮無暇顧及，但今日米價已見跌落，現正竭力設法抑平。緣去年一年中曾發生三次米潮，當時即採用取締囤積居奇，大量拋米之方法，故三次共拋米不到二十萬担，米潮即穩定渡過。然今年情形不同，第一次發生在金潮之後，最近自四月初至今，雖已拋米達二十萬祖，現仍每天拋米約一萬一千担，然風潮尙未平息。原擬以去年方法處理迄無效果。</p>
<p>糧食　來源　缺乏</p>
<p>其量大原因爲米糧來原缺乏。蓋以前江北一帶之米，均可供應江南，而今江北大部區域爲共黨擾亂，或將存米搶走，或阻止生產，致以往供米之地，現一變而爲求米之區。同時上海向來仰賴供米之地如蚌埠，無錫，蘇州一帶，今本身也發生米荒，故造成目前現象。估計上海每月需米五十萬祖，而現能供給者，僅三十萬担。同時一般市民咸恐米糧不够，往往多存備若干亦爲增加數量要求原因。市府現一方面禁止本市米糧出口，一方面請求糧食部增撥，相信可减輕嚴重情形。此外並准許米商自由貿易，至於配米方法乃根據名册，嚴格調査，尙不致發生流弊。</p>
<p>工人　生活　問題</p>
<p>（二）工人生活問題，本人對於工界同胞安心工作，努力生產，深覺愉快並極感謝。但欲謀工人生活安定，即須提出生活指數問題。本人對工界待遇提高，極爲贊成，但必須依「不超過生產事業負担」之原則。現市府已與社會局，總工會，商會，工業協會商決折衷解凍生活指數辦法。對所提出無條件解凍之口號，吾人認爲於工人不利，徒足以使工人失業。</p>
<p>至編製生活指數辦法不能公開原因，乃怕發生糾紛。今編製之指數，須經審議委員會審查，而該會又係由市府，參議會，社會局，工協會，商會，各派一代表，總工會派二代表共同組織，絕對公正。其辦法乃於每週三調査物價一次，一月中最最一個星期三與其他三個星期三之物價平均數所得即生活指數，於星期四編就後，星期五由審議會通過，月底發表。</p>
<p>學潮　有兩　欵點</p>
<p>（三）學潮問題，我人對於靑年最爲愛護，相信百分之九十靑年都屬優秀份子，但事實上有若千學生違反法律，受人操縱利用，據本人親自經歷，發現二點，敢斷定其有背景：（一）在很短時期內，發生許多不同事件，而變成相間事件。（二）在學潮中所見種種不同現象，似有同樣技術。政府採用辦法爲（一）要求安定，（二）愛護靑年，（亦即安定第一，求學第一）。對於違法靑年，不得不依法辦理。如學校復課，希望家長對子弟加以勸導。參議會所決議二案，極爲感謝。</p>
<p>會塲中側耳聽參議員質詢之吳市長曁各局處長（本報攝）</p>
<h3>糧價問題　紛提質詢　米麥外匯為何減少　配米究有多少實惠　吳開先逐項加以答復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於米價問題，最爲參議員所注意，向市府提出質詢及建議者達十餘位之多：</p>
<p>施宗德提　第二期轍入限額，政府批准米麥數量，反較第一期减少一千三百萬美元，（第一期爲二千萬美元），此亦爲引起米價高漲之一大原因，故要求政府（一）即速寬放外匯，（二）向川省設法採米，（三）開放倉庫澈査存底。</p>
<p>趙仰雄提：（一）市府實行配米辦法後，受惠究有多少？（二）配米辦法在十天前即公布，至今猶未實施，究至何時可以施行？如因調查工作不及，可否多加人員，趕快完成？（三）配米定須求其公平合理，請問除普通公敎人員外，其他政府團體機關人員爲何不予配</p>
<p>姚抱眞提：（一）除了公敎人員市民階層外，其他普通市民之食米問題如何解決？。市長對採辦洋米一點，是否認爲可行？（三）報載洋米及川米等運抵，市長可否向有關當局交涉，儘先撥交本市？（四）配米技術問題請加以注意。</p>
<p>抵埠米糧·不能全配</p>
<p>繼由社會局局長吳開先，對該項問題逐項答覆如下：（一）採購川米，經中央規定應由糧食部統一辦理。（二）外埠或外洋來米乃供全國之用，歸糧食部分配，上海僅爲進口之地，故不能要求全歸本市，僅能向糧食部建議及請求增撥或先撥。（三）江浙一帶，及四川，湖南雖屬豐收，但其他各地，被共黨擾亂，需要接濟之量，仍甚龐大。（四）處理米蛀虫一點，決予照辦，祗要調査屬實，無不嚴辦，並抱有決心。（五）民食調整會成立後，是否一定跌價，則無法保證，但我們決盡力去做，非但不使其漲，而且要使其跌。</p>
<p>計口授糧·未能採用</p>
<p>（六）職業工人並非不予配米，不過稍有限制，如一·三輪車夫等，無固定雇主者，應予配給，二·有雇主而不供給伙食者亦予配給，衹有有雇主且又供給伙食者，則不予配給。（七）計口授糧乃最元善之辦法，其所以不採用者，實因米量有限，不數分配之故。目前祗能根據實力，先以最需要救濟者爲第一，然後逐步擴大，希望以後上海每人每月，能配到一斗米，目前每人每月僅能三升耳。</p>
<p>吳局長另對方如升所提質詢「工廠檢査法公布已十年，爲何猶未實行」一點，答稱，是項檢査法歸工務局辦理，如需社會局辦理，可請社會部與市府商洽設置工礦檢査委員會。</p>
<h3>「燒罷打亂拖賴推忘」　收回跑馬廳　防止大遊行　市長一一答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日參會中其他質詢，有張中原提：跑馬廳收回進行到如何程度？陶百川建議：（一）在跑馬廳未收回前，先商洽開放供市民休憇之用（二）聞六月二日本市將有總罷課，大遊行事件市長如何防備，可得聞歟？同時建議參議會推派代表，成立一委員會，作爲聯繫及入各學校做疏導工作，協助市長解決當前大問題。陳高鏞形容目前局勢爲：「燒·罷·打·亂·」，市府辦事則「拖·賴·推·忘」。王維駰謂：財局各種稅收繳納無一定地點，對人民極不便利，手續既繁，處理又無系統，要求改善。</p>
<p>吳市長答覆：（一）關於六月二日罷課遊行準備嚴格措施，但未便公開宣佈，如參議員願詢問，可另計時間交換意見。（二）對建議參議員組織委員會協助疏導工作，極爲贊同並表感謝。（三）跑馬廳收回問題，經商議後，對方認爲如以江灣郊區相調換，原則上可予贊同，但須付與修理費。至跑馬廳內部利用問題，因現已被美軍體育會租用，故須以滬西交通便利之區相交換，方可辦到。但正式方案，須待跑馬廳負責人由本國回滬後，方可進行。至要求開放爲公園，恐亦不易做到，因其房屋及土地，均已分別出租，但市府自當盡力交涉。（四）「燒罷打亂」之事，顯有暴徒操縱。市府辦事決可儘量不「拖賴推忘」。</p>
<p>民政處張曉崧因賈德超質詢稱：「張處長似有包辦選舉嫌疑，恐怕是想做民選市長」，表示不勝感慨，他說：「我無野心做市長，而且我年齡已到如此，事實上根本亦不可能的。至用人方面，我一定負責依法辦理，前次爲某員犯法，甚至親到法庭證明他犯法的」。其他如警察局副局長兪叔平，財政局長田永謙，地政局長祝平，亦均對質詢相繼答覆</p>
<h3>請願者　十餘起</h3>

<p>毛澤東先生大鑒：査抗戰勝利，我國榮列四强，方幸國基重奠，建國有期，乃先生統率共軍，反抗政府，禍起蕭墻，遍地烽火，民生於以塗炭，國力從而斵喪。前此政府渴望和平，曾多次約請商談，而先生以擁有武力，未能破除成見，遂致和談經年，兵禍未息，此種戰亂綿延殃民禍國之責任，固有目所共覩，非一手所能掩。茲者憲政實施在即，任何政黨，均可合法參預政治，政府固亦深盼先生等共謀國是，故不憚再三表示，願以政治方式解除當前之國內紛爭。乃日來風雲日緊，戰訊頻傳，是先生之態度愈趨極端。長此以往，國將不國，覆巢之下，寗有完卵。先生同爲黄帝子孫，豈無國家觀念，懸崖勒馬，時不可再。本會有鑒及此，爰於第一屆第三次大會第一次會議，經全體參議負一致決議，願向先生及中國共產黨盡其最後之忠吿，深盼先生以國家人民爲重，毅然放棄以武力稱雄之偏見，則日放下武器，宣告停戰，俾交通得以成精復，和談得以重開，尤望蒞京會商解決國是，化干戈爲玉帛，消戾氣爲祥和，國家幸甚，人民幸甚。否則固執成見，弄兵禍國，責有攸歸，人民將不復爲先生恕矣。何去何從，幸善圖之。上海市參議會辰感。</p>
<p>南京國民政府鈞鑒：査國家之建設，必以統一爲前提，社會之繁榮，當以安定爲基礎。慨自勝利以還，政府渴望和平統一，人民更願休養生息，而中國共產黨擁兵割據，得寸進尺，破壞紀綱，新喪國脈，對於弭兵息爭，迄無誠意，遂致經年和談，前功盡棄，戰塲烽火，日益熾烈，國譽日低，民生日艱。本會同人環顧大局，　焉如搗，爰經第三次大會第一次會議臨時緊急動議，一致主張電請政府從速限定日期，令飭中國共產黨迅即放下武器，靜候統編，派員進京，恢復和談，中央亦仍視爲政黨，就地停戰，不事追剿。否則政府應即集中全力，明令戡亂，以期早日結束軍事，促成國家統一，奠定永久和平。紀錄在卷。除另電中國共產黨，致最後諍吿，促其覺悟外，謹電奉陳、敬請鑒察，至祈俯順興情，採納施行。國家幸甚，民族幸甚。上海市參議會議長潘公展，副議長徐寄廎曁全體參議員同叩辰感印。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑</h3>
<p>（一）法律釋紛</p>
<p>健衡問　茲有法律疑問數則，乞予解答：（一）某甲於民國廿五年向乙借國幣八百元，利息常年一分八厘。並有田單作抵押品，定期一年，期滿向甲索還，甲一味延宕，迄今毫未歸還。請問甲在法律上犯何種罪行？是否欺詐罪？（二）起訴時可否要求以二千倍歸還？（三）利息超過本金在法律上是否合理</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕（一）欠款到期不還，非犯罪行爲。（二）訴請判償欠款，係民事訴訟，關於增加給付，係由法院公平裁量，法律未有本若干倍，利若干倍之訂定。（三）利不過本，見諸淸律，現行法無此條文。但利息之請求權，因五年間不行使而消滅，則爲民法第一百二十六條所規定。</p>
<p>（二）遺產繼承</p>
<p>王玉生問　前閱貴報法律質疑，　遺產繼承條例係規定五年前已撥付之產業，不應列入遺產範圍之內。惟未知五年前是從何年算起，鄙人現有產業係先父在三十二年贈與，不知是否列入遺產範圍之內？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕遺產稅法第八條云，被繼承人死亡前五年內分析或贈與之財產，應視爲遺產之一部。一律徵稅，可知計算五年，係以分析或贈與之日，與死亡之日，互相對照</p>

<h3>乒乓聨賽</h3>
<p>樂隊敗於泰山</p>
<p>二屆上海乒乓聯賽，前晚四塲交鋒，分別在精分郵務兩球室舉行，一部聯市迎戰二華與中友兩隊，時間既屆，二華人馬未到，聯市諸將未動干戈而獲勝利。接戰中友，首陣即爲中友取勝，初聯市不敢大意，擊來頗爲順手，連奪五關，結果以五對二擊退中友。另二部白隊奮發有爲，竟以直落七大敗浙興，與同部精武華聯華兩强，均以不敗鼎峙。白隊將士，胥屬後起，有此戰績，亦足自豪。次幕爲三部樂隊與泰山爭鋒，前者五戰五捷，銳氣正盛，後者曾敗於新生紅一次，聲譽降低不少，故戰來異常努力，樂隊不幸以抽手健將范松靑之失常，致遭對方盧仕棠之毒手，失去勝利基礎，復以末組隊長陳鵬堯之可勝不勝，更爲可惜，結果泰山以四對三力退樂隊，對該部冠軍，尙存一綫希望。樂隊良機錯過，非球藝不及，經騐不足耳。</p>
<p>今晚續有三塲，四部種子郵甲遇後起之秀靑鳥，郵甲雖可穩操勝券，但個人方面，恐難全勝。另華聯女將出戰春茂，華聯女雖六戰營北，但每塲演出，殊不弱於紡四東昌等隊，春茂健兒之球盛，高出有限，今晚如不拚命，頗有見辱於女將之可能。前晚結果</p>
<p>前晚結果</p>
<p>聯市勝二華（一部）棄槍</p>
<p>聯市勝中友（一部）五—二</p>

<h3>人造絲實銷淡　喊價一致挫落　廠經綢貨均形疲軟</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲因綢廠帮有配貨暫時可以應用，實銷甚淡，更因業中人有軋頭寸關係，亟欲脫貨求現，以致一二〇號高山有光開盤即喊一千七百四十萬元，一路下挫，慘跌至七百萬元收盤，比上日短去一百十萬元。下午銀根已軋齊，持貨者不願廉價出售，於是喊價又見提高，最後爲七百五十萬元賣出，結果仍較上日小去六十萬元。東洋及旭字等均隨之而升降。</p>
<p>昨市廠經又呈靜寂，喊價略形疲軟，做開B字等級一擋，價作二千〇八十五萬元，較上日短十五萬元，另担横條坯亦有幾包成交，價做一千八百五十萬元至八十萬元，其餘各級俱未聞成交。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨，眞絲被面喊價比上日短去二十萬元之譜，華强被面七百七十萬元有人賣出，大誠格子璧縐開市做三萬〇七百元，最後做五百元，比上日小一千元弱。華錦縐上午一萬四千元有人要，下午因人造絲下跌，三千五百元有成交。盛貨因鄉人蠶忙關係，出貨稀少，故產地市價反見　昂，申市因去胃不佳，售價仍站原盤。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，初爲頭寸軋緊，場內執貨者賣意頗濃，客帮納胃平淡，是以四二支藍鳳開價即降爲一千二百萬元左右，廿支雙馬爲六百七十萬元，嗣後實需求進，重吿回升。四二支藍鳳紗最後價回升至一千二百十萬元，廿支雙馬爲六百八十萬元，終比上日四二支及卅二支紗降五十萬元，廿支特雙馬金城則漲五萬至十五萬元，其餘廿支天女日光等牌及十六支紗，大都下挫。</p>
<h3>平價麵粉　今日尚難配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕平價麵粉之配售，因社會局與麵粉公會間公事之轉折，稍有稽延，故今日恐仍不能如期配售。據粉公會人稱：今日如公事到會，可望轉向中央信託局接洽，於一二日內恢筏配售。</p>
<p>又訊：市政當局對麵粉交易，擬採取與食米，食油相同措施，核准自由買賣，改變議價制度。並準備開闢麵粉市塲，實行公開交易，現由該業公會計劃進行。</p>
<p>昨麵粉續有配給，消化呆木，暴跌二萬元，麩皮直綫下瀉，再削五六千元。豆餅賣氣濃厚，回挫三四千元，營口餅劇跌一萬餘元。油市供多於求，跌風最烈，生油豆油慘跌四五六萬元不一，菜油蔴油亦降三四萬元，淸油亦小四萬元。生仁消路甚懈，驟跌二萬元，苞米問津者少，猛挫二萬元，紅糧隨之下跌萬餘元。黄豆油廠納胃尙可，形勢平定。菉豆胃呆少神，疲乏之局。芝蔴洋莊略動，高定次呆。蠶豆平正，赤豆隨各物下降，回跌二萬元，各糧全面下游。</p>

<p>報載輸入管制即將撤銷，進口物資由商人自由設法進口消息，各方極爲重視。據輸管會秘書處長楊惕談，此事尙無所聞，亦無任何意見。又據有關方面所得消息，此事關係重大，於國內金融經濟財政均有影響，當局決不輕易從事，正硏究有效實施辦法。據工商業人士表示，切望政府顧及國內之幼稚工業，不使市塲成爲美貨之尾　。</p>
<h3>外銷茶呆滯　商向各方呼籲</h3>
<p>我國、王要輸出品之茶葉，目前環境，愈趨愈劣，揆其原因，國外來價削小不已，致與華茶生產成本，幾不能以道里計，是以出口久若凍結狀態。尤以卅五年度陳茶，大都均滯留未銷，而茶商鑒於本年度新茶，已屆採製時期，故積極向當局呼籲，要求協助。同時再致電海外，陳訴苦衷，並請酌予寬放茶價，俾資華茶復活，使茶商不致瀕入絕境。至於內銷茶，邇因本街客帮俱有去化，人心不餒，價格方面賣戶雖圖高扳，但在洋莊茶市，疲風連綿中，一時竟無力晋升，結果續呈盤檔局面，然脚地則比前帶堅。</p>
<h3>捲煙繼續下挫　永泰和開始派貨</h3>
<p>昨日捲煙晨開趨疲喊繼續下挫，同業以永泰和烟公司大量派貨關係，銀根軋緊，塲中轉賣頗夥。十支大英牌烟步低至六百六十萬元，午收時回好爲六百六十七萬五千元。下午去化略活，最後價爲六百八十萬元，結果比上日每箱續跌十五萬元。老刀去胃呆頓，猛瀉卅二萬五千元，五華亦小十四萬元。其餘華商各牌烟價，亦呈疲憊。</p>

<h3>在勘察團　出帆前夕　閒談　三平洋上　海防前哨　紅頭嶼</h3>
<p>— 臺北廿四日航訊　本報特派員暮雲</p>
<p>打開全國地圖來看，紅頭嶼祇不過是散處在台灣東部海面的一點，它實麗於太平洋海防的前哨；和團沙·西沙·南沙羣島之中的任何一個小鳥嶼散處在巴士海峽一樣。</p>
<p>這個島嶼，日本人在那裏曾化了一點心血，光復以後，台東縣政府將該島改名蘭嶼，並設立鄕公所，因爲四十九浬的航行困難無法克服，除了蕃人派員划小船到台東來以外，縣府甚至政府就設法派一個人去直到今春，交通處始有船隻，不定期的在東部沿海小島打來回。最近在合灣的科學工作者們，對這個鳥嶼發生了興趣，他們企圖以最新的研究調査，來證實日本人的研究準確性的程度。可以說網羅了有關方面的各個研究員，以該島爲茲點展開全般的立體的勘査，這該是本年度學術界的一樁盛舉。</p>
<p>紅頭嶼純係蕃人基地</p>
<p>紅頭嶼，歐洲人比我們知道得更早，約始於一七二六年。中國宋代出版的諸蕃族誌上的談馬顏就是。淸康熙六十一年台灣御史黄叔璥的台海使槎錄出現了紅頭嶼之名。外人稱之爲BatelTabaga，有烟草島之意。所謂紅頭說者是指像中國形船紅頭船浮在海上之謂。但也有說是晴天自台東海岸眺望，島頂血紅；更有謂係此島蕃民頭髮紅色故稱。</p>
<p>構成該島唯一特徵的是純熱帶島嶼的氣象，一年中的溫度相差很少，最低二十度，室內三十六度，盛夏室外超過四十度時也有。七月至十月是風季，當時有每秒四十公尺的大風。</p>
<p>從地勢上來看，是個海岸綫單調第三世紀海底火山形成的蕃人基地，平面像拳，絕不與外界接觸，也沒有可以停泊的碼頭。在週圍四五·七方籽之間，由西北部的紅頭山（五四七米）和東南端的大森山，（四四〇米）環抱而成的山地，環境和地形，使紅頭嶼成了獨特的原始的地區。</p>
<p>耶眉族　安度如生活</p>
<p>島嶼上最可寳的是住有台灣蕃族中最不開化的種族——耶眉族，從人類學上看來，系目菲列賓的巴坦島（Batan），其體質極像馬來系，與菲洲的或種種族許多褐地方相似，馬來眼，有虹彩帶黑色，毛髮也是黑色，極像台灣本省的拔灣族。但也是全世界僅有的落後民族。</p>
<p>地理環境決定了亞眉族底保守性，外敵的攻略是隔離了，使他自我一族之間一千六七百人，保持了和平無戰爭的生活形態，沒有統治的酋長，沒有階級，在眞自由和眞平等之下，過着原始的個人主義的生活樣式。他們之間的社會制度至爲簡單，深度的的迷信，使他們保持着原有的道德觀念，沒有一般高山族獵頭之風，人們愛稱他們爲世外桃源不知秦晋的人民，正就在此。</p>
<p>這裏沒有幣制，像上海三十多種幣制在他們是視作廢物的，他們採取了最原始的交易方式——以物易物。主要是夜光貝売，海人草及其蕃人製作品，交換着鐵棒。布。鹽。火柴。肥皂和鈕扣，他們特別愛鈕扣。</p>
<p>尊女權　離婚儘可自由</p>
<p>耶眉族也是不飲酒吸烟僅嗜檳榔的民族，他們大部以甘藷·栗·生囂·椰子·香蕉·甘蔗等爲食品，調味很簡單，僅有鹽。祭祀時和婚嫁時，需要用山羊。猪·鷄。這裘最尊重女權，女子可以自由離婚。改嫁三四人，男子則不可能，而且終身不離出生地。</p>
<p>死對於他們是極度的恐怖，除男子外，任何人不敢接觸，送葬時男子全付武裝，鄭重將事，送到海濱叢林中，掘淺土埋葬。</p>
<p>整個島嶼，只有沿海岸有步行的小路，他們從事於簡單的農業和漁牧，圈養着豬和山羊。提起山羊，小紅頭嶼實是山羊的牧塲。他們能自給自足，不需要外來的供給。</p>
<p>他們住在「三層樓」的茅屋裏，祗有一層是透透露在外，還有兩層在山石下面，主要的可以避免暴風雨，但這情調與延安和西北的山洞又不同了。</p>
<p>他們不穿衣衫，每個人都是健康的，是全世界沒有肺結核反應的安全地帶！</p>
<p>大威脅　　風　疾紅蟲</p>
<p>紅頭嶼刻劃着日本人征討的血印，那是明治三十六年十月四日美船航行迷途，其中五人逃到島上，衣服什件均被掠奪，後釀成外交糾紛，旋日人於翌年一月廿七日向島進攻，包圍蕃社，逮捕主事者數十人，並將住屋　去。</p>
<p>日人也就在同時設立警察派出所，有三個警察處理蕃人間的事。有一個蕃童敎育所，用菓子。砂糖。米。衣服等加以引誘後來入學。還有測候所，現在除測候所恢復作爲測魚勵周的指標外，其餘怕還不是短時間能修復的事。</p>
<p>給予該島最大的威脅的是颱風，其次是惡性瘧疾，日本人屢次要開發，終因戰勝不了自然的厄難，遭致失敗。地質調査所派員調査，且有三位犧牲了，還有是最可怕的赤蟲，俗名紅頭蟲，這種虫最愛咬脇下和下部，二三日後敎覺，內有一紅刺，取出即愈，若不取去即發高熱，有生命危險。耶眉族有一種奇特的風俗是盛行拔毛之風。腋下和陰部，以嫻熟的技巧運用四肢夾石的方法拔掉，這是個奇習，亦許是克服紅頭蟲的毒　吧！</p>
<p>兩博士　展開學術風氣</p>
<p>紅頭嶼調査團決於廿五日從基隆以一五〇噸的機帆船出港，海洋學家馬廷英和醫學專家陳禮節負責領導五十餘位各部門的研究工作者，將以三週的長時期對該島作系統的分類研究，包括氣象。熱帶病。農業。地質。海洋。動植物。以及醫學。人類學。民俗學的敎授和學者們，其中有奸幾位是日籍敎授，還有一位是研究溫泉區動植物的德籍敎授希瓦倍。（Schwabe）。</p>
<p>馬廷英和陳禮節都是留日的博士，他倆都深信這一個調査團的舉辦，在中國的科學界，雖不是創舉，但動員了五六十人，大規模的集體的到荒島上去苦苦研究一個時間，却還是破題兒。這些工作者都厭倦了政治，尤其是紛亂的現實，他們集合志趣共通目標同一的，大家向科學方面進攻，希望能造成學術界新風氣。</p>
<p>台灣是具有適合研究的工作環境和條件，對於紅頭嶼，這在國防和科學上都不能放鬆的地帶，顯然將以該團的研究，調査。報吿。表現而獲得珍貴的收穫和提高其在國際間的地位。</p>
<p>「太平洋是我們的！」他們喊着這一個口號冒風險朝向着太平洋國防前哨的紅頭嶼工作地區前進，記者在這裏敬預祝他們成功回來！</p>
<p>蕃人所乘船隻帆時，絕對禁止婦子接近，更禁帶婦女任何用品，並須由眾望所歸者操舵。　（本報特派員江暮雲寄）</p>
<h3>一縷青煙　增進菸葉產量　培養國家稅源</h3>
<p>— 開封十八日航訊　季帆</p>
<p>我國各種菸葉產量，據三十五年度統計，共約爲十五億磅，而能製造捲菸之烤菸產量，則僅九千五百餘萬磅。依此計算，僅能製捲烟六十萬箱。若以全國十分之一人口吸捲烟計，每人每支捲烟應維持十五小時方可敷用，自爲事實上所不可能。</p>
<p>刻據一般估計：每年我國最少需捲烟二百萬箱，因之大批捲烟成品及菸葉原料，均不得不仰紿於舶來品，而百分之九十以上，皆來自美國。卅五年度，除捲烟外，僅菸葉一項，輸入達三百四十八億，約二千二百萬元美金。以今日之匯率計算，平均每分鐘流出國外之國幣之數為五十三萬元。</p>
<p>今年照經濟委員會公佈之限額菸葉進口一二期各三個月，各爲八百萬美金，平均每分鐘流出國幣數爲七十五萬元，而捲菸輸入皆不在內。此一縷靑烟，於不知不覺之一瞬間，即形成吾國最大漏巵之一，實不容忽視。</p>
<p>菸草一物，雖非生活之絕對必需品，但已爲日常不可缺少之物，殆屬無可否認之事實。且國家稅收，卅五年度菸葉稅達二千六百餘億，即每分鐘收入六十萬元，今年預計可達一萬億以上，即每分鐘最少可收二百元，是菸草又為國家之重要稅源。</p>
<p>農林部菸產改進處爲增進生產，改良品質，杜絕漏巵，培養稅源，刻已大規模展開菸產改進工作，如時局安定，三年內可能達到自給自足之境，並望能有餘額輸出，換取外匯。査我國烤菸生產，產量品質，均以河南爲最，山東次之，安徽又次之。本年以山東局勢未臻安定，一於產改進一處之工作，乃先行在豫皖兩省開展，山東則僅在靑島作小規模試騐，而以大部力量，集中河南。據本年初步估計，該處情况至爲良好，栽培面積，可達到八十萬畝左右，較去年增加二成至三成，菸產前途，殊堪樂觀。</p>
<h3>熱帶果園</h3>
<p>— 福州十四日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>天氣慢慢地熱了，我們會想到啖着甜蜜蜜的水果以止渴。江南雖爲魚米之鄉，但是水果究不及靠近熱帶的福建。福建東南部得氣候土壤之宜，水果繁衍，產果的面積幾達全境三分之一，有熱帶果園」之稱。果類之多，產量之富，又殆非台灣，廣東可與倫比。每年以各種鮮果或製成果乾供給國內各省，數以十數萬祖。</p>
<p>果品　季節</p>
<p>閩產的水果，無慮數十種，著名如橙，橘，龍眼荔枝，柚，桃，李，枇杷，香蕉，柿，黄淡，橄欖，楊桃，棗，甘庶，楊梅，葡萄，芒果，山楂，荸薺等。有些且爲國內稀有之果品，這些水果每年輪流生產，且看果品季節：一月橙子黄；二月香蕉熟；三月枇杷市；四月楊梅止渴；五月桃李天下；六月荔枝紅；七月龍眼季；八月黄淡旺；九月柿登塲；十月柚子香；十一月橘報冬。</p>
<p>福州　福橘</p>
<p>閩果出口，向以福橘爲大宗。福橘產於福州，林森，橘淸各地，皮薄汁多而甜，比汕頭橘强，保有「橘王」之地位。戰前平均每年可產三十五萬担，上乘者運銷京滬。橘產於冬天，立冬後橘色嬌紅欲滴，福橘上市殆爲過年應景。抗戰時期，福州，福淸各地因糧會恐慌，農民被迫伐橘樹種稻，橘的產量頓形銳减，去年十一月後，福橘運銷上海，每月只近萬担，每担價格低者六萬元，高者十萬元，工海十六舖三山會館即爲福橘外銷的貿易所，橘除解食外，以刀去皮在日光下晒乾，謂之「橘紅」，味極香甜，上海稻香村以此製藥。</p>
<p>龍眼　荔枝</p>
<p>莆田盛產荔枝與龍眼，故有「荔城」之稱。俗有「摘龍眼之萬顆，啖荔枝之三百」之豪興。莆田之荔枝品種絕佳，福州，泉州，漳州雖亦產荔，惟質絞差。此樹爲常綠喬木，高可二三丈，樹影團如帷蓋，葉爲羽狀複葉，六月結實，此果畏霜雪，僅宜予亞熱帶或熱帶種植，如開花時西風起則不易結實，且特忌麝香，遇之花實盡落，荔枝不適于遠行，蓋易爛熱，莆田人以其製成荔枝乾，俗稱元香，運銷江南華北，戰前平均每年可產三萬担，如以目下時價一斤一千元計，可値三十萬萬元，而勝利後的去年，產量銳减，僅出四千餘担，荔枝焙製商皆虧累不堪。</p>
<p>漳州　文旦</p>
<p>柚子亦爲常綠筒木，樹高于橘，宜植于瘴癘之地，漳州出產最多，厦門次之，漳產皮薄，肉甜汁多，堪稱當世寄種。大者稱「彭山」，小者稱「文且」，享有盛名，行銷于省內及南洋香港。以前閩南婦女曾用刨刀把柚樹的柚木取下，當做髮膠，俗稱「美人膠」，傳爲美談。</p>
<p>他如福州，連江的橙，現正大量植種中；林森之橄欖，入齒淸脆，運銷江南；福州之崑桃，品種特佳；閩東各縣的李，製成「李　」，運銷海內外，港人稱爲「嘉應子」；林森，永泰等縣所產的柿，除鮮食外，製成柿丸及柿餅，販運各地銷售；閩東南各縣的烏紅棗，枇杷，荸齊，甘蔗等水果戰前全部輸出每年在百萬元以上。</p>
<p>一　菓園</p>
<p>水果爲閩省農村主要副產之一，農民每于農閒時栽植果樹，以補晨價物收入之不足。植果每年須換土施肥始克有成，果產有旺年，淡年之別，相互交替，以福建去年果產凋零情况視之，今年閩果生產當屬旺盛之年。惟邇來農村經濟窒息，農民多無能力購買新種仔與肥料以繁植其果園，且虫害堪虞，果產收益損害甚大，農民無奈其何？閩東南一帶，于抗戰時期，以地當沿海要衝，交通路綫破壞者十之八九，以致如仙遊，莆田，福淸，漳州，泉州等地之果區內果產遍地，無法大量運出，任其腐爛，貨棄于地，殊堪惋惜。如運轍，冷藏，肥料等問題可以解決，福建的確可以成爲由國第一大果園。</p>
<h3>關於留英中華海軍</h3>
<p>編者先生：頃閱五月十一日貴報第七版留英中華海軍通訊一篇，內容甚覺詳確，與舍弟去年春間來函所吿，情形大致相同。舍弟係卅四年十一月離渝飛印轉英，係第一批五十名軍官之一，現在倫敦附近之Chatham皇家　海軍槍砲學校實習，一俟學業修畢，好將擔任今春抵英之第二批學兵等之槍砲敎官，約今夏可駕艦「震旦號」回國。據渠見解，其中艦名似應譯訂如下：</p>
<p>（一）Renown（一名譽號」）35，000噸，15吋砲六門，係英戰鬥巡洋艦三艘中之一艘。另一　　ook號，爲德艦「俾斯麥號」在大西洋擊沉。又一艘Repulse「抗拒號」已在新加坡，被日機擊沉。「名準號艦」已退役，專作訓練海軍之用，並非「航空母艦冒險號」（Adventure）</p>
<p>（二）Aurora（「曙光號」）是原名，贈我國後始改名「震旦號」，係5.720噸之輕巡洋艦。（以下從略）鄙人高光宇啓（五，十二，昆明）</p>

<p>編輯先生：本月十七日中午，有身穿工裝，隨帶修電工具之靑年一人，自稱係某電料行派來應召修理電表，逕登鄙寓四川中路騰鳳里五十一號三樓，彼時適爲合宅炊飯時間，各房客以三樓電燈無障礙，加以拒絕，彼乃回至二樓，將房客自備之分表，偸去逃逸無蹤。因二樓房客分表俱裝置房門口，適該戶無人出進，致被盜云，估計時値約在四十萬元左右。深恐小醜一次得手，嗣後勢必大施其技，査騰鳳里內，泰半爲公司，坐莊，行號，弄禁頗嚴，尙且如此，其他里弄，更無論矣，望有關當局密切注意，並希市民隨時警覺，免受損失。（君然）</p>

<h3>宜興醫院藥品太缺</h3>
<p>我是一個小公務員，自去年五月六日我回宜省親，誰知於八日中午我的七齡孩子由學校回家，忽然發起熱來了，小孩發熱並不是件嚴重的事，所以給他吃了些消炎片，呌他睡覺，當時並不呻吟，不過夜間熱度甚高，九日早晨我就抱到宜興公立醫院求治，據醫師診爲猩紅熱症，須注射猩紅熱血淸，但該院未備此項藥品，囑我自行購買，誰知跑遍全宜興城及私人開業西醫處，沒有這樣藥品，上無錫汽車已開走了，坐輪船來個須二天，所以決定明天坐公路車上無錫治療，當日下午我的孩子病就轉劇，眼向上翻，抽筋，在病念當兒，由鄰居找了針科打針，針科只是搖頭沒有辦法，只得又送進公立醫院請求院長設法急救，注射配尼西林及强心針，終歸無效，延至當日下午八時在醫院病故。査我兒之死，並非病不能救，實在因爲宜興沒有救治他的藥，如果宜興公立醫院有是項猩紅熱血淸，我孩子何，至於死，這樣又胖又健的孩童使病一日有半夭亡，實令人痛心，我兒死不足惜，不過宜興公立醫院醫藥如此缺乏，全宜興數萬小孩得了傳染病何以搶救，束手待斃嗎？實是一個大問題，小孩是國家未來的主人翁，我們再不能將他的小生命糟榻了，我要爲全宜興的小孩呼籲，請求旅滬的同鄉們仁慈的大慈善家們，捐助些傳染病特效藥如猩紅熱血淸，腦膜炎血淸，白喉等等藥品，贈給宜興公立醫院，以造福人羣，同時希望該院負實人對於這些藥品亦需準備，總之我的孩子是因爲無藥而犧牲了，不要別的孩子再像我孩子一樣遭受了不幸的厄運，所以我只有含淚沉痛的代全宜興數萬小孩呼籲！並希望其他次等城市的醫院也應力求美備！（吳菊生）</p>
<h3>中山公園樹上有釘</h3>
<p>編輯先生：中山公園之樊石亭西首，有許多雪松大樹，該園管理人因兒童爬樹，竟用鐵釘密釘樹上，此種望之不見觸之受傷之手段，亟盼工務局設法改善，並請本市有兒童之家長注意，設或不幸觸及，不特刺傷，並恐有跌墜危險。即就樹木而言，亦恐易於萎謝也。（錢能訓）</p>

<h3>春天的氣候</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>吳書記從家裏跑出來，一看太陽已高，知道時候不早了，兩脚加快地走着。</p>
<p>他的身子相當瘦弱，兩個肩顯高聳着，大槪是伏案寫字，寫久了的關係吧。一個扁扁的頭，戴了一頂舊呢帽，看上去好像一個　似的，那細長的　莖——他的頸項，在搖擺着，使人担心它會折斷。</p>
<p>他穿了一件黑布棉袍，袍子的衣袖，衣領，和下擺都已起了毛。袖底和屁股坐的地方，發着光亮，像鐘子一樣。袍子的中腰有兩條縫，這因爲袍子嫌短，特地添了布，把它接長些；兩旁鑲着闊邊，這因爲袍子嫌瘦小，特地添了布把兩旁擴充出來的。</p>
<p>三月的太陽，照在身上，覺得很暖熟，加以他又走了一段急路，汗點在他的背心裏，臉頰上……偷偸地爬着。</p>
<p>「熟了，棉袍不能穿了！」他這樣一想，他的脚步不由地滯緩下來。他關心到馬路上，行人們的身上都已除去了冬裝，棉袍已經變成稀有之物了。</p>
<p>他愈走，愈覺得負在身上的，不是棉袍，而是一面木枷。馬路上只要有人向他望一望，總覺得那投來的都是一種議刺的輕蔑的眼光。</p>
<p>三個摩登女子，在他對面走過來，她們都穿了短短的春裝，有一個竟把胖的臂膀都露出來了。她們三個人並排地走着，在吳書記看來，簡直是有力的三支軍，在對他爾來，他沒有勇氣走向前去，脚在踟躇着。</p>
<p>當她們和他接近的時候，吳書記因爲急要讓路，一陣心慌，身子不由自主地在左右搖擺。引得三個女子發出一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>「她們在笑我，在笑我，一定是笑我的衣裳……」他在自言自語着，臉頰已在發燒。</p>
<p>他氣吁吁地跑進辦公室，見到許多同事都已換了衣裝，尤其坐在窗邊的那個「室花」——女同志，今天只穿了一件薄薄的大紅袷袍，胸前挺得高高的。</p>
<p>他把舊呢帽除下，順手抹下一把汗，就埋頭坐下，拔出一技小字筆，預備抄公文，可是全身在冒火，一顆心無論如何不得寗靜，額上的汗點，直滴在公文紙上。公文上的黑字兒都變了……衣裳……春天……三個女人……紅袷袍……等字樣，跳進他的眼鎌。</p>
<p>「喂，吳同志，你要做制服哦？」室花走到他面前，把一件徵求做制服的通知，和一塊呢樣，放在他面前：「很便宜，三十萬做一套制服，大職員分兩個月扣還，小職員分三個月扣……」</p>
<p>「是！是！等我看一下！」他捧了通知和呢樣在翻覆地看了一息。室花不耐煩，仍舊退回到窗口坐位。</p>
<p>——我月薪只有十四萬，每月扣去十萬，餘下只有四萬，這四萬元能够一家開銷嗎？</p>
<p>——不做，那末水遠都不能做了！</p>
<p>他想來想去，想了多時，還不能決定。他把筆桿兒，只管擦着頭皮，許多頭皮屑兒紛紛地落下來。</p>
<p>最後他還是把通知送還給室花。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？」室花問着，睜着一雙亮眼，瞥了一下他的黑棉袍。</p>
<p>「我……再考慮一下」……他囁嚅地說出這幾個字，並且扭動一下他的細頸項。</p>
<p>「我知道了，老吳見怕太太的，一定要回去呈報太太核定呢」！旁邊一個同事故意地向他調侃。</p>
<p>他慘笑一下，仍舊回到自己坐位上。</p>
<p>每到季節的替換的當兒，差不多總是使他煩惱的時候。</p>
<p>因爲節變了，氣候也變了，而他穿的衣裳也不得不跟着變換一下。</p>
<p>可是他是一個小書記，每月拿的薪水，他要養活妻女和自己，把三個肚子塡飽了，已經感到非常吃力，那裏還有餘錢，再做衣裳。</p>
<p>沒辦法，他只有靠了這一件黑布袍子，過了四個秋，四個冬，和三個春。</p>
<p>每次季節快要變換時，他總會生出一個希望：我必須在下季換一件衣掌，但希望與事實脫了節，事實上，這件黑袍子。好像和他結了不解緣，不願意離開他。</p>
<p>他一方面非常嫌惡這件袍子，甚至還要兜詛它；另一方面，它總算是一件長袍，他要在「長袍隊伍」裏混下去，他仍得要愛護它。</p>
<p>「老鼠身上有一層皮，我的身上有一件黑衣，萬一我的這件黑衣，在一個釘上扯了一個洞，那我就不能混了」！他曾經這樣地想過。</p>
<p>有時他羡慕那些苦力的人們：「他們多好，穿一身短衣裳，儘管破爛一點，也不要緊！長袍子有什麼用」？</p>
<p>話雖是這麼說，他究竟不能穿了短衫袴跑進辦公室。</p>
<p>現在，天氣一天天的和暖，人們大都以笑臉來歡迎春天的季候，只有他，他的心一天憂鬱一天。</p>
<p>他在這一季，仍舊不能添製衣裳，他仍舊穿着這件黑色的袍子，預備渡過第四個春天，不過裏面的棉花已經抽去，棉袍已變成袷袍了。</p>
<p>春天的氣候是多變的，有一夜，忽然起了大風，天氣驟寒，吳書記，來不及把棉花裝還袍子裏去，他勉强地抗拒着寒氣，可是抗了兩天，他病下來了。</p>
<h3>友情　—「自由談月刋」編後作</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>敎書，寫稿，編雜誌，像壓根兒喜歡這一套，也許就是關於友情上嚶求情緒的出發，却是離開了會覺得寂寞的。「夜談」只編了三個月，爲了某一種原故而中止。一年了，寂寞侵襲着我，混跡在車塵煤烟的圈子裏，消磨着，不知所以地。</p>
<p>這是偶然的會合，朋友要弄一個雜誌，我竟然答應了，偶然成了竟然的主因，不過想把寂寞久了的空虛的心重投入友情暖爐，但是白天得奔走生計的，我沒有煞興，在夕陽斜過江面，或者暮色籠住樹梢之際，還可獲得友情的陶融，這樣，「自由談」產生了。</p>
<p>也可以說在我數十寒者的短促生命里程上該劃下不忘的一頁，因爲人世間唯有友情是溫煦的，溫煦而至於偉大。這之間，除了趙景深魏金枝胡山源錢君匋陳伯吹等幾位老友自然沒有間題的帮忙，以及葉遐翁題了「裏括須彌芥子筆飛雨風雷霆」的詞句，　子愷從杭州畫一幅特稿來之外，新的友情更給我以無上的鼓舞，而在拉稿經過的風絲談片，似乎是値得一記的。</p>
<p>最先，我想起了施蟄存，螫存和我是神交，他新舊文學都有獨造，當輾轉內地時做了很多舊詩，我也一樣。這八年的離憂抑塞之昔，集成了「一塵草」寄他看，那時他將到徐州去結束江蘇學院的未了課務，寫信給我說其中的「捲土頌」「直抉江西神髓」，這我不敢當，但他用的宣紙箋，那麼勁逸的墨寳，我一直珍藏着。是黄香已經深了，我第一到他的曁南宿舍去，淡淡的燈光下，他一張張抽了許多的詩給我看，寫詩的紙是特備的，好像有「無相庵」的記號。沒有幾天，就接到了他的稿子，却是「無相庵隨筆」是關於詩話的，他說其次寫詞，或歌，想把這一類來一下有系統的討論。接着，我認識了戴望舒，望舒和蟄存　樣的豪邁不羈談着天，又那麽藹然地。他兼了曁南和師專兩校的課，很煩瑣，但一口肯定帮忙。他曉得我白天的工作，奇怪的說：「怎麽你到踏進這樣圈子呢？」是的，我消磨在充滿商儈氣息的圈裏，所以嫌寂寞了，想再揑起筆桿來，我照樣報之微笑，這答語沒有說出。</p>
<p>上海很少看到謝冰瑩的文章，我要她寫一點通訊，在未接着她北平通訊「這不是春天」以前，回信說一定給我寫，就這一句話，我深深感到欣幸，因爲她編着幾個刊物，又要敎書，實在忙不過來，「這不是春天」中也提起「淸閣問她是否想回上海」，趙淸閣女士，她正埋頭寫着長篇小說，對外稿擱筆已久了，承她情也趕了一篇給我，當坐在她樓上讀蕭田漢那苜詩，很想和一首，可就只記了「淸閣翩翩似健男」的一韻。</p>
<p>不久，稿子雖已差不多，而却發生了其他的困難，雖然「自由談」是出版了我的心仍舊沉下去，回復到寂寞。我怕徒然辜負友情的溫煦。</p>
<h3>近代劇之父—易卜生</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>近代劇之父易卜生（一八二八——一九〇六），在本年五月廿三日是他死祭四十一週年的紀念，這位孤獨的前驅者思想的光輝，到今日仍顯耀於吾人的眼前。</p>
<p>易卜生是挪威人，但他一生放逐在異國的日子較多，直到老年，過七十濤辰時才受到國人熟烈的歡迎，使得這位老人感觸旣往，雖滿面笑顏，可是同時淚如雨下。的確的，易卜生是一個時代前驅者，他反對旣成社會一切的腐爛，虛詐，他擁護自由，眞理。他個人不惜向不合理的法律，道德，宗敎及婚姻宣戰，他一生劇作以表達他的思想爲先，他戰鬥，繼續前進，決不後退；社會的冥頑不靈也繼續着它的鄙陋的攻擊。他要醫治這個病態社會，製造未來健全的後嗣，他的作品是絕對愛慕人道，自由，幸福，確是歐洲自由思想的前驅！</p>
<p>本來，一個先知先覺者無不是最初見拒於羣衆，甚至被認爲叛逆；其後，社會腐爛以至於崩潰而需要重新違造時，這叛逆，常又被歡迎爲神明。因此，易卜生的思想，走入個人主義的原因之一，便由於他所敏感地見到形將崩潰的舊社會，指出其病源，無奈時人習於「旣成」禮制，反控爲異端，因而他產生了「天下最强有力的人便是最孤獨的人」與「少數黨常常是對的，多數黨常常是錯的」極度個人英雄主義，似乎反民主的理論，其實他的議論，正爲籌辯當時社會盲目攻擊而發。而這「個人」也必然是先知者，而所謂「多數人」必指愚昧的羣衆而言。他感於當時社會羣衆之盲從，他個人指示出的見解不爲羣衆接受，而個人意志，自由，與幸福，爲一切席偽的席俗的欺詐所蒙蔽，所腐蝕；所以他才有自由思想的產生。</p>
<p>他的四大社會問題劇開寫實主義劇之先河！「傀儡的家庭」是震動全世界爲女性爭取人格的名著，但因爲社會反攻他，所以他又寫出「羣鬼」來解答；社會越發攻擊他，所以他再寫「國民公敵」來解答。社會更激烈地反抗他，他最後寫出了「野鴨」，他說：「不要揭破虛偽，不然，你的幸福也要同時歸於消滅。」可是事實上吿訴人們：「生命如流水，其意義與價値，在浩浩蕩蕩向前衝。海闊天空的野鴨，一受打擊，便沒落水底，永不再起；——養在後樓的，洗着槽裏的水，安之若棄，忘其所以，嗚呼哀哉！」這是對安於虛僞欺詐忘却自由幸福人們的一大諷刺！</p>
<p>易卜生的一生是戰鬥過來的，由於客觀環境的刺激與內在個性的固執，完成他從反抗中求取人類幸福的偉大意志，他雖爲寫實劇之父，少年及晚年作風中仍染有浪漫的色彩；原因是他讚美自然，窮究眞理，崇尙個性人格，所以目前在這樣虛詐混亂的社會中紀念這位近代劇的大師易卜生却仍舊有其偉大的意義！</p>
<h3>牆</h3>
<p>— 臧贊</p>
<p>鳥的家是矗立於空中的高岩，是溶解於天空的樹梢，或是懸掛於空中的鳥架，只有更小而爲人蓄養的鳥才住在籠裏，但是却還一樣晒到太陽，呼吸到空氣。而人呢？人住在四週圍着高牆的家裏，行走在牆與牆之間的路上。</p>
<p>一天，我同朋友進城買車票，因爲他第二天又要離開這個城市到北方去了，買了票就在街上作了次最後的巡視，一直到天黑（朋友同我來到這個城市都沒有好久，如今他又要走了。處處都有新的遭遇，新的希望，我不能跟他離開這裏，我自然更不能拉他留在這裏。）我們儘找那平日不常走的路走着，越走越黑。</p>
<p>尤如烏雲襯出了閃電；燈光襯出了黑夜。在黑夜裏，看得淸的看不淸了，醜的變美了，陳舊的變新鮮了。我們遊巡於瞎子的琴聲裏，小食攤的燈光裏，還有那些說書，賣唱的……我們忘了時間，一直到午夜。</p>
<p>—或許不是午夜——一直到我們迷失了方向。</p>
<p>我們越走越冷寂，走近了一片高牆，高而且長，看不見盡頭，我們離牆遠遠地走，牆壁發着可怕的冷氣，好像隨時可以倒下來一樣——誰也不信這麼高的牆可以持久。但我們心都不否認這是新鮮的遭遇，是那一位有錢的財主將自己關在裏面？但他爲什麼連一個門窗都不造呢？（只是牆。）爲什麽又做得這樣高呢？好像圍着這高牆打了幾個圈子，我們終於找到了一個門——像個城門，而上面寫着字：</p>
<p>「監獄」</p>
<p>在這烏黑的大門面前，不容考慮，我們立刻在街的對面找了個小巷，溜了進去，連脚步聲都不敢響出。</p>
<p>如像走入了惡夢，四週都已爲魔鬼安排就了，走出這不知名的小巷，又是一座高牆，又是一座陰森的大門，門上一盞强光的大燈，白得發綠，一個荷槍的兵土直立在這强光中，又是一個監獄：</p>
<p>「軍人監獄」</p>
<p>我們再沒有勇氣朝前走了；不只是怕跑進監獄，也怕朋友明天啓程時起不了早，我們問了第一個碰見的路人，他把我們回家的路吿訴了我們——這依然是條不熟悉的路。我們低頭走着，沒有說話，只是想，而且知道都想着一個題目，想找話說，又怕反而擾亂了對方的思緒。</p>
<p>前面又是一排高牆，這牆更蒼老，更空虛，好像裏面只是一片荒野，連小草都難於生長的，永遠照射不到陽光的荒野……可是我們却聽見裏面確有聲息，像風，像嘆息——但又不像一個人單獨的嘆息，而是千萬人的；低沉而且衆多。我們尋找那大門上的字，那是寫於血紅的底子上的，金色的字：</p>
<p>「神學院」</p>
<p>啊！那不是嘆息，那不是風聲，是讚美的歌聲，是鐘的响聲。嘆息却是我們自己。</p>
<p>我們依然向前走，大約已經過了午夜，我們走到了自己所熟知的路。一路上碰見了許多類似的高牆，有的是院宅，有的是寺院，有的還是監獄。</p>
<p>回家的路很長，而且需要越過一片大草地。幸好是熟路，在野地裏，大家吐了一口氣。第一句話，朋友說：</p>
<p>「都是牆，都是牆。」</p>
<p>我黯然了。我感到孤寂。明天，朋友坐了火車，還要坐輪船到海洋上去的。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血520</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「那是個什麽「道德」哪……換句話，中國不就是誤在這種道德上的？」鶴見拿出了日本『軍國民』敎育的眼光來說話了。</p>
<p>「您這麽說，我得請教一句話：誰賦給您這殺人的主權…無論是個人或是一個國家？」</p>
<p>「個人方面，當然有國家的法律行使權主持着…」</p>
<p>「那麼，國家方而，也是有國際公法的行使權主持着的哪，…可是國際公法是誰創立的？…現在誰又在規規矩矩地守着國際公法行事？誰承認過國際仲裁的存在，除了假借名義以外？」</p>
<p>「對哪，所以才需要製造武器來打擊武器，用戰爭來弭平戰爭哪！」鶴見應用日本的軍國侵略思想，和詭辯的方式來挫折守一的理論「您一個人空口空手，想要主持道義，可是現在的世界，走到了武力第一，强權至上的時代，您一人固執着紀元以前「老死不相往還」的作風，做一個禮讓之邦，在現代優勝劣敗的條件下，說得好聽些，您是在表演一個『殉道者』的姿態；事實上，您是在招引人家來侵略，乾脆在等着做亡國奴哪！」</p>
<p>「您想這麼慢吞吞地，一步一步，龜步化，牛步化地走去，可以來得及趕上時代嗎？」鶴見的幻想中，似乎看見了日本的大軍，已軍黑壓壓地横掃過來，眼見就要把中國搗成一團糟，遠一點的高麗，近一點的東北，更近一點，就是盧溝橋之戰以後的華北，就是一個例子。</p>
<p>「來不及也得這麽幹……孟子說過：「七年之病，欲求三年之艾，苟不爲著，到終身不可得。」您要曉得，文化的階段，天然得一步一步走上去，只能捒直徑走得快些，却不能歪曲，　等，跨越。小日本就是犯了這個歪曲跨越的毛病。您想一個野蠻民族，赤膊着身子，滿腦筋的活剝生吃思想，呌他們僅僅披上一　西式大禮服，就可算得文明民族嗎？就應該侵略人家嗎？……」</p>
<p>「練習武功，也是如此：必得從基礎上做起，先把臟腑練得堅實起來，才能操練筋骨皮膚。照您說「來不及」，似乎就應該先學兩下殺手……固然也可學得成功；一旦交起手來，也許可以一下把人打倒，可是自已的內藏，也要大大受傷，甚至還是致命之傷。萬一一下打人不倒，那可更糟咧……」</p>
<p>「噓！」……</p>
<p>守一一方面駕着車說着話，一方面還在留心沿路的情形，這時忽然聽得路邊來了一聲尖脆的唿哨，知道是自己人的警號，曉得距離虹鎭近了，便把車子速度减低，一面也嘬口「噓」地一聲，放出暗號。</p>
<p>這聲暗號一放出，立刻就聽到前面不遠「噓吁……噓呼……」兩下反應。這個反應。表示已到警戒範圍以內了。守一聽到這個警號，立即把車煞住；因爲地區冷落，時間已晚，往來並無行人，便就在在馬路當地，把車倒回頭來，停在路邊。剛待招呼鶴見下車，忽地瞥苦前面屋簷脚下，有人影晃動。</p>
<h3>易卜生的處女作</h3>
<p>— 李士珉</p>
<p>易卜生（Henrik　Ibsen）十四歲時就開始在一間藥店裏當學徒。一八四八年的歐洲正是革命思潮澎湃的時候，年靑的易卜生，還只有二十歲，對於這種思想很崇拜。爲了要讚美革命，他決定從事創作，由是每晚都秉燭寫稿，直至深夜然後住筆。經過兩年的工夫，才完成了處女作三慕悲劇詩——「卡蒂蓮納」（Catilina　）。到了一八五一年，懷着一顆要做藝術家的心，他脫離了十年墨徒的生活，跨出藥店。此後，首先將那本「卡蒂運納」交托與他的一位友人用匿名自費出版。可是出版後，總共祗銷售了三十餘册。</p>
<h3>梅蘭</h3>
<p>— 陳從周</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>小時候，那還是在小學讀書的時候。</p>
<p>很偶然地在封神榜演義中，翻到兩句詩。這十四個字很深刻地印入我的腦海。詩曰：「我本將心託明月，誰知明月照溝渠。」</p>
<p>我至今還想不起，在當時我有怎樣了不起的憂愁？小小年紀已經深深地意識到人世的蒼凉。</p>
<p>我想愛深思的人，必定善感。而這光怪的人世，有許多問題是不能索解，亦不必索解的。</p>
<p>醜惡的現實，不能容納莊嚴的思想；肉慾的生活把靈魂的活動拋得多遠啊。</p>
<p>幼年的生活環境，往往能給予人們各個不同的想像力。譬如墨索里尼是一個鐵匠的兒子，鐵匠的工塲義成了他底想像力，他曾向魯特維希說：「鐵砧和火，啓示我以一種憑自己的意志來鑄造東西的熱情。」</p>
<p>我想這位魔王之所以爲魔王，也許正因爲缺乏康德之類底哲學觀念，作爲他熟情的引導。</p>
<p>熱情和火一樣，在予施用得當。</p>
<p>不以人廢言。</p>
<p>魔也有適一個頗爲動人的故事：</p>
<p>「一天晚上，老墨　火中燒，他看見一家人在日內瓦湖邊飯店花園裏安詳地用着豐盛的晚餐。他驚訝於自己竟有了乞食之念，毅然跑開了，雖則那時他　中不名一文。這時他寫給他朋友一封很動人的信：「我放棄了一切記憶，甚至於理想也放棄了。」</p>
<p>後來他追憶前事，很黯然地望着遠處，他對一個外國朋友說：「飢餓是良師，幾乎與敵人一樣良　作爲一個社會主義的我，前途是敞開的。監獄是良好的學校，監獄如海。人在海上可以學得忍耐。」</p>
<p>於是他歷數在四個國度裏所入過的十一個監獄，而稱之爲難得的鍛鍊身體的塲所。</p>
<p>我說的自然是指墨索里尼的思想還沒有墮落，還沒有投入浮士德底懷抱之前的故事。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>卓別林的諷刺</h3>
<p>— 虛丹</p>
<p>卓別林的新片「浮度世先生」新近已在美國上演，大約不久就會運到中國來的，「文摘」一五一期對此片已有詳盡的介紹。在這影片中，卓別林一反過去的滑帶作風，却特別注重人物個性的刻劃，並竭力强調諷刺現實的鏡頭。我之對「浮度世先生」頗有興趣，倒是因爲從卓別林的諷刺，聯想起「人妖案」中大名鼎鼎的「沈五爺」來了。</p>
<p>浮度世先生是個什麽樣的人物呢？</p>
<p>依據「文摘」的介紹，我們可以知道他是一個中年的法國銀行職員，在一次經濟不景氣喪失了業，他十分愛他的妻子和小孩，但在經濟麻痺狀態之下，他無法找到職業，保障他們的安全，於是他爲百己打了一條出路：做一個謀殺者。他犧牲的對象是愚蠶有錢的女人。他的工作並不容易，他的追求她們，與她們結婚，然後謀殺她們。這種工作雖然可厭，但他也從中得到了一些樂趣。每完成一種「嫌錢」的工作，便回到他可愛的家裏，使自己鬆弛一下，直到麵包問題再逼迫他出來幹殺人的勾當。</p>
<p>這是一個並未完全喪失「人性」的人，很像巴爾扎克筆下的大盜「伏脫冷」，後者並不想做殺人越貨的勾當，然而在巴黎這樣一個「竊國者侯，竊鈎者的誅」的社會裏，他終於以竊盜爲終身生涯了。</p>
<p>一個善良的人，一個强者，一個尙未完全失去理智的人，當他發現了拜金社會的不合理，要想求生，却不知道如何獲取麵包；有所憎恨，却看不淸憎恨的對象，不知道該如何發洩他的憤怒。在這情形下，他自然可能向弱者或愚魯者進攻的，浮度世先生是卓別林的幻想人物嗎？並不，卓別林雖誇大了浮度世先生的性格，畢竟仍有現實的依據，否則，這諷刺片的落脚點苜先太虛幻了，還談什麽諷刺呢？</p>
<p>不久前，美國聯合社報導的</p>
<p>一個戲劇式殺人新聞，其中主角釀酒商哈里斯的行徑，即大有浮度世先生的作風。哈里斯因女友失約，乃在偶然的邂逅中殺害了另一少女潘西爾，誠然，他有他的報復動機，但他竟選擇了一個無辜的可憐蟲下手，却實在殊出一般人之意料。</p>
<p>不看淸對象而胡亂報復，有時不免要鬧大笑話的。浮度世先生的可憫，不在他的報復主義，而是在於他做了「謀殺者」，却還竭力想維護他的「良知」。</p>
<p>「沈五爺」也可能是個報復主義者吧，她首先是某名流的小妾，其後被棄，又其後就以男裝出現，並且收羅了不少豪門大戶的小妾，看樣才，當初他人怎樣玩弄她，現在她也就怎樣玩弄她們。</p>
<p>這只是我的揣測，「沈五爺」是未必肯承認的，但讀了「文摘」中的卓別林影片的評介，我很自然地有了這聯想。</p>

<h3>即將登台串演平劇之北平李麗</h3>
<h3>讀豐子愷先生的「懷太虛法師」</h3>
<p>— 黃華</p>
<p>在太虛法師沒有圓寂以前，社會上對於他，可以說是毀譽參半；五體投地祟拜他的，固然不計其數；而誤解他懷疑他甚至於毀謗他誣栽他的，却也不少；筆者就是曾經誤解過他的，記得民國十年前後，我在狄楚靑先生主辦的時報館當主筆，前輩詩人陳子言先生，會經把我的幾首五言詩，採進他的大著「尊　室詩話」，登載在時報的附刋文藝週刋上，後來太虛法師主辦的海潮音雜誌，把這幾首詩轉載，我看見了這一期的海潮音，很不高興，援筆在他的封面上寫了兩句說：政治和尙的機關報，如何轉載我的詩？從這一點可以想見當時我對於太虛法師的觀念。</p>
<p>到民國十五年，太虛法師車錫在上海某寺的下院，有個學佛的朋友，邀我一同去看他，當時我對於太虛法師的觀念，已經漸次轉變了，因爲我曾經和他通過一次信，覺得他和藹可親的緣故。但是我仍然向那個朋友說：太虛法師是不是和一般老法師一樣，要人家磕頭禮拜呢？他說，不！不！太虛法師是非常隨和的。我於是乎和他一同去了，見面之後，我的感想，可以說是和豐子愷先生的感想，一般二，從此無我便追隨了太虛法師二十多年，一直到他圓寂。</p>
<p>太虛法師的智慧，眞是舉世無匹，他對於世出世法，無不通達，無論你提出任何問題，他都有適當的解答，無論辦一甚麽事，他都有周密的規畫。</p>
<p>太虛法師是集佛學的大成的，他的造詣，在智顫法藏之上，他的理論，比他們要圓滿得多，他確實是對於佛法認識得最正確的，是得佛法的眞髓的。</p>
<p>太虛法師的慈悲，也是空前絕後的，他可以說是無緣慈悲的體現，通體是慈悲，像火通體是熱。大垂佛教，以大悲救世爲根本，講到救世，便不能與世間絕緣，假如離開世間，那就像離開井去救井裏面的人一樣，試問如何救法，太虛法師的周旋於政治社會之間，便是他大悲心的流露，可惜社會上淺見的太多了。</p>
<p>豐先生說：「崇德怎麽會出這樣的一個人」？請進一步說：現代的世界—尤其是中國，怎麽會出這樣的一個人？</p>
<p>最近我有「讀太虛法師遺詩」一律，現在附載在這裏，請豐先生同一般讀者指敎：「悲智空千古，人天一大師，力行菩薩道，直至涅槃時，護敎心何切，孤懷世豈知，再來留勝願，揮淚讀遺詩」。</p>
<h3>憶舊兩章</h3>
<p>— 寧頗</p>
<p>嚴潸光緒三十年，日俄在中國境內大戰，俄敗，戰事終結以後，日本口言撤兵，而軍隊依然遍駐滿洲，並無退意。時趙爾　先生作盛京將軍，僅日首相西圍到瀋視察，趙悉日本軍閥與政治首腦意見不一，又知西園以「斯文一派」而居有權威地位。於是刻意聯歡，並賦詩兩首贈之，上一言末二句；「老爲迂谷懷凄絕，借箸尊前試一籌。」下一首後句：「千章連　將傾日，一簣洪流欲潰時：携手河梁高處望，神州咫尺莫參差。」西園覩詩感動，遂允履行撤兵之約，於是「詩能退敵」，使成請將軍外交佳話。</p>
<p>粤東高明區大年，明亡抱恢復之志，率師與淸兵戰，敗績死亂軍中，未死之先，語家人曰：「吾出師抗敵，不幸馬英裏屍，則葬我於南蓬山之陽，春秋均莫祭祀，免爲異族所知，以平我墓。」戰後家人拾其骸，葬之於山陽。有淸一代，區墓荒凉寂寞，不生寸草。迨辛亥革命，光復舊物以後，墓前青草，遂爾欣欣向榮，後人稱之曰「不服淸」墓。區生前有崖門吊古詩五首，茲錄其一云：「遺恨前朝事，吾來向水濱，乾坤存一脈，社稷有三臣，慷慨勤王志，間關護主身，至今崖畔石，風雨洗胡塵。」以民族英雄詠民族英雄，宜乎詞之激昂慷慨矣。</p>
<h3>蘭心聽琴記</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>廿五日蘭心第三次的市府交饗樂會，我發覺那莫札爾脫小提琴A陽調協奏曲，非常滿意。</p>
<p>這支樂曲的獨奏者是首席小提琴律司金Riskin。他的兩手技術很不錯，左手抖Vibrato，　音Trill都很美滿；換把亦相當準確。右手的弓法非常乾凈，上弓與下弓的頓音尤其出色，上弓絕對是飛行頓音Flying　Stabbato，下弓不知什麽方法，速度很準。像這種弓法，是一股小提琴家所視爲畏途的，而他奏得如此成績，够得上難能可貴的了。唯一的缺點，就是音量太弱。不過富華敎授Foa在擔任指揮，馬思宏出國訪問去了，獨奏人才很不多，律氏的獨奏，實在足以替代他們的。</p>
<p>這協奏曲裏面的Cancenza,是由惠汀勃敎授Wittenberg作的，他是德國的小提琴名家，在歐洲曾經與大名鼎鼎的鋼琴家許那倍而Schnabel合奏過。因爲德國排猶，把他流浪到上海來的。在這裏我眞要爲這位音樂家嘆命運不濟了。</p>
<p>市府樂隊很知道聽衆們喜歡獨秦，所以下期又有杜克森Dukson的大提琴獨奏由，與其他交響由一同供獻，當然是大家很願意知道的。</p>
<h3>如何改善交通</h3>
<p>— 寧愼</p>
<p>當局對交通間題的改善，已煞費苦心，但交通擁擠的情形，並未見得如何改善，現在當局又在着手改善交通了，爰對此問題，貢獻一點小意見茲分述如下：（一）交通警察的指揮，似乎尙守英國人租界時代的遺風；必待縱馬路的車輛走完後，甚至還待遠駛而來之車輛通過後，才啓放横馬路的車輛通過，如是等待的車輛，愈聚愈多，一待啓放，勢必爭先恐後，交通因是更亂，更糟，更難控制；此種情狀，在英國統治下印度的加爾各答，也有同樣情况。所以交通警察的訓練，應該澈底加以改革，指揮交通，應以做捷爲主。</p>
<p>（二）機動車通行較繁的馬路，限制非機動車的通行，似乎可以不必，倘若如此，則必使與此馬路平行的另一條馬路，其車輛之通行，將更趨擁擠，南京路禁止非機動車通行後，九江路的交通，可以爲例。所以機動車通行較繁的馬路可以彷南京辦法，分別劃分機動車與非動車的行駛道。</p>
<h3>介紹「秘密客」</h3>
<p>— 方</p>
<p>在金門大戲院開映的「秘密客」，是蘇聯烏克蘭影片工廠所攝製的波蘭復國運動史。作爲這種復國鬥爭特徵的是地下活動。所以這部影片也以從事秘密活動的地下英雄作爲演出的主綫，展開抗敵復國的艱苦鬥爭史詩。主角蘇聯名演員德莫霍夫斯基在全劇中扮演了七個角色。戲的發展一直是發刺而緊張。</p>
<h3>危記城</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>這人聽到了金城江三字，似乎略略淸醒了一些，也像一頭受驚的野獸似的倉崑四顧，忽然放聲大哭起來。</p>
<p>「啊！金城江，金城江！打長沙出來，一路化了我二十多根條子，才到金城江。可是」，他猛可抬起頭來，頓足大喊：「這些混帳東西！他們半夜裏放起火來，把我的老婆兒子全燒死了，行李也燒光了他們的良心眞黑啊！他們就爲要我的金子，所以放火的！現在，我是家破人亡了，金子還有什麼用？我去扔掉它！我去扔掉它……」</p>
<p>說着，他就一轉身，飛也似的望東狂奔而去，祝兆年想拉住他沒有來得及。</p>
<p>他悵然地呆望着那瘋子的背影，好半響沒有勇氣再走進鎭上去。在這樣的一片廢墟上，再要想找可以搭人的便車豈不等於做夢，可是他瞧那邊鐵路綫上似乎還有兩三個機頭和十幾節貨革在蠕動，因此他又激起了一些希冀；他想這一條又擠又緩爲大家所不敢嘗試的鐵路，今天或評還可以給自己利用一下。</p>
<p>踏着滿地的刦灰，老祝很快的就走到了以前火車站的舊址。——那是比較容易辨認的，因爲地形比絞高，而且多少還有一些瓦礫可尋。也就在這些破散的瓦礫上，像蛆虫似的擠擁着無數劫後餘生的災黎，和上千的衣衫襤褸的傷兵；各種雜物和破爛的衣被散落在人羣的四周，老遠就可以聞到一股刺鼻的臭味。有的人已經病了，就在地上躺着，發出一陣陣刺耳的呻吟</p>
<p>「這不是地獄嗎」？老祝心裏這樣想，脚步開始放緩了。</p>
<p>現在，他還可以看到那些在蠕動的火車上的景象；車頂上，車篷裏，踏步上，全蹲滿了人，那可以不用說，最出乎他意外的是竟有人用木板架在車輛底下的車軸上，而把身子平躺在那裏，幸而車的速度比人的步行還慢，祇要稍微快一些，這些人簡直沒有一個能够活。</p>
<p>而那黑褐色的軌道上，也呈現了一種目所未寓的奇景，各種奇怪的東西全丢在那裏，其中最多的是一堆堆的赤黄色的人糞；已經不像是一條路軌。而做是大都市的垃圾堆了。</p>
<p>實際上，火車也並不眞在往前開，像牛步似的滾了一陣，忽而又浪回來了；站上和車上的職員亂得全像第一天才上班的新手，呌駡和打架倒是不斷的在演出。</p>
<p>祝兆年看着這眼前的稱種怪現象發怔，有一刻鐘光景決不定自己將怎樣做。他心裏覺得非常空虛，一種從來不曾有過的消極的思想突然滲入了他的腦神經來，甚至他想立刻找一處桃花源那樣的地方，單讓自己去躱一下。</p>

<h3>Summons to a Banquet for Kuomintang Councilors: President Chiang Delivers Sincere Instructions, Clarifying the Unwavering Original Intention to Seek Peace</h3>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] Kuomintang President Chiang summoned all Kuomintang councilors to a banquet at the Lishi Society at 7:30 PM on the 27th. Over a hundred people attended. During the banquet, President Chiang first delivered a sincere and tactful speech, emphasizing that the government had never abandoned its desire for peace and would strive to achieve it. Secondly, regarding military matters, he believed that the war situation had made some progress. As for economic issues, there would be a review of the implementation techniques of the emergency economic measures plan. Subsequently, Chen Cheng, who had just returned to Nanjing from Xuzhou, attended and reported on military affairs. The banquet ended around 9 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] During the banquet for Kuomintang councilors on the evening of the 27th, President Chiang delivered a brief speech, stating roughly: The nation has undergone eight years of war and absolutely needs peace. To achieve this goal, the government has been making continuous efforts with a spirit of generosity and tolerance since the victory of the war. However, whether peace can be achieved depends entirely on the attitude of the Communist Party, that is, whether the Communist Party can prioritize the nation and the people and demonstrate its sincerity in seeking peace. On the government's side, if there is a glimmer of hope for peace, it will never change its original intention to seek peace. He hoped that everyone would share this understanding.</p>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] On the eve of the Political Council's discussion of peace proposals, Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan invited ten people, including Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Xu Deheng, He Jihong, Fan Zisui, Jiang Hengyuan, Wang Menglin, and Zhu Yiqing, to discuss and solicit their opinions on the peace issue at around 6 PM on the 27th. It is reported that Liang and the other ten had conducted discussions before meeting with Zhang. Their opinions were reported to Chairman Chiang by Zhang Qun on the night of the 27th and instructions were requested, which were then relayed to Liang and others. They will still attend the plenary review committee on the 28th as usual. Chairman Chiang has also scheduled a luncheon with Liang, Xu, and others on the 28th for further discussions.</p>
<p>Council Sends Telegram to Mao Zedong and Others, Inviting Them to Nanjing to Jointly Plan National Affairs</p>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] The telegram from the Political Council to the Communist Party councilors, inviting them to come to Nanjing to attend the meeting, was first broadcast by the Central Broadcasting Station at 12:00 PM on the 26th. The telegram was drafted by the secretariat based on the temporary emergency motion of one hundred people, including Xiao Yishan, passed by the General Assembly on the 26th. At the same time, a telegram was also sent to Wu Yunfu, the chief Communist Party representative, requesting him to forward it. At 9:30 AM on the 27th, at the twelfth meeting of the Political Council, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen first announced the telegram to the General Assembly and explained that in order to notify the Communist Party as soon as possible, it was first broadcast on the Central Broadcasting Station that evening. At 3:00 PM on the 27th, the Central Broadcasting Station jointly broadcast it again with the National Broadcasting Station. The General Assembly fully agreed with the telegram and its handling. The telegram was officially released by the Political Council, and the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To Mr. Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, Huang Biwu, Zhou Enlai, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao, Chen Shaoyu, and other gentlemen: The General Assembly today believes that peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the country, and the members of this council should make a final effort to resolve the national crisis. It is resolved to send a telegram inviting the Communist Party councilors to come to Nanjing to attend the meeting and jointly plan national affairs. This telegram is hereby sent for your consideration, and please reply with instructions. National Political Council, You (26th).</p>
<h3>Overview of the National Resources Commission's Enterprises</h3>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] When Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission (NRC), reported on the work of the NRC to the Political Council on the morning of the 27th, he pointed out that the purpose of the state-owned industrial and mining enterprises run by the NRC was to gradually build up national capital and establish the economic foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is completely different from the so-called "bureaucratic capital."</p>
<h3>90% of Industrial Equipment in Northeast China Was Dismantled and Removed</h3>
<p>The enterprises operated by the National Resources Commission can be divided into ten categories: electricity, coal, petroleum, steel, other metals (including tungsten, antimony, tin, etc.), machinery, chemicals, cement, and sugar. The following is a description of five categories:</p>
<p>(1) Electricity: A. Northeast: The degree of electricity development in the Northeast region by the Japanese was very high. The total power generation of its hydroelectric and thermal power plants was over 2 million kilowatts. However, after the Soviet army entered, most of it was dismantled and removed. Subsequently, the Communist army followed and entered, and the loss of power equipment was extremely heavy. Currently, only Xiaofengman has 140,000 kilowatts, Fushun has 30,000 kilowatts, and others have 30,000 kilowatts, totaling 200,000 kilowatts. Ninety percent has been lost, which is truly regrettable! B. North China: The power centers of North China are Tianjin, Beiping, and Tangshan. The Japanese built long-distance power lines to connect them. According to the original Japanese plan, North China could have 120,000 kilowatts of electricity. However, by the end of the war, only 60,000 kilowatts had been completed. After our reorganization, it has been increased to 90,000 kilowatts. Unfortunately, due to the poor original equipment and the diverse sources of machinery, everything is not ideal. The situation may improve after the American equipment arrives. C. Taiwan: The original power capacity was 320,000 kilowatts. However, the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant was destroyed by bombing during the Pacific War. When we took over, only 40,000 kilowatts remained. After reorganization, there are now 180,000 kilowatts, which is sufficient for the entire province. The total power capacity of the country is about 900,000 kilowatts, of which about 570,000 kilowatts belong to the National Resources Commission, accounting for more than 63% of the total. Given the size of China, this amount of electricity is definitely not enough. The United States has 50 million kilowatts of electricity nationwide, and England also has 14 million kilowatts. We must continue to work hard in the future. It should be mentioned that the Three Gorges water conservancy project on the Yangtze River can supply more than 10 million kilowatts of electricity after completion, and the price is also very low. Unfortunately, this project requires 3-4 billion US dollars, which is not allowed under the current financial situation. We have to reluctantly suspend it and use the remaining resources to build other small-scale power plants.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Captures Coal Mine, All Equipment Destroyed</h3>
<p>(2) Coal Mines: A. Northeast: The major coal mines taken over by the National Resources Commission include Fushun, Benxi, Xi'an, Beipiao, and Fuxin. However, due to military reasons, these five mines could not be continued, or due to poor equipment, accidents occurred from time to time, and production was sharply reduced. It is already difficult for each mine to produce 5,000-6,000 tons per day. B. Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi: The coal quality of this mine is excellent and is the only large mine in the north. Its quality is higher than that of the Kailuan Coal Mine. We were planning to reorganize it after taking over. The mine has been captured by the Communist Party. Although it was later recovered, most of the machinery was dismantled and important parts were destroyed. It is now mined using indigenous methods, producing only a few hundred tons per day. C. Ji-Lu Area: The Zhongxing Coal Mine in Shandong and other mines in Hebei were mostly destroyed by the Communist army.</p>
<p>(3) Petroleum: We extracted oil in Gansu during the war. In the past, we could produce about 4 million gallons per year. However, because the wells were too close to each other when drilling, it has now dropped to 200,000 gallons per year. It is expected to increase to 300,000 gallons this month, and it can continue to increase next month. The total amount for the year should not be less than last year. In addition, in the Northeast, before the end of the war, the Japanese considered setting up a synthetic oil refinery in the Northeast. After we took over, we do not plan to do so for the time being. In addition, the crude oil refinery is currently being repaired and is expected to produce oil in the second half of the year. In Taiwan, the oil refinery built by the Japanese in Kaohsiung was not completed and the war stopped. We are now building it in three phases and expect to complete it before the end of this year. The crude oil purchased from foreign countries is shipped in three batches of 6,000 tons each. It is expected to arrive before the end of this month. In total, our current gasoline production is only enough for the country for two months a year, and continued efforts are needed.</p>
<p>In total, the estimated output of the petroleum industry this year is 12 million gallons of crude oil, 18 million gallons of gasoline, 15 million gallons of kerosene, 16 million gallons of diesel, 33 million gallons of heavy oil and fuel oil, and 180,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Gasoline production is about 20% of the country's needs.</p>
<p>(4) Steel: A. Northeast: The two major plants in Benxi and Anshan were dismantled by the Soviet army and destroyed by the Communist army, leaving them in ruins. Anshan currently produces only 60 tons per day, but it can be greatly increased next year. It is hoped that a large part of the steelmaking machines can be obtained from Japanese reparations, so that our country can also manufacture its own steel rails in the future. B. Shijingshan and Tangshan in North China also have considerable output. The current difficulty is the lack of machinery. If we want to establish a new foundation, we should seek help from reparations. In terms of output, the products of the National Resources Commission's plants account for 100% of the country's total.</p>
<p>(5) Cement: Before the war, the total cement production in the country was about 1 million tons. After the victory, we took over two factories in the Northeast, Benxi and others. The production of the Benxi Cement Plant is limited due to electricity supply problems, and the machinery of the other plant was dismantled. The two plants are expected to produce 50,000 tons of cement this year. The two plants in North China are expected to produce 140,000 tons this year. The three plants in Taiwan can produce 150,000 tons this year and are expected to increase to 400,000 tons next year. The total cement production in the country is 700,000 tons, and the National Resources Commission produces more than 300,000 tons, accounting for about 45% of the total.</p>
<p>Weng then briefly reported on the general situation of the enterprises operated by the National Resources Commission. It is said that the organizational structure of the National Resources Commission's enterprises can be divided into two categories: (1) enterprises solely invested or jointly invested with other government agencies, the organizational methods of which are divided into limited liability companies and factories/mines; (2) enterprises with private shareholders participating, which all adopt the joint-stock company method in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. There are a total of 70 units in the first category of enterprises. As of the end of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the book value of their fixed assets was approximately 849 billion yuan. There are a total of 23 units in the second category of enterprises, and the value of fixed assets is more than 190 billion yuan. If calculated at market prices, their value is more than this.</p>
<p>The National Resources Commission pays attention to specialized technical skills in the selection of staff. There are a total of 32,000 staff members and 220,000 workers, totaling 250,000 people. The salaries of staff members do not exceed 30% of the salaries of civil servants. The prices of the National Resources Commission's products are all lower than market prices. Some enterprises, such as electricity, coal, and petroleum, are subject to government price restrictions. Other steel, sugar, etc. are subject to considerable restrictions by the National Resources Commission. For example, the market price of pig iron in Shanghai is about 3 million yuan per ton, while the National Resources Commission only sells it for more than 1.8 million yuan. The market price of steel products is more than 7 million yuan, while the National Resources Commission only sells it for 3.5 to 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Surplus Funds All Submitted to the National Treasury</h3>
<p>In terms of the overall business performance of the National Resources Commission's enterprises, the total operating income last year was 267.7 billion yuan, the expenditure was 239 billion yuan, and the surplus was 28.5 billion yuan, which has been submitted to the national treasury. It is hoped that this year's surplus can reach 50 billion yuan. The National Resources Commission pays all statutory taxes on the enterprises it operates.</p>
<p>Weng then analyzed the fundamental policy of the National Resources Commission. It is said that the National Resources Commission focuses on operating and constructing large-scale basic industrial and mining enterprises, and does not hope to take on too many factories that were urgently needed during the Anti-Japanese War and those taken over after the war. It is not necessary for the government to continue to operate these, and they will be transferred to private or local governments. A total of 26 units have already been transferred, including alcohol chemical plants and power plants. Sixteen units are ready to be sold, five of which are paper mills that can produce 100 tons of paper per day.</p>
<p>Finally, Weng said that the future work of the National Resources Commission will be on the one hand to repair the disabled and gradually put them into operation, and on the other hand to consider the need to establish new enterprises. Of course, there are various difficulties in carrying out this type of work. The economic situation across the country is unstable, income and expenditure cannot be balanced, and those who handle affairs cannot feel at ease, which is just one aspect. However, since they have taken on this responsibility, they are obliged to do their best to achieve success.</p>
<h3>List of Political Council Review Committees Determined, Review Work Begins Today, Administrative Reports All Completed Last Night</h3>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] The reporting stage of the current session of the Political Council was fully completed on the evening of the 27th, and it was decided to start the review work from the 28th. The administrative reports heard by the General Assembly began on the 21st and lasted for seven days, with thirteen meetings. In addition to the Land Administration and Health Departments reporting to the Review Committee, there were fifteen reports, including political reports, which, together with the written reports of the five Yuan, were sent to the respective Review Committees for review. The list of members of each Review Committee was proposed by the Presidium and passed at the thirteenth meeting on the afternoon of the 27th. The first Review Committee is composed of councilors Du Gou Ruo and others, and the conveners are Wang Zemin, Chen Shaoxian, and Liu Xing. The second Review Committee is composed of councilors Zhou Shengzhen and others, and the conveners are Zhou Jue, Zhou Qianchong, and Chen Bosheng. The third committee is composed of councilors Huang Su Fang and others, and the conveners are Xu Xiaoyan, Huang Yuren, and Fang Shaoyun. The fourth committee is composed of councilors Pan Lianru and others, and the conveners are Deng Feihuang, Wan Hongtu, and Chen Baoyin. The fifth committee is composed of councilors Jiang Su Gang and others, and the conveners are Xiao Yishan, Huang Yanpei, and Xu Shaodi. In addition, there are two special review committees. The first committee is composed of Ma Canli and others, and the conveners are Zhang Zhenlu, Zou Shuwen, and Gan Jiaxin. The second special seasonal committee is composed of Guang Sheng and others, and the conveners are Yan Shutang, Jiang Yiping, and Duanmu Kai. On the morning of the 28th, a joint plenary review meeting will be held first to review various proposals related to peace talks.</p>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] The twelfth meeting of the Political Council was held at 9:30 AM on the 27th. Chairman Zhang Boling and Deputy Secretary Lei reported that as of last night, a total of 301 councilors had registered, and 209 people attended today. It was reported that the telegram from the General Assembly to the Communist Party councilors to attend the meeting in Nanjing had been broadcast. After the report, the Work Report of Chairman Weng Wenhao of the National Resources Commission was heard. Weng added a detailed analysis on the work situation, business overview, and work policy. Afterwards, the councilors raised about 30 written and oral inquiries, mostly focusing on the work of the National Resources Commission in the Northeast and the future construction plans in the Northwest and Southwest. Weng selected the main points to answer. The meeting ended at about 12:15 PM. The general situation of this morning's meeting was good, and there were not many inquiries from the councilors. The atmosphere was particularly calm. The thirteenth General Assembly was held at 3:30 PM, with 219 councilors attending. Chairman Wu Yifang first listened to the work report of Director Huo Baoshu of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), followed by the councilors raising 33 written and oral inquiries, which Huo briefly answered. After a ten-minute break at about 6 PM, Chen Qitian, the new Minister of Economic Affairs, continued to report, and the meeting adjourned at about 7 PM.</p>
<h3>Political Council Snippets</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yu Zhenyi</p>
<p>When Weng Wenhao reported on the work of the National Resources Commission, his Zhejiang Lanqing Mandarin, coupled with a barrage of place names and numbers, was very difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The machinery and equipment left to us by Japan was not small in number, but those in the Northeast were first moved away by the Soviet Union, who were "fighting for a few days," and then many were destroyed due to the war. Weng repeatedly said "Unfortunately" more than once when reporting such facts.</p>
<p>The councilors addressed Weng differently in their written and oral inquiries. Some called him Minister Weng, some called him Chairman Weng, and some called him Mr. Weng. Some councilors asked the National Resources Commission about the affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>One councilor asked why the government did not find a way to mine gold in several western provinces, where gold is everywhere, in order to curb inflation. Chen Baoyin said that Xikang, Jilin, and other places have atomic energy elements, which should be mined to meet the needs of the new era.</p>
<p>Chen Yaodong asked: "The Capital Power Plant usually cuts off power by district, but on the day the Political Council meets, it is brightly lit. How coincidental!" He advocated that bureaucratic capital across the country should be investigated, and the investigation work should start from Nanjing, especially from the Capital Power Plant.</p>
<p>The situation of work in the Northeast was the main focus of inquiries. Gu Gengye said that some staff members sat in cars, running around the streets, eating, drinking, and dancing, neglecting their proper duties, eating "big fish and meat every day, with lavish food and wine," and still saying "eating coarse tea and simple meals every day, working hard." It's really letting the country down.</p>
<p>Weng's answers were quite witty. He said to some things: "As far as I know, it's not that serious." He promised to "check" on the outrageous affairs of the Northeast personnel, and pushed away all the matters of China Textile Industries Corporation and other things that were not under the jurisdiction of the National Resources Commission.</p>
<p>The UNRRA work report was trivial and disorganized, full of dull numbers, and some councilors were snoring in their seats. The facetious said that what the Political Council meeting needed was "stimulants and relief supplies," not "sleeping pills."</p>
<p>The councilors gave UNRRA several strange names in their written and oral inquiries. Some called it "Relief Headquarters," some called it "Distribution Agency" or "Friction Agency."</p>
<p>Many councilors pointed out that UNRRA uses milk, canned food, and rags to pick up the old and poor, which cannot cure hunger and cannot keep out the cold. It is truly a waste without benefit."</p>
<p>Yu Nanqiu appealed for the people of Hunan, saying that the local famine victims use tree bark as the best poor grain. Yu Ruzhou, a councilor from the Northeast, also "brought tears to the meeting," hoping to provide more relief.</p>
<p>He Jihong said that some people blamed Jiang Tingfu for not being able to do business, but UNRRA is now selling materials under the leadership of Director Huo and exchanging them for cotton to resell to China Textile Industries Corporation, which is completely a business eye.</p>
<p>A series of inquiries suddenly turned the extremely silent atmosphere of the meeting lively. Yan Shutang sang "Three Hates for Director Huo" on the stage, (1) hating him for unfair distribution, (2) hating him for not knowing the priorities, and (3) hating him for not being thick-skinned enough, winning a lot of laughter and applause.</p>
<p>Wu Wangji gave a grand speech in Zhejiang Mandarin. He said that the office staff of an UNRRA branch is as many as several thousand, more than the staff of the provincial government. The organization is huge and wastes money.</p>
<p>The UNRRA inquiry was completed at 6 o'clock, and there was still a report from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Everyone was extremely anxious, but under the capable handling of Chairman Wu Yifang, the agenda progressed smoothly with verbal and bell prompts. The entire work was completed within an hour, and the title of "the most capable chairman of the Political Council" is well-deserved.</p>
<p>Chen Qitian, the new Minister of Economic Affairs, gave a report that can be called simple and clear. In just 18 minutes, he explained his attitude and the future policy. It was indeed the shortest of the reports of the officials in this conference.</p>
<p>One councilor hoped in a written inquiry that Chen would "break the bureaucratic style and give the people a fresh start." There were only eight written and oral inquiries today, the fewest inquiries of any ministry, which proves that the councilors are generally polite to the new minister.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Business Report</h3>
<p>Director Huo Baoshu of UNRRA attended the Political Council on the afternoon of the 27th to give a brief explanation of UNRRA's extensive operations. Huo pointed out that the total fund of UNRRA is only 2 billion US dollars. Although the supplies finally decided to be allocated to China have accounted for one-third of the total fund of UNRRA, they are still not enough to be distributed to various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>All business activities of UNRRA must be based on the basic agreement signed between the Chinese government and UNRRA. The treaty stipulates that China has the obligation to faithfully fulfill the resolutions of the UNRRA General Assembly. UNRRA has the right to consult and supervise the handling of supplies transported to China. Therefore, UNRRA consults with UNRRA on the handling of each event. The distribution, transportation, sale, and use of supplies are all handled through consultation by various committees organized by the UNRRA Joint Headquarters.</p>
<p>The total tonnage of supplies supplied by UNRRA to China is approximately 2.7 million tons, of which relief supplies account for approximately 45% and rehabilitation supplies account for approximately 55%. Various supplies are shipped in batches, and it is increasingly felt that they are not enough for distribution.</p>
<p>After the supplies arrive, some are used for relief and some are used for rehabilitation. Those used for relief are emergency relief, work relief, sending refugees back to their hometowns, and social welfare. As of the end of April this year, 1.4 million people have been sent back to their hometowns. 280,000 tons of food and more than 20,000 tons of clothing have been distributed for emergency relief work. The work relief projects give priority to water conservancy, followed by road repair, and then small-scale textile and health projects. There are more than 120 water conservancy projects, large ones such as the Yellow River, seadikes, the Yangtze River, embankments, and the Pearl River water conservancy, most of which have been completed. The benefited farmland is approximately 60 million mu, and the benefited farmers reach 30 million people. As for social welfare undertakings, more than 3,000 units have been organized, either directly by UNRRA, jointly by UNRRA and social organizations, or completely entrusted to social organizations. A total of 150,000 tons of food has been allocated, benefiting 5.5 million people. Regarding the use of medical equipment, UNRRA has subsidized more than 1,600 health agencies and public and private hospitals, and allocated more than 15,000 units of hospital bed equipment.</p>
<p>The rehabilitation supplies include transportation equipment and industrial, mining, and fishing equipment. UNRRA has transported 200,000 tons of transportation equipment. The world is currently short of transportation equipment, and it is not easy for UNRRA to obtain it. The rapid recovery of transportation on the Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Hankou railways is due to the supply of UNRRA equipment. Industrial and mining equipment includes electrical machinery, power plant, and coal mining equipment. There are many types of agricultural and fishing equipment, and the more notable ones are more than 100 new-style fishing vessels and more than 1,000 plowing machines.</p>
<p>Finally, Huo mentioned the relief in the Communist area, the restoration of the Yellow River flood area, and the funding problems of UNRRA. He said, "Last year, the disasters in Hunan and Guangxi provinces were serious, and work relief projects in various places also needed food. Most of the food was used to rescue disaster areas and carry out work relief. Not only did the Communist area not get much, but the northern provinces also got less. In February and March of this year, more than 20,000 tons of supplies were rushed to the Communist area, which was more than what other areas received during the same period.</p>
<p>The soil in the Yellow River flood area will become a desert, and the restoration work is urgent. The highest authorities and local people are enthusiastic about advocating the restoration of the flood area. The UNRRA Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu branches have been concentrating their efforts on handling the work in the flood area since April 1. Although UNRRA's funding accounts for a considerable proportion in the national budget, it is still not enough to support the many operations. In order to help us complete the scheduled plan, UNRRA has approved the conversion of supplies that cannot be delivered after May 31 to cotton to be transported to China and sold to supplement UNRRA's funding shortage.</p>
<p>Huo's report prompted the councilors to raise 12 oral inquiries, all of which were answered satisfactorily.</p>
<p>[Reported by our Nanjing Office on the 27th] Director Huo of UNRRA was heavily attacked by various parties during his report to the Political Council on the 27th, especially the councilors from the Northeast. The councilors from other North China provinces also raised serious questions about UNRRA's failure to transport enough food to the disaster areas. Northeast councilors Han Chunxuan and Yu Ruzhou loudly appealed, hoping on the one hand to improve the various malpractices of the UNRRA Northeast Office, and on the other hand to transport a large amount of supplies to provide relief. He Jihong, Sun Shengwu, and others appealed for the disaster victims in North China, hoping to allocate grain as soon as possible to provide relief. Disaster relief is as urgent as fighting a fire and cannot be delayed any longer. In addition, some councilors also asked for help for Shandong, and their speeches were extremely sorrowful. Yan Shutang and Wu Wangji and others criticized UNRRA's organization and efficiency, believing that UNRRA's distribution was unfair, did not know the priorities, and wasted money. Huo replied that UNRRA was prepared to distribute more food to the north. However, it can be said that of the 1.9 million tons of supplies transported to China by UNRRA, 1.1 million tons were grain. There is not much left now. There are tens of thousands of tons of rice planned to be distributed to the southern provinces. In addition, there are tens of thousands of tons of noodles planned to be used to provide relief to Lu and Yu. Currently, UNRRA has not yet passed the danger period. It is hoped that the central government, local governments, and public and private organizations can cooperate. It is hoped that the councilors can appeal to foreign countries. UNRRA has made a request, but it is difficult to say whether it is promising.</p>
<h3>Wu Shangying Arrives in San Francisco; Will Continue Visit to Washington and Ottawa</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 27th - Radio broadcast: Wu Shangying, the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan and leader of the Chinese delegation tasked with harmonizing relations between China, the United States, and Canada, arrived here today from Japan. Mr. Wu stated in a speech that his primary mission is to clarify the status of foreigners in China since the abolition of extraterritoriality in 1943. Regarding the anti-American demonstrations that occurred in various parts of China a few months ago, he stated, "This kind of emotional impulse does not originate from the people's true feelings, but is agitated by a few individuals with ulterior motives engaging in reckless propaganda." The delegation will continue its visit to Washington and Ottawa.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao's Response to Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 27th Dispatch] The councilors of the参政会 (National Political Council) concentrated their written and oral questions, which were presented to Weng Wenhao in the morning of the 27th, on two major issues: (1) the working situation of the 资源委员会 (Resources Commission) in Northeast China and other regions, and (2) how to continue the development of industrial construction in Southwest and Northwest China and other regions.</p>
<p>The councilor from Northeast China, Cui Chuiyan, and others, pointed out painfully that the performance of the 资源委员会 (Resources Commission) in Northeast China was quite unsatisfactory. Someone once said that if the Northeast were managed by the Japanese, it could recover to the state it was in on August 13th in three years, but if it were managed by the Chinese, it would revert to the state it was in on September 18th in three years, which is heartbreaking to say! Currently, the 资源委员会 (Resources Commission) only takes over complete factories, but ignores the incomplete ones. It is hoped that the authorities will not simply follow past practices, for that would be fortunate for the nation!</p>
<p>Pan Lianru raised an inquiry about the issue of principles, asking why the report did not mention regional allocation, and also inquired about what plans there were for dispersing factories in this atomic age. Another councilor also asked whether the government was planning to mine uranium to meet the needs of the times. Mr. Weng responded to each question one by one.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 27th Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to Shanghai to secretly investigate the illegal profit-making activities of Zhongfu and Yangzi companies, and the results have been obtained. This case was once questioned by councilors to Minister of Finance Yu, who stated, "This case is being handled under the orders of Chairman Chiang, and the investigation results will be reported to Chairman Chiang." These companies and others violated import and export control regulations in Shanghai, privately transporting foreign goods and making huge profits. It is now learned that the personnel sent by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to Shanghai for secret investigation have returned to Nanjing, and have jointly completed a lengthy report of over a hundred pages, which has been submitted to Chairman Chiang for review.</p>
<h3>Guan Linzheng Arrives in Nanjing; Guo Chan and Huang Zhenqiu Switch Positions</h3>

<h3>Mo Dehui Arrives in Shanghai; Feels Unwell Due to Storms En Route</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Mo Dehui, a member of the National Government Committee, returned to Shanghai from Taiwan on the Zhongxing ship at 7:30 p.m. on the 26th. Due to physical discomfort, he was admitted to Zhongshan Hospital for recuperation. Mr. Mo told reporters yesterday, "I left Keelung Port on the Zhongxing ship on the morning of the 24th. Less than sixty miles out, we encountered a storm, and the ship's engine malfunctioned. It was repaired for more than ten hours before restarting, and then it stopped twice more due to malfunctions. Just as we encountered a violent storm and waves, the whole ship was in panic. Some passengers asked Mr. Mo to call Chairman Wei to send a ship for rescue. The situation at the time was extremely critical, and there was a life-threatening danger at any moment. Thinking about it now, it feels like another world. I spent three days at sea in the storm, vomiting continuously, and almost fainted several times. Therefore, after arriving at the port last night, I was too exhausted to move. After landing at 9 a.m. on the 27th, I went straight to this hospital for recuperation. My blood pressure is now above 180, and I need to rest for a while before I can go to Nanjing." He also said, "In my personal opinion, Zhang Xueliang's restoration of freedom is not far away, because Mr. Zhang has recently been studying the history of the Ming Dynasty with great concentration, which is extraordinary. Therefore, he has gained the government's understanding, which may reduce the term of his confinement." Kong Xiangxi also went to visit Mr. Mo around 7 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>The Reformist Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Declaration and a Letter to Party Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to convene an organization committee today. A certain key member pointed out that the number of attendees is sufficient to meet the quorum, making it legitimate. However, the reformist faction believes that only the Standing Committee has the power to convene the organization committee, so Zhang Junmai's individual convocation is illegitimate. They have decided not to participate, and said that Wu Xianzi has always regarded convening the organization committee as unnecessary, and will not participate.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the reformist faction of the Democratic Socialist Party issued a declaration of the reform committee and a letter to party members last night, accusing Zhang Junmai of authoritarianism and disrespect for the powers of the Standing Committee. They also said that they will convene a national congress in the short term to re-decide policies and strengthen the organization, and that from now on, they will not recognize any decisions made by Zhang Junmai regarding the Democratic Socialist Party.</p>

<h3>National Army Sweeps Along the Chinese Changchun Railway; Communist Army Attacks the Outskirts of Siping Again</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency Taipei 27th Dispatch] Peng Mengji, commander of the Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, and Niu Xianming, chief of staff, answered questions at a press conference on the afternoon of the 26th, stating: (1) During the February 28th Incident, a certain number of rioters were arrested throughout the province. Because the regions have not yet reported all the information, there are no accurate statistics at present. As of the lifting of martial law on the 16th of this month, the headquarters directly handled a total of 585 rioters, of which 68 have been convicted under military law, 291 have been released on bail, 109 have been sent to labor camps for training, and 117 have been handed over to the original sending agencies for investigation and handling and sent to the court for interrogation. There are a total of 30 ringleaders in this riot. As of now, only Guo Guoji has been captured. The remaining 29 are at large and have been listed and sent to the court. It is hoped that they will surrender themselves, otherwise they will be arrested. Those who echoed and blindly followed the people will be exempted from prosecution. (2) According to the investigation by the headquarters and the former Civil Affairs Office of the Public Administration, the numbers of military and civilian casualties and public and private property losses throughout the province during the February 28th Incident are as follows: 16 military officers killed, 135 injured, and 3 missing; 74 soldiers killed, 262 injured, and 37 missing; 64 public educators killed, 1,351 injured, and 8 missing; 244 civilians killed, 383 injured, and 24 missing. All the military personnel were from outside the province. Among the deaths, injuries, and missing persons of public educators and civilians, 1,431 were from outside the province and 643 were from Taiwan Province. The total loss of private property throughout the province was 441,373,280 yuan, including 391,147,836 yuan in losses to people from outside the province and 50,225,444 yuan in losses to people from Taiwan Province. The loss of public property was 175,097,331 yuan. (3) Most of the firearms and weapons lost by military agencies and troops throughout the province during the February 28th Incident have also been recovered. (4) The Heping Daily newspaper, which was sealed during martial law, has been unsealed. The Minbao, Renmin Daobao, Zhongwai Daily, and Daming Daily have also been allowed to reorganize and dispose of their assets. However, the latter four newspapers will still have to follow the application and registration procedures and submit them to the competent authority for approval when they are published in the future. (5) According to the central government's order, because Taiwan Province is an isolated overseas county, the commander of the Taiwan Provincial Garrison is under the close command of the chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government. Within the scope of security and garrison, the Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters has command authority over the central military agencies and troops stationed in Taiwan.</p>

<h3>US Army Officer Steals Gold Bars in Taiwan; FBI Detains and Interrogates</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 27th] Former Lieutenant Colonel Evans, while serving as a US military civil affairs officer in Taiwan, stole gold coins and bars worth US$100,000. He has been detained by the FBI and will be prosecuted for theft. According to investigators from the bureau, in October 1945, Evans accompanied the advance contingent of the Chinese army to Taiwan to take over the government. As a US civil affairs officer, he was entrusted with the custody of eight boxes of gold bars received from the Japanese. However, he only returned four boxes to the Chinese authorities. He exchanged the remaining four boxes for over US$100,000 in Shanghai. He returned to the United States last year and brought this money back with him, and was discharged from military service on April 14th of last year. Ninety-seven percent of the gold bars he sold have been found in Shanghai, but the FBI has so far been unable to find where he hid the US$100,000 he brought back. US Attorney Carter stated that Evans is currently detained in the Santa Barbara jail. Several Chinese and Japanese witnesses have arrived here and will testify in court. The case will be submitted to the grand jury for questioning on the 28th.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>I read the news item "The Situation in Northern Jiangsu is Gradually Stabilizing" on the first page of your newspaper on May 20th, which stated, "The remnants of the Communists near Dongtai and Caoyan have been repelled by the National Army earlier this week, and Dazhongji has also returned to the control of the National Army." After the fall of Dazhongji, hundreds of people and public officials were killed or humiliated, and no less than several thousand were displaced without food or clothing. The Communist troops either gathered or dispersed, and as of today, have not moved an inch away from Dazhongji. How could it have been returned to the control of the National Army? The displaced refugees have nowhere to go. We only hope for the National Army to thoroughly suppress the bandits. I submit this situation with sincerity and ask that it be published in the corrections column. I offer my most fervent prayers. Represented by Zhu Yao, representative of over 1,570 displaced refugees in the Ninth District of Dongtai County. May 22nd.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: At the same time as this letter, we also received a letter from Wu Zhicheng, the mayor of Dazhongji, with content similar to the above letter, so it is omitted).</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun's Financial Report (Continued from the Previous Day)</h3>
<p>(4) Stabilizing Finance</p>
<p>Stabilizing finance is the most important measure at present. Based on the implementation over the past year, the following can be reported:</p>
<p>(1) Managing Foreign Exchange: During the recovery period, in order to encourage the import of goods and stabilize economic life, the foreign exchange market was opened in March 1946, and the Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange were implemented, setting the exchange rate for the US dollar at 2020. Since then, various essential goods that had been lacking domestically have been adequately replenished, but due to the low exchange rate, the import of other non-essential goods has also been encouraged, and some foreign goods have competed with domestic products. On the other hand, exports and remittances from overseas Chinese have shrunk due to the unfavorable exchange rate. Therefore, on August 19th of the same year, the exchange rate for the US dollar was adjusted to 3350 in an attempt to improve the situation. However, after several months, because the domestic economic situation had not stabilized and export trade still needed to be further promoted, when the government announced the Emergency Economic Measures Program in February of the following year, the exchange rate for the US dollar was changed to 12,000 in order to restore the normal state of the economy and rescue the domestic industry and commerce. All these measures were suitable adjustments to adapt to the environment at the time, in comparison to the domestic and foreign purchasing power of currency.</p>
<p>(2) Using Gold: After the victory, the effects of using gold can be described as follows: 1. From March of last year to February of this year, in the one year period, the amount of legal tender returned to circulation due to the Central Bank selling gold was approximately 1 trillion yuan; 2. Whenever prices were about to fluctuate, the Central Bank would release a large amount of gold to absorb the rising prices of legal tender and commodities, thereby alleviating the situation. Overall, in the one year period, because purchasing power was transferred to gold, the phenomenon of hoarding and speculation was relatively reduced; 3. Last year, the black market exchange rate fluctuated with commodity prices, which greatly affected the credit of the currency. Fortunately, the price of gold rarely changed. Because of this, the black market exchange rate did not fluctuate violently. However, while gold policy can be effective for a time, it is not a fundamental solution. To stabilize the economy, especially since the end of last year, speculative capital from all over the country has flocked to Shanghai, and gold has become the target of speculation. If the Central Bank does not sell a large amount of gold, the price of gold will rise daily, stimulating commodity prices. If it intends to fight speculators with all its strength, the sacrifice will be great, and it will only increase the profits of those who seek profit. Therefore, the government's use of gold policy had to change direction. After the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures Program, the buying and selling of gold was prohibited, and black market transactions were strictly prohibited, in order to isolate the price of gold from commodity prices and reduce the factors of commodity price fluctuations. It seems that these are all measures that are suitable for the times.</p>
<p>(3) Controlling Interest Rates: The Ministry has always handled interest rate policies in accordance with the following principles: 1. The National Bank will provide low-interest loans to finance agricultural, industrial, and mining production, but strictly verify their use to prevent fraudulent arbitrage; 2. The general deposit and loan interest rates of banks will be negotiated by the local banking associations, taking into account the actual market situation, and reported to the local Central Bank for approval and announcement. Although times have changed, the above principles still seem applicable today. However, in a state where commodity prices and interest rates are mutually cause and effect, it is impossible to expect any one-sided method to be effective in either suppressing commodity prices or suppressing interest rates. Moreover, controlling bank interest rates is one thing, and controlling high-interest loans in general society is another. Banks are legal organizations, making them easier to control, while lending in general society has no fixed form or method, making management extremely difficult. However, if the latter is ignored and only banks are the object of control, the result will be twofold: 1. Forcing speculative capital to leave legitimate financial institutions and flock to the black market; 2. Forcing banks to secretly collect deposits at high interest rates, operate illegally, and create false accounts. Therefore, over the past year, in order to cooperate fully and achieve practical results, effective measures have been taken on both the passive and active sides. On the passive side, there are measures such as approving interest rate methods, strictly cracking down on illegal financial institutions, and investigating and prohibiting speculative trading. On the active side, there are measures such as guiding speculative capital to flow into legitimate financial institutions, reasonably supplying funds to legitimate industry and commerce, and expanding treasury bond sales, with the aim of relieving agricultural and industrial production from the oppression of high interest rates.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Striving for the Direction of Peace</h3>
<p>The National Political Council passed the temporary emergency motion proposed by Councilors Xiao Yishan and 99 others on the 26th, requesting the Council to quickly hold a plenary review meeting to discuss peace proposals and requesting the Congress to telegraph Communist Councilors in Beijing to attend the meeting and discuss national affairs together to resolve the national crisis. This telegram inviting the Communists to resume peace talks has been sent by the Secretariat of the National Political Council, and the Council will begin reviewing the peace proposals proposed by the Councilors starting today. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, there are as many as eighteen peace proposals to be submitted to the plenary review committee for discussion. Not only is it clear evidence that "peace is the unanimous desire of the people," but the enthusiasm of the Councilors in calling for peace can also be seen. The main task of this National Political Council is to appeal to both the government and the Communists for peace and to jointly agree on a practical and effective peace proposal so that peace talks can resume immediately to break the current political deadlock. Therefore, the whole country has great expectations for the convening of this National Political Council; we sincerely hope that this National Political Council can truly bring peace to the people.</p>
<p>In the current environment, although the people want peace and stability, and even long for peace as much as a severe drought longs for rain clouds, the possibility of resuming peace talks still seems very slim. As far as the government is concerned, in order to relieve the suffering of the people and save the national crisis, it naturally hopes that the country can immediately turn hostility into friendship. Perhaps its desire for peaceful reunification is more urgent than anyone else, as Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng said: "The National Political Council is a civil institution, and it is natural for the Councilors to propose peace requests. The government also sincerely hopes for peace." Therefore, whether peace talks can resume depends entirely on the Communists' thoughts, and the key to whether domestic peace can be realized rests entirely in the hands of the Communists. As for the Communists' attitude? They have ignored the notice of the meeting of the National Political Council, and have not made any indication regarding the appeals of the people of the country. Now that the National Political Council has once again invited Communist Councilors to Beijing to discuss national affairs together, the Shanghai Municipal Council also telegraphed Mao Zedong yesterday, sincerely advising him, but it is not certain whether the Communists can "accept it gladly." The people of the country are now shouting the lament of "unable to live," asking the Communists to have mercy and leave them a ray of hope. How can this wish be realized? The Councilors probably do not have much confidence in this, and the hundred Councilors who proposed the temporary emergency motion also know it very well. In their temporary emergency motion, they also frankly stated: "Although judging from past facts, the future is not optimistic, but knowing that it is impossible to do it, we should do it, and this should be the final direction of the Council's efforts."</p>
<p>The difficulty in achieving domestic peace is as described above, but we still have to continue to work hard in the spirit of "knowing that it is impossible to do it." Because although the current domestic situation is extremely complex, it is also very simple from another perspective. Similarly, although achieving domestic peace is very difficult, it can also be said that it is not difficult. Our nation has always emphasized sincerity, with the so-called "sincerity can move metal and stone." As long as we have the spirit of perseverance, man can conquer nature, and nothing cannot be accomplished. Moreover, our country's politics has always valued the way of benevolence, and those who advocate taking the way of force often fail in politics. If the Communists are obsessed with their own views, blindly insist on being obscured by the prejudices of one party and one person, and cannot prioritize the country and the nation, they will not only lose the essence of being a political party, but will also inevitably be abandoned by their relatives and unable to exist. Therefore, the Communists cannot completely ignore public opinion, whether they are willing to do so in their hearts. As long as the people of the country stand up and speak at this critical moment, express the suffering of their own lives, and at the same time solemnly express their desire for peace and stability, the overall situation may not be irreversible. All institutions representing public opinion, such as the councils of provinces, cities, and counties, should also convene emergency meetings at this time to discuss solutions to achieve domestic peace, represent the people, unanimously demand peace from the Communists, immediately lay down their arms, and reopen peace talks with the government. The Shanghai Municipal Council has already issued a telegram calling for this, and it is hoped that the councils of all provinces, cities, and counties will rise up in response. Finally, they can all convene meetings in the shortest possible time and express their views on peace and stability. At the same time, they will elect representatives, gather in the capital, and join the representatives of the National Political Council to demand peace from the Communists, so that the Communists can understand the direction of public opinion in the country today and have to respect it.</p>
<p>In short, it is time for the people of the country to unite and demand peace from the Communists! We still have a ray of hope for the Communists, believing that the Communist figures, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will not isolate themselves from their compatriots and be regarded as non-human beings. Now is the last opportunity for the Communists to reflect. Time does not wait for us, and it passes quickly. Where to go and what to do, the Communists should make the final choice. We sincerely hope that the National Political Council and the provincial and municipal councils' appeal for peace movement will be successful!</p>
<h3>How to Improve Control Measures</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Chen Qitian, also expressed his intention to improve control measures in his inaugural speech. Although his purpose and methods have not been specifically explained, there is no doubt that its improvement is a matter of public concern, judging from the current control situation.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are currently no systematic control measures; the control measures that we see, apart from foreign exchange, imports, gold, and foreign currency trading, are relatively thorough, while the others are scattered and fragmented, as if they are not very serious. There is neither a comprehensive solution that combines theory and practice, nor a consistent policy. Sometimes it is a storm, and the measures are very strict; sometimes it is intentional or unintentional, ignoring and not asking, as if nothing happened. Here are a few examples, classified as follows, to see a glimpse of the current controls:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding production, in addition to the original state-owned enterprises, such as yarn, cloth, silk, oil, and other industries, a part of the supply is operated by the state; at the same time, the free development of private enterprises is still allowed. On the surface, they are advancing side by side in a posture of free competition, and there is no sign of any control.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding transportation and sales, such as soybeans in the Northeast, sugar in Taiwan, and fuel management, they all have the nature of monopoly or semi-monopoly. However, the scope of control is often limited to the area within its control; it cannot be popularized to the whole area. In other words: wherever it cannot or does not want to control, it is inevitable that it will give up control. For example, sugar in Taiwan is limited to sales to Shanghai, and coal is limited to what can be purchased; whether it is enough to meet the needs beyond the limits, and how to find ways to adjust if the needs are not met, are all ignored, so the word control really seems to be somewhat unworthy of its name.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding distribution, many enemy and puppet materials are directly or entrusted to other agencies to be auctioned or distributed by the government, such as yarn, cloth, medicine, and artificial silk. In addition, daily necessities for people's livelihood should be quantitatively distributed by various material supply agencies according to law, which of course also belongs to the scope of control. The disadvantage is that it is distributed when there is stock, and it is ignored when there is no stock. As a result, the black market is rampant, often controlling the official price; the function of control is completely lost.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding finance, since the establishment of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the government's control over financial business has been gradually strengthened. The Emergency Economic Measures Program has a chapter on strengthening the control of financial business, which imposes very strict restrictions on the deposit and loan interest of financial institutions of officials and businessmen. The crackdown on newly established institutions is particularly strict, but underground money houses are everywhere, almost becoming an open secret. Although state banks have a variety of loans for production, export, and other purposes, it seems that they have made their best efforts; however, industry and commerce still have to seek financing in the black market, so that the market black interest rate often hovers around 20%. Some banks and money houses, without the entrustment of the government, arbitrarily engage in the purchase and sale of goods, and even engage in speculative trading; these also exist in many places. As for the escape of funds, the flooding of overseas remittances, and the mischief of official capital, they are especially blatant and have no scruples. It can be seen that the control of financial business has not had much practical effect.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding commodity prices, the means adopted in this regard are price limits, price negotiations, distribution, subsidies, and strict prohibition of price increases, manipulation, hoarding, and speculation. The relevant agencies in various places have tried every means to carry out these policies without being able to implement them fully; however, the rising wind is becoming more intense, the black market is becoming more rampant, and almost all price stabilization methods have become mere formalities. The so-called commodity price control has long been at the end of its strength.</p>
<p>Originally, the economy is based on circulation as a principle, and all man-made restrictions are difficult to be effective. Countries such as Britain and the United States, whose laws are said to be strict and whose handling is particularly serious, still find it difficult to eliminate the black market. Moreover, our country's control, in the horizontal direction, is mostly limited to one area; it is not possible to do everything at the same time, and in the vertical direction, it is inevitably influenced by various relationships to take convenient and temporary measures, and it is not possible to completely plan from beginning to end. In terms of the technical aspects of implementing restrictions, it is also inevitable that they are too subjective, unwilling to put themselves in the position of those with vested interests, and leave a step back for them, so that the general good merchants are forced to obey the law, and sincere cooperation is not possible. Under these circumstances, even if there are honest and upright cadres who follow the rules and short-sightedly and earnestly promote it, they may not be able to fully achieve the expected results. The competent authorities, and also knowing that it is a very complicated and laborious work, and also only make small calculations, or mix in other side effects, hoping to completely achieve the effectiveness of this control with the official language of this order, then the number of successes and failures need not be seen after the fact. If Minister Chen of Economic Affairs really wants to improve control measures, the above-mentioned facts should not be ignored.</p>

<h3>Attlee Delivers Speech Defending Bevin's Foreign Policy; Britain Considers Changing Policy Towards Europe</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, Broadcast on the 27th: British Prime Minister Attlee delivered an important speech at the Labour Party Congress today, denouncing all the slanderous attacks by opponents. It is said: "Bevin's foreign policy is neither following the United States nor anti-Soviet. Democratic socialism is the path to peace, prosperity, freedom, and happiness. Britain is now showing this to the world. Britain will never be inferior to others, and what it seeks is cooperation with all countries. We express our great confidence in Bevin and his work."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Margate, England, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech at the Labour Party Congress this morning, supporting Foreign Secretary Bevin's policies and refuting "the accusation by those who rely on a certain foreign country that we rely on a certain foreign country." Attlee expressed confidence in the work of the entire government. In terms of foreign policy, he emphasized the importance of economic negotiations, referring to Britain's economic agreements with Poland and Hungary. Attlee accused the Conservative opposition of lacking any general plan to compete with the Labour Party. At the same time, the Congress elected members of the Executive Committee this morning, and they are the same as those elected in the previous session, including Health Minister Bevan, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, and Lord President of the Council Morrison.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain is now considering changing its policy towards Western Europe in order to improve relations with the governments of countries controlled by the Communist Party. For example, based on this new policy, Britain has recently recognized the governments of Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania, and is trying to improve relations with Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. At the same time, Britain will also assume its new mission in Eastern Europe to enhance the status of social democratic parties in those countries. The signs of Britain's policy change can be seen from the following points: (1) The government has decided to send the former leader of the Labour Party, Noel-Baker, to lead a goodwill delegation to visit Yugoslavia; (2) The government has also decided to send Labour Party Secretary-General Philipp to Romania in June to contact the country's social democratic party; (3) The government has invited Bulgaria to send a diplomatic delegation to Britain; (4) Britain has agreed in principle to conclude a commercial treaty with Poland and has decided to renew the British-Polish economic agreement. In addition, the decision of Britain and the Soviet Union to conduct commercial negotiations is even more significant. On the diplomatic front, Britain has also proposed to amend the Anglo-Soviet Twenty-Year Military Alliance Treaty. According to Foreign Office officials, the new draft treaty proposes to extend the alliance to fifty years. Based on past experience, if Britain and the Soviet Union improve relations, it will naturally promote friendship with Eastern European countries.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Congress Approves Conscription Act in Peacetime; Shows Anti-Bevin Forces Weakened</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Margate, 26th] The British Labour Party Congress today approved the government's conscription policy by a vote of four to one. The debate on conscription was quite heated, as pre-war pacifism still holds potential power within the Labour Party. A motion was put forward opposing the loss of freedom for party members under the Conscription Act, specifically pointing out that those conscripted under the Act's final period would not be free from military responsibility until 1961, a full sixteen years after the end of the war.  Woolley also supported the motion, stating that Britain had formed a military alliance with the United States and that the implementation of the Conscription Act was the result of Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to the United States. Labour MP Davies spoke even more vehemently, protesting against the government's militarization of the country in peacetime, and pointing out that the Labour Party had not indicated this action to voters during the election campaign.  Professor Lass, the outgoing chairman of the Labour Party, responded on behalf of the Executive Committee, stating that the government must have the power to defend Britain, and that if conscription were not implemented, only the old-fashioned recruitment system could be used, or special rights given to the army to make it a special class to attract recruits. As a result, the motion opposing the Conscription Act was defeated by 2,332,000 votes to 571,000 votes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Margate, 26th] The Labour Party today voted in favor of the Conscription Act in peacetime to support British foreign policy and curb communism. This indicates that the anti-Bevin forces within the party have clearly weakened, and the "rebels" who believe that the policy excessively follows the United States and is hostile to the Soviet Union have now been overwhelmed. The Labour Party Congress also included two proposals on the agenda to condemn Britain's policy toward Greece and reject the Truman Doctrine's aid to Greece and Turkey, which will be discussed and then voted on. Multiple proposals fiercely criticizing British policy toward Palestine were removed from the agenda and replaced with a single comprehensive proposal reaffirming the Labour Party's view that the Jews should have a "nation" and occupy a majority of the population in the Holy Land.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Again Demands Britain Withdraw from India</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] Today was Gandhi's day of silence. At the prayer meeting, Gandhi did not speak personally, but had someone read his speech, demanding that Britain liberate India's villages and withdraw from India according to the British Cabinet Mission plan of May 16, 1946. The speech also stated: As long as British power remains in India, India cannot manage its own affairs. Britain's task is not to change India, but to withdraw before the promised deadline. I and Jinnah have already issued a joint declaration calling for not using violence to achieve political goals. If the whole country ignores this document and continues to use violence, bloodshed will inevitably occur after Britain withdraws, and the whole world will certainly condemn India.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 26th] Gandhi lost his most treasured watch, which he had carried with him for 25 years, on the way from Patna to Delhi. Nehru visited Gandhi today.</p>
<p>New Cabinet Tries to Avoid Communist Party</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 27th Broadcast: Italy's premier-designate today obtained the approval of most of his Christian Democratic Party members to try to form a government without the participation of the Communist Party and left-wing figures.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 27th Broadcast: Gasperi began organizing a new Italian cabinet, excluding the Italian Communist Party. Gasperi said that the current political crisis will choose one of two methods: (1) organize a Christian Democratic Party cabinet and absorb some nominally independent experts; (2) form a cabinet composed of the Christian Democratic Party and a few left-wing parties. Gasperi said that he could not achieve his goal of a national unity government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 26th] The Italian government crisis still has no hope of resolution. The opposition between Christian Democratic Party leader Gasperi and Socialist Party leader Nenni seems to be the main problem. Gasperi's proposal to expand his former coalition cabinet encountered strong opposition from Nenni, because expansion would put Nenni's left-wing orthodox Socialists on an equal footing with Saragat's breakaway Socialist Party. Nenni spoke in Venice over the weekend, accusing Gasperi of being a tool of the reactionaries and should be fully responsible for this crisis. The discord between Nenni and Gasperi has greatly hindered the work of forming a new government, so it is still difficult to predict whether Gasperi will be able to achieve his wish to expand his original coalition cabinet to accommodate the left and right wings of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party from the middle-of-the-road party.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Nazi Henchmen Executed in Mass Hangings</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rendsburg, 27th] Twenty-two Nazis who massacred humans at the Neuengamme concentration camp were hanged in Rendsburg Prison today, with each execution taking seven minutes. Another twenty-seven concentration camp officials and guards are scheduled to be hanged tomorrow. This is the largest mass execution of war criminals by the Allied forces to date.</p>
<h3>Authorities in the British and American Occupation Zones of Germany Agree on a New Economic Recovery Plan; Establishing an Economic Committee and Giving Germans Broad Powers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 26th] Reliable sources: The talks held in Berlin by General Robertson, commander of the British military district in Germany, and General Clay, commander of the American military district, will be officially announced tomorrow. The communiqué is expected to include the charter for the economic recovery of the two districts. The agreement established by the British and Americans to implement last year's economic merger agreement between the two districts includes the following three points: (1) Establishing a German Economic Committee for the two districts. Reliable sources say that the organization of this committee and its relationship with the state governments have been agreed upon by the British and Americans. This committee will be the most powerful German political organization in western Germany to date. (2) The German industrial level agreed upon by the four powers on March 4, 1946 has been revised. The British and Americans have now decided to allow Germany to produce 10 million to 12 million tons of steel annually, which is the amount proposed by Foreign Secretary Bevin at the recent Moscow Conference. The original four-power agreement stipulated that Germany could have the capacity to produce 7 million tons of steel annually, with actual production limited to 5.8 million tons annually. Within this number, the production level in the British military district is only about 4 million tons, and the actual production is still far lower than the maximum level stipulated by the four powers. Reliable sources say that the aforementioned 10 million to 12 million tons is the actual annual steel production of the British and American districts. In addition, a definitive list has been drawn up of factories in the two districts that can be dismantled for reparations. Similar increases have also been decided for the production of other industries besides the steel industry. This step is tantamount to the beginning of the economic recovery of western Germany. (3) Stipulating that resources in the occupied areas are allowed to be used in a freer manner to import industrial raw materials. It is said that the Robertson-Clay agreement only needs to make some minor final decisions in tomorrow's final talks to be completed. London diplomatic circles generally believe that this agreement shows that the British and American authorities have done their best to prevent the German economic situation from continuing to deteriorate in the transitional period before the establishment of the final four-power agreement.</p>
<h3>Pakenham Returns to England to Submit a Report to Bevin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] Lord Pakenham, Minister for British Occupation Zone Affairs in Germany, returned to London by special plane from Germany tonight with his secretary Jones. After getting off the plane, he refused to issue a statement about his mission in Germany. It is expected that he will go to Margate to meet with Foreign Secretary Bevin to report on his inspection of Germany.</p>
<h3>The United States Decides to Join the International Refugee Organization; House Foreign Affairs Committee Approves</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today unanimously passed a bill approving the US government's participation in the International Refugee Organization. The bill differs from the bill passed by the Senate in two respects. The Senate approved $75 million as the United States' contribution to the International Refugee Organization for the 1948 fiscal year. The House reduced it to $73 million. The committee also stipulated a provision that part of the fund could continue to be used for the American Relief and Refugee Assistance program until the International Refugee Organization began to perform its duties.</p>
<h3>Hoover Responds to Taber; Advocates Making Peace with Germany and Japan Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Regarding the War Department's proposal to allocate $725 million in the next fiscal year to purchase food to assist Germany, Japan, and Korea, Chairman Taber of the House Appropriations Committee sought the opinion of Hoover, Chairman of the Food Emergency Council. It is now known that Hoover has replied to Taber, advocating that the United States should sign peace treaties with Germany and Japan as soon as possible. The letter also condemned the Soviet Union for obstructing the world's economic recovery and stated that if the next four-power foreign ministers' conference still fails, Britain and the United States can sign peace treaties with Germany in their occupied areas.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Orders the Abolition of the Death Penalty; It is Not Stated Whether it Applies to the Soviet Occupation Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] The Soviet Union tonight promulgated a decree abolishing the death penalty, making it the first country in the world to ban capital punishment after the war. According to an official report published by Moscow Radio, although there are still aggressors attempting to provoke wars, the Soviet Union believes that the world has obtained a guarantee of lasting peace, so it has taken this extraordinary action, which is also the result of the Soviet people's loyalty and patriotism. From today, cases sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union will be changed to a maximum term of 25 years in prison. The authorities did not state how many death penalty cases there were, and whether this decree applies to the Soviet occupation zones such as Germany and Austria. The Soviet Union has also never announced the death penalty cases that have already been sentenced in the occupied areas and the number of traitors who have been executed during and after the war.</p>
<h3>President Truman Submits to Congress the American Military Cooperation Act; Aimed at Consolidating Peace in the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Truman today asked Congress to enact legislation for full military cooperation with Latin American countries, including the sale of arms, standardization of weapons, and training of naval and air force personnel. The President's message, read in both the House and Senate, pointed out that "this military cooperation can also be extended to Canada, whose cooperation with the United States on common defense is currently of particular importance." This is the first time that the President has mentioned Canada in the Western Hemisphere defense plan. Canada is neither a member of the Pan American Union nor a signatory of the Chapultepec Treaty, so Canada has not participated in previous discussions on Western Hemisphere defense.</p>
<p>The President's message also said: "The American Republics, in the Chapultepec Treaty and the United Nations Charter, have accepted new responsibilities for mutual defense and the maintenance of peace. The cooperation stipulated in the Chapultepec Treaty makes it necessary for the American Republics to standardize military training and equipment to the greatest extent, based on the recommendations of the American Defense Bureau. Any action stipulated in this case should be in accordance with the articles and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The United States has advanced technical knowledge and economic and military resources, so this responsibility should be borne by the United States. The supply of weapons and military equipment to other American countries has reasonable and limited purposes. The US government will never endorse or participate in the unrestricted distribution of armaments to prevent unnecessary arms competition. The US government should make military development for the purpose of maintaining peace and security, and make the equipment of the army, navy, and air force not exceed the scope of security needs."</p>
<p>Convening a South American Conference to Draft a Defense Pact</p>
<p>The bill proposed by the President will empower the President to conclude the following agreements with other American countries: (1) to train the army, navy, and air force personnel of these countries; (2) to maintain and repair the army, navy, and air force equipment owned by these countries; (3) to transfer weapons, ammunition, and war equipment to these countries under conditions consistent with the needs and national interests of the United States. The President also said: This plan will be included in the US policy of encouraging Latin American economic development. The improvement of living standards and the promotion of social and cultural welfare are prerequisites for international peace and security. In the implementation of this case, other countries should not be hindered from their economic development due to the increase in military burdens. At the same time, it will also prevent any family from using these weapons to oppose the peaceful and democratic principles upheld by the United States and other American countries. Countries that obtain US weapons must not transfer them to third parties. The President also revealed that he would convene a Latin American conference in Rio de Janeiro to draft a Western Hemisphere defense pact.</p>
<p>Strongly Urge the Government to Abandon Imperialist Policies</p>
<p>Another resolution on colonial policy urged the government to abandon its past imperialism and develop the welfare of the colonies to compensate for past mistakes. The case has been accepted by the Executive Committee, and the content requires: (1) Colonial governors should be responsible civil administrators; (2) Indigenous people should be allowed to participate in higher administrative and technical positions; (3) Experts and administrators should be appointed by people who sympathize with the local residents; (4) People of color should be treated equally with white people and given equal opportunities. To achieve this goal, the general educational level should be improved; (5) The development of morning industries should prioritize promoting the employment of indigenous people and improving their living standards. Indigenous people should have full freedom to organize trade unions; (6) The socialist policies of the Colonial Department should be explained in detail to all relevant officials so that they can be implemented quickly.</p>
<h3>Reactions from Both Houses</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Congress did not immediately respond to Truman's call for military cooperation with Western Hemisphere countries. Both the House and Senate seem to feel that his request can wait for some time, but both houses' leaders believe that this plan can be considered in due course.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Speech</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Portland, Oregon, 27th] Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace is now traveling around the United States to promote the peace movement. He delivered a speech here, predicting that the current one-party government in the United States will continue to devote itself to making Europe an anti-Soviet armed camp, which may force Britain, France, Scandinavia, and other European countries to enter the Soviet Union's labor scope.</p>
<h3>Before Massive US Aid to Europe, Economic Cooperation in Europe Should Be Intermediated First; US Plans to Convene a Special International Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] When it was raised in the Senate to convene a special congressional meeting this fall to discuss the US far-reaching aid plan being drafted by the State Department's Policy Committee, another request surged in the Senate, arguing that the United States must promote economic cooperation among European countries before spending another tens of billions of dollars to assist European recovery. Democratic Senator Fulbright and Republican Senator Lodge, who are known as "internationalists," have recently agreed with people in Congress who advocate the establishment of a European Commercial Union. Fulbright, who had vigorously supported the US aid to Europe, said in a recent speech: Unless proper steps are taken to enable European countries to be economically independent through economic cooperation, he may no longer support new aid plans worth billions of dollars. He also said: "Without this development, we will be in a state of bailing water with a sieve." Democratic leaders are now inquiring about opinions on convening a special congressional meeting this fall. They believe that a new aid plan with a vast scope will inevitably cause more protracted disputes. The debate on the aid to Greece and Turkey bill has been delayed by five weeks compared to the scheduled date (end of March), and the debate on the new aid plan will be much longer than that.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] According to Associated Press statistics, the United States has spent approximately $26,684,831,000 on relief and reconstruction of the post-war world from the end of World War II to the end of this year, which is less than 8% of the $1,500 billion spent by the United States on warfare and winning the war.</p>
<h3>The Liberals Firmly Refuse to Participate in the Government; Japan is Preparing to Form a Three-Party Cabinet; The Opposition Between Conservatives and Innovators is Becoming Overt</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Regarding Katayama's plan to form a four-party coalition cabinet, due to the strong attitude of the Liberal Party, he has to proceed towards the formation of a coalition cabinet by the Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties. The Socialist Party held an important meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 7:15 pm on the 27th, attended by important cadres such as Katayama, Nishio, Mizutani, and Hirano. As a result, an agreement was reached on the direction of organizing a new cabinet, but the content has not been publicly announced. It is reported that the work of organizing the cabinet will focus on the Democratic Party, especially on winning over the Ashida faction. So far, the opposition between conservatives and innovators has become overt, and the impact on the future of Japanese politics cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] Japan's new Prime Minister Katayama told reporters on the 27th that Japan needs a coalition cabinet. If other political parties continue not to cooperate, he will immediately organize a cabinet without opposition parties. Katayama's remarks shattered the hopes of some members of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, who hoped that Prime Minister Katayama would resign after failing to organize a four-party coalition cabinet. Katayama also said that he believed that he had the power to organize a one-party cabinet, but hoped that other political parties would not force him to take this step.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party May Split Internally</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] The tripartite summit meeting at 3:00 pm on the 27th was aborted again due to Yoshida's sudden return to Oiso's hometown. The Liberal Party's determination to retreat to the opposition party seems quite firm. Under this new situation, the Democratic Party's movements are worth noting. At 11:00 am today, the party held a cadre meeting. Ashida reported on the progress of the tripartite summit meeting on the 26th and the current attitude of the Liberal Party, and then raised the issue of deciding the Democratic Party's final policy. It was decided that a general meeting of Democratic Party members of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors would be held at 1:00 pm in the afternoon to decide on the party's complex issues. Honorary Chairman Shidehara and Vice Chairman Tanaka both expressed that they should strive to promote the four-party coalition work no matter what. If a three-party coalition cabinet is organized, the party will split. Senior Consultant Saito and Consultants Ichimatsu, Kimura, etc. also agreed with this view, so the Ashida faction had to agree with this statement.</p>
<p>Conservative Members Form an Anti-Communist Front</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] At around 7:00 pm on the 27th, members of the Liberal Party, the Shidehara faction of the Democratic Party, and non-party members jointly convened a discussion meeting aimed at anti-communism. As a result, they unanimously agreed that "political parties should clearly distinguish the boundaries between conservatism and innovation, and we will move towards the goal of organizing a strong conservative front."</p>
<h3>Korean Left-Wing Groups May Express Their Attitude; Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee Still Insist on Two Points</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 27th] During the US-Soviet Joint Commission, visits between political figures were very frequent. General Baillieu invited Mr. Won Se-hoon to his official residence for a meeting today, and Mr. Won visited Mr. Kim Kyu-sik before visiting Baillieu.

It is rumored that Hodge has submitted the two conditions proposed by Rhee and Kim to the US State Department. Syngman Rhee said: "We are not against the US-Soviet Joint Commission, but if there is no proper response to the two conditions we have put forward, we do not intend to participate in the Joint Commission."</p>

<h3>The German Politburo Under Soviet Control</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is establishing a political organization in Berlin, directly connected to the Kremlin, to manage the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany in place of the Red Army. All organizational steps are currently underway, and once formally established, the current military occupation will be replaced by purely civil administration. The purpose of establishing this institution is to ensure the dominance of the German Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<p>Soviet authorities, fearing that they cannot universally win popular support in Germany, are making every effort to ensure that the local Communist Party gains an advantage before taking over German administration.</p>
<p>The organization of this institution is roughly as follows: The central organization of the new German governing body is a politburo modeled after the Moscow organization. Lieutenant General Makarov will be directly dispatched by the Kremlin as a representative to the German Politburo. Mr. Makarov will be the technical assistant to Marshal Sokolovsky, the military commander of the Soviet-occupied zone, responsible for handling all political and economic issues.</p>
<p>The nominal head of the German Politburo is Nadolski, who is not well-known abroad and is in contact with the Secretariat of the Soviet Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Politburo has the following missions: (1) To restore credibility among the German people as soon as possible; (2) To encourage the activities of opposition parties to demonstrate freedom within the Soviet-occupied zone; (3) To improve relations with the United Nations. To strengthen the Communist Party's power, a large number of German leaders have been transferred. Communist veterans Ulbricht and Pieck are plotting behind the scenes, and Pieck's agent, Grotewohl, is preparing to use various tricks to win over German opposition figures.</p>
<p>The origin of the German Politburo lies in the visit to Germany by Beria, a senior Kremlin official. He went to Potsdam for surgery, but during his three-week stay in Germany, he met with Soviet and German leaders in the Soviet-occupied zone. Beria laid the foundation for preparations for the withdrawal of the Allied occupation forces and the eventual transfer of administrative power to the Germans.</p>
<p>The establishment of a new political organization in the Soviet-occupied zone is related to the large-scale withdrawal of Soviet troops in recent months. The number of Soviet troops stationed in Germany has now been reduced to approximately 200,000. Although the Soviet Union's military strength in Germany has thus been weakened, the Soviet Union is striving to strengthen its control through political means.</p>
<p>The Soviet strategy in Germany is a combination of political maneuvering and propaganda.</p>
<p>A political truce between the Christian Democratic Union and the Soviet-backed Socialist Unity Party seems to be an important goal of the Soviet ruling authorities. If these two opposing parties can cooperate in a friendly manner, the Soviet Union can promote Soviet-style democracy. The Soviet Union's real control is behind the scenes, through the Minister of the Interior of the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<p>The political strategy in the Soviet-occupied zone is consistent with the current policies promoted by the Soviet Union in Hungary and the Balkans, namely, to strengthen the political control of the local Communist Party before the withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces.</p>
<p>In order to express goodwill towards the German people, the Soviet Union has allowed an increase in food rations and the supply of clothing, shoes, and other consumer goods.</p>
<p>According to recent reports from journalists who have traveled in the Soviet-occupied zone for several days, the lives of Germans in the Soviet-occupied zone seem to be more comfortable than those of Germans in the western occupation zones. However, for political reasons, anti-Soviet sentiment is extremely high. Germans living in the Soviet-occupied zone resent the strict Soviet politics and express envy for the free lives of Germans in other occupation zones.</p>
<p>The question is how the Soviet Union will fulfill its promises. On the surface, the purpose of the new Politburo is to achieve German unification, but in reality, it continues to conduct anti-Western propaganda. The paper supply to newspapers of the opposition Christian Democratic Union has been reduced by 50 percent, but other newspapers in the Soviet-occupied zone have not been reduced. The Soviet Union's real goal in Germany is simply to expand Soviet power. The Politburo may be a more friendly institution, but its mission is nothing more than to help achieve the above goals.</p>
<h3>Vietnam National United Front Alliance Issues Declaration Supporting the Government</h3>
<p>[Saigon, Agence France-Presse, 27th] Viet Minh Radio today broadcast a declaration of the "Vietnam National United Front Alliance." Observers believe this is a response to accusations of reactionary elements. The declaration stated: This alliance only recognizes the Ho Chi Minh government and denies that any other party has the right to maintain relations with foreign countries. National unity is extremely important to the Viet Minh's war of resistance. So-called national unity means that Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China are ruled by a central government. If the Viet Minh wants true independence, it must become a democratic republic, establish its own national assembly, establish its own government, send its own diplomatic representatives, and have the right to handle internal affairs, finance, economy, and national defense. This alliance will cooperate with France in friendship within the framework of the French Union, based on freedom and equality, it said.</p>
<p>[Saigon, Agence France-Presse, 27th] Well-informed sources said today that the government of the Republic of Vietnam recently submitted several written proposals to the French government, which are currently being studied by the French side and will be answered soon. The contents have not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Indonesia is Tense, the Army is Ready for Battle</h3>
<p>Sunda People's Party Continues to Occupy Railway Line</p>
<p>[Batavia, Agence France-Presse, 26th] General Sudirman, Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Republican Army, issued a broadcast today, ordering the national army to return to their units, ready for battle, and warning that the survival of the Republic of Indonesia is still in danger.</p>
<p>[Batavia, United Press, 26th] The Dutch East Indies government announced today that the Sunda People's Party has occupied the railway between Batavia and Buitenzorg and placed it under the protection of Dutch troops.</p>
<h3>A Famous Native Female Lawyer Will Be Invited to China</h3>
<p>[Ankara, Central News Agency, 27th] The press reported that Miss Agayoglu, a famous Turkish lawyer and prominent figure in the women's movement, has accepted Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's invitation and is currently preparing to travel to China. She lectured in the United States this year. She comes from a famous Turkish family, and her father was one of the leaders of Turkish nationalism in the former Ottoman Empire.</p>
<h3>The First Meeting of the Holy Land Investigation Committee, Trygve Lie Encourages Representatives, The Committee Has Full Power to Conduct a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Lake Success, United Press, 26th] The United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee held its first meeting today, beginning the work of organizing the committee itself and discussing whether to go to refugee camps in Europe for an on-site investigation. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie delivered the opening address, saying: The eleven-nation committee should remember that they represent the beliefs and hopes of millions of people, and that millions of people's faith in the United Nations' ability to carry out this important task depends on the results of the committee's work. Lie pointed out that the committee has the greatest power to seek facts and investigate everything concerning the Palestine issue, the only limitation being the time issue. The committee must submit a report before September 1, so that the member states of the United Nations can study the contents of the report before the regular session of the General Assembly is held in mid-September. At the beginning of its work, the investigation committee knew that the Arab countries insisted that the scope of the investigation be limited to Palestine only. Before the establishment of the committee, the Arab countries had notified in writing that they opposed the committee going to Europe to investigate the refugee camps. There are now various indications that they will receive support from several countries, presumably led by India (also a member of the investigation committee). However, several other neutral countries, such as Sweden, Guatemala, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, have indicated that the European Jewish refugee problem should be related to the entire Palestine problem. The Zionist Organization has not expressed its attitude towards this matter. Dr. Hu Shih-tse, Assistant Secretary-General in charge of trusteeship affairs and representative of China, recently confirmed that the Zionist Organization had requested that observers be sent to accompany the investigation committee. The Zionist Organization guaranteed full cooperation and requested that its representatives be allowed to accompany the investigation committee and maintain contact with the committee.</p>
<h3>American Psychiatrist Invents New Inhalation Therapy That Can Cure Stuttering, Alcoholism, and Other Symptoms</h3>
<p>[Chicago, United Press, 26th] Dr. Meduna, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois, claimed today that the department has been using inhalation therapy to treat alcoholism, stuttering, and other mental illnesses for three years, with about half of the 75 cases being cured. All symptoms such as hysteria, spastic colitis, stuttering, tension, anxiety, emotional unrest, and chronic poisoning can be treated with this method. First, the patient lies on a hammock, covers the nose with a mask, and inhales 15 to 35 times, 30% carbon dioxide and 70% oxygen. In less than an hour, the patient wakes up from a nap and can return home within five minutes. If necessary, treatment is given four times a week, as little as five weeks, as many as 30 weeks. It is not difficult to recover. This procedure seems to have a dual effect, one is to reduce the tension of the brain structure, and the other is to stimulate its relaxation, so as to restore the normal balance of function.</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the Senate, the Mayor Gives a Detailed Analysis of the Explosion of Famine and the Student Unrest, the Focus of the Report is on Stabilizing Social Problems</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The third session of the first Shanghai Municipal Senate held its first meeting at 3 pm yesterday, with the Mayor reporting on the government's administration. Senators raised questions on civil affairs, police, society, finance, and land administration, which were answered by the respective bureau chiefs. The main points of the Mayor's report and the senators' questions at yesterday's meeting focused on stabilizing social problems, especially the rice price.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's administrative report stated briefly that there was already a written report on the routine administration of the municipal government, so he made a special report on the three major current problems of food, workers' lives, and student unrest:</p>
<p>(1) Food problem: Since coming to Shanghai, I have been concerned about the rice price problem every day. Recently, unfortunately, there has been student unrest, which I have been dealing with all day, so I have not had time to take care of the rice crisis, but today the rice price has fallen, and I am now trying my best to suppress it. It happened that three rice crises occurred last year. At that time, the methods of banning hoarding and speculation and throwing out rice in large quantities were adopted, so the three rice crises were stabilized after throwing out less than 200,000 dan of rice in total. However, the situation this year is different. The first time occurred after the gold rush. Recently, since the beginning of April, although 200,000 dan of rice have been thrown out, and about 11,000 dan of rice are still being thrown out every day, the crisis has not subsided. The original plan to deal with it in the same way as last year has not been effective.</p>
<p>Lack of Food Sources</p>
<p>The main reason for the large amount is the lack of rice sources. The rice from the Jiangbei area could be supplied to Jiangnan in the past, but now most of the Jiangbei area is disrupted by the Communist Party, which either steals the stored rice or prevents production, so the area that used to supply rice has now become an area seeking rice. At the same time, Shanghai has always relied on areas such as Bengbu, Wuxi, and Suzhou to supply rice, but now rice shortages have also occurred in these areas, resulting in the current phenomenon. It is estimated that Shanghai needs 500,000 dan of rice every month, but only 300,000 dan can be supplied at present. At the same time, the general public is afraid that there is not enough rice and grain, and often store some in preparation, which is also a reason for increasing the quantity demand. The municipal government is now prohibiting the export of rice from the city on the one hand, and requesting the Ministry of Food to increase allocation on the other hand, which is believed to alleviate the serious situation. In addition, rice merchants are allowed to trade freely, and the method of rationing rice is based on the roster, with strict investigation, so that abuses do not occur.</p>
<p>Workers' Livelihood Problems</p>
<p>(2) Workers' livelihood problem: I am very happy and grateful for the workers' peace of mind, hard work, and diligent production. However, if we want to stabilize workers' lives, we must raise the issue of the cost of living index. I am very much in favor of raising the wages of the workers, but it must be based on the principle of "not exceeding the burden of the production industry." The municipal government has now consulted with the Social Bureau, the General Labor Union, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Industrial Association to decide on a compromise to unfreeze the cost of living index. We believe that the slogan of unconditional unfreezing is detrimental to the workers and will only lead to unemployment.</p>
<p>The reason why the method of compiling the cost of living index cannot be made public is to avoid disputes. The current compiled index must be reviewed by the Review Committee, which is jointly organized by the municipal government, the Senate, the Social Bureau, the Industrial Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and two representatives from the General Labor Union, and is absolutely fair. The method is to investigate the price of goods once every Wednesday. The average of the prices on the last Wednesday of the month and the other three Wednesdays is the cost of living index. After compiling it on Thursday, it will be passed by the Review Committee on Friday and published at the end of the month.</p>
<p>There are Two Points in the Student Unrest</p>
<p>(3) Student unrest problem: We are very protective of young people. I believe that 90% of young people are excellent, but the fact is that some students violate the law and are manipulated and used by others. According to my personal experience, I have found two points, and I dare to determine that there is a background: (1) In a very short period of time, many different events occurred and became related events. (2) The various phenomena seen in the student unrest seem to have the same technique. The government's method is (1) to require stability, and (2) to protect young people (that is, stability first, schooling first). We have to deal with young people who violate the law according to the law. If the school resumes classes, I hope that parents will persuade their children. I am very grateful for the two cases resolved by the Senate.</p>

<h3>Many Questions Raised on the Food Price Problem, Why Has the Amount of Rice, Wheat, and Foreign Exchange Decreased, How Much Benefit Will Rice Rationing Actually Bring, Wu Kaixian Answers Each Item</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The rice price problem is of most concern to the senators. More than a dozen senators raised questions and suggestions to the municipal government:</p>
<p>Shi Zongde raised the issue that the government's approval of the amount of rice and wheat in the second phase of the track entry quota was 13 million US dollars less than in the first phase (the first phase was 20 million US dollars). This is also a major reason for the rise in rice prices, so the government is required to (1) immediately relax foreign exchange, (2) find ways to purchase rice in Sichuan Province, and (3) open warehouses to thoroughly check the inventory.</p>
<p>Zhao Yangxiong raised the following: (1) How many people have actually benefited from the municipal government's implementation of the rice rationing method? (2) The rice rationing method was announced ten days ago, but it has not yet been implemented. When will it be implemented? If the investigation work is insufficient, can more personnel be added to complete it as soon as possible? (3) Rice rationing must be fair and reasonable. Why are other government organizations and institutions not given rice rationing in addition to ordinary public education personnel?</p>
<p>Yao Baozhen raised the following: (1) How to solve the rice problem for ordinary citizens other than public education personnel and citizens? (2) Does the mayor think it is feasible to purchase foreign rice? (3) It is reported that foreign rice and Sichuan rice have arrived. Can the mayor negotiate with the relevant authorities to allocate it to the city as soon as possible? (4) Please pay attention to the technical problems of rice rationing.</p>
<p>Incoming Rice and Grain Cannot Be Fully Distributed</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, then answered each item of the above questions as follows: (1) The purchase of Sichuan rice should be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Food according to the central government's regulations. (2) The rice from other places or overseas is for national use and is distributed by the Ministry of Food. Shanghai is only a place of import, so it cannot request that all of it be allocated to the city. It can only make suggestions and requests to the Ministry of Food to increase the allocation or allocate it first. (3) Although Jiangzhe area, Sichuan, and Hunan have had a good harvest, the amount of assistance needed in other places disrupted by the Communist Party is still very large. (4) We will definitely deal with the rice weevil problem. As long as the investigation is true, we will deal with it strictly and with determination. (5) Whether the establishment of the Food Adjustment Committee will definitely lead to a price drop cannot be guaranteed, but we will do our best to do it, not only not to let it rise, but also to make it fall.</p>
<p>Granting Rice by Headcount Cannot Be Adopted</p>
<p>(6) Occupational workers are not excluded from rice rationing, but there are some restrictions. For example, rickshaw drivers who do not have a fixed employer should be given rice rationing. Those who have an employer but do not provide meals should also be given rice rationing. Only those who have an employer and provide meals will not be given rice rationing. (7) Granting rice by headcount is the most perfect method, but the reason why it is not adopted is that the amount of rice is limited and cannot be distributed equally. At present, we can only rely on our strength to give priority to those who need relief the most, and then gradually expand it. We hope that in the future, everyone in Shanghai will be able to receive one dou of rice per month, but at present, everyone can only receive three sheng per month.</p>
<p>Director Wu also answered Fang Rusheng's question, "The Factory Inspection Law has been promulgated for ten years, why has it not been implemented?" He replied that this inspection law is handled by the Public Works Bureau. If the Social Bureau needs to handle it, the Ministry of Social Affairs can be asked to discuss with the municipal government to set up a Mining Industry Inspection Committee.</p>
<h3>"Burn, Strike, Beat, Chaos, Delay, Blame, Push, Forget", Recover the Racecourse, Prevent Mass Demonstrations, The Mayor Answers One by One</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Other questions in yesterday's meeting included Zhang Zhongyuan asking: What is the progress of recovering the racecourse? Tao Baichuan suggested: (1) Before the racecourse is recovered, first negotiate to open it for citizens to rest. (2) I heard that there will be a general strike and demonstration in the city on June 2. How will the mayor prevent it? I would like to hear about it. He also suggested that the Senate send representatives to establish a committee to act as a liaison and enter various schools to do guidance work to assist the mayor in solving the major problems. Chen Gaoyong described the current situation as: "Burn, strike, beat, chaos," and the municipal government's handling of affairs as "delay, blame, push, forget." Wang Weiwen said: There is no fixed location for paying various taxes to the Finance Bureau, which is extremely inconvenient for the people. The procedures are complicated, and the handling is unsystematic, and improvements are required.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu replied: (1) Regarding the strike and demonstration on June 2, strict measures have been prepared, but it is not convenient to announce them publicly. If the senators wish to inquire, we can exchange opinions at another time. (2) I very much agree with and express my gratitude for the suggestion that the senators organize a committee to assist in the guidance work. (3) Regarding the recovery of the racecourse, after discussion, the other party believes that if the Jiangwan suburban area is exchanged, it can be agreed in principle, but repair fees must be paid. As for the use of the interior of the racecourse, because it is now leased by the US Military Sports Association, it must be exchanged with an area in the western suburbs of Shanghai with convenient transportation before it can be done. However, a formal plan must wait until the person in charge of the racecourse returns to Shanghai from the country before it can be carried out. It may not be easy to open it as a park, because its houses and land have been leased separately, but the municipal government will do its best to negotiate. (4) The "burn, strike, beat, chaos" is obviously manipulated by thugs. The municipal government will definitely try its best not to "delay, blame, push, forget."</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Office, because Jia Dechao asked, "Director Zhang seems to have a suspicion of monopolizing the election. I am afraid he wants to be the elected mayor," expressed his deep feelings. He said, "I have no ambition to be the mayor, and I am already at this age, and it is simply impossible in fact. As for the use of people, I will definitely be responsible for handling it according to the law. The last time a certain official violated the law, I even went to court to prove that he violated the law." Others such as Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, also successively answered the questions.</p>
<h3>More Than a Dozen Petitioners</h3>
<p>[This Miscellaneous News] More than a dozen people went to the Municipal Senate to petition yesterday, including: (1) The parents of the eleven arrested students of Datong University, requesting that the students be released on bail. (2) The Shanghai Liquor and Dishes Industry Association requested that the starting point of the banquet tax be quickly adjusted according to the current price ratio. At the same time, the Finance Bureau changed the government order, ordering merchants to pay the banquet tax on behalf of the sales of beer and soda, and the merchants could not pay the compensation. A letter was sent to request the Senate to consult and still maintain the original case in the autumn of last year. It also requested the deletion of the words "cold drinks" in the draft collection rules for the surplus banquet tax to prevent disputes. (3) The Zhabei District People's Representative Council requested to stop Wang Qingji from illegally levying the finger quota for the private construction of public toilets, and to transfer him to the judicial organ for strict handling. It also requested that his illegal bid of 360 million yuan be confiscated and transferred to reward private schools and municipal health construction. It also requested the government to issue an order to abolish the donation of paper for private services. (4) The Shanghai Yuhang Bank came to petition because it could not open after the emergency economic measures plan was announced. (5) The Silver Building Industry Vocational Union requested to restore the sale of jewelry gold. (6) The Rickshaw Driving Industry Vocational Union requested to ban illegal and falsely established rickshaw companies. (7) Wang Zhuzhai represented the request to issue licenses to unlicensed rickshaws. (8) The Laohuzhao in Yangzhou Road Sanfang requested the promulgation of the rules and regulations for the Laohuzhao industry. (9) Peng Chusheng and other representatives requested to issue vendor licenses. (10) Four student representatives of Chengde Elementary School requested to preside over the public announcement because the school building was forcibly occupied by soldiers. (10) (1) The Caoyi Elementary School also came to petition because the school building was forcibly occupied by the Changning Road Sub-Bureau. (12) The pre-war residents of Ruikangli, Ruifengli, and other five alleys in Jiaxing Road requested to return to their residences.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhihong's Coffin Transported to Shanghai, Died in a Plane Crash Before His Ambition Was Fulfilled</h3>
<p>Martyr Chen Zhihong came to Shanghai from Chongqing in 1944 to participate in the defection work of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department. On January 7, 1945, he personally led the pseudo-air force personnel, along with three enemy aircraft, to depart from the Changzhou enemy airfield and drive back to the interior. He knew that the aircraft was flying over the Xiaofeng County area of Zhejiang Province, when suddenly snow and ice covered the sky, and the direction could not be distinguished. Unfortunately, the aircraft that Martyr Chen was riding in crashed on the Tianmu Mountain, and he died heroically. Now, the family of Martyr Chen personally went to the area at the beginning of this month to find his remains, which were transported to Shanghai for burial yesterday afternoon. The air force personnel who defected that year and the representatives of the party and youth organizations in the city went to the Suzhou River to respectfully welcome the coffin. The remains of the pilot Liu Bingqiu, who died in the same plane crash, were also transported to Shanghai by the Chen family.</p>
<h3>Widening of Tianmu Road Section, Northern Engineering Completed</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The section of Tianmu Road from Zhejiang North Road to Henan North Road in this city has always been the main road for entering and leaving the North Railway Station. In the past, before the concession was abolished, the area was the dividing line between the concession and the Chinese area, and jurisdiction could not be unified. The Public Works Bureau then followed the suggestions of the Jinghu Railway Bureau and the Municipal Senate and actively widened and reorganized the area. Because the southern part of the area involved more civilian houses, it was decided to start with the 21-meter width of the North Railway Station, and the 14-meter width of the southern part would be expanded in the second half of this year to allow the public sufficient time to move. The northern engineering was completed on the 19th of this month. The road is quite magnificent after the renovation, and there is no danger of congestion as in the past. The southern engineering is also being planned, but the demolition of houses still needs the understanding of the public.</p>
<h3>Xiamen-Manila Route, Hailong Wheel Will Resume Sailing</h3>
<p>The Xiamen-Manila route of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been suspended for a long time. In order to strengthen the passenger and cargo transportation business between South China and various parts of Southeast Asia, the company has decided to resume sailing by the Hailong Wheel in the short term. The Hailong is currently being fitted with berths on this route.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Charity Organization Reorganizes Business</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Organization was greatly affected by the "August 13" war, and many of its houses were destroyed, resulting in the suspension of various businesses. Now, the board of directors of the organization has requested the Social Bureau to organize a reorganization committee to actively adjust the affairs of the organization. Recently, in addition to sorting out the houses and bases of the organization, the routine charitable activities such as burying exposed corpses, transporting and burying the Yizhong, and giving away wooden coffins are still being strengthened and effectively handled. In the blink of an eye, summer is approaching, and the burial work is crucial to public health. It is hoped that if citizens find anything, they will immediately call the organization (60774) or (61104), and they will go to collect and bury it at any time.</p>
<h3>US Memorial Day to be Marked with Memorial Ceremony</h3>
<p>On the 30th, the United States Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers, US military and American expatriates in Shanghai will hold a grand memorial ceremony at the bottom of the Jing'an Temple Road Cemetery at 8:30 am.

<h3>Senate Appeals for Peace in Telegram: Urges Communists to Abandon Prejudice of Relying on Military Strength; Requests Government to Order Ceasefire and Await Unified Reorganization within a Limited Time</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the temporary emergency resolution passed the day before yesterday, the Secretariat of the Municipal Council sent telegrams yesterday to the leaders of the National Government and the Communist Party, appealing for peace. It also sent telegrams to the National Political Council, the councils of various provinces, cities, and counties, and various legal entities, urging them to unite and promote the realization of peace. This telegram was amended and passed by the General Assembly yesterday. The original telegram to the National Government and to Mr. Mao Zedong are as follows:</p>
<p>To Mr. Mao Zedong: After the victory in the War of Resistance, our country was honored as one of the four great powers, and we were fortunate to have the foundation of the country re-established, with the prospect of national construction. However, you led the Communist army to rebel against the government, causing chaos within the country, with flames of war everywhere, causing suffering to the people and weakening the country's strength. In the past, the government longed for peace and repeatedly invited you to discuss matters, but you, relying on your military strength, failed to overcome your prejudices, resulting in years of peace talks without a ceasefire. The responsibility for this continuous war that harms the people and the country is obvious to all and cannot be concealed by one hand. Now that constitutional government is about to be implemented, any political party can legally participate in politics, and the government sincerely hopes that you will work together to plan the country's future. Therefore, it has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve the current domestic disputes through political means. However, in recent days, the situation has become increasingly tense, with frequent war reports, indicating that your attitude is becoming more extreme. If this continues, the country will cease to exist, and when the nest is overturned, no egg can remain intact. You are also a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, how can you lack a sense of national identity? Please rein in your horse at the edge of the cliff, time is running out. In view of this, this council, at the first meeting of the third session of the first congress, passed a unanimous resolution by all senators, willing to offer its final advice to you and the Chinese Communist Party, deeply hoping that you will prioritize the country and the people, resolutely abandon the prejudice of relying on military strength to dominate, and then lay down your arms and declare a ceasefire, so that transportation can be restored and peace talks can be reopened. It is also hoped that you will come to Beijing to discuss and resolve national affairs, turning hostility into friendship, and eliminating violence for peace and harmony. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. Otherwise, if you stubbornly cling to your prejudices and use military force to harm the country, you will be held responsible, and the people will no longer forgive you. What to do, please consider carefully. Shanghai Municipal Council, sincerely.</p>
<p>To the National Government in Nanjing: The construction of the country must be based on unity, and the prosperity of society must be based on stability. Since the victory, the government has longed for peaceful unification, and the people have longed for rest and recuperation. However, the Chinese Communist Party has occupied territory with its troops, making progress inch by inch, destroying discipline and losing national integrity. It has never been sincere in ending the war, resulting in years of peace talks being abandoned, the flames of war becoming increasingly fierce, the country's reputation declining, and the people's livelihood becoming difficult. We, the members of this council, looking at the overall situation, are extremely worried. Therefore, at the first meeting of the third congress, we unanimously proposed an emergency motion to send a telegram to the government, urging it to set a deadline for the Chinese Communist Party to lay down its arms as soon as possible, await unified reorganization, send representatives to Beijing, and resume peace talks. The central government should still regard them as a political party, cease fighting on the spot, and not pursue them. Otherwise, the government should concentrate its efforts and issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion, so as to end the military affairs as soon as possible, promote national unity, and lay the foundation for lasting peace. Recorded in the minutes. In addition to sending another telegram to the Chinese Communist Party to offer a final admonition and urge them to awaken, we hereby send this telegram for your review. We respectfully request that you heed the situation and adopt our suggestions. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiluan, Vice Speaker, and all the senators, sincerely.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhongyuan and Huang Zhensheng proposed that starting today, during the afternoon break at 5:00 pm, each person (including guests and news reporters) should be given two steamed buns to satisfy their hunger, which has been approved by the speaker. While Mayor Wu was reporting on the student unrest, suddenly the sound of a military band playing on the street below was heard. The reporters, senators, and the mayor were all stunned, thinking that the students had come to disrupt the meeting. Little did they know that it was actually the Shanghai Municipal Dance, Western Food, Coffee, Theater, Hotel, and Restaurant Association, which had sent a troop of Boy Scouts to present a black plaque with gold lettering, titled: "The Voice of Democracy." During the meeting break, all the senators went to Kunshan Garden to watch the fire extinguisher demonstration.</p>

<h3>"76" Executioner, Xia Zhongming, Sentenced to Death; Wife Sobbed Upon Hearing the Verdict, Request to See Him Denied</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Xia Zhongming, former Deputy Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, accused of being a traitor, was sentenced yesterday morning at the High Court. Judge Xiao, accompanied by Prosecutors Qiu and Ding, took their seats, and the bailiffs brought Xia Zhongming to the court. Xia was wearing a blue cloth long gown, his back slightly bent, and his complexion still good. After Judge Xiao inquired about the defendant's age and origin, he stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Xia Zhongming, colluding with the enemy, plotting to rebel against his own country, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for the family." Then he sat down and explained the reasons for the judgment, saying: "During his tenure in the puppet government, the defendant engaged in espionage work, arrested employees of the Bank of China, causing a major bloodbath, and sent people to assassinate Zhu Zuotong, the publisher of the China-America Evening Post, and Yu Hua and Qian Hongye, the two criminal court judges of the Shanghai Second Special District Court. In the 34th year, he organized the Fuxing Company, serving as the general manager, and purchased military grain and materials for the enemy, his crimes are serious, so he is sentenced to the maximum penalty. If he does not agree with the judgment, he may apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days after receiving the judgment." The defendant was quite calm when he heard the judgment, while his wife and daughter in the audience sobbed incessantly. Defense lawyer Chen Zhen requested the court to allow the defendant to meet with his family, but Judge Xiao refused and ordered the bailiffs to immediately return the defendant to the detention center.</p>
<p>Xia Zhongming, a native of Suzhou, is 46 years old this year, graduated from the Japan Commercial College, and was originally the chief clerk of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he served as the Director of Military Supplies of the Headquarters of the Shanghai National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps.

<h3>Ping Zuren Martyrdom Case: High Court Summons Cart Driver</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Former Jiangsu Provincial Administrative Inspector and Special Commissioner Ping Zuren, a martyr, was arrested by the puppet special agents for engaging in underground work in Shanghai during the War of Resistance. His wife was also arrested at the same time. The enemy and the puppet regime tried every means to induce him to surrender, but Martyr Ping remained unyielding and was killed after being detained for more than a year. Mrs. Ping was released the next day. After the victory, the chairman summoned her and inquired in detail about the martyrdom of Martyr Ping. The murderer who killed Martyr Ping has not yet been arrested. Because his cart driver, Li Lianfu, is highly suspected, Judge Xiao of the High Court summoned Li to court for questioning yesterday morning. Mrs. Ping also came to court to testify. Li Lianfu categorically denied any involvement in the murder of Martyr Ping. After the court hearing, due to lack of evidence, he was ordered to be released on bail pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi to Visit the United States in Autumn; Discussed Overseas Missions with Reporters Yesterday; Plans to Visit Europe and Nanyang</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Kong Xiangxi told reporters yesterday when they met with him that: "I will go to the United States in July. In addition to a medical examination, I need to handle the following matters: (1) I am the chairman of the board of directors of Yenching University and Mingxian College. These two schools have relationships with the United States, and there are some matters that need to be dealt with; (2) I am the person in charge of the Sino-American Cultural Association. The purpose of the association is to promote friendly relations between the two countries. The publisher of the American Life magazine, Luce, once donated houses to help Chinese students study in the United States. Also, some people in the United States have recently launched a world citizen movement, and I am one of the initiators. All of these matters need to be discussed in the United States." Mr. Kong also said: "In the future, I plan to visit Europe and Nanyang once. Currently, domestic industry and commerce cannot supply goods to overseas Chinese in Nanyang due to funding and other reasons, which is a pity. In the future, I hope to use the funds of the Bank of China to assist domestic industry and commerce and transport goods to Nanyang through remittance methods." Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Mr. Kong believes that the Communist problem should be resolved through political means. The government has always hoped for peace and believes that if the Communist Party sends representatives, the government will be willing to reopen peace talks. Discussing the current student unrest, Mr. Kong said: "If students are dissatisfied, they can send a small number of representatives to make requests. There is no need for a full-scale strike. Young people are full of energy and are easily exploited. I hope that young people will cherish their studies in this difficult situation." Also, Mo Dehui brought back a letter from Zhang Xueliang to Mr. Kong from Taiwan this time, and he expressed his gratitude for his concern. When reporters asked if the central government intended to reuse Mr. Zhang after he regained his freedom, he replied: "The current environment is complicated, and I am afraid that he will be exploited. It is better to let him rest."</p>
<h3>Eight Representatives of the Shipping Industry Went to Beijing Last Night to Petition</h3>
<p>The National Shipping Industry Joint Conference resolved to send representatives to the government to present the current serious crisis of China's shipping industry and its rescue methods. Eight representatives, including Qian Xinzhi, Yang Guanbei, Hu Shiyuan, Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Cheng Yuzhai, Zhong Shandao, and Shi Fuchang, were elected and traveled to Beijing by train last night. Today, Qian Xinzhi will lead them to visit Chairman Chiang, President Zhang Qun, and Minister Yu Dawei to report on the efforts of China's shipping industry to recover and revive in the past year and a half. They will also present the contents of the ten urgent measures for the shipping industry proposed by the representatives of the shipping industry from all over the country at the joint conference held in Shanghai recently, regarding the adjustment of freight and passenger fares and the supply of fuel. The representatives of the shipping industry will go to Beijing with sincerity and determination to request the government to implement emergency measures so that the domestic shipping industry, which has just seen a glimmer of hope, will not fall into the abyss of bankruptcy again.</p>
<h3>Speed Up the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets; Deadline for Submitting Property Ownership Documents by the End of the Month; All Unclaimed Assets Will Be Confiscated by the State</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area has received and seized enemy and puppet assets. Some of them have already been auctioned off, but some of them cannot be processed due to property rights disputes, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also received continuous claims from citizens or people of allied countries, stating that certain properties are not enemy or puppet assets and belong to them. Now, the office believes that all enemy and puppet assets should originally be owned by the government. For those who claim the right to the enemy and puppet assets and request their return, it was previously stipulated that they should submit property ownership documents within a limited time, but some have not yet submitted their documents. Now, in order to strengthen the handling of enemy and puppet assets and to respect the property rights of citizens or people of allied countries, the deadline for submitting property ownership documents has been extended to the end of this month, with four days remaining. After four days, those who do not submit property ownership documents will be treated as enemy and puppet assets and confiscated by the government. There will be no further extension.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Social Bureau Staff, Forging Ration Coupons to Collect Money; Many Fabric and Dyeing Factories Deceived</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Bureau has recently received reports that someone is forging the bureau's seal and issuing false material ration coupons to extort money. The person is about thirty years old, of medium build, with a thin, dark face, long hair, speaking with a Shanghai accent, wearing a Melton Zhongshan suit, and carrying a black briefcase. He claimed to be named Wu and went to small fabric factories in the Jin Shenfu Road area last week, claiming: "The Social Bureau is about to distribute materials. Each factory can receive real objects once a month, calculated at the market price in January of this year." He also asked whether each factory had registered with the Social Bureau for industry and commerce. After saying this, he took out a material ration coupon with a stamped seal and instructed them to fill it out and submit it to the Social Bureau. Each ration coupon cost 30,000 yuan. The factories, believing that he was a staff member of the Social Bureau and that there were cheap materials to be rationed, believed him at the time. After a few days, they learned that the Social Bureau did not have a material ration coupon, and they realized that they had been deceived. After receiving the report, the Social Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate with the Lujiawan Police Station. The victims include Dafeng Fabric Factory, Huachang Fabric Factory, Yongyi Fabric Factory, Datong Medicinal Cotton Fabric Factory, and Zhongfu Dyeing and Weaving Factory. The numbers of the false coupons include 2586 and 2590. The Social Bureau is deeply concerned that such incidents will occur again. In addition to sending a letter to the police station for investigation, it also instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Dyeing and Weaving Industry Guild to pay attention to prevention.</p>

<h3>Painter Wang Yachen Sues Tenant for Eviction; Reason for Recovering for Own Use Insufficient, Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of "Goldfish Painter" Zhu Yachen suing Zhang Shengsong for eviction due to the termination of the lease was ruled by the district court yesterday. The main text of the ruling was: "The plaintiff's claim and the request for provisional execution are dismissed, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff." It is said that Wang did not accept the ruling and will appeal to the High Court. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff and another painter, Xu Langxi, jointly founded the Xinhua Art College and the Xinhua Art Normal School, with Xu Langxi and the plaintiff serving as principals, respectively. They were approved for registration by the Ministry of Education in the 21st and 24th years, respectively. The school addresses were the buildings at No. 15, 16, and 18, Lane 155, Jianguo Middle Road. Later, they automatically suspended operations during the enemy-puppet period and rented the front building and bathroom pavilion on the second and third floors of Building 18 to the defendant for residence, with a term of three years, from February 15, 33rd year to February 14, 36th year, and a lease agreement was established. After the victory, the Ministry of Education approved the resumption of the school, but because the lease term had not expired, and they had applied to the "Housing Allocation Committee of Various Agencies in Shanghai of the Executive Yuan" for housing allocation, they did not achieve their goal, and the school affairs are still suspended. When the lease term expired, the defendant refused to move out, so Wang sued the district court. Judge He Xianzhang of the district court rejected the claim based on Article 100 of the Land Law, saying that the plaintiff's reason for recovering the property for his own use was not sufficient.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The news item "Small Owner of Enamel Factory Injures Son of Gambling Table Boss in Car Accident" published in your newspaper on the 27th is inconsistent with the facts. Mr. Dong Shuying is the assistant manager of our company. Our company is a joint-stock company. It is inappropriate to say "small owner". On the day in question, Mr. Dong was traveling by car from the main factory on Jumen Road, Nanshi, and was passing by Zhonghua Road, which is a one-way traffic area from south to north. The tricycle involved in the accident was coming from north to south. In order to avoid the car, it turned and overturned in front of the car three feet away. There was no contact with the car at all. The passenger was injured when the car overturned. I hope you will correct this. Sincerely, Yifeng Enamel Factory Co., Ltd.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(I) Resolving Legal Disputes</p>
<p>Jian Heng asks: I have several legal questions and seek your answers: (1) In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], A borrowed 800 national currency units from B, with an annual interest rate of 18%. A title deed was provided as collateral, with a term of one year. Upon expiration, B demanded repayment from A, but A repeatedly delayed and has not repaid anything to date. What crime has A committed in law? Is it fraud? (2) When filing a lawsuit, can I demand repayment of 2,000 times the original amount? (3) Is it reasonable in law for the interest to exceed the principal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] (1) Failure to repay a debt upon maturity is not a criminal act. (2) Suing for repayment of a debt is a civil lawsuit. The court fairly determines the amount of compensation; there are no legal provisions specifying a multiple of the principal or interest. (3) Interest not exceeding the principal is found in the Qing Code, but there is no such provision in current law. However, the right to claim interest expires if not exercised within five years, as stipulated in Article 126 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>(II) Inheritance of Estate</p>
<p>Wang Yusheng asks: I previously read in your newspaper's legal inquiries that the Inheritance of Estate Regulations stipulate that property allocated more than five years ago should not be included in the estate. However, I do not know from which year the five years are calculated. The property I currently own was a gift from my late father in the 32nd year [1943]. I wonder if it will be included in the estate.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] Article 8 of the Estate Tax Law states that property divided or gifted within five years before the death of the deceased should be regarded as part of the estate and taxed uniformly. It can be seen that the five-year calculation compares the date of division or gifting with the date of death.</p>

<h2>Page 5</h2>
<h3>Student Unions of Various Universities in the City Decide Today to Suspend Classes and End the Strike Mayor Wu Agrees to Release Students from Jinnan and Datong Universities</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The student unrest in the city improved yesterday. The student unions of various universities have decided that from today onwards, all universities will suspend classes and end the strike. Five representatives of the union went to the Municipal Government at noon yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu and demanded the release of the arrested students from Jinnan and Datong Universities the day before, and the severe punishment of the perpetrators who beat Fudan University students the night before. Mayor Wu agreed to release the students of Jinnan University, but the students of Datong University would be released three days after consultation with their respective schools. As for the beating of Fudan University students, Mayor Wu said that he had not yet received a report. The representatives left at about 1 p.m. and convened a representative meeting in the afternoon, deciding to suspend classes and end the strike from today onwards, and formally resume classes after Mayor Wu's answers to all the questions are resolved.</p>
<h3>Students of Datong University Visited the Mayor Yesterday Presented Four Demands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Datong University students presented four demands. Thousands of students were arrested on the 26th due to a fight. Yesterday at 11:00 a.m., more than ten student representatives from the school went to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu and presented four demands: (1) Release the arrested students, (2) Compensate the injured students for medical expenses, (3) Severely punish the perpetrators, (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Mayor Wu promised to investigate fairly. The student representatives bid farewell and returned to school at about 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>[Another report] Regarding the fight between two factions of Datong University students the day before, the Jiangning Road Police Precinct ordered police to the scene and arrested eleven students according to martial law and sent them to the Garrison Headquarters for processing. Later, they were transferred to the Municipal Police Bureau and temporarily detained at the Lujiawan Police Precinct. The school's students then gathered two or three hundred students at 2:30 p.m. yesterday and marched to the precinct in formation. Representatives were sent to visit Chief Zhao of the precinct, requesting the release of the detained students. Chief Zhao and Section Chief Hao explained that the students were being held for temporary custody and that they had no power to release them. They accompanied the representatives to the detention center to meet with the detained students. The police局 provided exquisite meals, tea, and noodle soup every day for the sake of preferential treatment and provided several newspapers for entertainment. The detained students and representatives were satisfied and left at 6:45 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Did Not Resume Classes Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Some students of Fudan University held a meeting at the school at 9:00 p.m. on the 26th to welcome the five released students. Shortly after leaving the school gate after the meeting, they suddenly clashed with some students outside the gate, throwing stones at each other. Gunshots were heard twice in the chaos. Upon hearing the news, the Xinshi Street Police Precinct sent personnel to suppress the situation and sent sixteen injured people, including Zhang Xiwu and Chen Shanshu, to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment, and took three students suspected of committing the crime to the precinct for interrogation. Due to insufficient evidence, they were released on bail pending trial at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Fudan students originally scheduled to resume classes yesterday, but after this incident, they announced an informal strike. Yesterday, the school's Student Union established the "May 26th Bloodshed Incident Support Committee" to investigate the truth of the case and demand the punishment of the perpetrators. Principal Zhang Yi felt that the student unrest was difficult to deal with and reportedly telegraphed the Ministry of Education yesterday morning requesting resignation.</p>
<p>Also: The report on the mutual beating of Fudan University students the night before, which was published in this newspaper yesterday, was received by telephone report. After investigation yesterday, it was found that it differed somewhat from the actual situation at the time and is hereby corrected. As for Principal Zhang's resignation, it is said that all professors, students, and alumni will earnestly try to retain him.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] According to representatives of the Student Union of Jiaotong University, the "May 20th Support Committee" did not make a resolution to march yesterday (27th). The news of the march released by the Central News Agency is inaccurate. The students' demands are now very simple, that is, to release all the arrested students before classes can be resumed immediately. Although 90 students who had been arrested before were released yesterday, at the same time, a large number of students from Jinda and Datong Universities were arrested, and fights occurred continuously at Fudan, Datong, and Jinda Universities, which made it impossible to resume classes immediately.</p>

<h3>Henan University Student Protection Group Strives for Early Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Kaifeng, 27th] Henan University has experienced a strike by professors and a strike by students for 25 days, with no hope of resuming classes. The School Protection Group, organized by a portion of the students, recently issued declarations everywhere and insisted that the "anti-civil war" movement by another portion of the students was inappropriate to maintain the strike for a long period. The School Protection Group argued strongly for the early resumption of classes to avoid wasting their studies, expressing dissatisfaction in the declaration with the "political" students stirring up the nature-changing student unrest. This led to obstruction of the School Protection Group's resumption movement. The forces of both sides are confronting each other on campus, with a strong sense of terror. The "political struggle" atmosphere is dense with writing on the democratic walls. All circles here express deep regret. In addition, the Zhongyuan Institute of Technology, which responded to the student unrest and went on strike for many days, has resumed classes today.</p>

This plan was first conceived a year and a half ago. At that time, the Veterans Association believed that sending students to study in foreign countries, especially in countries with advanced scientific and technical skills, would greatly contribute to the promotion of international relations, so this proposal was made.

<h3>Zhejiang Pharmaceutical College Will Soon Be Changed to Medical College</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 27th] Zhejiang Provincial Pharmaceutical College has been in operation for 40 years and has achieved remarkable results. The school previously requested that the school be changed to a college.

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 27th] Regarding the matter of self-funded students going abroad, a reporter from this agency has been informed by authoritative sources as follows: (1) University graduates who have obtained foreign university scholarships of more than US$80 per month (in cash or in the form of room, board, tuition, etc.) can be allowed to go abroad.

Currently, self-funded students are requesting to purchase at an exchange rate of 3,350 yuan, but the government has not yet made a decision on this. (4) Those who have obtained admission permits from foreign universities without passing the Ministry of Education's examination, because the difficulty of obtaining admission permits is considered, are currently considering "allowing these students to go abroad this year," but these students must submit documents proving that they have sufficient funds for their studies.

<h3>Basketball Committee of the Stadium Banqueted the Zhenglun Team Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Zhenglun Basketball Team has achieved excellent results in this expedition to Shanghai, winning many battles. In order to fulfill the hospitality of the host and celebrate its success, the Basketball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association and the Municipal Stadium held a banquet at the Linyuan Hotel on Linsen Middle Road at 7:00 p.m. yesterday, inviting the team leader Wu Jian and all team members, accompanied by players from various basketball teams, referees from the referee association, sports journalists, and relevant parties, totaling more than 100 people, gathered together.

<h3>Table Tennis League</h3>
<p>The Band Team Lost to Taishan</p>
<p>In the second Shanghai Table Tennis League, four games were played the night before at the Jingfen and Postal ballrooms, respectively. The First Division League Municipal faced the Second Division China and Zhongyou teams. When the time came, the China players had not arrived, and the League Municipal generals won the victory without moving their swords. In the battle against Zhongyou, Zhongyou won the first battle. Initially, the League Municipal did not dare to be careless. The attack was quite smooth, and it won five consecutive rounds. As a result, it defeated Zhongyou with five to two. In addition, the Second Division White Team was ambitious and actually defeated Zhejiang Xing with a straight seven, standing undefeated alongside the two strong teams Jingwu and Hualian in the same division. The soldiers of the White Team are all newcomers, and with this record, they can also be proud. In the second act, the Third Division Band Team competed with Taishan. The former won five battles and five victories, and its momentum was strong. The latter had lost to Xinsheng Hong once, and its reputation had been lowered a lot, so the battle was extremely laborious. The Band Team unfortunately lost its normal performance due to the loss of the handball master Fan Songqing, which led to the poisonous hand of Lu Shitang on the other side, losing the foundation for victory. It was even more a pity that the team leader Chen Pengyao in the final group could have won but did not win. As a result, Taishan defeated the Band Team with a score of four to three, and there was still a chance for the team to win the championship. The Band Team missed a good opportunity, not because its skills were not good, but because it lacked experience.</p>
<p>There will be three more games tonight. In the Fourth Division, Seed Post A will meet the rising star Qingniao. Although Post A can be sure of winning, on the individual side, it may be difficult to win all. In addition, the Hualian female generals will play against Chunmao. Although the Hualian females have won six battles in Yingbei, each performance is not weaker than the Textile Fourth Dongchang team. The peak of Chunmao athletes' ball is only slightly higher, and if they do not fight hard tonight, they may be disgraced by the female generals.</p>

<h3>Tight Credit Forces Retail Closings - Chinese Stocks Continue to Decline Yesterday - Limited Trading, Uncertain Prospects</h3>

<h3>Newspaper Import Quota: Publishing Industry Appeals for Relaxation</h3>
<p>The publishing industry in this city recently telegraphed Secretary-General Shao of the Nanjing National Senate to forward to the presidium of the Senate, requesting the National Government to relax the import quota for newspapers for this quarter. The original telegram is excerpted below: "To Secretary-General Shao of the Nanjing National Senate, transferred to the presidium: The Import Quota Allocation Office decided today that the national newspaper import for May, June, and July will only be increased by 30% compared to the previous period.

The Chairman of the Shanghai Booksellers Association, Li Bojia, and the Chairman of the Shanghai Newspaper Publishers Association, Li Zikuan, respectfully submit."</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Executive Committee to Meet Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee was originally scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM yesterday. Temporarily, because the committee members Liu Gongyun and Chief of the Secret Investigation Department Chen Junren went to Beijing a few days ago, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting, and no formal resolutions were made. The committee has now rescheduled the meeting for tomorrow. In addition, the secretariat of the committee recently hired Wang Nianzu as the deputy director. Mr. Wang has already assumed his duties.</p>
<h3>449 Applications to Transport Zhangjiagang Cloth to North China</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Textile Control Commission is handling the matter of transporting controlled yarn and cloth to the ports of Northeast and Hebei. Currently, 449 foreign manufacturers have applied for registration. The committee has begun reviewing the applications and will begin accepting applications for the transportation of yarn and cloth to the north in a week.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Rayon are Weak - Uniform Price Decline - Factory-Processed Silk and Fabric are Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the actual sales of rayon in the market were weak because silk factories had temporary allocations that could be used. Furthermore, due to the relationship between those in the industry and their cash flow, they urgently wanted to sell their goods for cash, so the opening price of No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang was 17.4 million yuan, and it fell all the way down to 7 million yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 1.1 million yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the cash flow was leveled, and the holders were unwilling to sell at low prices, so the asking price rose again, and finally it was sold for 7.5 million yuan, which was still 600,000 yuan less than the previous day. Dongyang and Xu characters also rose and fell accordingly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the factory-processed fabrics were quiet again, and the asking price was slightly weaker. A grade of B-level fabrics sold for 20.85 million yuan, 150,000 yuan less than the previous day. A few packages of Tanheng striped fabric were also sold for 18.5 million to 8.8 million yuan. No transactions were heard for the remaining grades.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of silk and quilt covers in the city was about 200,000 yuan lower than the previous day. A Huajiang quilt cover was sold for 7.7 million yuan. Dacheng checkered wall crepe opened at 30,700 yuan and finally sold for 500 yuan, a decrease of slightly less than 1,000 yuan from the previous day. A Huajin crepe was wanted for 14,000 yuan in the morning, but due to the decline in rayon, it was sold for 3,500 yuan in the afternoon. Due to the busy silkworm season in the countryside, Sheng goods were rarely shipped, so the market price in the producing area rose instead. The selling price in Shanghai remained at the original price due to poor appetite.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Sees Both Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw tight cash flow at first, and the holders in the market were very willing to sell. The buyers' appetite was flat, so the opening price of 42-count Lanfeng dropped to around 12 million yuan, and the opening price of 20-count Shuangma was 6.7 million yuan. Afterwards, as actual demand came in, it rebounded. The final price of 42-count Lanfeng yarn rebounded to 12.1 million yuan, and the final price of 20-count Shuangma was 6.8 million yuan, which was still 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day for 42-count and 32-count yarn. However, 20-count special Shuangma Jincheng rose by 50,000 to 150,000 yuan. The prices of other 20-count Tiannv Sunlight and other brands and 16-count yarn mostly fell.</p>
<h3>Rationed Flour - Still Difficult to Distribute Today</h3>
<p>[Our report] The distribution of low-priced flour has been slightly delayed due to the back-and-forth of official business between the Social Bureau and the Flour Association, so it is feared that it will still not be possible to distribute it as scheduled today. According to people from the Flour Association: If the official business arrives at the association today, it is hoped that they can contact the Central Trust Bureau and resume distribution within one or two days.</p>
<p>Another report: The municipal authorities plan to adopt the same measures for flour transactions as for rice and edible oil, approving free buying and selling and changing the price negotiation system. They are also preparing to open a flour market and implement open trading, which is currently being planned by the industry association.</p>
<p>Yesterday, flour continued to be allocated to digest stale goods, a sharp drop of 20,000 yuan. Bran fell sharply, with another reduction of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Bean cakes were heavily sold, falling back by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and Yingkou cakes plummeted by more than 10,000 yuan. The oil market had more supply than demand, and the price decline was the most severe. Raw oil and soybean oil plummeted by 40,000, 50,000, or 60,000 yuan, while rapeseed oil and sesame oil also fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and clear oil also fell by slightly less than 40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were very sluggish, and suddenly fell by 20,000 yuan. Few asked about corn, and it plummeted by 20,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed suit and fell by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil plants had acceptable appetite, and the situation was stable. Mung beans had a sluggish appetite and were in a state of fatigue. Sesame seeds moved slightly in foreign firms, with high prices set and secondary products sluggish. Broad beans were flat and stable, and red beans fell back by 20,000 yuan along with other items. Grains fell across the board.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Initially Tight, Then Declines</h3>
<p>The sugar market saw continued tightness yesterday morning, but prices fell uniformly in the afternoon due to certain rumors, with declines ranging from ten thousand to several thousand yuan compared to the previous day. The Guild's market price for Peruvian sugar reached a high of 432,000 yuan, with a midday price of 427,000-428,000 yuan, falling to 420,000 yuan in the afternoon. No. 24 coarse white sugar initially reached 475,000 yuan, falling to 460,000 yuan in the afternoon. Semi-refined white sugar was at 440,000-430,000 yuan. No. 20 medium white sugar was at 395,000-387,000 yuan in the morning, falling to 380,000 yuan in the afternoon. Taiwan red sugar was at 345,000 yuan, later falling to 325,000 yuan.

<h3>Saying the Import Control Will be Revoked, the Import Control Committee Has Not Heard Anything</h3>
<p>Reports that import controls will be lifted and that merchants will be free to import goods have garnered significant attention from all parties. According to Yang Ti, Director of the Secretariat of the Import Control Committee, he has not heard anything about this matter and has no opinion. According to sources, this matter is of great importance and will affect domestic finance, economics, and finance, so the authorities will not act rashly and are studying effective implementation methods. Business people have expressed their hope that the government will take into account the nascent domestic industry and not allow the market to become a dumping ground for American goods.</p>
<h3>Stagnant Tea Exports, Merchants Appeal to All Parties</h3>
<p>The environment for tea, one of our country's main exports, is deteriorating. The reason is that foreign prices have been reduced significantly, making the difference between those prices and the production costs of Chinese tea almost impossible to bridge, resulting in prolonged frozen exports. In particular, most of the aged tea from the 35th year of the Republic remains unsold, and tea merchants, aware that the harvest and production season for new tea this year is approaching, are actively appealing to the authorities for assistance. At the same time, they are sending telegrams overseas, explaining their plight and asking for appropriate concessions on tea prices to revitalize Chinese tea and prevent tea merchants from reaching the brink of ruin. As for domestic tea sales, the local merchants are actively trying to move their goods, and their morale is high. Although sellers are trying to raise prices, the sluggishness of the foreign tea market is preventing them from doing so, resulting in a continued stalemate. However, the market is somewhat firmer than before.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Continue to Decline, Yongtaihe Starts Distributing Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened weakly and continued to decline. Due to Yongtaihe Tobacco Company's large-scale distribution of goods, credit tightened, and there was a lot of reselling in the market. Ten-stick Great Britain brand cigarettes fell to 6.6 million yuan, recovering to 6.675 million yuan at midday. Sales were slightly more active in the afternoon, with the final price at 6.8 million yuan, resulting in a further decline of 150,000 yuan per case compared to the previous day. Old Knife brand cigarettes were stagnant and dropped sharply by 325,000 yuan. Five Flowers brand cigarettes also fell slightly by 140,000 yuan. Prices for other Chinese cigarette brands were also sluggish.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Yongtaihe Tobacco Company is holding a two-tier wholesale distribution for fellow merchants from yesterday until the 29th. Tier A merchants are entitled to 60 boxes of ten-stick "Great Britain Brand" cigarettes at a distribution price of 58,000 yuan per box, 160 boxes of ten-stick "Old Knife Brand" cigarettes at a distribution price of 50,000 yuan per box, 52 cartons of ten-stick "Qianmen Brand" cigarettes at a distribution price of 47,500 yuan per carton, and 52 cartons of twenty-stick "Qianmen Brand" cigarettes at a distribution price of 38,000 yuan per carton.</p>
<p>Tier B merchants are entitled to 40 boxes of ten-stick "Great Britain Brand" cigarettes, 120 boxes of ten-stick "Old Knife Brand" cigarettes, 40 cartons of ten-stick "Qianmen Brand" cigarettes, and 35 cartons of twenty-stick "Qianmen Brand" cigarettes, with distribution prices the same as Tier A.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The hardware market has been consistently sluggish recently, mainly due to limited sales.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Survey Team's Departure, Idle Chat: The Three-Peace Ocean, the Maritime Defense Outpost, Red Head Island</h3>
<p>— Taipei, 24th Dispatch, Our Special Correspondent Mu Yun</p>
<p>Looking at the national map, Red Head Island is just a speck scattered on the eastern sea of Taiwan, a true outpost of maritime defense in the Pacific, like any small bird island in the Bashi Channel among the Tuan Sha, Xisha, and Nansha Islands.</p>
<p>The Japanese had put some effort into this island, and after the restoration, the Taitung County Government renamed the island Orchid Island and established a township office. Because the 49-nautical-mile voyage was difficult to overcome, apart from the aborigines sending people to Taitung by small boats, the county government and even the government tried to send someone there until this spring, when the Communications Department had ships that periodically traveled back and forth between the small islands along the eastern coast. Recently, scientists in Taiwan have become interested in this bird island, and they are trying to confirm the accuracy of the Japanese research with the latest research and surveys. It can be said that researchers from all relevant fields have been gathered to carry out a comprehensive and three-dimensional survey of the island, which should be a major event in the academic world this year.</p>
<p>Red Head Island is Purely an Aboriginal Base</p>
<p>Europeans knew about Red Head Island earlier than we did, around 1726. It is the "Tan Ma Yan" mentioned in the Records of Various Foreign Peoples published in China during the Song Dynasty. The name Red Head Island appeared in the Taiwan Sea Envoy Record by Imperial Censor Huang Shujing of Taiwan in the 61st year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty. Foreigners call it Batel Tabaga, meaning Tobacco Island. The so-called "Red Head" refers to the shape of a Chinese boat with a red head floating on the sea. However, some say that the top of the island is blood-red when viewed from the coast of Taitung on a sunny day; others say that it is because the hair of the island's aborigines is red.</p>
<p>The only characteristic of the island is its purely tropical climate, with little temperature difference throughout the year, a minimum of 20 degrees and a maximum of 36 degrees indoors, and sometimes exceeding 40 degrees outdoors in midsummer. July to October is the typhoon season, with strong winds of 40 meters per second at that time.</p>
<p>From a geographical point of view, it is a monotonous coastline, an aboriginal base formed by underwater volcanoes in the third century, with a plane like a fist that never comes into contact with the outside world and no pier to dock at. Within 45.7 square miles around it, the mountains surrounded by Red Head Mountain (547 meters) in the northwest and Dasen Mountain (440 meters) in the southeast make Red Head Island a unique and primitive area.</p>
<p>The Yamei Tribe Spends Life in Peace</p>
<p>The most precious thing on the island is the Yamei tribe, the most uncivilized tribe in Taiwan. From an anthropological point of view, it is related to Batan Island in the Philippines, and its physique is very similar to the Malay system, with many brown spots similar to those of the African or other races. The Malay eyes have a black iris, and the hair is also black, very similar to the Taiwanese aborigines. But it is also the only backward nation in the world.</p>
<p>The geographical environment determines the conservatism of the Yamei tribe. The attack of foreign enemies is isolated, so that among the 1,600 or 1,700 people of their own tribe, they maintain a peaceful and warless life form, without a ruling chief, without class, and live a primitive individualistic lifestyle under true freedom and true equality. Their social system is very simple, and deep superstition keeps them maintaining their original moral concepts, without the headhunting style of ordinary mountain tribes. People affectionately call them the people of Shangri-La who do not know Qin and Jin, who are right here.</p>
<p>There is no currency system here. The more than 30 currency systems in Shanghai are regarded as waste to them. They adopt the most primitive transaction method—barter. Mainly exchanging iron rods, cloth, salt, matches, soap, and buttons for night pearl shells, seaweed, and aboriginal products. They especially love buttons.</p>
<p>Respecting Women's Rights and Freedom of Divorce</p>
<p>The Yamei tribe is also a nation that does not drink alcohol or smoke, but only likes betel nut. Most of them use sweet potatoes, chestnuts, raw ginger, coconuts, bananas, sugar cane, etc. as food. The seasoning is very simple, only salt. Mountain goats, pigs, and chickens are needed during sacrifices and weddings. They respect women's rights the most. Women can freely divorce. Remarriage is possible three or four times, but it is impossible for men, and they never leave their place of birth for life.</p>
<p>Death is extremely terrifying to them. No one dares to touch it except men. During the funeral, the men are fully armed, solemnly handling the matter, and sending it to the jungle by the sea and burying it in shallow soil.</p>
<p>The entire island only has small walking paths along the coast. They engage in simple agriculture and animal husbandry, raising pigs and goats. Speaking of goats, Little Red Head Island is really a goat pasture. They can be self-sufficient and do not need external supplies.</p>
<p>They live in thatched houses with "three floors", only one floor is exposed, and two floors are under the rocks. The main purpose is to avoid storms, but this sentiment is different from the caves in Yan'an and the Northwest.</p>
<p>They don't wear clothes, everyone is healthy, and it is a safe zone in the world without pulmonary tuberculosis reactions!</p>
<p>Major Threats: Wind, Malignant Red Worms</p>
<p>Red Head Island is marked with the bloody seal of the Japanese conquest. It was on October 4, 1903, when an American ship lost its way and five of them escaped to the island, and their clothes and belongings were looted, which later led to a diplomatic dispute. Subsequently, the Japanese attacked the island on January 27 of the following year, surrounded the aboriginal community, arrested dozens of principals, and removed the houses.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese also established a police station, with three police officers handling matters between the aborigines. There was an aboriginal children's education center, which lured them into school with sweets, sugar, rice, clothes, etc. There is also a weather station. Now, in addition to the weather station being restored as an indicator for measuring fish, the rest are probably not things that can be repaired in a short time.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to the island is typhoons, followed by malignant malaria. The Japanese repeatedly wanted to develop it, but ultimately failed because they could not overcome natural disasters. The Geological Survey sent people to investigate, and three of them sacrificed their lives. There is also the most terrible red worm, commonly known as the red head worm. This worm loves to bite the armpits and lower body. It feels painful after two or three days, and there is a red thorn inside. It will heal if it is taken out. If it is not taken out, it will cause a high fever and endanger life. The Yamei tribe has a unique custom of prevailing in plucking hair. The armpits and genitals are plucked with skillful techniques using stones between the limbs. This is a strange custom, perhaps to overcome the poison of the red head worm!</p>
<p>Two Doctors Launch an Academic Atmosphere</p>
<p>The Red Head Island Survey Team is scheduled to depart from Keelung on the 25th on a 150-ton motorized sailboat. Oceanographer Ma Tingying and medical expert Chen Lijie are responsible for leading more than 50 researchers from various departments to conduct a systematic and classified study of the island for a long period of three weeks, including meteorology. Tropical diseases. Agriculture. Geology. Ocean. Animals and plants. As well as professors and scholars of medicine. Anthropology. Folklore, among whom several are Japanese professors, and one is a German professor Schhwabe who studies the flora and fauna of hot spring areas.</p>
<p>Ma Tingying and Chen Lijie are both doctors who studied in Japan. They both firmly believe that the holding of this survey team, although not a pioneer in the Chinese scientific community, has mobilized 50 or 60 people to collectively go to the desert island to conduct painstaking research for a period of time, but it is still breaking new ground. These workers are tired of politics, especially the chaotic reality. They gather together with common interests and common goals and attack science, hoping to create a new atmosphere in the academic world.</p>
<p>Taiwan has a working environment and conditions suitable for research. For Red Head Island, a zone that cannot be relaxed in terms of national defense and science, it will obviously gain valuable results and improve its international status through the research, investigation, reports, and performances of the group.</p>
<p>"The Pacific Ocean is ours!" They shouted this slogan and took risks to move towards the Red Head Island work area, the forward position of the Pacific National Defense. The reporter here respectfully wishes them a successful return!</p>
<p>When the aborigines take a boat, women and children are absolutely prohibited from approaching, and it is even forbidden to bring any women's supplies, and a respected person must steer the boat. (Sent by our special correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>
<h3>A Wisp of Smoke Increases Tobacco Leaf Production and Cultivates National Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng, 18th Dispatch, Ji Fan</p>
<p>According to statistics for the 35th year of the Republic, the total output of various types of tobacco leaves in our country is about 1.5 billion pounds, while the output of flue-cured tobacco that can be used to manufacture cigarettes is only more than 95 million pounds. According to this calculation, only 600,000 cases of cigarettes can be manufactured. If one-tenth of the country's population smokes cigarettes, each person should maintain each cigarette for 15 hours to be sufficient, which is practically impossible.</p>
<p>According to general estimates, our country needs at least 2 million cases of cigarettes every year, so a large number of finished cigarettes and raw tobacco leaves have to rely on imports, and more than 90% come from the United States. In the 35th year of the Republic, excluding cigarettes, the import of tobacco leaves alone reached 34.8 billion yuan, or about 22 million US dollars. Calculated at today's exchange rate, the average amount of national currency flowing out of the country every minute is 530,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This year, according to the Economic Commission's announced quota for tobacco leaf imports, the first and second phases each last for three months, each at 8 million US dollars, and the average amount of national currency flowing out every minute is 750,000 yuan, and cigarette imports are not included. This wisp of smoke, in an imperceptible moment, has formed one of the biggest loopholes in our country, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Although tobacco is not an absolute necessity of life, it has become an indispensable item in daily life, which is an undeniable fact. Moreover, national tax revenue reached more than 260 billion yuan in the 35th year of the Republic, or 600,000 yuan per minute. It is estimated that it will reach more than 1 trillion yuan this year, or at least 2 million yuan per minute. Therefore, tobacco is also an important source of national tax revenue.</p>
<p>The Tobacco Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in order to increase production, improve quality, eliminate loopholes, and cultivate tax sources, has launched a large-scale tobacco production improvement work. If the situation is stable, it may be possible to achieve self-sufficiency within three years, and it is hoped that there will be a surplus for export to earn foreign exchange. According to the investigation, Henan has the highest output and quality of flue-cured tobacco in our country, followed by Shandong, and then Anhui. This year, because the situation in Shandong is not stable, the work of the Tobacco Production Improvement Department will be carried out in Henan and Anhui provinces first, while only small-scale experiments will be carried out in Qingdao, Shandong, and most of the efforts will be concentrated in Henan. According to preliminary estimates at the beginning of this year, the situation is very good, and the cultivated area can reach about 800,000 mu, an increase of 20% to 30% compared with last year. The future of tobacco production is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Tropical Orchards</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chen Zheng-yu, Fuzhou, 14th Dispatch</p>
<p>The weather is slowly getting warmer, and we will think of eating sweet fruits to quench our thirst. Although Jiangnan is a land of fish and rice, its fruits are ultimately inferior to those of Fujian, which is closer to the tropics. The southeast of Fujian is blessed with a suitable climate and soil, allowing fruits to thrive. The area producing fruit accounts for nearly one-third of the entire province, earning it the name "Tropical Orchard." The variety of fruits and the richness of their production are almost unparalleled by Taiwan and Guangdong. Every year, various fresh fruits or dried fruits are supplied to provinces across the country, amounting to tens of thousands of loads.</p>
<p>Fruit Varieties and Seasons</p>
<p>The fruits produced in Fujian number dozens, among which the most famous are oranges, tangerines, longans, lychees, pomelos, peaches, plums, loquats, bananas, persimmons, star apples, olives, star fruit, jujubes, sugarcane, waxberries, grapes, mangoes, hawthorns, water chestnuts, etc. Some are even rare fruits in the country. These fruits are produced in rotation each year, as seen in the following fruit seasons: January for oranges; February for ripe bananas; March for loquats; April for waxberries to quench thirst; May for peaches and plums all over the land; June for red lychees; July for longan season; August for abundant star apples; September for persimmons to appear; October for fragrant pomelos; November for tangerines heralding winter.</p>
<p>Fuzhou – Fuzhou Tangerines</p>
<p>Among Fujian's fruit exports, Fuzhou tangerines are the most important. Fuzhou tangerines are produced in Fuzhou, Linsen, Fuqing, and other places. They have thin skins, plentiful juice, and are sweet, superior to Shantou tangerines, maintaining their position as the "King of Tangerines." Before the war, the average annual production was 350,000 dan. The best quality ones were transported and sold to Beijing and Shanghai. Tangerines are produced in winter. After the Beginning of Winter, the tangerines are delicate and red, ready to drop. The market appearance of Fuzhou tangerines almost signifies the approaching New Year. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to grain panic in Fuzhou, Fuqing, and other places, farmers were forced to cut down tangerine trees and plant rice, causing the production of tangerines to decline sharply. After November of last year, only nearly 10,000 dan of Fuzhou tangerines were shipped to Shanghai each month. The price per dan ranged from 60,000 to 100,000 yuan. The Sanshan Guild Hall at the 16th Wharf in Shanghai is the trading place for the export of Fuzhou tangerines. Besides being eaten fresh, the peel of the tangerine is removed with a knife, dried in the sun, and called "Tangerine Peel," which has an extremely fragrant and sweet taste. Shanghai Daoxiangcun uses it to make medicine.</p>
<p>Longan and Lychee</p>
<p>Putian is abundant in lychees and longans, hence the name "Lychee City." There is a popular saying, "Pick ten thousand longans, eat three hundred lychees," expressing a grand enjoyment. Putian's lychee varieties are excellent. Although Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou also produce lychees, their quality is much inferior. This tree is an evergreen tree, as tall as twenty or thirty feet, with a crown like a canopy. The leaves are pinnately compound. It bears fruit in June. This fruit fears frost and snow, and is only suitable for planting in subtropical or tropical regions. If a west wind rises during flowering, it will be difficult to bear fruit, and it is especially sensitive to musk, which will cause all the flowers and fruits to fall. Lychees are not suitable for long-distance travel because they are easily perishable. The people of Putian make them into dried lychees, commonly known as Yuanxiang, which are transported and sold to Jiangnan and North China. Before the war, the average annual production was 30,000 dan. If calculated at the current price of 1,000 yuan per catty, it is worth 300,000,000 yuan. However, in the year after the victory, the production declined sharply, with only more than 4,000 dan produced, causing lychee drying merchants to suffer heavy losses.</p>
<p>Zhangzhou – Wentan Pomelos</p>
<p>Pomelos are also evergreen trees, taller than tangerines, suitable for planting in malarial areas. Zhangzhou produces the most, followed by Xiamen. Zhangzhou's pomelos have thin skins, sweet flesh, and plentiful juice, worthy of being called the best in the world. The larger ones are called "Pengshan," and the smaller ones are called "Wentan," enjoying great fame and selling in the province and in Nanyang and Hong Kong. In the past, women in southern Fujian used a planing knife to take down the pomelo wood from the pomelo tree to use as hair gel, commonly known as "Beauty Gel," which is a celebrated tale.</p>
<p>Others include the oranges of Fuzhou and Lianjiang, which are currently being planted in large quantities; the olives of Linsen, which are crisp when bitten and transported and sold to Jiangnan; the Kun peaches of Fuzhou, which are of excellent quality; the plums of various counties in eastern Fujian, made into "Li-gan," transported and sold at home and abroad, called "Jiayingzi" by Hong Kong people; the persimmons produced in Linsen, Yongtai, and other counties, besides being eaten fresh, are made into persimmon balls and persimmon cakes, peddled and sold in various places; the black jujubes, loquats, water chestnuts, sugarcane, and other fruits of various counties in southeastern Fujian were all exported before the war, with an annual value of more than one million yuan.</p>
<p>An Orchard</p>
<p>Fruit is one of the main sideline products of the rural areas of Fujian Province. Farmers plant fruit trees during their leisure time to supplement their insufficient income from farm work. Planting fruit requires changing soil and fertilizing every year to be successful. There are prosperous and lean years for fruit production, alternating with each other. Judging from the desolate fruit production situation in Fujian last year, this year's fruit production in Fujian should be a prosperous year. However, the rural economy has been suffocated recently, and most farmers do not have the ability to buy new seedlings and fertilizers to propagate their orchards, and there are concerns about insect pests, which greatly damage the benefits of fruit production. What can farmers do? In the southeastern part of Fujian, during the Anti-Japanese War, because the area was a coastal hub, 80-90% of the transportation routes were destroyed, resulting in fruit products in the fruit areas of Xianyou, Putian, Fuqing, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and other places being all over the ground, unable to be transported out in large quantities, left to rot, and goods discarded on the ground, which is very regrettable. If problems such as transportation, refrigeration, and fertilizers can be solved, Fujian can indeed become the number one orchard in the country.</p>
<h3>Regarding Chinese Naval Students in the UK</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read a communication from Chinese naval students in the UK on page 7 of your May 11th issue, and its content is quite accurate, being largely the same as what my younger brother reported in his letter last spring. My younger brother left Chongqing for India and then transferred to the UK in November of the 34th year (of the Republic), as one of the first group of fifty officers. He is currently training at the Royal Naval Gunnery School in Chatham, near London. Once he has completed his studies, he will serve as a gunnery instructor for the second group of students who arrived in England this spring. He is expected to sail back to China on the "Zhendan" ship this summer. According to his understanding, the names of the ships should be corrected as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Renown ("Reputation") 35,000 tons, 6 15-inch guns, is one of the three British battlecruisers. Another, the Hood, was sunk in the Atlantic by the German ship "Bismarck." Another, the Repulse ("Resistance"), was sunk in Singapore by Japanese aircraft. The "Name Accurate" ship has been decommissioned and is used exclusively for naval training, and is not the "Adventure" aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>(2) Aurora ("Dawn") is the original name. It was renamed "Zhendan" after being given to our country, and is a light cruiser of 5,720 tons. (The following omitted) Respectfully, Gao Guangyu (May 12, Kunming)</p>

<p>To the Editor: At noon on the 17th of this month, a young man dressed in work clothes and carrying electrical repair tools claimed to be sent by an electrical supply store to repair the meter, and directly entered the third floor of No. 51, Tengfeng Lane, Sichuan Middle Road, my residence. At that time, it was the meal preparation time for the entire building, and the tenants refused because there was no problem with the lights on the third floor. He then returned to the second floor and stole the sub-meter prepared by the tenant and fled without a trace. Because the sub-meters of the second-floor tenants were installed at the door of the rooms, and it happened that no one was entering or leaving the household, it was stolen, it is estimated that it was worth about 400,000 yuan at the time. I am deeply afraid that after the scoundrel succeeds once, he will inevitably use his skills on a large scale in the future. Upon investigation, most of the companies, landlords, and firms in Tengfeng Lane have strict rules, yet it still happened. Other lanes are even more unthinkable. I hope that the relevant authorities will pay close attention and hope that citizens will be vigilant at all times to avoid losses. (Jun Ran)</p>
<p>At the end of Alley 934 (Moufuli), Tanggu Road, Beizhan District, garbage is piled up like a mound, and it is littered all over the place, but it has not been cleared. As summer approaches, the sunlight steams it, and the foul smell is rampant, mosquitoes and flies breed, and it is a source of germs, which has a great impact on health. It is hoped that the health authorities will clear it up urgently. In addition, the lid of the trash can is damaged, and it is hoped that the authorities will move this can to a suitable place in the alley. This is especially what I hope for. (Ge Airen)</p>
<h3>Yixing Hospital is Too Short of Medicine</h3>
<p>I am a small civil servant. Since I returned to Yixing to visit relatives on May 6th last year, who knew that at noon on the 8th, my seven-year-old child suddenly developed a fever when he returned home from school. A child's fever is not a serious matter, so I gave him some anti-inflammatory tablets and told him to sleep. He didn't moan at the time, but the fever was very high at night. On the morning of the 9th, I took him to Yixing Public Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, he had scarlet fever and needed to inject scarlet fever serum, but the hospital did not have this medicine in stock and told me to buy it myself. Who knew that I ran all over Yixing City and private Western medicine clinics, but there was no such medicine. The car to Wuxi had already left, and it would take two days to take a boat, so I decided to take a bus to Wuxi for treatment the next day. In the afternoon, my child's condition worsened, his eyes rolled upward, and he had convulsions. In my anxious state, I asked a neighbor to find a traditional medicine practitioner to give him acupuncture, but the practitioner just shook his head and said there was nothing he could do. I had no choice but to send him to the Public Hospital again and ask the director to find a way to rescue him, injecting penicillin and cardiotonics, but it was ultimately ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 8 pm that afternoon. I checked the cause of my child's death, and it was not because the disease could not be cured, but because Yixing did not have the medicine to treat him. If Yixing Public Hospital had the scarlet fever serum, why would my child die? It is heartbreaking that such a fat and healthy child died in one and a half days. My child's death is not a pity, but the lack of medicine in Yixing Public Hospital is such that how can tens of thousands of children in Yixing be rescued if they get an infectious disease? Are we just waiting to die? This is a big problem. Children are the future masters of the country, and we can no longer spoil their little lives. I want to appeal for all the children in Yixing, asking the kind-hearted philanthropists among my fellow villagers in Shanghai to donate some special medicines for infectious diseases, such as scarlet fever serum, meningitis serum, diphtheria and other medicines, to Yixing Public Hospital, in order to benefit the people. At the same time, I hope that the responsible person in the hospital will also prepare these medicines. In short, my child was sacrificed because of lack of medicine. I don't want other children to suffer the same unfortunate fate as my child, so I can only appeal with tears and pain on behalf of the tens of thousands of children in Yixing! I also hope that hospitals in other second-class cities will also strive to be well-equipped! (Wu Jusheng)</p>
<h3>There are Nails in the Trees in Zhongshan Park</h3>
<p>To the Editor: There are many cedar trees to the west of the Fanshi Pavilion in Zhongshan Park. The park manager has densely nailed iron nails to the trees because children climb the trees. This kind of method that is invisible to the eye and hurts when touched, I urgently hope that the Public Works Bureau will find a way to improve it, and please pay attention to the parents of children in this city, in case of accidental contact, not only will it be a thorn injury, but there is also a danger of falling. Even in terms of trees, it is also feared that it will easily lead to withering. (Qian Nengxun)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Climate of Spring</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>Secretary Wu ran out of his house, and seeing the sun was already high, he knew it was late, so he quickened his pace.</p>
<p>His body was quite thin and weak, with his two shoulders appearing high. He probably hunched over his desk writing for too long. He had a flat head, and wore an old woolen hat, making him look like a scarecrow. That thin, long stalk—his neck—swayed, making people worry it would break.</p>
<p>He wore a black cotton robe, and the sleeves, collar, and hem of the robe were frayed. The bottom of the sleeves and the seat of the pants were shiny, like a clock face. There were two seams in the middle of the robe, because the robe was too short, and cloth was specially added to lengthen it. Wide borders were sewn on both sides because the robe was too small, and cloth was specially added to expand both sides.</p>
<p>The March sun shone on his body, making him feel warm, and he had walked a long way quickly, so beads of sweat crept stealthily into his vest and on his cheeks.</p>
<p>"It's warm, I can't wear the cotton robe anymore!" As soon as he thought this, his pace couldn't help but slow down. He was concerned that the pedestrians on the road had all taken off their winter clothes, and the cotton robe had become a rare thing.</p>
<p>The more he walked, the more he felt that what he was carrying on his body was not a cotton robe, but a wooden yoke. As long as someone on the road glanced at him, he always felt that the gaze cast was a mocking and contemptuous look.</p>
<p>Three modern women walked towards him. They were all wearing short spring clothes, and one of them even exposed her fat arms. The three of them walked side by side. In Secretary Wu's eyes, they were simply three powerful armies, coming to confront him. He didn't have the courage to move forward, and his feet hesitated.</p>
<p>As they approached him, Secretary Wu was in a hurry to give way, and a burst of panic caused his body to sway from side to side involuntarily, causing the three women to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"They're laughing at me, they're laughing at me, they must be laughing at my clothes..." He muttered to himself, and his cheeks were already burning.</p>
<p>He ran into the office panting, and saw that many colleagues had changed their clothes. Especially the "office flower" sitting by the window—a female comrade—was only wearing a thin, bright red lined robe today, with her chest held high.</p>
<p>He took off his old woolen hat, wiped away a handful of sweat, and sat down with his head buried, pulled out a small writing brush, and prepared to copy official documents, but his whole body was on fire, and his heart couldn't be quiet no matter what. The beads of sweat on his forehead dripped directly onto the official document paper. The black words on the official document all changed…clothes…spring…three women…red lined robe…and other words, jumped into his eyes.</p>
<p>"Hey, Comrade Wu, do you want to make a uniform?" The office flower walked up to him and put a notice soliciting the making of uniforms and a piece of woolen sample in front of him: "It's very cheap, 300,000 to make a set of uniforms. Big staff members can pay it back in two months, and small staff members in three months..."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! Let me take a look!" He picked up the notice and the woolen sample and looked at them back and forth for a while. The office flower was impatient and retreated back to her window seat.</p>
<p>——My monthly salary is only 140,000. After deducting 100,000 each month, I only have 40,000 left. Can this 40,000 yuan cover the family's expenses?</p>
<p>——If I don't make it, then I'll never be able to make it!</p>
<p>He thought and thought, thought for a long time, but still couldn't decide. He kept rubbing his scalp with the penholder, and a lot of dandruff fell down.</p>
<p>In the end, he returned the notice to the office flower.</p>
<p>"How is it?" the office flower asked, opening her bright eyes and glancing at his black cotton robe.</p>
<p>"I... I'll consider it again..." He stammered these words and twisted his thin neck.</p>
<p>"I know, old Wu is afraid of his wife. He must go back and submit it to his wife for approval!" A colleague next to him deliberately teased him.</p>
<p>He smiled miserably and returned to his seat.</p>
<p>Whenever the seasons changed, it was almost always a time that made him anxious.</p>
<p>Because the season changed, the climate also changed, and the clothes he wore had to change as well.</p>
<p>But he was just a small secretary, and the salary he received each month was used to support his wife, daughter, and himself. Filling the three stomachs was already very difficult, so where would there be extra money to make clothes?</p>
<p>There was no way, he could only rely on this black cloth robe, passing through four autumns, four winters, and three springs.</p>
<p>Every time the seasons were about to change, he would always have a hope: I must change my clothes next season, but hope and reality were out of sync. In fact, this black robe seemed to have formed an inextricable bond with him, unwilling to leave him.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he hated this robe very much, and even cursed it. On the other hand, it was, after all, a long robe. To continue mixing in the "long robe team," he still had to cherish it.</p>
<p>"The mouse has a layer of skin, and I have a black coat. If my black coat gets a hole torn on a nail, then I won't be able to mix in!" He had thought this way.</p>
<p>Sometimes he envied those coolies: "They are so good, wearing short clothes, it doesn't matter if they are a little tattered! What's the use of long robes?"</p>
<p>Although that's what he said, he couldn't run into the office wearing short shirts and trousers after all.</p>
<p>Now, the weather is getting warmer day by day, and people mostly welcome the spring season with smiling faces. Only he, his heart is more and more depressed every day.</p>
<p>This season, he still can't make new clothes. He is still wearing this black robe, preparing to spend the fourth spring, but the cotton inside has been removed, and the cotton robe has become a lined robe.</p>
<p>The climate in spring is changeable. One night, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the weather suddenly turned cold. Secretary Wu didn't have time to put the cotton back into his robe. He reluctantly resisted the cold, but after resisting for two days, he fell ill.</p>
<h3>Friendship – Postscript to "Freedom Talk Monthly"</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Teaching, writing, and editing magazines seem to be what I like to do from the bottom of my heart. Perhaps it stems from a quest for emotional resonance in friendship, but I feel lonely when I leave it. "Night Talk" was only edited for three months and was discontinued for some reason. A year has passed, loneliness has invaded me, mingling in the circles of car dust and coal smoke, whiling away the time, without knowing why.</p>
<p>This was a chance encounter. A friend wanted to start a magazine, and I surprisingly agreed. Chance became the main reason for "surprisingly", but I just wanted to throw my empty heart, which had been lonely for a long time, back into the warm stove of friendship. But I have to run around for a living during the day. I didn't want to spoil the fun. When the setting sun slanted over the river, or when dusk shrouded the treetops, I could still find the edification of friendship. In this way, "Freedom Talk" was produced.</p>
<p>It can also be said that I should mark an unforgettable page in the short course of my few dozen years of life, because in this world only friendship is warm, warm and even great. During this period, in addition to the natural help of several old friends such as Zhao Jingshen, Wei Jinzhi, Hu Shanyuan, Qian Juntao, and Chen Bochui, and the words "Inside the summary, Mount Sumeru mustard seeds, pen flying rain, wind thunder" inscribed by Ye Xiaweng, Zikai sent a special draft from Hangzhou. New friendship gave me unparalleled encouragement, and the casual chats during the draft pulling process seem worth recording.</p>
<p>First of all, I thought of Shi Zhecun. Zhecun and I are spiritual friends. He has unique creations in both new and old literature. When he was transferred to the inland, he wrote many old poems, and so did I. During these eight years of departing from sorrow and depression, I compiled "A Speck of Dust" and sent it to him to read. At that time, he was about to go to Xuzhou to finish the unfinished classes of Jiangsu College. He wrote to me saying that the "Ode to Rolling Back the Soil" "directly extracted the essence of Jiangxi," which I dare not accept, but I have always treasured the Xuan paper note he used, with its strong and unrestrained ink treasure. Because the yellow fragrance was already deep, I first went to his Jinan dormitory. In the faint light, he pulled out many poems for me to read, one by one. The paper for writing poems was specially prepared, as if it had the sign of "Wu Xiang Temple." A few days later, I received his manuscript, which was "Notes from Wu Xiang Temple," about poetry criticism. He said that next he would write lyrics, or songs, and wanted to have a systematic discussion of this kind. Next, I met Dai Wangshu. Wangshu was as heroic and unrestrained as Zhecun when talking about the sky, and so amiable. He was teaching at both Jinan and Normal College, which was very tedious, but he definitely agreed to help. He knew about my work during the day and strangely said, "How did you step into such a circle?" Yes, I am whiling away my time in a circle full of commercial atmosphere, so I feel lonely and want to pick up my pen again. I responded with a smile as usual, but this answer was not spoken.</p>
<p>Shanghai rarely sees Xie Bingying's articles. I wanted her to write some news. Before receiving her Beijing news "This is Not Spring", she replied that she would definitely write to me. With just this sentence, I felt deeply happy, because she was editing several publications and had to teach, so she was really too busy. "This is Not Spring" also mentioned "Qingge asked her if she wanted to return to Shanghai." Ms. Zhao Qingge was burying her head in writing a novel and had stopped contributing to external publications for a long time. She was also kind enough to rush a piece for me. When I was sitting upstairs reading Xiao Tianhan's poem, I really wanted to write one as well, but I only remembered the rhyme "Qingge is as agile as a strong man".</p>
<p>Soon, although the drafts were almost ready, other difficulties arose. Although "Freedom Talk" was published, my heart still sank, returning to loneliness. I was afraid of failing the warmth of friendship in vain.</p>
<h3>Father of Modern Drama - Ibsen</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906), the father of modern drama, had his 41st death anniversary on May 23rd of this year. The brilliance of this solitary pioneer's thought still shines brightly before our eyes today.</p>
<p>Ibsen was Norwegian, but he spent more of his life in exile in foreign lands. It was not until his old age, when he turned seventy, that he received a warm welcome from his compatriots, which moved the old man so much that he smiled through his tears. Indeed, Ibsen was a pioneer of his time. He opposed all the corruption and deceit of the established society and championed freedom and truth. He personally declared war on unreasonable laws, morals, religion, and marriage. Throughout his life, his plays prioritized expressing his thoughts. He fought, continued to move forward, and never retreated. The stubbornness of society continued its vulgar attacks. He wanted to heal this sick society and create healthy descendants for the future. His works are absolutely devoted to humanity, freedom, and happiness, and he is truly a pioneer of free thought in Europe!</p>
<p>Originally, a prophet is always initially rejected by the masses, even considered a rebel. Later, when society decays to the point of collapse and needs to be rebuilt, this rebel is often welcomed as a deity. Therefore, one of the reasons Ibsen's thought leaned towards individualism was because he sensitively saw the impending collapse of the old society and pointed out its source of disease. Unfortunately, people at the time were accustomed to established etiquette and instead accused him of heresy. As a result, he produced the extremely individualistic heroic theories that "the most powerful person in the world is the most lonely person" and "the minority party is often right, and the majority party is often wrong," which seem to be anti-democratic. In fact, his arguments were precisely to debate against the blind attacks of society at the time. And this "individual" must be a prophet, and the so-called "majority" must refer to the ignorant masses. He felt that the masses of society at the time were blindly following, and his personal insights were not accepted by the masses. Individual will, freedom, and happiness were all obscured and corroded by hypocrisy and vulgar deceit. Therefore, he developed free thought.</p>
<p>His four major social problem plays pioneered realistic drama! "A Doll's House" is a famous work that shook the world for women's rights, but because society counterattacked him, he wrote "Ghosts" to answer. As society attacked him even more, he wrote "An Enemy of the People" to answer again. When society resisted him even more intensely, he finally wrote "The Wild Duck," saying, "Don't expose hypocrisy, or your happiness will also be destroyed at the same time." But the facts tell people: "Life is like flowing water, its meaning and value lie in rushing forward mightily. The wild duck of the open sky, once hit, sinks to the bottom and never rises again;—the one raised in the back building, washing in the water in the trough, is content and forgets its origins, alas!" This is a great satire on people who are content with hypocrisy and deceit and forget freedom and happiness!</p>
<p>Ibsen's life was one of struggle. Due to the stimulation of the objective environment and the stubbornness of his inner personality, he fulfilled his great will to seek human happiness through resistance. Although he is the father of realistic drama, his early and late works still have romantic overtones because he praised nature, pursued truth, and advocated individuality and personality. Therefore, commemorating the master of modern drama, Ibsen, in such a hypocritical and chaotic society still has great significance!</p>
<h3>The Wall</h3>
<p>— Zang Zan</p>
<p>A bird's home is a high rock standing in the sky, a treetop dissolving into the sky, or a bird rack hanging in the air. Only smaller birds raised by people live in cages, but they still get sunlight and breathe air. But what about people? People live in houses surrounded by high walls and walk on roads between walls.</p>
<p>One day, my friend and I went to the city to buy a train ticket because he was leaving the city for the north the next day. After buying the ticket, we took one last tour of the streets until dark (my friend and I had not been in this city for long, and now he was leaving again. There were new encounters and new hopes everywhere. I couldn't leave here with him, and of course, I couldn't keep him here). We tried to find roads that we didn't usually take, and the darker we walked.</p>
<p>Like dark clouds setting off lightning; lights setting off the night. In the night, what was clear became unclear, what was ugly became beautiful, and what was old became fresh. We wandered through the blind man's qin music, the lights of the small food stalls, and the storytellers and singers... We forgot the time until midnight.</p>
<p>— Perhaps not midnight — until we lost our way.</p>
<p>The colder and lonelier we walked, the closer we came to a high wall, tall and long, with no end in sight. We walked far away from the wall, the wall exuding a terrible chill, as if it could fall down at any moment—no one believed that such a high wall could last. But we couldn't deny that this was a new encounter. Was it a rich man locking himself inside? But why didn't he even build a door or window? (Just a wall.) And why was it made so high? After circling the high wall a few times, we finally found a door—like a city gate, with words written on it:</p>
<p>"Prison"</p>
<p>In front of this dark gate, without hesitation, we immediately found an alley across the street and slipped in, not daring to make a sound.</p>
<p>As if walking into a nightmare, everything around us had been arranged by demons. Walking out of this unknown alley, there was another high wall, another gloomy gate, with a bright light on the door, white and green. An armed soldier stood upright in the bright light, another prison:</p>
<p>"Military Prison"</p>
<p>We no longer had the courage to go forward; not only were we afraid of running into prison, but we were also afraid that my friend wouldn't be able to get up early for his departure tomorrow. We asked the first passerby we met, and he told us the way home—it was still an unfamiliar road. We walked with our heads down, not speaking, just thinking, and knowing that we were both thinking about the same thing, wanting to find something to say, but afraid of disturbing each other's thoughts.</p>
<p>Ahead was another row of high walls, this wall was older and more empty, as if inside was just a wilderness, where even small grass could hardly grow, a wilderness that would never be exposed to sunlight... But we did hear sounds inside, like wind, like sighs—but not like a single person's sigh, but the sighs of thousands of people; low and numerous. We looked for the words on the gate, which were written in gold on a blood-red background:</p>
<p>"Seminary"</p>
<p>Ah! That was not a sigh, that was not the sound of the wind, it was the sound of praise, the sound of bells. The sigh was our own.</p>
<p>We kept walking, it was probably past midnight, and we walked to the road we knew. Along the way, we encountered many similar high walls, some were residences, some were temples, and some were still prisons.</p>
<p>The road home was long and required crossing a large meadow. Fortunately, it was a familiar road. In the field, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The first sentence, my friend said:</p>
<p>"It's all walls, all walls."</p>
<p>I was sad. I felt lonely. Tomorrow, my friend would take the train and then the ship to the ocean.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 520</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"What kind of 'morality' is that... In other words, isn't China misled by this kind of morality?" Tsurumi spoke with the eyes of a Japanese 'military nationalist' education.</p>
<p>"If you say that, I have to ask a question: Who gave you the right to kill... whether it's an individual or a country?"</p>
<p>"For individuals, of course, there are national laws to exercise power..."</p>
<p>"Then, for countries, there are also international laws to exercise power,... But who established international law?... Now who is diligently abiding by international law? Who has recognized the existence of international arbitration, except under false pretenses?"</p>
<p>"That's right, so we need to manufacture weapons to strike weapons, and use war to quell war!" Tsurumi used Japanese militaristic aggression and sophistry to thwart Shouyi's theory. "You alone want to uphold justice with empty hands, but in today's world, we have reached the era of military power first, and might makes right. You alone stubbornly adhere to the 'no interaction until death' approach of the pre-Christian era, acting as a state of etiquette. To put it nicely, you are performing the role of a 'martyr'; in fact, you are inviting others to invade, simply waiting to become a subjugated people!"</p>
<p>"Do you think that going so slowly, step by step, turtle-like, ox-like, can keep up with the times?" In Tsurumi's imagination, he seemed to see the Japanese army sweeping over like a dark cloud, about to turn China into a mess. Korea further away, the Northeast closer, and even closer, North China after the Lugouqiao Incident, are examples.</p>
<p>"Even if it's too late, we have to do it this way... Mencius said: 'If a disease of seven years is to be cured with artemisia of three years, unless it is accumulated, it will never be obtained in a lifetime.' You must know that the stages of culture must naturally be taken step by step. You can only choose to take the fastest path, but you cannot distort, skip, or cross. Little Japan has made this mistake of distortion and crossing. Do you think that a savage nation, bare-chested, with a brain full of cannibalistic ideas, can be considered a civilized nation just by putting on a Western-style tuxedo? Should they invade others?..."</p>
<p>"Practicing martial arts is also the same: you must start from the basics, first strengthen your internal organs before you can train your muscles and skin. According to you saying 'it's too late,' it seems that you should first learn a few killer moves... Of course, you can learn them successfully; once you fight, you may be able to knock someone down immediately, but your own internal organs will also be greatly injured, even fatally. In case you can't knock someone down with one blow, it will be even worse..."</p>
<p>"Shh!"...</p>
<p>While Shouyi was driving and talking, he was also paying attention to the situation along the road. At this time, he suddenly heard a sharp whistle from the roadside, knowing that it was the signal of his own people, and knowing that he was close to Hongzhen, he slowed down the speed of the car, and also made a "shh" sound to release the signal.</p>
<p>As soon as this signal was released, he immediately heard "shh... shh..." two responses not far ahead. This response indicates that he has reached the warning range. Shouyi heard this signal and immediately braked the car; because the area was deserted and it was late, there were no pedestrians coming and going, so he turned the car around on the road and parked it by the roadside. Just as he was about to greet Tsurumi to get out of the car, he suddenly caught a glimpse of shadows shaking under the eaves in front.</p>
<h3>Ibsen's Debut Work</h3>
<p>— Li Shimin</p>
<p>Henrik Ibsen started working as an apprentice in a pharmacy at the age of fourteen. In 1848, Europe was in the midst of a surge of revolutionary thought, and the young Ibsen, only twenty years old, admired this kind of thinking very much. In order to praise the revolution, he decided to engage in creation. Therefore, every night he wrote manuscripts by candlelight until late at night before stopping writing. After two years of work, he completed his debut three-act tragic poem—"Catilina." In 1851, with a heart to become an artist, he left the life of a ten-year ink slave and stepped out of the pharmacy. After that, he first entrusted the book "Catilina" to a friend to publish anonymously at his own expense. But after publication, only more than thirty copies were sold.</p>
<h3>Mei Lan</h3>
<p>— Chen Congzhou</p>
<h3>Random Talk in Solitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>When I was a child, when I was still in elementary school.</p>
<p>Quite by chance, I came across two lines of poetry in the Investiture of the Gods. These fourteen characters were deeply imprinted in my mind. The poem says: "I originally entrusted my heart to the bright moon, who knew the bright moon would shine on the gutter."</p>
<p>To this day, I still can't remember what kind of remarkable sorrow I had at the time? At a young age, I was deeply aware of the vicissitudes of human life.</p>
<p>I think those who love to think deeply must be sentimental. And in this bizarre human world, there are many problems that cannot be solved, nor need to be solved.</p>
<p>Ugly reality cannot accommodate solemn thoughts; how far the life of carnal desire throws the activities of the soul.</p>
<p>The childhood living environment can often give people different imaginations. For example, Mussolini was the son of a blacksmith. The blacksmith's workshop became his imagination. He once said to Ludwig: "The anvil and fire inspired me with a passion to cast things according to my own will."</p>
<p>I think the reason why this demon king is a demon king may be because he lacks philosophical concepts like Kant to guide his passion.</p>
<p>Passion is like fire, it should be used properly.</p>
<p>Don't reject words because of the person.</p>
<p>The Devil also has a rather moving story:</p>
<p>"One night, the old man was burning in the fire, and he saw a family enjoying a rich dinner peacefully in the garden of a hotel by Lake Geneva. He was surprised that he actually had a begging thought, and resolutely ran away, although he didn't have a penny at the time. At this time, he wrote a very moving letter to his friend: "I have given up all memories, even ideals."</p>
<p>Later, recalling the past, he looked at the distance sadly, and he said to a foreign friend: "Hunger is a good teacher, almost as good as an enemy... As a socialist, the future is open to me. Prison is a good school, prison is like the sea. People can learn patience at sea."</p>
<p>So he listed the eleven prisons he had entered in four countries, and called them a rare place to exercise his body.</p>

<h3>Chaplin's Satire</h3>
<p>— Xu Dan</p>
<p>Chaplin's new film "Monsieur Verdoux" has recently been released in the United States, and will probably be shipped to China soon. "Reader's Digest" issue 151 has a detailed introduction to this film. In this film, Chaplin reversed his past comedic style, but paid special attention to the portrayal of characters' personalities and tried his best to emphasize satirical scenes of reality. What I am interested in in "Monsieur Verdoux" is because I was reminded of the famous "Shen Wuye" in the "Man-Demon Case" from Chaplin's satire.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Monsieur Verdoux?</p>
<p>According to the introduction of "Reader's Digest," we can know that he is a middle-aged French bank clerk who lost his job in an economic depression. He loves his wife and children very much, but in an economically paralyzed state, he cannot find a job to ensure their safety, so he found a way out for himself: to be a murderer. The targets of his sacrifice are foolish and wealthy women. His work is not easy, he pursues them, marries them, and then murders them. Although this kind of work is disgusting, he also gets some pleasure from it. Every time he completes a "money-making" job, he returns to his lovely home to relax until the bread problem forces him to come out and do the killing again.</p>
<p>This is a person who has not completely lost his "humanity," very much like Balzac's great thief "Vautrin." The latter did not want to do the crime of murder, but in a society like Paris where "those who steal a country become nobles, those who steal a hook are punished," he finally took theft as his lifelong career.</p>
<p>A kind person, a strong person, a person who has not completely lost his mind, when he discovers the unreasonableness of the money-worshiping society, wants to survive, but does not know how to get bread; has hatred, but cannot see the target of hatred, and does not know how to vent his anger. In this situation, he may naturally attack the weak or the foolish. Is Monsieur Verdoux Chaplin's fantasy character? No, although Chaplin exaggerated Monsieur Verdoux's personality, there is still a realistic basis after all, otherwise, the starting point of this satirical film would be too illusory, what is there to talk about satire?</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Associated Press of America reported a dramatic murder news, in which the behavior of the protagonist, brewer Harris, had the style of Monsieur Verdoux. Harris killed another girl, Pansy, in a chance encounter because his girlfriend broke the appointment. Indeed, he had his motive for revenge, but he actually chose an innocent victim to start with, which was really beyond the expectations of ordinary people.</p>
<p>If you don't see the target clearly and take revenge randomly, you may inevitably make a big joke. Monsieur Verdoux's pity is not in his revenge doctrine, but in the fact that he became a "murderer" but still tried his best to maintain his "conscience."</p>
<p>"Shen Wuye" may also be a revenge doctrine. She was first a concubine of a certain celebrity, then abandoned, and then appeared in men's clothing, and also collected many concubines of wealthy families. It seems that how others played with her at the beginning, now she also plays with them.</p>
<p>This is just my speculation, "Shen Wuye" may not be willing to admit it, but after reading the review of Chaplin's film in "Reader's Digest," I naturally had this association.</p>
<h3>What's It To You?</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Girl A: I have a toothache.</p>
<p>Girl B: If I were you, I would definitely find a dentist to pull it out.</p>
<p>Girl A: If this were your tooth, I would have pulled it out long ago.</p>
<h3>Telephone Operator</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Man A: Your girlfriend must have been a telephone operator before.</p>
<p>Man B: How do you know?</p>
<p>Man A: You say ten sentences and she won't answer you ten sentences.</p>

<h3>Reading Mr. Feng Zikai's "Remembering Master Taixu"</h3>
<p>— Huang Hua</p>
<p>Before Master Taixu passed away, society can be said to have mixed praise and criticism for him; countless people worshiped him wholeheartedly; but there were also many who misunderstood him, suspected him, and even slandered him and framed him; the author is one of those who once misunderstood him. I remember around the tenth year of the Republic of China, when I was the chief writer at the Shibao Hall hosted by Mr. Di Chuqing, the senior poet Mr. Chen Ziyan once included several of my five-character poems in his book "Zunzhaishi Poetry Talk" and published them in the Shibao's supplementary literary weekly. Later, the Haichaoyin magazine hosted by Master Taixu reprinted these poems. I was very unhappy when I saw this issue of Haichaoyin, and wrote two sentences on its cover, saying: How can the mouthpiece of a political monk reprint my poems? From this point, you can imagine my concept of Master Taixu at that time.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Master Taixu's chariot was in the lower courtyard of a certain temple in Shanghai. A Buddhist friend invited me to see him together. At that time, my concept of Master Taixu had gradually changed, because I had corresponded with him once and found him to be kind and amiable. But I still said to that friend: Is Master Taixu like ordinary old masters, wanting people to kowtow and worship? He said, no! no! Master Taixu is very easy-going. So I went with him, and after meeting him, my feelings can be said to be the same as those of Mr. Feng Zikai. From then on, I followed Master Taixu for more than twenty years, until he passed away.</p>
<p>Master Taixu's wisdom is truly unparalleled in the world. He is proficient in both worldly and otherworldly methods. No matter what question you ask, he has an appropriate answer. No matter what you do, he has careful planning.</p>
<p>Master Taixu is the culmination of Buddhist studies. His attainments are above Zhizhen Fazang, and his theories are more complete than theirs. He is indeed the one who understands Buddhism most correctly and obtains the true essence of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Master Taixu's compassion is also unprecedented. He can be said to be the embodiment of causeless compassion, all of which is compassion, like fire is all heat. The great Buddhism takes great compassion to save the world as its foundation. When it comes to saving the world, it cannot be isolated from the world. If you leave the world, it is like leaving the well to save the people inside the well. How can you save them? Master Taixu's involvement in politics and society is the manifestation of his great compassion. It is a pity that there are too many shallow-minded people in society.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng said, "How could Chongde produce such a person?" Let me say further: How could the modern world—especially China—produce such a person?</p>
<p>Recently, I have a poem "Reading Master Taixu's Posthumous Poems," which is now attached here for Mr. Feng and the general readers to give their opinions: "Compassion and wisdom are empty for thousands of years, a great master of humans and gods, practicing the Bodhisattva path, until the time of Nirvana, how eager is the heart to protect the teachings, how can the world know the lonely mind, come again and leave a great wish, wiping away tears to read the posthumous poems."</p>
<h3>Two Chapters of Reminiscence</h3>
<p>— Ning Po</p>
<p>In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Russo-Japanese War broke out in Chinese territory. Russia was defeated, and after the war ended, Japan verbally said that it would withdraw its troops, but the army was still stationed all over Manchuria and had no intention of retreating. At that time, Mr. Zhao Erxun was the General of Shengjing. Only Japanese Prime Minister Saionji came to Shenyang to inspect. Zhao knew that the Japanese warlords and political leaders had different opinions, and also knew that Saionji had an authoritative position as a "gentle faction." So he deliberately held a celebration and wrote two poems to him. The last two sentences of the first poem: "Old and rustic, I feel sad and desperate, I try to make a plan before you with borrowed chopsticks." The last sentence of the next poem: "Thousands of chapters are connected, the day will tilt, when a basket of flood is about to burst: let's hold hands and look from a high place on the Heqiao, the divine state is close at hand, don't be different." Saionji was moved by the poem, so he agreed to fulfill the promise of withdrawing troops. Thus, "poetry can defeat the enemy," making it a good story of General Zhao's diplomacy.</p>
<p>Gao Mingqu Danian of Guangdong, with the ambition of restoring the Ming Dynasty, led his troops to fight against the Qing soldiers. He was defeated and died in the chaotic army. Before his death, he said to his family: "I went out to fight against the enemy, and unfortunately, I died and my body was exposed in the battlefield, then bury me on the south side of Nanpeng Mountain, and do not offer sacrifices in spring and autumn, so as not to be known by foreign races, so as to calm my grave." After the war, his family picked up his remains and buried them on the sunny side of the mountain. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, Qu's tomb was desolate and lonely, and no grass grew. After the Xinhai Revolution, after the restoration of the old things, the green grass in front of the tomb flourished, and later generations called it the "unconquered Qing" tomb. Qu had five poems of mourning the past in Yamen during his lifetime, and one of them is recorded here: "Regret the past dynasty's affairs, I came to the riverside, the universe has a pulse, the country has three ministers, passionate loyalist's ambition, caring for the lord, until now the stones on the cliff, the wind and rain wash away the barbarian dust." Using national heroes to sing about national heroes, it is appropriate that the words are passionate and慷慨.</p>
<h3>A Record of Listening to Piano Music at the Lyceum Theatre</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>On the 25th, at the Lyceum Theatre's third municipal symphony concert, I found the Mozart Violin Concerto in A major to be very satisfying.</p>
<p>The soloist for this piece was the principal violinist, Riskin. His technique with both hands was excellent. His left-hand vibrato and trills were both beautiful, and his shifts were quite accurate. His right-hand bowing was very clean; the staccato notes, both up-bow and down-bow, were particularly outstanding. The up-bow was definitely a flying staccato, and the down-bow used some unknown method, with very precise speed. This type of bowing is usually considered a difficult path by violinists, and he played it with such success, making it truly commendable. The only drawback was the volume, which was too weak. However, with Professor Foa acting as conductor and Ma Sihong away on a foreign visit, soloists are scarce. Mr. Riskin's solo was indeed sufficient to replace them.</p>
<p>The cadenza in this concerto was composed by Professor Wittenberg. He is a famous German violinist who once played with the renowned pianist Schnabel in Europe. Due to the persecution of Jews in Germany, he wandered to Shanghai. Here, I truly lament the misfortune of this musician.</p>
<p>The municipal orchestra knows that audiences enjoy solos, so in the next performance, they will also present a cello solo by Dukson, along with other symphonies, which is of course something everyone will be very happy to know.</p>
<h3>How to Improve Traffic</h3>
<p>— Ning Shen</p>
<p>The authorities have put in painstaking efforts to improve traffic issues, but the traffic congestion situation has not seen much improvement. Now the authorities are again starting to improve traffic. Therefore, I offer a few small opinions on this issue, which are described as follows: (1) The traffic police's directing seems to still follow the legacy of the British concession era. They must wait for the vehicles on the longitudinal roads to finish passing, and even wait for vehicles coming from afar to pass, before releasing the vehicles on the transverse roads. As a result, the waiting vehicles gather more and more. Once released, they are bound to compete and rush forward, making traffic even more chaotic, worse, and more difficult to control. This situation also exists in Calcutta, India, under British rule. Therefore, the training of traffic police should be thoroughly reformed, and traffic direction should prioritize efficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Restricting non-motorized vehicles on roads with heavier motorized vehicle traffic may not be necessary. If so, it will inevitably make the traffic on another road parallel to this road even more congested. The traffic on Jiujiang Road after Nanjing Road banned non-motorized vehicles can serve as an example. Therefore, roads with heavier motorized vehicle traffic can follow the Nanjing method and divide the lanes for motorized and non-motorized vehicles separately.</p>
<h3>Introducing "The Secret Agent"</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>"The Secret Agent," which premiered at the Jinmen Grand Theater, is a historical film of the Polish Restoration Movement produced by the Soviet Ukrainian film factory. A characteristic of this kind of restoration struggle is underground activity. Therefore, this film also uses underground heroes engaged in secret activities as the main line of the performance, unfolding an epic of arduous struggle against the enemy and for the restoration of the country. The lead actor, Soviet famous actor Demohovski, played seven roles in the entire play. The development of the play is always exciting and tense.</p>
<h3>Dangerous City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Hearing the words "Jincheng River," the man seemed to wake up slightly, and like a startled wild animal, he looked around anxiously. Suddenly, he burst into loud cries.</p>
<p>"Ah! Jincheng River, Jincheng River! Coming out of Changsha, it cost me more than twenty silver bars to get to Jincheng River. But," he suddenly raised his head, stamped his foot and shouted, "These bastards! They set fire in the middle of the night, burning my wife and children to death, and all my luggage was burned. Their consciences are so dark! They only wanted my gold, so they set the fire! Now, my family is destroyed, what's the use of gold? I'm going to throw it away! I'm going to throw it away…"</p>
<p>Saying this, he turned around and ran wildly eastward as if flying. Zhu Zhaonian wanted to stop him, but was too late.</p>
<p>He stared blankly at the back of the madman, and for a long time, he did not have the courage to go into the town again. On such a ruin, wouldn't trying to find a ride be like dreaming? But he saw two or three locomotives and a dozen freight cars wiggling on the railway line over there, so he aroused some hope again. He thought that this crowded and slow railway that everyone dared not try, might still be available for his own use today.</p>
<p>Stepping on the ashes all over the ground, Lao Zhu quickly walked to the old site of the former train station. – That was relatively easy to recognize, because the terrain was relatively high, and there were still some rubble to be found. On these broken rubbles, countless disaster victims who survived the disaster, and thousands of ragged wounded soldiers, were crowded like maggots; all kinds of debris and tattered clothes were scattered around the crowd, and a pungent stench could be smelled from afar. Some people were already sick and were lying on the ground, emitting bursts of piercing groans.</p>
<p>"Isn't this hell?" Lao Zhu thought in his heart, and his pace began to slow down.</p>
<p>Now, he could still see the scenes on the wiggling trains; the rooftops, inside the awnings, and on the steps were all full of people. Needless to say, the most unexpected thing for him was that some people were actually using wooden boards to build on the axles under the carriages, and lying flat there. Fortunately, the speed of the car was slower than a person's walking. If it were slightly faster, none of these people would be able to live.</p>
<p>On the dark brown track, there was also an unprecedented spectacle. All kinds of strange things were thrown there, among which the most were piles of reddish-yellow human feces; it no longer looked like a railway track, but like a garbage dump in a big city.</p>
<p>In fact, the train was not really moving forward. It rolled for a while like a cow, and then suddenly rolled back. The station and car staff were so chaotic that they all looked like newbies who just started working on the first day. Scolding and fighting were constantly being staged.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian was stunned by this strange phenomenon in front of him, and for a quarter of an hour, he couldn't decide what he would do. He felt very empty in his heart, and a kind of negative thought that he had never had before suddenly penetrated his brain, and he even wanted to find a place like Peach Blossom Spring immediately, just to hide himself.</p>
