<h3>參會舉行首次大會　張羣出席報告政治　對國內外情勢詳加說明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕行政院長張羣廿一日晨出席參政會第一次大會，作政治報告，　時八十五分鍾，渠登發言台及報告完畢時，均博得熱烈掌聲，大會於上午九時舉行，出席參政員二百零四人，向張院提出之書面詢問，達五十九件，另有口頭詢問多件，提詢問案者達出席人總數五分之二，足見參政員對當前政治問題之重視。大會由張伯苓主席，秘書處報告：（一）本會參政員現時實額爲三百六十二人，（二）陳源·許文頂·馬騰雲·馬毅·陳璇珍。但懋辛·胡庶華·劉眞如·拉敏益喜楚臣·司徒美堂·周素園·朱之洪等參政員，因事或因病請假，繼爲駐會委員會會務報告及駐委會檢討第四屆第二次大會建議各案政府實施情形之報告，秘書長邵力子臨時報告廿日下午四時接見學生請願情形。張羣報告時爲九時五十五分，至十一時廿分始畢，其後宣讀書面詢問五十九件，歷時竟達一小時之久，至十二時廿分始畢，口頭詢問三十件，改於下午提出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕參政會廿一日下午舉行第二次大會，參政員對張院長政治報告口頭質詢之踴躍，爲參政會大會之空前現象。大會於下午三時開始，至七時卅分散會，歷四小時半，全部時間幾悉爲口頭詢問，張院長靜聽後，即席作概括之答覆，使佔十五分鐘。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕參政會廿一日下午第二次大會議程，因受政治質詢關係，故原定社會及司法行政報告，改爲廿二日下午舉行。廿二日上午仍爲外交報告。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕張院長　在參會作政治報告，首先介紹勝利以還之國內外情勢與外交方針，次詳述和平商談之歷次經過，謂直至今日，恢復和談並非應不應該的問題，如中共願意和平，政府隨時可與商談，但如何使中共回頭，渴望各位參政員貢獻意見。張氏　對當前調　經濟問題，作詳細說明，並宣稱：政院刻正研討經濟改革方案，希望各位參政員貢獻寶貴意見，一旦付諸實施，可以順利推行，至是張院長復特別提出近日學潮問題，除表政府深切關懷教育前途外，並勉勵學生能在享受自由之權利時，顧到守法精神，養成憲政風氣。張氏於結語中聲稱：「本人並非天才，際此時艱出長政院，決無奇跡出現之可能，深感隕越之慮，決鞠躬盡瘁，與國人共勉」。</p>
<h3>張羣報告全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕行政院張院長羣，於廿一日上午國民參政會第一次會議中作政治報告，原詞如下：主席，各位參政員先生：此次大會開幕，正值國步一新，訓政開始結束，進入憲政的準備階段。在制憲的國民大會完成任務之後，行憲的國民大會產生之前，國民參政會乃是目前最富於代表性的民意機構。在此時期，貴會舉行大會，使命實在十分隆重。本人今日出席報告的內容，是政府改組的經過和今後政府施政的重點，請各位參政員先生不吝指教。</p>
<p>國內政治</p>
<p>在報告國內政治之前，我們試先檢討一下戰後的國際局勢，戰後世界各國家都渴望世界的和平和自己的安全，但因爲各方對於世界和平機構的信賴程度不同，因此各個國家對於自己安全的保陣方法也有差別，這種認識與方法的差別，便形盛戰勝國與戰勝國間的爭持，戰勝國家的共同心理，無論如何厭惡戰爭，而歷次國際性的會議所以始終得不到和協一致的結果者，原因就在於此。中國處在這個世界環境中，我們的外交政策是一貫的，中國願意與並世各國家和諧相處，即對於在戰時與我爲敵的國家，也並不存報復之見，特別是美蘇英法，在戰時曾經與中國携手作戰，今後我們更希望加强交誼，加强協力，共同維護世界的和平。對於一切國際未決的問題，都願意遵循外交的途徑求得公平合理的解決方法。中國　護聯合國憲草，忠實履行條約義務，尊重友邦的合法權益，但同時對於自己國家的主權獨立以及國際地位之保持，也具有最堅定的決心。更進一步說，中國的外交政策不獨是企求中國與友邦間的和諧與協力，更企求友邦與友邦之間的和諧與協力。從國際道義的立塲說。是這樣；從中國自己的利害觀點打算，也應該是這樣。然而中國的外交政策所能發生的國際影饗，完全被決定於我們自力更生的程度；倘若我們自己不能有所樹立，則中國不獨不能主動的支配環境，且反要被環境所支配。因此，中國在大戰結束以後，最重要的工作便是統一，民主，和平，建設。爲了達成這些目的，去年十二月國民大會制定了中華民國憲法，閉會以後，政府便立即與參加國民大會的各黨洽商改組政府共同籌備憲政的實施。關於改組政府的辦法，仍本政協決議精神，和平建國綱領仍爲改組政府後施政之準繩，但因爲中共問題未能解決，因此和平建國綱領事實上需要補充。中國靑年黨，民主社會黨，中國國民黨以及社會賢達，都曾經提出意見，結果是依據和平建國網領的精神，共同協定了新政府施政方針十二條（條文略），依據這個方針，國民政府就在上月改組，行政院也隨着改組，政府基礎擴大，由參加國大之各黨及社會賢達，共同參加國民政府委員會，成爲國家最高決策機關，其會議稱爲國務曾議，行政院負執行國府委員會決策的責任。以上所報告的新政府施政方針，政府已於　　駐會委員會提出報告，因應當時情勢未及提出貴會討論即付諸實施，自屬遺憾，還望大會諒鑒，予以接受。</p>
<p>軍事衝突</p>
<p>今天國內的軍事衝突，可說是人人所焦慮而到今天還是沒有解決的問題。中國在過去八年戰爭之中，因爲以弱敵強，不得不集中一切的力量來支持戰爭，雖說是並不完全忽視了建設，但這些戰時建設顯然不能補充驚人的消耗。八年戰爭的結果，顯而易見，人人能說的，是經濟上，財政上的損失；比較不容易看見，或爲一般人所不願意公然承認的，是文化上民德上的損失，上自政府下至鄉村，所受的損失是一樣的嚴重。</p>
<p>全國上下的希望，是在戰爭結束以後，我們能够得到較長時期的休養生息，使我們能够恢復疲敝，創造新生，不幸在戰爭結束之後，緊接着便是共產黨的動亂，一直到現在一年八個月之久，還在繼續着。在這種情况之下，一切建設都談不上，蔣主席早就看到這一點，遠在日本投降之初，即邀中共領袖到渝商談和平建國大計，由雙十日會談紀要產生出各黨派共同參加的政治協商會議，協議了和平建國綱領，可以說這是中國戰後局勢的一個重要轉機。關於政治協商會議的經過，去年三月貴會第四屆二次大會開會時，邵力子先生曾經作過一篇詳細的報告。協議的經神，一是軍隊國家化，實行軍隊整編，以求軍隊編制與軍令的統一；一是政治民主化，實行軍黨分立與軍民分治，並擴大政府基礎，召開國民大會，制定憲法；會議閉幕以後，政府馬上就「恢復交通」與「軍隊整編』兩項問題進行談判，去年二月成立了迅速恢復華北，華中交通的協議及關於軍隊整編及統編中共部隊爲國軍的方案，規定於十八個月內實施，不料政協會議的決議，因關外戰爭的發動，首遭頓挫。關於這一點，，在去年一月十日三人會議協商頒發停止衝突命令時，政府與中共雙方曾有書面諒解，原文是：「上開停止衝突命令第二節，對國民政府軍隊爲恢復中國主權而開入東北九省或東北九省境內調動，並不影響」。但是臨到政府軍隊無論由鐵路或海道運赴東北時，中共軍隊加以阻撓，且於三月中旬佔領政府所已接收之遼北各地，並進攻四平街，長春，哈爾濱。齊齊哈爾各重要城市。至於整軍方面，政府在整軍方案成立後，則努力縮編軍隊，而中共却在東北擴充軍隊。</p>
<p>在去年五月政府還都以前，政府亟盼擴大政府基礎之商談及召開國民大會問題能早成功，因中共方同堅持過分之要求，協商不得結果。政府還都以後，有一時間商談，　陷於停頓，但政府仍舊不惜以最大之忍耐繼續努力，打開僵局，原定五月五日召開的國民大會，也為遷就中共而延了期，六月七日政府又下令東北軍隊停戰十近天，希望再予中共一個轉關的機會，履行協定，然後就完全停　東北衝突，恢復國內交通，實施整軍方案三項問題，與中共　　進行協商。政府的方案，十分具體，而中共則出之以籠統模積的態度，枝節橫生，，使協商不能進行，於是停戰令又延展了八天，正在這二次停戰期間，中共又乘機發動了山東，津浦，膠濟兩綫的全面攻勢，德州，泰安等地相繼攻陷。在這種情形之下，和平商談自然無法進展，反而陷於很嚴重的僵局。（未完）</p>
<h3>全國經委會委員　國府發表聘任書</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕國民政府廿二發表致全國經委會委員聘書，其式爲茲聘陳立夫，劃健羣，蕭錚，黃元彬，陳方，樓桐孫，簡貫三，劉持東，王曉籟，吳蘊初，李銘，鄒秉文，林可璣，萬鴻圖，鄧飛黃，傳汝霖，施奎齡，潘序倫，何浩若，劉航琛，孫隆吉先生，爲全國經濟委員會委員，此聘。</p>
<h3>參政會主席今日投票補選　王雲五王世杰請辭獲大會通過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕國民參政會主席團，頃已接受王雲五，王世杰兩主席之請辭，並經廿一日上午第一次會議中通過，現大會秘書處已定於廿二日舉行投票補選兩主席之繼任人選。按本屆主席團共七名，爲張伯苓，江庸，王世杰，王雲五，李璜，吳貽芳及莫德惠，依據歷屆參政會慣例，每屆只選一次生席團，每次大會，均不加改選，且依照參政會組織條例之規定，主席團各主席人選，不限於參政員，非參政員之現任官吏，亦可當選也。</p>
<h3>接見學生代表情形　邵力子在參政會大會報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕參政會秘書長邵力子，廿一日上午在參政會中報告廿日下午在參政會接見京·滬·蘇·杭區請願學生代表經過，邵氏稱：當時係與雷副秘書長同時接見，並有大會總務，警務兩組人員在塲，本人對學生所提書面意見，當予接受，彼等要求共計五點，本人就其中專科以上學校應一律享受公費待遇一點，予以說明並解釋，認爲此項要求爲不僅不易做到，且亦爲不合理者，關於學生請願部份，本人告以如學生以合理的要求請願，政府朱嘗不可考慮，而昨日不幸之事件，本人希望爲最後之一次，同時，盼能在不幸事件中獲得教訓，並非說此種請願事件爲最後一次，最後學生代表提出軍警阻其進退，請設法解決返校之路綫，本人乃稱，軍警係阻止學生前進，如學生願返校，決無阻止之理，旋經交涉後，即行退出。關於學生受傷部份，邵氏亦提出調查經過，認為重傷僅孫傲傖一名，腿骨折斷，惟無生命危險，醫生正設法以保全其全腿中，其餘尚有十餘人均輕傷。</p>
<h3>加拿大大使戴為世　覲主席呈遞國書</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕加拿大新任駐華大使戴為世，廿一日上午十時在國府覲見蔣主席，呈遞國書，隨覲者有該館參事白德生，商務參事葛禮夫等，我方外長王世杰，國府吳文官長鼎昌，薛參軍事岳，典禮吳局長思豫，外交部禮賓司李司長駿，國府典禮局劉科長迺潘及外交部禮賓司交際科王科長季微等，均參加典禮。</p>
<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張明</p>
<p>廿一日上午張院長報告完畢時，曾說：「我不是天才，不會創造奇蹟」，下午許德珩質詢時也提到「張院長不是天神』，國家大事似乎非創造奇蹟不能解決似的，但是「事在人爲」。　黃宇人的質詢裏曾提到「我們的院長身兼四聯總處副主席，爲什麽堂堂院長要去兼一個副主席呢」？　黃宇仁是口頭詢問中的第一個起立者、台下都說「大砲第一聲」。</p>
<p>下午的主席是吳貽芳博士，吳着黑色大衣，白綫圍巾，倒像個大法官。</p>
<p>一個下午，孔庚一直坐在主席台上聯珠砲打得山響，他也不管，到了最後才下合來聽張院長的答覆。</p>
<p>韓兆霾爲民盟的盟友而呼喚，無疑是帶着悲憤的育調。</p>
<p>會中曾有一次極熱烈的掌聲，是爲首次出席參政會的台灣參政員致敬的。</p>
<p>梁　　說話聲音和字彙無疑是像一個傳教，連說「懺悔」，「反省」。台上是黑服的吳博士，台下是于斌主教，你說聽來要不要呌聲「阿們」？</p>
<p>學生請願的事，自然爲人關心，邵力子的報告，向例也爲人所歡迎，但是不當其時，就不當其令，因爲大家都急急的想聽政治報告，於是邵氏報告未畢，潘通茹就下了催促令，希望快點，郡氏說「馬上就完」態度好極。</p>
<p>張羣報告政府改組，軍事衝突一大段時間，梁漱溟等都閉目靜聽。</p>
<p>簫同茲，許孝炎，坐在新聞記者席最後一排，很親切的樣子。</p>
<p>行將出國醫療血壓過高的傳老斯年，今天到會絞遲，眼睛一閃一閃的走遍了所有的位子，沒有找到自己的座次，最後還是會塲幹事領他走了一個大圈才坐下。</p>
<p>張羣的報告到了財政，經濟部份時，許多人都振起精神來了，但一聽就是「嚴重階段」，「預算超出」，「經濟危機」，「只能漢標」，「物價再漲」……「如何得了」的問題。</p>
<p>有一位先生的畫面質詢中曾提到「社會賢達有什麽標準？有什麽辦法做到社賢二字」的問題，大家都不禁報之一笑。書面質詢，真是一件以一件的送上來了，宣讀員兩位，一位讀十件，更番輪換，每換一人，都使下面的人吃一驚，及至讀到五十件時，台下一番騷動，認爲有截止書面質詢的宣讀而進行口頭詢問的必要。但是邵老大朦解釋一番，書面的必須宣讀，因原來並元書面質詢，以節省時間暫以代替，如不宣讀，勢將重複。</p>
<h3>軍政經教待決問題　政府正慎重研究　張院長在二次會中答詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕廿一日下午參政會第二次大會，出席參政員共一九七人，由吳貽方主席，開會後，即開始政治報告之口頭詢問，中經一度休息，陸續發言之參政員共卅六人，其質詢中心在於呼籲和平及撿討實施新政府施政方針兩點。此外，對學生與軍警發生衝突一事，亦有質詢。</p>
<p>張氏答覆略謂：目前無論軍事，政治，經濟，教育，均有無數問題等待解決，政府正慎重研空中，本人到職僅及四週，若干具體問題，尙示濫用瞭，今得諸先生相告，甚表感謝。至於十八，日國務會議所通過維持社曾秩序臨時辦法，乃根據施行之憲法第廿三條之規定，於維持社會秩序與經濟危急時，可以採取緊急措施，同時、對於學生請願，可實行戒嚴方法，但為欲避免使用武力，乃先行規定請願之程序及法定手續，在該辦法公布前滬。杭已發生學生請願，且有阻碍交通，妨碍公務情事。昨日首都所發生不幸事件，政府一定要考慮善意处理。张氏旋就和平問题答稱：本人認為，諸位先生所詢「什麽時候可以和平，用什麽方法可以和平」甚爲重要，吾人可以好好考慮，惟因限於時間，可否擇期舉行一座談會共同商談決定，張氏並謂：渠每日抽出一個半小時到參政會辦公，與各地來京參政負交換意見，準備答問。</p>
<p>參政員踴躍詢問為歷屆大會未見</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕張羣院長廿一日上午在參政會第一次大會中作政治報告後，各參政員即開始提書面及口頭詢問，達一百零二件之多，以時間計，亦在五小時以上，此種情形，實爲歷屆參政會所未有，各參政員詢問中，最關切者要爲和平統一，學潮，工朝，登靑吏治，徵實徵購，官僚資本，當前經濟危機，新政府施政方針，補貼政策，平衡預算，保障人權，軍民分治以及邊疆等問題。北方參政員對北方各省人民在目前之疾苦情况，陳述甚詳，咸望早得解救。東北參政員　認爲政府在東北低價收購大豆，高價出售紗布辦法，應速謀改善。關於和平統一問題，參政員對此發言者特多，大部認爲今日之局勢已爲最嚴重關頭，和平統一爲人民一致所渴望，惟為覓致和平統一之方法，則應愼重商討，以期行之有效。梁　溟以爲，政府與共黨現在均應雙方反省，善意商討，謀取和平之途徑。今日發言者有王亞明，韓漢瀋，潘朝英，蕭一山，黃炎培，許德珩，孔庚，沈之敬，顧耕野，梁漱溟，何葆仁等，台灣參政員林忠發言後，全體參政員曾該掌歡迎，詢問畢，張院長會綜合答復。</p>
<h3>人民有請願權利　但不能妨害秩序　董顯光答覆記者詢問</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕新聞局廿一日下午四時半舉行記者招待會，局長董顯光答穫各記者問題內容如下：　問，憲法所規定之人民自由，在此準備行憲之過渡時期，能否認爲業已實施？憲法及行憲之其他法律，對於人民示威運動之權，有保障之規定否？</p>

<h3>共學陰謀表面化　又圖組敢死隊擴大學潮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邇來學潮澎湃，引起社會上之不安狀態。此中情形，演至近日，益因共黨方面及其外圍份子之煽動，已見表面化，茲悉共黨方面現正發動所謂「六二全國總罷市，總罷工，總罷課」運動，擬利用此次學潮而加以擴大，造成流血慘案，有意造成社會混亂不安之狀態。日前上海率生晋京請願之代表卅人昨日已有八人先行返滬，其餘代表二三日內亦將歸來。聞共黨方面，獲此消息後，又將準備發動另一陰謀，即擬乘此次學生代表返滬之日，計劃於幕後再度利用學生，藉名「歡迎」前往北站，同時更將有「敢死隊」之組織，準備混跡其間，故意迭成流血案件，俾使事態擴大，以達到其政治上之陰謀，聞目前各校大部分學生因鑒於此次學潮已告變質，故多已採取審愼態度，以免遭受無謂之牲牲矣。</p>
<h3>策動平學潮者「資本」雄厚化費兩憶元呼籲「反饑餓」</h3>
<p>北平學潮插曲</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿一日電〕此間各大學一部份受人鼓動，舉行其所謂「反飢餓反內戰」之遊行，結果因負責治安之警士，防衛得力，幸朱發生重大不幸事件。據熟悉內幕者觀察：此間學潮，或可告一段落，茲將有關遊行之插曲，摘誌數事：（一）遊行行列大　爲「反飢餓反內戰」，參加學生二千餘人，其中以淸華學生爲多，約四百人，該校參加此次學潮之學生三　餘人，日前進城，住在北大校內，策劃　關進行之工作，昨日遊行後，北大方面，僱汽車十餘輛，將此批「嘉賓」，送出城去，以盡「地主」之誼。（二）城外學生今日進城遊行之前，到輔仁大學拉請帮手，該校學生未允，因而校內校外，發生衝突，結果，被力拉去三十學生，參加遊行。（三）中法大學有數人參加遊行，校長李麟玉先生事前不知。（四）學生正在遊行時，記者晨見鐵路學院院長徐佩琨先生，詢問對於此次學潮之意見。徐謂：各校當局教職員如果意見一致，則學潮即可解決。徐繼謂：以鐵院論，如空軍工廠遷移，恢復交大名稱等，均爲不成問題之問題，故不致以爲罷課之原因。記者繼問各校當局意見，是否能一致？徐默然不答。（五）北平名勝之區，爲天安門前之三座門一帶，紅牆碧瓦，相映生輝，北平繁華之區，爲東四西單牌樓，今日遊行學生，經過各該地時，用柏油大刷在紅牆上，塗抹許多刺目反動之標語，漫畫，商店窗牆，有美煥之處，亦即塗畫最多之處，竟竟有學生鼓其飛籥走壁之能，爬上東四牌樓，塗刷柏油標語，較前日街頭演講時，用粉筆寫標語更進一步。因柏油塗抹，不易洗刷，途人過路，嘖嘖惋惜，有老某者，在三座門欣賞此種作品後，喟然歎日：前者整理文物委員會，費去六億整理，今日學生，以柏油大刷，片刻之間，破壞其整齊之美，將來再整理，再花錢，反正老百姓倒楣！（六）據熟悉學潮內幕者稱：策動此次學潮者，計劃完密，資本雄厚，以宣傳論，除街頭臨時塗抹標語不計外：所印各種宣傳品數量甚多，紙張精美，即街頭壁報，每份以一萬計，即需數百萬，其組織中，管宣傳部份，每日印發新聞稿主，及其他臨時通知等品，專用之油印機，即達八部之多；以交通費論，每日各處接洽開會，所用汽車，連同今日遊行所用汽車，及清華，燕京，學生往返所用汽車，其數字至爲驚人。淸華三百學生，住在北大，每日三餐用費，以三日計算，亦在千萬以上。據不完備之估計：陰謀家投在此次北平學潮事資本，當在二萬萬元以上，無怪一壁報讀者搖頭嘆息說：花這許多錢，反而自謂飢餓，眞是滑稽。（七）遊行組織者，向中學拉學生，慕貝女中校長在校親向學生說，現在人們吃的最壞是事實、但根本無飢餓問題，一個去，開除一個，全體去，學校關門，不要上他們的當，學生恍然大悟，安然上課。</p>
<h3>監院派員調查處理學潮情形</h3>

<h3>遠東委會通過　分配賠償品政策　依照遭日蹂躪多寡而定</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日電〕記者今日獲悉：遠東委會對分配日本之賠償，已採取下列政策，即此項分配，應依照各國所遭日本蹂躪之多寡，及其對擊敗日本上之貢戲多寡而定。委員會於五月八日通過一項政策，決定各別國家所獲之日本賠償數，應視「廣泛之政治基礎」而定，即除上述兩項考慮外，亦應考慮該國對抗日本侵略之範圍及時間。委員會復通過有關日本進出口之各項政策，日本之出口貨，僅在下列情形下始可獲准，即進口之國家，必須同意以日本所需要之進口貨作交換，或同意以有用或可兌換之外匯償付此項出口貨。委負會在決定日本之進口來源上，復同意基本之目標，當使處理此項進口貨之成本及困難，减小至最低限度，同時亦須考慮購置時之價格條件及貨物必須及時運至日本之各種保證，然不論在任何情形下，盟國商務委會，可對各種不同之進出口貨物，提出個別之處理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕遠東委員會正設法調解分配比率之歧見。聞美國要求應得最大部　，但不供自用，而將　讓予朝　，菲律賓等國。中國要求在指撥賠償之日本資產中獲得百分之四十，菲律賓要求約百分之十五，其他各國數量較少。遠東委員會之決策已訓令麥帥相機辦理。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>安定與平亂</h3>
<p>社會現象愈顯得動盪，全國人心愈感覺需要安定。這譬如一個病人在熱得將要發狂時，醫生勢必首先用藥使其能减退熱度，止其煩躁。今天中國的政局與社會現象，紛擾動盪，幾至不可究詰，但亦唯其如此，乃有四面八方傳來安定的呼聲。</p>
<p>蔣主席前天在參政會致詞說，「……為了求取國家社會的定定……」，行政院張院長勸告學生也說：「……在政府急需安定的今天……」，這都是政府蔪求安定的表示。</p>
<p>上海市參議會及各法團昨日聯名通電，勸告學生「以安定謀教育之進步」，上海市商會也勸告各大學學生，「由安定學校而安定社會」，北平市各界更舉行肅奸大會，請願速平內亂以安民生。這都是人民渴望安定的呼籲。</p>
<p>安定，安定，在今天的中國，似乎爲一切建設，一切工作的最基本的先決條件了。不安定，祗有更紛亂，而紛擾不已，將有大亂的一天。人民今天的生路，越逼越窄，幾乎到了絕望的邊緣，豈容更使國家陷淤紛亂的深淵。故今天中國的局勢，看似艱難困惑，而實則茍得其竅，異常簡單，卽誰能在此時迅速使國家轉入安定之局，人民必　食壺漿以迎之，馨香禱祝以求之。誰還存心破壞大局，使國家由不安定而更趨於混亂者，國人必深惡而痛絕之。</p>
<p>然則今天如何可以求得安定呢？皮相論者勢將首舉「反內戰」以對，意謂停止內戰，則和平安定可立而待。共實，試一深思，縱使「內戰」之詞可以成立，則應問究竟何以會有內戰？政府固耗國帑以用兵，但苟無背叛國家否認憲法反抗政府之共黨，憑藉其部隊以作亂，則「內戰」又何由而生？故內戰乃由共黨所造成，而共黨在中國之非法活動，實爲今天不安定的酵母。由於共黨在奪取政權的過程中，以破壞社會秩序，製造紛亂現象爲唯一手段，故有共黨的非法活動，決難達到安定的合理願望。認識了這一點，我們果欲獲致安定，就不難對症下藥了。</p>
<p>我們以爲要安定，必須先定而後能安。如何能定？大學說，「知止而後能定」：孟子說，「定於一」。天下斷沒有中心無主，搖擺活動，猶豫榜徨，遲疑瞻顧，而可以希望其「定」的！從前人說得好：「當斷不斷，反受其亂」。何以會當斷不斷？就是自己不能定之故，就是自己不能「化」於「一」之故。所謂止，所謂一，簡言之，就是當局負責的人，自己先要有一個確切的信念，堅定的信念，百折不回，生死以之，寗求是非功罪於萬世之後，而不爲一時羣言紛呶所動搖。我們在這裏敢代表人民敬問政府當局及參政員一句話：「諸公對抗憲作亂的共黨及其部隊究竟取什麼態度？」請諸公作一決定性的答復，而不作模稜兩可的油滑之詞。若諸公以爲共黨這種否認憲法，否認國府訂約，乃至稱兵作亂的作風是對的，就該爽爽快快的自動停戰，自動交出政權，讓共黨要怎麼樣就怎麽樣好了，何必再令前綫將士作戰？若諸公猶自號尊重憲法，猶不願推倒政府，猶想到人民飽受共黨長期作亂之苦而欲爲之解除，則此時謀求安定之道，決非重彈「和談」老調所能奏功，而當懺悔過去，痛改前非，集中全力以平亂了。惟有速迅平亂，才能安定大局。如果還是一面從事剿匪，一面高唱和談，一而標榜法治，一面姑息養奸，徘徊疑慮，舉棋不定，依然弄得全國人民和前綫將士摸不着頭腦，則連自己的精神都沒有一些定力，何能定大局，安人心？「若藥不瞑眩，厥疾弗瘳；」今天殆將要到須服瞑眩之藥的時候了罷。</p>
<h3>出口商品的收買政策</h3>
<p>近傳出口貨款，政府已定有收購計劃；交由中央信託局經辦。如果屬實，亦可說是一種較有意義之經濟上的新措施。</p>
<p>自二月十七日頒佈經濟緊急措施方案，同時放長美匯至一萬二千元以後，出口市面，雖暫呈活動之象，但以囤風太熾，市價愈抬愈高，大多數竟抬至國外售價以上，以致外匯調整失其效用，國產外銷依然阻塞，入超情况，亦復依然未改。從而外匯資金之枯竭，出口商人之困難，以及生產者與加工製造者之痛苦，亦與日俱深，政府縱然設法推廣輸出，情况無所改善。至於資金之停頓，貼息之高昂，棧租·保險·人工等等一切成本之增高，尤其餘事。此等情况，如長此延續下去，不加以及時的補救，則非特生產者與加工製造者皆將以銷路壅塞，减少其繼續生產的興趣，卽採運·販賣·出口·乃至囤積等一切中間商人，亦將以資金呆擱，無利可圖，而紛紛袖手。試問在此情况之下，生產何從增加？外匯何從爭取？失業羣更何從减少？在推廣輸出辦法實施之初，本報卽嘗著論，指出同時有實行收購之必要，其觀點卽在於是。</p>
<p>現在着手收購，雖以價格較高，去路較呆，大體上已較爲不利。然而見兎顧犬，亡羊補牢，究尚未晚。我們很希望所傳非虛，更希望迅速見諸事實。</p>
<p>不過政府收購出口貨物，其目的當然不在一時之利潤，而在乎出口貿易之挽救。語其性質，與其說是圖利，母寗謂爲救濟。縱使意存圖利，亦是圖謀全局的經久的大利，而不在一時的部分的小利。換句話說：此舉係從全部國民經濟上着眼，決非爲財政上或業務上爭取一時之小利。所以目光務須放得遠，計劃務須求其廣，戰前戰後，此類事例，在各國不少概見；如日本之收購生絲，巴西之收購咖啡，美國之收購小麥等，非但買貴賣賤，明白虧本，有時竟把收購物資投諸水中，以緩和過剩的現象。這種氣魄和力量，雖非公私交困如我國目前的政府所易幾及，但其原則，其精神，確爲辦理收購時，和管制經濟時所應恪守。沒有這種眼光和氣魄的人，如果主持收購，只知打小算盤，那就無補於國計民生了！</p>
<p>因爲單純的謀利，並不是政府辦理收購的目標，所以收購的價格，數量，和種類等應確定適當計劃，期與初旨相符。我們認為：所收貨品，第一，應選擇大宗出口化，第二，應選擇私人所不易出口的貨物，第三，應選擇資金特別困難的出口貨。其在數量方面，不宜限制過嚴，但亦不必稍涉强迫；致滋與民爭利之嫌。換句話說，凡屬不願照價出售的，自可悉從其便，任其自由買賣。至收購價格，此問題最難解決。原則上，似以勉敷成本，足以維持生產最爲公允。此當是政府所以辦理收購的主旨，亦卽是救濟出口貿易的關鍵。如果高於此數，或恐推銷愈難，政府不易負担；而不及此數，則販賣與生產者將依舊無去繼續，無從達到救濟的目的。不過成本一項，亦有種種：（一）有直接生產者的成本，（二）有加工製造者的成本，（三）有經營採運或販賣商的成本，（四）有轉輾買賣，形同囤積者的成本。此中（一二三）項最，爲合理，自應予以顧全。其或海外市價，高於國內，徒以運輸·外匯·進口限制等手續上困難，私人無力推銷時，自應按市收購，不宜過於抑勒，以示體卹。</p>
<p>管制經濟，爲時人所樂道；按諸事實，利弊參半，往往不符理想。就當前情勢而論，除外匯外，只有對出口貿易一項，我們仍認為有推行管制政策的價值和必要。現在自由貿易和剷除關稅壁壘等主張，雖呼聲甚高，但澈底實行者，迄今還沒有多見。當此外銷艱阻，國際貿易未能平衡之時，無論從那一個角度去觀察，要單靠私人的力量來推動土貨出口，恢復海外的市塲，事實上恐怕很難。戰敗的日本，其出口貿易，已在盟軍卵翼下，着着進行了。那末，卽使不爲暫時救濟起見，對於這一項工作，似亦有急起直追的必要。所以政府收購出口貨物這一點，我們盼望牠迅速展開，並須大規模地推進，以期於增如生產這一個共同目標上，作一個根本而有效的補救。愼勿枝枝節節，零星點綴，以救濟一部分的出口商爲滿足，至如紗布的內銷限制，煤斤的部分管制，以及東北和台灣某種特定貨物的官運官銷等，在目前，雖各有其特殊的作用；在國民經濟上，究沒有多大的意義。眞正的統購統銷，應從出口貿易上做起。</p>

<h3>美蘇混合委會恢復談判　謀解決韓國問題　霍奇希蒂柯夫發表演說　促早日成立韓臨時政府</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城二十一日電〕美蘇混合委員會已於二十一日下午二時另二分在歷史性之不造宮中正式開幕，由韓境美軍總司令霍奇中將主持揭幕，並發表演說，呼籲美蘇合作及平日成立廟鮮臨時政府。共後蘇方首席代表希蒂柯夫及美方首席代表白朗少將，相繼起立致辭。三人皆異口同聲强調成立朝鮮臨時政府乃該委員會之初步工作。希蒂柯夫之演說中，評論朝鮮人民歡迎恢復混合委員會之『政治熱誠』稱：『日本帝國主義崩潰後，韓北即歸蘇軍總司令負責，迄今該區在民主文化以及國民經濟之發展，皆有顯著之進步。吾人確信以實施莫斯科決議爲基礎，朝鮮必能循民主之路綫發展而成爲一獨立國，並將能參加愛好和平國家之陣營而爲平等之會員國，吾人深知混合委員會之責任，蘇聯代表團必盡力促使莫斯科決議得以迅速與成功地執行。」霍奇中將演說有謂：『余個人謹代表美國政府及韓境美軍總司令向蘇聯代表團致敬。吾人在此實踐强國之諾言，即重新建立自主獨立之朝鮮政府，此項諾言乃總括於一九四五年莫斯科之決議中，該時亦已訂定實踐諾言之方法。美蘇雙方已在來往之公函中同意由混合委員會根據思想自由與方論自由之民主原則，履行莫斯科決議中之倏款，由白朗少將領導之美國代表團已獲得政府之訓令，成成立全由朝鮮人組織之朝鮮臨時政府，為混合委員會第一最迫切之任務。世界之眼光皆集中於混合委員會上，朝鮮人民亦引導而待此政府之降臨。美國及其總司令懇切祝望混台委員會之能在雙方融合態度下順利迅速進行工作。此種融合態度乃由大國間互相諒解而產生。混合委員會將完全符合朝鮮之需要及願望。」美國出席混合委員會代表之名單如下：</p>
<p>首席代表白朗少將（一九四三年五月指揮阿圖鳥登陸之名將）；韋克令少將（美方出席前次混合委員會代表）；本斯博士（經濟顧問前在朝鮮之美僑）；莊納（商務部主任之顧間）。預備代表團名單如下：藍登（美駐韓總領事）克萊地（政治顧問）蘇方代表團名單尚未宣佈。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城廿一日電〕美蘇混合委員會今日在此正式復會，歷時四十五分鐘。觀察家稱：此次會議較本年二月間最後一次會議空氣更爲和睦。希帶柯夫指出朝鮮人民正迫切等待會議之結果。美方代表雖要求准許新聞記者列席旁總，但蘇方不致同意。</p>
<h3>對韓國問題態度蘇似已稍趨妥協</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城廿日電〕關於朝鮮之命運，將由美蘇混合委員會加以決定，預料該會在就朝鮮統一及政治民主化問題成立協議之前，殆將經過長時期之談判。據美國觀察家談稱，美蘇混合委員會所當克服之主要困難，厥爲其所當　予朝鮮政治團體之顧問權之定義，以及朝鮮臨時政府之組織，蘇聯對於美國佔領區內之政黨，原不欲畀予諮詢權力，而此等政黨大半代表地主階級，蘇聯認爲其有全能政治之傾向，且在過去有與日本合作之嫌疑。直至上月間，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫致函美國務卿馬歇爾元帥，始表示同意以諮詢權授予此等政黨。美蘇雙方現均欲迅速解決朝鮮問題，此實乃有希望之象徵。美蘇兩國佔領區內之朝鮮人民亦要求外國軍隊，迅即撤退，朝鮮之經濟情形，現正日趨惡化，尤以蘇聯佔領區爲甚。美國佔領區缺少煤斤，此在蘇聯佔領區，則糧食甚爲匱乏。人民對於現行政治，深表不滿，致美國佔領區內曾發生政治示威遊行，同時又有難民自蘇聯佔領區逃往美國佔領區，源源不絕云。</p>
<h3>美高級海軍將領　訪伊土兩京　料負有重要使命</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉二十日電〕甫自德里蘭進行重要談話畢之美地中海艦隊司令康諾利上將，今日飛抵此間，將與土總理外長國防部長及參謀總長等晤談。同來者有美國海軍官佐十一人。康諾利力言，渠此行使命與一億元對土貸款案無關。康氏在德黑蘭時，曾謁見伊朗王，並曾與伊總理蘇丹納陸長阿馬第等晤談。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕倫敦外交界人士認爲美地中海艦隊司令康諾利之訪問德黑蘭及安加拉，當僅爲一稱儀式的訪問。美海軍之官方解釋則謂，康上將此行爲視察現在東地中海港口作善意訪問之美艦隊。英政府認爲當一高級海軍將領訪問他國時，拜訪該國之總理及國防部長並不足怪。惟政界人士則認康諾利此行，正值國會甫行批准援助希土案之際，可能具有擬具就地防衛計劃之重要性。康諾利德黑蘭之行，復引起美國是否將對伊朗作類似對希土援助之貸款的問題，果爾，則華盛頓對於伊朗及波斯灣之防務，當明白表示其興趣所在云</p>
<h3>印人爭觀美艦　發生一場糾紛</h3>
<p>〔路透社孟買廿一日電〕抵此訪問之美巡洋艦『杜萊多』號，昨日下午開放聽任參觀時，因人數過多，不得不召警察維持秩序，並阻止後來者登艦參觀，因此激起一部份人之忿怒，高呼「滾回去，楊基』。今日該艦已停止供人參觀。「自由新聞報」論昨日之事件，以『巡洋艦迷的羣衆嚐着了美陸戰隊滋味」爲標題，並　，『閃閃發光的刺刀與長槍，作為對熱情的孟買人之答禮」美國官員則否認當時美兵曾上刺刀，「杜萊多」號已定明晨駛日本。</p>

<h3>奧倫杜同意　試組義內閣　尼蒂組閣宣告失敗</h3>

<p>上海市參議會，市地方協曾，市敎育會市農會市記者公會市婦運會市總工會，市商會等團體，昨電呈國府蔣主席，行政院張院長，並通電全國各報館，各法團，各專科以上學校擁護國務會會議所通過之維持社會秩序臨時辦法，並勸吿學生即日停止罷課請願舉動。原文如下：「國民政府主席蔣鈞鑒，行政院院長張勛鑒，暨全國各報館，各法團，各專科以上學校公鑒：數週以來，京滬各處工潮學潮，相繼迭起，最近各校學生且紛以集體請願之名，作逾越常軌之舉，阻擾交通，妨害公務，推演所至，匪惟多數靑年可貴之學業，蒙受犧牲，抑且使整個社會安密之秩序，陷於破壞，瞻念前途，曷勝惶慮！幸蔣主席　慮深謀，於日前發表談話，剴切勸諭全國靑年，崇尙理智，遵守法律，同時國務會議更通過維持社會秩序臨時辦法六項，洵爲當前切要之圖。除代表全滬各界市民，竭誠擁護外，尤盼我全國可愛之靑年，勉抑感情，力崇理智，認淸民主以守法爲先，罷課爲自殺之舉，縱有請求，儘可推派代表，以合法手續，向當局建議，萬不可衊視紀綱，動輒游行聚衆要挾，浮囂暴戾，陷社會於動亂之中，貽國家於無窮之戚。我全國明智之青年，身負繼承國脈之重責，當能共察此意，尙希毅然決然，即日停止罷課請願舉動，恢復常態，努力學業，以安，謀敎育之進步，以守法求任務之完成，謹佈個忱，諸維亮察是幸。」</p>
<h3>復員青年軍學生　反對罷教罷課</h3>
<p>昨發表吿全國同學書</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海專科以上復員靑年軍學生，昨發表「吿全國同學書」，略謂：「根據合理方式，增加公費，提高敎育經費，反對罷敎，罷課等破壞敎育的行爲。敎育爲立國之本，敎育經費必須提高，才能培育人才，興建國一家。學生到學校，應以讀書爲重，罷課遊行，犧牲學業，對不起自己，對不起家長，對不起國家，何况今日的學潮，充滿了陰謀與欺詐，純潔的同學，無形做了政治上的工具。對於學校問題，我們應該提出其體意見，要求政府合理解決。」</p>
<h3>學生想上課竟不能上課</h3>
<p>暨大學生自治會昨吿記者</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕暨南大學學生自治曾，爲該會本屆當選常務理事王世華，及理事于煥鎔二人，被上屆自治會主持人綁架，迄無下落事件，於昨日下午二時，在橫浜橋新利酒家招待各報社記者，由該會負責人報吿事件發生經過，並籲請新聞界主持正義，保障人身自由基本權利。據云：綁架原因，則在策動此次之「吃光蓮動」。對於此一運動，我們的意見是絕對要求敎部增加公費數目，及公費名額，（本會且已去電響應中大並敎部），但不贊成「吃光」，因本校自費同學佔大多數，「吃光」僅爲少數人有利之舉，現在學校全爲一種恐怖氣氛所籠罩，想上踝而不能上課，而校長又已辭職，學校行政亦完全陷於無政府狀態中。凡此種種，皆爲少數人武力統制所造成，在此民主潮流高漲之際，乃有此種不講法理之現象發生，實爲遺憾。凡我崇向理性人士，務請全力予以制止，則不勝幸甚。</p>
<h3>市府將派警員保護大同校產</h3>

<h3>穗學聯會發表　告全國同學書</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿一日電〕市學聯會以近來各地學潮，學生多有超越國民道德與國家法律範圍，頃特發表吿全國同學書，略謂各地學潮行動，已超過敎靑界綫，墜入政治漩渦，顯係受共黨份子所操縱，使學校成政爭之塲，學生爲政治之狗。文中並特別指出共黨縱兵攻掠，實應負戰亂之咎，而若干學生，反以戰禍之責諉諸政府，對共黨則不加片言，謂未受人指使其誰之信，文末勗全國同學，應體念國家危難，與本身職責之重大，勿作盲目之舉。</p>

<h3>白粳略見回挫　米市交易旺盛　食油到貨多價見回小</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因受前晚暴風雨影響，到貨較少，計南市塲到三千六百六十三石，北市塲到三千八百五十九石　。市勢承上日漲風，仍極堅俏，交易甚爲興旺。上檔白粳北市塲前日喊卅三萬，南市塲喊卅一萬八千元。　昨南市昇挺，北市小挫，兩市已拉平爲卅二萬五千元。中貨白粳則做卅一萬至卅二萬元，次貨廿九萬五至卅一萬三千元。薄稻高貨卅一萬五至卅二萬五千元，中貨卅萬五千元至卅二萬元，次貨卅萬至卅一萬五千元。</p>

<p>社會局糧食科長吉明齊昨稱：蔣主席前電令各地軍隊不得任意就地收購軍糧，應由糧食部統籌辦理，此舉對於產區糧價之抑平有助頗多。現四川秈米每石價祗五六萬元，值此長江水漲，無論運貨如何昂貴，來滬後總可獲利。他如蕪湖及江西等地，亦可有米運來，外加洋米貼補，靑黃不接時期想可設法溪過。</p>

<h3>二季外棉限額分配昨已竣事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外棉核配委員會於昨日下午五時，在限額分配處召開會議，到主委李榦，委員榮一心，列席郭棣活，劉文騰等，討論至六時許散會。當對第二季外棉輸入限額美金二千萬元，約合外棉十萬包，分配竣事。分配辦法，係根據各紗廠紗錠枚數爲標準云。</p>
<p>又悉：關於第一季外棉輸入限額美金四千萬元，約合外棉廿三萬包，其中三分之一，業已抵埠，三分之一在途運送中，尚有三分之一正待裝船。預計六月底前，可全部運華。目前各廠平均存棉量爲三個月，第一季限額外棉到齊後，則存底足可維持至十月底。如第二季限顆外棉，能於十月底前裝滬，則年內棉花之供應量，已足敷需用。國棉大致可在九十月間登塲，惟現以運輸不暢，最早須延至明年初，方能運滬供用云。</p>
<h3>新經濟部長將來滬　商決紡建當前難題</h3>

<h3>法蘭羢銷旺</h3>
<p>法蘭羢銷路邇來頗見旺盛。本街客幫續有需要，素色淡灰及中灰，零躉交易管夥。本廠貨每碼齊沽十一二萬元以至十五六萬元。美國貨售十四五萬元，英國貨售十八萬以至二十七八萬元。香港貨售二十萬元左右，斜花底較之板四底為暢活，本廠貨生產遠較往年爲多，因此造成產銷二旺之局面。</p>
<h3>昨價與上日軋平　人造絲市平穩　廠經買戶觀望漸呈疲狀</h3>
<p>人造絲市已入定境，昨日仍在七百萬元內盤旋，終與上日價軋平。一二〇號高山有光開盤六百七十萬元，上午到七百萬元收盤，金三馬一千七百萬元有成交。下午最後喊價爲六百七十萬元有人要，九十萬元賣出，其餘各牌貨均無上落。</p>
<p>廠經因買戶觀望，漸呈疲狀。昨市各級喊價，俱比上日短去三十萬元至五十萬元不等。E字等級做價一千九百八十萬元，普通另祖討價一千九百萬元，成交極少，趨勢似尚有軟意。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市亦頗平穩，眞絲被面大誠貨喊價八百四十萬元，還價八百三十萬元未成交。格子壁縐開盤喊二千三百元，做到六百元後即告回落，最後喊二千元。隔日期做二千三百元，沖電力紡產地報小，生坯廿三萬元，故昨日申市做開廿六萬至廿七萬元之譜，其他各貨無甚變化。</p>
<h3>供多求少　市依然無神</h3>
<p>昨日紗市以銀根依然緊俏，塲上做開，因紡建公司開紗關係，供售不寂，而客帮納胃亦轉平淡。兼以布價下降，故喊價二十支紗下挫甚鉅，雙馬做六百六十萬元，軋小二十萬元。四二支藍鳳一千一百九十萬元，比上月下瀉四十五萬元。惟三十二支及十六支紗，毛巾手帕及襪廠家有進，價呈堅穩。</p>
<p>紡建公司昨照例開紗，各支債格較上期粗紗趨疲，而細紗稍形挺秀。共售八二四件，全部售予廠商，申購單共六二七張云。</p>
<h3>布市趨疲</h3>
<p>昨日棉布晨開需求尚旺，喊價一度挺俏，旋傳華北出口將加限制，而前日紡建供售之布疋，五福細布及如意漂布，雖挨號派售，染廠家均全數照配，坯布籌碼充裕，業中人受銀根壓緊，本街納胃呆滯，津帮等在市傾吐，行情遂告不支。十二磅龍頭細布由三十萬二三千元至最後爲廿九萬三千元，比上日軋降一萬三千元。其餘五福藍鷄彩球等各牌細布，亦一律叵挫自八九千元至一萬四五千元，全日趨勢，各布俱在軟檔徘徊。</p>
<h3>十六期台糖今日起配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕物價評議會食糖小組，於昨日召開第三次會議，決定自今日起，台糖公司配售十六期台糖。價格因台幣匯率變更，故依例調整。各檔價目爲：（一）配售價：特號棉白每担卅九萬五千元，一號棉白每担卅六萬五千元，特號砂白每担卅八萬五千元，二號砂白每担卅五萬元。赤砂每担卅二萬五千元。（二）批發價：特號棉白每担四十四萬二千元，一號棉白每担四十萬九千元，特號砂白每担四十三萬一千元，二號砂白每担卅九萬二千元，赤砂每祖卅六萬四千元。</p>
<p>又本市第三期計口配糖，昨會中討論決定於月底前辦竣繳款，出貨，發證手續，自六月一日起開始發售，每人一斤，價二千二百元。</p>
<p>昨糖市仍係初疲後緊之局，結果略鬆。公會劃盤，秘魯砂初爲四十一萬三千元，旋降至四十萬〇三千元至六千元，下午回好萬元上落，曾升至四十一萬六七千元後稍鬆。汕靑仍持原價，刁靑開五十包，廿四萬五千元。興化白三十八萬五千元至卅八萬元，小五千元。興赤二十八萬五千元至二十八萬元，成交二三百件。</p>
<p>本埠大工企業公司，係英國蘇格蘭Scottish　Wire　Rope　Co之中國及香港方面獨家經理，承銷各式鋼絲繩。該廠規模宏大，對於定貨，能大量供應云。</p>
<h3>茶商聯席會議申請　中農先撥毛茶貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於改進本年度茶貸方案，茶商方面本將建議採行貸款代製辦法，產茶由政府作價收購。茲悉：中央銀行，中國農民銀行，中央信託局，中國茶業聯營公司等，曾於昨日上午，爲此事而一度集議，認爲該項辦法，實施上有困難。政府旣難於規定收購價格，且佔計全部收購價款，已達二千億元，數額龐大，難獲邀准。而現有中國農民銀行之茶貸方案，對貸款方式，成數，條件等，均已有詳細規定。故決定先就現有貸款方案，由茶商方面提出改進之建議議案，俾便提交四聯總處核示。昨日下午五時許，本市茶葉輸出業同業公會，中國茶業協會，及東南茶區茶廠聯合會等機構，乃召開聯席會犧。出席各機構代表多人，由壽景偉主席，討論至六時卅分散會。討論結果，當決議建議當局，先請中國農民銀行在本年度茶貸八百億元中，先撥付毛茶貸款二百億元，交由中國茶業聯營公司，會同中國農民銀行，及上海，漢口，福州三地茶葉輸出業公會，及各地茶葉同業公會，按照各地茶廠資歷及其生產能力，分別貸放。聞該項建議，將交由中央及中國農民銀行轉陳四聯總處核示云。</p>
<h3>國行希望茶商贖回押款箱茶</h3>
<p>據悉：國行對於去年度茶商要求向政府作抵押貸款之箱茶，當時曾規定將來貨由茶商備款贖回，自行推銷。現國行方面仍希望茶商贖回推銷，以謀出口事業之推動。倘茶商仍不能履約，則決由政府代爲銷售，再與茶商淸算欠款云。</p>
<h3>地毯輸美困難</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿日電〕經營中國地毯之入口商對記者謂，彼等自戰事結束後，即未輸入中國地毯。美國市塲上競爭較前激烈，中國法幣價格，漲落不定，美海關抽稅亦較前爲高，如不改善，則進口商不致重新經營中國地毯。</p>

<h3>鄧錫侯　縱談川政</h3>
<p>— 成都十四日航訊　本報駐蓉記者周學端</p>
<p>川政自去歲張岳軍主席請假離職後，人事醖釀，一波三折，直到這次政府改組，張主席出長政院，代理省政的鄧錫侯奉召晋京，川局改組，始臻明朗化，所以鄧主席這次南京述職，對於四川今後政治與建設，關係綦大。鄧主席此次晋京，遂愈爲關心川局的人士所重視。</p>
<p>南京述職</p>
<p>收穫極為圓滿</p>
<p>鄧主席於上月廿九日奉召晉京，留京旬日，十二日專機返蓉。當日午後，即在風塵勞頓之餘，接見記者，縱談赴京述職經過與今後川政建設大計，並解答記者所提出的各項問題。</p>
<p>首先鄧氏以極愉快語氣，暢談赴京動機，原爲代理主席已八月，特向中央報告數月川康軍政措施，並請示今後建設方針。留京旬日，曾先後謁見蔣主席三次，並累晤政院張院長，交部會部長及中樞負責長官，對四川今後車政措施方針與經濟建設推動辦法，指示籌商，極爲完美，諸如今後四川的經濟建設，政治推進，治安確保等問題，都得到具體的決定。</p>
<p>建川原則</p>
<p>主席昭示三點</p>
<p>蔣主席對於新四川的建設，最爲關懷，再次面勗鄧氏，以四川爲全國模範省，應發揮建設的領導作用。主席並指示建川原則三點：（一）轉移風氣，（二）加强治安，（三）積極建設。鄧氏謂「主席累次召見本人（鄧自稱），均囑努力從公，並以任勞任怨願相諭勉」，「尤其在轉移風氣方面，如嚴禁烟毒，，取締不良組織等，皆有明切指示。」同時，「中樞要人多以旅川每年，咸視四川爲第二故鄉，對新四川的建設，期望至殷，樂望厥成。』鄧氏認爲現在是四川建設的千載良機，川人應該上下一心，戮力建設，才不負　主席的股股期望。</p>
<p>五年計劃</p>
<p>中央全力協助</p>
<p>關於建設四川的「建川五年計劃」鄧主席以興奮口吻談到請中央協助完成的洽商結果：「四川建設，經緯多端，而五年計劃是整個的，故五年計劃的的完成，是川省人民一致的翹企盼望。一「建設最主要的是經費，這次本人赴京，帶了五年建設的全份計劃，並與財部洽商經費問題，決定經費來源：（一）川省自籌一部，（二）中央補助，（三）利用外資。關於第一年建設經費，中央決定補助，並決以全力協助川省，俾五年計劃能如期完成。」</p>
<p>兩大建設</p>
<p>積極動工興修</p>
<p>全國矚目的戰後四川兩大建　設——成渝鐵路與都江電廠——目前雖動工，而經費迄無具體着落。鄧氏此次赴京的主要任務之一，即是解決兩大工程的整個經費問題。鄧氏高興地說及洽商經過：『興修成渝鐵路，中央極表關心。工程經費，原定中央與地方各半，經本人累次與兪大維部長磋商結果，決定整個二百五十億，全部由中央負祖。並據兪部長談，中央今年已將成渝路土木工程經費三百九十億列入預算。」「關於法國借款，因利息問題尚未解決，法代表班沙已於上週抵京，在週內即可與川建應長何北衡會同簽字。」關於都江電廠修建，鄧氏謂：『加拿大政府表示，盼川省府派人赴加洽商，省府正考慮擬請盧作孚氏赴加一行。現中央已撥款七億元，啓運電機，決先發電二萬五千瓩。總之，這兩大建設，在中央關切協助下，積極動工，務期於限期全部完成，殆可不成問題。</p>
<p>發展實業</p>
<p>强化川省工業</p>
<p>四川經濟建設的另一部門，即是當前最感迫切的事實需要，『發展四川實業與强化工業」，這也是鄧主席赴京商合任務之一。鄧氏爲此曾與張公權。翁文　兩氏幾度研究，認爲：「輕而易舉的重要經濟建設，應當着重發展四川固有實業，本人在京，與中央洽商，決請政府扶助四川，發展外銷貿易，增加桐油·棉花·豬鬃·糖·鹽等生產。」鄧氏繼述：「關於强化四川工業，本人曾要求救濟物資與日本賠償工廠，分配四川，現中央已允將威遠鐵廠，資屬鋼廠，及重慶北碚等地之國營工廠，劃歸省營。日本賠償之電機廠與硫酸廠，均將撥歸川省，以奠立四川工業化基礎。」『爲配合發展實業與工業，中央並將發展四川交通，除成渝鐵路外，天（水）成（都），川黔兩鐵路，亦將同時建築。」</p>
<p>確保治安</p>
<p>川康防務無虞</p>
<p>最後，鄧主席以誠摯語調，保證：「川康治安必可確保，並爲適應時勢需要，川康綏署暫時保留。充實地方武力方面，已請中央補助械彈，加強駐軍與保安隊力量。同時，在最近，共黨絕無擾川之可能，而川康境內潛伏的萑符流盜，短期即可全部肅淸。」西康問題，鄧氏答稱：「主席對西康近况，至爲關注，曾面囑本人轉告劉主席，務必認眞努力，特別是禁政，更應認眞推行。」</p>
<p>從這位新主席的信心，再配合新改組的省府人事，記者未到川政建設前途，正閃着光明的遠景。</p>

<h3>徐州到臨城</h3>
<p>— 九日臨城快訊　本報記者淩松壽</p>
<p>人力車古色古香</p>
<p>徐實在沒有什麼可愛的地方，漫天漫地的黃沙，粗俗的人物，不入耳的言語……初到徐州，總不會給你一個太好的印象。假如一定要說出她的可愛之處，那人力車倒挺不錯—這是我的看法。車子上嵌鑲了黃銅的圖晝和花邊，顯得古色古香。</p>
<p>鷄鴨湯加一個蛋</p>
<p>第一次到徐州蒸飯，硬得很但却合我的口胃。這一次來我吃了一頓「啥」。</p>
<p>眞怪，一碗鷄鴨湯裏面加上一個鷄蛋，就定成這樣一個怪名字「啥」。我喝了一碗，吃了四個大包子，直到午後三時，肚子裘還不感覺到飢餓。</p>
<p>處處響夜夜無光</p>
<p>徐州現在軍事重鎮，天上的飛機聲和馬路上來來往往的汽車喇叭聲，馬達聲，響成一片。</p>
<p>也許是市政當局覺得馬路上的灰塵揚得看不下去了，這幾天有好多馬路，都趕舖着石子路面，這是好現象。不過在我看來，徐州終究還是徐州，儘管她將來地位再重要些，可是限於先天的條件，要想把牠改變成像南京上海那樣，恐怕很難辦到。不講別的，擦皮鞋的生意在這兒很情淡，路上的小攤把椅十拍一拍，問我：「擦吧」？我看看前面一陣陣的黃沙，向他搖搖頭。</p>
<p>晚上，馬路上沒有路燈，一片一漆黑，十幾輛人力車連貫起來，一字長蛇陣似的在廣闊而靜寂的馬路上跑着，另是一種風味。請千萬別奇怪，這正和五層高的洋房下面擺着那粗陋的陶器攤兒，以及倚着許多捉蝨子的人們一樣，誠然是徐州的缺點，却也正是徐州的嫵媚之處。</p>
<p>徐州到臨城的火車，每日上下行各兩次。照時刻表上載明上行第一次是徐州滕縣間混合車，七點三十分開。第二次是浦口臨城間三等車，十點二十五分從徐州開出。記者爲了坐三等車，乃不惜白等了幾個鐘點，而坐第二次車。誰知道第二次車仍全是貨車，承車長的允許，記者在守車中用皮箱做櫈子坐了下來。</p>
<p>車震動鬧成趣劇</p>
<p>和我同車的有一位魯南師管區的某少將軍官，曁家眷等，一共五口，二個大人，三個小孩。因爲檢查機件，守車每停站再開一次，麥劇烈地震動一下，於是不是哥哥跌下來，便是妹妹倒下去，否則乃是抱在手中的小弟弟碰到母親的額角上。開一次車，即表演一次，有時還伴奏着哭聲和笑駡聲。記者冷眼旁觀，覺得這一幕一幕的趣劇，頗有意思。</p>
<p>過了柳泉站，就到利國驛。這是蘇魯交界地區，爲江蘇省唯一的鐵產地。車站之西，有很多的工廠，但現已變成了一片死寂，烟囱裏不見一絲的烟冒出來。賡一練北行，路旁每個碉堡上，均異一直地站着哨兵，以刺槍式的姿態，注視着前面。鐵路右面是靑山起伏，在飄渺隱約之間，左面則是運河，烟水蒼茫，南流不盡，一切是緊張，但也是靜寂，聽到的祗有車輪的轆轆聲。接近臨城時，車過孟家莊·韓莊·各站，斷壁頹垣，凄凉觸目，尤其是孟家莊車站，以兩節車廂權充辦公室，眞令人有啼笑皆非之感。</p>
<p>飯店裏沒有猪油</p>
<p>臨城這地方，是當津浦路與臨棗支綫的啣接之，當年的重要和繁榮，是可以想見的。可是在勝利後爲共軍圍困了十八個月之後的今天，臨棗支綫經修復之後復遭受第二度的破壞。津浦路正綫雖已通到滕縣了，然而每天兩列混合車所帶來的，除了還鄉難民之外，絕無他物。全鎭房屋破壞大半，車站的房屋，是覆巢之下倖存的三間，有一座高達數十丈的水塔也不能用了……破壞，貧窮，嚴重地襲擊着牠。全鎭人口約一萬五千三百餘人，食糧奇缺，三千五百元一斤的猪肉，在我們看來，究許還覺到便宜，祖在這裏，恐怕已沒有當地人出這樣大的價格去買了。我在小飯店中吃了一餐飯，沒有猪油，問問老闆，說是每天出的少數猪油，都給部隊眷屬預定了去。</p>
<p>到臨城來，我的第一目標是聽說徐兗綏靖區司令官李玉堂將軍駐節於此，想訪問訪問。此外，又因爲聽說有很多難民　集此間，也想看看是什麽情形。</p>
<p>工作隊　主要賑務</p>
<p>可是我失望了，李將軍現已移駐滕縣，而難民業已陸續還鄉。記者穿街插巷，找到了行總魯靑分　魯南辦事處的所在地。片子投進去，出來延見的是該區第二工作隊賑務股高慶鴨股長。交談之後，才知道，魯南辦事處已遷徐州，該隊則留在此間繼續辦理救濟工作。他們這一隊的工作地區是從滕縣到兗州的這一段鐵道兩側地區。先後在臨城辦過這兩次普賬：第一次在去年年底，計發出賑粉四一二四袋，舊衣一〇〇五四件，賬款三五六一〇〇〇元。第二次在本年一月至三月間，計發出賑粉一八九五袋。目前，他們主要的工作，是辦理收復區的急賑和工賑。現在已經發放的有：　縣二〇〇〇袋，兗州四五〇〇袋，鄒縣五〇〇袋。不過由於經費的不充足，不能直接地發到縣區，只有請具領機關自己來搬了。更因交通不便的關係，所以兗州的應領賑粉，迄今尚未搬走。工賬方面，現已在自竟州到濟甯一段間的運河堤實行，每挑一方土，可得麵粉二斤半，每人每天多的時候可以挑十方，便能得到二十五斤麵粉的報酬，也算不錯的了。</p>
<p>小遊戲天下太平</p>
<p>在難民　集之時，此地約有程度，收容有難童三百餘名，以實行教養兼施爲目的。現在因已陸續返鄉，祗剩下三十多名學生。</p>
<p>臨城一宿，別無可記，只有一件最有意思的事。那就是：街頭上三三兩兩的兒童，以剪刀，紙頭，石塊之戲，而寫「天下太平」四字，勝一次，添一劃，誰先寫成，就算是勝利。大家在把小拳頭伸出來比較勝負之前，嘴中先呌着：「天下太平」，然而，什麼時候可以太平呢？我想：這該不僅是兒童的呼聲吧！</p>
<h3>台省小擷</h3>
<p>— 嘉義四日航訊　帝冬</p>
<p>台灣房子的建築和構造，頗有一提的必要，房子的建築一一般地說來，是以木頭爲主，但是結構與設計，都非常精緻適用，再一棟住宅，都有客廳書房和衛生設備，門窗多用玻璃，開關稱便，空氣尤爲暢流，再座房子建築佔地，總在數畝以上，所以都有寬敞的院子，空地，說到街道和一般店舖也可稱譽，是整潔寬闊，並且馬路的兩旁還栽植有常靑樹，中間行車，兩邊走人，秩序井然，筆者初到台北的時候，深深地讃佩合北的都市建設，不特是進步的，而且是成功的，因爲它帶上了田園都市的風味，又把商業區和住宅區如此嚴謹的劃分，我們在飛機上烏瞰全市，油然會使你感到已有都市的宏規，又有田園的風趣，蒼蒼可愛的綠樹，遍植在整個城市的角落。</p>
<p>水電方便住屋舒適</p>
<p>雖然自本土初來的一般人，首先感到起居最不愉快的一件事，是入客廳或睡房要脫鞋子的麻繁，可是經過了一些日子習慣了後倒也不覺如何？現在從本土到這裏來的公教人員，待遇這般的低微，數口之家，幾有捉襟見肘無法維持的艱困，與其說大家情願過這稱艱難的日子，母甯說是感到這裏的氣候宜人，水電方便，住宅舒服，就以筆者住的房子來講，原是二三流的，但是前些日子，朋友們居然開玩笑的說：你的房子比起戰時重慶部長階級住的，還有過之無不及，誠然在日本時代爲了要獎勵日本人到台灣來，搜刮我們台灣的資源以供他們作侵略的資本，日本政府對於來台的人員，是特予優待方一便的，日人統治時代，組織龐大的營建機構，就是專爲日本人到了台灣以後，給了他們安定住的問題的一個總機關，凡是到了台灣的日本人，可以按職位之高低，向營建機構借款造房子，所需的建築費用，可分期付還，因了有這個帮助移民解決住宅問題的機構，普通一般荐任級的公職人員（自然委任的也有）都有相當寬敞和設備的宿舍，至於各部門的主管人，另有官舍的供給，光復以後，我們本土來的公教人負接住了他們的房子確也叨光不少</p>
<p>儉樸刻苦慣吃冷飯</p>
<p>在日人長期統治下的合胞們，不特風俗習慣改變了，甚至連日本民族刻苦耐勞的精神也完全學到了，台胞儉樸刻苦的生活，是會令我們佩服的。普通的老百姓，雖和本土的人一般每天照樣吃三頓，但是他們大半都是早上燒一頓，中午和晚間却不再燒了，他們有吃冷飯的習慣，就以一般台籍的公教人員來說，每天早上去辦公以前就以預備好約一二碗飯，把他張在「白鐵盒」裏放進極有限的蔬菜，名呌「便當」散公以後，就在辦公廳如狼似虎的吃，旣不用湯，也不用水，其次穿的衣服，也非常隨便，男的雖喜歡穿西裝，却不大講究，大半都不結領帶襯衣也不整潔，尤鮮熨得光亮的，說到女人習尚穿裙和西裝，樣子倒不難看，如果是身材合度的人，着起來還有一種令人感到嬌健美觀。</p>
<p>職業女子形形式式</p>
<p>沒有到過這裏的人，心目中都以爲台灣的女人特別妖冶風騷，甚至有些人在前些日子勸告丈夫已到這裏的太太們，要趕快追來，不然，難保丈夫不給台灣女人搶去了，筆者就曾親見不少太太們，居於這種念頭，冒萬險駕輕舟來比的，其實台灣的女郎，倒也不如相傳之那個，少女們誠然都有職業的習慣與興趣，所以在都市裏，就產生了各種不同職業的女人，如酒店裏有所謂一羣羣的「侍應生」旅店裏有侍候客人的「女中」機關裏有少女充工役，官舍裏有燒飯洗衣的「下女」幷且都束裝時髦，抹粉塗脂，但是這些職業少女，除了酒店旅館的爲了生活之鞭的驅迫，比較可以任客人調笑玩弄，至於「一女」和「工役」可說大半是　　的勤勞刻苦掙取微薄的工資，以惟持數口之家生活的，上項的職業少女，一般的年齡都是廿五歲以下到十七八歲所以本土初來的人，看見了她們都深覺奇怪，幷且她們的態度言行似乎顯得那般天眞，不，應該說是輕佻婀娜，甚至任客人的調笑亦極平凡自然這都是日本時代的遺風，據說一般未嫁的女人，的確是較爲隨便，但是當她們擇定了對象，甚至出嫁以後。却異常嚴謹規矩，目前機關裏充當工役的少女，做起事來着實小心認眞，因此光復以後，無論是中央和地方的機關，多半還沿用女工的舊習。</p>

<p>解決本市米荒一議</p>
<p>近日本市發生米荒，引起社會極度不安，多數市民，主張政府從速抑平米價，筆者認爲僅僅硬抑米價，不但不能解除米荒，且徒然杜絕米源，造成更嚴重之局勢。</p>
<p>目前市政府社會局努力於食米配給，然而配給是否能公平普遍，以及勞苦大衆的時間上精神上是否將遭受損失，多成問題，所以筆者認爲配給祗能起消極作用而不是解決米荒的良策。</p>
<p>上海不是產米區域，而位在產米區域的邊緣，所以要解決米荒唯一對策是疏通米源，政府要獎勵米商赴無錫等產米區域採辦食米，對於經濟上的通融和運輸上的利便，政府在可能範圍內給予帮助，一方面限制其應得利潤，弗任米商攫取暴利，同時注意其進出數量，以免囤積。</p>
<p>尤應注意者，上海米商到產米區大量採辦，亦足以刺激當地米價，故政府應竭力採辦洋米，以資挹注，時屆靑黃不接，望政府迅採有效措施，以弭隱憂。（鄔信寶）</p>
<p>同時，讀者陳立觀懷保等來函呼籲，大旨相同，不再刊登</p>
<p>公教人員生活呼</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個窮公務員，要說薪級太低話，還不算是很低的，底薪也有一百四十元，薪津連現在實物配給差額金計算起來，也有四十萬之收入。在三月份以前，維持三口之家，苦開消尚可勉强過去，但以現在的物價，就相差懸殊了，一粥一飯，都難維持，這不是向政府訴窮，而需望政府加點津貼。我想一個公務員，每日上午八時半就要到公，直至下午五時才退，遲到早退是要受罰的，事情辦錯了，要按情節輕重受處分的，這是政府整飭官箴，當然要如此，也是公務員，對政府辦事，應該要盡職的，那末政府對於公務員的生活，也應該要負起責任來，予以合理的維持，這才能够振起公務員辦事的精神，現在的物價，已漲到如此之高了，政府旣未有壓低有效辦法，而對於調整待遇，還在擬議中，公務員已餓到奄奄待斃的時候，希望將調整辦法，從速制定從速實施！（胡言）</p>
<p>又一函：日來物價飛漲，漫無止境，同人生活，日趨艱困，已無以維持。查鎮江介於京滬之間，土產物價高於南京，外貨則高於上海。乃去歲調整待遇時將鎭江列爲二級，顯失平允。同人等夙抱固窮之節，雖曾一度提出異議，亦未再事爭取，現在物價之高壓愈甚，調整之願望愈切，尤望顧及事實，務與京滬區同列一級，否則實難安於工作。（國立江蘇醫學院教職員）</p>

<h3>左文襄在西北</h3>
<p>— 趙宗預</p>
<p>秦翰才著　商務書館出版</p>
<p>有一個極重大的問題，數千年來成爲懸案，始終不曾獲得妥善的解決辦法，這是什麽問題呢？就是西北問題。論理，西北是中華民族的發祥地，西北問題原是中國的內部問題，是中國內部極重大的問題，可是數千年來，誰都當他是邊疆問題，處理的方式，大概不出三種，第一種是武力解決，國家富　時，用一面倒的兵力，去鎭壓西北，壓力收效，至多加之以安撫，從不作澈底的工作，如漢代的班超，鎭護西域，就是一個例子。第二種是懷柔政策，運用儒家所主張的「繼絕世，舉廢國，治亂持危，朝聘以時，厚往而薄來」，的方法，保持天朝上國的體面。第三種是關門不問，暫時斷絕往來，一言以蔽之，歷代都是認西北爲邊疆問題，從不視爲內部問題。</p>
<p>前淸對於西北，總算化過不少功夫，左宗棠就是主持這項工作的人。秦君翰才，對於左宗棠一生歷史，當有研究興趣，搜集左宗棠的材料，切實研究，已有十年之久，用現代眼光，詳加耙梳，經過分析綜合，最近把研究所得，關於左宗經營西北的一部分，先行刊行問世，書名左文襄公在西北，共分十二章，除了軍事平定陜甘與收復新疆以外，舉凡財政設施，民政設施，經濟設施教育設施，都有很詳細的記述與評價，在財政設施一章，又分西征經費分析，整理田賦，整理鹽務，整理茶務，整理厘金，舉辦捐輸，舉辦外債，整理幣制八節；民政設施一童，又分整飭吏治，振作政風，荒政，禁烟惠民之政等八節；經濟設施一章，又分開渠鑿井，振興農牧蠶桑，創辦機器織呢，採金四節，教育設施一章，又分書院，義學，印書，考試，四節，以上各章，都是政治工作，在當時可算得規模粗具，這種辦法，可算得改正了以前把西北問題視爲邊疆問題的成見，而正式視爲中國內部問題，左宗棠所以異於張騫班超者在此，秦君此書，也可算揭露了左宗棠的眞面目。</p>
<p>在中國歷史上，對於左氏應該重行評價，這是秦君著作的最大特色！而最後一章，左公經營西北的總檢討，更是秦君研究的心得，列舉國防武力的盛衰關係西北治亂，政治不能大成就的原因，繼任缺乏人才，國防的西北，國以民爲本，流亡的原因和結果，充實人口的要蒲，以及運輸的苦痛和需改進，建設西北須出中央決心並由國庫負担，自古障碍着西北建設的完成，大量和長距離遝轍交通工具的首要，政治淸明爲先決條件等重大問題，都是今後澈底解決西北問題的主要意見，所以這本書，不但是重建左宗棠的歷史地位，也是建設西北最寶貴的參考資料，值得向熱心研究西北問題的人們，作鄭重的介給。</p>
<h3>發展心理學</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>著者：左學禮</p>
<p>出版處：商務印書館（大學叢書）</p>
<p>出版期：三十五年六月</p>
<p>關於發展心理學的書籍，除何林華斯（H．L．Hollingworth）所著Mental　Growth　and。Decline一書的譯本（趙演譯）外，在國內出版界尚屬僅見。左學禮的這本新著，是她在國立西北師範學院編著的講稿。著者曾從富里門教授（F．N．Freeman）受學所採富氏的材料頗多。</p>
<p>凡是研究教育的，對於發展心理學這門學科實不容忽視。人生自胚胎以至衰老，爲一發展的過程，所以西洋教育學者如廓美紐斯（Comenius斐斯泰洛齊（Pestalzzi）盧梭（Rousseau）諸家所持的教育觀點均主張以兒童的自然發展爲根據，或以兒童心理發展的定律爲依歸。十八世紀自然主義的教育哲學更含有發展心理的觀念。近代復受進論化，兒童心理學，比較心理學的發達的影響，研究發展心理學更成爲普遍的趨勢。其實，豈僅研習教育的人需要這方面的知識，任何人爲了獲得修身養性的參證，也該明瞭人生發展過程的內容。</p>
<p>前五章泛論　以後依時期敘述</p>
<p>本書的問世在今日確有迫切的需要。無論從材料的搜集和編制上看，本書所述已足够使一般人尤其是研究教育的，獲得一個淸晰的基本觀念，並了解人生全部的發展過程。確如胡毅教授在序文中所說「分段論列均詳愼精到。」我覺得何林華斯之書，雖屬詳盡，但仍不免涉之瑣碎，對初學爲欲獲知發展心理的概念者，或不盡適宜，而左君的這本「發展心理學」允稱扼要簡當，最利初學。</p>
<p>全書共分十二章，前五章泛論一般的發展原理，自第六章起即依次述人生各時期發展的情形。茲分述各章要點如下：</p>
<p>第一章「導論」，敍說發展心理學之科學的背境和發展心理學之涵義及範圍，對發展的槪念敍述周詳，並示研究發展心理學的各種方法。</p>
<p>遺傳與環境　那一個決定性大</p>
<p>第二章「遺傳決定論及其批評」，著者對於高爾登（F．Galton）及推孟（L．M．Terman）的天才研究，皮爾遜（K．Pearson）的家人類似研究，桑戴克E.L.Thorndike）邁利門（C.　Werriman）候奚（N.D.Hirseh）的雙生子類似研究，末雷（H.G.Muller）的同卵　生子研究均有扼要的叙說，然後加以批許。</p>
<p>第三章「環境決定論及其批評」，主要的立論根據爲瓦德生（Watson）的行爲心理學派。該派是絕對的不妥協的環境決定論者。此外研究環境問題的人，大都並不完全否認心理遺傳，但提出後天環境對人類成就的重大影響的證據，以反證絕對的遺傳論。書中引述加德兒（J-Mek　Catteh）哥兒東（H.Gordon）斯托克（S.M.Stoke）富里門及霍昔宜（K.J.Holzinger）諸家的研究。作者的批評認爲遺傳的事實，非理論上的否認所能抹殺。遺傳和環境對人類心理的發展，實在是互爲影響的。</p>
<p>人生幾時期　心理發展的特徵</p>
<p>第四章「發展之一般特微與事實」，告訴我們發展是遺傳與環境二因素相互的及同時的作用之結果，它包括一個繼續不斷的過程。</p>
<p>第五章「種質與胎兒時期」，說明發展的生理基礎及決定卵細胞發展的因素和分期，並根據孟德爾（Mendal的遺傳律，討論種質問題。最後又說到身體機構及功能的兩個重要原則，即方向律（The　low　of　development　direction）和正側發展律（The　low　of　Cephalocandal　development）。胎兒的反應行爲和胎教亦有論及，</p>
<p>請注意兒童　行為心理的研究</p>
<p>第七章「學齡前的三年」，叙說自三歲以後智力發展的情形·關於社會態度和行爲的發展，提供了許多極可寶貴的材料。作者介紹布里奇（Pridges）的兒童社會行為發表，可作為改良兒童社會行為的發展之重要參考。</p>
<p>第八章「活動時期」，這是從六歲起的一個極重要的階段。兒童進入這個階段，活動範圍日廣，能力日增，要指導或控制他們的活動或行爲，首須明瞭他們行爲的動機。通帶的說到此時期兒童的興趣以及社會觀念道德觀一念的發展。</p>
<p>第九章「靑年時期」，將靑年期的發展特徵及意義，靑年期之生理的發展，情緒發展，社會關係的發展統統作了極詳盡的討論。書中指示靑年身心衛生，情緒修養以及性教育各方面的要點，尤其是父母和教師所當注意，靑年所當力行的。</p>
<p>五十歲以前　學習能力無退步</p>
<p>第十章「成人時期」，叙說二十歲以後身心發展的情形。作者綜合了各家的研究，而以桑戴克的成人學習的實騐爲主要根據，強調五十歲以前的學習能力並無顯著的退步。成人的情緒及社會行爲的發限和以前時期所有的差異，叙述得也很明晰。</p>
<p>最後第十一章「年期」，這是人生衰退的時期。不但生理衰退，智力及各種能力也都呈現衰退。此期的情緒和以前有關著的差異，由於心能錯誤，，最易患精神病。書中分析老年人患精紳病的原因，並列舉各種不同的精神病微象，最後提出心理衛生對於老年人特別重要，保障老年期的幸福和社會的效用，實在是值得注意的問題。</p>
<p>有益于修養　廣採實驗的結果</p>
<p>綜觀本書的優點，在簡明扼要，對各家學說能詳徵博引，搜羅無遺。而又能有裨人生修養，冶理論與實用於一爐。對所論及的各問題廣採新舊實驗研究而加以客觀的批評，不同於一家之見。其他生物學，人類學，倫理學，犯罪學等學科之與發展心理有關的文獻，亦均論及，可使研究者獲得整個連繫的概念。最後成人及老年兩章，搜集材料尤非易一事，因爲此階段一向少人研究，現成可資採用的資料不多，而左君却於此發抒很多獨特的見解。至於本書組織嚴謹，系統分明，在國內心理學著作中尚不多見。還有，因爲人生發展的各個階段是繼續不斷的，所以本書的叙述都能顧到各個階段的聯繫，（分章叙述只是爲了便利）前後一貫，這又是一個特點。</p>
<h3>商法概要</h3>
<p>— 羅庚生</p>
<p>著者：黃房言</p>
<p>承印：開明書局</p>
<p>代售處：上海市商會</p>
<p>綜計最近各書局的出版，很少有給商人閱讀的書籍，原因很簡單，因爲商人旣從事商業，沒有空餘的時間去看書。其實這種觀念是錯誤的！許多商人在業餘的時間，很願意吸收新的知識，而現在商人所以不看書的緣故，因爲目前這些書籍，不合他們的口味和需要。商人看書的目的和一般靑年學生不同，學生只顧到自己的興趣，而商人要求實用！</p>
<p>什麽是商人所需要的？這個問題很簡單，他們希望能够知道怎樣去交易和應付人事；更要知道國家是怎樣保護他們的商業，他們可以在保護下儘量的從事商業活動，不致有危險，這些都是商法上的問題。</p>
<p>自從各國通商以來，商務日漸繁複，這個時代，商人如果不具備一點商法常識，那麽他或許不能應付這個複雜的環境和意外的事情，因此而影響他商業的前途。這樣看來，商法與商人，很有密切的關係，商法的研討，也是商人所感到需要的！但是中國的商法，倣效瑞士民商合一的制度，商法的規定，多歸併在民法中，以致商人雖想研究，亦難以下手。最近有黃　言的商法概要一書，把商法概說無遺。商人與準備從事商業者，頗有一讀的價值。</p>
<p>全書共分七章，摘錄書中要　如下：</p>
<p>（一）商法之意義　從中國舊式商業情形，說到現在商法的重要，同時說明習慣，判例，與法條，爲商法之來源。</p>
<p>（二）契約　契約爲商法的主要科題，所以材料十分豐富，內分契約之種類，約因，要約與承諾，意思表示，行爲能力，契約應合法，意思一致，契約之效力，契約之解除，契約之解說十節。除了說明契約訂定的條件外，對於契約在法律上的效力，也有詳細的解釋。</p>
<p>（三）商業關係　包含代理人的種類和權限，合夥的形成和合夥人的責任，公司的種類和股東的職權等問題。</p>
<p>（四）貢賣　這是商業上最重要的行爲方式，也是一種非要式行爲的契約，一個商店，一家公司，都不能沒有買賣，買賣之中，問題很多，不懂法律的商人，或許隨時有發生麻煩周折的可能。</p>
<p>（五）物品運送　比買賣進一步的就是運送，運送的手續，保險，雙方的責任，這裏所購的，都可作爲商人的備忘錄。</p>
<p>（六）票據　現在商業塲所中流通的，都是票據。票據有匯票，支票，本票三種，各種票據的意義，流動和轉移的方式，出票人經手人的責任，也是現代商人必備的知識。</p>
<p>（七）海商法　海上物品運送，國外貿易，海員，船舶，船舶種撞，救助與撈救，共同海損，這些規定，也是進出口和船運商人必須熟悉的。</p>
<p>本書特點在理論和事實並重，每一理論，必附着事實作參考。本來法律不外理論，理論不外人情，人情也就是風土習慣，事實的結晶。這些事實並不是著者虛構，而是各國的判例，這樣可使讀者不但能得到法律理論的訓練，而且因事實的參考而可以得到實際的經騐。</p>

<h3>評「中國與美國」</h3>
<p>— 趙師傳</p>
<p>Chian　and　America,　By　Foster　	Rhea　Dules,　Princeton　University　Press,1946,277　pp.</p>
<p>西書之論中國對外關係史的，很有幾本名著？如H-B-Morse的The　Intermational　Relations　of　the　Chinse　Empire和Macnair的Far　Eastern　International　Relation-ms等。不過特別論述中美關係史的專書，據我所知，簡直沒有。由現在中美兩國關係的密切和複雜看起來，這不能不算是件憾事。杜爾斯這本「中國與美國」之出版，顯然彌補了這缺憾，因爲它是述叙中美關係史的。因此，我們頗覺此書之可貴。</p>
<p>本書自一七八四年美船初次來華貿易述起，至第二次大戰結束，馬紹爾將軍來華及政協閉幕止。全書注重於官方關係，對兩國通商情形，及宗教和文化的流通等，所談不多。然本書的好處也正在此：不專門，有興趣，簡潔，適合一般的讀者。</p>
<p>本書有一點值得提起的，是作者對中國的善意態度。作者在可能範圍內避免引用和作對中國不利的批評，我並不是說我們不願接受不利的批評，我覺得至少在作者的用心上說，是值得我們感激的。</p>
<p>作者曾坦白地承認美國人民對中國從前半殖民地的狀態，不能逃避責任。但他認爲那時「美國如放棄基於最建國條款的各種特權，這於中國不一定有利。這樣犧牲將早晚迫使美國退出遠東，而使中國更呻吟於西方帝國主義掌握之下。（六十八頁）</p>
<p>但無論如何，我們不能事認在中國對外關係史上美國是中國最友好的國家。這一點，作者在本書中特別強調。他除處處引用官方及民方的關於中美親善的言論外，並以事實證明。這裏我們不妨問問：美國為什麼特別對中國友好？我們覺得除因為美人富有正義感外，商業問題是最重要的原因。作者曾說「四萬萬顧客的潛在購買力，使（美國）對中國人民友善成為一件很值得的事。。」（一八八頁）</p>
<p>杜爾斯的這本書雖只是中美關係史的梗概，尙不失為一本學術性的著作。因此，作者把底註（Footnotes）省略，我們認為很是可惜。此外，書目（Bibliography）雖然相當好。但卻忽略了很多重要的著作。特別是上面所提到的HB-Morse博士的巨著未被列入，實為美中不足。</p>

<p>在那七月天，夏日鄉村寂寥的午畫，通港山的大路上，一株小小的蘋菓樹旁，樸實美麗的農家少女瑪婷和一們名呌茹速的靑年邂逅了，經過一些談話之後，原來這個剛打叙利亞退伍歸來的少年的兵，就是瑪婷的對門鄰居邁方老太太的孫子。他們彼此談得都很投機，不，不僅是投機，茹通覺得自己已經愛上港山了，雖然他仍是逗留在去港山的大路上。時刻已過了正晌午，他裝成個帶病負傷的兵，挽着瑪婷的胳膊向港山走去，就像是一對情人。半個月以後，邁方老太太在家不時和她的孫子談及一些關於娶親事情，老年人看重的是禮法，年靑的茹連可不在乎這個，他任性，只記得及時行樂，對於可憐的瑪婷，他雖然神魂顚倒，可也不過視作路柳牆花而已。但是後來，他跟珊娜訂婚了，她是他舊時的好友，一個有學識而又門戶相當的二十歲的姑娘。秋天來了，心的秋天也來了，路旁的小小蘋菓樹，已經落去它的靑校和綠葉，歡樂終結了，愛情凋謝了，十月天的薄暮，心碎的瑪婷坐在路旁，依依遐想，滕矓的眼剪的秋色，朦朧的過去的春夢，忠實的阿弗萊向她求婚，她全然不動，她只想着茹連，茹連，和珊娜訂了婚的茹連，他現在已經不在港山了，他還記得她麼？幾天功夫的談情說愛，在他是過眼雲烟，可是在這女孩子的單純的心裏，誰也想不到會留下多深的痕跡。可憐的瑪婷，茹連和珊娜結婚了，她不但得不着她所愛的人，並且常常被喚去安慰愛人的妻子，當茹速不在港山的時候，珊娜需要她的陪伴，因爲她覺得在瑪婷身上可以找着她自已的丈夫，似乎他已經在這少女身上留下他一點兒痕跡，就像在一冊他愛過的書上或是一隻玩過的小狗身上留下什麼似的；但是當茹速回來之後，他都覺得她是多餘的了。可憐的瑪婷。更可憐的是連這一點點苦中的溫馨也無緣消受，茹連和珊娜離開港山村，搬到別的地方去了。瑪婷在流够了悲哀的眼淚之談，她答應邁方老太太的勸，嫁給阿弗萊，她明白自己不但無福事受愛情的幸福，就連愛情的痛楚也都是沒有緣份的。一年之後，是殘冬的向晚，風光愁慘的黃昏，瑪婷和茹連再度相會，這時她已是阿弗萊的妻子，並且還有了身孕，邁方老太太已經逝世了，茹運回港山料理喪事，並售去祖母的那所屋子，他戲着孝，在那樸素的小農家中，看見一年前愛過幾天的女人，他忽然動了心，從前的賞心樂事……光彩……靑春……狂在歡之笑聲……眞半假的愛……全都記起來了。他感動的對瑪婷說了許多話，按理是可以不必再提的話，重溫一下舊情，沒有別的，這個自私的人，只是重溫一下舊情。瑪婷哭了，她費去多少時間和苦痛忍了許久的眼淚又爲他流下，這偶自私的人，他又跟她說了再會，可能是永久的再會，但也許不。然而，瑪婷的故事完了，瑪婷和茹連的故事完了……</p>
<p>沒有完的，是那留給人們的撲滅的慾望和綿延的苦惱，多少黯然和多少絕望，又多少低徊……</p>
<p>一個多麼平淡的故事，你會說。但是，它給人多麼不平淡的親切與眞實的感覺，你會體騐到。正像綿綿春雨的夜晚，聽得遠遠的笛聲奏着凄婉的「昭君怨」不會使得你哭，甚至流淚都不會，但長它會給你一種刻骨的悽凉，依依的惆悵。它不像美酒般的使人沉醉，却似淸茶般的給人無窮的回味。它是花的芳香，而不是花的顏色。它是輕描淡寫的中國山水，從頭到尾沒有驚人之筆，但每一　都是驚人的。</p>
<p>關於作者約翰·雅克·拜爾納（Gean-Gacques　Bernard）根據本書譯者序，我們知道他是喜劇家退斯當。拜爾納（TristanBernard）的長子，一八八八年七月三十日生於巴黎近郊，幼年消磨於巴黎，及長入巴黎大學，在一九三六年底已經問世的有二十幾部劇本和四五部小說，與勒瑙爾茫（H.R.Lenormand）同爲法國新戲劇的建設者和代表作家。「瑪婷」素有「模範劇」之佳譽。不追求怪誕的格式，反抗束轉性靈的慣例，他只在通常的格式中尋求獨創；正如譯者說的：「拜爾納所感覺的深，听吐露的少，所保持的則是趣味和貞潔……」</p>
<h3>憂患</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>人生隨筆之二</p>
<p>勃萊克Blake有一句時：「我所遇到的，每張臉上，都有着弱點和憂患的標記。」這句詩，正是我們眼前這境遇中人物的寫照，不問新知舊交，不問貧當老幼，也不問生活境况，每個人都帶着憂患的標記，「雖然不快樂的種類互異，但你總到處和它碰面。」（羅素語）</p>
<p>每一塲合都在那兒吵嘴，從滔樓，茶店，舞塲，戲院到擁擠的車廂，無時無刻不在吵嘴，眞是睚眦成仇，衣角碰了一下，那投擲的眼中之火，就像要吃掉你。向戲院去的看客，說是尋樂去的，幾乎每天看客和票房紅臉，看客和看客瞪眼，不時得當心成羣的不速之客衝入　　門，如臨大敵，得當心「城門失火」，戒爲被殃及的池魚。每一電車站，都像要發生大事變似的，一輛車子到來了，那人的洪流，衝鋒的衝鋒，爬窗的爬窗，踏了他的脚，概了她的孩子，總得鬧點事故來點綴那　悶污濁的車廂。從我們張開眼到深夜，所看到，聽到，碰到的就是這一類事。</p>
<p>伴着「苦悶」「煩躁」的噪聲，便是人性的另一面，一種猜忘嫉妬的心理，每一場合，都偈吃講茶似的，尖刀亮在袖底，他要　你。做掉你，總之，人與人的關係，都在鬥爭中消失，整個社會都變成了落馬湖，看誰的「利害」。</p>
<p>這樣，也「就無所謂信仰」，無所謂「中心思想」；你的教主踹在我的脚底，我的教主　在他的脚底；就是自己的教主，也只是一時的工具，只要有十三塊錢的好處，也就可以出賣。據說愛情是神聖的，這個世界的黃金早已褪了色，戀愛不過是一塲游戲。誠如羅馬史家吉本Grblon所說的歷史不過是記載人類的罪惡，愚蠢，和不幸的記錄。此外，一無所有！』</p>
<p>這是我們眞正的「憂患」，我們生於這樣的憂患之中。從前，我們還以爲皇皇不可終日的是「內憂外患」，現在我們明白了，我們實在生存在「心患」之中。我們誠如撒墨爾Samuel所說的，「我們是否甘心看着這個世界再度把它自己割爲犬仔，伊壁鳩魯和斯爲噶這三個派別呢？」噫，</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>畫符咒的軍服人</h3>
<p>— 幾幹</p>
<p>有一個穿着軍服身材高大的男子，被人控告姦污。他却自稱因見對方女子似有神經病，便將她帶至旅館，爲她治病。他這治病的秘方，據說是十年前從一老道學來：很多的符咒。推事當庭要他把符咒寫出，以覘其是否「眞實」。不料他竟然晝了一道符，而且還寫了幾句咒語，「赫赫陽陽，日出東方，弟子有請道長……」</p>
<p>對方女子據說是爲了「單相思」而變成「花癡」，這就已經够稱反常的了。而所遇到的男子，除了自供下部殘廢不能人道以外，還會畫符，還會騐咒，這些奇文凑在一起看了，眞令人有今日何世之感。</p>
<p>不久以前一個女扮男裝的老嫗，因為有猥褻旋詐欺吸毒的行為和嫌疑，被人稱為人妖。其實此區不過時一個罪犯（這看法院的判罪就可知道），眞正的妖怪，却在別個地方。</p>
<p>原來所謂妖者，不外兩種解釋：曰異，曰孽。一切怪異之物，都可以妖怪稱之。然而最主要的，還在於妖術的有無。有妖術的才能稱為妖，否則不過是一個怪。脾氣古怪的人稱之為怪人，形狀古怪的石頭稱之爲怪石，凡此皆不得視為嬌艷人或妖石。至於有一種人，用妖言惑衆，妖術迷人，自稱能未卜先知，且唸唸有詞，使人彷彿神仙降世，以至於用一切違反常識違反科學的方法來「指點迷津」者，這種人雖然衣冠起居一如常人，也得以妖稱之。進一步說，凡是相信此種妖術的人，自己必然染了妖氣，凡是隨時隨地都彷彿看見妖怪者，他必然戴了一副妖氣的眼鏡。因爲壓根兒的說來，這世界上根本沒有眞妖的存在。一種妖是裝神作怪，一種妖是疑神疑鬼而已。</p>
<p>我們試睜眼看看，這種妖有多少？何日賽先生在中國帶十萬勁旅，把這些妖氣一掃而空！此處筆者但願那畫符唸咒的軍服人，以至於看他畫符聽他唸咒的人們，儘管他當庭表演得「像煞有介事」，並不眞的「常伊有介事」。</p>
<h3>如何教導你的孩子</h3>
<p>— 夢麟譯</p>
<p>（三）蛾的蛻變</p>
<p>正像許多年輕而淘氣的孩子，我常常一逢到棘手的難事，便跑到媽媽那裏求帮忙，不過媽媽終是讓我一人自己去解決。我不僅她所以拒絕我的意思，一直等到有一天我看見一只蛾子正在它的繭穀裏跳動，好像喘氣的樣子。我自作聰明的呌了起來，開始拿出衣袋裏的小刀割破了繭殻，好讓蛾子容易些出來。媽媽回過頭來，看我動着手術。當我發覺蛾子並不會飛，大大地失望的時候，媽媽悟得了一個主意。</p>
<p>「孩子」，她說，「蛾子在穀中的掙扎是有用意的——使得它有力量可以振翼，飛離地面，不像往常親眷在地上爬了。你不讓它長足，所以現在它旣不會飛，又不會爬了。這跟孩子一樣，一個像你樣大的人，假如時時有人給他解決難題，便失去了發展的機會。如果我們用了自己的力量去解決每一個人生的鬥爭，那麽這就培養了我們去迎戰下一次的力量！」</p>
<p>（四）不能收回的東西</p>
<p>我的小妹妹喜曉舌，慣於將同伴間不確實的故事傳播開去，因此引起了許多次我們家庭和隣居間的不睦。實在她是不含惡意的，經過家人的責備後，她會得抱歉地說：「我設法把它們完全收回好了。」</p>
<p>普通的責罰已不能收效，媽媽記起了外婆教她的一個教訓。她吩咐我妹妹將一個羽絨枕芯拿到門外去割破了。然後媽媽說，「現在我要你將倒出來的羽絨全部再裝進裏面去。」</p>
<p>「不過那是不可能的！」妹妹說，「它們已經飛散到各處去了，」</p>
<p>「對啦！」媽媽回答，「它們正像你傳散開去的謠言，一旦被傳播開去，你便無法再把它們全部收轉了。」</p>
<p>現在，當我將要拿未經證實的謠言或閒談轉講給別人聽的時候，我馬上記起了媽媽給我妹妹的這一回教訓了。（譯自四月份讀者文摘）</p>
<h3>戰犯大川周明</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>以參與「九一八」事變罪被捕之戰犯，滿鐵東亞經濟局理事　大川周明，亦是和黑龍會，大生產黨　足而三的前「伸武會」會長。近以患第三期梅毒，兼以神經錯亂，遠東國際法庭已決定停止加以審判，而待其自斃。此爲受審戰犯出缺之第四人，前三人爲近衛（自殺），松罔與永野（庾死）。</p>
<p>假如我們不健忘的話，當可憶到去年五月三日國際法庭在東京開始審問日本戰犯時，大川所表演的一幕活劇。他首先解開自已的襯衫，欣然撫摩胸腹後，突然伸手打坐在其前面的東條，大川當時就被押出法庭送體檢騐。就說他的神經有些失常，現在始知他不但有神經病，而且有嚴重</p>
<p>大川有六十歲了，東京帝大印度哲學系畢業，著名的法學博土。可是却是法西斯主義的信徒，那些秘書法西斯團體的徒衆，都很崇拜他。他曾先後組織過猶存社，行地社，全日本愛國共同門學協議會等等的團體。他澈底主張「大陸急進論」所以和少壯軍人密切聯絡。一九三一年竟和橋本欣五郎圖謀　奪政權，後因軍部反對而作罷。但其後即池備與關東軍副參謀長板垣等在瀋陽發動事變。「瀋陽事變」爆發後，忙於組織「神武會」，本著所謂「神武建國精神」，以大東亞主義和改造日本政府爲宗旨。結集少壯軍人，行地社，生產黨等的人；且有實業家石原廣一郎的財當爲後，和軍部有聯絡。財力威勢爲法西斯團體之最，那時他完全是個澈底的　武思想家，較動侵略思想，其見解竟成爲　武者的信條。一九三三年日本「五一五」事變，他因供給資金及武器而被捕。次年保釋出後，後年神武會即解散。刑事部份被判刑四年，二二六事變後開始執行，於近衛內閣成立後保釋。他雖然後有明顯的直接參加侵略和事變的行動，但是在策動方面，鼓吹協助不遺餘力，所以遠東國際軍事法庭要加以逮捕，審訊其罪行，主要的是他參加了「九一八」事件的陰謀。</p>
<p>聞說他的學問是法士中的熟羣之鶴，日本罕有的蒙古型的面貌，舉動貴族化，從身材上看去很像一個外交家。可惜他竟誤入法西斯陣營，成爲一個可怕可恨的人。</p>

<p>甲男：我要找亡室去說一句話。</p>
<p>乙男：爲什麽？</p>

<h3>漁夫詞</h3>
<p>— 寗頗</p>
<p>「鱸魚肥，壺酒熱，扁舟一葉江上息；你道公侯樂，爭奈我漁夫，心淸如水。錢潔如雪，怎肯比那榨取民脂民靑民血。」</p>
<p>這首漁家樂的打油詞，不知爲何人所作，它的意思，是把漁人自力更生的貞操和專吸民膏貪婪的官吏，說得個明明白白。不過它可忘了今日在湖海中恃漁生活的漁民，恐怕是十個中找不出一有個有　魚肥，壺酒熱，這個福份吧！</p>

<h3>無形的垃圾</h3>
<p>— 阿林</p>
<p>有人刺意地說：上海是一個生產垃圾的都市。也許在此式微的經濟現狀下，拉圾眞是都市最大的生產品。因爲其他產業會停滯，會倒閉，而垃圾是四百萬市民普遍生產的，旣無工資問題，也不會有三百萬人之失業現象也。</p>
<p>在從前，法國人曾經把垃圾運去填滿洋涇浜，而今日則因無浜可填，於是祗有堆存街頭巷尾了。即使好容易船運事載表一部份，據說也是沉入黃浦江上流的。因此溶浦局也更忙了。</p>
<p>這幾天聽說當局決拼四億元經費，與每日四百萬磅生產品競爭，這倒大可令上海容光煥發一下的。祗是有形的垃圾尚可淸除，無形的垃圾却更值得注意。</p>
<p>這些無形的拉圾恒常堆滿在最沒有垃圾的所在，可是它比有形的垃圾，更有關環境衛生，它不但使人心糜爛，也使飢餓臨門，如果你無所感覺，那末請意會國際飯店屋頂四個霓虹大字，你就能發現這些無形的拉圾已經像火山鎔岩毀滅古代邦縣城一樣在把上海淹沒了。</p>
<p>所以，爲了在這被淹沒中救出生計，世道和人心，需要在清除有形的垃圾時，也同時淸除無形的拉圾。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>年少氣盛的熊處長倐地豎起眉毛，一個箭步衝到了司機台邊，一下先搶掉了那女人手裏的武器，跟着一使勁，就把肥豬似的一位周太太打車上直摔到地上，她那一對方頭黑牛皮鞋，也像長了翅膀似的從它們主人的足上飛起來，直竄到半空裏。</p>
<p>「混帳！看你這潑女人還凶不凶」？處長大人又起雙手，挺着腰，昂然地說。</p>
<p>那女人爽快地地上打起滾來，一路哭，一路罵，像打「醉八仙」似的把一大片青草都壓平了。</p>
<p>「侯局長，侯太太，快請上車」！劉連長也湊這個機會，趕過去把那胖女人所有的零星行李全丟了下來，回頭慌忙招呼那個中年人上車。</p>
<p>然而他們的動作還不够快。地下的那個胖女人已停止了打滾，突然一躍而起，發瘋似的猛撲上來；這時候，她臉上已滿沾了泥垢，加上眼淚鼻涕，輸得活像鄉下土廟裏供的泥神。熊處長瞧她來勢太凶，也不暇再顧自己的身份，忙迎上去劈面擱住。</p>
<p>「我跟你拼啊！」可是那女人竟一些不懼怕他，反乘勢把他扭了個結實，兩個人倒像是在練習　交似的。</p>
<p>年少的熊處長這一窘可眞不小，他差一些就想拔出手槍來，但終於勉强遏止住了；一兩分鐘之後，那胖女人臉上和身上的泥垢已一起揩到了他的草綠色的軍衣上去，跟着他的　　也給他揪下來了。瞧這　鬧的人眞有許多也像張昌那樣的一　　呌好的。</p>

<h3>The Council Holds Its First General Assembly; Zhang Qun Attends and Reports on Politics, Providing a Detailed Explanation of the Domestic and International Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan attended the first general assembly of the Political Council on the morning of the 21st to deliver a political report. His speech lasted eighty-five minutes. He received enthusiastic applause both when he stepped onto the podium and after he concluded his report. The assembly began at 9:00 AM with 204 council members in attendance. Fifty-nine written inquiries were submitted to Premier Zhang, along with numerous oral inquiries. The number of attendees who raised inquiries reached two-fifths of the total, demonstrating the council members' high level of concern for current political issues. Zhang Boling chaired the assembly, and the Secretariat reported on: (1) the current actual number of council members in this session, which is 362; (2) the fact that council members Chen Yuan, Xu Wending, Ma Tengyun, Ma Yi, Chen Xuanzhen, Dan Maoxin, Hu Shuhua, Liu Zhenru, Laming Yixi Chuchen, Situ Meitang, Zhou Suyuan, and Zhu Zhihong had requested leave due to personal matters or illness. Following this, the Standing Committee reported on its work and reviewed the government's implementation of various suggestions from the second general assembly of the fourth session. Secretary-General Shao Lizi gave a temporary report on the situation of meeting with student petitioners at 4:00 PM on the 20th. Zhang Qun began his report at 9:55 AM and concluded at 11:20 AM. Afterward, the 59 written inquiries were read aloud, taking a full hour. This concluded at 12:20 PM, and the 30 oral inquiries were rescheduled for the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Political Council held its second general assembly on the afternoon of the 21st. The enthusiastic oral questioning of Premier Zhang's political report by the council members was an unprecedented phenomenon in the Council's general assembly. The assembly started at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 7:30 PM, lasting four and a half hours. The entire time was almost entirely devoted to oral inquiries. Premier Zhang listened attentively and then gave a general response on the spot, which took fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Due to the political questioning, the agenda of the second general assembly of the Political Council on the afternoon of the 21st, originally scheduled for social and judicial administration reports, was changed to the afternoon of the 22nd. The morning of the 22nd was still reserved for foreign affairs reports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] In his political report to the Political Council, Premier Zhang first introduced the domestic and international situation and diplomatic policies since the victory. He then detailed the past negotiations for peace, stating that, up to the present day, the question was not whether or not to resume peace talks. If the Chinese Communists were willing to seek peace, the government was ready to negotiate at any time, but he hoped that the council members would contribute their ideas on how to make the Chinese Communists change their minds. Zhang also provided a detailed explanation of the current economic problems and declared that the Executive Yuan was currently studying an economic reform plan, hoping that the council members would contribute valuable opinions so that it could be implemented smoothly once adopted. Finally, Premier Zhang specifically raised the issue of the recent student protests, expressing the government's deep concern for the future of education and encouraging students to uphold the spirit of law-abidingness while enjoying the right to freedom, so as to cultivate a constitutional atmosphere. Zhang declared in his concluding remarks: "I am not a genius. At this difficult time, assuming the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, there is no possibility of a miracle appearing. I deeply feel the concern of failure, and I am determined to devote myself to the utmost and encourage myself together with the people of the country."</p>
<h3>Full Text of Zhang Qun's Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The original text of the political report delivered by Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan at the first meeting of the National Political Council on the morning of the 21st is as follows: Chairman, esteemed council members: The opening of this assembly coincides with the dawn of a new era for the nation, the end of the period of political tutelage, and the entry into the preparatory stage for constitutional government. After the National Assembly, which drafted the constitution, has completed its mission, and before the National Assembly implementing the constitution is formed, the National Political Council is currently the most representative body of public opinion. At this time, it is truly a great mission for your council to hold this assembly. The content of my report today is the process of the government reorganization and the focus of the government's administration in the future. I invite the esteemed council members to offer your unreserved guidance.</p>
<p>Domestic Politics</p>
<p>Before reporting on domestic politics, let us first review the international situation after the war. All countries in the world desire world peace and their own security after the war. However, because of the different levels of trust among the various parties in the world's peace-keeping mechanisms, the methods that each country adopts to safeguard its own security also differ. This difference in understanding and methods has given rise to contention between the victorious nations. The shared sentiment of the victorious countries, no matter how much they detest war, is the reason why successive international conferences have consistently failed to achieve harmony and unity. China is in this world environment. Our diplomatic policy is consistent: China is willing to live in harmony with all countries in the world. Even for countries that were enemies of ours during the war, we harbor no thoughts of revenge. In particular, we hope to strengthen our friendship and cooperation with the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, which joined hands with China during the war, to jointly safeguard world peace. We are willing to follow diplomatic channels to seek fair and reasonable solutions to all outstanding international issues. China upholds the UN Charter, faithfully fulfills treaty obligations, and respects the legitimate rights and interests of friendly countries. At the same time, it also has the firmest determination to maintain its own national sovereignty, independence, and international status. Furthermore, China's diplomatic policy not only seeks harmony and cooperation between China and friendly countries, but also seeks harmony and cooperation between friendly countries. From the standpoint of international morality, this is the case; from China's own interests, it should also be the case. However, the international influence that China's diplomatic policy can exert is entirely determined by the extent to which we rely on our own efforts. If we cannot establish ourselves, then China will not only be unable to proactively control the environment, but will instead be controlled by the environment. Therefore, the most important tasks for China after the end of the war are unification, democracy, peace, and reconstruction. In order to achieve these goals, the National Assembly formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China last December. After the assembly adjourned, the government immediately consulted with the parties participating in the National Assembly to reorganize the government and jointly prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. The method of reorganizing the government is still based on the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference's resolutions. The Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction remains the guiding principle for the administration of the reorganized government. However, because the Chinese Communist issue has not been resolved, the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, in fact, needs to be supplemented. The China Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Kuomintang, and social elites have all put forward their opinions. The result is that, based on the spirit of the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, twelve articles of the new government's administrative guidelines were jointly agreed upon (the articles are omitted). According to these guidelines, the National Government was reorganized last month, and the Executive Yuan was also reorganized accordingly. The foundation of the government has been expanded, and various parties participating in the National Assembly, as well as social elites, have jointly participated in the National Government Committee, becoming the highest decision-making body of the state. Its meetings are called the State Affairs Conference, and the Executive Yuan is responsible for executing the decisions of the National Government Committee. The new government's administrative guidelines that I have reported above have already been submitted to the Standing Committee of the government. Due to the situation at the time, they were implemented without being submitted to your council for discussion, which is regrettable. I hope that the assembly will understand and accept them.</p>
<p>Military Conflicts</p>
<p>Today's domestic military conflict can be said to be a problem that everyone is anxious about, but it has not been resolved to this day. During the past eight years of war in China, because we fought the strong with the weak, we had to concentrate all our strength to support the war. Although we did not completely ignore construction, these wartime constructions obviously could not compensate for the alarming consumption. The results of the eight-year war are obvious and everyone can say that there were economic and financial losses. What is relatively difficult to see, or what people are generally unwilling to openly admit, are the cultural and moral losses. From the government to the villages, the losses are equally serious.</p>
<p>The hope of the entire nation is that after the end of the war, we can have a longer period of rest and recuperation, so that we can recover from exhaustion and create a new life. Unfortunately, immediately after the end of the war, there was the unrest caused by the Communist Party, which has been continuing for a year and eight months now. Under such circumstances, all construction is out of the question. Chairman Chiang saw this point early on. As early as when Japan surrendered, he invited the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to Chongqing to discuss the grand plan for peaceful national reconstruction. The Shuang Shi (Double Tenth) Agreement summary resulted in a political consultative conference with the participation of all parties, which agreed on the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction. This can be said to be an important turning point in China's postwar situation. Regarding the process of the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Shao Lizi gave a detailed report at the fourth session of the fourth session of your council last March. The spirit of the agreement is: first, the nationalization of the military, the implementation of military reorganization, in order to unify the military organization and military orders; second, the democratization of politics, the implementation of separation of party and military and separation of military and civilian affairs, and the expansion of the government's foundation, the convening of the National Assembly, and the drafting of the Constitution. After the conference adjourned, the government immediately negotiated on the two issues of "restoring transportation" and "reorganizing the military." Last February, an agreement was reached on the rapid restoration of transportation in North and Central China and a plan on the reorganization of the military and the unified incorporation of the Chinese Communist forces into the National Army, stipulating implementation within eighteen months. Unexpectedly, the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference was first frustrated by the outbreak of war in the Northeast. Regarding this point, when the three-person conference negotiated and issued the order to cease conflict on January 10 last year, the government and the Chinese Communist Party had a written understanding, the original text of which was: "Section 2 of the aforementioned order to cease conflict does not affect the National Government's troops entering the nine provinces of the Northeast or being transferred within the nine provinces of the Northeast in order to restore Chinese sovereignty." However, when government troops were transported to the Northeast by rail or sea, the Chinese Communist troops obstructed them and, in mid-March, occupied various places in Liaobei that had already been taken over by the government, and attacked Sipingjie, Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar, all important cities. As for military reorganization, the government made efforts to downsize the military after the military reorganization plan was established, while the Chinese Communist Party expanded its military in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Before the government returned to Nanjing last May, the government was eager for the negotiation on expanding the government's foundation and the convening of the National Assembly to succeed as soon as possible. Because the Chinese Communist Party insisted on excessive demands, the negotiation did not yield results. After the government returned to Nanjing, negotiation was stalled for a time, but the government still spared no effort to continue to work with the greatest patience to break the deadlock. The National Assembly, originally scheduled to convene on May 5, was also postponed to accommodate the Chinese Communist Party. On June 7, the government again ordered the troops in the Northeast to cease fire for nearly ten days, hoping to give the Chinese Communist Party another opportunity to change course and fulfill the agreement, and then negotiated with the Chinese Communist Party on the three issues of completely stopping the conflict in the Northeast, restoring domestic transportation, and implementing the military reorganization plan. The government's plan was very specific, while the Chinese Communist Party adopted a vague and evasive attitude, creating extraneous complications, making it impossible for the negotiation to proceed. Therefore, the ceasefire order was extended for another eight days. During this second ceasefire period, the Chinese Communist Party took the opportunity to launch a full-scale offensive on the Shandong, Jinpu, and Jiaoji lines, and places such as Dezhou and Tai'an were successively captured. Under such circumstances, peaceful negotiation was naturally unable to progress, but instead fell into a very serious deadlock. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi Reports to the Political Council on the Meeting with Student Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the Political Council reported at the Political Council on the morning of the 21st regarding the meeting at the Political Council on the afternoon of the 20th with student representatives from the Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou areas who had come to petition. Shao said: At the time, he and Deputy Secretary-General Lei met with the representatives, and there were also personnel from the General Affairs and Security Groups of the Council present. He accepted the students' written opinions. They had a total of five demands. He explained and interpreted one of them, namely that all schools above the vocational level should uniformly enjoy publicly funded treatment. He believed that this demand was not only difficult to achieve, but also unreasonable. Regarding the student petition, he told them that if students petitioned with reasonable demands, the government would consider them. However, he hoped that yesterday's unfortunate incident would be the last. At the same time, he hoped that lessons could be learned from the unfortunate incident, but not that the petition should be the last time. Finally, the student representatives stated that the military police were preventing them from advancing or retreating, and requested that a way be found to resolve the route back to school. He replied that the military police were preventing the students from advancing, but if the students were willing to return to school, there would be no reason to prevent them. After negotiations, they withdrew. Regarding the injured students, Shao also presented an investigation report, stating that only Sun Aoqun was seriously injured, with a broken leg, but there was no danger to his life, and doctors were trying to save his entire leg. More than ten other people had minor injuries.</p>

<h3>Political Council Jottings</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Zhang Ming</p>
<p>When Premier Zhang finished his report on the morning of the 21st, he said, "I am not a genius and cannot create miracles." Xu Deheng also mentioned during his questioning in the afternoon that "Premier Zhang is not a god." It seems that national affairs cannot be solved without creating miracles, but "everything depends on human effort." In Huang Yuren's questioning, he mentioned, "Our Premier also serves as the Vice Chairman of the Four United Relief Agencies. Why does a Premier have to serve as a vice chairman?" Huang Yuren was the first to stand up during the oral questioning. Those in the audience said, "The cannon has fired its first shot."</p>
<p>The chairman in the afternoon was Dr. Wu Yifang. Wu wore a black coat and a white scarf, looking like a judge.</p>
<p>Throughout the afternoon, Kong Geng sat on the presidium dais firing volleys of questions. He didn't care and only came down at the end to listen to Premier Zhang's reply.</p>
<p>Han Zhaoyu's call for his allies in the Democratic League was undoubtedly tinged with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>There was a burst of warm applause in the meeting to pay tribute to the Taiwanese council members who were attending the Political Council for the first time.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming's voice and vocabulary undoubtedly resembled a preacher, repeatedly saying "confession" and "reflection." On the stage was the black-clad Dr. Wu, and below the stage was Bishop Yu Bin. Wouldn't you want to shout "Amen" when you heard them?</p>
<p>The student petition was naturally a matter of concern, and Shao Lizi's report was usually welcomed, but it was not timely. Because everyone was eager to hear the political report, Pan Tongru issued an urging order, hoping to speed it up. Shao said, "I'll be done soon," with a great attitude.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun reported on the government reorganization and the military conflict for a long time, and Liang Shuming and others listened with their eyes closed.</p>
<p>Xiao Tongzi and Xu Xiaoyan sat in the last row of the press gallery, looking very friendly.</p>
<p>Chuan Laosian, who is about to go abroad to treat his high blood pressure, arrived late today and walked around all the seats with flickering eyes, unable to find his seat. Finally, the meeting affairs staff led him in a large circle before he sat down.</p>
<p>When Zhang Qun's report reached the financial and economic sections, many people perked up, but what they heard were "serious stage," "budget exceeded," "economic crisis," "can only set an example," "prices will rise again"… "How can this be?" problems.</p>
<p>One gentleman mentioned in his written questioning, "What are the standards for social elites? What can one do to become a social elite?" Everyone couldn't help but laugh. Written inquiries were being sent up one after another. There were two readers, one reading ten inquiries each, taking turns. Each change of readers startled the people below. When the fiftieth inquiry was read, there was a commotion in the audience, who thought it was necessary to end the reading of written inquiries and proceed with oral inquiries. However, Shao explained that the written inquiries had to be read because they were originally written inquiries to temporarily replace oral ones in order to save time. If they were not read, they would be repeated.</p>
<h3>Government Carefully Studying Outstanding Military, Political, Economic, and Educational Issues; Premier Zhang Answers Inquiries at the Second Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At the second general assembly of the Political Council on the afternoon of the 21st, a total of 197 council members were in attendance. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yifang. After the meeting began, oral inquiries on the political report began. After a break, a total of 36 council members spoke, with the focus of their inquiries being on calling for peace and reviewing the implementation of the new government's administrative guidelines. In addition, there were also inquiries about the conflict between students and military police.</p>
<p>Zhang replied briefly: At present, whether in military affairs, politics, economics, or education, there are countless problems waiting to be solved. The government is carefully studying them. I have only been in office for four weeks, and I have not yet fully understood some specific issues. I am very grateful to the gentlemen for informing me. As for the temporary measures for maintaining social order passed by the State Council on the 18th, they are based on Article 23 of the Constitution being implemented, which stipulates that emergency measures may be taken to maintain social order and in times of economic crisis. At the same time, martial law can be implemented for student petitions. However, in order to avoid the use of force, the procedures and legal formalities for petitions are first stipulated. Before the measures were announced, student petitions had already occurred in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and there were incidents of obstructing traffic and interfering with official duties. The government must carefully consider how to handle the unfortunate incident that occurred in the capital yesterday. Zhang then responded to the issue of peace, saying: "I believe that the questions asked by the gentlemen, 'When can we have peace, and what methods can be used to achieve peace?' are very important. We can consider them carefully, but due to time constraints, can we hold a forum at a later date to discuss and decide together?" Zhang also said: He sets aside an hour and a half each day to work at the Political Council, exchange opinions with Council members from various places who come to Nanjing, and prepare to answer questions.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Inquiries by Council Members Unseen in Previous Assemblies</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] After Premier Zhang Qun delivered a political report at the first general assembly of the Political Council on the morning of the 21st, the council members began to raise written and oral inquiries, reaching a total of 102, taking up more than five hours in total. This situation was unprecedented in previous sessions of the Political Council. Among the inquiries made by the council members, the most concerning issues were peace and unification, student unrest, labor unrest, corrupt officials, requisition and purchase of goods, bureaucratic capitalism, the current economic crisis, the new government's administrative guidelines, subsidy policies, balancing the budget, protecting human rights, separation of military and civilian affairs, and border areas. Council members from the north provided detailed descriptions of the current suffering of the people in the northern provinces, hoping to find a solution as soon as possible. Council members from the Northeast believed that the government should quickly seek to improve the method of purchasing soybeans at low prices and selling cloth at high prices in the Northeast. Regarding the issue of peace and unification, many council members spoke on this topic, with most believing that the current situation has reached a most critical juncture, and that peace and unification are desired by all the people. However, the methods to achieve peace and unification should be carefully discussed to ensure effectiveness. Liang Shuming believed that the government and the Communist Party should both reflect on their actions and discuss them in good faith to seek a path to peace. Those who spoke today included Wang Yaming, Han Hanshen, Pan Chaoying, Xiao Yishan, Huang Yanpei, Xu Deheng, Kong Geng, Shen Zhijing, Gu Gengye, Liang Shuming, He Baoren, etc. After Taiwanese council member Lin Zhong spoke, all the council members applauded to welcome him. After the inquiries were completed, Premier Zhang gave a comprehensive reply.</p>
<h3>People Have the Right to Petition, but Cannot Disrupt Order; Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The News Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 21st. Director Dong Xiangguang answered the reporters' questions as follows: Question: Can the freedom of the people stipulated in the Constitution be considered to have been implemented in this transitional period in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution? Do the Constitution and other laws implementing the Constitution have provisions to protect the right of the people to demonstrate?</p>
<p>Answer: The Constitution will be formally implemented on December 25th of this year. During this transitional stage in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution, the government has repeatedly stated that it will earnestly protect the various freedoms of the people. Article 10 of the government's administrative guidelines promulgated by the National Government on April 18 stipulates strict protection of the people's freedom of body, freedom of speech and publication, and freedom of assembly and association, and strictly prohibits illegal arrests and interference. Any restrictions that must be imposed in order to maintain social order and avoid emergency dangers must be approved by the National Government Committee. The Constitution and the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage only stipulate that the people have the right to petition, but only if it does not harm the people's freedom, social order, and public interest.</p>
<p>Question: Can the order announced by the government on the 19th be interpreted as prohibiting any demonstrations and parades by students, or only those that disrupt public order?</p>
<p>Answer: The recent student movement has unfortunately been exploited by those with political intentions, leading to the disruption of social order and public interest. The government specially promulgated measures to maintain social order on May 19 in accordance with Article 10 of the administrative guidelines. When people's organizations petition, they should send representatives to the competent authorities to express their opinions. The number of representatives is limited to ten. There must be no gathering of crowds to threaten, march, demonstrate, or other acts that disturb public safety.</p>
<h3>Publication of the Cost of Living Index Resumed in Various Places</h3>
<p>Question: Has a decision been made to resume the monthly publication of the cost of living index?</p>
<p>Answer: The cost of living index in various places is now being continuously compiled and publicly published by the competent authorities in various places on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Question: Are there any plans to change the value of the national currency? Is the government's policy to maintain the current exchange rate of 12,000 yuan of legal tender to one US dollar?</p>
<p>Answer: As far as I know, the government has no plans to change the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>Question: Is it in accordance with Chinese law for foreign enterprises in China to demand payment in US dollars? Are there exceptional preferential provisions in the law for semi-military American enterprises such as ATC (Air Transport Command)?</p>
<p>Answer: According to Article 5 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency in the Economic Emergency Measures Program, (foreign nationals or institutions shall not use their foreign currency to pay salaries or for other purposes), there are no exceptions.</p>

<h3>US Economic Aid to China Seeks a Reasonable Path: Marshall's Remarks to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] US Secretary of State Marshall discussed the situation in China and the proposed US $500 million loan at a press conference today. He made the comments when a reporter from the Communist newspaper "Daily Worker" asked whether the State Department was considering an early disbursement of the Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China. Secretary Marshall said: The State Department is paying close attention to the situation in China. The US government is striving to find a path that both Congress and the American people consider reasonable to aid China. He said that we expect the reorganization of the Chinese government, and the reorganization of the Chinese government has already been announced. Marshall pointed out in a serious tone that the United States sincerely wishes to assist China on a practical basis, but he could not specify what actions could be taken to make this assistance reasonable. Marshall consistently avoided directly answering the $500 million loan question first raised by the "Daily Worker" reporter when discussing matters concerning China. He finally stated that he could not reveal what actions the US government might take but reiterated that the government is very concerned with finding ways to help stabilize the situation in the Far East.</p>

<h3>National Army in Changchun Launches Outward Attacks; Actively Preparing for Defensive Warfare in the City; Xiong Shihui and Wang Shuming Fly to Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch of the 21st] The National Army in Changchun launched attacks this morning, searching for Communist troops in the surrounding areas. To the south, they have reached Yinjia Youfang, 30 li from the city, and to the west, they have cleared the area west of the airfield. To expand the battle results, they are currently waiting to join forces with the National Army advancing from the north. It was previously reported that Gongzhuling was recovered yesterday, but the military has not yet confirmed it. (Another Dispatch) Preparations for the defensive battle in Changchun are actively underway. In addition to strict deployment of posts in all important locations in the city, several fortifications have been constructed. Compared to the defensive battle in Changchun last year, the defenses are now much more stringent. Foreign diplomats from the US, Britain, and other countries have all designated safe areas for concentration. From last night until noon, the general situation was much quieter than the previous night. There are no Communist troops within ten li of the city. However, it is believed that this may be brewing a new situation, but it will not affect the safety of Changchun because the defending troops have strong confidence, and many young citizens have voluntarily organized groups to protect their homeland.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The battle situation in Changchun is temporarily easing. Communist troops fleeing into the suburbs are still harassing from time to time, but their range is now limited to the west and southwest, with traces of Communist troops in those directions only. The rest have retreated. There has only been contact between outposts in the past twelve hours. Whether there will be a major battle in the future will depend on the direction of the Communist troops' main force. Reinforcements from the National Army have indeed advanced north from Siping, so the decisive battle location may also be on the north bank of the Dongliao River and near Gongzhuling.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] More than 10,000 troops from Zhou Baozhong's Communist forces captured Wulajie north of Jilin City at 2 AM on the 20th.

However, the National Army is heavily fortified, and passenger trains on the Jilin-Changchun line were temporarily suspended yesterday but have resumed today. Meihekou is under siege and appealing for help. The Yunhe train station between Siping and Meihekou was invaded by Communist troops yesterday. Traffic on the Shenyang-Jilin line has been interrupted for two weeks, and fighting along the line has not stopped.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 21st] The Communist forces who launched a heavy attack on Gongzhuling on the 19th are now being surrounded and annihilated by the National Army advancing from the north, south, and west. Another National Army force briefly entered the city of Huaide County on the 20th. The National Army is now approaching the Fanjia Tun train station in the northern part of Gongzhuling along the Chaoyangpo (25 li west of Gongzhuling) and Helinzi (40 li northwest of Gongzhuling) highways, forming a fan-shaped encirclement of the Communist-occupied Daling. (Another Dispatch) At around 2 AM this morning, the Jingshui Chang area in the southern suburbs was harassed by a few hundred Communist troops, who were then driven back by the National Army. Other than that, the four suburbs are peaceful, and the atmosphere in the city has also eased. The streetcars, which had been temporarily suspended yesterday, have now resumed operation.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 21st] The siege of Faku has been lifted, and the Communist troops have retreated to the Kangping area, but telecommunications between Shenyang and Faku have not yet been restored. The weather cleared today, and the air force here has been operating all day, greatly assisting the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Xiong Shihui flew back to Shenyang from Nanjing at 4 PM on the 21st. Wang Shuming also flew in.

<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch of the 1st] The Communist forces in Shandong gathered ten columns of troops this time, launching an all-out assault on the area east of the Xintai-Mengyin-Qingtuosi highway in the Yi Meng Mountain area. After a strong counterattack by the National Army and seven days and nights of bloody fighting, the Communist forces were defeated again on the 19th due to heavy casualties and retreated in various directions towards Ju County, Yishui, and Tanbu. The National Army is currently pursuing and annihilating them. On the 20th, the National Army continued to launch a large-scale sweep in the long and narrow area east of Huangdou Mountain, Ding Mountain, and Ju Mountain, east of the Meng Qing highway, and west of the Wen River, and completely recovered the highway and important strongholds between Xiazhuang and Daguantun, 10 kilometers east of Duozhuang, and between Mashan and Heiyuzi.

The last one is the majority. Tsinghua President Mei Yiqi went to the city yesterday to meet with Hu Shi and, after returning to the school, summoned student representatives to lecture them, telling them that classes should resume immediately.

(Note from the reporter: The Garrison Headquarters has accepted the request to be responsible for medical expenses. As for the compensation, as there were no deaths, the request is not valid.

<h3>Communist Conspiracy Becomes Overt; Plotting to Organize a Suicide Squad to Expand the Student Movement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the student movement has surged, causing social unrest. The situation has evolved to the point that the instigation by the Communist Party and its periphery has become overt. It is learned that the Communist Party is now launching the so-called "June 2nd National General Strike, General Work Strike, and General School Strike" movement, attempting to take advantage of this student movement to expand it and create a bloody tragedy, intentionally creating a state of social chaos and unrest. Of the thirty student representatives from Shanghai who went to Nanjing to petition, eight returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the remaining representatives will return within two or three days. It is learned that after receiving this news, the Communist Party will prepare to launch another conspiracy, that is, they plan to take advantage of the return of the student representatives to Shanghai and secretly use the students again, under the pretext of "welcoming" them to the North Station. At the same time, there will be an organization of a "suicide squad" preparing to mix in among them, deliberately causing bloodshed incidents to expand the situation and achieve their political conspiracy. It is learned that most students in various schools have adopted a cautious attitude, avoiding unnecessary sacrifices, because they realize that this student movement has been altered.</p>
<h3>Those Who Orchestrate the Beiping Student Movement Have "Capital" and Spent Two Billion Yuan to Call for "Anti-Hunger"</h3>
<p>An Episode of the Beiping Student Movement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] A portion of the universities here were incited to hold their so-called "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War" march. Fortunately, due to the effective defense of the police officers in charge of security, no major unfortunate incidents occurred. According to observers familiar with the inside story: the student movement here may come to an end. Here are a few excerpts of the episodes related to the march: (1) The marching column was largely advocating "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War." More than 2,000 students participated, most of them from Tsinghua University, about 400. More than 300 students from the school who participated in this student movement went to the city a few days ago and stayed in Peking University to plan the relevant work. After yesterday's march, Peking University hired more than ten cars to send this group of "guests" out of the city to fulfill the "host's" friendship. (2) Before marching into the city today, students from outside the city went to Fu Jen Catholic University to ask for helpers. The students of the school did not agree, so there was a conflict inside and outside the school. As a result, 30 students were forcibly pulled away to participate in the march. (3) Several people from Sino-French University participated in the march. President Li Linyu did not know about it beforehand. (4) While the students were marching, the reporter met with Xu Peikun, the president of the Railway Institute, in the morning and asked for his opinion on this student movement. Xu said: If the authorities and faculty of the schools have a unanimous opinion, the student movement can be resolved. Xu continued: Taking the Railway Institute as an example, issues such as the relocation of the Air Force Factory and the restoration of the name of Jiaotong University are not problematic, so they will not be the cause of the strike. The reporter then asked whether the opinions of the authorities of the schools could be unanimous. Xu was silent. (5) The scenic area of Beiping is the area around the Three Gates in front of Tiananmen, where red walls and green tiles reflect each other. The prosperous area of Beiping is the Dongsi and Xidan Archways. When the marching students passed through these places today, they used tar brushes to smear many glaring and reactionary slogans and cartoons on the red walls. The shops and walls were most painted where there was beauty. Some students even climbed onto the Dongsi Archway with their ability to fly up walls and smear tar slogans, a step further than writing slogans with chalk on the street the other day. Because the tar is difficult to wash off, passersby lamented, and an old man admired this kind of work at the Three Gates and sighed, saying: The former Cultural Relics Committee spent 600 million to renovate, and today the students, with tar brushes, destroyed its neat beauty in a moment. In the future, it will be renovated again and money will be spent again. Anyway, the common people are unlucky! (6) According to people familiar with the inside story of the student movement: The planners of this student movement have complete plans and strong capital. In terms of propaganda, excluding the temporary smearing of slogans on the street: the number of various propaganda materials printed is very large, and the paper is exquisite. Even the street wall newspapers, each costing 10,000, require several million. The organization that manages the propaganda department prints and distributes news releases and other temporary notices every day. The number of mimeograph machines dedicated to this purpose is as many as eight. In terms of transportation costs, the number of cars used for meetings everywhere every day, together with the cars used for the march today, and the cars used by Tsinghua and Yenching students to travel back and forth, is alarming. The 300 students of Tsinghua who live in Peking University spend more than 10 million on three meals a day for three days. According to incomplete estimates: the capital invested by the conspirators in this Beiping student movement is more than 200 million yuan. No wonder a reader of a wall newspaper shook his head and sighed: It's ridiculous to spend so much money and still call oneself hungry. (7) The organizers of the march pulled students from middle schools. The principal of Mu Bei Girls' High School said to the students in the school: It is a fact that people are eating the worst now, but there is no fundamental hunger problem. One goes, one is expelled, all go, the school closes, don't be fooled by them. The students suddenly realized and attended class safely.</p>
<h3>The Supervisory Yuan Dispatches Personnel to Investigate and Handle the Student Movement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Supervisory Yuan paid close attention to the conflict between students and police during the march and petition in Nanjing on the 20th. The Supervisory Yuan immediately sent Gu Fengxiang, Wang Shuzeng, and Yang Nairu to the relevant agencies to investigate and handle the process of the student march and petition and the handling of the situation.</p>
<h3>All Sectors of Beiping Hold a Purge-the-Traitors Movement Rally</h3>
<p>Petition the Northwest Headquarters to Quickly End the Civil War</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] All sectors of the city held a Purge-the-Traitors Movement to Restore Peace Rally at Taihe Palace at 3 PM on the 20th. More than 20,000 people attended, chaired by the four organizations of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Trade Union, and Education Association. They separately lectured on the true meaning of purging the traitors, announced the ironclad evidence of the Communist Party's disaster to the country and the people, and passed a declaration of the conference on the spot. Zhang Bingzhou and 27 others were elected as representatives to petition the Northwest Headquarters to quickly end the civil war to secure the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Severe Food Shortage in Suiyuan Province; Launching a Production Increase Campaign</h3>
<p>[Our Guihua Dispatch of the 21st] Not many counties in Suiyuan Province planted crops this spring. It is now time to plant autumn crops, but it is difficult for the people to plant a lot due to the lack of manpower and livestock. The grain-producing area in western Suiyuan has suffered a severe food shortage, and the Suiyuan Provincial Government is actively launching an expanded production increase campaign.</p>
<h3>The Far Eastern Commission Passes a Policy on the Distribution of Reparations: Based on the Extent of Devastation by Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The reporter learned today: The Far Eastern Commission has adopted the following policy on the distribution of reparations from Japan, that is, this distribution should be based on the extent of devastation suffered by each country due to Japan's ravages and the extent of its contribution to defeating Japan. The Commission passed a policy on May 8th, deciding that the amount of reparations from Japan received by individual countries should be determined by a "broad political basis", that is, in addition to the above two considerations, the scope and time of the country's resistance to Japanese aggression should also be considered. The Commission also passed various policies related to Japan's imports and exports. Japan's export goods may only be approved under the following circumstances, that is, the importing country must agree to exchange them for Japan's needed imports or agree to pay for the export goods in useful or convertible foreign exchange. In deciding on the source of Japan's imports, the Commission also agreed that the basic goal should be to minimize the cost and difficulty of handling these imports, while also considering the price conditions at the time of purchase and the various guarantees that the goods must be delivered to Japan in a timely manner. However, under any circumstances, the Allied Commercial Commission may propose individual handling of various import and export goods.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission is seeking to reconcile the differences in distribution ratios. It is said that the United States requires the largest share, but not for its own use, but to cede it to countries such as Korea and the Philippines. China requires 40% of the Japanese assets allocated for reparations, and the Philippines requires about 15%, while other countries require smaller amounts. The decisions of the Far Eastern Commission have instructed MacArthur to handle the matter as he sees fit.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Assemblyman Zou Wu Assassinated</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch of the 20th] While the second congress of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly was in progress, an assassination of a provincial assemblyman occurred suddenly on the morning of the 20th. The assemblyman's name was Zou Wu, and he was the provincial assemblyman from Lianjiang County. At 8:30 AM this morning, just as he was about to go to the Assembly, while walking along Wende Road, he was suddenly shot from behind by two thugs wearing yellow Zhongshan suits. Two shots pierced his chest, killing him on the spot, and injuring a passerby. The murderers then fled, and the cause is unknown. The deceased was from Lianjiang, 65 years old. He served as the commander of the civilian army in the early years of the Republic of China. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, he served as the magistrate of Lianjiang and Suixi counties successively. At the time of his death, he was still wearing the Provincial Assembly's 34th attendance certificate and the Guangdong Provincial Government's 31st badge. After the incident, Chairman Luo personally sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate. The Headquarters and the Security Command Police Department have strictly ordered their subordinates to solve the case within a time limit.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stability and Suppression of Rebellion</h3>
<p>Social phenomena are becoming increasingly turbulent, and the people of the entire nation feel a growing need for stability. This is like a patient who is about to go mad with fever; the doctor must first use medication to reduce the heat and stop the agitation. Today, China's political situation and social phenomena are so chaotic and turbulent that they are almost impossible to unravel, but precisely because of this, voices calling for stability are coming from all directions.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang said in his speech to the National Political Council the day before yesterday, "...in order to seek stability for the nation and society..." Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan also advised students, "...in today's situation where the government urgently needs stability..." These are all expressions of the government's pursuit of stability.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and various legal entities jointly sent a telegram yesterday, advising students to "seek educational progress through stability." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also advised university students to "stabilize society by stabilizing schools." Various circles in Peiping even held a major rally to eliminate traitors, petitioning for the swift suppression of internal disorder to secure the people's livelihood. These are all appeals from the people for stability.</p>
<p>Stability, stability, in today's China, seems to be the most fundamental prerequisite for all construction and all work. Instability only leads to more chaos, and if the turmoil continues, there will be a day of great disorder. The people's path to survival today is becoming increasingly narrow, almost to the point of despair. How can we allow the country to sink further into the abyss of turmoil? Therefore, today's situation in China, although seemingly difficult and confusing, is actually very simple if we grasp the key point: that is, whoever can quickly bring the country into a state of stability at this time, the people will certainly welcome them with food and drink and pray for them with incense. Whoever still intends to undermine the overall situation, causing the country to move from instability to even greater chaos, the people will surely detest and abhor them.</p>
<p>So, how can we achieve stability today? Those who only scratch the surface will inevitably raise the issue of "opposing civil war" as the answer, meaning that if the civil war is stopped, peace and stability can be immediately achieved. In reality, if we think deeply, even if the term "civil war" is valid, we should ask why there is a civil war in the first place. The government certainly spends national funds on military operations, but if there were no Communists who betray the nation, deny the constitution, and resist the government, relying on their troops to create trouble, then how could the "civil war" arise? Therefore, the civil war is caused by the Communists, and the illegal activities of the Communists in China are the yeast of instability today. Because the Communists, in the process of seizing power, use the destruction of social order and the creation of chaotic phenomena as their only means, it is impossible to achieve the reasonable desire for stability with the illegal activities of the Communists. Once we recognize this point, if we truly want to achieve stability, it will not be difficult to prescribe the right medicine.</p>
<p>We believe that to achieve stability, we must first establish order before we can achieve peace. How can we establish order? The Great Learning says, "Knowing where to stop, then one can be composed"; Mencius said, "Being one with principle." There is absolutely no way that something without a central anchor, swaying and moving, hesitating and pacing, delaying and considering, can be expected to be "composed"! As the ancients said well: "Indecision leads to disorder." Why does indecision occur? It is because one cannot be composed, because one cannot "transform" into "one." The so-called "stopping" and the so-called "one," in simple terms, mean that the person in charge should first have a clear belief, a firm belief, never turning back in the face of difficulties, sacrificing life for it, preferring to seek right and wrong, merits and demerits, in the eyes of future generations, and not be swayed by the clamor of temporary public opinion. Here, we dare to represent the people in respectfully asking the government authorities and members of the National Political Council a question: "What attitude do you take towards the Communists who resist the constitution and create disorder, and their troops?" Please give a decisive answer, and not an ambiguous or evasive one. If you believe that the Communist Party's style of denying the constitution, denying agreements with the National Government, and even resorting to armed rebellion is correct, then you should simply and happily cease fighting, voluntarily hand over power, and let the Communist Party do whatever it wants. Why continue to let the soldiers on the front lines fight? If you still claim to respect the constitution, still do not want to overthrow the government, and still think of the people who have suffered from the Communist Party's long-term disorder and want to relieve them, then the way to seek stability at this time is definitely not to repeat the old tune of "peace talks," but to repent of the past, thoroughly correct previous mistakes, and concentrate all efforts on suppressing the rebellion. Only by quickly suppressing the rebellion can we stabilize the overall situation. If we still engage in suppressing bandits on one hand and singing the praises of peace talks on the other, profess the rule of law on one hand and condone evil on the other, hesitating and doubting, unable to make up our minds, still leaving the people and the soldiers on the front lines confused, then even our own spirit will lack composure. How can we stabilize the overall situation and reassure the people? "If the medicine does not cause dizziness, the disease will not be cured"; today, it seems that the time is approaching when we must take the dizzying medicine.</p>
<h3>Purchase Policy for Export Commodities</h3>
<p>It has recently been reported that the government has established a purchase plan for export goods, to be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. If this is true, it can be said to be a new economic measure with some significance.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the emergency economic measures on February 17, and the subsequent extension of the US dollar exchange rate to 12,000 yuan, the export market has temporarily shown signs of activity. However, due to excessive speculation, market prices have risen higher and higher, with most rising above the overseas selling prices. This has rendered the exchange rate adjustment ineffective, and the export of domestic products remains blocked. The situation of import surplus has not changed either. Consequently, the depletion of foreign exchange funds, the difficulties of exporters, and the suffering of producers and processors are deepening day by day. Even if the government tries to promote exports, the situation does not improve. As for the stagnation of funds, the high interest rates, warehouse rent, insurance, labor, and other increased costs, they are even more of a concern. If these situations continue for a long time without timely remedy, not only will producers and processors reduce their interest in continuing production due to blocked sales channels, but also all middlemen such as transporters, vendors, exporters, and even speculators will lose interest due to stagnant funds and lack of profit. Under these circumstances, how can production be increased? How can foreign exchange be earned? How can the unemployed population be reduced? At the beginning of the implementation of the measures to promote exports, this newspaper once wrote an article pointing out the need to implement purchases simultaneously. The viewpoint lies precisely in this.</p>
<p>Although starting to purchase now is generally less favorable due to higher prices and slower sales channels, it is still not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. We sincerely hope that the report is true and that it will quickly become a reality.</p>
<p>However, the government's purchase of export goods is certainly not for temporary profits, but to save export trade. In terms of its nature, it is more like relief than profit-seeking. Even if there is an intention to profit, it is to seek long-term overall benefits, not temporary partial small benefits. In other words, this move is based on the overall national economy and is definitely not to seek temporary small benefits in finance or business. Therefore, the vision must be far-sighted, and the plan must be broad. Before and after the war, there were many similar cases in various countries, such as Japan's purchase of raw silk, Brazil's purchase of coffee, and the United States' purchase of wheat. Not only did they buy high and sell low, clearly losing money, but sometimes they even threw the purchased materials into the water to alleviate the surplus phenomenon. This kind of boldness and strength is not easily achieved by the current government in our country, which is facing difficulties both privately and publicly, but its principles and spirit are indeed what should be strictly observed when handling purchases and controlling the economy. If someone without this vision and boldness presides over the purchase, only knowing how to make small calculations, it will not benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood!</p>
<p>Because simple profit-seeking is not the goal of the government's purchase, the price, quantity, and types of purchases should be determined according to an appropriate plan to conform to the original intention. We believe that the goods purchased should first be major export goods, second, goods that are not easily exported by private individuals, and third, export goods with particularly difficult funding. In terms of quantity, it should not be restricted too strictly, but it is also not necessary to involve any coercion, so as not to create suspicion of competing with the people for profit. In other words, those who are unwilling to sell at the set price can be free to buy and sell as they please. As for the purchase price, this is the most difficult problem to solve. In principle, it seems most fair to barely cover the cost and be sufficient to maintain production. This should be the main purpose of the government's purchase, and it is also the key to saving export trade. If it is higher than this number, it may be more difficult to sell, and the government may not be able to bear it; if it is lower than this number, vendors and producers will still have no way to continue, and the purpose of relief will not be achieved. However, there are various kinds of costs: (1) the cost of direct producers, (2) the cost of processors, (3) the cost of operators who transport or sell, and (4) the cost of those who repeatedly buy and sell, forming speculators. Among these, items (1, 2, and 3) are the most reasonable and should naturally be taken into account. If the overseas market price is higher than the domestic price, but private individuals are unable to sell due to difficulties in transportation, foreign exchange, and import restrictions, they should be purchased at the market price and should not be overly suppressed to show consideration.</p>
<p>Controlled economy is praised by people at the time; according to the facts, it has both advantages and disadvantages, and often does not meet expectations. As far as the current situation is concerned, apart from foreign exchange, we still believe that only export trade has the value and necessity of implementing a control policy. Although the advocacy of free trade and the elimination of tariff barriers is very loud, there are still few who have thoroughly implemented them. When overseas sales are difficult and international trade cannot be balanced, no matter from which perspective, it is probably very difficult in reality to rely solely on private forces to promote the export of local goods and restore overseas markets. In defeated Japan, its export trade has already been proceeding steadily under the protection of the Allied forces. Therefore, even if it is not for the sake of temporary relief, it seems necessary to catch up quickly on this work. Therefore, we hope that the government's purchase of export goods will be launched quickly and promoted on a large scale, so as to make a fundamental and effective remedy to the common goal of increasing production. Do not get bogged down in trivial details, making sporadic decorations, satisfying only the relief of some exporters. As for the domestic sales restrictions on yarn and cloth, the partial control of coal, and the official transportation and sales of certain specific goods in the Northeast and Taiwan, although they each have their special role at present, they do not have much significance in the national economy. The real unified purchase and sales should start with export trade.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The county government has decided to check national identity cards on major land and water transportation routes within the territory starting from the 15th of next month. Those who do not have them will be detained for two to twenty-four hours as a warning.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>The home of County Councilor Gu Yishu was suddenly broken into by more than 20 thugs in the early morning of the 18th, who destroyed all the objects.

<p>Wujin</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of converting rent into rice, the county government previously approved 90,000 yuan per shi. However, due to the surge in grain prices, it has not been implemented. The county government has now held a meeting with various public organizations and decided that rents that were contracted in rice will be paid at 60% of the market price, and all will be converted to legal tender by the end of August.</p>
<p>Suqian</p>

<h3>US-Soviet Joint Commission Resumes Negotiations to Resolve the Korean Issue; Hodge and Shtykov Deliver Speeches, Urging the Early Establishment of a Korean Provisional Government</h3>
<p>[Hapsong News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The US-Soviet Joint Commission officially opened at 2:02 PM on the 21st at the historic Deoksugung Palace. Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of the US Forces in Korea, presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, calling for US-Soviet cooperation and the early establishment of a Korean provisional government. Subsequently, Soviet Chief Representative Shtykov and US Chief Representative Major General Brown successively rose to deliver speeches. All three emphasized in unison that the establishment of a Korean provisional government was the initial task of the commission. In his speech, Shtykov commented on the "political enthusiasm" of the Korean people in welcoming the resumption of the Joint Commission, stating: "After the collapse of Japanese imperialism, North Korea was placed under the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army. Since then, the region has made significant progress in the development of democratic culture and the national economy. We firmly believe that based on the implementation of the Moscow Agreement, Korea will develop into an independent country along the democratic path and will be able to participate in the camp of peace-loving countries as an equal member. We are deeply aware of the responsibility of the Joint Commission. The Soviet delegation will do its utmost to promote the rapid and successful implementation of the Moscow Agreement." General Hodge's speech stated: "I personally, on behalf of the US government and the Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in Korea, pay tribute to the Soviet delegation. We are here to fulfill the promise of the great powers, which is to re-establish an autonomous and independent Korean government. This promise is encapsulated in the 1945 Moscow Agreement, which also stipulated the method of fulfilling the promise. The US and Soviet sides have agreed in their correspondence to have the Joint Commission fulfill the provisions of the Moscow Agreement based on the democratic principles of freedom of thought and freedom of speech. The US delegation, led by Major General Brown, has been instructed by the government to make the establishment of a Korean provisional government, composed entirely of Koreans, the first and most urgent task of the Joint Commission. The eyes of the world are focused on the Joint Commission, and the Korean people are also looking forward to the arrival of this government. The US and its commander-in-chief earnestly hope that the Joint Commission can carry out its work smoothly and rapidly in a spirit of mutual understanding. This kind of mutual understanding is generated by mutual understanding between great powers. The Joint Commission will fully meet the needs and desires of Korea." The list of US representatives attending the Joint Commission is as follows:</p>
<p>Chief Representative: Major General Brown (a famous general who commanded the landing on Attu Island in May 1943); Major General Weckling (US representative to the previous Joint Commission); Dr. Bens (economic advisor, former American businessman in Korea); Jonna (director of the Department of Commerce's consultant). The list of alternate representatives is as follows: Landon (US Consul General in Korea), Claydi (political advisor). The list of Soviet representatives has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] The US-Soviet Joint Commission officially resumed its meeting here today, lasting 45 minutes. Observers say that the atmosphere of this meeting was more harmonious than the last meeting in February of this year. Shtykov pointed out that the Korean people are eagerly awaiting the results of the meeting. Although the US representative requested that journalists be allowed to attend as observers, the Soviet side did not agree.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Attitude on the Korean Issue Seems to Have Become Slightly More Compromising</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 20th] The fate of Korea will be decided by the US-Soviet Joint Commission. It is expected that before the commission reaches an agreement on the unification and political democratization of Korea, it will go through a long period of negotiations. According to US observers, the main difficulty to be overcome by the US-Soviet Joint Commission is the definition of the advisory power to be granted to Korean political groups, as well as the organization of the Korean provisional government. The Soviet Union originally did not want to grant advisory power to political parties in the US-occupied zone, most of which represent the landlord class. The Soviet Union believes that they have a tendency to be politically omnipotent and have cooperated with Japan in the past. It was not until last month that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov wrote to US Secretary of State Marshal, expressing his agreement to grant advisory power to these political parties. The fact that both the US and the Soviet Union now want to quickly resolve the Korean issue is indeed a symbol of hope. The Korean people in both the US and Soviet occupied zones also demand the swift withdrawal of foreign troops. The economic situation in Korea is currently deteriorating, especially in the Soviet occupied zone. The US occupied zone lacks coal, while the Soviet occupied zone lacks grain. The people are deeply dissatisfied with the current political situation, resulting in political demonstrations in the US occupied zone. At the same time, refugees from the Soviet occupied zone are fleeing to the US occupied zone in an endless stream.</p>
<h3>US Senior Naval Admiral Visits the Capitals of Iran and Turkey; Believed to Be on an Important Mission</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 20th] Admiral Conolly, Commander of the US Mediterranean Fleet, who just completed important talks in Delhi, arrived here today and will meet with the Turkish Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, and Chief of Staff. He was accompanied by 11 US naval officers. Conolly insisted that his mission was not related to the $100 million loan to Turkey. While in Tehran, Conolly met with the King of Iran and also met with Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh and Chief of Staff Amadi.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] London diplomatic circles believe that US Mediterranean Fleet Commander Conolly's visit to Tehran and Ankara should only be a ceremonial visit. The official explanation from the US Navy is that Admiral Conolly's trip is to inspect the US fleet currently making goodwill visits to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean. The British government believes that it is not surprising for a senior naval admiral to visit the prime minister and minister of defense of a foreign country when visiting that country. However, political circles believe that Conolly's trip, which comes at a time when Congress has just approved aid to Greece and Turkey, may have the importance of formulating a local defense plan. Conolly's trip to Tehran has also raised the question of whether the US will provide Iran with a loan similar to the aid to Greece and Turkey. If so, Washington will clearly express its interest in the defense of Iran and the Persian Gulf.</p>
<h3>Indians Scramble to See US Warship; A Dispute Occurs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 21st] When the visiting US cruiser "Toledo" was opened for viewing yesterday afternoon, the crowd was too large, and the police had to be called in to maintain order and prevent later arrivals from boarding the ship. This aroused the anger of some people, who shouted "Go back, Yankee!" The ship has been closed to the public today. The "Free Press Journal" titled its report on yesterday's incident "The Cruiser-Crazy Crowd Tasted the Marines" and stated, "Shining bayonets and rifles served as a response to the enthusiastic people of Bombay." US officials denied that US soldiers had fixed bayonets at the time. The "Toledo" is scheduled to sail to Japan tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>British and American Fleets Arrive in Trieste</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 21st] Two British and American cruisers, accompanied by other warships from the British Mediterranean Fleet, docked in Trieste today. Allied officials said that the arrival of the ships had no special significance.</p>
<p>[Hapsong News Agency, Gibraltar, 20th] The advance fleet of the US visiting Gibraltar fleet arrived here on the 20th. The fleet includes a transport ship and two destroyers. The aircraft carrier "Leyte" and other warships are scheduled to arrive next week.</p>

Mr. Marshall declined to explain the funding plan, but Republican Representative Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, stated that the bill is still awaiting President Truman's signature, and its use must be explained before the committee votes to allocate the funds.</p>

<h3>Stars Seen in Daylight, Earth Without Light: Scientists Observe Solar Eclipse; Landlord Asks to Get Rid of Bad Neighbor</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 20th] American and Brazilian scientists observing the total solar eclipse in Bucarein, Brazil, observed the evolution of the total solar eclipse in perfect conditions, while scientists from the Soviet Union, Sweden, Finland, and Canada observing in Araxa, Brazil, were only able to make two minutes of perfect observation during the four minutes of totality. The head of the American observation team stated that they achieved 93 percent success. The Soviet observation team was unwilling to announce the results of the observation. However, Canadian scientists observing in the same environment as the Soviet observation team said that they achieved most of the success. According to American scientists, this observation shows that Einstein's theory of relativity is 95 percent consistent with the facts. After detailed study upon their return home, they will thoroughly review Einstein's theory of relativity again. During the solar eclipse, even in the afternoon, the earth was shrouded in darkness, and only the stars twinkled in the sky, and the street lights were also turned on. Superstitious farmers knelt and prayed. The locals never believed the scientific explanation of the cause of the solar eclipse, believing that the Americans were here in connection with the atomic bomb test. A landlord wrote to the head of the American team, saying, "I know you are going to test the atomic bomb. You can use my land. I have a bad neighbor, and I hope the first atomic bomb can be dropped on his land." As the solar eclipse gradually receded, it was like dawn, and the roosters crowed in unison to announce the daybreak.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 21st] British and American representatives of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee have gathered a great deal of evidence regarding Yugoslavia's aid to Greek guerrillas. This is one part of the conclusions in the report to be submitted to the Security Council by the committee secretariat.

<h3>Large Quantity of Opium Seized in Air Transport Case: Hidden in Nineteen Fan Motors; Principal Offender Lu Hegao Arrested</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau cracked another major air transport drug trafficking case the day before yesterday, seizing two magnetic barrels of opium, weighing approximately several hundred taels. The principal offender, Lu Hegao, 35 years old, from Shanghai, was arrested at 4 Xingfu Lane, Chongqing South Road. At the same time, an accomplice, Chi Shunfu (42 years old, from Shanghai), was also apprehended at 60 Baoyu Lane, Zhengdong East Road. Due to the complexity of the case, the police bureau has requested the prosecutor's office to detain them for ten days for detailed investigation. According to confidential reports received recently by the head of the Criminal Investigation Division, Zheng Junhou, someone entrusted Central Aviation to air transport nineteen electric fan motors from Kunming, which arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month. The cores of these motors contained a large quantity of opium, which are currently stored at 60 Baoyu Lane, Zhengdong East Road, and are being sold successively. After Chief Zheng reported to his superiors, he dispatched section chief Chen Jinsheng, officers Li Xiqing, Ye Kui, Hua Zhiru, and others, disguised as customers, to the location at 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. However, they were refused by Chi Shunfu, a resident of the premises (currently a teahouse attendant at the Huizhong Hotel). Seeing his flustered expression, the police officers immediately conducted a search, and as a result, they found two magnetic barrels in the side room, with the seal of a certain organization affixed to the outside. After opening the magnetic barrels, they found that they contained raw opium. At this point, Chi was dumbfounded. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed that they were deposited by his friend Lu Hegao, who lived at 4 Xingfu Lane, Chongqing South Road. The police immediately went to the address and arrested the principal offender. Lu also confessed that after the motors arrived in Shanghai, they were transported to the Chifu Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Plant on Feihong Road, Hongzhen, where the cores were dismantled, the opium was taken out, and all the motors were sold to the factory. Based on the confession, the bureau completely hoisted the motors to the bureau yesterday for research, and learned that the case involves many people, who are currently being closely pursued.</p>

According to the indictment, Huang is a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, 39 years old, and lives at 504 Wuding Road.

The case was heard in the Second Criminal Court of the local court yesterday morning by Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu. The court first questioned the plaintiff, Xiao Wang Lili, who stated: "The plaintiff met the defendant Wei Baoli in November 1942 while dancing at the Paramount Ballroom. Wei actually tried to intoxicate the plaintiff with alcohol first, and then raped her. Afterwards, the two began living together, which has lasted for six years. Recently, due to a breakdown in their relationship, the two quarreled at the police station, and each was fined 50,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, recently Wei has formed a new relationship outside and intends to abandon her, so she was forced to seek legal remedies and filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to compensate her for mental, physical, and reputational damages of 1.2 billion yuan, and living expenses of 216 million yuan." Subsequently, the defendant Wei Baoli stated: "The defendant and Xiao Wang Lili have always had a harmonious relationship, but recently, due to the instigation of his mother and sister, they have become involved in a lawsuit.

<p>[Compilation of Labor Strikes Demanding Improved Treatment]</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] More than 400 workers of the American Hai Ning Foreign Company issued a declaration a few days ago, requesting the factory to improve treatment and replace Personnel Section Chief Cai Mingguang, totaling eight demands.

The workers then sent representatives to the Social Bureau in the afternoon to report the process. The bureau has ordered the employer to resume work first and then negotiate.</p>
<p>More than 180 workers of the British Jardine Brewery went on strike on the morning of the 19th because their request for improved treatment was not met. The employer stated that it could not accept the two demands made by the workers, and the workers continued the strike. The Social Bureau is currently mediating.</p>
<p>The foreign-owned Hua Aluminum Steel Factory declared a shutdown and laid off workers on the pretext of insufficient raw materials due to labor-management discord. It is reported that the employer's profit from storing raw materials has been abundant, so the price of refined steel paper on the market has soared since the shutdown. The Social Bureau had ordered the resumption of work immediately, but the factory refused to comply. A few days ago, the bureau again ordered the factory to resume work. If it resists again, it will submit a request to the municipal government for severe punishment.</p>
<p>The employees of the British Zheng Guanghe Soda Company, hearing that the machinery industry in the Fourth District, such as the British Shenchang Foreign Company, had already de-frosted in disguise in April, planned to make the same request and were scheduled to negotiate with the factory today.</p>

<h3>黃牛黨內幕 獨包全場球賽門票 資本雄厚神通廣大 黨魁就擒暴露秘密</h3>
<p>[Inside Story of Ticket Scalpers: Solely Purchasing Tickets for All Stadium Games, Vast Capital and Powerful Connections, Leader Arrested Reveals Secrets]</p>
<p>Wang Zhaohuai, Director of the Railway Bureau Police Department, ordered his subordinates to investigate and arrest the ticket scalpers who have been harming the railway station recently. Ying Guoguang, a patrol officer of the Eighth Section of the Third Section of the Xihu Section of the department, discovered a suspicious young man at the first and second class ticket office at the North Station at 8:00 PM on the 20th of this month. Upon closer inspection, he knew that he was the leader of the ticket scalpers, Zhang Acai. At that time, for fear of alarming the snake, he did not reveal his identity and secretly monitored him. At 8:00 PM, he saw Zhang Acai take out a stack of tickets and tout them to passengers, selling them for 15,000 yuan each. Just as he was about to collect the money, Officer Ying saw that the evidence was true and stepped forward to arrest him. On the spot, he found five Wuxi second-class tickets and more than 830,000 yuan in cash. According to his confession, there are two sources of tickets. Ding instructed small ticket scalpers to purchase tickets at the station's business office and travel agencies, and after purchasing them, they were collected by him, with each ticket scalper receiving 1,000 yuan for each ticket. Then he distributed them for sale. He also said that recently, because the station's prevention was too strict, the risk was too great, and it was easy to be caught, so he had changed his position to various cinemas and football stadiums. At the beginning of this month, in the game between Seoul and Xingdong, the Football Association sold a total of 60,000 tickets. More than 15,000 of them were purchased by him directly and indirectly, and then resold. Each ticket scalper made more than 700,000 yuan that day. He also said that there are many times to make money, but there are also times to lose money. In the inter-city match between Hong Kong and Shanghai, the match between Hualian and Xilian, they purchased all 4,500 football tickets at that time, but only 2,500 tickets were sold, and the rest could not be sold, resulting in a loss of 10 million yuan. The criminal finally confessed that recently, due to the off-season for train tickets and football tickets, the interest is very thin, and the target has been shifted to cinemas. On average, each ticket scalper can get 2 million yuan for each film. The "Number One in the World" film is always full, so each ticket scalper actually earns more than 4 million yuan. Director Wang, seeing that the truth has been revealed, is scheduled to transfer him to the local prosecutor's office for legal action within days.</p>
<h3>大批美煙失竊 汽車照會追出綫索 捕獲五犯吊出贓物四十箱</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Flander, a Westerner from the Shanghai East Ruifeng Company, reported to the Yulin Road Police Branch at about 10:50 AM on the 18th that the warehouse gate was pried open, between 4:00 and 6:00 AM, and a total of 101 boxes of American cigarettes such as Camel, Six, and Morris, worth over 250 million yuan, were stolen. Zhou, the branch director, ordered Yuan Jie, the head of the criminal section, and Yue, the police chief, to rush to the scene to investigate and inquire in detail in the vicinity. It was learned that a truck loaded with iron had left, and only the last three digits of the truck's registration were "483". Section Chief Yuan obtained this clue and dispatched all plainclothes police officers to investigate. As a result, it was found that the truck used to transport the American cigarettes was No. 35483, which belonged to Shi Jinji Transportation Company on Yunnan Road. The original case handlers went to the company to investigate and learned that the truck was actually owned by Zhu Donggeng, who lived at 479 Weihawei Road, and the truck was registered with the company and rented out daily for business. The driver, Tong Wengrong, lived at No. 15 Deyu Lane, Dongyouheng Road. Police were dispatched there, but Tong had already fled. Later, his wife was seen going out, and disguised police officers followed her to the entrance of Mingde Lane, Dongweizhi Road, where she was seen talking to Miao Zubi. They were arrested together, and after strict questioning, they admitted to stealing the American cigarettes. They also confessed that their accomplices were Yan Dahe, who lived at No. 514, Shenzhou Hotel, and police were sent there to arrest Yan and Wang Ruiquan. Later, Wang Yongfu was apprehended at No. 220, Daxin Hotel, Hubei Road. According to his confession, he and several others divided 4.5 boxes of stolen goods and hid them in Hongzhen. Twenty-three boxes were recovered. Eight boxes were found at a certain number in Ziyou Lane, Guangdong Road, and nine boxes were recovered from Qiaojiazhai in Nanshi. Sixty-one boxes are still missing and the investigation is continuing.</p>

<p>[Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation]</p>
<p>(1) Life Insurance Dispute</p>
<p>Zhou Hejie asked: My late husband took out a life insurance policy for 2,000 yuan with the Renchou Insurance Company in 1930. My husband passed away due to illness last September, and I immediately requested compensation from the company. The company replied that the country has no legal multiplier for compensation, and if I want to receive the money, I can only receive 2,000 yuan. I have negotiated for half a year and the issue has not been resolved. I went to negotiate again a few days ago, and the company repeatedly declined on the same grounds. I don't know how to handle this matter. Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied] According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Repatriation: "If, after the establishment of a legal act, an event that cannot be attributed to the parties causes a change in circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is clearly unfair, the court should fairly weigh and increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects of the judgment." In this case, you can sue the court for adjudication.</p>

<p>Lu Yaoming asked: A has a studio apartment that he rents to B for residence. B sublets it to C without notifying the landlord. The landlord did not notice when B moved out. Now I have several questions, please provide answers: (1) Is it legal for B to not cancel his household registration after moving out? (2) Is it legal for B to sublet to C without notifying the landlord? (3) Can the landlord order C to move out? (4) After B moved out, his address is unknown and there is no way to contact him. C also refuses to pay rent, claiming that the room was rented from B and the landlord has no right to interfere. What legal action should I take?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replied] (1, 2) Illegal. (3) Since C has not legally rented the property, he is occupying it without rights, and you can request him to move out. (4) You can request a court ruling.</p>

<p>[Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters Fulfills Its Responsibility of Prior Guidance, Sends Personnel to Various Schools Yesterday to Advise Against Gathering for Parades]</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In order to implement the Provisional Measures for Maintaining Order promulgated by the National Government, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander General Xuan ordered all garrison troops and police investigation personnel to fully prevent actions such as strikes, work stoppages, and organized parades. Now there is a trend of resurgence of student unrest in this city.

If there are still saboteurs instigating disturbances to public order, the headquarters will strictly enforce the order. The investigation brigades have concentrated all their efforts in recent days to closely monitor the development of student unrest, preparing to deploy at any time to carry out their tasks. Also, yesterday, some schools had incidents of students fighting each other, which the Garrison Headquarters did not intervene in, but if it has an impact on public order, it will intervene, he said.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Appeals to University Students in This City to Resume Classes, Pursue Studies, and Stabilize Society</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued an "Appeal to University Students of This City," saying: "To all university students in Shanghai: Recently, you gentlemen have been making demands to the government due to school reforms and living issues. This motivation is originally pure, and the government has already provided satisfactory solutions to the demands. It is now appropriate to promptly resume classes, restore normalcy, and demonstrate the resilience of our youth movement to be able to advance and withdraw. However, there are still a few malicious elements who are coercing and manipulating the situation, leading to large-scale strikes, petitions, and parades in places like Beijing and Shanghai. This is even turning a simple youth movement into an uncontrollable situation. The impact is not only that your studies are wasted and your precious time is squandered, but also that residents in the city are alarmed, and social order is disrupted. The National Government, in order to maintain social order, has already issued a clear decree promulgating temporary measures. The Chairman, amidst his busy schedule, has also issued a statement, clearly indicating the essential meaning of rectifying academic atmosphere and upholding law and discipline, with sincere and earnest words that are thought-provoking. You gentlemen are all outstanding youths and cadres for national reconstruction. You should restrain yourselves to follow the Chairman's clear instructions, protect the schools and resume classes, in order to avoid wasting time. You should no longer make excessive demands or take inappropriate actions that would affect the reputation of youth among social figures, causing pain to your loved ones and joy to your enemies. We sincerely hope that you will restrain your emotions, display rationality, and voluntarily stop any excessive actions, thereby stabilizing society through stabilizing schools, and promoting the future construction of the country through your own resumption of classes and pursuit of studies. The Chamber of Commerce, representing all merchants and residents of the city, extends our sincere condolences and earnest advice to you. We hope you will take it into consideration."</p>
<h3>City Council and Other Organizations Advise Students to Stop Strikes and Petitioning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Council, the City Local Cooperation Association, the City Education Association, the City Farmers' Association, the City Journalists' Association, the City Women's Movement Association, the City Federation of Trade Unions, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the National Government and Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, and also sent telegrams to newspapers, legal organizations, and colleges and universities across the country, supporting the temporary measures to maintain social order passed by the State Council meeting, and advising students to immediately stop strikes and petitioning. The original text is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, and all newspapers, legal organizations, and colleges and universities across the country: In recent weeks, labor strikes and student movements have successively arisen in Beijing and Shanghai. Recently, students from various schools have been engaging in actions that exceed normal boundaries under the name of collective petitions, disrupting traffic and obstructing public affairs. As a result, not only is the valuable education of many young people being sacrificed, but also the peaceful order of the entire society is being disrupted. Considering the future, how can we not be apprehensive! Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, with deep consideration and planning, recently issued a statement earnestly advising young people across the country to value reason and abide by the law. At the same time, the State Council meeting passed six temporary measures to maintain social order, which are indeed essential measures for the present situation. In addition to representing all citizens of Shanghai in wholeheartedly supporting these measures, we also hope that the lovable young people across the country will restrain their emotions, strongly advocate reason, recognize that democracy prioritizes abiding by the law, that strikes are a suicidal act, and that if there are requests, they can send representatives to make suggestions to the authorities through legal procedures. They must not disregard discipline and resort to marches and gatherings to coerce and threaten, causing noise and violence, plunging society into turmoil, and leaving the country with endless sorrow. The wise young people across the country, who bear the heavy responsibility of inheriting the national destiny, should be able to understand this intention. We hope they will resolutely and immediately stop strikes and petitioning, restore normalcy, work hard in their studies to secure peace, seek educational progress, and complete their tasks by abiding by the law. We hereby express our sincere concerns, hoping for your wise consideration."</p>
<h3>Demobilized Youth Army Students Oppose Suspension of Teaching and Classes</h3>
<p>Yesterday Released a Letter to Students Nationwide</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The demobilized youth army students of Shanghai's colleges and universities yesterday released a "Letter to Students Nationwide," stating: "We support increasing public funds and raising education funding through reasonable means, and oppose destructive behaviors such as the suspension of teaching and classes. Education is the foundation of a country, and education funding must be increased in order to cultivate talents and build the nation. Students should focus on studying at school. Strikes and parades sacrifice education, which is unfair to oneself, one's parents, and the country. Moreover, today's student movements are full of conspiracies and deceptions, and pure students are unknowingly being used as political tools. Regarding school issues, we should put forward specific opinions and demand that the government resolve them reasonably."</p>
<h3>Students Want to Attend Classes But Cannot</h3>
<p>Jinan University Student Union Reported to Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The Jinan University Student Union, regarding the kidnapping of Wang Shihua and Yu Huanrong, the newly elected executive directors and directors of the union, by the organizers of the previous student union, held a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the Xinli Restaurant in Yokohama Bridge at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the incident and appeal to the press to uphold justice and protect the basic rights of personal freedom. According to reports, the reason for the kidnapping was related to the promotion of the "Eat All" movement. Our view on this movement is that we absolutely demand that the Ministry of Education increase the amount of public funds and the number of public-funded places (our union has already sent a telegram in response to Central University and the Ministry of Education), but we do not support "Eat All" because most of the students at our school are self-funded, and "Eat All" only benefits a small number of people. Currently, the school is completely shrouded in a climate of terror. Students want to attend classes but cannot, and the president has resigned, leaving the school administration in a state of anarchy. All of this is caused by the armed control of a small number of people. At a time when the democratic trend is rising, such a phenomenon that disregards legal principles is truly regrettable. We urge all those who advocate rationality to do their best to stop it.</p>
<h3>City Government to Send Police to Protect Datong School Property</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Datong University students demanded reform of the school administration and began a strike on the 16th. The school has not yet formally come forward to seek a solution. Until yesterday, the situation became increasingly deadlocked. Principal Hu, considering the激ang情绪 of the students and feeling unable to resolve the situation, wrote to Mayor Wu yesterday requesting that police be sent to protect the school property. Mayor Wu immediately sent Ge Kexin, a counselor of the municipal government, to the school at 2:00 PM to investigate. After the person in charge of the student union explained in detail to Ge, they sent three representatives to visit Mayor Wu at the municipal government, where they were received. Mayor Wu stated that in order to protect the school property, the students should immediately vacate the classrooms, otherwise, police officers would be sent to the school to intervene.</p>
<h3>Student Brawl at Shanghai Law College</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a student brawl occurred at the Shanghai Law College on Jiangwan Road.

<h3>Guangzhou Student Union Issues Letter to Students Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] In view of the recent student movements in various places, where students have often exceeded the scope of national morality and national law, the City Student Union has issued a letter to students nationwide, stating that the actions of student movements in various places have exceeded the boundaries of education and youth and have fallen into political whirlpools. They are obviously being manipulated by communist elements, turning schools into arenas for political disputes and students into political tools. The letter also specifically pointed out that the Communist Party should be held responsible for the war as they used troops to invade and plunder. However, some students shift the blame for the war to the government and do not say a word about the Communist Party. If they say they are not being directed by others, who will believe them? The letter concludes by urging students nationwide to consider the country's difficulties and the importance of their own responsibilities, and not to act blindly.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Normal School Not on Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou, 21st] The rumors that the provincial normal schools in Zhejiang Province went on strike on the 20th after failing to petition the provincial government are absolutely untrue. There are no student movements in the provincial colleges and universities.

<h3>The Fifth Expedition of the Expeditionary Basketball Team, Will Fight Encas Today at 7:00 PM at the City Stadium</h3>
<p>The Expeditionary Basketball Team came to Shanghai, won four games and gained great fame. Tonight at 7:00 PM, they will play their fifth game, meeting with foreign soldiers for the first time. The opponent is the Western Youth League's strong team, Encas. Tickets are 5,000 upstairs and 8,000 downstairs. Please still ask the Siwei Boy Scouts to maintain order at the venue. The referees are Qu Honglu and Xuan He Gao. In addition, the Group B Basketball League has been rescheduled for today.</p>
<p>The Expeditionary Basketball Team's past four games have fully demonstrated its bravery and good fighting skills, and its characteristics of sufficient energy and strength. Captain Cai Yirui Zhang Liu Zhengjun has excellent performances in every game, and Tu Wenlong's shooting is accurate, which can be compared to the Qunsheng team. In addition, Wang Binghuan and newcomer Cheng Fei are relatively weak, but they are also up to standard, and after four games, they are very accustomed to the floor lighting. It is natural to expect a more skilled performance. Last year, when the team first came to Shanghai, they lost to Encas. After a year, their desire for revenge has never been relieved. This time they meet again, and the generals will definitely work together to defeat the foreign soldiers and avenge their previous shame. Encas and Giant are the two strongest teams in the Western Youth League, guided by Mutuals Kaijiemi Luofu, and have the potential to surpass the blue and surpass the basket. The Boleikai Luosiji brothers and Ao Chai Liao are all outstanding in ball skills and brave in battle. The team's style is to fight hard. This time, they will meet with the Expeditionary Army, and there will be a fierce battle. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>[Expeditionary] Wu Jian (leader), Cai Zhongqiang (captain), Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Zhang Gengsheng, Ji Dezang, Wang Binghuan, Chen Baoshu, Ma Xilin, Cheng Fei.</p>
<p>[Encas] Kaijiemi Luofu (coach), Ge Pengqi Gufu, E Kai Luosiji, V Kai Luosiji, Ma Han, Bolei, Ao Chai Liao, Fu Lan Ke.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis League: Siming Jia vs Qingdao</h3>
<p>In the second Table Tennis League, there were ten matches the night before last. The Qingniao team, taking advantage of their victory over Dongchang, fought against the strong team Siming Jia. Qingniao once took the lead with a score of three to one, but unfortunately, they declined after reaching their peak and lost three consecutive cities, and were defeated by Siming Jia with a score of three to four. In this game, Siming Jia had to replace the strong player Pian Fushun, who was disqualified from the competition, with the retired veteran Gui Weimin to help out. Although Gui was exhausted and lost to Qingniao's good player Qian Yunqing, his skills were still outstanding.

<p>Yesterday on the Huagu market, Yong Sha's price ceilings were still being raised due to concentrated gains by large investors, and follow-up price increases will still be necessary. However, rumors of profit-taking were unfavorable to buyers, and although the market was brisk in the afternoon, it appeared uncertain.

Nos. 60, 77, 36, 106, 82, 225, 42, 143, 97, 89, and 190 became increasingly aggressive in buying, and finally, near noon, they pulled the deferred Yong Sha up to its price ceiling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha reached its price ceiling, and Mei Ya fell to its price limit, with some recovery, falling by half a percent. Xin He rose by half a percent, and Xin Guang, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing each fell by about half a percent. Xin Hua fell by one percent, and Yong Gong rose by less than half a percent.

Xin He was also advanced by Nos. 180, 4, and 311 to around 3,700 yuan. Yong Gong quickly fell back after reaching its price ceiling. Later, news spread that the Four Banks and Two Bureaus had been ordered not to participate in stock arbitrage, and several large commercial banks had also stopped. Nos. 133, 185, 129, 69, 235, 36, 65, 231, and 155 all sold off, and the price fell to below the limit. Jing Lun also fell to its price limit.

<h3>Bai Geng Slightly Declining - Rice Market Trading Brisk - More Cooking Oil Arriving, Price Slightly Declining</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The rice market was affected by the storm last night, resulting in fewer arrivals. A total of 3,663 shi arrived at the South Market and 3,859 shi at the North Market. The market momentum carried over from the previous day's price increases and remained very firm, with brisk trading. The upper-grade Bai Geng was quoted at 330,000 yuan at the North Market the previous day and 318,000 yuan at the South Market. Yesterday, the South Market rose, while the North Market declined slightly, and the two markets leveled out at 325,000 yuan. Medium-grade Bai Geng was traded at 310,000 to 320,000 yuan, and lower-grade at 295,000 to 313,000 yuan. Upper-grade Bo Dao was traded at 315,000 to 325,000 yuan, medium-grade at 305,000 to 320,000 yuan, and lower-grade at 300,000 to 315,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Upper-grade Early Rice was traded at 300,000 to 318,000 yuan, medium-grade at 290,000 to 310,000 yuan, and lower-grade at 285,000 to 305,000 yuan.

<p>Ji Mingqi, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that President Chiang had previously telegraphed orders to military units in various regions not to arbitrarily purchase military grain locally and that the Food Ministry should handle the matter in a unified manner. This measure would greatly help to suppress grain prices in the producing areas. Currently, the price of Sichuan Xian rice is only 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per shi. Even with the high cost of transporting goods due to the Yangtze River's rising water levels, profits can still be made after arriving in Shanghai. Rice can also be transported from Wuhu and Jiangxi, and with the addition of foreign rice as a supplement, it is hoped that the lean season can be navigated.</p>
<p>Also, news: Yesterday, flour fell by 1,000 yuan due to declines in the inland areas. Wheat bran sales were sluggish, with prices decreasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were quiet, with some arrivals from the Northeast, resulting in a flat and weak trend, initially firm but later flat, falling by 300 to 500 yuan.</p>
<p>For the oil market, arrivals continued from the Yangtze River and the Northeast, and factory supplies were uninterrupted, but trading was slow. Soybean oil fell by 10,000 yuan, refined oil fell sharply by 20,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil and sesame oil each fell by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Northeast soybeans were actively digested, maintaining a firm position, with upper-grade beans increasing slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Other Du Huang and Han Huang soybeans were generally flat. Mung bean digestion was sluggish, falling by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red beans were flat and steady, and red sorghum sales to distilleries remained strong, increasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame arrivals and sales were both slow, and the market was stable. Raw peanuts were flat, with no price changes. Corn from Qingdao and Tianjin was actively bought, soaring by more than 10,000 yuan, creating a volatile situation.</p>
<p>Also, news: Canadian flour arrived yesterday. The "Lan Ke" of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., managed by Mr. Lanke, arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver yesterday morning, carrying over 130,000 bags of flour and 500 pieces of sleepers.</p>
<h3>Bonds Slightly Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds slightly increased again, but the process was still mediocre. Tong Bing opened at 14,000 yuan, rising from 13,600 yuan as Rooms 503 and 550 moved to close the transaction around 14,700 yuan. Rund De and Room 326 exited. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi increased by 1,000 yuan, Bing rose by 900 yuan, and Ding and Wu each increased by 800 yuan. About 5 million in transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks See Only Ken Zhi Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks saw Guangzhou and North brokerages sell, and some carried goods from the port back to sell, so despite securities brokerages buying, supply still exceeded demand. Yi Sha opened in the morning at 74,000 yuan, and lowered from 75,000 yuan to 71,000 yuan, before noon closing at 72,500 yuan. In the afternoon, from 74,000 yuan, it was forced down to closing near the 70,000 yuan level. Only Ken Zhi showed signs of stability. As a result, compared to the previous calculation, Ken Zhi rose half a percent, British Steel Union fell one percent, and the remaining stocks decreased about half a percent.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>The cigarette market yesterday, starting at the opening, saw some sporadic new orders still flowing, and the market was holding firm. "Great Britain" brand cigarettes hovered around 7.55 million per crate, before pulling back to 7.5 million. Many transactions were opened and the noon closing was similar. Towards afternoon the market turned sluggish, and it was heard that Da Dong Nan company would assign 20 branches of Brandy cigarettes, stipulating the special grade be assigned 30,000 branches, at an assigned price of 3.24 million. Level A was 20,000 branches, at 2.16 million. There was also Yong Tai He assigning 10 branches of Qian Men cigarettes, with a notice posted stipulating level A was assigned 35 units at a price of 1.4875 million. Level B was assigned 23 units, at 977,500. That caused the industry’s money flow to tighten, and buyer entry interest waned and the market quickly retreated. The Great Britain brand in the middle once briefly broke into the 7 million benchmark, falling to a low of 6.8 million, and the Old Knife saw a low of 6.5 million, until the end when the price of the Great Britain brand was 7.29 million, and the Old Knife was 6.63 million. Other Chinese brand cigarettes also fell considerably, but there were takers for Ting Tou and Jia Li Ke and 3-5 brands, and the prices remained steady.</p>
<h3>Second-Quarter Foreign Cotton Allotment Completed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The foreign cotton allotment committee held a meeting at the Limited Amount Allotment location at 5PM yesterday, with main director Li Gan, committee member Rong Yixin, and Guo Dihuo and Liu Wenteng attending. They discussed until 6 o’clock before adjourning. At that time, the limited amount of foreign cotton for the second quarter, at US$20 million, adding up to about 100,000 foreign cotton bales, was completely allotted. The allotted method was based on each yarn factory’s spindle count as the standard.</p>
<p>Also, it is learned: Regarding the first quarter foreign cotton amount of US$40 million, adding up to about 230,000 foreign cotton bales, one third has already arrived at the port, one third is on the way, and one third is awaiting shipment. It is estimated that by the end of June, all can be transported to China. Currently each factory’s average cotton reserves is three months, so after the first quarter foreign cotton quota arrives, the reserves can sustain until the end of October. If the second quarter quota foreign cotton can be shipped before the end of October, then the year’s cotton supply volume will be sufficient. National cotton can roughly be sold in September or October, but due to transport issues, the earliest it can be shipped for sale will be next year.</p>
<h3>New Minister of Economic Affairs To Come to Shanghai - Negotiate Solutions to Current Difficulties for Textile Construction</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] China Textile Construction’s vice general manager Wu Weijing was recently called to Beijing by the former and current Ministers of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Chen Qitian, and Mr. Wu made requests regarding Textile Construction’s current and future business policies and their development. Mr. Wu returned to Shanghai that evening, and told our reporter: He proposed several points: (1) Textile Construction Company is a vast business structure, so it is hoped that all affairs will not be overly formalized, so as to avoid affecting the company’s production and business development. (2) Business policies must be defined. The government’s control of yarn prices must be done consistently, to avoid the company’s sales prices differing too greatly from the market price, which will make the company’s business management become increasingly difficult. (3) Company colleagues with proficient skills and ample experience should be given better compensation to encourage them. Mr. Chen expressed: The Qingnian party is participating in the national government to serve the country. Textile Construction is a specialized and technical business structure, which differs from ordinary political structures. He sincerely hopes that the company’s existing colleagues, under the direction of Manager Dong, continue to work hard. He definitely does not hope for any changes. Mr. Chen is scheduled to take office this Saturday as Minister of Economic Affairs, and come to Shanghai to discuss with Mr. Dong solutions for various difficulties currently facing the company.</p>
<p>Also, news: Six representatives from the company’s branch technical personnel have gone to Beijing yesterday, and plan to present several opinions to the company’s chairman Wang Yunwu for his consideration, with the following main points: (1) Company profits should be used to develop cotton spinning and related businesses. (2) The company should be changed into an ordinary commercial structure. (3) Adjust colleagues’ compensation.</p>
<h3>Gunny Sack Amount Allotment Issues - Shipping and Transport Association Calls Related Industries to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shipping and Transport Committee’s limited amount allotment office yesterday morning called together the cement, alkali manufacturing, refined salt, flour, and Central Trust Bureau industries to discuss gunny sack amount allotment issues. Each industry discussed the need for gunny sacks in great detail. A final decision: the Association should task each industry with sending definite numbers for the need of the second quarter for review by the end of the month, and then reconvene the related industries for a meeting, to determine the percentage amount that each industry should receive.

Finally, regarding gunny sack allocation, for thoroughness and close review, the Association further decided to create a sub-committee specializing in handling the gunny sack allocation matters for each factory.</p>
<h3>Fran Rong Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>Lately, Fran Rong sales have been brisk. Street customer brokerages continue to have demand, plain light gray and medium gray, retail and bulk transactions are managed well. Every factory’s goods can all be sold between 110,000-120,000, to 150,000-160,000. American goods are sold at 140,000-150,000, British goods sell for between 180,000 and 270,000-280,000.

<h3>Price Even with Previous Day - Rayon Market Steady - Factory Owners and Buyers Watching, Gradually Becoming Weary</h3>
<p>Rayon market has entered a defined situation, yesterday continued to turn within 7 million, and in the end the price evened out with the previous day. No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang opened at 6.7 million, reaching 7 million in the morning before closing. The Sanma brand saw a transaction at 17 million. The final asking price for the afternoon was 6.7 million for those who wanted to buy, and 900,000 for those who wanted to sell, but the other brands had no ups and downs.</p>
<p>Factory owners are gradually becoming weary because the buyers are watching. Yesterday’s market ask price at each level was 300,000 to 500,000 lower than the previous day. E grade was doing at 19.8 million, and ordinary other grades were asking 19 million, but transactions were extremely few. The trend appears to still have some weakness.</p>
<p>The silk goods market was also fairly steady yesterday. A silk quilt cover made by Dacheng was asking 8.4 million, and a counter-offer of 8.3 million was not transacted. Checkered Bi Chou was asking 2,300 at the opening, doing at 600 before turning back to the last ask price of 2,000. Every other day the opening ask price was 2,300. The production of Chongdian power spun fabrics was low, and raw fabrics were being reported at 230,000. Therefore, the Shanghai market opened doing 260,000-270,000, but other goods saw no great changes.</p>
<h3>Supply Is More Than Demand - Market Is Still Uninspired</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw tight money flow and at the open, because of the Textile Construction company distributing yarn, sales were lively, but the customer brokerages’ purchasing was turning flat.

But 32-count and 16-count yarn, were being purchased by towel, handkerchief, and sock factories, so the prices were firm.</p>
<p>Textile Construction company yesterday as usual distributed yarn, and each count had a tendency for coarse yarns to be weaker and thin yarns to be slightly fair. 824 pieces were sold, completely sold to factories, with 627 purchase orders.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s cotton cloth saw the morning open with still brisk demand, and the opening ask price was once steady, but then it was heard that exports from North China were being limited, and that Textile Construction’s cloth supply from the previous day, Wu Fu fine cloth and Ruyi bleached cloth, even though numbered for allotment, were entirely completely allotted to dye factories, and there were ample blank cloth chips, and operators in the business were tightened by money flow, and the street purchasing was sluggish, and brokerages from Tianjin were expressing their inventory on the market, and the market collapsed. 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was from 302,000-303,000 to the final 293,000, declining 13,000 from the previous day.

<h3>Tea Merchants' Joint Meeting Applies for Loan: China Farmers Bank to First Allocate Raw Tea Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Regarding the improvement of this year's tea loan plan, tea merchants originally intended to suggest adopting a loan-for-processing method, with the government purchasing the produced tea at a fixed price. It is learned that the Central Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Tea Corporation, among others, gathered yesterday morning to discuss this matter. They believe that this method is difficult to implement. The government finds it hard to stipulate a purchase price, and the estimated total purchase price would reach 200 billion yuan, a massive amount that is unlikely to be approved. However, the existing tea loan plan of the China Farmers Bank already has detailed regulations for loan methods, percentages, conditions, etc. Therefore, it was decided that tea merchants should first propose improvement suggestions to the existing loan plan, so that it can be submitted to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval. At around 5 PM yesterday, the Shanghai Tea Export Association, the China Tea Association, and the Southeast Tea Region Tea Factory Federation, among other organizations, convened a joint meeting. Representatives from various organizations attended, chaired by Shou Jingwei, and discussed until the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to recommend that the authorities first request the China Farmers Bank to allocate 20 billion yuan from this year's 80 billion yuan tea loan for raw tea loans. This sum would be handed over to the China Tea Corporation, together with the China Farmers Bank, and the tea export associations in Shanghai, Hankou, and Fuzhou, as well as tea trade associations in various regions, to be lent separately according to the qualifications and production capacity of each tea factory. It is reported that this suggestion will be submitted by the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval.</p>
<h3>National Bank Hopes Tea Merchants Will Redeem Boxed Tea Used as Loan Collateral</h3>
<p>It is reported that the National Bank had stipulated that tea merchants who requested government-backed loans last year using boxed tea as collateral should redeem the goods with funds in the future and sell them themselves to promote exports. The National Bank still hopes that tea merchants will redeem and sell the tea to boost the export business. If the tea merchants are still unable to fulfill the agreement, the government will sell it on their behalf and then settle the outstanding debts with the tea merchants.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Carpet Exports to the US</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] Importers dealing with Chinese carpets told reporters that they have not imported Chinese carpets since the end of the war. Competition in the US market is more intense than before, the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender fluctuates, and US customs duties are also higher than before. Unless these issues are improved, importers will not resume trading in Chinese carpets.</p>

<h3>Deng Xihou Speaks Freely About Sichuan Politics</h3>
<p>— Chengdu, 14th (Air Dispatch) Our Newspaper Correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Since Chairman Zhang Yuejun of Sichuan Province requested leave of absence last year, personnel changes have been brewing, with many twists and turns. It was not until the government reorganization this time, with Chairman Zhang becoming the head of the Executive Yuan and Deng Xihou, who was acting as the provincial chairman, being summoned to Beijing, that the reorganization of the Sichuan situation became clear. Therefore, Chairman Deng's visit to Nanjing to report on his duties this time is of great importance to the future politics and construction of Sichuan. Chairman Deng's visit to Beijing has attracted increasing attention from those concerned about the Sichuan situation.</p>
<p>Reporting Duties in Nanjing</p>
<p>Extremely Fruitful Results</p>
<p>Chairman Deng was summoned to Beijing on the 29th of last month, stayed in Beijing for ten days, and returned to Chengdu by special plane on the 12th. On the afternoon of that day, despite the fatigue of the journey, he met with reporters and spoke freely about the process of reporting his duties in Beijing and the grand plan for the future construction of Sichuan, and answered various questions raised by the reporters.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Deng spoke in a very pleasant tone about his motivation for going to Beijing, which was to report to the central government on the military and political measures taken in Sichuan and Xikang in the past few months, as he had been acting chairman for eight months, and to request instructions on future construction plans. During his ten-day stay in Beijing, he met Chairman Chiang three times and Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, ministers of ministries and commissions, and central responsible officials many times. He discussed and consulted on the future direction of Sichuan's political measures and the promotion of economic construction, which was extremely fruitful. Concrete decisions were made on issues such as Sichuan's economic construction, political advancement, and ensuring social order in the future.</p>
<p>Principles for Building Sichuan</p>
<p>Chairman Announces Three Points</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang is most concerned about the construction of the new Sichuan and repeatedly encouraged Mr. Deng to make Sichuan a model province for the whole country and to play a leading role in construction. The Chairman also instructed three principles for building Sichuan: (1) Transforming the atmosphere, (2) Strengthening social order, (3) Actively promoting construction. Mr. Deng said, "The Chairman summoned me (Deng referred to himself) several times and urged me to work diligently and to encourage each other with a willingness to work hard without complaint." "Especially in transforming the atmosphere, such as strictly prohibiting opium and drugs and cracking down on undesirable organizations, there were clear instructions." At the same time, "Many central figures have traveled to Sichuan every year and regard Sichuan as their second hometown. They have high expectations for the construction of the new Sichuan and are happy to see it succeed." Mr. Deng believes that now is a golden opportunity for the construction of Sichuan, and the people of Sichuan should work together to build the province and live up to the Chairman's earnest expectations.</p>
<p>Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Central Government Fully Assists</p>
<p>Regarding the "Sichuan Construction Five-Year Plan," Chairman Deng spoke in an excited tone about the results of consultations on asking the central government to assist in its completion: "Sichuan's construction involves many aspects, and the Five-Year Plan is a whole, so the completion of the Five-Year Plan is the unanimous expectation of the people of Sichuan." "The most important thing for construction is funding. This time I went to Beijing with the full Five-Year Plan and discussed the funding issue with the Ministry of Finance. It was decided that the source of funding would be: (1) A portion raised by Sichuan Province itself, (2) Central government subsidies, (3) Use of foreign capital. Regarding the construction funds for the first year, the central government decided to provide subsidies and decided to fully assist Sichuan Province so that the Five-Year Plan can be completed on schedule."</p>
<p>Two Major Constructions</p>
<p>Actively Starting Construction and Repair</p>
<p>The two major post-war constructions in Sichuan that are of national concern - the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dujiangyan Power Plant - have already started construction, but the specific funding has not yet been finalized. One of the main tasks of Mr. Deng's trip to Beijing this time was to solve the entire funding problem for the two major projects. Mr. Deng happily spoke about the consultation process: "The central government is very concerned about the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The project funding was originally set at half from the central government and half from the local government. After repeated consultations with Minister Yu Dawei, it was decided that the entire 25 billion yuan would be borne by the central government. According to Minister Yu, the central government has already included 39 billion yuan for the civil engineering of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in this year's budget." "Regarding the French loan, because the interest rate issue has not yet been resolved, French representative Bansha arrived in Beijing last week and will sign the agreement with Director He Beiheng of the Sichuan Construction Department within the week." Regarding the construction of the Dujiangyan Power Plant, Mr. Deng said: "The Canadian government has expressed its hope that the Sichuan Provincial Government will send someone to Canada to discuss the matter. The Provincial Government is considering asking Mr. Lu Zuofu to go to Canada. The central government has already allocated 700 million yuan to ship the generators, and it is decided to generate 25,000 kilowatts first. In short, under the central government's concern and assistance, these two major constructions will be actively started, and it is expected that they will be completed within the time limit without any problems."</p>
<p>Developing Industries</p>
<p>Strengthening Sichuan's Industry</p>
<p>Another aspect of Sichuan's economic construction, which is currently the most urgent and practical need, is "developing Sichuan's industry and strengthening its industry." This was also one of Chairman Deng's tasks in Beijing. Mr. Deng and Mr. Zhang Gongquan and Mr. Weng Wenhao studied this several times and believed that "the important economic constructions that are easy to achieve should focus on developing Sichuan's inherent industries. I negotiated with the central government in Beijing and decided to ask the government to support Sichuan in developing foreign trade and increasing the production of tung oil, cotton, bristles, sugar, and salt." Mr. Deng continued, "Regarding strengthening Sichuan's industry, I have requested that relief supplies and Japanese reparations factories be allocated to Sichuan. The central government has now agreed to transfer the Weiyuan Iron Plant, the Zizhong Steel Plant, and the state-owned factories in Beibei, Chongqing, to provincial management. The generator factory and sulfuric acid factory from Japanese reparations will be allocated to Sichuan Province to lay the foundation for Sichuan's industrialization." "In order to coordinate the development of industry and industry, the central government will also develop Sichuan's transportation. In addition to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Tianshui-Chengdu and Sichuan-Guizhou Railways will also be built at the same time."</p>
<p>Ensuring Security</p>
<p>No Worries About Sichuan and Xikang's Defense</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Deng assured in a sincere tone: "The security of Sichuan and Xikang can be ensured, and the Sichuan and Xikang Pacification Headquarters will be temporarily retained to meet the needs of the times. In terms of strengthening local armed forces, we have requested the central government to subsidize weapons and ammunition to strengthen the strength of the garrison and security teams. At the same time, in the near future, it is impossible for the Communist Party to disturb Sichuan, and the remaining bandits and thieves lurking in Sichuan and Xikang will be completely eliminated in the short term." Regarding the Xikang issue, Mr. Deng replied: "The Chairman is very concerned about the recent situation in Xikang and has instructed me to tell Chairman Liu that he must work hard earnestly, especially in the prohibition of opium, which should be implemented earnestly."</p>
<p>From the confidence of this new chairman, coupled with the newly reorganized provincial government personnel, the reporter is looking forward to the bright prospects of Sichuan's political construction.</p>

<h3>From Xuzhou to Lincheng</h3>
<p>— Lincheng, 9th (Fast News) Our Newspaper Reporter Ling Songshou</p>
<p>Rickshaws are Antique and Elegant</p>
<p>Xuzhou really doesn't have anything to love. Yellow sand fills the sky and the earth, the people are crude, and the language is unpleasant to hear... When you first arrive in Xuzhou, it won't give you too good of an impression. If you must say what is lovable about it, then the rickshaws are quite good - that's my opinion. The rickshaws are inlaid with brass patterns and lace, which makes them look antique and elegant.</p>
<p>Chicken and Duck Soup with an Egg</p>
<p>The first time I went to Xuzhou to steam rice, it was very hard, but it suited my taste. This time I ate a "Sha".</p>
<p>It's really strange, a bowl of chicken and duck soup with an egg, and it's called by such a strange name "Sha". I drank a bowl and ate four large buns, and I didn't feel hungry until 3 PM.</p>
<p>Noise Everywhere, No Light at Night</p>
<p>Xuzhou is now an important military town. The sound of airplanes in the sky and the sound of car horns and engines on the road come and go, and it's all noisy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the municipal authorities felt that the dust on the road was too much to bear. In recent days, many roads have been hurriedly paved with cobblestones, which is a good phenomenon. However, in my opinion, Xuzhou is still Xuzhou. Even if its status becomes more important in the future, it will be difficult to change it into something like Nanjing and Shanghai due to its inherent conditions. Not to mention anything else, the shoe-shining business is very quiet here. The small stalls on the road pat the chairs and ask me, "Shine your shoes?" I look at the gusts of yellow sand in front of me and shake my head.</p>
<p>At night, there are no streetlights on the road, and it's all dark. A dozen rickshaws are connected together and run in a long snake formation on the wide and quiet road, which is another kind of flavor. Please don't be surprised, this is just like the crude pottery stalls under the five-story Western-style buildings, and the many people who are picking lice on their bodies. It is indeed Xuzhou's shortcomings, but it is also Xuzhou's charm.</p>
<p>There are two trains from Xuzhou to Lincheng every day, up and down. According to the timetable, the first train heading upwards is a mixed train between Xuzhou and Tengxian, which departs at 7:30. The second train is a third-class train between Pukou and Lincheng, which departs from Xuzhou at 10:25. In order to take the third-class train, the reporter did not hesitate to wait for several hours in vain, and took the second train. Who knew that the second train was still all freight cars. With the permission of the conductor, the reporter sat down on a leather suitcase in the guard car.</p>
<p>Car Vibration Creates a Funny Scene</p>
<p>In the same car with me was a certain major general officer from the Lunan Military Management District, and his family, a total of five people, two adults and three children. Because the machinery was being inspected, the guard car vibrated violently every time it stopped and started again. As a result, either the older brother fell down, or the younger sister fell down, or the younger brother being held in his arms hit his mother's forehead. Every time the car started, a performance was given, sometimes accompanied by crying and laughter. The reporter watched coldly and felt that this scene was quite interesting.</p>
<p>After passing Liuquan Station, we arrived at Liguo Station. This is the junction area of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, and the only iron production area in Jiangsu Province. There are many factories to the west of the station, but they have now become a dead silence, and no smoke can be seen coming out of the chimneys. Continuing northward, each bunker on the side of the road stood a sentry, staring ahead in a bayonet-style posture. To the right of the railway are rolling green hills, looming in the misty distance, and to the left is the Grand Canal, with misty waters flowing endlessly to the south. Everything is tense, but also quiet. All that can be heard is the sound of the wheels. Approaching Lincheng, the train passed through Mengjiazhuang and Hanzhuang stations, with broken walls and ruins, which was a shocking sight. Especially Mengjiazhuang Station, which used two carriages as offices, which was truly laughable.</p>
<p>No Lard in the Hotel</p>
<p>Lincheng is the junction of the Jinpu Railway and the Linzao branch line. Its importance and prosperity in the past can be imagined. But today, after being besieged by the Communist army for eighteen months after the victory, the Linzao branch line was repaired and then suffered a second destruction. Although the Jinpu Railway main line has been connected to Tengxian, all that the two mixed trains bring every day are returning refugees, nothing else. Most of the houses in the town have been destroyed. The houses at the station are the three that survived the overturning of the nest. A water tower as high as several tens of feet can no longer be used... Destruction and poverty are seriously attacking it. The population of the whole town is about 15,300, and food is extremely scarce. Pork at 3,500 yuan per catty seems cheap to us, but I am afraid that no local people here will pay such a high price to buy it. I ate a meal in a small hotel. There was no lard. When I asked the boss, he said that the small amount of lard produced every day was reserved for the families of the troops.</p>
<p>My first goal in coming to Lincheng was to visit General Li Yutang, the commander of the Xuyan Pacification Zone, who was said to be stationed here. In addition, I also wanted to see what the situation was like because I heard that many refugees were gathered here.</p>
<p>Work Team's Main Relief Work</p>
<p>But I was disappointed. General Li has now moved to Tengxian, and the refugees have already returned to their hometowns one after another. The reporter went through the streets and alleys and found the location of the Lunan Office of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Lunan Branch. I handed in my card, and the one who came out to meet me was Gao Qingya, the head of the relief stock of the second work team in the area. After talking, I learned that the Lunan Office had moved to Xuzhou, and the team was staying here to continue carrying out relief work. The area of work for this team is the area on both sides of the railway from Tengxian to Yanzhou. They have held these two general accounts in Lincheng: The first time was at the end of last year, and a total of 4,124 bags of relief flour, 10,054 pieces of old clothing, and 3,561,000 yuan in relief funds were issued. The second time was between January and March of this year, and a total of 1,895 bags of relief flour were issued. At present, their main task is to handle emergency relief and work relief in the recovered areas. The ones that have already been issued are: 2,000 bags to Yixian County, 4,500 bags to Yanzhou, and 500 bags to Zou County. However, due to insufficient funds, it is not possible to directly send them to the counties and districts, and only the requesting agencies are asked to move them themselves. Furthermore, due to the inconvenience of transportation, the relief flour that Yanzhou should have received has not yet been moved. In terms of work relief, it is currently being implemented on the canal embankment from Jining to Jining. For every cubic foot of earth dug, 2.5 catties of flour can be obtained. At most, each person can dig ten cubic feet a day, and can get a reward of 25 catties of flour, which is not bad.</p>
<p>Small Game of World Peace</p>
<p>At the time when the refugees gathered, there were about 300 orphans received here, with the aim of implementing education and care. Now, because they have returned to their hometowns one after another, there are only more than 30 students left.</p>
<p>There is nothing else to record about my stay in Lincheng except for one very interesting thing. That is: groups of two or three children on the street use scissors, paper, and stones to play a game and write the four characters "World Peace". Each time they win, they add a stroke. Whoever finishes writing first is the winner. Before everyone stretches out their small fists to compare the outcome, they shout in their mouths: "World Peace". However, when can there be peace? I think: This should not only be the cry of children!</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province Excerpts</h3>
<p>— Chiayi, 4th (Air Dispatch) Di Dong</p>
<p>The architecture and structure of houses in Taiwan are worth mentioning. Generally speaking, the construction of houses is mainly based on wood, but the structure and design are very exquisite and practical. Each residential building has a living room, study, and sanitary facilities. Most doors and windows use glass, which is convenient to open and close, and the air flow is particularly smooth. The area occupied by a building is always more than several acres, so there are spacious courtyards and open spaces. The streets and general shops are also commendable for being clean and wide, and there are evergreen trees planted on both sides of the road, with cars driving in the middle and people walking on both sides, and the order is well-maintained. When I first arrived in Taipei, I deeply admired Taipei's urban construction, which is not only advanced but also successful, because it has the flavor of a garden city and divides the commercial and residential areas so rigorously. When we look down on the entire city from the plane, it will naturally make you feel that there are both the grand scale of a city and the fun of a garden, with lovely green trees planted in every corner of the city.</p>
<p>Convenient Water and Electricity, Comfortable Housing</p>
<p>Although the first thing that most people who come from the mainland feel is the most unpleasant thing about living is the trouble of taking off shoes when entering the living room or bedroom, after some days of getting used to it, it doesn't feel like much. Now, the public and education personnel who have come here from the mainland have such low salaries that it is difficult for a family of several people to make ends meet. Rather than saying that everyone is willing to live this difficult life, it can be said that they feel that the climate here is pleasant, the water and electricity are convenient, and the housing is comfortable. Taking the house I live in as an example, it was originally second- or third-rate, but some time ago, friends actually joked and said: Your house is even better than the ones occupied by ministers during the war in Chongqing. Indeed, in the Japanese era, in order to encourage the Japanese to come to Taiwan and plunder our resources in Taiwan to provide them with capital for aggression, the Japanese government gave special preferential treatment to the personnel who came to Taiwan. The Japanese ruling era organized a huge construction organization, which was the main agency dedicated to solving the problem of stable housing for the Japanese after they came to Taiwan. All Japanese who came to Taiwan could borrow money from the construction organization according to the level of their position to build houses, and the required construction costs could be paid in installments. Because there was an agency that helped immigrants solve the housing problem, ordinary public officials at the recommendation level (naturally, those who were commissioned also had them) had relatively spacious and well-equipped dormitories. As for the heads of various departments, there were also official residences provided. After the restoration, the public and education personnel who came from our mainland took over their houses and indeed enjoyed a lot of the benefits.</p>
<p>Thrifty and Hardworking, Used to Eating Cold Rice</p>
<p>The compatriots who have been under long-term Japanese rule have not only changed their customs and habits, but have even completely learned the spirit of hard work and endurance of the Japanese nation. The thrifty and hardworking life of the Taiwanese people is something that will make us admire. Ordinary people, like people in the mainland, still eat three meals a day, but most of them only cook one meal in the morning, and no longer cook at noon and night. They have a habit of eating cold rice. Taking ordinary Taiwanese public and education personnel as an example, they prepare about one or two bowls of rice every morning before going to work, put it in a "white iron box" with very limited vegetables, called "Bento". After getting off work, they eat it like wolves in the office, without soup or water. Secondly, the clothes they wear are also very casual. Men like to wear suits, but they don't pay much attention to them. Most of them don't wear ties, and their shirts are not clean, and rarely ironed until they are shiny. As for women, they are used to wearing skirts and suits, and they don't look bad. If they are of good figure, they have a kind of healthy and beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>Various Types of Working Women</p>
<p>People who have not been here all think that the women in Taiwan are particularly enchanting and flirtatious. Some people even advised their wives who had already come here to hurry up and catch up, otherwise, it would be difficult to guarantee that their husbands would not be robbed by Taiwanese women. I have personally seen many wives who, based on this idea, took great risks and sailed light boats to come here. In fact, Taiwanese women are not as rumored. Young girls do have the habit and interest of working, so in the city, various types of women with different occupations have emerged, such as so-called groups of "waiters" in hotels, "maids" in hotels who serve guests, girls working as laborers in government agencies, and "maids" who cook and wash clothes in official residences, and they are all dressed fashionably and wear makeup. However, except for those in hotels and inns who can be teased and played with by guests due to the driving force of life, the "maids" and "laborers" can be said to be honest, hardworking, and earning meager wages to maintain the lives of several families. The general age of the above-mentioned working girls is between 25 and 17 or 18 years old, so people who come from the mainland at first are very surprised to see them, and their attitude and behavior seem so innocent, no, it should be said that they are frivolous and graceful, and even allow guests to tease them very casually and naturally. This is all a legacy of the Japanese era. It is said that unmarried women are indeed more casual, but when they choose an object, or even after they get married, they are unusually strict and disciplined. At present, the girls who work as laborers in government agencies are really careful and serious when they do things. Therefore, after the restoration, whether it is the central or local agencies, most of them still follow the old habits of using female workers.</p>

<p>A Proposal for Resolving the Rice Shortage in the City</p>
<p>Recently, a rice shortage has occurred in the city, causing extreme social unrest. Many citizens advocate that the government should promptly suppress rice prices. I believe that merely suppressing rice prices will not only fail to alleviate the rice shortage but will also cut off rice sources, leading to a more serious situation.</p>
<p>Currently, the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs is working hard on rice rationing. However, whether rationing can be fair and universal, and whether the working masses will suffer losses in terms of time and energy, are all questionable. Therefore, I believe that rationing can only play a passive role and is not a good solution to the rice shortage.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not a rice-producing area but is located on the edge of rice-producing areas. Therefore, the only solution to the rice shortage is to facilitate the flow of rice. The government should encourage rice merchants to go to Wuxi and other rice-producing areas to purchase rice. The government should provide assistance within its power in terms of financial accommodation and transportation convenience, while limiting their due profits and preventing rice merchants from reaping excessive profits. At the same time, attention should be paid to the quantity of rice entering and exiting the city to prevent hoarding.</p>
<p>What should be especially noted is that large-scale purchases by Shanghai rice merchants in rice-producing areas can also stimulate local rice prices. Therefore, the government should do its best to purchase imported rice to supplement the supply. As the season of food scarcity approaches, it is hoped that the government will quickly take effective measures to eliminate hidden worries. (Wu Xinbao)</p>
<p>At the same time, letters from readers Chen Liguan and Huaibao, among others, called for the same thing and will no longer be published.</p>
<p>A Call for Living Expenses for Public Education Personnel</p>
<p>Editor: I am a poor civil servant. To say that the salary level is too low is not very low. The base salary is 140 yuan, and the salary including the current in-kind distribution difference amounts to 400,000. Before March, it was barely possible to maintain a family of three with a meager income, but with the current prices, there is a huge difference. It is difficult to maintain even a bowl of porridge and a meal. This is not a plea to the government for poverty relief but a request for the government to add some subsidies. I think a civil servant has to go to work at 8:30 a.m. every day and does not leave until 5:00 p.m. Being late or leaving early will be punished. If things are done wrong, they will be subject to disciplinary action depending on the severity of the circumstances. This is the government's rectification of officialdom, of course, it should be so, and civil servants should also be diligent in their duties for the government. Then the government should also take responsibility for the lives of civil servants and provide reasonable maintenance so that it can revive the spirit of civil servants in handling affairs. The current prices have risen so high, and the government has not yet had an effective way to suppress them, and the adjustment of treatment is still under discussion. Civil servants are already starving to the point of dying. I hope that the adjustment method will be formulated and implemented as soon as possible! (Hu Yan)</p>
<p>Another Letter: In recent days, prices have soared endlessly, and the lives of colleagues have become increasingly difficult and unsustainable. It has been found that Zhenjiang is located between Nanjing and Shanghai, and the prices of local products are higher than those in Nanjing, while the prices of foreign goods are higher than those in Shanghai. However, when the treatment was adjusted last year, Zhenjiang was listed as a second-class city, which is obviously unfair. Colleagues have always adhered to the principle of enduring poverty, and although they once raised objections, they did not pursue them further. Now the pressure of high prices is even greater, and the desire for adjustment is even more urgent. It is hoped that the facts will be taken into account and that it will be listed in the same rank as the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. Otherwise, it will be difficult to settle down to work.

<h3>Zuo Wenxiang in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zongyu</p>
<p>By Qin Hancai, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>There is a very important question that has been a pending case for thousands of years and has never been properly resolved. What is this question? It is the Northwest question. Theoretically, the Northwest is the birthplace of the Chinese nation, and the Northwest question was originally an internal problem of China, a very important internal problem. However, for thousands of years, everyone has regarded it as a border issue, and the way of dealing with it is generally no more than three kinds. The first is to solve it by force. When the country is rich and strong, it uses overwhelming force to suppress the Northwest. The pressure is effective, and at most it is appeased, but no thorough work is done. For example, Ban Chao of the Han Dynasty, who guarded the Western Regions, is an example. The second is a policy of appeasement, using the Confucian advocacy of "continuing the extinct lineage, raising the abandoned country, governing chaos and maintaining danger, paying tribute on time, being generous in giving and stingy in receiving," to maintain the dignity of the Celestial Dynasty. The third is to close the door and not ask questions, temporarily severing relations. In a word, all dynasties have regarded the Northwest as a border issue and never regarded it as an internal issue.</p>
<p>The former Qing Dynasty spent a lot of effort on the Northwest. Zuo Zongtang was the person in charge of this work. Mr. Qin Hancai has a research interest in the life history of Zuo Zongtang, collecting Zuo Zongtang's materials and conducting in-depth research, which has been going on for ten years. Using modern eyes, he has carefully sorted out, analyzed and synthesized, and recently published a part of the research results on Zuo's management of the Northwest, entitled "Zuo Wenxiang Gong in the Northwest," which is divided into twelve chapters. In addition to the military pacification of Shaanxi and Gansu and the recovery of Xinjiang, there are very detailed descriptions and evaluations of financial facilities, civil administration facilities, economic facilities, and educational facilities. In the chapter on financial facilities, it is further divided into eight sections: analysis of expenses for the Western Expedition, reorganization of land taxes, reorganization of salt affairs, reorganization of tea affairs, reorganization of likin, organizing donations, organizing foreign debts, and reorganization of the currency system; the chapter on civil administration facilities is further divided into eight sections such as rectifying officialdom, invigorating the political style, famine relief, and the policy of prohibiting opium and benefiting the people; the chapter on economic facilities is further divided into four sections such as opening canals and wells, revitalizing agriculture, animal husbandry, and sericulture, and establishing machine weaving and gold mining; the chapter on educational facilities is further divided into four sections: academies, charity schools, printing books, and examinations. The above chapters are all political work, which can be regarded as a rough scale at that time. This method can be regarded as correcting the previous prejudice of regarding the Northwest question as a border issue and formally regarding it as an internal issue of China. This is where Zuo Zongtang differed from Zhang Qian and Ban Chao. Mr. Qin's book can also be regarded as revealing the true face of Zuo Zongtang.</p>
<p>In Chinese history, Zuo should be re-evaluated, which is the greatest feature of Mr. Qin's work! And the last chapter, "A General Review of Zuo Gong's Management of the Northwest," is even more the result of Mr. Qin's research, listing the major issues such as the relationship between the rise and fall of national defense and military force and the governance of the Northwest, the reasons why political achievements cannot be great, the lack of talents in the successors, the Northwest of national defense, the people as the foundation of the country, the causes and consequences of exile, the essentials of enriching the population, and the suffering and need for improvement in transportation, the need for the central government's determination and the burden of the national treasury for the construction of the Northwest, the primary importance of large and long-distance transportation tools hindering the completion of the construction of the Northwest since ancient times, and the paramount importance of political integrity, etc., are all the main opinions for thoroughly solving the Northwest question in the future. Therefore, this book is not only a reconstruction of Zuo Zongtang's historical status but also the most valuable reference material for building the Northwest, and it is worth a solemn introduction to those who are enthusiastic about studying the Northwest question.</p>
<h3>Developmental Psychology</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Author: Zuo Xueli</p>
<p>Publisher: Commercial Press (University Series)</p>
<p>Publication Date: June 1946</p>
<p>Books on developmental psychology, except for the translation of H. L. Hollingworth's "Mental Growth and Decline" (translated by Zhao Yan), are rare in the domestic publishing industry. Zuo Xueli's new book is the manuscript she compiled and wrote at the National Northwest Normal College. The author studied under Professor F. N. Freeman and adopted a lot of materials from Professor Freeman.</p>
<p>Anyone who studies education should not ignore the discipline of developmental psychology. Life from embryo to old age is a developmental process, so Western educators such as Comenius, Pestalozzi, and Rousseau all advocate that the educational viewpoint should be based on the natural development of children or on the laws of children's psychological development. The naturalistic educational philosophy of the eighteenth century even contained the concept of developmental psychology. In modern times, influenced by the development of evolution, child psychology, and comparative psychology, the study of developmental psychology has become a more general trend. In fact, it is not only those who study education who need this knowledge, but anyone who wants to obtain references for self-cultivation should also understand the content of the process of life development.</p>
<p>The first five chapters discuss generalities, and then describe by period</p>
<p>The publication of this book is indeed urgently needed today. Regardless of the collection and compilation of materials, the book is sufficient to enable the general public, especially those who study education, to obtain a clear basic concept and understand the entire process of life development. It is indeed as Professor Hu Yi said in the preface, "The segmented arguments are detailed and careful." I feel that although Hollingworth's book is detailed, it is still inevitably trivial, and it may not be entirely suitable for beginners who want to know the concept of developmental psychology, while Zuo Jun's "Developmental Psychology" is concise and appropriate, and most beneficial to beginners.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into twelve chapters. The first five chapters generally discuss the general principles of development, and from the sixth chapter onwards, the development of each stage of life is described in turn. The main points of each chapter are described as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1, "Introduction," describes the scientific background of developmental psychology, the meaning and scope of developmental psychology, and provides a detailed description of the concept of development, as well as the various methods for studying developmental psychology.</p>
<p>Heredity and environment: which is more decisive?</p>
<p>Chapter 2, "Heredity Determinism and Its Criticism," the author gives a concise description of Galton's and Terman's studies of geniuses, K. Pearson's family similarity studies, E.L. Thorndike's, C. Werriman's, and N.D. Hirseh's twin similarity studies, and H.G. Muller's monozygotic twin studies, and then criticizes them.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, "Environmental Determinism and Its Criticism," the main basis of argument is Watson's school of behavior psychology. This school is an absolutely uncompromising environmental determinist. In addition, most of those who study environmental issues do not completely deny psychological heredity, but put forward evidence of the significant impact of the acquired environment on human achievement to disprove absolute heredity. The book cites the research of J-Mek Catteh, H. Gordon, S.M. Stoke, Freeman, and K.J. Holzinger. The author's criticism believes that the fact of heredity cannot be erased by theoretical denial. Heredity and environment really influence each other in the development of human psychology.</p>
<p>Several stages of life: the characteristics of psychological development</p>
<p>Chapter 4, "General Characteristics and Facts of Development," tells us that development is the result of the interaction and simultaneous action of the two factors of heredity and environment, and it includes a continuous process.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, "Germ Plasm and Fetal Period," explains the physiological basis of development and the factors and stages that determine the development of egg cells, and discusses the germ plasm problem based on Mendel's law of heredity. Finally, it also talks about two important principles of body structure and function, namely the law of development direction and the law of Cephalocandal development. Fetal reaction behavior and prenatal education are also discussed.</p>
<p>Please pay attention to children: the study of behavioral psychology</p>
<p>Chapter 7, "The First Three Years of Preschool Age," describes the development of intelligence after the age of three. Regarding the development of social attitudes and behaviors, it provides many valuable materials. The author introduces Bridges' publication on children's social behavior, which can be used as an important reference for improving the development of children's social behavior.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, "The Activity Period," is a very important stage from the age of six. When children enter this stage, the scope of activities becomes wider and their abilities increase. To guide or control their activities or behaviors, it is necessary to understand the motives of their behaviors first. This chapter broadly discusses the interests of children in this period and the development of social concepts and moral concepts.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, "Youth Period," makes a very detailed discussion of the developmental characteristics and significance of youth, the physical development, emotional development, and social relationship development of youth. The book indicates the main points of youth physical and mental hygiene, emotional cultivation, and sex education, which parents and teachers should pay attention to, and which youth should strive to practice.</p>
<p>Before the age of fifty: no decline in learning ability</p>
<p>Chapter 10, "Adult Period," describes the physical and mental development after the age of twenty. The author synthesizes the research of various families, and takes Thorndike's adult learning experiment as the main basis, emphasizing that there is no significant decline in learning ability before the age of fifty. The differences between the emotions and social behaviors of adults and those of previous periods are also described very clearly.</p>
<p>Finally, Chapter 11, "Old Age," is the period of decline in life. Not only is there physiological decline, but also intelligence and various abilities show decline. The difference between the emotions of this period and those of the past is that mental errors are most likely to cause mental illness. The book analyzes the causes of mental illness in the elderly and lists various different symptoms of mental illness. Finally, it points out that mental hygiene is particularly important for the elderly, and ensuring the happiness and social utility of the elderly is indeed a problem worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Beneficial to self-cultivation: widely adopts the results of experiments</p>
<p>In summary, the advantages of this book are that it is concise and to the point, and it can extensively cite and collect the theories of various families without omission. It can also benefit life cultivation, integrating theory and practice in one furnace. It adopts new and old experimental research on the various problems discussed and makes objective criticisms, which is different from the views of one family. It also discusses the literature related to developmental psychology in other disciplines such as biology, anthropology, ethics, and criminology, so that researchers can obtain a whole and connected concept. Finally, the collection of materials in the two chapters on adults and the elderly is especially difficult, because this stage has always been less studied, and there is not much readily available information to adopt, but Zuo Jun has expressed many unique insights here. As for the rigorous organization and clear system of this book, it is rare in domestic psychological works. Also, because each stage of life development is continuous, the description in this book can take into account the connection between each stage (the chapter-by-chapter description is only for convenience), and it is consistent from beginning to end, which is another feature.</p>
<h3>Outline of Commercial Law</h3>
<p>— Luo Gengsheng</p>
<p>Author: Huang Fangyan</p>
<p>Printer: Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Distributor: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>According to recent publications of various bookstores, there are very few books for businessmen to read. The reason is very simple, because businessmen are engaged in business and have no spare time to read books. In fact, this view is wrong! Many businessmen are very willing to absorb new knowledge in their spare time, and the reason why businessmen do not read books now is that these books do not suit their taste and needs. The purpose of businessmen reading books is different from that of ordinary young students. Students only care about their own interests, while businessmen require practicality!</p>
<p>What do businessmen need? This question is very simple. They hope to know how to trade and deal with people; and to know how the country protects their business, so that they can engage in business activities as much as possible under protection without danger. These are all issues of commercial law.</p>
<p>Since the opening of trade with various countries, business has become increasingly complex. In this era, if a businessman does not have a little common sense of commercial law, then he may not be able to cope with this complex environment and unexpected events, thus affecting his business prospects. In this way, commercial law and businessmen are closely related, and the study of commercial law is also needed by businessmen! However, China's commercial law imitates the Swiss system of civil and commercial law unity, and the provisions of commercial law are mostly incorporated into the civil law, so that it is difficult for businessmen to start even if they want to study it. Recently, there is a book called "Outline of Commercial Law" by Huang Fangyan, which summarizes the overview of commercial law without omission. It is worth reading for businessmen and those who are preparing to engage in business.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into seven chapters. The main points of the book are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Meaning of Commercial Law From the old-style commercial situation in China, it talks about the importance of commercial law now, and at the same time explains that customs, precedents, and legal provisions are the sources of commercial law.</p>
<p>(2) Contract Contract is the main topic of commercial law, so the material is very rich, and it is divided into ten sections: the types of contracts, the cause of the contract, the offer and acceptance, the expression of intent, the capacity for action, the contract should be legal, the intention should be consistent, the effect of the contract, the rescission of the contract, and the interpretation of the contract. In addition to explaining the conditions for the conclusion of the contract, it also provides a detailed explanation of the legal effect of the contract.</p>
<p>(3) Commercial Relationship It includes issues such as the types and powers of agents, the formation of partnerships and the responsibilities of partners, and the types of companies and the powers of shareholders.</p>
<p>(4) Contribution and Sale This is the most important mode of conduct in commerce, and it is also a kind of non-formal contract. A store, a company, cannot do without buying and selling. There are many problems in buying and selling. Businessmen who do not understand the law may have troubles and twists and turns at any time.</p>
<p>(5) Transportation of Goods The next step after buying and selling is transportation. The procedures for transportation, insurance, and the responsibilities of both parties can all be used as a memorandum for businessmen.</p>
<p>(6) Negotiable Instruments What is circulating in the commercial field now are negotiable instruments. There are three types of negotiable instruments: drafts, checks, and promissory notes. The meaning of various negotiable instruments, the way of circulation and transfer, and the responsibilities of the drawer and the handler are also essential knowledge for modern businessmen.</p>
<p>(7) Maritime Law Maritime transportation of goods, foreign trade, sailors, ships, ship collisions, rescue and salvage, and general average are also regulations that import and export and shipping merchants must be familiar with.</p>
<p>The characteristic of this book is that it emphasizes both theory and facts. Every theory must be attached to facts for reference. Originally, law is nothing more than theory, and theory is nothing more than human relations, and human relations are the crystallization of local customs and habits. These facts are not fabricated by the author, but are precedents from various countries, so that readers can not only get the training of legal theory, but also get practical experience because of the reference of facts.</p>

<h3>Review of "China and America"</h3>

<p>China and America, By Foster Rhea Dules, Princeton University Press, 1946, 277 pp.</p>
<p>There are several famous Western books on the history of China's foreign relations? Such as H-B-Morse's The International Relations of the Chinese Empire and Macnair's Far Eastern International Relation-ms, etc. However, as far as I know, there are simply no special books that specifically discuss the history of Sino-US relations. Judging from the close and complex relationship between China and the United States, this cannot but be regarded as a pity. The publication of Dules's "China and America" obviously makes up for this deficiency, because it is a narrative of the history of Sino-US relations. Therefore, we feel that this book is quite valuable.</p>
<p>This book starts with the first US ship coming to China for trade in 1784 and ends with the end of World War II, General Marshall's visit to China, and the closing of the Political Consultative Conference. The whole book focuses on official relations, and does not talk much about the trade between the two countries and the circulation of religion and culture. However, the advantage of this book lies in this: it is not specialized, it is interesting, it is concise, and it is suitable for general readers.</p>
<p>One point of this book worth mentioning is the author's goodwill towards China. The author avoids quoting and making criticisms unfavorable to China as much as possible. I am not saying that we are unwilling to accept unfavorable criticisms. I think that at least in terms of the author's intention, it is worthy of our gratitude.</p>
<p>The author has frankly admitted that the American people cannot escape responsibility for China's former semi-colonial status. But he believes that if the "United States abandoned various privileges based on the most-favored-nation clause at that time, it would not necessarily be beneficial to China. Such a sacrifice will sooner or later force the United States to withdraw from the Far East, and make China groan even more under the control of Western imperialism. (Page 68)"</p>
<p>But in any case, we cannot deny that the United States is China's most friendly country in the history of China's foreign relations. This point is particularly emphasized by the author in this book. In addition to quoting the remarks of Sino-US friendship from the official and civilian sides everywhere, he also proves it with facts. Here we may as well ask: Why is the United States particularly friendly to China? We feel that in addition to the fact that Americans are full of justice, commercial issues are the most important reason. The author once said that "the potential purchasing power of 400 million customers makes (the United States) being friendly to the Chinese people a very worthwhile thing. (Page 188)"</p>
<p>Although Dules's book is only an outline of the history of Sino-US relations, it is still a scholarly work. Therefore, the author omits the footnotes, which we think is very regrettable. In addition, although the bibliography is quite good, it ignores many important works. In particular, the great work of Dr. HB-Morse mentioned above was not included, which is a flaw.</p>
<h3>Martina</h3>
<p>— Written by Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Byerner, translated by Lin Ke, Cultural Life Publishing House</p>
<p>If you don't like strong, rich wine, and only love drinking light green tea, then I want to recommend this small, pastoral book—"Martina," a quiet, sentimental drama in five scenes.</p>
<p>In that July, in the desolate midday of a summer village, on the main road to Tonggang Mountain, next to a small apple tree, the simple and beautiful farm girl Martina meets a young man named Ru Su. After some conversation, it turns out that this young soldier, just returned from Syria, is the grandson of Old Mrs. Maifang, Martina's neighbor across the street. They chat very congenially, no, not just congenially, Ru Su feels that he has already fallen in love with Tonggang Mountain, even though he is still lingering on the main road to Tonggang Mountain. The hour has passed noon, he pretends to be a sick and wounded soldier, and walks to Tonggang Mountain with Martina's arm, like a pair of lovers. Half a month later, Old Mrs. Maifang at home often talks to her grandson about marriage matters. The elderly value etiquette, but young Ru Lian doesn't care about this. He is willful and only remembers enjoying the moment. As for the poor Martina, although he is captivated by her, he regards her as nothing more than a roadside willow or a wall flower. But later, he gets engaged to Shanna, an old friend of his, a learned and well-matched twenty-year-old girl. Autumn comes, and the autumn of the heart also comes. The small apple tree by the roadside has already shed its green buds and leaves. Joy ends, love withers. In the dusk of October, heartbroken Martina sits by the roadside, immersed in reverie, the autumn colors in her blurred eyes, the hazy spring dreams of the past, the faithful Afulei proposes to her, but she is completely unmoved. She only thinks of Ru Lian, Ru Lian, who is engaged to Shanna. He is no longer in Tonggang Mountain. Does he still remember her? A few days of sweet talk are like fleeting clouds to him, but in this girl's simple heart, no one would have imagined how deep a mark it would leave. Poor Martina, Ru Lian and Shanna got married. Not only does she not get the person she loves, but she is often called upon to comfort her lover's wife, because when Ru Su is not in Tonggang Mountain, Shanna needs her company, because she feels that she can find her own husband in Martina, as if he had left a trace of himself in this girl, like leaving something on a book he loved or a puppy he played with; but when Ru Su returns, he feels that she is superfluous. Poor Martina. What is even more pitiful is that even this bit of warmth in suffering is not enjoyed, Ru Lian and Shanna leave Tonggang Village and move to another place. After Martina has shed enough tears of sorrow, she agrees to Old Mrs. Maifang's persuasion and marries Afulei. She understands that she not only has no good fortune to enjoy the happiness of love, but even the pain of love is not destined for her. A year later, it is the late evening of a bleak winter, the desolate and sorrowful twilight. Martina and Ru Lian meet again. At this time, she is already Afulei's wife and is also pregnant. Old Mrs. Maifang has passed away. Ru Yun returns to Tonggang to take care of the funeral and sell his grandmother's house. He wears filial piety and sees the woman he loved for a few days a year ago in that simple farmhouse. He is suddenly moved. The past pleasures... brilliance... youth... the laughter of wild joy... the true and false love... he remembers it all. He is moved and says many things to Martina, things that, in principle, need not be mentioned again, to relive old feelings, nothing else, this selfish person is just reliving old feelings. Martina cries. The tears that she has spent so much time and pain enduring for so long flow for him again. This selfish person says goodbye to her again, maybe a permanent goodbye, but maybe not. However, Martina's story is over, the story of Martina and Ru Lian is over...</p>
<p>What is not over is the quenched desire and prolonged suffering left to people, how much gloom and how much despair, and how much lingering...</p>
<p>What a plain story, you might say. But it gives people such an extraordinary feeling of intimacy and truth, you will experience it. Just like on a drizzling spring night, hearing the distant flute playing the desolate "Zhaojun's Lament" will not make you cry, or even shed tears, but it will give you a profound sense of desolation and lingering melancholy. It is not like fine wine that intoxicates people, but like green tea that gives people endless aftertaste. It is the fragrance of flowers, not the color of flowers. It is a lightly sketched Chinese landscape painting, with no amazing strokes from beginning to end, but every stroke is amazing.</p>
<p>Regarding the author John Jacques Bernard, according to the translator's preface to this book, we know that he is the eldest son of the comedian Tristan Bernard, born in the suburbs of Paris on July 30, 1888. He spent his childhood in Paris, and later entered the University of Paris. By the end of 1936, he had already published more than twenty plays and four or five novels, and was, together with H.R. Lenormand, a builder and representative writer of new French drama. "Martina" has a reputation as a "model play." It does not pursue bizarre formats, and resists conventions that bind the spirit. It only seeks originality in the usual format. As the translator says: "Bernard feels deeply, reveals little, and retains taste and chastity..."</p>
<h3>Worries</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Random Notes on Life, Part Two</p>
<p>Blake has a line: "In every face I meet, marks of weakness, marks of woe." This line of poetry is a true portrayal of the people in our current situation. Regardless of new or old acquaintances, regardless of the poor or the wealthy, the old or the young, regardless of their living conditions, everyone carries the marks of worry. "Though the species of unhappiness may differ, yet you meet with it everywhere." (Bertrand Russell)</p>
<p>Every occasion is filled with quarrels, from tall buildings, tea shops, dance halls, theaters to crowded carriages, there is constant quarreling. It's truly a matter of holding grudges over trivial matters. Even a slight touch of clothing evokes fiery glares that seem to devour you. Those going to the theater, supposedly seeking pleasure, almost daily quarrel with the box office, and stare at each other. One must constantly be wary of unexpected guests rushing in, like facing a formidable enemy, and be careful that "when the city gate catches fire," one doesn't become collateral damage. Every tram stop is like a major event about to happen. When a car arrives, the flood of people, charging and climbing through windows, stepping on feet, knocking over children, always causes some kind of accident to spice up the dull, dirty car. From the moment we open our eyes until late at night, what we see, hear, and encounter are these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the noise of "distress" and "irritation," there is another side of human nature, a psychology of suspicion, forgetfulness, and jealousy. Every occasion is like a gathering to settle disputes, with knives hidden in sleeves, wanting to harm you, to get rid of you. In short, relationships between people disappear in struggle, and the whole society becomes like Luoma Lake, seeing who is "formidable."</p>
<p>In this way, there is "no such thing as faith," no "central idea"; your teacher is trampled under my feet, and my teacher is trod on his foot; even one's own teacher is only a temporary tool, and can be sold for the benefit of thirteen dollars. It is said that love is sacred, but the gold of this world has long faded, and romance is just a game. As the Roman historian Gibbon said, "History is little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind." Nothing else!</p>
<p>This is our real "worry," we are born into such worry. In the past, we thought that what kept us on tenterhooks was "internal and external troubles," but now we understand that we are really living in "heart troubles." As Samuel said, "Are we content to watch this world tear itself again into dog-like factions, the Epicurean and the Stoic?" Alas,</p>

<h3>The Army Man Who Draws Talismans and Incantations</h3>
<p>— Ji Gan</p>
<p>A tall man in military uniform was accused of rape. However, he claimed that upon seeing that the woman appeared to have a nervous disorder, he took her to a hotel to treat her. This secret remedy of his, it is said, was learned from an old Taoist priest ten years ago: many talismans and incantations. The judge asked him to write out the talismans in court to see if they were "genuine." Unexpectedly, he actually drew a talisman and also wrote a few incantations, "He he yang yang, the sun rises in the east, your disciple respectfully invites the Taoist master..."</p>
<p>The woman in question is said to have become "infatuated" due to "unrequited love," which is already abnormal enough. And the man she encountered, besides confessing that his lower body was disabled and unable to perform the act, can also draw talismans and chant incantations. Seeing these strange things put together really makes one feel like, what age is this?</p>
<p>Not long ago, an old woman dressed as a man was called a transvestite because of her indecent behavior, fraud, and drug use suspicions. In fact, this is just a criminal (as can be seen from the court's conviction). The real monsters, however, are in other places.</p>
<p>Originally, the so-called monsters are nothing more than two explanations: strangeness and calamity. All strange things can be called monsters. However, the most important thing is whether there is magic. Only those with magic can be called monsters, otherwise they are just strange. People with strange tempers are called eccentrics, and strangely shaped stones are called grotesque rocks. None of these should be regarded as enchanting people or stones. As for a type of person who uses deceptive words to mislead the public, charms people with magic, claims to be able to predict the future, and chants incantations, making people feel as if deities have descended to earth, to the point of using all methods that violate common sense and science to "guide the lost," this type of person, although their clothes and daily life are the same as ordinary people, can also be called a monster. Furthermore, anyone who believes in this kind of magic is bound to be infected with monstrous energy, and anyone who seems to see monsters everywhere is bound to be wearing a pair of monstrous glasses. Because fundamentally speaking, there is no such thing as a real monster in this world. One kind of monster is pretending to be a god or a ghost, and the other kind is suspecting the existence of gods and ghosts.</p>
<p>Let's try to open our eyes and see, how many of these monsters are there? When will Mr. Science bring a hundred thousand elite troops to China and sweep away all this monstrous energy! Here, the writer hopes that the army man who draws talismans and chants incantations, as well as the people who watch him draw talismans and listen to him chant incantations, although he performs "as if it were a real thing" in court, it is not really "a serious matter."</p>
<h3>How to Teach Your Child</h3>
<p>— Translated by Meng Lin</p>
<p>(3) The Transformation of the Moth</p>
<p>Like many young and mischievous children, I often ran to my mother for help whenever I encountered tricky difficulties, but my mother always let me solve them myself. I didn't understand what she meant by refusing me until one day I saw a moth wriggling in its cocoon, as if gasping for breath. I presumptuously cried out and began to take out the small knife in my pocket to cut open the cocoon, so that the moth could come out more easily. My mother turned around and watched me perform the surgery. When I discovered that the moth would not fly and was greatly disappointed, my mother got an idea.</p>
<p>"Child," she said, "the moth's struggle in the cocoon is purposeful—it gives it the strength to flap its wings and fly away from the ground, unlike its relatives who usually crawl on the ground. You didn't let it grow up, so now it can neither fly nor crawl. This is the same as children, a person as big as you, if someone solves his problems for him all the time, loses the opportunity to develop. If we use our own strength to solve every struggle in life, then this cultivates our strength to meet the next one!"</p>
<p>(4) Things That Cannot Be Taken Back</p>
<p>My younger sister, Xi Xiao Tongue, was used to spreading untruthful stories among her peers, thus causing many discords between our family and the neighbors. In fact, she didn't harbor any malicious intentions, and after being reprimanded by her family, she would say apologetically, "I'll try to take them all back."</p>
<p>Ordinary punishment was no longer effective, and my mother remembered a lesson that her grandmother had taught her. She instructed my sister to take a feather pillow core outside and cut it open. Then my mother said, "Now I want you to put all the feathers that have been poured out back inside."</p>
<p>"But that's impossible!" my sister said, "They've already flown everywhere."</p>
<p>"That's right!" my mother replied, "They are just like the rumors that you spread, once they are spread, you can no longer take them all back."</p>
<p>Now, when I am about to pass on unverified rumors or gossip to others, I immediately remember this lesson that my mother gave to my sister. (Translated from the April issue of Reader's Digest)</p>
<h3>War Criminal Okawa Shumei</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>Okawa Shumei, the director of the Manchurian Railway East Asia Economic Bureau, who was arrested as a war criminal for participating in the "September 18th" Incident, was also the former chairman of the "Shinbukai" of the Black Dragon Society, the Taisei Yokusankai, and Ashida Hitoshi. Recently, due to suffering from third-stage syphilis, combined with mental disorder, the Far East International Tribunal has decided to stop trying him and wait for him to die. This is the fourth person to be missing from the war criminals on trial. The previous three were Konoe (suicide), Matsuoka and Nagano (death in prison).</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, we can recall the farce that Okawa performed when the International Tribunal began questioning Japanese war criminals in Tokyo on May 3 last year. He first unbuttoned his shirt, gladly stroked his chest and abdomen, and then suddenly reached out and hit Tojo, who was sitting in front of him. Okawa was immediately taken out of the courtroom and sent for a physical examination. It was said that his nerves were somewhat abnormal. Now we know that he not only has mental illness, but also has severe</p>
<p>Okawa is sixty years old, a graduate of the Department of Indian Philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, and a famous Doctor of Law. However, he is a believer in fascism. The followers of those secret fascist groups all admire him. He successively organized groups such as the Yuzonsha, the Kōchisha, and the All-Japan Patriotic Common People's Learning Council. He thoroughly advocated the "Radical Mainland Theory," so he had close ties with young military officers. In 1931, he even plotted with Hashimoto Kingoro to seize power, but it was abandoned due to opposition from the military. However, he then prepared with the Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Itagaki and others to launch an incident in Shenyang. After the "Shenyang Incident" broke out, he was busy organizing the "Shinbukai," based on the so-called "Shinmu Founding Spirit," with the aim of Greater East Asianism and reforming the Japanese government. It brought together young military officers, members of the Kōchisha, and the Taisei Yokusankai; and with the financial support of industrialist Ishihara Hiroichiro as backing, it had ties with the military. Its financial strength and power were the greatest among fascist groups. At that time, he was a thorough militarist thinker, vigorously advocating aggressive ideas, and his views became the creed of militarists. In 1933, during the Japanese "May 15 Incident," he was arrested for providing funds and weapons. After being released on bail the following year, the Shinbukai was dissolved in the following year. He was sentenced to four years in prison for the criminal part, and began serving his sentence after the establishment of the Konoe Cabinet. He was released on bail. Although he later had obvious direct involvement in aggressive actions and incidents, he spared no effort in planning, advocating, and assisting, so the Far East International Military Tribunal wanted to arrest and try him for his crimes, mainly because he participated in the conspiracy of the "September 18th" Incident.</p>
<p>It is said that his learning is like a crane among chickens among lawyers, with a rare Mongolian-type face in Japan, and aristocratic manners. From his figure, he looks very much like a diplomat. Unfortunately, he went astray into the fascist camp and became a terrible and hateful person.</p>
<h3>Knowing Each Other Too Late</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Man A: I want to find my deceased wife to say a word.</p>
<p>Man B: Why?</p>
<p>Man A: I haven't finished telling her what I think of her, and she passed away.</p>
<h3>Fisherman's Song</h3>
<p>— Ning Po</p>
<p>"The perch is fat, the jug of wine is hot, a small boat rests on the river; you say dukes and marquises are happy, but I, a fisherman, have a heart as clear as water, and money as pure as snow, how can I compare to those who extract fat and blood from the people."</p>
<p>It is not known who wrote this doggerel fisherman's song. Its meaning is to clearly state the chastity of the fisherman who relies on his own efforts and the greedy officials who specialize in sucking the people's cream. However, it may have forgotten that today's fishermen who rely on fishing for a living in lakes and seas are probably unable to find one out of ten who has the blessing of fat fish and hot wine!</p>

<h3>No Ivory</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Girl A: What did your boyfriend say after you crashed the car?</p>
<p>Girl B: Shall I omit the swear words he used and not tell you?</p>
<p>Girl A: Of course.</p>
<p>Girl B: He didn't say a word.</p>
<h3>Invisible Garbage</h3>
<p>— A Lin</p>
<p>Someone sarcastically said: Shanghai is a city that produces garbage. Perhaps under the current declining economic situation, garbage is truly the city's biggest product. Because other industries may stagnate or close down, while garbage is universally produced by four million citizens, with no wage issues and no unemployment phenomenon for three million people.</p>
<p>In the past, the French used to transport garbage to fill up the Yangjingbang, but today, because there is no more bang to fill, it can only be piled up in streets and alleys. Even if some of it is shipped by boat with great difficulty, it is said that it is also sunk in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River. Therefore, the Huangpu Bureau is even busier.</p>
<p>These few days I heard that the authorities have decided to spend 400 million yuan to compete with the 4 million pounds of daily produce. This is certainly a great way to make Shanghai radiant again. It's just that visible garbage can still be removed, but invisible garbage is even more worthy of attention.</p>
<p>This invisible garbage is constantly piled up in the places that have the least garbage, but it is more relevant to environmental sanitation than visible garbage. It not only corrupts people's hearts, but also brings hunger to the door. If you don't feel anything, then please understand the four neon characters on the roof of the International Hotel. You can find that this invisible garbage has already submerged Shanghai like volcanic lava destroying ancient city-states.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to save a livelihood, morality, and people's hearts from being submerged, it is necessary to remove invisible garbage at the same time as removing visible garbage.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Director Xiong, young and vigorous, suddenly raised his eyebrows and rushed to the driver's seat in one stride. He first snatched the weapon from the woman's hand, and then with a force, he threw a Zhou wife, as fat as a pig, straight from the car to the ground. Her pair of square-toed black leather shoes also seemed to have grown wings and flew up from their owner's feet, straight into the air.</p>
<p>"Bastard! See if you're still fierce, you shrew?" Director Xiong said proudly, raising his hands and sticking out his chest.</p>
<p>The woman rolled around on the ground readily, crying and cursing all the way, flattening a large patch of green grass like she was practicing "Drunken Eight Immortals."</p>
<p>"Director Hou, Mrs. Hou, please get in the car!" Company Commander Liu also seized this opportunity and rushed over to throw down all the fat woman's scattered luggage, and hurriedly greeted the middle-aged man to get in the car.</p>
<p>However, their movements were not fast enough. The fat woman on the ground had stopped rolling and suddenly jumped up and pounced like a madman; at this time, her face was covered with mud, plus tears and snot, making her look like a clay god enshrined in a rural temple. Director Xiong saw that her momentum was too fierce and did not have time to take care of his identity, so he rushed up to block her head-on.</p>
<p>"I'm going to fight you!" But the woman was not afraid of him at all, but took advantage of the situation to twist him firmly, and the two of them looked like they were practicing wrestling.</p>
<p>Young Director Xiong was really embarrassed this time, and he almost wanted to draw his gun, but he finally managed to restrain himself; after a minute or two, the mud on the fat woman's face and body had all been wiped onto his grass-green military uniform, and then his cap was also torn off. Seeing this scene, many people cheered like Zhang Chang.</p>
