<h3>改組政府尙待洽商　靑年民社兩黨在滬會談　和談新案業已轉交中共</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕雷震廿四日下午三時五十分乘車離京赴滬。據聞係為改組政府問題與在滬各黨派有所洽商，因民社·靑年兩黨之參加改組政府，原則早經決定，只在參加方式如何</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃晤左舜生氏，詢以對於改組政府接洽後之感想，承答覆三點如下：</p>
<p>（一）各方認改組政府，須國民黨首先能改變二十年來一黨之作風，無論中央與地方，必須澈上澈下，一改從來習慣，否則國民然外之人士，對於參加政府，終不免顧慮多端。</p>
<p>（二）憲法第二章關於人民之自由權利，必須提早實施，否則對於言論出版集會結社之自由，尙不能合法保障，對於改組前途自不免多所障碍。</p>
<p>（三）目前一切經濟財政措施，實使人民時時感到生活上之惶恐，必有一種適當之緊急處置，使局勢漸趨安定，然後始能從容計議其他。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨在滬九常委昨晚在左宅舉行談話會，就在京接洽事項交換意見。又該黨留京之五常委，聞不日亦可返滬。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨中常委多數離滬度歲，致昨日該黨總部依然　無一人，各方矚目之該黨中常會議，何日召開，尙未決定，徐傳霖氏以在滬在京與各方商談後，身心頗感疲憊，於十一日赴杭休息，定週後返滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕首都舊年在雨雪紛霏中渡過和談，因共黨表示拒絕，亦若黯淡之天時，陷入拖延狀態。在京之民社·靑年兩黨人士，大多於舊曆除夕赴滬，剩下張東蓀，曾一度晋　主席，並應司使與蘇大使召　，張於二十三夜車離京赴滬，行前曾與雷震長談，傳與改組政府有關。政府所發聲明及和談新方案，二十二日由美使館傅涇波轉致共黨辦事處，共黨方面二十四日表示，共黨對此事可以解放日報二十一日之社評作答，該文仍一本過去作風詆政府此舉為「新的騙局」。未段謂；「最後表示中共和中國人民，堅決和急迫地要求眞正的和平與眞正的民主，吾們憑着自己的慘痛經騐，決計不再上當，「定要揭穿蔣的新騙局」，並以自己的努力，爭取上述兩項最低要求的實現，奠定眞正和平民主的基礎，不達目的不止。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟秘書長張東蓀暨宣傳委會副主任葉　義兩氏，十九日應美大使司徒氏之邀赴京，勾留四日，業於昨（二十四日）晟乘車返滬，記者昨日趨訪，適張氏因　途勞頓，酣睡未醒，由葉駕義氏接談。據稱：渠等在京，曾與司徒大使長談兩次，主要係關於燕大校事，對時局意見，亦曾陳述，惟司徒大使並無表示。廿一日午張氏曾應蔣主席邀宴，在座者尙有蔣夫人及張羣，雷震兩氏，張東蓀先生赴京時，携有民盟二中全會宣言等文件，原擬面呈蔣主席，不意在滬站被竊，故宴時張氏即將宣言內容扼要報吿，並强調希望早日停止內戰，恢復和談，蔣主席深表同意，至改組政府一事，並未談及。記者詢以恢復和談已瀕絕望，民盟是否仍擬居間調解，渠答稱：民盟現已無能為力。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕記者今晚訪邵力子，詢以改組政府問題，邵氏表示毫無意見，僅稱：甚盼各報特別注意國際方面動態。</p>
<h3>英不干涉中國內政　决履行莫斯科宣言支持國民政府　英掌璽大臣於上議院宣布</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕英上議院今日舉行中國局勢之辯論。</p>
<p>〔又電〕掌　大臣喬維特勳爵，在上議院代表政府答工黨議員林賽主張由英，美，蘇共商中國局勢之議稱：英國在莫斯科宣言中，已允諾決不干涉中國之內部事件，今後當繼續嚴格遵守此一諾言。中國事乃中國人之事，英國僅希望中國內部能迅速言歸於好，英國茍能爲助，當盡力促成之。在莫斯科宣言中，承認中國有統一及民主政府之需要，英國繼續承認將介石領導之國民政府爲中國之合法政府，英國並將繼續支持該一政府完成統一與民主，此乃吾人一貫的政策。</p>
<p>英國決不盲從任何外國政策</p>
<p>但渠又曰：若中國欲成眞正民主，必須不受一黨之極權統治，故英國深爲歡迎履行莫斯科宣言，關於該部之規定，使政府基礎擴大，容納民主份子。渠繼謂：渠同意馬歇爾將軍不滿國共兩黨間互相猜疑心理之表示，希望雙方以及各黨之善意份子聯合一致，盡力爲國家之幸福而工作。喬維特並即否認英國之支持美國對華政策爲鼓勵中國之內戰，聲明英政府決不盲從任何外國之政策。英國在華之目標正與美國相同，目的乃在通商，並與廣大民主基礎之政府，保持堅强關係。除此以外，英國並無其他志願。喬維特復否認英國以軍火供給中國，並曰：據渠所知，美國亦已敷月未以軍火供給中國。</p>
<p>希望中國統一盼美繼續調處</p>
<p>渠繼對中國開始設立憲政政府表示歡迎，但共黨竟拒絕參加，實爲不幸之至。希望中共爲國家利益計，勿再拒絕此一參加民主政府之最後機會，使和平與統一得以實現，更　其他黨派能促成共黨之加入，並盼美國能繼續調處。英國對美國及中國國民政府，將盡力給予道義上的支援。喬維特繼述及英國在華之地位，表示希望英國財產能儘速發還，英政府當鼓勵英商恢復其在華之地位，並以中國所需之物供給中國。中英商約華方反建議，已由英政府在研究中。渠認最重要之點，即爲准許英船得自由在長江各口靠岸。喬氏最後聲稱：根據撤廢英國在華治外法權之中英兩國協定，中國政府應接受結束前公共租界之一切正式責任，英政府認爲此項責任當包括給予前工部局英籍職員以公允之解職金一項在內。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕按林賽爵士爲米契爾林賽之父，米契爾在中共區域居留甚久，去年返英，其夫人爲中國夏女士，夫婦在華育有子女兩人，將來承繼爵位後，夫人即爲爵夫人，中國女子得此榮將，將以夏女士爲第一人。</p>
<h3>本年軍費縮减　政府實行裁軍</h3>
<p>各軍將裁減百分之廿</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕爲配合建軍建國計劃，又以本年度軍費縮減，政府當局決實行裁軍。據悉　裁軍計劃刻正擬議中，聞各部隊及軍事機關以各軍為單位，全體官兵將裁減百分之二十。</p>
<h3>綏靖區政委會　開會檢討工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕綏靖區政委會成立三月，爲檢討工作起見，廿四日召開會議，由白崇禧主席，出席兪大維，張厲生等，分由內政部，經濟部，社會部，糧食部，衛生署，地政署，行總，財政部，交通部，四聯總處，農民銀行，合作金庫各單位報吿，並提出總報吿，據該會副秘長陳克文吿記者，該會所轄範圍爲蘇·皖·魯·豫·冀·熱·察·綏·晋九省共三百餘縣，其中經收復者爲一百八十餘縣。三個月來共發出急賑款七十二萬四千萬元，物資麵粉二萬噸（即九十二萬袋），衣服五萬包（一百五十萬套），鹽五十萬斤。又各省所撥發復員補助費，總數至一月廿二日止，共發　　八十一億二千萬，收復各縣均免收田賦，收復後各縣並撥給補助費，分五等發給，頭等每縣三千八百萬，二等三千二百萬，三等二千五百萬，共二百億，此次尙未全部發出。又關於醫藥衛生計撥五億元，組織醫藥防療隊，分赴各地工作，其餘爲補助農村小本貸款，由農行代辦，共發一百廿億，合作金庫經發四十億，江蘇現僅餘一縣未收復，各項工商貸款請求之總數爲五百億，政府已交四聯總處辦理，由六行局按實際情形，放款凡在五千萬以下者，由各行局自行辦理，手續簡單。</p>
<h3>國大秘書處　決展緩結束</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日置〕國大秘書處前經決定一月十五日結束，茲以交待迄未完竣，洪蘭友對記者談，結束工作尙極紛繁，而交通工具之影響，尙有八十餘代表未離京，現已集中住於第三招待所。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國大新疆代表哈德曼·喬嘉甫等，廿四日九時許自京乘空運隊專機飛返迪化。</p>
<h3>五年經濟計劃　主席已予批准</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕國府文官長吳　昌今日單獨接見聯合社記者稱：中國五年經濟計劃甫經蔣主席批准，交由行政院執行，所　經費，按法幣三元合美金一元之戰前價値計算，共二千二百億元，其中三分之一由國庫支出，三分之一由外人投資，三分之一則來自人民。此方案係由經騐豐富之各種專家於一九四四年起草，至翌年方始完成。去年初提交最高經濟委員會通過，方案分下列數部：（一）交通，（二）工業，（三）礦務，（四）電力生產，（五）水利，（六）農業。</p>
<h3>雷啓霖已保釋</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕國大代表雷啓霖，首都高等法院檢察處，以寗夏高等法庭未能如限繳送雷氏全案證件，乃於本月廿日上午九時提訊雷氏，當庭着交保釋放，聽候核辦，雷氏乃於當日正午出獄。</p>
<h3>熊式輝飛抵南昌</h3>
<p>將返安義故里掃墓</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿四日電〕東北行轅主任熊式輝，今携眷由京乘天雄號專機返贛，於上午十一時半抵此。同機來贛者有國大代表王枕心，李後釗，賴偉英，王菁華，參政員吳建陶等。據熊氏語記者，東北情况甚佳，至共產黨問題決用政治方式解決。記者詢以報載即將接長國防部事，氏笑謂，此乃報紙新聞耳。熊氏在贛約作一週勾留，即行晋京，並定廿七日返安義故里掃墓。</p>
<h3>美對華貸款</h3>
<p>馬帥將促請重行準備</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕進出口銀行發言人今日宣稱：中國如欲獲得美國已指定之五萬萬美元借款，必須於五個月內整頓其經濟。換言之，中國政府必須於六月三十日提出詳細計劃書，說明如何運用此項借款。美國方面早已於十個月前指定五萬萬美元作爲中國復興借款，此款如在本年六月三十日尙未放出，則須自動作廢。馬歇爾曾於去年在駐華特使任內促請進出口銀行儲款以待，俾能誘導中國停止內戰。惟今年六月三十日即使爲此項貸款放出期限，過期後亦並非即謂中國永不能向美舉債，新任國務卿馬歇爾可能請進出口銀行考慮，另作貸款準備。</p>
<h3>美名作家籲請接濟中國作家</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三日合衆電〕美名作家多人聯名致函「民族」雜誌編輯，籲請接濟中國作家，謂中國作家經濟確實窘迫，作品復無銷路，出版家亦多因經濟原因而遭封閉，業務至爲艱難，作家多改任敎師，然因通貨膨脹，所得薪金終不定養家。</p>
<h3>皮爾遜汚辱沈崇案　被判强姦已遂罪　沈父稱其女本學期將輟讀</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕美兵暴行案公審，廿日問完了，雙方所提出的中美證人，此間雖有新證人發現，但沒有引起庭上的注意。廿一日開了辯論庭，檢查官宣佈了皮爾遜罪行的要證後，被吿的辯護人雖也說出了似是而非的「合奸」辯論，但經過檢察官的一度反駁，也便完了案。廿二日便宣佈了皮爾遜的「强姦」罪的成立，此案從十七日起到廿二日止，共進行了五天，一切都按照預定計劃進行，各方反響大致都好，認爲美軍當局處理此事件的態度，相當開明。今所注意的，只看判刑了。此處應注意的，是檢察官也承認了皮爾遜是醉後强姦。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿二日電〕美駐華海軍陸戰隊增援第一師軍事法庭審判長休士中校宣布，美軍伍長皮爾遜暴行案，應爲强姦已遂罪。法庭係於廿二日晨十時開始，出席旁聽者爲胡適，左明徹，紀元以及中外記者等十七人，首由檢察官助理楊格中校宣讀第四日寨詢紀錄，旋由檢察官宣布，昨夜請示師長霍華德將軍，起訴書中第三及第五兩罪，是否應予不考慮，據復電上兩罪應撤銷，此時庭長爲之一震，被吿皮爾遜能度變爲驚惶。又法官僅五分鐘之討論，由審判長休士中校宣布起訴書之第二與第四兩罪不成立，皮爾遜應判爲第一項强姦已遂罪，宣布即令解被吿回押，時爲十時三十分，檢察官繼宣布本案結束。至應處何刑，尙俟呈轉華盛頓海軍部長核定後宣布此時旁聽人紀元，左明徹胡適等互相握手，對本案勝訴，至表欣慰。至美國道歉一節，將俟判決核定宣布後，即可舉行，賠償事尙待受害人家屬呈請另案辦理。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿三日電〕北大校長胡適，於廿三日晨美兵皮爾遜暴行被判爲强姦已遂罪後，對記者談稱：本人於本月六日對各位（本外埠新聞界）表示，即有信心，相信美軍法庭可有公正判決，至此皮被判强姦已遂罪，以證明本人之信心，此案判決極爲公正。又息，另一美兵帮兇案，可能於下星期三（本月廿九日）另組法庭公審，此法庭較簡單。又沈崇之父沈劭稱：廿四日飛京，沈小姐略遲三數日亦返京，本期學業勢必輟讀。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕據關係方面息，沈崇女士之父沈劭，此次來平參加公審犯罪美兵，係搭乘美軍第三三二航空隊飛機來平，茲以該美兵强姦罪已成立，此案即暫吿一段落，聞沈氏即南返，美軍當局並已爲備妥機位。</p>
<p>〔本報桂林廿一日電〕此間各大中學生，對平美軍强姦女生案提抗議。</p>
<h3>法軍再度登陸西沙島　我進行直接交涉　法大使將赴越調查實况</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕關於西沙事件，當前局勢略有變化，在廿三日以前，法方猶坦白承認法軍之在該羣島中巴德爾島登陸，並非奉巴黎命令。不致影響談判，使問題得以解決，梅理靄大使並表示，將赴越一行，藉以明瞭實况。但廿三日法軍續在該羣島中另一島登陸後，法方態度已有更改，有提議將此問題交於國際仲裁企圖，惟我方立塲依舊，如數次聲明所云：決依條約及其他有關外交文件，進行直接交涉，確保國家主權。不久前自美返國之巨型補給艦「嗎味」峨工號，已奉命載運兵械糧秣啓碇，駛往支援駐防該羣島之少數國軍之加强衛戌，以免彼等未奉法國政府命令，恣意非爲擅自行動之法軍，造成更多不利於和諧談判之任何局勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿四日電〕據權威方面消息稱：法駐華大使梅里靄，將於十日內赴越南，調查法軍在西沙羣島登陸事。據法大使館消息稱：此次法軍登陸西沙羣島之事，並非出於法政府之命令，諒係駐越南法軍。華方對此事向法政府提出抗議後，法方已呈軟化，法大使之往越南調查此事，乃防止以後此事之擴大。</p>

<h3>魯南共軍攻陷棗莊　續窺臨城已遭堅强阻擊　台兒莊仍在國軍固守中</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州廿四日電〕共軍此次在魯南糾合逾十萬之衆，沿台棗支綫發動大規模攻勢，企圖擴大內亂，威脅徐州，本月五日復舉其全力對攻華中產量最大之棗莊煤礦，國軍第五十一師周毓英師長奉兩個師奉命堅守，期為國家保存一分元氣，乃冒雨雪交加之縣烈天氣，與卅餘倍來犯之共軍博門，共軍雖曾數次突入陣地，但均被奮力擊退。共軍因傷亡近三萬，於十九日集結其所有兵力，更番向棗莊作殊死之猛攻，並以重砲十餘門，小砲數十門轟擊，守軍英勇抗拒，反復衝鋒，殺聲震天地，血肉橫飛，至廿四下午，此軍民合作浴血苦戰堅守達十五晝夜之棗莊煤礦，終以衆寡懸殊，工事盡毀，彈盡力竭而被共軍攻陷，周師長忠黨　國，已盡其最大之努力，亦壯烈成仁。共軍日來復沿臨　支　兩側西犯，圖窺臨城，國軍某有力部隊正堅强阻擊中。又台兒莊仍由國軍固守，屹然無恙。國軍控制　海東段後，速日進行肅淸工作，刻蘇北隴海路南已無大股共軍　擾。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京二十四日電〕延安電台今日廣播稱：中共陳毅所部　國軍第五十一師激戰後，已於本月二十日佔領魯南要城棗莊，國軍死傷一萬一千人。國防部頃承認棗莊失守，惟該部發言人稱：中共所傳國軍之傷亡人數，實路「荒謬」，棗莊距離國軍防綫過遠，僅由少數軍隊防守，故予放棄。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州廿四日電〕共軍兩千餘人，廿日由　　附近竄至睢寗北十餘里之魏集一帶，當被駐軍逐退，至廿二日睢寗境內已無共軍蹤踪。</p>

<p>〔本報潘陽廿三日電〕吉長綫外圍共軍受挫後，永吉長春一帶所受威脅已完全减除，吉長中長兩路直達瀋腸客車，廿一日已抵瀋，長吉人心頗鎭定。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿三日電〕據關係方面息：此次長春軍調部共方電台被地方軍事當局查封，係因共方利用無綫電台，與東北共軍密通消息，便利共軍發動攻勢，地方軍事當局自衛計，不得不採取此種措置（共方電台現已發還，消息見廿一日本報。）按軍調部執行小組政府方面電台，前亦曾數度被共方查封，計張家口第五小組政府方面電台，於卅五年九月十八日下午六時卅分，會被共方代表率兵沒收，雖經抗議，結果無效。又集寗第一執行小組，政府方面電台，於卅五年九月四日下午十時卅分，曾因共方藉口當時軍事情况，被共方沒收，禁止通報。</p>
<h3>長春重見光明</h3>

<h3>保定外圍共軍蠢動　萬餘人猛犯定縣正混戰中</h3>
<p>〔本報保定廿四日電〕舊歷除夕夜八時起，保定外圍共軍同時發動進犯各綫國軍防地，徐水南史各莊。田莊·漕河各車站發生激烈砲戰，城南北大冉，城東石橋，黃垞各據點，均有戰事，城北居民可聞，淸晰槍砲聲，情形一度緊張，晚十二時後，共軍後退，各綫戰事暫息，保垣人民除夕飽受一塲虛驚。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿三日電〕徐永北七林堡，田村堡，及徐水西東西藏村，荊唐舖，史各莊等地，廿一日晚六時，突有共軍數千名，分向各該地國軍據點進犯，激戰四小時，共軍不支，向西北退去。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿四日電〕共軍萬餘，連日向定縣猛犯，現仍混戰中。</p>
<p>國軍撤出望都團長不幸被俘</p>
<p>〔本報保定廿四日電〕自十九日起，共軍挾三旅之衆，圍攻望都。該地國軍近日曾增加一團，然亦衆寡不敵，雙方激戰，至廿二日晚十時，當地駐軍七百餘，由團長趙和珍率領，自動撤出縣城，秩序良好，北行至方順橋附近，共軍冒用保定方面國軍番號，刦往西方，行至于家莊南郎家莊時，國軍發覺，旋又發生激戰，團長趙和珍及兵士三百餘被虜走，其餘官兵及行政人員及難民等共三百五十人逃來保定（現均住城西南十里之四平莊）。保急賑中隊廿一日起發放糧款，暫予救濟。</p>
<p>貫通保石鐵路國軍俱有把握</p>
<p>〔本報保定廿四日電〕保定情勢緊張聲中，記表於廿二日分訪各關係方面，據稱：保定外　共軍近積極活動，企圖進犯省垣，再度破壞平漢路交通，深具有宣傳性，以現時情形言，保垣國軍實力雄厚，且多爲機械化之優秀部隊，盤據於城垣十五里外之共軍，雖達六萬餘人，惟其裝備積良而具有戰鬥力之部隊不及三分之一，在戰鬥方面，國軍佔絕對優勢。遷來保定西方集結之共軍，頻頻調遣，企圖蠢動，用意不過在相機滋擾或虛張聲勢。再國軍防綫綿長，實不能崗哨接連，共軍則擊虛避實，致發生小據點之爭奪，局部戰事以及交通事故等，實所難免，共軍若欲再造成上年平漢路北段情勢，目前殊不可能。至保石段之貫通，國軍有絕對把握，惟保定方面刻正全力防衛冀西共軍活動，該段貫通僅時間問題。</p>

<h3>薛篤弼再復董必武　述堵口工程眞相</h3>
<p>洒淚陳詞為黃淮流域民衆請命</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕關於黃河堵口復堤工程事，中共一再阻礙，水利委員會委員長薛篤弼於一月十五日接中共代表董必武函詢各節後，特再函復　氏，將事實眞象，詳爲答復如下：</p>
<p>（一）本會與貴方代表僅有卅五年五月十八日之一次談話，蓋因貴方與黃河水利委員會商談而又有異議，故派代表趙明甫君等來京，與本會直接協商者也。該次談話會紀錄，應認爲雙方之基本協議，凡關於黃河堵口復堤工程之進行，自當悉以該項協議爲依據，至來函所謂歷次會議紀錄和協議，本會旣未參加，自不受其拘束。</p>
<p>共區堤工延誤不能歸咎中央</p>
<p>（二）　上年五月十八日談話會紀錄關於復堤工程，經商定「下游急要復堤工程，包括險工及局部整理河樑，儘先完成，同時規劃全部工程　接推進」，（原紀錄一　一項），「急要工程所需工款，由水利委員會充分籌撥」，（原紀錄一款三項），「此項復堤工作，爭取於六月五日以前開工」，（原紀錄一款四項），「施工事項在中共區域以內地段，由中共辦理），（原紀錄一款五項），對於工程性質完成步驟及辦理權責，均已有明確之商定，所有貴方區域內急要工程所需工款，本會已於上年六七兩月先後分三次領轉行總轉交貴方，旋經塔德顧問赴貴方區域實地調查，認爲本會所撥之款，連同行總所撥之糧，已足敷貴方所做工程之用，可見中央已盡到原紀錄一款三項充分籌撥急要工程所需工款之責任，乃來函一則謂政府尙欠四十九億元未付，再則謂整理險工之款毫無着落，顯與事實不符。至來函所謂（整理險工全未開始，七月以來下游復堤工程全部停頓）云云，查下　復堤工程在　由河北修防處負責辦理，截至上年十二月十日，據報已成土方（五二六八九九）公方，在魯由山東修防處負責辦理，截至上年十二月底，據　已完成土方（八六六·〇七二）公方，至中共區則由貴方負責辦理，據塔德顧問視察報吿，已完成土方（一〇·六二〇·〇〇〇）公方，是雙方對於下游復堤工作，均早已積極進行，且貴方早已得到上述款糧，中共區內之堤工如有延誤，其責應由貴方負之，固不能歸咎於中央也。</p>
<p>下游如不堵合必然造成慘象</p>
<p>（三）上年五月十八日談話會紀錄內載；（關於下游河道以內居民遷移救濟問題黃委會已呈請有案，請中央從速指定辦理，俾能配合堵口復堤工程之需要）云云，按中央轄區豫冀境內黃河故道內居民三萬餘人，因聞黃河將歸故道，均已自動搬移，並未要求救濟。至貴方魯境河道內究有居民若干，中央無法查悉，而貴方　次提出數字，前後各不相符，所要求之遷移數目，，忽而一五〇億，忽而三〇四億，更使中央莫知究竟，欲從事調查，則又無從着手，故不能不愼重考慮，好在此款已由政府全數撥交行總，現已不成問題矣。</p>
<p>（四）上年五月十八日談話會紀錄，關於堵口工程商定（繼續進行，以不使下游發生水害爲原則，）本會不特並未忽視，且早已十分注意，故在大汛時期，決持愼重態度，並不敢積極趕進，而在目前枯水期間，則必須加緊施工，以期把　時期，正所以使水徐徐流入故道，俾沿河地方官民可視水流情勢從事培修堤岸工作，以免下游之災害。歷來修堤之工作，均在此時進行，今大函則謂（政府不管下游堤工，不顧下游河道居民之生命財產，只是限期堵口），殊與事實適成相反，如果照貴方主張延期五個月堵口，正是大汎屆臨之時，如於該時堵口不惟，在枝術上發生重大困難，不易合龍，即令可以堵合，而洪水東下，一瀉千里，下游必造成不可想象之水災。誠如來函所云將爲（世界罕見罕聞之慘事），中央對全國同胞一視同仁，毫不能勉循貴方之意，忍於出此下策也</p>
<p>所謂先期放水實係共方托詞</p>
<p>（五）來函又以（在堵口之前，已先期放水，又不通知貴方）相責，關於此點，請先就堵口方式略加說明，則自可獲得合理之解答，此次堵口係採用平堵法，即先用木樑建一便橋，將決口之兩端連接，由橋上拋塡石塊，使積成一石壩，以阻遏水流，俾水位逐漸抬高，一方並就水流與故道間淤高之處挖溝若干道，使水位抬高至相當程度時，河水即逐漸由此溝引入舊道，故謂之引河，此爲施工前預定計劃。上年五月十八日談話會紀錄中，貴方代表所提保留意見，亦僅云大汎前不挖引河，可見此項施工步驟原屬極爲明瞭，上月二十七日引河過水，即係因水位抬高，滲入所致，此乃拋石堵口之自然結果，又何得謂爲（先期放永）。况花園口工地自始即有貴方代表常用駐工聯繫，對於工程進度，當必完全明瞭，亦必隨時報吿貴方，證以貴方晋，冀，魯，豫邊區政府冀，魯，豫行署上年十一月十一日黃字第二號布吿，嘵諭人民，以水將回歸故道，飭速搬出河床此尙遠在上年十二月廿七日，引河漫水之前四十七天，尤足見貴方對於拋石堵口之自然結果，早已知之，且早已備之，於此而諉爲不知，其誰信之。若謂本月二三兩日京滬各報載有開封·菏澤·濟南凡政府軍駐地，均早有準備，以之與貴方相較，恐準備尙不及貴方之早也。</p>
<p>盼望惻隱為懷以免功虧一簣</p>
<p>（六）至謂本會「不願停止堵口工程，不願停止放水，籍口救護新汛區，實際淹沒舊河區域，勢必發生嚴重後果」，此種嚴重後果之能否發生，全視貴方修復下游堤防情形以爲斷。觀乎上述貴方冀·魯·豫行署布吿，早已在搶修堤防及遷移居民，計時當已吿竣，即使尙未完工現時正可趕進若干，故遲遲不修，是坐視下游七百餘萬人民之災害而不爲預防，其責自應由貴方負之。再以技術立塲而言，堵口工程，在此時實有萬不可緩者，蓋堵口石壩係用亂石拋成，目前水位已經抬高，石壩所承受之水壓力甚大，水流上衝下刷，均足以摧毀整個壩身工程，不進則退，一旦停止進行，勢將全功盡棄。又石壩設計係利用冬季低水流量而施工，現正爲搶堵最緊要之關頭，就現在口門之寬度言，如陝州流量超過一千五百秒公方，即可發生極大危險，且凌汛即屆，一旦冰塊順流而下，便橋與石壩有同歸於盡之處。即凌汛倖能渡過，三月後桃汛時期，危險更大，已成工程，必遭衝毀，故拋石工作，必須繼續進行。至封口斷流，則不妨稍緩，此中情形，昨在滬業經詳談，此應請貴方諒察者也。</p>
<p>抑猶有言者，本會爲事業機構，只知爲永利建設努力，極願竭其款款之誠，得到各方之共同合作，使此有關民生國計之水利事業，得以順利進行，以期無負於國家，無愧於人民。我豫·蘇·皖諸省同胞，在八年抗戰之中，已飽受日寇之蹂躪，洪水之災害，今者，勝利已逾一年，而哀此衆庶，尙在水深火熱之中，矜憫之心，人所同具，縱有政見之不同，亦何忍使此功虧一簣之黃河堵復工程敗於垂成，以辛苦戰後之　黎耶，謹以一顆赤心，洒涙陳詞，爲黃淮流械父老民衆竭誠請命，所望惻隱爲懷，對此垂成之功，予以援手，無任感禱之至。</p>

<h3>我駐巨港領事抵吧城　宣布印尼軍暴行　僑胞死傷千餘人屍體亦被肢解</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿二日電〕我駐巨港領事陳元屏，今午後乘機抵此，並定今晚與我駐巴城總領事蔣家棟，往訪印尼總理沙利。陳氏並將以印尼暴行下被肢解之僑胞屍體照片，及在荷軍砲火及印尼縱火焚燒下，所焚毀之僑胞房屋照片，供沙利觀看。渠於記者訪問時稱：按本月十七日以前接獲之報吿及觀察，作最審愼之估計，我僑胞在巨港一地，被擊斃者達二五〇人，受輕重傷者達千人，失蹤者六百餘人，刻登記要求中國社團救濟者爲六千人，此項數字，尙非最後統計，蓋刻發現竟有若干我僑胞，舉家遭印尼份子所綁架及暗殺。關於僑胞財產損失方面，陳氏之估計數字，爲叻幣五百萬元，渠認爲荷蘭印尼雙方，對此項損失，俱應負責。渠稱：巨港城中，並未發生巷戰，荷軍係於該城附近，以大砲飛機協助砲艇轟炸下，而造成此不必要之騷擾，武裝之印尼部隊，則利用此種混亂情形，於退往距城廿公里處之前，大肆燒殺擄掠。據悉：荷軍僅在戰端發生之前，死執有手溜彈之兵士一人，另有一兵士，於醫院中殞命，而據稱：蘇門答臘印尼當局方面亦曾宣布印尼方面共死五人，故荷印雙方於戰爭中，僅共死七人。陳領事稱：巨港糧食奇缺，自星島遺往之救濟船隻刻尙未抵該地，荷蘭當局僅予受傷者以少最之藥品，我僑胞及印尼當局，刻在設法拯救遭印尼部隊所綁架之僑胞，已組織中印救援隊四隊，其中一隊，已於廿日赴鄉間工作，其他各隊亦即將開始工作。</p>

<h3>社論　美國應採取兩黨一致的對華政策</h3>
<p>美國新任國務卿馬歇爾元帥於廿一日晨返抵華府後，即至白宮宣誓就任美國第四十八任國務卿之職，儀式簡單隆重，禮成後即至國務院視事，着手於前任國務卿貝爾納斯所擬爭取世界和平未竟的工作；從此美國的外交史，又將展開嶄新的一頁了。馬歇爾國務卿以返抵華府時，曾發表一簡短談話：「余就任國務卿之職，並無政洽色彩；余並將以此自制，此時此地，實爲杜絕關於余未來政治活動任何揣測之最佳機會，余絕不捲入政治漩渦，亦不能爲人認爲任何政治職務之候選人」。馬帥的談話，仍不失軍人的本色，美國國務卿一職，由將帥担任。實以馬帥爲嚆矢，而由軍人處理外交的最大特色，厥爲超出黨派之外，推行舉國一致的外交政策，在目前的美國尤其需要超脫黨派的國務卿，採取共和與民主兩黨共同的外交政策。</p>
<p>前任國務卿貝爾納斯任內所採取的外交政策，曾獲得民主與共和兩黨的一致擁護，自可以目爲民主與共和兩黨共同一致的外交政策，當貝爾納斯與華萊士對於外交政策發牛爭議時，雖曾引起政界的軒然大波，但貝氏因能獲得兩黨共同一致的擁護，故其在國內的地位及聲譽，屹然不動，反而華萊士不得不辭去商務部長，退出杜魯門政府。惟吾人檢討貝氏所採取的外交政策，其對於歐洲方面，兩黨的意見完全一致，但對於遠東方面，尤其是對華政策，民主與共和兩黨在原則雖無重大出入，但是也有着相當的距離，此一距離，在今日的美國政府，亟待設法消滅，馬帥之由駐華特使昇任國務卿，其唯一的任務，也就在綜合民主與共和兩黨的意見，鑄成美國兩黨共同一致的遠東政策。所以馬帥在就職後與杜魯門總統第一次會晤時，就討論中國問題，可知馬帥對於中國問題的重視。</p>
<p>據政治觀察家分析目下美國國務院所面臨的若干迫切問題，計有下述五項（一）因波蘭普選問題引起美波兩國關係的惡化；（二）莫斯科四國外長會議將於三月十日舉行，應如何改善美蘇的關係；（三）解決阿根廷問題，以及整個拉丁美洲問題；（四）國務院內部人事的更迭；（五）中國問題，馬帥擬於最短期內發表談話，以闡明其在離華時所發表的聲明。這些都是亟待新任國務卿迅速解決的迫切問題，但是馬帥與杜魯門總統初次會晤時，就討論中國問題，足見馬帥與杜魯門總統，對於中國問題，却特別重視。晤談的內容，雖未經官方發表，局外人自無法探悉，但是我們閉目猜測，也可以知其梗槪。</p>
<p>目下中美兩國人民的視綫，完全集中在華府，大家看美國政府在物質上援助中國建國復興，是否還有所觀望。姑以美國以五萬萬美元貸與中國用於建國復興一事而論，美國進出口銀行在十個月之前，早已儲款以待，但馬帥在華調處國共衝突時，爲促成中國內爭和平解決起見，曾電請進出口銀行保留此項貸款，須至中國國內和平實現之後，始能貸與中國政府，以致這一筆貸款至今仍在美國進出口銀行的保險庫內。但是這種政策是非得失，確有待馬帥重行考慮的必要，參議院外交委員會主席即共和黨參議員范登堡曾於十一日發表演說，主張美國應改變對華政策，鼓勵中國共產黨以外之各黨組織聯合政府，並謂美國應對於『極英勇致力統一者予以鼓勵，而對於危害統一者予以阻制』。美國共和黨與政府對華政策的距離也就在此。馬帥就任國務卿後如欲縮短兩黨對於中國問題的距離，就應該特別重視范登堡於十一日所發表的演說。</p>
<p>要之，馬帥就任國務卿之後，對於中國問題的看法，當不能再以調人的立塲，斤斤於公正是求，而應從大處着眼，一方面要顧及客觀的現實，另一方面也要尊重共和黨的意見，擬定兩黨一致的對華政策。中國決不能因中共不肯放棄其武力割據的企圖，就將建國復興的計劃置之不顧，同樣美國也不能因中共的阻撓中國統一而停止其援華計劃。中國政府己擬就了一種五年經濟復興計劃，與蘇聯的第一次五年計劃相類似，其目的乃在替中國工業化奠定一個鞏固的基礎。美國對於這個計劃，在道義上自應予以協助，早已商有成議的五萬萬美元貸款，尤應迅速貸與中國，俾能有助於中國建國復興之早日成功。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕法政府向英美蘇三國提出備忘錄，建議廢除德國國會，恢復俾斯麥前之政體，由比較獨立之各邦組成分權之聯邦。該備忘錄雖尙未發表，但經探悉其內容約有下列諸要點：（一）德國應爲聯邦制，主要權力應屬諸各邦，而聯邦政府之職權僅以財政糧食，運輸，郵電及一部份經濟及外交事務爲限。（二）每一邦之議會，每四年得選舉代表組成聯邦會議。（三）聯邦會議每年任命聯邦總統一人，出該總統任命政府負責第一項之事務。（四）各邦政府應負責除第一項以外之事務，得自設警察，任命最高法院推事，任命駐外大使與外國舉行談判，但不得與外國合併或訂立盟約。（五）與德所訂之國際條約，須由聯邦會議三分之二多數通過。</p>

<h3>南國提要求限制奧軍隊</h3>
<p>引起奧地利反響</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教廿二日電〕南斯拉夫代表維爾芬頃在四外决會議申述南國政府對於奧地利和的之意見稱，奧地利參加戰爭之一切設備，均應加以毁滅，幷應廓淸德奧合併後之一切結果。奧地利之歷史素以奴役斯拉夫族爲其政策，上决大戰即起因於奧地利，故其責任應由奧人負之。南斯拉夫對於防止奧地利之泛日耳曼主義，最表關懷，所以應請嚴厲限制奧地利之軍隊人數，幷完全肅淸其納粹餘孽。維氏繼即述及南國深望取得卡林第亞及史蒂利亞　省之要求，聲明該兩省之居民極大部份均爲斯拉夫族，且併入南國後，可以防止奧國再度控制斯拉夫民族之命運，最後　復表示希望盟國得依民主原則，人種條件，政治需要，及道義原則，設法重建奧國。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕奧官方發言人對南斯拉夫向四强外長代表會要求不許奧國具有軍隊之議，深表驚異。該發言人指出前德國附庸國之和的中，亦均准許保留少數軍隊，奧國從未與希特勒的德國締盟，且爲德國第一個被害國，若不許其具有軍隊，實不足以維護奧國之自由與獨立。</p>
<h3>波蘭要求確認西疆擴土事實</h3>
<p>〔路透社華沙廿二日電〕波蘭代表團將於下星期一向四强外長代表會提出備忘錄，其中要點即爲依據波茨坦協定之規定，承認波蘭之四疆。關於德國之未來政治地位，波蘭認爲應依德國之民主及和平復興工作進展之情形，而與德國人民合作，在政治統一之原則下解決之。備忘錄復力言，和約起草之際，不可存報復之一原則爲基礎，使德國復興，重成念，應以建立合理及持久和平之國際集團之一員。</p>

<h3>西摩路大火達十三小時　居民議論紛紜大堪注意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月二十二日晚九時四十八分，（農歷年初一夜）陝西北路（即西摩路）武定路發生大火，共計焚燬房屋十三　，損失達二十餘億元，前後焚燒十三小時，爲本勝利以來所未有之大火，幸未傷人。</p>
<p>起火</p>
<p>者爲武定路四二五號平房內之銅匠作，起火原因聞係收音機走電，當時該作男主人未在，女主人張皇失措，竟夫加施救濟和，即匆匆逃避，致火勢一發不可收拾，西隣陝西北路六六〇弄一排市房十二幢，內有武定路市立國民中心小學一所，均爲三　樓屋，建於民元前五年，屋頂全用鉛皮及木板構築，屋頂與平頂間留有空隙甚大，且彼此穿貫，並無防火牆，當火順風向延及後，火勢即迅作如原子彈爆發時之香菌式蔓延，雖經消防隊蒞塲灌救，因火勢醞釀於夾層內，原擬以利斧將屋頂鉛皮劈開，任火穿頂，但鉛皮堅　，且重疊裝釘，結果徒勞無功，至廿三日晨三時許，全部房屋均已爲烈火包圍，狂風助虐，火星四射，紅火燭天，竟使到塲之消防人員一〇九名束手無策，至十時後火勢始漸消减，乃集中灌救，於十一時熄滅。</p>
<p>事後</p>
<p>記者赴火塲巡視，除起火之武定路四二五號全部焚燬外，東隣永勤膠廠及順康木行亦稍被殃及，損失輕微，西隣六六弄內廿九號，廿七號，廿五號，廿三號，廿一號，十七號，十五號大部焚燬，十三號，九號，七號，五號，三號，一號損害較輕，內廿三，廿一號，爲市立國民中心小學，僅門房兩側尙完好，內部校具盡付一炬。當火燒時，住宿於校中之敎員職工十餘人，除搶出少數衣褥外，餘均化爲烏有，不得不暫宿附近新聞路市立小學內，前日敎育局長顧毓琇已派員前往慰問，並致送救濟金二百萬元。</p>
<p>至廿九號住房，係本市三友實業社經理王雲甫之寓所，內設有豬鬃作塲，由其長子主持，火熄後檢點存物，發現保險篇已彼人撬開，內儲金條及五百元梳妝打扮關金券若干均不翼而飛。</p>
<p>同時</p>
<p>附近一般居民，議論紛紜，盛傳此次於救火之前，曾有索取金條，大講「斤頭」之情事，對此咸極表憤慨。在事實未獲證明之前，吾人當不能亡加判斷，然空穴來風，旣有此說，市政當局似應有澈底查究之必要。論情理，上海旣有自來水及救火車之優良消防設備，而竟不能迅予撲滅，任共延燒達十三小時之久，原因實難索解。此次之事眞相如何，姑且不談，但就人民立塲言，深望當局今後應切實注意，更望對消防行政，力加改善，毋使全市五百萬市民，對市政措施有失望之憾。</p>

<h3>民航史上空前創舉　巨機南京號飛渡太平洋　昨抵中途島即飛舊金山　沿途視察籌闢中美空綫</h3>
<p>自中美航約簽訂後，中國航空公司即積極籌備開　中美航綫，並已於前日淸晨四時，派專機一架，載該公司技術人員二十餘名自江灣機塲啓飛，試航美國，是爲我國民航機在歷史上第一架飛往美國之航機，亦爲中航公司成立十八年以來首决飛美之一架。該機爲四引擎DC4式之巨型機，機名「南京號」，國際標幟爲XPP02，於前晨四時啓飛離滬，即於當日下午一時十五分抵達關島，並於即晚八時五十六分離關島經威克島飛往中途島，中航公司昨日接電吿，該機經威克島時未降洛停留，逕飛中途島，已於昨日下午十二時四十五分到達，定今日飛往檀香山。預計於廿七日或廿八日可抵舊金山。並預定於下月七日或八日飛回上海。該機此行，並載有一部份郵件。據該公司負責人吳君語記者，此次南京號飛美之任務，爲調査中美航綫經過各地之塲站，及氣象，修理等設備，以作我國民航機開航中美綫之準備。吳氏又稱，吾國民航機現正逐步向外發展。去年八月廿六日，中航公司之航機一架，首决越海飛往馬尼刺。同年九月廿八日飛東京，爲我民航機歷史上飛日本之第一架。本年一月廿三日，乃又有此創歷史之第一架民航機飛往美國。俟此機返國後，中美航綫亦即將正式開闢。</p>
<h3>芷江輪獲救船客　總計達千人以上</h3>
<p>前在吳淞口外失事沉沒之芷江輪，其經過情形，已誌前報。關於該船獲救之乘客及船員之凖確數目，據江海關港口警察署吳淞分署報吿，由該署救起者計有七百七十三名，由中國海軍軍艦救起者計有四十六名，均經帶回上海。另有出口猪船六艘所救起之百餘人，則已隨該帆船出口。據港口警察署稱：該輪失事後，幸施救尙早，故其死傷人數，並下如外傳之多。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕芷江輪船在吳淞口沉沒時，中權軍艦適在該處演習，聞訊即派汽艇馳援，當經救出多人，除多數自願乘車赴滬不及登記姓名外，餘六十人及少數行李，由該艦官兵協助搬登該艦，幷給衣食，開入高昌廟後，自行上岸。</p>
<h3>閘北警局同人　節食捐助難胞</h3>
<p>本市閘北警察分局應局長志春，平時對本市難胞，關懷殊甚，最近本市冬令會舉辦庇寒所，特發動全體員警節食，計得食米二十担，曁經濟部中國植物油料廠贈送該局警之豆油三總，悉數　送庇寒所，充難胞福食，熱心殊填欽佩。</p>
<h3>防癆封票運動　希望繼續義購</h3>
<p>上海防癆協會爲彌補該會所辦兩醫院經費之不足，曾於去年十二月起，發動防癆封票發售運動，據該會總幹事黃嘉歷稱二該項運動，經本埠中外大小各學校機關社銀行商行之響應義購，截至目前爲止，所收捐款已達國幣五百餘萬元，惟去該會原定之一千萬元目標尙遠，希望本埠各界繼續踴躍義買。茲聞該會今年防癆封票之圖案，已決定採用該會已故前名譽秘書兼院長美人海深德醫師之遺像，緣海醫師致力上海防癆工作，筆路藍縷，鞠躬盡瘁，該會特予以此項榮譽，以表彰其勳續。</p>
<h3>美教會贈我乳牛　七百餘頭運抵滬　內有初生之犢四十上一頭　將分配與學校醫院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國敎會方面贈送我國之第一批乳牛七百餘頭，於去年十二月十九日，自美國大西洋沿岸之紐奧倫斯由S．S．Linderwood　Victory輪戰運起程，越墨西哥灣，經巴拿馬運河，遠涉重洋，適於農曆元旦日淸晨抵達上海，昨日開始起運上岸。</p>
<p>不勝鄉國之思</p>
<p>虬江碼頭畔，此批「異鄕之牛」自起重機中步出　初履客地，大都趦趄不前，似亦不勝其「鄕國之思」。</p>
<p>乳牛在美國登輪之時，共計七百一十五頭，途中因重洋顚簸及熱帶氣候之影響，病死者一十八頭，在船中生產小牛三十七頭，抵滬後前昨兩日又各產兩頭，故在滬上岸之實數共大牛六百九十七頭（其中公牛十九頭）小牛四十一頭。</p>
<p>每日產乳·約六加侖</p>
<p>據悉其中九十餘頭不幸在途中琉產，否則「初生之　」尙不止此數也。此項乳牛之外形並不如想像中之魁偉，且因長途海程之後，均有「憔悴」之感。據管理者言：平均產乳數量每頭每日的爲六加侖，最佳者可產至八加侖，須視環境氣候及飼養得法與否。其平均年齡的在一歲至三歲間，產處美國各地，市價約爲每頭美金一百六十元，運費由聯總負担，估計自美至滬每頭需二百餘元美金。</p>
<p>尚有大批續運來華</p>
<p>所有乳牛係美國各敎會組織之Church　Service　Committee所贈，最初發動者係浸禮敎會，遠在第二次世界大戰前西班牙內戰之時，有敎徒在西班牙目擊當地人民缺乏飲食營養之慘狀，惻然心動，返美後即發動募捐乳牛，後以大戰爆發而終止。戰後繼續此項工作，已先後贈與波蘭意大利等國，爲數不少。贈與我國者總數共二千餘頭，將陸續運來。已抵滬之七百餘頭現暫由行總上海畜牧站飼養，一星期後即將運交領贈機關。分配數額已由行總當局決定，領贈者均係與敎會有關之學校醫院等，以在首都之遺族學校爲最多。</p>
<h3>電信局利用春節　改善長途電話綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海電信局利用舊曆新年，業務校閒期間，澈底測試內部機綫，竭力改善長途電話，以期减少「自載波終端機」經長途電台，以達滬西各戶之「傳輸衰耗」。</p>
<p>電信局自開放特快長途電話以來，除將京滬間原有日式載波電話機元後換有美式機件外，對於京滬兩端「中繼電纜」均有加裝負荷綫圈計劃，以期增進話音。本市方面因與上海電話公司之設備有連帶關係，已由上海電信局發起，與上海電話公司每週召集聯席技術會議，共同商討合作改進辦法。據悉，已商定將「福建路局」中配合長途之設備，予以調整，並增設長途中繼綫十五對，由電信局供給所需一部份材料</p>
<h3>中國沿海樹立戰績　英軍官舉行授勳式　駐滬英總領事親自主持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市英總領事館，最近奉英政府之命，於昨日下午舉行向戰時在中國沿海樹立英勇功績之軍官授　儀式，由英駐滬總領事奧克登主持。獲得勳章者計有「哈納摩勒」號總工程師克雷洛夫斯基，柏拉特上校，布朗司令，霍畢金遜司令等數人。克工程師等所得獎章係古銅質上刻槲葉二瓣之紀念章，並由英戰時首相邱吉爾親筆簽署授勛書。「哈納摩勒」輪在北菲遭敵機襲擊後，險遭沉沒，幸由克氏等奮不顧身，竭力搶修，始吿無恙。</p>
<h3>中國工程師學會　下月初舉行年會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國工程師學會定於二月一日及二日假座本市交通大學文治堂舉行年會，並敦請吳市長，交通部次長凌鴻勛，市參議會會長潘公展，市商會主席徐寄　等演講，並有專題討輪等節目。市工務局，公用局，敎育局，兩路管理局，濬浦局等技術機關，定於二月一日十二時公宴該會會員。是日下午七時，則由吳市長假福州路警察俱樂部招待晚餐，二日中午十二時，江南造船廠及紗廠，聯合招待午餐。該會並定於二日下午七時假逸園飯店舉行年會聚餐，歡迎會員親友前往參加。</p>
<h3>社會服務　春節陰雨連縣氣候嚴寒　本報定廿八日起轉放寒衣</h3>
<p>盼赤貧失業老弱殘廢及失恃兒童准時候領</p>
<p>春節裏連朝陰雨，天氣嚴寒，朔、風怒號，砭人肌骨，一般貧苦同胞，輾轉飢餓綫上，衣食無着，蔽身無所，種種悽慘的情況，實非筆墨所能形容。行政院善後救濟總署上海分署經過了長期的籌劃以後，終於使「施送寒衣」成爲了事實。雖然區區之數不足以使廣大的飢寒軍衆都獲得溫暖，但對於一般引領企盼的貧苦同胞，確是出乎意料的喜訊！</p>
<p>這次發放寒衣，以一般赤貧失業確有需要者爲限，更以老弱殘廢。失恃兒童爲優先對象，務使這般貧苦同胞及早獲得慰藉，行總上海分署這次發放寒衣，委託本市各慈善團體代爲辦理，本報受託代發四百件，日內即可領到，茲定於本月廿八日起，每日上午九時至十二時，在本館施放，凡需要此項寒衣者，讀備就收據，隨帶身份證戶品證或其他證明文件，來館候領，至發完爲止，但證件不符手績不合及在別處已經領得者，概不發給。</p>
<h3>爲孤寡貧病的人們請命　節約濟貨　功德無量</h3>
<p>晴霞孤寡貧病濟金徴募捐款</p>
<p>農暦新年，無論老少男女，都以興奮歡忻的情緒來迎接遍愉快的日子，富有的人家，孩子換上了新衣，袋裏裝滿了糖果，大人們相互的歡宴着，豪華奢侈，一擲萬金。但是窮苦的人們呢，他們依然在飢饑綫上掙扎着，衣不得暖，食不能飽，任憑命運之神的排佈。但是我們能够看他們凍餒挨餓而不生絲毫同情之心嗎？不！決不！我們只要將春節裏的糜費些微節省一點下來，去救濟他們，也許就能使他們得不少的慰藉呢！本欄主辦的晴霞孤寡貧病救濟金·是我們施舍的最好機會，讀諸君趕快的佈施罷！</p>
<h3>聞蘭亭病況轉佳　將開刀割治腸癌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在海格路紅十字會醫院就治之聞蘭亭，經該院數日細心之注射與診治，體氣已較人院時稍佳，然病狀仍未脫險境。該院於除夕日曾用X光透視，並於當日開刀爲其割治腸痛，擬經十數日休養，體質復元後，將第二次動手術。聞氏昨日熱高爲卅九度，呼吸仍現急促，經院方許可，家屬在院護侍。</p>
<h3>恭禧發財　三輪車夫獅子大開口出差汽車挨着號碼坐</h3>
<p>一塲春雨，淅淅瀝瀝的，多少使新春减些色！</p>
<p>回憶過去一年內，在經濟不大穩定之中，各業終算勉强渡過，有人認爲已是僥天之大倖。</p>
<p>雖然爲了年賞問題，曾經鬧得滿城風雨，但是有些行業，却在皆大歡喜中，令人「刮目相看」：據說××二廠的廠長，單單年賞一項就分得了一億二千萬，就是一個普通的技術人員，亦在千萬元以上；中紡公司亦不算太差，職員一律加發四個月·此外，有幾家顏料行在去年一年中，亦着着實實，賺上一筆，因此每個職員的年賞，起碼在三千萬元以上；這對一般行家，不免要發生些「刺激」作用。</p>
<p>新年了，大家不能免俗，見了面，拱拱手，作個揖，脫口喊聲：「恭禧發財」！</p>
<p>「年初一」，一位電車査票員碰見了售票員，照例的說聲：「發財！發財！」</p>
<p>賣票員似乎很幽默：答道：「發財不是賣票的事，否則就要揩油了」！</p>
<p>拜年，春節中一個大節目，出差汽車做了好生意。人多車少，大家挨着號碼乘車，不少從上午掛了號，到下午才坐到了車，</p>
<p>三輪車，亦看準了這一點，獅十大開口，說起來「新年新世」，大家不在乎？似乎車夫亦雨順了口，開口動輒上萬了。如果我們估計得不太高的話，三輪車夫平均一天的收入，少說說起碼應在三十萬元以上。</p>
<p>戲院中，亦都做了一筆好生意，擁擠的狀態，真可說得上「水洩不通」。影片商爲迎合一般觀衆的胃口，大家都拿出些「粉腿」「玉臂」來號召一下，於是乎「錦繡天堂」，「玉堂富貴」，「金馬玉堂」，「夜夜春宵」……都應時而生了。在在表現出「歌舞昇平」的一派好景象來！</p>
<p>這裏：附帶的還有一筆好生意，一張「飛票」已經賣到八千元了。</p>
<p>至少可以說，表面上「年初一」還算平安無事。「年初二」地檢處僅僅收到警察局一件案子，這或者亦是大家忙着過年的緣故吧？</p>
<p>新春開始，萬象更新，在此少說喪氣話，所謂「往者已矣」！一年之計在於春。願大家今晚接個好財神，今年過個「天下太平」年！</p>
<p>最後：我們用極興奮的情緒，來迎接這個「猪年」，希望今年肉價能夠領導百業，一切物價步向下坡路！則吾國吾民，幸甚！肉價能够領導百業，一切物價步向下坡路！則吾國吾民，幸甚！幸甚！</p>
<p>豬！希望你領導百業物價轉向下破路</p>

<h3>央行拋壓　烚赤屢漲屢回　股鈔躍躍欲起　傳有大批黃金抵埠</h3>
<p>烚赤在休刊期中，極爲惃亂。一月二十一日（發曆大除夕），上落最鉅，晨初四一三萬至四一五萬，即遭央行歷迫，逐步回低，十時後央行以三二九九萬之價，配給五八〇條，而破入四〇〇萬大關。此後央行明配之外，隨市以四〇一萬四〇〇萬三九六萬等價，拋售殊力，實銷奇暢，買戶倍極殷切，是以雖被小至三九四萬左右，午刻仍回出四〇〇萬外。午後因央行管制吿止，實銷仍旺，不久越出四一〇萬外，五時後，仍有交易，市價已喊高至四二〇萬外，傍晚曾有四三〇萬之成交。一月二十三日，各號除代理配給者外，成無交易做開，塲外喊價初爲四二五萬至四三〇萬，迨十時後央行以三九三萬之價，配給五〇〇條，最後喊價减低至四〇五萬。兩大中央行明配暗售，不下萬餘條，美鈔黑市在六千八至七千一，港幣站一四〇〇元左右。</p>
<p>華股於一月二十三日，紅盤登塲，各股開出見高，後以央行以低價本給黃金，人心稍軟而見回，但小股尙見秀色，結果較封關前計永紗，景福，勤興，華豐，均漲起少許，美亞跌半成，信和，新光微挫，冷股均見微升，遞交永紗，新光，信和微降，勤興，華豐稍漲，美亞回跌半成。</p>
<p>一月廿四日，烚赤昨有少數金號業從事經營，是以市價及成交已較前日爲靈活，晨開四〇三萬至四〇六萬，後以配給關係，買戶有所顧忌，而退入四〇〇萬內。十時後，央行仍以三九三萬之價，配給一四七〇條，此際曾盤低至三九五萬，嗣後壓力轉弛，買戶亦殷，而回出四〇〇萬外。午刻見高至四一〇萬，金業會員之銀樓掛脾飾金自四十二萬掛升至四十二萬四。</p>
<p>華股昨爲新春第二日交易，成交仍不見多，十一時後，交易更淸。晨開見低，因央行削價配給，並傳大批黃金抵埠，人心見怯，開後賣戶續殷，二二四號一一〇號三一號一五八號等供給遞永紗，降低至七八五元，三五號逢低納現永紗，一九八號二三一號亦進，惟因八九號等尙售，而微掙扎，無如塲外續高，金市亦回，一五六號一六九號一八〇號二二三號等均進，近午遞永紗回升至八〇七元，而後轉盤，午收呈現遞同價，結果較前收計永紗新光勤興微升，美亞華豐稍降，景福平平，遞交永紗信和微挫，美亞勤興華豐微升，新光尙平，冷股成交見稀，稍見微降。</p>
<h3>生產貸欵　貸出達六百餘億　成立稽查團加強稽核</h3>
<p>聯總處生產事業貸款，臨時　核委負會，在滬開始工作月餘，該會在政府與國家金融機構負責人，曁金融工商領袖工礦專家協助下，凡繼續生產之各種事業，而切需低利貸款輔助者，無不以適當資金貸予，凡運銷等商業，概未辦理。生產事業已貸放達三百餘戶，貸款額有六百餘億元，政府此種措施，俾予工鑛及一般生業事，頗多帮助，滬市生產界多受實惠。又該處爲便已貸出款項廠商，能將所貸之款，切實運用於增加生產起見，並已成立稽核團，加强稽核，以符政府興辨此次生產貸款之初旨云。</p>
<h3>中紡公司　週一恢復售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨因農歷新年關係，雖已恢復辦公，惟未循例開紗，現已決定於下週一恢復售紗。</p>
<p>又該公司訂購之陜西棉花，第一批一百五十噸，昨已抵滬聞前後將有一千五百噸到滬。該批棉花每担抵滬價，的合法幣十五六萬元，可供紡四十二支左右之棉紗云。</p>
<h3>紡管會　召開例會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第二十一次例會，原定本週四舉行。茲以適値農歷新正假期，現已延至今日上午十時在市府會議室開會，屆時將續商收購紗布問題。聞六區棉紡公會，對第一批應歸政府收購之紗布通知單，迄未塡就送會。故今日會議後，當將設法催速工作之進行云。</p>
<h3>輸入管理委會　加緊審核發證</h3>
<p>新正並未休假</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執委會所屬各部門，以工作繁冗，故農歷新正期間，並未休假，同時並加緊審梭及發證工作。聞已發之許可證中，以汽油及燃料油佔最多，其次爲枕木等急需之器材，以應緊需云。</p>
<h3>茶葉押款　農行貸出一百二十億元　中信局收購價格尚未決定</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行舉辦之茶葉押款，原分自資及茶貸加工兩種，押款額各核定六十億，共爲一百二十億，現是項押款額業已全部貸出，而自製加工部份之茶葉，尙有陸續運來者，該行爲扶持茶業決繼續辦理，押款額可能爲三十億，正與中央銀行洽商轉質押手續中。該行此次所辦之茶葉押款，最初限於屯溪，平水，溫州，祁門等四區，繼增加兩湖，寗州，福州等三區，故押款額一再增加之後，猶不敷用，關於上項押款茶葉，由中信局收購，決無問題，惟收購價格，與茶葉品級等，尙待有關各方一度會商後，始能作最後決定。</p>
<h3>日本首批生絲兩週內可抵英　每磅三十五先令</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕貿易部今日發表：自珍珠港事變以來首批輸英日絲，將於爾週內抵達，並將以每磅三十五至三十六先令之價格售諸製造商。</p>
<p>此批貨物共計一六〇·〇〇〇磅，爲今年預計由日輸英之一。〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅訂貨之第一批貨物。</p>
<p>據發言人稱：此批日絲中大部將供絲襪製造商用，其出品中三分之一將輸往國外。該發言人又稱：英國與盟軍最高統帥部訂有條約，日本輸出之生絲，英國應得百分之六，但此項的定將逐漸失效，因目前已漸恢復私相授受之交易，但定貨必須經過政府，因私人經營之商行不能直接與日人發生交易云。</p>
<h3>工礦生產器材　台省統籌購置</h3>
<p>省當局爲加强生產力量，改善人民生活，決對公營礦廠及企業公司之生產器材，均作通盤計劃之充實。嗣後各礦廠公司需要購置上項器材者，聞有關方面已分別通知務於短期內詳細塡報，以便統籌辦理。</p>
<h3>日本生絲銷路呆滯　棉貨則較樂觀　美陸軍當局之觀察</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕美陸軍當局對於日本絲貨及棉貨出口，頗爲注意。査日本之主要進口貨，均以此項出口貨充作資金。戰前日本輸出之全部絲貨的八分之七爲美國所收買，其中的百分之九十供製造絲襪之用。但官方認爲尼隆絲襪（俗稱玻璃絲襪）之流行，將使日本絲在美銷路大爲减少。目前日本可供出口之生絲的計十五萬包，每年出產生絲約十二萬五千包。倘此項生絲能全部銷售，則可减少佔領軍費用。但目前日本生絲銷路呆滯，僅能銷去二萬包，的値美金二千五百萬元。故美軍當局對日本生絲前途殊感焦慮。惟對於日本棉貨則較樂觀。日本已自美國獲得剩餘原棉計值一萬萬五千萬元，而以日本棉貨輸出品爲交換。據目前對日負責之美軍當局稱，此項辦法有四種利益：（一）使日人獲得職業；（二）使日本能藉出口貨獲得主要進口所需化資金；（三）使日本能製造遠東所亟需之棉貨；（四）使日本善爲利用美國政府之剩餘原棉。</p>
<h3>經濟部擬加強業務　辦理國外商情報導</h3>

<h3>商業行莊復員問題　錢幣司解釋處理經過</h3>
<p>頃　月十一日貴報社論，經濟問題的焦點一文，語重心長，彌深佩仰，所舉各點，主管當局早經注意，或正在尋求、解決途徑之中，惟篇首（一）商業行莊的復員問題內稱：「申請期限展至卅五年七月十五日爲止，並沒有　准再展，但事實上，申請復業，聽說迄今還可以接受。」則與事實不符，査商業行莊申請復業期限續展至卅五年七月十五日爲止，在七月十五日以後申請者，財部絕對不予受理，其在各地於七月十五日以前投郵，到達財部已在七月十五日以後者，騐明郵戳日期，確係七月十五日以前者，方予受理，仍將其信封附卷，以資查考，辦理極爲嚴格·慎重，絕無「迄今又接受」之事實，至目前仍在繼續核辦申請行莊復業之事，（一）係七月十五日以前向部申請而有面補送證件或須調查證件者。（二）綏靖區之行莊，在七月十五日以前，限於事實，未能申請，特由部規定於收復日起，二個月內，辦理申請手續，故七月十五日之限期，在綏靖區應視爲例外，案卷俱在，不難覆按，又各項證件中，須取具當地市縣政府證明，與地方金融關係密切之文件者，緣此項行莊，在戰前旣未經財部註册，自無案牘可稽，茍不由市縣政府予以證明，則各該行莊對於地方之關係如何，財部毫無所知，此爲當時立法之初衷，應爲世人所共諒也，總之，商業行莊復員問題，爲戰後金融復員一繁重之工作，其因此而發生之是非糾葛，財部亦迭有所聞，且已予以絕大之注意及査察，並已發覺僞造證件及假借名義招搖撞騙之事，均先後送請法院究辦，如承辦員司果有藉端索賄之事，並盼社會據實檢舉，財部自應盡法懲辦，以肅官箴而重法紀，惟申請復業行莊，數達一千五百餘家，旣未能一一核准，則懷恨者自亦大有人在，飛短流長，在此惡濁之社會中，事所難免，此則有待於公正輿論，予以抉擇，勿使奉公守法之公務人員太痛心也云。</p>
<h3>對於新訂中央銀行法之意見</h3>
<p>— 王曉籟</p>
<p>民國二十四年五月二十三日國民政府公佈的中央銀行法第二條，規定中央銀行的特權，共有四項；一。發行本位幣及輔幣的兌換券，二·經理政府所　本位幣，三·經理國庫，四·承募內外債。</p>
<p>到了抗戰時期，中央銀行陸續掌握全國票據交換，統一法幣發行，以及管理外匯與買賣黃金的職權，確有成爲「銀行的銀行」之趨勢。</p>
<p>由於這種趨勢的演進，聞此次立法院提出中央銀行法的立法原則，將中央銀行的特權，規定爲下列八項：一·發行幣券，二·代理國庫，三·經理公債，四·買賣生金銀，五·平準國際收支、六·收存銀行存款法定準備金的指定部份，七·辦理票據重貼現，八·辦理票據淸算。</p>
<p>這新的立法原則，揆之近五十年來各國中央銀行發展的途徑，按諸近十年來我國中央銀行演進的事實，尙覺合乎需要。</p>
<p>今後中央銀行的業務旣然擴充如此之多，職權旣然增加如此之大，其與國訂民生的關係，已非昔日可比，尤其是與商業，工業，銀行業，更覺息息相關，有風吹草動之勢。</p>
<p>因爲中央銀行與工商界關係這樣密切，所以有些國家的中央銀行法，明白規定行務委員或理事由農工商業銀行業人士充任之。例如一九二七年公佈的比利時國家銀行第五十四條，規定行務委員九人（即理事）由工商業協會，農會，總工會候選人中推選三人外，其餘行務委負被選的資格，爲商業界工業界銀行界中聲望素著之人士，又如一九二五年的智利中央銀行第三十三條，規定理事十人中，除由股東推選七人外，其餘三人由全國總商會，總農會，總工會，各推選一人。再按一九二七年愛斯土尼亞銀行第二十五條，規定理事的選舉，由商業，工業，農業，合作社及勞工團體提名交由大會選舉之。考之英法，莫不如是。</p>
<p>何以中央銀行的理事或監事，由經濟團體推選一部分呢？研究各國山央銀行制度的學者克敍(Kiech）說的很有道理。他說：「一國經濟組織商業狀况的柑互關係，至爲複雜，中央銀行的一舉一動，時時足以給它重大的影響。如以貼現的利率而論，一增一减，工商業中受影響者，利害不一，情况懸殊。若政府對於中央銀行完全控制，不僅易於引起政治上的問題，而且易於發生經濟上的糾紛。故中央銀行於「政策上」應有國家眼光，而於「管制上」則不宜完全受官吏的支配。即使資本歸國家負祖，而在行政上仍應使其獨立。」</p>
<p>克氏這一段話，確有見地。將來我國的中央銀行，爲着管理上運用得宜，爲着政策上配合國民經濟情况，應由商業，工業，農業，銀行業，保險業，各界人士，參與理事監事的職務，一方面使其永遠成爲「銀行的銀行」，一方面使其眞正成爲「全國人民的銀行」。</p>
<p>至於經濟團體參與理事監事職務的辦法，從立法的技術上說：或者由各經濟團體自行推選數人，或者按舊中央銀行法之規定，「中央政府就實際經營商業，工業，農業，及銀行業者選派若干人。」</p>
<p>聞新訂中央銀行法規定資本來源，完全由國庫負担，變爲國有國營。若果將來成爲事實，並不影響上面我所提供的意見。因爲由國庫所供給的資本，也是由人民負担出來的，旣係由人民負担，就應讓各經濟團體的代表，有參與的機會。</p>
<p>根據我國十年來由央銀行職權的擴大，以及各國中央銀行組織的成例，略述意見如上，以表衷心的殷望。</p>

<h3>交大經費支絀　教授欠薪三月　學生自治會電朱教長陳訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國立交通大學學生自治會，頃電呈敎部朱家　部長云：「竊聞敎育乃國家百年之大計，建國之動力，故蔣主席屢以「敎育第一」昭勉國人，然時至今日，交大因經費遭受不合理之緊縮，形將停頓，全校同學，痛心曷極！夫交大有五十年光榮之歷史，國人莫不愛護，雖屢經磨難，益能發榮滋長，蔚爲建國動力。回溯戰時國家財政雖極端困難，而交大尙差堪維持，今獨於和平建國之肇始，受此空前厄運。摧殘敎育之咎，鈞長將請誰負之？聞本校敎授有欠薪三月者，校方不得已以大一分利息貸款墊發，而利息尚須教授每月負擔五萬元，言之憤慨！復以職員數額過少，行政效率迂緩，每學期皆須拖延二月，始能上課，無限時光，皆被斷送。延誤三千同學學業之咎，又將請誰負之？反觀北大中大，北大有學生三千人，而敎職員一多人，中大有學生五千人，而敎職員一千三百人，今交大有同學三千二百餘人，而敎職員不過四百多人，相比之下，殊不知敎部以何種尺度算之？吾則何厚於彼而薄於此耶？百思英解！本校全體同學於羣情憤慨之餘，莫不引領以待鈞長公正合理之處量。今本校經費已瀕臨絕境，經常費之不足維持，敎職員之無理緊縮，直接使同學學業遭受嚴重之威脅。憤怒之情旣起，盡爲年靑人，將無法壓抑，若非圖滿解決，則交大上下，風雨局心，將繼續有所表示。幸鈞長核之！謹此電呈，敬頌鈞安」。</p>

<p>上海勝沖繩島　廿二日起，値農曆新　休假，各報停刋，體育館內，並不熱鬧，元且下午二時，該賽共有二幕，首塲由上海隊迎戰冲繩島隊，開賽後，冲繩一路領前，至十四比五時，上海漸見得手，各十七平手後，上海隊脫頴而出，反以廿二比廿佔先，惟冲繩亦不肯示弱，力爭之下又見抬頭，上半時結果，上海隊以廿八比卅三落後。易籃後，上海隊發揮威力，着着進逼，冲繩遂吿不支，結果上海隊以六十比五十七獲勝。</p>
<p>天津淘汰日本　周日第二塲，天津對日本之役，接觸後，日本隊曾以十五比十一佔先，天津隊窺得對方弱點，改變戰略，運用遠射，十發九中，上半時終塲，日本隊以廿七比卅五落後。休息後，易陣再戰，天津隊賴人材平均，仍一路領前，日本隊力圖挽回頽局，終以缺乏聯絡，鐘聲嗚時，以五十九比六十八遭天津淘汰。</p>
<p>天津再勝表島　廿三日（初二）下午三時，由靑島與天津對壘，觀衆仍不多，天津首開紀錄，靑島僅賴罰球得分，天津再接再厲，獲分累累，上半時完畢，靑島隊十分，天津隊廿七分。易籃後，再度交鋒，靑島隊雖力圖振作，奈天津聯防嚴密，無隙可乘，靑島後防空虛，天津猖獗異常，總結果，天津隊以六十二比卅一擊退靑島隊，獲得決賽權。</p>

<h3>雙漸蘇卿諸宮調的作者</h3>
<p>— 葉德均</p>
<p>宋金元諸宮調流傳於現在的，計有三種：一是劉智遠諸宮調，內中有敎坊廢置不用的商角調，其製作年代當較早，似爲宋人之作；二是西廂記諸宮調，金董解元作；三是天寳遺事諸宮調，元王伯成作（有新輯本）。此外在西廂記諸宮調及元石君寳諸宮調風月紫雲庭，叙述唱諸宮調的曲中，還有一些諸宮調名目，雙漸蘇卿諸宮調便是其中之一。</p>
<p>書生雙漸和倡　蘇小卿的故事，在宋元南戲及元雜劇中，已有三四種，元人散曲叙述或涉及的，有數十套之多，成爲通行的典故。本事見明梅鼎祚靑泥蓮花記卷七。百二十回本水滸傳第五十一回，記白秀英在勾　作塲說唱豫章城雙趕蘇卿，便是演唱這雙漸蘇卿諸宮調。這本諸宮調雖散佚不存，但　的作者尙屬可考，而論者則迄未涉及。元夏伯和靑樓集說：</p>
<p>『趙眞眞·楊玉娥善唱諸宮調，楊立齋見其謳張五牛，商政叔所編雙漸小鄉……』</p>
<p>按靑樓集之說，確有所本。楊朝英太平樂府卷九楊立齋鷓鴣天詞及哨遍散套也記此事。首有楊朝英小序·說：</p>
<p>『張五牛。商政叔編雙漸小卿，趙眞眞善歌·立齋見楊玉娥唱其曲，因作鷓鴣天及哨遍以詠之。』按鷓鴣天詞下半闋云：</p>
<p>『啼玉　，咽冰弦。五牛身後更無傳，詞人老筆佳人口，再喚春風到眼前。』哨遍套末三曲云。</p>
<p>「〔二煞〕靜悄悄的誰念他？冷淸淸的誰問他？尙有人見鞍思馬，張五牛創製似選石中玉，商政叔重編如添錦上花。碎把那珠環　，四頭兒熱鬧，枝節兒熟滑。</p>
<p>「〔一煞」俺學唱，咱學說，咱誰敢前輩爭高下。趙眞眞先占了頭名榜，楊玉娥權充個第二家。替佛傳法，　敲月面，板撒紅牙。</p>
<p>「〔尾〕須不敎一句兒訛，半字兒差。唱一本多愁多緒多情話，敎您聽一遍風流浪子煞。』（涵芬樓景印元刋本載此套缺後半，明萬曆活字本收全套。）</p>
<p>據上列記載，雙漸蘇卿諸宮調是張五牛，商政叔二人所編。靑樓集明說是諸宮調，而太平樂府小序却未指明，但據哨遍套「俺學唱，咱學說」，則明是諸宮調，因爲牠正是又說又唱的。</p>
<p>這本諸宮調的「剏製」者張五牛，便是南宋初年首創「賺詞」的人。耐得翁都城紀勝，吳自牧夢梁錄卷二十，吳曾能改齋漫錄卷一，都有相同的記載。夢梁錄云。</p>
<p>「紹與年間，張五牛大天，因聽動鼓板中有太平令或賺鼓板（即今柏板大節抑揚處是也），遂撰爲嫌。」</p>
<p>張氏創「賺詞」於紹興間，諸宮調似亦這時所製，上距熙寗元祐（一〇六八——一〇九三）首創諸宮調的澤州孔三傳，只有八九十年。</p>
<p>重編者商政叔，名道，元人，官學士（見鍾嗣成錄鬼簿「前輩已死名公」）。元好問稱其：「滑稽豪俠，有古人風。」所作除諸宮調外，尙有散曲。陽春白雪前集五，收天凈沙小令四支，太平樂府卷六有月照庭一套，樂府新聲卷上錄新水令，一枝一（二套），梁州第七，夜行船，風入　六　，　　　　　　「　　」中別有風入　一套：共存小令四支，　套八套·其詞屬清　　，阴寗獻王朱　太和正音譜　　：政叔之詞「商如朝霞散踩」。</p>

<p>人類的言語，不絕減；詩也不絕滅。</p>
<p>人類的聲音，不絕滅；詩也不絕滅。</p>
<p>人類的夢與希望，不絕滅；詩也不絕滅。</p>
<p>人類決不能有一日脫離了語言，聲音，夢，希望，詩，而獨立生存……</p>
<p>在人性遭受了迫害，或生命重負着更多的苦難時，人類最忘不了語言，聲音，夢，詩……</p>

<h3>雲旗二章</h3>
<p>— 胡牧</p>
<p>雲</p>
<p>雲，閃　在黃昏的碧藍色的天空裏，白色的雲，赭色的雲，天藍色的雲，丹　色的雲呀……有　的天氣，我便善歡拄着手杖出門，於是美麗的雲絮，堆滿了我愛的小橋，流水，村舍，綠野……</p>
<p>我愛雲。因而我生活在雲多霧多的山谷裏，在這靜穆的山谷中，我忘記了春天，秋天。</p>
<p>但，我永遠記掛着那雲塊外，依然是白雲飛流，溪水淙淙的故園，呵：那親愛的　暖的泥土上，有正盼望我回　的家人，有正盼望我回歸的野花，牛羊羣………</p>
<p>雲呵，我要駕你銀潔的白帆，帶着永恒的歡笑，航行到山外。</p>
<p>雲呵，你像參一般飄在我的心境里。</p>
<p>我像詩人雪萊爲西風而歌，而我則寫着，「美麗的雲塊，升上藍天」的詩。</p>
<p>雲呵，我每天爲着你，才堅實的生活着。我每天爲着你才寫出人類受難的樂章呀……</p>
<p>雲，白色的雲是我們的旗，是一首和平的招展的白旗。……</p>
<p>火紅的雲，是我們流灑過的碧血，天藍色的興，是我們追求着幽美底夢呵……</p>
<p>我愛着流動在玉藍色的天海上，於是，我的呼吸有海洋的氣息，我追照着那些海邊的日子，有我的愛與恨，有找靑梅竹馬童年的印跡。</p>
<p>我想戀着　，一直到村野的人家，都燈火齊明的時候。</p>
<p>，招展着，我响望着，一直到黑夜偸偸地從羣山的四　升起來的時候。</p>
<p>旗</p>
<p>我愛戀着旗。</p>
<p>旗，獵獵地招展着，飛躍着，鹽展着。</p>
<p>我愛我們的旗，旗，　展在隊伍的前面底時候，於是，我們的意志，便追求着旗，旗，指揮着我們前進前進，……</p>
<p>在無邊的　　的　塲上，我們在旗的號召下，結成了一條堅固的隊伍，像一條火燒不　的　鍊，爲着中國的快樂與自由，我們微笑着出發進軍……</p>
<p>旗，速結着旗。</p>
<p>有旗的地方，便有我們親愛的人民與同志。</p>
<p>因爲，我摯愛着旗。所以，我在　蕩的大旗下，繼續的走，走到那敢笑，敢哭，充滿着有聲有光的地方……</p>
<p>有了意志的旗，我們才有眞正的光明的道路。</p>
<p>有了正義的自由的旗，我們才能獲取快樂與自由。</p>
<p>旗，招展着，飛躍着，　展在我們靑年人的行列裏。</p>
<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>聽琴歌</p>
<p>丈夫意氣雄四海，却斂四海歸一心，焚香掃地坐瞑目，忽聽蕭蕭松樹林。寫我胸中意，因君指上琴。指上一弦一回轉，巫峽淸秋白日晚。玄猿嶺上嘯初低，孤鶴雲中聲漸遠。飛堅流泉思無窮，淥水淸商宛轉通。春禽秋葉心魂外，餘響飄音夢寐中。海上移情三萬里，樓邊窺月十二重。此時江月與江水，空明無際淸無比。水月湛湛蕩幽襟，丘壑一一生弦指。哀音變調忽悽切，腸斷關山雨風雪。易水荆卿宋意歌，河橋蘇武李陵別。仰視浮雲太始初，乾坤萬古島過虛。世上功名何足貴，且莫寥落琴尊味。</p>
<h3>貝珠篇</h3>
<p>— 蔣敦</p>
<p>像貝殼，像珍珠，像星星，無論是在海邊，在海底，在天空，我們都有着我們自己的光輝！</p>
<p>在海邊銀色的沙灘上，貝殼像天上的星星那樣多。每一個貝殼上都遺留着海的波紋。赤着脚檢拾貝殼的人啊，你們除了在海灘上印留了無數的足痕，你們是吾已檢得了海的智慧——容納了一切，而又給一切以光彩！</p>
<p>冒險的採珠的人，到海底去尋覓那圓潤的珍珠——那母蚌一生辛勞的果實。爲了增加一點人間的美麗，採珠的人將生命託付給大海，無數採珠的人，在海邊上失去了踪影。於是，在人間却積累了更多的珍珠——像一顆顆天上的星星！珍珠是因着母蚌的災難而生成的，無數的痛苦的成果，才積累成我們的智慧與幸福！</p>
<p>在海邊，仰視着絢爛的星空，每一顆星都是一個理想，一個永恒的象微！拾貝的人們，採珠的人們，愛星的人們，一切愛慕光輝，追求光輝的人，你們的發現都將在偶然的領悟，與痛苦的不斷的努力中。</p>
<p>拾得了貝殼，採獲了珍珠，人在星空下就虔誠的低下了首，人永遠憧憬着那更遼遠更永恒的事物。因此，人自己就有了光輝，像天上的星……</p>
<h3>Recamier夫人</h3>
<p>— 季拉爾</p>
<p>季拉爾（Gerard）也是古典主義的一員大將，尤其是以肖像畫爲特長。他不但能描寫對象的性格而且能充份的表現時代精神。</p>
<p>賴卡米愛夫人原是當時社交界的明星，在先正在達維先爲她畫像的時候，季拉爾不甘示弱，也爲她作此肖像，畫面較達維所畫者還大，但他運用了純熟敏捷的技巧較先完成。於是季拉爾一躍得名，變成了當時社會的龐兒。原作藏巴里Petit　Palais。（獅）</p>
<h3>寂寞之夜</h3>
<p>— 楊立達</p>
<p>寂寞逡巡於你的指間，</p>
<p>寂寞逡巡於我的身邊。。</p>
<p>寂寞逡巡於晚風中，</p>
<p>寂寞逡巡於星光下。</p>
<p>寂寞逡巡於幽靜的角落。</p>

<p>「你們的計劃，他差一點弄淸楚了，要不是靑木老師設法，套上一個類似的行動，矇混了他一下。危險得很哩！……但與你本身無碍；他只想看看你們究竟做什麽，所以只設了情報崗位，並不打擊你們的進行。這是他的作風——『寬大爲懷』——知道好在根本你們做不出什麽來。他們防守的嚴密，情報的靈敏，是你們意想不到的。你知道昨天還有誰在那裏？」</p>
<p>「簡直不知道……鶴見讓她多說幾句，好明白一切。</p>
<p>「黑龍會的第三人，圾厲害的「橋本虎之助」，昨晚一切，都是他佈置的，不多幾天，他也要出征了，所以靑木老師命我來幫着您咧……」萍子忍不住有些要笑了。她似乎知道鶴見很討厭她，所以說到幫忙二字，她自己也認爲好笑。</p>
<p>「寬大爲懷是什麽道理？」</p>
<p>「他要您心誠悅服，替他辦事咧。」</p>
<p>「假使我辦的事，有些不合他的計劃？」</p>
<p>「很難，……這個「雌狗」是參加蘭組的，她可能報吿您的一切。她以外，還有很多人咧！」</p>
<p>「你也是其中之一吧！」這回輪到鶴見忍不住要笑了。</p>
<p>「聽您的尊便，不過我是始終愛護您的！……」</p>
<p>「你想我們合作起來，可以設法把「秘緘」弄到手嗎？」立刻換了一個題目。</p>
<p>「您請放心；靑木老師說，我們的目的一定可以達到，就在我下决回國的時候…唉，不過我也是『爲人作嫁』罷咧－將來就是成功，也不見得有什麽好處　　身上」！</p>
<p>「那個令『春子姐』是誰？我還當她是一個男人哩！」</p>
<p>「她是靑木老師劍道系『平野』師祖嫡傳；您覺得厲害嗎？她還有飛索刀，柳葉劍，兩種晴器，沒有施展出來哩。…她現在已是僧侶第三級，不問世事的了」。萍子露出慘然下樂的神色。</p>
<p>「承靑木長老，如此愛護，感激得很；不過我還有些不明瞭……」鶴見吞呑吐吐地。</p>
<p>「大槪不是不明瞭，是不放心吧！…吿訴您，您的一切，他老人家可說已經知道十之八九，他老人家說過，『我們是志同道不合』！然而我們似乎應該秉誠合作！」</p>
<p>鶴見和萍子這裏手指傳着信號談話，對面那個女子，似乎有些知覺，却是微微冷笑，裝作不聞不問樣子，側身瞧着窗外。這時飛機已經起飛多時，穿雲破空，對準那偌大一片與人無爭的破碎山河，狂吼疾進。像這樣一次一次跨海飛行，不知有過多少次，也不知將來還有多少决，更不知要帶來多少煩惱，呌那大地上，要折散多少骨肉，犧牲多少性命，叫那些可憐的兒女，要洒出多少熱血，流出多少傷心的眼淚哩！（第六章完）</p>

<h3>躐蹋年</h3>
<p>— 若斯</p>
<p>俗語有云：乾凈冬至　蹋年。</p>
<p>不知道是不是因爲云年冬至沒有下雨的緣故；陰暦年關天氣老是陰陽怪氣。風風雨雨，的是凄凉。許多「軋」年關迎新歲的人都軋得拖泥帶水，愁眉苦臉，狼狽不堪。</p>
<p>可是總算年關已經軋過，倒的人已經倒了，沒有倒的呢？自然還站在那裏。腰板硬朗的，不消說，依舊挺胸凸肚；實力不足的，無疑已軋得原氣傷足。不過檢討一下：年雖　蹋，但已成過去，前事不忘，後事之師，看看未來，是否有作新的更張的必要？還是老調重彈，準備再軋一個　蹋年？</p>
<p>看看天氣，也確乎有些不妙，過了一個　蹋年尾，接來一個　蹋年初，最近似乎還不像有撥雲霧而見靑天的徴兆。</p>
<p>陰曆年底，天天關心「天氣預測」，天天有「轉佳」字樣，可是天天不「轉佳」，拖了一天又一天，結果却拖成一個「躐蹋年」，而新正還波及，實在不大痛快。</p>
<p>我們看看一年來的和談，談談打打，打打談談，馬歇爾初來中國，全國到處飛，散播和平種子，中國老百姓未免感到有勞調人，不過大家希望兵「馬」「歇」，所以都歡迎和平朋友，不料奔走只管奔走，而談談打打，一直拖到陰曆年尾，馬歇爾飛返美國，軍調部作壽終正寢之狀，兵「馬」雖然不「歇」，而「馬」帥在中國的奔走却要「歇」了。終於拖到陰曆年關，延安拒絕和談使者張治中，和平消息忽然轉僵，也是軋過了一個「躐蹋年」。未兌大失所望。</p>
<p>正年初，天氣固然不大開朗，希望政治天氣不要也　曲同工，能够着　像像樣樣的開朗一下才是，只要政治天氣開朗，即是因軋年關軋塌軋傷，而弄得愁眉不展，狼狽不堪的朋友，也會開朗起來。因爲中國老百姓過了這個一躐蹋年」，實在深切瞭解「　蹋」的滋味了。</p>
<p>真所謂：</p>
<p>「寒天吃冷水，點點在心頭。」</p>
<h3>老百姓可愛</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>過舊曆新年有感</p>
<p>年關以前，一陣「過不了年」的訴苦聲，不料一到新正，便一片恭喜聲，皆大歡喜。難過的一年，畢竟過去了，胡里胡塗地過去了！</p>
<p>這幾天，砲竹喧天，　鼓處處，大家都忘了一切傷心事。這原是中國人的胡塗，其實也正是中國人的好處。他們能容痛苦，能忘痛苦，又能化痛苦爲歡樂，　希望以代懊喪！不必非議這種「難得胡塗」，沒有它，抗戰不能苦撑了八年！</p>
<p>過了運一年，令人不免讚　中國老百姓之太可愛，！　們善於接受苦難，又善於這求希望！</p>
<p>家家戶戶，不論他苦到怎樣，而一臨新春，便都會笑着臉貼上喜氣洋洋的春聯。更難能可貴的，他們能够把希望寄托在子孫身上。此中國之所以下同於印度也。</p>
<p>現實是那麽乘張，老百姓仍然任勞任怨，滿腔熱望，舊曆新正的景像，令人感動！我必須重復一句：老百姓是可愛的！（但　里應該强調的是「老百姓」三字。）</p>
<h3>大赦出獄者談鐵窗風味</h3>
<p>— 厲生</p>
<p>我友何君爭訟入獄，已經飽嘗五月鐵窗風味，除夕前被大赦開釋。故知重逢，恍同隔世。歡欣之餘，暢談獄中境况，光怪陸離，爰特擇錄於下。以下便是他自己所說的話了：</p>
<p>初入牢獄</p>
<p>常我初入牢監的時候，其中規矩完全不懂，他們把我關在一間小房裏，據設新犯人起先必要被關在孤零零的一間　中的；好像入敎一般必要受洗禮一樣。這裏老犯人稱新犯人進入獨人牢監，美其名爲「獨木關」。進入「獨太關」的，除了新犯人外，如果有不守牢規互相扭打等情，老犯人也有被打入「獨木　」的。所以「獨木關」便是犯人最不好的待遇。</p>
<p>「獨木關」之戰：當我關進「獨木關」後，就有一個擔任打値差的老犯人進來，這種擔任打値的犯人，叫做「毛葡頭」。</p>
<p>毛葡頭進來後問我要鈔票，一開口便要卅萬元！當時我氣憤塡膺，把門用力的一碰，打在毛葡頭的頭上，他不留意吃我道着，當時倒了下去，我順手再拉起一塊馬桶蓋，（因爲沒有別的武器）　在他的頭上，再兜心一拳，「毛葡頭」頓時暈了過去，我心內倒害怕起來，可是難友門却都喝彩說：『好！大學生有種！』這時管事的我問爲什麽要在監中行兇，我說他要向我敲詐。</p>
<p>被釘脚鐐：</p>
<p>他們說我犯了牢規，便替我釘了一副十六斤的脚鐐，加以處罰，我慷慨的任他們釘鐐。可是這一下，便「行不得也哥哥！」後來幾個好意的老犯人說：「你這洋盤，釘了鐐，連鐐布也不討一方，怎能走路？」於是有人看我英雄，便自吿奮勇的代要了一塊鐐布，把鍊條用鐐布縛在腰圍裏，還要學走「鐐步」。</p>
<p>我上訴了：「釘鐐收監」這四個字，我在看小說上曾經看到過，再在我郤親　體味到了，他們說要釘我一個月，我釘了一天便受不了！到明天，我便做「報吿」說，毛葡頭要敲我竹槓，我憤而動武，假如說我犯規，那么毛　頭的詐財是應該的嗎？這「報吿」上去，竟蒙恩准，把我的鐐釘　去，　鐐時比釘鐐更難受——十分的痛——可是吃官司也是識字便宜。</p>
<p>結交難友：</p>
<p>我是輕罪，來祗要判徒刑六月，後來法官因爲我受過高等敎育，便再加六月，變成一年。吃一年官司，在牢監中被老犯人卑夷地罵「偸飯鬼」！我初進牢監，便把「毛葡頭」打傷，所以老犯人也降格相待，日子一久，便認識了許多的難友，有殺人越貨的强盜，也有多才多學的政治犯，以及鷄鳴狗盜的扒竊　手。</p>
<p>消息靈通：</p>
<p>有許多人以爲吃官司的犯人，對於外而的新聞一定不大詳細，其實不然，我日子久了，也能出外走動，（在牢監範圍內）或者有時移解牢房，牢房內一間關四個犯人。所以對於各人犯罪的眞相比法官也知道得多，像糧貸安等人犯，一國英　案，都親自看見。一國英還送我一條毛巾，上面噴香的，可是王國英寫的字可太差了像三四年級的小學生。人也很老，已有四十左右了。</p>
<p>獄中珍聞：</p>
<p>燒飯間內都由女犯人主持，女犯人中　周氏，獄中都呌她「十三刀」，「十三刀」面孔像紙錠灰色，赤了脚提水進去。有時她聽見人家呌他「十三刀」，便要馬人：「儂隻浮屍！要末斬儂十三刀」－還有和　作老板一同謀殺親夫的主角，面孔也很難看，眞是奇怪！郁香燉在牢中接濟也不多，現在祗有大學中一批問學而已，袁履登在牢中粘洋火殼子，以解無聊。……</p>
<p>苦中作樂：</p>
<p>在牢監中雖有許多工塲，以及圖書館，但是有時還不免無聊，同獄有一個俄國人，敎我俄文，前敎後忘，我也不感興趣。可是他還要向我宣傳他的一套政治主張。——在百無聊賴中，我們便也想出方法來娛樂，我們在樓上下一層便是女牢，我們把地板挖成一個小洞（老犯人呌挖洞爲開桃園）用一隻洋鐵　生了綫吊食物下去，可是要她們以唱歌或跳舞做代價，我們便在「桃園」口看和聽。</p>
<p>女犯中有許多靑年歌舞能手，有幾個能唱一口好京戲，她們祇要我們有香烟丟下去，她們便跳舞唱歌，可是沒有音樂怎麽辦？百無一策之中，祇有碰「馬桶蓋」做節奏，下面舞得好，唱得有勁，我們的馬桶蓋碰得把馬桶也漏了！</p>
<p>貪汚和漢奸大哭；常我「脫索」後，拿了許多衣被等物出獄，裏面的許多漢奸案犯和貪汚案犯都同聲哭泣，我和難友們相處日久，不免生情，也流着淚出來了。</p>
<p>「不到此地非英雄，再來不値半文錢」這是牢中的對聯。</p>
<h3>小孩游玩塲。</h3>
<p>圖示：世界有名郵船「皇后伊麗莎伯」號內部的一景</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>最近出國的蔣鼎文</h3>
<p>— 孫殿偉</p>
<p>蔣鼎文將軍已於本月三日搭乘美琪將軍號輪赴美，蔣氏臨行前，於輪次語記者稱：「此次出國，純係私人觀光性質，並無其他任務。擬在美勾留半載，然後再赴歐洲其他各地，預計一年後返國，屆時當在各地多留心社會建設及地方行政諾點」</p>
<p>蔣鼎文將軍是一位北伐時的名將，西安事變時，他底忠誠與胆識，更博得了不少的贊譽。任何人想起道位叱咤風雲的勇將，都會肅然起敬。誰知他竟是一個異常可親的人，身材魁搭，面容渾厚，平時雖不常見笑容；但說話時充滿了和氣，蒼朗的聲調，顯映出他底磊落，懇擊的神態，流露出滿懷忠誠。</p>
<p>蔣鼎文將軍，字銘三，諸曁磨石山人。幼年時家境很苦，九歲進團山小學，畢業後因無力升學，毅然出來從軍，那時蔣氏才十八歲，而果敢的精神，却已逾於他人。每逢作戰，蔣氏必奮勇直前。討×之役，蔣氏受了重傷，在陣地上僵臥了十數小時，方才得救。但蔣氏始終面無戚容，不流一滴眼淚，眞有漢壽亭侯割臂取箭時的風度。</p>
<p>蔣氏在我馬倥偬之餘，對於學術的探討，仍是兢兢不息。在黃浦軍校時，蔣氏曾這樣向那時的蔣校長說：「我不怕死，你要我衝鋒陷陣，我絕對服從；但在不需要死的時候，我還希】望讀書。」北伐成功後，蔣氏又要求蔣委員長，把他再保送到陸大或者到國外去深造。但那時委員長對蔣氏倚畀正殷，不願他離開身側，因此沒有答應他底要求。蔣氏在某一次對諸曁旅外同鄕的談話中，就這樣說過：「我底一生，可以說光明森落，俯仰無愧。所吃虧的，便是在幼年時少讀幾句書，使我成爲一個『不學無術』的人，因此每遇到一件事情，往往有絀於應付的感覺，道實在是我一生莫大的遺憾」！從這一段話中，我們可見蔣氏是怎樣的　一個虛懷若谷的人！</p>
<p>這一次，蔣氏畢竟獲得主席的特許，在三號那天乘輪赴美了。他底積壓了數十年的夙願，到今天終於獲償，也差可塡補心靈的缺憾了。</p>

<h3>Further Negotiations Needed for Government Reorganization: Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties Hold Talks in Shanghai; New Peace Proposal Already Delivered to the CCP</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Lei Zhen left Nanjing by car at 3:50 PM on the 24th for Shanghai. It is said that he is there to discuss government reorganization with various parties in Shanghai, as the participation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties in the reorganized government has already been decided in principle; only the method of participation remains to be determined.</p>
<p>[News from Our Paper] This reporter recently met with Mr. Zuo Shunsheng and asked for his thoughts after discussions on the government reorganization. He replied with three points:</p>
<p>(1) All parties believe that for the government reorganization to succeed, the Kuomintang must first change its 20-year one-party style. This change must be thorough, from the central to the local levels, and completely overturn previous habits. Otherwise, non-Kuomintang figures will inevitably have many concerns about participating in the government.</p>
<p>(2) The second chapter of the Constitution regarding the freedoms and rights of the people must be implemented early. Otherwise, if freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association cannot be legally guaranteed, there will inevitably be many obstacles to the future of the reorganization.</p>
<p>(3) Current economic and financial measures are causing people to feel constant anxiety about their livelihoods. There must be appropriate emergency measures taken to gradually stabilize the situation before other matters can be calmly discussed.</p>
<p>[News from Our Paper] The nine standing committee members of the Youth Party in Shanghai held a discussion meeting at Zuo's residence last night to exchange views on matters discussed in Nanjing. It is also said that the five standing committee members of the party who remained in Nanjing will also return to Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Most of the standing committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party have left Shanghai for the New Year, so the party headquarters remained deserted yesterday. When the party's central standing committee meeting, which has attracted much attention, will be convened has not yet been decided. Mr. Xu Chuanlin felt quite tired after negotiating with various parties in Shanghai and Nanjing, and went to Hangzhou for rest on the 11th, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai a week later.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] The capital spent last year amidst the rain and snow of peace talks, but because the Communist Party expressed its rejection, it was as if the gloomy weather had sunk into a state of delay. Most of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Party figures in Nanjing went to Shanghai on Lunar New Year's Eve, leaving Zhang Dongsun, who once met with Chairman Jiang and was also summoned by the American and Soviet ambassadors. Zhang left Nanjing for Shanghai by train on the 23rd. Before his departure, he had a long talk with Lei Zhen, which was said to be related to the government reorganization. The government's statement and new peace proposal were delivered to the CCP office on the 22nd by Fu Jingbo of the US Embassy. The CCP stated on the 24th that the CCP's response to this matter could be found in the Liberation Daily's editorial on the 21st. The article still adheres to its past style, denouncing the government's move as a "new trick." The final paragraph states: "Finally, we express that the CCP and the Chinese people resolutely and urgently demand true peace and true democracy. Based on our own painful experience, we are determined not to be fooled again, [we] must expose Jiang's new trick," and strive to achieve the above two minimum requirements through our own efforts to lay the foundation for true peace and democracy, and will not stop until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] The Secretary-General of the Democratic League, Zhang Dongsun, and the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Committee, Ye Danyi, were invited to Nanjing on the 19th by the US Ambassador Stuart and stayed for four days. They returned to Shanghai by car yesterday (the 24th). This reporter visited yesterday, but Mr. Zhang was sound asleep due to fatigue from the journey. Ye Danyi received the reporter. According to Ye, they had two long talks with Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing, mainly about the Yanjing University affairs, and also expressed their views on the current situation. However, Ambassador Stuart did not express any opinion. Zhang was invited to a banquet by Chairman Jiang on the 21st at noon. Those present also included Madame Chiang, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen. When Mr. Zhang Dongsun went to Nanjing, he carried documents such as the declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League, originally intending to present them to Chairman Jiang. Unexpectedly, they were stolen at the Shanghai station, so Zhang gave a brief report on the content of the declaration at the banquet, and emphasized the hope to stop the civil war and resume peace talks as soon as possible. Chairman Jiang expressed his deep agreement. The matter of government reorganization was not mentioned. When asked if the Democratic League still intends to mediate since the resumption of peace talks is on the verge of despair, Ye replied: The Democratic League is now powerless.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] This reporter visited Shao Lizi tonight and asked about the government reorganization issue. Shao expressed no opinion, only saying: I hope that all newspapers will pay special attention to international developments.</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Interfere in China's Internal Affairs: Resolves to Fulfill Moscow Declaration and Support National Government; Lord Privy Seal Announces in the House of Lords</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British House of Lords held a debate on the situation in China today.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Lord Jowitt, the Lord Privy Seal, representing the government, responded to the proposal by Labour MP Lindsay in the House of Lords that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should jointly discuss the situation in China, stating: Britain has promised in the Moscow Declaration that it will not interfere in China's internal affairs, and will continue to strictly abide by this promise in the future. Chinese affairs are the affairs of the Chinese people. Britain only hopes that internal reconciliation can be quickly achieved in China. If Britain can help, it will do its best to facilitate it. The Moscow Declaration recognizes China's need for a unified and democratic government. Britain continues to recognize the National Government led by Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government of China. Britain will continue to support this government in completing unification and democracy. This is our consistent policy.</p>
<p>Britain will never blindly follow any foreign policy.</p>
<p>However, he also said: If China wants to become a truly democratic country, it must not be subject to the totalitarian rule of one party. Therefore, Britain deeply welcomes the implementation of the Moscow Declaration regarding the expansion of the government's foundation to accommodate democratic elements. He continued: He agreed with General Marshall's expression of dissatisfaction with the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and hoped that all parties and well-meaning elements would unite and work hard for the happiness of the country. Jowitt also immediately denied that Britain's support for the US policy towards China was encouraging the civil war in China, stating that the British government will never blindly follow any foreign policy. Britain's goals in China are the same as those of the United States. The purpose is to trade and maintain a strong relationship with a government with a broad democratic foundation. Other than this, Britain has no other aspirations. Jowitt also denied that Britain was supplying China with arms, and said: As far as he knows, the United States has also not supplied China with arms for several months.</p>
<p>Hopes for China's unification; hopes US will continue to mediate</p>
<p>He went on to express his welcome for China's commencement of establishing a constitutional government, but it was extremely unfortunate that the Communist Party refused to participate. He hoped that the CCP would no longer reject this final opportunity to participate in a democratic government for the sake of national interests so that peace and unification can be achieved. He further hoped that other parties could facilitate the CCP's joining and that the United States could continue to mediate. Britain will do its best to provide moral support to the United States and the National Government of China. Jowitt then mentioned Britain's position in China, expressing hope that British property could be returned as soon as possible. The British government should encourage British businesses to restore their position in China and supply China with what it needs. The Chinese counter-proposal to the Sino-British Commercial Treaty is under study by the British government. He believes that the most important point is to allow British ships to freely dock at various ports along the Yangtze River. Jowitt concluded by stating that according to the Sino-British Agreement on the abolition of British extraterritorial rights in China, the Chinese government should accept all formal responsibilities for the former public concessions. The British government believes that this responsibility should include granting fair severance pay to British employees of the former Public Works Department.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] Sir Lindsay is the father of Michael Lindsay. Michael resided in the CCP area for a long time. He returned to England last year. His wife is Ms. Xia from China. The couple has two children in China. In the future, when he inherits the peerage, his wife will become Lady Lindsay. Ms. Xia will be the first Chinese woman to receive this honor.</p>
<h3>Military Spending Reduced This Year; Government Implements Troop Cuts</h3>
<p>Each army to be reduced by 20%</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] In order to coordinate with the plan to build up the army and the country, and because this year's military spending has been reduced, the government authorities have decided to implement troop cuts. It is understood that the troop reduction plan is currently being drafted. It is said that each unit and military organization will reduce the overall number of officers and soldiers by 20%.</p>
<h3>Pacification Zone Political Committee Holds Meeting to Review Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] The Pacification Zone Political Committee was established three months ago. In order to review its work, it convened a meeting on the 24th, chaired by Bai Chongxi. Yu Dawei, Zhang Lisheng, and others attended. Representatives from the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Food, the Department of Health, the Department of Land Administration, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Cooperative Bank of China reported separately and submitted a general report. According to Chen Kewen, the deputy secretary-general of the committee, who told reporters, the committee's jurisdiction covers more than 300 counties in the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, of which more than 180 counties have been recovered. In the past three months, a total of 724 million yuan in emergency relief funds, 20,000 tons of flour (i.e., 920,000 bags), 50,000 bags of clothing (1.5 million sets), and 500,000 catties of salt have been distributed. In addition, the total amount of demobilization subsidies allocated by various provinces as of January 22 was 8.12 billion yuan. The recovered counties are all exempt from land tax, and subsidies are allocated to the recovered counties, divided into five grades, with the first grade receiving 38 million per county, the second grade 32 million, and the third grade 25 million, totaling 20 billion. This has not yet been fully distributed. In addition, 500 million yuan has been allocated for medical and health care, and medical and disease prevention teams have been organized to go to various places to work. The rest is to subsidize small rural loans, which are handled by the Farmers Bank of China, with a total of 12 billion yuan issued. The Cooperative Bank has issued 4 billion yuan. Only one county in Jiangsu has not yet been recovered. The total amount of requests for various industrial and commercial loans is 50 billion, which the government has handed over to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for handling. The six banks will grant loans according to the actual situation. Those under 50 million can be handled by the banks themselves, and the procedures are simple.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Secretariat Decides to Postpone Closing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] The National Assembly Secretariat had previously decided to close on January 15. Because the handover has not yet been completed, Hong Lanyou told reporters that the closing work is still extremely complicated, and due to transportation issues, more than 80 representatives have not yet left Nanjing. They are now concentrated in the Third Guesthouse.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] The National Assembly representative from Xinjiang, Hademan Qiaojiapu, and others flew back to Dihua by a special plane from the Air Transport Team from Nanjing at around 9:00 am on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Five-Year Economic Plan Approved by Chairman</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Wu Dingchang, the Chief Secretary to the President of the National Government, told the United Press reporter today in a private interview that the Chinese Five-Year Economic Plan has just been approved by Chairman Chiang and submitted to the Executive Yuan for implementation. The total cost, calculated at the pre-war value of three yuan per US dollar, is 220 billion yuan, one-third of which will be paid by the national treasury, one-third by foreign investment, and one-third from the people. This plan was drafted by experienced experts from various fields starting in 1944 and was completed the following year. It was submitted to the Supreme Economic Council for approval at the beginning of last year. The plan is divided into the following parts: (1) Transportation, (2) Industry, (3) Mining, (4) Power Generation, (5) Water Conservancy, (6) Agriculture.</p>
<h3>Lei Qilin Has Been Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Capital Higher Court Prosecutor's Office released National Assembly representative Lei Qilin on bail after the Ningxia Higher Court failed to submit the complete case documents of Lei within the deadline. He was interrogated at 9:00 am on the 20th of this month, and the court ordered him to be released on bail pending further investigation. Lei was released from prison at noon that day.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Arrives in Nanchang</h3>
<p>Will Return to His Hometown of Anyi to Sweep Graves</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 24th] Xiong Shihui, the Director of the Northeast Headquarters, returned to Jiangxi with his family from Nanjing on the Tianxiong special plane today, arriving here at 11:30 am. National Assembly representatives Wang Zhenxin, Li Houzhao, Lai Weiying, Wang Qinghua, and Senator Wu Jiantao were also on the same flight. According to Xiong, the situation in the Northeast is very good, and the Communist Party issue will be resolved politically. When asked about reports that he would soon take over the Ministry of National Defense, he smiled and said that this was just newspaper news. Xiong will stay in Jiangxi for about a week and then go to Nanjing. He is scheduled to return to his hometown of Anyi on the 27th to sweep graves.</p>
<h3>US Loan to China</h3>
<p>Marshall to Urge Re-Preparation</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] A spokesman for the Export-Import Bank announced today that if China wants to obtain the $500 million loan designated by the United States, it must reorganize its economy within five months. In other words, the Chinese government must submit a detailed plan by June 30 explaining how it will use the loan. The United States had designated $500 million as a reconstruction loan for China ten months ago. If the loan is not released by June 30 of this year, it will automatically expire. Marshall urged the Export-Import Bank to store funds to await when he was a special envoy to China last year, in order to induce China to stop the civil war. However, even if June 30 of this year is the deadline for the release of this loan, it does not mean that China will never be able to borrow from the United States. The new Secretary of State Marshall may ask the Export-Import Bank to consider preparing for another loan.</p>
<h3>Famous American Writer Calls for Relief to Chinese Writers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, United Press] Many famous American writers jointly wrote to the editor of "The Nation" magazine, calling for relief to Chinese writers, saying that Chinese writers are in dire economic straits, their works have no market, and publishers are mostly closed due to economic reasons, making business extremely difficult. Many writers have switched to teaching, but due to inflation, their salaries are not enough to support their families.</p>
<h3>Pierson Guilty of Rape in Shen Chong Case; Shen's Father Says His Daughter Will Drop Out This Semester</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 24th] The public trial of the American soldier's assault case was completed on the 20th. Although new witnesses were discovered here among the Chinese and American witnesses presented by both sides, they did not attract the attention of the court. The debate court was opened on the 21st. After the prosecutor announced the key evidence of Pierson's crime, the defendant's lawyer also made a seemingly correct but actually wrong "consensual sex" argument. However, after the prosecutor's rebuttal, the case was closed. On the 22nd, Pierson was declared guilty of "rape." The case proceeded for a total of five days, from the 17th to the 22nd, and everything proceeded according to plan. The reactions from all parties were generally good, believing that the US military authorities' attitude towards this incident was quite enlightened. Now, the only thing to pay attention to is the sentencing. What should be noted here is that the prosecutor also admitted that Pierson committed rape while drunk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, the presiding judge of the military court of the First Marine Division of the US Marine Corps stationed in China, announced that the American soldier Pierson's assault case should be considered rape. The court began at 10:00 am on the 22nd. Those attending the hearing included Hu Shi, Zuo Mingche, Ji Yuan, and 17 Chinese and foreign reporters. First, Assistant Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Young read the interrogation record of the fourth day of the court. Then, the prosecutor announced that he had asked Division Commander General Howard last night whether the third and fifth charges in the indictment should be disregarded. According to the reply telegram, the two charges should be dropped. At this time, the presiding judge was shocked, and the defendant Pierson was alarmed. After only five minutes of discussion by the judges, the presiding judge Lieutenant Colonel Hughes announced that the second and fourth charges in the indictment were not established, and Pierson should be found guilty of the first charge of rape. The announcement immediately ordered the defendant to be returned to custody. It was 10:30 am. The prosecutor then announced the end of the case. As for the sentence to be imposed, it will be announced after it is submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in Washington for review. At this time, the attendees Ji Yuan, Zuo Mingche, Hu Shi, and others shook hands with each other, expressing their joy at winning the case. As for the apology from the United States, it will be held after the verdict is reviewed and announced. Compensation is pending application by the victim's family for separate handling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, told reporters on the morning of the 23rd after the American soldier Pierson was found guilty of rape: I told everyone (local and foreign press) on the 6th of this month that I had confidence that the US military court could make a fair judgment. Now that Pierson has been found guilty of rape, it proves my confidence. This case was judged extremely fairly. Also, it is said that another American soldier accomplice case may be publicly tried by another court next Wednesday (the 29th of this month). This court will be simpler. Also, Shen Shao, the father of Shen Chong, said: He will fly to Nanjing on the 24th. Miss Shen will also return to Nanjing a few days later. She will definitely drop out of school this semester.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] According to related sources, Shen Shao, the father of Shen Chong, came to Beiping to participate in the public trial of the criminal American soldier on a plane from the 332nd Air Force Squadron of the US military. Now that the American soldier has been found guilty of rape, this case has come to a temporary end. It is said that Shen will return to the south immediately, and the US military authorities have prepared a seat on the plane for him.</p>

<h3>French Troops Land on Paracel Islands Again; We Conduct Direct Negotiations; French Ambassador to Visit Vietnam to Investigate the Actual Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Regarding the Xisha (Paracel Islands) incident, the current situation has slightly changed. Before the 23rd, the French side still frankly admitted that the landing of French troops on Baode (Pattle) Island in the archipelago was not ordered by Paris, which would not affect the negotiations and allow the problem to be resolved. Ambassador Meyrier also indicated that he would visit Vietnam to understand the actual situation. However, after French troops landed on another island in the archipelago on the 23rd, the French side's attitude has changed, with attempts to submit the issue to international arbitration. However, our position remains the same, as stated in numerous statements: We will conduct direct negotiations in accordance with treaties and other relevant diplomatic documents to ensure national sovereignty. The giant supply ship "Mawai" Ergon, which recently returned from the United States, has been ordered to load weapons, ammunition, and food and set sail to support the small number of national troops stationed on the islands to strengthen their defenses so as to prevent French troops who have not been ordered by the French government from acting arbitrarily and creating any situation that is more detrimental to harmonious negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] According to authoritative sources: The French Ambassador to China, Meyrier, will visit Vietnam within ten days to investigate the landing of French troops on the Paracel Islands. According to sources from the French Embassy: The landing of French troops on the Paracel Islands was not ordered by the French government. It is believed that it was the French troops stationed in Vietnam. After the Chinese side protested to the French government about this matter, the French side has softened its attitude. The French Ambassador's visit to Vietnam to investigate this matter is to prevent the expansion of this matter in the future.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops in Southern Shandong Capture Zaozhuang; Continue to Eye Lincheng but Meet Strong Resistance; Taierzhuang Still Firmly Held by Nationalists</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 24th] The Communist troops, having amassed over 100,000 men in Southern Shandong, launched a large-scale offensive along the Taizao branch line, attempting to expand the internal strife and threaten Xuzhou. On the 5th of this month, they again launched their full force to attack the Zaozhuang coal mine, the largest coal producer in Central China. Zhou Yuying, commander of the 51st Division of the Nationalist army, was ordered to defend it with two divisions, with the aim of preserving a fraction of the nation's vitality. braving the severe weather of rain and snow, they fought against the Communist troops, who outnumbered them by more than thirty times. Although the Communist troops had broken into the positions several times, they were all bravely repelled. The Communist troops, having suffered nearly 30,000 casualties, concentrated all their forces on the 19th and launched a desperate and fierce attack on Zaozhuang, bombarding it with more than ten heavy artillery pieces and dozens of smaller cannons. The defending troops bravely resisted, repeatedly counter-attacking, the sound of battle shaking the heavens and the earth, blood and flesh flying everywhere. By the afternoon of the 24th, the Zaozhuang coal mine, which the army and the people had jointly defended with bloodshed and hard fighting for fifteen days and nights, was finally captured by the Communist troops due to the vast disparity in numbers, the complete destruction of the fortifications, and the exhaustion of ammunition. Commander Zhou was loyal to the Party and the country, having done his utmost and died a heroic death. In recent days, the Communist troops have again invaded westward along both sides of the Linzao branch line, attempting to seize Lincheng. A strong Nationalist force is currently offering strong resistance. Furthermore, Taierzhuang is still firmly held by the Nationalist army and remains safe and sound. After the Nationalist army gained control of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, it quickly carried out mopping-up operations. At present, there are no large groups of Communist troops harassing the area south of the Longhai Railway in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Yan'an Radio broadcast today that Chen Yi's troops of the Communist Party, after fierce fighting with the Nationalist 51st Division, occupied the important city of Zaozhuang in Southern Shandong on the 20th of this month, inflicting 11,000 casualties on the Nationalist army. The Ministry of National Defense has acknowledged the fall of Zaozhuang, but the spokesman of the ministry stated that the number of casualties of the Nationalist army reported by the Communist Party was "absurd." Zaozhuang was too far from the Nationalist defense line, and was defended by only a small number of troops, so it was abandoned.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 24th] More than 2,000 Communist troops, having sneaked from near on the 20th, reached the Weiji area, more than ten miles north of Suining, and were driven back by the garrison troops. By the 22nd, there was no trace of Communist troops within Suining.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] After the eastern section of the Longhai Railway line was completely controlled by the Nationalist army, the Communist troops in the Zaozhuang area actively adjusted their deployment. Since the 22nd, they have successively passed through Chongfang (50 kilometers east of Yixian) and the area north of Matouzhen, crossed the Yishui River eastward, and seem to be concentrating their main forces on the line east and west of Yicheng and Matouzhen, in order to harass again. (Another report) Small groups of Communist troops have recently sneaked to the southeast of Yutai, and there are signs of them attempting to sneak into Yutai.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Troops Continue to Advance North of Dehui; Few Communist Troops Remain on the South Bank of the Songhua River; Threat to Jilin-Changchun Completely Removed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The Nationalist troops north of Dehui are advancing rapidly. They reached Sima'jia (10 kilometers north of Dehui) on the 21st and entered Dajia'gou (20 kilometers north of Dehui) on the same day, having made contact with the Nationalist troops on the south bank of the Songhua River. Another Nationalist force recovered the line east and west of Jiaojialing. At present, only a part of the 6th Column of the Communist army remains on the south bank of the Songhua River.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Pan Yang, 23rd] After the Communist troops on the periphery of the Jilin-Changchun line were defeated, the threat to the Yongji-Changchun area has been completely removed. Direct passenger trains on the Jilin-Changchun and Changda lines arrived in Shenyang on the 21st, and the people of Changji are quite calm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] According to sources concerned: The Communist radio station of the Changchun Military Mediation Department was sealed off by the local military authorities because the Communist side used the radio station to secretly communicate with the Communist army in Northeast China, facilitating the Communist army's launch of offensives. The local military authorities had no choice but to take this measure for self-defense. (The Communist radio station has now been returned; see this newspaper on the 21st.) According to the Government side radio station of the Executive Headquarters, it had also been sealed off by the Communist side several times before. It is reported that the Government side radio station of the 5th Group in Zhangjiakou was confiscated by the Communist representative leading troops at 6:30 pm on September 18, 1946, and the protest was ineffective. Furthermore, the Government side radio station of the 1st Executive Group in Jining was confiscated by the Communist side at 10:30 pm on September 4, 1946, due to the Communist side's excuse of the then military situation, prohibiting communication.</p>
<h3>Changchun Sees Light Again</h3>
<p>Temporary Circuit Installation Completed</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 23rd] On Lunar New Year's Eve, the weather was extremely cold, reaching minus 38 degrees Celsius, which was rare in recent years. After the Songchang power transmission line was destroyed by Communist troops, Changchun was almost a city of darkness for 102 hours. At 5:30 pm on the 20th, the temporary circuit was completed by the Electricity Bureau, and Changchun saw light again.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Stirring Around Baoding; Over 10,000 Men Fiercely Attacking Dingxian, Currently in Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] Starting at 8 pm on Lunar New Year's Eve, the Communist troops around Baoding simultaneously launched offensives against the Nationalist defense lines on all fronts. Fierce artillery battles broke out at Shigezhuang, Tianzhuang, and Caohe stations south of Xushui. There were battles at the strongholds of Daran in the north and south of the city, Shiqiao in the east of the city, and Huangcha. Residents in the north of the city could hear clear gunfire and artillery fire, and the situation was tense for a time. After 12 pm, the Communist troops retreated, and the battles on all fronts temporarily ceased. The people of Baoding had a false alarm on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 23rd] At 6 pm on the 21st, thousands of Communist troops suddenly attacked the Nationalist strongholds in Qilinbao north of Xuyong, Tiancunbao, and Xizangcun, Jingtangpu, and Shigezhuang west of Xushui. After four hours of fierce fighting, the Communist troops were defeated and retreated to the northwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 24th] Over 10,000 Communist troops have been fiercely attacking Dingxian for days, and are still in fierce battle.</p>
<p>Nationalist Troops Withdraw from Wangdu, Regimental Commander Unfortunately Captured</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] Since the 19th, the Communist troops, with three brigades, have besieged Wangdu. The Nationalist army in the area recently added a regiment, but it was still outnumbered. After fierce fighting, at 10 pm on the 22nd, the local garrison of more than 700 men, led by regimental commander Zhao Hezhen, voluntarily withdrew from the county seat in good order, heading north. Near Fangshunqiao, the Communist troops impersonated the Nationalist army unit number from Baoding and looted westward. When they reached Yujiazhuang Nanlangjiazhuang, the Nationalist army discovered the deception, and fierce fighting broke out again. Regimental commander Zhao Hezhen and more than 300 soldiers were captured. The remaining officers and soldiers, administrative personnel, and refugees, totaling 350 people, fled to Baoding (now living in Sipingzhuang, ten miles southwest of the city). The Baoding Emergency Relief Team has been distributing food and funds since the 21st to provide temporary relief.</p>
<p>Nationalist Troops Confident of Opening Baoshi Railway</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] Amidst the tense situation in Baoding, the reporter interviewed various parties concerned on the 22nd. It was said that the Communist troops outside Baoding were actively moving, attempting to attack the provincial capital and destroy the Pinghan Railway traffic again, which is highly propagandistic. In the current situation, the Nationalist army in Baoding is strong and mostly composed of mechanized elite troops. Although the Communist troops stationed outside the city walls for fifteen miles number more than 60,000, the units with good equipment and combat effectiveness are less than one-third. In terms of combat, the Nationalist army has an absolute advantage. The Communist troops relocated to the west of Baoding and gathered frequently, attempting to stir up trouble. Their intention is nothing more than to seize opportunities to harass or make a show of force. Furthermore, the Nationalist defense line is long and it is impossible for sentry posts to be connected one after another. The Communist troops attack the weak and avoid the strong, resulting in the struggle for small strongholds, local battles, and traffic accidents, which are inevitable. If the Communist troops want to recreate the situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway last year, it is currently impossible. As for the opening of the Baoshi section, the Nationalist army is absolutely confident. However, Baoding is currently fully defending against the activities of the Communist troops in western Hebei, and the opening of this section is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Jinghu Railway to Add New Year Special Trains Starting the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Jinpu and Jinghu Railways had suspended slow trains from the 22nd due to the Lunar New Year holiday. It is now learned that the Jinpu Railway will resume normal operation of slow trains from the 27th, and the Jinghu Railway will resume normal operation of slow trains from the 25th. The Jinghu Railway will also add New Year special trains from the 26th to the 5th of next month. The time is 12 pm every day, adding first, second, and third class special trains. Furthermore, from the 27th of this month, the ships of various small steamship companies will resume normal operation.</p>
<h3>Xue Dubi Replies to Dong Biwu Again, Narrating the Truth about the Damming Project</h3>
<p>Tearfully Pleads for the People in the Yellow River and Huai River Basins</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the Yellow River damming and restoration project, the Communist Party has repeatedly obstructed it. Xue Dubi, chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, after receiving a letter from Communist representative Dong Biwu on January 15 inquiring about various matters, specifically replied to Mr. Dong again, fully answering the true facts as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Our committee had only one conversation with your representative on May 18, 1946, because your party had disagreements with the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission after discussing it. Therefore, representative Zhao Mingfu and others were sent to Nanjing to directly consult with our committee. The minutes of that conversation should be regarded as the basic agreement between the two parties. All progress on the Yellow River damming and restoration project should be based on that agreement. As for the so-called minutes and agreements of previous meetings in your letter, our committee did not participate in them, so it is not bound by them.</p>
<p>Delay in Dyke Construction in Communist Areas Cannot be Attributed to the Central Government</p>
<p>(2) The minutes of the May 18th conversation stipulated that regarding the restoration project, it was agreed that "the downstream urgent restoration project, including dangerous works and partial straightening of river banks, should be completed first, and the entire project should be planned and promoted together" (Original Record 1-1), "The funds required for the urgent project will be fully allocated by the Water Conservancy Commission" (Original Record 1-3), "This restoration work should strive to start construction before June 5" (Original Record 1-4), "Construction matters in the Communist area shall be handled by the Communist Party" (Original Record 1-5). There was a clear agreement on the nature of the project, the completion steps, and the responsibilities for handling it. All the funds required for the urgent project in your area were first transferred to your party in three batches in June and July last year by our committee. Subsequently, consultant Todd went to your area for an on-site investigation and believed that the funds allocated by our committee, together with the grain allocated by the General Relief Administration, were sufficient for the project you did. It can be seen that the Central Government has fulfilled its responsibility to fully allocate the funds required for the urgent project in accordance with Article 3 of the original record. However, your letter stated that the government still owes 4.9 billion yuan and that there is no solution for the funds for straightening dangerous works, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts. As for your letter stating that (straightening dangerous works has not started at all, and the downstream restoration project has been completely suspended since July), it has been found that the downstream restoration project is being handled by the Hebei Repair and Defense Office, and it has been reported that as of December 10 last year, the completed earthwork was (526,899) cubic meters. In Shandong, it is being handled by the Shandong Repair and Defense Office, and it has been reported that as of the end of December last year, the completed earthwork was (866,072) cubic meters. As for the Communist area, it is being handled by your party. According to consultant Todd's inspection report, the completed earthwork was (10,620,000) cubic meters. Both parties have been actively carrying out the downstream restoration work for a long time, and your party has long received the aforementioned funds and grain. If there is a delay in the dyke construction in the Communist area, the responsibility should be borne by your party and cannot be attributed to the Central Government.</p>
<p>Failure to Dam Downstream Will Inevitably Cause a Tragedy</p>
<p>(3) The minutes of the May 18th conversation stated that (regarding the relocation and relief of residents within the downstream river channel, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has submitted a case for approval, and requested the Central Government to designate it for handling as soon as possible, so as to meet the needs of the damming and restoration project). It is reported that more than 30,000 residents in the Yellow River old channel in the Central Government-controlled areas of Henan and Hebei have automatically moved out because they heard that the Yellow River would return to its old channel, and have not requested relief. As for the number of residents in the river channel in your party's area of Shandong, the Central Government cannot find out, and the numbers you have repeatedly submitted are inconsistent, and the number of relocations required is sometimes 15 billion and sometimes 30.4 billion, which makes it even more impossible for the Central Government to know the truth. If you want to conduct an investigation, you have no way to start, so you have to consider it carefully. Fortunately, the funds have been fully allocated to the General Relief Administration by the government, and it is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>(4) The May 18th conversation minutes stipulated that the damming project should (continue to proceed, with the principle of not causing flooding downstream). Our committee not only did not ignore it, but also paid close attention to it long ago. Therefore, during the flood season, we were determined to maintain a cautious attitude and did not dare to actively rush to advance. At present, during the dry season, we must speed up construction, so as to catch up with the time period, which is precisely to make the water slowly flow into the old channel, so that local officials and people along the river can inspect the water flow situation and carry out the repair and maintenance of the embankment work, so as to avoid disasters downstream. The work of repairing dikes has always been carried out at this time. Today, your letter stated that (the government does not care about the downstream dyke work, does not care about the lives and property of the residents in the downstream river channel, but only limits the time for damming), which is completely contrary to the facts. If the damming is postponed for five months according to your party's proposal, it is precisely when the flood season is approaching. If the damming is carried out at that time, not only will there be major technical difficulties and it will be difficult to close the gap, but even if it can be closed, the flood will flow eastward and cause unimaginable floods downstream. As your letter stated, it will be a (world-rare tragedy). The Central Government treats compatriots across the country equally and cannot follow your party's wishes and tolerate this worst policy.</p>
<p>The So-Called Early Water Release is Actually a Communist Pretext</p>
<p>(5) Your letter also blamed us for (releasing water before damming without notifying your party). Regarding this point, please first briefly explain the damming method, and then you can get a reasonable answer. This damming adopted the flat damming method, that is, first use wooden beams to build a temporary bridge to connect the two ends of the breach, and then throw stones from the bridge to form a stone dam to block the water flow, so that the water level gradually rises. At the same time, several ditches are dug in the high places between the water flow and the old channel, so that when the water level rises to a considerable level, the river water gradually enters the old channel through these ditches, which is called the diversion channel. This is the pre-determined plan before construction. In the May 18th conversation minutes, the reservation opinion raised by your party representative only stated that diversion channels should not be dug before the flood season. It can be seen that this construction step was originally very clear. The water passing through the diversion channel on the 27th of last month was caused by the increase in water level and infiltration. This is a natural result of throwing stones to dam the breach. How can it be called (early release of water). Moreover, your party representatives have been stationed at the Huayuankou construction site since the beginning to make contact and liaison. They must fully understand the progress of the project and must report to your party at any time. The announcement No. 2 of the Huang Character of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government of your party, the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office, on November 11 last year, notified the people that the water would return to the old channel and ordered them to quickly move out of the riverbed. This was still forty-seven days before the diversion channel overflowed on December 27 last year, which shows that your party had long known and prepared for the natural result of throwing stones to dam the breach. Now, it is shirking responsibility for not knowing. Who will believe it? If it is said that the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers on the 2nd and 3rd of this month carried reports that Kaifeng, Heze, and Jinan, where the government troops were stationed, were prepared early, compared with your party, I am afraid that the preparation is not as early as your party.</p>
<p>Hoping for Compassion to Avoid Failure</p>
<p>(6) As for saying that our committee "is unwilling to stop the damming project, unwilling to stop the release of water, and takes the pretext of protecting the new flood area, actually inundating the old river area, which will inevitably have serious consequences," whether this serious consequence can occur depends entirely on the situation of your party repairing the downstream embankment. Looking at the above-mentioned announcement of the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office of your party, it has already been rushing to repair the embankment and relocate residents, and it is estimated that it has been completed. Even if it has not been completed, it can be rushed now, so it is delaying repairs, which is watching the disaster of more than 7 million people downstream without prevention. Your party should bear the responsibility for this. From a technical point of view, the damming project is really not to be delayed at this time, because the damming stone dam is made of thrown rubble. The current water level has been raised, and the water pressure on the stone dam is very large. The water flow rushing up and down is enough to destroy the entire dam. If it does not advance, it will retreat. Once it stops, all the work will be abandoned. Moreover, the stone dam design uses the low water flow in winter for construction. Now is the most critical time for rushing to dam. Judging from the current width of the gap, if the flow of Shanzhou exceeds 1,500 cubic meters per second, there will be a great danger, and the ice jam season is approaching. Once the ice floes flow downstream, the temporary bridge and the stone dam will be destroyed together. Even if the ice jam season can be survived, the danger will be even greater during the peach flood season three months later. The completed project will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, the stone throwing work must continue. As for sealing the gap and cutting off the flow, it may be slowed down a little. This situation was discussed in detail in Shanghai yesterday. This should be understood by your party.</p>
<p>There is still something to say. Our committee is a career organization, only knows to work hard for Yongli construction, and is extremely willing to do its utmost to get the joint cooperation of all parties, so that this water conservancy undertaking related to people's livelihood and national economy can proceed smoothly, so as not to fail the country and not to be ashamed of the people. My compatriots in Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces have suffered from the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the disasters of floods during the eight-year war of resistance. Now, it has been more than a year since the victory, and these people are still in dire straits. The heart of compassion is common to everyone. Even if there are differences in political views, how can we bear to let this Yellow River damming and restoration project, which is about to be completed, fail because of the war? I sincerely plead for the fathers and folks in the Yellow River and Huai River Basins with a red heart and tears, hoping for compassion and helping this completed achievement. I will be grateful to the utmost.</p>
<h3>Chairman Orders Guangxi Provincial Government to Levy Sufficient Land Tax within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guilin, 24th] Chairman Chiang ordered the provincial government by hand, as the time limit for the Guangxi province's in-kind levy of land tax has passed, and less than 60% has been collected, to collect the full amount by the end of the month. The provincial government has strictly ordered the counties to collect payment.</p>
<h3>Our Consul in Jambi Arrives in Batavia, Announces Indonesian Military Atrocities, More Than a Thousand Overseas Chinese Killed and Injured, Bodies Dismembered</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 22nd] Our Consul in Jambi, Chen Yuanping, arrived here by plane this afternoon, and is scheduled to visit Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir with our Consul General in Batavia, Chiang Chiadong, tonight. Mr. Chen will also provide Sjahrir with photos of the dismembered bodies of overseas Chinese killed in Indonesian atrocities, as well as photos of overseas Chinese houses destroyed by Dutch artillery fire and Indonesian arson. He said during an interview with reporters: According to reports and observations received before the 17th of this month, it is estimated that 250 overseas Chinese were killed, thousands were lightly and seriously injured, and more than 600 were missing in Jambi alone. Currently, 6,000 people have registered to request relief from Chinese organizations. This number is not the final figure, as it has been discovered that some overseas Chinese have been kidnapped and assassinated by Indonesian elements. Regarding the property losses of overseas Chinese, Mr. Chen estimated the figure to be 5 million Straits dollars. He believes that both the Dutch and Indonesians should be responsible for this loss. He said: There were no street battles in Jambi. The Dutch army caused this unnecessary disturbance by using artillery and aircraft to assist naval gunboats in bombing the city. The armed Indonesian troops took advantage of this chaotic situation to burn, kill, loot, and plunder before retreating to a place 20 kilometers away from the city. It is learned that the Dutch army only had one soldier killed who was holding a hand grenade before the war, and another soldier died in the hospital. It is also reported that the Sumatran Indonesian authorities announced that a total of five Indonesians died, so the Dutch and Indonesians only had a total of seven deaths in the war. Consul Chen said: There is a severe shortage of food in Jambi. The relief ships from Singapore have not yet arrived. The Dutch authorities only provide the injured with a small amount of medicine. Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian authorities are currently trying to rescue the overseas Chinese kidnapped by Indonesian troops and have organized four Chinese-Indonesian rescue teams. One of them went to work in the countryside on the 20th, and the other teams will also start working soon.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai's Death is Not Far Off</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] After Zhou Fohai was sentenced to death by the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, the entire case and the judgment have been sent to the Ministry of Justice for review.

<h3>Fabricated a Story of Escaping Danger by Plane, Tried to Deceive the Mayor of Tianjin, Unsuccessful, Li Mou Went to Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] Half a month after the crash of China Airlines Flight 121 in Qingdao, a rogue named Li Zhidong fabricated a story and tried to swindle here. Li claimed to be a student in the 14th class of the military academy and a nephew of Li Mingyang. He visited Mayor Du Jianshi of the municipal government at 5:30 pm on the 20th and said that he was introduced by Chief Chen and intended to work in Tianjin. He came to Tianjin from Shanghai on China Airlines Flight 121, but unfortunately crashed in the sky over Qingdao. With his extraordinary wisdom, he climbed to the top of the toilet in the plane with both hands during the accident, avoiding the disaster. When Mayor Du asked about Chief Chen's letter of introduction, Li said that his property was completely destroyed due to the plane burning, and the letter of introduction was also among them. Mayor Du thought that Li's words were full of loopholes, so he told him that there were no vacancies in the police station here. Li saw that his plan was unsuccessful, and then asked to borrow money, saying that his travel expenses were also lost, so that he could go to Beiping to find a job, which was also rejected by Mayor Du. Li left in disappointment. When he stepped out of the city government hall, it happened that the field reporters of various newspapers came to the city government to interview the news of the day. Li took the opportunity to introduce himself and told the story of his encounter with danger and escape, and said that he lived in the Huizhong Hotel and his home was on Fulili Road in Shanghai, and that he had served as the commander of the 96th Army. The reporters thought that Li's description was vivid, and they all published it. The next day, they went to the Huizhong Hotel to visit again, and found out that there was no such person. After inquiring at the city government, they learned the truth. Li has now gone to Beiping. It is difficult to imagine whether he will use his old trick to swindle.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The United States Should Adopt a Bipartisan China Policy</h3>
<p>Upon returning to Washington, D.C., on the morning of the 21st, the new U.S. Secretary of State, General of the Army George C. Marshall, was immediately sworn in at the White House as the 48th U.S. Secretary of State. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, he went to the State Department to take charge, embarking on the unfinished task of striving for world peace as envisioned by his predecessor, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. From this point forward, a new chapter in the history of American diplomacy will unfold. Secretary of State Marshall, upon his return to Washington, D.C., made a brief statement: "I assume the position of Secretary of State without any political coloration; I shall restrain myself accordingly. Now and here is the best opportunity to put an end to any speculation about my future political activities. I will absolutely not get involved in the political vortex, nor can I be considered a candidate for any political office." General Marshall's statement still retained the essence of a military man. The appointment of a general as U.S. Secretary of State, initiated with General Marshall, has the major characteristic of transcending party lines and promoting a nationally unified foreign policy. In the current state of the United States, a Secretary of State who is detached from party affiliations and who adopts a joint foreign policy of both the Republican and Democratic parties is particularly necessary.</p>
<p>The foreign policy adopted by former Secretary of State Byrnes during his tenure received the unanimous support of both the Democratic and Republican parties, and can be regarded as a joint and consistent foreign policy of both parties. When Byrnes and Wallace had a dispute over foreign policy, although it caused a great uproar in political circles, Byrnes's position and reputation in the country remained unshaken because he was able to obtain the joint and unanimous support of both parties. On the contrary, Wallace had to resign as Secretary of Commerce and leave the Truman administration. However, when we examine the foreign policy adopted by Byrnes, the opinions of both parties were completely consistent on the European front, but on the Far East front, especially on the China policy, although there were no major differences in principle between the Democratic and Republican parties, there were still considerable differences. This distance is urgently needed to be eliminated in the current US government. General Marshall's promotion from Special Envoy to China to Secretary of State, his sole task is to synthesize the opinions of the Democratic and Republican parties and forge a joint and consistent Far East policy for the two parties of the United States. Therefore, it is known that General Marshall attaches importance to the China problem when he discussed the China problem with President Truman for the first time after taking office.</p>
<p>According to political observers, the US State Department is currently facing several pressing issues, including the following five: (1) The deterioration of US-Poland relations due to the Polish general election issue; (2) How to improve US-Soviet relations at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held on March 10; (3) Solving the Argentina problem, as well as the entire Latin American problem; (4) Changes in the internal personnel of the State Department; (5) China issue, General Marshall intends to make a statement in the shortest possible time to clarify his statement when he left China. These are all pressing issues that need to be resolved quickly by the new Secretary of State, but the fact that General Marshall and President Truman discussed the China issue during their first meeting shows that General Marshall and President Truman attach particular importance to the China issue. Although the content of the meeting has not been officially released, outsiders cannot know it, but we can also guess its general idea.</p>
<p>At present, the vision of the Chinese and American peoples is completely concentrated in Washington, D.C., and everyone is watching whether the US government is still hesitant to provide material assistance to China's nation-building and revival. Taking the US loan of 500 million US dollars to China for nation-building and revival as an example, the US Export-Import Bank had already reserved funds ten months ago, but when General Marshall was mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China, in order to promote a peaceful resolution of the internal conflict in China, he telegraphed the Export-Import Bank to retain this loan, which must be granted to the Chinese government only after domestic peace in China is realized, so that this loan is still in the vault of the US Export-Import Bank. However, the merits and demerits of this policy need to be reconsidered by General Marshall. Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican senator, delivered a speech on the 11th, advocating that the United States should change its China policy, encourage political organizations other than the Chinese Communist Party to form a coalition government, and said that the United States should "encourage those who are extremely brave and dedicated to unification, and prevent those who harm unification." The distance between the US Republican Party and the government's China policy lies here. If General Marshall wants to shorten the distance between the two parties on the China issue after taking office as Secretary of State, he should pay special attention to Vandenberg's speech on the 11th.</p>
<p>In short, after General Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, his view on the China issue should no longer be in the position of mediator, haggling over fairness, but should start from a broad perspective, taking into account the objective reality on the one hand, and respecting the opinions of the Republican Party on the other hand, to formulate a joint China policy for the two parties. China must not disregard its nation-building and revival plan because the CCP refuses to abandon its attempt to seize power by force, and similarly, the United States cannot stop its aid to China plan because the CCP obstructs China's unification. The Chinese government has drafted a five-year economic recovery plan, similar to the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, the purpose of which is to lay a solid foundation for China's industrialization. The United States should morally assist this plan, and the previously agreed loan of 500 million US dollars should be quickly granted to China, so as to help the early success of China's nation-building and revival.</p>

This causes the downstream flow of the Huai River to be obstructed at Tujiayao (half a li from Zhengyangguan), forcing it to turn northeast and flow into the Huai River at Lujiakou (fifteen li from Zhengyangguan). As a result, the Zheng-Mo shipping route is detoured by forty li. The water level between Tujiayao and Lujiakou is too shallow, allowing only light sailboats to navigate. Small steamers from Bengbu to Zhengzhou cannot reach directly and can only anchor at Huhezhi, across from Mohekou. Consequently, passengers traveling to Bengbu must cross the river from the steamer pier to Qianyao and then walk two li to board the steamer. The roadbed in this section, which is exposed only after the water recedes, is made of stone chips and crushed grass. The road is dangerous, and great care must be taken to avoid drowning. It is even more difficult to traverse during rainy seasons, and the loading and unloading of goods is greatly inconvenienced. Mudtang Lake, Tangjia Lake, and Mengjia Lake in the middle reaches of the Huai River, which originally stored water, are unable to discharge their contents, leaving over one million hectares of farmland uncultivable. Nine out of ten farming families are impoverished, creating a desolate scene. People from all walks of life in this city eagerly hope that the Huai River Guidance Committee will dredge the riverbed as soon as possible to facilitate navigation and smooth the flow of water. It has recently been learned that, to overcome the current difficulties, the city's Chamber of Commerce has discussed dredging the Huai River with Zhu Jiadong, chief engineer of the third section works office of the Huai River Embankment Restoration Project under the Huai River Guidance Committee. According to reports, the siltation of the Huai River spans two li and is estimated to require 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork, costing approximately 30 million National Currency. A request has been submitted to the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for approval. Once approved, work will begin to dredge the river.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to a person from Tianjia'an, a brain congestion epidemic has recently been discovered in the mining area of the Huainan Mining and Railway Bureau. As many as five or six people have died from the disease. The situation is extremely tragic, and there is no way to provide immediate assistance. The mine authorities are currently devising ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Loan Methods and Procedures in the Recovered Areas of Huaihai Both Need Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] According to a gentleman who recently returned from a disaster investigation in Liansi Baoshu: In most rural areas of the recovered Huaihai region, only small copper coins are still in circulation. This clearly indicates that farmers in these areas lack the means to exchange agricultural products for legal tender in the market, and their livelihoods are disconnected from the current monetary system. Although the government has approved the issuance of substantial interest-free agricultural loans, the methods and procedures for disbursing these loans must be improved. If these loans fall into the hands of a few powerful individuals, the government's good intentions will not reach the countryside.</p>

<h3>Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Discuss German Peace Treaty; Australian Representative States Opinions; France Submits Memorandum to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Advocating a Decentralized Federal System for Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] The Quadripartite Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference continued, with the Australian representative, Hodgkinson, stating his views on the German peace treaty. He said that Germany's new borders, including its eastern border with Poland, should not be regarded as already determined. The Australian government believes that Germany's borders must be decided by a plenary meeting of the Allied powers. The need for a responsible German authority to sign the German peace treaty is certain, but the five powers should not prematurely establish a central government in Germany solely for this purpose. The best solution at present is to establish a "transitional agreement" signed only by the Allied powers, and then transform it into a German peace treaty, on which Germany should also sign. The agreement should be decided by a meeting of all Allied powers. All committees sent to Germany or established in Germany should also be composed of representatives of all Allied powers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The French government has submitted a memorandum to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, proposing the abolition of the German parliament and the restoration of the pre-Bismarck political system, with a decentralized federation composed of more independent states. Although the memorandum has not yet been published, its contents are known to include the following key points: (1) Germany should be a federation, with the main powers belonging to the states, and the functions of the federal government limited to finance, food, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and some economic and diplomatic affairs. (2) The parliament of each state shall elect representatives every four years to form a federal council. (3) The Federal Council shall appoint a federal president annually, who shall appoint a government responsible for the first item. (4) The state governments shall be responsible for matters other than the first item, and may establish their own police, appoint judges of the Supreme Court, appoint ambassadors to foreign countries, and conduct negotiations with foreign countries, but may not merge with foreign countries or enter into alliances. (5) International treaties concluded with Germany must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Federal Council.</p>
<h3>Major Changes in U.S. Naval Leadership</h3>

<h3>Southern Country Makes Demands to Restrict Austrian Troops, Causing Repercussions in Austria</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Yugoslav representative, Vilfan, recently stated at the Quadripartite Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference the opinions of the Yugoslav government regarding the Austrian peace treaty, saying that all Austrian equipment used in the war should be destroyed and that all consequences of the German-Austrian merger should be cleared up. Austria's history has always been one of enslaving the Slavic people, and the last great war was caused by Austria, so its responsibility should be borne by the Austrians. Yugoslavia is most concerned about preventing Austrian Pan-Germanism, so it should severely limit the number of Austrian troops and completely eliminate its Nazi remnants. Vilfan then mentioned the request of the Southern Country to acquire the provinces of Carinthia and Styria, stating that the vast majority of the residents of these two provinces are Slavic and that incorporating them into the Southern Country can prevent Austria from once again controlling the fate of the Slavic people. Finally, he expressed the hope that the Allied powers would rebuild Austria in accordance with democratic principles, racial conditions, political needs, and moral principles.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] An Austrian official spokesman expressed surprise at Yugoslavia's request to the Quadripartite Foreign Ministers Conference that Austria not be allowed to have troops. The spokesman pointed out that the treaties of former German vassal states also allowed them to retain a small number of troops. Austria never allied with Hitler's Germany and was the first country to be victimized by Germany. If it is not allowed to have troops, it will not be able to maintain Austria's freedom and independence.</p>
<h3>Poland Demands Confirmation of Expanded Western Territory Fact</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] The Polish delegation will submit a memorandum to the Quadripartite Foreign Ministers Conference next Monday, the main point of which is to recognize Poland's four borders in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. Regarding the future political status of Germany, Poland believes that it should be resolved in cooperation with the German people, under the principle of political unity, depending on the progress of Germany's democratic and peaceful reconstruction work. The memorandum also strongly argues that the principle of revenge should not be the basis for drafting the peace treaty, and that Germany's reconstruction and return to peace should be as a member of a rational and lasting international group.</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Treaty in Drafting; Negotiations Between the Two Countries to Begin Soon; Anglo-Soviet Treaty Still Valid</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 24th] The draft Anglo-French treaty is being drafted by the British Foreign Office to serve as a blueprint for discussions between the British government and France.</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 24th] British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons yesterday that former French Premier Blum had exchanged views extensively with the British government during his visit to Britain and reached agreements on a number of political and economic issues. In addition, it was decided that Britain and France would, in accordance with Article 52 of the United Nations Charter, immediately conclude a treaty after the establishment of the new French government to prevent Germany from rising again and to safeguard world peace. The British government does not intend to replace the Anglo-Soviet treaty with the Anglo-French treaty, because in fact a treaty between one country and an international organization cannot be replaced by another treaty. Moreover, the more alliances in the United Nations, the more beneficial it is to world peace. I hope that after the new French government is in place, both sides can begin negotiations on the alliance treaty.</p>

<h3>Courts Are Working Tirelessly; Procedures for Amnesty and Release of Prisoners Will Be Completed Within Days; Over a Thousand People Have Been Released from Prisons and Detention Centers in Recent Days</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Near the end of the lunar year, the courts are not taking a holiday and are busier than ever due to handling the procedures for amnesty and release of prisoners. According to Director Tian of the Sinan Road Detention Center, on the 21st (the lunar New Year's Eve), the detention center worked all night to process the release of prisoners, releasing a total of 649 people in one day and night, including seven female prisoners.

<h3>Fire on Seymour Road Lasted 13 Hours; Residents' Discussions Varied, Warranting Attention</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 9:48 PM on the 22nd of this month (the first night of the lunar new year), a fire broke out at Wuding Road, Shaanxi North Road (i.e., Seymour Road), destroying a total of 13 structures and causing losses of over 2 billion yuan. The fire burned for 13 hours, which is unprecedented since the victory. Fortunately, no one was injured.</p>
<p>The fire started</p>
<p>in the 平房 house of a coppersmith at 425 Wuding Road. The cause of the fire is said to be an electrical short in the radio. At the time, the male owner of the shop was not home, and the female owner was flustered and did not take any rescue measures, but fled in a hurry, causing the fire to become uncontrollable. A row of 12 市房 houses at 660 Alley, Shaanxi North Road, including the Wuding Road Municipal National Central Elementary School, were all three-story buildings built five years before the founding of the Republic of China. The roofs were all constructed with lead sheets and wooden boards, with large gaps between the roof and the flat top, and they were connected to each other without firewalls. When the fire spread along the wind, the fire quickly spread like a mushroom cloud during an atomic bomb explosion. Although the fire brigade arrived to extinguish the fire, the fire was brewing in the interlayer. It was originally planned to split the lead sheet on the roof with an ax to let the fire pass through the roof, but the lead sheet was strong and tightly fastened, and the result was in vain. By about 3:00 AM on the 23rd, all the houses were surrounded by raging fire, and the strong wind helped the flames spread, with sparks flying everywhere, making the fire personnel who arrived on the scene helpless. After 10:00 AM, the fire gradually subsided, and they concentrated on extinguishing the fire, which was extinguished at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Afterwards,</p>
<p>reporters went to the fire site for inspection. In addition to the complete destruction of 425 Wuding Road where the fire started, the Yongqin Rubber Factory and the Shunkang Timber Company next door were also slightly affected, with minor losses. Houses at 29, 27, 25, 23, 21, 17, and 15 in Alley 66 next door were mostly destroyed, and houses at 13, 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1 were less damaged. Among them, 23 and 21 were the Municipal National Central Elementary School, and only the gatehouse on both sides was still intact, and the internal school equipment was completely destroyed. When the fire broke out, more than a dozen teachers and staff living in the school only managed to grab a few clothes and bedding, and the rest were turned to ashes. They had to temporarily stay in the nearby News Road Municipal Elementary School. Director of Education Gu Yuxiu had sent someone to express condolences and send 2 million yuan in relief money the day before.</p>
<p>The house at 29 was the residence of Wang Yunfu, manager of the Sanyou Industrial Company in this city, and there was a pig bristle workshop run by his eldest son. After the fire was extinguished, when inventorying the stored items, it was discovered that the safe had been pried open by others, and the gold bars and some 500 yuan in cosmetic and dressing bonds stored inside were missing.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>nearby residents were talking a lot, and it was rumored that before the fire was extinguished, there had been requests for gold bars and talk of "jin tou" (a slang term for bribery). Everyone expressed extreme indignation at this. Before the facts are proven, we should not judge prematurely. However, there is no smoke without fire. Since there is such a rumor, the municipal authorities should thoroughly investigate the matter. Logically speaking, Shanghai has excellent fire-fighting equipment such as tap water and fire trucks, but it could not be quickly extinguished and allowed to burn for as long as 13 hours. The reason is really difficult to understand. We will not talk about the truth of this matter for the time being, but from the people's standpoint, we hope that the authorities will pay close attention in the future and hope that the fire-fighting administration will be strengthened, so as not to disappoint the city's 5 million citizens in the municipal measures.</p>
<h3>Amateur Radio Association to Hold Regular Social Gathering</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Amateur Radio Association will hold its 36th annual social gathering at 6:00 PM on February 8th at the 星五 restaurant, No. 450 Nanjing Road. All members and their families are welcome to attend. Reservations can be made at No. 323 Jiangxi Road or No. 846 Zhongzheng Middle Road, the Asia-America Company, starting from January 29th. There are also gifts from the Jile Film Company.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Made Winter Clothing and Gave to University Students; Second Batch to Be Distributed Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Student Relief Committee, organized by the YMCA, will distribute the second batch of relief winter clothing donated by the Executive Yuan today. The winter clothing is made of black cloth on the outside, lined with washed white flour sacks, and filled with a large amount of cotton. All the raw materials are supplied by the China Textile Corporation. The sizes are all uniform, with only differences between men's and women's styles. The men's style is a short cotton jacket and pants, and the women's style is an ordinary-style cheongsam. The target of relief is only university students in this city who have poor family backgrounds. According to the person in charge there, registrations have been very enthusiastic, and most of them are university students who have returned to Shanghai from the interior. They were very awkward when they first wore the same style and color of winter clothing, but after a long time, more students wore them, and the weather was very cold, and there was a real need for them, so the feeling of embarrassment no longer existed. It is heard that more than a thousand people have registered, and the first batch has more than 500 sets of winter clothing, and the second batch will be distributed starting today, but the number is only more than 100 sets, which is still "more monks than congee."</p>
<h3>To Prevent Smallpox Epidemic, Compulsory Vaccination Is to Be Held; The General Organization Is to Be Hosted by the Epidemic Prevention Committee; A Promotion Association Is to Be Established Before February 1</h3>
<p>The number of smallpox patients in this city has been increasing recently. There were 20 people in the first ten days of January and 58 people in the middle ten days, for a total of 78 people, which is more than in the previous months, and there is a tendency for an epidemic. The Municipal Health Bureau, according to the decision of the First Municipal Council, will implement compulsory vaccination starting from February 1 to prevent the recurrence of smallpox in this year. The Health Bureau has decided that the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee will be the general organization for hosting vaccination, and will unite with all sectors to establish compulsory vaccination promotion associations in each administrative autonomous region before February 1. Vaccination general teams will be established throughout the city, and vaccination brigades and three-person teams (with a minimum of 400 teams) will be established in each district promotion association to be responsible for publicity, vaccination, and inspection in their respective districts. In addition, all public and private medical institutions and practicing physicians in the city are requested to set up 500 fixed vaccination stations to vaccinate with cowpox. It is planned to formally establish all the above teams and stations on February 8. Regarding the promotion of vaccination, the Health Bureau has also formulated measures: (1) The spring vaccination will use February 1 to 9 as the publicity date, using slogans, notices, newspaper advertisements, movies, and lectures to arouse public attention. February 9 to 28 will be the first phase of total mobilization, adopting a persuasive approach. Vaccination certificates will be issued by the Health Bureau after vaccination. March 1 to April 30 will be the second phase of total mobilization, forcibly implementing vaccination certificates, and conducting a general inspection of spring vaccination certificates for land and water transportation and all citizens of the city. (2) The autumn vaccination will use September 16 to 20 as the publicity date, September 21 to October 31 as the first phase of total mobilization, and November 1 to November 30 as the second phase of total mobilization. All vaccination methods are the same as in spring. (3) The Municipal Government will order all public and private schools, nurseries, shelters, prisons, factories, and various industrial and commercial groups in the city to vaccinate within a time limit. (4) The Municipal Government will order all hospitals, industrial physicians, and midwives in the city to implement vaccination for newborns. It is heard that the above vaccination funds have been submitted by the Health Bureau to the Municipal Government and will be allocated to the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee in installments from the epidemic prevention funds for use according to the budget. The Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee is scheduled to invite relevant agencies in the city to hold a meeting at the YMCA in Bāxiānqiáo at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the implementation of compulsory vaccination.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Rewarded by the Mayor for Meritorious Service in Maintaining Public Security</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The volunteer police in this city were commended by Police Director Xuan Tiewu yesterday for their outstanding contributions in assisting the regular police in this city in maintaining public security during the lunar new year period. Volunteer police who have captured thieves will each be credited with one merit.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the police bureau yesterday, the public security achievements in this city have broken the public security record of the Beijing-Shanghai area in previous years. Since the implementation of intensified winter prevention by the police bureau at the end of the old lunar year, theft cases have been almost extinct to this day.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Mayor Wu allocated 20 million yuan on the lunar New Year's Eve to reward the capable police officers who performed well during the winter prevention period, and ordered the police bureau to send people to comfort the families of the police officers who were injured or killed in the line of duty last year. The funds have been processed and distributed separately by the Garrison Bureau.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zukang and Others Inspect the Road Surface along the Bund in the Nanshi District</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to smooth traffic in the Nanshi District, inspected the road surface on the Bund from Jiuda Wharf to 董家渡 Wharf (i.e., Dachu Grain Depot Wharf) on the afternoon of the lunar New Year's Eve (January 21) together with Hou Yeqing, Liu Runan, Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Structural Department of the Bureau, and Wu Wenhua, Director of the Second Department. The area has been closed for a long time, and traffic is extremely inconvenient. It is heard that the Bureau of Public Works will actively repair it in the shortest possible time, and it will be officially opened to reduce traffic congestion in the inner road area and facilitate the berthing and unloading of merchant ships.</p>
<h3>Handguns from Overseas Sold for Profit; Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhabei Police Sub-bureau received a tip-off at about 8:25 PM on the 15th, stating that someone was hiding firearms at No. 80, Alley 70, Yutong Road. Section Chief Wang Shou led officers Yang Heping and Pan Shixian to the address and seized an American-made revolver with the number 133369 and one bullet inside in the straw pile of Gu Zhitang's home in Funing. He was taken to the sub-bureau for investigation. On the morning of the 19th, the sub-bureau received another report and arrested Gu Wenkui, a citizen of this city, who was selling firearms at No. 13, Panjiawan, Dayangqiao, and seized a Japanese-style handgun in his residence. Li Yousheng was arrested at No. 503, Wangjiazhai, and 96 bullets for a 303 rifle were found. During interrogation, it was confessed that both of them worked as night watchmen at the Great British Ship Company on the Bund, and the guns and ammunition were brought in by foreign sailors from overseas because the price was low, and they invested in them with the intention of reselling them.</p>
<h3>Barber's Love Triangle; Stabbed Four Times While Sound Asleep</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 3:00 AM yesterday, barber Dai Hengchang, 33, from Yangzhou, at the Chunfeng Barber Shop, No. 706, the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Yunnan Road, was suddenly broken into by a murderer while he was sound asleep, who stabbed him four times in the arms and face with a knife. The blood gushed out like a spring, and the murderer fled immediately. The injured Dai Hengchang was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment by his colleagues. After reporting to the Laozha Sub-bureau to send police to investigate, it was learned that it was a love triangle dispute. It turns out that there is a female hostess, Yang Guiying, in the shop who is somewhat attractive, and Dai is particularly fond of her. After being together for a long time, love sprouted, causing jealousy from a third party, resulting in this tragedy.</p>
<h3>Purchased a Place for Allied Guests to Rest</h3>
<p>The house at No. 1235, Route Pétain, has recently been purchased by the government as a permanent address for receiving foreign guests. In the future, Allied guests coming to Shanghai will use this house as a temporary resting place. The house has now been renovated, and the first guest to be received by China will be General Egerton, the head of the UNRRA office in Shanghai. The previous rumor that UNRRA had purchased a new residence for General Egerton has been officially denied by the UNRRA spokesperson. It is said that "UNRRA originally planned to find a residence for General Egerton, but the authorities stated that relief funds could not be used for other purposes, so the Central Trust of China purchased a property to temporarily lend to UNRRA to receive General Egerton. The house is like Blair House in Washington, D.C., and any Allied guests received by the government will temporarily reside there. It is actually a permanent reception center for the government, and General Egerton is only staying there temporarily."</p>

<h3>Spies and Robbers Almost Caused Trouble; Police Officers on Zhejiang Road Pursued and Opened Fire; It Was Learned that the Dispute Arose from Gambling over Money</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 9:00 PM on the 21st, the staff of the Tianhe Dyeing Factory at No. 38, North Zhejiang Road, were gathering in the shop to gamble on pai gow. Wu Xuequn and two unknown people went to participate. About half an hour later, Sun Shengdong had already lost more than 300,000 in cash and owed 230,000, so he went upstairs to get money to continue gambling. One of the gamblers, Fu Zhiliang, complained that the people they brought might be fraudulent (i.e., what is called a "Langzhong" trick). Not long after Sun Shengdong took the money down, Wu Xuequn and others met a sentry police officer on the bridge and pointed out that the people in front were robbers. The sentry police officer immediately drew his gun and ordered Wu Xuequn to stop. Wu did not obey the order, but ran away with his hands in his pockets. The police officer fired a shot into the sky, but he still ignored it. The police officer then fired three shots, and one bullet grazed his finger. After taking him to the police station for interrogation, it was learned that Wu Xuequn would be charged with fraud, and Sun Shengdong and Fu Zhiliang would be charged with false accusation, and they would be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>How Many People Lost Their Integrity and Became Traitors? – Statistics on Trials of Hanjians – From October of the Year Before Last to Recently – Four Hundred and Three Convicted by the High Court</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] During the eight years of the national War of Resistance Against Japan, how many people fought loyally for the revival of the nation, and how many lost their integrity, flattered the enemy, and became traitors, acting out a historical farce? This was an unprecedented test. The hypocrisy usually hidden behind masks was ruthlessly revealed in the mirror of history. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to statistics from the High Procuratorate from January 1, 1946, to December 31, 1946, 853 cases were prosecuted against suspected Hanjians, 79 were not prosecuted, 138 were wanted, and 73 were transferred. Almost all the notorious big traitors and evil secret agents in Shanghai's past could not escape the sanctions of national law. To give readers a complete picture, the reporter has compiled the High Court's verdicts on Hanjians that have been published in the newspaper.

<h3>Unprecedented Feat in Civil Aviation History – Giant Plane "Nanjing" Flies Across the Pacific – Arrived at Midway Island Yesterday and Flew to San Francisco – Inspecting and Planning Sino-U.S. Air Route Along the Way</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the Sino-U.S. aviation agreement, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has been actively preparing to open the Sino-U.S. air route. The company dispatched a special plane with more than 20 of its technical personnel from Jiangwan Airport at 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday to test the flight to the United States. This is the first Chinese civil aviation plane to fly to the United States in history and the first flight to the United States in the 18 years since the establishment of CNAC. The plane is a four-engine DC-4 giant plane, named "Nanjing," with the international identifier XPP02. It took off from Shanghai at 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Guam at 1:15 p.m. that afternoon. It then left Guam at 8:56 p.m. that night, flying via Wake Island to Midway Island. CNAC received a telegram yesterday stating that the plane did not land or stay at Wake Island and flew directly to Midway Island, arriving at 12:45 p.m. yesterday. It is scheduled to fly to Honolulu today and is expected to arrive in San Francisco on the 27th or 28th. It is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai on the 7th or 8th of next month. The plane also carried some mail on this trip. According to Mr. Wu, the person in charge of the company, the mission of the "Nanjing" flight to the United States is to investigate the stations, meteorology, repair equipment, and other facilities along the Sino-U.S. air route to prepare for the opening of the Sino-U.S. route by Chinese civil aviation planes. Mr. Wu also said that Chinese civil aviation planes are gradually expanding abroad. On August 26 last year, a CNAC plane made its first transoceanic flight to Manila. On September 28 of the same year, it flew to Tokyo, becoming the first Chinese civil aviation plane to fly to Japan in history. On January 23 of this year, there was another first in history with this civil aviation plane flying to the United States. After this plane returns to China, the Sino-U.S. air route will be officially opened.</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand Passengers Rescued from Zhijiang Steamer</h3>
<p>The circumstances of the sinking of the Zhijiang steamer off the coast of Wusong have been reported in previous newspapers. Regarding the exact number of passengers and crew members rescued from the ship, according to a report from the Wusong Branch of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department, 773 people were rescued by the department, and 46 were rescued by Chinese naval warships, all of whom were taken back to Shanghai. In addition, more than 100 people rescued by six pig-exporting boats have already left the country with the sailing ships. According to the Port Police Department, fortunately, the rescue was carried out early after the ship's accident, so the number of casualties was not as high as rumored.</p>
<p>[Another Report] When the Zhijiang steamer sank off the coast of Wusong, the Zhongquan warship was conducting exercises in the area. Upon hearing the news, it immediately dispatched a motorboat to provide assistance, rescuing many people. Most of those rescued voluntarily took a car to Shanghai without registering their names. The remaining sixty people and a small amount of luggage were assisted by the officers and soldiers of the warship to board the ship. They were provided with food and clothing and sailed into Gaochang Temple before disembarking on their own.</p>
<h3>Staff of Zhabei Police Department Donate Food Savings to Help Refugees</h3>
<p>Zhi Chun, the director of the Zhabei Police Department in this city, is very concerned about the refugees in this city. Recently, the city's Winter Relief Association organized shelters for the cold. He initiated a food-saving campaign among all police officers, raising 20 dan of rice. The China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs donated three buckets of soybean oil to the police department. All of these were sent to the shelters to provide food for the refugees, demonstrating admirable enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Stamp Campaign – Hoping for Continued Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched a stamp sales campaign in December of last year to make up for the funding shortage of the two hospitals run by the association. According to Huang Jiali, the secretary-general of the association, the campaign has received enthusiastic donations from various schools, institutions, banks, and businesses in the city. As of now, the donations received have reached more than 5 million national currency. However, this is still far from the association's original target of 10 million yuan. It is hoped that all sectors of the city will continue to donate generously. It is heard that the design of this year's anti-tuberculosis stamps has been decided to use the portrait of the association's late honorary secretary and hospital director, Dr. Hinder, an American. Dr. Hinder devoted himself to anti-tuberculosis work in Shanghai, pioneering the work with great effort. The association has given him this honor to commend his contributions.</p>
<h3>American Churches Donate Dairy Cows to China – More Than Seven Hundred Arrive in Shanghai – Including More Than Forty Newborn Calves – To Be Distributed to Schools and Hospitals</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The first batch of more than 700 dairy cows donated by American churches to China departed from New Orleans on the Atlantic coast of the United States on December 19 of last year on the S.S. Linderwood Victory. They crossed the Gulf of Mexico, passed through the Panama Canal, and traveled a long distance across the ocean, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year. Unloading began yesterday.</p>
<p>Unable to Bear the Homesickness</p>
<p>On the bank of the Qiujiang Wharf, this batch of "cows from a foreign land" stepped out of the crane and onto foreign soil for the first time. Most of them hesitated to move forward, as if they could not bear their "homesickness."</p>
<p>When the dairy cows boarded the ship in the United States, there were a total of 715 heads. During the journey, due to the tossing of the ocean and the influence of the tropical climate, 18 died of illness. Thirty-seven calves were born on the ship. After arriving in Shanghai, two more were born on the previous two days. Therefore, the actual number of cows landed in Shanghai was 697 (including 19 bulls) and 41 calves.</p>
<p>Approximately Six Gallons of Milk Per Day</p>
<p>It is reported that more than 90 of them unfortunately had miscarriages during the journey, otherwise, the number of "newborn calves" would be even greater. The appearance of these dairy cows is not as tall and strong as imagined, and they all have a sense of "weariness" after a long sea journey. According to the manager, the average milk production is six gallons per head per day, and the best can produce up to eight gallons, depending on the environment, climate, and proper feeding. Their average age is between one and three years. They are produced in various parts of the United States, and the market price is about US$160 per head. The freight is borne by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). It is estimated that the cost from the United States to Shanghai is more than US$200 per head.</p>
<p>More Large Batches Will Continue to Be Shipped to China</p>
<p>All the dairy cows are donated by the Church Service Committee, an organization of American churches. The initial initiator was the Baptist Church. Before the Second World War, during the Spanish Civil War, some church members witnessed the tragic situation of local people lacking food and nutrition in Spain. They were deeply moved and initiated fundraising for dairy cows after returning to the United States, but the work was terminated due to the outbreak of the war. After the war, this work was continued, and many cows have been donated to Poland, Italy, and other countries. A total of more than 2,000 heads will be donated to China and will be shipped in succession. The more than 700 heads that have arrived in Shanghai are currently being raised by the UNRRA Shanghai Animal Husbandry Station. They will be delivered to the recipient organizations in a week. The distribution quotas have been determined by the UNRRA authorities. The recipients are schools, hospitals, and other institutions related to the church, with the most going to the schools for the descendants of martyrs in the capital.</p>
<h3>The Telecommunications Bureau Uses the Spring Festival to Improve Long-Distance Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau is taking advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday to thoroughly test internal machines and lines and strive to improve long-distance telephones in order to reduce the "transmission attenuation" from the "carrier terminal" through the long-distance radio station to the households in western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the express long-distance telephone service, in addition to replacing the original Japanese carrier telephone machines between Beijing and Shanghai with American-style components, there are plans to install load coils on the "relay cables" at both ends of Beijing and Shanghai to improve the sound quality. In Shanghai, because of the connection with the equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has initiated weekly joint technical meetings with the Shanghai Telephone Company to discuss and cooperate in improving the system. It is reported that an agreement has been reached to adjust the equipment at the "Fujian Road Bureau" that is connected to the long-distance service and to add 15 pairs of long-distance relay lines. The Telecommunications Bureau will provide some of the materials required.</p>

<h3>Social Service – Continuous Rainy Weather and Severe Cold During the Spring Festival – This Newspaper Will Begin Distributing Winter Clothing from the 28th</h3>
<p>Hoping that Destitute, Unemployed, Elderly, Disabled, and Bereaved Children Will Receive Aid on Time</p>
<p>Continuous rainy weather and severe cold during the Spring Festival, with howling winds cutting to the bone. The general situation of the poor compatriots, struggling on the brink of starvation, lacking food and clothing, and having no shelter, is truly beyond description. After a long period of planning, the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has finally made the "Distribution of Winter Clothing" a reality. Although the small number of items is not enough to provide warmth to the vast number of hungry and cold masses, it is indeed unexpected good news for the poor compatriots who are eagerly awaiting it!</p>
<p>This distribution of winter clothing is limited to the destitute and unemployed who are truly in need, with priority given to the elderly, disabled, and bereaved children, so that these poor compatriots can receive comfort as soon as possible. The Shanghai Branch of UNRRA has entrusted various charitable organizations in this city to handle this distribution. This newspaper has been entrusted to distribute 400 pieces and will receive them within days. It is hereby announced that the distribution will begin on the 28th of this month, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon every day, at this office. Those who need this winter clothing should prepare a receipt, bring their identity card, household registration certificate, or other proof of identity, and come to the office to wait for their turn until all the clothing is distributed. However, those whose documents are inconsistent or have already received clothing elsewhere will not be given any.</p>
<h3>Speaking Out for the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick – Saving and Helping Others is a Great Merit</h3>
<p>Qingxia Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund Raising Donations</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, people of all ages and genders welcome a pleasant day with excitement and joy. In wealthy families, children put on new clothes, and their pockets are filled with candy. Adults feast on each other in lavish luxury, spending thousands of dollars in one go. But what about the poor? They are still struggling on the brink of starvation, unable to keep warm or eat their fill, at the mercy of fate. But can we watch them freeze and starve without feeling any compassion? No! Never! If we can save a little from the extravagance of the Spring Festival and use it to help them, it may bring them a lot of comfort! The Qingxia Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund, hosted by this column, is the best opportunity for us to give alms. Dear readers, please hurry up and donate!</p>
<h3>Wen Lanting's Condition Improves – Intestinal Cancer to Be Surgically Removed</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Wen Lanting, who is being treated at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, has improved slightly after several days of careful injections and treatment at the hospital, but his condition is still not out of danger. The hospital used X-rays on New Year's Eve and performed surgery on the same day to remove his intestinal pain. It is planned that after a dozen days of rest and recovery, a second operation will be performed. Wen's fever was 39 degrees Celsius yesterday, and his breathing was still rapid. With the hospital's permission, his family members are attending to him in the hospital.</p>
<h3>Greetings and Prosperity: Pedicab Drivers Quote Exorbitant Prices, Cars Are Chartered by Number</h3>
<p>A spring rain, drizzling softly, somewhat diminished the festive atmosphere of the New Year!</p>
<p>Looking back at the past year, despite economic instability, most industries managed to weather the storm, which some considered a stroke of great fortune.</p>
<p>Although the issue of year-end bonuses caused quite a stir, some industries brought joy to everyone and were seen with "new eyes." It is said that the director of Factory XX alone received a bonus of 120 million, and even ordinary technicians received over ten million. The China Textile Corporation was not too bad either, with all employees receiving an additional four months' salary. In addition, several paint companies made a substantial profit last year, so each employee's bonus was at least 30 million. This inevitably caused some "stimulation" among others in the industry.</p>
<p>It's the New Year, and everyone is indulging in the tradition of clasping their hands and bowing to each other, exclaiming, "Greetings and prosperity!"</p>
<p>On "New Year's Day," a tram ticket inspector met a conductor and, as usual, said, "Prosperity! Prosperity!"</p>
<p>The conductor seemed humorous, replying: "Making a fortune is not about selling tickets, or else I'd have to skim from the top!"</p>
<p>Visiting relatives is a major event during the Spring Festival, and car services did good business. With more people than cars, everyone lined up by number, and many only got a ride in the afternoon after registering in the morning.</p>
<p>Pedicabs also saw this opportunity and quoted exorbitant prices. They argued that it's a "new world for the New Year," and people don't care about the cost. It seems the drivers had an easy time making money, asking for tens of thousands at every turn. If our estimates are not too high, the average daily income of a pedicab driver should be at least 300,000.</p>
<p>Theaters also did brisk business, packed to the point of being "impenetrable." To cater to the general audience's tastes, film companies brought out "fair legs" and "jade arms" to attract attention. As a result, movies like "Splendid Paradise," "Jade Hall of Wealth," "Golden Horse Jade Hall," and "Nightly Spring Festival"... all appeared to meet the season. Everywhere showed a scene of "singing and dancing in peace"!</p>
<p>Here: There was also a good business in scalped tickets, with a single "flying ticket" selling for 8,000.</p>
<p>At least it can be said that "New Year's Day" was generally peaceful. The District Court only received one case from the police station on "New Year's Day," perhaps because everyone was busy celebrating the New Year?</p>
<p>As the New Year begins, all things are renewed. We will say few discouraging words, as "the past is gone!" The whole year's plan lies in the spring. May everyone welcome a good God of Wealth tonight and have a year of "universal peace"!</p>
<p>Finally: We greet this "Year of the Pig" with great excitement, hoping that pork prices can lead all industries and that all prices will trend downward! Then our country and our people will be fortunate! May pork prices lead all industries and that all prices will trend downward! Then our country and our people will be fortunate! Fortunate!</p>
<p>Pig! We hope you lead all industry prices on a downward path</p>

<h3>Central Bank's Selling Pressure: Gold Prices Repeatedly Rise and Fall; Stocks and Currency Eager to Rise; Rumor of Large Shipment of Gold Arriving</h3>
<p>Gold prices were extremely chaotic during the holiday break. On January 21 (Lunar New Year's Eve), the fluctuations were the greatest, initially ranging from 4.13 million to 4.15 million, but then the Central Bank stepped in to suppress it, gradually lowering the price. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 580 bars at a price of 3.299 million, breaking the 4 million mark. Subsequently, in addition to open allocation, the Central Bank vigorously sold at market prices such as 4.01 million, 4 million, and 3.96 million, with extremely smooth sales and eager buyers. Therefore, although the price briefly fell to around 3.94 million, it still rebounded above 4 million by noon. In the afternoon, after the Central Bank's control measures ceased, sales remained strong, and soon the price exceeded 4.1 million. There were still transactions after 5 p.m., with market prices already shouted up to over 4.2 million, and there was a transaction at 4.3 million in the evening. On January 23, except for dealers of allocated gold, most companies did not open for business, with the off-market price initially quoted at 4.25 million to 4.3 million. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 500 bars at a price of 3.93 million, and the final quoted price was reduced to 4.05 million. The two major central banks openly and secretly sold over 10,000 bars. The black market exchange rate for US dollars was between 6,800 and 7,100, and the Hong Kong dollar stood at around 1,400 yuan.</p>
<p>On January 23, Chinese stocks opened on a positive note, with all stocks opening higher. However, as the Central Bank allocated gold at lower prices, sentiment softened and prices retreated. Nevertheless, small-cap stocks showed promise, and as a result, compared to before the market closed for the holiday, Wing On Silk, King Fook, Chun Hing, and Wah Fung all rose slightly, while Mayer fell by half a percent, and Sincere and Sun Kwong suffered slight losses. Cold stocks all saw slight increases. In forward trading, Wing On Silk, Sun Kwong, and Sincere slightly decreased, while Chun Hing and Wah Fung slightly increased, and Mayer fell back by half a percent.</p>
<p>On January 24, a small number of gold shops resumed operations yesterday, making market prices and transactions more active than the previous day. The market opened at 4.03 million to 4.06 million, but buyers were wary due to allocation concerns and retreated to within 4 million. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated another 1,470 bars at a price of 3.93 million, at which point the price briefly fell to 3.95 million. Subsequently, selling pressure eased, buyers were also eager, and the price rebounded above 4 million. At noon, the price rose to 4.1 million, and the silver shops of gold industry members increased the price of decorative gold from 420,000 to 424,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of trading for Chinese stocks after the New Year, and trading volume remained low. After 11 a.m., trading became even quieter. The market opened lower, as the Central Bank reduced prices for allocation and rumors circulated of a large shipment of gold arriving, causing fear. Sellers continued to be eager after the opening, and suppliers of forward Wing On Silk from numbers 224, 110, 31, and 158 lowered the price to 785 yuan. Number 35 bought spot Wing On Silk on the dips, and numbers 198 and 231 also entered the market, but because number 89 and others were still selling, they struggled slightly. However, off-market prices continued to rise, and gold prices also rebounded. Numbers 156, 169, 180, and 223 all entered the market. Near noon, forward Wing On Silk rebounded to 807 yuan before leveling off. The noon closing showed the same price for forward trading. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Wing On Silk, Sun Kwong, and Chun Hing slightly increased, Mayer and Wah Fung slightly decreased, and King Fook remained the same. In forward trading, Wing On Silk and Sincere slightly decreased, Mayer, Chun Hing, and Wah Fung slightly increased, and Sun Kwong remained the same. Trading in cold stocks was sparse and slightly decreased.</p>
<h3>Production Loans: Over 60 Billion Loaned Out; Inspection Team Established to Strengthen Audits</h3>
<p>The Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans of the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (J.R.R.A.) has been working in Shanghai for over a month. With the assistance of government and national financial institution officials, as well as financial, industrial, and commercial leaders, and mining experts, the committee has provided appropriate funding to all types of enterprises that are continuing production and urgently need low-interest loan assistance, while commercial enterprises such as transportation and sales have not been handled. Production enterprises have already been loaned to over 300 households, with a loan amount of over 60 billion yuan. This government measure has provided considerable assistance to industry, mining, and general business operations, and the production sector in Shanghai has benefited greatly. Furthermore, in order to ensure that manufacturers who have already received loans can effectively use the loaned funds to increase production, the office has established an inspection team to strengthen audits, in order to fulfill the government's original intention of organizing this production loan.</p>
<h3>China Textile Corporation to Resume Yarn Sales on Monday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Although the China Textile Construction Company resumed operations yesterday due to the Lunar New Year, it did not open for yarn sales as usual. It has now been decided to resume yarn sales next Monday.</p>
<p>In addition, the first batch of 150 tons of Shaanxi cotton ordered by the company arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that a total of 1,500 tons will arrive in Shanghai. The price of each dan (unit of weight) of cotton delivered to Shanghai is legally 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, which can be used to spin approximately 42-count cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Committee to Hold Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The 21st regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was originally scheduled to be held this Thursday. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, it has now been postponed to 10 a.m. today at the City Hall conference room, where discussions on the procurement of yarn and cloth will continue. It is reported that the six district cotton spinning associations have not yet filled out and submitted the notification forms for the first batch of yarn and cloth to be procured by the government. Therefore, after today's meeting, measures will be taken to expedite the progress of the work.</p>
<h3>Import Management Committee Intensifies Review and Issuance of Permits</h3>
<p>No Holiday for New Year</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Because of the heavy workload, the various departments of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee did not take a holiday during the Lunar New Year, and at the same time intensified the review and issuance of permits. It is reported that among the permits already issued, gasoline and fuel oil accounted for the most, followed by urgently needed materials such as sleepers, to meet urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Tea Mortgage Loans: Farmers Bank Loans Out 120 Billion Yuan; China Trust Bureau's Purchase Price Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>The tea mortgage loans organized by the Farmers Bank of China were originally divided into two types: self-funded and tea processing loans, with each type of mortgage loan quota set at 60 billion, totaling 120 billion. Currently, the entire amount of these mortgage loans has been loaned out, and tea from the self-made processing portion is still being delivered continuously. In order to support the tea industry, the bank has decided to continue handling the loans, and the mortgage loan quota may be 30 billion, which is currently being discussed with the Central Bank for re-pledging procedures. The tea mortgage loans handled by the bank this time were initially limited to four areas: Tunxi, Pingshui, Wenzhou, and Qimen, and then three areas in Hubei and Hunan, Ningzhou, and Fuzhou were added. Therefore, after repeated increases in the mortgage loan quota, it was still insufficient. There is no problem with the China Trust Bureau purchasing the above-mentioned mortgage tea, but the purchase price and tea grades still need to be discussed by all relevant parties before a final decision can be made.</p>
<h3>First Shipment of Japanese Raw Silk Can Arrive in England Within Two Weeks: 35 Shillings Per Pound</h3>
<p>[Reuter, London, 23rd] The Ministry of Trade announced today: The first shipment of Japanese silk to England since the Pearl Harbor incident will arrive within two weeks and will be sold to manufacturers at a price of 35 to 36 shillings per pound.</p>
<p>This shipment totals 160,000 pounds and is the first shipment of the 1,000,000 pounds of silk ordered from Japan this year.</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson: Most of this Japanese silk will be used by hosiery manufacturers, and one-third of the products will be exported abroad. The spokesperson also said: The United Kingdom has a treaty with the Allied Supreme Headquarters that the United Kingdom should receive 6% of the raw silk exported by Japan, but this provision will gradually expire, as private transactions have gradually resumed, but orders must go through the government, as privately run commercial firms cannot directly transact with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Production Equipment for Industry and Mining: Taiwan Province Coordinates Purchases</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen production capacity and improve people's lives, the Provincial Government has decided to make a comprehensive plan to enrich the production equipment of public mining factories and enterprises. It is reported that the relevant departments have separately notified all mining factories and companies to fill out detailed reports in the short term in order to coordinate the handling of the purchase of the above-mentioned equipment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Raw Silk Sales Are Sluggish; Cotton Goods Are More Optimistic: Observations of the US Army Authorities</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The US Army authorities are paying close attention to the export of Japanese silk and cotton goods. It is investigated that Japan's main imported goods are funded by these exported goods. Before the war, the United States bought seven-eighths of all silk goods exported by Japan, of which 90% were used to make silk stockings. However, officials believe that the popularity of nylon stockings (commonly known as glass stockings) will greatly reduce the sales of Japanese silk in the United States. Currently, Japan has 150,000 bales of raw silk available for export, and produces about 125,000 bales of raw silk annually. If all of this raw silk can be sold, it can reduce the cost of the occupying forces. However, the sales of Japanese raw silk are currently sluggish, with only 20,000 bales being sold, worth US$25 million. Therefore, the US military authorities are very concerned about the future of Japanese raw silk. However, they are more optimistic about Japanese cotton goods. Japan has obtained surplus raw cotton from the United States worth 150 million yuan, which is exchanged for Japanese cotton goods exports. According to the US military authorities currently responsible for Japan, this approach has four benefits: (1) It allows the Japanese to obtain employment; (2) It enables Japan to obtain the funds needed for major imports through exports; (3) It enables Japan to manufacture the cotton goods that the Far East urgently needs; (4) It enables Japan to make good use of the US government's surplus raw cotton.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Plans to Strengthen Operations: Handle Overseas Commercial Information Reporting</h3>
<p>The administrative operations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be strengthened and promoted, including factory registration, mining rights establishment, electrical business registration, and company registration, which will be actively launched simultaneously. It is reported that the following plan has been formulated: (1) Amend necessary laws and regulations, such as changing the original factory registration rules to factory registration regulations and establishing a factory permit system; (2) Add necessary institutions, such as restoring the supervision of exchanges in various places and adding overseas commercial attachés; (3) Strengthen administrative supervision, such as allowing provincial authorities to handle mining rights registration matters; (4) Strengthen close work linkages, such as contacting the Ministry of Finance to crack down on loans to factories not registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, consulting with the Ministry of Finance to strengthen the supervision of exchanges, contacting embassies and consulates abroad to handle overseas commercial information reporting work, and contacting chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places to handle factory registration and domestic market commercial information surveys, etc., which are being planned and implemented.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions: Explanation of Handling Process by the Currency Department</h3>
<p>Recently, your newspaper's editorial on the 11th of this month, "The Focus of Economic Issues," was deeply felt and highly admired. The responsible authorities have long paid attention to or are seeking and resolving the points raised. However, in the first paragraph (1) of the article, "The issue of the restoration of commercial banks and financial institutions," it stated: "The application deadline was extended to July 15, 1946, and there was no approval for further extension, but in fact, applications for resumption of business can still be accepted to this day." This is not consistent with the facts. After investigation, the deadline for commercial banks and financial institutions to apply for resumption of business was extended to July 15, 1946. The Ministry of Finance will absolutely not accept applications submitted after July 15. For those mailed in various places before July 15 and received by the Ministry of Finance after July 15, those with a postmark date confirmed to be before July 15 will be accepted, and the envelope will still be attached to the file for verification. The handling is extremely strict and cautious, and there is absolutely no fact of "still being accepted to this day." As for the continued processing of applications for the restoration of financial institutions (1) that were submitted to the Ministry before July 15 and require additional documents or investigation of documents; (2) financial institutions in the pacification areas that were unable to apply before July 15 due to factual limitations were specially stipulated by the Ministry to complete the application procedures within two months from the date of recovery. Therefore, the deadline of July 15 should be regarded as an exception in the pacification areas. The case files are all available and can be reviewed. In addition, among the various documents, those that require proof from the local city or county government and documents closely related to local finance are due to the fact that these financial institutions were not registered with the Ministry of Finance before the war, and there are no records to check. If they are not certified by the city and county governments, the Ministry of Finance will have no knowledge of the relationship between these financial institutions and the local area. This was the original intention of the legislation at the time and should be understood by the world. In short, the restoration of commercial banks and financial institutions is a heavy task in the post-war financial restoration. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly heard about the disputes arising from this and has paid great attention to and investigated them, and has discovered cases of forging documents and impersonating names to swindle, which have been sent to the court for investigation. If the responsible officials have demanded bribes, it is hoped that the public will report the facts, and the Ministry of Finance will punish them to the full extent of the law in order to purify officialdom and emphasize law and discipline. However, since the number of applications for the restoration of business reached more than 1,500, and not all of them could be approved, those who hold grudges are naturally numerous, and rumors are inevitable in this filthy society. This requires fair public opinion to make a choice and not make public officials who abide by the law too heartbroken.</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Newly Revised Central Bank Law</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>Article 2 of the Central Bank Law promulgated by the National Government on May 23rd, the 24th year of the Republic of China, stipulates four special privileges of the Central Bank: 1. Issuing convertible notes for standard currency and subsidiary currency; 2. Managing the government's standard currency; 3. Managing the national treasury; 4. Underwriting domestic and foreign debts.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Bank successively grasped the nationwide bill exchange, unified the issuance of legal tender, and managed foreign exchange and gold trading, which indeed had a tendency to become the "bank of banks."</p>
<p>Due to the evolution of this trend, it is heard that the Legislative Yuan has proposed the following eight special privileges for the Central Bank in the legislative principles of the Central Bank Law: 1. Issuing banknotes; 2. Acting as agent for the national treasury; 3. Managing public debts; 4. Buying and selling bullion; 5. Stabilizing international balance of payments; 6. Receiving designated portions of banks' legal reserve deposits; 7. Handling bill rediscounting; 8. Handling bill clearing.</p>
<p>These new legislative principles, judging from the development path of central banks in various countries over the past fifty years, and based on the evolution of our country's central bank over the past ten years, are still considered to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Since the Central Bank's business will be expanded so much in the future, and its powers will be increased so greatly, its relationship with national and public livelihood is no longer comparable to the past, especially its close relationship with commerce, industry, and the banking industry, where even a slight disturbance can have a significant impact.</p>
<p>Because the Central Bank has such a close relationship with the industrial and commercial circles, the central bank laws of some countries explicitly stipulate that members of the Executive Committee or Directors should be filled by people from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and banking industries. For example, Article 54 of the Belgian National Bank Law promulgated in 1927 stipulates that three of the nine members of the Executive Committee (i.e., Directors) are selected from candidates nominated by industrial and commercial associations, agricultural associations, and trade unions. The qualifications for the remaining Executive Committee members are prominent figures in the commercial, industrial, and banking sectors. Similarly, Article 33 of the Chilean Central Bank Law of 1925 stipulates that among the ten Directors, in addition to seven elected by shareholders, the remaining three are each selected by the National Chamber of Commerce, the National Agricultural Association, and the General Labour Union. Furthermore, according to Article 25 of the Estonian Bank Law of 1927, the election of Directors is nominated by commercial, industrial, agricultural, cooperative, and labour groups and submitted to the general assembly for election. The situation is similar in Britain and France.</p>
<p>Why are some of the Directors or Supervisors of the Central Bank nominated by economic organizations? The scholar Ke Xu (Kiech), who studied the central bank system of various countries, put it very well. He said: "The interrelationship between a country's economic organization and commercial conditions is extremely complex, and every move of the central bank is enough to have a significant impact on it. Taking the discount rate as an example, even a slight increase or decrease has different effects on industries and businesses, and the situations vary greatly. If the government completely controls the central bank, it will not only easily cause political problems, but also easily cause economic disputes. Therefore, the central bank should have a national perspective on "policy" and should not be completely controlled by officials on "control." Even if the capital belongs to the state, it should still be independent in administration."</p>
<p>Mr. Ke's words are indeed insightful. In the future, in order to manage and operate the Central Bank of our country properly, and in order to coordinate policies with the national economic situation, people from commerce, industry, agriculture, banking, and insurance industries should participate in the duties of Directors and Supervisors, so that it will forever become the "bank of banks" on the one hand, and truly become the "bank of the people of the whole country" on the other hand.</p>
<p>As for the method of economic organizations participating in the duties of Directors and Supervisors, from the perspective of legislative technique: either each economic organization can nominate several people by itself, or, according to the provisions of the old Central Bank Law, "the central government shall select a number of people from those who are actually engaged in commerce, industry, agriculture, and banking."</p>
<p>It is heard that the newly revised Central Bank Law stipulates that the source of capital is entirely borne by the national treasury, becoming state-owned and state-operated. If this becomes a reality in the future, it will not affect the opinions I have provided above. Because the capital provided by the national treasury is also borne by the people, and since it is borne by the people, representatives of various economic organizations should be given the opportunity to participate.</p>
<p>Based on the expansion of the Central Bank's powers in our country over the past ten years, as well as the established examples of the organization of central banks in various countries, I have briefly stated my opinions as above to express my heartfelt expectations.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Faces Financial Difficulties, Professors Owed Three Months' Salary, Student Union Cables Chief Zhu to Appeal</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The student union of National Jiaotong University recently sent a telegram to Minister Zhu Jiahua of the Ministry of Education, stating: "We have heard that education is a major plan for the country for a hundred years and the driving force for national construction. Therefore, Chairman Chiang repeatedly encouraged the people of the country with 'Education First.' However, to this day, Jiaotong University is facing an unreasonable contraction of funds, which is about to lead to a standstill. All students in the school are extremely heartbroken! Jiaotong University has a glorious history of fifty years, and the people of the country all cherish it. Although it has gone through many hardships, it has been able to thrive and grow and become a driving force for national construction. Looking back, although the country's finances were extremely difficult during the war, Jiaotong University was still able to maintain itself. Now, it is facing this unprecedented hardship at the beginning of peaceful national construction. Who will the Minister ask to be responsible for destroying education? We have heard that some professors at our school have been owed salaries for three months. The school has had to use high-interest loans to pay them, and the professors have to bear 50,000 yuan of interest per month. It is infuriating to say! Furthermore, the number of staff members is too small, and administrative efficiency is slow. Every semester, classes have to be delayed for two months before they can begin. Infinite time is wasted. Who will the Minister ask to be responsible for delaying the studies of three thousand students? In contrast, Peking University and Central University have three thousand students and more than one thousand faculty and staff members, and five thousand students and one thousand three hundred faculty and staff members, respectively. Now, Jiaotong University has more than three thousand two hundred students, but only four hundred faculty and staff members. Compared with them, we do not know what scale the Ministry of Education uses to calculate? Why are we treated so generously to them and so poorly to us? We cannot understand! The entire student body of our school is in a state of anger. We, as young people, will not be able to suppress our anger. If there is no satisfactory solution, the entire Jiaotong University will be in a state of turmoil and will continue to express itself. We hope that the Minister will consider it! We respectfully send this telegram and wish you peace."</p>

<h3>Principals of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in the City Issue Declaration on Protecting Education, Respond to Newspaper Criticism, and Reconsider School Fee Regulations</h3>
<p>Seven hundred principals of private primary and secondary schools in the city, including Shen Tongyi, Gao Erbai, Jia Guanren, Wang Zhensheng, Wang Weiqun, and Wang Shibin, have issued the following declaration to protect education:</p>
<p>"Since education in Shanghai began in the late Qing Dynasty, private schools have been established since the founding of the Republic of China, which has become a trend. Over the past thirty years, those who have made contributions to the country and those who have graduated from private schools have numbered more than ten times those from public schools. Private schools do have an urgent need for society, and the spirit of those who run private schools has never been absent. During the Shanghai War, education in Shanghai was severely suppressed. Public schools, due to the dangerous environment, closed down. Our colleagues in private schools supported the precarious situation in the midst of storms, corrected the thinking of young people, and cultivated awareness of resistance against Japan. Those who were unfortunately taken advantage of by the enemy and puppet regimes, fell into the water and fire, were humiliated, attacked, wounded, and murdered cannot be counted. Those who toiled day and night, ate simple food and drank plain water, felt cold in winter and hungry in times of plenty, still maintained their spirits and persevered in their original intentions are even more numerous. This is a common understanding of society. Therefore, a loan was initiated to express sympathy to the education sector. This situation is still vivid, and our colleagues in private schools will always be grateful and never forget it. Now that the country has been rebuilt and the sun has shone again, everyone is celebrating. Unexpectedly, over the past year, the cost of living has risen sharply, and our private schools have been operating under difficult conditions without getting a little rest. Instead of encouraging improvement in education, knowledgeable people have criticized the school fee income. Newspapers have reported on this repeatedly, causing a stir in society. Some even call us 'school shops' and accuse us of 'collecting money.' Our colleagues in private schools are at peace with our consciences and can only endure humiliation, bear insults, and quietly wait for the correct public opinion of society. The participants of the meeting have failed to understand the difficulties of running schools, have not considered the rising prices, and have not remembered the difficulty of struggling through the precarious situation of the past. Swayed by newspaper reports, they have imposed regulations on the fees charged by our private schools, making it impossible for education to develop due to financial difficulties, which is a worrying situation. Considering the feelings and reasoning, how could this be the original intention of the participants? Our colleagues were planning to actively rectify during this recovery period, carefully select teachers, enrich equipment, put young people on the right track, and make great achievements in the future. We cannot help but express our regret for this major misunderstanding. We also remember Chairman Chiang's words on 'Education First,' and we should continue to work hard and never slacken in order to live up to expectations. In order to maintain our integrity and protect education, we should not hesitate to make sacrifices and strive for it. We cannot remain silent about the rumours in the newspapers. As for the school fee regulations of the meeting, whether or not we should abide by them legally and whether the amount is appropriate for us will be decided by the general assembly. This is a special declaration."</p>
<h3>Far East U.S. Navy Basketball Tournament – Shanghai Team Wins Championship – Defeats Tianjin Team in Yesterday's Final</h3>
<p>The Far East U.S. Navy Basketball Championship, hosted by the Shanghai U.S. Navy District, commenced on the 17th of this month. Naval teams from Shanghai, Japan, Okinawa, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other locations participated in a five-day competition held at the city stadium. Ultimately, the Shanghai team emerged as the overall champion and will soon travel to Guam, Pearl Harbor, Great Lakes, Chicago, and other places to compete in the All-American U.S. Navy Basketball Championship. Details of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Defeats Okinawa: Starting from the 22nd, coinciding with the Lunar New Year holiday, newspapers were suspended, and the stadium was not bustling. At 2 PM, two matches took place. In the first match, the Shanghai team faced the Okinawa team. Okinawa took an early lead, reaching 14-5. However, Shanghai gradually found its rhythm, tying the score at 17-17. Then, the Shanghai team broke away, leading 22-20. Okinawa, not willing to concede, fought back and regained momentum. At the end of the first half, Shanghai trailed 28-33. After switching sides, the Shanghai team unleashed its power, aggressively closing the gap, causing Okinawa to falter. Ultimately, Shanghai won with a score of 60-57.</p>
<p>Tianjin Eliminates Japan: In the second match on Sunday, Tianjin played against Japan. After the initial engagement, the Japanese team took a lead of 15-11. The Tianjin team identified the opponent's weaknesses and changed its strategy, employing long-range shots with a high success rate, making nine out of ten attempts. By the end of the first half, Japan trailed 27-35. After the break, with the teams switching sides, Tianjin continued to lead due to its well-rounded players. The Japanese team tried to salvage the situation but ultimately lacked coordination. When the final buzzer sounded, they were eliminated by Tianjin with a score of 59-68.</p>
<p>Tianjin Further Defeats Qingdao: On the 23rd (second day of the Lunar New Year), at 3 PM, Qingdao competed against Tianjin. The audience was still small. Tianjin scored first, while Qingdao relied solely on free throws for points. Tianjin continued its efforts, accumulating points. At the end of the first half, Qingdao had 10 points, while Tianjin had 27 points. After switching sides, the two teams clashed again. Although the Qingdao team tried to rally, Tianjin's tight defense left no openings. Qingdao's defense was weak, and Tianjin was exceptionally rampant. In the end, Tianjin defeated Qingdao with a score of 62-31, securing the right to the final.</p>
<p>Shanghai Defeats Tianjin: On the 24th (yesterday), at 3 PM, the Shanghai team faced the Tianjin team in the final match for the Far East Championship. The match was held at the city stadium with a larger audience. Before the match, many predicted that Tianjin would win the championship, believing that Shanghai would inevitably lose. However, after the start, the Shanghai team played steadily and smoothly, while the Tianjin team appeared flustered and committed numerous fouls. At the end of the first half, the Shanghai team led 26-14. After switching sides, the Tianjin team briefly rallied, but soon the Shanghai team was able to do as it pleased. When the regulation time ended, the Shanghai team defeated the Tianjin team with a score of 47-41, and will soon fly to Guam for the expedition.</p>

<h3>The Author of the "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao"</h3>
<p>— Ye Dejun</p>
<p>Among the "Zhugongdiao" of the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties that have survived to the present, there are three types: one is the "Liu Zhiyuan Zhugongdiao," which contains the "Shang" and "Jiao" tunes that were no longer used in the teaching studios. This was likely created earlier and appears to be a work of the Song Dynasty. The second is the "Romance of the Western Chamber Zhugongdiao," written by Dong Jieyuan of the Jin Dynasty. The third is the "Anecdotes of Tianbao Zhugongdiao," written by Wang Bocheng of the Yuan Dynasty (with newly compiled editions). In addition, in the "Romance of the Western Chamber Zhugongdiao" and Yuan Shi Junbao's "Zhugongdiao" "Wind, Moon, Purple Clouds Court," which narrates the singing of Zhugongdiao, there are some Zhugongdiao titles, of which "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao" is one.</p>
<p>The story of the scholar Double Gradual and the courtesan Su Xiaoqing already existed in three or four types of Southern Drama and Yuan Zaju during the Song and Yuan dynasties. Dozens of sets of Yuan Dynasty Sanqu also narrate or involve it, making it a common allusion. The original story appears in Volume 7 of Mei Dingzuo's "Qingni Lotus Record" of the Ming Dynasty. Chapter 51 of the 120-chapter version of "Water Margin" recounts Bai Xiuying's performance of "Double Pursuit of Su Qing in Yuzhang City" at the hooker's place, which was a performance of this "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao." Although this Zhugongdiao has been lost and no longer exists, the author can still be researched, but commentators have not touched upon it. Yuan Xia Bohe's "Collection of Green Houses" says:</p>
<p>"Zhao Zhenzhen and Yang Yu'e are good at singing Zhugongdiao. Yang Lizhai saw them singing Zhang Wuniu's and Shang Zhengshu's compiled 'Double Gradual Small Township'..."</p>
<p>According to the "Collection of Green Houses," it is indeed based on something. Yang Chaoying's "Taiping Yuefu" Volume 9, Yang Lizhai's "Partridge Sky" poems and "Shao Bian" San Tao also record this matter. First, there is Yang Chaoying's small preface, saying:</p>
<p>"Zhang Wuniu and Shang Zhengshu compiled 'Double Gradual Small Qing.' Zhao Zhenzhen is good at singing. Lizhai saw Yang Yu'e singing his songs, so he made 'Partridge Sky' and 'Shao Bian' to praise it." According to the lower half of the "Partridge Sky" poem:</p>
<p>"Crying jade flute, sobbing ice strings. After Wuniu's death, there is no more transmission. The old pen of the lyricist and the beautiful mouth of the singer, re-summon the spring breeze to the eyes." The last three songs of the "Shao Bian" suite say.</p>
<p>"[Second Kill] Who quietly remembers him? Who coldly asks about him? There are still people who see the saddle and think of the horse. Zhang Wuniu's creation is like selecting jade from stone, Shang Zhengshu's recomposition is like adding flowers to brocade. Shatter that pearl ring, the four heads are lively, the branches and knots are skilled and smooth.</p>
<p>"[One Kill] I learn to sing, you learn to speak, who dares to compete with the predecessors. Zhao Zhenzhen first occupied the top of the list, Yang Yu'e temporarily filled the second house. Spreading the Dharma for the Buddha, flute knocks on the moon, board sprinkles red teeth.</p>
<p>"[Tail] Must not teach a sentence to be wrong, a half character to be different. Sing a book of multi-sadness, multi-thought, and multi-love words, teach you to listen to a romantic prodigal son." (Hanfenlou's photo-printed Yuan edition contains the second half of this suite, and the Ming Wanli movable type edition collects the complete suite.)</p>
<p>According to the above records, "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao" was compiled by Zhang Wuniu and Shang Zhengshu. The "Collection of Green Houses" clearly states that it is Zhugongdiao, but the small preface of "Taiping Yuefu" does not specify it. However, according to the "Shao Bian" suite "I learn to sing, you learn to speak," it is clearly Zhugongdiao, because it is precisely about both speaking and singing.</p>
<p>The "creator" of this Zhugongdiao, Zhang Wuniu, was the person who first created "Zuan Ci" in the early Southern Song Dynasty. Nai Deweng's "Ducheng Jishang," Wu Zimou's "Menglianglu" Volume 20, and Wu Zeng's "Nenggaizhai Manlu" Volume 1 all have the same records. "Menglianglu" says.</p>
<p>"During the Shaoxing years, Zhang Wuniu Datian, after hearing the Taiping Ling or Zuan Guban in the moving drum board (that is, the current Bai Ban's large section's inflection point), then wrote a complaint."</p>
<p>Zhang created "Zuan Ci" during the Shaoxing period, and the Zhugongdiao seems to have also been made at this time, only eighty or ninety years away from Ze Zhou Kong Santuan, who first created Zhugongdiao during the Xining and Yuan祐 periods (1068-1093).</p>
<p>The re-compiler, Shang Zhengshu, named Dao, was a Yuan Dynasty person and an official scholar (see Zhong Sicheng's "Record of Ghosts and Gods" "Predecessors Who Have Died"). Yuan Haowen called him: "Humorous and chivalrous, with the style of the ancients." In addition to Zhugongdiao, he also made Sanqu. The fifth volume of "Yangchun Baixue Qianji" collects four branches of Tianjingsha Xiaoling, and the sixth volume of "Taiping Yuefu" has a set of Yue Zhao Ting. "Yuefu Xinsheng" Volume Shang records Xinshui Ling, Yi Zhi Yi (two sets), Liangzhou Seventh, Yexingchuan, and Feng Ru Song. "Feng Ru Song" also has another set: a total of four Xiaoling branches, eight suite sets. His words belong to Qingli. Yinning Xianwang Zhu Dian's "Taihe Zhengyinpu": Zhengshu's words "Shang is like the scattered steps of the morning glow."</p>

<h3>Two Chapters of Cloud Flags</h3>
<p>— Hu Mu</p>
<p>Clouds</p>
<p>Clouds, flashing in the blue sky of dusk, white clouds, ochre clouds, sky blue clouds, vermilion clouds... On sunny days, I love to go out with my walking stick, so beautiful clouds fill my beloved little bridge, flowing water, village, green fields...</p>
<p>I love clouds. Therefore, I live in a valley with many clouds and fog. In this quiet valley, I forget spring and autumn.</p>
<p>But, I always remember that outside the clouds, there is still my hometown with white clouds flying and streams gurgling, oh: on that dear, warm earth, there are family members waiting for me to return, there are wildflowers and flocks of cattle and sheep waiting for me to return...</p>
<p>Clouds, I want to sail on your silver-white sails, taking eternal laughter, to sail outside the mountains.</p>
<p>Clouds, you are like ginseng floating in my heart.</p>
<p>Just as the poet Shelley sang for the west wind, I write poems saying, "Beautiful clouds rise into the blue sky."</p>
<p>Clouds, I live firmly every day for you. I write the chapters of human suffering for you every day...</p>
<p>Clouds, white clouds are our flag, a white flag of peace waving....</p>
<p>Fiery red clouds are the blue blood we shed, sky blue clouds are the beautiful dreams we pursue...</p>
<p>I love the flowing in the jade blue sea of ​​heaven, so my breath has the smell of the sea, I recall those days by the sea, there are my love and hate, there are traces of my childhood with childhood sweethearts.</p>
<p>I want to be in love with the clouds, until the people in the villages and fields have all lit up their lights.</p>
<p>Clouds, waving, I look forward to, until the night steals up from the mountains on all sides.</p>
<p>Flag</p>
<p>I am in love with the flag.</p>
<p>The flag, fluttering, leaping, waving.</p>
<p>I love our flag, when the flag is waving in front of the team, so our will is pursuing the flag, the flag is directing us to advance, advance...</p>
<p>On the boundless field, under the call of the flag, we form a solid team, like an unbreakable chain, for the happiness and freedom of China, we set off with a smile to march...</p>
<p>Flag, quickly tie the flag.</p>
<p>Where there is a flag, there are our dear people and comrades.</p>
<p>Because, I dearly love the flag. So, under the vast flag, I continue to walk, to the place full of laughter, tears, sound and light...</p>
<p>With a flag of will, we have a truly bright path.</p>
<p>With a flag of justice and freedom, we can gain happiness and freedom.</p>
<p>The flag is waving, leaping, waving in our youth ranks.</p>
<h3>Poems from Dream Outside the Building</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Listening to Qin and Singing</p>
<p>A husband's ambition is to dominate the four seas, but he gathers the four seas into one heart. He burns incense, sweeps the floor, and sits with his eyes closed, suddenly hearing the rustling of pine trees. Writing the meaning in my chest, because of your qin music. One string on your fingers turns and turns, in the Wuxia Gorges, the clear autumn is late in the day. The roaring of the mysterious ape on the ridge is low at first, and the sound of the lonely crane in the clouds is gradually distant. The flying spring of a solid stream has endless thoughts, and the clear commercial music of the green water is melodious and fluent. Spring birds and autumn leaves are outside the soul, and the remaining sound floats in dreams. Moving emotions three thousand miles across the sea, peeking at the moon twelve times by the building. At this time, the river moon and river water are clear and boundless. The water moon shines brightly, rippling with secluded feelings, and the hills and valleys all appear on the strings and fingers. The sad sound changes tune and suddenly becomes sad and poignant, breaking the heart over the mountains and passes, in the rain, wind, and snow. Jing Ke's Song of parting at the Yi River, Su Wu and Li Ling parting at the river bridge. Looking up at the floating clouds at the beginning of the Tai, the universe has existed for ten thousand years. What is the value of fame and fortune in the world? Let's not let the qin and wine be lonely.</p>
<h3>Pearl Shells</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dun</p>
<p>Like shells, like pearls, like stars, whether on the beach, in the sea, or in the sky, we all have our own brilliance!</p>
<p>On the silver sandy beach, there are as many shells as stars in the sky. Every shell is left with the waves of the sea. You who pick up shells barefoot, besides leaving countless footprints on the beach, you have already gained the wisdom of the sea—accommodating everything and giving everything brilliance!</p>
<p>Adventurous pearl divers go to the bottom of the sea to find the round pearls—the fruit of the mother shellfish's lifelong hard work. In order to add a little beauty to the world, pearl divers entrust their lives to the sea, and countless pearl divers have disappeared on the seashore. Thus, more pearls are accumulated in the world—like stars in the sky! Pearls are formed because of the mother shellfish's disaster, and countless painful results accumulate our wisdom and happiness!</p>
<p>On the beach, looking up at the brilliant starry sky, every star is an ideal, an eternal symbol! Shell pickers, pearl divers, star lovers, all who love brilliance and pursue brilliance, your discoveries will all be in accidental insights and constant painful efforts.</p>
<p>Picking up shells, harvesting pearls, people reverently lower their heads under the starry sky, people always yearn for more distant and eternal things. Therefore, people themselves have brilliance, like the stars in the sky...</p>
<h3>Madame Recamier</h3>
<p>— Girard</p>
<p>Girard was also a major member of the Neoclassical movement, especially specializing in portrait painting. He can not only depict the character of the subject but also fully express the spirit of the era.</p>
<p>Madame Recamier was originally a star in the social circle at that time. When David was painting her portrait first, Girard was unwilling to be outdone and also made this portrait for her. The picture is larger than the one painted by David, but he used skilled and agile skills to complete it earlier. As a result, Girard became famous overnight and became the darling of the society at that time. The original is in the Petit Palais in Paris. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Lonely Night</h3>
<p>— Yang Lida</p>
<p>Loneliness lingers between your fingers,</p>
<p>Loneliness lingers by my side.</p>
<p>Loneliness lingers in the evening breeze,</p>
<p>Loneliness lingers under the starlight.</p>
<p>Loneliness lingers in quiet corners.</p>
<p>Loneliness lingers in the vast night.</p>
<p>- After listening to Ma Sicong playing Tchaikovsky's Andante Cantabile.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 157</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"What exactly happened last night? Tell the truth, what kind of tricks is that old fox playing lately?"</p>
<p>"He almost figured out your plan. If it weren't for Aoki-sensei's intervention, putting on a similar operation to fool him, it would have been very dangerous!... But it doesn't affect you personally; he just wants to see what you are doing, so he only set up intelligence posts and didn't attack your operations. This is his style—'leniency'—knowing that you can't do anything in the first place. Their defense is tight, and their intelligence is keen, beyond your expectations. Do you know who else was there yesterday?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea..." Tsurumi let her say more to understand everything.</p>
<p>"The third person of the Black Dragon Society, the extremely powerful 'Hashimoto Toranosuke', arranged everything last night. He's going to be deployed soon, so Aoki-sensei ordered me to help you..." Pingzi couldn't help but smile. She seemed to know that Tsurumi disliked her very much, so she herself found it funny to say the word "help."</p>
<p>"What's the meaning of 'leniency'?"</p>
<p>"He wants you to sincerely and happily work for him."</p>
<p>"What if some of the things I do don't fit into his plan?"</p>
<p>"It's difficult... that 'bitch' is participating in the Orchid Group, she may report everything about you. Besides her, there are many others!"</p>
<p>"You are one of them, right!" It was Tsurumi's turn to laugh.</p>
<p>"As you wish, but I will always protect you!..."</p>
<p>"Do you think we can work together to find a way to get the 'Secret Seal'?" Immediately changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Please rest assured; Aoki-sensei said that our goal can definitely be achieved, just when I decide to return to my country... Alas, but I am also 'making clothes for others'—even if it succeeds in the future, it doesn't necessarily mean any benefits will be on my body!"</p>
<p>"Who is that 'Sister Chunzi'? I thought she was a man!"</p>
<p>"She is the direct descendant of Aoki-sensei's kendo system 'Hirano' master; do you think she is powerful? She also has two kinds of weapons, the flying rope knife and the willow-leaf sword, that she hasn't used yet... She is now a third-level monk, indifferent to worldly affairs." Pingzi showed a miserable smile.</p>
<p>"I am very grateful to Elder Aoki for his care; but there are still some things I don't understand..." Tsurumi said hesitantly.</p>
<p>"It's probably not that you don't understand, but that you are not at ease!... Let me tell you, he already knows eight or nine out of ten things about you. The old man once said, 'We have the same goals but different paths'! However, we seem to be cooperating sincerely!"</p>
<p>Tsurumi and Pingzi were communicating with hand signals. The woman opposite them seemed to be somewhat aware, but she just sneered slightly, pretending not to hear or ask, and looked out the window. At this time, the plane had been flying for a long time, piercing the clouds and the sky, aiming at that vast and uncontested broken land, roaring and advancing rapidly. How many times has it flown across the sea like this, I don't know how many more times there will be in the future, and I don't know how much trouble it will bring, how many bones and flesh will be broken apart on that land, how many lives will be sacrificed, how many tears of sorrow will be shed by those poor children! (End of Chapter 6)</p>

<h3>Sloppy Year</h3>
<p>— Ruosi</p>
<p>There is a saying: "Clean Winter Solstice, sloppy year."</p>
<p>I don't know if it's because the Winter Solstice of a cloudy year didn't rain; the weather at the Lunar New Year is always strange. The wind and rain are truly desolate. Many people who "squeeze" through the New Year's pass and welcome the New Year are squeezed through with mud and water, frowning, looking embarrassed and miserable.</p>
<p>But after all, the New Year's pass has been squeezed through. Those who have fallen have fallen, and those who have not fallen? Naturally, they are still standing there. Those with strong backs, needless to say, are still standing tall; those with insufficient strength have undoubtedly been squeezed and their original energy has been greatly hurt. But after reviewing: although the year is sloppy, it has become the past. Learning from the past can guide the future. Looking at the future, is there a need to make new changes? Or repeat the old tune and prepare to squeeze through another sloppy year?</p>
<p>Looking at the weather, it is indeed a bit ominous. After a sloppy end of the year, a sloppy beginning of the year follows. Recently, it doesn't seem like there are any signs of clearing the clouds and seeing the blue sky.</p>
<p>At the end of the Lunar year, I paid attention to "weather forecasts" every day, and there were "improving" signs every day, but it didn't "improve" every day. It dragged on day after day, and as a result, it dragged on into a "sloppy year", and it still affects the new year, which is really not pleasant.</p>
<p>Looking at the peace talks over the past year, talking and fighting, fighting and talking, when Marshall first came to China, he flew all over the country, spreading seeds of peace. The Chinese people couldn't help but feel that the mediator had worked hard, but everyone hoped that the soldiers would "rest," so they all welcomed friends of peace. Unexpectedly, running around was just running around, and talking and fighting continued until the end of the Lunar year. Marshall flew back to the United States, and the military mediation department was in a state of terminal illness. Although the soldiers did not "rest", Marshall's running around in China was about to "rest". Finally, it dragged on until the Lunar New Year, and Yan'an rejected the peace envoy Zhang Zhizhong. The peace news suddenly turned rigid, and it also squeezed through a "sloppy year". It was very disappointing.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the New Year, the weather is certainly not very clear, and I hope that the political weather will not be the same. I hope it can become clear in a decent way. As long as the political weather is clear, even those friends who have been squeezed down and injured by the New Year's pass, resulting in frowns, embarrassment and misery, will also become clear. Because the Chinese people have deeply understood the taste of "sloppy" after experiencing this "sloppy year".</p>
<p>It is really so-called:</p>
<p>"Eating cold water in cold weather, every drop is in the heart."</p>
<h3>The Lovable Common People</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Reflections on the Passing of the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>Before the Lunar New Year, there was a chorus of complaints about "not being able to get through the year." Unexpectedly, once the New Year arrived, there was a flurry of congratulatory greetings, and everyone was happy. The difficult year had, after all, passed, passing by in a muddle!</p>
<p>These past few days, firecrackers have filled the air, drums are everywhere, and everyone has forgotten all their sorrows. This is originally the muddle-headedness of the Chinese people, but it is precisely this that is the Chinese people's strength. They can endure pain, forget pain, and transform pain into joy, replacing despondency with hope! There is no need to criticize this "rare muddle-headedness." Without it, the War of Resistance could not have been sustained for eight years!</p>
<p>After getting through another year, one cannot help but praise the lovableness of the Chinese common people! They are good at accepting suffering and good at seeking hope!</p>
<p>Every household, no matter how poor, will paste cheerful Spring Festival couplets with smiling faces when the New Year arrives. Even more commendable is their ability to place their hopes on their descendants. This is why China is different from India.</p>
<p>Reality is so harsh, yet the common people still work hard and bear hardships without complaint, filled with enthusiasm. The scene of the Lunar New Year is truly moving! I must repeat: the common people are lovable! (But what should be emphasized here is the phrase "common people.")</p>
<h3>Those Pardoned and Released from Prison Talk About the Flavor of Iron Bars</h3>
<p>— Li Sheng</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. He, was imprisoned due to litigation. He had already fully experienced the flavor of iron bars for five months when he was pardoned and released before the Lunar New Year's Eve. Knowing that we had reunited, it felt like lifetimes had passed. In addition to joy, we had a delightful conversation about the circumstances in prison, which were bizarre and peculiar. I have specially selected and recorded them below. What follows are his own words:</p>
<p>First Entering Prison</p>
<p>When I first entered prison, I didn't understand any of the rules. They locked me in a small room. It is said that new inmates must first be locked in a solitary cell; it is like baptism before entering the church. The old inmates here call the new inmates' entry into the solitary cell the euphemistic name "Solitary Gate." Besides new inmates, old inmates who do not follow prison rules or fight with each other are also thrown into "Solitary Gate." Therefore, "Solitary Gate" is the worst treatment for inmates.</p>
<p>The Battle of "Solitary Gate": After I was locked in "Solitary Gate," an old inmate responsible for errands came in. This kind of inmate who is responsible for errands is called "Mao Putou" (Hooligan).</p>
<p>After Mao Putou came in, he asked me for money, demanding 300,000 yuan at the start! At that moment, I was filled with righteous indignation and slammed the door with force, hitting Mao Putou on the head. Not paying attention, he ate my blow, and fell to the ground. I then grabbed a toilet lid (because there were no other weapons) and hit him on the head, followed by a punch to the chest. Mao Putou immediately fainted. I became frightened, but the fellow inmates all cheered and said: "Good! A college student has guts!" At this time, the person in charge asked me why I committed violence in prison, and I said that he was trying to extort money from me.</p>
<p>Being Shackled:</p>
<p>They said that I had violated prison rules and put a sixteen-jin shackle on my feet as punishment. I generously allowed them to shackle me. But then, I "couldn't walk, brother!" Later, some well-meaning old inmates said, "You are naive. You got shackled but didn't even ask for a piece of shackle cloth. How can you walk?" Then, someone saw me as a hero and volunteered to ask for a piece of shackle cloth for me. They wrapped the chain around my waist with the shackle cloth and had to learn to walk with "shackled steps."</p>
<p>I Appealed: The four words "shackled and imprisoned" I had seen in novels, but now I personally experienced it. They said they would shackle me for a month, but I couldn't bear it after one day! The next day, I made a "report" saying that Mao Putou wanted to extort money from me, and I became violent in anger. If you say I violated the rules, then is Mao Putou's fraud acceptable? This "report" was approved, and they removed my shackles. Removing the shackles was even more painful than putting them on – extremely painful – but it is cheaper to be literate when facing lawsuits.</p>
<p>Making Friends with Fellow Inmates:</p>
<p>I was a minor offender and was only sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Later, the judge added another six months because I had received higher education, making it a year. Serving a year of imprisonment, I was despised and called a "rice thief" by the old inmates! When I first entered prison, I injured Mao Putou, so the old inmates also treated me with respect. As time went on, I got to know many fellow inmates, including robbers who killed and stole, talented and knowledgeable political prisoners, and petty thieves who stole chickens and dogs.</p>
<p>Well-Informed:</p>
<p>Many people think that prisoners are not very well informed about outside news, but this is not the case. As time went on, I was also able to go outside (within the prison grounds), or sometimes I was transferred to a different cell. Each cell held four inmates. Therefore, I knew more about the true stories of each person's crime than the judge, such as the cases of Liang Dai'an and other criminals, and the Guo Ying case, all of which I saw personally. Guo Ying even gave me a towel with perfume on it, but Guo Ying's handwriting was terrible, like that of a third or fourth-grade elementary school student. He was also very old, about forty years old.</p>
<p>Strange Prison Stories:</p>
<p>The cooking room was managed by female inmates. Among the female inmates was Zhou, whom everyone in prison called "Thirteen Cuts." "Thirteen Cuts" had a face the color of gray paper and walked barefoot, carrying water inside. Sometimes, when she heard people call her "Thirteen Cuts," she would yell: "You floating corpse! I'll cut you thirteen times!" - There was also the main character who conspired with the boss to murder her husband; her face was also very ugly. It's really strange! Yu Xiangdun doesn't receive much support in prison anymore. Now, only a group of scholars from the university help him. Yuan Ludeng pastes matchbox covers in prison to relieve boredom...</p>
<p>Finding Joy in Suffering:</p>
<p>Although there are many workshops and libraries in prison, sometimes it is still unavoidable to be bored. There was a Russian in prison who taught me Russian. I would forget it after he taught it, and I wasn't interested. But he still wanted to promote his political views to me. - In the midst of boredom, we also came up with ways to entertain ourselves. The female prison was one floor below us. We dug a small hole in the floor (old inmates call digging a hole "opening a peach garden") and used an iron wire to hang food down, but we required them to sing or dance as payment. We would watch and listen at the "peach garden" opening.</p>
<p>Among the female inmates, there were many young singers and dancers, and some could sing Peking opera well. As long as we threw cigarettes down, they would dance and sing, but how could they have music? With no other option, we could only hit the "toilet lid" to create rhythm. The dancers and singers below performed well and with vigor, and our pounding on the toilet lid caused the toilet to leak!</p>
<p>Corrupt Officials and Traitors Crying:</p>
<p>When I "escaped" (was released), I took many clothes and bedding out of prison. Many traitors and corrupt officials inside cried together. I had been with my fellow inmates for a long time, and feelings inevitably arose, so I also shed tears.</p>
<p>"You are not a hero if you haven't been here, and you're not worth half a penny if you come again" is the couplet in prison.</p>

<h3>Jiang Dingwen, Who Recently Went Abroad</h3>
<p>— Sun Dianwei</p>
<p>General Jiang Dingwen took the General Meigs ship to the United States on the third of this month. Before leaving, Jiang told reporters on the ship: "This trip abroad is purely for personal sightseeing and has no other tasks. I plan to stay in the United States for half a year and then go to other parts of Europe. I expect to return home in a year, at which time I will pay more attention to social construction and local administrative points in various places."</p>
<p>General Jiang Dingwen was a famous general during the Northern Expedition. His loyalty and courage during the Xi'an Incident won him a lot of praise. Anyone who thinks of this brave general who once dominated the battlefield will respectfully salute. Who knew that he was an exceptionally approachable person, tall, with a thick face. Although he is not often seen smiling, he speaks with great gentleness. His loud voice reflects his uprightness, and his sincere demeanor reveals his loyalty.</p>
<p>General Jiang Dingwen, courtesy name Mingsan, is from Moshi Mountain, Zhuji. His family was very poor when he was young. At the age of nine, he entered Tuanshan Elementary School. After graduating, he couldn't afford to continue his studies, so he resolutely joined the army. At that time, Jiang was only eighteen years old, but his decisive spirit surpassed others. Whenever there was a battle, Jiang would bravely charge forward. During the campaign against ×, Jiang was seriously injured and lay stiff on the battlefield for more than ten hours before being rescued. But Jiang never showed any signs of sorrow and did not shed a single tear, truly having the demeanor of Lord Hanshou Ting when he cut his arm to extract an arrow.</p>
<p>Amidst his busy military life, Jiang continued to diligently pursue academic exploration. At the Huangpu Military Academy, Jiang once said to the then-President Jiang: "I am not afraid of death. If you want me to charge into battle, I will absolutely obey; but when there is no need to die, I still hope to study." After the success of the Northern Expedition, Jiang asked Chairman Jiang to recommend him to the Army University or to study abroad. But at that time, the Chairman Jiang relied heavily on Jiang and did not want him to leave his side, so he did not agree to his request. In a speech to the Zhuji expatriates, Jiang once said: "I can say that my life has been bright and upright, without shame when looking up or down. My disadvantage is that I read fewer books in my childhood, which made me an 'unlearned' person. Therefore, whenever I encounter something, I often feel inadequate to deal with it. This is truly the greatest regret of my life!" From this passage, we can see what a humble person Jiang is!</p>
<p>This time, Jiang finally obtained a special permission from the Chairman and took a ship to the United States on the third. His long-cherished wish for decades has finally been fulfilled today, which can also fill the void in his heart.</p>
