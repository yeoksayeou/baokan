<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕國軍收復延安後中共反毛運動，益趨激烈。此由最近國軍於前方檢獲之共軍反毛宣傳品中，足以證明。此項宣傳品署名「中國共產黨非常委員會蘇魯皖邊區黨務委會」。宣傳品其原文如下：</p>
<p>（一）反對毛澤東武裝打天下</p>
<p>偉大的抗日戰爭勝利後，我們的指戰員及全國人民還不能得到生息，仍舊在烽火連天出生入死的過着戰爭生涯。這是如何慘痛的事。大家應知道，這完全是毛澤東左傾錯誤一手所造成武裝打天下的惡果。</p>
<p>可是二十年來的武裝爭鬥政策，幷沒有使我黨政治地位上的增高，而且使我黨走進牛角尖。十年土地革命，犧牲了紅軍主力突圍北上，把已鞏固的江西蘇維埃政權，在武裝鬥爭中斷送了。</p>
<p>溯自國共合作八年的神聖抗戰，我黨領導下之武裝，又在民族解放鬥爭中壯大了，在反抗日本帝國主義侵略的自衛戰爭中，創建了許許多多可歌可泣的偉大戰果，當時我們是絕對的贊同，幷且極力的主張。</p>
<p>現在全國人民需要生息，需要安居樂業，在和平民主的政治潮流中，我們主張和平建設，合理解決國共問題，反對毛澤東個人自以爲是的主觀性統治全黨，以武裝鬥爭，奪取政權，放棄劃時代的政協會議之爭取。這完全是左傾機會主義的盲目行動。我們非常委員會全體同志，不能坐視毛澤東領導我黨走上危亡的道路，早在一九四四年十二月一日決議中，向毛澤東提出嚴重的抗議，指出毛派的左傾的錯誤。</p>
<p>三年來毛澤東左傾錯誤，不但沒有絲毫糾正，更變本加厲的獨意孤行，擁軍擴伍，純以武裝打開天下的英雄觀念，使我國遍地又燃燒起血腥的烽火。全國人民在堅苦艱危的民族戰爭中走出來，又被捲入這無辜的國內混戰。這不僅是人民的損失，且係我黨本身的損失。</p>
<p>在各黨派政治協商會議的前後，全國人民與各小黨派及社會賢達，是如何的同情我黨，贊助我國以政治解決國是，然而自毛派促成大同，張家口會戰，至調回周恩來策動各地的軍事盲動攻勢後，我黨喪失了多少同志。如民社黨，靑年黨，，社會賢達以及全國人民，對我黨的反映，是如何惡劣，紛紛投向國民黨懷抱，使我黨政治上受到莫大的打擊與損失，顯然是毛澤東英雄思想武裝打天下的結果。</p>
<p>時臨最後關頭，事實是再不容毛派的左傾錯誤武裝打天下之縱續。我們號呌全黨忠實同志及全國人民，一致起來，展開反對毛澤東左傾機會主義的鬥爭，及不顧人民利益的武裝打天下的混戰！</p>
<p>我們要和平，要安居樂業！</p>
<p>我們要毛澤東承認錯誤，停止混戰</p>
<p>我們擁護非常委員會迫使毛澤東下</p>
<p>（二）反對把人民當砲灰</p>
<p>這幾週來，魯南一帶軍事上的失利，從臨沂突圍到今天，是經過了不少激烈的戰鬥，犧牲了無數黨內優秀的指戰員和英勇的民兵，尤其是民兵犧牲的數字，足以使我們驚異。抗日戰爭勝利後，還會使人看到這血淋淋的現實。這完全是毛澤東左傾思想一手所造成的惡果。</p>
<p>毛澤東說「中國有四萬萬人民，我們用兩萬萬人來犧牲，求得最後革命的成功。」如果這話眞的變成事實，毛澤東的殘忍是多麼的可怕！他簡直是要把兩萬萬人民變成砲灰；這裏除了暴露毛氏的猙獰面目外，實在再也找不出它的任何理由！</p>
<p>今天人民需要和平，需要生息，這是戰後鐵的事實，依照目前國內外情勢，和平民主是唯一的趨向！絕對無可强辯的。我們祗有政治解決，獲得合法地位，領導人民走向富强康樂之道，才有出路！</p>
<p>不顧人民利益，把人民當做戰爭的資本，驅迫人民上戰塲常砲灰，一定有遭受人民反對的一天。我們一貫主張，反對國內混戰，反對把人民當砲灰，國家是人民組成的，我們愛護人民，一切爲人民利益打算，人民要想安居樂業，不替毛澤東派當砲灰，唯有擁護非常委員會，與我們携起手來，展開反對毛澤東的鬥爭。</p>
<p>停止國內混戰實現民主！</p>
<p>反對把人民當砲灰！</p>
<h3>國民黨中政委會　今舉行首次會議　主要議題討論政治方針</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國民然中央政治委會定二十八日晨假中央黨部舉行首次會議。該會係最近中常會決定恢復者，其主要任務爲討論國民黨對政治問題所應取之方針，除十七日中常會所選出之張人傑等二十五委員外，凡國民黨黨員之擔任府委，國府文官長及中常委者，皆爲該會當然委員。又根據組織法，該會主任委員由總裁兼任。</p>
<h3>美對華政策將確定　杜魯門與馬卿準備商討　本年六月底前或可揭曉</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕據今日此間消息靈通方面稱：美國對華政策間題，或將爲留待馬歇爾注意中最不緊急之遠東事件之一。據國務院官員預料，馬歇爾與杜魯門總統大約將於六月卅日，即在凍結中之美國進出口銀行對華五億美元貸款時效滿期以前，開始檢討美國對華態度。渠等稱：此次檢討，將對蔣主席任命孫科爲副主席及張羣爲行政院長，以擴大其政府基礎一事，加以考慮。惟此次檢討結果，是否將放鬆美國業已宣佈之政策，即美國須待蔣主席之政權實行民主化後，始能予以經濟援助，渠等不願預加臆測。渠等一致之意見，認爲「靜觀」政策，至少當再持續兩個月。國務院官員預料：馬歇爾在今後數週內，將對日本會議之時間問題，有所決定。渠等現尙不知莫斯科外長會議未能作任何重大進展，是否對召開會議，起草有關日本之和平條約，將增加額外之延遲。美國務院曾作假定，美國可能建議於今秋在華盛頓或舊金山召開此項會議。此項假定乃根據一種信仰，認爲四國外長，對德奧條約成立協議之最大難題，能在莫斯枓會議中獲得解決，今則此一信仰業已證明其爲錯誤矣。</p>
<p>當時認為，本年九月在紐約召開聯合國大會後，或即可使美國當局轉移注意力於對日事件上。現對德奧問題旣未能獲致絲毫協議，外長會議須再在倫敦召開，若干官員相信，日本和會至少將延期至明春召開。另一部份官員則認爲即使各盟國在今秋對於歐洲事件仍將爭執不休，美國仍當按照原定計劃，準備於今秋召開會議。因此馬歇爾之意見爲各方所熱烈期待，因杜魯門總統無疑將聽取渠之意見也。</p>
<p>關於其他遠東問題，馬歇爾必須加以決定者，乃涉及朝鮮與中國之問題。惟馬歇爾是否認爲蘇聯外長莫洛托夫接受其邀請，重新召開朝鮮境內之美蘇共同委員會，乃誠意之接受，此間人士尙不能加以確定，因莫洛托夫仍明白堅持須排除若干朝鮮團體參加朝鮮臨時政府。此間一致之意見認爲重開會議或將無望。惟同時大部份官兵員承認萬一會議不能煎開，將予蘇聯人士以宣傳之有利機會。此事或爲馬歇爾所欲避免者。馬歇爾又應定：國務院及陸軍部所提出之以四億五千萬美元援助朝鮮計劃，應於何時提交國會討論。此間官員稱：不問美蘇談判結果如何，對朝鮮經濟援助計劃，俱將向國會要求通過。惟渠等又稱：此項請求何時向國會提出，須待馬歇爾與杜魯門總統會商後，再行決定。按原來之步驟，本擬一俟國會通過援助希土計劃後，即行提出援助朝鮮之請求。</p>

<h3>美海軍船隻二七一艘　杜魯門令移交我國　並派代表團來協助我海軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門總統，今日頒發一行政命令，命海軍部長福萊斯特爾，將美海軍剩餘船隻二百七十一艘及船隻器材浮動船塢等，移交我國，並派遣代表團杜華，協助我國海軍。按美國當局所允海軍部長實施之法案，係上屆國會所通過者，俾以援助我國擴充及維持我國之海軍，上屆國會雖於去年七月，即通過此一法案，今日之行動，尙為實施此計劃之維持我國海軍。蓋此計劃，有待中國政局之澄清而延擱迄今也。杜魯門今日之命令中。予馬歇爾以最後裁奪之權，蓋海軍部長雖受命處理此事，但仍需得國務卿之同意，國務卿若於任何時間，認為再行移讓船隻或器材無助於公共利益時，則此項移讓，即應停止。總統命令內容如下：</p>
<p>（一）撥予中國二百七十一艘剩之海軍較小船隻及其所需之　動船塢，不收任何代價。（二）此類船隻及浮動船塢，應予修理裝備，且撥予中國使用及保養所需之各項器材，中國對此項費用，應以現金償付。（三）將有關此諸船隻及浮動船塢之計劃藍圖，其他文件及報告，交付中國，且將非秘密性之技術報告，及對建立及保養中國海軍之建議，送交中國。（四）為中國訓練使用此諸船隻及浮動船塢之人員，及海軍部長認為適當之他種海軍人員。（五）計劃派遣美海軍或海軍陸戰隊軍官八百名以內，兵員二百名以內之人員，前往協助中國海軍。海軍部官員稱：首批撥予中國船隻之數量，及撥交時間之計劃，刻已擬就。</p>
<p>按將船隻撥予我國之法案，為文生法案，此案係去年由國會冊封，但規定總統在未得國會贊同之前，不得將戰鬥艦航空母艦驅逐艦或潛艇撥於中國，美海軍於去年二月此一法案尙在國會考慮中時，即計劃撥付我國此二七一艘船隻，其中包括護航驅逐艦六艘，浮標及艦標供應艦六艘，登陸艇二一七艘，摩托砲艦六艘，長一三六英尺之潛艇追緊艦四艘，長一七三英尺之潛艇追擊艦六艘，長一一〇英尺之潛艇追擊艦十艘，油船三艘，測量艦一艘，修理艦二艘，浮動船塢二具，摩托掃雷艇或潛艇追擊艦八艘。海軍部某官員中央社記者稱：若干於租借法頞中撥予中國之船隻，亦將列入此二七一艘受總統命由海軍部長撥予中國之船隻中。渠並稱：一俟中國海員使用此類船隻之訓練完畢，及馬歇爾對此贊同後，即可撥交中國。</p>

<h3>越南法機濫炸僑胞案我向法嚴重抗議　應負全部責任懲兇賠償</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕越南法機再炸僑胞，致死傷百餘人事，我政府已在南京，巴黎，西貢三地，分別向法方提出嚴重抗議。據此間華僑團體及官方所得越南確實消息：法軍用機五架，本月十五日下午四時飛往南圻之永隆省泳濂市上空，對該市華僑第二集中區義和榖實施轟炸，死僑胞三人，傷一人，翌晨上午九時，法機三架復飛臨該區，大施轟炸，義和榖棧中彈，避難華僑死百餘人得傷十餘人，軾傷數十人，泳濂市前因越方擬實施焦土政策，迫令居民疎散，我僑胞特於該市附近設立集中區二處，高懸國旗，以資識別，並曾正式通知法方特加保護，勿於集中區上空投彈，我總領館亦曾函准法駐南圻專員轉知法軍當局，特別注意，故此次慘案，法方實應負全部責任。我駐西貢總領事尹鳳藻聞報後，立即向法方提出嚴重抗議，並派館員率領醫師，赴肇事地區辦理善後，調查詳情，我外部已向駐華法大使館提出嚴重抗議，並電令駐法錢大使採取同樣步驟，要求法方切實承認責任，履行法國保護華僑之諾言，迅即懲兇賠償。</p>

<p>〔中央社馬尼剌廿六日電〕此間晚報引載一高級外交人士談話稱：菲律賓在國外之「外交聲譽，」可能因菲政府對聯總要求之未能作合宜之處置而受嚴重影響。按聯總前曾要求菲政府，使現困居廈門，戰前確為留菲之華僑，得能及早返菲。該報稱：目前菲政府對聯總代表華僑可提出要求之冷淡反應，此間外交界人士一般認為極不合宜。聯總駐華代表團團長甘尼斯拒絕表示菲政府此種冷淡態度今後在華府方面引起何種可能之反應，渠稱：渠本人認為菲政府之態度不合常軌，且與其他聯總會員國在全世界遣送流落人民（按此乃聯總所負之主要任務之一）工作方面所表現之合作精神根本相達。甘氏闡明以前之報道稱：聯總向菲政府要求遣送之華僑人數僅四千人，所傳七千六百人一節乃係誤傳，七千六百人之數，乃去年經聯總遣送赴華之華僑數額，上述之華僑，乃係日人於佔領期內送往菲島令作苦工者，而等待遣送返菲之四千名華僑，乃係戰前離菲，或由日軍於佔領期內強迫運往中國，或係於戰時不堪日軍壓迫而避返中國者。</p>

<h3>新銀行法之評價</h3>
<p>銀行事業之在現代社會，關係公眾福利。銀行雖由股東集資創設，但向社會各階層人士吸收勞苦之所積，轉而加以運用，故銀行營業的安危，非獨影響所有股東，抑且影響一般公眾。因是政府為謀社會和金融的安定，必須對銀行加以管制。銀行的組織雖可以公司法為依據，但對銀行業務之管制，及公眾權益之保護，胥有賴於銀行法之實施。</p>
<p>國民政府成立後，鑒於銀行業務關係重要，於民國十八年一月與四月，財政部先後頒行銀行註冊章程及實施細則。其旨卽在限制組織不良，資力不足，營業不當等銀行的設立，以防患於未然。廿三年三月，國府又公佈銀行法，全文五十一條，舉凡銀行之組織，最低資本額之規定，設立核准之程序，營業之範圍，營業表報之公告，停業清算之程序，增資改組增設分支行之核准，違章事項之罰則等，無不嚴密規定；惟該法迄未施行，且舊銀行法，偏重於商業銀行，故廿三年七月四日，國府又公佈儲蓄銀行法。抗戰以後，財政部為適應戰時環境配合抗戰需要，於廿九年八月公佈「非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法」十條；卅年十二月，財政部鑒於銀號錢莊有更進一步管理的必要，乃將前頒辦法，補充修正為十五條，於十二月九日公佈施行。此後，全國銀錢行莊，自業務以至盈餘分配，自機構以至從業人員，自分支行處以至同業公會，靡不分別規定，嚴加管制。抗戰八年，大後方金融無大波動，政府的管制實有貢獻。復員以後，社會情況變廷，經濟回復平時狀態，立法院奉令整理銀行法，一年餘來，七易其稿，方於今年四月十二日，經立院財政經濟兩委員會決定，乃至六法院大會詳細討論，十七日完成一讀程序。其後銀聯及上海錢業公會，提出意見多項，請求採納；立院於接受民間意見後，始於四月廿四日大會三讀通過，卽將由國府公佈施行。</p>
<p>新銀行法全文，共十章，計一百十九條，舉凡銀行之組織，業務之定義，適用之通則罰則，銀行之登記特許，均予概括的；銀行，信託公司，錢莊，及外國銀行之業務，及其應受之管理，均分章列舉。從立法技術說，銀行法可說是立法院的精心結構，為商事法中最完備的一部法典；從立法精神說，銀行法的制定，為我國銀行學銀行業制度，開創一新紀元，不僅對銀行實施消極的管理，並積極指導其資金之運用，業務方針之安全穩定，配合國家的金融政策，促使銀行業務健全途徑發展，此實往昔各項法規章則之精神迥然不同者。茲將其重要原則及精神，評述如下：</p>
<p>（一）銀行本為一種公司，故銀行法規定銀行組織制度，營業登記，申請特許等，其程序凖用公司法之規定，在此意義下，銀行法可以說是公司法的子法。銀行法對於商業銀行，實業銀行，儲蓄銀行，信託公司，錢莊，採用平等精神，均概括視為銀行，且經營銀行業務之公司行號，亦視同銀行，必須依法登記，其行為受法律之管制。這是含有安定社會金融的重大意義的。</p>
<p>（二）政府過去對銀行之管理，重在事後檢查，或業務進行中之檢查；銀行法對銀行業務之發展，具有指導性的，故對各種銀行，各按其所屬種類，分別進行業務，無論存款放款，均作實體之規定。銀行依法享受權利，銀行依法履行義務，公平而不偏頗，實具有銀行專業化的精神。</p>
<p>（三）商業銀行注重靈活，實業銀行注意穩定，儲蓄銀行注意儲戶安全，信託公司注重信守契約，錢莊注重習慣，并優予發展躋于銀行之林。每類銀行有其專業性。分行支行不能自由設置，必須注重當地之需要，所以分支行必須應需要而設立，不能應本身便利而設立，此有利于國家及地方之經濟發展。</p>
<p>（四）為保障金融安定及社會安全，銀行之準備金，應依法比例存于本行庫內，或活存國家銀行；銀行對所收受之存款，應依法定比例儲存保證準備金，不得非法提用。此不僅保護儲戶權益，且杜絕銀行的違法投機。所以銀行法對于銀行的活動，并不於事先事後加以統制，僅作立法上的豫防。同時第四四條更規定：「銀行為保障存款人利益，應聯合成立存款保險之組織」。皆為求事先風險之豫防，逆料今後銀行信用，必甚強大。</p>
<p>（五）銀行法對于人事部份，亦有規定。銀行負責人或職員，不得為任何方式之信用放款，更不得向存戶貸款人收受佣金，違者處罰。此為倡導銀行從業人員奉公守法的精神，如能實施有效，足以提高工作效率，整飭防杜因私害公之事態發生。此項人事規定，關係重要，主管官署應有嚴密之事後檢查，始可成功。</p>
<p>（六）銀行法尙有一重要之特點，卽外國銀行在華之設立，登記之特計，資金之運用，列有專章。同時規定在華之外國銀行，收付款項以中國國幣為限，實為獨立國家應有的管理制度。此項制度之精神，極為合理，何待多言。</p>
<p>以上評述，僅舉犖犖大者而言，銀行法理路正確，辦法周詳，我們應有良好的評從。希望國府公佈施行後，主管官署依法為行政措施，納銀行業于正軌，這是有利於公眾權益，社會安全金融安定的事，希望早日付之實施！</p>

<h3>杜魯門親赴機場歡迎　馬歇爾返抵華府　昨夜白宮會議影響遠大　杜魯門主義今後或將更推進一步</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥於本日午後三時四十二分（格林戴治標準時間）自莫斯科乘坐飛機，返抵此間。前往機塲迎迓者，除杜魯門總統本人而外，尙有商務部長哈里曼，民主黨參議員康納利，美國政府高級官員及外交團代表。當馬帥下機與杜魯門總統握手時，羣衆歡呼之聲四起，攝影記者則爭相攝影，馬帥當即發表簡短談話稱：余在莫斯科業已完成一項重要之使命，匪特對於美國抑且對於整個世界，均有重大關係。希望世界不久即能更趨愉快，余對於美國之印象愈益良好。今日返抵本國，深感愉快，且蒙總統親來機塲迎接，不勝榮幸之至。杜魯門總統答曰：余對於馬帥在莫斯科所獲成就，殊感滿意。余深知全國人民聞及馬帥於本月廿八日晚發表廣播演說，報吿外長會議經過，必能感覺滿意云。總統與馬帥旋即驅車前往白宮，共同進餐。馬帥繼即乘坐飛飛機前往北加羅林納州柏恩赫斯德城與其夫人會晤，明日遄返華盛頓，出席杜魯門總統所當召集之重要會議。屆時民主共和兩黨領袖，內閣閣員及國務院高級官員，均將出席會議。馬帥在本月廿八日晚間發表廣播演說之前，不致發表其他聲明云。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿及國會領袖將於今夜在白宮晤談，由馬卿報告莫斯科之行之經過。國會領袖所最關切者，當爲史達林向馬卿所表示對於杜魯門主義之意見。史達林之反響，或能決定美國政府實行援助被共產威脅國家一項計劃之下一步驟。除希臘及土耳其外，朝鮮，伊朗，伊拉克，印度，埃及均已或即將請求美國援助。白宮及國會已在準備設立機構，以研究必要之步驟及所需之經費。非正式方面估計，全部援助費用將達五十億元。衆議院定於下星期三表決設立委員會，以便繼續硏究援助聲請之建議案。馬歇爾返國後第一件行政措施，當爲設立設計局，由蘇聯問題第一流專家甘南主持局務。馬歇爾與史達林晤談之經過向國會領袖提出後，如果證明美國尙有再向他國援助之必要，則杜魯門總統準備再度咨文國會，提出援助希土兩國以外仙國之計劃。關於援助朝鮮之計劃，已由國務院在硏究中。非正式方面估計援助數額將達五億四千萬元，擬分三期撥付。比外，可以减輕英法兩國經濟負担之間接援助，亦已在討論之中。莫斯科會議之失敗，將使德國東西兩部之裂痕俞益加深。由於莫洛托夫拒絕法國對薩爾區之要求，法國參加德境英美區合倂之可能性，已較前增加。果爾，則英法所負担之龐大佔領費，或可由美國分担一部份。</p>
<h3>美對外援助總值　達百五十五億元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕政府預算局頃發表第二次世界大戰結束以來美國所已核准或準備核准之對外民間援助，總値一百五十五億六千另七十萬美元，軍事援助尙不在內。援助項目如下：</p>
<p>（一）對英貸卅七億五千萬元，分期五十年拔還。（二）車川物資直接撥充民間接濟，八億二千四百萬元。（三）對日本朝鮮德國與奧國佔領區之救濟計劃，總額十四億五千萬元。（四）進出口銀行對外貸款二十億一千一百七十萬元，分期三十年償還。（五）剩餘物資之轉讓，似値十億三千萬元。（六）戰後租借法案項下援助價値十八億四千八百萬元。（七）船隻川售一億零七百萬元。（八）對菲律濱援助六億九千五百萬元，此款日後僅有一部份償還。（九）經由國際機構如聯總等之援助廿六億一千七百萬元。（十）聯合結束後之對外援助三億五千萬元。（十一）國際銀行股款六億三千五百萬元。（十二）國際難民機構基金七千五百萬元。（十三）對希臘援助一億五千萬元，（軍事援助不在內）。</p>
<p>此外，對國際貨幣基金團捐款廿七億五千萬元，用以穩定他國幣値，故不列入救濟範圍之內。</p>
<h3>美將以二千萬元　貸與匈牙利</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社匈牙利京城廿六日電〕頃據可靠方面消息：美國即將宣布以二千一百萬美元之貸款，界予匈牙利。此項貸款與以前二筆貸款（總數一千五百萬元）不同，匪特可由匈國政府用諸購買歐洲境內之美國剩餘物資，抑且亦可用諸購買美國貨物（何種美國貨物，則尙不得而知）。該項貸款與美國二家私人銀行貸與匈牙利用諸購買棉織物之七百萬元貸款，亦無關係。據匈牙利人士本日稱：此項貸款並非匈牙利政府向美國所要求者。又聞此項貸款，亦不在美國所擬用諸援助中，波，匈等國之三萬五千萬元範圍之內。</p>
<h3>美國務院開支　增加十倍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國外交界與普通主婦無異，亦受生活費用高漲之打擊。目前國務院之費用，較諸一九三九年增加十倍，口仍增加不已。物價之高漲，薪俸之調整，及美國在國際事務中之領導地位，均使國務院之開支日趨龐大。據統計所示，一九三九年國務之開支僅一千七百十二茁二千美元，當時共計公務員五千二百六十一人，而目前國務院之人數已達二萬一千人，其開支不問可知。美國外交費用之增加尙難道料何日可以停止，須視未來之國際關係而定云。</p>

<h3>土內閣會議　商美國援土事項</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城廿六日電〕關於美國援助土國一事，頃悉：土國內閣連日開會，討論此事。一俟美國駐土耳其大使威爾遜，於下週內自美返抵此間之後，土國政府即將與其進行談判。</p>
<h3>對莫斯科會議　加總理表失望</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社渥太華廿六日電〕加拿大總理麥克齊金今日自美返國。據談；渠對莫斯科會議表示失望，但希望其能便利今後之繼續談判，一如馬歇爾所希望者云。</p>
<h3>傳南國對奧要求　四強已秘密決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社維也納廿六日電〕奧國賣產管理及經濟計劃部次長本日由莫斯科返抵此間時談稱：奧國代表團深信南斯拉夫對卡林西亞之領土要求，已由四强外長在某次秘密會議中加以決定。奧國代表團係奧外長格爾柏所領導，格氏於抵遠此間時吿記者稱：渠在與奧總理費格爾商討前，不能向報界發表談話。渠在解釋對於德國在奧資產問題之美國立塲時，否認美國曾拒絕蘇聯之折衷方案，該方案曾被稱爲奧國所樂於接受者。渠並稱：奧政府願以奧東之八十一家企業歸還蘇聯，祗須此項企業之進行符合奧國法律去。</p>
<h3>奧外長評論　莫斯科會議結果</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞杜維也納廿六日電〕奧地利外長格魯柏甫於最近自莫斯科返抵此間，於今晚發表廣播演說，對於莫斯科四國外長會議之結果有所評論，略謂：四國外長會議榮已獲致相當進展，其所擬定之程序，可使和約之起草工作得以迅速加以處理。就實際之觀點而言，吾人對於外長會議殊無表示不滿之理由，但就心理之觀點而言，則不然。外長會議處理奧國問題之方式完全違反奧國希望成爲自由與獨立國家之目的，自由之奧地利將不賴盟國之政策，亦不願賴盟國之政策而再生云。</p>
<h3>聯大特別會揭幕　商巴勒斯坦問題　巴西代表可望出任主席</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿七日電〕聯合國特別大會將於明日開幕，討論巴勒斯坦問題，巴西首席代表奧斯華杜可望出任主席，以繼比國代表團長史巴克之任。聞五强與聯合國機構秘書長已贊成此議。同時大會尙須選舉副主席七人，五强爲當然副主席，外加菲律濱或印度副主席一人及南美國家之副主席一人。第六第七兩副主席係代替上屆副主席南非聯邦與委內瑞拉。大會之執行委員會亦將更新，由加拿大，瑞典，埃及，捷克與墨西哥組織之，以代替上屆之烏拉圭，鳥克蘭，敘利亞，巴拿馬與紐西蘭，僅波蘭連任。預料大會將歷時三個或四個星期。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿六日電〕巴勒斯坦問題聯合國特別大會定於廿八日開幕，英國與其他大國或將被迫表示態度。英美準備堅持特別大會議程，僅以討論調査委員會之組織爲限，但一部份代表定將提出其他困難問題。波蘭代表團則堅持英國及其他四强應包括在任何特別委員會之內。波蘭之主張，有時反映蘇聯各邦之態度，値得注意。</p>
<p>蘇聯態度　殊堪注目</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿六日電〕關係觀察家預料蘇聯在討論巴勒斯坦問題之聯合國特別全體大會中，可望支持巴勒斯坦獨立之要求，惟迄至目前爲止，蘇聯尙未表示將支持猶太族或阿拉伯族。蘇聯駐美大使諾維柯夫於去年十一月會在全體大會之託管委員會中，際明蘇聯認爲巴勒斯坦應置入聯合國機構託管之下或取得獨立。蘇聯今旣已抵制託管理事會，故料在特別全體大會中，當不致再提託管，而將主張使巴勒斯坦獨立。諾維柯夫於去年十一月會稱英國已使外約但獨立，何不使巴勒斯坦獨立。據接近蘇聯代表國之人稱：蘇聯尙反對猶太復國運動之正式要求，且蘇聯對於中東油源及戰略地具有甚大利益，而其國內亦有不少之回敎徒居民，故料蘇聯或富支持阿拉伯族而不願支持被美國資本家統制之猶太復國運動。預料在特別全體大會中，蘇聯將要求巴勒斯坦之獨立，建立猶阿兩族之比例代表政府，此舉即係表示巴勒斯坦將由阿拉伯大多數民族統治。最近蘇代表葛羅米柯與敘利亞代表柯里在安全理事會中曾有相互支持之表示，因此亦可窺見蘇聯對巴勒斯坦問題之傾向。</p>
<p>印度支持　阿族政策</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿六日電〕印度臨時政府內閣副總理尼赫魯與同敎聯盟主席眞納，業已通知阿拉伯聯盟，謂印度國民大會黨與回敎聯盟，對於阿拉伯各國在巴勒斯甩所採取之政策，表示完全同意，並將支持巴勒斯坦問題，提請聯合國大會討論云。</p>
<h3>聯大今日舉行　暹羅入會儀式</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿六日合衆電〕允暹羅加入聯合國之儀式，將於本月廿八日聯合國大會為討論巴勒斯坦問題而召開之特別會議中舉行。按一九四六年大會接近閉幕時，允暹羅加入聯合國。該次大會並允准瑞典·冰島·阿富汗入會。</p>

<h3>奧斯汀演說　力主對蘇應堅定沉着</h3>
<p>〔合衆社克里夫蘭廿六日電〕聯合國美代表奧斯汀本日在鐵路工人國際會議發表演說，要求美國在應付蘇聯時繼續採取堅決沉着之態度。奧氏並稱：袛有出此一途。原子能之管制應有達到有效組織之可能，奧氏預料「不久」即將與蘇聯獲致此項協議。美國對於聯合國決定是否須獲致和平一點，有莫大之影響。渠並列舉美國爲促進集體安全起見所必需採取之政策如下：（一）全力擁護聯合國憲章，必要時得採取武力；（二）運用聯合國已經建立之協調步驟；（三）協助受戰爭浩劫之國家恢復其經濟力量；（四）美國必須放棄「由惡意所引起，希望削减吾人預算」之任何片面裁軍計劃。</p>
<h3>克拉克即將返美　出任第六軍軍長要職　凱斯繼任美駐奧委員</h3>
<p>〔合衆社維也納廿六日電〕駐奧美軍司令克拉克將軍本日於招待記者時稱：四强外長會議之失敗並不能改變其返美就任第六軍軍長之計劃。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社維也納廿六日電〕美國駐奧地利高級委員克拉克將軍，定於五月十七日啓程返國，將就任太平洋沿岸某要職。據其本日向報界宣佈，所遺駐奧高級委員一職，將由凱斯將軍繼任，並謂渠不能代表美國出席五月十二日在維也納舉行之四强委員會，以討論對奧和約。以後究由何人爲代表出席，當須待國務卿馬歇爾元帥任命。此外又答覆記者問話稱：美國軍隊唯有至其他各國亦能撤離奧國時，始能撤退回國去云。</p>
<h3>保守黨對政府不滿　英政局轉趨緊張　內閣不日將局部改組</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕此間政界人士頃談稱：英國工黨內閣在工黨舉行常年大會之前，又將實行局部改組，殆可斷言。此事將由艾德禮首相與貝文外相曁柏密大臣莫里遜勛爵三人於下星期內會商，屆時亦將討論莫斯科外長會議未獲任何具體結果所造成之局勢。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕政府今日對保守派之批評發動還擎，正迅速演成政治大戰中。檢察長蔚克洛斯與燃料部長辛威爾分別發表演說，遵循昨日艾德禮首相採取之新方式，駁斥邱吉爾個人及其保守黨。同時，邱吉爾致函補缺選舉候選人再度譴責現政府之「糜費與失策」。自由黨總裁胡爾登要求該黨會同保守黨合力逐出工黨。政治仇視程度益形尖銳化，保守黨正鞏固其財政力量，起草政策新聲明，並積極策劃演說運動，爭取同志。工黨某要員稱，政府已對保守黨開始「聲勢浩大」之額說運動，準備再接再厲，「嚴峻答復」該熬批評。政府各部長官過去公開演說，極盡激勵能事，致力於解釋社會主義政策及全國人民務須刻苦工作，以期復興劫餘經濟。現已轉移重心，從事率直抨撃與辯護。部長多人激於保守黨之批評，均感覺有答復之必要。</p>
<h3>保守黨擬就　工業計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿七日電〕星期泰晤士報今日載稱：英國保守黨即將公佈工業計劃，長達一千頁，其中檢討短期與長期計劃，並將包括國營與民營企業間合作之若干建議。對工資問題亦有論列。此項計劃將與工黨政府之國營政策對立。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕約羅區本日舉行補缺選舉，前任首相邱吉爾致函保守黨候選人，對於工黨提供之不能實現之諾言大肆抨擊，「在六年戰爭之後，許多人民均已遺忘以前工黨內閣之失敗，並有許多人民以年事尙輕，不能憶及，因此乃受工黨諾言之影響擁護工黨執政云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿七日電〕麥帥今夜發表文告，謂日本全國普選結果，已表示日人堅決拒絕共產黨之領導。麥帥文吿係經總部新聞處發表。</p>
<p>自由投票　反映民意</p>
<p>內稱，此次選舉，千百萬日本人民，來自工廠·商店·家庭，來自鄉村農塲·鐵區，分赴投票處履行公民新義務，毫無畏懼，自由投票。選民之基本問題，厥爲選擇一種政治觀念。極右派集權主義，負有戰敗及長久壓迫民權之寳，已爲人民共棄，極左派共產觀念則仍存在，其領袖竭力博取民衆擁護。自佔領開始以來，共產黨員數千人已經釋出，此種觀念（共產主義及其領袖，均獲政治行動之最大自由，得與民主力量與信念，作公允的公開競爭，但在人民權衡之下，已吿失敗。日本人民堅決拒絕共產黨之領導，而以絕大多數選擇中庸之道，遠離兩個極端，俾確保自由之維護及增進個人之尊嚴。</p>
<p>實施新憲　開闢途徑</p>
<p>全國選舉已開闊途徑，得以實施日</p>
<p>本進步的新憲法，此乃人類「重大的精神運動之一」，足以表示「遠東之新紀元，並予日人民以另一機會」。日本人民已脫離奴役而入自由生活，「余信彼等不致辜負新義務」。日本人民抱愼重而誠懇之態度，依照規則，自由投票選定候選人，決無一人可加會議。此次選舉爲廿本有史以來之創舉，反映大多數人民之自由意志，而非少數人以專横手段，一意孤行，此即民主之謂，選舉旣已舉行，實施日本新憲法所必要之最後池備步驟，遂吿完成。</p>
<h3>日普選最後結果揭曉　麥帥特發表文告　強調共黨不受人民歡迎　日首次民主內閣當為聯合內閣</h3>
<p>〔亞東社東京廿七日電〕日本此次衆議院議員總選舉之結果，社會黨一踵面爲第一黨，自由黨民主黨退居第二第三黨地位，職是之故，五月二十日召開之第一屆國會時，朱來之政治中心勢將以社會黨之片山委員長爲中心，而日本亦將成立進步的社會主義政黨所指導之政權。但，社會黨合其左黨（共黨）在議會中所佔之議席，仍不能掌握絕對多數，故必須翼其他政黨取得合作。至於今後收拾時局之趨向，將爲（二）以社會黨爲中心組織社會民主自由國民協問等四黨聯合內閣；（一）由自由民主保守政黨之合作，而組織保守性內閣；（一）由社會黨單獨與自由黨或民主黨合作組成聯立內閣。又社會黨之片山委員長在獲悉選舉結果以後，曾於廿六日强調聯合內閣論，以此可以推測第一次民主內閣，即將成立聯介內閣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿七日電〕日本人民投票選出第一屆國會之社會民主黨議員計一四三名，本日奠定聯合政府之基礎，根據新憲法，聯合政府必須包括社會主義者。吉田首相所領導之自由黨已失去最多數之議員額，僅佔一三三席，幣原副相所領導之民主然居第三，共佔一二六席。茲將各黨議席列後：社會民主黨四三席，自由黨一三三席，民主黨一二六席，國民協同黨（保守派）三一席，共黨四席，少數黨十六席，無黨無派十三席。本屆女議員僅十四人，較上屆國會少廿五席。</p>
<h3>李承晚談　韓國政局</h3>
<p>擬提議設獨立政府</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿六日電〕朝鮮民主黨領袖李承晚新近自美返此，今日對於上海各報載其談話中所謂杜魯門總統擔保給予朝鮮六億美元貸款一節，加以否認。據稱，「杜魯門先生絕未對余有所保證，余最近一次游美，甚至與　晤面。余在上海談話，僅謂，美國政府正考慮援助朝鮮人民，此種援助倘若實現，吾人當樂於接受」。李氏談及朝鮮政治局勢時稱，渠將提議設立一種政府，以防美蘇聯合委員會來日談判失敗時，由該一政府與蘇聯進行談判。李氏擬敎促朝鮮南部臨時議會通過選舉法以便選出國會或議會，由此種機構制定憲法，作爲北鮮或南鮮獨立政府之基礎。美蘇聯合委員會談判朝鮮統一問題倘若失敗，朝鮮人將推進獨立政府之計劃，蘇聯倘拒絕合作，則朝鮮政府可向聯合國機構提出申訴。</p>
<h3>華萊士返美</h3>

<h3>美參院軍委會主席　譴責美軍缺乏準備</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕參議院軍事委員會主席甘奈昨發表廣播演說，譴責美軍在世界各處佔領區內缺乏應付任何緊急事變之準備。略謂：倘吾人明日即面臨重大之危機，則各佔領區內之美國軍隊必將被一大國所壓服。今美國旣無軍隊可以調遣應付重大緊急事變，復無軍隊可以加以防止。蓋美國現僅能徴集三十萬人，而一百萬兵員中大部份皆分散在各佔領區，担負其佔領或管理之任務故也。</p>
<p>渠並述及他日美國遭遇軍事攻擊之想像情形，認爲最大之危險在於內部之破壞活動及長距離之空中轟炸。長程轟炸機及火箭炸彈對於美國主要工業能有致命打擊，此爲一旦戰爭發生後之初期攻勢。繼之者可能爲傘兵之侵入美國國土及陸軍之展開正面攻勢。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿七日電〕「觀察家報」評述莫斯科會議之失敗，所得結論主張英美二國放棄波茨坦宣言之精神，在埃爾培河實行警戒工作，使之成爲抵禦共產浪潮之屛障，並與美國成立協議，使德國西部居於安定與自給有足之狀態中。略謂：英美合倂佔領區一事已吿失敗，殊不應再事錯失時機。二佔領區至今全無經濟復興之眞正跡象，而糧食情形則極端混亂，雙方處理此事意見又極紛歧，今爲解救此困難，則亟宜恢復魯爾區荷蘭法國三方面之貿易聯繫一，倘不放棄波茨坦宣言之精神，擺脫其限制與束　，則此一政策仍無成功之希望。今莫斯科會議又宣吿失敗，蘇聯復拒絕解除德國武裝之四强公約，遂使德國境內之意識戰綫劃分顯明，一若希土二國之北疆，成爲一重要之弱點。要知飢餓與災難乃共產宣傳最易滋長之地，今美國旣已在全世界抵禦共產主義之滲入與侵略，則不應忽視在埃爾培河實行警戒云。</p>
<h3>現階段的美蘇關係</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>世界上兩個最强大的國家，彼此的關係目前已經到了新的歷史性的階段，彼此公然宣佈互相猜忌的階段了。今後的演變如何，我們只可加以臆測，但不能作確定的預言。</p>
<p>美國對於蘇聯的擴張和侵略政策，認爲已經臨到必須攤牌的時候了。美國準備拿美元，軍火和軍隊作爲擁護民主反對極權主張的後盾。艾國堅定不易的對蘇政策在希臘和土耳其現已見諸實際行動。</p>
<p>自從英國宣佈自三月底起對希土兩國的援助不得不大爲减削後，杜魯門總統即要求國會以四億元貸與希土兩國，作爲救濟；同時，美國新政策至遲須於三月三十一目以前開始執行。國會领袖們一致同意，認爲到那時候，對於杜總統的請求，應該成立一項法律上的決議。</p>
<p>美國準備　採取行動</p>
<p>美蘇對立的新形勢突破了美國的傳統，引起美蘇關係的劇烈的轉變。杜魯門說：僅僅演說和外交上的抗議已經不足以保護民主主義反抗侵略勢力了，美國現在需要採取行動了。杜氏的意思就是說：不論蘇聯在什麽地方欲以極權主義加諸其他國家，美國就要在那裏採取行動。</p>
<p>杜魯門對國會提出的咨文並未要求改變對蘇關係。杜總統的演詞裏並沒有提到蘇聯兩個字。他祇說及侵略者，但沒有提出他的名字。同時，就美國而論，始終遵守着外交上的禮貌。蘇聯已經把駐在華盛頓，倫敦和巴黎的大使召回聽候訓示，但聲明這一個行動是暫時的。美國並沒有召回莫斯科的大使，同時聯合國機構和四强外長會議中的美方代表照常和蘇聯代表進行談判。在表面上，美國務卿馬歇爾和蘇聯外長莫洛托夫繼續舉行談判，一如華盛頓方面並未發生什麽事情似的。</p>
<p>美國的用意顯然是要使美蘇外交關係照常維持下去，旣無需訴諸武力，更沒有類似宣戰或絕交的暗示。美國此舉意在昭吿蘇聯：美國現已準備利用它的資源來制止蘇聯的擴張勢力和共產主義的蔓延。杜魯門的排詞故意弄得直截痛快，簡潔明自，使世人讀後一目了然，希望現在的坦白陳詞可以避免將米的拔刀相向。過去，世人有懷疑美國的對外政策的，現在這疑雲完全消散了。</p>
<p>美蘇猜忌　趨表面化</p>
<p>同時外交上的微妙關係不能掩飾美蘇兩國對於雙方意向的猜忌。希臘問題不過使美國的猜忌形諸外表而爲美國採取行動的前奏曲而已。</p>
<p>匈牙利問題沒有像希臘問題那樣惹人注意，因爲美國還沒有提到採取行動的話。但美國對於蘇聯意圖强迫勾牙利成立共產政府一節，已經提出嚴重抗議。</p>
<p>其他問題如蘇聯在波蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，南斯拉夫，伊朗，法蘭西，義大利，瑞典，挪威及遠東等處的行動，亦已引起美國的抗議。共產主義在拉丁美洲的發展已引起美國的警惕。此外，在美蘇軍隊對峙下的前敵性國家內，雙方的猜忌與日俱增。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於資本主義的美國之猜忌，自古已然，於今爲烈。照馬克思的定義，資本主義國家必然是侵略性的，帝國主義的和戰爭的製造者。莫斯科電台的這樣的指責在戰時總算暫時安靜下來，但現在又故態復萌了。</p>
<p>蘇報抨擊　援助希土</p>
<p>蘇聯對於杜魯門演說美第一個反響，是蘇聯政府機關報「消息報」把美國的新政策比擬為希特勒的政策。該報指責杜魯門要求國會援助希土防烈長略勢力的言詞，正是希特勒在將要攫奪一個國家時听施的慣技。</p>
<p>關於美國援助中國國　政府一事，蘇聯認爲違反中國人民的利益，因此莫洛托夫要求將中國問題提交四國外長會議討論。</p>
<p>實際上正如美國所見到的，草洛托夫的提議對希臘的關係更甚於中國。莫氏的提議適在杜魯門對國會發表演說以前。他認爲莫斯科提出中國的內戰問題，或許可使美國國會議員們知道美國不能促成中國的團結穩定。也許莫氏也以爲馬歇爾是美國對華政策的決策者。因此莫氏希望對中國問題引起辯論，以使馬歇爾陷入困境，使美國在莫斯科會議中採取守勢，並且在行將決定對希援助問題的國會議員心中，播下疑慮的種子。</p>
<p>在莫斯科方面，莫洛托夫對中國間題的施策以及對德國問題的討論，都因杜魯門的美國新政策聲明而黯然失色。從華府傳來的消息，是否等加强抑或緩和蘇聯的反抗，只有蘇聯自己知過。在談判德奧問題時，或許能得到解答。</p>
<p>在美國人眼裏，德國只是共產主義的蘇聯與資本主義的美閣間許多衝突的一端而已，根本的衝突還在美蘇兩國本身。美蘇兩國能否調和它們的衝突，已經成爲世界各國政府所最關心的一個問題了。（譯自「世界報吿」週刋）。</p>

<h3>伏波砲艦罹難官司兵家屬　昨招待新聞界報告呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕伏波砲艦過難官兵家屬王杭曼筠，朱蔡秀章，陳成莉俠等，昨日下午三時假民政處招待記者，發表書面報吿一件，茲錄誌如下：關於伏波軍艦被招商局海閩輪撞沉一案，近日報章均不斷有報導與評說。吾等艦上軍官之眷屬，係本案被害人之直系親屬，雖然在極度哀傷悲苦之中，但於本案未明之前，決不願公開表示意見。嗣經月餘奔走探詢，幷奉讀上海地方法院檢察處對海間輪主戴儒林起訴書後，認爲案情已極明朗。而此際傳說紛紛，要皆別有用心，希亂社會視聽。同時，今日社會錢能通神，仍屬難免，吾等已得見種種跡象，誠不禁興人間何世之感，茲幸本案公審在即，爰伸數義，籲請輿論督促本案進行，務須求得公正之結果：</p>
<p>撞沉伏波·繼續前駛</p>
<p>（一）海閩輪船主戴儒林曾在上海地檢處檢察庭上供認，撞船後停輪只數分鐘仍繼續前駛，此點地檢處起訴書內業已敘明，再證諸海閩輪乘客所述，已確鑿無疑。「伏波」官兵斯時待救水面，而海閩輪鼓浪向前，推進板擊動波浪益劇，致百數十海軍官兵悉遭滅頂。僅此一點，已足構成戴儒林犯海商法第一百二十八條之罪責。</p>
<p>救生器具·多未動用</p>
<p>（二）海閩輪碰撞伏波後前駛圖逃，經乘客責難，始回航施救，往返已費數小時。迨遇「伏波」輪機員焦德孝先生時，亦竟不作有效之營救，當時海關輪衆乘客　情憤激，除責置船長戴儒林外，幷鼓拗水手馬富根下水施收，幸得救起此唯一生還之焦德孝先生。此項在作證之乘客中業已有書面之證明。再地檢處査勘海閩輪，其救生器具，除救生圈兩只，救生板兩塊，在常時拋下海面外，其餘皆未動用。而拋下救生圈救生板時，亦竟未繫繩索，或緊而不牢，（有乘客證明），如此招商局之船長，顯有殺人滅跡之故意，其必應受刑法第二百七十一條規定之制裁，以儆效尤，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>見死不救·罪責難掩</p>
<p>（三）撞船責任與戴儒林見死不救係截然兩事，不能混爲一談，將來碰撞責任難屬，自有斷明之日，但戴儒林見死不救一事，當必仍由上海地方法院審訊處罪。今日有人欲以前一事遮掩後一事，其用意至爲明顯。蓋本案之處理，以人證爲主，時日拖延一久，則人證必有困難。</p>
<p>證人處境·將感困難</p>
<p>（四）此次上海地方法院於廿九日開庭公審本案，消息發佈，竟將證人姓名列入，此種舉動，將引起證人處境之困難，證人自本公正之立塲，但今日竟難免惡勢力之影響，前此開檢察庭時，少數證人即會通各種不同方式之煩擾，現在更堪虞慮。</p>
<p>（五）語云「道高一尺魔高一丈」，吾等請求社會公正人士，隨時本正義之立塲賜予援助。</p>

<h3>通暢速　電信局長郁秉堅播講　上海電信事業　本報昨舉行第四次星期播廣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座大中華大陸電台，舉辦第四次星期日特別廣播，請上海電信局長郁秉堅氏播講「上海之電信事業」，茲誌其演詞全文如下：</p>
<p>「上海電信事業」，拿歷史的目光來看，可以分成四個時期：（甲）萌芽時期，（乙）發展時期，（丙）抗戰時期，（丁）復興時期。</p>
<p>萌芽時期</p>
<p>前淸同治十年，距今約七十六年前，丹麥商大北電報公司之海底電報綫，從香港經廈門通至上海，開局營業，起初僅收洋文電報，後來就創編四字號碼華文電報。同時，英商大東電報公司海綫從香港通至上海。光緒六年，北洋通商大臣直隸總督李鴻章奏准開辦天津上海電報，成立電報局，這是上海國營電報事業之始。光緒七年，英商端記洋行在前英租界內創設華洋德律風公司。光緒二十儿年，美商太平洋公司把水綫從馬尼拉經寳由通到上海，設局收發電報。光緒卅年，德國由耶普島（Yap　Island）放水綫到上海。光緒卅二年上海電報局兼辦上海南市閘北電話，設立上海電話局，這是上海國營電話之始。光緒卅四年上海祟明間無綫電報通報。宣統元年上海同海上船舶通報。民國二年日本加設上海長崎間水綫。民國三年吳淞無綫電報局成立。民國十一年上海有廣播無綫電台的設立。</p>
<p>發展時期</p>
<p>民國十六年交通部設電政總局於上海，十七年又歸併入電政司，而把上海電報局列入特等局。同年國民政府在上海設立無綫電機製造廠，並且開辦滬寗長途電話通話。十七年交通部在上海設立電報機器製造廠，以後改爲電信機械製造廠。十八年成立無綫電管理處，把上海作爲全國通信中心，對國內成立各處短波無綫電台，對國際成立國際無綫電台。十九年交通部設立國際電信局及電政同人公益會於上海，同年滬杭長途電話通話。廿四年上海和國內國外試通無綫電話。</p>
<p>抗戰時期</p>
<p>民國廿六年，自抗戰戰事西移，上海的電信機構多從事撤退，把電報局，電話局，國際電台，和大東，大北，太平洋水棧電報收發處，合併爲上海報話局台保管處，派本人在上海主持，開始秘密通信工作。民國廿七年秘密聯絡美商開辦上海美商通訊社，環球無綫電報公司，和新聞無綫電報公司三個機構，直至三十年冬太平洋戰事發生，才被日人侵奪，但少數電信人員仍留上海冒險繼續工作。</p>
<p>復興時期</p>
<p>卅四年六月，本人奉令在上海成立江蘇省江南區電信規復處，作爲勝利時的準備，八月成立京滬區電信接收委員會，奉令接收上海的日僞電信機講。接收以後，維特原有的通信工作，並且把牠逐步的加强和改善。三十四年十一月成立上海電信局，初步整理的工作，才告一段落，此後又成立了電信人員訓練所和電信機料修配所，都是電信局下面分枝機構。</p>
<p>勝利迄今</p>
<p>勝利到現在快一年半了，這時期是初步建設的時期，因機械的簡陋，材料的缺乏，運輸的困難，人才的不足，在在感感覺到牽制困難。現在的電信速窜確較剛接收時進步得多，不能不說是交通部電信總局和本局與各局電信同人努力的結果。目前從上海到各重要城市之有綫電報，無綫電報，有綫電話，無綫電話，已先後開放，國際無綫電話，亦正在試通中。最近本局業務數字統計，來去電報每月平均四十四萬八千九百三十九次，較廿六年時約增加一倍又十分之六。長途電話來去次數，每月平均十四萬七千八百六十次，較廿六年時約增加二倍又十分之七，今後的業務數字，還有繼續上升的趨勢。</p>
<p>工作重心　注意三點</p>
<p>至於一年半來，本局工作的重心，多在電信之「通」「暢」「速」三點上用功夫，未通者求其通，旣通者求其暢，旣暢者求其速。</p>
<p>最後，本人特別提出四點來報吿：（一）整理廣播電台，（A）管理空中秩序，避免擾亂無綫電通信。（B）調節物力，使不致集中一地，而可散佈各地。（C）淘汰粗劣電台，以免影響其他電台。（D）收回廣播事業之主權，勿使外人優越。現本市奉核准參加播音的有十八家，其餘沒有核准的電台，本局遵照交通部命令會同淞滬警備司令部，上海市警察局派員査封，希望今後上海的廣播事榮，能在短時期內納入正軌，完成政府的功令。（二）關於職工差役仍偶有向外界不法的需索，本局除了嚴禁以外，並且隨時注意密査，同時請全市的用戶們，給予我們以有力的協助。凡是碰到以上的事情發生，請用戶注意來人的符號或面貌，秘密通知本局，或則報警拘捕。</p>

<h3>星島離港前夕　一幕精彩演出　一記耳光　打退越南　佛爺兆榮獨取五球</h3>
<p>越南征港足球隊，第三戰與星島賽出由於越隊有前兩戰的優良演出，這次向星島挑戰，球迷「合什」歡迎。</p>
<p>二十二日，細雨飄飄，但銅灣畔，球迷興緻並不因此而低减，滿座依然。</p>
<p>大戰結果，虎隊凈勝五球，在絕對優勢下，越南敗走，開戰的時候，越隊得順風，又慣打濕地球，但由於戰術與及技術遜一籌的原故，前半時竟被星島在逆風局面下，先取三球，於是後半塲的戰情更無足論了。</p>
<p>越南把陣勢略略調整，拍絲尼調充前鋒，（下半塲回充正中衛）希望加强前綫突擊力，但終無效果，而且下半塲越隊僅得十人射「兩脚球」的機會，「神腿」撥與兆榮射入第應戰，當然是更差了！</p>
<p>星島呢，竟成傷愈復出，其他一照平時陣勢，所進五球由「佛爺」兆榮一手包辦，每球都在禁區內起脚，淸脆之至，越門將只有望球興嘆。</p>
<p>五球怎樣進法？接觸的時候，雙方在膠着狀態下面混戰，十五分鐘後，景祥見不是路，立與金海易位，「神腿」親自督師，把敵衛誘出，於是星島機會來了，計所進三球，兩隻是由右邊傳交兆榮射入的，末一球秋亭撥交兆榮，趁勢一蹴而進，反觀越方，無法有一次正式射門機會。</p>
<p>後半時，星島攻勢稍緩，再由景祥挑交兆榮射入第四隻，最後一分鐘內，星島得一個禁區內罰五隻。是日雙方點將。</p>

<h3>港越埠際賽　香港隊先敗後勝</h3>
<p>越南隊旣以三對二敗軍聯，先勝頭陣，二十日正式舉行埠際賽，銅灣畔海軍塲上，球迷大量被吸引，全吿滿座。</p>
<p>大戰前，因爲淋聯陣容堅挺，都料越隊必敗，但戰來竟出意外，港隊前半時，先輸二對零，後半時越隊失了兩隻寃枉球，港聯才得反敗爲勝。老實說，贏得並不淸爽。</p>
<p>依事論實，若談技術，港隊實勝一着，不過演來稍失水準，前鋒兩外將不慣利用左路進攻，所以攻勢雖多，徒作盲衝，無濟於事，能得最後勝利，技術與倖運均有原因。</p>
<p>反觀越隊，演來攻守均妙，能先取兩球，確非偉致，是戰越隊用第一戰陣容出塲，雙方排陣如下：</p>
<p>港聯隊</p>
<p>鮑維路（四二營）侯榕生（星島）謝錦洪（南華）馮坤勝（星島）陳利（約瑟）劉松生（星島）曹秋亭（星島）鄒文治（南華）射錦河（南華）</p>
<p>五時正，軍樂奏過英法國歌後，裁判羅渣士下令開戰，在十五分鐘內，港聯圍門猛攻，越隊腹地頻頻吿險，但不是射高，便是射斜，無法打開紀錄。</p>
<p>十八分鐘時，張胡受騙過陳利，榕生奔前截救，胡受隨即起脚，鮑雜路驟不及防，球雖撲着，仍瀾入欄，港方先負一球。</p>
<p>聯隊反攻，錦河急射被拍出，坤勝遠傳，蕭維路頭頂又越柱而過，久攻不下，越隊得機進軍。</p>
<p>但見胡受，文寳並進，四脚球已到港地禁區，胡受挑球便射，鮑維路欲救無從，港聯再負一隻，二對零完上半塲。</p>
<p>休息後，港聯誓師反攻，四分鐘，沙利雲底綫横掃，球已越門而過，雒料文養救球心切，竟將球踢入網內，演成倒戈，越隊被迫成二比一。</p>
<p>得此轉機後，港隊即盡佔攻勢，但苦無破門機會。</p>
<p>卅二分鐘，又見秋亭沿邊偸進，一脚吊中，沙利雲飛躍衝前，迎勢一頂，球横撇入網，搶成平手。</p>
<p>眼看時間將完，雙方都求力保和局，最後，港聯急攻，球在越隊門前，柏絲尼與門將阮光誤會，不防蕭維路閃進將球一撥，局勢就此決定，三比二，越隊敗得不服氣！</p>

<h3>戰時生長之高等學府　國立師範學院</h3>
<p>— 顏克述</p>
<p>國立師範學院成立，已屆九年，績效如何，諒爲關心敎育人士所注意。爰就所知，簡述如次：</p>
<p>（甲）創辦之艱難與發展之迅速</p>
<p>二十七年七月，敎育部聘廖世承，吳俊升，潘公展，朱經農，汪德耀，爲國立師範學院籌備委員，並以廖世承爲籌備主任。廖氏奉命後，即赴湘選擇院址，幾經勘覓，始擇定安化之藍田鎭。其年十月杪，籌備竣事，部聘廖氏爲院長。時長沙大火，風聲鶴唳，全湘震動，廖氏力持鎭靜，乃於十二月一日正式開學。厥後三四年中，又有長沙常德之多次會戰，藍田密邇戰區，常危疑震撼，不可終日，處境非易，聘人更感困難。然該院於其時竟有驚人之迅速發展，茲臚舉其犖犖大者：（一）院舍之擴充：該院初賃民居李園一幢，及自建敎室數間，與一小操塲。以後逐年添建，共有房屋四十餘幢，地四百餘畝。（二）敎育機構之擴充：初辦時，全院有國文，英語，史地，公民訓育，理化，數學，敎育七系。嗣後逐年分別添設體童專修科，先修班，民敎館（附設民校六所），附屬中學，敎職員子弟小學（附設幼稚園），初級部，音樂專修科，體育師資訓練班，中心及國民學校敎員進修班，體育系，博物系，及敎育資料室（應美國哥倫比亞大學之約，與之交換敎育資料）（三）員生之增加：二十七年度敎職員不滿二十人，學生僅九十餘人。至三十二年度，則院本部，附屬中小學，及民校等，共有敎職員二百五十餘人，學生二千六百人。五年之間，計敎職員增加十餘倍，學生增加二十餘倍</p>
<p>（乙）從容避難與艱貞支持</p>
<p>國立師院發展至卅二年度，擁有七系，四科，三班，及附中，子弟小學，民衆敎育館等龐大機構，規模之宏，駸駸乎與國內之有歷史院校並駕，而是時各系敎授多海內知名舉者，以師範學院言，國內尤無出其右者，於是籌議添設研究所，並招收大學畢業生，開辦第二部，以期成爲一更完全之師範敎育機關，敎育界人士，亦多以此相屬。不意三十三年夏，敵騎南下，長沙不守，該院遂組織戰時服務團，招待國軍及美籍飛行員曁中外避難人士，邵陽中央日報謂「國師已成該地安定力量」，藍田力行日報社論亦謂「抗戰以來，國立大學迫近前綫，屹力不搖者，惟有國立師範學院，動心忍性，不得不謂爲民族之正氣一綫所繫。」迨部陽衡陽相繼淪陷，藍田即處於甕中，敎育部於其時有所指示，該院遂不得不初遷新化，再徙溆浦，因陋就簡，於三十三年十一月二十日開學。遷溆不及一年，員生喘息未定，乃湘西會戰又作，岡書儀器疏散於附近之均坪思蒙二鄉，然課業則未嘗稍輟也。</p>
<p>（丙）抗戰勝利後之遷移</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，敎育復員，國立師院乃以名師薈萃，學風純樸，成績頗著，與國際交換文化等理由，請求改名爲國立中央師範學院，及設置首都區域，或較大都市，俾得光大充實，有以繼往開來，敎育部堅不之許。廖院長卒遵部令，遷移南岳，僅一舊有聖經學院可用，範圍不及藍田五分之一，而復員費合計不過三億餘元，故今後該院之發展，實已大感困難也。</p>
<p>（丁）緬懷過去瞻望未來</p>
<p>（子）院本部學生成績之一斑：（一）參加敎育部主辦各屆全國學業競試，均佔優勝。（二）參加十五屆湖南全省運動會競賽成績，及南岳靑年夏令營考成（有五省二十七校參加），均以該院爲第一。（一）響應靑年從軍運動，逾額甚多。</p>
<p>（丑）畢業生實習生服務成績一斑：（一）該院畢業生及各系實習生，現達六百餘人，服務各級學校者，達百分之九十五。（二）服務處所遍於湘鄂黔贛川滇粵桂閩蘇浙皖陝甘台京滬平渝諸省市，不斤斤於名位，甚得社會獎許。</p>
<p>（寅）樸拙篤厚之學風：（一）硏讀惟勤，守規惟謹，不逐外驚。（二）生活刻苦，故迭經播越，昔茹苦如飴。（三）重道尊師，誠厚懇摯，每於危難之時，軋各盡所能，愛護師長，無微不至。</p>
<p>（卯）附屬中學學生成績之一斑：（一）第一屆畢業生參加湖南省中學會考，與信義中學並列第一。高中畢業生升入著名國立大學人數，達百分之八十以上。（二）軍訓成績及畢業會考成績，均得敎育部嘉獎。</p>
<p>綜上所述，該院自可日益發揚光大，爲我國高等師範敎育樹一楷模。惟該院自遵令遷南岳後，遭遇下列之嚴重困難：（一）院舍不敷，復員費太少。（二）社會經濟，日趨拮据，南岳地小人稠，目前生活程度，較湖南任何區域爲高，延聘師資，至爲困難，然就筆者觀感所及，該院至少有三種足以揮發之力量：（一）廖院長及各敎授明道正誼之精神；（二）樸拙篤厚之傳統學風；（三）校友及學生對敎育事業之志趣與服務熱忱。若我敎育當局能有以改善該院之境遇，並優予扶助，則以該院過去盤根錯節之精神，定能克服一切困難。筆者更望該院仍能「披荊斬棘，履險如夷」，「摩頂放踵，念茲在茲」（廖院長所撰院歌之詞），以建設其輝煌燦爛之前途！</p>

<h3>對於管制紗布轉口　染織棉布　業提供意見</h3>
<p>應求切合實際减少麻煩</p>
<p>染織業及棉布業等對於政院新近所頒行管制辦法，深表憂慮，近三數日間，因海關停止報關較遲，已報關者爭先補進現貨，故市塲尙不乏生氣。但據業中人看來，此僅如廻光反照，轉瞬即熄。且管制辦法，如眞以南運爲例，則手續繁瑣，數量不合事實，業務難免大受打擊。該二業公會之理監事，會數度集會，深感焦灼。前日下午，潘士浩氏因此向紡管會業務處長劉文騰氏探詢管制辦法之方針，並提供同業之意見。據劉氏表示：此事紡管會於事前並無所知，吳市長以兼主任委員之立塲，於奉命後，始責成業務處妥擬計劃，現尙在擬訂中。其要點大致爲（一）紗布二項之轉口，概行管制。惟土紗土布，不在此例。（二）轉口至各地之限額，將以戰前統計爲標準。（三）運商登記手續，將另行擬訂。潘氏當即代表染織及棉布二業，提出意見。（一）管制種類，應减少。如綫呢及花色布疋，決非投機成囤積之目的物。且此種生產廠商，正在困難之中，滯銷存貨，亟待推行，請免予管制。（二）管制基數，請予提高，務使家用及小商販不致受扼。（三）廠商之於本市與外埠間分設工場，其內部須週轉原料製成品，以完成生產順序者，應不受管制。（四）政院頒令以前，已成交者，應儘速准予轉口。（五）轉口向各地之數量，戰前統計，用爲參考固可，依爲標準，則難合事實，紡管會似可侮月或每週每句，定一可以由本市轉口出去之總數量，交由同業公會公開分配。（六）同業公會會員，均應有承辦轉口之資格，無須重辦登記，將來審核這重及　運用與手續。希與同業全會以參加之機會。劉　對此，尙無具體表示。聞染　棉布二全會將另有畫面提交紡管會及市政府云。</p>

<h3>津市嚴查黑銀號　一週破獲十三家</h3>
<p>〔中央社天津廿七日電〕津市當局宣布，近一週來，已有十三家黑銀號被査辦，各黑銀號私行存放款項，利用游資，從事投機，影響物價甚大，市府將繼續查禁。又此間黄金黑市之澈査，邇來日有所聞，廿六日又抄出三陽金店違法收售黄金，據當局宣佈，該號自經濟緊急措施施行後，每日均有黑市交易，且數目甚大</p>
<h3>捲烟公會通告會員　勿任意抬價</h3>
<p>本市捲烟皂獨火柴商業同業公會，昨日通吿各會員云：「查本會同業經營之捲烟。皂·獨火柴等物品，大部份與國計民生有關，凡各交換人不得在市塲內任意抬高市價或代客買賣，以增重民衆負担，早經本會一再通吿嚴禁在案，茲査百物又見飛漲，政府當局正在執行經濟緊急措施政策，嚴厲抑制，務希各交換人一體注意，免受興論之指摘，與法令之制裁。合行通吿一體遵照爲要。」</p>
<h3>燃管會准許煤商　自行採購烟煤</h3>
<p>本市煤產業前曾要求燃管會准予自行採辦煤斤，以疏通來源，茲悉：燃管會對炒煤一項，已准商人自行採運，並經呈准經濟部自即日起施行。茲將該項准許廠商自行購運烟煤辦法摘錄於後：（一）本會供應地區各工廠取煤商如需購用烟煤，除開灤中與淮南華東各礦曁台灣及東北各省煤礦外，其他各地區所產烟煤，得由各工廠或煤商向本會或本會南京辦事處申請，自行購運。惟准許自行購運地區應以不抵觸當地燃料管制辦法爲限。（二）准許自行購運地區，如經濟部認爲有管理必要時，另行公吿停止購運（三）各工廠或煤商申請自行購運煤，一經核准後，由本會發給准許自行購運烟煤證明書，持往指定地區購運，運到南京或上海後，如需轉遲他地，應報請本會騐明，發給運煤證後，准予通行。（四）申請領證之工廠須繳騐主管機關核發之登記證，及最近用煤設備表產品數量表，曁該業問業公會證明，以憑審核。（五）工廠每次申請購運數量，以不超過該工廠一個月實需數量爲準，但每月需要數量在五十噸以下者，得一次購足兩個月之用款。（六）本會核准自行購運之燃煤，得由各工廠聯合購運，如各該廠不能自行購運時，得申述理由，委託煤商代爲瞞運，但須於申請時，備呈委託據送核。（七）煤商申請自行購運烟煤，暫以每一商號每月購運一百噸爲限，並應由各該商號取具所屬公會證明，送請本會發給准許自行購運烟煤證明書。（八）烟煤運到後，應持同產地礦塲所發售煤證件，或礦產稅票，報請本會査騐。如有超過核准購運之數量，其超過部份，由本會依照收購價格收購之。（九）本辦法自呈奉經濟部核准公佈之日起實行云。</p>
<h3>皖南桐油槪况</h3>
<p>— 曹思濱</p>
<p>桐油在皖南的地位，不及茶葉來得重要，不過因爲皖南的山多，而且土壤氣候也都適宜於植桐，假使能由政府積極提倡，那末推進一定容易，而收效也必宏大。</p>
<p>皖南產桐油區域，以寗國，貴池爲大宗。其次是至德，休寗，歙縣，祁門，石埭，涇縣，旌德，績溪，宣城等地；同時郞溪，廣德一帶，荒地很多，頗可加以開墾，改植桐樹。</p>
<p>皖南桐油在過去並無獨立的地位，貴池一帶所產的都經由股家匯運往南京，供作內銷。休寗，歙縣一帶所產，因爲品質較高，所以往往經杭州油商轉銷上海，以供外銷。不過因其產量較少，所以一般往往只知道是浙產桐油，而忽略了是皖南所產。至於皖南桐油的品質，依照貿易委員會在戰時的收購成績來說，尙較隣省爲高。油度通常都在一五一七〇至　一五一八〇度之間。而且所含的酸價，又很低，確實很適合外銷的標準。其年產量約爲五萬市担。但實際的數字，據一般熟悉內情者談，當在六萬至七萬市祖。由此看來，皖南桐油實在很有發展的餘地。問題僅是在怎樣去鼓動植桐風氣，及政府之提倡與輔導。</p>
<p>皖南桐油產量表</p>
<p>宣城　二三七市担</p>
<p>寗國　一〇·〇四六市担</p>

<p>因此，像懷瓦明這樣的省份，永遠是一個冷靜的局面。他們的社會，是寗靜安祥的，物價比東部低得多，比西岸也低得多，我在向園街上慢步，呼吸着淸靜自由的空氣，覺得有一種無上的安逸，向園有一張報紙，懷瓦明論壇報，日出兩大張，他自稱有十萬讀者。</p>
<p>我旁聽了懷瓦明的省參議會，那天，議員先生們正熱烈討論着省級公務員的『加薪』問題，省長沒有在座，省政府的提案，是平均由年薪三千六百元，增加到四千二百元。議員們大部份是贊成的，一位禿頂的省參議員主張複査省府的預算。</p>
<p>一個從蘇聯歸來的牧師布蘭福，懷瓦明的『英雄』，被許多聽衆們歡呼着，他在『浸信會』的敎堂中演講，證明『蘇俄是一個無上帝無宗敎的禽獸國家』。仙還報吿了許多在蘇聯的見聞。如今能够進入蘇俄去，再平安歸來的人，都成了美國民間崇拜的英雄！</p>
<p>燦爛雙十　與登佛爾有關</p>
<p>這樣，我便匆匆忙忙到了科羅拉圖省，汽車從向園向南直奔，是通達科毗鄰垃國的康莊大道。三小時平坦的旅行，走在落磯山的東麓，朝陽一抹，照射着巍峨的落磯出巔。</p>
<p>我應該仔細介紹一下登佛爾，中國地圖上譯作丹佛爾，科羅拉圖的省城，『落磯山帝國』的首府，也是國父孫中山先生孕育革命理論的所在地。這個發音Denver的地名，應該改譯登佛爾，美國人相當討厭類如『魔鬼』Devil，稱他作『丹佛爾』。</p>
<p>前年慶祝雙十節國慶的時候登佛爾市長有過一篇演講，他的大意是說：中國雙十節的燦爛的革命，和登佛爾有極密切的關聯，因爲孫逸仙博士的革命理論，革命思想，是在登佛爾稱成的。市長的演辭中還有更離奇的一段。他說：一九一一年武昌起義的時候，孫逸仙博士正在登佛爾一家餐館中當『西崽』，（註：在美國職業觀念平等的社會中，道句話並沒有半點侮辱的意味）。有一天，孫博士在餐廳中接到電報，知道革命不但爆發，而且各省饗應，果眞成功了，他趕緊脫下制服，丢下板盤，奔到馬路上，兩手亂鄉，大呼：中國革命成功了！『那時候，我們登佛爾的人，還沒有怎樣了解中國，許多人看見孫博士，都莫名其妙』！</p>
<p>在圖書館　研究革命學說</p>
<p>這不過是演辭中的一段，全篇演講，對中國都很同情和友好。我在登佛爾一個星期，非常留神的探聽國父當年革命的軼事，而且還特地訪問了市長史丹潑頓先生，市長第二天約我便餐，席問，他說：他雖然年已古稀，市長也當了十五年，但是當年他跟中山先生並不熟識，因爲據他知道：中山先生在登佛爾的時候，大部份時間，都在圖書館裏硏究革命的學說。中山先生的演講，多半是對中國華僑演的，他也沒有機會聽訓，我問他前年雙十節演講的內容，他說忘了，因爲演講稿是他的秘書寫的，他就是那麽念一遍而已！</p>
<p>溫莎旅館　國父當年居處</p>
<p>史丹潑頓市長跟幾個老華僑很熟：胡和惠，胡和蓁，『廣東餐館』和『重慶樓』的老闆。我後來又詳細和一位年靑僑領黄國光君談過，黄君說：國父當年常常住在登佛爾，那是事實，但做西崽，則絕無其事，因爲那時候，同盟會已經成立，國父領導全盤革命大計，經濟上不需要靠當西息維持生活，時間上也沒有餘閒從事『副業』。黄國光說：據他所知：中山先生那時候常常住在拉雷墨街的一家呌做溫莎旅館裏，那時候，登佛爾還是一個小城市，南半城根本沒有開發，拉雷墨街在東京城，那兒比較的繁榮。</p>
<p>黄國光現在開設着一家『新中國』飯店，他工作勤懇，做人謙和，因此，他雖然把飯館開在城南』『政治區』，他的營業，非常鼎盛。</p>
<p>十五號街　訪中美俱樂部</p>
<p>後來，我訪問到登佛爾的『中美俱樂部』，第十五號街九百十五號，那是一個戰時的產物。戰時，中國空軍大批來登佛爾受訓，爲了安慰這些年靑的小夥子的異鄉寂寞，成立了這個俱樂部，一位五十多歲的美國老小姐，范丁，是俱樂部的管理人，她替我介紹許多中國朋友，她說：她和中國人保持友好，有四十年悠長的歷史，因爲中國人誠實，講道義。牠從來沒到過中國，也不會說中國話。</p>
<p>她說：中山先生在登佛爾住得很久，而且常常在市集街Market　St.二〇一五號一座樓房中演講革命，有一次，她也跟僑胞們一起聽過，但是中山先生並沒認識她。她說：如今這座樓房尙在，由一位名呌愛倫的老太太管理着。</p>
<p>我在二〇五號門前徘徊甚久，屋子緊緊鎖着，看樣子現在是『華僑會館』，愛倫老太太不在，我白跑上一趟。</p>
<p>不同類型　華僑可分三種</p>
<p>登佛爾的中國人，正在慢慢忘掉前一代的掌故，年靑的一代，正在生氣蓬勃的站起來了。在登佛爾的中國人，大概可以歸納爲三個不同的類型：廣東籍華僑，工程師；航空員。我在海關大廈二樓，會見資源委員會派在登佛爾的代表徐懷雲先生，他是揚子江發電廠在登佛爾設計的總負責人。徐說：設計工作是和美國　殖總局合作進行的，由資源委員會委託墾殖局設計，設計人員中，中美工程師各半。</p>
<p>我會見好幾位在　殖總局工作的年靑工程師，他們有朝氣，有理想，也有抱負。墾殖總局主管美國西部十七個州的水利灌漑工程，這是一個當今中國最需要的，眞正替老百姓做事的機關。</p>
<p>中國受訓空軍　八月間訓練期滿返國</p>
<p>在中美俱樂部，我碰見中國空軍在美受訓隊的翻譯官兼英語敎官『彼得吳』，吳崇眞先生，他從戰時就來到美國，偕同著空軍健兒們到處轉輾遷徙，因爲訓練種類的不同，地點的不同，一隊受訓人員，常常今天在這兒，明天又開拔到那兒，他說：現在在登佛爾附近訓練的，大約還有XX人，他們學過偵察，轟炸，雷達，航空製造等等。因為他們成績好，很受訓練營主任LOWE將軍的賞識。據吳崇眞說：今年八月間，全部訓練期滿，大家便要回中國去，以後是否還有人派來？那就很難說了。</p>
<p>中國陰曆元且，登佛爾的空軍營中，有一個盛大的慶祝，登佛爾城裏，也有非常熱鬧的塲面。可惜的是：華僑人數太少，『一年不比一年了』、范丁老小姐非常感愴。</p>
<p>我應該引一點歷史的掌故，說明科羅拉圖省和中國僑胞的關係。科羅拉圖是落磯山中最主要的一州，美國南北戰爭以前，還是紅印第安人的天下，白人雖然有，但袛是少數。南北戰爭爆發的那年，眼光遠大的林肯統，爲拉攏西方的合作，派了第一任戰時總督吉爾實將軍到登佛爾，這情形，像民國二十八年以前，西康省政府成立以前，有點相仿，省　機構雖未確立，但已經有了『省』的雛型，吉爾賓將軍於一八六一年二月底，到登佛爾，到一八七六年八月一日，科羅拉圖才正式『建省』完成。至今科羅拉圖的省參議會門前，有吉爾賓將軍的銅像。</p>
<p>據說：第一個白種人進入科羅拉圖的，名字呌做『拉塞爾』，他是爲採金而來，從肯薩斯州跋涉到科羅拉圖，和紅印第安人發生血戰，那是在一八五八年。</p>
<p>建省以前　華僑大量湧來</p>
<p>華僑到科羅拉圖，還是「建省』以前的事，大約在一八六五年前後，最早的『開國元勳』呌做陳玲樹（譯音），那時候，因爲南北戰爭訓完，美國大量修　鐵路，陳玲樹負責招募華僑鐵路工人。一八七〇年的時候，在登佛爾一地的華僑鐵路工人，達三千名之多，鐵路修成以後，很多留在登佛爾，慢慢的，慢慢的，每年都有人『回唐』，回去的多，來的少，到現在袛勝下一百五十人。范丁老小姐講得很感愴，她說：這些華僑，信仰基督敎的不太多，但是，他們都有一顆善良的心！</p>
<p>工業起家　中國學生習鑛</p>
<p>登佛爾大學以鑛冶工程著名，中國學生習鑛冶的也不少，許多人畢業了，都預備馬上回去，有幾位預備去東北開　，他們關心東北的安危。資源委員會的工程師，設計揚子江水閘的，大約也有幾十位，他們的設計工作，還有一二年。徐懷雲氏說：當初資源委員會跟美國墾殖局訂的委託合同，是中國應付給設計費五十萬美元，截至目前為止，已經付了二十萬元。</p>
<p>科羅拉圖是一個以工業起家的省份，特別是冶金，水利，以及與水利有關的電力工業和墾殖萊。我對登佛爾省城，有一種勤奮而富有朝氣的即象，處處給人一種生氣蓬勃的感覺。</p>
<p>我參觀了省參議會，造幣廠，和兩家報館。造幣廠在城南一座精緻的建築內，因爲科羅拉圖出產金銀，每年鑄成的貨幣，達三千多萬元。</p>
<p>兩家報館　全省與論權威</p>
<p>登佛爾有兩家報館：登佛爾郵報，全省的輿論權威，日出五版，日銷約二十萬份，是一個非常賺錢的報紙，創辦人是義大利籍的美國人龐飛爾，如今　飛爾死了，一部份股票，已經售出。　飛爾的女兒海倫，現在是報館的財務主任。現任的董事長是康必耳，總編輯麥凱尼。</p>
<p>落磯山帝國新聞報是霍華磯系的報紙，四開不型銷數約十萬份，主持人是福斯特，新聞編輯是凱塞爾，他們和華盛頓霍華總總編輯部有電訊聯繫，社論等等都是華盛頓拍來的。</p>
<p>認識中國　是首要的課題</p>
<p>兩個報紙都有外勤記者來訪問我，並且都刋出了我的照片和新聞。他們對中國有興趣，但是，他們對中國了解得太少。他們把爲歇爾國務卿看成『聖賢』，他們認爲古往今來，馬歇爾是唯一的了解中國的人。</p>
<p>我到登佛爾的第二天有一個納伐達的參議員，從華盛頓回納伐達，路經登佛爾，在那兒演講，他反對借債給任何外國，對中國的借款談判，應該停止。許多美國朋友，問我的意見，我大有『一部二十四史，不知從何說起』之苦，我覺得怎樣使美國內地的人民，了解中國，認識中國，是當前横亘在中美兩國之間最重要的課題！</p>
<h3>瘡裏化膿的蘇北</h3>
<p>— 孑遺</p>
<p>蘇北廿日快訊</p>
<p>蘇北這一片廣大平原，旣不是蒙疆的沙漠之區，也不比陜北荒瘠之地，地位居全國行政與商業的重心，南京與上海的旁邊，他的安危，直接的影響着京滬的安全，間接的牽動到全國的大局！他更爲中共視爲唯一的「糧倉」，爲他們在軍略上與政略上必爭之地。自政府在那邊開始「綏靖」以來，起初中共倒也很具戒心，恐怕這一着的來勢不小，難於招架得住；所以在一個綏靖的初期階段中，他們的確除了用「精兵减政」，「化整爲零」的方式，减少掉不少目標以外，在幾處的點與綫一帶，他們也部暫行放棄了。可是爲時未久，他們看：「山人妙計，不過爾爾，」便又自許多的角落裏，漸漸復活起來了。</p>
<p>膿毒來勢頗不輕　有席捲全面之勢</p>
<p>負着綏靖與保安責任的長官，經過了若千月日的努力，在幾條主要的交通綫上，總算是給打通了；住在交通綫上，和幾個城市據點中的人民，以及自鄉間逃避到城市中來的人民，他們原來是過着天天受着熬煎，夜夜睡在田野的生活，如今忽然得重入了政府的懷抱快樂與興奮的心情，當然是難於形容的。可是長官們是當在交通綫上禁衛森嚴之中行走着，很少深入民間去巡訪的機會，他們在外表上看看，城市中居然戲院，酒館，無綫電，霓虹燈，交織成了一幅十分昇平的）氣象，便說，蘇北的共匪已肅淸了，綏靖的大業已完成了。政府根據這些官方報吿，以及若千視察人員，只能在城市中受些歡宴，公路上坐坐汽車，而製成的「視察實錄」，也就認爲蘇北果然已經太平無事了，就把許多國軍調往了別處。這麽一來，中共憑他們詳密的情報，就又給了他重張旗鼓的機會，再加此刻又正是鄉間麥高草茂之時，更是他們活動反攻的最好時機；所以近月餘來，這個表面已似乎收了口的瘡，裏面又在化膿；而這股膿毒，却來勢不輕，大有席捲全軀之勢！可是「醫生」却好像把他忽視了！</p>
<p>城裏清議進行中　鄉鎭據點丟不得</p>
<p>目下的蘇北，自淮河黃河故道以南，直到長江北岸，這一個被中共所稱爲「蘇中軍區」的重要「糧倉」，在我們的軍政設施上，幾乎成了一個眞空地帶。第一綏靖區的負責長官，過去雖也確曾在這地帶盡了不少力量，無奈軍事與政治仍缺少切實的配合，政治與民衆又沒有發生密切的連鎖，負軍事責任的人說：「政治重於軍事，我們旣把共匪打跑了，你們就該好好地去幹。」負行政現任的人又說：「共匪雖暫時跑開一步，但武力依然未滅，國軍一去，他們又來了！自衛隊只够捉捉小偸，我們赤手空拳，怎麼推動得下去！」各有各的理由，都沒有說錯；錯仍錯在軍事政治的缺乏切實的配合，軍令政令的未能澈底的貫澈；而風紀的蕩弛，上下的欺矇，尤爲最大的廠結！最近在綏靖司令部所在地的南通境內，一連失掉了三餘鎭溢港橋兩個重要據點，就都是在城裏的軍政長官議論紛紜，互相忌諱的局面之下，而相繼地丢了的。這兩處的自衛隊有四百餘人，都是當地過云受盡了共軍擾害，而自動參加米服務的優秀靑年；搶械彈藥也全是他們自己節衣縮合　產吿貸而艱辛購得的，他們決不再敢受共軍欺騙了，所以一遭攻擊，就自動地在軍民一致堅決抗禦之下，日以繼夜的拚命奮鬥着。可是結果都同樣地因爲得不着一點接濟，在彈盡援絕，流盡了最後一滴血以後，就都給共軍用機槍與刺刀全數殺盡了！鄰近的鄉鎭自衛隊和人民，「兎死狐悲」，向政府來紛紛申訴，政府的長官都一樣地安慰他們說”不要妄信流言，自相驚擾；政府自有萬全之計。「山人自有道理，」人民不敢多問，惟有回去在食不甘味寢不安枕的狀况下，且再慢慢地過着一天算是一兩個半天的延捱的日子。</p>
<p>蘇北究值幾文錢　試來一點小統計</p>
<p>在安居江南福地的人們眼光中，似乎對那遠隔一條大江，而爲車夫苦力等輩出生之地的「江北」，一向就不大把他放在心上。因爲那邊旣無比美天堂的蘇杭，又無崇樓傑閣的京滬；把他放在政府懷抱裏也好，暫時給他受點摧殘，似乎也無關大體。生長在那裏的同胞，沒有畢挺的西裝可穿，沒有高深的知識可求，就只好有如被遺棄的孤兒一般，紛紛流落到四方，做些車夫苦力的工作！然而那邊却有着鉅大數量的出產，爲住居福地的人們所不可一日或缺；他更替國家爭取得鉅大的經濟資源。我們除掉一日不可缺少的雞，鴨，蛋，肉，以及麥，豆，棉籽，苞米，和價　質堅的土布等物品，大多是自蘇北取得以外；尤其主要的紡織原料棉花，蘇北每年以往更就賓凈棉五百萬担的產量，足供紡錠一百七十萬枚之需；而品質最優的美棉，在蘇北也有近一百萬担的生產。而兩淮的食鹽，更給國庫增加了很大的收大。如果把這些生產物資來一個統計，他所給予國家與社會的利益，決非都市中表面五色繽紛而實際消耗多於生產者可比！中共把這裏看得比我們更淸楚，所以無論怎探，都不肯把這個倉庫輕易地放棄了；然而我們對於這條只顧擠他的奶汁而不給他保養食息的母牛，却爲什麼還這般的漠視着呢？</p>
<p>大家都說為人民　人民却大夹缝中</p>
<p>生在今日蘇北的人民，其生活的痛苦，非身歷其境者，斷難於想像！一些坐在高樓大廈，高喚「到民間去」，擠著「民主大旗」的前進先生，看了幾本民主博士的論文，就五體投地的高聲附和着，如果仙們有胆量，背親自跑到蘇北的真正民間去實地勾留一下，（城市中和汽車裏，是看不出什麼實情的。）我相信他們的「前進」思想，立刻就會動搖的不知到什麽地方去。生在這裏的人民，在「三資」，「鬥爭」，「淸算」，「翻身」，許多花式之下，時他進退兩難，哭笑不得！，不逃亡，固然是死，逃亡又只能深夜空手而出，前路茫茫，又何以茍延殘喘？即幸而逃入政府的治下，又每易給人疑心他是奸細，而逼得他無處容身！鄉間的田地荒廢了，無人去種，也無心去再勞苦；跑入城市，又無工作可做！純良端正的人，給到處給烏烟瘴氣總昏了，恨不得找個寺廟去做和尙；奸狡貪汚之帶，就正好在渾水裏大撈一把！到處是虎狼成羣，不見天日；大家却又都同樣地高呼着，是僞了人民；而純良的人民，就都給擠在夾縫之中，吃盡了上夾棍下汕鍋之苦！在這個局勢之下，更還有誰高興去勞動，去生產？不如大家袖手延捱，引頸待斃。「時日盍喪！」又該待讓去拯救呢？</p>
<p>綏靖工作如救火　餘燼不滅必復燃</p>
<p>如今在一運串「蘇北匪勢蠢動」，「魯南共軍亟謀南竄」的消息之中，第一緩靖區正開着一個重要的綏靖會議，參加這會議的有李默菴司令，省政府的負責長官，區保安司令，各縣縣長，和軍事科長；我們相信這個會議的使命是異常的重大，也就更希望他的決議，將有更大的成就。不過就我們在蘇北的鄉間，經過了幾個月的實地考察，以及過去長時期住居在那裏的經騐，認爲淸剿工作，單定出幾條口號還是不够的，懲前毖後，還須做到下面的幾個要點；</p>
<p>一，必須配置足够佈置澈底淸剿的正規軍力，不要估敵過輕，而把無法負起的任務，硬放到力量有限的自衛隊身上去，徒使人民犧牲，於事無補。</p>
<p>二，政府要扶植自衛隊的長成，更要愼重自衛與保甲人員的人選；自有自新份子，過於優待放任，不僅失了人民的向心力，並日易於引起無窮的後患。</p>
<p>三，政治不易上軌道，根本原於匪患的未能澈底消滅，故目前仍應置軍事於第一。果得淸剿成功，人民得有保障，好人自願出任行政自治工作，政令自易推行無阻；農工各業得入常軌，地方財力自充，百廢自可易舉。</p>
<p>四，蘇北情况，旣尙與汀南迴異，各種政令推行，政府不宜削足過履，益增民困；應針對蘇北現實，因地制宜，另定法規，勿徒以「事關通案」，知其不可而强爲之，益苦人民！追徽三十五年度田賦，徴兵，徴所利得各稅，……在百孔千瘡嗷嗷待哺的蘇北地區，都有重加檢討之必要。</p>
<p>五，人民的唯一要求，只是希望「安居樂業」；中共兩年前黨行小惠於人民，人民中了他的計的不少！後來拖出了殺人放火的尾巴，大家就恨之入骨，有待政府拯救，甚於飢渴。今後一切設施，必須眞正爲人民福利着想，勿使人民失望。</p>
<p>六，各階層自治與自衛人員，應嚴加訓練，肅正紀律，加强力量，明定獎懲。對國民敎育，更應重視，以增進人民的學識，道德，與是非的判別力。</p>
<p>我們檢討過去的蘇北綏靖工作，不能說他的成就不大；收復了的城市和交通綫，確也很不在少；只因那些躱在鄉僻間的餘燼，還未把他完全撲滅掉，鄉民因無保障，不敢進城去報吿；城市的情報，又辦的未臻靈活正確；就把鄉村的許多角落忽視了，以致給那些餘燼，又有了復燃的機會！我們懷於「星星之火，可以燎原；涓涓不塞，將成江河」之古訓，更希學這次當局的淸剿工作，更須力求其「迅速」，「切實」，與「澈底」！蘇北是中共的「糧倉」，他得之可保其餉精於不　；蘇北更是京滬的屛藩，我如失之，京滬就斷難獨全！</p>

<h3>西湖留痕</h3>
<p>— 對潔</p>
<p>十八日杭州訊</p>
<p>杭州旅客，大致可分爲「遊湖」與「燒香」兩種，而以遊湖者為最我。船伕們把握着這個良機，「三冬靠一春」的俗語，他們無疑問要實踐一下，不僅是呌船貴，連其他的物價也隨之上昇，幾乎超出市價數借以上。這是道道地地的「刨黄瓜兒」。上月問，划一天船只需一萬八千元，頂多兩萬四千元，最近確由四萬，八萬，十二萬，乃至莫明其妙的跳到十六萬。遊湖以取樂爲目的，花幾個錢不在乎，何必和船伕計較？一個要補鍋，一個鍋拿來種，「黄瓜兒」你不做誰去做？</p>
<p>不做雙料黃瓜兒</p>
<p>遊湖興緻已罷，目標鞠入附近山區，如虎跑，玉皇山，六和塔，靈隱等地，這時就是汽車，三輪事與黄包車的世界，假使你有自備汽車帶去，或者由當地友人借部汽車，那是例外，普遍遊客又逃不掉做一次一黄瓜兒」。你打電話呌汽車，問他廿分鐘多少錢，他準定回你沒有車子，你若改換口氣，說「到某某地方一部車子多少錢？」那麼他一定回答你：「車子是有，不過價錢要若干若干，」這樣討價還價，保險不成問題，三輪車與黄包車就看人色說話，你要能够堅持，雖然是被仙刨黄瓜兒，但也不致於吃大虧。到達目的地上山，車子不能再上山，有轎于可坐，一關一關又一關，這是橋伕的關卡，他們依舊不敖鬆「刨黄瓜兒」的機會，通常上出轎子的代價，是包括來回的。倘使一頂橋子兩萬元，你給他四萬元，便上了當，因爲你是做了雙料「黄瓜兒」了！</p>
<p>一些好奇的遊客，專門到樓外樓，太和園，王潤興等聞名的大飯店吃飯，他們認爲這幾家店酒菜好，不能放過嘗試的機會。其實，又做了「黄瓜兒」，樓外樓名字好聽，菜却只有醋溜魚最好。王潤興店老聲勢大，一共有好幾家，菜也僅僅「魚頭豆腐」與「家鄉南肉」兩種出名，當然，竹　街老店稱眞牌子。太和園一般人認爲很貴，實際上價錢比樓外樓便宜。所有的菜僅「搶蝦」較好。至於杭州土產，如龍井茶葉，張小泉剪刀，王星記扇子，西湖傘等等，也沒有什麼道理。遊客的心理，一方面是紀念，一方面是餽贈，最低限度表示他到過杭州。遊客的心理，商人們便落得「刨黃瓜兒」。</p>
<p>六和塔踏上一半</p>
<p>申報副總編輯兼復旦敎授卜少夫，劇作家田漢，吳天，名導演應雲南，他們也曾趕到杭州凑熱鬧，可就忙壞了申報駐杭特派員儲裕生。有一天，他們同道至六和塔遊覽，由儲先生及浙贛鐵路會專員導遊，六和塔有十三層之高，但到六層就止步，無路可再上，六和塔上江水，這幾們文化人的靈感頃刻流露，少夫先生還說了一個笑話：「記得幾年前有三對新婚夫婦，特地跑到六和塔舉行婚禮，以求吉利，結果，這三對夫婦，死的死，離的離，都演成了悲劇，原因是只知「六和」，而忘記最後一個「塔」字，所以要分離，」大家聽後，都大笑不止。「野獸野獸野獸」的作者無名氏，在放鶴亭吃茶時，對六和塔之美也與彼等同感。他說：「站在六和塔上看錢江大橋及錢塘江，其美勝過遊西湖。」</p>
<p>從杭州談好萊塢</p>
<p>從六和塔過去一里路，就是之江大學，校舍並不算頂好，自然環境似可與淸華媲美。之江大學王秘書領導參觀，並解說「靈芝草」與「情人橋」的來歷，王先生愈說愈起勁。最後，他與我們的藝人建議，將該處作爲中國的好萊塢，應震衛首先表示贊同。一位記者表示異議，說：「好萊塢沒有感什麽好，難道中國自己不能創造一個比好萊塢更好的電影公司嗎？」一陣舌戰在大家默默無語中結東。</p>
<p>三日晚上，杭市文化團體四單位，假靑年館舉行歡迎田漢，卜少夫，應雲衛，吳天等座談茶會，由儲裕生致開會詞，與會者甚爲踴躍，約有兩百餘人，渠等次第講演。輪對卜先生最後一個講聽衆仍無倦容。次日，某報載：「卜少夫先生說，美國有一家報紙，不登廣吿，維持了十四年。一位中學生很欽佩卜先生見多識廣，他只知道美國有一「下午報」，沒有廣吿支撑六年半，而從不知道一家廿四年者。」卜先生看到這張報紙，微笑了一下，說：「這一位學生眞太天眞可愛了！」</p>
<p>一個寳貴的春遊季節，快消逝過去了，但遊客們逸興還濃厚如常。一批去了，一批又來。不斷的來，不斷的去。</p>

<p>近來本市火警之多，爲前所未有，雖聞另有別因，面在房荒嚴重聲中，臨時建築物之汎濫，實亦重要原原因之一，茲條陳意見數點如後：（一）請市府撥租郊外公地，指定爲建築棚戶地區，（二）請警察局嚴厲取締無照動工建築、（三）請區公所注意棚戶之戶口移動，（四）請工務局規定棚戶建築設備之最低條件，（五）被災棚戶，除勸令遷往撥定地點外，不准在原地起造。又南市萃　弄，東通裏馬路，西接豆市街，住戶衆多，該弄滿堆垃圾，夜間缺少路燈，汚穢黑暗，不堪言狀，並請市政當局注意改善。（建築師蔡吉人）</p>

<p>民主作風</p>

<h3>惜餘春續記—揚州續夢之十五</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>筆省前記惜餘春實僅一個輪廓，餘事可記者尙多。</p>
<p>高駝子名乃超。先創可可居，虧蝕後方縮小爲惜餘春。在可可居時代，又可分先後兩個階段。先在敎塲兩頭，今春園附近，後移敎塲中段，今月明軒地址。先不甚大，後則丈輪美奐，到了惜餘春時代，便覺窘相畢露。先大外祖曾有詩云。『半間矮屋（一作兩間酒店）且容身，除却駝翁俗了八；寫上靑帘太悽絕，銷魂三字惜餘春。』可謂感慨系之。</p>
<p>不過當可可居時代，駝翁却在『雜揚細點』方面留下了不可磨滅的偉績。在昔揚州點心，均用大龍，至可可居才改用小節。墊籠昔用松毛，可可居又改用白布。雖然近來依舊用松毛的多，取其有淸香，可是用白布墊寵，却爲駝翁所創始。不但此也，所謂千層油糕以及翡翠稍麥（稍麥亦名鬼蓬頭，見揚州畫舫錄。近時茶社裏寫成燒賣，實誤。）也是他所發明。千層油糕，各地揚州點心店都以此號召顧客，因其爲他地所無。至於翡翠稍麥，即菜稍麥，是甜的，與鹹的米稍麥相比，別是一般滋味。喫揚州點心者如袛知千層油糕，而不知翡翠稍麥，就口福上說，總是一件遺憾的事。</p>
<p>駝翁在開設可可居時代，麵點生意蹙極一時，到了惜餘春時代，就不能再賣麵點。開始還自製一些滷菜及醬豆等賣賣，後來該是因爲資本愈過愈少，連滷菜醬豆也不能再賣，這才賣賣炒肉絲燒豆腐之類。仙的心地特別純良，顧客要記賬，總是不好意思拒絕。後來爲了資金短絀，也會遲疑一下，可是顧客如說到『你怕我不還錢嗎？』便更不好意拒絕。欠脹旣愈記愈多，現金自愈用愈少，虧蝕遂爲必然的結果。那些在可可居以及惜餘春記賬的落拓文人，過後也有環境好轉起來的，却依然不想還賬，幷且也不再到惜餘春去了。當駝翁在街上遇見這些人時，必是遠遠的就掉轉頭去。有人問其原因，他說：『免得人家頂面見到我難爲情。』</p>
<p>在可可居以及惜餘春的老茶客中雖有若干人袛知記賬，不想還賬，辜負了心地純良的主人，可是另有一位使主人感奮之人，那便是追隨多年的伙計胡三。當主人閉歇了可可居時，別人都作各奔東西的打算，而胡三却回鄉賣掉自已僅有的幾畝田，爲主人增加資金，他說：『我的主人爲了好客　蝕了資金，我也可爲了好客的主人賣却自家的田地』</p>
<p>先大外祖謂『除却駝翁俗了人』。駝翁之不俗，就在淺於名利，同時還能自得其樂，不以自家處境日漸艱苦爲意。他能一面在櫃檯裏面揀着蔬菜，一面低聲吟哦着，還不時和顧客們很幽默的鬥趣。下面所說，便是一例。友人汪二丘，善奕棋，當時亦是惜餘春顧主之一。他家住十三灣，因自號，『十三灣裏人。』另有郭某住城外念四橋，號念四橋顧客。一日，汪君剛要離開惜餘春門，郭某恰好來了，正在櫃極裏的駝翁便高呼汪君留步，笑謂：『適得一聯請敎。』汪君問聯語，駝翁說：『眼前事不正是一副極佳的對聯？「十三灣裏人才去念四橋頭客又來。」』一時汪君與郭某均不禁撫掌。原來駝爲已使自家的生活趣味化，可以在艱苦的境地中，依然能覓得趣味，於是也就樂在其中。惜餘春櫃檯上的站牌上是吉亮工寫的『人生行樂」四字，想來駝翁是很能體會到『人生行樂』之意義的。</p>
<h3>我所聽到的音樂</h3>
<p>— TC</p>
<p>——藝徒生涯漫憶</p>
<p>當一個盛大的音樂會奏完最後一個音符時，熱烈的Fncore掌聲和在台下騷動着,音樂家含着微笑頻頻向他的聽衆鞠躬致謝，絲絨的厚幕終於徐徐地降下，聽衆也含着滿意的情緒散出會塲</p>
<p>演奏家和聽衆們回到家裏後，他們所談論的大半是關於演奏的成敗，誰和誰在塲，誰穿什麽衣服，明天報上有什麼批評的預測等等，至於他曾演奏的音樂，他們似乎都不很注意，我們從音樂會裏得來的，是一種社交的經騐，那也是一種藝術，可是不必算作間樂的藝術。</p>
<p>音樂曾在斗室中，暗角喪，雨大和夏夜給我們一種無可言喩的感受，它的聲音，曾使我的心弦起過共鳴，它滋潤了我的靈魂，使我深深地認識藝術家心的深處，它是無比的溫暖和愉快。你要是有一顆樸素無華的心，你將引我的話爲知言。</p>
<p>夏天，是浪漫的季節。夏夜的凉風習習地吹向我們時，浪漫的心情便充滿了幻想。幾個朋友，踏着輕鬆的步子，走到台斯德朗路雲裳邨—我們一個好朋友的家，馬君和他的姊妹們的家，說實話，早上到他家去是有些頭痛的，馬君在樓下練着小提參，也許有初學的生徒在他室內奏着練習曲，隔室是他姐姐彈鋼琴，多半是急速艱深的樂曲，他的妹妹還在樓上吹笛子，那一大堆的樂聲會引起鄰人們不少次的干涉，跑進他們家，使人聯想起早晨的小菜塲。可是晚上——夏天的晚上，我的記憶永磨不掉那時一般的情調，他家的門前玫瑰開遍了矮籬笆，花的影子遮滿了馬小姐的窗，她的弟妹們都已停止喧鬧時，姚在不太明亮的燈光下（前幾年節電是很認眞的）在最富幻想的樂器——鋼琴上，彈着Chopin的Etude。旋律像一個女郞在抽噎，她披着長髮，訴着她的戀情；和弦像夜來香一般地芳馥，它沉醉了少年們的心。我們在她的窗前竊聽，也許我的眼圈曾潤濕過不少次，我們輕輕地互相說：「眞美呵」！那些Etudes對於我是太熱悉了，每學期音樂院的考試節目上，都曾聽過數十百遍，Eriedman和Godowsky灌的笛聲機片在每家客廳裏重複地演奏着，可是我僅僅追憶着她披着輕紗像夢一般的彈跳奏。</p>
<p>Chopln，一個溫柔多情的名字，他是屬於靑年情侶的。同學朱女士在學校大廳上練習她的大考節目——A大調Ballada，她的男友陳君和我倚在琴凹中傾聽。陳君爲她講說這Ballade的故說，它是描寫水中妖女迷人的傳事的：「月光嫵媚地照着上，妖女們坐在池畔笑語着，當不宰的戀人向她們追求而墜入池中時，水波盪漾着，花在微笑，月竟愈發冰冷了」。朱小姐的眼中晶瑩着淚珠，她一連問了好幾次：「眞的嗎」？「是嗎」？她的手指增加了力量——愛的力量，美的感覺，琴聲像水波一般地在我耳旁輕輕地流動。那一對不幸的戀人，朱小姐今春到美國深造去了，陳君也到常州音樂院去度敎授生涯，他們的故事像烟一般地消失在生活的海裏。</p>
<p>「天下沒有不散的筵席」，每當曲終人散之際，總要使人與起無常的哀思。音樂是時間的藝術，轉瞬即逝；可是它却牢牢地印在我們的腦海裏；它活在我們的心裏，正如我們懷念我們已醉世的良友，想起往日的交誼，潛然涕下。當這春光明媚，靑年競向郊外尋覓春意的時節，我不禁記起三年前在周家花園野餐的游伴魏小姐，她是我妹妹的同學，一個傑出的鋼琴學生，當她正預備音樂院畢業考試的節目時，她病倒了，是用功過度而獲得的肺病。好勝的她，在病榻上忍受漫長的歲月。經過半年的療養，彷彿略見健康，正好有人要我去演奏一個室樂，我選了Handel的Sonata　No.4，同時也請她和我合彈這個古典作品。她是很高興的她曾爲我彈過Beethoven'sRoniance　in　G，我們合作得很愉快。雖然是隨隨便便的演奏，她願意多加一些練習，因爲她說荒廢了半年，手指有些別扭。樂曲是很容易，我們即使在練習時，也不會半途停止，她的琴聲，我聽得很淸楚，古典的對位法，二個旋律此起彼伏，一種調和的美，使人陶醉在一個愉快的游戲中，可是這不足以記述成一件故事。</p>
<p>當我們練習停止時，她的母親給我們做了很好的點心，她父親和客人都稱讚我們的演奏。這使她更爲興奮，她的畢業考最大的節目是Iscaikowsky's　PianoConcerto　in　Bb，她半年來雖然不會在琴上練習，却在心中時時加以溫習。忽然，她放下茶杯，跑到鋼琴前坐下，琴鍵在她敏捷的指觸下，喝出一段悲愴大師的哀歌，她的兩腮發着紅光，呼吸漸漸短促，手指似乎在抖顫，樂聲停在一個變和絃上，她緊張的嘴角，浮起一個輕輕的微笑臉，她說：「我還能彈」！</p>
<p>我會在蘭心聽過鋼琴家們和樂隊合奏這首名曲，吳樂懿彈得很好，她使我聽得非常放心，董光光的名字和這曲起首的三個和弦的效果很相像，請恕我，我也許沒有從戲院帶回別的記憶。Rubinstein是舉世公認的這首樂曲奏手的權威，我們不能懷疑這些名家們演奏的價値，可是使我的心弦劇烈地震動的是魏小姐這片段的演奏。</p>
<p>幾天後，我們的小音樂會演奏過了，她還是顯得很高興，我請她到周家花園去野餐，她說：「吃不下什麽，走走也好」。那天，我為她拍下最後的幾幀歸咎。回家不久，刀子就重睡到病榻上了。後來一直不曾看見過她，她的墓木也許在抽着新芽了，可是我不知她葬在何處，每當我聽見這降B大調的鋼琴協奏曲時，彷彿看見她垂着雙辮的背影，腓紅雙頰的側影，和怕羞的聲音，唱着哀怨的曲調；透過了她，更看見這位北國大師的愁容，爲着全人類絕望的命運，滴下他熟情的眼淚。</p>
<p>朋友，這是我會聽見過的一些音樂，你覺得太過於感傷嗎？可不是嗎？（三十六年淸明後一日）</p>
<h3>春夜</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>渡過寒冷的冬天</p>
<p>冬眠的流浪漢</p>
<p>又像驚　後蟲豸</p>
<p>在城市裏出現了。</p>
<p>該是城市人不安的夢罷</p>
<p>這霓虹燈的花圈</p>
<p>充滿了不安和惶恐</p>
<p>城市是製造着罪惡</p>
<p>文明的堾墓呀——</p>
<p>有多少響樓拾翠的少女</p>
<p>會想到無　足的浪費</p>
<p>是用人們底骨骼　築成高樓的麽</p>
<p>而他們底酒杯中</p>
<p>紅的是血，白的是眼淚喲……</p>
<p>我將無法忍耐</p>
<p>這人世間料峭的春寒</p>
<p>（一九四七·四。春日寂寞中）</p>
<h3>十四行詩</h3>
<p>— 司空無忌</p>
<p>心靈的海鷗，飛越過虛幻的峰端。</p>
<p>芷撞擎着歌管，使之抑揚！</p>
<p>按着音樂的步子，擁智　的凡列斯於灰色的懷中。信仰諦聽了細微圓渾的呼吸。</p>
<p>願你無邪的足跡，邁入深刻的階梯感謝聖潔的眼睛從死獄中赦免了受離者的罪行；</p>
<p>容許我沿着淺綠色衣裳廠邊，</p>
<p>探求　裘連天的自由的草原。</p>
<p>菲律賓流浪人底歌聲啊！</p>
<p>是那麽悽愴！</p>
<p>我渺茫而又溫馨的夢呢？</p>
<p>却在舞池燈影裏投下了許多個凍漪。</p>
<p>惱恨太短促的時間，掩希望入夜之深宅；</p>
<p>我祈求明天的大太陽，使你笑得更爽朗！</p>
<p>（四月十一日無闌，百盛交幷：寫此。）</p>
<h3>吻</h3>
<p>— 還休</p>
<p>爲什麽不使</p>
<p>草尖的露珠</p>
<p>與大地融合，</p>
<p>給暫忽的生命以潤滋</p>
<p>永生在風雨的刺激裏？</p>
<p>爲什麽不把高舉的生命之獎，</p>
<p>深深落下，</p>
<p>重重划去，</p>
<p>在無邊浩瀚的洋海</p>
<p>濩駛到永恒的彼岸？</p>
<p>旣然，「眞」就是捨與，</p>
<p>「美」不是取拾；</p>
<p>就讓歡樂與苦痛，</p>
<p>幸福與血淚，</p>
<p>永永相吻。</p>
<h3>春之思念</h3>
<p>— 李果</p>
<p>——寄給林拉</p>
<p>我站在村邊靜靜地聽</p>
<p>西北風吹着駝鈴</p>
<p>傑有人在呼喚</p>
<p>那可是你的思念</p>
<p>我散步在綠色的林間</p>
<p>有蜜蜂播送花香</p>
<p>像有人在低低地　息</p>
<p>那可是你的悵惘</p>
<p>溪水裏倒映着晨光</p>
<p>兩尾小鯽魚在戲弄太陽</p>
<p>水面上浮起幾朶漩渦</p>
<p>那可是你的笑靨</p>
<p>我從夢中醒來</p>
<p>雲雀在樓外飛鳴</p>
<p>暖風吹開我的紗窗</p>
<p>那可是你的歌聲</p>
<p>（三六·四·紅紙廊）</p>
<h3>思想家的莎士比亞</h3>
<p>（英國新聞處特稿）</p>
<p>莎士比亞所以這樣偉大，他的奧妙究竟在那裏？這問題的答案不祗一個。有人說是他詩歌的奇妙和樂調，許多人却以爲是他創造人物的驚人能力，因爲他能使這些人物在言語和行動中顯得如同活人一樣。以演員的立塲說來，戲劇家莎士比亞爲他們創造的人物，是最迎合演員們的理想的，而他的劇本在戲院中的趣味也是最高。可是在觀劇的興奮和蠱惑的情緒中，我們往往忽略了這位偉大詩人「思考」的能力。</p>
<p>莎士比亞的思相不但在他息己的時代是眞切的，現在還很眞切，而且永遠是眞切的。他能用一句簡單的話提出人的美德和罪惡，性格的問題，和整個人生的間題，而使人永不忘記。</p>
<p>世人都希望成名，不論成爲聞名的詩人，政治家，士兵也好，或是藝術家，作家也好；可是世人也親眼目覩名人聲敗名裂潦倒一生的先例。現在且讓我們設想到了倫敦的韋斯敏斯特皇宮，在一個四壁蕭條的小屋子裏站着一個偉大的牧師，疑視着一扇剛才關上的門；也自言自語的說：</p>
<p>「以住作我的後盾的一片好心現在所餘下的是多有限！我已紅從此喪失了我顯要的職位！人的命運是多飄忽無常啊！由於早日成名的希望纋有成年時代的事功，一旦成名，却又從旁來了意外的打擊，從此斷送了我的事業。在我以往的政治生涯上，我曾經不顧一切危險挺身前進，現在我覺悟到自己太苛求勢力，我一向聽憑傲慢的心引領，到現在這顆傲慢的心再也不能够扶助我。我旣襄老而又疲憊，四周還受忌和憒恨所國困，內心喪失自尊，俗世的名譽和勢尤變得多空虛而可憎！」</p>
<p>上面這一段無疑的是一個偉大的思想家所發表的關於人類很重視的一件事的眞理。這位思想家並不是說這些話的伍爾士萊主敎，而是莎士比亞借他的口所發表的思想。他所說的是三百多年前的眞理。這些觀念不但本身給人深刻的印象，莎士比亞更用詩，辯才和樂調加深了他們的印象</p>
<p>無論用那一個題目考騐莎士比亞的思想，即使用現代的語言來表達，都能發覺他的思想包容着很大的力量和恒久的眞理。在現代生活中我們還彷彿常常聽到莎士比亞眞理的呼聲。要解決現代生活中的問題，我們處應當翻開莎士比亞的作品，參考他三世紀以前對當時英國的見解呢。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　407</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見立即把原來小型封套，仔細兩面檢視了一下，見沒有偸折痕跡，這才放心，把原封套小心打開，只見套裏又有一套。這更小型的封套上，只有四個小字：「萍兒手展！」</p>
<p>看了這探的字句，鶴見又現出了幾分躊躇的樣子。五個人都集中眼光，在這小封套上，神情也都相當緊張。鶴見猶預了一下，便從衣袋內搯出一柄小刀，細心把封口挑開，他本人自己，也不明白爲何這等婆婆媽媽起來。也許正是同想到靑木長老，那種古怪神秘，心下有些怔忡的原故</p>
<p>封套挑開，鶴見抽出裏面的信箋，一眼瞥見薄薄一張白紙，似乎不見字跡，立刻變了顏色。比及展開那張信箋，大家都詫異得怔住了；原來箋上果眞並無字句，只在箋的正中，有黑墨到的一個圖圈，大的一枚一圓銀幣大小；看得出是信手到下的，却是十分團正。</p>
<p>「這是什麽玩意？……這古怪的老頭兒！」鶴見詫異得忘了形，說起日本話來，對自咕噥着。</p>
<p>特二號李明，韓方代衣，正岩，三個人看見了這個神秘的信件，本來已經有些莫明其妙，這時聽見鶴見自言自認說着「老頭兒」，因不知是誰，當然更加弄不明白了。祗有守一，在百忍莊襄，聽過覺厂老人，用科學方式，解說我國所所謂自占不傳之秘「大羅靈書」中「投牒幻影」一條，猜到這封神秘信箋，大約總是心電你達一類的玩意，沒有什麽大了不起，也並不値得大驚小怪：</p>
<p>「想必還發信的人，「老頭兒」，是「東敎」一派的信徒？」守一淡淡地問着、鶴見。</p>
<p>「你說得正對。」鶴見恍然如夢裏驚醒一般，表現十二分欽佩的神情，瞧着守一，「聽說這位靑木長老，中村小姐的飾傅，受過密宗正傳，正是日本稱爲『東敎』的；老兄大槪也懂得？………」</p>
<p>「懂是不懂的」，守一搖着頭，「做莊可有人懂得，記得寒族姻伯，覺厂老人，他老人家講演過，……這套玩意，被動方面，就是小說上常提的『心血來潮』，尋常人『心驚肉跳……坐臥不寗』等等。卞動的，有『會母嚙指』，鄉村婦女的『發誓賭兄』，甚至『王婆駡雞』一類動作，都可算在裏面……西洋新近所硏究的『心電傳　『，也是這一套。大概不外乎『應用心理學』的什麽『天眼通』『隔地催眠』之頭………」</p>
<p>「這可好了！」鶴見精神又振作起采，「貴莊……覺厂老先生旣經硏究過，必能解釋這個秘密，就請……」</p>
<p>「也好，」守一知道鶴見要請他爲這事問莊一次，自己也有這個意思；「回頭我把這東西拿去，請老人家看看。」</p>
<p>「磕頭，磕頭，」鶴見有些語無倫次了，「拜託，拜託……那們說，九九歸一，又要回到中村小姐的問題上了。我們亂七八糟，始終沒有請這位老兄把找到的消息宣佈出來……」鶴見瞧着韓方代表點點頭。表示抱歉。</p>
<h3>風塵三俠</h3>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>小孩一生下地，就呱呱地用他整個的生命哭着；似乎在向這價多難的療世提出抌議。</p>
<p>老頭子當完成了他一生的理想，而在向那美麗的歷史回頭吿別的時候，往往發出由衷的微笑。那笑容，是那麽天眞，又是那麽恬靜而耐人尋思。</p>
<p>這種哭與笑，都令我神往。然而，我更愛後者的笑有勝於前者的笑。我說：</p>
<p>「人類第一聲哭，不如最未一次笑更接近美與詩。」</p>
<p>在某種涵義中，三個人生活在一起，會比兩個人生活在一起更爲寂寞。</p>
<p>我怕寂寞，然而我更怕將自己投入市僧性的宴會裏，我對於噪聲的縣懸，一如古代犯人看見了　　。</p>
<p>不可解釋的，是自已也有飲　止渴的領向。在「我有嘉賓，鼓瑟吹笙」的時候，我雖無孟簽的壯氣以「慷慨悲歌」。更是，更巨大的寞寂滲和了抑鬱，終究使我不　終席。</p>
<p>「冠蓋滿京華，斯人獨憔悴」。這是小時候，就被我深愛的詩句。我想正因爲京羣有着數不淸的冠蓋，才特別感到斯人憔悴的可貴。</p>
<p>我時常暗暗地爲許多朋友的健康祝福。可是，當我發現一個朋友消瘦了，我會對他特別感到親切。</p>
<h3>出軌的話</h3>
<p>— 懷寶</p>
<p>前幾天火車接連出軌，弄得旅客人心惶惶，幾乎不敢出門。出軌並不是空前絕無的事，袛是跟着前一時飛機失事而來，火車竟接二速三的出軌，可就令人精神不安了。</p>
<p>出軌的原因正如火災一探，可以說出一大串；然而最明顯的原因，總是鐵軌的年久失修，下面枕木朽腐不堪，難以負荷車壓，隨時都有崩陷的可能。抗戰以來，這些鐵路一直沒有好好養護過，到了現在，枕木自然要朽爛了，螺旋自然要銹損了。任何道路，總須經常不斷地修築，才能保持完好的狀態，現在一停就停上十年之久，那有不出毛病的道理？</p>
<p>這個責任當然不在鐵路當局，，因爲淪陷時期鞭長莫及，是無可奈何的事。可是勝利以後的復興，當局者却須積極負起責任來。調整車輛，增加班次，以及减少旅客的擁擠等等，固然極其重要，然而旅程的穩妥可靠，似乎尤其來得重要。過去一個時期，不少人因爲飛行危險，都改道而乘火車；如令火車再像飛機那樣常常出事，那就呌人有行不得也」之感。倘然非走不可，恐怕袛有從火車再退一步，乘坐內河小火輪（誰知道到那時候又是一偭什麽樣子？）或者索性坐獨輸小車以至於徒步跋涉了。</p>
<p>人家正在試把原子能運用到民用工業上面，而我們却在腐朽的枕木上冒險駛車。呌人想用原始的交通工具，這不是一時的落後與前進的問題，而是願不願意不斷求進步的問題。鐵路原是一件新東西，然而在這新益求新的時代，它已經不是站在最前鋒了。話雖然如此，它本身還在不停地革新着。拿這情形與我們横臥在鐵軌下面百萬的朽木一比，實在令人憂慮。這些破破爛鐵豈可當作古董以至於國粹看呢？</p>

<h3>「裙帶風」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>在這貪汚滿天下的今日，我們這個社會裏，正有着多少人靠了女人的關係，結交權貴，攏絡感情，通過了裙帶關係，說人情，走內綫，以達到其升官發財目的。「裙帶風」裏那個亦官亦商的鄧總經理，他是八面威風，不可一世的人物，多少人向他諂媚低頭，可是他又得向上司的太太報效，他派了馬秘書去陪她們打牌，先已經指定只許輸，不許贏，甚至輸得越多越好，這是劇作者對現實多麽辛辣的諷刺呀！此外，只憑了太太的一句話，必須專家才能勝任的要職，委派了自己的小舅子，後來太太爲了保守她不可吿人的秘密，改換了主意，鄧總經理便又不得不改派了那位水產專家重去南屛島，這正是那些自認爲上流社會人物的寫照。在這裙帶滿天飛的社會裏，一切都正像這故事中那末不合理，現在作者將他們無情地暴露在觀衆面前，用諷刺來鞭策這一羣腐化的人物。</p>
<p>這樣一個內容豐富現實的戲，但是在演出上却使我們感到有些失望。如果不健忘的話，「裙帶風」曾經由上海劇藝社在舞台上演出過，拿現在攝成影片的「裙帶風」跟舞台上有着輝煌成續的「裙帶風」相比，那是太遜色了。尤其影片上的結尾，陳建南接受鄧總經理的委派赴南屛島，是極爲不妥的改編。</p>
<p>爲什麼看過舞合劇的觀衆，不滿意電影上的演出，那是導演李萍情對於喜劇「裙帶風」的處理問題，從戲的格體，調子，節奏，都沒有適當的把握住，他只是輕描淡寫的交待了劇情的進展，沒有深度的刻劃這些人物與事件。在故事進展到快近結束的時候，應該是風捲殘葉般快速度，急轉直下，然而他是那末慢條斯的在擺佈，把一些不必要的小處塡塞了戲的進展，結果是顯得鬆散而無力。這是値得惋惜的。</p>
<p>在大後方舞台上有着輝煌成就的舒繼雯，這裏沒有帶來特殊的成績，她的總經理太太還不够應有的風度與氣派。周伯勳的鄧總經理，演得極佳，對人物性格的創造與外型的雕塑，都相當的成功。馮喆的陳建南演來恰到好處。丁然的馬秘書，舞台氣味略嫌太重，楊微的陳白琪，在女角中是是好的一人，生動細膩而自然。</p>
<h3>聊齊氣味</h3>
<p>— 舟</p>
<p>看到上海報上的電影廣吿和批評，以威爾斯等四大作家的頭銜號召觀衆的「新聊齋誌異」，像煞賣座並不佳，在歐美物質文明的帮助下，這樣的片子，我想，倒可以算是製造神經病患者的利器。據說英美若十科學家迄今還在硏究靈魂的存在與否；它們的文壇上亦暢銷着神怪故事和偵探小說，神經衰弱的人是不適宜於受這樣的「敎育」的。</p>
<p>在中國，已不必「新聊齋誌異」來帮忙，社會上離奇古怪的情形，大足以使小民們患神經病了。日前上海報上載一消息，題目便是「物價瘋狂歟？小民瘋狂歟？」文內說石家莊有一市民，上街購物，因對方要價過高，刺激神經，當時暈倒路上。這故事大約不會是脫離現實的作家們的產品，同樣的故事也多得很，不久前報上就傳說有一個久未上街購物的老太婆，去買一斤猪肉，身邊却只帶了十元鈔數張。</p>
<p>一切的藝術作品都是反映現實的產物。「新聊齋誌異」的不吃香，原因或許就爲了中國現實社會的「聊齋氣味」已逮勝於電影故事多多了吧？</p>
<h3>聽空中音樂　對中華口琴會的期望</h3>
<p>— 楊平章</p>
<p>二十日晚，中華口琴會假上海廣播電台，舉行了一次盛大的空中口琴音樂會「所演奏的都是世界名曲，像「小夜曲」，「西班牙圓舞曲」，及「雙鷹進行曲」等。還有該會總會長王慶動先生作的「國光三部曲」也在演奏之列。這一切的演奏，可以說是口琴界空前的盛舉。</p>
<p>節目有王慶隆及王慶瑞的獨奏，二重奏，及該會交響樂隊同手風琴隊的大合奏。著名的手風琴家卡德鮑特爾氏也演奏了幾支名曲。當那種充滿了活力而且令人眷戀的樂章，在肅靜的空氣中，掀起了動聽的旋律時，使人感到無限的激動；內心隨着曲調的變遷面呈示興奮與歡呼。尤其是王慶隆君的獨奏，眞是好聽極了。</p>
<p>關於音樂上的技術性，筆者是門外漢，所以不敢胡亂地批評。不過，在現今的樂壇上，能有這樣的成續表現出來，無論如何是令人高興的。</p>
<p>在今日的上海，充滿了靡麽之音；因此，人們的嘴裏也儘是繚繞着那些使人沉醉的流行歌曲。當我們扭開無綫電收音機的時候，其中的音樂節目，幾乎全被流行歌曲包辦了，難得聽到世界名曲及交響樂的。希望中華口琴會以後能够常常舉行空中音樂會，使無數的人者能在工作之餘，暫時拋開了碌碌囂攘的世界，靜靜地分　一點精神的食糧。</p>
<p>並希望中華口琴會繼續努力，為中國的音樂界發出燦爛的光輝。</p>
<h3>攀爐峯　探禹穴　浙紹紀遊</h3>
<p>— 梅生</p>
<p>偶然的一個機會，和二三親友，對了紹興，翌晨即　一小舟，搖至距城約七八里之禹王殿，老遠就望見巍峨廟院　於山際，絕似西湖凈慈寺之雄峙南屏山麓。裏面畫棟雕樑，宏構猶存，惟各般供奉，除正中孤立大禹王之塑像外，已空無所有。幾經兵　，無怪其然。</p>
<p>殿左側有「空石亭」中立一丈係石塊，頂有一孔，據碑記云：上古君王痤櫬，多壓一巨石於棺上，大槪因此發現，始考測爲禹陵所在，栖皇一世，廟祝千秋，豐功偉業自不朽也。</p>
<p>離禹陵往香爐峯，初入山，路均巨石平舖，環繞而上，遂漸趨高，尙不吃力，迨過頭天竺，由殿後拾級直上，峯峻路狹，已感累人，後更意上愈陡，面仰視猶高不可攀，行行重行行，息息復息息，爬到中天竺早喘息不堪。山童携竹杖兜售，正切需要，價僅百元，彌覺可喜，可見山居誠樸，絕無投機敲索之情事。</p>
<p>得了一根竹杖，無異多了一條腿，扶策再上，因山高壁削，路旁均圍以鐵欄，以防不測，又高攀三四百級，方達香爐峯巔。</p>
<p>大士像前，香火旺盛，，飲食稍憩，於峯頭閒眺，羣山咸伏眼底，白雲吐於脚下，四圍松風，萬壑聲，吼吼簌簌，直欲凌處而去，遠視城郭河流，已若虫沙芥十，空曠幽深，同非久困塵世者所能夢想，即吾等時處明媚之西十湖邊，常登南北高峯，至此亦有「除却巫山不是雲」之感。雄奇壯秀，誠不愧天竺第二峯矣。</p>
<p>下山雖較上山有力，而階石險滑，一不經心，亦有傾跌之處。摔下即萬丈嚴整，立成　粉，世崎嶇，上下山可爲一絕妙參證。</p>
<h3>無題</h3>

<h3>首都的「盲腸」</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>凡是未到過首都的人，對於夫子廟都不免有幾分響往的心情。因爲那兒是「六朝金粉」底令心醉的「勝地」啊。</p>
<p>可是，當你實地到了夫子廟之後，假如你藤　多金的話，那麼你的觀光將會一無所得，在燈紅酒綠，塵俗囂擾的現狀里，你如沉下心來一回，發古情之幽思」，亦是不可能的。前人筆下的秦淮河，桃葉渡，都去得遙遠了，一灣里且發具的死水，吿訴你這時候這地方皆已經霉腐得發臭啦。</p>
<p>光說廟裏吧：白天裏倒是顯得相當熱鬧，黑擠擠的人頭進進出出，自然均是來探勝和觀光的。廟裏面，攤頭不少，有吃食攤，百貨攤，各色各樣都有，一個初住到首都的人，摸不到買傢具門徑的話，這是倒是可以解決了這個難題。此外，一片空塲子便成了江湖賣藝人的天地了，但都儉俗得很，夜裏，廟裏活動靜止了，廟外又成了一般探險家冐險的樂園。妓女，歌女，鄉導，肉市塲一片，可說應有盡有六華春，金谷……那些酒茶館的門前，自黄昏時候起就車水馬龍，流綫，吉普，擺成一字長蛇陳，暗示它們的主人們正在酒興方酣呢。龜兒，老鴇，站滿在街沿上，嗡嗡地像窠蜂似的，一個單身的行人，尤其是初次逛廟的，不當心會給突然在耳上響着的聲音嚇得一大跳。茶社裏有大鼓，也有彩排，大爺們酒醉飯飽之餘，那兒便成了他們唯一的消夜之塲。五千餘元一杯的茶資，塲塲客滿，我不敢說他們是不是爲眞正的娛樂而去，但醉翁之意不在酒的正大有人在。八爺們絕對禁止入茶社，未免是樁太殺風景的事，面長官大人們換上一套藏靑制服，又可無拘無束的快樂自在了。這，有人說夫子廟是首都的盲腸，也似乎是不無道理的吧。</p>

<p>但跟五歲的孩子講理，終於還嫌早一些。</p>
<p>「不！不！兎子爸爸是外婆買給小榮的！」他堅持着不肯，並且也有他的理由</p>
<p>「你交給姐姐不一樣嗎？她不會給你丢掉的！」蘭仍想說服他，口氣變得硬了一些。</p>
<p>小榮撅起着小嘴，雙手緊抱住他的愛物，瞪着眼，仍沒有讓步的意思。</p>
<p>「我不！我要帶着走！」</p>
<p>「走！走！走！」蘭一賭氣就不再往下說，自己提了一個小手巾包，當先走出屋去。</p>
<p>榮兒來不及的追上去，害怕他媽一走，姐姐會搶他；可是緋緋却一動也沒有動，塔然地站在門口邊，心裏像有說不出的懊喪。</p>

<h3>The War Situation in Shandong Province is Increasingly Optimistic; Communist Offensive Completely Crushed; Morale Doubles After Chief of General Staff Chen Arrives in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 27th] Since Chief of General Staff Chen arrived in Xuzhou and took command, the morale at the front has been greatly boosted. The situation in the central section of the Jinpu Railway has already improved. The National Army achieved victories north of Dawenkou. The Communist army had gathered seven columns this time. From the 23rd, two columns fiercely attacked Tai'an, three columns maneuvered towards the southwest of Tai'an and the area north of Dawenkou, one column attacked Dawenkou, and another column suddenly moved south and eastward. For five days, the National Army followed the planned strategy to intercept and engage the invading Communist forces in bloody battles. Reinforcements arrived continuously, further boosting morale. As of today, not only has the Communist offensive been crushed, but a new situation has been achieved where the Communist forces have been isolated and surrounded separately. Furthermore, the Fourth Column of the Communist army, which attacked the area north of Dawenkou, was defeated by the National Army on the night of the 26th and retreated southeast towards Tai'an. The National Army is currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 26th] Over the past week, the war situation in Shandong Province has become increasingly optimistic, and the focus of the war has shifted from southern Shandong to central Shandong.

The fierce fighting lasted four days and nights. By the evening of the 25th, the battle had become increasingly brutal. Communist casualties are estimated to be at least over ten thousand. The National Army in southern Shandong, taking advantage of the Communist main force's northward movement, completed a large encirclement of the Fourth and Sixth Columns entrenched in the mountainous area south of Loude, northeast of Sishui, with one part of their forces. Another part of their forces routed the Ninth Column entrenched in Baimaguan and Jiunvguan, southwest of Mengyin, and the main force of the Eighth Column in Mengyin. The vanguard has already entered Mengyin and is currently pacifying the local area and comforting the refugees. As for the National Army in the Linyi area, they have pushed the Communist Seventh Column to the vicinity of Ju County. The Second Column, unable to withstand the attacks, fled to Xintai. The National Army along the Jiaoji Railway has also eliminated Communist resistance and advanced to the area between Longshan and Mingshui.</p>

Another mechanized unit has pressed on to Zhaixidian and is currently maneuvering to search for the main force of the Communist army in the area. The garrison in Shijiazhuang also launched an attack yesterday in coordination. The meeting of the forces from the north and south is expected soon.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Baoding, This Newspaper, 27th] To support the advance of the National Army southward, elite troops of the National Army on the east side of the Baoshi Road are encircling and attacking the remnants of the Communist forces in Xu County, Boye, and Gaoyang.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Taiyuan, This Newspaper, 27th] The flames of war are spreading, and the situation in Shanxi is becoming increasingly tense.

<h3>Communist Party Attempts to Hold on to Dalian; Transfers Troops to Covet Pulandian; Conspires to Obstruct the Takeover of Lüda</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] It is learned that the Communist army recently transferred over four thousand infantry soldiers from Yantai, Shandong Province. They were well-equipped and transported to Dalian on five sailing ships. They subsequently moved north to Jinzhou and took up defensive positions in Tangfangtun and Chongmiaozi, 14 kilometers south of Pulandian. They also increased the number of stretcher teams, claiming that they would counterattack Pulandian within a month, hold Dalian firmly, and never retreat.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] Zhao Lun-san, the "Vice President of the General Chamber of Commerce" under the control of the Communist army in Dalian, fled to Wafangdian in southern Liaoning with his family on the 22nd and surrendered to the National Army. When Zhao left Dalian, the Communist army was organizing the Guandong State Public Office and had intended to appoint him as the Director of the Commerce Department. Zhao told reporters that the puppet municipal government of Dalian recently issued 300 million yuan in public bonds, and the people are living under tyrannical oppression. Many have been bankrupted by buying the public bonds. In addition, patriotic youths are arrested and secretly assassinated, with several cases occurring every day. Recently, as news of the National Army's entry into Lüda has spread several times a day, the Communist army has colluded with certain parties to violate public opinion, organize the Guandong State Public Office, which is nominally democratic but in reality a pretext and conspiracy by certain parties to obstruct the National Army's takeover.</p>
<h3>Handover Ceremony of the New First Army Solemnly Held in Changchun</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 26th] The handover ceremony between the old and new army commanders was held at 9:00 AM. Over eight thousand officers and soldiers from the army attended. The ceremony was solemn and grand. First, a military parade was held.

The divisions under the army presented General Sun with silver shield stands to commemorate his achievements. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Changchun, 27th] Officers of the New First Army held their first group wedding here on the 27th, with a total of nineteen couples participating.

<h3>Li Huang Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing; Will Go to Nanjing to Decline the Position of Minister of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Li Huang transited through Chengdu and arrived in Chongqing today. He is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 29th to attend the Standing Committee meeting of the China Youth Party, and then go to Nanjing to meet with President Zhang to firmly decline the position of Minister of Economic Affairs. He told reporters: "When I heard in Chengdu that the Central Government was going to assign me to the position of Minister of Economic Affairs, I immediately telegraphed Mr. Yuejun to decline. However, the day before yesterday, I received a reply telegram from President Zhang saying that the appointment had already been announced when he received my telegram, and that I should come as soon as possible to take on the difficult task together. I am a mere scholar and have not studied practical political affairs. The economic undertaking has countless threads, and I fear that I will cause mistakes in the future. It is better to decline in advance. Therefore, I have decided to go to Shanghai the day after tomorrow to explain my intentions at the Standing Committee meeting of the party, and then go to Nanjing to firmly decline to President Zhang. As for the rumors that the Youth Party is advocating participation in local politics, the policy program clearly stipulates that all parties should jointly promote the implementation of constitutionalism. Now that the Youth Party has already participated in the central government, it should also bear its responsibility for local politics."</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The standing committee members of the Youth Party in Shanghai and responsible personnel of party affairs from various regions held a meeting at the headquarters on Haig Road all day yesterday, which was very tense. It is reported that the main purpose was for the standing committee members to listen to the opinions of the responsible persons from various regions and to understand the situation of the personnel in each branch, in preparation for the distribution of positions in the future.</p>

He visited Wu Xianzizi yesterday morning and also visited Xu Chuanlin, but Wu was out. According to Lei, he believes that the internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party can be resolved after Wu Xianzizies mediation.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>

<h3>The Taichung County Council Sends a Telegram to the Chairman to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] In response to the recent incident in Taiwan, the central government handled the situation with leniency, and a satisfactory resolution was achieved.

As for the 135 million yuan of recovery subsidies allocated by the central government to the counties in eastern Gansu, and the 150 million yuan of emergency relief funds for Qing, Huan, and He counties, the provincial government has transferred them to the counties for use.</p>
<h3>Counties in the Recovered Areas of Northern Shaanxi Will Implement Immigration and Village Mergers</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] Regarding the clearing of household registration and reorganization of the Baojia system in the recovered areas of northern Shaanxi, Chairman Zhu Shaozhou recently made a "immigration and village mergers" proposal to increase administrative efficiency and improve the living standards of the people. It is also learned that Zhu will explain this in detail in the coming days. In addition, the Shaanxi Provincial Government believes that the twelve counties along the Diaoyu, such as Chunhua, and the counties under the jurisdiction of the Fourth and Sixth Military Regions in southern Shaanxi, are inherently barren and have been disrupted by the Communist army. It is proposed to classify them as pacification zones to show concern and compassion. A detailed plan has been drafted and submitted to the central government for approval.</p>
<h3>Relief Funds Universally Distributed in Yan'an; The Market is Increasingly Prosperous</h3>
<p>People Present a Banner to the Chairman</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xi'an, 26th] Since the distribution of relief funds began in Yan'an, more and more people have returned. So far, a total of over 150 million yuan of relief funds have been distributed, along with over 5,000 bolts of cloth (each bolt being 12 feet long). Everyone now has a new set of clothes, and they are using the relief funds to engage in small-scale trade, making the market increasingly prosperous. Cai Fengzhang, a member of the former Communist "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" Senate, and others said that the universal distribution of relief funds this time is unprecedented in Yan'an's history. They also represented the people of Yan'an in presenting Chairman Chiang with a "Ten Thousand People Support" banner, which has been handed over to Peng Liren and Xie Zhigang, supervisors of the Emergency Relief Headquarters, to take to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] All sectors of Xi'an have raised a total of 1.15 billion yuan in comfort funds to慰劳 the generals and soldiers who suppress the rebellion in northern Shaanxi. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Liu Chucai led all the members of the comfort team to visit Director Hu Zongnan and presented the funds, expressing condolences on behalf of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Loan to Build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway; Sino-French Negotiations to be Completed</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 27th] He Beiheng, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, told reporters today that the Sino-French negotiations on the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway have entered the final stage and will be completed as soon as Premier Zhang Qun approves it. The total amount of the French loan is set at 20 million US dollars, but part of it will be paid in French francs. This is a compromise that partly meets the Chinese government's hope, which is to pay in French francs. However, the correct ratio of French francs to US dollars in the loan has yet to be resolved.</p>
<h3>Internal Rift in the Chinese Communist Party Deepens; Launch Anti-Mao Zedong Struggle</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] Over three hundred Communist soldiers, captured by the National Army when recovering Shiyu, have been escorted to Datong. According to the captured Communist soldiers, Chen Shaoyu (Wang Ming), Lu Dingyi, and others have an organization called the "Chinese Communist Party Members Democratic Association" to oppose the leadership of Mao Zedong. Chen and others advocated that the CCP's sabotage of the Political Consultative Conference was caused by instructions from certain parties. The Mao faction attempted to use force to overthrow the government and split the country. Now, the terror of "rectification" has spread to all departments, especially intellectuals who feel most uneasy. The internal rift is deepening. This proves that the CCP's blind action of being hostile to peaceful nation-building has been abandoned by enlightened people within the party.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The anti-Mao movement within the Chinese Communist Party has intensified since the National Army recovered Yan'an. This can be proved by the anti-Mao propaganda materials recently seized by the National Army at the front. These propaganda materials are signed "The Emergency Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet-Luzhou-Anhui Border Region Party Affairs Committee." The original text of the propaganda materials is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Oppose Mao Zedong's Use of Armed Force to Seize Power</p>
<p>After the victory of the great Anti-Japanese War, our commanders, fighters, and the people of the whole country still cannot get rest and continue to live a life of war, born in fire and dying in battle. This is such a painful thing. Everyone should know that this is entirely the evil consequence of Mao Zedong's leftist mistakes in using armed force to seize power.</p>
<p>However, the policy of armed struggle for the past twenty years has not increased the CCP's political status, but has led the party into a dead end. The ten years of land revolution sacrificed the main force of the Red Army, who broke through and went north, and ended the consolidated Jiangxi Soviet regime in armed struggle.</p>
<p>Since the eight years of sacred resistance against Japan in the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, the armed forces under the leadership of our party have grown stronger in the national liberation struggle. We created many great and moving achievements in the self-defense war against Japanese imperialism. At that time, we absolutely agreed and strongly advocated it.</p>
<p>Now, the people of the whole country need rest and need to live and work in peace. In the tide of peaceful and democratic politics, we advocate peaceful construction and rationally resolving the Kuomintang-Communist issue. We oppose Mao Zedong's subjective rule of the entire party, using armed struggle to seize power, and abandoning the struggle for the epoch-making Political Consultative Conference. This is entirely a blind action of left-wing opportunism. All comrades of our Emergency Committee cannot sit idly by and watch Mao Zedong lead our party on the road to danger. As early as in the resolution of December 1, 1944, we lodged a serious protest to Mao Zedong, pointing out the left-leaning errors of the Mao faction.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Mao Zedong's left-leaning errors have not only not been corrected, but have become even more willful, expanding the army, and purely taking the heroic concept of using armed force to open the world, causing bloody flames to burn again all over our country. The people of the whole country, who came out of the arduous and dangerous national war, have been dragged into this innocent domestic civil war. This is not only a loss to the people, but also a loss to our party itself.</p>
<p>Before and after the political consultation meeting of various parties, how much did the people of the whole country, various small parties, and social leaders sympathize with our party and support our country to resolve national affairs politically? However, since the Mao faction promoted the Datong and Zhangjiakou battles, and transferred Zhou Enlai back to instigate military blind offensive operations in various places, how many comrades has our party lost? The reaction of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, social leaders, and the people of the whole country to our party is so bad that they have turned to the Kuomintang, causing a great political blow and loss to our party. Obviously, this is the result of Mao Zedong's heroic thinking of using armed force to open the world.</p>
<p>The final moment is approaching. The fact is that the Mao faction's left-leaning error of using armed force to open the world is no longer allowed to continue. We call on all loyal comrades of the party and the people of the whole country to unite and launch a struggle against Mao Zedong's left-wing opportunism and the civil war that disregards the interests of the people!</p>
<p>We want peace, we want to live and work in peace!</p>
<p>We want Mao Zedong to admit his mistakes and stop the civil war</p>
<p>We support the Emergency Committee in forcing Mao Zedong to step down</p>
<p>(2) Oppose Treating the People as Cannon Fodder</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, the military setbacks in the Lunan area, from the breakout from Linyi to today, have gone through many fierce battles, sacrificing countless excellent commanders and fighters and heroic militia members within the party, especially the number of militia members who sacrificed is enough to make us surprised. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, people will still see this bloody reality. This is entirely the evil result of Mao Zedong's left-leaning ideology.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong said, "China has 400 million people, and we will sacrifice 200 million people to achieve the final success of the revolution." If these words really become a reality, how terrible is Mao Zedong's cruelty! He simply wants to turn 200 million people into cannon fodder; besides exposing Mao's hideous face, there is really no reason to find it!</p>
<p>Today, the people need peace and need rest, which is an iron fact after the war. According to the current domestic and international situation, peaceful democracy is the only trend! There is absolutely no room for strong debate. We only have a political solution to gain legal status, lead the people to the road of prosperity and happiness, and then there is a way out!</p>
<p>Disregarding the interests of the people, treating the people as capital for war, and driving the people to the battlefield as cannon fodder will definitely be opposed by the people one day. We have always advocated opposing domestic civil war and opposing treating the people as cannon fodder. The country is composed of the people. We love the people and consider everything for the benefit of the people. The people want to live and work in peace and not be cannon fodder for the Mao Zedong faction. Only by supporting the Emergency Committee and joining hands with us can we launch a struggle against Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Stop the domestic civil war and realize democracy!</p>
<p>Oppose treating the people as cannon fodder!</p>
<h3>The Kuomintang Central Political Committee Holds its First Meeting Today; The Main Topic is to Discuss Political Policies</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The first meeting of the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang is scheduled to be held at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 28th. The committee was recently decided to be restored by the Central Standing Committee. Its main task is to discuss the policies that the Kuomintang should take on political issues. In addition to the 25 members elected by the Central Standing Committee on the 17th, all Kuomintang party members who serve as government officials, the Chief of Staff of the National Government, and members of the Central Standing Committee are ex officio members of the committee. According to the organizational law, the chairman of the committee is concurrently held by the Director-General.</p>
<h3>US China Policy to be Finalized: Truman and Marshall to Discuss, Announcement Possible Before End of June</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 27th] According to well-informed sources here today, the issue of American policy toward China may be one of the least urgent Far Eastern matters awaiting Marshall's attention. State Department officials predict that Marshall and President Truman will begin reviewing the US stance on China around June 30th, before the expiration of the frozen US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China. They stated that this review would take into account Chairman Chiang's appointment of Sun Ke as Vice Chairman and Zhang Qun as Premier of the Executive Yuan to broaden the base of his government. However, they were unwilling to speculate whether this review would relax the US's already announced policy that the US must wait for Chairman Chiang's regime to democratize before providing economic assistance. Their unanimous opinion was that the "wait-and-see" policy should continue for at least another two months. State Department officials predict that Marshall will decide on the timing of the Japan conference in the coming weeks. They are currently unaware whether the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to make any significant progress will cause further delays in convening a conference to draft a peace treaty related to Japan. The US State Department had assumed that the US might propose holding this conference in Washington or San Francisco this autumn. This assumption was based on the belief that the greatest difficulty for the four foreign ministers in reaching an agreement on the German and Austrian treaties could be resolved at the Moscow conference, but this belief has now been proven false.</p>
<p>It was then believed that after the United Nations General Assembly convened in New York in September of this year, the US authorities could shift their attention to the Japan issue. Now that no agreement has been reached on the German and Austrian issues, the Foreign Ministers Conference must be reconvened in London, and some officials believe that the Japanese peace conference will be postponed until at least next spring. Other officials believe that even if the Allied nations continue to dispute European affairs this autumn, the US should still prepare to convene the conference this autumn as originally planned. Therefore, Marshall's opinion is eagerly awaited by all parties, as President Truman will undoubtedly listen to his opinion.</p>
<p>Regarding other Far Eastern issues that Marshall must decide on, there are issues involving Korea and China. However, people here cannot determine whether Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's acceptance of his invitation to reconvene the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea is a sincere acceptance, as Molotov still clearly insists on excluding certain Korean groups from participating in the Korean interim government. The unanimous opinion here is that the resumption of the meeting may be hopeless. However, at the same time, most officials admit that if the meeting cannot be convened, it will give the Soviets a favorable opportunity for propaganda. This may be what Marshall wants to avoid. Marshall should also decide when to submit the State Department and War Department's plan to aid Korea with $450 million to Congress for discussion. Officials here say that regardless of the outcome of US-Soviet negotiations, the economic aid plan for Korea will be requested to be passed by Congress. However, they also said that the timing of this request to Congress would be decided after Marshall consults with President Truman. According to the original steps, it was intended to submit the request for aid to Korea as soon as Congress passed the aid plan for Greece and Turkey.</p>

<h3>271 US Navy Ships to be Transferred to China by Truman's Order, Delegation Sent to Assist Chinese Navy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] President Truman today issued an executive order directing Secretary of the Navy Forrestal to transfer 271 surplus US Navy ships, ship equipment, floating docks, etc., to China, and to send a delegation led by Du Hua to assist the Chinese Navy. The law authorized by the US authorities for the Secretary of the Navy to implement was passed by the previous Congress to help China expand and maintain its navy. Although the previous Congress passed this bill in July of last year, today's action is still to implement this plan to maintain China's navy, which has been delayed until now due to the clarification of the Chinese political situation. Truman's order today gives Marshall the final decision-making power, as the Secretary of the Navy is instructed to handle this matter, but still needs the consent of the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State believes at any time that the transfer of ships or equipment is not conducive to the public interest, then the transfer should be stopped. The contents of the President's order are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Allocate 271 surplus smaller naval vessels and the necessary floating docks to China at no cost. (2) These ships and floating docks should be repaired and equipped, and China should pay for all equipment needed for their use and maintenance in cash. (3) Deliver to China the plans, blueprints, other documents and reports related to these ships and floating docks, and send China non-confidential technical reports and recommendations for establishing and maintaining the Chinese Navy. (4) Train Chinese personnel to use these ships and floating docks, and other naval personnel deemed appropriate by the Secretary of the Navy. (5) Plan to send up to 800 US Navy or Marine Corps officers and up to 200 enlisted personnel to assist the Chinese Navy. Navy officials said that the number of ships to be allocated to China in the first batch and the schedule for their allocation are now being drafted.</p>
<p>The bill to allocate ships to China is the Vinson Act, which was passed by Congress last year, but stipulates that the President shall not allocate battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, or submarines to China without the consent of Congress. The US Navy planned to allocate these 271 ships to China in February of last year, while this bill was still under consideration in Congress. These include six escort destroyers, six buoy and marker supply ships, 217 landing craft, six motor gunboats, four 136-foot submarine chasers, six 173-foot submarine chasers, ten 110-foot submarine chasers, three oil tankers, one survey ship, two repair ships, two floating docks, and eight motor minesweepers or submarine chasers. A Navy official told a Central News Agency reporter that some of the ships allocated to China under the Lend-Lease Act will also be included in these 271 ships allocated to China by the Secretary of the Navy under the President's order. He also said that the ships could be delivered to China as soon as the training of Chinese sailors in the use of these ships is completed and Marshall approves of it.</p>
<p>Personnel to Receive Japanese Reparations Warships Depart in Three Batches</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of the Navy is stepping up preparations for the work of receiving Japanese warships. In addition to deciding to send two naval colonels to Japan in advance to make arrangements, it is heard that the receiving personnel will depart in three batches. The total number of the first batch of Japanese reparations warships will reach 64, which will be distributed by the four countries, of which China will receive 16.</p>
<h3>I Lodge Strong Protest with France Regarding French Aircraft Bombing Chinese Nationals in Vietnam: Should Bear Full Responsibility, Punish Perpetrators, and Compensate</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] French aircraft in Vietnam bombed Chinese nationals again, causing more than 100 casualties. Our government has lodged a strong protest with the French side in Nanjing, Paris, and Saigon, respectively. According to reliable information obtained from Chinese community groups and officials in Vietnam, five French military aircraft flew over Yonglian City, Yonglong Province, in southern Vietnam at 4:00 PM on the 15th of this month, and bombed the Yihe Valley, the second concentrated area for Chinese nationals in the city, killing three Chinese nationals and injuring one. At 9:00 AM the next morning, three French aircraft flew over the area again and bombed heavily. The Yihe Valley warehouse was hit, killing more than 100 Chinese nationals seeking refuge and injuring more than a dozen. In the past, Yonglian City had planned to implement a scorched-earth policy, forcing residents to evacuate. Our Chinese nationals specially set up two concentrated areas near the city, hanging the national flag high to identify them, and had formally notified the French side to provide special protection and not to drop bombs over the concentrated areas. Our Consulate General had also written to the French Commissioner in Southern Vietnam to forward the notification to the French military authorities, requesting special attention. Therefore, the French side should bear full responsibility for this tragedy. After hearing the report, our Consul General in Saigon, Yin Fengzao, immediately lodged a strong protest with the French side, and sent officials to lead doctors to the area where the incident occurred to handle the aftermath and investigate the details. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a strong protest with the French Embassy in China, and has telegraphed Ambassador Qian stationed in France to take similar steps, demanding that the French side earnestly acknowledge responsibility, fulfill France's promise to protect Chinese nationals, and promptly punish the perpetrators and provide compensation.</p>
<h3>Li Zhuchen Writes to Urge Prohibition of Exporting Raw Salt to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Industrial magnate Li Zhuchen recently published a speech entitled "To Save the Crisis of China's Chemical Industry, the Export of Raw Salt Must Be Absolutely Prohibited." He estimates that to make the chemical industry prosper, the domestic minimum annual demand for salt is 200,000 tons, while China's largest salt factory, Yongli, only produced 60,000 tons before the war. The factory was occupied by the Japanese for eight years, and the machinery was severely damaged. Although efforts have been made to repair it after the takeover, the current output is still less than half of what it was before the war. Therefore, it is still necessary to increase production by 170,000 tons to meet the needs of the national chemical industry. Therefore, he makes another appeal to prohibit the export of raw salt to Japan.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon Petition Again Against Business Profits Tax</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] After the Direct Tax Committee's appeal to the Hong Kong authorities and the British government failed, the meeting on the afternoon of the 26th passed a resolution to telegraph the British government again to petition: requesting the Hong Kong authorities to accept the method of replacing profits tax with business license tax proposed by the committee. The committee initially thoroughly opposed the four types of direct taxes proposed by the Hong Kong government: property tax, business profits tax, salary income tax, and interest tax. Finally, its attitude tended to be moderate, only opposing the business profits tax. The committee's Standing Committee is scheduled to visit the Secretary for Chinese Affairs on the 29th to explain the views of the overseas Chinese, and draft another petition to the Hong Kong authorities, which will be submitted to the Governor of Hong Kong on the 30th.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Representative in Philippines Discusses Philippine Attitude Towards Handling Repatriation of Overseas Chinese as Unconventional</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 26th] A local evening newspaper quoted a senior diplomatic source as saying: The Philippines' "diplomatic reputation" abroad may be seriously affected by the Philippine government's failure to properly handle UNRRA's request. UNRRA had previously requested the Philippine government to allow Chinese nationals who are currently stranded in Xiamen and who were indeed residents of the Philippines before the war to return to the Philippines as soon as possible. The newspaper said: The current lukewarm response of the Philippine government to the requests that the overseas Chinese can make through UNRRA is generally considered extremely inappropriate by diplomatic personnel here. UNRRA Representative in China Ganis refused to express what possible reactions the Philippine government's lukewarm attitude would cause in Washington in the future. He said: He personally believes that the Philippine government's attitude is unconventional and fundamentally contrary to the spirit of cooperation shown by other UNRRA member states in the work of repatriating displaced people around the world (this is one of the main tasks undertaken by UNRRA). Ganis clarified a previous report saying: The number of overseas Chinese that UNRRA requested the Philippine government to repatriate was only 4,000 people, and the figure of 7,600 people was a misrepresentation. The number of 7,600 people was the number of overseas Chinese repatriated to China by UNRRA last year. These overseas Chinese were sent to the Philippines by the Japanese during the occupation period to work as coolies, and the 4,000 overseas Chinese waiting to be repatriated to the Philippines left the Philippines before the war, or were forcibly transported to China by the Japanese during the occupation period, or avoided returning to China due to the oppression of the Japanese army during the war.</p>

<h3>National Highway Network Plan Includes Four Base Lines and Six Longitudinal and Latitudinal Lines, Plans to Complete Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Three Lines This Year</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Xi Xian, Director of the Engineering Department of the National Highway Administration, said: The currently planned national highway network includes four national highway base lines: (1) East-West Line, from Shanghai to Lhasa, (2) North-South Line, from Kowloon through Beijing to the Northeast, (3) Southeast to Northwest Line, from Fuzhou to the Xinjiang border, (4) Southwest to Northeast Line, from Nanning to Shenyang. Secondly, there are six longitudinal lines, six latitudinal lines, and multiple connecting lines. In addition to planning to complete the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Hangzhou, and Shanghai-Hangzhou three lines this year, it is also planned to build a line from Beijing through Wuhu, Tunxi, Nanchang, and Changsha to Changde, and at the same time, a line from Fuzhou through Nanchang to Wuchang is also in the planning. However, current prices are rising daily. The construction of bridges on the Beijing-Shanghai line requires more than 10 million yuan per meter, and the most severely damaged highways in the past were still bridges. Therefore, the construction hope is like this, but the budget is really too alarming.</p>
<h3>Seeking Reconstruction of Guling After Disaster, Requires Construction Costs of 23.4 Billion, Relief Goods and Materials Have Been Transported for Distribution</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guling, 26th] After the unprecedented fire in Guling, the victims are cleaning up the remaining debris. A small number of shopkeepers have built small houses on the ruins of the robbery to reorganize their old businesses. There are 495 victim households, totaling 1,667 people, who are all living in Hu Jinfang, Yan Renji, and the church, relying entirely on the porridge provided by the Administration Bureau for their livelihoods. Wu Shihan, Director of the Bureau, has rushed back from Hankou to preside over the relief work, and has drafted a Guling reconstruction plan, expecting to rebuild the main street, new street, and back street within two months. However, due to the limited financial resources on the mountain, the progress of the project is not without difficulty. According to preliminary surveys, the estimated construction area of the disaster area is 48.8 mu [unit of area], requiring 7.5 million yuan per mu. The new plan covers an area of 52 mu and requires construction costs of 23.4 billion yuan. For the urgent relief of the fire, the provincial government allocated 30 million yuan. In addition to the 10 million yuan advanced by the Administration Bureau, the remaining funds will be supervised and distributed by provincial officials, with 20,000 for large households and 10,000 for small households.

<h3>Geological Survey of Hangzhou Bay Discovers Ancient Coastline</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 27th] Sheng, a technician from the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, conducted a geological survey in Hangzhou Bay. Recently, he discovered pottery shards from the Spring and Autumn period, one at the north bank of Qin Zhushan, one at the outside beach of Xunan Tantuan, and one about three li northeast of Wutuan. Therefore, it is determined that the section from Dushan to Qin Kanpu was fully land, and the Wangpan Mountain area was the ancient coastline of the Qin Dynasty in the 2nd century BC. The coastline of the Tang Kaiyuan period, the 8th century, was also here, and the ancient Hangzhou Bay waterway passed through Xida Die. The changes from the sea to the mulberry field are very great. According to Sheng, he believes that it is most ideal to follow the ancient road for the century-old plan of the Qiantang River. Although 500 kilometers of soil will be destroyed, the current road on the north bank can increase by 1,500 kilometers in one or two years.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Evaluation of the New Banking Law</h3>
<p>The banking industry in modern society is related to public welfare. Although banks are established with capital raised by shareholders, they absorb the savings of people from all walks of life and then use them. Therefore, the safety of banking operations not only affects all shareholders but also affects the general public. As a result, the government must regulate banks to ensure social and financial stability. Although the organization of banks can be based on the Company Law, the regulation of banking operations and the protection of public rights depend on the implementation of the Banking Law.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government, in view of the importance of banking operations, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Banking Registration Regulations and Implementing Rules in January and April of the 18th year of the Republic (1929). The purpose was to restrict the establishment of banks with poor organization, insufficient capital, and improper operations, in order to prevent problems before they occur. In March of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the National Government promulgated the Banking Law, consisting of 51 articles, which strictly regulated all aspects of banks, including the organization, minimum capital requirements, establishment approval procedures, scope of operations, publication of business reports, procedures for suspension of operations and liquidation, approval for capital increases, reorganizations, and the establishment of branch banks, and penalties for violations. However, this law was never implemented, and the old Banking Law focused on commercial banks. Therefore, on July 4 of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the National Government also promulgated the Savings Bank Law. After the War of Resistance, in order to adapt to the wartime environment and meet the needs of the war, the Ministry of Finance promulgated ten articles of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Banks during the Emergency Period" in August of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). In December of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the Ministry of Finance, recognizing the need for further management of silver houses and money shops, supplemented and revised the previously promulgated measures to 15 articles, which were promulgated and implemented on December 9. Since then, all silver houses and money shops in the country, from operations to profit distribution, from institutions to employees, from branches to trade associations, have been separately regulated and strictly controlled. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, there were no major financial fluctuations in the rear, and the government's control contributed to this. After the restoration, the social situation changed, and the economy returned to peacetime. The Legislative Yuan was ordered to reorganize the Banking Law. Over the course of a year, it was revised seven times, and it was finally decided by the Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan on April 12 of this year, and then discussed in detail at the Sixth Court Assembly, completing the first reading on the 17th. Subsequently, the Silver Industry Association and the Shanghai Money Shop Association put forward a number of opinions, requesting adoption. After accepting the opinions of the private sector, the Legislative Yuan finally passed the third reading on April 24, and it will soon be promulgated and implemented by the National Government.</p>
<p>The new Banking Law consists of ten chapters and 119 articles, covering the organization of banks, the definition of operations, the general principles and penalties that apply, and the registration and licensing of banks. The operations of banks, trust companies, money shops, and foreign banks, as well as the management they should be subject to, are listed in separate chapters. From a legislative technique perspective, the Banking Law can be said to be a meticulously structured law by the Legislative Yuan, and the most complete code in commercial law. From a legislative spirit perspective, the enactment of the Banking Law creates a new era for China's banking science and banking industry system. It not only implements passive management of banks, but also actively guides the use of funds and the safe and stable direction of operations, in line with national financial policies, and promotes the healthy development of banking operations. This is indeed very different from the spirit of past laws and regulations. The important principles and spirit are evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Banks are essentially a type of company, so the Banking Law stipulates that the procedures for the organization system, business registration, and application for licensing of banks shall follow the provisions of the Company Law. In this sense, the Banking Law can be said to be a subsidiary law of the Company Law. The Banking Law adopts an equal spirit for commercial banks, industrial banks, savings banks, trust companies, and money shops, and generally regards them as banks. Companies and firms engaged in banking operations are also regarded as banks and must be registered in accordance with the law, and their activities are subject to legal regulation. This has a major significance in stabilizing social finance.</p>
<p>(2) In the past, the government's management of banks focused on ex-post inspection or inspection during the course of operations. The Banking Law has a guiding nature for the development of banking operations, so various banks are categorized and operate according to their respective types. Both deposits and loans are subject to substantive regulations. Banks enjoy rights in accordance with the law, and banks fulfill obligations in accordance with the law, fairly and impartially, which truly has the spirit of banking professionalism.</p>
<p>(3) Commercial banks focus on flexibility, industrial banks focus on stability, savings banks focus on the safety of depositors, trust companies focus on adhering to contracts, and money shops focus on customs, and give priority to developing into the banking industry. Each type of bank has its own professionalism. Branches and sub-branches cannot be set up freely and must pay attention to local needs. Therefore, branches must be established in response to needs and not for their own convenience. This is beneficial to the national and local economic development.</p>
<p>(4) In order to protect financial stability and social security, the reserve funds of banks should be deposited in the bank's vault or in national banks in accordance with legal ratios. Banks should store guarantee reserve funds in accordance with legal ratios for the deposits they receive and should not illegally withdraw them. This not only protects the rights and interests of depositors but also eliminates illegal speculation by banks. Therefore, the Banking Law does not control the activities of banks in advance or afterward, but only makes legislative prevention. At the same time, Article 44 further stipulates that "In order to protect the interests of depositors, banks should jointly establish a deposit insurance organization." All of this is to prevent risks in advance. It is expected that the credit of banks will be very strong in the future.</p>
<p>(5) The Banking Law also has provisions for personnel. Bank executives or employees shall not make credit loans in any way, and shall not accept commissions from depositors or lenders. Violators will be punished. This is to promote the spirit of public service and law-abiding among bank employees. If it can be effectively implemented, it will be sufficient to improve work efficiency and rectify and prevent the occurrence of private harm to public affairs. This personnel regulation is of great importance, and the competent authorities should have strict ex-post inspections in order to be successful.</p>
<p>(6) The Banking Law also has an important feature, that is, the establishment, registration, and special privileges of foreign banks in China, and the use of funds are listed in special chapters. At the same time, it stipulates that foreign banks in China shall limit their receipts and payments to Chinese currency, which is a management system that independent countries should have. The spirit of this system is extremely reasonable and needs no further explanation.</p>
<p>The above comments are only a brief summary. The Banking Law is logically correct and the measures are detailed. We should have a good evaluation. It is hoped that after the National Government promulgates and implements it, the competent authorities will take administrative measures in accordance with the law and put the banking industry on the right track. This is beneficial to public rights, social security, and financial stability. It is hoped that it will be implemented as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Truman Personally Went to the Airport to Welcome Marshall's Return to Washington; Last Night's White House Meeting Had Far-Reaching Impact; The Truman Doctrine May Be Further Advanced in the Future</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] US Secretary of State General Marshall arrived here at 3:42 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time) by plane from Moscow. Those who went to the airport to greet him included President Truman himself, Commerce Secretary Harriman, Democratic Senator Connally, senior US government officials, and representatives of the diplomatic corps. When General Marshall got off the plane and shook hands with President Truman, cheers erupted from the crowd, and photographers scrambled to take pictures. General Marshall immediately made a brief speech, saying: "I have completed an important mission in Moscow, which is of great importance not only to the United States but also to the entire world. I hope the world will soon become more pleasant. My impression of the United States is getting better and better. I am very happy to return to my country today, and I am extremely honored to have the President come to the airport to greet me." President Truman replied: "I am very satisfied with General Marshall's achievements in Moscow. I know that the people of the country will be satisfied when they hear General Marshall's broadcast speech on the evening of the 28th of this month, reporting on the progress of the Foreign Ministers' Conference." The President and General Marshall then drove to the White House for dinner together. General Marshall then took a plane to Pinehurst City, North Carolina to meet his wife, and will return to Washington tomorrow to attend an important meeting convened by President Truman. Leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties, cabinet members, and senior State Department officials will attend the meeting. General Marshall will not issue any other statements before his broadcast speech on the evening of the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and congressional leaders will meet tonight at the White House to hear Secretary Marshall's report on his trip to Moscow. What congressional leaders are most concerned about is Stalin's views on the Truman Doctrine, as expressed to Secretary Marshall. Stalin's reaction may determine the next step in the US government's plan to provide assistance to countries threatened by communism. In addition to Greece and Turkey, Korea, Iran, Iraq, India, and Egypt have or will request US assistance. The White House and Congress are preparing to establish institutions to study the necessary steps and the funds required. Unofficial estimates put the total cost of assistance at $5 billion. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote next Wednesday on the establishment of a committee to continue studying the proposed aid requests. General Marshall's first administrative measure after returning to the country will be to establish a design bureau, headed by Kennan, a leading expert on Soviet affairs. After the results of Marshall's meeting with Stalin are presented to congressional leaders, if it is proven that the United States still needs to provide assistance to other countries, President Truman is prepared to send another message to Congress, proposing a plan to assist countries other than Greece and Turkey. The State Department is studying a plan to assist Korea. Unofficial estimates put the amount of assistance at $540 million, to be paid in three installments. In addition, indirect assistance that can reduce the economic burden on Britain and France is also under discussion. The failure of the Moscow Conference will further deepen the rift between the eastern and western parts of Germany. Due to Molotov's rejection of France's demands for the Saar region, France's likelihood of joining the Anglo-American zone in Germany has increased compared to before. If so, the huge occupation costs borne by Britain and France may be partially shared by the United States.</p>
<h3>Total Value of US Foreign Aid Reaches $15.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The Office of the Budget has just released the total value of civilian foreign aid approved or prepared to be approved by the United States since the end of World War II, totaling $15.567 billion, excluding military aid. The aid items are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Loans to the UK of $3.75 billion, to be repaid in installments over 50 years. (2) Direct allocation of surplus materials for civilian relief, $824 million. (3) Relief plans for the occupied areas of Japan, Korea, Germany, and Austria, totaling $1.45 billion. (4) Export-Import Bank loans to foreign countries of $2.0117 billion, to be repaid in installments over 30 years. (5) Transfer of surplus materials, estimated at $1.03 billion. (6) Aid under the Post-War Lend-Lease Act, valued at $1.848 billion. (7) Sale of ships, $107 million. (8) Aid to the Philippines, $695 million, of which only a portion will be repaid in the future. (9) Aid through international organizations such as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), $2.617 billion. (10) Post-UNRRA foreign aid, $350 million. (11) International Bank shares, $635 million. (12) International Refugee Organization fund, $75 million. (13) Aid to Greece, $150 million (excluding military aid).</p>
<p>In addition, contributions of $2.75 billion to the International Monetary Fund to stabilize the currencies of other countries are not included in the scope of relief.</p>
<h3>US to Lend $20 Million to Hungary</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 26th] According to reliable sources: the United States is about to announce a loan of $21 million to Hungary. This loan is different from the previous two loans (totaling $15 million), not only can it be used by the Hungarian government to purchase US surplus materials within Europe, but it can also be used to purchase US goods (what kind of US goods are still unknown). This loan is also unrelated to the $7 million loan granted by two US private banks to Hungary for the purchase of cotton textiles. According to Hungarian sources today, this loan was not requested by the Hungarian government from the United States. It is also reported that this loan is not within the scope of the $350 million that the United States intends to use to assist countries such as Poland and Hungary.</p>
<h3>US State Department Expenses Increase Tenfold</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The US diplomatic community, like ordinary housewives, is also hit by rising living costs. The State Department's expenses are currently ten times higher than in 1939, and are still increasing. Rising prices, salary adjustments, and the United States' leading position in international affairs have all made the State Department's expenses increasingly large. According to statistics, the State Department's expenses in 1939 were only $17.122 million, at which time there were a total of 5,261 civil servants, while the current number of State Department personnel has reached 21,000, and its expenses can be imagined. It is difficult to predict when the increase in US diplomatic expenses can stop, and it depends on future international relations.</p>

<h3>Turkish Cabinet Meeting Discusses US Aid to Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 26th] Regarding US aid to Turkey, it is reported that the Turkish cabinet has been meeting for days to discuss the matter. After the US Ambassador to Turkey, Wilson, returns here from the United States next week, the Turkish government will conduct negotiations with him.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Expresses Disappointment with the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 26th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King returned to the country from the United States today. According to him, he expressed disappointment with the Moscow Conference, but hoped that it would facilitate future continued negotiations, as Marshall hoped.</p>
<h3>Rumors that the Four Powers Have Secretly Decided on Yugoslavia's Demands on Austria</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 26th] The Deputy Minister of Property Management and Economic Planning of Austria said today when he returned here from Moscow: The Austrian delegation believes that Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Carinthia have been decided by the four foreign ministers in a secret meeting. The Austrian delegation was led by Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, who told reporters upon arrival here that he could not make any statements to the press before discussing with Austrian Prime Minister Figl. In explaining the US position on the issue of German assets in Austria, he denied that the United States had rejected the Soviet compromise plan, which had been called acceptable to Austria. He also said: The Austrian government is willing to return 81 enterprises in eastern Austria to the Soviet Union, as long as the operation of these enterprises complies with Austrian law.</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister Comments on the Outcome of the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 26th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, who recently returned here from Moscow, gave a radio address tonight commenting on the outcome of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, saying in brief: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has made considerable progress, and the procedures it has formulated can enable the drafting of the peace treaty to be handled quickly. From a practical point of view, we have no reason to express dissatisfaction with the Foreign Ministers Conference, but from a psychological point of view, it is not. The way the Foreign Ministers Conference handled the Austrian issue completely violated Austria's desire to become a free and independent country, and a free Austria will not rely on the policies of the Allied countries, nor will it be willing to rely on the policies of the Allied countries to be reborn.</p>
<h3>United Nations Special Assembly Opens: Discussions on the Palestine Issue, Brazilian Representative Expected to Assume Chairmanship</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Special Assembly will open tomorrow to discuss the Palestine issue. The chief representative of Brazil, Oswaldo, is expected to assume the chairmanship, succeeding the head of the Belgian delegation, Spaak. It is reported that the five major powers and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have approved this proposal. Simultaneously, the Assembly must also elect seven vice-chairmen. The five major powers are ex-officio vice-chairmen, with the addition of one vice-chairman from either the Philippines or India and one vice-chairman from a South American country. The sixth and seventh vice-chairmen will replace the previous vice-chairmen from the Union of South Africa and Venezuela. The Executive Committee of the Assembly will also be renewed, comprising Canada, Sweden, Egypt, Czechoslovakia, and Mexico, replacing the previous Uruguay, Ukraine, Syria, Panama, and New Zealand, with only Poland retaining its seat. The Assembly is expected to last three or four weeks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 26th] The United Nations Special Assembly on the Palestine issue is scheduled to open on the 28th. Britain and other major powers may be forced to express their positions. Britain and the United States are prepared to insist that the agenda of the Special Assembly be limited to discussing the organization of the investigation committee. However, some representatives will certainly raise other difficult issues. The Polish delegation insists that Britain and the other four major powers should be included in any special committee. Poland's position, which sometimes reflects the attitude of the Soviet Union, is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Soviet Attitude Particularly Noteworthy</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] Observers expect the Soviet Union to support the demand for Palestine's independence during the United Nations Special General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue. However, to date, the Soviet Union has not indicated whether it will support the Jewish or Arab faction. Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Novikov, stated in the Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly last November that the Soviet Union believed Palestine should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations or achieve independence. Now that the Soviet Union has boycotted the Trusteeship Council, it is expected that it will no longer mention trusteeship in the Special General Assembly but will instead advocate Palestine's independence. Novikov stated last November that Britain had granted independence to Transjordan, so why not grant independence to Palestine? According to people close to the Soviet representatives, the Soviet Union still opposes the formal demands of the Zionist movement. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has great interests in the oil resources and strategic location of the Middle East, and it also has a large Muslim population domestically. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union may support the Arab faction rather than the Zionist movement, which is controlled by American capitalists. It is expected that in the Special General Assembly, the Soviet Union will demand Palestine's independence and the establishment of a proportional representative government for both Arabs and Jews, which would mean Palestine would be ruled by the Arab majority. Recently, Soviet Representative Gromyko and Syrian Representative Khoury expressed mutual support in the Security Council, thus revealing the Soviet Union's inclination on the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>Indian Support for Arab Policy</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 26th] The Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian Interim Government, Nehru, and the President of the Muslim League, Jinnah, have notified the Arab League that the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League fully agree with the policies adopted by the Arab countries in Palestine and will support the discussion of the Palestine issue at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Thailand's Accession Ceremony Held Today at the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 26th, United Press] The ceremony for admitting Thailand to the United Nations will be held on the 28th of this month during the special session of the United Nations General Assembly convened to discuss the Palestine issue. It was approved near the close of the 1946 General Assembly. The same assembly also approved the admission of Sweden, Iceland, and Afghanistan.</p>

<h3>Austin's Speech: Advocates a Firm and Calm Stance Towards the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cleveland, 26th] The United States Representative to the United Nations, Austin, delivered a speech at the International Conference of Railway Workers today, demanding that the United States continue to adopt a firm and calm attitude in dealing with the Soviet Union. Austin stated that this is the only way to go. The control of atomic energy should have the possibility of achieving an effective organization. Austin predicted that an agreement with the Soviet Union on this matter would be reached "soon." The United States has a great influence on the United Nations' decision on whether peace must be achieved. He also listed the following policies that the United States must adopt to promote collective security: (1) Fully uphold the United Nations Charter, resorting to force when necessary; (2) Utilize the coordination steps already established by the United Nations; (3) Assist countries devastated by war to restore their economic strength; (4) The United States must abandon any unilateral disarmament plan "caused by malice, hoping to reduce our budget."</p>
<h3>Clark to Return to the United States Soon: To Assume Important Post as Commander of the Sixth Army; Keyes Succeeds as U.S. Commissioner to Austria</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 26th] The Commander of the U.S. Forces in Austria, General Clark, stated today during a reception for reporters that the failure of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference will not change his plan to return to the United States to assume the post of Commander of the Sixth Army.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 26th] The U.S. High Commissioner to Austria, General Clark, is scheduled to depart for his home country on May 17th and will assume an important post on the Pacific coast. According to his announcement to the press today, his position as High Commissioner to Austria will be succeeded by General Keyes. He also stated that he could not represent the United States at the Four Powers Commission to be held in Vienna on May 12 to discuss the Austrian peace treaty. Who will represent the United States in the future will depend on the appointment of Secretary of State Marshall. In addition, in response to reporters' questions, he said that the U.S. troops will only withdraw when other countries can also withdraw from Austria.</p>
<h3>Conservative Party Dissatisfied with Government: British Political Situation Becomes Tense; Cabinet to Undergo Partial Reorganization Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] Political figures here have recently stated that the British Labour Cabinet will carry out a partial reorganization before the Labour Party holds its annual conference, which is almost certain. This matter will be discussed by Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Lord President of the Council Morrison next week. The situation created by the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to achieve any concrete results will also be discussed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 26th] The government's counterattack against the Conservative Party's criticism today is rapidly evolving into a political war. Attorney General Wike and Fuel Minister Shinwell each delivered speeches, following the new approach adopted by Prime Minister Attlee yesterday, refuting Churchill personally and his Conservative Party. At the same time, Churchill wrote to the by-election candidates again condemning the current government's "squandering and mismanagement." Liberal Party President Houlden demanded that the party join forces with the Conservative Party to oust the Labour Party. The degree of political animosity is intensifying, and the Conservative Party is consolidating its financial strength, drafting new policy statements, and actively planning a speaking campaign to win over comrades. A key Labour official stated that the government has begun a "massive" speaking campaign against the Conservative Party and is prepared to respond to its criticisms "sternly." Government ministers have previously made public speeches, doing their best to explain socialist policies and the need for the entire nation to work hard to revitalize the economy after the war. Now, they have shifted their focus to engaging in direct attacks and defenses. Many ministers, provoked by the criticisms of the Conservative Party, feel the need to respond.</p>
<h3>Conservative Party Plans Completed: Industrial Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The Sunday Times reported today that the British Conservative Party will soon publish its industrial plan, which is 1,000 pages long. It reviews short-term and long-term plans and will include several proposals for cooperation between state-owned and private enterprises. The issue of wages is also discussed. This plan will oppose the Labour government's nationalization policy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] A by-election was held in Wroxton today. Former Prime Minister Churchill wrote to the Conservative candidate, severely criticizing the Labour Party for providing unachievable promises. "After six years of war, many people have forgotten the failures of the previous Labour cabinet, and many people are too young to remember. Therefore, they have been influenced by the Labour Party's promises and support the Labour Party's rule."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] MacArthur issued a message tonight, stating that the results of the general election in Japan have shown that the Japanese people firmly reject the leadership of the Communist Party. MacArthur's message was released through the General Headquarters Press Office.</p>
<p>Free Vote Reflects Public Opinion</p>
<p>It stated that in this election, millions of Japanese people, from factories, shops, and homes, from rural farms and railway districts, went to the polls to fulfill their new civic obligations without fear and voted freely. The basic question for the voters was to choose a political concept. The extreme right-wing totalitarianism, responsible for defeat and long-term oppression of civil rights, has been abandoned by the people. The extreme left-wing communist ideology still exists, and its leaders have tried their best to win public support. Since the beginning of the occupation, thousands of Communists have been released. This ideology (communism and its leaders) has been given the greatest freedom of political action, allowing for fair and open competition with democratic forces and beliefs. However, under the people's consideration, it has failed. The Japanese people firmly reject the leadership of the Communist Party and have overwhelmingly chosen the middle path, staying away from the two extremes, to ensure the preservation of freedom and the promotion of individual dignity.</p>
<p>Implementing the New Constitution Opens the Way</p>
<p>The national election has opened the way for the implementation of Japan's progressive new constitution, which is "one of the great spiritual movements" of mankind, enough to indicate "a new era in the Far East and to give the Japanese people another opportunity." The Japanese people have moved from slavery to a free life, "I believe they will not fail their new obligations." The Japanese people, with a cautious and sincere attitude, followed the rules and freely voted to elect candidates, and no one can object to them. This election is unprecedented in Japan's history, reflecting the free will of the majority of the people, rather than a few people acting arbitrarily and unilaterally. This is what democracy means. With the election having been held, the final preparatory steps necessary for the implementation of Japan's new constitution have been completed.</p>
<h3>Final Results of the Japanese General Election Announced: MacArthur Issues Special Message Emphasizing that the Communist Party Is Not Popular with the People; Japan's First Democratic Cabinet Likely to Be a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] As a result of this general election of members of the House of Representatives in Japan, the Socialist Party became the largest party, while the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party retreated to the second and third positions, respectively. Therefore, at the first Diet session to be convened on May 20, the political center will likely be based on the Socialist Party's Chairman Katayama, and Japan will establish a regime guided by a progressive socialist party. However, the Socialist Party, together with its left-wing party (the Communist Party), still cannot control an absolute majority of seats in the Diet. Therefore, it must seek cooperation with other political parties. As for the future trend of dealing with the situation, it will be (1) a coalition cabinet formed by the Socialist Party at the center, with the cooperation of the Social Democratic, Liberal, and National Cooperative parties; (2) a conservative cabinet formed by the cooperation of the Liberal Democratic and Conservative parties; (3) a coalition cabinet formed by the Socialist Party alone cooperating with the Liberal Party or the Democratic Party. Furthermore, after learning the results of the election, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama emphasized the theory of a coalition cabinet on the 26th, which suggests that the first democratic cabinet will soon be a coalition cabinet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] The Social Democratic Party members elected by the Japanese people to the first Diet, totaling 143, laid the foundation for a coalition government today. According to the new constitution, the coalition government must include socialists. The Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Yoshida has lost the largest number of seats, occupying only 133 seats. The Democratic Party led by Vice-Prime Minister Shidehara is third, occupying 126 seats. The number of seats for each party is listed below: Social Democratic Party 143 seats, Liberal Party 133 seats, Democratic Party 126 seats, National Cooperative Party (Conservative) 31 seats, Communist Party 4 seats, Minor Parties 16 seats, Independents 13 seats. There are only 14 female members in this session, 25 fewer than in the previous Diet.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Discusses the Political Situation in Korea</h3>
<p>Plans to Propose Establishing an Independent Government</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 26th] The leader of the Korean Democratic Party, Syngman Rhee, recently returned here from the United States. Today, he denied the statement in his talks reported by newspapers in Shanghai that President Truman had guaranteed a $600 million loan to Korea. It is reported that "Mr. Truman never guaranteed anything to me. I did not even meet with [him] during my recent trip to the United States. In my talks in Shanghai, I only said that the U.S. government is considering assisting the Korean people. If such assistance is realized, we would be happy to accept it." When discussing the Korean political situation, Rhee said that he would propose the establishment of a government to prevent negotiations by the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission from failing in the future, so that this government could negotiate with the Soviet Union. Rhee plans to urge the Provisional Assembly of South Korea to pass an election law to elect a congress or parliament. This body would formulate a constitution as the basis for an independent government in North or South Korea. If the negotiations by the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on the unification of Korea fail, the Koreans will advance the plan for an independent government. If the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate, the Korean government can appeal to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Wallace Returns to the United States</h3>
<p>Will Launch a National "Peace Movement"</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Wallace, who has been the most vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy, flew into LaGuardia Airport here today with the firm belief that his two-week "peace tour" in Europe was successful. Wallace said, "My trip to Europe was not to overthrow the Truman Doctrine, but to find out what kind of forces Europe is organizing after the path of peace. I feel that the people of Britain, Western Europe, and Scandinavia are good and enthusiastic people. Even more, they all unanimously hope for peace." Wallace also said that he planned to go to Washington today to launch a national "peace movement" and host a press conference on the afternoon of the 28th. He has decided to deliver speeches in New York and Chicago, and another speech in Los Angeles regarding the use of the "Hollywood Bowl" music venue.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the U.S. Senate Military Committee Condemns U.S. Military's Lack of Preparedness</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] The Chairman of the Senate Military Committee, Gurney, delivered a radio address yesterday, condemning the U.S. military's lack of preparedness to deal with any emergency in the occupied areas around the world. He stated: If we were to face a major crisis tomorrow, the U.S. troops in the occupied areas would certainly be overwhelmed by a major power. The United States now has neither troops that can be deployed to deal with major emergencies nor troops that can prevent them. Because the United States can only muster 300,000 people, and most of the one million soldiers are scattered in the occupied areas, undertaking their occupation or management tasks.</p>
<p>He also described the imaginary scenario of the United States encountering a military attack in the future, believing that the greatest danger lies in internal sabotage and long-range aerial bombing. Long-range bombers and rocket bombs can deal a fatal blow to the United States' major industries. This would be the initial offensive once a war breaks out. What follows could be the invasion of the United States by paratroopers and the full-scale frontal offensive of the army.</p>
<h3>American Industrial Areas to Implement Evacuation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Congress is considering a bill that would lay the foundation for the re-designation and evacuation of industrial areas as a national defense measure.</p>
<h3>Britain and Poland Conclude Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 27th] New York formally announced today after listening to British broadcasts; Britain and Poland have concluded a trade agreement for a period of three years, which will be formally approved in May. The agreement stipulates that Poland will ship goods worth approximately 23 million pounds and 250,000 tons of coal to Britain. The goods are mostly food, and the coal is for use by British ships in the Baltic Sea. Britain will supply Poland with goods worth 35 million pounds, most of which are machinery.</p>
<h3>Indian Constituent Assembly Convenes Third Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 27th Broadcast: The Indian Constituent Assembly will convene its third meeting on Monday. The Muslim League and most tribes are still refusing to participate, causing the hope of Indian constitution-making to fade. It is reported that the result of the talks between Muslim League leader Jinnah and Mountbatten is still a firm demand for the separation of India and Pakistan.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Leaves the United States for Britain</h3>
<p>To Inspect British and French Military Equipment</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] General Wei Lihuang left the United States for London by plane on the 26th to visit the military equipment of Britain and France. General Wei has been studying military affairs in the United States for several months and has now completed his research. He said that the Chinese army plans to adopt the best characteristics of the military systems of Britain, the United States, and France. General Wei is accompanied by his wife, daughter, and staff.</p>
<h3>Hungary Applies to Join the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] It has just been learned that the Hungarian government, through its ambassador to the United States, sent a note to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 22nd of this month, applying to join the United Nations as a member state.</p>
<h3>Prehistoric Skull Discovered in South Africa</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cape Town, South Africa, 26th] Archaeologist Dr. Broom of the Pretoria Museum recently discovered a prehistoric human skull in a cave in the Outer Transvaal Province, which confirms that humans evolved from apes. The doctor identified the bone as belonging to a 50-year-old woman, with a volume of 400 cubic centimeters.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Advises Britain and the United States to Abandon the Spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and Implement Alert on the Elbe River</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The "Observer" newspaper commented on the failure of the Moscow Conference, concluding that Britain and the United States should abandon the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, implement alert work on the Elbe River to make it a barrier against the communist tide, and conclude an agreement with the United States to keep Western Germany stable and self-sufficient. It stated: The merger of the British and American occupation zones has failed, and we should no longer miss the opportunity. To date, there are no real signs of economic recovery in the two occupation zones, and the food situation is extremely chaotic. The two sides have very different opinions on how to deal with this matter. Now, to solve this difficulty, it is urgent to restore the trade links between the Ruhr area, the Netherlands, and France. If we do not abandon the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and get rid of its restrictions and constraints, this policy will still have no hope of success. Now that the Moscow Conference has declared its failure, and the Soviet Union has refused to lift the four-power agreement on the disarmament of Germany, the ideological front in Germany has become clear, as if the northern border of Greece and Turkey has become an important weak point. It is important to know that hunger and disaster are the easiest places for communist propaganda to grow. Now that the United States is resisting the infiltration and aggression of communism around the world, it should not neglect to implement alert on the Elbe River.</p>
<h3>Current State of U.S.-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Special Translation by the Newspaper Compilation Office</p>
<p>The relationship between the two most powerful nations in the world has now reached a new historical stage, a stage where they openly declare mutual suspicion. How things will evolve in the future can only be speculated, and no definite predictions can be made.</p>
<p>The United States believes that the Soviet Union's expansionist and aggressive policies have reached a point where a showdown is necessary. The United States is prepared to use dollars, armaments, and troops as a backing for upholding democracy and opposing totalitarianism. The unwavering U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union has already materialized in Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>After Britain announced that its aid to Greece and Turkey would have to be greatly reduced starting at the end of March, President Truman immediately requested Congress to lend 400 million yuan to Greece and Turkey as relief. At the same time, the new U.S. policy must be implemented no later than March 31st. Congressional leaders unanimously agreed that by that time, a legal resolution should be established in response to President Truman's request.</p>
<p>The United States is Prepared to Take Action</p>
<p>The new situation of U.S.-Soviet antagonism has broken through American tradition and caused a drastic change in U.S.-Soviet relations. Truman said that mere speeches and diplomatic protests are no longer sufficient to protect democracy against aggressive forces, and that the United States now needs to take action. Truman meant that wherever the Soviet Union attempts to impose totalitarianism on other countries, the United States will take action there.</p>
<p>Truman's message to Congress did not call for a change in relations with the Soviet Union. President Truman did not mention the word "Soviet Union" in his speech. He only spoke of aggressors, but did not name them. At the same time, as far as the United States is concerned, it has always adhered to diplomatic etiquette. The Soviet Union has recalled its ambassadors stationed in Washington, London, and Paris for instructions, but declared that this action is temporary. The United States did not recall its ambassador to Moscow, and the U.S. representatives in the United Nations and the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers continue to negotiate with the Soviet representatives as usual. Superficially, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov continue to hold talks as if nothing had happened in Washington.</p>
<p>The intention of the United States is obviously to maintain normal U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations, without resorting to force, and without any implication of declaring war or severing ties. The United States intends to inform the Soviet Union that the United States is now prepared to use its resources to contain Soviet expansion and the spread of communism. Truman's speech was deliberately straightforward, concise, and clear, so that people could understand it at a glance, hoping that this candid statement could avoid the need for confrontation. In the past, some people doubted the foreign policy of the United States, but now that doubt has completely dissipated.</p>
<p>U.S.-Soviet Suspicion Becomes Overt</p>
<p>At the same time, diplomatic subtleties cannot conceal the suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding each other's intentions. The Greek issue is only a prelude to the United States' suspicion manifesting itself and the United States taking action.</p>
<p>The Hungarian issue did not attract as much attention as the Greek issue, because the United States has not yet mentioned taking action. However, the United States has lodged a serious protest against the Soviet Union's intention to force Hungary to establish a communist government.</p>
<p>Other issues, such as Soviet actions in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Iran, France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, and the Far East, have also aroused protests from the United States. The development of communism in Latin America has aroused the vigilance of the United States. In addition, in former enemy countries where U.S. and Soviet troops are facing each other, mutual suspicion is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's suspicion of capitalist America has been around for a long time and is now even more intense. According to Marx's definition, capitalist countries are bound to be aggressive, imperialistic, and creators of war. Such accusations from Moscow Radio were temporarily quieted during the war, but now they have returned to their old ways.</p>
<p>Soviet Newspapers Criticize Aid to Greece and Turkey</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's first reaction to Truman's speech was that the Soviet government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," compared the new U.S. policy to Hitler's policy. The newspaper accused Truman of using the same tactics as Hitler when he was about to seize a country in his words of requesting Congress to aid Greece and Turkey against the forces of violence.</p>
<p>Regarding the U.S. aid to the Chinese Nationalist government, the Soviet Union believes that it violates the interests of the Chinese people, so Molotov requested that the Chinese issue be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers for discussion.</p>
<p>In fact, as the United States sees it, Molotov's proposal is more related to Greece than to China. Molotov's proposal came before Truman's speech to Congress. He believed that Moscow's raising of the issue of China's civil war might make U.S. congressmen aware that the United States cannot promote China's unity and stability. Perhaps Molotov also believed that Marshall was the decision-maker of U.S. policy toward China. Therefore, Molotov hoped to spark debate on the Chinese issue in order to put Marshall in a difficult position, force the United States to take a defensive position in the Moscow conference, and sow seeds of doubt in the minds of congressmen who were about to decide on the issue of aid to Greece.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Molotov's strategy on the China issue and the discussion on the German issue were overshadowed by Truman's declaration of a new U.S. policy. Whether the news from Washington will strengthen or alleviate Soviet resistance is only known to the Soviet Union itself. Perhaps an answer can be found in the negotiations on the German and Austrian issues.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Americans, Germany is only one end of many conflicts between communist Soviet Union and capitalist United States, the fundamental conflict still lies in the United States and the Soviet Union themselves. Whether the United States and the Soviet Union can reconcile their conflicts has become a matter of the greatest concern to governments around the world. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly).</p>

<h3>Twenty Japanese War Criminals and Traitors Extradited from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday - One War Criminal Committed Suicide by Jumping into the Sea En Route Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>Six important Japanese war criminals and fourteen traitors who fled to Japan after the victory were extradited for interrogation after negotiations between our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan. They were escorted by U.S. military police to Taiwan, and then by 12 military police officers led by Lieutenant Platoon Leader Lai Yongming of the 4th Regiment of the Taiwan Military Police on the "Zhongxing" ship to Shanghai, arriving at the Zhongxing Wharf in Pudong at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. After receiving a telegram from the Taiwan Garrison Command, the Songhu Garrison Command had already dispatched Major Adjutant Ji Guohuang and ten soldiers to wait at the wharf. The war criminals and traitors disembarked one after another, with their heads bowed and speechless, as if they were overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present. The prisoners were then escorted onto the "Huadao" ship and arrived at Dongjia Wharf at 12:30 p.m., where they were taken by two prison cars to the Military Court of the First Pacification Zone. As it was Sunday yesterday, no one was on duty, so they were taken to the Shanghai High Court. The court accepted the fourteen traitors and detained them in the detention center. The six war criminals were temporarily detained in the garrison command detention center and will be transferred to the military court this morning.</p>
<p>Full List of Prisoners</p>
<p>The list of the six war criminals is as follows: Ryozo Fukuda, Navy Vice Admiral, former Commander of the Japanese Navy Fleet, with the Izumo warship as its flagship. Akira Nara, Army Lieutenant General, former Commander of the Hankou Dispatch Army. Kazuo Shirakawa, former diplomat stationed in "Manchukuo." Sadajiro Katsura, former consultant to the Kailuan Mining and Metallurgical Bureau. Hideomi Takahashi, Warrant Officer, formerly Colonel Masao Misaki. The list of the fourteen traitors is as follows: Qikang Bao, Shantong Chen, Guorui Fu, Qiguang Xie, Xiangliang Kong, Shanghuang Kang, Wenxiu Lin, Guoying Mi, Shukai Deng, Naihou Cao, Baozheng Wu, Xueting Ye, Dingjun Zeng, Hongjie Jiang.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the U.S. military police originally escorted seven Japanese war criminals from Japan to Taiwan by ship, but when the ship passed the waters of Ryukyu, one war criminal took advantage of the unpreparedness of the crowd and suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide. His name is not yet known.</p>

<h3>Families of Officers and Soldiers Who Died in the Fubo Gunboat Disaster Held a Press Conference Yesterday to Report and Appeal</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wang Hangmanjun, Zhu Cai Xiuzhang, Chen Cheng Lixia and other family members of officers and soldiers who died in the Fubo gunboat disaster held a press conference at the Civil Affairs Bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday and issued a written report, which is recorded as follows: Regarding the case of the Fubo warship being sunk by the China Merchants Bureau's Haimin ship, there have been continuous reports and comments in newspapers recently. We, the family members of the officers on the ship, are the direct relatives of the victims in this case. Although we are in extreme sorrow and grief, we are determined not to express our opinions publicly until the case is clarified. After more than a month of running around and inquiring, and after reading the indictment issued by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate against Dai Rulin, the captain of the Haimin ship, we believe that the facts of the case have become extremely clear. At this moment, there are various rumors, all with ulterior motives, hoping to confuse public opinion. At the same time, in today's society, money can still communicate with the gods, which is still unavoidable. We have already seen various signs and cannot help but feel the absurdity of the world. Fortunately, the public trial of this case is imminent, so we extend several meanings and urge public opinion to supervise the progress of this case and ensure a fair result:</p>
<p>Sinking the Fubo, Continuing to Move Forward</p>
<p>(1) Dai Rulin, the captain of the Haimin ship, admitted in the Shanghai Local Procuratorate's examination court that after the collision, the ship stopped for only a few minutes and continued to move forward. This point has already been stated in the indictment issued by the Local Procuratorate. Further evidence from the passengers of the Haimin ship is conclusive. At that time, the officers and soldiers of the "Fubo" were waiting for rescue in the water, but the Haimin ship moved forward, and the push plate agitated the waves even more, causing hundreds of navy officers and soldiers to be drowned. This point alone is enough to constitute Dai Rulin's crime under Article 128 of the Maritime Commerce Law.</p>
<p>Life-Saving Equipment, Mostly Not Used</p>
<p>(2) The Haimin ship attempted to escape after colliding with the Fubo, and only returned to rescue after being criticized by the passengers. It took several hours to go back and forth. When they met Mr. Jiao Dexiao, the engineer of the "Fubo," they did not provide effective rescue. At that time, the passengers on the customs ship were filled with anger and, in addition to blaming Captain Dai Rulin, they also encouraged the sailor Ma Fugen to go into the water to rescue him, fortunately saving Mr. Jiao Dexiao, the only survivor. There is already written proof of this from the testifying passengers. Furthermore, the Local Procuratorate inspected the Haimin ship and found that its life-saving equipment, except for two lifebuoys and two life rafts that were thrown into the sea at ordinary times, was not used at all. Moreover, when the lifebuoys and life rafts were thrown down, they were not tied with ropes, or they were tied too tightly (as testified by passengers). The captain of the China Merchants Bureau ship clearly had the intention of killing and destroying evidence, and he should undoubtedly be subject to the sanctions stipulated in Article 271 of the Criminal Law to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Failure to Rescue, Difficult to Cover Up Guilt</p>
<p>(3) The responsibility for the collision and Dai Rulin's failure to rescue are two completely different matters and cannot be confused. There will be a day when the responsibility for the collision is clarified, but Dai Rulin's failure to rescue will certainly still be tried and convicted by the Shanghai Local Court. Today, some people want to cover up the latter with the former, and their intention is very clear. The handling of this case is based on eyewitness testimony, and if the time is delayed for too long, the eyewitness testimony will inevitably be difficult.</p>
<p>Witnesses Will Feel Difficulties</p>
<p>(4) This time, the Shanghai Local Court will hold a public trial of this case on the 29th. When the news was released, the names of the witnesses were listed. This kind of action will cause difficulties for the witnesses. The witnesses are self-standing on the position of justice, but today it is difficult to avoid the influence of evil forces. Before, when the examination court was opened, a few witnesses had been disturbed in various ways, and now it is even more worrying.</p>
<p>(5) As the saying goes, "The Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high." We ask fair-minded people in society to lend their assistance from the standpoint of justice at any time.</p>

<h3>International Women Lawyers Association, China Branch, Established Yesterday - Creating a New Era in China's Judiciary</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China branch of the International Women Lawyers Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at the International Hotel Skyscraper. Over a hundred people attended, including Zheng Yuxiu, Qian Jianqiu, Wang Chonghui, Xie Guansheng, Dong XianGuang, Tian Shujun, Tong Daoyun, Yang Minghui, and Zha Liangjian. The meeting was chaired by Zheng Yuxiu, who stated in her brief speech: "The internationalization of women's organizations is an unprecedented event in the judicial field. The success of this association relies on the enthusiastic participation of everyone."</p>
<p>Advocating the Rule of Law, Consolidating Peace</p>
<p>I have two suggestions to offer today: (1) Our constitution has been established, and we must do our utmost to ensure its thorough implementation. We must promote the spirit of the rule of law at all times and in all places so that the country can move towards prosperity. This is the responsibility of us who study law. The main reason for world instability lies in the rule of law. Therefore, to consolidate world peace, we must promote the spirit of the rule of law.</p>
<p>Significant Meaning, Worth Celebrating</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui then spoke, saying, "The establishment of the China branch of the International Women Lawyers Association marks a new era in China's judiciary. Its significance is very important and worth celebrating. Whether in the international or domestic arena, law has a new trend, which is to be socialized and should be aimed at society. I wish the association success in seeking welfare for society."</p>
<p>Bright Future, Predicting Success</p>

<h3>Smooth and Fast - Director Yu Bingjian of the Telecommunications Bureau Broadcasts on the Shanghai Telecommunications Industry - Our Newspaper Holds Its Fourth Weekly Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Our newspaper held its fourth special Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Greater China Continental Radio Station, inviting Mr. Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, to broadcast on "The Telecommunications Industry in Shanghai." The full text of his speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>"The Telecommunications Industry in Shanghai," from a historical perspective, can be divided into four periods: (A) The Budding Period, (B) The Development Period, (C) The War of Resistance Period, (D) The Reconstruction Period.</p>
<p>Budding Period</p>
<p>In the tenth year of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty, about seventy-six years ago, the submarine telegraph line of the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company, passing through Xiamen from Hong Kong to Shanghai, opened for business. Initially, it only accepted foreign language telegrams, but later it created a four-character code for Chinese telegrams. At the same time, the submarine line of the British Great Eastern Telegraph Company ran from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In the sixth year of Guangxu, Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Commerce of the Northern Ports and Governor-General of Zhili, received approval to establish the Tianjin-Shanghai Telegraph, establishing a telegraph bureau. This marked the beginning of Shanghai's state-owned telegraph industry. In the seventh year of Guangxu, the British-owned Duang Kee Foreign Firm established the China-Foreign Telephone Company in the former British Concession. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, the American Pacific Company extended its underwater line from Manila through Baoyu to Shanghai, setting up a bureau to send and receive telegrams. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, Germany laid an underwater line from Yap Island to Shanghai. In the thirty-second year of Guangxu, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau also operated the Shanghai Nanshi Zhabei telephone service, establishing the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. This marked the beginning of Shanghai's state-owned telephone industry. In the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, wireless telegraph communication was established between Shanghai and Chongming. In the first year of Xuantong, communication was established between Shanghai and ships at sea. In the second year of the Republic of China, Japan added a submarine line between Shanghai and Nagasaki. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Wusong Wireless Telegraph Bureau was established. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, a broadcasting radio station was established in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Development Period</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Communications established the Directorate General of Telecommunications in Shanghai. In the seventeenth year, it was merged into the Telecommunications Department, and the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau was designated as a special-class bureau. In the same year, the National Government established a wireless machine manufacturing factory in Shanghai and opened the Shanghai-Nanjing long-distance telephone service. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Communications established a telegraph machine manufacturing factory in Shanghai, which was later renamed the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory. In the eighteenth year, the Wireless Radio Management Office was established, making Shanghai the national communication center, establishing shortwave wireless radio stations in various parts of the country, and establishing an international wireless radio station for international communications. In the nineteenth year, the Ministry of Communications established the International Telecommunications Bureau and the Telecommunications Personnel Welfare Association in Shanghai. In the same year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance telephone service opened. In the twenty-fourth year, Shanghai and domestic and foreign countries tested wireless telephone communication.</p>
<p>War of Resistance Period</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, as the war of resistance moved west, many of Shanghai's telecommunications agencies retreated, merging the Telegraph Bureau, Telephone Bureau, International Radio Station, and the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Underwater Cable Telegraph Offices into the Shanghai Telegraph and Telephone Bureau Storage Office, with myself in charge of Shanghai, starting secret communication work. In the twenty-seventh year, we secretly contacted American businessmen to open three institutions in Shanghai: the American Communications Agency, the Globe Wireless Telegraph Company, and the News Wireless Telegraph Company. It was not until the outbreak of the Pacific War in the winter of the thirtieth year that they were seized by the Japanese, but a few telecommunications personnel remained in Shanghai to continue working at risk.</p>
<p>Reconstruction Period</p>
<p>In June of the thirty-fourth year, I was ordered to establish the Jiangsu Province Jiangnan District Telecommunications Restoration Office in Shanghai as preparation for victory. In August, the Beijing-Shanghai District Telecommunications Receiving Committee was established, and I was ordered to take over the Japanese and puppet telecommunications agencies in Shanghai. After the takeover, we maintained the original communication work and gradually strengthened and improved it. In November of the thirty-fourth year, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was established, and the initial sorting work was completed. After that, the Telecommunications Personnel Training Institute and the Telecommunications Machinery Repair and Parts Institute were established, all of which are branch institutions under the Telecommunications Bureau.</p>
<p>Victory to Date</p>
<p>It has been almost a year and a half since the victory. This period is a period of initial construction. Due to the simplicity of the machinery, the lack of materials, the difficulty of transportation, and the shortage of talents, we have felt restrained and difficult everywhere. The current telecommunications speed is indeed much more advanced than when we first took over, and it cannot be said that it is not the result of the efforts of the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications, the Bureau, and the telecommunications personnel of various bureaus. At present, wired telegraph, wireless telegraph, wired telephone, and wireless telephone services from Shanghai to various important cities have been opened one after another, and international wireless telephone service is also being tested. According to the recent statistics of the Bureau's business figures, the average monthly number of telegrams to and from is 448,939, an increase of about 1.6 times compared with the 26th year of the Republic. The average monthly number of long-distance telephone calls is 147,860, an increase of about 2.7 times compared with the 26th year of the Republic. In the future, the business figures will continue to rise.</p>
<p>Focus of Work - Pay Attention to Three Points</p>
<p>As for the focus of the Bureau's work in the past year and a half, we have put our efforts into the three points of "accessibility," "smoothness," and "speed" of telecommunications. We strive to make the inaccessible accessible, the accessible smooth, and the smooth fast.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to specifically present four points to report: (1) Rectify broadcasting stations. (A) Manage the order of the airwaves to avoid disrupting wireless communication. (B) Regulate material resources so that they are not concentrated in one place but can be distributed throughout. (C) Eliminate inferior radio stations to avoid affecting other radio stations. (D) Recover the sovereignty of the broadcasting industry and do not allow foreigners to be superior. At present, there are eighteen stations in this city that have been approved to participate in broadcasting. The Bureau, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Communications, together with the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, dispatched personnel to investigate and seal up the remaining unapproved radio stations. It is hoped that the broadcasting industry in Shanghai can be brought into line in a short period of time and complete the government's orders. (2) Regarding the fact that employees and errands still occasionally make illegal demands from the outside world, the Bureau, in addition to strictly prohibiting it, also pays attention to secret investigations at any time. At the same time, we ask all users in the city to give us strong assistance. Whenever the above happens, please pay attention to the symbol or appearance of the person and secretly notify the Bureau or report it to the police for arrest.</p>
<p>Facsimile Telegraph - A Combination of Emotion and Text</p>
<p>(3) I hope that citizens will save on telephone usage. (4) The newly opened facsimile telegraph between Beijing and Shanghai has three benefits: (A) It is very fast and arrives as soon as it is sent. (B) The handwriting is realistic, without fraud or other drawbacks. (C) Using facsimile telegrams for weddings, funerals, and celebrations can have the effect of both emotion and text.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to talk to you about is that telecommunications aims to serve the people and has a great relationship with society. Although our country's telecommunications industry is now moving towards the road of construction, it is still far from our ideal. I hope that social elites, transportation pioneers, and every citizen will often supervise and contribute opinions at any time to correct our mistakes and supplement our deficiencies, and use the power of the masses to promote this telecommunications industry to gradually reach a bright and great stage.</p>
<p>The Singing Voice is Sweet and the Qin Melody is Resonant - A Perfect Combination</p>
<p>Yesterday, our newspaper held its fourth special broadcast. In addition to Yu Bingjian's speech on "The Telecommunications Industry in Shanghai" and Dr. Zhong Zhihe's discussion on "A Review of Tuberculosis Problems" during the day, there were many other programs, such as the "Virgin's Heart" performed by the Postal Workers' Troupe and the harmonica solo by Shi Renwang, the host of the Popular Qin Society. In the evening, there were Kunqu Opera performances, including Miss Liu Hutu and Mr. Yin Zhenxian's "Golden Sparrow Record," and Mr. Ye Xiaohong, Mr. Zhou Mengxuan, and Mr. Yin Zhenxian's "Romance of the West Chamber." Mr. Zhou Mengxuan and Miss Liu Mietu performed "The Red Pear Record." All were accompanied on the flute by Mr. Jin Shousheng. Finally, there was Peking Opera singing, including Mr. Song Yunming's "Hanging the Golden Turtle," Miss Bao Youdie, a famous amateur of the Mei School, performed "One Hall Trial" (Wang Jinlong was broadcast by Mr. Guo Yunfeng), Mr. Ye Jingfeng and his daughter Miss Ye Jing performed "Killing the Fisherman," Mr. Yin Donghai performed "Drumming and Scolding Cao," Miss Hong Jichou performed "Assassinating Tang," Chen Zhengyan performed "Hongyang Cave," Fan Shiren and his wife performed "Wujiapo," Miss Ye Jing performed "The Golden Lock Record," and Mr. Guo Chunyang performed "Selling the Horse."

<h3>Shandong University Faculty's Final Appeal - Demands Salary Adjustment from the Central Government - Decides to Suspend Classes and Await Orders from May 5th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao 27th Dispatch] All the faculty of Shandong University had previously sent two telegrams to the central government appealing for the same treatment as the faculty of universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities. When the standard of living allowance was last adjusted, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin were all listed as first-class, while Qingdao was listed as second-class. It is heard that this time, the salaries of faculty members of national universities in Xi'an, Hangzhou, and other places have been increased, but Shandong University is still holding on to the corner. The faculty of the school deeply feel that the treatment is unfair and have decided to send another telegram to the Ministry of Education as a final appeal. If there is no satisfactory result, they have decided to go on strike collectively from May 5th. The original telegram sent by the school to the Ministry of Education is as follows: "Urgent, Zhu Junjian, Minister of Education, Nanjing: In the past, due to the continuous rise in prices and the difficulty of living in Qingdao, we have twice appealed to the National Government Executive Yuan and your department by telegraph to treat Shandong University the same as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other universities when adjusting the standard of living allowance. Last time, Shandong University was already holding on to the corner, causing those in office to feel heartbroken and those who have not yet come to hesitate. We originally planned to seek other jobs to maintain our lives, but at that time, due to the situation in eastern Shandong, the people of Qingdao were nervous, and we did not dare to affect the stability of education work due to the difficulties of our personal lives. Now that the people are at peace, prices are rising even higher, exceeding those in Beijing and Tianjin. Education personnel are not valued, but they should not be allowed to be impoverished without being accounted for. If this adjustment is not the same as those in Beijing and other schools, we can only ask for the whole body to seek a way to survive. It has been decided to suspend classes and await orders from May 5th and pack our luggage in preparation for the first stop. Has the request in the previous telegram been approved by the Central Committee? Please telegraph us to decide our actions. National Shandong University, all faculty members kowtow to you."</p>

<h3>Jiangning District Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Promoting Public Education</h3>
<p>Directors Gu and Li Attended and Delivered Speeches</p>
<p>Jiangning District Held a Joint Meeting of All District Principals and Bao Chiefs to Promote Public Education.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, principals of public and private schools and bao chiefs of Jiangning District of this city held a joint meeting at the auditorium of the Municipal Experimental Public School on Jiaozhou Road. Over ninety people attended, including District Chief Wu Zhongda of the district, Liu Yanqing representing Datong University, principals Wei Qiongying and Wu Hanyuan of various public and private primary and secondary schools, Jiang Xiulin, director of the Municipal Public School, and bao chiefs such as He Guosheng. Director Gu, Deputy Director Li, Section Chief Wang, Section Chief Sun, and Supervisor Yong of the Municipal Bureau of Education were all present to provide guidance. The meeting began with reports from Yu Qingtan, director of the promotion district, and Wei Qiongying, deputy director, who chaired the meeting. Following this, Director Gu delivered a speech, stating: Since the Municipal Council established the Literacy Movement Committee, the education community has also established the Public Education Promotion Committee. Although the names are different, the meaning is the same. Public elementary schools in this district were previously called primary schools, but now they are changed to national schools. The significance lies in that, in addition to educating children, adults must also be educated. Public schools must also educate children. For example, the Experimental Public School not only runs adult classes, but also runs nurseries and children's classes. Therefore, popularizing public education must include both children and adults and cannot be biased. Today, the local autonomous bodies and educational institutions in this district are working together to discuss the promotion of public education. The results will be promising in the future. However, it is necessary to carry out the work effectively, starting with a survey and then proceeding in stages based on statistics. Textbooks should be simple and easy to understand, the teaching time should be appropriate, and university students and intellectuals should be mobilized to participate in this work. As for factories running worker education, it is not only a welfare program for workers, but also beneficial to the factory's production efficiency. It is hoped that all bao chiefs will do their best to promote it together. Deputy Director Li then addressed the district, encouraging the district to work hard and providing instructions on the importance of education reaching the people and on teaching techniques. Section Chief Sun and Supervisor Shui also gave speeches successively. Then proposals were discussed and the following resolutions were made: (1) The district office, the Experimental Public School, the Public School, the Central National School, the National School, the YWCA, Datong University, and private primary and secondary schools will be responsible for conducting a household survey of the 51st Bao in the district and complete it within five days. (2) Please ask the factories to prepare worker schools and worker children's schools. The draft five-year plan for promoting public education in the district was also discussed. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of Xingdao's Departure from Hong Kong: A Wonderful Performance, A Slap, Defeated Vietnam, Buddha Zhaorong Scores Five Goals Alone</h3>
<p>The Vietnam team, who were competing in Hong Kong, gave an outstanding performance in the first two matches, and the fans welcomed the challenge from Xingdao with "folded hands".</p>
<p>On the 22nd, it was drizzling, but the fans' enthusiasm by the Causeway Bay was not diminished, and the stadium was still full.</p>
<p>As a result of the battle, the Tiger team won by five goals to nil. Under absolute superiority, Vietnam was defeated. At the beginning of the battle, the Vietnam team had the wind advantage and was used to playing on wet ground. However, due to inferior tactics and skills, Xingdao took three goals first, even in the headwinds in the first half. Therefore, there was no need to discuss the situation in the second half.</p>
<p>Vietnam slightly adjusted its formation, and Paisley was transferred to the forward position (returning to the center back in the second half), hoping to strengthen the front line attack, but to no avail. Moreover, the Vietnam team only had the opportunity to shoot "two feet" in the second half. The "magic leg" allocated it to Zhaorong to score the first goal, and of course, it was even worse!</p>
<p>Xingdao, unexpectedly Cheng recovered from his injury and returned to the game. Others followed the usual formation. All five goals were scored by "Buddha" Zhaorong. Each goal was shot in the penalty area, which was very crisp. The Vietnamese goalkeeper could only sigh at the ball.</p>
<p>How were the five goals scored? At the time of contact, the two sides were in a stalemate and mixed fight. After 15 minutes, Jingxiang saw that it was not the right way, and immediately switched positions with Jinhai. The "magic leg" personally supervised the battle and lured the enemy guards out. Then Xingdao had a chance. It is estimated that of the three goals scored, two were passed by the right side to Zhaorong to shoot in. In the last goal, Qiuting passed the ball to Zhaorong, and took the opportunity to shoot in one fell swoop. On the other hand, the Vietnamese side had no chance to make a formal shot.</p>
<p>In the second half, Xingdao's offensive slowed down slightly, and Jingxiang again picked the ball to Zhaorong to score the fourth goal. In the last minute, Xingdao got a penalty of five shots in the penalty area. The rosters of both sides on that day.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong-Vietnam Port Game: Hong Kong Team Loses First and Wins Later</h3>
<p>The Vietnam team lost to Junlian by three to two, winning the first battle. On the 20th, the port game was officially held. A large number of fans were attracted to the Navy stadium by Causeway Bay, and all the seats were full.</p>
<p>Before the war, because Junlian's lineup was strong, it was expected that the Vietnam team would lose. But the battle turned out to be unexpected. The Hong Kong team lost two to zero in the first half. In the second half, the Vietnam team lost two unjust goals, and the Hong Kong team was able to turn defeat into victory. To be honest, the victory was not clear.</p>
<p>According to the facts, if we talk about technology, the Hong Kong team is actually better. However, the performance was slightly substandard. The two foreign forwards were not used to using the left to attack, so although there were many offenses, they were blind. The only reason they got the final victory was a combination of skill and luck.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Vietnamese team played well in both offense and defense. It was indeed great to be able to take two goals first. The Vietnamese team used the first battle lineup. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong United Team</p>
<p>Bao Weilu (42nd Battalion), Hou Rongsheng (Xingdao), Xie Jinhong (South China), Feng Kunsheng (Xingdao), Chen Li (Joseph), Liu Songsheng (Xingdao), Cao Qiuting (Xingdao), Zou Wenzhi (South China), She Jinhe (South China)</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, after the military music played the English and French songs, referee Rogers ordered the start of the war. Within 15 minutes, the Hong Kong United Team besieged the gate, and the Vietnamese team's hinterland was in danger frequently, but they either shot high or diagonally, unable to open the record.</p>
<p>At 18 minutes, Zhang Hu was deceived by Chen Li, and Rong Sheng rushed forward to intercept him. Hu Shou immediately raised his foot. Bao Zalu was caught off guard. Although the ball was caught, it still crashed into the barrier. Hong Kong was behind by one goal first.</p>
<p>The United team counterattacked, and Jinhe's quick shot was patted out. Kunsheng passed it far away, and Xiao Weilu's header went over the post again. After a long attack, the Vietnam team got the opportunity to advance.</p>
<p>But seeing Hu Shou and Wen Bao advance side by side, the four-footed ball had already reached the Hong Kong restricted area. Hu Shou picked up the ball and shot, and Bao Weilu could not save it, and the Hong Kong team lost another one, finishing the first half at two to zero.</p>
<p>After the break, the Hong Kong United Team vowed to counterattack. In four minutes, Sha Liyun swept across the bottom line, and the ball had crossed the goal line. Luo Liaowen Yang, eager to save the ball, kicked the ball into the net, turning into a reverse. The Vietnam team was forced to become two to one.</p>
<p>After getting this opportunity, the Hong Kong team immediately occupied the offense, but there was no chance to break the goal.</p>
<p>At 32 minutes, Qiuting was seen sneaking in along the side, and a kick in the middle, Sha Liyun flew forward and slammed forward, the ball crossed into the net, and snatched a tie.</p>
<p>Seeing that the time was running out, both sides were trying to maintain a draw. Finally, the Hong Kong United Team attacked urgently, and the ball was in front of the Vietnamese team's goal. Bai Sini and goalkeeper Nguyen Quang misunderstood, and Xiao Weilu flashed in to push the ball, and the situation was decided. Three to two, the Vietnamese team lost unconvinced!</p>

<h3>Higher Education Institution Growing During Wartime: National Teachers College</h3>
<p>— Yan Keshu</p>
<p>The National Teachers College has been established for nine years. Educationalists are likely to be interested in its performance. Based on what I know, I will briefly describe it as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The Difficulty of Establishment and the Rapid Development</p>
<p>In July of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the Ministry of Education appointed Liao Shicheng, Wu Junsheng, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Jingnong, Wang Deyao as members of the preparatory committee for the National Teachers College, with Liao Shicheng as the director. After receiving the order, Mr. Liao went to Hunan to select a site for the college. After several surveys, he finally chose Lantian Town in Anhua. By the end of October of that year, the preparations were completed, and the Ministry appointed Mr. Liao as the president. At that time, a great fire broke out in Changsha, and rumors spread, shaking the entire Hunan. Mr. Liao remained calm and officially started classes on December 1st. In the following three or four years, there were several battles in Changsha and Changde. Lantian was close to the war zone, constantly threatened and shaken, and faced difficulties daily. Recruiting people was even more difficult. However, the college experienced surprisingly rapid development during that time. Here are some of the most prominent achievements: (1) Expansion of College Buildings: Initially, the college rented a residential building, Li Garden, and built a few classrooms and a small playground. Later, new buildings were added each year, totaling more than 40 buildings and over 400 mu of land. (2) Expansion of Educational Institutions: When it was first established, the college had seven departments: Chinese, English, History and Geography, Civic Education, Physics and Chemistry, Mathematics, and Education. Subsequently, various specialized courses in physical education and children's education, preparatory classes, folk education centers (with six affiliated folk schools), affiliated middle schools, primary schools for children of faculty and staff (with affiliated kindergartens), junior departments, specialized courses in music, training courses for physical education teachers, in-service training classes for central and national school teachers, physical education departments, natural history departments, and educational material centers (exchanging educational materials with Columbia University in the United States) were added each year. (3) Increase in Staff and Students: In the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], there were fewer than 20 faculty and staff members and only over 90 students. By the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the college headquarters, affiliated primary and secondary schools, and folk schools had a total of over 250 faculty and staff members and 2,600 students. In five years, the number of faculty and staff increased more than tenfold, and the number of students increased more than twentyfold.</p>
<p>(B) Resilient Evacuation and Steadfast Support</p>
<p>By the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the National Teachers College had developed into a large institution with seven departments, four specialized courses, three classes, and affiliated middle schools, children's primary schools, and folk education centers. Its scale was comparable to some of the older universities in the country. At that time, many professors in each department were well-known figures. In terms of teachers' colleges, it was unparalleled in the country. Therefore, there were discussions about adding graduate programs and recruiting university graduates to start a second department, with the aim of becoming a more complete teacher education institution. People in the education sector also had high expectations. Unexpectedly, in the summer of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], enemy troops moved south and Changsha fell. The college then organized a wartime service team to assist national troops, American pilots, and Chinese and foreign refugees. The Shaoyang Central Daily News stated that "The National Teachers College has become a stabilizing force in the area." An editorial in the Lantian Lixing Daily also stated that "Since the war, the National Teachers College is the only national university near the front lines that has stood firm and unwavering. Its determination and resilience must be seen as the embodiment of the nation's righteous spirit." As Puyang and Hengyang fell one after another, Lantian was surrounded. The Ministry of Education issued instructions, and the college had to move first to Xinhua and then to Xupu. Despite the inadequate conditions, classes resumed on November 20th of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944]. Before the faculty and students could settle down in Xupu for a year, the Battle of West Hunan broke out. Books and instruments were dispersed to Junping and Simeng, two nearby villages, but classes were never suspended.</p>
<p>(C) Relocation After the Victory of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, when education was being restored, the National Teachers College, citing reasons such as the gathering of famous teachers, a simple and pure academic atmosphere, remarkable achievements, and international cultural exchange, requested to be renamed National Central Teachers College and to be located in the capital area or a larger city, so as to expand and enrich the college and continue its legacy. The Ministry of Education firmly rejected this request. President Liao finally obeyed the Ministry's order and moved to Mount Heng. Only an old Bible college was available, with a size less than one-fifth of that of Lantian. The total amount of restoration funds was only over 300 million yuan, so the future development of the college has become very difficult.</p>
<p>(D) Reminiscing About the Past, Looking Forward to the Future</p>
<p>(I) A glimpse of the academic achievements of the college headquarters students: (1) Consistently achieved excellent results in the national academic competitions organized by the Ministry of Education. (2) In the 15th Hunan Provincial Games and the Nanyue Youth Summer Camp (attended by 27 schools from five provinces), the college ranked first in both events. (3) Responded to the youth's joining the army movement, exceeding the quota by a large margin.</p>
<p>(II) A glimpse of the service achievements of graduates and interns: (1) There are currently over 600 graduates and interns from the college serving in schools at all levels, accounting for 95% of the total. (2) The service locations cover provinces and cities such as Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Taiwan, Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Chongqing. They do not focus on fame and fortune and have been highly praised by society.</p>
<p>(III) Simple and Sincere Academic Atmosphere: (1) Diligent in studies, abiding by rules, and not distracted by external events. (2) Austere in life, enduring hardships even after repeated relocations. (3) Respecting teachers and valuing morality, sincerely and earnestly doing their best to care for teachers in times of difficulty.</p>
<p>(IV) A glimpse of the academic achievements of the affiliated middle school students: (1) The first graduating class ranked first in the Hunan Provincial Middle School Entrance Examination, tied with Xinyi Middle School. More than 80% of high school graduates were admitted to renowned national universities. (2) The military training performance and graduation examination results were commended by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>In summary, the college will surely continue to develop and become a model for higher normal education in our country. However, since moving to Mount Heng according to the order, the college has encountered the following serious difficulties: (1) Inadequate college buildings and insufficient restoration funds. (2) The social economy is becoming increasingly strained, and Nanyue is a small area with a high population density. The current cost of living is higher than in any other region of Hunan, making it extremely difficult to recruit faculty. However, based on my observations, the college has at least three strengths that can be unleashed: (1) The spirit of President Liao and the professors in upholding justice and righteousness; (2) The simple and sincere academic tradition; (3) The alumni's and students' interest and enthusiasm for the cause of education. If our education authorities can improve the college's situation and provide generous support, then with the college's deep-rooted spirit of the past, it will surely overcome all difficulties. I also hope that the college can continue to "cut through thorns and briars, and treat dangers as if they were flat ground," "wear out one's hair and wear down one's heels, thinking of this always" (words from President Liao's college anthem) to build its glorious and brilliant future!</p>

<h3>Textile and Cotton Cloth Industries Offer Opinions on Controlling the Re-export of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Should Strive to be Realistic and Reduce Troubles</p>
<p>The textile and cotton cloth industries are deeply worried about the newly promulgated control measures of the Executive Yuan. In the past three or four days, due to the customs' delayed cessation of customs declarations, those who have declared are rushing to replenish the spot goods, so the market is still full of vitality. However, according to people in the industry, this is just like a flash in the pan, which will soon be extinguished. Moreover, if the control measures are really taken as an example of transportation to the south, the procedures are cumbersome and the quantities do not match the facts, and the business will inevitably be greatly hit. The directors and supervisors of the two industry associations have held several meetings and are deeply anxious. The day before yesterday afternoon, Mr. Pan Shihao inquired about the policy of the control measures from Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, and provided the opinions of the industry. According to Mr. Liu, the Textile Control Committee did not know about this matter beforehand. Mayor Wu, in his capacity as Chairman, instructed the Business Department to properly draft a plan after receiving the order, which is still being drafted. The main points are roughly: (1) The re-export of yarn and cloth will be generally controlled. However, local yarn and local cloth are not subject to this restriction. (2) The quota for re-export to various places will be based on pre-war statistics. (3) The registration procedures for transport merchants will be formulated separately. Mr. Pan immediately represented the textile and cotton cloth industries and put forward his opinions: (1) The types of control should be reduced. For example, line ni and patterned fabrics are definitely not objects for speculation and hoarding. Moreover, these manufacturers are in trouble and need to promote their slow-moving inventory. Please exempt them from control. (2) The control base should be increased to ensure that households and small vendors are not restricted. (3) Manufacturers who have factories in this city and other places and need to circulate raw materials and finished products internally to complete the production sequence should not be subject to control. (4) Those who have already traded before the order issued by the Executive Yuan should be allowed to re-export as soon as possible. (5) The quantity of re-exports to various places can be used as a reference for pre-war statistics, but it is difficult to conform to the facts if it is used as a standard. The Textile Control Committee seems to be able to set a total quantity that can be re-exported from this city every month or every week, which will be distributed publicly by the industry association. (6) Members of the industry association should have the qualifications to undertake re-exports without the need to re-register. The future review of this matter and the application of procedures should be given the opportunity to participate in the industry-wide conference. Liu has not yet made any specific statements on this matter. It is heard that the textile and cotton cloth industry associations will submit another plan to the Textile Control Committee and the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Tianjin City Strictly Investigates Illegal Silver Shops, Thirteen Cases Cracked in One Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Tianjin Municipal Authorities announced that 13 illegal silver shops have been investigated in the past week. These shops privately deposit and lend funds, use floating capital, and engage in speculation, which has greatly affected prices. The Municipal Government will continue to ban them. In addition, the thorough investigation of the black market for gold here has been heard of recently. On the 26th, Sanyang Gold Shop was raided for illegally buying and selling gold. According to the authorities, the shop has been conducting black market transactions every day since the implementation of economic emergency measures, and the amounts are very large.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Association Notifies Members Not to Raise Prices Arbitrarily</h3>
<p>The Commercial Association of Cigarettes, Soap, Lighters, and Matches in this city notified its members yesterday: "It has been found that most of the cigarettes, soap, lighters, and matches operated by our association are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All exchange persons must not arbitrarily raise market prices or buy and sell on behalf of customers in the market, which will increase the burden on the public. This association has repeatedly issued notices to strictly prohibit this. Now that prices of all goods have risen sharply again, the government authorities are implementing economic emergency measures to strictly suppress them. It is hoped that all exchange persons will pay attention to this to avoid criticism from public opinion and sanctions from laws and regulations. This notice is hereby issued for compliance."</p>
<h3>Fuel Management Committee Permits Coal Merchants to Purchase Anthracite Coal Themselves</h3>
<p>The coal industry in this city previously requested the Fuel Management Committee to allow them to purchase coal themselves to open up sources. It is now known that the Fuel Management Committee has approved merchants to purchase and transport coal themselves to combat speculation in coal, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for implementation from now on. The measures for allowing manufacturers to purchase and transport anthracite coal themselves are excerpted as follows: (1) If factories in the supply area of this committee need to purchase anthracite coal, in addition to the Kailuan, Zhongyu, Huainan, East China mines, and the coal mines in Taiwan and the northeastern provinces, they may apply to this committee or the Nanjing office of this committee for anthracite coal produced in other regions, and transport it themselves. However, the area allowed for self-purchase and transportation should not conflict with local fuel control measures. (2) If the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that management is necessary in the area where self-purchase and transportation is allowed, it will issue a public announcement to stop the purchase and transportation (3) After a factory or coal merchant's application for self-purchase and transportation of coal is approved, the committee will issue a certificate of permission to purchase and transport anthracite coal themselves, and take it to the designated area for purchase and transportation. If it needs to be delayed to other places after it arrives in Nanjing or Shanghai, it should be reported to the committee for verification and a coal transportation certificate will be issued to allow passage. (4) Factories applying for a certificate must submit the registration certificate issued by the competent authority and the latest coal-using equipment list, product quantity list, and a certificate from the industry association to verify. (5) The quantity of coal purchased and transported by the factory each time shall not exceed the actual monthly demand of the factory, but those with a monthly demand of less than 50 tons may purchase enough for two months at a time. (6) The coal approved by the committee for self-purchase and transportation may be purchased and transported jointly by the factories. If the factories cannot purchase and transport themselves, they may state the reasons and entrust a coal merchant to transport it on their behalf, but a power of attorney must be submitted for verification when applying. (7) Coal merchants applying for self-purchase and transportation of anthracite coal are temporarily limited to 100 tons per month for each business, and each business should obtain a certificate from the association to which it belongs and submit it to the committee for issuing a certificate of permission to purchase and transport anthracite coal themselves. (8) After the coal arrives, it should be reported to the committee for verification with the coal certificate or mineral tax bill issued by the mining site in the place of origin. If the quantity exceeds the approved quantity, the excess part will be purchased by the committee according to the purchase price. (9) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Tung Oil in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>— Cao Sibin</p>
<p>The position of tung oil in southern Anhui is not as important as that of tea leaves, but because there are many mountains in southern Anhui, and the soil and climate are also suitable for planting tung trees, if the government can actively promote it, then promotion will definitely be easy, and the benefits will also be significant.</p>
<p>The tung oil producing areas in southern Anhui are mainly Ningguo and Guichi. The next are Zhizhi, Xiuning, Shexian, Qimen, Shitai, Jingxian, Jingde, Jixi, Xuancheng and other places; at the same time, there is a lot of wasteland in Langxi and Guangde areas, which can be reclaimed and replanted with tung trees.</p>
<p>In the past, tung oil in southern Anhui did not have an independent position. The products produced in Guichi area were transported to Nanjing by Gujia for domestic sales. The products produced in Xiuning and Shexian areas are of higher quality, so they are often resold to Shanghai by Hangzhou oil merchants for foreign sales. However, because of its small output, people often only know that it is tung oil produced in Zhejiang, and ignore that it is produced in southern Anhui. As for the quality of tung oil in southern Anhui, according to the purchasing results of the Trade Commission during the war, it is higher than that of neighboring provinces. The oil content is usually between 15170 and 15180 degrees. Moreover, the acid value is very low, which is indeed very suitable for foreign sales standards. The annual output is about 50,000 piculs. But the actual number, according to those familiar with the inside information, should be between 60,000 and 70,000 piculs. From this point of view, tung oil in southern Anhui really has a lot of room for development. The problem is only how to encourage the trend of planting tung trees, and the government's promotion and guidance.</p>
<p>Output Table of Tung Oil in Southern Anhui</p>
<p>Xuancheng 237 piculs</p>
<p>Ningguo 10,046 piculs</p>
<p>Xiuning 7,725 piculs</p>
<p>Shexian 5,365 piculs</p>
<p>Qimen 5,075 piculs</p>
<p>Yixian 2,340 piculs</p>
<p>Guichi 10,334 piculs</p>
<p>Zhizhi 3,426 piculs</p>
<p>Taiping 118 piculs</p>
<p>Dongliu 1,000 piculs</p>
<p>Shitai 3,240 piculs</p>
<p>Qingyang 255 piculs</p>

<h3>Denver: Exploring the Heart of the Rocky Mountain Empire and Traces of the Founding Father</h3>
<p>— Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent in the United States of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Denver, Colorado, 7th Dispatch</p>
<p>Returning to New York from Los Angeles, crossing the entire United States, Americans describe the longest journey, often using a colloquialism: "From Los Angeles to New York, railway companies are most happy to sell 'full-fare' tickets from Los Angeles to New York, and several companies are quite competitive in offering preferential treatment." A friend only spent forty-five dollars to buy a railway ticket called "Pacific Special Train," which is unprecedentedly cheap.</p>
<p>I still followed the road to Nevada and Utah. On the way back, I stayed in Nevada for five days. "The scenery of Utah is the best in the world." I only appreciated it for a while through the car window. I stayed in "Xiangyuan," the capital of Wyoming, for half a day, and then detoured from Xiangyuan to Colorado.</p>
<p>Wyoming is a desolate state, with a vast area and sparse population, a semi-desert grassland area, without farmers to develop. The population of the United States is not yet proportional to the land. The east is dense and the west is sparse. The "westward movement" of the United States has been going on for nearly a hundred years, and it is still continuing. The Population Census Bureau in Washington most recently released figures: on average, one in thirteen families in the United States is moving westward. Today, there are 1.08 million families in the United States who are on the road from east to west, most of whom are small families of veterans, and more than half of their goals are to move to California, where they can see the sun all year round!</p>
<p>Therefore, states like Wyoming will always be in a calm situation. Their society is quiet and peaceful, and prices are much lower than in the east and much lower than on the west coast. I walked slowly on the streets of Xiangyuan, breathing the clear and free air, and felt a supreme ease. Xiangyuan has a newspaper, the Wyoming Tribune, which publishes two large sheets a day, and claims to have 100,000 readers.</p>
<p>I attended the Wyoming State Senate as an observer. That day, the senators were enthusiastically discussing the "salary increase" issue for state civil servants. The proposal from the state government was to increase the average annual salary from $3,600 to $4,200. Most of the senators were in favor of it, and a bald state senator advocated reviewing the state government's budget.</p>
<p>A pastor Branford who returned from the Soviet Union, the "hero" of Wyoming, was cheered by many listeners. He gave a speech in the "Baptist Church," proving that "Soviet Russia is a beastly country without God or religion." He also reported many things he saw and heard in the Soviet Union. Nowadays, people who can enter Soviet Russia and return safely have become heroes worshiped by the American people!</p>
<p>Glorious Double Ten is Related to Denver</p>
<p>In this way, I arrived in Colorado in a hurry. The car drove straight south from Xiangyuan, which is a broad avenue leading to Colorado. After three hours of smooth travel, I walked on the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains. The morning sun shone on the majestic Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>I should carefully introduce Denver, which is translated as Danver on Chinese maps, the capital of Colorado, the capital of the "Rocky Mountain Empire," and also the place where the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen conceived his revolutionary theory. The name Denver should be translated as Denver. Americans quite dislike words like "Devil" and call him "Danver."</p>
<p>When celebrating the Double Ten National Day the year before last, the Mayor of Denver gave a speech, the gist of which was: The brilliant revolution of the Chinese Double Ten Festival is closely related to Denver, because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary theory and revolutionary ideas were formed in Denver. There was an even more bizarre passage in the mayor's speech. He said: During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was working as a "waiter" in a restaurant in Denver (Note: In American society where occupational concepts are equal, this sentence does not have any insulting meaning). One day, Dr. Sun received a telegram in the restaurant, knowing that the revolution had not only broken out, but also responded in various provinces, and it was really successful. He quickly took off his uniform, threw down the plate, ran to the road, waved his hands indiscriminately, and shouted: The Chinese Revolution is successful! "At that time, we people in Denver didn't know much about China. Many people saw Dr. Sun and were confused"!</p>
<p>Studying Revolutionary Theories in the Library</p>
<p>This is just a paragraph in the speech. The entire speech was very sympathetic and friendly to China. I spent a week in Denver, very carefully inquiring about the anecdotes of the Founding Father's revolution back then, and also specially visited Mayor Stapleton. The Mayor arranged a luncheon for me the next day. During the meeting, he said that although he was in his old age and had been Mayor for fifteen years, he was not familiar with Mr. Zhongshan back then, because according to what he knew, Mr. Zhongshan spent most of his time in Denver studying revolutionary theories in the library. Mr. Zhongshan's speeches were mostly given to Chinese overseas Chinese, and he did not have the opportunity to listen to them. I asked him about the content of his speech on the Double Ten Festival the year before last. He said he had forgotten, because the speech was written by his secretary, and he just read it once!</p>
<p>Windsor Hotel, Where the Founding Father Lived Back Then</p>
<p>Mayor Stapleton is very familiar with several old overseas Chinese: Hu Hehui, Hu Hezhen, the owners of "Guangdong Restaurant" and "Chongqing Building". Later, I also talked in detail with a young overseas Chinese leader, Mr. Huang Guoguang. Mr. Huang said that it is a fact that the Founding Father often lived in Denver, but it is absolutely impossible for him to be a waiter, because at that time, the Tongmenghui had already been established, and the Founding Father led the overall revolutionary plan, and he did not need to rely on being a waiter to maintain his life economically, and he did not have the time to engage in "side jobs". Huang Guoguang said that as far as he knew, Mr. Zhongshan often lived in a hotel called Windsor Hotel on Larimer Street at that time. At that time, Denver was still a small city, and the southern half of the city had not been developed at all. Larimer Street was in Tokyo City, which was relatively prosperous.</p>
<p>Huang Guoguang now runs a "New China" restaurant. He is diligent in his work and humble in his dealings with people. Therefore, although he opened his restaurant in the "political district" in the south of the city, his business is very prosperous.</p>
<p>Visiting the Sino-American Club on 15th Street</p>
<p>Later, I visited the "Sino-American Club" in Denver, No. 915, 15th Street, which was a product of the war. During the war, a large number of Chinese air force personnel came to Denver for training. In order to comfort these young men's loneliness in a foreign land, this club was established. An American old lady in her fifties, Fanding, is the manager of the club. She introduced me to many Chinese friends. She said that she has maintained friendly relations with the Chinese for 40 years, because the Chinese are honest and pay attention to morality. She has never been to China and cannot speak Chinese.</p>
<p>She said that Mr. Zhongshan lived in Denver for a long time, and often gave speeches about the revolution in a building at No. 2015 Market St. Once, she also listened with the overseas Chinese, but Mr. Zhongshan did not know her. She said that the building is still there now, and is managed by an old lady named Allen.</p>
<p>I wandered in front of No. 205 for a long time. The house was tightly locked. It seems that it is now the "Overseas Chinese Guild Hall". Old Mrs. Allen was not there, so I made a trip in vain.</p>
<p>Three Different Types of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Chinese in Denver are slowly forgetting the stories of the previous generation, and the younger generation is standing up vigorously. The Chinese in Denver can probably be summarized into three different types: overseas Chinese from Guangdong, engineers, and aviators. On the second floor of the Customs Building, I met Mr. Xu Huaiyun, the representative of the Resources Committee stationed in Denver. He is the chief person in charge of the design of the Yangtze River Power Plant in Denver. Xu said that the design work is being carried out in cooperation with the U.S. Reclamation Bureau. The design is entrusted by the Resources Committee to the Reclamation Bureau. Half of the designers are Chinese and American engineers.</p>
<p>I met several young engineers who worked at the Reclamation Bureau. They are energetic, have ideals, and have ambitions. The Reclamation Bureau is in charge of water conservancy and irrigation projects in seventeen states in the western United States. This is one of the most needed and truly practical agencies for the people of China today.</p>
<p>Chinese Trainee Air Force to Return to China in August After Completing Training</p>
<p>In the Sino-American Club, I met "Peter Wu," Mr. Wu Chongzhen, the translator and English teacher of the Chinese Air Force training team in the United States. He came to the United States during the war and moved around with the Air Force soldiers, because of the different types of training and the different locations. A training team often moves here today and there tomorrow. He said that there are still about XX people training near Denver now. They have learned reconnaissance, bombing, radar, aviation manufacturing, etc. Because of their good results, they are appreciated by General LOWE, the director of the training camp. According to Wu Chongzhen, the entire training period will be completed in August this year, and everyone will return to China. It is difficult to say whether anyone will be sent here in the future.</p>
<p>During the Chinese Lunar New Year, there was a grand celebration in the Denver Air Force camp, and there were also very lively scenes in the city of Denver. Unfortunately, there are too few overseas Chinese, "less and less every year," old lady Fanding said with great emotion.</p>
<p>I should quote a bit of historical story to explain the relationship between Colorado and the Chinese overseas Chinese. Colorado is the most important state in the Rocky Mountains. Before the American Civil War, it was still the world of the Red Indians. Although there were white people, they were only a minority. In the year the Civil War broke out, the far-sighted Lincoln appointed General Gilpin, the first wartime governor, to Denver in order to win the cooperation of the West. This situation is similar to that before the establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government before 1939. Although the provincial institution has not been established, it already has the prototype of a "province". General Gilpin arrived in Denver at the end of February 1861, and Colorado was officially "established as a province" on August 1, 1876. To this day, there is a bronze statue of General Gilpin in front of the State Senate of Colorado.</p>
<p>It is said that the first white man to enter Colorado was named "Russell". He came to mine gold and trekked from Kansas to Colorado, and had a bloody battle with the Red Indians. That was in 1858.</p>
<p>Large Influx of Overseas Chinese Before the Establishment of the Province</p>
<p>The arrival of overseas Chinese in Colorado was before the "establishment of the province", around 1865. The earliest "founding father" was named Chen Lingshu (transliteration). At that time, because the Civil War had ended, the United States was building a large number of railways, and Chen Lingshu was responsible for recruiting Chinese railway workers. In 1870, there were as many as 3,000 Chinese railway workers in Denver. After the railway was built, many stayed in Denver. Slowly, slowly, people "returned to China" every year. There were more people returning and fewer people coming. Now there are only 150 people left. Old lady Fanding said very emotionally that these overseas Chinese do not believe in Christianity very much, but they all have a kind heart!</p>
<p>Starting with Industry, Chinese Students Study Mining</p>
<p>The University of Denver is famous for its mining and metallurgical engineering. Many Chinese students study mining and metallurgy. Many people have graduated and are preparing to return immediately. Several are preparing to go to Northeast China to open mines. They are concerned about the safety of Northeast China. There are also about dozens of engineers from the Resources Committee who are designing the Yangtze River dam. Their design work will take another year or two. Xu Huaiyun said that the initial contract signed by the Resources Committee with the US Reclamation Bureau stipulated that China should pay a design fee of 500,000 US dollars, and 200,000 US dollars has been paid so far.</p>
<p>Colorado is a province that started with industry, especially metallurgy, water conservancy, and the electricity industry and reclamation related to water conservancy. I have a diligent and energetic impression of Denver, and it gives people a sense of vitality everywhere.</p>
<p>I visited the State Senate, the Mint, and two newspapers. The Mint is located in a sophisticated building in the south of the city. Because Colorado produces gold and silver, the currency minted every year reaches more than 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Two Newspapers: The Authority of Public Opinion in the Province</p>
<p>Denver has two newspapers: The Denver Post, the authority of public opinion in the province, publishes five editions a day, and sells about 200,000 copies a day. It is a very profitable newspaper. The founder was Pompeo, an Italian-American. Now that Pompeo is dead, some of the stock has been sold. Pompeo's daughter, Helen, is now the financial director of the newspaper. The current chairman is Campbell, and the editor-in-chief is McCain.</p>
<p>The Rocky Mountain Empire News is a Howard-affiliated newspaper, tabloid size, sells about 100,000 copies, and is hosted by Foster. The news editor is Cassel. They have telecommunications connections with the Howard Editorial Department in Washington, and editorials, etc. are all sent from Washington.</p>
<p>Understanding China is the Primary Task</p>
<p>Both newspapers had reporters interview me, and they both published my photos and news. They are interested in China, but they know too little about China. They regard Secretary of State Marshall as a "sage". They believe that throughout history, Marshall is the only one who understands China.</p>
<p>The day after I arrived in Denver, a senator from Nevada returned to Nevada from Washington, and gave a speech there, opposing lending to any foreign country, and the loan negotiations with China should be stopped. Many American friends asked for my opinion, and I had the pain of "not knowing where to start with the Twenty-Four Histories". I feel that how to make the people in the interior of the United States understand China and know China is the most important task currently standing between China and the United States!</p>
<h3>The Suppurating Sore of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Jiyi</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu 20th Quick Dispatch</p>
<p>This vast plain of Northern Jiangsu is neither a desert like Mengjiang nor a barren land like Northern Shaanxi. Its location is at the administrative and commercial heart of the nation, adjacent to Nanjing and Shanghai. Its safety directly impacts the security of Nanjing and Shanghai and indirectly affects the overall national situation! The Chinese Communists (CCP) regard it as their sole "granary" and a strategic point they must contend for in both military and political terms. Since the government began its "pacification" efforts there, the CCP initially took great precautions, fearing a strong offensive that would be difficult to resist. Therefore, in the early stages of pacification, they did reduce many targets by adopting tactics such as "streamlining troops and administration" and "breaking up into smaller units." They also temporarily abandoned some key points and lines. However, not long after, they realized, "These so-called brilliant plans are nothing but this," and gradually revived from many corners.</p>
<p>The Onset of Suppuration is Quite Severe, Threatening to Sweep Across the Entire Area</p>
<p>The officials responsible for pacification and security, after months of effort, managed to clear several major transportation lines. The people living along these lines and in the urban strongholds, as well as those who had fled from the countryside to the cities, had been enduring daily torment and sleeping in the fields every night. Now, suddenly, they were back in the embrace of the government. Their feelings of joy and excitement were, of course, indescribable. However, the officials, walking under heavily guarded conditions along the transportation lines, had few opportunities to visit the people in depth. They looked at the surface, seeing theaters, bars, radios, and neon lights weaving together a scene of great prosperity, and declared that the bandits of Northern Jiangsu had been eradicated and the great task of pacification had been completed. The government, based on these official reports and the "inspection records" produced by a few inspection personnel who only attended banquets in the cities and rode in cars on the highways, believed that Northern Jiangsu was indeed peaceful. As a result, many National Revolutionary Army troops were transferred elsewhere. With this, the CCP, relying on their detailed intelligence, was given another opportunity to regroup. Furthermore, it was the time when wheat and tall grass grew luxuriantly in the countryside, the best time for them to launch activities and counterattacks. Therefore, in the past month or so, the wound that seemed to have closed on the surface has been festering inside again. This suppuration is coming on strong, threatening to sweep across the entire body! But the "doctor" seems to have overlooked it!</p>
<p>City Intellectuals are Debating, But Rural Towns and Strongholds Cannot Be Lost</p>
<p>At present, Northern Jiangsu, from south of the old course of the Huai and Yellow Rivers to the north bank of the Yangtze River, a vital "granary" that the CCP calls the "Central Jiangsu Military Region," is almost a vacuum in terms of our military and political installations. The commanding officer of the First Pacification Zone did indeed make great efforts in this area in the past. However, military and political efforts still lacked practical coordination, and political efforts were not closely linked to the people. Those responsible for military affairs said, "Politics is more important than military affairs. Now that we have driven away the Communist bandits, you should do your job well." Those responsible for administrative affairs said, "Although the Communist bandits have temporarily retreated, their military strength has not been eliminated. As soon as the National Revolutionary Army leaves, they will return! The self-defense forces are only good for catching petty thieves. We have nothing to work with, how can we push forward!" Each had their own reasons, and none were wrong. The mistake still lies in the lack of practical coordination between military and political efforts, the failure to thoroughly implement military and political orders, and the pervasive corruption and deception from top to bottom, which are the biggest obstacles! Recently, within the territory of Nantong, where the Pacification Headquarters is located, three towns, including Yigang and Qiaotou Bridge, were lost in succession. These important strongholds were lost amidst the situation where military and political officials in the city were debating and mutually suspicious. The self-defense forces in these two places numbered over 400, all outstanding young men who had suffered greatly from the Communist army and voluntarily joined the service. Their weapons and ammunition were also purchased with their own savings and loans. They were determined not to be deceived by the Communist army again. Therefore, when attacked, they fought day and night, resolutely resisting with the unity of the military and the people. However, the result was the same: because they received no assistance, they were all killed by the Communist army with machine guns and bayonets after running out of ammunition and exhausting their supplies and shedding their last drop of blood! The self-defense forces and people in the neighboring towns felt "sympathy for their own kind" and filed complaints with the government. The government officials all consoled them in the same way, saying, "Do not believe rumors and cause unnecessary panic. The government has a perfect plan." "The officials have their reasons." The people dared not ask more and could only return and continue to live day by day in a state of unease.</p>
<p>How Much is Northern Jiangsu Worth? A Small Statistical Attempt</p>
<p>In the eyes of people living in the blessed land south of the Yangtze River, "Jiangbei" (Northern Jiangsu), the birthplace of cart drivers and coolies separated by a large river, has never been much in their minds. Because there are neither beautiful Suzhou and Hangzhou comparable to paradise nor magnificent buildings like Nanjing and Shanghai, it seems to be alright whether they are embraced by the government or temporarily suffer some devastation. The compatriots who grow up there have no smart Western suits to wear and no advanced knowledge to seek, so they have to drift to all directions like abandoned orphans, doing the work of cart drivers and coolies! However, there is a huge amount of produce there, which is indispensable to the people living in the blessed land; it also secures huge economic resources for the country. Apart from the daily necessities such as chickens, ducks, eggs, meat, as well as wheat, beans, cottonseed, corn, and strong and durable homespun cloth, most of which are obtained from Northern Jiangsu, the most important textile raw material, cotton, used to have an annual output of five million dans of cleaned cotton in Northern Jiangsu, which is enough to meet the needs of 1.7 million spindles. The highest quality American cotton also has a production of nearly one million dans in Northern Jiangsu. And the salt of Lianghuai (Huai'an and Huaiyin) has added a lot of revenue to the national treasury. If we make a statistics of these produced materials, the benefits it gives to the country and society are definitely not comparable to the superficial colorfulness in the city, which actually consumes more than it produces! The CCP sees this more clearly than we do, so no matter what, they are unwilling to give up this warehouse easily. However, why are we still so indifferent to this cow, only caring about milking it and not giving it maintenance and rest?</p>
<p>Everyone Says They are for the People, But the People are Squeezed in the Cracks</p>
<p>The suffering of the people living in Northern Jiangsu today is hard to imagine without experiencing it firsthand! Some "progressive gentlemen" who sit in high-rise buildings, loudly calling "go to the people," and waving the "flag of democracy" agree whole heartedly after reading a few dissertations by democratic doctors. If these immortals have the courage to personally run to the real people of Northern Jiangsu for a field stay (you can't see the real situation in the city and in the car), I believe their "progressive" thoughts will immediately shake and not know where to go. The people who live here are in a dilemma, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, under many styles such as "three assets," "struggle," "liquidation," and "emancipation"! If they don't escape, they will surely die, but if they do escape, they can only leave empty-handed in the dead of night, and how can they survive with a bleak future? Even if they are fortunate enough to escape into the government's rule, they are easily suspected of being spies, leaving them with nowhere to stay! The fields in the countryside are deserted, no one goes to plant them, and no one has the heart to work hard again; if they run into the city, there is no work to do! Pure and upright people are confused by the smoky atmosphere everywhere, and they can't wait to find a temple to become a monk; cunning and corrupt people are just right to make a big profit in the troubled waters! Everywhere is a pack of tigers and wolves, and the sky is not seen; but everyone is shouting the same thing, that they are for the people; and the pure and upright people are all squeezed in the cracks, suffering the pain of upper and lower torments! Under this situation, who is happy to work and produce? It is better for everyone to wait for death with their hands in their sleeves. "When will this day end!" Who should be waited for to save them?</p>
<p>Pacification Work is Like Fighting a Fire, and Embers Will Surely Reignite If Not Extinguished</p>
<p>Now, amidst a series of news such as "bandit forces in Northern Jiangsu are acting rashly" and "Communist troops in Southern Shandong are urgently seeking to flee south," the First Pacification Zone is holding an important pacification meeting. Participants in the meeting include Commander Li Mo'an, the responsible officials of the provincial government, the district security commander, the county magistrates, and the military section chiefs. We believe that the mission of this meeting is extremely important, and we hope that its resolutions will achieve greater success. However, based on our on-the-ground investigation in the countryside of Northern Jiangsu for several months, as well as our past experience of living there for a long time, we believe that it is not enough to just set out a few slogans for the suppression work. To learn from past mistakes and prevent future troubles, we must achieve the following key points:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to deploy sufficient regular military force to thoroughly suppress the bandits. Do not underestimate the enemy and place tasks that cannot be afforded on the limited strength of the self-defense forces, which will only lead to the sacrifice of the people and will not help the matter.</p>
<p>Second, the government must support the growth of self-defense forces, and be cautious in the selection of self-defense and baojia personnel. If self-reformers are given excessive preferential treatment and left unchecked, it will not only lose the people's centripetal force, but also easily cause endless troubles.</p>
<p>Third, political affairs cannot be put on the right track because the bandit scourge has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, military affairs should still be placed first. If the suppression is successful, the people will be protected, good people will voluntarily take up administrative and self-governance work, and political orders will be easily implemented without obstruction; agriculture, industry, and commerce will return to normal, local financial resources will be sufficient, and all waste can be easily eliminated.</p>
<p>Fourth, since the situation in Northern Jiangsu is still different from that in Southern Fujian, the government should not cut its feet to fit the shoe when implementing various political orders, which will only increase the suffering of the people; it should formulate regulations based on the reality of Northern Jiangsu, adapt to local conditions, and not just insist on "matters related to general cases," knowing that it is impossible and forcing it, which will only make the people suffer more! Re-examining the collection of land tax, conscription, and collection of income tax in the 35th year of the Republic of China is necessary in the Northern Jiangsu region, which is full of holes and eagerly awaiting food.</p>
<p>Fifth, the only requirement of the people is to "live and work in peace"; two years ago, the CCP carried out small favors to the people, and many people fell for their tricks! Later, they dragged out the tail of killing and arson, and everyone hated them to the bone, waiting for the government to save them, even more than hunger and thirst. In the future, all facilities must truly think for the welfare of the people, and do not disappoint the people.</p>
<p>Sixth, self-governance and self-defense personnel at all levels should be strictly trained, discipline rectified, strength strengthened, and rewards and punishments clearly defined. National education should also be emphasized to improve the people's knowledge, morality, and ability to distinguish between right and wrong.</p>
<p>We review the past pacification work in Northern Jiangsu, and we cannot say that its achievements are not great; the recovered cities and transportation lines are indeed not few; it is only because those embers hiding in the remote countryside have not been completely extinguished, and the villagers dare not go to the city to report because they have no guarantee; the intelligence of the cities is not flexible and accurate; so many corners of the countryside have been ignored, so that those embers have had the opportunity to reignite! We cherish the ancient saying "a single spark can start a prairie fire; a trickle not stopped will become a river," and we hope that this suppression work by the authorities must strive for "speed," "practicality," and "thoroughness"! Northern Jiangsu is the CCP's "granary"; if they obtain it, they can ensure their rations are sufficient; Northern Jiangsu is also the screen for Nanjing and Shanghai; if we lose it, it will be difficult for Nanjing and Shanghai to remain intact!</p>

<h3>Traces Left on West Lake</h3>
<p>— Dui Jie</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch, 18th</p>
<p>Tourists in Hangzhou can be roughly divided into two types: those who "tour the lake" and those who "burn incense." Those who tour the lake are the majority. The boatmen seize this good opportunity, and there is no doubt that they want to put the saying "three winter months rely on one spring" into practice. Not only is the boat fare expensive, but even other prices rise along with it, almost exceeding the market price by several times. This is a thorough "peeling of cucumbers." Last month, it cost only 18,000 yuan to hire a day's boat, at most 24,000 yuan. Recently, it has jumped to 40,000, 80,000, 120,000, and even inexplicably to 160,000. The purpose of touring the lake is to have fun, and a few dollars don't matter, so why haggle with the boatmen? One needs to fix a pot, and the other pot is brought in to sow. If you don't peel the cucumbers, who will?</p>
<p>Don't Peel Double-Layered Cucumbers</p>
<p>Once the interest in touring the lake has subsided, the target shifts to the nearby mountainous areas, such as Hupao (Tiger Spring), Yu Huang Shan (Jade Emperor Mountain), Liuhe Pagoda, and Lingyin Temple. At this time, it is the world of automobiles, pedicabs, and rickshaws. If you have your own car to bring with you, or borrow a car from a local friend, that is an exception. The average tourist cannot escape being peeled like a cucumber once again. If you call a car and ask how much it costs for 20 minutes, they will definitely tell you that there are no cars. If you change your tone and say, "How much does a car cost to go to such and such a place?" Then they will definitely answer you: "There are cars, but the price will be so and so." Bargaining like this ensures that there are no problems. The prices of pedicabs and rickshaws depend on the appearance of the person. If you can persist, although you are being peeled like a cucumber, you will not suffer a big loss. When you reach your destination and go up the mountain, the car cannot go up the mountain anymore. There are sedan chairs to sit on, one pass after another. This is the checkpoint for the chair bearers. They still don't let go of the opportunity to "peel cucumbers." Usually, the cost of the sedan chair includes the round trip. If a sedan chair costs 20,000 yuan, and you give them 40,000 yuan, you have been fooled, because you have been peeled like a double-layered "cucumber"!</p>
<p>Some curious tourists specialize in going to famous restaurants such as Lou Wai Lou (Restaurant Beyond the Building), Tai He Yuan (Supreme Harmony Garden), and Wang Run Xing to eat. They think that these restaurants have good food and cannot miss the opportunity to try them. In fact, they have been peeled like a "cucumber" again. Lou Wai Lou has a good name, but only the West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy is the best dish. Wang Run Xing is an old and prestigious restaurant with several branches, and only two dishes are famous: "Fish Head Tofu" and "Hometown Braised Pork." Of course, the old shop on Zhuzhi Street claims to be the real brand. Tai He Yuan is generally considered to be very expensive, but in fact the price is cheaper than Lou Wai Lou. Only the "Stir-fried Shrimp" is better among all the dishes. As for Hangzhou specialties, such as Longjing tea leaves, Zhang Xiaoquan scissors, Wang Xingji fans, and West Lake umbrellas, there is no reason behind them. The psychology of tourists is partly for souvenirs and partly for gifts, to show at least that they have been to Hangzhou. Based on the psychology of tourists, merchants are able to peel them like "cucumbers."</p>
<p>Stepping Halfway Up the Liuhe Pagoda</p>
<p>Bu Shaofu, the deputy editor-in-chief of Shen Bao and professor at Fudan University, playwright Tian Han, Wu Tian, and famous director Ying Yunwei also rushed to Hangzhou to join in the fun, which kept Chu Yusheng, the special correspondent of Shen Bao in Hangzhou, very busy. One day, they went to visit the Liuhe Pagoda together, guided by Mr. Chu and a commissioner from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Liuhe Pagoda is thirteen stories high, but they stopped at the sixth floor because there was no way to go any further. At the top of the Liuhe Pagoda, the water of the river flows, and the inspiration of these cultural figures immediately flowed out. Mr. Shaofu also told a joke: "I remember a few years ago, there were three newly married couples who specially ran to the Liuhe Pagoda to hold their weddings in order to seek good luck. As a result, of these three couples, some died and some divorced, all turning into tragedies. The reason is that they only knew "Liu He" (Six Harmonies), but forgot the last word "Ta" (Pagoda), so they had to separate." Everyone laughed a lot after hearing this. The author of "Beast Beast Beast," Wu Ming Shi, also felt the same beauty of the Liuhe Pagoda when he was drinking tea at Fanghe Pavilion. He said, "Standing on the Liuhe Pagoda and looking at the Qianjiang Bridge and the Qiantang River, its beauty is better than touring West Lake."</p>
<p>Talking About Hollywood from Hangzhou</p>
<p>One li (half a kilometer) past the Liuhe Pagoda is Zhejiang University, whose school buildings are not considered the best, but the natural environment is comparable to Tsinghua University. Secretary Wang of Zhejiang University led the tour and explained the origin of "Lingzhi Grass" and "Lovers' Bridge." The more Mr. Wang talked, the more excited he became. Finally, he suggested to our artists to make this place China's Hollywood, and Ying Zhenwei was the first to express his agreement. A reporter expressed disagreement, saying, "What's so good about Hollywood? Can't China create a better film company than Hollywood itself?" A verbal battle ended in everyone's silence.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 3rd, four units of the Hangzhou cultural groups held a tea party at the Youth Center to welcome Tian Han, Bu Shaofu, Ying Yunwei, Wu Tian, and others. Chu Yusheng gave the opening speech, and the participants were very enthusiastic, with about 200 people. They gave speeches one after another. When Mr. Bu gave the last speech, the audience still showed no signs of fatigue. The next day, a newspaper reported: "Mr. Bu Shaofu said that there is a newspaper in the United States that has maintained itself for 14 years without publishing advertisements." A middle school student admired Mr. Bu for his knowledge and experience. He only knew that there was an "afternoon newspaper" in the United States that had been sustained for six and a half years without advertising, but he did not know of one that had been sustained for 24 years." Mr. Bu smiled when he saw this newspaper and said, "This student is really too naive and cute!"</p>
<p>A precious spring outing season is about to pass, but the tourists' enthusiasm is still as strong as ever. One batch leaves, and another batch comes. Constantly coming, constantly leaving.</p>

<h3>Two Calls for Municipal Improvement</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of fires in this city has been unprecedented. Although I have heard that there are other reasons, the proliferation of temporary buildings amidst the serious housing shortage is also an important reason. I hereby submit several points of opinion as follows: (1) Please have the city government allocate suburban public land and designate it as a shanty town construction area. (2) Please have the police department strictly crack down on unauthorized construction. (3) Please have the district offices pay attention to the movement of shanty town populations. (4) Please have the Public Works Bureau stipulate the minimum conditions for shanty town construction facilities. (5) In addition to advising disaster-stricken shanty towns to move to the designated locations, they should not be allowed to rebuild on the original site. In addition, Nan Shi Cui Lane, which connects Dong Tong Li Road in the east and Dou Shi Street in the west, has a large number of residents. The lane is full of garbage and lacks street lights at night, making it dirty, dark, and unbearable. I also request the municipal authorities to pay attention to improvement. (Architect Cai Jiren)</p>
<p>Another Letter: I live on Ji'an Road (former French Concession Garre Road Meiquan Lane). Recently, someone fenced off the open space inside the lane at No. 173 and purchased rotten waste paper, piling it up like a mountain. The foul smell is overflowing. In addition to harming the health of nearby residents, this waste paper is also extremely likely to cause a fire. I noticed that fires have been frequently reported in this city recently, and I would like to use a corner of your newspaper to disclose this letter, hoping that the police station in charge will investigate and order the waste paper to be removed as soon as possible for safety.

<h3>"Democratic Interlude": Soviet Troops and "People's Representatives" in Lushun and Dalian Perform a Humorous Play</h3>
<p>— Han Ji</p>
<p>Plandian, 18th Dispatch</p>
<p>Democratic Style</p>
<p>The meeting opened on April 3rd at the Daishun Cinema (formerly Showaen) and closed on the 4th. From the 2nd, the representatives gathered at the Lushun Municipal Middle School (formerly Shao Gou Public School). For several days, they dined at the Yuanshunju Restaurant and traveled in Soviet cars. In the afternoon of the 2nd, the Soviet military hosted a banquet, followed by various entertainment programs. Finally, they screened a film about the "Zhang Zhaofeng Incident." The meeting commenced at 9:10 AM on the 3rd, with all representatives in attendance. Chen Yuntao, the deputy mayor of the puppet Dalian Municipal Government, presided, and Li Xiuchun, the director of the reception office of the puppet Dalian Municipal Government, served as the reception director. In the center of the venue, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union were hung, along with portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Stalin. Slogans were posted around the venue, mainly promoting increased production, rewarding industry, and popularizing education (emphasizing hygiene, etc.).</p>
<p>The puppet Dalian Municipal Government has been abolished. A puppet "Guandong Public Office" was established in Lushun. This office was formed by the so-called Lushun-Dalian-Jin People's Representative Assembly. The details are as follows: The initiating organization was the Lushun Soviet Military Headquarters. The puppet organizations and groups summoned included the Lushun-Dalian-Jin General Industrial Association, General Commercial Association, Joint Business and People's Association, General Cultural Association, Youth League, Student League, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, County Government, and General Religious Association (Christians, monks, and Taoists), totaling sixteen units. Three hundred and thirteen representatives participated, with the aim of reorganizing the Lushun-Dalian administrative structure, euphemistically called "popular election of personnel."</p>
<p>Reorganization of Institutions</p>
<p>Chen Yun delivered a speech, stating, "In order to reorganize the Lushun-Dalian Joint Office, representatives of various local groups are convened, using local people as the standard, to establish the highest administrative office in Lushun-Dalian," and so on. Subsequently, Chi Zixiang, the director of the puppet Lushun-Dalian Joint Office, reported on the work situation in Lushun-Dalian and the distribution plan for the 350 million yuan public debt. In the afternoon, the reorganization of the Lushun-Dalian puppet administrative structure was discussed. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. Immediately afterward, key representatives and heads of puppet organizations and groups continued to meet until 7:00 PM. That evening, the Soviet military hosted a performance of songs and dances.</p>
<p>Decision on Personnel</p>
<p>The meeting continued the following day. By a show of hands, the organization and personnel election of the Guandong Public Office were formally decided. Subsequently, the puppet secretary-general, Chen Ruiguang, gave a speech, stating, "We thank the Soviet Union for liberating Lushun-Dalian, and the people have gained freedom and democracy. This reorganization of the highest administrative institution is based on the spirit of local people's autonomy to avoid popular unrest. We are non-partisan and based on the Sino-Soviet Thirty-Year Treaty of Friendship, we must support the Soviet Union, avoid struggle, increase capital, and protect the people's lives and property," fully demonstrating the ability to deceive and flatter.</p>
<p>Soviet Military Political Speech</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM that day, a Soviet Major General Staff Officer (name unknown) represented the commander and hosted a banquet for the representatives. During the banquet, the staff officer stood up and delivered a speech (translated by Zhu Xiuchun), stating, "Lushun and Dalian are permanent garrison areas for the Soviet military. No country can interfere, and no country is allowed to station troops here. We hope the representatives convey this to the people, so that local people can govern the locality and complete local autonomy," and so on. After the speech, the puppet secretary-general, Chen Ruiguang, wrote a letter to Marshal Stalin on silk (recorded below), which was personally signed by all the representatives. On the morning of the 5th, after breakfast, the representatives were gathered for a commemorative photograph, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>The resolutions are recorded below: (1) The Representative Assembly shall elect fifteen people to form the "Guandong Public Office" to manage all local administrative matters in the Guandong region. (2) The "Guandong Public Office" shall have one chairman, two vice-chairmen, one inspector, one court president, one secretary-general, and one director for each bureau. (3) The "Guandong Public Office" shall have a secretariat and the following departments and bureaus: 1. Department of Civil Affairs, 2. Department of Finance, 3. Department of Industry, 4.

<p>Letter to Stalin</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter may as well record here the original letter from the "People's Representative Assembly" to Stalin: "To Mr. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: Today we gathered in the city of Lushun, liberated by the Soviet military, to discuss the affairs of our 1.5 million people in the Guandong region and elected our own leadership organ—the Guandong Public Office. ——The people of the Eastern region will never forget the great friendly nation—the Soviet Union—for its friendship and assistance. We deeply understand that only the Soviet Union is the best friend of the Chinese people. May Your Excellency be forever glorious!"</p>

<h3>Continued Notes on Cherishing the Remaining Spring—Fifteenth Dream in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>My previous notes on Cherishing the Remaining Spring were only a sketch; there are still many noteworthy events.</p>
<p>Gao Tuozi's given name was Naichao. He first established Keke Residence, and after suffering losses, he reduced its size to Cherishing the Remaining Spring. During the Keke Residence era, it can be further divided into two phases. First, it was located at both ends of the Jiaochang, near today's Chun Garden, and later moved to the middle section of the Jiaochang, the site of today's Yuemingxuan. At first, it was not very large, but later it was magnificent. By the time of Cherishing the Remaining Spring, it felt cramped. My great-great-grandfather once wrote a poem: "A half-roomed hut (or two taverns) can barely accommodate, except for the hunchback, it's vulgar; writing a blue curtain is too desolate, the three words 'Cherishing the Remaining Spring' are heartbreaking." It can be said that his emotions were deeply attached to it.</p>
<p>However, during the Keke Residence era, Tuo Weng left an indelible mark in the area of "miscellaneous Yangzhou snacks." In the past, Yangzhou dim sum used large bamboo steamers, but Keke Residence changed to using smaller sections. Bamboo steamers used to be lined with pine needles, but Keke Residence changed to using white cloth. Although recently, many still use pine needles, valuing their fragrance, using white cloth to line the steamers was pioneered by Tuo Weng. Not only that, but the so-called thousand-layer oil cake and jadeite shaomai (shaomai is also known as "Guipentou," see "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record." Recently, teahouses have written it as "shaomai," which is a mistake.) were also invented by him. Thousand-layer oil cake is used by Yangzhou dim sum shops everywhere to attract customers, because it is not found in other places. As for jadeite shaomai, which is vegetable shaomai, it is sweet, and compared to salty rice shaomai, it has a different flavor. Those who eat Yangzhou dim sum who only know thousand-layer oil cake but do not know jadeite shaomai will always have a regret in terms of their taste.</p>
<p>During the Keke Residence era, Tuo Weng's pastry business was extremely prosperous for a time, but by the time of Cherishing the Remaining Spring, he could no longer sell pastries. Initially, he made and sold some braised dishes and fermented soybeans, but later, probably because the capital became less and less, he could no longer sell even braised dishes and fermented soybeans, so he sold stir-fried shredded pork and braised tofu. Xian's heart was particularly pure and kind, and he was always embarrassed to refuse customers who wanted to keep an account. Later, due to financial difficulties, he would hesitate, but if the customer said, "Are you afraid I won't pay you back?" he would be even more embarrassed to refuse. As the debt increased, the cash decreased, and losses became inevitable. Some of the uninhibited literati who kept accounts at Keke Residence and Cherishing the Remaining Spring improved their circumstances later, but still did not want to pay back the debts, and no longer went to Cherishing the Remaining Spring. When Tuo Weng met these people on the street, he would always turn his head away from a distance. When someone asked him the reason, he said, "So that people won't feel embarrassed when they meet me."</p>
<p>Among the old tea drinkers at Keke Residence and Cherishing the Remaining Spring, although some only knew how to keep accounts and did not want to pay back, betraying the pure and kind-hearted owner, there was another person who inspired the owner, and that was the long-time clerk, Hu San. When the owner closed Keke Residence, everyone else planned to go their separate ways, but Hu San returned to his hometown and sold his only few acres of land to increase capital for the owner, saying, "My owner has lost capital due to his hospitality, and I can also sell my own land for the hospitable owner."</p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather said, "Except for the hunchback, it's vulgar." Tuo Weng's lack of vulgarity lies in his indifference to fame and fortune, and he can also find joy in himself, not taking his increasingly difficult situation to heart. He could pick vegetables inside the counter while murmuring, and occasionally engage in humorous banter with customers. The following is an example. His friend Wang Erqiu was good at playing chess and was also a patron of Cherishing the Remaining Spring. He lived in Thirteen Bay and called himself "Thirteen Bay Resident." Another person, surnamed Guo, lived outside the city at Niansi Bridge and was called a Niansi Bridge customer. One day, just as Wang was about to leave the door of Cherishing the Remaining Spring, Guo happened to arrive. Tuo Weng, who was behind the counter, shouted, "Wang, please stop! I have a couplet to ask you about." Wang asked about the couplet, and Tuo Weng said, "Isn't the current situation a very good couplet? 'Thirteen Bay Resident just left, Niansi Bridge Customer arrives.'" Wang and Guo could not help but clap their hands. It turned out that Tuo had made his own life interesting, and could still find fun in a difficult situation, so he was happy in it. On the sign on the counter of Cherishing the Remaining Spring were the four characters "Life is for Enjoyment," written by Ji Liangong. It seems that Tuo Weng was very able to understand the meaning of "Life is for Enjoyment."</p>
<h3>The Music I Have Heard</h3>
<p>— TC</p>
<p>——Memories of an Apprentice's Life</p>
<p>When a grand concert finishes its last note, enthusiastic encore applause and commotion erupt beneath the stage. The musician, smiling, bows repeatedly to his audience in gratitude. Finally, the thick velvet curtain slowly descends, and the audience, filled with satisfaction, disperses from the venue.</p>
<p>After the performers and audience members return home, most of their conversations revolve around the success or failure of the performance, who was there, what they were wearing, and predictions of tomorrow's reviews. As for the music that was performed, they seem not to pay much attention. What we gain from concerts is a social experience, which is also a form of art, but not necessarily an art related to music.</p>
<p>Music, in a small room, in a dark corner, in the rain, and on summer nights, has given us an indescribable feeling. Its sound has resonated with my heartstrings, nourishing my soul and allowing me to deeply understand the depths of the artist's heart. It is incomparably warm and joyful. If you have a simple and unadorned heart, you will understand my words.</p>
<p>Summer is a romantic season. When the cool summer breeze blows towards us, romantic feelings fill us with fantasies. Several friends, with light steps, walk to our good friend Ma's house on Testral Road, in the Yunshang Village—the house of Ma and his sisters. To be honest, going to his house in the morning is somewhat of a headache. Ma is practicing the violin downstairs, and perhaps a beginner is playing etudes in his room. In the next room, his sister is playing the piano, mostly rapid and difficult pieces. His younger sister is also playing the flute upstairs. That huge pile of musical sounds causes many interventions from the neighbors. Entering their house is reminiscent of a morning vegetable market. But the evening—the summer evening—my memory can never erase that kind of atmosphere. The roses in front of his house bloom all over the low fence, and the shadows of the flowers cover Miss Ma's window. Her younger siblings have all stopped their noise. Yao, in the not-so-bright light (electricity conservation was very serious in those years), is playing Chopin's Etude on the most imaginative instrument—the piano. The melody is like a girl sobbing, her long hair covering her face, telling of her love affair. The chords are as fragrant as tuberose, intoxicating the hearts of young people. We eavesdrop in front of her window, and perhaps my eyes have moistened many times. We whisper to each other, "How beautiful!" Those Etudes are too familiar to me. I have heard them dozens or hundreds of times in the music academy's exam program every semester. Friedman and Godowsky's flute recordings are repeatedly played in every living room. But I only recall her dreamlike playing, draped in light gauze.</p>
<p>Chopin, a gentle and affectionate name, belongs to young lovers. My classmate Miss Zhu is practicing her major exam program—Ballada in A major—in the school hall. Her boyfriend Chen and I lean in the piano alcove and listen. Chen explains the story of this Ballade to her, describing the captivating tale of the water nymph: "The moonlight shines charmingly on the surface. The nymphs sit by the pond, laughing and talking. When the unfaithful lover pursues them and falls into the pond, the water ripples, the flowers smile, and the moon becomes even colder." Miss Zhu's eyes glisten with tears. She asks several times, "Really?" "Is it?" Her fingers increase in strength—the strength of love, the feeling of beauty. The piano sound flows gently in my ears like ripples of water. That unfortunate couple, Miss Zhu, went to the United States this spring for further study, and Chen also went to Changzhou Conservatory of Music to pursue a teaching career. Their story disappears like smoke in the sea of life.</p>
<p>"There is no feast that doesn't end." Whenever the music ends and people disperse, it always makes people think of the impermanence of things. Music is the art of time, fleeting in an instant; but it is firmly imprinted in our minds; it lives in our hearts, just as we cherish our deceased good friends, recall past friendships, and silently shed tears. When the spring is bright and the youth are searching for spring scenery in the suburbs, I can't help but remember Miss Wei, my sister's classmate, who accompanied us on a picnic in Zhou's Garden three years ago. She was an outstanding piano student, and when she was preparing for the music academy's graduation exam program, she fell ill, suffering from lung disease due to overwork. Competitive, she endured long years on the sickbed. After half a year of recuperation, she seemed to have regained some health. Coincidentally, someone asked me to play a chamber music piece, and I chose Handel's Sonata No. 4, and also asked her to play this classical work with me. She was very happy. She had played Beethoven's Romance in G for me. We worked together very pleasantly. Although it was a casual performance, she was willing to do some more practice, because she said her fingers were a little awkward after half a year of neglect. The piece was very easy. Even during practice, we would not stop halfway. I could hear her piano sound very clearly. The classical counterpoint, two melodies rising and falling, a kind of harmonious beauty, made people intoxicated in a pleasant game, but this is not enough to describe as a story.</p>
<p>When we stopped practicing, her mother made us some good snacks. Her father and guests praised our performance. This made her even more excited. The biggest piece for her graduation exam was Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto in Bb. Although she hadn't practiced on the piano for half a year, she had reviewed it in her heart all the time. Suddenly, she put down her teacup, ran to the piano and sat down. The keys, under her agile touch, cried out a song of sorrow from the great master. Her cheeks were flushed, her breathing gradually shortened, her fingers seemed to be trembling, the music stopped on an altered chord, a faint smile floated on her tense lips, and she said, "I can still play!"</p>
<p>I have heard pianists and orchestras play this famous piece at the Lyceum Theatre. Wu Leyi played it very well. She made me feel very relieved. Dong Guangguang's name and the effect of the first three chords of this piece are very similar. Please forgive me, I may not have brought back other memories from the theater. Rubinstein is a world-renowned authority on this piece. We cannot doubt the value of these masters' performances, but it was Miss Wei's fragment of performance that shook my heart violently.</p>
<p>A few days later, our small concert was performed, and she still seemed very happy. I asked her to go on a picnic to Zhou's Garden. She said, "I can't eat anything, but it's good to walk around." That day, I took the last few photos of her. Not long after returning home, the knife was heavily back on the sickbed. Later, I never saw her again. Her tombstone may be sprouting new buds, but I don't know where she is buried. Whenever I hear this Piano Concerto in B-flat minor, I seem to see the back of her head with two braids, the side of her face with flushed cheeks, and the shy voice, singing a mournful tune; through her, I see the sorrowful face of this northern master, shedding tears of passion for the despairing fate of all mankind.</p>
<p>Friend, this is some of the music I have heard. Do you think it is too sentimental? Isn't it? (The day after Qingming, 36th year)</p>
<h3>Spring Night</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>After the cold winter,</p>
<p>The hibernating vagrants,</p>
<p>Like insects startled after torpor,</p>
<p>Appear again in the city.</p>
<p>It must be the city dweller’s uneasy dream;</p>
<p>This wreath of neon lights</p>
<p>Is full of unease and fear.</p>
<p>The city manufactures sin,</p>
<p>The graveyard of civilization——</p>
<p>How many girls who pick up rouge on the streets</p>
<p>Think of the wasteful opulence</p>
<p>Built with the bones of people,</p>
<p>And in their wine glasses,</p>
<p>Red is blood, white is tears…</p>
<p>I cannot bear it,</p>
<p>This cold spring in the human world.</p>
<p>(1947.4. In spring loneliness)</p>
<h3>Sonnet</h3>
<p>— Sikong Wuji</p>
<p>The seagull of the soul flies over the illusory peaks.</p>
<p>Zhizhi holds the songpipe, causing it to rise and fall!</p>
<p>Following the rhythm of the music, embrace the wise Veres in a gray embrace. Faith listens attentively to the delicate, round breath.</p>
<p>May your innocent footsteps enter the deep steps. Thank you to the holy eyes for pardoning the sins of the separated from the prison of death;</p>
<p>Allow me along the edge of the light green dress factory,</p>
<p>Explore the free prairie of the continuous Que Lian.</p>
<p>Ah, the song of the Filipino wanderers!</p>
<p>Is so sad!</p>
<p>What about my vague and warm dream?</p>
<p>However, it casts many frozen ripples in the shadows of the dance floor lights.</p>
<p>Resent the too short time, hide hope into the deep house of the night;</p>
<p>I pray for tomorrow’s big sun, to make you smile more brightly!</p>
<p>(April 11th, Wu Lan, Baisheng Intercourse: Written here.)</p>
<h3>Kiss</h3>
<p>— Huan Xiu</p>
<p>Why not let</p>
<p>The dewdrops on the tip of the grass</p>
<p>Merge with the earth,</p>
<p>To nourish transient life</p>
<p>And live forever in the stimulation of wind and rain?</p>
<p>Why not bring down</p>
<p>The prize of life held high,</p>
<p>And heavily strike it out,</p>
<p>To sail in the boundless ocean</p>
<p>To the shore of eternity?</p>
<p>Since “Truth” is giving,</p>
<p>And “Beauty” is not taking;</p>
<p>Let joy and pain,</p>
<p>Happiness and tears,</p>
<p>Kiss each other forever.</p>
<h3>Spring Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Li Guo</p>
<p>——Sent to Lin La</p>
<p>I stand by the village quietly listening</p>
<p>The northwest wind blows the camel bell</p>
<p>It seems someone is calling</p>
<p>Could that be your thoughts</p>
<p>I stroll in the green forest</p>
<p>Bees broadcast the fragrance of flowers</p>
<p>It sounds like someone is sighing softly</p>
<p>Could that be your melancholy</p>
<p>The morning light is reflected in the stream</p>
<p>Two small crucian carp are teasing the sun</p>
<p>A few whirlpools float on the water surface</p>
<p>Could those be your smiles</p>
<p>I wake up from a dream</p>
<p>Larks fly and sing outside the building</p>
<p>The warm wind opens my gauze window</p>
<p>Could that be your song</p>

<h3>Shakespeare the Thinker</h3>
<p>(British Information Service Special Article)</p>
<p>What is the secret of Shakespeare’s greatness? There is no single answer to this question. Some say it is the wonder and melody of his poetry; many, however, believe it is his amazing ability to create characters, because he can make these characters appear as alive in speech and action. From the actor’s point of view, Shakespeare the playwright creates characters who are most suited to the actor’s ideals, and his plays are also the most entertaining in the theater. But in the excitement and bewitching emotions of watching a play, we often overlook the great poet’s ability to “think.”</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s thoughts were not only true in his own time, but are still true now, and will always be true. He can express human virtues and sins, personality problems, and problems of entire lives in a simple sentence, and make people never forget.</p>
<p>The world all hopes to be famous, whether as a famous poet, politician, soldier, artist, or writer; but the world has also witnessed examples of famous people falling into disgrace and a lifetime of hardship. Now let us imagine being at Westminster Palace in London, standing in a small, desolate room is a great pastor, suspiciously looking at a door that has just been closed; and saying to himself:</p>
<p>"How limited is the good heart that used to support me! I have lost my prominent position from now on! How fickle is human destiny! Because of the hope of early fame, everything has been accomplished in adulthood, but once fame is achieved, an unexpected blow comes from the side, thus ending my career. In my past political career, I once went forward regardless of all dangers, now I realize that I have been too demanding of power, I have always let my arrogant heart lead, and now this arrogant heart can no longer help me. I am old and tired, surrounded by jealousy and resentment, losing self-esteem, and worldly fame and power become so empty and hateful!"</p>
<p>The above passage is undoubtedly a truth about something that mankind values very much, expressed by a great thinker. This thinker is not Wolsey, who said these words, but Shakespeare, who expressed his thoughts through his mouth. What he said was a truth three hundred years ago. These concepts not only give people a deep impression in themselves, Shakespeare also deepened their impression with poetry, eloquence, and melody.</p>
<p>No matter what topic we use to examine Shakespeare’s thoughts, even if we express it in modern language, we can discover that his thoughts contain great power and lasting truth. In modern life, we still often seem to hear the voice of Shakespeare's truth. To solve the problems of modern life, should we turn to Shakespeare's works and refer to his views on England three centuries ago?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 407</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Tsurumi immediately examined the original small envelope carefully on both sides, and was relieved to see no signs of tampering. He carefully opened the original envelope, only to find another envelope inside. This smaller envelope had only four small characters on it: "Ping'er's Hand."</p>
<p>Seeing these testing words, Tsurumi seemed hesitant again. All five people focused their eyes on the small envelope, their expressions quite tense. Tsurumi hesitated for a moment, then took a small knife from his pocket and carefully picked open the seal. He himself did not understand why he was being so fussy. Perhaps it was precisely because he was thinking of Elder Aoki and his strange mystery, which made him feel somewhat apprehensive.</p>
<p>Once the envelope was opened, Tsurumi pulled out the letter paper inside, and at first glance, he saw a thin piece of white paper, seemingly without any writing, and his face immediately changed. But when they unfolded the letter paper, everyone was stunned with surprise; it turned out that there were indeed no words on the paper, only a circle drawn with black ink in the center of the paper, about the size of a silver dollar. It was obviously drawn casually, but it was very round.</p>
<p>"What is this thing? …This weird old man!" Tsurumi was so surprised that he forgot himself and began muttering in Japanese.</p>
<p>Li Ming, Han Fangdai, and Zheng Yan, the three Special Number Two agents, were already somewhat baffled by the mysterious letter. When they heard Tsurumi muttering about "the old man," they were even more confused since they didn't know who he was referring to. Only Shou Yi, who had heard Jue Chang Lao Ren explain the so-called secret "Da Luo Ling Shu" of our country using scientific methods at Bai Ren Manor, guessed that this mysterious letter was probably some kind of telepathic trick and nothing to get excited about.</p>
<p>"I suspect the person who sent the letter, 'the old man,' is a follower of the 'Eastern Sect'?" Shou Yi asked Tsurumi casually.</p>
<p>"You're absolutely right." Tsurumi seemed to wake up from a dream, looking at Shou Yi with an expression of extreme admiration. "I heard that this Elder Aoki, Miss Nakamura's mentor, received the authentic transmission of esoteric Buddhism, which the Japanese call 'Eastern Sect.' Do you know something about it, brother?…"</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Shou Yi shook his head. "Someone at the manor might understand. I remember my late uncle, Jue Chang Lao Ren, lectured on it… On the passive side, this trick is what novels often refer to as 'a sudden impulse,' or what ordinary people experience as 'heart palpitations…restlessness,' and so on. On the active side, there's 'the mother biting her finger,' the 'swearing oaths' of rural women, and even actions like 'the old woman scolding the chicken,' which can all be counted as part of it… The 'telepathy' recently studied by the West is also part of this. It's probably nothing more than some 'heavenly eye' or 'remote hypnosis' under the guise of 'applied psychology'…"</p>
<p>"That's great!" Tsurumi's spirits lifted again. "Since the old master Jue Chang at your manor has studied it, he will surely be able to explain this secret. Please…"</p>
<p>"Alright," Shou Yi knew that Tsurumi wanted him to ask the manor about this matter, and he also had this intention. "I'll take this thing back and ask the old man to take a look."</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you," Tsurumi was somewhat incoherent. "Please… So, to get back to the point, we need to return to the issue of Miss Nakamura. We've been rambling on and on, and we still haven't asked this brother to announce the information he found…" Tsurumi looked at the representative of Han Fangdai and nodded, expressing his apologies.</p>
<h3>The Three Heroes of the Dusty Road</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuguang</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Musings While Docked</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>A child, the moment it is born, cries with its entire life; it seems to be lodging a protest against this difficult and painful world.</p>
<p>An old man, when he has completed his life's ideals and is turning back to bid farewell to that beautiful history, often emits a heartfelt smile. That smile is so innocent and so peaceful and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Both this crying and this smiling fill me with longing. However, I love the latter's smile even more than the former's. I say:</p>
<p>"The first cry of mankind is not as close to beauty and poetry as the last smile."</p>
<p>In a certain sense, three people living together can be more lonely than two people living together.</p>
<p>I fear loneliness, but I fear even more throwing myself into philistine banquets. My aversion to noise is like that of an ancient criminal seeing a pillory.</p>
<p>Inexplicable is the inclination to drink poison to quench one's thirst. When "I have esteemed guests, playing the zither and blowing the pipes," although I do not have Meng Chang's ambition to "sing a generous and sorrowful song," even greater loneliness permeates with depression, and ultimately I cannot finish the feast.</p>
<p>"Officials fill the capital, yet this man alone is haggard." These are lines of poetry that I have deeply loved since I was a child. I think it is precisely because the capital has countless officials that the haggardness of this man is particularly precious.</p>
<p>I often secretly wish for the health of many friends. But when I find that a friend has become thin, I feel particularly close to him.</p>
<h3>Digressions</h3>
<p>— Huai Bao</p>
<p>In the past few days, trains have been derailing one after another, making travelers panic and almost afraid to go out. Derailments are not unprecedented, but coming after the previous plane crash, the fact that trains are derailing one after another is unsettling.</p>
<p>The reasons for derailments, like the causes of fires, can be enumerated at length; however, the most obvious reason is always the long-term disrepair of the rails, with the underlying sleepers rotten and unable to bear the weight of the train, with the possibility of collapse at any moment. Since the War of Resistance, these railways have not been properly maintained, and by now, the sleepers are naturally rotting and the screws are rusting. Any road must be constantly maintained to remain in good condition. Now, if you stop for ten years, how can there not be problems?</p>
<p>This responsibility, of course, does not lie with the railway authorities, because during the occupied period, their reach was limited, and it was something that could not be helped. However, after the victory and restoration, the authorities must actively take responsibility. Adjusting the vehicles, increasing the number of trips, and reducing passenger crowding are certainly extremely important, but the safety and reliability of the journey seem to be even more important. In the past, many people switched to trains because flying was dangerous; but if trains are now as prone to accidents as airplanes, it gives people the feeling that "there is nowhere to go." If one absolutely has to travel, I am afraid that one can only take a step back from trains and take inland river steamboats (who knows what they will be like at that time?) or simply sit in a rickshaw or even walk.</p>
<p>People are trying to apply atomic energy to civil industry, but we are risking driving on rotten sleepers. The fact that people want to use primitive means of transportation is not a question of temporary backwardness versus progress, but of whether or not one is willing to constantly seek progress. Railways were originally a new thing, but in this era of continuous innovation, they are no longer at the forefront. However, it is still constantly innovating. Comparing this situation with the millions of rotten sleepers lying under our rails is truly worrying. How can these tattered pieces of iron be regarded as antiques, let alone national treasures?</p>
<p>Movie Talk</p>
<h3>"Influence Peddling"</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>In today's world of rampant corruption, how many people in our society are relying on their relationships with women to make connections with powerful people, cultivate relationships, and use nepotism to plead for favors and go through back channels in order to achieve their goals of promotion and wealth. In "Influence Peddling," the general manager Deng, who is both an official and a businessman, is a formidable and invincible figure. Many people flatter and bow to him, but he also has to pay homage to his superior's wife. He sends Secretary Ma to accompany them in playing cards, and has already stipulated that they are only allowed to lose and not to win, and even the more they lose, the better. This is such a cynical satire on reality by the playwright! In addition, relying solely on his wife's words, he appoints his own brother-in-law to a key position that only an expert could handle. Later, his wife changes her mind in order to protect her unmentionable secret, and General Manager Deng has no choice but to reassign that aquaculture expert to Nanping Island. This is precisely a portrait of those who consider themselves members of the upper class. In this society where influence peddling is rampant, everything is as unreasonable as in this story. Now the author ruthlessly exposes them to the audience, using satire to lash out at this group of corrupt figures.</p>
<p>This is a play with rich and realistic content, but we were somewhat disappointed with the performance. If memory serves, "Influence Peddling" was once performed on stage by the Shanghai Drama Society. Compared to the stage version of "Influence Peddling," which had a brilliant record, the film version is far inferior. In particular, the ending of the film, where Chen Jiannan accepts General Manager Deng's assignment to Nanping Island, is a highly inappropriate adaptation.</p>
<p>The reason why audiences who have seen the stage play are dissatisfied with the film performance is the way director Li Pingqing handled the comedy "Influence Peddling." He did not appropriately grasp the genre, tone, or rhythm of the play. He only gave a perfunctory account of the development of the plot, without in-depth portrayals of these characters and events. When the story progresses to near the end, it should be rapid and headlong, like wind sweeping away fallen leaves, but he arranges it so slowly, filling the progress of the play with some unnecessary details, resulting in a loose and weak performance. This is regrettable.</p>
<p>Shu Jiwen, who had a brilliant career on the stage in the Great Rear Area, did not bring any special achievements here. Her portrayal of the general manager's wife lacked the necessary style and aura. Zhou Boxun's General Manager Deng was excellent, and his creation of the character's personality and physical appearance was quite successful. Feng Zhe's Chen Jiannan performed just right. Ding Ran's Secretary Ma had a slightly too theatrical feel, and Yang Wei's Chen Baiqi was one of the best among the female roles, lively, subtle, and natural.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales From a Studio</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Seeing the film advertisements and reviews in the Shanghai newspapers, with the title of the four great writers, including Wells, to attract audiences to "New Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," it seems that it is not selling well. With the help of Western material civilization, such films, I think, can be regarded as a tool for creating psychiatric patients. It is said that dozens of British and American scientists are still studying the existence of the soul; their literary circles are also selling monster stories and detective novels, but people with neurasthenia are not suitable for such "education."</p>
<p>In China, there is no need for "New Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" to help, and the bizarre and strange situations in society are more than enough to make the common people suffer from mental illness. The other day, a Shanghai newspaper published a message entitled "Crazy Prices? Or Crazy People?" The article said that a citizen of Shijiazhuang went shopping, and because the asking price was too high, it stimulated his nerves, and he fainted on the road. This story is probably not a product of writers who are divorced from reality, and there are many similar stories. Not long ago, the newspaper reported that an old woman who had not been shopping for a long time went to buy a pound of pork, but she only had a few ten-yuan bills with her.</p>
<p>All works of art are products of reflecting reality. The reason why "New Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is not popular may be that the "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio atmosphere" of Chinese reality has far surpassed the movie stories, right?</p>
<h3>Listening to Air Music—Expectations for the Chinese Harmonica Society</h3>
<p>— Yang Pingzhang</p>
<p>On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese Harmonica Society held a grand air harmonica concert at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station. All the pieces played were world-famous pieces, such as "Serenade," "Spanish Waltz," and "Double Eagle March." Also, the society's president, Mr. Wang Qinglong's "National Glory Trilogy" was also on the program. All of this performance can be said to be an unprecedented event in the harmonica world.</p>
<p>The program included solo performances by Wang Qinglong and Wang Qingrui, duets, and large ensembles by the society's symphony orchestra and accordion band. The famous accordionist Mr. Kade Baotuer also played several famous pieces. When that kind of energetic and nostalgic movement stirred up a melodious melody in the quiet air, it made people feel infinitely excited; the inner heart showed excitement and cheers with the changes in the tune. Especially Mr. Wang Qinglong's solo performance was really extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>Regarding musical technicalities, the author is an amateur, so I dare not criticize randomly. However, in today's music scene, it is gratifying to see such achievements being expressed.</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai is full of decadent sounds; therefore, people's mouths are also full of those intoxicating popular songs. When we turn on the radio, almost all of the music programs are occupied by popular songs, and it is rare to hear world-famous pieces and symphonies. I hope that the Chinese Harmonica Society can hold air concerts often in the future, so that countless people can temporarily put aside the busy and noisy world after work and quietly share a little spiritual food.</p>
<p>And I hope that the Chinese Harmonica Society will continue to work hard and shine brightly for China's music scene.</p>
<h3>Climbing Incense Burner Peak, Exploring Yu's Cave—Travels in Shaoxing, Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Mei Sheng</p>
<p>By chance, a few friends and I went to Shaoxing. The next morning, we boarded a small boat and rowed to the Yu Wang Temple, about seven or eight miles from the city. From afar, we saw the towering temple standing among the mountains, very much like the Jingci Temple of West Lake towering at the foot of Nanping Mountain. Inside, the painted rafters and carved beams, and the grand structure still exist, but all kinds of offerings, except for the solitary statue of King Yu in the center, are all empty. After several wars, it is no wonder.</p>
<p>To the left of the temple is the "Empty Stone Pavilion." A stone block measuring one zhang stands in the center, with a hole in the top. According to the stele inscription, ancient monarchs often pressed a large stone on their coffins. It was probably discovered in this way that the location of Yu's Mausoleum was first measured. A lifetime of worry, a thousand years of temple worship, and great achievements will naturally be immortal.</p>
<p>Leaving Yu's Mausoleum and heading towards Incense Burner Peak, at the beginning of the mountain, the road is paved with large stones, winding upwards, and gradually becomes higher, but it is not strenuous. After passing Toutian Temple, we climb straight up the steps behind the temple. The peak is steep and the road is narrow, and we already feel tired. Afterwards, the climb becomes steeper, and looking up, it is still impossible to climb. We walk and walk again, rest and rest again, and when we climb to Zhongtian Temple, we are already panting unbearably. Mountain children carry bamboo canes for sale, which is exactly what we need. The price is only one hundred yuan, which makes us feel happy. It can be seen that the mountain residents are honest and simple, and there is absolutely no speculative extortion.</p>
<p>Having a bamboo cane is like having an extra leg. We support ourselves and climb again. Because the mountain is high and the walls are steep, iron railings are built along the road to prevent accidents. After climbing three or four hundred steps more, we finally reach the top of Incense Burner Peak.</p>
<p>In front of the Bodhisattva statue, the incense is burning vigorously. After eating and resting a little, we leisurely look around from the top of the peak. The mountains are all lying at our feet, and white clouds are spitting out from under our feet. The surrounding pine wind and the sound of ten thousand valleys are roaring and rustling, and we want to rise up and leave. Looking into the distance, the cities and rivers are like insects, sand, and mustard seeds. The openness and depth are something that those who have been confined to the mortal world for a long time cannot even dream of. Even we, who often climb the north and south peaks of the bright West Lake, have the feeling of "once you have seen the clouds of Wushan, no other clouds are worth a glance." The magnificence and beauty are truly worthy of being the second peak of Tianzhu.</p>
<p>Although going down the mountain is easier than going up the mountain, the stone steps are slippery and dangerous. If you are not careful, you may fall. Falling down is a cliff of ten thousand zhang, and you will immediately become pulverized powder. The vicissitudes of life and going up and down the mountain can be a wonderful reference.</p>

<h3>The Capital's "Appendix"</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Anyone who has never been to the capital city cannot help but have some longing for the Confucius Temple. Because it is a "place of scenic beauty" from the "Six Dynasties powder and gold" period.</p>
<p>However, when you actually get to the Confucius Temple, if you don’t have a lot of money, your sightseeing will be in vain. In the current situation of bright lights and bustling noise, it is impossible for you to calm down and reflect on the past. The Qinhuai River and Taoye Ferry written by the predecessors are far away. A stagnant pool of water tells you that this place has already rotted and stinks.</p>
<p>Let's just talk about the temple: it is quite lively during the day, with a dark crowd of people coming in and out, naturally all to explore the scenery and sightsee. Inside the temple, there are many stalls, including food stalls, department store stalls, all kinds of stalls. If a newcomer to the capital city cannot find a way to buy furniture, this can solve this problem. In addition, a piece of open space has become the world of street performers, but they are all very cheap. At night, the activities in the temple stop, and the outside of the temple becomes a paradise for adventurers. Prostitutes, singers, guides, and meat markets are all available. From dusk, the doors of those wine and teahouses, such as Liuhua Spring and Jin Valley, are crowded with vehicles. The streamlines and jeeps form a line, implying that their owners are enjoying themselves at the table. Pimps and madams stand on the street, humming like bees. A single pedestrian, especially someone visiting the temple for the first time, may be startled by a sudden sound in their ear. There are big drums and rehearsals in the teahouses. After the gentlemen are drunk and full, that place becomes their only supper spot. The tea fee is over five thousand yuan a cup, and the place is always packed. I dare not say whether they go for real entertainment, but there are many who are there for other reasons besides tea. It is too unromantic to prohibit the Eight Masters from entering the teahouse, but the high-ranking officials can change into a set of dark blue uniforms and enjoy themselves freely without restraint. Therefore, some people say that the Confucius Temple is the capital's appendix, which does not seem unreasonable.</p>
<h3>Arts and Literary Circles</h3>
<p>Mao Dun and his wife boarded the Soviet ship Smolny on the 25th of this month to return to China. At 4 pm that afternoon, the cultural figures who greeted them at the Jianghai Customs Wharf included Guo Moruo, Ye Shengtao, Kong Lingjing, Ge Baoquan, Xu Tiaofu, Qi Shimei, Chen Baiyi, Yang Yisheng, Fan Quan, Fu Binran, Ye Yiqun, Luo Jia, and the Russian Rogov and others. After Mao Dun landed, he shook hands with everyone one by one, and when he shook hands with Guo Moruo, he gave him a warm embrace.</p>

<p>There is a Peking Opera house in Chengdu that is performing "The Biography of Jigong." Several troupes are also competing to perform mechanical scenery plays, but none of them are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Zhou Yushan's calligraphy exhibition is scheduled to be held from April 28 to May 3 at the painting hall on the second floor of the Daxin Company.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong, good boy, listen to Mom! Leave it behind!" Lan wanted to use reason to persuade Rong'er. "How much does your sister like you? Uncle Zhu taught her to sit in a good car, but she was reluctant and let you sit, let you go to Chongqing first. Why are you still unwilling to let her play with Rabbit Daddy for a day?… Soon, maybe tomorrow or the day after, we will be leaving too, and I can still return it to you on the road…."</p>
<p>But it is still a little too early to reason with a five-year-old child.</p>
<p>"No! No! Rabbit Daddy was bought for Xiao Rong by Grandma!" He insisted on not letting go, and he also had his reasons.</p>
<p>"Isn't it the same if you give it to your sister? She won't lose it for you!" Lan still wanted to persuade him, her tone becoming a little harder.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong pouted his little mouth, hugged his beloved object tightly with both hands, stared his eyes, and still did not give in.</p>
<p>"I won't! I want to take it with me!"</p>
<p>"Go! Go! Go!" Lan became angry and did not say anything more. She picked up a small handkerchief bag and walked out of the house first.</p>
<p>Rong'er did not have time to chase after her, afraid that his mother would leave and his sister would snatch it from him; but Fei Fei did not move at all, standing blankly at the door, feeling an unspeakable sense of disappointment in her heart.</p>
<p>"Fei Fei! Eat candy!" Old Zhu, with the psychology of sympathizing with the weak, immediately took out three or four candies from his pocket and stuffed them into Fei Fei's little hands, and gently said on the side, "This is better than what I gave Xiao Rong just now!"(46)</p>
