<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕綏靖區視察團，定二月一日分華北·蘇北兩組出發，由白崇禧，谷正綱等領隊出發，華北組前往冀·魯·豫一帶，蘇北組則爲淮陰·徐州一帶。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕內政部積極推進綏靖區行政工作，根據「綏靖區施政網領」陸續擬訂「綏靖區各縣行政實施辦法」，「加强中共侵佔區周圍各縣行政實施辦法」，「各縣市辦理戶口查記要點」，「收復區各省市嚴密保甲要點」及「綏靖區各級部隊長協助推行地方自治辦法」等法規，頒佈施行，以便迅速恢復綏靖區各級行政機構，健全蕊層組織，辦理各項復員工作，數月來，其辦理情形的略言之，計：（一）督促準備復員工作，該部屢電綏靖區各省府從速辦理，並</p>
<p>政人員隨軍前進，一俟縣　收復，即恢復各級行政機構，執行各項復員工作。（二）計劃縣市復員經費，經核准收復區保甲自衛組織所需經費，在所發收復區各縣市復原經費內開支（三）網羅邊疆人才，參加行政工作，以便促進民族感情，加强行政效能。（四）督促收復區各省市元成戶口淸查，於每一收復區縣市政府成立或遷回時，首先實施戶口淸查，三個月內完成，現已辦理者，有閩·桂·贛·台灣·浙·京·滬·平·津·青島等十省市，除東北外，其餘省份亦大多在完成中。（五）督促收復區各省嚴密保甲組織，據各收復區之報吿，大多數縣市均已照該部所頒辦法切實辦理，保甲組織與人員，均較前健全。（六）健全綏靖區各級行政機構，已定五原則，交切實辦理：一，簡化機構，提高行政效率，减少無關政令。二，充實縣級經費，不敷者呈請中央專款撥補，嚴禁攤派。三，遴派富有經騐年富力强之精幹同志，祖任縣長及佐治人員。四，提高縣以下各級行政人員之待遇。五，嚴懲貪污瀆職人員，並獎勵人民訴冤告密。（七），組織並健全縣市級民意機關，規定收復縣市，應於收復後立即成立鄕保民意機關，及縣市臨時參議會，六個月內成立，正式縣市參議會，大多均已先後成立。（八），加强治安力量，成立省警務處，加强警察力量，規劃警察大隊改制，審核各省市縣民衆自衛隊組織。（九），督導工程復員，該部一年來督促各省成立公共工程隊，巡廻協助各城鎭，辦理緊急實施及恢復工作，並促令各縣市先行規定營建計劃，然後依照逐步實施，一面並由該部指派高級技術人員，率領外籍專家，分赴各大都市實施考察，並協助設計，現除少數地方因情形特殊未能實施外，大都在積極辦理，（十），加緊禁烟工作，派員督導禁政，嚴飭登記施戒，厲行查緝及加強禁政考核，但檢討收復區各縣市之行政工作之困難仍多，有未能達到預定計劃者，其中主要原因，在於地方政府未能規定中心工作，分別緩急施行，經費之短絀，地方軍事機關之連繫不够，各方各級行政機構層級過多，及基層工作人員為數眾多，考核不易等。</p>

<h3>政府希望及早改組　下月中可能成事實　雷震今日與各黨人員會晤</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十七日電〕改組政府問題，日來仍在醞釀中。據聞原則上各黨派所希望者，爲全面改組，即政院，立院，醫院，與國府同時改組。青年黨對人事上分配，曾作硬性要求，希望在各部門中得佔三分之一額，自中央政府以至地方政府均如此。民社黨則尙無具體表示。又聞各黨派對屬於技術之部門，無意參加。目前政府尙係就原則方面攷慮，細則方面尙未及討　，惟政府有希望早日實行改組之誠意，故最近將積極努力。廿七日晚記者訪問洪蘭友，據稱　在三月十五日前，政府改組諸事或將有所成就。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨夜記者訪雷震秘書長，詢問對於大局之看法。承答稱：解決當前問題，首重和談，惟自政府提出方案後，中共迄無正式反響。政府現只能將恢復和談暫時　置，惟在此時期內，不擬採取其他行動。詢以　恢復和談，民盟是否可作適當之媒介？據答：民盟對此並無表示；以政府而論，對於此種努力，一貫的並未拒絕。本人此次來滬，全爲給老友拜年，並無任何活動，但亦可能與民盟人士接觸。論及各黨派改組政府之先決要求，謂改組政府應先自中央開始，地方範圍太廣，當逐步進行。至於改組政府，政府方面之人選問題，需各黨派與主席洽商。雷氏昨訪晤民社黨萬仞千，今日預定訪靑年黨及民盟人員。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕靑年黨秘書長陳啓天氏昨語記者稱：靑年黨參加政府問題，迄今猶在愼重考處中，外傳政府允予青年黨若干部，青年黨則提出更多之要求云云，此說純屬無稽之談。青年黨之希望，在參加政府後，對黨政之實施確有裨益，故目前正對政府改組後之政策，制度陣容諸問題縝密研究，在政府改組前，靑年黨不但須與政府對前述諸問題獲得諒解，並須與其他參加政府之黨派求得諒解，因此改組政府並非一蹴可就。目前接洽，尙係初步磋商，陳氏復稱：渠與李璜，左舜生兩氏，與當震氏的定在今（廿八）晨晤談。</p>
<h3>陸定一正式聲明　中共堅持兩條件</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電2中共宣傳部長陸定一，廿五日針對彭學沛部長廿日之聲明、發表長篇正式聲明，仍堅持取消國大憲法，與恢復去年一月十三日軍事位置兩條件，並認此乃「最寬大」「最低度」之條件，如不能够實現，則一政府派員赴延安，以至舉行圓桌會議」，並無必要。並稱：政府旣拒絕共產黨所提兩條件，則一切後果，當由政府負之。陸氏曾解釋此兩條之「寬大」時稱：共產黨本應要求政府「懲治好戰份子」，及「破壞政協反動份子」，與簽訂中美商的負責人，並賠償人民因內戰而遭受之損失；然共產黨均將此等要求拋開，僅提取消憲法及恢復去年一月十三日軍事位置，可謂「寬大」云云。全文長兩千餘</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕陸定一發表拒絕和談聲明後，觀察家咸認其堅　兩項先決條件之原因，意在拖延時間，等待三月間莫斯科會議之形勢變化。蘇聯態度如何，吾人固莫能測定，但我政府已循序成為民主的政府，各國必能功我進人和平民主之境，共產黨目前之觀望，或反已註定其必致失敗也。</p>
<h3>民社黨時局主張　短期內即可發表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨將於短期內發表對於時局之主張，對於政治軍事經濟外交各項現實問題，將提供各項具體辦法，作爲對於政府邀請該黨參與之間接答覆。民社黨大部份常委，僉認爲此時參加政府，與大局無補，均主張採取保留態度。若政府代表再邀請時，該黨大致將提出兩項先決要求：（一）請政府宣布政治，經濟，軍事之新政策，特別側重於保障自由及安定民主方面；（二）請政府提出改組政府後之政府人員名單，以便研究其是否能與新政策相配合。在此兩點順利解決之後，方能考慮參加政府。至於外傳參加政府將採個別志願方式者，據民社黨某要員對記者表示：如有此舉，則參與者完全以個人身份參加，與黨無關，並請其公開聲明此點。</p>
<h3>京和平日報著論　斥民盟政治報告</h3>
<p>指與共黨勾結禍國</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕南京和平日報，廿七日社論，對民盟二中全會政治報吿，加以批判，其結論爲：民盟發表的長篇「政治報」，歸納起來，只有兩句話：「共產黨有百是而無一非，國民黨有百非而無一是」。該文明白指出：民盟長篇報吿爲與共產黨狼狽勾結，助長內亂，禍國殃民的供詞，並例舉若干事實爲證。共產黨阻止國軍赴東北接受主權，民盟也反對政府接受主權；共產黨在東北以不可吿人的手段，製造一支所謂「民主聯軍」，佔領了許多城市，民盟便力勘政府「承認現實」；共產黨希望使東北問題複雜化，變成國際問題，民盟便把東北問題看成「國際題的一個焦點」共產黨對國大拒絕絕參加，對憲法拒絕接受，民盟也對國大拒絕參加，也對憲法拒絕接受。</p>
<h3>保定大雪六日　造成稀有奇寒</h3>

<h3>有關行憲法規　初步草案完成</h3>
<p>王寵惠　業各方意見</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕有關行憲之各項法規，如選舉法等，由王寵惠負責草擬，洪蘭友等會同辦理。頃悉其初步草案已大體完成，惟各重要原則。尙須徵詢各方意見，王於廿七日下午三時就國防最高委會召集會議，交換意見，計出席張厲生·谷正綱。陳立夫·洪闌友·柳克述。呂曉道等，就各要點廣泛討論，未作具體決定，擬下月初再行集會，研究後即送立院審議。頃據洪談：各國選舉法有基於黨派分配者，有應用保證金者，有應用資歷者，但在我國均不能隨意選擇，吾人盼能擬有一最進步之新法，然又不能不爲現實設想，故在起草之階段，顯此失彼，良非易易。惟應事實之需要，各項法規之起草工作，將儘速完成，俾能於預期時間內公布。</p>

<h3>台省公署嚴禁偷運食米輸日</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿七日電〕台省公署頃令警務及航業機關，與各縣市政府，嚴禁奸商偸運食米前往日本，目前台灣與日本，雖未恢復通商，然聞常有若干唯利是圖之商民，偷運食米及白糖赴日。台島四週環海，大小港口極多，三五十噸之漁船出入港口，極易逃脫海關及其他機關緝私人員之耳目，過去日本所需之糖及米，均大部仰給於台灣，目前日本米糖均缺，偸運者獲利極大，然台省米價，現亦暴漲，該署下令嚴禁私運出口，旨在保留食米，平抑糧價。該署今同時復令自一月至三月期內，禁止利用主要雜糧之一，即甘薯粉，俾免影響物價。</p>
<h3>聯總鐵路器材　源源經港運華　原為伊朗通蘇聯軍用鐵路　經聯總拆卸後培與粵漢路</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕戰時由伊朗通蘇聯之軍用鐵路，業經聯總拆卸運來中國。大此鐵路器材，包括車頭，鐵軌，車廂，貨車，已源源運抵香港，由行總配與粵漢鐵路使用，以恢復該路之戰前效率。假定所有運來之鐵路車輛，排成單行，可成八英里長之行列。大批器材正由行總在香港加以重新裝配，現已裝備完畢者計有二十噸至五十噸之貨車一千二百部，機車十入部。已配交粵漢路行駛之貨車，現達數百部，如全部行駛，其載重總量可達四萬噸。</p>
<p>該批車輛及器材，雖在戰時已經用過，但大部仍能保持良好狀態，無碍使用。九龍之裝備廠現忙碌異常，惟因工具缺乏，若干工作不得不直接應用人工，但仍能每日裝成六七部。據行總某專家談：一戰後全世界均缺乏鐵路車輛及器材，若非拆卸伊朗鐵路直接供我使用，吾人縱向英美訂購，須俟兩年後方能交貨，現已運來之伊朗鐵路器材，除大批車輛外，尙有鋼軌四萬五千條，枕木廿五萬根，實爲難得」云。</p>

<h3>聯總駐華機構　定三月底結束</h3>
<p>行總工作將予延長</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總當局以聯絡中國方面之機構將於三月底結束，但聯總物資尙有百分之五十須繼續運華，故行總工作仍將延長，屆時恐不能結束。惟對於該署業務方面，正計劃部分移交，同時並積極從速分配救濟物資。移交工作，將按照有系統之計劃逐步進行。目前業經移交之器材，有行總水運大隊之船隻若干艘，乃交於中國輪船業濟運聯營處者，此外船隻駕駛，機械，管理等技衛人員，亦同時由該處雇用，但有一部分外籍人員之待遇問題，尙未全部解決。聞因外籍人員要求該處按聯總待遇發給，而聯營處當局目前尙不能同意。</p>

<h3>周佛海逃死無路　其妻聲請再審已遭駁回</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕周逆佛海覆判維持原判死刑後，其妻楊淑慧，日前已具呈首都高院，請求再審，其再審書狀，當經趙琛院長發交刑二庭辦理。該庭庭長鄭禮鍔及推事王鴻全，劉賢才，數次審核後，於廿七日午後會議決定，以卅六年再字第二號特種刑事裁定駁回。裁定書主文：「再審之聲請駁回」。</p>
<p>微功難蓋巨過　小惠莫蔽大辜</p>
<p>其理由首述楊氏乃依刑訴法第二十八條第二項之規定，以彭壽，程克祥於審判時未出庭作證，及依處理漢奸條例第三條，於「自首」後所作「有利抗戰」之行為，應請重審減刑云云，「然查被告周佛海通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，於二十八年十一月四日，已經最高法院檢察署明令通緝有案，該被吿所稱「自首」，事在卅一年冬間，無論軍統局獲函吾認其事，即令屬實，旣在已發覺且經明令通緝之後，即不合於自首條件，何能以此為聲請再審之理由。再查處理漢奸條例第三條，雖有漢奸曾爲協助抗戰工作，或有利於人民之行爲，證據確鑿者，得减輕其刑之規定，但此次規定係採「得減」主義，並非「必减」，縱合於該條所定之條件，減輕與否，審判宣仍有按其犯罪情節之輕重，予以裁定之權。」繼縷述周逆犯罪行爲：「綜其罪行極爲重大」。再就其「小功」而言，『微功難盡巨過，小惠莫蔽大辜，裁量情節，懼衡輕重，旣認爲難依處理漢奸條例第三條予以「得减」，非處極刑不足以昭烱戒，則聲請人所舉之人證彭壽，程克祥，縱到案證明被吿有如何協助抗戰，如何援救中央工作人員情事，亦不能謂爲足以影響於原判決之重要證據，更不能謂原判決對於上開人證漏未審酌，有何重大錯誤；況被告周佛海乃叛國之罪　禍首，其所設施，無非意圖顛覆政府。綜其罪狀，可謂死有餘辜，……從而本件聲請再審，即興首開條項所規定之條件不符，該聲請人依據首開條項聲請再審實無理由。</p>
<p>據土論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條第一項，及刑事訴訟法第四百二十七條第一項裁定如主文。』</p>
<p>裁定書之末並附開：「如不服本裁定，應予送達後五日內、向本院提出抗吿狀，抗吿於最高法院。」此項裁定書，將於廿八日送致周妻。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕周逆佛海之　　請再審書狀經首都高院於廿七日午後裁定駁回後，謝冠生部長於下午五時的見首都高院趙琛院長就該案有所垂詢。趙氏常報吿聲請業經駁回，並已通知周妻，可提抗吿，謝部長當即表示：周案重大，囑依法審愼處理，藉示公正，並維司法尊嚴。</p>
<p>〔又電〕首都人士正緊張注意周逆執行死刑之消息。唯觀過去伏法之林梅諸逆之例，其執行多在抗吿狀經最高法院駁回後，及第二次聲請再審前，周逆榮爲「奸貴」，且其「功勞」實與其罪過並較林梅爲大？司法當局河能亦予以同等待遇，謝冠生部長已表示執行令尙未頒下，周逆或可再茍延數日，唯一般之議論，均以周逆罪大惡極，應迅速伏法，以維正氣。</p>

<h3>社論　英蘇關係的新展望</h3>
<p>由於蒙哥馬利元帥訪問莫斯科的結果，頓使一年來　　不安的英蘇關係呈現了新的光明。英蘇之間在戰時為盟友，可是在戰後英蘇間的關係之未能臻於協和，亦為眾所周知的事。艾德禮的執政雖嚷著向左轉的口號，卻未能在實際上對英蘇關係的改善有何成就。英國之對於蘇聯原有傳統的恐慌，加上了戰後蘇聯在歐洲勢力的擴張，處處與英國傳統的利益相衝突。這表現在希臘的政局上，表現在特港問題的處理上，表現在德國管制的問題上，至於英國的退出波闌，尤使此次世界大戰失郤了它最初的意義。在蘇聯、也原有對於西歐的嫉視，加以英美關係的緊密，英美軍事談判的進行，軍備標準化的採行，北極方面的軍事演習，和原子能秘密的保有；此在蘇聯縱不認爲敵意，心中終覺不安。所以一年以來英蘇關係就在這種不即不亂的情况下；這其間雖有去歲七月英國工黨領袖拉斯基敎授的訪蘇，和以名小說家普利斯特來氏所率領的文化訪問團的訪問蘇聯，但對於英蘇關係在實質上的改進，郤並無多火裨益。</p>
<p>到了最近，由於外相貝文在十二月廿二日所發表的外交演說，更引起了莫斯科眞理報的抨擊，轉使英蘇關係趨於惡化。眞理報以爲外相貝文的聲明裏，會說英國的外交政策並未與美國勾結，亦未與任何國結不解緣，認爲貝文此言表示英國已將對蘇同盟條約置之不顧。此論一出，雖經英外交部的否認，郤未能减少蘇聯對於英國的疑慮。因此，在這個時候，我們看見有英帝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥的訪英；此在蒙哥馬利元帥雖僅爲履行前此的邀約，但無疑地，蒙哥馬利元帥此行，又是英政府圖謀改善英蘇關係的一張王牌。可是儘管有像蒙哥馬利元帥這樣人物的訪蘇，郤未能消除蘇聯對於英國的疑慮。據英國路透社所發電訊，在克林姆之送別宴會中，史達林曾詢蒙帥，簽訂英蘇軍事同盟之機會如何，蒙帥沈思片刻答曰：英蘇豈非已有軍事同盟之簽訂乎？史達林答曰：余係指眞正之同盟而言，並非指貝文同盟而言。由此可見即在蘇聯的元首，對於貝文前此所作的聲明，猶具有如眞理報相同的見解。這一種誤會一直到本月廿五日由英國外交部發表貝文與史達林間所交換之電交後，始吿澄清，雙方不但重申了一九四二年英蘇同盟約繼續有效，史達林且表示願意增強此次同盟關係，主張刪去其中可以削弱前項同盟條約之各種保留條款。由於此一換文的公表，兩國重申了同盟條約之有效，頓使英蘇關係又展開了一廣大的新局面。</p>
<p>値得我們注意的是：究竟英蘇關係可能有怎樣的新展開？英穌之間原有國策上的基本衝突、加以在英國又有對蘇聯的傳統的恐懼和蔑視；在蘇聯又有傳統的對西歐的疑慮。這種傳統的成見不因執政者的變異即變異；工黨政府所採取的政策固無殊於以邱吉爾所領導的保守黨政府，就是無產階級專政的蘇聯社會主義政府亦無殊沙皇時代的專制政府。但是値此世界第二次大戰之後，英國固已精疲力盡，它的實力遠不如前，就是蘇聯値戰亂破壞之餘，縱有新五年計劃的付諸實施，其實力亦不如前；况英美保右原子能的秘密，蘇聯在新武器的製作上，又膛乎英夫之後。因此在這個時候，雙方俱有不輕啓戰端的意念們看見有的，看見蘇</p>
<p>然而儘管英蘇間有這種新接近的表示，英蘇新關係的展開，必求諸於一個更大的角度，始能見其端倪。現在史達林旣要求刪去那些足以削弱的英蘇同盟約保留條款；在事實上英蘇同盟條約訂於對希特勒作戰方酣之際，現在時過境遷，當初簽訂同盟時的情緒未必同於今日，且如今又有聯合國機構的組織，爲確保世界持久和平的努力。因此英蘇新關係的展開，這其間的關鍵，似乎不僅關係英蘇兩國，且牽涉到英蘇兩國以外的其他方面。這是為此，所以我們看見代表英國政府說話的倫敦泰〕晤使報有這樣的論調：「不幸的誤會已導致幸運的結果，增進英蘇關係的次一步驟，將在三月間莫斯科會議中求之」。從而可知，英國對於英蘇新關係的展開，尙有期待於莫斯科外長會議的召開，而在此外長會議召開的前夕，美蘇關係郤不因美國務卿的易人而有改善的跡象。相反地，美國務院官員郤於此際指責蘇聯宣傳機關企圖使東歐及中國人民轉而反美，似乎頓使美蘇關係又蒙受了一層新的陰影。</p>
<p>可是新任美國務卿的馬歇爾元帥卻是一位具有卓越才能的軍事外交家，又是一位能夠得到蘇聯信任及擁戴的人物。馬歇爾元帥在中國一年的居留，使他能够從一個新的角度來估計蘇聯，如今馬歇爾元帥既將以美國務卿的身份，前往莫斯科出席外長會議；當茲英蘇關係好轉聲中，此一外長會議的召間的莫斯科會議，當茲英蘇關係好轉聲中，此一外畏會議的召開，說不定不僅足以增進英蘇關係，日或更將促使英美蘇三强之間產生一種新的諒解，英蘇新關係的展開，必在一個更據六的基礎下纔有它的意義。我們但願這種新諒解能够整生出來，使戰後世界的持久和平能够得以確保。</p>

<h3>浙贛邊境行</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員蔣虹</p>
<p>十四日衢州訊</p>
<p>浙贛路　饒段通車快一旬了，記者爲了明瞭沿綫狀况，所以冒着隆冬的嚴寒決定了此次一百餘公里的短程旅行。</p>
<p>九日　晨，天色灰暗地似要降雨，一起身即匆匆驅車至衢州站，道時李車長已遠遠地佇立在站前迎接我了，我們邊談邊走，在站里走了一圈，一幢矮小的新站屋立在尙未剷平的基地上，旁邊的行李房和對面的倉庫還未造好。月台上堆着許多貨物，有的是昨晚卸下的，有的尙待起運。露天的月台如果驟然降兩，那些紙張等貨物是很齡腦筋的。八時正，列車開動了，因爲</p>
<p>路軌墊石未舖　每時只走十五公里我是坐在守車裏的，那三分之一節列車改裝的守車大部份的空間被一隻大保險箱佔去了，留下來的空隙也被四位行車人員和記者五個人塞滿了。我們圍着一隻火盆在撩天，從前任局長張自立談到新任局長侯家源，從復軌談到加薪。他們對侯局長的觀感可拿一位隨車司事的話來代表，他說：「侯局長到底還不錯，一上任就給我們加薪……」現今的一切事物都是拿金錢來衡量的，聽了他們的談話，我有如此的感覺。</p>
<p>車過後溪街站　速率漸快，不過每小時也僅僅是二十公里而已。後溪街的站屋也是新建的，不過比衢州站小，門窗是木板製的，不及衢州站玻璃的漂亮。</p>
<p>至江山站，窗外北風更緊了，月台上的路警把頭緊縮在大衣領裏。通車至衢州後的江山站是頓形冷落了，月合上只有幾個挑担的鄉下人在候車，其餘就是穿藍制服的車務人員了，記者跨上前面客車，乘客擁擠得水洩不通，四個外籍敎徒在高傲而安閒地玩「撲克」，一羣鄕巴佬圍着在出神地凝視，像看一件新奇的事物般地專注。</p>
<p>車至新塘邊站，廿二次下行車還未到達（本來二次客車在此交會），後來從站裏得到消息，才知道廿二次車在玉山站三道軌出軌，原因是枕木霉爛，鐵軌下陷所致。</p>
<p>站中也會出軌　眞是罕聞。近來出軌之事時有所聞，如上月廿九，卅兩天連續在玉山，凟口間，金橋，沙溪間出軌。幸浙贛綫車行速率甚低，均無何重大損失。</p>
<p>下午一時許車抵王山站，此地較其他各中途站熱鬧，月台上堆滿貨物。因在此地機車要上水，所以有半小時停止，車上乘客經過六小時光景的震動，都需要吃飯了，於是競相下車覓食，站對面各種食攤生意興隆，一下功夫一長列的攤兒都被主顧像蒼蠅般附滿了。路局在王山站設有玉山機廠一處，衢饒段機車都由這兒檢查，修補，，現在工塲中正在趕製客車，目前已有三等客車五輛出廠，不久又有二輛可以完成。下午三時半抵饒，一百二十公里的短程總算以八小時的功夫完成了。</p>
<p>上饒，這個戰時興起地方，由於地理的優良，今日仍不失爲</p>
<p>贛東商業樞紐　街上行人熙來攘往，熱鬧似前，可惜街道已不如三年前完整了，石砌的路面己被獨輪車闢出交錯的江河，和連片的沼澤，十字路口都被木柵，石塊攔了一面，連人力車通過也感困難，據說是爲了禁止汽車在市區通行，因噎廢食，這種手段實在太不高明了。另一面小包車仍在街上飛來馳去，這豈不成了一幅强烈的對照。</p>
<p>這裏街上多的是十一軍官總隊的官員，最近他們奉令與十二總隊合併，就要開去杭州。正因爲合併及其他關係，尙有四百來名無業軍官未被收訓，滯留在上饒，食住無着，厥朧至慘。記者親眼看見一位無業軍官在一家飯館裏吃了飯付不出錢，寗願掌櫃把他送進警局。爲了這數百人的生活，上饒縣政府雖撥了五十萬元作為資送返籍之用，並在中正堂辦理登記事宜，但每人分配起來僅有一千餘元，杯水車薪，又何濟於事呢？</p>

<h3>四強訂立四十年盟約　防止德重整軍備　華府方面表示將舊案重提</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕禁止德國重振軍備四十年條約，係前國務卿貝爾納斯一年餘以前所提出，聞史達林本人在某一點上贊同此議，但其後莫洛托夫外長加以反對，從未允許此案在任何四張會議中鄭重討論。迨至去年十二月四外長紐約會議時，始行商定以條約提案，列爲今年三月間莫斯科會議之第四項議程。因此該案之重要性，幾可與德奧和約相等，事實上或可認為全部德國和的之一部份。馬歇爾國務卿未着手條約計劃，但其手下各專家與顧問確切感覺的，英此。半眞理報指責英外相貝文廢棄英蘇盟的，及至貝文外相與史達林交換照會，前者保證忠於盟約，後者接受此項保證，關係始吿圓滑期，曾首先向美國人表示親善，繼之又向英國表示親善，華盛頓方面認爲此乃隔離西方各國之陰謀。就同盟問題而論，美官方認爲此種同盟，倘永遠在聯合國憲章機構之內，自無妨碍，同時在欽洲方面，盟約可以增進各國之團結，而樹立通俗的安全感。</p>

<h3>日本賠償計劃　美擬立即實施　對蘇加兩國未提意見表不滿</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕官方今日宣稱：蘇聯與加拿大對於美國立即分配日本賠償計劃，擬延遲其實施。國務院曾於去年十一月請關係各國共同草擬訓令，以便發與麥帥，指示如何先行分配日本賠償百分之十五至百分之二十。蘇聯與加拿大迄置之不理。中，英，法，澳，紐齊蘭，菲律賓，印度及荷蘭八國則分別向國務院提出意見。美國政府現將不顧蘇聯與加拿大意見如何，考慮進行步驟。中國與菲律賓等國對於日本賠償分配事宜遲不進行，深表不滿，主張將已經指定之日本工廠機器，從速拆運，否則任其生銹，將不適用。蘇聯代表原曾在十一國遠東委員會內阻止成立協議，加拿大何以置之不答，則不得其解，該國代表或者即可表示意見，並望蘇聯代表最後亦能共同討論。美蘇爭執乃以賠償之界限爲主，蘇聯堅持其軍隊在中國東九省所獲者，應作「戰利品」論。鮑萊報吿書反對此點，以爲蘇聯在東九省搬運機器已使該處價値美金一一十億元之工業無法恢復。蘇聯搬去之此種機器如作爲賠價，則其於日本賠償應得之分配額應當减少。美國對於日本賠償如何分配雖未詳細規定，但主張中國，澳洲，菲律賓及印度，應得大部份。</p>
<p>加拿大聲明</p>
<p>〔聯合社渥太華廿六日電〕加拿大外交官員今日宣稱：關於日本賠償分配事宜，美國因加拿大尙未提供意見表示不滿，殊可駭異。實則此事正在考慮中，加拿大即可提出建議。加拿大內閣遲遲未能決定政策，固屬實情，但此純係出於某種情形，非加拿大主管機關所能爲力。要之，加拿大遲不答復，絕無惡意存於其間云。</p>

<h3>今日的邱吉爾</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約記者徐鐘佩</p>
<p>「江山代有賢毫出，各領風霜十年。」</p>
<p>最近英國為羅斯福建立紀念碑，為銅像該坐立討論了很久。「新聞紀事報」應時的畫了一張漫畫，畫題是「爲生者立像」原是羅斯福坐的那張椅子裏，空空　　的坐着一個滿臉愁容手足無措的杜魯門，旁邊的一個斜傾着搖搖欲倒的邱吉爾的立像。</p>
<p>這真是象徵着目前的邱吉爾，這一倒是倒在他現在的環境裏，並非連過去也一起倒台。邱吉爾是一代重臣，在飛彈製擊下，領導着英國歷盡艱辛的走上勝利之路，他輝煌的過去是無法給人遺忘的，真像一個落日，那怕已墜入地平綫，還有他滿身光芒。</p>
<p>他依然擁有人民的愛戴，依然是一個最被尊敬的英國人，他在議會裏演講，有如父子訓子，議員對他，也有如子姪輩的執禮。但，這一中切過去的光業，在現實裏只是影子，如果說得好聽些，這些是超時代的。一個議員說得好：「議會裏逢邱吉爾演講時，大家把本來討論的題目擱起，恭敬的諦聽他的演購，聽他對政府攻擊，待他講畢　座時，大家再拾起打斷的話頭，重新討論。」他的出現只是一個沒有切到正題的插曲。</p>
<p>英國老英雄</p>
<p>許多政論家，雖然對道有功國家的老英雄，還沒有恣意的運用他們尖刻的筆，但也已經對他表示了公然的不滿。這些政論家裏，有許多是戰時竭力捧邱吉爾的，現在却態度大變。他們的變態並不是出於勢利，而是一個政論家回答得好：「判斷一個人，不能單憑他的過去—尤其在他還在政治上活動的時候。</p>
<p>邱吉爾當然還是政治上的活動人物，上次選舉裏保守黨雖敗，但他依然是反對黨的領袖。他講得動聽，寫得動人，是一位才子。傑出政論家的背棄他”是爲着他的一切政策都落在時代之後，甚至可以說是沒有政策。</p>
<p>艾德禮可愛</p>
<p>邱吉爾的後繼者哎德禮，雖不能言善語，但說話中肯，而且凡見過他的，無不深感也態度的誠懇。他肯忍耐，肯吃虧，全沒有半點驕橫自大的神情。他一年半當政來的政績，使人民愛他，使政論家開始發現他的種種優點。加以他的助手選的好，莫里遜，貝文都能稱職。和繼羅斯福當政的美國一批幹員比來，英國的戰後政府顯得成熟，顯得熟於駕馭一切。因此在美國苦憶羅斯福時，英國人覺得他們沒有邱吉爾政府一樣的頭頭是道，甚至政府具體的政策比邱吉爾政府精彩得多—這一點是邱吉爾的致命傷。</p>
<p>邱吉爾又何嘗不想急起直追？意識到外界變化的，當莫過於他自己。他在富爾頓演說，在歐陸巡行，也無非要保持自己的動力。最近他還預備堅强黨的組織，把保守黨改名爲統一保守黨。</p>
<p>勞工黨的黨報「每日先鋒」報政論家福脫挖苦他說”其實保守黨內一切分歧，改名統一也是徒然，決不會統一。但這未來統一黨內，有一件事却是大家一致的，就是邱吉爾儘可去理頭寫他的回憶錄，儘可到歐洲許多小國家去演講歐陸自成一家，却不必再苦苦的戀棧這反對黨黨魁頭銜。</p>
<p>勞工黨和保守黨是對立的，福脫此說，當然不無過火之處，但刪去黨爭中的設罵部分，福脫的話也有他的眞理。保守黨的一般年輕小伙子自知自己黨內的黨針已經落後，有志起來洗刷。因此據說也或明或暗的希望老的隱退，但每逢有這種謠言，邱吉爾必然來一决公開的：「我還要繼續領導保守黨。」</p>
<p>自由黨態度</p>
<p>勞工保守兩黨以外的自由黨，現在和政府亦步亦趨，配合得很好，爲此也免不了對享盡了盛名的邱吉爾有冷譏熱諷，認爲他對艾德禮政府的責備未免苛刻，艾德禮在謙虛和容忍裏反而顯出了大度。</p>
<p>共產黨對邱吉爾的態度不言而喻，以邱吉爾對史達林的攻擊，共產黨目不免對邱吉爾恨入切骨。</p>
<p>在報界裏，「泰晤士」報是獨樹一幟的獨立派，擺脫一切黨派。但在邱吉爾在議會裏提出「政府知道蘇軍在歐洲約有二百師之多嗎」時，「泰晤士」報也曾爲文斥責邱吉爾，認爲如果邱吉爾知道情報是實，他就該通知政府，不該當衆叫囂。</p>
<p>但在邱吉爾自己，還是有一股倔强，固執，任性和不服輸的精神，他一面沉醉在過去的光榮裏寫他的回憶錄，一面依然在議會裏領導反對黨，他雖年邁，但他絕不肯做成第二個勞合喬治。</p>
<p>時間最無情</p>
<p>可惜的是，時間是無情的，邱吉爾為英軍撇離埃及的抗議，為印度獨立的爭執，和勞工政府的政策相較，顯見得如何晦暗，也顯見得時代已把邱吉爾撇在後面。在議會裏，為印度問題他發表過緬懷過去榮譽的一篇演辭。講得雖動人，但在這急待解決的問題前，在舉世認爲印度獨立是勞工政府的賢明措置時，他這一番追懷又顯得怎樣陳腐和不必要了。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的身望無疑的是在降，隨着他一起降的是保守黨的尊嚴，一位自由黨政論家甚至推測今後保守黨恐怕永無執政機緣。但在記憶結實的民間，他依然是一位傳奇式的英雄——雖然他的傳奇也已是屬於過去的了。</p>
<p>在皇室，他也依然爲他們敬愛，他的父親是墨爾巴洛公爵，他是貴族，和皇室常有接觸。首相每週照例要覲見皇帝，報吿施政情形，據說當年邱吉爾執政，入朝覲見時，總在午前，在皇宮和帝后午餐，談笑至三時始散，現在的艾德禮首相覲見時總在下午六時，談完匆匆而去，至多也只和皇帝喝一口酒而已。</p>
<h3>保障國家安全　需要強大軍隊　美陸長鼓吹普遍軍訓　加緊準備應付原子戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕陸長柏德遜今日在婦女國防會發表演說，列舉美陸軍之三項基本需要，俾與國家安全之適當保障。據稱，美國必須建立一百萬人以上之強大軍隊，普遍軍訓，必須實行。過去在戰　初現，以迄風雨驟至，中間尚有相當時期，可以從事訓練，將來則並無此項準備時間。戰爭勃發之最初暗示，即為炸彈與無綫電操縱之飛彈，紛紛墜落於我國都市。陸軍預算六十七億美元已減至僅足應付其最低限度之基本需要。戰略空軍司令凱南則稱，美國在未來戰爭中將爲被攻擊之第一個目標。　〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國戰略空軍司令凱南繼起演說稱：在未來世界大戰中，美國將爲第一個被攻擊之目標，敵機自兩面來襲，最初廿四小時內可殺傷二千五百萬人。在希特勒第一交與其部下之名單中，美國將列第一位。實行攻擊者爲有駕駛員與無駕駛之飛機。無綫電操縱之飛彈及火箭等，一律裝載原子彈·超等爆炸彈。超等燃燒彈。及細菌彈。或其他流行之集團毀滅武器云。</p>
<p>英埃談判逆轉，失敗原因為雙方對蘇丹問題意見參商，英軍撤離埃境一點較易解決，圖為英軍退出開羅時舉行之簡單儀式。</p>

<p>潘議長並將與宣局長鐵吾談話經過發表，渠稱，本人曾向宣局長表示，此次事件乃消防處之責任，消防機構雖係另一系統，但與警局有關。過去本巿有此類陋習，希望現在不再發生。消防人員待遇雖菲薄，但救火係一種義勇行為，値得吾人欽佩，此種義勇精神，實不應受到不良影響而破壞之。是故要求嚴正調查。當時據宣局長聲稱，此事決予嚴厲調查，如查有不法人員，定予嚴辦。同時尤希望受害巿民挺身而出，自動檢舉，切勿隱忍，個人絕對不袒護　員，極盼巿民與政府合作糾正不良風氣。宣局長並立即電話通知消防處長，着令聯合保甲，會同有關人員，多方面調查並訪問受害居民。</p>
<p>最後潘議長懇切期望巿民勿再如過去情形吃了虧忍氣呑聲，必須改革以往陋習，否則社會惡劣風氣將永不能糾正。同時巿民旣負擔巿政當局繁多之捐稅，但當局對於巿民之生命財產，亦應隨時顧到，予以保險。</p>
<p>參會有　權公開訊問</p>
<p>又昨據參議會方面表示，對於此次消防處失職，參議會有權作公開訊問，目前已單獨分往出事地點詳細調查中。又警局本定於昨日公開報告其調查後之眞相，後因事主王雲甫昨赴警局時，未與負責人會晤，至無結果，唯據警局方面稱，依據日來調查所得，尚不能充分證明消防處有失職之處。</p>
<h3>五人委會　今午會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巿政府決組議一「五人委員會」，專為調查並商討處理此次西摩路大火案。此五人由巿府，警察局代表，第十區（靜安）區長，災戶代表，參議會代表張逎作等組成。</p>
<p>據巿長談稱，組織五人調查委員會之目的，乃在於便利受害事主，獲得公開檢舉之機會。如查有實據，本人及宣局長必予嚴究。吳巿長會於昨午召見消防處長周兆祥，有所詢問。並定今日下午三時，在巿府大禮堂召開首次五人委員會，巿長將親自出席主持。</p>
<p>又巿參議會已請警政委員會召停人張迺作·費樹聲·侯寄遠及參議員諸文綺·錢乃文等會同調查。</p>
<h3>地檢處密切注意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案，地檢處亦已密切注意，如消防人員確有趁機勒索·刦取財物·或灌救不力等賣職行為，實屬罪大惡極，國法決不寬貸。首席檢察官黃亮昨對記者表示，希各界對該案提供確實證據，以便偵查。</p>
<h3>陳霆銳函正副議長　中區火政　主張民辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前工部局華董現任參政員陳霆銳，昨致函潘議長徐副議長，略謂「友人張已振，此次在西摩路大火中，亦為受害人之一，昨日本人前往慰問時，據張君談稱，關於火災情形，與申報大公報所記載者大致相同。現王姓家人俱在，當不難一查眞相·按火政為巿政最重要之一，巿民身家性命所繋，消防人員今竟任其延燒十三小時之久，耳聞所及，大有人間何世之感。公等為民喉舌，全巿同欽，弟有同感，敢以巿民身份，請會同巿政當局澈底查究，以明責任，不勝幸甚。再則火政重要，盡人皆知，與其由政府辦理而腐敗，不如由巿民自辦而整飭。本巿滬南閘北之義勇消防成績卓著，即其前例。將來中區火政是否應歸民辦，似可在巿參議會中「加討論也」。</p>

<p>近來英國上院討論對華事件司法大臣喬維持勛爵及上議員艾爾文等俱表示希望中英商約中規定，英國船隻，得自由航行於中國沿海及內河，引起航業界極大注意。記者特於昨日往訪輪船公會秘書長李雲良氏，叩詢對於上項問題之意見。據李氏談稱，國人此時所疑慮者，將來簽訂中英商約，名為平等，而實際上對於中國幼稚航業，缺乏保護的成份，竟成為英國片面的優惠，或者如外界謠傳所稱，中英另有交換條件，使英國船隻，得重享我內河及沿海之特權，此應請政府判明利害，勿蹈雅片戰爭以後之覆轍，致使中國航業永無抬頭之日云去。</p>

<h3>困犯遇赦出獄後　善後問題　有待籌謀　女犯已有救濟辦法　童犯百餘送敎養院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海監獄昨又繼續開釋合乎大赦免開刑規定之人犯共八十四名，大部為烟犯。監獄門前聚集囚犯家屬甚多，見過釋者步出大門時，即上前　問其在獄親屬之近况，及出獄日期。日內該獄將繼續有人開釋。又昨日北浙江路臨時看守所亦釋出十五名。</p>
<p>截至昨日為止，大赤出獄之人數，上海監獄計一千零二名，女監一百四十三名，　院方面約在一千三百名左右。</p>
<p>獲赦出獄者之善後問題，頗為社會各界所關習。蓋如步出獄門，無家可歸，仍無法生活，難免再陷法綱，如此社會治安，又將蒙受影響。記者為此曾往訪本巿司法界某知名之士，據稱，　　旣頒佈大赦令，事前當必考慮及此問題。然記者目睹出獄犯人中身無分文，被履單薄，或鄉途遙遠者，不在少數，現知女犯當出獄時，女監方面曾發放自善後救濟繼署領得之黑布棉旗袍共一百件，身無分文者，則助以車資，共三萬餘元。無家可歸者，則由婦女出監保護會加以收容。該會係由在獄佈道已十四年之洋　浜天主堂潘福　　所主持，地址在南巿肇嘉路天佑里一號。現由該處收容救濟者共十餘人。男犯方面則未聞有保護會之類救濟機構僅出獄時發放寒衣，或補助一部份路費。另有童犯一百餘保，過去為廣牛黨或水老鼠，則定今日集中送往漕河　難童敎養院，加以訓練，並授以生活技能。</p>

<h3>上海影壇三十年</h3>
<p>前言：上海的電影界，正陷入苦閱而可憐的境遇中。社會的不景氣，電影市塲的狹窄，不消說，是目下電影事業不振的客觀原因。勝利了一年多，國產片總共還不到二十張，而內容又是那麽的不够充實，技術又是那麽的不够水準，說來實在可憐！</p>
<p>其次，外國影片的大量銷入，也是中國電影事業的致命傷；放眼看：上海或甚至中國的電影界，可說完全爲外國片所佔據，而這些外國片的內容，百分之八十都是娛樂性質，如果說有敎育的意義，也是反面的。你說那些擁抱，偵探，歌舞和全武行的五彩片能給你多少敎育意識呀？這並不是說，西片商在惡意地麻醉中國人民，但愈無聊的片子到中國來却愈賣錢！事實昭然，母庸多說。</p>
<p>再其次，電影界的本身，無須諱飾地有着許多主觀條件的缺陷。諸如人材的缺乏，設備的簡陋，組織管理的不够健全妥當，使上海的電影事業，（實際上也就是整個中國的電影事業，）到今日還是「弱不禁風」。</p>
<p>上海的電影界曾爲事業而努力，有過不算小的貢獻，然而受着主觀上以及客觀上種種原因的束縛，還不能收到滿意的成效—尤其暗現在！但環境雖然困難，身爲電影界的拓荒者，却絕對沒有退縮自餒的理由！</p>
<p>關於這些，有許多的專家，化文工作的前輩先生，提供過許多寳貴的意見，無庸贅述。這要記着的，正是上海電影界從萌芽時期到現在的一段珍貴的歷史，記者並不奢望這文字會帶給什麼，但希望能體騐這一段眞實的故事。—上海的電影事業是怎樣成長的。</p>
<p>萌芽時期　民國六年</p>
<p>有一個美國影片商人帶了攝彤機件到中國，想經營電影製片事業，却把帶來的資本十萬元蝕光了，流浪在上海。無法只得將攝影機件出售，及早回國。</p>
<p>買進這項機件底片的，是商務印書館。商務印書館便在它的照相部下，試辦製片事業，聘請留美回來的葉向榮爲攝影師，製成簡易的新聞片，有「商務印書館放工」，「盛杏蓀大出喪」，「紅十字會遊行」，「上海焚土」等短片。翌年，商務特地成立「影片部」，聘廖恩壽爲攝影師，到國內各名勝區，攝取風景影片與時事新聞，計先後攝製完成約有「廬山風景」，「西湖風景」，「北京風景」等，隨後又攝製敎育新聞片，如「女子體育館」，「養眞幼稚園」，作短片試騐，成績還有可觀。</p>
<p>因此，商務印書館便索性擴大電影事業的進行，梅蘭芳的「天女散花」和「春香鬧學」也被攝上銀幕，民七八年間，又攝成時裝片「死要錢」，「李大少爺」，「車中盜」，「孝婦羹」，「猛回頭」，「得頭彩」，「荒山拾金」，「　婿祝壽」等。是爲國人自已經營，自已製片的嚆矢</p>
<p>可是在商務印書館以前，早有「亞細亞影片公司」在上海攝製電影，但並不由國人經營。說來却又話長，還在淸宣統元年，有美國人布拉土其在上海開辦「亞細亞」拍攝了「西太后」　一片，直到民國二年，並沒有出過第二部。因維持爲難，便讓渡給該公司的經理美人依什爾接辦。依氏接辦後，拉攏上海新劇界人十，基本演員又找着錢化佛，楊潤身等人，最初的出品，是鄭正秋導演的「難夫難妻」。後來因底片來源不機，暫停數月其很又完成錢化佛主演的「二百五」，「白相城隍廟」，王先能等主演的「五福臨門」，「殺子報」，「脚踏車闖禍」，「莊子劈棺」，「長板坡」，「店夥失票」等劇。是秋二次革命時，又製成「革命軍攻打製造局」的新聞片。但翌年歐戰發生時，因底片來源又斷，即吿停辦。此後雖有「幻仙影片公司」，然而曇花一現，蝕本關門。這裏表過不提。</p>
<p>當時的電影，只看這些劇名就知道它的內容如何了，什麽「技巧」「效果」更不用談。而且演員都是男性，片中的女主角都由男演員扮演，穿了旗袍，扮着胭脂，扭扭揑揑地在銀幕上顯現，好在那時還在默片時代，倒還不需尖起喉嚨裝作女人口音。</p>
<p>國片抬頭</p>
<p>電影的開始有新轉機，是在民國八年的冬天，美國環球公司，派亨利到中國來攝取各地風景照片，在上海借商務印書館的製片部作洗片塲所，因彼此過從甚密，商務派了任彭年等隨環球公司攝影隊，週遊平津各地，爲時半年。這半年中，任彭年等才認識電影眞相，以前拍攝的電影，實在覺得太不像話，有改進的必要。當環球攝影隊返國時，便將所攬帶的攝片機械，廉價讓給商務館。</p>
<p>民國九年，該館又派郁厚培等赴美考察鴛影事業，歸來後拍攝了「蓮花落」與「大義滅親」兩片，該館電影部，直至民國十五年才獨立，改爲國光影片公司。　漸漸地，電影事業終於抬起頭來，博得社會人士的重視，民國十年，上海就新開設了三家製片公司：中國影戲硏究社，上海影片公司和新亞影片公司。</p>
<p>中國影戲研究社設立時，正値閻瑞生謀審王建英的案件轟動上海的時候，於是就把這件事作爲主幹，委託商務影片部，拍攝「閣瑞生」一片，聘當時交際花FF女士，殷明珠任主角，完成後以高價租予夏令配克大戲院，放映一星期，門庭若市。但是中國影硏社却賺了錢就趁早結束。　「上海影片公司」的第一部新片，爲殷明珠主演的「海誓」，後又拍過傅文愛主演的「古井重波記」，及但二春主演的「棄兒」。</p>
<p>新亞公司曾開拍過「紅粉骷髏」，是上海第一張武俠片。</p>
<p>製片公司　紛紛成立</p>
<p>這裏要說到在上海影壇上佔着最重要位置的「明星影片公司」它在民國十一年三月裏誕生。起初因爲沒有攝影塲的設備，借了西人老羅的玻璃棚，權作攝影塲，試攝新聞及滑稽短片，有「滑稽大王遊滬記」，「大鬧怪劇塲」，「勞工之愛情」等片。十二年開拍「孤兒救祖記」，提倡固有道德，爲觀衆讚譽，營業收入頗佳。利之所在，一般大小公司都紛紛暗地進行起來。</p>
<p>同年又有「中國影片公司」，拍攝了「新南京」與「飯桶」二片後，因資本虧盡，不得不關門大吉。</p>
<p>翌年，影片公司如雨後春笋，計十四家：</p>
<p>（名稱）　（代表作）</p>
<p>大中華　人心</p>
<p>百合　採茶女</p>
<p>崑崙　窗前足影</p>

<p>國光　不如歸</p>
<p>孔雀　孔雀東南飛</p>
<p>南國　到民間去</p>
<p>鑽石　愛河潮</p>
<p>新人　歌女恨</p>
<p>民新　玉潔冰淸</p>
<p>非非　浪蝶</p>

<p>公平　公平之鬥</p>
<p>五友　佳期</p>
<p>洋洋　落魄驚魂</p>
<p>快活林　爲友犧牲</p>
<p>當時電影事業的蓬勃，可以想見。自十五年起，至二十五年止，這十年中，影片公司此起彼仆，十分熱閙。但眞正有成績的，僅不過明星，聯華，天一，藝華，電通等數家而已。而若干家國產影片公司，根本沒有攝影機，沒有攝影塲，甚至沒有演員，僅是三五個人的結合，掛了某某電影公司的牌子就自命爲電影界中的企業者。所以製片公司雖多，國片產率却極低。即以民國二十四年爲例，是年滬上製片公司共有四十六家，而影片的出品却總共只有三十八部，而是年西片銷入總數却達三百七十八部之多。</p>
<p>有聲片的製作</p>
<p>我國第一張有聲片爲聯華影業公司的「野草閑花」，其次有明星的「歌女紅牡丹」，及聯的「虞美人」等，但是那是以蠟盤發音的。「片邊發音式」約有聲電影實騐成功後，在民國十五年最初來滬試映。到民國二十年，天一影片公司及明星影片公司，先後購製聲片攝影機，並蓋造聲片攝影塲，於是乃正式有自製聲片出現。天一的第一部聲片爲「歌塲春色」，民國二十年十月二十九日公映於新光大戲院。明星的第一部聲片爲「舊時京華」，民國二十一年五月十二日同時公映一於中央，明星兩戲院。</p>
<p>旋國人自己發明錄音機，民國二十三年，司徒慧敏等自製有聲攝影機，定名爲「三友式錄音機」，成績甚佳，能在戶外錄音，曾得中國敎育電影協會的獎狀，又得蔣主席獎勵金一萬元。三友乃組織常通影片公司，第一部製作爲「桃李刧」。當時還値得一提的，是明星公司曾一度攝製五彩片，民國廿年，明星公司鑒於歐美五彩片的流行，將「啼笑姻綠」的一部份攝製五彩，但因按術不精，成本過大，並不怎樣成功。後來在抗戰期間雖然也曾經嘗試過，但成績總不佳。直到現在，我們還不能看到一部完善的國產五彩片。</p>
<p>抗戰前後</p>
<p>上海電影的初期，風行着「火燒紅蓮寺」一類的武俠片。這種武俠片的所以能風行一時，沒有別的緣故，只是表現當時小市民階層的落後的世界觀而已！稍後，像「姊妹花」等的社會劇開始取武俠片而代之，博得廣大的觀衆。其實，這些社會劇所表示的現實的不滿和無稽的幻想，和武俠片初無二致，只是緊接着現實的社會間題，而幻想也卸去了神秘的外衣。這一個轉變，使上海的影壇從神秘之塔搬到了十字街頭，常然是一個好現象。</p>
<p>開映八十餘天而買座始終不衰的「漁光曲」，引導了國產影片都滲入「悲劇」的作風，而一般觀衆似乎也最愛看那些「悲歡離合」的戲。</p>
<p>綜說一句：抗戰以前，上海的影壇，在質的方面，多數是社會倫理等劇，在量的方面，前文已提及，就是製片公司多而出品極少。</p>
<p>抗戰以後怎樣呢？</p>
<p>在「孤島」度過一些黑暗的日子，上海的國產電影已有着本質上的改變：從一質」的爭取一變而爲「量」的擴大！</p>
<p>量的擴大，大致說來也許很不錯，讀者當然能够記得，那時的國產片是怎樣地風起雲湧。一星期間會攝製成一部「三笑」，一個月中會趕出十部影片，出品不可算不多，但是，考其內容，實在抱歉得很！各影片公司只是拼命的在生意眼上打算，抓住一般低級的觀衆，不惜粗製濫造，置內容意識於不國！古裝片流行起來，「落難公子中狀元」的故事統統搬上了銀幕，還有些什麽偵探，胡鬧的無聊片也居然活躍起來！失敗的悲觀論，宿事論。「和平」論，投降論，都和觀衆見面了！</p>
<p>為什麽國產電影有着這樣高度的「質」的退步？</p>
<p>首先，我們得指出：上海的國產電影，並沒有健全的策略，「八一三」後的電影事業，是在「試試看」的心情下做起來的，並沒有堅强的意志，因此，當惡勢力向他們襲擊的時候，他們開始徬徨而動搖了。</p>
<p>這事實，在卅年十二月八日太平洋戰爭以後，更是，昭然若揭，意志薄弱的電影從業員，投入了「大東亞」的懷抱！　太平洋戰爭後的上海影搜，一句話：「魍魅盤據漆黑一團！」</p>
<p>影壇現狀</p>
<p>勝利後，敵僞時期本市「華影」各廠經中央分別接收，前福履理路華影第二廠，改爲中央電影攝彤塲第二廠，閘北天通庵路攝影塲爲第一廠，前霞飛路華影第三廠，由軍委會政治部接收改爲第一廠，康腦脫路爲第二廠。接收後，因人才經濟，一切困難，影壇異樣的靜寂。</p>
<p>到去年年底止，國產片共映了十三部：「忠義之家』，「塞上風雲」，「京華血淚」，「聖城記」，「鶯飛人間」，「敢死警備隊」，「日本間諜」，「血濺櫻花」，「蘆花翻白燕子飛」，「鐵骨氷心」，「天字第一號」，「同病不相憐」，和「民族的火花」，正在開映約有「遙遠之愛」，「長相思」和「湖上春痕」三部，另外有幾部正在攝製中。看這數目實在是可憐得很，而其內容及技術，也很多可議之處</p>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>新聞電影　世界的耳與目</h3>
<p>新聞與電影，同是「世界的耳與目」，在這二十世紀裏，這爾件事情終於打成一片，產生了「新聞電影」。目前，我們可以在電影院裏，正片以前，能够看到一些新聞短片：國際的或是劉內的。使在娛樂與欣賞之餘，不費力地接受些時事常識，其效用且甚於白紙上的黑字！</p>
<p>第一都在上海攝製的新聞片是什麽？</p>
<p>當二十六年前的夏天，第五屆遠東運動會在虹口公園舉行時，由商務印書館的影片部，與靑年會影片主任比德博士合作，開始在會塲攝取新聞短片。共攝成了三卷：第一卷是選手入塲情形和開幕證，第二卷是各項運動決賽，第三卷是女生會操和童軍會操。這三卷東西便是中國新聞電影製作的啓幕。</p>
<p>一九二二年，霞飛將軍來滬觀光，霞飛路上，燈彩迎接，盛極一時。剛設立的明星影片公司就以歡迎霞飛的情况攝入鏡頭，作爲明星開拍電影前的一個起身砲</p>
<p>新聞片製作的與盛在一九二七年以後，民國二十九年（一九三〇）聯華成立，每月攝製「聯華新聞」，中央宣傳委員會亦一度　聯華合作，到各地攝取新聞，充實內容，名爲「中國新聞」。</p>
<p>新聞電影在戰時，允可以顯得其效果的偉大！可惜在孤島上的市民，不能與銀幕上的抗戰健兒相見握手，僅在歐戰發生後，在英國大使館裏，可以看到些天西洋畔的烽火。同時，也許讀者還記得，在德國大使館裏，也開映着納粹自我宣傳的影片。</p>
<p>現在，國外的，經常由美國新聞處等幾家供給外，國內的新聞普通由中電廠攝製，在質量上，較從前已有顯著的進步，祝努力進步！並希望新聞界與電影界密切合作，如美國的赫斯特和米高梅一般！</p>
<h3>銀海浮沉錄</h3>
<p>這裏是1936－1945十年中每年度好萊塢十大影星的芳名，有不少老明星一直抓住着寶座，也有不少的新進明星大紅大紫起來……</p>
<p>一九三六年（一）秀蘭鄧波兒（二）克拉克蓋博爾（三）琴逑羅吉絲和茀雷亞斯坦（四）羅勃泰勒（五）喬埃勃朗（六）狄克飽惠爾（七）瓊克勞馥　（八）克勞黛考爾白（九）珍妮麥唐納（十）賈萊古柏</p>
<p>一九三七年（一）秀蘭鄧波兒（二）克拉克蓋博爾（三）羅勃泰勒（四）平克勞斯貝（五）威廉鮑惠爾（六）金蕙漱（七）琴逑羅吉絲和茀雷亞斯坦（八）宋雅海妮（九）賈萊古柏（十）茂娜洛埃</p>
<p>一九三八年（一）秀蘭鄧波兒（二）克拉克蓋博爾（三）宋雅海妮（四）米蓋羅納（五）史本塞屈賽（六）羅勃泰勒（七）茂娜洛埃（八）金蕙漱（九）愛麗絲費（十）泰羅鮑華</p>
<p>一九三九年（一）米蓋羅納（二）泰羅飽華（三）史本塞屈賽（四）克拉克蓋博爾（五）秀蘭鄧波兒（六）蓓蒂黛維絲（七）愛麗絲費（八）埃洛弗林（九）詹姆士賈克奈（十）宋雅海妮</p>
<p>一九四〇年（一）米蓋羅納（二）史本塞屈賽（三）克拉克蓋博爾（四）琴亞屈萊（五）泰羅鮑華（六）詹姆士賈克奈（七）平克勞斯貝（八）華霄士皮萊（九）蓓蒂黛維絲（十）裘蒂迦倫</p>
<p>一九四一年（一）米蓋羅納（二）克拉克蓋博爾（三）亞博·考斯坦羅（四）鮑勃霍伯（五）史本塞屈賽（六）琴亞屈萊（七）賈萊古柏（八）蓓蒂黛維絲（九）詹姆士賈克奈（十）裘蒂迦倫</p>
<p>一九四二年（一）亞博·考斯坦羅（二）克拉克蓋博爾（三）賈萊古柏（四）米蓋羅納（五）飽勃霍伯（六）詹姆士賈克奈（七）琴亞屈萊（八）蓓蒂葛萊寳（九）葛麗亞嘉遜（十）史本塞屈賽</p>
<p>一九四三年（一）蓓勃蒂葛萊寳（二）鮑霍伯（三）亞博·考斯坦羅　（四）平克勞斯貝（五）賈萊古柏（六）葛麗亞嘉遜（七）亨茀萊飽嘉（八）詹姆士賈克奈（九）米蓋羅納（十）克拉克蓋博爾</p>
<p>一九四四年（一）平克勞斯貝（二）賈萊古柏（三）鮑勃霍伯（四）蓓帝葛萊寳（五）史本塞屈賽（六）葛麗亞嘉遜（七）亨茀萊鮑嘉（八）亞博。考斯坦羅（九）加萊葛倫（十）蓓蒂黛維絲</p>
<p>一九四五年（一）平克勞斯貝（二）范喬生（三）葛麗亞嘉遜（四）蓓蒂葛萊寳（五）史本塞屈賽（六）賈萊古柏和亨茀萊鮑嘉（七）鮑勃霍伯（八）裘蒂迦偸（九）麥格蘭奧勃琳（十）勞埃羅逑斯</p>
<p>這一百個名字中，實際上只有三十六個人，換句話說，從一九三六到一九四五的十年中，獲得寳座的明星共有三十六位。而且從上列表中，也可以看到好萊塢明星的浮沉跡象。</p>
<p>一九三六年到三八年，第一名寳座始終由童星秀蘭鄧波兒佔着，然而因爲年齡的增加，第四年跌到了第五位，以後就此跌出十名以外！承巷她的是米蓋羅納，做了三年的「電影皇帝」，然而第四年也跌下來了，變了第四位，下一年跌到第九位，一九四四年的十大明星中，就看不到這個淘氣明星的名字了。</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博爾，從一九三六年起，到一九四三年中，每年度他總被選在十大巨星之內；還有史本塞屈賽，那個硬派明星，從一九三八年起，到四五年，其中除了一九四三年以外，也屢次名列十大明星之內。女明星中，葛麗亞嘉遜和蓓蒂葛萊寳等也是紅得很，葛萊寳還博得一九四三年的冠軍呢！</p>
<p>奇怪的是，亞博和考斯坦羅這兩個滑稽明星竟在一九四二年弄到了第一名！至於平克勞斯貝，最近一直被推爲「電影皇帝」，他的低音歌唱，已風魔了全世界的觀衆！</p>
<p>攝影塲中</p>

<h3>央行明配暗售萬餘條　金價已無力反抗　較上週六跌落十九萬元</h3>
<p>赤昨仍遭央行所管束，晨開爲四〇六萬至四〇八萬，即有逢高之供源而趨疲，惟三九九萬之價，一度掙扎，終以登記配給關係，買戶略吿觀望，復盤低至三九五萬，央行以三九六萬之價，配給三三四〇條，入後雜色之遊資，以及京帮雖納，但央行明配外，暗售復達三千餘條，是以始終未能重越四百萬大關，嗣傳無限制配給之說，午刻乃至三九五萬左右，午後央行賣買更旺，再來隨市供給六千條，壓低至三八七萬，而後稍穩，結果較上週六跌落十九萬，飾金仍掛四一萬五，銀元微升，暗拆銀根見緊，自一角半至二角不等。</p>
<p>外幣亦告鬆弛，美鈔暗豐晨初六千九至七千一，嗣後即隨金價回低，午刻退至六千八左右，午後金市雖告步降，但美鈔尙無多大影響，雖疲而不多，結果較上週六見挫三百元，港票亦見軟化，結果較上週六跌五十元，港匯實銷有限，昨一三四〇元仍有少數成交，印匯一六三〇元，英匯二一四〇〇元，均屬有供少求，午後喊喊價稍低。</p>
<h3>華股蓄勢待發　小型鋒芒甚銳</h3>
<p>華股昨大股晨穩午疲，小股則仍在邁進，晨開小股見昂，永紗現俏遞低，開後八五號七六號有供，遞永紗曾退至八四七元，一四號一九七號二二三號八三號八五號一七一號一八六號等咸進，勤興景福商務决第漲停，現永紗升至八六三元，遞永紗八七九元高價，一九八號三六號一五六號八三號逢高有供而回降，惟尙多盤，一五六號二二四號八三號三六號等賣意不怠，金市被迫而降，現永紗見八三五元低價，遞永紗八五三元，八九號一八〇號一五八號七八號逢低有補，近午曾回升至八七〇元外，一五六號逢高仍售，午收轉盤，結果較前收計永紗微升，美亞信和各漲半成强，景福新光勤興華豐各漲一成以上，冷股商務漲停，餘均見秀，遞交永紗微升，信和美亞漲半成强，新光華豐各漲一成强，午後二二四號一三號一〇五號有售，一五六號進後忽出，一六號則賣現永紗，逐漸轉疲，一五二號有納而多掙扎，入後央行力售黄金，人心不無驚惶，每况愈下，一八六號一五六號一四號再來供售一六號仍拋現永紗，現遞永紗同吿見低，臨收時三五號來進現永紗，一五一號一五八號儿七號等則納，低後稍升，但現永紗收市價，仍以最後成交價八一六元爲準，牌價則在八二二元以上，結果較上週六計永紗信和微挫，美亞平，景福升半成，新光勤興華豐各漲一成左右，遞交永紗跌半成弱，信和微挫，新光華豐升一成不到，冷股麗安升一成，餘均平穩，塲外各股亦見回跌。</p>
<h3>公債成交無多</h3>
<p>公債昨見穩健，人心對還本傳說又有奢念，統丙晨開躍升爲二四〇〇元，自二四三〇元起，步降至二二六〇元，最後在二三〇〇元至二三五〇元間徘徊，成交僅百餘萬元，結果較舊曆年底計甲乙升四〇元，丙升一三元，丁漲二〇〇元，統戊亦升五〇元。</p>
<h3>北帮吸收怡紗</h3>
<p>外股昨北帮吸胃奇殷，全力向怡紗活動，怡紗晨開九千五，高價見萬元，高後轉疲，曾回降至九千二，惟最後仍形穩定，收後復抬高至一萬元外，結果較封關前計怡紗英聯各升一成，餘者均漲半成光景。</p>
<h3>紡管會收購國棉　蘇北可得十萬担</h3>
<p>全國紡織管理委員會爲謀增加本年度生產，近積極在蘇北一帶收購棉花，但蘇北各棉田，因受共軍之擾亂，損失甚多，現僅能在蘇北各國軍收復地區，按市價收購，此項棉花原由「大生民營紡織廠」發動收購，請紡管會協助，紡管會以協助一家民營紗廠，不如協助全區民營紗廠，以求公允，故決定將所購得之棉花，按「大生廠」「中紡各廠」及紗業公會等平均分配，至公會方面再以共分配之數，分四組分配與各會員，據紡管會負責人談稱二此次收購棉花數量不多，只有十萬担左右云。</p>
<h3>紗價先堅後疲　紗號供意甚殷</h3>
<p>昨日紗市紅盤先堅後疲，晨間因紡建開貨，延至十一時一刻掛牌，致同業中人均姗姗來遲，市塲上成交極晚，重磅紗喊價俱在二百五六十萬之間，輕磅紗僅二百十萬，與去底行市相仿，惜買戶不湧，紗號供意殊殷，致各支紗之紅盤市面，乃呈漲後復洛之象。</p>
<h3>呢絨增漲一成　紅盤僅為點綴</h3>
<p>呢絨紅盤，照歷年來之舊規，均於前日（即五路財神日）開出，今適値星期日，又兼種種環境關係，同業間議開均互相延遲，記者昨巡視棋盤街與諸茶會上，雖有若干開盤，然其未能開出而互相觀望及探詢者亦衆，有等店號，大半均存看廠方開盤後再行議開之能度，而廠家則又有待號客賣買情形再爲開盤之模樣，於是紅盤價格，成爲點綴而乏實地交易。總窺各貨，昨日所開之紅盤，平均統扯，較之過去舊臘底收盤時，大的增漲一成左右。</p>
<h3>民營油廠昨已開工</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市各民營油廠昨已開工，今日當可配售各零售商，又中國植物油公司仍照常配售，食油市塲因到貨不旺，仍未做開，惟本市各零售商配售食油，仍由各民營工廠及中國植物油公司按照原議價格配售，決不致有波動情形云。</p>
<h3>茶市喊價頗高</h3>
<p>農曆新年假期倐已消逝，茶葉同業昨亦循例上市，然以執貨人心堅俏，對於各式紅綠茶咸抱看漲之態度，因此佈樣旣稀，喊價扶搖直上，而進購者則畏高，暫取觀望。迨全收市情况尙秀，紅盤卒鮮做開。頃據業中人談稱：際此建設年中，我國茶商鑒於華茶仍未能活躍海外、故刻下猶在不斷籌劃復興之道。</p>

<h3>桐油議開紅盤</h3>
<p>白桐油自受外匯限制，國內毫無發展，已數月於茲，上年底及總結帳前，雖曾數度好轉，而業此者均不感興趣，蓋內銷縱有鋒芒，總被銷數所限，實不足以施展抱負也。洪江桐油本爲國內所銷之品，不能與白桐油相提並論，惟因成本有關，亦祇隨聲附和而已。昨日洪白桐油紅盤已開出（參閱市價欄）。</p>
<h3>進口商目前感覺　三種困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據進出口業某負責人稱：關於進口貨物，目前有三點困難不易解決，致多數進出口商行在業務上頗受影響，其困難爲：（一）在輸管會成立以前，向外國定貨，未開外匯者，其後申請外匯，央行外匯審核處不予批準，（二）已開外匯，而到期後貨物尙未裝船者，請求展期甚覺困難，（三）輸管會成立前，准許進口而不供給外匯之貨品，如水果，化裝品等，因到貨遲緩，目前多受限制或禁止，又多種工業原料如顏料等，即使列入不限額進口之例，尙覺供不應求，現將其列入限額進口之例，實足以影響我國工業之發展，凡此種種，皆深望輸管會有以改善之。</p>

<h3>秋絲雖經政府收購　廠商困難並未减除</h3>

<p>又據關係方面吿記者：政府此决所核定之收購秋絲價格，在設備完善，技術精良，經營週密之廠商，可望不致虧本。惜廠商中百分之八十，咸以囿於流動資金，對春繭貸款中本身之三成墊款，遂大多係折自高利貸款。故以低利貸款辛勤生產結果，盡付諸高利貸，談何盈餘。且尙有不少廠商，耗費於修廠設廠之資金允大，常更難言利潤。渠預洲政府本年度扶助蠶絲事業，勢將另擬根本計劃，大致將循：（一）簡化貸款手續，（二）增加貸款數額，（三）管理嚴密化三途推進云。</p>

<h3>為本學期增加學費問題　私校敎師昨請願　吳市長認目前應照參議會決議收費　潘議長允二次大會續開時提出覆議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中小學校敎職員，以市參議會二次大會議決之私校學費標準，對敎師之生活威脅頗大，除日前登報發表宣言外，復於昨日分向市政府·敎育局·及市參議會請願。</p>
<p>到市府請願　向市長面遞呈文</p>
<p>本市私立中小學七十二單位，代表計五百餘人，於昨晨十時，在新寰中學集合，分乘大卡車六輛，於十時三刻抵達市府，推派代表同義中學張光宗，明德女中許開甫·坤範女中潘芝孫·寗波六小周時選·承德中學孫承且·民立中學張維新·道中女中王賡揚·通惠小學朱雅高·崇實中學高明東·洲姚中學顧序東等二十一人，求見吳市長，並面遞呈文</p>
<p>市長意見</p>
<p>吳市長於十一時在市府大禮堂出見，首光表示對於本市私校敎職員生活困苦情形極爲關心，然有二種矛盾心理：（一）敎職員生活固甚艱苦，然家長之負担亦須顧及。（二）私校學費若一再增加，則市校必將相形見絀，待遇相差過遠之結果，必致引起市校敎職員之不平，而使市府處境困難。參議會對於此案，曾考慮再三，處理極爲愼重，且參議會爲民意機關，一切決議，應予尊重。本人建議各校，目前應遵照參議會決議收費，如有其他困難，可將學生總數，收支情形，戰前學費之比較，敎師實際生活之困苦等，循正常途徑，備文列表，請求主管當局審核後，轉參議會議訊。吳市長並强調，爲敎育者爲知識分子之領袖，一切舉動必須合乎法理，並須少發理論，　　事實。吳市長即表示本人素來重視敎育，並允於參議會再行召開時，必將代彼等據理力爭。</p>
<p>代表意見</p>
<p>市長辭畢，即由代表張光宗，許開甫等相繼發言，歷述次請願之目的，純在安定敎師生活，謂本市仍有多數私立學校經濟不公開，致敎職員待遇，始終難獲合理調整，故希望當局對於此項規定，能予澈底執行，令各私校務必將經濟完全公開，並請確切保障敎職員之職業，因往往有多數學校，以敎職員過問校方經濟，即濫予解聘者。</p>
<p>對於此點，吳市長表示學校經濟公開，必須實現，務使學費之增加，用於改善敎師待遇。對於職業保障，亦將力予支持，如有此種現象，決難容忍，敎師儘可組織調査團依法檢舉，市府決負責辦理。對各校經費如何監督，將飭主管詳細擬訂，嚴格執行。時己十二時，代表等爲表示感謝起見，全體向吳市長行一鞠躬，仍乘原車赴市敎育局請願。</p>
<p>到敎局請願　當提出三項要求</p>
<p>隊列於十二時一刻，抵達敎育局，全體集合於敎育局前之廣地上，由敎育局長顧毓琇接見。王魯之等四代表，面向顧局長提出三項要求：（一）校長方面提出：請求增加學費，（二）補助私校經費，（三）敎員方面提出：私校當局應經濟公開。</p>
<p>局長意見</p>
<p>顧局長即分別答復：（一）私校學費，暫照參議會議決案施行，可再提請覆議；（二）補助私校經費，已列入預算，財政局尚未發下；（三）私校經濟公開，為私校校長應有之責任。各代表咸感滿意，旋即　敎育局。</p>
<p>到參會請願　要求提高敎育費</p>
<p>昨日下午一時十五分，代表等又赴市參議會請願，由明德女中許開甫。同義中學張光宗·坤範女中潘芝孫等十四代表，到參會樓上，向潘議長提呈意見，歸納各代表要求各點如下：（一）要求規定鐘點費，提高敎師待遇；（二）澈底執行私校經濟公開命令，保障敎師職業；（三）私校收人確屬不足開支，再酌增學費，在可能範圍內，仍不主張增收學費；（四）要求提高市預算敎育經費至百分之三十五；（五）五萬萬元補助費如何措置；（六）市參議會對提高敎師待遇標準一節，請轉達敎育當局，迅予計劃實施。</p>
<p>議長意見</p>
<p>潘議長當即向各代表聲稱：參議會對於敎師待遇菲薄，絕對同情，敎師在報章宣言中謂參議會不顧敎師生活淸苦，實不確實，同時又提及市參議會有無權規定私校學費一點，似屬過外並不負責，同時，此議案係由市長交大會討論，大會至少限度亦應對市府交缺作一結論答覆。本人於此次會議中亦竭力同情敎師，大會討論此案時如立即決談，則增加學費一案決無法通過，特延至第二日再作討論，結果始得略予增加，但參議會通過提案，如必須推翻，亦應先予覆議，目前祗能按照決議辦法實施。第二次大會尙未結束，本人負責於開會時提出覆議，但不能保蹬一定通過。同時希望校方供給實際材料，如學校實際收支情形等，俾提　大會報吿，否則無從根據。聞敎師方面，以一二參議員反對增加學費，而藉此攻擊，似不適當，敎育界應協助政府，發揚民主政治，要養成社會善良風氣，此種態度頗不盡善。潘議長繼下樓，向其他代表發表同樣意見，並允提出大會覆議後，代表等始陸續退去。</p>
<p>吳市長明召集　私校校長談話</p>
<p>吳市長定明日（二十九日）下午三時，假山海關路市立育才中學，召集全市私立中小學校長談話，對於學費標準，及私校經濟公開問題，有所指示。</p>

<h3>光榮的一二八　十五週年感懷</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>中華民國二十一年一月二十八日，在日本帝國主義者得寸進尺的壓迫下，我中華民族發出了震驚世界的怒吼聲；這就是輝耀史書的「一·二八」戰役。</p>
<p>當時，日本已經强行佔據東北，並繼續侵略我疆土，打算實現所謂「大陸政策」，一方面，藉口僧侶被毆事件，無中生有，向我政府提出苛刻的要求；正當雙方交涉磋商之際，乘我方未有準備，即調兵猛犯淞滬，以飛機擲彈，用大砲轟擊，兩地精華，盡付一炬！</p>
<p>戰事爆發之初，日軍曾作妄語，說「祇須四小時以內，可以完全解決華軍」。但是經我駐滬軍隊奮勇抗拒，以數萬孤軍，迎拒頑敵海陸空巨大的軍力，竟也支持了整整的三十四日，不可不說是一個奇蹟，而造成這一個「奇蹟」的主要原因，全賴民衆和軍隊，打成一片，協力同心的抗鬥。</p>
<p>只要不是健忘者，我們定能追憶起當時軍民一致熱烈融洽的情景，甚至一般弱女稚子，也紛起組織救護隊，慰勞隊；靑年學生除了奔走募捐以外，更寫了無敷慰勞信分寄給前綫將土；衣不溫，食不飽的勞工，也紛紛把他們勞動所得的血汗錢，贈作軍餉。慷慨激昂的抗戰意識，充溢在大上海和全國億萬人的心胸。</p>
<p>這一戰役，我國的損失自然很大，上海和附近的大小車站全被炸毁；生產和文化機號如商務印書館，東方圖書館，三友實業社，永安紗廠，曁南，復且，持志，同濟，勞動等大學，大部皆毁於猛烈的砲火之中，人民生命與財物的損失，更無從作正確的估計。這是日本侵華數十年來首次在我國心臟區域舉行的大屠殺，也就是受盡壓迫的中華民族最初的覺體。</p>
<p>「一·二八」淞滬之戰，經過三十四日的抵抗，因爲孤軍未獲接濟，彈盡援絕，當時遂在「忍辱負重」的悲憤情緒下，和敵人訂立了屈辱的「淞滬協定」，但，正因爲能忍辱，能苦鬥，經過了這次歷史的考騐，才取得了此後全面的勝利。</p>
<p>勝利以前，「一·二八」是作爲一個「國難紀念日」的；今日奇恥旣已洗雪，恰在這廢曆新正的爆竹聲中迎接「一·二八」十五週年，其意義的深長自不待言。</p>
<p>中國人永遠不會忘記「一·二八」，並且將永遠保持傳統的戰鬥精神，努力排除今後的任何外侮！</p>
<h3>京滬月今</h3>
<p>— 本報特約稿　周正定寄自首都</p>
<p>南京上海各月平均溫度在二十度（攝氏以下同）以上者，有五個月（五至九月）或四個月（六至九月），在十度至二十度間者，有三個月（四月十月十一月）或四個月（加五月），不及十度而在零試以上者，爲十二月一月二月及三月等四個月，其氣候實具顯著之副熟帶色彩，然以地居歐亞大陸東岸，以冬夏海陸溫度之差異，氣壓互有消長，而有季風更迭之現象，冬季風源自西伯利亞，時向東南侵襲，其秉性寒冷乾爆，故京滬冬季溫度視同緯各地均低，一月僅在三度左右，最低且可降至零下十度以下，每當寒流爆發南下之際，常朔風凛冽，雨雪交加，寒氣逼人；入夏季風發自東南海上，溫高濕重，京滬天氣至爲溽暑，二地七月溫度平均咸在二十七度以上，最高甚且達四十度有奇，而天氣單調少變化，允足令人不耐，京滬天氣以晚春及初秋爲最多變化，晚春多颶，而初秋多颱，颶多源自內陸寒暖氣流之鋒面上，其行徑槪自西向東，或自西南向東北，過境之時，每陰雨綿綿，連日不開，六月間之梅雨，即由於颶過境頻繁所致，梅雨期間，降雨的佔全年總量四分之一，關係稻作甚重，颱發目西太平洋熱帶洋面，以夏秋之交爲最盛，每自東南向西北進襲，時有在風暴雨隨至，常致巨災，爲禍漁航，允稱浩烈，但炎夏餘威，往往爲所一掃而空，天氣頓轉淸涼，於京滬居民亦不無裨益也。</p>
<p>以年雨量論，南京地稍內陸，故顯遜上海，南京全年平均計九七八公厘，上海則達一一二八公厘，惟各月分配殊大致類似，集中於春厦兩季，南京夏季六·七，八三個月之雨量，佔全年百分之四十二，一春季（三·四·五月）佔百分之二十四；上海夏季各月雨量佔全年百分之四十一，春季佔百分之二十四，合計均達百分之六十五左右，全年惟秋季最稱晴朗，天高氣爽，日暖風和，有小陽春之目。</p>
<p>一月：臘梅初開　迎春始放</p>
<p>本月爲京滬最冷之時，西伯利亞高氣壓掩蓋全國，爲勢極强，時驅使寒流爆發南下，其前鋒過境，每氣壓陡升，氣溫驟降，朔風怒號，泥土凍結，寒刮川膚，霜雪之多，爲全年各月之最，月平均溫度三度左右，極端最低，南京曾達零下十三度八（一九三三年一月二十七日），上海亦至零下十二度一（一八九三年一月十九日），惟二地因近海濱，偶以海洋氣流之調劑，絕對最高亦可達二十度左右，月之二十一至二十五日，爲南京最寒之時，五日平均爲一度，上海最寒在十六至二十日，五日平均溫度的三度，本月雨量僅較十二月稍多，居少雨月之第二位，南京平均爲三十八公厘，上海爲五十公厘，雨日較前三月略增，平均的九日，又以常在高氣壓統治下，晴天亦多，平均在八天左右，惟都市多塵，（本月微塵較各月均多）晴夜地面輻射甚劇，低空時多烟霧，視界不遠，（能見度最小）濃霧平均月達四，五天，晴日陽光不强，蒸發量爲各月之最小者，月之中旬，臘梅放苞，下旬迎春始華。</p>
<p>二月：迎春花盛春梅始華</p>
<p>本月兩地平均溫度在四度左右，較一月稍高，視十二月略低，仍爲冬冷時期，極端最低均曾降至八度半，（京一九二五年二月一日，滬一九一〇年二月二日）最高溫度可達二十五至二十八度，二十日以後，兩地嚴寒已减。本月雲量及濕度均爲冬季三月之最高者，故日照時間遜於上月，雨量略見增加，平均南京四十六公厘，上海六十公厘，最多時均的及準平均之三倍，雨日九至十日，霜雪漸減，雷雨已可能發生，風向仍以北及北東北居多，但其頻數較上月减少，平均風速漸大，是月中旬，春梅始華，迎春花盛。</p>
<p>三月：春回大地　柳綠桃紅</p>
<p>本月爲由冬入春之過渡期，溫度較差至大，如以每候（五日一候）平均溫度十度爲冬春之分野，則南京之春始於月之十七日，上海始於二十七日，全月平均溫度八至九度，雖較冬季三月爲暖，然較之晚秋（十一月）則低二至三度，雲量較前後兩月均少，相對濕度爲全年之最小者，日照視前後兩月均較多，雨量微有增加，平均南京六十二公厘，上海八十三公厘，雨日十至十二日，冬夏季風競爭劇烈，爲一年中風力最强之時，宜乎爲習俗放風箏之季節，每於强烈之西北風起，塵土飛舞，障蔽天日，霾日之多，冠全年各月，風向雖仍以北東北居多，然東東南風之百分比，已足與之抗衡，南京雪期平均於月之十日告終，霜日終於十九日，上海終止期相彷而略平，月之中旬：桃始華，柳始葉，下旬；蛙始鳴，雁絕見，紫荆始華，鳶飛魚躍，漸開春景之端。</p>
<p>四月：蠶月條桑　柳棉飛絮</p>
<p>時屆仲春，承上月冬夏季風戰劇戰之後，風力仍强，東南及東東南風之盛，已居首席，月平均溫度在十四度左右，與伸秋之十月比，尙遜三至四度，兩地最高溫度均曾達三十三度以上，最低曾降至負一度左右，本月颶之過境至頻，雨水見豐，平均在九十三至九十七公厘間，僅次於六七八（九）各月，而居第四（或第五）位，所謂「迎梅雨」即其時也，上海霧日以此月特多，雨日各有十一二十三日，以降水時數言，乃全年之最多者，是月上旬：紫荆盛華，桃李初姸，中旬：柳絮飛舞，燕語樑間，下旬：鶯囀枝頭，春光普照，春色滿野。</p>
<p>五月：大麥黃熟　桐葉茂長</p>
<p>是月爲東南及東東南風頻數最盛之時，和風拂拂，兩地月平均溫度已在十九至二十度間，南京上中兩旬，猶存暮春天氣，下旬已邁入夏季，上海夏季開始期尙在下月十日，（均以逐候平均溫度大於二十二度爲入夏之標準）本月颶有長趨黄河下游之機會，因之長江下游，陰雨較少，雨量（平均京七十九公厘滬九十三公厘）及雨日（京十日滬十二日）均遜於前後兩月，雲量减而日照大增，旅行遝動，是月最宜，上旬：櫻桃實熟，布穀初鳴，中旬：桐葉茂，下旬：榴始華，割麥插禾，此其時也。</p>
<p>六月：棟花開後　梅子熟時</p>
<p>本月陰濕逾常，大雨時行，南京雨量平均一五六公厘，居全國各月之次席，最多曾達四〇七公厘（一九一五年），上海雨量平均一七六公厘，爲全國各月冠，最多曾達四九二公厘（一八七五年），時屆梅子黄熟，故有「黄梅雨」之稱，雨天十二至十四日，農田芒種，全恃梅兩之潤澤而卜秋收，惟梅雨當令，陰雲常佈，濕度大增，日照銳减，百物生霉，令人不快。本月平均溫度爲二十三至二十四度，最高可至三十八至三十九度，視七月均有遜色，月初：梧桐始花，月中：榴花盛開，月終：蟬鳴高樹，靑山彌望，錄蔭盈野。</p>
<p>七月：布榖始去　荷風徐來</p>
<p>盛夏當令，炎風暑雨，上旬因未出梅，溫度較低，中旬以後，氣溫急升，溽暑開始，月平均溫度均爲二十七度許，爲各月冠，午後極熱之時，南京可達四十三度，（合華氏一〇九度，見於一九三四年）上海亦可達四十二度二（合華氏一〇四度，見於一九三四年）南京雨量（平均一八三公厘）達極高峯，上海雨量（一四五公厘）僅次於上月，雨日十一至十三日，雨多暴陣，時有狂風迅電隨至，東南風頻仍，視界遼闊，他如氣壓最低，日照時間最長，蒸發旺盛，亦均爲本月氣候之特色。是月也，布穀絕見，菱荷花開，靑山蓊鬱，水光山色，極一時之盛。</p>
<p>八月：銀杏初黃　梧同綴實</p>
<p>本月夏威未殺，溽暑依然，惟不似上月之酷耳。京滬月平均溫度，均爲二十七度許，與上月相伯仲，絕對最高四十至四十一度，稍遜上月，南京雨量（一二二公厘）及雨日（十二日）較少於上月，上海雨量（一四二）及雨日（十一日有奇）幾與上月等。本月曇天（十四至十七日）至多，霧日甚少，熱雷雨之多，猶駕乎七月之上，方其至也，風雨晦冥，迅雷急電，悶熱每因以稍舒，裨益衛生非淺。太平洋上之颱風，自上月起已趨繁盛，本月尤頻，且時或登陸，進襲京滬，颱風過境，狂風暴雨爲害雖鉅，然退暑生凉，功亦正未可沒。本月南風當令，草木榮茂，銀杏初黄，梧桐綴實。</p>
<p>九月：桂香榴紅　柿杏始熟</p>
<p>本月歲序入秋，束南風漸匿跡，北風或東北風漸盛，惟風力微和，時多間歇，爲一年中最平靜之時期，上中二旬，炎威雖殺，暑氣稍退，但逐候平均溫度，尙在二十二度以上，下旬金風荐爽，凉意侵人，逐候平均溫度降至二十二度以下，京滬均於二十三日入秋，月平均溫度均爲二十二度八，較上月低四至五度，比下月高五度餘，誠所謂「已凉天氣未寒時」也。標準雨量，南京八十三公厘，上海一二八公厘，雨日十至十二日。是月也，丹桂飄香，柿榴紅熟，銀杏實黄，梧桐落子，寒蟬絕見，鶯遷南國。</p>
<p>十月：籬菊著花　湖蟹正肥</p>
<p>本月序屬仲秋，暑氣已盡，金風徐至，爽適宜人，爲一年中最佳之時節，月平均溫度均在十七度許，低於上月五度半，惟視伸春四月高三至四度，絕對最高達三十二至三十三度，最低零度左右，雨量南京平均四十五公厘（約當四月之半），上海七十一公厘（的當四月三分之二），兩日八至九日，與十一月或十一，十二月同屬稀少者，雨澤旣稀，溫度方降，兼以濕度小而雲量低，日照豐而風力微，登高眺遠，游目聘懷，正其時矣，是月籬菊著花，湖蟹正肥，梁燕南返，鴻雁北來，早霜或偶見於月末。</p>
<p>十一月：霜降楓紅　梧桐葉落</p>
<p>本月晴光頻見，凱風偶至，大氣燥爽，和暖如春，與上月同爲一年中氣候最佳之時，然以蒙古高氣壓雄踞漠北，爲勢甚盛，北風漸厲，大地景象，已漸轉蕭肅，南京月平均溫度十度六，上海十一度三，較上月驟降六度餘，爲逐月溫度變差之最大者，故呼吸器官病，每易流行，雨量準平均，南京四十一公厘，上海五十二公厘，兩日八至九日，雲量之少約同於上月，晴天（九至十日）之多，則冠於全年，是月，京滬分別於二十七日及二十九日入冬，月內霜降楓紅，梧桐葉落，南京早雪曾有見於上旬者。</p>
<p>十二月：草木枯黃</p>
<p>本月行孟冬之令，朔風頻襲，寒氣凌人，嚴霜迭見，瑞雪時降，月平均溫度，南京四度六，上海五度八，最低溫度均可至零下十度以下，寒威之酷，僅决於一月，標準雨量，均爲三十六公厘，爲各月之最少者，降水日數同於上月，晴日八至十一日，陰日（約十日（之多，及日照之少，均爲平年之最，最月，草木枯黄，極目蕭然，月終一候，常雲天漫漫，雨雪霏霏，正所謂瑞雪迎新年也。</p>
<h3>京滬　氣候比較</h3>
<p>京滬雖同居長江下游，相距僅三二〇公里，然上海（拔海七公尺）當長江入海之衝，受海洋調劑較盛，南京（拔海六十八公尺）跟海稍遠，受海洋之影響略微，故二地氣候於大同中，亦多小異之點。</p>
<p>以溫度言：兩地平均溫度雖均在十五度許，南京冬寒夏熱，實甚於上海，南京春夏兩季，各月溫度均較上海高，而秋冬各月均較低，例如七月平均溫度，南京爲二十七度七，上海爲二十七度一；一月南京二度二，上海三度二，再以十度及二十二度爲春秋溫度之上下限，以權兩地之逐候平均溫度，南京春季始於三月十七日，終於五月二十日，期長六十五日，上海以海洋之影響，春來較遲（三月二十七日），春去更晚（六月九日），期長七十五日，夏季南京一二五天，上海少二十天，秋季同始於九月二十三日，南京秋長六十五天，較上海少五天，冬季南京始於十一月二十七日，期長一一〇天，上海十一月二十二日開始，期長一二五天，故南京夏季特長，溫度亦至高，極端最高溫度南京達四十三度，上海祗四十度二，南京最高溫度超出三十五度者，平均有十八天，比上海多四天，日平均溫度超過三十度者有十五天，較上海多十二天，冬季南京雖較上海少半月，而冷度較上海爲劇，上海極端最低溫度爲負十二度一，南京更低至負十三度八，每日平均溫度低於零下者，平均的十二天，多於上海五天，有霜日數南京平均約三十九日，上海的三十二日，雪天南京的十日，上海的七天，每聞南京下雪時，上海降雨，雖不盡然，而南京雪天較多，確爲事實，如民國十四年，南京降雪九日，上海祇二日，民國十八年，南京有二十天見雪，上海僅八日耳，以春秋溫度言，凡大陸性程度淺者，春比秋寒，以兩地四月及十月代表春秋，該兩月溫度，南京爲十四度四比十七度一，上海爲十三度五對十七度四，南京之春較秋寒，遜於上海。</p>
<p>年雨量上海較南京爲豐，已見前述，逐月雨量除四·七兩月外，南京槪較上海稍遜，七月爲南京雨量及雨日最多之月，上海雨量最多在六月，雨日亦然，最少雨量雖均在十二月，惟最少雨日，南京在十月，上海在十二月，全年雷雨，南京（十九天）多於上海（十三天），霧日，南京（七十八日）多於上海（六十六日），前者以冬季居多，後者以春秋爲頻，凡此，均其大較也。</p>
<h3>杭州經濟底內層</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>十四日杭州訊</p>
<p>中國的農曆年關，工商行號都在道時來一個大淸算，「年卅」那一天，討債的要討到翌晨東方發白。所以在農曆年關，最易睦出社會經濟的眞實相來。杭州，有人稱之為現代的都市，但我們在經濟價値上推敲，仍不能逃離農業城市的窩曰；因爲她一切納銷的物產，幾多是農村社會中辛苦的收穫。所以她和農曆年關，更有切膚的關係。，</p>
<p>過年敬神大吃大喝</p>
<p>農業社會中的人，他們對於過年是相當珍視的，過年必須敬神，過年必須大吃大喝幾頓。據說神也要在這個時候來吃喝一頓，所以待神不可侮慢，須購辦年貨來尊敬它。據老杭州說，往年每家南北貨香燭舖門前，總要圍上三四圈人。今年隨便店主人怎樣號召，這些店子的門前，却冷冷淡淡地。在杭州，南北貨號有二百十餘家，在這舊曆年關，本來是南北貨業頭角靜嶸的時候，但因生意淸淡，受高利貸之壓迫而申請閉歇的已有三十二家之多。這倖存的南北運業中，以黄元粉，菉筍，南菜等銷路最大，其他如桂圓，茘枝，魚翅，海參之類都一落千丈，由此我們可以看出購買力的衰微，也可看出社會經濟的上些皮毛相。</p>
<p>茶絲油業　險象漸露</p>
<p>杭州是茶絲的市塲，因爲茶絲外銷一籌莫展，所以茶絲業裏的人，大都憂悶終日。這許多從事茶絲業的人，有的計劃轉業，有的已不願再投資到茶絲業中，而以原有的資金，從事於其他的行當。</p>
<p>食油業也是杭州的一大商業，但因國營油廠普遍發展，商營油行的營業較往年衰落。這些食油的從業者，他們敏感於未來的前途，所以也都相率警戒，如果再受打擊下去，也將有莫大的險象。</p>
<p>購買力弱　外強中乾</p>
<p>百貨業是點級杭州市現我都市的主要裝飾品，它從上海運來了一切玻璃的裝備，又運來了好萊塢的唇膏與指甲油，又運來了最新式的香烟盒和火柴機。在消費上，它確實把杭州市提高到現代化的程度。但是杭州終究是農業的城市，農村中在啼飢號寒，能够買得起享受得起的僅是極少數的少數者，購買力普遍地衰落，百貨業景况於焉外强中乾，僅有少數資力强大者，在很久前囤躉許多貨物，始可勉强獲得一點利益。</p>
<p>捐重利高　商市不振</p>
<p>紗布業在中秋後獲得鉅利，但後來紗價激漲暴落，銷路不振，亦多平平而已。煤油業是依賴外國的貨品來賺中國錢的，它却蒙受着外匯一再調整之利，獲益甚豐，可惜來源有限，發展亦不容易。一般行業，都因爲捐稅過重而利率過高，都在搖搖欲倒的情勢中，和戰前比較，貨物的交換量不及十分之一。</p>
<p>銀錢業中　生氣蓬勃</p>
<p>上述情形，除百貨業，煤油業外，其他都可說是由我們農業社會中生產出來的物品，轉輾到城市社會中來營業的，我們檢討的結果，一般的墜入不景氣的狀態中。在另一面消費的營業者如旅館業，菜館業，汽車業等，都獲得很大利益，呈着蓬勃氣象。國葉業成績也頗良好。但是這種蓬勃的氣象，實在是顯示社會的病態，旅館業發達，顯示房荒問題的懸而不決，菜館業發達，顯示社會整日趨向於交際應酬而不務正當途徑的過程中，汽車業顯示消費者極度提高他的消費慾望，國藥業顯示杭州是個「病」的社會。我們不妨再深一層檢視一下杭州金融界的銀錢業。銀錢業在這一年來，都獲大利，據杭州中華通訊社的報導，最大的純益有五萬萬元之鉅。這就是說杭州的銀錢業還是在蓬勃滋長的途程中。</p>
<p>金融，是社會經濟的血液，血液衰竭，人將枯死，血液健旺，人必健康，依銀錢業獲利這一點觀之，則杭州的血液還健旺，杭州這個單位，或會健康起來，或會進步起來，或會因着「國藥」店生意興隆而得滋補，而在一菜館」中大喝大吃，住在高大的「旅館」內，出入「汽車」，豪華珍貴，愈聚愈富起來。不，這是玄想而已。</p>
<p>生產單位　資金拮据</p>
<p>我們在上述情况的檢視中，看到了本位農產品銷路不振而衰疲，消費營業却步步上進。一個社會沒有消費增加，生產减少，而會繁榮滋長於久遠的。消費增加　生產銳減，而只會使經濟達　衰落的境地。那麼銀錢業的賺錢從何而來呢？是投資到生產的單位上因生產者獲利而獲利的嗎？這是所謂「地下錢莊」做高利貸而獲利的嗎？如果投資到生產的單位上，那麽今天生產單位的資金拮据，呼籲無門，以致借高利貸來維持，到底是什麼馘？</p>
<p>今天生產單位的慘相，他們所要求政府的貸款，有的僅足以還了高利貸的利息，那麽銀錢業是否已大童貸款於生產單位上呢？</p>
<p>金融業確確實實是社會的血液啊！如果這血液凍結在高利貸上，不能新陳代謝，那麽還是要枯寂而死的。</p>

<h3>從「一二八」　想到十九路軍</h3>
<p>在我國戰史上，第十九路軍在蔣委員長的總的領導之下，以「一·二八」戰役一舉成名，寫成了光榮的戰鬥史頁。該軍初爲粤軍第二旅，後改編爲第十師，繼又改編爲第六十一師，再改爲第十一路軍，最後成爲第十九路軍。該軍曾敗吳佩孚，孫傳芳諸部衆，民國二十年九月，更於江西省大破共軍賀龍部隊，總計先後曾經歷四十八决大戰，打了二十七次勝仗，淞滬之戰，即係該軍身歷的第四十八决戰役，士氣之甚，犧牲之烈，各國均爲之震動。後因發</p>

<p>— 周尚</p>
<p>戰時香港僑校，大大小小的近二千，現有三百，近來僑校因不勝環境設備等負担之苦，港九華僑敎育會請求敎育司改善五點，該司曾一一答復，都未解決，這是香港僑校遇着暗礁，過激的份子，倡言僑校撤離港土，現正在交涉中！其中第一第五兩點均爲學校衛生問題，該司强調；「香港現在人烟稠密，已大有妨碍居民之健康，苟對於學校醫藥及衛生設備之規定，復予鬆懈，將必影響及學童之康健，蓋學校之有此規定，純係爲學生與敎師之健康而設想，且處於現今惡劣環境之下，　應嚴厲施行。「又云：「敎室之容量及椅桌之距離等等，均由衛生視學官按照敎育法令而完」云云。</p>
<p>我們對於香港當局重視學校衛生，注意學童健康，甚爲敬佩，　學校衛生與學校衛生敎育，乃有分別。學校衛生是一個老名詞，十多年來，在新大陸已放棄不用，因爲它範圍偏狹，等於監獄衛生，工業衛生，軍隊衛生，社交衛生，口腔衛生，個人衛生和民族衛生。而頂緊要的一點，就是它沒有多大敎育的含義，所以不用學校衛生，而用學校衛生敎靑，學校中光是衛生，猶嫌不够，必須含有敎育意義的衛生，衛生的價値才更高，學校是敎育之地，我們沒有理由從衛生上剔走敎育！</p>
<p>而且，學校衛生敎育是根本的，有許多衛敎重要活動，所費有限，所獲甚大，校方容易舉辦，學校衛生有時費了鉅款，格於環境，也不易辦到，何况戰後滿目凄凉，百事待舉，要修民間疾苦，而說出：「天下飢，何不食肉糜！」所以辦理衛生敎育的朋友們，應該權其輕重緩急，應向易處着眼，大處收效！</p>
<p>學校衛生敎育，是衛生敎育的一部分，實施於學校。衛生敎育，是各種經難忘山的總積，以資改善個人社會和民族健康的習慣態度和知識。在學校裏施行衛生敎育，就長讓兒童在他所有的經騐中，受衛生的敎育，依據兒童從學校中所發生的經騐，不論用任何方法，對於兒童的衛生習慣態度和知識有良好的影響，所以它的範圍，應包括三方面。（一）衛生的學校生活，（二）衛生事務，（三）衛生敎學。</p>
<p>衛生的學校生活，第一是學校環培狀况。拿老式的話講，即是環境衛生。第二是敎師經騐狀况，此指訓育，疲倦，聲音，心理衛生，學習衛生等。第三是學校組織狀况，如作息時間，家庭作業等。衛生事務有關檢査。矯治和預防接種等。衛生，敎學，側重於敎導衛生的生活原理和事實，把衛生知識和實際生活打成一片，指導兒童在學校家庭和社會中，能自己指導獲得健康的生長。</p>
<p>觀乎此，欲謀學童健康，學校應做之事太多，政府應辦之事更多。衛生生活和衛生敎學的大部分，政府應督促學校切實辦理，衛生事務的大部分以及衛生生活衛生敎學的小部分，政府應直接舉辦，派護士，派醫師，送藥物，訓練學校衛生敎育人員，供給衛生敎材，乃至於像英國本國的免費供給淸寒學生的校膳，都應該積極的負起責任，目前這些事情還沒做，偶有做的還沒做好，只要看香港公私立學校兒童沙眼的流行，結核菌素的試騐還沒舉行過，而專求私立的學校負責不易改良的衛生生活的一小部分，並下令嚴格執行，殊屬實解。</p>
<p>英國與中國是同盟國當然並肩作戰的血跡未乾，不至於即有意為難我們的僑民敎育，但是這種措施，應先從輕而易會的方面着手，並希望港政府，依照現代趨勢，改由　敎育的敎育司來主管，認眞領導，先來一批衛生敎育專家去香港切實辦理社會的學校的衛生敎育，此不特學童受惠不淺，即全體市民，亦將感恩不盡了。</p>

<h3>婦女在婚姻上的　三大解放</h3>
<p>— 王新</p>
<p>照目前的情形看來，婦女在婚姻上有三件應解放的事：</p>
<p>（一）婚烟機會均等　一般婚姻的成功，總是男的先追求女的，極少女方先發動的。這樣，有時女子雖然極度心愛着一個男子，可是迫於禮敎的束轉，不敢坦白地說出來，這是大多數女子所感覺苦悶的事。我們必須要澈底，破除這禮敎的束縛，男女互可提出心中的要求。</p>
<p>（二）消滅娶妻必須處女的觀念　中國人的舊腦筋，初夜是一件了不起的事，這確是對婦女的一大侮蔑。我們必須要校正這觀念。並不是說女性不要保持戀愛的純潔，而是女性或因離婚，或因守寡，甚或遇到强暴（如沈崇小姐）等原因當然不復是處女了，可是我們不能因爲她們不幸的命運，而再斷送她們將來的幸福。</p>
<p>（三）切實實行一夫一妻制雖然一夫一妻制，法有明文。但是我們看看社會的情形，大多數的丈夫，一有了錢，第一要解決的問題，便是娶姨太太或另創小公館，有了姨太太小老婆以後，必然的就要虐待本來的髮妻，這是很不合情理的事。妻子和你同甘共苦，難道發達了以後，就該忘記你的妻子嗎？分析這個原因，還是現在道德的低落，忽視戀愛的純潔，僅僅企求肉慾的滿足，爲此，我們必須要從敎育上着手，使每個人都知道戀愛的神聖，認多妻是一件極不名譽的事，那麼這種不合情理的現象，當可逐漸减少。</p>
<h3>一個被忽略了的敎育問題　你願被孩子打駡嗎？</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>你看見過孩子舉了小手打他的爹媽或翹翹小嘴罵他的爹媽嗎？我想一定看見過的。就是我也見過許多。我曾經看見一個五歲的女孩予在許多客人的面前淸脆地打着她爹的耳光，我還看見過一個剛會說話的孩子在他媽的懷抱裏罵爹「糊塗蟲」和「懶鬼」！</p>
<p>看起來似乎是孩子太不懂規矩，其實我們不能怪他們，因爲我們知道摹倣是孩子的天性，允其在他們沒有得到充份的學識去明白地辨明是非的時候。他們的頭腦是無邪的，他們的行動是天眞的，而注意到孩子在生理或心理上發展得是否正常，是父母的責任。</p>
<p>然而在事實上，這重要的責任却往往爲父母因喜愛和疏忽而忽略，他們甚至到了極該予孩子以刻不容緩的糾正的時候，還給孩子一個微笑的讚同。不知這正造成了孩子日後行爲和思想上的一個陰暗不良的後果，那時一定悔之不及！要知道在輕鬆隨便和愉快的家庭日常生活中，太太很可能隨口罵一聲丈夫，雖然有時這罵是含有嗔愛的意義，但給孩子聽到了，却牢記心頭，學了媽的榜樣，罵起爹來了。也許他還根本不懂這罵的意思，他祇是單純地看到媽這樣說爹，爹還笑嘻嘻的，我何不也來一下呢？至於打爹爹，更是常見。有許多媽還握了他們的小手幫他們去打爹。道雖有時也是閨房之樂，可是孩子沒有選擇性，碰到請客宴會之際，他也來罵你一聲「懶鬼」！打你一下耳光，那時你可窘？</p>
<p>同時，你一定會想到平時太縱容孩子了。你不該在孩子打了你一下之後再叫他打一下，不該在被駡了一聲後反去抱他親一個嘴。這一切都是你自己造成的呵因爲你根本誤會了這和孩子親熱的意義，假如你要表示你的愛護的話，你應造成孩子時常和你握手或吻你的習慣，或者親親熱熱地叫你一聲而不是駡你打你！</p>
<p>親愛的爲人父母者，我希望你們的愛能表現得最完美，最神聖，而作爲孩子日後行爲和思想上不滅的火炬，永遠指示着光明</p>
<h3>家事一朿</h3>
<p>— 懿霞</p>
<p>插花法：春季裏花開一半，便用剪刀剪下，即插在一個切好的蘿蔔上，以花盆用土種之，時時澆水，常常見太腸，等花開過後花根也會生好了，這是愛花最好的插花辦法。</p>
<p>補鑊子：鑊子生了洞，祗要去買一塊生猪肝，把它搗爛，然後塗上洞口，此法與鐵補無異，旣省錢又省力。</p>
<p>刀去銹：菜刀切了菜，不拭乾往往要生銹，可把那銹了的刀浸在柑水缸內祇待一二日即可取出，其銹自會除去，如磨過一般。</p>
<p>滌玻瓶：我們吃蛋，往往以殼遺棄，可是廢物也有用途，把蛋殼碎之成片，於是用以滌盪玻璃瓶，不需要剔狹之勞力，而能括垢磨光淸潔明亮。</p>
<p>去米虫：要免除米蛀虫，可用石炭放在紅底下它自會不生。</p>
<p>洗髮：洗髮擦了肥皂非要洗淸不可如不洗淸即有惡味，今可用鈣把它泡成水洗，淸潔而涼爽，還有硼砂也可洗。</p>

<h3>自製「色辣」</h3>
<p>— 靜紋</p>
<p>西菜中的「色辣」，滋味很不差，可是自己來做却不容易，最大的原因就是沒有「色辣油」，所以家庭中很少嚐到，最近筆者遇到一個西菜廚司，據他對我說起，「色辣油」也可以自製，不過比較麻煩些，並且吿訴我調製的訣竅，後來我如法泡製，果然和買來的無分軒輊，何况自己做的東西，總較外面買的來得淸潔價廉呢？現在我就將這法子吿訴給大家：</p>
<p>先買大鷄蛋二枚，須要新鮮，把它敲入碗內，注意仔細地將蛋白設法取出不用，僅存純粹之蛋黃，用力拌和，再用熟油四兩，一滴滴地加入，一面急速用筷攪動，務使蛋黄與油均勻地混合，不可有油浮凝，這樣一面加油，一面打蛋，直到碗裏的蛋黄看上去很厚了，初步的色辣油便調製完成，最得留心的便是加油時候切忌心急，拌時愈快愈好，到第一次加的油完全混和好後，第二次才可再加。不然，蛋油一分離，這一碗東西就算廢物了。</p>
<p>這時候的油是深黄色的，又黏又厚，很難拌開，必須再加一些兒醋，（要純潔的黄醋，鎭江醋不可用）。也是一面調一而加，這時候，油的顏色便漸漸地由深而淺了，最後變成了白色（稍帶黄），便可停止加醋，嚐嚐味兒不可有酸味，不然就是醋加得太多了，色辣油便就大功吿成。</p>
<p>用切碎的熟洋山芋，靑荳，火腿丁，碎臘肉，肫肝等拌和，加好鹹味，便可將「色辣油」加入攪調，或者再倒些蕃茄醬在上面，假使你喜歡吃辣的，不妨加些糊椒末甚至茄辣油等東西，這樣，一大盆色香味俱美的食品，就可以供你一家大嚼一頓了。如果拿來享客，一定也會得人齊聲讚美的。</p>
<p>通常二隻蛋黄和四兩油製成的色辣油足供拌製滿滿二大碗的色辣，如果你家中人少吃不多的話，那末减半的質量也够了。</p>
<h3>態度和印象</h3>
<p>— 支吾</p>
<p>在你剛獲得一個稱心的對方時，切莫立即改變自己已往的態度。因爲他們的接近你，完全由於你給他的第一印象（First　ImPression）不錯，並非是他已整個了解你了。</p>
<p>你切莫爲了找不到對象，而拚命的打扮，交際，放浪……引人注目却不必爲人所愛。</p>
<p>如果你想你的男朋友跟你結婚的話，切莫把自己顯得老於人情世故，什麽事都知道的樣子，把他想吿訴你的話，先說出來；否則即使能結婚，以後也極痛苦的。</p>
<p>交朋友時，別過份壓抑自己，去迎合對方的歡心，除非婚後一直能如此，不然會悔之莫及。許多婚姻的破裂，雙方都說是因爲對方「變了」，其實不是「變了」。是眞性情顯露了。</p>
<h3>玻璃器具</h3>
<p>— 氤氳</p>
<p>玻璃杯器，沸水注入則裂，若杯下預置一薄鐵器使之稍離棹面，則可免，如有茶垢等不潔物，用食鹽擦洗即除，新置時，放冷水中，以鍋用溫火煮之，俟水稍沸，（大沸即破，不可不知），入醋二滴，俟冷取出，可保永不炸裂。（洋燈玻璃罩亦如之）。揩抹穿衣鏡粧鏡等類，若以鷄毛帚後濕布揩拂拭，皆會走光，掛於潮濕處亦然，若用燈草頭或煤油或醋，或報紙擦之，則永可免走光之患，且能異常輝煥。</p>
<h3>新御夫術</h3>
<p>— 馨</p>
<p>婚前之愛情，如吸鐵和繡針，在自然的趨勢下，極緊密的併合在一起。但一旦結了婚，日子一長，大多好似皮球漸漸地洩了氣，磁鐵石漸漸地失了它的吸力一樣，或者雖然表面上似乎仍很親密，但至少雙方本人總覺得有些勉强。不管男的是主吸的磁鐵，或女的是被吸的繡針，旣然已併合在一起，當然希望永遠親密地營共同的生活，結果做丈夫想法如何御妻。做妻子的想怎樣御夫，我們亦得諒解這是要維持雙方愛情之不得已的下策。不過硏究他或她們所經常採取的方式，不外乎綦嚴的管理，嘮叨的囉囌。限制了自由，斷絕了社交，結果，往往造成了更多的不幸。現在一切多講科學，照統計學的計算下來，造成婚後愛情减削，拋棄，蔑視的主動者，有百分之九十强是屬於男人方面，但女子亦不得就卸諉了她的責任，她就應該負不懂御夫的責任和失策。</p>
<p>新御夫術的原理，可以引用極普通的一句古話：『飽暖思淫慾，飢寒起盜心。』一個乞丐，他從來就沒有多娶一個妻子，再迎一位妾的奢望，因爲本人飢餓，尙無法解決，決不容他有向外發展的野心。世界上何論完成任何一件事情，其先決條件就是時間，要是你的丈夫在衣食方面無所顧慮後，那麼他多餘的就是時間，和你長時期的長處在一起，他會開始生厭了；因此他在其他空閒的時間裏，漸漸造成他向外發展的野心，供給他完成不良事情的優美條件。相反的，一個男子整日介爲着衣食奔走，爲着家累勤勞，那麼時間就不允許他去涉及遐想。所以一個已獲得了飽暖的丈夫，決不能再賦與其空暇而閒盪的時間了，我們應該應用神不知鬼不覺的科學的方法，暗暗地剝奪他的閒暇。下面就是幾個最簡單的例子：</p>
<p>（一）以工作奪取時間：即以正當的不妨碍其本來工作的工作來消耗了他的多餘的時間，譬如鼓勵他寫作的練習慫恿他使他對攝影方面發生興趣，使他對繪事方面發生愛好，使他不知不覺中醉心傾倒於道些工作里面，埋首研究，努力練習，結果是可以使他一生空餘的時間，化爲烏有。或者很幸運的，在這些工作里面，開闢了一條新的出路，那是更出乎意外的完美了。</p>
<p>（二）以娛樂奪取時間：或許工作便他煩惱，那麽娛樂是逗人歡喜的，不妨以一架梵華鈴，一座披亞那，甚至一隻口琴亦能消遣他很多空餘的時間。其他如季節旅行，打獵，捕魚，下棋，觀戲等等。不過可別介紹那些對你不利的娛樂給他。</p>
<p>（三）以運動奪取時間：這方法更好了，大多數的男子是自以爲了不起的，聽得有運動，往往願一顯身手，稱雄運動塲而睨視一切，那麼正好使他到健身館去每天消遣幾小時，並且往往在游泳，打球等諸運動後，又可把其他多餘的時間去供給他安靜的休息，對於他的身體及健康也裨益無窮，豈非二全其美。</p>
<p>科學是永遠的在進進，我們的方法當然亦永遠不能停滯在這里。不過須注意，繡針和磁鐵併合得太久太久後，雖然磁鐵會失去它的吸力，但那時繡針上的所生的吸力，亦足够和磁鐵永遠吸住在一起了。</p>

<h3>科長太太</h3>
<p>— 兪浣人</p>
<p>自從科長太太的肚皮膨脹得像大皮球一般以後，她便常常帶着驕矜的臉色，一凸一凸的在街上踱，有時還站在商店門口打哈哈，遇到另外的太太就稀哩嘩喇的談一塲，照例談不到三句半，科長太太唯恐人家沒有看見自己這個「先人而到」的大肚皮，便指着佯怨道：「揹着道個……東西……嘎，眞累死！」</p>
<p>據說科長太太曾爲了肚皮大不起來的緣故，受够了無名氣，科長太太的丈夫——科長，也曾屢次的埋怨她，結婚已有十多年，却連屁都不放一個，就硬要再討小房；科長太太每每綳緊了臉皮，撒嬌似的滾入了科長的懷裏不允許，接着還用纖纖的玉指指着丈夫的鼻子說：「難道這定是我一個人的緣故嗎？」半帶淚的笑了出來，可是背地裏却也不得不　備自己的肚皮不爭氣。</p>
<p>謝謝上帝保佑，終於科長太太的肚皮隨着萬物欣欣向榮的春天漸漸地大了起來，科長太太一改往昔的戚容，更愛嘻嘻哈哈的在街上與另外的太太們打招呼，科長太太的丈夫亦整日價的眉開眼笑得像彌勒佛，現在，夫妻倆速睡夢中也常常會笑了醒來。</p>
<p>科長太太的丈夫是管理一縣的財政的，手裘，腰裏，脚裏有的是花花綠綠的關金和黄澄澄的金條，所以在小核子還未出世以前，就預先購置好了小木床，小浴盆，小椅桌，小玩具，並且特地請來栽縫司務做小蚊帳，小枕套，小棉被，小大衣及各色棉單小衣裳，據說小孩的衣服一共做到五六歲都可穿的呢？另外，當然科長太太臨盆前後所需的一切物品也準備得定定當當，譬如紅糖，鷄蛋，火腿及各種補品囉！……</p>
<p>當那一天太陽上昇喜鵲高呌的時候，我們的科長太太肚痛得死去活來了好幾次，幸虧接產婦是半月以前請來家裏的，所以還沒有攪得手忙脚亂，孩子是順利地生下了地，接產婦報吿說是男的，却樂煞了科長太太的丈夫，忙吩咐在縣政府裏支薪而在科長家裏「服務」的傭工大放爆竹，傭婦大煮麵條，湯圓，科長太太雖在痛楚中也如釋重負般的露出了淡淡的一笑。這時，賀喜送禮的人們眞是車水馬龍似的盈門了。</p>
<p>科長太太的丈夫爲了這一個「大喜」，就在床頭邊的小皮箱內抽出了數疊很厚很厚的寫着一零零零的鈔票來（眞嚇煞了我們一月所入不足溫飽的窮公務員）分別在「三朝」及「滿月」時大張筵席，宴請者大都非官即商，他們一面呑嚼着農盛非凡的酒菜，一面川諂諛的語句向主人賀喜，說這個小孩子面目堂堂，長大起來必定富貴異常，這是上代陰功積德所致；科長太太及科長却春風滿面的道謝：「託福，託各位的………」。</p>
<p>不過，科長太太及科長太太的丈夫在快樂宰福中，還覺得心上擱着一塊石頭，因爲自小孩子出生以來，常常害着病，有時想想不免連冷汗都滲了出來。</p>
<p>幸而寳兒（小孩名）在良醫良藥的診治下，漸漸變得活潑了起來，科長太太因此更比以前胖了，而科長太太的丈夫——當然　——手裏，腰裏，脚裏的關金和金條也就更增多了數目。</p>
<p>如今，科長太太不耐煩再到那個機關裏去做簽到的工作，便爽快的辭職了，却終日心呀，肉呀，肝呀的抱着寳兒在街上驕傲地閒踱着。</p>
<p>不是嗎？你看，科長太太又抱了穿着紅毛錢衫褲的孩子，笑嘻嘻的從那邊踱過來了，後面還跟着一個奶媽呢。</p>

<h3>江南之晨及其他</h3>
<p>— 李文勳</p>
<p>江南之晨</p>
<p>江南的早晨總是淸明的，就是有雨的日子也一樣。最早便聽見車夫拉過車輪的軋軋的滾轉，窗上有了黎明底顫動的曦光，窗外的橘子林裏開始了小鳥底啁啾，唱出黎明底各種優美的曲調。漸漸約有了女人們底脚步聲，　衣聲，洗滌聲，潑水聲，和成羣鴨子底快樂的「鴨鴨」之聲。</p>
<p>我起來站在窗前，呼吸秋天底一種鮮淸的香味，窗前是一條瘦小的活潑的河，那邊是窄狹的，光潔潔的鵝卵石街道。我看見那些女人們在河邊盥洗，用毛巾擦拭着她們原來很潔白的牙齒，又用手捧着一掌永在口裏　嘴；在水裹轉側顧盼她們底秀慧的容貌。一羣鄕下姑娘挑着蔬菜想忽走過，多麼健美的，豐滿的體力，展露了晨光般的微笑。孩子們掛着書包蹦蹦跳跳，大聲的唱着俚歌。賣報紙的，賣油條約，賣各種早點的小阪，呌出單調的呼喚。這種聲音在一定的時刻到來，牠底調子也永遠不變，不但成了孩子們底誘惑，也成了這個鄕城底最正確的時鐘了。</p>
<p>陽光展開了，多麽廣大的，豐富的陽光。</p>
<p>讚美</p>
<p>我底故鄉原來很荒凉，但我第二次回來的時候却有了改變。我住屋的周圍有了一個學校。這個學校剛剛從四川搬來，聽說他們裹面的學生都能吃苦。每天早最看他們爬山，呼吸空氣，練習發音，在陽光普照的野外，用功背誦英文。各種音色，各種調子，宛如早晨林間的鳥語。在一個被他們集體開闢的廣塲上，孩子們快樂的在上面奔跑和朗唱；有些孩子成天躲在圖書館裏抄寫筆記。女孩子在古井旁邊汲水洗滌自己的衣裳，她們蹲在地上，露出健健的腿，嫻熟的手勢是多麽可愛。看見生人便羞澀的垂頭，拉下衣襟遮蓋她們底大腿。每天早晨當我在山徑上散步的時候，總可以看見許多孩子在山間小鹿般的蹤跳，有時笑着舉起雙臂，有時坐在陽光下唱歌；多麽可愛的，可羨慕的靑春。他們把原來破敗的屋宇修築得完整，原來荒蕪的草萊變成了廣塲，原來窒患的地方有了年輕的歌唱，原來愁苦的地方有了靑春的笑，像野生的美麗的花，開滿了我底古老的荒凉的故鄕………</p>
<p>鐘聲</p>
<p>遠處的鐘聲在長嗚着，長鳴着的鐘聲使我沉醉了。</p>
<p>這是我故鄉底一個特徵，聽見聲鐘，就聽見了我底親愛的家鄉，好比在漂泊的路上，看見塔，就有了城市的歸宿了。</p>
<p>這是一個縣立中學底鐘聲，牠包容着我底童軍，我底幼小的抒情，在道鐘聲裏面有眞理，有戀愛，有喜悅，有憂愁。</p>
<p>這種聲音往往又是和陽光，和小小情人底笑聲聯在一起的。</p>
<p>充滿了啓蒙，充滿了一個生命底單調的音節，這是一個童年的音樂，永遠響在我底心裏。</p>
<p>如今那個老門房已經死去，又換了一個年靑的，從鐘聲裏面湧出來的也全是些簇新的，晨曦般的孩子。</p>
<p>當初我所聽見的是快樂，是希望，現在所聽見的却是衰老和惆悵，當初聽見的是出發，現在聽見的像敎堂底晚禱。</p>
<p>鐘聲依然在響着………</p>
<h3>皖南行脚</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>我兩個月前就準備回鄉一行，安葬先靈，總因各事延擱，遲遲不能實行；可是我們故鄕的凌老頭子已經來接我回去。戰後交通，內地很生問題，我決完取道杭州搭民船溯江而上。</p>
<p>「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」我已經整整十個年頭未上人間天堂了。預先買好了二等車票，偕侄兒文鍾，凌老頭三人到了北站。在火車開行一個半鐘頭以前登車，以爲時間很充分，那裏曉得乘客擁擠不堪，我們無法在二等車廂立足，一擠再擠，仍在三等車內做沙汀魚，眞是羣賢畢至，少長咸集，濟濟一堂，來歡度這一個卅五年的大除夕。「旅行」「游歷」，這兩個好聽的名詞，恐怕已經成了歷史上的陳蹟了。戰爭帶給人民的結果，是破瓦頽垣，尸骸枕藉。平蕪千里的錦繡江南，遮上了一層荒凉灰暗的面罩。</p>
<p>我們踏上了木船，各事佈置就緒，動了游興，想去瞻仰道十年久別的西子湖光，來溫習溫習這兩句古詩「欲把西湖比西子，淡妝濃抹總相宜」或許是這殘冬臘月罷，木落湖空，只賸着輕舟幾葉，飄浮在蒼茫萬頃的水上，我總覺得西子是漸漸地衰老了，否則是我個人心境發生了變態，因歲序的推移，自然景物的表現，隨着改變了顏色，但是冬盡春回，循環不已，人生的歲月，是「逝者如斯乎，不舍畫夜」的一去不復返，湖山畢竟是仍舊，人物却全非了，歷史的敎訓是極殘酷的，常我們巡禮岳王廟（岳墳）的時候，發生了無限的感想。</p>
<p>拿游覽本身的價値來講，倘使不受時間的限制，趁坐木船，鼓棹在山淸水秀的富春江上，是極饒詩意的，可是戰後的農村，像一個瘦弱的病夫，精神頽喪，骸骨嶙峋，這「富春江」美麗的名詞，不幸變成一貧寒江」了。兩岸高山，岡稽起伏，有小巫峽之稱，最著名的風景，是嚴子陵釣台，巍然聳峙，氣象萬千，這是發揮東方民族淡薄功利主義的特徵，光輝歷史的事實。</p>
<p>「爲學如逆水行舟，不進則退」我們所坐的木船，搭拖小火輸，逆流而上，駛行尙速，到桐廬後，因水淺灘多，河身狹隘，就恢復應用了千載不變的老法子，集中了九個人的力量來拉船，一步一步很費力的「哀荷哀荷」的前進。這水上的生涯，說來倒也有趣，當着順風的時候，白帆掛起，駛行甚速，胸襟爲之一快；可是船尾廚房，炊烟入艙，刺激眼簾，淚流不止，如喪考妣一樣的令人難過，一到晚上，船夫乘客，擠滿艙內。</p>
<p>我坐的木船，計算男女老幼，超過三十餘人，眞像沙汀魚裝在罐內。勞工神聖的船夫，對於更衣沐浴，實在是無緣接近，集團睡眠，呼吸穢氣，叫人十分難受，萬想不到我們回家以後，貼身的內衣，已成白蝨殖民地了。「在家千日好，出門時時難」眞是一句寫實的名言。</p>
<p>傍晚的時候，我們船泊建德（即舊嚴州府），來了兵丁兩人，偕警士兩名，手拿槍械，聲言上峯密令，要我們改趁其他木船，人貨統統出淸，乘客聽了急得發呆，不知所措，我聲言要見見他們的長官，問明源委，再做道理。他看我身穿藍布大掛，土氣十足，矢口不允，氣燄萬丈，最後我給他身份證看了，說明現在是頒佈憲法，進入憲政時期，人民行動可以自由了，總算不致對牛彈琴，後經警察局長斡旋，脫離了虎口。</p>
<p>船到淳安，改乘公共汽車，內地種種設施，均越常軌，旅客無不頭痛，省公路局車，定價雖低，但車少人多，逢雙開行，商車定價，一無標準，客少減價，客多增値，淳屯路此段到歙只九十公里，公路局車價，由七千元增至九千元，商車自一萬五千至二萬不等，行路之難，可見一斑。沿途各站各村莊，人烟稀少，老百姓蓬首垢面，農村無產可破。</p>
<p>我們世居徽州歙縣城內，是一個荒寒的古郡，居民耐苦儉樸，生活比較簡單，多數經商，求學在外；本地出了兩位學術界特殊的人物，一位是當代哲學家績溪胡適之叧一位是最近逝世歙縣的名敎育家陶行知，他倆幼年求學遊息之地，依然存在，經過九年長期抗戰，敵人的飛機轟炸，改變了許多面目，我踏入家門，令人不寒而慄，後宅已成廢墟，前廳旁無四壁，高樓大廳形成殘寺破廟，可惜缺少了靑磬紅魚，不然我個人就可皈依佛法，出家脩行了。</p>
<p>當地最佳的風景，要算西門的太平橋（又名河西橋）全部靑石造成，建於明代，長的半里，爲十六孔大橋，横亙練江，中外人士，遊覽黄山者，必在此徘徊瞻眺，末端建有太白樓，形勢偉岸，極饒江山之勝，路折爲西千風景區，喬木蔭蔽，古塔　峙，遠望紫陽，披雲，翠微諸峯環峙俯視練江，曲折如帶，下有散月灘，永聲淙淙，邑人許靑岩詩云：</p>
<p>谿岸懸空路幾重，山風披拂碧濛茸；</p>
<p>每懷三伏生秋句，滌硏移舟就石淙。</p>
<p>前行數十伍，境地幽邃，拾級而上，有梅花古衲墓道，兩旁徧植梅花數十本；兼旬後，當於冰肌玉骨中，見其冷豓孤芳之姿，爲名山點綴，再上築有漸江上人墓；漸江僧係一代新安畫手，以細筆工寫黄山，獨標風格，冠絕一時，惜傳世之作甚少，求諸邑人不可得。二十九年六月，洗桐居士，汪采白先生，以疾卒於鄕里，享年五十四歲，聞者痛惜，邑人舉行公葬於此，采翁畫手，筆精墨妙，詩詞淸絕，著有黄海臥遊集行世；國內畫人，激賞其藝。昔年同寓南京，時相過從，當時汪氏執敎中大藝術系，門牆桃李，盛極一時，今一且人天永隔，悵然若失，徘徊基側，不禁觸景傷懷，其下建有碑亭，紀其生平事蹟，並刊「風柳鳴蟬」畫勒石，附七絕一首，書法勁秀可愛，詩云：</p>

<h3>守歲</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>風寒暮晦，常使我想起兒時居故鄉舊家，在陰曆除夕，伴父親守歲的情景。父親班白的髮，蒼老消瘦的臉；身上穿着擁腫的長袍，俯首沉吟在燭台的旁邊。他從不愛對我說什麼辭歲吿誡的話，我靜靜的望着他。時序一年一度的作結，可是這寒微的一家所壓在父親肩上的負累，只有一年一度的加重！</p>
<p>歲月流年，給與他的祗是憂慮與感慨。我知道，他不願把老年所悟的人生的苦汁，澆在他年幼的稚氣單純的孩子心上。只怪流年無情，我現在已感悟到去日父親的况味了；携帶着人生的酸辛，走在憂患的旅途，………</p>
<p>今年，舊家的門楣剝落，風雨暝昧，父親已長離人間。那大廳上的神龕，再沒有他親自書寫的，又經親自每年換上一决的紅紙了，或者現在連那些往年留下的褪色的紙痕，亦已殘缺不存。從前貼着的「滿堂吉慶」，「五世其昌」……的紅紙條，或許曾引起過父親生前的一些由衷的喜悅。然而，現在已沒有人記憶起這些了。我飄流在故鄕千里之外，而今，當母親孤寂守歲的時候，不知又有何感？</p>
<p>守夕待旦，鷄鳴起舞。守歲本能策勵生命的活躍，意志的勃發，正如這句西洋的古話：「暮年禮讚人生，黄昏禮讚白書。」</p>
<p>但是，這種欣慰的生之歡樂的激動，待到什麼時候，我們才能獲得呢？</p>
<h3>詩談</h3>
<p>— 吳吞吳</p>
<p>美，善，及詩的界限，是很難劃分的；因爲她們原是同樣的一種工具，一種促進人類發展及趨向幸福之門約有力工具。</p>
<p>如果有人認爲貪婪者箭頭的鮮血是美，大腹便便者有作用的香弭是善，而淫逸的，怠蕩的娓昔也竟是詩；我們將不惜投以最大的卑視與厭惡。</p>
<h3>送吳兆蘇弟赴美遊學</h3>
<p>— 李拓之</p>
<p>歇浦流光證素心，巴山淸影夢中尋。從今明月天涯照，隔海相望憶更深。</p>
<p>玄武湖邊蘆荻風，六朝顏色淡烟中。遊踪曾過胭脂井，一著溫情便不同。</p>
<p>遠送良朋西更西，崑崙山上呌荒鷄。九洲泛愛無同種，懷抱從教與物齊。</p>
<p>匆匆京滬去來車，幾度經過賣酒家。祖國豪情君記取：江南春暖盡鶯花！</p>
<p>市樓人語繞燈光，莫惜臨歧醉斷腸。座上朋遊皆俊少，是誰神采最飛揚？</p>
<h3>水　桐窗雜憶之二</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>想到水，在中國，大概要數着江南，而且要在太湖那一帶。五湖之一的太湖的水是特別的澄淸。那正是我至今欲歸不得的故鄉，有洒洒落落的風景，富於優柔的情調。稻田，河流，佈滿了四野，被稱爲「魚米之鄕」。那裏的河面都是很寬，水淸見底，水藻和游魚，像在一個大玻璃箱子裏跳動。無窮的船隻在水面上浮過，最有意思的倒不是汽船，而是民船，格外要說的却是漁船。船娘這種女性，有特別的風姿。她們露着臂膊和大腿，是爲了適應生活，而出於自然，並非爲了時髦。她們的皮膚紅黑而健康，尤其是那　黑的險上，美目流波，是動人的嫵媚。她們會搖櫓，撑篙，撒網，做飯，洗衣服，也會唱歌，歌聲妙曼，淸柔而不淫靡，倒是高雅的音樂。最有意思的是，早晨她們坐在船上，對着水來梳頭，看看水裏的影子，以水代鏡，也可以想見這裏的水的淸而且美了</p>
<p>城市的水岸上，排立着漁行，木行，米行，竹行。牆上寫着很大的字號。這因爲船隻是那一帶運輸物品和人們旅行的工具，千萬隻從四鄕搖來的船，裝着人們的食料和用品，在河面上尋找傾銷的大店，這些牆上的大字，就表示那裏面有雄厚的資本，和商業的信用。人看見這麽些大字和這麽些船隻，就可以想見那地方的富庶了。房子和船隻的倒影掛在水中，永面上更浮着無量數的竹筏和木筏，那裏的人在水上結成了市集，可以看見他們在船上，竹筏上，木筏上，交際，唱歌，吵架，喝酒，搬運東西。夏天，有些人蝦蟆般跳下水去，游泳起來了。</p>
<p>誰說威尼斯水都是那麽美，歐洲代古許多Romance的作者，把那裏當作故事的背景而描寫。中國江南這一帶的水鄉，也是値得讚賞的明媚風光，明淸時候的許多「彈詞」，唱本，寫了許多這裏的才子佳人的故事，現在，這一帶說書先生特別的多，他們用一三弦，一把扇子，吸引了許多羣衆。</p>
<p>這裏的人是靠着水生活的，河塘裏沒有水，就沒有魚難，稻田裏沒有水，就沒有米，而這裏的水是那麼淸，所以，道裏的女性，看起來是特別的像一把水葱兒似的了。</p>
<h3>母愛</h3>
<p>— L．Cischia</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>超人</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>迷住全美兒童的連環圖畫</p>
<p>「小讀者們受到了良好的影響：他們知道，正義必張，善良終會克服邪惡！」</p>
<p>隨着形形色色的美國貨，以一拳打崩了「帝國大厦」的「超人」爲主角的連環漫畫，也遠渡重洋，輸入了中國。</p>
<p>「超人」是兩個矮小的童年受挫的克利夫蘭州的靑年的創作品，他倆的名字是，傑利！·西格爾（Jerry　Siae）和喬。謝斯特（Jole　Shguster）。常他們在市學內讀書的時候，常受到鄰近的頑童的毆辱。兩個人都是窮父母的兒子，喜歡看些廉價的中國「水滸」型的小說，嚮往着書中無戰不勝的英雄們。</p>
<p>傑利稍能動動筆，當他發現喬氏有繪圖的天才時，他就夢想到一個「超英雄」。「它」的事蹟可以用漫畫描繪出來。「這個觀念是一天晚上我在床上得的」。傑利回憶說。一個「撤姆生（Samson舊的中的怪力士）希克力士（Hercules希臘神話中的大力士）和阿特拉斯（Atlas希臘神話中負穹蒼之重的巨人）的混合體，再加上加拉哈得爵士的德行，他在生活中的任務是肅淸世界上的暴徒。</p>
<p>超人　來自何處</p>
<p>這兩個靑年人合作了六年，生產出幾里長的「超人」冒險史，漫畫，但是都被編輯先生打了回票，結果，撕了棄之紙簍，第來，在一九三八年的某一天，出版商哈利，多南非爾德首先以一百三十元美金的代價購下第一個「超人」的故事，刋載在「行動漫畫」雜誌上，就此一鳴驚人從此以後，「超人」賺了幾百萬元美金。那兩位三十歲的作者—雖然他們當初已出賣了所有的權利—也繼續分享到贏利。</p>
<p>今天，「超人」是一個巨大的事業。約有三百萬名讀者經常的購買「行動漫畫」，「超人」和「世界最優美的漫畫」這三份雜誌。「超人」的「大本營」就是這三份雜誌，此外尙有二百多份有關聯的報紙加以轉載。它們的總銷數約有二千萬份。以「超人」爲商標的商品已有幾十種。除此之外，還有一個「超人」的廣播節目，由各海岸電台轉播。</p>
<p>當然，「超人」的最大的影響是對於兒重。父母們也知道它的重要性，常會要求「超人」命少年人寫一行字，停止咬他的手指甲。熟衷的小讀者寫信去的更多，「超人」—經過「它」的發行者的紐約寫字間的一羣秘書之手—忠吿少年們每天睡十小時，多吃點蔬菜，並且斷言所有的暴徒都有「黄色的條紋」。</p>
<p>幾年來，西格爾和謝斯特合作的寫着和畫着「超人」。因爲「超人」對兒童的影響實在太大了，所以他們要負起灌輸信仰的任務，一個相似的對父母和敎師的責任感，指導着這漫畫的發行者。於見，他們聘請兒童心理，敎育和福利方面的職業男女，來積極協助。</p>
<p>這個編輯顧問幽，包括比决堡大學的敎授遜司博士，哥倫比亞大學敎育心理部的査台克博士；和陸軍部出版檢査員米立堪中校。這些專家們留意着正確的英文，心理健全的行動和道德。每一個「超人」的故事都經他們校勘過。</p>
<p>最近，査台克博士分析一本平均的「超人雜誌」。他的結論是：「這個雜誌包含一萬個字以上的閱讀的東西。這是一個敎育的源泉，引導兒童到一個廣闊的字彙的天地，包括許多有用的字，這些字在第四級到第八級的兒童，需要更深的敎授，才能學到。」</p>
<p>「超人」對兒童有良好的影響嗎？布里維的心理學研究員班德敎授和兒童學習協會的福蘭克小姐都相信，「超人」有一種明確的良好的影響。</p>
<p>『兒童能够對危險的戰慄享樂，如同成人讀恐怖的小說一樣』，福蘭克小姐說，「他們知道正義必張善良終會克服邪惡。」　　超人　不害善良</p>
<p>爲了證明這一點，她提出一個實例：一個小男孩警吿他的女遊伴說：「當心！我是」超人」，我會傷害妳的。」</p>
<p>「你不能够使我駭怕」，他的對手說，「超人」從不傷害善良的人。」</p>
<p>「超人」使「它」的作者發行者發了財，但是他們也盡了敎育的責任。</p>
<p>我國的「小書」的作者們，不也可以仿效的改善一下作風嗎？兒童敎育家們不也可以利用類似「超人」的工具嗎？</p>
<h3>「世故老人」軼事</h3>
<p>— 殊响</p>
<p>世態人情·形形色色。</p>
<p>（按：「世故老人」曾在本刊發表談片數則，頗多妙語，茲又探得老人軼事二三，仍錄奉讀者。</p>
<p>老人伴要人至某地遊覽。新聞記者突麕集，競詢時局消息不已，要人大窘，老人乃代言曰：「X長此來純爲私人遊覽，並無公務，經此遊覽，覺得中國前途，極可樂觀」。記者笑，老人亦笑，此圍遂解。</p>
<p>某長欲爲母做壽，頗懼物議，老人爲作壽啓曰：「建國伊始，戰爭未已民有飢色，野有餓殍，謹遵慈命，將稱觴應用之資，悉捐作慈善事業，爲災民造福」</p>
<p>老人有友從事公務，頗忠勸，累歲不遷，其同事活動奔走，荒廢職務，竟居其上，友過其居訴不平，老人乃作隱語喩之曰：「昔達摩問觀音大士曰，吾面壁九年，淡無一欲，乃不得昇，呂洞賓三醉岳陽棋，犯酒戒，私度何仙姑，犯色戒，拔劍斬黄龍，犯氣戒，點石成金，犯財戒，乃上列八仙，此是何故。大士笑曰：洞賓朝遊滄海暮崑崙，一日走許多路，足下終日面壁，懶不一動，何故得昇。』友大悟，自此遂日事奔走。</p>
<p>某甲懼內，朋友相聚必嘲辱之，某甲面紅耳赤，愧不能答，老人爲解其圍曰：「他怕他的老婆，不算什麼，如果怕你的老婆，那才是奇怪了。」聞者大笑，某甲如釋重負。</p>
<p>老人至理髮舖理髮畢，出千元作工資，理髮匠嫌少，因笑說曰：「少爺是給二千元的，老爺應當高　點。老人怒曰：「他可以向我要錢，我沒有地方要」。理髮師聞之，揮手令去。</p>
<p>老人携皮箱舖蓋至某縣，中途遇盜，始送以皮箱，盜受之，　索舖蓋。又與之，盜以其迂也，迫其脫外衣，老人笑謂之曰：「君子無所爭，汝何貪心不足耶！盜怒扑之，盡剝其衣去，老人始大恚曰：「甚矣君子之難得也。」</p>
<h3>趁火打刧與混水摸魚</h3>
<p>— 邵甄龢</p>
<p>讀南華經，有這麽兩句話：「入水不濡，入火不熱」當時我想，天地間眞約有這樣一等角色，不就成了「非仙即妖」？實則，這是笨想，笨得連自己都會發笑，笑我自己怎麼會有這樣幼稚的想法！</p>
<p>「善意」一點講，救火會，救生船，就可以代表，凡是做「救火」「救溺」工作的人，都需要「入火不熱，入水不濡」要是這兩種人「怕火逃熱」「怕水避濕」還幹得了什麼，簡直也不成話。以上云云，盡人皆知，不必舉例。</p>
<p>救火。照字面上看，好像只要把火潑熄，便算任務完畢，其實呢，所有罩火罹難的火中人，不論或死或傷，或只剩一口氣，明知道從瓦礫堆中扒出來，也不中用，可是根據「人道」和「良知」，却統統包括在被救之列。救火如此，救溺也該如此。此亦盡人皆知，不必舉例。</p>
<p>此外，「入火不熟，入水不濡」的人物，還有不少，只要再提出兩種，也儘教「以此例彼」。一種是「趁火打刦」，一種是「混水摸魚。」</p>
<p>趁火打刧要不怕火。不逃熱；混水摸魚要不怕水。不避濕。基本精神，是與救火。救溺，並無二致，所差的，只在一些目的而已。</p>
<p>趁火打刧，人不必救，火也不必救，火是給你「趁」的機會，有了這機會，就該隨機應變，不可拘泥一格，要舉例的話，在接連發生的「飛禍」及最近上海「火禍」當中，就可以找得到，聽說有一越，很多難客，還沒有斷氣，還在喔唷！喔唷！然而來「救」的人，要緊的是將金戒子，摸皮夾子，當然你想要的東西，都可以「救！」</p>
<p>至於此次上海「火禍」，則居然以金條爲條件大講「斤頭」。聽說此次火中眞有金條，那麼，其所救者旣爲「黄金」，自不能不在金的頭上轉下念頭。「火中取金」原是件艱鉅的工作啊！</p>

<p>生活雜誌把上述的鉸子陳列一面在時代廣塲某戲院的憇坐室中，在鏡子背後裝上一個崗亭似的小暗室，派攝影記者耶魯喬躱在這暗室中，待機而動。因爲小室是黑暗的，所以耶魯喬儘可安閒地端詳那些對鏡小立的人們，而那些被作弄的人們却除了自己的影子外，一無所見。</p>
<p>當然，正像其他的公共鏡子一樣，耶魯所藏身的那面合金鏡子，很快地就被人們所照顧了，他們有的在鏡子前塗抹口紅；有的端正帽子；有的拉直領帶；有的整理裙子，有的對鏡端詳了半天，嫣然一笑而去，有的則擠眉弄眼，自鳴得意；忙得「鏡中人」的耶魯喬先生，目不暇接，手忙脚亂，他的成績在生活雜誌上發表的計有十七幅，其中：</p>
<p>女七幅：拉正扭轉的裙子的是個二十歲左右的姑娘，她的男友（？）正注視她而笑。一個四十歲模樣的胖太太笑盈盈地拉拉帽子的後邊。二個中年女人似乎都極關心她們的眼睛，一個用手指輕拂着眉毛，另一個則細心地檢騐養眼皮，似乎要確定牠是單的，還是雙的。那抹着口紅的和用舌頭潤濕嘴唇的兩位，表情非常閒逸。最後一位撩想裙子，細心地弄挺她的絲襪。</p>
<p>男十幅：一個擠眉弄目，正在檢査牙床。一個拉曳硬領，看來他頗爲此所苦。這打着鮮豓的領帶的男子，用力拉起他已經不算太低的褲子。二個　眉大眼的紳士，孜孜元元的一個捻着下頷，担心鬍子太長；一個按着鼻子，恐怕瘰子叢生。那個臉像平克勞斯貝的一手執着紙包，一手扶正帽子，嘴角隱含笑意。那醒鼻涕的，揩眼鏡的兩位我眞不明白他們爲何也要站立鏡前。一個俯身繫鞋帶的，也被收入鏡頭。最可笑的要算這位一眼擠緊，一眼大張，兩手拉住大衣的先生了，他走到鏡子前，不過爲要讚美自己；耶魯喬稱呼他　顧影自憐者一（Slif-A　mirer）。</p>

<h3>Hao Pengju Leads Entire Army to Defect; Announces New Position in Haizhou via Public Telegram; Supports the Government and Opposes the Communist Army's Incitement of Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] Hao Pengju's Communist army unit of over 10,000 men, stationed in southeastern Shandong, has, in view of the Communist Party's prolonged military rebellion and the people's unbearable suffering, voluntarily defected to the National Army. Hao himself has assumed the position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and issued a public telegram. According to military observers, Hao's defection will deal a fatal blow to the Communist army that has been causing disturbances in southern Shandong, and the Communist army's collapse in southern Shandong is imminent.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 7th] Hao Pengju issued a telegram from Haizhou announcing his defection, which arrived in Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Xinpu Dispatch of the 27th] Hao Pengju, who calls himself the Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Army, is now leading his unit of over 20,000 men to defect to the highest military authority in Haizhou, due to his dissatisfaction with the Communist Party's disastrous policies that harm the country and oppress the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] Hao Pengju arrived in Haizhou on the morning of the 27th and assumed the position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone appointed by the government. His four divisions are stationed in the areas of Ganyu and its southwest, including Huandunbu and Shahe Town. Hao's actions will have a significant impact on the war situation in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Hao Pengju, the newly appointed Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, arrived in Haizhou on the 27th and was warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians. Hao originally commanded two armies and four divisions, stationed in Ganyu and the southwest. Since Hao assumed his new position appointed by the government, Ganyu has returned to the government's embrace without bloodshed, and from now on, all of northern Jiangsu will be restored.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Hao Pengju issued a public telegram from his defense post, assuming the new position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, appointed by the government. The text reads: Limited to immediate arrival, respectfully addressed to Chiang, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, and all military and political officials, and publicly addressed to Mr. Mao Zedong of Yan'an, all parties and people's organizations across the country: Democratic peace, unity, and unification are the unanimous demands of the people and the consistent policy of the government. The National Assembly has formulated a constitution to be implemented within a time limit to establish a democratic foundation. The government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resume peace talks and discuss the reorganization of the government, exhausting all forbearance for the sake of the country. All citizens should rise up to support it, promote its realization, save the country from danger, rescue the people from misery, and advance towards building a prosperous and strong new China. However, the Chinese Communist Party actually intends to use force as a tool for political struggle, exhausting the people's strength to foster internal strife, which is not only abandoned by the people of the country but also despised by the international community. Pengju leads the entire army and soldiers, always striving for the goals of peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and is willing to return the army to the nation from this day forward, setting an example for the world. I am grateful that the government does not abandon my mediocrity and has appointed Pengju as the Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, and I will assume office at my defense post on January 23rd. In addition to submitting a report, I respectfully inform you, hoping for your public discernment. Hao Pengju, Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Zone and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Army Group, kowtows. January 27th.</p>
<h3>All of Northern Jiangsu Has Been Restored; The Crisis in Jinxiang, Western Shandong, Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 27th] The Communist army under Xu Xiangqian, which advanced from Zaozhuang, southern Shandong, towards the border between Jiangsu and Shandong, sent a force yesterday afternoon to infiltrate the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, attempting to sabotage the railway. After a fierce battle with the National Army's railway protection unit for three hours, they were defeated and retreated. By evening, another Communist army reinforcement arrived and continued to attack the line of armored trains along the Grand Canal, but failed. News this morning indicates that the Grand Canal and armored trains are still held by the National Army. The fighting is currently taking place in villages about twenty li away from the Grand Canal Station, but there is no large-scale battle yet. According to informed sources, Liu Bocheng's forces are still wandering far away in southwestern Shandong, while Xu Xiangqian's forces are appearing in the border area between Jiangsu and Shandong, seeking opportunities to cause disturbances, attempting to contain a portion of the National Army's forces between Xuzhou and Haizhou, so that the Communist army occupying Zaozhuang can have ample time to reorganize and replenish before launching a large-scale attack on the periphery of Xuzhou in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. It is reported that Chen Yi is currently commanding between Tai'erzhuang and Zaozhuang, and a major battle is still pending.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] The crisis in Jinxiang, western Shandong, has been resolved again. There are no traces of the Communist army within five kilometers around the city. Li Wenmi, the brigade commander defending the city, led his troops out of the city on the morning of the 27th to remove the Communist army's siege works. Furthermore, parts of the Communist army's 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns infiltrated towards Chengwu and Cao County on the 25th. More than 10,000 men from the 7th Column launched a fierce attack on the city walls of Shan County on the evening of the 25th and were repelled by the National Army on the 26th. At 4:00 p.m. that day, they returned with reinforcements and are currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army re-entered Pi County at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th, and the garrison in Ganyu has also participated in the National Construction and Unification Movement. From now on, all of northern Jiangsu has been restored, but the Communist army on the front line in southern Shandong is still actively deploying offensives. Chen Yi's main force has gathered in Zaozhuang, and it is recently heard that it has reached seven divisions and one brigade, obviously intending to attack the eastern section of the Longhai Railway again and cause further disaster in northern Jiangsu. Furthermore, Liu Bocheng led his six columns to invade the three counties of Dingtao, Cao County, and Shan County in western Shandong. Now, he is eyeing the Longhai Railway to the south. Last night, the Xiaoba Station west of Shangqiu was briefly damaged by the Communist army, and the National Army is currently expelling them.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch of the 27th] The Communist army in western Shandong is frequently conscripting, intending to attack Jining.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 27th] The Communist army's 4th and 9th Divisions and the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Division, which were entrenched in southern Shandong, previously infiltrated south through Laiwu and Xintai to coordinate with the attack on Tai'erzhuang and Zaozhuang. The National Army then entered Laiwu from Tusi Pass. Now, this Communist army force is returning to that area, and the National Army is still retreating to favorable positions near Tusi Pass. Furthermore, more than 10,000 men from the Communist Shandong Military Region, with more than ten artillery pieces, attacked the National Army north of Chengyang and Shangxiapudong in two routes from the afternoon of the 23rd, attempting to cut off the Jiaoji Railway and invade Qingdao. The defending troops there are strengthening their resistance.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway; Ding County and Xinle Under Heavy Attack; The Communist Army Also Deploys an Offensive Against Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 27th] Due to the renewed tension in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, Mu Tingfang, commander of the 94th Army, returned to Zhuozhou on the morning of the 27th to take command. Sun Lianzhong was originally scheduled to fly to Baoding today or tomorrow, but was unable to do so due to illness.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 27th] The 150 li between Baoding and Shijiazhuang in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, from Ding County to Zhengding, is engulfed in fierce fighting. The Communist army's offensive is no less fierce than the last time: (1) Ding County is still under heavy attack by more than 20,000 Communist troops. The National Army is holding the city firmly, but the train station has fallen, and fifteen train cars and one locomotive have been burned. (2) After Zhaixidian fell to the Communist army, the whereabouts of the railway employees are unknown, and six trains have been completely destroyed. (3) Since the 25th, the county seat of Xinle has been under heavy attack by more than 5,000 Communist troops. Two blockhouses north of the train station were captured by the Communist army yesterday.

<h3>France Should Abide by Treaties to Resolve the Xisha Dispute; No Unilateral Declarations Should Be Made</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 27th] When a reporter asked a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 27th about Foreign Minister Wang's recent statement that the Ministry would issue a formal statement on the Xisha incident, the official said: Foreign Minister Wang recently said at Bishop Yu Bin's cocktail party, "If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to issue a formal statement on this matter, it will be released soon." Our stance on the Xisha issue is that the statements made by Director Ye Gongchao and Ambassador Qian Tai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's spokesperson are not formal. The current priority is how France should understand the geographical and historical evolution of Xisha in a harmonious manner, abide by treaties, and resolve disputes, rather than making any unilateral declarations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 27th] He Lushan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement yesterday refuting France's reasons for claiming sovereignty over the Xisha Islands, namely (1) Vietnam had made claims to the sovereignty of the islands before the war, and China had not issued a statement to oppose them. (2) Foreign ships docking in the Xisha Islands had been robbed, and the Guangdong Provincial Government had not taken any action after receiving protests from foreigners. Regarding the first point, France has never issued a formal communiqué. Regarding the second point, protests should be made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not the Provincial Government, because the Provincial Government is not the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and cannot exercise diplomatic functions. China's claim to sovereignty is based on geography and history.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 27th] It is reported that Foreign Minister Wang met with Chairman Chiang yesterday to report on the situation in the Xisha Islands and seek instructions. Foreign Minister Wang is expected to issue a public statement on this issue soon.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th, United Press] The State Department reported that the Soviet Union's anti-American propaganda in the Far East is primarily responsible for the growing anti-American sentiment in the Far East.

He said that although the Chinese government has banned foreign radio stations, the Soviet Union still has a radio station in Shanghai, calling it "The Voice of the Soviet Union." Kurtwell said: "I have listened to the content of its news programs, which is extremely distorted and often attacks the United States' activities in the United Nations, its occupation policies in Germany and Japan, and its interference in China." Kurtwell said that he recently spoke with an American woman who had returned from Yan'an, and she told him that the anti-American movement there was extremely intense. For twelve days, posters and propaganda were posted and disseminated, attacking the United States. Kurtwell said that the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and the Soviet Union all have news agencies in Shanghai. Although the Soviet agency is not formally organized, and the Soviet Union does not have diplomatic representatives stationed in Shanghai, the work it carries out is the most active. He said that the Soviet Union has six bookstores and publishing companies in Shanghai and publishes four kinds of newspapers. Kurtwell said: Chinese youth are very interested in the United States, but they are also interested in the Soviet Union. They often buy a large number of books. Kurtwell warned US officials that they must strengthen the coordination of news and diplomacy.</p>

<h3>Inspection Group of the Pacification Zone Sets Off in Two Groups on February 1st</h3>
<p>Internal Announcement of Administrative Work in the Pacification Zone</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The inspection group of the Pacification Zone is scheduled to depart in two groups on February 1st, one for North China and one for North Jiangsu, led by Bai Chongxi and Gu Zhenggang, respectively. The North China group will go to areas around Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, while the North Jiangsu group will go to areas around Huaiyin and Xuzhou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior is actively promoting administrative work in the Pacification Zone. Based on the "Guidelines for Governance in the Pacification Zone," it has successively drafted and promulgated "Administrative Implementation Measures for Counties in the Pacification Zone," "Administrative Implementation Measures for Strengthening Counties Surrounding Communist-Occupied Areas," "Key Points for Household Registration in Counties and Cities," "Key Points for Strict Baojia System in Recovered Provinces and Cities," and "Measures for Commanders of All Levels of Troops in the Pacification Zone to Assist in Promoting Local Self-Government" and other regulations for implementation. The purpose is to quickly restore administrative institutions at all levels in the Pacification Zone, strengthen core-level organizations, and carry out various rehabilitation tasks. In recent months, the handling situation can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Urging and preparing for rehabilitation work. The Ministry has repeatedly telegraphed the provincial governments in the Pacification Zone to handle the matter as soon as possible and send government personnel with the troops. As soon as a county is recovered, administrative institutions at all levels will be restored to carry out various rehabilitation tasks. (2) Planning for rehabilitation funds for counties and cities. It has been approved that the funds required for the baojia self-defense organizations in the recovered areas will be paid from the rehabilitation funds allocated to the recovered counties and cities. (3) Recruiting talents from the border areas to participate in administrative work in order to promote national sentiment and strengthen administrative effectiveness. (4) Urging the recovered provinces and cities to complete household registration. Household registration should be carried out first when each recovered county or city government is established or returns, and it should be completed within three months. Currently, it is being carried out in ten provinces and cities, including Fujian, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Taiwan, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Except for the Northeast, most of the remaining provinces are also in the process of completing it. (5) Urging the recovered provinces to strictly implement the baojia organization. According to reports from the recovered areas, most counties and cities have earnestly implemented the measures promulgated by the Ministry, and the baojia organization and personnel are more sound than before. (6) Improving administrative organizations at all levels in the Pacification Zone. Five principles have been established and handed over for earnest implementation: 1. Simplify the organization, improve administrative efficiency, and reduce irrelevant government orders. 2. Replenish county-level funds. If there is a shortage, apply to the Central Government for special allocations, and strictly prohibit apportionment. 3. Select capable comrades with rich experience and strong ability to serve as county magistrates and assistant administrative personnel. 4. Improve the treatment of administrative personnel at all levels below the county level. 5. Severely punish corrupt and derelict personnel, and reward the people for reporting grievances and informing secrets. (7) Organize and improve county and city-level public opinion organs. It is stipulated that in recovered counties and cities, public opinion organs in townships and baojia should be established immediately after recovery, as well as temporary county and city councils, and formal county and city councils should be established within six months. Most of them have been established successively. (8) Strengthen public security forces, establish provincial police departments, strengthen police forces, plan for the reorganization of police brigades, and review the organization of people's self-defense forces in provinces, cities, and counties. (9) Guiding engineering rehabilitation. Over the past year, the Ministry has urged provinces to establish public works teams to assist various cities and towns in carrying out emergency implementation and rehabilitation work, and urged counties and cities to first formulate construction plans and then implement them step by step. At the same time, the Ministry has appointed senior technical personnel to lead foreign experts to conduct inspections in major cities and assist in design. Except for a few places where implementation has not been possible due to special circumstances, most are actively handling it. (10) Stepping up the work of opium suppression. Personnel have been dispatched to supervise the opium suppression policy, strictly order registration for abstinence, strictly investigate and crack down, and strengthen the assessment of the opium suppression policy. However, a review of the administrative work in the recovered counties and cities reveals that there are still many difficulties, and some have failed to achieve the planned goals. The main reasons are that local governments have failed to formulate central tasks and implement them with varying degrees of urgency, the shortage of funds, insufficient coordination among local military agencies, too many levels of administrative agencies at all levels, and a large number of grassroots workers, making assessment difficult.</p>

<h3>Government Hopes to Reorganize Soon, May Become a Reality by Mid-Next Month, Lei Zhen Meets with Representatives of Various Parties Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The issue of reorganizing the government is still under deliberation these days. It is heard that, in principle, what the various parties hope for is a comprehensive reorganization, that is, the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the hospitals, and the National Government at the same time. The Youth Party has made rigid demands on the distribution of personnel, hoping to occupy one-third of the positions in various departments, from the central government to the local governments. The Social Democratic Party has not yet made any specific statements. It is also heard that the various parties have no intention of participating in technical departments. At present, the government is still considering the principles, and has not yet discussed the details. However, the government has the sincerity to implement the reorganization as soon as possible, so it will make active efforts recently. Last night, on the 27th, this reporter interviewed Hong Lanyou, who said that the reorganization of the government may achieve some results before March 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Last night, this reporter interviewed Secretary-General Lei Zhen to inquire about his views on the overall situation. He replied that the top priority for solving the current problems is peace talks. However, since the government put forward its plan, the CCP has not yet given a formal response. The government can only temporarily shelve the resumption of peace talks, but does not intend to take other actions during this period. When asked whether the Democratic League could act as an appropriate intermediary for the resumption of peace talks, he replied that the Democratic League has not expressed any opinion on this matter. As far as the government is concerned, it has never refused such efforts. His current visit to Shanghai is entirely to pay New Year's greetings to old friends and does not involve any activities, but it is also possible to contact people from the Democratic League. When discussing the prerequisites for various parties to reorganize the government, he said that the reorganization of the government should start from the central government first, and the local scope is too broad and should be carried out gradually. As for the personnel issues of the government's side in the reorganization of the government, the various parties need to consult with the Chairman. Lei visited Wan Renqian of the Social Democratic Party yesterday and is scheduled to visit personnel from the Youth Party and the Democratic League today (28th).</p>
<p>[Our City News] Secretary-General Chen Qitian of the Youth Party told reporters yesterday that the Youth Party is still carefully considering the issue of participating in the government. The rumors that the government has promised the Youth Party certain departments and that the Youth Party has made more demands are purely unfounded. The Youth Party hopes that its participation in the government will be truly beneficial to the implementation of party and government affairs. Therefore, it is currently conducting in-depth research on the policies, systems, and lineup after the reorganization of the government. Before the reorganization of the government, the Youth Party must not only reach an understanding with the government on the aforementioned issues, but also seek understanding with other parties participating in the government. Therefore, the reorganization of the government cannot be achieved overnight. Current contacts are still preliminary consultations. Chen also said that he, Li Huang, and Zuo Shunsheng are scheduled to meet with Dang Zhen this morning (28th).</p>
<h3>Lu Dingyi Officially Declares, CCP Insists on Two Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] On the 25th, Lu Dingyi, Minister of Propaganda of the CCP, issued a lengthy official statement in response to the statement made by Minister Peng Xuepei on the 20th, still insisting on the two conditions of abolishing the National Assembly Constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th of last year, and believing that this is the "most lenient" and "minimum" condition. If it cannot be achieved, "sending government personnel to Yan'an, or even holding a round table conference," is unnecessary. It also stated that since the government has rejected the two conditions proposed by the Communist Party, the government should bear all the consequences. When explaining the "leniency" of these two conditions, Lu said that the Communist Party should have demanded that the government "punish the warmongers" and "the reactionary elements who destroyed the Political Consultative Conference," and the person in charge of signing the Sino-U.S. commercial treaty, and compensate the people for the losses suffered due to the civil war; however, the Communist Party has abandoned these demands and only proposed to abolish the Constitution and restore the military position of January 13th of last year, which can be said to be "lenient," and so on. The full text is more than two thousand words long.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] After Lu Dingyi issued a statement rejecting peace talks, observers believe that the reason for his insistence on the two preconditions is to delay time and wait for the changes in the situation of the Moscow Conference in March. We cannot determine what the Soviet Union's attitude will be, but our government has gradually become a democratic government, and all countries will surely help us enter a peaceful and democratic environment. The Communist Party's current wait-and-see attitude may have already doomed it to failure.</p>
<h3>Social Democratic Party's Stance on the Current Situation to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Social Democratic Party will announce its stance on the current situation in the near future, and will provide concrete measures for various practical issues in politics, military affairs, economy, and diplomacy as an indirect response to the government's invitation to the party to participate. Most of the standing committee members of the Social Democratic Party believe that participating in the government at this time will not help the overall situation and advocate adopting a reserved attitude. If government representatives invite them again, the party will likely propose two prerequisites: (1) Please the government announce new policies on politics, economy, and military affairs, with special emphasis on guaranteeing freedom and stability of democracy; (2) Please the government submit a list of government personnel after the reorganization of the government, so as to study whether it can be coordinated with the new policies. Only after these two points are resolved smoothly can participation in the government be considered. As for the rumors that participation in the government will be based on individual volunteers, a senior official of the Social Democratic Party told reporters that if this happens, the participants will participate entirely in their personal capacity and have nothing to do with the party, and please make a public statement on this point.</p>
<h3>Beijing Peace Daily Publishes an Article Criticizing the Democratic League's Political Report</h3>
<p>Accusing it of Colluding with the Communist Party to Harm the Country</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Nanjing Peace Daily published an editorial on the 27th, criticizing the political report of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League. Its conclusion is: The long "political report" published by the Democratic League can be summarized into two sentences: "The Communist Party has a hundred rights and not a single wrong, while the Kuomintang has a hundred wrongs and not a single right." The article clearly pointed out: The long report of the Democratic League is a confession of colluding with the Communist Party to stir up internal strife and harm the country and the people, and cited several facts as evidence. The Communist Party prevented the National Army from going to the Northeast to accept sovereignty, and the Democratic League also opposed the government's acceptance of sovereignty; the Communist Party used unmentionable means in the Northeast to create a so-called "Democratic Allied Army" and occupied many cities, and the Democratic League strongly urged the government to "recognize reality"; the Communist Party hoped to complicate the Northeast issue and turn it into an international issue, and the Democratic League regarded the Northeast issue as "a focus of international issues"; the Communist Party refused to participate in the National Assembly and refused to accept the Constitution, and the Democratic League also refused to participate in the National Assembly and refused to accept the Constitution.</p>
<h3>Heavy Snow in Baoding for Six Days, Creating Rare Extreme Cold</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 27th Dispatch] Baoding spent the entire Spring Festival this year in snow. Starting from New Year's Eve, it snowed for a total of six days, and it only cleared up on the 26th. The snow on the streets has not melted, and the temperature has dropped to minus seventeen degrees Celsius, which is an unprecedented extreme cold. Wang Chonghui Collects Opinions from All Parties</p>
<h3>Preliminary Draft of Regulations Concerning the Implementation of the Constitution Completed</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui Solicits Opinions from All Parties</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The various regulations related to the implementation of the Constitution, such as the Election Law, are drafted by Wang Chonghui and handled jointly with Hong Lanyou and others. It is reported that the preliminary draft has been largely completed, but the important principles still need to be solicited from all parties. Wang convened a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council at 3:00 p.m. on the 27th to exchange opinions. Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Lifu, Hong Lanyou, Liu Keshu, Lu Xiaodao and others attended, and they discussed the key points extensively, but no concrete decisions were made. It is planned to hold another meeting in early next month to study the matter and then send it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. Hong said that the election laws of various countries are based on party distribution, some use security deposits, and some use qualifications, but we cannot choose arbitrarily in our country. We hope to draft the most advanced new law, but we cannot but make plans for reality. Therefore, in the drafting stage, it is very difficult to favor one over the other. However, in response to the needs of the facts, the drafting of various regulations will be completed as soon as possible so that they can be announced within the expected time.</p>
<h3>Paper Mills in Taichung and Tainan Complete Rehabilitation and Proceed with Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tainan, 27th Dispatch] The rehabilitation project of the Xinying Pulp Mill in this county, which was bombed fourteen times during the war, has been largely completed. It is expected that production can begin in early March when raw materials are sufficient. The factory has a large scale of equipment and strong machine capacity. Using bagasse, it can produce an average of 100 tons of pulp per day. In the past, the annual output was more than 30,000 tons, making it one of the largest pulp mills in Taiwan Province. Plant managers Tan Gao and Yongxiang said that the factory has not yet resumed production. In the pulp mill, only old bagasse is first used to manufacture bagasse boards for construction, producing 1,000 sheets per day. As for the main raw materials for pulp, there are three types: bagasse, sawdust, and bamboo chips. Among them, the quality of bagasse products is better, but at present, there is a shortage of this raw material in the province, and it cannot be supplied in large quantities. Therefore, it is planned to use sawdust and bamboo chips to manufacture pulp in the near future, and the goal is to reach more than 3,000 tons within the year. According to the paper industry factories in Taiwan Province, the larger ones are only the Luodong Paper Mill in the north, the Tiandu Paper Mill in Taichung, and the Xinying Pulp Mill in Tainan. The former two are specialized in paper making and do not make pulp, while the latter can both produce and manufacture. [Central News Agency, Taichung, 27th Dispatch] The Taichung Paper Mill, jointly run by the Resources Commission and the Provincial Government, was bombed several times during the war, causing great losses. The various repair projects have now been largely completed. According to plant manager Wu Zuping, since the factory started operations in May last year, the output has increased from one ton per day to seven tons per day. There are currently more than 600 employees. It is expected that the daily output will increase to 15 tons by August this year. The Daolin paper produced is of excellent quality and currently uses bamboo as a raw material. The factory site is located in Dadu Township, Taichung County, which is located in the bamboo center area of Zhushan and Zhunan in the province. Transportation in both places is very convenient, and the existing raw materials can be used for one year.</p>
<h3>Tainan Sugar Factory Officially Resumes Production</h3>
<p>Can Produce 180 Tons per Day</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tainan, 27th Dispatch] The Cheluzhai Sugar Factory in Tainan County, the only factory in Taiwan that produces cube sugar, officially resumed production today, using sugar cane to manufacture sugar, including 36,000 tons of sugar cane reserves from the Haili and Sanqiandian sugar factories, which will all be crushed and processed into sugar. According to the person in charge of the factory, the production capacity is very strong; on average, 180 tons of sugar can be produced per day. From the 36,000 tons of sugar cane, it is estimated that 13,100 tons of special-grade sugar and 300 tons of red sand sugar can be produced.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Smuggling of Rice to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th Dispatch] The Taiwan Provincial Government recently ordered the police and shipping agencies, as well as the county and city governments, to strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from smuggling rice to Japan. Although Taiwan and Japan have not yet resumed trade, it is reported that there are often some profit-seeking merchants who smuggle rice and white sugar to Japan. Taiwan Island is surrounded by the sea, and there are many ports of all sizes. Fishing boats of 30 to 50 tons can easily escape the eyes and ears of customs and other anti-smuggling personnel when entering and leaving the ports. In the past, Japan's required sugar and rice were mostly supplied by Taiwan. Currently, Japan is short of both rice and sugar, and smugglers make huge profits. However, rice prices in Taiwan Province are also soaring. The Provincial Government ordered a strict ban on private exports in order to retain rice and stabilize grain prices. The Provincial Government also reissued an order today to prohibit the use of one of the main miscellaneous grains, sweet potato flour, from January to March, so as not to affect commodity prices.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Railway Equipment Shipped to China Via Hong Kong One After Another Originally a Military Railway from Iran to the Soviet Union Disassembled by UNRRA and Provided to the Yuehan Railway</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The military railway from Iran to the Soviet Union during the war has been dismantled by UNRRA and shipped to China. A large amount of railway equipment, including locomotives, rails, carriages, and freight cars, has been continuously arriving in Hong Kong and allocated by the CNRRA to the Yuehan Railway for use in restoring the railway's pre-war efficiency. Assuming all the railway vehicles that have been shipped are arranged in a single line, they can form a line eight miles long. A large number of equipment is being reassembled in Hong Kong by the CNRRA. Currently, 1,200 freight cars of 20 to 50 tons and 10 locomotives have been assembled. Hundreds of freight cars have been allocated to the Yuehan Railway for operation. If all are operated, the total load capacity can reach 40,000 tons.</p>
<p>Although the vehicles and equipment have been used during the war, most of them are still in good condition and do not hinder their use. The assembly plant in Kowloon is currently extremely busy, but due to the lack of tools, some work has to be done directly by hand, but still six or seven units can be assembled every day. According to an expert from the CNRRA, the world is short of railway vehicles and equipment after World War II. If we had not dismantled the Iranian railway and directly supplied it to us for use, we would have to wait two years for delivery even if we ordered from Britain and the United States. The Iranian railway equipment that has been shipped includes 45,000 steel rails and 250,000 sleepers, which is really rare," he said.</p>
<h3>Far East Regional Conference to be Held in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Canadian Representative Will Also Attend</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The first meeting of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee for this year will be held at the Bank of China at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow (29th), chaired by Dr. Yan Huiqing. The Canadian representative will also attend for the first time. The Canadian representative's participation in the meeting was nominated by Deputy Director Shan Min of the CNRRA at the Sixth General Assembly of the UNRRA in Washington. Li strongly argued that the Canadian representative should also be qualified to attend, because Canada has made great contributions to relief in China, and the total amount of its donated materials reached US$138,738,739, second only to the United States and the United Kingdom. The Canadian representative attending this time is Campbell, who is 29 years old and a naval officer. He came to China a year ago and served as the representative of the Canadian Foreign Affairs Office in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The agenda of this Far East Regional Conference will include Mr. Li Shanmin's report on the proceedings of the UNRRA General Assembly in Washington, reports from responsible representatives on the handling of the resettlement of overseas Chinese, the Yellow River management project, relief in the Yellow River flood area, and the CNRRA's supply of materials, equipment, and economic issues.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Agency in China to End at the End of March</h3>
<p>CNRRA's Work Will be Extended</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The CNRRA authorities believe that the liaison agency in China will end at the end of March, but 50% of UNRRA materials still need to be shipped to China, so the work of the CNRRA will be extended and may not be able to end at that time. However, with regard to the agency's business, a partial transfer is being planned, and at the same time, relief supplies are being distributed as quickly as possible. The transfer work will be carried out step by step according to a systematic plan. Currently, the equipment that has been transferred includes several ships of the CNRRA Water Transport Brigade, which were transferred to the China Shipping Industry Joint Operation Office. In addition, the ship drivers, mechanics, management and other technical personnel were also hired by the office at the same time, but the treatment issues of some foreign personnel have not been fully resolved. It is reported that the foreign personnel requested the office to pay according to the UNRRA treatment, but the office authorities are currently unable to agree.</p>

<h3>Zhou Fohai's Escape from Death Blocked; Wife's Request for Retrial Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Following the upheld death sentence in Zhou Fohai's appeal, his wife, Yang Shuhui, had previously submitted a petition to the Capital High Court requesting a retrial. President Zhao Chen of the court assigned the case to the Second Criminal Division for handling. After several reviews by Division Chief Zheng Lie'e and judges Wang Hongquan and Liu Xiancai, the division decided in a meeting on the afternoon of the 27th to reject the request with a Special Criminal Ruling No. 2 in the 36th year of the Republic. The main text of the ruling stated: "The request for a retrial is rejected."</p>
<p>Minor Merits Cannot Cover Great Faults; Small Favors Cannot Obscure Enormous Crimes</p>
<p>The reasoning began by stating that Ms. Yang based her request on Article 28, Section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, arguing that Peng Shou and Cheng Kexiang had not testified during the trial. She also cited Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitors, claiming that Zhou Fohai's actions "beneficial to the war of resistance" after his "surrender" should warrant a retrial and reduced sentence. "However, the investigation reveals that the defendant Zhou Fohai conspired with the enemy to resist our country. On November 4th of the 28th year of the Republic, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court had already issued an explicit arrest warrant. The defendant's so-called 'surrender' occurred in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic. Regardless of whether the Military Intelligence Bureau acknowledges the matter, even if it were true, it occurred after the fact of discovery and the explicit issuance of an arrest warrant, thus not meeting the conditions for surrender. How can this be used as a reason for requesting a retrial? Furthermore, Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitors stipulates that if a traitor has assisted in the war of resistance or performed acts beneficial to the people, and the evidence is conclusive, their sentence may be reduced. However, this regulation adopts the principle of 'may be reduced,' not 'must be reduced.' Even if the conditions stipulated in that article are met, the court still has the discretion to decide whether or not to reduce the sentence based on the severity of the crime." The ruling then detailed Zhou's traitorous acts, stating, "In summary, his crimes are extremely grave." Regarding his "minor merits," "Minor merits cannot cover great faults, and small favors cannot obscure enormous crimes. After weighing the circumstances and considering the severity, it is determined that it is difficult to grant a 'reduction' according to Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitors. Nothing short of the death penalty will suffice to serve as a clear warning. Therefore, even if the witnesses Peng Shou and Cheng Kexiang are brought forward to prove that the defendant assisted in the war of resistance or rescued Central personnel, it cannot be said that this is important evidence sufficient to affect the original judgment, nor can it be said that the original judgment failed to consider the aforementioned witnesses or that there was any significant error. Moreover, the defendant Zhou Fohai was the chief culprit of treason, and his actions were nothing more than attempts to subvert the government. In summary, his crimes warrant more than just death... Therefore, this request for a retrial does not meet the conditions stipulated in the aforementioned article. The applicant's request for a retrial based on the aforementioned article is without merit."</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, it was ruled, in accordance with Article 1, Section 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 427, Section 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that the ruling should be as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>The end of the ruling included the following: "If you do not agree with this ruling, a protest must be submitted to this court within five days after the delivery, and the protest shall be made to the Supreme Court." This ruling will be delivered to Zhou's wife on the 28th.</p>
<p>Capital Residents Pay Attention; News of Zhou's Execution</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] After the Capital High Court rejected Zhou Fohai's request for a retrial in the afternoon of the 27th, Minister Xie Guansheng met with President Zhao Chen of the Capital High Court at 5:00 PM to inquire about the case. Zhao reported that the request had been rejected and Zhou's wife had been notified that she could file a protest. Minister Xie immediately stated: Zhou's case is significant, and it must be handled with care in accordance with the law to demonstrate impartiality and maintain judicial dignity.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Capital residents are anxiously awaiting news of Zhou Fohai's execution. However, considering the examples of past executions of traitors such as Lin Mei, executions often occurred after the Supreme Court rejected the protest and before a second request for a retrial was made. Zhou Rong is considered a "favored traitor," and his "contributions" are actually greater than his crimes compared to Lin Mei. How can the judicial authorities treat him the same? Minister Xie Guansheng has stated that the execution order has not yet been issued, and Zhou may be able to delay his fate for a few more days. However, the general consensus is that Zhou's crimes are heinous and that he should be executed swiftly to uphold justice.</p>

<h3>Editorial: New Prospects for British-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>As a result of Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow, the uneasy British-Soviet relations of the past year have shown a new light. During the war, Britain and the Soviet Union were allies, but it is well known that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union after the war has not been harmonious. Although Attlee's administration chanted the slogan of turning to the left, it has not achieved any improvement in British-Soviet relations in practice. Britain has a traditional fear of the Soviet Union, coupled with the expansion of Soviet power in Europe after the war, which conflicts with Britain's traditional interests in many ways. This is manifested in the political situation in Greece, in the handling of the Turkish Straits issue, and in the issue of German control. As for Britain's withdrawal from Poland, it has made this World War lose its original meaning. The Soviet Union also had a traditional jealousy of Western Europe, coupled with the close relationship between Britain and the United States, the military negotiations between Britain and the United States, the adoption of military standardization, military exercises in the Arctic, and the possession of atomic energy secrets. Even if the Soviet Union does not consider this hostility, it feels uneasy in its heart. Therefore, the British-Soviet relationship has been in this state of neither close nor distant for the past year. During this period, although there was Professor Laski, the leader of the British Labor Party, visiting the Soviet Union last July, and the cultural delegation led by the famous novelist Priestley, they did not help to improve British-Soviet relations in substance.</p>
<p>More recently, Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy speech on December 22 further provoked criticism from the Moscow Pravda, which in turn deteriorated British-Soviet relations. Pravda believed that Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement that Britain's foreign policy was not colluding with the United States, nor was it inextricably linked to any country, indicated that Britain had disregarded the Soviet alliance treaty. Although the British Foreign Office denied this statement, it failed to reduce the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain. Therefore, at this time, we saw the visit of Field Marshal Montgomery, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff of Britain, to Britain. Although Field Marshal Montgomery was only fulfilling a previous invitation, undoubtedly, Field Marshal Montgomery's trip was another trump card for the British government to try to improve British-Soviet relations. However, despite the visit of such a figure as Field Marshal Montgomery to the Soviet Union, it failed to dispel the Soviet Union's doubts about Britain. According to a Reuters dispatch, at the farewell banquet in the Kremlin, Stalin asked Montgomery how the opportunity to sign a British-Soviet military alliance was. Montgomery pondered for a moment and replied: Hasn't Britain and the Soviet Union already signed a military alliance? Stalin replied: I am referring to a real alliance, not the Bevin alliance. This shows that even the Soviet head of state had the same view as Pravda regarding Bevin's previous statement. This misunderstanding was not clarified until the British Foreign Office released the exchange of telegrams between Bevin and Stalin on the 25th of this month. The two sides not only reaffirmed that the 1942 British-Soviet alliance treaty remained in effect, but Stalin also expressed his willingness to strengthen the alliance relationship and advocated deleting various reservation clauses that could weaken the previous alliance treaty. Due to the public announcement of this exchange of letters, the two countries reaffirmed the validity of the alliance treaty, which suddenly opened up a vast new situation for British-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>What deserves our attention is: What kind of new developments may British-Soviet relations have? There are basic conflicts in national policies between Britain and the Soviet Union, coupled with the traditional fear and contempt for the Soviet Union in Britain, and the traditional doubts about Western Europe in the Soviet Union. These traditional prejudices do not change due to changes in the ruling party. The policies adopted by the Labor government are no different from those of the Conservative government led by Churchill, and the Soviet socialist government of the proletarian dictatorship is no different from the autocratic government of the Tsarist era. However, after the Second World War, Britain was exhausted, and its strength was far less than before. Even if the Soviet Union was devastated by the war, and even if the new five-year plan was implemented, its strength was not as good as before. Moreover, Britain and the United States kept the secrets of atomic energy, and the Soviet Union was slower than Britain in the production of new weapons. Therefore, at this time, both sides have the intention not to start a war lightly.</p>
<p>However, despite this new expression of rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union, the development of new British-Soviet relations must be sought from a larger perspective in order to see its signs. Now that Stalin has requested to delete those reservation clauses that are sufficient to weaken the British-Soviet alliance treaty; in fact, the British-Soviet alliance treaty was signed when the fight against Hitler was in full swing. Now times have changed, and the emotions when the alliance was originally signed may not be the same as today. Moreover, there is now the organization of the United Nations mechanism to ensure the effort for lasting world peace. Therefore, the key to the development of new British-Soviet relations seems to be not only related to Britain and the Soviet Union, but also involves other aspects besides Britain and the Soviet Union. This is why we saw the London Times, which represents the British government, making such a statement: "An unfortunate misunderstanding has led to a fortunate result. The next step to promote British-Soviet relations will be sought at the Moscow Conference in March." From this, it can be seen that Britain still expects the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference for the development of new British-Soviet relations, and on the eve of the opening of this Foreign Ministers' Conference, US-Soviet relations have not improved due to the change of US Secretary of State. On the contrary, US State Department officials accused the Soviet propaganda machine of trying to turn the people of Eastern Europe and China against the United States at this time, which seemed to cast a new shadow on US-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>However, the new US Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall, is a military diplomat with outstanding talents, and also a person who can gain the trust and support of the Soviet Union. Marshal Marshall's year-long stay in China enabled him to estimate the Soviet Union from a new perspective. Now that Marshal Marshall will attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow as the US Secretary of State; at a time when British-Soviet relations are improving, the summoning of this Foreign Ministers' Conference may not only be enough to promote British-Soviet relations, but may also promote a new understanding between the three powers of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. The development of new British-Soviet relations must have its meaning on a more solid foundation. We only hope that this new understanding can be born, so that lasting world peace after the war can be ensured.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Government Issues Order to Ban Gambling; Public School Personnel Sign Anti-Gambling Covenant; Promote Legitimate Entertainment and Conscientiously Promote the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang News] The evil customs of smoking and gambling have not been eliminated in Jiangxi.

<h3>Instructions from the Zhejiang Provincial Military Control Zone on Key Points of This Year's Conscription; Age of Conscripts Tentatively Set at 20 to 35 Years Old</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing News] The county government received a telegram yesterday from the Provincial Military Control Zone Command, stating that the conscription work for the 35th year of the Republic has ended, and the various procedures for the conscription of soldiers for the 36th year of the Republic should be started immediately.

(3) Before the central government stipulates the age for conscription, it shall tentatively be based on those who are 20 years old (born in the 15th year of the Republic) to 35 years old (born in the 1st year of the Republic), and the lottery shall be conducted indirectly by age group.</p>
<h3>The Suzhou Newspaper Business is in Recession</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 27th] Just after the Lunar New Year, a wave of closures has hit the newspaper industry here. As of now, the small-scale Dahua News, Suzhou News and Commerce News have all ceased publication one after another. The Dajiangnan News and Lixing Daily have announced temporary suspension on the grounds of expanding their coverage.

<h3>Urgent Collection of Suzhou Land Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 27th] This county's land tax quota is the richest in Jiangsu Province, enough to抵抵抵 the entire province of Guizhou, so it is not only relied upon to supplement the provincial treasury, but also borrowed to supplement the national treasury, which can be said to be related to the entire financial situation, and the central government attaches great importance to it. However, since the collection began, the number of collections has remained at around 40%. The provincial government has strictly limited the collection to be completed by the end of January, otherwise it will be dealt with as a delay in the war opportunity. The county government held an emergency meeting on the 27th to discuss collection methods, and immediately decided to dispatch all section chiefs, secretaries, and the director and deputy director of the Land and Grain Office to various townships to collect taxes, starting on the 29th, in order to achieve results.</p>

<h3>Qidong Assembly Collects Evidence of Traitor Tian Tiefu's Crimes; Traitor Zhang Xia'hun Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Yancheng Dispatch] Tian Tiefu, commander of the 34th Regiment of the puppet army, committed all kinds of evils during the period when the county was occupied by the enemy, relying on the power of his treachery. He kidnapped and extorted, murdered loyal and righteous people, looted villages, and sold drugs. His crimes are countless and have been widely reported in the Beijing-Shanghai area, causing grief and resentment throughout the county. Now that this traitor was arrested in Shanghai last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command sent personnel to transfer him from the Shanghai High Court to Zhenjiang for trial. Upon hearing this, the County Temporary Assembly believed that this traitor had enslaved the people and committed heinous crimes. If he is not severely punished, how can justice be served? Therefore, it has issued a public notice to the people, urging all victims to quickly list the true facts and circumstances of the harm they suffered in order to submit them to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and request punishment to uphold national law and appease public anger.</p>

<p>[Our Liuhe Dispatch] The weather in the county seat during the Spring Festival was unusually cold, with heavy snowfall again. The snow continued to fall until morning. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 a.m. on the same day, a fire broke out east of the County Police Bureau. The on-duty police officer discovered the fire and sounded the alarm. However, due to the intensity of the fire, despite the efforts of various fire hydrants to extinguish it, it could not be contained. Within 20 minutes, four businesses, including Fang Guangfeng South Goods Store, Bai Hengshun Candle Workshop, Dai Shunchang Cloth Store, and resident Chen Shaoqing, were completely destroyed. All assets and goods were reduced to ashes, resulting in losses of approximately 500 million yuan. In addition, the Chenghuang Temple in the county seat caught fire at around 11:00 a.m. on the last day of the lunar year. The fire was caused by a large amount of fuel piled in front of the Second Hall of the Second Master God statue. Sparks from incense and candles ignited the fuel, causing it to burn rapidly. Smoke filled the air, and flames shot out in all directions. Fortunately, a pilgrim discovered the fire and called for help. Fire brigades arrived quickly after receiving the alarm and extinguished the fire.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Repays County Government Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Qingpu Dispatch] At the beginning of the victory in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the county government lacked funding for administrative expenses.

<h3>Jiading Businesses Survive Lunar New Year, Few Bankruptcies</h3>
<p>[Our Jiading Dispatch] Due to the impact of high interest rates and low purchasing power, industry and commerce in the county have been declining recently. During the Lunar New Year, businesses in the urban and rural areas, with the exception of a few bankruptcies, were generally able to barely make it through. This reporter visited a leader in the business community, who stated that only businesses dealing in southern goods, yarn, cloth, and general merchandise, as well as small and medium-sized yarn mills, were profitable last year. Other industries, such as timber, tea, and grocery stores, as well as soy sauce and wine businesses, suffered losses. Small flour mills and yellow grass mat businesses were particularly sluggish.</p>

<h3>Poor Fishing Season in Yuhuan</h3>
<p>[Our Yuhuan Dispatch] Fishermen on the various island of Bishan, Yangyu, and Jiguanshan in this county have experienced a poor winter fishing season due to the harsh weather conditions, resulting in a very small catch.

As a result, their lives are extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Conscription Supervisor Abuses Power, Provokes Public Anger</h3>
<p>[Our Dongyang Dispatch] Zhao Quanli, a resident of Yizhi Township, Fifth Bao, in this county, is overage. When the roster of able-bodied men was compiled last year, the Bao chief mistakenly filled him in as a Class A able-bodied man. This time, during the temporary conscription, his number was drawn. The township conscription supervisor, Jiang Guojun, ignored everything and conscripted him. After local gentry provided proof, Jiang became angry at the township chief and arbitrarily fined Bao Chief Zhao Xingcang 20,000 yuan in legal currency, otherwise he would be detained. Despite repeated requests from others and the initial payment of 10,000 yuan, Jiang refused to agree, which aroused public anger. The township representatives filed a complaint with the county government, accusing Jiang of extortion under false pretenses, requesting a severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Jinhua Bans Gambling and Prostitution During Spring Festival</h3>
<p>[Our Jinhua Dispatch] As the Lunar New Year approaches, some unscrupulous individuals are taking the opportunity to become active. Consequently, cases of theft, gambling, and prostitution have increased in recent days. According to the person in charge of the police bureau, strict prohibition of the above cases for several months has reduced them somewhat. However, the general public, constrained by old customs, inevitably relapses before and after the New Year. The police bureau has reiterated its determination to thoroughly investigate and prohibit these activities. In addition to ordering the criminal investigation team to earnestly handle the cases, police officers will be dispatched every night to conduct investigations.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation to Be Reorganized into Highway Bureau</h3>

<h3>A Trip to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border</h3>
<p>— By Our Correspondent Jiang Hong</p>
<p>Quzhou, 14th</p>
<p>The Zherao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been open for almost a week. In order to understand the situation along the line, the reporter braved the severe winter cold and decided to make this short journey of over 100 kilometers.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, the sky was gloomy and it looked like it was going to rain. As soon as I got up, I hurried to the Quzhou Station. When I arrived, Chief Li was already standing far away in front of the station to greet me. We talked as we walked around the station. A small new station building stands on the base that has not yet been leveled. The luggage room next to it and the warehouse opposite have not yet been built. Many goods were piled up on the platform, some unloaded last night and some waiting to be shipped. If it suddenly rains on the open-air platform, those goods such as paper will be very troublesome. At exactly 8 o'clock, the train started. Because</p>
<p>The Roadbed Stones Are Not Yet Laid, It Only Travels 15 Kilometers Per Hour. I was sitting in the guard's van. Most of the space in that guard's van, which was converted from one-third of a train car, was occupied by a large safe. The remaining space was filled with four train crew members and the reporter, five people in total. We were chatting around a brazier, from the former director Zhang Zili to the new director Hou Jiayuan, from the restoration of the track to the salary increase. Their perception of Director Hou can be represented by the words of a person in charge of the car: "Director Hou is actually not bad. As soon as he took office, he gave us a salary increase..." Everything today is measured by money. After listening to their conversation, I had this feeling.</p>
<p>After the train passed the Houxijie Station, the speed gradually increased, but it was only 20 kilometers per hour. The station building in Houxijie is also newly built, but it is smaller than the Quzhou Station. The doors and windows are made of wood, not as beautiful as the glass ones in the Quzhou Station.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Jiangshan Station, the north wind outside the window became tighter, and the road police on the platform shrank their heads tightly into the collars of their coats. Since the opening of the Quzhou station, the Jiangshan station has become deserted. There are only a few country folks carrying burdens waiting for the train on the platform, and the rest are the blue-uniformed traffic personnel. The reporter boarded the passenger car in front. The passengers were crowded to the point where no water could leak through. Four foreign religious figures were playing "poker" proudly and leisurely. A group of country bumpkins surrounded them, staring intently as if watching something novel.</p>
<p>When the train arrived at Xintangbian Station, the 22nd down train had not yet arrived (the two passenger trains were supposed to meet here). Later, I learned from the station that the 22nd train derailed at the San Dao track at Yushan Station because the sleepers were moldy and the tracks had sunk.</p>
<p>It is rare to have a derailment in the station. In recent times, derailments have been heard from time to time, such as on the 29th and 30th of last month between Yushan and Dukou, and between Jinqiao and Shaxi. Fortunately, the speed of the trains on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is very low, so there was no major loss.</p>
<p>Around 1:00 p.m., the train arrived at Wangshan Station. This place is more lively than the other intermediate stations, and the platform is full of goods. Because the locomotive needs to take on water here, there is a half-hour stop. The passengers on the train, after six hours of shaking, need to eat, so they compete to get off the train to find food. The various food stalls opposite the station are doing brisk business. With a little effort, a long row of stalls is covered with patrons like flies. The Railway Bureau has a Yushan machine factory at Wangshan Station. The locomotives on the Qurano section are inspected and repaired here. The factory is currently rushing to manufacture passenger cars. Currently, five third-class passenger cars have been produced, and two more will be completed soon. At 3:30 p.m., we arrived at Rao. The short journey of 120 kilometers was finally completed in eight hours.</p>
<p>Shangrao, this place that rose during the war, is still</p>
<p>A Commercial Hub in Eastern Jiangxi Due to Its Excellent Location. The streets are bustling with people, as lively as before. Unfortunately, the streets are not as complete as they were three years ago. The stone-paved road surface has been carved out by wheelbarrows into crisscrossing rivers and continuous swamps. The intersections are blocked by wooden fences and stones, making it difficult even for rickshaws to pass through. It is said that this is to prohibit cars from passing through the city. It is indeed too unwise to abandon eating because of choking. On the other hand, small chartered cars are still flying around the streets. Isn't this a strong contrast?</p>
<p>There are many officers from the 11th Army Officer Corps here. Recently, they were ordered to merge with the 12th Corps and will be leaving for Hangzhou. Precisely because of the merger and other reasons, there are still about 400 unemployed officers who have not been accepted for training, stranded in Shangrao, without food or accommodation, which is extremely miserable. The reporter personally saw an unemployed officer eating in a restaurant and not being able to pay, so the shopkeeper willingly sent him to the police station. For the sake of the lives of these hundreds of people, the Shangrao County Government has allocated 500,000 yuan to send them back to their hometowns and is handling registration matters in the Zhongzheng Hall, but each person is allocated only over 1,000 yuan, which is like a drop in the bucket. What good is it?</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province County Magistrate Assessment: Second Examination Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Zhejiang Province is holding a county magistrate assessment. The first examination was previously held, and eight candidates were admitted. Since there are another 65 applicants for assessment, it has been decided to hold a second examination on February 8th. However, those who failed the first examination will not be allowed to participate.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Conclude Forty-Year Pact to Prevent German Rearmament; Washington Suggests Revisiting Old Proposals</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] A treaty to prohibit German rearmament for forty years was initially proposed by former Secretary of State Byrnes over a year ago. It is said that Stalin himself agreed to this proposal at one point, but Foreign Minister Molotov later opposed it, preventing the case from being seriously discussed in any four-power meeting. It was only during the New York meeting of the four foreign ministers last December that it was agreed to include the treaty proposal as the fourth item on the agenda for the Moscow meeting in March of this year. Therefore, the importance of this case is almost equal to that of the German-Austrian peace treaty; in fact, it can be regarded as part of the entire German peace settlement. Secretary of State Marshall did not initiate the treaty plan, but the experts and advisors under him certainly felt this way. The semi-official Pravda accused British Foreign Secretary Bevin of abandoning the British-Soviet alliance. Only after Foreign Secretary Bevin and Stalin exchanged notes, with the former guaranteeing loyalty to the alliance and the latter accepting this guarantee, did relations smooth out. Pravda first expressed goodwill towards the Americans, and then towards the British. Washington believes this is a conspiracy to isolate the Western powers. Regarding the issue of alliances, US officials believe that such alliances, if always within the framework of the UN Charter, are not a problem. At the same time, in the European context, alliances can enhance the unity of various countries and establish a sense of common security.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Vandenberg's Remarks, Calling Them a Destruction of the Foundation for Cooperation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 26th] Pravda stated today that if the United States adheres to the foreign policy of Republican leader Vandenberg and Dulles, it will damage the true foundation of international cooperation in the future. The blueprint for Vandenberg's foreign policy, outlined in his speech in Cleveland on the 11th of this month, is an expansionist plan that matches the words and deeds of imperialists. Dulles's proposal that the German economy be linked to its European neighbors, such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, is a disguised form of Churchill's advocacy of a European Federation.</p>
<h3>British-French Alliance Treaty Draft Near Completion</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The Times' diplomatic correspondent reveals that the future British-French alliance treaty has been drafted by the British Foreign Office, and the British government is preparing to start negotiations. At the same time, restoring relations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the basis of a new treaty, dispelling doubts, is conducive to British-French relations, as too close a British-French relationship could weaken the connection between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>US State Department Releases Secret Documents from Last Paris Peace Conference</h3>
<h3>Premier Clemenceau Suggested Surrounding the Soviet Union with a Barbed-Wire Fence</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The US State Department announced yesterday that secret documents from the 1919 Paris Peace Conference reveal that French Premier Clemenceau suggested that the Allied Powers and their partners should set up a kind of barbed-wire fence to surround the Soviet Union to prevent it from disrupting the world. This was because the attempt to support anti-Bolshevik forces at the time had failed, so Clemenceau made this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Offers Suggestions for Drafting a Peace Treaty with Germany</h3>
<p>Must Be Approved by German Central Government; Austrian Delegation to Visit Britain</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: The Soviet Union today made a surprising request to the Four Foreign Ministers, stating that the German central government should be allowed to offer opinions on the peace treaty with Germany, and that the final peace treaty must be approved by the German state. This request was made by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev in a written document. Gusev also suggested that the Allied countries should draft the peace treaty with Germany according to the drafting procedure for the peace treaties with Italy and the former Axis satellites.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 26th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl and his country's delegation boarded a fast train tonight via Paris to London to attend the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting to present Austria's case.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Toulon, France, 26th] Representatives from various countries on the UN Fact-Finding Committee boarded a French cruiser today and departed from here to Greece to conduct an on-site investigation into the situation in that country. They are expected to arrive in Athens on the 29th of this month. The Chinese representative is Dr. Jin Wenshi, Ambassador to Belgium; the Australian representative is Mr. Hood; the Belgian representative is Lieutenant General Tailleur; the Brazilian representative is General Tostes; the Colombian representative is Mr. Olarte, Minister to Belgium; the French representative is Mr. Taux, Professor of History at the University of Paris; the British representative is Mr. Winckler; and the American representative is Ms. Esseryridge.

<p>[This newspaper, London, 27th Broadcast, Athens] The chief representative of the Soviet delegation to the UN Fact-Finding Committee, Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Lavrentiev, arrived at the Hassani Airport this afternoon by plane.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Capital of Yugoslavia, 26th] Officials recently announced that Yugoslavia applied to the Greek authorities for passports to send representatives to Greece to participate in the United Nations Implementation Investigation Committee, but was rejected. The Yugoslav government therefore lodged a strong protest with the Greek authorities yesterday through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>US Representative to the Security Council Visits Marshall for Instructions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Marshall is entering his second week as Secretary of State and is about to deal with the most urgent and difficult issue facing the United States, namely, the international control of atomic energy. Austin, the US representative to the Atomic Energy Committee of the Security Council, came here to visit Marshall to receive instructions before the Security Council re-discusses the two issues of atomic energy and disarmament on February 4.</p>
<h3>US Plans to Implement Japanese Reparations Plan Immediately; Expresses Dissatisfaction with Soviet and Canadian Lack of Input</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Officials announced today that the Soviet Union and Canada intend to delay the implementation of the US plan to immediately distribute Japanese reparations. The State Department asked the relevant countries last November to jointly draft instructions to be sent to MacArthur, instructing him on how to distribute 15% to 20% of the Japanese reparations first. The Soviet Union and Canada have ignored this. China, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, India, and the Netherlands have all submitted their opinions to the State Department. The US government is now considering taking steps regardless of the opinions of the Soviet Union and Canada. China, the Philippines, and other countries are deeply dissatisfied with the delay in the distribution of Japanese reparations and advocate the speedy dismantling and transportation of the designated Japanese factory machinery, otherwise it will rust and become unusable. The Soviet representative had previously blocked the formation of an agreement in the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. It is unclear why Canada has not responded. Its representative may express an opinion soon, and it is hoped that the Soviet representative will also join the discussion in the end. The US-Soviet dispute mainly concerns the scope of reparations. The Soviet Union insists that what its troops obtained in the three eastern provinces of China should be regarded as "war booty." The Pauley Report opposes this, believing that the Soviet Union's removal of machinery in the three eastern provinces has made it impossible to restore the industry there, valued at US$1.1 billion. If this kind of machinery removed by the Soviet Union is used as reparations, then its share of the Japanese reparations should be reduced. Although the United States has not specified in detail how to distribute Japanese reparations, it advocates that China, Australia, the Philippines, and India should receive the majority.</p>
<p>Canadian Statement</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 26th] Canadian diplomatic officials declared today that it is surprising that the United States has expressed dissatisfaction because Canada has not yet provided its views on the distribution of Japanese reparations. In fact, this matter is under consideration, and Canada will soon submit its suggestions. It is true that the Canadian cabinet has been slow to decide on a policy, but this is purely due to certain circumstances beyond the control of Canadian authorities. In short, there is no malicious intent behind Canada's delay in replying.</p>

<h3>A War of Words in the Far East Tribunal; Defense Attorney Accuses MacArthur of Overreach; Presiding Judge Webb Sternly Refutes</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th] At this morning's session of the Far East International Tribunal, Presiding Judge Webb and Smith, the defense attorney for the defendant Hirota, engaged in a war of words, which was the first such conflict in the history of the military tribunal. The dispute arose when the defense attorney presented a general statement requesting that the legal action against the 26 defendants be dropped on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence. The presiding judge refuted this and ordered each defense attorney to submit a defense brief for his client individually.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the session, Webb rejected three other briefs, namely: (1) errors in interrogation, (2) opposition to MacArthur's legal rights, and (3) opposition to the jurisdiction of the court. Webb refuted the latter two points vehemently, stating that involving MacArthur was a violation of regulations. These words angered Smith, who spoke on behalf of half of the defendants, threatening to appeal to the US Supreme Court. Webb immediately retorted, saying, "Your appeal to Washington is irrelevant to us. Know that the court is not a parliament or congress." "MacArthur's authority is not subject to your public debate. If you believe that fairness is being violated, you can file a defense in a legal manner, but you cannot issue politically charged condemnations." After Webb finished speaking, several lawyers hurriedly assured the court that they recognized MacArthur's authority. Smith's brief pointed out that MacArthur had violated the US Constitution by accepting the position of Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan and overstepping his authority to organize the Far East International Tribunal.</p>
<h3>Churchill Today</h3>
<p>— By Xu Zhongpei, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in London</p>
<p>"Each generation produces its own talented writers, each leading the way through trials and hardships for a decade."</p>
<p>Recently, there was a long discussion in England about whether a statue of Roosevelt should be seated or standing. The "News Chronicle" published a timely cartoon, titled "Erecting a Statue for the Living." In the chair Roosevelt used to sit in, an empty space is filled by a worried Truman, looking lost. Beside him, a statue of Churchill is leaning, about to fall over.</p>
<p>This truly symbolizes the current state of Churchill. This fall is a fall within his current circumstances, not a complete downfall including his past. Churchill is a statesman of his generation, leading Britain through hardships to victory amidst missile strikes. His glorious past cannot be forgotten, like a setting sun, still radiant even as it descends below the horizon.</p>
<p>He still possesses the people's affection and remains one of the most respected Britons. When he speaks in Parliament, it is like a father instructing his sons, and the members treat him with the respect due to an elder relative. However, all this past glory is merely a shadow in reality. To put it nicely, it is ahead of its time. One member said, "Whenever Churchill speaks in Parliament, everyone puts aside the topic under discussion and respectfully listens to his speech, listening to his attacks on the government. Once he finishes and takes his seat, everyone picks up where they left off and resumes the discussion." His appearance is merely an interlude that doesn't address the main issue.</p>
<p>Britain's Old Hero</p>
<p>Although many political commentators haven't yet freely used their sharp pens against the old hero who has served the country, they have already expressed open dissatisfaction with him. Many of these commentators vigorously supported Churchill during the war, but now their attitude has changed drastically. Their change of heart isn't due to snobbery, but as one commentator aptly put it, "One cannot judge a person solely based on their past—especially when they are still active in politics."</p>
<p>Churchill is, of course, still an active figure in politics. Although the Conservative Party lost in the last election, he remains the leader of the opposition. He speaks eloquently, writes movingly, and is a talented man. The abandonment of him by outstanding political commentators is because all of his policies lag behind the times, and he can even be said to have no policies at all.</p>
<p>Attlee is Likable</p>
<p>Churchill's successor, Attlee, may not be eloquent, but he speaks to the point, and everyone who has met him feels his sincerity. He is patient, willing to take losses, and shows no arrogance or conceit. His performance in office for the past year and a half has made the people love him, and political commentators have begun to discover his many merits. Moreover, he has chosen good assistants; Morrison and Bevin are both competent. Compared to the group of officials who took office after Roosevelt in the United States, the British post-war government appears more mature and skilled at managing everything. Therefore, while Americans fondly remember Roosevelt, the British feel that they don't have a Churchill government that knows what it is doing, and even that the government's concrete policies are much better than those of Churchill's government—this is Churchill's fatal flaw.</p>
<p>Wouldn't Churchill want to catch up quickly? No one is more aware of the changes in the outside world than himself. His speech in Fulton and his travels in Europe are nothing more than attempts to maintain his momentum. Recently, he also prepared to strengthen the party's organization and rename the Conservative Party the Unified Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The Labor Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," mocked him, saying, "In fact, all the divisions within the Conservative Party cannot be unified by renaming it, it will never be unified. But within this future unified party, there is one thing on which everyone agrees: Churchill can go write his memoirs, can go to many small European countries to speak about Europe forming a single family, but he doesn't need to cling so desperately to the title of leader of the opposition."</p>
<p>The Labor Party and the Conservative Party are opposed to each other, and Futuo's statement is, of course, excessive, but if the slanderous parts of the party struggle are removed, Futuo's words also have their truth. The general young people of the Conservative Party know that their party's struggles are outdated and aspire to rise up and reform. Therefore, it is said that they hope the old ones will retire, either openly or secretly, but whenever there are such rumors, Churchill will definitely make a public statement: "I will continue to lead the Conservative Party."</p>
<p>The Liberal Party's Attitude</p>
<p>The Liberal Party, aside from the Labor and Conservative parties, is now closely following the government and cooperating well. Therefore, they inevitably have cold irony and hot sarcasm for Churchill, who has enjoyed great fame, believing that his criticism of the Attlee government is too harsh, and Attlee has shown magnanimity in humility and tolerance.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's attitude towards Churchill is self-evident. Given Churchill's attacks on Stalin, the Communist Party cannot help but hate Churchill to the bone.</p>
<p>In the press, "The Times" is a unique independent faction, free from all parties. But when Churchill raised the question in Parliament, "Does the government know that the Soviet army has about two hundred divisions in Europe?", "The Times" also wrote an article criticizing Churchill, believing that if Churchill knew the intelligence was true, he should have notified the government, not shouted it out in public.</p>
<p>But Churchill himself still has a stubborn, obstinate, willful, and unyielding spirit. He immerses himself in the glory of the past, writing his memoirs, and still leads the opposition in Parliament. Although he is old, he will never become a second Lloyd George.</p>
<p>Time is Most Ruthless</p>
<p>Unfortunately, time is ruthless. Churchill's protest against the British army leaving Egypt and the dispute over Indian independence, compared with the Labor government's policies, show how dim he has become, and also show that time has left Churchill behind. In Parliament, he delivered a speech on the Indian issue, reminiscing about the past glory. Although the speech was moving, in the face of this urgent problem, and when the world believes that Indian independence is a wise measure by the Labor government, how stale and unnecessary this recollection seems.</p>
<p>Churchill's prestige is undoubtedly declining, and along with him is the dignity of the Conservative Party. A Liberal Party commentator even speculated that the Conservative Party may never have the opportunity to govern again. But in the minds of the people, who have solid memories, he is still a legendary hero—although his legend already belongs to the past.</p>
<p>In the royal family, he is still loved and respected. His father was the Duke of Marlborough, he is an aristocrat, and he often has contact with the royal family. The Prime Minister is scheduled to meet the Emperor every week to report on the state of administration. It is said that when Churchill was in power, he always went to court in the morning, had lunch with the Emperor and Empress in the palace, and talked and laughed until three o'clock before leaving. Now, Prime Minister Attlee always goes to court at six o'clock in the afternoon, and leaves in a hurry after the conversation, at most having a drink with the Emperor.</p>
<h3>To Ensure National Security, A Strong Army is Needed. The US Secretary of the Army Advocates Universal Military Training and Intensified Preparation to Cope with Atomic Warfare.</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] Secretary of the Army Patterson delivered a speech to the Women's National Defense Association today, listing three basic needs of the US Army to properly ensure national security. It is said that the United States must establish a strong army of more than one million people, and universal military training must be implemented. In the past, from the initial appearance of a war until the storm arrived, there was still a considerable period of time to engage in training, but in the future, there will be no such preparation time. The initial indication of the outbreak of war will be bombs and radio-controlled missiles falling on our cities. The Army's budget of $6.7 billion has been reduced to barely enough to meet its minimum basic needs. Strategic Air Command Commander Keenan said that the United States will be the first target to be attacked in a future war. [United Press International, Washington, 26th] US Strategic Air Command Commander Keenan continued to say in a speech: In a future world war, the United States will be the first target to be attacked, with enemy planes attacking from both sides, killing or injuring 25 million people in the first 24 hours. The United States will be listed first on the list that Hitler first gave to his subordinates. Those who carry out the attack will be piloted and unpiloted aircraft. Radio-controlled missiles and rockets will all be loaded with atomic bombs, super explosives, super incendiary bombs, and germ bombs, or other popular weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>The British-Egyptian negotiations reversed, and the reason for the failure was that the two sides differed on the issue of Sudan. The point of the British army withdrawing from Egyptian territory was easier to resolve. The picture shows the simple ceremony held when the British army withdrew from Cairo.</p>

<h3>Inside Story of the Seymour Road Fire: Committee Organized for Thorough Investigation, Hoping Citizens Won't Endure in Silence. Speaker Pan Announces Details of Conversation with Director Xuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan convened reporters at the council in Fumin Village at 3:00 PM yesterday, discussing the Seymour Road-Wuding Road fire, hoping citizens would assist the government in promoting a new social atmosphere and prevent illegal incidents from continuing. Speaker Pan stated that regarding the Seymour Road fire, there were many rumors circulating about the behavior of personnel from the City Police Bureau and Fire Department. Although what was said lacked basis, there were indeed complaints from all sides. He had already discussed the matter with Council Secretary-General Xiang Changquan the day before, hoping that the convener and members of the Council's Police Affairs Committee, or other city councilors, especially those elected in the area, would pay special attention to this matter and conduct a thorough investigation. The further purpose was to hope that similar incidents would not occur again in the future.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan also announced details of his conversation with Director Xuan Tiewu, stating that he had expressed to Director Xuan that the incident was the responsibility of the Fire Department. Although the fire department is a separate system, it is related to the police bureau. In the past, there were such bad habits in this city, and it is hoped that they will not occur again now. Although the treatment of firefighters is meager, firefighting is a heroic act that is worthy of our admiration. This heroic spirit should not be negatively affected and destroyed. Therefore, a rigorous investigation is required. If any illegal personnel are found, they will definitely be severely punished. At the same time, it is hoped that the affected citizens will come forward and report the matter voluntarily, and do not endure in silence. The individual will absolutely not protect anyone and hopes that citizens will cooperate with the government to correct bad habits. Director Xuan immediately telephoned the Fire Department Director, ordering him to jointly investigate with the Baojia and related personnel and visit the affected residents in many ways.</p>
<p>Finally, Speaker Pan earnestly hoped that citizens would no longer swallow their anger after suffering losses as in the past, and that past bad habits must be reformed, otherwise the bad social atmosphere will never be corrected. At the same time, since citizens bear many taxes to the municipal authorities, the authorities should also take into account the lives and property of the citizens at all times and provide insurance.</p>
<p>The Council Has the Right to Publicly Question</p>
<p>Also, according to the Council, the Council has the right to publicly question the Fire Department's dereliction of duty and is currently conducting detailed investigations at the scene of the incident separately. The Police Bureau was originally scheduled to publicly report the truth after its investigation yesterday, but the victim Wang Yunfu did not meet with the person in charge when he went to the Police Bureau yesterday, so there were no results. However, according to the Police Bureau, based on the investigation in recent days, it cannot be fully proven that the Fire Department was derelict in its duties.</p>
<h3>Five-Person Committee to Meet This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The City Government decided to form a "Five-Person Committee" to investigate and discuss the handling of the Seymour Road fire. The five people are composed of representatives from the City Government, the Police Bureau, the District Chief of the 10th District (Jingan), representatives of the victims, and City Councilor Zhang Nai-zuo.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Tan, the purpose of organizing the five-person investigation committee is to facilitate the affected parties to have the opportunity to make open reports. If there is evidence, the Mayor and Director Xuan will definitely investigate it strictly. Mayor Wu summoned Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang yesterday afternoon and asked him questions. The first meeting of the five-person committee will be held in the City Government Auditorium at 3:00 PM today, and the Mayor will personally attend and preside over the meeting.</p>
<p>The City Council has asked the conveners of the Police Affairs Committee, Zhang Nai-zuo, Fei Shu-sheng, Hou Ji-yuan, and City Councilors Zhu Wen-qi and Qian Nai-wen to jointly investigate.</p>
<h3>District Attorney's Office Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The District Attorney's Office is also paying close attention to the Seymour Road fire. If firefighters are found to have extorted, robbed property, or failed to put out the fire, etc., it is a serious crime, and the law will not be lenient. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang told reporters yesterday that he hoped that all sectors would provide concrete evidence for the case to facilitate the investigation.</p>
<h3>Chen Tingrui's Letter to the Deputy Speakers: Advocates Private Management of Fire Affairs in the Central District</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Former Chinese Director of the Municipal Council and current Councilor Chen Tingrui sent a letter to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu yesterday, stating: "My friend Zhang Yizhen was also one of the victims in the Seymour Road fire. When I went to visit him yesterday, according to Mr. Zhang, the situation of the fire was roughly the same as what was recorded in the Shen Bao and Da Gong Bao. The Wang family is still there, so it should not be difficult to investigate the truth. Fire affairs are one of the most important municipal affairs, and the lives and property of citizens are at stake. Firefighters have allowed the fire to burn for as long as thirteen hours, and what I have heard makes me feel like I am living in another world. You are the voice of the people, and the whole city admires you. I have the same feeling and dare to ask, as a citizen, that you join the municipal authorities in thoroughly investigating the matter to clarify responsibility. I am very fortunate. Furthermore, the importance of fire affairs is known to all. Rather than being managed by the government and becoming corrupt, it is better for citizens to manage it themselves and make it well-organized. The volunteer fire departments in Huhang and Zhabei in this city have achieved remarkable results, which is a precedent. Whether the fire affairs in the central district should be managed by the private sector in the future can be discussed in the City Council."</p>
<h3>Fake Undersecretary Deaf and Blind, Released on Bail for Medical Treatment Due to Serious Illness, Suddenly Reported Dead Outside, High Court Summons Person in Charge of Funeral Home</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Han traitor suspect Shen Qichang, 71 years old, who is deaf and blind, was released on bail for medical treatment from a court of the High Court on December 10 last year due to serious illness. Recently, the defendant's family submitted a statement to the High Court, reporting that Shen had died of illness on December 27 last year, and the body had been sent to the Paradise Funeral Home for encoffining. The High Court authorities believed that it was necessary to investigate this matter and summoned the person in charge of the Paradise Funeral Home for questioning. Yesterday, Lu Housun, the accountant of the funeral home, brought the account books to court to answer the questions. He said that on December 28 last year, there was indeed a body named Shen Qichang sent by the family, and it was encoffined on the 29th. In addition to the coffin, a total of 1,094,400 yuan was spent on encoffining. There are account books and bills as proof, but it is impossible to know whether the body is Shen Qichang himself. After the clerk made a note of the record, he was ordered to leave the court.</p>
<p>Shen was a scholar in the Qing Dynasty, who served as a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Qing government. After the Republic of China, he served as a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, he transferred to the judiciary and served in courts in Tianjin, Guangdong, Shandong, and other places. Before the War of Resistance, he practiced law in Shanghai. In 1940, he served as a member of the puppet Supervisory Committee. In 1941, he was transferred to the position of Undersecretary of the puppet Audit Department. In 1943, he resigned due to illness.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Puppet Accomplices, One Sentenced to Six Years, One to Three Years</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The High Court announced the sentences in two cases of suspected Han traitors yesterday morning: (1) Tang Yaoliang, who was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy army stationed in Songjiang Yangqiao and a secret agent for the puppet Songjiang Political Security Bureau, was sentenced to six years in prison and six years of deprivation of civil rights. (2) Jin Yulin, who was accused of serving as the head of the intelligence section of the puppet Zhejiang Pinghu Security Brigade and the head of the puppet Jiaxing Yifeng Township, was sentenced to three years in prison and three years of deprivation of civil rights.

<h3>British Ships Hope to Navigate Inland Rivers, Our Shipping Industry Pays Close Attention, Li Yunliang Expresses Opinions on the Sino-British Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Recently, the British House of Lords discussed the China-related issues. Lord Chancellor Jowitt and Lord Elwyn-Jones expressed their hope that the Sino-British Commercial Treaty would stipulate that British ships would be free to navigate the coast and inland rivers of China, which has aroused great attention in the shipping industry. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Association, to inquire about his views on the above issues. According to Mr. Li, what Chinese people are worried about at this time is that the Sino-British Commercial Treaty will be nominally equal in the future, but in reality, it will lack protection for China's immature shipping industry and will become a one-sided preference for Britain. Or, as rumored, China and Britain have other exchange conditions that allow British ships to re-enjoy special privileges in our inland rivers and coastal areas. The government should determine the pros and cons and not repeat the mistakes after the Opium War, so that China's shipping industry will never be able to recover.</p>

The technical personnel are still under the control of the Health Bureau, while the remaining ordinary business personnel can be reduced to save public funds. Their work will be undertaken by the district office personnel and the Baojia. Decision: First draft a plan, and then send it to the Health Committee for study.

<h3>Post-Release Issues for Pardoned Prisoners Await Planning Relief Measures Already in Place for Female Inmates Over One Hundred Child Inmates Sent to Reformatories</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Shanghai Prison continued to release a total of eighty-four prisoners yesterday who met the conditions for the general amnesty and reduced sentences, most of whom were opium offenders. Many family members of the prisoners gathered in front of the prison gate, and when they saw the released prisoners walking out of the gate, they immediately stepped forward to inquire about the recent situation of their relatives in prison and the date of their release. The prison will continue to release people in the coming days. In addition, the North Zhejiang Road Temporary Detention Center also released fifteen people yesterday.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the number of people released under the general amnesty totaled one thousand and two from Shanghai Prison, one hundred and forty-three from the Women's Prison, and approximately one thousand and three hundred from the Reformatory.</p>
<p>The post-release issues for those released under the amnesty are of great concern to all sectors of society. If they walk out of the prison gate and have no home to return to and no way to make a living, they will inevitably fall into the clutches of the law again, which will affect social security. A reporter visited a well-known figure in the Shanghai judicial community for this purpose, who said that the government must have considered this issue before issuing the amnesty decree. However, the reporter witnessed that many of the released prisoners had no money, were thinly dressed, or had a long journey home. It is now known that when female prisoners are released, the Women's Prison distributes a total of one hundred black cloth cotton qipaos obtained from the Post-War Relief Administration. Those who have no money are assisted with travel expenses, totaling more than 30,000 yuan. Those who have no home to return to are taken in by the Women's Release Protection Association. The association is presided over by Pan Fu, of the Yangjingbang Catholic Church, who has been preaching in prison for fourteen years. The address is No. 1, Tianyou Lane, Zhaojiabang Road, Nanshi. Currently, the association has taken in and assisted more than ten people. As for male prisoners, there is no relief organization like the Protection Association. Only warm clothes are distributed at the time of release, or part of the travel expenses are subsidized. In addition, over one hundred child offenders, who were previously members of the Guangniu Party or Water Rats, will be concentrated today and sent to the Caohejing Children's Reformatory to be trained and taught life skills.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Most Glorious Day Today Commemorates "January 28th"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Today is the 15th anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War. This was the first time that the National Army officially fought against and defeated the Japanese invaders on the battlefield, and it was also the precursor to the Chinese nation's steadfast resistance to violence. The foundation for the victory of the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War was laid here. The City Party Headquarters has specially launched a campaign to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers to show respect. A memorial meeting will be held at 9:00 AM today on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, with Li Jishen and Huang Yanpei serving as chairman and vice-chairman. Ma Yinchu, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Dongsun, and others have been invited to attend and give speeches.</p>
<p>A reporter visited Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM yesterday to ask him to express his thoughts on the "January 28th" Shanghai War Memorial. Mayor Wu replied: "January 28th" is indeed the most glorious day for our city, and it is worthy of our remembrance and reflection on this 15th anniversary. What is gratifying now is that the Japanese invaders have been defeated and our country has finally achieved final victory. Therefore, it is right to commemorate it today, but holding a grand meeting is not really necessary.</p>
<p>[Another Report] People from all walks of life will hold a grand meeting today to commemorate the martyrs and honor loyalty, to comfort the forty-six "Four-Row Warehouse孤軍" soldiers who remained in Shanghai, and the three hundred and thirty-nine honored soldiers who recently returned from Hong Kong and Macau.

At noon, they will be treated to lunch at the Friends of the Military Society.

<h3>Citizens Neglect Anti-Theft Knowledge Creating Opportunities for Criminals Jing'an District Holds Anti-Theft Propaganda Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Tenth District (Jing'an District) Office and the Jing'ansi Police Station held a joint anti-theft propaganda meeting yesterday morning at the Majestic Theatre. More than 500 baojia chiefs from the district attended, and Jin Deshi, the district chief of the Tenth District, served as the chairman. At the meeting, according to Police Chief Zhou Weiting's report, theft cases in the Jing'an District have been greatly reduced after the implementation of the police management system. At a time when the social and economic crisis is severe, prices are soaring, and there are many unemployed people, and recently, one or two thousand people have been released from prison under the amnesty, if these people have no home to return to and cannot make a living, they will be forced to return to their old ways. The reason for the formation of general theft cases is mainly due to the instability of the political situation and the difficulty of people's livelihood, but the lack or neglect of anti-theft knowledge by the general public also creates opportunities for criminals to take advantage of. If precautions are strictly taken, they will have no chance to take advantage of. It is hoped that everyone will read the anti-theft notices issued by the police station and spread them widely so that everyone in the jurisdiction can know them. The police station is determined to do its best to prevent and arrest criminals, and everyone should be on strict guard for their own lives and property.</p>

After being earnestly urged to stay by all parties, the intention to resign may have been dispelled. As for Director Wu's request for resignation, it was purely due to suffering from neurological problems. After receiving his resignation letter, Mayor Wu immediately had earnest discussions with him and gave him a two-week leave for recuperation. Mr. Wu has now accepted it.

<h3>Taikoo Wharf Workers Dispute Over Two Hundred People Seek Reinstatement</h3>
<p>The dispute between the new and old workers at the Taikoo Wharf on Jinling Road Bund in this city over the right to carry cargo has lasted for a long time and has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Yesterday morning, more than two hundred unemployed old workers, led by the chief foreman Zhou Ruiye, gathered at the Taikoo Wharf. They planned to negotiate with the new foreman, Chen Shanyu, to demand immediate reinstatement. Because Chen had heard the news and left, the group of old workers gathered at the wharf and refused to disperse. Fearing a conflict between the two groups of workers, the Taikoo Company closed the wharf warehouse and temporarily suspended the receipt and dispatch of goods. The Huangpu Police Station and the Port Affairs Committee Police Team were reported and immediately sent police to suppress the situation. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. The group of old workers dispersed in the afternoon. It is reported that they have decided to gather all the old workers today to petition Mayor Wu, state everything, and request a prompt and fair settlement.

They all hope that the主管 authorities will quickly give a fair and reasonable solution to the dispute between the two groups of workers.</p>

<h3>Complex Drug Trafficking Case The District Court Will Open a Debate Court Today Involving as Many as Seventeen Defendants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The District Court yesterday tried a large-scale drug trafficking case involving as many as seventeen defendants. The first defendant, Zhu Qishan, was reported in a confidential letter from the Nantong District Court that the drug dealer Su Suiliang confessed that all the drugs were purchased from Zhu Qishan. The District Court then searched Zhu's concubines' residence and found many packages of morphine. However, Zhu claimed in court yesterday that he was a cloth merchant, and his wife, Liu Wenlan, and concubine, Zhu Decao, also denied that their husband was trafficking in drugs. The second defendant, Zhang Mingyuan, took a plane from Tianjin to Shanghai on November 9 last year, carrying a leather suitcase containing morphine. After getting off the plane, he handed the suitcase to the third defendant, Yan Dongfu, who was waiting at the airport. Yan claimed to be a retired soldier who went to the airport to greet relatives and friends and happened to see Zhang, who was an acquaintance, so they traveled together. The fourth defendant, Sun Zhicheng, the ninth defendant, Li Hongying, the tenth defendant, Zhang Gentian, the eleventh defendant, Zhang Yiren, and the twelfth defendant, Li Dingguo (who committed suicide in prison), were all from Taiwan and were all suspected of jointly trafficking in drugs, and drugs were seized. Yesterday, everyone shirked responsibility and denied the charges. The fifth defendant, Zhou Da, claimed to be a military doctor, and the sixth defendant, Ma Xiangwu, and the seventh defendant, Lv Xinquan, claimed to be legitimate businessmen who transported legitimate goods from Tianjin to Shanghai. The eighth defendant, Song Zixin (whose brother, Song Zi'an, was arrested in Tianjin for a drug case). Zhu Qishan's concubine sister, Zhang Wenying, and Kan Zhang Jianghou were also involved. This case is a combination of several cases. Because the defendants are related to each other, the drugs were transported from Tianjin to Shanghai by air, ship, and train. The District Court previously sent a letter to the Tianjin Court to assist in the investigation. The detailed reply from the Tianjin District Court has now arrived in Shanghai. The case was originally scheduled for debate yesterday, but because there were too many defendants and the trial took too long, the court ordered that the court debate be continued at 2:00 PM today.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Usury</p>
<p>Zhu Gufen asks: My relative, A, acting on behalf of his friend, B, borrowed 4 million yuan from C, D, and E. However, A's name is on the notes. Now B is bankrupt. In the past three months, in addition to paying more than 4 million yuan in interest, he still owes C, D, and E more than 1 million yuan each. A is also unable to repay the debt. He asked someone to plead with the creditors C, D, and E to stop the interest and repay the principal in installments or repay the principal by offsetting it with goods, but C and others refused. A is extremely anxious. Please advise: (1) Can A sue C, D, and E for the crime of usury? (2) Or can A file a private prosecution with the court and ask the official to order them to stop the interest and repay the principal within a time limit? (3) Can A ask a lawyer to handle the matter?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia replies] It is right to ask the creditors to stop the interest and repay the principal. If C and others refuse, and there is indeed evidence that they have taken advantage of others' urgency and inexperience, lending money and obtaining heavy interest that is obviously disproportionate to the principal, you can sue them according to law.</p>
<p>(2) Landlord's Abuse</p>
<p>Wu Ruofan asks: I am a tenant in a three-room house. Recently, the second landlord wants to increase the rent on the pretext of increased taxes, which is unreasonable. I have legal questions and would like to ask for answers: (1) Is there any explicit provision for the rent between the second landlord and the third tenant? How should it be calculated to be reasonable? (2) Can I refuse to pay the rent if the second landlord illegally increases the rent?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia replies] (1) Last year, the City Government stipulated that the rent should be calculated at 140 times the pre-war rate. (2) You cannot refuse to pay, you should deposit it according to law.</p>

<h3>Thirty Years of Shanghai Cinema</h3>
<p>Foreword: The film industry in Shanghai is currently in a difficult and pitiable situation. The economic downturn and the narrowness of the film market are undoubtedly the objective reasons for the current stagnation of the film industry. More than a year after the victory [of the war], the total number of domestically produced films is still less than twenty, and the content is so inadequate and the technical level is so insufficient that it is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Secondly, the large-scale import of foreign films is also a fatal blow to the Chinese film industry. Looking around, the film industry in Shanghai, or even in China, can be said to be completely occupied by foreign films, and 80% of the content of these foreign films is entertainment. If there is any educational significance, it is negative. How much educational awareness can you get from those embracing, detective, song and dance, and all-out action color films? This is not to say that Western film merchants are maliciously anesthetizing the Chinese people, but the more trivial the film, the more money it makes in China! The facts are obvious and need no further explanation.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the film industry itself undeniably has many subjective shortcomings. Such as the lack of talent, rudimentary equipment, and inadequate organization and management, making the film industry in Shanghai (which is actually the entire Chinese film industry) still "frail" today.</p>
<p>The film industry in Shanghai has worked hard for its cause and made considerable contributions, but it is still unable to achieve satisfactory results due to various subjective and objective constraints - especially now! However, although the environment is difficult, as pioneers in the film industry, there is absolutely no reason to shrink back and lose heart!</p>
<p>Regarding these issues, many experts and senior writers have provided many valuable opinions, which need not be repeated. What needs to be remembered is this precious history of the Shanghai film industry from its infancy to the present. The reporter does not expect this text to bring anything, but hopes to experience this true story—how the Shanghai film industry has grown.</p>
<p>The Budding Period, 1917</p>
<p>An American film merchant brought camera equipment to China, intending to engage in the film production business, but lost all of his capital of 100,000 yuan and was stranded in Shanghai. Unable to do anything, he had to sell the camera equipment and return home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press bought this equipment and film. The Commercial Press then tried to run a film production business under its photography department, hiring Ye Xiangrong, who had returned from studying in the United States, as a photographer, and produced simple newsreels, including short films such as "Commercial Press Employees Leaving Work", "Grand Funeral of Sheng Xingcun", "Red Cross Parade", and "Shanghai Burning Soil". The following year, the Commercial Press specially established a "Film Department", hiring Liao Enshou as a photographer to take scenic films and current affairs news in various scenic spots in the country. A series of films were produced, including "Lushan Scenery", "West Lake Scenery", and "Beijing Scenery". Subsequently, educational newsreels such as "Women's Gymnasium" and "Yangzhen Kindergarten" were produced as short film experiments, with considerable results.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commercial Press simply expanded the film business. Mei Lanfang's "Goddess Scattering Flowers" and "Chunxiang Teasing the Schoolboy" were also filmed on the screen. Between 1918 and 1919, costume dramas such as "Miser", "Young Master Li", "Theft in the Car", "Filial Daughter-in-Law Soup", "The Prodigal Son Returns", "Winning the Lottery", "Picking Up Gold in the Wilderness", and "Son-in-Law Celebrating Birthday" were also filmed. This was the beginning of Chinese people running and producing their own films.</p>
<p>However, before the Commercial Press, the "Asia Film Company" had already made films in Shanghai, but it was not run by Chinese people. The story is long. As early as 1909 during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty, an American named Blachere founded "Asia" in Shanghai and filmed "Empress Dowager Cixi". Until 1913, no second film was produced. Due to difficulties in maintaining it, it was transferred to the company's manager, an American named Esmil. After Esmil took over, he brought together people from the Shanghai New Drama Circle. The basic actors were Qian Huafo, Yang Runshen, and others. The first production was "Difficult Husband and Difficult Wife", directed by Zheng Zhengqiu. Later, due to the lack of film sources, it was suspended for several months. Then, "Two Hundred and Fifty", starring Qian Huafo, "Visiting the City God Temple", "Five Blessings Come to the Door", "Killing Son for Revenge", "Bicycle Accident", "Zhuangzi Splitting the Coffin", "Changban Slope", and "Shop Assistant Losing Ticket", starring Wang Xianneng and others, were completed. During the Second Revolution in the autumn, a newsreel of "Revolutionary Army Attacking the Manufacturing Bureau" was also produced. However, when the European War broke out the following year, the film source was cut off again and it was closed. Later, there was the "Huaxian Film Company", but it was a flash in the pan and closed down due to losses. This is not mentioned here.</p>
<p>At that time, one could know the content of the films just by looking at these drama titles. There was no need to talk about "technique" or "effect". Moreover, all the actors were male. The female protagonists in the films were played by male actors, wearing cheongsams, putting on rouge, and appearing on the screen in a twisted manner. Fortunately, it was still the silent film era, so there was no need to raise their voices to imitate a woman's accent.</p>
<p>The Rise of Domestic Films</p>
<p>A new turning point in the beginning of film came in the winter of 1919. Universal Pictures of the United States sent Henry to China to take scenic photos of various places. In Shanghai, he borrowed the Commercial Press's film production department as a film processing place. Because of their close contact, the Commercial Press sent Ren Pengnian and others to travel with the Universal Pictures photography team to various places in Beijing and Tianjin for half a year. During these six months, Ren Pengnian and others realized the truth about movies. They felt that the movies they had made before were really outrageous and needed to be improved. When the Universal photography team returned to the United States, they sold the camera equipment they had brought at a low price to the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>In 1920, the Commercial Press sent Yu Houpei and others to the United States to inspect the film business. After returning, they filmed "Lotus Drop" and "Righteousness Destroys Relatives". The film department of the Commercial Press did not become independent until 1926, when it was renamed Guoguang Film Company. Gradually, the film business finally raised its head and won the attention of people from all walks of life. In 1921, three new film companies were opened in Shanghai: China Film Research Institute, Shanghai Film Company, and New Asia Film Company.</p>
<p>When the China Film Research Institute was established, it coincided with the sensational case of Yan Ruisheng's murder of Wang Jianying in Shanghai. Therefore, this incident was used as the main theme, and the Commercial Press Film Department was entrusted to film "Yan Ruisheng". Ms. FF, a socialite at the time, was hired, and Yin Mingzhu played the lead role. After completion, it was rented to the Summer Palatial Grand Theater at a high price and screened for a week, and the theater was crowded. However, the China Film Research Institute ended its business as soon as it made money. The first new film of the "Shanghai Film Company" was "Sea Oath", starring Yin Mingzhu. Later, "Old Well Heavy Wave Record", starring Fu Wenai, and "Abandoned Child", starring Dan Erchun, were also filmed.</p>
<p>New Asia Company started filming "Red Powder Skull", which was the first martial arts film in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Film Companies Established One After Another</p>
<p>Here, we must mention the "Mingxing Film Company", which occupies the most important position in the Shanghai film industry. It was born in March 1922. At first, because it did not have the equipment for a photography studio, it borrowed a glass shed from a Westerner named Old Luo and used it as a photography studio to try out news and comedy short films, including "The Adventures of the King of Comedy in Shanghai", "Disturbing the Strange Theater", and "Love of Laborers". In 1923, "Orphan Saves Ancestors" was filmed, advocating inherent morality, which was praised by the audience and the business income was quite good. Where there is profit, general large and small companies have secretly proceeded.</p>
<p>In the same year, the "China Film Company" also filmed "New Nanjing" and "Idiot", but had to close down due to lack of capital.</p>
<p>The following year, film companies sprung up like mushrooms after rain, with a total of fourteen:</p>
<p>(Name) (Representative Work)</p>
<p>Great China Human Heart</p>
<p>Lily Tea Picking Girl</p>
<p>Kunlun Foot Shadow in Front of the Window</p>

<p>In 1925, another seventeen were established:</p>

<p>Great China Who is the Mother</p>
<p>Sanhuang Awakening</p>
<p>New Continent Sword Courage and Qin Heart</p>

<p>In 1926, another seventeen were established:</p>
<p>(Name) (Representative Work)</p>
<p>Guoguang Better to Return</p>
<p>Peacock Peacock Flies Southeast</p>
<p>Southern Country Go to the People</p>
<p>Diamond River of Love Tide</p>

<p>Minxin Jade Clean Ice Clean</p>
<p>Feifei Wandering Butterfly</p>
<p>Good Friend Miser</p>
<p>Three Friends Runaway Marriage</p>
<p>China First Good Widow</p>
<p>Kaiyuan Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Fair Fair Fight</p>
<p>Five Friends Good Time</p>
<p>Yanyang Down and Out Frightened Soul</p>
<p>Happy Forest Sacrifice for Friends</p>
<p>It can be imagined how vigorous the film business was at that time. From 1926 to 1936, during these ten years, film companies rose and fell, which was very lively. But only a few companies, such as Mingxing, Lianhua, Tianyi, Yihua, and Diantong, really achieved results. And some domestic film companies had no cameras, no photography studios, and even no actors. They were just a combination of three or five people who put up the name of a film company and called themselves entrepreneurs in the film industry. Therefore, although there were many film companies, the production rate of domestic films was extremely low. Taking 1935 as an example, there were a total of forty-six film companies in Shanghai that year, but the total output of films was only thirty-eight, while the total number of Western films sold that year was as many as three hundred and seventy-eight.</p>
<p>The Production of Sound Films</p>
<p>China's first sound film was Lianhua Film Company's "Wild Grass and Idle Flowers", followed by Mingxing's "Singer Red Peony" and Lianhua's "Poppy", etc., but those used wax disc sound. The "film edge sound" nearly sound film experiment was successfully tested in Shanghai in 1936. In 1931, Tianyi Film Company and Mingxing Film Company successively purchased sound film cameras and built sound film photography studios, so there were officially self-made sound films. Tianyi's first sound film was "Spring Colors of the Song Field", which was publicly screened at the New Light Grand Theater on October 29, 1931. Mingxing's first sound film was "Old Times of Beijing", which was simultaneously publicly screened at the Central and Mingxing theaters on May 12, 1932.</p>
<p>Soon, Chinese people invented their own recording machines. In 1934, Situ Huimin and others self-made a sound camera, named "Sanyou-style Recording Machine", which achieved very good results and could record sound outdoors. It won a certificate from the China Educational Film Association and a bonus of 10,000 yuan from Chairman Chiang. Sanyou then organized Changtong Film Company, and the first production was "Peach and Plum Tribulation". At that time, it is also worth mentioning that Mingxing Company once shot color films. In 1931, Mingxing Company, in view of the popularity of European and American color films, filmed a part of "Tears and Laughter" in color, but because the technology was not good and the cost was too high, it was not very successful. Later, during the Anti-Japanese War, there were also attempts, but the results were not good. Until now, we have not been able to see a complete domestic color film.</p>
<p>Before and After the War of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>In the early days of Shanghai films, martial arts films such as "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" were popular. The reason why this kind of martial arts film was popular for a while was simply to express the backward worldview of the petty bourgeoisie at that time! Later, social dramas such as "Sister Flowers" began to replace martial arts films, winning a wide audience. In fact, the dissatisfaction with reality and absurd fantasies expressed in these social dramas were no different from martial arts films, except that they were closely related to realistic social issues, and the fantasies also shed their mysterious coats. This change moved the Shanghai film scene from a mysterious tower to a crossroads, which is naturally a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>"Song of the Fishermen", which was screened for more than eighty days and whose seats were always in demand, led domestic films to penetrate the "tragedy" style, and the general audience seemed to love to watch those "joys and sorrows" plays.</p>
<p>In summary, before the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's film scene was mostly social and ethical dramas in terms of quality, and as mentioned earlier, there were many film companies but very few productions in terms of quantity.</p>
<p>What happened after the Anti-Japanese War?</p>
<p>After spending some dark days on the "isolated island", Shanghai's domestic films had undergone a fundamental change: from the struggle for "quality" to the expansion of "quantity"!</p>
<p>The expansion of quantity may be very good in general. Readers can of course remember how the domestic films at that time were surging. A "Three Smiles" could be filmed in a week, and ten films could be rushed out in a month. The output cannot be said to be small, but the content is really embarrassing! Various film companies were just desperately planning for business, grasping the general low-level audience, and did not hesitate to produce in a rough and shoddy manner, placing the content consciousness in a foreign country! Costume dramas became popular, and the story of "the fallen son wins the top prize" was all brought to the screen. There were also some detective and nonsense boring films that actually became active! Failure pessimism, predestination theory, "peace" theory, and surrender theory all met with the audience!</p>
<p>Why has the "quality" of domestic films declined so much?</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that Shanghai's domestic films do not have a sound strategy. The film business after "August 13" was done with a "try and see" mentality and did not have a strong will. Therefore, when evil forces attacked them, they began to waver and waver.</p>
<p>This fact was even more obvious after the Pacific War on December 8, 1941. The film practitioners with weak will threw themselves into the arms of the "Greater East Asia"! The Shanghai film search after the Pacific War can be summed up in one sentence: "Demons occupy a dark mass!"</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Film Industry</p>
<p>After the victory, the various factories of the "Huaying" in the enemy and puppet period in this city were taken over by the central government separately. The former Fulv Liliu Huaying Second Factory was changed to the Central Film Photography Studio Second Factory, the Zhabei Tiantong'an Road Photography Studio was the First Factory, and the former Xiafei Road Huaying Third Factory was taken over by the Political Department of the Military Commission and changed to the First Factory, and the Connaud Road was the Second Factory. After the takeover, due to talent, economy, and all kinds of difficulties, the film industry was unusually silent.</p>
<p>By the end of last year, a total of thirteen domestic films had been screened: "Loyal Family", "Frontline Storm", "Tears of Jinghua", "Holy City Record", "Orioles Fly in the World", "Dare to Die Guard Team", "Japanese Spy", "Blood Splattered Cherry Blossoms", "Reeds Turn White and Swallows Fly", "Iron Bones and Ice Heart", "Number One in the World", "The Miserable Do Not Sympathize with Each Other", and "Sparks of the Nation". About "Distant Love", "Lovesickness" and "Spring Marks on the Lake" are currently being screened, and several others are in production. Looking at this number is really pitiful, and its content and technology also have many debatable points.</p>

<h3>News Film: The World's Ears and Eyes</h3>
<p>News and film are both "the world's ears and eyes." In this 20th century, these two things finally merged and produced "news film." Currently, we can see some news short films, international or domestic, before the feature film in the cinema, so that in addition to entertainment and appreciation, we can effortlessly accept some common sense of current affairs, and its effect is even better than black words on white paper!</p>
<p>What was the first news film made in Shanghai?</p>
<p>When the Fifth Far Eastern Games were held in Hongkou Park in the summer of twenty-six years ago, the film department of the Commercial Press cooperated with Dr. Peter, the director of the film department of the YMCA, to start taking news short films at the venue. A total of three volumes were filmed: the first volume was the entry of athletes and the opening ceremony, the second volume was the finals of various sports, and the third volume was the girls' gymnastics and the scout gymnastics. These three volumes are the opening of the production of Chinese news films.</p>
<p>In 1922, General Joffre came to Shanghai for sightseeing. Joffre Road was decorated with lanterns and colors to welcome him, which was very grand. The newly established Mingxing Film Company captured the situation of welcoming Joffre into the camera as a start-up gun before Mingxing started filming.</p>
<p>The production of news films flourished after 1927. In 1930, Lianhua was established and produced "Lianhua News" every month. The Central Propaganda Committee also cooperated with Lianhua for a while to take news from various places to enrich the content, which was named "China News".</p>
<p>News films can show their great effect in wartime! Unfortunately, the citizens on the isolated island could not meet and shake hands with the anti-Japanese warriors on the screen. Only after the outbreak of the European War could they see some beacon fires on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in the British Embassy. At the same time, readers may also remember that films of Nazi self-propaganda were also being screened in the German Embassy.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to the overseas news regularly provided by the United States Information Service and several other companies, domestic news is generally produced by the China Film Factory. There has been significant progress in quality compared to the past. I wish them to work hard and make progress! And I hope that the news industry and the film industry will cooperate closely, like Hearst and MGM in the United States!</p>

<p>Among these one hundred names, there are actually only thirty-six people. In other words, there are a total of thirty-six stars who have won the throne in the ten years from 1936 to 1945. And from the above list, you can also see the ups and downs of Hollywood stars.</p>
<p>From 1936 to 1938, the first place was always occupied by child star Shirley Temple. However, due to the increase in age, she fell to fifth place in the fourth year, and then fell out of the top ten! She was replaced by Mickey Rooney, who was the "movie emperor" for three years, but he also fell in the fourth year, becoming the fourth place. In the next year, he fell to ninth place. In the top ten stars of 1944, you can't see the name of this naughty star.</p>
<p>Clark Gable, from 1936 to 1943, he was always selected among the top ten superstars every year; and Spencer Tracy, that tough star, from 1938 to 1945, except for 1943, was also repeatedly listed among the top ten stars. Among the female stars, Greer Garson and Betty Grable are also very popular, and Grable also won the championship in 1943!</p>
<p>Strangely, Abbott and Costello, these two funny stars, actually got the first place in 1942! As for Bing Crosby, he has always been promoted as the "movie emperor" recently, and his bass singing has fascinated audiences all over the world!</p>

<h3>The Central Bank Secretly Sells More Than 10,000 Taels of Gold; Gold Prices Are Powerless to Resist; Falling 190,000 Yuan Compared to Last Saturday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was still subject to the control of the Central Bank. The morning opened at 4.06 million to 4.08 million, and there was a tendency to weaken as high-priced supply sources emerged. However, the price of 3.99 million once struggled, but due to the registration and allocation relationship, buyers were slightly cautious, and the market fell back to 3.95 million. The Central Bank allocated 3,340 taels at a price of 3.96 million. After the entry of miscellaneous speculative funds and the acceptance of Jingbang [Beijing merchants], the Central Bank secretly sold more than 3,000 taels in addition to the explicit allocation. Therefore, it has never been able to re-cross the 4 million mark. Later, the saying of unlimited allocation spread, and even around 3.95 million at noon. In the afternoon, the Central Bank's buying and selling was even more vigorous, and another 6,000 taels were supplied according to the market, pushing it down to 3.87 million, and then it stabilized slightly. As a result, it fell 190,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, the price of gold jewelry still hanging at 415,000 yuan, silver dollars rose slightly, and the covert tightening of money was seen, ranging from 1.5 jiao to 2 jiao.</p>

The price of Hong Kong dollars also weakened, falling 50 yuan compared to last Saturday. There was limited actual sales of Hong Kong exchange rates. Yesterday, there were still a few transactions at 1,340 yuan.

<h3>Textile Control Commission Purchases National Cotton, Northern Jiangsu to Obtain 100,000 Dan</h3>
<p>In order to increase this year's production, the National Textile Management Committee has recently been actively purchasing cotton in the Northern Jiangsu area. However, the cotton fields in Northern Jiangsu have suffered significant losses due to the disturbances of the Communist army. Currently, it can only purchase at market prices in the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu's National Army. This cotton was originally initiated for purchase by the "Dasheng Private Textile Factory," requesting the assistance of the Textile Control Commission. The Textile Control Commission believes that assisting one private yarn factory is not as good as assisting all private yarn factories in the area, in order to be fair. Therefore, it has decided to distribute the purchased cotton equally among the "Dasheng Factory," "Factories under the China Textile Corporation," and the Yarn Industry Association. The association will then divide the allocated amount into four groups for distribution to its members. According to the person in charge of the Textile Control Commission, the amount of cotton purchased this time is not large, only about 100,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Firm First, Then Weaken; Yarn Numbers Show Eagerness to Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was firm first and then weak. The opening of the Textile Construction cargo was delayed until 11:15 a.m., causing people in the industry to arrive late. Trading in the market was extremely late. The asking price for heavy yarn was between 2.5 million and 2.6 million, and the asking price for light yarn was only 2.1 million, similar to the market at the end of last year. Unfortunately, buyers did not surge, and yarn numbers showed a strong desire to supply, causing the red market for each yarn count to show a trend of rising and then falling.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Increases by 10%; Red Market is Only an Ornament</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric red market, according to the old rules of previous years, opened on the day before yesterday (i.e., the day of the Five Road Gods of Wealth). Today, it happens to be Sunday, and due to various environmental factors, discussions among the industry to open were mutually delayed. The reporter inspected Qipan Street and various tea houses yesterday, and although there were some openings, many were unable to open and were observing and inquiring each other. Most shops were waiting for the factory to open before discussing opening, and the factories were waiting for the sales situation of the hao (号) customers before opening. Therefore, the red market price became an ornament and lacked actual transactions. Overall, the red market opened yesterday increased by an average of about 10% compared to the close at the end of last year.</p>
<h3>Private Oil Factories Started Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Yesterday, private oil factories in this city started work and should be able to distribute to retailers today. The China Vegetable Oil Company also continued to distribute as usual. The edible oil market has not yet opened due to the sluggish arrival of goods. However, the distribution of edible oil to retailers in this city is still carried out by private factories and the China Vegetable Oil Company according to the originally agreed price, and there should be no fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Asking Prices are Quite High</h3>
<p>The Lunar New Year holiday has passed quickly, and tea merchants also went to the market yesterday as usual. However, because those holding goods are firm, they hold a bullish attitude towards various red and green teas. Therefore, there are few samples, and asking prices are soaring, while buyers are afraid of high prices and are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. The overall closing situation was still good, but the red market rarely opened. According to people in the industry, during this year of construction, Chinese tea merchants, in view of the fact that Chinese tea has still not been active overseas, are still constantly planning the road to revival.</p>
<h3>China Trust Distributes Rayon; Everything Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's February distribution plan for rayon has been discussed at a meeting by the Government Material Committee, which the bureau represents. It has been decided that everything remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>Longan Turns Upward</h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of both arrivals and stocks, the spring market for longan is tight. Xinghua opened at 580,000 yuan for 4 yuan, Quanzhou Dabao at 480,000 yuan, Tong'an Jikui at 460,000 yuan, and large slices to 730,000 yuan. The official red market will not open until the beginning of next month, and it is still expected to be tight.</p>
<h3>Holders Unwilling to Sell; Silk Red Market Rises Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk red market generally saw gains. Rayon No. 12; the Dongyang brand of zero had only one box open yesterday, priced at 3.6 million yuan. The Gaoshan brand was about 450,000 yuan shorter. The highest bid was over 700,000 yuan, but silk factories have not started work, and there are allocations, so there is no absorption and the market is small. Factory agents lack supply and cannot open. Stocks in the market are very low, so holders are unwilling to sell. The asking price for C-grade is 5.5 million yuan, D-grade is 400,000 yuan, ordinary five-dan is 200,000 yuan, another dan is 5 million yuan, and dried warp five-dan goods are 3.5 million yuan. The market price is roughly as above, but there were no transactions. Asking prices in the silk market are 10% to 20% higher than last year, and buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, with no transactions all day.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Discusses Opening Red Market</h3>
<p>White tung oil has been subject to foreign exchange restrictions, and there has been no domestic development for several months. Although there were several improvements at the end of last year and before the final settlement, those in this industry were not interested, because domestic sales, no matter how sharp, are always limited by the number of sales and are not enough to exert their ambitions. Hongjiang tung oil is a product sold domestically and cannot be compared with white tung oil, but because of cost considerations, it only echoes along. Yesterday, the red market for Hongjiang white tung oil was opened (see the market price column).</p>
<h3>Importers Currently Feel Three Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a person in charge of the import and export industry, there are currently three difficulties in importing goods that are not easy to solve, which greatly affect the business of most import and export firms. These difficulties are: (1) For orders placed with foreign countries before the establishment of the Import Administration Committee, but without opening foreign exchange, the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department will not approve the subsequent application for foreign exchange; (2) It is very difficult to request an extension for goods that have opened foreign exchange but have not yet been loaded on the ship after the expiration date; (3) Goods that were allowed to be imported before the establishment of the Import Administration Committee but without the supply of foreign exchange, such as fruits, cosmetics, etc., are currently mostly restricted or prohibited due to slow arrival. In addition, many industrial raw materials, such as pigments, etc., even if they are included in the list of unlimited imports, are still in short supply. Now, including them in the list of limited imports is enough to affect the development of China's industry. It is deeply hoped that the Import Administration Committee will improve all of these.</p>
<h3>Import Temporary Management Committee Solicits Broad Opinions; Enlists Experts from Various Industries for Cooperation</h3>
<p>Imported Goods Also Have Expert Advisors in Groups</p>

<h3>Chinese Medicine Market Quiet; Medicinal Materials Industry Reduces Scope</h3>
<p>The Chinese medicine market is affected by the tight money supply in Hong Kong and the feeling is the same in various other ports, affecting the sales of various goods. The market is very sluggish. The New Year's red market has not yet opened, and old prices are temporarily used to celebrate the season. The medicinal slices in this city need to wait for the Lantern Festival before stocking up, and the water passengers from other ports also need to wait for the Lantern Festival to arrive. The current market atmosphere is quiet. It is predicted that there will be a lot of activity after the Lantern Festival. Yesterday, the red market for musk was set: Yishengde 178,000, Xieshengquan 178,000, and Du brand 180,000.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the medicinal materials industry, affected by the depression, has mostly reduced its scope, laid off personnel, and cut expenses. Therefore, there are quite a few unemployed, creating an unprecedented record in the medicinal materials industry.</p>
<h3>Special Rotating Audit Team Audits the Use of Loan Funds by Various Factories; Li Lixia, Chief Auditor of the Central Bank, is Chairman</h3>
<p>With the assistance of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Joint Savings Society has lent to more than 40 small factories in this city. It is learned that in order to understand whether the loaned companies are using the loans for proper purposes, the authorities have organized a rotating audit team to inspect and audit various manufacturers separately. The team is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building to discuss the method of conducting work. It is reported that the rotating audit team has a total of 20 members, with Li Lixia, chief auditor of the Central Bank, as chairman. The rest are jointly composed of two members each from the four banks of the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, and the China Trust Bureau, three members each from commercial banks and money shops, and three members from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As soon as the approved loans are released, the work will begin.</p>
<h3>American Rice to Supply and Sell to Our Country this Spring; 240,000 Tons Available</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Negotiating Joint Purchase with the Ministry of Food</p>
<p>It is reported that the United States has 245,000 tons of rice available for sale to our country this spring, of which 12,000 tons are produced locally in the United States, and the remaining 233,000 tons are shipped to the United States from Southeast Asia and other places. Currently, our country is purchasing 90,000 tons of American rice through the Executive Yuan, totaling US$160,000, and the Ministry of Food is also purchasing 90,000 tons, accounting for two-thirds of the total. The remaining one-third is reportedly being negotiated by the Executive Yuan with the Ministry of Food, or it may be jointly purchased by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry.</p>

<h3>Rescuing the Domestic Tobacco Industry</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance has Adopted the Suggestions of the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and Industry previously requested three items to save the crisis of domestic tobacco: (1) No foreign exchange should be supplied to tobacco importers; (2) Customs anti-smuggling work should be strengthened to prevent tobacco smuggling; (3) The tariff rate for tobacco imports should be increased. It is recently learned that the Ministry of Finance has adopted these suggestions. The first item is because the amended provisional measures for import and export trade announced on November 17 last year have stipulated that the quota system applies to the import of tobacco leaves and stems, and the import of cigarettes is temporarily suspended. The Provisional Administrative Committee for Imports and Exports is now transferring the application to the relevant government bodies for overall review and handling. For the second item, customs has been instructed to strengthen inspection work and strictly enforce the ban. For the third item, it is agreed to use it as a reference when revising import tax rates.</p>
<h3>Bayer and Defu Factories to be Reorganized into Limited Companies</h3>
<p>After the former enemy property Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory and Defu Pigment Factory were taken over and liquidated by the former Enemy Property Management Bureau, there were not many remaining stocks after multiple auctions and tenders. The government authorities believe that these factories have a long history in the world market and our country's market and are valued by pigment and pharmaceutical merchants in various countries. Therefore, they do not intend to close them down and ordered them to be reorganized into limited companies. It is heard that the liquidation office of the factory has received this order and is currently starting the reorganization. It is expected to be formally established in early March this year.</p>
<h3>Northeast Economic Commission Plans to Establish Soybean Inspection Institute for Export</h3>
<p>[Shenyang News] Northeast specialty soybeans, with an annual output of 4 million tons, have always been a major export commodity. After the victory, the Central Trust Bureau handled the transportation and sale to foreign countries. However, because there is no commodity inspection equipment in the Northeast, in order to maintain the qualified standard of export goods, it is necessary to transfer them to Shanghai and go through the inspection procedures before they can be exported, which is very troublesome. In order to support the export of Northeast specialty soybeans and make them meet the standards, the Economic Committee of the Northeast Executive Headquarters plans to establish an export soybean inspection institute in Siping, Kaiyuan and other places, with four inspection stations. It is heard that the director of the institute will be concurrently held by Chen, director of the Business Department of the Economic Committee, and the deputy director will be concurrently held by the director of the Shenyang Agriculture and Forestry Department.</p>
<h3>Food Prices Soar; Much Rationing, and Arrivals are Strong; Off-Market Transactions Still Exceed Price Limits; Other Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, etc. All Rise</h3>
<p>Today, the North and South markets are all open. A total of about 15,000 shi of rice arrived. Saigon rice is rationed without restrictions. It is heard that a total of 12,300 packages were rationed out, priced at 63,000 yuan, plus commission fees. However, high-quality early indica rice is expensive due to the high prices in the producing areas, and people's sentiments are excited, soaring by 5,6000 yuan. Bai Yuan Yin Yuan also rose by 6,7000 yuan. Therefore, off-market prices are very different from the deliberated prices, so very few transactions are concluded. Only Zhongguan South japonica rice is still within the deliberated price range. All others exceed price limits. Miscellaneous grains and oil cakes are rising uniformly. The oil market lacks trading in raw soybean oil because inland areas are soaring. Only small cart sesame oil has a slight volume of transactions, and the price also jumps by 20,000 yuan. Flour and bran have both risen sharply by 23,000 yuan. Soybean cakes are selling very well in Shantou and Taiwan, soaring by more than 2,000 yuan. Mung beans have increased by 23,000 yuan, and red beans have followed suit with an increase of 12,000 yuan. Corn and broad beans have both increased by 12,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories in this street are very eager to purchase, increasing by 23,000 yuan. Sesame has increased by 12,000 yuan. Raw peanuts have active sales in Guangzhou, increasing sharply by 56,000 yuan. Wheat is a rare commodity, with no arrivals at all, and inquiries are high.</p>
<h3>Although Autumn Silk Has Been Purchased by the Government, the Difficulties of Manufacturers Have Not Been Reduced</h3>
<p>Difficult to Be Effective without a Fundamental Plan</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] More than 2,700 dan of autumn silk, after President Song approved that autumn silk 78 points D grade be priced at 6,326,400 yuan per dan, and dried cocoons be priced at 5,767,540 yuan per dan, for government purchase, have been delivered to the China Sericulture Company for verification by manufacturers, reaching 880 dan as of yesterday. Among these, 655 dan are autumn silk, and 225 dan are dried cocoons. In fact, a total of 560 dan have been delivered to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase, of which 395 dan are autumn silk and 165 dan are dried cocoons. It is heard that there is currently no time limit for the government's purchase of autumn silk, and it is purchased as it arrives.</p>
<p>According to sources, the government's approved purchase price for autumn silk will hopefully prevent losses for manufacturers with well-equipped facilities, excellent technology, and meticulous management. Unfortunately, 80% of manufacturers are limited by working capital, and most of their own 30% advance payments for spring cocoon loans are discounted from high-interest loans. Therefore, the result of hard work producing with low-interest loans is all paid to high-interest loans, so there is no talk of profit. Moreover, many manufacturers have spent a great deal of money on repairing and building factories, and it is even more difficult to talk about profits. It is predicted that the government will formulate another fundamental plan to support the silk industry this year, which will generally follow three approaches: (1) simplifying loan procedures, (2) increasing the amount of loans, (3) implementing strict management.</p>
<h3>Industrial Loan Review Committee Continues Investigation Work</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Provisional Review Committee for Industrial Enterprise Loans of the Joint Savings Society has accepted many more applications. Due to the urgent time, they have not been completed. Now the valley factories have started work one after another. The prior investigation work has been continuing as usual from today.

It is also reported that the members of the Review Committee have been meeting three times a week in recent months. They have also been meeting as usual on Sundays and New Year's Eve, working extremely hard. President Song held a banquet on the 25th at the Bank of China Building on the third floor to entertain and comfort them. Xu Baiyuan, Huo Baoshu, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiyin, Qin Runqing, Liu Gongyun, Lin Fengbao, Gu Chunfan, etc. attended. The President expressed great satisfaction with the committee's work in the past few weeks and offered words of encouragement.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Issue of Increased Tuition Fees for This Semester: Private School Teachers Petitioned Yesterday; Mayor Wu Believes Current Fees Should Follow the Senate Resolution; Speaker Pan Promises to Raise the Issue for Reconsideration During the Next General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The current tuition fee standards for private primary and secondary schools, as resolved by the Municipal Senate's second general assembly, pose a significant threat to the livelihoods of teachers. In addition to publishing a declaration in the newspaper a few days ago, they also petitioned the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Education, and the Municipal Senate yesterday.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government: Personally Delivering a Petition to the Mayor</p>
<p>Representatives from 72 private primary and secondary schools in the city, totaling more than 500 people, gathered at New Huanzhong School at 10:00 AM yesterday. They traveled in six large trucks and arrived at the Municipal Government at 10:45 AM. They selected 21 representatives, including Zhang Guangzong from Tongyi Middle School, Xu Kaifu from Mingde Girls' School, Pan Zhisun from Kunfan Girls' School, Zhou Shixuan from Ningbo Sixth Primary School, Sun Chengqie from Chengdong Middle School, Zhang Weixin from Minli Middle School, Wang Gengyang from Daozhong Girls' School, Zhu Yagao from Tonghui Primary School, Gao Mingdong from Chongshi Middle School, and Gu Xudong from Zhouyao Middle School, to meet with Mayor Wu and personally deliver a petition.</p>
<p>The Mayor's Opinion</p>
<p>Mayor Wu appeared at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 11:00 AM. He first expressed his deep concern for the difficult living conditions of private school teachers in the city but noted two conflicting concerns: (1) While the teachers' lives are indeed difficult, the burden on parents must also be considered. (2) If private school tuition fees are repeatedly increased, municipal schools will inevitably be eclipsed. The resulting disparity in treatment will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among municipal school teachers and put the Municipal Government in a difficult position. The Senate considered this matter repeatedly and handled it with great care. Furthermore, the Senate is a representative body of the people, and all its resolutions should be respected. He suggested that all schools currently comply with the Senate's resolution on fees. If there are other difficulties, they can submit a written request, listing the total number of students, revenue and expenditure situation, a comparison of pre-war tuition fees, and the teachers' actual living difficulties, through normal channels, to the competent authority for review and then forwarded to the Senate for deliberation. Mayor Wu also emphasized that educators are leaders of intellectuals, and all actions must comply with the law and be based on facts, not just theoretical arguments. Mayor Wu immediately stated that he has always valued education and promised that when the Senate reconvenes, he will definitely argue their case based on reason.</p>
<p>Representatives' Opinions</p>
<p>After the Mayor finished speaking, representatives Zhang Guangzong, Xu Kaifu, and others spoke in succession, stating the purpose of their petition was purely to stabilize the lives of teachers. They said that many private schools in the city still have non-transparent finances, making it difficult to achieve reasonable adjustments to teacher salaries. Therefore, they hoped that the authorities would thoroughly implement these regulations, requiring all private schools to fully disclose their finances, and ensuring the teachers' job security, as many schools often dismiss teachers who inquire about school finances.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Mayor Wu stated that school financial transparency must be realized to ensure that the increased tuition fees are used to improve teacher salaries. He will also strongly support job security and will not tolerate such phenomena. Teachers can organize investigation teams to report such cases according to the law, and the Municipal Government will be responsible for handling them. He will instruct the relevant authorities to draft detailed regulations on how to supervise the finances of each school and implement them strictly. As it was already 12:00 PM, the representatives, to express their gratitude, bowed to Mayor Wu and then took the original trucks to petition the Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Bureau of Education: Three Requests Made</p>
<p>The delegation arrived at the Bureau of Education at 12:15 PM, and the entire group gathered in the square in front of the Bureau of Education, where they were received by the Director of the Bureau of Education, Gu Yuxiu. Four representatives, including Wang Luzhi, presented three requests to Director Gu: (1) On behalf of the school principals: requesting an increase in tuition fees; (2) Subsidizing private school finances; (3) On behalf of the teachers: private school authorities should make their finances transparent.</p>
<p>The Director's Opinion</p>
<p>Director Gu replied separately: (1) Private school tuition fees will temporarily be implemented according to the Senate's resolution, but a reconsideration can be requested; (2) Subsidies for private school finances have been included in the budget, but the Finance Bureau has not yet issued them; (3) Financial transparency for private schools is the responsibility of private school principals. The representatives were generally satisfied and then left the Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Senate: Requesting Increased Education Funding</p>
<p>At 1:15 PM yesterday afternoon, the representatives went to the Municipal Senate to petition. Fourteen representatives, including Xu Kaifu from Mingde Girls' School, Zhang Guangzong from Tongyi Middle School, and Pan Zhisun from Kunfan Girls' School, went upstairs to the Senate building and presented their opinions to Speaker Pan. The key points of the representatives' requests are summarized as follows: (1) Requesting regulations on hourly wages to increase teacher salaries; (2) Thoroughly implementing the order for private schools to make their finances transparent, protecting teachers' jobs; (3) If private school revenue is indeed insufficient to cover expenses, then tuition fees should be appropriately increased, but to the extent possible, they still do not advocate for increasing tuition fees; (4) Requesting an increase in the municipal budget for education to 35 percent; (5) How will the 50,000,000 yuan subsidy be allocated? (6) Regarding the increase in teacher salary standards, please convey it to the education authorities for immediate planning and implementation.</p>
<p>The Speaker's Opinion</p>
<p>Speaker Pan immediately stated to the representatives: The Senate absolutely sympathizes with the meager salaries of teachers. The teachers' declaration in the newspapers stating that the Senate disregards the difficult lives of teachers is not true. At the same time, he mentioned the question of whether the Municipal Senate has the right to regulate private school tuition fees, which seems excessive and irresponsible. At the same time, this proposal was submitted by the Mayor for discussion at the General Assembly, and the General Assembly should at least make a conclusion to reply to the Municipal Government. During this meeting, he also tried his best to sympathize with the teachers. If the General Assembly had immediately resolved the matter, the proposal to increase tuition fees would not have been passed. It was specially postponed to the second day for further discussion, and as a result, it was slightly increased. However, if a proposal passed by the Senate must be overturned, it should first be reconsidered, and currently, it can only be implemented according to the resolution method. The second General Assembly has not yet ended, and he is responsible for raising the issue for reconsideration when it convenes, but he cannot guarantee that it will definitely pass. At the same time, he hopes that the schools will provide actual materials, such as the schools' actual revenue and expenditure, to be reported to the General Assembly; otherwise, there will be no basis. He heard that the teachers were attacking one or two senators who opposed the increase in tuition fees, which seems inappropriate. The education community should assist the government in promoting democratic politics and cultivate good social practices, and this attitude is not entirely satisfactory. Speaker Pan then went downstairs to express the same opinions to other representatives and promised to raise the issue for reconsideration at the General Assembly before the representatives gradually left.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Will Convene a Meeting with Private School Principals Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mayor Wu has scheduled to convene a meeting with principals of private primary and secondary schools throughout the city at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 29th) to provide instructions on tuition fee standards and the issue of private school financial transparency.</p>

<h3>Tangshan Institute of Technology: Professor Shortage</h3>
<p>President Gu Goes to Beijing to Appeal</p>
<p>[Our Report, Tianjin Airmail] Since its restoration, Tangshan Institute of Technology has faced numerous difficulties, especially the shortage of school funds and the meager salaries of professors, which are major obstacles to the institute's development. Considering the precarious future, all faculty and students unanimously requested President Gu Yisun to go to Beijing as soon as possible to appeal to the Ministry of Education and request a solution to the current difficulties. It is reported that Gu has already departed for Beijing. Since the institute was approved for restoration last spring, it has only received more than 700 million yuan in restoration and construction funds, most of which was used for travel expenses, and the remainder was spent on repairing school buildings and adding desks. The equipment has not yet been restored due to lack of funds. Furthermore, the salaries of professors are lower than those in Tianjin and Beijing, leading to the resignation of some professors, creating an unprecedented shortage of professors in the institute's 43-year history. The institute's monthly expenses are only 4 million yuan, which is half of what is actually needed, making it impossible to advance any work. During his trip to Beijing, Gu will also consult with alumni associations in Beijing and Shanghai to discuss the institute's future survival, purchasing equipment, hiring professors, and resolving funding issues, which will be the focus of discussion. The students have high hopes for the alumni in Beijing and Shanghai and believe that Gu's trip will be successful.</p>
<h3>Students of Shaanxi North Road National School Temporarily Attend Other Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Bureau of Education is facing the urgent need to determine and resolve the aftermath of the fire on Shaanxi North Road during the Lunar New Year, which completely destroyed the nearby Municipal National School, affecting 679 students and 30 teachers, as well as the issue of school opening next semester. In addition to allocating a temporary relief fund of 2 million yuan, the bureau has also requested 200 million yuan from the Municipal Council to build a new school building. In the meantime, a temporary opening plan has been drafted to allow students to temporarily attend classes at the Singapore Fourth National School and the Shiyan Public School in the district after school hours until the new school building is completed. The bureau has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today to invite the principals of the aforementioned schools to discuss and decide on the proposed plan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Scheduled to Convene Meeting of Public School Directors</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Bureau of Education is scheduled to convene a meeting of directors and teachers of municipal public schools at the Municipal Public Education Experimental School at 3:00 PM on February 1 to discuss the implementation plan for public education in the upcoming semester.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Adjustment of National Education Experimental Zone in This City, Presenting Six Key Points for Adjustment</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the experimental research on national education, the Ministry of Education has ordered the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to make appropriate adjustments to the establishment of the National Education Experimental Zone in this city. The National Education Experimental Zone originally designated by the Municipal Kindergarten Normal School will be directly supervised by the Bureau of Education starting in January 36th year. However, the Municipal Kindergarten Normal School and the Municipal Normal School should still be responsible for guidance regarding experimental research work. The key points for adjustment are as follows: (1) The name will be changed to the Shanghai National Education Experimental Zone. (2) Zone Address: The address of the Experimental Zone will be submitted to the Ministry for record after it has been selected. (3) General Facilities: In addition to undertaking specific experimental research work, the Experimental Zone also has a demonstration role. The establishment of central national schools and national schools within the zone, the enrichment of school content, the collection of funds, the improvement of teacher quality and the increase of salary and welfare, as well as schools assisting in promoting local autonomy and running social education, should all be completed in advance in accordance with regulations. (4) Experimental Questions: In addition to instructing on (1) curriculum, (2) teaching materials and methods, and (3) guidance for teacher training as the central experimental questions, the bureau may also formulate experimental research questions based on actual needs and implement them after reporting to the Ministry for approval. (5) Funding: In addition to fundraising by the bureau, the central government will also provide appropriate subsidies for the Experimental Zone. (6) Plan Budget: The bureau will detail the implementation plan and budget for the 36th year based on the above points and submit it to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Dagong Vocational School Reduces Tuition Fees and Raises School Funds Separately</h3>
<p>Dagong Vocational School on Emei Road in this city will reduce tuition fees for this semester. In addition to all students in the Intermediate Technical Department enjoying publicly funded treatment, the tuition fees for students in other departments will also be charged at the lowest possible rate to reduce the burden on students' parents. The school's expenses are huge, and the shortfall has been addressed by Principal Xu Heng, who has formulated a production plan to allocate the income from production operations to the school's recurring expenses. However, once the production department starts, it will need a lot of assistance, and it is said that the school deeply hopes that the government authorities will provide strong assistance.</p>

<h3>Badminton Doubles Tournament: Yucai Defeats Tiyun</h3>
<p>In the first league organized by the Badminton Committee of the Municipal Sports Association, the Group A doubles match between Yucai and Tiyun was held at the Municipal Sports Qing Gymnasium at 6:00 PM yesterday. The match was originally scheduled to be held on Lunar New Year's Day, but was changed to last night due to the holiday. The audience gradually increased because both Yucai and Tiyun were competing for second place in the first week of Group A. The match was very intense. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>In the first doubles match, Zeng Hongran and Huang Lixin of Yucai played against An Wei and Balun of Tiyun. As a result of the competition, An Wei and Balun relied on fierce spikes and won with scores of 15-14, 13-15, and 15-6.</p>

<p>In the last group, Wu Guotao and Si Chuanlong of Yucai faced Fugenxun and Sabashi of Tiyun. After the start of the game, the foreign generals violently attacked, but Wu was unusually steady and counterattacked the attackers. As a result, Yucai finally defeated Tiyun with scores of 15-3, 10-15, and 15-8. In total, Yucai won 5-4.</p>
<h3>European Table Tennis Championships</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] After defeating Switzerland, the British team will compete against France in Paris on the 14th of next month for the European Men's Table Tennis Championship.</p>

<h3>Glorious January 28th - Reflections on the 15th Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>January 28th, 1932, under the increasingly aggressive oppression of Japanese imperialists, the Chinese nation issued a world-shaking roar; this was the "January 28th" battle that shines in history books.</p>
<p>At that time, Japan had already forcibly occupied the Northeast and continued to invade our territory, intending to realize its so-called "continental policy." On one hand, it used the excuse of the monk assault incident, fabricating facts and making harsh demands on our government. While the two sides were in negotiations, taking advantage of our lack of preparation, they mobilized troops to violently attack Shanghai, bombing with airplanes and shelling with artillery. The essence of both places was reduced to ashes!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army made the arrogant statement that "it would only take four hours to completely resolve the Chinese army." However, after our troops stationed in Shanghai bravely resisted, using tens of thousands of isolated troops to confront the massive sea, land, and air military power of the stubborn enemy, they actually persisted for a full thirty-four days. This cannot but be said to be a miracle. The main reason for creating this "miracle" was entirely due to the people and the army uniting as one, fighting together with one heart.</p>
<p>As long as we are not forgetful, we can definitely recall the enthusiastic and harmonious scene of the military and the people at that time. Even ordinary weak women and young children rose up to organize rescue teams and comfort teams. In addition to running around fundraising, young students also wrote countless letters of comfort to the soldiers at the front lines. Laborers who were poorly clothed and fed also donated their hard-earned money as military pay. The generous and passionate spirit of resistance filled the hearts of people in Shanghai and hundreds of millions of people across the country.</p>
<p>In this battle, our country's losses were naturally great. All the large and small stations in Shanghai and the surrounding areas were bombed and destroyed. Production and cultural institutions such as the Commercial Press, the Oriental Library, Sanyou Industrial Company, Wing On Textile Factory, Jinan University, Fudan University, Chih Tze University, Tongji University, and Labor University were mostly destroyed by the fierce artillery fire. The loss of people's lives and property was even impossible to accurately estimate. This was the first large-scale massacre carried out by Japan in the heart of our country in decades of invading China, and it was also the initial awakening of the Chinese nation, which had suffered endless oppression.</p>
<p>The "January 28th" Shanghai Battle lasted for thirty-four days. Because the isolated army did not receive reinforcements and ran out of ammunition, at that time, under the sad and indignant mood of "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens," a humiliating "Shanghai Armistice Agreement" was signed with the enemy. However, precisely because we could endure humiliation and fight hard, after this historical test, we achieved a comprehensive victory thereafter.</p>
<p>Before the victory, "January 28th" was regarded as a "National Humiliation Memorial Day." Today, this great shame has been washed away. We are welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of "January 28th" amidst the sound of firecrackers during this abolished lunar New Year. The profound significance is self-evident.</p>
<p>The Chinese people will never forget "January 28th" and will always maintain the traditional fighting spirit to strive to eliminate any foreign insults in the future!</p>
<h3>The Climate of Beijing and Shanghai This Month</h3>
<p>— Special Contribution from Our Newspaper Contributor Zhou Zhengding, from the Capital</p>
<p>The monthly average temperature in Nanjing and Shanghai is above twenty degrees Celsius for five months (May to September) or four months (June to September); it is between ten and twenty degrees Celsius for three months (April, October, November) or four months (plus May); and it is below ten degrees Celsius but above zero degrees Celsius for four months such as December, January, February, and March. Its climate indeed has significant subtropical characteristics. However, because it is located on the east coast of the Eurasian continent, the difference in temperature between the sea and land in winter and summer causes the air pressure to rise and fall, resulting in the phenomenon of alternating monsoons. The winter monsoon originates from Siberia and often invades southeastward. Its nature is cold, dry, and prone to explosions, so the winter temperature in Beijing and Shanghai is lower than in other places at the same latitude. January is only around three degrees Celsius, and the lowest can even drop below minus ten degrees Celsius. Whenever a cold wave erupts and moves southward, there are often fierce north winds and mixed rain and snow, and the cold is piercing. In summer, the monsoon comes from the southeast sea. The temperature is high and the humidity is heavy, and the weather in Beijing and Shanghai is extremely hot and humid. The average temperature in July in both places is above twenty-seven degrees Celsius, and the highest can even reach over forty degrees Celsius. The weather is monotonous and has little change, which is truly unbearable. The weather in Beijing and Shanghai has the most changes in late spring and early autumn. There are many gales in late spring, and there are many typhoons in early autumn. Gales mostly originate from the front of inland cold and warm air currents. Their path generally goes from west to east, or from southwest to northeast. When they pass through, there is often continuous rain for days. The plum rain in June is caused by frequent gales passing through. During the plum rain season, rainfall accounts for a quarter of the total annual rainfall, which is very important for rice cultivation. Typhoons originate from the tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and are most prevalent in late summer and early autumn. They often attack from the southeast to the northwest. Storms and rain often follow, often causing major disasters and harming fishing and navigation, which can be described as devastating. However, the lingering heat of summer is often swept away, and the weather suddenly turns cool, which is also beneficial to the residents of Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>In terms of annual rainfall, Nanjing is slightly inland, so it is clearly less than Shanghai. The average annual rainfall in Nanjing is 978 millimeters, while Shanghai reaches 1128 millimeters. However, the distribution of each month is roughly similar, concentrated in the spring and summer seasons. The rainfall in Nanjing in the three months of summer (June, July, and August) accounts for 42% of the total annual rainfall, and the rainfall in one spring season (March, April, and May) accounts for 24%. The monthly rainfall in Shanghai in summer accounts for 41% of the total annual rainfall, and the rainfall in spring accounts for 24%. The total reaches about 65%. The whole year only autumn is the sunniest, with high skies and crisp air, warm sun and gentle breezes, and it has the reputation of a small spring.</p>
<p>January: Wax plum blossoms begin to open, winter jasmine begins to bloom</p>
<p>This month is the coldest time in Beijing and Shanghai. The Siberian high pressure covers the whole country, and its power is extremely strong. It often drives cold waves to erupt and move southward. When its front passes through, the air pressure rises sharply and the temperature drops suddenly. The north wind howls, the soil freezes, the cold scrapes the skin, and the amount of frost and snow is the most of any month of the year. The monthly average temperature is around three degrees Celsius, and the extreme minimum in Nanjing has reached minus 13.8 degrees Celsius (January 27, 1933), and Shanghai has also reached minus 12.1 degrees Celsius (January 19, 1893). However, because the two places are near the coast, the absolute maximum can also reach about 20 degrees Celsius due to occasional regulation by the oceanic airflow. The 21st to 25th of the month is the coldest time in Nanjing, with a five-day average of one degree Celsius. The coldest time in Shanghai is from the 16th to the 20th, with a five-day average temperature of three degrees Celsius. The rainfall in this month is only slightly more than in December, ranking second among the months with the least rainfall. The average in Nanjing is 38 millimeters, and Shanghai is 50 millimeters. The number of rainy days is slightly higher than in the previous three months, averaging nine days. Also, because it is often under the control of high pressure, there are many sunny days, averaging about eight days. However, there is a lot of dust in the city (the amount of dust in this month is more than in any other month), and the ground radiation is very strong on sunny nights. There is often fog in the low air, and the visibility is not far (the visibility is the smallest). There are an average of four or five days of thick fog per month. The sunshine on sunny days is not strong, and the amount of evaporation is the smallest of all months. In the middle of the month, the wax plum blossoms begin to bud, and in the last ten days of the month, the winter jasmine begins to bloom.</p>
<p>February: Winter jasmine in full bloom, plum blossoms begin to flower</p>
<p>The average temperature in both places this month is around four degrees Celsius, slightly higher than in January, but slightly lower than in December. It is still a cold winter period. The extreme minimum has dropped to eight and a half degrees (Beijing, February 1, 1925; Shanghai, February 2, 1910). The highest temperature can reach 25 to 28 degrees. After the 20th, the severe cold in both places has decreased. The amount of cloud and humidity in this month are the highest of the three winter months, so the sunshine time is less than in the previous month. Rainfall has increased slightly, averaging 46 millimeters in Nanjing and 60 millimeters in Shanghai. The most rainfall is about three times the average. There are nine to ten rainy days, and frost and snow gradually decrease. Thunderstorms are already possible. The wind direction is still mostly north and north-northeast, but its frequency is less than in the previous month. The average wind speed is gradually increasing. In the middle of the month, the plum blossoms begin to flower, and the winter jasmine is in full bloom.</p>
<p>March: Spring returns to the earth, willows turn green and peaches turn red</p>
<p>This month is the transition period from winter to spring. The temperature difference is the greatest. If the average temperature of each pentad (five days per pentad) is ten degrees, then the beginning of spring in Nanjing is on the 17th of the month, and the beginning of spring in Shanghai is on the 27th. The average temperature for the whole month is eight to nine degrees. Although it is warmer than in the three winter months, it is two to three degrees lower than in late autumn (November). The amount of cloud is less than in the two months before and after, the relative humidity is the smallest of the whole year, and the sunshine is more than in the two months before and after. Rainfall has increased slightly, averaging 62 millimeters in Nanjing and 83 millimeters in Shanghai. There are ten to twelve rainy days. The competition between winter and summer monsoons is fierce, making it the windiest time of the year. It is suitable for the custom of flying kites. Every time a strong northwest wind rises, dust flies and obscures the sky. The number of hazy days is the highest of all months. Although the wind direction is still mostly north-northeast, the percentage of east-southeast wind is already enough to compete with it. The average snow season in Nanjing ends on the 10th of the month, and the frost days end on the 19th. The end date in Shanghai is similar and slightly flatter. In the middle of the month: the peaches begin to flower, the willows begin to leaf. In the last ten days of the month: the frogs begin to croak, the geese are rarely seen, the redbud begins to flower, the kites fly and the fish leap, gradually opening the beginning of the spring scene.</p>
<p>April: Silkworm month, mulberry branches, willow catkins flying</p>
<p>It is now mid-spring. Following the fierce battle between the winter and summer monsoons last month, the wind is still strong. The east and east-southeast winds are the most prevalent. The average monthly temperature is around fourteen degrees Celsius. Compared with October in mid-autumn, it is still three to four degrees lower. The highest temperature in both places has reached over thirty-three degrees Celsius, and the lowest has dropped to around negative one degree Celsius. The passage of gales is most frequent this month, and rainfall is abundant, averaging between 93 and 97 millimeters, second only to the months of June, July, August (and September), ranking fourth (or fifth). The so-called "welcoming plum rain" is at this time. Shanghai has the most foggy days in this month. There are eleven to twenty-three rainy days, and the amount of precipitation time is the most of the whole year. In the first ten days of the month: the redbud is in full bloom, and the peaches and plums are in early bloom. In the middle of the month: willow catkins fly, and swallows chirp on the beams. In the last ten days of the month: orioles sing in the branches, spring shines everywhere, and spring colors fill the fields.</p>
<p>May: Barley ripens, paulownia leaves grow lush</p>
<p>This month is the time when the frequency of southeast and east-southeast winds is the highest. The breeze is gentle, and the average monthly temperature in both places is already between nineteen and twenty degrees Celsius. In Nanjing, the weather in the first and middle ten days of the month is still late spring, and the last ten days have already entered summer. The starting period of summer in Shanghai is still on the 10th of the next month (both use the average temperature of each pentad greater than twenty-two degrees as the standard for entering summer). This month, the gale has the opportunity to trend along the lower reaches of the Yellow River, so there is less rain in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The rainfall (averaging 79 millimeters in Beijing and 93 millimeters in Shanghai) and the number of rainy days (10 days in Beijing and 12 days in Shanghai) are less than in the two months before and after. The amount of cloud decreases and the sunshine increases greatly. This month is the most suitable for travel. In the first ten days of the month: the cherries ripen, and the cuckoos chirp for the first time. In the middle of the month: the paulownia leaves are lush. In the last ten days of the month: the pomegranates begin to flower, and it is time to harvest wheat and plant rice.</p>
<p>June: After the lilac flowers bloom, the plums ripen</p>
<p>This month is unusually cloudy and humid, and heavy rain occurs frequently. The average rainfall in Nanjing is 156 millimeters, ranking second among all months in the country, with a maximum of 407 millimeters (1915). The average rainfall in Shanghai is 176 millimeters, ranking first among all months in the country, with a maximum of 492 millimeters (1875). It is now the time when the plums are ripening, so it is called "plum rain". There are twelve to fourteen rainy days. Mangzhong is in the farmland, and the autumn harvest depends entirely on the plum rain for its moistening. However, when the plum rain is in season, dark clouds often cover the sky, humidity increases greatly, sunshine decreases sharply, all things grow moldy, which is unpleasant. The average temperature this month is 23 to 24 degrees Celsius, and the highest can reach 38 to 39 degrees Celsius, which is less than in July. At the beginning of the month: the phoenix trees begin to flower. In the middle of the month: the pomegranate flowers are in full bloom. At the end of the month: cicadas chirp in tall trees, green mountains are vast, and green shade fills the fields.</p>
<p>July: Cuckoos begin to leave, lotus breezes arrive slowly</p>
<p>Midsummer is in season, with hot winds and summer rain. In the first ten days of the month, the temperature is lower because the plum rain has not yet ended. After the middle ten days, the temperature rises sharply and the hot and humid weather begins. The average monthly temperature is about 27 degrees Celsius, the highest of all months. When it is extremely hot in the afternoon, Nanjing can reach 43 degrees (109 degrees Fahrenheit, seen in 1934), and Shanghai can also reach 42.2 degrees (104 degrees Fahrenheit, seen in 1934). The rainfall in Nanjing (averaging 183 millimeters) reaches its peak, and the rainfall in Shanghai (145 millimeters) is second only to the previous month. There are eleven to thirteen rainy days, and there are many sudden downpours, often accompanied by strong winds and lightning. Southeast winds are frequent, and the visibility is vast. Other characteristics of the climate in this month include the lowest air pressure, the longest sunshine hours, and strong evaporation. This month, cuckoos are rarely seen, lotus flowers bloom, the green mountains are lush, and the scenery of the water and mountains is at its peak.</p>
<p>August: Ginkgo begins to turn yellow, phoenix trees bear fruit</p>
<p>The heat of summer has not yet subsided this month, and the humid heat is still present, but it is not as severe as in the previous month. The average monthly temperature in Beijing and Shanghai is about 27 degrees Celsius, which is similar to the previous month. The absolute maximum is 40 to 41 degrees, which is slightly less than the previous month. The rainfall (122 millimeters) and rainy days (12 days) in Nanjing are less than in the previous month. The rainfall (142 millimeters) and rainy days (a little over 11 days) in Shanghai are almost the same as in the previous month. There are the most cloudy days (14 to 17 days) this month, and there are very few foggy days. The number of heat thunderstorms is even higher than in July. When it arrives, the wind and rain are dark, the thunder and lightning are fast, and the sultry heat is often relieved slightly, which is beneficial to health. The typhoons in the Pacific Ocean have become more frequent since last month, and they are even more frequent this month, and they sometimes land and attack Beijing and Shanghai. Although the strong winds and heavy rains during the passage of a typhoon cause great harm, the cooling effect of retreating the heat cannot be ignored. This month, the south wind is in season, plants are flourishing, the ginkgo begins to turn yellow, and the phoenix trees bear fruit.</p>
<p>September: Osmanthus fragrance, pomegranate red, persimmons and apricots begin to ripen</p>
<p>This month, the seasons enter autumn, the southeast wind gradually disappears, and the north or northeast wind gradually prevails, but the wind is gentle and often intermittent, making it the most peaceful time of the year. In the first and middle ten days, although the heat has subsided and the hot air has retreated slightly, the average temperature of each pentad is still above 22 degrees Celsius. In the last ten days, the golden wind recommends coolness, and the cool feeling invades people. The average temperature of each pentad drops below 22 degrees Celsius. Beijing and Shanghai both enter autumn on the 23rd. The average monthly temperature is 22.8 degrees, which is 4 to 5 degrees lower than the previous month and more than 5 degrees higher than the next month. It is truly the so-called "time when the weather is already cool but not cold". The standard rainfall is 83 millimeters in Nanjing and 128 millimeters in Shanghai. There are ten to twelve rainy days. This month, the sweet osmanthus fragrance wafts, the persimmons and pomegranates ripen red, the ginkgo fruits turn yellow, the phoenix trees drop their seeds, the cold cicadas are rarely seen, and the orioles migrate to the south.</p>
<p>October: Chrysanthemums bloom on the fences, lake crabs are fattening</p>
<p>This month belongs to mid-autumn, the heat has completely dissipated, the golden wind arrives slowly, refreshing and pleasant, making it the best time of the year. The average monthly temperature is about 17 degrees, which is 5.5 degrees lower than the previous month, but 3 to 4 degrees higher than April in early spring. The absolute maximum reaches 32 to 33 degrees, and the minimum is around zero degrees. The average rainfall in Nanjing is 45 millimeters (about half of April), and the average rainfall in Shanghai is 71 millimeters (two-thirds of April). There are eight to nine rainy days, which is as scarce as in November or November and December. Since rainfall is scarce and the temperature is decreasing, combined with low humidity and low cloud cover, abundant sunshine and gentle wind, it is the right time to climb high and look far, and enjoy the scenery. This month, chrysanthemums bloom on the fences, lake crabs are fattening, swallows return to the south, and geese come to the north. Early frost is occasionally seen at the end of the month.</p>
<p>November: Frost descends, maples turn red, phoenix tree leaves fall</p>
<p>This month, sunny days are frequently seen, gentle breezes occasionally arrive, the atmosphere is dry and refreshing, and warm like spring. Like the previous month, it is the best time of the year for climate. However, with the Mongolian high pressure dominating the desert north, its power is very strong, the north wind is gradually becoming fierce, and the scene of the earth is gradually turning bleak. The average monthly temperature in Nanjing is 10.6 degrees, and the average monthly temperature in Shanghai is 11.3 degrees, a sharp drop of more than 6 degrees compared to the previous month, making it the largest change in temperature from month to month. Therefore, diseases of the respiratory system are easily prevalent. The standard average rainfall is 41 millimeters in Nanjing and 52 millimeters in Shanghai. There are eight to nine rainy days. The amount of cloud is about the same as in the previous month, and the number of sunny days (9 to 10 days) is the highest of the whole year. This month, Beijing and Shanghai enter winter on the 27th and 29th respectively. Within the month, frost descends, maples turn red, and phoenix tree leaves fall. Early snow has been seen in Nanjing in the first ten days of the month.</p>
<p>December: Plants wither and turn yellow</p>
<p>This month is governed by the command of early winter, the north wind attacks frequently, the cold is biting, severe frost is seen repeatedly, and auspicious snow falls from time to time. The average monthly temperature is 4.6 degrees in Nanjing and 5.8 degrees in Shanghai. The lowest temperature can reach below minus 10 degrees, and the severity of the cold is only second to January. The standard rainfall is 36 millimeters, the least of all months. The number of days of precipitation is the same as in the previous month, sunny days are eight to eleven days, and cloudy days (about 10 days) are the most, and the amount of sunshine is the least of the year. This month, plants wither and turn yellow, and the scenery is bleak. In the last pentad of the month, the sky is often filled with clouds and the rain and snow are plentiful, which is truly the so-called auspicious snow welcomes the New Year.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Beijing and Shanghai Climate</h3>
<p>Although Beijing and Shanghai are both located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, only 320 kilometers apart, Shanghai (7 meters above sea level) is at the mouth of the Yangtze River into the sea, and is more regulated by the ocean. Nanjing (68 meters above sea level) is slightly further from the sea, and the influence of the ocean is slightly weaker, so the climate of the two places has many small differences within the great similarities.</p>
<p>In terms of temperature: Although the average temperature in both places is about 15 degrees, Nanjing is colder in winter and hotter in summer, which is more than in Shanghai. In spring and summer, the temperature in Nanjing is higher than in Shanghai, and in autumn and winter, it is lower. For example, the average temperature in July is 27.7 degrees in Nanjing and 27.1 degrees in Shanghai; in January, it is 2.2 degrees in Nanjing and 3.2 degrees in Shanghai. Also, using 10 degrees and 22 degrees as the upper and lower limits of spring and autumn temperatures, using the average temperature of each pentad in both places, spring in Nanjing begins on March 17 and ends on May 20, lasting 65 days. Due to the influence of the ocean, spring in Shanghai comes later (March 27) and goes later (June 9), lasting 75 days. Summer in Nanjing is 125 days, 20 days less than in Shanghai. Autumn begins on September 23 in both places. Autumn in Nanjing lasts 65 days, 5 days less than in Shanghai. Winter in Nanjing begins on November 27 and lasts 110 days. Winter in Shanghai begins on November 22 and lasts 125 days. Therefore, summer in Nanjing is particularly long and the temperature is extremely high. The extreme maximum temperature in Nanjing reaches 43 degrees, while in Shanghai it is only 40.2 degrees. The average number of days in Nanjing with a maximum temperature exceeding 35 degrees is 18 days, 4 days more than in Shanghai. The average number of days with an average daily temperature exceeding 30 degrees is 15 days, 12 days more than in Shanghai. Although winter in Nanjing is half a month shorter than in Shanghai, it is colder than in Shanghai. The extreme minimum temperature in Shanghai is minus 12.1 degrees, and in Nanjing it is even lower to minus 13.8 degrees. The average number of days with an average daily temperature below zero is 12 days, 5 days more than in Shanghai. The average number of frost days in Nanjing is about 39 days, and in Shanghai it is 32 days. The number of snowy days in Nanjing is 10 days, and in Shanghai it is 7 days. Whenever it snows in Nanjing, it rains in Shanghai, although this is not always the case, it is a fact that there are more snowy days in Nanjing. For example, in 1925, it snowed for 9 days in Nanjing, but only 2 days in Shanghai. In 1929, there were 20 days of snow in Nanjing, but only 8 days in Shanghai. In terms of spring and autumn temperatures, spring is colder than autumn in places with a shallow degree of continentality. Taking April and October to represent spring and autumn in both places, the temperature in Nanjing is 14.4 degrees versus 17.1 degrees, and in Shanghai it is 13.5 degrees versus 17.4 degrees. Spring in Nanjing is colder than autumn, which is less than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The annual rainfall in Shanghai is more abundant than in Nanjing, as mentioned earlier. Except for April and July, the monthly rainfall in Nanjing is generally slightly less than in Shanghai. July is the month with the most rainfall and rainy days in Nanjing. The most rainfall in Shanghai is in June, as is the number of rainy days. The least rainfall is in December in both places, but the least rainy days are in October in Nanjing and in December in Shanghai. There are more thunderstorms in Nanjing (19 days) than in Shanghai (13 days). There are more foggy days in Nanjing (78 days) than in Shanghai (66 days). The former is mostly in winter, and the latter is frequent in spring and autumn. All of these are the general characteristics.</p>
<h3>The Economic Reality of Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 14th</p>
<p>As the Chinese Lunar New Year approaches, all businesses and shops are conducting a major reckoning. On "New Year's Eve," debt collectors press their claims until dawn. Therefore, the Lunar New Year is the easiest time to see the true state of the social economy. Some call Hangzhou a modern city, but in terms of economic value, it remains fundamentally an agricultural hub, as most of its goods for sale are hard-earned harvests from the rural community. Thus, the Lunar New Year has a particularly intimate connection to it.</p>
<p>Over New Year, Reverence for Gods and Feasting are Paramount</p>
<p>People in agricultural societies highly value the New Year. They believe it essential to show reverence to the gods and engage in hearty feasting. It's said that the gods themselves partake in feasting at this time, so one must not neglect or disrespect them, but instead purchase New Year's goods to honor them. According to old-timers in Hangzhou, in past years, the entrances of shops selling dried goods, incense, and candles were always surrounded by three or four layers of people. This year, however, no matter how the shop owners call out, the fronts of these stores are cold and deserted. There are over 210 such shops in Hangzhou. This time of year, approaching the Lunar New Year, should have been their prime season, but due to sluggish business and the pressure of high-interest loans, as many as 32 have applied to close down. Among those that survive, yellow rice flour, bamboo shoots, and southern vegetables have the best sales. Others like longan, lychee, shark fin, and sea cucumber have plummeted in sales, indicating a decline in purchasing power and a glimpse into the superficial aspects of the social economy.</p>
<p>Tea, Silk, and Oil Industries Face Increasing Risks</p>
<p>Hangzhou is a market for tea and silk. With tea and silk exports facing grim prospects, people in these industries are mostly worried all day long. Many involved in tea and silk are planning to change careers, or are unwilling to reinvest in these industries, instead using their existing capital in other trades.</p>
<p>The edible oil industry is another major business in Hangzhou. However, with the widespread development of state-run oil factories, the business of privately-run oil shops has declined compared to previous years. Those involved in the edible oil business are sensitive to future prospects and are therefore cautiously alert. If they suffer further setbacks, they will face immense risks.</p>
<p>Weak Purchasing Power: Strong Exterior, Hollow Core</p>
<p>Department stores are the key "decorations" of modern Hangzhou. They import all sorts of glass fixtures from Shanghai, as well as Hollywood lipsticks and nail polish, and the latest cigarette cases and match dispensers. In terms of consumption, they have indeed elevated Hangzhou to a modern level. However, Hangzhou is ultimately an agricultural city. The countryside suffers from hunger and cold. Only a very small minority can afford to buy and enjoy these goods. Purchasing power is generally declining, so the department store business is facing a situation of being strong on the outside but hollow on the inside. Only a few, with strong financial resources, who had hoarded large quantities of goods long ago, can barely make a small profit.</p>
<p>Heavy Taxes and High Interest Rates: Depressed Business</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth industry made a substantial profit after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but later yarn prices soared and then plummeted, and sales were sluggish, so it was mostly mediocre. The kerosene business relies on foreign goods to make Chinese money, but it has benefited greatly from the repeated adjustments of foreign exchange rates. Unfortunately, the source is limited and development is not easy. Generally, all industries are in a precarious situation due to heavy taxes and high interest rates. Compared to before the war, the exchange volume of goods is less than one-tenth.</p>
<p>The Money Business is Thriving</p>
<p>The above situation, except for department stores and kerosene, is that the goods are mostly produced by our agricultural society, and then transferred to the urban society for business. Our review shows that they generally fall into a state of economic depression. On the other hand, consumer businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and car businesses have made great profits and are thriving. The Chinese medicine business has also done quite well. However, this kind of vigorous situation actually shows the pathology of society. The development of the hotel industry shows that the housing shortage problem remains unresolved. The development of the restaurant industry shows that the society is increasingly trending towards social interaction and entertainment, rather than focusing on legitimate pursuits. The car industry shows that consumers are extremely increasing their desire for consumption. The Chinese medicine industry shows that Hangzhou is a "sick" society. We may as well take a deeper look at the money business in Hangzhou's financial sector. The money business has made great profits this year. According to a report by the Hangzhou China News Agency, the largest net profit is as high as 50 million yuan. This means that Hangzhou's money business is still in the process of vigorous growth.</p>
<p>Finance is the lifeblood of the social economy. If the blood dries up, the person will wither and die. If the blood is healthy, the person will be healthy. According to the fact that the money business is profitable, Hangzhou's blood is still healthy. This Hangzhou unit may become healthy, or it may improve, or it may be nourished by the thriving business of "Chinese medicine" stores, and eat and drink heavily in a "restaurant," live in a tall "hotel," and go in and out of "cars," luxurious and precious, becoming richer and richer. No, this is just fantasy.</p>
<p>Production Units Face Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>In the above review of the situation, we saw that the sales of local agricultural products are sluggish and declining, while consumer businesses are progressing step by step. A society cannot increase consumption and reduce production, and prosper and grow for a long time. Increased consumption and sharp decline in production will only lead the economy to a state of decline. So where does the money business's profits come from? Is it profiting from investing in production units because the producers are profiting? Is it profiting from doing high-interest loans through so-called "underground banks"? If it is invested in production units, then why is the capital of production units today strained, calling for help but unable to get it, and having to borrow high-interest loans to maintain it?</p>
<p>Today, the tragic situation of the production units is that some of the loans they requested from the government are only enough to repay the interest on high-interest loans, so has the money business lent a lot of money to the production units?</p>
<p>The financial industry is indeed the lifeblood of society! If this blood is frozen in high-interest loans and cannot be metabolized, then it will still wither and die.</p>

<h3>Thinking of the 19th Route Army from the "January 28th" Incident</h3>
<p>In our country's war history, the 19th Route Army, under the overall leadership of Chairman Chiang, became famous in one fell swoop during the "January 28th" Battle, writing a glorious page in the history of combat. The army was initially the Second Brigade of the Guangdong Army, later reorganized into the 10th Division, then into the 61st Division, then into the 11th Route Army, and finally into the 19th Route Army. The army had defeated Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, and other troops. In September of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it defeated He Long's communist troops in Jiangxi Province. In total, it experienced 48 major battles and won 27 victories. The Battle of Shanghai was the 48th major battle experienced by the army. Its morale was high, and its sacrifices were great, which shocked all countries. Later, it was disbanded due to launching a "mutiny." (This newspaper's data room)</p>
<h3>Weekly Forum: Hong Kong Education Encounters Reefs</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>During the war, there were nearly 2,000 overseas Chinese schools in Hong Kong, large and small. Now there are 300. Recently, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Overseas Chinese Education Association requested the Education Department to improve five points due to the unbearable burden of environmental facilities, etc. The department has responded to each one, but none have been resolved. This is because Hong Kong's overseas Chinese schools have encountered reefs. Extreme elements advocate that overseas Chinese schools withdraw from Hong Kong. Negotiations are currently underway! The first and fifth points are both school health issues. The department emphasized: "Hong Kong is now densely populated, which has greatly hindered the health of residents. If the regulations on school medical and health facilities are relaxed, it will inevitably affect the health of students. The regulations of the school are purely for the health of students and teachers, and under the current bad environment, they should be strictly implemented." It also said: "The capacity of the classroom and the distance of the chairs and tables, etc., are all completed by the health inspectors in accordance with the education laws," etc.</p>
<p>We greatly admire the Hong Kong authorities' emphasis on school health and attention to the health of students. School health and school health education are different. School health is an old term. For more than ten years, it has been abandoned in the New World because its scope is too narrow. It is equivalent to prison health, industrial health, military health, social health, oral health, personal health, and national health. And the most important point is that it does not have much educational meaning. Therefore, school health is not used, but school health education is used. It is not enough to only have health in the school. It must contain health with educational significance, so that the value of health is higher. The school is a place of education, and we have no reason to remove education from health!</p>
<p>Moreover, school health education is fundamental. Many important health education activities have limited costs and great benefits, and the school can easily organize them. School health sometimes costs a lot of money, but it is not easy to do due to the environment. What's more, after the war, everything is desolate and everything needs to be done. To repair the suffering of the people, and say: "The world is hungry, why not eat meat porridge!" Therefore, friends who handle health education should weigh the priorities and urgencies, and should focus on the easy and achieve great results!</p>
<p>School health education is a part of health education, implemented in schools. Health education is the sum of various experiences to improve the habits, attitudes, and knowledge of personal, social, and national health. Implementing health education in schools will allow children to receive health education in all their experiences. Based on the experiences that children have in school, no matter what method is used, it has a good influence on children's health habits, attitudes, and knowledge, so its scope should include three aspects. (1) Healthy school life, (2) Health affairs, (3) Health teaching.</p>
<p>The first aspect of a healthy school life is the school environment. In the old-fashioned way, it is environmental health. The second is the teacher's experience, which refers to discipline, fatigue, voice, mental health, learning health, etc. The third is the school organization, such as work and rest time, homework, etc. Health affairs are related to inspection, correction, and vaccination, etc. Health teaching focuses on teaching the principles and facts of healthy living, integrating health knowledge with actual life, and guiding children to grow healthily in schools, families, and society.</p>
<p>In view of this, there are too many things that schools should do to seek the health of students, and there are more things that the government should do. Most of the healthy life and healthy teaching should be effectively handled by the government to urge schools to do so. Most of the health affairs and a small part of the healthy life and healthy teaching should be directly organized by the government, sending nurses, doctors, medicines, training school health education personnel, providing health education materials, and even providing free school meals to poor students like in the UK, should actively take responsibility. Currently, these things have not been done yet, and even if some are done, they have not been done well. Just look at the prevalence of trachoma among children in Hong Kong's public and private schools, and the tuberculin test has not been held yet. It is really unrealistic to only ask private schools to be responsible for a small part of the healthy life that is not easy to improve, and to order strict implementation.</p>
<p>The UK and China are allied countries and of course the bloodstains of fighting side by side have not yet dried, so they should not intentionally embarrass our overseas Chinese education. However, this measure should start with the easy and easy aspects first, and I hope that the Hong Kong government will change to the Education Department in charge of education in accordance with modern trends, and earnestly lead, and first send a group of health education experts to Hong Kong to effectively handle social and school health education. This will not only benefit the students a lot, but also the entire citizens will be grateful.</p>

<h3>Three Major Liberations for Women in Marriage</h3>
<p>— Wang Xin</p>
<p>According to the current situation, there are three things that should be liberated for women in marriage:</p>
<p>(1) Equal Marriage Opportunities. The success of a general marriage is always that the man pursues the woman first, and it is extremely rare for the woman to initiate first. In this way, sometimes a woman loves a man extremely, but is forced by the constraints of etiquette to not dare to speak out frankly, which is what most women feel distressed about. We must thoroughly break the shackles of this etiquette, and men and women can both propose their inner demands.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminate the Concept That a Wife Must Be a Virgin. In the old minds of Chinese people, the first night is a remarkable thing, which is indeed a great insult to women. We must correct this concept. It is not to say that women should not maintain the purity of love, but women may no longer be virgins due to divorce, widowhood, or even violence (such as Miss Shen Chong), but we cannot ruin their future happiness because of their unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>(3) Conscientiously Implement the One-Man, One-Wife System. Although the one-man, one-wife system is clearly stipulated in law, if we look at the situation in society, most husbands, once they have money, the first problem to be solved is to marry a concubine or create a small villa. After having a concubine, it is inevitable to abuse the original wife, which is very unreasonable. Your wife shared your joys and sorrows. Should you forget your wife after you have developed? Analyzing this reason, it is still the current moral decline, neglecting the purity of love, and only seeking the satisfaction of carnal desire. For this reason, we must start from education to make everyone know the sacredness of love and recognize that polygamy is an extremely disreputable thing, then this unreasonable phenomenon can be gradually reduced.</p>
<h3>A Neglected Educational Problem: Are You Willing to Be Beaten and Scolded by Your Child?</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a child raise his little hand to hit his parents or pout his little mouth to scold his parents? I think you must have seen it. I have also seen many. I once saw a five-year-old girl slap her father's face crisply in front of many guests, and I also saw a child who had just learned to speak scold his father "muddlehead" and "lazybones" in his mother's arms!</p>
<p>It seems that the child is too ignorant of the rules, but we cannot blame them, because we know that imitation is the nature of children, especially when they have not obtained sufficient knowledge to clearly distinguish right from wrong. Their minds are innocent, their actions are naive, and it is the parents' responsibility to pay attention to whether the child is developing normally in physiology or psychology.</p>
<p>However, in fact, this important responsibility is often neglected by parents due to love and negligence. They even give the child a smiling approval when it is time to give the child an urgent correction. I don't know that this is creating a dark and bad consequence for the child's future behavior and thinking, and then it will be too late to regret! You must know that in the relaxed and happy daily life of the family, the wife may casually scold her husband, although sometimes this scolding contains the meaning of anger and love, but when the child hears it, he will remember it firmly and learn from his mother's example to scold his father. Maybe he doesn't even understand the meaning of this scolding at all. He just simply sees that his mother says this to his father, and his father still smiles, so why don't I do it too? As for hitting his father, it is even more common. Many mothers also hold their little hands to help them hit their father. Although this is sometimes the joy of the boudoir, the child has no selectivity. When he encounters a banquet, he will also scold you "lazybones"! Slap you in the face, how embarrassed will you be then?</p>
<p>At the same time, you will definitely think that you have been too indulgent with your child. You shouldn't ask him to hit you again after the child hits you once, and you shouldn't hug him and kiss him after being scolded once. All of this is caused by yourself because you fundamentally misunderstood the meaning of being intimate with the child. If you want to express your love, you should create the habit of the child shaking hands or kissing you often, or calling you affectionately instead of scolding you or hitting you!</p>
<p>Dear parents, I hope that your love can be expressed in the most perfect and sacred way, and as an immortal torch in the child's future behavior and thinking, it will always indicate the light.</p>
<h3>Household Matters</h3>
<p>— Yi Xia</p>
<p>Flower Arrangement Method: When the flowers are half open in spring, cut them off with scissors and insert them into a cut radish, and plant them in a flower pot with soil. Water them often and let them see the sun often. When the flowers have bloomed, the roots of the flowers will also grow well. This is the best flower arrangement method for loving flowers.</p>
<p>Mending a Wok: If there is a hole in the wok, just buy a piece of raw pig liver, mash it, and then apply it to the hole. This method is no different from iron repair, saving money and effort.</p>
<p>Removing Rust from a Knife: If a kitchen knife is not wiped dry after cutting vegetables, it will often rust. You can soak the rusted knife in a mandarin orange water tank for one or two days, and then take it out. The rust will be removed by itself, as if it had been polished.</p>
<p>Washing Glass Bottles: We often discard eggshells, but waste also has its uses. Break the eggshells into pieces and use them to wash glass bottles. You don't need to expend the effort of picking and choosing, and you can scrape off dirt and polish them clean and bright.</p>
<p>Getting Rid of Rice Weevils: To avoid rice weevils, you can put charcoal under the rice jar, and they will not breed by themselves.</p>
<p>Washing Hair: Soap must be washed off after washing hair, otherwise there will be a bad smell. Now you can soak it in calcium water to wash it, which is clean and cool. Borax can also be used to wash.</p>
<p>Culinary Affairs</p>
<h3>Homemade "Salad"</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The taste of "salad" in Western cuisine is very good, but it is not easy to make it yourself. The biggest reason is that there is no "salad oil", so it is rarely tasted in the family. Recently, I met a Western chef who told me that "salad oil" can also be made by yourself, but it is more troublesome, and he told me the secret of preparation. Later, I made it according to the method, and it was indeed no different from what I bought. What's more, the things you make yourself are always cleaner and cheaper than what you buy outside? Now I will tell everyone this method:</p>
<p>First buy two large chicken eggs, which must be fresh. Knock them into a bowl, being careful to take out the egg whites for other use, leaving only pure egg yolks. Stir vigorously, then use four taels of cooked oil, adding it drop by drop, stirring quickly with chopsticks to ensure that the egg yolks and oil are evenly mixed, and there must be no oil floating and condensing. Add oil while beating the eggs until the egg yolks in the bowl look very thick. The initial salad oil is complete. The most important thing to pay attention to is to avoid being impatient when adding oil, and the faster you stir, the better. Only after the first added oil is completely mixed can the second one be added again. Otherwise, if the egg and oil separate, this bowl of things will be wasted.</p>
<p>At this time, the oil is dark yellow, sticky and thick, and it is difficult to stir open. You must add some vinegar (you must use pure yellow vinegar, Zhenjiang vinegar cannot be used). Also add it while stirring. At this time, the color of the oil will gradually change from dark to light, and finally become white (slightly yellow), then you can stop adding vinegar and taste it. There must be no sour taste, otherwise too much vinegar has been added, and the salad oil will be completed.</p>
<p>Mix in chopped cooked potatoes, green beans, diced ham, shredded bacon, gizzards, etc., add the right amount of salt, then add the "salad oil" and stir, or pour some tomato sauce on top. If you like spicy food, you may add some pepper powder or even chili oil. In this way, a large bowl of delicious and beautiful food can be served to your family for a big meal. If you take it to entertain guests, you will definitely be praised by everyone.</p>
<p>Usually two egg yolks and four taels of oil are enough to make enough salad oil to mix two large bowls of salad. If there are few people in your family who don't eat much, then half the amount is enough.</p>
<h3>Attitude and Impression</h3>
<p>— Zhi Wu</p>
<p>When you first get a satisfactory partner, don't immediately change your past attitude. Because their approach to you is entirely due to the good first impression you gave them, not because they understand you completely.</p>
<p>Don't desperately dress up, socialize, and be debauched just because you can't find a partner... Being noticed is not necessarily being loved.</p>
<p>If you want your boyfriend to marry you, don't make yourself look old-fashioned and know everything. Say what he wants to tell you first; otherwise, even if you can get married, you will be extremely painful in the future.</p>
<p>When making friends, don't suppress yourself too much to cater to the other person's happiness, unless you can always do this after marriage, otherwise you will regret it. Many marriages break up because both parties say that the other party has "changed", but it is not "changed". It is the true nature that is revealed.</p>
<h3>Glass Utensils</h3>
<p>— Yin Yun</p>
<p>Glass cups and utensils will crack when boiling water is poured into them. If a thin iron utensil is placed under the cup to make it slightly away from the table, it can be avoided. If there are unclean things such as tea stains, wipe it with salt to remove them. When placing new ones, put them in cold water and cook them in a pot over low heat. Wait for the water to boil slightly (it will break when it boils too much, you must know this), add two drops of vinegar, wait for it to cool and take it out, and it can be guaranteed not to crack. (The same applies to glass covers for Western lamps). Wiping and rubbing dressing mirrors, etc., will lose light if you use a chicken feather duster followed by a wet cloth, and the same is true if you hang them in a humid place. If you wipe them with lamp grass heads, kerosene, vinegar, or newspapers, you can avoid the trouble of losing light forever and can be exceptionally bright.</p>
<h3>The New Art of Husband Management</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Love before marriage is like a magnet and a needle, drawn together extremely closely by a natural force. But once married, as the days grow long, it often resembles a deflating ball or a magnet gradually losing its power. Even if on the surface it appears intimate, at least one party always feels somewhat strained. Whether the man is the attracting magnet or the woman the attracted needle, having already come together, they naturally hope to live a close, shared life forever. As a result, the husband thinks about how to control his wife, and the wife thinks about how to control her husband. We must understand this as a necessary, albeit inferior, tactic to maintain their love. However, examining the methods they frequently adopt, they invariably involve strict management and nagging complaints, restricting freedom and severing social connections. Ultimately, this often leads to more unhappiness. Nowadays, everything emphasizes science. According to statistical calculations, men are responsible for initiating the decline, abandonment, and disdain of love after marriage in over 90% of cases. However, women cannot shirk their responsibility; they must bear the blame for not understanding the art of husband management and for making missteps.</p>
<p>The principle of the new art of husband management can be summed up in a very common old saying: "When well-fed and warm, one thinks of sensual desires; when hungry and cold, one resorts to thievery." A beggar never aspires to marry multiple wives and take concubines because his own hunger remains unresolved, preventing him from developing any ambition for external pursuits. To accomplish anything in this world, the prerequisite is time. If your husband has no worries about food and clothing, then what he has in excess is time. Spending long periods with you, he will begin to tire of it. Therefore, in his spare time, he will gradually develop an ambition for external pursuits, providing him with excellent conditions to engage in unfavorable activities. Conversely, a man who spends his days struggling for food and clothing, working diligently for the sake of his family, will not have the time to indulge in fantasies. Therefore, a husband who has attained warmth and satiety must not be granted idle and aimless time. We should use scientific methods, imperceptible to the senses, to subtly deprive him of his leisure. Here are a few simple examples:</p>
<p>(1) Seize time with work: That is, use legitimate work that does not interfere with his original job to consume his excess time. For example, encourage him to practice writing, incite him to develop an interest in photography, or foster a love for painting. Make him unknowingly become absorbed and devoted to these activities, burying himself in research and diligent practice. The result can be that all his spare time is turned into nothing. Or, fortunately, he may open up a new path in these activities, which would be an unexpectedly perfect outcome.</p>
<p>(2) Seize time with entertainment: Perhaps work makes him feel troubled, so entertainment is pleasing. A phonograph, a piano, or even a harmonica can divert him from a lot of spare time. Other options include seasonal travel, hunting, fishing, playing chess, watching plays, etc. However, be sure not to introduce him to entertainment that is detrimental to you.</p>
<p>(3) Seize time with exercise: This method is even better. Most men consider themselves remarkable and, upon hearing about exercise, are often willing to show off their skills, dominating the sports field and looking down on everything. Therefore, it is perfect to have him spend several hours each day at the gym. Moreover, after swimming, playing ball, and other exercises, he can use his remaining time for quiet rest, which is also infinitely beneficial to his body and health. Isn't that a win-win situation?</p>
<p>Science is constantly advancing, and our methods, of course, must never stagnate here. However, it must be noted that if the needle and the magnet have been joined together for too long, although the magnet may lose its attractive force, the attractive force generated on the needle at that time will be enough to keep it permanently attracted to the magnet.</p>

<h3>The Section Chief's Wife</h3>
<p>— Yu Huanren</p>
<p>Ever since the section chief's wife's belly swelled up like a big ball, she often strutted down the street with a smug look on her face. Sometimes she would even stand in front of shops, yawning, and when she encountered another wife, she would chat noisily for a while. Invariably, before she could even get to three and a half sentences, the section chief's wife, afraid that people wouldn't see her "ahead of the game" big belly, would point at it and feign complaint, saying, "Carrying this... thing... is so tiring!"</p>
<p>It is said that the section chief's wife had suffered enough nameless woes because her belly wouldn't grow. The section chief's husband, the section chief, had repeatedly grumbled at her, saying that they had been married for over ten years and she hadn't even farted once, and he insisted on taking a concubine. Every time, the section chief's wife would tighten her face and roll into the section chief's arms in a coquettish manner, not allowing it. Then, she would use her slender jade fingers to point at her husband's nose and say, "Could it be that this is all my fault?" She would laugh with tears in her eyes, but secretly, she couldn't help but resent her belly for being uncompetitive.</p>
<p>Thank God for his blessings! Finally, the section chief's wife's belly gradually grew bigger with the flourishing spring of all things. The section chief's wife changed her former mournful look and became even more fond of greeting other wives on the street with giggles and laughter. The section chief's husband also smiled from ear to ear like a Maitreya Buddha all day long. Now, the couple often woke up laughing in their dreams.</p>
<p>The section chief's husband was in charge of the county's finances. He had plenty of colorful guan jin and golden bars in his pockets, around his waist, and in his shoes. Therefore, even before the little nucleus was born, he had already prepared a small wooden bed, a small bathtub, a small chair and table, and small toys. He had also specially invited a sewing clerk to make small mosquito nets, small pillowcases, small quilts, small coats, and small clothes of various colors. It is said that the child's clothes were made to fit until he was five or six years old! In addition, of course, all the items that the section chief's wife would need before and after childbirth were also prepared properly, such as brown sugar, eggs, ham, and various tonics! ...</p>
<p>When the sun rose and the magpies chirped happily that day, our section chief's wife suffered several life-and-death belly pains. Fortunately, the midwife had been invited to the house half a month earlier, so things didn't get too chaotic. The child was born smoothly. The midwife reported that it was a boy, which delighted the section chief's husband. He immediately ordered the servants who were paid by the county government but "served" in the section chief's house to set off firecrackers and cook noodles and glutinous rice balls. Although in pain, the section chief's wife also revealed a faint smile as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders. At this time, people sending congratulations and gifts were like a constant stream of carriages and horses filling the door.</p>
<p>For this "great joy," the section chief's husband took out several thick stacks of banknotes, each marked with 1000, from the small leather suitcase next to the bed (which really frightened us poor civil servants whose monthly income was not enough to make ends meet). He lavishly held banquets on the "third day" and the "one-month" celebration, and those invited were mostly officials or merchants. While devouring the abundant dishes and wine, they showered the host with flattering words of congratulations, saying that this child had a dignified appearance and would surely be extraordinarily rich and noble when he grew up, all thanks to the accumulated merits of his ancestors. The section chief's wife and the section chief thanked them with beaming faces: "Thank you, thank you everyone..."</p>
<p>However, in the midst of happiness and blessings, the section chief's wife and her husband still felt like a stone was weighing on their hearts, because the child had been sick since birth, and sometimes they couldn't help but break out in cold sweats when they thought about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the diagnosis and treatment of good doctors and good medicine, Bao'er (the child's name) gradually became lively. As a result, the section chief's wife became even fatter than before, and the section chief's husband, of course, had even more guan jin and gold bars in his hands, around his waist, and in his shoes.</p>
<p>Now, the section chief's wife was too impatient to go to that agency to sign in for work, so she quit her job readily, and instead spent all day doting, cherishing, and holding Bao'er like a precious jewel, strolling proudly on the street.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? Look, the section chief's wife is carrying her child dressed in a red wool shirt and pants, walking over from that side with a smile, followed by a nanny.</p>

<h3>Morning in Jiangnan and Other Essays</h3>
<p>— Li Wenxun</p>
<p>Morning in Jiangnan</p>
<p>Mornings in Jiangnan are always clear, even on rainy days. The earliest sound one hears is the rolling of carriage wheels, followed by the trembling of dawn's light on the windowpane. In the orange groves outside the window, the birds begin to chirp, singing the dawn's beautiful melodies. Gradually, one hears the footsteps of women, the rustling of clothes, the sounds of washing, splashing water, and the joyful "quack quack" of flocks of ducks.</p>
<p>I rise and stand by the window, breathing in the fresh, clear scent of autumn. In front of the window is a small, lively river, and beyond that is a narrow, gleaming cobblestone street. I see the women washing by the river, using towels to scrub their already very white teeth, and cupping handfuls of water to rinse their mouths. They turn and glance at their beautiful faces in the water. A group of country girls carrying vegetables hurry past, so healthy and full of vitality, revealing smiles as bright as the morning sun. Children with schoolbags bounce and skip, singing local songs loudly. Newspaper vendors, fried dough stick sellers, and vendors selling various breakfast items shout out their monotonous calls. These sounds arrive at a fixed time, and their melodies never change, becoming not only a temptation for children but also the most accurate clock for this rural town.</p>
<p>The sunlight spreads out, so vast and abundant.</p>
<p>Praise</p>
<p>My hometown used to be very desolate, but it had changed when I returned for the second time. There was a school around my house. This school had just moved from Sichuan, and I heard that the students inside could endure hardship. Every morning, I saw them climbing mountains, breathing fresh air, practicing pronunciation, and diligently reciting English in the sunny countryside. The various timbres and tones were like the birdsong in the forest in the morning. On a square that they had collectively opened up, children happily ran and chanted. Some children hid in the library all day, copying notes. Girls drew water from the ancient well next to them to wash their clothes. They squatted on the ground, revealing healthy legs, and their skillful gestures were so lovely. When they saw strangers, they shyly lowered their heads and pulled down their collars to cover their thighs. Every morning when I walked on the mountain path, I could always see many children leaping like fawns in the mountains. Sometimes they laughed and raised their arms, and sometimes they sat in the sun and sang. What lovely and enviable youth! They repaired the dilapidated houses, turned the barren weeds into a square, filled the suffocating place with young songs, and filled the sorrowful place with youthful laughter, like wild, beautiful flowers blooming all over my ancient, desolate hometown...</p>
<p>Bell Sound</p>
<p>The distant bell is ringing for a long time, and the long-ringing bell makes me drunk.</p>
<p>This is a characteristic of my hometown. Hearing the bell, I hear my dear hometown, just like seeing a pagoda on a wandering road, which gives a city its sense of belonging.</p>
<p>This is the bell of a county middle school, and it contains my childhood, my young lyricism. In this bell, there is truth, love, joy, and sorrow.</p>
<p>This sound is often associated with sunshine and the laughter of a little lover.</p>
<p>Filled with enlightenment, filled with a monotonous note of life, this is a music of childhood that will always echo in my heart.</p>
<p>Now the old gatekeeper has died, and a young one has been replaced. All the fresh, dawn-like children are pouring out of the bell.</p>
<p>What I heard at first was happiness and hope, but now what I hear is aging and melancholy. What I heard at first was departure, but now what I hear is like evening prayer in a church.</p>
<p>The bell is still ringing...</p>
<h3>Traveling in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>I had been preparing to return to my hometown for two months to bury my ancestors, but I was delayed by various matters and could not carry it out. However, Old Ling from my hometown had already come to pick me up. After the war, transportation in the interior was very problematic, so I decided to take the route through Hangzhou and take a civilian boat up the river.</p>
<p>"Above, there is heaven; below, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." I had not been to the paradise on earth for a full ten years. I bought a second-class ticket in advance and went to the North Station with my nephew Wen Zhong and Old Ling. I boarded the train one and a half hours before departure, thinking that there would be plenty of time. However, the passengers were extremely crowded, and we could not find a foothold in the second-class carriage. We squeezed and squeezed again, but we were still sardines in the third-class carriage. It was truly a gathering of talented people, young and old, gathered together to celebrate this thirty-fifth New Year's Eve. "Travel" and "journey," these two pleasant terms, have probably become historical relics. The result that war has brought to the people is broken tiles and crumbling walls, with corpses lying on top of each other. The beautiful Jiangnan, which was once a vast expanse of plains, is covered with a desolate and gloomy mask.</p>
<p>We boarded the wooden boat, and after everything was arranged, we felt inspired to go and admire the West Lake scenery that we had been separated from for ten years, to revisit these two ancient poems: "If you want to compare West Lake to Xizi, it is always suitable whether lightly or heavily made up." Perhaps it was because of this late winter month that the trees were bare and the lake was empty, leaving only a few light boats floating on the vast expanse of water. I always felt that Xizi was gradually aging, or perhaps my personal state of mind had changed. As the seasons changed, the expression of natural scenery also changed its color. However, the return of spring after winter is a continuous cycle, while the years of life are like "the passing of time, never stopping day and night," never to return. The mountains and lakes are still the same, but the people are completely different. The lessons of history are extremely cruel, and we had infinite feelings when we visited the Yue Wang Temple (Yue Fei's Tomb).</p>
<p>Taking the value of sightseeing itself, if one is not limited by time, it is extremely poetic to take a wooden boat and row on the beautiful Fuchun River. However, the countryside after the war is like a thin and weak patient, mentally depressed and skeletal. This beautiful name "Fuchun River" has unfortunately become a "Poor River." The high mountains on both sides rise and fall, which is known as the Little Three Gorges. The most famous scenic spot is Yan Ziling's Fishing Terrace, which stands majestically with a myriad of scenes. This is a manifestation of the characteristic of the Eastern nation's indifference to utilitarianism and a historical fact of glorious history.</p>
<p>"Learning is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat." The wooden boat we were sitting on was towed by a small fire truck, and it was quite fast to sail upstream. After arriving in Tonglu, because the water was shallow and there were many shoals, and the river was narrow, we resumed using the old method that had not changed for thousands of years, concentrating the strength of nine people to pull the boat, moving forward step by step with great effort while "moaning" and "groaning." This life on the water is quite interesting. When the wind is favorable, the white sails are hoisted, and the boat sails very fast, making one's heart feel refreshed. However, the kitchen at the stern emits smoke into the cabin, irritating the eyes and causing tears to flow incessantly, making one feel as sad as if one's parents had died. By the evening, the boatmen and passengers were crammed into the cabin.</p>
<p>The wooden boat I was on, counting men, women, old, and young, had more than thirty people, just like sardines packed in a can. The laboring and sacred boatmen were really out of touch with changing clothes and bathing. Group sleeping and breathing foul air made people very uncomfortable. I never expected that after we returned home, our close-fitting underwear had become a colony of white lice. "It's good at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to go out at any time" is truly a realistic saying.</p>
<p>In the evening, our boat docked at Jiande (formerly Yanzhou Prefecture). Two soldiers and two policemen came, holding guns and claiming that they had a secret order from their superiors to have us change to another wooden boat and clear all people and goods. The passengers were stunned and didn't know what to do. I said that I wanted to see their superior to find out the cause and then make a decision. He looked at me wearing a blue cloth gown, looking very countrified, and flatly refused, with arrogance. Finally, I showed him my ID card, explaining that now the constitution had been promulgated and we had entered the constitutional era, and people could move freely. Fortunately, it was not like playing the lute to a cow. After the police chief mediated, we escaped the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>When the boat arrived in Chun'an, we changed to a public bus. Various facilities in the interior were abnormal, and all travelers were headache. Although the price of provincial highway buses was low, there were few buses and many people. They ran on even and odd days. The pricing of commercial buses had no standards. The price was reduced when there were few passengers, and the price was increased when there were many passengers. The section of road from Chuntun to Shexian was only 90 kilometers. The highway bus fare increased from 7,000 yuan to 9,000 yuan, and the commercial bus fare ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. The difficulty of traveling can be seen. Along the way, in various stations and villages, there were few people, and the common people had disheveled hair and dirty faces. The countryside had nothing to destroy.</p>
<p>Our family has lived in Shexian County in Huizhou for generations. It is a desolate ancient county. The residents are hardworking, frugal, and simple in their lives. Most of them do business or study abroad. Two special figures in academic circles came from this place: one is the contemporary philosopher Hu Shih from Jixi, and the other is the recently deceased educator Tao Xingzhi from Shexian. The places where they studied and played in their childhood still exist. After the long eight-year war of resistance against Japan, the enemy's bombing changed many faces. When I stepped into my home, I couldn't help but shiver. The back house had become ruins, and the front hall had no walls. The high-rise hall had become a ruined temple. It was a pity that there were no Qingqing and Hongyu, otherwise I could have converted to Buddhism and become a monk.</p>
<p>The best scenery in the area is the Taiping Bridge (also known as Hexi Bridge) in the west gate. It is made entirely of green stone and was built in the Ming Dynasty. It is half a mile long and is a sixteen-hole bridge that spans the Lianjiang River. Chinese and foreign people who visit Huangshan will definitely linger and look around here. At the end of the road is the Xiqian Scenic Area. The tall trees are shaded, and the ancient pagoda stands tall. Looking from a distance, the Ziyang, Piyun, and Cuiwei peaks surround each other and overlook the Lianjiang River, which twists and turns like a ribbon. Below is the Sanyue Beach, with the sound of Yong always rushing. The local poet Xu Qingyan said:</p>
<p>The road hanging over the stream bank has several layers, the mountain wind blows and brushes the green mist;</p>
<p>I often think of the autumn sentences in the three volts, wash the inkstone and move the boat to the stone spring.</p>
<p>Proceeding dozens of steps, the environment is secluded. Climbing the steps, there is the tomb path of the ancient monk Mei Hua, with dozens of plum trees planted on both sides; after a week, one will see its cold and lonely posture in the ice and jade bones, embellishing the famous mountain. Further up is the tomb of Jiantang Shangren; the monk Jiantang is a New Anhui painter of his generation, who writes Huangshan with fine brushstrokes, uniquely marking his style and surpassing his time. It is a pity that there are very few works handed down to the world, which cannot be found in the local people. In June of the twenty-ninth year, Jitung Jushi, Mr. Wang Caibai, died of illness in his hometown at the age of fifty-four. Those who heard about it regretted it. The local people held a public burial here. Caibai's paintings are exquisite, and his poetry is pure and unique. He has written a collection of Wolong Travels in the Yellow Sea, which is popular in the world; domestic painters admire his art. In the past, we lived together in Nanjing and often visited each other. At that time, Wang taught in the Art Department of Zhongda University, and his students were extremely prosperous. Now that people and heavens are eternally separated, I feel lost and wandering by the base, I can't help but touch the scene and hurt. Below, there is a pavilion built to record his life deeds, and the painting "Wind Willow Mingshan" is engraved on the stone, with a seven-character poem attached, the calligraphy is strong and lovely, the poem says:</p>
<p>The water is beautiful and the sand is clear, this is unique, Wuliao City sails on the blue glass;</p>
<p>Containing Feng and spitting Lian, Xiqian Yue, blowing the flute to Qinglian a poem.</p>
<p>I lived in my hometown for a total of six days. Most of my neighbors and relatives have passed away. I have been studying in Shanghai since I was a child, and it has been thirty years in a hurry. During this period, after two world wars, recalling the past, I really have a sense of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>"How long can you be young, the temples are already pale, half of the old friends are ghosts, screaming in the heart, how can you know that after twenty years, you will be in the gentleman's hall again. …"</p>
<p>Du Gongbu's poem to Wei Ba Chushi is nothing but a picture of today.</p>
<h3>Staying Up on New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>The cold wind and twilight often remind me of the scene of staying up with my father on Lunar New Year's Eve in my old home in my hometown. My father's mottled hair, his old and thin face; he was wearing a swollen robe and meditating by the candle holder. He never liked to say any farewell words to me, and I quietly watched him. The sequence of the year ends once a year, but the burden that this humble family places on my father's shoulders only gets heavier year after year!</p>
<p>The years give him only worries and sighs. I know that he does not want to pour the bitter juice of life that he has learned in his old age on the young, naive and simple heart of his child. It's only that the years are ruthless, and now I have realized the flavor of my father's past; carrying the sorrows of life, walking on the path of worries...</p>
<p>This year, the lintel of the old house has fallen off, the wind and rain are obscure, and my father has long left the world. The shrine in the hall no longer has the red paper that he personally wrote and changed every year, or perhaps even those faded paper marks left over from previous years have been incomplete. The red paper strips that were pasted in the past, such as "Full of Auspiciousness" and "Five Generations of Prosperity," may have caused some heartfelt joy in my father's life. However, no one remembers these things now. I am drifting thousands of miles away from my hometown, and now, when my mother is lonely on New Year's Eve, I wonder what she feels?</p>
<p>Staying up on New Year's Eve, waiting for dawn, the rooster crows and dances. Staying up on New Year's Eve can encourage the activity of life and the development of will, just like this old Western saying: "Old age praises life, dusk praises white books."</p>
<p>But when will we be able to obtain this joyful excitement of life?</p>
<h3>Poetry Talk</h3>
<p>— Wu Tunwu</p>
<p>The boundaries between beauty, goodness, and poetry are difficult to define because they are originally the same kind of tool, a powerful tool to promote human development and move towards the door of happiness.</p>
<p>If some people think that the fresh blood on the arrows of the greedy is beautiful, the useful incense of the paunchy is good, and the dissolute and lazy tails of the past are actually poetry; we will not hesitate to give them the greatest contempt and disgust.</p>
<h3>Sending Off My Younger Brother Wu Zhaosu to Study in America</h3>
<p>— Li Tuozhi</p>
<p>The flowing light of Xiepu proves my pure heart, the clear shadow of Bashan is found in my dreams. From now on, the bright moon will shine on the ends of the earth, and I will miss you even more when I look at you across the sea.</p>
<p>The reeds and wind by Xuanwu Lake, the colors of the Six Dynasties are in the faint smoke. Your travels have passed by the Rouge Well, and a touch of warmth is different.</p>
<p>Sending off a good friend further west, the wild rooster crows on Kunlun Mountain. Love the world without the same kind, and teach your embrace to be equal to all things.</p>
<p>The hurried Jinghu train comes and goes, passing by the wine shop several times. Remember the patriotism of the motherland: the warmth of spring in Jiangnan is full of orioles and flowers!</p>
<p>The voices of people around the city building are surrounded by lights, do not pity the parting and get drunk. All the friends on the seat are handsome and young, whose charm is the most flying?</p>
<h3>Water: Random Memories from a Window – Part Two</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>When one thinks of water in China, one must count the regions south of the Yangtze River, especially the area around Lake Tai. The water of Lake Tai, one of the five great lakes, is especially clear. That is my hometown, to which I long to return, with its free and unrestrained scenery, rich in gentle sentiments. Paddy fields and rivers are all over the countryside, which is known as the "Land of Fish and Rice." The rivers there are very wide, with water so clear you can see the bottom. Algae and swimming fish move like they are in a large glass box. Countless boats float on the water. The most interesting are not the steamboats, but the folk boats, especially the fishing boats. The women who work on these boats have a special charm. They expose their arms and legs to adapt to their lives and out of natural necessity, not for fashion. Their skin is reddish-black and healthy, and especially their dark cheeks, their beautiful eyes flowing with waves, are captivatingly charming. They can row, punt, cast nets, cook, wash clothes, and sing. Their songs are beautiful, clear, gentle, and not lewd, but rather elegant music. Most interestingly, in the morning, they sit on the boat, comb their hair facing the water, look at their reflection in the water, using the water as a mirror. One can imagine how clear and beautiful the water there is.</p>
<p>Along the city's waterfront, there are rows of fishing shops, lumber shops, rice shops, and bamboo shops. Large shop signs are written on the walls. This is because boats are the means of transportation for goods and people's travel in that area. Thousands of boats row in from the surrounding countryside, loaded with people's food and supplies, seeking large shops to sell to on the river. These large characters on the walls indicate the strong capital and commercial credit inside. When people see these big characters and so many boats, they can imagine the prosperity of the place. The reflections of houses and boats hang in the water, and countless bamboo and wooden rafts float on the water's surface. People form markets on the water. You can see them on boats, bamboo rafts, and wooden rafts, socializing, singing, arguing, drinking, and moving things. In the summer, some people jump into the water like frogs and start swimming.</p>
<p>Who says that the waters of Venice are so beautiful? Many European Romance writers have described it as the backdrop for stories. This water town area in Jiangnan, China, is also bright and beautiful scenery worth praising. Many "ballads" and scripts from the Ming and Qing dynasties wrote many stories of talented scholars and beautiful women here. Now, there are many storytellers in this area. They use a three-stringed lute and a fan to attract many people.</p>
<p>The people here rely on water for a living. Without water in the rivers and ponds, there would be no fish. Without water in the paddy fields, there would be no rice. And the water here is so clear, so the women here look especially like water hyacinths.</p>
<h3>Maternal Love</h3>
<p>— L. Cischia</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Superman</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>The comic that has fascinated children all over America</p>
<p>"Young readers are positively influenced: they know that justice will prevail and goodness will ultimately overcome evil!"</p>
<p>Along with all kinds of American goods, comic books starring "Superman," who punched down the "Empire State Building" with one punch, have also crossed the ocean and entered China.</p>
<p>"Superman" is the creation of two short, Cleveland, Ohio youths who experienced childhood frustration. Their names are Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. When they were studying at the city school, they were often beaten by mischievous children nearby. Both were sons of poor parents and liked to read cheap Chinese "Water Margin"-type novels, yearning for the invincible heroes in the books.</p>
<p>Jerry was somewhat capable of using a pen, and when he discovered Joe's talent for drawing, he dreamed of a "super hero." "Its" deeds could be depicted in comics. "I got this idea in bed one night," Jerry recalled. A combination of "Samson (a strongman in the Old Testament), Hercules (a strongman in Greek mythology), and Atlas (a giant in Greek mythology who bears the weight of the sky), plus the virtue of Sir Galahad, his mission in life is to clear the world of thugs.</p>
<p>Where does Superman come from?</p>
<p>The two young men collaborated for six years, producing miles of "Superman" adventure history comics, but they were all rejected by the editor and thrown into the wastebasket. Then, one day in 1938, publisher Harry Donenfeld first bought the first "Superman" story for $130 and published it in "Action Comics" magazine, which became an instant hit. Since then, "Superman" has earned millions of dollars. The two 30-year-old authors—although they had originally sold all the rights—also continued to share in the profits.</p>
<p>Today, "Superman" is a huge business. About three million readers regularly buy "Action Comics," "Superman," and "World's Finest Comics" magazines. "Superman's" "headquarters" are these three magazines, and more than 200 related newspapers reprint them. Their total sales are about 20 million copies. There are dozens of products with "Superman" as a trademark. In addition, there is a "Superman" radio program, broadcast by coastal radio stations.</p>
<p>Of course, "Superman's" biggest impact is on children. Parents also know its importance and often ask "Superman" to order young people to write a line to stop biting their fingernails. More enthusiastic young readers write letters, and "Superman"—through a group of secretaries in "its" publisher's New York office—advises young people to sleep ten hours a day, eat more vegetables, and assert that all thugs have "yellow streaks."</p>
<p>For years, Siegel and Shuster have been writing and drawing "Superman" together. Because "Superman's" influence on children is so great, they must take on the task of instilling faith, a responsibility similar to that of parents and teachers, guiding the publishers of this comic. Therefore, they hire professional men and women in the fields of child psychology, education, and welfare to actively assist.</p>
<p>This editorial advisory group includes Dr. Johnson, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Chetek of the Department of Educational Psychology at Columbia University, and Lieutenant Colonel Milliken, a publishing inspector for the Department of the Army. These experts pay attention to correct English, psychologically sound behavior, and morality. Every "Superman" story has been proofread by them.</p>
<p>Recently, Dr. Chetek analyzed an average "Superman magazine." His conclusion was: "This magazine contains more than 10,000 words of reading material. It is a source of education, leading children to a vast vocabulary, including many useful words that children in grades four through eight need deeper instruction to learn."</p>
<p>Does "Superman" have a good influence on children? Professor Bender, a psychological researcher at Brivive, and Miss Frank of the Children's Learning Association, both believe that "Superman" has a clear and positive influence.</p>
<p>"Children can enjoy the thrill of danger, just like adults reading horror novels," Miss Frank said. "They know that justice will prevail and goodness will ultimately overcome evil." Superman does not harm the good.</p>
<p>To prove this, she gave an example: a little boy warned his female playmate, "Be careful! I am Superman, I will hurt you."</p>
<p>"You can't scare me," his opponent said, "Superman" never hurts good people."</p>
<p>"Superman" has made "its" authors and publishers rich, but they have also fulfilled their educational responsibilities.</p>
<p>Can't the authors of our country's "Little Books" also imitate and improve their style? Can't child educators also use tools similar to "Superman"?</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the "Worldly Elder"</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>The ways of the world and human relationships are all different.</p>
<p>(Note: The "Worldly Elder" has published several pieces in this journal, full of witty remarks. Now, two or three anecdotes about the elder have been discovered, which are still recorded for readers.)</p>
<p>The elder accompanied an important person to visit a certain place. News reporters suddenly gathered and asked about the current situation, which made the important person very embarrassed. The elder then spoke on his behalf, saying: "Chief X came here purely for a private visit and has no official business. After this visit, he feels that China's future is extremely optimistic." The reporter laughed, and the elder also laughed, and this predicament was resolved.</p>
<p>A certain chief wanted to celebrate his mother's birthday, but was afraid of public criticism. The elder wrote a birthday message for him, saying: "At the beginning of the founding of the country, the war has not ended, the people are hungry, and there are starving corpses in the wild. I respectfully follow my mother's order and donate all the funds for the birthday celebration to charity to benefit the disaster victims."</p>
<p>An elder had a friend who was engaged in official duties and was quite loyal in his advice, but he was not promoted for many years. His colleagues were active and ran around, neglecting their duties, and even rose above him. The friend went to his residence to complain about the injustice. The elder then made a riddle to illustrate it, saying: "In the past, Dharma asked Guanyin Bodhisattva, 'I have been meditating facing the wall for nine years, without a single desire, but I cannot ascend. Lü Dongbin got drunk three times at Yueyang Tower, violating the alcohol taboo, privately escorted He Xiangu, violating the lust taboo, drew his sword and slashed the Yellow Dragon, violating the anger taboo, and turned stone into gold, violating the wealth taboo, but he is listed among the Eight Immortals. Why is this?' The Bodhisattva smiled and said: 'Dongbin travels to the Canghai in the morning and Kunlun in the evening, walking many roads in a day. You have been meditating facing the wall all day, lazy and immobile, how can you ascend?'" The friend suddenly understood and has since been running around every day.</p>
<p>A certain person was henpecked. Friends would ridicule him whenever they gathered. The person blushed and was ashamed to answer. The elder relieved him by saying: "It's nothing for him to be afraid of his wife. If you were afraid of your wife, that would be strange." Those who heard it laughed, and the person was relieved.</p>
<p>The elder went to a barber shop for a haircut. After finishing, he took out a thousand yuan as payment. The barber thought it was too little, so he smiled and said: "The young master gives two thousand yuan, the old master should give more." The elder angrily said: "He can ask me for money, I have no place to ask for money." The barber heard this and waved him away.</p>
<p>The elder carried a suitcase and bedding to a certain county. He encountered a thief on the way. He first gave him the suitcase, and the thief accepted it, but then demanded the bedding. He gave it to him again. The thief, thinking he was stupid, forced him to take off his coat. The elder smiled and said to him: "A gentleman does not contend for anything, why are you so greedy!" The thief angrily pounced on him and stripped off all his clothes. The elder then became very angry and said: "How difficult it is to find a gentleman!"</p>
<h3>Taking Advantage of a Fire to Loot and Fishing in Troubled Waters</h3>
<p>— Shao Zhenhe</p>
<p>When reading the Nanhua Sutra, there are these two sentences: "Entering the water without getting wet, entering the fire without getting hot." At that time, I thought, if there really are such characters in the world, wouldn't they become "either immortals or demons"? In fact, this is stupid thinking, so stupid that I can laugh at myself, laugh at myself for having such naive ideas!</p>
<p>To put it "kindly," the fire brigade and the lifeboat can represent the idea that anyone who does "firefighting" or "rescue" work needs to be able to "enter the fire without getting hot, enter the water without getting wet." If these two types of people "are afraid of fire and avoid heat" or "are afraid of water and avoid moisture," what else can they do? It's simply absurd. All of the above is well known, and there is no need to give examples.</p>
<p>Firefighting. Literally, it seems that as long as the fire is extinguished, the task is completed. In fact, all the people in the fire who are affected by the fire, whether dead or injured, or only have one breath left, even knowing that they are pulled out from the rubble pile will not help, but according to "humanity" and "conscience," they are all included in the rescue list. Firefighting is like this, and rescuing from drowning should be the same. This is also well known, and there is no need to give examples.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other characters who "enter the fire without getting burned, enter the water without getting wet." As long as two more are mentioned, it can be "applied by analogy." One is "taking advantage of a fire to loot," and the other is "fishing in troubled waters."</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a fire to loot requires not being afraid of fire and not avoiding heat; fishing in troubled waters requires not being afraid of water and not avoiding moisture. The basic spirit is the same as firefighting and rescuing from drowning, the only difference lies in some purposes.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a fire to loot does not require rescuing people, nor does it require rescuing the fire. The fire is an opportunity for you to "take advantage of." With this opportunity, you should adapt to the situation and not be rigid. To give an example, in the "flying disasters" that have occurred one after another and the recent "fire disaster" in Shanghai, they can be found. It is said that in Vietnam, many victims were not yet dead, still moaning! However, the people who came to "rescue" were concerned with touching gold rings and wallets. Of course, anything you want can be "rescued!"</p>
<p>As for the recent "fire disaster" in Shanghai, they actually talked about "jin tou" (catty price) with gold bars as a condition. It is said that there were really gold bars in this fire, so what was rescued was "gold," so they had to turn their minds to the head of the gold. "Taking gold from the fire" is originally a difficult task!</p>
<h3>Natural Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Weiss</p>
<p>Soap</p>
<p>In murmurs, removing the filth of others.</p>
<p>Button</p>
<p>Strictly disciplining oneself, while also managing others.</p>
<p>Flower and Vase</p>
<p>The vase said to the flower: You exist for me. The owner is praising me.</p>
<p>The flower said to the vase: No, no, you exist for me. Don't you hear the owner praising me?</p>
<p>Ox and Needle</p>
<p>A string connects the ox and the needle in the same way.</p>
<p>The ox follows it;</p>
<p>But the needle drags it.</p>
<h3>Spring Couplets</h3>
<p>— Little Bear</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, I saw two couplets that were quite interesting, so I will record them as follows:</p>
<p>"The people suffer greatly, and there are few good tidings of peace talks."</p>
<p>(This is the Spring Couplet in front of the Wanhe Department Store on Jiangxi North Road. The sentiment and text are both very profound.)</p>
<p>"Benefit the country and the people, promote the cause and build a foundation." (This is the Spring Couplet in front of the Fuchang Brick and Tile Shop on Haining Road. The content is quite relevant.)</p>
<h3>Praise for Oneself</h3>
<p>— Liangzai</p>
<p>—Someone Behind the Mirror—</p>
<p>The American "Libbey-Owens-Ford" Glass Company has recently manufactured a mirror by coating a very thin sheet of chromium alloy on a glass plate. People standing in front of the mirror can clearly see themselves due to the reflection of the chromium alloy; but this chromium alloy also allows some light to pass through, allowing people standing behind the mirror to see the person looking in the mirror.</p>
<p>Life Magazine displayed such a mirror in the rest area of ​​a theater in Times Square. They installed a small dark room like a sentry box behind the mirror and sent photographer Yale Joel to hide in this dark room, waiting for an opportunity to act. Because the small room was dark, Yale Joel could leisurely examine the people standing in front of the mirror, while those who were being tricked saw nothing but their own reflection.</p>
<p>Of course, like other public mirrors, the alloy mirror that Yale was hiding in was quickly taken care of by people. Some applied lipstick in front of the mirror; some straightened their hats; some straightened their ties; some arranged their skirts; some examined themselves in the mirror for a long time and smiled before leaving; some winked and preened themselves. Mr. Yale Joel, the "man in the mirror," was too busy to keep up, his hands and feet in a mess. Seventeen of his works were published in Life Magazine, including:</p>
<p>Seven women: One about twenty years old was straightening her twisted skirt, her boyfriend (?) watching her and smiling. A fat lady, looking about forty years old, smiled and pulled the back of her hat. Two middle-aged women seemed to be very concerned about their eyes, one lightly stroking her eyebrows with her fingers, and the other carefully examining her eyelids, as if to determine whether they were single or double. The two who were applying lipstick and moistening their lips with their tongues looked very relaxed. The last one lifted her skirt and carefully straightened her stockings.</p>
<p>Ten men: One was winking and examining his teeth. One was pulling on his stiff collar, looking like he was suffering from it. The man with the brightly colored tie was forcefully pulling up his already not-too-low pants. Two gentlemen with thick eyebrows and big eyes were diligently worrying. One was twirling his chin, worried that his beard was too long; one was pressing his nose, afraid that scrofula would grow. The one whose face resembled Bing Crosby was holding a paper bag in one hand and straightening his hat with the other, a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth. The two who were blowing their noses and wiping their glasses, I really don't understand why they had to stand in front of the mirror. One who was bending over to tie his shoelaces was also included in the shot. The most ridiculous was this gentleman who squeezed one eye shut, opened the other wide, and held onto his coat with both hands. He walked to the mirror just to praise himself. Yale Joel called him "Slif-A mirer".</p>
