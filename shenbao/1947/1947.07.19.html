<h3>主席主持國務會議　動員綱要修正通過　共黨國代府委名額取消</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕國府委員會十八日晨舉行第七次國務會議，蔣主席親自主持，到會委員　孫科，張羣，居正，于右任，張　，鄒魯，翁文灝，王寵惠，邵力子，王世杰，蔣夢麟，鈕永建，吳忠信，曾琦，余家菊，胡海門，戢翼翹，莫德惠，王雲五，徐傳霖等廿人。立法院　院長吳鐵城，司法院副院長李文範，財政部長俞鴻鈞，國防部長白崇社，文官長吳鼎昌，參軍長薛岳，主計長徐堪均列席。報告事項：（一）取消共產黨國大代表，國府委員名額及共產黨現任參政員予以除名，並令後辦理選舉不再為共產黨保留名額案，經行政院會議通過報府，請予施行，已由府分行遵辦（二）中葡關於取消葡萄牙在華領事裁判權及處理其他事項之換文案。（三）國民參政會駐會委員會第二次會議各項建議，經令行政院分別處理案。（四）宣誓條例修正案。次由委員兼外長王世杰及國防部長白崇社分別報告最近外交及軍事情形。旋即討論提案，（一）動員戡亂完成懲政實施綱要案，決議修正通過。（二）本年繼續徵借實物，以充軍食案，決議通過。（請參閱第二版）（三）行政院政務委員兼糧食部部長谷正倫辭職照准，任命愈飛繼任案，決議通過。（四）任命邢森洲為監察院監察委員案，決議通過。（五）各機關財政預算案多起均通過。至十二時半散會。</p>
<p>張羣出席會議闡述動員意義</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕動員戡亂完成憲政實施綱要案，十八日提國務會議討論，首由行政院長張羣對原案予以說明，略稱；政院自奉頒厲行全國總動員以貫澈和平建國方針訓令，經即遵令通飭所屬，闡述動負意義，督導切實遵行，並由院會一再研討，擬具實施綱要十八條，主要精神即一面加強動員人力，物力，以期迅速戡平共匪叛亂，掃除民主障礙，一面仍盡力刷新地方政治，改善人民生活，對於人民之基本利切實保護，務使全國軍民及各級官吏乃至並世諸友邦均曉然於我致府之動員戡亂不僅屬於消極性的，加強剿匪軍事，而實為積極性加緊國工作，戡亂以謀統一，剿匪並不影響憲政實施，庶能力量集中，迅平共匪，和平建國，早日達成。張羣報告畢，當有委員多人發表意見，提出修正，其中尤對第十七條「除本綱要已有規定者外，爲達成戡亂之目的，政院得依國家總動員法之規定，隨時發布必要之命令」一點有所異議，因此項實施綱要，僅屬於某數部份，而非全部，故在此綱要用定者外之事甚多，自無法隨時發布命令。另說亦認爲此項綱要部份係根據總動員法而來，此款內不必對總動員法重覆敍述，討論甚多，當經蔣主席起立稱：此條可加以解釋，即政院院長在必要如有命令之發布，必須經國務會議之通過或提出報吿以爲認可，如不承認時，當仍不能實行，旋經全體委員一致同意後通過。</p>
<p>王世杰白崇社報告外交軍事</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕王世杰·白崇社十八日在國務會議中分別就外交，軍事提出報告，外交部份有對日和約及魏德邁特使來華兩點，對日和約之成立，初步草約之擬定及和會舉行地點與時間，王氏稱：美主張對日和約參加為十一國，吾人自當贊同，且決定參加，會中之否決權問題，頃已決定採取服從多數辦法。王氏並對魏特使來華使命有所說明。軍事報告皆表示東北共軍因受國際援助，兵力較強，惟目前已為政府軍截斷其主力，同時，若干地區因受大水影響，路綫被截斷者甚多，故目前戰局雙方均少進展。其次，魯中共軍有向津浦綫及像西會師情勢，我正嚴密防範中。報吿後，府委多人會有提出詢問者，由王。白兩氏分別作答。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日〔〕取消共黨國大代表，國府委員保留名額及共黨現任參政員除名案，十八日在國務會議中提出報告，全體委員一致認爲並無異議。按此舉實爲總動員法公布後政府表明態度，加強戡平共軍之表示，按照國府組織法第十條規定：「國府設委員以四十人爲限，由國府主席就中國國民黨內外人士選任之」，其中並未規定共黨委員人數，亦無爲共黨保留名額之明文，現實有委員廿九人，係在四十人限內，自屬合法。同時，多數認爲此項數額不必補足，因廿九名已足法定數額，亦有認爲今後如辦理選舉，不必再爲共黨保留名額。</p>

<h3>寗省兵力雄厚　共軍野心不逞</h3>
<p>馬鴻達對本報記者談</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕寗夏省主席馬鴻達，十八日晨接見本報記者。馬氏談稱：此次乃奉當局電召來京述職，因蔣生席對陝北共軍竄擾密邊事特表關切，十七日謁見主席時，曾就當地情况詳予報吿，現尙聽候指示中。旋記者即詢以寗省地方軍力如何？馬氏稱，寗省地方民衆訓練頗有根基，足以禦敵，然勝利後共軍肆意擾亂，實爲心腹之患。此次匪軍彭德懷部全力擾至寗邊，有進侵寗省企圖，然終以我地方武力訓練有素，團結力量雄厚，故可斷言，如共軍欲實現其野心進入寗夏，即以極大力量，亦不可得，因此次戰果我已解決共方兵力三團半，其所稱雄之鐵八團，亦全團覆沒。其次，馬氏曾談及經濟，敎育諸點。關於敎育，小學尙多，中學全省僅師範三所，將來當設法增多。經濟方面，屬於工業者，設有手工，輕工業之工廠數所。一般說來，可自給自足。馬氏曾於民國廿五年來京，此來爲十一年後之首次，對首都建設極爲稱讚。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕陳誠總長十八日晨在接見記者席上表示：東北人士愛國殷切，有靑年，有民衆，是實行三民主義之最好區域。本人在東北一週，覺各單位須多做自我檢討，現多對己原諒有加，對人指責深刻，形成怨天尤人現象。剿匪是國家要强的事，現已正式下動員令，也可謂討伐令，如真正剿匪，預計三個月可成功，但因國際性牽掣，或有拖延，此怪自己不爭氣，不努力。關內外無輕重之分，有先後之別，關內正致力摧毀共軍，魯軍事重心及陝，晋政治重心已轉有利態勢，東北征兵很快會補充起來，大家對共軍六次再來有戒心，是好現象。人人不願亡國做亡國奴，更不希望第三次大戰，也不願把蘇聯當敵人。又謂：本人原擬留東北二週，現奉命急返，十八日下午三時飛平即返京。</p>

<p>動員戡亂完成憲政實施綱要，全文凡十八條，昨日上午已經行政院送由國務會議通過，公布施行。其中與經濟上有關者，爲第四·五·六·十·十一·十二等條，以性質分別之：（一）爲徵購徵用的規定，（二）為囤積居奇的製裁，（三）為生產及社會秩序的維持，（四）為日用品·金融·貿易及工資的管制，（五）爲生產，運輸等事業的輔助和建設，（六）爲國家收支的調節。所有財政·金融·物價·工資·置易·生產·運輸等部門，均已包括在內；而且除掉消極的管制而外，兼及積極的輔助和建設。在經濟行政上，無疑地，這是一個重大的措置。</p>
<p>原案第十五條載明：有須另定詳細規條者，由行政院各主管部會釐定辦法，送由行政院核定，分別以命令公布施行。上文各條所舉，自屬粗枝大葉，僅不過規定了一個輪廓和原則：至於在這個輪廓內，各項原則如何分別實施，還待各主管部會的釐定，而我們所認爲値得注意和研討的，也就是這些實施的辦法。</p>
<p>其實，除徵購徵用須看動員的情形如何，隨時決定外，其餘各項，並非沒有現成的辦法。例如囤積居奇一項，在經濟緊急措施方案中，已連帶恢復了非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法；其日用品的管制，則訂有民生日用必需物品供應辦法實施細則；其各種生產事業的調節和管理，則又恢復了非常時期農礦工商管理條例，而關於物價工資兩項，更有取締違反限價議價條例，和評議工資辦法，可資遵循；金融和財政兩項，在緊急措施方案中，也都有明白的規定。又生產貸款的推行，農田水利的舉辦，各種新訂章則，隨時可見。且除了中央所頒法令以外，各地方政府，隨時隨地，所訂關於取締物價，取締投機操縱，取締出境，轉口一類的辦法，更屬指不勝屈。</p>
<p>現在各種中央法令和地方單行章則，並沒有明文廢止，今動員戡亂，另訂實施綱要，是不是另起爐灶，軍新制定一套？抑或率由舊章，仍把現行法令沿用下去？或更增訂補充，力求完密，以加强其施行的效力？在現在，雖都還在未可知之數，但我們爲擁護戡亂，促進動員起見，却不得不希望當局對於這些法令再澈底地考慮整理一番。因爲我國今天的經濟危機，如何克服，已經不是有無法令的問題，而是法令是否太感繁複。以及執行是否切實的問題。</p>
<p>從大體說來，以前這些法令推行的結果，有許多不能不說是失敗或是失望的。試看各地對於取締囤積，取締物價，何嘗不是根據這些法令，但事實上，囤風愈熾，漲風亦愈猖獗，與法令之繁多適成正比，這是衆目昭彰的事。又如國家銀行費盡氣力，貸出了千百億鉅款來浦勇生產，輔助出口，輔助農民，國家更特設了若干機構，來推行這些輔助的工作，而工商反似益形衰落，農村更日趨崩潰，出口貨不等到出口，已經漲過了火，出口貿易依然迫於停滯。從可知這些輔助，至少在事實上並沒有擊中了要害，而收到預期的效果。至於調和勞資，嚴禁怠工罷工，停業關廠，及其他妨碍生產及社會秩序之行爲，在當局固早經三令五申，不啻舌敝唇焦，其奈言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，迄今不聽調解，不服仲裁的工潮，還是此起彼伏，層出不窮。這並不能說是法令不具，實在從某些人的心理看來，似乎法令是一回事，實際止的行動又是一回事。人民的心理與政府的期望，成了分道揚鑣，以致許多行動，越出軌外，牛毛法令，成了具文！這是今日　　問題上最大的病根，也是實施總動員時所應當克服的最大困難！</p>
<p>這些困難，究應如何加以克服呢？第一，自然應從人事入手，第二，還該從法令本身做起。今且姑置人事問題不談，專談法的問題。</p>
<p>現行各種經濟上的法令，其最大的弊病，實爲太多而太亂，其次爲太嚴而又太不合理，再其次則爲太輕率，太流動，幾令人民有朝令夕改的想法。</p>
<p>試舉幾個例來證明。拿取締米糧來說：可以適用取締違反限價議價條例，可以適用取締囤積居奇辦法，可以適用農工商礦管理條例，當然，也可以適用違反糧食管理治罪暫行條例。法令旣如此之多，而寬嚴之間又相去逕庭，最重的，可以適用軍法，如果要從輕發落，卻不妨用行政處分，而同一案件，某部分旣處以行政處分，另一部分還須移送司法，如此錯綜複雜，於是當事人惘然了，辦案的，也不得不煞費周章了。而其結果則犯法的人不免就存心逍遙於法外。這就是太多太亂的實例。</p>
<p>再拿囤積居奇來說，除　地方性的種種罰則三條（一）那麼，望文生義其實非大量購存的，自然應該不逄違法。但購存到　種數目，方算大量呢？法律上卻又滑有明文可講。又載：儲存物品，不應市銷售，而抬價超過合法利潤者，為居奇行為，前項合法利潤，由主管官署，斟酌當地情形，隨時規定之。（第四條）照此條文，凡抬價未超過合法利潤，或雖已超過而主管官署並沒有爲這許多物品隨時規定其合法利潤時，究竟算不算　成居奇行爲呢？應不應該加以罰辦呢？這似乎也是個疑問，又按照該法第九·十三·十五等條，凡生產·購存·或銷售此類物品的，必須每次或按期向同業公會登記或報吿，公會除依法轉報外，並須隨時檢查糾正。其手續竟如此瑣碎，拿上海市的情形來說，事實上是否辦得通？主管機關有沒有這許多人員來加以覆核，檢查，和糾正？如果沒有這覆核檢查和糾正的功夫，而一槪歸卷歸檔，束之高閣，試問要商人辦理這許多手續子。</p>
<p>本年二月六日，實施出口補助制度，至同月十七日頒佈經濟緊急措施方案時，卽予以取消：財政部於二月廿日訂定銀樓業及首飾店金飾處理辦法，亦以扞格太多，旋於三月廿三日另訂銀樓業收兌及製造金飾管理辦法。其他若紗布內運之忽緊忽馳，公用事業補貼辦法之忽作忽輟，自存外匯結購洋貨之忽許忽駁，以及生活指數之忽而凍結與忽而解凍，其有效期間之持續，多者不過兩三月，少者不過四五天，雖以物價波動太烈，情勢變遷太速，在當局不得不因時制宜，但在民間看來，終不無朝令夕改之感。其打擊人民守法的心理，以及國家法令的威信，實在是不小的。這都是立法時過於輕率的例證。</p>
<p>因此，我們主張：如果要求管制生效，動員生效，那麼，這些法令實有加以澈底地清查和整理的必要。凡屬矛盾的，重複的和不合事理的部分，必須痛痛快快地予以刪改，歸併，和簡化，務使眉目清楚，整齊劃一，然後執行法令和遵守法令的人，方纔一目了然，不至發生臨事周章的麻煩。漢高祖的約法三章，雖未必能行之於今日，但經濟法令之宜簡單明瞭，實在無可置辯。倘或須另起爐灶，重新釐訂，那麽，這些形格勢禁的法令，最好一舉而摧陷廓清，明白予以廢止：萬不可形同積薪似的疊床架屋，愈眾愈多，使奉公守法的良民，荊天棘地，到處有觸犯禁令的危險，而一般不肖的官吏，轉可利用這些複雜性和矛盾性，從而上下其手，資為利藪。這是經濟管制轉捩的關鍵，也是總動員方案成敗之所繫，我們認為值得重視的。</p>

<h3>提高德工業生產水凖　英美意見仍紛歧　英尙未允參加華府談判</h3>
<p>〔路社倫教十七日電〕外交部發言人稱，美國邀英在華盛頓討論魯爾煤產，英國尙未表示接受。倫敦方面粗信英國之未曾表示接受，係因希望會談範國得以擴大之故。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十八日電〕英國建議在德國英美合併區之開支由美國負担大半，頃已遭華國斷然拒絕。同時美國又拒絕英國之另一原定於下星期在此間舉行之德國煤產會議將改在柏林舉行之建義。關於　國工業計劃之新水準，因英美意見之紛歧，仍在僵特中，美官方希望不久能克服一切困難。英美有無數分歧之處，若千爲關於基本之處理廳國問題，而目飾最使英國苦惱者，爲其必須有大量金元用於德國。自去年十二月兩區合併以來，兩國政府同意一切開支平均負担，此致英國希望美國能多加負担而終未得美國之允許。前任美國務鄕曾吿英外相貝文稱，如英國願意交換佔區，則美國可多付佔領費。按美國佔領　為　國最窮之區　，而英國佔領區則為德境之最實者，蓋其包括最富之魯爾工業區也。“飾美官方對英國已答覆仍爲如英國　意交換佔區，美國即可多負担佔領費。至於煤斤會議原在七月十一日宣佈，英國同意派遣代表團赴華盛頓開會，此後英國欲將會議範團擴展至包括兩區財政糧食局勢以及其他經濟問題，美國即嚴加拒絕。美國雖亦不反對與英國討論一切經濟問題，然目前美國認爲煤斤問題實爲最主要者。在未能設法增加煤斤生產前，實無暇顧及其他也，最後英國遂亦同意會議中祗討論煤斤問題矣。</p>
<h3>對德國問題　法重申立場</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十七日電〕歐洲經濟合作委員會本日舉行會議時，，荷蘭代表發言稱，德國之生產潛力凡未經利用者，均應加以利用，俾德國之工業生產力能提高至最大限度。法代表即該國外交部經濟司長亞爾芳當即起立答覆曰，若無充分之安全保證，法國決不容許德國工業之復興。法國政府認爲安全之需要，較諸德國之工業復興更爲重要，吾人今後工作時必須繼續考慮及此。</p>
<h3>美州長會議　支持馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社烏太州鹹湖城十七日電〕美國四十八州州長第卅九屆年會，已於今日閉幕，一致通過決議案，表示支持以建立世界和平爲目的之美國無黨派外交政策。決議案有謂：「美國之外交政策，超出黨派個人或政治動機以外，應永遠爲一美國之外交政策，代表美國至佳之政策，向世界各國顯示美國爲企求和平之國家，並一致決定維護美國公民所享有之不能移轉之權利及利益」。紐約州長杜威事後發表意見稱，此一決議案已使全國州長堅決爲政府完成世界和平之後盾，決不致被認爲孤立主義之宣書。州長會　此外並議決請國會制定美國靑年普遍軍訓之立法。</p>

<h3>邁里格號輪上命案　衣櫥中赫然一屍　咖啡館主葬身魚腹　美金八千不翼而飛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西人海爾密（C.　H.　Heilmeir），年前在本市虹口區內與人合夥開設「美國人咖啡館」（Yankee　Coffe），營業不惡，薄有積蓄。本年四月中，海爾密忽厭倦於上海生活，擬至新大陸另謀發展，是時適有邁里格輪（Mariag）自滬返美，海爾密識得輪上水手數人，乃與談妥充作「黃魚」，匿於輪中隨同赴美。於是，海爾密鄧將其咖啡館股份售與他人，得款八千美元，束裝上輪。</p>
<p>邁里格輪係一貨輪，出海未久，海爾密之屍體，一日赫然發現於一衣櫥中，其出售咖啡館股份所得之八千美金已不翼而飛。當時船上發現屍體後，水手咸稱不識其人，海爾密之屍體遂即海葬於大洋中。</p>
<p>事為加拿大警察局所聞，當邁里格輪於本月十七日駛抵蒙得里城時，即將涉有嫌疑之水手六人拘捕，經審問之下，其中兩人承認將海爾密當「黃魚」匿藏輪中，惟對於謀殺一節，則堅不承認。</p>
<p>此案現尚在偵查中，海爾密如何致死，尚係一謎，惟悉海爾密當時匿藏之衣櫥中，熱度在一百八十度以上，故海爾密之死，可能係受熱悶死。</p>
<h3>名相如實不相如　吳國楨何其多也</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市市長吳國楨，這是大家所熟悉的一個名字。</p>
<p>但是另外還有十四個和吳市長同名姓的，卻很少有人注意到。這些人物，雖然在小市民帬中，或許容易為人所忽略，但說起來形形色色，倒亦富有趣味。</p>
<p>最近中電一廠，看中了這個題材，把這十五位吳國楨，攝進了「上海之窗」的鏡頭裏，不久將與「青春河邊草」同時上映。</p>
<p>中電一廠由攝影師張宏康等分頭向各個吳國楨拍攝的時候，曾經煞費苦心，其中有幾位吳國楨，因為不明拍電影的真相，好多躱避了起來，有的當時嚇得面色發青，手中不知所措。有的更看到攝影師一隻手拿着一隻「怪東西」，一隻手拿着一張戶籍證，以為是來「捉人」了，嚇得死亦不肯承認。終算經過了幾翻解釋之後，這件事情才算圓滿解決。不過，幾位攝影師等到功成之日，已經是舌敝唇焦，精疲力竭了</p>
<p>這十五位吳國楨中，有二人現在已經離開了上海。一位是行年卅一的成衣匠（見圖十三），住在南市翁家支弄十八號，最近在他的老闆娘處標着一個會，拿到了錢後避往他的故鄉常州去了。他的老闆為了這事，正在跳腳呢！</p>
<p>一位是江蘇鹽城人，（見圖十四）卅六歲，在前年十月間才奇居上海的。他在戶籍表中填的是「江蘇省政府公務員」。可是現在他是到臺灣經商去了，他亦是其餘十四個吳國楨中，唯一受過大學教育的人。</p>
<p>這裏還有一位吳國楨，（見圖五）過去倒有點「來曆」原來在本年二月二十一日的那一天，他曾經被地院傳訊過，為的是他在去年十一月二日和十二月十五日先後向一個名陸治海的借過七十萬元，後來因為到期無法償還，被陸起訴。當時據他在庭上供，還是一個老闆階級，那時他在虹口漢陽路二百七十一號開設「如意館老虎灶」，大約後來並不太「如意」，現在改行了，在華德路東漢縣禮路口，擺設一個麵攤，其實小本經營，生意倒亦不惡。他是江蘇高郵人，三十八歲，住在上海已有八年的歷史。</p>
<p>曾經為了不明攝影真相，嚇得面色發青的吳國楨（見圖十一），他是在東有慎路九七六號楊正和　　店裏做夥計的，現年二十五歲，江蘇通州人，來上海已經三年了。</p>
<p>住在順島路五三七號的吳國楨（見圖八），過去一度當過警士，可是現在改行為攤販了在淮安路二八八號賣些洋廣雜貨和應時扇子的日用品。他是江蘇鹽城人，今年方二十一歲，自從「投槍從商」之後，據說很懂得「生意眼」，生活着實過得去呢！</p>
<p>一個還在樹基小學讀書的吳國楨，（見圖二）浙江餘姚人，年方十五歲，來上海已經八年，和他的家長吳誠德住在河濱大樓七樓十六號房，那天到他寓所攝影的時候，吳國楨剛剛到外面去買醬油了。一時他的母親，看見好多陌生人，到他家裏尋吳國楨，以為吳國楨在外面出了岔子，急得先問什麼事，後來說明了來意，方始釋然；談話間吳國楨亦已拿了一瓶醬油，高高興興的跳了進來了。</p>
<p>還有一位在上海電力公司做技工的吳國楨（見圖十二）二十二歲鹽城人。為了拍照，着實費過一番周折。最初由工會召開會議討論通過，繼又徵求了本人的意，最後再經過廠長和經理的允準，這才正式上了鏡頭。</p>
<p>來有一個小店員吳國楨，（見圖三）十七歲，浙江鎮海人，來上海三年了，現在南京西路七三三號湯生皮鞋公司做職員，一天到晚和前往購鞋的小姐太太們打交道，看！他手裏不是正拿着一隻女士式白皮鞋，笑瞇瞇地正在談生意經嗎。</p>
<p>在斜坡土路和厚里六號的榮昌布廠裏，一個做工的吳國楨（見圖六），他憑着半手工半機械的方式，正在梳理着棉紗線三十三歲的人。</p>
<p>還有一位小販吳國楨，（見圖七）住在廣西路西仁美里二號，廣東潮陽人，十八歲。他正在牆腳邊仔細的看流水賬，肚子在打算今天生意好不好。</p>
<p>最後，在馬路上，又迎面來了一位賣燒餅脆蔴花的呈國楨（見圖四），笑嘻嘻的，大約買賣做得還順手。他今年十七歲，讀過三年小學，住在路三和里對面一號的房子中，江蘇淮陰人，來上海亦有七個年頭了。</p>
<p>這裏，還有一位（見圖一），他是湖北建始人，四十五歲，北平清華大學畢業，美國格林內爾大學學士，潑林斯頓大學博士。家住安福路二〇一號，每日在江西路二〇九號辦公，這就是現任上海市長的吳國楨。</p>
<p>其餘的七位中，大名路一六五號皮件店的老闆（見圖十），是比較富裕的一個，他原籍上　縣，今年三十八歲。</p>
<p>有二位是「寫字間的朋友」，一個在中正東路一四五四號四〇九室做會計的，（見圖九）三十九歲，上海人，你看他西裝革履，一手夾着一枝香煙，一手在打算盤，一望而知是個很精明的人。一位是在美亞保險公司做職員的，（見圖十五）巧得很，亦是三十九歲，上海人，卻是打字機上的一把好手。</p>
<p>中電廠分頭攝影煞費苦心　舌敝唇焦曾鬧出許多笑話。</p>
<h3>黃金榮李麗華　亦有不少同名</h3>
<p>上海市民中，除有吳國楨十五人外，尚有同名英黃金榮者十人，其中包括木匠二人，皮匠一人，碼頭工人二人，商人二人，老虎灶工人二人。又與電影明星李麗華同名者，亦有十人之多，包括修指甲，助產士，舞女及家務者多人。此項統計工作，係警局戶籍科採用人像號碼分析法。檢出上述兩人之紙卡時，費時僅十分鐘耳。</p>

<h3>東北書荒嚴重</h3>
<p>〔大華社訊〕前此東北軍事情形緊張時，各大學曾紛紛澈退。本市各大書業在瀋陽長秦設立分局者，有商務，中華，正中，大東，開明，文化，獨立等家，以撤退甚感困難，而且影響當地敎育文化事業過鉅，因仍照舊營業，但業務因受戰事影響，異常冷落，尤以四平街及安東方面之存書及帳務，損失更鉅。近日東北常局及印刷業，雖有　印課本之議，亦以紙張缺乏，成本太昂，未能成爲事實。本市新進出版業對印製國定課本之宣傳雖烈，但資金短少，印數甚稀，更不敢冒險運往東北供應、。至商務，中華，正中等家，亦因運輸困難，且與田地政府未曾接洽妥愜，不明實際需要數量，如何供應，當在考慮之中。因此東北　荒情形，頗爲嚴重云。</p>

<h3>曁大圖書館　館舍分兩處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曁南大學圖書館，館舍分設二處，一處設在東體育會路，爲理　學院國書館，除專置理商學圖書外，近得數育部配給敵僞圖書三萬册，藉　戰時損失。學校當局正計劃建築能容四十萬册書庫五百人座位的　　室之　會。另一處在寶山路，爲文　學院圖書館，專置文法學圖書，除原有圖書三萬餘册外，近又應備東方雜誌全份，各省通志，各大學學報，中央研究院地質調查所刊物，美國　書館協會捐送一九四〇年至四六年關於文法類圖書雜誌多種，及交換到吧變省　書館贈送南洋圖書二十餘種。全部中西圖書，均已整理編目就緒。</p>

<h3>平師院院長袁敦禮　談民教育危機</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕出席敎育座談會之北平師院袁敦禮院長，頃語記者稱：今日之國民敎育，已面臨嚴重危機，據統計全國合格師資，尚不足五萬人，此因合格師資大量　業之結果。現在國民敎師，月入僅十五六萬元，實不若一大學生之獎學金，亦僅抵二普通機關中之工役所得。中央劃定國民敎育經費，由地方負責，但地方無力負擔，如浙江省應應國民敎育經費四百六十億元，但其全部預算僅四百億元，即全部撥充亦感不足。惟吾人認爲高等敎育，固應充實，然國民敎育更應挽救。如果一個國家無良好之國民敎育，何以能有良好之國民？</p>
<h3>魯教廳長向中央請准　教育救濟費五十億</h3>

<p>出席國際奧林匹亞委員會之我全國體育協進會總幹事董守義，業於日前自港搭機返國抵滬，昨董氏對國光社記者發表此行經過及感想如下：</p>
<p>本人於月前出國飛瑞典京城，參加國際奧林匹亞委員會議，事前曾與協進會理事長張伯苓氏數度晤洽，因事　國際，故決定出席，而該會我國委員尚有王正廷及孔祥熙二氏，均因事冗不克分身，乃由本人單獨前往。會期四天，主要任務，乃在通過一九五二年世運舉行地點，並確定業餘資格，各國對舉辦世運競爭自熱化，國計有五大城市參加競辦，携有大批印刷品照片及電影等宣傳品，洛杉磯市長並親自到塲，發表動人演辭，歐洲各國亦不甘示弱，結果芬蘭以十五票獲得一九五二年世運承辦權。至外傳本人要求一九五六年世運在我國北平舉行之說，完全不確，蓋觀乎上述各國競辦之情况，足證非本人一人所能貿然提出者也。會後本人順道至英倫，接洽我國出席明年世運之住宿及其他情事，逗留二週，然後返國云云。聞董氏定日內招待本市體育新聞界，報吿詳情，又本市體育協會亦將茶會歡迎董氏。</p>

<h3>羣聲返菲島　臨別勝馬華</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡十六日電〕菲律賓華僑所組織之羣聲籃球隊，在此已整一月，定明搭機返菲，該隊於昨夜與馬華隊作慈善賽，在一面倒局面下以六十六比三十六獲勝，門票收入四千　幣，於相除捐稅後，將全數撥充華南水災賬款。該隊在馬來亞與新加坡之十八塲比賽中，共勝十七塲，僅一塲小挫，一般認爲該隊人個人射籃準確，係致勝要素之一，此間之運動水準固商，然倘與羣聲相比，則不論在個人技術與全隊之平均發展方面，馬來亞球隊，均瞠乎其後。</p>

<h3>旅客携带國幣赴廣州　祇以五十萬元為限　超過數額須預繳等值保證金　呈驗粵關證明書後方可發還</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關頃對國幣之外運事，另有新規定。昨特公吿如次：案查凡由國內各地前往香港或其他國境以外地區旅客，每人携帶之本國貨幣，除領有財政部護照者外，不得超過國幣五抬萬元一事，前經於本年四月十六日以第一二八號布吿周知在案。茲層奉政府核定，凡由滬飛往廣州旅客，携帶現鈔超過國幣五十萬元，而未領有財政部護照者，應向本關繳納與所運鈔券價値相等之保證金，並請領准單，方准放行。上項保證金，於鈔券扺達廣州後，由粵海關騐明無訛，製給證明書，再由本關憑上項證明書及原發收據，如數發還。如所運鈔券，並未全部運抵廣州，或經本關騐封之原包裝查有拆動情事，或粵海關之證明書未能於飛機離滬後十四天內呈騐時，上項保證金，應予沒收，旅客所持保證金收據應即作廢。至詳細報運辦法，可至本關總務課總務股詢問。再出上海前往國內各地旅客，不論乘坐舟。車及飛機，除須經出香港或其他國外地區者，或如前述之由滬飛往廣州者，或搭乘非按照普通行輪章程行駛之民船或船隻前找鄰近外國口岸或地區者外，其携帶木國貨幣數額，目下並無限制。</p>
<h3>華股平庸多盤臨收略形堅定</h3>
<p>華股昨平庸而多盤，大體仍隨美亞爲進退。散戶心理見淡，浮空頗爲擁擠。近午得銀根大鬆之助。天戶若二三號及二三七號等買意轉殷，美亞低後反動回升。一部份活動份子，咸放棄信和而轉向美亞進襲，臨收時顯趨堅定。新光景福亦由二〇四號在開收時頻加吸收，午收亦易拉上，惜中途以大勢之所趨，異常鬆弛。</p>
<p>晨開見穩，美亞開後，一六〇號一九號一一〇號二一八號雖進，遞美亞微升爲五八五元。二二四號一四號一五二號一八〇號賣出，跌至五七五元。遞信和亦由二三一號七一號三二號八五號賣，到三七一〇元。即交信和則寂然未獲成交。九七號二二六號八五號將遞美亞拉上至五八三元，二一九號等亦進遞信和，而回升爲三七七〇元。一六五號一八六號一八〇號賣出，九一號進後亦出，遞美亞下降至五六九元。二二三號二一八號雖拉上十元，但一〇二號六九號一五二號二二三號九一號二三六號紛售，一八五號七六號乍進乍出，過程恍惚而仍疲。十時五十分，二四號一四二號八九號一〇三號力售，將遞美亞迫低至五六〇元。一八三號一三四號九七號八四號二四號亦脫售遞信和而跌至三五三〇元。此時最爲怯疲，新光景福亦都見低價。一四號一八〇號一五二號以及散戶俱進，十一時二十分，回升至五七三元而後略盤。嗣後銀根忍報鬆動，一六〇號六五號二三號一二號二二六號二三七號一六七號奮購，遞美亞升至五八〇元，現美亞亦達五六七元高價。現遞相差十餘元。一二五號金城銀行等套賣不已，六一號等亦有了結，稍有回低，遞信和由二二號一一〇號一五七號二二四號四號八四號一八五號買進，升至三六九〇元左右。此際大部活動份子，咸放棄信和而進美亞，於是臨收時美亞極爲穩定，而信和倍見鬆弛。收後　美亞喊價尙形穩建。結果較前收計即交股信和微降，美亞華豐各升半成弱，永公漲起一成，新光新華尙平，中法新亞微挫，景福勤興微升，火柴水泥升半成强，麗安五和平平，餘均微升而已。遞交股計信和微挫，永公漲半成，華豐美亞勤興景福微升，堪外各老股平疲而已。</p>
<p>永紗塲外昨老股喊價自一〇〇〇〇元，升至一〇三〇元結束。新股初開二一〇元，低至一九七元，而後以二一〇元及二一三元之價結束。息價二角一及二角五分半。</p>
<h3>棉紗市氣不振</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，晨開脚地尙堅，嗣以紡建開紗，各方進取平庸，又以同業銀根局部仍緊，市上零星吐售不寂，市價不支下挫。結果四二支藍鳳比上日回降五十萬元，爲一千七百七十萬元。特雙馬亦回挫二十萬，爲一千一百六十萬元。雙馬紗回小十萬，爲一千零七十萬元。其餘四十支卅二支二十支十六支光明等粗細紗，一致微跌二·二三萬至九，十萬元不一”</p>
<p>棉布續挺</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開平疲，旋以漢口客帮動辦，業外人再度力進，各方哄抬，市價回昻。結果十二磅龍頭細布收價比上日續漲一萬元，爲四十三萬八千元。五福彩球藍鳳陽鶴等各檔細布，亦均步升五六千至七八千元。漢口帮辦取色布及四君子嗶嘰，成交價爲四十八萬五千元，軋升一萬餘元。其餘漂布粗布斜紋及藍布士林布等亦頗堅穩。</p>
<p>紡建配紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡調會聯合配紗，共配九六七件，全部配予複製工業，申購者共四四六戶云。</p>
<h3>統債回疲外股轉漲</h3>
<p>公債昨漲後不能持久，臨收終被出籠所迫低。統丙晨開七千五，高價實迫近八千元大關，而復回低至七千元關邊結束、三六〇室五五五室有納，五三八室五五二室均售，成交約一百　萬。較前收計甲乙回小二百元丙跌四百元，丁降一〇〇元，戊種獨平。</p>
<p>外股昨得業外之刺激，重又回昂。廣帮及猶太商力進，證券帮觀望，北帮及錢兌業雖售，怡紗仍自六萬八拉高至七萬四收市。橡皮股稍形不振，英聯漲勢最爲有力，結果較之飾收計英聯獨漲一成有零，餘股各昂半成强。</p>
<h3>銀根已轉鬆動　國家行局差出六一三億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市票據交換所交換結果，四行兩局共差出六百十三億元，內中央銀行獨家差出二百七十億元。此外，外商銀行差入一百七十六億元，五十號前交換行莊差入三百七十億元，五十號後者差入六十七億元。銀根已轉鬆動暗息一角八分至二角。聞昨日國家行局鉅額差出主因，係華股中永紗停止交易後，證交市塲交易說减，且因週五交割關係，套利交易亦大爲减少，故五成證據金，亦紛紛抽出，乃造成國家行局之鉅額差出。又近日日華南套匯交易，經國行嚴加防範後，茲復以江海關公吿國幣輸往外埠之新規定，故套匯之風已歛，亦足减少本市現鈔之外流云。</p>
<h3>農行受押箱茶　茶商設法向外推銷</h3>
<p>售價可超過政府收購價格</p>
<p>收購茶業，中信局仍在準備中。由誘收購時間，原定二十日截止，四聯總處爲顧及茶商困難，決定展期五日。迄至目前爲止，中信局尙未接到任何茶商之申申請。據悉各茶商要求按五月份所議新價高百分之五十，國家行局認爲商人已有合法利潤，不能再事提高。因此各茶商正自行設＼法推動外銷，業與法商永興洋行治妥，屯綠百分之八十，已有成議，平綠亦正進行中。售價平均每公斤可高至美金一元四角，超過政府收購價格，故對政府之收購，不感與趣，農行受押之箱茶，已紛紛備款贖回云。</p>
<h3>茶葉去化呆滯</h3>
<p>昨茶茶市，各種內銷茶，除本街店莊續有添納外，餘若楓涇蘇錫一帶，受　雨繼綿影響，去化均仍停滯。惟據業中人云：一俟天時晴朗，走銷恐將激增。至於抽珍珍眉等各種外銷綠茶，貨方鑒於市上存底並不豐厚，售意咸帶堅化，刻下買氣雖猶絡繹，交易則依然式微，過程屹立如故。其他花色僅陳粗紅茶，午昌茶業公司尙在搜求，行情亦極量固。</p>
<h3>食米供過於求　粳秈上落甚少</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千七百餘石，市况平堅午懈，粳秈均少上落，形勢欲振乏力。白元中次仍呆，間漢口米價大跌，而無錫米麥雜糧到源奇旺，突破最高紀錄，堆棧已吿客滿，是以糧情暫續向榮。</p>
<p>麪粉因廠方出數不多，所辦小麥尙在途中，零化略動，廠粉統粉雜牌粉均見微挺千餘元，麩皮去化仍　，再疲千元。豆餅鄕銷有動，畧升一二千元，營口餅加三四千元，黃豆去化仍淡，長江來源尙接，東北略有到申，續跌三五千元。</p>
<p>豆豆消化不爽，再跌萬元。赤豆見疲三五千元，紅糧來去兩稀　，市勢平庸。苞米供多求少，市形平正。生仁連跌之後，消化轉殷，回挺三五千元。芝　供源略多，求者寥寥，猛跌一二萬元。蠶豆依然到湧銷細，步削三五千元。莞豆站局，小麥平定。</p>
<p>油市仍然漲跌互見，生汕豆油尙俏，回漲一二萬元。菜油于麻油走化呆木，下挫一二萬元，適成背道而馳。</p>
<p>桂圓步跌</p>
<p>桂圓近以去化呆滯，且飾市上漲過甚，近來回跌亦說，連日步降百分之三十弱，而受手仍少。</p>
<h3>四區絲織業公會申請　增加生產貸款額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市絲織業生產貸款，業經四聯總處核准，原則規定以每台織機貸款五百萬元，期限三個月，利息五分。茲四區絲織業公會方面，認爲貸款數額不敷應用，時於昨日下午一一時召開理監事會議，討論經過，決定再函呈四聯總處，將每台織機之貸款額，增加至一千五百萬元。此外議案有二：（一）請中信局對人造絲，勿採標售方式，仍望繼續配售。（二）輸管會分配之人造絲限額，刻該會正徵求各會員意見中，俟意見彙集後，再行分配云。</p>
<h3>蠶絲產銷協導會　今開十二次會議</h3>
<p>農經兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，定今（十九）日晨十時，召開第十二次委員大會。據悉：除對秋種浸酸發種日期，加以決定外，關於第三區練絲工業工會，要求爾貸中一成資金，及百分之十利潤，均折合發給生絲或僅八成解繳實物，以償還全部　貸問題，亦將提出商討。預料此提案當引起熱烈爭辯。按當初繭貸原則，規定貸款廠商繅成生絲，應由政府全部收購，而目前市塲原料枯竭，維持內銷亦爲當前急務，該會決定時或將採取折衷辦法。</p>
<h3>對日易貨人造絲　下月起可望運到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央信讬局息，（一）該局辦理對日易貨人造絲，在本月及八九兩月中，可陸續分批運到。故對配售量亦可望，較前充裕。配售辦法昭舊，調整配價事，則須待吳局長返滬後，方能決定，大致下週一可有端倪。</p>
<p>停收猪鬃</p>
<p>（二）該局自辦理收購桐油豬鬃以來，桐油之收購量頗豐。猪鬃已收若干，惟現因改進收購價格關係，暫停收購云。</p>
<h3>工商貸款銀團　正式宣告結束</h3>
<p>中央銀行去年舉辦軍貼現轉抵押貸款，以扶助小型工業生產及出口商輸出貿易。當由中交等三行二局會同商業銀銀行錢莊合組工商貸款銀團，計銀行三組，錢莊五組，共貸出九十九億五千九百九十萬元。棉紡各業貸款單位計四百十八家。本年四乃，國行設立貼放委員會後，銀團業務即轉移辦理，銀團所有貸款，至本月七日止，已全部收回淸結。工商貸款銀　，乃於本星其正式宣吿結束．</p>
<h3>現棉穩定</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市況仍疲，交易不多，買戶因棉紗繼續下挫，進意鬆懈，咸多觀望。本街紗廠頗有　疲殺價，致賣戶不願賤售，故交易反趨冷落，惟市價在前兩日止漲回跌後，昨市已站穩定。各檔做開送廠價計通州一八四萬，又棧交價計　賓二一二萬，二一五萬至二一七萬，沙市二〇四萬，漢口細絨一九〇萬，一九五萬至二〇三萬，歸德一九二萬，　米特林二〇五萬，浦東火機一七〇萬，周浦籽花每組三二萬五千。</p>
<h3>捲煙交易轉旺</h3>
<p>昨日捲　市況，　　　天雨連綿，到者不多，成　頗淸，旋因門莊帮零星吸　見佳，市氣　穩。午市塲內人數較衆，業中逢低拖進，交易轉旺，做價挺升。最後十支大英烟價，比上日繼漲十四萬元，爲八百九十二萬元。老刀牌爲七百六十五萬，亦升十萬。五華六百八十五萬，札升六七萬。</p>
<p>全日趨勢，高等烟因套買頗多·三砲台六萬九千五百元，大南未八萬二千元，尙雜補是進。其他華商烟美麗金　百萬金白蘭地克雷斯紅金十字軍等牌條烟，午市去化活潑，做價挺升，自五百元至二千五百元。美貨駱駝六根馬力斯等條烟，及聽裝烟走勢仍淸，而外洋到貨不寂，頗有斬售，致價不振下挫云。</p>
<h3>開放對日貿易問題　工商界主採連鎖辦法</h3>
<p>盟軍總部決定於下月中旬開放對日私人貿易，恢復中日通商之消息傳佈後，滬上工商界已予極大之重視。歛認國國需要進口物資，大有出入。且日是方宣稱將自下月中旬起至本年底止，自我國獲得美金五千萬元之貿易。際此我國工商凋蔽，成本昻貴之秋，欲與之競爭，實感困難，因此有一部份人士之意見，主張實行連鎖辦法，以對日出口物資，換回國內需要之工業原料及人造絲等。又有人主張採用津貼制度者，但大多數工商界人士則認採用連鎖辦法，較爲妥當云。</p>
<p>吳蘊初主張應從嚴管制</p>
<p>〔中央社本訊〕全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初氏，昨對重開中日貿易事發表意見，認爲在目前情况下，恢復中日貿易對我國工業之發展，非徒無益，抑且有害。因日本商品之價格必較我國商品爲廉，則日貨之進口，勢將予我民族工業以嚴重之打擊。故渠主張政府對開放中日貿易，應予從緩考慮。渠又表示政府州設若決定如期開放，則對輸入日貨，必須嚴格管制，務使我國工業生產，不致蒙受損失。渠並主張未來中日貿易應中國家經營，利益歸公，以免豪商巨富操縱壟斷。渠謂工業協會定下週四開會，商討中日恢復貿易問題，會後將向政府提供意見云。</p>
<p>有若干商品可對日銷售</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據商會秘書長壽景偉表示：赴日商務代表之遴選辦法，尙在經部研討之中，發表有待。原則上可能爲一稱商品，產生代表一人，至於我國適宜於輸日之商品究有若干，則尙待調查。我國希望自日本輸入者，不外爲機器零件及工業原料。監察委員之反對恢復日本私人貿易，在政治上極有見地；但在經濟方面言，我國有若干商品只能在日本銷售，同時如其他各國與日本恢復商務而我國獨採消極態度，亦非上策。</p>
<h3>銀行業公會　大會日期決定</h3>
<p>昨舉行十五次理監聯會</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀行業同業公會第十五次理監事聯席會議，於昨日下午二時起，在該會會址舉行。到理監事四十餘人，由理事長李馥蓀主席，討論至四時卅分散會。</p>
<p>昨日報吿事項，有財政部令，中央銀行，市商會等公函等八十五件。討論事項，有所得稅案及努力認購美金債券四千萬美元等案九件。此外關於第十四屆會員大會事項，討論如次：（一）定期七月廿六日下午二時假市商會舉行。（二）本會卅五年年終決算賬表，請監事會定期蒞會查核證明。（三）核定會務書面報吿。（四）核定修正業規規最後草案，照原莫案增訂第十章存款或質押物等之繼承一章。（五）審查各會員提案。（六）討論本會關於勸銷美金債券提案。（七）討論穩定本會經費案。（八）其他事件</p>
<h3>民國卅六年度　我國棉花供需狀況</h3>
<p>— 施鑫泉</p>
<p>我國棉花生產，戰前曾達一千三百萬担。戰後以糧食缺乏，交通梗阻，生產成本高昂，棉農不願植棉，一度劇退。民國卅四年减至五百萬担，卅五年增爲七百四十萬担，然距離戰前水準仍遠。</p>
<p>本年新棉不久即將登塲，據農林部調查卅六年度播種期間，天氣尙好，各省棉田均有增加，佔計棉田面積爲三千九百零四十萬畝，如以每畝平均生產皮棉二十五斤計算，本年棉產佔計可達九百七十萬担。年份棉田（千畝）產量（萬担）</p>
<p>廿六年五九、三一六一、二七二</p>
<p>卅四年二二、七九六　五〇〇</p>
<p>卅五年二二九、四一八　七四三</p>
<p>卅六年三九·〇四〇　九七四</p>
<p>紡錠設備年來尙乏顯著變動，全國共計四百五十萬枚，惟因電力不足，零件缺乏，迄未完全開工。現在平均開工率約百分之八〇，即運轉三百六十萬枚。</p>
<p>茲以統扯紡製二十支紗言，每錠每天開工二十小時，需用棉花一磅，每月工作二十六日，錠需原棉二十六磅，每年需三百十二磅。三百六十萬錠共需十一萬二千三百二十萬磅，合一千零二十一萬担，即需棉花二百二十六萬八千包。</p>
<p>卅五年度棉花產量佔計旣爲九百七十萬担，惟其中棉絮棉衣之需，與手工紡織業之銷費，全國年需二百二十五萬担。又手工棉紡織業用棉約爲二百五十萬担，兩需棉花四百七十五萬担，留存棉農中之存棉約爲五十五萬担。故本年可供紡織業用之棉花約爲四百四十萬担，即九十九萬七千包。</p>
<p>棉花存底據農林部調查，冀鄂等十省存最共計一百十四萬担，再加上海市六十四萬担，共計一百七十八萬担，合卅九萬包。</p>

<h3>中國汽車製造公司　作孤軍的奮鬥　呈光明的遠景</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者繩治</p>
<p>（本報訊）中國汽車製造公司，近向美國貸款美金五百萬元，購買整套製造汽車之新機械。此項貸款業已獲得我國最高當局之担保，俟行政院批准結匯，即可交貨。如是，我國汽車製造業行將作進一步的重大貢獻。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，我們不能埋沒了工業界的一番業績，在埋頭苦幹的情形下，大大小小的替國家着實加添出不少力量來。回憶到過去在後方的幾條殘破的公路上，雖然是表面上由幾輛「其貌不揚」的柴油木炭車在行走，但骨子裏這倒純粹是自己的心血，在當時遭遇到被封鎖的惡劣環境下，亦就靠了這」點，才沒有失去大動脈的活力</p>
<p>倒下去爬起來</p>
<p>說起了汽車，不由得聯想到當時幹汽車工廠的一番苦幹精神，在戰時顚沛流離的形勢中，屢次倒了下去，但接着亦就屢次爬了起來。當時出現在後方，作孤軍奮鬥的一家中國汽軍製造公司，亦正是全國工業界千百部門中苦幹份子之一。那時候大家或者給「馬達」響，黃金萬兩」的一代倖運兒司機們瞇住了眼，反而把幕後苦幹的工作人員忽視了過去。那時，誰會想像得到司機們在花天酒地的當兒，部正是工程師們在實騐室中吃靑菜淡飯的時候呢！</p>
<p>遷桂良造零件</p>
<p>說起這一支異軍，中國汽車製造公司的歷史不能不簡簡單單的從頭講起。原來「中汽」遠在民國廿三四年間早已成立，廠址就在上海的高昌廟。當時大家滿懷熟望，正在興沖冲的時候，「一二八」戰役帶米了一個大打擊，終算那時還可託租界之庇護，機器沒有受到損害，不過，在工作展開上部因此受到了相當的阻得。公司方面當時感到外力的壓迫，爲求一勞永逸計，於是在株州與鐵路總機廠合組了一個「聯廠」，等到一切齊備，正預備進行發電工作的時候，不料「八一三」戰事接踪而爆發，不久漢口吿緊，株州動搖，於是又將剛剛裝好的機器，重新拆卸下來，搬到桂林良豐去，才算勉强立住了脚，開始製造了一部份的零件出品。</p>
<p>在九龍造汽車</p>
<p>「中汽」一面在內地逃難，一面却仍在向外洋總續訂購機器，爲了取得補充材料的便利，便在九龍荃灣成立了「南華鐵工廠」，論規模，在當時國內車工業界中，已是算得上數一數二的一家。自己製造引擎，自己製造汽車，爲國內汽車界中初次放出一朶燦爛之花。</p>
<p>廠破產剩空穀</p>
<p>國家的多難，使工業界受到嚴重的威脅。太平　戰事爆發時，中國留在海外的一點精華，幾乎全部破了產。「中汽」當然不能例外，南華鐵工廠中重要的機器三百餘件，全給日軍擄掠了去，至此，「南華鐵工廠」名存實亡，幾乎剩下一個空壳子。</p>
<p>南華廠在戰事發生以前，已經有了出品，當二百餘副引擎和大批零件運到車慶以後，尚有更大批的零件，堆存在仰光，臘戍，遮放一帶，終因那時的戰事「一面倒」，在惠通以　的物資、使來不及撤退，又金部　牲光了</p>
<p>修配廠在重慶</p>
<p>幸而這二百餘具引擎及時運到了重慶，這在後來的運　上，確實發揮了不少的力量。</p>
<p>緊接　國軍自湘　撤退，一中汽」祗剩下了重慶最後的一個據點。終算那時還有一部份機件，工作得以繼續進行，成了後方一個主要的修配廠。</p>
<p>渝分廠闢新蹊</p>
<p>勝利了，大家復了員。「中汽」有一個遠大的計劃，除了準備恢復自製汽車外，更爲了適應現時的迫切需要，將留在重慶的分廠，由重工業轉入了輕工業，改組成了「紡織機械公司」，爲貧乏的工業界，另闢了一條新途徑。</p>
<p>造紗錠求改進</p>
<p>重慶的公　司改組後，即開始大量製造紗錠，最近替上海中紡公司定做了一萬餘隻錠子，大約在下月問，就可全部交貨。經過與日本的「三社式」對照試騐結果，比例是八十二分對九十一分，成績已能够得上標準，現在仍努力繼續改進，精益求精，期望在第二批出品中，可以與舶來品相頡頑，或甚至勝過它們。</p>
<p>目前重慶方面的好多小紗廠，都己採用了自製的錠子，裕豐紗廠就是其中之一，不過裕豐的錠子是美國式，差別在於美國紗錠個子大，在應用靈活方面，反而不及日本式。（日本式係依照英國標準所仿製）</p>
<p>向西南謀發展</p>
<p>照紡織機械公司的計劃，今後的業務發展，將全部注重在西南各省。希望能做到各地各有自製的紡織廠。不過，照現在的出品成績看來，每月單做錠子，可達到二萬錠至四萬錠，如果做整套的機器，每年還祗可做到二三萬錠子的模樣，剛剛够得上內地一個小規模紗廠之用。</p>
<p>製引擎利農業</p>
<p>此外廠裏還附帶製造些一二汽缸　　　　　在農業方面的如何　，　米，鋸本，營造，消防等等，但因爲目下一般農民的智識程度還不够，一時還不能普遍推廣。</p>
<p>在戰時剩下來的一部份引擎，因爲勝利後，大批現成汽車蜂湧而入幾乎全部失去了時效，於是這批引擎再度經過研究改良後成了輸船上的發動機，當時好多復員東下的廠商，不少就靠這一點動力，解決了當時運輸上的困難</p>
<p>被刦物交涉中</p>
<p>再說到流落在九龍荃灣的「南華鐵工廠」，當時機器雖然給日本人據雲了，廠房却還好好的保存着。最近開工的部份，僅是翻砂和修理，與過去的規模相較之下，已有「不可同日而語」之感。不過，以前被日軍擄去的三百餘件機器，現在已經在日本查獲了下落，正在向麥帥總部交涉中，可能在不久的將來，全部交回來。</p>
<p>工程師赴美國</p>
<p>「中汽」在勝利以後曾經派出六位工程師，在美國各廠實習。同時並向美國貸款五百萬美金，訂購了全　製造汽車的母機，不過。美國的條件，需要我國政府担保當時雖然經最高當局批准了，但爲了按照官價結匯的關係，尚　置在行政院中，如果這事沒有多大困難的話，則明後年就可能有出車的希望了。</p>
<p>滬廠址考慮中</p>
<p>過去在上海高　廟的老廠址，現在一部份尚為海軍方面借用着。將來這批機器運到後，廠址的問題，尚是僅得考慮的一件事。株州方面的廠址，在戰事中沒有受到大損害，依據過往的經騐，在內地設廠，或許可以蛟海上安全些。最後站在中國貧乏的工業界中展望着可喜的遠景，我們覺得過去的一番艱苦奮鬥的精神，似乎還需要我們不　不撓地堅持下去哩！</p>
<p>「中汽」一面在內地逃難，一面在九龍荃灣設立了「南華鐵工廠」，自己製造汽車等項，爲國內汽車界放出一片異彩！</p>

<h3>嶺大附中　學生弑師　推翻真相　前供待偵</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>主任引咎辭職·教廳嚴予處理</p>
<p>廣州十四日航訊</p>
<p>以廣州的最　學府來說，恐忙除了中山大學之外，要　嶺南大學歷史最修久了。數十年來，它曾經造就了不少人材，而且敎學學校所有優良的　　精神，他們都保留着。裏面不論大學本部，以及附中附小各部的學　，大都　門　　的子弟，他們　衣足食，學風也一向最好，不　事，不罷課，雖然他們有「嶺南牛」的稱號，但除了在運　塲　有時表現出一點牛性以外，平時都是循規蹈矩的。不幸得很，在個平謐的氣氛裏，這個素享盛舉的學府，竟突然發生了轟動全國駭人廳聞的殺師案。</p>
<p>當事件發生時，記者曾先後以電訊報導經過，但這事件雖隔旬日，曾有三學生自首，可是主犯在逃，這案實仍未算是吿一段落。而且不僅是偶人的生死問題，實在關聯到整個敎育制度與社會風氣，因此記者特將事件的內慕，再作詳細的報導。</p>
<p>拳如雨下脚踢腰背</p>
<p>事件的發生，是在六月二十八日晚上，那時已經放了暑假，祗留高中三十多名學生在校裏溫習功踝，準備考畢業試。因爲蔡輝甫光生是附中的敎務主任兼高三的此學敎員，那晚便被學生們　請去替他們補習化學蔡氏爲人和藹可親，但對學生則從不肯寬縱而誤其前途，因高三班的化學課本內習題有六十條，由高一至高三ABC三本，則合共有一百條，其中有五分之一是因抗戰疏散時沒有敎過的，故學生要求這部份免考，將習題减爲四十條，而蔡氏以爲這是校方議定的，個人不能作主，同時勸誠他們，說畢業試祗不過是一個形式，縱使這樣遷就而畢業了，但老大學試還是不行的，並勉勵他們多溫習使有辦法。怎知這話剛說完，忽然學生叢中，笛子長鳴，同時電燈全部熄滅，怪聲大響，蔡即搶步出敎室，擬下樓離去，詎料黑暗中已拳如雨下，沿三樓扭毆至二樓，擾亂中更突被一脚踢向腰背，於是站立不牢，由二樓鋼梯連跌八級，至樓下間的梯台。學生們知已肇禍，也就悄然散去。</p>
<p>預防桌枯佈置陰謀</p>
<p>當時大約是晚上十時三十分左右，該校的電燈工匠發覺全座課室電燈熄滅，遂擬上二樓查探開關總苖，首先發覺入門處，有人預放一課室所用連桌帶椅之鷄籠橋置在梯口，到梯台即發現蔡氏斜倒地上，遂將其扶起，然後再視開關箱，則發現箱門已被撬破，總開關掣上縛有童軍繩一條，大約是當時用作拉開電掣的。同時在電箱之旁，原爲一敎師宿舍，而該宿舍門口，亦有人預放了一張桌椅，有企圖阻止室內人出來援救模樣從這看來，他們歐辱敎師，似乎是有預謀的跡象！</p>
<p>叮囑家人勿向外宣佈　僅稱：「學生打我！」</p>
<p>蔡氏的宿舍，離出事地點不及五十碼，本不須三分鐘即可到達，但當時蔡氏在十二時始返抵寓所。據蔡夫人張碧茵說：當時蔡已痛楚不堪，整夜嘔吐，祇說：「學生打我！」餘未言及，並囑家人勿向外宣佈，免失敎師然嚴。翌晨，傷勢趨重，便用救護車送入城內救治，至十一時便因傷重斃命了！</p>
<p>夫人懷孕遺孤堪憐</p>
<p>蔡氏是廣東揭陽縣人，現年四十六歲，幼小家貧，以小販爲生，半工半讀，當時在鄉間浸信會的牧師姚先生，以蔡天資聰頴，遂資助其至海縣廣益中學肄業，勤苦攻讀，每試亂列第一，後再資助至上海滬江大學物理系，仍半工半讀，得物　學士位，再赴菲二律賓大學深造，得物理學碩士。返國後任滬大物理學助敎，武昌博文由學校長等職。民廿七至嶺大附中行教，以成績優良，提升為教務主任，迄今憶乘十年。今不幸如此犧牲，身後蕭條，為狀至慘，遺孤三子一女，蔡夫人尙懷孕在身，我們也可想像到蔡夫人悲傷的程度了！</p>
<p>三人自首主犯在逃</p>
<p>事件因事關命案，警方便派人將將該班全體學生看管，惟亭歷三日，仍無頭緒，且在看管期中，有該班學生沈志祖（漢奸沈毅之猶子）已潛逃。後至七月七月日，法院派了檢察官書記官各五名會同警局督察警士多名，及敎育　姚廳長實　等，窮整日之力偵訊，用盡了種種勸導方式，姚廳長並作了半小時的訓話，鼓勵犯罪者白　，並謂「勇於認過，是靑年應有的行爲，中其動機恐　因一時衝動而己！」在這勸諭之下，各生感動至痛哭流涕，卒有龔金洲，關輝明，杜焜業等三人自首，龔自承開電掣箱之鎖，關供滅電掣，杜供曾擊蔡一拳；並有劉尚志代沈志祖自首，供出沈乃主兇。法院　將該三生帶回審訊，劉尚志則囑其迅即轉知沈志祖迅予投案自首，其餘各生可即日恢復自由，但他們的畢業考試，也就因此擱淺，要等待敎應的批示才舉行。</p>
<p>在押三生推翻前供</p>
<p>此案總算是有了端倪，不過七日法院開庭偵查，在押三生忽又推翻前供，祗認初供不過激於義憤，免全體同學受扣押之苦而己，所以眞相如但，尚够耐人尋味哩。</p>
<p>至校方當局對這事後的處理，此間一般輿論，頗有微詞，因爲經過該校校董會的秘密會議，對死者家屬，仍未有確切保障證明。至學生方面，該校校長李應林（現兼行總粵分署長）則强調學生犯罪，乃個人問題云云。但該自首學生杜焜榮的家屬，則稱該生自小學二年級起，即在嶺大附小寄宿讀書，數年來隨學校搬遷，渠的的確確一切是由嶺南培養長成的，這次學校應該也有責任。而此間某敎育家亦謂：此事件之發生，實由於訓育失敗，負該校訓育責任者，應負全責。</p>
<p>校中主任引咎辭職</p>
<p>因此，該校附中的主任與訓育主任，都已引咎亂職，但是否獲准，則恐怕還要待校董會予以決定。</p>
<p>誠然，造慘案已不僅爲一敎育問題，抑且爲一極嚴重之社會問題。在多年抗戰中，學校流轉播遷，學生　度大見退落，而因社會風氣影響，道德觀念亦隨之低降，前途尤感可怖。所以省文化會頃對這案致敎廳的函中也說：「此不幸之慘案，不獨有乘吾國數千年來尊師重道之旨，且開學生作亂犯上之風，其對者國世道人心之遷盤影　，豐不下於殺人放火之共產黨，　菲嚴辦，　　害窮……」</p>
<p>教廳表示嚴正處理</p>
<p>至敎憲對有處理辦業，大要是：（一）犯罪學生沈志　等四名及學生代表劉尚志，岑叫孝二名，一律開除學籍，學生代表開除原因是此事發生後處理失當；（二）該班全班學生除肇事晚間未到上課者外一律記大過一次；（三）其他學生如有犯罪行爲者，由校方分別查明輕重，予以處分；（四）已解法院之學生，另由法院審判罪狀。並抽姚　畏稱：太案的始末，已呈報敎育部備案，至渠個人對此案之表示，則稱：「極爲痛心　遺憾，此不能　言乃敎育之失敗，對犯罪學生，則絕不能姑息，吾人要正視醜惡，嚴正處理。」並稱：「希望敎育制度，將由疑先生之遭受犧牲而獲　機。」</p>

<h3>猪瘟　蔓延台島</h3>
<p>— 本報記者楊育</p>
<p>台北四日航訊</p>
<p>去年十一月下旬，記者向讀者介紹台灣淡水獸疫血淸製造所時，還記得末了這樣寫：「這個機構雖然耗費財力，可是它的力量却値得重　」。希望常局給予有力的援助。時至今日事實給了我答覆：整個海島正在蔓延着可怕的豬疫，而該所爲經費所限，製造的血淸疫苗量，僅及各縣需要量的十之一。事前不能防，事後無法治，造成了海島農家一個嚴東的新威脅。</p>
<p>牛瘟疫</p>
<p>幸未發生</p>
<p>過去本省農民一遇豬瘟，只要疫使趕到，老百姓會習慣地牽出所有的猪隻接受注射，但目下海港檢疫不澈底，走私的猪隻帶來了疫菌，極容易地染給了台島毫無抵抗力的雜種猪；政治防疫不健全，防疫行政實若虛，有若無，再加血淸疫苗無法大量供應，據統計光復以來死亡於疫癘的猪隻，至少有數十萬頭。</p>
<p>合大副敎授劉榮標博士曾以兩星期的時間，調查了全省獸疫的情形：已經絕滅了近二十年的最可怕的牛瘟，總算沒有發生，否則台灣半數以上的牛隻可能斃死，影響農村耕作，食量增產，這就不堪設想了。不久前善救總署曾遝到一批乳牛，當時繫留於台北郊外朱厝崙牧塲達一月之久，施以嚴密的檢疫，結果牛瘟及焦虫病尚未發現，但內中十三頭却患有以前台省所沒有過的牛虻症（Hypodermabovis），經澈底驅除，己吿安全。</p>
<p>屠宰場</p>
<p>主要媒介</p>
<p>猪疫中以猪瘟，猪肺疫，副腸勢病最猖獗，其次是猪丹毒的散發流行。最有走私猪隻停留在海岸一帶，猪疫乃以此為源地，逐漸侵入內陸一帶，現在已步步向山地進迫。這些傳染病不僅使猪隻招致消滅的厄運，也有相當程度可以感染到人體。農家秘密宰殺病猪供食或買賣，就更增加了人爲猪病的機會。據劉博士調查檢騐了四個屠宰塲，他認定所屠宰的猪隻，百分之百是　有猪瘟及猪肺疫，然而現在沒有檢查的法規，也沒有專責檢騐的獸醫，屠案塲鑒成傳染病的主要媒介。</p>
<p>猪隻不　死亡，固然肉食會生恐慌，農家的糞肥也難以獲得，但尤其是種母猪的斃命，連今後的繁殖多會絕望。在國內也許因為土地太廣袤的關係，猪疫是被忽視的，但在這個小小的海島上，却成了一件大事，沒有一個農家不焦慮。</p>
<p>談增產</p>
<p>澈底防疫</p>
<p>對策不是沒有，嚴密實行海港檢疫，防止走私；緊急撥付血清疫苗增產的大量經費；防疫行政第一步從鄉鎮公所着手。以前台灣食糧政策之得有　礎，家畜防疫的澈底也是個因素，現在處理得更迫切了。</p>
<h3>聯合國兩年工作新檢討（二）</h3>
<p>七月八日滬聯譯</p>
<p>依照聯合國大會在倫敦會議中通過的決議案，經濟曁社會理事會便在二月問設置小組委員會，就復興所必要的國際機構，擬具建議，該小組的報吿書表明復興需要，非常龐大。去年秋季，大會在紐約會議，檢討此項報吿書，和建議，一九四七年三月廿七日，經社理事會，設置歐洲及亞洲遠東兩個經濟委員會，這兩個分區團體，具有廣大權力，可調查復興問題，並作有關區域內各國政府的諾詢。歐洲經委會五月間在日內瓦開始工作，亞洲遠東經美會六月十六日在上海舉行第一屆會議。</p>
<p>被侵佔各國獲得解放後，聯合國善後救濟總署立刻應付戰災國家善後救濟的需求，這國際機關已定於一九四七年停止在，所以聯合國亟需決定對於還需救濟的國家，如何繼續予以救濟。大會去秋討論這問題，議定救濟的需要已成尾聲，問題雖然迫切，祗是短期而已，所以大會並不設置新的國際機關，以辦理救濟事宜，但決議各國間應互相治商，取得救濟。未幾，有一委員會成立，以斷定需要救濟各國的需求，和各該國自行應付此種需求的能力。過去五個月來，秘書長己佈置非正式的諮謁，帮助各國避免其救濟計劃的重複，同時，又將需要救濟的地點和種類，通知捐助救濟品各國，五月廿三日秘書長請各會員國政府供給更多有關救濟需要和計劃的情報。</p>
<p>戰後時期，因全世界糧食匱乏，遭受丘議各國的痛苦益深。直到現在，糧食危局依然存在，大會在倫敎會議時，曾促請各國政府，用嚴格辦法，協助保存糧食，和增加糧產。去秋大會在紐約再度研究糧食情形，並提出各國政府應予採納的詳細建議，藉以减少糧荒，而使糧食得以運入需糧最迫切之區。</p>
<p>歐洲方面至少有三千萬兒童，鶉衣百結，饑饉垂斃，而遠東方面，處境相同的兒童，也有這麼許多或許更多，他們需要糧食，房屋，衣着和藥物，大會去秋議決設置國際兒童急賑基金，予以援助，這墓金由各政府，組織和個人自動捐輸，現已進行工作，不久便可源源給予糧食和福利的援助。</p>
<p>此外聯合國並已擬定計劃，將向全世界呼籲。</p>
<p>以應付兒童，少年和產婦的緊迫需要，此種呼籲，將加惠於國際兒童急賑基金和其他組織。</p>
<p>大會在去秋十二月又決議接辦聯總諮詢社質的社會福利活動、其中包括兒童福利，訓練社會福利工作人員，恢復社會福利組織和團體，賬濟殘疾，和調整各志願機關的活動。</p>
<p>聯合國管理領土</p>
<p>舊金山會議，雖然有人類百分之八十以上的代表出席，但是擬定憲章時，還有數千萬人民的呼聲，未曾直接聽到，這些都是生活在非自治領土內的人民。然而，他們的利益，絕對未遭忽親，而管理此等領土的大國，已自行率先訂定憲章的條規，規定這些人民的政治，經濟和社會進步以及向自治或獨立進展。一個主要機關，即託管理事會，已經成立，管理或監督交託給聯合國的領土。</p>
<p>但是，要待非自治領土自動交出，依照新的國際託管制度辦理，否則，託管理事會不能開始工作，管理非自治領土各大國，必須提出託管協定，規定管理非自治地區的條件，然後這協定須經大會通過，如果是戰略地區，則協定須經安全理事會通過。最後託管理事會須待大會選定其理事國，才能開始工作，。理事國名額，管理和非管理託管領土的國家各半。</p>
<p>大會在倫敦集議中，曾號召各國履行憲章在此方面的規定。一九四六年秋，大會在紐約集議，將會員國代表以前國際聯盟八個委任統治國提出的協定章案，提出討論，這草案經澈底審議，終獲通過，結果將坦干宜下，英領卡美隆，英領托哥蘭，處安達，烏隆第，法領卡美隆，法領托哥蘭，新幾內亞，和西薩賡亞，均交在國際託管制度下。大會又爲託管理事會加選兩個理事國，使管理與非管理託管領土的理事國名額相等。目前，託管理事會的理事國，爲澳大利亞，比利時，中國，法國，伊朗，墨西哥，紐西蘭，英國，蘇聯，及美國，此重要機關在一九四七年三月與四月間召開第一屆會議。</p>
<p>託管理事會的工作如何？第一屆會的紀錄，同然有大部份是組織事項，但實際上已可表現託管理事會的各種主要活動。第一點，託管理事會擬就詳細的臨時徵詢書”內載問題二百四十七項，涉及託管領土的各方面活動，這徵詢書是一種表格，由管理非自治領土的國家，照此表格，就其管理領土內居民的進步情形，按年擬具報吿，提交大會審議，俾五十五個會員國都能由瞭管理國如何實行憲章條規。</p>
<p>第二點，</p>
<p>託管理事會審</p>
<p>來自坦干宜卡的請願書數十伴，請願書是現在或以前僑居該託管領土的德義僑民所發出，請求託管理事會對於他們被遺送回原籍國事，加以干與。接受並審議這些請願書，乃是託管理事會生要職務之一，託管理事會詳細審議請願書所提出的問題後，便一般的贊同英國政府將不良僑民遺回本國的政策。</p>
<p>亞羣島居民領袖也提出請　書，要求准許薛　亞自治，並終止薩摩亞羣島「不自然的劃分」爲美國管理及紐西蘭託管。託管理事會經一致議決，派調查團前赴實地關查。七月三日即託管理事會召開首屆會議以後，三星期，三人調查團即首途往　摩亞，研究聯合國應採取何種措施，以滿足該地人民的願望。</p>
<p>與託管有關的</p>
<p>另一件重要事件</p>
<p>是處置前交日本委任統治的馬紹爾，卡羅來恩與馬利亞納四羣島問題。太平洋戰爭期間，這四個羣島極關重要，一九四七年二月十七日，美國政府提出這四個羣島的託管協定草案，指定各該羣島爲戰略區域’交美國管理，協定草案經辦理戰略區域託管事宜的安全理事會加以討論，四月二日，安理會一致通過這協定，現正等待華國政府批准，一俟批准之後，依照協定條件，美國管理這戰略區域，將照國際託管制度辦理。</p>
<p>憲章中關於託管制的條規，適用於八個託管領土的一千四百萬人民，其未經交給聯合國保護的非自治領土，尚有數千百萬的人民，又將如何？憲章對於這些人民的利益，也有規定，則負責管理此等領土的會員國，應將谷該地區的經濟，社命及敎育情形，經常報告秘書長。</p>
<p>聯合國的原來會員國，共有五十一國，一九四六年大會第一屆會第二期會議，准許阿富汗，冰島，暹羅，及瑞典四個新會員國入會，總數增至五十五國。去年十一月，大會向安理會建議，重新審議阿爾巴尼亞，愛爾蘭，外蒙古，葡萄牙及外約坦要求入會申請書，嗣後匈牙利與義大利亦由請加入，安理會的新會員國入會審查委員會，對於各該申請將加審查。目前安理會與大會各個委員會正在會同擬　新會員國申請入會手續的新規則。</p>
<p>難民與貿易問題</p>
<p>第二次大戰所造成的難民與流徙民衆，尚有將近一　百萬之數，至今還住在德境，及歐洲其他地點的難民營中，一九四六年一月，大會召開最初幾次會議時，便已注意這問題的嚴重性，在聯合國善後救濟總署以及政府問難民委員會終止工作之前，此種戰時難民，不能不有妥適的安頓方法。（待續）</p>

<p>〔傅况　律師答〕典權人因出典人　滿典期經過二年，不以原典價回贖即取得典物所有種，完成此項手續。（一）須將原典契與出典人附執之權狀，送請地政局爲過戶取得所有權之登記，並完完納契稅。（二）向法院爲不動產取得所有種之登記母須經過訴訟程序。</p>
<p>（二）脅迫遷讓</p>
<p>蒯以信問　鄙人所住之古屋二閒，世居達二十年以上。最近該屋易主發生房屋糾紛，請問（一）屋主以三月不收租金爲藉口擬收回房屋，房客是否可向屋主提出訂立租約，要求立‘繼續居住（當年並無租約）！（二）當年因無租約，而屋主令房客遷讓，如拒絕遷讓是否犯法？（三）屋主如使用惡勢力脅迫遷讓應如何對付！（四）屋主迫令房客遷讓，無非思增强收入，如屋主擬增收小費應如何對付？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）不必提出立租約，可　　　。因租賃未以字據訂立者，視爲不定期限之租賃，至屋主不收租金，則應依法提存。（二）祇須租賃合法，即不觸犯法律。（三）應依法訴請救濟，屋主不能以惡勢迫遷。（四）如屋主因修理房屋，需要承租人貼償芳午，倘數額不大，在目今環境情况之下，宜稍予之，藉資息事寗人。</p>

<h3>擱樓隨筆</h3>
<p>— 梅林</p>
<p>他是科長，一個頗具交際事務才幹的人；所以他穿戴很講究，套頭西服，紋皮鞋，五十一型金筆，自動游泳夜光　，鑽石戒指，宛如外交官。他說話五句，三句哈哈；吃了飯，用手掌掩住嘴唇剔牙齒，氣派完是上流的。但他有一種惡習，慣愛將鼻管裏的濃痰倒喀從嘴裏吐出來。這是衛生家認為最可怕的，比含痰不吐聽人說話更膩人的。我向他指出這種可以使他的女朋友掉頭而去的惡習，他就朋然笑起來，說道：</p>
<p>「這是很平常的。很多大人物都道樣吐法的。』於是帶着哈哈聲說起笑話：「女人決不會因你濃痰倒喀從嘴裏吐出來掉頭而去，就是你滿身狐臭或有其他惡氣味都不打緊。只要你氣魄大，穿着豪華。比如你身穿幾百萬元的套頭西服，你就彎下嘴唇傲慢得兇，女人們也會向你丟過來媚眼的。你老兄只注意小節目，不講大塲面。哈，哈，哈。」</p>
<p>這許是他的經騐談，不純粹是笑話的。我不必驚訝，我所詫異的是他對於「吐痰法」的解說和補充。</p>
<p>「其實吐痰是隨各人的習慣而定。用手帕掩住嘴鼻哼喀，固然甚妙，但一想到袋子裏有些滑膩膩的痰涕，却實在不舒服。用手指揑鼻子甩呢？鄕下土老兒式的，難看得很。只有連痰帶涕一齊從嘴裏吐出來最簡便。很多人採取這種「吐痰法」不是偶然的，大有道理的，哈，哈，哈。』</p>
<p>我只好睜大眼睛看定他的自得的臉孔，不得不驚嘆了。</p>
<p>他講了吐痰法，講「跟的哲學」。據他說人類歷史是一部「跟」的歷史，嘍羅跟大將，大將跟皇帝；於是成功失敗，此興彼衰，演着「史劇」。所謂學問，只要適用於「跟」纔有用，否則去它的。他說，他之所以能穿幾百萬元的套頭西服，是「跟」出來的。他將一直「跟」到有汽車洋房姨太太云。</p>
<p>我跌入沉思裏了，我好像看到一個「大人物」將成長。</p>
<p>在黃家邨，黃姓人聚族而居。他們在居着祖宗遺留下來的房屋。他們爭奪着與損害着各個房屋僅有的那些屬於公衆的天井。</p>
<p>於是，就發生了這樣的事情：</p>
<p>黃大娘洗了臉把臉水向天井裏一潑，汚穢的泥漿隨即四處飛濺，許多飛濺到貢三嬸的鷄籠上</p>
<p>黃三嬸馬上靑了臉，駡道：</p>
<p>『瞎眼嗎？把臉水亂潑！』</p>
<p>黃大娘不能受，回聲駡：</p>
<p>『我偏要潑，天井是公衆的，干你媽事！』</p>
<p>於是就對駡，駡到白熱化，黃三叔耐不住怒火，就來帮駡，而黃大哥自然不能讓老婆一張嘴去獨戰。</p>
<p>『你媽的臭東西！駡多幾句，打斷你的狗腿！』</p>
<p>王大哥瞪着黃牛樣的大眼睛’狠聲替老婆回答；</p>
<p>『牛牯！就要殺的；有本事，我們來！』</p>
<p>黃三叔眞的找了一根鋤頭，直　黃大哥；黃大哥便也順手抓住一條扁擔。於是，雙方對舞着，戰爭起來了。</p>
<p>『又打起來了！何苦呢？唉！』</p>
<p>隔屋的黃叔公走過來排解。他老人家一腦袋的「中和性」，一肚子的「和平」；可是他的家裹，也因了公衆天井的事，分灶了的弟侄輩，也常常跟他吵架。</p>
<p>戰爭是停止了，可是暗鬥却激烈增加，天井裏的汚　泥水天天加多。大家都抱着這個宗旨：</p>
<p>——你們鷄籠放在天井裏去　屎，我的鷄籠也可以；你把聯東西丟到天井裏去，難這我就不會照樣做麼？哼！天井是公衆的</p>
<p>於是，這個天井變成了臭坑，蒼蠅，傳染病菌在那裏繁殖，汚穢泥水在六月天的炎陽曝晒下，蒸發出一種比阿母尼亞更具的氣味。</p>
<p>黃大娘的寳寳阿福，忽然病起來，不想吃，不想喝，老是發熱，說藝語。黃大娘急得呌菩薩，黃三嬸却在暗中：</p>
<p>『好哇！該死的！』</p>
<p>可是當黃大娘的寳寳阿福快死的時候，黃三嬸的心肝貴才也病了，也是發熱，說寫醫，正和阿顧的病症相間。</p>
<p>黃三嬸再不會幸災棄　，心　也急得　薔　。同時全村的人們，無論老少，相纖息了這楓病？這眞是「天災」！</p>
<p>黃叔公有經騐，忙去找和他年紀相上下的老頭兒們，　氣皺　商　之後，決定遵古法「　災」。</p>
<p>在黃曆審上找了一個黃道吉日，放牛坪搭起福壇，從三聖宮抬來一尊菩藝，把來供奉在福壇裏，有幾個光頭和尙，披着法衣，敲着木魚，在那裏唸經。</p>
<p>香烟繚　，紙灰亂飛，菩　嚴然端坐，但閉上眼睛。前去破頭的黃氏子孫絡繹不絕，似乎都很虔誠。</p>
<p>黃三伶叔失婦倆，從福　穢頭回來，心裏念着他們的心肝貴才的病不知會不會好。路上黃三嬸看見墻壁上新貼着許多黃紙寫黑字的大紙條，忙問她的老公是什麼意思，黃三叔就虔誠的唸道：</p>
<p>同族們吃素起來！</p>
<p>誠心誠意到福壇確頭去！</p>
<p>擁護菩薩肅淸瘟疫！</p>
<p>菩蕯萬歲！</p>
<h3>北戴河之夏</h3>
<p>— 逸峯</p>
<p>去夏，是我一生中最悠閒的一個夏天；榴花剛在枝頭吐紅時，我閩家就去北戴河避暑，也可說是避難罷！在大薄荷寨租了三間平房，取其離海不遠而得鄉居靜趣，長夏無事，有的是閒暇，有的是自由，有的是　家同遊的機　，我能忘記這一夏脾腉嗎？</p>
<p>淸晨，後院一株疏疏朗朗的桃枝中，透進了一窗晨　，滿園子的蕃茄玉蜀黍和向日葵，潤着朝露，一生靑葱，我忙着灌水除草，替這圍子梳洗了一會，就帶着兒女們，順着原野的大道，走上起起伏伏的山徑，一路擷野花，夏菊，野藝，山杜鵑，石水仙，以及其他不知名的山花，插滿了每個小見女的頭上和襟上，山下風次麥浪，如同少女柔髮似的纔出有風情的波紋，遠處，山海關那邊雄偉的山峯，據着天險，像屏陣般的排列着，隱現在雲霧中，有時還　約地看出游龍般的萬里長城，似乎它在于誇耀着史蹟上的偉大和光榮，近望東西兩山，　蕯積間，擁護着各種式樣各種色調的別墅，有別墅裏透出淸薩，有淸薩裏透出別　，好像靑枝綠葉閒，開滿了鮮葩，又好像一張綠絲絨地　上織上了無數花採。</p>
<p>下山一出劉莊，就海濱了，天風海濤，正　着有節奏而宏大的音樂，樂得羣兒手舞足蹈的齊聲呌起來了！「呀！偉大的海啊！」他們年幼的，坐在沙灘上拾弄貝殼，拿細沙堆成金字塔，年紀稍大一些的，奔入海中，和浪花追逐爲戲，我則裸臥沙灘上，和海天默默相對，仰看幾片白雲，自由舒卷，忽聞羣兒在海中頻須招手喚余入海，就同他們投入了海的懷抱裏，洗凈了身心的　垢，輕淸鬆爽，　撇欲仙，淸山綠水，對人們原是一親同仁的，不過這班役役於名利場中的，縱情於冷氣設備中的，只怪自己　遠了自然，遺忘了自然，這亂淸視，就好像變成無樣享受了！</p>
<p>四時中，春只予人們陶醉的誘惑，秋暗示人們頹喪的傷感，冬專予窮人嚴厲的　脅，只有夏，它用光和熱來鼓勵人們，還肯多給予窮人一些接獨大自然的　會，我們想感謝夏的慷慨，我們就該接受夏的賜予！</p>
<p>斜陽西下，署氣全消，諸兒連我，都還留戀不願回去，直到滿天星斗，才望着。</p>
<p>稀疏零落的村火，和牧童漁父，同上歸途。</p>
<p>陸放翁詩云：『偶呼快馬迎新月，卻上輕輿御晚風，』這是放翁做官時的風趣，我雖無快馬可騎，輕與可坐，但是一手　着濕透的浴衣，一手提着雙履，赤膨踏在斯斯沙沙的海邊沙灘上，浪花時時在足脛上沖洗着，却也別具風趣呢！</p>
<p>赤脚半裸，在北戴河是很普偏的，女子穿一身浴衣，儘可在大街上自由自在的走着玩着，大家一樣地共享着原野的自然生活</p>
<p>北戴河是北國的夏令姑娘，但是她具有西方美人的風韻，江南　閣的秀姿；可是一別經年的她，現在正　息在砲火的周團裏，我怎能不關懷她的平安呢？</p>
<h3>花樹</h3>
<p>— 青果</p>
<p>楊槐</p>
<p>一條長長的兩旁生長着楊槐的公路，看起來，是够美麗的。</p>
<p>遠遠望去，就像兩道綠牆夾成了一個甬道。那轉彎的地方好像隱藏着無窮盡的幽靜與神秘，一種悠遠的感覺會搔癢你的心。走在那裏，你會忘記你的疲倦，你會失去你的計算里程和停下脚步的知能，間直跟追求一個希望一樣，只是向前邁進。</p>
<p>幾次，我在想，假使楊槐樹下有一個穿着綠紗的女郞，我們的煽著熱情的歌聲，燃燒着愛的眼光流過枝葉，熔在一起。……</p>
<p>幾次，我在想，假使楊槐樹下有一隻發射着紅光的燈籠，從黝黑的夜浪里，隨　放浪的笑聲和輕淡的足音，慢慢地泅去。……</p>
<p>老實說，我太喜歡楊槐樹了。</p>
<p>在楊槐樹下做個綠色的夢不曉得要遼闊到什麼地方啊。</p>
<p>如今楊槐的花又開了，公路上流動着醉人的芬香。</p>
<p>我散着步：踏着落花，踏着香氛；我在想一個人，一個故事</p>
<p>但願我有眞的緣色的夢吧，而且是開遍了楊槐花的。</p>
<p>玫瑰</p>
<p>窗外，是一塊小小的園地。</p>
<p>當黎明搔落壓在我眼臉上的夢影時，一股淸淡的芳香便輕輕地抹上我的面龐。</p>
<p>我知道，從夜那邊爬過來的玫瑰花又開了。</p>
<p>玫魂在窗口下，打開窗，第一個躍進視野的就是牠。牠會拴着我的視綫，讓那已開的花和未開的　一呆呆地都在視綫上打個結後，才放開去看那構織成綠帳似的樹和草。</p>
<p>在桌子上，我安着一隻小得可憐的插着玫瑰在的瓶子。每天，我股動地換水，殷動地換花；換過的水，就潑在窗下的玫塊樹底，換過的印，也扔在窗下的玫塊樹底。</p>
<p>有時，我也有些傷感‘死去的花朶不也有不能遺忘的過去嗎？然而，新生的花朶却在裝飾着一個美麗的未來。</p>
<p>一天，幾個孩子跑進我的寢室，搶去了插在瓶中的玫瑰花，僅僅留下「朶快要枯謝的給我。</p>
<p>但她們都笑嘻嘻地，每一張小嘴含着一朶玫瑰花，對我說：</p>
<p>「這是我們的。』</p>
<p>就在我準備上前去爭奪時，她們全把花呑食了。</p>
<p>於是，玫瑰花在她們的臉上嘴上開了，開得那麼地鮮麗，燦爛。</p>
<h3>香溪范浚詩</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>香溪范浚文，嶄絕矯健，鑿鑿明整，卓然成家，所爲詩則鹿鹿無新意。惟聽琴一章云：「坐人皆聽琴，未必知琴音，相知紛滿眼，未必相知心，知音如子期，知心如鮑叔，此道久寥寥，雄其踵高躅？古聲勿復彈，古心徒自憐；知音惟月露，知我其惟天。君不見，只今人情簿如紙，只今世路如溪惡，咄嗟許事不足論，鳥跡微茫度寥廓。」獨寄深慨焉。</p>
<h3>詩語錄</h3>
<p>— 葦詠</p>
<p>詩是帶有情感色彩的管聲。</p>
<p>所謂詩就是一種用字的屆術—也靠是用字使心象上　生出　　一糧幻像的藝術。</p>
<p>詩是　　性的字。</p>
<p>是思想的音藥，而由　實的音　　給我織‘</p>
<p>詩是　業至上的心靈在至上至　時的記載</p>
<p>詩是那深奧的，眞憾的眞理之言辭。</p>
<p>作詩是挑選最好的果　。</p>
<p>詩，是情感在平復時候的追憶。</p>
<p>詩的產生，文字的表現佔十分之一，其餘十分之九是你生活反應的方。　　詩是情感的共鳴。</p>
<h3>少年鬥牛士</h3>
<p>— 馬奈</p>
<p>馬奈（Eduar　Manet　1812-1883）是印象主義的先驅者。幼時從師庫裘（T.Couture）學　，因不滿其師之呆板作風，遂自覓途徑，從事研究印象手法。一八六三年以一草地之野餐」出品沙龍，不幸落選。於是邀約作風相近之落選青年作家，聯合舉行「落選畫展覽會」，雖受盡當時一般士之嘲笑，但他們不顧一切的建立了新繪畫理論。</p>
<p>其作風之特點爲追求外光，捕捉一煞間的事物的印象。所胃「印象主義」之名，也就因此而得。代表有「奧令比亞」，一草地野餐」等。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　349</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我略一盤算使問鼎元：「您跟耀君小姐沒有約會再見面的地點，方式？」我決定也上雙義橋去了。</p>
<p>「她說過，她來找我，可又沒指定時間。我的地點她已經記下去了…就是傍晚孫隊長碰見我的那個地方…」鼎元說到這裏，瞧了瞧呆在一旁的僅大個子，露出一絲笑意。</p>
<p>「你怎麼碰見了吳先生？」我瞧着「〇四」。</p>
<p>「回秘書長話，我沒碰見吳先生……是吳先生碰見我，趕着呌我孫隊長；我嚇了一跳目目來也不認識什麼和尙。後來吳先生說，「我就是長辛店的吳鼎元工程師，現在出家做和尙哪！」這，我才仔細看出來，可不眞是吳工程師？……手手槍也還給我哪。」</p>
<p>我剛想告訴鼎元和大傻子，預備這就動身上雙義橋去，探詢耀羣的踪跡，忽然又有電訊來了。這是「〇十二」從東京發來的：</p>
<p>「證實·KCC二日內準達平，請速準備各高級職員會同語見；緊急。」</p>
<p>這「證實」二字，指着剛才那件秘電內容而說；KCC就是鶴見的代用名字。剛才那封電訊，是報吿鶴見在東京這兩天的經過，情形危險而複雜；因他趁着「受訓」的特殊情形，再度佈置搜索「七封秘誠，」這個舉動，幾乎被德人第五縱隊和松組幹部的聯合陣綫窺破。可是到底被鶴見和萍子的一羣，探到另一新路綫；現在正準備自己全部人馬和w君部下聯合，到灌陽大舉工作，何種工作，並未說明，僅說「續展露」，又說KCC擬在二三日內飛平，正在佈置「路綫」。</p>
<p>據我擋測，這「工作」似與「秘緘」無關，也許指着跟松部正式破臉作戰而說，否則何以要到瀋陽，何以要招集全部人馬和W君部下聯合？但又無法向「〇十二」探聽「工作」二字的涵義：我以交換秘訊的習慣，凡有一個問題，暫時未曾全部明瞭，或這僩問題，還未到可能發表的時候，總是用「續展露」三個字來表示，呌對方不必追問，問亦無益。</p>
<p>我把這兩件電訊內容立即轉達北平w君總部，也簡略吿訴了鼎元和「〇四」，又命「〇四」預備草子；反正鼎元當晚必須回到他的「住留處」，我們正好送他回去，然後再去探詢　羣踪跡。我認爲目前沒有比這還重要的問題。又呌「〇四」關照劉五，呌他注意淸晨四點鐘收報的事。</p>
<p>可是我這計劃，竟遭鼎元和，「〇四」的反對。他們認爲這時已經夜已過半，我是臨時代理總隊長，應當坐鎭電台，同時也應當略事休息。另外一條理由，我個人的動作，比較容易遭人注意　設若已經有人注意的話！還以靜守爲妙。况且，凡我要去的所在，「〇四」也能去，我要探聽的事，「〇四」也能代理；路綫比我還要熟習，因有日間的經騐。最後一條理由，劉五雖說能够收報，只限於機械工作；萬一碰到即須解決的間題，他就辦不下去。</p>
<h3>物價跌！</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>物價普逼下談，這是近幾月來　有的事。</p>
<p>這有如萬熱度中央然括來一陣狂風暴雨。</p>
<p>這狂風暴雨，說明了曉幾事情：（二）美國旅來的特使魏　　，臘已由美起程，他之來，瞪明美萬積極援華，中國經濟情况，將轉換八新階段。（二）中日貿易即將恢復，日本貨即刻來了，日本戰時工業並未損毀，威本要比中國經得多；（三）這兩天銀根緊俏，商行爲吸收現款，不得不拋出貨物。</p>
<p>於是你看：米幾乎退進四十萬大關；人造絲猛瀉；華股跌停版；紗布，食油，都在下瀉，甚至黑市金鈔，都不得不望風却步。</p>
<p>物價跌，在小市民說，總是好現象，但對工商業，却是一信嚴重的信號！這些時候，因爲物　漲，工商業的籌碼，統統放在「投　」的賠台上，因爲那可以使他們鐵更　厚的拆息，一轉手，馬上可以吃進幾萬萬，幾千萬，但是這些投機市塲基本的因素，根本消失的時候，即中國經濟情形如若眞正轉換入一個穩定的階段，金鈔黑市已不成爲黑市，紗布人造絲因日本貨傾銷而暴跌，那時候，請問熱中於「投機」事業的工商鉅子，你將怎麼辦？</p>
<p>這不是一個美的預言，中日貿易馬上即將實施，魏德邁來中國不久即可帶來經濟的援助，我們工商業鉅子，你且看看人家怎樣在恢復生產事業吧，現在，已經不是再呆在「投機」賭台上，翻雲覆雨的時候了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>美·蘇·朝鮮</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>日本投降，美蘇根據波次坦協定，占領朝鮮，美南蘇北，各行其是，政治經濟文化，隨着各自主張發展。</p>
<p>大概兩方覺悟這種做法不對，於是同意組織美蘇聯合委員會，想把南北朝鮮合而爲一，成立朝鮮臨時政府，前月談判進行頗爲順利，但今日報載美方勃郞將軍發表譴責蘇聯使用否決權，造成停頓狀態，朝鮮臨時政府的成立說不定要流產。</p>
<p>一八八四年（光緒十年）朝鮮親日派金王均之亂，成立親日派內閣，經袁世凱討平，日本派兵至朝鮮，於一八八五年（光緒十一年）一月迫朝鮮訂立京城條約，同年四月十八日，伊藤博文與李鴻章訂立天津條約，撤退中日兩國朝鮮駐軍。一八九四年（光緒二十年）朝鮮東學黨之亂，兩國派兵平定，造成中日戰爭。一八九五年（光緒二十一年）中日訂立馬關條約，朝鮮名爲獨立，交際轉爲日本獨有，同年俄連德法干涉歸還東半島，中國退塲，俄國正式登台，中日朝鮮角逐，變爲日俄滿洲競爭。</p>
<p>一九〇四年（光緒三十年）日俄戰爭開始，俄國敗北，一九〇五年（光緒三十一年）日俄訂立樸資茅斯條約，俄國將得自中國的南滿權益，全部讓於日本。迨第一次世界大戰結束，俄國革命，日本躍爲五强之一。九一八滿洲事變，日人造成偽「滿洲國」，俄國在滿洲勢力完全逐出，日本獨覇朝鮮滿洲，前年二次世界大戰結束，蘇聯在滿洲，鮮朝，恢復其帝俄勢力而有餘，朝鮮更變爲美蘇占領的角逐地。</p>
<p>六十年前爭奪朝鮮的主角爲中日兩國，六十年後的今日，爭奪朝鮮的主角雖不能說是美蘇，但美蘇兩國主義不同，佔領施政方針不一，長久發展下去，界限越分越淸。魏德邁將軍不日前來視察中韓，看了朝鮮今日形態，看了中國東北情勢，來日作成報吿，不知白富主人作何處置？</p>
<p>我們爲美鮮着想，我們爲朝鮮着想，希望美蘇談判的朝鮮政府馬上成立，美蘇退出朝鮮；同時希望蘇聯遵守中蘇條約，朝鮮滿洲的情勢方能澄淸明朋，美蘇方不會導演過去中日及日俄的巴戲。</p>
<h3>性善與性惡</h3>
<p>— 拙生</p>
<p>世間不可思議的事情很多，世間非獨有偶的事情也很多。前者是玄學鬼魂的顯現，後者是科學精神的表徵。</p>
<p>戰國時代，中國的孟子與荀子，各守一個堅固的堡壘，互相撑拒，互相攻擊，孟子的堡壘是性善，荀子的堡　是性惡，難分勝負，以迄於今，雖然他們人都死了，兩座堡壘仍然爲衣鉢相傳的徒兒們看守着。</p>
<p>十六世紀的法蘭西，也有一模一樣的事情發生。刺柏　（Framcois　Rcbolats）和喀爾文（John　Calvin）都是當時學術界的代表。刺柏雷說：人性是善的。喀爾文說：人性是惡的。他的性惡論，有一種無比的强調和銳利的理論，兩個人可說是在文藝復興時代關於靈魂的有力論爭者：刺柏雷以上帝爲慈悲的宇宙管理人，喀爾文則以上帝爲鐵面無私的栽判官。</p>
<p>時期雖一先一後，從歷史方面研究，可以知道刺柏當喀爾文絲毫沒有受到荀子言論的影響，完全是發之自我，這種學術上的「萬里因緣無綫牽」，「天作之合」，也正是不可思議的事情。</p>
<p>刺柏雷的價値，今日非常的動搖；喀爾文即仍被尊爲具有最高理想的一個偉大人物。孟老夫子造化好，東方究竟不同於西方，中國究竟不同於法國。</p>
<h3>惜分飛</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>

<h3>北塔山事件</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>曁地理民族的因素</p>
<p>北塔山在新疆的東北，靠近蒙古的西面是丘陵山脈，地勢在一千公尺左右；這地區人烟稀少，而有數百里的肥沃草原，屬於準萬爾盆地，而盆地所處緯度極高，加以離海極遠，故寒暑之差極烈，雨量稀少，成一乾燥區地，因此畜牧就代替了農業；但農業並不是不發達。以住民漢族較多，不慣畜牧，祗好業農，是該地爲北廳最大產糧區。物產除畜牧農業外，還有金，石油，鈾等礦產。塔山的東部有一大塊沙漢，稱曰古爾班通古特沙漠，此沙漢因光綫易起曲折，故常有視差發生，夜間每覺星光燦爛，白天見遠處山林如在目前，故有「望山跑死馬，取物蒼茫問一」之諺。因爲外蒙奧新優接壤的地帶相當之長，中間僅有阿　泰山相蘭；阿爾泰山從西北到東南，從扎　克而至天山北絡的準　爾部，平沙彌望，沒有高山大川可守，而隻方居住這一地帶的，全是遊牧民族。這是北塔山事件發生的地理因素。</p>
<p>北塔山離新疆省會——迪化，祇有九百華里。如果北塔山不守，敵騎會南行三百里，進佔哈密與迪化之間的奇臺縣，切斷了新省到蘭州的唯一通道。新省的國際交通，西從伊寗到蘇聯，兩由和　到印度的國際路綫久已不通；唯一通往國內的大道，由蘭州酒泉至里星峽到哈密，鎭西經奇台到迪化，全長約四千里。奇台就是這條大道的貿易樞紐，同時又是全省的商業中心，更重要的是軍事的重鎭。</p>
<p>蘇聯中亞重工業心臓U·K·K·區的南端喀喇干達，距新疆的塔城，僅五百航空哩，其庫茲潯克盆地的龐大鋼鐵煤工業區斯塔林斯克，距阿爾泰的承化寺僅四百航空哩。</p>
<p>橫貫新疆的天山，把新省分爲南北兩部；北部尖端突出部份是上面所述的阿爾泰山區，是哈薩克人同蒙古遊牧人民集居之所，是旣往新省變亂的大本營，更是外人覬鐵的地方；十幾年來的新疆事變，無一次不起於阿山。阿山是新疆東北部第五行政區，區治初設於承化，阿山區面積達閣，礦產　宮，人口六三·〇四〇人，哈薩克族佔五三·三五二人，約佔百分之七十五强。其他有漢族，維吾爾族，回回族，克爾募斯族，和蒙古人，哈族和維族是伊寗事變的主角，這是因爲他們的人口比較眾多，與仇視漢人的緣故。這些人懷着渴念祖國的熟情，但又懷着失望已久的心緒，不能不投向　國的懷抱；他們取得了蘇聯的國籍，成爲具着、兩軍國籍的人，這是多麼悲痛的呵！哈蘇克族原名爲土耳其斯坦，過去所謂「東土耳其斯坦共和國」，亦就是維吾爾族和哈薩克族所策動，因此釀成「伊寗事變」。到了現在「東土耳其斯坦」政府的旗職到處都可以看見。是的，「東土耳其斯坦」時代的現象，不但仍存在於伊寗，塔城，阿爾泰山三區，而且已遷移到迪化來了。此外的蒙古人，亦是値得注意的；因爲蒙古民族曾有一個相當畏的時期統治悲新疆，現遺留在新疆雀內的還有十五萬人，散布在焉耆區，塔城區，伊犂區，阿山區，烏蘇區等地，其人數較他族爲少，所以或者難免會和其他民族發生衝突。</p>
<p>新張的民族是非常複雜的，而阿爾泰山區峧他區更甚。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐寂團</p>
<p>跳舞教育在美國</p>
<p>廣義的敎育，不限讀死書，死讀書書及讀書死，而是包羅萬象，無所不有的。所以美國式敎育中，有性敎育談座，有原子能談座，有跳舞訓練，除各大學均有跳舞一門踝程，專敎舞台表演舞外，另有許多跳舞專科學校，這種學校規模都相當宏大。我在曉市頓時，參觀過一家阿彼斯跳舞學校Abe's　Dancing　School，設在樓上，下面是商店，由側門走上樓梯，直達校長辦公室，由校長室通舞池及化粧室，舞池極大，比上海的職業無塲的舞池還要大些，而這家跳舞學校，並不是曉市頓最大的一個，舞池的四週裝有大型玻璃鏡，俾初學者可以看到自己的姿勢，容納得下四五十對人跳舞，學費分兩種，單學每半小時二元，每次付或一期付淸均可，跳一次算一次，但約定時間不去也得算一次，團體學習每次　一元，每星期舉行二次團體舞，實際等於開一次跳舞會，主任敎師是校長和他的太太，而以高材生担任助敎，均係十七八歲的高中女生，不但是循循善誘，而且是體貼入微，三樓有一班專敎舞台表演舞及俄羅斯舞，學生都把外衣脫云，祗留三角袴及奶罩，沿窗有一長約二丈餘之把手，初學者一手握住把，始可練習抬腿而不搖搖欲墜，　胸粉腿，絕妙電影鎮頭。此極對於各種舞藝，保證成功，敎授極爲嚴格，學舞台表演舞者，每日至少勤練二小時，非跳到香汗涔涔嬌喘吁吁不止。美國人以跳舞為健身妙諦，非僅藝術而已也。而美國女子之美，乃在腿部之美，較東方女子爲長而有勁，以得力於跳舞為多，中國女性缺少正當運動，其先天不足者類都多愁善病如林黛玉，某養尊處優者則癡肥碩大如牯牛，我反對以跳舞爲貿利工具，却贊成以跳舞爲建美敎育之一部門。（二三）</p>
<h3>螢窗消夏錄</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>異曲同工</p>
<p>偶讀畏廬瑣記，載劉孝議　一則云：</p>
<p>「劉孝廉，諱其名，自云騫於伉儷，妻病死，劉為詩云：「來世因緣休再誤，此生夢寐倘相逢」。夜則抱其夫人木主同臥起。又別作其夫人小木主，以象牙製小　，懸之襟上，每語必及其夫人。久久人頗厭聞，劉亦怏怏不可自聊。一日友人造訪劉家，以爲劉失偶必獨宿。排　就其床寢，則方與傭婦局衾而寐，木主　床下矣，友人大笑。」</p>
<p>想起來所謂「鄕愿」大概就是這一類人物吧。表面上仁至義盡，像煞一位正人君子，而背地裏却偏有那許多不可吿人之事。記得杭州南屏山　孝子坊的故事，也有異曲同工之妙，錄之如下</p>
<p>「初，孝子喪母，閉門哀痛，每哭羣鳥下集，三年年不减。而鳥集愈衆，鄰里驚爲異孝，縣官爲之請旌，天子賜孝子之坊。全邑詫爲拾古之典。而孝子閉門哀哭如故也。有點者，或不信，他日，孝子哭，薄其門而窺之，則孝子方行於庭中，且哭且撒米，羣鳥聞哭聲而知得食，翔而集中以千，其人因大笑。哭聲爲亂異曰，孝子遷去，而石坊至今如故，錄孝子焉。」</p>
<p>這一　戲，倒是很精采的。這位孝子確有億大的戲劇天才，劉孝廉對之，當自愧弗如的吧。其實，像這種僞君子，又何止劉孝廉等一二人而已，不過，因爲技術更深湛，手段更高明，大家都被瞞了過去，意把他們當做　明一般看待，如有好事者也　從　　裏把他們一下戳穿，那恐怕仇眞　一鏡不值的！</p>
<h3>南極概況</h3>
<p>— 寗敘仁</p>
<p>我們人類所在的世界上，除亞·美·歐·匪及大洋洲五大洲以外，還有一南極洲，我們在地岡上可以看見地球的兩端及東西兩半球，上端爲北極，下端爲南極，南極洲大部在南極圈內，跨有東西兩半球，爲最近所發見，可稱爲最新的大陸。</p>
<p>南極的地方，距人類繁殖的地方，較北極更遠，所以探險的事情，較北極遲數百年，一七七三年科克（Cook）環極周航，越年發見南佐治亞（South　Georgia）得維（Sandwich）諸島，爲南極探險第一人，十九世紀初，繼起者，絡續不絕。一八三九年，英派羅斯（Ross）氏乘其府號船，入南極圈發見羅斯海（Rose　Sea）愛德華七世地（K.　Edward　VII　L.D）及冥府火山，開今日探險的通道，為十九世紀最著者。其後去南極者亦眾，最近航空發達，美柏德少將，爲南極探險之偉大人物，一九二五年，飛抵南極，一九二八年，第二次探險，飛越高三千六百公尺的山峯，經過三千公尺的高原，發見南極有許多山脈，證實南極實係大陸，自此之後，南極始爲人們所注目了。</p>
<p>南極州爲一廣大的冰雪高原，而積有一千四百萬餘方公里，南極州的四周爲南極羊（Sou-thern）所包圍，南極洋與太平。大西，印度三洋相連，並無界綫，其水陸之分布，適與北極相反北極以水而中心，爲北極洋爲歐·亞·美三洲所包圍，而南極以陸地爲中心。南極的晝夜，亦與北極相反，四月至八月，日在地平綫以下，有夜無晝，八月至四月，日在地平綫以上，有畫無夜，南極夏天，北極爲冬天，溫度平均在零度以下，雨量甚少，平均三百公　。</p>
<p>南北兩極有奇異的光彩呌做極光，因爲太陽放射在天空的電帶現象，南極極光形如圓弓，黃紫色的顏色，極燦爛美麗，光度沒有北極强，次數也很少。</p>
<p>南極的植物，沒有北極多，因爲四周大洋的圍繞，與他洲隔開，而汽候亦冷，發見者僅有苔鮮與藻類等，南極地方沒有居民，動物亦少，惟海中有鯨魚，海狗，海　等，鳥類有海燕，海島等，陸上多企鵝，除此之外，並無其他動植物。</p>
<p>南極爲英·美·等國家探險家所發見，關於領土的主權問題，至今還沒有解決，所以到現在各國並不輕易的放素，因爲南極地方有許多良港可成爲漁港成軍港，並且還有許多的當藏，待開發呢。</p>

<h3>Chairman Presides Over State Council Meeting; Revised Outline for Mobilization Approved; Communist Party National Representative and State Council Member Quotas Cancelled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The State Council Committee held its seventh meeting on the morning of the 18th. Chairman Chiang personally presided. Committee members Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, and Xu Chuanlin attended, totaling 20 people.

(See page 2) (3) The resignation of Gu Zhenglun, Executive Yuan Minister of Political Affairs and concurrently Minister of Food, was approved, and Yu Fei was appointed as his successor, which was resolved and approved. (4) The appointment of Xing Senzhou as a member of the Control Yuan was resolved and approved. (5) Many financial budget proposals from various agencies were passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Attends Meeting to Explain the Significance of Mobilization</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The "Outline for Implementing Constitutional Government Upon Completion of the Suppression of Rebellion" was submitted for discussion at the State Council meeting on the 18th. Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan first explained the original proposal, stating: Since receiving the instruction to vigorously implement national mobilization to realize the policy of peaceful nation-building, the Executive Yuan has immediately followed the order to instruct its subordinates, explaining the significance of mobilization, supervising its thorough implementation, and repeatedly studying and formulating the eighteen articles of the implementation outline. The main spirit is to strengthen the mobilization of manpower and material resources to quickly suppress the Communist bandits' rebellion, eliminate obstacles to democracy, and continue to strive to refresh local politics, improve people's lives, and effectively protect the basic interests of the people. All soldiers, civilians, officials at all levels, and even friends from all nations should be clearly aware that the government's mobilization to suppress the rebellion is not only a passive strengthening of the military to suppress bandits, but also an active acceleration of national work. Suppressing the rebellion aims to achieve unity, and suppressing the bandits does not affect the implementation of constitutional government. Only by concentrating strength can the Communist bandits be quickly suppressed, peaceful nation-building be achieved, and the goal be reached as soon as possible. After Zhang Qun's report, many committee members expressed their opinions and proposed amendments, especially regarding Article 17, "Except as otherwise provided in this outline, the Executive Yuan may, in accordance with the provisions of the National General Mobilization Law, issue necessary orders at any time in order to achieve the purpose of suppressing the rebellion." Because this implementation outline only pertains to certain parts and not the whole, there are many matters outside of what is specified in this outline, making it impossible to issue orders at any time. Another opinion was that this part of the outline is based on the General Mobilization Law, and it is not necessary to repeat the General Mobilization Law in this clause. After much discussion, Chairman Chiang stood up and said: This article can be explained, that is, if the Premier of the Executive Yuan needs to issue orders, it must be approved by the State Council meeting or submitted for a report to be approved. If it is not approved, it cannot be implemented. It was then approved by unanimous agreement of all committee members.</p>
<p>Wang Shijie and Bai Chongxi Report on Diplomacy and Military Affairs</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Wang Shijie and Bai Chongxi presented reports on diplomatic and military affairs, respectively, at the State Council meeting on the 18th. The diplomatic part included two points: the peace treaty with Japan and the visit of Special Envoy Wedemeyer to China. Regarding the establishment of the peace treaty with Japan, the drafting of the preliminary draft, and the location and time of the peace conference, Wang said: The United States advocates that eleven countries participate in the peace treaty with Japan, and we should agree and decide to participate. The issue of veto power at the meeting has been decided to adopt a majority rule. Wang also explained Wedemeyer's mission to China. The military report indicated that the Communist army in the Northeast is relatively strong due to international assistance, but its main force has been cut off by the government army. At the same time, many areas have been affected by severe flooding, cutting off many routes, so the current war situation has seen little progress on either side. Secondly, the Communist army in Shandong has the potential to converge towards the Jinpu Railway Line and western Henan, and we are closely guarding against this. After the report, many government committee members raised inquiries, which Wang and Bai answered separately.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The proposal to cancel the reserved quotas for Communist Party National Representatives and State Council members and to remove current Communist Party councilors was reported at the State Council meeting on the 18th. All committee members unanimously agreed that there were no objections. This action is a demonstration of the government's attitude after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Law to strengthen the suppression of the Communist army. According to Article 10 of the National Government Organization Law: "The National Government shall establish a committee limited to 40 members, selected and appointed by the Chairman of the National Government from within and outside the Kuomintang," which does not specify the number of Communist Party members nor does it have explicit provisions for reserving quotas for the Communist Party. There are currently 29 committee members, which is within the limit of 40 and therefore legal. At the same time, the majority believed that this number did not need to be supplemented, as 29 members were sufficient for the statutory number, and some believed that future elections should no longer reserve quotas for the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Mobilization Outline</h3>

<h3>Ningxia Province Has Strong Military Force; Communist Army's Ambitions Will Not Be Fulfilled</h3>
<p>Ma Hongda Talks to Our Reporter</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Ma Hongda, Chairman of Ningxia Province, met with our reporter on the morning of the 18th. Ma said: He came to Nanjing to report on his duties upon the summons of the authorities because Chairman Chiang expressed particular concern about the Communist army's disturbances in the border area of northern Shaanxi. When he met with the Chairman on the 17th, he gave a detailed report on the local situation and is now awaiting instructions. The reporter then inquired about the military strength of Ningxia Province. Ma said that the local people in Ningxia Province have a good foundation in training and are sufficient to defend against the enemy. However, the Communist army's arbitrary disturbances after the victory are a cause for concern. This time, the Peng Dehuai unit of the bandit army fully disturbed the Ningxia border, with the intention of invading Ningxia Province. However, it can be asserted that even with great force, the Communist army cannot achieve its ambition to enter Ningxia because our local military force is well-trained and has a strong united force. As a result of this battle, we have eliminated three and a half regiments of the Communist army's forces, and the Iron Eighth Regiment, which they call their strongest, has also been completely annihilated. Secondly, Ma also talked about economic and educational aspects. Regarding education, there are many primary schools, but only three normal schools in the province. We will try to increase the number in the future. In terms of economy, there are several factories for handicrafts and light industry. Generally speaking, we can be self-sufficient. Ma came to Nanjing in 1936, and this is his first visit after eleven years. He highly praised the construction of the capital.</p>

<h3>Ping'an Soviet Consulate Dismisses Chinese Staff</h3>
<p>And Orders Residents Next to the Consulate to Relocate</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] It is reported that the Soviet Consulate here has dismissed all of its Chinese service personnel and has ordered all Chinese, Americans, and Soviets living in the lane next to the Soviet Consulate to completely evacuate by August 1.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Arrives in Beiping from Shenyang; Generals from Northeast and North China Gather in the Ancient Capital</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, accompanied by Guo Chan and others, flew to Beiping at about 6 p.m. on the 18th. Li Zongren, who was presiding over the meeting of the Xing Yuan, sent Secretary-General Xiao Yishan to welcome him at the airport. After Chen got off the plane, he went to his residence in Taiping Hutong to rest. Li Zongren then visited him. It is reported that Beijing has sent several telegrams to Chen, urging him to return to Beijing before the 20th, while Guo Chan will stay in Ping for a few more days.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Generals are gathering in the ancient capital. Tai Shi-hui arrived in Ping on the same plane as Chen Cheng. Sun Lianzhong is scheduled to fly to Ping on the 19th. After Chen Cheng arrives, he will have important talks with the authorities in North China and Northeast China that evening.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Tianjin, 18th] Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Bao Sui Department, Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, Garrison Commander Lin Weizhu, and Deputy Commander Pang Jiqing took a special train to Ping on the 18th to meet with Chief of Staff Chen. Chen's trip to Tianjin has been canceled.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, came to Ping by train via the Pinggu Line from Chengde on the 18th to meet with Chief of Staff Chen. Also, Lu Zhonglin and others of the Military慰劳团 returned to Ping from Baoding on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] Chen Cheng gave a speech to officers above the rank of colonel stationed in Shenyang at 9 a.m. on the 18th. At 10 a.m., he met with the mother of the volunteer army "Old Lady Zhao" and the responsible persons of the Northeast industry and mining to talk.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng said at a press conference on the morning of the 18th: The people of the Northeast are eager to love the country, and there are young people and the masses, which is the best area for implementing the Three Principles of the People. During my week in the Northeast, I felt that each unit needs to do more self-examination. At present, there is too much forgiveness for oneself and too much criticism of others, forming a phenomenon of resentment against heaven and others. Suppressing bandits is a matter of strengthening the country, and a mobilization order has now been officially issued, which can also be called a punitive expedition order. If the bandits are truly suppressed, it is expected to succeed in three months, but due to international constraints, there may be delays. This is due to our own lack of ambition and effort. There is no distinction between inside and outside the pass, only a distinction between first and last. The interior is focusing on destroying the Communist army. The military center of Shandong and the political center of Shaanxi and Shanxi have turned into a favorable situation. The conscription in the Northeast will be supplemented soon. Everyone is wary of the Communist army's sixth comeback, which is a good phenomenon. Everyone is unwilling to be a slave to a lost country and does not want a third world war, nor do they want to treat the Soviet Union as an enemy. He also said: I originally planned to stay in the Northeast for two weeks, but I was ordered to return urgently. I will fly to Ping at 3 p.m. on the 18th and then return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Flies to Shanghai, Then to the United States</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Du Yuming is scheduled to fly directly from Shenyang to Shanghai on the morning of the 19th, then to the United States for medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Balloon Over Qingdao Mistaken for a Flying Saucer</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Qingdao, 18th] Today, rumors that a "flying saucer" flew over Qingdao are rampant, and the sky over Qingdao was quite sensational for a while. At about 9:40 a.m., the saucer appeared in the city's sky, about 3,000 meters above the ground. Residents of the Dongzhen area were all eager to see this strange object that was as bright as a fireball. The saucer gradually disappeared from west to east. At about 4 p.m., the saucer was found in the city's sky again, and the viewers were crowded, which proves that the information in the Wei Xin newspaper is not false. The reporter did not witness the flying saucer, but does not believe that it must be a balloon used for meteorological observation. After betting with a senior official of a certain agency, he inquired in all directions. In the evening, he inquired from the Qingdao Observatory that the station had released balloons twice today, and the time, direction, height, etc. were completely consistent with what was seen.</p>
<h3>Women's Group Representatives Petition the National Government</h3>
<p>Please Correct Election Quota Errors</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] At 10 a.m. on the morning of the 18th, women's groups sent representatives Shen Huiyun, Zou Zhao Shujia, Li Jianhong, Zhuang Jing, Tang Guozhen, and others, a total of ten people, to petition the State Council Meeting. The National Government sent Chief Aide-de-Camp Xue Yue to meet them. The purpose of this women's abundance petition is twofold: (1) The Legislative Yuan stipulates that national women's groups must have at least five branches, which violates the People's Organizations Law, and the State Council Meeting is requested to correct this. (2) The 168 representatives of women's groups should be allocated to national and local women's groups. The current allocation to various regions based on population is also wrong. Women's groups will fight to the end to correct this error and request that the draft of 33 names allocated by the Ministry of Social Affairs be maintained.</p>
<h3>Wu Xianzihui Issues a Message Hoping That the Democratic Socialist Party Will End Internal Strife</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Wu Xianzihui, Vice Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, recently issued a letter to party members, recounting the causes of the dispute and the failure of mediation, emphasizing that the dispute was due to disagreements on political views, not a matter of party discipline. He proposed remedial measures, hoping that the representatives of the National Congress of the party would, in accordance with the purpose of unity, promote cooperation between the two sides and expect the congress to revise the resolution passed by the Organizing Committee to expel Sun Baogang and others from the party's "Reform Committee".

<h3>Responsible Authorities Inquire About the Truth of the Mongolian Army's Invasion of Suiyuan; Fu Zuoyi Will Go to Beijing in the Short Term to Ask for Instructions</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The official has not yet confirmed the news that the Outer Mongolian army invaded the northeastern part of Suiyuan along the Zhangjiakou-Kulan Avenue.

If it is true, they should quickly collect evidence and report it for negotiation. According to news from related parties: Because the Mongolian side had border issues with us from time to time, General Fu Zuoyi may come to Beijing in the short term to pay respects to the authorities and ask for instructions in order to fulfill the important responsibility of defending the border.</p>

<p>Grain Production Increase Plan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] In order to enrich the military, refine the people's livelihood, and aim for self-sufficiency within three years, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has submitted a "Outline Draft of Grain Production Increase Plan" to the National Economic Commission. The key points of the plan are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>I. Objective</p>
<p>To increase food production, enrich the military's food supply and people's livelihood, reduce food import leakage, and pay special attention to food supply in food-deficient cities, aiming for self-sufficiency in the third year.</p>
<p>II. Work Area</p>
<p>Food-deficient areas are mostly densely populated and located in large cities, totaling six locations (locations seen in yesterday's newspaper). According to normal production and marketing conditions, there are eight areas that can potentially supply food (locations seen in yesterday's newspaper). The increase production work should be carried out separately in each increase production supply area, selecting a central base and establishing a supervisory mechanism, and then selecting subsidiary bases based on the distribution of various food crops in the area and establishing working mechanisms. Increase production and supply are divided into eight districts, with eight central bases established. District agricultural experiment fields and promotion breeding methods are established in the central bases. There are a total of fifty-one subsidiary bases in the districts. In addition to making full use of the original central institutions, strengthening and adjusting them, each district also cooperates with the provincial government, making use of local institutions, and establishing necessary institutions in places where no institutions have been established.</p>
<p>III. Work Items</p>
<p>The crops for increase production are rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potato, potato, vegetables, and soybeans, nine kinds in total. However, for crop improvement before the war and food production increase work during the war, the improved materials and methods that have already achieved results and are practically available should be concentrated on and actively promoted in important production areas to achieve quick results. At the same time, considering the complex and special situation of production problems in various places, experiments and improvement work will be carried out, so that not only can significant results be achieved in increase production work within three years, but also a national long-term improvement foundation can be established. The items are as follows six points (seen in yesterday's newspaper).</p>
<p>IV. Work Goals</p>
<p>The proposed increase production quantity (market load) for each year.</p>
<p>V. Expected Effects (omitted)</p>
<p>VI. Handling Institutions</p>
<p>The implementation of this plan is presided over by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Agricultural Extension Committee will cooperate to be responsible for handling it separately. In order to coordinate the design and strengthen contact, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Central Agricultural Institute and the Agricultural Extension Committee will jointly organize a Grain Production Increase Statistics Committee with relevant agencies. Its organizational charter and detailed measures will be determined separately.</p>
<p>VII. Handling Personnel</p>
<p>The total number of high school, junior high school, and tertiary level professional and technical personnel required is approximately 210 people, with 90 people to be appointed starting in July of this year. The total number of high school, junior high school, and tertiary level extension technical personnel is 990 people, with 300 people to be appointed starting in July. The total number of other administrative personnel and laborers is 2,410 people, with 630 people to be hired starting in July.</p>
<p>VIII. Phased Progress (omitted)</p>
<p>IX. Budget Estimate</p>
<p>(1) Total budget of 40 billion yuan from July to December of the 36th year. Among them, 19 billion yuan for start-up costs and 21 billion yuan for business expenses. (2) Total budget of 80 billion yuan from January to December of the 37th year, including 25 billion yuan for start-up costs and 55 billion yuan for business expenses.</p>

<h3>Continued Collection and Borrowing of Goods This Year; Proposal by Zhang Qun and Others Approved by the State Council; To Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Proper Drafting of a Plan for Swift Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The case of continuing to collect and borrow goods this year to fill the military, has been approved at the State Council meeting on the 18th. The case was proposed by Zhang Qun, Wang Yunwu, and Weng Wenhao, and its three principles are as follows: (1) The collection of goods will be handled by the Ministry of Food according to the original plan, and the quota collection rate will remain unchanged. The provinces and counties should receive 70%, all of which will be purchased by the central government; (2) The borrowing will be carried out according to the original allocation borrowing amount determined by the Ministry of Food; (3) In areas with disaster-caused crop failures or insufficient collection and borrowing, additional purchases will be made to make up for the shortfall. According to this proposal, it is to cooperate with the mobilization to quell the rebellion. In the situation of enriching the first-line corps and establishing the second-line corps, the military food demand will inevitably increase. If calculated at 4.5 million people, the annual demand is 40.5 million dan. The Ministry of Food's original plan was to collect more than 20.8 million shi this year, which is only half of the required military food. Therefore, in order to seek sufficient food and soldiers, in addition to the collection of goods, borrowing, purchasing, and buying foreign wheat should also be carried out to meet the required amount. After the case is passed, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for proper drafting of a plan for swift implementation.</p>
<h3>Urban Economic Control Program Divided into Three Major Sectors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The "Draft Urban Economic Control Program" drafted by the Executive Yuan was discussed at the National Economic Commission on the 17th. Because it had many similarities with the Economic Emergency Measures Program, it was decided that the financial economy and others would review it again, select the more novel ones, and formulate supplementary measures separately. It is learned that the original case, except for the cotton yarn sector, is roughly similar to the Economic Emergency Measures. The implementation area is the 32 negotiated price areas designated by the Economic Emergency Measures Program. The content of the case is divided into three major sectors: first, the control of six major categories of important materials such as food, fuel, daily necessities, salt, cotton yarn, and sugar. Second, the control of the financial industry, divided into ten items: (1) supervision of the use of bank funds, (2) management of remittance circulation, (3) supervision of the legal circulation of bills, (4) credit control, (5) interest rate control, (6) guidance of speculative funds in legitimate activities, (7) crackdown on speculative trading, (8) strengthening of bank inspections, correction of illegal acts of banks and illegal acts of responsible persons and employees, crackdown on underground banks, (9) crackdown on smuggling activities, (10) strengthening of industry association organizations. Third, the control of wages.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Intensifies Collection of This Year's Income Tax</h3>
<p>Deadline Set for End of August</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] In order to implement the Economic Emergency Measures Program and strengthen the collection of business income tax, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that taxpayers should declare their income before April 15th, pay in advance, and then conduct investigations to verify the tax amount. However, the Chambers of Commerce in various places have repeatedly delayed the process by obstructing the inspection of accounts. In order to take into account the business community and accelerate the tax payment procedures, the Ministry has reduced the number of accounting units and expanded the scope of standard taxation. Recently, the highest authorities have reported that the profit tax of business enterprises this year has been overdue in many places. In order to meet the needs of general mobilization, they have specifically instructed Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance to strictly limit the collection to the treasury by the end of August. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed various direct tax bureaus and Chambers of Commerce in various places to intensify collection from now on, with the end of August as the final deadline.</p>

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has transferred the order to the Cotton Adjustment Committee for compliance. In addition, according to the measures for stabilizing yarn prices by the former Cotton Yarn Control Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, yarn factories that use national foreign exchange to purchase foreign cotton as raw materials should have half of their cotton yarn output purchased by the government. The same method should be adopted for factories that supply cotton from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Regarding the price of yarn purchased from UNRRA cotton, the Cotton Adjustment Committee of the Ministry has recently consulted with the National Bank and the persons in charge of the Shanghai Six Districts Textile Industry Association and decided that it will be 6.5 million yuan per piece and that more than 30,000 pieces must be delivered within one week.</p>

As for whether the Soviet Union agrees, it was not considered on our behalf.

<h3>Secretary-General of the Far Eastern Commission Jenson Issues Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Secretary-General Jenson of the Far Eastern Commission issued a lengthy report today, reporting on the activities of the eleven member states from February 26, 1946 to July 10, 1947. Jenson stated that the Commission's dual objectives are as follows: One is to formulate policy principles and standards so that Japan can fulfill its surrender conditions accordingly. One is to study any instructions issued and any actions taken by MacArthur at the request of any member state.</p>
<p>Jenson explained that the Far Eastern Commission does not make any recommendations on military action and territorial adjustments. The term of office of the Commission has not been determined, but once it is decided that the Commission will cease to exercise its powers, the Commission will immediately cease to exercise its powers. The Meiji Constitution of 1889, although seemingly disguised as freedom, was in fact an extremely undemocratic constitution, and at the same time had a great impact on the maintenance of the basic feudal organization of the Japanese people. During the period of military aggression, the constitution was used as a tool, and Japanese militarists and extreme nationalists were able to gain political power and exercise their power. The Commission believes that the preservation of the academic system is not entirely desirable, and we should encourage the Japanese people to reform the academic system in a more democratic direction. The report also reviewed the various achievements of the Council, such as the policies of the Japanese surrender, the issue of compensation, economic leisure, democratic tendencies, crime issues, and disarmament issues, and emphasized the implementation of the Potsdam Declaration clauses governing Japan's post-war status.</p>
<h3>Time Limit for Applying for the Return of Robbed Machinery Should Not Be Specified</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Intervenes with the Allied Headquarters</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th Dispatch] I have just learned from the Taiwan Provincial Government that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised objections to MacArthur's Headquarters' deadline for applying for the return of robbed machinery. The person in charge of MacArthur's Headquarters once stated: "The machinery robbed by the Japanese in the past is limited to applying for return before July of this year. If the time limit is exceeded, it will be transferred to compensation items." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that there is no basis for this deadline in the resolution of the Far Eastern Commission, and the Japanese people generally conceal and do not report the items they have robbed, and it takes a lot of time for our country to investigate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Ambassador Gu Weijun, requesting the US government to instruct MacArthur's Headquarters not to set a deadline. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered our delegation in Japan to strive nearby to cancel the deadline so that we can apply for the return of robbed items by the Japanese in China at any time.</p>
<h3>Valuation and Allocation of Compensation Items Actively Planned</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The industrial equipment that Japan compensates our country for has been decided by the Executive Yuan Compensation Committee that "equipment that can be provided to private operation can be allocated for use at a price."

Currently, the Executive Yuan Compensation Committee is inviting relevant agencies to discuss payment methods, contract styles, valuation methods, review standards, application forms, factory construction plan styles, etc., in order to speed up the process.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Increases the Number of Security Teams; The Security Regiments in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts Decided to Change Their Names</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 18th Dispatch] The First Pacification Area Headquarters previously strengthened the local self-defense forces in northern Jiangsu, and with the approval of the Army Headquarters, ordered the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Administrative Regions to organize security regiments.

Their attempt is to occupy the mountain area and then re-enter the plain. The bandits lurking in Siming Mountain are also acting in all directions, but mostly at night, so it is difficult to eliminate them. Currently, there are no bandits in Sanbei, only lurking along the coast, intimidating towns and villages. Therefore, the future strategy is how to prevent the landing of bandits again.

<p>The total number of receiving personnel is tentatively set at 222.</p>
<p>[Reported from Nanjing by our newspaper on the 18th] Regarding the expenditure and personnel issues concerning the 482,218 tons of materials for early compensation from Japan for demolition and relocation, the Compensation Committee has conducted a detailed study. The expenditure portion has been submitted to the Chairman for approval, and an initial allocation of 100 billion yuan has been made and distributed to relevant agencies for use. As for personnel, the total number of receiving personnel is tentatively set at 222, including specialized members, commissioners, and team leaders, as well as technical personnel and advisors for investigation. In addition, there will be 15 to 20 specialized personnel who will serve as representatives for compensation and return of materials stationed in Japan, handling the selection, supervision, and dismantling of these materials. The salaries and allowances for these technical specialists will be included in the expenses of the Receiving Committee, in addition to the total number of receiving personnel mentioned above. Regarding the dismantling costs for the first batch of demolition and relocation materials and (factory construction costs, which refer to the expenses for the three years from the 36th to the 38th year of the Republic), 1.2 trillion national currency and 50 million US dollars are required. However, this was an estimate made in February of this year. Furthermore, among these 480,000 tons of materials, it is planned to allocate approximately 32,470 tons to private enterprises. Recently, the Executive Yuan ordered that the allocation quantity for private enterprises be increased as much as possible. The total number of 222 receiving personnel is determined based on the allocation ratio between private and state-owned enterprises in the future. The number of personnel assigned to each sector, regarding the private sector allocation, will be determined by the Compensation Committee, which will immediately draft the allocation ratio between state-owned and private enterprises and submit it to the Executive Yuan for a decision.</p>

<p>The seawall in western Zhejiang is becoming increasingly dangerous. Hydraulic experts from Zhongye have visited the area several times and all agree that the Zhe and Er Mountains are too small. Although they form the spectacular Qiantang Bore, they are actually the weakest point of the seawall. Therefore, they have suggested that the central government blow up the two mountains to ensure long-term peace and tranquility. It is rumored that the central government has decided to implement this plan during the low tide at the end of this year. If so, the Qiantang Bore, famous both at home and abroad, will no longer be seen.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Guangzhou: Over 200 Houses Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Reported from Guangzhou by our newspaper on the 18th] A major fire recently broke out here in the Xidi area behind the old site of the Daxin Company, along Ermalu, Jingyuan, Tongxing, and Tongwen roads. This area was previously razed to the ground by a fire during the Japanese occupation and is now known as the disaster area. After the restoration, the authorities designated this area as a market for various sundries, with merchants building over a thousand wooden houses for business. Around 12:00 PM today, a fire broke out at Tongxing Store No. 47 on Tongxing Road due to a fire involving tung oil, which quickly spread and ignited the oil in nearby warehouses, causing the fire to become extremely fierce. After the fire brigade's efforts to extinguish it, the fire was finally put out at 3:00 PM. A total of over 200 houses were burned down. At the time, there were over 10,000 barrels of gasoline stored in the area, and at least 5,000 barrels were burned despite rescue efforts. Other materials have not yet been counted, but the estimated loss must be over 3 billion yuan. Fortunately, the neighboring Provincial Bank and Public Welfare warehouses were not affected, otherwise the losses would have been even greater. However, there were no casualties.</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Comprehensive Review of Economic Laws and Regulations!</h3>
<p>—The Key to the Success or Failure of the General Mobilization Plan—</p>
<p>The Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government through Mobilization to Suppress Rebellion, consisting of eighteen articles, was submitted by the Executive Yuan to the State Council yesterday morning, passed, and promulgated for implementation. Among them, the ones related to the economy are Articles 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12, which can be categorized by nature as follows: (1) regulations for requisition and expropriation, (2) sanctions against hoarding and speculation, (3) maintenance of production and social order, (4) control of daily necessities, finance, trade, and wages, (5) assistance and construction for production and transportation enterprises, and (6) regulation of national revenue and expenditure. All departments related to finance, currency, prices, wages, trade, production, and transportation are included; moreover, in addition to passive control, it also covers active assistance and construction. In terms of economic administration, this is undoubtedly a major measure.</p>
<p>Article 15 of the original draft states that if detailed regulations need to be formulated separately, the relevant ministries of the Executive Yuan shall draft the measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, which shall be promulgated and implemented by order. The above articles are, of course, broad outlines, merely stipulating a framework and principles. As for how to implement these principles within this framework, it remains for the relevant ministries to formulate, and what we believe is worthy of attention and discussion are these implementation measures.</p>
<p>In fact, except for requisition and expropriation, which need to be decided according to the mobilization situation, the other items are not without ready-made methods. For example, in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the "Measures for Prohibiting Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" has been restored in connection with the item of hoarding and speculation; for the control of daily necessities, the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures for the Supply of Daily Necessities" have been formulated; for the regulation and management of various production enterprises, the "Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" have been restored; and for the two items of prices and wages, there are "Regulations for Prohibiting Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations" and "Measures for Evaluating Wages" to follow. The financial and fiscal items also have clear provisions in the Emergency Measures Plan. In addition, the implementation of production loans, the organization of farmland irrigation, and various newly established regulations can be seen at any time. Moreover, in addition to the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, local governments have at any time and place formulated numerous measures regarding prohibiting price gouging, speculation and manipulation, and prohibiting outbound and transit trade.</p>
<p>Currently, various central laws and local regulations have not been expressly abolished. Now, with the mobilization to suppress rebellion and the separate enactment of an implementation outline, will a new stove be started, and a new set of rules be formulated? Or will the old rules be followed, and the current laws and regulations continue to be used? Or will more additions and supplements be made to strengthen their effectiveness? At present, these are all unknowns, but in order to support the suppression of rebellion and promote mobilization, we must hope that the authorities will thoroughly consider and reorganize these laws and regulations. Because today's economic crisis in our country, how to overcome it, is no longer a question of whether there are laws and regulations, but a question of whether the laws and regulations are too complicated and whether the execution is effective.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the results of the implementation of these laws and regulations in the past have to be said to be failures or disappointments. Look at the prohibition of hoarding and the prohibition of prices in various places, which are not based on these laws and regulations? But in fact, the hoarding trend is becoming more intense, and the price increase trend is becoming more rampant, in direct proportion to the number of laws and regulations. This is obvious to everyone. For example, national banks have spared no effort to lend hundreds of billions of dollars to promote production, assist exports, and assist farmers, and the state has specially set up several institutions to promote these assistance efforts, but industry and commerce seem to be increasingly declining, and the countryside is becoming more and more collapsed. Exported goods have already risen too high before they are exported, and export trade is still forced to a standstill. It can be seen that these assistances, at least in fact, did not hit the key points and achieve the expected results. As for the mediation of labor and capital, the strict prohibition of strikes, work stoppages, shutdowns, and other behaviors that hinder production and social order, the authorities have long emphasized it repeatedly, but unfortunately, the speakers are sincere, and the listeners are indifferent. To this day, labor disputes that do not listen to mediation and do not accept arbitration still occur one after another. This cannot be said to be a lack of laws and regulations. In fact, from the perspective of some people, it seems that laws and regulations are one thing, and actual actions are another. The people's psychology and the government's expectations have become divergent, so that many actions have gone off track, and countless laws and regulations have become mere formalities! This is the biggest problem in today's economic issues and the biggest difficulty that should be overcome when implementing general mobilization!</p>
<p>How should these difficulties be overcome? First, it should naturally start with personnel, and second, it should also start with the laws and regulations themselves. Let's put aside the personnel issue for now and focus on the legal issue.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the current various economic laws and regulations is that there are too many and too chaotic, the second is that they are too strict and unreasonable, and the third is that they are too rash and fluid, making people think that they change every day.</p>
<p>Let's give a few examples to prove it. Taking the suppression of rice and grain as an example: the Regulations on Prohibiting Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations can be applied, the Measures for Prohibiting Hoarding and Speculation can be applied, the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce and Mining can be applied, and of course, the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Food Administration can also be applied. Since there are so many laws and regulations, and the degree of leniency and strictness varies greatly, the most severe can be applied to military law. If you want to be lenient, you might as well use administrative sanctions. For the same case, if one part is subject to administrative sanctions, another part must be transferred to the judiciary. Such complexity makes the parties confused, and the case handlers have to go to great lengths. As a result, people who break the law cannot help but try to escape the law. This is an example of too much and too chaos.</p>
<p>Take hoarding and speculation as another example, in addition to the various local penalties, Article 3 of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures for the Supply of Daily Necessities" stipulates that those who make use of their occupation or other special relations to purchase and store daily necessities in large quantities with the intention of monopolizing or raising prices shall be punished according to the law. So, literally, those who do not purchase and store in large quantities should naturally not be in violation of the law. But what is the number that constitutes a large amount of purchase and storage? The law has no clear provisions. It also states: Storing items and not selling them on the market, but raising prices beyond legal profits, is an act of speculation. The legal profit in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the competent authorities at any time, taking into account local conditions. (Article 4) According to this article, if the price increase does not exceed the legal profit, or even if it exceeds it, the competent authorities have not determined the legal profit for these many items at any time, should it be considered an act of speculation? Should it be punished? This also seems to be a question. According to Articles 9, 13, and 15 of the law, anyone who produces, purchases, stores, or sells such items must register or report to the trade association each time or periodically. In addition to reporting to the authorities in accordance with the law, the association must also check and correct them at any time. The procedures are so trivial. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, can it actually be done? Does the competent authority have so many personnel to review, inspect, and correct them? If there is no effort to review, inspect, and correct, and everything is filed away and put on the shelf, what is the point of asking businessmen to go through so many procedures?</p>
<p>On February 6 of this year, the export subsidy system was implemented, but it was cancelled when the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was promulgated on February 17. The Ministry of Finance formulated the "Measures for Handling Gold Ornaments for Silver Shops and Jewelry Stores" on February 20, but due to too many conflicts, it formulated the "Measures for the Management of Silver Shops' Acceptance and Manufacture of Gold Ornaments" on March 23. Other examples include the sudden tightening and loosening of the inland transportation of yarn and cloth, the sudden suspension of subsidies for public utilities, the sudden permission and rejection of foreign exchange purchases of foreign goods, and the sudden freezing and unfreezing of the cost of living index. The effective period of persistence is mostly only two or three months, and less than four or five days. Although the authorities have to adapt to the situation due to the too strong price fluctuations and the too rapid changes in the situation, it still gives people the feeling that the orders are changed every day. The damage to the people's psychology of abiding by the law and the authority of national laws is really not small. These are all examples of being too rash in legislation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate that if you want to control to take effect and mobilization to take effect, then these laws and regulations really need to be thoroughly reviewed and reorganized. All contradictory, redundant, and unreasonable parts must be deleted, merged, and simplified quickly, so that the context is clear, neat, and uniform. Then, the people who execute the laws and regulations and abide by the laws and regulations will be clear at a glance, and there will be no trouble of being caught in a hurry. Although Emperor Gaozu of Han's three-chapter law may not be applicable to today, the simplicity and clarity of economic laws and regulations is really undeniable. If a new stove has to be started and re-established, then these restrictive laws and regulations are best to be completely destroyed and cleared, and explicitly abolished. Do not stack them on top of each other like piled firewood, more and more, so that good citizens who abide by the law are in danger of violating the ban everywhere, and unscrupulous officials can take advantage of these complexities and contradictions to manipulate and make profits. This is the key to the turning point of economic control and the key to the success or failure of the general mobilization plan, which we believe is worthy of attention.</p>

<h3>The United States Should Strengthen Its Position in Greece To Prevent Soviet Influence From Extending: Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee Expresses</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Radio: Regarding the US actions in Greece to counter the Soviet Union, in addition to Marshal's expression, Chairman Eden of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee also made a frank statement in the House meeting today. He expressed extreme indignation at the Polish representative's request in the Security Council for the withdrawal of US military forces from Greece. It is said: "The United States must maintain its position in Greece, otherwise the Soviet Union will take the opportunity to invade, and if so, the fate of the Balkans will be in danger."</p>
<p>Further news: Greek planes strafed retreating guerrillas today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 17th] It is learned that after the counterattack by the government forces in northern Greece, the guerrillas retreating to the Albanian border have begun to engage in strong new positions. Government forces are currently carrying out mopping-up operations in mountainous areas 3,000 feet above sea level. According to Greek Public Security Minister Chairvales, the attacking teams that invaded Greece consist of eight battalions, each with approximately 300 people, all equipped very well. These eight battalions simultaneously crossed the border at three points, of which two battalions belong to foreign-organized troops, and one battalion is a Tito unit. Two battalions advanced towards Ko Niza after invading, and the remaining six battalions advanced towards Je Nina, the capital of Epirus Province. The Albanian border was originally undefended. After Je Nina City issued a warning, it sent some police and army liaison teams to meet the enemy and surrounded the enemy in Mount Kala Yi, but they relied on the terrain to escape.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Athens, 17th] The Greek Cabinet decided at its meeting today to instruct Cabinet Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, who is currently in the United States, to stay in Washington to continue negotiations with the United States on aid to Greece. On the other hand, it was decided to order Interior Minister Papandreou to cancel his trip to the United States and return directly to his country.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, 17th] Rumors that an "international military brigade" has been formed in Yugoslavia to interfere in the Greek civil war have been denied by the Yugoslav government in a statement. It also said that this news is intended to deceive world public opinion and provide an excuse for foreign interference in Greece's internal affairs. According to this news, which was transmitted by the Greek side and published by several foreign news agencies and newspapers, it was specifically pointed out that a senior Yugoslav military officer is involved in this "international military brigade."</p>
<h3>"Free Communist Party" Propaganda Group – A "Free" Government in Greece?</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 17th] It is learned today that a "Free Communist Party" state is about to be declared in northern Greece, with its government potentially located in the Grammos Mountains near the Albanian border. According to the official newspaper of the National Liberation Front, controlled by the Communist Party, a guerrilla radio station will broadcast a statement by leader Vifiadis, arguing that it is absolutely necessary to establish an independent Communist government in the "liberated areas" of northern Greece "to prevent Greece from being subjected to foreign interference and becoming a flashpoint for Balkan wars." A high-ranking official in Allied diplomatic circles stated that the declaration of a Communist government may benefit the governments of various Soviet satellite states, allowing them to formally recognize the guerrillas and provide open assistance. According to Communist newspaper reports, the radio station was founded by the "Greek Democratic Army" headquarters and broadcasts for two hours daily. The Foreign Ministry stated that the guerrilla radio station has been broadcasting for two days, but its location is not within Greece, likely in Bulgaria or the capital of Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>Opposition to Establishing a Balkan Border Commission – The Soviet Union Intends to Use Its Veto – Two Vassal States Wave the Flag in Support</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 19th (broadcast): According to a Bulgarian official, the Soviet Union is determined to use its veto to oppose the United States' proposal for a United Nations border commission to police the Balkans. The official requested that his name not be disclosed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 17th] Although the United States seeks to quickly resolve the Balkan issue in the Security Council, Balkan Soviet vassal states and their supporters have clearly decided to delay the matter. During today's continuation of the Security Council's discussion on the Greek issue, representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia delivered lengthy speeches defending Greece's three northern neighbors: Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. Several other representatives also engaged in lengthy and fruitless debates. At the same time, Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko launched another strong offensive, opposing the US proposal to establish a semi-permanent Balkan commission. Gromyko delivered a 45-minute speech in harsh Russian, arguing that the aforementioned proposal violated the UN Charter and reality. He stated that if the Security Council accepted the US proposal, it would mean the Security Council was deciding to violate the UN Charter.</p>
<h3>The Greek Situation – Turkey Feels Anxious</h3>

Turkey will witness the formation of a Slavic-controlled government in northern Greece, whose influence may extend to the Turkish border. Such a situation would allow the Soviet Union to control the Dardanelles Strait.</p>

<h3>Einstein – Advocates for World Government</h3>

Sjahrir stated that he understands that the Dutch do not intend to use force, as the ultimatum stated in their declaration has already passed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 18th] Qualified Dutch sources stated after the Indonesian Republic responded to the Dutch final proposal that the situation is not as bad as generally imagined.

<p>Indonesia Awaits Dutch Response</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 18th] The Indonesian government submitted a note to Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook yesterday afternoon and is now awaiting his response. People here are mostly worried. Observers believe that if the Indonesian side wants to prevent armed conflict, it can only appeal to the United Nations or the International Court of Justice for arbitration, or ask a third country to mediate. It is reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir met with the US and British consuls-general in Batavia yesterday.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 17th] After arriving here, the Indonesian Minister of Justice immediately visited Van Mook and handed him two notes: (1) Indonesia requests the organization of a domestic security guidance committee under the guidance of the Indonesian Provisional Government, composed of Dutch authorities and representatives of various states; (2) Stop all preparations aimed at resolving the Indonesian issue by force and order the immediate cessation of similar war activities by the army, navy, and air force.</p>

<h3>Latent Crisis of Civil War in Italy – The Communist Party Spares No Effort in Criticizing the Government – US Export-Import Bank Loans Italy $100 Million</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 17th] Italian Communist Party Chairman Togliatti stated in his address to the party's executive committee that the Gasperi government is laying the groundwork for civil war. He said that the enemies of the working class are doing their best to provoke workers and using the police to deal with labor leaders. Even if this is not intentional preparation for civil war, it is enough to cause a civil war. There are two purposes: one is to weaken the Communist Party's strength, and the other is to cut off the Communist Party's contact with other democratic parties. Our purpose is to consolidate and expand democratic forces, while our enemies' purpose is the opposite. We, the left-wing parties, must intensify our work to undermine the right-wing government. Italian political figures generally believe that since the Gasperi government took office a month ago, the domestic situation has become increasingly unstable. The current situation is very similar to the eve of the Fascist takeover, which makes those who care about national affairs deeply worried.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the US loan to Italy, US Export-Import Bank officials were sent to Italy to study the country's economic situation. After several months, they returned here today. The Export-Import Bank immediately decided to allocate $100 million in loans to Italy.

<h3>People in Thirteen Provinces of Korea Express – Willingness to Cooperate Sincerely with the United States – And Say that Opposition to Trusteeship Is Not Anti-American</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] President Truman today received a joint letter from representatives of thirteen provinces of Korea (including provinces in the Soviet-occupied zone), guaranteeing Korea's goodwill and sincere willingness to cooperate with the United States. This letter has been released by the Korean delegation here. It expresses opposition to the trusteeship plan for Korea, saying that it violates the principle of independence. At the same time, it declares support for the anti-communist movement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Korean Commission distributed to newspapers here on the 17th the telegram from the Korean People's Congress in Seoul (an informal national congress) to President Truman and the Senate and House of Representatives, stating that the Congress is fighting against the anti-American movement of the Communist Party, which disregards the United States' neutral policy. The telegram pointed out that the rumor that the Korean people oppose the presence of people in Korea is completely inaccurate and expresses regret for this rumor. The article also stated: "Our refusal to accept trusteeship should not be regarded as anti-American. We oppose trusteeship because this move violates independence, and also because we will not be able to prevent the spread of the Communist Party." The letter continued, stating that they are now planning to hold general elections to organize a provisional government representing the entire country. The Congress expressed its gratitude for the relief and recovery assistance being drafted by the United States, saying that this assistance is indeed extremely needed.</p>

<h3>Raising the Level of German Industrial Production – Britain and the United States Still Have Conflicting Opinions – Britain Has Not Yet Agreed to Participate in Washington Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that Britain has not yet expressed its acceptance of the US invitation to discuss Ruhr coal production in Washington. London generally believes that Britain has not expressed its acceptance because it hopes that the scope of the meeting can be expanded.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Britain's suggestion that the United States bear the majority of the expenses in the British and American combined zones in Germany has been resolutely rejected by the United States. At the same time, the United States has rejected Britain's other plan to move the German coal production conference, which was originally scheduled to be held here next week, to Berlin. Regarding the new standards of German industrial planning, due to the differences between Britain and the United States, it is still at a standstill. US officials hope that all difficulties can be overcome soon. There are countless differences between Britain and the United States, some of which are related to the basic handling of German issues, and what is currently most troubling to Britain is that it must use a large amount of gold dollars in Germany. Since the merger of the two zones last December, the two governments have agreed to share all expenses equally. This has led Britain to hope that the United States can bear more of the burden, but the United States has not allowed it. The former US Secretary of State told British Foreign Secretary Bevin that if Britain is willing to exchange occupation zones, the United States can pay more for occupation fees. The US-occupied zone is the poorest zone in Germany, while the British-occupied zone is the most substantial in Germany, as it includes the wealthiest Ruhr industrial area. US officials replied to Britain that if Britain is willing to exchange occupation zones, the United States can pay more for occupation fees. As for the coal conference, it was originally announced on July 11th that Britain agreed to send a delegation to Washington for the meeting. Since then, Britain has wanted to expand the scope of the meeting to include the financial and food situation in the two zones, as well as other economic issues, but the United States has strictly refused. Although the United States is not opposed to discussing all economic issues with Britain, the United States currently believes that the coal issue is the most important. Before a way can be found to increase coal production, there is no time to consider other issues. Finally, Britain also agreed that only the coal issue will be discussed at the meeting.</p>
<h3>On the German Issue – France Reaffirms Its Position</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] At today's meeting of the European Economic Cooperation Committee, the Dutch representative stated that all of Germany's untapped production potential should be utilized so that Germany's industrial productivity can be increased to the maximum extent. The French representative, the Director of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alphonse, immediately stood up and replied that France will never allow the revival of German industry without sufficient security guarantees. The French government believes that the need for security is more important than the industrial revival of Germany, and we must continue to consider this in our future work.</p>
<h3>US Governors Conference – Supports the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Salt Lake City, Utah, 17th] The 39th annual meeting of the governors of the 48 US states closed today, unanimously passing a resolution expressing support for the non-partisan US foreign policy aimed at establishing world peace. The resolution stated: "The foreign policy of the United States, beyond party, individual, or political motives, should always be a US foreign policy that represents the best policy of the United States, showing the world that the United States is a country seeking peace, and unanimously decided to safeguard the inalienable rights and interests enjoyed by US citizens." New York Governor Dewey later expressed the opinion that this resolution has made the nation's governors firmly support the government in completing world peace and will never be regarded as a proclamation of isolationism. In addition, the Governors' Conference resolved to ask Congress to enact legislation for universal military training for American youth.</p>
<h3>US Army Personnel</h3>
<p>Reduced by Seven-Eighths Compared to Wartime</p>

According to the Army authorities, the current number of soldiers discharged each week is 7,000, while the number of new recruits who should be enlisted in the first week of July is only 4,318. July has always been one of the months with the best recruitment results in a year, so the number of troops decreases by at least 2,682 per week. The current number of US troops is already 80,000 less than the minimum amount set by the General Staff approved by the National Power Grid for carrying out global occupation responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Sweeping France – 300,000 Artisans Prepare to Petition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 18th] Paris Central Post Office employees, protesting the National Federation of Civil Servants' acceptance of the government's civil servant salary plan, unofficially went on strike for one day yesterday and resumed work today. 300,000 construction workers and carpenters in Paris are demanding that construction subsidies continue to be issued.

<h3>The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Adjourns – The Next Session Will Be Held in the Philippines</h3>
<p>[UN Office in Shanghai, Chenggong Lake, 17th] The Committee of the Whole of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its last meeting here today, unanimously resolving that the next session of the Economic and Social Commission will be held in the Philippines in late November. Secretary-General Trygve Lie will consult with the Philippine government to determine whether the meeting will be held in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, or in other locations in the country. The Siamese representative, Waset Ya Ganli, urged the Economic Commission to consider holding the third session in Siam and suggested that the meetings should be held in rotation in various countries in Asia and the Far East. New Zealand's application to join as a member state has been transferred by the Committee of the Whole to the Economic Commission for a decision at the next session. When the Economic Commission held its first session in Shanghai last month, representatives from China, India, Siam, and the Philippines all invited the Economic Commission to hold its next session in their respective countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 17th] The United States suggested yesterday in the Security Council that the issue of whether former Japanese vassal states are qualified to attend the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East should be directly decided by the Allied Headquarters in Japan, but the Soviet Union suggested that it should be decided by the "Allied Authorities." As a result, the US proposal was passed by a vote of seven to two. It is reported that the Soviet Union still plans to submit its proposal to the Economic and Social Council.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 17th] Jiang Tingfu, the Chinese representative to the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and Chairman of the Commission, issued the following statement to the Central News Agency reporter alone after the close of the Committee of the Whole of the Commission. The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has resolved the membership issue for autonomous countries, such as Ceylon, Vietnam, and Indonesia, by allowing these countries to be sponsoring member states, which can participate in all the work of the Commission and its various institutions, but will not have the right to vote in the Commission itself. There was a time when the debate on this issue was very intense, but the Chinese delegation, in cooperation with other countries, was finally able to reach a compromise. One encouraging thing about the Committee of the Whole was that the general public attending the meeting understood the mission it was responsible for. If the member states attending the meeting can make good use of its achievements, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East can assume an important function in the economic development of Asia.</p>

Zhang was all smiles, shaking hands and thanking them one by one, and said that the bride was still in Peiping. When asked about the date of her arrival in the south, he smiled without answering. It is reported that Zhang held a secret and simple wedding on the 16th of this month, with only his second sister, Mrs. Xu Zhimo, his fourth sister, Mrs. Zhu Wenxiong, and other relatives and friends attending the ceremony.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Four people, including Rui Baogong, General Affairs Director of National Fudan University, were prosecuted yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office for the crime of "destroying and damaging property." After the victory, a large air-raid shelter built by the enemy puppets remained on the Jiangwan Fudan University campus. Last winter, Zhang Guoxian (30 years old, residing at No. 5, Luyan Road, Weidemai Road, teacher) discussed it with Rui and, under the false name of building a Guo Ji Elementary School, secretly entered into a demolition contract with foreman Che Jigui. Che Jigui then received a starting fee of 1 million yuan from Rui and immediately started the demolition work. The demolition work started at the end of December last year and lasted until mid-May of this year, when the project was completely dismantled, resulting in two tons of iron bars, 160,000 bricks and tiles, and more than 50 cubic meters of three-component soil. At that time, Zhang was short of cash, so he used two tons of old iron dismantled to offset the wages and handed it over to Che Liang for sale to Guo Ruimao (47 years old, residing at No. 784, Dongyuhang Road, businessman). After the case was discovered by the local police station, the entire case file was transferred to the Preparatory Department and forwarded to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After interrogation, the District Prosecutor's Office found that the defendants had confessed to all of the above, and believed that the defendants Zhang Guoxian and Rui Baogong had violated Article 28, Article 29, Paragraph 1, and Article 353, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Zhang Guoxian had violated Article 320, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Che Jigui had violated Article 56 and Article 353, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and Guo Ruimao had violated Article 349, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law.

In February of this year, Qin lost his job and went to Hong Kong to do business with his father-in-law. Li Qihua also temporarily lived in her mother's house.

<h3>Murder on the Mariag - A Corpse Discovered in a Wardrobe - Cafe Owner Dies at Sea - $8,000 USD Vanishes</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A Westerner, C. H. Heilmeir, partnered with someone a few years ago to open the "Yankee Coffee" cafe in the Hongkou District of this city. Business was not bad, and he had some savings. In April of this year, Heilmeir suddenly became tired of life in Shanghai and planned to seek development in the New World. At that time, the cargo ship Mariag happened to be returning to the United States from Shanghai. Heilmeir knew several sailors on the ship and negotiated to act as a "yellow fish" (smuggled passenger), hiding on the ship to go to the United States. Therefore, Heilmeir sold his shares in the cafe to others for $8,000 USD and packed his bags to board the ship.</p>
<p>The Mariag is a cargo ship. Not long after it set sail, Heilmeir's body was shockingly discovered in a wardrobe. The $8,000 USD he obtained from selling his cafe shares had vanished. After the body was discovered on the ship, the sailors all claimed not to know him, and Heilmeir's body was immediately buried at sea in the ocean.</p>
<p>The matter came to the attention of the Canadian Police Department. When the Mariag arrived in Montreal on the 17th of this month, six sailors suspected of being involved were arrested. Under interrogation, two of them admitted to hiding Heilmeir on the ship as a "yellow fish," but they firmly denied the murder.</p>
<p>The case is currently under investigation, and how Heilmeir died is still a mystery. However, it is known that the temperature in the wardrobe where Heilmeir was hiding was above 180 degrees, so Heilmeir's death may have been caused by suffocation from the heat.</p>
<h3>The Name is Famous, but the Person is Not the Same - How Many Wu Guozhens Are There?</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wu Guozhen, the Mayor of Shanghai, is a name that everyone is familiar with.</p>
<p>However, very few people have noticed that there are another fourteen people with the same name as Mayor Wu. Although these people may be easily overlooked among the common people, they are quite interesting in their diverse forms.</p>
<p>Recently, the China Electric Power Plant No. 1 (CPEP No. 1) took a liking to this subject and captured these fifteen Wu Guozhens in the "Window of Shanghai" film, which will soon be released simultaneously with "Youth by the River."</p>
<p>When the photographers from CPEP No. 1, led by photographer Zhang Hongkang, were photographing the various Wu Guozhens, they went to great lengths. Some of the Wu Guozhens, because they did not understand the truth of filming a movie, hid away. Some were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they were at a loss. Some even saw the photographer holding a "strange thing" in one hand and an ID card in the other, thinking that they were coming to "arrest people," and were so scared that they refused to admit their identity. Finally, after several explanations, the matter was resolved satisfactorily. However, by the time the photographers achieved their goal, they were exhausted and their lips were parched.</p>
<p>Among these fifteen Wu Guozhens, two have now left Shanghai. One is a 31-year-old garment worker (see photo 13), who lived at No. 18 Wengjia Branch Lane in the Nanshi District. He recently won a lottery at his boss's place, took the money, and fled to his hometown of Changzhou. His boss is jumping mad about this!</p>
<p>One is from Yancheng, Jiangsu (see photo 14), 36 years old, who only recently settled in Shanghai in October of the year before last. He filled out "Jiangsu Provincial Government Employee" in the household registration form. But now he has gone to Taiwan to do business. He is also the only one among the other fourteen Wu Guozhens who has received a university education.</p>
<p>There is also a Wu Guozhen here (see photo 5) who used to have a bit of a "history." He was summoned by the District Court on February 21 of this year because he had borrowed 700,000 yuan from a man named Lu Zhihai on November 2 and December 15 of last year, and was later sued by Lu for failing to repay the debt on time. At the time, he claimed in court that he was still a boss, running the "Ruyi Restaurant Tiger Stove" at No. 271 Hanyang Road in Hongkou. Apparently, things didn't go too "ruyi" (as one wishes) later on. He has now changed careers and set up a noodle stall at the intersection of Huade Road and East Han County Luli. Although it's a small business, it's doing quite well. He is from Gaoyou, Jiangsu, 38 years old, and has lived in Shanghai for eight years.</p>
<p>Wu Guozhen (see photo 11), who was once so frightened that his face turned pale because he did not understand the truth of filming, works as a partner in the Yang Zhenghe [missing character] store at No. 976 Dongyou Road. He is 25 years old, from Tongzhou, Jiangsu, and has been in Shanghai for three years.</p>
<p>Wu Guozhen (see photo 8), who lives at No. 537 Shundao Road, used to be a police officer, but now he has switched to being a street vendor, selling imported sundries and seasonal fans at No. 288 Huaian Road. He is from Yancheng, Jiangsu, only 21 years old this year. Since "throwing away the gun and going into business," it is said that he has a good "business sense" and is making a decent living!</p>
<p>Wu Guozhen (see photo 2), who is still studying at Shuji Elementary School, is from Yuyao, Zhejiang, 15 years old, has been in Shanghai for eight years, and lives with his family, Wu Chengde, in Room 16 on the 7th floor of the Riverside Apartment. When they went to his home to take a picture, Wu Guozhen had just gone out to buy soy sauce. For a moment, his mother saw many strangers coming to his house looking for Wu Guozhen and thought that Wu Guozhen had gotten into trouble outside. She was so anxious that she asked what was going on first. After explaining their intention, she was relieved. While they were talking, Wu Guozhen also jumped in happily with a bottle of soy sauce.</p>
<p>There is also a Wu Guozhen (see photo 12) who works as a technician at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, 22 years old, from Yancheng. It took a lot of trouble to take his picture. First, the trade union held a meeting to discuss and approve it, then they sought his consent, and finally, after the approval of the factory director and manager, he officially went on camera.</p>
<p>There is also a shop assistant Wu Guozhen (see photo 3), 17 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, who has been in Shanghai for three years. He is currently an employee of the Tangsheng Leather Shoe Company at No. 733 Nanjing West Road, dealing with the ladies who come to buy shoes all day long. Look! Isn't he holding a ladies' white leather shoe in his hand, smiling and talking about business?</p>
<p>In the Rongchang Cloth Factory on Xiepo Tulu and Houli No. 6, a worker Wu Guozhen (see photo 6), is combing cotton yarn by semi-manual and semi-mechanical means, a 33-year-old man.</p>
<p>There is also a small vendor Wu Guozhen (see photo 7), who lives at No. 2 Xirenmei Lane, Guangxi Road, from Chaoyang, Guangdong, 18 years old. He is carefully looking at the ledger by the wall, wondering if business will be good today.</p>
<p>Finally, on the street, we met another Chen Guozhen (see photo 4), selling sesame seed cakes, smiling happily, probably doing well in business. He is 17 years old this year, studied for three years of elementary school, lives in the house opposite No. 1, Sanhe Lane on the road, from Huaiyin, Jiangsu, and has also been in Shanghai for seven years.</p>
<p>Here, there is also one (see photo 1), he is from Jianshi, Hubei, 45 years old, graduated from Tsinghua University in Peiping, Bachelor of Arts from Grinnell College, USA, PhD from Princeton University. He lives at No. 201 Anfu Road and works at No. 209 Jiangxi Road every day. This is the current Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen.</p>
<p>Among the remaining seven, the owner of the leather goods store at No. 165 Daming Road (see photo 10) is the relatively wealthy one. He is originally from Shang[missing character] County and is 38 years old this year.</p>
<p>Two are "friends of the office." One is an accountant at Room 409, No. 1454 East Zhongzheng Road (see photo 9), 39 years old, from Shanghai. Looking at him in a suit and leather shoes, with a cigarette in one hand and an abacus in the other, you can tell that he is a very shrewd person. One is an employee of the American Asia Insurance Company (see photo 15), coincidentally also 39 years old, from Shanghai, but a good hand at the typewriter.</p>
<p>CPEP No. 1 went to great lengths to take pictures, going to the point of exhaustion, and many jokes were made.</p>
<h3>There Are Also Many Who Share Names With Huang Jinrong and Li Lihua</h3>
<p>Among the citizens of Shanghai, in addition to the fifteen Wu Guozhens, there are also ten people with the same name as Huang Jinrong, including two carpenters, one cobbler, two dock workers, two merchants, and two workers at a tiger stove. There are also as many as ten people with the same name as the movie star Li Lihua, including a manicurist, a midwife, a dancer, and several domestic workers. This statistical work was carried out by the Household Registration Section of the Police Department using the portrait number analysis method. It only took ten minutes to retrieve the paper cards for the above two people.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Study Abroad Has Been Resolved - The US Consulate General Has Agreed to Issue Visas - Procedures for Going Abroad Can Be Handled at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 18th] The issue of foreign exchange settlement and the amount of US dollars for self-funded students studying abroad has been delayed for a long time. It was temporarily decided to settle foreign exchange for 900 US dollars for going abroad, but the US Consul General in Shanghai believed that this amount was insufficient for two years of use and could not agree to issue a visa. Recently, the Bank of China has obtained the consent of the United States to allow self-funded students to temporarily buy 900 US dollars in foreign exchange for going abroad. If it is not enough in the future, they can apply to continue to purchase US exchange to make up the difference. The US Consul General in Shanghai has agreed to issue visas, and self-funded students can handle procedures for going abroad at any time.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Spokesperson Refutes the Claim of Mass Dismissals of Professors</h3>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 18th] Recently, there have been frequent rumors that the education authorities intend to dismiss a large number of professors from various schools, and the rumors are rife. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Education stated that the appointment of professors in various schools has always been handled by the school authorities with full authority, and the Ministry has never interfered, in order to maintain academic freedom and respect the status of professors. However, professor appointments have a fixed term, so at the end of the appointment period, the school authorities decide whether to renew the appointment.

<h3>The Employment Problem for Graduates in Beiping is Serious - More Than Two-Thirds are Unemployed</h3>
<p>[Report from China News Agency in Beiping on the 18th] The problem of finding employment for graduates of universities and colleges in Peiping is very serious. Engineering students have several job options to choose from, while liberal arts students have trouble finding even one job. Most institutions refuse to employ women.

Half of the 110 people seeking employment at Yanjing University have already found solutions. All 240 graduates of Beiyang [missing character] of Peiping can find employment, and one-fifth have already left school for work.

<h3>Severe Book Famine in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Report from Dihua News Agency] Previously, when the military situation in the Northeast was tense, various universities withdrew one after another. The major bookstores in this city that had established branches in Shenyang and Changchun, including Commercial Press, China Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, Dadong Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Wenhua Publishing House, and Duli Publishing House, found it difficult to withdraw, and it had too great an impact on local education and cultural undertakings, so they continued to operate as before. However, business was extremely sluggish due to the impact of the war, especially in Sipingjie and Andong, where the losses of books and accounts were even greater. Recently, although the Northeast [missing characters] and the printing industry have discussed printing textbooks, it has not become a reality due to the shortage of paper and high costs. Although the promotion of printing national textbooks by the newly established publishing industry in this city is strong, the funds are short, the number of copies printed is very small, and they dare not risk transporting them to the Northeast for supply. As for Commercial Press, China Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, etc., due to transportation difficulties and the fact that they have not negotiated properly with the local government, they do not know the actual quantity needed and how to supply it, which is under consideration. Therefore, the shortage of books in the Northeast is quite serious.</p>

When reporters inquired about this, Mr. Hang only stated: "This trip is for research-style discussions with relevant personnel on various educational issues." He did not acknowledge the rumor that the Ministry of Education had instructed various schools not to re-employ certain professors. Mr. Hang mostly remained silent regarding the various questions posed by reporters. According to reliable sources, the letters of appointment for professors at Fudan University, Jiaotong University, and other schools for the next semester have not yet been issued, causing anxiety among the professors. Vice Minister Hang's trip to Shanghai, accompanied by Chen Dongyuan, Supervisor of the Ministry of Education, may lead to a final decision.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Library: Buildings in Two Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jinan University Library has buildings in two locations. One is located on East Tiyu Road, serving as the Science and Engineering College Library. In addition to specializing in books on science and business, it recently received 30,000 volumes of enemy and puppet books allocated by the Ministry of Education to compensate for wartime losses.

<h3>Principal Yuan Dunli of Beiping Normal College Discusses the Crisis in National Education</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 18th dispatch] Yuan Dunli, President of Beiping Normal College, who attended the education seminar, recently told reporters: "Today's national education is facing a serious crisis. According to statistics, there are fewer than 50,000 qualified teachers nationwide, which is the result of a large number of qualified teachers changing professions. Currently, national primary school teachers earn only 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per month, which is less than a university student's scholarship and only equivalent to the income of a laborer in an ordinary government agency. The central government has designated national education funding to be the responsibility of local governments, but local governments cannot afford it. For example, Zhejiang Province should spend 46 billion yuan on national education, but its entire budget is only 40 billion yuan, which is insufficient even if it is all allocated to education. However, we believe that while higher education should be strengthened, national education should be saved even more. If a country does not have good national education, how can it have good citizens?"</p>

<h3>Dong Shouyi Issues a Statement Denying Requesting That the World Games Be Held</h3>
<p>Dong Shouyi, Secretary-General of the National Sports Association, who attended the International Olympic Committee meeting, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong by plane a few days ago. Yesterday, Dong issued the following statement to a reporter from Guoguang News Agency regarding the trip and his impressions:</p>
<p>I went to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, a month ago to attend the International Olympic Committee meeting. I had met with Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Association, several times beforehand. Because the matter was international, I decided to attend. The other Chinese members of the committee, Wang Zhengting and Kong Xiangxi, were unable to attend due to busy schedules, so I went alone. The meeting lasted for four days. The main task was to approve the location for the 1952 World Games and to determine amateur qualifications. Various countries competed fiercely to host the Games, and they brought a large number of printed materials, photos, and films for publicity. The mayor of Los Angeles personally attended the meeting and delivered a moving speech. European countries were not to be outdone. As a result, Finland won the right to host the 1952 World Games with 15 votes. As for the rumor that I requested that the 1956 World Games be held in Peiping, China, it is completely untrue. Judging from the situation of the competition among the above-mentioned countries, it is clear that it is not something that I alone could propose rashly. After the meeting, I went to England to discuss accommodation and other matters for China's participation in next year's World Games. I stayed for two weeks and then returned to China. It is said that Dong is scheduled to host a reception for the sports press in this city in the next few days to report the details, and the Municipal Sports Association will also hold a tea party to welcome Dong.</p>

However, due to various reasons, the location was initially decided to be the Municipal Hongkou Swimming Pool, but later changed to the French Chamber of Commerce. However, it was reliably learned yesterday that the French Chamber of Commerce was unwilling to assist in the competition. Therefore, the Lizhi Society has entrusted Mayor Wu to negotiate with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. If there is still no satisfactory resolution, it will be decided to hold the competition at the Racecourse Swimming Pool.</p>

<h3>Silk and Cloth Association Plans Temporary Measures Again to Simplify Cotton Yarn Distribution Procedures</h3>
<p>Advance Orders Can Be Used to Redeem Stack Receipts and Obtain Payments</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Silk and Cloth Association is holding a temporary joint distribution of cotton yarn, originally scheduled for national and private yarn factories to provide 10,000 bales of cotton yarn each by the 15th of this month to participate in the distribution. Now, because the private factories' cotton yarn has not been delivered in time, the association has consulted with the Six District Cotton Spinning Association to formulate temporary measures to reduce time and simplify procedures, as follows: (1) The joint distribution of cotton yarn will be settled at a negotiated price of 8.8 million yuan per bale for 20-count cotton yarn. (2) Factories that have submitted advance orders but have not yet been allocated yarn can issue stack receipts. The stack receipts can be used to redeem the advance orders from the Silk and Cloth Association according to the number of advance orders and obtain payment to avoid delays. (3) Factories that have been approved for yarn allocation but have not yet submitted advance orders must submit stack receipts (one for each bale) to the Silk and Cloth Association next Monday (the 21st) to obtain payment and do not need to submit advance orders to avoid detours. This does not apply to those who have already submitted advance orders.</p>
<h3>Travelers Carrying National Currency to Guangzhou Are Limited to 500,000 Yuan, Amounts Exceeding This Must Pay a Security Deposit of Equivalent Value, Which Can Be Returned After Presenting a Certificate from the Guangdong Customs</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Jianghai Customs has new regulations regarding the export of national currency. The public announcement issued yesterday is as follows: It has been found that travelers traveling from various parts of the country to Hong Kong or other regions outside the country are not allowed to carry more than 500,000 yuan of domestic currency per person unless they have a passport issued by the Ministry of Finance. This was announced on April 16th of this year in Announcement No. 128. With the approval of the government, travelers flying from Shanghai to Guangzhou who carry more than 500,000 yuan of cash without a passport issued by the Ministry of Finance must pay a security deposit to the customs equal to the value of the banknotes they are transporting and obtain a permit before being allowed to pass. The security deposit will be returned in full by this customs upon presentation of a certificate issued by the Guangdong Customs verifying that the banknotes have arrived in Guangzhou. If the banknotes are not fully transported to Guangzhou, or if the original packaging sealed by this customs is found to have been tampered with, or if the certificate from the Guangdong Customs is not presented within fourteen days after the plane leaves Shanghai, the security deposit will be confiscated, and the security deposit receipt held by the traveler will be invalidated. For detailed reporting procedures, please inquire at the General Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department of this customs. Furthermore, travelers leaving Shanghai to travel to various parts of the country, whether traveling by boat, train, or plane, except for those who need to pass through Hong Kong or other foreign regions, or those who fly from Shanghai to Guangzhou as mentioned above, or those who take civilian ships or boats that do not operate according to ordinary shipping regulations to neighboring foreign ports or regions, there is currently no limit to the amount of domestic currency they can carry.</p>
<h3>Fluctuating Stock Prices on Chinese Stocks Conclude with Slight Firmness</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday were mediocre and fluctuating, generally following the lead of American-Asian stocks. Retail investor sentiment appeared weak, with significant short selling. Around noon, support came from an easing of credit. Major players like numbers 23, 237, and others showed increased buying interest, and American-Asian stocks rebounded after an initial dip. Some active traders abandoned Sino-French and shifted to American-Asian stocks. Towards the close, there was a clear trend towards firmness. New-Kwong and King-Fook were also actively bought by number 204 at the opening, and prices were easily pushed up at the noon close. Unfortunately, due to the overall market trend, they became unusually weak mid-session.</p>
<p>The morning opened steadily. After American-Asian opened, numbers 160, 19, 110, and 218 bought, slightly raising American-Asian to 585 yuan. Numbers 224, 14, 152, and 180 sold, dropping the price to 575 yuan. Simultaneously, Sino-French was sold by numbers 231, 71, 32, and 85, reaching 3710 yuan. Immediate Sino-French was quiet with no transactions. Numbers 97, 226, and 85 pulled American-Asian up to 583 yuan. Number 219 and others also bought Sino-French, bringing it back up to 3770 yuan. Numbers 165, 186, and 180 sold, and number 91 sold after buying, causing American-Asian to fall to 569 yuan. Numbers 223 and 218 tried to push it up by ten yuan, but numbers 102, 69, 152, 223, 91, and 236 sold heavily. Numbers 185 and 76 bought and sold intermittently, resulting in a hesitant and still weak market. At 10:50 AM, numbers 24, 142, 89, and 103 heavily sold, pushing American-Asian down to 560 yuan. Numbers 183, 134, 97, 84, and 24 also unloaded Sino-French, causing it to fall to 3530 yuan. At this point, the market was most fearful and weak, with New-Kwong and King-Fook also seeing low prices. Numbers 14, 180, 152, and retail investors bought, and at 11:20 AM, the price recovered to 573 yuan before slightly consolidating. Subsequently, news of easing credit spread. Numbers 160, 65, 23, 12, 226, 237, and 167 bought aggressively, raising American-Asian to 580 yuan. Current American-Asian reached a high price of 567 yuan, with a difference of over ten yuan. Number 125, Kin-Cheng Bank, and others continued to arbitrage selling. Number 61 and others also closed positions, causing a slight dip. Sino-French was bought by numbers 22, 110, 157, 224, 4, 84, and 185, rising to around 3690 yuan. At this point, most active traders abandoned Sino-French and moved to American-Asian. Therefore, American-Asian was extremely stable towards the close, while Sino-French was significantly weak. After the close, the asking price for American-Asian remained firm. The result was that, compared to the previous close, immediate Sino-French shares were slightly lower, while American-Asian and China-Wool each rose by a little less than half a percent. Yung-Kong rose by one percent, New-Kwong and New-China remained flat, Sino-French and New-Asia were slightly down, King-Fook and Keen-Hing were slightly up, and Matches and Cement rose by a little more than half a percent. Lee-An and Five-Peace were flat, and the rest only rose slightly. For deferred shares, Sino-French was slightly down, Yung-Kong rose by half a percent, American-Asian, China-Wool, Keen-Hing, and King-Fook rose slightly, and other old shares were flat and weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yung-Kong yarn futures outside the market rose from 10,000 yuan to close at 10,030 yuan. New shares opened at 210 yuan, fell to 197 yuan, and then closed at prices of 210 yuan and 213 yuan. Interest prices were 2 jiao 1 and 2 jiao 5 and a half.</p>
<h3>Weakness in Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with relatively firm footing. Later, due to the opening of Spinning and Construction yarn, activity was mediocre. Additionally, the credit situation among fellow traders remained tight in some areas, and sporadic selling continued in the market. Prices were unable to hold and declined. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fell by 500,000 yuan from the previous day, to 17,770,000 yuan. Special Double Horse also fell by 200,000, to 11,600,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn fell slightly by 100,000, to 10,070,000 yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns such as 40-count, 32-count, 20-count, 16-count, and Brightness all fell slightly, ranging from 22,000 to 90,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Continues to Strengthen</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened flat and weak. Subsequently, due to activity by Hankou merchants and renewed buying interest from outside the industry, prices were pushed up. As a result, the closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 10,000 yuan from the previous day, to 438,000 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings Color Ball, Blue Phoenix, and Sunshine Crane also rose by 5,000 to 8,000 yuan. Hankou merchants' purchases of colored cloth and Four Gentlemen serge were transacted at 485,000 yuan, an increase of over 10,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, twill, and blue drill cloth were also relatively stable.</p>
<p>Spinning and Construction Yarn Allocation</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, China Spinning and Construction Company, as usual, jointly allocated yarn on behalf of the Spinning and Adjustment Association, allocating a total of 967 pieces, all allocated to the replication industry. A total of 446 applicants were reported.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds rose but could not sustain the gains. Toward the close, they were forced lower by profit-taking. Category C opened at 7,500, with the high price nearly approaching the 8,000 yuan mark, but then fell back to close near the 7,000 yuan level. Numbers 360 and 555 bought, while numbers 538 and 552 sold, with approximately 1 million yuan in transactions. Compared to the previous close, Categories A and B fell slightly by 200 yuan, Category C fell by 400 yuan, Category D fell by 100 yuan, and only Category E remained flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were stimulated by outside-industry interest and rebounded again. Guangdong merchants and Jewish traders bought aggressively. Securities firms observed, while Northern merchants and money changers sold. Ewo Cotton was raised from 68,000 to close at 74,000. Rubber stocks were slightly weak. British American Tobacco rose most strongly. As a result, compared to the previous close, British American Tobacco alone rose by over ten percent, and other stocks each rose by a little more than half a percent.</p>
<h3>Credit Conditions Have Eased – National Banks and Bureaus Issue 61.3 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the results of the clearing at the local clearinghouse showed that the four banks and two bureaus had a net outflow of 61.3 billion yuan, with the Central Bank alone accounting for 27 billion yuan. In addition, foreign banks had a net inflow of 17.6 billion yuan, exchange houses before number 50 had a net inflow of 37 billion yuan, and those after number 50 had a net inflow of 6.7 billion yuan. Credit conditions have eased, with dark interest rates at 1 jiao 8 fen to 2 jiao. It is reported that the main reason for the large outflow from national banks and bureaus yesterday was that after the suspension of trading in Yong-Kong yarn in Chinese stocks, trading volume in the stock exchange market decreased. Additionally, due to Friday's settlement, arbitrage trading also decreased significantly, so the 50% margin deposits were also withdrawn, resulting in the large outflow from national banks and bureaus. Furthermore, after the National Bank strictly prevented the arbitrage trading between Shanghai and South China recently, and with the new regulations announced by the Jianghai Customs regarding the export of national currency to other ports, the trend of arbitrage has been curbed, which also reduces the outflow of cash from the city.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank Accepts Pawned Tea - Tea Merchants Seek to Promote Sales Abroad</h3>
<p>Selling Price May Exceed Government Purchase Price</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is still preparing for the purchase of tea. The purchase period was originally scheduled to end on the 20th, but the Joint Treasury considered the difficulties of tea merchants and decided to extend the deadline by five days. To date, the Central Trust Bureau has not received any applications from tea merchants. It is understood that tea merchants are demanding a price that is 50% higher than the new price agreed upon in May. The national banks and bureaus believe that merchants already have a legitimate profit and cannot raise the price further. Therefore, tea merchants are independently seeking to promote exports. They have reached an agreement with the French company Yongxing Foreign Firm to sell 80% of the stored green tea. An agreement has been reached, and progress is also being made with ordinary green tea. The average selling price can be as high as US$1.40 per kilogram, exceeding the government purchase price. Therefore, they are not interested in the government's purchase. Tea merchants are actively raising funds to redeem the tea pawned to the Agricultural Bank.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Tea Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw sluggish sales of various domestic teas. Apart from continuous purchases by local shops and merchants, sales in areas such as Fengjing, Songjiang, Suzhou, and Wuxi remained stagnant due to continuous rain. However, industry insiders say that sales are expected to increase sharply once the weather clears. As for various export green teas such as Chun Zhen and Zhen Mei, sellers are maintaining a firm stance due to the relatively low inventory in the market. Although buying interest remains strong, transactions are still weak, and the market remains unchanged. As for other varieties, only Chen's coarse black tea is being sought by Wuchang Tea Company, and prices are also very firm.</p>
<h3>Rice Supply Exceeds Demand - Minimal Fluctuations in Japonica and Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 4,700 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market was flat and firm in the morning, but weakened in the afternoon. Both Japonica and Indica rice saw minimal fluctuations, and the market lacked the strength to rise. White Yuan Zhong and Second Grade remained sluggish. Meanwhile, rice prices in Hankou fell sharply, and the supply of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in Wuxi was exceptionally strong, breaking the highest record. Warehouses were already full, so the grain situation remains prosperous for the time being.</p>
<p>Due to limited production from factories and wheat still en route, flour prices fluctuated slightly. Factory flour, unified flour, and mixed brand flour all saw slight increases of around 1,000 yuan. Bran sales remained sluggish, falling by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales in rural areas increased, rising slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while Yingkou cake rose by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean sales remained weak, with supply still coming from the Yangtze River region and some from the Northeast. Prices continued to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean sales were unsatisfactory, falling by another 10,000 yuan. Red beans were weak, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was scarce in both supply and demand, and the market was mediocre. Corn supply exceeded demand, and the market was stable. After continuous declines, raw peanuts saw increased sales, rebounding by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame supply was slightly higher, with few buyers, and prices plummeted by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Broad beans continued to flood the market with slow sales, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Garden peas were stable, and wheat was flat.</p>
<p>The oil market continued to see mixed ups and downs. Raw soybean oil remained popular, rebounding by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil sales were sluggish, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, forming a contrasting trend.</p>
<p>Longan Falls Steadily</p>
<p>Longan sales have been sluggish recently, and the market had risen too much previously. Recent declines have also been significant, with prices falling steadily by a little less than 30% in recent days, and few buyers.</p>
<h3>Four District Silk Weaving Industry Association Applies for Increased Production Loan Amount</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Production loans for the silk weaving industry in this city have been approved by the Joint Treasury, with a principle of 5 million yuan per loom, a term of three months, and an interest rate of five percent. The Four District Silk Weaving Industry Association believes that the loan amount is insufficient and convened a board meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday to discuss the matter. It was decided to submit another letter to the Joint Treasury, requesting that the loan amount per loom be increased to 15 million yuan. There were two other proposals: (1) Request the Central Trust Bureau not to adopt the auction method for rayon and to continue to allocate it. (2) The association is currently soliciting opinions from its members on the rayon quota allocated by the Transportation Control Committee, and the allocation will be made after the opinions have been collected.</p>
<h3>Sericulture Production and Sales Guidance Association to Hold Twelfth Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Sericulture Production and Sales Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will hold its twelfth committee meeting at 10:00 AM today (the 19th). It is understood that in addition to deciding on the date for autumn silkworm egg acid treatment, the meeting will also discuss the request from the Third District Silk Reeling Industry Union to issue 10% of the loan funds and 10% of the profits in raw silk or to pay only 80% in kind to repay the entire loan. This proposal is expected to spark heated debate. According to the original principles of silkworm cocoon loans, manufacturers who received loans should reel raw silk, which should be purchased by the government. However, the current market is experiencing a shortage of raw materials, and maintaining domestic sales is also an urgent task. The association may adopt a compromise solution when making a decision.</p>
<h3>Rayon from Barter Trade with Japan Expected to Arrive Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the Central Trust Bureau, (1) the rayon handled by the bureau under the barter trade with Japan will be shipped in batches in this month and the next two months (August and September). Therefore, the allocation volume is expected to be more abundant than before. The allocation method remains the same, but the matter of adjusting the allocation price will be decided after Director Wu returns to Shanghai. A general outline is expected by next Monday.</p>
<p>Suspension of Hog Bristle Purchase</p>
<p>(2) Since the bureau started purchasing tung oil and hog bristles, the purchase volume of tung oil has been quite large. Some hog bristles have already been purchased, but the purchase has been temporarily suspended due to the revision of the purchase price.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate Officially Announced to End</h3>
<p>Last year, the Central Bank launched military discount and re-mortgage loans to support small-scale industrial production and export trade. The China Communications Bank and other three banks and two bureaus jointly formed an industrial and commercial loan syndicate with commercial banks and money shops. A total of 9.9599 billion yuan was lent out. Loan units in the cotton spinning industry totaled 418. This year, after the establishment of the discount committee by the National Bank in April, the syndicate's business was transferred. All loans of the syndicate were fully recovered and settled by the 7th of this month. The Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate was officially announced to end this week.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market remained weak, with few transactions. Buyers were hesitant due to the continued decline in cotton yarn prices and mostly observed. Yarn mills in the local market offered low prices, causing sellers to be unwilling to sell cheaply. Therefore, trading became sluggish. However, after the market had stopped rising and started to fall in the past two days, the market has stabilized yesterday. The factory delivery price for each grade was: Tongzhou 1.84 million, and the warehouse delivery price was: Shandong Binzhou 2.12 million, 2.15 million to 2.17 million, Shashi 2.04 million, Hankou fine velvet 1.90 million, 1.95 million to 2.03 million, Guide 1.92 million, US Middling 2.05 million, Pudong Fire Machine 1.70 million, Zhoupu Seed Cotton 325,000 per load.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Transactions Become Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw few arrivals due to continuous rain. Sales were quite brisk. Subsequently, the market atmosphere stabilized as door-to-door shops saw good retail sales. The number of people in the market was higher in the afternoon, and traders bought in low, leading to more active transactions and rising prices. The final price of 10-pack British American Tobacco cigarettes rose by 140,000 yuan from the previous day, to 8.92 million yuan. Old Knife Brand was 7.65 million, also up 100,000. Five-Flower was 6.85 million, up 60,000 to 70,000.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, there was a lot of buying for higher-grade cigarettes. Three-Cannon was 69,500 yuan, Da-Nan-Men was 82,000 yuan, and Shang-Za-Bu was also bought. Other Chinese brand cigarettes such as Mei-Li-Jin-Yuan, Bai-Lan-Di-Ke-Lei-Si, Red-Jin-Cross, and other brand strip cigarettes were actively sold in the afternoon, with prices rising from 500 yuan to 2,500 yuan. American Camel, Six-Root Horsepower, and other strip cigarettes and canned cigarettes remained popular, but with constant arrivals from abroad, some were being sold off at a loss, leading to lower prices.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Opening Trade with Japan, Industry and Commerce Advocate Adopting a Chain System</h3>
<p>After the Allied Headquarters decided to open private trade with Japan in mid-next month, restoring trade between China and Japan, the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors have paid great attention to it. It is generally agreed that the National Government needs to import materials, and there are major imports and exports. Moreover, the Japanese side declared that it would obtain US$50 million in trade from our country from mid-next month to the end of this year. At a time when our country's industry and commerce are declining and costs are high, it is difficult to compete with it. Therefore, some people advocate implementing a chain system to exchange materials exported to Japan for industrial raw materials and rayon needed domestically. Others advocate adopting a subsidy system, but most industrial and commercial figures believe that adopting a chain system is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Wu Yun-Chu Advocates Strict Control</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Wu Yun-Chu, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, expressed his opinion on the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade yesterday, believing that under the current circumstances, restoring Sino-Japanese trade is not only useless to the development of our country's industry, but also harmful. Because the price of Japanese goods must be cheaper than our country's goods, the import of Japanese goods will seriously hit our national industry. Therefore, he advocates that the government should consider slowing down the opening of Sino-Japanese trade. He also stated that if the government decides to open it on schedule, it must strictly control the import of Japanese goods to ensure that our country's industrial production does not suffer losses. He also advocates that future Sino-Japanese trade should be operated by the country, with profits going to the public, to avoid manipulation and monopoly by wealthy merchants. He said that the Industrial Association will hold a meeting next Thursday to discuss the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese trade, and will provide the government with opinions after the meeting.</p>
<p>Some Commodities Can be Sold to Japan</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to Shou Jing-Wei, Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce, the selection method for the business delegation to Japan is still being studied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the announcement is pending. In principle, one representative may be produced for each type of commodity. As for how many commodities our country is suitable for exporting to Japan, it remains to be investigated. What our country hopes to import from Japan is nothing more than machine parts and industrial raw materials. The opposition of the supervisory committee members to the resumption of Japanese private trade is extremely insightful politically; but in economic terms, our country has some commodities that can only be sold in Japan. At the same time, if other countries resume business with Japan while our country adopts a passive attitude alone, it is not a good strategy.</p>
<h3>Banking Association General Assembly Date Determined</h3>
<p>Fifteenth Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Held Yesterday</p>

<h3>Supply and Demand of Cotton in China in the 36th Year of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>— Shi Xin-Quan</p>
<p>China's cotton production reached 13 million dan before the war. After the war, due to food shortages, traffic obstruction, and high production costs, cotton farmers were unwilling to plant cotton, and production declined sharply. In the 34th year of the Republic of China, it decreased to 5 million dan, and in the 35th year, it increased to 7.4 million dan, but it was still far from the pre-war level.</p>
<p>This year's new cotton will soon enter the market. According to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the weather was good during the sowing season in the 36th year, and the cotton fields in various provinces have increased. It is estimated that the cotton field area is 39.04 million mu. If calculated at an average production of 25 jin of lint per mu, this year's cotton production is estimated to reach 9.7 million dan.</p>
<p>| Year   | Cotton Field (Thousands of mu) | Production (Tens of thousands of dan) |</p>
<p>| ------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |</p>
<p>| 26     | 59,316                         | 12,720                               |</p>
<p>| 34     | 22,796                         | 5,000                                |</p>
<p>| 35     | 29,418                         | 7,430                                |</p>
<p>| 36     | 39,040                         | 9,740                                |</p>
<p>There has been no significant change in spindle equipment in recent years. There are a total of 4.5 million spindles in the country, but due to insufficient power and lack of parts, they have not been fully operational. The current average operating rate is about 80%, which is 3.6 million spindles in operation.</p>
<p>Taking the production of 20-count yarn as an example, each spindle needs 1 pound of cotton per day when it operates for 20 hours, and it works for 26 days per month. Each spindle needs 26 pounds of raw cotton, and 312 pounds per year. 3.6 million spindles need 1,123.2 million pounds, equivalent to 10.21 million dan, which is 2.268 million bales of cotton.</p>
<p>The estimated cotton production in the 35th year was 9.7 million dan. However, the national annual demand for cotton wool and cotton clothing, as well as the sales of the hand-woven textile industry, is 2.25 million dan. The cotton used by the hand-woven cotton textile industry is about 2.5 million dan. The demand for cotton from both sources is 4.75 million dan. The cotton stored by cotton farmers is about 550,000 dan. Therefore, the cotton available to the textile industry this year is about 4.4 million dan, which is 997,000 bales.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the total cotton inventory in ten provinces, including Hebei and Hubei, is 1.14 million dan. Adding 640,000 dan in Shanghai, the total is 1.78 million dan, equivalent to 390,000 bales.</p>
<p>| Province | Thousands of dan |</p>
<p>| -------- | ---------------- |</p>
<p>| Shanghai | 640              |</p>
<p>| Hebei   | 229              |</p>
<p>| Shandong | 143              |</p>
<p>| Henan   | 120              |</p>
<p>| Jiangxi  | 5                |</p>
<p>| Shaanxi | 150              |</p>
<p>| Hubei   | 258              |</p>
<p>| Hunan   | 22               |</p>
<p>| Anhui   | 24               |</p>
<p>| Zhejiang | 23               |</p>
<p>| Jiangsu  | 169              |</p>
<p>| Total    | 1,781            |</p>
<p>Note: The cotton inventory in Shanghai is 580,000 dan in factory warehouses and 60,000 dan in foreign warehouses.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, in the 36th year of the cotton calendar, if the national textile industry wants to maintain an 80% operating rate, there will still be a shortage of 4.04 million dan of raw cotton, which is 890,000 bales.</p>
<p>This shortfall will inevitably continue to rely on imports of foreign cotton to supplement. Otherwise, the 3.6 million spindles will not be able to continue operating. To reduce the import of foreign cotton and reduce the consumption of foreign exchange, the only way is to actively increase domestic cotton production and improve the quality of mechanically produced cotton. At a time when senior representatives of the US Cotton Council are on their way to China to investigate the cotton situation, I would like to briefly describe the domestic cotton supply and demand situation in the 36th year of the Republic of China for the reference of relevant parties.</p>
<h3>China Automobile Manufacturing Company: A Lone Struggle with a Bright Future</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Sheng Zhi</p>
<p>(This newspaper's report) China Automobile Manufacturing Company recently borrowed five million US dollars from the United States to purchase a complete set of new automobile manufacturing machinery. This loan has already been guaranteed by our country's highest authorities and will be delivered as soon as the Executive Yuan approves the foreign exchange settlement. If so, our country's automobile manufacturing industry will make further significant contributions.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, we cannot bury the achievements of the industrial sector. Working diligently behind the scenes, they have indeed added considerable strength to the country, both large and small. Recalling the past, on several dilapidated highways in the rear, although only a few "unimpressive" diesel and charcoal vehicles were running on the surface, at their core, they were purely the result of our own hard work. Under the severe conditions of being blockaded at the time, we relied on this "point" to avoid losing the vitality of our major arteries.</p>
<p>Falling Down and Getting Up</p>
<p>Speaking of automobiles, one cannot help but think of the spirit of hard work in the automobile factories at that time. In the turbulent situation of wartime, they repeatedly fell down, but then repeatedly got back up. At that time, the China Automobile Manufacturing Company, which appeared in the rear as a lone struggler, was also one of the hardworking elements in hundreds of departments throughout the country's industrial sector. At that time, everyone may have been blinded by the drivers, the lucky ones of the "motors roaring, gold pouring in" era, and instead overlooked the hardworking staff behind the scenes. At that time, who would have imagined that while the drivers were indulging in pleasure, the engineers were eating simple vegetarian meals in the laboratory!</p>
<p>Moving to Guilin to Manufacture Parts</p>
<p>Speaking of this unique force, the history of China Automobile Manufacturing Company must be told simply from the beginning. Originally, "Zhong Qi" was established as early as the 23rd or 24th year of the Republic, with the factory located in Gaochang Temple in Shanghai. At that time, everyone was full of hope and excitedly preparing, but the "January 28th" battle brought a major blow. Fortunately, they could rely on the protection of the concession at that time, and the machinery was not damaged. However, the progress of the work was considerably hindered as a result. The company felt the pressure from external forces at the time, and in order to seek a permanent solution, it jointly established a "Joint Factory" with the Railway General Machinery Factory in Zhuzhou. When everything was ready and they were preparing to carry out power generation work, the "August 13th" battle unexpectedly broke out in quick succession. Soon, Hankou was in danger, and Zhuzhou was shaken. Therefore, the newly installed machinery was dismantled again and moved to Liangfeng, Guilin, where it barely managed to stand its ground and began manufacturing some parts.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Automobiles in Kowloon</p>
<p>While "Zhong Qi" was fleeing inland, it was still continuously ordering machinery from abroad. In order to obtain convenience in replenishing materials, it established the "Nanhua Ironworks" in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon. In terms of scale, it was already considered one of the leading companies in the domestic automobile industry at that time. Manufacturing engines and automobiles by themselves, it was the first time a brilliant flower was released in the domestic automobile industry.</p>
<p>Factory Bankrupt, Leaving Only an Empty Shell</p>
<p>The country's difficulties severely threatened the industrial sector. When the Pacific War broke out, almost all of the essence that China had left overseas went bankrupt. "Zhong Qi" was certainly no exception. More than 300 pieces of important machinery in the Nanhua Ironworks were looted by the Japanese army. Since then, the "Nanhua Ironworks" existed in name only, almost leaving only an empty shell.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war, the Nanhua Factory already had products. After more than 200 engines and a large number of parts were transported to Chongqing, there were still a large number of parts piled up in the areas of Yangon, Lashio, and Zhefang. However, due to the "one-sided" war at that time, the materials in Huitong could not be evacuated in time, and they were all sacrificed.</p>
<p>Repair Shop in Chongqing</p>
<p>Fortunately, these more than 200 engines were transported to Chongqing in time, which indeed played a significant role in subsequent transportation.</p>
<p>Immediately after the National Army withdrew from Hunan, "Zhong Qi" was left with only the last stronghold in Chongqing. Fortunately, there were still some machines at that time, and work could continue, becoming a major repair shop in the rear.</p>
<p>Chongqing Branch Opens New Path</p>
<p>After the victory, everyone returned to their positions. "Zhong Qi" had a grand plan. In addition to preparing to resume self-made automobiles, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of the present, it transformed the branch factory remaining in Chongqing from heavy industry to light industry, reorganized it into the "Textile Machinery Company," and opened up a new path for the impoverished industrial sector.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Spinning Spindles to Seek Improvement</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the company in Chongqing, it began to manufacture a large number of spinning spindles. Recently, it has customized more than 10,000 spindles for the Shanghai Zhongfang Company, which are expected to be delivered in full next month. After comparing the test results with the Japanese "Sansha Style," the ratio is 82 points to 91 points. The results have reached the standard, and efforts are still being made to continue improving, striving for perfection, and hoping that the second batch of products can compete with imported products, or even surpass them.</p>
<p>At present, many small yarn factories in Chongqing have adopted self-made spindles. Yufeng Yarn Factory is one of them. However, Yufeng's spindles are American-style, and the difference is that American yarn spindles are larger in size, and in terms of flexible application, they are not as good as Japanese-style. (The Japanese style is imitated according to British standards)</p>
<p>Seeking Development in the Southwest</p>
<p>According to the plan of the Textile Machinery Company, future business development will focus entirely on the southwestern provinces. It is hoped that each region will have its own self-made textile factories. However, judging from the current product performance, only making spindles can reach 20,000 to 40,000 spindles per month. If making a complete set of machines, only 20,000 to 30,000 spindles can be made each year, which is just enough for a small-scale yarn factory in the interior.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Engines Benefits Agriculture</p>
<p>In addition, the factory also manufactures some one or two-cylinder engines. In terms of agriculture, milling rice, sawing wood, construction, fire fighting, etc., but because the general farmers' level of knowledge is not high enough at present, it cannot be widely promoted for a while.</p>
<p>A portion of the engines that remained during the war, because a large number of ready-made cars poured in after the victory, almost all lost their effectiveness. Therefore, after further research and improvement, this batch of engines became the engines for transport ships. At that time, many manufacturers who returned east relied on this point of power to solve the transportation difficulties at that time.</p>
<p>Confiscated Items Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Speaking of the "Nanhua Ironworks" stranded in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon, although the machinery was seized by the Japanese, the factory buildings were well preserved. The recently started part of the work is only sand casting and repair. Compared with the scale in the past, there is a feeling of "cannot be mentioned on the same day." However, more than 300 pieces of machinery previously looted by the Japanese army have now been found in Japan, and negotiations are underway with MacArthur's headquarters. It is possible that they will all be returned in the near future.</p>
<p>Engineers Go to the United States</p>
<p>After the victory, "Zhong Qi" sent six engineers to intern in various factories in the United States. At the same time, it borrowed 5 million US dollars from the United States to order the master machine for manufacturing automobiles. However, the condition in the United States is that our government needs to guarantee it. Although it was approved by the highest authorities at that time, due to the need to settle foreign exchange at the official price, it is still placed in the Executive Yuan. If this matter does not have much difficulty, then there may be hope of producing cars next year or the year after.</p>
<p>Shanghai Factory Site Under Consideration</p>
<p>The old factory site in Gaochang Temple in Shanghai is still partly used by the navy. In the future, after this batch of machinery is transported, the issue of the factory site is still a matter that needs to be considered. The factory site in Zhuzhou was not greatly damaged in the war. Based on past experience, setting up a factory in the interior may be safer than in Shanghai. Finally, standing in China's impoverished industrial sector and looking forward to a gratifying future, we feel that the spirit of hard struggle in the past still needs us to persist unremittingly!</p>
<p>While "Zhong Qi" was fleeing inland, it established the "Nanhua Ironworks" in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon, manufacturing automobiles and other items, releasing a unique brilliance in the domestic automobile industry!</p>

<h3>Lingnan University Affiliated Middle School: Student Murders Teacher, Overturning Truth, Previous Confession Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Liang Feng</p>
<p>Principal Resigns to Take Responsibility, Department of Education Handles Strictly</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Air Mail)</p>
<p>Speaking of Guangzhou's most prestigious schools, apart from Sun Yat-sen University, Lingnan University probably has the longest history. For decades, it has cultivated many talents, and they have retained all the excellent teaching spirit of the school. The students in all departments, including the university proper, as well as the affiliated middle school and elementary school, are mostly children from wealthy families. They are well-fed and clothed, and the academic atmosphere has always been the best. They do not cause trouble and do not strike. Although they have the nickname "Lingnan Bulls," they usually behave well, except for sometimes showing a bit of their bull nature on the sports field. Unfortunately, in this peaceful atmosphere, this highly regarded school suddenly experienced a shocking and sensational murder case that shocked the country.</p>
<p>When the incident occurred, the reporter had previously reported the process via telegraph. However, although the incident occurred several weeks ago, and three students have surrendered, the main perpetrator is still at large, so the case has not yet come to an end. Moreover, it is not only a matter of the life and death of individuals, but it is actually related to the entire education system and social atmosphere. Therefore, the reporter will make a detailed report on the inside story of the incident.</p>
<p>Fists Rained Down, Kicks to the Back</p>
<p>The incident occurred on the evening of June 28th. At that time, summer vacation had already begun, and only more than 30 high school students were left in the school to review their coursework in preparation for the graduation exam. Because Cai Huifu was the Dean of Studies of the affiliated middle school and a teacher of the senior three students, he was invited by the students that night to tutor them in chemistry. Mr. Cai was kind and amiable, but he never condoned students and misled their future. Because there were sixty practice questions in the chemistry textbooks of the senior three classes, and a total of one hundred questions in the three books from senior one to senior three A, B, and C, one-fifth of them had not been taught due to the wartime evacuation. Therefore, the students requested that this part be exempted from the exam and the number of practice questions be reduced to forty. However, Mr. Cai believed that this was agreed upon by the school and he could not make the decision personally. At the same time, he sincerely advised them, saying that the graduation exam was just a formality, and even if they graduated in this way, they would still not be able to pass the university entrance exam. He encouraged them to study hard so that they would have a way. Who knew that as soon as he finished speaking, a flute suddenly sounded from the student crowd, and at the same time all the lights went out, and strange noises rang out. Cai immediately rushed out of the classroom, intending to go downstairs and leave. Unexpectedly, in the darkness, fists rained down, and they fought from the third floor to the second floor. In the chaos, he was suddenly kicked in the back, so he could not stand firmly and fell down eight steps from the second floor steel staircase to the platform between floors. The students knew that they had caused trouble, so they quietly dispersed.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive Table Blocking, Planned Conspiracy</p>
<p>At that time, it was about 10:30 pm. The school's electrician discovered that the lights in all the classrooms were off, so he planned to go to the second floor to check the main switch. First, he found that someone had pre-placed a chicken coop-style chair and table used in a classroom at the entrance to the staircase. When he reached the platform between floors, he found Mr. Cai lying diagonally on the ground, so he helped him up. Then, he inspected the switch box and found that the box door had been pried open, and a Boy Scout rope was tied to the main switch, presumably used to pull the switch open at that time. At the same time, next to the electrical box was originally a teacher's dormitory, and at the entrance of the dormitory, someone had also pre-placed a table and chair, looking like they were attempting to prevent people inside from coming out to rescue him. From this, it seems that their humiliation of the teacher was a planned conspiracy!</p>
<p>Instructing Family Not to Announce, Only Saying: "Students Hit Me!"</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's dormitory was less than fifty yards from the scene of the incident, and it would not have taken more than three minutes to arrive, but at that time, Mr. Cai only returned to his residence at twelve o'clock. According to Mrs. Cai, Zhang Biyin, at that time, Mr. Cai was in unbearable pain and vomited all night. He only said, "Students hit me!" and did not mention anything else. He also instructed his family not to announce it to avoid losing the teacher's dignity. The next morning, his injuries worsened, so he was sent to the city by ambulance for treatment, and he died of his injuries at eleven o'clock!</p>
<p>Pregnant Widow, Pitiful Orphans</p>
<p>Mr. Cai was from Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, and was forty-six years old. His family was poor when he was young, and he made a living as a peddler. He studied while working. At that time, Mr. Yao, the pastor of the Baptist Church in his hometown, believed that Cai was intelligent, so he funded him to study at Guangyi Middle School in Hai County. He studied diligently and was always ranked first in every exam. Later, he was funded to go to the Physics Department of Shanghai Hujiang University, where he still studied while working and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree. He then went to the University of the Philippines for further studies and obtained a Master of Physics degree. After returning to China, he served as a teaching assistant in the Physics Department of Shanghai University, the principal of Wuchang Bowen School, and other positions. He taught at Lingnan University Affiliated Middle School from the 27th year of the Republic and was promoted to Dean of Studies due to his excellent performance, which he has held for ten years now. It is unfortunate that he sacrificed himself in this way. His funeral arrangements were desolate, and the situation was extremely tragic. He left behind three sons and one daughter. Mrs. Cai is still pregnant, and we can imagine the extent of Mrs. Cai's grief!</p>
<p>Three Surrendered, Main Perpetrator at Large</p>
<p>Because the incident was a murder case, the police sent people to guard all the students in the class. However, after three days, there were still no clues, and during the custody period, Shen Zhizu (nephew of the traitor Shen Yi), a student in the class, had already absconded. Later, on July 7th, five prosecutors and clerks from the court, along with several inspectors and police officers from the police station, and Mr. Yao, the Director of Education, investigated with all their strength for the whole day, using various methods of persuasion. Director Yao also gave a half-hour speech, encouraging the perpetrators to confess, and saying, "Being brave in admitting mistakes is a behavior that young people should have. Their motives are probably due to a moment of impulse!" Under this persuasion, the students were moved to tears, and Gong Jinzhou, Guan Huiming, and Du Kunye surrendered. Gong confessed to opening the lock of the electrical switch box, Guan confessed to turning off the electrical switch, and Du confessed to hitting Cai with a punch. Liu Shangzhi also surrendered on behalf of Shen Zhizu, confessing that Shen was the main culprit. The court then took the three students back for interrogation, and Liu Shangzhi was instructed to immediately inform Shen Zhizu to quickly surrender to the authorities. The remaining students could regain their freedom that day, but their graduation exams were therefore shelved, waiting for the approval of the Department of Education to be held.</p>
<p>Three Detained Students Retract Previous Confession</p>
<p>The case can be considered to have some clues, but on the 7th, when the court opened a hearing, the three detained students suddenly retracted their previous confessions, only admitting that their initial confession was only out of righteous indignation to avoid the suffering of all the students being detained. So the truth is still worth pondering.</p>
<p>As for the school authorities' handling of the aftermath, the general public here has quite a few criticisms. Because after the secret meeting of the school's board of directors, there is still no definite guarantee for the family of the deceased. As for the students, Li Yinglin, the principal of the school (currently also the Director of the Guangdong Branch of the Executive Yuan), emphasized that the students' crime was a personal problem. However, the family of Du Kunrong, the student who surrendered, said that the student had been boarding at Lingnan University Affiliated Elementary School since the second grade of elementary school. Over the years, he moved with the school. He was indeed nurtured and raised by Lingnan. The school should also be responsible this time. And a certain educator here also said: The occurrence of this incident is actually due to the failure of moral education, and those responsible for moral education in the school should bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>School Principal Resigns to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Therefore, the principal and director of moral education of the school's affiliated middle school have both resigned to take responsibility, but whether they will be approved remains to be decided by the school board of directors.</p>
<p>Indeed, this tragic case is not only an educational problem, but also a very serious social problem. During the years of the War of Resistance, schools moved and relocated, and the students' education greatly declined. Due to the influence of the social atmosphere, moral concepts also declined, and the future feels even more terrifying. Therefore, the Provincial Cultural Association also said in its letter to the Department of Education regarding this case: "This unfortunate tragic case not only violates the Chinese people's respect for teachers and the importance of morality for thousands of years, but also creates a trend of students making trouble and defying superiors. Its impact on the world and people's hearts is no less than that of the Communist Party, which kills, sets fires, and harms people..."</p>
<p>The Department of Education Expresses Strict Handling</p>
<p>As for the Department of Education's handling of the matter, the main points are: (1) Students Shen Zhi and other four, and student representatives Liu Shangzhi and Cen Xiaoxiao, are all expelled from school. The reason for the expulsion of the student representatives is the improper handling after the incident occurred; (2) All students in the class, except those who did not attend class on the night of the incident, will be given a major demerit once; (3) If other students have criminal behavior, the school will investigate and determine the severity of the case separately and give them punishment; (4) The students who have been handed over to the court will be tried separately by the court. And Yao said sternly: The beginning and end of the case have been reported to the Ministry of Education for record. As for his personal expression on this case, he said: "Extremely painful and regretful. This cannot but be said to be a failure of education. We must never condone the criminal students. We must face the ugliness and handle it strictly." And said: "Hope that the educational system will gain opportunity from Mr. Cai's sacrifice."</p>

<h3>Swine Fever Spreads on Taiwan Island</h3>
<p>— Reporter for This Newspaper, Yang Yu</p>
<p>Taipei, 4th (Air Mail)</p>
<p>In late November last year, when the reporter introduced the Danshui Veterinary Vaccine Manufacturing Institute in Taiwan to readers, I remember writing at the end: "Although this institution is costly, its power is worth emphasizing." I hope that the authorities will give strong support. Today, the facts have given me the answer: the entire island is spreading with a terrible swine fever, and the amount of vaccine serum produced by the institute due to limited funds is only one-tenth of the amount needed by various counties. Prevention is impossible beforehand, and treatment is impossible afterward, creating a severe new threat to farmers on the island.</p>
<p>Cattle Plague</p>
<p>Fortunately Did Not Occur</p>
<p>In the past, when farmers in this province encountered swine fever, as long as the plague envoy arrived, the people would habitually lead out all the pigs to receive injections. However, at present, quarantine at the seaports is not thorough, and smuggled pigs bring in germs, which easily infect the island's hybrid pigs with no resistance; political epidemic prevention is unsound, and epidemic prevention administration is as if it is non-existent. In addition, vaccine serum cannot be supplied in large quantities. According to statistics, at least hundreds of thousands of pigs have died from epidemics since the restoration.</p>
<p>Dr. Liu Rongbiao, Associate Professor of National Taiwan University, spent two weeks investigating the veterinary epidemic situation in the entire province: the most terrible cattle plague, which had been extinct for nearly twenty years, fortunately did not occur. Otherwise, more than half of the cattle in Taiwan may have died, affecting rural farming and food production, which would have been unthinkable. Not long ago, the Shanxi Relief Association sent a batch of dairy cows. At that time, they were detained at the Zhu Cuo Lun Ranch outside Taipei for as long as a month and subjected to strict quarantine. As a result, cattle plague and bovine babesiosis were not found, but thirteen of them were infected with the cattle grub disease (Hypodermabovis) that had never been seen in Taiwan Province before. After thorough removal, they have been declared safe.</p>
<p>Slaughterhouses</p>
<p>Major Medium</p>
<p>Among swine epidemics, swine fever, swine plague, and paratyphoid fever are the most rampant, followed by the sporadic spread of swine erysipelas. Most smuggled pigs stay in the coastal areas, and swine epidemics originate from here and gradually invade the interior. Now they are gradually approaching the mountains. These infectious diseases not only bring about the doom of pig extinction, but also can infect the human body to a considerable extent. Farmers secretly slaughtering sick pigs for food or trade further increases the chances of artificial swine disease. According to Dr. Liu's investigation and inspection of four slaughterhouses, he determined that 100% of the slaughtered pigs were infected with swine fever and swine plague. However, there are no inspection regulations at present, nor are there dedicated veterinary doctors to inspect them. Slaughterhouses have become the main medium for infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The death of pigs certainly causes panic about meat food, and it is difficult for farmers to obtain manure fertilizer, but especially the death of breeding sows leads to the hopelessness of future reproduction. Perhaps swine epidemics are ignored in the country because the land is too vast, but on this small island, it has become a major event, and no farmer is not anxious.</p>
<p>Talking About Increasing Production</p>
<p>Thorough Epidemic Prevention</p>
<p>There are countermeasures: strictly implement seaport quarantine to prevent smuggling; urgently allocate a large amount of funds to increase the production of vaccine serum; the first step in epidemic prevention administration starts from the township offices. The solid foundation of Taiwan's food policy in the past was partly due to the thoroughness of livestock epidemic prevention. Now, it is even more urgent to deal with it.</p>
<h3>United Nations Two-Year Work Review (2)</h3>
<p>July 8, Shanghai United Translation</p>
<p>In accordance with the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly in the London Conference, the Economic and Social Council established a subcommittee in February to formulate recommendations for the international institutions necessary for reconstruction. The subcommittee's report indicated that the need for reconstruction was enormous. Last autumn, the General Assembly reviewed this report and recommendation at the New York Conference. On March 27, 1947, the Economic and Social Council established two economic committees for Europe and Asia and the Far East. These two regional groups had broad powers to investigate reconstruction issues and consult with governments in the region. The European Economic Commission began its work in Geneva in May, and the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its first meeting in Shanghai on June 16.</p>
<p>After the liberation of occupied countries, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) immediately responded to the relief and rehabilitation needs of war-torn countries. This international organization was scheduled to cease operations in 1947, so the United Nations urgently needed to decide how to continue providing relief to countries still in need. The General Assembly discussed this issue last autumn and agreed that the need for relief was coming to an end and that, although urgent, the problem was only short-term. Therefore, the General Assembly did not establish a new international organization to handle relief matters, but resolved that countries should consult with each other to obtain relief. Soon after, a committee was established to determine the needs of countries requiring relief and the ability of those countries to meet those needs themselves. Over the past five months, the Secretary-General has arranged informal consultations to help countries avoid duplication of their relief plans, while also notifying donor countries of the locations and types of relief needed. On May 23, the Secretary-General requested member state governments to provide more information on relief needs and plans.</p>
<p>During the post-war period, the suffering of countries afflicted by famine was exacerbated by the global food shortage. The food crisis still exists today. At the London Conference, the General Assembly urged governments to take strict measures to help conserve food and increase food production. Last autumn, the General Assembly studied the food situation again in New York and put forward detailed recommendations for governments to adopt in order to reduce the food shortage and allow food to be transported to areas where it was most urgently needed.</p>
<p>In Europe, at least 30 million children are poorly clothed, underfed, and on the verge of starvation. In the Far East, there are just as many, or perhaps even more, children in the same situation. They need food, housing, clothing, and medicine. Last autumn, the General Assembly resolved to establish an International Children's Emergency Fund to provide assistance. This fund is made up of voluntary contributions from governments, organizations, and individuals and is now operational, soon providing a steady stream of food and welfare assistance.</p>
<p>In addition, the United Nations has also drawn up plans to appeal to the world to meet the urgent needs of children, adolescents, and pregnant women. This appeal will benefit the International Children's Emergency Fund and other organizations.</p>
<p>Last autumn, in December, the General Assembly also resolved to take over the social welfare activities of the UNRRA Advisory Social Welfare Services, including child welfare, training social welfare workers, restoring social welfare organizations and groups, assisting the disabled, and coordinating the activities of various volunteer organizations.</p>
<p>United Nations Administered Territories</p>
<p>Although representatives of more than 80 percent of humanity attended the San Francisco Conference, the voices of tens of millions of people living in non-self-governing territories were not directly heard when the Charter was drafted. However, their interests were by no means ignored, and the major powers administering these territories took the lead in formulating the Charter's provisions on the political, economic, and social progress of these peoples, as well as their progress toward self-government or independence. A major body, the Trusteeship Council, has been established to administer or supervise territories entrusted to the United Nations.</p>
<p>However, the Trusteeship Council cannot begin its work until non-self-governing territories are voluntarily handed over to be administered under the new international trusteeship system. The major powers administering non-self-governing territories must submit trusteeship agreements stipulating the conditions for administering non-self-governing territories. These agreements must then be approved by the General Assembly, or by the Security Council if they involve strategic areas. Finally, the Trusteeship Council must wait for the General Assembly to elect its member states, half of which are to be countries administering trust territories and half of which are not.</p>
<p>The General Assembly, meeting in London, called on all countries to fulfill the Charter's provisions in this regard. In the autumn of 1946, the General Assembly, meeting in New York, discussed the draft agreements submitted by member states on the eight mandated territories of the former League of Nations. These drafts were thoroughly reviewed and finally adopted, with the result that Tanganyika, British Cameroons, British Togoland, Ruanda-Urundi, French Cameroons, French Togoland, New Guinea, and Western Somoa were all placed under the international trusteeship system. The General Assembly also elected two additional members to the Trusteeship Council to equalize the number of members administering and not administering trust territories. Currently, the members of the Trusteeship Council are Australia, Belgium, China, France, Iran, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States. This important body convened its first session in March and April 1947.</p>
<p>What is the work of the Trusteeship Council like? The records of the first session, although largely concerned with organizational matters, in fact demonstrated the various main activities of the Trusteeship Council. First, the Trusteeship Council drew up a detailed "Provisional Questionnaire" containing 247 questions covering all aspects of activity in the trust territories. This questionnaire is a form to be used by the countries administering non-self-governing territories to submit annual reports on the progress of the residents of their administered territories for review by the General Assembly, so that all 55 member states can understand how the administering countries are implementing the provisions of the Charter.</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>the Trusteeship Council reviewed</p>
<p>dozens of petitions from Tanganyika, issued by German and Italian expatriates who now or formerly resided in the trust territory, requesting the Trusteeship Council to intervene in their deportation back to their countries of origin. Accepting and reviewing these petitions is one of the Trusteeship Council's primary duties. After carefully reviewing the issues raised in the petitions, the Trusteeship Council generally endorsed the British government's policy of deporting undesirable expatriates to their home countries.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Samoan Islands also submitted a petition requesting permission for Samoa to become self-governing and to end the "unnatural division" of the Samoan Islands into American administration and New Zealand trusteeship. The Trusteeship Council unanimously decided to send a fact-finding mission to the area. On July 3, just three weeks after the Trusteeship Council convened its first session, a three-member fact-finding mission set out for Samoa to study what measures the United Nations should take to fulfill the wishes of the people there.</p>
<p>Related to trusteeship, another important event</p>
<p>was the disposal of the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, formerly mandated to Japan. These four island groups were extremely important during the Pacific War. On February 17, 1947, the United States government submitted a draft trusteeship agreement for these four island groups, designating them as "strategic areas" under American administration. The draft agreement was discussed by the Security Council, which handles strategic area trusteeship matters. On April 2, the Security Council unanimously adopted the agreement, which is now awaiting approval by the Chinese government. Once approved, the United States will administer these strategic areas under the conditions of the agreement, in accordance with the international trusteeship system.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Charter on the trusteeship system apply to 14 million people in eight trust territories. What about the hundreds of millions of people in non-self-governing territories that have not been placed under the protection of the United Nations? The Charter also has provisions for the interests of these people, requiring member states responsible for administering these territories to regularly report to the Secretary-General on the economic, social, and educational conditions in those areas.</p>
<p>The United Nations originally had 51 member states. At the second session of the first General Assembly in 1946, Afghanistan, Iceland, Siam, and Sweden were admitted as new member states, bringing the total to 55. Last November, the General Assembly recommended to the Security Council that it re-examine the applications for membership submitted by Albania, Ireland, Outer Mongolia, Portugal, and Transjordan. Subsequently, Hungary and Italy also applied for membership. The Security Council's Committee on Admission of New Members will examine these applications. Currently, the Security Council and various committees of the General Assembly are jointly drafting new rules for the procedure for applying for membership for new member states.</p>
<p>Refugees and Trade Issues</p>
<p>The Second World War created nearly a million refugees and displaced persons who still live in refugee camps in Germany and other locations in Europe. At its initial meetings in January 1946, the General Assembly paid attention to the seriousness of this problem. Before the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees cease operations, there must be an appropriate way to settle these wartime refugees.

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>(1) Pledge Issues</p>
<p>Wu He asks: Legal provisions state that for any term pledge, if it is not redeemed upon expiration, the pledgor loses the right of redemption after three years. If the above overdue situation occurs, should the pledgee directly file a report with the local court, or wait for the pledgor to redeem before processing?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuang replies] If the pledgor does not redeem at the original pledge price after two years have passed from the expiration of the pledge, the pledgee obtains ownership of the pledged item. To complete this procedure: (1) The original pledge agreement and the pledgor's attached title deed must be sent to the Land Administration Bureau for transfer of ownership registration and payment of deed tax. (2) Registration of ownership of the real estate with the court does not require litigation proceedings.</p>
<p>(2) Forced Eviction</p>
<p>Kuai Yixin asks: The old house where I live has two rooms and has been inhabited for more than 20 years. Recently, a house dispute arose due to a change of ownership. Please advise: (1) If the landlord uses the excuse of not collecting rent for three months to reclaim the house, can the tenant propose to the landlord to sign a lease agreement and request to continue living there (there was no lease agreement in the past)? (2) If there is no lease agreement and the landlord orders the tenant to move out, is it illegal to refuse to move out? (3) What should be done if the landlord uses coercion to force eviction? (4) If the landlord forces the tenant to move out simply to increase income, what should be done if the landlord intends to increase the rent?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia replies] (1) It is not necessary to propose a lease agreement. Since the lease was not established in writing, it is regarded as a lease with no fixed term. As for the landlord not collecting rent, it should be deposited according to law. (2) As long as the lease is legal, it does not violate the law. (3) You should file a lawsuit for relief according to the law. The landlord cannot force eviction by coercion. (4) If the landlord needs the tenant to compensate for repairs to the house, and if the amount is not large, it is advisable to give it a little in the current circumstances, in order to settle the matter and appease the person.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Q&amp;A Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Business Department Answers</h3>
<p>[Yonghe Industrial Company, Tokyo Road asks] Our company intends to send codes to branch companies in Nanjing, Hankou, and Tianjin to transmit business messages. What are the procedures for registering these codes? (Answer) There is no registration procedure for code telegrams. All business offices of this bureau can accept them. The price is 2,000 yuan per Chinese code word, and 2,000 yuan per English word, regardless of whether it is clear or coded.</p>
<p>[Huang Yiqing, Dafeng Firm, Zhonghua Road asks] (1) What is the shortest time for an ordinary telegram and an express telegram to Hanjiang to be delivered? (Answer) An ordinary telegram takes about ten hours to arrive, and an express telegram takes five hours. (2) What are the hours for night letter telegrams? (Answer) Night letter telegrams are accepted at any time, but the transmission time must be after 7:00 PM. (3) Are there express night letter telegrams? (Answer) No. (4) Can a night letter telegram to Hanjiang be delivered by noon the next day? (Answer) Night letter telegrams to Hanjiang have not yet been opened.</p>
<p>[Zhu Cailiang, Huangnong Road asks] (1) Applying for a phone line transfer is slow due to the slow exchange of official documents. Can this accumulation of habits be eliminated? (Answer) The application for a phone line transfer must be stamped with the original seal of the user and accompanied by documents proving that the transfer is for self-use. The bureau will send personnel to investigate and verify before the transfer can be processed. However, some users are unaware of the above regulations, which inevitably leads to delays in the procedure. As for the elimination, it is temporarily impossible in order to prevent unauthorized substitution. (2) At night, when making long-distance calls or reporting phone line repairs, there is often no one in charge. Why? (Answer) If there is no response when calling for a long-distance call at night, please call the bureau's number 61443 or the Shanghai Telephone Company's number 42678 to inform the operator of the time, and we will investigate and reply. If a telephone malfunction occurs at night, you can call the 101 telephone measuring station to report the repair. If there is a case of irresponsibility, you can also write a letter to the bureau stating the facts and time, and we will investigate it.</p>
<p>[Li Simi, Fanhua Dulu asks] Why is it more difficult to register for a China-America wireless call than a long-distance call? (Answer) According to the provisional opening locations for China-America wireless calls, they are currently limited to Beijing and Shanghai. However, due to the insufficient number of communication circuits and time, channeling them is difficult, resulting in a congested phenomenon in outbound call records. In order to maintain a balance between the record and the call, it is necessary to limit the number of telephone registrations each month. Moreover, frequent military and government communications between China and the United States should be connected in advance according to regulations, which affects the registration of ordinary users. Currently, the number of requests for registration exceeds the telephone's capacity. The bureau is currently seeking improvements.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Mezzanine Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Mei Lin</p>
<p>He is a section chief, a man with considerable talent in social affairs; therefore, he dresses very carefully, wearing a pullover suit, patterned leather shoes, a fifty-one type gold pen, an automatic swimming luminous watch, and a diamond ring, just like a diplomat. He says "haha" three times every five sentences; after eating, he covers his lips with his palm to pick his teeth, his demeanor is completely upper class. But he has a bad habit, habitually spitting thick phlegm from his nose out of his mouth. This is considered the most terrible thing by hygienists, more disgusting than holding phlegm and not spitting when listening to others. When I pointed out to him this bad habit that could make his girlfriend turn her head and leave, he laughed loudly and said:</p>
<p>"This is very common. Many great people spit in the same way." Then, with a laugh, he told a joke: "Women will never turn their heads and leave because you spit thick phlegm from your mouth, it doesn't matter if you are covered in fox odor or have other bad smells. As long as you have a great aura and dress luxuriously. For example, if you are wearing a pullover suit worth millions of yuan, and you curl your lips arrogantly and fiercely, women will throw flirtatious glances at you. You, old brother, only pay attention to small details, not big scenes. Ha, ha, ha."</p>
<p>This may be his experience, not purely a joke. I don't need to be surprised, what I am surprised by is his explanation and supplement to the "spitting method".</p>
<p>"In fact, spitting depends on each person's habits. It is certainly wonderful to cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief to cough up, but the thought of having some slippery phlegm in your pocket is really uncomfortable. Pinching your nose with your fingers and flicking it? It's like a country bumpkin, very ugly. Only spitting out both phlegm and mucus from the mouth at the same time is the simplest. Many people adopt this "spitting method" not by chance, there is a great reason for it, ha, ha, ha."</p>
<p>I had to open my eyes wide and stare at his smug face, and I couldn't help but marvel.</p>
<p>He talked about the spitting method, about the "philosophy of following". According to him, human history is a history of "following", the followers following the generals, the generals following the emperor; thus success and failure, rise and fall, are acting out "historical dramas". The so-called knowledge is only useful if it is applicable to "following", otherwise to hell with it. He said that the reason why he was able to wear a pullover suit worth millions of yuan was because he "followed". He will continue to "follow" until he has a car, a foreign house, and a concubine.</p>
<p>I fell into deep thought, I seemed to see a "great person" growing up.</p>
<p>In Huangjiacun, people with the surname Huang lived together in a clan. They were living in houses left behind by their ancestors. They were fighting over and damaging the few public courtyards belonging to each house.</p>
<p>So, the following happened:</p>
<p>Aunt Huang washed her face and splashed the water into the courtyard, and the dirty mud immediately splashed everywhere, many splashes landed on Aunt San's chicken coop.</p>
<p>Aunt Huang San immediately turned pale and cursed:</p>
<p>"Are you blind? Splashing face water randomly!"</p>
<p>Aunt Huang could not bear it and retorted:</p>
<p>"I just want to splash it, the courtyard is public, what's it to you!"</p>
<p>So they cursed at each other, cursing to the point of white heat. Uncle Huang San could not bear the anger and came to help curse, while Big Brother Huang naturally could not let his wife fight alone.</p>
<p>"You stinking thing! Cursing a few more words, I'll break your dog legs!"</p>
<p>Big Brother Huang stared with big eyes like a yellow cow and replied fiercely for his wife;</p>
<p>"You castrated bull! You deserve to be slaughtered; if you have the ability, let's fight!"</p>
<p>Uncle Huang San really found a hoe and went straight at Big Brother Huang; Big Brother Huang then grabbed a carrying pole. So, the two sides danced at each other, and a war broke out.</p>
<p>"They're fighting again! Why bother? Alas!"</p>
<p>Uncle Huang, who lived next door, came over to mediate. He had a head full of "neutrality" and a belly full of "peace"; but in his home, because of the public courtyard, the younger generation who had separated from the family often quarreled with him.</p>
<p>The war stopped, but the infighting intensified greatly, and the dirty mud water in the courtyard increased every day. Everyone held this principle:</p>
<p>— If your chicken coop can be placed in the courtyard to poop, so can mine; if you throw things into the courtyard, don't think I won't do the same? Hmph! The courtyard is public!</p>
<p>So, this courtyard became a stinking pit, flies and infectious germs bred there, and the dirty mud water, exposed to the scorching sun in June, evaporated a smell even stronger than ammonia.</p>
<p>Aunt Huang's precious Ah Fu suddenly fell ill, didn't want to eat, didn't want to drink, was always feverish, and talked nonsense. Aunt Huang was so anxious that she called on the bodhisattva, but Aunt Huang San was secretly saying:</p>
<p>"Good! You deserve it!"</p>
<p>But when Aunt Huang's precious Ah Fu was about to die, Aunt Huang San's darling Gui Cai also fell ill, also with a fever, talking nonsense, exactly like Ah Fu's symptoms.</p>
<p>Aunt Huang San no longer gloated, and her heart was also anxiously beating wildly. At the same time, all the people in the village, young and old, heard the news about this plague? This was truly a "natural disaster"!</p>
<p>Uncle Huang had experience and hurriedly went to find old men of his age. After frowning and discussing, they decided to follow the ancient method of "suppressing the disaster".</p>
<p>Auspicious day on the Yellow Calendar was chosen. They built a blessing altar at Fang Niu Ping. A Bodhisattva was brought from San Sheng Temple and placed on the blessing altar for worship. Several shaven-headed monks, wearing cassocks, were knocking on wooden fish and chanting sutras there.</p>
<p>Incense smoke curled up, paper ashes flew around, and the Bodhisattva sat solemnly, but with eyes closed. An endless stream of Huang descendants went to kowtow, seeming very pious.</p>
<p>Uncle Huang San and his wife came back from the blessing altar with dirty heads, praying in their hearts that their darling Gui Cai's illness would get better. On the way, Aunt Huang San saw many large pieces of yellow paper with black characters pasted on the wall. She hurriedly asked her husband what they meant. Uncle Huang San piously read:</p>
<p>"Clan members, start eating vegetarian food!"</p>
<p>"Go to the blessing altar to kowtow sincerely!"</p>
<p>"Support the Bodhisattva to eliminate the plague!"</p>
<p>"Long live the Bodhisattva!"</p>
<h3>Summer in Beidaihe</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Last summer was the most leisurely summer of my life. As the pomegranate flowers were just beginning to turn red on the branches, my family from Fujian went to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat, or perhaps it could be said, to escape trouble! We rented three bungalows in Dabohezhai, choosing it for its proximity to the sea and the tranquility of rural life. With nothing to do during the long summer days, we had plenty of leisure, plenty of freedom, and the opportunity to travel together as a family. How could I forget this summer?</p>
<p>In the early morning, a window of morning light shone through the sparse peach branches in the backyard, and the tomatoes, corn, and sunflowers in the garden were all glistening with morning dew, vibrant and green. I busied myself watering and weeding, grooming this little enclosure for a while, then took the children along the broad path of the fields, walking up and down the undulating mountain trails. Along the way, we picked wildflowers, summer chrysanthemums, wild asters, mountain azaleas, rock narcissus, and other nameless mountain blossoms, filling the little girls' hair and lapels. Below the mountain, the waves of wheat rippled in the wind, like a young girl's soft hair just beginning to show a touch of charming ripples. In the distance, the majestic peaks beyond Shanhaiguan guarded the strategic pass, arranged like a protective screen, hidden in the clouds and mist. Sometimes, one could vaguely make out the dragon-like Great Wall, as if it were boasting of its historical greatness and glory. Looking closer, the east and west mountains were densely dotted with villas of various styles and colors, with the serenity of the villas peeking through the lush greenery, like fresh blossoms blooming among green branches and leaves, or like countless colorful embroideries woven onto a green velvet carpet.</p>
<p>Coming down the mountain and out of Liuzhuang, we were at the seaside. The sea breeze and waves were playing a rhythmic and magnificent music, delighting the children so much that they danced and shouted in unison, "Ah! The magnificent sea!" The younger ones sat on the beach, picking up seashells and building pyramids of fine sand, while the older ones ran into the sea, chasing and playing with the waves. I lay naked on the beach, silently facing the sea and sky, looking up at the few white clouds, freely drifting and unfurling. Suddenly, I heard the children in the sea waving and calling for me to join them, so I plunged into the embrace of the sea with them, washing away the dirt and grime from my body and mind, feeling light, refreshed, and almost like an immortal. Clear mountains and green waters are inherently welcoming to all, but those who are caught up in the pursuit of fame and fortune, indulging in air-conditioned comfort, can only blame themselves for distancing themselves from nature and forgetting nature. This disordered world makes it seem as if there is nothing to enjoy!</p>
<p>Among the four seasons, spring only offers intoxicating temptation, autumn hints at feelings of decline and sadness, and winter is especially harsh and threatening to the poor. Only summer, with its light and warmth, encourages people and is willing to give the poor more opportunities to connect with nature. To show our gratitude for summer's generosity, we should accept its gifts!</p>
<p>As the setting sun sinks in the west, the summer heat completely dissipates. All the children, including myself, still linger, reluctant to return, until the sky is filled with stars.</p>
<p>Sparse and scattered village lights, along with shepherds and fishermen, head home on the same path.</p>
<p>Lu You wrote in his poem, "Occasionally I call for a fast horse to greet the new moon, but instead I board a light carriage to enjoy the evening breeze." This was Lu You's leisure when he was an official. Although I have no fast horse to ride or light carriage to sit in, I hold my soaking wet bathing suit in one hand and my shoes in the other, walking barefoot on the rustling sandy beach, with the waves constantly washing over my ankles, which is also quite a unique and interesting experience!</p>
<p>Being barefoot and half-naked is very common in Beidaihe. Women can wear bathing suits and walk around freely and comfortably on the streets, everyone equally sharing the natural life of the countryside.</p>
<p>Beidaihe is the summer girl of the North, but she possesses the charm of a Western beauty and the graceful posture of a Jiangnan maiden. However, after being away for a year, she is now resting amidst the surrounding fires of war. How can I not care about her safety?</p>
<h3>Flowers and Trees</h3>
<p>— Qing Guo</p>
<p>Yang Locust Trees</p>
<p>A long road lined with Yang locust trees on both sides looks beautiful enough.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, it's like a tunnel formed by two green walls. The turning points seem to hide endless tranquility and mystery, and a sense of remoteness will tickle your heart. Walking there, you will forget your fatigue, you will lose your ability to calculate distances and stop your steps, just like pursuing a hope, just moving forward.</p>
<p>Several times, I thought, suppose there was a girl in green gauze under the Yang locust tree, our passionate singing and burning loving eyes flowing through the branches and leaves, melting together...</p>
<p>Several times, I thought, suppose there was a red lantern under the Yang locust tree, slowly floating from the dark night waves, accompanied by wanton laughter and light footsteps...</p>
<p>To be honest, I like Yang locust trees very much.</p>
<p>I wonder how vast it would be to have a green dream under the Yang locust trees.</p>
<p>Now the flowers of the Yang locust tree are blooming again, and the road is filled with an intoxicating fragrance.</p>
<p>I strolled, stepping on fallen flowers, stepping on fragrance; I was thinking of a person, a story...</p>
<p>I wish I had a real green dream, and one that was covered in Yang locust flowers.</p>
<p>Rose</p>
<p>Outside the window is a small garden.</p>
<p>When dawn brushes away the dream shadows pressing on my eyelids, a light fragrance gently caresses my face.</p>
<p>I know that the roses that have crept over from the night are blooming again.</p>
<p>The rose is under the window, and when I open the window, it is the first thing that jumps into view. It will tether my gaze, letting the blooming flowers and the unopened buds both be knotted in my sight before letting me look at the trees and grass that form a green curtain.</p>
<p>On the table, I have a pitifully small vase with roses in it. Every day, I diligently change the water and enthusiastically change the flowers; the water that has been changed is poured at the base of the rose bush under the window, and the wilting flowers that have been changed are also thrown at the base of the rose bush under the window.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I also feel a little sad: don't the dead flowers also have an unforgettable past? However, the newly born flowers are decorating a beautiful future.</p>
<p>One day, a few children ran into my room and snatched the roses in the vase, leaving me only a dying flower.</p>
<p>But they all smiled happily, each with a rose in their mouth, and said to me:</p>
<p>"These are ours."</p>
<p>Just as I was about to go forward to snatch them back, they all swallowed the flowers.</p>
<p>Then, roses bloomed on their faces and mouths, blooming so brightly and brilliantly.</p>
<h3>Poems by Fan Jun of Xiangxi</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>The prose of Fan Jun of Xiangxi is abrupt, vigorous, and clear, establishing him as a master in his own right, but his poems lack originality. However, the chapter on Listening to the Qin says: "The listeners all hear the qin, but may not know the qin's sound. Acquaintances fill the eyes, but may not know the heart. Knowing sound is like Ziqi, knowing heart is like Bao Shu. This way has long been desolate, who can follow their high footsteps? Ancient sounds should not be played again, ancient hearts are only for self-pity; only the moon and dew know the sound, only Heaven knows me. Do you not see, today's human feelings are as thin as paper, today's worldly paths are as treacherous as streams. Hmph, such things are not worth discussing, the traces of birds are faint, passing through the vastness." It uniquely expresses a deep sigh.</p>
<h3>Aphorisms on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Wei Yong</p>
<p>Poetry is the sound of feelings expressed with color.</p>
<p>So-called poetry is the art of arranging words – it is also the art of using words to create an illusion in the mind.</p>
<p>Poetry is [unclear] character.</p>
<p>It is music of thought, woven by [unclear] real [unclear].</p>
<p>Poetry is the record of the mind that prioritizes career at its highest and most [unclear] moment.</p>
<p>Poetry is the words of profound, sincere and true truth.</p>
<p>Writing poetry is choosing the best fruit.</p>
<p>Poetry is the recollection of emotions in their state of tranquility.</p>
<p>In the creation of poetry, the representation of words accounts for one-tenth, and the other nine-tenths is the reflection of your life. Poetry is the resonance of emotions.</p>
<h3>Young Bullfighter</h3>
<p>— Manet</p>
<p>Manet (Edouard Manet 1832-1883) was the precursor to Impressionism. As a youth, he studied under T. Couture, but dissatisfied with his teacher's dull style, he sought his own path and engaged in studying impressionistic techniques. In 1863, he submitted "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe" to the Salon, but was unfortunately rejected. Thereupon, he invited young artists of similar style who had also been rejected to hold a joint "Exhibition of Rejected Artists." Although they were ridiculed by the general literati of the time, they established a new theory of painting regardless.</p>
<p>The characteristic of his style is the pursuit of outdoor light and the capture of the impression of things in a flash. The name "Impressionism" was thus derived. Representative works include "Olympia," "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe," etc. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 349</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I did a quick calculation and asked Dingyuan: "You and Miss Yaoqun have no agreed place or method for seeing each other again?" I decided to go to Shuangyi Bridge too.</p>
<p>"She said she would come find me, but she didn't specify a time. She already memorized my location... it's the same place where Captain Sun met me in the evening..." Dingyuan said, glancing at the big guy standing beside him, revealing a hint of a smile.</p>
<p>"How did you meet Mr. Wu?" I looked at "Zero Four."</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Chief Secretary, I didn't meet Mr. Wu... Mr. Wu met me, rushing to call me Captain Sun; I was startled and didn't recognize any monk. Later Mr. Wu said, 'I am Wu Dingyuan, the engineer from Changxindian, and now I have become a monk!' Then, I looked carefully and realized it really was Engineer Wu... and he returned the pistol to me."</p>
<p>I was just about to tell Dingyuan and Da Shazi that we were preparing to leave for Shuangyi Bridge to inquire about Yaoqun's whereabouts when another telegram arrived. This was from "Zero Twelve" in Tokyo:</p>
<p>"Confirmed. KCC will reach Ping within two days, please prepare for all senior staff to meet and discuss; urgent."</p>
<p>The word "Confirmed" refers to the content of the previous secret telegram; KCC is a code name for Tsurumi. The previous telegram reported Tsurumi's experiences in Tokyo over the past two days, which were dangerous and complex; because he took advantage of the special circumstances of "training" to redeploy the search for "Seven Secret Letters," this move was almost discovered by the joint front of the German Fifth Column and the Matsu Group cadres. But finally, Tsurumi and Pingzi's group discovered another new route; now they are preparing to unite all their troops and W Jun's subordinates to carry out large-scale work in Guanyang, what kind of work is not specified, only saying "continued disclosure," and also saying that KCC plans to fly to Ping within two or three days and is arranging the "route."</p>
<p>According to my guess, this "work" seems to be unrelated to the "Secret Letters," perhaps referring to formally breaking up with the Matsu Group and fighting them, otherwise why go to Shenyang, why gather all the troops and unite with W Jun's subordinates? But there is no way to inquire about the meaning of the word "work" from "Zero Twelve": With the habit of exchanging secret messages, whenever there is a question that is not fully understood, or when the time has not yet come to publish the question, I always use the three words "continued disclosure" to indicate that the other party does not need to ask further, as asking would be useless.</p>
<p>I immediately relayed the contents of these two telegrams to W Jun's headquarters in Beiping, and also briefly told Dingyuan and "Zero Four," and ordered "Zero Four" to prepare writing materials; in any case, Dingyuan had to return to his "residence" that night, so we could just send him back and then go inquire about Yaoqun's whereabouts. I believe there is no more important matter than this at present. I also told "Zero Four" to tell Liu Wu to pay attention to receiving the report at four o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>But my plan was opposed by Dingyuan and "Zero Four." They believed that it was already past midnight, and I, as the acting chief of the general team, should be stationed at the radio station, and should also rest a little. Another reason was that my personal movements were more likely to attract attention – assuming that someone was already paying attention! It was best to remain still. Moreover, "Zero Four" could go to any place I wanted to go, and "Zero Four" could also act on my behalf in inquiring about things; he was even more familiar with the route than I was, because of his daytime experience. The last reason was that although Liu Wu said he could receive reports, it was limited to mechanical work; in case he encountered a problem that needed to be solved immediately, he would be unable to do it.</p>
<h3>Prices Fall!</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Prices are generally falling, and this is something that has been happening in recent months.</p>
<p>It's like a whirlwind and torrential rain suddenly blowing in the middle of a scorching heat.</p>
<p>This whirlwind and torrential rain explains a few things: (1) The special envoy Wei [unclear] from the United States has already departed from the United States. His arrival indicates that the United States is actively assisting China, and China's economic situation will transition into a new stage. (2) Sino-Japanese trade is about to resume, and Japanese goods are coming immediately. Japan's wartime industry has not been damaged, and its costs are much lower than China's. (3) In the past two days, credit has been tight, and commercial firms have had to throw out goods in order to absorb cash.</p>
<p>So you see: rice has almost retreated into the 400,000 range; rayon is plummeting; Chinese stocks are falling to the limit; cotton cloth and cooking oil are also declining, and even the black market for gold and currency has to retreat in the face of this trend.</p>
<p>Falling prices are always a good sign for small citizens, but for industry and commerce, it is a serious signal! During these times, because prices were rising, the chips of industry and commerce were all placed on the "speculation" gambling table, because that could give them even thicker interest margins. One turn of the hand could immediately bring in tens of millions or hundreds of millions, but when the basic factors of these speculative markets completely disappear, that is, if China's economic situation truly transitions into a stable stage, the black market for gold and currency will no longer be a black market, and cotton cloth and rayon will plummet due to the dumping of Japanese goods, then, I ask you, the industrial and commercial magnates who are keen on "speculation," what will you do?</p>
<p>This is not a beautiful prediction. Sino-Japanese trade will soon be implemented, and Wedemeyer will soon bring economic aid to China. Our industrial and commercial magnates, you should see how others are restoring production. Now is no longer the time to stay on the "speculation" gambling table, turning clouds and overturning rain.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>America, Soviet Union, Korea</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, the United States and the Soviet Union occupied Korea according to the Potsdam Agreement, with the US in the South and the Soviet Union in the North, each going its own way, and political, economic, and cultural development followed their respective主張.</p>
<p>Probably both sides realized that this approach was not right, so they agreed to form a US-Soviet Joint Committee, wanting to unite North and South Korea to establish a Korean provisional government. Negotiations were progressing smoothly last month, but today's newspaper reports that US General Brown issued a condemnation of the Soviet Union's use of its veto power, causing a stalemate, and the establishment of the Korean provisional government may be stillborn.</p>
<p>In 1884 (the tenth year of the Guangxu reign), during the Kim Ok-gyun incident, a pro-Japanese cabinet was formed in Korea. Yuan Shikai quelled the unrest, and Japan sent troops to Korea, forcing Korea to sign the Treaty of Seoul in January 1885 (the eleventh year of Guangxu). On April 18 of the same year, Ito Hirobumi and Li Hongzhang signed the Treaty of Tianjin, withdrawing Chinese and Japanese troops stationed in Korea. In 1894 (the twentieth year of Guangxu), the Tonghak Peasant Revolution broke out in Korea, and both countries sent troops to quell it, leading to the Sino-Japanese War. In 1895 (the twenty-first year of Guangxu), China and Japan signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, making Korea nominally independent and transferring diplomatic relations to Japan alone. In the same year, Russia, Germany, and France intervened, returning the Liaodong Peninsula, and China withdrew, with Russia officially taking the stage, and the Sino-Japanese contest for Korea turned into a Russo-Manchurian competition.</p>
<p>In 1904 (the thirtieth year of Guangxu), the Russo-Japanese War began, and Russia was defeated. In 1905 (the thirty-first year of Guangxu), Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, with Russia ceding all its rights in Southern Manchuria, obtained from China, to Japan. After the end of World War I, Russia underwent revolution, and Japan rose to become one of the five great powers. After the September 18th Incident in Manchuria, the Japanese created the puppet state of "Manchukuo," and Russian influence in Manchuria was completely expelled, with Japan dominating Korea and Manchuria. Two years ago, at the end of World War II, the Soviet Union regained and even surpassed its Tsarist Russian influence in Manchuria and Korea, and Korea became a battleground for US-Soviet occupation.</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, the protagonists vying for Korea were China and Japan. Sixty years later, although the protagonists vying for Korea cannot be said to be the US and the Soviet Union, the two countries have different ideologies, and their occupation and governance policies are inconsistent. If this continues for a long time, the boundaries will become increasingly clear. General Wedemeyer recently came to inspect China and Korea, and after seeing the current state of Korea and the situation in Northeast China, he will prepare a report in the future. I wonder what the White House master will do?</p>
<p>We are thinking for the sake of the US and Korea, we are thinking for the sake of Korea, hoping that the US-Soviet negotiated Korean government will be established immediately, and that the US and the Soviet Union will withdraw from Korea; at the same time, we hope that the Soviet Union will abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, so that the situation in Korea and Manchuria can be clarified and that the US and the Soviet Union will not stage the old drama of China-Japan and Russo-Japanese conflicts.</p>
<h3>Good and Evil in Human Nature</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Sheng</p>
<p>There are many incredible things in the world, and there are also many non-unique things in the world. The former is the manifestation of metaphysics and ghosts, and the latter is the representation of the scientific spirit.</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, Mencius and Xunzi of China each guarded a solid fortress, resisting and attacking each other. Mencius's fortress was the goodness of human nature, and Xunzi's fortress was the evil of human nature. It was difficult to determine the winner, and so it remains to this day. Although they are both dead, the two fortresses are still guarded by their disciples who inherit their teachings.</p>
<p>In sixteenth-century France, the same thing happened. François Rabelais and John Calvin were both representatives of the academic world at the time. Rabelais said: Human nature is good. Calvin said: Human nature is evil. His doctrine of the evil of human nature had an unparalleled emphasis and sharp theory. The two can be said to be powerful disputants about the soul during the Renaissance: Rabelais regarded God as a compassionate manager of the universe, while Calvin regarded God as an impartial judge.</p>
<p>Although the periods were one before the other, research from a historical perspective shows that Rabelais and Calvin were not influenced by Xunzi's remarks at all, but completely came from themselves. This kind of academic "ten thousand miles of predestined connection without a line," "a match made in heaven," is precisely an incredible thing.</p>
<p>Rabelais's value is very shaky today; Calvin is still respected as a great figure with the highest ideals. Old Master Meng was fortunate, and the East is different from the West after all, and China is different from France after all.</p>

<h3>The Beitashan Incident</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>Including Geographic and Ethnic Factors</p>
<p>Beitashan is in the northeast of Xinjiang, close to the west of Mongolia, and is a hilly mountain range with an altitude of around 1,000 meters. This area is sparsely populated, with hundreds of miles of fertile grassland, belonging to the Junggar Basin. The basin is located at a very high latitude and is extremely far from the sea, so the difference between hot and cold is extreme, and rainfall is scarce, forming a dry area. Therefore, animal husbandry has replaced agriculture; but agriculture is not undeveloped. Most of the residents are Han Chinese, who are not accustomed to animal husbandry and have to engage in agriculture, making the area the largest grain-producing area in the North. In addition to animal husbandry and agriculture, the area also produces minerals such as gold, petroleum, and uranium. To the east of Beitashan is a large sand desert called the Gurbantunggut Desert. Because the light in this desert is easily refracted, parallax often occurs. At night, the starlight feels particularly bright, and during the day, distant mountains and forests seem to be right in front of you, hence the saying, "Gazing at the mountain tires the horse to death, taking things is a vague question." Because the area bordering Outer Mongolia is quite long, with only the Altai Mountains in between, the Altai Mountains stretch from northwest to southeast, from [Zha Ke] to the Junggar region on the north side of the Tianshan Mountains. The flat sands stretch as far as the eye can see, with no high mountains or large rivers to defend, and the people living in this area are all nomadic peoples. This is the geographic factor in the Beitashan Incident.</p>
<p>Beitashan is only 900 li away from Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province. If Beitashan is not defended, enemy cavalry could advance 300 li south and occupy Qitai County, which lies between Hami and Dihua, cutting off the only route from Xinjiang Province to Lanzhou. Xinjiang Province's international transportation route west from Yining to the Soviet Union, and the two routes from Hotan to India, have long been closed; the only route to the interior passes through Lanzhou, Jiuquan, Lixingxia, Hami, Zhenxi, Qitai, and Dihua, a total length of about 4,000 li. Qitai is the trade hub of this route, as well as the commercial center of the entire province, and more importantly, a strategic military location.</p>
<p>The southern end of the Soviet Central Asian heavy industrial heartland, the U.K.K. area of Karaganda, is only 500 nautical miles from Tacheng in Xinjiang, and the huge steel and coal industrial area of Stalinsk in the Kuznetsk Basin is only 400 nautical miles from Chenghua Temple in Altai.</p>
<p>The Tianshan Mountains, which run across Xinjiang, divide the province into northern and southern parts. The protruding tip of the northern part is the Altai Mountains mentioned above, where Kazakhs and Mongolian nomadic people live. It is the base of past disturbances in Xinjiang Province and a place coveted by foreigners. In the past decade or so, no incident in Xinjiang has not originated in the Altai Mountains. The Altai Mountains are the fifth administrative region in northeastern Xinjiang Province. The district government was initially located in Chenghua. The Altai region has a vast area, rich mineral resources, and a population of 63,040 people, of whom 53,352 are Kazakhs, accounting for about 75 percent. Others include Han Chinese, Uyghurs, Hui people, Kyrgyz people, and Mongolians. The Kazakhs and Uyghurs were the main actors in the Yining Incident, due to their large population and their hostility towards the Han people. These people cherish a deep feeling of yearning for their motherland, but also harbor a long-standing feeling of disappointment, and cannot help but turn to [foreign country]'s embrace; they have obtained Soviet citizenship and become people with dual nationalities, which is so painful! The Kazakhs were originally called Turkestan. The so-called "East Turkestan Republic" in the past was also instigated by the Uyghurs and Kazakhs, thus leading to the "Yining Incident." Now, the flags and insignia of the "East Turkestan" government can be seen everywhere. Yes, the phenomena of the "East Turkestan" era not only still exist in the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and the Altai Mountains, but have also moved to Dihua. In addition, the Mongolians are also worth noting; because the Mongolian people had a period of considerable influence ruling Xinjiang, and there are still 150,000 people of Mongolian origin remaining in Xinjiang, scattered in Yanqi District, Tacheng District, Yili District, Altai District, Usu District, etc. Because their number is smaller than other ethnic groups, conflicts with other ethnic groups may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>The ethnic composition of Xinjiang is very complex, and the Altai Mountain region is even more so.</p>
<h3>Miscellany from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Jiquan</p>
<p>Dancing Education in America</p>
<p>Education in a broad sense is not limited to rote learning, to being bogged down in books, or to dying by books; rather, it encompasses everything and lacks nothing. Therefore, American-style education includes sex education talks, atomic energy talks, and dance training. Besides each university having a dance course dedicated to teaching stage performance dance, there are also many specialized dance schools. These schools are generally quite large in scale. When I was in Houston, I visited Abe's Dancing School. It was located upstairs, with shops below. You walked up the stairs from the side door directly to the principal's office. From the principal's office, you could access the dance floor and dressing room. The dance floor was very large, even larger than the dance floors of professional dance halls in Shanghai. And this dance school was not the largest in Houston. The dance floor was surrounded by large glass mirrors, so beginners could see their postures. It could accommodate forty or fifty couples dancing. The tuition fee was divided into two types: single lessons were two dollars per half hour, payable each time or in full for a term. Paying once counted as one lesson, but if you made an appointment and didn't show up, it still counted as one lesson. Group lessons were one dollar each time, and group dances were held twice a week, practically like holding a dance party. The head teachers were the principal and his wife, and talented students served as teaching assistants, all of whom were high school girls aged seventeen or eighteen. They were not only patient and encouraging but also considerate in every detail. On the third floor, there was a class dedicated to teaching stage performance dance and Russian dance. The students all took off their outer garments, leaving only triangular briefs and bras. Along the window was a handrail about two zhang long. Beginners held onto the rail with one hand, so they could practice raising their legs without wobbling. Powders chests and legs, a wonderful movie setting. This is extremely effective for various dance skills, guaranteeing success. The instruction is extremely strict. Those learning stage performance dance must practice diligently for at least two hours each day, dancing until they are covered in sweat and panting heavily. Americans consider dancing to be a wonderful way to stay healthy, not just an art form. And the beauty of American women lies in the beauty of their legs, which are longer and stronger than those of Eastern women, largely due to dancing. Chinese women lack proper exercise. Those who are congenitally deficient are often melancholic and prone to illness, like Lin Daiyu. Some who are pampered and well-off become grotesquely obese, like water buffaloes. I oppose using dancing as a tool for profit, but I support using dancing as a department of aesthetic education. (23)</p>
<h3>Summer Records by the Light of a Firefly Window</h3>
<p>— Fengren</p>
<p>Different Tunes, Same Melody</p>
<p>I happened to read a passage in "Worries of Weilu" (畏廬瑣記), which records a story about Liu Xiaoyi (劉孝議):</p>
<p>"Liu Xiaolian (劉孝廉), whose name is omitted, claimed to be unfortunate in marriage. After his wife died, Liu wrote a poem: 'Let our karmic bond not be mistaken in the next life; may we meet again in this life's dreams.' At night, he would embrace his wife's wooden tablet as he slept and woke. He also made a small wooden tablet of his wife, with a small ivory pendant, hanging it on his chest. Every time he spoke, he would mention his wife. After a while, people became quite tired of hearing it, and Liu himself became despondent. One day, a friend visited Liu's house, thinking that Liu must be sleeping alone since he had lost his wife. He pushed aside the curtains to check his bed, only to find him sleeping in the same bed with the maidservant. The wooden tablet was under the bed. The friend laughed loudly."</p>
<p>It seems to me that the so-called "hypocrite" is probably this kind of person. On the surface, they are perfectly benevolent and righteous, like true gentlemen, but secretly they have many unspeakable deeds. I remember the story of the "Filial Son's Archway" (孝子坊) at South Ping Mountain (南屏山) in Hangzhou, which has a similar melody. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Initially, the filial son mourned his mother's death, shutting himself in his room in grief. Every time he cried, flocks of birds would gather, and this continued undiminished for three years. As the birds gathered in increasing numbers, the neighbors were astonished by his extraordinary filial piety. The county official petitioned for him to be commended, and the emperor granted him a "Filial Son's Archway." The entire county marveled at this revival of ancient virtues. But the filial son continued to shut himself in and mourn as before. Some doubters, disbelieving, peeked through his door one day while he was crying. They saw the filial son walking in the courtyard, crying and scattering rice. The birds heard the sound of his crying and knew they would get food, so they flocked together by the thousands. The person then laughed loudly. Because the crying caused confusion and strangeness, the filial son moved away, but the stone archway remains to this day, recording the filial son's story."</p>
<p>This play is indeed very brilliant. This filial son certainly had an immense theatrical talent. Liu Xiaolian should feel ashamed of himself in comparison. In fact, these kinds of hypocrites are not limited to Liu Xiaolian and a few others. However, because their techniques are more sophisticated and their methods are more clever, everyone has been deceived, and they are regarded as mirrors of brilliance. If someone were to tear through their facade and expose them, I am afraid that hatred of truth would be worth nothing!</p>
<h3>General Overview of the Antarctic</h3>
<p>— Ning Xuren</p>
<p>In the world we humans inhabit, in addition to the five continents of Asia, America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania, there is also Antarctica. We can see both poles and the eastern and western hemispheres of the Earth on the terrestrial globe. The upper end is the Arctic, and the lower end is the Antarctic. Most of Antarctica is within the Antarctic Circle, spanning both the eastern and western hemispheres. It was only recently discovered and can be called the newest continent.</p>
<p>Antarctica is farther from the places where humans live than the Arctic, so exploration began hundreds of years later than that of the Arctic. In 1773, Cook circumnavigated the Antarctic, and the following year discovered South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands, becoming the first person to explore the Antarctic. In the early 19th century, successors emerged in an endless stream. In 1839, the British Ross, aboard his flagship, entered the Antarctic Circle and discovered the Ross Sea, King Edward VII Land, and Mount Erebus, opening the way for today's exploration and becoming the most prominent figure of the 19th century. Later, many others went to Antarctica. Recently, with the development of aviation, U.S. Rear Admiral Byrd became a great figure in Antarctic exploration. In 1925, he flew to the Antarctic, and in 1928, he made a second expedition, flying over mountains 3,600 meters high and passing through plateaus 3,000 meters high. He discovered that there were many mountain ranges in Antarctica, confirming that Antarctica is indeed a continent. Since then, Antarctica has begun to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>Antarctica is a vast ice and snow plateau, covering more than 14 million square kilometers. The periphery of Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is connected to the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans without boundaries. Its distribution of land and water is the opposite of the Arctic. The Arctic is centered on water, with the Arctic Ocean surrounded by the three continents of Europe, Asia, and America, while Antarctica is centered on land. The day and night in the Antarctic are also the opposite of the Arctic. From April to August, the sun is below the horizon, with night but no day. From August to April, the sun is above the horizon, with day but no night. When it is summer in the Antarctic, it is winter in the Arctic. The average temperature is below zero degrees, and rainfall is very scarce, averaging 300 mm.</p>
<p>Both the North and South Poles have a strange glow called the aurora, which is caused by the phenomenon of electrical bands radiating from the sun in the sky. The Antarctic aurora is shaped like a circular arc, with yellow-purple colors, extremely brilliant and beautiful. Its luminosity is not as strong as the Arctic aurora, and its frequency is also less.</p>
<p>The vegetation in the Antarctic is not as abundant as in the Arctic, because it is surrounded by large oceans, separated from other continents, and the climate is also cold. The only discoveries are mosses and algae. There are no residents in Antarctica, and there are few animals. However, there are whales, sea dogs, and sea elephants in the sea. Birds include petrels and seagulls. On land, there are many penguins. Besides these, there are no other plants or animals.</p>
<p>Antarctica was discovered by explorers from countries such as Britain and the United States. The issue of sovereignty over the territory has not yet been resolved. Therefore, countries do not easily give up. Because Antarctica has many good harbors that can become fishing ports or naval ports, and there are also many treasures waiting to be developed.</p>
