<h3>兒童節和兒童新事業</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<p>今天欣逢中華民國第十六屆兒童節，作者是最初提倡兒童節和參加中央兒童年實施委員會的一個。追溯已往，展望將來，感覺到慶祝兒童節，應該從實際倡導兒童事業入手。現在趁這極可紀念的日子，來把這一點檢討一下：</p>
<p>歸功於心理，生理，教育等科學研究的進展，近代約有識之士，重視起兒童來，建立了一個兒童本身有價值的信念。加以接連二次世界大戰的教訓，啟示我們人力是決勝一切的先決條件，因此使得任何國家寶貴他們的兒童，只要看各國都有兒童節和兒童保障條例，就可作為佐證。講到我國，只要查一查兒童節誕生的歷史，誰都知道，上海市是中華民國兒童節的發祥地。十餘年前中華慈幼協會，上海市政府和上海市兒童幸福委員會等團體，都有不可磨滅的倡導功蹟。當時，上海的一班前進的工商業，都起來擁護這個極有意義的兒童節，並且創辦了各種兒童事業。據我所知，各報約有兒童周刊，以及商人的創辦兒童玩具廠，兒童服裝公司等，都是政府規定了兒童節和兒童年後創立的。就是專供兒童精神糧食的兒童書局，雖於事前創設，但因此而擴大發展！亦爲事實！接着全國兒童事業就如雨後春筍，蓬蓬勃勃地相繼興起來了。這一點，極足證明，兒童節變成社會運動後，已把工商界的營業方針轉移到兒童身上去。現在再來談談英美各國，在他們的社會上常常可以看到兒童的世界。單就市政建設來講，他們的目標一方面爲成人着想，同時一定也顧到兒童的福利。例如兒童公園，兒童運動場，兒童圖書館，兒童醫院，兒童實騐室，兒童劇場等等，都擬在計劃裏，一一逐步實現。在美國有一種私人事業，叫做全美兒童樂園（Boy＇s　Club），這種社團是一種社會性的組織，總會設在紐約，分會遍佈各州各地。大約每個分會都有兒童會員一百人至一萬人，該會的目的，在供給各種有益兒童身心的活動，使兒童在身體上健康上，精神上，職業上，社交上，獲得各種修養。創辦和主持該會的人，都是當地熱心兒童事業的人士，經費大部份來自捐助。總會裏還聘請專家分赴各該分會視導，規劃一切，改進活動的方針，收效之大，不亞於中小學的教育。這是值得我們效法的。此外兒童電影和兒童廣播兩大新事業，也有大規模創設的必要。在大都市裏的電化教育，它的客觀條件比較完備。戰後都市人口密集，建築物缺少，更需要這種電化教育的新工具，來補救學校教育上空間和時間的不足，把教材搬上銀幕，或把教學過程在空間中播送，把這二件密切的配合起來，便可使大量兒童，隨時隨地享受更便利的教育。總之，這種電化教育的新工具，可以擴大教育的領域和設施。所以電化教育的組織是最新型的兒童事業。在美國和英國這種事業大都爲私人企業，在政府贊助和商業競爭的條件下，努力推進；並且在質量方面，益臻完備，更值得我們效法的。</p>
<p>上海市是中華民國兒童節的誕生地，賢明的前進的工商企業家，對於兒童新事業認識正確，過去已有過若干輝煌的成績，在我國兒童事業發展史上，啟示我們更加信任上海市絕不會退居人後。際此勝利第二年的兒童節，一切建設在邁步前進中，作者十二分希望，在兒童節的誕生地，對於上述兩大新兒童事業，來一個推進運動，到明年的兒童節慶祝會的節目裏，醬油無數空中兒童學校，廣播慶祝節目，無數兒童教育電影或是教材，輪流到各校各廣場放映。這是在今天的慶祝聲裏，必須倡導儘速使之實現的。</p>
<p>近代的先進國家都認為兒童福利事業的建設和推進，非成立一個研究總匯的機關，不足以資統一而收宏效。所以在各大都市，往往有兒童局與兒童幸福委員會等的組織，威化頑劣兒童，救濟窮苦孩子，由當地政府負責辦理，自屬要圖。作者顧我當局也考慮到這一點，非但是兒童的福音。並且是民族國家的大幸！</p>

<h3>德政治組織問題　交調整委會處理　四外長原則上已獲協議　美蘇可能就德賠償問題獲致妥協</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科二日電〕西國外長會議木日討診德國政治組織問題，在原則上巳成立協議，主張將德國政治組織分爲四個階段：（一）設立中央行政機構；（二）設立諮詢委員會；（三）制定臨時憲法及設立臨時政府；（四）起草德國織法。但各國代表對於其他問題，意見仍極給歧。美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥提議主張將此事　交柏林盟國管制委員會處理，爲各國代表所否決，旋即由英國外相貝文提議，主張將此事移交調整委員會加以整理，然後再向外長會議拱出報告，此一提議，黨即爲四國外長會議所通過。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日廣播：馬歇爾頃在莫斯科宣佈美方願意考慮關於德國賠償問題之折衷方案，易言之，即美方同竟自德國現行生產中，取得有限度之賠償。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科三日電〕美國今日在四强會議席上，準備與蘇妥協。美國務卿馬歇爾，對德國賠懷問題，據權威方面透露，業已準備作一項妥協之建議，即在德國經濟臻於自給之基礎後，接受自德現行生產中提取賠款之原則是也。馬歇爾自願在今日之會議席上，將此項計劃流露，隨後或將予以公開披露。據悉：該計劃包括；（一）對德國工業水準提高作若干決定，此將使根據波茨坦方式可搬移作賠償之用之國工廠數目更少，（二）馬歇爾由於使德國工業計劃有較高之水準，將允許自該若干保持不移動之工廠提取若干生產，供賠償之用；（三）馬歇爾將堅持在此項貽償提取前，德國就必需之進口上言之，應臻於自給之基礎，並應償付盟國迄今爲止所用於使德免去飢餓之費用。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科四日廣播：四强外長自展幕迄今，業已數週，因意見分歧，毫無成就，今則已近尾聲矣。英法方面預料會議可於十三日結束，美代表團則謂最早須至十五日始能閉幕。馬歇爾立塲，依然堅强，密使此次會議失敗，而決不對蘇穌讓步。英法外長對此表示憂慮，彼等認爲若空手返國，必無以應付其對黨也。其中尤以法外長皮杜爾之地位，更爲困窘。今日外長會議開會時，將討論决要問題，如肅淸納粹，使德國民主化等問題。</p>
<h3>戰時兩項協定引起重大糾葛</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科二日電〕外長會議目前爭取協議，顯己因波茨坦與雅爾達二協定而大增糾葛。美國務卿馬歇爾公開承認各外長現雖嘗試依照波茨坦協定進行磋商，但累月以來久知波茨坦宣言字面之鬆懈含糊，實易產生各種截然不同之解釋。對各國而言，該協定幾乎人各一說。四大國均援引協定，證已爲是，斥人之非。馬氏嘗謂，「對蘇聯而言，波茨坦協定會規定價值百億美元之各式賠償，且得自德國現行生產中抽取賠償。對美英而言，波茨坦協定並未規定自現行生產中抽取賠償，而雅爾達協定中之百億美元之數則已失效。對英蘇而言，波茨坦協定曾謂德國中央機構應由德人主持，但對法國而言，該協定僅謂在四強管制下設立中央機構。法國對於德國設立中央機構之時期與方式仍多別解，結果德國不能有經濟統一。又蘇聯認爲德境英美佔領區合倂違反協定，應予發止。英美則認爲此項合倂在協定範圍之內。世代相傳，各方均將指波茨坦雅兩達二協定中任何一點作爲他國背信之明騐矣。故除非吾人眞能傾心會商且確欲覆行協定之文字與精神，不如無協定爲愈」。觀乎馬氏聲明不急於作草率決議一節，足徽渠將避免再蹈粗製濫造之　轍。</p>
<h3>克萊返柏林</h3>

<p>〔本報南京三日電〕京滬車二日下午五時四十分，由滬開京之五十八次京滬四等慢車，於三日下午一時半，駛經丹陽鎮江之間，陵口站東分又時，機車車輸突然出軌，轟然一聲，全部機車隨即出軌，客車二輛，亦被拽出傾覆。據陵口車站調查結果，報稱在該路綦右軌失却堅韌性，兩軌不能平衡，致釀此禍。今晨京滬間車僅能開抵鎮江左右，京方九十兩次客車，均未開出，至十一時京方爲解決客人擁擠，特增開京鎮間臨時區間車一决，下午即告恢復。各次車均有誤點。</p>

<p>傳訊證明。孟誔長續詢被告梅斯伯，據供：謝會計師核賬報告書上，所載電匯，信匯數目，大致相符，可以同意。埃勃斯公司經營電信匯較多，現款交易甚少，二月十七日以後僅賣出現貨美鈔一千八百三十九元，在紐約置進電匯後，在滬付出法幣。港幣有存款二萬元一筆，餘未做過，黃金曾由美國購進，香港售出，在滬未做過。至於公司中保管箱中，皆係代客戶保管物件，康派斯</p>

<h3>發起世界兒童互助運動　兒童帮助兒童</h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>今天我很誠懇地要向全國敎師，全國兒童說幾句話。際此師範敎育運動週而且是兒童節的常兒，各位敎師，一定會想到如何敎育兒童。關於這個問題，本人建議我們做敎師的做父母的來創導一種兒童敎育運動，—兒童互助運動。我們做敎師的不但要敎兒童自助，並且也要敎兒童互助。兒童怎互助呢？</p>
<p>八年的抗戰，總算是結束了，現在我們所迫切期待的，就是如何建立世界和平。世界和平的建立，固然有賴於程濟的，政治的種種問題，但全世界的兒童能够了解和平，實行互助，是很重要的。</p>
<p>兒童如何互助？我建議由全上海的兒童發起，來向全國的兒童，全世界的兒童，做個懇切的呼籲，共同組織一個世界兒童互助會今日中國兒童大多數是非常不幸的，他們沒有飯讀，需要帮助沒有衣穿，需要帮助，甚至文化知識方面，也需要帮助，內地的兒童尤其需要帮助。我們不妨用通訊，禮物，文字的東西如讀物等，寄給內地的兒童，向他們了解上海的兒童，並且我們還可以發起這種運動，不僅使內地的兒童知道上海兒童的情形，而且使上海的兒童也能知道內地的兒童；不使上海與內地的兒童互相了解而已，而且還可以使各地的兒童都能互相了解；不僅是了解各地兒童的情形而已，而且還可以了解各地的一切事情。這樣，兒童互助，其效果是非常宏大的。上海兒童與內地兒童可以這般做，即上海兒童與國外兒童亦未始不可這般做。</p>
<p>最近，我的小孩子從美國西部來信說起，美國兒童很想了解中國兒業，但是他們可憐得很，由於中國人在那邊的不多，又沒有人指導他們，所以他們的文化箱中，關於中國的，只有一些小脚的鞋十，織子，和一些瓷器，很明顯的，這些東西，決不能代表今日的中國，因此，如何使他們了解中國，意義很大。</p>
<p>假如每個兒童都能捐助一點東西，那麼，我們上海二十萬兒童，就可以做成許多個文化箱，把這些文化箱送給美國兒童，使他們了解我們這邊的情形，或者是送給英國，法國，蘇聯，不僅是歐美各國，我們也可以送給亞洲各國的兒童，使印度的兒童，緬甸，暹羅的兒童也能知道中國兒童，使中外小朋友聯繫起來，其意義是多麼的偉大。</p>
<p>近來，我們時常在報上看到暹羅，菲律賓等地排華，爲什麼他們要排華呢？原因就是他們不明暸中國的情形。如果互相能够了解，則間題一定要簡單了許多。上海的小朋友應當趕快組織起來，我們要跟印度，緬甸，還羅，菲律實，及各國的小朋友們取得聯繫，彼此互相愛護，互相帮助，則對世界和平運動，定有很大貢獻。</p>
<p>敎師的責任，就是使兒童互助，我們不僅教一個兒童能够互助，而且要敎一切的兒童都能友助，要使上海的兒童與全國的兒童取得聯繁，與全世界的兒童取得聯緊，以擴展世界和平運動。但如何推農兒童互助運動，全靠我們敎師的努力。上海敎師，團結起來，推動兒童互助運動！</p>
<p>我們要使有錢的兒童帮助貧苦的兒童，使學問高的兒童帮助學問低的兒童，使在學的兒童帮助失學的兒童，這一切都需要我們敎師來發動。要知道敎師並不是敎書敎得好就算完了，主要的是要敎兒童自己來做。世界大戰後的第一件世界大事，就是世界和平運動，敎師應當負起責任來，把此運動從上海推向各地，從中國推向外國，其實外國兒童早己開始互助運動，在兩個月之前，上海幼稚師範附小的小朋友們，就曾收到美國加利福尼亞一個學校小朋友們的文化箱，這個學校只有幾十個小朋友，但他們竟捐集了很多書籍送給中國小朋友，我曉得美國國內其他各地的小朋友，也己這樣送文化箱到世界各國兒童了。上海兒童決不能落後，我們應和全國谷地兒童互助，和全世界各國兒童互助！</p>
<p>乘此第十六屆兒童節，又是本屆師範敎育目運動週的最後一天，發動兒童互助運動，使全世界的兒童都能互諒，互信，互尊，互助，則中國固可得到永久和平，即全世界也可以得到永久和平。</p>

<p>麵粉因內地高昂零化轉暢，續加千餘元。麩皮去化接連，價格續昂三五百元。豆餅供求萬不見旺，形趨平正之格。黃豆漲定之狀，菉豆彷彿，赤豆帶挺千元，苞米似昨，紅糧原　，芝蔴挺住，生仁消化動而不旺，惟客心尚堅，步砌二三千元。小麥盤升一二千元。</p>
<p>油市巳入大漲小回之勢，生油下挫萬元，豆油亦跌五千元，蔴油疲落二三千元淸油亦然平正。</p>
<h3>糖市略見回緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市路見面緊，升萬元至一·二千元不一。公會劃聲，秘潘細砂最高爲二十五萬一千元，最低二十三萬七千元，收聲廿五萬元，升萬餘元。四半車白升二三千元，三半車白升五六千元。二四粗白高貨升萬元，潮貨僅升一二千元。台赤現貨平平，棧單升四五千元。台糖公司昨屆標售之期，價格照舊，約開三萬包。四半自計二成，三半白五成，二四粗自三成。土糖無甚變動，海南赤十三萬八千元，成交百餘包。興化糖原價開二百件。</p>
<h3>桐油出口四千噸　新貨塲價下挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據此間某行商云：最近由上海輸出桐油，截至昨日止，共計四千噸左右，輸往歐洲者，計桶裝桐油三千噸，輸往美國者，計散裝桐油一千噸。止决桐油，均係以前訂購，目前桐油對外交易，以價格不符，尚無承做可能。昨市大市面做開爲每擔卅八萬元，數量甚小，漢口市價每擔爲卅二萬元，各產區以新貨登塲，價均相繼下降中。</p>
<h3>華股雖見漲風　游資仍多觀望</h3>
<p>華股昨買風因外股市塲被澈查而被激動，中途異常堅俏，惟因業外游資仍在觀望，漲勢未能持久，散多咸起失望。午後堅後突疲，掉期因空頭及銀行帮紛加掉空，貼價自四〇元退至三〇元，合日息不到六分。</p>
<p>晨開時已見堅定，遞永紗上塲即聲高至二日八〇元。旋又因售戶躍踴微降至二三三〇元。然因現交永紗極爲堅定，一八五號等相繼購買，逐漸盤高，十一時一刻，扳高至二五〇〇元大關。此時中法，火柴，麗安，美亞，商務决第漲達限度，一〇四號二一五號逢高有拋而略聲，迨十一時三刻後，樞面見涸，遞永紗乃漲達二五七〇元高俱。近午二一八號一一七號稍有了結而微回。結果較前收計信和漲一成强，永紗新光新華華豐各漲一成弱，美亞中法漲停。遞交計永紗信和美亞華豐各升一成有零，新光漲一成，冷股麗安火柴商務漲停，大通景綸永公各漲一成强，水泥榮豐成交不多獨平，餘者微升迄半成强不等。</p>
<p>午後上塲尚俏，火柴美亞等漲停者有六種之多，於是逢高了結，賣風忽盛。傳美金公債本市將被攤派九成之訊，人心見怯而步降至二四三五元。但有人趁低維持，回升至二四九〇元。嗣又被一〇五號等賣至二四五〇元光景，雖有一七一號等購納，仍被賣風所壓倒，遞永紗降低至二四〇〇元·九七號一一七號二號一七九號來進，臨收稍回，結果較前收計永紗信和漲半成光景。美亞升一成不到，新光華豐新華微升，勤興平平，中法漲停。遞交計永紗信和漲半成强，新光華豐微漲，美亞漲一成弱，冷股商務水泥火柴漲停後有回，麗安漲停，榮豐跌半成，中紡統益景論永公各漲半成强，內衣微降，餘告微升。塲外各股俱告微升。</p>
<h3>統債交易稀</h3>
<p>公債昨仍在徘徊成交不到五百萬元。業中五一二室五五五室五五二室有進，五五一室五四四室則出。統丙晨開一一七〇〇元，高價一三二〇〇元，低價一一五〇〇元，臨收稍升，結果較前收各債均形平穩，收後復升高至一三六〇〇元以上。</p>
<h3>查抄對講電話　外股一度停市</h3>
<p>外股昨十一時前因剪對講電話之舉，影響會告停市。迨澈查人員離去，始進行賣買。怡紗自三一七〇〇元升至三二二〇〇元，而後回落至三〇三〇〇元轉盤。結果較前收計英聯紙業平平，餘者榮辱互見，銀行帮廣幫有納，證券帮則有出　，橡皮股仍屬買盤居多。</p>

<h3>認眞養兒子</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>倫敦三十日廣播，有一篇關於英格蘭與威爾斯人口的統計。其中說到嬰孩數目二十四年來已第一次超過「接防標準」，充滿着樂觀的口氣。看看整篇所列的數字，令人驚異英國人對於養兒子的認眞。</p>
<p>「不孝有三，無後爲大，這是我們幾千年來的古話。到了民國初年，在打倒孔家店的高潮之中，有人提倡非孝，說「父母並非有意養我」的話，於是「無後」的古語，在一般知識階層中乃被完全否定了。可是過了若干年以後，這話又被若干優生學者發掘出來認爲大有道理：中國之所以不亡，而仍舊得爲地大物博，尤其人衆的泱泱大國者實在得力於此種光前裕後的思想不小。四萬五千萬確乎是一種力量。我們應該謝謝傳下這句話來的孟老夫子，於此可見西洋人對於生男育女的認眞態度，我們中國原是古已有之的了。再看一看我們左親右鄰養兒子努力，更可以知道我們是在怎樣遵循着這句古訓。</p>
<p>現在可惜的是我們對於嬰孩出生並沒有如西洋人那樣的統計，我們的人口數字也像三字經一樣念了幾十年至今沒有變。一個本子上說四萬萬，一個本十上說四萬五千萬，再沒有第三種新版本了，那末我們所謂「無後爲大」者究竟「大」到什麼地方去了呢？</p>
<p>常走南去路的人，大槪都看過一個女丐；十餘年如一日，她常常跪在行人道上求乞。最初是一個單身女人，後來多一個「臘燭包」的嬰孩，這個孩子大了，又多一個「臘燭包」。第二個孩子大了，又來第三個「臘燭包」。於是較大的孩子也令跟在行人後面求乞了。於是孩子的數目就保持在三四個的左右。「臘燭包」常常出現，而大孩子却不再增加。道女丐的丈夫大概也是一個「無後爲大」的孝子。他的本領却是努力生男育女而男女數目並不繼續增加那一點神秘，正如我們的四萬萬成四萬五千萬一樣。有人說如果不太　力，這個數目恐怕要减退下去，那就　令人不解了。</p>
<h3>「借米還米」——農夫阿寳米窮困記</h3>
<p>— 夢平</p>
<p>「阿寳米」是近上海西郊的二十里的一個村上的農夫，他是獨生兒子，生下的時候，父母很愛他，喚他爲阿寳米；附近的人，不論老幼，都喊他爲阿寳米。</p>
<p>阿寳米是種十四畝田的自耕晨，他的田都近自己的住宅，他有母親妻子和兩個孩子，他的妻子能帮他種田，插秧·耕種·挑担，什麼都會，他的十三歲的女兒能割草管牛，有時割些薺菜，金花菜等野菜之類回家作菜看。一切的勞力，不要求人，省吃儉用，一家生活，融融樂樂。</p>
<p>前年夏天，阿寳米病了。求神拜佛，道士捉鬼，請醫請巫，打針吃藥；這樣，他的經濟就發生了變化，不得不寅吃卯糧，借貸度日。</p>
<p>「借米還米」，一借麥還麥」，這是近數年京滬杭一帶農民的借貸方式。農民不懂得通貨膨賬，不懂得通貨膨脹根本的原因是打內戰；祗知道貨物會慢慢的上漲，紙幣會漸漸的不值錢，債主吃了「借錢還錢」的苦，漸漸養成了「借物還物」的習慣。阿害米不能例外，開始「借米還米」。</p>
<p>廢曆年底，阿寳米沒有錢過年，於是向陳家借米一石，賣米買菜。廢曆新正十五日，夫妻二人扛了一石米還給了陳家。有人問：「爲什麽還得這樣快？」陳家答：「他是借別人的米來還的，長久借了，不好意思，只得借甲還乙，借丙還甲，輾轉借還，度到新榖登塲。」（這樣可省付利息）「廢曆年前就須借米，到新職登塲時還掉，再到廢曆年底，不是又要借米嗎？」「是的，越借越窮，不是他一個人，有的在新穀登塲時就沒有米吃了」「將來大槪要賣田吧？」「唔！說不定。」</p>
<p>自耕農將淪爲半目耕農的阿寳米，近日性情有些變動。怨恨着命運，怨恨着妻子，有時爲了小小的事情，夫妻亦要「口角」。</p>
<h3>邏輯不錯</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>母親—「喂，小龍，你記住了，在我放餅的那口黑暗的橱裹，有一個鬼躭着。」</p>
<p>小龍—「眞寄怪，每逢少了餅，你從來不怪那個鬼，你總是怪我。」</p>
<h3>舉國　若狂　—記一個故事</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>這是一個遠在六朝時代流傳下來的故事：</p>
<p>「昔有一國，國中一水，號曰在泉，國人飲此水，無不在者。惟國君穿井而汲，獨無恙。國人旣並在，反謂國主之不狂爲在，於是聚謀，共執國主療其在疾，火艾鋮藥，莫不畢具。主不任其苦，亦到泉所，酌水飲之，飲畢便在。君臣大小，其狂若一，衆乃權然！」</p>
<p>這個故事，雖則簡單，却也非常有趣。一班在人，不日知其在，反而說不狂者爲在。弄得是非顛倒，眞僞莫辨，滑稽之至！</p>
<p>最可笑的，就是自己明明不在，但人家偏要說你病在，於是「火艾鏚藥」，强迫施治，那痛苦是實在吃不消的。</p>
<p>好比那位國主，尚不失爲一個聽明的人，他自知堅持無益，不願意再吃許多冤枉苦頭，便也一飲在泉，「其在如一」。於是衆情融治，舉國狂灌！這樣兩全其美的事，眞是何樂而不爲呢！</p>
<h3>敎職員生活費</h3>
<p>— 天地人</p>
<p>報載敎部爲安定「內地」學校敎職員生活，曾計劃乏給平·津·京·滬·迪化等地以外敎職員生活補助費，俾使其薪給與上述五地者相同，以杜絕過去人才向大都會集中之偏枯現象。這一問題，在「原則」上當然「甚善」，不過「辦法」如何，還有待於政院會同敎部擬具出來。</p>
<p>目前敎職員生活費，除少數特殊區域外，大多可憐得很！就以隣接滬市，屢擬併入市區迄未實現的上海縣論，國民學校敎職員最高底薪七十元，補助費基本數七萬五千元，四百四十倍，計十萬零五千八百七十元，雖政府明令自本年一月份起，調整待遇，規定裝本書十一萬元，七百五十倍，大約增加五萬餘元，但事實上一月份仍是老標準，口惠而實不至；幷且本學期開學以來，分文未發，那簡直連老標準都無法領到了，寗非怪事。</p>
<p>據說縣政府預算，只列少數幾個中心國民學校，至於多數非中心國民學校的經費，將責令鄉保長負責籌措，如果這樣，不特跡近苛擾，更十足表現政府對敎育事業的無辦法了。况在開始籌措以前，還須經過民意機講的立法程序，再經呈省核准以後，才能着手籌措，籌措起來，是否能如理想中的順利和容易？籌措以後，如何保管和運用？萬一進行遲滯，綏不濟急，是否忍令敎職員們枵腹從公？這些都是頗「傷腦筋」的事。（報載：蘇省敎育家甘允壽已具呈敎部反對矣。）</p>
<p>敎部要安定敎職員生活，自是歡天喜地的事，不過事已迫切，樓梯響了，但願人即下來。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>劇團希望借到的卡車，到現在爲止，還是毫無眉目，××長官公署的負責人雖曾表示過到必需撤退的時候，他們可以容許老祝和全體團員跟軍隊同走，可是他看到上前綫去增援的部隊交通工具如此缺乏，差不多十次有九次是步行的，那就使他不敢想像撤退時的情形了。還有蘭和兩個孩子，走的問題也並不曾解決。自從徐紹明的太太打柳州回來之後，他們住在徐家眞不比火綫上舒服。那位又搜又高的山東太太一天到晚拉直了嗓子，逢人開腔；要不是蘭對徐紹明的態度是那樣的厭惡和冷淡，這位太太早就打翻酸罐，鬧得落花流水了。</p>
<p>蘭已經決心不再等候那筆遙遙無期的劃款了，可是她也從未請木徐紹明或祝兆年替她設法車位；對於前者，她是不屑請敎，對於後者，又有些不敢請敎。</p>
<p>滿想對她大獻殷勤的小沈，本有一個幻想，希望自己能够單獨弄到一輛小包車，載着蘭和緋緋榮兒直放貴陽。可是前天徐紹明太太一到，他的活動便受了限制，那位又瘦又高，走路像男人一樣的徐總經理太太竟以全力監視着他，比監視她自己的丈夫還認眞，十分鐘不見，便拉直嗓子，操着山東口音，不停嘴的喊「小沈，小沈」，使小沈聽了，不由不心胆俱裂。他深深地懊悔不該在柳州乘一時的高興，勾上了這一位母夜叉。同時，他，小沈，一個有着電影明星那樣外型的大少爺，在這時候的桂林，實在不能像諸協理和徐紹明一樣約有辦法；盡他所有的力量，要在四個國家銀行向湘桂鐵路所包的鐵篷車上想法弄兩三個人站站的地位，也許還可以辦到，然而小包車就沒有他染指的希望了。在碰了三四次軟硬不同的釘子之後，他只能乖乖地息下了這條心念，雖然每次看到蘭，他總還禁不住要搭訕幾句。</p>
<p>這兩三天來，蘭自己奔走得很忙，她去找過一個以前美專時候的同學，—現在是省政府的黃秘書太太，和另一位蘭自己的堂兄，湘桂路局裏的一名中級職員。那位秘書太太不忘其舊，居然答應把蘭的一家從省政府的便船上帶到蒙山去，可是這和蘭的目的不同，只能婉謝了她的美意。那位堂兄是位窮公務員，但還完整地保留着一顆人的心，他給蘭費了九牛二虎之力，買到兩張上柳州去的頭等票，可是好幾决都上不了車，因爲大部份的火宣都被調去趕運軍隊，預定可以開出的客車臨時都取消了。（三四）</p>
<h3>三毛在兒童節</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>兒童節</h3>
<p>— 范泉</p>
<p>我想，我們新生小學的陸校長，是全世界最最肥胖的人了，但是他偏偏穿了一身又短又小的中山裝，脚管祗拖在小腿上，領口的鈕子綳得那麼緊，把他胖喉嚨的皮肉都擠到外面來了。只要在他說話的時候，為了領口太緊，有些不舒服，他總要用他胖胖的右手，把領口拉一拉，撳一撳，然後把頭頸很快的一縮，把唾沫嚥了嚥，抬一抬頭，然後才說話。每次碰到陸校長說話，我是多麼的着急：不要把那領口的鈕子綳壞了啊！</p>
<p>譬如今天，陸校長又在嚥唾沬了，因此我又在着急了，但是我屛住了氣，靜靜的看着。只見他縮一縮頭頸，再抬一抬頭，用他的「標準國語」向我們說：</p>
<p>「各位這個小朋友：今天這個今天，是四月四日，是這個兒童節。這個這個，兒童節，就是這個兒童的節日。而這個兒童的節日，一年這個裏面，這個這個，僅僅祗有這個一天啊，僅僅祗有這個，四月四日。所以本校，所以這個本校長，為了這個兒童節，為了你們這個小朋友，今天陪你們去這個玩玩。今天這個公園裏頭呀，是不要錢的，但是，私人的公園，這個這個，如果小朋友這個衣冠不整潔，那就是說，衣服太骯髒這個的，那是，就要這個——不准進去的。但是本校，但是這個本校長，可以向一切人担保，可以向這個一切的一切的這個担保，本校的小朋友，都是這個講究淸潔的，所以這個這個本校長，前天已經接洽了這個愛儷園去玩，接洽了世界大戲院去看電影，唉，嗯，這個這個，看電影，看這個的這個，看這個電影這個的。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，我捫的陸校長儘伸頭頸，儘嚥唾沫，儘用他的胖手在他的領口那兒一拉一撳的。噢唷，我眞担心呀，那領口那兒的鈕子不要「　」的一聲，飛了出去呀，但是我希望飛了出去立刻飛回來，飛在他的領口上，像一隻蒼蠅一樣，只要兜了一個圈子，仍舊躱到原來的地方，這樣好叫陸校長再說下去呀。</p>
<p>可是陸校長再也說不下去了，他伸伸頭頸，縮縮頭頸，再也「這個」不下去了。那末不「這個」又怎麼辦呢？難道呌我們陪着陸校長呆坐「這個」一天麼？</p>
<p>幸好體育先生姜先生走到講台上來了，他站在陸校長的旁邊，接下去說：</p>
<p>「好啦，剛才校長先生的話，你們都聽見啦，現在我們開始出發，先遊愛儷園，再在兩點半鐘到世界大戲院裏去看電影。那末現在就出發，校長的意思怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「這個這個……」陸校長點了點頭，表示他的同意。</p>
<p>於是我們排了隊，打學校裹走出來了。</p>
<p>當我們的隊伍快到愛儷園的時候，小狗子看見了我，他大聲的喊——</p>
<p>「戚小花！」</p>
<p>我回過頭去，看見了那個拖着鼻涕，赤着脚，在馬路上丟磚頭的小狗子。小狗子是我們的鄰居，他的爸爸是泥水匠，部是赤了脚，一早就出門，到了深夜才回來，回來的時候滿身是泥灰，有時候臉上塗了一塊塊花白的石灰。小鉻子的媽媽在我們家裏帮傭。所以小鉻子常常到我們家裏來，和我一塊兒玩，有時候我還敎小鉻子識字，做了小狗子的小先生。</p>
<p>今天看見了小狗子，我是多麼的高興啊！我向小狗子招了招手，小狗子立刻跑過來了。</p>
<p>小狗子並着我的肩膀，和我一塊兒走。</p>
<p>我有意壓低了聲督，向小狗子說：</p>
<p>「喂，小狗子，你知不知道，今天是兒童節呀！」</p>
<p>小狗子呆了呆，他想了好一會，正正經經地向我問：</p>
<p>「什麼叫耳捅節呢—桶就沒有節嗎？我看見爸爸的泥水桶，用木頭做的，也都有節的。」</p>
<p>「唉，小狗子，你連兒童節也不懂麼？」我有些可憐小狗子了，我低聲的說，「兒童節就是我們小朋友的好日子呀！」</p>
<p>「可是我沒有進學校，爸爸沒有錢，我只能做野孩子，我不是你們的『小朋友』！」</p>
<p>我聽了小狗子的話很難過，但是我安慰小狗子，我說：</p>
<p>「小孩子都是小朋友，小朋友在今天都要過好日子！」</p>
<p>「怎樣的好日子呢？」</p>
<p>「玩花園，看電影。」</p>
<p>「我也跟你們一樣的可以進去麼？」</p>
<p>「一樣可以進去。」</p>
<p>小狗子聽呀聽的，快活得不得了，他跳跳蹦蹦的，攙住我的手，就擠在我的前面，排到我們的隊伍裏了。</p>
<p>這時候我們的隊伍已走到了愛儷園的大門口。陸校長和姜先生叫我們站住，他們走到大門口去，和那守門的人幾咕了一會，然後姜先生走過來了，他站在我們隊伍的前面，委用力地喊：</p>
<p>「立正—向右轉—報数！」</p>
<p>聽到了姜先生大聲吆喝，小狗子赫呆了，他立刻偸偸地挪動着脚，走到隊伍的外面，像一個過路的孩子一樣，好奇地眺望着我們。</p>
<p>報數完畢，姜先生就又發出了號令：</p>
<p>「向左轉—開步走！」</p>
<p>於是三十六個小朋友都走過愛儷園的大門框了。</p>
<p>獨有小狗子，他呆呆的，站在大門邊，目送着我們一個一個的走進花園的大門框。</p>
<p>我們的隊伍是解散了，小朋友們三三兩兩的分批到池子邊，到假山裏去玩，我滿肚子的氣：為什麼不讓小狗子也進來一同玩玩喲？</p>
<p>到　　　鐘的時候，姜先生吹起口　　把小朋友們集　來，排成隊伍，走出愛儷園，走向世界大戲院裏看電影去。</p>
<p>隊伍經過福煦路亞爾培路轉角的時候，小狗子又偸偸地走到我的旁邊來了。他有些埋怨似的說：</p>
<p>「我在外面等，你們為什麼玩得這麼久呀？」</p>
<p>我滿肚子的慚愧，我有什麼話要向小狗子說呢？我為什麽不向姜先生要求，讓小狗子也進來？我為什麼……我想來想去，總覺得太對不起小狗子了，我於是說：</p>
<p>「小狗子，看電影去，這一回你別怕，和我一塊兒進去！」</p>
<p>小狗子聽了我的話，就感動得臉也紅起來了，他立刻用自己的眼，打量了一下自己的衣服，就半信半疑地問我：</p>
<p>「眞的麼？」</p>
<p>「眞的！」我直截爽快的回答。</p>
<p>於是小狗子又插到我們的隊伍裏來了。這一次他排在我後面。我不時回過頭去和他談話。我看見小狗子小心冀翼的走着，他用袖口抹去了那兩條老鼻涕，再甩手掌拍去了身上的泥灰，從小狗子的舉動上，我看到小狗子是多麼的感到自信和愉快啊。</p>
<p>隊伍在世界大戲院的門前站住了。當陸校長「這個這個」地和收票員交涉了一會以後，我們便按照排齊的隊伍，一個一個的走到戲院子裏去。</p>
<p>收票員點着人數：「一個，兩個……」</p>
<p>當我快要通過收票員面前的時候，兩個收票員幾乎同時大聲地怒吼——</p>
<p>「哼！你這小癟三！」</p>
<p>我回過頭來看，只見兩個收票員用四雙有力的手，抓住了小狗子的襤褸衣服的領口，把他從隊伍裏拖出，狠狠地打着耳光。當他傘把小狗子拖到戲院門口石階的地方，其中的一個收票員，用他的右腿，向小狗子的屁股上狠命地踢了一脚，小狗子便哇的一聲，哭着哭着，像一根紅蘿蔔似的，連跌帶滾地從八級石階上滾下來，，一直滾到了馬路上。</p>
<p>我急忙跑出去，跑到小狗子的旁邊，把哭着的小狗子扶起來。我連連的說：「他是我的小朋友，他是我的小朋友！」</p>
<p>這時候，陸校長和姜先生也趕到我的旁邊來，姜先生拉住了我的手，板起了臉說：</p>
<p>「他是小癟三，他不是我們的小朋友！」</p>
<p>我聽了這樣的話非常不高興，我就說：</p>
<p>「他是我的鄰居小朋友，我要他一塊兒去看電影。」</p>
<p>「這個這個，」那個大胖子陸校長也着急得連連用胖手摸領口，「這個這個，他没有資格去看這個電影這個的！」</p>
<p>「為什麼呢？」我哭喪着臉說：「為什麼呢？——今天不是兒童節麼？今天不是全世界的小朋友們都可以一塊兒地玩麼？今天不是……」</p>
<p>「這個這個，兒童節是這個兒童節，不過這個——那個兒童節，可不是這個兒童節……」</p>
<p>陸校長和姜先生把我拖我戲院子裏去，可是我為了「兒童節」，為了我們的這個好日子，却禁不住放聲大哭起來了。</p>

<p>哈哈，你們覺得我們討厭，</p>
<p>所發的問題不値半文錢，也就啞口無言！</p>
<p>給孩子們　莊村</p>
<p>我，一個失去了土地的耕種者，像一隻折翅的鳥，跌落在你們生活的草原上，我是知道自己很難再翔翔於藍天了，於是；你們的草原，便成了我底家。</p>
<p>我一跨進你們王國的門檻，便驚訝而懊悔於往日，往日，那一串不是生活的生活，磨折了我，使世故和虛偽，塵封起我的情感．使我捧起被侮辱與踐踏的靈魂啜泣。而這次，寄憩於你們情感的搖籃邊，看到你們眞正的純潔和坦白，天眞和無私，我浸溶於眼淚的良心，又含笑的順到童年了。</p>
<p>你們——人間的燈光和花朶呵！世界上怎麼能少掉你們？正如我少不掉人間眞摯的情感來洗亮我灰暗的生命，即或我一個失去了土地的耕種者，一個縮了觸角的蝸牛，而生活在你們這塊綠色的土地上，也喜悅的搓一搓繭疤的手，流汗地舉起了鋤頭呀！</p>
<p>而我，也再不像往日，眼睛追逐着流逝的白雲，嘴裏嚼着空虛與寂寞的苦果，躑躅在秋日的荒林，抬着殘缺的落葉，低吟着耋底失恋詩呀！因為在耕種上，我是有了收獲的希望，而在情感上，我有了希望的收穫；我理想的播種機，又滾動於這受孕的田地了。</p>
<p>但在這顫動的古老的土地上，人呵！都是像海洋上的一葉小船，隨時在受着風浪的顚播和吹打，一週前，隨着風雨襲擊的日子，我作了一個短暫地握別你們，握咖你們的萌芽的泥土，而你們，竟以為我不再回來，你們的肯淚，隨着雨點淋濕了我的行囊，也淋濕了我底心，當我走得很遠很遠再回頭時，你們一羣幼小的送行者，竟還痴立在雨天裏，像一羣失了母鷄的小木鷄。……而當我又重回到你們的面前時，你們又像蜂羣一樣；簇擁在我的周圍。……</p>
<p>哎！我又何嘗願意離開你們，今天，我已感到，離開你們是一件不可能的殘忍的事了。但有什麽辦法哩？我飛起又落下，落下又飛起。……</p>
<p>今天，我是背起了你們交給的沉重的情感，沉重最離開你們，離開你們，我是有一小份離開林巢飛出尋食的母鳥的愉快，我是有一大份航海人張帆開船的愉快；但我是更有一份又失去了土地的耕種者底傷懷呵！</p>
<p>不要再為我流下那亮晶晶的珍珠的眼淚了，不要祝福我平安地出去，又平安地歸來吧！當我浪跡在異鄕，不管我是有沒有獲得一塊耕種的土地，我是要獲得你們土地上收割的消息的，我是永遠要唱着這塊土地上底萌芽之歌的。……</p>
<h3>祝兒童節</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>年年此日播新音，又是兒童佳節臨，花發水流機並活，鳶飛魚躍趣同深，無窮生意陽春脚，不染點塵赤子心；建國有懷期下代，驊騮未壯已駸駸。</p>
<h3>談兒童美術敎育</h3>
<p>記得一九三六年六月六日，在江灣新市區的體育塲——全國兒童年實施委員會為「提倡兒童美術敎育」，特委託市敎育局暨中華藝術敎育社，中華慈幼協會等七個團體，籌辦了一個「全國兒童美術展覽會」，出品有二十四個單位，作品總計四萬餘件，洋洋大觀，琳瑯滿目，想不到竟成為空前絕後的壯舉！</p>
<p>直至今日，十易寒暑，雖說為了八年的抗戰，一切都淪於停頓和毀滅，但，最後的勝利終於到臨了，一切的一切都高呼着「復員」，「復興」，「廷設」的口號了，惟有「兒童的美術敎育」，簡直就無人提過一字半句，這該是多末遺憾的事啊！</p>
<p>「美術敎育」，被實施到小學，將近二十年，過去雖說缺點甚多，難以盡愜人意，但，較之目前的氣象則蓬勃得多了。</p>
<p>「美術」對於兒童性靈的啓發，具有極大的功能——它不但是表現人類應有的愛美的天性，而且可以陶冶噁劣的性情；它不但能養成創造的習慣，而且可以增進良善的德行。這些這些都是兒童本身不可能發覺，也決不去應用的，因此，不得不提出以下幾個意見，供獻拾敎育兒童的負責人。</p>
<p>「兒童美術敎育」，第一要使兒童怎樣去欣賞美和啓發兒童審美的興趣？要做到無形的美的敎育，必須在兒童日常生活的周圍，佈置出一個美的環境。——衣，食，住，行乃至學校和敎室以及他兒童們所需要的玩具，我們都得切實的注意，因為這都是足以增長兒童對於美的欣賞和識別程度的。</p>
<p>舉個例來說：衣裳不需料子好，祗要肅式合身，清潔就是美，食物不在乎多，祗要吃的份量與時間地點有規律，有禮貌也就是美………這些這些都是需要敎育兒童的父母師長去安排和誘導的。</p>
<p>第二要使兒童怎肅去學習和培養兒童愛美與創作的本能。——參觀展覽會，以美術來代替他粗野下流的遊戲。</p>
<p>第三要使兒童怎樣進取美和造成兒童向上心理。——看名人作品，觀名家傳記，乃至講述淺顯的美術故事和美術史，使其對於美術（尤其是我國具有數千年悠久歷史的美術）有一個基本的槪念。僅僅使之臨臨畫本，照樣畫幾個葫蘆是不够的。</p>
<p>以上各點：在西歐，在日本都推行得有相當的成績，希望在中國，切勿將這工作等閒視之。尤盼負責兒童敎育的先生們，除去注意兒童身體健康外，還得培養兒童的心理健康才是。</p>

<h3>上學記</h3>
<p>— 小珏</p>
<p>我是六歲上學的。那時候，我住的那個小城裏，有兩種學校，一是私塾，裏面專讀些論語，孟子之類的書；一是學校，但那時候，人們大都稱牠為「洋學堂」。我的一位堂祖父是一個守舊人物，他極力反對我進「洋學堂」，說「洋學堂」是「潦黨」，而我的母親的意思：却和我的堂祖父相反，不願我進私塾，去讀死書。但結果，依顺我堂祖父的意見，我進了一家離我家很近的私塾。</p>
<p>上學的那天，是個「黃道吉日」這是堂祖父費了好多的時間揀定的，外婆家送來了許多糕，粽和一個繡着鯉魚跳龍門的綠色緞子書包。此外，有早已預備了的一隻櫈，紅漆得發亮的櫈，櫈脚上綁着一枝萬年靑，什么意思？我到現在還不明白，但大槪是種「口彩」罷。櫈底下又貼了糖餅，據說貼了這糖餅，孩子就此坐定讀書，不會戲嬉了。因為糖餅是黏的，把孩子的屁股黏住了。現在想來，眞覺可笑。</p>
<p>那天，我穿了長袍短褂，打扮得像一個「小紳士」。由我的大舅父，陪着進私塾去。因為第一次上學，一定要給舊同學吃糖茶的，其中的意思，據說：這樣將後就能够和他们和和氣氣一同讀書。所以我们後面跟了一個女佣人，她提了一大茶　的糖茶，預備分給私塾裏的同學吃。我們剛走進那條通那家私塾的弄堂時，就看見裏面有許多頭在搖呀擺地唸着書。踏進書房，讀書聲息忽然靜了下來，數十隻小眼睛都集向我看，我怕羞得躱在大舅父的身後。</p>
<p>大舅父拉着我拜了先生，又拜了孔子之後，我就坐到那紅漆得發亮的櫈子上，呆呆地望着那女佣分糖茶給同學們吃。</p>
<p>這個私塾，或許已受了「洋學堂」的影響，也新了起來，書房中央掛着的孔子像的下面，還扶起了一張　國父遺像來，兩旁邊還貼了兩面，不知有多少角的靑天白日旗。</p>
<p>就這樣，我雜在一羣孩子中間，慢慢地學着搖呀擺地唸起書來了。（卅六年二月重改）</p>

<h3>The Outer Areas of Tai'an Have Been Cleared, Mopping Up Continues on Both Sides of the Road, Communist Army in Northern Henan Collapses, Xinxiang Relieved</h3>
<p>[Telegraph from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 3rd] The National Army in Southern Shandong, Central Shandong, Western Shandong, and Northern Henan, as of the 3rd, has taken an absolutely advantageous and impregnable strategic position. The Communist Army's great dream of returning to northern Jiangsu from Ganyu, returning to the Taierzhuang line from Feixian, returning to the south of Guanghe from the north bank of the Yellow River to re-dig the Yellow River embankment, and taking the Yellow River iron bridge at Xinxiang to attack Zhengzhou, has now been completely shattered. According to aerial reconnaissance, the main force of the Communist Army in the Yimeng Mountains has been moving northeast in recent days. The Communist Army in the Yishui area is moving towards northern Shandong. If the National Army continues to exert pressure, the Communist Army in the Yimeng Mountains clearly intends to flee to Jiaodong.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] Two divisions of the National Army in Tai'an, after a fierce battle, have cleared the remaining Communist Army. The National Army advancing north and south along the Jinpu Railway has linked up with the National Army in Tai'an, and is beginning to mop up the Communist Army on both sides of the railway. Most of the Communist Army is currently concentrated in Xintai, Laiwu, Zichuan, Boshan, and the mountainous areas of Southern and Central Shandong, hiding during the day and coming out at night to avoid decisive battles with the main force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army corps north and south of Tai'an, on the 3rd, continued to mop up along the Jinpu Railway, with Tai'an as the center. The Wang Zhongwu unit coming from the north and south engaged in a considerable fierce battle with the Communist Army between Tushan and Zhangxia.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The National Army advancing towards the Yimeng Mountains from the southwest made further progress on the 3rd. In the west, it occupied Xiaqiao, Dongshi, and Lishi villages between Sishui and Xintai. The search troops in the south are approaching less than 50 li from Mengyin.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army in Feixian, Sishui, Liangqiu, and Phoenix Mountain continued to mop up the outer areas on the 3rd, capturing over 2,000 Communist soldiers.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Bengbu, 3rd] The Yao Zijian unit of the 9th Column of the Communist Army, which was defeated by the National Army in northeastern Sixian, fled in two directions. One group of over 1,000 fled to the Linheji and Cangji areas southwest of Siyang, and another group of over 1,000 fled to the Hongze Lake shore south of Siyang. The National Army is searching and suppressing them.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 3rd] The siege of Xinxiang was lifted on the 3rd. Huixian and Huaxian were recovered by the National Army on the 2nd. In an attempt to reverse the declining situation, Liu Bocheng personally led his 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, as well as the 12th Brigade of the 17th Division, a total of over 20,000 men, to launch seven or eight fierce attacks on the north bank of the Wei River and Jixian City from the 1st to the evening of the 2nd, and broke into the city four or five times. A fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued, and they were finally repelled by the defending troops. In this battle, the Communist Army suffered over 3,000 casualties and over 500 were captured. By noon on the 3rd, the Communist Army had been driven out to a distance of more than five kilometers, and the National Army is still pursuing them.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 3rd] The 1st Column of the Communist Army that attacked the Yellow River Railway Bridge suffered over 2,000 casualties on the 2nd and is now fleeing in disarray towards Yandianzhuang and Shatitou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd] The Liu Bocheng unit of the Communist Army, which was previously defeated by the National Army in western Shandong, in order to contain the National Army advancing on Tai'an from the west side of the Jinpu Railway, had long contemplated a gradual advance. However, since the Yellow River water has returned to its old course, they dared not cross south, so they fled along the north bank of the Yellow River towards northern Henan and joined forces with the Communist Army in the Taihang Military Region, threatening the central section of the Pinghan Railway. The military here saw through their conspiracy and made an accurate estimate of the strength of the Liu Bocheng remnants. They made leisurely deployments, and on the evening of the 1st, the Communist Army launched fierce attacks on Jixian and the bridgehead positions of the National Army at the northern end of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Fierce fighting continued throughout the night until the morning of the 2nd, and they were all repelled, with two regimental commanders and three battalion commanders killed or wounded. Other captives are still being investigated. Furthermore, the Communist Army's New 11th, New 12th, and New 13th Brigades, which had fled to Huixian and Jiaozuo, were heavily annihilated by the National Army today and are now fleeing northwest. The National Army in the above-mentioned areas is pursuing them separately.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 3rd] Over 4,000 remnants of the Jin Shaoshan, Wang Qimei, and Wei Fenglou units of the Communist Army's Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Military Region were besieged and annihilated by the National Army in the Gaoyangji area east of Tongxu on the 1st, suffering heavy losses. The remaining Communist Army suddenly fled to Tianlingzhai, eight kilometers northeast of Qixian, at noon on the 2nd. The National Army has surrounded them again and is in the process of annihilating them.</p>
<h3>Wayaobao Recovered Last Night, Fierce Fighting in the Jiuli Mountain Area in Northern Shaanxi, National Army in Yulin Advances Towards Zhenchuanbao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd] Wayaobao (east of Anding County), an important stronghold newly built by the Communist Party after fleeing Yan'an, was recovered by the National Army at 5:30 PM on the 3rd. The remaining Communist Army fled north in disarray. Most of the areas in northern Shaanxi, which were originally occupied by the Communist Army, have now been recovered.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] According to relevant sources, the battle in northern Shaanxi will focus on Jiuli Mountain. After the National Army took Yan'an, it divided its forces into three routes to advance north. The targets of the central and eastern routes are both Suide. The eastern route captured Yanchang, Yanchuan, and Qingjian, and is now blocked at Jiuli Mountain. The central route first captured Wayaobao and will then join the battle at Jiuli Mountain, moving towards Suide together with the Deng Baoshan unit advancing south from Yulin. The western route will take Qingbian after capturing Bao'an, and will join forces with the National Army from the three directions of Suining and Gansu to encircle the Sanbian area, in order to cut off the east-west connections of the main force of the Communist Army in northern Shaanxi and defeat them separately. Currently, in addition to attempting to make a comeback in the battle at Jiuli Mountain, the Communist Army is also attempting to cut off the National Army's rear to achieve a restraining effect. Qilong, north of Yan'an, was attacked by over 10,000 Communist soldiers who had infiltrated from Sanbian on the 1st. Lujiasai, southeast of Wayaobao, was also infiltrated by Communist soldiers on the 2nd, and they engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army coming from the west.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Taiyuan, 3rd] The central area of the CCP in northern Shaanxi has been shaken. Officials and soldiers are fleeing to Shanxi one after another. On the morning of the 3rd, ships continued to transport them across the river. Communist soldiers are also advancing north on the Lishi-Fangshan highway. The Communist Army in Pinglu and Shuoxian, which has been recovered by the National Army in northwestern Shanxi, has been subjected to pressure from the north. The Communist Army southeast of Zuoyun and north of Shuoxian is concentrating towards Shuoxian City in an attempt to hold the area by taking advantage of its strategic location. The force retreating from Zuoyun to Shuoxian consists of two regiments. Another unit is gathering at Yangfangkou, a strategic pass between Shuoxian and Ningwu. In addition, a regiment of the Communist Army southwest of Huairen retreated to Hunyuan, attempting to prevent the National Army from opening up traffic between Huairen, Yingxian, and Guangling.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The Communist Army in northern Shaanxi has concentrated its main force of over 20,000 men in the Laoyaguan, Jiuli Mountain, and Qiuyugou areas to hold out to the death. The two armies are engaged in bloody battles. An elite unit of the National Army has bypassed Laoyaguan and approached Lijiacuan, south of Suide. Scouting cavalry has even reached 20 li south of Suide. The National Army, which captured Lujiasai between Qingjian and Wayaobao, also bypassed the side and back of Jiuli Mountain at 2:00 PM on the 2nd and advanced to Lujiacun and Fanshupu on the western slope.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] After the National Army captured Qingjian in northern Shaanxi, because the natural barrier of Jiuli Mountain on the road to Suide is important, it has not advanced deeply and is making heavy deployments. The two armies are intertwined north of Qingjian, waiting for another battle opportunity to mature. The search and suppression troops are sweeping in three directions, north, east, and west. The battle for Wayaobao is continuing, and the fighting in nearby villages is fierce. All important strongholds along the Qingjian River connecting Qingjian and Wayaobao have been controlled by the National Army. Wujiasai, east of Wayaobao, has been captured by the National Army and is moving south along the river. It joined forces with the National Army advancing west from Qingjian on the morning of the 1st.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] A unit of the National Army advancing south from Yulin began to advance towards Zhenchuanbao on the 2nd. A brigade of the Communist Army is gathering at the strategic pass of Wanfodong, 15 li north of Mizhi. The Communist Army on the Hengshan side is rushing to build artillery positions in the mountains near Xiangshui on the Wuding River. There will be fierce fighting on that side. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the suburbs of Dingbian City.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Taiyuan, 3rd] Important CCP personnel and materials in northern Shaanxi are continuing to move to western Shanxi. On the 2nd, several cars and sedan cars drove east between Suide, Wubao, and Jundu-Liulin. A unit of the defeated Communist Army in northern Shaanxi is attempting to disturb the E尔多斯 Right Banner of the Inner Mongolia League.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The National Army attacking from Yingxian in northern Shanxi has approached the Shan'yin-Longmenguan line. Three brigades and one artillery battalion of the Communist Army have gathered there. Military transport by the Communist Army is frequent in the Hunyuan-Lingqiu area, in anticipation of new actions by the National Army. It is rumored that Peng Dehuai's command post has moved to the Kelan Mountains, and large carts are traveling incessantly between Wusai and Kelan, with materials being concentrated in the Wusai Mountains.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guihua, 3rd] The Communist Army in northern Shanxi launched a counterattack against Pinglu at dawn on the 2nd. The National Army is holding firm. The Kang Jianmin Brigade was surrounded and suppressed by the National Army at Matoushan, between Zuoyun and Fengzhen.</p>
<h3>Our Government Confers Medal on the President of Cuba, To Be Presented by Li Dihou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The government has recently decided to confer the Special Grand Cordon of the Auspicious Cloud Medal on Cuban President Dr. Grau.

<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] The letter from US Secretary of State Marshall to Molotov has recently been published here, the original text is as follows: "Dear Mr. Molotov, In response to your letter of March 24, 1947, and in consideration of the section on China in the 1945 Moscow Agreement, I am providing you with information, accompanied by the statements made by the US President on February 15, 1942, and December 18, 1946, explaining the US position. The US troops mentioned therein have, during the period covered by these reports, provided significant assistance in repatriating nearly three million Japanese from China as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and the Instrument of Surrender. I have no information regarding the disposal of nearly 700,000 Japanese in the Northeast who were directly detained by the Soviet Union. On January 29, 1947, the US Government announced its decision to terminate its relationship with the Committee of Three, which was established in Chongqing with the aim of ending the Chinese civil war. It also announced its decision to terminate its relationship with the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, which was established in Beiping by the Committee of Three with the aim of supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and military reorganization. The US government also issued a statement regarding the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps, whose mission was to ensure the safety of the US personnel of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation and to maintain communication between the Headquarters and Haikou. This action has greatly reduced the number of US Army and Navy personnel required in China, and withdrawals will continue as shipping becomes available. Upon completion of the current drawdown (estimated to be June 1, 1947), the US Army and Navy personnel remaining in China at the request of the Chinese National Government will number 6,180, roughly distributed as follows: US Army 1,510, including a advisory group of 750, 351 protecting US property and offices, 160 in air transport, 94 in the accounting office, and 155 various staff members.

I have provided a copy of this letter to Mr. Koo, and another to the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union for reference by the Chinese government."</p>

<h3>Is Life Meaningless? 17-Year-Old Boy in Beiping Commits Suicide by Poisoning, Abruptly Taking His Life After Playing "May Breeze"</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] A suicide case occurred in the Beijing Hotel the day before yesterday. The deceased seemed to hear the call of the god of death in the music of "May Breeze" and returned to his room to poison himself. The details are as follows: At 10:00 AM on the 1st, a young man came to the Beijing Hotel to check in, dressed luxuriously. He booked Room 120 and filled in the hotel register as Cai Zhong, 17 years old, from Guangzhou, residing at No. 15, Yongyixing, Xiaoxijie, Tanggu. The young man entered the room, rested briefly, and then went to the auditorium to play the piano. His tone was euphemistic and seemed to be proficient in music. When he played the popular song "May Breeze," the sound touched his emotions, so he left his seat and returned to his room. The next morning at 8:00 AM, the tea boy asked him for the owed sugar fee and pushed the door but it would not open. Knowing that something was wrong, he opened the window of the room and saw a small square table propping up the door. An empty box of anarcol (a strong sleeping pill) was found next to the bed. He then learned that he had taken poison and was sent to the Third Municipal Hospital, but he eventually died due to the prolonged time of poisoning. A suicide note was also found in the room, nearly a thousand words long, stating in brief: "The main reason for my suicide is indeed my ideological problem." "The current me thinks that life is absolutely meaningless, I can't find out why?" "We are born in the sea of people, just a grain of sand in the desert, a drop of water in the ocean, too small! When I heard the song May Breeze, I felt infinite disappointment and negativity." (The whole book is full of poetry)</p>

<h3>Children's Day and New Children's Enterprises</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>Today, we joyfully celebrate the 16th Children's Day of the Republic of China. The author was one of the first to advocate for Children's Day and participate in the Central Children's Year Implementation Committee. Looking back and forward, I feel that celebrating Children's Day should start with practically advocating for children's enterprises. Now, on this extremely memorable day, let's review this point:</p>
<p>Thanks to the progress of scientific research in psychology, physiology, education, etc., in modern times, people with knowledge have begun to value children and have established a belief that children themselves have value. In addition, the lessons of two World Wars have taught us that manpower is a prerequisite for winning everything, so all countries cherish their children. The fact that all countries have Children's Day and children's protection regulations can serve as evidence. Speaking of our country, just look at the history of the birth of Children's Day, and everyone knows that Shanghai is the birthplace of Children's Day in the Republic of China. More than ten years ago, the China Children's Welfare Association, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee, and other groups, had indelible advocacy achievements. At that time, a group of progressive industrial and commercial people in Shanghai rose up to support this very meaningful Children's Day and founded various children's enterprises. As far as I know, various newspapers have children's weeklies, and merchants have founded children's toy factories, children's clothing companies, etc., all of which were established after the government stipulated Children's Day and Children's Year. Even the Children's Bookstore, which specializes in spiritual food for children, although established in advance, has expanded and developed because of this! This is also a fact! Then, children's undertakings across the country sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. This very much proves that after Children's Day became a social movement, it has shifted the business policies of the industrial and commercial circles to children. Now let's talk about the United Kingdom and the United States. In their societies, you can often see the world of children. In terms of municipal construction alone, their goal is to consider adults on the one hand, and also take into account the welfare of children. For example, children's parks, children's playgrounds, children's libraries, children's hospitals, children's laboratories, children's theaters, etc., are all planned and gradually realized one by one. In the United States, there is a private enterprise called the National Boys' Club. This community is a social organization. The headquarters is located in New York, and branches are located in various states. Approximately each branch has between one hundred and ten thousand child members. The purpose of the association is to provide various activities that are beneficial to the physical and mental health of children, so that children can gain various cultivations in terms of physical health, mental health, career, and social interaction. The people who founded and presided over the association are all local people who are enthusiastic about children's undertakings, and the funds mainly come from donations. The headquarters also hires experts to go to various branches to inspect and guide, plan everything, and improve the direction of activities. The effect is no less than that of primary and secondary school education. This is worth emulating. In addition, the two major new enterprises of children's movies and children's radio also need to be established on a large scale. In big cities, the objective conditions for electrical education are relatively complete. After the war, the urban population is dense and buildings are scarce. This new tool of electrical education is even more needed to make up for the lack of space and time in school education, to move the teaching materials to the screen, or to broadcast the teaching process in space. By closely coordinating these two things, a large number of children can enjoy more convenient education anytime and anywhere. In short, this new tool of electrical education can expand the field and facilities of education. Therefore, the organization of electrical education is the newest type of children's enterprise. In the United States and the United Kingdom, most of these enterprises are private, and they are working hard to promote them under the conditions of government sponsorship and commercial competition; and in terms of quality, they are becoming more and more perfect, which is even more worth emulating.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the birthplace of Children's Day in the Republic of China. Wise and progressive industrialists and businesspeople have a correct understanding of new children's enterprises. In the past, they have had some brilliant achievements. In the history of the development of children's enterprises in our country, it inspires us to trust even more that Shanghai will never lag behind. On the occasion of Children's Day in the second year of victory, with all construction making strides forward, the author sincerely hopes that in the birthplace of Children's Day, a promotion campaign will be launched for the above-mentioned two major new children's enterprises. In the program of next year's Children's Day celebration, there will be countless aerial children's schools, broadcast celebration programs, and countless children's educational films or teaching materials, which will be shown in various schools and plazas in rotation. This is what must be advocated and realized as soon as possible in today's celebration.</p>
<p>Modern advanced countries all believe that the construction and promotion of children's welfare undertakings cannot achieve unity and macro-efficiency without establishing an organization that is a research hub. Therefore, in major cities, there are often organizations such as children's bureaus and children's welfare committees, which are responsible for dealing with unruly children and providing relief to poor children, which is the responsibility of the local government. The author believes that our authorities also consider this point, which is not only good news for children, but also great fortune for the nation and the country!</p>

<h3>The Issue of German Political Organization Handed Over to the Adjustment Committee for Handling The Four Foreign Ministers Have Reached an Agreement in Principle The United States and the Soviet Union May Reach a Compromise on the Issue of German Reparations</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] The Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the issue of the political organization of Germany on Thursday and reached an agreement in principle, advocating that the political organization of Germany be divided into four stages: (1) Establishment of a central administrative agency; (2) Establishment of an advisory committee; (3) Formulation of a provisional constitution and establishment of a provisional government; (4) Drafting of the German constitution. However, the representatives of the various countries still had very different opinions on other issues. U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall proposed that the matter be handed over to the Allied Control Council in Berlin for handling, but was rejected by the representatives of the various countries. Subsequently, British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed that the matter be handed over to the Adjustment Committee for sorting out, and then submitted a report to the Council of Foreign Ministers. This proposal was immediately adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: Marshall recently announced in Moscow that the U.S. is willing to consider a compromise plan on the issue of German reparations, in other words, the U.S. agrees to obtain limited reparations from Germany's current production.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] The United States is preparing to compromise with the Soviet Union at the meeting of the four powers today. According to authoritative sources, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has prepared a compromise proposal on the issue of German reparations, that is, to accept the principle of extracting reparations from Germany's current production after the German economy has reached a self-sufficient basis. It is said that Marshall is willing to reveal this plan at today's meeting, and may subsequently disclose it publicly. It is understood that the plan includes: (1) Making some decisions on the improvement of the German industrial level, which will make the number of German factories that can be moved for reparations according to the Potsdam method smaller; (2) Marshall will allow the extraction of some production from the few factories that remain unmoved for reparations, due to the higher level of the German industrial plan; (3) Marshall will insist that Germany should reach a self-sufficient basis in terms of necessary imports before the extraction of reparations, and should repay the expenses used by the Allies to prevent Germany from starvation so far.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Moscow, 4th Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers have been exhibiting for several weeks since the opening, and due to differences of opinion, there have been no achievements. Now it is nearing the end. The British and French sides expect the meeting to end on the 13th, while the U.S. delegation said that it will not be able to close until the 15th at the earliest. Marshall's position is still strong, secretly sending the message that this meeting will fail, and he will never make concessions to the Soviet Union. The British and French foreign ministers expressed concern about this, and they believe that if they return home empty-handed, they will not be able to cope with their respective parties. Among them, the position of French Foreign Minister Bidault is even more difficult. When the Council of Foreign Ministers meets today, it will discuss key issues such as eliminating the Nazis and democratizing Germany.</p>
<h3>Two Wartime Agreements Cause Major Disputes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 2nd] The current efforts of the Council of Foreign Ministers to reach an agreement have been greatly complicated by the two agreements of Potsdam and Yalta. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall publicly admitted that although the foreign ministers are now trying to consult in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, they have long known that the loose and ambiguous wording of the Potsdam Declaration is easy to produce various completely different interpretations. For each country, the agreement is almost one saying per person. The four major countries have all cited the agreement to prove that they are right and to criticize others. Marshall once said, "For the Soviet Union, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates various reparations worth tens of billions of dollars, and it can extract reparations from Germany's current production. For the United States and Britain, the Potsdam Agreement does not stipulate that reparations should be extracted from current production, and the number of tens of billions of dollars in the Yalta Agreement has become invalid. For Britain and the Soviet Union, the Potsdam Agreement stated that the German central agency should be presided over by Germans, but for France, the agreement only stated that a central agency should be established under the control of the four powers. France still has many different understandings of the timing and manner of establishing a central agency in Germany, and as a result, Germany cannot have economic unity. The Soviet Union believes that the merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany violates the agreement and should be stopped. Britain and the United States believe that this merger is within the scope of the agreement. For generations to come, all parties will point to any point in the Potsdam and Yalta agreements as clear evidence of the other country's breach of faith. Therefore, unless we can truly confer wholeheartedly and truly want to fulfill the words and spirit of the agreement, it is better to have no agreement." Judging from Marshall's statement that he is not in a hurry to make a hasty decision, it is enough to know that he will avoid repeating the mistakes of shoddy work.</p>
<h3>Clay Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] General Clay, the commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, returned to Berlin from Moscow today to defend the decision. Clay was originally summoned to the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the report of the Allied Control Council, but now that the discussion is practically over, he has returned to Germany. It is said that if Marshall needs him, he can come to Moscow.</p>

<h3>British Factories Plan to Move to Australia The Relocation Time Will Take Twenty Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, Canberra, 2nd] Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced today that the British government plans to gradually move various industries to Australia, and the relocation time will take twenty years.

<h3>The Soviet Union Recalls Its Ambassador to Greece A Prelude to the Severance of Diplomatic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Greece</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 2nd] The Soviet Union has already recalled its ambassador to Athens, Rodionov. It is generally believed that this is the first step the Soviet Union will take to sever diplomatic relations with Greece in order to implement a foreign school counter-offensive after President Truman announced his plan to aid Greece and Turkey. Rodionov is scheduled to leave Greece with all the staff of the embassy on Friday. He visited the Greek foreign minister today to ask him to issue exit passports. People at the Soviet embassy here, in addition to confirming Rodionov's trip, were unwilling to reveal whether he would never return. The diplomatic community here was surprised by Rodionov's sudden return home, and there has been no response from the authorities so far. According to reports, Rodionov left Athens for the Soviet Union on August 31 last year. He told the Greek foreign minister at the time that he would complete a certain task, and he did not return to his post in Athens until January 28 this year.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Athens, 3rd] Reports that all the staff of the Soviet embassy will be in trouble leaving the capital of Greece have been denied by the Soviet embassy. It was also said that Soviet Ambassador Rodionov will return home on Friday to report, but during his absence, the embassy secretary will handle everything as chargé d'affaires.</p>
<h3>The Security Council Unanimously Approves the Draft US Trusteeship Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Security Council today unanimously approved the preamble to the U.S. plan to unilaterally take over the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific. Previously, there had been heated debates between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union proposed an amendment, arguing that the amendment and abolition of the provisions of the trusteeship agreement should be decided by the Security Council. The United States proposed a counter-amendment, saying that the amendment and abolition of the agreement must be mutually agreed upon by the administering country and the Security Council. Soviet representative Gromyko finally agreed to the original proposal with the other ten representatives. Gromyko abstained from voting on the U.S. counter-amendment. Afterwards, U.S. representative Austin said: "This is a manifestation of the United Nations' work." The Security Council adjourned until the 3rd to discuss the dispute between Britain and Albania.</p>
<h3>The Five Powers All Agree to Convene a Special Session of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>To Deal with the Palestine Issue</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Lake Success, New York, 2nd] It is learned that the British government has formally requested the United Nations General Assembly to convene a special session to discuss the Palestine issue, and the secretariat of the United Nations has confirmed this. China and France have responded to the request of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and have expressed their agreement. As for the United States and the Soviet Union, they have expressed their support before China and France. Therefore, the five permanent members of the Security Council have unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] London, 3rd Broadcast: Senior officials of the British government announced today that the United Nations General Assembly has decided to convene a special session to discuss the Palestine issue. In this meeting, the British side will never give up the mandate of Palestine. The British side expects the agenda of this meeting to be divided into two parts: (1) A detailed report on the mandate, emphasizing the inability to promote the integration of Jews and Arabs; (2) Requesting member states to express their opinions on the British side's achievements in Palestine and solutions. However, if there are suggestions such as canceling the mandate, the British side will resolutely oppose them.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister's Speech Praises Britain and the United States and Says He Will Never Be Hostile to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Turkish Capital, 2nd] Turkish Prime Minister Baker delivered an important speech in Izmir (formerly Smyrna) today, expounding Turkey's foreign policy and emphasizing Turkey's friendship with Britain and the United States. His speech roughly stated: The alliance between Britain and Turkey is still strong and sincere, and we must not forget the significant impact this alliance has had on our lives recently. As for the relations between the United States and Turkey, they are also based on the same status. The United States' friendship with Turkey is very strong, and it is expanding its effective assistance. The policy adopted by Turkey is completely based on Western democracy. As the Prime Minister of Turkey, although I have to say this, I still want to point out that I do not harbor any emotions of hostility towards the Soviet Union. Soviet newspapers recently said that when the German army reached the Caucasus and advanced deep into Leningrad, the Turkish army in northeastern Anatolia had the appearance of attacking the Soviet army. In fact, the Turkish army was working hard to prevent the German army from landing in Turkey, and the Soviet Union also expressed its agreement to this. If the German army had taken the offensive, the country would have joined the Allied side long ago.</p>
<h3>During the Period of Negotiated Control, the United States Is Unwilling to Stop Manufacturing Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Lake Success, 2nd] The secret meeting records of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission in July last year were recently published here, proving that the U.S. government could not agree to stop the manufacturing of atomic bombs during the negotiations on the control of the original center. The proposer was French representative Curie, who asked the United States to stop manufacturing atomic bombs in order to comfort public opinion and facilitate discussion. This view was endorsed by several scientific associations, including the Federation of American Scientists. The French representative's proposal was in line with the Soviet Union's proposal to abolish the manufacturing and application of atomic weapons. The U.S. representative firmly stated in the secret meeting: The government of this country cannot accept the French representative's proposal, because stopping the manufacturing of atomic bombs should be the result of negotiations, not out of free will. Based on this, the United States is still manufacturing atomic bombs from July last year to the present.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 2nd] Republican Senator Taft recently made a speech, arguing that Baruch's plan for international control of atomic energy should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 2nd] Canadian Minister of Reconstruction, Howe, said: Canada can also manufacture atomic bombs now if it wants to.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Line Open, Interrupted for Nine Hours, Fourth-Class Passenger Train Derails at Lingkou, Passengers and Goods Fortunately Safe</h3>
<p>The 58th train from Shanghai to Beijing derailed near Danyang the day before yesterday, causing all trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line to be suspended yesterday morning. A large number of spring tourists and people going to Beijing were stranded, unable to advance or retreat, and were extremely anxious. The track was repaired at 10:15 AM on the same day, and the Jinling special train at 1:30 PM was able to depart on time. According to reports, the 58th train was a fourth-class passenger train, towed by locomotive P-538. In addition to passengers, it also carried many freight cars. It departed from Shanghai Station at 5:20 PM on the 2nd. At 1:22 AM that night (i.e., yesterday morning), it arrived at Lingkou Station near Danyang. When the locomotive and the rear passenger car entered the east branch line, the locomotive suddenly derailed completely at the frog of the branch line, and the front two wheels of the first passenger car were also pulled off the track. Fortunately, the driver acted quickly and braked immediately, so the train body did not overturn, and there were no casualties or losses of passengers and goods. However, because the track and sleepers were severely damaged, it was difficult to repair them urgently, and the damaged area was located at the branch line switch, so the 9th and 11th passenger trains from Beijing to Shanghai were blocked and unable to pass. The 6th and 8th passenger trains from Shanghai to Beijing were also unable to depart because there were no cars to transfer them. After the accident, the stationmaster of Lingkou Station immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Bureau to report, and also telegraphed the Qishuyan Changzhou Locomotive Depot, together with the police, car, and engineering sections along the line, to rush to repair. In order to facilitate passengers on the line, the two railway bureaus also added two shuttle trains at 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM on the same morning, with Wuxi as the terminus. The track damage at Lingkou Station was completely repaired at 10:15 AM after hard work, and the Jinling sightseeing train to Beijing at 1:30 PM was able to depart on time. The 9th and 11th trains stranded at Lingkou Station arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM, respectively. However, the Qiantang sightseeing train, originally scheduled to depart at 4:00 PM, was delayed until 6:00 PM due to a conflict in car delivery time. As for the cause of the derailment, according to Chen Shuyi, the general stationmaster of the Railway Bureau in Shanghai, most locomotive derailments are caused by the following four reasons: (1) soft road (i.e., track tilting), (2) excessive speed, (3) switchman not correcting the switch, and (4) other accidents. However, the Railway Bureau has not yet received a report and is conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The 58th Beijing-Shanghai fourth-class slow train, which departed from Shanghai to Beijing at 5:40 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, had a locomotive wheel suddenly derail at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd when passing the east branch of Lingkou Station between Danyang and Zhenjiang. With a loud bang, the entire locomotive immediately derailed, and two passenger cars were also pulled out and overturned. According to the Lingkou Station's investigation report, the right track of the road had lost its toughness, and the two tracks could not be balanced, causing the disaster. This morning, trains between Beijing and Shanghai could only reach around Zhenjiang. The 90th and 2nd passenger trains from Beijing were not dispatched. At 11:00 AM, in order to solve the crowding of passengers, Beijing added a temporary shuttle train between Beijing and Zhenjiang. It was restored in the afternoon. All trains were delayed.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 3rd] At about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the 58th fourth-class passenger train from Shanghai to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai line suddenly had a section of the rail damaged and cracked when passing through Lingkou Station between Danyang and Changzhou, causing the passenger car to overturn. Fortunately, the driver immediately tried to stop the train. Only the locomotive derailed, and the passengers were not injured. It was repaired and opened to traffic at about 12:00 noon. The cause of the crack is currently being investigated.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Yuan Xinpei's Kidnapping: Architect Colludes with Military Personnel to Commit Crimes, Captain Tang Has Been Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The North Station Police Precinct captured four kidnappers, including Zhang Tigong, at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Zhongzheng Road the day before yesterday, as reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the case also involves a captain of a certain military organ in the city, Tang Yuyuan. Yesterday, Tang was detained by his superiors. The victim in this case was Yuan Xinpei. At about 8:00 PM on the 23rd of last month, five armed soldiers and one man each in a suit and a gown, riding in two cars, arrived at Yuan's residence at 18 Hengji Lane, Qipu Road. After they disliked opening the door, they claimed to be checking for drugs. They found a Shuanglong brand morphine trademark in a Japanese version and a small packet of morphine, and then extorted 80 million yuan. That night, because Yuan only had several hundred thousand in cash at home, Yuan was kidnapped and driven away, hidden on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Middle Road. That evening, Yuan's concubine, Jin, in order to rescue her husband, opened a room at the Dongya Hotel, No. 332, to negotiate with them. As a result, the ransom was reduced from 80 million to 30 million yuan, but because there was no such huge amount of cash, it was not paid. By the next morning, Yuan repeatedly called home five times: (1) "I am safe outside, don't worry." (2) He asked his son to borrow 3 million yuan from Yongsheng Ironworks on Zhejiang Road. (3) He also asked to increase it by 1 million yuan. (4) He said that after the money was ready, it should be placed at the entrance of Yongsheng Ironworks. (As a result, no one came to inquire.) (5) He told his family that he had been released. At that time, the Haizhu Road Jiangxi Road Inspection Brigade had reported the case and joined forces with the North Station Police Precinct to investigate. It was learned that the main culprit in this case was Zhang Tigong, a well-known figure in Xincheng District, an architect, who had colluded with Tang Yuyuan, the captain of a certain military organ, and others to commit the crime. That night, Tang Yuyuan personally led four inspectors and Zhang and seven others to kidnap Yuan Xinpei. The next afternoon, an inspector escorted Yuan to a bank to withdraw 10 million yuan before releasing Yuan. Zhang Tigong later received 2 million yuan in cash and 120 US dollars. Stone Stock, the head of the North Station Police Bureau, learned the situation and found out that the main culprit, Zhang Tigong, lived at No. 23 Chongqing Road, had officers accompanying him, and was extravagant. Captain Tang also frequented the place. The officers disguised themselves and waited, and monitored Zhang's actions for four days and nights. Before dawn, they learned that Qiang Jie was fleeing to another place, and hired a friend's Ning car company to send a car to the North Station. The people in the car were Tang Guixiang, Zai Shifu, and He Jinbiao. The performers waiting near Chongqing Road waited for them to get on the car, stopped the car, and arrested all four criminals, including Zhang Tigong.</p>
<p>It is also learned that when the police officers fired their guns to stop the car, a stray bullet accidentally injured the driver of the dispatched car, Ji Xingsheng. Fortunately, the bullet hit his shoulder, and the injury was slight, so there was no major problem.</p>
<h3>The Tragically Deceased Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shows Signs of Being Murdered: No Water in Abdomen, Scars on Body, Re-Examine the Body to Ascertain the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On the morning of the 23rd of last month, a male floating corpse was found at Pier 13 of the Bund. The deceased was identified as Zheng Zongjing, who lived at 12 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, and worked as a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. It was also verified that the corpse had three scars on his neck and minor injuries on his face. There was no swelling of the abdomen due to water entering, which seemed to indicate that he had been murdered and thrown into the river. According to the deceased's family, on the afternoon of March 21, Zheng Zongjing was invited out for "tea" due to a housing dispute with the second landlord, Shao Kunshan, and never returned. They also said that the second landlord, Shao Kunshan, also known as Shao Sanmazi, had considerable potential influence in the nearby area. Therefore, the police had summoned and investigated him. According to Shao, Zheng may have committed suicide due to economic pressure and had nothing to do with him. Fang Zheng, the on-duty prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, and forensic doctor Yi Ziwei, specially went to re-examine Zheng's corpse yesterday to prove whether he had been killed before his death or committed suicide by drowning.</p>
<h3>Messberg on Trial Again for Illegal Trading of Gold, Banknotes, and Foreign Exchange, Defendant Stenographer Requests Verification of Testimony, Mrs. Bao Flies from Beiping to Shanghai to Testify</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the government promulgated emergency economic measures, the foreign company Abas was involved in illegal buying and selling of foreign exchange and foreign currency, disrupting the financial case. The court reopened the trial again at 2:00 PM yesterday. "Foreign Tiger" Messberg and other relevant witnesses were summoned to the court. The Dutch Consul General Mittbourg and the Embassy Counselor Yang Yunsan also attended the hearing. According to Yang's statement to reporters: Regarding Messberg's detention, the Dutch Embassy formally protested to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs a few days ago. However, after the trial yesterday, the court still refused to release him on bail. As soon as President Meng Tingke finished asking the defendant's age and place of origin, the defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, stood up and</p>
<p>declared four points: (1) During the previous hearing, many economic terms in the testimony of the defendant and witnesses were mistranslated during translation. It is requested that the record be translated into English by the defense lawyer and checked with the defendant. If there are any errors, a correction should be made. (2) The testimony of the witnesses should also be translated into English so that the defendant can understand. (3) Please allow the defendant to prepare more detailed accounts for comparison with the accounts prepared by accountant Xie. (4) The 38 gold bars seized were indeed deposited by Tianjin customers. There is now a telegram from Tianjin Linxing Company that can prove it, and Kang Pace, the safe deposit box manager of Abas Company, is in court, and the court can</p>
<p>summon him to testify. President Meng continued to question the defendant Messberg. According to the testimony: The numbers of telegraphic transfers and mail transfers listed in accountant Xie's audit report are generally consistent and can be agreed. Abas Company mainly deals in telegraphic transfers, with very few cash transactions. After February 17, it only sold 1,839 US dollars in spot, and paid out legal tender in Shanghai after placing telegraphic transfers in New York. There was a deposit of 20,000 yuan in Hong Kong dollars, and no more was done. Gold was purchased from the United States, sold in Hong Kong, and not done in Shanghai. As for the safe deposit boxes in the company, they are all for the safekeeping of customers' items. Kang Pace</p>
<p>knows the details. According to Kang Pace: 53 years old, Portuguese, an employee of Abas Company, responsible for managing the safe deposit boxes. According to his memory, the company has a total of 53 safe deposit boxes, which are not rented out and are all used by the company to keep its own items, but he also said that some of them are also used by customers and company employees to deposit property. When asked about the witnesses Pabotesito (bookkeeper), Potria (auditor), Shao Shunqin (bookkeeper), and Shi Jiusen (cashier), all four denied that there were any gold transactions after February 17. The 1,839 US dollars were also sold by Japanese people. The court then interrogated Kang Pace and questioned the 38 gold bars.</p>
<p>When asked who they belonged to, he said: They were entrusted to him by broker Chen Xiexin. At the same time, there were also 11,211 US dollars, which Chen also entrusted to him on behalf of Tianjin Lin and Company. He also said that Chen Xiexin is now in court. President Meng then summoned Chen to testify. According to Chen: He used to work for Xinfeng Bank (opened in the same place as Abas Company), and is now a broker. Around September 20 last year, Tianjin Linxing Company telegraphed Xinfeng to sell a batch of government bonds. After the sale, the funds were entrusted to him to purchase gold and US dollars in half. Because Chen and Kang were very close friends, he entrusted Kang Pace to keep them. At that time, the gold bars were</p>
<p>sealed with paper, and the word "wait" was signed on it in red and green pencils. At the same time, the gold was not owned by Linxing Company itself, but was entrusted by Mrs. Bao from the client. He also said that Mrs. Bao had specially traveled from Beiping to Shanghai and asked the court to summon her. At this time, Zhang Yamin, the leader of the Garrison Command team attending the hearing, suddenly stood up and pointed at Chen Xiexin and said: When he was ordered to search Sassoon Building on March 3, this person was also present and said that he had nothing to do with the company. The court also summoned Mrs. Bao (Yun of Bao Xingcha, manager of Siemens Foreign Bank in Tianjin), saying that she was 66 years old, from Wuxian. When the government froze foreign exchange, she entrusted Wang Dongju, the manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Tianjin Zhongnan Bank, to buy it on her behalf.</p>
<p>It is stored in Shanghai with a bearer code sheet, with which she can come to Shanghai to collect it. She also said that half of it belongs to the old lady Guo, and presented her plane ticket stub and vaccination certificate to prove that she had indeed come from Beiping. Prosecutor Quan Tao stood up and said: Abas Company has more than 90 billion yuan in funds and is the main culprit in this gold rush. He requested strict handling. The defendant's defense team reapplied for bail, but it was rejected again. The court ordered the debate to be held on April 7, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Crackdown on Drug Trafficking Organization, More Than Twenty People Arrested, Many Hotels Harboring Dirt and Accepting Dirt</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shi, the head of the Laoza Police Precinct, received a secret report a month ago stating that there was a large-scale drug trafficking organization in his jurisdiction. He ordered Jiang Shangpei, the head of the judicial stock, to start an investigation. Zhang Kuilian, Chen Jun'an, Wang Congzhou, Yang Zhongmin, Li Junkun and other officers were dispatched to disguise themselves and distribute themselves in the Jingdong Lane area of Guangxi Road to investigate. They finally arrested Qian Jinsheng and Ju Shaoqing at the entrance of the lane at 2:00 PM one day and brought them to the precinct for interrogation. They learned that the heroin den was located in Room 414 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road. They went to the place to search and continued to arrest Zhang Jinshan and He Sishi. Later, they searched a can of heroin weighing one tael and 13 small packets of morphine at the bottom of the dressing table in the room. Police officers waited for a long time and successively arrested 12 men and women, including Wang Zhangle and others. They also found a letter written by the main culprit, Chen Hongyuan, and learned of the communication addresses: (1) No. 260, Dongfang Hotel, (2) No. 4, Jingqin Lane, (3) No. 3, Weishui Lane, Guangxi Road. Later, the police officers went to Dongfang No. 26 to wait for Chen. He arrived and was arrested. They also found three taels of heroin under the bed and brought them to the precinct. He confessed that he had purchased it from Cao Meiquan, the king of heroin. Each transaction was conducted in the dance hall tea room. Cao was still on the second floor of the Xinya Tea Room. The officers in charge rushed to catch Cao's wife, Jin Nv, and Chen's wife, He, while Cao had left. They also learned that Cao had a mistress, Chen Guoying, who lived at No. 1 Baoyuan Lane, Qingyun Street, Nanshi. As a result, Cao was arrested in the box room on the second floor. At that time, a square stool was found with a hidden drug mechanism inside. They tried to open it and found four taels of heroin inside. Seeing that the secret was revealed, he immediately removed his diamond ring and gold watch chain to bribe them, but they were sternly rejected. Chen Guoying and the maid, Wang Amao, were brought to the precinct at the same time. They confessed that the sources of drugs were in three places: (1) Wu Tonghai at No. 68, Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, (2) Xu Xiaokai, Zhi Telephone No. 34933, (3) Zhang Zhengyu at No. 404, Zhongnan Hotel. They successively arrested Wu Tonghai, as well as Zhan Decheng and Zhan's wife, Wang, at No. 69, Anshang Hotel, Yunnan South Road, Wei Shaochu and Wang Defu at Chunjiang Hotel, and Tang Chengxuan and Zhang Shi at Zhongnan Hotel. They went to Xu Xiaokai's residence and learned that it was at Room 24, No. 8, Lane 53, Seymour Road. When they went to arrest him, they only caught the drug dealer Xu Ruiqi. In addition, they also found Gu and others in Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road. A total of more than 20 people have been arrested in this case and will be sent to the court for trial.</p>

<h3>Merchants Excuse Not Keeping Accounts, Decided to Be Treated as Attempting to Evade Taxes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] For the winter business tax of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) for various businesses in this city, the Finance Bureau has been sending out declaration forms to each household since March 17, setting a deadline for submission. However, the Finance Bureau recently discovered that some small and medium-sized stores claimed that their organization was simple and did not establish accounting books, so the declaration forms could not be filled out and requested to reissue estimated declaration forms. The Finance Bureau believes that this action is suspected of attempting to evade taxes. A notice was issued yesterday to strictly correct this situation. In the future, all businesses, except those with legal books, must prepare a daily log and ledger to record the inflow and outflow of money and goods for inspection by the responsible collection agency. The estimated declaration form printed by the Finance Bureau last quarter is a flexible measure during the transition period. Once the bad habit of not keeping accounting books is eradicated, the estimation method will be abolished. Regardless of the size of the store, all should establish accounts. If the declaration form was used to fill out the previous quarter, but the estimated declaration form is requested in the winter under the pretext, it will be regarded as an attempt to evade taxes and will be punished accordingly.</p>

<h3>Another New Initiative by the Post Office: Printing Standard Envelopes, Intending to Invite Students to Serve in Their Spare Time to Help Sort and Press Accumulated Mail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to save delivery time and improve work efficiency, the Shanghai Post Office has been continuously promoting new measures for several months. After announcing the implementation of the regional delivery system at the end of last month, it is now planning to adopt standard envelopes in the short term. The bureau is currently bidding for printing according to the standard envelope style stipulated by the Post Office Headquarters, and welcomes general printing merchants to imitate it so that citizens can use it universally. According to Wang Yuguang, the assistant to the bureau, the schedules of ships from various countries recently are very abnormal. Sometimes several ships arrive in Shanghai at the same time, with more than thousands of bags of mail. Even in China, because the transportation has not fully returned to normal, similar situations often occur. There is a shortage of postal staff, and it is difficult to sort out these accumulated mails one by one in a short period of time. Therefore, the bureau is currently planning to write to various middle schools to invite students to participate in this temporary mail sorting work in their spare time, and give them appropriate remuneration. Those with excellent performance will be issued certificates of merit. In the future, students who serve and are willing to participate in postal services will be given priority in admission. This is not without the meaning of serving the public on the student's side. In addition, the bureau will also take the method of hiring short-term workers to meet this special need, in order to reduce the difficulty for postal staff to cope with the large number of letters delivered from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. every day.</p>

<h3>Launching a World Children's Mutual Aid Movement: Children Helping Children</h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>Today, I sincerely want to say a few words to teachers and children across the country. During this Normal School Education Movement Week, and as it is also Children's Day, all teachers will surely be thinking about how to educate children. Regarding this issue, I suggest that we, as teachers and parents, initiate a kind of children's education movement—a children's mutual aid movement. We, as teachers, should not only teach children self-reliance but also teach them mutual assistance. How can children help each other?</p>
<p>The eight-year War of Resistance has finally ended. What we urgently expect now is how to establish world peace. The establishment of world peace certainly depends on economic and political issues of all kinds, but it is very important that children worldwide can understand peace and practice mutual assistance.</p>
<p>How can children help each other? I suggest that children in Shanghai take the lead in making a sincere appeal to children across the country and around the world to jointly organize a World Children's Mutual Aid Association. Today, most Chinese children are very unfortunate. They lack food and need help; they lack clothing and need help; and even in terms of cultural knowledge, they need help. Children in the interior, in particular, need help. We can send letters, gifts, and written materials, such as books, to children in the interior to help them understand children in Shanghai. Moreover, we can launch this movement not only to let children in the interior know about the situation of children in Shanghai but also to let children in Shanghai know about the situation of children in the interior; not only to enable children in Shanghai and the interior to understand each other but also to enable children in various places to understand each other; not only to understand the situations of children in various places but also to understand everything in various places. In this way, children's mutual assistance will have a very significant effect. Children in Shanghai and the interior can do this, and children in Shanghai and foreign countries can certainly do this as well.</p>
<p>Recently, my child wrote from the western United States, mentioning that American children are eager to understand Chinese children. However, they are quite unfortunate because there are not many Chinese people there, and no one guides them. Therefore, in their cultural boxes, the items about China include only bound feet shoes, silk fabrics, and some porcelain. Obviously, these things cannot represent today's China. Therefore, it is of great significance to help them understand China.</p>
<p>If every child can donate a little something, then we, the 200,000 children in Shanghai, can create many cultural boxes and send them to American children to help them understand our situation, or send them to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Not only to European and American countries, but we can also send them to children in Asian countries to let children in India, Burma, and Siam know about Chinese children, and connect Chinese and foreign children. How great would that be!</p>
<p>Recently, we often see in the newspapers reports of anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam, the Philippines, and other places. Why do they discriminate against the Chinese? The reason is that they do not understand the situation in China. If they could understand each other, the problem would definitely be much simpler. Children in Shanghai should quickly organize themselves. We must get in touch with children in India, Burma, Siam, the Philippines, and other countries, and love and help each other. This would definitely make a great contribution to the world peace movement.</p>
<p>The responsibility of teachers is to facilitate children's mutual assistance. We should not only teach one child to be able to help others, but also teach all children to be friendly and helpful. We must enable children in Shanghai to connect with children across the country, and connect with children around the world, to expand the world peace movement. However, how to promote the children's mutual aid movement depends entirely on the efforts of us teachers. Teachers in Shanghai, unite and promote the children's mutual aid movement!</p>
<p>We must enable wealthy children to help poor children, enable children with high levels of education to help children with low levels of education, and enable children in school to help children who are out of school. All of this requires us teachers to initiate. We must know that a teacher's job is not just to teach well, but mainly to teach children to do things themselves. The first major global event after World War II is the world peace movement. Teachers should take responsibility for promoting this movement from Shanghai to various places, and from China to foreign countries. In fact, foreign children have already started mutual aid movements. Two months ago, the children of the attached elementary school of Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School received a cultural box from the children of a school in California, USA. That school had only a few dozen children, but they donated many books to Chinese children. I know that children in other parts of the United States have also sent cultural boxes to children in various countries around the world. Children in Shanghai must not fall behind. We should help each other with children in various parts of the country and with children in various countries around the world!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this 16th Children's Day, which is also the last day of this year's Normal School Education Movement Week, let us launch a children's mutual aid movement so that children around the world can understand, trust, respect, and help each other. Then, China can achieve lasting peace, and the world can also achieve lasting peace.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Discussion Meeting to Discuss Lowering Oil Prices; Decision to Strengthen Joint Distribution Organization</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened a discussion meeting at 3:00 pm yesterday with various units in the oil industry to discuss how to lower oil prices and strengthen the joint distribution organization. The meeting began with a report from Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, who stated that the highest authorities are extremely concerned about the recent soaring prices of edible oil in the city. Therefore, this meeting was convened to discuss the reasons for the rise in edible oil prices and how to lower them. The lack of control by the joint distribution organization must also be reviewed. A representative of the Oil Pressing Industry Association stated that the cost of raw materials for the oil pressing industry is higher than the price of finished products. Due to the high costs, the association cannot supply edible oil to the joint distribution organization. If the government can supply raw materials, they can process oil on behalf of the government, charging only a low processing fee. Otherwise, the price of distributed oil must be raised. A representative of the joint distribution organization stated that the organization has received a total of more than 16,000 dan of edible oil this year, which is far from the actual required amount. They hope that the supply of edible oil will not be interrupted in the future. After discussions, the following points were agreed upon: (1) Attempts will be made to purchase soybeans from the Northeast Economic Commission to increase the source of raw materials. (2) After the Price Evaluation Committee is established, oil prices will be determined based on costs. (3) The organization of the joint distribution organization will be strengthened, and oil factories should be included to facilitate communication and mutual understanding. (4) The joint distribution organization has more than 1,000 dan of oil that has been allocated but not yet claimed, and efforts will be made to request the Oil Factory Association to supply the oil to clear the backlog.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Plans to Stabilize Oil Prices</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, in response to the edible oil problem, specially convened the responsible personnel of major oil factories to inquire about the situation. He also met with President Zhang of the National Bank to discuss ways to thoroughly stabilize oil prices. The principles were decided yesterday: (1) Maximize production, (2) Supply raw materials, (3) Provide loans. The detailed measures will be drafted this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Price Hikes in Production Areas; Rice Grain Sources Decreasing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 5,000 shi of rice grain arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Prices in the production areas are gradually increasing, causing distress to consumers.

High-quality white rice has increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and indica rice has followed suit, rising by around 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to high domestic prices, flour sales are brisk, with prices increasing by more than 1,000 yuan. Bran continues to be sold quickly, with prices increasing by 300 to 500 yuan.

Prices in various production areas are decreasing one after another as new goods enter the market.</p>
<h3>Although There is an Uptrend in Chinese Stocks, Many Investors Remain on the Sidelines</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were stimulated yesterday by news of a thorough investigation of the foreign stock market, and were unusually strong midway through the day. However, due to the fact that investors outside the industry are still on the sidelines, the uptrend could not be sustained, and many retail investors were disappointed. The market became sluggish after being strong in the afternoon, and swap spreads fell from 40 yuan to 30 yuan due to short sellers and banks adding to their short positions, with daily interest rates less than six percent.</p>
<p>The market opened strong, and Diyi Textile quickly rose to 2,480 yuan upon opening. It then slightly declined to 2,330 yuan due to active selling. However, due to the extremely strong trading of Diyi Textile spot goods, No. 185 and others continued to buy, gradually pushing the price up. At 11:15 am, it broke through the 2,500 yuan mark. At this time, China France, Firecrackers, Lian An, and Meya all rose to their limit. No. 104 and No. 215 briefly sold off when prices were high. After 11:45 am, the liquidity of the market decreased, and Diyi Textile rose to a high of 2,570 yuan. Near noon, No. 218 and No. 117 made slight settlements, causing a slight decline. As a result, Xinhe rose by more than 10% compared to the previous close, while Yong Textile, Xinguang, Xinhua, and Huafeng each rose by less than 10%. Meya and China France rose to their limit. In the forward market, Yong Textile, Xinhe, Meya, and Huafeng each rose by slightly more than 10%, Xinguang rose by 10%, cold stocks Lian An, Firecrackers, and Commercial rose to their limit, Datong, Jinglun, and Yonggong each rose by more than 10%, Cement Rongfeng had little trading and remained flat, and the rest rose by varying degrees up to half a percent.</p>
<p>The market was still bullish in the afternoon, with as many as six stocks, including Firecrackers and Meya, rising to their limit. As a result, investors took profits at high prices, and selling suddenly became strong. Rumors that Shanghai would be allocated 90% of the US dollar bonds spread, causing investor sentiment to weaken, and prices fell to 2,435 yuan. However, some people took advantage of the low prices to maintain the market, and prices rebounded to 2,490 yuan. Subsequently, No. 105 and others sold the stock down to around 2,450 yuan. Although No. 171 and others purchased the stock, the market was still overwhelmed by the selling pressure, and Diyi Textile fell to 2,400 yuan. No. 97, No. 117, No. 2, and No. 179 entered the market, and the market slightly rebounded near the close. As a result, Yong Textile and Xinhe rose by about half a percent compared to the previous close. Meya rose by less than 10%, Xinguang, Huafeng, and Xinhua rose slightly, Qinxing remained flat, and China France rose to its limit. In the forward market, Yong Textile and Xinhe rose by more than half a percent, Xinguang and Huafeng rose slightly, Meya rose by less than 10%, cold stocks Commercial, Cement, and Firecrackers rose to their limit and then declined, Lian An rose to its limit, Rongfeng fell by half a percent, and Zhongfang, Tongyi, Jinglun, and Yonggong each rose by more than half a percent. Underwear fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. All stocks outside the market rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Trading Sparse</h3>
<p>The public bond market yesterday was still lackluster, with a trading volume of less than 5 million yuan. Rooms 512, 555, and 552 were buying, while rooms 551 and 544 were selling. Unified Bond C opened at 11,700 yuan, with a high of 13,200 yuan and a low of 11,500 yuan. The market slightly rebounded near the close, and the results were stable compared to the previous close for all bonds. After the close, prices rebounded to over 13,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stock Market Halted Briefly Due to the Investigation and Confiscation of Intercom Telephones</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market was halted briefly yesterday before 11:00 am due to the investigation and confiscation of intercom telephones, which affected the meeting. Trading resumed after the investigators left. Yisha rose from 31,700 yuan to 32,200 yuan, and then fell back to 30,300 yuan before trading sideways. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Union Paper remained flat, and the rest of the stocks had mixed results. Bank stocks were mostly buying, while securities stocks were mostly selling. Rubber stocks were still mostly buying.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Meeting Decides on Two Important Matters: Sets Quotas for Yarn and Cloth Transported South; Approves Payment Methods for Warehouse Rent and Other Expenses</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 34th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held at the City Hall at 4:00 pm yesterday. Two important matters were discussed: (1) The February quota for yarn and cloth transported south was approved. The approved quota for yarn and cloth transported south by various manufacturers in February was 3,178 pieces of yarn and 85,251 bolts of cloth. The quota for yarn and cloth transported south under special projects was 2,311 pieces of yarn and 35,287 bolts of cloth. If the remaining quota from February is carried over to March, the total quota for yarn and cloth transported south in March will be 3,550 pieces of yarn and 122,462 bolts of cloth. The total quota for special projects in March is 2,000 pieces of yarn and 85,142 bolts of cloth. Furthermore, regarding the quota for goods transported south set by the meeting, it has been found that a small number of manufacturers are not complying with the regulations and are stamping and certifying the quantity of yarn and cloth transported south for customers, and the quantity sometimes exceeds the regulations, which makes it difficult for the committee to issue permits. After yesterday's discussion, it was requested that the factories no longer exceed the limits, otherwise the factories will be responsible for the consequences. Furthermore, the priority order for issuing permits will henceforth be based on the date recorded on the warehouse receipt held by the applicants. (2) Five articles regarding the government's method for paying warehouse rent and insurance premiums for purchased cotton yarn were approved. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Government's Method for Paying Warehouse Rent and Insurance Premiums for Purchased Cotton Yarn:</p>
<p>(1) The warehouse rent and insurance expenses for cotton yarn purchased by the government, from the day after the warehouse receipt is received to the day it is sold by the Textile Construction Company, will be borne by the committee. The number of pieces of yarn stored by each factory, based on the daily balance sheet of the Textile Construction Company's management office, will be calculated daily in accordance with the warehouse rent and insurance premium rates in Articles 2 and 3 below, and will be summarized and paid monthly.</p>
<p>(2) The warehouse rent will be handled in accordance with the warehouse rates jointly set by the Shanghai Money and Trust Industry Warehouse Association (for example, from February 1, 1947, the monthly warehouse rent per machine-packed yarn will be 3,000 yuan, for tube yarn it will be 1,000 yuan, and for straw-packed yarn it will be 800 yuan).</p>
<p>(3) Insurance matters will be handled by each factory on behalf of the government, and the expenses, regardless of the yarn count or the warehouse building grade, will be temporarily paid by the committee at a rate of 5 per thousand per year based on the purchase price of 20-count yarn in the month of sale.</p>
<p>(4) From the day after the sale by the Textile Construction Company to the tenth day, all warehouse rent and insurance expenses will be free of charge in accordance with the original regulations of each factory. From the eleventh day onwards, the expenses will be borne by the customers, and each factory can charge the customers directly according to the Textile Construction Company's charging standards.</p>
<p>(5) This method will be implemented from the date of its approval by the committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Sentiment Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was even more buoyant, with continuous transactions from the interior. The sentiment was very strong because of this. At the beginning of the morning, prices soared by 100,000. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse Jincheng yarn once broke through the 3.9 million mark, an increase of 160,000 to 170,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine yarn and variable stock yarn also jumped by more than 200,000 yuan. As the market closed, many long positions were settled, causing a slight drop of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, but the trend was still quite stable.</p>
<h3>Interbank Lending Rates Reduced This Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After receiving a letter from the National Bank requesting a reduction in interbank lending rates, the Banking Association and the Money Trade Association held a meeting a few days ago. At the meeting, it was decided to comply with the authorities' intention to reduce interest rates and reduce interbank lending rates for this month to four yuan, which is equivalent to 12 cents per yuan.</p>
<h3>Chen Guangfu Appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Export-to-Guangdong Committee</h3>

<h3>Contract for 9,000 Tons of Frozen Eggs to Be Signed with Britain Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to reliable sources, the contract for a batch of frozen eggs being negotiated between the frozen egg merchants and the British government, totaling 9,000 tons, will be signed within the next few days.

<h3>Raising Sons Seriously</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>A broadcast from London on the 30th presented statistics on the population of England and Wales. It mentioned that the number of infants has exceeded the "replacement level" for the first time in 24 years, expressing optimism. Looking at the numbers listed in the entire article, one is amazed by the seriousness with which the British raise their sons.</p>
<p>"There are three unfilial acts, and the greatest is to have no descendants." This is an ancient saying that we have had for thousands of years. In the early years of the Republic of China, during the high tide of overthrowing the Confucian family, some people advocated non-filial piety, saying "parents did not intentionally raise me." As a result, the ancient saying of "having no descendants" was completely denied by the general intellectual class. However, after a few years, this saying was rediscovered by some eugenic scholars who considered it very reasonable: the reason why China has not perished, and is still a vast and abundant country, especially a populous nation, is due in no small part to this kind of thinking of glorifying ancestors and benefiting descendants. Four hundred and fifty million is indeed a force. We should thank Mencius, who passed down this saying. From this, we can see the serious attitude of Westerners towards bearing and raising children. We Chinese have had this since ancient times. Looking at the efforts of our neighbors to raise sons, we can better understand how we are following this ancient teaching.</p>
<p>It is a pity that we do not have such statistics on infant births as Westerners. Our population figures have been recited like the Three Character Classic for decades and have not changed to this day. One book says 400 million, and another says 450 million, and there is no third new version. Then, how "great" is our so-called "no descendants is the greatest"?</p>
<p>Those who often travel south have probably seen a female beggar; for more than ten years, she has often knelt on the sidewalk begging. Initially, she was a single woman, but later there was a "candle package" infant, and when this child grew up, there was another "candle package." When the second child grew up, a third "candle package" appeared. Thus, the older children were also made to follow behind pedestrians begging. Therefore, the number of children remained at around three or four. "Candle packages" often appeared, but the number of older children did not increase. The female beggar's husband is probably also a filial son who practices "no descendants is the greatest." His ability is to work hard to bear and raise children, but the number of sons and daughters does not continue to increase. That mysterious point is just like our 400 million turning into 450 million. Some people say that if there is not enough effort, this number may decline, which is incomprehensible.</p>
<h3>"Borrow Rice, Return Rice" -- A Farmer A Bao's Poverty Record</h3>
<p>— Meng Ping</p>
<p>"A Bao Rice" is a farmer from a village twenty miles west of Shanghai. He is an only child. When he was born, his parents loved him very much and called him A Bao Rice; people nearby, young and old, all called him A Bao Rice.</p>
<p>A Bao Rice is a self-cultivating farmer who plants fourteen mu of land. His fields are all close to his own residence. He has a mother, wife, and two children. His wife can help him with farming, transplanting rice seedlings, cultivating, carrying burdens, she can do everything. His thirteen-year-old daughter can cut grass to take care of the cattle, and sometimes cut shepherd's purse, alfalfa, and other wild vegetables to bring home for cooking. He does not need to ask for help with any of the labor. He saves money and lives frugally, and the family lives happily together.</p>
<p>The summer before last, A Bao Rice fell ill. He sought gods and worshipped Buddha, Taoist priests exorcised ghosts, he hired doctors and shamans, and got injections and took medicine. In this way, his finances changed, and he had to live beyond his means and borrow to get by.</p>
<p>"Borrow rice, return rice," "borrow wheat, return wheat" – this is the borrowing method of farmers in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area in recent years. Farmers do not understand inflation, and do not understand that the fundamental cause of inflation is the civil war; they only know that goods will slowly rise in price, and paper money will gradually become worthless. Creditors have suffered from "borrow money, return money," and have gradually developed the habit of "borrow goods, return goods." A Bao Rice is no exception, and began to "borrow rice, return rice."</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, A Bao Rice had no money to celebrate the New Year, so he borrowed one dan of rice from the Chen family to sell for money to buy vegetables. On the fifteenth day of the lunar New Year, the couple carried one dan of rice to return to the Chen family. Someone asked, "Why did you return it so quickly?" The Chen family replied, "He borrowed rice from someone else to return it. It's embarrassing to borrow it for a long time, so he had to borrow from A to return to B, and borrow from C to return to A, borrowing and returning in turn, to get through until the new grain comes to market." (This way, you can save on paying interest.) "You have to borrow rice before the lunar new year, and return it when the new grain comes to market, and then you have to borrow rice again at the end of the lunar year, right?" "Yes, the more you borrow, the poorer you get. It's not just him. Some people don't even have rice to eat when the new grain comes to market." "Will they probably have to sell their land in the future?" "Hmm! Maybe."</p>
<p>A Bao Rice, a self-cultivating farmer who is about to become a semi-tenant farmer, has had some changes in his temperament recently. He resents his fate and resents his wife. Sometimes, for small things, the couple even "quarrel."</p>
<h3>The Logic is Good</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Mother — "Hey, Xiao Long, remember, there is a ghost lurking in that dark cupboard where I put the biscuits."</p>
<p>Xiao Long — "It's really strange. Whenever biscuits are missing, you never blame the ghost, you always blame me."</p>
<h3>The Whole Country Goes Mad — A Story</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>This is a story that has been passed down since the Six Dynasties era:</p>
<p>"In the past, there was a country in which there was a river called Zaiquan. The people of the country drank this water, and none were unaffected. Only the ruler of the country dug a well and drew water, and was the only one unaffected. Since the people of the country were all affected, they instead said that the ruler's lack of madness was madness. So they gathered together to discuss and captured the ruler together to cure his madness, using fire, moxa, needles, and medicine, without missing anything. The ruler could not bear the suffering, and also went to the source of the spring, drew water and drank it, and became mad after drinking. Ruler and subjects, high and low, were all mad as one, and the crowd was satisfied!"</p>
<p>This story, although simple, is very interesting. A group of mad people do not realize their madness, but instead say that those who are not mad are mad. It makes right and wrong upside down, and it is extremely absurd!</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that you are clearly not mad, but people insist on saying that you are sick, so they "use fire, moxa, needles, and medicine" and force you to be treated, and the pain is unbearable.</p>
<p>It is like that ruler, who is still a sensible person. He knows that it is useless to persist and does not want to suffer any more injustice, so he drinks Zaiquan and "becomes mad as one." Thus, the emotions of the people are reconciled, and the whole country goes mad! Such a win-win situation, why not do it!</p>
<h3>Living Expenses for Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>— Tian Di Ren</p>
<p>According to reports, in order to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff in schools in the "interior," the Ministry of Education has planned to provide living subsidies to teachers and staff in areas other than Ping, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Dihua, so that their salaries are the same as those in the above five cities, in order to prevent the past phenomenon of talent concentrating in major cities. This issue is of course "very good" in "principle," but how to "implement" it still needs to be worked out by the Executive Yuan in conjunction with the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>At present, the living expenses of teachers and staff, except for a few special areas, are mostly pitiful! Taking Shanghai County, which is adjacent to Shanghai and has repeatedly proposed to be incorporated into the urban area, as an example, the highest basic salary for teachers and staff in national schools is 70 yuan, and the basic amount of the subsidy is 75,000 yuan, 440 times that, which is 105,870 yuan. Although the government has explicitly ordered that the treatment be adjusted from January of this year, stipulating 110,000 yuan for bound books, 750 times that, which is an increase of about 50,000 yuan, the fact is that January is still the old standard, with empty promises but no real benefits; and since the beginning of this semester, not a penny has been issued, which is simply impossible to receive even the old standard, isn't that strange.</p>
<p>It is said that the county government's budget only lists a few central national schools, and the funds for most non-central national schools will be the responsibility of the township chiefs and bailiffs to raise. If this is the case, it is not only close to harsh harassment, but also fully demonstrates the government's lack of solutions to education. Moreover, before fundraising begins, it must go through the legislative procedures of the public opinion institutions, and then be submitted to the province for approval before fundraising can begin. Will fundraising be as smooth and easy as imagined? After fundraising, how will it be kept and used? If the progress is delayed and cannot solve the urgent need, will the teachers and staff be forced to work on an empty stomach? These are all very "brain-wracking" things. (According to reports: Gan Yunshou, an educator from Jiangsu Province, has submitted a report to the Ministry of Education to oppose it.)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's desire to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff is certainly a joyous thing, but the matter is urgent. The sound of footsteps on the stairs has been heard, but hopefully someone will come down soon.</p>

<h3>Record of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The truck that the theater troupe hoped to borrow has, to this day, still not materialized. Although the person in charge of the ×× Commander's Office had indicated that they could allow Old Zhu and all the troupe members to leave with the army when they had to retreat, he saw that the troops going to the front lines to reinforce were so lacking in transportation, and that they were almost always walking on foot, so he did not dare to imagine what the situation would be like when they retreated. Also, Lan and the two children's travel problem had not been resolved. Since Xu Shaoming's wife returned from Liuzhou, living in the Xu family was really no more comfortable than being on the front lines. That tall and thin Shandong wife raised her voice all day long, and spoke to everyone she met; if it weren't for Lan's attitude towards Xu Shaoming being so disgusted and cold, this wife would have long since gotten jealous and caused a ruckus.</p>
<p>Lan had already decided not to wait for that endlessly delayed remittance, but she had never asked Xu Shaoming or Zhu Zhaonian to find her a ride; she disdained to ask the former, and was somewhat afraid to ask the latter.</p>
<p>Xiao Shen, who wanted to be very attentive to her, had a fantasy, hoping that he could get a small chartered car alone and take Lan and Feifei and Rong'er straight to Guiyang. But since Mrs. Xu Shaoming arrived the day before yesterday, his activities had been restricted. That tall and thin Mrs. Xu, the general manager, who walked like a man, was monitoring him with all her might, even more carefully than she monitored her own husband. If she didn't see him for ten minutes, she would raise her voice and shout "Xiao Shen, Xiao Shen" in her Shandong accent, which made Xiao Shen's heart and soul tremble. He deeply regretted that he should not have been so happy in Liuzhou and hooked up with this ogress. At the same time, he, Xiao Shen, a young master with the appearance of a movie star, really couldn't be as resourceful as the associate managers and Xu Shaoming in Guilin at this time; with all his strength, he might be able to get two or three people standing room only on the covered wagons chartered by the four national banks to the Xiang-Gui Railway, but he had no hope of getting a chartered car. After being turned down three or four times in different ways, he could only obediently give up this idea, although he couldn't help but strike up a few conversations every time he saw Lan.</p>
<p>In the past two or three days, Lan herself had been very busy running around. She went to see a former classmate from art school – now the wife of Secretary Huang of the provincial government, and another cousin of Lan's, a middle-level employee in the Xiang-Gui Railway Bureau. That Secretary's wife didn't forget the old days and actually agreed to take Lan's family to Mengshan on the provincial government's convenience boat, but this was different from Lan's purpose, so she could only politely decline her kindness. That cousin was a poor civil servant, but he still completely retained a human heart. He used all his strength to buy two first-class tickets to Liuzhou for Lan, but he couldn't get on the train several times, because most of the trains had been requisitioned to transport troops, and the passenger trains that were scheduled to depart were temporarily canceled.

<h3>Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Fan Quan</p>
<p>I think that Principal Lu of our New Life Elementary School is the fattest person in the world, but he insists on wearing a Zhongshan suit that is too short and too small. The pant legs only go down to his calves, and the buttons on the collar are so tight that they squeeze the flesh of his fat throat out. Whenever he speaks, because the collar is too tight and he feels uncomfortable, he always uses his fat right hand to pull and press on the collar, then quickly retracts his head and neck, swallows his saliva, raises his head, and then speaks. Every time I see Principal Lu speaking, I get so anxious: don't break the buttons on that collar!</p>
<p>For example, today, Principal Lu is swallowing saliva again, so I am anxious again, but I hold my breath and watch quietly. I see him retracting his head and neck, then raising his head, and saying to us in his "standard Mandarin":</p>
<p>"Esteemed children: Today, this today, is April 4th, is this Children's Day. This this, Children's Day, is this the holiday of the children. And this Children's Day, in this one year, this this, there is only this one day, only this, April 4th. So this school, so this principal, for this Children's Day, for you children, will accompany you to have this some fun. Today in this park, it is free, but, this private park, this this, if this children this are not dressed neatly, that is to say, if this clothes are too dirty, that is, will this—not be allowed to enter. But this school, but this principal, can guarantee to everyone, can guarantee this everything, this the children of this school, all this are particular about cleanliness, so this this principal, the day before yesterday has already contacted this Erly Garden to play, contacted this World Theater to see a movie, sigh, um, this this, see a movie, see this, see this movie."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, our Principal Lu kept stretching his head and neck, kept swallowing his saliva, and kept using his fat hand to pull and press on his collar. Oh my, I'm really worried, don't let the button on that collar fly off with a "pop," but I hope that if it flies off, it will fly back immediately, fly onto his collar, like a fly, as long as it circles around, it will still hide in its original place, so that Principal Lu can continue to speak.</p>
<p>But Principal Lu could no longer speak, he stretched his head and neck, retracted his head and neck, but could no longer "this." Then what can be done if he can't "this"? Could it be that we are going to sit with Principal Lu and "this" all day?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the physical education teacher, Mr. Jiang, walked onto the podium. He stood next to Principal Lu and continued:</p>
<p>"Alright, you've all heard what Principal Lu just said. Now we'll start out, first visit Erly Garden, and then go to the World Theater at 2:30 to see a movie. So now we'll start, what does the principal think?"</p>
<p>"This this..." Principal Lu nodded, indicating his agreement.</p>
<p>So we lined up and walked out of the school.</p>
<p>When our line was about to reach Erly Garden, Xiao Gouzi saw me and shouted loudly –</p>
<p>"Qi Xiaohua!"</p>
<p>I turned around and saw Xiao Gouzi, who was dragging his snot and barefoot, throwing bricks on the road. Xiao Gouzi is our neighbor, his father is a mason, and he goes out barefoot early in the morning and doesn't come back until late at night. When he comes back, he is covered in mud and ash, and sometimes his face is covered in patches of white lime. Xiao Gouzi's mother works as a maid in our house. So Xiao Gouzi often comes to our house to play with me, and sometimes I even teach Xiao Gouzi to read, and I'm Xiao Gouzi's little teacher.</p>
<p>I was so happy to see Xiao Gouzi today! I waved to Xiao Gouzi, and Xiao Gouzi ran over immediately.</p>
<p>Xiao Gouzi walked with me, his shoulder next to mine.</p>
<p>I deliberately lowered my voice and said to Xiao Gouzi:</p>
<p>"Hey, Xiao Gouzi, do you know that today is Children's Day!"</p>
<p>Xiao Gouzi was stunned, he thought for a long time, and then asked me seriously:</p>
<p>"What is an ear-bucket day? Does a bucket not have a day? I saw my dad's mason bucket, made of wood, and they all have days."</p>
<p>"Hey, Xiao Gouzi, you don't even know what Children's Day is?" I felt a little sorry for Xiao Gouzi, I said in a low voice, "Children's Day is a good day for us children!"</p>
<p>"But I haven't gone to school, my dad doesn't have money, I can only be a wild child, I'm not your 'child'!"</p>
<p>I felt very sad when I heard Xiao Gouzi's words, but I comforted Xiao Gouzi, I said:</p>
<p>"All children are children, and children should have a good day today!"</p>
<p>"What kind of good day?"</p>
<p>"Play in the garden, watch a movie."</p>
<p>"Can I go in with you too?"</p>
<p>"You can go in too."</p>
<p>Xiao Gouzi was so happy to hear this, he jumped and hopped, took my hand, and squeezed in front of me, lining up in our line.</p>
<p>At this time, our line had reached the gate of Erly Garden. Principal Lu and Mr. Jiang told us to stop, they walked to the gate and talked to the gatekeeper for a while, and then Mr. Jiang walked over, stood in front of our line, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Attention—right turn—count off!"</p>
<p>Hearing Mr. Jiang's loud shout, Xiao Gouzi was stunned. He immediately moved his feet stealthily and walked outside the line, like a passing child, curiously looking at us.</p>
<p>After the count-off was completed, Mr. Jiang issued the order again:</p>
<p>"Left turn—march!"</p>
<p>So thirty-six children walked through the gate of Erly Garden.</p>
<p>Only Xiao Gouzi, he stood there blankly, standing at the gate, watching us one by one walk into the gate of the garden.</p>
<p>Our line was disbanded, and the children went in groups of twos and threes to play by the pond and in the rockery. I was full of anger: why not let Xiao Gouzi come in and play together?</p>
<p>At one o'clock, Mr. Jiang blew his whistle to gather the children, line them up, and walk out of Erly Garden to go to the World Theater to see a movie.</p>
<p>When the line passed the corner of Foch Road and Albert Road, Xiao Gouzi stealthily walked beside me again. He said somewhat reproachfully:</p>
<p>"I waited outside, why did you play for so long?"</p>
<p>I was full of shame, what could I say to Xiao Gouzi? Why didn't I ask Mr. Jiang to let Xiao Gouzi come in too? Why didn't I... After thinking about it, I always felt too sorry for Xiao Gouzi, so I said:</p>
<p>"Xiao Gouzi, let's go see a movie, don't be afraid this time, come in with me!"</p>
<p>Xiao Gouzi was so moved when he heard my words that his face turned red, he immediately looked at his clothes and asked me doubtfully:</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Really!" I answered straightforwardly.</p>
<p>So Xiao Gouzi joined our line again. This time he was behind me. I kept turning back to talk to him. I saw Xiao Gouzi walking carefully, he wiped away the two old snot streaks with his sleeve, and then patted the mud and ash off his body with his palms. From Xiao Gouzi's actions, I saw how confident and happy Xiao Gouzi felt.</p>
<p>The line stopped in front of the World Theater. After Principal Lu "this this" negotiated with the ticket collector for a while, we walked into the theater one by one according to the lined up line.</p>
<p>The ticket collector counted the number of people: "One, two..."</p>
<p>When I was about to pass in front of the ticket collector, the two ticket collectors almost simultaneously roared loudly –</p>
<p>"Hmph! You little rascal!"</p>
<p>I turned around and saw two ticket collectors grabbing the collar of Xiao Gouzi's ragged clothes with four strong hands, dragging him out of the line and slapping him hard. When they dragged Xiao Gouzi to the stone steps at the entrance of the theater, one of the ticket collectors kicked Xiao Gouzi's butt hard with his right leg, and Xiao Gouzi cried out "Wow" and, like a carrot, fell and rolled from the eight stone steps all the way to the road.</p>
<p>I hurried out, ran to Xiao Gouzi's side, and helped the crying Xiao Gouzi up. I kept saying, "He is my friend, he is my friend!"</p>
<p>At this time, Principal Lu and Mr. Jiang also rushed to my side. Mr. Jiang grabbed my hand, and with a stern face, said:</p>
<p>"He is a little rascal, he is not our friend!"</p>
<p>I was very unhappy when I heard these words, so I said:</p>
<p>"He is my neighbor friend, I want him to watch a movie with me."</p>
<p>"This this," the fat Principal Lu also anxiously touched his collar with his fat hands, "This this, he is not qualified to watch this movie."</p>
<p>"Why?" I said with a crying face: "Why? Isn't today Children's Day? Can't all the children in the world play together today? Isn't today..."</p>
<p>"This this, Children's Day is this Children's Day, but this—that Children's Day is not this Children's Day..."</p>
<p>Principal Lu and Mr. Jiang dragged me into the theater, but for "Children's Day," for our good day, I couldn't help but cry loudly.</p>

<p>And wear such ragged clothes?</p>
<p>We want to understand clearly,</p>
<p>This world we live in.</p>
<p>Haha, you think we are annoying,</p>
<p>That the questions we ask are not worth half a cent, and you are speechless!</p>
<p>To the Children of Zhuang Village</p>
<p>I, a farmer who has lost his land, am like a bird with broken wings, falling on the grassland where you live. I know that it is difficult for me to soar in the blue sky again, so; your grassland has become my home.</p>
<p>As soon as I crossed the threshold of your kingdom, I was amazed and regretted the past, the past, that series of lives that were not lives, tormented me, causing worldliness and hypocrisy to bury my emotions. It made me sob as I held up my insulted and trampled soul. And this time, resting by the cradle of your emotions, seeing your true purity and frankness, innocence and selflessness, my conscience, immersed in tears, smiled and returned to childhood.</p>
<p>You—the lights and flowers of the world! How can the world do without you? Just as I cannot do without the sincere emotions of the world to brighten my dark life, even if I am a farmer who has lost his land, a snail with shrunken antennae, and living on this green land of yours, I also joyfully rub my calloused hands and raise my hoe while sweating!</p>
<p>And I, no longer like the past, my eyes chasing the passing white clouds, my mouth chewing on the bitter fruit of emptiness and loneliness, wandering in the desolate forest in autumn, carrying broken fallen leaves, and softly chanting poems of late-year heartbreak! Because in cultivation, I have the hope of harvest, and in emotion, I have the harvest of hope; the seed drill of my ideals is rolling again on this fertile land.</p>
<p>But on this trembling ancient land, people! are like a small boat on the ocean, constantly being tossed and battered by the wind and waves. A week ago, during the days when the wind and rain struck, I briefly bid farewell to you, holding your budding soil, and you actually thought that I would not return, and your tears, along with the raindrops, soaked my luggage and my heart. When I walked very far and far away and looked back again, you, a group of young send-offs, were still standing foolishly in the rain, like a group of small wooden chickens who had lost their mother hen. ... And when I returned to your presence again, you were like a swarm of bees; clustered around me. ...</p>
<p>Alas! Why would I be willing to leave you? Today, I feel that leaving you is an impossible and cruel thing. But what can I do? I fly up and fall down, fall down and fly up. ...</p>
<p>Today, I am carrying the heavy emotions you have given me, and it is most difficult to leave you. When I leave you, I have a small part of the joy of a mother bird flying out of the nest to look for food, I have a large part of the joy of a navigator setting sail; but I also have a share of the sadness of a farmer who has lost his land again!</p>
<p>Don't shed those bright and sparkling pearl tears for me anymore, and don't wish me to go out safely and return safely! When I wander in a foreign land, whether I have obtained a piece of land to cultivate or not, I want to obtain news of the harvest on your land, and I will always sing the songs of sprouting on this land. ...</p>
<h3>Celebrating Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Every year, this day broadcasts new sounds,</p>
<p>Again, the joyous Children's Festival arrives.</p>
<p>Flowers bloom and water flows, life is invigorated,</p>
<p>Kites fly and fish leap, sharing a profound joy.</p>
<p>Endless vitality in the footsteps of spring,</p>
<p>An innocent heart unstained by the world's dust.</p>
<p>Cherishing the hope of nation-building in the next generation,</p>
<p>Future steeds, though not yet fully grown, advance rapidly.</p>
<h3>On Children's Art Education</h3>
<p>I remember on June 6, 1936, at the stadium in the new city area of Jiangwan—the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, in order to "promote children's art education," specially entrusted the Municipal Education Bureau, the China Art Education Society, the China Child Welfare Association, and five other organizations to organize a "National Children's Art Exhibition." There were twenty-four participating units, with a total of over 40,000 works on display, a grand and dazzling sight. Unexpectedly, it became an unprecedented and unsurpassed feat!</p>
<p>Until today, ten years have passed. Although everything was brought to a standstill and destruction due to the eight-year war of resistance, the final victory has finally arrived. Everything is shouting slogans of "rehabilitation," "revival," and "establishment," but only "children's art education" is barely mentioned. What a regrettable thing this is!</p>
<p>"Art education" has been implemented in primary schools for nearly twenty years. Although there were many shortcomings in the past, making it difficult to fully satisfy people, it was much more vigorous compared to the current situation.</p>
<p>"Art" has a great function in enlightening children's spirituality—it not only expresses the inherent love of beauty in human beings, but also cultivates bad tempers; it not only fosters creative habits, but also enhances good virtues. These are all things that children themselves cannot discover or actively apply. Therefore, I have to put forward the following suggestions for those responsible for educating children:</p>
<p>"Children's art education," first and foremost, should enable children to appreciate beauty and inspire their aesthetic interests. To achieve intangible aesthetic education, it is necessary to create a beautiful environment around children's daily lives—clothing, food, shelter, transportation, and even schools and classrooms, as well as the toys that children need, must all be carefully considered, because these are all sufficient to increase children's appreciation and recognition of beauty.</p>
<p>For example, clothes don't need to be made of good materials, just be well-fitting and clean, and that is beauty. Food doesn't need to be plentiful, just eat the right amount at the right time and place, and that is beauty... These are all things that parents and teachers need to arrange and guide.</p>
<p>Secondly, how to enable children to learn and cultivate their innate ability to love beauty and create—visit exhibitions, and use art to replace their crude and vulgar games.</p>
<p>Thirdly, how to enable children to pursue beauty and create an upward mentality—look at the works of famous people, watch the biographies of famous artists, and even tell simple art stories and art history, so that they have a basic concept of art (especially the art of our country, which has a long history of thousands of years). It is not enough to simply copy paintings and draw a few gourds.</p>
<p>The above points: have been promoted with considerable success in Western Europe and Japan. I hope that in China, this work will not be taken lightly. I especially hope that the teachers responsible for children's education, in addition to paying attention to children's physical health, must also cultivate children's mental health.</p>
<h3>"Our Holiday"?</h3>
<p>— Yang Gonghuai</p>
<p>Today is the happy Children's Day,</p>
<p>Little Sanzi heard a string of good news:</p>
<p>What——</p>
<p>You can watch movies in the theater without paying;</p>
<p>You can rest your legs in the park without buying a ticket;</p>
<p>The candies in the store are all discounted;</p>
<p>The children's clothing in the company is also on sale;</p>
<p>There are also many fun places,</p>
<p>I heard they are also inviting us for a treat!</p>
<p>He couldn't care less about the scary face of "Uncle,"</p>
<p>He sneaked to the street and strode forward,</p>
<p>No matter what, he has to have a good time:</p>
<p>He ran to the theater,</p>
<p>The receptionist said, "It's already full!"</p>
<p>He ran to the park,</p>
<p>The policeman at the gate cursed him as a little rascal,</p>
<p>Not allowing him to take another look inside.</p>
<p>All the stores, companies, and entertainment venues,</p>
<p>Are crowded with young masters and young ladies.</p>
<p>There are many companions like him at the door!</p>
<p>At this time,</p>
<p>Little Sanzi's heart was cold.</p>
<p>He understood, everywhere welcomes:</p>
<p>Are the young masters and young ladies from wealthy families,</p>
<p>Not us children in ragged clothes.</p>
<p>He returned to "Uncle" dejectedly,</p>
<p>"Little devil, sneaking out to play, now you're happy?</p>
<p>"Slap!" A big slap came down,</p>
<p>Little Sanzi suffered a great injustice, and tears streamed down his face!</p>
<p>A burst of singing came from the street:</p>
<p>"Children's Day,</p>
<p>Full of joy,</p>
<p>Today is our holiday,</p>
<p>Everywhere is filled with laughter!</p>
<p>Today is our holiday,</p>
<p>Everywhere is filled with laughter!"</p>
<p>Little Sanzi covered his mouth, wiped away his tears,</p>
<p>And muttered softly:</p>
<p>"I've had enough today,</p>
<p>Who wants to listen to your nonsense!"</p>
<h3>A School Story</h3>
<p>— Xiao Jue</p>
<p>I started school at the age of six. At that time, in the small town where I lived, there were two kinds of schools. One was a private school, where they only read books like the Analects and Mencius; the other was a school, but at that time, people mostly called it "Western-style school." One of my cousins was a conservative person. He strongly opposed my going to "Western-style school," saying that "Western-style school" was "disorderly," but my mother's opinion was the opposite of my cousin's, not wanting me to go to a private school to read dead books. But in the end, following my cousin's opinion, I entered a private school very close to my home.</p>
<p>The day I started school was an "auspicious day." This was selected by my cousin after spending a lot of time. My grandmother's family sent a lot of cakes, zongzi, and a green satin satchel embroidered with carp jumping over the dragon gate. In addition, there was a stool that had been prepared long ago, a red-lacquered stool that shone brightly. On the legs of the stool was tied a sprig of evergreens. What does it mean? I still don't understand, but it is probably a kind of "good luck." Under the stool, there were also sugar cakes, which were said to be stuck so that the child would sit still and study, and would not play around. Because the sugar cakes are sticky, they stick the child's butt. Thinking about it now, it's really ridiculous.</p>
<p>That day, I wore a long robe and short jacket, dressed like a "little gentleman." I was accompanied by my uncle to the private school. Because it was the first time going to school, I had to give the old classmates sugar tea. The meaning of this was said to be that in the future, we would be able to study together harmoniously. So we were followed by a maid, who carried a large pot of sugar tea, ready to be distributed to the students in the private school. Just as we walked into the alley leading to that private school, we saw many heads inside shaking and reciting books. Stepping into the study, the sound of reading suddenly quieted down, and dozens of small eyes focused on me. I was so shy that I hid behind my uncle.</p>
<p>My uncle took me to bow to the teacher, and then bowed to Confucius. Then I sat on the bright red-lacquered stool, staring blankly at the maid distributing sugar tea to the classmates.</p>
<p>This private school, perhaps influenced by the "Western-style school," had also become new. Below the statue of Confucius hanging in the center of the study, there was also a portrait of the Founding Father, and on both sides, there were also two Qing Tian Bai Ri flags with who knows how many angles.</p>
<p>In this way, I mingled among a group of children and slowly learned to shake my head and recite books. (Revised in February, 1947)</p>
