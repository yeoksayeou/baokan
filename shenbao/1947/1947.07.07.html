<h3>七七抗戰十週紀念主席廣播昭告全民　喚醒洞察奸謀奮起戡亂</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕蔣主席於（七七）抗戰十週年紀念前夕，向全國廣播，原詞如下：　全國同胞們今天是我們七七抗戰十週年紀念日，我覺得對抗戰勝利以來我們國家局勢的變遷和民族整個的危機，以及同胞們禍福利害的關鍵，有向我全國同胞鄭重說明的必要。　我們對日抗戰的目的，原在於捍衛國土，收復東北，保持主權和領土的完整。東北的主權和領土行政一天沒有恢復，便是抗戰的目的沒有達到，我們爲杭戰而犧牲的千萬軍民的英靈，就無由慰藉，這完全是我們後死者共同的責任。大家都知道，在日本投降以前，東北是沒有中共匪軍的，及至國軍進入東北接收領發主權的時候，在這一年半中間，共匪竟對國軍先後發動了五次的攻勢，圍攻政府已經接收了的地區，割裂東北的土地，屠戮東北的人民。最近國民參政會的和平建議，共黨的反響首先是經過他宣傳機關的詈駡誣衊，接着便在關內外發動瘋在的攻勢，來作事實上的答覆，特別是他這次對東北的攻勢，規模之大，前所未有。五月初旬以來，他發動了三十萬以上的兵力，向各重要據點作猛烈攻擊，最後把攻擊重點集中於四平街，以十倍於守軍的兵力，展開了十八畫夜慘烈的攻擊，卒賴我將士繼續對日抗戰的精神，對來犯的共匪予以殲減的打擊，而粉碎了他包圍長吉，奪取潘陽的企岡，使東北戰局得到一個成敗的轉捩點，但是，共匪毀減祖國一貫的陰謀，決不會從此罷手，所以東北的危機並不能說因四平街的勝利而根本解除。共匪是怎樣的進入東北，他在東北參加叛亂的部隊，又是怎樣編組成立的，這都是盡人皆知，很明顯的。共黨是繼承了帝國主義者日本和偽滿漢奸的衣缽，他正在執行帝國主義者日本減亡中國所未曾貫澈而遺留下來的毒計，不許我中華民族恢復東北的主權，不讓我們中華民國享有領土和行政的完整，而且他到今天還在利用我們敵軍日本殘餘的部隊，帶領了他們來蹂躪我們中國的土地，殘害我們中國的人民。共匪這種倒行逆施，喪心病狂的作爲，比之歷史上任何流寇盜匪都要兇殘，他的居心，比之中國歷史上所有漢奸傀儡都要狠毒。同胞們須知，共黨這樣的軍事叛亂，就是要分裂我們整個中國，斷送我們整個民族，他必要使我們民族的精神和固有的道德消減凈蓋，使我們神明華胃生生世世永遠淪爲奴隸牛馬，不能保有獨立自由的人格，這種破壞人性，減絕人倫的獸行共匪，如果任其繼續存在，那我們黃帝子孫便要受到最近亡國各民族一樣的集體殺戮，集體放逐與永遠奴隸的慘禍。</p>
<p>共黨叛國的禍心　不爲感召而覺悟</p>
<p>我們國民革命的目的，是要建立一個獨立自由，民有民治民享的三民主義新中國，而總國的工作必以國家的和平統一爲前提，但是和平與統一是不可分的，統一與民主自由是不可分的，統」與人民幸福更是不可分的，國家如果不能統一，則一切建國理想，都成空談，民族權民生活生主義就都無法實現，人民在地方被蹂躪，經濟被割據，生產被破壞，交通被阻斷的狀况之下，決不能得到水準以上的生活，同胞們必能回憶「大戰甫吿終結，內爭不容再有」，這是我在勝利以後對共產黨所發的眞擊的呼聲，任何有責任心的政府以及有愛國心的人民，都不願在大戰後瘡痍滿目之餘，使國家與人民重陷於戰禍的痛苦，我們並不想否認共產主義成爲一種學說或思想，我們當時只希望共產黨遵循民主的途徑，像英·美各民主國家的共產黨一樣，以和平合法的政黨，來爭取選民，所以十年以來尤其在過去一多的時間，政府對於共產黨是始終的苦心忍讓，委曲求全，祇希望共黨不破壞統一，不擁兵割擄，不推翻國本，不斷喪民命，一致爲和平民主建設而奮鬥，政府都可畫量容納他們的意見。但是，任何的商談協議和調處，終不能消弭他們叛國的禍心，終無法感召他們爲國家前途和民生痛苦而覺悟。共黨匪軍一年多來的主要行動，無不集中於破壞交通，破壞工礦，而且到處破壞奄奄一息的農村。政府每一次呼籲和平，每一次頒發停職令，只有助長共黨匪軍更進一步的擴張和進攻，只有增加國軍綫的困難，只有增多忠勇將士和人民的犧牲，也只有把匪息擴大，戰禍延長，使戰後社會復與重建的工作，比以前更陷於艱難無比的困境。到了現在，我全國同胞可以明白認識共黨是「匪性難移」，絕沒有悔禍的誠意，是決定要叛亂到底的，他的野心陰謀，非斷送國家，貽害世界是決不會停止的，我們如不能舉國一致洞察奸謀，抱定決心，戡平叛亂，那不祇民生日益凋敝，而整個國家也要被他割裂斷送，淪胥以盡了。</p>
<h3>今日如袖手旁觀　將來即束手待斃</h3>
<p>共黨在抗戰結束後，公開叛變，本來是他們早已確定的陰謀，當我們抗戰勝利之時，他就在匪區內公然的發動其所謂「參軍運動」和「社會鬥爭」，「民衆淸算」，以强暴和刧持的方式，專以殘忍的殺戮立咸，上自老嫗，下至意穉，一粟一布，不容保留，一草一木，都被劫奪，爲他叛國的暴力，匪區內所有壯丁，不隨他爲匪，就別無生存之途，稍有違抗，就凌割活埋，實行他所謂「一人逃亡全家處死」的暴刑，匪區內成千成萬的同胞，就是這樣的被共匪驅逐着，作了他們叛國害民的犧牲品。</p>
<p>但是在我們後方的，尤其是在華中·華南各大都市，還有許多人沒有認識國家民族的根本危機，沒有着淸共黨窮兇極惡的暴行，或徼倖姑息，或苟且偷安，不知道我們後方同胞今天尙得保持其經常的生活方式，全賴我們爲剿匪救民而犧牲的國軍將士在前綫奮鬥阻退之力，否則就早已陷入華北·東北共區內民衆一樣的悲境。因之，我們如果今日削弱了國軍，就是動搖了全國人民的基本生存權利，正因爲我們後方同胞還不能明察這種禍福利害的事貿，於是共匪就利用社會上苟且偷安，因循姑息的心理，指使其反動工具，提出「反對征糧」，「反對征兵」，「反對內戰」等各種口號，來顚倒黑白，麻醉人心，　惑社會，搖動國本，使我們的人力·物力乃至情神的力量，，都不能集中應用到剿匪和建設的工作上去，坐視共匪暴力長大，叛亂因而蔓延，迫本溯源，不能不說是我們社會人士中了共匪反宣傳的毒計。要知道，共匪爲了遂行他背叛國家民族的陰謀，首先他必須閉塞我們同胞的耳目，麻醉我們同胞的良知，共匪的目的，就是要使我同胞對於民族大義完全不明，對於國家危亡視若無覩，甚至對於自身禍福與永久利害亦茫然無知，由此喪失了自强·自立與獨立自主的信心，無形之間，成了共匪精神上的俘虜。今天社會上是非不分，利害不辨的這種麻痺狀態，正是共匪所欲造成的，這正如古語所說燕雀巢於危幕之下，而不自知其危，實際上覆巢之下，決無完卵。同胞們，今天的袖手旁觀，就是他日的束手待斃，待到像匪區同胞那樣，已入陷阱，求生不得，求死不能的時候，雖欲後悔，也已無及了。我們國家和全國同胞的命運，實際已臨到了這樣嚴重的危機，我怎麼能不負實明吿喚起全體同胞一致的警覺。</p>
<h3>面前只有兩條路　望同胞立刻抉擇</h3>
<p>同胞們要知道，現在我們中國擺在面前的，只有兩條道路，我希望我們同胞立刻有所抉擇，一條是因循貽誤，袖手旁觀，坐待共匪宰割蹂躪，使整個國家和四萬萬五千萬同胞淪胥陸沉以亡的道路。一條是正視事實，認淸禍福，明辯利害，自立自强，一致奮起，肅淸匪患，救國自救的道路。我們究竟還是共同一致，全力戡亂，保持國家領土主權，完成統一，以期達到民主自由的目的呢？還是坐視匪軍猖獗，叛亂蔓延，護自己的家鄉被刧奪，家族受凌辱，子弟被驅迫，做賣國的工具，而最後斷送了國家命脈呢？我們全體同胞要想想，東北，華北遭受匪禍的同胞所過的是怎樣的日子，在東北經過了十多年淪亡奴辱的苦痛，而勝利所帶來的，乃是共黨匪軍的恐怖。壓迫。刧奪·屠戮·代替了日本帝國主義的强暴統治。至於華北各地，在抗戰期問，犧牲最大，受苦最深，在抗戰勝利後，許多地區的同胞喘息未定，又遭到共匪的侵入，重新墜入黑暗的深淵。最近，共匪在各地所發動的攻勢，都是匪軍驅這其所謂「民兵」在前，大車騾馬在後，兇鋒所過，裏脅擄掠，鷄犬不留，有過於抗戰時期敵人的三光政策。每逢共匪侵佔了一惆據點，則成萬的民衆只有拋棄一切，冒着危險，向國軍陣地後方來歸，其呼號怨憤之聲，極人間之慘事，我們後方同胞和他們都是一脈相承，同氣連枝的兄弟，對於他們的命運，怎麼可熱視無覩，對於他們的災難，怎麼能不急起直追的趕速挽救。並且匪軍的全面叛亂，是一以減亡整個中國，奴役全體同胞一爲目的，我們如不能萬衆一心剿匪戡亂，則今天東北·華北陷匪區域同胞慘無天日的生活，就是我們華中·華南同胞們不久將來的生活寫照。</p>
<h3>今天的戡亂剿匪　實在是自救自衛</h3>
<p>我們復員未竣，阻礙迭乘，我深深知道在我們收復區內一般同胞生活的艱難，尤其是農村農民的困苦，不堪言狀，但不論如何，比之受匪禍區域的同胞生活。行動·精神·物質同受剝奪沉淪之痛，乃至一呼，一吸，一言，一動都被壓迫，父子夫婦之間，也要互相提防，不敢傾訴痛苦的悲境，究有天淵之別。可知今天我們全國軍民同胞的戡亂剿匪，不但是拯救匪區同胞，實在就是自救自衛，如果在共匪的企圖已經這樣明顯的時候，還是因循却顧，冷淡傍觀，任令匪軍蔓延猖獗，而還不能對國家，對同胞負責盡職，努力奮起，遏減叛亂，那便是甘心斷送自己的身家性命，何况我們經過八年堅貞卓絕的抗戰，受畫了萬苦千辛，犧牲了千萬軍民的生命，如果任令共黨能軍得逞他幸災樂禍的陰謀，叛國殃民的野心，毀減我們全國軍民抗戰光榮的歷史，替日本帝國主義者執行其減亡中國未完的工作，那我們撫心自問，又何以對自身當時奮起抗戰的初衷，何以對無數殉難軍民先烈的英靈。</p>

<h3>動用五億美元貸欵事　美開始審查我計劃　初步行動已透露有喬微象</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕據六日政府官員稱：進出口銀行，對中國早前爲動用五億美元信用貸款而提出之大批開發計劃，業已開始行動。據稱：此項計劃擱置於國務院辦公桌上已歷一月以上，本週初始由中國大使顧維鈞携往進出口銀行。顧大使將此項計劃送往進口銀行，乃表示此項建議之計劃，已有新的發展。至少在事前該銀行總經理馬丁會有聲明，謂將對該項計劃，予以個別愼重考慮。</p>
<p>政府另一部分人士稱：該銀行業已開始行動，但尙須經過較畏時間始可作決定。渠等解釋稱：該銀行除分別研究每一建議外，並將普遍研究中國經濟情况。財政工程，法律，及一般經濟方面之專家，將輪流審查各項計劃，然後決定是否允許貸款。屆時此項計劃將送交全國財政顧問會審核。該會由進出口銀行，財政部，國務院，及商務部之代表組成。同時中國駐美大使館，中國資源委員會及中國供應代表團之官員，隨時在旁協助，如有需要時，對財政顧問會供給情報。</p>
<p>中美雙方消息靈通方面稱：進出口銀行可能對運輪計劃，儘先予以考慮，蓋最符合於該銀行本身之先決條件，即任何新貨款，必須能做到增進出口貿易之目的。其次，將注意於最能帮助中國自力更生之計劃。</p>

<h3>陳總長告全國官兵　剿匪爲革命軍人未了職責</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕參謀總長陳誠，爲七七紀念，發表吿全國官兵書，要點爲：今日本雖敗，而東北領士生權因共匪阻礙未能接收，即抗戰目的尙未圓滿達成，亦即我革命軍人職責未了。現政府動員全國力量，戡平叛亂，即希全國袍澤澈底奉行戡亂政策，以拯匪區人民，鞏固國家統一。吾人今後中心工作，一切爲剿匪，一切爲勝利。蔣主席訓示，革命已瀕嚴重關頭，亦我軍人殺敵報國良機，不可稍有猶疑，而自失信心，尤須知共匪之亂非偶然，實革命進程中必然的遭遇。今已至國民革命之第二期，其工作中心在實行民權，民生主義，而其對象即爲掃除共匪惡勢力之障礙，現革命力量已超過一切腐惡勢力，只要切實提高警覺，勝利必可早致。</p>

<h3>主席廣播詞全文　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>剿匪戡亂工作　爲了國家利益</p>
<p>所以，今天的戡亂剿匪，是爲了國家最高的利益，也爲了人民的基本生存和民主自由的權利，而興共匪奮鬥，這和對口抗戰神聖的意義，並無二致。換句話說，今日剿匪工作，就是繼續對日抗戰未完的任務，也正如我對同胞們所說的要確保抗議勝利成果，獲得國家民族眞正獨立自由所必須經過的奮鬥，我們國革將士前仆後繼，英勇慘烈的犧牲，應與抗戰先烈獲得同樣崇高的尊敬，而足食足兵，充實前綫軍事，乃爲我四萬萬五千萬同胞每一個人無可旁貸的義務，在救國保民的意義上，不論任何地域，無分前方後方，都是休威相關，存亡與共的。我要嚴正的昭吿我們同胞，從最最近東北戰役中，可以看出距軍野心完全暴露，國家危機日益加重，因此，大家不能再存任何　倖有安的幻想，不能再有置身軍外的態度，必須急起直追，統一意志，集中力量，軍民一致，加強剿匪實力，加强建設工作，爲國家掃除這一個百世的　很，我們要以抗戰時期同樣的精神，實行全體總動員，並且要格外振奮，格外嚴整，來改正抗戰時期所發生的缺點。我們要毫無遲疑，毫無保留的，貢獻一切人力，物力，和生命，共同努力於救國家，救同胞，戡亂定變的戰事，如此纔能保　對日抗戰勝利的成果，國家才有獨立自由，社會才有重獲安全的希望。</p>
<p>總動員的意義　喚起全民警覺</p>
<p>同胞們，國民政府業已下令，實行　匪總動員了，這次總動員最重大的意義，是在喚起全國人民的警覺，統一全國人民的意志，集中全國人民的力量，我們要號召全國愛國民衆一致奮起、救國目救，歡府一初措施，必循法定的軌轍，而且完全信任我們同胞的愛國良知，使全國同胞在民族大義之下，自動自發的報效國家。但是我們國民必須人人愛國自愛，遵守國傢的法律，竭盡國民的職守，對於與劇匪有關的任務，都要　　優　悉力以赴，無論一舉一動，都要裨益剿匪與建設工作的進行。社會上有地位的各界領袖，更應　先急公赴義，爲天下倡。我全國靑年們，是國家民族命脈所　託，尤其要明辨是非，認定順逆，發楊國家意識，保障民族生命，如果靑年們甘心爲共匪作工具，不惜使國家淪亡，民　滅絕則已，否則，大家應人人自認爲黃帝的子孫，中國的國民，爲中華民族求得獨立生存，使自己將來能發揮生自由的思想，不受共匪的摧殘　迫，那就要立定決心，共赴國早，求學的專心求學，爲農工商的要努力生產，增加國力，各守崗位，各盡職責，使後方壯會秩序絕對的安定，我全國叛變和他澈底破壞社會秩序是互相呼應，互相配合的。</p>
<p>尊重人民權利　但不姑息養奸</p>
<p>自從我們對日抗戰以來，共黨始終一貫的對政府抗戰建國的工作肆意作誣竭無毀的宣傳，其目的就是要離間我政府與國民的關係，分散我中華民國整個的力量。貶損國家的地位，抹煞我全體軍民抗戰的歷史，减低我人民救國的信心，沮喪我人民愛國的意志。他們不僅在學校。在社會，在工廠。在經濟界造謠挑撥擾亂破壞，他們並公開宣稱，這種擾亂破壞行爲則他叛亂的「第二這戰綫」，而以軍叛變爲他第一道戰綫」，兩者互相策應，旣可以軍事影響社會，更可以後方影嚮前綫，這是何等險毒的陰謀，我不能不喚起大家及時防止。我可以向大家申言，政府這次實施總動員·一切必照法定的範圍，對於人民的基本權利，各級軍政機關自必一尊重，但是對於不顯國家危機，不守民簇大養甘愛共匪亂國殃民的指使，參加其「第二戰綫」的工作，而有擾亂秩序，危害治安的行爲，則歡府爲國家存亡與人民禍福計，自不能姑息養奸，必須負責取締，依照法紀，予以處治。當此剿匪軍事積極展開，輪機將士浴血奮鬥的時候，凡我愛國同胞，務必萬衆一心，團結一致，認淸目標，積極努力。乃可以加强軍事力量，縮短戰禍日期，及早達成　平叛亂的目的。</p>
<p>政府對於當前時局的決策，已見於國務會議的決議，這次的總動員，不僅爲剿匪軍事勝利而動員，也爲了求取國家改革與勞力建設而動員，因此，我更要爲我同胞指出下列的兩點。</p>
<p>實行憲政工作　不因剿匪　延</p>
<p>第一，我們要致力完成建國的工作。我們今天當然要集中力量，加强軍事，戡平叛亂，實現統一，而一面亦要努力建設，增進生產，來打破共匪妨礙建國危害民生的陰謀，尤其我們實行憲政與推進民主的工作，決不因剿匪事而稽近。共黨高呼民主而反對憲政，進絕參加國民大會，盡力破壞建國程序的進行，這就可以看出共匪是根本不願中國有憲政，根本不顧中國實行民主，根本不願中國完成生產建設的。如果中國實行了憲政，他就要在憲政之前解除其私有的武裝，喪失他叛國的根據；如果中國走上了民主的大逍，由人民起來作國家的主人，則他們所謂無產階級專政獨裁的恐佈政策，在人民大衆的公意之前，就無法行使其欺騙與壓迫。而且中國一旦實行憲政與民主，完成經濟建設應有的工作，他就　　不能製迭社會的混亂與經濟的恐慌，就無法憑藉人民的飢餓困乏，以遂其建立蘇維埃政權的陰謀。所以我要正吿我全國　　同胞，正吿全國眞正爲民主自由與建立現代國家而努力的同胞，我們要實現民主憲政，完成建國工作，必須剿除這個與民主自由及復興建設根本不能相容的共匪武裝集團，同時正因爲要使中國脫離恐怖主義製造混亂製造飢餓的魔爪，我們更應該急起直追，完成憲政，準備實行民生主義，保障人民的　木權利，改善人民的經濟生活，絕不能絲亳動搖我們一貫的信心，鬆弛我們應有的努力。</p>
<p>一面執行剿匪　一面改革內政</p>
<p>第二，我們要全力促進國家的改革與進步。我們現在一面要執行剿匪戰事，一面就要改革內政，我不諱言政府的本身存在着種種缺點，而我們社會亦存在着許多弱點。經過八年艱苦的抗　，接着就有共匪叛變的禍亂，使政府與社會不邊喘息、治標治本雖於兼顧，國力民力更疲敵，戰後各種缺點弱點，更形顯露，以致人民痛苦日益加深整個民族意志分散。如果政府不能斷行改革，力求進步，我們國家就無法存立於現代的世界。因之，我們政治’經濟。敎育，社會，各方面的改革決不能待剿匪軍事結束。而應該立刻開始實行。我們要從澈底的改革中間，充實國家的力量，解除人民的痛苦，統一政府與人民的意志，以突破國家當前所而對着的國難。我們同胞對於政治經濟的缺點，和民生痛苦的所在，凡有意見的貢獻，政府無不竭誠採納，努力改正。對於各級政府施政上的錯誤，更望指明事例，剴切舉發，俾責切實糾正。我們這次實行總動員，就是要集合政府與人民的力量，一德一心，自反自覺，來刷新政洽的積弊排除一切妨害國家進步的阻力，所以我們總動員的意義，不是消極的而是積極的，不是局部的而是全國的，不是片面的責成人民，而同時也是鞭策我們各級政府和各地社會的進步和建設。中正許身革命，一貫爲挽救國家危亡而奮鬥，爲實行三民主義而奮鬥，爲統一建國與實現民主憲政而奮鬥，個人的成敗得失，毀譽榮辱，都非所計，我所可掬示於我同胞的，祇有救國救民的一片耿耿忠誠。我決不能辜負國父與革命先烈，決不能自背革命救國的初衷，決不能辜負八年抗戰患難與共的軍民同胞。我必竭忠盡智以保持我們抗戰勝利的成果，任何妨害我們主義實現，破壞我們國家統一，阻礙我們國家建設與進步的敵人，我誓必領導我全體同胞，生死不渝，始終一致的奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>掃除建國障碍　完成建國大業</p>
<p>我全國同胞們：臨到今天七七抗戰神聖紀念日，我要求全國同胞重振我們抗戰時期舉國一致，奮勇邁進的精神，而堅定我們對於掃除建國障礙，完成建國大業的信心。我在抗戰勝利時早經宣示我全國同胞：「我們戰後復興建國的任務，比之戰時更要十倍的艱鉅。」以我們中國近百年來遭受內憂外患的深重，以我們國家社會基礎的薄弱，要造成一個富強康樂獨立自由的新中國，本來不是旦夕之間所能期成的事。但是我們國家歷史這樣的悠久，人口這樣的衆多，民族德性這樣的優秀而堅忍，我可以斷言任何頑强的阻力，決不能妨碍我們國家的復興，祇要我們同胞以抗戰期間同樣的決心和忍耐，一致奮起，積極努力，則共匪的叛亂必能於最短期內予以戡平。我們克服了這一個最後困難，掃除了這一個最大障碍之後，國家民族就可進入於光明燦燜的坦途。所以我們同胞切不可爲共匪虛偽的宣傳所迷惑不可因當前局勢的艱難而灰心喪志以動搖其自信。我願同胞們無忘當時「抗戰必勝」的誓願，堅定我們「建國必成」的信念，發揚抗戰勝利的偉績，突破一切的艱難險阻，肅淸共匪，掃除赤禍，以究成建國的大業，而安慰我們爲抗戰與剿匪而犧牲的軍民先烈之靈（完）</p>

<p>今天是七七抗戰紀念日，是我中華民族用血，淚，汗交織而成的一個偉大的紀念日。自從蘆溝橋事變發生以來，迄今正是十個年頭；在過去的八年之中，我們雖艱苦抗戰，受盡了一切的煎熬與磨折，但是全國的人民都認爲，這是我民族生存有關的聖戰，並相信最後勝利必屬於我：所以在過去的八年之中，每逢七月七日，我們終覺得勝利之門，離開我們一天近似一天，我們常流着興奮的汗，家紀念這個偉大的紀念日；並鞭策我們流血流汗去爭取勝利。八個「七七」過去了，我們終於獲得了最後勝利，使過去的八年，在我國近代史上成爲曠古未有而最光榮的一個時代。</p>
<p>去年今日，我們逢着第九次的「七七」，勝利光臨已有十個多月，不僅未見國家走上建國復興的大道，而且眼見得勝利的果實，已開始霍爛，使我們不得不報以辛酸的淚。今年今日，是抗戰勝利後的第二個「七七」，、緬懷過去抗戰的艱苦，先烈們流過壯烈的鮮血，都已流芳萬世了：但是瞻望國家的前途，潛伏着各種可怕的危機，益感我們所負責任的重大，我們如不能完成「建國」的使命，如何能對得起取義成仁的先烈！所以今年此日，我們絕不能再像去年僅報之以淚，而應振作抗戰時期以流汗流血爭取勝利的精神，掃除建國途中所有的障礙，以達成建國的偉業。今天本報同仁，除悼念抗戰陣亡將士及死難同你敢而外，並抒所懷，願與全國同胞自警自惕與共勉。</p>
<p>第一，我國八年抗戰獲得的勝利，是償付了非常重大的代價而取得的：我們決不能聽任勝利之果實霉爛的。在我們中國人的心頭，都有着「惆非常沉痛的回憶，蔗溝橋畔的炮聲一響，日寇的侵略氣燄，便咄咄逼人，使我中華民族不得不作生死的決鬥，「八一三」淞滬之戰，接踵而起，乃導成中日間全面的戰爭，其後平津之役，台兒莊之役，徐州之戰，武漢之戰，長沙之戰，豫鄂之戰，湘桂之戰，綏晋之戰，以及滇緬之戰，北起朔漠，南迄瓊崖，中國全境幾乎沒有不受日寇的蹂躪　，全國軍民作壯烈犧牲者，前仆後繼，何祗千萬人！以千萬人的頭頗換來的勝利；我們怎能不特別加以珍惜。但自勝利光臨迄今，未及兩年，戰勝後所有的美夢都幻減了，而戰敗的日本，反而蠢蠢欲動：日本九十高齡的老議員尾崎行雄，竟也提出荒謬的建議，主張中國東北，台灣，琉球以及朝鮮，至公共秩序恢復之時應舉行公民投票，以決定各該處人民是否希望獨立或願併入何國。僅以此一端而論，也就可以知道戰敗的日本又在那裏企圖翻身了。回頭看看自己中國，在國際會議席上，常常要遭受他國的悔辱與排斥　　，所謂「五强之一」，中國早已有名無實的了：旅順大連的不能接收，外蒙軍隊的侵入我國新疆省境，在在都足以說明，中國又將遭受外來侵略的威脅了，我們如果不奮起圖强，則不僅千萬軍民的血是白流了，而且中國又將爲被侵略者了。所以我們在今年此日，不得不大聲疾呼，提高人民對於國事的警覺；無論如何，我們終得要保存勝利的果實，決不能任其霉爛的。</p>
<p>第二，國內外的局勢，雖然使教們感覺到國家前途的危急：但是也不難從四面楚歌聲中殺出一條血路來。目下當務之亟，首在掃除建國途中所有的障礙。先從遠處看，國際局勢兩年來的演變，竟形成目前兩大壁壘對峙的形勢，是誰也預料不到的。在過去世人對於美蘇關係，終還抱着幾分希望，殊不料至今日，事實竟證明，美蘇合作的可能性，日見渺茫，蘇聯攻擊馬歇爾的援歐計劉，具有分化歐洲的企圖：而英法則認爲蘇聯拒不參加歐州復興計劃，就是使歐洲分化的第一步。照此說來，美蘇的對立日益尖銳化，已至短兵相接的階段；我們早已一再指出，中國是愛好和平的國家，是願意世界「合」而不願意「分」的，世界的分裂，徒然有利於戰敗的國家，美國處在這種情勢之下，必在經濟上，積極援助德國復興，自不待言；美國對於日本，更加要採取扶持日本的政策了。日本的興起，就是中國安全的威脅，所以美國的對日政策，無一不使中國惴惴不安。但是我們若能採取「反求諸己」的態度，自省自惕，則也不能不埋怨自己，爲什麼戰勝的中國，不能精誠團結奮發圖强？反而將國力消耗於國內的戰亂呢？天助自助，美國看到戰敗的日本，一切都能走上軌道，有條不紊自不免要發生偏向日本的心理：但是美國採取這種對日政策，將來終不免引起遠東的浩刦，而首當其衝的，就是我們中國。第三次世界大戰若果爆發，不問其性質如何，如果以中國爲戰塲，終是中國人民的不幸。所以這種國際形勢　醞釀，我們爲中國前途計，同時也爲遠東和平計，是應該設法消除的。我國內在的問題不能解決，自然要减低我們在國際上的地位。我們平心靜氣地想一想，勝利兩年來造成目前的局勢，共產黨豈能辭其咎！昨晚蔣主席向全國廣播，也說明了我們國家的局勢。蔣主席說：『共黨匪軍一年多來的主要行動，無不集中於破壞交通，，破壞工礦，而且到處破壞奄奄一息的農村。政府每一次頒發停戰令，只有一助長共黨更進一步的擴張，也只有使戰後社會復興更加困難，到了現在，我們全國同胞可以明白認識共黨是絕對沒有悔禍的誠意。』我們面對着這種危險的局勢，如果不能舉國一致戡平叛亂，則我中華民國必致被共黨割裂斷送。所以我們紀念七七抗戰十週紀念日，應該恢復抗戰精神加强我們對於建國必成的信念；痛下決心，誓作政府的後盾　　，傳於最短期內掃除建國途中所有的降礙，從而踏上建國的大道！</p>
<p>歸後，我們對於在前終苦鬥的將士，在勝利之後猶未能復員還鄉，仍要在那裏掃除建國途中的障礙，更不能不表示無上的敬意。誠如一蔣主席所說：『後方同胞今天尙得保持其經常的生活方式，全賴我們爲剿匪救民而犧牲的國軍將士在前綫奮鬥：否則早已陷入華北東北共匪區內民衆一樣的悲境了。」這幾句話，最値得我們後方民衆體味與深思的！</p>

<h3>馬歇爾援助計劃　可能擴大至遠東　遠經會中或將提出討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖五日合衆〕聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委員會定十日在此舉行會議，可能非正式討論將馬歇爾援助計劃擴大至遠東，委會之代表亦將豐灣蘇聯抵制該會議之可能。此次會議，將正式命名為全體委員會會議，其目的在完成程序規則，及其他維問題之討論。議程中最接近馬歇爾計劃者。爲討論亞洲及遠東經濟委員會在滬會議時所起　之建議案。此間觀察家稱：馬歇爾計劃，雖為援助歐洲而建議者。但美國在日本，朝鮮及世界其他部份均負有職責，猶憶上海會議時，蘇聯代表史狄辛柯會表示蘇聯或不致派遣代表，出席全體委員會，宣委員會似有忽視蘇聯對軍要問題所淼意見之趨向也。史氏反對設立全體委員會，授以向經濟暨社會理事會直接報吿之權之程序。渠稱：此種決定，使委員會本身之工作，流於裝飾性。又上海會議之主席，中國代表蔣廷　將於八日或九日抵此，就遠東會議提出報吿。</p>
<h3>對英法召開歐洲會議　五國已接受邀請　若干國家須至最後始能決定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎六日電〕頃悉：截至目前爲止，已有五個歐洲國家，即愛爾蘭，葡萄牙，義大利，希臘與荷籣，接受英法請柬，參加巴黎經濟會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎六日電〕由歐洲各國京城半官方之反應而言，英法於七月十二日召開討論馬歇爾計劃之二十四國會議，當有一牟以上可出席。至五日下午截止，雖未接獲對英法請柬之正式答覆，然一般相信被邀請之二十二國中至少有十二三國加以接受，可能包括波蘭與捷克。究有若干國家能出席會議，須於會議開始前一分續才能知悉，荒若干國家在取決如此重要之問題時，必有許多困離也。</p>
<p>歐洲反響一斑</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕被邀參加巴黎會議以討論馬歇爾計劃之歐洲二十二國中，尚有多數國家，猶未決定態度，茲將此等國家對英法邀請之反應，綜述如下：</p>
<p>斯坎的那維亞：哥本哈根權威方面息，斯坎的那諸國外長，將於下星期三或四開會討論英法之邀請，瑞典，挪威，丹麥三國外長業已相互交換意見。據斯德哥爾摩消息，三國外長均已表示贊成接受邀請。奧地利：維也納可靠方面謂雖有共產黨之反對，奧國仍可望接受邀請，奧內閣下週三之會議或將提早舉行，討論奧政府致英法之覆文。捷克斯拉夫之捷克重要代表團將於日內赴莫斯科與蘇聯討論經濟事務，該代表國可能由總理戈特華特或外長之。土耳其：伊斯坦埠來電謂，土耳其駐法大使將代表土國參加巴黎會議。希臘：雅典消息謂希臘接受英法邀請之覆文可望於星期日提出。匈牙利：匈情報部長密哈爾　今日表示匈牙利之答覆，須俟狄奈總理於週二銷假視事後始能決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：南斯拉夫當局預料，其政府將拒絕參加巴黎之美國援歐計劃會議，據稱該國政府之態度，將取決於蘇聨之態度云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社阿爾巴尼亞京城六日電〕阿爾巴尼亞「巴斯基米報」今日挾繫巴黎會議，略謂：「該會將敎訓帝國主義者，即彼等不能以美元購費歐洲各國之自由與獨立」。</p>
<h3>義外長接見蘇使</h3>
<p>〔法國新開社羅馬六日電〕義大利外交部史福柴今日接見蘇聯駐義大使袔斯蒂洛夫，有所會談。據政界人士談稱：談話內容當係關於義大利接受英法邀請參加巴黎經濟會議以及蘇聯遲遲未將對義和約批准等事。</p>
<h3>法外部將公佈　外長會議文件</h3>
<p>莫洛托夫電謝皮杜爾</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕頃悉法國外交部即將以黃皮書發表最近巴黎三國外長會議之各種文件，此在英國外務部則並未準備採取同樣之步驟。此外又悉：法國外長皮杜衛，業已接獲蘇聯外長莫洛托夫於本月三日發出之電報，內稱：蘇聯代表在巴黎時承熱誠招待，今匆匆離法返國，謹向閣下表示感謝之意云。</p>
<h3>賴依返國度假</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐的五日電〕聯合國秘書長賴依在啓程返挪威渡假前，發表談話，否認美國之援歐計劃，超越聯合國職權之說。賴氏並日，在巴黎之一切發展，已由英駐聯合國機構代表賈德幹給予詳細報吿。</p>
<h3>英法對西　態度不變</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕此間權威方面稱：弗朗哥於西理牙舉行公民投票決定繼承法之前夕，向國民發表之廣播，雖聲言西班牙已在立法及社會工作方面，完成更英法未邀四班牙參加巴黎會議之決議。英法之忽略西班牙，祇因英法認西班牙政府並非民主政府而聯合國機構亦未準備在目前環境下與西班牙合作。弗朗哥之演說並未能改變英法之此等意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社屬德里五日合衆電〕官方消息，西班牙將向英外務部提出强硬抗議，反對西班牙不得參加馬卿計劃之商談。</p>
<h3>社經會將討論　合作聨盟案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖五日電〕聯合國經濟於會理事會定於本月十九日在此開會，　定討論國際合作聯盟之提案，即由聯合國織稱設立一機關，在關係國家許可之範圍內，管理中東之油源。英美方面人士則以為聯合國機稱不能有效的管理中東油源，困而表示反對。</p>
<h3>法政局仍不穏</h3>
<p>擁護政府者可能合裂</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕關於合國民大會通過信任　塲迪內閣案，此問政界人士對此，甚爲滿意，社會黨全國執行委員會本日開會討論政府所採取之經濟政策，明日將舉行投票表決。預料賴　通總理不能獲得多數擁護。按在法國共產黨退出政府時，賴瑪迪內閣僅得二千五百二十九對二千一百二十五票多數之擁護。但至此際，賴瑪迪總理雖已克服若干障礙，但仍不能高枕無憂，良以擁讓政府之多數，仍有分裂之盧故也。</p>
<h3>貝文外相警告蘇聨　英美各界深為震動</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕關於英外相貝文昨晚於美國國慶日所發表之演說，頃據此間接獲紐約消息，此項演說在美國所引起之刺激，以視其在英國所引起者尤甚。貝文外相警蘇聯領袖勿過於激怒英國，致使其忍無可忍。英人因蘇聯拒不與他國合作，而表示憤懣者亦大有人在。凡此雖均値得注意，但此並非英國人民或其負責人士均普遍懷有此種情緒之謂，反之英國重要人士均希望蘇聯之拒絕並非最後性質，無論如何，巴黎三國外長之失敗決不應被目爲西歐與東歐間獲致諒解之「最後機會」業已消失。貝文外相之演說亦有若千點頗爲重要，如其表示願與蘇聯合作等。</p>
<h3>艾登發表演說　擁護貝文外交</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦五日電〕前外相艾登五日在此間發表演說，擁護貝文之行動，即不顧蘇聯之拒絕合作，而準備進行馬歇爾之計劃。艾登之演辭有謂：「吾國執政者之任務甚爲明顯，彼等必須與吾人之法國朋友及其他願意參加之國家共同策劃，以響應馬歇爾歷史性之貢獻使之迅速實現，尤爲重要，蓋歐洲經濟已極端嚴重，決不容再有猶豫也。吾人希望若干東歐小國，其需要經濟援助不亞於吾人者，能不顧蘇聯之不願，而來參加此一計劃。」艾登並雖擁護政府之外交政策，然嚴詞譴責國內之經濟計劃。渠警吿稱：「若英國照目前之速率，繼續揮霍美國借款，則在本午聖誕節之前吾人之美全信用即將涸竭，吾人將以自己之金錢資源來補充，而照目前之支出，則亦不能再支特一年也。」</p>
<h3>美駐波大使履新</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華沙五日電〕美新任駐滬戲大使格利芬斯，前來履新，本日抵此。</p>
<h3>杜魯門籲請人民　績援救國外糧荒</h3>
<p>〔路透　華盛頓六日電）杜魯門總統昨日發表，至一九四七年六月三十日為止美國接濟國外糧食八百五十萬噸之報千者書時，並警吿美國謂，世界尙有數千百萬之人民，處於極度飢僅狀態之下，美國當盡其力量，繼續减輕人類之痛苦，協助他國從事自助。總統力　美國云年收成之佳，雖超過歷史上之紀錄，但美國亦勿應忽視即使由美國及其他糧食輸出國盡最大努力，亦不能應付戰後世界之糧食緊急需要。北歐去冬之酷寒影響糧食之收成，故在今後數月內，美國仍須以大量糧食出口。</p>
<h3>匈牙利九月普選</h3>
<p>〔路透社布　斯五日電〕今日添露勾牙利之普選，將於九月舉行，新選舉法本月杪即可向國會提出，預料識員人數將有增加。</p>
<h3>美國上空　發現「飛盤」　究係何物眾說紛紜</h3>
<p>〔聯合社奧　罔州波德蘭六日電〕昨據三十三個州各地相繼報吿天空發現速率甚大之盤狀物件後，全國人民迷惑失揩，美軍飛機多架携帶攝影配備，今日準備出動搜索。B-30機一架，現在加里福尼亞慕洛克陸軍航空站候命待發，P-51型機六架則在此問集含　企圖偵察此等神秘飛盤究屬何物。科學家與軍人均承認無法解釋該一現象。陸海軍方面宣稱，並非軍事試驗用機：原子能委員會主席李　泰爾力言其與委員會實騐工作無關。芝加哥天文學家二人　飛盤或出「人造」。芝加哥大學葉克氣象台主任寇伯認爲決非殞星。西北大學第爾滂學院院長李氏聲稱：「吾人現已確知陸海軍正在研究各種世間所無之事物。飛盤與向月球發出雷信號者屬於同一性質，乃本年度最大技術成就之一，其裝造經過絕對保守秘密。」又據「洛杉磯觀察家」報引某料學家談稱：「此等飛盤恐係原子能變形實驗之結果。速率甚大，但可自地面操縱，半徑二十尺，起飛時一部份由火箭推進。」此外芝加哥大學原子科學家烏利獨抱相反見解，斥其為妄。上月二十五晶最初報告發現飛盤時，一般人士嗤之以鼻，但迄今報告者計達數百人，其中多數且係有訓練之飛行員，此事益可憑信。本月四日，愛達和州民衆一批二百人，另一批六十人，均會親眼目擊東部各州亦有類似報告。但對飛盤之若干特徵如大小·速率·亮度·圓形抑　圓形·飛行姿態之奇異波動性等，衆說紛紜，莫衷一是。</p>
<h3>文化經濟協定簽字　波捷關係益增進　捷訪蘇代表團人選決定</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格五日電〕普拉格與華沙今日同時發表公報，報吿波籣代表團赴捷京談判，以謀加强兩國關係之結果。波蘭代表團係由總理薛倫茲維資親自率領，於星期日抵達普拉格。公報於報吿兩　業已簽訂文化及經濟協定後，並日雙方均認有盤遠實行此項協定之必要。</p>
<p>兩國代表除談判實施前項協定之細則外，僅決定在最短期內實施三月十日在華沙所　捷波盟約附則內之規定，即應使　境之捷克及斯拉夫人及捷境之波蘭人，得享受國民之政治文化經濟發展全權。公報復宣稱，雙方復議定不久即在捷克之奧斯特拉伐，設立波蘭領事署，在波蘭之卡托維斯，設立捷克領事署。公報最後並日，兩國代表就關於國際局勢之各項問題，尤其是德國問題交換意見後，已知兩國政府之立塲實完全一致。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社捷京五日電〕捷克基督敎人民黨機關報本日報稱，行將前往莫斯科與蘇聯締結商務協定之捷克代表團，因巴黎三外長會議失敗後政局改觀，故其人選已有所更動。現將由內閣總理哥特華爾特及外長馬薩里克率領，對外貿易部長里浦加亦爲代表之一。捷古代表團在莫斯科時，將與蘇聯代表討論政治問題。至於捷克代表團之目標及其留在莫斯科時問之久暫，官方對此均迄未發表聲明。但據觀察家稱，捷克代表團所當與蘇聯當局討論主要問題之一，將爲英法兩國邀請捷克參加歐洲經濟會議一事，捷克亟需美國之援助，此一問題可能在莫斯科獲得澈底解決。</p>
<h3>日工人大遊行　擁護現政府</h3>
<p>促履行社會黨政綱</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京六日電〕全日本工會協會會員二萬餘人，六日晨在皇宮廣塲遊行，以支持片山之社會主義政府，此爲日本被佔領來第一次支持政府之勞工遊行。</p>
<p>〔新亞社實京六日電〕以社會黨爲中心之片山內閣執政後，在與保守勢力妥協下，其在野時向日本國民提出之政綱多項未付實施，日本國民感感不滿。東京工人團體遂於六日正午召開社會黨激勵大會，參加工人達三萬人，一致責備社會黨之政策軟弱，並要求該黨實現其在野時之政鋼。大會決議向片　　　提出下列三項意見：（一）政府制定之產業別工資，對工資發生凍結作用故表示反對。（二保體生活必需品之配給及國民最低生活。（三）即時廢止勞動所得稅。此決議案當塲交萬出席該會之社會黨代表西尾，西尾當即表示社會黨在野時政　，當漸次付之實施，該會於當日午後二時散會。</p>
<h3>美報人應邀　將赴日考察</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕地間報紙發行人與編輯等一行，應陸軍部之邀，定於八日啓程前赴日本考察美軍佔領工作，名單與行程未悉。</p>
<h3>西班牙王位繼承法　昨舉行公民複決　讠法一經通過內閣即將改組</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬德里五日電〕西班牙於五日舉行公民複決投票，弗期哥之「繼承法」當可以絕大多數通過。據傳政府獲此「信任票」後，內閣即將改組。弗朗哥擬任命總理一人，俾官已可以專任元首職務。今日之公民投票，在西班牙爲十一年來第一次。預料所得結果，贊成者可達百分之七十五至八十五，素植者百分之十五，反對者不過百分之十。據半官方面預測，合格選民一六·一八七·〇九二人，百分之六十均將投票。反弗朗哥派已奉命不投票，或祗投空白票，領導者為復辟派。全國勞工聯合會及總經會，因無言論，出版，集會自由，祇能從事秘密遝動，其反對之效力須俟七月廿六日全國投票結果發表時方能明瞭。公民複決之惟一問題爲繼承法，此法規定弗期哥為國家元首，西班牙爲一「王國」，弗朗哥自動退職或死亡時，將由王或攝政繼之執掌政務，此法已由弗朗哥用命令公布，並經議會通過。</p>
<h3>澳反對從容日本　伊我特外長將晤麥帥舉行商　美懼英在對日和會行使否決權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雪香六日電〕澳外長伊伐特在下星期中與麥帥會晤時，渠將提出强　之抗議，反對「一人管治」日本。澳政府報紙及人民似已一致反對美國官方認為日本佔領政策之適當反對日本捕鯨及開掘磷礦之抗議，足以反映澳洲之不滿。澳洲各權成報紙關於此事之訾議，乃歷年來最爲激烈者之反美言論。麥伊會議諒可改善美澳間之不良關係，一般認爲該會議雖爲」私人性質」而非「政治性質」，但伊伐特將以友誼立塲，提出澳洲不滿之概要。澳洲觀察家認爲此次會議殊屬重要，藎在此次會議之後，英蒂國會議將於八月中在澳洲召開，以制定英帝國關於對日和約之方針。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕據悉，對蘇聯在聯合國中「濫用』否決權極表痛心之美官員，激烈反對美國在未來日本和會中放棄其否決權。彼等竭力主張美國保持否決特權者，蓋恐英聯合王國擁有多數會員國在對日和會實際上等於使用有效之否決權。在對日和會中應否使用否決權之異見，已成爲美國與英帝國之基本衝突。今年冬季或明春殆爲召開日本和會最可能之時間，美方官員並不認爲對日和約應由草擬歐洲和約之外長會議制定之。國務部希望由目前遠東委員會之會員國擬定。決議之產生將採取三分二之多數制，換言之，任何問題須有八票變成票始能成立，但如有四票反對票，任何決議即不能成立。因此，美國官　認爲英帝國在致行動下，即等於使用否決權，蓋英國加拿大澳洲紐西籣皆將出席對日和會也。且印度與荷蘭素以擁　英國遠東政策著稱，亦爲出席對日和會之國家，而澳外長伊伐特又反對否決權最力。</p>
<p>英聯合王國將於八月廿二日在康白拉召開會議，討論對日和約之政策，美官員深恐此一會議將擬定方針，使英國可絕對控制對日和約并有權阻止英國所必欲之任何決議。</p>
<h3>國際關稅談判　六組成立協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦六日電〕國際貿易機構籌備委員頃發表報吿，添露已有南非與智利·中國與南非·南非與古巴·及智利與挪威等四組國家完成關稅談判，此外加拿大與挪威·南非與捷克亦均已成立協議，故在總數九十組中，已有六組完成關稅談判。地毯書並聲明業已成立之協議，得視其他談判而予以修正。</p>
<h3>印臨時政府辭職　西北邊省舉行公民投票　邁斯基將任蘇駐印大使</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里五日電〕印度臨時政府副總統尼赫爾及其閣員，已向印督蒙巴頓提出辭呈，政界人士認臨時政府之辭職，乃印度獨立法案向英國下議院提出後的之當然結果。印督今當重組印度政府，使其符合分洽計劃之規定。西</p>
<p>西北邊省將於星期日舉行公民投票，以決定該省之將屬巴基斯坦抑印度斯坦。該省省長陸克哈特宣布在投票之十一日內，全省將被視爲「動亂區域」，有企圖殺人擄人或非法捕人者得處死刑。聞該省之國大黨省內閣並不贊成參加巴蘇斯坦或印度斯坦，而主張設立獨立之巴泰尼斯坦國。</p>
<p>〔路透透倫數六日電〕「人民報」稱：前任蘇聯駐印度之首任大使。該報並謂，眞納之巴基斯坦力圖與阿富汗樹立更密切之關係，故尼赫魯不久將親自赴莫斯科，防止巴基斯坦與阿富汗之携手，亦所以防止彼等之與中東阿拉伯國家結成大規模之回教國集團。</p>
<h3>中國繪畫展覽　在日內瓦揭幕</h3>
<p>「中央社日內瓦五日專電」此間中國圖書館館長胡天石博士所主辦之中國繪實展覽會，今日午後在此間著名博物館內舉行。參加度覽之作品，計選一百七十幅，其中七十幅爲前北平國立囈專及中央大學敎授吳作人之作品，此外尚有我國優秀男女畫家之傑作多幅，及我教育部收集之作品五十幅。會中陳陳列此間中國圖警館收藏之宋代以下我國之古典及現代作品卅上　，展覽會將晨覽一月。</p>
<h3>日紀念「黑船節」　艾其森談對日政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社日本下田五日電」美國海軍副少將潘萊，九十四年前曾率艦行促令日本與外國通商，日人自一九三〇年起舉行「黑船」節以誌紀念，戰時停止舉行，今日方始恢復。</p>
<p>〔路透社東京六日電〕盟管會主席艾其森於美國潘萊艦長於一八五四年初次登陸日本紀念日之今日，發表談話，聲言戰後美國對日政策主要目標之一，在建立和平而負責之日本。潘萊抵日後未及兩代，日本已開始採用西方文明及進代戰爭之利器，故今日業已痛惡　武主義之日本人民，採用適於其對內需要及對外責任之民主政治，當亦不足爲怪。美國在種種困難之下，已盡其所能，以糧食救濟日本人民，美國願使日本早日得以自給，決不奪取日本和平經濟及造成其對外負責地位所需之一切。</p>
<h3>耶爾納將軍談　美國防要素</h3>
<p>〔合衆社印地安納州寇佛城六日電〕現已退休之前美亞洲艦隊司令耶納爾海軍上將，六日在主持寇佛軍校之署期海軍學校開學禮時發表演說稱：普遍軍訓「可能爲有用的」，但此非美國準備之最重要因素。法國亦曾實施強迫軍訓，但仍遭崩潰，蓋法國乃一政治分裂之國家，其軍隊缺乏團結，道德及效率。美國準備之要素，應包括全力發展吾人之經濟及財政力量，開發吾人之資源，及發展吾國人之道德與體格。</p>
<h3>美國基本政策剖視</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>美國的藝本政策是維護本國的安全，增進其福祉，並在可能的範團內協助世界上其他國家。美國同時採取兩種補助的政第，以便達成這些目的，那兩種政策是：（一）儘速並充分加强聯合國機構；（二）保證美國確能自衛，並給予一切友邦以可能的支援。</p>
<p>美國在今後若干年中不能憑藉聯合國以維護它的安全，已爲世人所公認；同時蘇聯控制下的各國和英美領導下的西方列强間利害利政策的衝突，實爲世界和平的一個穏憂：這也是很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>美國在大戰刦餘的世界各國中是一個最幸運的國家，因此各方紛紛請求它担任國際義務，其範圍之廣大顯然非美國所能獨立担承的。就美國的實際能力而論，凡是値得考慮的請求應看它們是否具備戰略的，經濟的，或人道主義的三種理由之一。凡基於戰路的理由的義務，和美國本身的久安長治問題有題。　如果這種安全關係不很密切，那麼須檢討那些義務對於美國的經濟利益會有什麼影嚮。至於人道主義的義務或許是不可逃避的，而且數量比較的大。但是查考這類義務對於美國安全和利益的關係，它們的地位要次於嚴略的義務及與安全有關的經濟的義務。人道主義的最大貢獻便是避免又一次的世界大戰。</p>
<p>為考查備國請求美國援助的緩急及其範圍起見，可把全世界分成五個區域來考慮，那五個區域便是：（一）中東·（二）中歐·（三）西歐·（四）遠東·（五）南美。</p>
<p>中東</p>
<p>中東（包括地中海東部）是美國政策目前積極關心的一個區域，事實表規於對希土的援助。這是由於蘇聨和美國最近已成爲兩個敵對世界的領袖，英國無力維持其在該區域內的支配地位，以及該區域內大量油藏的重要性日益增大。</p>
<p>美國對於中東的直接關係雖是比較新近發生的，但這關係是十分重要的。未來世界的安全和進步擊於蘇聯和西方集團的最後合作。在此種合作實現以前，並爲帮助此種合作的成功起見，美國的政策要把蘇聯系統包含於其目前的範圍以內。美國必須領導這一種義務，已爲世人所公認。中東和中歐是行使這領導權的兩惆極重要的區域。</p>
<p>土耳其是中東的拱心石，希蠟是拱柱。如果希蠟落入蘇聯的控制中，土耳其終必隨之，那時回敎世界便被共產主義侵入中東的油藏將被蘇聯所榨取，西方國家將無份享受。蘇聯集團不但將獲得更廣大的區域，豐富的資源和優良的戰略地位，而且對於共產主議的傳播增加了威信和力量。</p>
<p>講到美國在中東區應盡義務的範圍，有人以爲要防止將來費用的增漲，最好是在目前充分投資，藉使帝土成爲防止蘇聯勢力擴張的中東的堡壘。美國援助希土的結果如何以及將來牽涉的範圍若何，雖不可逆料，但是與其日後搶救水災，不如現在把堤岸加强起來，防患於未然來得安全而省錢。</p>
<p>中歐</p>
<p>中歐（指德·奧和特港血言）的地位與中東同樣重要，但是這兩個區域的局勢却完然不相同的。第一，中歐問題尙在談判進行中，大戰的善後東宜還沒有辦理完舉。第二，中歐不但在政治或軍事上發生問題，同樣也發生經濟的問題。第三，蘇聯和西方列強的軍隊各佔一區，互相對峙着。</p>
<p>在中東方面所担任的義務是比較新的，可是在中歐方面的義務是最早已存在的，是不可逃避的。唯一的問題是怎樣以最適當的方法云應付中歐局勢，使之減少到可以支持的程度。主要的原因是由於軍事佔領和美國長期經濟援助的絕對必要，比較間接的原因是反共政策的推行。這一項業務須賡續至數年之久。</p>
<p>西歐</p>
<p>西歐是需要美國經濟援助的第三個區域所負擔義務的範圍如何，要看美國解決中歐問題的成績如何而定。中歐方面的發展情形越是不利，那麼美國在西歐方面所負的義務越是重大。</p>
<p>不過美國重建西歐經濟的代價，和美國反對蘇聯集團擴張的政策、兩者的關係不應看得太密切。美國對西歐，尤其是對英法兩國的經濟援助，也可以認爲是美國未來經濟利的一種投資，將來有收回的希望。在另一方面，我們承認政治的不安和經濟的困撻，適足為共產主義活動的根據地，美國為預防或克服這些不安姿態的任何措施，實際上是打擊着共產主義。</p>
<p>遠東</p>
<p>關於美國對外援助必須加以考核的第四個區域，便是中國和遠東。這裏的問題在性質上和範圍上，都和中東及中歐的問題不同。中國和朝鮮固然都和功聯區域接壤，但是和蘇聯活動的中心距離較遠，而且歷史明示我們。中國的版圖太太，民族性太富彈力，是不容易征服，同化，或支配的。　　　從美國人觀點說，遠東的戰略問題，已經隨着日本的戰敗而大為變動了。遠東不再是受着高度政治壓力的區域，它的困難一部分是爲了沒有一個强國存在那裏。</p>
<p>共產主義在東北，無北和朝鮮的傳播，對於美國政策不免是一大阻力，同時對於聯合國機構和美國在該區域的經濟政治利益，都有重犬的影響。不過，只要美國在中太平洋和菲律濱網續保持其戰略地位，那麼，共產主義即使在那蠶域裏蔓延開來，也不至於會直接威脅西方國家，像蘇聯侵入中艾或歐洲所能引起的結果那樣。　　　所以，關於因美國反對共產主義擴張而發生的義務問題，就戰略觀點而論，遠東的地位是顯然在中東和歐洲以下的，該區域對美國援助的要求一定是很大的，但就全體而論，不能享受優先權的，事實上遠東確是美國在必要時可以限制其義務的一個區域。</p>
<p>南美</p>
<p>南美是考慮美國未來義務的第五個重要區域。這里的情形也和其他數區域大不相同。主要的不同點是南美在地理上距離蘇聯較遠，與美國發生政治上，地理上和經濟上的聯繫，以及南美並未受戰爭的蹂躪，沒有救濟和復與等故嚴重問題。</p>
<p>南美，特別是北部的一半區域，對於美國具有戰略和軍事經濟的極大重要性。因此美國在南美方面的義務，該是很廣大的，但美洲人具有利害相共休戚相關的感覺，大多數美國人覺得南美除了和西方國家站在同一陣綫，外，不會跑到別條路綫去的。</p>
<p>怕以現實的看法，南美對於美國雖然關係重大，美國在該區域的義務在必要時可能加以根本限制。（譯自「世界報吿　週刋）</p>

<h3>黃浦江上空前盛典　軍民熱烈興奮　接收日本償艦　日船員閉目垂首無限感慨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國　收日本賠償軍艦第一批「　風」號等八艘之升旗典禮，昨日上午九時在高昌廟海軍江南造船所內舉行，儀式莊嚴隆重，軍民興奮熱烈，誠爲歷史上空前光榮之一頁。</p>
<p>上午八時起，海軍官兵及各界來　即隆續到塲，有海軍第一基地司令方瑩，海軍總司令部接艦處處長楊道釗，駐日代表團海軍少校參謀鍾漢波·美海軍上尉高沙，市黨部主任委員方治，吳市長代表張彼德，師管區司令傅正謨，江南造船所所長馬德驥，各報社記者，中央電影塲攝影人員，海軍大佐，海軍眷屬等共數百人。「雪風」號艦靠岸停泊於江南造船所第一第二號船塢之問，其餘七艦則散處江心。司令臺設於岸上正對「雪風」艦距離約五十公尺之處，週圍滿級五彩繽紛之海軍通話旗，台前以國旗兩面分懸左右，台左高懸白布橫額，上書「接收賠償軍艦升旗典禮」。自司令台至「雪風」艦舖鋼板浮筒，兩旁及登艦之踏脚扶手兩側亦遍懸各色通話旗。迎風飄舞，蔚爲壯觀。</p>
<p>九時時正，典禮開始，全體參加人員分別就位。自司令台起，第一列爲來賓，依次爲海軍官佐，海軍士兵，儀仗隊及軍樂隊。駕駛艦隻來滬之日船員領班緒方（前誤爲岡田）與船山兩人，則立於司令台右側，閉目垂頭，似有無限感慨。其餘日籍船員均留處於艦上。</p>

<h3>並不因獲得賠償而誇耀　但足證明正義必能伸張　——主席方司令致詞——</h3>
<p>九時五分奏樂，肅立奏國歌後，主席方瑩司令以亢奮之聲調，在麥克風前致詞。方氏指出人類文明的藝礎，在和平互助，過去日本少數軍閥不顧公理正義，抱侵略野心，因而引起二次大戰，但大多數日本人民均愛好和平。現軍閥已經打倒，日本人民正向和平民主之道邁進。此次貽價盟國軍艦共計九十二艘，分爲三批，第一批三十二艘分四組，由中美英蘇抽籤，我國抽得第三組，共一萬零四十噸。第二批八艘，兩星期後即可抵滬，第三批七艘再隔兩星期亦可駛來。今日舉野心者，結果必得不償失，自食其果。一爲人類必須實行互助，才能避免戰爭，確保永久和平。吾人令日獲得賠償軍艦，並不以戰利品而誇耀，但此一事實，足爲正義必能伸張的確蹬。最後對於此次盟車麥克阿瑟總部與我駐日代表團之密切合作，及日本海員誠懇駕駛賠價鑑來滬，方司令表示欽佩感謝之意。</p>
<h3>樂聲修揚　國旗上升</h3>
<p>九時一刻，司儀高呼「下日本旗—」官兵來賓乃轉向對「雪風」艦而立，全體屛息無聲，數百對目光齊集於艦頂之太陽旗，視此日本帝國主義之象徵，頹然下降，數百人心底之歡愉，畢露於眉宇之間。繼而藍紅投降旗亦取下。九時二十分，司令台上又高呼「升國旗」，在悠揚之樂聲及全體官兵來賓之敬禮中，我靑天白日滿地紅之國旗徐徐上升，飄揚於碧空之下，似益見其莊嚴美麗。</p>
<p>升旗禮畢，日船員緒方等呈上接收書，此項接收書在日本時已由我方代表簽字，現再由方瑩司令正式簽署以完成手續。繼即請市黨部方主委及吳市長代表張彼德演說，均對此次典禮深感光榮，認爲是日本軍閥侵略主義的下塲，中國人民愛好正義和平的收穫，並希望加强海軍建設，對目前世界尙有抱侵略野心及破壞和平的國家提高警惕。最後鳴砲奏樂禮成。</p>
<h3>參觀雪風艦</h3>
<p>九時四十分典禮完畢後，記者步登「雪風」艦參觀，該艦爲八譽中最大之一艘驅逐艦，重二千四百九十噸，惟所有武裝配備均已　如，　上什物均有零亂破舊之感，艦尾輸送魚雷之鐵軌亦已斑斑生銹。重加配與裝修須費相當時日。據接艦處楊處長談；各艦之新命名尚未決定，暫時依其噸位大小以「接一號」至「接八號」爲區別，供各地接收之海軍器材運來，裝配完成後，再正式定名並發表艦長人選云。</p>
<p>又護送八艦駛滬之「若鷹」號艦，已於接收典禮完畢後，在上午十一時載全體日船員啓駛返日。我聯絡官鍾漢波少校與美海軍高沙上尉亦仍隨艦赴日，進備押送第二批軍艦來滬。</p>

<h3>端木愷筆師播講　法筆眼光看現政府　此次改組以後可更走近民主一步</h3>
<p>〔本报訊〕本報昨日假座中國電台，舉辦第十四次星期日特別廣播，請名律師端木愷播講：「以法律的眼光來看現政府」，茲赫其演詞如下：</p>
<p>最近政府經過一次改組，這次改組的特點有二：（一）除了原有的國民黨而外，又參加了民社黨和靑年黨，在國府委員會方面，有民靑兩黨的國府委員，在行政院方面有民靑兩然的政務委員，幷有青年黨兩人担任部長。立法院方面有民靑兩黨的立法委員，雖然司法·監察·考試三院尙無兩黨人士參加，但幷不影響此次改組政府的意義。（二）此次改組政府係實行責任內閣制，行政院直接對國府委員會負責，此種制度，在歐美政治史上不乏先例，惟亦有不盡相同之處，如英國在戰時曾出現過各黨派聯合內閣，但須經國會通過，法國因小黨立，幾無一黨可以單獨組織內閣者，每次內閣均為條黨組成，亦須經國會同意。至於美國在戰時雖延攬共和黨人士入閣，但僅對羅斯福總統個人負責，至於政府方面則由民主黨一黨對國會負責。以　我國行政院以國府委員會負責者捎有不同。</p>
<p>革命分成三個階段</p>
<p>中國國民黨自北伐以來，即實行一黨專政，以迄規在改組爲止，吾人研究其一黨專政之原因，其根據有三：（一）理論上的根據，中國國民黨係創造民國之政黨，其惟一目的在造成民主國家，惟民主國家人民，須在生活習慣上，政治修養上，有運用民主的技能與智識，初由專制政體下解放之人民，實無此素養，故總理孫先生將革命分成一階段：A軍政時期，B訓政時期，C憲政時期。首用軍事補蕩革命前途的障礙，嗣於訓政時期頒訂約法，以訓練人民對民主有深切的認識，然後進入憲政時期，始克有效，故一黨訓政爲革命必經之階段。</p>
<p>事實敎訓法律根據</p>
<p>（二）事實上的根據，國民黨於民國建立以後，曾將政權讓於袁世凱，其間經過袁氏稱帝，官統復辟，國會解散，軍閥割據，經歷了無數的痛苦。十五年北伐以後，憬然覺悟政權不能隨便交出，使反動者得乘機消減革命運動，故一黨專政，不稍放鬆，此實爲一事實上之敎訓。（三）法律上的根據，查約法第三十條，「訓政時期由中國國民黨全國代表大會代表國民大會行使中央統治權」，故國民政府之統治權係約法所賦興，不可變更，除憲政完成，憲法公佈施行，約法當然賡止；或國民會議重行修改約法外，其他均無方法改變，此乃一黨專政法律上的根據。</p>
<p>三黨組府如何解釋</p>
<p>國民黨旣實行一黨專政，如何又於黨政實施之前成立三黨聯合政府，應如何解擇呢？第一，國民黨雖一黨專政，但在用人方面是惟才與能，過去不獨事務官，就是政務官中也有不少的非黨員參加政府工作。國民黨旣受人民的託付，組織政府，則此次民靑兩黨之參加政府，旣爲國民黨所同意，也必爲人民所同意。第二，黨派雖有兩個以上，但必有一黨居領導地位，就是西洋的多黨內閣，也只能有一個內閣總理，其中必有一黨負更多的責任，中國現在的政府仍由國民黨居領領導地位，幷負更多的責任，此點對於約法方面并無還礙之處。</p>
<p>內外耳目為之一新</p>
<p>此次政府改組，吾人之印象，可概括言之，更走近民主一步。以國民政府之沿革而言，初成立時可名之爲一權制，立法·行政·司法·監察·考試五權均由國府主席一人直接行使，十七年五院分立，然此係分職，而非分權。廿一年九一八以後。五院直接對國民黨中央黨部負責，此為由分職到分權，其間變化皆逐漸走向民主，惟一黨專政，某苦心孤詣終難爲人民所諒解，於是有此次政府改組之新的措施。此次改組可能發生之影嚮有三：（一）表示國民黨願意開放政權，（二）任何黨派只要是合法活勸，均為政府所允許，（三）政治係實際經騐，國民黨專政十餘年，使其他政黨人士無從事政治的機會，此次改糾政府，使國民黨以外人士有銀鍊實際政治的機會。故經過此次政府改組，國內外耳目一新，吾人對其評價曰：「更走近民主一步」。</p>

<p>（答）（一）（甲）　郵票經郵局宣佈廢止者，「自廢止之日起，在六個月內，得向郵政機關換取新票」，（郵政法第十條）除此之外，郵票一經售出，爲防止弊端起見，槪不出價收回或更換，此係根據郵政親則第一三六條之規定。（乙）臺端所講大額郵票，如無命令廢止，自可永久通用。</p>
<p>（二）（甲）南洋地域遼闊，與滬地距離各有達近，郵運所需時間，亦各不同。例如寄荷屬印度巴城或泗水，航郵約需十天，水陸路約需三星期；如寄星嘉坡或檳榔嶼，航郵祗需五六天，水陸路約需十六天。未悉所稱南洋究指何地？（乙）郵局招考，向例登報公吿，資格亦於公吿中說明。最近期內，不致舉行考試。（丙）平凉路係十九區，武昌路在乍浦路以東係五區，以西爲〇區。</p>

<h3>余上沅將不參加　戲劇專家會議　聞係赴會旅費成間題</h3>
<p>聯合國文敎組織秘書長赫胥黎氏，前曾分函我國敎育部長及余上沅，邀請余氏以專家資格，參加該組織所辦之「戲劇專家會議」。該會議係定於本月廿八日起在巴黎舉行，其主要任務在商討協助受法西斯蹂躪國家之戲劇復興與發展，曁籌備成立「國際戲劇學會」。余氏當即依照該方指示，函徵我國戲劇家主要人士意見，並在報端披露該方寄來之文件，經蒐集後，已於六月十九日將「建議書」寄出，以便列入議程。該建議書要點爲希望能在中國設置「國際戲劇學會遠東分會」，並在南京等地捐建實騐劇塲及戲劇圖書館與博物館。茲悉，關於余氏赴會費用，該方僅担負赴法單程旅費及會期間生活費之半數估計約五百美元，據調査此行約需三千矣元（董守義氏赴歐參加奧林匹克會議，由我國政府補助此數）。頃聞敎育部僅能補助余氏一千美元，其差額爲一千五百美元，較諸實際需要，適爲一倍，故事實上不能成行。</p>
<h3>平市下學期學費增加　失學學生將劇增　私立大學學生紛作停學就業計</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕平市大中小學學生，因下學期學費增加，失學者將劇增。現各私立學校學費雖尙未定，估計大學將在五六十萬元，中學亦在三十至五十萬元間，小學將在三十萬元。因此，各市立或國立學校開始招生報名後，報名者之擁擠爲前所未有。各市立中學平均所招新生，每校將不出二百人，而報名者則達五六千人，雖大雨竟日，報名者亦不稍减，一日之報名者已逾往年之全數。投考市立初中二年級者，不惜退後一年投考一年級。報名證件上，不乏蓋有四五學校「騐訖」圖章者，蓋據讀私立學校之中學生言，通同學雜宿食等費，下學期將不下二百萬元。大部學校且必須開學前一次繳完。此當非普通家庭所能負祖。每一市立中小學校校長所積壓之請託函件，皆甚可觀。私立大學生預想未來之艱難，若干人紛作停學就業計，但因失業者太多，就業亦非易事。二三四年級學生準備從新投老國立大學一年級者，亦不乏人。家在共區，斷絕接濟者，情形尤嚴蔓。平市敎育局，原計劃下學期增加學校，增加班次，但因經費困難，殆皆不能實現。</p>

<h3>洛陽唯一的最高學府　焦作工學院</h3>
<p>— 本報駐洛陽記者　范鴻</p>
<p>出洛陽城，過洛河，順洛南公路向南走，差不多走了十五里就可望見一大片被紅牆圍繞住的叢柏園林，這是洛陽著名的古蹟之一——關帝林。在關帝林的緊靠東面，門口一個小水湖，週團陪襯着荒凉悽慘的灰土和破垣，顯得格外冷落，這就是洛陽現在唯一的最高學府「焦作工學院」的所在地。</p>
<p>焦作工學院，簡稱焦工，是原來設在豫北道淸綫以出煤著名的焦作的。後來抗戰發生，廿六年敵人到了安陽，焦工就遷到西安。廿七年又遷到甘肅天水，七月又奉令與國立西北聯合大學工學院及國立東北大學工學院，合併改組爲國立西北工學院，設在陜西城固古路霸。至卅四年十月，呈准復校。繼以焦作爲共軍所佔，且破壞甚大，無法遷回，乃洽定洛陽關帝林舊傷兵醫院爲臨時校址，於卅五年十月招生開課。經院長張清璉一年來的慘淡經營，各部門雖設備簡陋，均已步入正軌，恢復過去的舊觀，且爲洛陽開創最高學府的始基，不能不使我們爲豫西爲工礦界爲我們十弟們慶幸！</p>
<p>焦工現有採礦冶金二系及先修班新生共一百六十餘人，分佈在一百多間空房及數十畝大的院庭內，相當舒適而緊湊。各科敎授，多係原來老人，是新成學校所趕不上的。</p>
<p>學生每天五時起床，八時上課，照課表一連上了七八節才結束了這一天的任務。晚上油燈，通亮了敎室和宿舍，到處是苦心思索鋼筆毛筆不住的沙沙沙的在劃着，寂靜的空氣，有點悶人，幾乎和每天早晨讀英文的情形大大相反。下課了，或者禮拜六，或者考試一畢，運動塲上的球迷並不多，最多的都到街上逛馬路坐茶館去了。關帝林街上近來越顯得荒凉，只有淸幽的茶館，有點像南方模樣，使人不由得思起南國，尤其是夕陽西下，微風飄動了綠蔭的時候，更使人有點流連忘返。</p>
<p>學生不但讀書風氣好，生活有規律，即是大家相處，雖然來自千萬里外，話音有點不同，和藹的空氣始終保持很澈底，從沒有爭執，更沒有打罵，這樣倒使訓導人員省工了。</p>
<p>每天下午差不多都到十里外的龍門煤礦去實習，這樣成羣結隊的照常前往，頗引起附近老百姓的注意，使他們知道住大學是不光吃閒飯擺架子的。</p>
<p>不過遺憾的是岡書館太空虛，課外的活動太沉寂，實騐設備都沒有運回來，考試不兔同兒戲。我們不能怪罪焦工，全國的學校，狠少不是犯這些毛病的。所以我們只能求到精神的獲得和勝利。</p>
<p>焦工創於民國紀元前三年三月一日，初由英商福公司履行合同開辦，名爲焦作路礦學堂。民四中原公司成立，與福公司合辦，改名福中礦務學校。民八又改名爲福中鑛務專門學校，開辦專門本科。民十適應學制，改名爲福中鑛務大學。民十五福公司停辦，經費全由中原公司供給。民廿始改名爲焦作工學院，增設土木工程科。廿二年又奉令改科爲系。現在經費，福中公司每月補助二千萬元（過去數月爲一千萬元），民生煤礦公司及龍門煤礦局各補助產煤百分之一，加上省府敎部及其他方面補助每月可在三千萬以上，除開支二千餘萬外，尙有小餘，前途發展，極爲樂觀。</p>
<p>本學期業已放學，本年度新生一百名，將在八月五六兩日，分別在洛陽開封兩地舉行。不過可惜的因爲院址狹小，先修班本年不再續辦，各系班次亦限制無法擴充，事實上將使幾千個高中畢業生望眼欲穿，求進無門了。</p>
<p>焦工畢業的學生，差不多遍佈了全國的每個角落，尤其淮南煤礦，焦作煤礦，民生煤礦，龍門煤礦，宜洛煤礦，究全是焦工校友的成績。</p>
<p>現在全國各院校，正在爲種種問題鬧着罷課，派代表·晋京·請願，開會等等風潮，獨有魚工沉寂的遠處在洛陽城十五里外的關帝林，安閒的躱過了這個風波，這不只是學校敎職員學生之幸，也是豫西地方之幸！我且祝福着焦工的永生·健强·光大！</p>

<h3>廣東省銀行總經理談　當前的僑匯問題　并提出改進僑匯政策的綱要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕廣東省銀行總經理劉佐人上月初自粤赴蘇州參加全國省銀行聯合年會後，刻正過滬返粵，　抽暇接見記者，就當前之僑匯問題，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>僑匯之重要，遇過係平衡我國國際收支之重要項目，今日為補充我國外　　金之主要源泉。對我國金融財政經濟，關係至為重大。</p>
<p>就各方面可　之統計，歷年僑匯數額如下：（單位國幣百萬元）：廿一年三二三，廿二年三〇五，廿三年二三二，廿四年三一六，廿五年三二〇，廿六年四五〇，廿七年六〇〇，廿八年一二〇〇，廿九年一八〇〇，卅年二四四，卅一年八六二，卅二年二四〇〇，卅三年一四八二，卅四年一月至八月二八六。</p>
<p>自廿五年起，僑匯已足彌補入超額而有餘。惟抗戰八年來，每年僑匯，平均約國幣十億元。數額雖較戰前增三位，惟因幣值貶跌關係，估計戰時每年僑匯實際數額，較戰前數額，約減三分之一以上。</p>
<p>復員以後，僑匯以外匯官價與黑市常發生差價，加以幣值日跌，以及匯兌時間延攔，手續煩瑣各種關係，僑匯之一般趨勢，日見減縮。估計復　後的每月全國僑匯總額，平均約為一百七十億元，全年約為二千億元。如以貶跌之幣值比例計算，則復員後之僑匯，約為戰前僑匯每年平均三億元的七分之一。</p>
<p>承滙機構</p>
<p>中國銀行承　僑匯數字，估計戰時每年約佔全國僑匯總額百分之五十。復員後因銀號·錢莊·批倍局等紛紛復業·中國銀行承匯僑匯此率，約减爲百分之三十。其餘百分之七十，大多由外商銀行或本國私家銀號批信局經匯，僑匯顯已大部逃避。</p>
<p>集中香港</p>
<p>目前我僑匯，不論美洲各國，或英國屬地，大多集中香港，故香港已爲僑匯逃避之中心。數月來因外匯黑市遠較官價爲高，僑匯逃港，與日俱增。據估計最近僑匯逃港，月達美金一千萬元。僑匯逃港結果，對我國經濟影　，頗爲京大，可分三點而運：（一）使我國失却彌補對外易人超之外匯源泉，今後國際牧文。　雜平衡。（二）僑匯流入外商　行之乎，成爲凍結資金，非特不曾投資於國內生產建設事業，且如變爲游資，參加投機活議，則更加深國內經濟危機。（三）直接助長香港繁榮，間接充實美鑄外　基金，以彌補英國國際收支之人超額。</p>
<p>改善方策</p>
<p>檢討過去僑匯政策渠認爲今後急待改進者，主要有下到各問題；（一）加强吸收僑匯網，（二）售　外滙外匯官價與市價之差額，（三）徵啻最售方法，（四）爲僑胞服務。</p>
<p>如何加强吸收僑匯，光應從放寬管制尺度與僑匯網着手。海外華僑，　處各地。除中國銀行　在海永各重要都市，增設分支停處外。同時應　許粤閩　省地方銀行，及其他辦理僑匯銀行，在海外僑胞較爲集中地區。廣設分支　構。對專事吸收中下層僑胞　款之批信局，銀行應與其密切聯緊。此外，各銀行仍應多覓代理店或通匯處、在國內更應增設解付僑匯機構。</p>
<p>如何消減外匯官價與市價差額，意見有三。（一）最好能使官價與市價趨於接名，隨時調整外匯，以消滅彼此差額。或根本取消官價，任由匯率穩定於自然水準。（二）實施補貼政策，補貼數額，必須隨時提高，最好由各地國家銀行，會同當地僑匯銀行，商議決定，以接近或不低於黑市匯價爲原則。（三）辦理外幣匯款及存款，即所謂原幣存款是。僑匯原幣返國，開戶存儲，解付時應照當日牌價及補貼辦法，支付國幣。</p>
<p>如何改義收付方法，收解應簡捷，手續應簡單，一切應科學管理，以求迅捷。辦理人員，態度尤應溫和有禮。</p>
<p>如何爲僑胞服務，意見有三；</p>
<p>（一）政府對海外華僑經濟，應協助其復員。（二）國內外各僑匯銀行，應增設一華僑服務機構，從中聯絡感情。（三）如遇僑胞或僑眷生活困難，或斷絕接濟，應舉辦低利貸款。</p>
<p>劉氏結語謂：當前僑匯問題，雖因官價與黑市相差太遠，而使僑匯逃避，但設能照上述改善辦法加以改進，亦不難獲得圓滿之解決。以今日華僑之衆，衹需我輩善爲引導，積極吸收，則僑匯前途，仍屬光明。</p>
<h3>複製業再爭配紗　原花原好轉紗產仍感不足</h3>
<p>紡調會之棉紗聨配工作，複製業本外埠共三吉餘家，實為其對象，年來此中糾紛，一直未解。此次聨配，因紗廠之受控制者已自本市擴展及黨錫吳等外埠，計受徵乏之紗廠為六十七個單位。範閣旣大，實力自厚。其試行之二萬件聯配辦法，據有關係方面透露消息，僅屬開端，尙非正常。因去年十一及十二兩月複配會承配時代，微發之紗廠僅限於本市，已月達二萬四千件也。如原棉接濟得以解決，配紗糾紛，可望减少。聞棉花進口商前向美國定成之花衣，價款早已繳淸，而因未合輸入限額分配手續，貨到而未獲動用者，爲數不少。其中衹就已到香港急待轉口者而言，已達四五十萬担。有關方面已擬具解凍方案，將由中央信託局收　，轉配於各紗廠。此外行總方面，亦在努力於洋花之進口。紗厰原料問題，不若外間所傳之嚴　。紡調會鄒主任會數與中央銀行張總裁商談及此。近來紗厰業對鄒尙能聽命，此端亦爲重要原因之一。至於配紗機關，去年九十兩月，亦會在聯配名詞下，於六區棉紡業公會辦理。但外間印蒙不佳，實配如何，傳說不一。此次紗厰業　申前議，紡調會對此，尙在縝密考慮之中。其中一部人主張機動，一部人則主張規律，大致不出此二途而已。本市複製業九個公會日前召開聯席會議，即席草就改進配紗意見之節略，送交紡調會，則主張應爲規律之公開配售，使紗厰之業務與利潤，保持正要。複製業之用紗，免於求諸黑市，且曾說明厰無分大小新老或本市外埠，在凡紗厰受紡調會控制範圍內，應按其生產設備，近來動態，爲均勻之定期配售。紗價則主張隨時協商，以保全紗厰之再生產成本爲原則。其節略中對於紡建現行配紗辦法，頗爲指摘。提及六區目辦聯配，尤表示不信任。則可見複製業對於紡調會舉措注意之深也。據複製業負責人諸人，最近之二個月，紡建配紗奇少。各該業所得，不足三成之用。黑市紗價之高，事所難免。最近紡調會議價爲二十支標準八百八十萬元，實際市價，則遠過於此。總因生產設備有限，產紗本不敷用之求。價隨市面，上漲勢所必然云。</p>
<h3>商討處理外棉　國行等定期開會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於本年四月底前業已抵埠，而無法在核配外棉限額內取得許可證之外棉一批，總傾約在美金八百萬元以上。原則憶決定由政府　收講，然後再啊交國民營各紗厰代紡代織。茲悉。爲商討該項外棉之詳細處理辦法計，中央銀行，中央信託局，審計部，中國紡建公司，第六區棉紡公會等、將各派代表，定於本週四下午，在中信局召開聯席會議云</p>
<h3>中信局訂講冰蛋　分批運銷英國</h3>
<p>中信局近受輸出推廣委會之委託，代表政府向中國冰蛋業同業公會訂　冰蛋四批，共計二千二百五十噸，用以運銷英國，每噸可售價二百英磅，購蛋款由中央銀行整付。聞冰蛋商均願意承受，除冰蛋二千餘噸外，該局前向冰蛋業訂講乾蛋片二百五十噸，亦係遝銷英國者，頃第一批五十噸已運往英國糧食部。據悉：英國糧食部及糧商，對我國蛋產極表贊許云。</p>
<h3>本月廿六日起實施　提高捲煙稅率　百分之百以外再征三分之一</h3>
<p>財政部上海貨物稅局，前擬於本月一日，對本市捲烟稅額，予以提增百分之二百，嗣經捲烟厰業公會召開捲烟業務硏究會，以近期捲烟正處霉季，實銷呆滯，特推派代表晋謁貨物稅局方局長，請求對捲烟貨物稅，照現行繳納稅額提高百分之一百，並希望延至八月一日開始實施。</p>
<p>茲悉：當局以羣季各厰减工，及銷路清淡，確屬實情，爲體恤商艱，並顧及稅收起見，決定新稅額爲普遍提增百分之一百外，再加新稅額總數之三分之一，即原稅每箱在六十萬元者，新稅額即應繳納一百六十萬元，並於本月廿六日即行開始實施。至各種捲烟有稅率相同，而售價尙有參差者，日內亦將由捲烟業務硏究會，提出調整，以示一律云。</p>
<h3>食油按戶配售　二十日前可實行</h3>
<p>食油按戶配售事宜，刻經有關當局積極籌備以來，業吿急轉直下，本月二十日前可望實行。其辦法與盒糖配售相同，印就購油證，由民政處發給各區轉發各戶，全市以四百十七萬人口計算，每人配油半斤，售價約在五千元左右、屈時再作最後決定。至於食油之來源，係由中央信託局將大豆委託本市七大油廠榨油，然後由油商公會會員商店經售。該局由東北運滬大豆二三〇〇噸，決於本週內分撥各厰代榨。惟本市人口，民政處戶口統計有四一七萬人，每次配油須二萬〇八百担，所缺之數，由靑市補足之。本月十五日首次配售，係豆油及生油，今後將以菜油爲主，惟待豆油積有相當數量，足供配售一次之需時，再行發配。</p>
<p>青導輸出過剩豆油</p>
<p>靑島市社會局林局長，昨由京過滬返靑，據稱：糧食部原則上已同意自靑島運出過剩豆油，藉以維持該處生產力，並以之調節京滬綫各埠食油供應之不足。運輸部份由國營招商局航行北洋綫谷班輪船儘先載運，如運輸情形正常，月可轉口三〇〇〇噸之數，本市爲食油重要消費地之一。</p>
<h3>軟木業製造商人　請禁止成品進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市軟木業近以進口外貨威脅，呈請經部請求政府禁止外貨軟木製品進口，工商輔導處爲此特於昨日召集軟木製造商開會商討。據悉軟木來自西班牙葡萄牙及北非，每年進口額約爲八十萬公斤，折合美金約四十萬元。在輸入統制辦法中，軟木列入非限額選口品之列，但自去年十一月份起，從未有軟木原料之入口。製造商方面希望政府能體諒商艱，准許軟木原料有四十萬美元之進口限額、但對於外國之軟木製成品，除有特別用途者外，其餘一律禁止進口。</p>
<h3>粉公會申請　繼續配售麵粉</h3>
<p>本市麵製食品業所需麵粉，上月份由中信局奉令繼續配售，其配價均照常局議價，惟七月份尙未開始配售，粉麩公會昨特派員赴中信局接洽，申請繼續配售。據該局負責人表示：配粉即可發售，仍將配售利浪洋粉，惟價格與出貨技術上尙待檢討。今日該會將續派員赴中信局接洽，可望有所決定。</p>

<h3>赴日經濟考察團　人數不致減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕赴日經濟考察團團長潘序倫，日昨由京來滬，對該團赴日之稱種準備，表示均由外交部接洽之中，不便看所洩露。據記者自另一方面探悉：自我國外交部去電東京交涉後，迄未得麥帥總部之答礙；惟外傳我國代表團人數將减少之說，恐不確實，因當初我國代表團決定人數時，當以過去之印度訪日團作為參考。有關人士估計本月之內，該團當可成行。</p>
<h3>卅五年度受押箱茶　收購價格難提高　不願政府收者可自由處理</h3>
<p>卅五年度受押箱茶，已於本月三日四聯總處理事會通過，由中信局收講。頃悉：中信局尙未正式奉到明令，關於收講事宜，確已着手準備，一俟通知到達後，即開始辦理。據中信局負責人談：此次收購之箱茶，決非强制行爲，如茶高能自行設法出口，不願交政府收購者，仍可自由處理。但到期不僅還貸款款者，自應按照條約予以處分。收購價格，曾由中央銀行與有有關各方，商定爲祁紅七十二萬元，屯綠六十萬元，閩紅五十五萬元，平綠四十八萬元，玉綠五十二萬元，溫紅溫綠三十二萬元。以受押之八萬箱計算，收購資金，需二百八十億元。聞茶高方面，希望酌予提高，恐難得政府之尤準。收講以後，仍由中信局負責外銷。所有各級品質，均須重加檢騐，凡不合標準者，一槪不進出口。又受押箱茶，本月十日即全部到期云。</p>
<h3>壽景偉考察臺灣茶業　認為前途仍可樂觀</h3>
<p>中國茶葉聯營公司經理壽景偉氏，上月十七日赴台，主持該公司開幕，並視察台灣省茶葉工業情况，已於週前返滬。記者往訪，承吿台灣茶葉概况。稱「合灣產茶地，以台北新竹爲主，所產以鳥龍茶·包種茶·紅茶爲大宗，其中尤以鳥龍茶蜚聲歐美近東各地。</p>
<p>台茶發達，始於漢族移居該地以後，最初僅供該地漢人消費，隨後產量日增，始外銷閩粤各省。一八六九年英人　特，將合茶二十一萬斤輸至紐約，是爲台茶運銷國外市塲之嚆矢。</p>
<p>日人治台時，更獎勵栽植，最盛時栽地面積佔四萬五千四百五十五甲，（按每甲合十四畝半，計佔地六十四萬九千〇九十四畝半）產量激增，最高額每年達二千六百萬斤。二次世界大戰期間，日人因糧食缺乏，將茶田改耕糧食，力謀糧食產量增加，致使規模宏大全部機器化的製造厰。台北四十九所，新竹五所，台中一百三十七所，高雄十二所，逐漸毁壞，台茶工業遂一落千丈。</p>
<p>戰前台茶產量在一九三六年粗製茶戶有二〇七二一戶，產額有一八·〇八一·四二六斤，精製茶戶有七三戶，產額有一七·四八五·七八三斤。勝利後，一九四六年精製茶（包括烏龍茶·包種茶·紅茶·綠茶）產量總額不過六百萬磅，（按每磅十二兩計算台四百五十萬斤）今年若不受久雨影饗，預計可產余五萬担。</p>
<p>一九三五年台茶外銷總數達一四一·八一五·六一六斤，勝利後，一九四六年十二日外銷中信公司紐約分公司四十萬磅，一九四七年又有一批七千箱運往中國銀行美國分行。</p>
<p>目前台灣銀行已承辦茶厰貸款，使其資金週轉，生產不致呆滯。省營茶葉公司分得茶貸合幣三億元，其他茶商及合作社分得茶貸四億九千萬元。中國聯營公司台灣銀行核准茶貸二億元。台灣一省茶貸共計九億九千萬元，若以七月三日所調整的台幣與法幣的比率計算，則九億九千萬合幣茶貸，合法幣六四·三五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。台灣全省茶貸已冠國內茶貸，合茶前途可抱樂戰。</p>
<p>然據聞有許多茶商，因物價上漲，成品售出，補不進原料，造成虛盈實虧的賬面，而瞞過檢騐人員的耳目，將陳茶複製，向國外市塲混銷，若聽其所爲，則台茶外銷之慘况，將不堪設想。台茶公司有鑒於斯，對下列的困難：（一）茶園的恢復，（二）物價影響到生產成本，（三）材料的補充，（四）茶農生活的不安定，（五）台胞不能瞭解政府的茶政等等，刻正積極覓求解救對策云。</p>

<h3>「七七」十週年　想當年看今朝</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>從「七七」蘆溝橋事件發生迄今，已經整　地十年了。</p>
<p>十年來，前方戰土浴血苦鬥，全國人民戮力輸捐，總算贏得了最後勝利。可是勝利之花，却結出了苦澀的果子。有人要問：七七的悲劇會重演麽？這不是危言聳聽，回憶七七以前的國內外情形，再看現在的局勢，自免不了杞人憂天。　七七雖是抗戰的序幕，但日本侵略的野心和陰謀，早巳在七七以前，孕育而長成了。九一八是侵略中國的初步，蘆溝橋是謀取華北的實現。日本具有侵略中國之心，　在甲午之前，併琉球，奪台灣，繼而由朝鮮問題，引起中日之戰。日機一戰，日本已在東北站定了脚跟。第一次歐戰，更一躍而為强國，從此對中國蠶食鯨呑，更趨積極。</p>
<p>日本雖久存併呑中國之心，然尙不敢公然發動戰爭，因其時中國軍閥　據，內戰擾　，故而利用軍　間相互之矛盾與猜忌，獲盡挑撥離間之能事，此外復乘機作經濟上之經營，獲取各種特權，以為日後侵略之貸本。彼所希　者，中國內亂不巳；所恐懼者統一，對於國民革命之北伐，設法阻擾，五三濟南慘案，即其阻撓北伐之表現。迨東北易幟，北伐完成，全國統一，建設開始，此後不能再逞其野心，於是始揭露其猙獰之面的惡果。</p>
<p>十年前，我國己告統一。建設雖纔開始，但工商業已略具雛型；財政雖非充裕，但尙不至如今日之枯竭，可是仍不免於爲野心者所乘。今經八年抗戰之後，所有建設，經砲火之摧毀，均巳殘缺不全，而民生益困·財政益拙，共黨若再不醒悟，從事於割地逞兵，則前車之鑒，實不勝其隱憂。</p>
<p>十年前，日本開始發動侵略戰爭的時候，大家認為這是孤注一擲，若是戰敗，必將不可收拾。結果日本是戰敗了，投降了，可是在戰敗的前夕，自東京至仁奈川，尙有十七師團的精兵，東京灣的海底裏，發現大量的黃金。這種種跡象，表示日本失敗而不潰，正像一個臨刑前的大盜，喊出了「二十年後又是一條好漢」一樣。盟軍登陸管制之後，日本復利用國際間的矛盾，爭取他復興的機緣，經濟方面，若干獨佔的大企業，像三井，三菱，住友等，名義上是解散了，其實乃是化整為零。工業仍維持一九三〇年到一九三四年的永準，鋼鐵的產量，規定的限額也不在少數，主要的輕工業，如紡織工業一項，即己有紗錠六百萬枚，布機二十萬台，為遠東各國所不及。最近宣稱開放對外貿易，不啻替日本工業打開了一條復興之路。而對千島羣島的漁權，台灣移民的特權，和共管流球的要求，更證明其勃勃的野心，大有「東山再起」的企岡。日本雖是戰敗者，可是昔日軍國主義的思想並未根除，現在和約尙未締結，已開始重溫侵略蠶食的舊夢，使戰勝的中國，回憶十年前情景，不免要目，演出了九一八的一幕。</p>
<p>東北旣失，國聯未加制裁，使日本侵略野心，得寸進尺，一面建立偽滿洲國，一面再向關內進逼，叩榆關，攻熱河，都是蘆溝橋事件的先聲。日寇那時所以如此猖獗者，乃認進攻中國為不可失去的良機。蓋其時正値世界經濟恐慌最嚴重的時候。美國在　斯福總統登台以後，又忙於內政的措施，希望克服國內的經濟危機。在歐洲，希特拉登台後，積極欲謀解脫凡爾賽和約之束縛，使英國無暇東顧。蘇聯亦專心於五年計劃的實施。同時，軍縮會議失敗以後，美國雖在一九三二年開始撥款建設海軍，但羅斯福表示仍願縮軍，英國亦維持倫敦華府海約之規定，惟日本則仍暗中積極擴充，迨一九三五年倫敦軍縮會議失敗後，日本退出海會，更公然大舉造艦，以此日本海軍，大有超越英美之勢。凡此種種情形，正造成了日本侵略中國的　會。</p>
<p>日本侵略中國的野心，旣非一日，故準備充裕，經營積數十年之久，貧弱的中國，固不足與之抗衡。然而中國竟能與日寇周旋八年，獲得最後勝利者，皆由於精神上之力量，全國上下，統一團結所致。勝利之後，本宜從事建設，恢復戰時所損失之元氣，走上民族國家復興之大道。詎意共黨逞兵，破壞統一，以致烽火再起，人民重遭兵　之災。破碎的產業不能重興，斷缺的交通不能恢復，而經濟更見桔竭，民生益趨凋敝，這些都是共黨所造成問：「七七會再來麽？」</p>
<p>八年抗戰的根源是東北，勝利後東北迄未完全接收，而在西北的邊　又發出了警號。一個脫離中國而獨立朱滿兩年的外蒙，居然也率兵稱雄，向他昔日的宗主國進犯，實不得不令人警惕萬分。外蒙與新疆，犬牙相錯，為我國西北之屏障。為人覬親，已非一日，因外蒙之醞釀獨立，而變故叢生。新裏地處邊陲，民族複雜，政府因國中多故，無暇兼顧。前次伊寗事變，中樞苦心應付，始將隔己久之新疆，重新聯繫起來。伊寗事變後之新疆，宛如昔日之東北易幟，而外蒙軍隊之侵入，又無異「九一八」之另一幕表現了！</p>
<p>新疆西倚葱嶺，外圍高山環繞，僅天山北麓，與外蒙接壤，平沙一片，無險可守。而遊牧民族，生活其間，馳騁數百里，視為常事。自民國十年庫倫失守後，外蒙組府，唐努鳥梁海獨立，北方落離，早己撇除。今新掀風鼓浪告警、不禁令人回想到過去之外蒙。况新疆土地，倍於東北，新疆之寳藏，有金，煤，　，油，原始的森林，廣大的牧塲，最近又發現了鈾　，要引起外人之垂涎其蘊藏之實，不下於東北，其地位重要倍　於東北。從前在東北演出的一幕，是否會搬到西北來重演呢！</p>
<p>考過去歷史，在每次戰爭之後，必有一番和平運動，但在這次大戰以後，却覺得有些例外，雖然成立了聯合國的機構，但消弭不了世界的危機。本來，我國經八年抗戰之後，各國已經認識中華民族的精神，可以克服，物質上的貧乏。若在勝利之後，從事建設，達到相當的水準，不難安定遠東，為世界和平奠下基石。豈知共黨逞兵，破壞統一，將一朵美麗的勝利之花，弄得凋萎破碎。眼看日本坐大，耳聽西北告警，這「七七」以前的種種情景，又怎能不重現在我們的眼前？在這時機，共黨正應懸崖勒馬，澈底反省勿為國家民族之罪人！</p>
<h3>我們的新外交政策之力量</h3>
<p>— 周頌西譯</p>
<p>原文載六月份美國一讀者文摘」中，係前美國駐蘇法大使蒲立德WiltiamC.Bullitt所著，詳述蘇聯對於全世界之野心及以各國共產黨為工具之情形。文中稱謂如「我們」，「我們的」，均係指美國而言，本文未易一字，蓋存眞也。譯者識</p>
<p>一切民主國家覺得面臨不愉快事實之困難，而寗願留戀於幸福的幻影。直至事到臨頭，方始覺悟，若我們之在珍珠港所身受者然。</p>
<p>我們知道，在二次世界大戰中，希特拉若能將歐菲兩洲的國家組織起來，以攻擊西半球，日本的軍閥若能將亞洲的國家組織起來，而作同樣的攻擊，則我們將遭遇致命的危險。今天史進林的目的，乃二者兼而有之（即希特拉之目的及日本軍閥之目的）我們在二次世界大戰所犧牲，及由勝利而獲得之結果，行將使歐洲，近東，遠東及非洲均為蘇聯所統治。我們現已面臨此種慘痛之可能，無論我們喜歡與否，此乃今日非常重要之事實。如詢以「由於何種判斷之錯誤，而造成了此含有毒素的勝利之果實？」其答案乃非常明瞭，就是我們的政府在一九四一年開始，誤認蘇聯為愛好和平的民主國，而並非以掠奪為事，一心一意欲征服世界的獨裁國。因此在歷史上造成了一極不幸的錯誤，當敎們的軍隊以超度的機巧，及勇氣，從事於戰爭及執行我們的外交政策時，未曾注意到美國人民生死有關的利益，史達林之具有征服世界之野心，一如希特拉，而我們對之沒有盡什麽力，予以阻止而保衛自已。</p>
<p>我們希望渠能轉變為一溫厚而愛好和平者，以是在德黑　，雅爾達，波次頓會議席上，不斷的予以渠所要的權利，甚至前國務卿貝納斯在一九四五年就犧時，亦以爲能與史達林善以相處。歷時數月始覺史達林之野心一無止境，而僅能以堅決之反對止之。</p>
<p>貝納斯獲得此種苦痛敎講時，（此乃全體美國人遲早必將得到者），對於蘇維埃的帝國主義很勇敢的予以拒絕。當蘇聯行將侵略土耳其時，他設法予以阻止，而使東地中海免掉這一種侵略的恐慌。由於支持伊朗政府，而使之能將佔領伊朗北部之蘇　經紀人掃除之。此兩事足以證明史達林尙未敢冒險與美國用兵力相周旋，我們今日較强於蘇聯者多多，而史達林知之。</p>
<p>我國今日之地位很像法國在一九三六年三月一樣。在那時法國的空軍陸軍為世界上最强者。但是希特拉尙敢派兵深入萊舊區，而開始其征服之生活。我們業已得到證據可以證明當時希特拉深知法國如能動員，則能壓倒德國，若法國動員則不得不發令將軍隊撇回之。但是法國動員須費甚鉅，當時法政府要平衡預算，又動員要使人民與家庭及事業相離，在政治方面亦不適於民心，並且還有許多誠實而受着歪曲報導影響之法人誤信希特拉決不欲傷害法國者，正像今日有人强辯史達林不會來危害美國一樣，因此當時法國一無動作。</p>
<p>當希特拉準備就緒，立即壓倒了法國，法國在一九三六年不敢面臨事實，以致自招滅亡。</p>
<p>希特拉當佔領了一戰略區域，作為向該國發動攻勢之基地時，對於未來之被犠牲者必先予以安慰，而使之入於安全之幻覺，此即希特拉征服戰略之原則，亦即史達林戰術之原則，他的戰術乃完全無異於希特拉者：第五縱隊，宣傳，訂立條約，撕破條約，恐嚇及軍力。但是希特拉從未在渠所欲征服之國家內培成了非常陰險而有力量之工具若史達林之共產黨及旅行於各地之同志們。現在時間之不利於我們，正如一九三六年三月後之不利於法國一樣。一夭一天使我們接近俄國原子彈的發展。蘇聯的大量生產力仍為戰爭而生產，史達林之統治東歐及中歐日見其成功，他能利用擁有一萬萬以上人口的廣大無邊之區域的資源向我們　戰。史達林業已合併了愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，立陶宛及芬蘭波蘭及克斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞等國之若部分，並已將波蘭全國，羅馬尼全亞國，保加利亞全國，巨哥斯拉夫，亞爾巴尼亞及德國，奧國之紅軍地帶均置於統治之下。渠對於業已握在鐵拳中之匈牙利，捷克斯拉夫及芬蘭等國，其緊握之程度日見加增。並對於希臘及土耳其施以極大之壓力，而希土兩國如無外力之援助，則對於蘇聯不能予以抵抗，他的第五縱隊正在努力將德國全境予以共產化。他在法意兩國之經紀人勢力甚大，業已强迫該兩大國之政府接受若輩之首領為國務員矣。　史達林的力量正在全世界取攻勢，而諸民主國家則在退縮中，要阻止他去聯合歐亞非三大洲的力量來向西半球作決定性的攻擊，這是今天為美國最關心的事，我們對於凡受蘇維埃帝國主義威脅諸民族，不能同時予以足够之助力。我們必須愼選若干要點，以應用我們所有的力量。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統業已將第一優先權給予希臘及土耳其，該兩國顯然已臨近被侵略之災禍，其急迫程度次於希土者為法國，蓋法國之地位亦在生死存亡中，此乃全世界面臨我們諸問題之一，容常予以詳盡之研究。</p>
<p>若史發林賴渠第五縱隊去統制法國得以告成，則法政府將成為我們的敵人，法國之人民將在共產黨特務及砲隊之壓力下，服從他的命令，我們行將面臨史達林空軍之威脅矣。</p>
<p>法國如為史達林所統制，則歐洲將成為共產黨的天下。意大利的共產黨特別的强，定將隨入史達林之掌握歐亞兩洲將成為介於兩大洋之廣大的共產大陸而在德國西部之英美地帶將成為該大陸上之一小小的　形地，至英美軍隊撤退而後已，英國將有受俄楓火箭攻擊之可能，而較之以前德國在法國所放者更為强烈，並將飽嘗大炸彈若馬爾太島然，歐洲較小之國家行將一個一個的淪亡，歐洲而為共產黨所治理，而直接聽侖於莫斯哥則美國之感受危險，一若歐洲為納粹所統治，而直接聽命於柏林也。</p>
<p>今日共產黨在法國為最大之政黨，但是小黨很多，以致議員中百分之七十二為非共產黨員、在一們精神物質道德均屬正常之民主國家中，共產黨自不能涉足於政府，惟法國在物質上之損失很重，非共產黨諸領袖不得不用盡心計以圖恢復，以是共產黨利用總罷工之威脅，業已脅迫其他政黨予以政府中之高位。今日若輩之著名領袖陶萊士，即二次世界大戰法國陸軍中之逃兵，充了副總統，而共產黨員業已做了國防　，勞工，衛生，及復興等部的部長。</p>
<p>法國空軍之地上人員，現在幾乎全為共產黨所統制，且其中許多官員均為共產黨員，至於陵軍本身已有許多黨員，此外共產黨還有其自已的裝備優良的地下部隊，人數比法國之正規軍還要多，巴黎的人很自由的說：「史達林如欲接管法國，無論何時來一電話就可巳做到」。</p>
<p>若法國國會中之大多數非共產黨之領袖們，決意組織一全國聯合政府，而反對少數之共產黨，則我們當予以必需之援助，使之能維持一民主的政府，奈麼，并且我們還　帮助他們去成立法國的經濟機構。法國基本的經濟地位是健全的，如能將共產黨予以控制，則凡欲再成一更强盛的民主國家諸需要，當予以助力，以彌補在戰爭時及德人佔領時所遭受之荒蕪。</p>
<p>若法國而能成為一民主國，則可將歐洲之民主國家團結起來，以保衛自己，此為一萬全之方法，亦却為我們保衛之方法。如歐洲之大部份不能成為一民主的聯合體，則全歐洲將在蘇維埃暴政之下聯合了。</p>
<p>希臘，土耳其，法國，中國——還有多少國家需要我們的助力？或者還有不少國家，凡為我們力所能及，我們必當援助之。今日我們的國力之强盛遠在蘇聯之上，我們之所以能避免與蘇聯發生公開之戰爭的唯一機會亦即在此。我們應有先見，能力及勇氣，以阻止史達林去統制新的戰略區域，並應組織全世界之自由民族，以抗拒蘇縱埃帝國主義，以使蘇維埃獨裁者時時遇到優越的力量，那種力量必須非單是軍事的，經濟的，而必須理想的。</p>
<p>如欲以主義去戰勝共黨之謊言，及扭歪之　眞理，勛我們自有聖經、權利　，及林肯在獨立廉之演說在，而無須遠求，在林肯之演說中，渠曾自詢「何種偉大的主義能維持我們各州的團結」。其所答為「這就是在獨立宣言中那種理想，不但欲使本國的人民能得到自由，並且盼望全世界在永久之將來均能之」，此種理想，即我們所欲保衛者，亦即我們所欲貢獻於全世界者，在理想的田野中，自由就是我們的原子彈。</p>
<p>具有野心的人們能為共產主義所驅使，而向我們所珍視民主國家，予以攻擊，此實難於相信的，但果如是也，如我們現在不正視敵人，而不覺察該敵人乃又强盛，又兇惡，又狡猾，又殘忍，並不識眞理，仁慈，善意為何物，則我們將不及自救矣！</p>
<h3>濟南萬象</h3>
<p>— 濟南六月廿九日航訊本報特派員天</p>
<p>只要是讀過老殘遊記的人，沒有不被它煊染美化得旖麗如江南的濟南為之悠然，為之神往的。雖然，今天在濟南已只是城北部份，依然尙可勉强够得上稱「家家流水，戶戶垂揚」；所謂「四面桃花三面柳，一城山色半城湖」（大明湖聯），早不如易為「四面八路三面匪，一城難民半城兵」來得這眞，也來得更踏實了。</p>
<p>經過八年抗戰兩年內竄的濟南，在沒有到過的人們，也許早認為如國內其他城市一樣，已被摧毀得面目全罪，焦頭　額了，但正相反地，濟　除了普利門外法院舊址一度毀現巳重建外，走　全市，簡首　不到一點破壞的痕跡。據熟悉濟南的人告訴我；由於韓復　的大退却，敵　在濟南總共只丟了兩個不到廿磅重的小型炸彈，敵寇旣陷濟南後，因以濟南為　北補給最大基地，拼侖建設，拼命擴展，除將前德國人在城西所開闢的商埠區北部擴展二三華里，作為工廠區外，並將商埠區以南一直開　到四里山和馬鞍山的山根，建築了許多嶄新的洋房，而成為相當理想的住宅區，此項新擴充的新建設，就面積論，幾乎超過抗戰前舊濟南的一倍，而縱橫十餘條寬闊的柏油馬路。也使濟南點綴得「像煞有介事」，初具了一切現代都市應具的規模。抗戰勝利初期。</p>
<p>在同一個濟南市</p>
<p>嘗一度住着三位山東賓政府主席，那就是中央的何思源，中共的黎玉，和偽組織的楊毓珣，楊是「洪憲皇帝」袁世凱的駙馬爺，當時因何前主席隻身入魯，兵單力薄，楊偽主席在敵偽軍支持下，餘　猶在，而黎玉自「徂徠山七人起義」後，部隊早已擴充至廿萬餘人，此時濟市四郊佈滿了他的部隊，他以兵臨城下的姿態也正嚷着與中央向日軍第四十三軍軍司令官細川忠康中將爭受降，再加以此時兵匪難分之各縣地方團隊雜處其間，司令滿街，難民遍地，因此謔而虐者遂將大明湖聯稍易數字而成為「四面八路三面匪，一城難民半城兵」了</p>
<p>直到卅四年雙十節，李延年奉命來濟辦理受降楊偽主席等漢奸奉命逮捕後，濟南的局勢較前始略見安定，但繼續下來，黎玉因爭受降未成，對於濟南便一直硬打軟困，而勝利初期的若干「刦收」現象，對積年淪陷民衆亦頻增無限隠痛，直到卅五年春，王躍武奉侖來濟指揮軍事，收拾人心，局勢始趨大定、否則據若干有資格者觀察，今天的濟南，究演變至如何情狀，實在是不堪想像的。</p>
<p>濟南在抗戰前人口不到四十萬，自勝利後，因四方多難，各縣難民塵集，人口一度增加至近八十萬，上月以來，以津浦路徐濟段再度打通，一部難民還鄕，人口减至七十萬弱（不包括軍隊）。人口增加後住為第一個嚴重問題，雖因敵寇在濟南留下來很多建築，雖因山東人一向豪邁尙義，每個濟南人家裏，幾乎都成了難民收容所，收留着各縣流亡來或多或少的他們的非親即友，但終因人口驟增，部隊衆多，房荒一天天顯得嚴重，尤其是商埠區，雖尙無須金條論價，但憑麵粉講租金，也就够使客居的人們焦心了。</p>
<p>據王市長崇武說：濟市七十萬人口中至少一半是難民，而此卅五萬難民中又至少有廿萬是仰仗救濟來維持生活的，他們過去主要的靠聯總的麵粉用以工代賑的方式來築馬路修黃河堤，但八月起行總魯靑分署即將結束，那時除非外圍局勢大開展，難民們可以重返家園，各安生業，否則他們的生活也就隨着成為最嚴重的問題了。</p>
<p>由於人力的過剩，失業人數雖無確數可資查考、但其數目的驚人是不難想見的，乞丐滿街，見人便老爺太太，可頭如搗蒜，尤以尙在十歲左右的學齡兒童為最多。勞力普通便宜到只要供給伙食，因照目下濟市物價，吃窩窩頭一個月一人至少也得廿餘萬。當你出門並且是步行時，只要衣衫穿得比較整齊，五百步內你可能經常遇到七八位人力車夫問你「坐車麼」？而使你感到應付他們簡直是一種額外的苦事，他們又那裏知道這些人們也正因物價的高壓數迫着不得不「安步當車」呢？</p>
<p>濟市大小店舖十萬家，幾乎十之七八是靠出賣存貨過日子。由於營業淸淡，人民購置力一再降低，每日營業收入，往往不敷一天的開支，這樣自然再無餘力購進新貨，當你走到每家舖子門首，從玻璃窗望進去雖然一樣是滿櫃滿窗，似乎顯示得「進貨充足」的模樣，但據若干商界朋友的老實話：　窗內成匹的布實際上多只是外面包上幾圈充門面，裏面的「心子」多是大得使你看到了會嚇壞人的。去年年底，據調查被迫淸理的達五七二家，向市府社會局請求停業未邀批准的三千餘家。最近有友自港滬來，我陪他上了一次這裏淸唱及大鼓最有名的靑蓮閣，茶資每位雖只二千元，但出乎意料的坐在側廂內打扮得花枝招展的歌女至少有廿五六人而坐在正廳的聽衆不過十餘人、形成了最大的諷刺。全市六家電影院兩家平劇院的觀衆，二分之一以上爲軍人，院方為示優待，對軍人减售半票，這自然影響戲院的收入，但據兼理着一家電影院的本報濟南分銷處負責人告訴我：目下能勉强維持營業的主要還是仰仗這批軍人觀衆，一般老百姓運二千元一張票的電影也無力享受，委實已窮到骨頭裏去了。</p>
<p>濟南的風景區</p>
<p>千佛山和四里山早就駐上了隊伍，老百姓輕易不准入內。商埠區的中山公園雖可自由出入，但園的面積小到還沒有外灘公園一半大，際茲炎夏，園中遊人如織，厠身其間，實如被納入罐的沙了魚一樣。至於號稱水都擁有七十二名泉的濟南舊城區，許多名泉今天大部份早就徒存其名，最有名的的突泉今天已被用作自來水廠的蓄水池，珍珠泉則在警察局內，老百姓輕易不能入內，其他如擁有歷下八景佔全城三分之一的大明湖，雖有遊覽的價值，但　艇一只，泛湖一週的代價是五六萬元，亦非常人力所能勝。因此許多人都說濟南正如一口井，而剩下來的一般中層階級所認為唯一最大的享受只是化二三萬元洗一次澡，但是據三馬路濟市最大一家洗澡堂銘新池的老閣說：戰前甚至淪陷期間他們的營業平均每日達三千人，現在平均每日只是一百多人，確然的，物價高漲使人視洗澡不僅是除垢渫污，簡直也是一種高度的享受了。</p>
<p>濟南的公敎人員在過去其窮苦為各省冠物價高，薪給低，尤其是即此待遇，亦不能按月發放，即發亦必七折八扣，本年以來，經王兼主席多方籌措，中央於調整公敎人員待遇時復將濟南與京滬同樣列入第一級，再加以制服，布疋，麵粉等的配給或配購，大家這才感到已勉强可以透口氣。至於學生，一萬餘中學生中有八千多是被迫由「解放區」流亡出來的，家中慘遭「鬥爭」，接濟毫無，過去多憑每月四萬八千元一月的公费生貸金，實際上只能維持一星期，因此救署所配發的黃色下其布料，不得不被迫出售而輾轉成了中下層公務人員的中山大禮服，學生於典盡當光之餘又多被迫着做短工，無工可做的被迫着由三合麵，麩皮，吃到野草根榆樹皮、他們生活够艱苦，但他們很淸楚這是誰使他們受的　，他們只作合理的呼籲，他們可從未罷過課。因此，一方經政府將公费底數提高，一方由王耀武及山東新報所倡導的捐獻一日所得後，三週以來，已捐及認捐的總數已達兩億餘元，這在貧入骨髓的濟南，不能不算是偉大同情心的最高度也是最具體的表示了。</p>
<p>假使你初來濟南人們一定會告訴你濟南的「三不」，就是「馬路不平，電話不淸，電燈不明」。其實，除了城郊若干馬路有如蜂窩外，城區尤其商轉區的平滑柏油路，在國內各大省會中，還是不可多見、電話因機器過老，市內通話遠不如京滬之長途電話。雷燈則因公司存煤告罄，虧累過鉅，除軍政機關外，連這不明的電燈在一個月前也早就停止供應，商舖為了營業清淡，節省燃料，（洋油市價為二百萬元一大桶，一度并高至二三〇萬元，）雖在夏夜，不到十點鐘，也早就息燈打烊，全市陷入黑暗中，十一時半戒嚴開始後，各街口鐵絲網栅欄一道道關起，各大小堡壘的士兵荷槍實彈站定後，全市宛如進入另一種境界。槍聲砲聲對濟市居民比爆竹還要熟悉，不管是白天或黑夜，不管是國軍的演習或共軍的攻擊，反正他們對王耀武是具有絕對的信心，他們仍然可以高枕安眠的。</p>
<p>濟市目下因</p>
<p>存煤不多價又昂</p>
<p>除了仁豐，成大，成通東亞等得天獨厚的少數紗廠或麫粉廠繼續開工外、其餘十之七八皆已停工，現下濟市的煤價、已高到二百五十萬元一噸，零售一千五百元一市斤，貧苦之家，為着燒飯，多只能每次購二三斤用布帕包着帶回家，他她把這些許的煤末，譬作「烏金墨玉」一樣的珍貴，這在炎夏，在苦寒的北國如冬季來到後，可又怎樣辦呢？</p>
<p>據過去經騐，每屆冬季，月需煤三萬餘噸，目下津浦路徐濟段打通，魯西南泰安·新泰·寗陽·曲阜·一帶用土法開採的六個煤礦估計月產萬餘噸、此時如即從事運儲，今冬或可免凍餒，但是把在當前的困難是運輸工具的缺乏，省公路局白備卡車不足十輛，商軍雖有七八十輛，但又要忙着比煤更重要的糧食的槍搶，至於津浦路徐濟段，最快也得本年年底始能通車，膠濟路即使馬上打通，由於材料缺乏，通車更遙遠無期、在交通情形如此困難下，於是相反地，由共區流入濟市的棉花以及農民因戰亂無法耕種致將耕牛斬殺後所薈集濟市的牛皮，因有利可圖，反一躍而成為飛機階級源源不斷地向外運走，同時濟市所僅存的汽車自行車零件及五金材料，甚至黃金布匹等，又紛紛向共區流去，這種極不正常物資交流總算或多或少點綴了濟市繁榮活躍的一面。目前濟南所遭遇到的困難，也正同北部中國各大城市所遭遇的困難完全一樣，人民都在期待着安定的明天。</p>

<h3>大學潮之後論改造教育</h3>
<p>— 周緝熙</p>
<p>當這空前的動盪全國的大學　之後，本學期匆忙結束，下學期轉瞬即來。敎育當局與敎界人士、如再不愼重將事，策劃將來，大刀闊斧，改造敎育，非但敎育前途，不堪設想；建國大業，亦將受害無窮。茲敬就管見所及，略陳改造敎育的方法數端於後，以就正於國人，並盼敎育當局與敎界同仁採擇施行。</p>
<p>第一，敎育民主化。民國三十四年敎育團體聯合年會通過第一案為確定敎育政策，其原則：（一）在學術方面，應有研究學術之自由，（二）思想上應有信仰發表之自由，（三）學術及文化團體應有設立之自由。而在行政上應採取積極作風，在原案中指出：（一）中央與地方之敎育事業範園確切劃分，分層負責；（二）行政方法以督導代替干涉，以輔助代替放任，以自動代替被動，以信仰代替防範，以迅連代替遲滯，以客觀標準代替主觀褒貶，（三）獎勵私人與辦敎育事業與從事研究實騐工作。上面所說這幾點，可以說就是敎育民主化的原則和方法。因為有了研究學術今發表思想以及設立學術文化團體之自由，敎育才能民主化，學術思想才能發達，敎育文化才能進展。現在的敎育行政與學校行政以及一切敎育設施，則往往是沒有自由，不能民主；不是過分干涉，便是完全放任；不是處處被動，便是時時防範；至於敎育描施的遲滯寡效，敎育獎懲的只憑主觀，那更是極普　的現象。這都是敎育失敗，學潮迭起的內在原因。所以我們要改造敎育，培養優良的學風，必須尊重自由，實行民主：循循善誘，督導靑年；誠懇親愛，輔助學生；引發靑年自動，使之自强不息，自治治學；實施人格感化，使學生心悅誠服，尊師重道；一切敎育設施，必須迅速確實，發生意外事件，立即明快應付，依法合理解決；考查敎育成績，須憑客觀標準，尤應大公無私，鐵面無情，評定優劣，依法獎懲。能如是，敎育才能民主化，並能消弭學潮於無形，美成優良的學風，而得美滿的敎育成果。所以敎育民主化是當這空前的大學潮之後，改造教育的當務之急。</p>
<p>第二，分配合理化。現在我國教育上有一個極不合理的分配。就大學敎育說，據最近調查，全國有公私立大學五十三所，其中設在上海的有十一所，設在北平的有五所，設在廣州的有四所，設在南京，武昌，成都的各三所；以上六大都市共設有大學二十九所，佔全國大學總數二分之一以上？上海一市所有的大學，竟佔全國大學總數五分之一强。而新疆，靑海，西康等省則沒有一個大學。他如獨立學院及專科以上學校，也是集中於幾個大都市。中等學校，亦集中於各省省會與都市。有人說，中等以上學校敎育，尤其是大學敎育，不必也不能求其均衡發展，因為敎育的發達，需要社會文明的進步，尤其是一個大學，須要辦在文化水準最高的大都市，才能吸收現代文明，研究高深學術，而有新的創造，新的發明與發現，推動楚個肚會，人類文化繼續不斷的向前適進。是的，敎育需要社會，社會也需要敎育；文化落後的社會，需要發展敎育、以促進文明的進步，正如文化落後的中國，需要發展敎育、以促進國家的現代化一樣。所以我們可以說，社會因敎育發展而進步，敎育因社會進步而發展。因此在環境許可的範圍內，對於高等敎育與中等敎育，都應求其合理的分配，均衡的發展。近來江浙一帶的學潮，英大的遷校運動，發生最早。英大校址問題，敎部為求分配的合理化而設在金華，英大學生以金華不夠設立大學之條件而主張遷校。平心而論，金華據浙贛路之中點，南濱東陽江，有舟楫之利，北臨金華山，有林整之勝，城內有中學四五所、附近各縣又有中學多所，其文化程度雖不甚高，敎學上不無不便之處，但以其環境恬靜，頗適於陶冶學子心靈，培育青年高尙的品德，敎部如能於圖書設備方面，敎師待遇方面，處處求其合理化，並得賢能之校长領導於上；例如該校何故校長炳松先生不死，並仍在金華主持校務，則此次要求遷校的學潮，或不至於發生，亦未可知。所以我們要求敎育上地區分配的合理化，同時並須要求關書設備等分配的合理化；即文化程度較低地方的學校，尤其是大學，其圖書設備的分配，要比分配給辦在大都市裏的大學還要來得多來得好來得充實，例如最近聯總補助我國復員區院校的工，農，醫三科敎學設備的分配，就應該根據這個原則求其分配的合理化。其敎師待遇，也要較辦在大都市裏的大學來得僵厚，並予以寒署假期赴大都市研究考察的費用，而出國進修的敎授，他們應有擾先權。並可利用寒暑假期，選派學工學醫的學生至大都市的大工廠大醫院實習，或學習一種在當地學不到的科學技術。在可能範圍內，可常領導學生至大都市參觀與其所學有關的事物。其校長人選，尤當特別愼重，必須敦聘德高望重才學並茂之第一流學者前往主持校務。能如是，則大學雖辦在文化水準較低的地方或邊遠的省區，亦不致發生學潮。所以要求敎育地域上分配之合理化，須使圖書設備等方面分配的合理化，才能改造敎育。為求敎育地區上分配之合理化，敎育當局，應視社會的需要，因地制宜的辦理與其地方建設事業有關的專科學校或獨立學院，然後再因社會的進步，地方的需要，慢慢的充擴為大學，不必一開始就創辦一所包括三個以上學院的大學，至於集中在各大都市的大學，如能促使牠們脫離繁　喧閙的大都市，遷往尙無大學之較小都市或邊遠省區，而求分配的合理化，那當然是很好，但亦不可過於勉強，以致引起風波，發生學潮。在這萬分動亂的國家肚會裏，政府要求學校地區分配之合理化，應該愼重將事，切不可操之過急，才能消弭學潮，安定敎育。</p>
<p>第三，加　視導制度。敎育視導制度，是由敎育行政機關，設置視導人員，根據法定標準，視導敎育實施的程度。美國視導人員，約分兩種；一爲視導敎學，一為觀導行政。各　縣市敎局，都設置視學員。英國有中央視學員和地方視學員，每一地方視學員，必附從於敎部視學員之下，而與之合作。為强迫兒童入學，各地方政府又設入學督促員，蘇聯的視導制度分邦與地方兩級。邦視學員為邦敎育委員之代表，其任務在考察學務，並助公共敎育的改進。地方視學員的職務與邦視學員相似，不過其視導區域較小而已。我國視導制度，中央與省縣市，都各設有督學；但因其人數不多，素質不高，各級督學，往往走馬看花，視而不導。敎育上有甚麽問題發生，旣不能洞燭於機先，而防患未然，又不能善處於其後，而社絕後患。近來學潮的此伏彼起，動盪全國，視導組織的不健全，也是原因之一。所以我們當這大學潮之後論改造敎育，必須加强視導制度。在中央方面應數請德高望重的第一流學者為部轉督學，並尊崇其地位，優厚其待遇，分赴各大學講學，說明為學，做人，治事，處世接物之要道，指導靑年之思想與行為，使靑年聽過他的一席話，勝讀十年書，並由他介紹名流學者至各大學作學術演講，及與敎授們取得密切聯繫，指導各大學學術研究工作，解決其困難問題與處理臨時發生的意外事件。敎育當多對於高等敎育的視導，應重在學校行政方面，對於中小學敎育的視導，應重在敎學方面；敎學方面的視導，應着重在科學實騐與實習之能否切實的多多的去做，練習簿，作文簿、實騐報告與實習報告等之能否勤快的做，仔細的改。體育方面，則應着重早操，課間操與課外運動等健身運動之能否人人參加天天舉行，而不重在訓練少數爭奪錦標的運動員，總以普遍化大衆化促進全體學生之健康為目的，地方敎育行政敎學校行政的視導，則應有精密周詳的視察，看出優點缺點的所在，予以應興應革的切實指導，尤應居心公正，態度和平，切不可有所偏依，或抱着居高臨下的官僚習氣。對於熱心敎育，成績卓著之敎育工作者，應呈報政府了以獎勵。對於歷史悠久，成績優良，供獻極大的學校，應即呈報政府，增加其經費，充實其內容，使之作更善的努力與更大的貢獻。例如國立交通大學，私立南通學院等校，都有悠久的歷史，擾良的成續，前者對於交通事業，後者對於紡織工業，都有極大的貢獻。倘政府能予以獎掖，使之充分發展，則對於實業建設與建國大業，必將有更大更多的貢獻。至於學店式的學校，經督學查明後，則不論其為中學或大學，均應呈請當局，予以取締，以免誤人子女，貽患國家社會。各級視導人員，在橫的方面與縱的方面，均應取得密切的聯繫，並多多舉行敎育視導會議，討論當前敎育上所發生的問題及其　決的途徑，並研究如何改造敎育等問題。</p>
<p>總之，敎育民主化，分配合理化，加強視導制度，都是在這大學潮之後，改造中國的敎育應應有的措施。不知質之高明以為如何？</p>
<h3>鄭成功史料展覽會　臺南市政府籌辦</h3>
<p>— 六月卅日臺南航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>代表台灣精神的鄭成功，其　功偉績，堪以驚天地，泣鬼神，不但是本島人士所崇敬，亦為東西古今所仰戴的民族英雄。</p>
<p>台南市政府決定於本月六日起至九日，在該市，赤崁樓舉行鄭成功史料展覽會，這將是光復以後首次的展覽會將國姓爺之史料，書畫，照片，刻板，文獻傳記等五十餘種，全部搜羅陳列。又市府為保存史跡起見，赤崁樓內歷史館，即將開工傷理。前白部長蒞台時，曾捐款以保存此史蹟。據卓高煊氏告記者稱：此次台南紀念歷史館成立週年紀念，曾徵集先賢鄭成功史料文獻及明淸兩朝其他史料，迄今仍繼續徵集中，連同原有明淸史料，約有六十餘件。其中如赤崁城，赤崁樓，延平郡王祠，開元寺等，均為歷史勝康，甚有瞻仰價値。</p>
<p>赤崁樓在台南市民族路。明永曆四年荷蘭人建立稱為紅毛城。西歷一六二二年鄭成功驅逐荷蘭人改稱承天府，併施蕃政後，一度充作日陸車衛戍病院及合南師範學校。民國十年，日人羽鳥市長復撥巨款修葺。</p>

<h3>威爾斯的前期與後期</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>自「世界史鋼」與「生命的科學」譯成中文（均商務版），戚爾斯才普遍的被國內的一般讀者所知道。他早年的創作，以科學理想爲重心，在國際間負有盛望。雖然文學史家給那所謂「科學故事」之上安上一惆「Pseudo」的評語，然而有許多方面，目前超出了理想之外，已近於實騐的地步了。</p>
<p>郎格（Long英國文學史作者）氏對於他早年的寫作，會這樣下評語說：</p>
<p>「赫伯脫G.威爾斯是一位誠　，對藝術的態度很嚴肅的作家，在同時代許多寫實份子之中，算是非常卓越的一個。他會聲言；我們要將生命的全部作爲寫述的題材。我們要進而討論社會，政治，宗敎多方而的問題，直待在一種冷寂的態度之中，閘明那千萬數表面的虛套爲止。</p>
<p>「從此等題材討論所發出的糾紛，』，郎格氏帶些嘲諷的樣子批評著，「那簡直有一萬一千個，即　最善於斷案的古希伯萊王所羅門，也不免要菗住自己的舌頭哩。那些問題在威爾斯先生方面，都成了他的任務和使用的工其，總之，成爾斯的使命是改革，工具是小說，眞有些像古代的英雄驅逐什麼魔鬼似的。我們對於他這種救力與勇茁的信心，表示讚美。他從宗敎，社曾，政治方面所看出來的不眞　，比加來爾所計算的還要多，—簡直無處不「濛混不淸，」從每一個濛混不淸的問題上，他必得出一本書。所以，他不僅是一個說故事的人，同時，他那二三十部小說的主要意旨，一部份是屬於科學理想；——用那貌似的題材，來建塑凡爾（J.Verne）或莫亞（More）式的烏托邦。隨後，他出了一本嚮亮的書「約亞與彼特」，竟顯明地描繪着歐洲一切將步入第一次大戰的前程；其實，他是在肆性攻擎現代敎育</p>
<p>『和其旁的改革派作家一樣，威爾斯有他的特點和弱點。他的特點是很嫻熟社會學與科學，他不能實用，却拿來頌揚上帝。他的弱點呢，却是在他的此等作品之中，所描寫的人，非常缺乏　魂與人性。在「結婚」的一篇之中，他將他描寫的男女英雄，離開城市放在一個小茅屋當中，而且證實此美麗而簡單的農家生活是怎樣可能。其實，一個人住在荒凉的海岸旁，較之住在一處華美的大邸中，生活是尤複雜，而且很少有安全的。』郎格認爲「簡單與單純決不是由研究科學和以捕魚作餐的生活便能形成；它出自人的天性品質，而且所謂生活與意識錯綜複雜，也未見得就由於城市生活的結果。』</p>
<p>『總而言之，』郎格氏覺得「威爾斯那般屈就着討論改革社會的缺陷，而其實却將那些問題中問優良的部份部失掉。如「新瑪雪威利」一書，只是表現作者在怎樣誠懇地計發那些虛假面目龍了。雖然如此，他總還算得一個好作家，有力量而且誠摯，但一般的缺點還是過於缺少說故事的態度。他的一篇最成功的作品「時運之輪」，卻是不合以上缺點的。」</p>
<p>中年以後，威爾斯的文藝作品漸稀少了，　「未來世界」，與其當爲故事，不如認作報道什麼的。在藝術上着眼，我以爲郎格的意見還公允，但他那科學的題材，無論怎樣「像煞有介事」，却較之那些不負責的態度要進步要眞實，而且可列在童話以上的格位，作爲少年們的讀物，以培植他們愛好科學的趣味。我以　威爾斯光生從科學的力量找不　至大面可實現的結論之後，和離本務新，而轉入社會政治問題吧——這些間題，固不應如郎絡氏所說那般：迎所羅門也當幕住他的嘴，其實也未嘗不可一談，只要從可能的方而着眼。像他的「示來世界」，就已公　是一部成功的書，一本預言，一個國際間良好的示範。國際間如果眞能照他的理想作，又何患第三次大戰。我們只怕把威爾斯先生看得太理想；他並不超越現實。他所示的條目，只看國際間的和平事業家願不願意做。我顧他的遺志得能實現。</p>
<p>威爾斯是偉大的，似乎比一切廿世紀作家都偉大，如果推開藝術兩個字的話。</p>
<h3>上海文藝作家協會成立紀念冊序</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>民國三十六年五月四日，上海文藝作家協會正式成立：這是一件可喜可賀的事！在封建時代，京師往往是文化中心：執政者，爲了鞏固自己的地位，他們儘量吸收人才：從這些人才所努力而產生的文化，必然是淸一色的御用文化。到了後來，人權昌明，人類尊嚴昂然抬頭，文化不再以個人爲中心，——即使量從若干大師，乃是自主的，理智的，不活功利主義的，——而以自己所造成的物質文明爲轉移，所以各大都會成了文化中心：這是民主時代應有的現象。</p>
<p>上海也就在這種條件之下，成爲全國文化中心。</p>
<p>可是，根據前清道光二十二年（公元一八四二）的「江寧條約」，上海被開放爲通商口埠。名義上僅是「通商」，事實上淪爲半殖民地：租界等設施，侮辱我們的民族尊嚴。在這樣的環境裏所產生的文化，必然是半殖民地的文化，就是說拜金媚外，低級趣味的奴性文化。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰，中國以血肉的代價，爭得了國際平等地位。賢明的友邦取消了束縛中國的不平等條約。於是上海從名義上的中國疆土復原爲實際上的中國疆土。但是，眞正的中國本位文化尙須建設。</p>
<p>在這全國文化中心的上海，在這偶空前的文化建設中，上海文藝作家無疑的應該負起偉大艱鉅的責任，因爲文藝是人類感情的敎育，靈魂的耙錄，也就是文化的精華。</p>
<p>於上海文藝作家協會成立以前，上海不是沒有類似的文藝團體；於上海文藝作家協會成立以後，也可能再有相近的文藝組織誕生。對於前者，我們誠摯地祝她們健存；對於後者，我們衷心祈禱她們繁殖；然而，對於這新生的上海文藝作家協會，我們確乎寄以最熱烈的希望，承前後，希望團結上海文藝作家於一起。</p>
<p>文藝的疆域猶如一座大花園。專門栽種某一種花，即使是名花，可以盛極一時；—無奈「盛極」不過「一時」而已！必須各種花卉　爲配置，於是一年四季都有花可以欣賞，並且可以比較。</p>
<p>文藝的路又是康莊大道。人人可走，人人可以「同時」走。誰珨使的勁來得大，誰便走得快，誰便走得遠。誰走得慢，或立停了不走，甚至掉頭向後轉，他們所獲的必然是退步或沒落。至於自己不努力，却妄想攔住他人前進，是決不會成功的！</p>
<p>上海文藝作家協會在成立大會官言」裏所揭示的宗旨，在乎「作」，在乎「協」。它要改革文藝界目前破碎支離各自爲政的局面，要掃除門戶之見，要團結忠於文藝的朋友們，要求文藝界的朋友們一致參加，互助合作；進而爭取人類的尊嚴，爭取智彗的崇敬，爭取思想的自由：這種種，目光之遠大，胸襟之寬廣，當爲以前所未有。循此做去，一定能夠鋎　成上述的建設工程。</p>
<p>我相信上海文藝作家協會同人決然是開明的，樂觀的，積極的。雖然有無數物質上的和精神上的困難窺伺着我們，然而人類一切的困難是人類自己造成的，克服這些困難，正是我們的責任。個人很願追隨上海文藝界諸君之後，共同策勵，共同努力，來發揚我們建國途程中的上海的文藝事業！</p>
<h3>黃昏的歌</h3>
<p>— 老凱</p>
<p>當黃昏滑落古銅色的睡衣，姻熏也舒散開她的乳色的絹帶，圍繞着森林，拖蓋住山谷和原野的碧綠的胸膛。——一切都是如此的迷濛，連漫步在空闊的歸途底白色　羣，都無法辨認得出。</p>
<p>然而，一切又都是如此的悠然。</p>
<p>淺沼的怒蛙，短竹業的麻雀，驀地停歇了，孩子似的喧鬧與老太婆似的絮絮聒聒。</p>
<p>敎堂的鐘，似乎失去了它以前的抑揚的洪嚮。</p>
<p>溪流：有的吐出讚美的低語，有的則伸直她那細長而又潔凈的臂膀，載負了這銀玲的淸越與珠輪的滾轉。</p>
<p>野草，在歡地在晚風裏舞蹈，最初的羞怯的星星也睜開秀眼，從蒼白的雲堆探首下視。</p>
<p>搖曳着的垂柳，在堤畔，遍插起歡迎的旂子。</p>
<p>崖邊，有綿密的杉樹林，感動地頻頻點頭。</p>
<p>甚至，沉默的遠峯，都意外地在蔚藍中調上一點落體所餽贈給它的粉紅，而洩出一種忍抑不住的莊嚴的喜悅。</p>
<p>歌，如同海燕，期翔于碧藍無際的晴空。歌，如同野馬，奔駛于瀰渙着泥土芬芳的廣漠的草原。</p>
<p>這美麗的歌喲，在天之下，地之上，創造了一個絢爛無比的幻想的世界。</p>
<p>她播送出雄雄奇的激嚮，使生命爲之跳躍；她又迸發出悽惋的淸音，使感情向她扯起白旂，使感情震顫在她底膝下。</p>
<p>在這恬靜的富于詩意的黃巷，她瘋在地漫空漫野，飛揚着愛情的柔絲，霸縛住每固年靑的人，和年靑的心，漂泊的遊子，必要爲她停留一下　忽的行脚；奔走風塵的旅客，也時而在她的慰撫下，抖落一身的疲勞。</p>
<p>傾聽呵，傾聽着這一支美麗的歌。</p>
<p>她可以以打開我們靈魂扉，喚回那些歡愉的夢景，而凈化那些頹廢的感情，和哀傷的記憶。</p>
<p>一切都是如此的迷濛，一切又都是如此的悠然。</p>
<p>唱在黃昏的歌，彷徘是不可捉摸的氣和霧中的生靈哩！</p>
<h3>仲夏夜之夢</h3>
<p>— 王德雲</p>
<p>裝飾</p>
<p>金色的曙光裝飾了黎明；銀白的雲朶裝飾了盡午；紫紅的晚護裝飾了黃昏，暗藍的星星裝飾了夜晚。</p>
<p>生命裝飾了大地；鮮花裝飾了少女；「明月裝飾了你的窗子；」——你呀，你裝飾了我的夢。</p>
<p>七月</p>
<p>七月的星空，帶來了我底美麗的仲夏夜之夢。</p>
<p>那銀色的詩的日子，那竇石似的星星，那對瑩澈的眸子，那種柔情的悄語……一連串的藍色的夢的記憶喲。</p>
<p>在那琴韻和蛙歌交織的繁嚮裏，在你的眼波和天上的羣星閃鑠成一片時，我的口哨響鄕起了，在長靑的矮綠樹邊，我們追捕明　的流螢……</p>
<p>而今，七月的星空依舊是美麗的，我却空懷着一顆破碎的心，昏囈着無比旖旎的舊夢！</p>
<p>戀歌</p>
<p>戀歌是熱情的飛迸，苦悶的泛濫。</p>
<p>以你的滿腔哀怨，盡情地歌唱吧，唱出你的不幸，你的希望，也唱出你的夢</p>
<p>便縱沒有彈琴的女孩在你身邊，你還是可以唱的，請將你的頭抖的心弦奏起，唱出你的孤寂的，妻惶的，火熱的戀歌。</p>
<p>如果夜風多情，它會將你的歌聲帶到那迢遙的地方去呵。</p>

<h3>梅</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血336</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>在這四十多小時內，除了稍稍休息之外，我用最大部分的時間，守候在丁君的床邊，希望他能淸醒這麼一半小時，或幾分鐘，但始終沒有獲到這最後的一綫機會。同時，我也借辭到幾個拘禁所裏，探索其他被捉的幾位同志，也同徐君又接觸過一兩次，却始終探尋不到耀羣和小老虎的踪跡。很明顯的一點，被拘禁的同志中，就沒有女性。</p>
<p>到僞警總局去探聽，據說當時倭憲兵部，確會捉獲過兩名女間謀，至於囚在什麼所在，可不知道。關於小老虎，也是倭憲兵部的指令，說有這麼一個又像老人又像兒童的魔術傢伙，能用邪法殺人，被他殺死的日本憲兵有三四名之多，連傷痕部騐不出來；一定要僞限期捕　。僞警無法，管他是人是妖，連影子都沒見到過，上哪裏去捉人？所以只好用「懸賞」方法，敷衍日人。</p>
<p>我在天津忙亂了頭尾三天，可說毫無成績。倭特工和憲兵部把這問破獲秘密機關的事，視爲莫大功勞，憑我這點地位勢力，要想援救被拘同志正如上海人的口氣：「談也勿要談起」。別說我，就是鶴見親來，怕也無法；因這裏特工，乃是松字部下，我們沒有內綫，做不出手脚來。</p>
<p>就在這天晚上（七日），我收到W君密電，說已經得到耀羣消息，呌我最好設法儘速回轉北平。我想暫時我雖不能把被拘的同志們援救出來，至少也得　他們减少些痛苦。在匆忙碌亂中，我佈置了兩件事：一，弄了一筆款子，一半委託給執行管理的倭憲，呌他儘優待遇這幾個人，吿訴他這是行動總部的授意，不能違拗。同時把其餘的款子分散給幾位同志，讓他們手頭方便些。第二，我臨走時候，裝作很嚴重的姿態，同松部駐津的那個首腦，談了幾句話，示意給他：「這幾名要犯，綫索很多，參謀籃部接到我的報吿，必要利用他們一番」。有了這幾句話，那傢伙絕對不敢再任意苛刑磨折他們了。</p>
<p>趕回北平，W君給我一封電報利一份報吿。電報是耀羣七月三日由津發出，六日才遞到，雖說是電報，却比郵件包裏還慢；已由密碼，譯成明文：</p>
<p>過津適問秘站被襲，正設法營救，實力不足，難期收效，請速增援。二日內如無辦法，難將　　，因張　尙有　　勾當。釋</p>
<h3>漲風與房荒</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>生活幾乎時時刻刻受着威脅，我們只聽見一片「調整」「漲整」的聲音，什麼人都在「唉聲嘆氣」。</p>
<p>政府顯然也爲着漲風在担憂，這一星期來市府經監工作人員價騎四出，嚴格禁止黃金美鈔的黑市，陸續剪斷投機市塲的對講電話，這都說明了政府對「消弭漲風」制止「物價浮動」，已採取了緊急的措施。</p>
<p>如若「七月漲風」能够因政府的疏解，而使物價穩定一時，這是一般人　香以求的。</p>
<p>但到目前爲止，市府對本市房　租賃問題，迄未作硬性的規定，實在令人不解。</p>
<p>我們以爲，房租黑市的存在，一樣是助長漲風的原因之一。</p>
<p>一間小小的　子，房主（其實是二房東）可以索價一二千萬，一幢房子，更是三四千萬不辦，市府對於房荒黑市價格，就任其如此囂張，如此狂妄麼？</p>
<p>爲了消弭「漲風」，市府應會同地方人士，商討一房荒補救辦法，最少應嚴密調查全市空屋，硬性規定租賃條例，必要時，應由市府派員强制執行！</p>
<p>上海房屋的金條惡例，完全是上海「二房東」創造的破壞法律的行爲，我們要求市府以最嚴厲的法律，來擊破這一條上海人爲的「金條堡壘」！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>抗戰序幕</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>第一發侵略的子彈，是在七月七日的深夜，幾乎可以說是已經進入了八日的淸晨。江南人知道這個消息，是讀到九日報紙的時候了。在這個時候以前，抵抗侵略的歌曲，已經響遍了全國。誰都預料到我們總有一天會站起來阻擋敵人，並且將他們逐出東北的。然而這第一顆子彈在最初的一剎那並沒有予人那樣的感覺。我們默然地吞下太多的侮辱了。也許這顆子彈還得吞下去吧。</p>
<p>果此後數日，當局然用外交對付軍事，未到最後關頭，決不放棄和平。中央廣播電台放送着越王勾踐的故事。民衆要求起來驅逐吳國的駐軍，越王總是說還早，還早。當時的靑年比越國人民還要急切。運老年人也認爲不能再忍了，抗戰的歌聲，響激了雲霄，可是外交還在進行之中。</p>
<p>敵人以爲這是九一八的Encore（再來一個），睡手可以義括華北。唯有旁觀者淸，歐美人開始警吿日本，不要彎弓過强。中國已非昔日之中國，此時廬山正在召集會議。對於敵人侵略的砲聲，有如沒有回童的空谷，於是敵人越玩越放手了。也許是彷彿一條響尾蛇，它已經出擊、沒有縮回的餘地。到了七月中旬，從廬山才傳出了中央的聲音。是由緩慢的節拍而逐漸加速，由低沉而逐漸高昂。它與老百姓的呼聲逐漸配合起來，而領導了老百姓，形成一個民族抗戰的大合唱</p>
<p>眞正的抗戰的序幕，於是緩緩地揭了開來。</p>
<h3>美蔬菜大王</h3>
<p>— 永年</p>
<p>讀者大槪都曉得美國有煤油大王鋼鐵大王等大實業家，今介紹一個經營美國蔬菜業，堪稱爲蔬菜大王名弗萊特華爾辛（Fred　Vahlsing）的給諸位知道。</p>
<p>據說每個美國人無論他住在美國那一處，他所吃的蔬菜大多是華爾辛所種植的。現今華爾辛所占有的田地遍及美國六個州，在泰克賽司（Texas）州的一片菜圃，就占地一萬畝，可說是全世界最大的。那裏種有五百畝的芹菜；一千五百畝的廿藍及三千畝的胡蘿葡。他用數百輛的卡車，拖車以及飛機來播種或收穫，有一次他爲工作人員定製的工裝就有五百噸之重。他對於殺蟲劑　，氣候，各地貨車運費等等，有關他出產物之培植及轉遝的知識非常豐富。他簡直像部活的百科全書，有時業務上須他親自出馬時，即乘他自備的雙引擊飛機趕到目的池。</p>
<p>他十二歲開始就經營羅菜業，那時在長島地方他父親的菜園裏，載菜往紐約城輿出售，每天做十二塊錢的賣買，並代鄰居脫售蔬菜，做　客的生意。後來他把辛勤積蓄得來的一萬元，外加五磅的甘監種子，交給他的知友奇斯，在南方炎熱的泰克塞司州，賣下二百畝荒地，開始種植北部自十一月至來春菜市上絕跡的甘藍。一九二七年的冬季，他首次將甘藍運至級約城，引起了大衆的注意，菜館子競相列人菜單中，他漸以擴充田地至數千畝，他想在同處種王蜀黍。當地農民警吿他，稱該地有特種害蟲，會吃光所種的玉蜀黍。但他證：「這總有方法對付的。」他遵照專家的指示，雇用工人五百，以殺蟲劑與重油混合物，酒滴在每一叢玉蜀黍的穗上，數星期後，他竟然豐收了大量的冬季玉蜀黍。</p>
<p>後來他計劃在美國東部種馬鈴　，於是買下一大塊被人公認爲毫無價値的多沼濕地，努力經營起來，用起土機開掘幾里長的溝，舖下導水管；因多害蟲，須用飛機洒佈DDT，又在田地附近舖着很長的多孔鋼板席，作飛機之起落塲。數月後，他每畝的田地收檴到七噸的馬鈴著！比他人最高之出產量每畝多二噸！</p>
<p>華爾辛的目標，是尋找新的方法，使蔬菜自園地到達廚房，又快又康，這也就是他成功的秘決。</p>
<h3>忍住眼淚說笑話</h3>
<p>— 陳葉</p>
<p>今日的雜誌編者們多有求稿難之感，要出類拔萃的文稿則更覺困難。我想這裏而最大的原因便是目前破碎的時代所加之於每個人心靈上的巨大壓力，使得多數人都無法有舒展的心情。今日的生活大難，文人是最感應付爲難的一個。但是文稿之受人歡迎者決非訴苦，人們之生活愈苦，則愈要求報章文字的輕鬆，所以報紙雜誌都要美麗的小品，旁微博引的考述，旅行生活等等。作者們固有不爲稿酬而屬文的，但生活悲慘的亦紙得寫寫「拿破崙的戀愛生活」云，轉覺忍住眼淚說笑話，背後誰知道藏藏着多少悲哀呢。</p>
<h3>談相知</h3>
<p>— 建康</p>
<p>「相識滿天下，相知有幾人！」不少交遊甚廣的朋友，一旦功敗垂成，就不免要這樣慨然喟嘆了。</p>
<p>我曾經想過—爲什麼「相識滿天下」，而又「相知」無「幾人」呢？莫非世人個個都是壞蛋，迎自己在內，也都不能與人相知，不願與人相知嗎？</p>
<p>現在，我獲得一個膚淺的解釋了：</p>
<p>第一，因爲我們之間，交遊往往不能盡如人意。譬如說；你我倆一見面，首先不兔寒喧幾句，在此之前，或則由於旁人介紹：或則一邊遞送名刺，一邊引見；或則「尊姓」？「合甫是是…」彼此一問一答，從山謀取相繼。原來曉得籍貫·職業的還好，否則，中國人的習慣，接着便是「府上那裏？」「在什麼貴處得意？」好了，道不同不相爲謀，我正從事於建築工程，你幹的敎育事業，我在行政機關服務，你却在金融界裏涵跡；假使你是滿口廣東客家話，我是從未出夔門的四川人，試問我們怎麼　相知？還不是「久仰，久仰！」「哈，哈哈，哈！」從此完結。</p>
<p>這是說，交識以外，加上職業與語言上的隔閡，以致不易相知，不能相知。</p>
<p>第二，退一步講，假使天假良　，你我倆以不同的鄕籍，原來各殊的職業，由於偶然的撮合，居然同在一個機麗做事，甚至朝夕相見或三兩天有碰面談笑的機會，可是，你也許高據要津，我只當個佐理人員之流，或者，我主管某一部份，你却担任另一部份的普通職務，在業務上，在生活上，以及其他方面，我們之間，彷彿無從也無須互相關切；同樣的，假定你我職務位置相埒，可是，因爲工作興趣，你忙忙碌碌於外勤部門，我却孜孜元元在內勤方面，我們彼此雖尚不相惡，但又能怎樣由接近而談得相知呢？</p>
<p>這可以說是有緣而綠不深；萬一不久以後，你我中的任何一個，突然調差或離職了，那眞是與無綠差不多，因爲你我　還相歲不久，相知又從何談起！</p>
<p>除此之外，要是你我的性格　，脾胃，待人接物的方式，以至習慣，嗜好……發現有較大的差別，甚至格格不入，則相知之難，更不待言了！</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐茲園</p>
<p>房荒嚴重，解決有道</p>
<p>戰後整個世界在鬧着房荒，美國並不例外，但有些國家顯得特別嚴重，中國就是實例·有些國家趨乎平淡，美國是一個例，美國沒有敢囤積居奇的人，更沒有敢把房屋囤積居奇的人，當局隨時派員調查每戶人口及所佔房屋，如果房屋間數超過需要，政府有權勒令租出，而且租金是由政府規定的，視坐落地點，面積大小，房屋新舊，設備情况，平均每間臥室連傢具被褥水電，每月租金在美金三十元左右，一經政府佔定租金，以後即照此支付，不得多索一文，如有需素，房客可報吿統制局請房東吃官司。</p>
<p>此外有許多公益機關專門代市民物色住所，辦理此種業務的有紅十字會，勞軍委員會USO，各軍事學校各部隊各飛機塲均設有Housing　Office爲駐軍眷屬解決房荒問題·他們經常派人在各住宅區徵求餘屋出租，美國地主大抵對無枝可樓者尙具相當同情，亟願把餘屋騰出來租給軍人眷屬，決無抬高租金，大敲竹槓之事，頂費是聞所朱聞的，也沒有光付租金一年之例，沒有行李的先付後住，有行李的先住後付。</p>
<p>美國人搬家非常簡便，祇有衣箱數事，傢具舖蓋向由房東供給，這對於旅行的家庭非常方便，甚至面巾，浴巾，碗蓋，也由房東供給，你要房東家搭伙，也可商量，不然的話，除自備伙食或進餐館外，另有一種專辦伙食的家庭Boarding　house，規定進膳時間，到時你祇管進去坐席，吃完付綫就是了，這種地方完全家廚，烹調甚好，取費極廉，每餐約三角半左右，不相識的顧客，圍坐一張長方桌，男女老少均有，好像一個大家庭，主婦慇勤勸進，化很少的錢，吃很多的菜。這種地方中國人不很願意去，因爲中國人購究虛榮，寗可化一元七角五吃半生不熟的煎牛排，咬落大牙。辦伙食的家庭普通都有房間出租，但因爲租金較低，不易找到空缺。（十二）</p>
<h3>新聞剪輯</h3>
<p>— 小座輯</p>
<p>江西寗都米價日漲，連乞丐生活也難以維持，當地乞丐頭目曾金蘭，沿街鳴鑼呼號，籲請政府禁止米糧出境，並大呌「救命」，一呼百應·數百貧民靈集街頭·大聲助威。是晚，有宏業米莊老　楊吉生裝米三大軍，運往贛縣出售，被貧民用石將軍門擊破，戇擁登軍，頃刻間把米一搶而盡。</p>
<p>湖南武岡縣南門外鍾家坪右位老太太蕭曾氏，現年一百二十八歲，會生有四子六女。現僅留二女，年亦在八十以上。因家境貧困，全憑十指操勞度日。縣府徐縣長聞悉後，特備白米一石，肥鷄一隻，猪肉二斤，被褥一套，邀同黨團首長親往餽送。徐縣長到達該地時，這位老太太正桃了八十多斤的水担回家，見大　貴客光臨，連呼好大老爺不止。</p>
<p>隴海鐵路管理局一個姓王的小職員，在路局已服務了二十多年，近呈請路局將他的撫卹金提前支給，以便維持一家大小，不致斷炊。至於身後事，在這糊口不遑的情形之下，也顧不得許多了。</p>
<p>蘇州城防指揮部發明了一個禁賭的新方法：</p>
<p>「如發現有賭博情事，一經拘部審訊屬實後，處以站立木籠，並將木籠置於觀前街熱鬧地點，罰其站立二小時以儆。』</p>
<p>南京禁政機關，向內政部　察總署撥用警犬三十頭，專門担任姻毒查緝工作。該項警犬購自美國，受過特殊訓練，能在一公里外嗅出姻味，循氣味搜索，遏到身染姻味的人，便緊咬不放，百無一失。</p>
<p>雲南彌勒縣復興鎭中心小學校，近因生活程度高漲，校中經費不敷甚鉅，異想天開，竟在校中擺設賭堪，從中取利，以彌補學校經費。該校敎職員每日站立睹塲左右，招徠主顧。</p>
<p>江西樂平人汪樹藩，爲已故國會議員在鶴齡獨子，現年二十三歲，體重三百四十八市斤，素有胖子大王之稱，行路遲緩，坐必喘氣，稍久坐即巷然入睡，每月須由醫院抽血爾次，以訪中風。近因聞南昌有「詊子大會」的組織，乃於日前由其　屬陪同來省觀光。南昌「　子大會」以該「胖子大王」來省機會　　，定期舉行歡迎會，籍賣互相觀擊。</p>

<h3>天才數學家華羅庚</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>十幾年前的一個夏天，我在蟬聲蛙鼓之中初次走進了美麗的淸華園。一切都是新奇的；連來來往往的人也是奇奇怪怪的。響如說，有一位穿一件半新舊藍布大掛的老先生，手裏提着一個布包袱，滿在在乎的從圖書館寡進進出出—誰知道這就是世界聞名的陳寅格先生！有一位胖胖的先生，一條腿已經鋸去了，緊緊扶着兩根拐杖，可是上下樓梯，來去如飛：這就是潘光旦先生一</p>
<p>然而，最使我永誌不忘的，却是在一天探夜，月色如水，把整個園子浸在更淸凉的境界中了，凉風過處，帶來了陣陣蟬聲蛙鼓—我忽然聽見有人在朗朗的謹證白朗寗的詩篇。從樹蔭後面繞到溪畔，我看見有一個卅左右的靑年人坐在白石的橋欄上，短短的「平頂」頭髮，黑邊的眼鏡，淸權而帶一點憔悴，正在望月吟詩。</p>
<p>我們攝着脚步走開了，我的朋友悄悄吿訴我：「這是數學系的華維庚—一個了不起的人」！</p>
<p>回頭再看時，他也許已經覺得有人窺探，立起身來，一跛一跛的很吃力的走向後面去了。</p>
<p>之後，我就常常看見他，我知道了他是金壇人，沒有進過大學，可是他的刻苦自學，使他在數學上已有驚人的造詣，他的論文常常發表在外國的數學雜誌士，得到了極高的評價。那時，外國的數學界名宿在淸華講學的，有法國的哈達瑪（國際數學會的會長）和美國的溫訥，全北平各大學的數學敎授和研究員都來聽能們演講。但是，這些敎授和研究生們後來到得愈來愈少—最後，據說就祗有華羅庚一個人靜靜地坐在台下，和台上眉飛色舞的哈達瑪「對壘」。消息獲通的同學們到處傳佈，說哈達瑪對華羅庚傾倒備至，口口聲稱他「華敎授」，而事實上華先生那時的名義還祗是「敎員」。</p>
<p>大家都說：華光生該出國了，而且，大家都猜到，他出國之後的成就是一定更要震驚世界的。</p>
<p>那時，華北的風雲正是最緊急的時候，北平的學生發動了轟轟烈烈的大遊行，面對着滿面殺氣的日本憲兵，呌出了「打倒日本帝國主義」的口號。</p>
<p>華先生是不良於行的，但是在某一次示威中，學生們汲現了他正在行列的前面！看見了他的影子，最懦弱的學生們也立刻加入了這浩浩蕩蕩的悲愼而憤怒的隊伍！</p>
<p>勝利了，華先生果然到了國外。無論是美國，是蘇聯，都把無數最高的榮冠加到了他的頭上。國內的學術機關爭着　他，但是他又飄然到了美國。最近，聽說他已經在洽　他的病　了。</p>
<p>山　水長—　敢說中國人不如人家？隴敢說中國沒有希望！</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Radio Address on the Tenth Anniversary of the July 7th Resistance, Announcing to the Entire Nation: Arousing Insight into Treacherous Schemes, Rising Up to Suppress the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Chairman Chiang, on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the July 7th Resistance, broadcast to the nation. The original text is as follows: Fellow countrymen across the nation, today is the tenth anniversary of our July 7th Resistance. I feel it is necessary to solemnly explain to all my fellow countrymen the changes in our national situation since the victory of the Resistance, the entire crisis of the nation, and the key to the blessings, misfortunes, and interests of our fellow countrymen. Our goal in resisting Japan was to defend our territory, recover the Northeast, and maintain the integrity of our sovereignty and territory. If the sovereignty and administrative control of the Northeast are not restored for even a single day, then the goal of the Resistance has not been achieved. The heroic souls of the millions of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves for the Resistance will have no way to be comforted. This is entirely the common responsibility of us who survive. Everyone knows that before Japan surrendered, there were no Communist bandit troops in the Northeast. When the National Army entered the Northeast to receive and administer sovereignty, in that year and a half, the Communist bandits launched five offensives against the National Army, besieging the areas the government had already received, cutting up the Northeast's land, and slaughtering the Northeast's people. Recently, the Communist Party's response to the People's Political Council's peace proposals was first to use its propaganda organs to slander and smear, followed by launching frantic offensives inside and outside the customs as a de facto response. In particular, their offensive in the Northeast this time was of unprecedented scale. Since early May, they have launched more than 300,000 troops to launch fierce attacks on various important strongholds, and finally concentrated the focus of the attack on Siping Street, using ten times the strength of the defending troops to launch eighteen days and nights of fierce attacks. Finally, relying on the spirit of our soldiers continuing the resistance against Japan, they dealt a crushing blow to the invading Communist bandits, shattering their attempt to encircle Changchun and Jilin, seize Shenyang, and enabling the Northeast war situation to reach a turning point for success or failure. However, the Communist bandits' consistent conspiracy to destroy the motherland will never stop there, so the crisis in the Northeast cannot be said to be fundamentally resolved by the victory in Siping Street. How the Communist bandits entered the Northeast and how the troops they joined in the rebellion in the Northeast were organized is all well known and obvious. The Communist Party is inheriting the mantle of the imperialist Japan and the puppet Manchurian traitors. They are implementing the poisonous scheme left behind by the imperialist Japan's failure to completely destroy China, not allowing our Chinese nation to restore sovereignty in the Northeast, not allowing our Republic of China to enjoy territorial and administrative integrity, and even today they are still using the remaining troops of our enemy, Japan, leading them to trample on our Chinese land and harm our Chinese people. The Communist bandits' perverse and insane actions are more brutal than any bandit in history, and their intentions are more vicious than any traitor or puppet in Chinese history. Fellow countrymen must know that the Communist Party's military rebellion is to split our entire China and destroy our entire nation. They must make our national spirit and inherent morality diminish completely, so that we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will forever be reduced to slaves and cattle, unable to maintain independent and free personalities. If we allow the Communist bandits' destructive and inhumane bestiality to continue to exist, then we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, will suffer the same collective slaughter, collective exile, and eternal enslavement as the recently subjugated nations.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party's Treacherous Heart Does Not Awaken from Persuasion</h3>
<p>The purpose of our National Revolution is to establish an independent, free, and democratic New China based on the Three Principles of the People, and the work of national construction must be premised on the peaceful unification of the country. But peace and unification are inseparable, unification and democracy and freedom are inseparable, and unification and the people's happiness are even more inseparable. If the country cannot be unified, then all national construction ideals will become empty talk, and the people's rights and livelihood cannot be realized. The people cannot obtain a standard of living above a basic level when they are trampled upon locally, their economy is divided, production is destroyed, and transportation is cut off. Compatriots must be able to recall that "The war has just ended, and internal strife cannot be allowed to exist again." This was my sincere cry to the Communist Party after the victory. Any responsible government and any patriotic people do not want to cause the country and the people to fall into the suffering of war again after the scars left by the war. We do not want to deny that communism has become a doctrine or ideology. At that time, we only hoped that the Communist Party would follow the path of democracy, like the communist parties in democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, and win voters through peaceful and legal political parties. Therefore, for ten years, especially in the past year or more, the government has always been painstakingly tolerant and compromising, only hoping that the Communist Party would not undermine unification, not maintain troops to divide the country, not overthrow the foundations of the country, and not constantly harm the people's lives. The government could consider accommodating their opinions if they worked together for peaceful and democratic construction. However, no amount of negotiation, agreement, or mediation can eliminate their treacherous hearts, and no amount of negotiation can awaken them to the future of the country and the suffering of the people's livelihood. The main actions of the Communist bandit troops for more than a year have been concentrated on destroying transportation, destroying industry and mining, and destroying the dying rural areas everywhere. Every time the government calls for peace and every time it issues a ceasefire order, it only encourages the Communist bandit troops to expand and attack further, only increases the difficulties of the National Army's front lines, only increases the sacrifices of loyal soldiers and the people, and only expands the banditry and prolongs the war, making the work of social recovery and reconstruction after the war more difficult than ever before. Now, my fellow countrymen across the country can clearly recognize that the Communist Party has a "bandit nature that is difficult to change," has absolutely no sincerity in repenting, and is determined to rebel to the end. Their ambition and conspiracy will not stop until they destroy the country and harm the world. If we cannot unite as a country, discern treacherous schemes, and be determined to suppress the rebellion, then not only will the people's livelihood become increasingly desolate, but the entire country will also be divided and destroyed by them.</p>
<h3>Today's Indifference Means Tomorrow's Helplessness</h3>
<p>The Communist Party's open rebellion after the end of the War of Resistance was originally a conspiracy they had already determined. When we won the War of Resistance, they openly launched their so-called "joining the army movement" and "social struggle," "mass liquidation" in the bandit areas, using violence and coercion, specializing in cruel killings to establish prestige, from old women to young children, not allowing a single grain or a single piece of cloth to be retained, and every blade of grass and every tree was robbed, for their rebellious violence. All able-bodied men in the bandit areas had no way to survive unless they followed them as bandits. Any slight resistance would result in being sliced to death and buried alive, implementing their so-called "death to the whole family for one deserter." Tens of thousands of fellow countrymen in the bandit areas were driven by the Communist bandits in this way, becoming the victims of their rebellion and harming the people.</p>
<p>However, in our rear areas, especially in the major cities of Central and South China, there are still many people who do not recognize the fundamental crisis of the country and the nation, do not see clearly the Communist Party's extremely vicious atrocities, or hope for luck and tolerate them, or live in ease and comfort, not knowing that our fellow countrymen in the rear can still maintain their regular way of life entirely because of the National Army soldiers who are sacrificing themselves to suppress bandits and save the people, fighting and resisting on the front lines. Otherwise, they would have already fallen into the same tragic situation as the people in the Communist areas of North and Northeast China. Therefore, if we weaken the National Army today, we are shaking the basic right to survival of the people of the whole country. Precisely because our fellow countrymen in the rear cannot clearly see the facts of this disaster, blessing, and interest, the Communist bandits use the psychology of ease and comfort and blind tolerance in society to instruct their reactionary tools to put forward various slogans such as "opposing grain requisition," "opposing conscription," and "opposing civil war" to reverse black and white, numb people's hearts, confuse society, and shake the foundations of the country, so that our human, material, and even spiritual strength cannot be concentrated and applied to the work of suppressing bandits and construction. Sitting idly by and watching the Communist bandits' violence grow and the rebellion spread, tracing back to the source, it must be said that our social figures have been poisoned by the Communist bandits' counter-propaganda. It must be known that in order to carry out their conspiracy to betray the country and the nation, the Communist bandits must first block our fellow countrymen's ears and eyes and numb our fellow countrymen's conscience. The Communist bandits' purpose is to make my fellow countrymen completely ignorant of national righteousness, regard the country's peril as nothing, and even be ignorant of their own blessings, misfortunes, and permanent interests, thereby losing their confidence in self-improvement, self-reliance, and independence, and becoming spiritual prisoners of the Communist bandits in an invisible way. The state of麻痹in society today, where right and wrong are indistinguishable and interests are not distinguished, is exactly what the Communist bandits want to create. This is just like the ancient saying that swallows nest under dangerous curtains, but do not know their danger. In fact, when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. Fellow countrymen, today's indifference means tomorrow's helplessness. When you are like the fellow countrymen in the bandit areas, you have fallen into a trap, unable to live or die, even if you want to regret it, it is too late. The fate of our country and our fellow countrymen across the country has actually reached such a serious crisis. How can I not fulfill my responsibility to clearly inform and awaken the vigilance of all my fellow countrymen?</p>
<h3>Only Two Roads Ahead: Hoping Fellow Countrymen Will Choose Immediately</h3>
<p>Fellow countrymen must know that now there are only two roads in front of our China. I hope our fellow countrymen will make a choice immediately. One is the road of following old ways and delaying, being indifferent, sitting and waiting for the Communist bandits to slaughter and trample on us, causing the entire country and 450 million fellow countrymen to be destroyed and submerged. The other is the road of facing the facts, recognizing blessings and misfortunes, distinguishing interests, being self-reliant and self-improving, uniting and rising up, eliminating banditry, and saving the country and ourselves. Are we going to unite together and devote all our efforts to suppress the rebellion, maintain the country's territorial sovereignty, complete unification, and achieve the goal of democracy and freedom? Or are we going to sit idly by and watch the bandit troops run rampant, the rebellion spread, our own homes being robbed, our families being humiliated, our children being driven and coerced, becoming tools for traitors, and finally destroying the country's lifeblood? All of our fellow countrymen should think about what kind of days the fellow countrymen who have suffered from banditry in the Northeast and North China are living. In the Northeast, they have experienced more than ten years of subjugation and humiliation, and what the victory has brought is the terror of the Communist bandit troops. Oppression, robbery, slaughter, and the replacement of the violent rule of Japanese imperialism. As for the various parts of North China, they have sacrificed the most and suffered the deepest during the War of Resistance. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the fellow countrymen in many areas had not yet regained their breath when they were invaded by the Communist bandits again and plunged into the abyss of darkness again. Recently, the Communist bandits' offensives in various places have all been with the bandit troops driving their so-called "militia" in front and large carts and mules behind. Wherever the fierce front passes, they rob and loot everything, leaving no chickens or dogs behind, surpassing the enemy's "three alls" policy during the War of Resistance. Whenever the Communist bandits occupy a stronghold, tens of thousands of people have to abandon everything, risk danger, and return to the rear of the National Army's position. The sound of their cries of resentment is the most tragic thing in the world. Our fellow countrymen in the rear are brothers with them, connected by blood. How can we turn a blind eye to their fate? How can we not rush to save them from their disasters? Moreover, the Communist bandits' full-scale rebellion is aimed at destroying the entire China and enslaving all fellow countrymen. If we cannot unite as one to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion, then the inhuman life of the fellow countrymen in the Communist-occupied areas of Northeast and North China today will be a true reflection of the future life of our fellow countrymen in Central and South China.</p>
<h3>Today's Quelling of Rebellion and Suppression of Bandits is Truly Self-Salvation and Self-Defense</h3>
<p>We have not yet completed our recovery, and obstacles are piled up. I deeply know the difficulties in the lives of the general fellow countrymen in our recovered areas, especially the suffering of the farmers in the rural areas is indescribable. But no matter what, compared with the lives of the fellow countrymen in the bandit-stricken areas, who are deprived of their lives, actions, spirits, and materials, and even every breath, every word, and every move is suppressed, and even fathers and sons, husbands and wives must be wary of each other and dare not express their pain, there is a world of difference. It can be seen that today our national soldiers, civilians, and fellow countrymen's quelling of the rebellion and suppression of bandits is not only saving the fellow countrymen in the bandit areas, but it is truly self-salvation and self-defense. If, when the Communist bandits' attempt is so obvious, we still follow old ways and look back, coldly watch, and allow the bandit troops to spread and run rampant, and still cannot be responsible and do our duty to the country and fellow countrymen, and work hard to rise up and curb the rebellion, then we are willingly destroying our own lives and property. Moreover, we have gone through eight years of firm and unyielding resistance, suffered all kinds of hardships, and sacrificed the lives of millions of soldiers and civilians. If we allow the Communist Party's bandit troops to succeed in their malicious conspiracy, their rebellious and harmful ambitions, destroy the glorious history of our national soldiers, civilians, and fellow countrymen's resistance, and carry out the unfinished work of the Japanese imperialists to destroy China, then we ask ourselves, how can we be worthy of our original intention to rise up and resist at that time, and how can we be worthy of the heroic souls of countless martyrs who sacrificed themselves?</p>

<h3>US Begins Review of Our Plans for Using $500 Million Loan; Initial Actions Reveal Traces of Deal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to government officials on the 6th, the Export-Import Bank has begun action on the large number of development plans submitted by China earlier to use the $500 million line of credit. It is said that this plan has been sitting on the desk of the State Department for more than a month. It was only at the beginning of this week that Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun took it to the Export-Import Bank. Ambassador Gu's sending this plan to the Export-Import Bank indicates that there have been new developments in the proposed plan. At least, the bank's general manager, Martin, made a statement beforehand, saying that he would give individual and careful consideration to the plan.</p>
<p>Another part of the government said that the bank has already started action, but it will take a longer period of time before a decision can be made. They explained that in addition to studying each proposal separately, the bank will also generally study China's economic situation. Experts in finance, engineering, law, and general economics will take turns reviewing the plans, and then decide whether to allow the loan. At that time, this plan will be submitted to the National Financial Advisory Council for review. The council is composed of representatives from the Export-Import Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the State Department, and the Department of Commerce. At the same time, officials from the Chinese Embassy in the United States, the China Resources Commission, and the Chinese Supply Mission are on hand to assist and provide information to the Financial Advisory Council when needed.</p>
<p>Informed sources on both the Chinese and American sides said that the Export-Import Bank may give priority to transportation plans, as they best meet the bank's own prerequisites, that is, any new loan must be able to increase export trade. Secondly, attention will be paid to the plans that can best help China become self-reliant.</p>

<h3>Chief of General Staff Chen Informs All Officers and Soldiers: Suppressing Bandits is the Unfinished Responsibility of Revolutionary Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Chen Cheng, Chief of the General Staff, issued a letter to all officers and soldiers for the July 7th Commemoration. The main points are: Although Japan has been defeated today, the Northeast territory and birthright have not been received due to the Communist bandits' obstruction, that is, the goal of the War of Resistance has not been fully achieved, that is, the responsibility of our revolutionary soldiers has not been completed. Now the government is mobilizing the national strength to quell the rebellion, and it is hoped that all comrades across the country will thoroughly implement the policy of suppressing the rebellion in order to save the people in the bandit areas and consolidate national unity. Our central work from now on is all for suppressing bandits and all for victory. Chairman Chiang instructed that the revolution has reached a serious juncture, and it is also a good opportunity for our soldiers to kill enemies and serve the country. We must not hesitate or lose confidence, and we must especially know that the Communist bandits' rebellion is not accidental, but an inevitable encounter in the course of the revolution. Now it has reached the second phase of the National Revolution, and the center of its work is to implement the principle of democracy and the principle of people's livelihood, and its object is to eliminate the obstacles of the Communist bandits' evil forces. Now the revolutionary forces have exceeded all corrupt and evil forces. As long as we earnestly raise our vigilance, victory can be achieved early.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Speech</h3>
<p>We want construction, not destruction</p>
<p>We want people's livelihood, not people's death</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 6th] Kong Xiangxi attended a welcome meeting held by all sectors of Taiyuan Provincial Government at 8:00 a.m. on the 6th. In his speech, he said: "Although the country is in difficulty, it has indeed made a lot of progress. On the way back from Pingyao to Bingzhou, I looked at the wheat seedlings from the air. They were very short, and there were still autumn crops that had not been planted. There has been a severe drought in Shanxi Province, resulting in the starvation of more than 300,000 people. Of course, we still hope for heavy rain now to hurry up and plant the late autumn crops. Even if there is no rain, we also hope to understand that air transportation is very convenient. Don't panic or hoard. Any political system in the world cannot be separated from selecting the virtuous and capable and emphasizing trustworthiness and good relations. When the Great Way is practiced, the world is for all." Kong replied to reporters, (2) The economic crisis is indeed very serious, but I am never pessimistic. When we won, organizing the economy was originally a golden opportunity, but unfortunately people's hearts are too bad. Some have armed internal strife, and some have taken over factories, but they have sealed off the factories. It's all because they haven't taken the world as their own and made plans. Don't destroy, we want people's livelihood, not people's death, we want democracy, not rebellion. The government is definitely not against the Communist Party, but it wants the Communist Party in democratic meetings. (3) I will go to the United States immediately after returning to Beijing. There are four tasks: (1) When I had surgery in the United States before, the doctor ordered a check-up every six months. (2) I will discuss the funding issues of Yenching and Yingshan with American school directors. (3) Participate in the Sino-American Cultural Association and the World Citizens Games. (4) The Bank of China handles exchange preparations to build bridges between domestic industry and commerce and overseas Chinese industry and commerce to subsidize the national economy.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits Cross the Yellow River to Invade and Destroy River Bank Restoration Work; Chen Panling Discusses the Impact on the Project</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, the Next Day] The main force of the communist bandit Liu Yibo and Cheng has completely crossed the river. The first attempt of the bandit army seems to be to destroy the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and then dig up the dikes to realize its ambition of large-scale destruction. This action of the communist bandits has been planned for a long time. They had built more than 100 ships and stored them in the trenches they dug. The reason why they opened the trenches at this time and released the ships to cross the south bank was to call for a halt to military operations in this area and the opportunity for the government to express its acceptance, in order to cooperate with the upcoming Yellow River flood season to carry out their so-called "destruction is revolution" rebellion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 5th] Chen Panling, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Project, issued a statement saying: "Thanks to the painstaking efforts, the construction and defense work of the Yellow River dikes in Hebei and Shandong have been fully prepared. Just when the great flood is approaching and the opportunity is fleeting, the communist bandits suddenly crossed the river in force in the Linji area of Shandong. The workers who had been recruited have all fled, and the materials that have been stored are in danger of being lost. Moreover, in the area upstream of Heigangkou in Henan Province and Dongming and other places in Hebei Province, the communist bandits constantly fired from the north bank to the south bank. Despite casualties, they still desperately robbed and were threatened at times, which greatly affected the project. The flood prevention and rescue project must seize the time. Even if the communist bandits can collapse in a short period of time, it will not be possible to re-recruit workers and purchase materials in a short period of time. With dikes that have not been repaired for ten years and are subjected to floods, we still dare not guarantee their absolute safety even if we exhaust our manpower and resources. Now, suddenly facing this unparalleled serious blow, the urgency of the project situation is obvious to everyone. This bureau can only try its best to find ways to maintain close contact with the board of directors, and, under possible circumstances, will still supervise the river workers to overcome difficulties and dangers, and go to resume work, in order to save the crisis in case of emergency."</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Chairman's Broadcast - Continued from First Edition</h3>
<p>Suppression of Bandits and Pacification of the Country - For the Sake of National Interests</p>
<p>Therefore, today's pacification and suppression of bandits is for the highest interests of the nation, as well as for the basic survival, democratic and free rights of the people. Fighting against the Communist bandits is no different from the sacred meaning of the War of Resistance against Japan. In other words, today's bandit suppression work is the continuation of the unfinished task of the War of Resistance against Japan. Just as I said to my fellow countrymen, it is a struggle that must be gone through to ensure the victorious fruits of the War of Resistance and to achieve the true independence and freedom of the nation. The successive and heroic sacrifices of our National Revolutionary Army soldiers should receive the same lofty respect as the martyrs of the War of Resistance. Providing sufficient food and troops, and enriching the frontline military, is the undeniable duty of each of our 450 million compatriots. In the sense of saving the country and protecting the people, regardless of region, whether it is the front or the rear, everyone is closely related and shares the same fate. I want to solemnly announce to our compatriots that from the recent Northeast campaign, we can see that the Communist bandits' ambition has been completely exposed, and the national crisis is increasingly aggravated. Therefore, everyone can no longer have any侥幸安 (expecting good luck and security) illusions, and can no longer have an attitude of being outside the military. We must urgently catch up, unify our will, concentrate our strength, unite the military and the people, strengthen the strength of bandit suppression, and strengthen construction work, to remove this eternal scourge for the country. We must implement total mobilization with the same spirit as during the War of Resistance, and we must be particularly invigorated and strict to correct the shortcomings that occurred during the War of Resistance. We must contribute all manpower, material resources, and lives without hesitation and without reservation, and work together for the cause of saving the country, saving our compatriots, and suppressing the chaos and settling the upheaval. Only in this way can we preserve the victorious fruits of the War of Resistance against Japan, and only then will the country have independence and freedom, and society have the hope of regaining security.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Total Mobilization - Arouse National Awareness</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, the National Government has already ordered the implementation of total mobilization for bandit suppression. The most important meaning of this total mobilization is to arouse the vigilance of the people of the whole country, to unify the will of the people of the whole country, and to concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country. We must call on the patriotic people of the whole country to rise up together, save the country and save themselves. The initial measures of the government must follow the legal path, and we fully trust the patriotic conscience of our compatriots, so that compatriots across the country will automatically and spontaneously serve the country under the great righteousness of the nation. But our citizens must love the country and respect themselves, abide by the laws of the country, and fulfill the duties of citizens. For tasks related to the Communist bandits, we must do our best to contribute to the suppression of bandits and construction work. Every action must benefit the progress of bandit suppression and construction work. Leaders from all walks of life in society who have status should take the lead in upholding justice and serving the public. Our youth across the country are entrusted with the fate of the nation. In particular, they must distinguish between right and wrong, identify obedience and rebellion, promote national consciousness, and protect national life. If the youth are willing to be tools for the Communist bandits, and are willing to see the country perish and the people灭绝 (die out), then so be it. Otherwise, everyone should recognize themselves as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, citizens of China, and seek independent survival for the Chinese nation, so that they can develop free thoughts in the future without being destroyed and persecuted by the Communist bandits. Then they must make up their minds, go to the country early, those who study should concentrate on studying, and those who work in agriculture, industry, and commerce should work hard to produce and increase national strength. Everyone should stick to their posts and fulfill their responsibilities, so that the social order in the rear is absolutely stable. The rebellion and the complete destruction of social order are mutually echoing and cooperating.</p>
<p>Respect People's Rights - But Do Not Connive at Evil</p>
<p>Since our War of Resistance against Japan, the Communist Party has consistently carried out malicious propaganda against the government's work of resisting Japan and building the country. Its purpose is to alienate the relationship between our government and the people, and to disperse the entire strength of the Republic of China. It degrades the status of the country, obliterates the history of the War of Resistance of our entire military and civilians, reduces the confidence of our people in saving the country, and frustrates the patriotic will of our people. They not only spread rumors, stir up trouble, and disrupt and destroy in schools, society, factories, and the economic sector, but they also openly declared that this kind of disturbance and destruction is their "second battle line" of rebellion, and military rebellion is their first battle line. The two support each other, which can not only affect society militarily, but also affect the front line from the rear. This is such a dangerous conspiracy that I must call on everyone to prevent it in time. I can declare to everyone that the government's implementation of total mobilization this time must be within the scope stipulated by law. The military and political organs at all levels must respect the basic rights of the people. However, for those who do not realize the national crisis, do not abide by the national righteousness, and are instigated by those who甘爱共匪乱国殃民 (cherish the communist bandits, disrupt the country, and harm the people), participate in the work of their "second battle line," and have acts that disrupt order and endanger security, the government, for the sake of the survival of the country and the happiness of the people, must not connive at evil, and must be responsible for banning them and punishing them in accordance with the law. At this time, when the military's suppression of bandits is actively underway, and the soldiers are fighting bloody battles, all my patriotic compatriots must be united, united as one, recognize the goals clearly, and work actively. Only in this way can we strengthen military strength, shorten the date of the war, and achieve the goal of 평叛乱 (suppressing the rebellion) as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The government's decisions on the current situation have been seen in the resolutions of the State Council. This total mobilization is not only mobilized for the military victory of bandit suppression, but also for seeking national reform and labor construction. Therefore, I would like to point out the following two points to my compatriots.</p>
<p>Implementing Constitutional Government - Not Delayed Due to Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>First, we must devote ourselves to completing the work of national construction. Today, of course, we must concentrate our strength, strengthen the military, suppress the rebellion, and achieve unification. On the one hand, we must also work hard to build and increase production to break the Communist bandits' conspiracy to hinder national construction and endanger people's livelihood. In particular, our work to implement constitutional government and promote democracy will never be delayed because of bandit suppression. The Communist Party shouts democracy but opposes constitutional government, refuses to participate in the National Assembly, and does its best to undermine the progress of the national construction process. This shows that the Communist bandits fundamentally do not want China to have a constitutional government, fundamentally do not care about China's implementation of democracy, and fundamentally do not want China to complete production and construction. If China implements a constitutional government, it will have to disarm its private armed forces before the constitutional government and lose its basis for treason; if China embarks on the broad road of democracy, and the people rise up to be the masters of the country, then their so-called proletarian dictatorship and the terrifying policy of dictatorship will not be able to carry out its deception and oppression before the public opinion of the people. Moreover, once China implements constitutional government and democracy, and completes the economic construction that it should have, it will 不能製迭 (not be able to fabricate) social chaos and economic panic, and will not be able to rely on the hunger and poverty of the people to achieve its conspiracy to establish a Soviet regime. Therefore, I want to 正吿 (solemnly tell) my compatriots across the country, 正吿 (solemnly tell) all compatriots who are truly working for democracy, freedom, and the establishment of a modern country, we must eliminate this Communist bandit armed group that is fundamentally incompatible with democracy, freedom, and reconstruction. At the same time, precisely because we want to free China from the clutches of terrorism that creates chaos and hunger, we should urgently catch up, complete the constitutional government, prepare to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, protect the 基本 (basic) rights of the people, and improve the economic life of the people. We must never waver our consistent confidence and relax our due efforts.</p>
<p>While Carrying Out Bandit Suppression - Reform Internal Affairs</p>
<p>Second, we must do our best to promote national reform and progress. Now, on the one hand, we must carry out the bandit suppression war, and on the other hand, we must reform internal affairs. I do not shy away from the fact that the government itself has various shortcomings, and our society also has many weaknesses. After eight years of arduous resistance, there was followed the disaster of the Communist bandits' rebellion, which made the government and society unable to breathe, and it was difficult to balance the treatment of symptoms and root causes, and the national strength and people's strength were even more exhausted. After the war, various shortcomings and weaknesses were even more exposed, resulting in deepening pain for the people and a scattered national will. If the government cannot decisively reform and strive for progress, our country will not be able to survive in the modern world. Therefore, our political, economic, educational, social, and other aspects of reform must not wait for the end of the bandit suppression military, but should begin to be implemented immediately. We must replenish the country's strength through thorough reform, relieve the suffering of the people, and unify the will of the government and the people, in order to break through the national difficulties that the country is currently facing. The government will sincerely adopt and strive to correct any opinions and contributions from our compatriots regarding the shortcomings of politics and economy, and the location of the people's livelihood. For the mistakes in the administration of governments at all levels, we hope to point out examples and make incisive accusations, so that they can be earnestly corrected. Our implementation of total mobilization this time is to gather the strength of the government and the people, with one heart and one mind, self-reflecting and self-conscious, to reform the accumulated ills of politics and eliminate all obstacles that hinder national progress. Therefore, the meaning of our total mobilization is not passive but active, not local but national, not a one-sided responsibility for the people, but also a spur to the progress and construction of our governments at all levels and local societies. Zhongzheng (Chiang Kai-shek) has devoted himself to the revolution, and has always struggled to save the country from danger, struggled to implement the Three Principles of the People, and struggled to unify the country, build the country, and realize constitutional democracy. Personal success or failure, gain or loss, praise or blame, and glory or disgrace are not what he cares about. What I can tell my compatriots is only a sincere loyalty to save the country and save the people. I will never fail the Father of the Nation and the revolutionary martyrs, I will never go against the original intention of the revolution to save the country, and I will never fail the military and civilians who shared weal and woe during the eight years of the War of Resistance. I will do my best to preserve the fruits of our victory in the War of Resistance. I vow to lead all my compatriots to the end, to the end, with life and death, to the end, against any enemy that hinders the realization of our ideology, undermines our national unity, and hinders our national construction and progress.</p>
<p>Remove Obstacles to National Construction - Complete the Great Cause of National Construction</p>
<p>My compatriots across the country: As we approach today's sacred anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance against Japan, I ask compatriots across the country to revive the spirit of national unity and courageous advancement during the War of Resistance, and to strengthen our confidence in removing obstacles to national construction and completing the great cause of national construction. I announced to my compatriots across the country early when we won the War of Resistance: "Our task of post-war revival and national construction is ten times more difficult than during the war." Given the depth of internal and external troubles China has suffered in the past century, and given the weakness of our national and social foundations, it is not something that can be achieved overnight to build a new China that is prosperous, healthy, independent, and free. But our country has such a long history, such a large population, and such excellent and persevering national virtues, I can assert that any stubborn resistance will not be able to hinder our country's revival, as long as our compatriots rise up with the same determination and patience as during the War of Resistance, and work actively, the Communist bandits' rebellion will be quelled in the shortest possible time. After we overcome this last difficulty and remove this biggest obstacle, the nation can enter a bright and splendid path. Therefore, our compatriots must not be confused by the Communist bandits' false propaganda, and must not be discouraged by the current difficult situation and shake their self-confidence. I hope that my compatriots will not forget the oath of "Victory in the War of Resistance" at that time, strengthen our belief in "National Construction will be achieved," promote the great achievements of the victory in the War of Resistance, break through all the difficulties and obstacles, eliminate the Communist bandits, eliminate the red disaster, in order to complete the great cause of national construction, and comfort the spirits of the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and bandit suppression (End)</p>

<h3>A Dedication on the Tenth Anniversary of the War of Resistance – After Reading Chairman Chiang's Broadcast to the Nation</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, a great memorial day woven with blood, tears, and sweat by our Chinese nation. It has been exactly ten years since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred; in the past eight years, although we fought arduously in the war, enduring all kinds of suffering and torment, the people of the whole country believed that this was a sacred war related to the survival of our nation, and believed that final victory would belong to us: therefore, in the past eight years, every July 7th, we always felt that the gate of victory was one day closer to us, we often shed excited sweat, commemorating this great day; and spurred us on to shed blood and sweat to strive for victory. Eight "July 7ths" have passed, and we have finally won the final victory, making the past eight years an unprecedented and most glorious era in the modern history of our country.</p>
<p>This day last year, we encountered the ninth "July 7th," more than ten months after the arrival of victory. Not only did we not see the country embarking on the road of national construction and revival, but we also witnessed the fruits of victory beginning to spoil, which made us have to respond with bitter tears. Today, this year, is the second "July 7th" after the victory of the War of Resistance. Remembering the hardships of the past war of resistance, the heroic blood shed by the martyrs has been passed down through the ages: but looking forward to the future of the country, with various terrible crises lurking, we feel the great responsibility we bear. If we cannot fulfill the mission of "national construction," how can we be worthy of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for righteousness! Therefore, on this day this year, we must never just respond with tears like last year, but should revive the spirit of striving for victory by shedding sweat and blood during the War of Resistance, remove all obstacles on the road to national construction, and achieve the great cause of national construction. Today, the colleagues of this newspaper, in addition to mourning the war-dead soldiers and the victims, express their feelings, and are willing to warn and encourage themselves together with the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>First, the victory won by our country in the eight-year War of Resistance was achieved at a very heavy price: we must not allow the fruits of victory to mold and rot. In the hearts of us Chinese people, there is a very painful memory: as soon as the sound of cannons rang out at the Lugouqiao Bridge, the aggressive arrogance of the Japanese invaders was pressing, forcing our Chinese nation to engage in a life-and-death struggle. The "August 13th" Battle of Songhu followed, leading to a full-scale war between China and Japan. Later, the Battle of Pingjin, the Battle of Taierzhuang, the Battle of Xuzhou, the Battle of Wuhan, the Battle of Changsha, the Battle of Henan and Hubei, the Battle of Hunan and Guangxi, the Battle of Sui and Jin, and the Battle of Yunnan and Burma, from the northern desert to the southern Qiongya, almost the entire territory of China was ravaged by the Japanese invaders, and the number of soldiers and civilians who made heroic sacrifices, one after another, was more than tens of millions! The victory was exchanged for the heads of tens of millions of people; how can we not cherish it especially. But since the arrival of victory, less than two years have passed, all the beautiful dreams after the victory have vanished, and defeated Japan is about to stir again: Japan's ninety-year-old veteran parliamentarian Ozaki Yukio even put forward an absurd proposal, advocating that in Northeast China, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Korea, a referendum should be held when public order is restored to determine whether the people in each place hope to be independent or willing to join which country. From this alone, we can know that defeated Japan is trying to make a comeback. Looking back at our own China, in the seats of international conferences, it often suffers the humiliation and exclusion of other countries. The so-called "one of the five powers," China has long been nominal. The failure to receive Lushun and Dalian, and the invasion of our country's Xinjiang Province by Mongolian troops, all show that China will once again suffer the threat of foreign aggression. If we do not rise up and strive to become strong, then not only will the blood of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians be shed in vain, but China will once again become the invaded. Therefore, on this day this year, we have to cry out loudly to raise the people's vigilance about national affairs; in any case, we must preserve the fruits of victory and never allow them to mold and rot.</p>
<p>Second, although the domestic and international situation makes us feel the danger to the country's future: it is not difficult to break a bloody path out of the encirclement. At present, the most urgent task is to remove all obstacles on the road to national construction. Looking at it from afar, the evolution of the international situation in the past two years has formed the current situation of two major camps confronting each other, which no one could have predicted. In the past, the world still had some hope for the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, but to this day, facts have proved that the possibility of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly slim. The Soviet Union's attack on Marshall's aid plan for Europe has the intention of dividing Europe: while Britain and France believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European recovery plan is the first step in dividing Europe. According to this, the antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, and it has reached the stage of close combat; we have repeatedly pointed out that China is a peace-loving country, and it is willing for the world to "unite" rather than "divide." The division of the world will only benefit the defeated countries. The United States, under this situation, will inevitably actively assist Germany in its economic recovery, which goes without saying; the United States will adopt a policy of supporting Japan even more. The rise of Japan is a threat to China's security, so the United States' policy toward Japan cannot but make China uneasy. But if we can adopt an attitude of "seeking the answer from ourselves," reflecting and warning ourselves, then we cannot but complain about ourselves, why can't victorious China unite sincerely and strive to become strong? Instead, it consumes its national strength in domestic wars? God helps those who help themselves. When the United States sees that defeated Japan can get on track and be orderly in everything, it cannot but have a psychology of bias toward Japan: but the United States' adoption of this policy toward Japan will inevitably cause a catastrophe in the Far East in the future, and the first to bear the brunt will be our China. If the third world war breaks out, no matter what its nature, if China is the battlefield, it will ultimately be the misfortune of the Chinese people. Therefore, this kind of international situation is brewing, and for the sake of China's future, and for the sake of peace in the Far East, we should try to eliminate it. If our internal problems cannot be solved, it will naturally reduce our international status. Let us think calmly, the Communist Party cannot escape the blame for creating the current situation in the two years since the victory! Last night, Chairman Chiang broadcast to the nation, also explaining the situation of our country. Chairman Chiang said: "The main actions of the Communist bandits in the past year have been concentrated on destroying transportation, destroying industry and mining, and destroying the dying countryside everywhere. Every time the government issues a ceasefire order, it only helps the Communist Party to expand further, and only makes the post-war social recovery more difficult. Now, our compatriots across the country can clearly recognize that the Communist Party has absolutely no sincerity to repent." Facing this dangerous situation, if we cannot unite as a country to quell the rebellion, then our Republic of China will inevitably be divided and destroyed by the Communist Party. Therefore, when we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance, we should restore the spirit of the War of Resistance and strengthen our belief in the inevitable success of national construction; make up our minds to be the government's backing, and remove all obstacles on the road to national construction in the shortest possible time, so as to embark on the road to national construction!</p>
<p>In conclusion, we cannot but express our supreme respect for the soldiers who have been fighting hard in the front lines, and who have not been able to return home after the victory, and who are still there to remove obstacles on the road to national construction. As Chairman Chiang said: "The fact that the compatriots in the rear can still maintain their normal way of life today depends entirely on the national army soldiers who are sacrificing themselves on the front lines to suppress bandits and save the people: otherwise, they would have already fallen into the same tragic situation as the people in the Communist bandit areas of North China and Northeast China." These words are most worthy of our people in the rear to appreciate and think deeply about!</p>

<h3>Marshall Aid Plan May Extend to the Far East Discussions May be Proposed in the Far East Economic Commission</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chenggong Lake, 5th, United Press] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is scheduled to hold a meeting here on the 10th, which may informally discuss extending the Marshall Aid Plan to the Far East. The representative of the committee will also discuss the possibility of the Soviet Union boycotting the meeting. This meeting will be officially named the Plenary Committee Meeting, and its purpose is to complete the rules of procedure and discuss other maintenance issues. The agenda item closest to the Marshall Plan is the proposal made by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East at the Shanghai meeting. Observers here said: Although the Marshall Plan was proposed to aid Europe, the United States has responsibilities in Japan, Korea, and other parts of the world. It is recalled that at the Shanghai meeting, Soviet representative Stetsenko said that the Soviet Union might not send representatives to attend the Plenary Committee, and the committee seemed to have a tendency to ignore the Soviet Union's views on military and important issues. Mr. Shi opposed the establishment of a Plenary Committee and authorized it to report directly to the Economic and Social Council. He said: This decision makes the work of the committee itself decorative. In addition, the chairman of the Shanghai meeting, Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, will arrive here on the 8th or 9th to submit a report on the Far East meeting.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Albanian capital, 6th] The Albanian "Bashkimi" newspaper today criticized the Paris meeting, saying: "The meeting will teach the imperialists that they cannot buy the freedom and independence of European countries with dollars."</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Meets with Soviet Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Rome, 6th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza met with Soviet Ambassador to Italy Kostilov today and had talks. According to political figures, the content of the talks was about Italy's acceptance of the Anglo-French invitation to participate in the Paris Economic Conference and the Soviet Union's delay in ratifying the peace treaty with Italy.</p>
<h3>French Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Publish Documents of Foreign Ministers' Meeting</h3>
<p>Molotov Sends a Telegram to Thank Bidault</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 5th] It is learned that the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs will publish the various documents of the recent Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting in a yellow book. The British Foreign Office is not prepared to take the same steps. In addition, it is learned that French Foreign Minister Bidault has received a telegram from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued on the 3rd of this month, which said: The Soviet representative was sincerely entertained in Paris, and now he hastily returns to his country and would like to express his gratitude to your Excellency.</p>
<h3>Lie Returns Home for Vacation</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York, 5th] Before departing for Norway for vacation, United Nations Secretary-General Lie issued a statement denying that the US aid plan for Europe exceeded the authority of the United Nations. Mr. Lie also said that all developments in Paris have been given detailed reports by Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Britain and France's Attitude Toward Spain Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 5th] Authoritative sources here said: On the eve of Franco's holding a referendum in Spain to decide the succession law, his broadcast to the nation, although declaring that Spain had completed the resolution of the Anglo-French refusal to invite Spain to participate in the Paris meeting in terms of legislation and social work. Britain and France's neglect of Spain is only because Britain and France believe that the Spanish government is not a democratic government, and the United Nations organization is also not prepared to cooperate with Spain under the current circumstances. Franco's speech did not change these views of Britain and France.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 5th, United Press] Official sources said that Spain will lodge a strong protest with the British Foreign Office against Spain not being allowed to participate in the negotiations on the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Social and Economic Council Will Discuss the Cooperative League Alliance Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press Chenggong Lake, 5th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to meet here on the 19th of this month to discuss the proposal of the International Cooperative Alliance, that is, the United Nations Organization will establish an agency to manage the oil resources in the Middle East within the scope permitted by the countries concerned. People from Britain and the United States believe that the United Nations Agency cannot effectively manage the oil resources in the Middle East, so they expressed their opposition.</p>
<h3>The French Political Situation Remains Unstable</h3>
<p>Supporters of the Government May Split</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 5th] Regarding the National Assembly's passage of the vote of confidence in the Ramadier cabinet, political figures here are very satisfied with this. The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held a meeting today to discuss the economic policies adopted by the government, and a vote will be held tomorrow. It is expected that Prime Minister Ramadier will not receive a majority of support. According to the calculation, when the French Communist Party withdrew from the government, the Ramadier cabinet only obtained the support of 2,529 votes against 2,125 votes. But at this moment, although Prime Minister Ramadier has overcome some obstacles, he still cannot rest easy, because the majority of those who support the government still have the potential to split.</p>
<h3>Bevin's Warning to the Soviet Union Deeply Shocked the British and American Circles</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 5th] Regarding the speech made by British Foreign Minister Bevin last night on the American National Day, according to news received here from New York, the stimulation caused by this speech in the United States is even greater than that caused in Britain. Foreign Minister Bevin warned the Soviet leaders not to irritate Britain too much, lest it become unbearable. There are also many people in Britain who are indignant because the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate with other countries. Although all of this is worthy of attention, it does not mean that this kind of emotion is generally held by the British people or their responsible people. On the contrary, important British figures all hope that the Soviet Union's refusal is not final in nature. In any case, the failure of the Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting should never be regarded as the "last chance" for understanding between Western and Eastern Europe has disappeared. There are also some points in Foreign Minister Bevin's speech that are quite important, such as his expression of willingness to cooperate with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Eden Delivers a Speech in Support of Bevin's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 5th] Former Foreign Minister Eden delivered a speech here on the 5th, supporting Bevin's actions, that is, preparing to carry out Marshall's plan regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate. Eden's speech said: "The task of the rulers of our country is very clear, they must plan together with our French friends and other countries willing to participate, so as to respond to Marshall's historical contribution and make it happen quickly. It is especially important because the European economy is extremely serious and there should be no hesitation. We hope that some small Eastern European countries, whose need for economic assistance is no less than ours, can come to participate in this plan regardless of the Soviet Union's unwillingness." Although Eden supported the government's foreign policy, he severely condemned the domestic economic plan. He warned: "If Britain continues to squander American loans at the current rate, our American credit will run out before Christmas this afternoon, and we will supplement it with our own financial resources, but according to the current expenditure, it will not be able to support it for another year."</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Poland Takes Office</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Warsaw, 5th] The newly appointed US Ambassador to Poland, Griffiths, came to take office and arrived here today.</p>
<h3>Truman Calls on the People to Continue to Help Relieve the Famine Abroad</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 6th] President Truman yesterday published a report that the United States provided 8.5 million tons of food to foreign countries by June 30, 1947, and warned the United States that there are still millions of people in the world in a state of extreme starvation. The United States should do its best to continue to alleviate human suffering and help other countries engage in self-help. The President emphasized that although the United States' harvest this year has exceeded historical records, the United States should not ignore that even with the greatest efforts of the United States and other food exporting countries, it cannot meet the food emergency needs of the post-war world. The severe cold in Northern Europe last winter affected the harvest, so in the coming months, the United States still needs to export a large amount of food.</p>
<h3>Hungary's General Election in September</h3>
<p>[Reuters Budapest, 5th] Today it was added that Hungary's general election will be held in September, and the new election law can be submitted to the parliament at the end of this month, and it is expected that the number of recognized members will increase.</p>
<h3>"Flying Saucers" Discovered Over the United States What Are They? Opinions Vary</h3>
<p>[United Press Portland, Oregon, 6th] After reports from 33 states yesterday successively reported the discovery of disk-shaped objects with great speed in the sky, the people of the whole country were confused and lost. Several US military aircraft equipped with photography equipment are ready to search today. A B-30 aircraft is now waiting to be launched at Muroc Army Air Base in California, and six P-51 aircraft are gathered here to attempt to偵察 what these mysterious flying saucers are. Scientists and soldiers all admit that they cannot explain this phenomenon. The Army and Navy announced that it was not a military test aircraft: Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Lilienthal said that it had nothing to do with the Commission's experimental work. Two astronomers in Chicago said that the flying saucer may be "artificial." Kouber, director of the Yerkes Observatory at the University of Chicago, believes that it is definitely not a meteorite. Lee, Dean of the DePaul College of Northwestern University, said: "We now know for sure that the Army and Navy are studying all kinds of things that do not exist in the world. Flying saucers and those who send thunder signals to the moon are of the same nature and are one of the greatest technological achievements of this year, and their construction has been absolutely kept secret." In addition, the "Los Angeles Observer" quoted a scientist as saying: "These flying saucers may be the result of atomic energy transformation experiments. The speed is very high, but it can be controlled from the ground, with a radius of twenty feet, and part of it is propelled by rockets during takeoff." In addition, Ully, an atomic scientist at the University of Chicago, held the opposite view, calling it absurd. When the first report of the discovery of flying saucers was made on the 25th of last month, the general public scoffed at it, but so far there have been hundreds of reports, and most of them are trained pilots, which makes this matter more credible. On the 4th of this month, a group of 200 people in Idaho and another group of 60 people witnessed similar reports in the eastern states. But there are many different opinions on some of the characteristics of flying saucers, such as size, speed, brightness, circular or elliptical shape, and the strange volatility of flight posture.</p>
<h3>Cultural and Economic Agreement Signed Relationship Between Poland and Czechoslovakia Increased The List of Members of the Czechoslovak Delegation to the Soviet Union Determined</h3>
<p>[Reuters Prague, 5th] Prague and Warsaw simultaneously issued a communique today, reporting on the results of the Polish delegation's visit to Prague to discuss how to strengthen relations between the two countries. The Polish delegation was personally led by Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and arrived in Prague on Sunday. The communique reported that the two countries had signed a cultural and economic agreement, and emphasized that both parties believed that it was necessary to implement this agreement in the long term.</p>
<p>In addition to negotiating the details of the implementation of the aforementioned agreement, the representatives of the two countries only decided to implement the provisions of the annexes to the Czechoslovak-Polish alliance treaty signed in Warsaw on March 10 in the shortest possible time, that is, to enable the Czechs and Slavs in the territory and the Poles in the Czech territory to enjoy full power of national political, cultural, and economic development. The communique further declared that the two sides have agreed to establish a Polish consulate in Ostrava, Czech Republic, and a Czech consulate in Katowice, Poland, soon. Finally, the communique stated that after the representatives of the two countries exchanged views on various issues concerning the international situation, especially the German issue, it was known that the positions of the two governments were completely consistent.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Czech capital, 5th] The Czech Christian People's Party newspaper reported today that the members of the Czech delegation who are about to go to Moscow to conclude a commercial agreement with the Soviet Union have been changed due to the changed political situation after the failure of the Paris Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting. It will now be led by Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk, and Minister of Foreign Trade Ripka is also one of the representatives. When the Czech delegation is in Moscow, it will discuss political issues with Soviet representatives. As for the goals of the Czech delegation and the length of their stay in Moscow, officials have not yet issued any statements. But according to observers, one of the main issues that the Czech delegation should discuss with the Soviet authorities will be the issue of Britain and France inviting the Czech Republic to participate in the European Economic Conference. The Czech Republic urgently needs US assistance, and this issue may be completely resolved in Moscow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Workers' Grand Parade: Support Current Government</h3>
<p>Urge Implementation of Socialist Party Platform</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 6th] Over 20,000 members of the All-Japan Labor Union Association marched in the Imperial Palace Plaza on the morning of the 6th to support Katayama's socialist government. This is the first labor parade to support the government since the occupation of Japan.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 6th] Since the Katayama Cabinet, centered around the Socialist Party, came into power, many of the policies it proposed to the Japanese people when it was in opposition have not been implemented due to compromises with conservative forces, causing dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. On the 6th, Tokyo worker groups convened a Socialist Party encouragement rally at noon, attended by 30,000 workers, who unanimously criticized the Socialist Party's weak policies and demanded that the party implement its platform from its time in opposition. The assembly resolved to present the following three opinions to Mr. Katayama: (1) The government-stipulated industry-specific wages effectively freeze wages and are therefore opposed. (2) Ensure the rationing of essential living supplies and the minimum standard of living for the people. (3) Immediately abolish labor income tax. This resolution was immediately handed to Mr. Nishio, the Socialist Party representative attending the meeting. Mr. Nishio immediately stated that the Socialist Party's policies during its time in opposition would be gradually implemented. The meeting adjourned at 2 p.m. that day.</p>
<h3>American Journalists Invited to Inspect Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 5th] A group of newspaper publishers and editors, invited by the Department of the Army, is scheduled to depart on the 8th for Japan to inspect the American military occupation work. The list of names and itinerary are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Spanish Succession Law: Referendum Held Yesterday. Cabinet to be Reorganized Upon Passage</h3>
<p>[United Press Madrid, 5th] Spain held a referendum on the 5th, and Franco's "Succession Law" is expected to pass by a large majority. It is rumored that after the government obtains this "vote of confidence," the cabinet will be reorganized. Franco plans to appoint a prime minister, so that he can focus on his duties as head of state. Today's referendum is the first in Spain in eleven years. The expected results are 75% to 85% in favor, 15% neutral, and no more than 10% opposed. According to semi-official forecasts, 60% of the 16,187,092 eligible voters will vote. Anti-Franco factions have been ordered not to vote, or to cast blank ballots. The leaders are restorationists. The National Labor Confederation and the General Chamber of Commerce, lacking freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, can only engage in clandestine activities. The effectiveness of their opposition will only be clear when the national voting results are announced on July 26th. The only issue in the referendum is the Succession Law, which stipulates that Franco is the head of state, Spain is a "Kingdom," and when Franco voluntarily resigns or dies, a king or regent will succeed him in governing. This law has already been promulgated by Franco by decree and passed by parliament.</p>
<h3>Australia Opposes Coddling Japan: Foreign Minister Evatt to Meet MacArthur for Discussions. U.S. Fears British Veto in Japanese Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press Sydney, 6th] When Australian Foreign Minister Evatt meets with MacArthur in the middle of next week, he will lodge a strong protest against "one-man rule" in Japan. Australian government newspapers and the people seem to be united in opposing the U.S. government's view that the occupation policy towards Japan is appropriate. Protests against Japanese whaling and the excavation of phosphate mines reflect Australia's dissatisfaction. The criticism of Australian newspapers regarding this matter is the most intense anti-American rhetoric in years. The MacArthur-Evatt meeting is expected to improve strained relations between the U.S. and Australia. While the meeting is generally regarded as "private" rather than "political," Evatt will present an overview of Australian grievances from a friendly standpoint. Australian observers believe this meeting is crucial, as the British Imperial Conference will convene in Australia in mid-August to formulate British Imperial policy on the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 5th] U.S. officials, reportedly deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's "abuse" of veto power in the United Nations, strongly oppose the U.S. relinquishing its veto power in the future Japanese peace conference. They strongly advocate that the U.S. retain its veto privilege, fearing that the United Kingdom, with a majority of member states, would effectively wield a veto power in the Japanese peace conference. The disagreement over whether to use the veto power in the Japanese peace conference has become a fundamental conflict between the U.S. and the British Empire. This winter or next spring is the most likely time for convening the Japanese peace conference. U.S. officials do not believe that the Japanese peace treaty should be formulated by the Council of Foreign Ministers drafting the European peace treaties. The State Department hopes that the current member states of the Far Eastern Commission will draft it. Resolutions will be passed by a two-thirds majority. In other words, any issue requires eight affirmative votes to pass, but any resolution cannot pass if there are four negative votes. Therefore, U.S. officials believe that under concerted action, the British Empire would effectively wield a veto power, as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will all attend the Japanese peace conference. Furthermore, India and the Netherlands, known for supporting British Far Eastern policy, will also be attending the Japanese peace conference, and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt is the most vocal opponent of the veto power.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom will convene a meeting in Canberra on August 22nd to discuss policy on the Japanese peace treaty. U.S. officials deeply fear that this meeting will formulate a policy that allows Britain to absolutely control the Japanese peace treaty and has the power to block any resolution that Britain dislikes.</p>
<h3>International Tariff Negotiations: Six Groups Reach Agreements</h3>
<p>[Reuters Geneva, 6th] The Preparatory Committee of the International Trade Organization has issued a report revealing that four groups of countries have completed tariff negotiations: South Africa and Chile, China and South Africa, South Africa and Cuba, and Chile and Norway. In addition, Canada and Norway, and South Africa and Czechoslovakia have also reached agreements. Therefore, out of a total of ninety groups, six have completed tariff negotiations. The report also states that agreements already reached may be revised depending on other negotiations.</p>
<h3>Indian Interim Government Resigns. Northwest Frontier Province Holds Referendum. Maisky to be Appointed Soviet Ambassador to India</h3>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 5th] Indian Interim Government Vice President Nehru and his cabinet have submitted their resignations to Governor-General Mountbatten. Political figures believe that the resignation of the Interim Government is a natural consequence of the Indian Independence Act being presented to the British House of Commons. The Governor-General will now reorganize the Indian government to conform to the provisions of the partition plan.</p>
<p>The Northwest Frontier Province will hold a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the province will belong to Pakistan or Hindustan. Province Governor Lockhart announced that for the eleven days of the vote, the entire province will be considered a "disturbed area," and those who attempt murder, kidnapping, or illegal arrest will be subject to the death penalty. It is reported that the Congress Party's provincial cabinet does not support joining Pakistan or Hindustan, but advocates the establishment of an independent Pathanistan state.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 6th] "The People's Daily" reports that the former Soviet ambassador to Britain, Mr. Maisky, will be appointed as the first Soviet ambassador to India. The newspaper also states that Jinnah's Pakistan is striving to establish closer relations with Afghanistan. Therefore, Nehru will soon personally go to Moscow to prevent Pakistan and Afghanistan from joining hands, and also to prevent them from forming a large-scale Islamic group with Middle Eastern Arab countries.</p>
<h3>Chinese Painting Exhibition Opens in Geneva</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Geneva, 5th Dispatch] The Chinese painting exhibition organized by Dr. Hu Tianshi, the director of the Chinese Library in Geneva, opened this afternoon at a famous museum here. The exhibition includes 170 selected works, 70 of which are by Wu Zuoren, a professor at the former National Beiping Art College and Central University. There are also many masterpieces by outstanding Chinese male and female painters, as well as 50 works collected by the Chinese Ministry of Education. On display are also 30 classical and modern works from the Song Dynasty onwards from the collection of the Chinese Library here. The exhibition will be open for one month.</p>
<h3>Japan Commemorates "Black Ship Festival." Acheson Discusses Policy Towards Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Shimoda, Japan, 5th] U.S. Navy Commodore Perry, who led ships 94 years ago to urge Japan to trade with foreign countries, is commemorated by the Japanese with the "Black Ship" Festival since 1930. It was suspended during the war and has now resumed today.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 6th] On this day commemorating the first landing of U.S. Commodore Perry in Japan in 1854, Allied Control Council Chairman Acheson issued a statement declaring that one of the main goals of the U.S. policy towards Japan after the war is to establish a peaceful and responsible Japan. Less than two generations after Perry's arrival in Japan, Japan began adopting Western civilization and the advantages of modern warfare. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Japanese people, who now abhor militarism, will adopt a democratic system suitable for their domestic needs and foreign responsibilities. The U.S. has done its best under various difficulties to provide food relief to the Japanese people. The U.S. is willing to enable Japan to become self-sufficient as soon as possible and will not deprive Japan of anything needed for a peaceful economy and for creating its responsible position in foreign affairs.</p>
<h3>General Yarnell Discusses U.S. Defense Elements</h3>
<p>[United Press Culver City, Indiana, 6th] Retired Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, stated in a speech at the opening ceremony of the summer naval school at Culver Military Academy on the 6th that universal military training "may be useful," but this is not the most important factor in U.S. preparedness. France also implemented compulsory military training, but still collapsed because France was a politically divided country, and its army lacked unity, morale, and efficiency. The elements of U.S. preparedness should include fully developing our economic and financial strength, developing our resources, and developing the morality and physique of our people.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Basic U.S. Policy</h3>
<p>—Special Translation by this Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>The basic policy of the United States is to safeguard its own security, promote its well-being, and assist other countries in the world to the extent possible. The United States simultaneously adopts two supplementary policies to achieve these goals. These two policies are: (1) Strengthening the United Nations organization as quickly and fully as possible; (2) Ensuring that the United States is capable of defending itself and providing possible support to all friendly nations.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that the United States cannot rely on the United Nations to safeguard its security in the coming years. At the same time, the conflict of interests and policies between the countries controlled by the Soviet Union and the Western powers led by the United States is a persistent concern for world peace. This is also a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>Among all the countries in the world left over from the war, the United States is one of the most fortunate countries. Therefore, various parties are requesting it to assume international obligations, the scope of which is obviously beyond what the United States can independently bear. In terms of the actual capabilities of the United States, all requests worthy of consideration should see if they possess one of the three reasons, strategic, economic, or humanitarian. Obligations based on strategic reasons are related to the long-term security and stability of the United States itself. If this security relationship is not very close, then the impact of those obligations on the economic interests of the United States must be examined. As for humanitarian obligations, they may be unavoidable and relatively large in number. However, examining the relationship of these obligations to U.S. security and interests, their status is secondary to strategic obligations and economic obligations related to security. The greatest contribution of humanitarianism is to avoid another world war.</p>
<p>To examine the urgency and scope of the requests of various countries for U.S. aid, the world can be divided into five regions for consideration. These five regions are: (1) the Middle East, (2) Central Europe, (3) Western Europe, (4) the Far East, (5) South America.</p>
<p>Middle East</p>
<p>The Middle East (including the eastern Mediterranean) is a region of active concern for U.S. policy at present. This is evidenced by aid to Greece and Turkey. This is due to the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States have recently become leaders of two opposing worlds, Britain is unable to maintain its dominant position in the region, and the importance of the large oil reserves in the region is increasing.</p>
<p>Although the direct relationship of the United States with the Middle East is relatively recent, this relationship is very important. The future security and progress of the world depend on the ultimate cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western bloc. Until this cooperation is realized, and to help the success of this cooperation, U.S. policy must contain the Soviet system within its current scope. It is generally recognized that the United States must lead this obligation. The Middle East and Central Europe are two extremely important regions for exercising this leadership.</p>
<p>Turkey is the keystone of the Middle East, and Greece is the arch. If Greece falls under Soviet control, Turkey will inevitably follow. At that time, the Muslim world will be invaded by communism, and the oil reserves in the Middle East will be exploited by the Soviet Union, and Western countries will have no share in them. The Soviet bloc will not only gain a wider area, abundant resources, and an excellent strategic position, but also increase the prestige and strength of the spread of communism.</p>
<p>Speaking of the scope of U.S. obligations in the Middle East, some believe that to prevent future cost increases, it is best to fully invest at present, so that Turkey becomes the Middle East's fortress to prevent the expansion of Soviet power. The results of U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey and the scope of future involvement, although unpredictable, are safer and cheaper to strengthen the dikes now to prevent problems before they happen than to rescue a flood later.</p>
<p>Central Europe</p>
<p>Central Europe (referring to Germany, Austria, and the ports of the Strait) is as important as the Middle East, but the situation in these two regions is completely different. First, the Central European issue is still under negotiation, and the aftermath of the war has not yet been completed. Second, Central Europe has not only political or military problems, but also economic problems. Third, the armies of the Soviet Union and the Western powers each occupy a zone, facing each other.</p>
<p>The obligations assumed in the Middle East are relatively new, but the obligations in Central Europe are the earliest and unavoidable. The only question is how to deal with the situation in Central Europe in the most appropriate way to reduce it to a sustainable level. The main reason is the absolute necessity of military occupation and long-term economic assistance from the United States. The more indirect reason is the promotion of anti-communist policies. This task must continue for several years.</p>
<p>Western Europe</p>
<p>The scope of obligations borne by the third region in need of U.S. economic assistance, Western Europe, depends on the success of the United States in resolving the Central European issue. The more unfavorable the developments in Central Europe, the greater the obligations of the United States in Western Europe.</p>
<p>However, the relationship between the price of the United States rebuilding the economy of Western Europe and the U.S. policy of opposing the expansion of the Soviet bloc should not be viewed too closely. U.S. economic assistance to Western Europe, especially to Britain and France, can also be regarded as an investment in the future economic interests of the United States, with the hope of recovering it in the future. On the other hand, we acknowledge that political unrest and economic hardship are sufficient bases for communist activity. Any measures taken by the United States to prevent or overcome these disturbing postures are, in fact, attacking communism.</p>
<p>Far East</p>
<p>The fourth region for which U.S. foreign aid must be assessed is China and the Far East. The problems here are different in nature and scope from those in the Middle East and Central Europe. Although China and Korea are adjacent to the Soviet region, they are farther from the center of Soviet activity, and history has shown us. China's territory is too large, and its national character is too elastic, and it is not easy to conquer, assimilate, or dominate. From the American point of view, the strategic problem of the Far East has changed greatly with the defeat of Japan. The Far East is no longer a region under high political pressure. Part of its difficulty is that there is no strong country there.</p>
<p>The spread of communism in Manchuria, North China, and Korea is inevitably a major obstacle to U.S. policy, and it also has a significant impact on the United Nations organization and the economic and political interests of the United States in the region. However, as long as the United States continues to maintain its strategic position in the Mid-Pacific and the Philippines, the spread of communism in that region will not directly threaten Western countries, as the results that the Soviet invasion of Central Asia or Europe could cause. Therefore, regarding the issue of obligations arising from the U.S. opposition to the expansion of communism, from a strategic point of view, the status of the Far East is clearly below that of the Middle East and Europe. The region's demand for U.S. aid must be large, but on the whole, it cannot enjoy priority. In fact, the Far East is indeed a region where the United States can limit its obligations when necessary.</p>
<p>South America</p>
<p>South America is the fifth important region to consider for future U.S. obligations. The situation here is also very different from other regions. The main difference is that South America is geographically farther from the Soviet Union, and it has political, geographical, and economic ties with the United States, and South America has not been ravaged by war, and there are no serious problems such as relief and recovery.</p>
<p>South America, especially the northern half of the region, is of great strategic and military-economic importance to the United States. Therefore, U.S. obligations in South America should be very large, but Americans have a sense of shared interests and mutual dependence. Most Americans feel that South America will not go to another path except to stand on the same front line as Western countries.</p>
<p>From a realistic point of view, although South America is very important to the United States, U.S. obligations in the region may be fundamentally limited when necessary. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Grand Ceremony on the Huangpu River: Military and Civilians Excitedly Celebrate the Receipt of Japanese Reparation Ships. Japanese Sailors Close Their Eyes and Lower Their Heads with Infinite Sadness</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The flag-raising ceremony for the first batch of eight Japanese reparation warships, including the "Yukikaze," was held at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Gaocangmiao Navy yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. The ceremony was solemn and grand, and the military and civilians were excited and enthusiastic. It was truly an unprecedented and glorious page in history.</p>
<p>Starting at 8:00 a.m., naval officers and soldiers and people from all walks of life arrived at the venue one after another, including Naval First Base Commander Fang Ying, Chief of the Ship Receiving Office of the Naval Headquarters Yang Daozhao, Navy Major Staff Officer Zhong Hanbo from the Mission to Japan, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Koesah, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee Fang Zhi, Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Bide, Garrison Commander Fu Zhengmo, Director of Jiangnan Shipyard Ma Deji, reporters from various newspapers, photographers from the Central Film Studio, naval colonels, and naval family members, totaling several hundred people. The "Yukikaze" was berthed at the Jiangnan Shipyard between the first and second docks, while the other seven ships were scattered in the center of the river. The command platform was set up on the shore, facing the "Yukikaze" at a distance of about 50 meters. The surroundings were filled with colorful naval signal flags. Two national flags were suspended on the left and right sides in front of the platform, and a white cloth banner was hung high on the left side of the platform, on which was written "Flag Raising Ceremony for Receiving Reparation Warships." Steel plate pontoons were laid from the command platform to the "Yukikaze," and various signal flags were also hung on both sides of the handrails of the gangway for boarding the ship. Fluttering in the wind, it was a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>At exactly 9:00 a.m., the ceremony began, and all participants took their positions. Starting from the command platform, the first row was for guests, followed by naval officers, naval soldiers, honor guards, and military bands. Ogata (formerly mistakenly identified as Okada) and Funayama, the foremen of the Japanese crew who sailed the ships to Shanghai, stood on the right side of the command platform, closing their eyes and lowering their heads, seemingly with infinite sadness. The remaining Japanese crew members remained on board the ships.</p>

<h3>Not Boasting Because of Receiving Reparations, But Sufficient to Prove That Justice Will Be Done—Speech by Chairman Fang, Commander—</h3>
<p>At 9:05 a.m., the music played, and after standing solemnly and singing the national anthem, Chairman Fang Ying, in an excited tone, spoke in front of the microphone. Fang pointed out that the foundation of human civilization lies in peace and mutual assistance. In the past, a few Japanese warlords disregarded public justice and harbored aggressive ambitions, thus causing World War II, but most Japanese people love peace. Now that the warlords have been overthrown, the Japanese people are moving towards the path of peace and democracy. A total of ninety-two warships are being paid to the Allied countries, divided into three batches. The first batch of thirty-two ships is divided into four groups, which were drawn by lot by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China drew the third group, totaling 10,040 tons. The second batch of eight ships will arrive in Shanghai in two weeks, and the third batch of seven ships will arrive in another two weeks. Finally, Fang said that those who harbor aggressive ambitions will inevitably lose more than they gain and suffer the consequences themselves. First, mankind must practice mutual assistance in order to avoid war and ensure lasting peace. We are not boasting about the reparation warships we received today as war trophies, but this fact is sufficient to confirm that justice will be done. Finally, Commander Fang expressed his admiration and gratitude for the close cooperation between the Allied Headquarters of General MacArthur and our mission to Japan, and for the sincere piloting of the reparation ships to Shanghai by the Japanese sailors.</p>
<h3>Melodious Music, National Flag Rising</h3>
<p>At 9:15 a.m., the master of ceremonies shouted "Lower the Japanese flag—" Officers, soldiers, and guests turned to face the "Yukikaze," and everyone was silent. Hundreds of pairs of eyes gathered on the sun flag on the top of the ship, regarding it as a symbol of Japanese imperialism, falling down. The joy in the hearts of hundreds of people was fully revealed in their expressions. Then the blue and red surrender flag was also taken down. At 9:20 a.m., the command platform shouted again "Raise the national flag." In the melodious music and the salute of all officers, soldiers, and guests, our blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag slowly rose and fluttered under the blue sky, seeming even more solemn and beautiful.</p>
<p>After the flag-raising ceremony, Japanese sailors Ogata, etc., presented the acceptance letter. This acceptance letter had already been signed by our representative in Japan. Now, it was formally signed by Commander Fang Ying to complete the formalities. Then, Committee Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Committee and Zhang Bide, the representative of Mayor Wu, were invited to speak. They all felt deeply honored by the ceremony, believing that it was the end of the Japanese warlords' aggression and the harvest of the Chinese people's love of justice and peace. They also hoped to strengthen naval construction and be vigilant against countries that still harbor aggressive ambitions and destroy peace in the world. Finally, the ceremony was completed with gun salutes and music.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Xuefeng Warship</h3>
<p>After the ceremony concluded at 9:40 AM, reporters boarded the "Xuefeng" warship for a tour. The ship is one of the largest destroyers of the eight received, weighing 2,490 tons. However, all the armaments had been removed, and the items on board gave a sense of disarray and dilapidation. The iron rails for transporting torpedoes at the stern were also heavily rusted. Re-equipping and renovating it would require considerable time. According to Director Yang of the Receiving Office, the new names for the ships have not yet been decided. For the time being, they will be distinguished by their tonnage as "Receiving No. 1" to "Receiving No. 8" to transport naval equipment received from various locations for assembly. After completion, the official names will be announced, along with the selection of the captains.</p>
<p>Additionally, the "Wakataka" warship, which escorted the eight ships to Shanghai, set sail to return to Japan at 11:00 AM after the receiving ceremony, carrying all the Japanese crew. Our liaison officer, Major Zhong Hanbo, and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Kosha also accompanied the ship to Japan to prepare for escorting the second batch of warships to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Commendation of Loyal Souls and Public Burial to be Held - Our Special Plane to Welcome - Yang Guangzheng's Remains - Today Arriving Directly in Nanjing from Manila - Ashes of Zhu Shaoping and Others to be Returned Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Our country's former Consul General in Manila, Yang Guangzheng (see photo), due to his efforts in mobilizing overseas Chinese to raise funds in Manila during the War of Resistance to assist the motherland in resisting the enemy, was unfortunately killed by Japanese invaders on April 17th of the 31st year of the Republic.

The overseas Chinese in Manila will hold a grand "July 7th" memorial service today, during which a farewell ceremony for Yang's remains will be held before being respectfully sent to the airport.</p>
<p>Our City Schedules a Memorial Service</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Continental Newspaper, Hu She, World Society, Arctic Company, China Ren Society General Headquarters, and Tsinghua Alumni Association, among other organizations, recently organized a preparatory committee for a memorial service at the Tsinghua Alumni Association in the Citibank Building. After discussions between committee members Qi Yunqing, Zhang Guoxun, Xu Zhendong, Lu Meiseng, and Yang's family, it was decided to hold a memorial service at the Wu Liande Hall of the Asia Literary Society on Museum Road at 5:00 PM on the 10th of this month to comfort the loyal soul and express condolences. They also plan to establish a political lecture series at Yang's alma mater, Tsinghua University, to commemorate him permanently, and all donations received will be used to fund the lecture series.</p>
<p>Young, Handsome, and Held Important Positions</p>
<p>The following is a description of Yang's career:</p>
<p>Yang Guangzheng, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, was born in Shanghai in the 11th year before the Republic of China (1900 AD). At the age of fifteen, he was admitted to Tsinghua School. After graduating five years later, he went to the United States and was admitted to Colorado University. After obtaining a bachelor's degree, he continued his studies at Princeton University, earning a master's and doctoral degree in political economics. He was only twenty-four years old at the time.</p>
<p>In 1924, he served as a secretary at the Chinese Embassy in the United States and attended the Geneva Opium Conference. In 1926, he returned to China and served as a professor at Tsinghua University. In the winter of 1927, he served as an assistant in the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and concurrently as the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, taking over the Beijing English Special Report and founding the China French Magazine.</p>
<p>Attended the Coronation of the British Monarch</p>
<p>In 1929, he married Ms. Yan Youyun, from the prominent Yan family of Cixi. After their honeymoon, he served as the Consul General in London. After three years, he was reassigned as the Director of the Chinese Information Office at the League of Nations. In 1933, he was recalled to China by Song Ziwen and founded the World Telegraph Agency, with branches in Geneva, Paris, and other places. He also served as the Foreign Affairs Inspection Commissioner for the five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan. In 1935, he took over the Continental Newspaper as General Manager and Editor-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Unyielding and Tragically Killed</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, he was ordered to remain overseas to carry out foreign propaganda and was subsequently transferred to serve as the Consul General in the Philippines. At that time, he launched a campaign to raise funds from overseas Chinese, obtaining 22 million Philippine pesos to donate to the country. After the fall of Manila, the Japanese invaders forced Yang to raise 24 million Philippine pesos for the Japanese army's military expenses, but Yang resolutely refused, leading to his and his staff's tragic death at the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>Yang's wife, Ms. Yan, and her children are currently residing in New York. Ms. Yan is currently employed by the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Bail for Service Method - Postponed to Resume Next Year</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Before the war, there was a method of bail for service in the courts, that is, after a prisoner was detained for a certain period, he could apply for a ruling for bail for service. This method was suspended during the War of Resistance and was originally scheduled to resume on July 1st of this year. The judicial organs of this city recently received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to postpone it for six months and resume the bail for service method from New Year's Day next year.</p>

<h3>Arrested Students' Families - Request Re-trial Again - Supplemented Opinions Opposing Application of Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Reporters learned from the families of arrested students yesterday that after the families of the students arrested on the 25th of last month applied to the High Court for a retrial of the arrested students, the High Court sent a letter to the city government for inquiry. The city government then replied that the arresting agency was the Garrison Headquarters. The High Court then sent a letter to inquire with the Garrison Headquarters. The families recently supplemented their opinions, requesting the High Court to promptly conduct a retrial. The original statement listed five reasons, strongly opposing the application of martial law, and requested the High Court to conduct a retrial within 24 hours according to the law.</p>
<h3>The Navy Authorities - Investigated and Returned - Fuxing Island and Land - Owned by the Dredging Bureau</h3>
<p>After the victory, the Navy Headquarters, in order to meet urgent needs, had designated all the land and buildings owned by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau on Fuxing Island, which had fallen into enemy hands, for use as a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Fuxing Island is located in the middle section of this port, north of Yangshupu, and was originally a channel of the Huangpu River! It was formed into an island by the Dredging Bureau through the consolidation of waterways and land reclamation. Except for a small portion, the land on the island is owned by the Bureau, which established a civil engineering construction site on the island as an important base for guiding the engineering of the Huangpu River, on a grand scale. The naval authorities, considering that the Bureau is a water conservancy engineering organization in our country, and that the island's construction site could not be recovered for use, fearing that it would affect dredging and port affairs, it is now learned that General Commander Gui Yongqing has ordered the Commander of the First Base Area in Shanghai to investigate and return the portion of the property in the Fuxing Island camp that belongs to the Bureau, in order to facilitate the advancement of dredging work. It is also learned that the handover procedures between the two parties were completed on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Direct Telegraph Line Added Between Shanghai and Manila</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station and the Globe Wireless Telegraph Company simultaneously announced that, in addition to the original direct telegraph circuit between the International Radio Station Shanghai and the Globe Company San Francisco, they have now obtained the approval of our country's Ministry of Communications, the U.S. Communications Commission, and the Philippine government, and will officially add a direct telegraph circuit between the International Radio Station and the Globe Company Manila at 9:00 AM today (the 7th).</p>
<p>The Globe Company's Manila branch is equipped with a self-made, state-of-the-art high-speed telegraph typewriter that can transmit over a hundred words per minute, day and night, directly to San Francisco and New York. It is said that the speed and accuracy of this machine are far superior to those of other telegraph typewriters. The International Radio Station's Shanghai-San Francisco circuit is currently preparing to refit with this new machine.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Shipyard Workers - Petition with Five Demands</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy had 5,000 workers last year. Starting in April of this year, due to a shortage of funds, lack of materials, and inability to carry out large-scale work, the number of workers was gradually reduced to over 2,000. Yesterday, some of the shipyard's workers took advantage of the weekly holiday to launch a march and petition, demanding five points: (1) Subsidize shipbuilding funds, (2) Expedite the allocation of US$500,000 in foreign exchange, (3) Guarantee employment, (4) Resume work, (5) Oppose shift changes.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Official Xu Jinyuan - Prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office</h3>

<h3>The Damachang Airport's Enclosed Land - To Be Collected by the Baoshan County Government</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Wenbin, a city councilor from the Damachang district, and Li Yanggao, the chairman of the district people's representative assembly, recently wrote to Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau, stating that the Damachang district has been taken over by the municipal government and requesting that the collection and return procedures for the land enclosed by the Damachang Airport be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Director Zhu replied that the Land Administration Bureau had sent personnel to contact the Binshan County Government this year, because the Damachang base was originally within the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, and the land registration books had not yet been taken over. At that time, County Chief Cheng stated that the county government had submitted a request to the higher authorities to handle the collection. The Land Administration Bureau then submitted the contact process to the municipal government for approval. Later, the municipal government instructed that since the procedures had already been handled by the Baoshan County Government, there was no need to repeat them in order to avoid duplication. As for the boundary demarcation issue, it will be handled separately. Although the Ministry of Interior has convened two meetings, the boundary demarcation has not yet been finalized. Realistic Bandit-Catching Exercise - Solving the Case is as Easy as Turning One's Hand</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 11:00 AM yesterday, the Songshan Police Sub-bureau received a phone report stating that there was a robbery at No. 56 Dakang Lane, Jianguo Road. Sub-bureau Chief Song Tingjun personally led the criminal investigation section chief Shen Zuoluo and all the volunteer police and judicial section police officers to pursue the bandits by car. However, the bandits had already fled far away. According to the victim, the two bandits were both armed with handguns. One was wearing a white Hong Kong shirt and shorts, with a straw hat. The other was wearing a Xiangyunsha shirt and pants. After the robbery, they fled along South Tibet Road. Sub-bureau Chief Song immediately ordered a chase. Arriving at the scene, they saw no trace of the bandits, then turned to the Fuxing Middle Road Caishi Road intersection and asked a traveling car dealership if anyone had hired a car. The dealership replied that two people with such attire had arrived and hired a car to go west. The car was sent back to the dealership, and according to the driver's report, the two passengers got out of the car at the Da Hu Hotel near Dongxin Bridge and went inside. They then went to the hotel and found the two bandits in a room on the second floor, arrested them, and confiscated their weapons and stolen goods, bringing them back to the bureau together. From the time the case was reported to the time it was solved, it took only about forty minutes. It turned out to be a bandit-catching exercise.</p>
<h3>Fire on Wenzhou Road - Young Woman Injured Jumping from Building</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A fire broke out at the Dongya Shangguang Factory at No. 4, Lane 109, Wenzhou Road at around 1:54 PM yesterday, destroying all the goods piled up downstairs. At that time, a young woman, Wu Song, was in the small room upstairs. In a panic, she jumped out of the building and injured her left foot. She was later sent to Hongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Public Bus - Improvement - Ventilation - Equipment - Installation Already Completed - Joining Lines in Operation</h3>
<p>Regarding the Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee's improvement of ventilation equipment on public buses, the committee has been proceeding separately with: (1) Two louvered windows are being manufactured on both sides of the original front windows at the front of each bus. All of them can be opened on sunny days to absorb air, and after closing on rainy days, air can still pass through the louvers. (2) The upper half of the windows on both sides of the bus body are now changed to open downwards, so as not to block the windows after passengers are seated. (3) The committee has also stationed service personnel at the main stations to discourage passengers from boarding the bus without restrictions, as reducing passenger density effectively increases air circulation.</p>
<p>The committee has completed the modification of car No. 448 and others, which are now operating on Line 3 and are indeed effective. In addition, the committee has lengthened the bodies of the T2, T3, and T4 Dodge cars and remanufactured them into formal public buses with aluminum skin bodies. Another twenty-five vehicles were completed a few days ago. It was originally planned to open Line 12 with them, but now, in order to divert congestion on various lines, it has been decided to first join the original lines in operation. The opening date of Line 12 will be decided after the new cars under construction are completed.</p>
<h3>Duanmu Kai's Legal Perspective: A Step Closer to Democracy After the Current Government Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its fourteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the China Broadcasting Station, inviting renowned lawyer Duanmu Kai to speak on "Looking at the Current Government from a Legal Perspective." The following is a summary of his speech:</p>
<p>Recently, the government underwent a reorganization characterized by two features: (1) In addition to the existing Kuomintang, the China Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party also participated. In the National Government Committee, there are National Government Committee members from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. In the Executive Yuan, there are political affairs committee members from both parties, and two ministers from the Youth Party. In the Legislative Yuan, there are legislators from both parties. Although individuals from the two parties have not yet participated in the Judicial, Control, and Examination Yuans, this does not affect the significance of this government reorganization. (2) This government reorganization implements a responsible cabinet system, with the Executive Yuan directly responsible to the National Government Committee. This system is not without precedent in European and American political history, but there are also differences. For example, the United Kingdom had coalition cabinets of various parties during wartime, but these required parliamentary approval. In France, due to the small size of the parties, almost no single party could form a cabinet alone. Each cabinet was composed of several parties and also required parliamentary approval. In the United States, although the Republican Party recruited individuals into the cabinet during wartime, they were only responsible to President Roosevelt personally, while the Democratic Party was responsible to Congress regarding the government. China's Executive Yuan being responsible to the National Government Committee is slightly different.</p>
<p>Three Stages of Revolution</p>
<p>Since the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang has implemented a one-party dictatorship, up until this reorganization. When we study the reasons for its one-party dictatorship, there are three bases: (1) Theoretical basis: The Kuomintang is the party that created the Republic of China, and its sole purpose is to create a democratic country. However, the people of a democratic country must have the skills and knowledge to exercise democracy in their habits and political cultivation. People initially liberated from an autocratic system lack this quality. Therefore, President Sun divided the revolution into three stages: A. Military government period, B. Tutelage period, C. Constitutional government period. First, military force is used to clear obstacles to the revolution's future. Then, during the Tutelage period, a provisional constitution is promulgated to train people to have a deep understanding of democracy, and only then can the Constitutional government period be effectively entered. Therefore, one-party tutelage is a necessary stage of the revolution.</p>
<p>Lessons from Facts, Legal Basis</p>
<p>(2) Factual basis: After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang once transferred power to Yuan Shikai. During that period, Yuan proclaimed himself emperor, there was a restoration of the monarchy, the parliament was dissolved, and warlords carved up the country, experiencing countless sufferings. After the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic, it was clearly realized that political power could not be handed over casually, allowing reactionaries to take the opportunity to diminish the revolutionary movement. Therefore, the one-party dictatorship was not relaxed in the slightest, which is indeed a lesson from reality. (3) Legal basis: According to Article 30 of the Provisional Constitution, "During the Tutelage period, the National Congress of the Kuomintang shall exercise the central ruling power on behalf of the National Congress." Therefore, the ruling power of the National Government is granted by the Provisional Constitution and cannot be changed. Unless the constitution is completed, the constitution is promulgated and implemented, and the Provisional Constitution naturally ceases; or the National Assembly re-amends the Provisional Constitution, there is no other way to change it. This is the legal basis for the one-party dictatorship.</p>
<p>How to Explain the Three-Party Government?</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang has implemented a one-party dictatorship, how can the formation of a three-party coalition government before the implementation of party politics be explained? First, although the Kuomintang practices a one-party dictatorship, it only employs people based on talent and ability. In the past, not only were there many non-party members participating in government work as administrative officials, but there were also many as political officials. Since the Kuomintang is entrusted by the people to form a government, the participation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties in the government has been agreed by the Kuomintang and must also be agreed by the people. Second, although there are more than two parties, there must be one party that takes the lead. Even in Western multi-party cabinets, there can only be one prime minister, and one party must bear more responsibility. The current government of China is still led by the Kuomintang, which also bears more responsibility. This does not hinder the Provisional Constitution.</p>
<p>A Renewed Impression at Home and Abroad</p>
<p>Our impression of this government reorganization can be summarized as taking a step closer to democracy. In terms of the evolution of the National Government, it can be called a one-power system when it was first established, with the chairman of the National Government directly exercising the five powers of legislation, administration, judiciary, supervision, and examination. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the five Yuans were separated, but this was a division of labor, not a division of power. After the September 18th Incident in the twenty-first year of the Republic, the five Yuans were directly responsible to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. This was a change from division of labor to division of power, and the changes gradually moved towards democracy. However, one-party dictatorship is difficult for the people to understand, no matter how hard the efforts. Therefore, there are new measures for this government reorganization. The possible impacts of this reorganization are threefold: (1) It shows that the Kuomintang is willing to open up political power. (2) Any party, as long as it is a legal activity, is allowed by the government. (3) Politics is practical experience. The Kuomintang's dictatorship for more than ten years has prevented people from other parties from engaging in politics. This government reorganization allows people outside the Kuomintang to gain experience in practical politics. Therefore, after this government reorganization, there is a renewed impression at home and abroad, and we evaluate it as "taking a step closer to democracy."</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Car Accident: Police Officer Couple Injured, One Dead</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhong Min, 23, from Guangdong, the captain of the mobile brigade of the Municipal Police Department on Jianguo West Road, was riding a three-wheeled motorized bicycle with his wife, Wu Guanghua, at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, traveling west to east on Gaoping Road. A China National Aviation Corporation car with the license plate number 33124 was speeding towards them and crashed into them because they failed to evade, overturning their vehicle. Wu's head was crushed on the spot, and she was barely breathing. Zhong was injured in the right buttock. The car fled the scene. Later, a passerby reported the incident to the mobile brigade, which, together with the Changshu Police Department, dispatched officers to the scene.

<h3>Retired Youth Army Lays Down to Block Train</h3>
<p>At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, more than sixty students from Jiaxing Middle School (i.e., retired Youth Army) including Zhou Bo and Zou Zhiming, who were specially trained by the Cadre Training Office of the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from Jiaxing by military train. They immediately jumped onto the FP726 first-class carriage of the Jinghu 8th Express Train, which was parked on the sixth platform of the North Station, preventing passengers who had purchased tickets from boarding. Captain Hong of the station's military police company went to persuade them, but was refused, and the two sides stood in stalemate for more than half an hour. The students then lay down on the tracks to prevent the train from heading west. In order to maintain traffic and protect the interests of passengers, the Railway Bureau was forced to have the railway police and military police pull all the students lying on the tracks off the platform, and the 8th train was able to depart, but it was delayed by more than an hour. In order to alleviate their economic difficulties, the Railway Bureau added a third-class carriage to the 58th train to Nanjing at 5:00 p.m. to send the sixty-odd retired students back to their hometown, and the dispute was resolved.</p>

<h3>Ebbs Company Gold Note Case: Macebow Appeals to the Supreme Court: Four Main Points of Reasoning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the case of Dutch national Macebow disrupting finance, the High Court previously sentenced him to one year in prison and confiscated US$65,369.71 and HK$20,000. Macebow refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. The main points of his reasons for the appeal are as follows: (1) When the appellant was arrested on March 3 of this year and the foreign currency of the American Ebbs Company was seized, there was no law in China punishing the buying and selling of foreign currency. (2) The Chinese government's "Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency" became law on February 27 of this year, but according to the regulations on the effective date of laws promulgated on December 23 of the 21st year of the Republic, the above-mentioned measures had not become law in Shanghai on the date when the appellant was arrested and the foreign currency of Ebbs Company was seized. (3) Ebbs Company is not a bank, so the appellant cannot be regarded as a bank manager. Ebbs Company is engaged in the business of selling and trading TTDD foreign exchange and has never accepted any deposits of any kind. The deposit of HK$20,000 paid by the Lei Da Company to Ebbs Company and the US$40,000 security deposit recovered by Ebbs Company from a third party are not bank deposits. (4) The original judgment confiscated a total of US$65,369.71 and HK$20,000. Even if the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency should be effective, the part of the original judgment that confiscated the money is still confused.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Education and Culture</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Qian Xieqing (1) Graduates of enemy and puppet schools must participate in the examination; otherwise, they will not be allowed to apply for university entrance exams, nor may they participate in university entrance exams with equivalent academic qualifications. (2) Those who participate in university entrance exams with equivalent academic qualifications must meet the following two conditions: A. Completed two years of high school (non-enemy and puppet schools), B. Suspended from school for more than one year. Nanjing is currently handling the final examination. Graduates of enemy and puppet schools in Shanghai who have not participated in the examination can request the Municipal Education Bureau to entrust the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau to conduct the examination on their behalf.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Zhang Zhicheng (1) Graduates of unregistered schools are not allowed to participate in university entrance exams. (2) There is no other remedy besides the school completing the registration procedures.</p>
<h3>Postal Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>[Regulations] (1) This column is published every Monday and answered by the Public Service Group of the Post Office. (2) Letters to this column are limited to questions related to various departments of the Post Office and related to the public. (3) Please indicate "Postal Affairs" in the upper left corner of the envelope to avoid paying postage. (4) Letters should be sent to the Public Service Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration or forwarded by this</p>
<p>Newspaper's "Social Service" column.</p>
<p>This bureau has received inquiries from (1) Mr. Wen Shaowei, Xinzha Road, (2) Mr. Wang Erling, Shengze Dongbaiyang (3) Mr. Ru Xin of Shanghai (4) Ms. Zhu Yunping, Hankou Road, and (5) Mr. Chao Zixing, Wujin Taicheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory. We will briefly answer the points raised below:</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) (A) "Postage stamps that have been announced as abolished by the Post Office may be exchanged for new stamps from the postal authority within six months from the date of abolition" (Article 10 of the Postal Law). Other than that, once postage stamps are sold, they will not be redeemed or exchanged to prevent abuses. This is based on the provisions of Article 136 of the Postal Rules. (B) Large-denomination postage stamps you mentioned can be used permanently unless there is an order to abolish them.</p>
<p>(2) (A) The Nanyang region is vast, and the distance from Shanghai varies. The time required for postal transportation is also different. For example, it takes about ten days by airmail to send to Batavia or Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies, and about three weeks by land and sea. It takes only five or six days by airmail to send to Singapore or Penang, and about sixteen days by land and sea. We are not sure where you are referring to when you say Nanyang. (B) Postal recruitment is always announced in newspapers, and the qualifications are also stated in the announcement. There will be no examinations held in the near future. (C) Pingliang Road is in District 19, and Wuchang Road is in District 5 east of Zha Pu Road, and District 0 west of it.</p>
<p>(3) Mail sent to Surabaya, Java, and land and sea mail is transported directly to Surabaya or Batavia. If there are no ships that go directly to Java, they will be taken to Singapore or Hong Kong for transit. Airmail is sent by plane to Hong Kong for delivery. If there are China National Aviation Corporation planes flying to Calcutta, then they will be transferred from Calcutta. The Shanghai-Calcutta route is the fastest, but it is only once a week (sealed and sent on Fridays). For the rest, please refer to the previous question.</p>
<p>(4) (A) Clothing and daily necessities can be sent as small packages, but the cloth clothing must first be inspected by the customs. (B) Small packages are limited to one kilogram and calculated in units of one hundred centimeters. Currently, the postage for small packages to Anhui is 1,131 yuan per hundred centimeters. (C) Small packages can be sent to postal agencies for delivery. (5) (A) A minimum deposit of 1,000 yuan in national currency is required to open a postal savings account. (B) You should be able to withdraw money at any time with your account book, but you must leave at least 1,000 yuan. (C) The interest rate is 1% per week, calculated daily.</p>
<p>Postal Proxy</p>
<p>To Mr. Yang Yunbo: I have received your letter. The Yishe in this area is at No. 16, Lane 153, South Huangpi Road (Beile Road), Chinese Chess Association. There are many famous masters in the club. You can also play chess at the Pinfang Tea House, which is diagonally opposite the Pudong Wenxiang Association on Zhongzheng Middle Road, but it is of a lesser quality than the Chinese Chess Association.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Industrial College of Jiangsu Province Enrolls New Students in Four Departments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou News] Suzhou Industrial College of Jiangsu Province was founded in the first year of the Republic of China and has a long history. Various workshops and laboratories are well-equipped. During the Anti-Japanese War, it suffered major damage. After the war, the person in charge of the school tried every possible means to resume classes in Shanghai. After the victory, the province ordered it to move back to Suzhou, and Deng Bangyao was still in charge and actively expanding the school. It is reported that this summer, the school's textile, mechanical, civil engineering, and architecture departments are all recruiting new students, and it is expected that the number of applicants will be quite large.</p>
<h3>Yu Shangyuan Will Not Participate in the Drama Experts Meeting; It is Reported That the Issue of Travel Expenses to the Meeting Has Become an Obstacle</h3>
<p>UNESCO Secretary-General Huxley previously sent letters to the Minister of Education of China and Yu Shangyuan, inviting Yu to participate in the "Drama Experts Meeting" organized by the organization as an expert. The meeting is scheduled to be held in Paris starting on the 28th of this month. Its main task is to discuss assisting the drama revival and development of countries ravaged by the Nazis and to prepare for the establishment of the "International Drama Society." Mr. Yu immediately followed the instructions of the other party and sent letters to solicit the opinions of the main figures of Chinese drama. He also disclosed the documents sent by the other party in the newspaper. After collecting them, he sent the "Proposal" on June 19 for inclusion in the agenda. The main points of the proposal are to hope to set up a "Far East Branch of the International Drama Society" in China and to donate and build experimental theaters, drama libraries, and museums in Nanjing and other places. It is now known that regarding Mr. Yu's travel expenses, the other party only bears half of the round-trip travel expenses to France and the living expenses during the meeting, estimated at about 500 US dollars. According to the investigation, this trip requires about 3,000 US dollars (Mr. Dong Shouyi's trip to Europe to participate in the Olympic Games was subsidized by the Chinese government to this amount). It was recently reported that the Ministry of Education can only subsidize Mr. Yu 1,000 US dollars, and the difference of 1,500 US dollars is twice the actual need, so it is impossible to make the trip in reality.</p>
<h3>Tuition Increase in Beiping City Next Semester; The Number of Students Dropping Out of School Will Increase Dramatically; Students from Private Universities are Making Plans to Stop School and Find Employment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Due to the increase in tuition fees for universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Beiping City next semester, the number of students dropping out of school will increase dramatically. Although the tuition fees of private schools have not yet been determined, it is estimated that universities will be around 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, middle schools will also be between 300,000 and 500,000 yuan, and primary schools will be around 300,000 yuan. Therefore, after the municipal or national schools began to enroll and register, the crowding of applicants was unprecedented. On average, each municipal middle school will only recruit 200 new students, while the number of applicants reaches 5,000 to 6,000. Despite the rain all day, the number of applicants has not decreased slightly. The number of applicants in one day has exceeded the total number of applicants in previous years. Those who apply for the second grade of municipal junior high schools do not hesitate to move back one year to apply for the first grade. On the registration certificates, there are many "verified" stamps of four or five schools. According to middle school students studying in private schools, the cost of accommodation and meals will not be less than 2 million yuan next semester. Most schools must pay all at once before the start of the semester. This is not something that ordinary families can afford. The accumulated letters of solicitation by the principals of each municipal primary and secondary school are quite impressive. Students from private universities anticipate the difficulties of the future, and some of them are making plans to stop school and find employment. However, due to the large number of unemployed people, finding employment is not easy. There are also many students in the second, third, and fourth grades who are preparing to re-enroll in the first grade of national universities. The situation is even worse for those whose families are in the communist area and have cut off assistance. The Beiping Education Bureau originally planned to increase schools and increase class sizes next semester, but due to financial difficulties, almost all of them cannot be realized.</p>
<h3>Ge Peigen Hosts Electric Teaching Experimental Class</h3>
<p>China Film and Photographic Equipment Supply Company, Room 603, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, is using the summer vacation to establish a "Film Teaching Experimental Class" to promote film teaching.

Teachers from various schools who wish to participate can send a letter from the principal. It is completely free.</p>
<h3>Mingde Girls' School in South Shanghai</h3>
<p>New School Building Completed</p>
<p>Tuition Reduced by Half</p>
<p>The three-story new school building of the private Mingde Girls' Primary and Secondary School in Shanghai, located at its original site in Huajinfang, Huajin Road, South Shanghai, has been fully completed. In addition to classrooms and offices, it now has laboratories, music rooms, workshops, libraries, and a grand auditorium, all fully equipped. The school has decided that starting next semester, in addition to continuing operations at the old site at 688 Linsen Road, the South Shanghai branch will first resume its kindergarten, primary school, and junior high school levels. The junior high school will exclusively enroll girls, while the other levels will be co-educational. Furthermore, given the post-war social and economic decline and the lack of recovery of prosperity in South Shanghai, the school fears that parents will be unable to bear the tuition fees according to the standard fees set by private schools. As there are only two municipal girls' high schools in the city with relatively low fees and limited enrollment, which cannot meet the actual demand, the school has decided to reduce tuition fees as much as possible in order to popularize girls' education and take into account the burden on parents, halving the fees according to the standards set by private schools, in line with the original intention of establishing the school.</p>
<h3>Dajing Middle School Building New Dormitories</h3>

<h3>Oriental Economic Library to Officially Open Today; Director Tao Xisheng Received the Press for a Visit Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Oriental Economic Library, which has been in preparation for many years, is now ready and will officially open today. Director Tao Xisheng and Deputy Director Lin Side of the library received members of the press in the city for a visit yesterday. Initiators such as Du Yuesheng, Li Fuxun, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, and Qin Runqing believe that economic research is of utmost importance at the beginning of national construction, and that the lack of an economic library in Shanghai, the economic center of the country, is a serious deficiency. They therefore reorganized the books received as enemy and traitor property after the victory, and widely collected and cited materials to complete this pioneering undertaking. The library collects more than 200,000 volumes on economics, doctrines, history, geography, events, institutions, policies, technologies, narratives, and various valuable historical materials. Among them, Japanese books account for about 60%, and the remaining 40% is equally divided between Chinese and Western languages. The Japanese have always paid great attention to economic surveys in our country, and during the war, they carried out systematic economic research in their occupied areas. Currently, the Oriental Economic Library has a portion of unfinished works by the Japanese, which are awaiting further research and completion by the Chinese. The library's reading regulations stipulate that reading hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily, with holidays, the following day, and Mondays closed. All visitors to the library need to purchase a "reading ticket" at a cost of 1,000 legal tender per ticket, valid for the day. The library is located at 523 Yuguo Road in this city. Readers who find it inconvenient due to distance can have meals in the library.</p>
<h3>Oriental Economic Research Institute Establishes Scholarships</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Oriental Research Institute, a new organization engaged in research on China's economic construction after the victory, is headed by Tao Xisheng. Recently, in order to promote academic research and reward talent, it has established scholarships. Any students in their third or fourth year of study in the departments of economics, business administration, agriculture, accounting, or statistics at accredited universities, whose grades are in the top four and have proof, can apply. It is stipulated that 500,000 yuan will be issued per person per semester, but they must work at the institute for two years after graduation. It has now been decided to start with universities in the capital.</p>
<h3>The Only Institution of Higher Learning in Luoyang: Jiaozuo Institute of Technology</h3>
<p>— Fan Hong, Our Correspondent in Luoyang</p>
<p>Leaving Luoyang City, crossing the Luo River, and heading south along the Luonan Highway, after traveling about fifteen li, one can see a large area of cypress groves surrounded by red walls. This is one of Luoyang's famous historical sites - the Guan Di Forest. Immediately to the east of the Guan Di Forest, with a small lake at the entrance, surrounded by desolate and miserable gray soil and broken walls, appears particularly deserted. This is the location of the only institution of higher learning in Luoyang today: the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, abbreviated as Jiaogong, was originally located in Jiaozuo, northern Henan, famous for its coal production along the Daoging Railway Line. Later, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and in 1937, when the enemy reached Anyang, Jiaogong moved to Xi'an. In 1938, it moved again to Tianshui, Gansu. In July, it was ordered to merge with the Engineering College of National Northwest Associated University and the Engineering College of National Northeast University to form the National Northwest Institute of Technology, located in Guluba, Chenggu, Shaanxi. In October 1945, it was approved to restore the school. Since Jiaozuo was occupied by the Communist army and suffered severe damage, making it impossible to move back, it was agreed to use the old wounded soldier hospital in the Guan Di Forest of Luoyang as a temporary school site, and enrollment and classes began in October 1946. Thanks to the painstaking efforts of President Zhang Qinglian over the past year, although the facilities in various departments are simple, they have all stepped onto the right track, restoring the old appearance of the past, and creating the foundation for an institution of higher learning in Luoyang. We cannot help but congratulate western Henan, the mining industry, and our fellow students!</p>
<p>Jiaogong currently has about 160 students in the two departments of mining and metallurgy, as well as the preparatory class, distributed in more than 100 empty rooms and a courtyard of dozens of acres, which is quite comfortable and compact. Most of the professors are the original veterans, which new schools cannot catch up with.</p>
<p>Students get up at 5:00 AM every day, and classes start at 8:00 AM. According to the timetable, they attend seven or eight classes in a row to complete the day's tasks. At night, oil lamps illuminate the classrooms and dormitories, and everywhere there is diligent thought, with pens and brushes constantly scratching. The quiet air is a bit stifling, almost the opposite of the situation when reading English every morning. After class, or on Saturdays, or after an exam, there are not many fans on the sports field. Most go to the streets to stroll, sit in tea houses. The streets in the Guan Di Forest have become increasingly desolate recently. Only the quiet tea houses, a bit like the south, cannot help but make people think of the southern country, especially when the sun sets and the breeze stirs the green shade, making people linger.</p>
<p>Students not only have a good reading atmosphere and a regular life, but also get along well with each other. Although they come from thousands of miles away and have slightly different accents, the harmonious atmosphere is always maintained thoroughly. There are no disputes, let alone fights, which saves the training staff a lot of work.</p>
<p>Almost every afternoon, they go to the Longmen Coal Mine, ten li away, for practice. This regular procession attracts the attention of the nearby people, making them aware that living in a university is not just about eating idle rice and putting on airs.</p>
<p>However, it is regrettable that the library is too empty, the extracurricular activities are too quiet, the experimental equipment has not been shipped back, and the exams are not free from being a joke. We cannot blame Jiaogong; very few schools in the country are not guilty of these problems. Therefore, we can only seek spiritual gain and victory.</p>
<p>Jiaogong was founded on March 1, three years before the founding of the Republic of China, initially by the British Fu Company to fulfill a contract, and was named the Jiaozuo Railway and Mining School. In 1915, the Zhongyuan Company was established and jointly operated with the Fu Company, renaming it the Fu Zhong Mining School. In 1919, it was renamed the Fu Zhong Mining College, offering specialized undergraduate courses. In 1921, adapting to the school system, it was renamed the Fu Zhong Mining University. In 1926, the Fu Company ceased operations, and the Zhongyuan Company provided all the funding. In 1931, it was renamed the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology, adding a civil engineering department. In 1933, it was ordered to change the department into a faculty. Currently, the Fu Zhong Company subsidizes 20 million yuan per month (in the past few months, it was 10 million yuan), and the Minsheng Coal Mining Company and the Longmen Coal Mining Bureau each subsidize 1% of coal production. Together with subsidies from the provincial government, the Ministry of Education, and other sources, it can reach more than 30 million yuan per month. After deducting expenses of more than 20 million yuan, there is still a small surplus, and the future development is very optimistic.</p>
<p>This semester has already ended, and 100 new students for this year will be enrolled in Luoyang and Kaifeng on August 5th and 6th respectively. Unfortunately, because the school site is small, the preparatory class will not be continued this year, and the classes in each department are limited and cannot be expanded. In fact, it will make thousands of high school graduates long for it, with no way to advance.</p>
<p>Graduates of Jiaogong are almost all over every corner of the country, especially in the Huainan Coal Mine, Jiaozuo Coal Mine, Minsheng Coal Mine, Longmen Coal Mine, and Yiluo Coal Mine, which are all the achievements of Jiaogong alumni.</p>
<p>Currently, schools across the country are making a fuss about various issues, such as strikes, sending representatives to the capital to petition, and holding meetings. Only Yugong is quietly far away in the Guan Di Forest, fifteen li outside Luoyang City, peacefully avoiding this storm. This is not only the blessing of the school's faculty, staff, and students, but also the blessing of western Henan! I wish Jiaogong eternal life, strength, and prosperity!</p>

<h3>Wimbledon Championships End; American Players Reach the Pinnacle; Win Four and a Half of the Five Major Titles</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Wimbledon, 5th] At this year's Wimbledon Tennis Championships, American athletes showed irresistible momentum, surpassing the achievements of 1938 and 1937. The United States won four of the five championships, and also made it into one mixed doubles final.</p>
<p>[United Press, Wimbledon, 5th] Today, the sky is low and windy, representing the English summer. On the closing day of Wimbledon, 20,000 spectators attended, including Queen Mary, Prime Minister Attlee, and US Ambassador to the UK Douglas. The women's doubles final created a huge upset, with Miss Hard and Mrs. Duthie defeating last year's champions Miss Brough and Miss Osborne 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. In the women's singles final, Miss Osborne defeated Miss Hard 6-2, 6-4. In the men's doubles final, to everyone's surprise, the "hope of the British Empire," young players Mottram and Sidwell of Australia, lost to Americans Kramo and Fogenburg 8-6, 6-3, 6-3. Today was a great day for America, winning all the championships and half of the mixed doubles. Australian Brownwich and American Miss Brough defeated Australian Langer and South African Mrs. Bowalton 1-6, 6-4, 6-2. Most of the tennis performances today were of extremely high standard. Even Queen Mary, at the age of 80, was very interested and sat for a long time. After the women's doubles match, Duthie and Hard went to the royal box, where they received two bouquets of flowers each from Queen Mary and the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, wearing a white hat and scarlet dress, personally presented the silver cup for the women's singles champion to Miss Osborne, a veteran from California. In the men's singles final, Kramo and Fogenburg entered the arena in gray velvet jackets amidst cheers, breaking the tradition of wearing white jackets.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 5th] Osborne, a 30-year-old veteran from California, became the new tennis champion, defeating Hard, a 22-year-old student at the University of Miami, Florida, 6-2, 6-4. In this way, both the men's and women's Wimbledon champions in 1947 were from California. Kramo is also from California. Perhaps because of the competition in the central arena, the game did not reach the highest standard, revealing nervousness. Hard's usually steady ball play was out of order today. The men's doubles, on the other hand, featured many wonderful shots. In the women's doubles final, Hard and Duthie's victory over Osborne and Brough was very thrilling. In fact, after each winning a set 3-6, 6-4, Osborne and Brough led 5-3 in the third set, and Brough was serving, "40-0." Hard and Duthie saved three points in a row to escape danger, and then won three consecutive games to win the championship, which can be said to be very fortunate. In the Fruit Plate Challenge, Mrs. Jerzykowski of Poland defeated Britain's Blair Heaven 6-6-1, 7-5 to retain the championship. In the men's singles final, Stad of South Africa defeated Mottram of Britain 6-3, 6-3.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Finals Produce an Upset; Green Team Defeats Hualian</h3>
<p>Tonight, Post A Faces Hualianhua</p>
<p>The seventh match of the second Table Tennis League Finals was held at the Central Assembly Hall at 8:00 PM the night before last. Hualian, the champion of the third division, faced the Green Team, the runner-up of the fourth division. Hualian was a veteran team with strength above the Green Team. However, due to incorrect lineup arrangements and bad luck, they were unable to perform as desired. On the other hand, the Green Team, with concerted efforts, became more and more courageous. Especially in the third and fifth groups, the battles were the most thrilling. Green Team's Chen Yinzhou and Qin Duye fought fiercely for five games, each winning 3-2 against Hualian's top players Lu Wenliang and Li Zaichun, thus laying the foundation for victory and creating an upset. When Hualian's main players Li Zhen and chopper Zhong Zhihui displayed their power in the sixth and seventh groups, the overall situation had been decided, and it was of no help. As a result, the Green Team defeated Hualian 4-3. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3>Municipal High School Sports Association Volleyball Finals; Tongji and Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School Win Men's and Women's Championships Respectively</h3>
<p>Huayan Wins Exhibition Match Against Soviet Union</p>
<p>The middle school volleyball league organized by the Municipal Secondary School Sports Association held its finals for both men's and women's groups at the gymnasium of the Municipal Sports Hall starting at 1:30 PM yesterday. Due to the hot weather, the audience was not very crowded. As a result of the final battle, the women's group of Municipal No. 1 defeated Aiguo 2-1 and won the championship. The men's group of Tongji Affiliated Middle School defeated Zhongzhi A in straight sets and won the title. After the competition, an exhibition match was held between Huayan and the Soviet Union A team. The Soviet Union team was late, and Gok Deng only appeared at 4:20 PM. The original plan was to win three out of five games. After three games, it was already 5:00 PM. Because there were four makeup games for the B Group Industrial and Commercial Basketball League, it could not be concluded. The results of the three games were that Huayan led 2-1.</p>
<p>In the women's group final, Municipal No. 1 faced Aiguo. The referee was Hu Xidi. In the first game, Aiguo took the lead and maintained the advantage all the way. After the change of sides, Municipal No. 1 chased hard and unexpectedly caught up later, winning 21-19. In the second game, the competition between the two sides was even more intense. After 16-16, they tied repeatedly. Aiguo relied on their final efforts to tie the score 21-20 with a score of 21-20. In the final game, Municipal No. 1 became more and more courageous. On the other hand, Aiguo's energy gradually declined, and they finally could not hold on. Municipal No. 1 won 21-15 to secure the victory. The overall result was 2-1, and Municipal No. 1 defeated Aiguo to win the championship.</p>
<p>The men's group final followed, with Tongji Affiliated Middle School facing Zhongzhi A. The referee was Wu Zibin. After the start of the game, because of the difference in strength between the two sides, the battle was not as tense as the women's group. Tongji Affiliated Middle School won 21-13 and 21-17 successively. Zhongzhi Tian lost in straight sets, and Tongfu won the men's group championship. In the exhibition match, Huayan performed exceptionally well. They easily took the first game 21-14. In the second game, the Soviet Union strengthened their defense and tried their best to counterattack, and they did manage to win 21-17. In the third game, the Huayan army regained its momentum and broke through again 21-17. It was almost 5:00 PM and could not continue. Huayan led 2-1.

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Bank General Manager Discusses the Current Overseas Remittance Problem and Proposes an Outline for Improving Overseas Remittance Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Liu Zuoren, General Manager of Guangdong Provincial Bank, has been in Suzhou since the beginning of last month, attending the National Provincial Banks Joint Annual Meeting. He is currently passing through Shanghai on his way back to Guangdong. He took time to meet with reporters to discuss the current issues with overseas remittances and gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Overseas remittances are of great importance, and have previously been a significant item in balancing China's international balance of payments. Today, they are the primary source for supplementing China's foreign exchange reserves. They have significant implications for China's finances, fiscal policies, and economy.</p>
<p>Based on statistics that are available from various sources, the historical amounts of overseas remittances are as follows (unit: millions of national currency): Year 21: 323, Year 22: 305, Year 23: 232, Year 24: 316, Year 25: 320, Year 26: 450, Year 27: 600, Year 28: 1200, Year 29: 1800, Year 30: 244, Year 31: 862, Year 32: 2400, Year 33: 1482, Year 34 (January to August): 286.</p>
<p>Since Year 25, overseas remittances have been more than sufficient to offset the amount of excess imports. However, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, annual overseas remittances averaged approximately 1 billion national currency. Although this amount was three times higher than before the war, due to currency depreciation, the actual amount of overseas remittances during the war is estimated to be about one-third less than the pre-war amount.</p>
<p>After the post-war recovery, there was a constant difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate for overseas remittances. Coupled with the daily depreciation of the currency, lengthy remittance times, complicated procedures, and other factors, the general trend of overseas remittances has been decreasing. It is estimated that the total amount of national overseas remittances after the post-war recovery averages approximately 17 billion yuan per month, or approximately 200 billion yuan per year. If calculated based on the rate of currency depreciation, overseas remittances after the post-war recovery are approximately one-seventh of the pre-war annual average of 300 million yuan.</p>
<p>Accepting Institutions</p>
<p>The Bank of China's overseas remittance figures are estimated to account for approximately 50% of the total national overseas remittances during the war. After the post-war recovery, with the re-establishment of silver shops, money houses, and remittance agencies, the Bank of China's share of overseas remittances has decreased to approximately 30%. The remaining 70% is mostly remitted through foreign banks or private domestic silver shops and remittance agencies, indicating that a large portion of overseas remittances has been evaded.</p>
<p>Concentrated in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Currently, overseas remittances from all countries in the Americas or British territories are mostly concentrated in Hong Kong, making Hong Kong the center for overseas remittance evasion. In recent months, as the black market exchange rate has been much higher than the official rate, the evasion of overseas remittances to Hong Kong has been increasing daily. It is estimated that recently, the amount of overseas remittances evading to Hong Kong has reached US$10 million per month. The result of overseas remittance evasion to Hong Kong has a significant impact on China's economy, which can be analyzed in three points: (1) It deprives China of a source of foreign exchange to offset the excess of foreign trade deficits, making the international financial balance more complicated. (2) Overseas remittances flowing into foreign banks become frozen funds, which are not only not invested in domestic production and construction projects, but also deepen the domestic economic crisis if they become floating capital participating in speculative activities. (3) It directly contributes to the prosperity of Hong Kong and indirectly enriches the foreign exchange reserves of the United States, offsetting the excess of the British international balance of payments.</p>
<p>Improvement Strategies</p>
<p>Reviewing past overseas remittance policies, it is believed that the main problems that urgently need improvement in the future are: (1) Strengthening the overseas remittance network, (2) Reducing the difference between the official exchange rate and the market rate for foreign exchange, (3) Improving the remittance and payment methods, and (4) Providing services to overseas compatriots.</p>
<p>How to strengthen the absorption of overseas remittances should start with loosening regulations and expanding the overseas remittance network. Overseas Chinese are located in various places. In addition to the Bank of China setting up branches in major overseas cities, local banks in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, as well as other banks handling overseas remittances, should be allowed to establish branches in areas with a higher concentration of overseas Chinese. Banks should maintain close ties with remittance agencies that specialize in absorbing funds from lower and middle-class overseas Chinese. In addition, banks should continue to seek more agents or correspondent banks, and should also increase the number of overseas remittance payment institutions domestically.</p>
<p>There are three opinions on how to reduce the difference between the official exchange rate and the market rate for foreign exchange. (1) The best approach is to bring the official rate closer to the market rate, adjusting the exchange rate at any time to eliminate the difference between the two. Alternatively, the official rate could be abolished altogether, allowing the exchange rate to stabilize at a natural level. (2) Implement a subsidy policy. The amount of the subsidy must be increased at any time, and it is best for local national banks to consult with local overseas remittance banks to determine a rate that is close to or not lower than the black market exchange rate. (3) Handle foreign currency remittances and deposits, i.e., so-called original currency deposits. When overseas remittances in the original currency are returned to the country, they should be deposited into an account, and payments should be made in national currency based on the exchange rate and subsidy method on the day of payment.</p>
<p>How to improve the remittance and payment methods: the collection and payment should be simple and quick, the procedures should be simplified, and everything should be scientifically managed to achieve speed and efficiency. The attitude of the staff should be gentle and courteous.</p>
<p>There are three opinions on how to serve overseas compatriots:</p>
<p>(1) The government should assist overseas Chinese in their economic recovery. (2) Domestic and foreign overseas remittance banks should establish an overseas Chinese service organization to facilitate communication. (3) In cases where overseas compatriots or their families have financial difficulties or have their remittances cut off, low-interest loans should be provided.</p>
<p>Liu concluded that although the current overseas remittance problem is caused by the significant difference between the official rate and the black market rate, leading to remittance evasion, a satisfactory solution can be achieved if the aforementioned improvement measures are implemented. With the large number of overseas Chinese today, as long as we provide good guidance and actively absorb remittances, the future of overseas remittances remains bright.</p>
<h3>The Reproduction Industry Fights Again for Yarn Allocation; The Production of Yarn, Although Improved Due to Original Cotton, Is Still Insufficient</h3>
<p>The textile industry association's cotton yarn allocation work, involving more than 300 reproduction businesses from both local and out-of-town areas, has been its target, and disputes in this area have been ongoing for years. This time, the joint allocation has expanded from local to outer areas such as Dangxi Wu, etc., and the number of yarn factories subject to requisitions is 67 units. The scale is large, and the strength is thick. According to related sources, the 20,000-piece joint allocation method being tested is only the beginning and is not yet normal. This is because during the re-allocation period in November and December of last year, the requisitioned yarn factories were limited to the city and already reached 24,000 pieces per month. If the supply of raw cotton can be resolved, the allocation of yarn disputes is expected to decrease. It is heard that the cotton importers had long ago paid for the cotton clothing ordered from the United States, but because they did not meet the import quota allocation procedures, a considerable amount of goods arrived but were not allowed to be used. Among them, in terms of those who have arrived in Hong Kong and are urgently awaiting transshipment, there are already 400,000 to 500,000 bales. Relevant parties have formulated a plan to unfreeze them, which will be collected and re-allocated to the various yarn factories by the Central Trust Bureau. In addition, the Head Office is also working hard to import foreign cotton. The raw material problem of yarn factories is not as severe as the outside world has reported. Director Zou of the textile industry association has discussed this with President Zhang of the Central Bank several times. The fact that the yarn factories have been able to obey Zou recently is also one of the important reasons. As for the yarn allocation agencies, they also held a joint allocation in the name of the Cotton Spinning Industry Association in the Sixth District in September and October of last year. However, the outside world's impressions were not good, and the actual allocation was rumored to be inconsistent. This time, the yarn factories reiterated the previous proposal, and the textile industry association is still carefully considering this. Some people advocate flexibility, while others advocate rules. The nine trade associations of the reproduction industry in the city recently held a joint meeting and drafted a summary of opinions on improving yarn allocation on the spot, which was submitted to the textile industry association, advocating for regulated and open sales, so that the yarn factory's business and profits can be maintained at a just level. The reproduction industry's use of yarn is spared from having to seek it in the black market, and it was also stated that regardless of the size, age, or location of the factory, as long as the yarn factory is within the scope of control of the textile industry association, it should be evenly and regularly allocated according to its production equipment and recent activities. The price of yarn should be negotiated at any time to protect the reproduction cost of the yarn factory in principle. The summary is quite critical of the textile industry association's current yarn allocation methods. Mentioning the joint allocation handled by the Sixth District especially shows distrust, which shows the deep attention paid by the reproduction industry to the measures taken by the textile industry association. According to the persons in charge of the reproduction industry, in the most recent two months, the textile industry association allocated very little yarn. The amount obtained by the industries is less than 30% of the amount required. The high price of yarn in the black market is inevitable. Recently, the textile industry association's negotiated price was 8.8 million yuan for 20-count standard, but the actual market price is much higher than this. In the end, it is because the production equipment is limited, and the yarn produced is not enough to meet the demand. The price follows the market, and the upward trend is inevitable.</p>
<h3>National Banks and Others Regularly Meet to Discuss Handling Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding a batch of foreign cotton that had already arrived at the port before the end of April this year, but could not obtain a license within the approved foreign cotton quota, the total amount is estimated to be over US$8 million. The principle is that the government will collect and purchase it, and then hand it over to national and private yarn factories for processing and weaving. To discuss the detailed handling methods of the foreign cotton, the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Audit Department, the China Textile Construction Company, and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association will each send representatives to hold a joint meeting at the Central Trust Bureau this Thursday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Orders Iced Eggs to Be Shipped to the UK in Batches</h3>
<p>Recently, the Central Trust Bureau has been commissioned by the Export Promotion Committee to order four batches of iced eggs, totaling 2,250 tons, from the China Iced Egg Industry Association on behalf of the government for shipment to the United Kingdom. Each ton can be sold for 200 pounds, and the payment for the eggs will be made by the Central Bank. It is heard that iced egg merchants are willing to accept the order. In addition to the 2,000-plus tons of iced eggs, the bureau previously ordered 250 tons of dried egg flakes from the iced egg industry, which are also being shipped to the UK. The first batch of 50 tons has already been shipped to the British Ministry of Food. It is reported that the British Ministry of Food and grain merchants have expressed great appreciation for China's egg products.</p>
<h3>Increased Cigarette Tax Rate to Be Implemented Starting from the 26th of This Month; An Additional One-Third Will Be Levied on Top of 100%</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance previously planned to increase the cigarette tax rate in the city by 200% on the 1st of this month. Subsequently, the Cigarette Factory Industry Association convened a cigarette business research conference, pointing out that cigarettes are currently in the mold season, and sales are sluggish. It sent representatives to visit Director Fang of the Goods Tax Bureau, requesting that the cigarette goods tax be increased by 100% based on the current tax amount and hoping to postpone implementation until August 1.</p>
<p>It is learned that the authorities believe that the reduction in work and slow sales in various factories are indeed true. In order to show consideration for the difficulties of businesses and take into account tax revenue, the new tax rate will be a general increase of 100%, plus one-third of the total amount of the new tax. That is, if the original tax per box was 600,000 yuan, the new tax amount should be 1.6 million yuan, and it will be implemented starting from the 26th of this month. As for various cigarettes that have the same tax rate but different prices, the Cigarette Business Research Conference will propose adjustments in the coming days to show uniformity.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil to Be Rationed Per Household; Expected to Be Implemented Before the 20th</h3>
<p>The matter of rationing edible oil per household has been actively prepared by the relevant authorities and has taken a sudden turn for the better. It is expected to be implemented before the 20th of this month. The method is the same as sugar rationing, printing oil purchase certificates, which are issued by the Civil Affairs Department to each district and then distributed to each household. With a population of 4.17 million in the city, each person will be rationed half a catty of oil, and the selling price will be approximately 5,000 yuan. The final decision will be made at that time. As for the source of edible oil, the Central Trust Bureau will entrust seven major oil factories in the city to extract oil from soybeans, and then the oil will be sold through the member stores of the Oil Merchants Association. The bureau has transported 2,300 tons of soybeans from the Northeast to Shanghai and will allocate them to various factories for extraction within this week. However, according to the Civil Affairs Department's household statistics, the city's population is 4.17 million, and each rationing of oil requires 20,800 dan, and the shortage will be supplemented by Qingdao. The first rationing will be on the 15th of this month and will consist of soybean oil and raw oil. In the future, rapeseed oil will be the main type, but the distribution will be carried out after a considerable amount of soybean oil has been accumulated, sufficient for one rationing.</p>
<p>Qingdao Exports Surplus Soybean Oil</p>
<p>Director Lin of the Qingdao Municipal Social Affairs Bureau returned to Qingdao yesterday after passing through Shanghai from Beijing. It is said that the Ministry of Food has agreed in principle to transport the surplus soybean oil from Qingdao in order to maintain the local production capacity and to regulate the shortage of edible oil in the cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line. The transportation part is primarily carried out by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's North Pacific grain vessels. If the transportation situation is normal, approximately 3,000 tons can be transshipped per month. This city is one of the major consumption areas for edible oil.</p>
<h3>Cork Manufacturers Request a Ban on Imported Finished Products</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, the city's cork industry has been threatened by imported foreign goods and has petitioned the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting the government to ban the import of foreign cork products. The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office convened a meeting of cork manufacturers yesterday to discuss this matter. It is reported that cork comes from Spain, Portugal, and North Africa, with an annual import volume of approximately 800,000 kilograms, equivalent to approximately US$400,000. In the import control measures, cork is listed as a non-quota elective import item, but since November of last year, there has been no import of cork raw materials. Manufacturers hope that the government can understand the difficulties of businesses and allow an import quota of US$400,000 for cork raw materials, but for foreign cork finished products, except for those with special uses, all others should be banned from import.</p>
<h3>Flour Association Applies to Continue Rationing Flour</h3>
<p>The flour needed by the city's pasta food industry was ordered by the Central Trust Bureau to continue rationing last month, and the allocation price was the same as the price agreed upon by the bureau. However, rationing has not yet started in July, and the Flour Bran Association sent members to the Central Trust Bureau yesterday to make contact and apply to continue rationing. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the distribution of flour can be released, and Li Lang flour will still be distributed, but the price and delivery technology still need to be reviewed. The association will continue to send members to the Central Trust Bureau today, and it is hoped that a decision will be made.</p>
<p>In addition, the flour ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from the United States is extremely large in quantity and has been continuously transported. The bureau will sell it in large quantities in the market to suppress the price of flour and prevent unscrupulous merchants from raising prices and hoarding goods.</p>
<h3>The Number of Members in the Economic Survey Mission to Japan Will Not Be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Pan Xulun, the head of the economic survey mission to Japan, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and stated that the various preparations for the mission to Japan are being handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he is not convenient to disclose the details. According to reports from other sources, the MacArthur Headquarters has not yet responded after our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to Tokyo for negotiations. However, rumors that the number of members in our delegation will be reduced are probably untrue. When the number of members in our delegation was initially determined, the past Indian delegation to Japan was used as a reference. Relevant people estimate that the mission can be formed within this month.</p>
<h3>It Is Difficult to Increase the Purchase Price of Pledged Boxed Tea in the 35th Year; Those Unwilling to Sell to the Government Can Dispose of It Freely</h3>
<p>The disposal of pledged boxed tea in the 35th year was approved by the Four Joint General Management Council on the 3rd of this month and will be collected and purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. It is learned that the Central Trust Bureau has not yet formally received a clear order, but has begun preparing for the collection and purchase matters and will begin processing once the notice arrives. According to the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau, the purchase of the boxed tea this time is not a compulsory action. If tea merchants can find a way to export the tea themselves and are unwilling to sell to the government, they can still dispose of it freely. However, those who fail to repay the loan upon expiration should be disposed of in accordance with the treaty. The purchase price was agreed upon by the Central Bank and relevant parties to be 720,000 yuan for Qihong, 600,000 yuan for Tunlv, 550,000 yuan for Minhong, 480,000 yuan for Pinglv, 520,000 yuan for Yulv, and 320,000 yuan for Wenhong and Wenlv. Based on the pledged 80,000 boxes, the purchase funds required are 28 billion yuan. It is heard that tea merchants hope to increase the price appropriately, but it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain government approval. After the purchase, the Central Trust Bureau will be responsible for overseas sales. All grades of quality must be re-inspected, and those that do not meet the standards will not be imported or exported. In addition, the pledged boxed tea will all expire on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shou Jingwei Inspects the Tea Industry in Taiwan and Believes That the Future Is Still Optimistic</h3>
<p>Shou Jingwei, the manager of the China Tea Joint Operating Company, went to Taiwan on the 17th of last month to preside over the opening of the company and inspect the situation of the tea industry in Taiwan Province. He returned to Shanghai the week before. When the reporter visited him, he was informed of the general situation of the tea industry in Taiwan. He said, "Taiwan's tea-producing areas are mainly in Taipei and Hsinchu, and the main products are Oolong tea, Pouchong tea, and black tea, among which Oolong tea is particularly famous in Europe, America, and the Near East.</p>
<p>The development of Taiwanese tea began after the Han people migrated to the area. Initially, it was only for consumption by the Han people in the area. Then, as production increased, it began to be sold to Fujian and Guangdong provinces. In 1869, a British person named [Name] shipped 210,000 catties of Taiwanese tea to New York, which was the beginning of the export of Taiwanese tea to foreign markets.</p>
<p>During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, planting was encouraged. At its peak, the planted area occupied 45,455 chia (each chia is equal to 14.5 mu, accounting for 649,094.5 mu), and production increased sharply, with a maximum annual production of 26 million catties. During World War II, due to food shortages, the Japanese converted tea fields to cultivate food crops and tried to increase food production, resulting in large-scale, fully mechanized manufacturing plants. 49 in Taipei, 5 in Hsinchu, 137 in Taichung, and 12 in Kaohsiung were gradually destroyed, and the Taiwanese tea industry fell sharply.</p>
<p>Before the war, the output of Taiwanese tea in 1936 was 20,721 households producing crude tea, with a production volume of 18,081,426 catties, and 73 households producing refined tea, with a production volume of 17,485,783 catties. After the victory, in 1946, the total output of refined tea (including Oolong tea, Pouchong tea, black tea, and green tea) was only 6 million pounds (4.5 million catties). If it is not affected by prolonged rains this year, it is expected to produce 50,000 dan.</p>
<p>In 1935, the total export volume of Taiwanese tea reached 141,815,616 catties. After the victory, in December 1946, 400,000 pounds were exported to the New York branch of the China Trust Company, and in 1947, another batch of 7,000 boxes was shipped to the American branch of the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Currently, the Bank of Taiwan has undertaken tea factory loans to make their capital flow and production is not stagnant. The provincial tea company has distributed tea loans of 300 million in joint currency, and other tea merchants and cooperatives have distributed tea loans of 490 million yuan. The China Joint Operating Company's Taiwan Bank approved tea loans of 200 million yuan. Tea loans in Taiwan Province totaled 990 million yuan, and if calculated based on the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal currency adjusted on July 3, the 990 million joint currency tea loans are equivalent to 64,350,000,000 legal currency. Taiwan's provincial tea loans have crowned domestic tea loans, and the future of joint tea is optimistic.</p>
<p>However, it is heard that many tea merchants, due to rising prices, cannot replenish raw materials after the finished products are sold, creating a virtual profit and real loss on the books, and deceiving the eyes of the inspectors, replicating old tea, and mixing it into foreign markets, and if they are allowed to do so, the tragic situation of Taiwanese tea exports will be unimaginable. The Taiwan Tea Company has learned from this and is actively seeking solutions to the following difficulties: (1) the restoration of tea gardens, (2) the impact of prices on production costs, (3) the replenishment of materials, (4) the instability of the lives of tea farmers, and (5) the inability of Taiwanese compatriots to understand the government's tea policies.</p>
<h3>Should the Import of Batteries Be Prohibited? The Authorities Are Currently Considering It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office recently received instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating that the Guangzhou Battery Industry Association has stated that the large number of foreign batteries imported for dumping has affected the existence of more than 40 private battery factories in the country. It specifically submitted a document to the municipal government, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, hoping to ban the import of foreign goods to protect the industry. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that batteries are divided into dry and wet types, with different sizes and uses, and it is necessary to consider whether the country can be self-sufficient after foreign imports are prohibited. The municipal Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has been specifically instructed to verify and report the situation.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Textile Industry Sends Trade Delegation to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th] The Hong Kong textile industry is currently planning to send a trade delegation to the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and Siam. The delegation of 25 people is being sent by the Chinese Manufacturers Association and is scheduled to depart at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. According to the chairman of the association, the purpose of the delegation's trip is to regain the pre-war market, expand existing markets, and open up new markets for Hong Kong products. Hong Kong manufacturers are facing strong competition from Japan and other countries. The chairman of the association also said that China's machinery is not as modern as that of other countries, but the main difficulty lies not in this, but in the high cost of living, which increases costs and makes it difficult to sell products.</p>
<p>New Longan Seedlings Damaged</p>
<p>Quanzhou News: This time, the local new longan flower seedlings were severely damaged by wind and rain, resulting in considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Gallnuts Smuggled South</h3>
<p>Sichuan gallnuts are gathered and scattered in Hankou and Shanghai. For the past month, prices in Chongqing and Hankou have consistently exceeded those in Shanghai. Recently, the Shanghai market price has been slightly firm due to the scarcity of incoming goods. However, the Chongqing price has risen to 800,000 yuan, which is still 50,000 yuan higher than the Shanghai price. According to sources in the industry, there are rumors that these gallnuts are being trafficked to Guangzhou and smuggled to Hong Kong. However, transactions in gallnuts here are extremely low, and Hong Kong prices have not risen sharply. The reason for the smuggling is likely due to the differences in exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Output of Pork Bristles</h3>
<p>[Central Sky Agency, Lanzhou, 5th] 170,000 tons of Gansu province pork bristles have been transported out, managed by the Lanzhou branch of the China Trust Bureau under commission from an American merchant. Previously, camel wool, a trade item from Gansu, had no export route due to high costs and poor quality.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth Firm</p>
<p>The woolen market on Qipan Street and Chang Le Tea House is still very tight. Except for the usual summer items of "Power Lease," "Fan Li Ding," and other brands, all other woolen fabrics, whether shiny, for men or women, colored, or rough, are trending strongly, especially thick overcoating woolens. Merchants from Taiyuan Province and kebang (visiting merchants) are actively selecting and searching for goods. This is because new shipments are not arriving, transshipment through Hong Kong is difficult, and the local factory production, except for that of China Textile Corporation, is limited. Those in the industry have a positive outlook.</p>
<p>Ya'an and Other Counties Promote Tea Planting</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Ya'an, 30th] (Delayed) The border tea transported from Xikang to Tibet amounts to 30,000 loads per year, which holds considerable economic and political value. To increase tea-producing areas and improve tea quality, the provincial government has established large seedling nurseries in Ya'an, Tianquan, and other counties to cultivate tea trees, distributing them widely to the people for large-scale promotion.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Philippine Pesos to Be Handled in Four Locations</h3>
<p>According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, regarding the Philippine government's previous decision to limit the period for exchanging Philippine pesos, our ambassador to the Philippines, to facilitate the exchange for overseas Chinese in the country, negotiated with the Philippine government. As a result, the Philippine government has agreed to entrust Citibank or Bank of China in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Xiamen to collect Philippine pesos and remit them to the Philippine government for exchange. The exchange period has been extended to August 21st of this year. Overseas Filipino Chinese in the country holding Philippine pesos are advised to take note.</p>
<p>Longkou Vermicelli Prices Rise</p>
<p>According to Tianjin telecommunications, Longkou vermicelli prices have risen to 1.45 million yuan, an increase of about 20%. Prices here are also following closely, selling for 1.92 million yuan.</p>

<h3>The Tenth Anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident—Looking Back, Looking Forward</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Archives</p>
<p>It has been a full ten years since the "July 7th" Lugou Bridge Incident occurred.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, soldiers on the front lines have fought valiantly, and people across the country have contributed labor and donations. We finally won the final victory, but the flower of victory has borne bitter fruit. Some may ask: Will the tragedy of July 7th be repeated? This is not alarmist talk. Recalling the domestic and international situation before July 7th and looking at the current situation, one cannot help but be concerned. Although July 7th was the prelude to the War of Resistance, the ambition and conspiracy of Japanese aggression had already been conceived and grown long before July 7th. The September 18th Incident was the initial step in invading China, and the Lugou Bridge Incident was the realization of seizing North China. Japan had the intention of invading China even before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, annexing the Ryukyu Islands and seizing Taiwan. Subsequently, the Korean issue led to the Sino-Japanese War. After the war, Japan had already established a foothold in Northeast China. World War I further propelled it into a major power. From then on, Japan's gradual and rapacious encroachment on China became even more aggressive.</p>
<p>Although Japan had long harbored the intention to annex China, it did not dare to openly launch a war. At that time, China was divided by warlords, with constant internal strife. Therefore, Japan exploited the contradictions and suspicions between warlords, doing its utmost to sow discord. Furthermore, it seized opportunities to engage in economic operations and obtain various privileges, using them as capital for future aggression. What it desired was unending internal chaos in China; what it feared was unification. It attempted to obstruct the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution, and the May 3rd Jinan Incident was a manifestation of its obstruction. By the time the Northeast changed flags, the Northern Expedition was completed, the country was unified, and construction began, Japan could no longer fulfill its ambitions. It was then that it revealed its hideous face and the evil consequences.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, our country had already achieved unification. Although construction had just begun, industry and commerce had taken initial shape. Although finances were not abundant, they were not as depleted as they are today. However, we were still taken advantage of by those with ulterior motives. After eight years of war, all construction has been destroyed by artillery fire and is now incomplete. The people's livelihood is increasingly difficult, and finances are increasingly strained. If the Communist Party does not wake up and continues to engage in territorial division and military expansion, the lessons of the past are a cause for grave concern.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when Japan began launching its war of aggression, everyone believed that it was a desperate gamble. If Japan were defeated, it would be irrecoverable. As it turned out, Japan was defeated and surrendered, but on the eve of defeat, there were still 17 divisions of elite troops from Tokyo to Kanagawa, and large amounts of gold were found on the seabed of Tokyo Bay. These signs indicated that Japan was defeated but not crushed, like a robber on the eve of execution shouting, "I'll be a good man again in twenty years." After the Allied forces landed and took control, Japan again used international contradictions to seek opportunities for its revival. In the economic sphere, some monopolistic large enterprises, such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, were nominally dissolved, but in reality, they were fragmented into smaller units. Industry still maintained the levels of 1930 to 1934, and the steel production quota was not small. The major light industries, such as the textile industry, had 6 million spindles and 200,000 looms, unmatched by other countries in the Far East. The recent declaration of opening up to foreign trade is nothing less than opening a path to revival for Japanese industry. Its demands for fishing rights in the Kuril Islands, special rights for Taiwanese immigrants, and joint administration of the Ryukyu Islands further demonstrate its surging ambition, with great intent to "make a comeback." Although Japan is the defeated party, the militaristic ideology of the past has not been eradicated. Now that the peace treaty has not yet been concluded, it has already begun to relive the old dream of aggression and encroachment, causing victorious China to recall the situation of ten years ago, inevitably leading to the re-enactment of the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>The loss of the Northeast and the failure of the League of Nations to impose sanctions allowed Japan's ambition for aggression to grow, inch by inch. On one hand, it established the puppet state of Manchukuo; on the other hand, it continued to advance into the interior, attacking Yuguan and conquering Rehe, all of which were preludes to the Lugou Bridge Incident. The reason why the Japanese bandits were so rampant at that time was that they recognized the invasion of China as a golden opportunity not to be missed. This was because it was the most severe period of the world economic panic. After President Roosevelt took office in the United States, he was busy with domestic policies, hoping to overcome the domestic economic crisis. In Europe, after Hitler came to power, he actively sought to break free from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles, leaving Britain with no time to look eastward. The Soviet Union was also focused on the implementation of its Five-Year Plan. At the same time, after the failure of the disarmament conference, the United States began allocating funds to build its navy in 1932, but Roosevelt expressed his willingness to continue disarmament. Britain also maintained the provisions of the London Naval Treaty and the Washington Naval Treaty, but Japan secretly expanded its navy. After the failure of the London Naval Conference in 1935, Japan withdrew from the conference and openly built ships on a large scale, so that the Japanese navy had the potential to surpass the British and American navies. All these circumstances created an opportunity for Japan to invade China.</p>
<p>Japan's ambition to invade China was not something that arose in a day. Its preparations were abundant, and its operations had been going on for decades. Weak China was not enough to resist it. However, China was able to engage with the Japanese bandits for eight years and win the final victory because of its spiritual strength and the unity of the whole country. After the victory, we should have engaged in construction, restored the vitality lost during the war, and embarked on the road to national revival. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party engaged in military expansion, destroying unity, causing the flames of war to reignite and the people to suffer the disaster of war again. Broken industries cannot be rebuilt, disrupted transportation cannot be restored, the economy is even more depleted, and the people's livelihood is even more declining. These are all caused by the Communist Party. One may ask: "Will July 7th come again?"</p>
<p>The root of the eight-year War of Resistance was the Northeast. After the victory, the Northeast has not yet been fully recovered, and alarm bells are ringing on the northwest border. An Outer Mongolia that has been separated from China and independent for two years is actually leading troops to assert its dominance, invading its former suzerain state, which has to be alarming. Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang are intertwined, serving as a barrier to our northwest. They have long been coveted by others. Due to the brewing of independence in Outer Mongolia, many incidents have occurred. Xinjiang is located on the border, with a complex ethnic makeup. The government is unable to attend to it due to many troubles in the country. The previous Yining Incident was carefully handled by the central government, which re-established ties with Xinjiang, which had been isolated for a long time. Xinjiang after the Yining Incident is like the Northeast changing flags in the past, and the invasion of the Outer Mongolian army is another scene of the "September 18th" Incident!</p>
<p>Xinjiang leans against the Pamir Mountains in the west, surrounded by high mountains, with only the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains bordering Outer Mongolia, a flat sandy area with no defenses. Nomadic people live there, galloping for hundreds of miles, considering it normal. Since the loss of Kulun in 1921, the Outer Mongolian government and Tannu Uriankhai have become independent, separating from the north. Now, the alarming situation in Xinjiang cannot help but remind people of the past in Outer Mongolia. Moreover, Xinjiang's land is twice as large as the Northeast, and Xinjiang's treasures include gold, coal, iron, oil, primitive forests, and vast pastures. Recently, uranium mines have also been discovered. The desire to arouse foreigners' greed for its reserves is no less than that for the Northeast, and its importance is greater than that of the Northeast. Will the scene that was staged in the Northeast in the past be repeated in the Northwest?</p>
<p>Looking at past history, after each war, there must be a peace movement, but after this great war, there seem to be some exceptions. Although the United Nations organization has been established, it cannot eliminate the world's crises. Originally, after China's eight-year War of Resistance, various countries have recognized the spirit of the Chinese nation and can overcome material poverty. If after victory, we engage in construction and reach a certain level, it would not be difficult to stabilize the Far East and lay the foundation for world peace. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party engaged in military expansion, destroying unity, turning a beautiful flower of victory into a withered and broken one. Seeing Japan growing stronger and hearing alarms from the Northwest, how can the various situations before "July 7th" not reappear before our eyes? At this moment, the Communist Party should pull back from the brink, thoroughly reflect, and not become a sinner of the nation!</p>
<h3>The Power of Our New Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhou Songxi</p>
<p>The original article was published in the June issue of "Reader's Digest" in the United States, written by former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William C. Bullitt, detailing the Soviet Union's ambitions for the world and its use of communist parties in various countries as tools. Pronouns such as "we" and "our" refer to the United States. This article has not been changed, in order to preserve its authenticity. —Translator's Note</p>
<p>All democratic countries find it difficult to face unpleasant facts and prefer to linger in blissful illusions, until disaster strikes, as we experienced at Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>We know that in World War II, if Hitler had been able to organize the countries of Europe and Africa to attack the Western Hemisphere, and if the Japanese warlords had been able to organize the countries of Asia to launch a similar attack, we would have faced fatal danger. Today, Stalin's goal is to do both (i.e., Hitler's goal and the Japanese warlords' goal). The sacrifices we made in World War II and the results we gained from victory are about to make Europe, the Near East, the Far East, and Africa all be ruled by the Soviet Union. We are now facing this painful possibility, whether we like it or not, this is a very important fact today. If asked, "What error in judgment caused this poisonous fruit of victory?" The answer is very clear: Our government mistakenly believed that the Soviet Union was a peace-loving democratic country, and not a despotic country that was all about plundering and determined to conquer the world, starting in 1941. Therefore, a very unfortunate mistake was made in history. When our troops engaged in war with superb skill and courage and executed our foreign policy, they did not pay attention to the interests of the American people that were related to life and death. Stalin has the ambition to conquer the world, just like Hitler, and we did not do anything to stop him and defend ourselves.</p>
<p>We hoped that he could turn into a gentle and peace-loving person, so at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences, we continuously gave him the rights he wanted. Even former Secretary of State Byrnes believed that he could get along well with Stalin when he sacrificed in 1945. It took several months to realize that Stalin's ambition was endless, and could only be stopped with resolute opposition.</p>
<p>When Byrnes gained this painful lesson (which all Americans will sooner or later receive), he bravely rejected Soviet imperialism. When the Soviet Union was about to invade Turkey, he managed to stop it, and saved the eastern Mediterranean from this fear of invasion. By supporting the Iranian government, he enabled it to drive out the Soviet agents who occupied northern Iran. These two things are enough to prove that Stalin has not dared to risk using force to deal with the United States. We are much stronger than the Soviet Union today, and Stalin knows it.</p>
<p>Our country's position today is very similar to that of France in March 1936. At that time, France's air force and army were the strongest in the world. But Hitler still dared to send troops deep into the Rhineland, and began his life of conquest. We have already obtained evidence that Hitler knew very well that if France could mobilize, it could overwhelm Germany. If France mobilized, it would have to order the troops to turn back. But French mobilization was very expensive. At that time, the French government wanted to balance the budget, and mobilization would separate people from their families and careers. In political terms, it was also not suitable for public opinion, and there were many honest French people who were influenced by distorted reports and mistakenly believed that Hitler would never harm France, just like some people today strongly argue that Stalin will not harm the United States. Therefore, France did nothing at that time.</p>
<p>When Hitler was ready, he immediately overwhelmed France. France did not dare to face the facts in 1936, which led to its own destruction.</p>
<p>When Hitler occupied a strategic area as a base for launching an offensive against a country, he would first comfort the future victims, and lull them into a false sense of security. This is the principle of Hitler's strategy of conquest, and also the principle of Stalin's tactics. His tactics are completely the same as Hitler's: fifth column, propaganda, making treaties, breaking treaties, intimidation, and military force. But Hitler never cultivated such an insidious and powerful tool in the countries he wanted to conquer as Stalin's Communist Party and comrades traveling everywhere. Time is now working against us, just like it was working against France after March 1936. Day by day, we are approaching the development of the Russian atomic bomb. The Soviet Union's large-scale productive forces are still producing for war. Stalin's rule over Eastern and Central Europe is becoming increasingly successful. He can use the resources of a vast area with more than 100 million people to confront us. Stalin has already merged Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Finland, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, Romania, and has placed the entire Poland, the entire Romania, the entire Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania, and the Red Army zone of Germany and Austria under his rule. He is increasingly tightening his grip on Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Finland, which are already in his iron fist. He is also exerting great pressure on Greece and Turkey, and without external assistance, Greece and Turkey cannot resist the Soviet Union. His fifth column is working hard to communize the entire territory of Germany. His agents in France and Italy are very powerful, and have already forced the governments of the two major countries to accept their leaders as state officials. Stalin's power is on the offensive around the world, while the democratic countries are in retreat. To prevent him from uniting the forces of Europe, Asia, and Africa to launch a decisive attack on the Western Hemisphere is the most important thing for the United States today. We cannot simultaneously provide sufficient assistance to all nations threatened by Soviet imperialism. We must carefully select several key points to apply all our strength.</p>
<p>President Truman has given first priority to Greece and Turkey. These two countries are obviously facing the disaster of being invaded, and the urgency is second only to Greece and Turkey for France, because France's position is also a matter of life and death. This is one of the problems we face in the world, and it should be studied in detail.</p>
<p>If Stalin succeeds in controlling France by relying on his fifth column, then the French government will become our enemy. The people of France will obey his orders under the pressure of Communist Party agents and artillery. We will face the threat of Stalin's air force.</p>
<p>If France is controlled by Stalin, then Europe will become a communist world. The Communist Party of Italy is particularly strong, and will definitely fall into Stalin's control. Europe and Asia will become a vast communist continent between the two oceans, and the British and American zones in western Germany will become a small enclave on that continent, until the British and American troops withdraw. Britain will be vulnerable to Russian rockets, which will be more intense than those launched by Germany in France before, and will suffer large bombs like Malta. The smaller countries of Europe will fall one by one. If Europe is governed by the Communist Party and directly listens to Moscow, then the United States will feel as endangered as if Europe were ruled by the Nazis and directly obeyed Berlin.</p>
<p>Today, the Communist Party is the largest party in France, but there are many small parties, so that 72% of the members of parliament are non-communists. In a democratic country with normal mental, material, and moral values, the Communist Party should not be involved in the government. However, France has suffered heavy material losses, and non-communist leaders have to do everything they can to recover. Therefore, the Communist Party has used the threat of general strikes to force other parties to give it high positions in the government. Today, its famous leader Thorez, who was a deserter from the French army in World War II, serves as Deputy Premier, and Communist Party members have become ministers of defense, labor, health, and reconstruction.</p>
<p>The ground staff of the French Air Force are now almost entirely controlled by the Communist Party, and many officials are Communist Party members. As for the army itself, there are many party members. In addition, the Communist Party has its own well-equipped underground forces, which outnumber the regular French army. People in Paris freely say: "If Stalin wants to take over France, he can do it anytime with a phone call."</p>
<p>If the non-communist leaders who make up the majority of the French parliament decide to organize a national coalition government to oppose the minority Communist Party, then we should provide the necessary assistance to enable it to maintain a democratic government. Furthermore, we should also help them establish France's economic institutions. France's basic economic position is sound. If the Communist Party can be controlled, then all the needs to become a stronger democratic country again should be helped to compensate for the devastation suffered during the war and the German occupation.</p>
<p>If France can become a democratic country, then it can unite the democratic countries of Europe to defend themselves. This is a foolproof method, and it is also a method for us to defend ourselves. If most of Europe cannot become a democratic entity, then all of Europe will unite under Soviet tyranny.</p>
<p>Greece, Turkey, France, China—how many more countries need our help? Perhaps there are many more countries. We must help them as much as we can. Today, our national strength is far greater than that of the Soviet Union. This is also the only opportunity for us to avoid an open war with the Soviet Union. We should have the foresight, ability, and courage to prevent Stalin from controlling new strategic areas, and should organize the free nations of the world to resist Soviet imperialism, so that the Soviet dictator always encounters superior forces. That force must be not only military and economic, but also ideal.</p>
<p>If we want to use ideals to defeat the lies and distorted truths of the Communist Party, we have the Bible, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's speech at Independence Hall, and there is no need to look far. In Lincoln's speech, he asked himself "What great principle has maintained the union of these states so long?". His answer was "It is that ideal in the Declaration of Independence, that not only aims at giving liberty to all the people of this country, but hopes that the world in all future time, shall have it." This ideal is what we want to defend, and it is also what we want to contribute to the world. In the field of ideals, freedom is our atomic bomb.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that ambitious people can be driven by communism to attack the democratic countries that we cherish, but it is true. If we do not now face the enemy squarely, and do not realize that the enemy is strong, fierce, cunning, cruel, and does not know what truth, benevolence, and goodwill are, then we will not be able to save ourselves!</p>
<h3>Jinan Vientiane</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Tian's Airmail from Jinan, June 29th</p>
<p>Anyone who has read The Travels of Lao Ts'an cannot help but be captivated and yearn for Jinan, which has been beautified and rendered as enchanting as Jiangnan. Although, today, only the northern part of Jinan can still barely be described as "every house has flowing water, every household has hanging willows"; the saying "peach blossoms on four sides, willows on three, a city of mountains, half a city of lakes" (the Daming Lake couplet), is not as true or realistic as "roads on four sides, bandits on three, a city of refugees, half a city of soldiers."</p>
<p>Jinan, after eight years of the War of Resistance and two years of internal turmoil, may have been thought by those who have never been there to have been destroyed beyond recognition, like other cities in the country. However, on the contrary, except for the former site of the court outside Pulimen, which was once destroyed and has now been rebuilt, walking through the entire city, one can hardly find any traces of destruction. According to people familiar with Jinan, due to Han Fuqu's major retreat, the enemy dropped only two small bombs weighing less than 20 pounds in total on Jinan. After the enemy occupied Jinan, they used it as the largest supply base for North China and spared no effort in construction and expansion. In addition to expanding the northern part of the commercial area opened by the Germans in the west of the city by two or three li as an industrial area, they also developed the area south of the commercial area all the way to the foothills of Sili Mountain and Ma'anshan, building many brand-new Western-style houses, making it a fairly ideal residential area. This newly expanded construction, in terms of area, almost exceeds the old Jinan before the War of Resistance by a factor of one. The more than ten wide asphalt roads crisscrossing the city also embellish Jinan, making it look "like something important," with the initial scale of a modern city. In the early days of the victory of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In the same Jinan City</p>
<p>Three Shandong provincial government chairmen once lived there: He Siyuan from the central government, Li Yu from the CCP, and Yang Yuxun from the puppet organization. Yang was the son-in-law of "Hongxian Emperor" Yuan Shikai. At that time, because Chairman He entered Shandong alone with limited forces, the remnants of Chairman Yang's puppet organization still existed with the support of the enemy puppet army. Li Yu, since the "Qilaishan Seven-Person Uprising," had expanded his troops to more than 200,000. At this time, his troops were all over the outskirts of Jinan. He was also clamoring to compete with Lieutenant General Hosokawa Tadayasu, commander of the 43rd Army of the Japanese army, for the surrender, with the posture of troops approaching the city. In addition, local armed groups from various counties, where soldiers and bandits were difficult to distinguish, were mixed among them. Commanders filled the streets, and refugees were everywhere. Therefore, those who were joking and mocking changed a few numbers in the Daming Lake couplet to become "roads on four sides, bandits on three, a city of refugees, half a city of soldiers."</p>
<p>It was not until the Double Tenth Festival in the 34th year of the Republic, after Li Yannian was ordered to come to Jinan to handle the surrender and the traitors such as Chairman Yang were ordered to be arrested, that the situation in Jinan became slightly more stable than before. But continuing down, Li Yu, because he failed to compete for the surrender, had been fighting and besieging Jinan by force and soft tactics. The "seizure" phenomenon in the early days of victory also frequently increased the infinite hidden pain for the people who had been in enemy territory for many years. It was not until the spring of the 35th year of the Republic, when Wang Yaowu was ordered to come to Jinan to direct military affairs and win back the hearts of the people, that the situation began to stabilize. Otherwise, according to the observation of some qualified people, it is really unimaginable what the situation in Jinan would have evolved into today.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the population of Jinan was less than 400,000. Since the victory, due to the difficulties in all directions, refugees from various counties gathered, and the population once increased to nearly 800,000. Since last month, with the reopening of the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway, some refugees have returned to their hometowns, and the population has decreased to slightly less than 700,000 (excluding the military). After the population increased, housing became the first serious problem. Although there were many buildings left by the enemy in Jinan, and because Shandong people have always been heroic and righteous, almost every family in Jinan has become a refugee shelter, taking in more or less of their relatives and friends who fled from various counties. However, due to the sudden increase in population and the large number of troops, the housing shortage has become increasingly serious. Especially in the commercial area, although there is no need to quote prices in gold bars, asking for rent based on flour is enough to make those living in other places anxious.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wang Chongwu, at least half of the 700,000 people in Jinan are refugees, and at least 200,000 of these 350,000 refugees rely on relief to maintain their lives. In the past, they mainly relied on the UNRRA's flour to build roads and repair the Yellow River堤堤 in a work-for-relief method. However, the UNRRA Shandong-Qingdao branch will end in August. At that time, unless the external situation greatly improves and the refugees can return to their homes and live in peace, their lives will also become the most serious problem.</p>
<p>Due to the surplus of labor, although there is no exact number of unemployed people to investigate, it is not difficult to imagine that the number is alarming. Beggars fill the streets, calling people "sir" and "madam," kowtowing like pounding garlic, especially among school-age children around the age of ten. Labor is generally so cheap that only food is provided, because according to the current prices in Jinan, eating cornbread costs at least more than 200,000 yuan per person per month. When you go out and walk, as long as you are dressed relatively neatly, you may often encounter seven or eight rickshaw pullers asking you "want a ride?" within 500 steps, making you feel that dealing with them is simply an extra hardship. How do they know that these people are also being forced to "walk" due to the high pressure of prices?</p>
<p>There are 100,000 stores of all sizes in Jinan, and almost 70-80% of them rely on selling inventory to make a living. Due to sluggish business and the repeated decline in people's purchasing power, daily business income often does not cover daily expenses. Naturally, there is no remaining power to purchase new goods. When you walk to the front of each store, looking through the glass window, although it still looks like the counters and windows are full, showing a "sufficient inventory" appearance, according to the honest words of some business friends: the bolts of cloth in the window are actually just wrapped with a few circles on the outside to fill the facade, and the "cores" inside are mostly so large that they would scare you when you see them. At the end of last year, according to a survey, 572 businesses were forced to liquidate, and more than 3,000 businesses requested the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau to suspend operations but were not approved. Recently, a friend came from Hong Kong and Shanghai, and I accompanied him to Qingliange, the most famous place for Qingchang and Dagushu here. Although the tea fee is only 2,000 yuan per person, unexpectedly there are at least twenty-five or six beautifully dressed singers sitting in the side boxes, while there are only ten or so listeners sitting in the main hall, forming the greatest irony. More than half of the audience in the city's six movie theaters and two Peking opera theaters are soldiers. To show preferential treatment, the theaters sell half-price tickets to soldiers, which naturally affects the theaters' income. However, according to the person in charge of this newspaper's Jinan distribution office, who also manages a movie theater, the main thing that can barely maintain business is still relying on these military audiences. Ordinary people cannot afford to enjoy a movie that costs 2,000 yuan a ticket, and they are really poor to the bone.</p>
<p>Jinan's scenic spots</p>
<p>Thousand Buddha Mountain and Sili Mountain have long been stationed with troops, and ordinary people are not easily allowed to enter. Although Zhongshan Park in the commercial area can be freely accessed, the park's area is so small that it is not even half the size of the Bund Park. In this hot summer, the park is crowded with tourists, and being among them is like being packed into a jar of sardines. As for the old city of Jinan, which is known as the city of water and has seventy-two famous springs, many famous springs today have long existed only in name. The most famous Baotu Spring has now been used as a reservoir for the waterworks, and Pearl Spring is located in the police station, so ordinary people cannot easily enter. Other places, such as Daming Lake, which has eight scenic spots of Lixia and occupies one-third of the city, have tourist value, but the price of a single boat to cruise around the lake is 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, which is also beyond the reach of ordinary people. Therefore, many people say that Jinan is like a well, and the only greatest enjoyment left for the general middle class is to spend 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to take a bath. However, according to the old manager of Mingxinchi, the largest bathhouse in Jinan on Sanma Road, their business averaged 3,000 people per day before the war and even during the enemy occupation, but now it averages only more than 100 people per day. Indeed, rising prices have made people see bathing not only as removing dirt but also as a high-level enjoyment.</p>
<p>The poor condition of public education personnel in Jinan in the past was the worst in various provinces, with high prices and low salaries. Moreover, even this treatment could not be paid on a monthly basis, and even if it was paid, it would be discounted by 20% or 30%. Since this year, thanks to Chairman Wang's efforts to raise funds from various sources, the central government has also included Jinan in the first tier, along with Beijing and Shanghai, when adjusting the treatment of public education personnel. In addition, with the allocation or purchase of uniforms, cloth, flour, etc., everyone felt that they could barely breathe. As for students, more than 8,000 of the more than 10,000 middle school students were forced to flee from the "liberated areas." Their families suffered miserably from "struggle," and there was no financial support. In the past, they mostly relied on the monthly stipend of 48,000 yuan per month, which could only last for a week in reality. Therefore, the yellow cloth distributed by the relief agency had to be sold and turned into Zhongshan formal attire for middle and lower-level civil servants. After the students exhausted all their possessions, they were forced to do part-time jobs. Those who could not find work were forced to eat noodles made of three flours, bran, and even wild grass roots and elm bark. Their lives are hard enough, but they know very well who caused them to suffer. They only make reasonable appeals, and they have never gone on strike. Therefore, on the one hand, the government increased the amount of the public stipend, and on the other hand, after Wang Yaowu and Shandong Xinbao advocated donating one day's income, the total amount donated and pledged in the past three weeks has reached more than 200 million yuan. In Jinan, which is poor to the bone, this has to be considered the highest and most concrete expression of great sympathy.</p>
<p>If you come to Jinan for the first time, people will definitely tell you the "three nots" of Jinan: "the roads are uneven, the telephone is unclear, and the electric lights are dim." In fact, except for some roads in the suburbs that are like honeycombs, the smooth asphalt roads in the urban area, especially the commercial area, are still rare among the major provincial capitals in the country. The telephone calls are worse than long distance calls in Beijing and Shanghai because the machines are too old. As for the electric lights, the company's coal reserves have been exhausted, and the losses are too great. Except for military and government agencies, even these dim electric lights had already stopped supplying a month ago. In order to save fuel due to sluggish business, (kerosene cost 2 million yuan per large barrel, and once rose to 2.3 million yuan,) even in the summer night, the lights were turned off and the shops closed as early as 10 o'clock, and the whole city was plunged into darkness. After the curfew began at 11:30, iron wire fences were closed one after another at the street corners, and soldiers with live ammunition stood guard at the large and small fortresses, and the whole city seemed to enter another realm. The sound of gunfire and artillery is more familiar to the residents of Jinan than firecrackers. Whether it is day or night, whether it is a military exercise by the National Army or an attack by the Communist Army, they have absolute confidence in Wang Yaowu, and they can still sleep soundly.</p>
<p>Jinan's current situation is due to</p>
<p>Not much coal and high prices</p>
<p>Except for a few yarn factories or flour mills that are uniquely blessed, such as Renfeng, Chengda, Chengtong Dongya, etc., the rest have been shut down by 70-80%. At present, the price of coal in Jinan has risen to 2.5 million yuan per ton, and the retail price is 1,500 yuan per jin. Poor families can only buy two or three jin at a time wrapped in a cloth handkerchief to take home in order to cook. They regard these meager coal fines as precious as "black gold and ink jade." How can they cope with this in the hot summer, or in the bitterly cold northern country when winter comes?</p>
<p>According to past experience, more than 30,000 tons of coal are needed per month in winter. At present, the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway is open, and it is estimated that the six coal mines in Taian, Xintai, Ningyang, and Qufu in southwestern Shandong, which are mined by local methods, produce more than 10,000 tons per month. If they are engaged in transportation and storage at this time, they may be able to avoid freezing and starvation this winter. However, the current difficulty is the lack of transportation tools. The Provincial Highway Bureau has fewer than ten standby trucks, and although the business army has seventy or eighty vehicles, they are also busy grabbing grain, which is more important than coal. As for the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway, it will take until the end of this year at the earliest to be opened to traffic. Even if the Jiaoji Railway is opened immediately, it is even more distant and indefinite due to the lack of materials. Under such difficult traffic conditions, on the contrary, cotton flowing into Jinan from the Communist area, as well as cattle hides collected in Jinan after farmers slaughtered their cattle due to the inability to cultivate land due to the war, have become a flying class and are continuously transported abroad due to the prospect of profit. At the same time, the remaining automobile and bicycle parts and hardware materials, and even gold cloth, etc. in Jinan are flowing to the Communist area one after another. This extremely abnormal exchange of materials can be regarded as more or less embellishing the prosperous and active side of Jinan. The difficulties currently encountered in Jinan are exactly the same as those encountered in major cities in northern China. People are looking forward to a stable tomorrow.</p>
<p>Weekend Forum</p>
<h3>On Reforming Education After the Great University Unrest</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jixi</p>
<p>Following this unprecedented nationwide university upheaval, the current semester has ended hastily, and the next semester is coming in a flash. If the education authorities and educators do not proceed with caution, plan for the future, and boldly reform education, not only will the future of education be unimaginable, but the great task of nation-building will also suffer immeasurably. Now, I respectfully present several methods for reforming education, based on my limited understanding, for correction by the people of the country, and I hope that the education authorities and colleagues in the education field will adopt and implement them.</p>
<p>First, democratize education. The first resolution passed by the Joint Annual Meeting of Educational Organizations in the 34th year of the Republic of China was to establish educational policies. The principles are: (1) In academic matters, there should be freedom to conduct academic research; (2) In thought, there should be freedom of belief and expression; (3) Academic and cultural organizations should have freedom to establish themselves. In administration, a proactive approach should be adopted. The original proposal pointed out: (1) Clearly demarcate the scope of educational undertakings between the central and local governments, and assign responsibilities at different levels; (2) Replace interference with supervision, laissez-faire with assistance, passivity with initiative, prevention with trust, delay with speed, and subjective praise and criticism with objective standards in administrative methods; (3) Encourage private individuals to run educational undertakings and engage in research and experimental work. The above points can be said to be the principles and methods of democratizing education. Because with the freedom to conduct academic research, express thoughts, and establish academic and cultural organizations, education can be democratized, academic thought can flourish, and education and culture can progress. However, the current educational administration, school administration, and all educational facilities often lack freedom and cannot be democratic; they are either overly interfered with or completely laissez-faire; they are either passive everywhere or constantly vigilant. As for the delay and ineffectiveness of educational measures, and the subjective nature of educational rewards and punishments, these are even more common phenomena. These are all the internal reasons for the failure of education and the repeated outbreaks of student unrest. Therefore, if we want to reform education and cultivate a good academic atmosphere, we must respect freedom and implement democracy: patiently guide and supervise young people; sincerely love and assist students; inspire young people to be proactive and self-reliant, and to govern themselves and their studies; implement moral education to make students sincerely convinced, respect teachers, and value the Way; all educational facilities must be swift and reliable, and unexpected events must be dealt with immediately and decisively, and resolved legally and rationally; the evaluation of educational achievements must be based on objective standards, and especially on impartiality and selflessness, and on strict and fair evaluation of merits and demerits, and rewards and punishments in accordance with the law. If we can do this, education can be democratized, student unrest can be eliminated in its infancy, a good academic atmosphere can be created, and satisfactory educational results can be obtained. Therefore, democratizing education is the top priority for reforming education after this unprecedented university unrest.</p>
<p>Second, rationalize allocation. There is a very irrational distribution in education in our country. Taking university education as an example, according to a recent survey, there are 53 public and private universities in the country, 11 of which are located in Shanghai, 5 in Beiping, 4 in Guangzhou, and 3 each in Nanjing, Wuchang, and Chengdu. The above six major cities have a total of 29 universities, accounting for more than half of the total number of universities in the country. The universities in Shanghai alone account for more than one-fifth of the total number of universities in the country. However, there is not a single university in provinces such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang. Other independent colleges and schools above the junior college level are also concentrated in several major cities. Secondary schools are also concentrated in the provincial capitals and cities of various provinces. Some people say that education above the secondary level, especially university education, does not need to and cannot seek balanced development, because the development of education requires the progress of social civilization, especially a university, which must be run in the most culturally advanced metropolis in order to absorb modern civilization, conduct in-depth academic research, and have new creations, inventions, and discoveries, and promote the continuous advancement of society and human culture. Yes, education needs society, and society also needs education; culturally backward societies need to develop education to promote the progress of civilization, just as culturally backward China needs to develop education to promote the modernization of the country. Therefore, we can say that society progresses because of the development of education, and education develops because of the progress of society. Therefore, within the scope permitted by the environment, both higher education and secondary education should seek rational distribution and balanced development. Recently, the student unrest in the Jiangzhe area and the Yingda relocation movement occurred earliest. Regarding the issue of the Yingda campus, the Ministry of Education located it in Jinhua in order to rationalize the distribution. The students of Yingda University argued that Jinhua did not have the conditions to establish a university and advocated relocating the campus. In all fairness, Jinhua is located in the middle of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, bordering the Dongyang River to the south, with the benefit of boats and rafts, and facing Jinhua Mountain to the north, with the beauty of forests. There are four or five middle schools in the city, and many middle schools in the nearby counties. Although its cultural level is not very high, and there are inconveniences in teaching, its quiet environment is quite suitable for cultivating the minds of students and nurturing the noble character of young people. If the Ministry of Education can seek rationality in terms of library equipment and teacher treatment, and if a virtuous and capable president leads from above, for example, if Principal He Bingsong of the school had not died and was still in Jinhua presiding over school affairs, the student unrest demanding relocation may not have occurred. Therefore, while we demand the rationalization of the regional distribution of education, we must also demand the rationalization of the distribution of books and equipment; that is, the distribution of books and equipment to schools in places with lower cultural levels, especially universities, should be more and better and more substantial than the distribution to universities in large cities. For example, the recent distribution of teaching equipment for the engineering, agriculture, and medical departments of colleges and universities in the rehabilitation areas subsidized by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should be based on this principle to seek the rationalization of the distribution. The treatment of teachers should also be more generous than that of universities in large cities, and they should be given funds for research and inspection in large cities during the winter and summer vacations, and professors who go abroad for further study should have priority. The winter and summer vacations can also be used to select students of engineering, agriculture, and medicine to practice in large factories and hospitals in large cities, or to learn a scientific technology that cannot be learned locally. Within the possible scope, students can often be led to visit things related to their studies in large cities. The selection of the president of the school should be especially cautious, and the most respected and talented first-class scholars must be invited to preside over school affairs. If we can do this, the university will not be prone to student unrest even if it is run in a place with a lower cultural level or in a remote province. Therefore, demanding the rationalization of the regional distribution of education requires the rationalization of the distribution of books and equipment in order to reform education. In order to seek the rationalization of the regional distribution of education, the education authorities should, according to the needs of society, establish vocational schools or independent colleges related to local construction undertakings in accordance with local conditions, and then slowly expand them into universities as society progresses and local needs increase. It is not necessary to start by establishing a university with more than three colleges. As for the universities concentrated in major cities, if they can be urged to move away from the busy and noisy big cities to smaller cities or remote provinces without universities, and seek the rationalization of distribution, that would of course be very good, but it should not be too forced, so as not to cause storms and student unrest. In this extremely turbulent country, the government's demand for the rationalization of the regional distribution of schools should be approached with caution and should not be rushed in order to eliminate student unrest and stabilize education.</p>
<p>Third, strengthen the supervision system. The educational supervision system is a system in which educational administrative organs set up supervisors to supervise the degree of implementation of education according to legal standards. In the United States, supervisors are divided into two types: one is to supervise teaching, and the other is to supervise administration. Each county and city education bureau has supervisors. The United Kingdom has central supervisors and local supervisors. Each local supervisor must be subordinate to the Ministry of Education supervisor and cooperate with him. In order to compel children to attend school, local governments also set up enrollment supervisors. The supervision system in the Soviet Union is divided into two levels: the federal level and the local level. Federal supervisors are representatives of the Federal Education Committee, and their task is to examine academic affairs and assist in the improvement of public education. The duties of local supervisors are similar to those of federal supervisors, but their supervision area is smaller. In our country's supervision system, the central government and provinces, counties, and cities all have supervisors; however, because of their small number and low quality, supervisors at all levels often take a cursory look and supervise without guiding. When educational problems occur, they cannot foresee them and prevent them, nor can they deal with them well afterward and eliminate future troubles. The recent rise and fall of student unrest, which has shaken the country, is also due to the unsoundness of the supervision organization. Therefore, when we discuss reforming education after this university unrest, we must strengthen the supervision system. At the central level, we should invite first-class scholars with high moral standing and reputation to serve as Ministry-appointed supervisors, and respect their status, give them generous treatment, and send them to universities to give lectures, explain the essentials of learning, being a person, managing affairs, and dealing with people, guide the thoughts and behaviors of young people, so that young people who have heard his words will benefit more than reading books for ten years, and have him introduce famous scholars to give academic lectures at universities, and establish close ties with professors, guide academic research work at universities, solve their difficult problems, and deal with unexpected events that occur temporarily. The Ministry of Education should focus more on the supervision of school administration in higher education, and focus on the teaching aspects of primary and secondary education; the supervision of teaching aspects should focus on whether scientific experiments and practice can be done diligently, and whether exercise books, composition books, experimental reports, and practice reports can be done diligently and carefully corrected. In terms of physical education, emphasis should be placed on whether everyone participates in and holds morning exercises, inter-class exercises, and extracurricular exercises and other fitness exercises every day, rather than training a small number of athletes to compete for trophies. The overall goal is to promote the health of all students through universalization and mass participation. The supervision of local education administration and school administration should have careful and detailed inspections, identify the strengths and weaknesses, and give practical guidance on what should be established and what should be reformed. Special care should be taken to be fair-minded and have a peaceful attitude, and should never be biased or hold a bureaucratic attitude of superiority. Educational workers who are enthusiastic about education and have achieved outstanding results should be reported to the government for rewards. Schools with a long history, excellent results, and great contributions should be reported to the government to increase their funding and enrich their content, so that they can make even better efforts and greater contributions. For example, National Chiao Tung University and Nantong College, a private school, both have a long history and excellent results. The former has made great contributions to the transportation industry, and the latter to the textile industry. If the government can reward and encourage them to fully develop, they will surely make greater and more contributions to industrial construction and the great task of nation-building. As for school-shops, after the supervisors have investigated and confirmed them, whether they are middle schools or universities, they should be reported to the authorities for closure, so as not to mislead people's children and cause harm to the country and society. Supervisors at all levels should establish close ties both horizontally and vertically, and hold more educational supervision conferences to discuss the current educational problems and the ways to solve them, and study how to reform education and other issues.</p>
<p>In short, democratizing education, rationalizing allocation, and strengthening the supervision system are all necessary measures for reforming Chinese education after this university unrest. I wonder what your opinion is?</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Historical Materials on Zheng Chenggong Planned by Tainan Municipal Government</h3>
<p>— Tainan Aviation News, June 30, Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Zheng Chenggong, the representative of the spirit of Taiwan, his great achievements can shock the heavens and move the gods. He is not only respected by the people of this island, but also admired by the heroic figure of the nation, both in the East and the West, in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>The Tainan Municipal Government has decided to hold the Zheng Chenggong Historical Materials Exhibition at Chihkan Tower in the city from the 6th to the 9th of this month. This will be the first exhibition since the restoration, collecting and displaying more than 50 types of historical materials, calligraphy, paintings, photos, printing plates, and historical biographies of Koxinga. In addition, in order to preserve historical sites, the historical museum inside Chihkan Tower will soon begin construction. When former Minister Bai visited Taiwan, he donated money to preserve this historical site. According to Zhuo Gaoxuan, this year's anniversary of the establishment of the Tainan Historical Museum has collected historical documents and literature of the sage Zheng Chenggong and other historical materials from the Ming and Qing dynasties, and is still continuing to collect them. Together with the original historical materials from the Ming and Qing dynasties, there are about 60 pieces. Among them, Chihkan City, Chihkan Tower, Yanping Prince Shrine, and Kaiyuan Temple are all historically famous, and they are very valuable to visit.</p>
<p>Chihkan Tower is located on Minzu Road in Tainan City. It was built by the Dutch in the fourth year of the Ming Yongli period and called Fort Provintia. In 1622, Zheng Chenggong drove out the Dutch and renamed it Chengtianfu. After the implementation of the pacification policy, it was once used as a hospital for the Japanese land and sea garrison and the Joint Southern Normal School. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese Mayor Hatori allocated a large sum of money for repairs.</p>
<p>Zheng Chenggong's five-character handwritten manuscript during the reign of Emperor Longwu of the Ming Dynasty originally read: "Rites, music, clothing, and crown are the first; articles are the home of Confucius and Mencius; Nanshan opens up the land of longevity; the East Sea brews flowing clouds."

<h3>Wells' Early and Late Periods</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Since "The Outline of History" and "The Science of Life" were translated into Chinese (both published by Commercial Press), Wells has become widely known to general readers in China. His early works, with scientific ideals as the center, enjoyed a high reputation internationally. Although literary historians have given the so-called "scientific stories" a "Pseudo" evaluation, in many aspects, they have now exceeded the ideal and are close to the experimental stage.</p>
<p>Lang (author of A Short History of English Literature) commented on his early writings:</p>
<p>"Herbert G. Wells is a sincere writer with a serious attitude towards art, and is one of the most outstanding among the many realists of the same era. He declared that we should take the whole of life as the subject of writing. We should further discuss social, political, and religious issues in a cold attitude until we clarify the thousands of superficial clichés.</p>
<p>"The disputes arising from the discussion of such topics," Lang criticized with some sarcasm, "are simply eleven thousand, even the most discerning ancient Hebrew King Solomon would have to hold his tongue. These problems have become Wells' task and tools. In short, Wells' mission is reform, and his tool is the novel, which is somewhat like an ancient hero driving out demons. We express our admiration for his saving power and courageous confidence. He sees more falsehoods in religion, society, and politics than Carlyle counted—simply nowhere is not 'vague,' and from every vague problem, he must derive a book. Therefore, he is not only a storyteller, but also the main purpose of his twenty or thirty novels is partly scientific ideals——using the seemingly real themes to build Utopias like Verne or More. Later, he published a bright book "Joan and Peter," which clearly depicted Europe's imminent entry into World War I; in fact, he was wantonly attacking modern education</p>
<p>"Like other reformist writers, Wells has his characteristics and weaknesses. His characteristic is that he is very familiar with sociology and science. He cannot use it practically, but he uses it to praise God. His weakness, however, is that the people described in his works lack soul and humanity. In "Marriage," he placed the male and female heroes he described in a small hut away from the city, and proved how possible this beautiful and simple rural life is. In fact, living by a desolate coast is more complicated and less safe than living in a magnificent mansion." Lang believes that "simplicity and purity are not formed by studying science and living by fishing; they come from human nature, and the so-called complexity of life and consciousness is not necessarily the result of urban life."</p>
<p>"In short," Lang felt, "Wells compromised by discussing the defects of reforming society, but in fact lost the good parts of those problems. For example, "The New Machiavelli" only shows how sincerely the author is trying to uncover those false faces. Nevertheless, he is still a good writer, powerful and sincere, but the general shortcoming is that he lacks the attitude of telling stories too much. His most successful work, "The Wheels of Chance," does not have the above shortcomings."</p>
<p>After middle age, Wells' literary works gradually became scarce. "The Shape of Things to Come" should be regarded as a report rather than a story. From an artistic point of view, I think Lang's opinion is still fair, but his scientific themes, no matter how "serious" they are, are more progressive and real than those irresponsible attitudes, and can be ranked above fairy tales as reading materials for young people to cultivate their interest in science. I think that after Wells failed to find a conclusion that could be realized from the power of science, he abandoned his original job and turned to social and political issues——these issues should not be as Lang said: even Solomon should shut his mouth, in fact, it is not impossible to talk about them, as long as we focus on the possible aspects. Like his "The Shape of Things to Come," it is publicly recognized as a successful book, a prophecy, and a good international example. If the international community can really act according to his ideals, why worry about World War III? We are just afraid of looking at Mr. Wells too ideal; he does not transcend reality. The items he shows only depend on whether the peace activists in the international community are willing to do them. I hope that his will can be realized.</p>
<p>Wells is great, seemingly greater than all 20th-century writers, if we put aside the two words of art.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Commemorative Album of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>May 4, 1947, the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association was formally established: this is a happy and congratulatory event! In the feudal era, the capital was often the cultural center: the rulers, in order to consolidate their position, tried their best to absorb talents: the culture produced by the efforts of these talents must be a monochromatic, for-official-use culture. Later, human rights were enlightened, and human dignity was raised high. Culture was no longer centered on individuals——even if it came from several masters, it was autonomous, rational, and not utilitarian——but shifted with the material civilization it created, so major cities became cultural centers: this is the phenomenon that should exist in a democratic era.</p>
<p>Shanghai also became the national cultural center under these conditions.</p>
<p>However, according to the "Treaty of Nanjing" in the twenty-second year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty (1842 AD), Shanghai was opened as a commercial port. In name only, it was "commerce," but in fact, it became a semi-colony: facilities such as concessions insulted our national dignity. The culture produced in such an environment must be a semi-colonial culture, that is, a slavish culture of worshiping money, pleasing foreigners, and low-level tastes.</p>
<p>In World War II, China won international equal status at the cost of blood and flesh. Enlightened allies abolished the unequal treaties that bound China. As a result, Shanghai was restored from a nominal Chinese territory to an actual Chinese territory. However, a truly Chinese-based culture still needs to be built.</p>
<p>In this Shanghai, the national cultural center, and in this unprecedented cultural construction, the Shanghai literary and art writers undoubtedly shouldered a great and arduous responsibility, because literature and art are the education of human emotions, the ploughing of the soul, and the essence of culture.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, Shanghai did not have similar literary and art groups; after the establishment of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, similar literary and art organizations may also be born. For the former, we sincerely wish them healthy survival; for the latter, we sincerely pray that they will multiply; however, for this newly born Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, we truly place the most enthusiastic hope, carrying on the past and opening up the future, hoping to unite the Shanghai literary and art writers together.</p>
<p>The territory of literature and art is like a large garden. Specializing in planting a certain kind of flower, even if it is a famous flower, can be prosperous for a while——but "prosperity" is only "for a while"! Various flowers must be skillfully arranged, so that there are flowers to enjoy in all seasons, and they can be compared.</p>
<p>The road of literature and art is also a broad road. Everyone can walk, and everyone can walk "at the same time." Whoever uses more strength will walk faster, and whoever will walk farther. Those who walk slowly, or stop walking, or even turn their heads back, will inevitably regress or decline. As for those who do not work hard themselves, but vainly try to block others from moving forward, they will never succeed!</p>
<p>The purpose revealed in the "Official Declaration" of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association's inaugural meeting lies in "work" and in "association." It wants to reform the current situation of the literary and art circles, which are fragmented, divided, and self-governing, to eliminate factionalism, to unite friends who are loyal to literature and art, to ask friends in the literary and art circles to participate together, to help each other and cooperate; and then to strive for human dignity, to strive for respect for wisdom, to strive for freedom of thought: all of these, the vision is far-reaching, the mind is broad, and it should be unprecedented. If we follow this path, we will surely be able to build the above-mentioned construction project.</p>
<p>I believe that the colleagues of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association are definitely enlightened, optimistic, and proactive. Although countless material and spiritual difficulties are watching us, all the difficulties of mankind are created by mankind itself, and overcoming these difficulties is our responsibility. I personally am willing to follow the gentlemen of the Shanghai literary and art circles, encourage and work together to promote the literary and art undertakings of Shanghai in our nation-building journey!</p>
<h3>The Song of Twilight</h3>
<p>— Old Kai</p>
<p>As twilight slips off its bronze-colored sleeping gown, and dusk unfurls its milky silk sash, encircling the forest, trailing over the green chest of the valleys and plains—everything is so hazy, that even the white flocks leisurely returning home in the spaciousness are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Yet, everything is so serene.</p>
<p>The shallow pond's angry frogs, the short bamboo thicket's sparrows, abruptly cease their child-like clamor and old woman-like chatter.</p>
<p>The church bell seems to have lost its former modulated resonance.</p>
<p>The streams: some utter murmurs of praise, while others stretch out their slender and pure arms, carrying the clear ringing of silver bells and the rolling of pearl wheels.</p>
<p>Wild grasses dance joyfully in the evening breeze, and the first shy stars open their delicate eyes, peering down from the pale cloud heaps.</p>
<p>Swaying willows plant welcoming banners all along the embankment.</p>
<p>On the edge of the cliff, the dense cedar forest nods repeatedly in emotion.</p>
<p>Even the silent distant peaks unexpectedly add a touch of pink, gifted by the setting sun, to the azure, and reveal a kind of restrained and solemn joy.</p>
<p>The song, like a sea swallow, soars in the boundless blue sky. The song, like a wild horse, gallops across the vast prairie permeated with the fragrance of earth.</p>
<p>This beautiful song, under the heavens and above the earth, creates a dazzling and unparalleled world of illusion.</p>
<p>She broadcasts heroic and marvelous激嚮, making life leap with joy; she also bursts forth with mournful and pure tones, causing emotions to raise a white flag to her, causing emotions to tremble at her feet.</p>
<p>In this tranquil, poetic twilight lane, she runs wild across the sky and fields, flying with the soft silk of love, binding every firm young person and young heart. Wandering travelers must pause for a moment from their hurried steps; travelers rushing through the dust and wind occasionally shake off their fatigue under her consolation.</p>
<p>Listen, listen to this beautiful song.</p>
<p>She can open the doors of our souls, recall those joyful dreamscapes, and purify those decadent emotions and sorrowful memories.</p>
<p>Everything is so hazy, and everything is so serene.</p>
<p>The song sung at twilight seems to be an elusive spirit in the air and mist!</p>
<h3>A Midsummer Night's Dream</h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>Decoration</p>
<p>Golden dawn decorates the sunrise; silvery white clouds decorate midday; crimson sunset decorates twilight, and dark blue stars decorate the night.</p>
<p>Life decorates the earth; fresh flowers decorate the maiden; "The bright moon decorates your window;"—You, you decorate my dream.</p>
<p>July</p>
<p>The starry sky of July brings my beautiful Midsummer Night's Dream.</p>
<p>Those silver poetic days, those stone-like stars, those pairs of limpid eyes, that gentle whisper... a series of blue dream memories.</p>
<p>In the bustling reverberation interwoven with zither melodies and frog songs, when your eyes and the stars in the sky shimmer together, my whistle resounded. By the evergreen dwarf trees, we chased after the fireflies of light…</p>
<p>Now, the starry sky of July is still beautiful, but I hold an empty broken heart, delirious with infinitely enchanting old dreams!</p>
<p>Love Song</p>
<p>A love song is the flying spurt of passion, the overflow of melancholy.</p>
<p>With your heart full of sorrow, sing with all your might, sing out your misfortune, your hope, and also sing out your dream.</p>
<p>Even if there is no girl playing the zither by your side, you can still sing. Please pluck the heartstrings of your shaking head, and sing your lonely, anxious, and fiery love song.</p>
<p>If the night breeze is sentimental, it will carry your song to that distant place.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on Schemes</h3>
<p>— Kengqiang</p>
<p>Poetry is the rising sun, it wants to wipe away the tears that flowers and plants shed in the dark night, and encourage the dome to reveal a cyanic and white micro.</p>
<p>In the fourth poem of "Inscription on Professor Yu Jianhua's Five-Foot Continuous Landscape Painting of Huangshan Mountain," published in this publication on the 6th, the author was "Wang Xiaoqin." The recording and publication were incorrect. This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>National Song</h3>
<p>— Tan Yunshan</p>
<p>In June of the 36th year of the Republic of China, on my fifth return to China from India, the ship passed through the South China Sea to the Taiwan Strait, and suddenly encountered a hurricane. The waves surged, with a force that seemed to overturn mountains and overturn seas. The situation was extremely dangerous. Thinking of national affairs, I composed two poems, "National Army Song" and "National Song." The following is the "National Song":</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; China's rivers and mountains, are so great, China's scenery, is so beautiful.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; China's land, is so fertile; China's products, are so abundant.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; China has the world—the oldest civilization; China has mankind—the longest history.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; We are born here, we eat here; We grow up here, we grow old here.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; Our ancestors, were born here, Our children and grandchildren, will be born here.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; Our gardens, our fields; Our ponds, are all here.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; Our virtues, are love, thrift, and diligence; Our lives, are simple and honest.</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; We don't smoke opium, we don't gamble; We only do good, we don't do evil.</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; Our bodies are strong, our spirits are healthy; Our habits are good, our minds are upright.</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; We must also love—the world and humanity; We must also love—all living beings and all things.</p>
<p>(11)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; Only when China is prosperous and strong, will the world be peaceful; Only when China is prosperous and happy, will mankind be at peace.</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>We are Chinese, we must love China; Prosperity and strength, prosperity and peace; This is our—responsibility and mission.</p>
<p>(On the Donghai Haitian Ship, June 24th of the 36th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<h3>Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 336</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In these more than forty hours, apart from a little rest, I spent most of my time guarding by Ding Jun's bedside, hoping he could wake up for even half an hour, or a few minutes, but I never got this last chance. At the same time, I also used excuses to go to several detention centers to explore the other captured comrades, and also contacted Xu Jun once or twice, but I still couldn't find any trace of Yaoqun and Little Tiger. One thing was very clear: there were no women among the detained comrades.</p>
<p>I went to the puppet police headquarters to inquire, and it was said that the Japanese military police had indeed captured two female spies, but as for where they were imprisoned, I didn't know. Regarding Little Tiger, it was also an instruction from the Japanese military police that there was such a magic fellow who looked like both an old man and a child, who could kill people with evil methods. Three or four Japanese military policemen had been killed by him, and even the wound could not be verified; the puppet government must capture him within a limited time. The puppet police had no choice, regardless of whether he was human or a demon, they hadn't even seen his shadow, so where could they go to arrest him? So they had to use the "reward" method to perfunctorily deal with the Japanese.</p>
<p>I was busy in Tianjin for three days, but I can say that I had no results. The Japanese special agents and military police regarded the cracking of this secret agency as a great achievement. With my little position and influence, trying to rescue the detained comrades was just like the Shanghai people's saying: "Don't even talk about it." Not to mention me, even if Tsurumi himself came, I'm afraid it would be impossible; because the special agents here were under Matsu's command, and we had no internal lines, so we couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>On this evening (the 7th), I received a secret telegram from W Jun, saying that he had gotten news of Yaoqun and told me that it would be best to find a way to return to Beiping as soon as possible. I thought that although I couldn't rescue the detained comrades for the time being, at least I had to reduce their suffering. In the hurried chaos, I arranged two things: First, I got a sum of money, half of which was entrusted to the Japanese military policeman who was in charge of management, telling him to treat these people as well as possible, and telling him that this was the instruction of the action headquarters, and he couldn't disobey. At the same time, I distributed the remaining money to several comrades to make things easier for them. Second, when I left, I pretended to be very serious and talked a few words with the head of Matsu's branch in Tianjin, hinting to him: "These important criminals have many clues, and Staff Officer Aobe received my report and will definitely use them." With these words, that fellow would definitely not dare to arbitrarily impose harsh tortures on them again.</p>
<p>When I rushed back to Beiping, W Jun gave me a telegram and a report. The telegram was sent by Yaoqun from Tianjin on July 3rd, and it was not delivered until the 6th. Although it was a telegram, it was slower than a mail package; it had been deciphered from the code into plain text:</p>
<p>Passed through Tianjin and learned that the secret station had been attacked. We are trying to rescue them, but our strength is insufficient and it is difficult to achieve results. Please send reinforcements as soon as possible. If there is no solution within two days, it will be difficult to [illegible] because Zhang [illegible] still has [illegible] dealings. Release.</p>
<h3>The Rising Tide and the Housing Famine</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Life is almost threatened every moment. We only hear the sounds of "adjustment" and "rising." Everyone is "sighing."</p>
<p>The government is clearly worried about the rising tide as well. Over the past week, working personnel from the municipal government's Economic Supervision Office have been riding around everywhere, strictly prohibiting the black market for gold and US dollars, and successively cutting off the intercom phones in the speculative markets. This all shows that the government has taken emergency measures to "eliminate the rising tide" and stop "price fluctuations."</p>
<p>If the "July rising tide" can be temporarily stabilized by the government's efforts, this is what everyone is 향 to 求.</p>
<p>But to date, the municipal government has not made any rigid regulations on the issue of housing rents in the city, which is really puzzling.</p>
<p>We believe that the existence of the housing rent black market is also one of the reasons for fueling the rising tide.</p>
<p>For a small room, the landlord (actually the sub-landlord) can ask for 10 or 20 million. A house is even 30 or 40 million. Does the municipal government just allow the black market price of the housing famine to be so rampant, so arrogant?</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the "rising tide," the municipal government should consult with local figures to discuss a remedy for the housing famine. At the very least, it should conduct a thorough investigation of vacant houses throughout the city, rigidly stipulate leasing regulations, and, if necessary, send personnel from the municipal government to enforce them forcibly!</p>
<p>The evil precedent of gold bars for Shanghai housing is entirely the act of breaking the law created by Shanghai "sub-landlords." We ask the municipal government to use the strictest laws to break this man-made "gold bar fortress" in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Prelude to the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>The first bullet of aggression was fired late at night on July 7th, almost entering the early morning of the 8th. People in Jiangnan knew about this news when they read the newspapers on the 9th. Before this, songs of resisting aggression had already resounded throughout the country. Everyone expected that one day we would stand up to stop the enemy and drive them out of the Northeast. However, this first bullet did not give people that feeling at first. We silently swallowed too many insults. Maybe this bullet would have to be swallowed as well.</p>
<p>As a result, in the following days, the authorities used diplomacy to deal with military affairs, and would never give up peace until the last moment. The central radio station broadcast the story of King Goujian of Yue. The people demanded to rise up and expel the Wu army, but King Yue always said it was too early, too early. The youth at that time were more anxious than the people of Yue. Even the elderly believed that they could no longer tolerate it. The songs of resistance resounded through the clouds, but diplomacy was still in progress.</p>
<p>The enemy thought this was an encore of September 18th, and they could encompass North China with a sleepy hand. Only the bystanders were clear, and Europeans and Americans began to warn Japan not to bend the bow too strongly. China was no longer the China of the past. At this time, a conference was being convened in Lushan. The sound of the enemy's artillery fire of aggression was like an empty valley without an echo, so the enemy played more and more freely. Perhaps it was like a rattlesnake that had already struck and had no room to shrink back. In mid-July, the central voice came from Lushan. It gradually accelerated from a slow beat, and gradually rose from a low pitch. It gradually matched the voices of the people, and led the people, forming a great chorus of national resistance.</p>
<p>The prelude to the real War of Resistance was thus slowly unveiled.</p>
<h3>The American Vegetable King</h3>
<p>— Yongnian</p>
<p>Readers probably all know that there are major industrialists in the United States, such as the Oil King and the Steel King. Today, I will introduce to you Fred Vahlsing, who operates the American vegetable industry and can be called the Vegetable King.</p>
<p>It is said that most of the vegetables that every American eats, no matter where he lives in the United States, are grown by Vahlsing. Today, Vahlsing's land holdings cover six states in the United States. One vegetable garden in Texas covers 10,000 mu, which can be said to be the largest in the world. There, he grows 500 mu of celery; 1,500 mu of cabbage and 3,000 mu of carrots. He uses hundreds of trucks, trailers and airplanes to sow or harvest. Once, the work clothes he made for his staff weighed 500 tons. He is very knowledgeable about insecticides, climate, freight rates in various places, etc., related to the cultivation and transfer of his products. He is simply like a living encyclopedia. Sometimes, when his business requires him to go out in person, he takes his own twin-engine plane to his destination.</p>
<p>He started in the vegetable business at the age of twelve. At that time, he carried vegetables from his father's vegetable garden in Long Island to New York City for sale, doing twelve dollars worth of business every day, and also selling vegetables for his neighbors, doing sideline business. Later, he took the 10,000 yuan he had accumulated through hard work, plus five pounds of cabbage seeds, and gave them to his friend Keyes. In the hot state of Texas in the South, he sold 200 mu of barren land and began to plant cabbage, which disappeared from the market in the North from November to the coming spring. In the winter of 1927, he first transported cabbage to New York City, which attracted public attention. Restaurants competed to add it to their menus. He gradually expanded his land to thousands of mu. He wanted to plant corn in the same place. Local farmers warned him, saying that there were special pests in that area that would eat up all the corn planted. But he testified: "There will always be a way to deal with it." He followed the expert's instructions and hired 500 workers to drop a mixture of insecticide and heavy oil on each ear of corn. Weeks later, he actually harvested a large amount of winter corn.</p>
<p>Later, he planned to grow potatoes in the eastern United States, so he bought a large piece of marshland that was generally considered worthless and worked hard to operate it. He used bulldozers to dig several miles of trenches and laid down water pipes. Because there were many pests, he had to use airplanes to spray DDT, and he also laid a long perforated steel plate mat near the field as an airport for the airplanes. Months later, he harvested seven tons of potatoes per mu! Two tons more than anyone else's highest output per mu!</p>
<p>Vahlsing's goal is to find new ways to get vegetables from the garden to the kitchen quickly and healthily, which is the secret to his success.</p>
<h3>Telling Jokes While Holding Back Tears</h3>
<p>— Chen Ye</p>
<p>Today's magazine editors mostly feel the difficulty of soliciting contributions. It is even more difficult to find outstanding manuscripts. I think the biggest reason here is the huge pressure that the current broken era has placed on everyone's hearts, making it impossible for most people to have a relaxed mood. In today's difficult life, writers are the ones who find it most difficult to cope with. However, the manuscripts that are welcomed are definitely not those that complain. The more difficult people's lives are, the more they demand the relaxation of newspaper texts. Therefore, newspapers and magazines need beautiful essays, broad expositions, travel life, and so on. There are authors who write for reasons other than remuneration, but those with tragic lives also have to write about "Napoleon's Love Life," etc. In turn, they feel like they are telling jokes while holding back tears. Who knows how much sorrow is hidden behind them?</p>
<h3>On Mutual Understanding</h3>
<p>— Jiankang</p>
<p>"There are acquaintances all over the world, but how many are intimate!" Many friends who have extensive social circles cannot help but sigh with emotion once their efforts fail.</p>
<p>I have thought about it—why are there "acquaintances all over the world," but so few "intimate" friends? Is it possible that everyone in the world is a bad egg, and everyone, including myself, cannot be intimate with others, and is unwilling to be intimate with others?</p>
<p>Now, I have obtained a superficial explanation:</p>
<p>First, because our interactions often cannot be as satisfactory as we would like. For example; when you and I meet, we inevitably exchange a few pleasantries. Before that, it is either through the introduction of others: or we hand over business cards while introducing ourselves: or "Your surname?" "It happens to be..." We ask and answer each other, and try to understand each other. It's good if we already know our place of origin and occupation. Otherwise, according to Chinese custom, we then ask "Where is your residence?" "Where are you doing well?" Well, people with different paths do not conspire together. I am engaged in construction engineering, and you are engaged in education. I work in an administrative agency, but you are covering up your tracks in the financial world. If you speak Cantonese or Hakka, and I am a Sichuanese who has never left the Kui Gate, how can we get to know each other? Isn't it just "I've admired you for a long time, I've admired you for a long time!" "Ha, haha, ha!" From then on, it's over.</p>
<p>This is to say that in addition to acquaintance, there are also barriers in occupation and language, making it difficult to be intimate, and impossible to be intimate.</p>
<p>Second, to take a step back, assuming that you and I, with different hometowns and originally different occupations, are actually working in the same agency due to accidental circumstances, and even see each other every day or have the opportunity to meet and chat every two or three days, but you may be sitting in a high-ranking position, and I am just an assistant, or I am in charge of a certain department, but you are responsible for the ordinary work of another department. In terms of business, life, and other aspects, there seems to be no way for us to care about each other, and there is no need to do so; similarly, assuming that our positions are equal, but because of our work interests, you are busy in the external affairs department, while I am diligent in the internal affairs. Although we do not hate each other, how can we get to know each other from closeness?</p>
<p>This can be said to be having a relationship but not a deep one; if either of us is suddenly transferred or leaves the job not long after, then it is almost like having no relationship, because you and I have not known each other for a long time, so how can we talk about mutual understanding!</p>
<p>In addition, if you and I find that there are major differences in our personalities, tempers, ways of dealing with people, and even habits, hobbies... or even that we are incompatible, then the difficulty of mutual understanding is even more obvious!</p>

<p>Severe Housing Shortage, Solutions Available</p>
<p>The entire world is experiencing a housing shortage after the war, and the United States is no exception. However, some countries appear particularly severe, with China being a prime example. Other countries tend to be more moderate, and the United States is one such example. In the US, no one dares to hoard property for speculative purposes, especially housing. Authorities regularly investigate the population and housing occupancy of each household. If the number of rooms exceeds their needs, the government has the power to mandate that they rent it out. Moreover, the rent is determined by the government based on the location, size, age, and amenities of the house. On average, a furnished bedroom with bedding and utilities costs around $30 USD per month. Once the government sets the rent, that's what the tenant pays, no more, no less. If there are any issues, tenants can report it to the rent control board and have the landlord brought to court.</p>
<p>In addition, many public welfare organizations specialize in helping citizens find housing. These include the Red Cross, the USO, and various military schools and units, as well as housing offices set up at various airfields to solve housing problems for military families. They regularly send people to residential areas to solicit available rooms for rent. American landlords generally have considerable sympathy for those who are stranded and are eager to make spare rooms available to military families. There is no practice of raising rents or gouging them. There are no key money or upfront fees, and it is unheard of to pay a year's rent in advance. Those without luggage can pay first and then move in, while those with luggage can move in first and then pay.</p>
<p>Moving in the United States is very simple, usually just a few suitcases. Furniture and bedding are typically provided by the landlord, which is very convenient for traveling families. Even towels, bath towels, and tableware are provided by the landlord. You can also arrange to have meals with the landlord's family, or you can prepare your own meals or eat at a restaurant. Another option is a boarding house that specializes in providing meals. They have set mealtimes, and you simply go in, sit down, and pay for your meal. These places offer home-style cooking at very affordable prices, around 35 cents per meal. Unfamiliar customers sit around a long rectangular table together, with men, women, young, and old all present. It feels like a large family, and the hostess is enthusiastic and encourages you to eat. You can eat a lot of food for very little money. Chinese people are not very willing to go to such places, because Chinese people value vanity. They would rather spend $1.75 on a rare steak that hurts their teeth. Boarding houses usually have rooms for rent, but because the rent is lower, it is difficult to find vacancies. (Twelve)</p>
<h3>News Clippings</h3>
<p>— Short Compilation</p>
<p>The price of rice in Ningdu, Jiangxi Province, is rising daily, making it difficult even for beggars to survive. The local beggar chief, Zeng Jinlan, went through the streets ringing a gong and shouting, appealing to the government to prohibit the export of rice, and loudly shouting "Help!" Her cries were met with a hundred responses, and hundreds of poor people gathered in the streets, cheering loudly in support. That evening, Yang Jisheng, the owner of Hongye Rice Shop, loaded three large carts of rice to transport to Ganxian for sale. The carts were attacked and smashed by the poor people with stones at the General Gate. The poor rushed to climb onto the carts, and in an instant, the rice was all snatched away.</p>
<p>In Zhongjia Ping outside the south gate of Wugang County, Hunan Province, there is an old lady, Xiao Zeng, who is 128 years old. She has had four sons and six daughters. Only two daughters remain, both over 80 years old. Because the family is poor, they rely entirely on their own labor to make a living. Upon hearing this, County Magistrate Xu specially prepared one stone of white rice, one fat chicken, two catties of pork, and a set of bedding, and personally went with party and group leaders to present the gifts. When County Magistrate Xu arrived, the old lady was just carrying over eighty catties of water back home. Seeing such distinguished guests arrive, she repeatedly called them good officials.</p>
<p>A junior staff member with the surname Wang at the Longhai Railway Administration has served in the bureau for more than twenty years. Recently, he requested the bureau to provide his pension in advance in order to support his family and prevent them from starving. As for his affairs after death, he cannot afford to worry about them in this situation where even making a living is difficult.</p>
<p>The Suzhou City Defense Command has invented a new method of banning gambling:</p>
<p>"If gambling is discovered, once it is confirmed by interrogation, the perpetrators will be punished by being made to stand in a wooden cage, and the cage will be placed in a busy location in Guanqian Street, where they will be forced to stand for two hours as a warning."</p>
<p>The Nanjing Narcotics Prohibition Agency has requested the allocation of thirty police dogs from the Ministry of Interior's Inspectorate General, specifically to be responsible for detecting opium. These police dogs were purchased from the United States and have received special training. They can smell the scent of opium from one kilometer away, follow the scent to search, and once they find someone with the scent of opium, they will bite them tightly and not let go, without fail.</p>
<p>The Fuxing Town Central Primary School in Mile County, Yunnan Province, has recently been experiencing a severe shortage of funds due to the rising cost of living. They have come up with a bizarre idea of setting up a gambling den in the school to profit from it and supplement the school's funds. The school's teachers and staff stand around the gambling venue every day, soliciting customers.</p>
<p>Wang Shufan from Leping, Jiangxi Province, is the only son of the late National Assemblyman He Keling. He is currently twenty-three years old and weighs 348 catties. He is known as the "King of Fat People." He walks slowly, pants when he sits, and often falls asleep after sitting for a while. He has to have blood drawn at the hospital a couple of times a month to prevent a stroke. Recently, upon hearing that there was a "Fat People's Convention" being organized in Nanchang, he came to the province with his family to see the sights. The Nanchang "Fat People's Convention" seized the opportunity of the "King of Fat People's" visit to the province to hold a welcome party, using it as a way to attract attention.</p>

<h3>Genius Mathematician Hua Luogeng</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>One summer more than ten years ago, I first stepped into the beautiful Tsinghua Garden amidst the sound of cicadas and frogs. Everything was new and strange; even the people coming and going were peculiar. For example, there was an old gentleman wearing a blue Chinese-style coat that was neither new nor old, carrying a cloth bundle in his hand, seemingly concerned about something as he went in and out of the library—who knew that this was the world-renowned Mr. Chen Yinke! There was a plump gentleman, with one leg amputated, holding tightly to two crutches, but going up and down the stairs as if flying: this was Mr. Pan Guangdan!</p>
<p>However, what I will never forget is one evening, when the moonlight was like water, immersing the entire garden in an even cooler atmosphere. As the cool breeze passed, it brought waves of cicada and frog sounds—I suddenly heard someone loudly reciting verses from Browning's poems. Circling around from behind the trees to the stream, I saw a young man in his thirties sitting on the white stone bridge railing, with short "flat-top" hair, black-rimmed glasses, clear and a little haggard, gazing at the moon and reciting poetry.</p>
<p>We walked away on tiptoe, and my friend quietly told me: "This is Hua Luogeng from the mathematics department—a remarkable man!"</p>
<p>Looking back again, he may have felt that someone was watching him. He stood up and walked away with a limp, struggling with difficulty.</p>
<p>After that, I often saw him. I learned that he was from Jintan and had never attended university, but his diligent self-study had enabled him to achieve amazing accomplishments in mathematics. His papers were often published in foreign mathematics journals and received high praise. At that time, renowned figures in the foreign mathematics community, such as Hadamard from France (President of the International Mathematical Union) and Wiener from the United States, were lecturing at Tsinghua University. Mathematics professors and researchers from all universities in Beiping came to listen to their lectures. However, these professors and graduate students came less and less often—in the end, it is said that only Hua Luogeng quietly sat in the audience, "competing" with Hadamard on stage, who was gesturing wildly. The news spread among the students, who said that Hadamard was extremely impressed with Hua Luogeng, repeatedly calling him "Professor Hua," while in fact Mr. Hua's title at that time was still only "Instructor."</p>
<p>Everyone said: Hua Luogeng should go abroad, and everyone guessed that his achievements after going abroad would definitely shock the world even more.</p>
<p>At that time, the situation in North China was most urgent. The students in Beiping launched a massive demonstration, shouting the slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism" in the face of Japanese military police with murderous expressions.</p>
<p>Mr. Hua was not good at walking, but in one demonstration, the students found him at the front of the line! Seeing his figure, even the most timid students immediately joined this mighty, mournful, and angry procession!</p>
<p>They were victorious, and Mr. Hua indeed went abroad. Whether it was the United States or the Soviet Union, they all bestowed countless top honors upon him. Domestic academic institutions competed to invite him, but he drifted to the United States again. Recently, I heard that he is consulting about his illness.</p>
<p>Mountains and waters are long—who dares to say that Chinese people are inferior to others? Who dares to say that China has no hope!</p>
