<h3>國軍分路直指臨沂　蘇魯戰局我運用推磨戰　陳毅劉伯誠部被反包圍</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南三日電〕目下蘇魯戰事正形成一極有趣之推磨戰術。據此間權威軍事觀察家羅將軍談：蘇魯戰局，以徐州爲主，國軍以徐東徐西爲二大作戰境地，共軍以陳毅，劉伯誠分據魯南魯西南。截至二日晚，前屬王耀武舊部名將張靈甫部，於一日已克復郯城，進迫距魯共老巢臨沂僅卅華里。另一支郝鵬舉部，亦已渡過沂河，到達指定地點待命前進，臨沂共軍顯已動搖。此係魯南方面。至魯西南方面，共軍劉伯誠部，包括四五縱隊，正南向竄擾民權碭山外圍，此一作戰態勢，國軍自徐州東南而東北，共軍自徐州西北而西南，一面包圍一面反包圍，形成一極有趣之推磨戰術，情勢雖緊，然我始終處於有利地位，如無意外，我軍三日內當可直搗臨沂。反之劉伯誠部之側擊徐州，早在我預料防範之中，共軍此舉徒耗兵力。語至此，羅將軍復笑謂，共軍如避免決戰退入山區，徒見其自詡之棗莊大捷，不過爾爾。而國軍對此則僅認馨南大戰中之序幕戰而已。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州三日電〕國軍收復郯城後，已與津浦綫臨城守軍成特角之勢，在臨城東北之共軍魯南軍區張光中部五個團，棗莊之警衛旅，　縣之張健新十師，以及在臨城與四戶鎭之張華亭新七師，張震第十縱隊，謝祥軍第十縱隊，盡在國軍包圍之中。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南三日電〕魯南共軍自郯城附近失敗後，臨沂已發生動搖，現臨沂通　縣諸城道上，共軍軍運甚忙，連日向民衆征發大批手車大車，自臨沂向後方運輸糧　。又共軍爲增援臨沂老　急待兵力萬餘，由蒙陰南下，刻已達臨沂北卅五八里之青駝寺附近。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州三日電〕魯南越過郯城向北推進之國軍，今日下午進至郯城北四十餘里之沙敦，刻沂河　岸共軍主力紛紛向臨沂潰退，陳毅顯欲避免主力決戰，圖竄往沂·蒙山區·</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州三日電〕流竄豫。皖邊境之共軍劉伯誠部三個縱隊，三日分侵鹿邑，毫縣，　遭國軍某部之反擊。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京三日電〕最近前綫來電稱：配備積良之國軍，正向東南，西南及正南分三路，向魯南共軍據點臨沂推進，該城不久即可收復。南路國軍於昨日克郯城北卅五哩處之大埠後，正向北疾進中，大埠北距臨沂三十哩，距李家莊十五哩，共軍退出郯城後，即在李家莊改編，東南路國軍自贛榆急遽推進，贛　距臨沂僅三十八哩。西南路國軍則自合兒莊直接臨沂。共軍劉伯誠部爲牽制國軍攻勢，在徐州以西豫省東端加緊活動，於攻陷　山後，復移入夏邑，永城一帶，魯省西南國軍，仍佔有濟寗金鄉及荷澤，但已退出單縣，曹縣及定陶。</p>

<h3>平漢北段無變化　保定外圍四鎭共軍集中　平津通車行車效率真大減</h3>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕平漢北段無多變化，東長壽收復說不確，石家莊物價飛漲，十支香烟五千元一盒。保定周圍共軍雲集。保西南白城村大小千莊有共軍三千餘人，東南王家橋，大莊草橋，有四千餘人，東方之藏村，尹村，有三千餘人，北方之馬官營，漕河西岸有四千餘人，西南之五侯有二千餘人，吳城鎮萬餘人，徐水東方之邵莊，吳村，黑龍口共萬餘人，城西北之塘湖，孤山，約二萬人，城西大王店，遂城鎮，謝坊營，有七千餘人。平保電話仍不通，孫連仲仍在病中。又平綏路懷來康莊間大橋前夜被破壞後，路局正趕修便橋，平張車今繼停駛。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕保定三日電；石家莊南國軍，轉有利態勢，辛安仍在國軍控制中，正定情勢緩和，保定北徐水附近共軍仍窺機進犯中。另傳于家莊方面今有戰事。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定三日電〕攻佔定縣共軍，猛撲正定未逞後，急向石家莊四北調動，並以一部主力圖圍獲鹿，切斷石太交通，陷石家莊於孤立。國軍方面現已有萬全準備，並對進犯共軍，予以迎　　聲，　甲車沿綫（石莊至正定頭泉間）巡迥防守，目前石正情况已趨穩定。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕連日破壤平津綫之共軍，國軍到後，大部已向香河逸去，國軍有力部隊趕往三河截擊，平津路基修復處尚軟，且爲單軌，行車效率大减。今晨八時由津開平容車，迄晚六時始到。北平外圍仍不斷有零星共軍擾亂，平西新一中街及平北土城，昨夜皆有共軍活動。大興東南之東櫻村，昨夜到二千餘。通順間之翟縣，亦到千餘人。平市物價受戰事影響，昨今暴漲，美粉每袋達十三萬餘。</p>

<h3>張治中今返皖</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕張治中定四日返皖巢縣故里一行。</p>

<h3>五萬萬美金借款　局勢好轉談判即可開始　借款用途我正草擬計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕關於五億美金借款事，美方前曾非正式表示，盼我對於今後借款用途及穩定貨幣計劃，能有詳細說明。據可靠方面訊，我政府雖未按正式外交途徑接獲此種通知，然對借款用途及一般施政方針，正草擬中，或可於正式談判前向美方提出。據信，我局勢若好轉，談判即可開始。</p>
<h3>國府委會舉行例會　蔣主席親臨主持　接見各部次長埀詢工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國府委會三日上午十一時許在國府會議室舉行一年一度之例會，到孫科，于右任，戴傳賢，及在京府委廿餘人，蔣主席親臨主持，對國府過去一年工作曾有所敘述，十二時許散會，會後主席並在官邸數宴全體委員。又主席今晨曾接見各部次長，垂詢工作甚詳，此亦爲一年一度之例行接見。</p>
<h3>司使普通酬酢　與改組事無關</h3>
<p>左舜生發表改組意見</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕司使三日午宴靑年黨左舜生。據左稱：係普通交際。司使對外傳其活動與中國政府改組有關，表示不愉快。據稱：彼所負者爲美大使職責，對中國內政無從干與。記者晚訪左，請對靑年黨參加改組政府及國共關係發表意見，左表示，靑年黨之參加改組政府，當不以國共在軍事上之進退爲據，而目前之所以尚未確定參加之步驟者，乃在「說來容易做來困難」，故尚待商討後始能決定。記者詢其對改組政府之方式，是否採取全面性的？左稱：然。同時表示，政府對此亦無異議。最後記者詢以如民盟，中共不獲參加，則否決權問題如何解決？左稱：此</p>
<h3>國防部調整機構　成立編制機構調整委會　原則決定裁員百分之廿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國防部以三十六年度國家總預算內，原列軍費以核准數相差甚多，爲節省開支，除遵照整軍方案繼續第二期整軍裁編外，並擬將國防部木部機構調整，業已成立編制機構調整檢討委會，由林蔚爲主委，負責辦理。該委會自成立後，迭經開會研究。據聞此項調整，已有擬議，原則上決定全部裁員百分之二十。爲運用之得法與吾，並非最嚴重之事。</p>
<h3>蔣勻田離為滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕民社蠶蔣勻田，三日晨得雷震自滬來電話，促其即日赴滬，即於三日在車離事。</p>
<h3>滬商業巨子　談經濟情況</h3>
<p>物價正與通貨鬥爭</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨走訪本市某商業界巨子，探詢對於時局之看法。氏謂：因中共之堅拒和談，國內和平之希望殊爲渺茫，至可扼腕。內亂如再延長，中國將喪失苦戰八年得來之國際地位，復興建設之良機，亦將隨之而消逝。爲國家之建設計，爲民族之利益計，一切均希望中共幡然改圖，政治上之目的以政治方法爭取，而放棄目前之破壤政策。本人並非國民黨黨員，但在人民立塲，擁護蔣主席復興建國之政策，而政府以軍事力量恢復交通，亦爲不得已之必要措置。諭及目前之經濟情况，氏謂通貨膨脹，已入惡性循環階段，過年後物價之飛漲，主困在此。</p>
<p>政府掌握食米　可採配給制度</p>
<p>政府現已採用壓制政策，黃金姑不論，食米在上海，市府正在作最大之努力。本人認爲除設法開源之外，必須採取配給制度。因市府已掌握大量食米，可以居住證爲依據，按戶配米，否則米價日漲，貧民將有不能買米之苦，英國自勝利迄今，尚不廢除配　制，堪作我國之　樣。煤之來源並不缺乏，善爲處理，亦不致發生大困難。綜言之，目前物價之壓制政策正興通貨膨脹作鬥爭，國民必須持以鎮定，切勿過於恐慌。在今日之情勢下，經濟之恢復正常，決非短期內所能實現。</p>
<p>輿論運用力量　打擊非法行爲</p>
<p>同時輿論界在此時之責任甚重，因今日社會上對於報紙之重視，與戰前不可同日而語，報紙應運用其偉大力量，協助政府管制物價，打擊非法行爲，決不能於報道之間，推波助瀾，造成人心之恐慌。</p>
<h3>中長路問題　尙在談判中</h3>
<p>〔本報長春三日電〕關於中長路問題，前瀋陽英領使館傳出消息謂，中蘇談判已獲協議，望在京簽字，將有一部蘇籍員工加入中長路工作，現證實不確，該路現有俄人十餘名，內數人爲蘇聯人，惟中蘇確在南京商談中。該路有關方面稱二雙方獲得協議並不如傳聞之快，該路理事劉哲，定三日內由瀋來長視察。</p>
<h3>皖府撥千萬元　派員慰勞陽</h3>
<p>〔中央社合肥三日電〕渦陽於一月六日爲共軍攻陷，盤據五日，糜爛殊甚，被擄壯丁的三千餘，省府特撥一千萬，派員於三日前往慰勞。</p>
<h3>我厲行進口許可證後　美商稱遭受排擠　要求美國務院加以廓清</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約二日電〕頃自此間探悉，美國各大商行駐華代表，近致電國務院，陳述在華經商被排擠之情形，要求加以廓淸。據稱：自中國頒布進口新條例後，被一部份人利用政治壓力，致在經商上受到差別之待遇，其主要實情有二：</p>
<p>（一）美商駐華代表，已不獲領得額定數量以外之貨物進口許可證，面一般半政治或半政府性質之公司，則利用其關係，佔有若千市塲。</p>
<p>（二）此輩公司，復以政治及其他壓力，吸收代理商號，並將美國公司數月及數年前所開始之生在計劃，加以預定。</p>
<p>溯自去年十一月十七日頒佈縫入限制條例後，美商即不獲領得價值五千美元以上貨物之進口許可證，致中國復興所急需之重工業設備雖定貨迄今已將十八個月，亦無法取得輸入許可，同時獨立性之中國商人與美國商行，因申請結滙及許可證，遲遲不獲批准，亦屬損失不貿，因缺乏許可證而被封鎖之合同，計有下述各項貨物：</p>
<p>（一）中國棉紗廠所急需之錠子，計有數十萬枚·（二）羊毛紡織機·（三）建築物上所急需之鋼骨。（四）開鑛經械深井抽水機，起重機等物，均爲中國所急需者。（五）蒸汽動力廠所需之機器。（六）建築飛機塲之航空器材。（七）急需修理交通之鐵路器材及車輪。（八）木漿白報紙及木材。（九）製造桐油，麻油，菜油及其他食油之機器。</p>
<p>中國雖自稱急欲復興私人工榮及恢復貿易常態，但均因此種策略而受其阻滯，且屬違犯中美最近所討論之商務條約。</p>
<h3>綏靖督察團　離鎭轉揚州</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江三日電〕綏靖區督察團第一組長雷殷在錢任務完畢，於三日晨九時率團員廿餘人渡江乘車赴揚州督察，二日後即行北上。</p>
<h3>「抗大」學生王棣　不滿共黨行爲</h3>
<p>投誠後批判共黨</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕共產黨「抗大」畢業生王棣，因不滿共車一切，自動向國軍投誠，並發表「我對共豐的批判」一文。</p>
<h3>外匯調整說　財部無所悉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕外間盛傳外滙有於最近期內再度調整說，能者頃特訪財政有關方面人士，據稱：目前尚無所悉。</p>
<p>魯兩收復鄒城後，津浦路上之臨城與郯城已成犄角之勢，形勢更見重要。圖（上）爲臨城國軍　堡。（下）爲臨淮之街道。</p>
<h3>徐次長談國內經濟　自力更生發展農村經濟　外滙漲落并無多大影響</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕記者三日晚方財次徐柏園，談目前國內經濟情况，徐稱：吾人不必過份重視國際關係，而關心於黃金美鈔之漲落。實則我國之經濟坦途，乃在發展農村經濟，正視現實，自力更生，外滙之漲跌與國家經濟並無多大影響。記者詢以外間盛稱，如美國五億元貸款不能成立，則國內經濟將遭遇莫大之危機，政府將如何措置？徐稱：吾人應澄淸觀點，不必以此爲問題，吾人決可自力更生。</p>
<h3>廖燿湘對記者談話　接收大連無問題　鄭副長官視察農吉防務</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日電〕廖司令官湘湘對記者談稱：大速接收在軍事上無問題，陸路水路均可前往，行政人員如肯率少數警察，即可至大運執行接收工作。蘇軍因有條約及友好關係，必不能加以阻碍，同時亦不能支援共軍。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日電〕廖耀湘談東北當前唯一急務，爲認眞推行縣政，如此松花江南共軍無活動餘地矣，否則一切均無辦法。遼東半島民衆發揮之力量爲一最好例證，行政人員需負起責任</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日電〕此間人士近頗以大連接收人員，遠在京滬間遲遲不前爲焦慮。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日電〕蘇軍在石河以南旅順大通間，似爲兩個師，約有兩萬餘人，如國軍前進，可能即撤至旅順及條約規定之地區，共軍在石河以南及大連，明暗號稱五萬人，但目前已無較大力量，補給運輸均大感困難。</p>

<h3>編製年度決算要點　政院令所屬機關遵照辦理</h3>

<p>甲·編製期限：（一）各機關尙未編送卅三年度決算者，應由第二級主管機關於卅六年二月底以前，補編完成，以三份送達主計處，另一份呈送該管第一級主管機關。（二）各機關尙未編送卅四年度決算者，應由第二級主管機關於卅六年三月底以前補編完成，以三份送達主計處，另一份呈送該管第一節主管機關，如第一級機關本機關尙未編送卅四年度決算者，應於上項限期內編成，以三份送達主計處。國民政府直轄各機關之決算，準照前項限期編送，公庫決算，軍費決算及歲入總決算，均限三月底以前編遂主計處。（三）各機關三十五年度決算，應由第三級主管機關於卅六年五月底以前彙編完成，以四份　送該管第二級主管機關。（四）各第二級主管機關，應將主資之卅五年度決算於卅六年六月底以前彙編完成，以三份送達主計處，另以一份呈送該管第一級主管機關。各第一級主管機關本機關之決算，應於前項限期內編送，國民政府直轄各機關之決算，準照前項限期編送，公庫決算，軍費決軍及歲入總決算，均限於六月底以前編送主計處。（五）以上各項限期、應由各該主辦會計人員負富趕辦，不得遲延。</p>

<h3>社論　大連問題的癥結</h3>
<p>大連市長龔學遂一昨在京與新聞記者談接收大連問題時稱：「大問題不解決，小問題無從談起。最近市府派人赴大連市視察，市內有中共軍四五萬人，蘇軍未駐在市內。市內糧食缺乏，且有餓斃者」。龔氏續稱，「渠在京亦頻與彼得羅夫大使晤面，大使曾詢何時前往接收，蓋水陸兩路，皆可前往，問題在共軍，如僅派少數人前往，則不能接收，如派軍隊協同前往，則勢必與共軍發生大衝突」，另據報載消息，關於大連接收事，重心爲：（一）接收之日人產業如何由中蘇雙方接管問題；（二）治安如何由中蘇雙方維持問題。後者聞已吿解決，前者據說意見大有出入。與大連市長發表談話的同時，從美國方面傳來的消息，也提高我們對於大連問題的關注。</p>
<p>美國共和黨籍參議員白里奇斯最近發表他關於美國外交政策的聲明稱：「在世界的另一角落，蘇聯方面的活躍，也大可注意。滿洲的刦奪使中國的發展要倒退好幾代。有一個偉大的强國在中國作殊死戰的時候袖手旁觀，一直到日本戰敗的這一個星期內纔參了戰，而現在却控制着中國的港口，鐵路，及城市。這是美國的壓力使中國放棄了大部分的土地和主權。爲答報起見，莫斯科明白地應允協助中國的國民政府及其軍隊接管滿洲及其他地區的統治。因此，美國不能對於俄國的不履行前言及其不以一個盟國而以彷彿一種戰敗國的態度對付中國這一宗事實漠不關心」。同時，美國霍華德報又稱：「我人已在波蘭與南斯拉夫等地得見莫斯科式之「聯合政府」，實不欲再見此種聯合政府之出現。美蘇在遠東殊有成立協定之必要，然首需撤退在朝鮮·滿洲及中國各解放地之美蘇軍隊，如是則各該國之人民纔得依照其一己之需要與志願，自由組織其自己之政府。對美蘇而言，此爲解決遠東問題惟一眞正民主之方式」。</p>
<p>現在美國旣聲明放棄調處，準備撒離駐華軍隊，而大連的接收，到今天還沒有端倪；這實在令人扼腕。據大連市長的談話，大連市內並沒有蘇軍，卻駐有中共軍隊四五萬人，依照三十四年中蘇友好條約的精神，蘇聯有協助中國國民政府接管大連統治的義務，但一年多來，蘇聯似乎不但未曾給予前項協助，且更容許反抗中國政府的武力政權在大連建立起來，這實在是一件很遺憾的事。至所傳接收之日人產業如何由中蘇雙方接管一點，實在不應成爲問題。日人在大連的產業，依理應由中國接收，那是不應該成爲問題的問題。如果在事實上，日人在大連的產業，這一年多來，已面目全非，那亦不是不可以商談來解決的，似乎不能因此而延緩大連的接管。</p>
<p>關於大連問題，猶憶上月三日美政府曾照會中蘇兩國政府，要求中蘇兩國實施中蘇條約關於大連的協定，俾大連在中國政府管理之下，恢復正常狀態。在這一個照會裏：「美國政府承認此一問題應由中蘇兩國舉行直接談判解決，但美國爲一般利益計，美國不得不認爲本身也負有將此一問題向直接有關二國政府提出之責任。」當時本報曾著論請中蘇實施關於大連之協定：「希望蘇聯能反躬自省，珍惜中蘇兩國人民間的傳統友誼，切實履行中蘇間的一、切條約。」可是前項照會的發出，距今已一個多月了，而大連的接管依舊還沒有威爲事實。</p>
<p>據木連市長的表示，伊與彼得羅夫大使經常保持接觸，而中蘇代表現又再度在普蘭店會商中，是則關於大連的接管的進行，並不曾有什麼停頓。由於美國最近有準備撤離駐華軍隊的聲明，我們希望爲履行中蘇友好條約的精神，除該條約有規定者外，蘇聯在華的駐軍亦應從速撤離，至於在蘇軍勢力圈內的反政府武裝政權，允不應任其存在，更應及時予以消滅。那末，大連的接管，當可及時實現。</p>

<h3>聯合國安理會今日重開　美蘇意見未趨接近</h3>
<p>裁軍及管制原子能兩案又臨試騐</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三日電〕美國對於普遍栽軍及原子能管制問題，態度堅決，此事將在明日安理會遭退考騐，但由目前局勢發展情形視之，其進行未必能順利。第一，蘇聯眞理報稱，美口之原子能管制方案似將被否決。安理會具有否決權之五國，除蘇聯外，均已接受美國方案，則該報此曾等於蘇聯平備加以阻撓。第二，美國方案曾預先向其他各國代表提出，多表示冷淡，日引起蘇聯之堅決反對。但形勢雖屬不利，美代表奧斯汀不擬變更初衷。奧斯汀之方案，係與杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿會議後草成，聞華盛頓方面對於奧斯汀與各代表初步討論結果，接獲充分報吿。蘇聯堅持制裁任何原子管制違約國時，應保留否決權，美國則一再聲明應取消之。奧期汀之方案包括三點：（一）立裁軍委員會，此一委會須不干涉原子能委會之工作，或處理任何大規模破壞之武器；（二）先設一起草小組會，訂定裁軍委會之工作範圍；（三）安理會下屆會議時，討論原子能委會提出之報吿書。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴的摩爾城三日電〕美參議員狄亭頃發表廣播演說稱：原子彈縱加以禁止，但萬一發生戰爭時，殆仍將加以使用。聯今國旣不能在兩次戰爭問之和平期內，將原子彈視爲非法，則爲一勞永逸計，應設法消滅此一武器。此事應與一般裁軍問題連帶解法，不應單獨加以處理云。</p>
<h3>杜魯門之新作　循正常外交途徑　解決國際間紛爭　馬歇爾赴蘇途中將訪德奧　貝文不擬由空路赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日廣播：三强巨頭會議係故羅斯福總統在戰時所採用之制度。據可靠方面消息：杜魯門總統已放棄此種制度，並主張採用正常「外交方式」或外長會議，解決國際間問題。杜魯門總統雖宣稱，若史達林與艾德禮能蒞至華府，當可舉行三巨頭會議，但實際上杜總統即對三巨頭在華府舉行亦認爲不需要，渠以爲渠應與各國領袖個別晤商，且不能將法國置諸度外，此外美國務院高級官員均反對巨頭會議，認爲此種會議，無異替外交人員越俎代謀。彼等且指出此種會議不應舉行之理由如次：（一）巨頭會議祗應在戰時舉行，（二）巨頭會議，可能引起秘密條約之謠傳；（三）巨頭會議對於民主國家並不適宜，祗對獨裁國家如蘇聯者有利；（四）巨頭會議實係蘇聯劃分世界之公式</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三日合衆電〕據息，馬歇爾或在下月赴德奧一行。據有資格之美國人士稱，馬歇爾將在三月十日莫斯科外長會議前，訪德奧二國，以便親自考察軍事佔領之各項問題。</p>

<h3>對奧和約問題　蘇態度不明</h3>
<p>四外次會議又遇障礙</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：英外部對四外次會議之前途，表示樂觀，認爲該項會議已完成一半。但美方觀察則不以爲然，認爲蘇聯故意阻延奧大利和的之簽訂。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕締結對奧和的之前途，似有賴於蘇聯在本星期內外决會議中是否肯作讓步。據可靠方面談稱目前對奧和約工作之三項主要障礙，爲（一）在奧德兩國產業之處理問題，及（二）應如何保證奧國將來不致與任何國家合併問題。據悉，蘇聯是否願意在締結對奧和的之後九十日內撤退駐奧蘇軍，可於本淍秒決定之。如果蘇聯願意如此，則　他三强當不致猶豫不撤其駐軍，而法軍且願更早日撤退云。</p>
<h3>消除懼共心理　美蘇始能合作</h3>
<p>羅斯福夫人見解</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約三日電〕羅斯福夫人今日在「觀望雜誌」發表一又稱：美國必須儘可能消除對共　主義之恐懼與憎厭，而後方可　蘇聯合作，猶如與英國之合作然。英聯兩國在政治與經濟之觀點上，均與我國不同，然此種觀點並非一定不變者。蘇政府對於美國之共黨並無任何援助或慰藉。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統昨咨請國會　食糧管制展延一年　戰時三類特權法案亦予延期</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日合衆電〕社魯門總統今日咨文國會，要求對極感缺乏之食糧及工業原料之管制展延一年，現行運輸航運規則亦予保留一年。杜氏並要求三類戰時特權法案之期限，延至一九四八年三月三十一日，是即（一）規定配給優先之權，此項法案之繼續極爲緊要，因榖物·麵粉·米糖·糖漿·脂肪·油類·肉類·牛乳產品·豆類·魚類·金雞納樹·皮類·有機鹽基類·橡皮織維類·蔴類·錫銻等仍形缺乏·（二）准許航務委會經營若干航綫，在公司交通不便之處，准許陸海軍在當地運轍其服務人員。（三）准許在現行限制中之規則下，進行航運，（規則係關於設備及人員者）。杜氏稱，此點對駐在海外之軍隊之復員及供應運輸均屬必要，且與遣送歸國之問題有關。杜氏稱，如各項管制繼續展延，其廢止之期當儘速爲之。</p>

<h3>諾維柯夫演說　強調美蘇親善　免致被人混水撈魚</h3>
<p>〔聯合社佛羅里達州米亞米二日電〕蘇聯駐美大使諾維柯夫今日在美蘇親善協會米亞米分會發表演說，謂近使美蘇關係漸趨黑暗之陰影，並非兩大民族間事態之眞正反映。一九四六年發生之新戰爭恐慌，係由於「若干政團」所造成，藉以鼓吹新戰爭，播種不安與猜疑，俾可混水撈魚。英前首相邱吉爾即爲其中之一，曾公開或嬌飾出現，從事有組織之阻礙，且唱導「同盟」對抗蘇聯。諾氏並强調對美友誼稱，蘇聯人民對美人民之協助與輝煌戰績，極表感佩，決不淡忘。在爭取勝利打倒公敵中担任重要職務之四國人民間友交，處於今日和平時期，應担任更偉大之任務。</p>

<h3>法政府召回河內區司令　對越政策或將轉趨軟化</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎三日電〕法政府於二日電召河內法軍司令馬拉利將軍返國，此足證法內蘭準備對越南採取和平政策·馬氏今日啓程離河內返巴黎，同時越南東京省法專員賽泰納已飛赴西貢會晤越南高級專員達香禮歐。但此間尙未佈露馬氏返國之原因，惟悉昨晚賴　迪與其高級軍事及政治顧問檢討越南局勢二小時之久，其後即發表召回黑氏之命令。雖法殖民部慕台稱，上項會議係討論運輸與撤退僑民事宜，但據法方報界觀察，法政府認爲以和平方法解決越南事件之時間已告成熟。法軍雖獲得初步成就，而某觀察家之意見認爲法政府擬採取與維明政府妥約之政策，撤換軍人總督，由文官出任。按撤換達香禮歐及其他官員係維明總統胡志明所提出之主要要求之一。</p>

<h3>英法締盟面面觀</h3>
<p>英法兩國如能正式締結盟約，對於維護歐洲的安全與和平，當能有所貢獻，但其意義，還不如英蘇盟約來得大，最近蘇聯對該的態度的曖昧，頗使歐洲許多國家不安。</p>
<p>法總理勃魯姆訪問英倫之後，接着就公佈了英法將締結同盟約消息，這似乎是有點突如其來。但這種協定的本身，毫無驚奇之處。英法政府早就幾次三番表示願意締結盟約，不過由於法國內閣過去曾堅持要在該談判前提出條件，因而未果。</p>
<p>英法談判締約經過</p>
<p>當歐洲解放不久之後這個問題被提出時，因爲戴高樂將軍正因叙利亞與黎巴嫩的事件大爲不快，因而堅持必須先將該兩問題先解決之後不願考慮盟約的談判。不僅如此，他又進一步要英國支持他所提出，將萊茵區和魯爾區與德國分離的　求。但英國却不願意買這筆賬。</p>
<p>戴高樂去年辭職了。　任的古安倒是很贊成結盟約。不過，皮杜爾還是當時的外交部長，他還是主張必須英國支持法國對萊茵區的要求而後才能談到條約。結果，在古安與英國各部長認爲惋惜的情形下，條約的主張再度作罷。貝文在下議院報吿說：一兩國結盟必須無條件的以雙方友誼爲根據。」這一决勃魯姆對於這個問題抱了一個比較廣大也更現實的態度，因而原來成問題的就不成問題了。</p>
<p>歐洲三強結成一體</p>
<p>除非有意外的困難發生，否則這一次的英法談判應該是非常簡短的。因爲大家都認爲英法條約也該和英蘇條約以及法蘇條約的格式相同。等英法條約簽字之後，那麼歐洲三強就可以在將來萬一德國東山再起時，互相援助。不過一般人心裹都不免發出這個問題：這個三國聯盟約制度是否在事實上和在紙上一樣的堅强呢？我們切不可忽略幾種令人不安的徵象：其中最顯然的是在三角聯盟中佔一重要地位的蘇聯。最近對聯盟一事，竟斷然的缺少熱情的表現</p>
<p>貝文眞義遭蘇誤解</p>
<p>第一層，貝文外相提出將英蘇條約的期限由二十年展期爲五十年的建議時，蘇聯政府竟未置答。蘇方報紙反而問，這一紙條約，不管是二十年或五十年，究竟有多大價値？最近，蘇聯共產黨官方報紙更斷早取義的，指責貝文在聖誕節夜的演說中否認條約的義務。其實貝文所說的，無非是解釋英國政策不受美國政策束縛的一點。他說英國政策除了應履行聯合國大憲章的義務之外，不受任何國家的東縛。這個涵意是很明顯的，尤其是英法蘇的這幾個聯盟都斷然地被英國看爲是聯合國體糸的一部分，他們的義務當然就是在憲章義務範圍之內的。</p>
<p>但這一句却被蘇聯曲解了，要使全世界—連德國在內—知道安全機構內至少有一部分已經不活動了，或蘇聯已將這一部分看爲是不活動了，不過我們注意到，如果莫斯科方面對於貝文這句話的意義眞正担心的話，他們爲何不立刻要求英國「說明」呢？他們旣不詢問，也不要求解釋，却在演說發表了三個星期之後，突然發動了攻擊。</p>
<p>蘇聯態度令人不安</p>
<p>蘇聯這種行動的動機何在，我們不大淸楚。但其結果之一則是非常明顯的。這麼一來，就不能不引起德國國家主義者的希望。他們想，安全機構或者不過是虛有其表，如果德國對蘇聯不斷表示的友誼作相當的反應，或者不久蘇聯就能由看管人而變成朋友，甚至於在將來德國與西方國家發生衝突時再進而爲守中立的國家。</p>
<p>如此說來，歐洲安全制度之不健全，就在於蘇聯盟國以及德國這種暖昧不明的態度。如果蘇聯能明白宣佈政策，並接受英蘇條約展期至五十年的建議，則比答央法條約更能加強歐洲的安全性了。（英國E·N埃佛原著）</p>

<h3>穗平蓉滬兩航綫間　計劃闢四十九機塲　機師認爲不切實際</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司飛行人員，最近組織一飛行員協會，參加機師，副機師，領航，無綫電報務員等美籍六十五人，華籍一百五十人。昨晚該會舉行第四次常會，討論民航局最近擬具之改善飛行計劃及其他有關民航事宜。</p>
<p>按該協會曾於三星期前上書蔣主席宋院長俞部長載局長等，建議各航綫所經之無綫電通訊及一切航空設備，應由政府統籌密切合作運用，任何領照之飛議，遇有緊急意外時，可在任何機塲降落·民航局在上星期五宣佈一計劃，擬沿自廣州至北平及上海至成都（包括昆明支綫）南北東西兩條航綫，開闢小刑機塲四十九處，此可視爲對渠等建議之間接答復，但此項計劃，估計須在十個月後始能完成，而有經騐之機師則認爲太過浪費，不切實際云</p>

<h3>見之古籍　屢試不爽　立春夜試豎雞蛋　外記者如醉如狂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日是我國農曆立春，根據我國古籍「通天鑑」和「科學花鏡」二靨所載，在這一天，鷄蛋能够豎立不倒，而且不論大小頭，都可以。</p>
<p>昨晚十一時四十五分，是立春開始的時刻，國際宣傳處上海辦事處主任魏景榮家中，集合了許多外國記者，合衆社的倫道爾，國際新聞社的威爾士夫人，讀者文摘社的佛蘭克蕭等。他們紛紛匍在地板上豎鷄蛋，情緒之熱烈，如醉如在，興奮萬分。</p>
<p>據魏君說，鷄蛋在任何時候都能够豎立，不過在立春的時候，特別容易。前年立春，他在家中招待外國記者，表演豎鷄蛋，洋人們大爲興奮，「生活」刊出了照片以後，哄動整個美國，直至今日，熱情不衰。據報載，紐約的鷄蛋，又被道批「豎鷄蛋客」，搜購一空了。</p>
<p>鷄蛋不僅在泥地上能够豎立，水門汀上，地板上，桌子上，玻璃板上，鏡子上，茶杯上，都能够直立不倒。</p>
<p>使鷄蛋豎立，所需要的時間不等，有的凑巧，一放下去就豎立；有的則需一二分鐘的耐性和工夫。當然也有豎了一個鐘頭才豎起的。據記者的觀察，使鷄蛋豎立，首需鎭靜。</p>
<p>至於它的原因何在，現在還沒有確實的答覆，而大科學家愛因斯坦曾斥「鷄蛋能在立春豎立說」爲胡說八道。</p>
<p>記者聽到的解釋，有好幾種，茲「姑妄言之」。一種說法是立春時，空氣濃度特密，所以容易豎立。一種是「立春」前後，地下有一種「陽氣」上升。還有一種說法是蛋黃凝聚下沉之故。但這多是不可靠之論。正確的解說，還有待於科學家的研究。（圖示豎鷄蛋熱烈情形，本報攝）</p>

<p>據衛生局方面稱：目前市所有運送垃圾之工具祇爲戰前所有三分之二，工役祗爲戰前五分之三，經費依三十五年下半年物俱指數計算，祇爲戰前三分之二，然垃圾之生產量則較戰前增加三分之一。衛生局爲经費所限，工作無法展開。清道夫待遇低徵，故於年節常有向商戶索取酒資之舉。雖經公吿嚴加取締，事實上恐仍難免。故前曾建議設置清追捐或淸潔捐，以所得改善追夫之待遇，使之安心工作，取能增加工作效率。此項捐稅，在內地城市，亦多設置。然終爲市參議會所否決。戰前本市居民五百人中有一清道夫，然目前則需八百人中方有一人。敵僞時期於南市閘北廢墟遺留積存之垃圾的共十萬噸，然爲經費所限，至今無法淸除，目前祗能做到不再加上去而已。</p>

<h3>南匯農婦慘死　屍棺移滬覆驗　致死眞相明瞭　委係生前落水</h3>
<p>轟動一時之南滙縣親夫謀斃髮妻案，該管司法機關，因無覆騐設備，爰於昨晨將棺抬至上海林森東路同仁元堂騐屍所覆騐。</p>
<p>緣有南滙坦直橋鎭西北孫家牆圈農民孫梅根，年四十一歲（曾在敵偽時期充當僞鄉長），娶妻顧氏，即顧小妹，又名顧金英，年四十二歲，過門迄今，已有廿四年。平時夫婦情感甚好，生有三男二女，均已長大。孫性好漁色，曾任偽職時與木匠阿七之妻閔新娟姘識，在外賃屋同居，雙宿雙飛，儼若夫婦，視糟糠妻似眼中釘。上年十二月六日淸晨，忽發現孫顧氏慘死於附近小河浜中，當經邱鎭長鍾彬呈報新塲公署，轉呈縣司法機關，於十二月八日，派員下鄉檢騐，騐得該屍並無傷痕，委係生前落河身死，據情呈報後，由該屍親族姪顧裕冰等，認爲死者於生前曾經向姪兒輩等言明「吾必病死，決勿自殺」等語，此次突然慘死，定遭謀害，况其本夫亦避不見而，呈請司法機關要求覆騐伸雪，當經司法機關准詞覆騐，將屍抬至上海同仁輔元堂騐屍所，於昨日上午十一點時，由地方檢察處法醫主任魏立功，偕同法醫龔自爲蒞塲覆驗。常由縣司法警長偕同屍族等，亦到塲觀看，旋由伕役將屍身從棺不中取出，已經薰黑，陳屍於木橙上，遂經魏法醫等用手術將屍體解剖，所有心肺等取出，歷時一點半鐘，手續完畢後，即命屍　收殮，其時屍族方而爲急欲明瞭致死眞相起見，叩問魏主任死者是否係死後遺屍河中，抑或生前落河身死，當據魏法醫答日，本屍據觀察所得，係屬生前落河身死，原因：（一）發現該屍體在河浜中浮起時背部向上，腹部向下，倘若死後落河，乃是反比例。（二）現今騐得該屍肺胃內有水份，如若死後落河，肺胃內決無水份云。</p>

<p>債務糾紛</p>
<p>陳良問鄙人於前年七月間向友人借得僞鈔三十萬元，　明半月爲期，並以本人之支票一紙作爲交換抵押，屆期因敝人經商失利，故無法淸償，一月後，鄙人即凑足僞鈔三十萬元，先歸還其本，並懇請利息於他日補奉，今友人忽向鄙人要求歸還國幣陸十萬元，並謂前付之僞鈔三十萬元，只能作爲利息之用，請問（一）當時之僞鈔現以法幣歸還，應照何種比例折合？（二）是否依復員後辦理民事訴訟條例第十二條辦理？（三）如按照第十二條辦理，請將該條內關於敝人債務之條文示知。</p>

<h3>調查大火卷宗　彙呈市長批閱　消防員指紋限今日捺送警局鑑別　密告箱後天當衆開啓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案調查工作今後重心將轉入行政司法之檢討與防範補救方案之義訂。行政方面，調委會已將一部份整理就緒卷宗由主任委員葛克信呈吳市長審閱。葛克信謂：市長批閱案卷之後，表示頗多感觸，將有具體意見提供。警局亦已將凟職扣押人員有關之卷宗，送市府秘書處轉呈吳市長。司法方面，於前日由江寗路警局移解地檢處之　賀職嫌疑犯消防員五名亦由張檢查官一度開庭偵訊，各被吿供詞，顯多閃避，關於防範補救方策，據警局督察處長張達稱：「調委會擬即發動舉行市民防火總檢查，一般咸認，上海淪陷八年，房屋陳舊與消防設旅損壞，爲大火延燒之先天缺憾，因而各戶對於宅內之電綫·爐灶·引火物等詳細檢查並加以補救，自是當務之急。」葛克信並定後日赴各消防處參觀，彼謂：我等於消防工作雖係門外漢，然能實地參觀一下，於事或不無小補。</p>
<p>昨日下午四時，調委會在蔡保長家傳西摩路國民小學教員陸鳳潛有所詢問，據稱：彼確於學校後門，見一矮胖男子手舞足蹈述說消防員偷竊之事，該胖人有謂：「親見一個中國憲兵因爲救火員口袋裝得滿滿的，站在火旁　看一拳打過去，一隻小巧的鐘便掉了下來，憲兵再在救火員身上踢一脚，又有別的東西落下來。」此說前日雖由憲兵宋志鵬予以否認，然陸鳳潛則稱：彼或能於附近尋獲此胖人，而加以證實。</p>
<p>今日工作</p>
<p>今日尙須進行之調查工作爲：（一）令參加西州　施救工作之消防員，限今日捺畢指印，送警局鑑識科檢直，俾能獲知留於木櫥上指印，是否與消防員有關。（二）市長命張達於今日起督促翻扒火塲，詳爲檢騐足資參考之灰燼，此項工作，據張達估計，三日內可吿完成。</p>
<p>盼望密告</p>
<p>此外，調委會甚吩災戶及火塲周圍鄰居，勇於將其耳聞目見所及資料，投函於西摩路順昌南貨號門首之密吿箱內，調委會爲表示公正無私起見，昨　以密吿信箱鑰匙一把封　信封內，由各調查委艮分別　名後，妥爲保管，該信箱定於六日上午十時當衆開啓。</p>

<h3>五消防員　開始偵訊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案中涉嫌消防員戴光榮，尙志魁，李成鈞，蔡志英，黃實琪五人，由吳市長手諭警局拘押後，已於前日下午二時四十分解送地檢處，其時適星期例假，由地檢處値日檢察官張鎭元略訊案情，即諭收押。昨日下午二時再由承辦檢察官沈祖壽正式開庭偵查，據聞五消防員均矢口否認有趁火打刦之行爲，並稱，火勢正延燒時，彼等均不在塲。係於初二正午前往火塲接班，至於拿取毛巾，稱係別人給他們擦水龍頭的。四時廿分退庭。五消防員仍　押於看守所。據沈檢察官稱：五被吿對趁火打刦一節，皆不承認，自在意中，檢察處必全力偵查，務求水落石出。今日或將再訊，唯似查過程現尙不便發表。</p>
<h3>災戶陸木匠　哭訴調查會　不堪餐風宿露　要求免拆棚屋</h3>
<p>武定路四二五號（即起火之銅匠作）內一居戶陸世君，業木匠，昨日赴蔡保長寓所向火災調查委員會哭訴，因大火之後，房屋傢具衣被等日常必需品，盡付一炬，又因無處棲身，即於火傷上搭蓋棚屢一所，以避風雨，詎市工務局以其與行政法令有遵，故勒令於七日以內拆卸，陸氏以該棚屋之得以築成，實係親友五萬十萬零星接濟。一旦勒遷，必將無地容身，一家老小，行將遭餐風宿露之苦，故特向調委會哭訴，希望當局能鑒諒彼等不幸之遭邁，而特予通融。</p>
<p>對於消防員是否有行劫行爲陸氏亦堅不願吐露，備謂曾親見消防員自相打架，一個要將水龍拖往橡膠廠灌澆，另一個則堅不放手。其他情形，因非目睹，道聽塗說者不能作證。</p>
<p>陸報吿彼於大火中搶救雜物時稱：衝進熊熊大火中共計四次，第一次搶出一條被頭，第二次搶出一輛脚踏車，第三次搶出一輛老虎車，第四次搶出一塊鹹肉。主委突問：「金鋼鑽戒子搶出沒有」？陸氏一時瞠目不知所對。蓋葛氏因災戶代表於昨午假大西洋亞菜社招待會中，王雲甫之小姐文英，當衆報吿曾搶出十八克拉之鑽戒二枚，葛氏即以此與陸世君開開玩笑也。</p>
<h3>一件舊號衣　值得玩味</h3>
<p>又武定路廿七號災戶顏澤之曾於火災翌日，於衣堆中檢獲號衣一件，顏氏當時即疑心係爲消防員刧去渠之衣服後所遺下者，經送調委會轉警局刑事處調查結果，並非消防員之制服，而係警察之舊號衣，可能經由舊貨攤之手，流於他人服用，然旣在火塲，當與火災有關。警局或不難獲悉服用之人，蓋衣服上猶綴有舊號碼也。</p>
<h3>理髮店擱樓火燒　焚斃嬰孩</h3>

<h3>太古浦西碼頭　工人爭執僵持</h3>
<p>盛京輪過駁卸貨</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕太古公司浦西碼頭棧房工人，爲爭奪工作，於上月二十六日起，工頭周瑞蓀率領工人百餘人，至碼頭棧房要求工作，現任工頭陳善餘方面不肯退讓，致起爭執。本月一日盛京輪到埠，停靠太古浦西三號碼頭，於下午四時啓艙卸貨，周方工人即守候碼頭爭奪工作，雙方又起爭執，後經警察大隊及憲兵到塲彈壓，始告平息，該輪旋亦停止卸貨。前日該輪擬再起卸，不料變方工人即發生衝突，警察鳴槍，始各散去，結果變方互有受傷，該輪遂又中止卸貨，昨日該公司爲船期關係，改變卸貨方法，用駁船在外檔過嚴，起入浦東楊鐵渡棧房，雙方均各無奈，對爭勢仍相持中。</p>
<h3>减輕五年徒刑仍不服　郁香巖聲請再審　根據兩點申辯有新證據提呈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理局材料處舞弊案中，「處長太太」郁香巖經地院初判有期徒刑十五年，後高院改判爲十年。把郁香巖又延聘王伯憲律所向高院盤請再審，其呈狀引據地院初審時張伯康之口供所稱，「購料比較表，處長常不批准後由本課課員朱必聞，張開源吿訴我可與處長太太疏通連絡，後來我去處長太太處，才知道太太要錢。那時課中已收到佣金二百八十萬，我就將一百萬元送給都香巖」。王律師根據以上口供替郁辦護兩點：（一）「教唆對於職務上之行爲要求賄賂」。教唆犯之成立，要本人無犯罪意思，經教唆者之主使始生決心之謂。郁香巖即使收受張伯康所送之一百萬元，亦爲在張伯康收受佣金之後，當非教唆。至多不過是否知情，及收受贓物問題，並非教唆對於職務上之行爲要求賄賂之問題。（一）丁澍惠之供詞與張伯康相符，覆判法院認郁與丁供詞無異議，其實在法院初審時，並未談過分派佣金之議，所講均爲普通話。並稱，「法院對此等重要證據，漏未斟酌……」並聞除上述聲請再審理由外，郁香巖尙有新證據提呈云。</p>
<h3>汽車行解雇司機　勞資間發生爭執</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕順風汽車行爲營業淸淡，解倔司機廿二名。解僱金問題迭經折衝，勞方允减低至四十二萬。資方認爲服務期滿一年以上者，可發二月退職金，（恰爲四十二萬），但廿二名司機中有二人未滿一年，亦要求同樣發給，資方不允，勞方堅持，遂形成僵局。</p>

<h3>大火被難災戶　招待新聞記者　對不法消防員　希望查明嚴辦　房東勒令遷移　呼籲與論界予以製裁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路六六〇弄大火案，被難災戶代表王文英（王雲甫之女）·顏澤之·鄭載堅·金鄭雪卿等，昨日下午四時假大西洋菜社招待新聞界發表談話，除希望當局對於消防人員失職不法行爲查明嚴辦外，並因六六〇弄房東最近登報限令該弄住戶於十日內一律遷移，不顧災戶痛苦，呼籲輿論界予以制栽。至於關於此次大火眞相及消防人員不法行爲，各代表似仍未能放胆吐露，僅稱當俟地檢處及調查委員會偵查。王文英小姐雖比較爽直敢言，但當記者詢其消防人員敲詐金條是否事實時，渠答稱亦僅係聽說而已。茲將各人談話分誌於後：</p>
<p>如果是火燒光　應該留有痕跡</p>
<p>顏澤之報吿四點；（一）此次大火，消防人員顯未努力施救，否則不致全弄燒光，希望當局澈底查明。（二）消防人員趁火搶刦有重大嫌疑，因爲災戶財物不翼而飛是事實。當時軍警林立，閒人無法入內，如果是火燒光，則應有痕跡。希望對於趁火搶刦的消防人員不能寬容，應依法嚴辦。（三）六六〇弄房東別有用心，最近竟登報限令房客於十日內遷移，除已聘請律師與其交涉外，希望社會共同制裁。（四）這次大火可說是空前浩刦，許多災戶已流離失所無家可歸，依法應予賠償，衡情亦應救濟，現市府已組織調查委員會調查，是非當有水落石出的一天。現在各災戶已聯合起立推定王雲甫。金鄭雪卿及本人爲代表，請各位隨時指導。</p>
<h3>王小姐慷慨陳詞　誰用手槍來打我　子彈眞也不值得</h3>
<p>繼由王雲甫女兒王文英報吿，她說：「火災損失照例是應該賠償的，但現在政府太窮，事實上工商業也沒有錢來辦好，那裏能賠償我們的損失，所以根本上辦不到的，慢慢再說。至於這次大火中趁火打刧是事實有幾點可以證明。第一，皮管是消防人員的最重要工具，如何會壓在地下，顯然是他們幹別的事情去了。第二，消防人員的號衣如何會在別人家中發現，想來他們搶到了衣裳，號衣不要了。第三，那天是年初一，消防員大概戲票沒有定到，所以存心看看大火的好戲，這塲戲一直看了十三小時，而且還有吃有喝，乘此享樂一番。第四，火勢一度熄滅，後來又復燃起來，這是什麼道理，還不是因爲敲詐不遂嗎？家父他們都怕事，怕生命財產全部毀滅，但是我不怕，我是一個女人，誰用手槍來打我，那他的子彈眞不値得了。我們家已燒掉，但道德心和人格不要也燒掉，應該把事實講出來，對於社會對於國家都有用處。上海好比一個黑暗複雜的大家庭，我是小妹妹，各位都是家屬，我們應該把這個家治好。</p>
<h3>龍頭未裝水先放　試部何人領導</h3>
<p>二十七號住哀悼鄭載堅提出三點質問：（一）銅匠作火場將熄滅時，何以不將水管移注二十九號王雲甫家以减低熱度？（二）二十九號焚燒時，何以不將二十五號等鄰居之屋頂鐵皮拆卸，俾可避免延燒。（三）當時消防員濯水時，龍頭尙夫裝好，而水已先放，致皮帶無法接上，試問領導者何人？消防處長有無到塲指揮？</p>
<p>最後王文英小姐又起立補充，並由各記者發問。她說第二天回家探視火場附近竟無軍警警戒，並聽到一消防負說：「早班的寫意，我們觸霉頭。」她家中至少有六十多隻箱子，但發掘火塲結果毫無痕跡。她自已有「私房錢」大條子三條及小條十金鎖片等，大條子放在鐵箱下層，已不翼而飛，金鎖片等則尙在，至於家中損失總値曾聽其父王雲甫親口說過，人家不相信猪鬃價値二十億元，實在一生積蓄三倍於此數云。</p>

<h3>抑平米價　在儘量拋售暹米之外　又照議價售白粳　市塲昨被監視正式交易稀少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕當局對抑平米價漲風，深具信心，昨共拋出西貢米一萬六千零八十包。計南市塲六千九百九十包。北市塲九千零九十包。每石價仍爲六萬三千元。昨日上午奧市長曾往中國銀行晋謁宋院長，請示關於抑平米價事宜。據悉政府除無限制拋售暹米外，今日起並將依議價大量拋售無錫白粳。吳市長表示一二星期內，米價即可抑平。</p>
<p>昨日市塲因有當局派員監視，白粳不得超出整魯價每石六萬九千元及零售價七萬六千元，還都嚴辦，故並無交易。塲外黑市略有做開，價目混亂。</p>
<p>吳市長昨告記者稱：昨傳白粳黑市已達十萬左右說，不確，根據市府派人至各區調查所得之報告，昨日白粳黑市最高價爲八萬八千元，現即將嚴懲此批超過議價之經售商稅。吳市長並表示今後洋米來源不用過慮。因依目前儲量而言，即可維持至八月底。渠希望市民多食中等米，因中等米營養旣豐，價又較廉云。</p>
<h3>麵粉價准予調整　食油兩週內不許變動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午，分別召集食油及麵粉業中人談話，結果決定食油新議價，在二週內維持不變。麵粉自今日起，實行新議價。</p>
<p>食油談話會，於下午四時十五分，在市府會議室舉行。到吉明齋，邱良榮，張德潤，李廷棟，謝裕祥，周蔚伯，張超等。榨油業方面，要求當局平價配售黄豆。吳市長原則已答應，至實行細則，須待商准宋院長後決定。惟食油新議價，二週內不得藉故變動。</p>

<p>昨日米市到源寥寥，南北市共僅二百六七十石，市塲仍無成交，僅白元陰元略有做開，價格猛漲四五千元，社會局已決定配售白米，以應米號實銷，油市廠方照常供給，淸油菜油蔴油均無上落，生油則消化活潑，上漲二三千元，依然緊俏，桶生油加三五千元，小車蔴油又飛漲萬餘元，豆油仍缺，麵粉趨勢尙平，略加千元，麩皮再漲五六百元，豆餅原料，猛漲不已，繼續劇升二千元，黄豆來源寥稀，再跳五六千元，形成無貨應市之狀，菉豆跟漲二三千元，赤豆亦加四五千元，芝蔴苞米續漲四五千元，生仁明定暗疲，高貨相仿，中次帶軟，小麥牢立。</p>

<h3>茶市略見秀色</h3>
<p>昨日茶市：賣買談判依然不寂，且尤以綠茶中之抽珍，珍眉等花色較形熱烈，惟因執貨心思堅化，扳持之意，變本加厲，是以做開交易，未許樂觀。價格方面，則以貨品關係，亦鮮顯著升起，然比上週咸帶秀色。</p>

<h3>買風愈煽愈熾　金市再見新高價　美鈔亦被帶起四百元</h3>
<p>烚赤昨以央行供胃有限終吿盤高，晨開四〇九萬有售，曾自四〇六萬扳高至四一〇萬，央行略有供給，而被阻，入後在四〇七萬迄四〇九萬間徘徊殊久，央行以四〇八萬之價，配給一二〇〇條，入後仍乏榮辱，十一時後，始漸見穩，迨天四一〇萬之價，重吿穿出，買風忽起，央行適無供給，於是扶搖直上，午刻躍升至四二五萬高價，而後稍盤，午後隔日交割央行供源更少，津市猛烈報漲，一時買風大盛，銀樓於四時後竟吿停市，新高峯達四四五萬，結果蛟上週六猛漲三十四萬，飾金四四萬五，銀元稍漲，暗息在一角半至一角八間。</p>
<p>外幣並無特色，美鈔暗盤晨初七千五至七千七，午刻隨金市微升至七千九，午後金價猛跳不已，鈔價亦帶高至八千一高價，結果較上週六漲起四百元，港票被動帶高至一五〇〇元以外，結果亦漲起九十元，港滙仍在一四九〇元，印滙一八二〇元，英滙二三六〇〇元，成交仍祗港滙稍多對做，餘者有行無市。</p>

<h3>市塲一片買進聲　煤價繼續猛漲</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤各貨，市塲一片買進聲，賣戶喊價拾級而上，尤以塊煤趨勢更緊，白煤焦作塊，聞經濟部有接管訊，故自新正以來並無到貨，現市價已高喊九十五萬無貨，雜鴻基塊（即新鴻基塊）亦需九十萬元，淸鴻基塊（即老鴻基塊）喊一百萬元，尙缺，其他低檔白煤塊，如寳慶，奉節，老龍等有小額運來，做開價在七十六萬至八十萬元間，交易頗活。</p>
<h3>成本工繳無不增高　棉布亦調整議價　較前漲百分之十至十六</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來布價高漲，棉布價格審議委員會特於昨日下午假社會局召開臨時會議。出席機器染織業公會潘士浩，六區棉紡織公會嚴光弟，棉布公會董久峰，紡建公司吳叔方，陳家振，市參議會劉靖基，紡管會劉文騰等。由社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元任主席。因紡建棉紗配價業已漲起約百分之十六，其他工資等亦莫不較前爲高，故決定調整議價，自今日起實行：</p>
<p>（一）十二磅白細布廠盤價自十萬二千調整爲十一萬八千。批發價自十一萬四千調整爲十三萬二千。漲起百分之十六。</p>
<p>（二）十二磅白斜紋廠盤價自九萬八千調整爲十萬七千。批發價自十萬九千調整爲十一萬九千。漲起百分之十。</p>
<p>（三）九磅元色嗶嘰廠盤價自十二萬二千調整爲十三萬四千。批發價十三萬六千調整爲十五萬。漲起百分之十。</p>
<p>（四）十二磅元色細布廠盤價自十四萬調整爲十六萬二千。批發價自十五萬六千調整爲十八萬。漲起百分之十六。</p>
<p>審查會又因紡管會對棉紗之限價管制已經撤銷，紡建公司配紗亦隨市上落，故認爲控制物價，必須控制物資，欲求本市棉布價格之平定，似應由管理物資之機構，秉國家之經濟政策，作適當之處置。此點呈請市府轉請紡管會核辦。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因紡建公司售於布號不多，廠家開貨觀望，門莊店去化甚暢，客帮搜吸亦强，致行情步見上升，龍頭細布每疋猛漲五千元，AAA彩球漲九千五百元，五福喊高至十二萬五千元，深色士林布價亦隨之上升，惟羅漢圖士林現貨充斥，價反下挫，其餘各布堅挺。</p>

<p>昨日紗市始降終堅，晨初因業中人多頭獲利出籠，價較上週六做低五七萬，旋以金價報高，新買戶乘廉吸納，價乃冉冉回升，重磅雙馬始做三百〇三五萬，最後成交三百十萬，普通廿支紗尤爲挺秀，價較上週約好三兩萬，花價迭高，人心仍昂，前途殊有欣欣向榮之况。</p>

<h3>旁觀者清　生產滙價若不設法整頓　出口市塲恐將盡歸消滅</h3>
<p>美國商人哈維氏之觀察</p>
<p>〔聯合社二日本埠訊〕紐約馬錫公司遠東經理哈維，兼代表數家百貨公司，在滬兩月，遍叩各工廠之門，一無所獲。據稱中國金融當局若不在兩個月內，採取嚴峻辦法，則將失去機會，出口市塲爲其外滙之主要來源，恐將盡歸消滅。實際上中國已失去機曾，其出口希望，除桐油等少數物品外，將等於零。戰前由中國大量供應之製成品市塲，巳盡被他國獲取。波多里哥·墨西哥·印度·瑞士及義大利，現均以中國式出品運銷美國，其索價僅及中國三分之一。窰貨在戰前本有大量輸出，今則加利福尼亞州已能自製。陶器亦由墨西哥輸入美國。葛布與地蓆，一向係由國供應，現由波多里哥輸出。印度亦在製造中國式地氈。至於花邊繡貨及蓆布等，在美銷路亦將由瑞士與義大利起而代之。恢復中國出口之主要障碳，爲工價與原料太貴，運輸缺乏及法定滙價之不合實際，美滙掛牌爲三千三百五十元，而黑市則在七千七百元左右。各種製成品在上海以美元計算，市價較戰前貴十倍，美國進口商雖願意接受較戰前貴兩三倍之價格，惟十倍以上則難望成交。且目前物價逐日上落太巨，營業更形困難。蔴布市價一週內漲起百分之四十，滙價殆未有變動，上海美商所遇困難，殊足駭人聽聞，包裝之費或且較貨價更貴。生產者不感興趣，亦使美商束手無策，許多買主因局勢何日好轉，殆屬遙遙無期，不願在此久候，故已束裝歸國，祗有少數仍堅留此間，希望當局者在兩個月內設法補救，藉以挽回局勢。目前情形受害者主要還是中國，美國公衆雖缺乏中國貨，不難求之其他市塲。美商雖仍注意中國商品，願意在此購買，但其價格必須合理，且有貨物供應方可云。</p>
<h3>馬口鐵狂漲　路皮鋁錫均俏利</h3>
<p>馬口鐵市價，繼續挺升，二六號大馬口鐵激漲二百五十萬元，每箱已達七百五十萬元，二四號鐵仍缺貨，聞喊價每張竟達九十萬，又小馬口鐵每箱亦跳五萬元，打包用六分路皮，春節後價亦突升，每噸已較去年年底價萵出一百五十萬元，各該貨品均因到貨稀缺，存底日見减少，存貨者以售出無法補進，是以開價頗昂</p>
<p>鉛錫市况，自紅盤開出後，仍現緊俏局面，喊價高昂，執貨者不願放手，致頗乏成交，其他銅類，雖市勢尙平，聞到貨仍極稀少。</p>

<h3>橫斷北美大陸五晝夜萬里行（三）</h3>
<p>— 毛樹清寄自舊金山</p>
<p>本報駐美特派員視野中的　舊金山的唐人街</p>
<p>宅活像一座大規模的博物館　是世界唐人街中最好的一處</p>
<p>一月十八日航訊</p>
<p>舊金山的唐人街，是世界任何唐人街中最好的一處。至少，在我足跡所及的歐美洲兩，我有這樣一個比較的結論。</p>
<p>加爾各答的唐人街最　，在英國統治印度的時代，常常把它當作一個傳染病的來源。加爾各答市政府，常常限制白種人夏天進入唐人街。美國軍隊駐屯在加爾各答的時候，軍部不准上兵在唐人街隨便飲食。夏天，很多唐人街的街頭巷尾，眞個是臭氣薰天。</p>
<p>以後，我奔走在歐洲，看見巴黎「里昂車站」附近的唐人街，也不够乾凈整齊，柏林的華僑集中區，雖比較整潔，但地區太小，根本就沒有唐人街的專稱。漢堡的唐人街，在斯摩克街，我的印象是：許多華僑的家庭，都住在「地窖」裏。（較馬路爲低的地下層）。莫國東倫敦的唐人街，是華藉海員的大本營，也顯得零亂和散漫。</p>
<p>到美國以後，我看過紐約和芝加哥的唐人街，紐約的不僅講，而且到處嗅得到「鹹魚臭」，不平整的唐人街馬路上，整日價　著載重卡車的聲音。會做生意的紐約導遊社，把紐約唐人街，作成各種口頭上的美麗的「廣吿」，其實，這樣，倒眞會使遊人「失望」。至於他們一批一批看了紐約唐人街以後，連帶對中國人民起什麼反應，那又是另一個問題了。</p>
<p>芝加哥的唐人街，我只到了兩次，我非常欣賞梅友卓先生他們發起建築的那座宮殿式大樓：安良工商會。堂皇，雅　，很可以代表一部份的中國文化。但是，當我這次一踏進舊金山，我才發現了：唐人街之大成。</p>
<p>第一印象　活像博物館</p>
<p>我對舊金山唐人街的第一個印象，是：活像一座大規模的中國博物館。整個一條格蘭第愛文義路上，除了兩頭一小段不算在唐人街區域以外，中間一長條，全是『中國本位』的舖面。中英文並列的大幅金字招牌，晚上五光奪目的霓虹燈，給遊人一種新鮮的感覺。唐人街上，最多是中國古董店，他們的英文譯名是ArtStore。古董店裏有中國歷朝的文物用器。一位久住在唐人街，對古董比較內行的曾老頭子吿訴我：中國漢唐朝代的珍品，在唐人街很多，但是，商周時代的東西，就很難得，很難得的了。</p>
<p>我因爲『外行』，分辯不出那些是贗品，那些是價値連城的國寳。我相信許多對東方古董有興趣的美國人：常常在橱窗門前徘徊讚賞着的老頭子和老太婆，他們也祗是看了「好奇」而已。聰明的古董商人，把觀世音的佛像，滿淸時代婦女的繡花裙子，甚至於「照相術」傳到中國以前，用作祭祀的祖宗畫像，都陳列在玻璃櫃內，給那些風俗習慣完全不相同的西洋人，一點一滴來欣賞讀嘆。</p>
<p>中國餐館　烹調佳價公道</p>
<p>除了數十家古董店以外，最普遍的要算是中國餐館。最大約有「遠東樓」，「大三元」，「上海模」，等等。舊金山的中國餐館，不僅烹調好，面且價錢比其他各地都公道。他們的烹調，都半是粵式，但粤式之中，又加了一點江浙的「糖醋」味。據老金山的朋友吿訴我：戰爭結束前，因爲社會動亂，餐館的生意好到極點，這一年來，已經差多了。</p>
<p>據我的粗枝大葉的觀察，金山的中國餐館，確沒有像紐約那般營業好·紐約人口多，中國學生也多，許多哥侖比亞學生，一天兩餐，都在中國餐館中用膳。舊金山雖也有中國學生，但都住在對河：柏格萊。這邊的住家的「唐人」，爲了經濟，大部份都家庭起伙。再加上餐館數量一多，營業額便相當分散，『滿座』的機會很少。因此，許多唐人街的餐館，相當注意於西洋顧客，他們在『雜砰』和「炒麵』兩項中　的錢，比鼎鼎調和的中國菜要多。</p>
<h3>進出口貿易公司　對象都集中在香港</h3>
<p>舊金山有六十多家進出口貿易公司，大半都在唐人街或唐人街附近。舊金山華僑領袖鄭炳舜先生的「裕安公司」，是最有權威的一家·據鄒氏說：戰前在三藩市經營出入口貿易的，僅二十多家，現在比從前增加了不少。在目前六十多家之中，大部份都由廣東籍的人士經營，因此，出入口的對象，不期而然都集中在香港。華僑匯款的情彩，也是如此。鄭先生非常誠懇的說：「這問題是相當値得注意的，香港主權的畸形存在，對中國的經濟建設，有着莫大的影響！</p>
<p>鄒炳舜先生約我唱「午茶」那天，恰巧梅友卓先生也從芝加哥來到金山。梅之來，是爲了商量籌組廣州市公共汽車公司的問題。據說：目前公共汽車的購置非常困難，如果公共汽車公司一旦開業，則廣州全市，至少需要三百輛，而美國汽車商人，決不願三百輛車同一天交付，這是一個生產脫節時代的事實上的困難。</p>
<p>那天，我們讀了許多美國華僑社會的經濟，敎育等等實際問題，同座的還有國民黨加拿大支部書記長陳立人，舊金山僑領尤永增，等等。我聽了許多具體事實，我覺得華僑社會，確實存在著不少隱憂：</p>
<p>華僑兩萬　「回唐」者二千人</p>
<p>華僑社會在美國，還不過百年的歷史。華僑第一脚踏上美洲新大陸，首先便接觸到舊金山。抗戰以前的幾十年之中，華僑靠勞工，靠勤儉的習性，筆路藍樓，開創他們的生計·這樣，一直到抗戰爆發。在抗戰的幾年間，乃至於中美並肩作戰的幾年間，是美國華僑的黄金時代。華工有了高工資的工作，華僑的餐館商店，都發了點小財。但是，戰爭的畸形　　一過去，情形又顯然變了。</p>
<p>許多華僑思念着　　，當然，祖國有他們的父母妻室和兒女。這一年多來，舊金山的兩萬多華僑之中，已經有二千多人『回唐』。全美國和加拿大，業已回國和準備回國的僑胞，總數約有二萬人。但是，從中國來的，年靑的一代，却得不到機會出來。移民律限制每年中國移民一百零五人，「就算每年都有一百零五人來吧，華僑社會的前途，依然不堪設想！」</p>
<p>華僑敎育困難　形成嚴重問題</p>
<p>華僑敎育也是一個百思不得解決的問題。目前，在舊金山唐人街，有兼辦中小學的華僑學校九所，由中華會館辦的，有中華中學校，國民黨黨部辦的，有建國中學；由地方會館主辦的，有陽和學校，有南僑學校，有孔敎學校，由敎會辦的，有聖公學校，聖瑪利學校，協和學校，金巴倫學校。以前還有浸信學校，於若千年前關閉。這些學校的共同困難，是敎學的時間問題，師資問題和敎科書問題。</p>
<p>凡是出生在美國領土以內的華僑子女，都是美國的公民·美國的法律，有强迫美國公民接受美國敎育的權利。因此，依照法律，華僑子女，應該接受美國的敎育。華僑學校敎授中文，祇佔着一個　　的地位，因此，上　的時間，多半在傍晚或晚上，學生拿疲勞的心　，來接受輔導敎育，當然效率不高，加之師資缺乏，敎員都是　　·缺乏優良而　度適合的敎科，，許多僑生子女，讀了若干年，依然　不得幾償方字。</p>
<p>僑生的一代　走向「美國化」</p>
<p>無論如何，年靑的僑生的一代，慢慢在從華僑社會遊離出去了。他們的環境和敎育，都使他們一天大在「美國化」。國民日報的劉伯驥兄說得很乾脆：「且英再期望他們回中國效力吧」！副領事吳強華兄，有一天談到唐人街的華僑婚姻槪况，他說：勤勞的年靑華僑，他們不願娶僑生的女孩子爲要，因爲這些女孩子，都學會了「美國化」，甚至學會了美國婦女的離婚！</p>
<p>許多人替以後的華僑幼苗担憂。他們說：這些小華僑們學會了美國人的油腔滑調，但沒有學會了美國人的勇敢，　　和進取心。</p>
<p>然而，也有人覺得並不悲觀。僑領之一的尤永增氏說：如果中國的文化團體，能够注意到這一問題，用外國傳敎士在中國辦學校的方法和精神，在這兒辦華僑敎育，依然可以收得效果。他認爲華僑敎育由政府管理，會惹起美國當局的不滿，非常不妥。</p>
<h3>中國飛機廠倒閉　反映華僑經濟命脈危急</h3>
<p>當今隱伏在唐人街的急務，恐怕還不是敎育問題，而是經濟問題，美國華僑社會，本來就沒有像南洋那樣的大資本家。雖然，美國華僑的一般物質生活，比其他地方爲優裕。但他們的經濟命脈，還是被動地依靠在美國的經濟機構上的。戰爭這幾年間，整個美國經濟畸形繁榮，華僑社會也沾受一點小利。但是，戰爭過去了，許多華工，失掉了豐酬的職業。鄭炳舜領導的華僑集股的「中國飛機廠」，一九四四年開辦，替美國軍部製造機身，最近正在辦理結束。原來有五百名工人，四分之三都是華工，現在都分別遣散。我聽廠內的負責人講過。他們原先期望中國政府來帮助或收置的，但是中國政府沒有那麽多的資金。後來，又一度改製無綫電收音機，又因爲競學本多，不容勿牟利，最後，終於決定了關門之一途。</p>
<p>飛機廠僅不過是華僑經濟狀况的一例。</p>
<p>「僑胞是可愛的」！三年來，我奔走在歐美的每一條唐人街的角落，我總有同一的感想。我到金山的第二天，張紫常總領事對我講許多僑胞踴躍捐輸的故事。接着，他又說：「十多年前，當我初作外交官的時候，看見唐人街，就討厭。但是，現在，我　了，我變成唐人街的忠實愛好者，我愛唐人街的一切」！（於舊金山華盛頓旅館）</p>
<h3>擬請改訂　陰曆元旦爲農民節</h3>
<p>— 董時進</p>
<p>査現行之農民節，係根據民國三十年三月間舉行之全國農林行政會議之建議，原規定爲二月五日，嗣後又改爲立春日，雖已推行數年，終不能使一般農民感覺興趣。竊以爲農民節欲使一般農民樂於遵行，必須適合鄕間習慣，並投合農民心理，因此主張利用舊有節日，改其名稱，不必叧行規定，而各種舊有節日之中，實以陰歷元旦最爲恰當，其理由如左：</p>
<p>（一）適合民間習俗　舊歷過年習慣，在民間迄今仍普遍遵行，無法破除，亦不必破除，若就此改爲農節，毋待政府推行，自然相習成風，隆重慶祝。惟日期如此規定，或不免有人嫌其在日曆上不能一定者，實則此層毫無妨害。現行之農民節原已無一定日期，在歐美各國亦不乏類似之先例。復活節係在春分以後月圓後之第一個星期日，美國之感謝節係在十一月之最後一個星期四，其日期皆年年不同。</p>
<p>（二）包涵深刻意義　舊曆過年習慣，不但並無妨害，而且實具感謝大自然及先人之美意，與歐美之聖誕節及感謝精神上並無一致。故過年之第一要事，爲供奉及拜謝天地與祖宗，虔誠莊敬，超出其他節日之上。其次則爲農產收穫以後，春耕開始以前之一度休息與娛樂，亦爲終歲辛動之農人所不可少。</p>
<p>（三）表示與民同樂　一般人民每感覺政府措施常不能顧及民間之習慣，即以過年一事而論，近年雖不嚴厲取締，然而機關須照常辦公，學校不准放假，不僅顯示政府與人民脫節，而且釀成敷衍虛僞之弊。實際上公旣未好好辦，課亦朱好好上，而同時亦不克儘興享樂，可謂一舉數失。惟陰曆旣廢，過年之名目自不必沿用，然若將此日定爲晨民節，則全國機關及人民皆可一致慶祝，共同享樂矣。</p>
<p>（四）保存民族習慣　任何民族皆有其特殊之風俗習慣，此風俗習慣乃其民族麗史文化之一部分，必須保存，並發揚光大者。乃近若十年以來，吾國一部分人士，於學歐倣美之際，往往不惜將同有之歷史文化，及無害之風俗習慣，亦一同拋棄。此不但自毀民族之特徵，亦屬全世界文化上之損失。今若定陰曆元旦爲農民節，則與曆法旣不相抵觸，而吾民族相沿最古遵奉最普遍之風俗，亦可保存矣。</p>
<p>（五）表示崇尚農業　吾人談崇尙農業，決不含輕視工業之意。今日國人似已一致同意，中國工業之發展，必須以農業爲基礎，故重視農業不啻即係重視工業之基礎。無論如何，中國現時仍是農業國，農業是中國最重要的產業，農人是中國最大部份的國民，也是最刻苦的生產份子。此種情形，決非短時間內所能根本改變。今若以民族歷史上最隆重之節日定爲農民節，當可以表示國家崇尙農業酬報農人之深意。</p>
<p>吾人提出此日期，並非在過年以外再加上一個節日，乃即就此定一名稱。至於慶祝此節日之方法，可悉沿用各種舊習慣，以莊敬肅穆酹酬交歡爲主，而不在乎舉行其他儀式及集會。但此時一般人民多閒暇，在正節日之後，各種遊藝　樂及展覽等，固皆可附帶舉辦也。</p>

<h3>家庭經濟我兒</h3>
<p>— 陳幼敬</p>
<p>每對夫婦們的心中，終希望着美滿家庭的生活，和怎樣使家庭幸福的增加。但是，阻礙家庭幸福，唯一的主要原因，就是經濟問題。由於經濟上的缺點，足使夫婦感情的破裂　甚致造成「離婚」的痛苦！所以筆者，特提出幾點意見：</p>
<p>（一）支配：就是說：要具有下列三個條件：一·量入爲出，二·收支平衡，三，適當理財。所謂量入爲出，就是夫婦應該根據自己經濟收入，來支配日常家用。所謂收支平衡，就是要正確預算，使收支適合。所謂適當理財，就是一方面須要顧到最低生活的限度，一方又要注意籌劃意外的費用。倘若支配適當，決不致入不敷出，有欠債的可能，亦決不致有臨渴掘井的憂愁。丈夫收入少，可以穩渡難關，否則雖收入多，反而會捉襟見肘。就是因爲合理和不合理的綠故。</p>
<p>（二）開源：夫婦倆，倘若無殘廢的情形，和沒有相當生產的能力，最好不要「坐吃山空」，宜謀一適常職業，及從事家庭副業。一方可以貼補家用，一方可以促進財富，經濟寬裕，夫婦情感自然增加了。</p>
<p>（三）合作：　首先要注意到，夫婦間決不可有自私的心，雙方要明瞭對方經濟的狀况，以免加重經濟上的負担。切實坦白的合作，解除經濟方面的困難。夫婦對於經濟，負有一種義務，不能一方盡情享樂任意揮霍，一方則含辛茹苦錙鈢必較，造成苦樂的不，反不能補償經濟上的漏巵積。倘若收人有餘的時候，應該均蓄起來，以備不時的用處。如逢失業，亦可减輕負担，不用担憂。若要做到有飯大家吃有錢大家用的地步，經濟公開，自有辦法</p>
<p>（四）節約：動勞則不致餓死，節儉則不生貪慾。家庭中最主要的，就是節約。怎樣能節約呢？一·在不妨碍工作範圍內，最好自己操作，不要僱用僕役，一面可以節省金錢，不受閑氣，和從中揩油的害處；一面可以增加烹飪和縫紉的經騐，不要倚賴他人。二·力加屛除無謂的應酬，不正當的娛樂，和不良的嗜好，因爲這幾種，均能使經濟竭　，甚致爲了經濟恐慌，造成犯罪的結果。三·婚喪喜慶的重大事故，應斟酌自己經濟能力，在節約原則下，盡力節省，不要硬要面子。</p>
<p>（五）正確：夫婦的愛，決不要含有虛榮的心，甘受金錢的引誘，要有同甘共苦的精神。因爲一有了虛榮，就要造成奢侈的生活，浪費金錢，在對方賺錢的時候，不加愛惜，一旦收入毫無，又不免歧視，致發生夫婦間意見的不和，變成了柴米夫妻的姻緣。要認識淸楚，血汗的金錢是不容易隊的，愛惜金錢，就是愛護對方。</p>
<p>我們要知道：合理的家庭經濟，可以維持家庭的快樂。可以促成夫婦生活的美滿，所以夫婦們都應該澈底注意，這個重要的家庭問題！（却酬）</p>
<h3>新家庭的全料玉律</h3>
<p>— 安娜</p>
<p>不論你所住的地方是大是小，終得有一個你自己的家庭。</p>
<p>切勿在吃飯前，支哩咕嚕，說一些使人聽了厭耳的話，飯後也切忌。</p>
<p>時常避免滔滔不絕的爭吵，刺刺不休的辯論，其實所爲的事，都是不値得大張旗鼓的。</p>
<p>時常互相妥協，這是離婚的最好「抗毒素」。</p>
<p>眞實同情，與彼此諒解。</p>
<p>尊重對方的長輩和親友。</p>
<p>要把你的家庭建設，視如宗敎的信仰上帝。常常要以寬恕的精神來對待你的對方，你將會感到美滿家庭幸福的。</p>
<p>以上各條請問你奉行了嗎？</p>
<h3>如何糾正口吃</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>尋常一個三四歲的孩子，他們的說話機構大多還未能操縱裕如。有幾個字是他們難於吐述的，有幾個音他們常不能發得正確。有時候這些字就使他們期期艾艾鬧口吃病。</p>
<p>倘若發生了這種情形，切勿立即以正確的音或　連續地訓練他。向他說一遍就够了。不要對着這樣一個三四歲的小孩子，便想敎他語音學。不必以任何說話方式訓練他。你應該將注意力集中於完易引起口吃病的字音上。這種口吃病常易與一種嚴重的說話缺陷相混淆，以致造成了若干原可避免的麻煩。</p>
<p>孩子們在開始講連續性語句之時，原是容易犯口吃的。當這種情形發生時，留心你的眼睛，不要注視孩子的臉，表示你正忙着旁的事情，雖則暗地裏正在留心聽着他。</p>
<p>口吃是因爲孩子嘴裏說話的部分用了過多的力，因此鯁止了，假使他能有時間調整，他會重說一遍，比前說得慢而說出了所想說的事情。你若呌他停下，糾正那個字的發言，是沒有用的。他正在想表達腦中的一個思想，當那思想因你糾正他發音而被阻止的時候，舌部阻力加重，只有更使口吃嚴重而已。</p>
<p>假若孩子在某一個字上鯁止說不下去了，和悅平靜地看着他，然後說，「我看你今天早晨很够忙的了，現在去喝杯水吧，我在這裏等着聽你。」</p>
<p>你轉移他的注意力，給他充分時間恢復情緒。你給他一種平靜信賴的氛圍，他將感到輕易。造成口吃病的緊張情緒於是會慢慢鬆馳，他說起來便好得多了。有眞正的說話缺陷病的孩子是很少的。假使發現有此種缺陷時，便應立則請專家診治。</p>
<p>向小孩說話，要說得淸楚而慢。不要應用嬰兒的語言。不要對刁嘴用笑容加以讚許。刁嘴並不是件好笑的事，兒時不加糾正，長大便難得改了。在此時你應將這一個字淸晰地說一遍。然而也不必連續訓練他。孩子們是摹仿家庭裏的語言的，只要那是好的語言，他們的話自然隨着變好。給他們充分的時間學習。</p>
<h3>鬆糕</h3>
<p>— 貴石</p>
<p>新年食品之一</p>
<p>鬆糕，他的形狀大小方圓不一，但說到他的來歷，却有着和名喚定勝糕的相同的做法；他的質地是鬆鬆的，軟軟的，沒有年糕那般硬性，又因爲一蒸便熟，故而一直就爲精明的主婦所使用着。現在我們且捲起了袖，來試騐一下吧。</p>
<p>原料—米粉三份。赤豆一份（熟而不裂）。糯米粉二份。白糖二份。</p>
<p>以上四物皆爲製糕之基本物，而其份數則隨所需可酌量增减之。他若猪油，墨　，胡桃肉，荳沙，玫瑰花（茶葉店有售）等等皆隨自己之喜歡而添加。</p>
<p>器物—大約八寸之小蒸籠連蓋一套，以及盛粉之器皿。</p>
<p>步驟—取米粉三份，和以糯米粉二份共同拌和均勻加人容器內，加以溶人白糖二份之沸水，而調散搓之成粗鹽狀之細粒，再加以煮熟之赤豆一份（去湯），而拌勻之，然後分佈在微熱的蒸籠墊布上，其原薄則以不超過一英吋左右爲最佳，上面加上猪油，黑棗，玫瑰花等物，以成美觀之圖案，諸事備就，將蒸籠放在普通之鐵鍋內以水蒸之，約十分鐘左右，面上所放猪油已開始溶化，這就是提示你，那糕已煮熟了。若是你喜製夾沙的呢，那也是一樣，就在放粉時，祗及其半，待蒸熟後，在上面均勻的散佈一層豆沙，而後再加以粉料，則在切開時，就成豆沙夾層哩。</p>

<p>— 契珂夫著　李孟飛譯</p>
<p>（多少孩子在聖誕節裏歡樂地獲得　的的禮物；多少孩子在聖誕節裏眼巴巴地望着凄凉的空虛。）</p>
<p>九歲的凡卡茲休考天，已經在阿賴克罕皮鞋匠那裏當了三個月的學徒。在聖誕節前夕，他並沒有上床去睡覺，他直等老闆夫妻倆和老師父們出去做彌撒的時候，才從老　的碗極裏取得了一小瓶墨水，和一枝筆尖鐵銹了的鋼筆桿；然後在他面前鋪開了一張摺　的信紙，他開始寫了。</p>
<p>在前，不管怎樣，他決定寫第一封信，他偸偸地他望着門窗，對着黯澹的聖像看了幾眼。聖像的兩邊的木架上，掛滿了鞋楦。他深深地一聲凄然的嘆息。信紙展開在長凳上，他自己也就蹲跪在長凳的面前。</p>
<p>「親愛的老爹康斯坦丁，馬加歷契」，他寫道。「我寫一封信給你。我敬祝你聖誕節快樂和上帝保佑你。我沒有爸爸和媽媽，你才是我所有的」。</p>
<p>凡卡尙窗上瞧了瞧，窗上正反射着他的燭光，栩栩地影出了他的祖父，康斯組丁，馬加歷契，他是茲希弗立夫先生家裏的看夜人。一個矮小，瘦弱，而精神却特別健旺的六十五歲的老頭。一雙爛紅眼，永遠是那麼笑咪咪地。他整天躺在佣人們的廚房裹，老是和廚子鬧着玩。晚上，裏着一件寬大的羊皮襖，提着一根木棒，一步一記地在他看守的地點　踱着，身後，跟隨着兩條低垂了頭的狗，一條雌叫卡許坦加，叫維恩的是一條雄的。那麼雌狗幹嗎這樣的呼叫牠，因爲牠黑色的皮毛，瘦長的身體，而又賽似一條泥鱔。維恩是一條罕有的馴良的雄狗，牠和善地望着陌生客和望着主人一樣，可是人家並不相信牠這麽溫順，在牠順從和卑賤之下，懷藏着更多可查究的惡意。沒有一個能比牠更熟悉如何去竊取或偸吃一塊腿肉，如何溜進伙食房去偷取農夫的小鷄。不止一次，牠的後腿差一點被打斷。又被懸吊了二次，每星期牠總是被鞭撻得幾乎死去，可是牠還是復活着。</p>
<p>凡卡的老爹，每逢某一個時候，準是站立在門邊，向着那村裏敎堂的光亮紅色的窗戶眨着眼，他的脚在高統的皮靴裏頓踏着，在庭園裏戲弄着人們。他的木棒吊掛在腰帶上，爲了冷，他縮緊了自己的身體，間斷地嗆着老年人的乾咳嗽。時時向婢女或廚子瞎纏。</p>
<p>「你們可要于點鼻烟嗎」？」他問道：一面取出他的鼻烟盒給女人們，女人們也就黏了一些在鼻子裏，馬上就打起噴嚏來了</p>
<p>老頭兒就如發狂般地高聲大笑大叫：</p>
<p>「噴嚏打出來呀，否則它會把你的鼻子都凍結了呢」！</p>
<p>他也把鼻烟給狗黏上一點，卡許坦加打着噴嚏，急急地扯牽牠的鼻子，光火地跑開了。維恩謙恭地拒絕了這個玩意兒，只是搖動牠的尾巴。這眞是個好氣候，一絲風也沒有，只是淸澈　結霜的黑夜，整個村莊的白色的屋頂上，一陣陣烟霧從烟囟裏冒出來，樹木被嚴霜　飾着白銀，倒處是厚厚的雪堆，你能看望到白茫茫的一切。天上明晶的星星，燦然地閃爍着，天河澄淸地横亙在一邊，似乎是專爲這佳節，用白雪堆琢得非當的光滑。</p>
<p>凡卡嘆息了一聲。筆尖向墨水瓶裏蘸去，繼續地寫下去：</p>
<p>一昨晚我受到一頓毒打，老闆一把頭髮把我拖到庭園裏，用敲皮鞋的踏蹬狠命地打我，因爲當我搖擺他小鬼的搖籃的時候，不幸我竟睡着了。在這一星期中，老闆娘吩咐我洗滌一條靑魚，而我先從尾巴刮起，所以她拿起靑魚，把它的鼻尖刺戳着我的面孔。老師父們還嘲弄我，帶我到酒肆裏去飲伏特卡（酒名），還使我去偸取老闆的胡瓜。老闆就不顧死活地把我亂揍。沒有好吃的東西；早餐是麵包，中飯是稀粥，晚上又是麵包。紅茶和酸菜湯祗有老闆夫妻兩能狂飲大喝。他們令我睡在門廊內，然而當他們的死小鬼哭叫的時候，我根本就不能睡，因爲非得去搖搖籃不可，娥愛的老爹呀，看上帝的面吧，把我帶到我們鄕村的家裏去，我再也受不了呢……我向你　拜，我會永遠永遠地祈禱上帝。領我去吧，不然我將會死掉…」</p>
<p>凡卡的嘴角撇了下來，用他骯髒的拳頭揩拭着眼睛；咽鳴了起來。</p>
<p>「我會送你烟草的」，他繼績寫下去，「我爲你祈禱上帝，要是我有甚麽錯處，那你鞭　我如那灰色的山羊一樣好了。假使你眞想我找不到工作，我會去問經理的。霍上帝的面，讓我來擦揩皮靴，或者我來替代斐得霞做牧童。親愛的老爹」我再也忍受不了，它會虐殺了我…我要私逃到我們的鄕村裏來，可是我沒有靴子，我怕這嚴寒的重霜。當我長大起來的時候，我會照顧你的，誰也不想傷害你。當你逝世的時候，我會祈禱你靈魂的安息。就像祈禱披拉甘霞媽媽一樣。</p>
<p>「關於莫斯科，這是一個碩大的城市，那還有許多富人們的房屋，許多馬，可沒有羊，狗倒也不見得狠兇惡。兒童們在聖誕節都不佩戴星章，誰也不許在唱詩班裏歌唱。有一次，我看見一家店舖的橱窗裏，掛着釣魚的竹竿，鈎子和繩索，廉價出賣，那釣鈎無論捕捉那一種魚，都是非常便利的。還有另外一條魚鈎，它能釣起一條一磅重的大鯰魚。還有出著槍的舖子，有着像老闆所用的那枝槍一樣的。我斷定一管槍總得化一百個盧布。肉莊上有山鶉，鷓鴣和野兎，可是誰去把它打來，或是它們從那裏飛跑來，店裏的人却不願說的。</p>
<p>「親愛的老爹，在主人們的聖誕樹上，替我摘一顆金色的胡桃，藏匿在我綠色的盒子內。向主婦奥爾甘，依格娜伊芙娜說一聲，說是這胡桃是凡卡所討取的。」</p>
<p>凡卡　攣地嘆息着，又向窗凝視了一下。他記得他的老爹慣常跑到森林裏去伐一棵聖誕樹，還帶着他的孫子，多麽快樂的時候啊！嚴霜在老爹的脚下坼裂地響着，凡卡也照樣地踏着，在砍劈聖誕樹之前。老爹吸着旱烟管，黏一下鼻烟，又和可憐凍疆的小凡卡取笑…那些小樅樹被嚴霜　裏　，呆呆地佇立着，不知那一棵是在等死。突然，一隻野兎不知從那裏跳過來，一下就蹤到霜堆裏去…他的老爹禁不住的大叫了起來：</p>
<p>「捉牢他，捉牢牠，捉牢牠！啊，短尾的鬼東西！」</p>
<p>常聖誕樹砍倒之後，他的老爹把它拖曳到主人的家裏，他們就開始替它裝飾。主婦奧爾甘，凡卡最光榮的朋友，爲它忙碌不堪。</p>
<p>當時凡卡的媽媽，披拉霞娘姨還活着的時候，奧爾甘主婦總塞給他幾段甘蔗，空閒的時候，她敎他念書，寫字，從一數到百，甚至還來玩四組跳舞的遊戲。當披拉甘霞死去的時候，他們把孤兒凡卡遣到廚房去和他的祖父一起，再從廚房裏把他送到莫斯科皮鞋匠阿賴克罕那裏。</p>
<p>「快來吧，親愛的老爹啊」，凡卡繼續寫着，「我懇求你，看上帝的面，把我從這裏帶走。可憐可憐一個瘦弱的孤兒吧。在這裏，他們毒打我，又是餓得要命，我不能吿訴你我是多麽悲傷，我老是叫喊着。有一天，老闆用鞋楦亂敲我的頭，我就倒了下去，把我揍得死去活來，我的生活是太慘了，灶不上一隻狗喲………我向亞麗奧娜和一隻眼狄羔以及那個馬伕問候，可不許讓那一個拿去我的口琴。你的孫兒依凡，茲休考夫，親愛的老爹，準得來的呢」。</p>
<p>凡卡把信紙摺成四疊，插進在晚飯前化一個銅板買的信封裏。他想了想，把鋼筆蘸向黑水瓶去，隨即寫下了地址：</p>
<p>「鄉村，我的老爹」。於是他抓抓頭，又想了想，再添加了上去：「康斯坦丁，馬加歷契」。他很高興，因爲沒有人來干涉他的寫信，他帶上了帽子，忘了披上羊皮大襖，外衣也沒穿地向街上跑由。</p>
<p>他在晚飯前曾詢問了賣家禽的夥計，他才知道信得投入郵箱裘，從這裏，他們會把信件遞送所有的地點。由　熏熏的郵差則搖着鈴駕駛着馬車挨戶送到。凡卡奔跑到第一個郵箱，把他尊貴的信從口縫裏滑了進去。</p>
<p>一個鐘點以後，他被希望撫慰着睡了，眠得挺熟。在他的夢中，他看見了火爐，在火爐旁，坐着他的老爹，並擺着他赤裸的脚，正對着廚子唸着信，維恩搖着尾巴徘徊在火爐的四週。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　158</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>一這倘「八」的吉利解釋，也是我們中國的產物；奸像根據那句俗語『如要發，不　八。』除此以外，也推想不出其他高妙的學說來。如今萍子旣然囑咐你注意「八」的秘密；說老實話，這是要用日本腦筋去推想的。好在你現在已有幾種解釋，不妨說出來，大家參詳一下。」鶴見繼續他的解釋。</p>
<p>「我認爲我推想的這幾種，還不充分，剛才不久，不是通電給「〇十二」嗎？其中也有這麽一條。也許他可以給我們一個比較滿意的答覆。至於我所推想的第一種，恐怕萍子口　的「八」，是指着參謀本部所擬，那個「大東亞程序推進，八大先頭秘密站！」</p>
<p>「這是什麽時候宣佈的？」我問。</p>
<p>「還沒有宣佈，我只見到末次草案，也是一位同去從部裏弄出來的。」</p>
<p>「所謂大東亞程序……？」我沒有聽見過這個名詞。</p>
<p>「這是第五縱踪的新貢獻，其實也是伊藤博文以來的老調；無非什麽「要征服世界，必光祉服東亞」等等。現在雖已發動大陸戰事，在近衛和少壯派眼光裏，這個舉動，僅僅是個序幕。據他們想，佔領中國，簡直不或問題。最要緊的，乃是對付英美蘇法的對策。對策的主要方式，是先設立八個先頭秘密站！」</p>
<p>「八個？」我有些懷　疑八個似乎太少。</p>
<p>「是的」，鶴見又換上了一枝烟捲，「正是八個秘密兵站。」</p>
<p>「大約不外乎香港，海防，新嘉坡………」</p>
<p>「不必亂猜，你這思想，不合日本邏輯，讓我說給你聽罷——先說對付蘇聯方面的；蘇聯横貫歐亞的鐵道，離日本最近的一個據點，乃是赤塔……」</p>
<p>「什麽？」我認爲鶴見說錯了。</p>
<p>「赤塔」鶴見又重覆了一句。</p>
<p>「不對……」我很有把握的反對，「你不是說蘇聯鐵道距離日本的最近據點麼？」</p>
<p>「不錯」</p>
<p>「怎麽是赤塔？連小學生都知道蘇聯横貫歐亞鐵道終點，乃是海參崴；也距日本最近。」</p>
<p>「哈哈，哈哈！」鶴見狂笑了起來。</p>
<p>「怎麽說？」我有些不服。</p>
<p>「老大哥，」鶴見多舊笑着，「您太小看日本了！至少，您還沒有知道日本軍部狂到了什麽程度咧！」</p>
<p>「噢！」這一點我很承認。</p>
<p>「自從九一八之後，日本的國防部，以東京爲中心，對大陸各部，早已蓋上了一個二千五百公里的大圈，國防的外沿，早已伸到蒙古以及中國東　沿海各區。現在這個大圈，據他們看，己經變成二層內圈了。您老大哥還在做夢哩！」</p>
<p>「哦！」我承認確乎是在做夢。</p>

<h3>不盡戲法滾滾來　鈔票變成大理石</h3>
<p>— 高武弘</p>
<p>勝利後，我們常常看到許多「高明的「戲法」，令人拍案驚奇，撫掌稱絕。看過的大家都已記在心裏，不必再提。現在再來提一件新鮮的事兒，「愈變愈奇」有「出神入化」之妙，正是：「不盡戲法滾滾來。」</p>
<p>「黄金獎鋼」和「黄金變　」的「花樣」，都已「領敎」過了，這裏要向各位介紹的一套「新奇魔術」，是：「鈔票變大理石」。據中央社香港三十一日電，香港報紙，於是日載稱：中央銀行前無在美定印五百元鈔票五百箱，印就後即運抵印度，保存一相當時期後，始運往上海。最近有三百箱自上海運香港轉廣州，三十日自香港運抵廣州時，發覺其中有現鈔三十箱約八千萬元，業已被竊。香港央行常局，於啓箱時就發現箱中現鈔「不翼而飛」，（大概是乘了飛機之故。）而代以印度所製的大理石，十箱中的一箱內，大理石之外。還發現女用短大衣一件。香港央行代表稱：「現鈔究於上海，香港，抑或於廣州被竊，尙不能霄定；但相信失竊事係發生於印度。」他的「邏輯」是：「箱內旣係印度製大理石，「當然」是在印度被竊。」</p>
<p>看樣子，這件「奇案」，又將不了了之。即使追究，而「發覺」已遲，失竊的地點，又難以「査考」，也追究不出什麼下落來。</p>
<p>八千萬元，數目「尙」小，但鈔票能變大理石，外加女用短大衣一件，這套「新奇奪目」的「魔術」，却是値得一提，讓大家賞光賞光，中國有這種「手段高明」的「魔術家」！</p>
<p>「黄金變銅」和「黄金變糞」的「西洋鏡」還沒有戮穿，現在緊接着又演了一套「鈔票變大理石」，「戲法何多」，中國人的「眼福」不淺。這類事情，如果一一都成了「懸案」，「變」的人「藝高人膽大」，膽子愈來愈壯，「花樣」也「愈變愈奇」，將來不知又會「變」出什麼「新花樣」來？</p>

<h3>捷克一小村莊飛來一筆橫財（下）</h3>
<p>— 家源譯自「國際文摘」</p>
<p>六百萬元美金普遍配給</p>
<p>生命朝不保夕黃金又有何用</p>
<p>所以這個　經風霜的軍官——他的名字在捷克斯拉夫政府的擋案中並無記載——就對他手下的軍曹說：「誰知道明天我活不活？誰知道我能否看到柏林？讓我們把這筆錢分給村中的居民吧」。</p>
<p>繼而，他又說：「軍曹，你去辦理這件事，設法使每一個男子，每一個女人，每一個小孩得到一份。問明每一個人的年齡，每一歲就給一千柯魯那（捷克幣名），我想總發得够吧」。</p>
<p>薩斯丁村居民頃刻變成巨富</p>
<p>在這個難題解決之後，他就躺在一張榻上，安然睡去了。</p>
<p>就在這個春光用媚的日子，薩斯丁村馴良的居民，突然變爲巨富，當日發出的款項，共計三億柯魯那（折合美金六百萬元）。</p>
<p>在最初幾小時內，薩斯丁村民直弄得目瞪口呆了，他們都不敢相信自己的奇遇，不敢斷定是眞是夢，大一點的家庭，竟有拿到一萬五千至二萬「柯魯那」的。每一個人都像發瘋似的跑到店舖中，盡情化用。</p>
<p>在一刹那間，薩斯丁變成了或許是歷史上通貨膨脹最快的塲所。本來修一次面祗要三個柯魯那，現在要三千，村中整個經濟陷於混亂中。每一個人都成了巨富，勞動者都拒不工作，工廠全部停頓，商人把全部存貨都賣光了，價格高得驚人。</p>
<p>頭寸太爛物價扶搖</p>
<p>當薩斯丁村中的商店把存貨都賣光之後，村民就趕到附近的城村中去；於是這些地方的物價也就扶搖直上了。捷克東北隅彷彿發生了一次金融上的地震，而薩斯丁就是震源所在地。</p>
<p>但是村民並不是愚笨地把全部新獲得的資產一起用光，許多人在驚喜一陣之後，就把用剩的錢藏起來，埋在園裏或地窖中。</p>
<p>五月中旬，勃拉　斯拉伐銀行負責人檢査銀庫中失却的鈔票，結果査悉：失鈔都流散在薩斯丁。但是銀行不能强迫民衆交還款項，於是捷吉政府就請他們自動交出，看他們的愛國心如何。</p>
<p>村民愛國獻金政府</p>
<p>於是一　令人不能相信的事情發生了：薩斯丁的村民開始發掘園地，掘出了一億一千五百萬柯魯那交還政府。其餘的一億八千五百萬柯魯那，大槪是散失於其他城村了。</p>
<p>今日，薩斯丁已經恢復以往的平寗，田園風光，宛如曩昔。但是一年半前飛來横財的這樁奇遇，村民還是永難忘懷的。</p>

<h3>National Army Advances on Multiple Routes Towards Linyi:</h3>
<h3>Su-Lu Battlefield Sees "Pushing Mill" Tactics,</h3>
<h3>Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's Forces Face Encirclement</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 3rd] The current Su-Lu war situation is developing into a highly interesting "pushing mill" tactic. According to General Luo, a respected military observer here: the Su-Lu war focuses on Xuzhou. The National Army considers the areas east and west of Xuzhou as two major operational theaters, while the Communist forces, led by Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, are based in southern and southwestern Shandong respectively. As of the evening of the 2nd, Zhang Lingfu's unit, formerly under Wang Yaowu, had recaptured Tancheng on the 1st and was advancing towards Linyi, the Communist stronghold in Shandong, only 30 li away. Another unit, led by Hao Pengju, had also crossed the Yi River and arrived at a designated location, awaiting orders to advance. The Communist forces in Linyi are clearly wavering. This concerns the southern Shandong front. As for the southwestern Shandong front, Liu Bocheng's Communist forces, including the 4th and 5th Columns, are harassing the periphery of Minquan and Dangshan, heading south. In this operational situation, the National Army is encircling from southeast to northeast of Xuzhou, while the Communist forces are encircling from northwest to southwest of Xuzhou, forming a highly interesting "pushing mill" tactic. Although the situation is tense, we consistently maintain a favorable position. Barring unforeseen events, our forces should be able to directly strike Linyi within three days. Conversely, Liu Bocheng's flanking attack on Xuzhou was anticipated and guarded against. This move by the Communist forces is merely a waste of manpower. At this point, General Luo smiled and said that if the Communist forces avoid a decisive battle and retreat into the mountains, it would reveal that their self-proclaimed Zaozhuang victory was nothing more than that. The National Army considers it only the opening act of the Xin'an Battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] After the National Army recaptured Tancheng, it formed a "horn-like" position with the garrison at Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway. The five regiments of Zhang Guangzhong's local Shandong military district, the guard brigade from Zaozhuang, Zhang Jianxin's 10th Division from Yi County, as well as Zhang Huating's New 7th Division and Zhang Zhen's 10th Column and Xie Xiangjun's 10th Column in Lincheng and Sihuzhen, are all within the National Army's encirclement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] After their defeat near Tancheng in southern Shandong, the Communist forces in Linyi are showing signs of wavering. Military transport by the Communist forces is extremely busy on the roads from Linyi to Yi County and Zhucheng. Large numbers of handcarts and wagons have been requisitioned from the populace in recent days to transport food and provisions from Linyi to the rear. Furthermore, to reinforce Linyi, the Communist forces urgently need over ten thousand troops. These are moving south from Mengyin and have already reached the vicinity of Qingtuo Temple, 35-8 li north of Linyi.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The National Army, advancing north beyond Tancheng in southern Shandong, reached Shatun, over 40 li north of Tancheng, this afternoon. The main force of the Communist forces on the banks of the Yi River is collapsing towards Linyi. Chen Yi clearly intends to avoid a decisive battle with the main forces, planning to flee to the Yi-Meng mountain area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The three columns of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces, roaming the border areas of Henan and Anhui, invaded Luyi, Haoxian, and elsewhere on the 3rd, encountering a counterattack from a certain unit of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 3rd] Recent dispatches from the front lines state that the well-equipped National Army is advancing towards the Communist stronghold of Linyi in southern Shandong along three routes: southeast, southwest, and due south. The city is expected to be recaptured soon. The southern route National Army, after capturing Dabu, 35 miles north of Tancheng, yesterday, is rapidly advancing north. Dabu is 30 miles north of Linyi and 15 miles from Lijiazhuang. After withdrawing from Tancheng, the Communist forces reorganized at Lijiazhuang. The southeast route National Army is rapidly advancing from Ganyu, which is only 38 miles from Linyi. The southwest route National Army is heading directly towards Linyi from Heierzhuang. To impede the National Army's offensive, Liu Bocheng's Communist forces are intensifying activities west of Xuzhou in the eastern part of Henan province. After capturing Zheshan, they have moved into the areas of Xiayi and Yongcheng. The National Army in southwestern Shandong still occupies Jining, Jinxiang, and Heze, but has withdrawn from Shanxian, Caoxian, and Dingtao.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Liu Songfeng, the magistrate of Tancheng County, led personnel into the city on the 3rd to resume official duties and expedite emergency relief efforts.</p>
<h3>No Changes in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway:</h3>
<h3>Communist Forces Concentrated in Four Towns Around Baoding,</h3>
<h3>Traffic Efficiency on the Pingjin Railway Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] There are few changes on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. Reports of the recapture of Dongchangshou are inaccurate. Prices in Shijiazhuang are skyrocketing, with a box of ten cigarettes costing 5,000 yuan. Communist forces are concentrated around Baoding.

The envoy expressed displeasure at external reports that his activities were related to the reorganization of the Chinese government. It is said that he is responsible for the duties of the U.S. Ambassador and cannot interfere in Chinese internal affairs. The reporter visited Zuo in the evening, asking for his views on the Youth Party's participation in the reorganized government and its relationship with the Communists. Zuo said that the Youth Party's participation in the reorganized government should not be based on the military progress or retreat of the Nationalists and Communists. The reason why a decision has not yet been made on the steps for participation is that it is "easy to say but difficult to do", so it is still under discussion before a decision can be made. The reporter asked whether the method of reorganizing the government would be comprehensive. Zuo said: Yes. At the same time, he said that the government has no objection to this. Finally, the reporter asked that if the Democratic League and the Chinese Communist Party are not able to participate, how will the veto issue be resolved? Zuo said: This is</p>

<h3>Shanghai Commercial Tycoon</h3>
<h3>Discusses Economic Situation</h3>
<p>Prices are Fighting Inflation</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, this reporter visited a prominent figure in the Shanghai business community to inquire about his views on the current situation. He said: Because the Chinese Communists firmly reject peace talks, the hope for domestic peace is very slim, which is very regrettable. If the internal strife is prolonged, China will lose its international standing obtained after eight years of hard fighting, and the good opportunity for reconstruction and development will disappear with it. For the sake of national construction and the interests of the nation, everything is hoped that the Chinese Communists will change their policies, strive for political goals through political methods, and abandon the current destructive policies. I am not a member of the Kuomintang, but from the standpoint of the people, I support Chairman Chiang's policy of national reconstruction and development, and the government's use of military force to restore transportation is also a necessary measure. Touching on the current economic situation, he said that inflation has entered a vicious circle stage, and the soaring prices after the New Year are mainly caused by this.</p>
<p>Government Controls Rice:</p>
<p>Can Adopt Rationing System</p>
<p>The government has now adopted a suppression policy. Leaving aside gold, the municipal government is making its best efforts regarding rice in Shanghai. I believe that in addition to finding ways to increase supply, a rationing system must be adopted. Since the municipal government has a large amount of rice in its control, it can distribute rice to households based on residence permits. Otherwise, the price of rice will rise daily, and poor people will suffer from being unable to buy rice. Britain has not abolished the rationing system since its victory to date, which can serve as a reference for our country. The source of coal is not lacking, and with proper handling, it should not be too difficult to resolve. In summary, the current price suppression policy is fighting against inflation, and the people must remain calm and not panic too much. Under today's circumstances, the restoration of the economy to normal is definitely not something that can be achieved in the short term.</p>
<p>The Media Should Use its Power to</p>
<p>Crack Down on Illegal Activities</p>
<p>At the same time, the responsibility of the media at this time is very heavy, because today society's emphasis on newspapers is not the same as before the war. Newspapers should use their great power to assist the government in controlling prices, crack down on illegal activities, and must not, in their reports, fuel the flames and create panic among the people.</p>
<h3>The China Changchun Railway Issue</h3>
<h3>Is Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] Regarding the China Changchun Railway issue, the former British Consulate in Shenyang issued a message stating that the China-Soviet negotiations have reached an agreement, hoping to sign it in Beijing, and that some Soviet employees will join the work of the China Changchun Railway. This has now been confirmed to be inaccurate. There are currently more than ten Russians on the railway, some of whom are Soviet citizens, but it is true that China and the Soviet Union are discussing the matter in Nanjing. Relevant parties on the railway said that reaching an agreement between the two sides is not as fast as rumored.

<h3>After We Vigorously Implemented Import Licenses</h3>
<h3>American Merchants Claim to Have Suffered Discrimination</h3>
<h3>Demands that the US State Department Clarify</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] It has recently been learned from here that representatives of major American firms stationed in China have recently sent a telegram to the State Department, describing the situation of being discriminated against in doing business in China, requesting clarification. It is claimed that since China promulgated new import regulations, some people have used political pressure to cause discriminatory treatment in business. The main facts are:</p>
<p>(1) American business representatives stationed in China are no longer able to obtain import licenses for goods beyond the fixed quota, while general semi-political or semi-governmental companies use their relationships to occupy a certain market share.</p>
<p>(2) These companies are also using political and other pressures to absorb agency firms and pre-emptively plan business plans that American companies started months and years ago.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the sewing-in restriction regulations on November 17 last year, American merchants have not been able to obtain import licenses for goods worth more than $5,000. As a result, heavy industrial equipment urgently needed for China's reconstruction, although ordered up to 18 months ago, cannot obtain import licenses. At the same time, independent Chinese merchants and American firms also suffer losses because applications for exchange settlement and licenses are delayed in being approved. Contracts blocked due to lack of licenses include the following goods:</p>
<p>(1) Tens of thousands of spindles urgently needed by Chinese cotton mills. (2) Wool spinning machines. (3) Steel urgently needed for buildings. (4) Mining machinery, deep well pumps, cranes, etc., which are urgently needed by China. (5) Machinery needed for steam power plants. (6) Aviation equipment for building airfields. (7) Railway equipment and wheels urgently needed for repairing transportation. (8) Wood pulp, newsprint, and wood. (9) Machines for manufacturing tung oil, sesame oil, vegetable oil, and other edible oils.</p>
<p>Although China claims to be eager to revitalize private industry and restore normal trade, it is being hindered by these policies, and it violates the commercial treaty recently discussed between China and the United States.</p>

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] Liao Yaoxiang said that the only urgent task in the Northeast at present is to earnestly promote county administration, so that the Communist army south of the Songhua River will have no room for activities, otherwise there will be no way to do anything.

<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The National Army's front line is at Zhangjialu, seven miles south of Putian. Pulandian has stabilized.

In short, the Communist army here has reached the end of the road, and it is predicted that there will only be two ways out in the future: one is to concentrate generally the power and try to break through the blockade, and the other is to retreat to the islands on the sea, such as the Changshan Islands.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The Far East Peninsula can currently be regarded as the land of happiness in southern Liaoning. The place is peaceful, and specialized goods are coming and going around the clock.

<h3>Repair of Hualien Port; Deadline of Three Months for Completion; Total Cost of NT$100 Million</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hualien Port, 3rd] Hualien Port, which is one of the three major ports in Taiwan along with Keelung and Kaohsiung, is related to the entire maritime affairs and prosperity of eastern Taiwan. The port has been in disrepair for many years and was severely damaged by six typhoons last year. According to typhoon records over the past ten years, there are only four, five, or six relatively calm months each year. The Hualien Port Bureau has decided to complete the port repair project within three months by concentrating manpower and resources, otherwise the port will become a derelict port. The total cost of emergency repairs is estimated at NT$100 million. Due to the large amount, it is planned to raise NT$30 million first to build the most important parts. Hualien Port is a man-made seaport facing the Pacific Ocean, originally known as Huilan Port, because the water flows back and forth and the waves are turbulent. Before the breakwater was built, ships could not dock. The Japanese spent 7 million Japanese yen and seven years to build the breakwater. The breakwater is divided into east and west breakwaters.

<h3>Speculation Resurfaces in Jinan; Prices Rise Generally, Market Stagnates; Over 600 Businesses Announce Closure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] A speculative wind has hit Jinan. Since the Spring Festival, the grocery, tea oil, grain, and coal industries in the city have suffered heavy losses due to sluggish sales. According to investigations, over 600 businesses have officially announced their closure. All industries are now eagerly hoping for the military to expand and the market to expand, so that this situation will not continue to worsen and gradually improve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] Today's market conditions in Jinan are 20% to 40% higher than at the end of the year. (1) Agricultural products: no market for wheat, millet (per 100 jin) 40,000 yuan, raw rice 55,000 yuan, cotton 21,000 yuan. (2) Industrial products: flour (per bag) 40,000 yuan. After the Executive Yuan reviewed and approved the price (35,000 yuan), the black market gradually disappeared. 20-count Fengshan cotton yarn 2.55 million yuan, raw oil 124,000 yuan per 100 jin. Oil mills have not yet started work, and raw rice has increased in price. The recent outlook is not for a decline. (3) Minerals: Zibo lump coal (per ton) 350,000 yuan, up 30% from the end of the year, fine coal 120,000 yuan, salt 30,000 yuan per 100 jin, up 33% from before the Lunar New Year due to increased taxes. This year's red market is generally bullish. The reasons are: (1) Stimulated by the issuance of customs gold certificates, speculators are taking advantage of this to stir up trouble. (2) The gold price is rising sharply, breaking through 550,000. (3) After the industrial and commercial sectors passed the New Year, most are taking a wait-and-see attitude. (4) Agricultural product reserves are not large, and prices are rising in other areas. (5) The "heavy goods, light currency" concept of merchants has revived. (6) Idle funds are causing trouble, and speculation is resurfacing. (7) The price of American goods is rising, and domestic goods are rising. In short, the prices of various goods are rising sharply, but with weak social purchasing power and high interest rates, the market is becoming increasingly sluggish. The difference in gold prices between Chongqing and Shanghai remains significant.</p>

<h3>Civil Aviation Meteorological Authorities Closely Consult and Coordinate; Meteorological Equipment at Airports to be Strengthened</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] In view of the recent series of aircraft accidents, most of which are related to meteorology, the Civil Aviation Administration, in addition to (1) accelerating meteorological communication, (2) strengthening meteorological equipment at each airport, and (3) increasing the number of daily observations, has recently consulted with the meteorological authorities on how to closely coordinate to make navigation safer. It is reported that the two sides are still in preliminary discussions. In principle, the two sides agreed that the meteorological authorities should assist the Civil Aviation Administration in carrying out forecasting work at various central stations. According to informed sources, the most difficult aspect of meteorological work in China is the lack of instruments. The instruments ordered from the United States will not arrive until May or June of this year. Although there are some meteorological instruments among the surplus materials, it is still necessary to conduct a survey in Shanghai to determine whether they can be used. Furthermore, the meteorological undertakings in China are far from the standards of Europe and the United States, and the establishment of meteorological stations throughout the country is uneven. The relevant authorities are planning to increase the number of radio stations in North China and the Northeast, so that meteorological information can be widespread throughout the country. At the same time, cooperation with international organizations is also being strengthened.</p>
<h3>Essential Points for Compiling Annual Final Accounts: Executive Yuan Orders Subordinate Agencies to Comply</h3>

These points were jointly decided upon by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, convening accounting personnel from central agencies and representatives from auditing bodies. The essential points are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Compilation Deadline: (1) Agencies that have not yet compiled and submitted their final accounts for the 33rd year of the Republic [1944] should have their second-level responsible agencies complete the compilation by the end of February of the 36th year of the Republic [1947], and submit three copies to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and another copy to the responsible first-level agency.

If the first-level agency itself has not yet compiled and submitted its final accounts for the 34th year, it should be completed within the aforementioned deadline and submit three copies to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The final accounts of agencies directly under the National Government should be compiled and submitted according to the aforementioned deadline.

<h3>Editorial: The Crux of the Dalian Problem</h3>
<p>When Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui spoke with reporters in Nanjing yesterday about the issue of taking over Dalian, he stated, "Small problems cannot be discussed until the big problems are resolved. Recently, the municipal government sent people to inspect Dalian City. There are 40,000 to 50,000 Communist troops within the city, and Soviet troops are not stationed there. The city lacks food, and some people have starved to death." Gong continued, "I have also frequently met with Ambassador Petrov in Nanjing. The ambassador has asked when we plan to take over, saying that both land and sea routes can be used. The problem lies with the Communist troops. If only a small number of people are sent, the takeover cannot be achieved. If troops are sent to assist, a major conflict with the Communist troops will inevitably occur." According to news reports, the focus of the Dalian takeover is: (1) How the Sino-Soviet parties jointly manage the Japanese industries that are to be taken over; (2) How the Sino-Soviet parties jointly maintain law and order. It is said that the latter has been resolved, while there are major differences of opinion on the former. At the same time as the Dalian mayor's statement, news from the United States also raised our concerns about the Dalian issue.</p>
<p>U.S. Republican Senator Bridges recently issued a statement on U.S. foreign policy, stating, "The Soviet Union's activity in another corner of the world is also worthy of attention. The plundering of Manchuria has set back China's development by several generations. A great power stood by while China fought a desperate battle, only joining the war in the week that Japan was defeated, and now it controls China's ports, railways, and cities. It was American pressure that made China give up most of its land and sovereignty. In return, Moscow clearly promised to help the Chinese National Government and its army take over the rule of Manchuria and other regions. Therefore, the United States cannot be indifferent to Russia's failure to fulfill its promises and its treatment of China not as an ally but as if it were a defeated country." At the same time, the Howard newspaper of the United States stated, "We have already seen the Moscow-style 'coalition government' in places like Poland and Yugoslavia, and we do not want to see the emergence of such a coalition government again. It is necessary for the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement in the Far East, but first, the U.S. and Soviet troops in Korea, Manchuria, and the liberated areas of China must be withdrawn, so that the people of each country can freely organize their own governments according to their own needs and aspirations. For the United States and the Soviet Union, this is the only truly democratic way to solve the Far East problem."</p>
<p>Now that the United States has declared that it is abandoning mediation and preparing to withdraw its troops stationed in China, and the takeover of Dalian has not even begun to show promise, it is truly regrettable. According to the Dalian mayor's statement, there are no Soviet troops in Dalian, but there are 40,000 to 50,000 Communist troops. According to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 1945, the Soviet Union has an obligation to assist the Chinese National Government in taking over the rule of Dalian, but for more than a year, the Soviet Union seems to have not only failed to provide the aforementioned assistance, but has also allowed a military regime that resists the Chinese government to be established in Dalian, which is a very regrettable matter. As for the reported point of how the Sino-Soviet parties should jointly manage the Japanese industries to be taken over, this really should not become a problem. According to reason, the Japanese industries in Dalian should be taken over by China, and that should not be a problem. If, in fact, the Japanese industries in Dalian have been completely changed beyond recognition over the past year or so, that can also be resolved through negotiation, and it seems that this should not delay the takeover of Dalian.</p>
<p>Regarding the Dalian issue, it is still remembered that on the 3rd of last month, the US government sent a note to the governments of China and the Soviet Union requesting that the two countries implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty agreement on Dalian, so that Dalian could return to normal under the administration of the Chinese government. In this note: "The United States government recognizes that this issue should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and the Soviet Union, but for the general interest, the United States must consider itself responsible for raising this issue with the two governments directly concerned." At that time, this newspaper published an article urging China and the Soviet Union to implement the agreement on Dalian: "It is hoped that the Soviet Union can reflect on itself, cherish the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and earnestly fulfill all treaties between China and the Soviet Union." However, it has been more than a month since the aforementioned note was issued, and the takeover of Dalian has still not become a reality.</p>
<p>According to the statement of the mayor of Dalian, he maintains regular contact with Ambassador Petrov, and the Sino-Soviet representatives are once again meeting in Pulandian, so the progress of the takeover of Dalian has not stalled. Given the recent statement by the United States that it is preparing to withdraw its troops stationed in China, we hope that in order to fulfill the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, except as stipulated in the treaty, the Soviet Union should also withdraw its troops stationed in China as soon as possible. As for the anti-government armed regimes in the Soviet sphere of influence, they should not be allowed to exist and should be eliminated in a timely manner. Then, the takeover of Dalian can be realized in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>China Textile Corporation Willing to Donate Mulberry Saplings: Farmers Afraid to Receive and Plant Them; Low Cocoon Prices Make it Difficult to Revitalize Sericulture</h3>

Finance Director Chen Baolin and others also returned to Hangzhou on the same train. Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Textile Corporation, came to Hangzhou at the invitation of Chairman Shen to discuss the silk industry in Zhejiang Province. He lectured at the provincial government's memorial week today on the current status of the silk industry in various countries, saying that today's national financial policy is aimed at stabilizing prices, and foreign exchange cannot be flexibly adjusted, which is detrimental to the silk industry, leading to the closure of silk factories, the cessation of silkworm rearing by silkworm farmers, and the disappearance of production. The future is worrying. Zhejiang Province originally had abundant silk production, and China Textile Corporation is willing to donate 15 million mulberry saplings, but farmers are afraid to receive and plant them because cocoon prices are Kang, which makes it unprofitable. Therefore, the provincial government hopes to use political power to support and develop silk.</p>

<h3>UN Security Council to Reopen Today, US and Soviet Views Remain Distant</h3>
<p>Disarmament and Atomic Energy Control Cases Face Another Test</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] The United States has a firm stance on the issues of universal disarmament and atomic energy control, which will face another test at tomorrow's Security Council meeting. However, judging from the current situation, its progress may not be smooth. First, the Soviet Pravda stated that the US atomic energy control plan seems likely to be rejected. All five countries with veto power in the Security Council, except the Soviet Union, have accepted the US plan, so this statement by the newspaper is equivalent to the Soviet Union preparing to obstruct it. Second, the US plan was presented to representatives of other countries in advance, and many expressed indifference, which aroused strong opposition from the Soviet Union. However, despite the unfavorable situation, US Representative Austin does not intend to change his original intention. Austin's plan was drafted after meetings with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. It is reported that Washington has received full reports on the preliminary discussions between Austin and the representatives. The Soviet Union insists on retaining the veto power when sanctioning any country that violates atomic energy control, while the United States has repeatedly stated that it should be abolished. Austin's plan includes three points: (1) Establish a disarmament committee, which must not interfere with the work of the Atomic Energy Commission or deal with any weapons of mass destruction; (2) First set up a drafting sub-committee to define the scope of work of the disarmament committee; (3) At the next Security Council meeting, discuss the report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Baltimore, 3rd] US Senator Tydings recently stated in a radio address: Even if atomic bombs are prohibited, they will still be used in the event of war. Since the United Nations cannot regard atomic bombs as illegal during the period of peace between two wars, it should find a way to eliminate this weapon once and for all. This matter should be resolved in conjunction with the general disarmament issue and should not be dealt with separately.</p>
<h3>Truman's New Approach: Resolving International Disputes Through Normal Diplomatic Channels; Marshall to Visit Germany and Austria En Route to Moscow; Bevin Does Not Plan to Fly to Moscow</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd Radio: The Three-Power Summit Meeting was a system adopted by the late President Roosevelt during the war. According to reliable sources, President Truman has abandoned this system and advocates using normal "diplomatic methods" or foreign ministers' meetings to resolve international issues. Although President Truman declared that if Stalin and Attlee could come to Washington, a Three-Power Summit Meeting could be held, in reality, President Truman believes that even a Three-Power Summit Meeting in Washington is unnecessary. He believes that he should meet with the leaders of various countries individually and cannot exclude France. In addition, senior officials of the US State Department are against summit meetings, believing that such meetings are tantamount to diplomats overstepping their bounds. They also pointed out the following reasons why such meetings should not be held: (1) Summit meetings should only be held during wartime; (2) Summit meetings may cause rumors of secret treaties; (3) Summit meetings are not suitable for democratic countries, but only beneficial to dictatorial countries such as the Soviet Union; (4) Summit meetings are actually a formula for the Soviet Union to divide the world.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin has decided to travel to Moscow by sea and rail to attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference instead of by plane.

<h3>Soviet Attitude on Austrian Peace Treaty Unclear</h3>
<p>Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference Encounters Obstacles Again</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd Radio: The British Foreign Office expressed optimism about the prospects of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference, believing that the conference has been half completed. However, the American observation does not think so, believing that the Soviet Union is deliberately delaying the signing of the Austrian peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] The prospect of concluding the Austrian peace treaty seems to depend on whether the Soviet Union is willing to make concessions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference this week. According to reliable sources, the three main obstacles to the current work on the Austrian peace treaty are (1) the handling of industrial property in Austria and Germany, and (2) how to ensure that Austria will not merge with any country in the future. It is learned that whether the Soviet Union is willing to withdraw its troops stationed in Austria within ninety days after the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty can be decided this week. If the Soviet Union is willing to do so, the other three powers will not hesitate to withdraw their troops, and the French army is willing to withdraw even earlier.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Fear of Communism Is the Key to US-Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>Eleanor Roosevelt's View</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] Eleanor Roosevelt stated in "Look Magazine" today that the United States must eliminate its fear and hatred of communism as much as possible before it can cooperate with the Soviet Union, just like its cooperation with Britain. The two countries have different political and economic views, but these views are not necessarily immutable.

Truman also requested that the terms of three wartime privilege bills be extended to March 31, 1948, namely (1) the right to stipulate rationing priorities. The continuation of this bill is extremely important because grains, flour, rice, sugar, syrup, fats, oils, meat, milk products, beans, fish, quinine, hides, organic bases, rubber fibers, hemp, tin, antimony, etc. are still in short supply; (2) allowing the Shipping Commission to operate certain routes, and allowing the Army and Navy to transport their service personnel in areas where company transportation is inconvenient; (3) allowing shipping to be carried out under the current restrictions, which are related to equipment and personnel. Truman stated that this point is necessary for the repatriation and supply transportation of troops stationed overseas and is related to the issue of repatriation. Truman stated that if various controls continue to be extended, the date of their abolition should be done as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Novikov's Speech Emphasizes US-Soviet Friendship to Avoid Being Exploited</h3>
<p>[United Press, Miami, Florida, 2nd] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov stated today in a speech to the Miami branch of the US-Soviet Friendship Association that the shadows that have recently darkened US-Soviet relations do not truly reflect the state of affairs between the two great nations. The new war panic in 1946 was created by "certain political groups" to promote a new war, sow anxiety and suspicion, and facilitate exploitation. Former British Prime Minister Churchill is one of them, who has appeared openly or coyly, engaging in organized obstruction and advocating "alliance" against the Soviet Union. Novikov also emphasized friendship with the United States, saying that the Soviet people greatly admire and will never forget the assistance and brilliant achievements of the American people. The friendship between the people of the four countries, who played an important role in the struggle to defeat the common enemy, should shoulder a greater mission in today's peaceful times.</p>

<h3>French Government Recalls Commander of Hanoi Region, Policy Toward Vietnam May Soften</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The French government telegraphed General Morlière, the commander of the French army in Hanoi, to return to the country on the 2nd, which proves that France is preparing to adopt a peaceful policy towards Vietnam. Morlière left Hanoi for Paris today, and at the same time, Cetenat, the French commissioner of Tonkin Province in Vietnam, flew to Saigon to meet with Dalat, the high commissioner of Vietnam. However, the reason for Morlière's return has not yet been revealed, but it is known that Laune and his senior military and political advisors reviewed the situation in Vietnam for two hours last night, after which the order to recall Morlière was issued. Although French Colonial Minister Moutet stated that the above meeting was to discuss transportation and the evacuation of overseas Chinese, according to French media observers, the French government believes that the time to resolve the Vietnam issue peacefully has matured. Although the French army has achieved initial success, one observer believes that the French government intends to adopt a policy of compromise with the Viet Minh government, replace the military governor with a civilian official. The replacement of Dalat and other officials is one of the main demands put forward by Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd Radio: The French and Vietnamese authorities in northern Vietnam are each reinforcing their troops in Hanoi and taking strict measures to consolidate their positions.

<h3>Various Aspects of the Anglo-French Alliance</h3>
<p>If the United Kingdom and France can formally conclude a treaty of alliance, it will contribute to maintaining the security and peace of Europe, but its significance is not as great as the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The recent ambiguity of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the treaty has made many European countries uneasy.</p>
<p>After French Prime Minister Blum visited London, he announced the news that the United Kingdom and France would conclude an alliance treaty, which seemed a bit sudden. But the agreement itself is not surprising at all. The British and French governments have repeatedly expressed their willingness to conclude a treaty of alliance, but it has not been successful because the French cabinet insisted on putting forward conditions before the negotiations.</p>
<p>The Process of Anglo-French Treaty Negotiations</p>
<p>When this issue was raised shortly after the liberation of Europe, because General de Gaulle was very unhappy about the events in Syria and Lebanon, he insisted that these two issues must be resolved first before he would consider negotiating the treaty. Not only that, he further wanted Britain to support his proposal to separate the Rhineland and the Ruhr area from Germany. But Britain was unwilling to buy this.</p>
<p>De Gaulle resigned last year. The acting [Prime Minister] Gouin was very much in favor of concluding a treaty. However, Bidault was still the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, and he still insisted that Britain must support France's demands on the Rhineland before the treaty could be discussed. As a result, to the regret of Gouin and the British ministers, the proposal for the treaty was once again abandoned. Bevin reported in the House of Commons that "the alliance between the two countries must be based on mutual friendship without conditions." Blum took a broader and more realistic attitude towards this issue, so that the original problem was no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The Three Great Powers of Europe Form an Integrated Whole</p>
<p>Unless unexpected difficulties arise, this Anglo-French negotiation should be very brief. Because everyone believes that the Anglo-French treaty should be in the same format as the Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Franco-Soviet treaty. After the Anglo-French treaty is signed, the three great powers of Europe can help each other in the event that Germany rises again in the future. However, people can't help but ask this question: Is this three-nation alliance system as strong in fact as it is on paper? We must not ignore several disturbing signs: the most obvious of which is the Soviet Union, which occupies an important position in the triangular alliance. Recently, there has been a definite lack of enthusiasm for the alliance.</p>
<p>Bevin's True Meaning Was Misunderstood by the Soviet Union</p>
<p>First, when Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed extending the term of the Anglo-Soviet treaty from 20 years to 50 years, the Soviet government did not respond. Soviet newspapers instead asked, what is the value of this treaty, whether it is 20 years or 50 years? Recently, the official newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party even accused Bevin of denying the obligations of the treaty in his Christmas night speech, taking it out of context. In fact, what Bevin said was merely an explanation that British policy was not bound by American policy. He said that British policy is not bound by any country except to fulfill the obligations of the UN Charter. This meaning is very clear, especially since these alliances between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are definitely regarded by Britain as part of the UN system, and their obligations are of course within the scope of the Charter obligations.</p>
<p>But this sentence was misinterpreted by the Soviet Union to make the whole world—including Germany—know that at least part of the security mechanism is inactive, or that the Soviet Union has regarded this part as inactive. However, we note that if Moscow was truly worried about the meaning of Bevin's words, why did they not immediately ask Britain to "explain"? They did not ask or request an explanation, but suddenly launched an attack three weeks after the speech was published.</p>
<p>The Soviet Attitude Is Disturbing</p>
<p>We are not very clear about the motives behind the Soviet Union's actions. But one of the results is very obvious. In this way, it cannot but arouse the hopes of German nationalists. They think that the security mechanism may be just a façade. If Germany makes a considerable response to the Soviet Union's constant expressions of friendship, perhaps the Soviet Union will soon change from a caretaker to a friend, or even become a neutral country in the future when Germany has conflicts with Western countries.</p>
<p>In this way, the unsoundness of the European security system lies in the ambiguous attitude of the Soviet ally and Germany. If the Soviet Union can clearly announce its policy and accept the proposal to extend the Anglo-Soviet treaty to 50 years, it will strengthen European security more than the Anglo-French treaty.

<h3>Unified Command of Military, Police, and Gendarmerie; Formation of Nine Inspection Brigades; City Divided into Eight Districts with an Additional Water Area; Hotel Inspections Limited to Completion Before Midnight</h3>
<p>The city area is vast and the population large. The Garrison Headquarters Inspection Department, the Gendarmerie Regiment, and the Police Bureau each have their duties in maintaining public order, conducting inspections, and handling related cases. However, there are unavoidable overlaps. For example, regarding the night-time inspection of hotels, the military, police, and gendarmerie are all obligated to conduct inspections to prevent evildoers from hiding. However, ordinary travelers generally find this troublesome. It is now learned that Commander Xuan of the Garrison Headquarters, recognizing this, has decided to unify the military, police, and gendarmerie within the garrison area. Eight inspection districts and one water inspection district will be established within the area, jointly organized by personnel from the Inspection Department, Police Bureau, and the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment. Each inspection district will form an inspection brigade consisting of personnel from the military, police, and gendarmerie. The organization, tasks, and inspection methods are detailed in the organizational regulations of the Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters. After the inspection brigade is established, the Inspection Department, Gendarmerie Regiment, and Police Bureau will no longer conduct inspections independently. Hotel inspections are stipulated to be completed before 12:00 midnight.</p>
<p>Inspection Procedures Strive for Simplification</p>
<p>It is further stipulated that inspection procedures should be simplified. Ordinary people will be handled by the police, while military personnel will be handled by the gendarmerie. The inspection officers dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters are responsible for on-site command and supervision. The Garrison Headquarters has already drafted these organizational regulations for the inspection brigade and Commander Xuan reviewed and revised them yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. He has ordered his subordinates to establish all district inspection brigades by the 10th of this month and formally announce the organizational regulations for implementation.</p>
<p>District Division Already Determined</p>
<p>The division of inspection districts has been finalized. There are a total of eight inspection districts and one water inspection district: The first district includes Huangpu, Laoza, and Xincheng; the second district includes Hongkou, the southern part of the North Station, and the southern part of Zhabei; the third district includes Taishan and Chujiawan; the fourth district includes Yilian and Penglai; the fifth district includes Xinshi Street, North Sichuan Road, the northern part of the North Station, the northern part of Zhabei, Yangshupu, Yulin, and Tilanqiao; the sixth district includes Putuo, Jiangning, Jing'an Temple, Changning, and Xinjing; the seventh district includes Changshu, Xujiahui, and Longhua; the eighth district includes Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Yangsi; the water inspection district includes all rivers within the garrison area.</p>

<h3>Bishop Huijijing Takes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Bishop Huijijing held the inaugural oath ceremony at the Dongjiadu Catholic Church in Nanshi at 8:30 yesterday morning. Archbishop Liberati, the first papal nuncio to China, came to Shanghai from Nanjing to administer the oath on behalf of the Pope. Those attending the ceremony included Nanjing Bishop Yu Bin, Nanchang Archbishop Zhou, Zhumadian Bishop Yuan, Shanghai Catholic Action Association President Zhu Zhiyao, Lu Yinggeng, and Vice Bishops Ge and Zhang, Zhang Boda, Zhang Madi, Father Wu Yingfeng, as well as Ye Qiuyuan, Fan Zhengbo, Xu Tongyuan, Song Hanzhang, Zhu Kong　, He Lizhong, Wang Baolun, and other male and female Catholics numbering thousands, gathered together in unprecedented splendor. The ceremony was solemn and grand. First, Archbishop Hui took the holy oath, followed by Nuncio Liberati reading the Papal letter of commission. Bishop Yu Bin ascended the pulpit to praise the bishop's past management of diocesan affairs and to encourage the Shanghai Catholic Action Association to continue its efforts in charity and education in the spirit of the late President Bohong. Subsequently, Nuncio Liberati solemnly conducted a grand Mass. The Yixin Elementary and Middle School military band and the Catholic Salesian Society choir sang scriptures. The music was sonorous and the songs were bright. The ceremony lasted two hours. At the end, Nuncio Liberati, on behalf of the Pope, bestowed blessings on all the Catholics in the church. After the Mass, the Shanghai Diocesan Catholic Action Association and other groups and representatives of Catholics held a celebration in the auditorium. During the event, Lu Yinggeng raised his glass, representing all groups and male and female Catholics, to congratulate Archbishop Hui on his inauguration, wishing him good health and expressing the affection of all Catholics. Cheers resounded. Archbishop Hui then delivered a thank you speech and the event ended with photographs.</p>

<h3>Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Representatives Reschedule Trip to Nanjing for This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The delegation of the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, Luo Weiji, Zhou Shouyu, Hu Richou, He Shouyan, and Secretary Shi Zuolun, originally scheduled to go to Nanjing last night, have changed their trip to an early train this morning due to ticket issues. They plan to stay in Nanjing for about a week, intending to appeal for assistance to the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Overseas Department, and the Central Party Headquarters. They also plan to visit President Chiang to request protection and relief for the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Philippines Flights of Far Eastern Air Transport to Resume Soon</h3>
<p>Far Eastern Air Transport of the Philippines was ordered to suspend flights after the "Miss Luzon" accident. It is now learned that the suspension period has expired and all Far Eastern Air Transport flights, except those to Shanghai, have resumed. According to a responsible person at the company's Shanghai office, flights between Shanghai and the Philippines will also resume in the near future.</p>
<p>(Another report) For Sino-French air transport affairs, China National Aviation Corporation has decided to dispatch aircraft to Bangkok and major cities in Vietnam in the near future to inspect routes and various facilities, in order to decide on the opening of air routes. According to personnel from the French airline's Shanghai office, after the initial inspection mission of the China National Aviation Corporation is completed, the French airline will send aircraft for a second trial flight to China to discuss the date for the simultaneous opening of air routes by both China and France.</p>
<h3>49 Airfields Planned Between Guangzhou-Nanjing and Chengdu-Shanghai Routes; Pilots Consider it Impractical</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation flight personnel recently organized a pilots association, including 65 American pilots, co-pilots, navigators, and radio operators, and 150 Chinese personnel. The association held its fourth regular meeting last night to discuss the Civil Aviation Administration's recently proposed flight improvement plan and other related civil aviation matters.</p>
<p>The association submitted a letter to President Chiang, President Song, Minister Yu, and Director Dai three weeks ago, suggesting that the wireless communications and all aviation facilities along all routes should be planned, closely coordinated, and operated by the government. Any licensed aircraft should be able to land at any airfield in case of emergency. The Civil Aviation Administration announced a plan last Friday to build 49 small airfields along the Guangzhou-Nanjing and Shanghai-Chengdu (including the Kunming branch line) north-south and east-west routes. This can be seen as an indirect response to their suggestions. However, this plan is estimated to take ten months to complete, and experienced pilots believe it is too wasteful and impractical.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of German Overseas Chinese to be Repatriated Mid-Month; Each Allowed to Take US$200</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The second batch of German overseas Chinese will be repatriated to Germany on the 16th of this month. The relevant foreign affairs authorities in the city have made the necessary preparations, notifying all German overseas Chinese to get vaccinated and ordering them to find guarantors to avoid any unexpected incidents. Those who fail to find guarantors will be housed in the British barracks on Great Western Road as a gathering place before boarding the ship. Each person is allowed to take US$200 when leaving Shanghai, and the amount of luggage will be determined according to the amount of luggage taken by German overseas Chinese repatriated from Tokyo. It is understood that there are still over a thousand German overseas Chinese remaining in China, mostly employed by various agencies. In the past, there was a German overseas Chinese concentration camp in Jiangwan, but it was closed after the first batch of repatriations last year, so there is no longer a dedicated management agency.</p>
<h3>Repeatedly Proven Effective in Ancient Books; Foreign Reporters Go Wild Trying to Stand Eggs on the Night of Lichun (Start of Spring)</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Today is the Lunar Lichun (Start of Spring) in China. According to ancient Chinese books "Tongtian Jian" and "Kexue Huajing", eggs can stand upright on this day, regardless of size.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:45 PM, the moment of the start of Lichun, the home of Wei Jingrong, director of the International Propaganda Office in Shanghai, gathered many foreign reporters, including Randall from the United Press, Mrs. Wales from the International News Service, and Frank Shaw from Reader's Digest. They scrambled to stand eggs on the floor, with great enthusiasm, as if drunk, and were extremely excited.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wei, eggs can stand at any time, but they are especially easy to stand at Lichun. During Lichun two years ago, he entertained foreign reporters at his home and demonstrated standing eggs. The foreigners were very excited. After "Life" published the photos, it caused a sensation throughout the United States. To this day, the enthusiasm has not waned. According to reports, eggs in New York have been bought up by "standing egg guests."</p>
<p>Eggs can stand not only on dirt, but also on cement, floors, tables, glass, mirrors, and cups.</p>
<p>The time required to stand an egg varies. Some happen by chance, and stand as soon as they are placed down. Others require one or two minutes of patience and effort. Of course, there are also those that stand after an hour. According to the reporter's observation, the first requirement for standing an egg is calmness.</p>
<p>As for the reason why eggs stand on this day, there is no definite answer, and the great scientist Einstein once dismissed the "egg can stand at Lichun" theory as nonsense.</p>
<p>The reporter has heard several explanations, which are mentioned "for what it's worth." One theory is that the air density is particularly dense at Lichun, so it is easier to stand. Another is that a "yang energy" rises from the ground before and after "Lichun". Still another theory is that the yolk condenses and sinks. But these are mostly unreliable theories. The correct explanation still awaits scientific research. (The photo shows the enthusiastic scene of standing eggs, taken by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Bandits Invade Xinqiao Town; Self-Defense Corps Surrounded and Disarmed; Shanghai Police Bureau Orders All Branches to Assist in Apprehension</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, more than a hundred bandits suddenly rushed from the direction of Songjiang to Xinqiao Town in the suburbs of Songjiang. Armed with light and heavy machine guns, new-style Mauser pistols, and other weapons, they surrounded the self-defense corps stationed in the town. Although the corps members discovered them at the time, they were outnumbered and ultimately had over twenty large and small firearms confiscated and fled. Afterwards, the person in charge of the corps reported to his superiors, requesting assistance in apprehension. After receiving this information, the patrol police of the Longhua Police Bureau urgently reported to Branch Chief Lu Bihu. Due to the seriousness of the situation, he telegraphed the General Bureau to report. The police then returned the order to all branches in the city to pay close attention to assisting in the apprehension.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lianhang Released from Prison After Serving Sentence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Lianhang, known as the "King of Hardware" in Shanghai, was sentenced to one year and four months in prison by the High Court on October 28 last year. He was released from prison yesterday after serving his sentence, with the approval of the High Court.</p>
<p>Zhang is from Ningbo, 48 years old this year, and served as the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, the director of the pseudo-Hardware Joint Office, and the Bao head of the Sixth Bao of the First Lianbao in the pseudo-Huangpu District.

<h3>Jiang Wei Presents Evidence in Rebuttal, Claiming He Took the Blame for Others</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jiang Weicheng, who was accused of serving as the director of the pseudo-Nantong Income Tax Bureau, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. His defense lawyer, Tang Huaiqun, presented evidence stating: According to an investigation by the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce, there is no person named Jiang Weicheng, only Ge Jiangzhen served as the pseudo-director of the bureau in the county, which proves that the defendant is taking the blame for others. The court announced the conclusion of the debate in the case and set the sentencing for the morning of the 10th.</p>
<h3>Liu Mingqi and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to sources at the High Prosecutor's Office: The cases of suspected traitors Liu Mingqi and Huang Guochun have been investigated and are being prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Police Bureau Detective Claims He Was a Nominal Employee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Bu Zhankui, who was accused of serving as a detective in the pseudo-Jiangwan Police Branch and later as a member of the enemy Gendarmerie, was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant argued: In order to avoid extortion from enemy and puppet police and gendarmerie during the enemy and puppet period, he nominally held the position of a detective in the Jiangwan Police Branch, but never went to the branch. The court ordered further investigation and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Legislator Wu Wen Submits Petition for Sentence Reduction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Wen, a pseudo-legislator, committed murder during the enemy and puppet period and was imprisoned. After the victory, he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. The prisoner Wu heard about the amnesty decree issued by the National Government at Shanghai Prison, and specially hired a lawyer to submit a petition to the High Prosecutor's Office for a sentence reduction. The petition was sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>A Lucky Survivor from the Disaster; Paul Vreede's Condition Improves; To Be Sent Back to the United States in Six Weeks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paul Vreede, the only survivor of China National Aviation Corporation Flight 145, which crashed in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, on January 28, was only 14 months old. He was flown to Shanghai by special plane and suffered only a hip injury. He is currently being treated at Hong En Hospital. It is reported that his condition has improved further yesterday and the lucky child seems to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Taylor, a person in charge of the local church, Paul Vreede may need to recuperate in the hospital for six weeks. Once he recovers, he will be sent back to the United States for care, according to the wishes of his grandparents.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor also said that Paul Vreede's parents and three-year-old elder brother were buried in Hankou yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The Vreede couple came to China to work in the church, and now that they have unfortunately died, they are buried in China.</p>
<h3>Relatives of Deceased Passengers Fly to Hankou to Handle Aftermath</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the bodies of the deceased passengers of China National Aviation Corporation Flight 145 from Shanghai to Chongqing were transported to Hankou, some were buried locally yesterday, and the company will assist the remaining family members who wish to transport the bodies back to their hometowns. Ten Chinese and foreign family members residing in Shanghai boarded a free flight to Hankou the day before yesterday to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>[Another report] When the reporter visited a spokesperson for China National Aviation Corporation yesterday and asked whether the company's board of directors could adopt and implement the suggestions from various sectors to improve flight safety facilities, he said: The most difficult thing is the lack of funds. The country is too poor and many plans cannot be realized. As for the rumors that the company's general manager, Shen Deshe, had resigned to take responsibility, the spokesperson flatly denied them.</p>
<h3>Post Office to Launch Registered Mail with Declared Value Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After resuming insured parcels, the Shanghai Postal Administration will launch registered mail with declared value from February 1. The maximum declared value is 50,000 yuan, and it is not limited to airmail. Registered mail with declared value can be sent to all large and small locations with domestic postal services. For items exceeding 50,000 yuan, insured parcels will be used. In addition, the postal district delivery system planned by the bureau has been decided to be implemented from February 1. Currently, it is training personnel for this system and printing various charts for distribution to citizens. After this system is implemented, it can save half the manpower.</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Exhausted; 100,000 Tons of Garbage; Still Uncleared</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's garbage and feces problem has not yet been properly resolved. The Health Bureau will invite all relevant parties to convene a cleanliness conference in mid-February to discuss improving transportation methods and management systems. It is heard that commercial cleaning companies may be contracted to transport the waste.</p>
<p>According to the Health Bureau, the city currently has only two-thirds of the garbage transportation tools and three-fifths of the workers it had before the war. Based on the commodity price index for the second half of 1946, the funding is only two-thirds of what it was before the war. However, the amount of garbage produced has increased by one-third compared to before the war. The Health Bureau is limited by funding and cannot expand its work. Sanitation workers are paid low wages, so they often solicit liquor money from merchants during the holidays. Although public notices have been issued to strictly prohibit this, it is feared that it will still be difficult to avoid in reality. Therefore, it was previously suggested that a cleaning surcharge or cleaning tax be established to improve the treatment of sanitation workers, so that they can work with peace of mind and increase work efficiency. This tax is also established in many inland cities. However, it was ultimately rejected by the City Council. Before the war, there was one sanitation worker for every 500 residents in the city, but now there is one for every 800. During the enemy and puppet period, a total of 100,000 tons of garbage accumulated in the ruins of Nanshi and Zhabei, but due to funding limitations, it has not been possible to clear it to this day. Currently, it can only ensure that no more is added.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Electric Heating to be Lifted; Giant Generator Arrives in Shanghai and is Installed; Electricity to Increase by More Than 30,000 Kilowatts Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The 22,500-kilowatt generator of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which was shipped to the United States for repairs last year, arrived here a few days ago and has been installed. It is currently being tested. It will be officially generating electricity in a week. However, due to the limited number of boilers in use and the need to repair some old generators, the electricity increase at that time will only be six or seven thousand kilowatts.</p>
<p>The company's high-pressure boilers and generators will not be repaired until the end of this month. After all work is completed, the city's electricity supply can be increased by more than 30,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>It is understood that the restrictions on the use of electric heating may be lifted in mid-March.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Woman from Nanhui Dies Tragically; Coffin Moved to Shanghai for Re-examination; Truth of Death Revealed; Determined to Be Drowning</h3>
<p>The case of a husband allegedly murdering his wife in Nanhui County, which caused a sensation, was re-examined yesterday morning at the Tongren Yuantang Mortuary on Linsen East Road in Shanghai because the local judicial authorities lacked the equipment for re-examination.</p>
<p>The case involves Sun Meigen, a 41-year-old farmer from Sunjiaqiang Circle in Northwest Tanzhi Bridge Town, Nanhui County (who served as a pseudo-township chief during the enemy and puppet period), who married Ms. Gu, also known as Gu Xiaomei or Gu Jinying, 42 years old. The couple had been married for 24 years. They had a very good relationship and had three sons and two daughters, all of whom were grown. Sun was fond of women and had an affair with Min Xinjuan, the wife of carpenter Ah Qi, when he served in the pseudo-government. He rented a house outside and lived with her as husband and wife, treating his first wife as a thorn in his side. On the morning of December 6 last year, Ms. Gu was suddenly found dead in a nearby creek. Township Chief Zhong Bin reported the case to the Xinchang Public Office, which forwarded it to the county judicial authorities. On December 8, personnel were sent to the countryside to examine the body. The examination found no injuries on the body and determined that she had drowned. After reporting the situation, Gu Yubing and others, relatives of the deceased, believed that the deceased had told her nephews and nieces that "I will surely die of illness, never commit suicide." Her sudden death was definitely murder, and her husband was avoiding them. They petitioned the judicial authorities to request a re-examination to clear her name. The judicial authorities approved the re-examination and had the body transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang Mortuary in Shanghai. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Wei Ligong, director of forensic medicine at the local prosecutor's office, and forensic doctor Gong Ziwei, arrived at the scene for the re-examination. The county judicial police chief and the corpse's relatives also arrived to watch. The morticians then removed the body, which had been blackened, from the coffin and placed it on a wooden platform. Forensic doctor Wei and others dissected the body, removing all the heart and lungs. After the procedure was completed in one and a half hours, the morticians were ordered to prepare the body for burial. At that time, in order to understand the truth of the death, the relatives asked Director Wei whether the deceased was thrown into the river after death or drowned while alive. Forensic doctor Wei replied that based on the observations, the body was determined to have drowned while alive, for the following reasons: (1) When the body was found floating in the creek, the back was facing up and the abdomen was facing down, which is the opposite if the body was thrown in after death. (2) The current examination found water in the lungs and stomach of the body. If the body had been thrown into the river after death, there would be no water in the lungs and stomach.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Seafood Smuggled; Customs Investigating</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the situation of the customs seizing large quantities of smuggled goods, the reporter interviewed Shen Shikun, deputy commissioner of the anti-smuggling section of the Shanghai Customs, who said: The seizure of smuggled seafood is indeed the case, the value is very large, and it involves more than two ships. The smuggled goods were transported from Korea. The details are currently under investigation. Shen also said that Shanghai's smuggling incidents have gradually decreased recently due to the strict anti-smuggling patrols of the customs. Shen previously suggested to the Ministry of Finance that severe criminal penalties be imposed on smugglers, but has not yet received a reply. Shen said that if this measure can be formulated, it is believed that it will have a positive effect on preventing smuggling.</p>
<h3>Six Suspected Traitors from Ningbo Deny Accusations; Trial Concluded Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The High Court heard the cases of six suspected traitors yesterday morning, all of whom were accused of abusing their power to oppress the local people in Ningbo during the period of its occupation by the enemy and puppets. (1) Liu Bin, from Ningbo, studied in Japan in his early years. When Ningbo was occupied, he served as a translator in the pseudo-Towns Joint Association and provided intelligence work for the enemy Gendarmerie. (2) Cai Yanbang, from Taiwan, served as a translator in the enemy Gendarmerie. (3) Huang Zhifang, from Ningbo, claimed that in order to cover up underground anti-Japanese work, he served as the director of the pseudo-Security Brigade Office. After the victory, he maintained order in Ningbo under the order of Yu Jimin, the special commissioner of the Sixth District of Zhejiang, and denied that he had extorted property from the people by relying on the enemy and puppet forces. (4) Sun Liangui, a warrant officer of the pseudo-Ningbo Security Brigade, stated: "In order to facilitate business, I nominally held the position and did not actually work." (5) Wang Jian, originally a soldier in the 17th Division of the National Army, was injured and went to Ningbo for treatment. He was arrested by Sun Liangui and served as a secret agent for the enemy Gendarmerie. (6) Lin Yifu, a former policeman in Shanghai before the war, set up a flour company and a firewood shop in Ningbo after its occupation, providing supplies to the enemy's field warehouse. The above six people appeared in court yesterday morning to be tried. They unanimously denied the points in the indictment. Rebuttal lawyers Qin Shouzhang, Cao Lin, Ge Zhi, Fang Zhong, Xia Gengkai and others defended. Chief Judge Liu announced the conclusion of the debate in the case and set the sentencing for the morning of the 10th.</p>
<h3>Two Dance Hall Girls Imprisoned for Four Years Each for Drug Use</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Li Meili, a dance hall girl from the Vienna Dance Hall, was arrested on the 16th of last month by the voluntary police of the Taishan Precinct at the Anshang Inn, No. 74 South Road, while she was using drugs. A package of heroin was confiscated. In addition, Lu Lili, a former MGM dance hall girl, was also detained at No. 32 Linyuli, Liulin Road, for drug use, and two packages of heroin were confiscated.

Although the two women vehemently denied using heroin, Judge Shao Renjie ruled that the evidence was conclusive and could not be denied, and each was sentenced to four years in prison.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Discovered in Shanghai and Guangzhou, Now Considered Plague Ports</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Smallpox has been successively discovered in Shanghai and Guangzhou, and they have now been considered plague ports. Those leaving Shanghai must hold a vaccination certificate from the Bureau of Health or the Jianghai Customs Seaport Quarantine Station in order to purchase tickets and board a ship. In addition, a typhoid vaccination certificate is also required.</p>
<h3>British Expert to Seek Welfare for the Blind Arrives in Shanghai via Hong Kong Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Sir MacQuetzy, a British welfare expert, has recently been invited by the Executive Yuan to come to China to assist the government in planning to prevent blindness, treat blindness, and provide welfare services such as relief and training for the blind. The Executive Yuan authorities have assisted the Ministry of Social Affairs in jointly operating the Reconstruction Center for the Wounded, located within the Executive Yuan's 15th Branch District. They have also provided relief supplies and funds to more than 80 units of institutions for the wounded and disabled. Mr. MacQuetzy is currently an advisor to the Indian government, engaged in blind welfare work, with more than thirty years of experience. After arriving in Shanghai, he will first go to Beijing to discuss the implementation of work matters with the authorities, and then go to various provinces to inspect blind welfare work, with a scheduled period of two months.</p>
<p>Mr. MacQuetzy has already departed from India by plane with his daughter and is expected to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Two Senior Customs Officials Investigated for Alleged Embezzlement of Enemy Property</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Ding Guitang, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, was previously reported to have embezzled materials worth 100,000,000 at No. 340 Dengtuo Road. After Liu Bingyi, the Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office stating that he would send Qian Zongqi, a Tax Commissioner in the Secretariat of the Commissioner of Customs, and Han Zhaoshu, a Deputy Tax Commissioner, to testify, Qian and Han arrived at the court yesterday in response to the District Prosecutor's Office's subpoena. They stated that the enemy materials in question were received from the Goods Receiving Committee of the Three-Party Army. The list did not specify the quantity of scrap iron. When sold, the quantity was published in the newspaper based on the information from a confidential report. The quantity was recorded only after weighing after the auction. The Supervisory Yuan had investigated this matter and concluded that there was no suspicion of fraud. It was also stated that Ding Guitang was not responsible for handling this matter. The handling prosecutor will now conduct further investigations into the auction house in order to first clarify the exact quantity of scrap iron and then begin the investigation. Sun Zhuting, the original informant, also went to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, but Sun left when Qian and Han left. Sun also intended to additionally accuse Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong. The District Prosecutor's Office ordered him to submit a supplementary statement for review.</p>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>Debt Dispute</p>
<p>Chen Liang asks: I borrowed 300,000 counterfeit yuan from a friend in July of the previous year, promising to repay it within half a month, and used my check as collateral. Due to my business losses, I was unable to repay it on time. A month later, I raised 300,000 counterfeit yuan and first returned the principal, and begged to pay the interest later. Now my friend suddenly asks me to return 600,000 National Currency, saying that the 300,000 counterfeit yuan previously paid can only be used for interest. I would like to ask: (1) How should the current counterfeit yuan be converted into legal tender when repaid? (2) Should it be handled in accordance with Article 12 of the Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration? (3) If handled in accordance with Article 12, please provide the relevant provisions regarding my debt.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui's Answer] According to the law, payments made to repay debts are applied first to interest and then to principal. However, if the creditor agrees to receive the principal first, it can also have the effect of repaying the principal. Now the check issued by the debtor is still held by the creditor, so it is difficult to recognize that both parties agreed to repay the principal in the litigation. However, the loan and repayment are only more than a month apart, and the payment made by the debtor has reached nine-tenths of the loan amount. There is absolutely no such high interest rate. Even if there is no agreement to repay the principal first, it should be applied to repay the principal in addition to repaying the interest. The creditor's claim to apply all of it to interest is also inappropriate. As for lending 300,000 counterfeit yuan and wanting to receive 600,000 legal tender, why not ask him what the basis is? Now I will answer your three questions separately: (1) The conversion rate of counterfeit currency to legal currency is 200 to 1. (2) It is possible to apply Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration for the court to make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment. (3) The legal text of that article is: "If, after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to normal affairs, the situation changes, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should fairly measure it and make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment, or change other original effects." This article was seen in the Tai Lan on October 19, 35.</p>

<h3>Investigating Fire Files, Compiled and Submitted to the Mayor for Review Firefighters' Fingerprints Must Be Sent to the Police Station for Identification Today Secret Report Box to Be Opened Publicly the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The focus of the investigation into the Seymour Road fire case will now shift to the review of administrative justice and the formulation of prevention and remediation plans. On the administrative side, the Investigation Committee has submitted a portion of the organized files by Chairman Ge Kexin to Mayor Wu for review. Ge Kexin said: After reviewing the case files, the mayor expressed many feelings and will provide specific opinions. The police station has also sent the files related to the dereliction of duty and detention of personnel to the Municipal Government Secretariat for submission to Mayor Wu. On the judicial side, the five firefighters suspected of dereliction of duty who were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the Jiangning Road Police Station the day before yesterday were also interrogated by Prosecutor Zhang in court. The testimonies of the defendants were obviously evasive. Regarding prevention and remediation strategies, Zhang Da, the Chief of the Inspectorate of the Police Station, said: "The Investigation Committee plans to launch a general fire prevention inspection by citizens immediately. It is generally believed that the dilapidation of houses and the damage to fire-fighting equipment during the eight years of Shanghai's occupation were innate shortcomings that allowed the fire to spread. Therefore, it is imperative that each household conduct a detailed inspection of the electrical wires, stoves, and combustibles in their homes and make repairs." Ge Kexin also scheduled to visit various fire stations the day after tomorrow. He said: "Although we are laymen in fire-fighting work, a field visit may be of some help."</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Investigation Committee asked Lu Fengqian, a teacher at Seymour Road National Elementary School, at Cai Baoshang's residence. It was said that he did see a short, stout man gesticulating and talking about firefighters stealing at the back door of the school. The stout man said: "I personally saw a Chinese military policeman standing next to the fire because the firefighter's pockets were full. He punched him, and a small clock fell out. The military policeman kicked the firefighter again, and other things fell out." Although this statement was denied by military policeman Song Zhipeng the day before yesterday, Lu Fengqian said that he might be able to find this stout man nearby and verify it.</p>
<p>Today's Work</p>
<p>The investigative work that still needs to be carried out today is: (1) Order the firefighters who participated in the rescue work in Xizhou to complete the fingerprinting and send it to the identification section of the police station for inspection today, so that it can be known whether the fingerprints left on the wooden cabinet are related to the firefighters. (2) The mayor ordered Zhang Da to supervise the overturning of the fire site from today, and to carefully inspect the ashes that can be used as a reference. Zhang Da estimated that this work can be completed within three days.</p>
<p>Hoping for Secret Reports</p>
<p>In addition, the Investigation Committee strongly urges disaster victims and neighbors around the fire site to bravely submit information they have heard and seen by submitting letters to the secret report box in front of Shunchang South Goods Store on Seymour Road. In order to show impartiality, the Investigation Committee sealed a key to the secret report mailbox in an envelope yesterday, which was signed by each investigation committee member for safekeeping. The mailbox is scheduled to be opened publicly at 10:00 AM on the 6th.</p>

<h3>Five Firefighters Begin Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The five firefighters, Dai Guangrong, Shang Zhikui, Li Chengjun, Cai Zhiying, and Huang Shiqi, who were suspected in the Seymour Road fire case, were detained by the police station on the handwritten order of Mayor Wu, and were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office at 2:40 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, it was a weekly holiday, and the duty prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, Zhang Zhenyuan, briefly questioned the case and ordered them to be detained. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the handling prosecutor, Shen Zushou, formally opened the court for investigation. It was reported that the five firefighters all denied taking advantage of the fire to rob and claimed that they were not at the scene when the fire was spreading. They went to the fire scene on the second day of the Lunar New Year to take over the shift. As for taking towels, they claimed that others gave them to wipe the faucets. The court adjourned at 4:20 PM. The five firefighters are still being held in the detention center. Prosecutor Shen said that the five defendants did not admit to taking advantage of the fire to rob, which was expected. The Prosecutor's Office will do its best to investigate to get to the bottom of the matter. Another interrogation may be conducted today, but the current investigation process is not convenient to publish.</p>
<h3>Disaster Victim Carpenter Lu Cries to the Investigation Committee Cannot Endure Sleeping in the Open Demands Exemption from Demolishing Sheds</h3>
<p>Lu Shijun, a resident of No. 425 Wuding Road (the coppersmith shop where the fire started), a carpenter by trade, went to Cai Baoshang's residence yesterday to cry to the Fire Investigation Committee. After the fire, daily necessities such as houses, furniture, clothes, and quilts were all burned to ashes. Because there was no place to live, he built a shed on the fire damage to avoid the wind and rain. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works ordered him to demolish it within seven days because it violated administrative regulations. Lu said that the shed was built with the help of relatives and friends with sparse amounts of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Once forced to move, he will have nowhere to live, and his family will suffer from sleeping in the open. Therefore, he especially cried to the Investigation Committee, hoping that the authorities could understand their unfortunate situation and make special concessions.</p>
<p>Lu was also reluctant to reveal whether the firefighters had robbed, saying that he had personally seen firefighters fighting each other, one wanting to drag the faucet to the rubber factory to irrigate, and the other refusing to let go. As for other situations, because they were not witnessed, hearsay could not be used as evidence.</p>
<p>Lu reported that when he was rescuing sundries in the fire, he claimed that he rushed into the raging fire a total of four times. The first time he rescued a quilt, the second time he rescued a bicycle, the third time he rescued a rickshaw, and the fourth time he rescued a piece of salted pork. The chairman suddenly asked: "Did you rescue the diamond ring?" Lu was stunned and didn't know what to say for a moment. Because Disaster Victim Representative Wang Yunfu's Miss Wenying reported in public at the Atlantic Asian Vegetable Agency reception yesterday afternoon that she had rescued two 18-carat diamond rings, Ge was joking with Lu Shijun about this.</p>
<h3>An Old Uniform Worth Pondering</h3>
<p>Also, Yan Ze, a disaster victim at No. 27 Wuding Road, found a uniform in a pile of clothes the day after the fire. Yan suspected at the time that it was left by a firefighter after robbing his clothes. After being sent to the Investigation Committee and transferred to the Criminal Division of the Police Station for investigation, it was not a firefighter's uniform, but an old police uniform, which may have flowed to others through the hands of old goods stalls. However, since it was at the fire site, it must be related to the fire. The police station may not find it difficult to find out who is wearing it, because the old number is still attached to the clothes.</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out in Hair Salon's Loft Baby Burned to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] At about 12:15 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the New New Hair Salon at No. 108 Xinzha Road. Black smoke billowed, and the fire was very fierce. After the fire station reported it, it immediately ordered the pump troops to rush to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. It was estimated that a part of the three-story building was burned down, and a two-month-old baby was found burned to death. The cause of the fire was said to be a cooking fire.</p>
<p>At Huade Elementary School, No. 64 Xicang Road, Nanshi, a fire broke out carelessly at about 6:30 PM yesterday. Although snowflakes were falling, the flames were very fierce and did not abate. After the firefighters bravely rescued, it was extinguished until 7:30 PM. As a result, two and a half school buildings were burned down.</p>
<h3>Rear Area Restoration Factories Actively Resuming Work and Production</h3>

Such as Rixin Machinery, Datong Electric, Fuchang Chemical, Shanghai Weaving, Nanchang Chemical, Yaxing Copperware, Huaxin Asbestos, Dakura Tea, Weiwoo Electromagnetic, and Tiantong Chemical factories, most of which can resume production recently. In the midst of this industrial and commercial downturn, it is truly a new force in the national industry. In addition, the association's office has been moved to No. 400 Emei Road. Yesterday, a New Year's gathering was held at the new office.</p>
<h3>Zheng Meikui Most Likely to Be Elected Head of Putuo District</h3>
<p>The election for the head of Putuo District is scheduled to be held on February 5 at the district office. A total of eight people are participating in this election. Except for two who voluntarily withdrew, there are still six people competing. It is heard that in this election, Zheng Meikui, the former deputy district head, is most likely to win.</p>
<h3>Reporting Underground Money Shops 30% of Fines as Reward</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the case of the Social Affairs Bureau strictly investigating underground money shops on previous orders, the Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation on how to reward the whistleblower. Now the Ministry of Finance has sent a reply to the Municipal Government stating that: "Those who privately establish banks and operate banking businesses in violation of the Regulations on the Administration of Banks, Article 19, should be ordered by the Ministry of Finance to cease operations and be fined. Regarding rewarding informants, 30% of the fines can be awarded to the informants, subject to the Ministry of Finance's approval."</p>
<h3>Taikoo Puxi Wharf Workers' Dispute Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Shengjing Ship Overloads and Unloads Cargo</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Taikoo Company's Puxi Wharf warehouse workers have been fighting for work since the 26th of last month. The foreman Zhou Ruisun led more than 100 workers to the wharf warehouse to demand work. The current foreman Chen Shanyu's side refused to give in, resulting in a dispute. On the 1st of this month, the Shengjing ship arrived at the port and docked at Taikoo Puxi Wharf No. 3. At 4:00 PM, the hatches were opened to unload the cargo, and Zhou's workers waited at the wharf to fight for work. The two sides had another dispute. Later, the police brigade and military police arrived to suppress the situation, and it was calmed down. The ship also stopped unloading. The day before yesterday, the ship planned to unload again, but unexpectedly, the workers had a conflict, and the police fired shots, and they dispersed. As a result, both sides were injured, and the ship stopped unloading again. Yesterday, for the sake of the ship's schedule, the company changed the unloading method, using barges to unload in the outer stalls and load them into the Yangtiedu warehouse in Pudong. Both sides were helpless, and the conflict remained deadlocked.</p>
<h3>Unsatisfied with Five-Year Sentence Reduction Yu Xiangyan Petitions for Retrial Presents New Evidence Based on Two Points</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In the railway material corruption case in the Jinghu area, "Director's Wife" Yu Xiangyan was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment in the first instance by the District Court, which was later reduced to ten years by the High Court. Yu Xiangyan then hired lawyer Wang Boxian to petition the High Court for a retrial. Her petition cited Zhang Bokang's testimony in the first instance of the District Court, "In the material purchase comparison table, the director often did not approve it, and then Zhu Biwen and Zhang Kaiyuan, the clerks in our section, told me that I could communicate with the director's wife. Later, I went to the director's wife's place and found out that the wife wanted money. At that time, the section had already received a commission of 2.8 million, and I sent 1 million to Du Xiangyan." Based on the above testimony, lawyer Wang defended Yu on two points: (1) "Inciting the demand for bribes for official duties." The establishment of an incitement crime requires that the person has no criminal intent, and the determination arises from the instigation of the instigator. Even if Yu Xiangyan received 1 million yuan sent by Zhang Bokang, it was after Zhang Bokang received the commission, and it was not an incitement. At most, it is only a question of whether she knew about it and received stolen goods, not the question of inciting the demand for bribes for official duties. (2) Ding Shuhui's testimony is consistent with Zhang Bokang. The review court believes that Yu's testimony is no different from Ding's. In fact, in the first instance of the court, there was no discussion of commission distribution. All were spoken in Mandarin. And he claimed, "The court failed to consider such important evidence..." It is also heard that in addition to the above reasons for applying for a retrial, Yu Xiangyan has new evidence to present.</p>
<h3>Car Dealership Fires Drivers Labor-Management Dispute Arises</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Shunfeng Car Dealership laid off 22 drivers due to sluggish business. The severance pay issue has been negotiated repeatedly, and the labor side agreed to reduce it to 420,000. The capital side believes that those who have served for more than one year can be paid two months' severance pay (which is exactly 420,000), but two of the 22 drivers have not completed one year and also demanded the same payment, which the capital side refused to allow, and the labor side insisted, thus forming a deadlock.</p>

<h3>Young Girl Scolded, Contemplates Suicide Married Woman Swallows Ash After Spat</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Mao Lili, a 19-year-old girl living at No. 14, Lane 563, Dongdaming Road, Hongkou, had a slight rebuke from her father over family matters after dinner yesterday and became distraught and contemplated suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered early and sent to the hospital for treatment by her family.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Zhang Yao, a 42-year-old woman living at No. 1, Xingyeli, Catholic Church Street, whose husband works as a dock worker, borrowed more than 400,000 at high interest rates because business has been slow recently and it is difficult to make a living. She was unable to repay it on time, which caused her to be harassed by creditors. At 11:30 PM last night, the couple had a quarrel. Zhang felt resentment and secretly swallowed ash to commit suicide. After being noticed, she hired a car and sent it to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Disaster Victims of the Great Fire Host News Reporters, Hoping for Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment of Unlawful Firefighters, Landlord Orders Relocation, Appealing to the Press for Sanctions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of the victims of the fire at No. 660 Seymour Road, Wang Wenying (daughter of Wang Yunfu), Yan Ze, Zheng Zaijian, and Jin Zhengxueqing, hosted a press conference at the Atlantic Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday. They expressed their hope that the authorities would thoroughly investigate and severely punish firefighters for dereliction of duty and unlawful behavior. Furthermore, they appealed to the public for sanctions against the landlord of No. 660, who recently published a notice ordering all residents of the lane to relocate within ten days, disregarding the suffering of the disaster victims. Regarding the truth of the fire and the unlawful behavior of the firefighters, the representatives seemed hesitant to speak freely, only stating that they would await the investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office and the Investigation Committee. Miss Wang Wenying was relatively frank and outspoken, but when reporters asked if it was true that firefighters had extorted gold bars, she replied that she had only heard about it. The speeches of each person are recorded below:</p>
<p>If it Burned Completely, There Should be Traces</p>
<p>Yan Ze reported four points: (1) In this fire, the firefighters clearly did not make an effort to rescue, otherwise the entire lane would not have been burned down. He hoped the authorities would thoroughly investigate. (2) There is a strong suspicion that firefighters took the opportunity to rob during the fire, as it is a fact that the victims' property disappeared. At that time, there were many soldiers and police, and outsiders could not enter. If it burned completely, there should be traces. He hoped that firefighters who took the opportunity to rob would not be tolerated and should be severely punished according to the law. (3) The landlord of No. 660 has ulterior motives and recently published a notice ordering tenants to relocate within ten days. In addition to hiring a lawyer to negotiate with him, he hoped that society would jointly sanction him. (4) This fire can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Many victims have been displaced and are homeless. They should be compensated according to the law and should be given relief based on the situation. The Municipal Government has now organized an investigation committee to investigate. The truth will come out one day. Now, the victims have jointly elected Wang Yunfu, Jin Zhengxueqing, and himself as representatives. Please provide guidance at any time.</p>
<h3>Miss Wang Delivers an Impassioned Speech: Who Would Use a Gun to Shoot Me? The Bullet is Really Not Worth It</h3>
<p>Following Yan Ze, Wang Wenying, daughter of Wang Yunfu, reported, saying: "Compensation for fire losses should be given as a matter of course, but now the government is too poor, and in fact, businesses and industries do not have the money to do it well, so it is fundamentally impossible to compensate us, so we'll talk about it slowly. As for taking the opportunity to rob during this fire, there are several points that can prove it. First, the hose is the most important tool for firefighters. How could it be pressed underground? Clearly, they were doing something else. Second, how could a firefighter's uniform be found in someone else's home? Presumably, they grabbed the clothes and didn't want the uniform. Third, that day was the first day of the New Year. The firefighters probably didn't get tickets to the theater, so they intentionally watched the good show of the big fire. This show was watched for thirteen hours, and they had food and drink, enjoying themselves. Fourth, the fire was extinguished once, but then it reignited. What is the reason for this? Isn't it because the extortion was unsuccessful? My father and others are afraid of trouble, afraid that their lives and property will be completely destroyed, but I am not afraid. I am a woman. Who would use a gun to shoot me? That bullet is really not worth it. Our home has been burned down, but we shouldn't burn down our morality and personality. We should tell the truth. It is useful for society and for the country. Shanghai is like a dark and complex family. I am the little sister. You are all family members. We should manage this family well."</p>
<h3>Why Was the Water Released Before the Nozzle Was Installed? Who Led the Trial Department?</h3>
<p>Zheng Zaijian, residing at No. 27, raised three questions: (1) When the fire was about to be extinguished at the coppersmith's shop, why didn't the firefighters move the water pipe to the home of Wang Yunfu at No. 29 to reduce the heat? (2) When No. 29 was burning, why didn't the firefighters dismantle the tin roofs of neighboring houses such as No. 25 to avoid the spread of the fire? (3) At that time, when the firefighters were spraying water, the nozzle was not yet installed, and the water had already been released, making it impossible to connect the hose. Who was the leader? Did the fire chief come to the scene to direct?</p>
<p>Finally, Miss Wang Wenying stood up again to add information, and reporters asked questions. She said that the next day when she returned home to visit, there were no soldiers or police guarding the fire scene, and she heard a firefighter say: "The early shift was carefree, we are out of luck." Her family had at least sixty boxes, but the excavation of the fire scene yielded no traces. She had her own "private money," three large banknotes and ten small gold lockets, etc. The large banknotes were placed in the lower layer of the iron box and had disappeared. The gold lockets, etc., were still there. As for the total value of the family's losses, she had heard her father, Wang Yunfu, say that people don't believe that pig bristles are worth 2 billion yuan, but in fact, his life savings are three times this amount.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Rice Prices: In Addition to Selling Siam Rice as Much as Possible, White Rice is Also Sold at Negotiated Prices, Market Was Monitored Yesterday, and Formal Transactions Were Scarce</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The authorities have great confidence in suppressing the rising rice prices. Yesterday, a total of 16,080 bags of Saigon rice were sold, including 6,990 bags in the Nanshi market and 9,090 bags in the Beishi market. The price was still 63,000 yuan per stone. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu went to the Bank of China to meet with President Song to inquire about suppressing rice prices. It is reported that in addition to unlimited sales of Siam rice, the government will also sell Wuxi white rice in large quantities at negotiated prices starting today. Mayor Wu said that rice prices can be suppressed within one or two weeks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because the authorities sent personnel to monitor the market, white rice could not exceed 69,000 yuan per stone for the whole sale price and 76,000 yuan for the retail price, otherwise, they would be severely punished. Therefore, there were no transactions. There was some trading in the black market outside the market, and the prices were chaotic.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday that the rumor that the black market price of white rice had reached around 100,000 was not accurate. According to the report from the municipal government's investigation in various districts, the highest black market price of white rice yesterday was 88,000 yuan, and those dealers who exceeded the negotiated price will be severely punished. Mayor Wu also said that there is no need to worry about the source of foreign rice in the future, because according to the current storage volume, it can be maintained until the end of August. He hopes that citizens will eat more medium-grade rice, because medium-grade rice is both nutritious and cheaper.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Allowed to be Adjusted, Edible Oil Prices Not Allowed to Change Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu convened talks with people in the edible oil and flour industries yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was decided that the new negotiated price of edible oil would remain unchanged for two weeks. The new negotiated price of flour will be implemented from today.</p>
<p>The edible oil talks were held at 4:15 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Those present were Ji Mingzhai, Qiu Liangrong, Zhang Derun, Li Tingdong, Xie Yuxiang, Zhou Weibai, Zhang Chao, etc. On the oil pressing industry side, they requested the authorities to allocate soybeans at a flat price. Mayor Wu has agreed in principle, but the implementation details will be determined after consulting with President Song. However, the new negotiated price of edible oil shall not be changed for any reason within two weeks.</p>
<p>The flour talks were held at the same location at 4:30 PM. Those present were the Director of the Food Department, Rong Yiren, Xi Debing, Qian Shouchun, Wu Limen, Zhu Maoqiu, Zhang Chao, Gu Zhunian, etc. After discussion, it was decided to adjust the negotiated price of flour.

<h3>Oil Market Remains Tight, Soybeans Unavailable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market had very few arrivals, with only 260-270 stones in both the North and South markets. There were still no transactions in the market. Only Baiyuan and Yinyuan were slightly traded, and the prices rose sharply by 4,000-5,000 yuan. The Social Bureau has decided to allocate white rice to meet the actual sales of rice shops. Oil factories continued to supply the oil market as usual. Qing oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil did not rise or fall, while raw oil was actively digested, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan, and remained tight.

<h3>Quorum of Tea Price Appraisal Committee Not Reached, Meeting Adjourned</h3>

<h3>Tea Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market: sales negotiations were still lively, especially for green tea, such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which were more enthusiastic. However, because the holders were more determined and intensified their efforts to maintain prices, trading was not optimistic. In terms of prices, due to the relationship of the goods, there was no significant rise, but compared to last week, they all showed slight improvement.</p>

<h3>Buying Spree Intensifies, Gold Market Sees New High Prices, US Dollars Also Pulled Up by 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold prices soared as the Central Bank's supply was limited. The morning opened at 4.09 million with sales, and once rose from 4.06 million to 4.1 million. The Central Bank slightly supplied, but was blocked. Later, it hovered between 4.07 million and 4.09 million for a long time. The Central Bank allocated 1,200 bars at a price of 4.08 million. There was still a lack of honor or disgrace afterwards. It was not until after 11:00 that it gradually stabilized. When the price of 4.1 million was broken again at noon, a buying spree suddenly broke out. The Central Bank happened to have no supply, so it rose sharply. At noon, it jumped to a high price of 4.25 million, and then slightly stabilized. In the afternoon, the Central Bank had even fewer sources of supply for deferred delivery. Tianjin reported a sharp rise. For a time, the buying spree was in full swing. Gold shops announced the closing of the market after 4:00 PM. The new peak reached 4.45 million, resulting in a sharp increase of 340,000 compared to last Saturday. Gold jewelry was 445,000. Silver dollars rose slightly. Secret interest was between 15% and 18%.</p>
<p>There were no special characteristics for foreign currencies. The black market price of US dollars in the early morning was 7,500 to 7,700. At noon, it rose slightly to 7,900 following the gold market. In the afternoon, gold prices jumped sharply, and the price of US dollars also rose to a high price of 8,100, resulting in an increase of 400 yuan compared to last Saturday.

<h3>Entirely Relying on the Assistance of the Gold Market, Chinese Stocks Turned from Weak to Firm</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were stimulated by the gold market yesterday, turning from weak to firm. The morning opened slightly lower. After the opening, numbers 14 and 91 were accepted, and deferred delivery once rose slightly to 830 yuan. Number 16 tried to sell spot Yongsha, and numbers 224, 235, 89, 76, and 172 were also sold. The market situation gradually went downstream, but it mostly hovered because the gold price was still good. Number 156 supplied spot Yongsha fiercely, and the spot delivery fell to 803 yuan, while deferred delivery was still hovering at 818 yuan. After 11:00, the assistance of the gold market caused a buying spree. Numbers 89, 4, 35, and 99 all entered spot Yongsha, while numbers 224, 14, 108, and 171 entered deferred Yongsha. At noon, the spot delivery rose to 832 yuan, and the deferred delivery saw a high price of 842 yuan. Number 95 sold and then slightly stabilized. The result was that spot Yongsha was flat compared to last Saturday, while Huafeng, Qinxing, Xinguang, and Xinhe fell slightly. Meiya and Jingfu each fell by half a percent. The trading volume of cold stocks was still small, and the price continued to decline slightly. In the later market, the gold market was even more bullish. Numbers 83 and 204 came in, and deferred Yongsha was raised to 855 yuan. Numbers 84 and 231 sold high, and Number 76 also sold after entering, and it still showed a setback. Numbers 198, 152, 154, etc. all entered, and deferred Yongsha rose to 856 yuan. The spot delivery reached a high price of 847 yuan. Numbers 84, 199, 4, 89, 22, and 176 continued to supply, falling back to within 850 yuan. Xinya once reached the limit up. The gold market had only gains and no losses. Before the close, it presented a seesaw situation. The result was that spot Yongsha, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng rose slightly compared to last Saturday, while Meiya, Xinhe, and Jingfu fell slightly. The trading volume of cold stocks was sparse, with honor and disgrace intertwined. Deferred delivery of Yongsha, Huafeng, and Xinguang rose slightly, Xinhe fell slightly, Meiya had no transactions, and the stocks outside the market, such as Dasheng, continued to make progress.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were very peaceful yesterday, and the market price did not advance but slightly declined. The result was that steel stocks were flat compared to last Saturday, while the rest showed slight declines.</p>
<h3>The Market is Filled with Buying Voices, Coal Prices Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>The coal market for all types of bituminous coal was filled with buying voices. Sellers shouted prices higher and higher, especially for lump coal, which was even tighter. Baimei Jiaozuo lump coal has not arrived since the New Year because it was heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs was taking over. The current market price has been shouted up to 950,000 with no goods. Zahuangji lump (ie, Xinhongji lump) also needs 900,000 yuan. Qinghongji lump (ie, Laohongji lump) is shouted at 1 million yuan, still short. Other low-grade white coal lumps, such as Baoqing, Fengjie, and Laolong, were transported in small amounts, with trading prices between 760,000 and 800,000 yuan, and the transaction volume was quite active.</p>
<h3>Costs of Raw Materials and Labor Increase, Cotton Cloth Prices Also Adjusted, Rising by 10% to 16% Compared to Previous Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the recent rise in cloth prices, the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee convened an extraordinary meeting at the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon. Those present were Pan Shihao of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, Yan Guangdi of the Six-District Cotton Textile Association, Dong Jiufeng of the Cotton Cloth Association, Wu Shufang and Chen Jiazhen of the Textile Construction Company, Liu Jingji of the Municipal Council, and Liu Wenteng of the Textile Management Committee. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration of the Social Bureau, served as the chairman. Because the allocated price of cotton yarn for textile construction has already risen by about 16%, and other wages have also been higher than before, it was decided to adjust the negotiated price, which will be implemented from today:</p>
<p>(1) The factory wholesale price of 12-pound white fine cloth is adjusted from 102,000 to 118,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 114,000 to 132,000. An increase of 16%.</p>
<p>(2) The factory wholesale price of 12-pound white twill is adjusted from 98,000 to 107,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 109,000 to 119,000. An increase of 10%.</p>
<p>(3) The factory wholesale price of 9-pound raw color drill is adjusted from 122,000 to 134,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 136,000 to 150,000. An increase of 10%.</p>
<p>(4) The factory wholesale price of 12-pound raw color fine cloth is adjusted from 140,000 to 162,000. The wholesale price is adjusted from 156,000 to 180,000. An increase of 16%.</p>
<p>The Review Committee also believes that since the Textile Management Committee has abolished the price limit control on cotton yarn, and the allocation of yarn by the Textile Construction Company also fluctuates with the market, it is believed that to control prices, it is necessary to control materials. To stabilize cotton cloth prices in the city, it seems that the material management agency should make appropriate arrangements in accordance with the country's economic policy. This point is submitted to the Municipal Government for referral to the Textile Management Committee for verification.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, because the Textile Construction Company sold a small amount to the cloth shops, the manufacturers were waiting to see, and the door shops were selling very smoothly. The customer groups were also strongly searching, causing the market to rise. The price of Longtou fine cloth rose sharply by 5,000 yuan per piece. The price of AAA color balls rose by 9,500 yuan, and the price of Wufu was shouted up to 125,000 yuan. The price of dark blue Shilin cloth also rose accordingly. However, the spot price of Luohan Tu Shilin cloth was flooded, and the price fell instead. The rest of the cloths were firm.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Opened Yarn Sales as Usual, Applicants Were Very Active, Opening a Total of More Than 4,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the China Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual yesterday due to the fluctuating yarn prices in recent days, the applicants were twice as crowded, with a total of more than 4,000 pieces. As a result, 1,718 pieces were allocated to manufacturers and 670 pieces were allocated to yarn shops, for a total of 2,388 pieces. The number of applying households was 988 for manufacturers and 670 for yarn shops. In terms of allocation, large manufacturers were mostly allocated as planned, while small factories and yarn shops were slightly reduced. The selling price of each yarn count has increased by 16% compared to the previous price. However, it is still about 10% lower than yesterday's market price.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Stimulate People's Hearts, Yarn Market Initially Weak, Then Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market initially declined and then strengthened. In the early morning, because many bulls in the industry took profits, the price was lower than last Saturday by 50,000-70,000. Then, because the gold price was reported higher, new buyers took advantage of the cheap price to absorb the market, and the price gradually rose. The initial price of heavy-weight Shuangma was 3,035,000, and the final transaction price was 3,100,000. Ordinary 20-count yarn was particularly firm, with a price about 20,000-30,000 yuan higher than last week. The flower prices rose repeatedly, and people's hearts were still high. The future is very promising.</p>
<h3>Information on Yongli Bank</h3>

<h3>Coal Transport Ship</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchant Ship Lease Expires, Fuel Management Committee Changes to Leasing Domestic Vessels</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The lease term of 150,000 tons of coal transport ships leased by the Fuel Management Committee from foreign merchants will expire at the end of this month because the government has opened the navigation period for foreign ocean vessels. It has been decided to gradually return the leases and lease domestic vessels as much as possible. The longest lease term for foreign vessels leased by the committee will expire around the end of June of this year. At that time, if the actual situation permits, all foreign vessels can be returned and replaced by all leased domestic vessels. As of now, the committee has leased one vessel from Shou Kang Company, the "Tian [blank]" (about 10,000 tons), and one vessel from Zhongxing Company, the "Fuxing" (about 7,000 tons), to participate in coal transport work at various ports. The committee's coal transport volume in January was still 110,000-120,000 tons. The coal production volume in the current coal-producing areas has not decreased, but the transportation capacity is uncertain. The monthly coal consumption in this city is about 160,000 tons. The current transport volume is about 60%-70% of the required volume. Fortunately, the coal storage volume in this city is often maintained at around 100,000 tons, so it can still regulate the needs of various sectors.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Rise Endlessly, Cigarettes Show Slight Retreat</h3>
<p>The market situation for cigarettes and candles continued to be firm and excellent yesterday. The prices of all grades of goods have been made to unprecedented new highs. Among them, soap prices rose more sharply. The price of Guben was 157,000 yuan per box, and the price of Arrow Knife was 156,700 yuan. Except for the price of 100 pieces of Huang Xiangmao which was fixed, the rest all saw new prices. The prices of high-quality matches continued to rise, while the prices of lower-quality matches turned flat. Cigarettes have risen to their peak. The appetite of customer shops has turned sluggish. Holders are willing to sell at the market price, and the market situation has slightly retreated.</p>
<h3>Factory Silk and Satin Rise Sharply, Rayon Shows Slight Retreat</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau did not allocate rayon to the silk industry this week because the industry has not yet submitted the total number of application forms required. It is reported that the allocation price of rayon will not change recently.</p>
<p>The market price of factory silk rose by 100,000 yuan for all grades because the gold price rose and people's hearts were invigorated. Rayon rose too much over the weekend, so it showed a slight retreat yesterday. The silk satin market saw a sharp rise as soon as it opened in the morning. The factories took the opportunity to sell high, and the market situation softened slightly. Meiya bedspread was 3.2 million, and Dacheng had transactions at 3.05 million.</p>
<h3>Bystander's Perspective: If Production Exchange Rates Are Not Rectified, Export Markets May Be Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Observations by American Businessman Mr. Harvey</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Mr. Harvey, Far East Manager of Macy's Corporation in New York, also representing several department stores, spent two months in Shanghai, visiting various factories, but achieved nothing. He stated that if the Chinese financial authorities do not take strict measures within two months, they will lose the opportunity, and export markets, which are the main source of their foreign exchange, may be completely destroyed. In reality, China has already lost the chance, and its export hopes, except for a few items like tung oil, will be close to zero. Markets for manufactured goods, which were largely supplied by China before the war, have been completely seized by other countries. Puerto Rico, Mexico, India, Switzerland, and Italy are now selling Chinese-style products in the United States, with prices only one-third of those in China. Porcelain, which had a large export volume before the war, is now being produced in California. Pottery is also being imported into the United States from Mexico. Coarse cloth and carpets, which were traditionally supplied by the country, are now being exported by Puerto Rico. India is also manufacturing Chinese-style carpets. As for lace, embroidery, and matting, their sales in the United States will also be replaced by Switzerland and Italy. The main obstacles to restoring Chinese exports are high labor and material costs, lack of transportation, and unrealistic legal exchange rates. The official exchange rate for US dollars is 3,350 yuan, while the black market rate is around 7,700 yuan. The market price of various manufactured goods in Shanghai, calculated in US dollars, is ten times higher than before the war. Although American importers are willing to accept prices two to three times higher than before the war, it is difficult to expect transactions above ten times. Moreover, the current price fluctuations are too large, making business even more difficult. The market price of hemp cloth has risen by 40% in a week, while the exchange rate has hardly changed. The difficulties faced by American merchants in Shanghai are truly shocking. Packaging costs may even be more expensive than the goods themselves. The lack of interest from producers also leaves American merchants helpless. Many buyers, due to the uncertainty of when the situation will improve, are unwilling to wait here for long and have already packed their bags to return home. Only a few remain here, hoping that the authorities will find a way to remedy the situation within two months to salvage it. Currently, the main victim is still China. Although the American public lacks Chinese goods, they can easily find them in other markets. American merchants are still paying attention to Chinese goods and are willing to buy them here, but the prices must be reasonable, and there must be a supply of goods.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Prices Skyrocket; Road Leather, Aluminum, and Tin Are All Profitable</h3>
<p>The market price of tinplate continues to rise. No. 26 large tinplate has surged by 2.5 million yuan, reaching 7.5 million yuan per box. No. 24 iron is still in short supply, with reports of asking prices reaching 900,000 yuan per sheet. Small tinplate has also jumped by 50,000 yuan per box. Packing rope for strapping has also suddenly risen in price after the Spring Festival, with the price per ton exceeding the price at the end of last year by 1.5 million yuan. All these goods are in short supply due to scarce arrivals, and inventories are decreasing daily. Those holding inventory are unwilling to sell because they cannot replenish, so they are asking for high prices.</p>
<p>The lead and tin market, since the opening after the Lunar New Year, still shows a tight situation with high asking prices. Those holding goods are unwilling to let go, resulting in few transactions. Although the market situation for other copper products is still stable, it is said that arrivals are still extremely scarce.</p>

<h3>Basketball League: Renyu Defeats Encas, V Team Wins over Jiashen, Xuebai Wins over Li Team; Tonight, Hualian Plays All Blacks</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Three games of the basketball league were held at the City Gymnasium yesterday. Although it was snowing heavily and the weather was cold, hundreds of spectators still attended. As a result, in the women's group, Xuebai defeated the Li team 57-14, in the Group B2, V team defeated Jiashen 41-34, and in Group B1, Renyu defeated Encas 32-22. A brief account of the battles is as follows:</p>
<p>Women's Match</p>
<p>In the first women's match between Xuebai and the Li team, Weng Xiaoyun of the Li team opened the scoring with a free throw. In the first quarter, Xuebai led 9-3, and ended the first half with 20-10. After the change of ends, Xuebai had even more freedom to play, ending the third quarter with 42-16. In the last quarter, Wang Xiu of Xuebai fouled out five times and was replaced by Qian Mengyue. But the battle was still one-sided. In conclusion, the Li team suffered a crushing defeat with 14 points to Xuebai's 57.</p>
<p>Second Match</p>
<p>In the second match, V team met Jiashen. Zhuang Yikai of V team scored first, but Tao Yingshi of Jiashen returned the favor, and Sun Moxi added another assist, giving Jiashen the lead. Wang Nianci of V team made a shot and a free throw, and the Yi Rong and Yi Kai brothers added icing on the cake, while Zhu Mingxing skillfully shot the ball into the bullseye, 12-8, and V team took the lead. Jiashen called a timeout, which proved effective. Moxi and Yingshi controlled the whole game, 14-13, and Jiashen took the lead again by one point. The first half ended with a tie of 16 points each. After the change of ends, Hou Yongkang of Jiashen tossed the ball under the basket, Tao Yingshi made several consecutive hollow shots, and Sun Moxi scored another two points. V team only scored two points through Zhuang Yikai, 27-20, and V team was behind. So they made major adjustments to the lineup, which proved effective. Zhu Mingxing was promoted three levels in a row, and Zhuang Yikai added flowers with a long shot, 31-29, taking the lead again. The battle between the two sides was extremely tense. At the sound of the buzzer, Jiashen lost 34-41.</p>
<p>Main Attraction</p>
<p>In the main attraction, Renyu and Encas took to the stage. Encas had been defeated by Renyu in a charity match. Yesterday, they fought very hard. Wang Huaiting of Renyu threw a hollow shot from the center line, setting the record. Kai Luosiji of Encas returned the favor. Huaiting hit from the sides, and Wu Xinyun and Yao Wenhua assisted in the tyranny, giving Renyu the lead. Baolai, a tall player from Encas, tossed a ball under the basket, and Wu Xinyun returned the favor. Renyu called a timeout, and Wu Xinyun launched another attack. Yao Wenyi skillfully scored, 28-15, and Renyu was still far ahead. Encas replaced Fleck with Kebeng Qigu, which did not help the situation. With the last four minutes remaining, the score was 31-21. The battle was fierce, and the intensity only increased. Ao Chailiao of the foreign team and Wang Huaiting of Renyu both fouled out five times. The game also ended, with Renyu defeating Encas 32-22.</p>
<h3>Three Basketball Games Tonight: Hualian Plays All Blacks</h3>
<p>Three basketball league games will be held today starting at 5:30 pm at the City Gymnasium. Tickets are 2,000 yuan upstairs and 3,000 yuan downstairs.</p>

The main attraction was originally the Group A1 Renyu vs. Hailuqing, but Hailuqing has not returned from their expedition to Guam, so the match has been changed to a make-up game between Hualian and All Blacks. Hualian are all veterans of the battlefield, but Wu Chengzhang has not recovered from his illness and will probably have difficulty playing today. All Blacks have not been in good form recently, and the situation is likely to be dire. The schedule is listed below:</p>

<h3>Crossing North America in Five Days and Nights, Ten Thousand Miles (3)</h3>
<p>— Ma Shuqing, Sent from San Francisco</p>
<p>A Special Correspondent in America's View: Chinatown, San Francisco</p>
<p>A Dwelling Like a Large-Scale Museum: The Best Chinatown in the World</p>
<p>January 18th Airmail</p>
<p>San Francisco’s Chinatown is the best Chinatown in the world. At least, from my travels in Europe and America, I have come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>The Chinatown in Calcutta is the dirtiest. During British rule in India, it was often considered a source of infectious diseases. The Calcutta municipal government often restricted white people from entering Chinatown in the summer. When American troops were stationed in Calcutta, the military forbade soldiers from eating or drinking casually in Chinatown. In the summer, many streets and alleys in Chinatown were truly filled with foul odors.</p>
<p>Later, traveling through Europe, I saw that the Chinatown near the "Gare de Lyon" in Paris was not clean and tidy enough. The Chinese community in Berlin, although relatively clean, was too small and did not even have the specific designation of "Chinatown." The Chinatown in Hamburg, located on Schmuckstrasse, left me with the impression that many Chinese families lived in "cellars" (underground levels lower than the road). The Chinatown in London’s East End, a base for Chinese sailors, also seemed scattered and disorganized.</p>
<p>After arriving in the United States, I visited the Chinatowns in New York and Chicago. New York's was not only dirty but also reeked of "dried fish stench." Unpaved Chinatown streets were filled with the sound of heavy trucks all day long. New York tour companies, skilled at doing business, create beautiful verbal "advertisements" for New York's Chinatown, but in reality, this often "disappoints" tourists. As for the reactions of tourists after seeing New York’s Chinatown, and what they think of the Chinese people as a result, that is another matter.</p>
<p>I only visited Chicago’s Chinatown twice. I greatly admired the palace-style building initiated by Mr. Mei Youzhuo and others: the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association. It is magnificent, elegant, and can represent a part of Chinese culture. However, only when I stepped into San Francisco this time did I discover the culmination of Chinatown.</p>
<p>First Impression: Like a Museum</p>
<p>My first impression of San Francisco’s Chinatown was: It is like a large-scale Chinese museum. The entire Grant Avenue, except for a small section at each end that is not considered part of Chinatown, is entirely filled with "Chinese-centric" storefronts. Large gold-lettered signs in both Chinese and English, and dazzling neon lights at night, give visitors a fresh feeling. Chinatown has a lot of Chinese antique stores, called Art Stores in English. These antique stores contain cultural relics and utensils from various dynasties in China. An old man named Zeng, who has lived in Chinatown for a long time and is knowledgeable about antiques, told me: There are many treasures from the Han and Tang dynasties in Chinatown, but items from the Shang and Zhou dynasties are very rare.</p>
<p>Because I am an "outsider," I cannot distinguish between fakes and priceless national treasures. I believe that many Americans who are interested in oriental antiques – the old men and women who often linger and admire in front of shop windows – are simply looking out of "curiosity." Clever antique merchants display statues of Guanyin (Goddess of Mercy), embroidered skirts from the Qing Dynasty, and even ancestral portraits used for worship before the introduction of "photography" to China, in glass cabinets, allowing Westerners with completely different customs and habits to appreciate and marvel at them little by little.</p>
<p>Chinese Restaurants: Good Cooking, Fair Prices</p>
<p>Besides the dozens of antique stores, the most common are Chinese restaurants. The largest include "Far East Cafe," "Great China," and "Shanghai Low," among others. Chinese restaurants in San Francisco not only cook well but also offer fairer prices than elsewhere. Their cooking is mostly Cantonese-style, but with a touch of "sweet and sour" flavor from Jiangnan and Zhejiang. According to friends in San Francisco, the restaurant business was extremely good before the end of the war due to social unrest, but it has declined significantly this year.</p>
<p>Based on my rough observations, Chinese restaurants in San Francisco are indeed not as busy as those in New York. New York has a larger population and more Chinese students. Many Columbia University students eat two meals a day in Chinese restaurants. Although San Francisco also has Chinese students, they mostly live across the river in Berkeley. The "Chinese" who live here mostly cook at home for economic reasons. In addition, with so many restaurants, the business volume is quite dispersed, and the chances of being "fully occupied" are rare. Therefore, many restaurants in Chinatown pay considerable attention to Western customers, earning more money from "chop suey" and "chow mein" than from elaborately prepared Chinese dishes.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Trading Companies: Focused on Hong Kong</h3>
<p>San Francisco has more than sixty import and export trading companies, most of which are located in or near Chinatown. Mr. Zheng Bingshun's "Yu An Company," led by Mr. Zheng Bingshun, a leader of the Chinese community in San Francisco, is the most authoritative. According to Mr. Zou, there were only twenty or so companies engaged in import and export trade in San Francisco before the war, and now there are considerably more. Among the current sixty or so, most are operated by people from Guangdong, so the import and export targets are naturally concentrated in Hong Kong. The same is true for Chinese remittances. Mr. Zheng sincerely said, "This issue is worth paying attention to. The abnormal existence of Hong Kong’s sovereignty has a great impact on China’s economic construction!"</p>
<p>On the day Mr. Zou Bingshun invited me to "afternoon tea," Mr. Mei Youzhuo happened to have come to San Francisco from Chicago. Mei’s visit was to discuss the issue of organizing the Guangzhou Public Bus Company. It is said that the purchase of public buses is currently very difficult. If the public bus company were to open, Guangzhou would need at least three hundred buses, but American car merchants are unwilling to deliver three hundred cars on the same day. This is a practical difficulty in an era of production disconnection.</p>
<p>That day, we discussed many practical problems in the economic and educational aspects of the American Chinese community. Also present were Mr. Chen Liren, the Secretary-General of the Canadian branch of the Kuomintang, and Mr. You Yongzeng, a community leader in San Francisco, among others. After hearing many concrete facts, I felt that there were indeed many hidden worries in the Chinese community:</p>
<p>Out of 20,000 Overseas Chinese, 2,000 "Return to China"</p>
<p>The history of the Chinese community in America is only about a hundred years old. The first Chinese set foot on the New World of America, and the first place they encountered was San Francisco. In the decades before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese relied on labor and their habit of diligence and thrift, building their livelihoods from scratch. This continued until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the war years, and even during the years when China and the United States fought side by side, it was the golden age of the American Chinese. Chinese laborers had high-paying jobs, and Chinese restaurants and shops made a small fortune. However, once the abnormal prosperity of the war ended, the situation changed significantly.</p>
<p>Many Chinese missed their homeland, of course, their parents, wives, and children were there. In the past year or so, among the more than 20,000 Chinese in San Francisco, more than 2,000 have already "returned to China." The total number of overseas Chinese who have already returned to China and are preparing to return from the United States and Canada is about 20,000. However, the younger generation from China does not have the opportunity to come out. Immigration laws limit the number of Chinese immigrants to one hundred and five per year. "Even if one hundred and five people come every year, the future of the Chinese community is still bleak!"</p>
<p>Difficulties in Chinese Education Form a Serious Problem</p>
<p>Chinese education is also a problem that cannot be solved no matter how hard one thinks about it. Currently, there are nine overseas Chinese schools in Chinatown, San Francisco, that also run primary and secondary schools. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association runs the Chinese High School; the Kuomintang Party Headquarters runs the Jianguo Middle School; the local associations run the Yanghe School, the Nanchiao School, and the Confucius School; and the churches run the St. Peter's School, St. Mary's School, Concord School, and Gimbalen School. There used to be a Baptist School, which closed several years ago. The common difficulties faced by these schools are the problem of teaching time, the problem of teachers, and the problem of textbooks.</p>
<p>All children of overseas Chinese born within the territory of the United States are citizens of the United States. American law has the right to compel American citizens to receive American education. Therefore, according to law, children of overseas Chinese should receive American education. Chinese language instruction in overseas Chinese schools only occupies an ancillary position. Therefore, class time is mostly in the afternoon or evening, and students use tired minds to receive tutoring education, so the efficiency is naturally not high. In addition, there is a lack of teachers, and the teachers are all poorly paid. Due to the lack of excellent and suitably graded teaching materials, many overseas Chinese children still cannot recognize a few Chinese characters after studying for several years.</p>
<p>The Generation of Overseas Chinese Students is Heading Towards "Americanization"</p>
<p>In any case, the younger generation of overseas Chinese students is slowly drifting away from the Chinese community. Their environment and education are making them more and more "Americanized" every day. Mr. Liu Boji of the National Daily said very bluntly: "Stop hoping that they will return to China to serve!" Deputy Consul Wu Qianghua, one day, talking about the marital situation of overseas Chinese in Chinatown, said: Diligent young overseas Chinese are unwilling to marry overseas Chinese girls because these girls have all learned "Americanization," and even learned the American women's way of divorce!</p>
<p>Many people worry about the future of the young overseas Chinese seedlings. They say: These little overseas Chinese have learned the smooth talk of Americans, but have not learned the courage, diligence, and ambition of Americans.</p>
<p>However, some people feel that it is not pessimistic. Mr. You Yongzeng, one of the community leaders, said: If Chinese cultural groups can pay attention to this issue, and use the methods and spirit of foreign missionaries running schools in China to run overseas Chinese education here, it can still be effective. He believes that it is very inappropriate for the government to manage overseas Chinese education, as it will arouse the dissatisfaction of the American authorities.</p>
<h3>The Closure of the Chinese Aircraft Factory Reflects the Crisis in the Economic Lifeline of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The urgent matter lurking in Chinatown today is probably not education but economics. The American Chinese community has never had the large capitalists like those in Southeast Asia. Although the general material life of the American Chinese is better than in other places, their economic lifeline is still passively dependent on American economic institutions. During the war years, the entire American economy was abnormally prosperous, and the Chinese community also benefited a little. However, once the war ended, many Chinese laborers lost their well-paid jobs. The "Chinese Aircraft Factory" led by Zheng Bingshun, which was funded by the Chinese community and manufactured aircraft bodies for the American military, opened in 1944 and is currently in the process of closing down. Originally, there were five hundred workers, three-quarters of whom were Chinese laborers, and now they have all been laid off separately. I heard from the people in charge of the factory that they originally hoped that the Chinese government would help or take over, but the Chinese government did not have that much money. Later, they once changed to manufacturing radio receivers, but because competition was fierce and there was no room for profit, they finally decided to close down.</p>
<p>The aircraft factory is just one example of the economic situation of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>"Overseas Chinese are lovable!" For three years, I have traveled to every corner of Chinatown in Europe and America, and I always have the same feeling. On my second day in San Francisco, Consul General Zhang Zichang told me many stories of overseas Chinese eagerly donating. Then, he said: "More than ten years ago, when I first became a diplomat, I disliked Chinatown when I saw it. But now, I have changed my mind, I have become a loyal lover of Chinatown, I love everything about Chinatown!" (At the Washington Hotel in San Francisco)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Change the Lunar New Year to Farmers' Day</h3>
<p>— Dong Shijin</p>
<p>The current Farmers' Day is based on the recommendation of the National Agricultural and Forestry Administration Conference held in March of the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941]. It was originally set as February 5th and later changed to the Day of the Beginning of Spring. Although it has been promoted for several years, it has ultimately failed to interest the general farmers. I believe that if Farmers' Day is to be followed willingly by the general farmers, it must suit rural customs and meet the farmers' mentality. Therefore, I propose to use existing festivals, change their names, and not set up separate regulations. Among the various existing festivals, the Lunar New Year is the most appropriate. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Suitable for Folk Customs: The custom of celebrating the Lunar New Year is still widely followed among the people and cannot be eliminated, nor is it necessary to eliminate it. If it is changed to Farmers' Day, there is no need for government promotion. Naturally, it will become a habit and be celebrated grandly. However, some people may dislike the fact that the date cannot be fixed on the calendar. In fact, this is not a problem at all. The current Farmers' Day already has no fixed date, and there are many similar precedents in European and American countries. Easter is the first Sunday after the full moon following the spring equinox, and Thanksgiving in the United States is the last Thursday in November. Their dates are different every year.</p>
<p>(2) Contains Profound Meaning: The custom of celebrating the Lunar New Year not only does no harm but also has the beautiful intention of thanking nature and ancestors, which is spiritually consistent with Christmas and Thanksgiving in Europe and America. Therefore, the first important thing during the New Year is to offer sacrifices and thank Heaven, Earth, and ancestors, with sincerity and reverence that surpasses other festivals. Secondly, it is a time of rest and entertainment after the agricultural harvest and before the start of spring plowing, which is also essential for farmers who work hard all year round.</p>
<p>(3) Shows Sharing Joy with the People: The general public often feels that government measures often fail to consider folk customs. Taking the New Year as an example, although strict prohibitions have not been imposed in recent years, government agencies must continue to work as usual, and schools are not allowed to take holidays. This not only shows that the government is disconnected from the people but also leads to the malpractice of perfunctory hypocrisy. In fact, the government has not done its job well, the classes are not well taught, and at the same time, people cannot enjoy themselves to the fullest. It can be said that one move results in several losses. However, since the Lunar calendar has been abolished, it is not necessary to continue using the name of New Year. But if this day is designated as Farmers' Day, then national agencies and the people can celebrate together and enjoy themselves together.</p>
<p>(4) Preserves National Customs: Every nation has its own special customs and habits. These customs and habits are a part of the nation's history and culture, which must be preserved and promoted. However, in the past decade, when learning from Europe and the United States, some people in our country have often abandoned the common historical culture and harmless customs and habits. This not only destroys the characteristics of the nation but also is a loss to the world's culture. Now, if the Lunar New Year is designated as Farmers' Day, it will not conflict with the calendar system, and the most ancient and universally observed customs of our nation can also be preserved.</p>
<p>(5) Shows Respect for Agriculture: When we talk about respecting agriculture, we definitely do not mean to despise industry. Today, the Chinese people seem to unanimously agree that the development of Chinese industry must be based on agriculture. Therefore, valuing agriculture is tantamount to valuing the foundation of industry. In any case, China is still an agricultural country. Agriculture is China's most important industry, and farmers are the largest part of the Chinese people, as well as the most hardworking producers. This situation cannot be fundamentally changed in a short period of time. Now, if the most solemn festival in the nation's history is designated as Farmers' Day, it can express the state's profound intention of respecting agriculture and rewarding farmers.</p>
<p>We propose this date not to add another festival in addition to the New Year, but to simply give it a different name. As for the methods of celebrating this festival, all kinds of old customs can be followed, with solemnity, reverence, and joyful celebrations as the main focus, rather than holding other ceremonies and gatherings. However, at this time, the general public has more leisure time. After the main festival, various recreational activities and exhibitions can all be held in addition.</p>

<p>Women and Family Published Every Tuesday</p>
<h3>My Family's Economy</h3>
<p>— Chen Youjing</p>
<p>Every couple ultimately hopes for a happy family life and wants to increase family happiness. However, the only major obstacle to family happiness is economic problems. Economic shortcomings can lead to the breakdown of marital affection and even the pain of "divorce!" Therefore, I would like to put forward a few suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Management: That is to say, it must have the following three conditions: 1. Live within your means, 2. Balance income and expenditure, 3. Appropriate financial management. Living within your means means that couples should base their daily household expenses on their own economic income. Balancing income and expenditure means making accurate budgets so that income and expenditure are suitable. Appropriate financial management means that on the one hand, it is necessary to take into account the minimum living standard, and on the other hand, it is necessary to plan for unexpected expenses. If management is appropriate, there will be no overspending, no possibility of debt, and no worry about digging a well only when thirsty. If the husband's income is low, it can be steadily overcome, otherwise, even if the income is high, it may be stretched thin. This is because of the reasonability or unreasonability of the plan.</p>
<p>(2) Increase Revenue: If the couple is not disabled and has the ability to produce, it is best not to "sit idle and consume resources." They should seek a suitable occupation and engage in family side business. On the one hand, it can supplement household expenses, and on the other hand, it can promote wealth. With economic affluence, the emotional bond between couples will naturally increase.</p>
<p>(3) Cooperation: First of all, it should be noted that there must be no selfishness between husband and wife. Both parties should understand each other's economic situation so as not to increase the economic burden. Sincere and frank cooperation can resolve economic difficulties. Couples have an obligation to the economy. One party cannot indulge in pleasure and spend arbitrarily, while the other party suffers hard and counts every penny, creating an imbalance of happiness and hardship. On the contrary, it cannot compensate for economic leaks and losses. If there is surplus income, it should be saved up to prepare for emergencies. If you encounter unemployment, you can also reduce the burden and not worry. If you want to reach the point where everyone eats when there is food and everyone uses when there is money, then opening up the finances will naturally provide a solution.</p>
<p>(4) Thrift: Labor prevents starvation, and frugality prevents greed. The most important thing in a family is thrift. How can we be thrifty? 1. Within the scope of not hindering work, it is best to operate yourself and not hire servants. On the one hand, you can save money and avoid being annoyed and the harm of skimming oil; on the other hand, you can increase experience in cooking and sewing and not rely on others. 2. Make an effort to eliminate unnecessary socializing, improper entertainment, and bad habits, because these can deplete the economy and even cause crime as a result of economic panic. 3. In the event of major events such as weddings and funerals, you should carefully consider your economic capacity, and try to save as much as possible under the principle of thrift, and don’t try to save face.</p>
<p>(5) Correct: A couple's love must not contain vanity or be tempted by money. They must have a spirit of sharing weal and woe. Because once there is vanity, it will create a luxurious lifestyle, wasting money. When the other party is earning money, they will not cherish it, and once there is no income, they will inevitably discriminate, resulting in discord between the couple, turning into a marriage of "firewood and rice." One must recognize clearly that hard-earned money is not easy to come by. Cherishing money is protecting the other party.</p>
<p>We must know that a reasonable family economy can maintain family happiness and can promote a fulfilling life for the couple. Therefore, couples should thoroughly pay attention to this important family issue! (Gratitude)</p>
<h3>The Complete Laws of the New Family</h3>
<p>— Anna</p>
<p>No matter where you live, big or small, you must have your own family.</p>
<p>Never grumble and say annoying things before eating, and avoid doing so after meals.</p>
<p>Often avoid endless quarrels and incessant debates. In fact, the things you're fighting over are not worth making a fuss about.</p>
<p>Always compromise with each other. This is the best "antidote" to divorce.</p>
<p>Real sympathy and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Respect each other's elders and friends.</p>
<p>Treat the construction of your family as a religious belief in God. Always treat your partner with a spirit of forgiveness, and you will feel the happiness of a fulfilling family.</p>
<p>Have you followed the above?</p>
<h3>How to Correct Stuttering</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Usually, the speech organs of a three- or four-year-old child are mostly unable to manipulate smoothly. There are a few words that they have difficulty expressing, and there are a few sounds that they often cannot pronounce correctly. Sometimes these words cause them to hesitate and develop a stutter.</p>
<p>If this happens, do not immediately train them with the correct sound or continuously. Saying it to them once is enough. Don’t try to teach phonetics to such a three- or four-year-old child. There is no need to train them in any way of speaking. You should focus your attention on the sounds of words that are easy to cause stuttering. This stutter is often easily confused with a serious speech defect, causing some avoidable troubles.</p>
<p>Children are prone to stuttering when they begin to speak continuous sentences. When this happens, watch your eyes, do not look at the child's face, and show that you are busy with something else, although you are secretly listening to them.</p>
<p>Stuttering is because the part of the child's mouth used for speaking uses too much force, thus stopping them. If he can have time to adjust, he will repeat it, saying what he wants to say slower and clearer than before. It is useless to ask him to stop and correct the pronunciation of that word. He is trying to express an idea in his mind. When that idea is stopped because you correct his pronunciation, the tongue resistance increases, only making the stutter more serious.</p>
<p>If the child gets stuck on a word and can't go on, look at him gently and calmly, and then say, "I see you have been busy enough this morning. Now go drink a glass of water, I'll wait here to listen to you."</p>
<p>You shift his attention and give him plenty of time to recover his emotions. You give him an atmosphere of calm trust, and he will feel at ease. The tension that causes stuttering will then slowly relax, and he will speak much better. There are very few children with real speech defects. If such a defect is found, a specialist should be consulted immediately for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>When speaking to children, speak clearly and slowly. Do not use baby language. Do not praise slang with a smile. Slang is not a funny thing. If you don't correct it when they are young, it will be difficult to change when they grow up. At this time, you should say this word clearly once. However, there is no need to train them continuously. Children imitate the language in the family. As long as it is good language, their words will naturally become better. Give them plenty of time to learn.</p>
<h3>Sponge Cake</h3>
<p>— Gui Shi</p>
<p>One of the New Year's Foods</p>
<p>Sponge cake, its shape and size vary, but its origin has the same method as a pastry called "Ding Sheng Gao" (Victory Cake); its texture is fluffy and soft, not as hard as New Year cake, and because it cooks quickly when steamed, it has always been used by discerning housewives. Now, let's roll up our sleeves and try it out.</p>
<p>Ingredients—Three parts rice flour. One part red beans (cooked but not cracked). Two parts glutinous rice flour. Two parts white sugar.</p>
<p>The above four ingredients are the basic components for making the cake, and their proportions can be adjusted according to needs. Other ingredients such as lard, black dates, walnut meat, bean paste, rose petals (available in tea shops), etc., can be added according to personal preference.</p>
<p>Equipment—A small steamer about eight inches in diameter with a lid, and a container for holding the flour.</p>
<p>Instructions—Take three parts of rice flour, mix it evenly with two parts of glutinous rice flour in a container, add boiling water to dissolve two parts of white sugar, and mix it into coarse salt-like fine particles. Then add one part of cooked red beans (without the liquid) and mix well. Then spread it on a slightly heated steamer cloth, with a thickness of no more than one inch being the best. Add lard, black dates, roses, etc., on top to create a beautiful pattern. Once everything is ready, place the steamer in an ordinary iron pot with water and steam it for about ten minutes. When the lard on top starts to melt, that indicates the cake is cooked. If you like to make layered cakes with filling, it's the same process. Just add half of the flour mixture first, steam it until cooked, then evenly spread a layer of bean paste on top, and then add the remaining flour mixture. When you cut it open, it will have a bean paste layer.</p>
<h3>Blind Nipple Ancient Medical Method</h3>
<p>— Yun Yi</p>
<p>"Blind Nipple" is a common name, which refers to a nipple that is inverted and not firm, preventing the baby from suckling. This is due to a localized lack of development, similar to a congenital condition.</p>
<p>Although the method of using walnut shells for prevention and treatment is a good one, it is regrettable when it cannot be used during the late stages of pregnancy or after childbirth.</p>
<p>Now, based on experience, and in accordance with the academic principle of impartiality, I record a prescription below, hoping that experts in the field can provide guidance and that patients can use it.</p>
<p>I have been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for many years. One patient came to me with this condition, close to her delivery date, and hesitant to try the above-mentioned treatment. I prescribed a herbal formula for her, instructing her to take three doses. The patient followed the instructions and took three doses, and the nipple protruded, to her great joy. Since then, I have tried it on several others with similar success. The original prescription is listed below: (Adjustments to the formula can be made as needed).</p>
<p>Honey-fried Astragalus membranaceus (8 qian), Cinnamomum cassia (1 qian), honey-fried Cimicifuga rhizome (1 qian 5 fen), Xiang Da Danggui (3 qian 5 fen), Angelica dahurica (1 qian 5 fen), stir-fried Anemarrhena asphodeloides (2 qian), Akebia trifoliata (6 fen), Bupleurum chinense (1 qian 5 fen), Platycodon grandiflorus (1 qian 5 fen), Gleditsia sinensis (3 qian), Fucus thallus (1 qian). Decoct in water and take warm.</p>

<h3>Vanka</h3>
<p>— Written by Chekhov, Translated by Li Mengfei</p>
<p>(How many children joyfully receive gifts during Christmas; how many children longingly gaze upon bleak emptiness during Christmas.)</p>
<p>Nine-year-old Vanka Zhukov had been an apprentice to the shoemaker Alyakhin for three months. On Christmas Eve, he did not go to bed. He waited until the master and his wife and the senior apprentices went out to mass before he took a small bottle of ink and a pen with a rusty steel nib from the master's cupboard. Then he spread out a folded sheet of paper in front of him and began to write.</p>
<p>Before anything else, he decided to write his first letter. He looked furtively at the doors and windows and glanced at the dim icon. On both sides of the icon's wooden frame hung shoetrees. He sighed deeply and sadly. He knelt on the stool with the letter spread out on it.</p>
<p>"Dear Grandfather Konstantin Makarich," he wrote. "I am writing a letter to you. I wish you a Merry Christmas and God bless you. I have no father or mother, you are all I have."</p>
<p>Vanka looked up at the window, which reflected the light of his candle, vividly outlining his grandfather, Konstantin Makarich, who was the night watchman at Mr. Zhivarev's estate. He was a short, thin old man, but remarkably vigorous for his sixty-five years. His bloodshot eyes were always smiling. He spent his days lying in the servants' kitchen, always joking with the cook. At night, he wore a large sheepskin coat, carried a wooden staff, and paced his beat, followed by two dogs with drooping heads, a female called Kashtanka and a male called Vyun. The female dog was so called because of her black fur and slender body, which resembled an eel. Vyun was a rare, docile male dog. He looked at strangers as kindly as he looked at his master, but people did not believe his gentleness, believing that beneath his obedience and humility lay more malicious intent. No one was better than him at stealing a piece of leg of lamb or sneaking into the kitchen to steal the farmer's chicks. More than once, his hind legs had almost been broken. He had also been hanged twice, and every week he was whipped almost to death, but he always revived.</p>
<p>Vanka's grandfather always stood by the door, squinting at the bright red window of the village church, his feet stamping in his high boots, teasing people in the garden. His wooden staff hung from his belt, and he huddled himself against the cold, coughing with an old man's dry cough. He often pestered the maids or the cook.</p>
<p>"Would you like a pinch of snuff?" he would ask, taking out his snuffbox and offering it to the women, who would take a pinch and immediately sneeze.</p>
<p>The old man would laugh and shout like a madman:</p>
<p>"Sneeze it out, or it will freeze your nose!"</p>
<p>He would also put a little snuff on the dogs' noses. Kashtanka sneezed, twitched her nose, and ran away in a rage. Vyun politely refused the offering, just wagging his tail. It was truly a beautiful climate, with no wind, just a clear, frosty night. The white roofs of the entire village, smoke was rising from the chimneys, the trees were adorned with silver frost, and there were thick piles of snow everywhere. You could see the vast expanse of white. The bright stars in the sky twinkled brightly, and the Milky Way stretched across the sky, as if it had been carved from white snow especially for this festive season.</p>
<p>Vanka sighed. He dipped his pen into the inkwell and continued to write:</p>
<p>"Yesterday I received a severe beating. The master dragged me into the yard by my hair and beat me mercilessly with the boot last, because I fell asleep while rocking his brat's cradle. This week, the mistress ordered me to wash a herring, and I started scraping it from the tail, so she picked up the herring and poked the tip of it into my face. The senior apprentices also tease me, taking me to the tavern to drink vodka and making me steal the master's cucumbers. The master beats me mercilessly, regardless of whether I live or die. There is no good food; breakfast is bread, lunch is thin porridge, and supper is bread again. Tea and sour cabbage soup are only for the master and his wife to drink and eat as much as they want. They make me sleep in the entryway, and I cannot sleep at all when their dead brat cries, because I have to rock the cradle. Dear Grandfather, for God's sake, take me back to our village home, I can't take it anymore… I bow down to you, I will pray to God forever and ever. Take me away, or I will die…"</p>
<p>Vanka's lips trembled, and he wiped his eyes with his dirty fist, sobbing.</p>
<p>"I will send you tobacco," he continued to write, "I will pray to God for you. If I have done anything wrong, then whip me like that gray goat. If you really think I can't find work, I will ask the manager. For God's sake, let me shine boots, or let me replace Fedka as a shepherd. Dear Grandfather, I can't stand it anymore, they will abuse me… I want to run away to our village, but I don't have boots, and I'm afraid of the severe frost. When I grow up, I will take care of you, no one will want to hurt you. When you pass away, I will pray for the peace of your soul, just like praying for my mother Pelageya."</p>
<p>"About Moscow, it is a large city, there are many houses of the rich, many horses, but no sheep, and the dogs are not very vicious. Children don't wear star badges at Christmas, and no one is allowed to sing in the choir. Once, I saw a shop window with fishing rods, hooks, and ropes hanging for sale at low prices. Those hooks are very convenient for catching any kind of fish. There is also another fishhook that can catch a one-pound catfish. There are also shops selling guns, with guns like the one used by the master. I reckon a gun must cost a hundred rubles. The butcher shops have quail, partridge, and hare, but who hunts them, or where they run from, the shopkeepers don't want to say.</p>
<p>"Dear Grandfather, pick a golden walnut for me from the master's Christmas tree and hide it in my green box. Tell the mistress Olga Ignatievna that Vanka asked for this walnut."</p>
<p>Vanka sighed and looked out the window again. He remembered how his grandfather used to run into the forest to cut down a Christmas tree, taking his grandson with him, how happy those times were! The frost cracked and crunched under his grandfather's feet, and Vanka stepped the same way, before cutting down the Christmas tree. His grandfather smoked his pipe, took a pinch of snuff, and made fun of the poor, frozen Vanka… The little fir trees stood still, adorned with frost, not knowing which one was waiting to die. Suddenly, a hare jumped out from somewhere and plunged into the snowdrift… His grandfather could not help shouting:</p>
<p>"Catch him, catch him, catch him! Ah, you short-tailed devil!"</p>
<p>After the Christmas tree was cut down, his grandfather dragged it to the master's house, and they began to decorate it. Mistress Olga, Vanka's most glorious friend, was busy with it.</p>
<p>When Vanka's mother, Pelageya, was still alive, Mistress Olga always gave him pieces of candy cane, and when she was free, she taught him to read and write, to count from one to a hundred, and even played four-group dancing games. When Pelageya died, they sent the orphan Vanka to the kitchen to be with his grandfather, and then from the kitchen, they sent him to the shoemaker Alyakhin in Moscow.</p>
<p>"Come quickly, dear Grandfather," Vanka continued to write, "I beg you, for God's sake, take me away from here. Have pity on a weak orphan. Here, they beat me and starve me to death. I cannot tell you how sad I am, I am always crying. One day, the master hit my head with a boot last, and I fell down, beating me half to death. My life is so miserable, not even a dog’s…….. I send my regards to Alyona and one-eyed Yegorka and the coachman, but don't let anyone take my harmonica. Your grandson Ivan Zhukov, dear Grandfather, must come."</p>
<p>Vanka folded the paper into four and inserted it into an envelope bought with a copper coin he had asked for before dinner. He thought for a moment, dipped the pen into the black ink bottle, and then wrote the address:</p>
<p>"To the village, to my Grandfather." Then he scratched his head, thought for a moment, and added: "Konstantin Makarich." He was very happy that no one had interfered with his writing. He put on his hat and ran out into the street without his sheepskin coat.</p>
<p>He had asked the poultry vendor before dinner, and he knew that the letter had to be put into the mailbox, and from there, they would deliver the letters to all locations. The drunken postman would drive a carriage ringing a bell from door to door. Vanka ran to the first mailbox and slipped his precious letter through the slot.</p>
<p>An hour later, he was comforted by hope and slept soundly. In his dream, he saw the stove, and by the stove sat his grandfather, with his bare feet, reading the letter to the cook, and Vyun wagged his tail around the stove.</p>

<p>Drunk and carefree, warm fragrance floats like snow, filling the wine, the spring waters of the great river flow eastward, green grass on both banks, not waiting for the moon to be full and the flowers to be in full bloom, speaking of leisure, old friends spend the night together, several times the songs of woodcutters, several times the dragons sing, several times the apes howl.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 158</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This auspicious interpretation of "eight" is also a product of China; it seems based on the saying "If you want to prosper, you can't do without eight." Apart from this, I can't think of any other brilliant theories. Now that Pingzi has instructed you to pay attention to the secret of "eight," to be honest, you have to use a Japanese mind to figure it out. Fortunately, you already have several explanations, so why not say them out and let everyone discuss them?" Tsurumi continued his explanation.</p>
<p>"I think these few that I have figured out are not sufficient. Just now, didn't we send a telegram to "〇Twelve"? It also contains this item. Perhaps he can give us a more satisfactory answer. As for the first one I figured out, I'm afraid the "eight" that Pingzi is referring to is the "Eight Major Forward Secret Stations for the Promotion of the Greater East Asia Program" drafted by the General Staff Headquarters!"</p>
<p>"When was this announced?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It hasn't been announced yet. I only saw the final draft, which was also obtained from the department by a colleague."</p>
<p>"The so-called Greater East Asia Program...?" I haven't heard of this term before.</p>
<p>"This is a new contribution from the Fifth Column. In fact, it is an old tune from Ito Hirobumi's time; nothing more than "To conquer the world, one must first conquer East Asia," and so on. Although the war on the mainland has already been launched, in the eyes of Konoe and the young officers, this move is only the prelude. According to them, occupying China is not a problem at all. The most important thing is to deal with the countermeasures against Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The main way to counter them is to first establish eight forward secret stations!"</p>
<p>"Eight?" I was a little skeptical that eight seemed too few.</p>
<p>"Yes," Tsurumi changed his cigarette, "exactly eight secret bases."</p>
<p>"Roughly speaking, they are nothing more than Hong Kong, Haiphong, Singapore..."</p>
<p>"Don't guess wildly. Your thinking doesn't fit Japanese logic. Let me tell you – first, to deal with the Soviet Union; the Soviet trans-Eurasian railway, the closest stronghold to Japan, is Chita..."</p>
<p>"What?" I thought Tsurumi was wrong.</p>
<p>"Chita," Tsurumi repeated.</p>
<p>"That's not right..." I objected with confidence, "Didn't you say the Soviet railway's closest stronghold to Japan?"</p>
<p>"Correct."</p>
<p>"How can it be Chita? Even elementary school students know that the Soviet trans-Eurasian railway terminus is Vladivostok; it is also the closest to Japan."</p>
<p>"Haha, haha!" Tsurumi laughed wildly.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I was a little unconvinced.</p>
<p>"Old Brother," Tsurumi said with a smile, "you underestimate Japan too much! At least, you don't know how crazy the Japanese military is!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" I admitted that much.</p>
<p>"Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese Ministry of Defense, with Tokyo as the center, has long covered all parts of the mainland with a circle of two thousand five hundred kilometers. The outer edge of the defense has already extended to Mongolia and the eastern coastal areas of China. Now, according to them, this large circle has already become a two-layer inner circle. You, old brother, are still dreaming!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" I admitted that I was indeed dreaming.</p>

<h3>Endless Tricks Keep Coming: Banknotes Turned into Marble</h3>
<p>— Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>After the victory, we often see many "clever" tricks, which make people clap their hands in amazement. Everyone who has seen them has already remembered them, so there is no need to mention them again. Now let's mention something fresh. "The more it changes, the more magical it becomes," with the wonder of "transformation to perfection," it is exactly: "Endless tricks keep coming."</p>
<p>We have already "learned" the "patterns" of "Golden Award Steel" and "Gold Turned into Shit." Here, I want to introduce to you a set of "novel magic," which is: "Banknotes Turned into Marble." According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Hong Kong on the 31st, Hong Kong newspapers reported on that day that the Central Bank had previously commissioned the printing of 500 yuan banknotes in the United States, 500 boxes. After printing, they were shipped to India and stored for a considerable period of time before being shipped to Shanghai. Recently, 300 boxes were shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou. On the 30th, when they arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong, it was discovered that 30 boxes of banknotes, worth about 80 million yuan, had been stolen. The Hong Kong Central Bank officials discovered when they opened the boxes that the banknotes had "disappeared" (probably by airplane). They were replaced by marble made in India. In addition to the marble, a women's short coat was found in one of the ten boxes. The Hong Kong Central Bank representative said: "It is not yet certain whether the banknotes were stolen in Shanghai, Hong Kong, or Guangzhou; but it is believed that the theft occurred in India." His "logic" is: "Since the boxes contain marble made in India, the theft "must" have occurred in India."</p>
<p>It seems that this "strange case" will again end without resolution. Even if there is an investigation, the "discovery" is already late, the location of the theft is difficult to "investigate," and nothing can be traced.</p>
<p>Eighty million yuan is a "small" amount, but banknotes can be turned into marble, plus a women's short coat. This set of "novel and eye-catching" "magic" is worth mentioning, so that everyone can appreciate it. China has such "skilled" "magicians"!</p>
<p>The "peep show" of "Gold Turned into Copper" and "Gold Turned into Shit" has not yet been debunked, and now a set of "Banknotes Turned into Marble" has been staged in quick succession. "How many tricks," the Chinese people's "visual enjoyment" is not shallow. If these kinds of things all become "unsolved cases," the "performers" will become "more skilled and daring," their courage will become stronger and stronger, and the "patterns" will "change more and more magically." In the future, who knows what "new tricks" will be "transformed" out?</p>
<p>Behind the Scenes of World War II Old News</p>
<h3>A Small Czech Village Receives a Windfall (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated from "International Digest" by Jia Yuan</p>
<p>Six Million US Dollars Distributed to All</p>
<p>Of What Use is Gold When Life is Precarious?</p>
<p>So this seasoned officer—whose name is not recorded in the Czechoslovakian government's files—said to his sergeant: "Who knows if I'll be alive tomorrow? Who knows if I'll see Berlin? Let's distribute this money to the villagers."</p>
<p>Then, he said: "Sergeant, you take care of this. Find a way to give a share to every man, every woman, every child. Ask everyone's age and give them one thousand Koruna (Czech currency) for each year of their age. I think that should be enough to distribute."</p>
<p>Residents of Sasstin Village Instantly Became Millionaires</p>
<p>After solving this difficult problem, he lay down on a cot and fell peacefully asleep.</p>
<p>On this bright spring day, the docile residents of Sasstin Village suddenly became millionaires. The amount distributed that day totaled 300 million Koruna (equivalent to six million US dollars).</p>
<p>In the first few hours, the villagers of Sasstin were completely stunned. They couldn't believe their extraordinary luck, unable to determine if it was real or a dream. Larger families received as much as fifteen to twenty thousand "Koruna." Everyone ran to the shops like mad, spending to their heart's content.</p>
<p>In an instant, Sasstin became perhaps the fastest place for inflation in history. A shave, which originally cost three Koruna, now cost three thousand. The village's entire economy fell into chaos. Everyone became rich, workers refused to work, factories completely shut down, and merchants sold all their inventory at exorbitant prices.</p>
<p>Too Much Cash, Prices Soar</p>
<p>After the stores in Sasstin Village sold out their inventory, the villagers rushed to nearby towns and villages, causing prices in those places to soar as well. The northeastern corner of the Czech Republic seemed to have experienced a financial earthquake, with Sasstin as the epicenter.</p>
<p>However, the villagers were not foolish enough to spend all of their newly acquired assets at once. After the initial excitement, many people hid the remaining money, burying it in gardens or cellars.</p>
<p>In mid-May, the head of the Bratislava bank inspected the missing banknotes in the vault and discovered that the lost money was scattered in Sasstin. However, the bank could not force the public to return the funds, so the Czech government asked them to voluntarily hand them over, to see how patriotic they were.</p>
<p>Villagers Patriotically Donate to the Government</p>
<p>Then, an unbelievable thing happened: the villagers of Sasstin began to dig up their gardens, unearthing 115 million Koruna to return to the government. The remaining 185 million Koruna was probably scattered in other towns and villages.</p>
<p>Today, Sasstin has returned to its former tranquility, with pastoral scenery just as it was before. But the villagers will never forget the extraordinary windfall that came a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Liying (Shizeng), a well-known figure in academic and political circles, is one of the respected elders, along with Wu Zhihui and others. Mr. Li, who is nearly seventy years old, suddenly married Ms. Lin Shanshan yesterday, shaving his head to become a new groom, which is a widely celebrated event, not letting Xiong Bubi and Mao Yanwen and Wang Zhengting have all the attention.</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Li advocated simplicity in diet, preparing two dishes and one soup for each meal. Hence, there was the saying: "Li Shizeng's meal isn't as good as Dr. Zheng ____'s cigarette."</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Europe and America mostly open tofu shops. It is said that in Paris, the "world capital," there is also a "Chinese Tofu Company," whose shareholders are mostly important figures from our country, and Mr. Li Shizeng once served as the manager of the company.</p>
<p>In addition to traveling overseas, Mr. Li spends his days studying knowledge with other scholars. The "World Academy" at 393 Rue de Saisons in Shanghai is a place he frequents.</p>
<p>According to people close to Li Guangsheng, Mr. Li often strokes his beard and writes books leisurely at the "World Academy." Every time he sees a woman, he always squints and sweeps his eyes across, expressing his disgust. Even the servants working in the academy were not allowed to bring their female relatives to stay overnight. Has this strange temper changed today?</p>
<p>When the Pacific War broke out, Mr. Li was in Hong Kong. Before the Japanese invaders entered, he took the last plane and went straight to Honolulu, escaping danger.</p>
