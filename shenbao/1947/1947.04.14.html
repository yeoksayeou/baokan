<p>〔本報訊〕將主席於前日偕夫人自杭來滬後，接見地方　長士紳，招待外賓，　詢市政，　注物價，甚爲辛勞。今日將赴中正公園檢閱靑年軍第二〇二師。</p>
<p>六時許，主席夫婦遂驅車往南京路外灘，金陵路一帶巡視市容。</p>

<p>席間李氏向主席述及關於組織韓政府問題及在美與美政府當局協商情形，並表示代表韓國人民向主席致敬感　協助韓臨時政府之熱忱，對主　在開羅會議時竭一力擁護助韓獨立主張，尤表感激。</p>
<p>主席當即表示對於韓國爭取獨立，極爲同情，並稱，中韓兩國向爲兄弟之邦，當互助合作。中國決定最大努力，協助韓國成立政府，並連連吿渠「請你放心」</p>
<p>主席又詢及金九氏近况，夫人亦稱當金九氏在渝時，與主席等友誼極爲密切，故甚關懷。李氏即代爲致謝，並稱金氏與渠二人合作甚密，韓國人民均盼渠等二人同能出任領袖。</p>
<h3>組織韓國政府麥帥表示贊助</h3>
<p>記者於昨晚特再訪李氏於華懋飯店，詢其與蔣主席會晤情形。</p>
<p>記者詢以有關韓本國情形，承吿如下：</p>
<p>問：麥帥對於組織政府意見如何？</p>
<p>答：麥帥與吾等保持合作，渠亦極盼韓國政府及早成立。</p>
<p>問：霍奇將軍對組織政府是吾與麥師意見一致？</p>
<p>答；霍奇將軍對組織政府之意見，現已與麥帥趨於一致。渠並已放棄前所主張韓政府之組織內，必須有共產黨員參加，而表示共黨欲否參加政府，可聽其自由。</p>
<h3>蘇在韓國徵丁據稱確有其事</h3>
<p>問：霍奇將軍向美發表，蘇聯在韓國北部徵少年兵五十萬之事，請問李博士有無同樣情報？</p>
<p>答：霍奇將軍所稱之歡字，甚爲準確並係事實，蓋吾等所得報告，亦相同也。</p>

<p>答：希望能在三個月內完成。</p>
<p>問：韓國內共黨問題，目前情情如何？</p>
<p>答；韓國南部，可謂並無所謂共黨問題，所有共黨份子，大都來自北部，致發生不安情形。</p>
<p>問：韓國經濟情形如何？</p>
<p>答：非常困難，蓋自韓國南北分成二段後，南韓雖有食糧等產物，而工廠燃料，電力等均在北部。目前整個經濟機構已呈「痳痺」狀態。</p>

<h3>日供賠償用之國內資產　總值千三百億美元　各國所提總額較最高估價起出數倍　美要求優先得流動資金</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕據悉：美國所提建議中，日本國內資產供給償各國川者，其總値約在一千三百億至一千五百億美元之間。中國所要求者約與美國所要求者相同或較高。此外，英國，蘇聯，菲列濱，紐西蘭，澳大利，印度，加拿大，荷蘭及法國，均擬在最近期內提出其要求之數目。此間官方指出，各國所要求之總額以幣値計算，將較日本資產之最高估値，超出數倍。各國所要求之數額，祇可作爲計算各國所應得賠償之百分比而已。官方表示，眞正重要因素有二；（一）將准許日本保留之工業水準；（二）遠東委員會十一委員國對於超過此保留水準以上之全部日本工業資產之實際分配問題。至日本之海外產業，不在分配之列，因每一戰勝祇須將其領土內之日本資產視爲已有可矣。</p>
<p>日本國內相當數目之流動資金，例如金塊及其他類似物，當然亦能被盟國沒收，但美國已聲明，渠已考慮其對該項物資要求之優先權，以補償美國佔領費用，供給日本糧食費用，及貸與日本以棉花等原料，使其工業恢復生產之費用（該項費用預料將由日本出口貨及製成品償還之）。如此，此二者可折合賠償，因佔領之糧食費用料將等於或超渦日本所可償付美國之流動炎產總額也。</p>
<p>據美方官員稱：日本所考慮其賠償之範圍如下：（一）日本願放棄其所有國外產業，（二）日本願放棄其國內所有流動資金，以供償付佔領糧食費用；（三）日本願放棄遠東委員會所決定之水準以上之全部工業資產，付與十一個遠東委員會會員國。如遠東委員會在其會議中採取美國之建議，則日本賠償之水準，應較一九四六年初鮑萊之報吿所提出之賠償數目少百分之十，但較一九四六年中鮑萊所提出最後報造中之數目多百分之十五。至於可供賠償之日本產業總額，迄今尙未成立明白協議。此間官方相信，須待華府國務院官員，陸軍部官員與來此商議之駐日盟軍總部官員共同商磋後，始可獲得其最可靠之佔計。</p>
<h3>日紡織業迅速擴張　我將受嚴重影響　黃元彬建議限制日紗錠數額</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕此間經濟界，對於戰後日本紡織業之迅速擴張，（此一工業，乃盟軍總部業已決定日本應保留輕工業之一。）頗感焦慮。由於中國紡織工廠在戰時損失慘重，仍形落後，深恐日本紡織品可能重進入包括中國在內之遠東市塲，而受其操比你，如戰前情形然。二月中起草經濟緊急揹施方案之經濟政策委員會重要份子之黃元彬氏，對日本有恢復高壓力競爭之危險性作警吿稱：此將使中國受戰爭摧殘尙未復興之紡織業受到嚴重打擊，渠指出日本紗廠，現復工者，已有三百萬錠，另有三百萬錠亦即可開始運用，而中國現有之錠數，共計不過一百四十萬錠。渠對委克阿瑟之建議，將日本紡織機件，不列入賠償拆遝項目之內，頗示不滿，指斥日本保有此項紡織工業，足證其仍包藏對華再度侵略野心，至少是在經濟方面。渠透露：經濟政策委員會對此一情形，極爲注意，故指定渠爲負責研究對策之人。渠建議：中國應　速派遣代表赴日，與盟軍總部商討，限制日本保留紗錠，使之達最低限度，並爲防制日本可能之競爭起見，應提高關稅，並改革幣制，以便制定合理之稅率。渠又建議：中國棉產，應予增加。</p>

<h3>蘇北民間印象記（二）　百姓需要全面安定</h3>
<p>— 本報記者章繩治</p>
<p>「需要確保治安，在安定中求生活。」這是每一個留居蘇北的老百姓的迫切呼籲。</p>
<p>在共產黨燒和殺的恐怖政策下，迫使廣大的民衆開始家破人亡，顚沛流離。更使社會秩序，破壞無遺，造或了現在蘇北普遍的慘象。當我們在這塊肥沃的土地上行進的時候，限看大好河山偏偏是血腥遍地，這是多麼令人憤慨的一回事。</p>
<p>老百姓口口聲聲的說：「我們僅僅保住幾個點的安定是不够的，因爲蘇北的安定，繫住在廣大面積的農村裘」。但是我們再聽聽軍事當局的意見：「認爲蘇北要眞正確保治安，非蘇北人自己振作不可，即是說一定要做到武化蘇北，做到人人有槍，人人爲自己的家鄕起來悍衛不可」。</p>
<p>但是說話容易，做起來問題又多了，這其問又發生了政治工作的問題。李司令官曾經在公開集會中說過；「共產黨在蘇北唯一的成功，就是政治工作做得好，他們有組織，有訓練，有統一的行動。由此可以明白共產黨到現在還能存在的道理，主要條件就在於此」。</p>
<p>至於說到加强幹部一點，這工作在蘇北並不是沒有做，而是沒有做好。於是所造成的結果，反而比沒有做更要糟糕。「流弊」這兩個字，害了整個的計劃，好的人不想幹區鄉長，壞的人唯恐求之而不得。於是老百姓在夾縫中攪得啼笑皆非，死活不得。一方面恐怖着共產黨的燒和殺，一方面又害怕着「壞痞子」的狐假虎威，敲詐勒索。</p>
<p>因此連帶的又發生了一種微妙的作用，亦是一個極端嚴重的問題，人在本能的求生之下，那一個人不怕燒和殺？於是共產黨摸着了一般人偷生怕死的弱點，在威迫利誘的手段下，達到了他的陰謀。因爲人民想要免吃限前虧，不少人就在這種矛盾的心理下，被强迫的投到共軍的手裏。所以說蘇北目前的戰事依然能够此起彼伏的演進着的緣故，主要的關鍵就是在這一批永遠沒有完的「民兵手」手裏，眞正的共軍不過站在幕後，做着牽綫的工作罷了！</p>
<p>在爭取民衆的手法上，顯然的，在收復區內做得相當的失敗，我們所看到的鄉村自衛隊，一二十條槍，他們都是需要化相當的代價買來的，同時還不一定枝枝都能放得饗，並且訓練的期間不够，一旦有事，就不容易起作用。但是共軍相反的都擁有相當數量的被利用了的民兵，他們更多是蘇北的土著，情形熟，地理熟，日間混在老百姓當中，探聽消息，一到夜間拿起槍來，就成了燒和殺的代表者，縱然國軍有精良的武器，猛烈的火力，但對這些散居廣大面積上的游民散匪，試問又有什麼用處？</p>
<p>我們再來看看目前共產黨在蘇北用的兵力。拿最近一次的李堡戰事而言，共軍曾動因了十一個獨立團的番號，實際上這許多團，就是利用民兵來編成的，而國軍在這一次戰役中，除了靠火力强盛之外，白白的死傷了九百餘個戰士。當李堡戰事行將結束的時候，李堡又有四百多個老百姓，在共軍撤退的時候，給順便帶走了，無疑的，共軍又巧妙的補充了一部份的兵力。</p>
<p>由此我們得到一個結論，亦是李司令官所說的：「爲什麼共產黨可以利用民兵打我們，而我們不能動員民衆打共產黨，唯一的理由，就是共產黨在政治工作上有嚴密的組織」。所以我們想要眞正的確保治安，非要軍政當局分層負責，嚴守紀律不可！</p>
<p>記得當記者團到海門的時候，一位老百姓在人叢中偷偷地將一封信塞到記者的手裘，後來我看了，深深的感到這就是「工作沒有做好」的一個後果。</p>
<p>其中最主要的一點，是認爲地方保安隊的紀律太差。其實這句話，不僅是海門人如此說，我亦會經聽到蘇北任何角落裏有類乎如此的說法。同時現在少數鄉臨區長，更是過去「三朝元老」，倒眞的是「經騐」豐富，「貪汚」能手，任何事可以做得上下其手，天衣無縫。老百姓曾經有一句極痛心的話，我們不怕「苦不堪言」，却怕「苦不敢言」。因爲老百姓明明吃了虧，你去問他，他不但不敢說，而且還要忍痛吾認呢！</p>

<h3>揭開中菲關係的新頁</h3>
<p>中菲友好條約業經雙方商定，定於本日在馬尼拉由中菲兩國代表簽字成立，不僅使中菲兩國間所有的猜疑與誤會完全氷釋，替中菲邦交揭開一頁新頁；而且也使北太平洋的和平與安全，又獲一重可靠的保障。所以中菲友好條約的簽字，實具有重大的意義，値得我們的重視；條約的內容如何，因官方尙未正式公佈，故不得而知；但是我們回顧與前瞻，不難證明中菲友好條約，對於中美菲三國都有着非常密切的關係，甚至對於整個太平洋局勢也會發生重要作用。</p>
<p>中非友好條約的發起，遠在菲律濱獲得正式獨立之前，我國駐菲島總領事段茂瀾氏，於一九四五年十一月間，就向美國高級專員麥克努持提議，商訂中菲友好條約，麥氏首先表示贊成，並曾與菲律濱總統奧斯敏納商談此事，惟以當時菲島尙未正式獨立，當不便進行。及至一九四六年六七月間，我國乘菲島於七月四日正式宣佈獨立的機會，乃任命甘乃光氏爲特使，前任馬尼刺參加菲律濱共和國獨立典禮，順便與該國總統羅哈斯曁外長季里諾，商訂中菲友好條約。同時我國外長王世杰爲慶祝菲島獨立計，也在是日發表談話稱：「茲當歡迎此新共和國之時，吾人願作一保證，卽中國政府及人民對菲共和國之通力合作，必如對其他友邦一樣，不稍减色；中菲不僅爲增進兩國福利計，必須合作；欲使遠東休戚相關之增强睦誼得以樹立，俾全世界和平與進步能獲保障，中菲合作實爲必不可少之因素。』中國政府竭誠盼望與菲共和國締結友好條約，在王外長的談話中，也就可以獲一明證了。</p>
<p>中非訂約談判，從去年七月七日開始，起初非常順利，我國提出的友好條約草約，經菲國政府討論後，在原則上也已表示贊成，照理一俟我國第一任駐菲公使到任履新之後，就可以簽字的了；但是菲政府所提出的修正案，其中有兩條要求加入條約者：（一）締約國爲一主權國，自有權頒佈任何法律；另一締約國之僑民，有遵守之義務；（二）菲共和國畀予美國之特權，中國不得享受。這種修正案，顯然與友好精神相違背，當非我國所能接近；因此中美訂約談判在事實上也就陷於停頓狀態了。菲總統羅哈斯於去年八月卅日雖然仍宜稱：『中菲兩國應永遠保持友好；」但是友好條約的簽字却無限期的展延了。僅因實際上的需要，對於兩國間的民航事業，不得不先行成立一個臨時協定，而永久性質的協定，一則需要從長計議，別則友好條約不簽字，這些協定當不能先行產生的。</p>
<p>從此訂約談判旣陷於僵局，而菲國對於我華僑的「不友好行爲」，更是愈演愈烈；我們對於這一段中菲間的不幸事件，自不願意再加以詳述，僅就菲方採取損害我華僑利益的各種措施，歸納起來，也有下列各項：（一）菲國會提案中之勞工菲化案，强迫華僑僱用菲人，在全體雇員中佔百分之六十，（二）零售商菲化案，禁止華僑爲零售商；（三）攤販菲化案，主張華僑不得爲攤販：（四）將中國移民入菲之限額减去原數十分之九。此外，菲當局對於華僑的暴行，任意逮捕華僑，並非法搜查華僑報館，更是罄竹難書。當時我國政府一方面珍惜中菲問的友誼，另一方面又看到甫自多年感受壓迫中解放出來的民族，竟也走上這條錯誤的道路，不得不一再勸吿非政府不能忘了旅菲華僑數十年來對菲島發展與繁榮的貢獻，更不能忘了華僑參加游擊戰與美菲聯軍駢肩作戰的光榮。</p>
<p>菲國當局經我國數度勸吿之後，也深知今後的國際關係，應該是一個講信修陸的時代，尤其是在中菲之問，羅哈斯總統心中最爲明白：我國駐菲公使陳質平氏，於去年十一月間，又返國請示，回任後中菲重開談判，簽訂新約之說，又一度甚囂塵上，直到今年二月間，菲外交部忽另以新草約送達我公使館，此項草約不啻將雙方數月談判的結果，全部推翻，誠如所謂一波三折，於是中菲談判又陷於僵局了。因此我國政府乃不得不向菲國提出强硬照會，表示在這種環境之下，不得不將談判暫予停頓。這個賢明措施，不僅爲我旅菲華僑所一致讚揚，並能喚起菲國朝野的覺醒。菲外交部乃提出覆文，表示菲國準備繼續討論，我國當予以考慮，惟所討論者，仍須根據業已商得同意的條款。至本月九日，中菲談判終於在碧瑤重開了。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知中菲商訂友好條約，已經過多少次的磨折與考騐，現在終算克服難關商有成議，不得不說是中菲人民良智的勝利。太平洋的和平與安全，有賴中美菲三國的通力合作；天經地義，是不能吾認的。卽以菲國目前的情形而論，菲國在政治上雖已取得了獨立：但在國防上，仍以美國的支持是賴，依照美菲軍事協定，非國七知個島嶼雖然完全由自己建設國防，但是美國仍保留其基地，供其海空軍使用：就此一點而論，菲國的眞正獨立自主，尙須有一個時期的努力：我們認爲菲國如欲同時完成經濟的自主與政治的獨立，測與中國合作共同維持太平洋的和平與繁榮，實在是一個不可缺少的因素。菲國政治家，應該放大眼光，運用其智慧，努力促進中菲間的邦交；我們但願中菲外交，從今天簽訂友好條約之日起，眞能揭開其新頁！</p>

<h3>未來對德和會召開辦法　美蘇意未一致　對德和由四強起草</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十二日電〕按照蘇聯建議，在應參加德國和會諸國中，我國名次列於四強之後，而在其他會與德國作戰國家之前。其建議中認為阿爾巴尼亞亦應出息對德和會。蘇聯此一建議案，僅獲得發過之支持。按照美國建議，則應有五十三國家參加德國和會，莫洛托夫反對美國建議，其所持理由，即美國所擬合之組織法中，將包括土，菲及烏拉圭。四外長今正式同意德合約應僅由簽字於德降書上之四強起草，蘇英主張使德國之適當政府，在合約上簽字。美國建議在德國憲法中說明條約僅基於盟國協議之和平解決辦法。米洛托夫認為德政府之簽字必不可少，浴室德國須有一負責機構實現條約之決定條款，一如其付庸國家所簽之條約然。又日政府即被認為有簽約之資格，然則何以獨使德國例外。馬歇爾提折衷辦法，記在德國情形相當發展而能考慮明確之和平解決辦法時，即由其接受。貝文準備接受馬氏建議，貝文嗣詢以中國為和會邀請國事有無協議，莫洛托夫稱，渠已表示意見，但卒未獲協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十二日電〕關於中國應否為對德和會邀請國一項問題，因蘇聯代表之堅決反對，本日死過外長會議仍未能解決。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十二日電〕外長代表於今日下午繼續討論德和會程序中諸爭執之點，惟已消減若干困難，但原則仍無變動。最有效之貢獻，為英代表團所提使輕薄及諮詢委員會分為兩個委員會之建議。諮詢委員會之委員，以四強，德國鄰邦盟國及會以軍隊參加德作戰之其他國家，包括伊朗在內擔任。情報委員會由四強及其他一切與德宣戰之國組織。情報委員會之任務，在獲取關於德國合約談判之情報及文件，諮詢委員會則可就此等情報及文件提出書面意見。</p>
<p>此項建議可使伊朗參加與否之問題，獲得適當之解決。</p>
<h3>外長會議同意　討論四強公約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十二日電〕外長會議今日統一在十四日討論美方所提四十年國防德公約一案，處理此外長會議最後難題。同時各外長同意將一部分德國問題交還外長代表及柏林盟國管制委員會討論，以待數月後外長再度開會。此乃蘇聯初次統一該類程序問題，足見重大問題僵局在本屆會議中不致打開。英美法三國贊成而蘇聯至今反對四國公約，如果不克成立協議，則各外長對重大問題將失去最後妥協機會。美國務卿馬歇爾特別重視四國公約，據稱，四國若能一致團結，防止德國侵略，則安全問題即不必關心，各國對於蘇聯要求提高德國工業水準及自現行德國生產中抽取賠償等經濟問題，自較易作讓步。蘇聯讓若拒訂公約，美國對此種難題所抱態度恐將趨強硬。今日會議中各外長並商定限本年度以前實施德國土地改革，明年十二月三十一日以前摧毀德國全部防禦公事，明年六月三十日以前清理德國各戰時工廠。</p>

<h3>法所持立場　與比過希望相符</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社比利時京城十二日電〕比利時萊因問題研究委員會本日發表公報稱：法國外長比杜爾在莫斯科四國外長會議對於德國西陲邊界，萊因區在法理上之地位及　爾區在法理上地位三項重要問題所採取立場，正與比利時之希望不謀而合。本委員會相信比利時政府對於此國在上開三地區安全所需之情形，必能加以有力保障云。</p>
<h3>法要求凱爾港</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十二日電〕法外交部發言人成：皮杜爾外長作在莫斯科會議提出對萊茵河岸斯特拉斯堡對面凱爾港之要求，純屬本於經濟上之動機。該港與斯特拉斯堡有吊橋相通。法國並不欲使該港於德國脫離政治關係，但要求由法人使用該港，俾與斯特拉斯堡密切合作。在佔領時期法國已發起共同使用兩港，經過成績相當滿意。</p>
<h3>蘇駐匈軍隊減少</h3>
<p>〔路透社布達佩斯十二日電〕蘇駐匈軍隊迅速減少，蘇聯政府並以請匈政府准其在匈牙利若干城設置領事署，可見佔領狀態渴望早日結束。第一個領事署擬設在戈爾城，其他四城亦將相機設立，署員總數約有百人。今日駐匈蘇軍總數在五六萬人之間，最高　時期認輸曾達一百二十萬至一百五十萬人。匈牙利今日被佔領之負擔已不甚重，人民並不感受限制，街頭蘇兵亦不多見，糾紛時間極少發生，惟有欲往匈國辯解外者，仍須於持有匈牙利護照外，更持有蘇當局發給之出境證，但檢視證件非由蘇兵擔任，而係由匈牙利官員擔任。</p>
<h3>英國商務代表團　月內前往莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十二日電〕頃悉：英國商務代表團由對外貿易部大臣威爾遜率領，擬於本月杪前往莫斯科，與蘇聯當局商訂英蘇兩國上午協定。緣自大戰結束依賴，英蘇上午關係在實際上已無形停頓，迄今最近英國糧食部始與蘇聯成立協議，由蘇聯以罐頭沙門魚十五萬箱一級罐頭蟹二萬五千箱輸入英國云。</p>
<h3>土國報紙闡明　該國戰時立場</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安哥拉十二日電〕半官機關「烏魯斯報」今日載稱：土耳其會準備於一九四四年參戰，但美國正式通知土耳其政府謂不欲在巴爾幹半道開關另一戰线，致未現實。查一九四三年開羅會議詩俾與英土同盟條約相符。故土國之不參戰，咎在三強，而不在土國本身。加之英國並不實踐諾言，供給土耳其軍火與配備，亦使土國不能作戰云。</p>
<h3>蘇船隊長征</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕莫斯科電台今日宣佈，蘇聯帆船與汽船隊將自拉達維亞處罰，通過大西洋，循巴拿馬運河，跨太平洋而回至濱海省之伯力港，加入該地蘇聯太平洋玉川隊。蘇聯船隊此種長征，為數十年來未有。</p>

<h3>外長會議已逾五週　重要問題均未解決</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十三日電〕外長會議開會五星期，仍僵持如恒。上星期內唯一之發展，乃為由尚未解決之關於盟管會報告書之僵局，進為關於德國疆界問題之僵局。討論疆界問題三日之唯一協議，乃為解決定盟國對德之土地要求，應先交外此審查，並交專家委員會研究之原則，然蘇聯仍力主波德講解已由波茨坦協定肯定規定，不容推翻，故不應列入討論，而英美法三國則認波茨坦協定之規定，乃係臨時性者。另一重大未解決之點，乃為法國要求使薩爾併入其經濟範圍，而莫洛托夫表示尚須繼續研究。馬歇爾於昨日討論會爾問題時暗示希望於完畢外長會之議程後，能重新討論德國經濟統一之問題，可見四強尚未完全放棄就此一重大問題成立協定之希望。若干觀察家相信本屆外長會至少對於重訂德國工業水準支點，能夠成立決議，良以如欲由外長會向盟管會頻發指令，以使盟國執行當局德繼續依照四強基礎而工作，則工業水準之問題不得不先行解決故也。</p>
<h3>德未來政制問題　本屆外長會決放棄討論</h3>
<p>〔和衆社莫斯科十二日電〕外長會議本日決放棄在此屆會議中獲致德國未來政制問題協議之希望，並議決將此項問題以及許多次要問題發向外次會議及德境盟國管制委員會討論，並令於下屆外長會議前完成之。此舉表示四強外長廣泛討論一切問題之後，已決定不談議程中所有次要問題，而重新討論賠償，經濟統一，及疆界等各項基本問題。外長會議本日之重要決議案，即為各外長同意目前絕不提及德國臨時政府之性質，形式，各範圍等問題。</p>
<h3>葡危機潛伏　陸軍嚴事戒備</h3>
<p>〔路透社里斯本十二日電〕里斯本碼頭工人數千於兩週罷工以來，迄未復工，而其他工人復又紛紛響應，似有以普遍罷工，脅破薩拉柴總理讓步或辭職之意。葡國陸軍業已奉令留營待命，以便隨時出動鉅壓。同事據悉，葡陸軍內部，亦已是搖動，昨日有高級軍官四人鳳鳴赴凡特角羣島及馬台拉，官方謂係奉調前往該處供職，實則彼等已被視為不安分子，故予他調。最近辛特拉飛機場，復有陸軍飛機數架遭人破壞。昨日里斯本人與北部之電話线，亦一度被切斷。政府方面對此次工潮及隱伏動亂之反響，僅稱工潮係由共產黨煽動，盼工人勿為國際共產陰謀派所惑。當局對於罷工者採用高壓政策，工人區內武裝警察密佈，見有多人聚集，即以棍棒猛擊驅逐。里斯本車站戒備嚴密，隔岸工廠區，形式極為緊張。</p>
<h3>杜魯門援助希土方案　丘吉爾轉文讚揚　謂蘇聯不敢貿然掀起戰爭</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日電〕丘吉爾為「紐約時報」及「生活雜誌」所撰兩篇論文之第二篇，關於杜魯門之援助希臘土耳其方案一文中聲稱：英國及不列顛聯合國將一致歡迎英美力量在中東方面之建立。丘氏稱：英國目前無能力單獨維持中東方而之安定。渠總稱：「與英國權力之衰落俱來者，則為蘇聯之興起主張」。丘吉爾相信蘇聯將不致在最近將來以戰爭方式企圖實現其願望。據丘吉爾意見，蘇聯之願望為和平繁榮而非戰爭。丘氏繼指稱：「設無任何重大反對，蘇聯以將因外來之壓力及內在之共產黨陰謀而作嚴厲逼迫，如在外交方面蘇聯遭受抗拒，至可能與其有同等實力或較強實力之國家發生大戰之程度時，依余觀之，蘇聯在未來數年間，將不至嚴予而強行實現其政策及野心，致使事態頻於爆發點」。丘吉爾在結論中，籲請英語國家，對蘇聯在地中海之擴張，採取一致之政策。丘氏稱：「願吾人在完全諒解及好友情況下，並肩前進。如趨分裂，吾人全體或將遭支離毀減。如在世界組織下團結，吾人或可拯救自由文明及民主，甚或可使戰爭之罪惡永遠在人類面前絕跡」。如丘吉爾在第一篇論文中會檢討其在一九四四及一九四五年所執行之對希臘政策，渠認為當時渠執行之政策與兩年後之今日悶鍋以堅強之新年所採取者，如出一轍。</p>
<h3>美國代表屯　在希土兩國考察</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安哥拉十三日電〕美國民主黨參議員巴克萊昨日開羅低此，在招待記者會上發表談話稱：美國貸予希土二國之借款，或可於下週杪加以表決。巴克萊所率領之代表團，計有衆院民主與共和二黨議員四人，現正在希土二国考察，搜集關於兩鍋局勢之情形。各代表在招待記者會上皆力言美國援助希土二國並無帝國主義之目的。略謂：美國並無筧取政治或經濟特權之意，此可以美國之對華政策為例證。美國唯一之願望乃在協助復興希土二國之經濟，以穩定其政治局勢，此為維持世界和平所必要之措施。共和黨代表復力　必須遏阻蘇聯勞力之膨脹。略謂：蘇聯在歐洲所併吞之領土，已較任何控制國家為多，且在亞洲雖參戰際，故　宜遏阻其擴張勢力云。聞該代表團將於明日赴斯丹埠，然後前往希臘。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約十二日電〕國務院今日例行對蘇聯播音中有一幾年故羅斯福總統節目，由羅斯福夫人向蘇聯發表演說，略謂：「希望貴國戰時蒙受之可怖破壞，迅速恢復，其與敝國人民共同奮鬥戰勝侵略者所應用博得之酬報，亦盼將能收穫」。</p>

<h3>杜魯門聲望日高　獲多數人民愛戴</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統今已步入第三年頭，其聲望日隆，國內大部分人士已支持其新外交政策與中間路线之內政。杜氏在執政初期聲望日下，至去年十月時贊成其政策者僅百分之三十二，次月共和黨又在過會獲勝。自此依賴，杜魯門已恢復其以往聲望。最近民意測驗，表示有百分之六十均贊同其措施。杜氏之所以重獲人民變幻莫測愛戴者，大部分歸功於（一）聲敗煤礦工人領袖路易斯，使其不得不就範，而結束其反對政府管理廣場之罷工；（二）中間路线之內政政策；（三）任命馬歇爾為國務卿；（四）訪墨西哥之成功。杜氏阻止共產主義蔓延之計畫，該正為國會所支持。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議成敗關鍵　德國賠償問題剖視</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>這次在莫斯科舉行的四強外長會議，雖已德國問題為中心，但這次會議不至於會產生對德合約。四強外長至多對德國趨向統一抑或長期分裂的問題獲得一種決定，甚至連這一次收穫說不定也不能得到。</p>
<p>聯合國的外交官們堅持四強在決定未來的德國問題以前，必先對當前的德國問題成立協議。廿一個月以來使聯合國的佔領政策意見分歧的爭端，將為莫斯科會議之討論重心。</p>
<p>英美要求將德國立即實行經濟合併的建議，將遭蘇聯和法國的反對。蘇聯堅持必先自德國獲得一百億美元的賠償。法國主張先成立一個軟弱的中央政府，使德國形成一種非嚴格的聯邦制。</p>
<p>其他的窒礙尚有肅清納粹思想，解除武裝，和民主化散打難題。柏林的聯合國管制委員會已經化費了一年半的時光討論這些問題，最近終於宣佈它不能獲得解決。在四強意見趨於一致以前，對德合約的議訂決不能有多大的進展。</p>
<p>德國經濟統一　美方企望最切</p>
<p>德國的經濟合併是美國務卿馬歇爾在莫斯科會議中所企求的第一個目標。美國以將此問題列為莫斯科會議議程中最重要的一個問題，有下述四種重要的理由：第一，美國相信德國倘長此分裂下去，那麼東西兩集團間的衝突不免會引起又一次的世界大戰。經濟合併如果在延不下實現，德國將趨向永久的分裂狀態，使歐洲分成兩大集團，爭相為德國人抱腰。第二，此種局面演變下去，德國納粹或許會巧力名目，死灰復燃。德國的國家主義者正利用聯合國分歧的弱點和一般民衆對國家四分五裂的怨望。　然思動，同時德國經濟的停滯和食糧的匮乏孕育着依然散佈在各處的納粹思想，第三，由於各佔領區間存在着的壁壘，使製造商不能獲得原料，製成品不能流入尋常的市場，因此阻礙了工業的復興。此外，糧食，勞力和資本都被封鎖在各佔領區內。第四，德國西部需要英美經濟上的補助和原料的供給。最近合併英美兩個佔領區本年度的輸入總額在六億美元以上，外加佔領軍的維持費約十億美元。</p>
<p>英美兩國先前會主張德國實行經濟合併，理由是這樣可以減輕他們的財政負担。從蘇聯佔領區獲得的勝餘食糧和原料可以幫助復興德國西部的工業。這情形在目前還是存在着的，不過範圍小了些；因為蘇聯索取賠償的結果，減少了德國東部的出口勝餘物資。</p>
<p>美國相信，如果西方國家同意蘇聯自德國經常生產獲得賠償，則西方國家的支出勢必增加，而從德國合併所能獲得的這些財政上的利益，是比較的微細的。除非英美接受蘇聯的賠償要求—至少接受一部分，蘇聯不至於要贊同德國的經濟合併。</p>
<p>因此，賠償問題變成了莫斯科會議成敗的關鍵。蘇聯在莫斯科會議中最大的目標將是從德國西部獲得一部分的製成品。</p>
<p>蘇聯亟需物資彌補生產不足</p>
<p>蘇聯急切需要消費品，機器，和運輸工具，以修復希特勒車隊所破壞的一切設備，根據波茨坦協定，確保佔領區內的工廠已經大規模移往蘇聯，同時蘇聯正從留存在德國東部的工廠的經常生產裏榨取賠償。</p>
<p>因為蘇聯拒絕接受經濟合併辦法，至今還沒有從德國西部獲得一些賠償。照波茨坦協定的規定，德國西部拆除的工廠中四分之一應歸蘇聯所有，供蘇聯本國或波瀾應用。可是在實行合併以前，英美兩鍋還不會把任何工廠設備運出他們的佔領區。截止目前位置，德國西部的工廠已經拆除的還不到百分之一。</p>
<p>蘇聯官方現在主張德國應實行經濟合併，但是第一，他們要求英美咱如同自經常生產中取得賠償的原則。其次，蘇聯欲得到德國西部充量的製成品，以彌補今後五年至十年中國內生產量的不足。蘇聯要求的賠償合計一白億美元，比較波茨坦協定所允許的數量大約增加兩倍至三倍。</p>
<p>預料英美在莫斯科會議中取得賠償的辦法。連續實行多年以後，可能使德國和西方國家的大部分毛衣永遠被蘇聯所奪去。</p>
<p>美國唯恐充到一九二〇年以後的覆轍，那時美國貸款德國幫助德國的經濟建設，結果由於賠償的負担而迫使德國趨向通貨膨脹，經濟破產和國家主義之途。</p>
<p>美國過會領袖們反對任何足以增加佔領美軍用的賠償計畫。他們主張德國的出口貨應先用以支付英美運往德國的糧食和原料的代價。</p>
<p>發過在莫斯科會議中料將支持蘇聯自經常生產中取得賠償的要求。法國目前寗取煤臾製造品而捨棄拆除的工廠，因為目前缺乏技術人員，工人和原料，非在很久之後，這些工廠設備是無法使用的。</p>
<p>英美認為法蘇所堅持的原則將使德國工業回復到達較波茨坦會議所預定者為高的水準，足以加深德國重行武裝的危險。數年以後，德國對市場的競爭將更激烈。但是德國的鄰國如蘇聯等，對於本國當前的經濟困難比較這些未來的問題更為關切。</p>
<p>葛雷折衷方案　或可打開僵局</p>
<p>德境美軍司令葛雷中將對馬歇爾提供一種折衷變法如下：蘇聯如有降低他的要求。供給美國所需要的原料，並且贊同德國的經濟合併，那麼英美不仿接受自經常生產取得賠償的原則。</p>
<p>馬歇爾在莫斯科會議中大約將在蘇聯的主張和美國國會的見解中間尋求妥協。一種近似葛雷建議的辦法或許將被提出，作為解決賠償問題和經濟合併問題的基礎。果然如此的話，則死過外長貨將討論簽訂德國合約的程序。</p>
<p>但如果莫斯科會議對於合約的任何條款不至會成立協議是可以斷定的。再次局面下，馬歇爾料將很快地借宿會議，讓他「冷落」若干時後在召集一次四強會議。那麼德國的分裂局面看來是要　日持久的了。</p>
<h3>美議員嚴辭指責　華萊士在英演說　調其缺乏愛國心圖企反對政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕前副總統華萊士之演說後，今日引起各主要參議員一致攻擊。共和黨參議外交委員主席范登堡稱：「美國人到外國去發表攻擊本國政府之言論，實為駭人聽聞。余以為重要事件，並非華萊士君一九四八年之行動，乃其一九四七年之行動」。此言顯指華氏可能參加明年總統競選運動而言。民主黨參議員福爾白來稱：「余不知其用意何在，此人之言論放佛在克里姆林宮起草」。共和黨參議員勞倍森稱：「本國要人往他國，嘗試勸告彼等反對其本國之政策，成何體統，余以為英國人不致受其愚弄」。共和黨參議員馬爾稱：「杜魯門總統應差池華萊士並不代表任何人，僅代表其所運帶的共產黨烏合之眾發言」。民主黨參議員喬治稱：「華萊士之態度對於我國政策的目標，大有損害。華某並不正確解釋美國人民之情緒，顯然不諒解其他同胞之思想」。</p>
<h3>華萊士談話　謂不擬領導新黨</h3>
<p>「聯合社英國史托克十三日電」美國前副總統華萊士到英以來作業再次間聯合國同志會發表第三次演說，聲明渠本人不致在美國領導第三黨運動。惟稱此以運動或者可由民主黨參議員裴柏出面領導，貝氏為一極優秀之自由主義參議員。或問渠是否有意於一九四八年以第三黨總統候選人資格出面精選，華氏答稱，各州選舉法已造成一種局勢，使第三黨無法得勢，因此之故，任何人均不敢輕於嘗試。惟余不以為此變成極端守舊，則新黨或可出頭，於一次選舉中取得相當勢力，下次選舉即有得勝希望。華氏預測莫斯科外長會議，如以基本問題而論，行將失敗，即將在日內瓦舉行之國際貿易預備會議亦不免失敗云。</p>

<h3>物價偷偷抬頭　油米雜糧領導漲風　綢莊南北貨店生意興隆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟緊急措施方案，把物價穩定了四十多天，本月份的最近幾天中，物價又在偸偸的抬頭了。當局也逐漸加以注意，機紙上「抑平」，「限價」等觸目驚心的名詞，再度與讀者相見，一般市民又開始感到恐懼和不安。</p>
<p>這一次領導「漲風」的是油米糧食。上月下旬，記者左近一家小米店，還用一丈餘高的紅紙，寫上「購買白米五斗，贈送麵粉　一斤」，張貼在大門口。昨天記者經過時，再一注意，那紅紙早已掃除的乾乾淨淨。南京路上的四大公司及其他綢布莊，南北貨店等各種商店，生意又突然興隆起來。主婦們到處在打聽日用品的價格，那一家沒有漲，或漲得少一點，趕快去買，多買一點。對於應付日用品漲風，她們在抗戰開始，到勝利後的今日，整整十年有零的經騐中，得到一個結論，就是「趕快買，儘量買，把所有的幣用光。」</p>
<p>食米　當局對食米已恨價十四萬元一担可是事實上十四萬元祇能買到最次等的碎秞米一担。上好的白粳，米店祇能應酬熟悉的老主顧，價格是當塲面議的，大概以十七萬至十六萬元最普通。門市出售的「高貨」也要十五萬元一担，次等也要十四萬六千元。這是昨天前天的行情，食油經限價二十五萬元一担後，油商們喊出不够成本的口號，一般醫園或兼售食油的雜糧店，打一斤生油仍要四千一二百元。</p>
<p>香烟　香烟也是漲得利害的一種，麻立斯香烟每包零售三千一百元，假使你每天吸一包，每月就消耗近十萬元了。黃錫包香烟在三日前賣一萬三千元一聽，昨天要一萬八九。三五牌原售二萬，也漲到了二萬八千元。自從美鈔黑市由一萬一千八百元漲到一萬六七千元後，「洋貨」也被人注意收購了，克寗奶粉一磅裝每耀二萬一千元，有經騐的奶粉老主顧還一致認爲「尙未漲足」。</p>
<p>西藥　西藥漲風也頗熾烈，記者昨晚八時向虹廟貼鄰一家藥房買片劑配尼西林，詢明瓶裝每十五片的價格是四萬元。迨十分鐘後，取得款來購買時，却又討價五萬了。非惟不承認十分鐘前講定的價錢，還說：「我們本來還不願意賣呢。」這簡直已到居奇暴利的地步了。</p>
<p>在電車中，記者聽到三個產業工人的談話。甲說：「昨天我從打浦橋呌黃包車到霞飛路，黃包車夫硬要三千元，二千五都不行。他說三千元不過二升米錢。」乙說；「是呀！生活指數凍結以後，工錢不漲了，物價却天天在漲，眞不懂市政府啥道理。」丙搖搖頭說：「這個月的津貼（即差額金），不知社會局怎樣算法，不要再來一個七萬三千元。」</p>
<p>一瓶配尼西林十分鐘兩個價</p>
<h3>現任警察人員規定緩徵範圍　滬師管區接奉指令</h3>

<h3>本報昨第二次星期廣播　李石曾講社會化問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座金都電台播送全日廣播節目，並請黨國元老李石會（見圖）播講「社會化的問題」。李氏不久前與林素珊女士結婚，婚後曾赴香港度蜜月，昨日偕林女士雙又蒞臨。其演詞全文如下：</p>
<p>「社會化的問題，可以說很簡單，亦可以說很繁複。去年二中全會及今年三中全會都曾有過關於社會化的提案，此外各種刋物各種報紙亦多有論述。現在於短時間內僅作簡單明瞭的說明。所謂社會化，就此三字的字面看，已可明瞭大意。惟社會化可從種種方面來說，種種方面來研究，試騐，實行。以小的而論，個人或個人的心理行爲也關係到社會化，可以說是個人社會化的問題。推而大之，</p>
<p>家庭經濟　政治文化都有社會化的問題，更擴大之，則爲世界的社會化。所以社會化的範圍極大，無斷不包。現在先講兩點：一是政治的社會化，二是經濟的社會化。大家知道政治與經濟是分不開的，現在全世界政治經濟制度分爲（一）私人資本制度，是一種經濟的也是政治的制度，實在已經是過去了的制度，至少在趨勢上已經是過去了。（二）</p>
<p>社會制度，這一種制度目前還祇在局部試騐，且有許多並非眞正的社會化，如蘇聯與以前希特勒德國的制度，就並非眞芷而是假的社會化，他們的制度毋寗說是國家主義，雖然行的是社會制度，但是把最高權力集中於國家。所以現在世界上祗有私人資本制度和國家制度。這兩種制度都不是我們所需要的。唯有眞正的社會制度才是最重要最前進最溫和的制度。社會無所不包，亦包括個人與國家，但應以社會爲最主要，社會性爲最主要。社會制度並不抹煞個人權利，但因個人離不開社會，故個人所需應有限度。同樣國家亦爲社會一部份，有其必須盡的責任，其一即爲國防。當然在達到世界真正社會化真正和平以後，</p>
<p>國防問題　可以減掉，但在今日即使聯合國的集體安全辦法，亦尙免不了國防，所以重工業必須由國家來做。其他種種經濟方面的建設也要集中於國家。社會化的意義，就是說在目前私人資本制度尙未完全過去，國家尙須投任國防任務之時，至少可以開始社會制度運動。孫中山先生的三民主義中民權主義屬於政治方面，民生主義則就是社會化的問題。民生主義與社會化有密切關係，孫先生說過民生主義就是社會主義，但是社會主義有種種，孫先生說的當然不是蘇聯式或德國式的，而是社會化的制度，社會化方式的主義，所以社會民生主義的註解。」</p>

<h3>與舒新城先生書</h3>
<p>— 劉柳影</p>
<p>——提供一些怎肅推動電化教育的愚見</p>
<p>六日晚上參與你們第二次的電化敎育座談會，聽到一些兒你們的談話。雖然是一些兒，但使我發生很大的感觸，覺得有好些話，如骨哽在喉，很想傾吐。然而始終沒有半可話者，是因爲你們談話的主題是要利用電影及幻燈片，以作「識字」運動；而我所想發表的却是另外一方面的，且說來話長，書面提供，似較適合，因此在這裏分別叙述；敬希指正，幸甚幸甚。</p>
<p>甲　推動教育性的影片</p>
<p>敎育性影片的利用：自從去年十一月十九日，行政院公佈：「修正進口貿易暫行辦法」之後，電化敎育的推進受到莫大的打擊，從事此一工作的各方而嘗盡了辛酸苦辣，費畫九牛二虎，向當局及各方面呼籲，電化敎育的整部工具雖然還未能達到順利進口的目的，敎育性的影片終於同年十二月二日獲由最高經濟委員會准予不歸入進口限額而可免稅進口了。我們的財力旣然是很有限，我們的物力旣然又因進口之不能順利，這一些兒的敎育性影片的進口旣然又是千辛萬苦而收獲得的，那麼，我們應得適應這樣的時勢，對於外來的敎育性片應予以充份的利用。</p>
<p>敎育性片的審定：我知道目前已經進口的大英百科全書課本的影片是有一百多種了，但英美出品課本影片和幻燈片的還有好幾家人家，筆者認爲應該組織個審定小組委員會，從這裏頭挑選應該口的若干類別。有了這個審定的目錄之後，進口商，代理人，和其他的電化敎育機育於採購之時，也可有一準繩，以免虛耗財力。</p>
<p>課本影片「敎本」的編譯：大英百科全書科本影片的敎本的編譯，中華書局轉由中國電影照相器材供應公司，已在與美方接洽之中。這一件事如能實現，對於該大英百科全書的課片影片的放映是有莫大的助力。有了這種譯本之後，放映時方有「二美俱，二難併」之感。對於英語程度較低的聽衆，該片可以無聲放映；同時敎師依據譯本而加以解述；這眞是最理想的事。此一辦法，比之在該片上改用國語錄音尤爲簡便經濟。當然，其他的敎育性片的錄音音或敎本的編譯都是値得考慮的。</p>
<p>影戲院應加映敎育性片：爲增加民衆的知識起見，這一點應設法使其實現的。學生入影戲院是件公認的事，在這種塲所使他們增加一點學識，也是娛樂不忘讀書。况且，入影戲院的也有失學之輩，這也可以使他們受點强逼敎育。這些話似乎近乎笑話，太不嚴肅了，但都是的確都是實情。</p>
<p>應設法使敎育當局認識敎育片：。這也是很蜇要，但被忽略了的。敎育當局，如校長，主任敎師等，倘然不懂得，或不知道敎育片是什麼一回事，那麼，他們就不會設法放映敎育片，他們領導下的學子便沒有機緣可以領略這種智識的寳庫了。</p>
<p>乙　電影與播音應該共同努力</p>
<p>電化敎育絕不是電影單方面的事，播音也佔着一個很重要的位置。中國的播音界已有相當悠久的歷史，且有相當的設備。可是對於電化敎育的推進，似未有相當令人滿意的貨獻。下列幾件事似乎是應該而且亟須使其實現的。</p>
<p>電化敎育擴大座談會：我們開過兩次談話會，參加的多是屬於電影方面的人士，因而討論的也是偏於這一方面的事。如要雙管齊下推動電化敎育，下一次，或以後，的座談似宜邀請播音界參加，共同討讑。</p>
<p>播音電台應使其學術化：要達到這個目的，最好是由幾家報館，出版人，學校，其他文化機關聯合起來，共同負起這一個責任。本年三月十七日起，申報創辦新聞廣播，每日三次，這是中國新聞界的新紀錄。近來的電台也有學術講座。但這一方向的空中文化廣播，似乎尙嫌太少。怎樣才可以使其更加擴大，而達到近乎「學術化」的理想是很値得商討的。</p>
<p>廣播與識字運動：利用廣播來作識字運動，似覺省力，收效宏大。報館或雜誌倘然是肯從事於這個運動，那麼隨時預爲登載一些廣播的文字，掃除文盲的目的，或許會得事半而功倍的收效的。</p>
<p>丙　從根本上打通推行電化教育的障碍</p>
<p>「修正進口貿易暫行辦法」是推行電化敎育最大的障碍。筆者在（敎育部社會敎育司與金陵大學合辦的）電影與播音月刋（第五卷八九期合刋）上有詳細的贅述。總而言之，凡有關於推動電化敎育的工具，除了書本之外，照這個暫行辦法，都是在禁止進口之列。（敎育性影片的進口的開放是最近的事。可是，有關於這一類的貨品所申請的外匯，仍然是無法獲得批准。——這是很令人費解的。）</p>
<p>這暫行辦法，倘然不亟予修改，電化敎育和「識字」運動都是無法順利進行的。這是根本上的障碍。我們必須打通這一個難關。我們應從這一個方向努力。</p>
<p>我們應用什麼的方式來達到這一個目標是很値得共同商討一下的。</p>

<h3>漢城隊旗開得勝三比一撃敗蘇聯</h3>
<p>韓國漢城足球隊遠征來滬，昨日首次出馬，第一仗對蘇聯隊，韓軍旗開得勝，以三比一擊敗蘇聯，上半時遠征軍二比一佔先。昨日下午逸國球塲，觀衆擁擠異常，爭先恐後，約計一萬五千餘人。韓僑後援會特組啦啦隊到塲，盛况空前。賽前漢城隊由李永善及申國權領導出塲，站立大看台前，韓啦啦隊高唱國歌並燃爆竹，以示鼓勵，四座後報以掌聲，情緒熱烈。</p>
<p>花園聯隊　先開紀錄</p>
<p>時問旣屆，蘇聯隊長勞勃司托夫獻花，客軍隊長朴奎楨接受。裁判張樂，巡邊鄧效良李國義登塲執法，展開惡鬥。漢城首先開球，鄭南湜撥動皮球來犯，鐵伏尼捷林考夫合力防禦，混戰至四分鐘時，漢城禹晶煥邊陲起義，鄧南湜獲球，初試脚頭，稍偏野逸。蘇聯策動反攻，鐵伏尼遙傳左角，諾高浴夫單刀直入，客軍後衛未防，遂爲所乘，一比零蘇聯佔得先着。客軍旣失首戰，心有不甘，金容植率衆來犯，禹晶煥右角切射，朱有收穫，金容植截得回球，用力再叩，柴哈洛夫接住，未生差池。</p>
<p>遠征軍　一球佔先</p>
<p>至十四分鈸時，小黃毛勞勃司托夫帶球竄入，千鈞一髮，朴大鍾鏟出，三分鐘後，捷林考夫禁區犯手球，金容植主罰十二碼，求勝心切，坐失良機。蘇聯反擊，卡普司汀獲沙華寗接濟，卅碼外猛射，車淳鍾躍起救出。未幾客軍前鋒，運用小派司，逼近蘇聯門前，於八碼處力射，應聲入網，一比一扳成和局。客軍得手，中衛前鋒，頓趨活躍，至卅二分鐘時鄭南湜中路突破，單騎深入，柴哈洛夫驚疑未定，球已中的，二此一客軍後來居上。嗣後客軍球勢益盛，惟不久上半時吿結束，僅城客軍以二比一領先。</p>
<p>下半時　客軍猛攻</p>
<p>檸檬過後，易陣再戰，蘇聯原陣未變，客軍吳景煥眼部受傷，改由安鍾秀上塲。接觸後，蘇聯力岡挽回，大事進攻，無奈客軍愈戰愈勇，中衛三將，前輸後送，頗見得力，蘇聯前鋒，雷池難越，勞勃司托夫，被金奎煥釘煞，無能爲九。至八分鐘後，客軍前鋒，又見猖獗，金容植禹晶煥迭次射門，柴哈洛夫高接低擋。備見辛苦，斯時蘇聯陣地幾全爲漢城所控制，良久圍解。</p>
<p>三比一　蘇聯受挫</p>
<p>至廿三分鐘，客軍閔丙大禁區手吻皮球，張樂判決十二碼，鐵伏尼操刀，球中門柱橫木彈出。未及三分鐘，蕯文效尤，禹晶煥回敬一蹴入網，三比一客軍又傳挺報。蘇聯要隘連失，急起反攻，奈勞勃司托夫孤掌　鳴，漢城俟攻勢一過，又來進犯，蘇聯陣內，形勢緊張，直至終塲，幸未再陷，迨法定時間已屆，銀笛長鳴，客軍以三比一擊敗蘇聯，首傳捷報。</p>

<p>九時牛，鳴笛開賽，靑白乙首採攻勢，經靈桂統率三軍進攻，鐵路腹地，敵騎縱橫，幸吳家邦岳仁孝徐晟源等，保護得力，未有差池，鐵路靜極思勁，蕭子文吳炳浩連轡並進，亦鮮效果，混戰多時，上半時即吿完畢，零比零各無建樹。</p>
<p>休息渦後，易地再戰，鐵路發動總反攻，靑白乙後防，備見緊張，張鳳崗，徐國福，左右招架，黃仕傑前後接應頗爲忙碌，混戰至廿八分鐘時，陸慶祥得林典羲之派司，近門力射，球出峻急，黃仕傑挽救不及，遂破網，一比零鐵路開紀錄。靑白乙猶圖反攻，奈鐵路監覦嚴密，無隙可乘，迨笛專用長鳴，鎮路以一比零勝青白乙，榮膺冠軍。</p>

<h3>女運動員特寫　女狀元劉珍寶</h3>
<p>威震江南的綠隊女籃球隊中，鼎鼎大名的健將除了黃明媛小姐外，就要　劉珍寳小姐了。劉小姐是女籃球員中的射籃神手，有投必中，和黃明媛可稱二難，互相媲美，每塲總是得分最高者。綠隊中間，同伴都稱她爲「女狀元，」這雅號圈內外人曉得的極少，但是，道「女狀元」也確有他的來歷。追溯往事，還遠在八年之前。</p>
<p>八年前往事</p>
<p>那是民國廿八年四月二日，靑年會體育部主辦男女投籃比賽，女子方面，參加者有八位英雌，結果劉小姐以六十七分居首位，於是女狀元的名稱，隨之產生，足見她的成就，並非一日之功。下面是當時比賽前四名的成績：</p>
<p>姓名　籃下　罰球　遠投　運擲　總分</p>
<p>劉珍寳　廿二　二四　六　十五　六七</p>
<p>李韞芝　廿一　一四　十五　十三　六三</p>
<p>王維珍　十八　二〇　三　十八　五九</p>
<p>汪印蘭　二六　一四　三　十一　五四</p>
<p>看了上面的一段球塲往事，我們明白了「女狀元」的來歷。劉小姐本屆在綠隊中，由後衛改打前　後，每塲獲分，總是最多的一位，原來－她的射籃之神妙，八年之前早已驚人的了。除了劉珍寳外，李輟芝，王維珍，汪印蘭，都了綠隊的大將，人才濟濟，無怪綠隊稱雄上海，無出其右的。</p>
<p>有兩種風度</p>
<p>多少她是帶着一點南國姑娘的姿態，不說你是不會曉得的，她原是廣東籍啊，但是，也有人說她具有南方人的柔態，她是從小生養在南方的，換句話說，她是具有兩種風度的一位姑娘。你瞧，她帶着微長的臉兒，圓圓而有神的烏眼，確是南國姑娘的象徵。至於她的個性呢，則可以說完全是「靜」「柔」兩字。普通人以爲運動員應該是動　，剛的，而她却是適得其反。這樣一位溫和柔靜的小姐，誰料她會是馳騁球塲上的一員女將呢！</p>
<p>生活及消遣</p>
<p>當然——大家知道她是啓秀的高材生，因她在籃球上就是當年代表啓秀隊揚威滬壖而成名的，啓秀畢業以後，她進滬江大學，所以二年前，帶上了方帽子，現在是在母校（啓秀中學部）担任英文敎師，除諄諄授課之外，她的課餘消遣，便是和綠隊幾位同伴練球，以及參加比賽，此外，她就喜歡看影戲，還有對於攝影一道，也是很有興趣的。劉小姐的生活和消遣，可稱得上是極正當的一位。</p>
<p>在提携後起</p>
<p>綠隊有一位新進仁寶小姐的，面部和態度，很像她，大家最初都以爲是她的妹妹，本屆出塲後，才知道不是，徐小姐很有志於籃球，所以三年如一日的跟着她看球，練球。劉小姐也始終不倦的指示她，敎授她，徐小姐現在已經隸籍於綠隊了，我想在女狀元訓練下，異日的成就，倒是在意料之中。</p>
<p>喜事在眉前</p>
<p>筆者曾幾次探詢她的喜事，終是回答「還早」，據悉：劉小姐已得了如意對象，而且喜期已在不遠。女球員一結婚，大都隱退家居，錄隊當然要受到嚴重的損失，同時球迷，也將看不到「女狀元」的神射技術了，然而——她提携徐小姐，後起有人，也正是她的一番苦心呀！（愛萃）</p>

<h3>四聯總處規定定各行局　協助採購供應物品</h3>
<p>當局前爲抑平物價，下令金融界協助辦理。四聯總處當即規定各行局放敎業務，配合民生日用必需品供應辦法，協助推進方案，運用各行局現有分支機構，協助採購供應物品，俾協助暢通運輸，疏導貨源。此項辦法已經四聯總處理事會通過，茲探錄其辦法如后：（一）供應機關向各產區及各生產事業訂購產品時，得洽請車業行局，以押匯方式優先貸助。（二）供應機關因自行訂購配給物品，需款週轉時，得洽請專業行局以押匯方式優先貸助。（三）各行局承做此項押匯時，應盡量設法便利，並注意下列各點，（甲）押匯期限，視運輸途程之長短酌定之，（乙）押匯折扣，應酌予放寬。（丙）各種貨運憑單及應備文件，力求簡單，免除盛複。（丁）在可能範圍內，代辦貨物保險及其他必要手續。（四）向各行貸款之公營民營交通事業，對供應物品之購銷運輸，應切實配合協助，並照下列各點辦理。（甲）以一定運量分配承運供應物品，（乙）以最低廉之運價承運供應物品，（丙）以最優先之日期承運供應物品。</p>
<h3>工商輔導處討論　紙類輸入限額問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工商輔導處近爲本市造紙原料之供應問題，曾迭次召集各紙廠談話，關於紙類之輸入限額分配問題，據紙業會員廠表示：二至四月之外匯限額，紙類爲三，四六〇，〇〇〇美元。其中捲烟紙八十萬元，報紙二百萬元，木漿三十五萬元，雜件三十萬元。據云：此種分配辦法，係根據民國二五－二六年及去年之統計。但十年前本國造紙業情形，與今逈不相同。且去年因外貨傾銷（輸入紙類約十萬餘噸），各廠多數停工。益以敵僞紙漿之拋售，故紙漿之輸人數量甚少，依以爲據，不甚合理。茲經各方磋商結果，認爲下列辦法，有予以考慮之價値：</p>
<p>（一）下次輸入限額，對紙類結匯，予以放寬。</p>
<p>（二）如結匯限額無法放寬，則下述各項，可以酌量採納：</p>
<p>（乙）本市捲烟紙存貨，可供數月之用，暫時可以減少輸入量，因民豐紙廠，現在每年能產三萬捲，僅合消耗量四分之一。七月份可以增產一倍，此後捲烟紙之進口，每年可以二千噸爲限度。</p>
<p>（甲）報紙之輸入，可改爲木漿。因一噸木漿，可製二噸報紙。故以同額之外匯，在本國製造可得二倍之報紙，旣有利於文化事業，又可節省外匯。二百萬元美金，可定紙漿約一萬噸。每月可得三千噸左右。對各紙廠之原料，供應不無少補。而各紙廠之工作，亦不至陷於停頓之境矣。</p>
<p>（丙）雜件紙類，大部可以自製，宜嚴格限制，以充紙漿輸入之用。</p>
<p>此外造紙必需之毛毯，及銅絲布，亦須仰賴舶來品。毛毯本國雖有製造者，但其耐用性，祗合外國貨三分之一。而銅絲布則非設法輸入不可。</p>
<h3>中合訂定　分支庫等級</h3>
<p>中央合作金庫在全國各地分佈七處分庫及九處支庫，最近該庫爲求管理上之便利，特將各地分支庫暫行訂定三種等級。一等分庫計有上海東北河北湖北等四分庫。二等分庫暫缺。三等分庫計有河南北平山東等三分庫。一等支庫僅靑島支庫一處。二等支庫暫缺。三等支庫計有徐州淮陰蚌埠泰縣錦州遼陽安東樊城等八支庫。此外該庫尙擬在無錫蕪湖二處谷設一三等支庫。短期內即可成立。揚州東台屯溪等各省較大之地方，各設一分理處，藉以促進各地之合作事業云。</p>
<h3>海味桂圓北貨三業與南貨業發生糾紛</h3>
<p>本市海味北貨桂圓三業，突於本月十二日起，拒絕南貨業進貨，並派糾察隊在小東門市場中拒絕南貨業到二三樓接洽交易及檢查貨車等情事，引起極大風波，緣南市小東門中華路上海市糖海南北雜貨同業聯合市塲，原爲上海糖海味北貨南貨等業買賣貨物集合埸所，因南貨業向前三業購貨，例付十日期支票名爲鏣期（即介款）亦經四業議決行之攸久。茲前三業忽決議通知南貨業，一律現款交易，但南貨業方面認爲如用現款，不但剝削利益，且關於旣定物價有莫大影響。聞南貨業方面，已定各就店中存貨售完停業外，並請各主管機關救濟云。</p>
<h3>日本擴充生產　我紡織業危殆</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕我紡織業近又面臨一新危機，經濟當局正籌設救濟中。據某經濟權威吿記者，日本紡織業現有紗錠三百萬枚，較我目前所有之一百四十萬錠已多數倍，最近日本又高呌紡織業爲其生命綫，盟軍總部亦有意將其錠數自三百萬增至六百萬，此事果實現，對我基礎脆弱之紡織業，實爲幕大打擊。首次大戰後，日棉獨佔東亞市塲故事，勢將重演。當局對此極注意，近曾開會商討，可能與盟軍總部洽商，設法阻止。又一可能採取之步驟，爲提高紡織品進口稅率。至獎勵土棉生產。過去即極注意，今後當更重視。</p>
<h3>葵扇產價飛漲</h3>
<p>夏令所用之葵扇，大部產自廣東，今年以產稀銷旺，價格飛漲。頃自某粵商探悉，今年葵扇價格，較去年上漲甚劇，蓋產地新會，今年所產數址，祗及去年三分之一，而銷路之旺，却爲近年所罕見。同時，又悉於勝利前，敵偽曾禁止人民植葵，如欲恢復戰前產量，至少須在五年以後云。</p>
<h3>菸葉去旺價揚</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨市靑州·許州·鳳陽·桐城·新昌·四都·桐鄕·宿松·等菸葉，業已砌升。據業中人談：烟葉以烟廠實銷較好，納胃較旺，復以水脚運費稅繳頻頻增加，漲勢尙在開端。</p>
<p>襄許烟葉成本加重</p>
<p>〔又訊〕近來許州菸葉價格逐節上漲，其原因聞係許昌當地價提高，故上海亦隨之增加。現據熟悉內容研究有素者談論，謂襄許烟葉本來摻雜頗多，近由該地縣政府貨物稅局。菸行公會。及菸產改進處等各機關聯合取締，菸行進貨認眞，所以該處菸葉把子淸純，不再摻雜，且能久藏不壞，雖經黃霉節令，不致變質，惟因選揀精嚴成本加重，價格自應提高。但現在上海市面之許葉，均係調整以前運來，其中皆有摻雜之貨，且所含水份甚多，一至夏令，有發霉變色之患，故各廠商咸有戒心，不敢多進，雖則喊價甚高，惟成交者寥寥無幾云。</p>
<h3>國產針織品　南洋銷路略好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市針織業某領袖人士昨語記者：國產針織品自外匯率調整後，外銷情形，已轉活躍，去路以南洋爲主。據佔計：近兩月來每月南銷之數額，襪子約十萬打，內衣約六萬打。運銷到潤，以裝往香港及菲律賓方面者，尙有薄利可岡。裝往新加坡暹羅等地者，全無利潤可言。目前客商正在試探裝運，希望能恢復戰前國產針織品在南洋一帶運銷之市塲。據統計：目前南銷數額，尙不及戰前南銷旺季時十分之二，亟望有關方面，對該業之外銷事宜，予以切實之援助及推動。至該業前會聯合若干棉紗複　業公會，共組棉紗複製業外銷聯營當公司之事，刻仍在籌劃階段。聞公司之目的，亦無非在以同業集體之力量，謀以裝成品向國營紗廠易取棉紗棉綫，屬於代理製造性質，其成品交由公司作有計劃之輸出。惟以茲事體大，牽涉範圍頗廣，刻尙在積極徽收各關係方而意見中。一俟時機成熟，當再計劃成立云。</p>
<h3>尼隆車胎</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十一日電〕固特異橡皮車胎公司最近製造一種車胎，純用尼隆綫織成。據稱此種車胎之强度較其他任何車胎大百分之六十。此外，車胎套係用六縐尼隆製成，使車胎較輕而又較堅牢，惟因尼隆目前缺貨，故該公司暫時僅製造大型汽車所用之純尼隆車胎。</p>
<h3>中國蠶絲公司　召開座談會</h3>
<p>研究貸款及收蘭問題</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國蠶絲公司草擬之本年度　絲產銷計劃，自呈送農林部轉行政院核示後，迄未批下。惟江浙兩省之收繭時間，刻江蘇僅餘四十五日，浙江僅餘一月，爲謀爭取時間，先作準備計，該公司特於昨日上午十時，召集江浙兩省蠶絲關係方面，舉行座談會。出席中蠶公司葛敬中，湯錫祥，江蘇省政府代表周元功，浙江省政府代表蔣師琦，第三區經絲公會褚輔成，冷禦秋，王化南，沈九如，中農行陶菊如等，討論迄十二時許散會。當決定另組小組會議，自下週起，連續舉行會議十日，共同研討春蠶貸款，收繭，開設繭行等等準備工作，以利本年度產銷計劃之推進云。</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州電〕蘇省府鑒於最近物價又趨波動，爲謀加強控制，特決定成立全省經濟彙報處，頃急電京滬綫各縣，飭將米油麵粉柴紗等日用品價格昇降情形，於每週三週六　實呈報，遇有激烈變動，尤須隨時電請核示。</p>
<h3>春季呢羢市面回顧　三個月來貨價節節上升</h3>
<p>七年一月中旬適値舊臘年底，呢羢市面平庸，進出交易更寂。除花呢類趨堅，人心看好外，餘無上落。大衣呢因實銷時季已逝，下跌尤重。二十七日係舊曆新正初六，紅盤開出，平均上漲一分半鈿。一般貨主鑒於政府管製進口之嚴厲，外匯難以配得，定貨困常異常，廠方開盤，節節提高。及至二百五十及五百關金票發行，盛傳外匯調整，日用品物價先後飛漲，呢羢新交易雖較往年爲少，人心則頗向榮。</p>
<p>綜觀三十五年呢羢商業，廠家賺錢最爲豐厚，棋盤街帮盈餘亦屬不弱，字號帮除協大有相當賺錢外，餘均以不遭虧本爲幸運，大牛祗成紙上當貴，蓋其利益多消耗於高利貸之途矣。二十八日春和永被竊花呢，計損失一千二百萬元之譜，亦可見時値之一斑。</p>
<p>三月初，呢羢貨價無不全部上漲。利買消息旣盛，廠方居奇扳俏，五日，關稅附加百分之五十後，市氣更昂。同時黃金美票在漲，物價一致上揚，呢羢自亦不能例外。十七日美匯由三三五〇調整至一萬二千元，呢羢所受直接影響頗大，零躉行情因此更進一層，雖經政府規定黃金四百八十萬由國行收兌，並竭力穩定物價，然市上各貨仍明挺暗秀。二十二日毛織物類暫時禁止進口令公佈後，業中人心又起恐慌，一般進口行商均陷於停頓之途，所有製造呢羢之各廠商，莫不乘機而起，有如天之驕子，盤價狂跳。呢羢同業店號，莫不以廠商之馬首是瞻，鑒於進貨不易，居奇扳俏，零　市價步步高升。</p>
<p>回顧當時實銷方面，本客各方因天氣寒冷，尙少活動。除麥爾登外，頗少大批成交。兼以高利貸之可怕，不敢再行嘗試。加以一路飛漲太速，花色殘缺不全，吃本加重，轉週困難。購買方國，在目下生活程度高壓下，其有能力添製曰萬元一套西裝，四五十萬元一件袍料者，究竟亦屬少數。故呢羢業現在之趨勢，無非貨缺價昂，進出艱苦耳。</p>
<p>上月中承前月之漲風餘威，由始至終，依然處於上漲之途。防雨布因實銷相繼當令，兼以整理費及紗價增貴關係，每碼由一萬二三千元步漲至一萬七八千元。夏貨開價奇昂，英製凡立丁每碼齊喊二十三五萬元，本廠貨十五六萬元，章華派力司售十四萬元。至實地成交則均無幾，因本客諸買方不但嫌價貴，且以離實銷之期尙有待也。然花呢宣維類行情，則已步高不少，淡色呢羢頗形軋缺暢銷，本街各帮及南京帮需要均殷。同一質地之貨品，只因深淺顏色關係，其售價相差往往至三五千元一碼。茲將一月十五日至三月十五日春季呢羢標準行情刋列於後：</p>

<h3>陳毅生死之謎　津浦路中段打通後的魯共動態</h3>
<p>— 濟南五日航訊　本報特派員覆天</p>
<p>儘管中共一再宣稱：津浦路徐濟段及其以西地區乃係共軍自動作戰略的放棄，但無論如何，徐濟段打通及王耀武王敬久兩路國軍，會師乃是鐵一般的事實。隨着徐濟段的打通，整個山東局勢已邁入一新的階段，國軍的次一攻擊目標自然是風殲沂蒙山區共軍的主力及隨着圍殲俱來的必要行動之一的膠濟鐵路的再打通。（至少先打通濟南至張店淄博段）。</p>
<p>魯共部署及企圖</p>
<p>兵家云：「知己知彼，百戰百勝。」値得注意的是自二月下旬魯中戰役以來陳毅在淄川舉辦了一個軍官訓練團，將警共師長以下排長以上分期調團受訓，每期十天，一個多月來已將所有幹部訓練完畢，同時其在魯南魯中魯西諸役所遭受的損失亦已整補就緒。截至目下止，魯共動態，可分三方面說明如下；</p>
<p>（一）濟南外團：包括張店以西，蒙陰大汶口以北禹城以南，津沛路以西地區。計共駐有共軍十四個師三個旅合約廿萬人。（地方部隊及民兵未列入。）其分駐情形如下：新一師駐張店以東；第二師第四師駐張店周村間；解七師駐明水郭店間；解十一師駐章邱；第六師駐淄川；解三師駐萊蕪；解四解九師警一旅駐泰安東范家鎭一帶，解八師駐新泰附近，警二旅駐泰山及其以北；第一師一部駐徂徠山，一部駐費縣以北；第七師新七師新十一師駐蒙陰。至黃河以北，除地方團隊外，現僅禹城附近駐警六旅，原駐齊河西壽張間劉伯誠部主力於三月廿三日已西竄豫北，正向道淸鐵路發動攻勢，企圖橫貫豫北，西入晋南與由陝北退入晋西之彭德懷賀龍所部會攻山西。　以上地區共軍因攻擊濟甫屢遭頓挫後，乃變更戰勝改將主力集中於萊蕪，新泰，范家鎭，洋流店地區，其可能行動，不外：</p>
<p>1進出泰山徂徠山之間，截斷徐濟段交通，切斷國軍南北兩兵團之連絡。</p>
<p>2重下魯南蘇北，襲擊國軍大後方。</p>
<p>3保持機動，側擊由臨沂北進國軍。</p>
<p>（二）昌濰地區：在昌樂濰縣安邱外圍共軍，亦因屢攻受挫現僅剩警五旅及民兵等，已不足慮，而其主力約三萬據本月二，四，兩日所得報吿，已調沂水東南，似有側襲臨沂再下蘇北企圖。</p>
<p>（三）靑島外圍：除原有之解五解六師警三警四旅及濱海獨立第一，二，三團，濱北獨立第一，二，三團膠南縱隊及民兵外，近又自烟台調來二萬餘，同時烟台至即墨以北靈山間公路已被修通，由烟台東至威海衛，西至昌邑間沿海公路亦被修通並進而延修至小淸河口之羊角溝，察其企圖，一方固在防阻國軍海軍登陸所以便於兵力之調動，一方亦所以對靑島造成威　態勢，惟　島國軍兵力難薄，但消極的保衛尙是綽有餘裕的。</p>
<p>戰鬬序列的重編</p>
<p>隨着「中共革命軍事委員會」將八路軍易名爲「中國人民解放軍」，其在山東原歸陳毅所指揮的新四軍等自三月起亦一律改稱爲「華東人民解放軍」，又稱「華東野戰軍，」仍以陳毅爲司令員，而以粟裕張鼎丞爲副司令員，原任新四軍第四師師長張愛萍調任參謀長，除原有政委饒激石蟬聯外，並增調新四軍第六師師長譚震林爲政委，政治部主任則改以鄧子明鍾奇光担任。原有的新四軍各師及各解放師，新編師，警衛旅等番號一律取消而改設十個縱隊，每縱隊轄三個師，師轄三個團，另有特務團，敎導團砲兵團各一，每縱隊人數約三萬至三萬五千名。其總兵力除民兵外，因劉伯誠主力西調，現共約三十五萬人。（各戰役損失已整補齊全。）</p>
<p>放棄論祇是烟幕</p>
<p>上（三）月十五日上午，國軍某部在周村車站以南的尙莊附近發現有二輛吉普車，一輛轎車，另外還有二輛中型日本卡車，正由東向西行進，顯然這是魯共首腦人物坐的車輛，當予掃射襲擊。事後，消息傳來，陳毅正坐此車，一彈由陳之肩部射入，脅部穿出，已於十七日即因傷重斃命，一說十九日斃命，淄川大碳地華東野戰軍司令部及博山山頭莊僞省府都嘗開過規模宏大的追悼會。而保定綏靖公署所抓得俘虜的口供中，竟謂：看到第一八五三號陝北出版建國日報，其中載有朱德悼陳毅一文，但令人懷疑的是那位俘　看報時竟能運該日報紙發刋號數能牢牢記住，而近有由魯中逃來濟南者又說陳毅於最近嘗出席某項果會並講過話。於是，若千觀察家便認爲這是共軍有意以誤傳誤，將假作眞。道正如共軍邇來有意編造「放棄關內，收復關外，」「放棄山東，不放棄山東靑年」等口號以期鬆懈國軍鬥志，如出一轍，這實在値得國軍高度警覺。證之魯共將原在魯中掠奪的物資雖多運屯黃河以北的渤海軍區，但其部隊不僅不北調，且多南調，並集中於新泰，蒙陰，沂水一帶，修復沿海公路，烟台至即墨間公路，益都至沂水間公路，以便利其補給及行軍，可知其企圖不小，而初無放棄山東的跡象可尋，所調放棄，實在只是一種烟幕，因在戰略上只有在確保山東的大前題下，共軍始可隨時再下魯南，重竄蘇北。</p>
<p>華南梟雄之末日</p>
<p>（上）在華南曾橫行一時之日本戰犯田中一，在行刑前遊街示衆。（下）田中雙膝跪地，咬緊牙關，一副猙獰的面孔，等候死神降臨的剎那。（李景開攝）</p>
<h3>請看華南頭號戰犯的下塲　田中久一伏誅</h3>
<p>— 四月二日廣州航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>三月廿七日，這是廣州人一個最痛快的日子，尤其是淪陷時期在廣州的民衆，他們數年來壓抑在心頭的仇恨，今天都消失了！因爲一度雄據華南兩年多的日戰犯華南派遣軍司令官兼香港總督的陸軍中將田中久一，就在當天的下午，明正典刑了！</p>
<p>大約是三時二十分左右，廣州行轅的軍事法庭軍法檢察官蔡麗金，偕書記官和翻譯官曾廣科升堂，把田中提了上來；那時田中穿着很整齊的軍服，戴着軍帽，架起近視眼鏡，手上還拿着拉鍊的黃色皮袋，脚上的黃皮鞋，擦得挺亮，一進法庭門口，把軍帽脫下，向法官一鞠躬；當法官宣讀其罪狀之後，問他有什麼遺言，他祗請求將他的遺物，寄返日本他的家屬，以外並無其他了。在表面看來，他知道了死刑將要執行，還是很鎭定的，雖然他面色的蒼白，顯露了若干憂鬱的情緒，但仍看不見他膝蓋的顫抖，大概他也自知罪惡貫盈，遲早終有這麼一天吧！</p>
<p>在騐明正身之後，翻譯官曾廣科替他找來了一些日本的用具，給了他一杯日本酒和一支日本香烟，這便是他最後的受用。</p>
<p>一切例行乎續辦完了，便由憲兵廿六團執行任務，把他押上了一幗大卡車，在「槍決日戰犯華南最高指揮官田中久「中將」的白布條幅下，遊行示衆，卡車過處，萬人空巷，爭看這巨魔的面目，沿途民衆無不額手稱慶，他們絮絮談着淪陷時我們同胞受他茶毒的慘痛往事，咬牙切曲地，似乎這深仇大恨還沒有消滅！</p>
<p>行刑的地點，是在市郊流花橋刑塲，田中在兩位憲兵押持下軍，背東向西的行了十多步，這時不容許他再鎭定了，大約人在生死之間的剎那，總難免會有點畏怯，那時他將牙根咬得緊緊，充份顯露了他原來那副猙獰的回目；四時十六分，監斬官一聲號令，田中久一雙膝跪下，射手以步槍正向田中的後心，砰然一聲，田中便仆成一字，射手再補上三槍，祗見那他那黃絨的軍服，被鮮血染得一片紅色，這個好戰的一代梟雄，於焉終結，這正是　武者的！個下塲。</p>

<p>南市改善火政芻議</p>
<p>編者先生：此次南市火災，被害者大半爲貧苦之棚戶，良以建築材料均是易於着火之物，加之密築一隅，故一旦着火，不可收拾。且南市太平龍頭類多損壞，雖有救火車，亦無用武之地，經此大火，本可懲前毖後，設法改善，豈知棚戶仍在原處搭蓋，於是正式居戶，均岌岌自危，深恐一且火起，又蹈前轍，深希當局作曲突移薪之計，勸棚戶移至郊外，如南車站一帶，健有空地，一面添修水管，改善消防設備，事關公衆安寗與市容觀瞻，請貴報披露，促市政當局採納。（南市一居民上）</p>
<p>棉價狂漲請速抑平</p>
<p>編輯先生：前月物價空前暴漲，幸賴政府實施經濟緊急措施，方將各物抑平，然爲時未幾而棉價騰漲不已，按吾通粗絨二月初（每担價）僅十八萬元，後在金潮期中一度高達四十四萬元，旋因經濟緊急措施方案實施，曾抑低至三十五萬元，詎知轉瞬之間，竟又出現五十三萬之新高峯，按棉花爲農產品，價高固可增加農民收益，但棉價旣高，紗布成本激增，而紗布又爲日常所必需之主要商品，其影響民生自不待言。且較之其他主要商品－如米糧等物顯顯已失其平衡（按二月初白米八萬元現僅十一萬元）此種畸形狀態，若竟任其自然，而不設法消除，將來勢必牽動其他物價，應速予制止。（唐家閘姜曉巒）三，五。</p>

<h3>日本賠償問題的檢討</h3>
<p>— 趙南柔</p>
<p>戰敗國向戰勝國賠償，是人類自有戰爭以來的通例，特別是侵略的戰敗國須對被侵略的戰勝國賠償，更是情理所常然。只是關於賠償的主義，懲膺賠償與損害賠償之分，而後者又有完全賠償與不完全貽償之分；就賠償的方法說，則有金錢賠償與實物賠償的區別。關於戰敗後的日本的賠償，聯合國所採的主義與方法，首先可從波茨坦宣言中找出牠的根據，宣言中說：『日本可被准許足以維持其經濟並支付公正之實物賠償之工業，但決不包括能藉以武裝再起之工業。』根據這個旨趣，美國在一九四五年九月發表的初期對日方針中說：『對於維持日本之和平經濟以及對佔領軍之供義上，並非必要之一切物資及工業施設，應予拆除。』又說：『凡與日本非軍事化之計劃相矛盾，或足以使此計劃發生障礙之賠償，不應實行。』根據同樣的旨趣，中國王外長於一九四五年九月在倫敦時曾說：「中國希望先沒收日本國內及中國東北之日本工塲，由此中取得賠償。』其後於翌年九月滯留巴黎時又說：「中國在戰時雖蒙受軍大損失，但不提出超過日本償付能力之賠償要求，起草和約時，中國不取報復政策。「可知無論波茨坦宣言，美國或中國的方針，都不取懲膺主義，而採取不完全的賠償主義，這是因爲採取超過日本償付能力的懲膺主義，徒足遭致日本人民的反感，採取完全的損害賠償，也非日本的償付能力所及。同時，不採取金錢賠償，而採取實物賠償的方法，這是因爲金錢賠償缺少確實性，第一次世界大戰後德國的賠償便足以證明，並且金錢賠償不能制限賠償國的工業生產，仍有武裝再起之虞；反之，實物賠償不但具有確實性，而且足以制限其以工業爲基礎的武裝再起。中美兩國對於日本賠償問題的根本方針，雖同以波茨坦宣言爲依據，但兩國應付這問題的重點所在，却未必盡同。美國是側重在削除日本武裝再起的工業根據，並非注重日本對他的損害賠償；美國杜魯門總統的賠償專員鮑萊於在東京即曾聲明過：「我們的目的在使日本非軍事化，並造成民主日本，只要這種佔領的目的能貫澈，即使取不到賠償也不要緊。』這原因，因爲日本所能給與美國的賠償，在美國看來根本無足輕重；這點，鮑萊於一九四五年十二月在洛杉磯曾說：「美國的對日戰費達一千億美金，可是日本能對美賠償的恐怕不到十億美金，　不過是「水桶中的一滴」罷了。」當然美國　堅持着『並非必要之一切物資及工業施設，應予拆除，』作爲賠償，但與其說爲了對美國自己，母寗是注重對遠東各國的損害賠償；鮑萊在洛杉磯發表的談話中，曾說：『日本的工業施設，機械器具等，最近將拆運到中國和菲律賓，因爲日本以外的遠東各國工業的迅速發展，才是使日本不再掀起侵略戰爭的最佳保障。』所以其主要的目的，還是在削除日本侵略工業根據。但是中國，一方面固然重視上面的一點，一方面同樣重視日本對中國自己的損害賠償，因爲中國返需日本賠償機器，在戰災的廢墟中重建並發展工業，所以即使在美國看來是「永桶中的一滴」在中國却是値得珍視的甘露。</p>
<p>不過，無論從削除日本武裝再起的工業基礎說，或從重建並發展自己的工業說，使日本迅速實行賠償，這在有權享受賠償的十一國，在京則上都不會有異議的。但是這事與確定日本應保留的工業備有關，而要確定怎樣程度的工業設備方是日本和平經濟所必需，在和約簽訂以前是不能分曉的。而和約的簽訂，在事前固需要調查和準備，即使在和會召開後，各國的意見也未必能馬上一致，所以不是馬上可以達到的。一方面，遭受戰爭損害的國家正在念切期待着日本的賠償。因此，產生了所謂臨時賠償的計劃，所謂臨時，就是在確定日本應保留的和平工業之前，對於應充作賠償的工業施設作暫時的指定，在指定範圍內，可先行拆運一部份。鮑萊調查團於調查日本殘存工業之後，發表了所謂臨時賠償計劃，遠東委員會根據這計劃，於一九四六年五月成立決議，通知麥克阿瑟，呌他在兵工。造船·航空·工具機械·鋼鐵·軸承·火力發電·硫酸·製鹹·人造石油。人造樹膠·輕金屬等十二門部內，指定充作賠償的工塲，結果被麥帥指定的約爲一千工塲，其機器約爲一千萬噸。四月三日美國訓令麥克阿瑟從速分配的工塲，便是這臨時賠償物資中的一部份。這一部份工塲，約佔麥帥所指定的全額的百分之三十，中國得百分之十五，菲律賓·緬甸與馬來聯邦，荷印各得百分之五。</p>
<p>這次美國的措置，其動機何在，有幾種不同的看法。一種是，因爲鮑萊主張蘇聯自中國東北運去値二十億美元（也有說是僅値九億美元）的工塲設備，應歸入日本全部賠償物資的範圍，不承認是蘇聯的「戰利品」，蘇聯則持相反的主張，因此對於美國自一九四六年八月即提倡的日本賠償會議，始終反對參加，美國此次措置是對蘇聯「攤牌」」。具有反蘇作用；一種是，美國鑑於幾個戰災最重的國家亟待復興，所以先將這部份物資分配；再一種是。美國因爲賠償物資不早日拆去，日本資本家不知道究竟保留的是那些工塲，就不願意積極生產，勢必加重日本目前的經濟國難，所以採取今次的揹置。以中國的立塲說，中國自己是亟待復興，同時也希望日本人民能從資本家的「生產怠業」中掙脫目前經濟的困難，所以對於從速分配日本賠償的這次措置，應當同意的。便使美國的動機是出於第一種，自然不是中國所願意，因爲中國所希望的是國際協調，尤其美蘇的協調，所以中國對於日本賠償問題的態度，也始終主張由遠東委員會的十一國以一致的協議來解決的。但是因爲這次分配的物資是臨時賠償，而且是臨時賠償中的一部份，將來召開對日和會時，日本應保留的工業設備宜如何規定，各國應以怎樣的比例分配，乃至蘇聯運去的東北的工業設備應如何處理，猶有充分檢討的餘裕和解決的機會，所以對於這次的分配，不管美國的動機如何，我們從中國本身，從日本，乃至從波茨坦宣言的旨趣說，都是可以而且應當贊同的。</p>
<p>現在中國將獲得的賠償物資，約達一百三十萬噸，雖然拆廠，包裝，運到日本口岸，都規定由日本政府負責，可是運到中國，重行裝置，這筆費用據行政院賠償委員會佔計，也需法幣八千億元。即使這估計並非失之過低，而且這筆款子可以籌得，同時也不影響赤字財政，但是僅僅靠錢，仍未能解決問題的難點·間題的難點·第一是在船隻，中國現有船隻全部不足三十萬噸，連維持國內的航運還不够，還要担任短時期內運畢這批賠償物資，是不可能的事。這樣，唯有借用美國的船隻，可是據說麥帥過去曾有過不肯派美船代運的表示，所以這事能否做到，未必樂觀。其次，即使運來了，怎樣起卸？有沒有倉庫可堆？再次，拆是別人拆的，裝却要自己來裝，這事是不是毫無問題？即使裝好了，有沒有充分的技術人員可運轉牠？這些問題都不簡單，中國當局如不預爲籌劃，早謀解決，則勝利初期在國內接收敵產時的惡劣塲面，誰也不能保證不致重演。同時鑑於戰敗國的日本，關於道問題早已籌謀有緒，賠償實施法業已制定，運包裝時所需釘子一千二百萬噸，鋼皮六百萬噸等細節都早算定，而中國則未見有何具體的決定，所以不能不令人担憂。</p>
<p>正因爲有這些困難問題，近來國內發生了兩種意見：一種是把中國應得的臨時賠償物資的全部或一部，作價售給日本或其他國家；一種是把物資留在日本，中國獲得主權，而委託日本繼續經營。這兩種都不是好辦法，尤其後者要不得，這事無諭與消滅日本武裝再起的工業基礎，或中國的產業復興，都屬矛盾，並且値茲國際局勢變幻莫測之時，所謂「主權」云去，更是夜長夢多的危險事。日本的保守勢力，對這事是非常歡迎的，二月二十日貴族院議長島銀藏即曾公開在議會中說：『希望聯今國把日本的賠償物資不要拆去，由聯合國組織監督機關，讓日本繼續經營。』這是日本財閥資本家的心跡的暴露，我們無論從中國復興，國際和平，乃至日本大多數人民的利益着想，都不應作這種在日本保守勢力是求之不得的事。其次，把賠償物資出售，美蘇英法等工業先進國不會要這批比較陳舊的機器，菲律賓，緬甸，馬來，荷印等即使需要，但因他們這次自己也獲得分配，同時，與其購買陳舊的，不如向外國購買更新的機器，所以恐怕也不會要。如果售給日本，不但給牠保留了武裝再起的一部份工業基礎，而且違反注重實物賠償的波茨坦宣言主旨，變成了金錢賠償。不過，如果必不得已時，採取這辦法比了僅取得空名的「主權」，還較勝一籌。這原因，一方面因爲波茨坦宣言雖然側重實物賠償，但也沒有明白反對金錢賠償的規定；一方面如果作價川售，可以不受時間及種類的制限，拿來向外國購買較好的機器。日本人曾說：「我們的機器早嫌陳舊，賠償物資被拆運以後，可以向美國購入新的機器。」中國爲什麼不可以這樣做？問題在這樣的變相的金錢賠償，如何纔能保證其有確實性？以及中國是不是決心把這筆賠款用之於復興乃至發展工業，有如日本在甲午戰役取得中國賠款後的利用方法？雖如此，可是畢竟難免影響保持日本和平經濟所需的工業蕊準，所以最合理的辦法，當然還是中國自己運回來，才可以避免上面兩種辦法的一切弊點，時機已迫，且看當局的努力如何。</p>

<h3>文化交流的功用</h3>
<p>— 吳魯芹</p>
<p>聯合國文敎機構的成立，在為未來國際關係的打算上，是一種了不起的，進步的安排，道一進步，一半來自過往的痛苦經騐，一半來自人類的覺悟；在不同的政治思想與觀念所造成的國際現勢下，條約協定等等，僅是對破壞和平的一種束縛，不能認為是對永遠和平的一種保證。束縛的功用是反面的，而且是一時的。這情形正如人與人之間的交，惡經過第三者調停而暫時歇手一樣。歇手的原因可以是碍於調處者的情面；可以是懍然於客觀環境的不利；可以是別的，但這一歇手，甚至於握手言歡，並不能保證日後不為一小小事件，再行翻臉。國際關係亦然，要盼望不再受戰爭的茶毒，我們應在保證和平的正面下點功夫，單是契約上的束縛還不够。半個世紀的病苦經騐，我們不已屢見條約協定可以隨時變成廢紙？</p>
<p>我所說的正面或者積極的方面下一點功夫的意思是什麼呢？在過去我國對國際關係的設計上，太着重防患，而忽略了奠基，更可憐的是在防患的設計上，眼光旣不遠，胸襟又與常狹窄，其結果是防患成為種患，我們能不一承認，强國的政治家早在凡爾賽給第二次世界大戰播了種？去年聯合國文敎機構，集會於巴黎時，有一與會代表曾說，「戰爭導源於人的意念」，我們要想消弭戰爭，首先應着手消弭人類意念上的疙瘩，造成這塊疙瘩的因素，有種族偏見，傳統仇恨，猜忌，誤解等等，目前國際情勢中，那種若隱若現風定同舟又成敵國的跡象，可以說是這許多因素中某一種因素的遺毒未除，和一種因素的擴展，在明日世界重建的神聖工作中，這些病症必須次第消除，是無可置疑的，而常識與往日的經驗又呌我們不能相信，醫治這些病症可靠條約與協定。條約的束縛，縱可見效於一時，實不能期諸永久。這道理很簡單，人與人之間的交誼，要走到道義之交的境地，豈是應酬辭令，酒食徵逐所能為力？宴會席上，酒酣耳熱時之稱兄道弟，祗是點綴熱鬧的塲面，決不能培植眞正的友情，國與國之間的關係之改進，固然不是鷄尾酒會所能奏功，也不是一塲惡戰之後，訂立幾種條約就能見效，此時談天下一家大同世蘇的理想，在空問上我們雖惑感覺到必需，在心理的華備上還嫌不够，因為在這方面的準備工作還差得太遠。</p>
<p>不錯，科學的發達，國與國之間的距離，已到了天涯若比隣的境地，可是距離的縮短，祗增加了一種便利，如果不利用這種更利，在文化交流上用一點心思，則國與國之間的了解與認識，仍然可以是很有限的，仍然可以是很　淺的，人世間的經騐告訴我們，老死不相聞問的隣居，實在很多。縱相過從，亦僅限於喜喪的慶賀與弔唁，應酬而已，離友誼中的最高境地「道義之交」還十分遙遠。國與國之間的關係，又何當不然？目前國際上的紛擾，有一部份應該歸咎於某一種民族的陝隘胸襟，這種狹溢胸襟的擴展，積極的是想把本身的政治意識與生活方式滲入別個民族之同，消極的方面，使引起對不同政治意識與不同生活方式的國家之猜忌，懷疑，與恐懼，文化交流的結果可以逐漸造成彼此間的眞正認識與了解，也就是建立眞正友誼的菸礎。</p>
<p>於此，起了一個問題，即是英國小說家吉卜林所說的「東方是東万，西方是西方。」的偏見。在一般人的認識中，幾乎認為不同民族之間的文化交流與合作是不可能的。我們承認這件工作之不易，並不承認其不可能。有一點必須認淸的，那就是一個民族的文化，有它的特性，各民族之間在文化上有一種通性。文化是一種民族經過多年創造的生活方式之外形。此一民族與彼一民族雖其外表生活，可能差異甚大，區別甚多，但是就其內在的因素，分析起來，我們相信，文化的交流是可能的，而且必有功用的。因為無論此一民族與彼一民族間，信仰如何不同，情調如何不同，語言如何不同，起居飲合如何不同，結果仍缺不了一種共同因素的存在，那就是「人性」。而任何文化都是「人性」的創造。</p>
<p>我們祗認定國與國之間的文化交流是可能的，而且是必有功用的。但是收到這種功用的果實，不是指顧問，一蹴可及的事。它需要時間，需要耐性，更需要胸襟。各民族間必需誠心希望由文化的交流，互謀認識，互求了解，更進而互相影響。國際關係必須在互相認識，互相了解的情况下，才談得到互相敬讓與互相尊重。而不同的政治意識與不同的生活方式，要在互相影響的情況下，才能得到平衡。文化交流的功效，一時也許並不顯而易見，然而人類若能在這方面長久努力下去，它的價値將是不朽的。在實質上講，這種工作是談天下一家大同世界理想的前提。</p>
<h3>未完的作品</h3>
<p>— 蘅薇</p>
<p>李滋諾夫人是我的鋼琴敎師，就我所知，她是帝俄時代的一位郡主。自從列寗舉起革命的義旗，她就開始流浪生涯；足跡遍歷歐洲，最後繞道南洋，跨進我們這古老的國土；為了愛昆明湖的黃昏，於是就決定住下來。</p>
<p>「從前她一定是一位美人」，當我第一次看見她時，就曾這樣想。因為在她這樣年紀，還保持苗條的身材，眞是難能可貴的事。她說一口漂亮的好英語，也決不像別的老太婆，喜歡喋喋不休。從她那幽雅的談吐，雍華的舉止，和微含憂鬰的眸子中，誰都可以發現她已逝的年華該是多麼動人。</p>
<p>她的家就臨近昆明湖，小小的三間精舍，佈置得相當美麗。但最令人注目的，還是壁爐架上掛着的那幅油畫像。晝得是那麼精緻，那麼生動；雖然它只是一幅未完的作品。</p>
<p>那是一個幽美的黃昏，湖面上正泛着落日的金光。當我彈完了最後一個樂章，照例李滋諾夫人，會遞給我一杯咖啡，說：</p>
<p>「孩子，憩一憩龍。眞的，你是有了進步」。</p>
<p>「謝謝你，夫人」。我很滿意我的敎師給我的稱譖，雖然她是常常如此鼓勵我的。我呷一口咖啡後，就又開始注意起那幅油畫來。</p>
<p>「真美」！我說。</p>
<p>「我說這幅盡盡得眞美，夫人。但我有一個疑問」？</p>
<p>「疑問」？</p>
<p>「是的，夫人。你看畫着的這個女孩子，多美，那綠色的禮服，柔和的金髮，和一束黃薔微，倚在她的胸口；一切，一切都顯得那麽調和，那麼美。但是夫人，為什麼這是尙未完成的作品呢？這兒，還有一抹焦痕」？</p>
<p>「是的，孩子。這是尙未完成的作品。但是，它將永遠不能被完成了」。她傷感地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>「夫人，你的意思是說沒有人能把它　完了，是嗎」？</p>
<p>「是的，孩子。畫這畫的人己經離開人世」。</p>
<p>「眞可惜」。</p>
<p>我不覺發出嘆息。但忽然看見李滋諾夫人的眼眸，已充滿淚水。</p>
<p>「夫人，對不起，是我的話，引起你的悲傷嗎？你在流淚」？</p>
<p>「孩子，坐下吧，我要吿訴你這個故事。關於這畫像的一個故事，，願它能帶給你一些啓示」。</p>
<p>她面向着夕腸，在瑩瑩的淚光中，開始敍述那令人哀怨凄絕的一段往事。</p>
<p>那應該追溯到許多年以前，當郡主諾娜在莫斯科的社交塲合中，還佔着一個重要地位的時候。由於她的年輕美貌，和光耀的家世，富有的財產，以及崇高的爵位；她不懂什麽是煩惱，什麼呌憂愁？雖然她被無數的年靑人所追求，可是她却始終是這樣自負地說；</p>
<p>「讓人人都愛我吧，但我決不愛任何人」。</p>
<p>可是居然有一天，她的　傲和矜持受到生平從沒有過的侮辱和輕視。那是當一個冒失的肯年，在她身邊走過，偶然踩了她的拖裙，而若無其事的向她道歉說：「小姐，是我踩了你的裙子？」那麼「對不起」的時候。</p>
<p>於是，諾娜氣得發在了。她是從沒有受過這種輕視的。但，這冒失的年青人，居然並不因她的美責和高貴，而對她有何重視</p>
<p>當諾娜在憤怒和不平中，得知這冒失的靑年名呌彼得布哈斯基，一個脾氣古怪的畫家的時候，她決定去征服這頭強的靑年人</p>
<p>因此一天下午，這有着濃厚羅曼蒂克氣息的嘗試，便開始了。諾娜洗盡臉上的鉛華，換一身學生衣裙；拿著一付書具，去敲這青年畫家的門；之後，她更成了他的學生。</p>
<p>時光在日落出中悄悄地溜走了雖然諾娜每天踏進那扇破舊的門，但每天都把她特有的嬌豔，美麗和神秘的熱，力，帶給那頑強得可笑的先生。於是這年青而頑強的畫家，開始是驚奇接著便是傾倒了。</p>
<p>可是驕倣的諾娜，當她獲得精神上的滿足後，她便忽然記起以往的矜持。於是仿佛一個聲音在對她訴說：</p>
<p>「讓人人都愛我吧，但我決不愛任何人」。</p>
<p>因此，她便毫無留戀和顧忌地，捨棄了彼得布哈斯基。</p>
<p>對於彼得布哈斯　，這自然不啻是一個致命的打擊。他的情感是由諾娜逗發的；但當她瘋狂的愛她的時候，她却又把他拋棄</p>
<p>從此，彼得便用回憶和眼淚，來措索，追尋他往日的快樂和甜密，他用他獨到的奇特的畫筆，在紙上用彩色鈎出諾娜美麗的面影，鈎出他痛苦的回憶，和已逝的欣喜。</p>
<p>最後，書像差不多完成了；只等待着終結的幾筆。可是，神秘幕測的命運之神，却又情情地前來播弄他的遭遇。那是一個嚴寒歲暮的夜晚，當彼得聚精會神地修改他的作品，痛苦咀嚼着他的回憶時，突然他被驚呌和火光從痛苦的回憶中撃醒。他睜眼看時，從窗外門口飄進來的黑烟，幾乎使他窒息。於是他沒有絲毫考慮，本能地抱起那張未完的作品，就向門外衝去。可是剛出門，一段焦樑塌下來，打中他的頭，他就那麼凄慘地，緊抱着他心愛的未完的作品，與世永辭。</p>
<p>李滋諾夫人用動人的詞句，描述完了她的故事後，便低下頭，畫着十字。</p>
<p>於是，屋子裏充溢着窒息似的靜寂。</p>
<p>我望望窗外，夜幕似已朦嚨。於是我向她吿辭，說：</p>
<p>「晚安，夫人。我將永遠記住這動人的故事。謝謝你的敎導和那杯好咖啡。」</p>
<p>「晚安，孩子」。</p>
<p>我臨走沒有再敢回顯那張未完的作品。便倉皇的從李滋諾夫人的悲哀中，逃了出去。</p>
<p>如今十年了，我沒有再見李滋諾夫人。但我却忘不了這動人的故事。十年的歲月雖不長，但　這可哀的故事，和它的女主人翁，又漂流到那裏呢。</p>
<h3>說詩</h3>

<p>詩完全是眞摯的感情充滿了內心，不得不發洩出來的一種東西。所以人詩是情的奔放，是靈的喊叫。唯有詩人才能將眞和美。，一切抒寫出來；亦惟有詩裏才能看到眞，才能看到美。</p>
<h3>約柯伯生百年紀念</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>丹麥大小觀家約柯伯生(J．P．Jacohsen）生歲一八四七年，本於一八八五年。他只活了三十八歲。今年是他的　生百年紀念。我巳譯了詹生（Topsoe　Jensen）的「斯干底那維亞文學」中的一節交給「文潮月刋」，現在再譯馬格紐斯（Magnus）的「歐洲文藝辭典」，聊資點綴。</p>
<p>「約柯伯生(Jons　Peter　Jacobsen，1847-1885）丹麥小說家；以植物學為職業，翻譯達爾文的著作為丹麥文。一八七六年寫「馬麗。格魯浦」（Mistress　Marie　Grubbe）。此書頗不易讀，它却是辛苦作成的。一八五二年他出版「莫干斯及其他短篇小說」（Mogens　and　other　stories）。一八八〇年他出版「尼爾士。林納」（Ｎiels　Lyhne），此書曾被譯成英文，名為「賽倫的聲音」（Siren　Voices），（按　倫見希臘神話與荷馬史詩，她是意大利海岸附近島上三美女神之一，相傳她用她的歌聲　惑經過年航海者，使其滅亡。優力栖　過此，他怕和下的兵士很多被她迷惑的。）聖芝巴理（Saintsbury著名的文學批評史三册的作者）機光輝的丹麥批評家布蘭克斯之後，稱頌約柯伯生的確是前進的；他的私見，認爲作者有屠格湼甫與弗羅貝爾的才能。包以生（Boyesen）在「斯干底那維亞文學」上的意見比絞不大熱情讚美。他覺得約柯伯生</p>
<p>「以研究文飾平庸」，使得讀者「感到同情的渡倦」。」</p>
<p>新近李長之在商務出版到了一本「北區我文學」，關於約柯伯生的一節見面六一至六四。此外可供參考的有：鄭振鐸的「文學大網」卷四面四二七－八，茅盾的「近代文學面面觀」面一六－九，瑪西的「世界文學史話」面六五〇－一，李菊休的「世界文學史網」面二五四，金石聲的「歐洲文學史綱」面二一三。約柯伯生稀少的作品在中國似乎還不會有過譯本。</p>
<h3>雙玉軒詞賸</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>漫道今年花事早，也沒尋春，已恨芳菲少；往事江南愁未了，團團總是人家好。猶是昔時人窈窕，驀地相逢，叵耐驚鴻杳；此去關河羞夢繞，聞來還自傷潦倒。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>又是天涯飄弱絮，草長鶑飛，憶遍江南路；百幅覺箋千萬語，魚沉雁杳知何處。記得花時留小住，不道春來，風月閑庭宇；夜夜斷魂尋舊侶，已知夢裘渾無據。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>昨夜飄風兼急雨，枕畔啼痕，寫盡相思句；樓外天涯閑眷佇，依前瞥見分携處。待得春來春又去，春去春來，一樣無情緒；梁燕雙雙應笑語，華年那便愁如許。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>昨夜星辰夜雨，為了關情，為了深相許，溪水應知離別苦，朝朝却向長亭去。眼底紅稀兼綠聚，已是春歸，猶自歌金縷；雙殷勤　寄語，天涯只合長憐汝。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>簾外小桃開又落，不怨春歸，却憶年時約；應是人間憐索寞，水流花謝非輕薄。枝上未施重錦幕，雨雨風風，光量寗如昨，郎自情稠儂性弱，從敎柳絮同飄泊。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>四壁鳴蛩催暗雨，秋已深深，沒個閑情緒；哀樂都隨流水去，無端還聽歌金縷。記得綠楊城郭住，拾翠尋芳，那識分携苦；應有鈿釵遺舊處，年時總被相思誤。</p>
<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 馬蓋</p>
<p>馬蓋Marquet(1875-）是莫洛的得意門生，現為沙龍基本會員。作風潑刺而洗練，與萬頓更等齊名，活躍於現代巴黎畫壇的中堅作家。此作不大，爲日太原氏購藏。（獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血316</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這時大約正午十二點半左右，烈日當空，異常酷熱。正岩打了電話出來，看見鶴見不在車裏，却在對街那座老匯中大門口遮陽下，舉目向外灘江邊瞧着。正岩急馳過街，告訴鶴見，國際大旅社房間己經定下，恰巧又是915號；朋友也約好了，大約四至五點之間，可以到那裏見面，不見不散。又說他以日本軍部名義，打電話向「工部局」車務處，追問「10915」車照，是什麽人的名義，據車務處所答，却正是日本大使岡本的汽車號碼，然而車身却不是玄色，乃是深藍色，道奇一九三六年出品，八汽缸流綫型橋車。</p>
<p>「你的學問竟長進了，哈……」鶴見笑着。</p>
<p>「是，承隊長誇獎，現在旣不必往國際大旅社去，又是午餐時候，部下想精隊長，黨嘗中國南式御料理……」</p>
<p>「正合我的理想……可是得先就近辦了那件公圍的案子罷，這車夫說，外灘公園就在那邊……車子議牠候在這裏，我們不動聲色過去瞧瞧。我看見你也帶了傢伙，子彈上了膛吧？……」</p>
<p>這外灘公園，不過巴掌大，而又是那們長溜溜沿江一條，那裏能算公園？却因上海這個地方，寸金寸地，在這五六十萬金一畝的中醫中（指十餘年前估價），能够挪出這一塊空地，並且還弄了些音藥亭·金魚池·草地·花圃·之類，要說牠不是公閎，竟有此對不起那們高的地價。</p>
<p>可是白天裏，園中沒有大樹，遇到赤日當空的夏季，除了西餐飯座，和三兩個小茅亭之外，簡直沒有歇凉的地方，所以只能說他是一個夜花園之類的東西。</p>
<p>（這個公園雖小，然在上海，却是人人聞名。最大的講究，還是為這園門外邊，曾經懸過「華人與狗，禁止入內！」的牌吿。這個牌吿，雖說對華人和狗有關，但狗類沒有文字，不懂那一套，却是用的中文和英文兩種文字。英文在上海，是一種通行文字；而且這「華人與狗……幾個字，極其簡單，所以連那各種外國人，類如羅宋·法蘭西·德意志·義·奧·西·葡·等等的起碼人和兒童，都懂得這牌吿上的涵義；最低限度，他們能懂得一華人」與「狗」並列堂　的。</p>
<p>一般有血性的華人，對這含侮性的牌吿，當然憤恨，却因這牌吿後面有畏槍大砲支撑着，所以也不敢公然把牠毀去。却有人問得古怪：「這中國字難道不是中國人繙譯的？難道不是中國人大筆一揮的？難道不是中國人刻製的？他們這些譯的，寫的，刻的人，當日有了洋人的這個命令時，為什發不肯血濺五步，誓死抗爭？那個繙譯官，能够譯出這幾字，那寫的人能　一揮而就，至少也應表示幾分血性哪！」</p>
<p>却另有一部分人是這般解釋的：中央北伐成功之後洋人有些神經過敏，以為中國人已成正果，竟自動把那侮辱華人的牌吿扯去，不僅扯掉牌吿，並且連公園門禁都開放了，任「人」自由出入。他們這一部分人，却親眼看見一些「人」們，拿出「接收」失地的姿態，一擁而入，把花摘了，把樹枝折斷，把金魚撈走；一人佔領一張四五尺長的坐椅，仰天八　陲覺；其餘，則隨地吐痰，隨處尿尿；刮樹皮簽名；「×××到此一遊」山石，板壁，題滿了各式「文藝」作品。這一部分人盡說，「人」們的姿態太勇敢了！所以第二天，那「華人與狗」的牌吿又高懸在公園門口了。）</p>
<p>上面這一段，就發生在這個外攤公園裏。</p>
<h3>金聖歡的天文觀</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>近　「唱經堂才子書彙編」，翻開第一篇，原來就是金聖歎的「講易」。易是很難講的，　時林語堂就因講易講出毛病來，只好匆匆飛返美國去了。金聖歎是淸初的幽默大師，請看看他是怎樣請易的吧：</p>
<p>「南方大火星，獨稱為星者，以此為定盤星故。二十八宿為天文（亦名二十八金），天是正圓底，角次有許多星，亢次有許多星，則角宿亢宿亦正圓，餘準此。東西南北上下為地理，物相雜故曰文，雜而不越故日理。」</p>
<p>天實在太大了，在文人眼裏，也實在難懂得緊：東方甲乙木呀，南方丙丁火呀，胡　一通，自然是可以騙騙鄉下人的；但因此也使人覺得天文地理原來和五行陰陽分不開。利用天文，可以向皇帝撒嬌，討好，利用地理，可以卜葬，發王氣。法術之大確乎太驚人了，但也終於使我們的天文家和方士變成一體。那肉眼裏看出來的「天」，彼此各有不同，金聖歎所說的不過是一例耳。</p>
<p>我想，方士們最初大約是有自知之明的，所行所說也不過是撤說，歛錢，混飯；但後來不知怎的越稅越認眞起來。「仰以觀於大文，文殊也；　俯以察地理，普賢也。天文圓，斷無凡夫因；地理方，已有菩薩因。……」長此下去，他們便逐漸發覺了目己的不凡：以為別人所未見者，唯他才看得到；別人所不解者，唯他以祖傳之　得天票始能解答，本來只消用望遠鏡一探的天，於是被他們越說越神秘，越說越可怕。</p>
<p>以幽默大師的身分來反串正生，絮絮叨叨地談天說地，不肯休止，如果當作對方士們的諷刺着，倒是極有風趣的一件事，可惜不然，大師是扮出了他的道貌岸然的臉孔的·請看他的胡說吧：</p>
<p>「天文只許你觀，觀世音遍觀十方，表裏洞徹，影子不落在同器里邊，然後脫得個幽字。地理只是三變，你只死心塌地。不成前一法，則無因以無後，安知前不是後，後不是前，上下左右亦明，然後證得一明字。」</p>
<p>我不曉得他在說些什麽，只聽得一障嗡嗡的聲音。</p>
<p>從神學到玄學的路是短的，從玄學到科學的路則是漫長的，中國的文人就一直陷落在玄學的陷坑裏不能自拔；王陽明猶然，何况金聖歎乎－因此而覺得他與其來談天文地理，實不如去評註西廂水滸為宜。</p>

<h3>我們的控訴——爲各地被毀報館聲援</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>最近的新聞界可說是面臨多難的季節，不但因物價增高收入微薄，以致本身生存感到嚴重的威脅；也不但因時局艱危，和議不成，着筆措詞，處處感覺頭痛，就是一條短小新聞的刋載，亦往往惹人嫉恨，掀起軒然巨波！這兩月來，成都，漢口，長春，福州，蘇州，鎭江各地的報館，都為了此微小事遭到外界的搗毀。最奇怪的，搗毀的不是地痞流氓，却是屬於知識份子的階層中人！</p>
<p>中國的報業，像老牌的「申報」，雖有七十餘年的歷史，但報業眞正的興盛期，却在於最近的十年間。然而不幸在這十年問，淪陷區的報紙受盡敵偽壓迫，殉難記者達十數人，自由區的報紙，物質上和精神上的困頓，寫出來眞是滿紙辛酸－可是我們沒有怨言，我們體認到一切必須為着支　戰爭的勝利；同時我們也憬憶到戰後新聞界必有一道寬　的前途。戰爭勝利了，一切都失了我們的理想；然而這又有什麽辦法？人必須生活下去，我們的工作也必須繼續下去，儘管新聞事業是如何的艱苦，我們還是職守這崗位上挨善風霜雨雪。落後了的時代鞭着我們要「迎頭趕上」，黑暗的社會迫得我們要主持公道，道種種的客觀環境使每一個有良心的新聞記者都深深地感覺到自己的責任更加重大，於是大家在艱巨的工作上把個人切　的貧困也只有放在腦後了。</p>
<p>為和平民主，為復興中國，這是國人一致的要求。我們表達自己的良心同時也傳播大多數人的呼聲，然而當我們稍稍觸及某　一人或某一團體的病痛時，我們便受到一種不法的「懲罰」（（！）報館可以搗毀，記者可以毆打，沒有聲辯的餘地，沒有評論的控訴，這種不幸的事件眞比我們十年來所受任何的創痛都要悲慘而無可忍受的！</p>
<p>報紙須得天天與讀者見面，誰都不能保證沒有錯誤，但是非公論，自可循之於合理的途徑。受懲處分，只有由政府機關方能執行，如果每人都可挾私恨趁一快，則報紙將永無出版的日子！尤其是身為知識份子中人，平日呼籲民主，領導羣偷，又怎能以暴行對付「民主喉舌」「人民與論」的報紙？</p>
<p>於此，我願與新聞界人十進一言，而我們今日所遭遇的不辛，另一面也就表明了我們的力量。凡是摧毀興論的人，則因為與論的本身已打擊到他們的要害了。我們應該為我們受難而欣慰的</p>
<h3>新聞綱</h3>
<p>— 鐵</p>
<p>房屋租賃條例草案如若經過立法程序，可以打破上海的「金條」堡壘，我們這些無金條無屋住的人，不知將如何致其祝頌之詞。</p>
<p>但其中有幾條，　　法律條文，是無濟於事的。如「餘屋限令出租」「不得收取小費」（即上海人訂下的最惡毒的金條頂費）非由治安當局强制執行，是不能見效的。</p>
<p>生活愈沒有保障，物價却又無底的飛漲；奢侈，豪華，淫糜面的誘惑，使貪汚之風泛濫無止境。</p>
<p>聯合勤務總部經理生產司被服廠裏的舞弊案，不過是千千萬萬舞弊案中的一端而已。</p>
<p>大火案的原因，已由負責當局宣布，大多為火燭不小心，不是烟蒂闖下的大禍，便是其他星星之火，造成了恐怖的火海。疑神疑鬼都大可不必的。上海人自己「火燭小心」，那才是正當阻止火災的辦法</p>
<p>俄羅斯人於耶穌復活節將家家門戶洞開，靑年男子可以任意闖入人家，與女郎接吻。</p>
<p>這便是歐洲與亞州民族性逈然不同之處。</p>
<p>約翰根實會經說過：「亞洲人軟弱而無毅力」。風俗習慣與私生活上，也處處表現着東方人的保守與拘泥。</p>
<p>假如中國女郎有一天有勇氣去迎接男賓們的擁吻，她們的生活態度，應該比現在開朗得多了</p>
<p>據說靑白足球隊特地增加了人馬到上海向東華挑戰，所化的川炎在一千萬以上，結果這塲比賽，却因之流產。我個人以為「東華」是應該出塲應戰，說句俗語「勝敗乃兵家常事」，如若為了互相觀察球藝，即是敗，也是無所謂的，東華何不出戰？</p>
<p>有人說，將來在麥帥訓練之下的日本足球隊，棒球隊，如若來上海挑戰，我們大中華民國的球隊，應戰不慮戰？（這問題，讀者們不妨寫此意見來，者）</p>
<p>擠火車而斃命，無論如何兩路管理局應負完全責任。路局一向對旅客沒想週到，但對於每一班車售出的車票，却漫無限止，對於這個，希鐵路當局予以極大的注意與改進。</p>
<h3>「縣長」</h3>
<p>— 邵甄嗣</p>
<p>九日本報，有這麽一則新聞</p>
<p>做了九年縣長，犯罪八十二案，平均每四十天犯案一件。</p>
<p>結果，判處八個死刑，四個無期徒刑，因為只有一個顧瑩，只能執行一個死刑，剩下的「餘辜」——七個死刑，四個無期徒刑，也只好跟着顧瑩殉葬！</p>
<p>任職九年，不能算短，八十二案，不能算少，事到如今，纔被吿發，這是十足寫出當地紳民的「顢預」。</p>
<p>一個父母官，九年當中，犯罪到八十二案之多，可見這位土皇帝的威風！</p>
<p>假定這顧瑩犯了第一案，即被吿發判刑，那末在這次「騐明正身」的一天，也許就是「期滿　出獄」的一天，這真是應當替顧瑩大呌寃枉的。</p>
<h3>他沒有醉</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>警察：「喂，你認識我是誰嗎？」</p>
<p>醉漢：「我不大認識你，可是你如果把你的門牌號碼吿訴我，我願意送你回家去。」</p>
<p>影譚</p>
<h3>「不了情」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>「不了情」是叙述少女虞家茵興靑年夏宗豫的一段戀愛，夏是有着妻子的，最後家茵為了不願破壞宗豫的家庭而出走了。在他們一人之間，留下了這段不了情。</p>
<p>作者張愛玲將戀愛與家庭這個問題作了戲的主題。可是她無法給你一個健全的答案，她還是以不了了之的結束了這「不了情」。</p>
<p>為什麽會有這樣不了了之的結果，原因是作者缺少了健全的思想與諷識。在這個故事內。處家萬與夏宗豫的戀愛，本身就缺少了健全的基礎，家茵的出走。僅僅是出於自私，她不願意將來別人恨她，她不是為了別人的幸福而犧牲目己的一種覺醒與同情，她是充份的表示了這人物性格上的軟弱與自私；因此她只有逃避。假如宗豫的妻子在醫院裏病死了，宗豫追到了厦門，那末他們一定會結合的，但是將來的家茵又何嘗能與宗豫現在的妻子得到不相同的命運，因為家茵與宗豫的妻子並沒有什麽多大的分別，他們並不是因為共同的思想與事業而結合的。</p>
<p>這個題材是個婦女問題，但作者不從這裏着筆，她不從婦女的職業與生活上去着眼，她把問題轉到了家茵的父親身上，更從這一點强關與扭轉了故事與人物的發展，作者只有令盤陷入失敗的地步。全劇也只能以不了了之的來結束了。</p>
<p>其次是劇本的寫作上，時而喜劇，時而悲劇。極不統一，這就影響了演出的完整。導演桑弧對戲的處理習得出是經過一番努力的，許多小地方都安排得極為聰明妥貼的。可是戲的剪接，却毛病太多了。</p>
<p>陳燕燕的虞家茵，戲演得極自然，缺點是她不能把握幾塲情感激動的主戲，劉瓊只是些　塲戲，談不到好壞。嚴肅的虞父與路珊的姚媽都太誇張了，尤其是前者。張福的夏太太，戲雖少，但演得極　。</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>

<h3>紅佈告</h3>
<p>— 夏天吾</p>
<p>現代化的建築物上，水泥鋼骨的圓旋柱上，貼上了一張紅佈吿，看上去有點礙眼，然而究竟是一張皇皇佈吿，確也够撩眼。</p>
<p>新官上任，照例紅佈吿一張，等因奉此，即日視事。</p>
<p>鼎革以後，遜清滅亡，民國開始，一切更新，那時紅佈吿遍全國，雖然觸目皆是，人民的心裏却都包含着興奮，熟望，至袁賊纂竊，假借名器，紅佈吿所予人民的觀念，究全改變，換興奮為憎厭，變熱望為卑視，紅佈告的生命染上了灰色。</p>
<p>民十五革命光復一階段，是人民心理的新生，事實上，人民好像也呼吸到了一陣新鮮的空氣，那時有一特徵，好像紅佈吿不大看見，新官上任也有，好像誰都不大願意給人駡封建，反革命！</p>
<p>紅佈吿是什麽意義呢？封建的遺留，不容吾認吧？紅是吉利的表徵，紅是喜的表徵，獲得新官，祈求吉利，獲得新官，滿懷心喜，可是在人民道一邊的我們要想，所謂吉利，是讓他吉利的撈換吧？滿懷新喜，那是更不容說得，不僅是新官本人，就連小舅子的娘姨的外婆的外甥恐也沾上一喜呢！</p>
<p>時至今日，紅佈吿在人民心目中的印象如何？觀念如何？恐是一片麻木。我們吃過儲備票四千元一斤的油，今日是吃法幣三千六百元一斤的油，對紅佈吿又有什麽趣味呢？一般稍有一點年紀的人還會有一種儂舊心緒抬頭，退回戀念到民國初元的紅佈告上去。</p>
<p>今日不想求好官，求一不想貼紅佈吿而上任的新官其可得乎？</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「東西收拾好沒有？快走！」機營的祝兆年立刻向蘭這樣催促。</p>
<p>蘭的頭只一點，老祝便飛也似的奔出去，招呼老黃阿李進來，帮着蘭的堂兄搬東西。</p>
<p>這時候，徐胖子臉上已挨了他太太好幾下耳光，上身那件夏威夷衫也揉得不成樣子了；老祝知道自己上去勸解更不成，便向蘭使了一個眼色。</p>
<p>「明表嫂，！明表嫂！」蘭立刻理會了他的意思，忙走過去陪着笑喊：「放了明表弟吧！這件事是祝　　不好，不能怪他！你們再這肅，我臉上也掛不住了！就由我向你陪個禮吧！明表嫂！」</p>
<p>「不關你的事！」但威名素著的徐太太豈是跟人家講理的人。「我只要問他，為什麼不睜開狗眼，交這稱混賬朋友？我要跟他離婚！我要跟他離婚！……」</p>
<p>她在說話的時候，雖然沒有鬆手，可是心神舉竟分散了，徐胖子便凑這個機會，用力一悸，跳出了重園，不顧命的望門外狂奔而出，於是他的尊夫人也就大呌在嚷的窮追下去。</p>
<p>蘭和祝兆年不禁相視苦笑。</p>
<p>這就是火車站哪！</p>
<p>人的視界力所能看到的幾乎全是黑壓壓的一片。那一堆是人，那一堆是行李；　那些人是要上火車去的，那些人是站上的職員，那些人是送行來的，無論誰都不用想分辨出來。而人的動又是那樣的亂，那樣的永無止息，以致使每一個初和這境界接觸的人都會很自然地發生一種錯覺，好像連那些行李也一起在動了！</p>
<p>這還是事站外面馬路上的情形，車站裏面那簡直就是人和行李結成的固體；隊掉長着翅勝從別人的頭頂上飛，吾則你就不用想進去。</p>
<p>老祝帶着蘭和兩個孩子被阻在距離車站四五百碼以外的馬路上，根本就看不到車站裏面的景象，火車是連一些影子也不見。耳朶裏所聽到的全是　雜的人聲，但也不用想聽淸楚一句完整的話語，甚至他們自己要說話也感覺困難。（四三）</p>

Today, he will go to Chung Cheng Park to inspect the 202nd Division of the Youth Army.</p>
<p>At about 6 o'clock, the Chairman and his wife drove to the Bund on Nanjing Road and the Jinling Road area to inspect the city's appearance.</p>
<p>In the evening, they invited Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to dinner at the official residence.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:15 AM, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, went to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road, where they laid flowers and paid their respects at the tombs of Madame Soong and Mr. Endner, and spoke kindly to a group of Boy Scouts who were visiting the cemetery, showing great affection. (Note: The Chairman's instructions on commodity prices can be found on page 4.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Chairman Chiang will inspect the Youth Army at Chung Cheng Park this afternoon. The 202nd Youth Army Division, originally stationed in Suzhou, except for the river and city defense forces remaining in their original defense areas to perform defense duties, all other officers and soldiers arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Chung Cheng Park was closed to the public yesterday, and the Youth Army arranged the inspection ground. At the entrance of Chung Cheng Park, a colorful archway about two zhang high was erected, with the eleven large golden characters "Youth Army 202nd Division Military Parade Ceremony" in the middle on a red background. The national flags of the Kuomintang fluttered in the wind above the archway, which was a magnificent sight. The reviewing stand was built on the northeast corner of the wide square inside the park, facing directly south. The national flag of the Kuomintang and the portrait of the Prime Minister were hung in the center of the stand, with the national anthem, the Prime Minister's will, and the twelve articles of the Youth Code written in regular script below. More than twenty pots of flowers were planted in front of the stand, and the stand was surrounded by blue, white, and red cloth curtains. The top was covered with pine and cypress branches, with the three characters "Reviewing Stand" in the middle, and the national flag of the Kuomintang above. On both sides of the stand, long flag lines of more than twenty zhang were strung with small national flags of the Kuomintang, creating a solemn, neat, beautiful, and dignified atmosphere. Today, Chung Cheng Park will be closed to the public for another day for the Chairman's inspection of the Youth Army. It is reported that Chief of Staff Chen Cheng will also come to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning to participate in the military parade. In addition, the 202nd Division will take special trains back to the Suzhou defense area in batches tonight immediately after the Chairman's inspection today.</p>

<h3>Syngman Rhee Visits the Chairman, Representing the Korean People to Express Gratitude; The Chairman Expresses Great Sympathy for Korean Independence</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Dr. Syngman Rhee, the Korean revolutionary leader, originally went to Nanjing some days ago to await an audience with the Chairman, but because the Chairman came to Shanghai from Hangzhou, he returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, and visited the Chairman at Dongping Road at 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Counselor Stuart, our country's representative to Korea. The conversation lasted for one hour, with Madam Chiang, Mayor Wu, and others present, and Secretary Shen Changhuan acting as interpreter.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Mr. Rhee described to the Chairman the situation regarding the organization of the Korean government and the consultations with the U.S. government authorities in the United States, and expressed on behalf of the Korean people his respect and gratitude to the Chairman for his enthusiasm in assisting the Korean Provisional Government, and especially for the Chairman's full support for Korean independence at the Cairo Conference.</p>
<p>The Chairman immediately expressed his great sympathy for Korea's struggle for independence, and said that China and Korea have always been fraternal countries and should help each other and cooperate. China is determined to make its best efforts to assist Korea in establishing a government, and repeatedly told him, "Please rest assured."</p>
<p>The Chairman also inquired about the recent situation of Kim Gu, and Madam Chiang also said that when Kim Gu was in Chongqing, his friendship with the Chairman and others was extremely close, so she was very concerned. Mr. Rhee thanked them on his behalf, and said that Kim and he were cooperating very closely, and the Korean people hoped that both of them could serve as leaders.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Expresses Support for the Organization of the Korean Government</h3>
<p>Last night, this reporter specially visited Mr. Rhee again at the Cathay Hotel to inquire about his meeting with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>This reporter inquired about the situation in Korea, and he told me the following:</p>
<p>Q: What is MacArthur's opinion on the organization of the government?</p>
<p>A: MacArthur is cooperating with us, and he also hopes that the Korean government will be established as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Q: Are General Hodge's views on the organization of the government consistent with those of MacArthur?</p>
<p>A: General Hodge's views on the organization of the government are now becoming consistent with those of MacArthur. He has also abandoned his previous claim that Communist Party members must participate in the organization of the Korean government, and stated that whether or not the Communist Party wants to participate in the government is up to them.</p>
<h3>It is Claimed That the Soviets Are Conscripting Soldiers in Korea</h3>
<p>Q: General Hodge has announced to the United States that the Soviet Union is conscripting 500,000 young soldiers in northern Korea. Does Dr. Rhee have the same information?</p>
<p>A: What General Hodge said is very accurate and factual. The reports we have received are the same.</p>
<p>Q: What is Dr. Rhee's opinion on MacArthur's suggestion to the Soviet Union in Moscow that the Soviet Union and the United States jointly promote Korean independence and reunification as soon as possible?</p>
<p>A: This is what the United States has always advocated.</p>
<p>Q: According to Dr. Rhee's estimate, when will the organization of the Korean government be completed?</p>
<p>A: I hope it can be completed within three months.</p>
<p>Q: What is the current situation of the Communist Party in Korea?</p>
<p>A: There is almost no so-called Communist Party problem in southern Korea. Most of the Communist Party members come from the north, causing unrest.</p>
<p>Q: What is the economic situation in Korea?</p>
<p>A: It is very difficult. Since Korea was divided into two parts, South Korea has food and other products, but factories, fuel, and electricity are all in the north. The entire economic structure is currently in a state of "paralysis."</p>
<p>Mr. Rhee will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou today for sightseeing and will return to Shanghai around the 16th before returning to his country.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Rhee requested Chairman Chiang to send a plane to send him back to Korea yesterday.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Chairman and his wife hosted a tea party for Syngman Rhee and Li Cheong-cheon, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Liberation Army, Chun, Min Seok-lin, Seo Byeong-ho, Zhang Shou-hyeon, Stuart, and Chen Guolian of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and more than ten other people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at 7:00 PM yesterday and returned to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. Around 9:00 PM, Korean revolutionary leader Syngman Rhee visited him and expressed his deep gratitude to President Sun for his sympathy for the Korean independence movement. The two also exchanged views on the issue of enhancing Sino-Korean relations, talking for about half an hour before Mr. Rhee departed.</p>
<h3>Part of the National Army Airlifted for Reinforcement; Tranquility in Shijiazhuang City; The Garrison at Jingxing Spares No Effort to Ensure the Mining Area</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Official sources say: The situation in Shijiazhuang has eased slightly. It is reported that another part of the reinforcements and weapons have been airlifted to Shijiazhuang, which will help stabilize the morale of the city's people. At night, the Communist army's attack is still urgent. Last night, they launched several fierce attacks from the southeast, attempting to break into the city's ring railway, but were eventually repelled and shelled the urban area. Except for the Jingxing mining area, the National Army has withdrawn all outposts around Shijiazhuang to the edge of the urban area in order to defend firmly. In order to ensure the mining area, the garrison and county government in Jingxing city automatically withdrew to the mining area more than ten li outside the city last night.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 13th] The battle of Shijiazhuang is expanding fiercely. The National Army has airlifted troops to reinforce on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] At 4:00 PM on the 13th, relevant parties contacted Shijiazhuang and learned that Shijiazhuang city was quite tranquil and that the loss of Jingxing was also unconfirmed. It is also learned that fierce battles are taking place on the outskirts, with a fierce struggle for Daguo Village. At the moment, the Shijiazhuang airfield is still usable and is home to bombers to protect Shijiazhuang.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] Sun Lianzhong convened senior personnel from the Baosui Headquarters and local military leaders on 12.13 to issue instructions. Communication between Baoding and Shijiazhuang is constant day and night. It is reported that a strong National Army is awaiting an opportunity to go south along the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section to assist. Another message: The military has confirmed that Luancheng fell on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] It is reported that after the transportation on the north, south, and west sides of Shijiazhuang was cut off, the National Army contracted its forces to defend Shijiazhuang city. The war is spreading along the Zhengtai Railway Line, and railway personnel have been evacuated in advance. Jingxing and Weishui may have fallen yesterday. Huolu Lian telegraphed in urgency, and the situation in Yuanshi remains unclear to this day. In addition, the destruction of transportation on each line is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] The situation in Shijiazhuang is extremely tight. The Communist army pressed the suburbs of the city on the third day and yesterday, and the artillery battle between the two armies was fierce. Shijiazhuang is heavily besieged on all sides, and prices in the city are soaring. Commander Luo Lirong has issued a special strict order and implemented a general mobilization of the city's pacification work, cooperating to strengthen defense works. It is said that Shijiazhuang has abundant materials and sufficient grain for half a year. Luo said: The city defense is absolutely safe, and I hope the people will live in peace.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] The news that the Communist army invaded Zhengding city on the night of the 11th was confirmed by the military on the 13th. After the Communist army entered the city, the street fighting was fierce, and fires broke out everywhere. More than 70,000 military officers and civilians within forty li of the city walls fought fiercely for five days and nights and bravely broke through on the morning of the 12th. The Communist army suffered extremely heavy casualties, making it one of the most tragic county city defense battles in Hebei Province.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Talks About the Battle Situation; The Beiping-Tianjin Line Has Resumed Traffic Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 13th] Sun Lianzhong told this reporter at 10:00 AM on the 13th: (1) The battle of Shijiazhuang is still proceeding fiercely. On the 11th, there was still telegraphic communication with Leicheng, Huolu, Yuanshi, Weishui, Jingxing, and the mining area. Subsequently, the situation was only reported on the 13th. (2) The main force of the Communist Army's Second Column has been fiercely attacking the northwest suburbs of Shijiazhuang and Daguo Village airfield for several days. So far, the defending troops have been bravely fighting back. The Communist army has continued to increase reinforcements and pressed close to the first-line outer defensive trenches of Shijiazhuang yesterday, and the battle was extremely fierce, but the Communist army was repelled by the National Army. The National Army at the airfield also used dense artillery fire to bombard the bridge east of the city, and the Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. (3) Cangxian was previously besieged by the Communist army. After I went to Tianjin on the 4th to direct the repulsion, I transferred to Tangshan to inspect the pacification work in eastern Hebei. At the moment, there are still Communist troops fleeing in the north of the eastern Hebei Railway, and the security of the entire area is gradually stabilizing. (4) The troops of the Communist army attacking Shijiazhuang are mostly the remnants of the western Hebei campaign, and their combat power is quite low. The defensive works of Shijiazhuang are strong, and there is no need to worry about the city's defense. (5) The National Army in Zhengding transferred its battlefield to the vicinity of Shijiazhuang on the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The Beiping-Tianjin line resumed traffic on the 13th, and the National Army is continuing to mop up the Communist army harassing this section of the road on the north bank of the Yongding River. The statement that Shengmang Town in southern Tianjin has been recovered is untrue. The National Army is besieging it and will be able to capture it soon. The local Communist Party has renamed itself the City Communist Army, with about three regiments, which often harass the suburbs of Tianjin. In addition, a section of the Pinggu Line between Huailai and Miyun was destroyed last night.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo Returns to Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo returned to Shenyang from Panshi last night. The Jilin Line is temporarily calm.</p>
<h3>An Armored Vehicle Patrolling the Road Between Qingxian and Machang Hits a Mine</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] On the evening of the 12th, an armored train patrolling the road on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway hit a mine between Qingxian and Machang. Two sections of the road vehicle were blown off the rails, and all trains were blocked.</p>
<h3>Receiving Personnel Are Stranded in Shenyang; Factories in Dalian Are Shut Down</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] According to well-informed sources, there are many complications regarding the takeover of Dalian, and more than a thousand factories in Dalian have been shut down.

<h3>Communist Officers and Soldiers Released from Zhengzhou Are Determined to Be Given Travel Expenses and Sent Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th] More than 3,000 officers and soldiers of the Communist army under Liu Bocheng who were captured in the northern Henan campaign have been released from Zhengzhou. The military authorities here have decided to give them travel expenses and send them back to their hometowns, while guiding them on the path to education and employment.</p>
<h3>The Lu Area Relief Account Shows That the Funds Are Distributed to Each Area in a Unified Manner</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] Gu Zhenggang, the chief of the Executive Yuan's Pacification Area Refugee Relief Corps, telegraphed on the 9th to 18 counties in Shandong Province, including Changle, Changqing, Tai'an, Dong'a, and Linyi, allocating 900 million yuan in emergency relief funds. A reserve of 300 million yuan was remitted to the emergency relief teams in each area on the 20th of last month to distribute the funds in a unified manner to relieve refugees.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Establish Two Committees to Guide Election Matters; The Legislative Yuan Will Review the Main Bills Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] After the promulgation of various election laws for the implementation of constitutional government, all sectors are now actively preparing for the elections. The authorities are cautiously preparing the matters. In addition to setting up an Election Supervision Committee to preside over the matter, they will also set up a Guidance Committee to be responsible for guiding various election matters before the election, so that those elected are mostly virtuous and capable. This institution may be attached to the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association, or it may be established separately, and branches will be set up in each province. The first step of the committee's work is to conduct a general survey of the virtuous and capable people in various places.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The 321st regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 15th. The main bills include the draft organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission, the draft emergency economic measures plan, the handling methods for the official shares of the Small Four Banks, and the draft legislative principles of the Provincial Bank Law. The draft Bank Law has been reviewed and is expected to be submitted at the 322nd regular meeting. In addition, Legislative Yuan members Jian Shi and others previously suggested that the Executive Yuan explain the use of the 500 million US dollar loan, and the reply has now been delivered.</p>

<h3>The National Army in Northern Shaanxi Enters Jingbian; At the Same Time, Preparations Are Stepped Up at the Yellow River Ferry; Communist Army Activities Are Discovered on the Border of Rehe and Chahar</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] Jingbian, Shaanxi, was suddenly attacked by the National Army on the morning of the 12th and entered the city at 9:00 AM. After half an hour of street fighting, the city was completely occupied, and the remaining Communists retreated towards Suide. The Communist army in the Suide and Mizhi areas launched a fierce counterattack, and as many as six brigades of the Communist army sneaked into the Panlong and Yongping areas. They once counterattacked Qingjian and Yanchuan, disturbing the rear and periphery of the National Army. The National Army is counter-encircling them, and the two armies are engaged in a decisive battle here.</p>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Ningxia, 13th] According to a telephone call from Dingbian, the National Army recaptured Jingbian County on the afternoon of the 13th, and more than 300 remnants of the Communist army fled to Nanshan. Ma Hongda arrived in Dingbian from Yanchi at 9:00 AM on the 13th for inspection.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 13th] The National Army marched towards southern Shanxi in two routes. It is reported that one route has already crossed Fenglingdu and arrived near Yuncheng, and the other route is passing through Yumen Pass and heading straight for Hejin and Jishan. The battle situation in southern Shanxi is about to change.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 13th] The situation in Shanxi is cloudy, and fierce battles are raging in southern Fen and western Shanxi. The situation in northern and central Shanxi is also not optimistic. More than 30,000 Communist troops who crossed the Yellow River from eastern Shaanxi through Hequ, Baode, and Lishi are moving towards Fenyang and the western border of Xiaoyi, stirring up trouble.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The Communist army under Chen Geng has reached the east bank of the Yellow River. At the moment, Communist troops have been discovered everywhere from Jixian Xiaochuanwo in the north to Ronghe Miaoqian Ferry in the south, eager to cross the Yellow River. The National Army on the opposite bank is also prepared. At the Yumen Ferry south of Hejin, the two armies have already engaged in an artillery battle across the river on the 11th, and there are reports that the National Army has recovered Dongyumen with the cooperation of land and air forces. Chen Geng's move is obviously intended to cross the river to the west and enter Shaanxi, threatening the rear of the National Army. If he fails, occupying the east bank of the Yellow River can also increase the burden on the National Army along the river in Shaanxi, and prevent the National Army from entering Shanxi from Shaanxi. In addition to attacking along the river, Chen's troops have also left a part of the Communist army to devote themselves to the expansion of the eastern and western corridors of Shanxi. At the moment, the situation in Wanquan, located at the elbow of this Communist corridor, is unclear. Quwo Siguan has been lost. It is reported that a part of the Communist army has infiltrated the city, and the situation in Xiangning and Fencheng is also very critical. Jixian, Wenxi, Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng are also under siege by the Communist army. Hu Zongnan's troops are crossing the river from Tongguan to provide assistance. In central Shanxi, the Communist army is harassing Wenshui, Jiaocheng, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Pingyao, and Qixian, forming a semi-encirclement of Taiyuan, seemingly attempting to isolate Taiyuan, and attempting to prevent the Taiyuan National Army from developing to the southwest and cut off its corridor between northwestern and southeastern Shanxi. The attacks on Shijiazhuang in the east, the Zhengtai Line, Zuoyun in the north, and Youyu and Huairen in the right are all launched to isolate Taiyuan. Although the situation in Shanxi is becoming increasingly serious, there is no need to worry about Taiyuan. Relevant parties said: The four group armies under Yan Xishan are all concentrated in the border to defend Taiyuan, so there should be no problem.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 13th] Military sources: More than 6,000 Communist troops under Nie Rongzhen, with heavy weapons, attacked Pingdingpu in Guyuan on the 10th and engaged in a fierce battle with the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The 37th and 39th regiments of the Communist Army's 13th Brigade sneaked into the border of Rehe from Baimaguan. On the 11th, they moved along the Heihe River towards the border of Rehe and Chahar, and a part of them have reached Datan, seemingly attempting to join forces with the Communist army in Guyuan.</p>
<h3>Shandong-Jiangsu Border Steps Up the Elimination of the Yi Meng Mountains Encirclement Area Shrinks</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] The National Army on the Shandong-Jiangsu border has stepped up its elimination work in recent days. At 10:00 AM on the 12th, the National Army recovered the large and small Liangbi between Tancheng and Pi County, and at 5:00 PM recovered the outposts of Sihuzhen, Lufang, and North and South Qiao. Another mobile unit of the National Army recovered Hongshanzhen at 2:00 PM on the 12th, and the remaining Communist troops fled towards Weizhuang in the northeast of Yi County.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 13th] The National Army in central Shandong continued to tighten the encirclement of the Yi Meng Mountain area. The National Army, which searched and advanced on both sides of the northeast from Bianqiao at 12:00 PM, successfully recovered Fuma Well, Huiquan, and South Longtai, and captured many.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jinan, 12th] Commander Wang Yaowu said: After the National Army controls Dalian, it can cut off the main northern supply route of the Communist army in the Shandong area, and the civil war in this area can be shortened by six months. Therefore, the resolution of the Dalian issue is of great importance to the smooth progress of the war. We have received confidential reports proving that most of the Communist army's food, military supplies, and ammunition are shipped south from Dalian, passing through the strait to Yantai and various ports in northern Shandong. Although the government army's strength and equipment are superior to those of the Communist army, it is not easy to drive out the Communist army and restore transportation along the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways.</p>
<p>Han Biyao in Yantai and the Communist Army in Zichuan and Other Places Massively Produce Ammunition</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 12th] The focus of the war in Shandong Province has always been in southern and central Shandong in the past week. In order to realize its dream of besieging Linyi again and disturbing northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is concentrating its main force on the outskirts of Linyi, with an estimated 150,000 people from five columns, including the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, gathered in the Yishui and Ju County areas. An estimated 70,000 people from the 1st, 2nd, and part of the 3rd columns are gathered between Xintai and Mengyin. The main force of the 3rd column, with more than 20,000 people, is still fleeing in the mountainous area around Liangqiu, east of Linyi and south of Fei County. After being besieged by the National Army for days, it has become exhausted, and its attempt to attack Linyi by dividing and combining, and to disturb northern Jiangsu again, will not be difficult to completely crush. In order to prevent the National Army from landing on the coast, the Shandong Communists have recently established a Coastal Defense Command. Heavy troops are stationed at various key ports from Jiaozhou Bay in the north, through Lingshan, Weishi, Jiushuo, Antongwei, and Linhongkou. In order to make the Yi Meng Mountain area its most powerful base in eastern China, the Shandong Communists have been transporting ammunition and grain south from Huimin, the seat of the Shandong Binhai Military Region, day and night, without interruption. In each transport team, all the large vehicles are often more than a thousand. Even so, the Shandong Communists are still insufficient and have gone on to convert all iron factories in Yantai, Boshan, Zichuan and other places into munitions factories to massively produce ammunition. As for the outskirts of Jinan and the Changwei area, because only the 10th Column (ie, the 7th and 11th Divisions) and the 6th Security Brigade are left, their strength has been sharply reduced. In the past week, there has been no major war except for small contacts. However, in order to avoid a coordinated supporting strike on Jinan by the 1st and 2nd Security Brigades of Fan Jiazhen in Taian Dong, Jinan's curfew time has been shortened, from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, but the Jinan National Army is still on high alert, preparing for the arrival of the Communist army, and is ready to encircle and annihilate the 300,000 Communist troops in the south of the Jiaoji Road, west of the Jinpu Road, and north of Linyi with a well-prepared posture along with the advancing corps to the north.</p>
<p>The Ji-Xu Highway Will Open to Traffic the Day After Tomorrow; the Middle Section of the Jinpu Railway Is Being Actively Repaired</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 13th] The Jinan-Xuzhou highway is scheduled to officially open to traffic on the 16th. Since the National Army recovered various counties in western Shandong, the Provincial Highway Bureau has instructed workers to rush to repair the highway from Jinan through Changqing, Dong'a, and Wenshang to Jining in order to facilitate travel. After trial runs, it has been successfully completed. The bureau has now scheduled to officially sell tickets on the 16th. The passenger ticket price is 150 yuan per kilometer, and the freight ticket price is 2,000 yuan per ton per kilometer. From Jinan to Jining, a distance of 180 kilometers, the journey is tentatively set at two days. The first day is to Dong'a, and the second day is to Jining. From Jining to Xuzhou, there is an early connecting bus. From now on, in addition to air transport, Jinan has gained a land transportation corridor to the outside world. In addition, the Jinan to Luokou highway along the Yellow River in Licheng is also scheduled to officially open to traffic on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] After the middle section of the Jinpu Railway was opened, the Railway Bureau actively rushed to repair the Jinan-Xuzhou section. More than 40 personnel from the Jiaoji Railway's car and station affairs department are scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 14th to transfer to Mankou to participate in the repair and opening of the middle section of the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<h3>Northeast Thaw and Spring Warmth Lead to Dangerous Conditions on the Shenyang-Anshan Railway; Communist Activities in Changchun's Western Mountainous Region</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] As the Songhua River thaws, the Communist forces have shifted their activities to the western mountainous region of Changchun. Recently, they have moved south from areas around Fulongquan and Changling, attempting to infiltrate Huaide and Siping to cut off the China Changchun Railway. However, the National Army is on high alert.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The Pan-An Railway officially opened to traffic on February 17th. Among its 287 bridges, most are constructed with wooden sleepers. Now, with the spring thaw, snow in the mountains is melting, and ice floes are flowing downstream, creating a risk of collapse and erosion of roadbeds and bridge piers at any time. According to Wang Fengrui, Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, due to budget constraints for reconstruction, immediate action is not possible. The railway administration has dispatched emergency response teams stationed at various bridges, using explosives day and night to break up ice floes and provide manual bridge protection. However, there is a constant possibility of disruptions and dangers.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] It is reported that Yun Ze, a member of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman of the Puppet Inner Mongolia, is currently in Harbin for important consultations with key leaders of the Northeast Communist Army. (1) Yan Baohang has been very active since arriving in the Northeast and is now the Chairman of the Puppet Liaobei, residing in Baichengzi, northwest of Changchun.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiazhen's Leg Injury Healed in Harbin</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 13th] According to sources from Songbei, Chen Jiazhen, the Changchun Garrison Commander captured by the Communist forces during the "April 14th" incident last year, is currently residing in Harbin. His leg injury has healed, and he can walk without a cane. Also in Harbin is Li Zhengyi, the commander of the 25th Division, who was captured by the Communist forces on the Tonghua front.</p>

<h3>Domestic Assets for Japanese Reparations Valued at US$130 Billion; Total Demands from Various Countries Several Times Higher than Highest Estimates; US Seeks Priority for Liquid Assets</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] It is reported that the United States' proposal for Japan to provide domestic assets for reparations to various countries is valued at approximately US$130 billion to US$150 billion. China's demands are similar to or higher than those of the United States. In addition, Britain, the Soviet Union, the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, India, Canada, the Netherlands, and France are expected to submit their claims in the near future. Officials here point out that the total amount demanded by various countries, when calculated in currency value, will exceed the highest estimated value of Japanese assets by several times. The amounts demanded by various countries can only serve as a basis for calculating the percentage of reparations each country should receive. Officials state that there are two truly important factors: (1) the level of industrial capacity Japan will be allowed to retain; (2) the actual distribution of all Japanese industrial assets exceeding this retained level by the eleven member nations of the Far Eastern Commission. As for Japan's overseas properties, they are not included in the distribution, as each victor only needs to consider the Japanese assets within its territory as already obtained.</p>
<p>A significant amount of Japan's domestic liquid assets, such as gold bullion and other similar items, can certainly be confiscated by the Allied nations. However, the United States has declared that it is considering its priority claim to these assets to offset the costs of the American occupation, the costs of providing food to Japan, and the costs of lending raw materials such as cotton to Japan to restore its industrial production (these costs are expected to be repaid by Japanese exports and manufactured goods). Thus, the two can be offset as reparations, as the cost of occupation and food is expected to equal or exceed the total amount of liquid assets Japan can repay to the United States.</p>
<p>According to US officials, Japan is considering the following scope of reparations: (1) Japan is willing to relinquish all its foreign properties; (2) Japan is willing to relinquish all its domestic liquid assets to pay for the cost of occupation and food; (3) Japan is willing to cede all industrial assets above the level determined by the Far Eastern Commission to the eleven member nations of the Far Eastern Commission. If the Far Eastern Commission adopts the United States' proposal in its meeting, the level of Japanese reparations should be 10% less than the amount proposed in the Pauley Report of early 1946, but 15% more than the amount in the final report Pauley presented in mid-1946. As for the total amount of Japanese assets available for reparations, no clear agreement has been reached to date. Officials here believe that the most reliable estimate can only be obtained after officials from the State Department and the War Department in Washington, D.C., jointly consult with officials from the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan who have come here to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Rapid Expansion of Japanese Textile Industry; China Will Be Severely Affected; Huang Yuanbin Suggests Limiting the Number of Japanese Spindles</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Economic circles here are quite concerned about the rapid expansion of the Japanese textile industry after the war (this industry is one of the light industries that the Allied Headquarters has already decided Japan should retain). Due to the heavy losses suffered by Chinese textile factories during the war and their continued backwardness, there is a deep fear that Japanese textiles may re-enter the Far Eastern market, including China, and be manipulated by them, as was the case before the war. Huang Yuanbin, an important figure in the Economic Policy Committee who drafted the emergency economic measures in mid-February, warned of the danger of Japan resuming high-pressure competition, stating that this would severely hit China's war-torn and yet-to-recover textile industry. He pointed out that Japanese spinning mills currently have 3 million spindles back in operation, with another 3 million spindles ready to be put into use, while China currently has a total of only 1.4 million spindles. He expressed dissatisfaction with MacArthur's suggestion not to include Japanese textile machinery in the reparations dismantling projects, accusing Japan of retaining this textile industry as proof that it still harbors ambitions for renewed aggression against China, at least in the economic sphere. He revealed that the Economic Policy Committee is paying close attention to this situation and has therefore designated him as the person responsible for studying countermeasures. He suggested that China should promptly send representatives to Japan to discuss with the Allied Headquarters to limit the number of spindles Japan retains to the bare minimum. In order to prevent possible Japanese competition, China should raise tariffs and reform the currency system to establish reasonable tax rates. He also suggested that China's cotton production should be increased.</p>
<h3>Investigation into Diplomatic Representatives of the Japanese Puppet Government; Their Current Situation is Vastly Different from the Past; Engaging in Farming and Commerce, Among Other Pursuits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The diplomatic representatives of the Japanese puppet Nanjing government, who were dissolute and uninhibited during the war, are now in a situation that is vastly different from the past. However, the circumstances of most of them are still not bad. A certain magazine recently conducted an investigation into this group of diplomatic personnel (approximately 30 people), stating that some of them have been judged as suspected war criminals, many have entered the business world, some are still serving in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two have switched to agriculture, and some are unemployed and awaiting repatriation. Gu Zhengzhi, the "ambassador," is currently a suspected war criminal detained in Sugamo Prison awaiting trial. Yamada Otozo, the commander of the Kwantung Army and ambassador to "Manchukuo," is currently a prisoner of war held by the Soviet Union in Khabarovsk. Horiuchi, the "minister to Shanghai," is still in China, and it is believed that he has a good relationship with some government leaders (if diplomatic relations between China and Japan are restored, he is highly likely to become the first Japanese ambassador to China after the war). Kusunoki, the "minister to Beiping," has been unemployed due to his close ties with the military. Kato, the "consul-general in Xuzhou," has returned to his fields in northern Kyushu. Another consular official, Mochizuki, has also returned to his hometown to farm. Tanaka, the "consul-general in Nanjing," is currently working at the Far East Military Tribunal.</p>
<h3>Philippine Newspaper Improves Attitude and Praises Sino-Philippine Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] The Manila Post, which has been considered to have anti-Chinese tendencies, has now changed its attitude. An editorial in today's newspaper stated that the most encouraging news this week is the progress of the Sino-Philippine treaty. Both China and the Philippines believe that it is unwise to insist on their own views and be unwilling to coordinate with each other. If China and the Philippines maintain friendly relations, both will undoubtedly benefit. The Manila Chronicle, which first slandered Minister Chen Zhiping in mid-February, today praised Minister Chen and Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino, saying that their efforts led to a satisfactory result in the talks, and that China and the Philippines will maintain friendly relations forever.</p>

<h3>New Construction Plan for the Capital; City Divided into Four Districts, Emphasizing Road Repair and Public Utilities; To Be Implemented After Next Month; Executive Yuan Has Allocated 20 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi often tells reporters: "I am an engineer through and through. I only have the ideals of an engineer. I hope these ideals are practical, but not grandiose." Mayor Shen previously presented a five-year construction plan for the capital to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. With confidence, Chairman Chiang reduced the five years to three years and ordered Mayor Shen to proceed with the plan. According to city government officials, this plan will begin to be implemented after May of this year. Mayor Shen may be envisioning a new Nanjing, with the splendor of a truly modern city. Mayor Shen said: "The new plan is a synthesis of all previous plans. The plan divides Nanjing into four districts: the political district, the residential district, the educational district, and the commercial district." The City Council has proposed adding an industrial district, which, if adopted, will make it five districts. The plan emphasizes the construction of roads and the reform of public utilities. The Executive Yuan, on the order of Chairman Chiang, has allocated 20 billion yuan as capital construction funds, distributed as follows: (1) 14 billion yuan for improving urban transportation; (2) 3.5 billion yuan for improving educational facilities; (3) 1.5 billion yuan for building public housing; (4) 1 billion yuan for improving sanitation management.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Causes Trouble in Downtown Capital; Mr. Zhang Refuses to Buy Ticket on Public Bus; Leads to Major Conflict, Opening Fire and Arresting People</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] At around 9 AM this morning, a certain officer Zhang from the Traffic Police Headquarters refused to buy a ticket when riding a bus of the Jiangnan Public Bus Company. When the ticket inspector of the company's bus number 22 came to check, Zhang still ignored him and said that he never bought tickets, which caused a dispute. After getting off the bus, Zhang, together with more than ten traffic police officers from the headquarters, carrying two Mauser pistols, waited near the Jiuguo Daily on Taiping Road in the downtown area one hour later. When they saw a Jiangnan bus passing by, they ordered it to stop without asking any questions and took the ticket seller and the driver down to beat them. After that, every Jiangnan bus that passed by was abused. This aroused public outrage and led to a fight. At this time, the police officers fired more than ten shots and arrested the ticket seller and several passengers. At the same time, ticket seller Qian Xiaobo, female passenger Zhang Xiao, and Zhu Yonglin, the person in charge of store number 430 on Taiping Road, were all seriously injured. At this time, the order in the nearby area was chaotic, as if facing a major enemy. All Jiangnan buses immediately went on strike. Later, the military police heard the news and went to persuade them, arresting Mr. Zhang on the spot, and at the same time persuaded the drivers and ticket sellers of the Jiangnan Bus Company to resume work and restore traffic. The incident finally came to an end at 11:30 AM.</p>

<p>Wujin Xie Bi, the magistrate of Lishui County, recently went to the province to present the extremely difficult financial situation of the county to Chairman Wang and ask for instructions. On his way back to his post, near the No. 5 bridge about eight li from Jintan, the car overturned into the river. Magistrate Xie was immediately trapped under the car in the water. Fortunately, he was familiar with swimming and struggled out of the water, avoiding drowning. He was seriously injured and came to Wujin Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Lanxi The construction of the Jinlan branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was once suspended. The Railway Bureau, in view of the actual needs, has now resumed construction and is actively proceeding. The track laying is scheduled to begin on the 20th of this month, and the official opening to traffic is scheduled for May 1st.</p>
<p>Hefei Chaohu Lake, the core of the four counties of Hewu, Chao, and Ying, with a surrounding area of 420 li, has become a den of bandits in recent years and a corridor for Communist forces to communicate. In order to maintain water security, the Provincial Government has decided to add a Chaohu Police Corps on the lake to suppress them. The organization has already begun and will soon go to Laoshan on Chaohu Lake to carry out patrols.</p>
<p>Jinshan The 35th-year farm levy of the Yuanpu Pasture Field was clearly exempted by the Ministry of Finance last year. However, in February of this year, the Jinshan County Government suddenly issued a notice to change the collection to land tax. People from the three counties of Songjiang, Fengxian, and Jinshan jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, which recently issued a reply with the serial number Yan Jing Zi 8728, which stated: "The telegram and attachments have been fully received and have been forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Jinshan County Government to stop changing the collection to the 35th-year land tax. Let it be known, this approval," etc. This shows that the Ministry of Finance maintains the original plan and is determined not to change it.</p>
<h3>China and Egypt in Negotiations; Egyptian Cotton Shipped to China in Exchange for Goods</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 12th] According to the Egyptian Ministry of Finance's Cotton Department, Egypt currently has no intention of selling cotton to China through credit loans, but the Chinese and Egyptian governments are negotiating for Egypt to ship cotton to China in exchange for other goods. It is reported that Captain Harkin, a representative of the Allied Headquarters, is also discussing with the Egyptian authorities the shipment of Egyptian cotton and cotton cloth to Japan in exchange for Japanese phosphate compounds and salt.</p>
<h3>An Impressionistic Record of Northern Jiangsu (II): The People Need All-Around Stability</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter, Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>"We need to ensure security and seek livelihoods in stability." This is the urgent plea of every resident who remains in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Under the Communist Party's terrifying policies of arson and murder, the broad masses of the people have been forced into family ruin and displacement. Social order has been utterly destroyed, leading to the widespread tragedy now seen across Northern Jiangsu. As we travel across this fertile land, it is infuriating to see the magnificent landscape stained with blood everywhere.</p>
<p>The people say repeatedly, "It is not enough for us to maintain stability in just a few spots, because the stability of Northern Jiangsu depends on the vast expanse of rural areas." However, let us also hear the opinions of the military authorities: "They believe that for Northern Jiangsu to truly ensure security, the people of Northern Jiangsu must rouse themselves; that is, they must achieve the militarization of Northern Jiangsu, so that everyone has a gun, and everyone rises up to defend their hometown."</p>
<p>However, talking is easy, but doing is another matter, and political work comes into play. Commander Li once said in a public gathering, "The Communist Party's only success in Northern Jiangsu is that they do good political work. They have organization, training, and unified action. From this, we can understand the reason why the Communist Party can still exist today; the main condition lies in this."</p>
<p>As for strengthening the ranks of cadres, this work has not been absent in Northern Jiangsu, but it has not been done well. As a result, the outcome is worse than if it had not been done at all. The word "malpractice" has harmed the entire plan; good people do not want to be district or township heads, while bad people fear they will not get the position. As a result, the people are caught in the middle, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and unable to live or die. On the one hand, they are terrified of the Communist Party's arson and murder; on the other hand, they are afraid of the "bad ruffians" abusing their power, extorting and blackmailing.</p>
<p>Therefore, a subtle effect, which is also an extremely serious problem, has arisen as a consequence. Under the instinct for survival, who is not afraid of arson and murder? Thus, the Communist Party has seized upon the general weakness of people's desire to live and fear of death, and through coercion and temptation, has achieved its conspiracy. Because the people want to avoid suffering immediate losses, many people, under this contradictory psychology, are forced to join the Communist army. Therefore, the main reason why the war in Northern Jiangsu can continue to erupt is due to this never-ending stream of "militia members." The real Communist soldiers are merely standing behind the scenes, pulling the strings!</p>
<p>In the method of winning over the masses, it is clear that it has been quite unsuccessful in the recovered areas. The village self-defense forces we see, with a dozen or twenty guns, are all bought at a considerable cost, and not every gun is guaranteed to fire properly. Moreover, the training period is insufficient, and once something happens, it is not easy to take effect. But the Communist army, on the contrary, possesses a considerable number of exploited militia, many of whom are natives of Northern Jiangsu, familiar with the situation and the geography. During the day, they mingle with the people, gathering information; at night, they pick up their guns and become representatives of arson and murder. Even if the National Army has sophisticated weapons and fierce firepower, what use is it against these vagrants and bandits scattered over a vast area?</p>
<p>Let us also look at the current military force used by the Communist Party in Northern Jiangsu. Take the recent Battle of Libao as an example; the Communist army mobilized the nominal strength of eleven independent regiments. In reality, these many regiments were formed by exploiting militia. In this battle, the National Army, relying only on its superior firepower, suffered more than nine hundred casualties in vain. When the Battle of Libao was about to end, more than four hundred residents of Libao were taken away by the Communist army as they retreated, undoubtedly cleverly replenishing their military strength.</p>
<p>From this, we come to a conclusion, which is also what Commander Li said: "Why can the Communist Party use the militia to fight us, while we cannot mobilize the masses to fight the Communist Party? The only reason is that the Communist Party has a tight-knit organization in political work." Therefore, if we want to truly ensure security, the military and political authorities must be responsible at each level and strictly observe discipline!</p>
<p>I remember when the reporter group arrived in Haimen, an old man secretly slipped a letter into the reporter's hand from the crowd. Later, when I read it, I deeply felt that this was a consequence of "work not being done well."</p>
<p>The most important point is that the discipline of the local security forces is considered too poor. In fact, this is not only said by the people of Haimen; I have heard similar statements in every corner of Northern Jiangsu. At the same time, a few of the current township and district chiefs are "veterans of three dynasties," truly "experienced" and skilled at "corruption," able to manipulate things to their advantage flawlessly. The people once said with great pain, "We are not afraid of unspeakable suffering, but we are afraid of not daring to speak of suffering." Because the people are clearly suffering losses, if you ask them, they not only dare not speak, but must also endure the pain and pretend to be fine!</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Unveiling a New Page in Sino-Philippine Relations</h3>
<p>The Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship has been agreed upon by both parties and is scheduled to be signed today in Manila by representatives of China and the Philippines. This will not only completely dispel all suspicions and misunderstandings between the two countries and unveil a new page in Sino-Philippine relations, but also provide a reliable guarantee for peace and security in the North Pacific. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship has great significance and deserves our attention. The contents of the treaty are unknown, as the official announcement has not yet been made; however, by looking back and looking ahead, it is not difficult to prove that the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship has very close relations with China, the United States, and the Philippines, and may even have an important impact on the entire Pacific situation.</p>
<p>The initiation of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship dates back to before the Philippines gained formal independence. In November 1945, Duan Maolan, our country's Consul-General in the Philippines, proposed to the U.S. High Commissioner, McNutt, to negotiate a Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship. McNutt first expressed his support and discussed the matter with Philippine President Osmeña; however, since the Philippines had not yet formally gained independence at that time, it was inconvenient to proceed. In June and July 1946, our country took the opportunity of the Philippines formally declaring its independence on July 4th and appointed Gan Naiguang as a special envoy to attend the independence ceremony of the Republic of the Philippines in Manila, and to negotiate the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship with President Roxas and Foreign Minister Quirino. At the same time, in order to celebrate the independence of the Philippines, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also issued a statement on the same day, saying: "As we welcome this new republic, we wish to guarantee that the Chinese government and people will cooperate fully with the Republic of the Philippines, just as with other friendly nations, without any reduction. Sino-Philippine cooperation is essential, not only to enhance the well-being of both countries, but also to establish a spirit of mutual support in the Far East, so as to ensure world peace and progress." The Chinese government's sincere hope to conclude a treaty of friendship with the Republic of the Philippines can be clearly demonstrated in Foreign Minister Wang's statement.</p>
<p>The treaty negotiations between China and the Philippines began on July 7th of last year and were initially very smooth. The Philippine government, after discussing the draft treaty of friendship proposed by our country, also expressed its support in principle. In theory, it could be signed as soon as our country's first envoy to the Philippines took office; however, the Philippine government proposed two amendments to be added to the treaty: (1) that the contracting country, as a sovereign state, has the right to promulgate any laws; and that the nationals of the other contracting country have the obligation to abide by them; (2) that the Philippines should grant the United States privileges that China should not enjoy. These amendments were clearly contrary to the spirit of friendship and were not acceptable to our country; therefore, the Sino-Philippine treaty negotiations effectively came to a standstill. Although Philippine President Roxas still declared on August 30th of last year that "China and the Philippines should maintain friendship forever," the signing of the treaty of friendship was postponed indefinitely. Only due to practical needs, a temporary agreement had to be established first for civil aviation between the two countries, while permanent agreements required long-term consideration, and these agreements could not be produced first without the signing of a treaty of friendship.</p>
<p>Since then, the treaty negotiations have been deadlocked, and the Philippines' "unfriendly behavior" towards our overseas Chinese has become increasingly severe. We do not want to elaborate on this unfortunate episode between China and the Philippines, but we can summarize the various measures taken by the Philippines to harm the interests of our overseas Chinese as follows: (1) the Philippine National Assembly's proposed "Philippinization of Labor" bill, which forced overseas Chinese to employ Filipinos, accounting for 60% of all employees; (2) the "Philippinization of Retail" bill, which prohibited overseas Chinese from being retailers; (3) the "Philippinization of Vendors" bill, which advocated that overseas Chinese should not be vendors; (4) reducing the quota for Chinese immigrants to the Philippines to one-tenth of the original number. In addition, the Philippine authorities' atrocities against overseas Chinese, arbitrarily arresting overseas Chinese, and illegally searching overseas Chinese newspaper offices are too numerous to mention. At that time, our government, on the one hand, cherished the friendship between China and the Philippines, and on the other hand, seeing that a nation that had just been liberated from years of oppression was also embarking on this wrong path, had to repeatedly advise the non-government not to forget the contributions of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines to the development and prosperity of the Philippines over the past decades, and even more not to forget the glory of the overseas Chinese participating in guerrilla warfare and fighting side by side with the U.S.-Philippine Allied forces.</p>
<p>After our government's repeated advice, the Philippine authorities also deeply realized that future international relations should be an era of trustworthiness and morality, especially between China and the Philippines. President Roxas was most aware of this. Our country's envoy to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, returned to the country in November of last year to seek instructions, and after returning to his post, the talk of China and the Philippines reopening negotiations and signing a new treaty once again became widespread. Until February of this year, the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly sent a new draft treaty to our embassy, which overturned all the results of the months of negotiations between the two parties. As the saying goes, there were many twists and turns, and the Sino-Philippine negotiations were once again deadlocked. Therefore, our government had no choice but to issue a strong note to the Philippines, stating that under these circumstances, it had to temporarily suspend the negotiations. This wise measure was not only unanimously praised by our overseas Chinese in the Philippines, but also able to awaken the awareness of the Philippine government and people. The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs then submitted a reply, stating that the Philippines was prepared to continue discussions, which our country considered; however, the discussions must still be based on the terms that had already been agreed upon. On the 9th of this month, the Sino-Philippine negotiations finally reopened in Baguio.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see how many trials and tribulations the negotiation of a treaty of friendship between China and the Philippines has undergone. Now, it can finally be said that overcoming the difficulties and reaching an agreement is a victory for the conscience of the Chinese and Philippine people. The peace and security of the Pacific depend on the full cooperation of China, the United States, and the Philippines; this is a matter of course and cannot be denied. Even in the current situation in the Philippines, although the Philippines has achieved independence politically, it still relies on the support of the United States in national defense. According to the U.S.-Philippine military agreement, although the seven islands of the Philippines are entirely built by themselves for national defense, the United States still retains its bases for its naval and air forces; from this point of view, the Philippines' true independence and autonomy still require a period of effort. We believe that if the Philippines wants to simultaneously achieve economic autonomy and political independence, cooperation with China to jointly maintain peace and prosperity in the Pacific is indeed an indispensable factor. Philippine politicians should broaden their horizons, use their wisdom, and strive to promote the friendship between China and the Philippines. We only hope that Sino-Philippine diplomacy, from the day of the signing of the treaty of friendship today, can truly unveil its new page!</p>

<h3>The US, USSR, and Italy Disagree on How to Convene Future Peace Conference with Germany; German Peace Treaty to be Drafted by Four Powers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th] According to the Soviet proposal, our country should be listed after the Four Powers, but before other countries that fought Germany in the list of countries that should participate in the German peace conference. The proposal also argues that Albania should also attend the German peace conference. The Soviet proposal has only received support from France. According to the US proposal, 53 countries should participate in the German peace conference. Molotov opposed the US proposal, arguing that the US-proposed constitution would include Turkey, the Philippines, and Uruguay. The four foreign ministers formally agreed that the German contract should only be drafted by the four powers that signed the German surrender. The Soviets and British argue that the appropriate German government should sign the contract. The US suggests that the treaty should state in the German constitution that it is only based on a peaceful solution agreed upon by the Allies. Milotov believes that the signing of the German government is essential, as Germany must have a responsible body to implement the treaty's stipulated terms, just as the treaties signed by its dependent countries. The Japanese government is considered qualified to sign the treaty, so why should Germany be an exception? Marshall suggested a compromise that Germany would accept the treaty when its situation was sufficiently developed to consider a clear peace settlement. Bevin was prepared to accept Marshall's suggestion. Bevin then asked if there was an agreement on inviting China to the peace conference. Molotov said that he had expressed his opinion, but no agreement was reached.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 12th] The question of whether China should be invited to the German peace conference remained unresolved at today's meeting of the four foreign ministers due to the strong opposition of the Soviet representative.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] The foreign ministers' representatives continued to discuss the points of contention in the German peace conference procedure this afternoon, but some difficulties have been reduced, but the principles remain unchanged. The most effective contribution was the suggestion made by the British delegation to divide the light and advisory committees into two committees. The members of the advisory committee should be the Four Powers, Germany's neighboring allied countries, and other countries that participated in the German war with troops, including Iran. The intelligence committee should be organized by the Four Powers and all other countries that declared war on Germany. The task of the intelligence committee is to obtain information and documents on the German contract negotiations, and the advisory committee can submit written opinions on this information and documents.</p>
<p>This proposal can properly resolve the issue of whether or not Iran should participate.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers Agree to Discuss Four-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 12th] The foreign ministers agreed today to discuss the U.S.-proposed 40-year National Defense Treaty on the 14th, dealing with the last difficult problem of the foreign ministers' meeting. At the same time, the foreign ministers agreed to return some of the German issues to the foreign ministers' representatives and the Berlin Allied Control Council for discussion, pending the foreign ministers' meeting again in a few months. This is the first time that the Soviet Union has unified this type of procedural issue, which shows that the deadlock on major issues will not be opened in this meeting. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France agree with the four-nation treaty, which the Soviet Union has opposed so far. If an agreement cannot be reached, the foreign ministers will lose the last opportunity for compromise on major issues. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall attaches particular importance to the four-nation treaty. It is said that if the four countries can unite to prevent German aggression, there is no need to worry about the issue of security, and countries will be more willing to make concessions on economic issues such as the Soviet Union's request to raise Germany's industrial level and extract compensation from current German production. If the Soviet Union refuses to sign the treaty, the United States' attitude towards this difficult problem may become tougher. At today's meeting, the foreign ministers also agreed to implement German land reform before the end of this year, destroy all German defense projects before December 31st of next year, and clean up all German wartime factories before June 30th of next year.</p>
<h3>Molotov Hosts Banquet for Yugoslav Representatives</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 12th] Moscow Radio has just broadcast the news that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hosted a banquet today for Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kartel and Foreign Minister Simic.</p>
<h3>France's Position Conforms to the Hopes of Belgium</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Belgian Capital, 12th] The Belgian Rhine Issue Research Committee issued a communiqué today stating that French Foreign Minister Bidault's position at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting on three important issues—the western border of Germany, the legal status of the Rhineland, and the legal status of the Saarland—coincides with Belgium's hopes. The committee believes that the Belgian government will be able to effectively protect the country's security needs in the above-mentioned three areas.</p>
<h3>France Demands the Port of Kehl</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that Foreign Minister Pidault's demand at the Moscow meeting for the Port of Kehl, opposite Strasbourg on the banks of the Rhine, was purely based on economic motives. The port is connected to Strasbourg by a drawbridge. France does not want to separate the port from Germany politically, but demands that the port be used by the French in order to cooperate closely with Strasbourg. During the occupation, France initiated the joint use of the two ports, and the results were quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Reduced in Hungary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 12th] The rapid reduction of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary, and the Soviet government's request to the Hungarian government to allow it to set up consulates in several cities in Hungary, show that the occupation state is eager to end as soon as possible. The first consulate is planned to be set up in Gyor, and four other cities will also be set up at an opportune moment. The total number of staff is about one hundred. Today, the total number of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary is between 50,000 and 60,000. During the highest period, it was estimated that the losses had reached 1.2 million to 1.5 million people. Hungary's burden of being occupied today is not very heavy. The people do not feel restricted, there are not many Soviet soldiers on the streets, and incidents of disputes rarely occur. However, those who want to go to Hungary to defend themselves must, in addition to holding a Hungarian passport, also hold an exit permit issued by the Soviet authorities. However, the inspection of documents is not carried out by Soviet soldiers, but by Hungarian officials.</p>
<h3>British Business Delegation to Visit Moscow This Month</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 12th] It has just been learned that a British business delegation, led by Wilson, the Minister of Foreign Trade, plans to visit Moscow at the end of this month to negotiate a trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union with the Soviet authorities. Since the end of the war, Anglo-Soviet trade relations have virtually stagnated. Until recently, the British Ministry of Food reached an agreement with the Soviet Union, under which the Soviet Union will import 150,000 boxes of canned salmon and 25,000 boxes of canned crab into the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Turkish Newspaper Clarifies the Country's Wartime Stance</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Ankara, 12th] The semi-official agency "Ulus" published today that Turkey was prepared to participate in the war in 1944, but the United States officially notified the Turkish government that it did not want to open another war zone in the Balkan Peninsula, which did not materialize. The Cairo Conference in 1943 was in line with the Anglo-Turkish alliance treaty. Therefore, the reason why Turkey did not participate in the war was due to the three powers, not Turkey itself. In addition, the United Kingdom did not fulfill its promise to supply Turkey with military equipment and equipment, which also made it impossible for Turkey to fight.</p>
<h3>Soviet Fleet Makes Long March</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] Moscow Radio announced today that the Soviet sailing and steamship fleet will depart from Latvia, pass through the Atlantic Ocean, follow the Panama Canal, cross the Pacific Ocean, and return to Bolikhov Port in the Primorsky Krai to join the local Soviet Pacific Yuchuan Team. This long march of the Soviet fleet is unprecedented in decades.</p>
<h3>Danish King's Condition Worsens</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Copenhagen, 12th] Danish King Christian's condition has worsened, his fever has increased, and his mind has become confused tonight. Four royal doctors are on standby to inject him with penicillin.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Meeting Has Lasted More Than Five Weeks; No Major Issues Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 13th] The foreign ministers' meeting has been held for five weeks and remains as deadlocked as ever. The only development in the past week has been the stalemate over the unresolved report of the Allied Control Council, which has turned into a stalemate over the issue of Germany's borders. The only agreement in the three days of discussion on the border issue was the principle that the Allies' land claims against Germany should first be submitted to the foreign ministers for review and to a committee of experts for study. However, the Soviet Union still insisted that the Polish-German border had been clearly stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and could not be overturned and should not be included in the discussion, while the United Kingdom, the United States, and France believed that the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement were temporary. Another major unresolved point is France's request to incorporate the Saarland into its economic sphere, and Molotov said that further study is needed. When Marshall discussed the Hull issue at yesterday's meeting, he hinted that he hoped to re-discuss the issue of German economic unity after the agenda of the foreign ministers' meeting was completed, which shows that the four powers have not completely given up hope of reaching an agreement on this major issue. Some observers believe that this foreign ministers' meeting should at least be able to reach a resolution on the pivot of redetermining Germany's industrial level, because if the foreign ministers' meeting wants to frequently issue instructions to the Allied Control Council to enable the Allied executive authorities to continue to work on a four-power basis, the issue of industrial level must be resolved first.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Meeting Decided to Abandon Discussion on the Issue of Germany's Future Political System</h3>
<p>[Hezhong News Agency, Moscow, 12th] The foreign ministers' meeting decided today to abandon the hope of reaching an agreement on the issue of Germany's future political system at this meeting, and resolved to send this issue, as well as many minor issues, to the foreign ministers' meeting and the Allied Control Council in Germany for discussion, and ordered that they be completed before the next foreign ministers' meeting. This move indicates that after extensively discussing all issues, the four foreign ministers have decided not to discuss all the minor issues on the agenda, but to re-discuss the basic issues such as compensation, economic unity, and borders. The important resolution of today's foreign ministers' meeting is that the foreign ministers agreed not to mention the nature, form, and scope of the German interim government for the time being.</p>
<h3>Potential Crisis in Portugal: Army on High Alert</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lisbon, 12th] Thousands of dockworkers in Lisbon have been on strike for two weeks without returning to work. Other workers are joining in, seemingly with the intention of forcing Prime Minister Salazar to concede or resign through a general strike. The Portuguese army has been ordered to remain in barracks, ready to be deployed to suppress any unrest. Sources say that there is also unrest within the Portuguese army. Four senior officers were reportedly transferred to the Cape Verde Islands and Madeira yesterday. Officially, they were reassigned to positions there, but in reality, they were considered troublemakers and transferred elsewhere. Recently, several military aircraft were sabotaged at Sintra airport. Yesterday, telephone lines between Lisbon and the north were also cut. The government's response to the labor unrest and underlying turmoil is that it is being instigated by communists and hopes that workers will not be misled by international communist conspirators. The authorities are adopting a high-pressure policy towards the strikers, with armed police densely deployed in working-class areas. Anyone seen gathering in groups is dispersed with batons. Lisbon station is heavily guarded, and the situation in the factory district across the river is extremely tense.</p>
<h3>Churchill Praises Truman's Aid Plan for Greece and Turkey, Says Soviet Union Dares Not Rashly Start a War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] In the second of two articles written for the "New York Times" and "Life Magazine," Churchill stated in an article on Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey that the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth would unanimously welcome the establishment of Anglo-American power in the Middle East. Churchill said that the United Kingdom is currently unable to maintain stability in the Middle East alone. He generally stated, "Accompanying the decline of British power is the rise of Soviet demands." Churchill believes that the Soviet Union will not attempt to realize its wishes through war in the near future. According to Churchill, the Soviet Union desires peace and prosperity, not war. Churchill continued, "If there is no significant opposition, the Soviet Union will be subjected to severe pressure from external forces and internal communist conspiracies. If the Soviet Union faces resistance in the diplomatic field, to the extent that it may lead to a major war with a country of equal or greater strength, in my view, the Soviet Union will not aggressively and forcibly implement its policies and ambitions in the coming years, causing the situation to approach the point of explosion." In conclusion, Churchill called on English-speaking countries to adopt a unified policy towards Soviet expansion in the Mediterranean. Churchill said, "May we move forward side by side in full understanding and friendship. If we split, we may all be fragmented and destroyed. If we unite under a world organization, we may be able to save free civilization and democracy, and even eliminate the evils of war from humanity forever." As in his first article, Churchill reviewed his policies towards Greece in 1944 and 1945. He believes that the policies he implemented at that time were identical to those adopted by the Truman administration two years later.</p>
<h3>US Representatives Stationed in Greece and Turkey for Fact-Finding</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 13th] US Democratic Senator Barkley stated at a press conference in Cairo yesterday that the loans granted by the United States to Greece and Turkey may be voted on by the end of next week. The delegation led by Barkley, consisting of four members of the House of Representatives from both the Democratic and Republican parties, is currently in Greece and Turkey gathering information about the situation in both countries. At the press conference, all the representatives emphasized that US aid to Greece and Turkey has no imperialistic intentions. They stated that the United States has no intention of seizing political or economic privileges, citing US policy towards China as an example. The only desire of the United States is to assist in the economic reconstruction of Greece and Turkey to stabilize their political situations, which is a necessary measure to maintain world peace. The Republican representative further emphasized that the expansion of Soviet labor must be curbed. They stated that the Soviet Union has annexed more territory in Europe than any other controlling nation, and since it participated in the war in Asia, its expansionist power should be curbed. It is reported that the delegation will travel to Istanbul tomorrow before heading to Greece.</p>
<p>American Aircraft Supply Turkey</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 13th] Several American Mustang fighter planes flew to Turkey, passing through the West Ampino airport. After refueling, they immediately took off. This is the first time the United States has provided aid to Turkey.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Scholarship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Roosevelt Presidential Memorial Scholarship was officially announced today, to be awarded to international students in memory of the late President Roosevelt. The statement said that the scholarship will enable students from around the world to study and understand the American people and their way of life in the United States, and to spread their knowledge to their home countries upon their return. The statement did not mention the exact amount and the date of establishment.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 12th] In today's routine broadcast to the Soviet Union, the State Department had a program commemorating the late President Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt delivered a speech to the Soviet Union, saying, "I hope that the terrible destruction suffered by your country during the war will be quickly restored, and that the rewards you earned for fighting alongside our people to defeat the invaders will also be reaped."</p>
<h3>Special Session of the UN General Assembly: 26 Countries Have Agreed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] The United Nations announced today that it has received affirmative responses from 26 member states. With two more countries voting in favor, a special session of the General Assembly can be officially convened on April 28 to discuss the explosive Palestinian issue.

<h3>Truman's Popularity is Rising, Gaining the Support of Most People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] President Truman is now in his third year in office, and his popularity is rising. Most people in the country support his new foreign policy and middle-of-the-road domestic policy. Truman's popularity declined in the early days of his administration. By October of last year, only 32% of the people approved of his policies, and the Republicans won the election the following month. Since then, Truman has regained his past popularity. Recent polls show that 60% of the people approve of his measures. Truman's renewed popularity is largely due to: (1) Defeating the coal miners' leader Lewis, forcing him to comply and end his strike against government control of the mines; (2) His middle-of-the-road domestic policies; (3) The appointment of Marshall as Secretary of State; (4) His successful visit to Mexico. Truman's plan to prevent the spread of communism is being supported by Congress.</p>

<h3>The Key to the Success or Failure of the Moscow Conference: An Analysis of the German Reparations Issue</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>Although the four-power foreign ministers' conference being held in Moscow is centered on the German question, this conference is unlikely to produce a German treaty. At most, the four foreign ministers will reach a decision on whether Germany should move towards unification or remain divided for a long period of time. It is even uncertain whether this outcome can be achieved.</p>
<p>United Nations diplomats insist that the four powers must first reach an agreement on current German problems before deciding on the future of Germany. Disputes that have divided the United Nations' occupation policy for twenty-one months will be the focus of discussions at the Moscow conference.</p>
<p>The proposal by the UK and the US to immediately implement economic unification in Germany will be opposed by the Soviet Union and France. The Soviet Union insists on first obtaining $10 billion in reparations from Germany. France advocates establishing a weak central government first, creating a loose federation in Germany.</p>
<p>Other obstacles include the difficult issues of eradicating Nazi ideology, disarmament, and democratization. The United Nations Control Commission in Berlin has spent a year and a half discussing these issues and recently announced that it could not find a solution. Without the four powers reaching a consensus, there cannot be much progress in drafting a German treaty.</p>
<p>Economic Unification of Germany: The US Desires It Most</p>
<p>The economic unification of Germany is the primary goal that US Secretary of State Marshall seeks at the Moscow conference. The United States has listed this issue as one of the most important items on the agenda of the Moscow conference for the following four important reasons: First, the United States believes that if Germany remains divided for a long time, the conflict between the eastern and western blocs will inevitably lead to another world war. If economic unification is delayed further, Germany will move towards permanent division, causing Europe to be divided into two major blocs, vying to embrace the Germans. Second, as this situation evolves, German Nazis may cleverly resurface under new guises. German nationalists are exploiting the weaknesses of the United Nations' divisions and the general public's resentment towards the country's fragmentation. At the same time, economic stagnation and food shortages in Germany are fostering the Nazi ideology that is still spreading everywhere. Third, the barriers between the occupation zones prevent manufacturers from obtaining raw materials and manufactured goods from flowing into ordinary markets, thus hindering industrial reconstruction. In addition, food, labor, and capital are all locked within their respective occupation zones. Fourth, West Germany needs economic assistance and raw material supplies from the UK and the US. The recent merger of the UK and US occupation zones has resulted in total imports of over $600 million this year, plus occupation costs of about $1 billion.</p>
<p>The UK and the US previously advocated economic unification of Germany on the grounds that it would reduce their financial burden. Surplus food and raw materials from the Soviet occupation zone could help revive industry in West Germany. This situation still exists today, but on a smaller scale, because Soviet demands for reparations have reduced the surplus exports from East Germany.</p>
<p>The United States believes that if Western countries agree to the Soviet Union obtaining reparations from current German production, Western countries' expenditures will inevitably increase, and the financial benefits that can be obtained from German unification are relatively small. Unless the UK and the US accept the Soviet Union's demand for reparations—at least in part—the Soviet Union is unlikely to agree to German economic unification.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reparations issue has become the key to the success or failure of the Moscow conference. The Soviet Union's biggest goal at the Moscow conference will be to obtain some of the manufactured goods from West Germany.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Urgently Needs Materials to Make Up for Production Shortfalls</p>
<p>The Soviet Union urgently needs consumer goods, machinery, and transportation equipment to repair all the equipment damaged by the Hitler army. According to the Potsdam Agreement, the factories in the occupation zone have already been massively moved to the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union is extracting reparations from the current production of factories remaining in East Germany.</p>
<p>Because the Soviet Union refuses to accept the economic unification plan, it has not yet received any reparations from West Germany. According to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, one-quarter of the dismantled factories in West Germany should belong to the Soviet Union, for use in the Soviet Union or Poland. However, before the implementation of unification, the UK and the US will not ship any factory equipment out of their occupation zones. To date, less than one percent of the factories in West Germany have been dismantled.</p>
<p>Soviet officials now advocate that Germany should implement economic unification, but first, they require the UK and the US to agree to the principle of obtaining reparations from current production. Secondly, the Soviet Union wants to obtain ample manufactured goods from West Germany to make up for the shortfall in domestic production over the next five to ten years. The total reparations demanded by the Soviet Union are $10 billion, approximately two to three times more than the amount allowed by the Potsdam Agreement.</p>
<p>It is expected that the method of obtaining reparations by the UK and the US in the Moscow conference, after continuous implementation for many years, may cause a large part of Germany's and the Western countries' trade to be permanently seized by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The United States fears repeating the mistakes of the 1920s, when the United States loaned Germany to help with its economic construction, but the burden of reparations forced Germany towards inflation, economic bankruptcy, and nationalism.</p>
<p>United States Congressional leaders oppose any reparations plan that would increase the cost of the US military occupation. They argue that German exports should first be used to pay for the cost of food and raw materials shipped by the UK and the US to Germany.</p>
<p>France is expected to support the Soviet Union's demand to obtain reparations from current production in the Moscow conference. France currently prefers coal and manufactured goods to dismantled factories, because it lacks the technicians, workers, and raw materials to use the factory equipment until much later.</p>
<p>The UK and the US believe that the principles insisted upon by France and the Soviet Union will enable German industry to recover to a higher level than that envisioned by the Potsdam Conference, which is sufficient to deepen the danger of German rearmament. Years later, competition from Germany for markets will be more intense. However, Germany's neighbors, such as the Soviet Union, are more concerned about their current economic difficulties than these future problems.</p>
<p>The Gray Compromise Plan May Break the Stalemate</p>
<p>US Army Commander in Germany, Lieutenant General Gray, offered Marshall a compromise as follows: If the Soviet Union lowers its demands, supplies the raw materials needed by the United States, and agrees to German economic unification, then the UK and the US may accept the principle of obtaining reparations from current production.</p>
<p>Marshall is likely to seek a compromise between the Soviet Union's demands and the views of the US Congress at the Moscow conference. A plan similar to Gray's suggestion may be proposed as a basis for resolving the reparations and economic unification issues. If this is the case, then the four foreign ministers will discuss the procedures for signing a German treaty.</p>
<p>But it is certain that the Moscow conference will not reach an agreement on any of the treaty's terms. In this situation, Marshall is expected to quickly end the meeting and convene another four-power conference after letting it "cool off" for some time. Then the divided situation in Germany seems to be prolonged.</p>
<h3>US Senators Harshly Criticize Wallace's Speech in England, Accusing Him of Lacking Patriotism and Attempting to Oppose the Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The speech by former Vice President Wallace today drew unanimous condemnation from major senators. Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said, "It is appalling for Americans to go abroad and make statements attacking their own government. I believe that the important event is not Mr. Wallace's actions in 1948, but his actions in 1947." This statement clearly refers to Wallace's possible participation in next year's presidential election campaign. Democratic Senator Fulbright said, "I don't know what his intentions are. This man's words sound like they were drafted in the Kremlin." Republican Senator Robertson said, "It is improper for a key figure of our country to go to another country and try to persuade them to oppose their own country's policies. I don't think the British will be fooled by him." Republican Senator Marr said, "President Truman should state that Wallace does not represent anyone, but only speaks for the communist rabble he carries with him." Democratic Senator George said, "Wallace's attitude is greatly detrimental to the goals of our country's policies. Mr. Wallace does not accurately interpret the emotions of the American people and clearly does not understand the thoughts of his fellow citizens."</p>
<h3>Wallace's Remarks: Says He Does Not Intend to Lead a New Party</h3>
<p>[United Press, Stoke-on-Trent, England, 13th] Since arriving in England, former US Vice President Wallace has delivered his third speech at the United Nations Association, declaring that he himself will not lead a third-party movement in the United States. However, he said that the movement could be led by Democratic Senator Pepper, who is an excellent liberal senator. When asked if he intended to run for president in 1948 as a third-party candidate, Wallace replied that the state election laws have created a situation that makes it impossible for a third party to gain power, and therefore, no one dares to try lightly. However, if things become extremely conservative, a new party may emerge and gain considerable influence in one election, with the hope of winning in the next election. Wallace predicted that the Moscow foreign ministers' conference will fail on fundamental issues, and the upcoming international trade preparatory conference in Geneva will also fail.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 12th] Wallace, whose visit to England has attracted global attention, is scheduled to fly to Goteborg on the 17th and deliver a speech there the following day. His itinerary includes a speech in Oslo on the 19th, a speech in Copenhagen on the 21st, and in Paris on the 22nd. He will fly back to the United States from Paris on the 25th.</p>

<h3>US Ready to Participate in Negotiations to Improve the Situation in Korea: MacArthur Releases Latest Report on the Situation in Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, United Press] Following Marshall's explosive remarks in Moscow that the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility for Korea's economic difficulties, MacArthur today released his latest report on the situation in Korea, stating that the US members of the US-Soviet Joint Commission are in Seoul, ready to participate in discussions to improve the situation. According to MacArthur's previous report, US Commander-in-Chief in Korea Hodge has made it clear to the Soviet side that the US firmly believes that the Korean people should have the freedom to express their opinions on the establishment of their own provisional government. Marshall pointed out in Moscow that the Soviet Commander in Korea insists on a principle that would exclude most of the leading Korean representatives in the consultation to organize a provisional government. It is recalled that US officials in Korea have repeatedly attempted to reopen the commission, as Marshall is now requesting in Moscow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, Associated Press] MacArthur stated in his latest report on the activities of the US military government in Korea that since the opening of the interim legislative assembly, the people of South Korea have completed "the greatest step in the democratic progress of self-governance." He also stated that the US representatives of the US-Soviet Joint Commission have remained in Seoul, ready to participate in discussions of all appropriate issues at any time. This indicates that the United States is willing to discuss the Korean issue whenever the Soviet representatives are willing to attend the meeting.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Suddenly Leaves New Delhi, Rumored to Disagree with Nehru</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th] Indian Mahatma Gandhi suddenly left for the province of Bihar tonight after a meeting with the Governor-General of India, Lord Mountbatten, yesterday. According to the National Congress Party, the Mahatma's sudden departure was due to disagreements between himself and Deputy Prime Minister Nehru of the Indian Interim Government regarding the future status of Jinnah, chairman of the Muslim League. Gandhi proposed that Jinnah be appointed president of future Indian politics, in order to force him to cooperate with the National Congress Party and create a unified India. It is reported that Nehru strongly opposed this proposal, believing that Gandhi was too idealistic and lacked contact with political reality. Gandhi traveled to Bihar Province by third-class train.

Sources say that the Governor's efforts to get the Muslim League to participate in the constitutional assembly have had little success, but it is expected that Mountbatten will not be discouraged and will continue to negotiate in order to reach an agreement for India as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Stop Food Relief for Yellow River Control</h3>
<p>To date, more than 65 percent of the grain shipped by UNRRA to the Executive Yuan in China has been distributed by the Executive Yuan to various local branches for relief. Since UNRRA is about to end, and the remaining grain component is not much, the source of grain in the future is extremely limited, and the relief work in various places has to be tightened to cooperate. It is reported that the more than 30,000 tons of grain shipped by UNRRA to China in April have been fully shipped, and the Executive Yuan has also allocated them one after another. The General Office has also approved that all grain relief in various places will be suspended from May this year. For local work-relief or emergency relief work, such as those that have already started and are indeed needed, they may be considered and coordinated to complete them within their capabilities. Other long-term and non-urgent needs or newly organized work-relief matters will not be accepted and will be gradually transferred to the competent local authorities for handling. As for the only 20,000 tons of grain to be shipped by UNRRA next month (i.e., May), the Executive Yuan will reserve it for the Yellow River flooding area for yellow river control and disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Prices Secretly Creeping Up: Oil, Rice, and Grains Lead the Surge, Silk Shops and North-South Goods Stores Prosper</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The emergency economic measures had stabilized prices for over forty days, but in the recent days of this month, prices are secretly creeping up again. The authorities are also gradually paying attention, and alarming terms such as "suppress price increases" and "price limits" have reappeared in the newspapers, causing general citizens to feel fear and unease again.</p>
<p>This time, it is oil, rice, and grains that are leading the "price surge." Late last month, a millet shop near the reporter used a red paper of more than ten feet high to write "Buy five dou of white rice and get one jin of flour for free," and posted it at the gate. When the reporter passed by yesterday, he noticed that the red paper had long been swept away cleanly. The four major companies on Nanjing Road and other silk and cloth shops, North-South goods stores, and various shops have suddenly become prosperous again. Housewives are everywhere inquiring about the prices of daily necessities, asking which store has not increased prices, or has increased them less, and rushing to buy more. In response to the surge in daily necessities, they have reached a conclusion in the experience of the entire ten years and more from the beginning of the War of Resistance to today after the victory, which is "Buy quickly, buy as much as possible, and use up all the money."</p>
<p>Rice: The authorities have set a price limit of 140,000 yuan per dan for rice, but in fact, 140,000 yuan can only buy the lowest quality broken rice per dan. The best quality white japonica rice is only available to familiar old customers, and the price is negotiated on the spot, usually around 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. "High-quality goods" sold at retail also cost 150,000 yuan per dan, and second-class goods cost 146,000 yuan. This is the market situation for the day before yesterday. After the price limit of 250,000 yuan per dan for cooking oil, oil merchants shouted the slogan of insufficient cost. General medical gardens or grocery stores that also sell cooking oil still charge 4,120 yuan per jin of raw oil.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Cigarettes are also a type that has increased sharply. Morris cigarettes retail for 3,100 yuan per pack. If you smoke one pack every day, you will spend nearly 100,000 yuan per month. Huang Xi Bao cigarettes were sold for 13,000 yuan per tin three days ago, but yesterday they cost 18,000 to 19,000 yuan. 35 Brand, which originally sold for 20,000 yuan, has also risen to 28,000 yuan. Since the black market exchange rate for US dollars has risen from 11,800 yuan to 16,000 to 17,000 yuan, "foreign goods" have also been noticed and purchased. Carnation milk powder, one pound package, costs 21,000 yuan each, and experienced milk powder customers still unanimously believe that "it has not risen enough."</p>
<p>Western Medicine: The price increase of Western medicine is also quite fierce. Yesterday evening at 8 o'clock, the reporter went to a pharmacy next to the Hongmiao Temple to buy tablet penicillin, and inquired that the price of a bottle of 15 tablets was 40,000 yuan. But ten minutes later, when he got the money to buy it, the price was asked for 50,000 yuan. Not only did they not recognize the price agreed upon ten minutes ago, but they also said: "We didn't want to sell it in the first place." This has simply reached the point of hoarding and profiteering.</p>
<p>In the tram, the reporter heard the conversation of three industrial workers. A said: "Yesterday I called a rickshaw from Dapu Bridge to Avenue Joffre, and the rickshaw puller insisted on 3,000 yuan, even 2,500 yuan was not enough. He said that 3,000 yuan is just the price of two sheng of rice." B said: "Yes! After the cost of living index was frozen, wages did not increase, but prices are increasing every day. I really don't understand what the municipal government is doing." C shook his head and said: "I don't know how the Social Affairs Bureau will calculate this month's allowance (i.e., differential allowance). Don't come up with another 73,000 yuan."</p>

<h3>Regulations on Deferred Conscription Scope for Current Police Personnel: Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Receives Instructions</h3>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters: It has been found that the current conscription law no longer has provisions for police deferment of conscription or recall, but among the current police personnel, there are many active and eligible men, and in fact, there are also those who should not be conscripted. In order to avoid repeating the recruitment and supplementation of police with conscription in the future, it is appropriate to determine the scope in order to simultaneously plan for building the army and building the police. It has been reported to the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior (36) Cheng Jian An Yi Yin Yang telegram, which instructs the following on the deferment of conscription and recall for current police officers:</p>

Otherwise, once they are drawn, they should still be conscripted according to law. (2) Students and staff of central and various levels of police officer schools who are undergoing training will be temporarily deferred from conscription. (3) During wartime mobilization, current police officers and senior police officers who do not meet the deferment of recall regulations stipulated in the conscription law shall not be conscripted. (4) Tax police, salt police, mining police, fishing police, forestry police, reclamation police, road police, judicial police, aviation police, and guards of various agencies and schools, prison guards, etc., and various special police, shall all be handled in accordance with the above interpretation.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Traffic Control: Police Bureau Establishes Control Room for Zoned Mobile Command</h3>
<p>The city's traffic problem has always been valued by the valley side, but due to the narrow roads of congenital conditions, the surge in vehicles after the war (more than 90,000 vehicles before the war, more than 150,000 vehicles at the time of victory, and now increased to more than 240,000 vehicles), the cancellation of the area restrictions in the concession era, the complexity of vehicle types, and the fact that violation fines have no warning effect due to the depreciation of currency values, and other objective factors, the municipal government's painstaking planning is still difficult to achieve improvement results. In order to strengthen the control effect, the Municipal Police Bureau will establish a traffic control room on the 16th of this month, with the director of the administrative office of the bureau concurrently serving as the director of the room. A large team of traffic police will be established under the room, with Zhang Yuanjing as the captain. Capable police officers will be transferred and divided into 30 small groups to regularly conduct zoned mobile command of traffic, breaking the old rules of "only knowing point control and ignoring line guidance," so that the chaotic market may achieve the actual effect of rectification.</p>
<h3>Living in a Boat and Losing Everything: Boatman Stealing a Daughter's Clothes in a Suitcase Accidentally Led to Solving the Case</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Kunqu actress Wang Baolian and Qipai veteran actor Chen Hefeng performed together along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and were well received. During the lunar first month, when they were performing at the Jiaxing Grand Theater in Jiaxing, because there was also a housing shortage in the area, it was not easy to find a house to live in for a while, so they rented a day boat as a temporary residence, living and eating there.

<h3>Our Newspaper's Second Weekly Broadcast Yesterday: Li Shizeng Speaks on the Problem of Socialization</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Our newspaper broadcasted a full-day broadcast program at the Jindu Radio Station yesterday, and invited party and state elder Li Shihui (see picture) to broadcast "The Problem of Socialization." Mr. Li recently married Ms. Lin Sushan, and after their marriage, they went to Hong Kong for their honeymoon. Yesterday, they both came together. The full text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"The problem of socialization can be said to be very simple, and it can also be said to be very complicated. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee this year have both had proposals on socialization. In addition, various publications and newspapers have also discussed it a lot. Now, I will only give a simple and clear explanation in a short period of time. The so-called socialization, judging from the literal meaning of these three words, can already understand the general idea. However, socialization can be said from various aspects, and can be studied, tested, and implemented from various aspects. On a small scale, the psychology and behavior of an individual or an individual are also related to socialization, which can be said to be the problem of individual socialization. On a larger scale,</p>
<p>family, economy, politics, and culture all have problems of socialization. On an even larger scale, it is the socialization of the world. Therefore, the scope of socialization is extremely large and all-encompassing. Now I will talk about two points: one is political socialization, and the other is economic socialization. Everyone knows that politics and economics are inseparable. Now the political and economic systems of the world are divided into (1) private capital system, which is an economic and political system, which is actually a past system, at least it is a past system in trend. (2)</p>
<p>social system. This system is currently only being tested locally, and many are not truly socialized. For example, the systems of the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany in the past are not true but false socialization. Their systems can be said to be national socialism. Although they are implementing a social system, they concentrate the highest power in the state. Therefore, there are only private capital systems and national systems in the world today. Neither of these two systems is what we need. Only a truly social system is the most important, the most advanced, and the most moderate system. Society is all-encompassing, including individuals and the country, but society should be the most important, and sociality should be the most important. The social system does not obliterate individual rights, but because individuals cannot be separated from society, individual needs should be limited. Similarly, the country is also part of society and has its necessary responsibilities, one of which is national defense. Of course, after achieving true socialization and true peace in the world,</p>
<p>the national defense problem can be reduced. But today, even the collective security measures of the United Nations are still inseparable from national defense, so heavy industry must be done by the state. Other economic construction must also be concentrated in the state. The meaning of socialization is that at a time when the private capital system has not completely passed and the country still has to take on the task of national defense, at least it can start a social system movement. In Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the Principle of Democracy belongs to the political aspect, and the Principle of People's Livelihood is the problem of socialization. The Principle of People's Livelihood is closely related to socialization. Mr. Sun said that the Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism, but there are various kinds of socialism. What Mr. Sun said is certainly not the Soviet or German style, but a socialized system, a doctrine of the socialized way, so it is a commentary on the social livelihood doctrine."</p>
<h3>Famous Actors Will Sing Pingju and Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>In addition to inviting Li Shizeng to broadcast during the day, our newspaper's second special broadcast held last night also gathered many wonderful programs, and there were also many famous actors singing Pingju and Kunqu Opera in the evening. The Pingju program was "Si Lang Visits His Mother," with Mr. Fan Shiren as Si Lang, Miss Yuan Lingyun as the Princess, Mr. Huang Jingbo as the Empress Dowager, Mr. He Shixi as Yang Zongbao, Mr. Tang Shouqian as Liu Lang, and Mr. Xu Ziyun as She Taijun, all of whom were the best of the time. In addition, there were excerpted Qingchang, including Mr. Zhang Shihuan's "Execution of Zi at Yuanmen" and Miss Zhu Min's "Baolian Lantern," both of which were masterpieces. Kunqu Opera was "Autumn River" from "The Jade Hairpin," sung by Yin Zhenxian and Zhu Yaowen, "Ballad of Eternal Life," "Qiao Vinegar" from "The West Chamber," "Looking Homeward" from "The Shepherd's Tale," and "Visiting Su" from "The Red Pear," which were played by Fan Boyan, Ye Xiaohong, Zhou Yunxuan, Fan Boyan, and Miss Liu Xuanyuan in turn. The wonderful tunes were presented one after another, and the elegant rhymes were about to flow, which was truly a rare concert. It is said that there will be more wonderful dramas sung by famous actors Yang Wannong and Shen Bonian in the next issue.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou Dispatch] All the students of Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou Normal School recently published a written opinion on improving normal education, divided into four items: (1) Propose to grant normal school students opportunities for further education. (2) Improve the treatment of normal school students while in school. (3) For the service of normal school students, it is proposed to provide practical guarantees.

<h3>Tangshan Engineering College Army Difficulties Expected to be Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tangshan Air Dispatch] Tangshan Engineering College, which has been impoverished for years, has shown signs of improvement after the joint efforts of teachers and students inside and outside the school. Recently, the college received a letter from the Nanjing Alumni Association, reporting on solutions to the difficulties. The original intention of the letter was to respond to several points suggested by more than 150 students of the college to the Alumni Association. After discussion by the Nanjing Alumni Association, the following four points were listed: (1) Regarding the improvement of professor treatment, after alumni Mao Yisheng, Li Zhongnang, and Zhang Jianming negotiated with the Ministry of Education and the government, the Ministry of Education agreed to include the college in the list of twenty-one colleges and universities to be upgraded to the original standard. Therefore, the treatment of professors at the college can be included in the second level. (2) Regarding the addition of instruments, books, and factory equipment, the Ministry of Education was unable to agree due to financial constraints. In addition to alumni raising funds separately, the Ministry of Communications has agreed to assist with 400 million yuan for expanding equipment. (3) As for the recruitment of more professors, alumni in Beijing and Shanghai have made every effort to find them and are urging the old professors who are still staying in Beijing and Shanghai to return to Tangshan as soon as possible. The letter ended by mentioning the issue of the president's selection. In today's situation of financial constraints and turmoil, hiring someone from outside the school to take on this position may not be as ideal, and President Gu has been in office for many years, with scholarship and morality sufficient to be a role model. Therefore, the association's opinion is unanimously to retain Gu as president.</p>

<h3>Letter to Mr. Shu Xincheng</h3>
<p>— Liu Liuying</p>
<p>——Providing Some Humble Opinions on How to Promote Electrified Education</p>
<p>I participated in your second electrified education symposium on the evening of the 6th and heard some of your conversations. Although it was just some, it made me feel a lot, and I felt that there were some words, like a bone stuck in my throat, that I really wanted to pour out. However, I didn't have anyone to talk to because the theme of your conversation was to use movies and slides for the "literacy" movement; and what I wanted to express was another aspect, and it would take a long time to explain, so providing it in writing seemed more appropriate, so I'm narrating it separately here; I hope you will correct me, I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>A. Promoting Educational Films</p>
<p>Utilization of educational films: Since November 19 last year, when the Executive Yuan announced the "Revised Interim Measures for Import Trade," the promotion of electrified education has been greatly hit, and all parties engaged in this work have tasted all kinds of hardships. After a lot of effort, appealing to the authorities and various parties, although the entire set of tools for electrified education has not yet achieved the goal of smooth import, educational films were finally approved by the Supreme Economic Commission on December 2 of the same year to be excluded from import quotas and allowed to be imported duty-free. Since our financial resources are very limited, and our material resources are hindered by the inability to import smoothly, and the import of these educational films has been obtained through great hardship, then we should adapt to this situation and make full use of foreign educational films.</p>
<p>Reviewing Educational Films: I know that there are already more than 100 kinds of films in the Encyclopedia Britannica textbook that have been imported, but there are still several families producing textbook films and slides from the UK and the US. I believe that a small review committee should be organized to select certain categories that should be imported. With this reviewed catalog, importers, agents, and other electrified education institutions can have a standard to follow when purchasing, so as to avoid wasting financial resources.</p>
<p>Translation of Textbook Films "Teaching Materials": The translation of the Encyclopedia Britannica textbook film teaching materials is being handled by China Bookstore, which has transferred it to China Film Photographic Equipment Supply Company, which is already in contact with the US side. If this can be realized, it will be of great help to the screening of the Encyclopedia Britannica textbook films. With this kind of translated version, there will be a feeling of "two beauties together, two difficulties combined." For audiences with a lower level of English, the film can be screened silently; at the same time, the teacher explains it based on the translated version; this is truly the most ideal thing. This method is simpler and more economical than changing the recording of the film to Mandarin. Of course, recording sound or translating teaching materials for other educational films is also worth considering.</p>
<p>Cinemas Should Show More Educational Films: In order to increase the public's knowledge, this point should be achieved. It is a recognized fact that students enter cinemas. In this kind of place, making them increase their knowledge is also entertainment without forgetting to study. Moreover, there are also dropouts who enter cinemas, which can also make them receive some forced education. These words may seem like a joke and are too unserious, but they are indeed all true.</p>
<p>Efforts Should Be Made to Make the Education Authorities Recognize Educational Films: This is also very important, but it has been neglected. If education authorities, such as principals, head teachers, etc., do not understand or know what educational films are, then they will not try to screen educational films, and the students under their leadership will not have the opportunity to appreciate this treasure trove of knowledge.</p>
<p>B. Film and Broadcasting Should Work Together</p>
<p>Electrified education is by no means a one-sided matter for film. Broadcasting also occupies a very important position. China's broadcasting industry has a long history and considerable equipment. However, it seems that it has not made a sufficiently satisfactory contribution to the promotion of electrified education. The following things seem to be necessary and urgently need to be realized.</p>
<p>Expanding the Electrified Education Symposium: We have held two symposiums, and most of the participants are people from the film industry, so the discussion is also biased towards this aspect. If we want to promote electrified education in two ways, the next symposium, or future symposiums, should invite the broadcasting industry to participate and discuss it together.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Stations Should Be Made More Academic: To achieve this goal, it is best for several newspapers, publishers, schools, and other cultural institutions to jointly assume this responsibility. Since March 17 this year, Shen Bao has created news broadcasts three times a day, which is a new record in China's news industry. Recent radio stations also have academic lectures. But this direction of aerial cultural broadcasting seems to be still too little. How to expand it further and achieve an ideal close to "academic" is very worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Broadcasting and Literacy Movement: Using broadcasting to carry out the literacy movement seems to be labor-saving and has a great effect. If newspapers or magazines are willing to engage in this movement, then pre-publishing some broadcast texts at any time may achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy with half the effort and twice the result.</p>
<p>C. Fundamentally Removing Obstacles to Promoting Electrified Education</p>
<p>The "Revised Interim Measures for Import Trade" is the biggest obstacle to promoting electrified education. I have elaborated on this in detail in the Film and Broadcasting Monthly (combined issue of Volume 5, Numbers 8 and 9) jointly organized by the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education and Jinling University. In short, all tools related to promoting electrified education, except for books, are on the list of prohibited imports according to these interim measures. (The opening up of the import of educational films is a recent event. However, the foreign exchange applied for for this type of goods is still unable to be approved.——This is very puzzling.)</p>
<p>If these interim measures are not amended immediately, electrified education and the "literacy" movement cannot proceed smoothly. This is a fundamental obstacle. We must break through this difficult barrier. We should work in this direction.</p>
<p>What method we should use to achieve this goal is worthy of joint discussion.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 13th Dispatch] Changchun City has recently launched an expanded literacy movement.

<h3>Hansong Team Achieves Victory, Defeating the Soviet Union Three to One</h3>
<p>The Korean Hansong football team traveled to Shanghai for an exhibition match. Yesterday, they made their first appearance against the Soviet team. The Korean team had a successful start, defeating the Soviet Union by a score of three to one. In the first half, the visiting team took the lead with two goals to one. Yesterday afternoon, the Yiguo Stadium was packed with an unusually large crowd, estimated at over 15,000 people, all eager to watch. The Korean Overseas Chinese Support Association specially organized a cheering squad to attend, creating an unprecedented spectacle. Before the game, the Hansong team, led by Li Yongshan and Shen Guoquan, entered the field and stood in front of the grandstand. The Korean cheering squad sang the national anthem and set off firecrackers to encourage the team, and the audience responded with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Garden Team Scores First</p>
<p>When the appointed time arrived, Soviet team captain Robert Stoff presented flowers, which were accepted by visiting team captain Park Gyujeong. Referee Zhang Le, and linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Li Guoyi, took the field to officiate, and a fierce battle began. Hansong kicked off first, with Zheng Nanzhi moving the ball forward to attack. Tie Fu and Niejielin worked together to defend. After a chaotic four minutes, Hansong's Yu Jinghuan launched an offensive from the wing, and Zheng Nanzhi got the ball, taking an initial shot that went slightly wide. The Soviets launched a counterattack, with Tie Fu passing long to the left corner. Nogokov broke through one-on-one, and the visiting team's defense failed to stop him, resulting in a one-to-zero lead for the Soviet Union. Unhappy with conceding the first goal, the visiting team, led by Kim Yongshik, launched an attack. Yu Jinghuan cut and shot from the right corner, and Zhu You got the rebound. Kim Yongshik took another forceful shot, which Chihahlov caught without incident.</p>
<p>Visiting Team Takes a One-Goal Lead</p>
<p>At the fourteenth minute, the blonde Robert Stoff dribbled into the penalty area. At a critical moment, Park Daejong slid to clear the ball. Three minutes later, Niejielin committed a handball in the penalty area, and Kim Yongshik took the penalty kick, but missed the opportunity due to eagerness to win. The Soviets counterattacked, with Kapustin receiving a pass from Shawaning and taking a powerful shot from 30 yards out, which Che Chunchong jumped to save. Soon after, the visiting team's forwards used short passes to approach the Soviet goal, and shot powerfully from eight yards out, finding the back of the net, tying the game at one to one. With the score level, the visiting team's central defenders and forwards became more active. In the 32nd minute, Zheng Nanzhi broke through in the middle, going on a solo run. Chihahlov was caught by surprise, and the ball went in, putting the visiting team ahead by two to one. Subsequently, the visiting team's momentum increased, but before long, the first half ended, with the visiting Hansong team leading by two to one.</p>
<p>Visiting Team Launches Fierce Attack in Second Half</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. The Soviet Union kept its original lineup, while the visiting team replaced Wu Jinghuan, who was injured in the eye, with An Zhongxiu. After the restart, the Soviets tried hard to recover, launching a major offensive. However, the visiting team played with increasing courage, with its three central defenders effectively passing the ball back and forth. The Soviet forwards found it difficult to cross the line, and Robert Stoff was tightly marked by Kim Gyuhwan, rendering him ineffective. After eight minutes, the visiting team's forwards became rampant again, with Kim Yongshik and Yu Jinghuan taking repeated shots, which Chihahlov managed to save with difficulty. At this time, the Soviet territory was almost entirely controlled by Hansong, before a prolonged siege was relieved.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Suffers Defeat, Three to One</p>
<p>In the 23rd minute, visiting team member Min Bing committed a handball in the penalty area. Zhang Le awarded a penalty kick, which Tie Fu took, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Less than three minutes later, Sarman followed suit, and Yu Jinghuan scored a goal in return, making it three to one to the visiting team. The Soviet Union, having lost key positions in quick succession, launched a counterattack, but Robert Stoff was unable to turn the tide single-handedly. Hansong waited for the offensive to pass, then attacked again, putting the Soviet defense under intense pressure. This continued until the end of the match, and fortunately for the Soviets, no further goals were conceded. When the allotted time expired, the whistle blew, and the visiting team defeated the Soviet Union by a score of three to one, achieving a successful start to their tour.</p>

Less than four minutes later, Chen Zunchang scored again, making it two to zero. In the second half, Datia University launched a desperate counterattack, and in the 20th minute, they were awarded a penalty kick, which they missed.

<h3>Junior Cup Football Final: Railway Team Wins Championship; Lu Qingxiang's Goal Defeats Qingbai</h3>
<p>The Junior Cup football final was held yesterday morning at 9:30 AM at Yiyuan Stadium between the Railway team and Qingbai B. No tickets were sold, and the stadium was crowded with fans. The result was that the Railway team, with all its forces committed, defeated Qingbai B by a score of one to zero, winning the championship. The match played out as follows:</p>
<p>At 9:30, the whistle blew to start the game. Qingbai B launched the first attack, with Jing Linggui leading the charge into Railway territory. Fortunately, Wu Jiabang, Yue Renxiao, Xu Shengyuan, and others defended effectively, preventing any mishaps. The Railway team, after a period of defense, launched their own attack, with Xiao Ziwen and Wu Binghao advancing together, but with little effect. After a period of chaotic play, the first half ended, with the score at zero to zero.</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. The Railway team launched an all-out counterattack, putting Qingbai B's defense under intense pressure. Zhang Fenggang, Xu Guofu, defended on the left and right, while Huang Shijie supported from front and back, keeping busy. After a chaotic 28 minutes, Lu Qingxiang received a pass from Lin Dianyi and shot powerfully from close range. Huang Shijie was unable to save it, and the ball went into the net, putting the Railway team ahead by one to zero. Qingbai B tried to counterattack, but the Railway team's defense was tight, leaving no openings. When the final whistle blew, the Railway team defeated Qingbai B by a score of one to zero, winning the championship.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Spring Sports Meet to Be Held in Late April</h3>
<p>[Wuxi News] The Wuxi County Secondary School Sports Federation has decided to hold the spring sports meet on the 25th and 26th of this month (or the 28th if it rains). The events are divided into categories such as: high school boys' track, high school boys' field, junior high school boys' track, junior high school boys' field, high school girls' track, and junior high school girls' field.</p>
<h3>Special Feature on Female Athletes: Female Champion Liu Zhenbao</h3>
<p>Among the famous athletes on the Green Team's women's basketball team, which is well-known in Jiangnan, besides Ms. Huang Mingyuan, is Ms. Liu Zhenbao. Ms. Liu is a sharpshooter on the women's basketball team, with almost every shot finding the net. She and Huang Mingyuan can be considered unparalleled, competing with each other, and she is always the highest scorer in every game. Her teammates on the Green Team call her "Female Champion." Very few people inside or outside the circle know this nickname, but "Female Champion" certainly has its origin, dating back eight years.</p>
<p>Events of Eight Years Ago</p>
<p>It was April 2, 1939, when the Youth Association Sports Department organized a men's and women's shooting competition. There were eight heroines participating on the women's side. As a result, Ms. Liu ranked first with 67 points. Therefore, the name Female Champion arose, and her achievement was not obtained in a single day. Below are the results of the top four in the competition at that time:</p>
<p>Name Basket Shot Free Throw Long Shot Dribbling Total Score</p>
<p>Liu Zhenbao 22 24 6 15 67</p>
<p>Li Yunzhi 21 14 15 13 63</p>
<p>Wang Weizhen 18 20 3 18 59</p>
<p>Wang Yinlan 26 14 3 11 54</p>
<p>After reading the above story from the basketball arena, we understood the origin of "Female Champion." Ms. Liu, in this session with the Green Team, switched from defense to forward. In every game, she always gets the most points, originally - her shooting skills were already amazing eight years ago. In addition to Liu Zhenbao, Li Chuozhi, Wang Weizhen, and Wang Yinlan are all Green Team generals. With so many talents, it's no wonder that the Green Team dominates Shanghai.</p>
<p>Has Two Styles</p>
<p>She has the look of a southern girl, and you wouldn't know that she is originally from Guangdong. However, some say she has the gentleness of a southerner. She grew up in the South. In other words, she is a girl with two styles. You see, she has a slightly longer face and round, bright eyes, which is indeed a symbol of a southern girl. As for her personality, it can be said to be completely "quiet" and "gentle." Ordinary people think that athletes should be dynamic and strong, but she is the opposite. Who would have thought that such a gentle and quiet lady would be a general on the basketball court!</p>
<p>Life and Recreation</p>
<p>Of course - everyone knows that she is a top student of Qixiu. She became famous in basketball by representing the Qixiu team. After graduating from Qixiu, she went to Shanghai University. She graduated two years ago, and now she is an English teacher at her alma mater (Qixiu Middle School). In addition to teaching, her after-class recreation is practicing with several teammates from the Green Team and participating in competitions. In addition, she likes to watch movies, and she is also very interested in photography. Ms. Liu's life and recreation can be said to be very proper.</p>
<p>Promoting Successors</p>
<p>The Green Team has a new recruit, Ms. Renbao. Her face and attitude are very similar to Ms. Liu. Everyone originally thought she was her sister. Only after appearing in this session did they know she wasn't. Ms. Xu is very interested in basketball. So, she follows her to watch and practice basketball for three years. Ms. Liu always patiently instructs and teaches her. Ms. Xu is now a member of the Green Team. I think that under the training of the female champion, her future achievements are expected.</p>
<p>Good News is Coming Soon</p>
<p>The author has inquired about her wedding several times, but she always answers "too early." It is reported that Ms. Liu has found a satisfactory partner, and the wedding is not far away. Most female basketball players retire and stay at home after getting married. Of course, the Green Team will suffer a serious loss. At the same time, fans will not be able to see the "Female Champion's" shooting skills. However - she is promoting Ms. Xu, and the next generation will rise. This is exactly her painstaking effort!

<h3>Four Banks Joint Office Stipulates That Various Banks and Bureaus Assist in the Purchase and Supply of Goods</h3>
<p>Previously, in order to suppress prices, the authorities ordered the financial sector to assist in handling. The Four Banks Joint Office immediately stipulated that various banks and bureaus should release educational business to cooperate with the method of supplying daily necessities for people's livelihoods, assist in promoting the plan, and use the existing branches of various banks and bureaus to assist in purchasing and supplying goods, so as to help facilitate transportation and dredge the source of goods. This method has been approved by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Office. The method is recorded below: (1) When the supplying agency orders products from various producing areas and various production enterprises, it may contact the automobile and transportation banks and bureaus to provide priority loans in the form of export financing. (2) When the supplying agency needs funds to turn over for the self-ordered and allocated goods, it may contact the professional banks and bureaus to provide priority loans in the form of export financing. (3) When each bank and bureau handles this export financing, it should try to facilitate it as much as possible and pay attention to the following points: (A) The export financing period should be determined based on the length of the transportation route. (B) The export financing discount should be appropriately relaxed. (C) Various freight vouchers and required documents should be simplified as much as possible to avoid complexity. (D) Within the possible scope, handle cargo insurance and other necessary procedures on behalf of the client. (4) Public and private transportation enterprises that borrow from various banks should earnestly cooperate and assist in the purchase, sale, and transportation of supplied goods, and handle it in accordance with the following points: (A) Allocate a certain amount of transportation capacity to transport supplied goods. (B) Transport supplied goods at the lowest possible freight rate. (C) Transport supplied goods on the earliest possible date.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Discusses Import Quota for Paper</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Recently, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has repeatedly convened various paper mills to discuss the supply of papermaking raw materials in this city. Regarding the issue of allocating import quotas for paper, the member factories of the paper industry stated that the foreign exchange quota for February to April for paper is $3,460,000. Among them, cigarette paper is 800,000 US dollars, newspaper is 2 million US dollars, wood pulp is 350,000 US dollars, and miscellaneous items are 300,000 US dollars. It is said that this distribution method is based on the statistics of the Republic of China years 25-26 and last year. However, the situation of the domestic paper industry ten years ago is completely different from today. Moreover, due to the dumping of foreign goods last year (about 100,000 tons of imported paper), most factories stopped work. In addition, the sale of enemy and puppet pulp resulted in a very small amount of pulp imports. It is not very reasonable to use this as a basis. After consultation between the parties, the following methods are considered to have value for consideration:</p>
<p>(1) The next import quota should be relaxed for foreign exchange settlement for paper.</p>
<p>(2) If the foreign exchange settlement quota cannot be relaxed, the following items can be adopted as appropriate:</p>
<p>(B) The inventory of cigarette paper in this city can be used for several months, and the import volume can be temporarily reduced. Because Minfeng Paper Mill can now produce 30,000 rolls per year, which is only one-quarter of the consumption. Production can be doubled in July. After that, the import of cigarette paper can be limited to 2,000 tons per year.</p>
<p>(A) The import of newspaper can be changed to wood pulp. Because one ton of wood pulp can make two tons of newspaper. Therefore, with the same amount of foreign exchange, two times the amount of newspaper can be manufactured in the country, which is beneficial to the cultural industry and can save foreign exchange. Two million US dollars can order about 10,000 tons of pulp. About 3,000 tons can be obtained per month. The raw materials of various paper mills will be supplemented to some extent. And the work of the various paper mills will not fall into a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>(C) Most of the miscellaneous paper can be manufactured by itself, and should be strictly restricted to be used for pulp imports.</p>
<p>In addition, blankets and copper wire mesh, which are necessary for papermaking, must also rely on imported goods. Although blankets are manufactured in this country, their durability is only one-third of that of foreign goods. Copper wire mesh must be imported by any means.</p>
<h3>China Cooperative Determines Grades of Branches</h3>
<p>The Central Cooperative Treasury has seven branches and nine sub-branches distributed throughout the country. Recently, in order to facilitate management, the treasury has temporarily determined three grades for the branches. The first-grade branches include the four branches in Shanghai, Northeast, Hebei, and Hubei. There are no second-grade branches for the time being. The third-grade branches include the three branches in Henan, Beiping, and Shandong. There is only one first-grade sub-branch, the Qingdao sub-branch. There are no second-grade sub-branches for the time being. The third-grade sub-branches include the eight sub-branches in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Bengbu, Taixian, Jinzhou, Liaoyang, Andong, and Fancheng. In addition, the treasury plans to set up a third-grade sub-branch in Wuxi and Wuhu. It can be established in the short term. In the larger local areas of Yangzhou, Dongtai, Tunxi, etc., a branch office will be set up in each province to promote cooperative undertakings in various places.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Seafood, Dried Longan, and Northern Goods Industries and Southern Goods Industry</h3>
<p>The seafood, northern goods, and dried longan industries in this city suddenly refused to allow the southern goods industry to purchase goods from the 12th of this month, and sent inspectors to refuse the southern goods industry to contact transactions on the second and third floors of the Xiaodongmen market and inspect freight cars. This caused a great disturbance. The Shanghai City Sugar, Seafood, Northern Goods, Southern Sundries Industry Joint Market on Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, was originally a gathering place for the Shanghai sugar, seafood, northern goods, southern goods, and other industries to buy and sell goods. Because the southern goods industry purchased goods from the previous three industries, it usually paid ten-day checks called Suoqi (ie, intermediary fees), which were also decided by the four industries to implement for a long time. Now, the previous three industries suddenly decided to notify the southern goods industry that all transactions would be settled in cash. However, the southern goods industry believes that using cash will not only exploit profits, but also have a great impact on established prices. It is reported that the southern goods industry has decided to stop business after selling out the inventory in each store, and asked the competent authorities for relief.</p>
<h3>Japanese Expansion of Production Endangers Our Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 13th Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Our textile industry is facing a new crisis, and the economic authorities are planning to provide relief. According to an economic authority who told reporters, the Japanese textile industry currently has 3 million spindles, which is several times more than our current 1.4 million spindles. Recently, Japan has also loudly called the textile industry its lifeline, and the Allied Headquarters also intends to increase its number of spindles from 3 million to 6 million. If this is realized, it will be a major blow to our fragile textile industry. The story of Japanese cotton monopolizing the East Asian market after the First World War is bound to repeat itself. The authorities are paying close attention to this and have recently held meetings to discuss possible negotiations with the Allied Headquarters to find ways to prevent it. Another possible step is to increase the import tax rate on textiles. Encouraging the production of domestic cotton has been given great attention in the past, and will be given even more importance in the future.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices of Paper Fans</h3>
<p>The paper fans used in summer are mostly produced in Guangdong. This year, due to rare production and strong sales, prices have soared. According to a Cantonese businessman, the price of paper fans this year has increased significantly compared to last year. This is because the production area of Xinhui only produced one-third of last year's output, while sales are more prosperous than in recent years. At the same time, it was also learned that before the victory, the enemy and puppets had prohibited people from planting sunflowers. If they want to restore the pre-war output, it will take at least five years.</p>
<h3>Increased Demand and Rising Prices for Tobacco Leaves</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the prices of Qingzhou, Xuzhou, Fengyang, Tongcheng, Xinchang, Sidu, Tongxiang, Susong, and other tobacco leaves in the city have already increased. According to people in the industry, tobacco leaves are better sold to tobacco factories, and the demand is stronger. In addition, water fees, transportation fees, and tax payments are frequently increasing, and the upward trend is just beginning.</p>
<p>Increased Cost of Xiangxu Tobacco Leaves</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Recently, the price of Xuzhou tobacco leaves has been increasing step by step. The reason is said to be that the local price in Xuchang has increased, so Shanghai has also increased accordingly. According to people who are familiar with the content and have research experience, Xiangxu tobacco leaves originally had a lot of adulteration. Recently, the local county government's goods tax bureau, tobacco industry association, and tobacco production improvement office and other agencies have jointly cracked down on it. The tobacco industry is taking the procurement of goods seriously, so the tobacco leaves in that place are pure and no longer adulterated, and they can be stored for a long time without damage. Even after the yellow and moldy season, they will not deteriorate. However, because the selection is strict and the cost is increased, the price should be increased accordingly. However, the Xuye tobacco in Shanghai is all transported before the adjustment, and there are adulterated goods in it, and it contains a lot of moisture. In the summer, there is a danger of mold and discoloration, so manufacturers are wary and dare not import too much. Although the asking price is very high, there are very few transactions.</p>
<h3>Alumni of East Asia Physical Education School Welcome Chairman Li</h3>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education School and its affiliated middle school specially convened a gathering of graduates and alumni in Shanghai yesterday at the Municipal Gezhi Middle School to welcome the new director Li Zihou. The new director Li Zihou, the principal Chen Mengyu, and teachers Jiang Huyu, Shao Rugan, and Pan Boying, and more than 10 other people and alumni Wu Zibin, Yang Jingwan. More than 100 people, such as Zhang Juefei, reported by Principal Chen and introduced Director Li, and Jiang Xiangqing Shao Rugan and the principal of the attached middle school Hou Jiyuan and others gave training, with many encouragements, the school's alumni, with the foundation of the reconstruction of the school has been laid, excited.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Sports Branch Sets Up National Training Class</h3>
<p>The Municipal Sports Field Nanshi Branch, in order to promote national martial arts and popularize self-defense activities, has specially set up a national martial arts training class, divided into four classes: beginner, intermediate, advanced, and special. Including various boxing and martial arts, taught by Liu Desheng, each class is trained for a period of one year, and those who pass the examination will be given a certificate of completion of training.

<h3>Xichun Season Games Will Be Held This Month</h3>
<p>[Wuxi News] The Xixian Secondary School Sports Federation has recently decided to hold the Spring Games on the 25th and 26th of this month (if it rains, it will be changed to the 28th), divided into men's high, men's high, men's elementary, men's elementary, women's high, and women's junior high.</p>
<h3>Special Features on Female Athletes: Woman's Champion Liu Zhenbao</h3>
<p>In the Green Team women's basketball team, which is famous in Jiangnan, the famous players are, in addition to Miss Huang Mingyuan, Miss Liu Zhenbao. Miss Liu is a basketball player in the women's basketball team who is a shooter, and she must hit the shot, and she and Huang Mingyuan can be called two difficult, competing with each other, and she is always the highest scorer in each game. Among the Green Team, the companions call her "The Female Champion," this nickname is known to very few people inside and outside the circle, but the road to "The Female Champion" does have its origins. Tracing back to the past, it was still eight years ago.</p>
<p>Events Eight Years Ago</p>
<p>It was April 2, 1939, when the Youth Association's sports department organized a men's and women's shooting competition. On the women's side, there were eight heroines who participated. As a result, Miss Liu ranked first with 67 points. So the name of The Female Champion was created, which shows that her achievements were not obtained in one day.

<p>Li Yunzhi 21 14 15 13 63</p>
<p>Wang Weizhen 18 20 3 18 59</p>
<p>Wang Yinlan 26 14 3 11 54</p>
<p>After reading the above section of the basketball game, we understood the origin of "The Female Champion." This term, Ms. Liu, in the Green Team, changed from defender to forward. She always gets the most points in every game. Originally - her shooting skills had already been amazing eight years ago. In addition to Liu Zhenbao, Li Chuozhi, Wang Weizhen, and Wang Yinlan are all great generals of the Green Team, and there are so many talents that it is no wonder that the Green Team is dominant in Shanghai, and no one can surpass it.</p>
<p>There are Two Kinds of Grace</p>
<p>How much is she taking on a girl's posture in the South Country, if you don't say it, you won't know that she is originally from Guangdong, but some people say that she has the gentleness of a southerner, she was raised in the South since she was a child, in other words, she is a girl with two kinds of grace. Look, she has a slightly long face and round and vivid black eyes, which is indeed a symbol of a southern girl. As for her personality, it can be said to be completely "quiet" and "gentle." Ordinary people think that athletes should be moving, just, but she is just the opposite. Who would have thought that such a gentle and quiet lady would be a female general who gallops on the court!</p>
<p>Life and Recreation</p>
<p>Of course - everyone knows that she is a talented student of Qixiu, because she became famous in basketball by representing the Qixiu team in Shanghai that year, and after graduating from Qixiu, she entered Shanghai University, so two years ago, she wore a square hat, and now she is in her alma mater (Qixiu Middle School) and is an English teacher. In addition to teaching, her after-class recreation is practicing with several teammates from the Green Team and participating in competitions. In addition, she likes to watch movies, and she is also very interested in photography. Ms. Liu's life and recreation can be said to be very upright.</p>
<p>On the promotion of later generations</p>
<p>There is a new Jin Renbao Miss on the Green Team, her face and attitude are very similar to her, and everyone originally thought she was her sister. Only after her appearance in this session did she know that she was not. Miss Xu is very determined to play basketball, so she has been following her to watch the game and practice the ball for three years as a day. Miss Liu has also always patiently instructed her and taught her. Miss Xu is now a member of the Green Team. I think that under the training of the female champion, the achievements of the alien day are expected.</p>
<p>Happy Events are Coming Soon</p>
<p>I have asked her about her happy events several times, but she always answers "too early." It is reported that Miss Liu has found a satisfactory object, and the joy is not far away. Most female basketball players retire and live at home after getting married. Of course, the Green Team will suffer serious losses. At the same time, fans will not be able to see the "Female Champion" 's shooting skills, but - she is promoting Miss Xu, and later generations have someone, which is exactly her hard work!

<h3>Domestically Produced Knitwear: Slightly Better Sales in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A leading figure in the city's knitwear industry told our reporter yesterday that the export situation for domestically produced knitwear has become more active since the foreign exchange rate adjustment, with Southeast Asia being the main destination. According to estimates, the monthly export volume to Southeast Asia in the past two months has been approximately 100,000 dozens of socks and 60,000 dozens of underwear. There is still a slight profit to be made from shipments to Hong Kong and the Philippines. Shipments to Singapore, Siam, and other places yield no profit at all. Currently, merchants are exploring shipments, hoping to restore the pre-war market for domestically produced knitwear in Southeast Asia. According to statistics, the current export volume to Southeast Asia is less than 20% of the peak season before the war. It is urgently hoped that relevant departments will provide practical assistance and promotion to the export of this industry. As for the previous joint effort by the industry with several cotton yarn re-weaving trade associations to form a joint venture company for the export of cotton yarn re-woven products, it is still in the planning stage. It is said that the purpose of the company is nothing more than to use the collective strength of the industry to exchange finished products for cotton yarn and cotton thread from state-owned yarn factories, which is a manufacturing agency. The finished products are then exported by the company in a planned manner. However, due to the importance of this matter and the wide range of involvement, it is still actively soliciting opinions from all parties concerned. Once the time is right, it will be planned to establish it.</p>
<h3>Nylon Tires</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] Goodyear Rubber Tire Company has recently manufactured a tire made entirely of nylon thread. It is said that the strength of this tire is 60% greater than any other tire. In addition, the tire casing is made of six-ply nylon, making the tire lighter and stronger. However, due to the current shortage of nylon, the company is temporarily only manufacturing pure nylon tires for large vehicles.</p>
<h3>China Silk Company Convenes Symposium</h3>
<p>Research on Loan and Cocoon Purchasing Issues</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The annual silk production and sales plan drafted by the China Silk Company has not yet been approved after being submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and then to the Executive Yuan for review. However, the cocoon collection time in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is approaching, with only 45 days remaining in Jiangsu and only one month in Zhejiang. In order to gain time and prepare in advance, the company specially convened a symposium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, bringing together representatives from the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Those attending included Ge Jingzhong and Tang Xixiang from the China Silk Company, Zhou Yuangong representing the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Jiang Shiqi representing the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, Wang Huanan, and Shen Jiuru from the Third District Silk Trade Association, Tao Juru from the China Farmers Bank, and others. The discussion ended around 12:00 noon. It was decided to form another small group meeting, which will be held continuously for ten days starting next week, to jointly study preparatory work such as spring silkworm loans, cocoon collection, and opening cocoon houses, in order to promote this year's production and sales plan.</p>
<h3>Machine Casting and Other Industries Negotiate Purchase of North China Steel</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Bureau of Industry and Commerce previously negotiated on behalf of the city's machine, casting, and electrical equipment industries for the purchase of iron and steel from North China. It has now been confirmed that the Shanghai Operations Office of the Iron and Steel Enterprise Management Committee of the Executive Yuan will handle the matter. It is now known that the required quantities for each industry and the dates of shipment have been determined. The three industries need a total of 2,643 tons of No. 1 pig iron and 277 tons of No. 2 pig iron, totaling 2,920 tons. The delivery dates are as follows: the first batch of 1,000 tons will be shipped from Qinhuangdao before April 15th; the second batch of 1,000 tons will be shipped from the same location before April 30th; and the third batch of 920 tons will be shipped from the same location before May 15th. The price is only 1.23 million yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Investigates Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou correspondent] In view of the recent price fluctuations, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to establish a provincial economic reporting office to strengthen control. It has urgently telegraphed the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, ordering them to report the price increases and decreases of daily necessities such as rice, oil, flour, firewood, and yarn every Wednesday and Saturday. Any drastic changes must be reported immediately for instructions.</p>
<h3>Review of the Spring Woolen Fabric Market: Prices Have Been Rising Steadily for Three Months</h3>
<p>In mid-January of the 35th year of the Republic, the woolen fabric market was mediocre, and transactions were even more sluggish. Except for fancy woolen fabrics, which were trending stronger and prospects looked good, there were no other ups and downs. The price of overcoat fabrics fell particularly sharply because the peak selling season had passed. The 27th was the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, and the market opened on a positive note, with an average increase of 1.5%. In general, merchants were aware of the government's strict control over imports, the difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange, and the constant increase in factory prices. With the issuance of the 250 and 500 gold bond notes and widespread rumors of foreign exchange adjustments, the prices of daily necessities soared one after another. Although new woolen fabric transactions were less than in previous years, the outlook was quite promising.</p>
<p>Overall, woolen fabric businesses in the 35th year of the Republic made the most profit, followed by those in Qipan Street, while those in Zihua Street, except for Xie Da, made a considerable profit, and the rest were lucky to avoid losses. The profits from wholesale were only on paper, as most of the profits were consumed by high-interest loans. On the 28th, Chun He Yong was robbed of fancy woolen fabrics, with an estimated loss of 12 million yuan, which also reflects the situation at the time.</p>
<p>In early March, the prices of all woolen fabrics increased across the board. With rumors of favorable buying opportunities prevalent, factories hoarded goods to drive up prices. On the 5th, after the 50% increase in tariffs, the market became even more expensive. At the same time, gold and US dollars were rising, and prices were rising across the board, so woolen fabrics were no exception. On the 17th, the US exchange rate was adjusted from 3,350 to 12,000 yuan, which had a significant direct impact on woolen fabrics. As a result, retail and wholesale prices increased further. Although the government stipulated that 4.8 million gold yuan be collected by the national bank and made every effort to stabilize prices, prices on the market were still rising overtly and covertly. On the 22nd, after the temporary ban on the import of woolen fabrics was announced, panic arose again in the industry. Most import merchants were forced to halt their business. All manufacturers of woolen fabrics took the opportunity to rise, like the darlings of heaven, and prices soared. Woolen fabric stores followed the lead of the manufacturers, and retail prices rose step by step due to the difficulty of importing goods and the hoarding of goods to drive up prices.</p>
<p>Looking back at the actual sales at that time, there was little activity from local and foreign customers due to the cold weather. Except for Melton, there were few large transactions. In addition, due to the fear of high-interest loans, people dared not try again. Moreover, prices were rising too fast, and the colors were incomplete, which increased costs and made it difficult to turn over inventory. Among buyers, under the high pressure of the current cost of living, there were only a few who could afford to have a suit made for tens of thousands of yuan or a robe for four or five hundred thousand yuan. Therefore, the current trend in the woolen fabric industry is nothing more than a shortage of goods, high prices, and difficult buying and selling.</p>
<p>In the middle of last month, following the momentum of the previous month, prices continued to rise from beginning to end. Due to the fact that raincoats were in season and the increase in finishing fees and yarn prices, the price per yard increased from 12,000-13,000 yuan to 17,000-18,000 yuan. Summer goods were priced surprisingly high, with English-made valeting being quoted at 235,000 yuan per yard, domestic fabrics at 150,000-160,000 yuan, and Zhanghua palings selling for 140,000 yuan. However, actual transactions were few, because local and foreign buyers not only thought the prices were too high, but also because the actual sales season was still some time away. However, the prices of fancy woolen fabrics and Xuanwei fabrics have increased significantly. Light-colored woolen fabrics were in short supply and selling well, with strong demand from local stores and Nanjing stores. For the same quality of goods, the selling price often differed by 3,000-5,000 yuan per yard due to the difference in color. The standard prices for spring woolen fabrics from January 15 to March 15 are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Chen Yi's Death: Dynamics of the Shandong Communists After the Central Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Was Cleared</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Jinan, 5th Day of the Month via Airmail. Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Fu Tian</p>
<p>Despite the Chinese Communists' repeated claims that the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the area west of it were voluntarily abandoned as a strategic move by the Communist forces, the fact remains that the Xuzhou-Jinan section was cleared, and the two Nationalist armies led by Wang Yaowu and Wang Jingjiu joined forces. With the clearing of the Xuzhou-Jinan section, the entire situation in Shandong has entered a new stage. The next target of the Nationalist army is naturally to annihilate the main force of the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountain area, along with the necessary action of reopening the Jiaoji Railway (at least the Jinan-Zhangdian Zibo section).</p>
<p>Deployment and Intentions of the Shandong Communists</p>
<p>As military strategists say, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." It is worth noting that since the Luzhong Campaign in late February, Chen Yi has been running an officer training camp in Zichuan, calling up Communist division commanders and platoon leaders in stages for ten days of training per period. Over the past month or so, all cadres have completed the training. At the same time, the losses suffered in the battles of Lunan, Luzhong, and Luxi have been replenished. As of now, the dynamics of the Shandong Communists can be explained in three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Outer Perimeter of Jinan: Including the area west of Zhangdian, north of Mengyin Dawenkou, south of Yucheng, and west of the Jinpu Railway. It is estimated that a total of fourteen Communist divisions and three brigades, totaling approximately 200,000 men, are stationed there (local troops and militia are not included). Their deployment is as follows: The New First Division is stationed east of Zhangdian; the Second and Fourth Divisions are stationed between Zhangdian and Zhoucun; the 7th column is stationed between Mingshui and Guodian; the 11th column is stationed in Zhangqiu; the 6th Division is stationed in Zichuan; the 3rd column is stationed in Laiwu; the 4th and 9th Divisions and the 1st guard brigade are stationed in the Fanjiazhen area east of Taian; the 8th division is stationed near Xintai; the 2nd guard brigade is stationed in and north of Mount Tai; part of the 1st division is stationed in Mount Culai, and part is stationed north of Feixian; the 7th division, the New 7th division and New 11th division are stationed in Mengyin. North of the Yellow River, in addition to local teams, only the 6th Guard Brigade is currently stationed near Yucheng. The main force of Liu Bocheng's troops, originally stationed between Qihe, Xishou, and Zhangjian, secretly moved west to northern Henan on March 23, launching an offensive against the Daoqing Railway in an attempt to traverse northern Henan and enter southern Shanxi to join forces with the troops of Peng Dehuai and He Long, who had retreated from northern Shaanxi to western Shanxi, to attack Shanxi. After repeated setbacks in attacking Jipu, the Communist forces in the above-mentioned areas changed their strategy, concentrating their main forces in the Laiwu, Xintai, Fanjiazhen, and Yangliudian areas. Their possible actions include:</p>
<p>1. Advancing and retreating between Mount Tai and Mount Culai, cutting off traffic on the Xuzhou-Jinan section and severing the connection between the Nationalist army's north and south corps.</p>
<p>2. Launching another attack on southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, attacking the rear of the Nationalist army.</p>
<p>3. Maintaining maneuverability, attacking the flank of the Nationalist army advancing north from Linyi.</p>
<p>(2) Changwei Area: The Communist forces on the outskirts of Changle, Weixian, and Anqiu have also suffered repeated setbacks, and now only the 5th Guard Brigade and militia remain, which are not a major concern. According to reports obtained on the 2nd and 4th of this month, their main force of approximately 30,000 has been transferred to the southeast of Yishui, apparently intending to attack the flank of Linyi and then launch another attack on northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>(3) Outer Perimeter of Qingdao: In addition to the original 5th and 6th columns, the 3rd and 4th guard brigades, and the Binhai Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, the Binbei Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments, the Jiaonan Column, and the militia, more than 20,000 men have recently been transferred from Yantai. At the same time, the highway from Yantai to Jimo north to Lingshan has been repaired, and the coastal highway from Yantai east to Weihaiwei and west to Changyi has also been repaired and extended to Yangjiaogou at the mouth of the Xiaoqing River. Their intentions are to prevent the Nationalist army's navy from landing to facilitate the deployment of troops and to create a threatening posture towards Qingdao. However, the Nationalist army's troop strength on the island is not weak, but passive defense is still more than sufficient.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Battle Order</p>
<p>Following the "Chinese Communist Revolutionary Military Commission" renaming the Eighth Route Army as the "Chinese People's Liberation Army," the New Fourth Army and other forces in Shandong originally under the command of Chen Yi were also renamed the "East China People's Liberation Army" or "East China Field Army" from March, with Chen Yi still serving as commander and Su Yu and Zhang Dingcheng serving as deputy commanders. Zhang Aiping, the former commander of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, was transferred to the position of chief of staff. In addition to the original political commissar Rao Jishi continuing to serve, Tan Zhenlin, the commander of the Sixth Division of the New Fourth Army, was also transferred to serve as political commissar. Deng Ziming and Zhong Qiguang were appointed as the directors of the political department. The original designations of the various divisions of the New Fourth Army and the various liberation divisions, new divisions, guard brigades, etc., were all abolished and replaced by ten columns, with each column comprising three divisions, each division comprising three regiments, and one special service regiment, one training regiment, and one artillery regiment. Each column had approximately 30,000 to 35,000 men. The total strength, excluding the militia, is currently approximately 350,000 men due to the westward transfer of Liu Bocheng's main force (losses from various battles have been fully replenished).</p>
<p>The Abandonment Theory is Just a Smokescreen</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th of last (March), a Nationalist army unit discovered two jeeps, one sedan, and two medium-sized Japanese trucks near Shangzhuang, south of Zhoucun Railway Station. These vehicles were traveling from east to west, apparently carrying the leaders of the Shandong Communists. An ambush attack was launched. Afterwards, news came that Chen Yi was in the car. A bullet entered from Chen's shoulder and exited from his flank, and he died of his injuries on the 17th, or the 19th, according to another account. The headquarters of the East China Field Army in Dakandi, Zichuan, and the pseudo-provincial government in Shantouzhuang, Boshan, both held grand memorial services. However, the confession of a prisoner captured by the Baoding Pacification Office stated that he had seen the Jian Guo Daily published in northern Shaanxi with the number 1853, which contained an article by Zhu De mourning Chen Yi. What is doubtful is that the prisoner was able to remember the publication number of the newspaper when he read it. Recently, someone who escaped from Luzhong to Jinan said that Chen Yi had recently attended a certain fruit meeting and given a speech. Therefore, some observers believe that this is a deliberate attempt by the Communist army to spread misinformation and pass off the false as true. This is similar to the Communist army's recent deliberate fabrication of slogans such as "Abandoning the interior and recovering the exterior," and "Abandoning Shandong, but not abandoning the youth of Shandong" in order to weaken the morale of the Nationalist army. This deserves the high vigilance of the Nationalist army. Evidence of this is that although the Shandong Communists have transported much of the materials they plundered in Luzhong to the Bohai Military Region north of the Yellow River, their troops are not only not being transferred north, but are being transferred south and concentrated in the Xintai, Mengyin, and Yishui areas, repairing the coastal highways, the highway between Yantai and Jimo, and the highway between Yidu and Yishui to facilitate their supply and movement. It can be seen that their intentions are not small, and there is no sign of abandoning Shandong. The so-called abandonment is really just a smokescreen, because strategically, only by ensuring Shandong can the Communist army launch another attack on southern Shandong and return to northern Jiangsu at any time.</p>
<p>The Last Days of the Southern China Despot</p>
<p>(Above) Tanaka Ichi, a Japanese war criminal who once roamed southern China, paraded through the streets before his execution. (Below) Tanaka knelt down with his teeth clenched and a ferocious look on his face, waiting for the moment when death would descend. (Photo by Li Jingkai)</p>
<h3>Take a Look at the Fate of the Number One War Criminal in Southern China: Tanaka Hisaichi Executed</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Dispatch, April 2. Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Liang Feng</p>
<p>March 27 was the most gratifying day for the people of Guangzhou, especially for the people of Guangzhou during the occupation. Their hatred, which had been suppressed in their hearts for many years, disappeared today! Because Tanaka Hisaichi, a lieutenant general of the army and commander of the Southern China Expeditionary Army and Governor of Hong Kong, who had dominated Southern China for more than two years, was publicly executed on the afternoon of that day!</p>
<p>At about 3:20, Cai Lijin, the military prosecutor of the military court of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, accompanied by clerk and translator Zeng Guangke, took the stand and brought Tanaka up. At that time, Tanaka was wearing a very neat military uniform, wearing a military cap, wearing nearsighted glasses, and holding a yellow leather bag with a zipper in his hand. The yellow leather shoes on his feet were polished brightly. As soon as he entered the court door, he took off his military cap and bowed to the judge. After the judge read out the charges against him, he asked him if he had any last words. He only requested that his belongings be sent back to his family in Japan. Other than that, he had nothing else to say. On the surface, he knew that the death penalty was about to be carried out, but he was still very calm. Although his pale face revealed some melancholy emotions, he still could not see the trembling of his knees. Probably, he also knew that his sins were full and that he would eventually have this day!</p>
<p>After verifying his identity, translator Zeng Guangke found him some Japanese utensils and gave him a glass of Japanese wine and a Japanese cigarette. This was his last enjoyment.</p>
<p>After all the formalities were completed, the 26th Regiment of the Gendarmerie took over the task and escorted him onto a large truck to parade through the streets under the white cloth banner that read "Execution of Japanese War Criminal Tanaka Hisaichi, Commander-in-Chief of Southern China." Wherever the truck passed, thousands of people flocked to see the face of this monster. The people along the way all celebrated with their hands raised. They whispered about the tragic past when our compatriots were poisoned by him during the occupation, grinding their teeth as if this deep hatred had not yet been extinguished!</p>
<p>The place of execution was the Liuhua Bridge execution ground in the suburbs of the city. Under the escort of two gendarmes, Tanaka walked more than ten steps facing west. At this time, he was no longer allowed to be calm. Probably, at the moment between life and death, it is inevitable that there will be some fear. At that time, he clenched his teeth tightly, fully revealing his original ferocious face. At 4:16, the supervising officer gave an order, and Tanaka Hisaichi knelt down on both knees. The shooter aimed his rifle at Tanaka's back heart and fired with a bang. Tanaka fell forward, and the shooter fired three more shots. Only his yellow velvet military uniform was stained red with blood. This war-mongering generation of heroes ended here. This is the end of those who play with weapons!</p>

<p>A Humble Proposal for Improving Fire Protection in the Southern City</p>
<p>Editor: In this fire in the Southern City, most of the victims were poor shantytown residents, because the building materials were all easily flammable materials, and they were densely built in one area, so once a fire broke out, it was uncontrollable. Moreover, the Taiping dragon heads in the Southern City are mostly damaged, so even if there are fire trucks, they are useless. After this big fire, we could have learned from the past and prevented future occurrences, and found ways to improve, but instead, the shantytowns are still being built in the same place. Therefore, formal residents are all in constant danger, fearing that once a fire breaks out, they will repeat the same mistakes. We sincerely hope that the authorities will take preemptive measures and persuade the shantytowns to move to the suburbs, such as the area near the South Railway Station, where there is vacant land. On the one hand, we should add water pipes and improve fire-fighting equipment. This matter concerns public safety and the appearance of the city. Please publish it in your newspaper to urge the municipal authorities to adopt it. (A resident of the Southern City)</p>
<p>Please Suppress the Soaring Price of Cotton as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Editor: Last month, prices soared unprecedentedly. Fortunately, the government implemented emergency economic measures to suppress the prices of various goods. However, it was not long before the price of cotton soared. According to the price of rough cotton at the beginning of February (per dan), it was only 180,000 yuan, but during the gold tide period, it once reached 440,000 yuan. Later, due to the implementation of the economic emergency measures plan, it was suppressed to 350,000 yuan. However, in the blink of an eye, it has reappeared at a new peak of 530,000 yuan. Cotton is an agricultural product, and a high price can indeed increase farmers' income, but since the price of cotton is high, the cost of yarn and cloth has increased sharply, and yarn and cloth are essential daily necessities, so the impact on people's livelihood goes without saying. Moreover, compared with other major commodities - such as rice - it has obviously lost its balance (the price of white rice at the beginning of February was 80,000 yuan, and now it is only 110,000 yuan). If this abnormal state is allowed to continue without finding a way to eliminate it, it will inevitably affect other prices in the future and should be stopped as soon as possible. (Jiang Xiaoluan, Tangjia Gate) March 5.</p>
<p>Public Training Survivors Call for Relief</p>
<p>I previously saw in various newspapers that the supplies issued by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration first went to Shanghai. I recall that the most pitiful are the survivors of the Shanghai citizens who received public training and died in the Anti-Japanese War. They have not yet received benefits. The martyrs sacrificed for national survival and territorial integrity. They received public training and were organized into the guards to participate in the August 13 Incident, the Battle of Songhu, and fought side by side with the local garrison. Some were responsible for spying on enemy information, maintaining transportation, detecting enemy spies, rescuing air raid refugees and wounded soldiers, and building defensive works. Later, when the Japanese invaders landed in Jinshanwei, they covered the Nationalist army's westward retreat, and then retreated from Shanghai with the army. They were ordered to be sent to Qingpu Songjiang and then given special training and reorganized into the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Special Operations Detachment to serve as the foundation for the Anti-Japanese War. Later, they were attacked by the enemy with the latest weapons, and most of the public training members made heroic sacrifices. Their achievements can be imagined. Although they were not praised by the National Government authorities, they became a brilliant and glorious page in Chinese history. Today, a group of orphans and widows are left behind, suffering from hunger and cold. Now that the country has been victorious for more than a year, we are still suffering from this unspeakable life. I hope that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the social authorities will quickly investigate and provide relief to this group of anti-Japanese survivors as much as possible to comfort the loyal souls and announce to the future. (Zhou Hanze, representative of the survivors of public training team martyrs)</p>
<p>The Old West Gate Should be Rectified in Two Matters</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>The inscription on the Chen Xianlie Memorial Tower at the Old West Gate, carved in marble, describes the revolutionary achievements of Mr. Chen Xianlie. But now, the marble is covered with stains, and the gold characters cannot be identified. Furthermore, there is a neon light frame made by the former Mayor Wu Tiecheng to the east of the tower, with ten large characters "Implement New Life and Eliminate Bad Habits." According to newspapers, outdoor neon lights in stores will be restored starting on April 1. Then, these ten characters should be seen in the light again, complementing the four characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" on the 24th floor of the International Hotel. The above two matters are all related to the appearance of the city and the transformation of customs. Please pay attention to them, municipal authorities. (Tao Dejun)</p>

<h3>Review of Japan's Reparations Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhao Nanrou</p>
<p>Reparations from defeated nations to victorious nations have been a common practice since the dawn of warfare, especially when an aggressor nation is defeated and must pay reparations to the nation it invaded – this is even more reasonable and natural. However, regarding the principle of reparations, there's a distinction between punitive reparations and damage reparations, and the latter is further divided into full reparations and incomplete reparations. As for the methods of reparations, there's a distinction between monetary reparations and reparations in kind. Concerning reparations from Japan after its defeat, the principles and methods adopted by the United Nations can first be found in the Potsdam Declaration. The Declaration stated: "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war." Based on this spirit, the United States, in its initial post-surrender policy toward Japan published in September 1945, stated: "All facilities for manufacturing and processing goods and materials exceeding peaceful domestic requirements and which are not necessary to the maintenance of Japan’s peaceful economy, shall be removed." It further stated: "No reparations shall be exacted which conflict with the program for the demilitarization of Japan or which are liable to hinder its execution." Based on the same spirit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang stated in London in September 1945: "China hopes to first confiscate Japanese factories in Japan and Northeast China, and obtain reparations from them." Subsequently, while staying in Paris in September of the following year, he also stated: "Although China suffered great losses during the war, it will not make reparations demands exceeding Japan's ability to pay. China will not adopt a policy of revenge when drafting the peace treaty." It is clear that neither the Potsdam Declaration, nor the policies of the United States or China, adopted punitive principles, but rather adopted an incomplete reparations principle. This is because adopting a punitive principle exceeding Japan's ability to pay would only lead to resentment from the Japanese people, and adopting full damage reparations would also be beyond Japan's ability to pay. At the same time, the method of reparations in kind was adopted instead of monetary reparations. This is because monetary reparations lack certainty, as evidenced by Germany's reparations after World War I. Furthermore, monetary reparations cannot restrict the industrial production of the nation paying reparations, which could still lead to rearmament. Conversely, reparations in kind not only have certainty but can also restrict rearmament based on industrial strength. Although the fundamental policies of China and the United States regarding Japan's reparations problem were both based on the Potsdam Declaration, the focus of the two countries in dealing with this problem was not entirely the same. The United States focused on eliminating Japan's industrial base for rearmament and did not emphasize Japan's reparations for its damages to the U.S. President Truman's reparations commissioner, Pauley, stated in Tokyo: "Our purpose is to demilitarize Japan and create a democratic Japan. If this purpose of occupation can be achieved, it does not matter even if we do not get reparations." This is because the reparations that Japan could give to the United States were insignificant in the eyes of the United States. As Pauley said in Los Angeles in December 1945: "The United States' war expenses against Japan amounted to 100 billion U.S. dollars, but Japan's reparations to the United States would probably not exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars, which is just 'a drop in the bucket.'" Of course, the United States insisted on "removing all facilities for manufacturing and processing goods and materials exceeding peaceful domestic requirements," as reparations, but it placed more emphasis on reparations for the countries of the Far East rather than for itself. Pauley said in his speech in Los Angeles: "Japanese industrial facilities, machinery, and equipment will soon be shipped to China and the Philippines because the rapid development of industries in Far Eastern countries other than Japan is the best guarantee against Japan launching another war of aggression." Therefore, its main purpose was to eliminate Japan's industrial base for aggression. However, China, on the one hand, attached importance to the above point, and on the other hand, equally valued Japan's reparations for its own damages to China, because China needed Japan to compensate for machinery to rebuild and develop industry in the ruins of war. Therefore, even if it was "a drop in the bucket" in the eyes of the United States, it was a valuable sweet dew to China.</p>
<p>However, whether from the perspective of eliminating Japan's industrial base for rearmament or from the perspective of rebuilding and developing its own industry, there would be no objection from the eleven countries entitled to reparations in making Japan implement reparations quickly. However, this matter is related to determining the industrial equipment that Japan should retain, and it is impossible to know what level of industrial equipment is necessary for Japan's peaceful economy before the peace treaty is signed. The signing of the peace treaty requires investigation and preparation beforehand, and even after the conference is convened, the opinions of the various countries may not be immediately consistent, so it cannot be achieved immediately. On the other hand, countries suffering from war damage are eagerly awaiting Japan's reparations. Therefore, the so-called interim reparations plan was created. The so-called interim means that before determining the peaceful industries that Japan should retain, a temporary designation is made for industrial facilities that should be used as reparations, and within the designated scope, a portion can be dismantled and shipped first. After investigating Japan's remaining industry, the Pauley Mission published the so-called interim reparations plan. Based on this plan, the Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution in May 1946, notifying MacArthur to designate factories in the twelve departments of ordnance, shipbuilding, aviation, machine tools, steel, bearings, thermal power generation, sulfuric acid, salt production, synthetic petroleum, synthetic rubber, and light metals for reparations. As a result, MacArthur designated approximately one thousand factories, with approximately ten million tons of machinery. On April 3, the United States instructed MacArthur to quickly distribute the factories, which were part of the interim reparations materials. This part of the factories accounts for approximately 30% of the total amount designated by MacArthur, with China receiving 15%, and the Philippines, Burma, the Federation of Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies each receiving 5%.</p>
<p>There are several different views on the motives behind this U.S. move. One is that because Pauley argued that the factory equipment that the Soviet Union transported from Northeast China, valued at 2 billion U.S. dollars (some say it was only worth 900 million U.S. dollars), should be included in the scope of Japan's total reparations materials and not recognized as the Soviet Union's "spoils of war," the Soviet Union held the opposite view. Therefore, it always opposed participating in the Japan reparations conference that the United States had been advocating since August 1946. The U.S.'s move was a "showdown" with the Soviet Union, with anti-Soviet effect. Another is that the U.S. recognized that several countries most severely affected by the war were in urgent need of reconstruction, so it first distributed this part of the materials. Still another is that the U.S. believed that if the reparations materials were not dismantled early, Japanese capitalists would not know which factories would be retained, and would be unwilling to actively produce, which would inevitably aggravate Japan's current economic crisis, so it took the current measure. From China's position, China urgently needs reconstruction, and at the same time, it hopes that the Japanese people can escape from the "production idleness" of the capitalists and overcome the current economic difficulties. Therefore, it should agree with this measure to quickly distribute Japanese reparations. Even if the U.S.'s motive is based on the first view, it is naturally not what China wants, because what China hopes for is international coordination, especially the coordination between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Therefore, China has always advocated that the attitude towards Japan's reparations problem should be resolved by unanimous agreement of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission. However, because the materials distributed this time are interim reparations, and are only a part of the interim reparations, when the peace conference with Japan is convened in the future, how the industrial equipment that Japan should retain should be stipulated, in what proportion should each country be distributed, and how the industrial equipment transported to the Northeast by the Soviet Union should be handled, there is still ample room for review and opportunities for resolution. Therefore, regardless of the U.S.'s motives, from China's own perspective, from Japan, and even from the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, we can and should agree with this distribution.</p>
<p>Now, the reparations materials that China will obtain amount to approximately 1.3 million tons. Although the dismantling, packaging, and transportation to Japanese ports are stipulated to be the responsibility of the Japanese government, the cost of transporting them to China and reassembling them is estimated by the Reparations Committee of the Executive Yuan to be 800 billion legal tender. Even if this estimate is not too low and the funds can be raised, and at the same time it does not affect the deficit finance, it is still not possible to solve the difficulties of the problem by relying on money alone. The difficulties of the problem are: first, in the ships. China's existing ships are all less than 300,000 tons, which is not enough to maintain domestic shipping, let alone to undertake the task of transporting this batch of reparations materials within a short period of time. In this way, we can only borrow U.S. ships, but it is said that MacArthur has previously expressed his unwillingness to send U.S. ships for transportation, so it is not necessarily optimistic whether this can be done. Secondly, even if they are transported, how to load and unload them? Are there warehouses to store them? Again, the dismantling is done by others, but the assembly must be done by ourselves. Is there no problem with this? Even if they are assembled, are there enough technicians to operate them? These problems are not simple. If the Chinese authorities do not plan in advance and seek solutions early, no one can guarantee that the bad situation of receiving enemy property in the country in the early days of victory will not be repeated. At the same time, in view of the fact that Japan, the defeated nation, has already planned for the Tao problem, and the Reparations Implementation Law has been formulated, and the details such as 12 million tons of nails and 6 million tons of steel skin required for transportation packaging have been calculated early, while China has not seen any specific decisions, so people cannot help but worry.</p>
<p>Precisely because of these difficult problems, two opinions have recently emerged in the country: one is to sell all or part of the interim reparations materials that China is entitled to to Japan or other countries; the other is to keep the materials in Japan, with China obtaining sovereignty, and entrust Japan to continue to operate them. Neither of these is a good way, especially the latter is not acceptable. This matter is contradictory to both eliminating Japan's industrial base for rearmament and China's industrial recovery, and at a time when the international situation is unpredictable, the so-called "sovereignty" is a dangerous thing with many long nights and dreams. Japan's conservative forces are very welcome to this matter. On February 20, the Speaker of the House of Peers, Shimazu Ginzō, publicly stated in the Diet: "I hope that the Allied countries will not dismantle Japan's reparations materials, but will allow Japan to continue to operate them under the supervision of a supervisory agency organized by the United Nations." This is an exposure of the mindset of Japanese financial cliques and capitalists. Whether we consider it from the perspective of China's recovery, international peace, or even the interests of the majority of the Japanese people, we should not do this kind of thing that is sought after by Japanese conservative forces. Secondly, the industrially advanced countries such as the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France will not want this batch of relatively old machines. Even if the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies need them, they have also received allocations this time. At the same time, instead of buying old ones, it is better to buy newer machines from foreign countries, so they probably will not want them either. If they are sold to Japan, it will not only give it a part of the industrial base for rearmament, but also violate the Potsdam Declaration's main purpose of emphasizing reparations in kind, turning it into monetary reparations. However, if it is absolutely necessary, adopting this method is still better than obtaining the empty name of "sovereignty." The reason is that, on the one hand, although the Potsdam Declaration emphasizes reparations in kind, it does not explicitly oppose the provisions of monetary reparations; on the other hand, if sold at a price, it can be free from restrictions on time and type, and used to purchase better machines from foreign countries. The Japanese have said: "Our machines are already old and obsolete. After the reparations materials are dismantled and transported, we can purchase new machines from the United States." Why can't China do this? The question is, how can the certainty of such a disguised form of monetary reparations be guaranteed? And is China determined to use this reparation to revive or even develop industry, like Japan's utilization method after obtaining Chinese reparations in the Sino-Japanese War? Even so, it is still inevitable that it will affect the industrial standard required to maintain Japan's peaceful economy, so the most reasonable way, of course, is for China to transport it back by itself, so that it can avoid all the disadvantages of the above two methods. Time is pressing, so let's see how the authorities will work hard.</p>

<h3>The Function of Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>— Wu Lucin</p>
<p>The establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a remarkable and progressive arrangement for the future of international relations. This progress stems partly from past painful experiences and partly from human awareness. Under the current international situation caused by different political ideologies and concepts, treaties and agreements are merely a restraint on the disruption of peace and cannot be regarded as a guarantee of lasting peace. The function of restraint is negative and temporary. This situation is similar to disputes between people that are temporarily settled through the mediation of a third party. The reason for ceasing hostilities may be due to consideration for the mediator's feelings, fear of unfavorable objective circumstances, or other reasons. However, this cessation, even to the point of shaking hands and making peace, cannot guarantee that a minor incident will not cause a falling out in the future. International relations are similar. To hope that we will no longer suffer from the scourge of war, we should focus on the positive aspects of guaranteeing peace, and contractual restraints alone are not enough. Half a century of painful experience has shown us that treaties and agreements can be turned into waste paper at any time.</p>
<p>What do I mean by focusing on the positive or active aspects? In the past, our country's designs for international relations emphasized prevention too much while neglecting foundation building. Even more pitiful is that in the designs for prevention, foresight was lacking, and the mindset was narrow. As a result, prevention became a source of trouble. Can we not admit that politicians of strong nations sowed the seeds for the Second World War as early as Versailles? At the UNESCO meeting in Paris last year, a participating delegate said, "Wars originate in the minds of men." If we want to eliminate wars, we should first start by eliminating the knots in people's minds. The factors that create these knots include racial prejudice, traditional hatred, suspicion, misunderstanding, etc. The current international situation, with its faint signs of being in the same boat in calm seas but becoming enemies again, can be said to be the lingering poison of one of these factors not being eliminated and the expansion of another factor. In the sacred task of rebuilding the world tomorrow, these ailments must be eliminated one by one, which is unquestionable. Common sense and past experience tell us that we cannot rely on treaties and agreements to cure these ailments. The restraint of treaties, even if effective for a time, cannot be expected to last forever. The reason is simple: how can social interactions between people reach the realm of righteous friendships through mere polite phrases and lavish banquets? The brotherhood proclaimed during a boisterous banquet is merely to liven up the scene and cannot cultivate genuine friendship. The improvement of relations between countries cannot be achieved through cocktail parties, nor can it be effective to sign a few treaties after a fierce battle. At this time, talking about the ideal of a unified world may feel necessary in the abstract, but we are not psychologically prepared enough, because preparations in this area are far from adequate.</p>
<p>Indeed, the advancement of science has brought countries closer together, to the point where they are like neighbors next door. However, the shortening of distance merely increases convenience. If this convenience is not used to put some effort into cultural exchange, then understanding and recognition between countries can still be very limited and superficial. Human experience tells us that there are many neighbors who live to old age without ever communicating with each other. Even if they interact, it is limited to congratulating on happy occasions and offering condolences on sad occasions, which is merely superficial. They are still far from the highest realm of friendship, "righteous friendship." How can the relations between countries be any different? Some of the current international turmoil should be attributed to the narrow-mindedness of certain ethnic groups. The expansion of this narrow-mindedness actively seeks to infiltrate other ethnic groups with its own political ideology and lifestyle, and passively causes suspicion, doubt, and fear of countries with different political ideologies and lifestyles. The result of cultural exchange can gradually create genuine understanding and recognition between each other, which is to build the foundation of genuine friendship.</p>
<p>Here, a question arises, namely the prejudice that British novelist Rudyard Kipling spoke of, "East is East, and West is West." In the general perception, it is almost believed that cultural exchange and cooperation between different ethnic groups is impossible. We acknowledge that this work is not easy, but we do not admit that it is impossible. One thing must be clarified, and that is that the culture of an ethnic group has its characteristics, and there is a commonality in culture among ethnic groups. Culture is the external manifestation of a way of life that an ethnic group has created over many years. Although the superficial lives of one ethnic group and another may differ greatly and have many distinctions, if we analyze their internal factors, we believe that cultural exchange is possible and must be useful. Because no matter how different the beliefs, sentiments, languages, or daily lives of one ethnic group and another may be, a common factor is still indispensable, and that is "human nature." And any culture is a creation of "human nature."</p>
<p>We only affirm that cultural exchange between countries is possible and must be useful. However, reaping the fruits of this usefulness is not something that can be achieved overnight. It requires time, patience, and, more importantly, open-mindedness. Each ethnic group must sincerely hope to seek recognition and understanding through cultural exchange and further influence each other. International relations must be based on mutual recognition and mutual understanding before we can talk about mutual respect and deference. And different political ideologies and different lifestyles can only be balanced under the circumstance of mutual influence. The effectiveness of cultural exchange may not be immediately apparent, but if humanity can continue to work hard in this area for a long time, its value will be immortal. In essence, this work is a prerequisite for the ideal of a unified world.</p>
<h3>Unfinished Work</h3>
<p>— Hengwei</p>
<p>Mrs. Liszt was my piano teacher, and as far as I know, she was a countess in the era of Imperial Russia. Since Lenin raised the banner of revolution, she began a life of wandering; her footprints traversed Europe, and finally, she detoured through Southeast Asia, stepping into our ancient country; because she loved the twilight of Kunming Lake, she decided to settle down.</p>
<p>"She must have been a beauty in the past," I thought when I first saw her. Because at her age, maintaining such a slender figure was truly rare and commendable. She spoke beautiful English and, unlike other old ladies, didn't like to chatter incessantly. From her elegant speech, graceful demeanor, and melancholy eyes, anyone could discern how captivating her past years must have been.</p>
<p>Her home was near Kunming Lake, a small, exquisitely decorated three-room cottage. But what caught the most attention was the oil painting hanging on the mantelpiece. It was painted so delicately, so vividly; although it was just an unfinished work.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful twilight, the lake surface shimmering with the golden light of the setting sun. After I finished playing the last movement, as usual, Mrs. Liszt would hand me a cup of coffee and say:</p>
<p>"Child, take a rest. Really, you have made progress."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Madam." I was very satisfied with my teacher's praise, even though she often encouraged me like that. After sipping a mouthful of coffee, I began to pay attention to the painting again.</p>
<p>"It's so beautiful!" I said.</p>
<p>"I say this painting is truly beautiful, Madam. But I have a question?"</p>
<p>"A question?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Madam. Look at the girl in the painting, how beautiful she is, with her green dress, soft golden hair, and a bouquet of yellow roses leaning against her chest; everything, everything seems so harmonious, so beautiful. But Madam, why is this still an unfinished work? Here, there is still a scorch mark?"</p>
<p>"Yes, child. This is an unfinished work. But, it will never be completed." She sighed sadly.</p>
<p>"Madam, do you mean that no one can finish it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, child. The person who painted this picture has already passed away."</p>
<p>"What a pity."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but sigh. But suddenly I saw that Mrs. Liszt's eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>"Madam, I'm sorry, did my words cause you sadness? You are crying?"</p>
<p>"Child, sit down, I want to tell you this story. A story about this portrait, I hope it can bring you some enlightenment."</p>
<p>Facing the sunset, in the glittering tears, she began to narrate that sad and tragic past.</p>
<p>It should be traced back to many years ago, when Countess Nona still occupied an important position in Moscow's social circles. Because of her youth and beauty, glorious family background, wealthy property, and noble title, she didn't understand what worries were, what sadness was. Although she was pursued by countless young men, she always said proudly:</p>
<p>"Let everyone love me, but I will never love anyone."</p>
<p>But one day, her pride and reserve were subjected to the most unprecedented insult and contempt in her life. It was when a rash young man walked past her, accidentally stepped on her train, and casually apologized to her, saying, "Miss, I stepped on your skirt?" in such an insouciant tone.</p>
<p>So, Nona was furious. She had never suffered such contempt. But this rash young man did not seem to value her beauty and nobility.</p>
<p>When Nona, in anger and injustice, learned that this rash young man's name was Peter Bukharaski, an eccentric painter, she decided to conquer this stubborn young man.</p>
<p>So one afternoon, this attempt with a strong romantic atmosphere began. Nona washed off the makeup on her face, changed into a student dress; carrying a set of books, she went to knock on the young painter's door; after that, she became his student.</p>
<p>Time quietly slipped away in the sunrise and sunset. Although Nona stepped into that dilapidated door every day, she brought her unique charm, beauty, and mysterious passion to that ridiculously stubborn teacher every day. So this young and stubborn painter began with surprise, and then fell head over heels.</p>
<p>But the proud Nona, when she gained spiritual satisfaction, suddenly remembered her past reserve. So it seemed like a voice was telling her:</p>
<p>"Let everyone love me, but I will never love anyone."</p>
<p>Therefore, she abandoned Peter Bukharaski without any nostalgia or hesitation.</p>
<p>For Peter Bukharaski, this was naturally nothing less than a fatal blow. His emotions were aroused by Nona; but when he madly loved her, she abandoned him again.</p>
<p>From then on, Peter used memories and tears to grope for and pursue his past happiness and sweetness. He used his unique and peculiar brush to sketch Nona's beautiful face on paper in color, to sketch his painful memories, and his lost joy.</p>
<p>Finally, the portrait was almost completed; only waiting for the final few strokes. But, the mysterious and unpredictable god of fate came to play with his experiences again. It was a harsh winter night, when Peter was concentrating on revising his work, painfully chewing on his memories, he was suddenly awakened from his painful memories by screams and firelight. When he opened his eyes, the black smoke pouring in from the window and door almost suffocated him. So without any consideration, he instinctively picked up the unfinished work and rushed out the door. But as soon as he left the door, a burning beam collapsed and hit his head, and he so miserably, tightly holding his beloved unfinished work, bid farewell to the world forever.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Liszt finished describing her story in moving words, she lowered her head and made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>So, the room was filled with suffocating silence.</p>
<p>I looked out the window, the night seemed to have become hazy. So I bid her farewell, saying:</p>
<p>"Good night, Madam. I will always remember this touching story. Thank you for your teaching and that cup of good coffee."</p>
<p>"Good night, child."</p>
<p>I didn't dare to look back at that unfinished work as I left. I hurriedly fled from Mrs. Liszt's sorrow.</p>
<p>Now it's been ten years, and I haven't seen Mrs. Liszt again. But I can't forget this touching story. Ten years is not long, but where have this sad story and its heroine drifted to?</p>
<h3>On Poetry</h3>
<p>— Bolo</p>
<p>Poetry is entirely a kind of thing where sincere emotions fill the heart and must be vented. Therefore, people say that poetry is the release of emotions, the cry of the soul. Only poets can express truth and beauty, and only in poetry can we see truth and beauty.</p>
<h3>Centennial Commemoration of Jacobsen</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Danish writer J. P. Jacobsen was born in 1847 and died in 1885. He only lived to be thirty-eight years old. This year is the centennial of his birth. I have already translated a section from Topsoe Jensen's "Scandinavian Literature" and given it to "Literary Tide Monthly," and now I am translating Magnus's "Dictionary of European Literature," just to add a little embellishment.</p>
<p>"Jacobsen, Jons Peter Jacobsen, 1847-1885, Danish novelist; worked as a botanist and translated Darwin's works into Danish. In 1876, he wrote "Mistress Marie Grubbe." This book is quite difficult to read, but it was painstakingly created. In 1852, he published "Mogens and other short stories." In 1880, he published "Niels Lyhne," which was translated into English as "Siren Voices," (Note: The sirens are found in Greek mythology and Homer's epics. She is one of the three beautiful goddesses on an island near the Italian coast, and legend has it that she uses her singing to lure passing sailors to their demise. When Odysseus passed by, he was afraid that many of the soldiers under him would be bewitched by her.) Saintsbury (the author of the famous three-volume literary criticism history), after the glorious Danish critic Brandes, praised Jacobsen as indeed forward-thinking; his personal view is that the author has the talent of Turgenev and Flaubert. Boyesen's opinion in "Scandinavian Literature" is not as enthusiastic. He feels that Jacobsen</p>
<p>"embellishes mediocrity with study," making the reader "feel compassionate weariness."</p>
<p>Recently, Li Changzhi published a book called "Northern European Literature" at the Commercial Press, with a section on Jacobsen on pages 61-64. Additional references include: Zheng Zhenduo's "Literary Outline," Volume 4, pages 427-8; Mao Dun's "Perspectives on Modern Literature," pages 16-9; Macy's "Stories of World Literature," pages 650-1; Li Juhsiu's "Outline of World Literary History," page 254; Jin Shisheng's "Outline of European Literary History," page 213. Jacobsen's rare works do not seem to have been translated in China yet.</p>
<h3>Remaining Words from the Shuang Yu Xuan Collection</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Although it's said the flowers came early this year, I didn't seek spring, already lamenting the scarcity of fragrant blossoms; the past events of Jiangnan still fill me with sorrow, the reunions always make other people's homes seem better. She is still as graceful as she was then, suddenly we meet, but alas, she vanishes like a startled swan; from now on, the rivers and mountains will shame my dreams, hearing of it, I still lament my own downfall.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Again, weak catkins drift to the ends of the earth, grass grows and orioles fly, remembering every road in Jiangnan; hundreds of sheets of paper filled with thousands of words, letters sink like fish, geese vanish, who knows where they are. I remember lingering for a short stay when the flowers bloomed, never expecting that spring would bring such leisure to the courtyard; every night, my soul searches for old companions, already knowing that the dream fur coat has no basis.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Last night, the wind and rain were sudden and heavy, tear stains on my pillow, writing out all my longing; outside the building, I stand idly, still glimpsing the place where we parted. Waiting for spring to come and spring to pass, spring goes and spring comes, the mood is always the same; the swallows chirping in pairs should be laughing, how could youthful years be so filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Last night's stars and night rain, for the sake of affection, for the sake of deep promise, the stream should know the pain of separation, going to the long pavilion morning after morning. The red is sparse and the green gathers at the edge of my eyes, spring has already departed, yet I still sing the Golden Thread song; I double my earnest words, that at the ends of the earth, I can only cherish you forever.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Outside the curtain, the small peach blossoms bloom and fall again, not resenting spring's departure, but remembering our promise of the past; it should be that the world pities my loneliness, water flows and flowers wither, it is not something to be taken lightly. No heavy brocade curtain is hung on the branches, the rain and wind, is the light still as it was yesterday? My love for you is deep, my nature is weak, let the willow catkins drift together.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Crickets chirping on all four walls urge on the dark rain, autumn is already deep, there is no leisure mood; sorrow and joy all go with the flowing water, still, I hear the Golden Thread song for no reason. I remember living in the city with green willows, picking emeralds and searching for fragrances, not knowing the pain of separation; there must be old places where hairpins were left behind, over the years, it has all been mistaken by longing.</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— Magai</p>
<p>Marquet (1875-) is a favorite student of Moreau and is now a basic member of the Salon. His style is vigorous and refined, on par with Vanton and others, and he is an active member of the core writers in the modern Parisian art scene. This work is not large and was purchased by Mr. Oharu. (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 316</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>At this time, it was about twelve thirty in the afternoon, the sun was scorching, and it was extremely hot. Zheng Yan made a phone call and came out, seeing that Tsurumi was not in the car, but was standing under the shade of the Broadway Hotel gate across the street, looking out towards the Bund. Zheng Yan quickly drove across the street and told Tsurumi that a room had been reserved at the International Hotel, coincidentally number 915 again; friends had also been invited, and they could meet there between four and five o'clock, without fail. He also said that he had called the "Public Works Department" car office in the name of the Japanese military to inquire about the "10915" license plate number. According to the car office, it was the license plate number of the Japanese Ambassador Okamoto's car, but the car body was not black, but dark blue, a 1936 Dodge, eight-cylinder streamlined sedan.</p>
<p>"Your knowledge has really improved, ha..." Tsurumi laughed.</p>
<p>"Yes, thank you for the captain's praise. Now that we don't need to go to the International Hotel, and it's lunchtime, the subordinate would like to invite the captain to taste Chinese Southern-style imperial cuisine..."</p>
<p>"That fits my ideal... but we have to deal with that public garden case nearby first. The driver said that the Bund Park is over there... Have the car wait here, we'll go over quietly and take a look. I see you've brought your gear, have you loaded your bullets?...”</p>
<p>This Bund Park is not much bigger than the palm of a hand, and it's also a long, narrow strip along the river, how can it be considered a park? But because Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, being able to set aside this open space in this land worth five or six hundred thousand gold pieces per mu (referring to the estimated price more than a decade ago), and even adding things like a music pavilion, goldfish pond, lawn, and flower bed, it would be unfair to such high land prices to say it's not a park.</p>
<p>But during the day, there are no big trees in the park, and in the scorching summer, besides the Western restaurant seats and two or three small pavilions, there is simply no place to cool off, so it can only be said to be a night garden.</p>
<p>(This park is small, but in Shanghai, everyone knows it. The biggest thing is that outside the park gate, there used to be a sign that read "Chinese and dogs not allowed!" This sign, although it was about Chinese people and dogs, dogs have no writing and don't understand that, but it was written in both Chinese and English. English is a common language in Shanghai; and the "Chinese and dogs..." words are extremely simple, so even all kinds of foreigners, such as Russians, French, Germans, Italians, Austrians, Spanish, Portuguese, etc., at least the people and children, all understand the meaning of the sign; at a minimum, they can understand that "Chinese" and "dogs" are placed on an equal footing.</p>
<p>Generally, Chinese people with blood in their veins are certainly resentful of this insulting sign, but because there were guns and cannons supporting it behind the sign, they didn't dare to publicly destroy it. However, some people asked strangely: "Wasn't this Chinese translated by Chinese people? Wasn't it written with a stroke of the Chinese brush? Wasn't it carved by Chinese people? When these translators, writers, and carvers received this order from the foreigners, why didn't they spill their blood five steps away and fight to the death? That translator, who was able to translate these words, and the writer who could write them in one stroke, should at least have shown some spirit!"</p>
<p>But another group of people explained it this way: After the Central Government's Northern Expedition succeeded, foreigners became a little paranoid, thinking that the Chinese had achieved a positive result, and voluntarily tore down that sign insulting the Chinese, not only tearing down the sign, but also opening up the park gate, allowing "people" to enter and exit freely. This group of people personally saw some "people" taking the attitude of "reclaiming" lost land, rushing in, picking the flowers, breaking off the branches, and scooping up the goldfish; one person occupying a four or five-foot-long seat, lying on their back and sleeping soundly; the rest spitting and urinating everywhere; scraping tree bark and signing their names; "XXX was here" was written all over the rocks and walls in various "literary" works. This group of people all said that the "people"'s behavior was too brave! So the next day, the "Chinese and dogs" sign was hung high again at the park entrance.)</p>
<p>The above passage happened in this Bund Park.</p>
<h3>Jin Shengtan's Astronomical Views</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>Recently, I came across the "Compilation of Talented Scholar Books in the Singing Hall," and when I opened the first chapter, it turned out to be Jin Shengtan's "Lecture on the Book of Changes." The Book of Changes is very difficult to explain, and Lin Yutang got into trouble because of it and had to hurriedly fly back to the United States. Jin Shengtan was a master of humor in the early Qing Dynasty, so let's see how he explained the Book of Changes:</p>
<p>"The southern great fire star is uniquely called a star because it is the guiding star. The twenty-eight constellations are astronomy (also known as the twenty-eight gold), the sky is round, the horn has many stars, the neck has many stars, so the horn constellation and the neck constellation are also round, and the rest are the same. East, West, North, South, Above, and Below are geography, objects are mixed so it is called Wen, and mixed without exceeding so it is called Li."</p>
<p>The sky is really too big, and in the eyes of literati, it is really difficult to understand: East is Jia Yi wood, South is Bing Ding fire, and so on, naturally it can fool the villagers; but it also makes people feel that astronomy and geography are inseparable from the five elements of yin and yang. Using astronomy, one can act coquettishly with the emperor and please him; using geography, one can divine burial and discover royal qi. The power of magic is indeed too amazing, but it also finally turned our astronomers and alchemists into one. The "sky" seen in the naked eye is different for each person, and what Jin Shengtan said is just one example.</p>
<p>I think, the alchemists probably had self-awareness at first, and what they did and said was just deception, collecting money, and getting a meal; but later, I don't know why, they became more and more serious. "Looking up to observe the great Wen, Wen is Manjusri; looking down to examine the geography, Puxian is Puxian. The astronomy is round, there is no ordinary person because of it; the geography is square, there is already a Bodhisattva because of it..." Continuing like this, they gradually discovered their own extraordinaryness: believing that what others have not seen, only they can see; what others do not understand, only they can answer with ancestral secrets, the sky that originally only needed to be explored with a telescope, was made more and more mysterious and more and more terrible by them.</p>
<p>Using the identity of a master of humor to cross-dress as a righteous man, rambling on about heaven and earth, refusing to stop, if it is taken as a satire of the alchemists, it is a very humorous thing, but unfortunately it is not, the master is putting on his solemn face. Look at his nonsense:</p>
<p>"Astronomy only allows you to observe, Guanshiyin observes all directions, inside and out, the shadow does not fall in the same container, and then escapes a secluded word. Geography is only three changes, you just wholeheartedly. If you don't achieve the previous method, then there is no cause and no effect, how do you know that the previous is not the later, the later is not the previous, the above and below are also clear, and then you can prove a clear word."</p>
<p>I don't know what he is talking about, I only hear a buzzing sound.</p>
<p>The road from theology to metaphysics is short, but the road from metaphysics to science is long. Chinese literati have been trapped in the pit of metaphysics and cannot extricate themselves; Wang Yangming is still like that, let alone Jin Shengtan. Therefore, I think that it is better for him to comment on the West Chamber and Water Margin than to talk about astronomy and geography.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Our Accusation - A Call for Support for Newspapers Destroyed in Various Places</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>The press community recently faces a difficult season. It's not just that rising prices and meager incomes have severely threatened their survival. It's also not just that the precarious situation and failed peace talks make it difficult to write and choose words. Even the publication of a short news item often provokes resentment and triggers a huge wave! In the past two months, newspapers in Chengdu, Hankou, Changchun, Fuzhou, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang have been destroyed for such small matters. The strangest thing is that the destroyers are not local thugs, but people belonging to the intellectual class!</p>
<p>China's newspaper industry, like the old "Shen Bao," has a history of more than seventy years, but the true period of prosperity for the newspaper industry has been in the last decade. However, unfortunately, in these ten years, the newspapers in the occupied areas have suffered under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, and dozens of reporters have been martyred. The newspapers in the free areas have faced material and spiritual difficulties, and writing about it is truly full of bitterness - but we have no complaints. We recognize that everything must be for the victory of the war; at the same time, we also remember that there must be a broad future for the press community after the war. The war was won, but we lost all our ideals; but what can we do? People must continue to live, and our work must continue. Even though the newspaper business is so difficult, we still stand on this post, enduring the wind, frost, rain, and snow. The lagging era is whipping us to "catch up," the dark society is forcing us to uphold justice, and various objective circumstances make every conscientious journalist deeply feel that their responsibility is even greater. So everyone puts their personal poverty behind them in the face of arduous work.</p>
<p>For peace and democracy, for the revival of China, this is the common desire of the Chinese people. We express our conscience and also spread the voices of the majority. However, when we slightly touch the pain of a certain person or a certain group, we are subjected to an illegal "punishment" ( (!)) Newspapers can be destroyed, reporters can be beaten, there is no room for defense, no right to comment or accuse. This unfortunate event is more tragic and unbearable than any pain we have suffered in the past ten years!</p>
<p>Newspapers must meet with readers every day, and no one can guarantee that there will be no mistakes. However, right and wrong should be judged through reasonable means. Punishment should only be carried out by government agencies. If everyone can take revenge for personal grievances, then newspapers will never have a chance to be published! Especially those who are members of the intellectual class, who usually call for democracy and lead the masses, how can they use violence against the "mouthpiece of democracy" and the "public opinion of the people"?</p>
<p>Here, I would like to say a word to the members of the press community. The misfortunes we are encountering today, on the other hand, show our strength. Those who destroy public opinion do so because public opinion itself has struck at their vitals. We should be pleased with our suffering.</p>
<h3>News Digest</h3>
<p>— Railways</p>
<p>If the draft regulations on house rentals are enacted, they could break the "gold bar" fortress of Shanghai. Those of us who have no gold bars and no houses to live in don't know how to express our congratulations.</p>
<p>But some of the legal provisions are of no use. For example, "mandatory leasing of surplus houses" and "no taking of tips" (i.e., the most vicious "gold bar" premium set by Shanghainese) cannot be effective unless the security authorities enforce them strictly.</p>
<p>Life is becoming more and more insecure, yet prices are soaring endlessly; the temptations of extravagance, luxury, and licentiousness make the wind of corruption spread without end.</p>
<p>The corruption case in the clothing factory of the General Headquarters of Joint Services is only one end of thousands upon thousands of corruption cases.</p>
<p>The cause of the major fires has been announced by the responsible authorities. Most are due to carelessness with fire; either a discarded cigarette butt caused a major disaster, or other sparks of fire created a terrifying sea of flames. There is no need to be suspicious. Shanghainese themselves being "careful with fire" is the proper way to prevent fires.</p>
<p>Russians open their doors on Easter, and young men can freely enter homes and kiss the girls.</p>
<p>This is the fundamental difference between European and Asian national character.</p>
<p>John Ken said, "Asians are weak and lack perseverance." Customs and habits and private life also show the conservatism and rigidity of Easterners everywhere.</p>
<p>If Chinese girls one day have the courage to welcome the embraces and kisses of male guests, their attitude towards life should be much more open than it is now.</p>
<p>It is said that the Qingbai football team specifically increased its manpower to challenge Donghua in Shanghai, spending over ten million yuan. As a result, this match was aborted. I personally think that "Donghua" should have played the match. As the saying goes, "Victory and defeat are common in war." If it is for the sake of observing each other's skills, even if defeated, it does not matter. Why doesn't Donghua fight?</p>
<p>Some say, if the Japanese football and baseball teams trained under MacArthur come to challenge Shanghai in the future, should our Great Republic of China's teams consider war? (Readers may wish to write their opinions on this matter)</p>
<p>Dying from being squeezed on a train means that, in any case, the two Railway Administrations should bear full responsibility. The Railway Bureau has never been considerate of passengers, but it sells an unlimited number of tickets for each train. The railway authorities should pay great attention to this and improve it.</p>
<h3>"County Magistrate"</h3>
<p>— Shao Zhensi</p>
<p>In the newspaper on the 9th, there was this news:</p>
<p>Having been a county magistrate for nine years, he committed 82 crimes, averaging one crime every 40 days.</p>
<p>As a result, he was sentenced to eight death sentences and four life imprisonments. Because there is only one Gu Ying, only one death sentence can be executed. The remaining "residual evils"—seven death sentences and four life imprisonments—have to be buried with Gu Ying!</p>
<p>Nine years in office cannot be considered short, and 82 cases cannot be considered few. Only now has it been exposed. This is a complete depiction of the local gentry's "muddle-headedness."</p>
<p>A parent official committing as many as 82 crimes in nine years shows the power of this local emperor!</p>
<p>Assuming that Gu Ying committed the first case and was then reported and sentenced, then on the day of this "proving his identity," it might be the day of "release after serving his term." It is truly fitting to cry injustice for Gu Ying.</p>
<h3>He Was Not Drunk</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Policeman: "Hey, do you know who I am?"</p>
<p>Drunk: "I don't really know you, but if you tell me your house number, I'd be happy to take you home."</p>

<h3>"Unending Love"</h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>"Unending Love" tells the story of a love affair between a young girl, Yu Jiayin, and a young man, Xia Zongyu. Xia has a wife. In the end, Jiayin leaves in order not to destroy Zongyu's family. Between them, they leave behind this unfinished love.</p>
<p>The author, Zhang Ailing, makes the issue of love and family the theme of the play. But she cannot give you a healthy answer. She still ends this "unending love" inconclusively.</p>
<p>The reason for this inconclusive ending is that the author lacks a sound ideology and discernment. In this story, the love between Chu Jiayin and Xia Zongyu lacks a sound foundation in itself. Jiayin's departure is merely out of selfishness. She does not want others to hate her in the future. She is not an awakening and sympathy for the sake of the happiness of others. She fully expresses the weakness and selfishness in the character of this person; therefore, she only escapes. If Zongyu's wife died in the hospital, and Zongyu chased after her to Xiamen, then they would definitely be together. But how could the future Jiayin not have the same fate as Zongyu's current wife, because Jiayin and Zongyu's wife are not much different? They are not united because of common thoughts and careers.</p>
<p>This subject is a women's issue, but the author does not start from here. She does not focus on women's occupations and lives. She turns the problem to Jiayin's father, and even from this point, she forcibly relates and twists the development of the story and characters. The author can only make the disc fall into failure. The whole play can only end inconclusively.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the writing of the script, it is sometimes comedy and sometimes tragedy. It is extremely inconsistent, which affects the integrity of the performance. Director Sang Hu has obviously put a lot of effort into handling the play, and many small details are arranged very cleverly and appropriately. But there are too many problems with the editing of the play.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan's Yu Jiayin plays very naturally. The disadvantage is that she cannot grasp several emotional and exciting main scenes. Liu Qiong only has a few scenes and cannot talk about good or bad. Yan Su's Yu father and Lu Shan's Yao mother are both too exaggerated, especially the former. Zhang Fu's Xia's wife has few scenes, but she plays them extremely well.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Scene</h3>
<p>Xu Jie recently had a collection of short stories published by Kaiming Bookstore, entitled "Awkward Collection." Most of the content is about the life of university professors in the rear during the War of Resistance, who are poor, depressed, and mentally distressed, which makes people feel sympathy. The other articles also depict the visage of difficult reality. The author said: "Expose this reality, overthrow this reality, or pursue the light, and foreshadow the beginning of the light!"</p>
<p>The April issue of "Middle School Student" magazine has been published. This issue includes "A Literary Talk by Students and Writers," written by Xiao Qian, Lü Shuxiang, Zang Kejia, Quan Lin, Li Guangtian, Ping Bo, Shi Yi, Ke Zhongping, Cao Bohan, and Ding Yi, which is extremely helpful for readers to understand and learn about literature and art. In addition, there are many articles by Sheng Tao, Bin Ran, Chen Yuan, Gu Junzheng, Xu Cifu, and Zhao Qing Shi.</p>
<h3>Red Notice</h3>
<p>— Xia Tianwu</p>
<p>On a modern building, a red notice was posted on a round revolving pillar of cement and steel, which looked a bit obtrusive. However, after all, it was a magnificent notice, which was indeed eye-catching.</p>
<p>When a new official takes office, a red notice is posted as usual, stating that "by order of such and such," he will take office immediately.</p>
<p>After the revolution, the Qing Dynasty was destroyed, and the Republic of China began. Everything was renewed. At that time, red notices were all over the country. Although they were everywhere, the people's hearts were full of excitement and hope. However, when the traitor Yuan usurped power and falsely used titles, the concept that the red notices gave to the people was completely changed, replacing excitement with disgust and hope with contempt. The life of the red notice was dyed gray.</p>
<p>The stage of the revolution and restoration in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China was a rebirth of the people's psychology. In fact, the people seemed to breathe in a breath of fresh air. At that time, there was a characteristic: it seemed that red notices were not often seen. New officials also took office, but it seemed that no one wanted to be scolded as feudal and counter-revolutionary!</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the red notice? It is a feudal relic, I do not agree with it, right? Red is a symbol of auspiciousness, red is a symbol of happiness. Getting a new official, praying for auspiciousness, getting a new official, full of joy, but we on the people's side must think, the so-called auspiciousness, is it for him to auspiciously make money? Full of joy, that is even more unspeakable, not only the new official himself, but even the little brother-in-law's aunt's grandmother's nephew is afraid of getting a joy!</p>
<p>What is the impression and concept of red notices in the minds of the people today? I am afraid it is a piece of numbness. We have eaten oil that costs 4,000 yuan per catty of reserve notes, and today we are eating oil that costs 3,600 yuan per catty of legal tender. What is the fun of red notices? Generally, people who are a little older will have a kind of nostalgia rising, returning to the red notices of the early Republic of China.</p>
<p>Today, I don't want to ask for a good official, can I get a new official who does not want to post a red notice to take office?</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Have you packed your things? Let's go!" Zhu Zhaonian of the Machine Battalion urged Lan in this way immediately.</p>
<p>Lan only nodded, and Lao Zhu ran out like a fly, calling Lao Huang and A Li in to help Lan's cousin move things.</p>
<p>At this time, Fatty Xu's face had been slapped several times by his wife, and the Hawaiian shirt on his upper body was also crumpled. Lao Zhu knew that it would be even worse to go up and persuade him, so he winked at Lan.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Ming! Sister-in-law Ming!" Lan immediately understood his meaning and hurried over to laugh and shout, "Let Brother-in-law Ming go! It's Zhu's fault! Don't blame him! If you guys do this again, I won't be able to save face either! Let me apologize to you!"</p>
<p>"It's none of your business!" But Mrs. Xu, who is famous for her prestige, is not someone to reason with. "I just want to ask him why he didn't open his dog eyes and make friends with this bastard? I want to divorce him! I want to divorce him!..."</p>
<p>While she was speaking, although she did not let go, her mind was distracted. Fatty Xu took this opportunity, gave a strong tremor, jumped out of the heavy garden, and ran madly out of the door, ignoring his life. So his honorable wife also cried and chased after him.</p>
<p>Lan and Zhu Zhaonian couldn't help but smile bitterly at each other.</p>
<p>This is the train station!</p>
<p>Almost all that one's vision can see is a dark mass. That pile is people, that pile is luggage; those people are going to get on the train, those people are station staff, those people are here to see them off, no one needs to think about distinguishing them. And the movement of people is so chaotic, so endless, that everyone who first comes into contact with this realm will naturally have a misconception, as if even the luggage is moving!</p>
<p>This is still the situation on the road outside the station. Inside the station, it is simply a solid formed by people and luggage. If you grow wings and fly over other people's heads, otherwise you don't have to think about going in.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu took Lan and two children and was blocked on the road four or five hundred yards away from the station. He couldn't see the scene inside the station at all, and he couldn't even see any shadows of the train. All that was heard in the ears was the noisy sound of people, but there was no need to think about hearing a clear and complete sentence. Even they themselves felt it difficult to speak. (43)</p>
