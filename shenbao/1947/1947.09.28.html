<p>又孫科博士最近與合衆社記者談</p>

<p>邢局長垂詢極詳·似甚欣悅。旋</p>
<p>召全體員工訓話，略稱：塘沽新</p>
<p>港關係整個北方榮枯，政府極重</p>
<p>視，兩千年前四川灌縣太安李冰</p>
<p>興築都江堰後，每年能灌溉田地</p>
<p>三百萬畝，迄今川人每年祭祀，</p>
<p>祟功報德，但此川省最大水利工</p>
<p>程，較諸新港工程，仍屬小巫見</p>
<p>大巫，目前國家支出浩業，經費</p>

<p>最多之軍隊擺在華北。經濟方而</p>
<p>，資委會大部財力供花於華北，</p>
<p>第一流工程人才，亦多在北方，</p>
<p>故無論軍事。政治：人事，均足</p>
<p>表示中央對北方之重視。對外傳</p>
<p>幣制改革之說，據謂：專家學者</p>
<p>均在硏究，並時有意見貢獻，政</p>
<p>府亦甚注意，惟目前條件尙未具</p>
<p>備，政府亦未決定辦法，何時可</p>

<p>待。又王等此次調查最重視者為積貯碼頭之自備外匯所購物</p>
<p>資，政院之東視此事·即因彼等此次調査所引證據。參加此</p>
<p>次調查之某監委談：積貯碼頭之物資，有一部份為生產品及</p>
<p>原料，此類物資自應允其入口，惟下不爲例。至大　汽車，</p>
<p>其價格成在政府規定之一千二百美元以上·當不能令其入口</p>
<p>，惟必欲令其運回歐美等原輸出地點，亦不可能，其唯一可</p>
<p>能，爲經由香港走私入境，以高價出售，與其如此，不若另</p>
<p>謀妥壽對策，允其入口，加以限制爲　。</p>
<p>定緊縮貸款，然對出口貿易則決</p>
<p>極力扶助，且外匯管制辦法改進</p>
<p>後，出口已火爲增加。記者詢及</p>

<p>張，平市長何思源同來，傅作義</p>
<p>率綏署，省府各首長親往機塲迎</p>
<p>接，張於軍樂聲中下機，檢閱儀</p>
<p>仗隊，山傳卞任陪同人城，巡視</p>
<p>一週，民衆來　歡呼，午出席各</p>
<p>界觀迎大會講演，首謂：愈到邊</p>
<p>疆，愈感同胞可敬，可愛。張家</p>
<p>口軍民所表現奮發活潑氣象·象</p>
<p>徵國家前逾光明，張氏譽傳將軍</p>
<p>爲北方長城，深感傳對治軍收民</p>
<p>很得要領，尤與士兵同甘苦，接</p>
<p>近民衆，熟悉民間疾苦，印象至</p>
<p>爲深刻。張家口收復不及一年·</p>
<p>各方面能有如此成就，甚爲欽佩</p>
<p>，並勉軍民張家口爲北部國防大</p>
<p>門，中央向所重視，應在傅主任</p>

<p>，完成戡亂建國任務。張氏精神</p>
<p>愉快，語極懇切，掌聲雷動。張</p>
<p>院長繼之以擺龍門陣方式接見記</p>
<p>者，答覆從南京到北方不同感覺</p>
<p>時稱：華北，東北外憂內患，人</p>
<p>民在水深火熱中所受痛苦最爲深</p>
<p>切，中央向爲軫念，北方經濟生</p>
<p>活困苦，政治設施簡陋，而人民</p>
<p>所表現之熱烈情緒，彌覺珍視，</p>
<p>北方蘊藏　富，並有相當工業規</p>
<p>模，可做爲國家經濟建設基地，</p>
<p>目前應注意把握人心，建國必先</p>
<p>建人，建人問題解決，其他建設</p>
<p>才有辦法。以平滬比較，氏謂：</p>
<p>上海爲中國之第一大都市，人民</p>
<p>奢靡·北平爲上下五千年古城，</p>
<p>民氣消沉，極需轉移風氣。對蒙</p>
<p>旂自治問題·表示推行地方自治</p>
<p>爲政府旣定方針，蒙胞有其特殊</p>
<p>生活習慣，傳統政制制度，擬定</p>
<p>自治法時，應注意顧及，推行自</p>
<p>治應有準備，有步驟，不可草率</p>
<p>，當前匪患未平，由東北至西北</p>
<p>均未安定·應在軍事第一，安全</p>
<p>第一目標下，團結努力，共號時</p>
<p>艱，本蒙漢合作之精神，遵從憲</p>
<p>法規定程序，逐步扶持蒙旂自決</p>
<p>。氏對整飭吏治，肅淸貪汚，認</p>
<p>爲須正本淸源，提高待遇·穩定</p>
<p>生活，各種辦法與組識，應防止</p>
<p>貪汚機會，政府除採用檢興嚴懲</p>
<p>等治標辦法外，對改善公務人員</p>
<p>生活，愼選官吏，嚴格考核獎懲</p>
<p>，合法保障均注意實施，並希提</p>
<p>高社會守法精神，轉移風氣·人</p>
<p>人明法祟法，始能根絕貪汚現象</p>
<p>。氏最後表示，對邊疆新聞事業</p>
<p>至爲關懷，中央決予有效扶持，</p>
<p>張氏蒞察雖僅數小時，仍能以四</p>
<p>十分鐘時問與記者暢談，狀甚慰</p>
<p>快。張氏下午出席工作會報，聽</p>
<p>取軍政，業務，建設各方報吿，</p>
<p>指示頗　·慰勉有加。午後四時</p>
<p>仍乘原機返平，張氏來張雖僅六</p>
<p>小時，留給軍民印象極深，緣張</p>
<p>氏尙爲政治顯要來張第一人，軍</p>
<p>民熱情洋　中，充分顯示邊民對</p>
<p>政府之竭誠擁戴。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕據民航局發言人稱，自美訂購之</p>
<p>强力跑道燈三套，即將運抵滬。該項跑道燈自一九四三年後</p>
<p>，美軍即廣泛採用，能放射燭光極高之光炬，於夜問或在「</p>
<p>能見度」不佳之白　，可助飛機安全起降。據稱，該三套設</p>
<p>備遲達後即將裝設於滬，穗，漢三地機場，一俟　設完竣，</p>
<p>國內飛航安全將獲一更有力之保障。</p>
<h3>禁營業性舞廳</h3>
<p>政委咸主貫澈政令</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕禁止營</p>
<p>業性舞場問題，廿七日晨提出於</p>
<p>臨時政務會議中討論，各政委一</p>
<p>致認為，必須貫澈政令·責成滬</p>
<p>市府切實辦理。</p>
<h3>國代展期投票選縂準予以追認　選舉程序亦經修正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕選總委</p>
<p>會廿七日舉行第十一次會議，張</p>
<p>厲生主席·首先報吿此次國大代</p>
<p>表投票”期展延一月之經過，並</p>
<p>提請追認。略稱：〔國大代表選</p>
<p>舉之重要進程·依據各方報吿，</p>
<p>各省市選所均在認真趕辦，求其</p>
<p>如期實現，然事實願示有不能如</p>
<p>期循程分途並進之勢。爲迅籌補</p>
<p>救之討，決律與事實終無兩全之</p>
<p>道，惟有將原定國大代表投票日</p>
<p>期酌予展延至十一月廿一日至廿</p>
<p>三日·實際上恰爲展期一月，雖</p>
<p>與　政實施準備程序之規定無不</p>
<p>出入　而於國大選舉之表示鄭重</p>
<p>，則　益良多。上述意見爲求適</p>
<p>合事機並趕於本週國務會議之前</p>
<p>，呈龍國府提請核議示遵起見，</p>
<p>業已備文請國府提國務會議決議</p>

<p>患病，乘坐蘇聯軍用機飛赴平壤</p>
<p>，再乘火車抵達漢城。今日在此</p>
<p>宣稱，大連在碌軍監督之下，現</p>
<p>由能操日語之中國人士管理·市</p>
<p>政府各重要職位均係親蘇派充當</p>
<p>，但此等中國人士是否共產黨則</p>
<p>未說明。大述市民共計百萬餘人</p>
<p>，口僑約廿五萬業經遣送回國，</p>
<p>大部份華人亦已移居中國政府控</p>
<p>制地區，目前數字不逮遠甚。港</p>
<p>口統歸蘇聯船隻使用，每週有二</p>
<p>至七艘停泊，顯係取道前往旅順</p>
<p>或海參崴。大連瀋陽鐵路交通久</p>

<h3>郵電火軍加價案　交部向政院提四項原則按各地指數分數區調整</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕郵電火軍公用事業加價辦法·據</p>
<p>交部廿七日向政院臨時會議所提之方案中擬員四項原則：</p>
<p>分區加價，按各地生活指數不同，將全國分爲數區調整。</p>
<p>按照成本調整，目前郵電　蝕太鉅，若依成本加價，則郵資</p>
<p>平信須增爲二千五百元，電報電話增加一倍，收支始可平衡</p>
<p>。　顧及人民負祖，酌予調整，不足之數仍由政府補貼。</p>
<p>仍維舊價繼續由政府補貼。經　決付審査·交下次會討論。</p>
<h3>禁售洋貨奢侈品　取締辦法政院交會審查　進出口貿易辦法第九條條文修正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕根據厲行節約消費辦法綱要之規定，凡禁中進口之物品，於該綱要公</p>
<p>布兩月後，在市場上發見時，將由政府予以沒收。經濟部據此已擬定「取締禁止進口物品銷售</p>
<p>辦法」，送早政院，經廿七日臨時院會討論後，決定交付審査。據悉：　辦法所稱禁止進口物</p>
<p>品，係指洋酒，外國香烟，修指甲用全副器具，零件，撲粉粉盒，疏妝盒，香水，脂粉，純</p>
<p>絲或難綫針織綫緞，純絲或雜綫剪絨以及其他各種奢侈品，但品名相同之貨不在取締之列。此</p>
<p>項禁止物品，分爲甲。乙兩項，甲項自卅七年元旦起，全國同時禁止銷售，乙項由政府於適</p>
<p>當時期通令禁止·該批物品經　務機關沒收査封·在處分　送滿冊日後，定期發賣，其所得</p>
<p>價款，以百分之卅提充密報人民及査獲員　一金·其餘則充作救濟難民之用。禁止進口物品之</p>
<p>鑑定，由主管機關召集當地每會，商會及有關同業公會代表，組禁止進口物品　別委會負責辦</p>
<p>理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕進出口貿易辦法第九條，對於進口商未經領得　人許　證件前，不得</p>
<p>向國外洽預訂購貨品手續之規定，頃已決定修正爲：「進口商未經領得輸人許可證件前，不得</p>
<p>向國外訂定購貨合同，亦不得將貨品由國外起運」·業經廿七日政院臨時會通過，並公布施行</p>
<p>。　原規定封於進口商業實際情況，尚有難行之處，因　現行核給輪入許可證辦法不論何種貨</p>
<p>品，均須由商人提供洽購貨品之證件，否則貨品之性質及價格無法確定，其輪入申請之合理與</p>
<p>否，亦無從審查。　遠期交易之大宗商品如棉花之類，商人定購期貨，已成商業慣例，未使再</p>
<p>更·亦無阻止之必要·長期供應之大宗貨品，如柴油·汽油·煤油　類船運計劃，須於起運數</p>
<p>月前確定，如不准其先期洽辦訂購及運輪手續者，此項主要區料之售給，恐將陷於停頓。根據</p>
<p>以上理由，故予以修正。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕行政院廿七日上午九時舉行第二次臨時會議，下副院長主席，決議</p>
<p>各案擇載如次：　國有土地管理機關及權限之劃分案，照審査修正之原則通過。　電業法案，</p>

<h3>政治改革與人才問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 杜佐周</p>
<p>政治改革的呼聲，近來已響澈　　。“窮則變，變則通”，現在確實已到了非變不可的關頭了。不過，一談政治改革，不能不令人首先聯想到人才問題。</p>
<p>政治的道理，本來極平凡。“得人者昌，失人者亡”，這句老生常談對今日一切未走上法治正軌的中國，還不失其正確性。我們不崇尚“人治”，不提倡“好人政府”同時，更認為英雄主義或痛快主義的政治改革，也決不是今日政治上根本解決問題的辦法。可是我們對人才主義卻有一個新的看法：我們認為民主政治，狹義地說，應該就是“人盡其才”的政治。因為政治問題，歸根結蒂，實際總離不了人的問題。國父　政，謂“政為衆人之事，而管理眾人之事，即為政治。”這些“衆人”　　都是“阿斗”，而“管理眾人之事”的，縱不全是“諸葛亮”，卻無疑的需要人才。這是現代民主政治的起碼條件，否則所謂“民主”就會流為“　民政治”或“愚民政治”。</p>
<p>對待人才的方法，亦有各時代的不同。在封建專制時代，只是消極地求其效忠服貼，以不造反為主。所以除對付“　首”采取“民可使由之不可使知之”的愚民政策外，對士子就采取以科舉功名為的　牢龍政策。使“天下英雄盡入吾　中”。在封建統治者的心目中，所謂人才頂好就是奴才，這自然根本談不上“人盡其才”。在民主政治下，人盡其才的意義，第一是培養人才，使人人獲　其個性與天才之自由充分的發展；第二是任用人才，使人才有出路，并各得其所；第三是維　人才，使各安其位，各抒其抱負。人才問題的解決，不僅消極地促進政治的清明與安定，而現代政治的復雜化，專門化，自尤非引用專門人才不能勝任愉快，而真正民主精神的發揮，更惟有求之於所有“管理眾人之事”者，都有在政治上自由平等地發展其天才與抱負的希望。</p>
<p>先看政治的本身：貪污與低能，幾為一般與論所指責，誠不必待魏德邁的批評，我們也早已承認一個“政治和經濟改革”為如何需要。但一切問題談到末子，總是人為的因素居多。一個歐美良好的制度搬到中國來，往往“　　淮而為枳”；而任何一個好聽好看的計劃或方案，執行起來，不是變質，就弄壞了。所以我以為今天政治上談改革，人事第一，制度方案等還在其次。假使人事依然，任你制度方案如何改變花樣，也等於換湯不換藥。歸結一句話：人才問題的嚴重，是今日政治上的主要　結！</p>
<p>然而“十室之邑，必有忠信”，國家固非無人才，卻要看所以培才，用才，遇才之道究竟是怎樣。那我們可以說：眼前的現象，是在大規模地浪費人才，糟塌人才！國家辦了幾十年的教育，濟濟多士，人才輩出，但都是慘淡辛苦的結晶，而我們今天索馬里看到對人才大規模的浪費和糟塌，這是一個多么痛心的現象？</p>
<p>第一，在培養人才方面，我們就發現教育方式的錯誤。因為培養人才即是為了國家需要，那么，國家對某部門專業究竟需要培養多少人才，對某種個人究竟須施以某種適當的專業訓練，一般地說，都應該有正確的計劃和合理的指導，以達成人才之量與質的均衡發展。而尤其是后者，即關於職業選擇的指導一點，我們認為是培養人才的先決條件。歐美最進步的學制，對於一個投考專門學校的學生，必須先就個性心理，智能和學業等各方面的測驗，以決定其擇業受教最適合的標準，這和我國古代的“因材施教”，用意正同。可是我們辦教育的對這一點太忽略了。專業的選擇，只憑學習者主觀的愿意，或環境的偶然的機會。我們根本沒有良好的對於職業選擇上的負責指導，使就學者達到個性能力充分的發展，這樣已不知埋沒了多少學習的天才！至學術自由研究空氣的缺乏，一般設備和實物教材的簡陋，教學方式的機械死板，與夫教育和現實生活的脫節等等，無疑的都是人才培養上嚴重的缺點。但學校按照規定模型把名式“人才”一批批地制造出來，自算已盡了教育的責任，而畢業生拿到一紙文憑，也算有向社會討飯的工具了。我們應該鄭重指出：這種對於人才的粗制濫造，實際上正是斷丧人才的起點！</p>
<p>第二，由於上述種種，再加以社會生產事業的落后，整個政治的不上軌道，各方用人重關系而不重人才的惡習，於是畢業即失業，也就成了極自然的現象，現在一般人都知道注意理工　　，當局也竭力提倡，而理工農醫畢業生的失業，并不較他科為少。倘無人事關系的憑藉，任你本事齊天，也祗好無立錐之地，即幸而混得一官半職，也往往是學非所用，用非所學，例如學　業的當店員，學機械的辦稅務，已為社會所習見不怪。我們常聽見關於“專家政治”和“效率政治”的提倡，而人才分配如此的不當，專家拒之門外，效率每況愈下，可是各方，又時有“人人找事事事無人”之　。益今日人才不是荒廢，就是亂插，國家用人，早已形成無政府狀態。這樣，政治又安得而不糟？社會又安得而不亂？（未完）</p>

<p>〔新亞社漢城廿七日電〕消息靈通人士稱：「蘇聯突然提出美蘇兩佔領軍同時撤出鮮之提</p>
<p>議，願係對美國將朝鮮問題提議列入聯合國大會議程之一種對抗行為。倘美蘇兩國實行撇退朝</p>
<p>鮮駐軍，則朝鮮局勢將更見混亂，蓋蘇聯在北轅已訓練共產軍約二十萬人，並已建立共產主議</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕法商水電公司全部職工二千七百餘人，於昨日下午一時二十分起全體怠工。法商紅色</p>
<p>公共汽車暨各級電車一律進廠停駛，發電與自來水部份百餘工人則仍維持工作。社會局間訊派員前</p>
<p>往勸導復工無效。全體工人齊集處家　該工會辦公業及廣場內，迄晚未獲解決。</p>
<p>此次工潮起因在於勞資間經年累月所績各縣案，勞方企團趁此澈底解決。勞方提出要求六項：</p>
<p>職員加薪等級請公司明確規定標準。（工人部份已於去年年底由社局調解解決。）　修訂車務服務</p>
<p>章程。　舉辦福利事業：甲，員工家屬醫院。乙，員工宿舍。丙，教育經費。在未舉辦前每月每人</p>
<p>補貼底數十五元。　改善工人子弟學校設備。　不請假升工每月二天。　中秋節借款每人五十萬元</p>
<p>，分期扣還。勞方幷限公司當局，於十二時前答復。至下午一時許，公司並未答覆，所有法商各路</p>
<p>電車及紅色公共汽車，遂陸續回廠罷工。</p>
<p>社局曾令該工會推派代表至社會局談判，但該工會負責人並未前往。</p>
<p>該公司產業工會於下午四時許在工會塲上舉行臨時大會時，社會局聞訊，派視察朱承浩前往，向</p>
<p>場上職工發表意見三項：　職工等此舉事先並未呈報社局。　所提各項問題，亟應依法解。</p>
<p>立即恢復交通。但職工等並未服從勸導。</p>
<p>英商電車一度被阻攔</p>
<p>法商電車怠工後，有不明身份者數十人，於南京路</p>
<p>一帶，向英商一二路電車攔阻，自稱係奉英商電車</p>
<p>工會理事長仇長江之命，為　應法商職工起見，勒</p>
<p>令停駛。致一二路各車，被阻者達十餘輛。但英商電車工會則專實上並未派員攔阻。</p>
<p>又據社會局昨晚發表消息：關於本日法商電車工人突然能工事件，主管當局已查明工人此次所</p>
<p>提谷項條件，毫無理由，且限期迫促，形同要挾，已闞令該工轉會　全體工人，立即復工，否則以</p>
<p>自動退職論，准由公司即予開革。如該工會無法控制，即予勒令解散，另行派員整理。同時英商各</p>
<p>路電車方面，昨有人冒用工會名義四出强行攔阻車輛之行駛，並已由軍　機關予以拘捕，以維護公</p>
<p>衆交通云。</p>
<h3>未經仲裁即罷工顯係違反動員令　市長社會局長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於法商水電公司</p>
<p>工人罷工事件，與市長昨日下午</p>
<p>偕社曾局局長吳開先臨時沼集各</p>
<p>報記者發表談話稱：法商水電公</p>
<p>司工人要求增加薪水十五元，並</p>
<p>提高等級，此顯係提高底薪，提</p>
<p>高底薪乃違反中央明令。况彼等</p>
<p>米經伸裁手續即行罷工，並限公</p>
<p>司當局於中午十二時前答覆，以</p>
<p>上種種行爲，不但達反勞工法，</p>
<p>且違反政府總動員令。此事恐與</p>
<p>上海電力公司開除共黨工人有關</p>
<p>，故已令飭有關方面嚴査，對其</p>
<p>中優秀工人准予復工，不良份子</p>
<p>決予制裁。吳市長又稱，英商電</p>
<p>車公司工人本身並不願罷工，而</p>
<p>被不良份子假用工會名義加以煽</p>
<p>動，同時該公司電車行駛時被奸</p>
<p>人攔阻，故已令警察局嚴密注意</p>
<p>，一經發現，立即逮捕。現英商</p>
<p>電車公司工人已有一部份復工。</p>
<p>市長並提及此次在當通印刷所</p>
<p>逮捕共匪活動份子案，謂現已逮</p>
<p>捕十三人，另有自首者一人，尙</p>
<p>有十五人在逃。昨日水電公司工</p>
<p>人罷工案，可能係該批在逃之共</p>
<p>匪所威動，市府決予嚴辦。</p>
<p>吳開先局長補充吿記者稱，法</p>
<p>商水電公司工人罷工事先並未向</p>
<p>社會局報吿，事後亦未報吿社局</p>
<p>聞訊後派人前往調査，會向工人</p>
<p>警吿不得有罷工行爲·而工人竟</p>
<p>不顧法令。下午三時工會開會，</p>
<p>社局派朱承浩出席並再度向彼等</p>
<p>警吿立刻恢復工作。責任應由工</p>
<p>會負祖。據朱氏報吿，工會代表</p>
<p>責問社局「為何要解散工會」，</p>
<p>而事實上社局並無解散工會，顯</p>
<p>係受人挑撥云云。</p>

<h3>行局員工要求已獲部份解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行一局員工絕食</p>
<p>事，已暫吿段落。行局當局對員</p>
<p>工所提四項要求，除允暫借薪津</p>

<h3>九月份生活指數發表</h3>
<p>工人：三四，四〇〇倍　職工：三〇，八〇〇倍</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市九月份生活指數，業經市府研究室編製</p>
<p>完竣，於昨日發表。工人生活總指數爲三萬四千四百倍，</p>
<p>計較上月份漲百分之十一，職員生活總指數三萬零八百倍</p>
<p>，計較上月份漲百分之十五。其分類指數如下：</p>
<p>工會所編指數相似</p>
<p>上海市生活費指數編製審議委員會，</p>
<p>於昨日上午十時，在市府舉行第五次會</p>
<p>議，由統計長張宗孟主席，報吿本月份</p>
<p>物價，皆普遍上漲，工人指數較職員少漲之原因，爲米價</p>
<p>粳米比秈米漲多，工人用秈米，且有配米。魚漲一三成不</p>
<p>等，菜蔬價跌，油鹽糖上漲，有配給，煤球漲五成，但工</p>
<p>人有配給煤。布疋上中旬平平，下旬漲，故影響不大。職</p>
<p>員因自來水及電影漲價，米煤無配給，故指數較高。張氏</p>
<p>對此項總工會目動出發調查編製生活指數與市府發表者相</p>
<p>似，至爲快慰。旋由總工會理事長水祥雲，理事章祝三報</p>
<p>吿實地分區調査經過，與市府不謀而合，故工界可絕對信</p>
<p>任。</p>

<h3>團圞節近往事如煙　看守所羈押漢奸家屬紛紛餽月餅</h3>
<p>〔本</p>
<p>報訊〕</p>
<p>因中秋</p>
<p>佳節即</p>
<p>屆，上海監獄高院看守所羈押之巨奸家屬紛</p>
<p>紛向監所送物，其中以應時月餅爲多，如蔡</p>

<p>蘇式，粵式，形形式式，大三元，冠生園,</p>
<p>杏花樓·老大房等應有盡有。惟因日前檢査</p>
<p>監房時，曾於某巨奸監房中抄出洋酒，深恐再有同樣情形，故檢</p>
<p>查時特別嚴格，此項月餅送入因房後，巨奸於鐵窗中啖月餅，望</p>
<p>外一輪皓月，當有往事如烟之感。</p>

<h3>漢奸趣案真假朱紀　辛亥革命同志會會員姓名相同被牽涉密吿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊</p>
<p>〕江蘇高院</p>
<p>受理朱紀漢</p>
<p>奸一案，因被吿所在不明，業經通緝在案，茲有辛</p>
<p>亥革命同志會其函該院，聲稱該會有一同志，亦名</p>
<p>朱紀，係安徽休寗人，現年六十一歲，未知與被通</p>
<p>緝之朱紀，年齡籍貫是否相同，請求査復。經高院</p>
<p>檢查漢奸朱紀起訴書所載，係浙江寗波人。現年四十，與該會所</p>
<p>述者不同。事有巧合，同時又有沈又新者，投函密告該院，謂朱</p>
<p>紀年近五旬，面龐長方，因眉上有一痣·常戴銅盆帽，以資遮蓋</p>
<p>，並以辛亥革命同志會名義爲掩護，請高院核查該朱紀會否任僞</p>
<p>「奉賢縣長」一及偽「上海特別市奉賢區署長」等職。</p>
<p>高院接此二函，以眞相難明，</p>
<p>未知事實何在，而辛亥革命同志</p>
<p>會之朱紀又居上海，逐囑託本市</p>
<p>地院代訊。昨日下午二時開庭，</p>
<p>由黃光鈺推事升座傳訊，詢六十</p>
<p>一歲之朱紀曾在奉賢做過事否，</p>
<p>答稱：「沒有做過事，我見報後</p>
<p>本想向蘇高院聲明，但一想世上</p>
<p>同名同姓的人很多，如與上海市</p>
<p>長吳國楨同名的就有十四人之多</p>
<p>，因此作罷，抗戰時我未去過奉</p>
<p>賢」。庭上間其抗戰時在和地方</p>
<p>，答稱在第十戰區，復詢彼職沈</p>
<p>又新否，答不認職。此一眉上無</p>
<p>痣之朱紀旋謂「我是辛亥革命同</p>
<p>志會發起人之一，黃花崗起義時</p>
<p>即參加革命胡，並未做過什麼區</p>
<p>長」。繼由辛亥革命同志會周鼎</p>
<p>三向庭上證述「該會會有公函到」</p>
<p>高院請求查復，但今日這個朱紀</p>
<p>，並非蘇高院所要的那個漢奸朱</p>
<p>紀，若這個朱紀是那個朱紀，則</p>
<p>我們也不會寫信辯白了」。</p>
<h3>聯合電廠合約草案參議大會決定保留　整理各參議員意見轉送兩部硏究</h3>
<p>〔本報</p>
<p>訊〕市參</p>
<p>議會昨日</p>
<p>下午舉行</p>
<p>第六次會</p>
<p>議討淪提</p>
<p>案二件，</p>
<p>對於組織</p>
<p>聯合電力</p>
<p>公司一案</p>
<p>，討論歷</p>
<p>三小時之</p>
<p>久，始一</p>
<p>致決定保</p>
<p>留至下次</p>
<p>大會時討</p>
<p>論。</p>
<p>關於組</p>
<p>織聯合電</p>
<p>力公司案</p>
<p>，前由市長將商定之合約草案提謂參</p>
<p>會討論，昨日上午公用，法規二委員</p>
<p>會特舉行聯席會議商討合約草案，對</p>
<p>該草案內第十三，十五及二十四條加</p>
<p>以修正。</p>
<p>下午大會討論合約草案，公用局趙</p>
<p>局長曾珏首先說明，略謂：本人認爲</p>
<p>此案在本次大會中係一最重要之議案</p>
<p>·聯合電廠之設立將決定今後本市經</p>
<p>濟之發展。聯合電力公司擬由閘北，</p>
<p>華商。浦東。杭州等電氣股份有限公</p>
<p>司，上海滬西電力公司，上海電力公</p>
<p>司等共同組織，係一中美企業之合作</p>
<p>機構。目前暫未邀法商電力公司參加</p>
<p>，因其在淪陷期內·並未被敵侵佔，</p>
<p>不能承受日本賠償電機。要旨在於合</p>
<p>組後求成本减低而可使上海市民得到</p>
<p>廉價電力。該公司可向美商借款二千</p>
<p>萬美元，且可在很長時期內償還。但</p>
<p>對於草案中第十三條第三行「本契約</p>
<p>授權與國際法院院長」一句，誠如馬</p>
<p>參議負君碩所稱，「聯合常力公司乃</p>
<p>爲一中國法人，應遵守中國法律，不</p>
<p>應授權國際法院院長」一點，本人亦</p>
<p>頗同意。現業經公用法規兩委員會修</p>
<p>正，於此句下增加「於征得駐院中國</p>
<p>籍法官及美國籍法官之同寭後，指定</p>
<p>一仲裁人」。</p>
<p>認為喪權辱國</p>
<p>參議員黃</p>
<p>炳權首表示</p>
<p>贊同　組聯合電力公司，部永生參議</p>
<p>員首先表示反對，認爲此項電力公司</p>
<p>純以私人營利爲目的，在合組以後，</p>
<p>使外國人有一機會將全部電力公司併</p>
<p>吞，故請保留此案，緩訂合約。費樹</p>
<p>聲繼謂，此種合約訂立後，實有喪失</p>
<p>我主權之處，猶如合約第十三條中所</p>
<p>謂「授權與國際法院院長」，實對我</p>
<p>本國法律毫不尊重。我國人辦企業，</p>
<p>數十年來受外人資本之束縛，今方稍</p>
<p>得解放，嗣後自不應再受外資束縛。</p>
<p>張志韓認爲合約條文，尤其如第十三</p>
<p>條，簡直「喪權」而且「辱國」。主</p>
<p>張保留，不予討論，請市府先送立法</p>
<p>院研究。</p>
<p>解釋誤會三點</p>
<p>李開第參</p>
<p>議員解釋各</p>
<p>參議員之誤會稱：　聯合電力公司乃</p>
<p>由市政府召集外人議定，本非由外人</p>
<p>發動組織，故不能謂為外人想併吞。</p>
<p>解決電荒在目前非靠外匯不可。</p>
<p>契約若不受中國公司法令之管制，方</p>
<p>算是喪權辱國，此草約規定應受中國</p>
<p>公司法令之限制，故不能算喪權辱國</p>
<p>。朱文德亦謂，此草約初看時不妥，</p>
<p>細加硏究後，並無不妥。長好請中央</p>
<p>去硏究，若找不川喪權辱國之點者，</p>
<p>則我們可以接受。但政府能自力更生</p>
<p>才是最好辦法。李文杰亦表示此草約</p>
<p>並無下妥。蓋一法人之組織，若解散</p>
<p>或改組，必須有四分之三之股東同意</p>
<p>，現美人投資股份不到百分之五十，</p>
<p>美人實並無權力控制股權。此事項相</p>
<p>當合算。同時，其中亦找不出喪權辱</p>
<p>國之處，但爲鄭重考慮起見，請延至</p>
<p>下次大會討論。</p>
<p>希望鄭重考慮</p>
<p>路式導稱</p>
<p>，拿起了這</p>
<p>份草案，就提心吊胆，把如此重要之</p>
<p>一機構，交付與一不知有無把握之組</p>
<p>織辦理三十三年，實在不能放心。故</p>
<p>希望鄭重考慮，先請專家硏究後再討</p>
<p>論。姜懐素亦不贊成，認爲八年抗戰</p>
<p>好容易取消不平等條約，現復有此種</p>
<p>契約出現。同時，一國地方上之事件</p>
<p>，夢開成國際問題，向國際法院請求</p>
<p>裁判，此種國家還成何國家？王先靑</p>
<p>說草案內非但沒有而且「一點」也沒</p>
<p>喪權辱國之處，我國人與外商合辦企</p>
<p>業並非遠反國策。而陶百川則堅稱確</p>
<p>有喪權辱國者，渠鄭重提請保留到下</p>
<p>次大會討論，切勿爲了拖延三個月而</p>
<p>貿然簽下一三十三年之契約。</p>
<p>結果詹文滸提出二具體意見：　可</p>
<p>否請將英文原稿再交參議員參考。</p>
<p>由參議會繼續研究，並請我國傎正之</p>
<p>法律專家或前輩如王寵惠等就一同硏</p>
<p>究。</p>
<p>市長發表意見</p>
<p>吳市長此</p>
<p>時發表意見</p>
<p>謂，自力更生固非常贊成，但以中國</p>
<p>事實來看·最近二三十年中建設事業</p>
<p>非靠外資不可渠列舉美國在第一次</p>
<p>大戰前都市建設事業都由英國投資。</p>
<p>現在外資並未利用我們，而係我們利</p>
<p>用外資，這不能算是喪權辱國，反可</p>
<p>稱盡忠國家。此外，當英國投資美國</p>
<p>時有許多問題發生後，亦由國際法院</p>
<p>公斷者，故建議爲不使吸收外資受到</p>
<p>打擊起見，一方面照程序送行政院交</p>
<p>外交部硏究是否喪權辱國，另就方面</p>
<p>再由參議會硏究俾有充分時間考慮。</p>
<p>陶百川參議員聞言後，表示地方政府</p>
<p>對一議案在地方立法機關未議決前，</p>
<p>不應先送到行政院去。市長常覺陶參</p>
<p>議員意見很對，改謂一方面咨請經濟</p>
<p>部外交部硏究。</p>
<h3>下次大會再予討惀</h3>
<p>最後出議長歸納各種</p>
<p>意見：　將此次大會討</p>
<p>論時各參議員之意見，</p>
<p>全部紀錄，如有不詳，</p>
<p>可請各參議員書面補充</p>
<p>交秘書處。　將上項紀</p>

<p>三向庭上證述「該會曾有公函到</p>
<p>高院請求査復，但今日這個朱紀</p>
<p>，並非蘇高院所要的那個漢奸朱</p>
<p>紀，若這個朱紀是那個朱紀，則</p>
<p>我們也不會寫信去辯白了」。</p>

<p>）曾於本年七七之夕，夥同情夫張光烈，友張念椿，特槍搶刧會</p>

<p>氣象合消息此次天氣之突然</p>

<h3>合肥邊緣虛驚一場</h3>
<p>桃溪鎮一役殲匪軍兩營</p>
<p>由於合肥在戰略</p>
<p>上居於重要地位·</p>
<p>當匪軍佔領六安舒</p>
<p>城的期內·便由南</p>
<p>及西南兩面向合肥</p>
<p>積活動，一直搞</p>
<p>到距合肥五十華里</p>
<p>的近圍·當時·合</p>
<p>肥守城兵力是綽有</p>
<p>餘裕，但出擎則在軍事上近於驚</p>
<p>險。匪軍進入安徽，人數幾多，</p>
<p>一直還是一個謎·據軍事方面估</p>
<p>計，總在六七萬人之請。直到國</p>
<p>軍×××師一部到達合肥，××</p>
<p>×師接着全部開到，才由南及西</p>
<p>南兩面出擊，匪軍望風披靡，桃</p>
<p>溪鎭一役，被殲者達兩營之多。</p>
<p>各機關奉令採應變措施</p>
<p>六安棄守消息，</p>
<p>傳到合肥的時候，</p>
<p>省政府各機關開始</p>
<p>應變的措施了·每</p>
<p>個職員領薪兩月，</p>
<p>重要公文裝箱，主</p>
<p>席李品仙手令各機</p>
<p>關加緊辦公，儲備</p>
<p>糧草，趕築城防工</p>
<p>事，這些原是應該且是必需的，</p>
<p>但「敏感」的人們認爲情形嚴軍</p>
<p>了，人嚇人，任何謠言郡沒有人</p>
<p>判斷眞假而被迅速流傳着，街上</p>
<p>行人每張臉上都表現倉惶神色，</p>
<p>黃包車夫挑夫一時身價十倍，只</p>
<p>許張嘴要錢，毋要開口還價，而</p>
<p>那些無法可走決定留在合肥的人</p>
<p>，儲存米草·於是米價打破卅萬</p>
<p>大關，特別是柴草，最高呌價每</p>
<p>担十一萬，保安司令部出示佈吿</p>
<p>，嚴禁造請或抬高物價。</p>
<p>箱籠在回流人心趨安定</p>
<p>直到十三日下午</p>
<p>克復桃溪鎭·並解</p>
<p>到六十個俘虜，又</p>
<p>有國軍到西南鄉搜</p>
<p>索化整爲零的散匪</p>
<p>，合肥人心才安定</p>
<p>下來，到今天，箱</p>
<p>子行李漸漸在回流</p>
<p>，人們對於大街小</p>
<p>巷的軍事工事，也不似以前那麼</p>
<p>觸目驚心了。居安思危，合肥人</p>
<p>應該保持鎮靜，並提高警覺。</p>
<h3>收復舒城</h3>
<p>記者廿一日</p>
<p>乘車到距離合</p>
<p>肥七十公里剛</p>
<p>從匪軍手中收</p>
<p>復的舒城，作三小時的扣留。進了城，好多商店還沒開門，</p>
<p>街上行人稀疏如晨星，城東北角一座高塔，靜靜地聳立在秋</p>
<p>陽中，景况顯得妻凉萬分。</p>
<p>匪軍到舒城是七號拂曉，除了</p>
<p>機關來得及撒走外，許多老百姓</p>
<p>還在夢中，醒來方知一切都變了</p>
<p>，變成國匪的世界！</p>
<p>匪佔領縣城後，就派了一個山</p>
<p>東人趙甫儉·出任僞縣長，據說</p>
<p>這個姓趙的·在一月前·就化裝</p>
<p>住在舒城「候缺」了，「上任」</p>
<p>後，召集來不及逃掉的人開會，</p>
<p>鬼話連天一面假仁假義</p>
<p>不擾人民，一</p>
<p>面抽調二千人去攻桃溪鎭，然而</p>
<p>狐狸尾巴遮掩不住的，搖身一變</p>
<p>，拿出猙獰面目，向地方勒索了</p>
<p>，開口一億五千萬，在暴力的壓</p>
<p>迫下誰敢還價，同時對於較有衣</p>
<p>食的人家·便藉口調査戶口，挨</p>
<p>次搜査，姦，搶，較抗戰時的日</p>
<p>本人更厲害，先後十一天中，舒</p>
<p>城財物搜刮一空。</p>
<p>皖省府主席李品仙</p>
<p>〔本報合肥廿三日航訊〕這次匪軍劉伯</p>
<p>誠部由豫南流竄到安徽，二十天中，曾先</p>
<p>後闖進過十個縣城，有五百萬人民遭受了</p>
<p>直接災害。現在皖中皖西軍要縣城次第收</p>
<p>復，匪軍竄勁的高潮似成過去，然而，匪</p>
<p>軍避免攻堅·即在有路可逃時，也不敢與</p>
<p>國軍接觸，它的主力還未曾被殲·正在大</p>
<p>別山茍延殘喘。</p>
<p>第八綏區司令夏威</p>
<p>一個老年人吿訴記者·匪軍在</p>
<p>舒城宣傳，是大家有飯吃，但是</p>
<p>把舒城擄刦一空·僅是它們有飯</p>
<p>吃，老百姓那有飯吃呢？在淪陷</p>
<p>期間，老百姓想望國軍，有如大</p>
<p>旱之瞾雲霓，而匪軍在城內，</p>
<p>製造謠言說它們軍隊已</p>
<p>到合肥城下，</p>
<p>又說合肥南門城牆倒了卅多丈，</p>
<p>又說合肥國軍撤退了，弄得老百</p>
<p>姓撲朔迷離，不知幾時才重見天</p>
<p>日！由桃溪鎭下來了許多傷兵，</p>
<p>才知道匪軍吃了虧，暗暗歡喜。</p>
<p>遇到舒城保護大隊一位軍官，</p>
<p>他曾協助國軍作戰的，據說，匪</p>
<p>軍到舒城有五千多人，但是裝備</p>
<p>很壊，尤其缺乏彈藥，可惜</p>
<p>地方武力太差，保警隊有一座大炮，</p>
<p>連發十三彈都打不出去，第十四</p>
<p>顆彈打出了半里路，却未爆炸，</p>
<p>步槍也多沒有刺刀。地方武力之</p>
<p>亟需充實，可謂爲顯而易見的事</p>
<p>實。</p>
<p>現在×××師師部駐在舒城，</p>
<p>記者訪問師長張世光時，是第三</p>
<p>次和他見面，因為彼此都受到時間</p>
<p>限制，僅作十分鐘的談話，他告</p>
<p>訴記者，在　南和劉伯誠部隊打</p>
<p>過，現在又在皖中交手，劉伯誠</p>
<p>經過歲千里逃竄，已經</p>
<p>精皮力竭但是它的主力</p>
<p>尚有殘剩，我</p>
<p>們必須搜尋它的主力而予以殲減</p>
<p>·它不攻堅，為要呌它遇堅，無</p>
<p>路可逃。張師長是湖南平江人，</p>
<p>他認識新聞界不少朋友。</p>
<p>舒合公路上，自　　以迄舒城</p>
<p>，公路和電綫多被破壊，而院公</p>
<p>路局和交通部合肥電價局迅速修</p>

<p>春秋二沈書畫展引  潘伯鷹　　吳興沈尹默監察與其賢宗邁士先生，將於九月二十七日至十月一日陳其畫書於中國　苑，以訊海上君子。先數日二公以此見告，敬綴小文，以爲之引。　　沈監察書名之盛無待於言。凡所以歸美於若人者，精鑒之士皆能言之，小人縱有所言，無以出其外。茲所欲紀者則監察論書之旨與學書之德也。監察論書之旨，余　有一篇，應沈子善敎授之請，載於其所刋行之畫學雜志。其語甚繁，而其要則歸於執筆之法在不背生理以盡毛穎之性。故其誠曰「不欺人，不自欺。」由是以探求執筆之理，而總無法於擫押鈎格抵之五字。行筆之方，在乎腕在提按。如是而已！然會於臨池之道具有甘苦者，則知此數言實金剛大法，於古今一切論　之語，當下直證，一掃而空者也。至於其學書之德，則所謂「即此是學」之意，吾於沈監察僅見之。當違難庸蜀之時，倭寇飛機日必投彈，監察書課亦“有常程。一日持所臨永興廟堂碑示余日「昨日大炸。我念所餘字無幾，不如努力終之。第卒以震撼過猛，案上　揚，不得不暫避矣。此後幅數行乃今日補完者。得毋意趣不類乎？」余笑日：「冀文敏作書一卷，時輟時續，動淹歲月。文敏坐太懶，公坐太勤耳。」鳴呼，此非所謂造次必於是顚沛必於是者乎！監察昔肄北碑最久。徐森玉先生每得新出土　本常以貽之，無不臨習數過至數十過者。蓋監察之於往古碑帖，不欲專師其長，更欲兼究其短，於以觀其變會其通。非若吾曹於性所不喜之書則不習也。故今所展覽者於北碑僅一二木存其跡而已。今所陳者於晋隋唐宋之　皆有臨本，而於　歐楷則，懐仁聖敎，東坡君謨山谷元章四家墨妙尤多玄悟。然此皆鑒賞家與收藏家所一　而知所爭相網羅之物，固無需余更著一語。獨承學之士欲知尹翁貞恒之德，不倦之心，於此人盡俱老之時一窺源流者，於此宜加意爲。　　邁土先生畫世家也。自其先世與其外家皆累代能畫。今世所行「傳硯虛畫集」即其堂上二老寄意之丹靑。其太夫人　韻珊，晚號玉册老人。余嘗在監察宅中見老人眞蹟，意境工妙欲游心於天水矣。老人又工指畫。是以邁翁亦傳母敎能指畫，今展覽會中有虬松一　。松葉婉勁蓋爪痕也。指　所動甚易，求婉則難。識者當喩吾言之不虛。顧邁翁乃不甚　其指畫，則其人好古　求謙以　牧有如此者。大氐邁翁之畫發乎畫卷，和以天倪，雖偶亦涉趣於石　而不以怪奇駭俗。此其所勝也。　　昔有明雲栖蓮池大師乃二公之先德。大師究極宗乘，而歸心惟在凈土。當時高憎智慧之大堂　之崇無若憨山者。無憨山於建池證讀之日：「以平等大悲攝化一切，……即萬行以彩一心，即　勞而見佛性者，古今除永明惟師一人而已。」其祟敬之若是。余讀蓮池警衆之文，自紀其至京師叩徧融師，　行再清。徧融吿之曰，「爾其守本分，一心念佛。」同行者聞之大笑，以爲此老生常談耳。千里遠來，爲求妙皆，乃如此不值半文乎。運池乃以為此正切近精實之語，事之終身。其文具在可覆按也。余此文所紀皆求平實。猥以　陋，故謹以蓮池故事爲證，庶乎舉沈氏古德之名言乃足　於今日觀二沈之畫　者。知　君子，　共參之！沈尹默的書法  自在　　字畫不只是記述傳達的符號，古人把它視爲人們風度的代表，幫有「字乃人的衣冠」的一句話，再從「人以字傳」和「人畫俱老」的兩句話想想，更加證明字書和人的關聯密切了。　　沈尹默的書法，有祟高的見解，豐富的修養，熟練的技巧，這是他的成功獨特之點，這是一般內行的人都公認這句話是切實而不是虛妄或過分的。在三十年前，他在北京大學任敎的時候，和劉三同訂潤例賣字，那時他的　　，已經是　　一時。其後清　帖　，凡是著名的碑帖，畫　的　　殆　，　帖的大成，而有自己的面目。對於寫字的綱要，如運筆，結構，骨力，韻味，氣勢各點，　不變化　會，豁然貫通，這是勤勤懇懇地四五十年的功夫，綫有這樣的成就，絕非　爾操　，　是臨池一年半載，略知橫直的能够比擬。　　他所寫的聖敎序，蘭亭序等，真是冠絕一時，當代無敵。我曾者到他所寫的這兩部帖字全文，精神飽滿，一筆不苟，一氣呵成，和原帖不相伯仲。這種驚心動魄的書法，不禁的使人大呼「腕中有鬼」，否則那能有此奇妙！　　再君他用「茅龍」寫的「貞觀」橫親和「眞逸」直輻，前者似是取法石門銘，後者是　鶴銘，蒼雄雄厚，力透紙背，而和他所寫魏碑，隋碑，晋帖等，另有一個面目，是知能者無所不能的了。　　章行　和沈的詩，如「舊京曾見麓山寺，　叟親批無數字；經君說破始恍然，書取神同貌可異」。這是和書道有關的。又說「當今於沈峨與氓，兩美相合情間　，把沈和于髯翁相比，其實以書論　，于沈兩人是各有領域的。章氏以前强調眞正讀書的人，年過六十，書法自然可觀。這自然是與修養有密切關係，所謂　卷氣，氣韻神逸，由此而來。絕非劍拔弩張的俗氣或是墨猪般字體的能够相提並論的了。玉樓春六闋  尹默　　一　　垂垂又見紅梅發，空醉剛圓杯底月；誰家　笛唱陽關？落盡霜花终未歇。江南驛路何超忽，欲寄一枝春好折；衛寒湖上記曾過，門巷皚皚深尺雪。　　二　　年年長作梅花化伴，花好未應和雪散；香寒意暖度春宵，銀炬高燒芳酒滿。尊前花下情何限，只惜　人無一半，明期有意好甫來，但得看花休恨晚。　　三　　新來天氣陰晴半，風物不殊情繾綣，梅花綻白雪微微，柳眼回青春淺淺。流光似水知難返，排日賞花人漸換；看伊和淚舉　　，淚滴空觴還自滿。　　四　　十年前事思　徧，春夢未醒人未遠；酒邊舞態蝶翩翻，花裏歌喉　宛轉。新詞一字情千萬，閑事　情無計　；春風江上目登樓，江水不如人意滿。　　五　　輕陰恰稱斟芳醞，薄醉閑慵何所恨；山桐初業雨絲絲，江柳未花風陣陣。池塘草綠添春韻，臨水依然青在　；心情可似　年時，　使相逢頻借問。　　六　　湖水無聲流漫漫，百二韶光過又半；錄楊仍向大隄垂，芳草不關人世換。多時未接鳶和燕，處處樓臺風雨　，淮應花底自開　，常恐酒添花已减。梅花瑤琴圖  費曉樓　　費丹旭，嘉興人，字于召，號曉樓。工寫照，形神酣肖；尤精仕女，兼山水花卉　　，雅潔可愛。偶作詩詞，亦淸麗可頌。道成間　　滬上，有聲於時，是曲盡　　儀態，筆意淸逸；數點梅花，一曲瑤琴，無限遐思飛逝於指間天外。堪稱藝林珍品。曉樓生於嘉慶七年，壬戍卒於道光三十年庚戌。享年四十有九。（上海市美術館　備處之百年畫展出品）（陳倚石識）玉樓春暖添春韻  孫福熙　　沈尹默先生書法展覽　　中國盡苑於二十七日起，舉行沈尹默沈邁士二先生書畫展覽會，茲光略述尹默師之書法。　　沈先生爲北京大大學名敎授，三十餘年前，凡代表北大的文字，均係先生所手書，故早已名震全國。先生治學旣勤，而自律又甚謹，十五歲已斐然超羣，五十年來不稍問　，如此硏究態度，實今日青年求學之良導師。光生爲學，堅忍精神，一貫不變，而研究態度，絕　門戶成見，二十五歲以後，晤以前筆之非、於是由「指實堂虛」及「掌堅腕平」　法從頭作起。三十歲以前習篆　，民國二年至十九年，編臨北朝碑，　學草書，以後凡唐代　家碑版，看　歐褚額徐李張范裴王柳沈，無不一一精心臨寫，專意點畫。從此歸納而得其共通法則。即用筆之道，千古一轍，惟　寫結體，隨時　人變化而已。　　中國藝術爲全球所推祟，中國認書畫同源，　法之　有藝術性，實爲全世界文字中之獨一無二者。所惜近來風尙淺陋，幾乎失傳，沈先生巾流砥柱，獨挽狂瀾，近雖未收徒課學，而友朋與青年學干，凡有所　益，必得先生諄諄解釋，其要　則　「提按」之法，一經示範實　，自可恍然大悟。所謂「橫來直受，直來橫受，」非親見不能了然於胸中。　　尹師書　中常有一　淑女士寫其硯墨展紙，邓先生詩詞中所見之「權弟」也。　　此次展覽出品中有「玉樓春」六闋，　彩色古箋上，正　歎畫法之超逸飛舞，　聞女士低語：「可請沈先生誦讀。」因即大膽請求，沈師果欣然吟唱：抑揚宛轉，從未曾聞。座中有喜有悲，多人落淚，其感人之深有如是者。　　出品中有臨聖敎序全篇，計六大幅、其墨色字體與疎密氣韻等一切，完全一氣呵成，絲毫不苟，無懈可擊。　　沈先生年近古稀，而形貌精神，雖四十以下者，亦未能及其　潤輕捷，此蓋得力於學問詩　之涵養。平生於古人書，不以愛憎有所抑揚棄取，但師其法度，隨其所見咸有領悟。又得見故宮所藏真　名帖，獲益尤多。近年更留意於前賢失誤處，謂非如此不能皿見其所長，故臨摹則必求逼真，而自運則務欲畫其在己，不悖時代，而能超乎時代，自來可稱一代書家者無不如此。故尹師常云：　　「明夫前賢法則，時代精神，個人特性，此三者缺一，即不成書。」　　常有人謂　竹均出於書，真草　簇諸法盡可用於簧竹中。沈先生近甚致力畫竹，藍先生以書體旣臨摹殆盡，反求書之新法於盡竹中也。　　沈光生所作詩詞均　筆工楷　寫，有五六集之多，均未付拌。此外書法論著亦未刋行。常此絕　危難時期，先生出其生平所書之半公開展覽，實可振聾發聵，指引靑年之前進，更　第二次展覽之早“實現，幷即刋佈其論　法之著作，以拯救無數彷徨之我男女老幼同胞。作家語錄  東方蒙露　　現在我們的作家們，是時時刻刻的都要寫作，沒有空閑，沒有多休息，所以我們必須學習不用靈感也能夠寫作　行。我們必須學到在高興時，　在任何情　裏都能夠工作的　種技術。　　　——左勤克</p>

<p>The National Army captured Chengwu this morning.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Yanzhou, 27th day of the month] The focus of the war in southwestern Luxi is gradually shifting south again. Chen Yi and</p>
<p>the remnants of his forces, claiming to be three columns, took advantage of gaps between Cao and</p>
<p>Shan counties to flee south again. One unit</p>
<p>has already fled to the area east and west of Wutun and Liukou, north of the Longhai Line on the border of Lu and Yu. The National Army is</p>
<p>dividing its forces to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Kaifeng, 27th day of the month] Military news: Chen Yi's 11th and 12th Columns, except for ten thousand men,</p>
<p>after fleeing south across the Longhai Railway yesterday from the areas of Ye,</p>
<p>Neihuang's Lu and Dangshan, advanced southward through Ningling and Suixian in a very flustered manner. Their vanguard arrived this afternoon in the area of Shiyuan, about ten miles north of Qixian,</p>
<p>and joined forces with Jin Shaoshan's and Wei Fenglou's units, showing signs of fleeing into southern Henan via Shenqiu and Zicheng.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, 27th day of the month] The scattered bandits in the area north of Cheng, on the southern bank of the Yellow River in Luxi, have now been completely eliminated. All ferry crossings on the southern bank of the Yellow River are now</p>
<p>garrisoned by the National Army. The connection between the northern bank and the bandits in southwestern Luxi has been completely severed. (War news from the Northeast, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces can be found on the second page.)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Leaves Beiping in the Rain to Personally Inspect Tanggu New Port; He Will Go to Jinan on His Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Beiping, 27th day of the month] Zhang Qun</p>
<p>left Beiping by special train for Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 27th, in the rain.</p>
<p>Xing Jiangxin, Director of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, Tan Bingxun, Director of the Beiping Public Works Bureau, and Sun Yueqi accompanied him.</p>
<p>Li Zongren, Sun Yunzhong, He Siyuan, and other officials, all went to the station to see him off. Before Zhang left Beiping,</p>
<p>he answered inquiries from Chinese and foreign reporters as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Regarding Dr. Sun Ke's statement and the reaction from</p>
<p>the United States, what are the Premier's thoughts?</p>
<p>Also, Dr. Sun Ke recently stated in an interview with the United Press that China's foreign policy may</p>
<p>change. Does this represent the views of the Chinese government, or is it entirely his personal opinion?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding our country's foreign policy, I</p>
<p>addressed this matter at a welcoming party at Yenching University.</p>
<p>That can serve as my answer to this question.</p>
<p>Question: What is the military and political situation in the Northeast?</p>
<p>Answer: I firmly believe that under Chief Commander Chen's leadership,</p>
<p>the military and political situation in the Northeast will soon improve.</p>
<p>Question: What is the Premier's opinion on the appointment of Soong Tzu-wen to preside over Guangdong,</p>
<p>and what are your thoughts on the reaction from the news media?</p>
<p>Answer: Appointing Soong Tzu-wen to preside over Guangdong is a case of having a Cantonese manage</p>
<p>Guangdong. Moreover, given his steadfast and responsible work ethic,</p>
<p>he will undoubtedly make many contributions to the province's administration. As for whether the news media's praise</p>
<p>or criticism is accurate, the facts will eventually prove this.</p>
<p>I do not intend to make any criticisms at this time.</p>
<p>Question: Is it rare for a Premier of the Executive Yuan to serve as a provincial</p>
<p>chairman? What are the inside reasons for former Premier Soong's appointment as chairman of Guangdong?</p>
<p>Answer: If you asked Mr. Soong to be the chairman of another province,</p>
<p>even if Soong had never served as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he might not have agreed. If the difficult situation in Guangdong Province was not as dire as it is after today's massive flood,</p>
<p>Mr. Soong would probably also have hesitated.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 27th day of the month] Premier Zhang Qun</p>
<p>arrived in Tanggu on the morning of the 27th to inspect the new port.</p>
<p>Reporters accompanied him. When he arrived in Tanggu in the afternoon, Zhang</p>
<p>got out of the car in the rain to review the honor guard. Xing Qixin, Director of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau,</p>
<p>Du Jianshi, Mayor of Tianjin, and others accompanied him on an inspection of the new port. Sun Yueqi,</p>
<p>Shi Zhiren, and Zhang's entourage also went along. He first</p>
<p>inspected the second wharf of the new port, looked out at the breakwater,</p>
<p>and then went to the first wharf to inspect the three warehouses under construction. He continued to the ship lock for inspection. Zhang asked</p>
<p>Director Xing in great detail, appearing very pleased. He then</p>
<p>summoned all the employees for a speech, stating roughly: The Tanggu New</p>
<p>Port is related to the prosperity of the entire north, and the government attaches great importance to it. Two thousand years ago, Li Bing of Tai'an, Guanxian, Sichuan,</p>
<p>built the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which could irrigate 3 million mu of farmland each year. To this day, the people of Sichuan still worship him</p>
<p>and repay his virtue. However, this largest water conservancy project in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>is still insignificant compared to the new port project. Currently, the country's expenditure is huge, and finances are</p>
<p>very difficult. I sincerely hope that all employees will work hard</p>
<p>on national construction. Zhang and others left Tanggu at 4:00 PM,</p>
<p>arriving in Tianjin at 5:30 PM. Zhang Boling, head of the local gentry from various circles,</p>
<p>and several hundred others welcomed him. After Zhang got out of the car,</p>
<p>he immediately visited Zhang Boling. At 7:00 PM, he attended a joint conference of the Tianjin Party, government, military, and civic groups,</p>
<p>followed by a joint public banquet hosted by various circles in Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Total Bank Deposits in the Country Exceed Two Trillion</h3>
<p>The government is seeking to absorb floating capital</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 27th day of the month] Premier Zhang</p>
<p>met with reporters in the car on his return from Tanggu to Tianjin</p>
<p>and answered questions. Regarding the recent trouble caused by floating capital,</p>
<p>manipulating prices, he said it was indeed an important</p>
<p>issue, giving the example that the total deposits of more than two hundred</p>
<p>banks across the country were only over two trillion.</p>
<p>The government is constantly seeking to absorb floating capital.</p>
<p>Regarding the government's emphasis on North China, Zhang</p>
<p>said: The government has placed the best quality and</p>
<p>largest number of troops in North China. In terms of economics,</p>
<p>most of the resources of the National Resources Commission are allocated to North China.</p>
<p>The best engineering talent is also mostly in the north.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of military affairs, politics, and personnel, there is sufficient</p>
<p>evidence to show the central government's emphasis on the north. Regarding rumors</p>
<p>of currency reform, he said that experts and scholars</p>
<p>were all conducting research and contributing opinions from time to time. The government is also paying close attention, but the current conditions are not yet</p>
<p>met. The government has not yet decided on a method, and it is impossible to say when it</p>
<p>can be implemented. Regarding supporting export</p>
<p>trade, Zhang said that the Joint Four Offices were unable to decide.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage: Four Supervisory Committee Members Carefully Draft Reports; Emphasis on Stockpiled Goods at Shanghai Wharf</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] The "Report on the Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage," which is highly valued by all parties,</p>
<p>is being drafted by Supervisors Wang Guanwu and He Hanwen. Wang and others are</p>
<p>being very careful with this investigation. After returning to Beijing, they discovered that some materials still needed to be supplemented. The Commission will send</p>
<p>an auditor to Shanghai again to collect information. The completion of the entire report will probably</p>
<p>still take time. Also, the most important thing that Wang and others are focusing on in this investigation is the goods purchased</p>
<p>with foreign exchange prepared by stockpilers at the wharf.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's emphasis on this matter is due to the evidence cited by their investigation. A member of</p>
<p>the Supervisory Committee participating in this investigation said: Some of the goods stockpiled at the wharf are products and</p>
<p>raw materials. These types of goods should be allowed to enter, but this should not be taken as a precedent. As for large</p>
<p>automobiles, if</p>
<p>their price exceeds the government-stipulated $1,200, they should not be allowed to enter.</p>
<p>However, it is also impossible to force them to be shipped back to their original exporting locations in Europe and the United States. The only</p>
<p>possibility is to smuggle them in through Hong Kong for sale at high prices. Rather than that, it would be better to find another</p>
<p>appropriate countermeasure, allow them to enter, and impose restrictions.</p>
<p>It has been decided to tighten loans, but it has been decided to</p>
<p>strongly support export trade. After the foreign exchange control measures were improved,</p>
<p>exports have already increased dramatically. When a reporter asked about the UNRRA suspending the shipment of relief supplies to North China, Zhang said</p>
<p>that the government had already decided on a method and was currently negotiating.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 26th day of the month] Premier Zhang,</p>
<p>due to his urgent need to return to Beijing to preside over the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday,</p>
<p>shortened his original itinerary. He will go to Tianjin on the 27th to</p>
<p>inspect the new port project and then conclude his trip to the north. On his return to Beijing,</p>
<p>he will go to Jinan to comfort the military and civilians of the war-torn city of Shandong and visit the newly recovered areas to</p>
<p>plan reconstruction and relief. His trip to Taiyuan has been</p>
<p>canceled, and a telegram has been sent to Yan Xishan, stating that he will visit Taiyuan when he inspects</p>
<p>the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Leaves a Deep Impression in Six Hours in Zhangyuan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 26th day of the month] Premier Zhang Qun</p>
<p>flew to Zhangjiakou by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 26th, accompanied by his staff.</p>
<p>Mayor He Siyuan of Beiping came along. Fu Zuoyi</p>
<p>led the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters and the heads of the provincial government to greet him at the airport. Zhang got off the plane amidst military music and reviewed the honor guard. Shan Chuanbian and Ren accompanied him into the city,</p>
<p>touring around. The people came to welcome him with cheers. At noon, he attended a welcome</p>
<p>rally of people from all walks of life and delivered a speech, first saying: The more I go to the border areas, the more I feel that my compatriots are respectable and lovable.</p>
<p>The spirit of vigor and vitality shown by the military and civilians of Zhangjiakou symbolizes a bright future for the country. Zhang praised General</p>
<p>Fu as the Great Wall of the North and felt deeply that Fu's method of governing the army and winning over the people was very effective, especially his sharing weal and woe with the soldiers,</p>
<p>getting close to the people, and being familiar with the sufferings of the people. The impression was very deep. Zhangjiakou has been recovered for less than a year, and</p>
<p>he was very impressed that all aspects could have such achievements. He also encouraged the military and civilians to make Zhangjiakou the great gate of northern national defense,</p>
<p>which the central government has always attached importance to, and should, under the leadership of Director Fu, concentrate their will, contribute to the country,</p>
<p>and complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Zhang was in good spirits, and his words were very sincere, which drew thunderous applause. Zhang</p>
<p>then met with reporters in a "dragon gate formation" style.</p>
<p>When answering questions about the different feelings from Nanjing to the north, he said: In North China and the Northeast, there are both foreign and domestic troubles, and the suffering of the people in deep water and hot fire is the deepest. The central government has always been concerned. The economic life in the north is difficult, and political facilities are simple, but the enthusiastic emotions shown by the people are all the more cherished.</p>
<p>The north is rich in resources and has a considerable scale of industry, which can be used as a base for national economic construction.</p>
<p>At present, attention should be paid to grasping the hearts of the people. Building the nation must first build the people. Only when the problem of building the people is solved can other construction be carried out. Comparing Beiping and Shanghai, he said:</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's largest metropolis, and its people are extravagant. Beiping is an ancient city with a history of five thousand years, and</p>
<p>its people are dispirited and in great need of changing their atmosphere. Regarding the issue of Mongolian banner autonomy, he expressed that promoting local autonomy</p>
<p>is the government's established policy. The Mongolian people have their own special</p>
<p>habits and traditions of political system. When formulating the autonomy law, attention should be paid to taking them into account. The implementation of autonomy should be prepared and have steps, and should not be hasty.</p>
<p>At present, the bandit troubles have not been quelled, and from the Northeast to the Northwest, everything is not stable. Under the goal of military first and safety first,</p>
<p>we should unite and work hard together to overcome the difficulties of the times, and in the spirit of Mongolian-Han cooperation, follow the procedures prescribed by the constitution</p>
<p>and gradually support Mongolian banner self-determination.</p>
<p>Regarding rectifying officialdom and eliminating corruption, he believed that it is necessary to rectify the root cause, improve treatment, and stabilize life. Various methods and organizations</p>
<p>should prevent opportunities for corruption. In addition to adopting stopgap measures such as reviewing and severely punishing, the government should also pay attention to the implementation of improving the lives of civil servants,</p>
<p>carefully selecting officials, strictly assessing rewards and punishments, and legally guaranteeing them, and hope to improve the public's spirit of law-abiding and shift the atmosphere so that</p>
<p>everyone understands and worships the law, so that corruption can be eradicated.</p>
<p>He finally said that he was very concerned about the frontier news industry and that the central government would provide effective support.</p>
<p>Although Zhang's visit lasted only a few hours, he was still able to chat with reporters for forty minutes, looking very happy. Zhang's visit, although only six</p>
<p>hours long, left a deep impression on the military and civilians, because Zhang was the first prominent politician to visit Zhangjiakou, and the military and civilians were filled with enthusiasm,</p>
<p>fully demonstrating the border people's sincere support for the government.</p>
<h3>Frequent Military Transport in the Southern Border of Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Gui Sui, 27th day of the month] Recently,</p>

<h3>Three Sets of Powerful Runway Lights to Be Shipped from the US to Shanghai Soon; Will Be Installed at Airports in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] According to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration,</p>
<p>three sets of powerful runway lights ordered from the United States will soon be shipped to Shanghai. These runway lights have been</p>
<p>widely used by the U.S. military since 1943. They can emit a very high luminous flux and can help aircraft take off and land safely</p>
<p>at night or during the day when "visibility" is poor. It is said that the three sets of equipment will be installed in</p>
<p>Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan as soon as they arrive. Once the equipment is completed,</p>

<p>held its eleventh meeting on the 27th. Chairman Zhang Lisheng first reported on the process of extending the voting</p>
<p>period for National Assembly delegates by one month and</p>
<p>requested ratification. He stated: [The important progress of the election of National Assembly delegates is based on reports from all parties.</p>
<p>The election offices in all provinces and cities are working hard to ensure that</p>
<p>they can be realized as scheduled. However, the reality shows that there is no way to proceed in parallel as scheduled.</p>
<p>In order to quickly come up with a remedy, there is ultimately no way to have both law and reality.</p>
<p>The only thing to do is to appropriately extend the originally scheduled voting dates for National Assembly delegates to November 21 to 23,</p>
<p>which is actually an extension of one month. Although it does not</p>
<p>conform to the regulations on the implementation preparation procedures,</p>
<p>it is even more serious in showing the solemnity of the National Assembly elections.</p>
<p>The above opinions were submitted to the National Government for approval at the State Council meeting this week in order to adapt to the situation and catch up</p>
<p>with the process. It has already been submitted to the National Government for a resolution by the State Council and requested ratification. It will be approved immediately.</p>
<p>The request for ratification was approved. At the meeting, the candidates for committee members of the district and county election offices in Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, Guizhou, Ningxia, Border Region, Anhui, Fujian,</p>

<h3>Wife of U.S. Consul General Talks About the Recent Situation in Dalian</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 27th day of the month] The wife of</p>
<p>the U.S. Consul General to Dalian, Mr. Pennington Goff, recently flew to Pyongyang on a Soviet military plane due to illness,</p>
<p>and then arrived in Seoul by train. She declared here today that Dalian is under the supervision of the Lu army and</p>
<p>is now managed by Chinese people who can speak Japanese. The important positions in the city</p>
<p>government are all filled by pro-Soviet people, but it has not been stated whether these Chinese people are communists.</p>
<p>The total population of Dalian is more than one million, and about 250,000 overseas Chinese have been sent back to their country.</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese people have also moved to areas controlled by the Chinese government, and the current number is far less than that.</p>
<p>The port is used exclusively by Soviet ships, with two to seven docking per week,</p>
<p>apparently traveling to Lushun or Vladivostok. Traffic on the Dalian-Shenyang railway has long been cut off,</p>
<p>and trains only run between Lushun and the Soviet military headquarters. American citizens are allowed to move freely in the city and</p>
<p>can purchase food, but local prices are very expensive due to inflation.</p>
<p>Communications between the U.S. consulates in Dalian and Vladivostok are also delayed by the Soviet military from time to time.</p>

<h3>Postal, Telecommunications, Railway, and Military Price Increase Plan; Ministry of Transportation Submits Four Principles to the Executive Yuan to Adjust Prices by District Based on Local Index Scores</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] The method of increasing the prices of public utilities such as postal, telecommunications, railway, and military services; according to</p>
<p>the plan submitted by the Ministry of Transportation to the Executive Yuan's provisional meeting on the 27th, the following four principles are proposed:</p>
<p>1. Price increases by district, adjusting the prices according to the different cost of living indices in various regions of the country.</p>
<p>2. Adjust prices according to costs. Currently, postal and telecommunications services are operating at a huge loss. If prices are increased according to costs, then</p>
<p>the postage for a regular letter must be increased to 2,500 yuan, and the price of telegrams and telephones must be doubled in order to balance revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>3. Take into account the burden on the people and make appropriate adjustments. The shortfall will still be subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>4. Maintain the old price and continue to be subsidized by the government. After deliberation, the decision was paid and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Sales of Foreign Luxury Goods: Regulations to be Examined by Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 27th] According to the provisions of the Outline of Measures for Implementing Thrift and Economy in Consumption, any goods prohibited from import will be confiscated by the government if found on the market two months after the promulgation of the outline. Based on this, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted "Measures for Combating the Sale of Prohibited Imported Goods," which were submitted to the Executive Yuan and, after discussion at the temporary Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th, were decided to be submitted for review. It is understood that: The prohibited imported goods referred to in the measures include foreign wines, foreign cigarettes, complete manicure sets, parts, powder compacts, dressing cases, perfumes, cosmetics, pure silk or rayon knitted threads and ribbons, pure silk or mixed thread cut velvet, and other various luxury goods, but goods with the same name are not included in the crackdown. These prohibited items are divided into two categories: A and B. Category A will be prohibited from sale nationwide simultaneously starting from New Year's Day of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], and Category B will be prohibited by government order at an appropriate time. These items will be confiscated and sealed by the relevant agencies. After the period for appealing the penalty expires, they will be sold off on a fixed schedule. Thirty percent of the proceeds will be used as rewards for those who report the smuggling and the officers who seize the goods. The remaining proceeds will be used for refugee relief. The identification of prohibited imported goods will be the responsibility of a Prohibited Imported Goods Identification Committee, convened by the competent authorities and composed of representatives from local chambers of commerce, trade associations, and relevant industry guilds.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 27th] Article 9 of the Measures for Import and Export Trade stipulates that importers shall not engage in procedures to pre-order goods from abroad without obtaining a permit. It has now been decided to amend this to read: "Importers shall not enter into contracts to purchase goods from abroad or ship goods from abroad before obtaining an import permit." This has been passed by the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 27th and will be promulgated and implemented. The original regulations were difficult to implement in view of the actual situation of import businesses. The current method of issuing import permits requires merchants to provide documentation of the goods they intend to purchase, otherwise the nature and price of the goods cannot be determined, and the reasonableness of the import application cannot be reviewed. For bulk commodities traded on a forward basis, such as cotton, it has become a commercial practice for merchants to order futures, and there is no need or necessity to prevent this. For bulk commodities supplied on a long-term basis, such as diesel, gasoline, and kerosene, shipping plans must be determined several months before shipment. If advance consultation and ordering and transportation procedures are not allowed, the sale of these essential materials may come to a standstill. For these reasons, the amendment was made.</p>

<h3>Zhang Yanting is Resting in Peace; Li Tingyu Accuses Zhang of Receiving Bribes; Military and Official Supervisory Group Will Investigate</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 27th] Former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Yanting has been accused by Li Tingyu, Chairman of the Tianjin Self-Government Promotion Association, of receiving bribes. A spokesperson for the Military and Official Supervisory Group announced today that the group received Li's letter of accusation in early September but has not yet investigated. The investigation conducted by Zhou Zishi in Tianjin was for time-sensitive cases, and the group was unable to formally commence work in Tianjin due to the lack of funds. It will investigate later. The spokesperson also confirmed that shortly after Zhang Yanting took office, Li accused him before Chairman Chiang. The Chairman ordered Li Zongren to investigate. Director Li declined because the matter concerned supervision and requested Li Sichong to handle it. Inspector Li went to Tianjin to meet with Li Tingyu and conducted extensive investigations but found no evidence. This time, Li filed the accusation in his own name but still failed to provide conclusive evidence. Zhang Yanting is now resting and recuperating in Beiping and has issued a statement in the newspaper, stating that he has requested the Supervisory Group to conduct a thorough investigation and that the plaintiff should provide evidence. According to Li Tingyu's statement, if the accusation is false, he is willing to accept the consequences. He also stated that he met with Zhang, Lu Zhonglin, and others regarding this matter.</p>

<h3>At the Kaifeng Press Conference, Cheng Qian Discusses Military Affairs; The Bandits' Infiltration of the Central Plains is Indeed a Good Opportunity for Individual Annihilation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Kaifeng office, 26th] Cheng Qian held a reception for reporters from Kaifeng and other cities in Henan Province at the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters at 10:00 a.m. today. Cheng first gave a general report on the military situation. According to him, Liu Bocheng's troops, who had infiltrated Henan from western Shandong two months ago in coordination with Chen Yi's westward advance, suffered heavy blows from the National Army. The Yellow River flooded, cutting off their escape route. They had no choice but to lead the remnants of 70,000 bandits south across the Longhai Railway into the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. They suffered heavy losses in the pursuit and interception by the National Army. Among them, the backbone troops of the 1st and 7th Columns have been routed and reorganized into independent columns. They are currently besieged by the National Army in the northern part of southern Anhui, and their number is less than 50,000, making them easy to annihilate. Chen Geng's troops, numbering 50,000 to 60,000, in western Henan were originally intended to support Liu Bocheng's troops. Although they crossed the river and captured Xin'an, Mianchi, Shanxian, Yanshi, Luoning, Yiyang, Songxian, Yiyang, Yitang, and other places, looting and killing, it was only a short-term harassment and can be easily pacified. Chen Yi's troops, numbering 40,000, in the border area of Henan and Shandong, have recently been active near Heze in support of the war in western Henan. The National Army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with these bandits. In short, the villagers of the Central Plains have suffered from the bandit's invasion south across the river, and their infiltration in separate groups is a good opportunity for the National Army to annihilate them individually. Regarding the election issue in Henan Province, he said that everything is being handled in accordance with the instructions of the central laws and regulations. When reporters asked how elections would be held in newly occupied and semi-occupied areas, he replied that it would be determined after receiving instructions from the central government.</p>

In the past, the quality of the police was poor and they could not shoulder the responsibility of building the police and building the country. The new police should have a new spirit, new academic skills, and moral cultivation. Every police officer should manage 10,000 people, influence society, and change the atmosphere, so that the foundation of society is safe, and there is hope for suppressing bandits and building the country. 3. The completion of the later revolution and the construction of a new China depend on the joint efforts of all the staff and students of the school to carry forward the spirit of benevolence and tolerance, so that we can build a new police force and accomplish our mission.</p>

<h3>The Rape and Murder of a Female Teacher in Wujiang; Five Main Culprits Executed in Beijing by Firing Squad; Spectators Packed the Streets, Cheering</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 27th] The five main culprits in the case of the rape and murder of female teacher Zou Yuee in Tongli Town, Wujiang, and the robbery of property, Liu Keming, Zhou Tianquan, Pu Yudan, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoxian, have been sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense and executed by firing squad at the Tianjiesi execution ground at 3:30 p.m. on the 27th. Spectators packed the streets, cheering. After this case occurred, local people were outraged, causing strikes and market closures. The highest authorities were also greatly angered and repeatedly ordered the military law authorities to thoroughly investigate and handle the case. In August of this year, all the criminals in the case were brought to the Military Law Department in Beijing by the Wujiang District Court for interrogation. After collecting evidence from various sources and repeated interrogations, the proposed judgment was reported to the Chairman. Among them, Peng and Zhang were originally sentenced to life imprisonment, but the verdict was changed to death after approval. The approval order for this case was issued to the Military Law Department on the morning of the 27th. Because the 28th was Sunday and the 29th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, the execution was carried out on the afternoon of the 27th. At about 3:10 p.m., the five criminals were taken out of prison. Seeing the heavily guarded gate and the surrounding photographers, their faces changed drastically and they sweated profusely, but they still tried to calm themselves. They were escorted into the military court. Judge Zhang Xiaosheng asked for their names, ages, and places of origin, and then stood up to announce the main text of the judgment.</p>
<p>The chief culprit, Liu Keming, asked the court to be exempted from being tied up, saying, "If you do wrong, you should of course be punished by the national law." Peng Hengda, who was younger, quickly said: He didn't quite understand why he was dying and asked the court to continue investigating the truth even after his death. The other three criminals remained silent. After the court allowed them to write their wills, they were escorted to a row of five wooden tables prepared outside the court. Peng had just sat down when he suddenly stood up and shouted, "Long live the Republic of China, long live Chairman Chiang!" After getting into the car, Peng and Liu suddenly shouted again that they wanted to write their wills. They were silent only after being tied to the car. The prisoners' special car arrived at Tianjiesi at 3:30 p.m. They were supported to the execution ground by soldiers on the left and right. Peng was in front, and the other four criminals stood in a row behind him, facing east. As they shouted slogans, five shots were fired simultaneously, and all five criminals fell to the ground. Cheers and shouts from the surrounding crowd rang out along with the gunshots. Later, because the criminals were not completely dead, three shots or two shots were added to each, and a maximum of five shots were added before they died.</p>

<h3>Political Reform and the Talent Problem (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Du Zuozhou</p>
<p>The call for political reform has recently resonated throughout the land. "Poverty leads to change, change leads to progress," and now we have indeed reached a critical point where change is imperative. However, when discussing political reform, one cannot help but first think of the issue of talent.</p>
<p>The principles of politics are inherently simple. "Those who gain talent prosper, those who lose talent perish." This cliché still holds true for China today, which has not yet embarked on the right track of the rule of law. While we do not advocate "rule by men" or promote a "government of good people," we also believe that heroic or impulsive political reforms are by no means the fundamental solution to today's political problems. However, we have a new perspective on the importance of talent: we believe that democracy, in a narrow sense, should be a political system where "everyone can give full play to their talents." Because political problems, in the final analysis, are always inseparable from human problems. The founding father Sun Yat-sen said, "Politics is the affair of the people, and managing the affairs of the people is politics." If these "people" are all incompetent, and those who "manage the affairs of the people" are not all like Zhuge Liang, then there is undoubtedly a need for talent. This is the minimum requirement for modern democracy; otherwise, so-called "democracy" will degenerate into "dictatorship" or "fooling the people."</p>
<p>The approach to talent varies from era to era. In feudal autocratic times, the focus was simply on passively seeking loyalty and obedience, with the main goal of preventing rebellion. Therefore, in addition to adopting a policy of "the people can be made to follow, but not to understand" for dealing with the masses, scholars were subjected to a cage-like policy centered on the imperial examinations, with the aim of "bringing all the heroes of the world into my control." In the eyes of feudal rulers, the best talent was essentially a slave, so there was naturally no talk of "everyone giving full play to their talents." In a democracy, the meaning of everyone giving full play to their talents is threefold: first, to cultivate talent, so that everyone can freely and fully develop their individuality and genius; second, to employ talent, so that talent has an outlet and each person can find their place; and third, to maintain talent, so that each person can settle into their position and express their ambitions. Solving the talent problem not only passively promotes political integrity and stability, but the complexity and specialization of modern politics make it impossible to succeed without specialized talent. Furthermore, the true spirit of democracy can only be realized when all those who "manage the affairs of the people" have the hope of freely and equally developing their talents and ambitions in politics.</p>
<p>First, consider the nature of politics itself: corruption and incompetence are generally criticized by public opinion. We do not need to wait for Wedemeyer's criticism; we have long recognized the need for "political and economic reform." But when it comes down to it, human factors always play a major role. A good system from Europe and America, when brought to China, often "changes its nature when transplanted north of the Huai River"; and any good-sounding plan or program, when implemented, either changes in quality or goes wrong. Therefore, I believe that when discussing reform in politics today, personnel is the most important factor, and systems and programs are secondary. If the personnel remains the same, no matter how the systems and programs change, it is like changing the soup but not the medicine. In short, the seriousness of the talent problem is the main problem in today's politics!</p>
<p>However, "in a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people." The country is not without talent, but it depends on how talent is cultivated, used, and treated. We can say that the current phenomenon is a large-scale waste of talent! The country has been running education for decades, producing many talented individuals, but they are all the result of arduous efforts. Today, we see a large-scale waste of talent, which is a heartbreaking phenomenon.</p>
<p>First, in terms of cultivating talent, we find errors in the educational methods. Because cultivating talent is for the needs of the country, the country should have correct plans and reasonable guidance on how much talent to cultivate in certain departments and professions, and what kind of appropriate professional training to give to certain individuals in order to achieve a balanced development of talent in terms of quantity and quality. Especially the latter, namely guidance on career selection, which we believe is a prerequisite for cultivating talent. The most advanced education systems in Europe and America require students applying to specialized schools to undergo tests in personality, psychology, intelligence, and academic performance to determine the most suitable standard for their career choice and education, which is the same intention as "teaching students according to their aptitude" in ancient China. However, we who run education have neglected this point too much. The choice of major depends only on the subjective willingness of the learner or the accidental opportunities of the environment. We simply do not have good and responsible guidance on career choices to enable students to fully develop their individual abilities. We do not know how much of their learning genius has been buried! The lack of academic freedom and research atmosphere, the general lack of equipment and teaching materials, the mechanical and rigid teaching methods, and the disconnection between education and real life are undoubtedly serious shortcomings in talent cultivation. But schools, according to the prescribed models, produce batches of "talents" in name only, considering that they have fulfilled their educational responsibilities, and graduates receive a diploma, which is considered a tool for begging for food from society. We should solemnly point out that this kind of crude and shoddy production of talent is actually the starting point for losing talent!</p>
<p>Second, due to the above reasons, coupled with the backwardness of social production, the entire political system being off track, and the bad habit of all parties valuing relationships over talent in employing people, it has become a very natural phenomenon that graduation means unemployment. Now everyone knows to pay attention to science and engineering, and the authorities are also trying their best to promote them, but the unemployment of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine graduates is no less than that of other subjects. Without the backing of personal relationships, no matter how great your skills, you will not have a place to stand. Even if you are lucky enough to get a position, it is often learning not being used for what it is, or using what is not learned. For example, those who studied business become shop assistants, and those who studied mechanics handle taxes, which has become a common sight in society. We often hear about the promotion of "expert politics" and "efficient politics," but the allocation of talent is so inappropriate, experts are turned away, and efficiency is deteriorating. However, all parties often lament the situation of "everyone looking for a job, but no one to do the job." Today, talent is either wasted or misplaced, and the country's employment has long been in a state of anarchy. In this way, how can politics not be bad? How can society not be chaotic?

<h3>Soviet Union Proposes Withdrawal of Troops from Korea, US Official Reaction Cold, Rhee Syngman Firmly Opposes, Believing It Would Lead to Civil War, Rumors of 200,000 North Korean Communist Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 26th] The Soviet Union's proposal that US and Soviet troops simultaneously withdraw from Korea next spring is seen by the US Foreign Office as a propaganda tactic to influence the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Korean issue. The Soviet Union does not want its proposal to be scrutinized. According to the 1945 Moscow Agreement, the Allied powers would administer Korea for five years before granting it full independence. The complete withdrawal of US and Soviet troops at this time would allow Korea to be controlled by the communists, who are well-organized in the Soviet-occupied zone.</p>
<p>[United Press Seoul, 27th] South Korean political leader Rhee Syngman declared today that if the Soviet Union's proposal that US and Soviet occupation forces simultaneously withdraw next spring were to be realized, civil war would inevitably break out in Korea, and the north would become a second Manchuria.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 27th] US Undersecretary of the Army Draper said today that, based on what he saw in Korea, it is very clear that the whole country needs an independent and unified democratic government. Korea is currently divided into two zones, with heavy industry in the north and agriculture and light industry in the south, and the south needs raw materials from the north, but because there is an armed border between them, they cannot communicate with each other. The United States wanted to unify Korea but was unsuccessful, so it submitted the issue to the United Nations, and the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw from Korea followed closely, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 27th] Well-informed sources said, "The Soviet Union's sudden proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet occupation forces from Korea is a countermeasure to the United States' proposal to include the Korean issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. If the US and the Soviet Union implement the withdrawal of troops stationed in Korea, the situation in Korea will become even more chaotic, as the Soviet Union has trained about 200,000 communist troops in the north and established a communist people's government, while South Korea has only about 50,000 police and security forces, and only a temporary legislative body politically."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 27th] US representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, Major General Brown, said today that the Soviet propaganda is false and mostly exaggerated. The Soviet representatives demanded that South Korea release the recently arrested conspirators and announced this to the world. We must know that the Soviet Union has no right to interfere in any of South Korea's measures.</p>
<h3>After Britain Announced its Palestine Policy, Both Arabs and Jews Expressed Skepticism, Jewish Representative Shertok Held a Long Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 27th broadcast; The British Foreign Office announced that once the United Nations General Assembly has made a decision on the Palestine issue, Britain will withdraw 100,000 troops from the Holy Land. Well-informed sources predict that this withdrawal may be a preliminary action, and all troops will be withdrawn within two months. The British government insists that the UN General Assembly must make a decision on the Palestine issue at this session and must not delay any further, but if the United Nations needs to establish international institutions and cannot do so in a short period of time, Britain may postpone the complete withdrawal of troops, but the time cannot exceed two months. The "Daily Mail" reported that the Soviet Union deliberately moved Jews from Eastern Europe to Palestine to make it difficult for the British and supplied the Jews with marks printed in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, disrupting the financial situation in the British and American zones of Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press Jerusalem, 26th]</p>
<p>British Colonial Secretary Creech Jones made a statement at the UN General Assembly</p>
<p>, willing to hand over the mandate of Palestine, which</p>
<p>both Jews and Arabs heard with</p>
<p>skepticism. Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, David Ben-Gurion, said that</p>
<p>the British statement did not specify when</p>
<p>it would withdraw from Palestine, only saying it would withdraw as soon as possible,</p>
<p>which is meaningless.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 26th] An Arab League spokesperson announced today: Britain's decision</p>
<p>to withdraw from Palestine as soon as possible</p>
<p>is supported by us, but we will oppose</p>
<p>United Nations institutions replacing</p>
<p>Britain's position and continuing to administer Palestine.</p>
<p>The Arab nation insists on its unwavering</p>
<p>position of unconditionally taking over Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 26th]</p>
<p>Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency and President of the Zionist Organization of America, Silver, and</p>
<p>Political Director of the Jewish Agency, Shertok,</p>
<p>visited Marshall today for an hour to</p>
<p>discuss the United States' attitude towards the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>Also, after British Colonial Secretary Creech Jones's statement in the UN General Assembly's Palestine Committee, the</p>

<p>26th]</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the Higher Arab Executive Committee of Palestine, Khalidi, when commenting on the speech of British Colonial Secretary Creech Jones in the UN General Assembly, put forward a five-point</p>
<p>plan, including the establishment of a Jewish-Arab transitional government</p>
<p>to tide over the transitional period after Britain's withdrawal from Palestine and before the independence of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>This transitional government would be composed of five Arabs</p>
<p>and two Jews from Palestine,</p>
<p>headed by a senior commissioner appointed by the UN institution</p>
<p>and a senior</p>
<p>deputy commissioner appointed by the Arab League.</p>
<h3>Polish Representative Harshly Criticizes Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 27th broadcast: Polish representative Lange,</p>
<p>attending the UN General Assembly,</p>
<p>criticized the Marshall Plan in the General Assembly today and advocated that the United Nations institutions be responsible for</p>
<p>assisting the economic recovery of Europe. Lange believes that the implementation of the Marshall Plan will</p>
<p>divide Europe into two, and economic prosperity, like peace, is indivisible. The Marshall</p>
<p>Plan cannot play a significant role because it separates the eastern and western parts of Europe, but what Europe needs</p>
<p>is mutual assistance between Eastern and Western Europe and mutual</p>
<p>adjustment of resources.</p>

<p>[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 26th]</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee continued to debate the</p>
<p>trusteeship issue of Southwest Africa. Soviet representative Stein said that</p>
<p>South Africa's refusal to submit a trusteeship agreement for Southwest Africa</p>
<p>is intended to annex the area. Syrian representative Aslan</p>
<p>suggested limiting the time for South Africa to submit a</p>
<p>trusteeship agreement for Southwest Africa. Other representatives also criticized</p>
<p>South Africa.</p>
<h3>After McNeil Criticized the Soviet Union, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Retorted, Also Accusing Dulles, Bullitt, and Others of Inciting War</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, 26th</p>
<p>] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Chief</p>
<p>Representative to the UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky (pictured), held a grand</p>
<p>press conference in this</p>
<p>Security Council meeting room, attended by about six hundred people.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky continued to criticize certain leading figures in the United States, accusing Republican</p>
<p>foreign policy expert Dulles and former US</p>
<p>diplomat Bullitt of being warmongers. He also pointed out that British Minister of State McNeil's remarks</p>
<p>were full of fabricated lies defaming the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky said: McNeil claims to be</p>
<p>an expert on Marxism, but unfortunately, when discussing the issue of warmongers,</p>
<p>McNeil suddenly lost his ability to speak.</p>
<p>The list of American warmongers released by Vyshinsky today</p>
<p>included two more people than the last time,</p>
<p>one being former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt and the other being</p>
<p>radio commentator Winchell. Vyshinsky pointed out that McNeil's remarks had three remarkable</p>
<p>characteristics: one was that he defended Churchill, one was</p>
<p>his accusation that Egypt was ungrateful to Britain, and one was</p>
<p>his theory of sovereignty. In addition to reporters, several diplomats were also present at today's reception.</p>
<p>McNeil was only present for five minutes, and he withdrew as soon as Vyshinsky</p>
<p>criticized him.</p>
<h3>Foreign Communist Journalists Allowed to Cover UN News</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 27th] The</p>
<p>government today allowed foreign communist journalists to come to the United States</p>
<p>to cover news of the United Nations General Assembly. A reporter from a certain</p>
<p>French communist newspaper has now been granted permission to report to his country</p>
<p>on the opening of the General Assembly, but must</p>
<p>return to Paris immediately at the end of the General Assembly. According to the Department of Justice</p>
<p>, this new policy is broader than the restrictions</p>
<p>on American journalists at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference,</p>
<p>and will not be used beyond the General Assembly. All</p>
<p>communist journalists entering the country must have a formal mission.</p>
<h3>United States Proposes to the United Nations General Assembly to Establish a Standing Committee to Balance and Handle International Disputes with the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 26th] The United States</p>
<p>today proposed a plan to establish a 55-nation Standing Committee, which</p>
<p>fully recognizes that the Security Council has the primary responsibility to take prompt and</p>
<p>effective action to maintain international peace and security. The main functions of the Standing Committee include:</p>
<p>*  Examining and reporting on situations deemed likely to hinder</p>
<p>the general welfare and friendly relations described under Article 14 of the Charter, or issues submitted to the General Assembly by the Security Council;</p>
<p>*  Examining and making recommendations on general principles of cooperation for maintaining international peace and security, and studying methods of promoting international cooperation and making recommendations;</p>
<p>*  Examining whether any issues require the convening of a special session of the General Assembly;</p>
<p>*  Presiding over investigations, appointing investigation committees;</p>
<p>*  Studying and recommending whether the committee should be rewritten into a permanent institution after a one-year trial period.</p>
<p>US representative Dulles said at a press conference</p>
<p>that this committee may be convened to discuss treaty</p>
<p>issues. Marshall had previously foreshadowed in Moscow that if the Austrian treaty did not make progress,</p>
<p>the matter should be submitted to the General Assembly, in which case it would be studied by the</p>
<p>Standing Committee. The Standing Committee may also study the Korean issue and the revision of the treaty with Italy, etc.</p>
<p>These issues have been placed on the agenda of the General Assembly. Regarding the Italian issue,</p>
<p>the United States is not yet prepared to</p>
<p>express its final opinion on whether it is appropriate to revise the treaty. The United States' goal is to</p>
<p>deal with issues that can be resolved through direct negotiation. Dulles also said that the committee was originally named</p>
<p>the "General Assembly Standing Committee on Peace and Security,"</p>
<p>but the words "Peace and Security" have now been deleted, with no</p>
<p>special meaning. Dulles later said that the Standing Committee will also examine issues</p>
<p>known to be submitted to the next General Assembly. According to Article 35 of the Charter,</p>
<p>member states have the option of submitting issues to the Security Council or the General Assembly. Dulles also said that Vyshinsky's criticism of this proposal was</p>
<p>not well thought out beforehand and that he expected that after careful consideration, he would realize that his</p>
<p>opposition was unjustified.</p>

<h3>Pakistan's Hatred of Indians: Gandhi Unwilling to Stand Idly By; Resort to War if Necessary</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from United Press, New Delhi, 27th] Gandhi, known throughout the world for his opposition to violence,</p>
<p>nevertheless, in a prayer meeting yesterday, authorized a representative to declare that if Pakistan does not acknowledge</p>

<p>The Mahatma opposes all wars, but there is no other way to</p>

<h3>French Tram and Bus Services Halt; Social Affairs Bureau's Efforts to Urge Resumption Fail; Labor Proposes Six Demands, Company Unresponsive</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Over two thousand seven hundred employees of the French Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>began a general work slowdown yesterday at 1:20 PM. French Red</p>
<p>buses and all levels of trams have all entered the depot and ceased operation; however, the hundred-plus workers in the electricity generation and water supply sections are still maintaining their work. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched personnel</p>
<p>to urge a resumption of work, but to no avail. All the workers gathered</p>
<p>at the company's union offices and in the square, and no resolution had been reached by evening.</p>
<p>The cause of this labor dispute lies in the accumulation of long-standing grievances between labor and management, and the labor organization is taking this opportunity to seek a thorough resolution. Labor has put forward six demands:</p>
<p>The company should clearly stipulate the standard for salary increase grades for staff. (The workers' portion was resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation at the end of last year.) Revision of the car service regulations. Undertake welfare initiatives: A, hospital for employees' families; B, employee dormitories; C, educational funds. Before these are implemented, a monthly subsidy of 15 yuan per person. Improve the facilities of schools for workers' children. Two days of leave per month without deduction of pay. Mid-Autumn Festival loan of 500,000 yuan per person, to be repaid in installments. Labor also limited the company authorities to respond before 12:00 noon. Around 1:00 PM, the company had not responded, and all French tram lines</p>
<p>and Red buses successively returned to the depot and went on strike.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the union to send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau for negotiations, but the person in charge of the union did not go.</p>
<p>When the company's industrial union held a temporary meeting in the union square around 4:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched inspector Zhu Chenghao to the</p>
<p>scene to express three opinions to the employees: The employees did not report this action to the Social Affairs Bureau in advance. All the issues raised should be resolved according to the law.</p>
<p>Immediately restore traffic. However, the employees did not heed the advice.</p>
<p>British Trams Once Obstructed</p>
<p>After the French trams went on strike, several dozen unidentified people</p>
<p>on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>obstructed the British Nos. 1 and 2 tram lines, claiming to be acting on the orders of Qiu Changjiang, chairman of the British Tram</p>
<p>Union, to halt services in support of the French employees. As a result, more than ten trams on lines 1 and 2 were obstructed. However, the British Tram Union clarified that it did not send anyone to obstruct the trams.</p>
<p>According to a message released by the Social Affairs Bureau last night: regarding the sudden strike by French tram workers today, the competent authorities have determined that the conditions put forward by the workers this time are</p>
<p>unreasonable and resemble coercion with a deadline, and the union has been ordered to immediately resume work or be considered as voluntarily resigning and be dismissed by the company. If the union cannot control the situation, it will be ordered to disband and personnel will be sent to reorganize it. At the same time, some people yesterday misused the name of the British tram union to forcibly obstruct the operation of vehicles, and they have been arrested by military and police</p>
<p>authorities to maintain public transport.</p>
<h3>Strike Before Arbitration Clearly Violates the Mobilization Order; Statements from the Mayor and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the</p>
<p>strike by the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company,</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, together with Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau,</p>
<p>temporarily summoned reporters from various newspapers yesterday afternoon to issue a statement saying: The French Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>workers are demanding a salary increase of 15 yuan and</p>
<p>an increase in grade level, which is clearly an increase in base salary.</p>
<p>Increasing the base salary violates the central government's explicit orders. Furthermore, they</p>
<p>went on strike without going through arbitration procedures and demanded that the company</p>
<p>authorities respond before 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>All of the above actions not only violate labor law,</p>
<p>but also violate the government's general mobilization order. This matter may be related to</p>
<p>the Shanghai Power Company's dismissal of communist workers,</p>
<p>so relevant parties have been ordered to investigate strictly. Deserving</p>
<p>workers will be allowed to return to work, while undesirable elements</p>
<p>will be punished. Mayor Wu also said that the British tram</p>
<p>company workers themselves did not want to strike, but</p>
<p>were incited by undesirable elements using the union's name.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company's trams were obstructed by criminals,</p>
<p>so the police bureau has been ordered to pay close attention</p>
<p>and arrest them immediately upon discovery. Currently, some</p>
<p>of the British Tram Company workers have resumed work.</p>
<p>The mayor also mentioned the case of the arrest of communist</p>
<p>activists at the Datong Printing House, saying that 13</p>
<p>people have been arrested, with one person surrendering, and</p>
<p>15 more are at large. The strike by the workers of the Water and Electricity Company</p>
<p>yesterday may have been instigated by the communists at large, and the municipal government will deal with it severely.</p>
<p>Director Wu Kaixian added to the reporters that the</p>
<p>workers of the French Water and Electricity Company did not report to</p>
<p>the Social Affairs Bureau before the strike, nor did they report</p>
<p>after the fact. The Social Affairs Bureau sent people to investigate upon hearing the news and warned the workers</p>
<p>that strike action was not permitted. The workers disregarded</p>
<p>the law. The union held a meeting at 3:00 PM, and</p>
<p>Zhu Chenghao of the Social Affairs Bureau attended and once again</p>
<p>warned them to resume work immediately. The responsibility should be borne by the</p>
<p>union. According to Zhu's report, the union representatives</p>
<p>asked the Social Affairs Bureau "why it wanted to disband the union,"</p>
<p>but in fact, the Social Affairs Bureau did not disband the union, which</p>
<p>is clearly being incited by others.</p>

<h3>Publication of September Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>Workers: 34,400 times; Staff: 30,800 times</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The city's September cost of living index has been compiled</p>
<p>and finalized by the Municipal Government Research Office and was published yesterday. The general cost of living index for workers is 34,400 times,</p>
<p>an increase of 11% compared to the previous month. The general cost of living index for staff is 30,800 times,</p>
<p>an increase of 15% compared to the previous month. The breakdown of the indices is as follows:</p>
<p>Index compiled by the union is similar.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee</p>
<p>held its fifth meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday morning</p>
<p>at 10:00 AM, chaired by Statistics Director Zhang Zongmeng. He reported that prices for this month</p>
<p>have generally increased. The reason why the worker index increased less than the staff index is that the price of</p>
<p>Jing rice increased more than Xian rice; workers use Xian rice and have rationed rice. Fish increased by 13%,</p>
<p>vegetable prices fell, oil, salt, and sugar rose, with rationing, and coal briquettes rose by 50%, but workers</p>
<p>have rationed coal. Cloth was stable in the first half of the month and rose in the second half, so the impact was not significant. Staff</p>
<p>had higher indices because of the increased price of tap water and movies, and no rationed rice or coal. Zhang</p>
<p>expressed great satisfaction that the labor union's independent survey and compilation of the cost of living index were similar to the index published by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun and Director Zhang Zhusan reported on the process of conducting field surveys in different districts, which coincided with the Municipal Government, so the labor sector can absolutely trust it.</p>

<h3>Humorous Case of Traitor: Genuine or Fake Zhu Ji; Members of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association with the Same Name Implicated; Secret Accusation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper]</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court</p>
<p>is handling the case of the</p>
<p>traitor Zhu Ji. Because the defendant's whereabouts are unknown, an arrest warrant has been issued. Now, the 1911</p>
<p>Revolution Comrades Association has sent a letter to the court, stating that the association has a comrade, also named</p>
<p>Zhu Ji, who is from Xiuning, Anhui, and is 61 years old. It is unknown whether the age and birthplace of the wanted</p>
<p>Zhu Ji are the same, and a request is made for verification. After the High Court</p>
<p>examined the indictment of the traitor Zhu Ji, it was stated that he was from Ningbo, Zhejiang,</p>
<p>and is 40 years old, which is different from what the association stated. By coincidence, there is also a Shen Youxin who secretly informed the court, saying that</p>
<p>Zhu Ji is nearly 50 years old, has a rectangular face, and because he has a mole above his eyebrow, he often wears a copper basin hat</p>
<p>to cover it up, and uses the name of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association as a cover. Please check whether this Zhu Ji has held the positions of</p>
<p>pseudo "Fengxian County Magistrate" and pseudo "Shanghai Special Municipality Fengxian District Director."</p>
<p>The High Court received these two letters and, because the truth is difficult to discern,</p>
<p>and the facts are unknown, and because Zhu Ji of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association is in Shanghai, it entrusted</p>
<p>the local court of this city to conduct an inquiry. The court opened at 2:00 PM yesterday,</p>
<p>presided over by Judge Huang Guangyu, who summoned and questioned the 61-year-old Zhu Ji about whether he had ever worked in Fengxian.</p>
<p>He replied: "I have never worked there. After seeing the report in the newspaper,</p>
<p>I wanted to declare to the Jiangsu High Court, but I thought that there are many people in the world with the same name, such as the Shanghai Mayor, Wu Guozhen, who has fourteen people with the same name,</p>
<p>so I gave up. During the War of Resistance, I never went to Fengxian." The court asked where he was during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>He replied that he was in the Tenth War Zone and was asked if he knew Shen Youxin. He replied that he did not know him. This Zhu Ji, who had no mole above his eyebrow, then said, "I am one of the founders of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association.</p>
<p>I participated in the revolution during the Huanghuagang Uprising and have never been a district</p>
<p>director." Zhou Dingsan of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association then testified to the court, "The association had an official letter sent to the High Court requesting verification,</p>
<p>but this Zhu Ji today is not that traitor Zhu Ji that the Jiangsu High Court wants. If this Zhu Ji is that Zhu Ji, then</p>
<p>we would not have written a letter to defend him."</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Assembly on the Draft Contract of the Joint Power Plant Retained; The Opinions of Various Councilors Are Collected and Transmitted to the Two Ministries for Research</h3>
<p>[Report from this</p>
<p>newspaper] The City</p>
<p>Council held its</p>
<p>sixth meeting</p>
<p>yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>to discuss two</p>
<p>proposals.</p>
<p>Regarding the</p>
<p>organization of the</p>
<p>Joint Electric Power</p>
<p>Company, the</p>
<p>discussion lasted</p>
<p>for three hours</p>
<p>before a unanimous</p>
<p>decision was made to</p>
<p>retain it for</p>
<p>discussion at the</p>
<p>next meeting.</p>
<p>Regarding the</p>
<p>organization of the</p>
<p>Joint Electric Power</p>
<p>Company, the mayor previously submitted the agreed-upon draft contract to the council for discussion.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Public Utilities and Legal Regulations Committees held a joint meeting to discuss the draft contract and made amendments to Articles 13, 15, and 24 of the draft.</p>
<p>At the afternoon meeting to discuss the draft contract, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau first explained, saying: "I believe</p>
<p>that this case is the most important proposal in this General Assembly. The establishment of the</p>
<p>Joint Power Plant will determine the future economic development of this city. The Joint Electric Power Company is proposed to be organized jointly by</p>
<p>Zhabei, Huashang, Pudong, Hangzhou and other Electric Power Co., Ltd., Shanghai Huxi Power Company, and Shanghai Power Company. It is a cooperative</p>
<p>institution of Sino-US enterprises. At present, the French Power Company has not been invited to participate, because it was not occupied by the enemy during the occupation period and cannot bear</p>
<p>the Japanese compensation motors. The main purpose is to reduce costs after the joint venture, so that the citizens of Shanghai can obtain</p>
<p>cheap electricity. The company can borrow 20 million US dollars from American businesses and can repay it over a long period of time. However,</p>
<p>regarding the phrase "This contract authorizes the President of the International Court of Justice" in the third line of Article 13 of the draft, just as</p>
<p>Councilor Ma Junshuo said, "The United Changli Company is a Chinese legal person and should abide by Chinese law, and should not authorize the President of the International Court of Justice." I also</p>
<p>agree with this point. Now it has been amended by the Public Utilities and Legal Regulations Committees, adding "After obtaining the consent of the Chinese judge and the American judge residing in the court, an arbitrator will be appointed" after this sentence.</p>
<p>Considered an Insult to National Sovereignty</p>
<p>Councilor Huang</p>
<p>Bingquan First Expressed</p>
<p>Support For</p>
<p>the formation of the Joint Electric Power Company, Councilor Bu Yongsheng</p>
<p>first expressed his opposition, believing that this electric power company</p>
<p>is purely for private profit. After the joint venture,</p>
<p>foreigners have an opportunity to annex the entire electric power company, so please retain this proposal and delay the contract. Fei Shusheng</p>
<p>continued, "After the conclusion of this type of contract, there is a loss of</p>
<p>our sovereignty, such as the so-called "authorization to the President of the International Court of Justice" in Article 13 of the contract, which is a disrespect for</p>
<p>our national laws. For decades, our country's enterprises have been bound by foreign capital.</p>
<p>Now that we have been slightly liberated, we should not be bound by foreign capital again in the future."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan believes that the contract clauses, especially Article 13, are simply "loss of power" and "insulting to the country."</p>
<p>He advocated retention, not for discussion, and asked the municipal government to send it to the Legislative Yuan for research first.</p>
<p>Explanation of Three Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Councilor Li Kaidi</p>
<p>Explained the Misunderstandings</p>
<p>of the Councilors, saying: The Joint Electric Power Company was convened by the municipal government and agreed upon by foreigners.</p>
<p>It was not initiated and organized by foreigners, so it cannot be said to be an attempt by foreigners to annex it. Solving the electricity shortage at present cannot be done without foreign exchange.</p>
<p>If the contract is not subject to the regulations of the Chinese company law, it would be considered a loss of power and insult to the country. This draft contract stipulates that it should be subject to the restrictions of the Chinese company law, so it cannot be considered a loss of power and insult to the country.</p>
<p>Zhu Wende also said that this draft contract seemed inappropriate at first, but after careful study, there was nothing inappropriate. It would be best to ask the central government</p>
<p>to study it. If no point of loss of power and insult to the country can be found, then we can accept it. But it would be best if the government could be self-reliant. Li Wenjie also said that this draft contract</p>
<p>is not inappropriate. Because for the organization of a legal person, if it is to be dissolved</p>
<p>or reorganized, the consent of three-quarters of the shareholders is required. At present, the shares invested by the Americans are less than 50%, and</p>
<p>the Americans really have no power to control the shares. This matter is quite cost-effective. At the same time, no point of loss of power and insult to the country can be found in it, but for the sake of careful consideration, please extend the discussion to the next meeting.</p>
<p>Hope for Careful Consideration</p>
<p>Lu Shidao said</p>
<p>that he picked up this</p>
<p>draft contract with anxiety, and entrusting such an important</p>
<p>organization to an organization that is not sure whether it is reliable or not for thirty-three years is really not reassuring.</p>
<p>Therefore, he hoped for careful consideration, and asked experts to study it first before discussing it. Jiang Huaisu also did not agree, believing that it was not easy to cancel unequal treaties after eight years of war, and now there is such a contract again.</p>
<p>At the same time, how could a country be a country if a local incident in one country</p>
<p>is turned into an international issue and a request is made to the International Court of Justice for a judgment? Wang Xianqing</p>
<p>said that there was not only no, but "not a single" point of loss of power and insult to the country in the draft contract. It is not against national policy for our country's people to jointly run enterprises with foreign businesses.</p>
<p>But Tao Baichuan firmly stated that there were indeed those who lost power and insulted the country. He solemnly requested that the discussion be retained until the next meeting, and that a thirty-three year contract should not be signed rashly in order to delay it for three months.</p>
<p>As a result, Zhan Wengu put forward two specific opinions: Can you please submit the original English manuscript for the councilors to refer to again.</p>
<p>The council will continue to study it, and please also have our country's true legal experts or seniors, such as Wang Chonghui, study it together.</p>
<p>Mayor Expressed His Opinion</p>
<p>Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Expressed His Opinion</p>
<p>Saying that self-reliance is certainly very much in favor, but looking at the facts of China, in the recent twenty or thirty years, construction projects cannot be done without foreign investment. He listed that the urban construction projects in the United States before the First World War were all invested by the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Now foreign capital is not using us, but we are using foreign capital. This cannot be considered a loss of power and insult to the country, but can be called devotion to the country. In addition, when the United Kingdom invested in the United States, there were many problems that arose, and they were also adjudicated by the International Court of Justice. Therefore, in order not to strike a blow to the absorption of foreign capital, on the one hand, according to the procedure, it should be sent to the Executive Yuan to be handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study whether it is a loss of power and insult to the country, and on the other hand,</p>
<p>the council will study it again to allow sufficient time for consideration.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Councilor Tao Baichuan said that the local government should not send a proposal to the Executive Yuan before it has been resolved by the local legislative body. Mayor Changjue felt that Councilor Tao's opinion was very correct, and changed his words to ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study it.</p>
<h3>Discussion Will Be Continued at the Next Meeting</h3>
<p>In the end, the Speaker summarized the various</p>
<p>opinions:</p>
<p>All the opinions of the councilors during the discussion at this meeting will be</p>
<p>recorded. If there are any details that are not clear,</p>
<p>please ask the councilors to submit written supplements</p>
<p>to the secretariat.</p>
<p>The above records will be sent to the municipal government and forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for research. The municipal government is requested to reprint the original English manuscript of the draft contract and distribute it to the councilors for research.</p>
<p>This case will be retained for discussion at the next meeting. The General Assembly unanimously passed the above opinions, and the debate on this case came to a temporary end.</p>
<h3>Opening Zhejiang Road Bridge</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Council, regarding the Speaker's motion</p>

<h3>Fuzhou and Xiamen Airports: Ministry of Communications Plans Improvements</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 21st] The Xiamen Heshan Airport and the Fuzhou Yiyu Airport are far from meeting the ideal airport equipment standards.

<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 25th] Xu Lanruo, the county magistrate of this county, once served as the county magistrate of Longquan County, Zhejiang Province, for many years during the Anti-Japanese War.

<p>Li Shuhua Returns to Peiping and Talks About the Financial Difficulties of the Peiping Research Institute</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th] Li Shuhua, vice president of the Peiping Research Institute, said upon his return to Peiping that financial difficulties are affecting the work of the institute. The institute has not added any equipment for ten years, and various departments urgently need to replenish their supplies. The foreign exchange allocation of 2,500 US dollars is not enough to solve the problem. The original plan to build an atomic research building in Peiping with 5 billion yuan may not be easy to realize. Even building a small atomic research institute requires 200,000 US dollars. Therefore, the relocation of the Shanghai Radium Research Institute to Peiping will be difficult to achieve in the short term. Everything depends on the central government increasing the education budget to 15% of the total budget.</p>

<p>Professors from Northeastern Universities Request the Ministry of Education to Improve Their Treatment and Request Foreign Exchange to Replenish Equipment</p>
<p>[Our report, 27th] The Professors' Association of Northeastern Universities has telegraphed the Ministry of Education requesting improved treatment, including the provision of food as in Beijing and Shanghai, free winter coal, and subsidies for winter clothing. The reason given is that cotton cloth, wool fabric, rice, flour, and daily necessities in the Northeast are supplied from within the customs, and prices are higher than within the customs, making monthly income insufficient to maintain life, facing the risk of freezing and starvation. They also requested the allocation of sufficient funds and foreign exchange to replenish the books, instruments, and equipment of Northeastern universities and colleges so that they can reach modern cultural standards. It was also stated that the Japanese gathered Japanese students from puppet universities in Manchuria near Kyushu this spring, providing them with sufficient funds to specialize in the study of Northeastern issues in our country. In contrast, our treatment is not as good as that of public servants in state-owned institutions. If people value the root and we pursue the tip, isn't the future of the Northeast sad?</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Police officer Wu Zhipeng of the Penglai Police Bureau in Nanshi received a tip-off the night before last, saying that Bian Fengming, a major shareholder of a major theater in Nanshi and a native of Shandong, was hiding a large quantity of morphine in his residence. After leading police chief Ye Bairong and others to Bian's residence at No. 8 Fushentang Street, Dananmen, they found three Ruyi bags in the Five Dou Shu drawer, containing three taels of morphine, two million in cash, diamond rings, gold rings, earrings, and other items. However, Bian had already escaped and fled. Only his concubine, Ma Peiyu, and five others, including the driver Liu Changshi, were arrested and taken to the bureau. Soon after, Bian Fengming's father, Daolin, arrested Chen Rufu, who was Bian Fengming's contact, claiming that Chen had framed him. However, Chen firmly denied this and said that he would have Chen A'yuan and others who had been addicted to testify at the bureau. The case will be transferred to the court for investigation and handling after the investigation is completed.</p>
<h3>Female Thief Case: Dancing Girl Commits Robbery with Accomplices, Police Officers Disguise Themselves to Make Arrest</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A female thief case was cracked in the Jinshan Dance Hall on Hankou Road in this city the other day, which was quite like a movie plot. A dancing girl named Cao Ping (originally named Cao Ruiying, 25 years old, from Jiangsu) partnered with her lover Zhang Guanglie and friend Zhang Nianchun on the evening of July 7th this year to rob the home of Cai Zhu on Kuaiji Road No. 43, stealing gold rings, gold ingots, and other items. However, when the victim screamed for help, Zhang Guanglie fled from the front door when he heard the police arrive. Cao and Zhang Nianchun exited through the back door, and in the chaos, the two separated. At that time, police officers and passersby gathered, and Chang arrested Zhang Nianchun, while Cao escaped when the target shifted.</p>
<p>After finding her lover Zhang Guanglie, Cao went to the Bund Park to report the incident. She gave a pistol to Zhang to take to Pudong, and has not been heard from since. Cao had no one to rely on and had no choice but to live in the Xinle Palace Theater in the New Hostel on Hubei Road and joined the Jinshan Dance Troupe as a dance partner until now.</p>
<p>After receiving news of Cao, the police bureau sent police officers Shao Guanrong and Zhang Yunming, disguised as dance guests, to name Cao Ping in the Jinshan Dance Hall, sat at her table and danced with her, and were exceptionally enthusiastic, especially inquiring about Cao's background. Cao inadvertently revealed her real name during this exhaustive questioning. At that time, the two police officers showed their identities and immediately arrested her.</p>
<p>The pistol belonged to Zhang Nianchun, and Zhang Guanglie is now in Pudong, but his address is unknown. In addition to continuing to investigate Zhang's arrest, Cao was transferred to the prosecutor's office yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dispute in Front of the Gong Stage over Wanting to Enter and Watch the Play</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At about 9:50 last night, more than 30 people in uniforms of unknown units suddenly wanted to enter the Gong Stage Theater on Zhongzheng Middle Road to watch the play. The military police and discipline inspection team stationed in the theater repeatedly tried to dissuade them to no avail, so they urgently telegraphed the military police team of the Golden Theater to come and suppress the situation. Captain Liu fired two shots into the sky as a warning, and fortunately no one was injured. The crowd then dispersed. The two people who were arrested were taken to the Songshan Police Sub-Bureau and then handed over to the garrison command for punishment.</p>
<h3>Summer in Autumn: Yesterday's Temperature Reached a High of 96 Degrees, Meteorological Observatory Predicts No Moon for Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>It is late autumn, but the weather is abnormal. Yesterday, the highest temperature reached 96 degrees, and the lowest was 77 degrees. According to meteorological sources, this sudden warming is due to tropical air currents in the Pacific basin invading the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in oppressive heat that swept away all signs of autumn. However, a strong cold current from the Lake Baikal region in Siberia has been moving southeastward, and it is expected to reach the lower reaches of the Yangtze River this afternoon, where it will come into contact with the stagnant hot air. The weather is expected to cool down, and it is predicted that the weather in the city this morning will be muggy, but after 5 p.m., due to the invasion of the cold air center, the temperature will drop significantly, and there may be local showers. Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, and the observatory predicts that the weather may be overcast and rainy, so there will be no bright moon to admire this year.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Cracked in Cishu Building: Nine Men and One Woman Interrogated</h3>

The police sub-bureau in charge learned of this and sent police officers to arrest the gamblers on the spot at about 7 p.m. last night. The gamblers were all well-known people in industry and commerce, including nine men and one woman: Qian Junqing, Chen Xiangting, Xu Keming, Pan Min, Zhang Wenmiao, Wang Deshun, Zhuang Zhen, and his wife Zhuang Chen Yueying.

<h3>A Scare on the Edge of Hefei</h3>
<p>Two Battalions of Bandit Troops Annihilated in the Battle of Taoxi Town</p>
<p>Because Hefei occupies an</p>
<p>important strategic position,</p>
<p>when the bandit troops occupied</p>
<p>Luan and Shucheng,</p>
<p>they actively moved</p>
<p>towards Hefei from the south</p>
<p>and southwest, reaching</p>
<p>a close proximity of fifty li</p>
<p>from Hefei. At that time, the</p>
<p>troops defending Hefei had more</p>
<p>than enough strength, but going</p>
<p>out to meet them was militarily a near miss. How many bandits entered Anhui has always been a mystery. Military estimates put the number at about six or seven thousand. It was not until a unit of the National Army's XXX Division arrived in Hefei, followed by the entire XXX Division, that they launched attacks from the south and southwest, and the bandit troops fled in disarray. In the Battle of Taoxi Town, as many as two battalions were annihilated.</p>
<p>All Agencies Ordered to Adopt Contingency Measures</p>
<p>When the news of the abandonment of Luan</p>
<p>reached Hefei,</p>
<p>the provincial government agencies began</p>
<p>contingency measures.</p>
<p>Each employee received two months' salary,</p>
<p>important documents were packed into boxes, and Chairman Li</p>
<p>Pinxian ordered each agency to</p>
<p>expedite work, store</p>
<p>grain and grass, and rush to build city</p>
<p>defenses. These were originally</p>
<p>should be and necessary,</p>
<p>but "sensitive" people thought the situation was serious, and people were scaring each other. Any rumor was not judged for truth or falsehood and was quickly spread. Every face on the street showed a look of panic. Rickshaw drivers and porters temporarily increased in price tenfold, only allowed to open their mouths to ask for money, not allowed to haggle. Those who could not leave Hefei decided to stay and stored rice and grass, so the price of rice broke the 300,000 mark, especially firewood, with the highest price being 110,000 per load. The Security Command issued a notice strictly prohibiting making please or raising prices.</p>
<p>Boxes and Cages in the Backflow, People's Hearts Tend to Stabilize</p>
<p>Until the afternoon of the thirteenth,</p>
<p>Taoxi Town was recovered, and</p>
<p>sixty prisoners were escorted. Also,</p>
<p>National Army troops went to the southwestern countryside to search</p>
<p>for scattered bandits who had disintegrated into smaller groups.</p>
<p>The people of Hefei began to feel</p>
<p>calm. Today, boxes</p>
<p>and luggage are gradually returning.</p>
<p>People no longer feel as</p>
<p>shocked by the military works</p>
<p>in the streets and alleys as they did before.</p>
<p>People of Hefei should remain calm</p>
<p>and vigilant,</p>
<p>and increase their vigilance.</p>
<h3>Recovering Shucheng</h3>
<p>Our reporter took a car</p>
<p>on the 21st to Shucheng,</p>
<p>seventy kilometers from Hefei,</p>
<p>which had just been recovered</p>
<p>from the bandits, and was detained for three hours. When he entered the city, many shops were still not open, and there were few pedestrians on the street, like stars in the morning. A tall tower in the northeast corner of the city stood quietly in the autumn sun, and the scene appeared very desolate.</p>
<p>The bandit troops arrived in Shucheng at dawn on the 7th. Except for the agencies that had time to evacuate, many old people were still dreaming. When they woke up, they realized that everything had changed and turned into a world of bandit bandits!</p>
<p>After the bandits occupied the county seat, they sent a Shandong native named Zhao Fujian to serve as the puppet county magistrate. It is said that this Zhao had been disguised in Shucheng "waiting for a vacancy" a month ago. After "taking office," he summoned those who had not had time to escape to a meeting, talking nonsense, and pretending to be benevolent and righteous on the one hand, saying that he would not disturb the people, and on the other hand, he mobilized 2,000 people to attack Taoxi Town. However, the fox's tail could not be hidden. With a shake of the body, revealing the hideous face, extorted from the local area, asking for 150 million, and under the pressure of violence, who dared to haggle. At the same time, for those who had more food and clothing, they used the excuse of investigating the household registration to search them one by one, raping, robbing, which was more severe than the Japanese during the War of Resistance. In the eleven days, Shucheng's wealth was looted.</p>
<p>Li Pinxian, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government</p>
<p>[Our dispatch from Hefei on the 23rd] This time, the bandit troops of Liu Bocheng's unit roamed from southern Henan to Anhui. In twenty days, they successively broke into ten county seats, and five million people suffered direct disasters. Now, the key military county towns in central and western Anhui have been recovered one after another, and the bandit troops' momentum seems to have passed. However, the bandit troops avoid attacking fortifications, and even when there is a road to escape, they dare not contact the National Army. Its main force has not yet been annihilated and is still lingering in the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>Xia Wei, Commander of the Eighth Appeasement Zone</p>
<p>An elderly man told the reporter that the bandit troops in Shucheng preached that everyone had food to eat, but they looted Shucheng empty, only they had food to eat, and the common people had no food to eat. During the occupation, the common people longed for the National Army as much as a great drought longs for rain clouds. However, the bandit troops in the city fabricated rumors that their troops had reached the city of Hefei, and that more than thirty feet of the south gate of Hefei had collapsed, and that the National Army in Hefei had withdrawn, making the common people confused and not knowing when they would see the light of day again! Many wounded soldiers came down from Taoxi Town, and only then did they know that the bandit troops had suffered a loss, and they were secretly happy.</p>
<p>Meeting an officer of the Shucheng Protection Brigade, who had assisted the National Army in the battle, he said that there were more than 5,000 bandit troops in Shucheng, but their equipment was very bad, especially lacking ammunition. It was a pity that the local military force was too poor. The police team had a cannon, but it could not fire even after thirteen rounds. The fourteenth round was fired half a mile away, but it did not explode, and many rifles did not have bayonets. The urgent need to strengthen the local military force can be said to be an obvious fact.</p>
<p>Now, the XXX Division headquarters is stationed in Shucheng. The reporter visited Division Commander Zhang Shiguang for the third time. Because both were limited in time, they only had a ten-minute conversation. He told the reporter that he had fought with Liu Bocheng's troops in southern Henan and was now fighting in central Anhui. Liu Bocheng had been fleeing for thousands of miles and was already exhausted, but its main force still had remnants. We must search for its main force and annihilate it. It does not attack fortifications, to make it encounter fortifications, with no road to escape. Division Commander Zhang is from Pingjiang, Hunan, and he knows many friends in the press.</p>
<p>On the Shuhe Highway, from Southern Henan to Shucheng, the highway and electric wires were mostly destroyed, but the Highway Bureau and the Hefei Electric Power Bureau of the Ministry of Communications quickly repaired them, which greatly helped the military progress. (Reporter Shi Baiping)</p>
<h3>Liao Qiujie, Director of the Beijing Salt Affairs Administration, Inspects the Yuyao Salt Field, Says Salt Price Too Low, Should Be Increased, Assault Incident to Be Resolved by Judicial Means</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch from Hangzhou on the 27th] The Yuyao Andong League Field Administration in Zhejiang forced the league members to submit their salt to the warehouse for inspection, causing salt farmers to be injured in the beating, arousing public anger. Liao Qiujie, Director of the Beijing Salt Affairs Administration, specially went to inspect it and returned to Beijing this morning. It is said that the current salt price is 28,000 per load, which is indeed too low and should be increased. As for the two-thirds salt loan, the salt field owes more than 5 billion, but during the slack sales season, the salt field's capital turnover is not working, which is a factual difficulty. When the peak sales season comes, this matter can be resolved. In order to facilitate the salt farmers in the meantime, funds will be raised to pay a portion of the loan after returning to Beijing. It is illegal for league members to refuse to hand in salt and should immediately restore salt handing to the warehouse. The assault incident has been sent to the judicial authorities for resolution.</p>
<h3>Cheng Jiong Arrives in Chengdu to Discuss the Issue of Demobilized Military Officers</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch from Chengdu on the 21st] According to</p>
<p>Cheng Jiong, head of the first group of the Central Training Corps for the Rehabilitation of Military Officers, who has just arrived in Chengdu from Kunming, told reporters that a total of 1,017 demobilized military officers assigned to work in Sichuan's local administration reported to the Sichuan Provincial Government in Chengdu in early May from Chongqing, Xi'an, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places to await assignment. Subsequently, the provincial government assigned colonels to various departments and offices in the name of councilors for practical training, lieutenant colonels in the name of supervisors or inspectors, and majors in the name of supervisors or府 secretaries.</p>
<h3>Bankruptcy of Thousands, Losses of Hundreds of Billions: Tragic Fighting in Guangji, Rumored to Be Related to Last Year's Election</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch from Hankou on the 27th] A tragic case of fighting has occurred in Guangji again. Residents surnamed Zhou in the area gathered surnames Wei, Zhang, and Zhu on the 14th and 18th of this month to provoke Liu and Song, resulting in an unprecedented fight. Both sides were equipped with weapons such as light machine guns and rifles. The war</p>
<p>The money spread over ten li. The two sides suffered many casualties. As a result, the Liu and Song surnames were defeated, and the Zhou surname took advantage of the victory to set fire, burning more than a thousand villages of the Liu and Song surnames to the ground. It is estimated that thousands of families went bankrupt and losses exceeded hundreds of billions, which is regrettable. The cause of the incident is rumored to be related to last year's election.</p>
<p>Captains and below were assigned to various counties and cities in the name of instructors and clerks for practical training. Only 350 officers were actually employed within a few months, and their monthly income did not exceed 400,000 yuan, which led to a petition to Chairman Deng on the 2nd of this month. Team leader Cheng Jiong made a special trip to Chengdu to solve this problem. It is reported that the central government has concrete measures, and a clear order can be issued as soon as the other five inspection team leaders return to Nanjing from all over the country.</p>
<h3>Opening Up the Hangzhou Bay Channel, Plans to Invite Merchants to Bid for Contract</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch from Hangzhou on the 26th] In order to open up the Hangzhou Bay channel, the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau specially hired experts with more than thirty years of experience from the Hankou Customs to engage in surveying work. However, due to lack of funds, it plans to invite merchants to contract. The merchants who are willing to invest will own the navigation rights in the future.

<p>Chiang Ching-kuo has decided to visit the</p>
<p>Youth Army 202nd Division in Su tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The rumor that he would arrive in Su this afternoon</p>

<h3>Case of Throwing Materials into the Sea</h3>
<p>Zhuang Kunhou, Director of the Xiamen Storage and Transportation Station of the General Relief Administration, Has Been Summoned for Questioning</p>
<p>[Our dispatch from Fuzhou on the 27th]</p>
<p>The Xiamen Storage and Transportation Station of the General Relief Administration</p>
<p>threw a large number of almost</p>
<p>completely good materials into the sea some days ago.</p>

<p>Kunhou, the director of the station, was summoned for questioning.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Couple Commits Suicide by Jumping Off a Cliff: One Dead, One Injured</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch from Fuzhou on the 22nd] Hou Mingyu, from Puli Township, Linsen County, had known Ma Qiuchen, a woman from the same township, for a long time, and the two were deeply in love. After graduating from Linsen County High School last year, Hou went to Shanghai, and he and Ma had been separated for many years. The woman's father has now betrothed her to Qiu Jingguan, the son of Qiu Desan in Yuanyang Village. Qiuchen strongly opposed her father's decision because she and Hou had privately made a marriage agreement. Father and daughter often quarreled. The day before yesterday, Hou Mingyu heard the news and returned from Shanghai, and also learned that Ma's wedding was imminent. He then made an appointment with the woman to temporarily climb Gushan, a famous scenic spot in Fuzhou, and stayed at Mingyue Building. They confided in each other and neither side wanted to break the agreement. However, the environment was such that it was difficult to fulfill their wishes. They then developed a thought of厭世. The day before yesterday, in the清晨 morning, Hou and the woman together climbed the Gushan Peak, looked down at the wide area, and then jumped off the cliff together to end their troubles. The woman was too weak and jumped to the waist of the cliff, hanging on a tree with injuries to her hands and feet, screaming for help. Hou fell straight down the cliff, his head was broken and bloody, and he died immediately. The villagers at the foot of the peak heard the screams and rushed to rescue her. The woman's injuries were not life-threatening. After this incident, Shigu was in an uproar.</p>
