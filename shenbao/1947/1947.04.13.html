<p>〔華東社〕據國府秘書曹聖芬談，滬市物價連日波動，主席業已得悉，甚表關懷，且爲安定民生，確保地方治安起見，已令吳市長·宣司令負責從速抑平。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕主席在滬將有兩日勾留，預定十四日上午九時在中正公園檢閱青年軍二〇二師後返京。</p>
<p>靑年軍二〇二師奉命接防滬市，已有一部抵達。該師師最羅澤聞氏昨午二時三刻由蘇州乘快車來滬·據談該師可於今晚前全部到達，十四日將在中正公園舉行檢閱。</p>

<h3>蘇北民間印象記（一）城裏和城外是兩個世界</h3>
<p>— 本報記者章繩治</p>
<p>蘇北，這一塊廣大的平原上，到現在爲止，依然充滿着火藥味和血腥氣。人民在水深火熱之中，過着比猪好得有限的生活，活着的人在夾縫中被磨折得透不過氣來，這裏你很難從一個人的面龐上輕易找出一絲笑容來，就是一個小孩子，他的表情亦是那樣的嚴肅，這不應該有的現象，使他無形中平添了十歲的年紀。</p>
<p>當我們踏上蘇北的公路上時，首先觸目看到的是一座一座的圓形碉堡，這許多建築材料，都是從那些被打毀了的民房上移拆下來的。</p>
<p>東台的周圍，更有着一座長達七里的「新的長城」，二三丈厚的基層，顯得相當的結實，一方面可以說這是代表軍民合作的結晶品，但是從另一方面說，這亦足表示蘇北除了些點綫以外，尙難達到眞正綏靖的地步。</p>
<p>在蘇北任何的一個縣城裏儘管是一片昇平氣象，但是當你走到城門口的時候，你好像又掉入另一個世界中，層層的鐵絲網，滿佈着工事的前面，荷槍實彈的士兵，三三兩兩的守望着碉堡，這景象又是那樣的蕭殺緊張，和五分鈸前在城裏看到的，是那樣絕對的不調和。眼前看到的，僅是一片蔚藍色的天，襯着一片灰色的瓦礫堆，剛才的一番愉快心情，即刻會被冲淡得一無所有！</p>
<p>記得到如皋的那一天，老百姓爲了歡迎記者團，街道上打掃得一乾二凈，但是當我們聽到去年收復的時候，却是城外死屍遍野，三月之後，猶是腥臭難聞。這一些恐怖的現象，到現在還深深地鐫印在每一個人的心頭，沒法被掃除去。</p>
<p>一個偶然的機會，我們在一連串的參觀和招待會的節目中，偷得一小時的空閒，給我溜到城外去看看，這裏沒有例外，碉堡和鐵絲網，成了唯一的點綴品。我們在路旁的一家小雜貨店中，和一位店主東的女兒，談了起來，這一家富有戲劇性的小店，倒亦是「三朝遺老」，我們由僞幣談到抗幣，再由抗幣又談到國幣，這樣的一換再換，這家原先規模相當大的雜貨店，就變成了現在的一爿小烟紙店。道位店主東的女兒原是如皋女中的學生，因爲受過中等敎育，一則言語可以講得通，二則看法可以更加深刻一層。所以大家愈談愈起勁，她苦笑着說：「戰爭中的燒和殺，固然是老百姓直接身受的禍害，但是幣制的屢次更換，却才是廣大民衆的致命打擊」。又說：「現在民衆的購買力薄弱得太可憐了，就拿我這爿小店來說罷，一天生意萬把塊錢，賺的錢吃粥還不够」。剛巧對面是一家猪肉店，因爲如皋是出產猪的地方，所以價錢比較起來，還算最便宜，那天的行市每斤是二千八百元。我問她你們是不是每天可以吃到肉，她笑了一笑，臉紅紅的說：「那裏能够，牠是掛在我們的眼前，並不是掛在我們的嘴前呀」！</p>
<p>我們在她的苦笑聲中，結束了談話。當我們跨出她的店門的時候，彼此都有一顆沉重的心。</p>
<p>在一條小小的街口，又看到一個從鄕區裏來的老百姓，給檢查哨截住了，他從一件破棉襖裏掏出一張臨時通行證來，上面貼着一張二寸半身的小照，當然沒有錯，不過那張照片，決不是上海攝影室櫉窗中所陳列的那樣「甜美」，却是一副哭喪着臉的姿態，呆呆的一個頭。這張通行證的下面，是一個鄉長的簽名，上面寫着有效時期，僅是三天。</p>
<p>檢查哨上，配合着一個警察，一個士兵和一個女檢查員，他們三位一體的檢查着過往的鄉人城民，上身摸摸，下體揑揑，工作得很認眞。</p>
<p>在這裏的鄕間，我們很少看到一隻狗，有人說狗給人吃光了。但是有人認爲狗全是餓死的。</p>
<p>一位農民告訢我，他在城郊替人家種了三畝田，一家五口子，種下來的，光顧吃飯還不够，平時全靠替人家挑糞賺些錢，勉强才糊口的。我問他：鄕下的捐稅多不多，他無可奈何的說，這是沒有一定的，要看鄕長如何了。</p>
<p>我們回到城裏的時候，有人勸吿我們不要在城外亂跑。理由是這裏並沒有「承平」。</p>
<p>夜間的黑色，更帶來了恐怖之感。城裏九點鐘沒有電燈了，街頭上戒了嚴，哨兵遠遠地就在高聲要「口令」，尖刀裝在槍上，躱在黑暗的角落裏，騫地襄令人嚇一大跳。好在城裏老百姓生活過慣了。沒有事六點鐘就關了門，早早的安晏了，留下來的僅甚死一樣的城。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>正論美蘇關係</h3>
<p>昨天是美國故總統羅斯福逝世的兩週紀念日，看到莫斯科四國外長會議意見紛歧的情形，再聽到美國前商務部長華萊士在倫敦發表的演說，益使我們悼惜這位偉大的國際政治外交家的逝世。我們敢大胆的假定，如果這位偉大的領袖仍在人問，述用其政治外交家的智慧，與其他各國的政治外交家，共同締造戰後世界永久的和平，決不致造成當前劍拔弩張的局勢。所以羅斯福總統的撒手長逝，不僅是美國失去了一位偉大的領袖，而且也是全世界的一大損失，我們回顧前瞻，不難證明今日的世界，格外需要像羅斯福總統那樣的偉大人物，出來領導世人，使戰後千孔百瘡的世界走上和平繁榮的坦途。</p>
<p>不可否認的，今日的世界，不僅難望踏入和平民主的新時代，而且舉世均在劍拔弩張的情勢之下；新的戰爭的危機，潛伏在四處，隨時隨地都有爆發的可能。我們作這種的說法，並非故意危言聳聽，而我們眞的用意，乃在以第三者的立塲喚起列强政治外交家的注意，隨時運用其政治智慧，挽狂瀾於未倒。但這怎樣始能克服當前世界危機呢？所謂仁者見仁，智者見智，當然可有許多不同的方法；殊途同歸，以達到同一樣的目的。我們姑將其他一切的辦法和主張，近之不論，而先就華萊七自辭職以來所發表的言論主張，加以公正的評論。</p>
<p>華萊士的生張「一個世界」，並力言美蘇兩國有通力合作的必要，在原則上必爲愛好和平各國人士所一致同意，尤其是華萊士前天在倫敦發表談話稱：「美國若不能與蘇聯致諒解，則第三次世界大戰勢將不可避免·」更是一針見血之論，不僅是我們完全同感？就是美國外交當局，也是抱着這種見解；，我們看看最近一年來的美國外交，可以說無往而不企求蘇聯的諒解。英國千方百計，欲與蘇聯締結同盟條約，更爲明顯；但是這種一味討好蘇聯的綏靖政策，不僅未能促進蘇聯與英美間的邦交，而且雙方的猜忌與疑懼，反而愈演愈深，以致造成目前無法打開的僵局。所以華萊士的主張，並不是在理論上的「是」與「不是」的問題，而且在現實上的能行與不能行的問題。例如華萊士說：「自羅斯福總統逝世以來，美國即已喪失領導之資格，因此東歐若千國家即採取行動，使世界分裂爲兩個世界曾受蘇聯的支持，是顯而易見的事實。此在美國政府匪特不爲世界保持統一而加倍努力，反而聽任其分裂，且認爲戰爭已不可避免。』從這一般談話，也可以看出今日的世界分裂爲兩個世界的原因：一是羅斯福的逝世，使美國在國際上失去領導資格；二是蘇聯支持東歐國家的採取分裂行動；三是美國未能爲保持一個世界而加倍努力。由此可知華萊士的片面攻擊美國政府的外交政策，自不能認爲有充分理由，而僅能同爲失意政客對於政府的一種吹毛求疵而已。</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立塲，平心靜氣，觀察自大戰結束以來的美蘇關係，所以呈現出若接若離的情形，最重要的原因，乃在有兩種因素的決定力量，正是勢均力敵，但有時也忽上忽下。戰後美蘇兩國，受了上次大戰血的敎訓，均深知戰爭的可怖，尤其在原子能的時代，若再發生大戰，人類唯有自取毀滅，因此對於和平，格外覺得可愛。所以大家企求和平，是戰後美蘇兩國傾向於「合」的向心力。但是美蘇兩國在思想上，是截然不同的兩種典型，加以在實際利害上，又處在水火不相容的地位。對於戰後所發生的任何國際問題，美蘇的利害終是背道而馳，旣不能折衷又無法妥協，因此美蘇兩國不論在歐洲也好，在逮東太平洋也好，處處要發生磨擦。所以思想不同，利害不一致，是美蘇間傾向於「分」的離心力。這兩種勢力的消長，就形成美蘇關係的若接若離；也就造成世界局勢的明暗不定。</p>
<p>正因爲美蘇兩國尙有共同之點，大家都企求和平，蘇聯要求在和平的空氣中，從事於物質的建設，充實社會主義的國家，使其眞正能够保障自己的生存，不愁外來的侵略；美國也要世界能在和平的氛圍裏休養生息，造成普遍的和平與繁榮，使美國的工商業得有出路。使美國不惜任何代價參加這次大戰，也能取得若千報償。所以美蘇兩國，儘管思想不同，利害不一致，終要設法謀得兩國的合作，共同維持世界和平，使兩國戚蒙其利。自大戰結束迄今，未及二年，而在這短短的時期中，不知舉行過多少次的國際會議，即以這次莫斯科四國外長會議而論，從頭到尾，美蘇的意見就互相矛盾的，何以莫洛托夫與馬歇爾二人舌戰不厭，有如此好的耐心？大家終是想討論出一個妥協辦法來。吾則早已不歡而散了。所以美蘇至今還保特着正常的關係，不致陷於決裂，其原因也就在此。不過我們對於這一個向心力，不能估計過大，否則就要犯過分樂觀的錯誤。而且各種因素所造成的離心力，更是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>第一是思想的不同，美國是資本主義的國家，蘇聯是共實主義的國家，不僅在思想上互相對立；而且對於任何名詞，都有不同的見解。例如美蘇所共同企求的和平民主，也是所見各不相同；蘇聯所企求的世界和平，是在蘇聯領導之下的世界和平；同樣美國所企求的和平，也是在美國領導之下的世界和平；而且雙方所採取的方法，又復各不相同，蘇聯欲以其擴充「安全地帶」的方法，鞏固其所領導的世界和平，美國則憑其原子能的秘密，世界基地曁金元外交的力量，維持世界和平。至於美蘇對於民主的觀念，更加不同了。蘇聯曾斥英美式的民主爲十八世紀的民主，而英美則又以蘇聯式的民主，稱爲全能主義。</p>
<p>第二是利害的衝突，美蘇對於任何問題，在原則上的意見，雖然大抵相同的，但是在實際利書上，却處處發生衝突。不論對付德國或管制日本，在原則上雖無意見，但在對於實施辦法，意見就大相逕庭了；莫斯科外長會議陷於僵局，即以此故。</p>
<p>第三是猜忌和疑懼，美國懷疑蘇聯到處擴張勢力，並樹立「鐵幕」，破壞美國所謂自由民主的原則；此在蘇聯則懷疑美國，旣不肯宣佈原子能秘密，又處處行使其金元外交，在經濟上援助反蘇國家無一不是對蘇聯的咸脅。因此雙方互相猜忌，互相疑懼，愈演愈深，以致無法消除。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知美蘇間的離心力，日漸滋長，今日的國際政治外交家若不能及時運用其智慧，挽在瀾於未倒，則其後患實不堪設想，我們固然期望美國的政治外交家，運用其智慧；使美蘇之間恢復互信互讓的精神；但是猜忌與疑懼的消除，當非一方面的警覺所消除；蘇聯態度若不能改變，華萊士的主張不論如何合乎理想，終究還是一種不切邊際的空論很少有實現的可能性。所以我們要向美蘇兩國政治外交家大聲疾呼：運用政治智　，消除兩國間之誤會，比其時矣。</p>

<h3>蘇外長正式建議四強共管魯爾區　蕯爾問題不願即予決定　會中曾就佔合併問題展開激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十二日廣播：今日外長會議完成關於德國未來政治機構之討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十一日電〕莫洛托夫今日在外長會中反對法國建議使魯爾萊茵兩區脫離德國之議。渠云議目標在分解並淸算德國國家，蘇政府碍難同意。德國人民不應被剝奪其國家，此舉將驅使德國人民成爲仇敵，投入「報復者及　武者」之懷抱。渠認佔領期間四强管制魯爾爲歐洲安全所不可缺。關於法國要求使薩爾併入法國經濟之議，莫洛托夫聲明尙須繼續予以研究。莫洛托夫繼即抨擊德境英美兩區經濟之合併，謂合併之結果，魯爾區已由兩盟國控制，但蘇聯與法國仍不護參與，此實及常的布置。英美合併其兩佔領區後，　際等於將德國分成東西兩部，開始分解德國，因此德國政治及經濟之統一，遂爲其破壞。魯爾必須置於四强共管之下，始能如馬歇爾及貝文昨日所稱者之使該區爲歐洲之利益服務。關於盟國對德之其他土地要求，莫洛托夫聲言渠尙未及予以一一研究，故暫時不凖備提出意見。馬歇爾國務卿於莫洛托夫述畢即起立答辯，表示不能接受莫洛托夫對於英美區合併所提出之結論。渠聲明英美區之合併，原係因波茨坦協定之未曾履行而被迫爲之。美國誠意盼望能履行波茨坦協定關於德國經濟統一之規定，使魯爾區以及德國其餘部份自動由四强共管。貝文亦曰英國力圖實行波茨坦協定之各項規定，然以德國東部區域之反對，因此盟管會竟不克本於波茨坦之精神而行事。貝文繼又述及魯爾所產煤鋼分配之事。謂魯爾之鋼鐵與煤斤，原係由盟管會分配四區，但自蘇代表在盟管會中聲明蘇聯區煤礦之產煤須儘先供給太區及蘇聯當局之需要，加有剩餘始可分配四强以後，英國始停止將魯爾煤產分配四國，其後蘇聯區之其他物產尤其是糧食等，亦莫不依照蘇代表所聲明之辦法辦理，因此德國西部區域遂不得不採取相同步驟。</p>
<p>蘇聯重視賠償問題</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十二日廣播；蘇聯代表今日召開外長會議在蘇京展幕以來之第一次蘇方記者會。據蘇聯外次維辛斯基稱：蘇聯若不能自現行德國生產中獲得賠償，則決不接受任何對總和約。渠力言和約之無賠償，實等於人之缺乏心臓。如賠償問題並無協議，則必將增加西方强國與蘇聯間之困難。</p>

<h3>赫爾利指責美外交政策</h3>
<p>謂其達背大西洋憲章</p>
<p>〔中央社辛辛納提十一日合衆電〕美前駐華大使赫爾利本日談稱：自貝爾納斯赴雅爾達以至辭職期間，除原子彈之管制外，蘇聯獲得一切國際方面之要求。美國在外交方面，放棄美國領袖所稱爲之作戰之一切原則，美國在雅爾達同意違犯大西洋憲章規定，而雅爾達以後各種違犯憲章行爲，均獲美國外交方面之同意，例如美國在歐亞領土方面對蘇聯所作之讓步，及美國在太平洋區之支持法荷帝國主義，均可證明美國漠視大西洋憲章。</p>
<h3>英蘇修約談判</h3>
<p>一時不能商獲具體結果</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十一日電〕英蘇兩國代表本日舉行第三次會議，討論修改兩國盟約問題。據此間政界人士談稱：英國建議內容係依照英法盟約之規定，但在蘇聯方面則贊成將雙方所負之義務，以明文加以確切之規定，與法蘇盟約初無二致，惟本日會議，仍屬初步性質，故在莫斯科外長會議期內，不致商獲具體結果云。</p>

<h3>土報揭破蘇陰謀　戰時曾欲使保國攻土</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城十一日電〕烏魯士報頃載稱：蘇聯於一九四一年初曾企圖使保加利亞進攻土耳其，並許以色臘斯東部讓與該國，作爲該國對土宣戰之條件。當時希特勒曾致電供諾魯總統，表示德國不進攻土國。至於英法土三國互助公敘，附有秘密條款，規定英法兩國應以價値二千五百萬鎊之軍備畀予土國，但至一九四一年英國並未履行此項條款。以言蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在安全理事會發言，攻擊土國在戰時採取親德政策，此種說法，不攻自破。此外土國政府對於戰時所採取之政策，將發表聲明云。</p>
<h3>南國搬走特港義財產　美向南提出抗議　謂此舉實屬非法有損該區經濟</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜在記者招待會上稱：美國政府爲南斯拉夫移運特里埃斯特自由區內現由南軍佔領部份內之義大利財產事，已向南斯拉夫提出嚴辭抗議。抗議書內指出此等財產之移運，並未得義大利原主之同意，亦無合法手續或對原主之賠償。被移運者，有工業財產及供應品等。此舉不但非法，且足損害該區之經濟。艾克遜謂：該一抗議書於三月二十七日即送達南斯拉夫駐美大使，迄無答覆。艾氏復透露爲南斯拉夫法庭宣布戰時沉沒南斯拉夫所控制水道內之義船九或十艘爲戰利品一事，美國亦已於二月十七日提出抗議，良以根據義投降協定及盟國間之協議，此項船舶，應由盟國決定分配辦法，不能由南國單獨宣布爲其財產故也。</p>
<h3>紐西蘭議會　商未來政府形式</h3>
<p>頗有加入美合衆國可能</p>

<h3>華萊士演說　希望英國審慎持重</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十一日電〕美國前副總統華萊士今日在此間「新政治家與民族一週報所發起之座談會發表演說，重新批判杜魯門總統之中東政策，據稱英國若能拒絕參加美蘇二國間任何一方，世界大戰即可避免。該週報乃英國工黨左翼份子反對現政府外交政策之喉舌。華氏並稱：「貴國若能表明途徑，全世界進步民族均將爲強力聯合國機構及世界進步之原則大聲疾呼，爲時非晚。余不信本月或下月將有戰爭，但確信如果聽任現行政策繼續，則今後數月內必將產生一種堅固骨架，不斷支持心理戰，嗣後引起美國之不景氣，終於召致世界大戰。蘇聯方面亦然。就短時期言，對蘇強硬政策頗奏成效。就長時期言，謂能協助和平，余實不解」</p>

<p>〔路透社日內瓦十一日電〕中國首席代表駐比大使金問泗博士在此問國際貿易會議致辭，力言在穩定一般經濟狀况以前，必先减低關稅。渠謂中國代表團之意見，大致可歸納如下：（一）在國外具有出口市塲而國內生產機構正全力生產之國家，對關稅談判之成功，應較經濟較不發達之國負擔更大責任；（二）談判時，一國所提出及所獲得之讓步，應以得以平衡爲原則。但於測量任何國家所爲之犧牲時，應以該國經濟發展之程度，必須解決之戰後復興問題以及是吾已有低度關稅等爲準。</p>

<p>陜北訪問散記之二　北行途中　　經過了一天的汽車搖　黃昏，在耀縣住下了。耀媲依山傍河風量頗佳。河的東邊有火車站，在陝北小縣當中　縣就算是繁華地區。　　天晚訪梁專員談了不少的話，他是湖南人，中等身材，軍人風度，誠實而爽快。總縣在過去兩月前曾一度吃緊，有三個鄕鎮屬共軍管轄，牧復馬欄時，才也被收復，但政令軍令尙不能達到全面，共軍小股在境內時有出入。據他的估計，洛河流域以西，共軍總數約在三四千人左右，結集於黑水寺附近一帶，但共軍士氣極低，不堪一擊。　　馬欄在耀縣北六十華里處，原屬宜君境，共軍盤據後，改爲關中軍區中心，稱馬欄市，設有專員公署，關中軍區司令部，人口亦增至三四千人，兒童多受其蒙蔽，十二歲以下的兒童，尙不知國民政府的名稱。馬欄原爲關中各縣烟土走私的總批發處。但在國軍克復之後，並未發現烟土，僅有民屍六十七具，皆係北軍認爲「有問題」的人，在撤退前槍決。馬攔現有一個辦事處，將來可能設立設治局，人口現有八九百人，市容已漸次恢復了。　　耀縣民衆負担，確是驚人，我們曾大略的平均了一下，每人年需一百八十萬元的担承（有生活能力者，老幼殘弱者不在內）。　　耀縣到黃陵　　由耀縣沿河北行，風景很好，山石怪異，桃花一遍山開，尤其是在金鎖關附近更是美妙，行走在高山之間看着古壘殘垣，想着古代的戰爭，使人感慨頗多。　　車到宜君境時，路山河岸上升向山巔，上坡約三里長，車子走上去，頗感吃力，峯頂有姜女祠，據說當年孟姜女尋夫到此，因口渴無法而大哭，哭出一泉水，如今這有個小鎭，名呌哭泉鎭。　　高原頂上，風力甚勁，氣候也冷了許多，路上行人漸漸少起來，和銅川以南路上所見連續不斷的運煤車馬牲口比較起來，冷淸了許多。汽車急馳在羣嶺問，使人感到不適。宜川縣城以北，公路兩側有「自衛隊」士兵保衛，崗哨很密，雖是新雨初晴，但道上塵土很厚。　　到黃陵的時候，已下午四時，本來想趕到洛川，因路上不保險，就停下來了。這是一個小縣，晚七時，就閉了城門，城內沒有旅館客店，只有一家飯館，市面很蕭條，據許縣長吿記者，黃陵共軍割據區已大部收回，正在整理中。　　許縣長吿記者有一次，共軍圍攻我們的自衛隊時，激戰三日，我軍民嚴密守衛，到第三日，我軍民及共軍士兵，皆放聲大哭，聲震天地，當時因雙方目擊遍地死屍而有感於衷。　　共軍在馬攔易手後，行政人員，未離閒該地區，另籌設淳耀（馬欄北四五十里之廟灣）赤水（馬家山）及僞鄜縣（在鄜縣西四十里處之山中）這些都足證明共軍對陝北各地並未死心。　　黃帝陵在黃陵北門外之橋山上，陵雖不大而橋山確是好地方，在黃色的陝北山地中，只有橋山是翠柏滿山古樹長靑。墓前有明碑一塊上書「橋上龍馭」，再前有方亭一座，是三十三年建的，下有蔣主席手書「黃帝陵」大碑一座，高約七八尺，因爲不久要掃墓，險園附近已佈有電話。陵園山角下，有黃帝祠，內有古柏一株，據說是黃帝手植，其粗爲「七圍又八掌半」下有碑一方，看起來眞是古趣盎然。　　碉堡綫內外　　洛川北四十里處，就是碉堡綫這裏，曾有十餘年的對抗，當記者過時，戰爭摧毀的工事顯而易見，路邊的小鋪，多不見了門板，田地間也少行人，許多村落僅有幾個老弱殘幼，還有兩三處主人全不知上何處去，屋中如今駐紮着由國中各縣　來的自衛隊，記者詢問他們　「共區」尙有多路，他們都相視無言，錢而搖一下頭，說：「不知道」！　　到交通鎭，就算是進入「邊區」了，街上彈痕纍纍殘防尙存，房屋多處被燒，瓦礫盈地。壁上留有「保衛大邊區」之類的標語。記者從廢墟中檢了本共軍的「敎育通訊」好做「戰利品」。再向北行，有多處道路，都被破壞，他們大都是在公路最險處，掘下深塹，但是現在國軍又重築起來了。　　黃昏前抵茶坊，這是郞縣的一個小城，在共軍統制期中，走了紅運，被改爲直轄市，街上發現有鐵軌五十餘根，這都是共軍以前偸來的。交道的防禦工事極堅　，是日本式的，同車的軍官連稍「不壞」。在幾家商店門口，曾發現「妙聯」多付，錄下了二聯：一，學諸葛一生惟謹愼。習澤東創造新民主，二，學林大哈諾夫驚人新紀錄。作布爾塞維克無敵戰鬥員。共軍在宣傳上，眞可謂「見孔即鑽」。　　共軍在撤退前，原計劇燒毀房子，帶走民衆，但是因爲潰退急促，未及行動。在　縣只把城　放倒了，埋了些土製地雷就退走。甘泉就幾乎更急迫，居民大部分多留城內。至於食糧則埋在附近山中，　縣常局與居民，在週內已發掘出匿糧底靑子一石小米三九·四石，包谷二二石及其他食糧多石，現織續發掘，據說尚可掘出許多。　　收復區今天有兩個問總，急　解決，一爲地方武力缺乏，如一旦大軍離境，治安有問題，二是日用器皿及耕牛種籽全被共軍搶走，無法生活，在甘泉縣中，我曾見過三家人合用一口軍用　　流做飯吃，非常狼狽。延安百態  沈維康攝影　　（一）延安安瀾門：居民陸續返城。（二）投誠來歸之共軍保安處司法科長韓繼恩，正向一羣反正之靑年共軍，坦白宣佈過去之錯誤，並闡明今後應如何走向重獲自由生活之道路。（三）延水爲延安僅有之河流，下通黃河。延城居民食用，均賴此水，水流甚淺，涉水可過。（四）國軍與當地民衆，共同建築工事，以防共軍再犯。（五）窰洞近景：內部面積不大，因西北乾燥，故無潮濕之弊。（六）延安大學：舉凡魯大，抗大，均集中於斯。　　勞山的陣地　　由甘泉向前行，公路又是沿河岸而蜿　，一路兩邊沒有發現工事，地裏山鷄甚多，行約四十里後，突然匝面看見高山兩邊夾路，山頭　堡陣地甚多，僞裝頗巧，非仔細留意不易激現。車翻過兩山間非常急陡。　上山又得念下，我們乘的車子忽然拋錨，急轉下去，險遭不測。　　勞山北面的河，水就開始向北流，注入延河，這一帶四面都是峭壁削立，很險要，共軍機槍陣地築在山上，廿四年張學良部剿匪至此，兩師全被共軍解決。古書稱「一夫當關」，勞山確是如此。　　剛到山脚，車又拋錨了，一直停了四個鐘頭。路上的汽車，時來時往，有許多鄕民也三五成羣的走回各自的家鄉，我想在三四個月之後，延安周圍的居民，是會大部回來的，當然這也還需政治上的措施和軍事一樣的令人滿意。　　晚九時，才趕到延安，但已是月在東山，黃錯以後，河中蛙聲頻傳，延安的夜晚是非常安謐的。杭州香汎點滴  五日杭州快訊　本報特派員儲裕生　　西字湖蘇堤白堤上的綠柳是那般的婀娜多姿，當盪舟湖上，遙望經烟萬龍，又像薄薄的綠紗，緊裏着酉子的兩段玉臂。環抱酉子的羣山，浴在和煦的陽光裏，像也被西子所陶醉了。這已是盛春天氣，嬌艷的粉桃，開着誘人的花，逗引着人去欣賞。於是，杭州熱鬧起來了。　　春季大廉價旗號高掛　　三元坊，保佑坊，淸河坊一帶的商店，都掛出春季大廉價的旗號，尤其幾十爿的綢布店，在門前寫着比斗還要大的紅字「加三放尺」，有的「加四放尺」。當踱步過道一條馬路時，置身在紊亂的音樂中，因爲各家店舖都收播着無綫電的音樂，有的紹興載，有的流行歌曲，眞是五花八門。恐怕只有淸河坊王星記，舒蓮記扇子店，和方裕和的南北貨店，翁隆盛茶葉店，大井巷的張小泉近記剪刀店，他們還維特着古風，沒有大吹大擂，尤其是張小泉近記剪刀店，當記者問他們爲什麽不宣傳？他們說：「還是不要宣傳的好，宣傳了，貨色不够賣。增加生產，工人要加工錢，所以還是不宣傳的好。」這爿老店僻處於大井巷的裏面，比起其他的張小泉×記和張小全等的宣傳來，眞是瞠乎其後。　　高掛客滿牌　遊客求宿　　中正路，（即迎紫路）延齡路上，熙熙攘攘。肩摩踵接。入晚，各色各樣的霓虹燈照紅了半天。旅館裏掛出一塊大黑板，上面大書「客滿」兩個火字，有的在「客滿」下還加一個「Full的洋文。賬房先生和老闆們總是嘻嘻的笑着，對後至的客人呌「抱歉」和呌「原諒」。客人們也像住旅館不要錢似的，再四哀求權宿幾晚。因此，有一間房間住了十六個客人，有的客人在三輪車和划子上宿夜，甚至還有的從深晚散步在街衢一直到天明。　　吃到一碗麵　等三小時　　菜館裏生意也特別好，擠得滿滿地，一桌人沒有吃完，新來的客人已候補上了。第二批候補的客人又來了。茶房一再的說：「沒有菜了，魚頭豆腐沒有了，醋溜魚賣完了，搶蝦廚房裏搬光了。做不出來了，做不出來了。」有一位客人說：「我吃一碗麵等了三小時」。　　每天九萬元　划子雇光　　西子湖裏的划子，一共有五百艘，平常日子總有三百多條沒有生意，這一下子，湖濱划船一艘都沒有，被雇一空。一艘划子要價每天九萬元。再少一點，就不是生意經。黃包車和三輪車要價要得很兇，平常一條馬路的路程只要五六百元，現在非二千元不可，少一個子兒再也不肯拉。不久以前，黃包車伕還發生過風潮，他們要求有幾條馬路不准汽車行駛，同時要求减少三輪車。市政府答應了他們的要求，現在他們頗爲活躍。　　丙個口頭禪　抱歉原諒　　出差汽軍公司利市三倍，從湖濱到城站送一趙，要一萬五千一元。到其他的地方，當然更貴了。而且要租汽車，也並不容易，隨便你打電話，或親自去情商，他們都回答你：「抱歉，我們的車子定光了，請原諒」。　　「抱歉」，「原諒」，這兩個名詞，在今天杭州的西子湖畔已成爲漂亮而得意的口頭禪了。　　據城站站長潘銘先生吿訴記者：「每天從上海進口到杭州來的有一萬一千多人，每天由杭州出口的有四千五百人左右。」這樣的計算起來，每人假定每天平均用十萬元，一天要投資到杭州的身上有十一萬萬元，七天就有七十七萬萬元。　　田漢等劇人　談文化城　　田漢先生，同着應雲衛，吳天先生，都來杭州看記者，記者天眞的問他們：「杭州是不是可以成爲文化城？」他們都一致的說：「山水够美麗的了。」在一次歡迎會上，田先生還提出「當劇運衰微的時候，杭州也許是衰微的劇運的救星。」但願如此，可是這也需要有整個的計劃與相當的配合。如果杭州本身不求進步，就這樣的靠靠山水吃飯，那麽杭州永遠不會成爲文化城的·現在浙大師範學院院長鄭曉滄和教授陳立先都一致呌出「杭州應建立文化城」的口號，我們虔誠的希望它早日實現。讀者意見規約　　（一）本欄絕對公開，文自負責。但切忌冗長。（二）切勿攻計私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件槪不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有刪節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，概不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。　　龍華區請補發淡奶　　滬救濟分署發給貧苦嬰孩淡奶每名三罐，吾龍華區十五十六兩保領奶證於三月十九日發出，規定於三月二十日赴梅隴鎭領取，保辦一事處爲體念赤貧「一日不做一日不吃」之艱難，答應代領至莘莊保辦事處憑證分發，庸知屆時該救濟分署工作隊人員，因嬰孩家屬並不親去領取，過時不候，全部車回上海，余不願大好救濟事業，使貧黎向隅，深望分署方面予以補領之機爲幸。（龍華區十五保十七甲三十戶闕永康）交通公司答復讀者　　交通公司答復讀者　　本報於三月二十六日刋出讀者王永萊君建議延長十一路公共汽車路綫一文，頃得上海市公共交通公司籌備委員會函稱：「王君所陳該綫南端應延至小東門一節，頗具高見。惟查外灘自中正東路以南路面狹隘，大型貨車，來往頻繁，各路電車，又極擁擠，實未宜坍加公共汽車行駛，一俟日後該段交通情形轉佳，該路綫當可改由新開河或十六舖爲起點」。特予披露。　　工廠用電請求改善　　編者先生，工廠事業，全賴電力，乃華商電力公司，對於供電區域，本限五日脫一日，今年改）限四日脫一日，在其所轄區內輪流停供，並且規定下午五時至九時，馬達電力，須完全關閉，在此兩限之中，能開工動作，時期無幾，而且限外又復時供時脫，竟至隔日一停，或半日或數時一停，各工廠在此生產能力脆弱開支浩大之時，何堪再受此無形損失，廠商等雖）再請求，亦無效果，迫不得已請貴報披露，促請華商電力公司改善供給工用電力，維護工業，裨益民生，所關殊非淺鮮也。（徐家匯全區各工廠）　　職校學生不宜失學編輯先生：　　閱貴報本月一日敎育版敎育部修正專科學校學籍規則第二項規定職業學校須服務四年後始准投考大學，」一則：不勝感慨，蓋今國家雖已在復興建設時期，然社會秩序未入常軌，失業人數衆多，職業學校學生畢業後，每以無法求得一職爲苦，即或勉強得一噉飯之地，輒學非所用，徒負國家社會造就人材之素旨。不得已，祗能就求學一法，以期深造，今敎部突佈上述規定，則今後勢將陷入失業失學之途，吾等爲職業學校學生，畢業後爲社會服務乃吾等職志。然敎部旣無法代爲謀職，又不准升學，則勢必賦閒家中，荒廢學殖。四年後重升大學事不可能。此其一，此項限制如果實行，職業學校學生勢必瓦解，則往後職業教育誰肯再來，此似又與政府之施行職業敎育方策相衝突，此其二。因此我等提供意見，請教育部在未實行之先，考慮補救辦法，勿使職業學校學生徬徨苦悶。（潘恩溥）　　水管破裂請速興修　　編者先生：本市松潘路周家牌路口一帶，地下水管破裂，自去歲十月間，經該處居民一再通知自來水公司修理，未予照辦。該處無論晴雨，多是一片汪洋，步履維艱，故請貴報予以被露，促市政當局迅轉自來水公司早日興修。（鄭斌）代郵　　復張維光君：來函對令壇收戶口表費有所呼籲一則，頃得江蘇省民政廳復稱：「已飭金壇縣政府查明核辦報奪矣。」特復。　　浙江路公民：大函已轉市警察局查究。新市鎭黃六順君：來函已轉德淸縣政府核辦。　　（自左至右）劇人田漢（第一人），吳天（第三人），應雲衛（第四人），與本報特派員儲裕生（第二人）在本報杭州辦事處側留影。（虞士揮攝）</p>

的所在，也許有所發見。車夫聽了鶴見命令，立即把車子順勢彎到南京路口，華懋飯店大門對面停下：下車開門的當口，竟自動把早晨眼見的情形，略略指出。　　「隊長，請在車裏坐幾分鐘，部下到飯店裏借打幾個電話…」　　「行…。」鶴見點頭，重以鑽到車裏。自由談「尚武精神」  高武弘　　我們這個文弱之邦，大槪是在提倡「尚武精神」吧？日來打風瀰漫，東也打，西也打，你也打，他也打，大家都好像患着「肝腸上升」症，動不動就大打出手，打個明白。警察與榮軍衝突，駐軍與學生交惡，軍人和報館相　；……諸如此類的「打」案，鬧得烏煙　氣，不可開交，翻開報紙來，常常可以「恭讀其盛」。　　這「打風」蔓延到教育界，竟演出了學生搗毀報社的奇聞。國立邊疆學校學生百餘名，本月八日由滬返錫，抵站後，因補票問題與　　發生糾紛，翌日無錫人報即刋載此項新聞，「有聞必錄」，這原是報社的職司，即使有「傳聞失實」之處，當事人也應循正當途徑，向報社當局申述原委，補陳事實真相，請求更正，纔是正理。邊疆學校師生看了人報所刋關於他們的新聞，大為不　，九日下午四時許，有該校教員二人至人報社交涉，要求更正道歉，這樣也就算了，那知「莘莘學子」們集合一百多名，分趁卡車兩輛，「浩浩蕩蕩」的開到人報社，不管先去的教員「交涉」是否成效，竟一聲呼「打」，將該報的營業部，曁機器，鑄字，排字房等攜個精光，并毆傷經理及工友二人，歷時十餘分鐘，「任務」完畢，纔算「揚長而去」。　　無錫報社的「流年」似乎不大吉利，去年錫報和大錫報，因了一條新聞而被軍官總隊學員搗毀，結果由前第一綏靖區司令官湯恩伯賠償損失；而今人報社又因一條新聞而被邊疆學校的學生搗毀。撫今追昔，未免使人憤慨，「新聞自由」不想造成了這樣的結果。　　這件事固不論誰是誰非，但身為學生，竟因一時之怒而搗毀報館，這總是中國教育界的怪現象；即使咎在報社，學生也可據理交涉，獲得合理解決，這種野蠻聚眾兇毆的手段，豈像是身受「高等教育」的大學生所為？　　現在一般人都寄希望於下一代人，學生們應該知道自重自愛，變更一下作風，清一清大家的耳目。禁政與棺材  濤鳴　　鴉片之被當作舶來品輸入中國，已經一百多年了。說它是「希客」，未免太無常識；說它是「熟人」，也不免太見外了；好，索性就承認它是我們祖宗一脈相傳下來的嫡親人吧。試問現年廿五歲左右以上的年輕人的父輩們，有誰不曾呼嚕呼嚕的和它伴榻而眠過。　　為禁煙，林則徐曾經慷慨激昂的向道光帝上過書，自然那是前清的事情了。時代進入民國以後，政府當屬又手定過六年禁煙計劃；勝利以後的民國三十五年三月廿日，又有上海市禁煙協會的成立，發了宣言，公佈了理監事的名單。我說這些，不過是為了證明煙毒即使在今日的中國，還依然在蔓延為害而已。堂皇的禁煙禁毒的佈告宣言發多了，而不切實執行，最多也不過為檔案櫥增加負担而已；嗜煙如命的人見慣了這些佈告和宣言，最多也不過在吞雲吐霧之餘，陰陽怪氣的嘰咕一聲，「哼，老調調又唱響了。」幾十年來，似乎我們就從來沒有倖見過法令的力量，能達到那個點着紅燈的陰暗的角落裏去，而撲滅了尋幽靈似的火花。　　用於禁煙名下的支出，已經不算少了，可是隨着時代的「進步」，和為了適應新的客觀事實的要求起見，請看：　　〔本報丹陽通信〕縣府為表示決心禁絕煙毒起見，一日下午特備棺木二具，一置雙井巷口，一置賢橋上，使吸毒者觸目驚心　　中國事就這麼難辦，單說這禁煙一項，就投了好多資本上去。花錢花鈔票姑且不算，反正那是些無生命的銀銅紙頭而已，可是那些死在「鴉片戰爭」裏的人命卻不能不呌人說是太不值得了吧；而前些時，西康又發生了中國人和中國人打的「鴉片戰爭」，由此諸位當可發現我大煙王國子民的「拼死命，保煙燈」的流血精神了吧。說句老實話，「死」之一字在煙君子國是向例不被人重視的，從煙榻走向棺材，這過程原本就極其自然，更何況棺木之備，只不過僅限於「驚心」而已哉。年齡  棧我　　一個男子去問他所想念的一位小姐多大年紀。　　「我十八歲。」她答　　後來這男人出外經商，兩三年沒有見過到她。　　而在這幾年裏，他蝕了本。　　當他回來的時候，他又見到她，這位小姐忘了兩次曾經見面的。競說：「我才十七歲哪。」　　這男人一聽便流淚哭起來。小姐問他為何以如此，他說：「你的年齡正和我的資本一樣，越來越少，怎不令人傷感呵！」影譚「月黑風高」  無邊　　一個盜犯李靜從牢獄裏放出來，為了生活，他又重新預備再幹老本行，之間他做了一次夢，夢裏他連續的殺了他的兒子，同夥及同學，又引誘了同學的妻子與霸佔了財產，并意圖姦污他的女兒，終於在警探圍捕下，跳樓自殺。至此夢醒了，他那分別了五年的妻子兒女趕來接他，便大團圓結束。　　這樣一個故事先不去講它的真實性，單說這個盜犯李靜身上就找不到人性，故事中他不是個變態者。他過去的幹着搶劫勾當是為了生活。而現在劇中嗜殺成性的行為，實在找不出一些心理上的根據，可以說完全是編劇者指使着他這樣亂幹，只為了構成一連串的恐怖與暗殺事件。尤其荒謬的是編劇者按排的殺人毒素，竟裝在自來水筆中去殺人，事後無法發現這是被毒死的，可是李靜只是個普通的盜犯，他不是個專家，不說這種毒藥是否能有，即使有了，也不可能讓一個普通人在藥房裏隨便買到，那末這毒藥是從那裏來的？　　如果抽掉了李靜手裏的法寶-裝着毒藥的自來水筆，這個故事簡直就無法發展，至少從影片上看來，李靜是靠了他的素藥才能橫行不法的。但是每個觀眾會明白，這是編劇者從西片中抄襲來的，而又用得笨拙無比。因為中國社會中還沒有這樣的事情。　　再說那個工程師的太太，知道了李靜是殺死她丈夫與女兒愛人的兇方，而不投報警局逮捕他，即使不為了替丈夫報仇，為了自身與兒女的安全，她為什麼能够如此容忍，放縱着李靜為所欲為？而她又不是個壞女人。這些是非常不近情理的。　　這應該是一張分析犯罪情理的片子，而導演屠光啟弄錯了，卻把它當作了恐怖片來處理。所以在演出上顯得不倫不類，旣不够恐怖，多餘浪費的鏡頭，也舉不勝舉，但片子依然奇短，僅演七十五分鐘。　　張琬的吳映雪是全劇中最好的一個演出，王丹鳳卻一無可取之處。藝文壇　　田漢·應雲衛·吳天·卜少夫等春遊杭州。杭州劇人協會，浙江省劇詠團等聯合舉辦歡迎晚會於杭塲青年館，到戲劇文化界及學生三百餘人。席間田漢講「此次來杭之感想與今後劇運之道路，」應云衛講「從事戲劇之回憶，」并附報告此行覓取編製電影題材與選擇拍外景地點。吳天講「戲劇之真實性」卜少夫講「今後中國新聞事業之展望。」會後求田漢簽名者甚眾。　　新中國劇社已由台返滬，刻寓居虹口，近擬在江南地區內流動演出。　　第二次美術茶會定十五日下午二時假座紹興路四十七號警社舉行。論李文忠之負謗  慕陶　　岳武穆之言曰：文死諫，武死戰，故明代之臣，恒以犯顏直諫，得受廷杖為榮。夫廷杖，虐政也，若楊椒山等，固大節千古，而其他毛舉細故，或因當爭而諫者，亦不知凡幾。延至清代，此風久而勿替，若李文忠之負謗，亦其一也。當時輿論，咸以文忠為漢奸，故有滑稽者製一聯曰：「揚三已死無崑丑，李二先生是漢奸。」更有一聯，連帶涉及翁松　者曰：「宰相合肥天下瘦，司農常熟世間荒。」平心而論，文忠久任北洋，對於外交，尚是有世界眼光之人，若春秋責備賢者，只可云慈禧將海軍費移造頤和園，不能以去就爭，確是文忠短處，然誰秉國鈞，實非文忠一人應負其責，即使諫而不聰，文忠奉身而退，其自為謀則得矣，於國家有何益哉？至於甲午一役，則中　必欲傾合肥，不惜舉國家作孤注一擲，若張季直，文芸閣輩，只知取媚欔要，囂囂然竭力主戰，豈知合肥雖為所傾，而清社從此動搖矣。不有甲午，何至有戊戌，不有戊戌，何至有庚子？此等名士，其居心只為一黨之爭，欲叢謗於文忠一人之身耳。而天下滔滔，從此多事，有清所失，不過一姓之天下。而民生從此水深火熱，伊誰之咎？日寇之八年搆禍，擾亂我國家，塗炭我民生，推原禍始，何莫非甲午一役為導火綫耶？危城記  秦瘦鷗　　「天下人管天下事。說出來大家聽聽好不好？」不料老祝還是嬉皮笑臉的；彼此相隔不到兩尺，他竟一些沒有害怕的神氣。　　徐太太真是名符其實的雌老虎。此刻正當她發威的時候，對於輕捋虎鬚的人，自然是不肯饒過的。一聲「放屁」，右手向前一揚，就想打老祝的左頰；可是老祝的手眼都比她快，一舉手便把她抓住了。她想改用左手也不成，同樣給對方抓了個緊；老祝悶了好半天的氣，爽快趁此用足手勁，在她兩個手腕上箍了兩下。　　「死人！殺千刀！」出生以來第一遭碰到敵手的徐太太又是氣，又是痛，急得雙腳亂跳，不住口的高聲大罵！　　老祝倒依然是笑容滿面。　　「好了！老祝，快放手！快放手！」徐胖子可急壞了，忙着滾下石級來，哭喪着臉向老祝竭喊。　　「放不得！我一放她還是要打我。」老祝哈哈大笑地說。　　「死人！你這個天殺的！我今天跟你拼了！」徐胖子一上前，他老婆便愈覺今天的事有關自己威信，決不能向老祝善罷干休，便越發殺豬似的狂呌起來，身子幾乎要望地上滾。　　徐紹明急得儘喊：「老祝，壓手！壓手！」　　「祝先生，請你放手吧！這樣不大好！」蘭也走上來勸解。　　這時候的祝兆年，倒也頗有縛虎容易縱虎難之感。他已曾親眼目擊過幾次徐太太的熱烈勇武的表演，知道自己的手一鬆，徐太太必然會把整個身子都撲上來，扭住自己拼命的；但又不能永遠這樣僵持下去。他沒有辦法了，祇能爽快大大的得罪她一下，暗暗一用勁，向外奮力一推，同時雙手鬆開，讓大跳大嚷，臉漲得通紅的徐太太手足披離的直摔到三尺以外的園地裏去。　　這一下可把徐胖子嚇得魂魄皆飛，他像滾一樣的奔過去，急着想把他的寶貝太太扶起來。　　「死人!交得好朋友！我跟你拼命！」不料這位太太不但不領情，反把所有的忿怒全遷到了他身上去，一把抓緊了他的夏威夷衫前胸，像扭鍻糖似的把他縷了個緊。　　「太太！太太！」徐胖子又不敢還手，只一味哀　似的狂呌。（四）（二）𨁸含趨講席育讀閗高聲種亦曾為此而今日發生  子愷</p>

<h3>Chairman and Madam Chiang Arrive in Shanghai from Hangzhou; Inspect Youth Army Before Returning to Nanjing; Korean Leader Syngman Rhee Arrives to Seek an Audience</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:20 PM yesterday aboard the Meiling Special Plane. Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen and his wife, former Premier Song Ziwen, Municipal Government Secretary-General He Dekui, Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, and Director Tao Yishan, among others, arrived at the airport around 4:00 PM to welcome them. Chairman Chiang, in military uniform, looked energetic. Upon disembarking, he repeatedly nodded and greeted the welcomers, shaking hands with Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, and former Premier Zhu. Madam Chiang, wearing a red-bottomed, black-flowered cheongsam under a coat, greeted the welcomers in fluent English, appearing very pleased. Chairman Chiang and his wife then immediately drove to the official residence on Dongping Road to rest. The accompanying staff of the Chairman arrived on two separate planes, including Car Affairs Bureau Director Yu Jishi, Political Affairs Bureau Director Chen Xizeng, Secretary Cao Shengfen, and Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian. According to Secretary Cao, who told reporters: Chairman Chiang and his wife took a plane from Hangzhou to Jianqiao at 3:30 PM yesterday. After arriving at 3:50 PM, they went to the Air Force Officer School to address all the students, encouraging them to abide by discipline and study diligently in order to build China's new air force. After the speech, he met with the heads of various departments and bureaus of Zhejiang Province and the chairman of the provincial party headquarters at the military academy, making inquiries and giving instructions. They took off from Kuanqiao at 4:40 PM to Shanghai. As for the Chairman's trip to eastern Zhejiang, in addition to visiting his hometown after a decade of separation, the main purpose was to inspect Yu Mausoleum. He originally planned to go directly to Shaoxing from Xikou, but due to inconvenient transportation, he took the route through Hangzhou. Yu Mausoleum originally had a scale, but due to years of disrepair, many parts were in ruins.

<h3>Zhang Qun and Zhang Junmai to Pay Respects to the Chairman Today; List of Members of the Political Affairs Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party to Be Proposed Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Standing committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party and government representatives maintained contact throughout yesterday.

The list of political affairs committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party can be proposed in two or three days. Regarding Liang and Zhang's letter of questioning, Jiang believes that it is an individual opinion, and Hu Haimen does not intend to reply publicly, so this matter will not cause a split within the Democratic Socialist Party.</p>

<h3>Far Eastern Commission Subcommittees Begin Discussing U.S. Proposals; Final Decision on Japanese Reparations to be Made</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] The Far Eastern Commission began discussing U.S. proposals today to make a final decision on Japan's post-war industrial level and Japanese reparations. Currently, discussions are limited to subcommittees. Once the subcommittee work is completed, a plenary session will be convened. The plenary session is currently scheduled for next Thursday, but there are signs that it may be held earlier. Delegations from the eleven countries remain silent about the U.S. proposals, generally awaiting instructions from their governments. Meanwhile, Harrison, director of the Reparations Affairs Office of MacArthur Headquarters, and Leidt, director of the Industrial Office, arrived here today from Tokyo to discuss reparations issues with the Army authorities. The nature of the discussions is unknown, but it is said to be related to the U.S. actions in the Far Eastern Commission today. Another official at MacArthur Headquarters said here that the reparations issue is expected to be resolved quickly. This issue is not as important as restoring Japan's industrial health, which is the headquarters' focus.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Allocates Huge Sum to Aid Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the relief of the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese in Palembang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to allocate CN¥648 million, equivalent to 180,000 Dutch guilders, to be remitted to East Indies for relief purposes.

<h3>Greening of Zhangjiakou Project Begins</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 12th] The project to green Zhangjiakou City and transform it into a modern city outside the Great Wall has now begun. A large number of laborers are working daily, earning 7,000 yuan a day as work-for-relief. However, in addition to the 3.4 billion yuan in labor costs, the 1.5 billion yuan needed for materials has not yet been secured. Currently, only projects that do not require materials, such as digging ditches and building dikes, are being carried out.</p>
<h3>Siam Immigration Law Postponed; Ambassador Li Requests Increase in Our Immigration Quota</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 11th Dispatch] It is confirmed that the Siamese government's quota immigration method, originally scheduled to take effect on April 1, has been temporarily postponed after our ambassador to Siam, Li Tieh-cheng, requested the Siamese government to reconsider the allocation of quotas for Chinese immigrants and the date of implementation. According to Ambassador Li, the quota of 10,000 Chinese immigrants per year is based on statistics from the past 20 years, which is unfair, as the number of Chinese immigrants in the latter half of the 20 years was insignificant due to the Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast. Under normal circumstances between 1927 and 1937, the average was 18,000 people per year. This number would be reasonable as the annual quota for Chinese immigrants to Siam. It is reported that in addition to requesting an increase in the quota, Ambassador Li also suggested extending the date of implementation, as the immediate implementation of the new method would cause great difficulties for those already en route to Siam.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Affairs Designates 30 Cities to Evaluate Wages</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, regarding the wage portion, in addition to the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, which have been designated by the Executive Yuan as places for strict price controls, all workers' wages calculated according to the cost of living index are restricted to the cost of living index of January of this year as the highest index, and factories quantitatively distribute six kinds of goods in kind, including grain, cloth, fuel, oil, salt, and sugar, compensating for the difference between the price in January of this year and the current month's price. For other important places where goods in kind have not been distributed, the implementation methods for evaluating wages have been announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan. The locations for evaluating wages have been designated by the Ministry of Social Affairs and presented to the Executive Yuan as 30 cities, including Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wuhu, Anqing, Guangzhou, Shantou, Guilin, Wuzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kangding, Guiyang, Kunming, Changsha, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping, and they are ordered to establish wage evaluation committees separately to consider the price of major daily necessities at that time and place (rice, coal, oil, salt, cotton, cloth, sugar) to make evaluations on wage increases or decreases. If a labor-management dispute evaluation committee has been established in the above locations, the task of wage evaluation will be concurrently handled by the committee, without the need to establish a separate organization to avoid duplication. As for the industries in Nanjing and Shanghai that do not calculate wages according to the cost of living index and do not have factories that can distribute goods in kind, when there is a need to evaluate wages, the labor-management dispute evaluation committee of each city will refer to the implementation methods for evaluating wages to make evaluations.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Undertakes Economic Construction; Uses Overseas Chinese and Foreign Capital to Implement Five-Year Plan; Gives Priority to Farmland Water Conservancy to Increase Grain Production</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th] Governor Luo Zhuoying of Guangdong recently told reporters that Guangdong's Five-Year Construction Plan has now been implemented, but funding is a problem and overseas Chinese and foreign capital should be used as much as possible for development. When he was in Nanjing, he consulted with various Chinese and foreign people, who were very willing to assist in the implementation. Currently, the American Pan-Asia Corporation, which intends to invest in Guangdong's construction, and its person in charge are meeting in Shanghai. The plan has been instructed by the central government, that as long as there is no conflict with local industry and commerce, a contract can be signed in accordance with the Company Law. Luo continued to say that Guangdong will be an economic center rather than a political center in the future, that everything will be done in accordance with central laws and regulations, focusing on economic construction, and that the government will do its utmost to solve the urgent needs of the people. Therefore, in the grain-deficient province, the primary focus is on farmland water conservancy construction to increase production. According to the current plan, grain production in the province can be increased by one-fifth in three years and one-quarter in five years. In addition, the province has rapidly restored the education system, which has been commended by the central government.

<h3>An Impressionistic Record of Northern Jiangsu (1) Two Worlds: Inside and Outside the City</h3>
<p>— Reporter Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu, this vast plain, is still filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood. The people are living in dire straits, their lives only marginally better than pigs'. Those who are alive are being tormented beyond endurance in the cracks. It is difficult to find even a trace of a smile on anyone's face here. Even a small child's expression is so serious, an unnatural phenomenon that makes them seem ten years older.</p>
<p>As we set foot on the highways of Northern Jiangsu, the first thing that catches our eyes is a series of circular pillboxes. The construction materials for these many structures were all dismantled and moved from the destroyed homes of the people.</p>
<p>Around Dongtai, there is also a "new Great Wall" stretching seven li in length. The foundation, two or three zhang thick, appears quite solid. On the one hand, this can be said to represent the crystallization of military-civilian cooperation. But on the other hand, it is also sufficient to indicate that, aside from some points and lines, it is still difficult to achieve true pacification in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>In any county town in Northern Jiangsu, although there is an atmosphere of peace and prosperity, as you approach the city gate, you seem to fall into another world. Layers of barbed wire, the front filled with fortifications, and soldiers with live ammunition, in twos and threes, guarding the pillboxes. This scene is so desolate and tense, so absolutely incompatible with what you saw in the city just moments before. What you see before you is only a stretch of azure sky, set against a pile of gray rubble. The pleasant mood from just a moment ago will immediately be washed away completely!</p>
<p>I remember that on the day we arrived in Rugao, the common people swept the streets clean to welcome the press corps. But we heard that when it was recovered last year, the countryside outside the city was littered with corpses, and even three months later, the stench was still unbearable. These terrifying phenomena are still deeply engraved in everyone's minds and cannot be swept away.</p>
<p>By chance, we managed to steal an hour of free time from a series of visits and receptions to sneak out of the city to take a look. Here, without exception, pillboxes and barbed wire became the only decorative items. We chatted with the daughter of a store owner in a small grocery store by the roadside. This dramatically small shop was also a "three-dynasty veteran." We talked about puppet currency, then anti-Japanese currency, and then national currency. With such repeated exchanges, this grocery store, which was originally quite large, has become a small cigarette and paper shop. The store owner's daughter was originally a student at Rugao Girls' High School. Because she had received secondary education, on the one hand, we could communicate clearly, and on the other hand, her perspective could be more profound. So we talked more and more vigorously. She said with a wry smile, "The burning and killing in the war are certainly the direct disasters suffered by the common people, but the repeated changes in the currency system are the fatal blow to the vast majority of the people." She also said, "The purchasing power of the people is so pitifully weak now. Take my small shop as an example. With a turnover of ten thousand yuan a day, the money earned is not even enough to eat porridge." Coincidentally, across the street was a pork shop. Because Rugao is a place that produces pigs, the price was relatively cheap, with the market price being 2,800 yuan per catty that day. I asked her if they could eat meat every day. She smiled, her face blushing, and said, "How could we? It's hanging in front of our eyes, not in our mouths!"</p>
<p>We ended our conversation amid her bitter laughter. When we stepped out of her shop, we both had heavy hearts.</p>
<p>At a small street corner, we saw another common person from the countryside being stopped by a checkpoint. He took out a temporary pass from a tattered cotton-padded coat, with a two-and-a-half-inch headshot pasted on it. Of course, there was nothing wrong with it, but that photo was definitely not as "sweet" as those displayed in the windows of Shanghai photo studios, but rather a mournful face, a dull head. Below the pass was the signature of a township chief, with the effective period written above, for only three days.</p>
<p>The checkpoint was staffed by a police officer, a soldier, and a female inspector. They inspected the passing villagers and townspeople in a tripartite manner, feeling the upper body and pinching the lower body, working very carefully.</p>
<p>In the countryside here, we rarely see a dog. Some say the dogs have been eaten by people. But some believe the dogs have all starved to death.</p>
<p>A farmer told me that he tilled three mu of land for others in the suburbs. For a family of five, what they harvested was not enough to eat. Usually, they relied entirely on carrying manure for others to earn some money to barely make a living. I asked him: Are the taxes in the countryside high? He said helplessly, it's not fixed, it depends on the township chief.</p>
<p>When we returned to the city, someone advised us not to run around outside the city. The reason is that there is no "peace and tranquility" here.</p>
<p>The darkness of night brought an even greater sense of terror. The city had no electricity after nine o'clock, the streets were under curfew, and sentries were loudly demanding "passwords" from a distance. Bayonets were mounted on rifles, hiding in dark corners, startling people. Fortunately, the people in the city were used to it. If nothing happened, they closed their doors at six o'clock and went to bed early, leaving behind only a city as dead as death.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Sino-American Relations</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the death of former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Seeing the divided opinions at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and hearing the speech delivered by former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace in London, all the more made us mourn the death of this great international political diplomat. We dare to boldly assume that if this great leader were still alive, using his wisdom as a political diplomat, and working with political diplomats from other countries to jointly create a lasting peace in the post-war world, it would not have led to the current tense situation. Therefore, President Roosevelt's passing was not only a great loss for the United States, but also a great loss for the entire world. Looking back and looking forward, it is not difficult to prove that today's world particularly needs a great figure like President Roosevelt to come out and lead the world, so that the post-war world, riddled with holes and sores, can embark on the path of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that today's world not only has little hope of entering a new era of peace and democracy, but the entire world is in a tense situation; the crisis of a new war is lurking everywhere, with the possibility of breaking out anytime, anywhere. We make this statement not to deliberately spread alarmist rumors, but our true intention is to awaken the attention of the political diplomats of the great powers from the standpoint of a third party, and to use their political wisdom at any time to turn the tide before it is too late. But how can this current world crisis be overcome? As the saying goes, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, there can of course be many different methods; different paths lead to the same goal, to achieve the same purpose. We will leave aside all other methods and claims for the time being, and first make a fair comment on the statements and claims made by Henry Wallace since his resignation.</p>
<p>Wallace's claim of "One World" and his strong statement that the United States and the Soviet Union must cooperate fully are in principle unanimously agreed by peace-loving people in all countries, especially Wallace's speech in London the day before yesterday, saying that "if the United States cannot reach an understanding with the Soviet Union, then a third world war will be inevitable," is even more to the point. Not only do we completely agree, but the U.S. diplomatic authorities also hold this view. Looking at American diplomacy in the past year, it can be said that it has always sought the understanding of the Soviet Union. Britain has tried every means to conclude an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, which is even more obvious; but this appeasement policy of blindly pleasing the Soviet Union has not only failed to promote diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, but the mutual suspicion and fear between the two sides has intensified, resulting in the current deadlock that cannot be broken. Therefore, Wallace's claim is not a question of "yes" or "no" in theory, but a question of whether it can be done in reality. For example, Wallace said: "Since President Roosevelt's death, the United States has lost its qualification for leadership, so some countries in Eastern Europe have taken actions to split the world into two worlds, which was supported by the Soviet Union. This is an obvious fact. The U.S. government not only did not make doubled efforts to maintain the unity of the world, but allowed it to split, and thought that war was inevitable." From this general conversation, it can also be seen the reasons for the world's division into two worlds today: first, Roosevelt's death caused the United States to lose its leadership qualification in the international arena; second, the Soviet Union supported the separatist actions of Eastern European countries; and third, the United States failed to make doubled efforts to maintain one world. From this, it can be seen that Wallace's one-sided attack on the U.S. government's foreign policy cannot be considered to have sufficient reasons, and can only be regarded as a kind of fault-finding by a frustrated politician against the government.</p>
<p>Standing on the standpoint of a third party, and calmly observing the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of the war, the most important reason why it has presented a situation of being close and estranged is that there are two decisive forces, which are evenly matched, but sometimes fluctuate up and down. After the war, the United States and the Soviet Union, having learned the bloody lesson of the last war, both deeply knew the horror of war. Especially in the age of atomic energy, if another war breaks out, mankind will only destroy itself, so they felt that peace was particularly lovely. Therefore, everyone's desire for peace is the centripetal force that leads the United States and the Soviet Union to "unite" after the war. However, the United States and the Soviet Union are two completely different types in terms of ideology, and in terms of practical interests, they are in an incompatible position. For any international issue that arises after the war, the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are always diametrically opposed, and they cannot be compromised or reconciled. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union, whether in Europe or in the Far East and the Pacific, have friction everywhere. Therefore, ideological differences and conflicting interests are the centrifugal force that leads the United States and the Soviet Union to "separate." The ebb and flow of these two forces form the close and estranged relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, which also creates the uncertainty of the world situation.</p>
<p>Precisely because the United States and the Soviet Union still have common ground, everyone desires peace. The Soviet Union requires engaging in material construction in a peaceful atmosphere, enriching the socialist country, so that it can truly guarantee its survival and not worry about foreign aggression. The United States also wants the world to recuperate in a peaceful environment, creating universal peace and prosperity, so that the United States' industry and commerce can have a way out. So that the United States, at any cost, can obtain some compensation for participating in this war. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union, despite their different ideologies and conflicting interests, will eventually find ways to cooperate and jointly maintain world peace, so that both countries can benefit. It has not been two years since the end of the war, and in this short period of time, I don't know how many international conferences have been held. Taking the current Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference as an example, from beginning to end, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union have been contradictory. Why did Molotov and Marshall engage in a tireless war of words, and have such good patience? Everyone still wants to discuss a compromise solution. Otherwise, they would have broken up unhappily long ago. Therefore, the reason why the United States and the Soviet Union still maintain normal relations and have not fallen into a split is also here. However, we cannot overestimate this centripetal force, otherwise we will make the mistake of being overly optimistic. Moreover, the centrifugal forces created by various factors cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The first is the difference in ideology. The United States is a capitalist country, and the Soviet Union is a communist country. Not only are they ideologically opposed to each other, but they also have different views on any term. For example, the peace and democracy that the United States and the Soviet Union jointly desire are also viewed differently. The world peace that the Soviet Union desires is a world peace under the leadership of the Soviet Union. Similarly, the peace that the United States desires is also a world peace under the leadership of the United States. Moreover, the methods adopted by both sides are different. The Soviet Union wants to consolidate the world peace it leads by expanding its "security zone," while the United States relies on the secret of atomic energy, world bases, and the power of dollar diplomacy to maintain world peace. As for the American and Soviet conceptions of democracy, they are even more different. The Soviet Union once criticized British and American-style democracy as 18th-century democracy, while the British and Americans called Soviet-style democracy totalitarianism.</p>
<p>The second is the conflict of interests. Although the United States and the Soviet Union generally have the same opinions on any issue in principle, conflicts occur everywhere in actual interests. Whether it is dealing with Germany or controlling Japan, although there is no objection in principle, the opinions are very different on the implementation methods. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was deadlocked for this reason.</p>
<p>The third is suspicion and fear. The United States suspects that the Soviet Union is expanding its power everywhere and establishing an "iron curtain," destroying the American so-called principles of freedom and democracy; while the Soviet Union suspects the United States, which is unwilling to announce the secret of atomic energy, and is exercising its dollar diplomacy everywhere, and all the economic aid to anti-Soviet countries is a threat to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the two sides are suspicious of each other, and the fear is intensifying, making it impossible to eliminate.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the centrifugal force between the United States and the Soviet Union is growing day by day. If today's international political diplomats cannot use their wisdom in time to turn the tide before it is too late, then the future consequences will be unimaginable. We certainly hope that American political diplomats will use their wisdom to restore the spirit of mutual trust and concession between the United States and the Soviet Union; however, the elimination of suspicion and fear cannot be eliminated by the vigilance of one side; if the Soviet Union's attitude cannot be changed, Wallace's proposal, no matter how ideal it is, is still a kind of impractical empty talk with little possibility of realization. Therefore, we want to loudly appeal to the political diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union: Use political wisdom to eliminate misunderstandings between the two countries, now is the time.</p>
<h3>All Circles in Xinjiang Raise Demands to Improve Transportation Between Beijing and Dihua Zhang Zhizhong Promises to Convey to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 12th] What bothers all levels of staff serving in Xinjiang the most is the obstruction of transportation between the Northwest and Beijing. It takes months for letters to travel back and forth. The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes flying between Beijing and Dihua have recently suspended service for reasons, while Northeast Airlines and the China-Philippines and China-Thailand air routes have been planned and opened one after another, giving the people of Xinjiang a very poor impression. It is reported that people from all walks of life here have asked Zhang Zhizhong to resolve the following issues: (1) It was previously reported that the Shanghai-Xinjiang route would add eight flights per month, which was approved by Chairman Chiang and ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be handled by CNAC. Why has it not been implemented yet? How can state-owned transportation agencies break faith with the people? (2) The opening of the China-Philippines and China-Thailand air routes is because they are international transportation routes, but how can the country value foreigners over its own people and ignore the demands of the people in the border areas? (3) The opening of the China-Philippines and China-Thailand routes is obviously because they are profitable, while the Shanghai-Dihua route requires losses. State-owned agencies should benefit the people. How can they ignore it if it is not profitable? This is certainly not the intention of the central government. Although Xinjiang is a remote province, it is part of Chinese territory. The country's transportation policy should seek balanced development. It is heard that Zhang has promised to convey the requests to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications for answers.</p>

<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Formally Proposes Four-Power Co-Management of the Ruhr Area Unwilling to Decide on the Saar Issue Immediately Heated Debate on the Issue of Territorial Merger</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Moscow, 12th [broadcast]: Today, the Foreign Ministers Conference completed its discussion on the future political structure of Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] Molotov opposed the French proposal to separate the Ruhr and Rhineland regions from Germany at today's Foreign Ministers Conference. He said that the goal of the proposal was to decompose and liquidate the German state, which the Soviet government found difficult to agree to. The German people should not be deprived of their country, as this move would drive the German people to become enemies and throw themselves into the arms of "avengers and militarists." He believes that four-power control of the Ruhr area during the occupation period is indispensable for European security. Regarding the French request to merge the Saar into the French economy, Molotov stated that it still needs further study. Molotov then criticized the merger of the British and American zones of Germany, saying that as a result of the merger, the Ruhr area had been controlled by the two allied countries, but the Soviet Union and France were still not involved, which was an extremely abnormal arrangement. After the British and Americans merged their two occupation zones, they effectively divided Germany into eastern and western parts and began to decompose Germany, thus destroying the political and economic unity of Germany. The Ruhr must be placed under four-power co-management in order to serve the interests of Europe, as Marshall and Bevin claimed yesterday. Regarding the Allied countries' other land claims against Germany, Molotov said that he had not had time to study them one by one, so he was not prepared to offer opinions for the time being. Secretary of State Marshall stood up to respond to Molotov immediately after he finished speaking, stating that he could not accept Molotov's conclusion on the merger of the British and American zones. He stated that the merger of the British and American zones was forced by the failure to implement the Potsdam Agreement. The United States sincerely hoped to implement the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the economic unity of Germany, so that the Ruhr area and the rest of Germany could be automatically co-managed by the four powers. Bevin also said that Britain was trying to implement the various provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, but due to the opposition of the eastern region of Germany, the Allied Control Council was unable to act in the spirit of Potsdam. Bevin then mentioned the distribution of coal and steel produced in the Ruhr, saying that the steel and coal in the Ruhr were originally distributed to the four zones by the Allied Control Council, but since the Soviet representative in the Allied Control Council stated that the coal produced in the Soviet zone must be supplied to the zone and the Soviet authorities first, and the surplus could be distributed to the four powers, Britain stopped distributing the Ruhr coal to the four countries. Later, other products in the Soviet zone, especially food, were handled in the same way as the Soviet representative stated, so the western region of Germany had to take the same steps.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Emphasizes the Issue of Reparations</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Moscow, 12th [broadcast]: The Soviet representative held the first Soviet press conference today at the Foreign Ministers Conference since it opened in the Soviet capital. According to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, if the Soviet Union cannot obtain compensation from current German production, it will never accept any overall treaty. He emphasized that a treaty without reparations is equivalent to a person lacking a heart. If the issue of reparations is not agreed upon, it will inevitably increase the difficulties between the Western powers and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic visited U.S. Secretary of State Marshall today. It is believed that Simic made demands for the cession of Carinthia province and compensation from Austria.</p>
<h3>The Only Achievement of the Foreign Ministers Conference Reveals Some Secret Agreements</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Moscow, 12th [broadcast]: The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference concluded five weeks of debate today. Starting next week, it will enter its sixth week. The only achievement of the Foreign Ministers Conference in the past five weeks was the revelation of some secret agreements. Secret clauses such as Yalta were mentioned every day in the five weeks. As a result, the U.S. government had to publish the correct content of some secret clauses. So far, the following have been revealed: (1) In the secret Yalta clauses, Roosevelt and Churchill both agreed to obtain compensation from current German production; (2) In the secret Potsdam Agreement, Attlee and Stalin agreed not to obtain compensation from Austria; (3) Bevin, Byrnes, and Stalin made some decisions on the German-Polish border issue in secret talks in Potsdam. The British and Americans now claim that the borders decided at that time were only temporary, while the Soviets insist that they were permanent; (4) President Roosevelt advocated dividing Germany into five states at the Tehran Conference, but Churchill advocated dividing it into three states at the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>Ma Qing Clarifies America's Policy Towards Korea; Hodge Resolves to Implement It; Promoting the Resumption of US-Soviet Joint Commission Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Asia East News Agency, Seoul, 12th] Lieutenant General Hodge, through the Press Office, issued the following statement regarding Secretary of State Marshall's two communications to Molotov:</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall's letter to the Soviet Foreign Minister expresses the United States' attitude toward Korea and the implementation of the decisions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and urges the reopening of the US-Soviet Joint Commission. If the Soviet Union does not accept the recommendations put forward in Secretary of State Marshall's two communications, the United States will establish a provisional government in its occupation zone to assist Korea in resolving its various difficulties. In other words, the American military in southern Korea will independently promote the upward development of South Korea's politics, economy, and culture, and strive for the development of democracy.</p>

<p>Families of the "Fu Bo" Warship Officers and Men Appeal</p>
<p>Demanding Punishment of the Culprits, Compensation, and Bereavement Benefits</p>
<p>If a Concrete Response Is Not Received, They Will Jointly Petition in Nanjing</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Request to Release Dai Rulin Is Rejected</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Liaison Committee of the families of the officers and men who died in the "Fu Bo" warship disaster yesterday afternoon hosted the press to appeal, believing that the captain of the Hai Min transport ship, Ru Lin, did not immediately stop the ship to rescue after the accident, but instead attempted to escape, which is tantamount to intentional homicide, and has violated Article 128 of the Maritime Law and Item 1 of Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, they appeal to the public to uphold justice and provide support. The committee also stated that it has put forward three demands: "(1) Punish the Culprits: Dai Ru Lin's failure to rescue is unforgivable. The Hai Min ship continued to sail and attempted to escape after colliding with and sinking the "Fu Bo" warship. This is confirmed by the passengers of the ship, and the fact that only one of the hundreds of officers and men on the Fu Bo ship was rescued also proves this. The judicial authorities should impose the death penalty to uphold the law and appease public anger. (2) Compensation: The officers and men of the Fu Bo who died in the line of duty were cultivated by the country in difficult times and were the support of our families. We are heartbroken after the tragedy, but the China Merchants Bureau, from the standpoint of the perpetrator, has not made any expression. Moreover, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Xu Xueyu, was leisurely sightseeing in West Lake while we were running around and wailing, disregarding the lives of hundreds of people. This is the ultimate disregard for humanity. Now that our families, orphans, and widows are in dire straits, the China Merchants Bureau, as the perpetrator, should immediately bear the responsibility for compensation. (3) Bereavement Benefits: Our Fu Bo warship officers and men died in the line of duty. In addition to sending personnel to comfort the families, the Naval Headquarters has not yet clarified the steps for handling bereavement benefits. However, in view of the cumbersome nature of general bereavement procedures and the delay in time, the naval authorities should expedite the preferential treatment and not be perfunctory."</p>
<p>Liaison Committee representative Yu Yiping and others also stated: If a concrete response is not received in the short term, they will take joint action and petition the relevant parties in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters, Gao Rufeng, stated that Dai Rulin, the captain of the Hai Min ship that collided with and sank the Fu Bo gunboat, has been detained by the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office and will be investigated according to law. He urged all family members of the victims in various places to quickly contact the First Department of the Nanjing Naval Headquarters in writing at their respective locations to apply for bereavement benefits, so as not to travel back and forth to Shanghai and waste money.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Ruiqing and 21 other members of the Liaison Committee organized by the families of the officers and men who died in the Fu Bo tragedy yesterday jointly submitted a request to the District Prosecutor's Office to strictly investigate Dai Rulin, the captain of the Hai Min ship, and requested continued detention and no bail, so as not to increase the difficulties during the investigation. At the same time, Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, also submitted a document requesting the release of Dai Rulin on bail. The handling prosecutor, Cao Hong, reviewed and rejected Xu Xueyu's request.</p>
<p>Opposing the Railway Bureau's Freight Business Office; Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Transportation Industry Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Passing a Resolution to Organize a Joint Business Promotion Association</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Transportation Business Association yesterday afternoon convened a joint meeting in the auditorium of the Shanghai Forwarding Industry Association. Chairman Guo Shaohou reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that since the Railway Bureau established freight business offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou last year, the transportation industry's business has been taken away.

<p>Suspicion of Malpractice in the Sale of Cotton Cloth at Auction</p>
<p>Concluding Arguments; Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Pan Shufan, former deputy director of the Municipal Government Property Management Office, Xu Jingbo, chairman of the Welfare Committee of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Liao Gongshao, director of the General Affairs Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, being suspected of engaging in private malpractice during the sale of cotton cloth at auction, which was secretly ordered by Chairman Jiang to be thoroughly investigated, was heard for the third time yesterday in the District Court. Pan testified: Since taking office as deputy director of the Property Management Office, everything has been handled under orders, and there has never been any malpractice. Xu Jingbo and Liao Gongshao also stated that they did not consider the repurchase of cotton cloth to be an act of malpractice, but purely to raise funds for the welfare of the police, and not for personal gain. They also stated that at that time, they repurchased 1,000 pieces from the winning business, Rongmao, at a price of 50,000 yuan per piece, and the payment for the cloth was made by the accounting office of the Municipal Police Bureau with a check and approved by Deputy Director Yu. The court also summoned Zheng Jing, the director of the accounting office of the Police Bureau, to testify, proving that the payment for the cloth was indeed paid by the accounting office with a check. Li Guangzhong, the person in charge of Rongmao, was also questioned, and he testified that he did not know any of the defendants Pan, Xu, and Liao. He went to bid because he saw the bidding announcement of the Property Management Office. There was no private malpractice during the bidding, and he requested an investigation. After the defense lawyers for the defendants presented their arguments, the court ordered that the sentencing be announced on the 18th, and the three defendants each remained on their original bail.</p>
<p>Change of General Manager of the Executive Yuan Water Transport Team</p>
<p>After the Executive Yuan Water Transport Team was entrusted to the Jin Yun Office for agency management, the Jin Yun Office hired Huang Jiaqiu as the general manager. Recently, due to Huang's repeated apologies and resignations, the Executive Yuan appointed Colonel Annas, the executive director of the department, as the general manager the day before yesterday, and Huang served as a consultant. Annas officially took office yesterday. The Water Transport Team currently has a total of 263 ships, transporting repair equipment and other items, with a total value of more than 19 million US dollars. Among them, 81 ships are worth more than 50,000 US dollars each. The ownership of these ships still belongs to UNRRA, and the Executive Yuan is only borrowing them. Therefore, the final disposal of these ships is still subject to UNRRA's decision. The Executive Yuan hopes that UNRRA can donate these ships to our country and sell them to shipping companies at a price to develop the shipping industry. The number of ships allocated to the Water Transport Team by UNRRA has reached 95% of the total, and the remaining 5% are barges, which are on their way to China.</p>
<p>In addition, the Water Transport Team has been established for nearly a year. According to statistics, it has carried out approximately 200,000 tons of materials before and after. The amount of materials transported last month was particularly large, totaling more than 27,000 tons.</p>

<p>The Only Son of the British Prime Minister, Little Attlee, Is in Shanghai</p>
<p>Without Enjoying Any Nobility or Privilege, He Works as an Apprentice Sailor on a Transport Ship</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Feature] Martin Attlee, 19, the only son of current British Prime Minister Attlee, works as a basic apprentice sailor on the Blue Funnel Line's Calchas. The Calchas set sail from Liverpool in early February to China and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. This is Little Attlee's first visit to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In Britain, the son of the Prime Minister, like the son of a worker, is an ordinary citizen on an equal footing. Little Attlee did not enjoy any privileges because his father was the Prime Minister, and he is not interested in his father's career. His ambition lies in the vast and great ocean. Therefore, after graduating from a regular school, he specialized in navigation and worked on several ships in Canada. This time, he came to China with the Calchas, and his job is to wash and sweep the deck.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter specifically crossed the Huangpu River from Yangshupu to visit this "Prime Minister's Son" sailor. Walking windingly from the Blue Funnel Wharf onto the ship, I saw the crew members working busily, and I didn't know which one was Little Attlee. After repeatedly inquiring, thanks to a familiar sailor, he led us to Little Attlee's bedroom, but he was not there. With great difficulty, we searched around the deck again and saw a person walking from the stern in the distance. The sailor who led us to find him pointed and said, "He's coming."</p>
<p>Covered in Grease and Dirt</p>
<p>Looking Like a Blacksmith's Apprentice</p>
<p>Little Attlee, to put it bluntly, looks exactly like an apprentice just out of a blacksmith shop or a worker out of a machine room. He wears a blue-edged white-topped peaked cap, a gray work suit, bare feet in sandals, and is covered in grease and dirt. He holds a broken straw rope in one hand and a cigarette in the other, tall and leisurely, probably just finished work.</p>
<p>A Shy Lad</p>
<p>After hearing us express our intentions, he looked quite shy. He said that he was going ashore to play football at four o'clock, so he could only talk for a few minutes. (It was almost four o'clock.) He told us that there were three sisters at home. He has been interested in sailing since he was a child, and his father, Prime Minister Attlee, also agreed to his participation in shipboard work. After coming to Shanghai this time, he has not yet visited the city, and the Calchas is leaving Shanghai on Monday, and the only remaining day, Sunday, happens to be his shift, so he is about to miss the opportunity to visit Shanghai. He looked quite regretful.</p>
<p>Deeply Touched by a Pair of Hands</p>
<p>Little Attlee spoke very gently and kindly. We took a picture of him on the deck (see picture). He put his hands on his waist and looked very happy. I think he is very satisfied with his work.</p>
<p>At four o'clock, I reached out to shake hands with him, but he pulled his hand back and opened his rough palm to show me. He said, "Too dirty." Indeed, the palm was full of black filth - the sacred achievement of work. This is a typical sailor's palm, and also a noble Prime Minister's son's palm. I was deeply moved. On the way home, I kept thinking about the sons of those dignitaries in our country.</p>
<p>Conscription Survey Can Begin on the 20th</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Office Completes New Military Section Organization</p>
<p>Candidates for the Heads of the Security Divisions in Each District to Be Announced</p>
<p>In order to assist in handling conscription in the city, the Municipal Civil Affairs Office has added a military section to preside over the planning of the conscription survey. Yesterday, Yao Wenying, the chief of the section, said that since being ordered to take office, the internal organization has been completed, and three divisions have been set up for security, training, and conscription. The conscription survey will begin on the 20th of this month because the various forms are not yet printed. In the initial stage, the conscription of those aged 22 to 25 will be surveyed first according to the central government's regulations, and a list will be re-prepared based on the registered household in the city. The district offices have decided to add security divisions to preside over the handling of conscription. One director will be appointed for each of the 30 districts in the city. The candidates for director have been recommended by various floors, and all will be announced next week. Each bao in the city will have a bao squad leader (i.e., assistant), and these talents must have military knowledge and have served in the military. The section has also begun to register them, and many are being recommended by various military agencies, reaching more than 600 people. Among them are 300 youth army soldiers who can be fully employed.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Can Afford to Compensate for Transportation of Japanese Reparations Materials</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter recently inquired with Shen, deputy manager of the China Merchants Bureau, about the preparations for transporting the first batch of 400,000 tons of materials from Japan as reparations to our country. The bureau has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Communications. He said: 400,000 tons is a small amount, and the bureau's existing ships are sufficient to meet this need at any time. Shen pointed out that the primary work of receiving reparations materials includes dismantling, hoisting, and packaging, which must be fully prepared in advance, and transportation is secondary.</p>
<p>According to officials, all kinds of workers needed to receive reparations materials in Japan in the future can be hired locally in Japan, and there is no need to hire workers in the country to transport them to Japan, saving labor and expenses.</p>
<p>Preparations to Receive Reparations Ships</p>

<p>More Than 30 Incense Shops Are on Strike</p>
<p>Many Disputes in Various Industries Due to Refusal to Issue Differential Allowances</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] More than 30 incense shops, including Yongxinzai and Jinhuazhai, have been on strike since the 7th due to the differential allowance issue. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the employers to issue the differential allowance and ordered the employees to resume work immediately.</p>

<p>Another Wave of Rice Hoarding Cases</p>
<p>Police Officer Jailed for Accepting Bribes</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the hoarding of rice at the Gongyi Rice Shop at No. 932 Hengshan Road. Recently, the police bureau suddenly discovered that Jin Zhongliang, the manager who had been at large, had entrusted businessman Hu A'di to bribe Zhong He, the section chief of the Xujiahui Police Station, with 12 dans of white rice, worth 6 million yuan in legal tender, to seek the release of the detained employee Guo Jinhang.

<p>Sorcerer Kills</p>
<p>After a marriage proposal failed, the murderer is sentenced to life imprisonment</p>
<p>The little craftsman Li Deyang, 29, was passionately in love with his cousin Chen Fengxian. Last year, he proposed to Chen, and although Chen agreed, Chen's father refused because the fortune teller said that the "eight characters" of the two did not match, and ordered his daughter to alienate Li. Li held a grudge and on the morning of March 3 last year, carrying a small leather knife, went to Chen's home at No. 117, Lane 409, South Second Road, to propose to her again. He said that Chen had fled to Hangzhou, and she did not agree. Li then threatened her with a knife. Chen called for help in a panic, and Li stabbed her in the throat, causing her to be injured and die. The murderer was later arrested by the police and sent to the District Court for trial on charges of murder. The case has been tried several times by the District Court and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye pronounced the sentence in the Third Criminal Court: "Li Deyang is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, deprived of civil rights for life, and the leather knife is confiscated." After hearing the sentence, the defendant cried non-stop and was immediately escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<p>Traffic Interrupted on Xikang Road</p>
<p>A Large Team of Police Captures Bandits</p>
<p>Anti-Theft Drill Is Realistic</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 7:58 PM last night, the duty room of the Putuo Road Police Station received a report from the No. 3 Road telephone police post that five bandits had broken into a department store at No. 596 Xinzeng Road. Three were wearing long gowns and two were wearing short clothes, holding two wooden-shell guns and two pistols. Qi Jingzhi, the director of the branch, was in charge of the command, with Zhu, the section chief, as his deputy. He immediately assembled nine groups of police officers, each group consisting of a mix of security police, plainclothes police, auxiliary police, and administrative police, with more than 400 people. Each group armed and set off quickly to block the main roads. As a result, the auxiliary police officer No. 2464 arrested a bandit, Tan Tu, at the intersection of Changshou Road and Xikang Road. Plainclothes police officer Shen Jinyao chased and arrested a bandit on Xinhui Road. Plainclothes police officer Yang Bingsheng arrested a bandit in the middle section of Xikang Road, and auxiliary police officer No. 2159 chased and arrested a bandit on Anyuan Road and Xikang Road. Another bandit was arrested by auxiliary police officer No. 1145 at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road. Two wooden-shell guns and two pistols, as well as a package of stolen goods, were seized on the spot. It was later learned that it was an anti-theft drill held by the Putuo Road Police Station. During the drill, the shops along Xikang Road were filled with police sirens, traffic was interrupted, and the police officers acted quickly, and the situation was extremely realistic.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Forged Qin Tile Han Brick Chamber Talk Seal   Li Baifeng   Small Preface   The category of seals has passed through the Three Dynasties. The harmonious guidance and carved inscriptions still show rudimentary forms. Nearing the Han Dynasty, public seals flourished, mostly cast in bronze and jade, taking the meaning of talisman scripts. By the Tang and Song Dynasties, signatures and seals gradually became popular, flourishing in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Wang Yuanzhang changed the material to flowered talc, and seal studies extended to private individuals. When Wen Peng and He Zhen emerged, they initially revived the fading practice but did not break free from established patterns. Ding Jing, Deng Shiru, and others expanded it further, emulating the wise. The realm of seal studies became broader. Western seal engravers followed, numbering in the thousands. Hui Shu’s delicate and ingenious style marked an initial distinction, and the source became visible. However, the Xu brothers of Feihong Hall failed to integrate knife techniques, merely imitating appearances, preserving only the dregs in their carvings. This trend spread widely, leaving harmful effects everywhere, misleading naive beginners onto wrong paths, creating a clear distinction like that between the Jing and Wei rivers. In recent times, though there are scholars with broad knowledge, none have been able to strongly criticize its flaws. Furthermore, published works on seal engraving lack specialized treatises to correct later learners. Occasional simplified writings also lack insightful views, generally mixing things together without end, plagiarizing old theories, with minor perfections and major flaws mutually dependent. They cannot ascend to the realm of art, nor can they soar into the world of literature. Therefore, I present my shallow knowledge and humble opinions. I cherish even my worn belt. Carving is originally a minor skill, yet it can be comprehensively discussed by thousands of households. Removing the superfluous and redundant, I willingly accept self-deprecation. However, after the ravages of war, my collection of books was long consumed by fire. I can only offer a limited view, presenting my humble opinions and presumptuous words, fearing to mislead future learners. I humbly ask scholars both domestic and overseas to not be stingy with their teachings, so that I may avoid the fault of self-praise and not be unworthy of this era. My evaluations are based on no models. My discussions of knife techniques and composition strive to meet aesthetic conditions, to establish correct aesthetic concepts through meaning. As for ancient simplicity and elegance, I still follow the ancient masters, to open up a broader path for the future.   Intention and Composition   A Qing dynasty gentleman, Zhang Jun, said: "Intention precedes the brush, the knife does not move rashly; using abundant skill, grasp the true spirit beyond appearances." These words are indeed worthy of deep reflection for seal engravers. I have often seen vulgar seals in the market, claiming to emulate the Qin and Han Dynasties, or copying bronze vessels and tripods, or striving to imitate the Wan and Zhe schools, or privately admiring Ding and He... Most are upright and straight, planned with rulers, becoming mere craftsmanship. Even the smallest strokes show signs of contrivance. This is a great mistake.   Although seal engraving is a minor art, its strokes and undulations must be full of ancient meaning. This also strives to meet the conditions of "pictorial beauty," only then can it be called a masterwork. Therefore, composition is the most important thing in seal engraving. Ancient people discussing painting said: "In sparse areas, horses can gallop; in dense areas, not even a needle can be inserted." This can also be used as a reference for seal composition. I do not need to be like Mr. Qi Baishi, who "knew not of the Han Dynasty," but I also cannot be entirely occupied by the ancients. In general, the composition of the seal (that is, the arrangement of the characters) should contain a slightly decorative, artistic flavor. This is the superior approach.   According to our country's art, importance is placed on composition. Paintings have both sparse and dense areas, and Han seals also distinguish between composition. There are many discussions on this topic, but those who can possess unique ingenuity are only the venerable Cang Lao, Baishi, and Hui Shu. In earlier years, I saw Yang Zhongshou, Shigong, and others uniquely create blank spaces on the seal surface, their composition far more advanced than their predecessors, but their refined art was appreciated by few, becoming rare treasures. Even those who followed had insufficient brushwork and weak knife skills, merely pursuing superficialities. Others, such as Wu Nanyu and Ning, are either known for pleasing the vulgar or for deceiving the world with their reputation, sticking to established patterns, vainly seeking a semblance of the Qin and Han Dynasties, growing further from antiquity. The common saying of "evoking ancient sentiments" has become too ingrained, and the psychological yearning for the complexity of ancient times is even more intense, while our country's inherent artistic traditions have always emphasized "symmetry" and "evenness." Therefore, in the art of seal engraving, prejudices are difficult to shift, and individuals lack aesthetic cultivation, only stubbornly clinging to the outdated patterns of imitating, modeling, and copying the ancients... becoming infatuated with corpses. Seal engravers therefore dare not lightly cross the line.   In the past, when people painted, even a single stone, a single tree, a single person, a single horse, had to be sparsely spaced and artfully arranged. However, in seal engraving, this principle has long been ignored. Although the world places seal engraving alongside traditional Chinese painting, few use strict eyes to decide what to take and what to discard. Only if the lines are not pleasing to the eye and the strokes are evenly spaced is it considered a superior choice. However, even though seal engraving is a minor skill, attention should be paid to the interweaving and embracing of strokes, like flowing streams, sparse and dense, well-arranged. Gaps in the composition are blemishes. I have always advocated integrating new academic concepts into seal engraving composition, but those with shallow learning cannot understand this. Although some people in the late Qing Dynasty occasionally touched upon it, it was all accidental genius, so it was not widely promoted. As for carving and imitating the ancients, everything is upright and even, because in ordinary times, no attention has ever been paid to the idea of "composition."   My advocacy of this proposal may have the awareness of establishing a unique standard. I am not a frivolous youth, and I certainly dare not slander the sages of the past. Judging from my essays and short poems, one can know that I do not intend to belittle the ancients. Du Fu said: "I do not disparage modern men who love the ancients, elegant words and beautiful phrases must be neighbors," treating both ancient and modern people equally. And: "Unable to reach the former sages, there is no doubt, in adopting and following, whom should one precede?" There is also Li Bai's: "The Grand Odes have long not been written, who will present them when I decline?" How could I arbitrarily criticize the ancients? It is also out of necessity. Therefore, when we engrave seals, we must have no ancients in our minds before we can put the knife to the stone.   Only those who understand this principle are qualified to discuss the intention of seal composition; otherwise, sticking to the teachings of one's teacher is merely "re-engraving," not worthy of discussion of creation. How could it be worthy of being placed alongside calligraphy and painting in the arts?   In my opinion, seal engravers should not trivialize this minor art and treat it carelessly. Zhuangzi said: "If you enlarge the great, then nothing is not great; if you diminish the small, then nothing is not small." Seal engraving is indeed a minor skill, but even in the smallest ant, the Dao can be seen. We should not view Zhuangzi as frivolous and unrealistic, and treat it casually.   Using the Knife and the Wrist   Using the knife is like using the brush. This argument is certainly a platitude, but ignoring it has become a habit, losing the flavor of brushstrokes. The common term for seal engraving is "iron brush." Does it have no such meaning? Do today's seal engravers all wield the knife like a brush? I say: "No." The practice is to use the knife like an awl, merely cutting and scraping, unable to wield it like a master craftsman wielding an ax.   A good calligrapher does not discriminate against brushes, and a good seal engraver is not troubled by knives. One should take the central tip. Although the side tip can be slightly modified, the full force of the knife should be used to show the strength of a giant lion capturing a rabbit. I once saw Baishi wielding the knife, making one stroke to the end, never stopping, moving the knife like a giant boat parting waves, stone layers collapsing. Good calligraphers say that strength penetrates the back of the paper. Isn't this the case? Two strokes for one line reveals the marks of an ax. Although a broken mirror can be made round, it is not a flawless whole.   Therefore, the knife should be made of pure steel, especially heavy with a thin blade. The knife should have a flat edge. A beveled edge is powerless. Beginners should not choose the easy route. A flat-edged knife has no reserve power when moving, like writing without a wide brush. Seal engraving, a minor skill, requires the full force of the knife for every stroke and undulation. A giant lion uses all its strength to capture a rabbit; otherwise, the spirit will be lost, and there will be no vitality. Next, at the turning points of strokes, it is best to turn the blade in one stroke. If one wants to insert skills, the charm will be lost. The cracks in seal imitations of bronze vessels and stone tablets are not caused by human effort. The ancient, full-bodied feeling is from stone marks and mottling, like broken steles and ruined tablets, sought out without artificial arrangement.   If the wrist is weak when wielding the knife, the strokes will be uneven, easily damaging the frame. In the smallest horizontal, vertical, and dotted strokes, a weak wrist will result in stagnation and rigidity, tasteless like chewing wax, like a person's shoulders being cut apart by a pure knife. If one preserves the natural, smooth, round momentum, like the jade shoulders of a beautiful woman, round and charming, then the marks of the ax will not be revealed; otherwise, it will fall into stagnation and dullness, lacking elegance. The seniors Baishi, Cang Lao, and Yiting engraved seals, using a forceful, blunt cut, never stopping the blade. Coiled tendons and gnarled branches give it an excellent mystery. Baishi's knife edge is peculiarly strong, powerful, and the knife marks and ax traces are intertwined and dense, like trees with interlaced branches, swords and halberds arrayed, pleasing to the eye, with five colors shining. This also means that in the arrangement of lines and white space, there is still an artistic intention. Later imitations merely imitate the frame, losing the beauty of the interwoven composition, so the charm is gone, the strokes are entangled, and there is no novelty. Baishi's mantle is old and venerable, the golden knife is free and unrestrained, and only with talent and elegance can one establish one's own style. However, compared to Cang Lao, the strength is greater, but the spirit is weaker, still slightly distant, let alone us.   Seal engraving, a minor art, does not have to strive for the gentleness, softness, honesty, and sincerity of poetry, but being too unrestrained in temperament easily leads to crudeness. Li Bai and Su Shi were great talents throughout the ages, but if one's strength is insufficient, and one strives to follow them, one will become like Dong Shi.   Since seal studies fell into the hands of the Fei Hong Tang brothers, the vitality was lost. They sought even and slender strokes, and the edge lines were also deliberately imitating the ancients. The craftsmanship was heavy, and the artistic path was subtle.   Furthermore, when seal art spread eastward, the Japanese even more liked to imitate the Fei Hong Tang style, so their works rarely had good qualities.   The strength of the knife lies in the wrist and is focused on the fingers, just like using a brush. If the strength is purely in the fingers, it will not be able to work on an inch of leather, and the energy will be weak, and the spirit will be fatigued. The problem lies in the fingers. Wang Shaoling's Report in "Literary Tea" China's Artists in America Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>Assistant professor of the Art Department of Columbia University in the United States, Mr. Wang Shaoling, returned to China not long ago, passed through Shanghai, and attended the 24th "Literary Tea Party" after the victory. Mr. Wang was originally an old friend of "Wen Cha": in those years, he not only participated in the Shanghai "Wen Cha," but also hosted another "Wen Cha" in Hong Kong. This time attending the Shanghai "Wen Cha" after the victory, after nine years of separation, his demeanor remains the same, and his studies have made even more progress. The tea friends then asked him to report: "Chinese Artists in America." Zhongnian recorded it as follows.</p>
<p>I stayed in the United States for nine years, first as a student, then as an assistant professor in the Art Department of Columbia University. At present, there are five or six Chinese students studying art in the United States, but I am afraid that only one brother is studying in a specialized department.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Pearl Harbor Incident, a grand Chinese painting exhibition was held in New York: the Chinese-style paintings were all works by Mr. Zhang Shuqi, and the Western-style paintings were my works. Americans warmly welcomed and unanimously praised them. During this period, there was also a political factor: Americans personally suffered from the Japanese, and only then did they understand the true meaning of China's long-term resistance. They had great sympathy for the Chinese people and Chinese culture, and took advantage of this art exhibition to express this sympathy as much as possible.</p>
<p>At that time, there was also Mr. Wang Qingyuan, a Chinese painter in New York.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Zhang Shuqi went to Canada.</p>
<p>Before this, that is, in the early years of China's War of Resistance, Mr. Zhang Shanzi's paintings of tigers were very popular in the United States. Mr. Zhang's tigers were realistic, but they were created with Eastern brushstrokes. Americans were able to understand them because of their realism, and they admired them because of their Eastern colors.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Zhang Shanzi, it was Mr. Zhang Shuqi, and Mr. Zhang Shuqi's flowers and birds were even more popular with Americans. The publicity in the newspapers goes without saying. Before Christmas, everyone competed to buy New Year's cards painted by Mr. Zhang, which shows the love of the people.</p>
<p>The United States is a wealthy country, but it does not have a unique American culture. Americans absorb Chinese culture and also absorb European culture. Museums contain Chinese paintings (ancient and modern) and also contain a large number of French paintings, as well as paintings from other countries. The intersection of Chinese and Western cultures may produce American-based culture in the future.</p>
<p>I just returned from Nanjing; when I was in Beijing, I saw the professors of the Central University living in poverty, which was really heartbreaking! By analogy, it is known that the days of Chinese cultural people are difficult, but after all, the motherland is the motherland. I hope everyone cherishes it, endures hardship, and struggles for it! Viewing the National Woodcut Exhibition Jiading</p>
<p>Although I have never done woodcut, as soon as I heard the news of the National Woodcut Exhibition, I hurried to see it. I want to praise woodcut, because in this exhibition I have seen the brilliant future of woodcut.</p>
<p>Art can never jump out of reality, but should reflect reality and describe life. In China, woodcut has only 15 years of history since Lu Xun advocated it. During the War of Resistance, woodcut gave full play to some forces because it was suitable for environmental requirements. It is precisely because it grew up in suffering, unlike other arts that can be far away in ivory towers, it added a lot of power to the War of Resistance. After the victory, other forms of printing and drawing were restored, and woodcut, like drama, also fell into a low ebb. Some woodcut artists changed careers, and comics gradually replaced the status of woodcut. This exhibition tells us that this idea is a mistake.</p>
<p>The art of woodcut has indeed made significant progress in the year or so after the victory. The lines and composition have given us a new perspective. Especially in terms of content, the woodcut during the War of Resistance praised the sacred War of Resistance and expressed rural life. Now the content is mostly against the civil war, exposing the evils of society, and fighting for democracy. The subject matter did not give up the vast peasant life because many woodcut artists went to the city. The reality of the subject matter and the realism of the depiction can inspire people to a new path.</p>
<p>I love Li Hua's "Internal and External Unity" the most. Anger and power can be expressed. Secondly, his "Leaving Work" has soft and clear lines, and harmonious colors, which gives people a comfortable and peaceful feeling. "The Received Factory" and "The Dark Side of the City" fully express the characteristics of woodcut lines, and the scene matching is also very appropriate. Li Hua was originally an oil painter, and his works also have an oil painting flavor. We have to say that Li Hua has achieved the most and best results in this exhibition, and his reflection on reality is also the most powerful.</p>
<p>The edge of the knife has always been considered superior if it has "metallic quality." The lines are powerful, such as his "For the Sake of Having a Grandson," and Jing Chu's "Hankou Pier" also has the same style.</p>
<p>Among the color woodcuts, in addition to praising Li Hua's works, A Yang's "Welcoming Marriage Picture" and "Welcoming Lantern Picture" have a very Chinese flavor, and Ke Ping's "Returning Late" has an oil painting flavor, bright and beautiful. Those with special styles are like Qiu Xietang's "Embellishment Second Picture," which is carved with parallel knives. The neat lines form extremely beautiful patterns of sea waves and small boats. Zhang Diexi's "Slave Market" is superior in its chaos. Xi Ai's "Spring News" is composed entirely of soft curves, and Man Ping's "Pioneers" is a symbolic painting that brings unlimited hope to people. Ting Jie's "Firewood Gatherer" is set off by dark surfaces, and Mai Gan's "Shaving" uses the simplest knife-carved lines to depict it. Han Shangyi's "Pulling Training" uses earth piles to express strength, and Mai Gan's "Under the Overturned Nest" is entirely an imitation of Chinese painting, and Chen Xiaoxi's "Jiang Feng" is superior in its grandeur.</p>
<p>There are many good works. In this short year or so, we have been able to see so many good works. We should celebrate the future of woodcut. We hope that woodcut can go deeper into reality and become more popular.</p>
<p>Finally, I will record the two sentences I heard at the meeting below:</p>
<p>A foreign-looking person said: "My judgment criterion is to hold down the title below and see if the picture can express its meaning."</p>
<p>Another person said: "Chinese woodcut has not fully utilized the light and darkness."</p>
<p>Whether these two sentences are accurate is up to the woodcut writers to say. Landscape Xie Xianou An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 315 Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After hearing this, Tsurumi asked Masaiwa to reward the chauffeur with a glass of beer, got up himself, took a German-style twenty-shot pistol from his suitcase, attached the magazine to his waist, and prepared to go out. The chauffeur was flattered to receive the glass of beer. He thanked him again and again, gulped it down, and carefully put the glass on the corner of the door, licking his lips and tongue, as if he had received a glass of jade liquid and nectar.</p>
<p>"What do you think?" Tsurumi sent the chauffeur to wait in the car, closed the door again before leaving, and asked Masaiwa like this.</p>
<p>"First, the subordinates think that it is inconvenient to work here, and there are many people and mouths in the department, and it is not a place to work. The director wonders if you want me to prepare an ideal place for you first, as a base of operations."</p>
<p>"Very good, is there such an ideal place?"</p>
<p>"There are many: several large hotels opened by the Chinese are very ideal, and the telephone is also very convenient, especially the International Hotel in the new Concession, which is very quiet."</p>
<p>"Okay, what other suggestions?"</p>
<p>"Second, the subordinates think that Miss Nakamura must have been lured and imprisoned by some enemy. I just can't think of the purpose and goal. Perhaps the captain can figure it out in detail?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's the tricks of Group Two's minions! But it's just a guess."</p>
<p>"Third, should we go to the park to see the corner of the white kimono? Maybe we can ask some truth?" Masaiwa expected that Pingzi's disappearance had nothing to do with the park appointment.</p>
<p>"If there is time, we can do that. But I think that is another matter and has nothing to do with this case... However, we have to find them, maybe it has something to do with the big goal we both have."</p>
<p>"One more thing, the subordinate wants to ask the captain to specify a time, the subordinate can call that friend first: because they are sometimes very busy..."</p>
<p>"Time?... I'm afraid I can't say for sure right now, I'll specify it later..."</p>
<p>In his own room, Tsurumi left a secret code note for Pingzi, explaining his current whereabouts, and told Pingzi to wait for him to come back if he returned to the hotel, and not to move around, etc. This was to prevent Pingzi from returning to the hotel safely and rushing out again.</p>
<p>The two of them, Tsurumi and Masaiwa, were in the car and arrived at the corner of the Bund and Nanjing Road. Tsurumi suddenly ordered the driver to stop. The original goal of their trip was to go to the International Hotel to rent a satisfactory room as a place to work, and they didn't want to stay at the Cathay Hotel at all, but Tsurumi temporarily had an idea to see what kind of place this huge building was, and maybe he would find something. After hearing Tsurumi's order, the driver immediately turned the car to the Nanjing Road intersection and stopped opposite the gate of the Cathay Hotel: at the moment of getting off and opening the door, he automatically pointed out the situation he had seen in the morning.</p>
<p>"Captain, please sit in the car for a few minutes, the subordinate will go to the hotel to make a few phone calls..."</p>
<p>"Okay..." Tsurumi nodded and got back into the car. Free Talk "Martial Spirit" Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>Is our weak country probably promoting "martial spirit"? Lately, typhoons have been rampant, fighting in the east, fighting in the west, you fight, he fights, everyone seems to be suffering from "liver ascending" syndrome, and they fight at the drop of a hat, making it clear. Conflicts between police and veterans, feuds between garrison troops and students, military personnel and newspapers... Such "fighting" cases have caused a smoky atmosphere, and it is impossible to sort them out. Opening the newspaper, you can often "respectfully read its grandeur."</p>
<p>This "fighting wind" has spread to the education sector, and it has even produced the strange news of students destroying newspaper offices. More than 100 students from the National Frontier School returned to Wuxi from Shanghai on the 8th of this month. After arriving at the station, a dispute arose with the train conductor over the issue of supplementary tickets. The next day, the Wuxi Ren Bao published this news, "recording everything that was heard." This was originally the duty of the newspaper office. Even if there were places where "rumors were untrue," the parties concerned should follow proper channels to state the facts to the newspaper authorities, supplement the truth, and request correction. The teachers and students of the Frontier School were very dissatisfied after reading the news about them published in the Ren Bao. At about 4 p.m. on the 9th, two teachers from the school went to the Ren Bao to negotiate, demanding correction and apology. That was it, but who knew that more than 100 "students" gathered, took two trucks, and "majestically" drove to the Ren Bao office. Regardless of whether the "negotiation" of the teachers who went first was successful, they shouted "fight" and carried away the business department, machinery, typecasting, typesetting room, etc., and beat the manager and two workers. The "mission" was completed in more than ten minutes, and then they "left triumphantly."</p>
<p>The "ill fortune" of the Wuxi newspaper office seems to be a bad omen. Last year, the Xibao and Daxi Bao were destroyed by the officers and soldiers of the Zongdui because of a piece of news. As a result, Tang Enbo, the former commander of the First Appeasement District, compensated for the losses. Now, the Ren Bao office has been destroyed by the students of the Frontier School because of a piece of news. Looking back on the past and chasing the past, it is inevitable to make people angry. "Freedom of the press" did not expect to create such a result.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is right and wrong in this matter, it is always a strange phenomenon in the Chinese education sector for students to destroy newspaper offices out of a moment of anger. Even if the fault lies with the newspaper office, students can negotiate according to reason and obtain a reasonable solution. How can this barbaric method of gathering a crowd to fight be like what college students who have received "higher education" do?</p>
<p>Now, everyone generally places hope on the next generation. Students should know how to respect themselves and change their style to clear everyone's ears and eyes. Banning Politics and Coffins Tao Ming</p>
<p>It has been more than a hundred years since opium was imported into China as a foreign product. To say that it is a "rare guest" is too ignorant; to say that it is an "acquaintance" is too distant; well, let's just admit that it is a direct descendant passed down from our ancestors. I ask whose fathers of young people around the age of 25 or older today have not snored and slept with it?</p>
<p>For the sake of banning opium, Lin Zexu once wrote a book to Emperor Daoguang with generosity and excitement, but naturally that was something of the former Qing Dynasty. After the times entered the Republic of China, the government belonged to another six-year opium ban plan. After the victory, on March 20, 1946, the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Association was established, issued a declaration, and announced the list of directors and supervisors. I say this only to prove that even in today's China, the harm of drug addiction is still spreading. Issuing many majestic announcements and declarations of banning smoking and drugs without earnestly implementing them is at most only increasing the burden on the filing cabinet. People who are addicted to smoking have become accustomed to these announcements and declarations, and at most they will grunt in a strange and strange manner after spitting out smoke, "Hum, the old tune is singing again." For decades, it seems that we have never been fortunate enough to see the power of the law reach that dark corner with a red light, and extinguish the ghostly sparks.</p>
<p>The expenditure for banning smoking has not been small, but with the "progress" of the times and in order to adapt to the requirements of the new objective facts, please see:</p>
<p>[Correspondent from Danyang, this newspaper] In order to show the county government's determination to ban drugs, two coffins were specially prepared on the afternoon of the 1st, one placed at the entrance of Shuangjing Lane and the other placed on Xianqiao, so that drug addicts would be shocked.</p>
<p>Chinese affairs are so difficult to handle. Just talking about banning smoking, so much capital has been invested in it. Spending money and banknotes is not a big deal, anyway, they are just inanimate silver, copper, and paper, but the lives of those who died in the "Opium War" have to be said to be too unworthy. And some time ago, another "Opium War" fought by Chinese and Chinese people occurred in Xikang. From this, you can discover the "bloody spirit of fighting to the death to protect the opium lamp" of the people of my Great Opium Kingdom. To be honest, the word "death" has never been valued in the country of opium gentlemen. The process from the opium couch to the coffin is originally extremely natural, not to mention that the preparation of coffins is only limited to "shocking" people. Age Zhan Wo</p>
<p>A man asked a lady he was thinking about how old she was.</p>
<p>"I am eighteen years old," she replied.</p>
<p>Later, the man went out to do business and did not see her for two or three years.</p>
<p>And in these years, he lost his capital.</p>
<p>When he came back, he saw her again. This lady forgot that they had met twice. She said: "I am only seventeen years old."</p>
<p>When the man heard this, he burst into tears. The lady asked him why he was like this. He said: "Your age is just like my capital, getting less and less, how can it not make people sad!" Shadow Talk "Dark Night, High Winds" Wu Bian</p>
<p>A thief, Li Jing, was released from prison. In order to make a living, he prepared to resume his old business. In the meantime, he had a dream. In his dream, he successively killed his son, accomplices, and classmates, seduced his classmate's wife, and seized his property, and attempted to rape his daughter. Finally, he jumped off a building and committed suicide under the siege of detectives. At this point, he woke up from the dream. His wife and children, who had been separated for five years, rushed to pick him up, and the story ended with a happy reunion.</p>
<p>Without going into the authenticity of such a story, it is difficult to find humanity in this thief Li Jing. In the story, he is not a pervert. He used to engage in robbery for a living. But now in the play, his homicidal behavior is really hard to find some psychological basis. It can be said that it is completely the screenwriter who instructed him to do this nonsense, just to form a series of horror and assassination events. Especially absurd is that the screenwriter arranged for the murder toxin to be installed in a fountain pen to kill people. Afterwards, it was impossible to discover that this was a poisoning death. However, Li Jing is just an ordinary thief. He is not an expert. Not to mention whether this kind of poison can exist, even if it does, it is impossible for an ordinary person to buy it casually in a pharmacy. So where did this poison come from?</p>
<p>If you remove the magic weapon in Li Jing's hand - the fountain pen containing poison - this story simply cannot develop, at least from the perspective of the film, Li Jing relied on his toxin to be able to act lawlessly. But every audience will understand that this was copied by the screenwriter from a Western film, and it was used clumsily. Because there is no such thing in Chinese society.</p>
<p>Also, the engineer's wife knew that Li Jing was the murderer who killed her husband and daughter's lover, but she did not report him to the police to arrest him. Even if it was not to avenge her husband, for the safety of herself and her children, why could she tolerate and indulge Li Jing to do whatever he wanted? And she is not a bad woman. These are very unreasonable.</p>
<p>This should have been a film that analyzes the rationality of crime, but director Tu Guangqi made a mistake and treated it as a horror film. Therefore, the performance seems incongruous. It is not scary enough, and there are countless superfluous and wasteful shots, but the film is still surprisingly short, only 75 minutes long.</p>
<p>Zhang Wan's Wu Yingxue is the best performance in the whole play, but Wang Danfeng has nothing to commend. Arts and Literature Circles</p>
<p>Tian Han, Ying Yunwei, Wu Tian, and Bu Shaofu, etc., went to Hangzhou for a spring outing. The Hangzhou Dramatists Association and the Zhejiang Provincial Drama Troupe jointly held a welcome dinner at the Hangzhou Youth Center, attended by more than 300 people from the drama and culture circles and students. During the banquet, Tian Han spoke about "Impressions of this visit to Hangzhou and the future of the drama movement," Ying Yunwei spoke about "Memories of engaging in drama," and also reported on his trip to find and compile film subjects and select locations for filming. Wu Tian spoke about "The Authenticity of Drama," and Bu Shaofu spoke about "The Prospects for Chinese Journalism in the Future." After the meeting, many people asked Tian Han for autographs.</p>
<p>The New China Drama Troupe has returned to Shanghai from Taiwan and is currently residing in Hongkou. It plans to perform in the Jiangnan area soon.</p>
<p>The Second Art Tea Party is scheduled to be held at the Police Agency at 47 Shaoxing Road at 2 p.m. on the 15th. On Li Wenzhong's Slander Mu Tao</p>
<p>Yue Wumu said: "Scholars die in remonstrance, and warriors die in battle." Therefore, the ministers of the Ming Dynasty always took pride in being punished in court for speaking frankly. The court punishment was a cruel policy, and although Yang Jiaoshan and others were great men of integrity throughout the ages, there were also many others who cited trivial matters or remonstrated because they should contend. This trend continued until the Qing Dynasty. Li Wenzhong's slander was also one of them. At that time, public opinion generally regarded Wenzhong as a traitor, so some humorists created a couplet that said: "Yang San is already dead, no Kun Chou; Mr. Li Er is a traitor." There is also a couplet that involves Weng Songchan: "The prime minister's Hefei is making the world thin, and the Secretary of Agriculture's Changshu is making the world barren." To be fair, Wenzhong had been in charge of Beiyang for a long time, and he was a person with a global perspective on diplomacy. If we criticize the wise like in the Spring and Autumn Annals, we can only say that Empress Dowager Cixi diverted the navy funds to build the Summer Palace. We cannot argue about whether to stay or leave. It is true that this was Wenzhong's shortcoming. However, who held the reins of the country? It was not Wenzhong alone who should be responsible. Even if he remonstrated but was not listened to, Wenzhong would retire and take care of himself. He would have succeeded in seeking his own interests. What benefit would it have to the country? As for the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the court had to overthrow Hefei at all costs and did not hesitate to use the country as a desperate gamble. People like Zhang Jian and Wen Yunge only knew how to curry favor with the powerful and clamorously advocated war. How could they know that although Hefei was overthrown, the Qing Dynasty was shaken from then on? If there had been no Sino-Japanese War, there would have been no Hundred Days' Reform; if there had been no Hundred Days' Reform, there would have been no Boxer Rebellion. These celebrities only had the intention of party strife and wanted to heap slander on Wenzhong alone. And the world was in turmoil, and there were many things from then on. What the Qing Dynasty lost was only the world of one family. And the people's livelihood has been in dire straits since then. Who is to blame? The Japanese invaders caused trouble for eight years, disrupted our country, and brought misery to our people. Tracing the beginning of the disaster, was it not the Sino-Japanese War that served as the fuse? Siege Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"The people of the world manage the affairs of the world. Is it okay to tell everyone to listen?" Unexpectedly, Lao Zhu was still smiling cheekily; they were less than two feet apart from each other, and he was not afraid at all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu is truly a well-deserved tigress. At this moment, when she was showing her power, she would naturally not spare those who lightly stroked the tiger's whiskers. With a "bullshit," she raised her right hand forward, wanting to hit Lao Zhu's left cheek; but Lao Zhu's hands and eyes were faster than hers, and with a lift of his hand, he grabbed her. She tried to change to her left hand, but it didn't work, and she was also grabbed tightly by the other party; Lao Zhu suppressed his anger for a long time, and took this opportunity to use all his strength to tighten her two wrists twice.</p>
<p>"Dead man! Kill a thousand knives!" Mrs. Xu, who encountered an opponent for the first time since birth, was both angry and in pain, and she jumped up and down anxiously, shouting loudly without stopping!</p>
<p>Lao Zhu was still smiling.</p>
<p>"Okay! Lao Zhu, let go! Let go!" Fatty Xu was so anxious that he rolled down the stone steps, crying and shouting to Lao Zhu.</p>
<p>"I can't let go! As soon as I let go, she will still hit me." Lao Zhu laughed loudly and said.</p>
<p>"Dead man! You damned thing! I'm going to fight you today!" As soon as Fatty Xu came forward, his wife felt that today's matter was related to her prestige, and she must not let Lao Zhu go. She shouted madly like killing a pig, and her body almost rolled onto the ground.</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming shouted anxiously: "Lao Zhu, press down! Press down!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, please let go! This is not good!" Lan also came up to persuade him.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhu Zhaonian also felt that it was easy to tie a</p>
<h3>Hurley Accuses U.S. Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Claiming it Violates the Atlantic Charter</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Cincinnati, 11th Associated Press Dispatch] Former U.S. Ambassador to China, Hurley, stated today: From Byrnes's trip to Yalta until his resignation, except for the control of the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union obtained all of its international demands. In terms of diplomacy, the United States abandoned all the principles that American leaders claimed were the purpose of the war. The United States agreed in Yalta to violate the provisions of the Atlantic Charter, and various violations of the Charter after Yalta were approved by the U.S. diplomatic side. For example, the concessions made by the United States to the Soviet Union in terms of Eurasian territory, and the support of French and Dutch imperialism by the United States in the Pacific region, all prove the United States' disregard for the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations</h3>
<p>A Concrete Outcome Cannot Be Reached Immediately</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] Representatives of Britain and the Soviet Union held their third meeting today to discuss revising the treaty between the two countries. According to political figures here, the British proposal is based on the provisions of the Anglo-French alliance, but the Soviet side favors explicitly specifying the obligations of both parties, which is no different from the initial Franco-Soviet alliance. However, today's meeting was still preliminary in nature, so a concrete outcome is unlikely to be reached during the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Naval Agreement</h3>
<p>Distributing Remaining Italian Warships</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] The French Foreign Ministry revealed today that the four powers signed a naval treaty on February 10, stipulating the establishment of a committee to allocate the remaining Italian warships according to the Italian peace treaty. The committee is expected to meet in Paris soon. The treaty also stipulates that the Soviet Union will return to Britain one British battleship and several torpedo boats and submarines lent during the war, and the U.S. cruiser Milwaukee will be returned to the United States.</p>
<h3>Final Meeting of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 12th] The final meeting of the League of Nations Liquidation Committee was convened this morning by Norwegian Parliament Speaker Hambro in this city. Our country's representative to the committee, Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Tianxi, is likely to arrive here on the morning of the 14th to attend the meeting. It is said that after this meeting, the former League of Nations will come to a complete end. The Liquidation Committee's report will be published in June.</p>
<h3>Lindbergh Expresses Views</h3>
<p>Endorsing Truman's Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: The famous aviator Lindbergh, who was once an extreme isolationist, has been silent for a long time. Suddenly, he issued a statement endorsing Truman's new foreign policy and advocating the completion of America's overseas goals, even if it requires the use of force. Lindbergh said that the U.S. policy towards Europe is to assist countries with ideas similar to those of the United States. Lindbergh also said: We have destroyed Nazi Germany, but the result is to enhance the strength of the Communist Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>U.N. Relief Ship Carrying Dairy Cattle to China Returns to America Mid-Voyage</h3>
<p>Due to Engine Trouble on the Ship</p>
<p>[United Press, San Diego, California, 12th] The Coast Guard received a radio message today that the ship "Plymouth Victory," carrying U.N. dairy cattle to China, had engine trouble mid-voyage and has now been towed by a U.S. Navy tugboat to near Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. It is expected to be towed to San Pedro Harbor on the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Turkish Newspaper Reveals Soviet Conspiracy: The USSR Tried to Get Bulgaria to Attack Turkey During the War</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 11th] The Ulus newspaper recently reported that the Soviet Union attempted in early 1941 to get Bulgaria to attack Turkey, promising to cede eastern Thrace to Bulgaria as a condition for Bulgaria declaring war on Turkey. At that time, Hitler telegraphed President Inonu, stating that Germany would not attack Turkey. As for the mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and Turkey, it had a secret clause stipulating that Britain and France should provide Turkey with military equipment worth 25 million pounds, but Britain did not fulfill this clause until 1941. In light of this, Soviet representative Gromyko's statement in the Security Council, attacking Turkey for adopting a pro-German policy during the war, is self-defeating. In addition, the Turkish government will issue a statement regarding the policies it adopted during the war.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Moves Italian Property from Trieste: U.S. Protests to Yugoslavia, Claiming the Move is Illegal and Harms the Region's Economy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference that the U.S. government has lodged a strong protest with Yugoslavia regarding Yugoslavia's removal of Italian property from the portion of the Free Territory of Trieste currently occupied by Yugoslav troops. The protest letter pointed out that the removal of such property was done without the consent of the original Italian owners, without legal procedures, or compensation to the original owners. Those removed included industrial property and supplies. This move is not only illegal but also harms the region's economy. Acheson said that the protest letter was delivered to the Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States on March 27 and has not yet received a response. Acheson also revealed that the United States also protested on February 17 the Yugoslav court's declaration of nine or ten Italian ships sunk during the war in Yugoslav-controlled waters as war booty, because according to the Italian surrender agreement and agreements between the Allies, the disposition of these ships should be determined by the Allies, and Yugoslavia cannot unilaterally declare them as its property.</p>
<h3>Newfoundland Parliament Discussing Future Forms of Government</h3>
<p>There is a Considerable Possibility of Joining the United States</p>
<p>[United Press, St. John's, Newfoundland, 11th] The Newfoundland Parliament began discussing future forms of government today, so that the United States can recognize it as its fourth-largest state, and has elected representatives to discuss with the British and Canadian governments within the next two months whether to maintain its status as a British dominion or join Canada as its tenth province. If the United States agrees, it will also elect another delegation to negotiate the conditions for joining the United States. The United States has 99-year lease agreements for bases in St. John's, Argentia, and Stephenville, and is unwilling to abandon them, which will become a major problem. According to Washington telegrams, those familiar with the situation in Newfoundland say that obtaining U.S. statehood is very complicated and will take a long time. According to those in charge, this is interesting news, but no formal notification has been received regarding this proposal.</p>
<h3>U.S. Grain Exports: Can Reach 400 Million Bushels Before May</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that if the current ship tonnage can be maintained, it will be able to complete its plan to export 400 million bushels of grain before May 1. Among them, 267 million bushels are wheat and flour, and 133 million bushels are corn and other miscellaneous grains.</p>
<p>On March 25, a simple ceremony was held on the 63rd floor of the Empire State Building in New York, where the son of U.S. millionaire Rockefeller presented a check for $8.5 million to U.N.

<h3>Truman Delivers Broadcast on Anniversary of Roosevelt's Death, Praising Him as a Great Humanitarian</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Kansas City, 12th] President Truman delivered a broadcast on the anniversary of President Roosevelt's death, praising him as a great humanitarian. Truman said that the tombstone of President Roosevelt at Hyde Park only has the words "Born in 1881, Died in 1945" inscribed on it, but I have seen, heard, and imagined that people all over the world will never forget Roosevelt. This is a very natural reaction from humanity to Roosevelt's personality and character, and it is an echo of sympathy and understanding of suffering for Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Home:</h3>
<p>Visited by 500,000 People</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 11th] The late President Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park has been visited by nearly 500,000 people since it opened last year. This property, including the late president's residence, tomb, and 33 acres of land, was donated to the people of the United States by Mrs. Roosevelt on April 12, 1946, the first anniversary of the president's death. Records show that visitors came from all over the United States and at least 54 other countries. The number of people visiting the tomb on September 1 last year reached 9,837, the highest record for a single day.</p>
<h3>Wallace Speech:</h3>
<p>Hoping Britain Will Exercise Prudence and Restraint</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace delivered a speech at a forum initiated by the "New Statesman and Nation" weekly here today, re-criticizing President Truman's Middle East policy. It is said that if Britain can refuse to participate in either side of the U.S. and Soviet Union, a world war can be avoided. The weekly is the mouthpiece of left-wing members of the British Labour Party who oppose the current government's foreign policy. Wallace also said: "If your country can show the way, it is not too late for all progressive nations in the world to call for a strong United Nations organization and the principles of world progress. I do not believe there will be a war this month or next month, but I am sure that if the current policy is allowed to continue, it will produce a solid framework in the coming months that will constantly support psychological warfare, subsequently lead to a recession in the United States, and finally lead to a world war. The same is true for the Soviet Union. In the short term, a tough policy toward the Soviet Union has been quite effective. In the long term, I really don't understand how it can help peace."</p>
<h3>U.S. House Labor Committee:</h3>
<p>Passes New Bill</p>
<p>Weakening Union Power and Outlawing Strikes</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The House Labor Committee today passed a major new bill, weakening union power and outlawing strikes. The bill stipulates that workers may not negotiate wages and other issues with the factory on a trade-by-trade basis. Workers in the same factory do not have to belong to the union, unless labor and management agree otherwise. However, the committee is willing to wait until next week to present it for discussion in the House.</p>
<h3>British Monarch to Return to Capital on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] It was announced here this morning that King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, along with their two princesses, will return from South Africa to Portsmouth Harbor on the 11th of next month, still aboard Britain's newest battleship, the "Vanguard." The British royal party is expected to disembark at the port on the 12th of next month, and then take a special train to London.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Instructs to Eliminate Ideologies from Japanese Schools</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] It is learned that the Far Eastern Commission has ordered Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers General MacArthur to take appropriate measures to eliminate all militaristic, narrowly nationalistic, and totalitarian ideologies from Japanese schools at all levels, and to reform the system to encourage democratic ideas among students and teachers.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Injuries Can Be Treated</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 12th] University of Chicago professors Allen and Jacobson today published an article in a medical journal stating that they have discovered a chemical, called "Lannerine," that can treat internal bleeding. This condition is one of the serious consequences of exposure to radiation from atomic bombs and other sources, and is inevitably fatal sooner or later, but unexpectedly, there is a medicine to save it.</p>
<h3>Chinese Representative Dr. Jin Wensi Speaks at International Trade Conference: Stabilizing the Economy Requires First Reducing Tariffs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 11th] China's Chief Representative, Ambassador to Belgium Dr. Jin Wensi, addressed the International Trade Conference in this city, strongly arguing that tariffs must be reduced before the general economic situation can be stabilized. He said that the opinions of the Chinese delegation can be summarized as follows: (1) Countries with export markets abroad and domestic production institutions that are producing at full capacity should bear greater responsibility for the success of tariff negotiations than less economically developed countries; (2) The principle of balance should be followed when it comes to the concessions proposed and obtained by a country during negotiations. However, when measuring the sacrifices made by any country, the degree of economic development of that country, the post-war reconstruction problems that must be solved, and whether or not it already has low tariffs should be taken as the criteria.</p>
<h3>Cripps Emphasizes Employment</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 11th] British Secretary of Commerce Cripps addressed the International Trade Conference today, requesting that the United States maintain and satisfy the production requirements of other countries in the world. He said that the prosperity of Britain and other countries depends on expanding world trade based on the principle of international division of labor. In the charter of the International Trade Organization, member states should strive for the goal of high employment to maintain high and stable levels of demand for goods in various countries and to maintain the real income of the people of various countries. Prior to this, Cripps stated at a press conference that the U.S. reduction of tariffs was not enough to easily replace the British government's abandonment of the imperial trade preference system, because the reduction of tariffs would inevitably be limited, and the removal of the preference system should also be subject to limitations.</p>
