<h3>國府任命五院院長　各黨府委名單同時發表政院改組短期內可完成</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日上午二時半電〕國民政府十八日令：（一）選任張　為國民政府行政院院長，此令。（二）選任孫科為國民政府立法院院長，此令。（三）選任居正為國民政府司法院院長，此令。（四）選任戴傳賢為國民政府考試院院長，此令。（五）選任于右任為國民政府　察院院長，此令。（六）選任張繼·鄒魯·宋子文·翁文灝·王寵惠·章嘉·邵力子·王世杰·蔣夢麟·鈕永建·吳忠信·陳布雷·曾琦·陳啓天·余家菜·何魯之·伍憲子·胡海門·戢翼翹·莫德惠·陳輝德·王雲五·鮑爾漢為國民政府委員，此令。</p>
<p>〔央社南京十八日上午二時半電〕國民政府頃除於十八日國民政府　都南京紀念日發表五院院長及國民政府委員各選任令外，聞又分發聘函，加聘宋慶齡，胡毅生，劉哲，魏懷，陳其采，許崇智，陳樹人，陳策，張鈁，堯樂博士，迪魯瓦，蕭萱，李根源等十三人為國民政府顧問。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕五院院長人選，除政院由張羣出任外，餘無變動，至五院之副院長人選，現尙未提出，政院之改組，衆信短期內即將完成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕醞釀逾一載之國民政府擴大基礎，國民黨實現結束訓政，延攬各黨派人士參加政府，準備實施憲政之國府改組終底於成，中華民國將自十八日起以新姿態向世界民主之潮流中邁進。</p>
<p>國民政府成立以來，實施訓政，無時不欲還政於民，而達　政之境，乃內憂外侮幾無寗日，八年抗戰終獲勝利，國府乃有政協之召開，與各黨派協商，尤對持有武力之共黨，誠懇商討解決國是，惟共黨執迷不悟，政協決議迄未遵行，甚至衊视國府，否認政協同意召開之國民大會及所制定之憲法，關閉和談之門，致國府改組無法延攬中共參加，然政府初衷未變，國府改組之義，終以民社·青年兩黨及社會賢達之誠意參加，而告實現。</p>
<p>新國府於國府成立廿週年紀念之日組成，宣示國人及世界，我中華民國已開始向實政途徑邁進，國民黨正與各黨為民主政治之努力協力建國偉業，此為我國劃時代之事件，亦世界和平前進之表徴也。今後新政府將在共同負責之下，為實施黨政，推進民主而努力。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京十七日電〕中宣部長彭學沛稱：國府委員席額，仍有十一名虛位以待中共與民盟之代表。又蔣主席定十八日晨十時半舉行外國記者招待會議，此為主席在戰後第二次之招待外國記者，第一次乃勝利後不久在重慶舉行者。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕府委名單已正式公布，國府之改組將於國府成立廿週年紀念之日完成，蔣主席將於一二日內就此發表簡短談話，全部府委包括三黨曁社會賢達之名單，十七日晚已由彭部長宣布，各方對比均極表興奮。府委之宣誓就職大典何時舉行，現尙未悉，惟府委會則定廿一日召開。</p>

<h3>立院討論銀行法已完成一讀程序　銀聯會請願暫保留二讀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕銀行法草案全文十軍一百十九條，經立法院十七日上午三二二次例會討諭，已一讀通過，即可完成立法程序。按國府曾於民國廿年春公布銀行法，惟迄未施行，抗戰結束後，立院着手整理銀行法，先後七易其稿，迨本月中旬全部審查竣事，而於大會提出。</p>
<p>該法第一章為定義，規定銀行業務為：（一）收受各種存款，（二）票貼現，（四）國內匯兌，（五）特許經營之國外匯兌，（六）代理收付款項，（七）倉庫及保管業務，（八）買賣有價證劵及投資，（九）代募或承募公債，公司債及公司股份，（十）特許買賣生金銀及外幣，（十）（一）受託經管財產。第二章通則，規定本法所稱銀行共分五類：（一）商業銀行，（二）實業銀行，（三）儲蓄銀行，（四）信託公司，（五）錢莊。並規定各銀行不得經營其所登記核准業務種類以外之業務，違者得科銀行各負責人一萬元以下罰鍰或勒令撤換其負責人，其情節重大者，並得撤銷其營業執照。第三章規定商業銀行繳存保證準備金之比率，業務範圍及放款額。第四章規定實業銀行應繳保證準備金比率，業務範圍及放款額，第五章規定儲蓄銀行應繳準備金比率，業務範圍與儲戶存款，每戶最高限額及放款總額，第六章規定信託公司業務範圍與投資限制。第七章規定錢莊業務範圍，放款限制。</p>
<h3>外國銀行設分行所在地應受限制</h3>
<p>第八章規定外國銀行在我國設立分行，所在地區應受限制，並規定不得經營為兼營儲蓄銀行或信託公司業務，收付款項亦以法幣為限，且規定存款應在我國境內運用。第九章規定銀行之登記及特許，最後的第十章為附則。</p>
<p>該案於會中提出後首由原起草人張肇元報告修正動機立法原則及所遇困難，說明本草案於輔導獎勵之中，仍不免有限制約束之嫌。詞畢，即開始作原則上之研討，陳顧遠指出草案在實質上，按術上，皆多可以商酌之處。目，殊感棘手，能否立即付諸實行，大成問題。孫九綠亦認目前經濟將在非常時期狀態，幣值亦未穩定，管制過鬆，足以影響金融；而銀行方面，又盼勿過於約束。財部前會表示，該辦法即使通過，公布上期亦盼能由部令定之。事實如此，不容忽視。當由張肇元分別解釋，指出資本額全國無法一致，草案定將全國分成若干區，分別核定，如是可不致因幣值不定而有影響。</p>
<h3>錢莊應否算銀行　討論時爭執最烈</h3>
<p>繼即逐條討論，爭執最烈者，為錢莊應否列為銀行；最初決定小將錢莊列入，其後又予恢復。劉先僑認為關於錢莊之規定，可以特別法規規定之，不必列入銀行法。孫九錄指出錢莊經營者為商業銀行業務，可包括於商業銀行章中，張肇元不以為然，說明銀行無法深入農材，而錢莊在各地又有其重大之作用，將來至相當程度後，又將改為銀行，同時其性質亦一定與商業銀行盡同，似以維持原案為宜，決議錢莊仍列為本法听稱銀行之中，並專章規定其業務範　。</p>
<p>另一引起長時期討論者，為銀行若經營其所登記核准業務種類以外之業務時，應如何予以懲罰，程元斟發言認為罰各負責人千元罰　為數過　，情節重大者僅予撤換亦覺過輕，撤銷營業執照亦不足以使擾亂金融者寒心，主張應從嚴懲處，王毓祥等亦認為千元之數對擾亂市塲者無異九牛一毛。張肇元等說明千元罰緩係民法規定如此，撤換負責人事關顏面，不能僅謂為薄懲。至撤銷執照，其對銀行界之打擊，重於一切，決議將千元改為萬元，並將條文改為撤換其負責人，其情節重大者並得撤銷其營業執照。</p>
<p>簡貫三指出存款人利益應予保障，主張加列一條，即「銀行為保障存款人之利益，應聯合成立存款保障之組織」以多數通過。</p>
<p>討論將畢，銀聯會代表王延松，徐國慰，徐維明，傅汝霖，來院請願，昐能暫緩決定，由吳秘書長尚應接見，並向院報告接談經過，草案一百十九條，全部討論完畢，一讀通過，二讀程序暫予保留。會議至下午一時許始散</p>

<h3>蔣主席政權鞏固　中國始有自由　范登堡請國會支持杜魯門</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日電〕范登堡於參院公開電稱：渠不同意政府對中國及阿根廷二國之政策，關於中國，渠相信只有在蔣主席鞏固其政權時，始有和平可言。這進而警吿國會稱：如國會不支持杜魯門計劃，則今後美國將無和平反對共黨之機會，此無異昭吿世人，侵略者可以橫行無忌矣。</p>

<h3>華府商討日賠償問題　美將提總解決方案　我作戰最久應獲大部物資</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日電〕東京盟軍總部人員頃返議，與總軍部及國務院，商討賠償問題。據悉：一般　為中國對日作戰最久，僉信其能善盡利用重工業配備，以及運輸方面之便利，故實為宜獲大部份遷移物資之國家。盟總代表返美商談後，猶未能改變此問官關於需要進行最後解決建議之意見，此因彼等鑒及遠東委員會其他委員，必將提出要求，然最近討論，已發生確切影響。使此問若干官員，改變關於可自日本獲得若何賠償物資，以及其價値若干之意見。盟總代表將於明日結束討論。據若干人士稱，盟總代表此次返美討論。巳予此問官員對於日本賠償問題，獲一明晰之印象。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕據今日獲悉；現在華府之盟軍總部賠款代表團若干代表，曾吿陸軍部與國務院稱：渠等相信戰勝各盟國，在最後分析後。自日太所能搬移之國內資產，作為賠款用者，將不致多過美國所預期之百分之三十之臨時計劃。</p>
<p>按美國百分之三十之臨時計劃，賦權麥克阿新處理，提出日本國內可供賠款用之百分之十五，分配與英國，荷蘭及菲列濱。除此而外，美國業已準備一最後計劃，即將送交遠東委員會，根據此一計劃，中國再分配得百分之三十，而將其餘百分之十，分配與遠東委員會其他會員國</p>

<h3>日本紡織業計劃　盟軍總部專家草擬完成　明年出口數量佔戰前百分之廿七</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京十七日電〕據本社遠東經理房恩所獨得之消息，盟軍總部紡織事家業已完成日本紡織業之計劃，估計日本一九四七年之棉織品出品，其數量約為每年二八五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅，即佔戰前最高率九四五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅之百分之二十七。盟軍總部紡織業之計劃，乃在日本工廠搬移後，使日本紡織業，有充分之錠數，其要點如下：（一）有充分之產品，達一九三〇—三四年之水準，足供日本人之需要；（二）在最近期內以相當數量供出口之用。</p>
<p>盟軍發言人，對中國黃元彬之談話，頓不同意。據黃氏稱：日本紡織業，如經獎勵達相當程度，則可能如戰前一般，作為再度控制中國及亞洲其他部分之先導。據華人方面宣稱：日本紗廠，現已復工者，約有三百萬錠，另有三百萬錠，亦將在麥帥支持下開始增添，其範圍遠較現所擬定之復興計劃為大。惟據最近調查，在本年二月廿八日，日本開工之錠數，約為一百另四萬另一千錠，為適應日本國內需要，及供應世界棉織品之缺乏，增加錠數，實屬必要。但盟軍總部，對一切日本工業之擴張，皆加嚴密管制，故對其他紡織業區之利益，並無立即有大規模侵奪之危險。</p>
<p>盟軍當局對南京方面高壓力競爭，足使中國紡織業摧毀之談話，表示驚異。渠等指出：中國之一·四〇〇·〇〇〇紡錠，祗能供該國四億五千萬人中極小一部分人之用。由於中國紡織業之擴充，達到足供中國國內需要時，尙需多年，故此自為合理之事，即假定中國需要接受任何國外之供給而不必過問其來自何國是也。就此點言之，中國方面可能提高關稅對付日本紡織品之建議，實對中國人不利之措施。盟軍總部之官員表示，渠等關於重建中國之紡織業計劃，極願與中國政府合作，並願對該工業發展之技術問題，以日本紡織機器合理之數量出口，予中國以協助。據渠等稱：中國應擴充其紡織業達工十倍之大，以便供應遠東紡織市塲之需要。中國方面之建議，將日本紡織業减削其錠數，達一最小限度，遭盟軍總部之紡織官員反唇相議，謂日本現有之紡錠，已達盟軍總部所認為維持日本國內和平經濟所必需之最小限度之下云。</p>

<h3>工實施行施政方針！</h3>
<p>——慶祝國府奠都南京廿週紀念——</p>
<p>今天是國民政府奠都南京二十週紀念日，在二十年前的今天，國民黨領導國民革命軍北伐，打倒了割據稱雄的軍閥，而奠都南京，替全國統一開創一個新局面，同時國民黨實行訓政，也在這一天開始。但在二十年以後的今天，國民政府自動改組，羅致民靑兩黨領袖曁社會賢達加人政府，同時各黨派與社會賢達所商定之施政方釗，也在今天，明令公佈，不僅可視為國民黨對於還政於民的實踐，而且也是中國政治史上的一個重要轉捩點。所以我們在今天，行見國內政局日趨明朗，對於今後的中國政治，油然而生一幕美麗的遠景。不過我們回顧與前瞻，不難證明中國政治的步入和平民主的坦途，尙需要各黨各派曁全國人民的加倍努力，始能使一幕美麗的遠景成為眼前的現實。</p>
<p>這次政府改組，並非僅僅以人事的更迭為限，而其眞正的意義，乃在擴大政府的民主基礎。所以我們認為這次政府改組，實為國民黨對於還政於民的實踐。我們平心而論，國民黨訓政二十年，因為內憂外患的交迫，雖未能達成訓政的最終目的；但是對於人民政治意識的抬高，以及民主思想的散佈確有不可磨滅的功績；這是誰也不能否認的。而今國民黨仍一太其天下為公的精神，改組政府，延攬各黨派領袖曁社會賢達，參加政府，共同負起準備實施憲政的任務。在我國民主政治的發展史上，實在是一個重要的轉捩點。</p>
<p>改組政府的發動，遠在去年一月政治協商會開幕之前，因為當時在抗戰勝利之後，舉國一致的認為，從抗戰勝利到建國開始的過渡時期，應由國民黨結束訓政，而由各黨各派與社會賢達，共同負起辦理軍事善後及籌備憲政的巨艱。所以改組政府的方案，也是政協五大決議之一。其後國共爭執紛起，衝突未已，一直沒有實現，到了去年十二月國民大會閉幕之後，改　組政府的聲浪方始大起，中共與民盟，雖拒不參加，但延　其他政黨份子曁社會賢達加入政府自然也可以擴大政府的民主基礎，從而打開目前政治的僵局，走上和平民主的坦途。經過四五個月的努力，改組政府終於在今天實現了；性念的人或者要嫌其速度太慢，但其按步就班的進行，早已有重大的成就。第一是民靑兩黨曁社會賢達的參加政府四機構（立法院·監察院·國民參政會曁憲政實施促進會）第二是立法院的通過有關憲政實施的十種法規，實已完成實施憲法的程序。故至今改組政府，誠可謂瓜熟蒂落了。</p>
<p>改組後的國民政府，以其性質而論，是一種從國民黨結束訓政走到憲政時期的臨時政府；以其所負的任務而言，乃在如期完成實施憲政所必需的一切進備工作。新憲法定於本年十二月廿五日起開始實施，距今祇有八個月，依照其規定實施准備程序而言，可分為兩類：（一）自憲法公佈之日起，現行法令之與憲法相抵觸者，國民政府應迅速分別予以修改或廢止；（二）憲法公佈後，國民政府應依照憲法之規定，於三個月內，制定並公佈下列各項法律：（一）關於國民火會之組織，國民大會代表之選舉，罷免；二關於總統副總統之選舉，罷免；（三）關於立法委員之選舉，罷免；（四）關於五院之組織。我們把目前的工作情形佔計一下，可知第二類的準備工作，業已完成了。關於第二類的工作，尙待改組後的政府積極進行。惟準備實施　政最重要的工作，不在立法方面的準備程序，而在人民對於民主政治的認識，所以在此過渡時期，尤應注意政治的民主作風，使人民耳黨目染，均能養成民主的氣氛。本年秋季所舉行的第一次普選，實為中國政治能否民主化的一大考騐。</p>
<p>在此過渡時期，政府除了集中全力準備實施憲政而外，對於內政，外交，財政，經濟，文化，敎育、尙不能因準備　政而任其廢弛；所以今後政府應採取何種施政方針，在改組政府之前，不能不由各黨派協商而加以快定，作為政府在過渡時期施政所當遵守的最高指導原則。國民黨代表與民靑兩黨領袖，協商此事，不知化了多少時間與心血，從開始商談改組政府起，一直到上月下旬，始在原則上成立協議，共計十二條，對於如何解決當前的幾個重要問題，在原則上均已有所規定，不僅可為各黨派共同遵守的綱領，而且可以藉此打開目前政治上的僵局。本報於上月廿五日業已加以評論，即料到國內政局即將開朗；並指出這十二要點，是全國人民一致要求的共同施政綱領。現在我們更加相信，改紙後政府的施政方針之公佈，足以澄淸目前國內的政局，使全國人民對於今後政局的發展，都會抱着樂觀的態度。</p>
<p>但是我們在以愉快的心情慶祝國府奠都南京廿週紀念日並以同樣的心情歡迎國民政府的改組之後，我們還有若干意見貢獻給參加政府的各黨派領袖。</p>
<p>第一，這十二條施政方針，旣是各黨派領袖一再協商而產生的，且是經各黨派領袖鄭重簽字的，雖不能視為共同所有的神聖憲章，但改組後的政府必須切實履行。我們敢大胆地說；這十二個方針，正是全國人民所一致期待於政府者；政府實施此項方針，不論遭遇何種困難與障礙，必能獲得全國人民的擁護而克服。否則今日人民的快慰，勢必又要落空了。而且我們還要指出，規定施政方針的文字，明自易曉，為國人所共見，任何人不能加以曲解。尤其是代表一黨一派簽字的領袖，不能任意解釋。</p>
<p>第二，改組後的政府，其基礎業已擴大，己不是國民黨的一黨政府，而是國民黨與其他黨派共同組織的政府了。這種政府的基礎，完全建築在業派的精誠團結與通力合作之上。否則就難望穩定；所以我們希望參加政府的各黨派領袖，均能運用其政治智慧；對於任何問題，均能自遠處看，從大處着想；將國家利益置於黨派之上，不再為斤斤較量的黨人，而能為光明磊落的政治家。</p>
<p>要之，中國政治的出路，厥在和平，民主，統一建國；這次改組政府，雖已開始走向這條坦途；但是能否達到我們的目的？尙須視改組後的政府能否開明，大公無私，集中人才，切實實施這十二條施政方針而定了！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十七日廣播：美國某高級代表頃宣稱，除非蘇聯方面突然讓步，各外長認為對德問題之討論，已告結束。各外長此項決定，係因馬歇爾與史達林會談無結果之故。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十六日電〕關於史達林元帥與馬歇爾國務卿會談業已失敗一項傳說，此間報紙雖均以顯要地位加以揭載，半官方人士亦深以為然，但白宮及國務院對此說均未發表正式聲明。據外交界人士稱：蘇聯外長莫洛托夫同意在四國外長本屆會議時簽訂對奧和約，乃為蘇聯不能拒絕之讓步。在目前情形之下，史達林元帥及馬歇爾國務卿均堅持其自身之立塲，殆無疑義。外交界人士將現行局勢綜合成三點如下：（一）蘇聯對於奧國問題表示同意，乃為顧全美國體面；（二）德國之命運現仍操諸蘇聯手中；（三）莫洛托夫對於四強公約草案所提出之修正案，其目的乃在使此項公約成為不可能。蘇聯對於對德和約中之任何條款，凡足使美國維持其在歐洲之利益者，均不願簽字。半官方人士認為馬帥與史達林會談已在美蘇關係中引起新因素，並非絕對不可能，但其後果，則須待日後分曉。</p>
<h3>特港總督　蘇聯已提出入選</h3>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖十七日電〕蘇聯本日推選瑞典國會中之自由份子百萊丁為特里雅斯德自由港之總督。預料英美兩國將反對此項任命，蓋英美皆有其夾袋中人物也。惟蘇聯此一行動，眾料至少能使五強開始對此問題作商討之步驟。按特港總督須由安全理事會任命，但五強希望在人選方面，先行私自獲得同意，然後再將其任命提呈安理會。</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕美國會所派往近東之巡察團，頃返抵此間，提出報告稱：希臘與土耳其兩國皆擔心蘇聯之侵略，但深盼美國能支持彼等。參議員海爾樞，白萊斯脫及福開森皆稱：依據彼等短期考察，認為批准援助希土兩國四億元借款之計劃，實屬必要。</p>

<h3>德國希島要塞　將予澈底炸毀</h3>
<p>（聯合社德國希立哥闌十七日電）德國在北海中希立哥闌島上之軍事設備，希特勒偉大計劃之一，當以此自豪，十八日下午九時（上海時間）將予以澈底炸毀，此為比基尼島原子彈試騐以來最大之人造爆炸，亦為聯合國消滅德國戰爭機構最奇偉之舉動。此小島長僅一哩，寬約半哩，為德皇威廉對準英國心臟之一把利劍。第二次世界大戰中，被用作重要根據地，可容納一人駕駛之潛水艇，並有十五吋口徑大砲一排，及雷達設備，以偵察空襲德國之聯合國飛機。此外尚有龐大之隧道網，內儲巨額軍火及秘密實騐工塲，安藏地下。島上居民現在祇有英人十名，德人一百六十名，準備將其炸毀，使之不能再供軍用。</p>
<p>該島昔日不獨為海軍基地，且為遊歷勝景，原有居民二千五百人，生活頗為優裕，今則島中房屋悉已破壞，公用事業無一留存，此後除漁民臨時搭屋暫住外，殆將無人安居其上矣。</p>
<p>該島係於一八九。年由英人割讓與德，以交換東菲之長齊巴羣島。因其地處衝要，故在兩次世界大戰中均足威脅英國。島上軍備在第二次世界大戰時計有三〇·五厘米海軍砲三尊，一〇·五厘米高射砲三尊，大榴彈砲兩尊，及雷達站一處。島之中央尚有英國四引擎轟炸機一架之遺骸，英美飛行員即葬身於其地教堂中。</p>
<p>一九四五年四月五日經英國大舉空襲之後，居民撤至大陸，其私產約四萬噸，亦於戰事結束後運赴大陸，其他可以移動之有用物件，已悉被漁民取去，島上現仍懸掛英旗。隧道密如蜂巢，入口處在峭壁之下，蜿蜒曲折而進，內中埋藏之軍火，劇專家估計，殆不下六千五百噸，其中三千四百噸為炸藥，今將一並與以銷毀。引綫長達數哩，與水底電纜相接　，通至九哩外之浮標。</p>
<p>據專家意見，爆炸之力將深入地下一百理，科學家希望可藉此探知歐洲地殼構造之若干秘密。倫敦，莫斯科及羅馬等處地震測騐所已接獲通知，請於明日爆炸時注意地球之震動。據英國某海軍軍官稱，爆炸目的並非欲完全毀滅該島，惟隧道陷入後，島之高度將減低，石壁亦將崩坍，主要之隧道被毀時，島之一端或將分裂。爆炸後大約將等候二日，俟煙氣消散，再行入港察勘。</p>
<h3>汽油池七十五處焚燒　德克撒斯城大火　全城已成火海死八百人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：美國紅十字會估計，死於德克撒斯城爆炸慘劇者達八百人之多。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕德克撒斯城今日因一載運硝酸氬之船舶起火，引起化學工廠及油池之爆炸，如原子彈炸後之菌狀煙霧直昇天空，全城毒氣揚溢，死者在五百人與一千人之間，傷者在二千人與八千人之間，為美國有史以來之空前慘劇。全城油池焚燒，使救護隊無法入內，房屋悉被困於火海之中。爆炸後數小時，街頭尚為昏迷之居民數千所擁塞，城內房屋及高大建築物，頗多夷為平地，今以該城對外電話全斷，故確切情報尚付缺如。綜合各方面報告，探得出事情形如下：</p>
<p>貨船起火　繼以爆炸</p>
<p>今晨有七一七六噸之自由式船「大營」號，載運硝酸氬肥料至德克撒斯城，旣抵碼頭，船上不知何故，忽然起火，撲救無效，乃拖入何中，企圖繼續灌救，不料即發生爆炸，波及河岸之孟山多化學廠，該廠亦繼之爆炸，銅鐵棟樑被彈至十五哩以外，該廠全部被毀。二十公里外之卡爾佛斯東城，玻璃櫥窗及天花板等被震碎不少，當時居民猶以為發生地震，均奔出街中逃避。紐約與德克撒斯城及附近城市之電話交通，至晚六時猶未通。另據海岸衛隊之報告稱：碼頭沿岸之建築物，已悉被炸坍，德克撒斯城中心最堅固之石頭建築物，竟亦夷為平地。</p>
<p>隔岸觀火　慘遇活埋</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社德克撒斯城十七日電〕本城昨日整日爆炸後，居民一萬五千人已奉令疏散，以防毒氣之危險。七十五處汽油池一齊起火，外加其他之火災，使全城厚厚包裹在濃煙中。昨夜全城宣布戒嚴，軍隊巡邏廢城，以防搶刦。「大營」號首次爆炸在午前九時二十分，繼之發生連串爆炸，當時消防員奮勇救火，岸上觀火者甚眾，突然一聲爆炸，乃將觀火者盡行活埋，屍體一團團堆積，有多達七十五具者，大營號貨船已炸成粉碎。</p>
<p>火勢逼近　炸藥倉庫</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕據卡爾佛斯登最近來報告稱：德克撒斯城火勢已逼近碼頭一存儲炸藥之倉庫，故警方已令一切救護人員停止救護工作，立即撤退。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德克撒斯城十七日電〕此間今日又發生爆炸兩起。火燄蔓延，漸次迫近軍火庫，毒氣廠，及另一滿載硝酸甘油貨船。居民正在紛紛逃避。</p>
<p>〔合眾社德克薩斯州德克斯城十七日電〕繼昨日法貨船「大營」號之驚人爆炸後，今日淸晨二時另一運裝硝酸　之貨船「高飛」號在港內爆炸。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕陸軍部今日午後接到恐嚇電話，謂某團體將於午後四時炸毀陸軍部大廈，倫敦警察總局得訊，即派幹探前往澈底搜索，並無可疑之處。先是，今晨杜佛大廈殖民部辦事處之女廁所中發現杜製定時炸彈一枚，殖民部發言人稱，此乃猶太恐怖份子所為。按去年巴勒斯坦局勢緊張時，亦有多數大廈接到恐嚇電話。</p>
<h3>美社會工作會議揭幕　討論援華新方法　主張採取更明晰救濟政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十六日電〕美國社會工作會議今日在此間揭幕，會員多人籲請美國給予中國以新型援助，建議提高華僑移民限額並採取更明晰之救濟政策。芝加哥移民保障同盟理事里區夫人要求訂立新法律，使外僑更易歸化美國。據稱：最足協助華人歸化之惟一途徑為提高其移民限額。一九二四年美國若能公平相待，而不歧視，二十三年來中國移民二千四百十五人身份或已確定，早成美國公民。美國應矯正過去錯誤，至少給予華人以該一機會，勿再稽延。前聯總駐華分署副署長霍佛則對中國救濟問題，表示悲觀。據稱，美國企圖援華必須改變其社會援助機構與外交政策。中國經濟水準應予全部改變，並修正稅收機構，裁減軍費。中國即就自身標準而論，亦屬貧困國家，故應聽　設法自救，以決定需要何種外援。吾人援助中國，誼所當然，但須出以謙遜態度，且與之分甘共苦，非僅施捨而已。</p>

<h3>聯合國特別會議　本月廿八日召開</h3>
<p>猶阿代表勢將發生衝突</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國機構秘書長賴依本日向報界宣稱：聯合國大會舉行特別會議討論巴勒斯坦問題時，余不擬正式邀請杜魯門總統主持開幕儀式，大會將由比利時代表朗琪霍夫主持開幕，不致舉行正式開幕儀式。截至目前為止，各國之函覆聯合國機構同意召開此項特別會議者，已有卅五國，其中最後四國為土耳其·波蘭·　利維亞及烏拉圭，尚無任何國家要求將其他問題列入大會議程。但大會可能選舉託管理事會之二理事國。聯合國機構永久會址為第一批新　，或可於一九四九年建築完成云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國特別大會定於本月廿八日召開，討論巴勒斯坦問題，猶太人與阿拉伯人雙方均在策劃戰略，預料屆時將發生重大衝突。猶太公會發言人稱：該會將正式要求准許猶太代表參加討論，並立即開放巴勒斯坦，容納猶太移民。阿拉伯方面發言人稱：該兩提案均將遭遇堅決反對。聯合國機構秘書長雷義則稱：大會本身必須決定討論範圍，所望各代表勿拘泥形式，使討論得以迅速進行。</p>

<h3>英國積極準備　參加對日和會</h3>
<p>正與自治領交換意見中</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕關於麥帥提議美政府早日召開對日和會事，英國與各自治領刻正就此事交換意見。據悉：英國對於澳洲及紐西闌要求為對日和會之主要參與國家，亦提供保證為其後盾。據此間政界人士談稱：美國國務院殆將接受麥帥之建議，馬歇爾國務卿自莫斯科返抵華府後之第一項工作，則為考慮早日召開對日和會。觀於美政府前令麥帥將日戰爭工業撥出百分之卅，分配與中·英·荷·菲等國，作為賠款，但並未提及澳洲與紐西闌之要求，故英國與其自治領交換意見，自屬刻不容緩。</p>

<h3>賠償物資中無一噸商船　航業界表示詫異　民營船隻償會促當局注意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據民營船隻賠償委員會負責人鍾山道發表談話稱：在日本賠償物資中，竟無一噸商船，我國航業界甚爲詫異，除擬即向政府提議向遠東賠償委員會促請注意外，我國航業界對麥帥此種政策，表示堅決反對。蓋日木爲海洋起家之國家，其海洋勢力，不論以後遠東國際時局如何，必須加以限制，更以中國未來國運繫於海洋力量建設者甚大，勢須堅決力爭。現日本戰餘船隻在一百五十萬噸以上，在麥帥保護政策所保留之日本造船重工業之規模甚大，其造船能力，不川十年，仍可一躍爲世界上一等海洋强國。故我國朝野上下，必須全力注視麥帥此項政策所引起之後果。</p>

<h3>我國根據波茨坦協定應為對德和會邀請國　汪竹一發表意見</h3>
<p>自莫斯科四國外長會議中，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫及對中國爲對德和會邀請國後，我國王外長已於日前發表嚴正聲明，記者以此一問題極受各方注目，特走訪國民外交協會滬分會秘書長在竹一，承發表意見如後：中國應爲和會邀請國，無論從任何一方面說，比蘇聯毫無遜色，中國是首先反對侵略和對德宣戰的國家，因爲全力對日戰爭，所以未能遠赴重洋，參加對德軍事，因爲未參加對德軍事，所以未參加簽訂德國投降書。但從整個戰局來看，中國在遠東戰塲上，始終牽制日本，使日本無力助德，進攻蘇聯，加速德國崩潰，使整國戰爭提前結束。我國今天只在要求嚴格執行波茨坦協定，並無任何越出此項協定之要求，波茨坦協定是處置侵略者與重建和平的基本協議，任何一國均不容加以破壞。我們珍視蘇聯的友誼，期待蘇聯改變態度，根據中蘇條約精神，共同致力於國際合作，以奠定未來世界之永久和平。</p>
<h3>亞洲文會·學術演講　蔣廷黻縱論中國生命綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前行總署長蔣廷黻氏，昨應本市尙賢堂（International　Institute　of　China）之邀，於下午五時半在博物院路二十號亞洲文會演講「中國的生命綫」。尙賢堂係本市國際人士學術性之組織，已有四十餘年歷史，現與亞洲文會合作，經常舉行名人演講。茲誌昨日蔣氏演詞大意如下：「第二次世界大戰結束以後，國際關係的發展頗爲令人失望，大家都希望能够改善。本來國際政治可以分成兩種；一是强權政治，一是理想政治。無可諱言者今日國際間强權政治之存在，實爲一重要事實。强權政治所爭者係戰略地帶及戰略上所需要之物資。但人固不能無麵包而生存，亦不能單靠麵包而生存。人類有理想，有主義，爲理想爲主義而戰，較之戰略上的鬥爭實更爲重要。</p>
<p>中國的生命綫不在於港口，島嶼，海岸綫，或物資之爭。中國的生命綫，在於能不受外力干涉，根據中國人民之意志及情况，自由發展一種社會經濟制度。</p>
<p>目前世界形勢，爲美蘇兩大勢力之對壘。兩方都相信自己制度之完美，且都抱「有我即無你」之偏見。但是以個人看來，社會經濟制度實大有變通。中國所應發展之制度旣非美國式的，亦非蘇聯式的。中國不能採取美國式的私人資本制度，其原因基於中國人民的傳統觀念，對於私人資本制度不感興趣。若干事業，如鐵路·軍火·煉油等等，目前必須由政府經營，而將來現代技術發展之結果，如水利電力等等，亦以政府經營爲有利。中國歷史傳統並不反對政府多多做事，至於效率的問題，可逐漸改善。在另一方面，中國亦不能如蘇聯式的國家經濟完全由政府控制。因中國人民個人主義色彩較濃，傳統的土地私有制度已有數千年歷史，如蘇聯的集體農塲，在中國不可能實行。且集體制度優點在於大規模使用機器，在中國則不然·因中國農作物以米爲主，而米之種植比較難於機械化。</p>
<p>因此，中國的社會經濟制度，爲政府企業</p>
<p>與私人企業並肩存在，其分量或時有輕重，但相信不致於蹈美蘇之形式。今日世界各國社會經濟制度如能在美蘇以外有更多之變化，則此一世界或能更爲健全。</p>

<h3>重建恒豐橋需費二十億</h3>
<p>工務局昨招待記者參觀</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕工務局於昨日下午二時，招待本市新聞記者，參觀恒豐橋重建工程。按該橋原址，前曾建有木質橋樑，俗稱舢板廠新橋，南接中正北二路，北連恒豐路，京滬鐵路北站及閘北一帶與滬西交通皆取道該橋，極稱便捷。淪陷期中，經敵僞拆卸，致南北交通幹綫，遂爲中斷，一切運輸車輛，不能不改由蘇州河下游各橋，而於北站滬西間之交通，須繞道中區而行，中區交通亦因而擁塞，情形歲重，亟待解決，工務局有鑒於此，爰有重建恒豐路橋之議。去年一月，復經市參議會通過積極籌劃，於本年二月間開工。</p>
<h3>採用鋼筋凝垚</h3>
<p>工務局於卅五年六月間，已作設計上之籌劃，圖表及預算，於同年十月間完竣。其設計原則，以滬市地質鬆軟，蘇州河下游各橋橋座多見沉陷，補救困難，而聯梁及懸梁諸式建築，雖用料較爲節省，跨度亦增大，但於橋座發現沉陷之後，挽救亦復不易。權衡再三，始決定用鋼筋混凝土五孔單梁橋座及橋座下部用活動鋼墊板，橋座或橋台如有沉陷，鋼墊板可隨時伸縮移動，使橋梁本身不發生任何影響。</p>
<h3>已支六億餘元</h3>
<p>該描工程設計完成後，委託中國橋樑公司代辦，該橋已於本年二月廿日開工，計目前共支用公款六億餘萬元，其中用於材料購置者爲四億七千餘萬元，合百分之七十七，工資部份，合百分之二十三，主要部份之水泥，巳向善後救濟總署請求配售，木料大部係向中央信託公司訂購，其他材料亦經比價採購。</p>
<p>該橋之預算，按卅五年十月間計算，合國幣八億餘萬元，然近來物料飛漲，按現時估計，本工程共需款二十億餘元，現正編製，請市府追加預算呈核中。</p>
<h3>文化浩刦古物外流　古董商到處蒐羅偷運出國換外滙</h3>
<p>據可靠方面消息，若干古董鉅商，現正在北平上海等地搜集我數千年來之歷史文物，運往美國出售，以換取美金外匯。聞二三日前又有極名貴之字畫·石刻·古銅·陶器·古瓷·陶俑等一百餘箱，自滬偷運出口。按古物出口，海關早懸爲禁例，故彼等於啓運前，極爲秘密，並利用種種關係，偸運出口。並悉，淸室舊藏之古物，前曾以賞溥傑（溥儀之弟）名義，陸續運出精品甚多。其中尤以古畫爲最名貴。勝利時，在長春偽宮散失殆盡，近在平滬一帶已有發現。古宮博物院聞訊後，曾出鉅資收回數件，然流落在外者尙多。且聞多已入古董商之手，亦將運美出賣。現本市關心文物之士，已聯絡古物保管委員會及海關設法加以阻止，以免我國重要文物流落於外邦。據文物考古專家某氏吿記者，我國在歷史上極重要之名貴文物，流落於國外者，極爲衆多，如最好之占銅，在美國，最好之漢磚在加拿大，名畫除流入日本者外，大批在美國。而倫敦·巴黎·瑞典等各地，亦莫不搜藏有我國極名貴之古物甚多。當抗戰時期，因交通不便，文物外流，反較目前爲少，及勝利後，海外交通暢達，難知圖利之古董商，乃將古物秘密大量運出，此實爲我國一極大損失，希望政府急速注意及此，嚴加取締，俾得保存我國現僅存之一部份國粹云云。</p>

<p>盜賣墓石</p>
<p>李鳴鳳問　先君墓地有石料砌成之墓道，於三十三年五月間發覺被人盜賣，惟當時地方情形複雜，無法制止，後經調查係兄長所爲，因於三十三年四月登報聲明產權，同時雇工將原物找回，受買人亦未千涉，但翌年正月受買人又將該項石料私行抬去，近委律師具狀法院自訴控受買人損毁墳墓，（刑法三五三條）惟法院認爲係余兄長出賣，須俟民訴部份解決後方可受理，現奉庭諭暫行撤回，請問　（一）墳墓建築石料是否可以買賣？（二）共同產權可否單獨處分？（三）本人事先登報聲明產權，法律上是否具效力？（四）該項賣契非先兄親筆，中人亦未簽字，似係受買人所書，是否有效？（五）進行民訴應如何辦理，方為有效？（六）逕投檢察處　訴可否提起公訴？（七）受買人甲轉售與乙再轉售與丙而丙已築成墳墓丙是否負連帶責任？（八）敵僞時期不願控訴遷延迄今是否失去時效？（九）本人並無物證，被告物證祗不成文之賣契兩紙，是否即能拆毁人家墳墓？（十）人證可否採爲根據？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕　（一）可，（二）不可，（一）不得據以對抗「不知情善意之第三者」，（四）買賣契約，，並不以親筆書寫爲成立要件，故賣契雖非出賣人之親筆，仍屬有效，（五）應依照民法物權編共有之規定，以共有人向法院請求確認該買賣契約無效，再請求令買受人返還共有物，（六）不可，因同一案件，業經提起自訴而徹回者，依法不得再行向檢察處吿訴，（七）不負，因連帶責任，除明示自願負相者外，以法律上有規定者爲限，（八）未失時效，（九）應視所有權之誰屬而定，所有人於法令限制之範圍內，得自由處分其所有物，即能拆除其自己所有之墳墓，（十）可作爲證明方法之一種。</p>

<h3>贛中等學校敎員支薪等級已決定</h3>
<p>〔本報市昌航訊〕贛省省立中等以上學校校長教員支薪等級，及年功加俸辦法，業經省府會議通過。據悉：贛省各中等以上學校校長教員，所支薪額，事實上已超過部定標準，如國內大學畢業生最高僅得叙委任五級或四級，而事實上多自委任三級起叙。又如國內外大學畢業，有專門著作經審查合格者，叙俸由薦任十二級或十級起至簡任五級止，而專科學校教員，以與文官同等之資歷，則係自薦任五級起至簡任三級止，均遠較文官叙級爲寬。故依文官叙俸辦法，實難妥切符合。惟聞各省教職員薪額，實比贛省爲高。</p>

<h3>紗價暴漲存棉短絀　民營紗廠遭遇困難　紡管會民營紗廠委員全體辭職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會中民營紗廠委員王啓宇·榮鴻元·唐星海·郭棣活等四人，近以紗價一再暴漲，各廠存棉短絀，再生產遭遇空前困難，而王氏等旣爲六區棉紡公會之常務理事，又兼任紡管會委員之職，上須貫澈政府平抑紗價之決策，下須顧全各民營紗廠之生存問題，承上啓下，極感處境艱困。經連日商討結果，終於昨日下午，集體向紡管會呈請准予辭職。其辭呈業由六區棉紡公會副秘書長汪竹一，於昨日下午四時，送呈紡管會兼主委吳　楨。聞吳兼主委對民營紗廠目前處境之艱困，率已洞悉詳情，極表同情。對王氏等提出辭呈之事，表示挽留。並囑在氏轉約王氏等四委員，於今日下午在市府會談，洽商解決困難之辦法。</p>
<p>據六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇昨話記者：本人等忝爲紡管會委員，對我國棉紡織業之前途，無時不擬設法覓求正當出路。無如目前困難重重，終未能獲致貫澈之解決辦法。自覺長此尸位因循，殊屬匪是，不如退讓賢者，故不得而已提出辭呈。本人今日（十七日）曾建議吳兼主委，對棉紡織業擬一澈底辦法，使能兼顧國家抑平紗價之政策，及維持同業之生存，吳兼主委對此甚表同情。本人以爲在此大前提下，務使做到國民營紗廠同一步伐，原料均分，原料價格需確定，再生產之成本價，需有合理正確之計算方法。否則民營紗廠固屬無法生存，國營紗廠亦無法站足。本人認爲目前棉紡業最大之艱困，仍莫過於存棉短絀，及議價不敷成本價格兩點。按去年底調查，各廠存棉，平均約四五個月。茲者四月已過，各廠存底之枯竭，已屬急如星火。各廠自去年九月間開始售紗迄今，迄未結到一包外棉。而聯總到滬之五萬包存棉，雖已配出二萬四千包，契約已簽，惟貨仍未到手。種種實際困難，不一而足。終望能獲得一澈底解決辦法，俾各廠能維持棉紗之再生產云。</p>
<h3>棉紗棉布一致回降</h3>
<p>棉紗晨開尙無多大變化，嗣以天津禁止出口，傳佈市塲，人心不振，喊價一致回降。除四十二支藍鳳喊價梢升外，餘多下降，塲外形勢頗爲渙散。</p>
<p>棉布突吿猛退，蓋報載天津方面禁止出口，致人心虛軟，客帮採辦轉滯，一般多頭鑒於情勢不佳，頻有急吐之勢，喊價齊步回降。龍頭細布喊二十二萬元，尙乏人問津。五福二十一萬二千元，四君子金印嗶嘰二十一萬六千元，其餘色布士林等脚地亦均吿軟化。</p>
<h3>散戶有賣統債平穩</h3>
<p>公價昨市平庸，成交僅三百餘萬，統丙晨開一二八〇〇元，高價一三六〇〇元，低價一二七〇〇元，最後仍站一三一〇〇元左右。散戶有賣，四〇八室五〇三室則買，結果較前收計甲乙丁各升八百元，統戊升四百元，統丙平穩而已。</p>
<h3>過程多盤外股略升</h3>
<p>外股昨亦受華股之刺激，證券帮及各色游覽有吸，怡紗曾高至四一五〇〇元外，而後稍回，過程多盤。亞洲有收還船舶訊，求方絞股，結果較前收計業廣喊高一成，怡紗英聯紙業怡啤航業鋼業各漲半成左右，會德豐僅吿微升，橡皮股略平，蘭格志一萬八有供。</p>

<p>晨初　開出升降不一，遞永紗上塲八九號二一三號六一號一七號一九八號四號來納，一四五號亦進現永紗，逐漸升至三七九〇元，現永紗亦達三七〇〇元，掉期已昂。二三五號三六號七六號一五三號九九號八二號二二三號一一七號來賣，回挫至三六二〇元光景。現永紗亦由二三二號脫手，退至三五一〇元，一九八號八五號二〇三號一七九號二八號五七號二〇七號八九號二三二號二二四號九四號二〇二號八三號一五三號一四五號陸續買進，逐漸上升。憲警曾在塲參觀達半小時之久。但人心因龔某有掃數收現，及發行平行綫本票等訊，遞永紗漲到三八八〇元，九七號八九號二二號趁高了結，曾回降至三八一〇元，二二四號一一二號二〇七號九七號二一一號八三號六九號一九八號八九號再進，升爲三九六〇元，雖經一一七號二三一號四七號之了結，退爲三九一〇元，二〇七號二三一號三六號一九八號四號二三五號四八號一五四號再進，聞永紗有一變二十三增資決定訊。永業火柴，遞永公，統益，美亞，榮譽紛紛漲停。近午遞永紗連四一〇〇新高價，現永紗四〇〇〇元，九七號一一七號一四號逢高微售而稍盤，結果較前收計永紗信和升一成弱，美亞漲停，新華微升，中法華豐升半成左右，景福漲一成强。遞交計美亞漲停，永紗信和華　漲半成强，景福漲一成强，冷股榮豐統益火柴永業及遞交永公漲停，麗安絲業平穩，餘均漲起一成光景。永紗掉期由八十二元低價，逐步升至一〇五元外，銀行帮之貼進，爲數不多。多方若八九號一九八號一四號一一二號一七一號紛紛貼出，在一百元左右，曾由空方一三七號一五五號一五二號二一八號，以及金融帮五六號三一號二二〇號四五號四七號之貼進，略　掙扎。惟多方若一四五號等貼出不已，終以高價結束，合日息約九分左右。</p>
<p>午後　八五號二一七號均進，　永紗漲達四一四〇元新高價，二三一號八九號九七號一八〇號一四八號二一八號賣出，盤低至三九九〇元。一八五號一五四號九四號一四五號奮加維持，升爲四〇六〇元。三五號二三一號一八五號一四號八三號二〇七號一四九號一八六號均賣，降爲三九一〇元。八九號二一八號一七七號二八號六五號六九號一二九號一五四號一五五號等咸進。三時後，復抬高至四〇七〇元。九七號二三一號一四號二〇七號再迫低至三九二〇元，二一八號一五四號一八八號六　號一九九號八九號二三五號　　　　，臨收時又回升至四〇六〇元，而後稍平。結果較前收計永公美亞漲停，永紗信和升一成光景，景福漲成半不到，華　中法漲半成，新華微降，遞交計美亞永公漲停，永紗信和漲半成强，華豐微升。冷股榮豐中紡統益火柴永業漲停，大通迫近漲停後有回，軋升半成強。中絲商務平穩，內衣漲一成弱，水泥微挫，新亞跌半成。塲外各股仍吿微漲。</p>

<h3>社局首次拋售白米　塲外價續見挺升　米商請市長抑平產區價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕無錫等地產區米價，連日仍上升不已，影響所及，本市亦隨之帶高。頃　蔣主席所派調查糧價各專員已分抵各產地，以期切實抑低產地米價。市社會局配合該項措施，昨首次於市塲拋出白米二千包，中號西貢三千包及紅秈三千八百包。白米拋售價每石十三萬五千五，行交十四萬一千元，門售不得超過十五萬。西貢拋售價十一萬，行交十一萬六千五百元，門售不得超過十二萬五千元。紅秈拋售價十二萬零五百地，行交十二萬五千元，門售不得超過十三萬二千元。</p>
<p>昨南北兩市塲到貨登記祗二千七百餘石，白粳塲內仍為十四萬四千元，塲外則續見挺升。白陰元繼續狂漲萬元更秈米均少做開形勢仍在續漲不已，社會局拋米近萬包，遂得穩定。</p>
<p>米業負責人瞿振華華，徐頌仁，查寳三胡文安，胡咸剛五人，於昨晨九時，赴市府晋謁吳市長，陳訴米商目前之苦衷。良以產區價格連日在漲，米商實難以採運，望速予抑平產區價格。吳市長答稱：政府所派專員現已抵產區抑低復格，日內當可見效。市府並將每日拋售白米，西貢及紅秈。本市洋米存底甚豐，最近剛有四十五萬包抵滬，今後亦將源源運來。以之供應市民需要，決可維持至新穀登塲。故米價於數日內當可逐漸下跌。</p>
<p>洋米進口</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕洋米又有進口，招商局海　輪，前日傍晚抵滬，由暹羅運來食米二千零二十噸（即二萬零二百包），現靠中棧起卸。其中有五百二十噸，聞係暹羅政府贈與我政府，其餘一千五百噸係中信局採購。</p>

<h3>冰鮮魚貨業　昨突停交易</h3>
<p>最近上海市魚商業同業公會設立聯合收銀處，變更魚販付款辦法，因未得有關各方同意，引起魚販反對，相率停購魚貨，致昨日冰鮮魚無貨匯市。惟日來正値春魚旺汎，產銷雙方均不免蒙受不利影響。昨日下午二時，由社會局召集會議，計到魚商業同業公會代表張信昌等四人，魚販同人聯　會代表吳啓定等四人，海產運　聯合會代表蔣國　等四人，及魚市塲代表陸蔭初，凌安瀾協議解決方案。社局方面由　處長王科長出席，即席決定魚商業同業公會前定聯合收銀辦法暫緩實行，即日一律恢復交易，製成筆錄，由各負責代表簽字，此事已吿一段落。</p>

<p>據悉：漢口銀根奇緊，此間對漢口匯款匯費每千元已升至百元，中交等行，皆以漢口無頭寸，未能承認，桐油昨市已狂漲。足度桐油每担巳升至四十四萬元，西洪已超出四十萬以外，客貨存貨不膠，加以漢口桐油今市亦升至三十四萬元，人心趨堅，交易轉盛。</p>
<h3>煤斤到存均薄</h3>
<p>煤市去胃漸盛，人心堅秀。白煤焦作塊市上到存均簿，一經搜購，又吿缺貨。其他小礦白煤到貨斷續，品質差次，平時行市漫無標準。昨則較前喊高一二成。烟煤承前漲趨勢，市價繼續堅挺。開平一號層已升至七十四五萬元，二號層亦近七十萬元，低檔貨包山層，三十八萬元亦有大量成交。</p>
<h3>糖市趨勢平淡</h3>
<p>糖市日來趨勢極爲平淡，昨日提莊靑開盤廿一萬，退至廿萬〇九千元廿萬〇八千元，成交僅四五十包。漳刁靑初爲十九萬，降至十八萬八千，收盤爲十八萬九千元，成交二百六十包。興化白高貨三十萬，中廿九萬，興化赤高貨二十萬，成交無幾。</p>
<h3>食油雜糧等　實行禁運出口　昨日起恢復食油配售</h3>
<p>吳市長爲安定民食，鑒於食油及雜糧私運出口數量至鉅，曾電呈行政院禁止運銷出口，最近已由行政院會議通過，限制大豆，花生，芝麻，菜籽，棉籽，豆油，生油，芝麻油，菜油，棉油，等一律限制出口，吳市畏特與江海關商定，自即日起，公吿限制上項汕糧實行禁運出口。</p>
<p>食油聯配處於昨日起恢復配給，前往繳款領油之零售商，計有一百十三家，爲數並不踴躍，配價爲四十萬元一擔，門售不得超過每斤四千四百元之限價，今日繼續配售，黑市可望逐漸絕跡。</p>
<h3>外棉結匯付款國行規定辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本年二月至四月份外棉進口額美金四千萬元，業由國行與花旗銀行洽妥塡款辦法，各情已誌十五日本報。昨日國行特以第九十五號通函，分發各指定銀行，對該項外棉結匯付款辦法，規定八項，茲分誌如次：</p>

<h3>束手待斃與坐視不救</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>「束手待斃」當然不好，但是「坐視不救」也不行。</p>
<p>然而由於事實上的驅使，我們要走到「束手待斃」或則「坐視不救」的途徑了。這是什麽原故呢？因爲我們只要把報紙打開來看一看，差不多天天可以看見什麼庸醫殺人或則病人枉死的消息。假使我是病人，我不曉得有病要找那位醫師好，因爲今天是活神仙的醫師明天便變成殺人的庸醫了。那末敎我找誰呢？誰都是靠不住的醫師，那我豈還不是惟有束手待斃嗎？假使我是醫師，今天被人抬得半天高，說是什麼活神仙，而明天却又說是庸醫了。而且報上又登着許多什麽被控被拘被罰的消息，即使我沒有錯處，可是我嚇也嚇壞了，怎麽還有勇氣去看病呢？所以老於世故的醫師總是模稜兩可不着邊際。儘管你病人暗中吃虧，可是與我無涉，你捉不着我的把柄，我好好地賺我的錢你有什麽法子呢？唉！這眞是坐視不救的消極狀態。</p>
<p>「束手待斃」好嗎？當然不好。「坐視不救」好嗎？當然更加不好。那末怎麼樣呢？我以爲除了提高敎育程度努力灌輪醫學常識於民衆及要求我們醫師界的自肅與努力上進之外別無他法。</p>
<p>唉！看這批無知無識的芸芸衆生和那些只知刮錢而不知努力上進的江湖醫師，我惟有擲筆一嘆！</p>
<h3>談失眠及其療法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>「阿羅！怎麽你又睡着了？」</p>
<p>「唔，我萬事付之一睡。」</p>
<p>記得在三年前的初夏，我應聘赴白下出診一個傷寒病人。那時正是敵僞囂張的時代，我無論如何不肯前往，可是因爲老友羅君的苦苦央求，我只得應約前去。在病家一共住了十四天，等到病勢减退了，才得抽身回來。那時雖是初夏，可是白下的悶熟天氣却使人蒸鬱異常。每當我診務完畢之後，羅君便陪我在客廳裏聊天，可以說上天下地無所不談。然而談了三四天之後，便無題材可作談助了，於是我們兩人只好四目相注地天天悶坐在客廳裏度過那澳熱的下午，那眞是難受極了。但是我那位朋友「阿羅」呢倒是自得其樂地毫不介懷，只要你沒有話和他說了，他就靠着椅子呼呼地睡去，不管我有聊無聊。所以我在無聊到萬分的當兒，總是把他搖醒，呌他：「阿羅！怎麼你又睡着了？」那末他呢，老是兩眼微睜，笑嘻嘻地說了一句「唔，我萬事付之一睡。」</p>
<p>好，「萬事付之一睡，」這眞是幸福極了！眞是使我們睡不着的人豔羨之至。因此我特地檢了這箇題材「談失眠及其療法」來寫。這也許是患失眠的讀者們所要讀的吧。</p>
<p>我們大家普通總以爲陲眠是疲勞的結果，其實也未必盡然。根據生理方面的實騐，我們現在曉得在問腦附近的中腦隆起處有一個專司睡眠的神經中樞，（根據Economo氏之實騐報吿）。例如我們做一個動物試騐，在動物腦內的所謂睡眠神經中樞地方試用輕度的直流電刺激一下，或則用非常輕微的安眠藥塗在道個地方，那末這個動物馬上就睡着了。這種睡眠現象是與我們所知道的暈倒或昏迷或受麻醉以及精神病發作時的昏睡是完全兩樣的，因爲睡眠神經中樞受刺激後所發生的睡眠現象是隨時可以吵醒的，而暈倒昏迷以及受麻醉呢，却是不容易或則完全不能吵醒，根據這種實騐，我們就曉得睡眠神經中樞可以從大腦本身或則其他軀體各處得着各種不同的刺激而使牠發生睡眠作用。反過來說一句：假使這個睡眠神經中樞發生障碍失去牠的功能，那末就可發生失眠現象，所以凡是最嚴重的失眠症多半由於腦底本身發生障碍所致。此外我們也要曉得，有許多的失眠現象都是由於精神方面的暗示所引起的，因爲精神的刺激和心理方面的不安往往可以牽掣睡眠神經中樞的功能。譬如拿我們康健的人來說，只要把房間弄得黑暗一點，隔絕外界的嘈雜聲音和寬解太狹窄的衣服，那末就容易睡眠了。但是對於神經容易感受刺激的人呢，（例如精神病或神經衰弱症患者）那就兩樣了。引用上述的方法是不行的，我們必須要用其他的方法才行，例如生活的改善飲食的改良，心理暗示的改進和輕度安眠劑的應用以及物理療法的施用都是必需的。這種精神病的或神經衰弱的失眠症有牠惟一的特點，就是只要能够入睡，那末睡眠神經中樞就可以完全發揮牠的功能，使病者得着一箇合理的安眠。但是假使大腦受着鉅大的刺激或則大腦受了損傷，或則睡眠神經中樞發生障碍或則病者身受重大的痛苦，那末病者雖則能够入睡而不能熟睡，隨時都可以感受任何刺激而驚醒。這種失眠症的治法當然是從根源方面着手。如果是精神方面或則神經衰弱方面的失眠，那末當然從心理治療或則病原方面着手。如果是因爲病痛而起，那末我們只要想法治療那個病症，那末病者自然能够安眠。例如外傷中的折骨，膿瘍之發作以及拔出蛀牙之類，假使我們把他的痛楚止住了，那末病者自然可入睡的。又如患心臟病的人往往很難入睡，又如咳嗽甚劇的人也難入睡，而患狹心症的病者尤其難於安眠。假使我們把他的痛楚除去了，或則止住他的咳，恢復了他的心臟工作能力，那末病者雖然不服安眠劑也可以入睡了。假使用了上述的方法還沒有效力，那末我們只好乞靈於安眠劑了。這種安眠劑是直接减低大腦皮的感受刺激能力或則直接影響腦底本身使牠入睡。</p>
<p>我們大家都曉得老年人是不容易睡着，即使睡着了也容易驚醒的。這是什麽緣故呢？一方面固然由於生理方面的衰老所致，而他方面呢或許由於內分泌發生障碍或則血壓過高以及新陳代謝物的排洩作用失其效能所致。有許多老年人以爲他整夜未眠，每次的敲鐘都可以聽見。其實我們如果仔細觀察，那末他不過隨時驚醒而又隨時入夢罷了。對於這種失眠症我們切勿濫用安眠劑，因爲她會更加損害他的身體呢。</p>
<p>關於失眠症的治療方法，我以爲最先還是要用心理治療，飲食治療以及物理治療三者爲妥。假如使用得法，往往可以不必需要安眠劑。譬如睡前切勿進食，晚飯不可太飽，避免發酵的食物以及常通大便等事往往可使病者安眠。照我個人的經騐，睡前的溫水浴（攝氏表三十六度之溫水浴半小時）以及加氧氣或炭酸氣的溫水浴往往有很大的效力。此外如全身按摩，電氣透熱按摩以及直流電按摩等都有很好的效力。</p>
<p>至於安眠藥方面，我以爲可以分作四類：（一）輕度催眠劑，（二）眞正安眠劑（有較長之催眠作用），（三）老年人用的安眠劑（即催眠力量發作較遲而排洩於體外之時間亦較遲緩），（四）鎭靜劑，即爲减低大腦皮的刺激狀態之鎭靜劑，日間亦可照常服用，無損於日間之工作。有些藥物學專家把安眠劑分作兩種，一種是專門麻醉大腦皮的安眠劑，另一種是麻醉大腦底本身的東西，如果份量用得太大，那末可以攻擎延腦而使之呼吸停止。關於麻醉大腦皮的安眠劑是酒精，Chloralhydrat，Paraldehyd及溴劑之類。關於大腦底本身的安眠劑是屬於Luminal　Veronal，Baldrian，Pernokton，Somnifen一類的東西。我們在使用時一定要加以充份考慮和選擇，否則是很容易弄成意外的錯誤。有許多人隨便給以病者以大量的安眠劑，這實在是一種錯誤，因為一則導引病者服毒自殺的危險，而二則可以引起病者常服的習慣。我曾親眼看見一位太太，她失眠三年，服安眠藥由一片加至三片，每夜非安眠藥不能入睡。後來有一次我們大家同作一次長途的旅行，因爲長途的跋涉，使她過度的感覺疲乏，沒有服用安眠劑就呼呼地睡着了。從此之後，她就沒有用過安眠劑。由此推論，安眠劑往往是被人濫用了的。我們做醫師的難道不應該愼重考慮與選擇這個安眠劑嗎？至於安眠劑的藥性問題，因屬於專門性及簾幅關係只好從略，留待下次有機會時再談吧！</p>
<h3>新中醫之謎（三）</h3>
<p>— 洪貫之</p>
<p>今陸君却要借重客觀實騐的「經騐」，附會到中醫去，於是好誇張中醫的經騐之可貴，表面上似亦言之成理，可惜陸君仍忽略了「經騐」的本質，只在字面上用功夫，所以說來說去，還是無補於事；須知新哲學上的「經騐」，旣非指主觀空想的結果而言，雖然中文也譯作經騐，實際上名同實異，中醫之所謂經驗，並沒有經過客觀的實騐，這是事實，當然不是可貴的經騐了，豈能因有客觀的經騐，就不承認中醫自身的經騐是主觀的呢！老實說：中醫的所謂「經騐」只是個人的「經歷」，並不是余先生「把經騐的範圍弄得狹之又狹」，而是事實如此，嚴格言之：中醫的經騐，實在不配稱爲經騐，爲什麼呢？客觀的經騐，不用說，就是主觀的經騐，也須在同一主觀觀點之下，有共同認識，不會兩歧的。譬如說：日東出而西沒，是經總，現在曉得是地球自轉，而不是眞的「日出」「日入」，但是東升西沒的事實，是無可否認的，也決沒有一個人會說是西出而東沒的，太陽也從來沒有例外的會「出於西而沒於東」的，所以這種經騐，雖非可貴，但也並不離事實太遠，不過沒有說着事實本體的眞相罷了。可是中醫的所謂經騐，就與此大大不同了，一種病可以說他是痰，是風，是濕，是火，各人辨症論斷，可以各不相同，然而他們也都自稱爲經騐，這只是「個人的主觀」，決不能稱爲「經騐」。此外又把偶然和例外之事，也附會上去，所以經騐也就更多了。譬如說：婦人尺脉滑則爲有胎，脉數也是有胎，……但是我們曉得，這種例子並不常見，有的姙婦脉滑，有的絕對不滑也不數，所以滑和數，只能看做偶發，不能作爲標準，因爲大家都不一致。這種例子，雖然都是由經歷得來的結果，但是和日東出而西沒的主觀經驗，也不能相提並論，因爲這種辨症的經驗，不是大家公認的，太不可靠了，所以都不得稱爲經騐。中醫的一切論症施治，均是捕風捉影之談，從來沒有把治療對象，就是病的本質，弄淸楚，所有處理病的方法和結果，（療法和治績及藥效的評判），也就變成不盡可靠的紀錄了，那裏還能說他是一稱學問呢？還有許多例子，就是觀察錯誤的結果，譬如我們看到羊癎風的病人，倒在路傍，有人給他喝了一碗姜湯之後，就好了，這似乎是事實，應該是千眞萬確的「經騐」吧？可是事實上，却又偏偏不是這樣，你如果碰到另一個羊癎風病人的時候，同探也給他一碗姜湯，他却依舊繼續發他的瘋，這樣來，姜湯的功用，也就靠不住了！我們曉得中醫所稱的經騐，治績，像這樣的例子極多，有的人把他紀錄起來，成爲「騐案」或則「經騐」良方，這個經驗的價値。實在令人可疑！（事實上並不全部靈騐）如果這種經騐，也値得寳貴的話，那麽神廟中的偶像，也是很靈騐的。你看每個神廟裏面掛滿了朱漆金字的匾額，眞是「威靈顯赫」，這種匾額，都是神和佛弟子們誠心祈禱之後，得到了效果（？）在鑼鼓喧天爆竹震地的聲中，送進去的，並不是那一家廟宇的和尙或香火，自己掛起來嚇人或騙人的，話說起來，很爲簡單，這就呌適逢其會的「碰巧」。也就是倖中偶合而已，沒有什麽了不起的。只有藥物的效用，其中有一部（並不是全部）是經過多數人試騐而得到的結果，這雖可以稱他是「經騐」的產物，但也是主觀的經騐，也只能「認識現象，而不能認識本質，」與事實眞相，還是有相當距離的；這種只知當然面不明所以然的成績，也不過是一種常識罷了。（待續）</p>
<h3>麻疹併發呼吸系疾病之防治法</h3>
<p>— 許樹屛</p>
<p>麻疹俗稱厝子，是現時期流行甚廣之急性傳染病，患者之死亡率，根據臨證統計，常與併發呼吸系疾病，直接成正比例。凡患者能同時不發生呼吸系症病，其經過往往順利，而無任伺危險；倘在皮疹消退時，高熱依然不退，即爲發生併發病之微兆，則未雨綢繆，預防呼吸系疾病之發生，實爲治療本症舟之要訣。茲將症狀及防治法，簡述於後：</p>
<p>（一）喉頭炎Laryngitis</p>
<p>患麻疹者，大都有喉頭炎，其症狀爲（A）嘶嘎（B）嗽聲如犬吠（C）有呼吸性喉笛音。此時應作白喉菌之培養檢査，以資鑑別，因眞性白喉症，亦可併發於麻疹。</p>
<p>防治法　煮水於壺中，引氣至床帳內，在開水壺內加一茶匙複方安息香浸酒Tr．Benzoin　Co．功效更佳。</p>
<p>（二）枝氣管肺炎Broncho-pneumonia　　麻疹併發肺炎，在病理上屬於間質性肺炎，是最危險的合併症，其症狀如下，（A）呼吸急促，及咳嗽窘迫，（B）唇及指甲發靑紫色，（C）體溫突高至40度左右，（D）肺部物理徴顯明，（E）白血球總數增多，分類上中性多核白血球顯著增加。</p>
<p>防治法　病室內人數愈少愈妙，戚友訪問，不令任意入內，家人及僕役等，與患者接觸時，須即洗手，並帶口罩。麻疹診斷確定後，即開始服預防劑量磺屬化學藥品，可避免肺炎之發生，但肺炎旣經發生，則治療須用大量磺咹屬化學藥品及注射配尼西林Penicillin</p>
<p>（三）膿胸Empyema　麻疹病人，患肺炎後，常併發膿胸其症象如下，（A）發熱及中膿毒現象，（B）呼吸困難，及靑紫徵，（C）白血球顯著增加，（D）胸部物理徽明顯，（E）X光及施行胸腔穿刺衛後，診斷可以確定。</p>
<p>防治法　能先防止肺炎，即可避免膿胸之併發，治以重複吸引法，及注入配尼西林。</p>
<p>（四）肺結核Pulmonary　Tuberculosis　病兒曾受結核菌傳染者，一經發生麻疹，其抵抗力减低，常能使潛伏體內之結核菌，突圖而出，倘溢出之結核菌侵入血管，可隨血液流至週身各部，而發生粟粒形肺結核，其症狀如下，（A）不規則發熱，持久不退，（B）脈搏加速，（C）面色蒼白，精神不振，（D）體重日减，（E）脾臟腫大，査肺部常無物理　，（F）菌素測騐呈正反應，倘溢出之結核菌，大部份侵入肺組織；則成結核性乾酪樣肺炎，其症狀與物理徵，頗似肺炎，但病期延長，治療無效，此時宜藉白血球檢騐X光透視，及結核菌素測騐等術，可與非結核性肺炎有所鑑別。</p>
<p>防治法　換近患者之人，愈少愈好，凡父母及僕役，或親友中患有肺結核症者，尤須絕對禁止與之接近，他若營養充足，日光照射，與空氣新鮮等，亦屬重要，而鏈徽素Streptomycin可以試用，但此病之預後，大都極爲不良。</p>

<h3>重逢</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>武漢一天嚴重一天，空襲幾乎每日不斷，人心惶惶，誰也沒法安於工作，甚而生活。</p>
<p>戲園子已經停演了，麗華只好歇在家裏。忽然一個晚上，寶鈴回來約她去慰問一位受傷的空軍戰士，說是就在武漢上空與敵機作戰被擊落受傷的。但若不告訴她受傷的空軍是誰，認識或不認識，直拉了她就走。對於這類的事，她總是義不容辭的，因此也便不去多所追問。</p>
<p>在一間朝着長江的病房裏，窗外是一片月光和白浪，窗下就睡着麗華他們要慰問的空軍。</p>
<p>護士小姐把麗華和寶鈴帶進病房以後，輕輕招呼了受傷的空軍，病人微微應了一聲。寶鈴　着麗華走近床前，親切地呌着：</p>
<p>「國棟」！</p>
<p>麗華不覺愣了一下，這名字哆熟！可是乍又想不起在什麽地方聽過？連忙注視病人的面龐，濃眉大眼，厚厚的嘴唇，唇上兩撇雜亂的鬍鬚，就為了這兩撇鬚，模糊了她的印象—看上半部，仿佛曾相識，但下半部陌生得很—「是誰呢？」「是誰？」她努力地追思，愈急愈沒辦法，愈沒辦法她愈要用心地注視。宛如她遺忘了一句或一段的戲詞，她必須再把它抓回記憶裏來，她不能承認她的腦筋已經失去靈活！</p>
<p>「你，」病人遲疑地問着，有些迷茫的神氣。</p>
<p>「不認得我了嗎？廖棟—我是寶鈴，你的老朋友，還有，我的妹妹，麗華也來看你了！」寶鈴較詳細地自我介紹着。</p>
<p>「寶鈴！」病人驚喜地半笑了起來，「是你，寶鈴！寶鈴！」</p>
<p>他們擁抱了！他們都落了淚！</p>
<p>這一來麗華明白了，從他們的熱情，從他們的哭聲中，她的記憶裏浮現了那個曾使她無動於心的天真活潑而純樸上進的靑年——哥哥的好朋友；也是哥哥的主人；呌廖棟；一個苦命的孩子，和哥哥以及自己有着同樣不幸遭遇的苦命的孩子！「不錯，就是他！就是他！」這樣想，她有些歉然地走近幾步，也有些感動地眼眶開始濕潤。</p>
<p>「她，」廖棟這才抬頭注意了麗華。</p>
<p>「我妹妹，你見過的，而且聽過她的戲！」寶鈴又一次拉住了麗華向廖棟介紹。</p>
<p>廖棟精神有些恍惚，先怔了怔，像是很快地思想了一會兒，然後興奮地伸出手來。</p>
<p>「不錯！不錯！我們見過，見過。」廖棟說着，心裏一陣熱，兩顋立刻飛紅。</p>
<p>廖棟的羞澀，更熟稔地喚回麗華的記憶，而且有力地吸住了她，她緊握着廖棟，用微笑說明着無限的關懷，和愛慕。</p>
<p>「您受傷了？」麗華囁嚅地說。</p>
<p>「不要緊，只是皮膚上一點傷，心臟受了些微震動！現在已經都快恢復了。」廖棟很恬然地回答。努力用歡樂的情緒掩飾身體上的痛苦。</p>
<p>「昨天看見報上登着你受傷的消息，真急壞我了！所以今天就帶麗華來看了，」寶鈴說。「旣然快恢復了，那麽出院以後到我們家休養一個時期。」</p>
<p>「好的，出院以後我有一個月的假期，我一定去和你們好好地玩玩。尤其是麗華小姐的戲，我要多多領教，為了六年前在此地連着聽了幾次麗華小姐的戲，引起我濃厚的興趣。後來在南京在杭州我都不斷地聽戲，不但聽，我還學唱，學拉胡琴。我們航校有一個票友社，我也加入了，而且居然登過台。我常常想：有一天我能和麗華小姐同台演一次　，那才好哩！」廖棟越說越高興，好像已經忘記了自己是個病人。精神也不再恍惚了。</p>
<p>「啊，想不到五六年不見，你變成了一位飛將軍，一位名票友了！真是『士別三日刮目相看』哩！」寶鈴打趣地說。</p>
<p>「麗華小姐，等我好了，我來拜你為師，你願意收我這一個徒弟嗎？」廖棟認真地問着。</p>
<p>「不敢當，廖先生！」麗華搖搖頭回答。</p>
<p>寶鈴明白麗華最怕人提唱戲的事，因此連忙岔開話題，和廖棟談了些五六年中各自的生活狀況。直至護士小姐來催促了，寶鈴和麗華才告辭。臨行時廖棟熱情地握住麗華請她再來。麗華滿口答應着離開了廖棟。不知怎的華麗心裏有些依依之感，說不淸是為了廖棟是一個抗戰英雄呢？還是為了廖棟和寶鈴的友誼？抑為了自己敬佩他，甚而愛他？</p>
<p>同樣地，廖棟目送麗華去後惶惶然若有所失，精神又陷入迷茫狀態！他努力把幾年來默默追求中的對象和今天重逢的麗華聯想在一起！他覺得麗華比此前更美，更可愛！而且他覺得麗華比從前待他好了，於是他震奮地渴望着趕快恢復健康，趕快實現憧憬的幸福！他已經等候了六年，私戀了六年，他將用最大的勇氣，像衝鋒陷陣一樣，去爭取那夢寐了六年的有光有熱的春天！</p>
<p>宛如一顆無聲的炸彈，把麗華久已關閉了的感情之門又轟開了！一個巨大的幻象闖進來，它是那麽有力地騷擾了平靜的心海！而且緊緊扣緊了她的靈魂！像影子一般牢牢地釘住她的眼；她的耳；無處不看見它；聽到它；於是她感覺到一種從所未有的興奮，這興奮使她輾轉床榻，通宵失眠！她還不能理出一條明朗的思路，安定自己，她直想到必須接受和容忍這個突兀的襲擊，必須與那幻象擁抱！</p>
<p>過了兩天麗華又單獨去看望廖棟，並帶了些餅亁蛋糕之類的點心，樂得廖棟幾乎從床上跳下來！麗華連忙按住廖棟，悄悄更為這種熱情感動。</p>
<p>廖棟像一個孩子似的問着麗華許多關於京劇的問題，麗華耐煩地回答他，雖然自己對京戲毫無興趣。</p>
<p>「為什麽你這樣喜歡京劇？」麗華有些好奇地問。</p>
<p>「因為京劇也是藝術，我愛藝術。再就因為你——」廖棟脫口而出。</p>
<p>「因為我？」麗華不禁驚訝起來。</p>
<p>「是的，因為你的藝術給了我極深刻的印象，所以，我更愛你的藝術！」說到最後廖棟的臉又紅了！其實他是想告訴麗華：因為愛麗華才愛京劇。可是他不敢，他已經盡了很大的勇氣了。</p>
<p>麗華明白廖棟的意思，不便追究下去，訕訕地走到窗前，眺望那江面盪漾着的一艘艘航船，遠似一片片落葉，近似一隻隻白鷗！這時她遐想有一天能像落葉那麽輕鬆地漫無邊際地飄流，能像白鷗那麽自由地飛到天盡頭！忽然，她聽見空中「隆隆」作響，幾批鐵鳥翱翔於雲霓間，接着汽笛哀鳴，她以為是洋輪開駛。</p>
<p>「糟！又有空襲了！」廖棟說，「你趕快回去吧。」</p>
<p>「空襲？」麗華震驚了一下，但還不太相信。</p>
<p>「已經拉了警報了。」廖棟有些氣忿地邊說邊向窗外晴空瞭望。</p>
<p>「你怎麽辦？」麗華想走，又遲疑地止住了步。</p>
<p>「我就躺在這裏，反正沒地方躲。」廖棟悻悻地回答。</p>
<p>「那麽我陪你，反正我回去也是沒地方躲。」麗華說着恭然地坐在廖棟的床沿。</p>
<p>在漢口確是沒地方躲空襲，每次警報只能到租界上避避。人們迷信租界，特別迷信租界上的外國教堂，麗華就是經常蜷伏在一家教堂的屋簷下。因為她最膽小，警報一響，她便跑到教堂；敵機一臨空，她便塞住耳朶；炸彈一爆烈，她便扑在地上了；直至警報解除，她才敢站起來；而全身還哆嗦個不休。</p>
<p>但今天很例外，麗華居然勇敢了，她竟陪伴廖棟不動聲色地留在醫院裏。她仿佛隱隱之中感到一種保障，她覺得廖棟不僅不怕敵機，而且還打敵機，她旣不能「打」敵機至少也不應「怕」敵機！因此，她迫使自己的心靈堅強起來！也許正為了以上的原故，她越發敬重廖棟了，她想：她愛護一個能打敵機的人，未嘗不就是她間接地打敵機！想到這裏，她對於今天的陪伴廖棟感到非常有價值，有意義！</p>
<p>「你平時也不躲？」廖棟聽見麗華要陪伴自己，又喜又驚異。</p>
<p>「不躲。」麗華偽心地搖搖頭說。</p>
<p>「你不怕嗎？」</p>
<p>「不怕。」麗華裝出絕對鎮靜的神氣回答。</p>
<p>他們的話剛完，緊急警報和敵機「嗡嗡」聲同時交響，接着轟炸開始，一顆巨彈仿佛就落在附近，震動得屋宇搖幌，窗玻璃「嘩嘩啦啦」碎片飛揚，麗華不能自制地抖搜了，雖然她勉強不塞耳朶，不扑到地上。</p>
<p>「轟隆！轟隆！」又是幾下子。</p>
<p>「快爬到地下。」廖棟一邊嚷着一邊把麗華往地上一推，自己就扑在麗華的身上。</p>
<p>等到一陣瘋狂的轟炸過去之後，便是上空激烈的戰鬥聲，機關槍，高射砲「劈劈拍拍」響個不休，天地都被像要被傾覆的樣子。</p>
<p>忽然天空一片紅光，黑煙冲向雲層，像濃霧，幾支火箭似的東西從窗前掠過。</p>
<p>「她媽的，敵機打落了！」廖棟緊張地呌着。</p>
<p>果然，一駕太陽徽號的敵機殘骸，落到江面上，還冒着煙，燃着火！</p>
<p>「好哇！」廖棟興奮地喝着彩。</p>
<p>廖棟的話一直沒有回應，他剛才憑經騐上的聽覺，辨明了敵機的被擊落，如今又憑感覺，知道麗華已經嚇昏了！他急忙想站起來，但是他的腰被兩隻手緊緊地懷抱着。他輕輕抽動一下。</p>
<p>「麗華！」廖棟第一次這樣喊着。</p>
<p>「嗯！」麗華應了聲，像從夢中醒來，睜開惺忪的眼睛。</p>
<p>「敵機打落了。起來休息休息吧！」</p>
<p>「噢！」</p>
<p>麗華這才漸漸恢復神智，也才發現自己的身上壓着一個男人，這男人是以一種掩護的姿勢爬在上面的，同時，自己還緊緊抱着這男人，她稍稍注視了一下對方，於是趕快鬆了手，又羞又感激地說：</p>
<p>「噯呀，你也下來了！」</p>
<p>「剛才轟炸的太厲害，我怕彈片飛進來傷了你，所以扑在你身上了！」廖棟邊說邊扶着床沿站起來。</p>
<p>麗華也站了起來，連忙扶持廖棟躺下去。</p>
<p>「可是，你忘了你自己！」麗華說這話時聲音低得幾乎聽不見。</p>
<p>「是的，我忘了我自己！」廖棟似強調又似沉吟地重覆着。</p>
<p>他們相顧微微一笑，千言萬語盡在一笑中！也就在那一霎時的患難裏面，他們的情誼像赤金經了火煉，像涉過千山萬水的程序，他們的心融在一起了，他們的愛，突破有形的時間與空間，而凝固了！</p>
<p>一陣緊張之後，廖棟在靜穆中才意識到自己是一個病人，才又感覺着傷處的微痛。麗華從他精神的萎靡，和臉上的氣色看出他的不舒服，於是給他倒了杯茶，默默坐在一邊，直至他疲憊地也許是安定地朦朧睡着了。</p>
<p>這時，警報已經解除了，麗華替廖棟把被子蓋好，然後悄悄離開病房。首先，她載着滿腹的愉快找到劉子雲，適巧董劭凌也在。她毫不避迴地把這兩天的遭遇報告給他們，雖然她也曾害羞地臊得幾乎說不下去，但終於有一種力量鼓舞了她，這力量在她的經騐中還沒有過，她覺得這力量是她生死的關鍵，假如她希望有一天她的身體和靈魂得救，那麽能夠救她的就是這力量，這神聖的愛的力量！</p>
<p>劉子雲和董劭凌一致贊頌麗華的遭遇，鼓勵她千萬把握這幸福的序曲，他們都給了她勇氣，特別是董劭凌，更興奮地督促她，勸她不可坐失良機！</p>
<p>「世界上，只有靑年人的感情最純真；最熱烈；所以最值得珍貴。一個中年人，因為生活進入實際的階段，於是連愛，都要計算了。而且也不敢愛了！」董劭凌用說教的口吻向麗華表示非常理智的意見。</p>
<p>麗華對於董劭凌的話半懂不懂，心裏想：董劭凌所謂中年人也許就是說的自己，但無論如何，對於董劭凌她是始終信任並敬慕的，她承認董劭凌過去確是不敢愛她，然而，她並不因此恨董劭凌。</p>
<p>「那麽，我信你們的話，開始愛他，也永遠愛他了！」麗華按耐着心跳勇敢地像起誓一般地說。</p>
<p>「對！能這樣，你將得到不朽的幸福！」董劭凌如釋重荷地愉快地說。</p>
<p>「但是前途還有障碍，我必須先瞞着我媽！」</p>
<p>麗華的話不錯，墨太太就是她和廖棟的障碍，但她已在時刻地用心防備這障碍，她估計有一天她也會勇敢地突破這障碍。</p>
<p>接着，麗華又奔馳於醫院許多次，而且又和廖棟共了許多次的患難，直至廖棟傷愈，搬出醫院，住她的家裏，他們更密切地親近了一個時期。除了墨太太，差不多沒有人不曉得他們的相愛，寶鈴自然是贊助人之一，麗雲更熱心非常。即如金麒麟，也以老朋友；老同事；老大哥的身份在一邊大吹大擂，希望這齣「龍鳳呈祥」能夠演唱成功，自己則可以客串一個趙雲的角色。</p>
<p>於是，麗華和廖棟在一片拉合聲中進行着友誼；進行着愛；進行着一個更遠；更寬；更結實的共同生活之路！</p>
<p>廖棟的身體還沒有完全復原，特別是心臟方面還有些衰弱。他利用假期休養，在休養中同時為一個幸福的目標努力競爭。因此偶然遇到一些困難，即感到刺激！這情形只有寶鈴了解，寶鈴拿十餘年前在荊州勸過他的話又來忠告他。</p>
<p>「堅定意志！堅定意志身心便會強健起來！」寶鈴字字斬釘截鐵地說。</p>
<p>果然廖棟又像十餘年前對待那個腐爛的家庭一般態度，對於戀愛也堅定了！儘管前途還渺茫得很！但他已「堅定」了「有志者事竟成」的信心。他信賴自己；也信賴各個幫助的朋友；尤其信賴莫逆之交的寶鈴。</p>
<p>麗華在同樣心情下接受着一個新的命運！她改變了歷年沉默寡言笑的態度，她和廖棟，寶鈴，麗雲，三個人忘其所以地玩，無猜地談，像靑梅竹馬時代，恢復了天真，恢復了活潑！</p>
<p>好事多磨，武漢疏散令下了，廖棟不得不奉命提前歸隊。麗華也不得不隨着劉子雲大家買舟西上。</p>
<p>遽聚復遽離，只好互道「後會有期」。麗華的心上又蒙上一層憂鬰的網！</p>
<h3>花鳥</h3>
<p>— 紅薇老人</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　319</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「十分抱歉，鶴見先生……。」</p>
<p>這洪亮的嗓音，打在鶴見耳鼓上，呌他精神一振，立即恢復了正常的視覺和聽覺。他看見面對他站着的，是一位瘦削的老人，顎下垂着一部尺多長的白髯，穿着一身韓人的舊式紳士服裝，眼光顯得十分的鬰沉。同時鶴見又發見他自己的右手，被兩隻極滑潤的柔荑握住，正在替他切着脈搏。</p>
<p>「一切都正常了爸爸。」嚦嚦的罵聲，從鶴見身旁發出；話未說畢，那捉着鶴見右手的一雙柔荑早已輕輕縮去，人也立了起來。在鶴見的眼中，她是一位二十一二歲的嬌好女子，也穿着高麗服裝。</p>
<p>「很好，孩子，你可以退下了。」老人操着不純正的日本語音，邊說邊揮着手，神色仍舊那般鬱沉。</p>
<p>鶴見一壁瞧那女子退出室去，一壁挪正了自己坐的姿勢，順便打量了一下這屋子中的情形。看那佈置，知道這是一間客室。</p>
<p>「鶴見先生，我想我應當充分解說幾句……」老人在鶴見對面坐下了。</p>
<p>「不必……！」鶴見發命令似的，截斷了老人的話，「我問一句，請你答應一句；因為我的時間寶貴極了。」鶴見瞧了瞧腕上的錶。</p>
<p>「尊命，」老人的語意，雖然十分　和，但說話的態度，配合着那洪鍾似的嗓音，無形中也顯示了一種高貴的身份。</p>
<p>「你們這裏有電話？」</p>
<p>「有的，可是……」</p>
<p>「請你招呼我那位伴當來！」</p>
<p>老人沒有則聲，只輕輕拍了兩下掌。掌聲未已，早有人推門進來，卻是一個精壯的小夥子。老人且不吩咐那小夥子什麽，先向鶴見告罪，「這孩子不懂日語，請不要見怪。」說畢，又操着自己本鄉語言，說了兩句，小影子應聲而去。</p>
<p>「你們這裏離開國際大旅舍很遠嗎？」鶴見問着。</p>
<p>「十五分鍾汽車的路程。」</p>
<p>「你們車子裏用的麻醉劑，對於人身的健康有很大妨害嗎？」</p>
<p>「毫不妨害健康；我本人就是醫藥技師，也是醫生。這一條可以担保。」</p>
<p>「我已經對貴部下，表示了坦白，為什麽仍舊要開這種不必要的手續？」</p>
<p>「孩子們的行動，沒有自由，十分抱歉……」</p>
<p>老人話未說畢，那小夥子已經領着正岩進來了。</p>
<p>「正岩君，請先打一個電話到萬歲館，問我們那間屋子當值的下女，中村小姐的消息；再打電話到你預定的地方，告訴他們招待你的朋友，假使我們來不及趕到的話—現在已經三點哪！」</p>
<h3>鄧南遮不知足</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>被稱為當代義大利的詩人，小說家，劇作家，藝術家，飛行家，兵士，戀愛者，夢幻者……的鄧南遮（Gabriele　D'Annuzio　186　—）真是一個了不起的人物。在第一次世界大戰時，他曾跟法國幫過些忙，所以在後來，法國的人都很敬重他；寫信給他的人，都只寫「義大利最偉大的詩人收。」鄧南遮似乎感到不滿足，他說：「我豈只是意大利偉大的詩人，你們還該稱我世界上最偉大的詩人咧！」</p>
<h3>沙士比亞：十四行詩</h3>
<p>— 真勤試譯</p>
<p>第十八首</p>
<p>能不能讓我把你比作　日？</p>
<p>你比它更加可愛，更家溫婉：</p>
<p>狂風會吹落五月底好花兒，</p>
<p>夏季底壽命又過分的短暫：</p>
<p>天底隻眼有時照得太灼熱，</p>
<p>它金色的面孔也會被遮暗；</p>
<p>每樣美終須離開美而凋落，</p>
<p>被機會或自然底代謝擾亂。</p>
<p>但是，你不會失去你占有的美麗，</p>
<p>你底永久的夏天也決不會凋零；</p>
<p>「死」不敢請說你流落在他底影里，</p>
<p>當你在不朽的詩中與時間永生。</p>
<p>只要人類不滅，眼睛不失明。</p>
<p>我這詩也活着，付你以生命。</p>
<p>第二十九首</p>
<p>當我失去了幸福，又遭人白眼，</p>
<p>而獨自哭泣我被遺棄的處境，</p>
<p>白用哭喊來麻煩聾耳的上天，</p>
<p>又看看自己，詛咒自己底命運；</p>
<p>希望自己是個更有希望的人，</p>
<p>能活得像他一樣，有很多友伴，</p>
<p>要有這人底技藝，那人底學問，</p>
<p>於自己平日所得意的，卻不滿；</p>
<p>但是想到這些，我真輕視自己，</p>
<p>我偶而想到你——於是我底心境</p>
<p>就像一隻雲雀在黎明時飛起，</p>
<p>離開了暗地，在天門旁邊歌吟；</p>
<p>因為我回憶你底甜愛如財產，</p>
<p>呌我不屑把　境跟帝王對換。</p>
<p>第三十三首</p>
<p>很多次我看見那輝煌的早晨</p>
<p>用他威　的隻眼　婚着牽鳳，</p>
<p>用金色的面頰吻着　的草坪，</p>
<p>用仙術把暗的溪流鍍成金泉；</p>
<p>忽而他　　車劣的霞彩連同</p>
<p>醜惡的　片馳上他神聖的臉，</p>
<p>使寂寞的歷世不見他底面孔，</p>
<p>同時他偷偷地西沉，帶着汚點。</p>
<p>同樣，一天淸早，我底太陽升起，</p>
<p>把萬丈光華射到我額角上來，</p>
<p>但，睹了，唉，他祇屬於我一瞬息；</p>
<p>邊界上的雲早把他和我遮開。</p>
<p>但，我對他的愛毫不因此冷淡，</p>
<p>天上的太陽會暗，地上的，當然。</p>

<h3>市容</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>城市的建設，都原於歷史，地理，政治，經濟以及學術文化，而造成各種不同的形式，中國用城牆堡壘，民間房屋也用高牆深院，　　鐵窗，欄杆憑弔，朱門金字，車輕馬肥，這都是封建時代的生活。</p>
<p>歐洲中世紀的城市，也是狹隘的石路，房屋陰森，古堡堅牆厚壁，處處露出戰爭的痕跡；到文藝復興的城市，好像花朶吐出嫩瓣，宮殿樓閣，日趨華麗，堡壘形式，作為裝飾品，城市與民居連成一體，商市漸漸繁榮，所謂市容，亦因而顯著。</p>
<p>城市的建築物，最偉大的，就是廟宇官府之類，近代則注重公共生活，與文化事業，如博物院，國家大戲院，大學校，圖書館，博士院，這些建築物，在城市中心，已成形人民公有的寶庫，非帝王貴族時代的產物，市容也就不同了。</p>
<p>中國城市中，所謂高大建築，除了廟宇官府之外，民間房屋，沒有什麽偉大的建築，且色彩更不講究，用木料更不堅固，富有者，只有一層樓閣，在高處瞭望，都是一片平屋，黑白如同木耳煮豆腐，市容也就平淡無奇。</p>
<p>城市中最大的建築物，是提高市民的精神，如同北歐哥特式教堂，在濃霧陰雨的天氣，遙遠只看見教堂的高塔，我們就知道這高塔的教堂，必是城鎮的中心，附近必定有公園，市塲，郵局，咖啡館，以及學校市府等，這種高塔是北歐的產物，南歐天氣明媚，只講求裝飾門面，充實內容，與北歐情形，大不相同。</p>
<p>歐洲近瑞士阿爾布斯山一帶，因山湖風景美麗，形成各種市容，近地中海尼司蒙拉哥一帶，滿山滿野，都是奇卉香花，法國供給全世界的香水香皂等，皆取材於此，意大利古代城市，欲保存古蹟，他們把整個城市，不使他變更，吾人游行街市，恍如中世紀的人民，雖然是封建時代產物，但都變成博物院美術品，祇留下形式欣賞，精神異常愉快。</p>
<p>中國的市容，以官府為集中點，廟宇多在荒僻之地，建築物，到處都是一樣格式，沒有多大變化，也不因為史地文物與生產職業的關係，有特殊的創造，譬如海邊的城市，與山上的城市，沒有多大區別，即如杭州與蘇州，雖然風雅，但城市並沒有特別在市容上，創造出特殊的風格，北平有些大建築物，而城市依然是大同小異。</p>
<p>我所講市容，如同人的孔面，一見即可識別是那種人物。歷史性，地方性，總要保留，以及民情風俗文物教化，都要形成一都市的特殊精神，這種精神，融會貫通在人類文化史上，是有特殊的價值！崑山為什麽沒有崑曲研究會，南京為什麽沒有六朝文藝，西安為什麽沒有考古學會，北平為什麽沒有國立大戲院，上海是太平洋上大商埠，為什麽沒有世界博物館，為什麽不創造出國際的文化城？</p>
<p>市容是活的，不是死的，就是保存一座古城，把殘壞建築物，要照古代格式重修起來，還是活的文化！還是現在活人來欣賞，來研究，來重新創造，市容如同人面孔，有表情，有修養，是一位活潑潑的有血性的面孔，好像一個學者，世界各國都去過，這一位面孔，當然有不同的風趣品格，市容也是一樣，是拿歷史，地理，政治，經濟以及一切文化學術，造鮮一種美麗的市容！</p>

<h3>愛琳鄧在「　雨姻緣」中</h3>
<h3>海外來鴻</h3>
<p>— 新子</p>
<p>在英實習海軍的現狀</p>
<p>××兄：</p>
<p>正在忙着收拾行李的時候，忽然接到您的來信，我高興極了。我絲毫不能用我這枝禿筆將我的高興快樂的心境描寫出來。承你的美意，將國內的消息及朋友們的近況告訴我，我將不知如何的感謝您，您大概很關心我的生活吧？現在，讓我來告訴您，我們在英國軍艦上受訓的情形吧。並望寄語那些我很懷念的朋友們</p>
<p>初到這裏，我們終日過着操塲上的生活，自朝至暮，我們均在緊張愉快的情形下。六個禮拜以後，我們的入伍訓練結束了，將又是一種新的生活開始，終日上講堂，生活較在操塲訓練的時候舒服得多。英國人做事真是腳踏實地，比我們要澈底得多。譬如上午上甲種課程，下午馬上到Cinema看電影——，英國人將海軍一切動作皆製成影片。次日，即須親自實習，此種教育的效果來得很大。同時，這種方法，很值得我國採納。六個禮拜的課堂生活以後，我們舉行了一次總考。成績很引起英人的驚奇。據其中一位司密士的教官說，像我們這六個星期的課程，英國士兵是決不能接受的。殊不知道，我們都是一批學生，在英國士兵中受教育的程度，僅不過小學而已，凡有中學程度的皆是軍官，與我國情形相仿，英人皆認為中國士兵素質不差，郵只有天知道。</p>
<p>在英國，當一個軍人，到處受人家歡迎，一個人服兵役，全家都感受到光榮，同時，每個士兵的待遇，都可供養他的眷屬；而且，可以生活在相當優裕的境地裏，每隔三月，即有一次Long　Leave（約兩週）。與中國士兵相比，真有天壤之別。但英國領土僅有三島，物資猶不足自給，一切均仰殖民地的供給，為什麽他們能把國家治得這樣井井有條哩？假如我國的政治，人民也和英國一樣，不是一樣是世界的頭等國家嗎？英國黨派也相當的複雜，也在相互競爭之中，但他們的方式與我國不同。他們完全是採取民主的作風，用宣傳方式來爭取民心。</p>
<h3>說文心之巧</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>中國文字，富有神秘性。昔吾鄉許竹實先生，（名景澄謚文肅。）即庚子吾浙三忠之一，（歷任外國公使）當於嘉興會館團拜，（北京郡館，每年團拜一次，惟不演戲耳。）席間，述一故事曰：有善英文者，每自誇能　譯中國文字，然笑柄百出。例如「折衝樽俎之間」，續作「酒杯筷子旁邊，跑馬打仗；」「百鳥鶴鶴。」緒作「兩箇仙鶴，再加一箇白鳥。」且六書以象形會意，　聲為最多數。此外尚有所謂反切者，尚有所謂圈音者，外國文字，決無爾許作用，爾許　　也。但以圈音一項而論，一字圈四角。則平上去入，四音全變，例如唯字，本可與惟字通用，於上角加一圈，即解作答應，音與義及平仄，三項全變矣。</p>
<p>昔有一燈謎，面為佳人唇上點胭脂，謎底為曾子曰唯之唯子，因唯字口上有紅圈也。又有一謎面，為亞字重闌紅一角，謎底為推惡惡之心，推去惡惡之新，只　兩亞字，象重闌也。上亞字有紅圈，象夕陽紅一角也。文心之不可方物，有如此者。</p>

<p>孔雀聲如：都獲。</p>
<p>鴣聲如：行不得也哥哥！鈎輈格礫。</p>
<p>逸春鳥聲如：春去了，春去也！</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>可是這些人倒反不如螞蟻，他們只知道為自己，一些不顧別人。年輕的，壯　的，合着無數身穿制服又像兵又不像兵的人，一齊展開了肉搏一樣的突擊，衝散了所有的老弱婦孺，像狼虎似的翻上車去；車上車下的鐵路職員，倒像隔岸觀火似的退在遠遠的後面，任怎樣也不管。——實際上他們也真管不了！</p>
<p>老祝，老黃，阿李和蘭的堂兄四個男人，以拼命的精神，來護着蘭，緋緋，榮兒，以及六七件行李，在洶湧的人潮中推，擠，挨，頂，支撐，掙扎，苦苦的奮鬥了六七十分鍾，僅僅做到不曾再被氣力更大的人擠翻，也沒有倒退，可是那一列鰐魚似的火車卻還是可望而不可即。</p>
<p>「媽！我怕！我不要上去！」正當大家喘着氣，淌着汗，一籌莫展的時候，抱在蘭手裏的榮兒又帶着哭聲高聲大呌起來。</p>
<p>「別怕，孩子，上了車就好了！」蘭緊皺着眉頭，勉強用極柔和的聲音，安慰她的愛子。</p>
<p>可是人氣的　蒸和人聲的轟鬧，實在使這個五歲的孩子受不住了，他像沒有聽見他母親的話一樣，爽快大哭大吵起來，甚至用力的掙扎，想跳到地下來。</p>
<p>這樣才把其餘四個正以全部精力在拼命向前挨擠的男人也驚動了。老祝首先回頭來向他們看，他的原意也想幫着蘭哄騙小榮，使他寗靜下去；可是他的視綫一確到被擠　在蘭和老黃中間的緋緋的臉龐，心便禁不住狂跳起來。</p>
<p>「緋緋！緋緋！」他急着低下頭去喊。（四七）</p>
<h3>戀愛與禁閉</h3>
<p>— 丁人</p>
<p>報載重慶西鄉黃某，因其子尚就讀於初級中學，年方十七，就開始與某小姐大談戀愛，其父聞訊，不勝震怒，即將此「不可教」的儒子，在家裏禁閉上三年，最近方由親戚幹旋，將其放出。</p>
<p>從這一則新聞上，我領略到了一個嚴重的教育問題，同時也懷疑着我們今天到底還是不是生長在二十世紀的五十年代？</p>
<p>在歐美各國，對男女的社交公開，這是眾所共知的事實，在他們的學校課程中，八九歲的孩子，就開始瞭解花草。昆蟲，到各種小動物怎樣開花結果，怎樣受胎傳種，一直到人類的生孩子，他們都弄得很清楚，決不像中國的家庭，孩子問父母我是那裏來的，父母的回答不是編一套謊言來欺騙，就是把孩子大罵一頓了事。可是，這樣的結果，不僅是造成了孩子對這些問題神秘的幕　，就是逼使孩子去從不正當的地方得到知識，來滿足自己的慾望。</p>
<p>重慶的這位十七歲的靑年，因為談戀愛而坐家庭牢三年，這實在是天大的冤枉。做父親的（或是做教師的）應該　以利害，從生理·學業等多方面去說服他，而不是欺騙。撒謊甚至高壓所能了事。其實，對一件事情的瞭解，是一定要透澈了才能使人心服，否則，任憑你有多大編造謊言的本領，一旦解穿了，是不可收拾的。就拿這位黃君來說，在　三年禁閉而獲釋之後，對某小姐的愛情，就不曾從此中斷，而相反的很可能變本加厲，要是真造成這樣的後果，我相信，這就決不是這位父親之始料所及的吧！</p>
<h3>好險</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>三個　省的教友，某日參加禮拜。牧師講演完畢以後，為了救濟災民，向聽眾捐錢，三個教友緊張異常。最後牧師托着盤子走到了他們的面前，其中一個教友見了便暈厥過去，另外兩人將他扛起身來，走出了教堂。</p>
<h3>觀「歲寒圖」</h3>

<h3>The National Government Appoints Presidents of the Five Yuan; Lists of Government Committee Members from Various Parties Simultaneously Announced; Cabinet Reorganization Can Be Completed in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2:30 AM, 18th] The National Government issued the following orders on the 18th: (1) Appoints Zhang Qun as President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government. This order. (2) Appoints Sun Ke as President of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government. This order. (3) Appoints Ju Zheng as President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government. This order. (4) Appoints Dai Chuanxian as President of the Examination Yuan of the National Government. This order. (5) Appoints Yu Youren as President of the Control Yuan of the National Government. This order. (6) Appoints Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Zhangjia, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Chen Bulei, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, He Luzhi, Wu Xianzai, Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Mo Dehui, Chen Huide, Wang Yunwu, and Bao Erhan as members of the National Government. This order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2:30 AM, 18th] In addition to issuing the appointment orders for the Presidents of the Five Yuan and members of the National Government on the National Government's Capital Nanjing Commemoration Day on the 18th, the National Government has also reportedly issued letters of appointment, additionally appointing Song Qingling, Hu Yisheng, Liu Zhe, Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, Xu Chongzhi, Chen Shuren, Chen Ce, Zhang Fang, Dr. Yao Yue, Diluwa, Xiao Xuan, and Li Genyuan as thirteen advisors to the National Government.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The candidates for Presidents of the Five Yuan remain unchanged, except for Zhang Qun taking the post of President of the Executive Yuan. The candidates for Vice Presidents of the Five Yuan have not yet been proposed. It is widely believed that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be completed in the short term.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The National Government's reorganization, which has been brewing for over a year, to broaden its base, the Kuomintang realizing the end of political tutelage, inviting people from various parties to participate in the government, and preparing to implement constitutional government, has finally been completed. The Republic of China will, from the 18th, step into the world's democratic trend with a new look.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, it has implemented political tutelage, always wanting to return power to the people and achieve constitutional government. However, internal and external troubles have left it with almost no peaceful days. After eight years of the War of Resistance, victory was finally achieved. The National Government then convened the Political Consultative Conference to negotiate with various parties, especially the Communist Party, which held armed forces, sincerely discussing and solving national affairs. However, the Communist Party remained obstinate, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have not been followed, even disregarding the National Government and denying the National Assembly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference and the constitution it formulated, closing the door to peace talks, resulting in the National Government reorganization being unable to invite the CCP to participate. However, the government's original intention has not changed. The significance of the National Government reorganization has finally been realized with the sincere participation of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites.</p>
<p>The new National Government was formed on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the National Government, declaring to the people of the country and the world that our Republic of China has begun to move towards the path of actual governance, and the Kuomintang is working together with various parties for the construction of a democratic political nation, which is an epoch-making event for our country and a symbol of world peace and progress. In the future, the new government will work hard to implement party politics and promote democracy under joint responsibility.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Information Department of the Central Executive Committee held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Lizhi Society at 7:00 PM on the 17th. In addition to announcing the lists of the Vice Chairman of the National Government, members of the National Government Committee, Presidents of the Five Yuan, and members of the Central Political Committee, and the list of government committee members from the Kuomintang (see separate cable), Minister Peng also announced that Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, He Luzhi, and Yu Jiaju were from the Youth Party; Wu Xianzai, Hu Haimen, and Ji Yiqiao were from the Democratic Socialist Party; and Mo Dehui, Chen Huide, Wang Yunwu, and Bao Erhan were social elites. There is still one government committee member from the Democratic Socialist Party to be added, and the full list will be officially announced by the National Government. In response to journalists' inquiries, Minister Peng stated that the reorganized National Government is a government in which various parties participate during the transitional period before the implementation of constitutional rule. However, it is difficult for us to use an appropriate term, as this period is neither a completely tutelage period nor a completely constitutional period. The true beginning of constitutional government must wait until the establishment of the next National Assembly-elected government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Minister of Information Peng Xuepei said that there are still eleven vacant seats on the National Government Committee awaiting representatives from the CCP and the Democratic League. Chairman Chiang is scheduled to hold a press conference for foreign journalists at 10:30 AM on the 18th, which is the Chairman's second reception of foreign journalists since the war, the first being held in Chongqing shortly after the victory.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The list of government committee members has been officially announced. The reorganization of the National Government will be completed on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. Chairman Chiang will issue a brief statement on this in one or two days. The list of all government committee members, including those from the three parties and social elites, was announced by Minister Peng on the evening of the 17th, and all parties have expressed great excitement about this. The date of the oath-taking ceremony for the government committee members is currently unknown, but the Government Committee is scheduled to convene on the 21st.</p>

<h3>Members of the Democratic Socialist Party Advocate Expulsion of Sun Baogang and Others</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1:20 AM, 18th] According to yesterday's report, Sun Baogang, Xu Guangsheng, Wang Shiming, and others from the Democratic Socialist Party held a reception for journalists, opposing the party chairman, Zhang Junmai. According to a statement from the person in charge of the party in Beijing, the steps taken by the chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhang Junmai, to decide to participate in the government have been supported by all party members. Sun Baogang recently participated in the government and has already realized this. Because they were not nominated, they were dissatisfied and used the excuse of demanding full participation, falsely using the name of the majority to undermine party resolutions and slander Zhang Junmai, reversing right and wrong. Now, party members from all over the country are unanimously advocating expelling Sun and others from the party and severely punishing them to maintain party discipline.</p>
<h3>National Government Establishment Anniversary</h3>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses Banking Law and Completes First Reading; Bankers Association Petitions for Temporary Retention of Second Reading</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The full text of the Banking Law draft, consisting of 10 chapters and 119 articles, has been discussed at the 322nd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 17th and has passed the first reading, which can complete the legislative process. The National Government promulgated the Banking Law in the spring of 1931, but it has not yet been implemented. After the end of the War of Resistance, the Legislative Yuan began to整理the Banking Law and has revised its draft seven times. The entire review was completed in mid-month and submitted to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 of the law defines banking business as: (1) Accepting various deposits, (2) Discounting bills, (4) Domestic remittances, (5) Foreign exchange operated under special permit, (6) Acting as an agent for receiving and making payments, (7) Warehousing and custody business, (8) Buying and selling securities and investment, (9) Underwriting or subscribing to public bonds, corporate bonds, and corporate shares, (10) Trading in raw gold and silver and foreign currency under special permit, (11) Managing property in trust. Chapter 2, General Provisions, stipulates that the banks referred to in this law are divided into five categories: (1) Commercial banks, (2) Industrial banks, (3) Savings banks, (4) Trust companies, and (5) Native banks. It also stipulates that each bank shall not engage in business other than the type of business for which it is registered and approved. Violators may be fined up to 10,000 yuan for each responsible person of the bank or ordered to replace its responsible person. If the circumstances are serious, its business license may be revoked. Chapter 3 stipulates the ratio of guarantee reserve funds to be deposited by commercial banks, the scope of business, and the amount of loans. Chapter 4 stipulates the ratio of guarantee reserve funds to be deposited by industrial banks, the scope of business, and the amount of loans. Chapter 5 stipulates the ratio of reserve funds to be deposited by savings banks, the scope of business and savings deposits, the maximum limit per household, and the total amount of loans. Chapter 6 stipulates the scope of business and investment restrictions of trust companies. Chapter 7 stipulates the scope of business and loan restrictions of native banks.</p>
<h3>The Location of Branches Established by Foreign Banks Should Be Restricted</h3>
<p>Chapter 8 stipulates that the areas where foreign banks establish branches in our country should be restricted and stipulates that they shall not engage in the business of concurrently operating savings banks or trust companies. Payments shall also be limited to legal currency, and it is stipulated that deposits shall be used within our country. Chapter 9 stipulates the registration and licensing of banks, and the final Chapter 10 is supplementary provisions.</p>
<p>After the case was presented at the meeting, Zhang Zhaoyuan, the original drafter, first reported the motives for the revision, the principles of legislation, and the difficulties encountered, explaining that the draft still inevitably has some limitations and constraints in guiding and rewarding. After the speech, a discussion on the principles began. Chen Guyuan pointed out that the draft had many points that could be discussed in substance and technically. Currently, it feels difficult to handle, and whether it can be immediately implemented is a big problem. Sun Jiulu also believes that the current economy will be in a state of emergency, the value of the currency is also unstable, and if controls are too loose, it will be enough to affect finance; and the banks also hope not to be too constrained. The Ministry of Finance previously stated that even if the method is passed, it is hoped that the announcement period can be determined by ministerial order. The facts are so, and cannot be ignored. Zhang Zhaoyuan explained separately, pointing out that the capital amount cannot be consistent nationwide, and the draft will divide the country into several regions and separately approve them, so that there will be no impact due to the unstable value of the currency.</p>
<h3>Whether Native Banks Should Be Considered Banks; The Most Intense Disputes During Discussion</h3>
<p>Subsequently, a clause-by-clause discussion was held. The most intense dispute was whether native banks should be classified as banks. It was initially decided to include native banks, but later it was restored. Liu Xianqiao believes that the provisions regarding native banks can be regulated by special laws and regulations and do not need to be included in the Banking Law. Sun Jiulu pointed out that native banks operate commercial banking businesses and can be included in the chapter on commercial banks. Zhang Zhaoyuan disagreed, explaining that banks cannot penetrate rural areas, and native banks have a significant role in various places. In the future, to a considerable extent, they will be changed to banks, and at the same time, their nature will definitely be the same as commercial banks, so it seems appropriate to maintain the original plan. It was resolved that native banks will still be listed as banks referred to in this law, and a special chapter will stipulate their scope of business.</p>
<p>Another issue that caused a lengthy discussion was how to punish banks if they engage in business other than the type of business for which they are registered and approved. Cheng Yuanzhen said that fining each responsible person 1,000 yuan is too much. It is too light to only replace them if the circumstances are serious, and revoking the business license is not enough to make those who disrupt finance tremble. He advocated for severe punishment. Wang Yuxiang and others also believe that the amount of 1,000 yuan is like a drop in the bucket for those who disrupt the market. Zhang Zhaoyuan and others explained that the 1,000 yuan fine is stipulated by the Civil Law, and replacing responsible persons concerns their reputation and cannot be said to be a light punishment. As for revoking the license, its impact on the banking industry is more important than anything else. It was resolved to change 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan and change the clause to replace its responsible person, and if the circumstances are serious, its business license may be revoked.</p>
<p>Jian Guansan pointed out that the interests of depositors should be protected and advocated adding a clause, namely, "In order to protect the interests of depositors, banks should jointly establish a deposit protection organization," which was passed by a majority.</p>
<p>As the discussion was about to end, Wang Yansong, Xu Guowei, Xu Weiming, and Fu Rulin, representatives of the Bankers Association, came to the Legislative Yuan to petition, hoping to postpone the decision. Secretary-General Wu Shangying met with them and reported the progress of the meeting to the Legislative Yuan. All 119 articles of the draft were discussed and passed the first reading, and the second reading procedure was temporarily retained. The meeting did not end until after 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Central Political Committee to Be Established Next Week; Supreme National Defense Council Rushes to Complete Work</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Central Political Committee is scheduled to be established next week. The list of members of the committee has been approved by the Central Standing Committee on the 16th. Standing Committee members of the Central Executive Committee, Standing Committee members of the Central Supervisory Committee, National Government committee members from the Kuomintang, and the Secretary-General of the National Government are all ex officio members of the committee. The existing Supreme National Defense Council is scheduled to rush to complete its work this week, hold its last meeting, and transfer the government-related work to the new National Government Committee, and the party-related work will be transferred to the Central Political Committee.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Political Power Is Consolidated; China Begins to Have Freedom; Vandenberg Asks Congress to Support Truman</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Vandenberg publicly stated in the Senate that he disagreed with the government's policies towards China and Argentina. Regarding China, he believes that there can only be peace when Chairman Chiang consolidates his political power. He went on to warn Congress that if Congress does not support Truman's plan, the United States will have no opportunity to oppose the Communist Party peacefully in the future, which is tantamount to telling the world that aggressors can act recklessly.</p>
<h3>CCP's Jiangsu-Shandong-Anhui Border Provincial Committee Opposes Seizing the World by Armed Force; Criticizes Mao Zedong for Using the People as Cannon Fodder</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] The Jiangsu-Shandong-Anhui Border Area Party Affairs Committee of the Extraordinary Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a declaration on March 1, opposing Mao Zedong's seizing the world by armed force. The content explains that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the people of the country are still living a painful wartime life. Twenty years of armed struggle have led the Communist Party into a dead end. It calls on the entire party and the people of the country to rise up and oppose Mao Zedong's personal self-righteous control of the entire party and the left-leaning erroneous policy of seizing political power by armed struggle, and to oppose Mao Zedong's treating the people as cannon fodder.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Personnel from the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo recently returned for discussions with the General Staff and the State Department regarding the issue of reparations. It is understood that generally, because China fought against Japan for the longest time, it is believed that it can make good use of heavy industrial equipment and transportation facilities, so it is appropriate to be the country that receives the majority of transferred materials. The Allied Headquarters representatives' return to the US for discussions has not changed the opinions of officials regarding the need to make a final resolution proposal. This is because they are aware that other members of the Far Eastern Commission will definitely make requests, but recent discussions have had a definite impact. This has caused some officials to change their opinions regarding what reparations materials can be obtained from Japan and what their value is. The Allied Headquarters representatives will conclude their discussions tomorrow. According to some sources, the Allied Headquarters representatives' return to the US for discussions this time has given officials a clear impression of the Japanese reparations issue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] It was learned today that some representatives of the Allied Headquarters reparations delegation in Washington told the Army Department and the State Department that they believe that after the final analysis, the domestic assets that the victorious Allied nations can remove from Japan for reparations will not exceed the US's provisional plan of 30%.</p>
<p>According to the US's provisional plan of 30%, MacArthur is authorized to propose 15% of Japan's domestic assets available for reparations for distribution to Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. In addition to this, the US has already prepared a final plan, which will be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission. According to this plan, China will be redistributed 30%, and the remaining 10% will be distributed to other member states of the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<p>Officials here have not changed their opinion that it is necessary to complete the overall resolution proposal, because they understand that other member states of the Far Eastern Commission should be allowed to submit their respective requests.</p>
<p>Our Country's Reparations Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss Dismantling and Transportation Plans</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Reparations Committee held a meeting at 3 PM on the 17th. Chairman Gong Xuesui, as well as representatives from the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Resources Commission attended the meeting. The main issues discussed at the meeting were threefold: (1) Dismantling will begin immediately after receiving formal notification; (2) The transportation plan will be handled by a special agency established by the Ministry of Transportation; (3) Funds for operations will be jointly raised by all parties. It is also heard that Gong Xuesui has submitted his resignation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The National Resources Commission of the Executive Yuan has drafted a plan stipulating that China should receive 40% of the total Japanese reparations, focusing on rebuilding China's light industry. Once an agreement is reached between the major powers of the Far Eastern Commission, personnel will be sent to Japan to receive the reparations according to this plan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Industry Plan; Drafted by Experts from Allied Headquarters; Next Year's Exports Will Account for 27% of Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th] According to exclusive news obtained by this agency's Far East Manager, Fang En, the Allied Headquarters textile experts have completed the Japanese textile industry plan. It is estimated that Japan's cotton textile production in 1947 will be approximately 285,000,000 pounds, which accounts for 27% of the pre-war peak of 945,000,000 pounds. The Allied Headquarters textile industry plan aims to ensure that the Japanese textile industry has sufficient spindles after the relocation of Japanese factories. The main points are as follows: (1) To have sufficient products to meet the needs of the Japanese people at the 1930-34 level; (2) To supply a considerable amount for export in the near future.</p>
<p>The Allied spokesman disagreed with the remarks of Huang Yuanbin of China. According to Huang, if the Japanese textile industry is encouraged to a considerable extent, it may, as before the war, serve as a precursor to regaining control of China and other parts of Asia. According to Chinese sources, approximately 3 million spindles in Japanese textile mills have already resumed operation, and another 3 million spindles will begin to be added with MacArthur's support, which is far greater than the currently planned reconstruction plan. However, according to a recent survey, as of February 28th of this year, the number of spindles operating in Japan was approximately 1,041,000. In order to meet Japan's domestic needs and supply the world's shortage of cotton textiles, it is necessary to increase the number of spindles. However, the Allied Headquarters strictly controls all expansion of Japanese industry, so there is no immediate danger of large-scale encroachment on the interests of other textile regions.</p>
<p>Allied authorities expressed surprise at Nanjing's high-pressure competition and talk of destroying the Chinese textile industry. They pointed out that China's 1,400,000 spindles can only supply a very small portion of the country's 450 million people. Since it will take many years for the expansion of China's textile industry to reach the point where it can meet domestic needs, it is reasonable to assume that China needs to accept any foreign supply, regardless of its origin. In this regard, the Chinese side's suggestion to raise tariffs to deal with Japanese textiles is actually a measure that is detrimental to the Chinese people. Officials at Allied Headquarters stated that they are very willing to cooperate with the Chinese government on the plan to rebuild China's textile industry, and are willing to assist the technical problems of the development of that industry by exporting a reasonable number of Japanese textile machines to China. According to them, China should expand its textile industry tenfold in order to supply the needs of the Far Eastern textile market. The Chinese side's suggestion to reduce the number of spindles in the Japanese textile industry to a minimum was countered by the Allied Headquarters' textile officials, who said that Japan's existing spindles have already reached below the minimum limit deemed necessary by Allied Headquarters to maintain Japan's peaceful economy.</p>
<h3>Temporarily Return the Property of Traitors Sentenced to Suspended Sentences</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding whether the seized and sealed property of traitors sentenced to suspended sentences should be unsealed and returned, local courts have many doubts. It has now been learned from the Ministry of Judicial Administration that, for traitor cases that have been definitively sentenced to suspended sentences, the part of the confiscated property that is not necessary for living should be returned unconditionally. The remaining part may be ordered to be kept in custody by the person responsible, and temporarily returned with a guarantee.</p>

<h3>The Yellow River Flood Area is Barren for Thousands of Miles; If Water Conservancy and Irrigation are Not Developed, it Will Become a New Desert; Part of the Inspection Team Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 17th] The Yellow River Flood Area Joint Inspection Team, consisting of more than 50 Chinese and foreign individuals including Huo Shishu, traveled by car from Xuchang to Fugou at 5 a.m. on the 14th. The communist army retreated the night before the inspection team arrived, and the traces of the war were still visible. After the inspection team arrived in Fugou, it immediately investigated the loss situation and the work of the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). At 11 a.m., it left Fugou and continued to advance into the flood area, crossing the Guolu River Cao Guojun警戒 line and delving into the empty area. After the closure of the breach, the Yellow River water had dried up. For more than a hundred miles west of Fugou, there were no signs of human habitation along the way, and the inspection team traveled as if in a sandy desert. At 2 p.m., it arrived at Lian Temple, where the UNRRA tractor team was stationed. The team had 26 new tractors plowing on the sandy ground, and 50,000 mu of land had already been plowed. The inspection team continued to advance westward on the same day and arrived at Xihua County at 3 p.m. There was a UNRRA orphanage in the city, which housed 409 orphans who lived on relief flour. Half of the houses in Xihua were submerged in sand. Yanling Fugou Xihua is only a part of the flood area. From here eastward, adjacent to the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the land is barren for thousands of miles. If water conservancy and irrigation are not developed, it will become a new desert geographically. The inspection team included people from six countries: China, the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and India. They all agreed that the restoration of the flood area has become a major task for China. The inspection team could not stay in danger for a long time, and returned to Xuchang that night, taking a special car north. It arrived in Zhengzhou at 1 a.m. on the 15th, and at 9 a.m. it took a car to Huayuankou to inspect the breach closure project.</p>

<h3>The Tin Grain Industry Requests the Authorities to Allocate Rice for Purchase and Storage</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Wuxi, 17th] Recently, grain prices in the Wuxi area have soared, and merchants from Tianjin, Xuzhou, Chongming, Fuzhou, and other places have come to purchase grain, resulting in a disconnection between supply and demand. The grain industry believes that it is difficult to open up the source of supply and exports cannot be prohibited, so the future of people's food is worrying. Today, it is specially requested that the authorities follow the Shanghai method to allocate the government's rice purchased and stored in Wuxi for sale in succession, in order to enrich the people's food.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Police in Disguise Arrest Rice Merchants Raising Prices</h3>
<p>Twelve Grain Stores Handed Over to the District Court for Trial</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Suzhou County Government took emergency measures because grain prices have been soaring endlessly recently. At 3 p.m. on the 17th, it dispatched all police officers in disguise to various grain stores inside and outside the city to purchase rice with funds to conduct a detailed investigation of black market prices. It did not end until about 8 p.m. The result showed that twelve grain stores were illegally raising prices. One stone of white rice was as high as 180,000 yuan, and even coarse japonica rice required 145,000 yuan. After receiving the report, County Mayor Shen, with conclusive evidence, has decided to transfer the case to the Wudi Court for trial, and issued a statement saying: After this secret investigation, if grain merchants do not repent, this government will spare no effort to investigate grain storage and order the price to be lowered. If the Grain Association still cannot exert the power to report the black market, it is suspected of shielding it, and all directors and supervisors will also be subject to legal punishment.</p>

<h3>Earnestly Implement the Guidelines for Governance!</h3>
<p>——Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the National Government Establishing its Capital in Nanjing——</p>
<p>Today is the 20th anniversary of the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing. Twenty years ago today, the Kuomintang led the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, overthrew the warlords who divided and dominated the country, and established its capital in Nanjing, creating a new situation for national unification. At the same time, the Kuomintang implemented political tutelage, which also began on this day. But today, twenty years later, the National Government is voluntarily reorganizing, recruiting leaders from the Minqing (Democratic Socialist Party) and China Youth parties, as well as social elites, to join the government. At the same time, the guidelines for governance agreed upon by various parties and social elites are also officially announced today. This can be seen not only as the Kuomintang's practice of returning power to the people but also as a significant turning point in Chinese political history. Therefore, today, as we see the domestic political situation becoming clearer, we naturally have a beautiful vision for the future of Chinese politics. However, looking back and looking forward, it is not difficult to prove that China's political progress towards a peaceful and democratic path still requires the redoubled efforts of all parties and factions, as well as the people of the whole country, to make that beautiful vision a reality.</p>
<p>This government reorganization is not merely limited to personnel changes, but its true significance lies in expanding the democratic foundation of the government. Therefore, we believe that this government reorganization is indeed the Kuomintang's practice of returning power to the people. We can say fairly that the Kuomintang's twenty years of political tutelage, due to the double burden of internal and external troubles, failed to achieve the ultimate goal of political tutelage; however, it has made indelible contributions to raising the political awareness of the people and spreading democratic ideas; this is undeniable by anyone. And now the Kuomintang, in the spirit of treating the world as its own, is reorganizing the government, recruiting leaders from various parties and social elites to participate in the government and jointly shoulder the task of preparing for the implementation of constitutionalism. In the history of the development of democratic politics in our country, this is indeed an important turning point.</p>
<p>The initiation of the government reorganization dates back to before the opening of the Political Consultative Conference in January of last year, because at that time, after the victory in the War of Resistance, the whole country unanimously believed that during the transitional period from the victory in the War of Resistance to the beginning of national reconstruction, the Kuomintang should end its political tutelage, and all parties and factions and social elites should jointly shoulder the arduous task of handling military post-war affairs and preparing for constitutionalism. Therefore, the government reorganization plan was also one of the five major resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Later, disputes arose between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and conflicts continued, and it was never realized. It was not until after the close of the National Assembly in December of last year that the call for government reorganization became loud, although the Communist Party and the Democratic League refused to participate, the extension of other party members and social elites to join the government can naturally expand the democratic foundation of the government, thereby breaking the current political deadlock and embarking on a path of peace and democracy. After four or five months of effort, the government reorganization was finally realized today; skeptical people may complain about its slow speed, but its step-by-step progress has already achieved significant results. The first is the participation of the Minqing party and social elites in the government's four institutions (Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, National Political Council, and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association). The second is the passage of ten kinds of laws and regulations related to the implementation of constitutionalism by the Legislative Yuan, which has already completed the procedure for implementing the constitution. Therefore, the government reorganization today can be said to be a natural culmination.</p>
<p>The reorganized National Government, in terms of its nature, is a temporary government that moves from the Kuomintang's end of political tutelage to the constitutional period; in terms of the tasks it undertakes, it is to complete all the necessary preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism as scheduled. The new constitution is scheduled to come into effect on December 25th of this year, only eight months from now. According to the prescribed implementation preparation procedures, it can be divided into two categories: (1) From the date of the promulgation of the constitution, the National Government should quickly amend or abolish existing laws and regulations that conflict with the constitution; (2) After the promulgation of the constitution, the National Government should, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, formulate and promulgate the following laws within three months: (1) Regarding the organization of the National Assembly and the election and recall of representatives of the National Assembly; (2) Regarding the election and recall of the President and Vice President; (3) Regarding the election and recall of legislators; (4) Regarding the organization of the five Yuan. If we take stock of the current situation, we can see that the first type of preparatory work has already been completed. Regarding the second type of work, the reorganized government still needs to actively carry it out. However, the most important work in preparing for the implementation of constitutionalism is not in the legislative preparation procedures, but in the people's understanding of democratic politics. Therefore, during this transitional period, special attention should be paid to the democratic style of politics, so that the people can be influenced by what they see and hear, and a democratic atmosphere can be cultivated. The first general election to be held in the autumn of this year is a major test of whether Chinese politics can be democratized.</p>
<p>During this transitional period, in addition to concentrating all its efforts on preparing for the implementation of constitutionalism, the government cannot neglect domestic affairs, foreign affairs, finance, economy, culture, and education because of the preparation for constitutionalism; therefore, before the government reorganization, the government should adopt which guidelines for governance, and it cannot but be quickly determined through consultation with various parties, as the highest guiding principle that the government should abide by during the transitional period. The Kuomintang representatives and the leaders of the Minqing parties have spent a lot of time and effort discussing this matter. From the beginning of the discussions on the government reorganization to the end of last month, they finally reached an agreement in principle, totaling twelve articles. In principle, provisions have been made on how to solve several important current problems, which can not only be a guideline for all parties to jointly abide by but also can be used to break the current political deadlock. This newspaper has already commented on it on the 25th of last month, and it is expected that the domestic political situation will soon become clear; and pointed out that these twelve key points are the common governance program that the people of the whole country unanimously demand. Now we are even more convinced that the announcement of the reorganized government's guidelines for governance is sufficient to clarify the current domestic political situation so that the people of the whole country will take an optimistic attitude towards the development of the political situation in the future.</p>
<p>But after celebrating the 20th anniversary of the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing with a pleasant mood and welcoming the reorganization of the National Government with the same mood, we still have some opinions to contribute to the leaders of various parties participating in the government.</p>
<p>First, these twelve guidelines for governance are the product of repeated consultations by the leaders of various parties and have been solemnly signed by the leaders of various parties. Although they cannot be regarded as the sacred charter jointly owned, the reorganized government must earnestly implement them. We dare to boldly say that these twelve guidelines are exactly what the people of the whole country expect from the government; if the government implements these guidelines, no matter what difficulties and obstacles it encounters, it will surely gain the support of the people of the whole country and overcome them. Otherwise, the people's joy today will inevitably be in vain again. And we also have to point out that the wording of the guidelines for governance is clear and easy to understand, and it is seen by the people of the country, and no one can distort it. In particular, the leaders who sign on behalf of a party or faction cannot arbitrarily interpret it.</p>
<p>Second, the foundation of the reorganized government has been expanded, and it is no longer a one-party government of the Kuomintang, but a government jointly organized by the Kuomintang and other parties. The foundation of this government is completely built on the sincere unity and concerted cooperation of all factions. Otherwise, it will be difficult to stabilize; therefore, we hope that the leaders of various parties participating in the government can use their political wisdom; for any problem, they can look at it from a distance and think from a broad perspective; put the interests of the country above the parties, and no longer be petty party members, but can be open and aboveboard politicians.</p>
<p>In short, the way out for Chinese politics lies in peace, democracy, unity, and national reconstruction; this government reorganization has already begun to move towards this path; but whether we can achieve our goals depends on whether the reorganized government can be enlightened, impartial, gather talents, and earnestly implement these twelve guidelines for governance!</p>

But when Molotov demanded compensation from German coal mines, the four foreign ministers argued endlessly again. The four foreign ministers discussed 15 of the 59 articles of the Austrian Peace Treaty and reached agreement on 12 of them. Molotov's compensation demand was 12.5% of Germany's total coal production as compensation, and another 12.5% for export. It is said that Marshal Stalin also insisted on a huge amount of compensation when he met with Secretary of State Marshall last night.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the German Issue Is About to End Marshall-Stalin Talks Yielded No Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Moscow, 17th—Radio Moscow: A senior American representative recently declared that unless the Soviet side suddenly makes concessions, the foreign ministers believe that the discussion on the German issue has come to an end. The foreign ministers made this decision because the talks between Marshall and Stalin yielded no results.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] Regarding the rumor that Marshal Stalin's meeting with Secretary of State Marshall has failed, although newspapers here have published it in a prominent position, and semi-official sources also believe it to be true, the White House and the State Department have not issued an official statement on this statement. According to diplomatic sources: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's agreement to sign the Austrian Peace Treaty at this session of the four foreign ministers is a concession that the Soviet Union cannot refuse. Under the current circumstances, Marshal Stalin and Secretary of State Marshall are undoubtedly adhering to their own positions. Diplomatic sources summarized the current situation into three points: (1) The Soviet Union's expression of agreement on the Austrian issue is to save face for the United States; (2) The fate of Germany is still in the hands of the Soviet Union; (3) The purpose of the amendments proposed by Molotov to the four-power convention draft is to make the convention impossible. The Soviet Union is unwilling to sign any clauses in the Treaty of Germany that would allow the United States to maintain its interests in Europe. Semi-official sources believe that the meeting between Marshal and Stalin has caused new factors in US-Soviet relations, which is not absolutely impossible, but the consequences will have to wait and see in the future.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Has Proposed a Governor for the Port of Trieste</h3>

However, it is expected that this action by the Soviet Union will at least enable the five powers to begin discussing this issue. According to regulations, the governor of the Port of Trieste must be appointed by the Security Council, but the five powers hope to first obtain private agreement on the candidate and then submit the appointment to the Security Council.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong to Implement Restrictions on U.S. Imports</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 17th] According to Finance Secretary Stewart, who spoke to a United Press reporter, the import of U.S. goods to Hong Kong, which has always been unrestricted, will soon be subject to a quota system. Before taking this measure, the authorities issued a statement prohibiting black market trading of U.S. dollars to meet the needs of U.S. imports. Stewart admitted that this measure is a partial ban on U.S. imports, because "it is absolutely necessary to preserve Hong Kong's U.S. dollars." But according to U.S. authorities, Hong Kong had $12 million in U.S. dollars two months ago, and only a very small number has been used during this period. The U.S. Consulate here has received complaints from many businessmen and is currently submitting a detailed report to the U.S. State Department.</p>

<h3>The German Fortress on Heligoland to Be Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>(United Press, Heligoland, Germany, 17th) The military installations on Heligoland Island in the North Sea, a point of pride in Hitler's grand plans, will be completely destroyed at 9 PM (Shanghai time) on the 18th. This is the largest man-made explosion since the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests, and also the most extraordinary action by the United Nations to eliminate Germany's war machine. This small island, only one mile long and about half a mile wide, was a sharp sword aimed at the heart of Britain by Kaiser Wilhelm. During World War II, it was used as an important base, capable of accommodating one-man submarines, with a line of 15-inch caliber cannons and radar equipment to detect Allied aircraft bombing Germany. In addition, there was a vast network of tunnels, storing huge amounts of ammunition and secret experimental workshops, hidden underground. The island currently has only ten British residents and one hundred and sixty Germans, and the plan is to destroy it so that it can no longer be used for military purposes.</p>
<p>The island was not only a naval base in the past, but also a scenic tourist destination. It originally had 2,500 residents who lived a relatively prosperous life. Now, all the houses on the island have been destroyed, and no public utilities remain. In the future, apart from fishermen temporarily building houses to stay in, it is unlikely that anyone will settle there permanently.</p>
<p>The island was ceded to Germany by the British in 1890 in exchange for the Zanzibar archipelago in East Africa. Due to its strategic location, it threatened Britain in both World Wars. During World War II, the island's military equipment included three 30.5 cm naval guns, three 10.5 cm anti-aircraft guns, two large howitzers, and a radar station. In the center of the island, there are the remains of a British four-engine bomber, and British and American pilots are buried in the island's church.</p>
<p>After a major British air raid on April 5, 1945, the residents evacuated to the mainland. Their private property, about 40,000 tons, was also transported to the mainland after the war. Other movable and useful items have been taken away by fishermen. The British flag is still flying on the island. The tunnels are as dense as a honeycomb, with entrances under the cliffs, winding and twisting inwards. Experts estimate that the ammunition buried inside is no less than 6,500 tons, of which 3,400 tons are explosives, and all will be destroyed together. The fuse is several miles long, connected to underwater cables, extending to a buoy nine miles away.</p>
<p>According to experts, the force of the explosion will penetrate 100 li underground, and scientists hope to use this to discover some secrets of the Earth's crust in Europe. Seismological observatories in London, Moscow, and Rome have been notified to pay attention to the Earth's vibrations during tomorrow's explosion. According to a British naval officer, the purpose of the explosion is not to completely destroy the island, but after the tunnels collapse, the island's height will be reduced, and the cliffs will also collapse. When the main tunnels are destroyed, one end of the island may split. After the explosion, they will wait about two days for the smoke to dissipate before entering the port for inspection.</p>
<h3>Seventy-Five Gasoline Tanks Ablaze, Texas City Fire, City Engulfed in Flames, Eight Hundred Dead</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The American Red Cross estimates that the death toll in the Texas City explosion disaster has reached as many as eight hundred people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] Today in Texas City, a fire on a ship carrying ammonium nitrate caused explosions in chemical plants and oil tanks. A mushroom-shaped cloud, like after an atomic bomb, rose straight into the sky. The entire city was filled with toxic gas. The number of dead is between five hundred and one thousand, and the number of injured is between two thousand and eight thousand. This is an unprecedented tragedy in American history. All the oil tanks in the city are on fire, making it impossible for rescue teams to enter. All the houses are trapped in the sea of fire. Several hours after the explosion, the streets were still crowded with thousands of dazed residents. Many houses and tall buildings in the city were razed to the ground. Because the city's external telephone lines are completely cut off, accurate information is still lacking. Based on various reports, the situation can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Catches Fire, Followed by Explosion</p>
<p>This morning, the 7,176-ton Liberty ship "Grandcamp," carrying ammonium nitrate fertilizer, arrived in Texas City. After reaching the dock, a fire suddenly broke out on board for unknown reasons. Efforts to extinguish it were unsuccessful, so it was towed into the river in an attempt to continue firefighting. Unexpectedly, an explosion occurred, affecting the Monsanto Chemical Plant on the riverbank. The plant also exploded, with copper and iron beams being blown up to fifteen miles away. The entire plant was destroyed. In Galveston, twenty kilometers away, many glass windows and ceilings were shattered. Residents at the time thought it was an earthquake and ran out into the streets to escape. Telephone communication between New York and Texas City and nearby cities was still unavailable by 6 PM. According to a Coast Guard report, the buildings along the dock have all collapsed. The most solid stone buildings in the center of Texas City were also razed to the ground.</p>
<p>Watching the Fire from Across the River, Tragically Buried Alive</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Texas City, 17th] After the explosions in this city all day yesterday, 15,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate to prevent the danger of toxic gas. Seventy-five gasoline tanks were on fire at the same time, plus other fires, causing the entire city to be thickly enveloped in smoke. A curfew was declared in the city last night, and troops patrolled the ruined city to prevent looting. The first explosion on the "Grandcamp" was at 9:20 AM, followed by a series of explosions. At the time, firefighters bravely fought the fire, and many people watched the fire from the shore. Suddenly, an explosion occurred, burying all the fire watchers alive. Piles of bodies were stacked together, with as many as seventy-five bodies in some piles. The cargo ship "Grandcamp" has been blown to pieces.</p>
<p>Fire Approaching, Explosives Warehouse</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] According to the latest report from Galveston, the fire in Texas City is approaching a warehouse storing explosives on the dock. Therefore, the police have ordered all rescue personnel to stop rescue work and evacuate immediately.</p>
<p>[United Press, Texas City, 17th] Two more explosions occurred here today. The flames spread, gradually approaching an armory, a poison gas plant, and another cargo ship full of nitroglycerin. Residents are fleeing in droves.</p>
<p>[United Press, Texas City, Texas, 17th] Following yesterday's shocking explosion of the French cargo ship "Grandcamp," another cargo ship "High Flyer," loaded with ammonium nitrate, exploded in the harbor at 2 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Four Jewish Terrorists Hanged, Situation in the Holy Land Suddenly Tense, Irgun Gang Vows Revenge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 16th] After the execution of four Jewish terrorists, the situation in the Holy Land has become tense again. British troops have doubled and tripled their alert today. After the curfew was issued, 500,000 Jews were virtually confined to their homes to prevent further riots.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] The secret radio station of the Jewish terrorist group Irgun declared today that it would hang forty British soldiers in retaliation for the execution of Gruner and the other three.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] The War Office received a threatening phone call this afternoon, saying that a certain group would blow up the War Office building at 4 PM.

Earlier this morning, a homemade time bomb was found in the women's restroom of the Colonial Office in Dover House. A Colonial Office spokesperson said that this was the work of Jewish terrorists. It is noted that during the tense situation in Palestine last year, many buildings also received threatening phone calls.</p>
<h3>US Social Work Conference Opens, Discusses New Methods of Assisting China, Advocates Adopting a Clearer Relief Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] The US Social Work Conference opened here today. Many members called on the United States to provide China with new types of assistance, suggesting raising the Chinese immigrant quota and adopting a clearer relief policy. Mrs. Leach, Director of the Immigrant Protection League of Chicago, called for the enactment of new laws to make it easier for foreigners to be naturalized as US citizens. It is said that the only way to help Chinese people naturalize is to increase their immigration quota. If the United States had treated China fairly and without discrimination in 1924, the identities of 2,415 Chinese immigrants would have been confirmed in the past 23 years, and they would have become US citizens long ago. The United States should correct past mistakes and at least give Chinese people this opportunity without further delay. Howard, former Deputy Director of the UNRRA China Office, expressed pessimism about China's relief problems. It is said that if the United States attempts to help China, it must change its social assistance institutions and foreign policy. China's economic standards should be completely changed, its tax collection institutions should be reformed, and its military spending should be reduced. China is a poor country even by its own standards, so it should be allowed to find ways to save itself and decide what kind of foreign aid it needs. It is our duty to help China, but we must do so with humility and share weal and woe with them, not just give alms.</p>
<h3>United Nations Investigates Conditions in Trust Territories</h3>

<h3>United Nations Special Session to Convene on the 28th of this Month</h3>
<p>Conflicts between Jewish and Arab Representatives Likely</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie told the press today that he does not intend to formally invite President Truman to preside over the opening ceremony of the United Nations General Assembly special session to discuss the Palestine issue. The General Assembly will be presided over by Belgian representative Langehove, and there will be no formal opening ceremony. As of now, 35 countries have replied to the United Nations agency agreeing to convene this special session, with the last four countries being Turkey, Poland, Bolivia, and Uruguay. No country has yet requested that other issues be included in the agenda of the General Assembly. However, the General Assembly may elect two members of the Trusteeship Council. The permanent site of the United Nations agency, the first batch of new buildings, may be completed in 1949.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations special session is scheduled to convene on the 28th of this month to discuss the Palestine issue. Both Jews and Arabs are planning strategies, and major conflicts are expected to occur at that time. A spokesman for the Jewish Agency said that the Agency would formally request permission for Jewish representatives to participate in the discussion and immediately open Palestine to Jewish immigration. Arab spokesmen said that both proposals would be met with strong opposition. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie said that the General Assembly itself must decide the scope of the discussion, and he hopes that all representatives will not be constrained by formalities so that the discussion can proceed quickly.</p>
<h3>Philippines and Japan Resume Trade, Preliminary Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 16th] Presidential Secretary Abello announced today that the Philippines and Japan have reached a preliminary agreement through MacArthur Headquarters, and both sides can resume trade.

<h3>Britain Actively Prepares to Participate in the Peace Conference with Japan</h3>
<p>Currently Exchanging Opinions with the Dominions</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Regarding MacArthur's proposal that the US government convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, Britain and the Dominions are currently exchanging opinions on this matter. It is reported that Britain has also provided guarantees to Australia and New Zealand's request to be major participants in the peace conference with Japan, backing them up. According to political figures here, the US State Department will likely accept MacArthur's proposal. The first task for Secretary of State Marshall after returning to Washington from Moscow will be to consider convening a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible. Considering that the US government previously ordered MacArthur to allocate 30% of Japan's war industry to China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines as reparations, but did not mention the requirements of Australia and New Zealand, it is imperative that Britain exchange opinions with its Dominions.</p>

<h3>Sugar Merchants Speculating, Authorities Investigating Thoroughly</h3>
<p>Recently, with the resurgence of price inflation, the market price of sugar has also exceeded the negotiated price. The reporter visited Director Wu of the Social Bureau yesterday to inquire about this matter. Director Wu stated that the price of sugar has been jointly negotiated several times since September last year, and Taiwan Sugar Corporation has distributed sugar on a regular basis. The quantity is sufficient, and there is no problem with the supply. The recent rise in sugar prices is obviously caused by general speculative hoarders, and personnel are being sent to conduct a thorough investigation. In order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to hoard and to benefit the people, the Bureau has proposed to restore the household sugar rationing method at the first price evaluation meeting. The committee has passed the proposal, and all procedures are being expedited. After the resumption of household sugar at par, the general public will have a place to obtain sugar, and they will not need to search for it on the black market. In addition, the sugar distributed by Taiwan Sugar Corporation on a regular basis has been temporarily suspended due to the ongoing household sugar rationing. The company has been requested to temporarily suspend the distribution to avoid the sugar from flowing into the black market and fueling speculation.</p>

<h3>No Merchant Ships in Reparations, Shipping Industry Expresses Surprise, Private Ship Compensation Committee Urges Authorities to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a statement made by Zhong Shandao, the person in charge of the Private Ship Compensation Committee, there are no merchant ships included in the Japanese reparations. The Chinese shipping industry is very surprised and intends to propose to the government that it urge the Far Eastern Reparations Commission to pay attention. Furthermore, the Chinese shipping industry expresses its firm opposition to MacArthur's policy. Since Japan is a country that built its foundation on the ocean, its maritime power must be restricted, regardless of future international situations in the Far East. Furthermore, given that China's future national fortune is greatly dependent on the development of maritime power, it is imperative to strive resolutely. Currently, Japan has more than 1.5 million tons of remaining warships. The scale of Japan's shipbuilding heavy industry, preserved under MacArthur's protective policies, is very large. Its shipbuilding capacity could once again make it a first-class maritime power in the world within ten years. Therefore, all levels of the Chinese government and people must fully pay attention to the consequences arising from MacArthur's policy.</p>
<p>In addition: The committee will soon publish a written statement to attract the attention of the authorities and the US government, and will send telegrams to both houses of the US Congress to appeal. Mr. Zhou plans to travel to Nanjing next week to make recommendations to relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Delegates to Nanjing to Discuss Reparations Transport</h3>

(3) The basis for calculating the wholesale price is the sum of the original allocated price, transportation costs, depreciation, and legitimate profits. The basis for calculating the retail price is the sum of the wholesale price, transportation costs, depreciation, and legitimate profits. The amounts of each item will be filled in by the respective trade associations and submitted to the Fuel Group of the Evaluation Committee for investigation and approval.

<h3>Southern Goods Merchant Song Zhuozai Suspected of Being a Traitor, Initial Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case against Song Zhuozai, who runs a business selling southern goods, on suspicion of being a traitor, was heard for the first time in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Song is accused of serving as a member of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association during the enemy and puppet period. When puppet government chairman Chen Gongbo, puppet Shanghai mayor Zhou Fohai, and puppet chief economic advisor Japanese national Ogura Masatsune, and others came to Shanghai, the defendant was listed as one of the participants in welcoming them. The accuser presented photographic evidence of the news published in the "Xinwen Bao" at that time. He is also accused of soliciting donations for airplanes and contributions of copper and iron, and of being sworn brothers with Xue Youwen, the puppet special higher section chief who has already been sentenced to life imprisonment. Presiding Judge Liu questioned him about each of the charges. The defendant simply replied "No" or "I don't know." Regarding the reason for the accusation by the accuser Wang Zhenzhong, he claimed, "Wang is a second landlord who assigned the house at No. 40 Zhejiang Road to the defendant in the 31st year [of the Republic], and a contract was established. Recently, the Wang family has gone back on their word and intends to take it back, but the defendant did not agree, leading to resentment." Regarding the relationship with Xue Youwen, he claimed they only knew each other and denied being sworn brothers. Xue Youwen was then brought in to testify. Xue said: "Song's southern goods store was located in Dongxinqiao. I served as the deputy detective in the Lao Zha police station. Dongxinqiao was within the jurisdiction of the Lao Zha police station. Once, the store reported a theft, and that's how we met. We can't even be called friends." Afterwards, defense attorney Gui Yu presented the house assignment contract signed by Wang and Song in the 31st year, to prove the accuser's motives. He also presented the New China Manual to prove that the defendant's name was not included on the list of puppet Municipal Welfare Association members. Finally, Presiding Judge Liu declared: "This case still needs further investigation. The defendant is entrusted to the defense attorney, and in addition to the original guarantor, another reputable shop must be added as guarantor."</p>
<h3>Monthly Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association</h3>

<h3>China Should Be an Invited Country to the Peace Conference with Germany Based on the Potsdam Agreement, Wang Zhuyi Expresses His Opinion</h3>
<p>After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference that China should be an invited country to the Peace Conference with Germany, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang issued a solemn statement the other day. A reporter visited Wang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Branch of the National Diplomatic Association, to ask about this issue, which has attracted much attention from all parties. Wang Zhuyi expressed the following opinion: Whether from any angle, China is no less qualified than the Soviet Union to be an invited country to the Peace Conference. China was the first country to oppose aggression and declare war on Germany. Because of its full-scale war against Japan, it was unable to travel across the ocean to participate in military actions against Germany. Because it did not participate in military actions against Germany, it did not participate in the signing of the German surrender. However, from the overall perspective of the war situation, China consistently restrained Japan on the Far Eastern battlefield, making Japan unable to assist Germany, attack the Soviet Union, accelerate Germany's collapse, and end the entire world war ahead of schedule. Today, China is only demanding the strict implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and is not making any demands beyond this agreement. The Potsdam Agreement is the basic agreement for dealing with aggressors and rebuilding peace, and no country should be allowed to undermine it. We cherish the friendship of the Soviet Union and look forward to the Soviet Union changing its attitude, working together for international cooperation based on the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, to lay the foundation for the permanent peace of the future world.</p>
<h3>Academic Lecture by the Asian Literary Society, Jiang Tingfu Discusses China's Lifeline</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Former Executive Director Jiang Tingfu was invited by the Shanghai Shangxian Hall (International Institute of China) yesterday to give a lecture on "China's Lifeline" at the Asian Literary Society, No. 20, Museum Road, at 5:30 PM. Shangxian Hall is an academic organization of international figures in this city with a history of more than 40 years. It is now cooperating with the Asian Literary Society to regularly hold lectures by famous people. The following is a summary of Mr. Jiang's speech yesterday: "Since the end of World War II, the development of international relations has been quite disappointing, and everyone hopes to improve it. Originally, international politics can be divided into two types: one is power politics, and the other is ideal politics. It is undeniable that the existence of power politics in the international arena today is an important fact. What power politics strives for is strategic areas and materials needed for strategic purposes. However, people cannot live without bread, nor can they live solely on bread. Humans have ideals and principles. Fighting for ideals and principles is more important than strategic struggles.</p>
<p>China's lifeline is not in ports, islands, coastlines, or the competition for materials. China's lifeline lies in being able to freely develop a social and economic system based on the will and circumstances of the Chinese people, without external interference.</p>
<p>The current world situation is a confrontation between the two major forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. Both sides believe in the perfection of their own systems and hold the prejudice of "either me or you." However, from an individual perspective, social and economic systems are highly adaptable. The system that China should develop is neither American nor Soviet. China cannot adopt the American-style private capital system because of the Chinese people's traditional concepts and lack of interest in the private capital system. Some industries, such as railways, munitions, and oil refining, must currently be operated by the government. In the future, as modern technology develops, industries such as water conservancy and electricity will also be more advantageous for the government to operate. Chinese historical traditions do not oppose the government doing more. As for the issue of efficiency, it can be gradually improved. On the other hand, China cannot be like the Soviet Union, where the national economy is completely controlled by the government. Because the Chinese people have a stronger individualistic color, and the traditional system of private land ownership has a history of thousands of years, the Soviet-style collective farms are impossible to implement in China. Moreover, the advantage of the collective system lies in the large-scale use of machinery, which is not the case in China. Because China's main crop is rice, and rice cultivation is more difficult to mechanize.</p>
<p>Therefore, China's social and economic system is one in which government enterprises and private enterprises coexist. Their proportions may vary from time to time, but it is believed that they will not follow the American or Soviet model. If the social and economic systems of countries around the world can have more variations other than the United States and the Soviet Union, then this world may be more sound."</p>

<h3>Rebuilding Hengfeng Bridge Requires 2 Billion</h3>
<p>Public Works Bureau Hosted Reporters for a Tour Yesterday</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works Bureau hosted reporters from this city at 2:00 PM yesterday for a tour of the Hengfeng Bridge reconstruction project. At the original site of the bridge, there was previously a wooden bridge, commonly known as the Shanbanchang New Bridge. It connects the North Second Road of Zhongzheng in the south and Hengfeng Road in the north. The North Railway Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Zhabei area all use the bridge, which is extremely convenient. During the period of the occupation, it was dismantled by the enemy and puppets, causing the north-south transportation artery to be interrupted. All transportation vehicles had to change routes through the bridges in the lower reaches of the Suzhou River, and the traffic between the North Railway Station and the western part of Shanghai had to detour through the central area, which caused traffic congestion in the central area. The situation became severe and urgently needed to be resolved. In view of this, the Public Works Bureau proposed the reconstruction of the Hengfeng Road Bridge. In January of last year, the Municipal Council passed a resolution to actively plan it, and construction began in February of this year.</p>
<h3>Using Reinforced Concrete</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has been planning the design since June of the 35th year [of the Republic], and the drawings and budget were completed in October of the same year. The design principle is that the geology of Shanghai is soft, and the bridge seats of various bridges in the lower reaches of the Suzhou River often sink, making it difficult to remedy. Although the building structures such as the linked beam and the cantilever beam save materials and increase the span, it is also difficult to save them after the bridge seat is found to be sinking. After weighing the pros and cons, it was decided to use a five-hole single-beam bridge seat made of reinforced concrete and a movable steel bearing plate at the bottom of the bridge seat. If the bridge seat or abutment sinks, the steel bearing plate can be stretched and moved at any time, so that the bridge itself will not be affected in any way.</p>
<h3>Over 600 Million Yuan Has Been Paid</h3>
<p>After the design of the project was completed, it was entrusted to the China Bridge Company. Construction of the bridge began on February 20th of this year. To date, a total of more than 600 million yuan of public funds have been spent, of which more than 470 million yuan has been used for the purchase of materials, accounting for 77%, and the labor part accounting for 23%. The main part of the cement has been requested to be allocated from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and most of the wood has been ordered from the Central Trust Company. Other materials have also been purchased through price comparison.</p>
<p>The budget for the bridge, calculated in October of the 35th year [of the Republic], was more than 800 million yuan in national currency. However, with the recent soaring prices of materials, it is estimated that the project will require a total of more than 2 billion yuan. A supplementary budget is currently being prepared and submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Cultural Catastrophe, Antiquities Flowing Overseas, Antique Dealers Collecting Everywhere and Smuggling Them Out of the Country to Exchange for Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, several large antique dealers are currently collecting historical relics from all over China in places such as Beijing and Shanghai, and transporting them to the United States for sale in exchange for US dollar foreign exchange. It is heard that a hundred or so boxes of extremely valuable calligraphy and paintings, stone carvings, ancient bronzes, pottery, ancient porcelain, pottery figurines, etc., were secretly smuggled out of Shanghai two or three days ago. According to regulations, the customs has long banned the export of antiquities. Therefore, they are extremely secretive before shipment and use various relationships to smuggle them out. Furthermore, it is known that many of the Qing imperial family's old collection of antiquities were gradually shipped out under the name of being awarded to Pujie (Puyi's younger brother). Among them, ancient paintings are the most valuable. They were almost completely lost in the puppet palace in Changchun during the victory, and have recently been discovered in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. After hearing the news, the Ancient Palace Museum spent huge sums of money to recover several pieces, but many are still scattered abroad. It is also heard that many have fallen into the hands of antique dealers and will also be shipped to the United States for sale. Currently, people in this city who care about cultural relics have contacted the Antiquities Preservation Committee and the customs to find ways to prevent this, so as to prevent important cultural relics of our country from falling into foreign lands. According to a cultural relics and archaeology expert, a reporter was told that there are a large number of extremely important and valuable cultural relics in our country that are scattered abroad. For example, the best Zhan bronzes are in the United States, and the best Han bricks are in Canada. In addition to those flowing into Japan, a large number of famous paintings are in the United States. London, Paris, Sweden and other places also have a large number of extremely valuable antiquities from our country in their collections. During the War of Resistance against Japan, because of inconvenient transportation, there was less outflow of cultural relics than there is now. After the victory, overseas transportation was smooth, and unscrupulous antique dealers secretly and massively transported antiquities out of the country. This is a very large loss to our country. It is hoped that the government will quickly pay attention to this and strictly crack down on it, so as to preserve the only remaining part of our national quintessence.</p>

<h3>Two Thieves Who Stole Yang Pine Logs Are Caught</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A barren field of the Yangshupu Power Plant in eastern Shanghai had a Yang pine log with a diameter of 24 inches, estimated to be worth 3-4 million yuan. Unexpectedly, it was stolen on the evening of the 6th. The owner, Zixingji Transportation Firm No. 512, 33 Sichuan Middle Road, reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which ordered all branches to pay close attention. It was later discovered by the Water Police Bureau that Ding Guigen, a suspected receiver of stolen goods, was planning to sell it, and he was detained for questioning. According to his confession, the theft was committed by Sun Wengui and Hua Xiaohu. The police were then ordered to go to the thatched shed at No. 7 Beihuajing Road to arrest Sun Wengui, and to No. 6 Sanrong West Road, Lao Sanjing, Pudong to arrest Hua Xiaohu. Both confessed to the theft after being brought to the bureau for questioning, and will be sent to the judicial authorities for trial soon.</p>
<h3>A Truck Loaded with Iron Materials Was Found to Be Suspected of Receiving Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At about 5:00 AM on the 12th, Yang Yonggen, the squadron leader of the Yijing Brigade in the Xinshijie area, led Yijing police to search pedestrians in the Ganggong Road area. Suddenly, a 35569 truck was seen loaded with 46 tap water pipes and 20 bundles of triangular iron, totaling 60 pieces. The situation was very suspicious. When questioned, the escort Xu Chenglong stammered, so the driver Wang Alin, the helper Qian Youliang, and Xu were taken to the Xinshijie Police Station for interrogation. As Xu and others were suspected of receiving stolen goods, they were sent to the Garrison Command yesterday for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Dispute, Both Parties Have Different Views</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the case of the sugar dispute at Xintaichang Firm, Prosecutor Liang Gengsheng of the District Prosecutor's Office summoned both parties for interrogation yesterday. Zhou Qibai (female) arrived at the court in a black-market private car at around 3:00 PM, dressed in a flamboyant manner. According to her, the original owner of the batch of Taiwanese sugar was named Xu Chuyuan, who later transferred and sold it several times. She purchased it from Zheng Dangquan in October of last year and holds proof. However, Huang Xianzhang claimed that the batch of Taiwanese sugar actually belonged to him and was stored in the Tongfeng Firm. Because he planned to export the sugar, he entrusted Zhou Qibai to handle the procedures and find a way to transport it out. All the evidence therefore fell into Zhou's hands. Zhou intentionally embezzled the sugar, moved it to Xintaichang, and presented witnesses Gu Qilu, Zhang Baorong, and Bi Jinjun. All three witnesses were able to clearly state the above facts. Prosecutor Liang determined that both parties had different views and that evidence needed to be investigated before it could be determined whether Zhou Qibai had engaged in fraudulent and deceptive behavior, and ordered a new hearing to be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Male Body Found Bound and with Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 11:00 AM on the 16th, a male body was found in the Huangpu River in the North Ticket Terminal waters by the Huangpu South District Station of the Water Police Bureau.

<h3>Notorious Gang Leader from Tianshenggang Arrested in Shanghai While Seeking Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Chen Youqing, a notorious gangster from Haimen, has been leading gangs in the Tianshenggang area of Nantong, committing numerous major robberies. In mid-August of last year, Ni Hanchun, the captain of the Criminal Police Team of the Chongming County Police Bureau, was riding a public bus in Tianshenggang with his officers when several of Chen's henchmen, armed with guns, suddenly boarded the bus and robbed all the passengers of their belongings. Even the official firearms of Ni and his men were taken. A month ago, Chen sent someone to contact Ni, promising to return the firearms and compensate for everything. Ni ignored the offer. It was recently discovered that Chen was the head of the People's Self-Defense Corps in Haimen, using the alias Tang Weishi. He recently went to Pudong to sell machine guns, but accidentally misfired, injuring his abdomen. He was accompanied to Shanghai for treatment at the China-America Hospital. Ni then prepared an official document and came to Shanghai to request the assistance of the Xincheng Police Branch. Zhuo, the branch director, ordered Section Chief Ding and officers Fang Shengwu and Gu Zhuobin to accompany Captain Ni to the China-America Hospital. They successfully arrested the main culprit, Chen Youqing, along with suspected accomplices Niu Chaozuo, Ni Wangnan, Chen Zhijiang (Chen Youqing's father), and a young woman, Xu Ding, who were taking care of him in the ward. All were taken to the police station for questioning, where they all denied involvement. However, it has been learned that several of Chen's accomplices, including Yang Hesheng, Lu Yun, and Xiaoyu Jinniang, have been frequenting Shanghai, staying at places like the Guanshi Da Shanghai Hotel and the Anshang Hostel on Yunnan Road. Police were dispatched to search for them, but they had all returned to the countryside. Chen and the other five suspects are to be handed over to Captain Ni to be taken back to Chongming County for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Dancer Accuses Bank Manager of Violence Over Items Demanded at Cinema, Biting Her Teeth and Calling Him 'Heartless'</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Mingxia, a dancer from the Yangzi Dance Hall ten years ago, accused Gao Bokang, an assistant manager at Zhejiang Jianye Bank, of assault. The case was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate and was heard yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Mei Erhe. According to the defendant, Gao Bokang, Zhang Mingxia was a prostitute ten years ago, and was eighteen years old at the time. He redeemed her with two hundred gold pieces and sent her to Yangzi as a dancer. However, Zhang was too tall, and her dancing business was slow. When he occasionally went to support her, Zhang would complain and beg to marry him so that she could rely on him for the rest of her life. Thus, they once lived together, but they had long since separated. Zhang Mingxia claimed that she is now twenty-eight years old and had once lived with Gao. On March 13th of this year, she met Gao Bokang at the Shanghai Guangda Theater. Remembering that he had taken a watch and one tael of gold from her in the past, she demanded them back. The defendant not only refused to return them but also assaulted her, injuring her head. She requested that he be severely punished. The court scheduled sentencing for the 24th. When the two left the courtroom, Zhang Mingxia gritted her teeth and said to Gao, "Gao Bokang, you are so heartless. I will make you pay!" Gao did not answer and left with a smile.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Clarification</h3>
<p>Stolen Tombstones</p>
<p>Li Mingfeng asks: My late father's tomb has a tomb path made of stone. In May of the 33rd year of the Republic, I discovered that it had been stolen and sold. However, the local situation was complicated at the time, and I was unable to stop it. After investigation, it was found that my elder brother was responsible. I declared the property rights in the newspaper in April of the 33rd year of the Republic, and at the same time hired workers to retrieve the original items. The buyer did not interfere. However, in January of the following year, the buyer secretly removed the stone materials again. Recently, I hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in court accusing the buyer of damaging the tomb (Article 353 of the Criminal Law). However, the court believes that my elder brother sold the materials and that the civil lawsuit must be resolved before the case can be accepted. I have now withdrawn the case temporarily according to the court's instructions. I would like to ask: (1) Can tombstone building materials be bought and sold? (2) Can jointly owned property be disposed of individually? (3) Does my prior declaration of property rights in the newspaper have legal effect? (4) The sales contract is not in my late father's handwriting, and the intermediary also did not sign. It seems to have been written by the buyer. Is it valid? (5) How should the civil lawsuit be handled to be effective? (6) Can I file a public prosecution by directly reporting to the Prosecutor's Office? (7) If the buyer A resells to B, who resells to C, and C has built a tomb, is C jointly liable? (8) Does the delay in filing a lawsuit until now due to the enemy-occupied period mean that the statute of limitations has expired? (9) I have no physical evidence. The defendant's physical evidence consists only of two unwritten sales contracts. Is it possible to demolish someone else's tomb? (10) Can witness testimony be used as a basis?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) It cannot be used to oppose a "bona fide third party who is unaware of the situation." (4) A sales contract does not require handwritten form to be valid, so the sales contract is still valid even if it is not in the seller's handwriting. (5) According to the provisions on co-ownership in the Civil Code's Book of Property Rights, the co-owner should request the court to confirm that the sales contract is invalid, and then request the buyer to return the co-owned property. (6) No, because the same case has already been filed as a private prosecution and withdrawn, it cannot be filed as a public prosecution with the Prosecutor's Office again. (7) Not liable, because joint liability is limited to cases where it is explicitly and voluntarily assumed, or where it is stipulated by law. (8) The statute of limitations has not expired. (9) It depends on who owns the property. Within the scope of legal restrictions, the owner can freely dispose of their property, that is, they can demolish their own tomb. (10) It can be used as a method of proof.</p>

<h3>Salary Grades for Teachers in Schools in Jiangxi Province Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanchang] The salary grades and annual increment methods for principals and teachers in provincial secondary and higher schools in Jiangxi Province have been approved by the provincial government. It is understood that the salaries paid to principals and teachers in various secondary and higher schools in Jiangxi Province have in fact exceeded the standards set by the Ministry. For example, graduates of domestic universities can only be ranked at the fifth or fourth level of assigned posts at most, but in reality, most start at the third level of assigned posts. In another case, graduates of domestic and foreign universities with specialized publications that have passed review can be ranked from the twelfth or tenth level of recommended posts up to the fifth level of selected posts. However, teachers in specialized schools with qualifications equivalent to civil officials are ranked from the fifth level of recommended posts up to the third level of selected posts, which is much more lenient than the ranking of civil officials. Therefore, it is difficult to adequately meet the needs with the civil servant salary ranking method. However, it is heard that the salaries of teachers and staff in other provinces are actually higher than those in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<h3>Key Focus of Secondary Education in Shanghai: Expanding Vocational Education, Qibao Agricultural School to Open this Autumn</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The key focus of the Municipal Education Bureau's work in secondary education for the 36th year of the Republic is to expand vocational education. It has been decided to add six schools: (1) Senior Midwifery School, (2) Senior Nursing School, (3) Shipbuilding Vocational School, (4) Fisheries Vocational School, (5) Agricultural Vocational School, (6) Secondary Business School. The Midwifery and Nursing Schools have already started classes in cooperation with the Health Bureau, but due to late enrollment, only one class has been recruited at each school. In the autumn, two classes can be recruited at each school. The preparation of the Shipbuilding Vocational School has been discussed with the Jiangnan Shipyard, which has agreed to assist, but there is no school building, so it cannot be established. Only a shipbuilding department can be attached to the Municipal Industrial College first, which has also started classes. The preparation of the Fisheries Vocational School has received support from the Fish Market authorities. They will soon convene all fish merchants to raise funds to build a school building on Fuxing Island. The Agricultural School will be established in Gaohang in the 7th and 2nd districts respectively. Local people in Qibao have donated more than one hundred mu of land as an experimental field, and nearby temples will be used as school buildings. It can open in the autumn.

<h3>Teacher Training College in Fujian Province on Strike, Demanding to be Upgraded to Teacher's College; States that it will not Rest Until its Goal is Achieved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Fuzhou, 17th] Students at the Fujian Provincial Teacher Training College went on strike yesterday because their request to be upgraded to a teacher's college was not granted. According to the student union: When Chairman Liu visited the school last year, he promised to upgrade it within a year, and he should fulfill his promise now. Taiwan and Anhui provinces already have provincially run normal colleges, and Fujian province should follow suit. Furthermore, the Teacher Training College has been running for six years and is roughly of scale, so upgrading it would not increase the government's burden too much. If this legitimate request is not approved by the government, they will not resume classes, and they hope that all sectors will show sympathy.</p>

<h3>Soaring Yarn Prices and Cotton Shortages: Private Yarn Factories Face Difficulties; All Private Yarn Factory Committee Members of the Textile Control Committee Resign</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and the other four private yarn factory committee members of the Textile Control Committee recently submitted their resignations due to the repeated soaring of yarn prices, cotton shortages in various factories, and unprecedented difficulties in resuming production. As Wang and the others are also standing directors of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District and serve as members of the Textile Control Committee, they are caught in a difficult position between implementing the government's decision to stabilize yarn prices and ensuring the survival of various private yarn factories. After days of discussion, they finally submitted their resignations collectively to the Textile Control Committee yesterday afternoon. The resignation letters were submitted by Wang Zhuyi, deputy secretary-general of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District, to Wu Guozhen, concurrent chairman of the Textile Control Committee, at 4 p.m. yesterday. It is reported that Chairman Wu is well aware of the current difficult situation faced by private yarn factories and expressed great sympathy. He expressed his desire to retain Wang and the others and instructed Wang to persuade the four committee members to attend a meeting at the Municipal Government this afternoon to discuss solutions to the difficulties.</p>
<p>According to Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District, yesterday, he told reporters that he and others, as members of the Textile Control Committee, are constantly seeking proper solutions for the future of China's cotton textile industry. However, the current difficulties are numerous, and they have ultimately failed to achieve a thorough solution. Feeling that continuing to hold their positions without action would be inappropriate, they had no choice but to resign. He suggested to Chairman Wu yesterday (the 17th) that a thorough plan be devised for the cotton textile industry to balance the national policy of stabilizing yarn prices and maintaining the survival of the industry. Chairman Wu expressed great sympathy for this. He believes that under this major premise, national and private yarn factories must act in unison, raw materials must be distributed equally, raw material prices must be determined, and the cost price of resumed production must be calculated reasonably and accurately. Otherwise, private yarn factories will be unable to survive, and national yarn factories will be unable to stand firm. He believes that the biggest difficulties facing the cotton spinning industry are still the shortage of cotton and the fact that negotiated prices are insufficient to cover costs. According to a survey at the end of last year, the average cotton inventory in each factory was about four to five months. Now that April has passed, the depletion of inventory in each factory is urgent. Since the sale of yarn began in September last year, not a single bale of foreign cotton has been settled. Although 24,000 bales of the 50,000 bales of cotton arriving in Shanghai from the Joint Administration have been allocated and contracts have been signed, the goods have not yet been received. There are countless practical difficulties. He hopes to obtain a thorough solution so that each factory can maintain the resumed production of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Decline in Unison</h3>
<p>There was not much change in cotton yarn at the morning opening, but when the news of Tianjin's export ban spread in the market, people's confidence waned, and asking prices declined in unison. Except for 42-count Blue Phoenix, which saw a slight increase in asking price, most other counts declined, and the situation outside the market was quite scattered.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth suddenly declined sharply. The news report of Tianjin's export ban made people nervous, and the purchasing by out-of-town buyers became sluggish. Most bulls, seeing the unfavorable situation, frequently showed signs of panic selling, and asking prices declined in unison. Dragon Head fine cloth was asking for 220,000 yuan, but few people inquired. Five Blessings was 212,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Gold Seal drill was 216,000 yuan, and other colored cloth, such as shilin, also softened.</p>
<h3>Retail Investors Selling, Unified Bonds Stable</h3>
<p>The public price market was mediocre yesterday, with only over 3 million in transactions. Unified C opened at 12,800 yuan, with a high of 13,600 yuan and a low of 12,700 yuan, and finally settled around 13,100 yuan. Retail investors were selling, while Rooms 408 and 503 were buying. As a result, Class A, B, and D bonds each rose by 800 yuan compared to the previous close, Unified E rose by 400 yuan, and Unified C remained stable.</p>
<h3>Many Off-Floor Transactions, Foreign Shares Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Foreign shares were also stimulated by domestic shares yesterday. Securities firms and various tourists were buying. Yi Sha once rose to 41,500 yuan, but then retreated slightly. There were many off-floor transactions. Asia had news of the recovery of ships, and buyers were bidding up the shares. As a result, Yeguang's asking price was 10% higher than the previous close. Yi Sha, British Union Paper, Yi Beer, Shipping, and Steel each rose by about 5%, Wheelock only saw a slight increase, rubber shares were slightly flat, and Langers offered 18,000.</p>
<h3>Domestic Shares See Strong Buying, Repeatedly Reaching New Highs</h3>
<p>Domestic shares rose yesterday because there were rumors that Gong had a lot of Yong Sha and Xinhuo stock and would cash them out in bulk. The market turned bullish after the close, and rumors fueled buying. A widespread scramble to buy started midway, repeatedly reaching new high prices. Small stocks, such as Jingfu, were advancing towards the 100 yuan target.</p>
<p>The morning opening showed mixed gains and losses. Di Yong Sha came on the market in Numbers 89, 213, 61, 17, 198, 4, and Laina. Number 145 also entered, and Spot Yong Sha gradually rose to 3,790 yuan. Spot Yong Sha also reached 3,700 yuan, and the spread had risen.

The bulls, such as Numbers 89, 198, 14, 112, and 171, successively subsidized around 100 yuan. The bears, such as Numbers 137, 155, 152, 218, and the financial group Numbers 56, 31, 220, 45, and 47, slightly struggled. However, the bulls, such as Number 145, continued to subsidize, and finally closed at a high price, with a combined daily interest rate of about 9%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Numbers 85 and 217 both entered, and Yong Sha rose to a new high price of 4,140 yuan. Numbers 231, 89, 97, 180, 148, and 218 sold out, and the market fell to 3,990 yuan. Numbers 185, 154, 94, and 145 made efforts to maintain the price, rising to 4,060 yuan. Numbers 35, 231, 185, 14, 83, 207, 149, and 186 all sold, falling to 3,910 yuan.

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau First Sells White Rice: Off-Floor Prices Continue to Rise; Rice Merchants Ask Mayor to Suppress Prices in Production Areas</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Rice prices in production areas such as Wuxi have continued to rise in recent days, which has also led to higher prices in this city. The special commissioners sent by Chairman Jiang to investigate grain prices have arrived in various production areas to effectively suppress rice prices in the production areas. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau cooperated with this measure and sold 2,000 bags of white rice, 3,000 bags of medium-grade Saigon rice, and 3,800 bags of red xian rice in the market yesterday for the first time. The sale price of white rice was 135,500 yuan per shi for bulk transactions, 141,000 yuan for negotiated transactions, and the retail price could not exceed 150,000 yuan. The sale price of Saigon rice was 110,000 yuan, 116,500 yuan for negotiated transactions, and the retail price could not exceed 125,000 yuan. The sale price of red xian rice was 120,500 yuan, 125,000 yuan for negotiated transactions, and the retail price could not exceed 132,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, only over 2,700 shi of goods were registered in the north and south markets. White japonica rice was still 144,000 yuan in the market, and off-floor prices continued to rise. White yin yuan continued to rise wildly by 10,000 yuan, and geng xian rice saw little trading. The situation was still rising. The Social Affairs Bureau's sale of nearly 10,000 bags of rice stabilized prices.</p>
<p>Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Hu Wen'an, and Hu Xiangang, the responsible persons of the rice industry, went to the Municipal Government at 9 a.m. yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu and explain the current difficulties of the rice merchants. Because prices in the production areas have been rising continuously, it is difficult for rice merchants to purchase and transport rice. They hoped that the prices in the production areas would be suppressed as soon as possible. Mayor Wu replied that the commissioners sent by the government have now arrived in the production areas to suppress prices and restore order, which should be effective within a few days. The Municipal Government will also sell white rice, Saigon rice, and red xian rice every day. The city has a large inventory of foreign rice. Recently, 450,000 bags have arrived in Shanghai, and more will be shipped in the future. This will supply the needs of the citizens and maintain prices until the new grain is harvested. Therefore, rice prices should gradually fall within a few days.</p>
<p>Import of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Foreign rice has been imported again. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai" ship arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday, carrying 2,020 tons of rice (20,200 bags) from Siam, which is now being unloaded at the Zhongzhan Wharf. Among them, 520 tons are said to be donated by the Siamese government to our government, and the remaining 1,500 tons were purchased by the China National Trust and Investment Corporation.</p>
<p>Flour Loosens</p>
<p>Another report: Flour has loosened and fallen back by 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran is selling very slowly, and the situation is sluggish. Bean cake continues to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. However, because 7,000 to 8,000 bags of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from Hankou, people's confidence suddenly softened, and the price fell back by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Green beans are selling evenly, and the price is firm. Red beans are also rising firmly. Raw peanuts from foreign firms have become weak, and local traders expect a decline of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame is stable, and corn is selling well to alcohol factories, with prices rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Frozen Fish Trade Suddenly Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Fish Merchants Association established a joint cashier's office and changed the payment method for fish vendors. Because it did not get the consent of the relevant parties, it caused opposition from the fish vendors, who stopped buying fish, resulting in no frozen fish at the market yesterday. However, the current period is the peak season for spring fish, and both production and sales parties will inevitably suffer adverse effects. At 2 p.m. yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting, including four representatives from the Fish Merchants Association, including Zhang Xinchang, four representatives from the Fish Vendors Association, including Wu Qiding, four representatives from the Seafood Transportation Association, including Jiang Guo, and fish market representatives Lu Yinchu and Ling Anlan, to discuss solutions. Department Director Wang and Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau attended. It was decided on the spot that the joint cashier's office method previously determined by the Fish Merchants Association would be suspended, and transactions would be restored immediately. A written record was made, and the responsible representatives signed it, bringing the matter to a close.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grease Prices Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>The oil and grease market fluctuated sharply. Coconut oil once soared to 850,000 yuan per dan, and there were many transactions at 800,000 yuan. However, under the high prices, many people sold out. The asking price yesterday was 600,000 yuan, and soap factories' appetite weakened, with few transactions. Asphalt, used by candle and soap factories, was still being absorbed, and the market price of Heben still stood at a high of 450,000 yuan. Prices in the production areas were very strong. According to Hongchang Trading Company in this city, there is little source of goods from Hankou, and many people who went to purchase were reluctant to start because of the high prices. Beef tallow prices are still stable, with no significant increase or decrease. Actual sales are sluggish.</p>
<h3>Appeal of the Transfer Industry</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Transfer Industry Association believes that the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway Administration's establishment of freight business offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou has oppressed and devastated the transfer industry. They invited the press yesterday and listed significant facts: (1) Exclusive joint transportation, (2) Adding mixed cars, (3) Special rights for car allocation, (4) Different car allocation, (5) Waste of tonnage, (6) Complex procedures, (7) Use of freight yards, (8) Operations of the business offices, etc.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Suddenly Soars</h3>
<p>It is reported that the money market in Hankou is extremely tight. The exchange rate for remittances to Hankou has risen to 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Banks such as the Bank of Communications are unable to recognize the remittances because Hankou has no position. Tung oil prices soared yesterday. Full-weight tung oil has risen to 440,000 yuan per dan, and Xihong has exceeded 400,000 yuan. The customer's inventory is insufficient. In addition, the tung oil market in Hankou also rose to 340,000 yuan, people's confidence is strengthening, and transactions are becoming more active.</p>
<h3>Coal Arrivals and Inventory Are Both Thin</h3>
<p>The coal market is gradually gaining traction, and people's confidence is strong. Arrivals and inventory of white coal Jiaozuo lump coal are both thin, and once it is bought up, there is another shortage. Arrivals of other small mine white coal are intermittent, and the quality varies. The usual market price has no standard. Yesterday, the asking price was 10% to 20% higher than before. Anthracite coal is continuing the previous upward trend, and market prices continue to be strong. Kaiping No. 1 layer has risen to 745,000 yuan, No. 2 layer is also close to 700,000 yuan, and low-grade goods, such as the Baoshan layer, also had a large number of transactions at 380,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Trend Is Dull</h3>
<p>The sugar market has been extremely dull in recent days. Yesterday, the opening price of Zhuang Qing was 210,000, falling back to 200,900 yuan and 200,800 yuan, with only 40 to 50 bags traded. Zhang Diao Qing initially traded at 190,000, falling to 188,000, and closed at 189,000 yuan, with 260 bags traded. Xinghua white high-grade goods traded at 300,000, medium-grade at 290,000, and Xinghua red high-grade goods at 200,000, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil and Grains Are Prohibited from Export; Edible Oil Rationing Resumes Yesterday</h3>
<p>To stabilize the people's food supply, Mayor Wu, in view of the large amount of edible oil and grains being smuggled out, telegraphed the Executive Yuan to prohibit export sales. The Executive Yuan recently approved a resolution restricting the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, cottonseed, soybean oil, crude oil, sesame oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, and other grains and oils. Mayor Wu and the Jianghai Customs discussed and agreed that from today onwards, the above-mentioned grains and oils will be restricted from export.</p>
<p>The edible oil joint allocation office resumed rationing yesterday. There were 113 retailers who went to pay and receive oil, which was not very enthusiastic. The allocation price was 400,000 yuan per dan, and the retail price could not exceed the limit of 4,400 yuan per jin. Rationing will continue today, and the black market is expected to gradually disappear.</p>
<h3>National Bank Stipulates Procedures for Foreign Cotton Exchange Settlement and Payment</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The foreign cotton import quota of US$40 million from February to April this year has been settled with Citibank by the National Bank, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper on the 15th. Yesterday, the National Bank issued Circular No. 95 to all designated banks, stipulating eight items for the foreign cotton exchange settlement and payment method, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign cotton spinning mills may apply to Citibank Shanghai through designated banks for the issuance of purchase certificates to American cotton exporters. The application form will be provided by Citibank New York. Each purchase certificate contract shall be signed by the spinning mill and co-signed by the designated bank to guarantee the payment of drafts issued under the purchase certificate.</p>
<p>(2) After obtaining the purchase certificate, the spinning mill shall prepare a draft payable at sight for the American cotton transporter to collect and present to Citibank New York for acceptance.</p>
<p>(3) The designated bank shall collect a deposit from the spinning mill equal to the purchase certificate price, calculated in national currency, and deposit it into a special account of the Central Bank called "American Cotton Deposit."</p>
<p>(4) After the American cotton is inspected and released by the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai, or 21 days after the ship carrying the American cotton arrives in port (whichever is earlier), Citibank Shanghai may submit the drafts issued by the respective spinning mills and request monthly foreign exchange allocation to pay in New York telegraphic transfer. The spinning mill shall deposit the price in national currency into the Central Bank's "American Cotton Guarantee" account. If the official exchange rate changes, resulting in an insufficient amount of national currency equivalent to the unexpired foreign exchange allocation, the spinning mill and the designated bank shall be responsible for making up the difference.</p>
<p>(5) For the portion of the price that is not yet due for foreign exchange allocation, the American cotton importing spinning mill shall issue a US dollar draft payable by the designated bank and pay it on the first business day of each month (one installment draft should be issued each month) and sign it. The draft shall be accepted by the designated bank and sent to Citibank Shanghai for the designated bank to cash out when the monthly foreign exchange allocation is due. When the installment draft is presented at maturity, the designated bank shall purchase foreign exchange on behalf of the spinning mill and remit it to Citibank New York for payment.</p>
<p>(6) The designated bank shall deliver the telegraphic transfer receipt to Citibank Shanghai and simultaneously transfer the equivalent amount of national currency from the Central Bank's "American Cotton Guarantee" account.</p>
<p>(7) The designated bank's commission for handling the purchase certificate on behalf of the spinning mill shall include Citibank Shanghai's commission of 0.0025.</p>
<p>(8) For American cotton belonging to the quota allocated from February to April, if it has already arrived in port or is already en route, when issuing the purchase certificate, the transporter needs to submit a sight draft equivalent to the full value of the landed price, which will be paid by the spinning mill after customs clearance in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 above.</p>

<h3>Resigned to Fate vs. Standing By Without Helping</h3>
<p>— Canglong</p>
<p>"Resigned to fate" is certainly not good, but "standing by without helping" is also not acceptable.</p>
<p>However, due to the realities of the situation, we are heading towards the path of "resigned to fate" or "standing by without helping." What is the reason for this? Because if we just open the newspaper and take a look, we can see news of quack doctors killing people or patients dying unjustly almost every day. If I were a patient, I wouldn't know which doctor to go to when I'm sick, because the doctor who is a living god today will become a killer quack tomorrow. Then who should I go to? None of the doctors can be trusted, so wouldn't I have to resign myself to fate? If I were a doctor, I would be praised to the heavens today, said to be a living god, but tomorrow I would be called a quack. Moreover, the newspapers are full of news of accusations, detentions, and fines. Even if I have done nothing wrong, I would be scared out of my wits. How would I still have the courage to see patients? Therefore, experienced doctors are always ambiguous and noncommittal. Even if you patients secretly suffer losses, it has nothing to do with me. You can't catch me on anything. I will earn my money properly. What can you do? Alas! This is truly a passive state of standing by without helping.</p>
<p>Is "resigned to fate" good? Of course not. Is "standing by without helping" good? Of course, it is even worse. Then what should we do? I believe that there is no other way but to raise the level of education, strive to instill medical knowledge in the public, and demand self-discipline and efforts to improve from our medical profession.</p>
<p>Alas! Looking at this group of ignorant and uneducated people and those quack doctors who only know how to make money and do not know how to improve, I can only sigh and put down my pen!</p>
<h3>On Insomnia and Its Treatment</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>"A-Luo! How come you're asleep again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I leave everything to sleep."</p>
<p>I remember in early summer three years ago, I accepted an invitation to treat a typhoid patient in Bai Xia. At that time, it was the era when the enemy and puppets were rampant. No matter what, I refused to go, but because of my old friend Luo Jun's constant pleading, I had to agree. I stayed in the patient's house for a total of fourteen days, and only after the illness subsided was I able to get away. Although it was early summer, the sultry weather in Bai Xia made people feel exceptionally stifled. Whenever I finished my medical duties, Luo Jun would accompany me in the living room for a chat, and we could talk about everything under the sun. However, after three or four days of talking, there were no more topics to talk about. So, the two of us had no choice but to stare at each other and sit silently in the living room, passing those oppressively hot afternoons. It was truly unbearable. But my friend "A-Luo" enjoyed himself and didn't mind at all. As long as you didn't have anything to say to him, he would lean back in his chair and snore away, regardless of whether I was bored or not. So, when I was bored to the extreme, I would always wake him up, calling out, "A-Luo! How come you're asleep again?" And he, always with slightly open eyes, would smile and say, "Oh, I leave everything to sleep."</p>
<p>Good, "Leave everything to sleep," that's truly blissful! Truly enviable to those of us who can't sleep. Therefore, I specifically chose this topic "On Insomnia and Its Treatment" to write about. This may be what readers suffering from insomnia want to read.</p>
<p>We all generally think that sleep is the result of fatigue, but that's not necessarily the case. According to physiological experiments, we now know that there is a nerve center in the midbrain near the brain that specializes in sleep (according to Economo's experimental report). For example, if we do an animal experiment and use a mild direct current to stimulate the so-called sleep nerve center in the animal's brain, or apply a very small amount of sleeping pills to that area, then the animal will fall asleep immediately. This type of sleep phenomenon is completely different from what we know as fainting, coma, or anesthesia, as well as the drowsiness during a mental illness attack, because the sleep phenomenon that occurs after stimulating the sleep nerve center can be awakened at any time, while fainting, coma, and anesthesia are not easy or completely impossible to wake. Based on this experiment, we know that the sleep nerve center can receive various different stimuli from the brain itself or from other parts of the body, causing it to initiate the sleep process. Conversely, if this sleep nerve center experiences an obstacle and loses its function, then insomnia can occur. Therefore, most severe cases of insomnia are due to obstacles in the base of the brain itself. In addition, we must also know that many insomnia phenomena are caused by mental suggestions, because mental stimulation and psychological unease can often affect the function of the sleep nerve center. For example, for healthy people, simply making the room a little darker, isolating it from external noise, and loosening tight clothing can make it easier to fall asleep. But for people who are easily stimulated (such as patients with mental illness or neurasthenia), it's different. Using the above method is not effective. We must use other methods, such as improving lifestyle, improving diet, improving psychological suggestions, applying mild sleeping pills, and using physical therapy, all of which are necessary. This type of insomnia in mental illness or neurasthenia has its unique characteristic, which is that as long as one can fall asleep, the sleep nerve center can fully exert its function, allowing the patient to obtain a reasonable sleep. However, if the brain is subjected to significant stimulation or the brain is damaged, or the sleep nerve center experiences an obstacle, or the patient is experiencing significant pain, then the patient, even if able to fall asleep, cannot sleep soundly and can be awakened by any stimulus at any time. The treatment for this type of insomnia, of course, starts from the root cause. If it is insomnia due to mental or neurasthenic reasons, then it naturally starts from psychological therapy or the etiology. If it is caused by pain, then we simply need to find a way to treat that symptom, and the patient will naturally be able to sleep peacefully. For example, in cases of fractures from trauma, abscesses, and tooth extractions, if we stop the pain, then the patient can naturally fall asleep. Also, people with heart disease often have difficulty falling asleep, as do people with severe coughs, and patients with angina pectoris have particular difficulty sleeping peacefully. If we remove their pain, or stop their cough, and restore their heart function, then the patient can fall asleep even without taking sleeping pills. If the above methods are still ineffective, then we can only resort to sleeping pills. These sleeping pills directly reduce the brain's ability to sense stimulation or directly affect the base of the brain itself to induce sleep.</p>
<p>We all know that elderly people have difficulty falling asleep, and even when they do, they are easily awakened. Why is this? On the one hand, it is due to physiological aging, and on the other hand, it may be due to endocrine disorders, high blood pressure, and the ineffective elimination of metabolic waste products. Many elderly people believe that they haven't slept all night and can hear every chime of the clock. But if we observe carefully, they are merely waking up and falling back asleep at any time. We must not abuse sleeping pills for this type of insomnia, as it will further damage their health.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of insomnia, I believe that psychological therapy, dietary therapy, and physical therapy should be used first. If used properly, sleeping pills are often unnecessary. For example, not eating before bed, not eating too much for dinner, avoiding fermented foods, and maintaining regular bowel movements can often help patients sleep. In my personal experience, a warm water bath before bed (a 36 degrees Celsius warm water bath for half an hour) and a warm water bath with added oxygen or carbon dioxide often have a great effect. In addition, full-body massage, electrothermal massage, and direct current massage all have good effects.</p>
<p>As for sleeping pills, I think they can be divided into four categories: (1) mild hypnotics, (2) true sleeping pills (with a longer hypnotic effect), (3) sleeping pills for the elderly (i.e., those with a slower onset of hypnotic power and a slower elimination from the body), and (4) sedatives, which are sedatives that reduce the brain's state of stimulation and can be taken as usual during the day without affecting daytime work. Some pharmacology experts divide sleeping pills into two types: one is sleeping pills that specifically anesthetize the cerebral cortex, and the other is things that anesthetize the base of the brain itself. If the dose is too large, it can attack the medulla oblongata and cause breathing to stop. Sleeping pills that anesthetize the cerebral cortex include alcohol, Chloralhydrat, Paraldehyd, and bromides. Sleeping pills that target the base of the brain itself include Luminal, Veronal, Baldrian, Pernokton, and Somnifen. We must give them full consideration and selection when using them, otherwise it is easy to make accidental mistakes. Many people casually give patients large amounts of sleeping pills, which is a mistake, because on the one hand, it leads to the risk of patients committing suicide by overdose, and on the other hand, it can cause patients to develop a habit of taking them regularly. I once saw a lady who had insomnia for three years, and her sleeping pill dosage increased from one tablet to three tablets. She couldn't fall asleep without sleeping pills every night. Later, we all took a long trip together. Because of the long journey, she felt overly fatigued and fell asleep without taking sleeping pills. Since then, she has not used sleeping pills. From this, we can infer that sleeping pills are often overused. Shouldn't we doctors carefully consider and choose these sleeping pills? As for the medicinal properties of sleeping pills, because they are specialized and limited by space, I will have to skip them for now and talk about them next time when I have the opportunity!</p>
<h3>The Mystery of New Chinese Medicine (3)</h3>
<p>— Hong Guanzhi</p>
<p>Now Mr. Lu wants to borrow the "experience" of objective experiments and associate it with Chinese medicine. Therefore, he exaggerates the value of Chinese medicine's experience. On the surface, it seems to make sense, but unfortunately, Mr. Lu still ignores the essence of "experience" and only works on the words. So, after saying it over and over again, it still doesn't help. It must be known that the "experience" in new philosophy does not refer to the result of subjective fantasy. Although it is also translated as "experience" in Chinese, the names are the same, but the reality is different. The so-called experience of Chinese medicine has not undergone objective experiments. This is a fact. Of course, it is not a valuable experience. How can we not admit that Chinese medicine's own experience is subjective just because there is objective experience! To be honest, the so-called "experience" of Chinese medicine is only personal "experience." It is not that Mr. Yu "narrows the scope of experience too much," but that is the fact. Strictly speaking, the experience of Chinese medicine is really not worthy of being called experience. Why? Objective experience, needless to say, even subjective experience must have a common understanding under the same subjective viewpoint, without ambiguity. For example, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west is common experience. Now we know that it is the earth's rotation, not really the "sunrise" and "sunset," but the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west is undeniable, and no one will ever say that it rises in the west and sets in the east. The sun has never exceptionally "risen in the west and set in the east." So, this kind of experience, although not valuable, is not too far from the truth, but it has not explained the true nature of the fact. However, the so-called experience of Chinese medicine is very different from this. One disease can be said to be phlegm, wind, dampness, or fire. Each person's diagnosis and judgment can be different, but they all claim to be experience. This is just "personal subjectivity" and cannot be called "experience." In addition, accidental and exceptional events are also associated with it, so there is even more experience. For example, if a woman's cun pulse is slippery, it means she is pregnant, and a rapid pulse also means she is pregnant... but we know that this kind of example is not common. Some pregnant women have slippery pulses, and some absolutely do not have slippery or rapid pulses. So, slipperiness and rapidity can only be seen as occasional and cannot be used as standards, because everyone is inconsistent. This kind of example, although it is the result of experience, cannot be compared with the subjective experience of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west, because this kind of diagnostic experience is not universally recognized and is too unreliable, so it cannot be called experience. All the arguments and treatments of Chinese medicine are like grasping at shadows and catching the wind. It has never clarified the treatment object, which is the essence of the disease. All the methods and results of treatment (the evaluation of treatment methods, efficacy, and drug effects) have also become unreliable records. How can it be called a field of knowledge? There are also many examples that are the result of observational errors. For example, we see a patient with epilepsy falling by the roadside. Someone gave him a bowl of ginger soup, and then he recovered. This seems to be a fact, it should be absolutely certain "experience," right? But in fact, it is not like this. If you encounter another patient with epilepsy and give him a bowl of ginger soup, he will continue to be crazy. In this way, the effect of ginger soup is unreliable! We know that there are many examples like this in the experience and treatment records of Chinese medicine. Some people record them and become "case studies" or "experienced" prescriptions. The value of this experience is really doubtful! (In fact, not all of it is effective.) If this kind of experience is also worth cherishing, then the idols in the temples are also very effective. Look at the temples, which are full of vermilion gold-lettered plaques, truly "powerful and effective." These plaques were sent in amid the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers after the gods and Buddhist disciples sincerely prayed and obtained results (?). It was not the monks or incense keepers of those temples who hung them up themselves to scare or deceive people. To put it simply, this is called a coincidental "stroke of luck." It is just a lucky coincidence, nothing great. Only the effect of drugs, part of which (not all) is the result of experiments by many people, can be called a product of "experience," but it is also subjective experience, which can only "recognize phenomena, but cannot recognize essence," and there is still a considerable distance from the truth of the facts. This kind of achievement that only knows the result but not the reason is just common sense. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Prevention and Treatment of Respiratory Diseases Complicated by Measles</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuping</p>
<p>Measles, commonly known as "cuo zi," is a highly prevalent acute infectious disease during the current period. According to clinical statistics, the mortality rate of patients is directly proportional to respiratory diseases. If patients do not develop respiratory diseases at the same time, the course of the disease is often smooth and without any danger. If high fever persists when the rash subsides, it is a sign of the development of complications. Therefore, taking precautions and preventing the occurrence of respiratory diseases is the key to treating this disease. The symptoms and prevention and treatment methods are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Laryngitis</p>
<p>Patients with measles often have laryngitis. The symptoms are (A) hoarseness, (B) a cough that sounds like a dog barking, and (C) inspiratory stridor. At this time, a diphtheria culture should be performed for differential diagnosis, as true diphtheria can also be complicated by measles.</p>
<p>Prevention and Treatment: Boil water in a kettle and direct the steam into the bed tent. Adding one teaspoon of compound benzoin tincture (Tr. Benzoin Co.) to the boiling water kettle will enhance the effect.</p>
<p>(2) Bronchopneumonia Measles complicated by pneumonia is pathologically classified as interstitial pneumonia, which is the most dangerous complication. The symptoms are as follows: (A) rapid breathing and distressed cough, (B) blue discoloration of the lips and fingernails, (C) a sudden increase in body temperature to about 40 degrees, (D) obvious physical signs in the lungs, (E) an increase in the total number of white blood cells, with a significant increase in neutrophils in the differential count.</p>
<p>Prevention and Treatment: The fewer people in the patient's room, the better. Friends and relatives should not be allowed to enter at will. Family members and servants must wash their hands immediately when contacting the patient and wear masks. After a measles diagnosis is confirmed, prophylactic doses of sulfa drugs should be started to avoid the occurrence of pneumonia. However, once pneumonia has occurred, treatment requires large doses of sulfa drugs and injections of penicillin.</p>
<p>(3) Empyema Patients with measles often develop empyema after pneumonia. The symptoms are as follows: (A) fever and septic symptoms, (B) dyspnea and cyanosis, (C) a significant increase in white blood cells, (D) obvious physical signs in the chest, (E) diagnosis can be confirmed by X-ray and thoracentesis.</p>
<p>Prevention and Treatment: Preventing pneumonia first can avoid the complication of empyema. Treatment consists of repeated aspiration and injection of penicillin.</p>
<p>(4) Pulmonary Tuberculosis Children who have been infected with tuberculosis, once they develop measles, their resistance decreases, often allowing latent tuberculosis bacteria to suddenly break out. If the spilled tuberculosis bacteria enter the blood vessels, they can flow with the blood to various parts of the body and develop miliary tuberculosis. The symptoms are as follows: (A) irregular fever that persists, (B) rapid pulse, (C) pale complexion and listlessness, (D) weight loss, (E) splenomegaly, often without physical signs in the lungs, (F) a positive tuberculin test. If most of the spilled tuberculosis bacteria invade the lung tissue, it becomes tuberculous caseous pneumonia. The symptoms and physical signs are quite similar to pneumonia, but the course of the disease is prolonged and treatment is ineffective. At this time, tests such as white blood cell counts, X-ray fluoroscopy, and tuberculin tests should be used to differentiate it from non-tuberculous pneumonia.</p>
<p>Prevention and Treatment: The fewer people who are in close contact with the patient, the better. In particular, parents, servants, or relatives and friends with pulmonary tuberculosis should be absolutely prohibited from approaching the patient. Adequate nutrition, sunlight exposure, and fresh air are also important, and streptomycin can be tried, but the prognosis of this disease is mostly very poor.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Reunion</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Wuhan grew more critical day by day, with air raids almost daily, causing widespread panic and making it impossible for anyone to focus on work, let alone life.</p>
<p>The theaters had already closed, so Lihua had to stay home. One evening, Baoling came and asked her to visit a wounded air force soldier who had been shot down during combat with enemy planes over Wuhan. Baoling wouldn't tell her who the wounded airman was, whether she knew him or not, and just dragged her along. Lihua always felt obligated to help in such situations, so she didn't ask too many questions.</p>
<p>In a hospital room facing the Yangtze River, bathed in moonlight and reflecting white waves, lay the airman they were there to comfort.</p>
<p>After the nurse led Lihua and Baoling into the room, she gently greeted the wounded airman, who responded weakly. Baoling, holding Lihua's hand, approached the bed and called out warmly:</p>
<p>"Guodong!"</p>
<p>Lihua paused, the name sounding familiar. But she couldn't place where she had heard it before. She looked intently at the patient's face: thick eyebrows, large eyes, full lips, and a messy mustache. It was the mustache that blurred her memory—the upper half of his face seemed familiar, but the lower half was a stranger. "Who is it?" "Who is it?" She strained to remember, but the more she tried, the less she could. The more she failed, the more intently she stared, as if she had forgotten a line or a whole passage of dialogue and needed to recapture it from her memory. She refused to admit her mind had lost its sharpness!</p>
<p>"You..." the patient asked hesitantly, looking somewhat lost.</p>
<p>"Don't you recognize me? Liao Dong—I'm Baoling, your old friend. And this is my sister, Lihua. She's come to see you too!" Baoling introduced them in more detail.</p>
<p>"Baoling!" The patient smiled with surprise. "It's you, Baoling! Baoling!"</p>
<p>They embraced, both shedding tears.</p>
<p>Then Lihua understood. From their enthusiasm, from their weeping, her memory conjured up the naive, lively, simple, and earnest young man who had once left her unmoved—her brother's good friend, also her brother's employer, named Liao Dong, a child of misfortune who shared the same tragic fate as her brother and herself! "Yes, it's him! It's him!" Feeling a pang of guilt, she stepped closer, her eyes beginning to moisten with emotion.</p>
<p>"She..." Liao Dong finally looked up and noticed Lihua.</p>
<p>"My sister, you've met her before, and you've heard her sing!" Baoling pulled Lihua forward again to introduce her to Liao Dong.</p>
<p>Liao Dong looked dazed, pausing as if quickly thinking something over, then excitedly reached out his hand.</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! We've met, we've met," Liao Dong said, feeling a surge of warmth in his heart, his cheeks immediately flushing red.</p>
<p>Liao Dong's shyness vividly brought back Lihua's memories, drawing her in powerfully. She grasped Liao Dong's hand tightly, her smile conveying boundless care and admiration.</p>
<p>"You're injured?" Lihua asked softly.</p>
<p>"It's nothing, just a scratch on the skin, and a slight concussion! I'm almost fully recovered now," Liao Dong replied calmly, trying to hide his physical pain with a cheerful demeanor.</p>
<p>"I was so worried when I saw the news of your injury in the paper yesterday! That's why I brought Lihua to see you today," Baoling said. "Since you're recovering so quickly, you should come stay with us for a while after you're discharged."</p>
<p>"That's great. I have a month's leave after I get out of the hospital, and I'll definitely come and have fun with you all. Especially Miss Lihua's performances—I'd love to learn from them. Six years ago, I listened to Miss Lihua's operas several times here, which sparked my deep interest. Later, in Nanjing and Hangzhou, I kept listening to operas, and not just listening—I also learned to sing and play the huqin. There's an amateur opera club at our aviation school, and I joined it and even performed on stage. I often think: how wonderful it would be if I could perform on stage with Miss Lihua one day!" Liao Dong said, growing increasingly excited, as if he had forgotten he was a patient. His mind was no longer hazy.</p>
<p>"Ah, I never imagined that after five or six years, you'd become a flying hero, a famous amateur opera performer! It's truly a case of 'a scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes!'" Baoling joked.</p>
<p>"Miss Lihua, when I get better, I'd like to become your student. Would you be willing to take me on as a disciple?" Liao Dong asked earnestly.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare, Mr. Liao!" Lihua replied, shaking her head.</p>
<p>Baoling knew Lihua disliked people bringing up opera, so she quickly changed the subject, discussing their lives over the past five or six years with Liao Dong. It was only when the nurse came to urge them to leave that Baoling and Lihua said goodbye. As they left, Liao Dong warmly grasped Lihua's hand, inviting her to come again. Lihua readily agreed as she departed. For some reason, Lihua felt a sense of reluctance, unsure if it was because Liao Dong was a war hero, because of his friendship with Baoling, or because she admired, even loved, him.</p>
<p>Similarly, Liao Dong watched Lihua leave, feeling lost and disoriented, his mind slipping back into a daze. He struggled to connect the object of his silent pursuit for years with the Lihua he had just reunited with! He felt that Lihua was even more beautiful, even more lovable than before! And he felt that Lihua was treating him better than she used to. He was excited and longed to recover his health quickly, to realize the happiness he had envisioned! He had waited six years, secretly loved for six years, and he would use his greatest courage, like charging into battle, to fight for the bright and warm spring he had dreamed of for six years!</p>
<p>Like a silent bomb, it had blown open the door to Lihua's emotions, which had long been closed! A massive illusion rushed in, so powerfully disturbing the calm sea of her heart and tightly gripping her soul! Like a shadow, it firmly stuck to her eyes, her ears, everywhere she looked, everywhere she listened. She felt an unprecedented excitement, which made her toss and turn in bed, unable to sleep all night! She couldn't yet sort out a clear train of thought to calm herself. She could only think that she had to accept and tolerate this sudden attack, that she had to embrace that illusion!</p>
<p>Two days later, Lihua went to visit Liao Dong again alone, bringing some biscuits, cakes, and other snacks, making Liao Dong almost jump out of bed with joy! Lihua quickly restrained him, quietly touched by his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Liao Dong asked Lihua many questions about Peking opera like a child, and Lihua patiently answered him, even though she had no interest in Peking opera herself.</p>
<p>"Why do you like Peking opera so much?" Lihua asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Because Peking opera is also art, and I love art. And also because of you..." Liao Dong blurted out.</p>
<p>"Because of me?" Lihua couldn't help but be surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, because your art left a very deep impression on me, so I love your art even more!" Liao Dong's face turned red again as he said the last part. In fact, he wanted to tell Lihua: he loved Peking opera because he loved Lihua. But he didn't dare, he had already mustered a great deal of courage.</p>
<p>Lihua understood Liao Dong's meaning, so she didn't pursue the matter further, and walked awkwardly to the window, gazing at the ships swaying on the river, looking like fallen leaves in the distance, or like white gulls. At that moment, she imagined being able to drift aimlessly like fallen leaves, or fly freely like gulls to the ends of the earth! Suddenly, she heard a "rumbling" sound in the air, and several iron birds soared through the clouds, followed by the mournful wail of sirens. She thought it was a steamship leaving.</p>
<p>"Damn! Another air raid!" Liao Dong said. "You should go back quickly."</p>
<p>"Air raid?" Lihua was shocked for a moment, but she didn't quite believe it.</p>
<p>"The alarm's already been sounded," Liao Dong said with some annoyance, looking out the window at the clear sky.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Lihua wanted to leave, but hesitated and stopped.</p>
<p>"I'll just lie here, there's nowhere to hide anyway," Liao Dong replied sullenly.</p>
<p>"Then I'll stay with you, there's nowhere to hide when I go back anyway," Lihua said, sitting down calmly on the edge of Liao Dong's bed.</p>
<p>In Hankou, there was indeed nowhere to hide from air raids. Every time the alarm sounded, people could only take refuge in the foreign concessions. People believed in the concessions, especially in the foreign churches within the concessions. Lihua often huddled under the eaves of one of these churches. Because she was the most timid, she would run to the church as soon as the alarm sounded; she would cover her ears when enemy planes appeared; and she would fall to the ground when bombs exploded. Only when the alarm was lifted did she dare to stand up, her whole body still trembling.</p>
<p>But today was an exception. Lihua was surprisingly brave, and she actually stayed in the hospital with Liao Dong without batting an eye. She seemed to vaguely feel a sense of security, she felt that Liao Dong was not only unafraid of enemy planes, but also fought them. If she couldn't "fight" enemy planes, she shouldn't at least "fear" them! Therefore, she forced herself to be strong! Perhaps because of the above reasons, she respected Liao Dong even more. She thought: protecting someone who could fight enemy planes was, in a way, her indirectly fighting enemy planes! Thinking this, she felt that accompanying Liao Dong today was very valuable and meaningful!</p>
<p>"You don't usually hide?" Liao Dong heard that Lihua wanted to stay with him and was both happy and surprised.</p>
<p>"No, I don't hide," Lihua said, shaking her head insincerely.</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not afraid," Lihua replied, feigning absolute calm.</p>
<p>As soon as they finished speaking, the emergency alarm and the "buzzing" of enemy planes sounded at the same time, followed by the start of the bombing. A giant bomb seemed to fall nearby, shaking the building and sending shards of glass flying from the windows with a "crashing" sound. Lihua couldn't help but shiver, although she managed not to cover her ears or fall to the ground.</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom!" There were several more explosions.</p>
<p>"Quick, get on the floor!" Liao Dong shouted as he pushed Lihua to the ground, then threw himself on top of Lihua.</p>
<p>After the frenzy of bombing subsided, there was fierce fighting overhead, with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns "cracking and popping" non-stop, as if the heavens and earth were about to be overturned.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sky was filled with red light, and black smoke billowed into the clouds like dense fog, and several rocket-like objects flew past the window.</p>
<p>"Damn it, an enemy plane has been shot down!" Liao Dong exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the wreckage of an enemy plane bearing the Rising Sun emblem fell into the river, still smoking and burning!</p>
<p>"Great!" Liao Dong cheered enthusiastically.</p>
<p>There was no response to Liao Dong's words. Based on his experience, he had discerned that the enemy plane had been shot down, and now, based on his intuition, he knew that Lihua had fainted from fright! He quickly tried to stand up, but his waist was tightly embraced by two arms. He gently tugged.</p>
<p>"Lihua!" Liao Dong called for the first time like this.</p>
<p>"Mmm!" Lihua responded, as if waking from a dream, opening her sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>"An enemy plane has been shot down. Get up and rest!"</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>Only then did Lihua gradually regain her senses, and only then did she realize that there was a man lying on top of her, covering her in a protective posture. At the same time, she was also tightly embracing this man. She glanced at him briefly, then quickly let go, saying with a mixture of shame and gratitude:</p>
<p>"Oh dear, you came down too!"</p>
<p>"The bombing was too intense just now, I was afraid shrapnel would fly in and hurt you, so I threw myself on you!" Liao Dong said as he stood up, supporting himself on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>Lihua also stood up and quickly helped Liao Dong lie down.</p>
<p>"But, you forgot about yourself!" Lihua said, her voice barely audible.</p>
<p>"Yes, I forgot about myself!" Liao Dong repeated, as if emphasizing and pondering at the same time.</p>
<p>They looked at each other and smiled slightly, thousands of words contained in that one smile! It was also in that moment of shared adversity that their friendship was like pure gold refined by fire, like going through a thousand mountains and ten thousand waters. Their hearts melted together, and their love broke through the tangible boundaries of time and space and solidified!</p>
<p>After the tension passed, Liao Dong realized in the stillness that he was a patient, and he felt the slight pain in his wound again. Lihua saw his mental exhaustion and the look on his face and knew he was uncomfortable, so she poured him a cup of tea and sat quietly to one side until he fell into a tired, perhaps peaceful, slumber.</p>
<p>By this time, the alarm had been lifted. Lihua covered Liao Dong with a blanket and then quietly left the ward. First, she found Liu Ziyun, carrying a bellyful of joy, and it so happened that Dong Shaoling was also there. She reported her experiences of the past two days to them without hesitation, although she was so shy that she almost couldn't say it. But finally, a force encouraged her, a force she had never experienced before, a force she felt was the key to her life and death. If she hoped to one day have her body and soul saved, then it was this force, this force of sacred love, that could save her!</p>
<p>Liu Ziyun and Dong Shaoling unanimously praised Lihua's experience and encouraged her to seize this happy beginning. They both gave her courage, especially Dong Shaoling, who even more excitedly urged her not to miss the opportunity!</p>
<p>"In this world, only the feelings of young people are the purest, the most ardent, and therefore the most precious. A middle-aged person, because life enters a practical stage, even love is calculated. And they don't dare to love!" Dong Shaoling expressed his very rational opinion to Lihua in a didactic tone.</p>
<p>Lihua didn't quite understand Dong Shaoling's words, thinking that the middle-aged person Dong Shaoling was talking about might be herself. But in any case, she had always trusted and admired Dong Shaoling. She admitted that Dong Shaoling had indeed not dared to love her in the past, but she did not hate Dong Shaoling because of it.</p>
<p>"Then, I believe your words, and I will start to love him, and I will love him forever!" Lihua said bravely, like taking an oath, holding back her heartbeat.</p>
<p>"That's right! If you can do that, you will get immortal happiness!" Dong Shaoling said cheerfully, as if relieved of a heavy burden.</p>
<p>"But there are still obstacles ahead, I must first hide it from my mother!"</p>
<p>Lihua's words were true. Mrs. Mo was the obstacle between her and Liao Dong, but she was constantly preparing to defend against this obstacle. She estimated that one day she would also bravely break through this obstacle.</p>
<p>Next, Lihua rushed to the hospital many more times, and also shared many more hardships with Liao Dong, until Liao Dong recovered from his injuries, moved out of the hospital, and lived in her home. They became even closer for a period of time. Except for Mrs. Mo, almost everyone knew about their love. Baoling was naturally one of the sponsors, and Liyun was even more enthusiastic. Even Jin Qilin, in the capacity of an old friend, old colleague, and old brother, was trumpeting loudly on the sidelines, hoping that this drama "The Dragon and the Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness" could be successfully performed, and he could play the role of Zhao Yun as a cameo.</p>
<p>So, Lihua and Liao Dong were conducting friendship, conducting love, and conducting a farther, wider, and more solid path of common life in a chorus of support!</p>
<p>Liao Dong's body had not fully recovered, especially his heart was still a little weak. He used his vacation to recuperate, while also working hard for a happy goal. Therefore, he felt stimulated when he occasionally encountered some difficulties! Only Baoling understood this situation, and Baoling used the words she had used to advise him in Jingzhou more than ten years ago to advise him again.</p>
<p>"Strengthen your will! When you strengthen your will, your body and mind will become stronger!" Baoling said with unwavering certainty.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Liao Dong had the same attitude towards love as he had more than ten years ago towards that rotten family. He was also determined about love! Even though the future was still very bleak! But he had "strengthened" his belief that "where there's a will, there's a way." He trusted himself, and he trusted all the friends who helped him, especially his close friend Baoling.</p>
<p>Lihua accepted a new destiny with the same feeling! She changed her attitude of being silent and rarely smiling over the years. She, Liao Dong, and Baoling, Liyun, played without restraint, talked candidly, like they were childhood sweethearts, restored innocence, and restored vitality!</p>
<p>Good things are often difficult. The Wuhan evacuation order was issued, and Liao Dong had to obey orders and return to his unit ahead of schedule. Lihua also had to buy a boat and go west with Liu Ziyun and everyone else.</p>
<p>Sudden gatherings and sudden departures, they could only say "see you later" to each other. A layer of melancholy shrouded Lihua's heart again!</p>
<h3>Flowers and Birds</h3>
<p>— Old Man Hongwei</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 319</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I am terribly sorry, Mr. Tsurumi..."</p>
<p>This loud voice struck Tsurumi's eardrums, shaking him up and immediately restoring his normal sight and hearing. He saw standing before him a thin old man, a white beard more than a foot long hanging from his chin, dressed in an old-fashioned Korean gentleman's outfit, his eyes appearing very gloomy. At the same time, Tsurumi discovered that his right hand was held by two extremely smooth, soft hands, taking his pulse.</p>
<p>"Everything is normal, Dad." A clear and lovely voice came from beside Tsurumi; before she had finished speaking, the pair of soft hands holding Tsurumi's right hand had already gently withdrawn, and the person had also stood up. In Tsurumi's eyes, she was a beautiful young woman of twenty-one or twenty-two, also dressed in Korean clothes.</p>
<p>"Very good, child, you may retire." The old man spoke in an impure Japanese accent, waving his hand as he spoke, his expression still gloomy.</p>
<p>As Tsurumi watched the woman leave the room, he straightened his sitting posture and took a look at the room's furnishings. Judging by the arrangement, he knew this was a guest room.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tsurumi, I think I should fully explain a few things..." The old man sat down across from Tsurumi.</p>
<p>"No need...!" Tsurumi interrupted the old man's words in a commanding tone, "I will ask a question, and please answer a question; because my time is extremely valuable." Tsurumi glanced at the watch on his wrist.</p>
<p>"As you wish," the old man's tone was very gentle, but his manner of speaking, combined with his bell-like voice, implicitly displayed a noble status.</p>
<p>"Do you have a telephone here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but..."</p>
<p>"Please call my companion here!"</p>
<p>The old man did not make a sound, but gently clapped his hands twice. Before the applause had stopped, someone had already pushed the door open and entered, a sturdy young man. The old man did not instruct the young man what to do, but first apologized to Tsurumi, "This child does not understand Japanese, please do not take offense." After speaking, he spoke two sentences in his native language, and the young shadow responded and left.</p>
<p>"Is it far from here to the International Grand Hotel?" Tsurumi asked.</p>
<p>"A fifteen-minute car ride."</p>
<p>"Is the anesthetic you use in your car very harmful to human health?"</p>
<p>"Not at all harmful to health; I myself am a medical technician and also a doctor. I can guarantee this."</p>
<p>"I have already expressed my frankness to your subordinates, why do you still have to go through these unnecessary procedures?"</p>
<p>"The children's actions are not free, I am terribly sorry..."</p>
<p>Before the old man had finished speaking, the young man had already led Masa-iwa in.</p>
<p>"Masa-iwa-kun, please first call the Mansei-kan and ask the maid on duty in our room for news of Miss Nakamura; then call the place you reserved and tell them to entertain your friends, in case we are too late to arrive—it's already three o'clock!"</p>
<h3>D'Annunzio is Insatiable</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>Called the poet, novelist, playwright, artist, aviator, soldier, lover, dreamer... of contemporary Italy, Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) was truly a remarkable figure. During World War I, he had helped France somewhat, so later, the French all respected him. Those who wrote to him would only write "To Italy's Greatest Poet." D'Annunzio seemed dissatisfied, saying, "Am I only Italy's greatest poet? You should also call me the world's greatest poet!"</p>
<h3>Shakespeare: Sonnets</h3>
<p>— Zhenqin (Translator)</p>
<p>Sonnet XVIII</p>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</p>
<p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</p>
<p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
<p>And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</p>
<p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</p>
<p>And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;</p>
<p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
<p>By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;</p>
<p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</p>
<p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</p>
<p>Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</p>
<p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:</p>
<p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p>
<p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
<p>Sonnet XXIX</p>
<p>When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,</p>
<p>I all alone beweep my outcast state</p>
<p>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries</p>
<p>And look upon myself and curse my fate,</p>
<p>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</p>
<p>Featured like him, like him with friends possess’d,</p>
<p>Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,</p>
<p>With what I most enjoy contented least;</p>
<p>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,</p>
<p>Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</p>
<p>Like to the lark at break of day arising</p>
<p>From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;</p>
<p>For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings</p>
<p>That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</p>
<p>Sonnet XXXIII</p>
<p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen</p>
<p>Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,</p>
<p>Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</p>
<p>Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;</p>
<p>Anon permit the basest clouds to ride</p>
<p>With ugly rack on his celestial face,</p>
<p>And from the forlorn world steal his sweet view,</p>
<p>And in that time do sluggishly subside</p>
<p>Even so my sun one early morn did shine</p>
<p>With all triumphant splendor on my brow;</p>
<p>But out, alack, he was but one hour mine;</p>
<p>The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.</p>
<p>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;</p>
<p>Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.</p>

<h3>City Appearance</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>The construction of a city originates from history, geography, politics, economy, as well as academic culture, creating various different forms. China uses city walls as fortresses, and civilian houses also use high walls and deep courtyards, iron window bars, and railings for leaning. Vermillion doors and gilded characters, light carriages and fat horses – these are all features of feudal life.</p>
<p>Medieval European cities also had narrow stone roads, gloomy houses, and strong, thick-walled castles, revealing traces of war everywhere. When it came to Renaissance cities, it was as if flower buds were unfolding tender petals; palaces and pavilions became increasingly ornate, and fortress forms became decorations. The city and residential areas became integrated, and commerce gradually flourished, so-called city appearance also became prominent.</p>
<p>The greatest buildings in a city are temples and government offices. In modern times, attention is paid to public life and cultural undertakings, such as museums, national theaters, universities, libraries, and academies. These buildings, in the city center, have become a treasure trove commonly owned by the people, not products of the era of emperors and nobles, so the city appearance is also different.</p>
<p>In Chinese cities, apart from temples and government offices, there are no great buildings in civilian houses, and even less attention is paid to color. The use of wood is not sturdy. The wealthy only have a multi-story pavilion, from which they can look out over a scene of flat houses, black and white like tree ear mushrooms cooked with tofu, so the city appearance is plain and unremarkable.</p>
<p>The greatest buildings in a city elevate the spirit of its citizens, like the Gothic cathedrals of Northern Europe. In foggy and rainy weather, one can only see the high tower of the cathedral from afar. We know that the cathedral with the high tower must be the center of the town, and nearby there must be parks, markets, post offices, cafes, as well as schools and city halls, etc. Such towers are products of Northern Europe. Southern Europe, with its bright weather, only emphasizes decorative facades and substantial interiors, which is very different from the situation in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Near the Swiss Alps in Europe, various city appearances have been formed due to the beautiful mountain and lake scenery. Near the Mediterranean coast of Nice and Monaco, the mountains and fields are full of exotic flowers and fragrant plants. The perfumes and soaps that France supplies to the world all come from here. Ancient Italian cities want to preserve historical sites, so they do not change the entire city. When we walk through the streets, it is as if we are people from the Middle Ages. Although these are products of the feudal era, they have become museums and art pieces. Only the form remains for appreciation, and the spirit is exceptionally pleasant.</p>
<p>The focus of Chinese city appearance is government offices, while temples are mostly in remote places. Buildings everywhere are in the same format, without much change, and there is no special creation due to historical, geographical, cultural, production, or occupational relationships. For example, there is not much difference between cities by the sea and cities in the mountains. Even Hangzhou and Suzhou, although elegant, have not created a special style in terms of city appearance. There are some large buildings in Beiping, but the city is still largely the same.</p>
<p>The city appearance I am talking about is like a person's face, which can be recognized at a glance as a certain type of person. History, locality, must be preserved, as well as the customs and culture of the people, all must form a special spirit of a city. This spirit, integrating and penetrating the history of human culture, has special value! Why doesn't Kunshan have a Kunqu opera research association? Why doesn't Nanjing have Six Dynasties literature and art? Why doesn't Xi'an have an archaeological society? Why doesn't Beiping have a national theater? Shanghai is a major commercial port in the Pacific Ocean, so why doesn't it have a world museum? Why not create an international cultural city?</p>
<p>City appearance is alive, not dead. Even preserving an ancient city, repairing damaged buildings according to ancient formats, is still a living culture! It is still for living people to appreciate, study, and recreate. City appearance is like a person's face, with expressions and cultivation, a lively and spirited face, like a scholar who has been to countries all over the world. This face, of course, has different styles and qualities. City appearance is the same, using history, geography, politics, economy, and all cultural academics to create a beautiful city appearance!</p>
<h3>Serious Loss</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>"Have you ever made a serious mistake while treating patients?" a friend asked a famous surgeon.</p>
<p>"Only once," the surgeon replied.</p>
<p>"Was it a fatal mistake?"</p>
<p>"Almost. That time I charged one million yuan for the surgery, but later I found out he actually had three million."</p>
<p>Wanye Bookstore recently published the book "A's Son," written by the Soviet V. Kazayev, translated by Mao Dun, who is about to return to China. It describes the patriotic story of a young Soviet protagonist, Vanya, during World War I, vividly depicting and full of legendary colors. Also, Sun Ling's full-length novel "The Blizzard" will also be published soon.</p>

<h3>Letters from Abroad</h3>
<p>— Xin Zi</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Naval Training in England</p>
<p>Brother ××:</p>
<p>I was in the midst of packing my luggage when I suddenly received your letter, which made me extremely happy. I cannot express my joy and happiness with my poor pen. Thank you for your kindness in telling me the news from home and the recent developments of my friends. I am immensely grateful to you. You are probably very concerned about my life, right? Now, let me tell you about our training on British warships. Please also send my regards to those friends whom I miss dearly.</p>
<p>When we first arrived here, we spent our days living on the parade ground. From morning to night, we were in a state of nervous excitement. After six weeks, our basic training ended, and a new life began. We spent our days in the classroom, which was much more comfortable than training on the parade ground. The English are truly down-to-earth in their work, much more thorough than we are. For example, in the morning, we have course A, and in the afternoon, we immediately go to the Cinema to watch movies – the English have made films of all naval operations. The next day, we have to practice it ourselves. This kind of education has a great effect. At the same time, this method is very worthy of adoption by our country. After six weeks of classroom life, we held a final exam. The results were very surprising to the British. According to one of the instructors, Mr. Smith, British soldiers could never accept a course like our six weeks. Little did they know that we are all a group of students. In the education level of British soldiers, they are only primary school graduates. Anyone with a secondary school education is an officer, similar to the situation in our country. The British all believe that the quality of Chinese soldiers is not bad, but only Heaven knows.</p>
<p>In England, being a soldier is welcomed everywhere. One person serving in the military brings glory to the whole family. At the same time, the salary of each soldier can support his family and live in a fairly well-off situation. Every three months, there is a Long Leave (about two weeks). Compared with Chinese soldiers, there is a world of difference. But the British territory consists of only three islands, and resources are still insufficient to be self-sufficient. Everything depends on the supply from the colonies. Why can they manage the country so well? If our country's politics and people were like England, wouldn't we also be a first-class country in the world? British parties are also quite complex and are also competing with each other, but their methods are different from ours. They completely adopt a democratic style, using propaganda to win the hearts of the people.</p>
<h3>On the Ingenuity of Literary Thought</h3>
<p>— Mu Tao</p>
<p>Chinese characters are full of mystery. In the past, Mr. Xu Zhushi of my hometown (named Jingcheng, posthumously named Wensu), one of the three loyalists of Zhejiang in the庚子Year (who served as an envoy to foreign countries), when he was at the Jiaxing Guild Hall group worship (Beijing prefectural hall, group worship once a year, but no opera performances), during the banquet, he told a story: There was someone who was good at English, and he often boasted that he could translate Chinese characters, but there were many jokes. For example, "Resolving conflicts at the negotiating table" was translated as "Running around with horses and fighting next to wine glasses and chopsticks;" "Hundreds of birds singing together" was translated as "Two cranes, plus a white bird." Moreover, the six writing principles use pictographs and ideograms, with phonetic loans being the most numerous. In addition, there are so-called fanqie (a method of indicating the pronunciation of a Chinese character), and so-called circle tones. Foreign characters have absolutely no such functions, or allowances. But taking the circle tone as an example, a character circled in four corners can change all four tones: level, rising, departing, and entering. For example, the character "唯" (wéi, only), can be used interchangeably with the character "惟" (wéi, only). Adding a circle in the upper corner means "to answer," the pronunciation and meaning, as well as the tone, all change.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a lantern riddle with the face being a beauty applying rouge to her lips, and the answer was "Zengzi said '唯之唯子'," because the character "唯" has a red circle on its mouth. There was also a riddle with the face being the character "亞" (yà, second) with a red circle in one corner, and the answer was "To push away the heart of evil, to push away the new evil." Only two characters are used, symbolizing 重欄 (chóng lán, double railing). The upper character "亞" has a red circle, symbolizing the corner of the setting sun. The indescribable ingenuity of literary thought is like this.</p>

<h3>Bird Language Poetry</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>When I read bird language poetry, I feel that the ancients were all able to incorporate bird language into poetry, making it very enjoyable. I always think of recording it for remembrance, but I have no large enough material to title it. In Qing Dynasty Sun Shiqiao's "Odds and Ends," dozens of kinds of bird language poetry are collected. The sound of the turtledove is vaguely like: "Bugu (cuckoo)," "Take off pants," "Feet but cloth pants," "Take off broken hull," "Cut wheat and plant rice," "Guo's wife beats mother-in-law," "One hundred into one," "Grandpa and grandma," "Fight millet," "Harvest grain," "Winnow grain," "Every household scatters grain," "Quickly cuckoo," "Sister-in-law blames mother-in-law," "Quickly mend pants."</p>
<p>The nightingale's cry sounds like: "Zigui (return home)," "Sister return," "Urge return," "Better to return."</p>
<p>The oriole's cry sounds like: "Mud slippery," "Cha cha cha."</p>
<p>The cuckoo's cry sounds like: "Gu e (father-in-law is evil)," "Shrike," "Bitter bitter."</p>
<p>The crow's voice sounds like: "Jia li (plow)," "Jia jia ge ge."</p>
<p>The mockingbird's voice sounds like: "Wake up wake up."</p>
<p>The mountain bird's voice sounds like: "Ti hu (carry pot)."</p>
<p>'s voice sounds like: "Phoenix is not as good as me, get by," "How to get by?"</p>
<p>The phoenix's voice sounds like: "Return to play," "Ti jue (carrying)," "Good."</p>
<p>The peacock's voice sounds like: "Du huo (all harvest)."</p>
<p>The partridge's voice sounds like: "Cannot go, brother!" "Hook and yoke."</p>
<p>The Yichun bird's voice sounds like: "Spring is gone, spring is gone!"</p>
<p>The partridge's voice sounds like: "Guo gong (Duke Guo)," "Buddha appears," "Woodpecker," "Dig bamboo shoots," "Sell tiles," "Press oil," "Sister-in-law," "Wet wet," "Gua gua," "Tell the teacher," "Don't be angry, old man," "Jianzhou ghost," "Evil woman words," "Cart carries boards," "Months pass by," "Road cannot pass," "Yellow frightens children," "Kill aunt," "Strange strange," "Aunt bitter," "Brother bitter," "Gua gua gua," "Water...brother."</p>
<p>The duck's voice sounds like: "Gaba porridge."</p>
<p>The sparrow's voice sounds like: "Zhe zhe zhe."</p>
<p>The pigeon's voice sounds like: "Die...die."</p>
<p>The thrush's voice sounds like: "Ruyi ruyi (as you wish)."</p>
<p>The swallow's voice sounds like: "Who is like this?" "Although similar to this?" "Who dies first?" "Sleeping Xishi (a beauty)," "Better than Xishi."</p>
<p>Others like: "Anxious," "Qingming drunk," "Child returns," "Do not pick flowers and fruits," "Wear the new and take off the old," "Beat wheat and make rice," "Take off cloth shirt," "Yo," "Mountain is on fire," "Bitter ah bitter!" "Wheat ripe forging," "Jiao jiao sang zhi," "Fa ke fa ke (get promoted)," etc. All are bird languages, and poets use similar meanings to enter poetry.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But these people were even worse than ants, they only cared about themselves, and did not care about others. The young and strong, along with countless people wearing uniforms that looked like soldiers but weren't, launched an attack like a melee, scattering all the old, weak, women, and children, and rushed onto the train like wolves and tigers; the railway staff on and off the train retreated far away as if watching a fire from across the river, and did not care no matter what. —— In reality, they really couldn't care!</p>
<p>Old Zhu, Old Huang, Ah Li, and Lan's cousin, four men, with a spirit of desperation, protected Lan, Feifei, Rong'er, and six or seven pieces of luggage, pushing, squeezing, leaning, supporting, struggling, and fighting hard for sixty or seventy minutes in the surging crowd, only managing not to be pushed over by stronger people again, and not to retreat, but that crocodile-like train was still within sight but out of reach.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm scared! I don't want to go up!" Just when everyone was panting, sweating, and at a loss, Rong'er, held in Lan's arms, cried out loudly again.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, child, it'll be fine once we get on the train!" Lan frowned tightly, and tried her best to comfort her beloved son in a very gentle voice.</p>
<p>But the steam of the crowd and the roar of human voices were really too much for this five-year-old child to bear. As if he hadn't heard his mother's words, he burst into tears and shouts, even struggling hard, trying to jump to the ground.</p>
<p>This startled the other four men who were using all their strength to squeeze forward. Old Zhu was the first to turn around to look at them, and his original intention was also to help Lan coax little Rong to calm down; but as soon as his gaze fell on Feifei's face, squeezed between Lan and Old Huang, his heart couldn't help but beat wildly.</p>
<p>"Feifei! Feifei!" He hurriedly lowered his head to shout. (47)</p>
<h3>Love and Confinement</h3>
<p>— Ding Ren</p>
<p>According to a report, a Mr. Huang in Xixiang, Chongqing, because his son was still studying in junior high school, only seventeen years old, started to fall in love with a Miss X, his father was furious when he heard the news, and immediately confined this "incorrigible" son at home for three years, recently released by relatives.</p>
<p>From this news, I have understood a serious educational problem, and at the same time I am wondering if we are still living in the 1950s?</p>
<p>In European and American countries, social interaction between men and women is open, which is a well-known fact. In their school curriculum, children of eight or nine years old begin to understand how flowers, plants, insects, and various small animals bloom, bear fruit, conceive, and reproduce, all the way to how humans give birth to children, they all understand very clearly. It is never like Chinese families, where children ask their parents where they came from, and the parents' answer is either to make up a lie to deceive them, or to scold the child. However, such a result not only creates a mysterious veil over these issues for the child, but also forces the child to obtain knowledge from improper places to satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>The seventeen-year-old youth in Chongqing was imprisoned at home for three years for falling in love, which is really a great injustice. Fathers (or teachers) should explain the advantages and disadvantages, and persuade them from the aspects of physiology and academics, rather than deceive them. Lying or even coercion cannot solve the problem. In fact, understanding a matter thoroughly is necessary to convince people; otherwise, no matter how great your ability to fabricate lies, once they are exposed, it is irreparable. Take this Mr. Huang as an example. After being released from three years of confinement, his love for Miss X has not been interrupted since then, but on the contrary, it is very likely to intensify. If such a consequence really occurs, I believe that this is by no means what this father had expected!</p>
<h3>Close Call</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Three church members from 省 (a province) attended a service one day. After the pastor finished preaching, in order to help the disaster victims, he asked the audience to donate money. The three church members were extremely nervous. Finally, the pastor walked up to them with the plate. One of the church members fainted when he saw it, and the other two carried him up and walked out of the church.</p>
<h3>Watching "The Three Friends of Winter"</h3>
<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>The drama school's second public performance of "The Three Friends of Winter" has obviously improved compared to the last time. Chen Baichen's script, although a tragedy, often makes people laugh because the characters he writes often have catchphrases and special habits. Especially in this play, there is Dr. Li, a naturally humorous person, who can give people an unbearable burst of laughter even in the most tense moments.</p>
<p>The performance effect was very good, the actors were generally good, and the set design was indeed painstaking. The snow scene outside the window in the third act was quite beautiful, except that the sky was a bit too bright. Wu Tian's direction reached a state of perfection in the complex scene in the first act and in the dialogue between Shen Yong and Li Zhuye in the third act. He did not miss several tense climaxes.</p>
<h3>Arts and Culture Scene</h3>
<p>Ma Sihong, Wu Leyi, Huang Yuanyin, Chen Liqing, Ma Sisun, etc., went to Xinjiang last month to perform music for Chairman Zhang. It is said that 25,000 people listened to the performance, and they returned to Shanghai on the 7th of this month. (Ping)</p>
<p>"Good Fortune Smile Upon You," starring Lin Bin and Qiao Qi, will begin filming as soon as "Caught in the Net" is finished. (Ya)</p>
<p>Taiwan's only amateur theater group is named "Everyone's Drama Research Society," which is run entirely by Taiwanese actors. It is the successor to the "Ren Ju Zuo" (Human Drama Troupe) established by Taiwanese people before the Retrocession. The leader, Lin Boqiu, graduated from the Tokyo Actors School and worked as a director on the Tokyo stage for fifteen years, known for directing comedies. After the Retrocession, he directed several plays in Taiwan, such as "Sin" and "Medical Ethics," which were well-received by Taiwanese people. (Feng Qian)</p>
<p>The large-scale literary magazine "Wen Chao Monthly" (Literary Tide Monthly) April issue has been published, including Chen Shouzhu and Qin Xilian's literary theories, Shi Shucun's poetry research, Wang Wangshu Hu Mu's essays, Zhang Shifang, Zhang Qiqu, Li Baifeng, 's Rain's novels, Tian Qin, Yi Fan's poems, Lu Xiaoman's preface to Zhimo's Diary, a full-length serial translated by Yu Shen and people, and Wang Jin 赵Wang 　 and Zhao Wang's Chinese paintings, etc. The price is 2,000 yuan, and it is sold by Zhengzhong Bookstore and its branches in various places.</p>
