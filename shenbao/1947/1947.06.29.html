<h3>美國宣布加強援華　出售軍火考慮貸款　我政府將發表決策聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕政府對當前時局之決策，或將發表正式文告，聞該項文告可能於卅日中政，中常聯席會後發表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕官力今日對美國取消軍用物資運往中國之禁令深表歡迎，稱之爲美國政策中最有意義之一步。僉信美國之取消軍火援華禁令以及進出口銀行董事長馬丁之準備對貸款之聲明，已加強南京政府之地位，並一掃美國將漠視中國問題之疑懼。國軍士氣必將為之一振，對共軍之討伐令或亦將因之而迅速頒布，對蘇聯之外交，特別在處理旅大問題時，亦必將取更强硬之態度矣。又立院經委會委員長樓桐孫評美國進出口銀行馬丁之聲言稱：前中國所急需者，爲自美國立即取得大宗借款，「以穩定中國之經濟地位」。樓氏拒絕絕露政府在取得美國借款後是否將發行新幣以穩定經濟地位，然據消息靈通方面表示，此確，政府之計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕中國政府急難，美國爲予以道義與物質上之支持，故以槍彈售予中國，供國軍對付中共軍之用。此因國軍在東北堅苦遏阻共軍之進展及蔣主席與其高級顧問推行其張硬反蘇與反共政策，遂決定予以此項援助，此舉亦即馬歇爾將軍於一九四五年赴華調解時所持對中國內戰之中立政策歷時十八個月後宣告結束之謂。美國現在　已以一切力量援助蔣主席對付共產黨，不久并可望其對中國進行巨額與畏期之經濟援助計劃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓日七日電〕國務院宣布，美國已允以美軍剩餘步槍子彈售予中國。中國政府並得備款向美軍購買任何飛機或其他軍備，同時且得向美國商辦製浩廠購買軍備。進出口銀行亦宣布，該行將攷慮以特種借款貸予中國。國務院及進出口銀行此舉，想已得國務鄉馬歇爾認可，雖不失爲馬氏於一月間放棄調解中國內戰以來之重大決定，惟與中國政府所申請者，相差甚巨。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿七日電〕美國務院廿七日宣布：國外淸算委會業與中國方面簽訂協定，以七，九二糎之軍火一千三百萬發售予中國政府，售價為六五六·六五八美元，此項軍火原價値則爲六·五六六·五八九美元。此項軍火與卅口徑步槍軍火類似，乃美國於一九四二至一九四四年間所造者，原爲應中國之請，按照租借辦法運華，惟因戰時運輸困難，未能如期運出，此項軍火乃中國方面特別口徑所用者，故不適於美軍之用，遂成爲美政府之　　物資，近儲藏西部各州，一切運華問題，將由中國政府自行處理。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕進出口銀行董事長馬丁廿七日宣布：進出口銀行刻正準備考慮對中國各項特別計劃之信用貸款，而不顧指撥中國政府機關及私人企業之其他可能信用貸款五億美元至六月三十日期限屆滿後之失效，此乃美官方第一次宣布去年四月指撥中國之五億美元貸款，將聽其於限屆滿時失效。馬氏並說明進出口銀行在米糧任何貸款申請時，將注意指導對世界全部區域貸款活動之基本原則，渠稱：進出口銀行在遵循國會所所百定之政策時，僅將對（一）促進美國之對外貿易，（二）並不與私人資本競爭，（三）具有特別目的，（四）董事會認爲有償還之合理保證等各方面，給予貸款。馬丁之聲明，事實上即表示復興信用貸款計劃之行動，刻正回復其原來之主要目的，即資助及便利美國之特別進出口，此包括資助美國之工具及技術業務，以供國外之生產事業。渠又說明，進出口銀行之一般規則，即僅在資助購買美國所產或製造之物資及工具，以及雇用美國公司之技術人員，此與借款國家在其本國購買之物資及僱用人員之經費有別</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕政府發言人，廿八日晚就華府電傅美進出口銀行宣布關於五億美元貸款限至六月底止不再延期一事談稱：外部尙未接護此項述知之正式文件。同時，亦未接獲我駐美大使之報告，故官方對此尙不能表示任何意見。至於六月底期限屆滿，五億貸款成立與否，吾人尙對未來之兩日作一最後之希望。另據記者自其他方面獲悉，政府確有對美作新借款之洽商。</p>
<h3>無底親美親蘇應以國家為重</h3>
<p>孫科演講世界局勢</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕副主席孫科，廿八日晚八時應留美同學會邀，就目前世界局勢演說稱：世界第三次火戰之能否避免關鍵，在於美。蘇兩國關係之能否調和及加强聯合國機構。至於中國，旣不應親美反蘇，尤不應親蘇反美，如中共在東北所爲，有良心者不能出此，吾人親美親蘇，均應以國家民族利益爲前提，吾人親美，因彼有利於中國、吾人親蘇，因可使國家安定，安定則可獲得復興，前數日外部公布與蘇聯交涉收回旅大之經過，將吾人之立塲及我政府不能接收東北之原因公諸世界，依渠個人觀察，此適足促使中蘇兩國解除誤會，益臻親善。</p>
<h3>王寵惠論時局　盼美積極援華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國府委員王寵惠定明後日返京，昨對記者表示，東方局勢之惡化及美國與論之覺醒，使美政府採取軍火援助之辦法。我國抗戰八年，剩餘之軍需數量有限，故目前之援助雖不直接，但已開闢我軍火之來源，足見其協助國民政府之誠意。本人希望此僅爲初步援助，以後能更形積極。因我國之局勢與處境，與希。土兩國無殊，以常理而論，亦當得同等程度之支持。再進一步言，我國目前危局之造成，英。美均當負一部份責任，因兩國均爲雅爾達密約之簽字國家。我國因中蘇條約而蒙受重大犧牲，但仍未換得和平。對於美進出口銀行借款期限之未能展延，王氏認爲展期已不止一次，如不能直接借款，則延期亦無益，希望美政府能另用其他辦法。美國旣有意援助，途徑殊多，我國只求達到借款目的，其他辦法均所歡迎。記者詢以對目前巴黎外長會議之看法，王氏稱：因國際局勢太複雜，値茲開會之初，不能作預測。但以常理推斷，蘇聯對馬歇爾國務卿之援歐計劃，或可作有條件之接受。</p>
<h3>立院休會期近院長委員互宴</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立院休會期近，廿八日午晚全體委員與孫吳正副院長兩度歡宴，午爲孫吳作主，與宴者一五一人，立院簡任以上職員均參加，晚全體回宴於華僑招待所。該院下月三日舉行最後一次會後即休會兩月，故今日宴會情緒極爲歡洽，孫院長於午宴時致詞，稱讀立院已往之成就，尤其有關行憲法規，能於最短期內制定完成，有助於如期行憲，實堪佩慰。孫氏指出立院組織擴大後，新選立委與原任立委會於一堂，縱為議案而爭持不下，然彼此於議塲之外，和睦融洽，充分表現已具有民主精神，此點最為寳貴。渠並述及下週最後一次會後谷委員有多年未返原籍者，盼能各回家鄉，參與競選。孫氏復介紹吳鐵城調：「吳副院畏原在國民黨內担任重要職務，並任提名委會召集人，今後立委競選，不問其爲國民黨，民社黨，靑年黨及社會賢達，吳副院長定能協助。」吳鐵城亦即席致詞，渠提及十五年前曾任立委事，謂現在等於回家。吳氏稱讀立院過去成就，表示願與各委員共同努力，在行憲之前，將應修正及制定之立法案件，早日究成。劉委員監訓則代表立委致答詞，對孫吳兩氏之將十譽，表示感謝，並願繼續努力，完成　政大業。</p>
<h3>無標誌飛機　炸甘省寧縣</h3>
<p>投彈廿八枚損失頗重</p>
<p>〔中史社蘭州廿八日電〕西峯鎭廿七日電，廿二日下午一時，寗縣突有無標誌之轟炸機一架，飛臨上空，於盤旋一週後，即向城區濫施轟炸，投彈廿八枚，死三人，傷四人，房屋器具損失尤重。</p>
<h3>司使由京飛抵平　主持燕大畢業禮後返京　認中國問題雖嚴重並非絕無辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕七月四日為美國獨立紀念日，司徒雷登大使定是日下午五時至八時，在大使官邸舉行酒會，招待各國外交使節，我方首長，及各界。司使以　大畢業典禮即舉行，廿八日晨八時偕顧問　涇波飛平主持，將於七月二日返京。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕司使廿八日午十二時半自京飛抵平，當返　園，記者趨訪於臨湖軒，大使稱：（一）中國使用計劃未　妥，五億貸款期限雖將截止，但款仍可保留，　中國另外提出使用計劃，此並不因三十日期滿而消失。（二國對東北及白塔山事件不斷予以嚴密注視，惟整個人認爲國際問題者，乃不出中國內部間題，如中國內部健全，即可無外患。（三）國共問題余希望能再有一次商談，使得一最後和平機會。渠認國共何者能獲勝，胥視人民團結力量之向背而定，渠個人認爲，政府仍可有辦法以爭取民衆擁護。（四）目前中國問題雖極嚴重，但非絕無辦法，此胥視中國人民團結力量發揮如何耳。大使決俟參加燕大畢業禮後，即於二日返京。</p>
<h3>最高法院檢察署通令緝辦毛澤東</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕最高法院檢察署頃令全國各高等法院首席檢察官，飭屬嚴緝毛澤東，全文如下：</p>
<p>案據甘肅高等法院院長業在疇。首席檢察官詹世銘呈，據成縣參議會議長汪作柱等呈，以毛澤東擁兵倡亂，請依法制裁，以平民憤等情，據此，理合呈請鈞長鑒核等情前來。查該逆毛澤東，竊據國土，稱兵叛亂，禍國殃民，罪大惡極，自應依法緝辦，除分令外，合行令仰該首席檢察官飭屬一體嚴緝，務獲究辦，以伸法紀。此令。</p>
<h3>立委職代名額增加　總數為八十四名　立法院例會激辯後通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕立院廿八日晨舉行三三〇次例會，以全部時間討論各種有關行憲之法規及立委職代名額分配表。今日會議由孫兼院長主席，出席立委八十餘人，首先討論者爲立委職代名額問題，經兩小時激辯後，決議將職代名額自五十六名增至八十四名。繼討論立委職代分配表，根據原表五十六名。職業團體所選出之立委中，農漁團體可得十八名，工業團體十二名，商業團體三名，工礦團體五名，敎育團體十一名，自由職業團體七名，現總數改爲八十四名，各業名額當將比例增加，惟鄧鴻業認漁業團體佔數太多，我國北方人士有終生米嘗過魚味者，此一規定恐又將爲滬津等地所謂漁業公司增加「魚目混珠，混水摸魚」機會。簡貫三氏亦指出，我人僅聞以農立國，以工建國，以漁建國之說，則未之聞也。北方老百姓米吃魚鮮幾千百年，漁業代表何能代表彼等發言？簡氏主張與其增加漁業代表，曷不若增加自由職業代表爲愈。張懷亦主增加自由職業代表名額，最後，決議重付審查。繼討論僑居國外人民立委選舉區之劃分，及每區應選出名額分配表，略加修正，即予通過。</p>
<p>國大職業團體名額分配表亦爲今日會中通過受案之一，根據規定國大職代共四五〇名，農漁國體佔百分之卅二，共一四四名，其中一三四名爲農業代表，十名爲漁業業代表，工人團體佔百分之廿八，共一二六名，工商團體百分之一七，商業團體百分之三，共十三名，工礦團體百分之四，共十八名，敎育團體百分之二十，九十名，自由職業團體百分之十三，五十九名，在上述四百五十名中，婦女代表又佔其七十二名，至其詳細分配辦法，則由社會部決定。</p>
<p>國民大會婦女團體代表名額分配表，會中亦曾討論，立委趙懋華，傳岩等咸起發言，彭醉士則以「並非女子」身份爲其本籍江西力爭，若干立委對各地。所成立之婦女團體表示懷疑。後決議該表再付審查。</p>
<p>僑胞國代及立委，候選人簽署人數，原規定失之過高，海外部要求予以減少，此案今日討論時，會中並無多大意見，後決將僑民立委簽署人數減爲五百人，立委簽署人數減爲兩百人。當時所有人提及政黨提名問題，孫兼院長指示、參加制憲黨派可以政黨提出，此外各黨派是否可提名，現尙未決定。</p>
<p>最後，又討論修正監委選罷法及增加立委西藏名額案等兩案，前者決議暫不修正，後者東付審查。會議至一時許始散，下次例會定七月三日舉行，該次會議或將爲立院本屆最後一次例會，所有積存要案，屆時可望全部肅淸</p>
<h3>僑外國民立委名額　立院決議爲十九名</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕立法院廿八日通過之僑居國外國民立法委員選舉區域之劃分，及每區應選出名額分配表如下：第一區美國（檀香山）二名，第二區加拿六一名，第三區中南美洲各國一名，第四區古巴及其他西印度羣島一名，第五區澳洲大溪地及附近各島與新幾內亞東部一名，第六區菲律賓一名，第七區日本。朝鮮。琉球及東太平洋各島一名，第八區香港，澳鬥一名，第九區越南一名，第十區緬甸，印度及亞洲西南各國一名，第十一區還羅二名，第十二區馬來亞及北婆羅洲二名，第十三區東印度羣島及西南婆羅洲，葡屬帝汶與新幾內亞西部二名，第十四區歐洲一名，第十五區非洲一名，總計十九名。</p>
<h3>魯境大戰序幕揭開</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿八日電〕沂蒙山區大戰序幕再度揭開，國車已取得絕對優勢主動地位。自廿六日起，由湯頭經蒙陰，新泰，萊蕪至膠濟綫龍山車站向東北作扇形攻擊之國軍，戰至廿八日止，全綫平均已推進廿五公里，東起沂水西南馬泉，安前，舊寨，坦埠經大張莊，柳樹頭（新泰東約三十公里）至萊蕪東廿餘公里之桃峪，盤龍山皆入國軍之手。膠濟綫正面之棗園寺，亦經國軍收復，前鋒又達明水附近。</p>
<h3>朝陽解圍</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿八日電〕朝陽解關，共軍向北退去，沿途大事破壞電訊設備。</p>
<h3>人民權利保障法　立院憲法委會重新草擬　待休會後首次會議討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕人民權利保障法草案，前經立院小組會作初步審查後，廿八日下午三時提交憲法規委會討論，以原案所包括者範圍似嫌不廣，當推定劉克　·呂復·陳顧遠·劉不同·王世憲等七人重新草擬，定休會以後之第一次會議提出討論。原案要點爲（一）對嫌疑犯不得隨便逮捕，應由司法警察先出傳票，如不到，則再出拘票。（二）逮捕後應於廿四小時內解法院。（三）如不解送法院，司法機關或本人及其親屬，可要求提審。（四）人民集會在未發生擾亂社會秩序事實以前，軍警機關不得將其解散及干涉其言論。（五）人民住宅無確實罪證前，不得入內搜查。（六）出版事業在出版以前不得檢查，非經法院判決，不得停刊或封閉。（七）除司法警察，（按指警察與憲兵）外，其他人員不可施行檢查逮捕行爲一，如有違犯，應負刑事責任。</p>
<h3>參會秘書處聲明</h3>
<p>合衆社報道欠準確</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕國民參政會邵秘書長力子，廿八日向中央社記者聲明：「關於廿七日本會駐會委會開會時之外交報告及質詢，合眾社日昨所發表之報導，與當時王部長世杰報告及答覆之言詞，內容頗有出入，秘書處負有責任，特托貴社代為聲明，以免誤會」。</p>
<h3>立院一場熱烈辯論　增加名額問題各抒主張</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕久懸未決之立委職代名額問題、今日再度於立院例會提出時，發生空前未有之激辯，二小時中全場八十餘立案，除絕少數外，紛起發言，一度幾陷僵局，賴孫兼院長兩度剴切說明，最後始決定，將一一二名减爲八十四名，然較原有之五十六名已增加一半。</p>
<p>此一爭執，由來已久，而最近之提出，則由於國務會議第五次會決議：「立委職業選舉名額增爲一一二名，交立院修正立委選罷法」而起。該案交憲法法規委會審查時，僉認立委總額已有七百餘人，若再增加，未免過多，決議「無庸修正」。劉委長克　於大會中說明審查經過後，激辯即隨之而起。</p>
<p>陳海澄氏提出「立法原則問題」，認立院不能作與國府原則相背之決定，更不可與國府居於對峙地位。</p>
<p>孫兼院長發言請立委勿堅持</p>
<p>反對增加職業代表最力之劉不同，不待陳氏言畢，則起反駁，指出國務會議所交議之原案，對不增加職業代表將有何種困難，未加說明，僅規定增爲一一二名，殊嫌空洞。</p>
<p>至此孫兼院長以國府委員資格，對劉氏說法予以駁斥，指出國民政府爲立法院之母體，在原則上對癢癢院有絕對拘束力，立院對國務會議交議之原則作「無庸修正」之決定，有違體制，實屬非法違法，有人將認立法院造了反。在法言法，目前之立院並非行憲時期之立法院，當不能自居於至高無上之地位，盼各立委對該案能重新加以考慮，如有意見儘可提出，而斷不可將其否決。</p>
<p>另一反對增加職業代表名額之健將周一志起立發言，提出兩項建議：（一）立院殊不必為此事，而代他人為後世百年負責，國府既願增加立委職代名額，此案可請國府自行決定，愛多少即選多少。（二）由立院陳述歷次開會反對增加職業代表名額之經過，並說明歷來所以反對之理由，請國府根據此類理由，再予明確指示。　譚惕吾指出國府旣高於一切，則應不獨高於立法院，且應同時高於全國。國家何以不重視立法院之意見，而僅注意若干職團？更不應爲滿足一部份人之需要而忽視立法尊嚴，若必　出諸强迫手段，則國府儘可一意孤行，國府此次舉措，實不能不認爲欠缺考慮。呂復重申其向來之一貫主張，對增加名額堅決反對，並根據憲法，說明人民在法庭前，選舉上，完全平等。全國僅有職業團體會員八百多人，根據立院所規定之五十六名，其比例已較區域代表便宜多多，若再將其增至一一二人，其不合理，不公允，當更甚於此，實爲世界任何國家所罕見。</p>
<p>平日絕少發言之少數黨立委王師曾今亦起立發言，王氏首先指出，職業團將爲爭取立委名額，利誘威脅無所不用其極，此會施之於立法院，亦曾施之於國民政府，長此以往，整個國家政策豈不亦將為其所左右？</p>
<p>贊成增加職代名額之　桐孫，舉出制度，組織，階層三點，希望勿過於堅持，討論至此，前後已近兩小時，而各立委猶多起發言，以當時情勢推測，再討論數日仍不致有何具體決定。孫兼院長乃再度起立發言，以挽回僵局。孫先指出此一間題，雖一再延宕，然國務會議當時討論此案時，老實不客氣說多數府委對此實不甚重視，其所以規定爲一一二名者，亦僅係根據五十六名增加一倍而決定，其初意本在協助立院解決此一問題。同人反對增加職代名額，主要理由爲深恐上海財閥操縱，惟根據立委職代分配表，五十六名代表，商業團體僅得三名，工礦團體亦僅五名，即令增加一倍，其數日亦僅爲六名與十名，所佔比例極微，我人應注意將來產生之代一是否爲各該業真正從業　，其他似無須過慮。</p>
<p>最後實行表決以大多數通過</p>
<p>孫氏言事，全體熱烈鼓掌，繼即進行表決，以最大多數予以通過。決定將立委職代名額自五十六人增至八十四人。</p>

<p>〔本市訊〕中國紡織學會以麥帥偏護日本紡織工業，不允列入賠償拆遷之列，且復多方迴護遂使日本紡織業駸駸復興，實爲使日本再起地步，前經該會會員大會一致決議，向麥帥提出抗議，茲錄此項抗議書如下：</p>
<p>聯合國賠償委員會遠東委員會中國代表團轉麥帥勛鑒：閣下統率三軍，征服强敵，豐功偉績，舉世同欽。現日本國內一切政治。軍事。經濟。敎育。等方針，均唯閣下之命是聽，中國人民方以為閣下目擊侵略者兇暴之狀，定能擘劃周詳，使侵略者永遠屈服，無法再起；誰知消息傳來，閣下對日本措置，寬大逾份，而以對日本紡織業之曲予廻護為尤甚。閣下以爲日本紡織工業，非軍需工業可比，不能列作賠償，而對日本現有紡錠二百八十餘萬枚，尙感不足，擬令其擴充至六百萬枚，非唯將用此維持其本國衣被之需，且將鼓勵出口，以爭取國際貿易市塲。因此，對中國政府要求減少日本紡織工業之意見，置之不理，本會爲中國人民團體，且為紡織工業之從業人員所組織，與日本之接觸旣多，對紡織工業之認識更切對實下之上述措置，認爲足以咸脅中國——美國之友邦——之生存，與助長日本——美國之敵人——未來之侵略，不得不提起閣下之警覺性，爰申述其理由如下：（一）日本全國人口七千萬，以每人每年棉布二十碼計，至多有紗錠一百卅萬至一百五十萬枚，可以供給有餘，日本現有紡錠已超越自行供給需要限量，若謂須賴棉貨輸出換取食糧及其他必需物品，其然豈其然乎？査日本年產蠶絲茶葉等甚豐，輸出數量均巨，儘可利用以爲調劑之物，固無需乎紡機所製棉貨也：（二）日本爲此次大戰之禍首，其敢於率性横行，自恃其軍備之足耳，而軍備之基礎，在於工業，但日本工業之所以發達，更得力於紡織工業，戰前廉價日貨紡織品之推銷，不但廣被於東亞南洋，且遠及於西歐南美，其汹湧之勢，迄今思之，猶有餘悸，而日人人則以其盈餘建設軍事工業，故欲削弱日本之軍事準備力量，必須削弱其所賴之經濟源泉，而限制其紡織工業，超過所需限量之設備，正不失爲最佳辦法之一。（三）欲阻止日本再起侵略，必賴有鄰邦監視，盟國對日本之管制，勢不能無限期延長，中國與日本爲近鄰，對於日本動止，可隨時監督，况日本之再起，首蒙不利者爲中國中國對其一切舉措自將格外關心，（四）此次大戰，發動於日本，首當其衝者即爲中國，總計抗戰八年，犧牲慘重，舉凡衣食住行之所需，自當積極補充，以拯斯民於水火，拆遷日本過剩之紡織工業設備於中國，實爲適當而公平之舉。（五）紡織工業在平時固爲民需工業，但在戰時即一變而軍需工業，試思數百萬軍隊，若無衣被配備，將如何實行作戰？至於直接供給軍用者，如船車之篷，飛機之翼，降落之傘，以及醫療傷兵用之綳帶紗布，幾無一非紡織之產品，拆遷其民用最低限度以上之紡織設備，實爲剝奪其軍備潛力之有力措置，又復何疑？以上所述，不過其犖犖大者，其他理由尙多，不遑一一枚舉，同人等爲東亞永久和平計，爲太平洋永久太平計，心所謂危，不敢不掬誠奉吿，倘蒙采及芻莞，及時改正，尙未爲遲云。</p>

<h3>美國對華新決策的開始</h3>
<p>美國務院於廿七日宣佈，美國政府業與中國政府簽訂合同，准許中國購買價値六十五萬美元之美國剩餘軍火；同時美國進出口銀行總裁馬丁仍在考慮以新貸款界予中國，並將貸款性質分爲四種：（一）促進美國進出口貿易之貸款；（二）補助及鼓勵私人資本而不與其競爭之貸款，（三）具有特殊目的之貸款；（四）董事會決定之貸款。這兩項消息傳至中國，將中美兩國間這些天來所有似乎足以引起爭辯的因素，一掃而空。</p>
<p>上述的一批剩餘軍火，雖在戰時即租借於中國者，但在此際售予中國，不問其數量有多少，其含義之重大，不言可知。美國合衆社記者夏克福電稱：美國以剩餘軍火售予中國，實可視爲美國放棄其自馬歇爾元帥於一九四五年赴華調解國共衝突十八個月來所採取之中立政策。至關於貸款問題，美國進出口銀行儲款以待的五億美元貸款，至本月卅日，大抵不再延期，固不免使中國人民失望，但美國表示並非不再在經濟上援助中國，而且正相反的，美國經濟援華計劃，不久即可實施，不論是促進中國經濟復興的長期借款，或是穩定中國目前經濟局勢的短期借款，只要中國政府提出「特殊計劃」及「保證債還」，美國都有畀予中國的可能。</p>
<p>近幾天來，本報先後發表三四篇社論，一再聲明我們的信念，美國如有遠見的政治家，他們對於危機日著的遠東局勢，必能有新的決策。我們看到了上述兩項自華府傳來的消息，使我們更加相信：美國不乏具有遠見的政治家，而美國對華也已開始作新的決策了。</p>
<p>普通兩國的邦交，一半取決於利害關係，另一半則取決於歷史關係。從遠處看，美國一直是我國的友邦，兩國關係非常友好而密切。美國對於中國，沒有領土和政治的野心，並曾運用「門戶開放」和「機會均等」的原則，維護中國領土與主權的完整，這是人人所早知的。在抗戰期，美國不僅在精神上同情我國的艱苦作戰，而且在物質上源源不絕的援助中國。到了太平洋戰爭爆發，中美更成了共患難的盟國。勝利以後，美國特派馬帥來華，調處中共問題，雖不免觀察未盡中肯，而其一片爲中國求和平求統一的至誠，實在令我們感動。所以從中美兩國邦交發展的過程看來，美國的對華政策，是始終一貫的，就是希望遠東有一個和平綁一民主强大的新中國，爲世界和平的安定力而已。</p>
<p>馬帥離華返國時所發表的臨別贈言，至今還深還的印在全中國人民的心底。可惜馬帥的一番好意，終爲共產黨的横梗執抝，未能完全如國人的願望，化干戈而爲玉帛。此在馬帥對於中國政府處境的困難，諒也非常明瞭，而且十分同情的。論理，在中美之間，根本就不會有什麼誤會或錯覺之類發生，而誰放棄了誰，或美國將否退出遠東這些類似的爭議更是不必要的言詞。時至今日，陰霾遲早必爲陽光所驅散。</p>
<p>所以，我們以爲中美關係是有其歷史的因緣，美國對華必能有適應時代需要的新決策。但我們所當着力的，必須中國自己有一個民主而强有力的政府，決定了人民所需要的政策，而在人民支持之下，不顧一切的毅然實行，使中國在國民政府之下，眞正成爲一個民族獨立，民權發展，民生康樂的國家，則任何友邦的援助均將源源而　，豈獨美國？「天助自助者！」我們於美國採行新決策的今日，格外要自奮自强。</p>
<h3>世界分合的一大關鍵</h3>
<p>英法蘇三國外畏已於廿七日在法國外交部，舉行第一次會議，討論美國國務卿馬歇爾針孔帥所提出之經濟援助歐洲計劃。會議情形，雖嚴守秘密，但據一般觀察家談稱，會塲空氣，充滿了和諧合作的精神，預料三國外長對於復興歐洲，必能商就一項計劃。全世界人士，必都非常重視這次會議，因爲世界今後的分合，可從這次會議的結果中窺其朕兆。</p>
<p>自從上次莫斯科四國外長會議不歡而散，給世人的印像實在太壞，幾乎使大家感覺到眞正和平離開我們將更遼遠。其後，在美國方面，旣有杜魯門主義的宣佈，不惜以鉅款貸與受有外來成脅的希土兩國；在蘇聯方面，則對巴爾幹的用心益亟，乃造成匈牙利的政變，並使保加利亞與羅馬尼亞也陷於風雨飄搖之中。無論從那一個角度去觀察，美蘇雨國關係，確令人們感到逐漸緊張。這種局勢，如果不設法挽救，不僅歐洲各國將陷於可悲的厄運，而且人類的浩刦也恐不可避免。馬歇兩國務卿有鑒於斯，乃爲世界和平與人類幸福，作最後的呼籲。馬帥於本月五日在哈佛大學發表演說，提出美國經濟援助歐洲之計劃，大意略謂。「歐洲各國應團結一致，共同進行大規模之復興工作，美國當將盡其所能，予以協助」；又謂：「在今後的三四年內，歐洲必須獲得更多之援助，否則將引起政治的經濟的崩潰，故美國必須盡其力量，促使歐洲經濟復興，經濟不復興，政治無法安定，政治不安定，即無和平可言。」</p>
<p>馬歇爾元帥這一篇援歐演說，立即引起歐洲各國人士的衝動與興奮，大家認爲莫斯科四國外長會議之一後的歐洲陰霾，或可從這裏透露出一綫陽光。尤其是馬帥將蘇聯亦列入美國援助歐洲計劃的範圍以內，更使打開歐洲的僵局，增添了一個新的因素。</p>
<p>英法當局於馬帥發表演說之後，跟着決定，以英法外長的名義，邀請蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，前往巴黎舉行會議，共商美國的援歐計劃。當初蘇聯政府雖保持緘默，輿論且有指斥馬帥企圖利用其美元以干涉他國的內政，好像　　不願參加會商。但是，馬帥的援歐計劃，究竟是不可厚非的，美國共和黨總統候選人史泰森也贊成美國在今後十年之內，應以大量援助界予歐洲戰災各國，英國前外相艾登更稱譽馬帥之援歐計劃，實爲美國的最大賜與，足使歐洲以及全世界發生新的希望。而其他歐陸各國朝野也無不一致願意通力合作，以促此計劃之實施。蘇聯因爲看到歐洲各國的反應如此，也就終於在廿三日發表公報，接受英法外長的邀請，參加三國外長會議，並建議即於廿七日在巴黎舉行，討論馬帥的援歐計劃。</p>
<p>蘇聯這一個重大的宣佈，使英法及東歐各國無不表示欣慰。雖不能即此認爲三國外長會議必有所成就，但無論如何，蘇聯與西方各國合作共同復興歐洲的可能性，終是增加了。此不但爲歐洲慶，且可爲全世界慶。而愛好和平的中國人民，必更寄以重大的期望。只要當代政治家，外交家，能運用其政治知　，從遠處看，由大處想，消除國際間的猜忌與誤會，盡量恢復戰時盟國同患難的精神，以戰時爭取勝利的毅力來締造世界和平，則今日的世界局勢當即可以改觀。所以我們認爲這次三國外長會議，所討論的雖爲美國援歐計劃，而實在是世界分合的一大關鍵。</p>
<p>據各國通訊社的報道，英美法蘇四强，對於援歐計劃各有算盤，主張也不盡相同。例如美國先要歐洲各國對於其基本需要獲致協議，並定一適當的基礎，然後始可向美國申請援助；英國深恐蘇聯要求美國援助過多，故主張德境英美佔領區應享有優先權，而此項主張，則爲蘇法所不能同意；其在蘇聯，則主張歐洲各國之因受德國侵略而造成目下經濟困難者，應先取得美國援助。這些意見的紛歧，固足以妨害三國外長會議的進行，但只要三國外長能虛心商討，不存偏見，能將個別利益置於聲個隊洲的利益之下，爲復興歐洲擬就一個切實易行的方案，那末這些紛歧的意見，當不難煥然氷釋。我中國雖非歐洲之一員，但和平是不可分割的，故對於世界今後分合所繫的馬帥援歐計劃，其希望成就的心理，也不下於歐洲任何國家。</p>

<h3>希臘三鄰國侵略行動　美代表嚴辭譴責　建議設委會駐邊疆監視</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿七日電〕美代表奧斯汀於安理會開始討論巴爾幹調査委員圍之報吿書時，提出警吿，表示若希臘之北鄰繼績侵犯希臘之疆界，則安理會將不得不採用「執行措施」（根據聯合國憲單，執行措施包括自經濟封鎖以　武力干涉之各種措施），奧斯汀並建　設立聯合國永久委員會監視希臘之北疆。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿七日電〕聯合國安理會美代表奧斯汀，廿七日在該會會議中宣稱，如果反對希臘獨立之行動繼續存在，則世界和平將遭受更嚴重之咸脅。保加利亞，阿爾巴尼亞，及南斯拉夫等國之協助游擊隊作戰，無異正規軍之實際侵略。巴爾幹之游擊戰已成為聯合國組織下最嚴重案件之一，聯合國之前途端視如何解決此案而定。安班會應立刻接受巴爾幹調査委會之一切建議，包括前美國所提之組織巴爾幹邊境委會，以巡査該處時有糾紛之東南歐滬境。奧斯汀並正式建議該委會由安理會之十一個委員國組織之，其第一屆任務應迄於一九四九年八月。</p>
<p>在奧斯汀演說後，鄧特拉密斯立即加以支持，並稱，欲將希腦自共黨獨裁下拯救出來，有採取迅速行動之必要。在此次安理會開會時，南，保，阿等三國以及希臘亦均被邀列席，保加利亞與阿爾巴尼亞代表對希臘之指斥，均矢口否認。保代表稱，該國從未調練一名游擊隊。此案可能需有數星期之辯論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿八日電〕美蘇兩國在聯合國安理會中避免權牌已久，現因巴爾幹問題恐將成爲事實。美首席代表　斯汀昨日指斥南，阿，保三國違反聯合國憲章一部份基本原則後，大多數代表今日認爲首要問題，厥在蘇聯是否將支持其衛星國，而當設立調査團常駐巴爾幹注視局勢，爲期二年一案提付表決時，定當引起危機。南斯拉夫等三國均表示不願准許聯合國調査國自由出入其國境。</p>
<h3>三外長舉行第二次會議商復興歐洲原則　會議經過徇英方之請嚴守秘密</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：三國外長今日下午三時起在法外交部舉行第二次會議。新聞封鎖雖極嚴密，但「巴黎人」報謂莫洛托夫有極縝密之提議，在首次外長會議中已曾討論及之。據可靠方面稱：三國外長竭力把握經濟復興之基本原則，皮杜爾提議除西班牙外，凡參加戰爭之聯合國，中立國或前敵性國，均應列於復興計劃範圍以內。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：皮杜爾在三國外長會議首次會議中稱，接受馬歇爾計劃應從遠進行，並建議以九月一日爲歐洲復興計劃籌備期限。莫洛托夫反對章從事，主張馬歇兩計劃應詳細硏討，並健先解決德國未來及蘇聯賠償等問題。但據塔斯社電訊：莫洛托夫建議應向美國取得時種保證，作爲會議之第一步驟。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕英蘇法三國外長會議雖嚴守秘密，但據可靠方面消息，三國外長本日下午四時開始舉行第一次會議後，曾立即着手討論馬歇爾之援歐計劃。本日會議始於午後四時‘由法國外長皮杜爾主席，聞會塲空氣頗爲認眞。據消息變通人士稱：三國外長可能已將美國建議所引起之各項微妙問題，加以討論。法國外長皮社爾偕同外次繆維爾，外交部經濟司司長亞爾芳，曁法國四年復興計劃之起草人蒙納首先到會。移時英國外相偕英國駐法大使特夫古柏，狄克遜霍爾巴契爵士　華萊趕到。莫洛托夫外長蒞臨最遲，隨行者有蘇聯駐法大使鮑哥莫洛夫，專家四人及英語法語譯員各一。三國外長會議於八時十分散會，事後並禾發表聲明。衆信三國外長將於明日午後再行會議。莫洛托夫外長於八時零四分首先退席，貝文外相則於八時十五分偕特夫古柏大使及顧問離開法國外交部。三一國外長因會議嚴守秘密，故原定七時舉行之記者招待會，亦已臨時取消，今晚恐亦未必發表任何聲明。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕據悉：會談嚴守秘密，係貝文所提出，事實上法國且曾表示反對。法國原定於昨夜舉行記者招待會，至三國外長會談約一小時後，始予撤銷。法國對於貝文之提議，甚感驚異，故法國是否願在會議期間始終保守秘密，尙屬議疑。蘇聯代表團之態度尙不可知。但自蘇代表抵法國外交部參加會議以迄散會後退出會塲時爲止，未曾在會議室外發表一言，正與英代表團之態度相反。且蘇代表團各人面部一無表情，亦無絲毫笑容，絕對無法揣測其愉快與否。外界對於此次會議經過祇能從事猜測。若三國外長始終嚴守秘密，須待會議結束後始行宣佈，則會議結果，須至星期二始分曉。</p>
<h3>蘇報對馬卿計劃語調較前稍緩和</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿七日電〕「新時代」週刊本日刊載社論一篇，係蘇聯最近對於馬歇爾計劃最表樂觀之反響，內容略稱：如果馬歇爾計劃乃恢復商業之軍要經濟措置，而無補充杜魯門主義之用意，則所有歐洲國家勢必加以擁護「無疑」。歐洲任何民主國家當然不能接受如杜魯門主義迫令土希爾國所接受之貸款條件，此舉豈可稱爲眞正經濟援助。鑒於西方集團擁護者顯擬接受馬歇爾計劃，故目前尙難判斷該計劃在未來成就中可達到何種程度。馬歇爾在哈佛大學槪述該計劃之原文興英外相貝交在下院內之解釋，意義殊爲　糊云。</p>
<h3>美國要求蘇聯付出重大代價</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓廿八日電〕據權威方面意見，蘇聯如參與歐洲復興計劃，必須拉開東歐之經淸「　幕」，而容許東歐國家與西歐恢復正常商業關係，此點或爲美國爲參興包括蘇聯及其東歐衛星國家之任何援助計劃而要求之主要「代價」，美國若干官員承認蘇聯城付之北一代價相當鉅六，或過於鉅大云。</p>
<h3>克萊頓啟程赴法　列席三外長會議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕美副國務卿克萊噸已於今晨十一時十五分自倫敦啓程赴巴黎，列席三國外長會首議次會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿七日電〕英外交部發言人廿七日否認：美副國務卿克萊頓已與英國閣員獲致協議，在聯合國範圍外實施馬歇爾援歐計劃。渠又拒絕說明在外相貝文動身赴巴黎前，美英談判中是否已獲致協議。克業頓現尙在倫敦，定週末赴歐洲大陸，美大使館稱：渠尙未獲悉克萊頓何時動身，或赴何處。克萊頓本人仍拒絕接見新聞記者。</p>
<h3>史泰遜主張　美參加巴黎會議</h3>
<p>並建議停止以物品運蘇</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕有望爲共和黨下屆總統候選人之史泰遜，昨日廣播，主張由美國參加巴黎會議，並停止以油類及物品運往蘇聯。史氏謂：「吾人應立即參加巴黎會議，使我國與英國得在魯爾區一致行動，以復活該區之貧病居民」。史氏主張停止以工業品運蘇，係因蘇聯一再違反雅爾達協定之故。渠記爲至少在美國得有肯定之外交政策以前，應停止以油類及工業物品運蘇。</p>
<h3>國會要求馬歇爾解釋　美援助歐洲計劃　尤重視該計劃可能引起之貸款</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕國會今日宣稱擬請馬歇爾國務鄉詳細釋明其援歐計劃，以及該一計劃可能引起之貸款數額。按杜魯門總統已於昨日表示完全贊成馬歇爾之計劃。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕參議院金融委員會主席即共和黨參議員柯洛拉杜本日宣稱：本會業已要求國務卿馬歇兩元帥詐細報吿美國政府所負有之國際義務，同時本會並已要求馬帥詳細報吿外國請求美政府予以金融援助之詳情云。</p>
<h3>艾帥發表談話</h3>
<p>謂美有徼募士兵必要</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕艾森豪威元帥今日重申美國需要徵兵與加緊志願兵徵募。據稱，此乃時局使然，亦爲美國應付其國際義務所必要。艾帥復稱，渠辭去陸軍參謀總長一職後，並無政治野心，並拒絕暗示何人將繼其後任。</p>
<h3>美國務院整肅運動</h3>
<p>不忠官員多人免職</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿八日電〕國務院發言人昨夜透露：目前任國務卿貝爾納斯設立特別整爾委員會後，國務院官員至少已有十人因牽涉共產嫌疑或疏忽之罪而遭免職。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林廿七日電〕德境蘇聯區五邦之總理，及中央區政部之貿易供應燃料電力速輸農業等部部長，今日在蘇聯軍政府總部內舉行秘密會議。據接近德蘇官方之人士透露，討論主題為審查及整頓蘇聯區內經濟及供應組織之問題。兩星期前蘇方曾宣布設立七人經濟委會，蓋在蘇聯區內，邦政府及中央區政府任務往往有重疊之弊。蘇軍政府前此業已敦促德人設法改良此項局勢，但蘇軍政府復表示在全德之中央政府已有可能性以前，毋需採取最後之決議。</p>
<h3>日人帛琉島採礦　英將提抗議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二十七日電〕關於麥帥決定准許日人在太平洋帛琉羣島開採琉瑛礦產，此間官方人士聞悉之餘，深為詫異。據負責人士談稱：英國政府尙未接獲正式報告，惟此一消息如獲官方證實，則英國將步澳洲之後塵，向美國提出抗議。按澳洲業已宣佈將提出抗議。</p>
<p>〔路透社東京廿八日電〕麥帥總部發言人，今日釋明准許日本在帛琉羣島之安加島採磷之事稱，安加島採磷工作之進行，已逾一年，俾使日本得獲肥料，以增產糧食，並因此减少美國對於日本繼荒所担任之負担。此一工作，最初係經華盛頓國際聯合糧食局批准，卒與美國某公司訂立合回，由其在該島採礦。迨其經費用幣後，華盛頓遂令麥帥接管此一工作，僱用日本工人，由日人負担經費採磷，以供佔領日本之用。查安加島係由美軍所攻佔，現在美國控制之下，故美國自有優先利用該島資源，以應付佔領日本之需要之權。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕在此巴黎三國會議舉行之際，杜魯門總統已予以保證，美國高級官員對於進行歐瀕復興一項工作，意見表示一致。據此間官方人士稱：（一）關於歐洲之需要，何者可以自給，何者需要美國之接濟，現尙無藍本可以查照；（二）巴黎會議倘能獲致協議，美國官員深望英法蘇三國能在本年夏季即行提出歐洲全面計劃之詳細基礎；（三）倘屆時能擬定此項計劃，美國當縝密加以研究，並由總統最近所設立之三個委負會，就美國之援助能力，決定所能担負之任務。</p>
<p>美國官員且同意不同所擬定之計劃為何，美國必需在今後三四年內，繼續以金錢注入歐洲，否則將使歐洲情形益形混亂及使國內發生可能之劇烈倒退，但錢財之權操在國會手中，故任何諾言均須視國會之撥款而定。</p>
<p>〔路透社一華盛頓廿七日電〕美國政府對英法蘇三國外長在巴黎舉行之會“議雖不表示十分樂觀，但仍予以密切注意。歐洲領袖所討論之最主要問題之一，即東半球國家對美元集團國家貿易之鉅額入超，已因美國統計局所發表之五月份數字而益顯其嚴重。美國是月之出口額，已樹立最高記錄，而自亟需美元之國輸入美國之貨物，反减少約三千八百萬元以上。美國於是月輸往國外之救濟復興物資，價値十億〇三千九百六十萬元，較租借援助最緊張時期之數額為尤大，而輸入美國之總額，僅四億七千三百六十萬元，較上月猶少三一千八百二十萬元，此項不平衡之狀態，使歐洲在數月以內有面臨飢饉之威脅，而馬歇爾計劃目的即在治療此種病態。馬歇爾旣已表示「此乃歐洲之事務，吾人未便干涉」，故巴黎會議中美國並不派觀察員列席，然美國對此次會議極為重視。某一美國高級官員今日曾謂：此次會談，或將再如戰後所已舉行之其他會談，但使其成為歐洲史上之轉捩點，亦未始不可能云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電」此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：美國雖未參加巴黎三國外長會議，但可能提出若干建議，此種建議將與確保歐洲復興所當採取適一當措施之槪念相符。同時美國外交界人士為欲避免任何足以影響三國外畏會商之批評起見，均保持謹愼之保留態度。美國政界人士觀於歐洲各國間之現行關係，認為下列各項條件，乃為實施美國援歐計劃所必需具備者：（一）廢一除優惠之關稅壁壘；（二）使各種商務協定具有多國性質；（三）以平等之基礎待遇各國；（四）在歐洲內河永道尤其是多瑙河自由航行之權；（五）實現德國之經濟統一；（六）批准並簽署和平條約；（七）均分歐陸之資源。</p>

<h3>勗進補習學校參觀記</h3>
<p>— 知生</p>
<p>上海學校雖多，但是辦理得十分完善的却很少，這在補習學校方面，可說尤其難得饜衆望。　筆者日前往林森中路成都路口，參觀上海市私立勗進補習學校，承校方主持人對該校施敎方針，詳細陳述，筆者彷彿發現了新境界。除欽佩該校主持人爲敎育而敎育的精神難能可貴外，筆者覺得該校對投考升學靑年扶助的週到與熱情，大有介紹之必要。</p>
<p>該校剏設已近一年，專以指導靑年學生複習中小學學程，投考各大中學爲宗旨。設有大學先修班，髙中進修班，初中預修班。現在擴大招生，已有學生八百名。最近校董會中，經董事長瀋公展，董事陳保泰蔣建白等議決，增聘笑玉書等爲董事，並審募基金，擴展校務。該校在本年暑假期間增設升學指導班四班，籌劃外埠函授班招生，業已呈准敎育局立案。　敎師大半是交通大學同學之富有敎學經騐者，敎授認眞、尤以理工各科，更獲好評。自初一至髙三各科俱全，完全採取學生分別選修制，可以任意選讀，且依照敎育局規定，不收學費，祇收少許雜費，這在上海的私立補習學校中，可說是鳳毛麟角，不容易找到吧。</p>
<p>各校的畢業生，往往在學期結束之後，視升學爲第一件頭痛的事，從選擇學校起到報名投考入學註册止，不知要經過多少奔波周章，尙且不能有如願以償的把握。爲了這點，該校便於署假中開設升學指導班，上課五週，一面結束學業，一面銜接升學考試。敎程內容，大都爲各科精要，各校考題，分類編纂而成。若能完全領會，則升學絕非難事。同時爲了使各校學生能廣泛地受到輔導起見，雜實僅收二萬餘元一科，學額亦增至六百名。</p>
<p>現在各升學指導班之確能做到指導兩字，恐怕祗有勗進了。因爲除了在經常複習授課以外，更有升學輔導計劃的實施。那洋洋數千言的計劃書，確可稱得完善無遺，而且仍在徵求同學建議與改進之中。依這篇計劃，有幾條實施綱領，很値得我們稱許：</p>
<p>（一）收集各校歷屆試題，以一般學校之敎材爲參考，分類編纂成一完美之講義，祗供應本校學生，由各班敎師詳述各校命題之方式及傳統之習慣及應考之態度。</p>
<p>（二）由於時間之侷促，上課時不得詢問該節以外之一切問題，而另聘導師每日常駐特闢之辦公室內解答任何同學之質詢，不論是敎材內的或是敎材外的。或者可以將問題投入「釋疑」箱內，由各導師分別解答。</p>
<p>（三）特聘各導師在辦公室內講解各校一切報名投去註册入學情形，而且逐日有各校招生情形日期詳細公佈，以免各同學往返奔波。分心學業。</p>
<p>（四）由升學補導委員會，代各同學集體辦理報名投考以至註册入學手續，而應考時更由校方與各該校考生服務團取得連緊，率同前往，以免臨時張皇，耽誤考試。</p>
<p>（五）如遇各校招考　時期，即在各校設臨時聯絡站，以便該校同學憇息或詢問。　從這篇綱領看來，該校爲扶助靑年學生升學，可說無微不至，就是這一點，已够表現出忠實而偉大的服務精神了。</p>

<p>今晚八時起，仍在原處舉行總決第三戰，由三部冠軍華聯會戰亞軍郵乙。前者曾於三部決賽中奪得勝利，今晚狹路重逢，分外眼紅，郵乙今日必以全副精神，聞報一箭之仇。裁判邵義元方國賢，紀錄陳祖國，茲錄前晚結果及今晚出塲名單錄後：</p>

<h3>永紗漲勢受阻　小型股大活躍</h3>
<p>華股昨過程十分恍惚，永紗因假期過久久，貼息仍須三角九至四角三分半，且假後適値掉期，多頭負担不起，大戶亦已動搖，終告盤低，一般人心以五成現金保證，所方迄無通告，且聞經紀人代表尙須晉京，尙存樂觀希望，中途屢起屢仆，起伏殊速。小型，次熱若美亞新光等，十分俏利，不跌反漲。雜牌股若水泥榮豐且漲達限度，良以新光美亞有人乘靑，水泥榮豐均將增資也。</p>
<p>晨初以報載美以軍火貸我，人心尙好，除永紗平疲外，餘股一致開高，尤以新光開高更多。遞永紗開後，一四八號一四二號一一二號進至九四五〇元，一五五號一六〇號三六號一五七號一四二號一六三號賣到九二三〇元，一四八號三五號二二三號六九號一五二號二一三號來進，一四二號三二號出後忽進，而升爲九五〇〇元。二三五號一七一號尙賣而稍掙扎，二二四號一八六號一四三號一〇三號二一八號來進，一五九號三二號並進現永紗，而回漲到九六〇〇元。二三五號一八五號一五七號一五五號一七四號三六號八號二二四號七六號三二號均售，十時後低至九二七〇元。一二五號二三二號七六號一五五號俱進，一〇四號並進現永紗，人心仍易回振，美亞現交由二二三號首光掛漲停，遞美亞由二〇二號一五七號一九七號二三二號等買進，亦迫限度，新光由二〇四號一五四號力進，扶搖直上，景福亦由二〇四號吸收，亦步亦趨，遞永紗再升至九五〇〇元外。六五號八號三六號二二四號一四〇號趁勢賣出，而退至九三〇〇元。一九〇號七八號一二號尙進，一八號一〇四號來購現永紗，升爲九四五〇元。二三五號不時脫售現遞永紗，漲勢遭阻，一八五號並售現永紗，一三〇號一二號八三號二二四號以及散多减售，跌至九二〇〇元。十一時四十分，二三一號一一二號一四號最後一次將遞永紗拉高至九四〇〇元外，一五七號二三五號二二四號一〇四號二一三號一〇〇號一四八號斬多，一八五號二一七號並斬售現永紗，水泥雖由二二〇號，榮豐雖由八三號，雙雙漲停，但以存多搖動，午刻遞永紗步降至九〇六〇元。即交亦　八七五〇元低價。一一二號一六〇號二〇二號二三五號二二四號一八六號二一三號來進，臨收尙易拉高。現美亞復迫漲限，午收以九一七〇元結束。收後二一三號一五二號等均進，復喊高至九三〇〇元光景。結果較前收計現交各股永紗華豐微升，新業永公平平，信和勤興景福新光中法各漲半成强至一成弱不等，美亞漲達限度，榮豐漲停後有回，軋升半成强，水泥漲停，中紡麗安新華平平，大通火柴景綸內衣微挫，中絲統益各升半成左右，餘股微升。遞交計美亞漲停後有回，軋升成半弱，信和新光升半成弱，勤興平平，景福漲一成不到，華豐微升，永紗永公微降，塲外各老股計世界跌半成，餘均平疲。</p>

<p>外股昨轉趨恍惚，怡紗起仆尙微，各股榮辱不一。晨開八八〇〇〇元，低價八七〇〇〇元，高價八九〇〇〇元，而以八八〇〇〇元結束。廣帮有供，證券帮則進，港申電微升爲十元〇八。但本市金價暗市低後有回，過程尙屬盤旋，較前收計會德豐業廣漲起半成，英聯微升，鋼業航業微挫，餘股均尙平定。</p>

<p>嗶嘰市况，近除雪白色落令，人造棉下檔無人間津外，餘均趨堅軋俏。毋諭中厚及薄素青草綠顏色，流通皆缺。因全滬存底有限，廠方生產遠較其他呢絨爲少。美國與香港運申，因環境關係，相率絕跡。查嗶嘰進出交易，圓利遠較花呢類爲硬薄，以致行廠號方產售均無幾。昨薄素嗶監因美國貨無進口，尤爲俏缺，致其售價已與中厚相埒。</p>
<h3>募銷成績良佳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美金依券近日行銷數額日見遞增，昨日短期庫券共銷美金七九〇，五二〇元，內中信局經銷五九二，六七〇元，新華銀行八五〇〇〇元，中國銀行三九三五〇元，中國國貨銀行二萬元，金城銀行一二四五〇元。</p>

<h3>文獻名邦　餘姚全貌</h3>
<p>— 杭州廿五日訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>餘姚，不但在浙東是一個名縣，就全國說來，在歷史上，在實業上，是一個重要的地方。在精神上，它培育了至陽明·黄黎洲·朱舜水·嚴子陵諸先　，予國人和異邦提供了髙風名學。在物質上，它供應了衣食所必需的鹽·棉·茶，但是，抗戰期中，餘姚淪陷了四年半，敵人佔據了縣城，樹立了勞乃心的傀儡政權，「新四軍」三五支隊以梁弄為中心，盤據了四明山及其附近地區，把餘姚劃分做二個縣，姚北的餘姚縣和姚南的南山縣，（前者由　　主政，後者兩張之光主政）。眞正的縣政府，則以倪永强　首，潛伏在地下，在山區打游擊。因此，總計不過二百廿餘萬畝的土地上，有了四個縣長。餘姚雖然後淪陷了四年半，但是她底損失，却比別的地方來得慘重。四明山裏，至今還潛伏着殘除的匪部，隨時覬覦着看機會來擾亂地方。記者爲了明隊這個多難的「文獻名邦」，特地通過蕭紹公路去訪問了一次。</p>
<p>元氣損耗過鉅十年始克恢復</p>
<p>據現任縣長詹世騮對記者說：「奸匪不僅在軍事，政治上割據地盤，自立政權，而且還發行了大量的「抗幣」，以一對四〇的比例，收糶法幣，强迫使用，實施其經濟的掠奪和剝削，直到現在，還有好些留在民間，老百姓祇好對這些無用的廢紙從然嘆氣。」他停了一下，皺皺周說：「這些年來，餘姚的元氣傷耗得本大，至少要有十年才能恢復得過來。」</p>
<p>茶棉稻鹽近況重心不在縣城</p>
<p>餘姚北濱杭州灣，南靠四明山，在地形上是一把摺扇的樣子，在地質上則如梯形。南端是山區，產茶；稍北爲平原，是稻區；再北爲棉區；濱海一帶；則爲鹽區。全縣可耕地（包括田·地·山·蕩）共達八三三·一七三畝，但因不能全部種稻，所以年產僅一四九萬担，不敷全縣之需。幸在姚北一帶，利用地方，棉麥並種，每年也可收麥卅萬担，雜糧廿六萬五千餘担，所以稍可憐補。現在全縣人口六十九萬人，平均每；可耕者不過百分之一，二一畝弱，所以糧食的危機，潛伏頗深，每年都需向鄰縣探運。今年寗波的米運很多，姚所以米價尙低，每石廿三四萬元。餘姚民情，不論山區，鹽區·棉區·稻區，生活均尙儉樸。即如餘姚縣城，亦不說農業都市的本色，安靜平和，不像商業城市的煩亂囂張。現任縣參議會議長倪永强先生，更吿訴我一個特色：「旁的地方如果要請客宴會，無論是賣菜，請廚司，總是上城去，我們餘姚却相反，是要下鄉去找廚司，買小菜的。所以餘姚的重心是，在鄉鎭，而不在縣城。」</p>
<p>餘姚本來不是一個商業城市，但今日餘姚的商業，却更形凋零了。城裏最熱鬧的大街，「新建路」，已遠不及戰前的繁華。而且據餘姚浙東日報的總編輯馬忠傅告訴我：一就是現在的市面，也是外强中乾的。今年春季結賬的時候，已關閉了好多商店，而更多的是借了髙利貸在勉强維持着，景况是相當可憐的。商業的衰落，影響了我們報業，現在餘姚一共祇有二個報社，（另一是南雷日報），都豫以維持，所以早就改出四開報了。」</p>
<p>買通餘姚南北城之大橋（本報記者黄行天寄）</p>
<p>民情敦厚勤勞鄉村景況欠佳</p>
<p>鄉材裏的景况也不大好。餘姚人民男耕女織的敦厚動勞的風氣，雖仍保持着，但受外匯的影響，有些也已低落。姚南山區·原產茶葉，但是成本髙，無法出口，今年全省祇有一兩家茶廠開工，貨棄於地，祇好看它白白關掉，因此茶農遠二茶也不要採了。婦女呢，　前繼織享　運銷南洋，菲律賓一帶，是一大宗家庭手工業，女工多達五萬人，每天可出產一萬六干餘頂　精，每人月入約可得三十元，乃是家庭經濟的一大來源。但是現在，菲律賓的草帽絲不能大量進口，即使進朱的，也因工資低，所以多麼家庭婦女　磗去密布了。據　縣長說：「全縣經營織布的人數，現有二十萬人，用的都是「七七手搖機」，年產土布十萬疋，由內河向寗紹各屬運銷，是浙東農村衣料的大供應者。」至於姚北的　塲，那裏鑒民的生活更是艱困，而勞作也更辛勤。婦女也和男子一起工作，做那「括，淋，擁，晒」的製鹽工作。因爲那裏的情形特殊、記者將另寫專文報道。</p>

<p>復員以來，餘姚已一步堅實地踏上了建設的大道。治安問題雖因股匪的潛伏山區，深受咸會，但自從設立四明山綏靖區後，綏靖司令部坐鎭梁弄，專員公署也因便於鄭專員督勸殘匪，搬到餘姚來，因此今日四照山的殘部，己不足發生軍事效用。據當地的老百姓吿訴記者：「地方是已經安定了，祇是有些逃兵，有時乘其不備的做些不現事情，打家劫舍，則很少聽到。現在我們祇希望當局對淸動部隊的軍紀管東得更嚴些，因爲有此士兵的擾民，往往使我們對清鄉起了反感。如果當局不注意這些小節，將來可能轉變一般無知農民的觀念，以爲這和淪陷時代打游擊差不多。這是很危險的。」這是一個從農村裏來的知識份子所說的現宣同題，記者又對治安問題問過啓縣長，何時可以淸勦完畢。他說：「這很難說，我們的困難是以有形的對付無形的，以光明的對付黑暗的，以守法的對付不守法的，在行動上便有了顯著的不同。有時二三十個匪徒，突然襲擊一無防衛的鎭公所或警察局派出所，繳去了槍枝，便是這種困難的景顯著的例子。不過大體上，我們已做到了使殘匪無法作軍事活動的地步。我們現正趕築姚梁公路，一旦四明山區的交通便利，他們也就　法安於老巢了。」</p>
<p>因此，我們的話題就轉到鄰後的建設上來了。最値得一提的是公路建設。餘姚的公路交通，戰前已有相當基礎，惟在淪陷期中，全　破壤。卅四年九月，　府還治以後，即以恢復交通爲施政首要，苦心　劃，由旅滬同鄉資助。民營組建者，除杭甬鐵道這　（作為寗紹公路）外，有餘姚至周行，低塘至　車，勝堰至語山，及觀曹公路諸段，共達八十公里，耗資五億元以上。由將府自行發動興建者。有餘姚至潔弄長達廿二公里的餘梁公路。現已完成路　及土方。計劃中的路綫，還有樟（樹）薪（浦）路，長十公里，和餘（姚）（陸家埠）路，長六公里。現在姚北各鄉鎮，汽車均可直達，故已成爲浙江公路交通最發達的鹽份。至於鄉村電話之架設，按照計劃，係提據原査八個行政區爲中心，分區佈置，已經通話者，已佔全縣三分之一鄉村，另有三分之一，不久亦可通話。這對於鄉村治安是大有幫助的。</p>

<h3>縣府推行　兩項獨特運動　助穀興學公文檢查</h3>
<p>最近餘姚縣政府推行了兩件獨特的運動。其一爲「助穀與學遝動，」其一爲「實施公文檢査。」我國的所謂「公文政治，」必須經過收文、分科，撰擬，核判，繕校，監印，封發和歸檔等步驟，路長行緩，影響行政效力極大。　縣長是個年靑的政殺人員，因此他不願像老公務員的墨守成規，肯做些事。因此，他除了埋首本縣的復員建設事業外，更注意到切身的公交政治的效能問題。他除了收發，分科，核判，繕校，送印，歸檔等已有檢査辦法，最近更擬具了公文處理程序中最重要的一部份，即各科室人員對公務的核辦，撰擬，檢査辦法，俾不致停留遲緩。實施以來，收效頗宏。其辦法爲編列表格一套，以懲獎辦法，每半月檢査一次，據統計，現在每次檢査結果，未辦文件，平均僅達百分之九，五八，較未實行前，進步種大。因此，詹縣長希望這個辦法能隨時改進，使將來成為普遍的制度化，以帮助行政效力的提髙。至於「助穀興學，」是補救敎育經費的困難，和一捐資興學」差不多。即由有關各方組織專門委員會，規定田每畝助製六斤，沙田三斤，建地二斤，由佃業雙方各半負担，並規定每斤折收國幣一八〇元，辦理五月，已收一萬陸千萬餘元。三月份起，全縣的國民敎育經費就全賴此款。取之於民，用之於民，造福稚子，挽救國民敎育危機，這倒也是一個較好的辦法。</p>
<p>發揚先賢精神建設新的餘姚</p>
<p>三百年來，餘姚以「文獻名邦」薪稱，王陽明先生（一四七一——一五二八）於明成化八午生於北城壽山堂古瑞雲樓，以導學成名，創「知行合一」的學說。當他爲龍塲驛丞時，提倡敎育，薰陶風俗，化苗黎，平干戈，卓志苦行，功垂百歡。今北城龍泉山上，有陽明祠。造石像一尊，藍頗黑　，道貌莊嚴不幸竟被敵寇盜去，迄今猶未追還。其少時讚　晚年港學的　明審院，今亦殘破不堪，僅縣府門前的紀念石碑，猶供時人瞻仰。最近，姚人中國銀行總經理宋漢寧氏捐資十億，正在城北建一新式陽明醫院，備有X光可寫浙東第一流醫院。另一位以　硏經史，博治文詞著稱的黄黎洲（一六一〇一六九五）於明萬歷三十八年生於餘姚黄竹浦，不獨在史學上獨關　徑，著有「明　學案」「明夷待訪錄」，且爲一革命家，生平致力復用運動。其墓尙在離城二十里之　湖鄉化安山。又朵舜水（一六〇〇—一六八二）於明萬歷二十八年生於餘姚，是一個　及異邦的儒家。　痛明之覆，輒　海外。留日九年，一手創畫本文物制度，精學間，長工藝，主張實踐，排斥玄談。流亡日本，摹在日本瑞範山，餘　無古鎭。當敵軍攻定餘姚縣城後，即售集體舉行公祭，可見朱公在日之聲望。還有一位東漢的嚴子陵，也是餘姚人，本姓莊，遞明帝　，改名發光，字子陵，少與漢光武同　學，以崇尙氣節著於世。其墓在餘姚鄭山之間，勞有「髙風亭」。鄉亦改爲髙風鄉了。這四位先賢的石碑，都樹立在縣政府的門首，誰都崇楊他們的卓志苦行，名學髙風。六十九萬餘姚的國民，都應該以諸先賢爲自已的楷模去發掦他們的精神，來建設自己的故鄉。</p>
<h3>中國之友凱尼黛　鄺炳耀在影界坐上了第一把交椅</h3>
<p>在好萊塢的最後幾天逗留中，我會見了哥侖比亞影片公司的老闆之一，凱尼黛先生。凱尼黛的全名是乾，李却特，凱尼黛。他現在是哥侖比亞公司的「　乃人」，當當穿一身黑條子西裝，襯托着一張淸秀的圖圓的臉，對人很和氣，無論講什麽話，總是一　西洋社會最欣賞的「微笑的臉，」和客人談話的時候，香烟一枝一枝連　著油個不停，看模樣還種四十歲光景，因此，在好萊塢這個　干當中，他是屬於「少狀派」。</p>
<p>少壯派多半不滿意現狀，凱尼黛譯起這座電影王國中的成親積習，時時露出深惡痛絕之槪。譬如，他說：好萊塢上的許冬電影老闆，雷影導演，甚至大明星，他們決不相信中國人能　電影，「除了在中國國內，設備的簡陋，資金的不足以外，　　中國人的演戲的按巧，他們都非常懷疑。』凱尼黛曾經和很多電影界中的人物，硏究過此一問題，他們不是說中國人的表情不够，就是說中國人的動作笨拙。</p>
<p>演中國片　將聘僑胞主演</p>
<p>但是少壯派的凱尼黛，始終抱着一個懷疑的觀點。他決心要演一張中國的片子，不但要請中國人演而且要請中隊人演主角。他說：他深惡痛絕兩件事：第一是許多美國演員，冒充中國人演中國戲。第二，他痛惡許多彤片中，把中國人當「聽差」，當其它許許多多種類的醜角。</p>
<p>凱尼黛和毛根滔有深厚的人事上的關係，毛根滔當財政總長的時候，凱尼黛在財政　當專門委員，兼辦部長的「　要」，以及財政部對外的宣傳事宜。他是作家，文化人，戲劇家，公務員，也是有錢的資本家。在處理財政部機要的時候，他知道一件有關中國的雅片案，日本浪人走私運入中國，當時，他是『在職』的公務員，不能够立即撰寫這一故事，因之，又等待了好幾年。</p>
<p>毛根滔交卸財政部以後，凱尼黛拋產了這「窮差使」，無官一身輕，他又回到了編寫戲劇的生活，他在財政部所羅著的故事，經過他『妙筆生花』的潤色，終於搬上了哥侖比亞公可的銀幕，這就是『盜庫銀』的淵源。</p>
<p>凱尼黛說：「以後，我就處處物色中國演員當主角。這是一個相當傷腦筋的問題。』他曾　一度想到上海去招聘，但又擔心：中國電影演員的語言問題。他我：「美國影片當然要說英文，英文不僅要流利淸脆，而且要鏗鏘悅耳」！這樣，又一直躭擱了很久。</p>
<p>鄺炳雄氏　一個華僑明星</p>
<p>一個偶然的機會，使他在餐館中碰見了好萊塢的華僑明星隊炳雄，　從彩伐達結婚回來，帶着他的新娇夫人陳萃芳來好萊塢。凱尼黛的夫人，首先發現陣萃芳可以演戲，當時就談了許多身世和履歷，凱尼黛問陳：</p>
<p>『願不願意演電影？要請你擔任一部巨片的主角』？</p>
<p>『天哪，我從來就沒有演過電影，我什麽都不懂』！年輕的華僑新娘警奇地大呌起來。</p>
<p>有人說：這是凱尼黛「故作驚人之筆」，當凱尼黛在公司的業務會議上提出這一個新決定的時候，遭逢到嚴　的指斥和反對，但是，凱尼黛的陶脯，要投資二百萬塊錢；「如果盜庫銀的拍製失敗了，我願意汝担所有的損失！』</p>
<p>就這樣，一個從來沒有銀幕經騐的華僑女孩子，忽然進入了好萊塢的「明星」的圏子，美國的報紙上，雜誌上，都用專欄刊登了出來，舊金山的華文報紙，更詳細報道了這一條新聞。</p>
<p>僑生青年　自述演戲經過</p>
<p>我在好萊塢碰見鄺炳雄君夫婦，鄺君的英文名字呌做「邊沁方」，那是根據廣東土　直譯的，酈君是台山人，僑生在加利福尼亞的薩可孟城，幼年的時候，一度回到廣東念書，後來又在嶺南大學一廣求學，我看見他的客堂裏，還掛着嶺南大學的校旗。</p>
<p>酈現在才祇二十八歲，自從黃柳　退伍以後，他現在算是好萊塢上中國演員的第一把交椅了，我和中西部或西岸許多華僑青年男女們談天，對於「邊沁方」，他們都有一種汪熱的崇拜。</p>
<p>據酈炳雄自己說：他的小天下，最初是「派拉蒙」提披他的，後來，他替幾家公司都演過戲，在好萊塢上，和他有關係的影片有三十四部，三十三張在好萊塢拍攝，一張在墨西哥拍的。他的英文說得非常漂亮，　也懂西班牙文。但是，他不會講國語，除了台山的方言以外，連「普通話」也非常難說。我勸他：中國人學國語，不算太難。演有關中國的電影，如果戲裏面有幾句要用中文來　挿，最好說國語？</p>
<p>國內　衆大槪也有「邊沁方」的印象。「黑龍會陰媒」，他演殺父親的義子，「東京上空三十沙」，（“Kingcom”）都有他的鐘頭，「陳査理探案」中，他還是飾陳　　的第二子。最近他在墨西哥攝的西班牙文影片，呌做：「上海夜總會。」</p>
<p>留美僑星　約共有三百名</p>
<p>出現在好萊塢上的中國演員，大的有三百人，包括臨時演員和羣衆演員在內，此外，也有日本人，朝鮮人，菲列賓人，他們常常冒充中國人攝片。戰爭期間，從一九四一年到一九四五年，是華僑演員的黄金時代，許多中國人，常常飾日本軍閥之類的角色，有一個姓羅的，以演飾日本軍閥著名。</p>
<p>鄭炳雄的新婚夫人陳萃芳，「盜庫銀」的主角，現在還祇二十歲，她生在美國工業中心迪屈魯城，父親是一個廣東籍的僑商，在那兒經營一家「華利公司」，陳萃芳演戲的「筆名」，呌「美　」（Maylia），我參觀哥侖比亞影片公司的那天，識起「美麗」，大有「無人不知」之槪。</p>
<p>據凱尼黛說：「盜庫銀」的攝製工作，相當的可以滿意，男主角狄克鮑威爾，「魔擒王」的主角，不但是「紅星」，而且是哥侖比亞的台柱，女主角「美麗陳」，雖然是生手，但他很努力，很虛心，肯學習，再加之天份髙，演來和老資格的明星沒有分別！</p>
<p>他還說：「一個中國國人的演員，在好萊塢拿五百塊錢一星期的　水是破天荒的，當我決定的時候，許多人罵我，反對我，但是我為了愛護我的影片——盜庫銀，我決定這樣做！」</p>
<p>盜庫銀的外景隊到上海去了，今年年底，無論如何，可以全部剪接完成。凱尼黛要選我再來好萊塢，看來來的預演，我非常感謝他的好意。東同意他的見解。我吿訴他一句話：讓那些輕視中國藝術的傢伙，到中國去看看罷</p>
<p>凱尼黛頻頻點頭，他說，他相信中國的戲劇界，一定有不平凡：的貢獻與造就。他說他隨時願意到中國去觀光，如果中國的藝術界那一天歡迎他去中國的話！（本報特派員毛樹淸帝自紐紐）</p>

<h3>中國藝術之路</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>兩星期前看到本刋「中國藝術往那裏走」的一個特輯，同道的朋友們都提出許許多多寳貴的意見，作爲今後中國藝術工作者的指引。</p>
<p>當然，在十幾篇短短的文章裏，是每一個人從各種不同角度之下所提示的最深切，最合理的意見；有人主張建立客觀批評與新的理論，有人主張表現自我，有人主張藝術大衆化，……諸如此類，的確把中國藝術的癥結所在如何診療的方法都提了出來。可是，現實如此，客觀因素巳經證明中國藝術是「此路不通」了。</p>
<p>藝術土的新理論與批評，是藝術作品的基礎，然而，在現在的中國藝術界裏，究竟那些才是算新的理論？這是一種標準，所謂客觀的批評，就是新的理論的運用。</p>
<p>中國的民主建國運動，已經有了數十年的歷史，而這一運動的歷史任務，是建設民有民治民享的國家，而中國的藝術之路，是不能違背了這一種要求而孤立起來的。所以要解決中國藝術的出路問題，首先應該看淸中國建設的出路問題是什麼？</p>
<p>從這一個問題而來的是「自我表現」。因爲，我自決計不能與現實絕對游離，如果是想借藝術來高蹈現實，遁隱山林，就算表現自我。其實，這是逃避現實，這種自我表現，與中國新藝術的建立有何關係？</p>
<p>關於藝術大衆化的一個問題，這是抗戰以來普遍於各個藝術部門而已經努力推行的。但問題不盡在把高貴的藝術送到大衆的隊伍之中，而最緊要的這種藝術究竟與大衆發生多少關係？換句話說：這種藝術是否通過了時代的潮流，社會的要求，人民的生活而建立的？</p>
<p>這許多大前提決定了。自然，「仿」也不須仿了，「假畫」也不必造了。從此中國藝術，不但「重量」，而且「重質」，那麼可以安步當車，走自己的路，向復興的路上去。到這時候，中國藝術的新形式也就創造成功了。</p>
<p>時代是前進的，中國的藝術工作者，只有面對現實，迎接時代，努力創造，才是當前的中國藝術之路。</p>
<h3>海粟先生畫展印象記</h3>
<p>— 灃莉</p>
<p>一進中國藝苑，空氣立刻改變，一種清朗美化的氣氛，兩面中西畫，一望不盡。中間方柱子邊，放着鏤空的磁凳，和盆中的夾竹桃，石榴花，窗邊，放着長椅，對面牆壁邊，放了幾只別人送來的花籃，麻布幃幔把藝苑分隔着，對着一排窗的牆壁，完全掛着油畫，其餘都是國畫，而第一間，完全是劉夫人夏伊喬女士的國畫作品，一幅一幅的畫排列非常勻稱。</p>
<p>我是不懂繪畫的，但是這次畫展似乎抓住了我一點興趣。</p>
<p>我記得當我看到「瑞山烟雨圖」時，我曾退後幾步欣賞，好似一陣冷風把我捲入那烟雨圖中</p>
<p>兩幅「釣雪圖」，表現着兩種意味，一幅是隔着山石窺望雪中的批外樂園，一幅是寫爪哇的雪山聳立。</p>
<p>「通錦江干雪霽圖」，是四幅並在一起，煊染出雪　後的錦綠江山。</p>
<p>「紅梅」有好幾幅，有的畫在金箋上，有的畫在白絹上，一幅較大的金箋上的紅海，題爲「　鬥漢宮春」，和牠相對的一幅「縱橫鬱勃」，是金箋上的蒼松。</p>
<p>「驚烏圖」，一隻驚烏蹲在樹上，烱烱目光，其餘小鳥飛逃，牠們驚惶的神氣，襯托出驚烏不羣。</p>
<p>「雲移怒翼搏千里」的鷹，和「滾馬」，充分表現着熱烈的</p>
<p>國畫中的「雙駿」，與油畫中的「雙駿」，性質完全不同，前者是表現粗野，後者是表現馴服。</p>
<p>國畫「羣牛岡」，和油畫「水牛」，都是表現牛的天性，尤其以油畫中兩頭水牛浮在水中，更能呈現牠們的自然。</p>
<p>油畫中給我印象最深的是，「蘇提晨曦」，和「柳林月色」。我愛蘇堤的倒影和淡紅色的朝　，這些寄給我無限的美趣。「柳林月色」，我覺得不是柳林而是椰林，因此更充溢着人約黃昏後的熱情。</p>
<h3>貴婦像</h3>
<p>— 賀爾濱</p>
<p>賀爾濱（H.　Holbein　1497-1543）與丟拉是德意志兩個傑出人才，靑年時代很清苦，僅僅是為書店描繪挿圖：旣後被文豪Erasmus發現了他的天才，給他極大的鼓勵，不久即告大成。</p>
<p>所作以肖像居多，綫條秀勁，色彩富麗，姿態莊嚴，尤其注重裝飾，其細膩精巧之用筆，可謂空前絕後。該作原藏柏林國立美術館。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>啟程</h3>
<p>— 臧贊</p>
<p>當米勒繪畫的才能漸漸顯露時，他的父親就帶他去見一位古典派的畫師顯布爾，這位大衛的學生驚喜之下說：</p>
<p>『把這孩子關在家裏是有罪的」。</p>
<p>尊視孩子的希望，讓他去他所響往的地方。照記德的說法：家不是可愛的，人不能成天地被關在家裏；犬樹附近的小樹永遠不能長得健康。</p>
<p>小鷄不能永遠躱身在蛋亮裏；小烏不能永遠躲在巢裏，烏生來不是為了巢，是為了飛行於藍天與樹梢。一切學習，都為了生活；也為了生活的創造。</p>
<p>像太戈爾的幼年，沒有學校時，極想進學校，進了學校却又想離開學校，雖然他的功課很好。我們深知多少人徘徊在學校的門外，多少人進了學校，沒有經濟的支持而又離校——今天你們從這衆人嚮往的藝術之門出來，不知有多少羨慕的眼光落在你們的身上。</p>
<p>這種可喜的心情或許不爲你們瞭解，因爲你們正落於徬徨無依，找不到職業的心淸中，當然再躱進母親的翅膀下或懷裏那是不可能的。</p>
<p>面臨這個眞正的大地，蓋覆於你頭上的不再是屋頂而是藍天或烏雲，撫摩你頭髮與手臂的不再是你的母親而是野風或太陽，那些呈現於窗格外的一切：風暴與雷雨，虹彩與白　都爲你接觸或交流，這個世界廣大，新鮮，可是也有風浪，……</p>
<p>在廣大中，沒有牆壁，沒有限制；</p>
<p>在新鮮中，有烏的歌聲，花的芳香，露水的閃爍；</p>
<p>在風浪中——沒有別的，靠自已搏鬥。</p>
<p>廣大，新鮮，風浪有着同一個要求——成爲一個眞正的人，眞正的藝術家。堅持你那塊善良的心田，不出賣自己，不出賣衆人尊崇的藝術。藝術家是人類靈魂的工程師，作人類靈魂的護士，人類靈魂的榜樣。——萬一修理不了別人的靈魂，也得修整自已的靈魂。</p>
<p>（如若有人以近視爲現實；只求眼前的獲得，這裏我們不必去多談。）</p>
<p>人生的義意是建設，不是破壞與附和破壞。因爲世界不只是屬於你，是屬於整個過去與未來的人類的。相信眞理，相信她巳來到這世界的陽光中，相信她在你的心裏，將由你手指間流出。</p>
<p>五年，十年，二十年一閃就過去了，過去的準備着明天的啓程，一切都爲了明天的啓程。前面是海洋般深廣的蔚藍，無底的幸福與自由，和那等待着的風暴，與一切閃電，火光與搏鬥。</p>
<h3>畫竹新論</h3>
<p>— 陳定山</p>
<p>定山居士嘗自稱，吾詩第一，草賽第三，無第二。近年以來，獨於畫竹發憤不輟。周子拜花進而稱曰：先生畫竹，貫通詩書，可當第二，完成三絕矣。居士擲筆曰：難言之，難言之。</p>
<p>夫歷代畫竹，以東坡與可爲二派。東坡爲文人派。以趙子昂柯丹丘裏首，至王孟端而弱。與可一派，爲寫實派。以李息　夏仲昭衷首。至文徵仲而息。淸代畫竹，皆學石濤，這破畫竹家法。當世畫竹，獨吳子深存夏太常規模；吳湖帆自向趙仲穆得筆，余越園刻意於宋仲溫，皆畫竹之賢者。張大千別自金冬心發生會心，雋逸不羣。葉譽虎善畫小竹，筆尖自有一種剛勁之氣，大似南越王佗。老夫取足自娛之致。要其合處，亦當仲溫。王季遷師事吳湖帆甚虔，獨其畫竹，自謂勝師。以予觀之，則其夫人鄭元素竹，乃不愧管道昇耳。應野苹畫竹，力爭上游，然覇氣不除，有石濤在其胎子裏。唐雲以華新羅法畫竹，一莖數葉，具見佳致。其他賢如馮超然吳待秋，獨於畫竹不無遺憾，故存而不論也。若僕者，敢自詡乎？周子曰：僕隨定山三十年，未嘗聞其月旦人物。敢退而記之。</p>
<h3>觀大千畫幅</h3>
<p>— 蔣蘇厂</p>
<p>才難多能入聖域，畫苑有口皆成碑；海氣昏沉世杌　，豁目四顧光陸離；累壁忍呵障猶濕，烟嵐繆饒草木滋。夕照半落幻明滅，曉靄橫抹升淸暉；蘆汀　　片帆挂，鐘聲幾杵穿林扉。江山萬里縮丈尺，臥游未覺渴與飢。畫界已過郭忠衣冠更溯前古製，曼　窈窕軒娥眉；翠翹珠袖舞頓挫，曹衣吳帶臨眞妃。生香沒骨奪粉本，舖殿紅紫爭芳菲；蜷鬚鳳子着閒罅，玉　紫燕穩踏校；海圖藻井工組織，曲折巧匠技莫施。　志專精合衆妙，漫舉南北宗相推；怪事何修坐致此，淵游二老尊本師。五車讀破通六法，劇迹天壤容遍窺；休論天都展　折，胸儲五岳窮　奇。伯也同氣該雄長，風生谷嘯當披應；奈何禺域倫破碎，馳驅蜀道哀援　，荷戈有人恣殺敵；裏糧足蘭隴坂西；關塞荒寒闢異境，沙黃草白紅柳稊；武梁阿空薄石刻，石窟摸索縑素遺；寢饋渾忘疊寒署，逢源左右取不疲。雲母粉乳兎豪　；丹砂沈著輕燕支；石靑金泥并收蓄，佐使永墨無不宜。是何瞻識健且勇，大任擔起八代衰；目無宋元况晚代，冶今鎔古心罅錘；玻璃景攝虎質似，世趨捷徑寗知非。獨開風氣標正向，天人兼到功不虧；由來盛名豈虛擁，價重萬鎰奚驚疑。美髯間年未及艾，頤情悅性媲大痴；千秋早釀出頭地，一諾毋憚神來揮；物我不變無盡藏，徵君俯仰將安歸！</p>
<h3>近百年之中國繪畫</h3>
<p>— 陳倚石</p>
<p>唐張彥遠稱：『所謂畫者，與六籍同功，四時並運，……』是一代之興替，有系於文運；文運之振　，則有寓於畫者甚顯，　白馬寺之『千乘萬騎　塔三匝岡」，其雄偉樸茂，實足以示漢代一統天下文運興隆之精神，共後如隋唐，如南北宋，如明，如淸，莫不有其一代顯著之特徵。試觀明末，有節之士，胸懷鬱抑，縱橫磅　之氣傾吐於籃　丹青間，別具一格，蔚成時代作風，使吾國之院派畫與文人畫，分界益彰，但是秦漢迄淸，一千餘年間，中國之畫風，號幾經蛻變，就社會觀點言之，尙可謂長期間之定型時代。迨至道光間鴉片戰爭，與成豐同治間太平天國之變，一切民族意識，社會生活均有劇烈轉移，如學術思想，宗敎風俗，科學精神等，直接間接，影響於中國畫風者至鉅且甚。民元而還，交通便捷，東西洋距離日形縮短，文化交流日形緊寗，乃使此百年間繪畫，派別更多，門戶紛岐，莫衷一是；其紛亂復雜之情形，實爲百年以前所罕有。就書法而論，明淸以前，學書者篤守閣帖，遜淸中葉以後，學者乃旁臨金石拓本，從此書法另關一徑，繪畫受其極大影響，於是繪畫乃有金石氣之時尙；近人中如吳昌碩即其一例。是百年間中國畫壇之複雜演變，已如上述，吾人推此而知近百年之繪畫，已有劃時代之趨勢，不僅其在美術本身上具有研討整理之價値。且於整個文化上，亦堪爲歷史時代之反映。上海市敎靑當局，與美術界有鑑於此，故於前此，上海市美術館籌備處座談會間，對於此劃時代之百年繪畫，僉謂有系統研究之必要。吾人當知中國繪畫旣有悠久歷史之光榮，再於百年內錯綜複雜之畫風中、擷其優點條理而分析之，則不僅光前，抑且谷後矣。章炳麟先生嘗稱：『孔子不布春秋，前人往不能語後人，後人亦無以識前』。因爰書數語，以示吾人勿忘當前畫壇之春秋大任乃可。</p>
<p>星期閑話</p>
<h3>日本，日本！</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>澳大利亞駐華公使柯伯蘭敎授，提起日本問題，他說：「一兩月來中國報紙已漸對日本現狀表示關切，中國人似乎已感到日本現在之發展，造成對中國之威脅。」</p>
<p>日本投降後到現在僅僅不到兩年，但盟軍統帥克阿愁對於日本的寬容，放縱，中國人民怎麼不關心？</p>
<p>日本對外貿易正式恢復了，在中國——當一切輕工業，紡織業，在戰後二年尙未復員的階段，正如某通訊社在東京發出的電訊：「日本民間對外貿易恢復後，輕工業製品一項與中國對外貿易之利益衝突最大。」</p>
<p>至於美國已准許日本至南極捕鯨咯；開放安加島准許日本採取磷酸鹽礦略；日漁人要求在千島海面捕魚咯；美國不顧各方面的反對，竟然付諸執行，不單無視於英國，挪威，澳大利亞的抗議，而且對中國目前的處境與利益，好像也未加以考慮，這是為了什麼呢？</p>
<p>而最荒謬的日本的所謂「支那通」之一的前上海科學研究會員小宮吉高博士，竟然宣稱：「日本將援助中國經濟之復興。」他的理由及推論是中國一切不如日本，所以中國并未停止期望日本領導。</p>
<p>這些言論與日本侵略中國及遠東時候所倡導的「東亞共榮圈」又有什麼不同？盟軍佔領日本二年後所謂已摧毀日本一切軍國主義思想的揚言，賢明如盟軍統帥麥克阿瑟，又作何感想？</p>

<p>他說：麥帥的管制政策極賢明；美國因不能長期負擔日本之給養，所以才扶助日本小工業及准許捕魚。至於畏懼日本東山再起，中國可以不必顧慮，因爲美國當然會嚴密加以監視的。</p>

<h3>蒼涼的藝人　——為紀念劉寶全作</h3>
<p>— 司空無忌</p>
<p>在同時代中，最令我神往的有兩位藝人。一位是芳華絕代的梅蘭芳，另一位是倫落老死了的劉寳全。</p>
<p>我曾用兩句　詩詞，作爲他們兩個人的像讚。梅是：「偶與人間爭富貴，萬花齊首拜春風。」劉是：「西風殘照，漢家陵闕。」前者雍容華貴，可寓之爲牡丹，不，還是譬之如獨步早春的梅花吧。後者則如汨羅江畔的蘆荻，在暮色的秋風裏，發出瑟瑟的聲音，令人興起　一種蒼茫之感。</p>
<p>當我提起筆來追述劉寳全蒼凉的一生，眞是不禁感慨萬千。</p>
<p>這位鼓王的幼年情况，已經很難以稽考。</p>
<p>總之，他的檀板生涯開始得極早。在晚淸的社會風氣，向來輕視伶人，而唱大鼓的更是伶人中的等而下之的了。太史公所謂「倡優蓄之，流俗之所種」。藝人生在這個祿　的國度要，那也只有被侮辱與被損害的份兒。我時常傻想，如果英國的大文豪莎士比亞生在中國的話，其地位當遠不若錢塘的妓女蘇小小受人歡迎。</p>
<p>寳全並沒有機會像那些達官顯仕的子弟一樣，接受他應該受的敎育。（現在的敎育也沒有兩樣呀。正是：「學府機關八字開，有志無錢莫進來」。）可是寳全却在那血淋淋的現實中，打了無數次的滾，他從實生活中經騐到一切殘酷的人道。他洞徹世情，他有一顆善良的向上的心。他雖然看不慣這光怪陸離的社會，可是他終於忍受了。爲了生活，爲了從有閒的炎人中，分到最最起碼的生活。</p>
<p>康德說：「天才是天生的。天才不能純由學力」。在天才之產生不能由人預期諸點上說。寳全是可以够資格的。</p>
<p>可是，人總是脫不開現實的土壤的。天才云云，只是指他有强烈的敏說的超常人的感覺性而已。</p>
<p>在烏煙瘴氣的人　，任是最向上的人，也難兔有靈魂午睡的時候。寳全在他薄有聲名，被人稱爲小實全的時候，他染上了鴉片的嗜好，每個時代都有牠各自不同的道德觀念，抽鴉片在晚淸之普遍，正有如今日之抽紙烟，是不足垢病的。</p>
<p>中國人有一種最恥辱的習性，就是自己從上一代接受了痛苦和不幸，又絲毫沒有改變地，甚至變本加厲地，將痛苦和不幸遺交給下一代。父親　了兒子一個嘴巴，瞪着眼，吹着鬍子說：「你敢不聽話？我三十歲那年，你爺爺還要打我呢！」</p>
<p>這種恥辱的習性，我自然是指一般而言。任何一種品行要跳過自私，要能捨己爲人，才能成就其偉大。</p>
<p>寳全有了孩子，他回顧自己這一行，在社會上之受人鄙視。他不願意把這種父傳的職業繼續下去。他盼望他的孩子能不再受侮辱，能光耀門庭，能步入「高等社會」；我們不能唱高調，批評這種看法對不對，因爲被壓迫的人之想伸伸他的腰，是極自然的事。</p>
<p>寶全的自覺性，使他竭他微薄的收入來培養他的孩子。</p>
<p>孩子一天天的大起來，他不但是不能體恤父親的苦心，甚至還痛恨他「說大鼓」的父親。他認爲他父親的職業，損害了他的榮譽。</p>
<p>敎育啊敎育。「上流人」的敎育，把寳全之子的人性禠奪了嗎？</p>
<p>和一切眞實的故事一樣，我沒有方法描寫那一段悠長的也是艱辛的生涯。（上）　日本推行飢餓出口</p>
<p>出口冠稱飢餓，好新鮮語！不知進口飽何人？憑史地，該先我？</p>

<h3>阿里山神木</h3>
<p>— 麥繼鈺</p>
<p>「神木」、不是玄虛，確是奇蹪，它是阿里山原始林樹齡最大的紅檜，此老雖飽經風霜，但龐然高聳，道貌岸然，令遊者不禁肅敬，故日人稱之爲「神木」。記得有人說過：「沒有到阿里山不知道台灣的美麗，沒有到阿里山，不知道台灣的偉大，沒有到阿里山，不知道台灣的富藏」。但我得另外補上一句：「沒有到阿里山，不知神木的奇蹟。」</p>
<p>筆者在台灣「二二八」事件平定後，因即離海島北歸，乃決定到阿里山虔敬那神木，以作紀念。時遊客裏足，因淸鄉工作自魏主席蒞台後已告結束，但過去肇事的人，仍有潛伏中央山脉一帶，時出槍殺外省人，由於神木的誘惑，我甘與生命打賭。</p>
<p>六月二日晨，我與張君乘小火車由嘉義市向阿里山出發，軍小軌小，是一種爬山的特別火車，僅拖狹窄車廂三節，搭客多係帶貨走單幫者，因上山頂可獲借利，故車廂鷄鴨雜貨和我交錯擁擠，大煞風景。全車僅我與張君係外省人，餘均台語娓娓，若再惹起仇殺，我們必爲肉餅無疑，心殊惴惴。</p>
<p>車過竹琦後，便徐徐上坡，漸漸循着山巒曲折盤昇，深林山谷，幽雅入勝，我們據窗眺望，似乘汽艇漂渺凌空，巨岩，小阜，烟樹，雲溪，都在脚下，價是層層奇景，歎爲觀止。下午一時，到了奮起湖，因拔海已愈二千公尺，故氣候轉冷，雲　如大軍呼嘯，層　被吞吃下去，加以細雨濛濛，火車像沐浴在雲山　海裏；我們沿途通過六十三個隧道，下午四時終於在神本車站給我所仰望的神木拖下車來，它離阿里山終點僅二公里。</p>
<p>巨大無朋的神木，就在車站旁邊，像傲骨凌　的老戰士挺立着，四周却給木栅保護，像是怕　人損壞此老人的膚肌，附近森林　鬱，紅檜，扁柏，松，杉，梅等，交錯聳立，高可參天，均二三千年樹齡，像一個個巨老的薩神，拱衛着那神木；遙望那些老人們的枝葉，密匝匝遮滿了天，化成各色各樣猙猙可怕的形狀，隨着灰濛濛的細霧，自野中昇起，是一層陰暗的面紗，罩住原始林木底全貌，加重了牠底神秘與陰沉。莽莽蒼蒼，使我們彷若置身在菲洲的剛果國。</p>
<p>但原始林中最出衆的，自然是那神木；它是一株三千歲的紅檜，此樹高五十三公尺，底面周圍三十四公尺點三，要三十多個人接手才能擁它一個合抱，在我們大陸里，恐怕誰也無法看見這樣大的樹木吧！</p>
<p>太興奮了，我知張君在此老的軀幹旁邊，徘徊仰視，有時感情衝動，禁不住儘情撫摸它的　子和膚肌；三千年它生於此，長於此，抵抗了風夾，雨打，地震，和電　，而矻立無恙，我們五十而和天命的人，誰能目睹它的終年呢？</p>
<p>神木對我們始終默默無言，它知道得太多了！天地悠悠，我們一代一代接下去，獨此老見過古人，還要見來者；它確是阿里山的精靈，海島的紛擾，將隨着它的崇高即昇華到無涯的空際。</p>
<h3>文人悲哀</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>文人多「窮」，自古已然。於今爲烈！所謂：以文化人自命的揑筆桿朋友，雖然困居斗室，衣不蔽體，食不果腹，而仍然一天到晚的絞腦汁，榨牛奶，所得的待遇，却微薄可憐得使人不能想像！有許多作家，連個人生活，還難以維持，更談不到什麼仰事俯蓄了。自古以來，窮途末路的，都是青衫一衿的書生，想不到現在還是如此！難道文化人是一輩子注定了「苦命」的嗎？報戰：文化人王昌整君，因拼命投稿，所入不足以生活，遂弄了一把手槍，實行搶刦上海銀行，結果被捕解送法院，判刑七年，據王君當庭宣稱：「本不願槍錢，但進備犯法坐牢，至少可以解決個人生活，因我儘量投稿，亦活不了也」云云。文化人末路的哀鳴，誰不感慨萬端，寄以同情之淚！</p>
<p>政府未能維護文化界，文化界未能救助文化人，這是我中國文化界之恥！願我文化界同人，爲拓展文化，爭取生存而有以善其後，雪其恥，否則：文化人的沒落，也就是文化事業的生存絕望！爰大聲疾呼，寫此文以喚起我文化界同人的警覺。</p>

<h3>葉公超這個人</h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>現在，也許我們應當稱呼他一葉次長」了罷——但是，如果我們眞是當面這樣稱呼他，我知道他準會不高興。我們還是當面呌他「葉先生」，背後呌他「喬治·葉」（George　Yeh），比較妥當。</p>
<p>爲甚麼呢？我告訴你；</p>
<p>去年冬天，我在南京拜訪胡適之先生，提起葉先生的時候，我們的胡大使就笑着說了一句精彩的話——「嚇，紫先生不是做了很大的官了麼！」</p>
<p>那時候，葉先生是外交部歐洲司長，現在是次長了，順着胡先生的口氣說，誠然應該是「更大的大官」了。但是，自有中國以來，外交部次長多得很，「喬治·葉」却是唯一的。</p>
<p>他豈止一個外交部次畏而已！</p>
<p>譬如說，他是一位Gontleman。這個字無論是譯作「紳士」或「君子」，對絮先生都很確切。所謂「紳士」，決非衹是衣飾整潔，彬彬有禮而已。葉先生的慷概，熟誠，更決非那些專門摹傲Gentlemen'sGentleman的人們所能妄萬一，淸華園裏有一則流行得很廣的葉先生的軼事：葉先生收藏古玩，畫畫，書籍都很豐富，據說，如果有人到他家裏，看見了那些古玩之類實在覺得愛不忍釋的時候，祇要葉先生一看此人確係識家，就往往立刻奉贈。但是你如果祇是信口開河的附庸風雅的俗物，那麼對不起，他也許當面就給你一個下不去。</p>
<p>也許我可以說，葉先生有「三分公子，七分名士」氣。誠然，他常常打扮得全身無懈可擊，可是他不修邊幅的時候也並不是沒有：冬天會在皮袍子裏面穿一套筆挺的洋裝（而且領帶都是打得整整齊齊的）；穿長衫時頸口的鈕扣常不扣上，而最近有一位新聞記者到國際飯店去拜訪他時，推進房門就大吃了一驚——原來葉先生穿的衣服就和浸在洛缸裏的時候差不多！（當然這位記者先生是一位「先生」而非「女士」；據說葉先生就對客穿衣，而客人倒爲之坐立不安頗久。）</p>
<p>然而，葉先生要是存心考究起來，可也風不含胡！不單是全身Immatcnlateto　the　last　detail，即使說話時候用起字眼來也不肯稍爲苟且。舉一個例罷：他曾說過，北平土話固然頗爲美麗而富有色彩，然而像「壓根兒」這個詞就見得寒傖，應當摒棄不用。</p>
<p>葉先生寫一手好散文，寫一筆好字，興來時也偶然做幾首宋人氣息甚厚的律詩</p>
<p>不過我不能在提起葉先生的時候肆無忌憚地談詩，因爲我知道他最恨的便是「淺薄」。</p>
<p>但是，我不能不　到他的英文，讓我借一句別人的話罷——</p>
<p>有一天，我和前任英國大使館新聞參贊麥唐納先生（Collim　Mac　Donald談起葉先生。麥公正色說：「葉先生的英文可眞是十全十美的英文（Perfect　English）了！」</p>

<h3>U.S. Announces Increased Aid to China: Consideration of Arms Sales and Loans; Our Government to Issue Policy Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The government is expected to issue a formal statement regarding its policy on the current situation. It is rumored that this statement may be released on the 30th after a joint meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] Government officials today expressed deep welcome for the U.S. decision to lift the ban on military supplies to China, calling it the most significant step in American policy. It is generally believed that the lifting of the arms embargo and the statement by Martin, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, regarding the preparation for loans have strengthened the position of the Nanjing government and dispelled fears that the United States would ignore the China problem. The morale of the National Army will surely be boosted, and the order to suppress the Communist army may be issued more quickly as a result. A stronger attitude will also be taken in diplomacy with the Soviet Union, especially in dealing with the issue of Dalian and Lushun. In addition, Lou Tongsun, chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs Committee, commented on Martin's statement, saying that what China urgently needs is to obtain large loans from the United States immediately to stabilize China's economic position. Lou refused to reveal whether the government would issue new currency to stabilize the economy after obtaining U.S. loans, but sources with inside knowledge say this is indeed the government's plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Given the difficulties faced by the Chinese government, the United States is providing moral and material support by selling arms to China for use by the National Army against the Communist army. This decision was made because the National Army is valiantly containing the advance of the Communist army in the Northeast and because President Chiang and his senior advisors are pursuing a firm anti-Soviet and anti-Communist policy. This move also marks the end of the neutral policy towards the Chinese civil war held by General Marshall when he went to China in 1945 to mediate, a policy that lasted for eighteen months. The United States is now using all its strength to help President Chiang deal with the Communist Party, and a large-scale and long-term economic aid plan for China is expected soon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] The State Department announced that the United States has agreed to sell surplus U.S. military rifle bullets to China. The Chinese government may also purchase any aircraft or other military equipment from the U.S. military with funds, and may also purchase military equipment from U.S. commercial manufacturers. The Export-Import Bank also announced that it will consider granting special loans to China. This action by the State Department and the Export-Import Bank is believed to have been approved by Secretary of State Marshall, although it is a major decision since Marshall abandoned mediating the Chinese civil war in January, it is still far from what the Chinese government has applied for.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 27th] The U.S. State Department announced on the 27th that the Foreign Liquidation Commission has signed an agreement with China to sell 13 million rounds of 7.92mm ammunition to the Chinese government for $656,658. The original value of this ammunition was $6,566,589. This ammunition is similar to .30 caliber rifle ammunition and was manufactured by the United States between 1942 and 1944. It was originally intended to be shipped to China under the Lend-Lease program at China's request, but due to transportation difficulties during the war, it could not be shipped as scheduled. This ammunition is for a special caliber used by China, so it is not suitable for the U.S. military and has become surplus U.S. government material, currently stored in western states. All shipping issues will be handled by the Chinese government itself.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Martin, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, announced on the 27th that the Export-Import Bank is currently preparing to consider credit loans for various special projects in China, regardless of the expiration on June 30th of the $500 million of other potential credit loans allocated to Chinese government agencies and private enterprises. This is the first official U.S. announcement that the $500 million loan allocated to China in April last year will be allowed to expire. Martin also stated that the Export-Import Bank will pay attention to the basic principles guiding loan activities in all regions of the world when applying for any grain loans. He said that the Export-Import Bank, in following the policies determined by Congress, will only grant loans for (1) promoting U.S. foreign trade, (2) not competing with private capital, (3) having special purposes, and (4) the board of directors believes there is a reasonable guarantee of repayment. Martin's statement, in fact, indicates that the action of reviving the credit loan program is returning to its original primary purpose, which is to fund and facilitate special U.S. imports and exports. This includes funding U.S. tools and technical services for foreign production enterprises. He further stated that the general rule of the Export-Import Bank is only to fund the purchase of goods and tools produced or manufactured in the United States, as well as the hiring of technical personnel from U.S. companies, which is different from the expenses for goods and personnel purchased by borrowing countries in their own countries.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] A government spokesman said on the evening of the 28th regarding the Washington dispatch of the U.S. Export-Import Bank's announcement that the $500 million loan deadline will not be extended after the end of June: The external affairs have not yet received official documents regarding this notification. At the same time, we have not received a report from our ambassador to the United States, so the official side cannot express any opinion on this matter. As for whether the $500 million loan will be established before the end of June, we still have a final hope for the next two days. According to reporters from other sources, the government is indeed in negotiations with the United States for new loans.</p>
<h3>No Matter Pro-U.S. or Pro-Soviet, National Interests Should Take Priority</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Delivers Speech on World Situation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] Vice President Sun Ke, at the invitation of the Returned Students Association on the evening of the 28th, gave a speech on the current world situation, saying that the key to whether a third world war can be avoided lies in whether the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can be reconciled and whether the United Nations organization can be strengthened. As for China, it should neither be pro-American and anti-Soviet, nor should it be pro-Soviet and anti-American. As the Chinese Communists have done in the Northeast, those with a conscience cannot do this. Our pro-American and pro-Soviet stances should be based on the interests of the nation and the people. We are pro-American because they are beneficial to China, and we are pro-Soviet because it can bring stability to the country. Stability can lead to revitalization. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced the process of negotiations with the Soviet Union to recover Dalian and Lushun, making public our position and the reasons why our government cannot take over the Northeast to the world. According to his personal observation, this is enough to promote the removal of misunderstandings between China and the Soviet Union and enhance friendship.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Current Situation: Hopes for Active U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Our Report] State Councilor Wang Chonghui is scheduled to return to Nanjing the day after tomorrow. He told reporters yesterday that the deteriorating situation in the East and the awakening of American public opinion have led the U.S. government to adopt measures to provide military assistance. Our country has fought for eight years, and the remaining amount of military supplies is limited, so although the current assistance is not direct, it has opened up the source of our military supplies, which shows its sincerity in assisting the National Government. I hope that this is only a preliminary assistance, and that it can become more active in the future. Because our country's situation and circumstances are no different from those of Greece and Turkey, and logically speaking, it should receive the same level of support. Furthermore, the United Kingdom and the United States should bear some responsibility for the current crisis in our country, because both countries are signatories to the Yalta Secret Agreement. Our country has suffered significant sacrifices because of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, but it has not yet gained peace. Regarding the failure to extend the deadline for the U.S. Export-Import Bank loan, Wang believes that the extension has been made more than once. If direct loans cannot be obtained, extending the deadline will also be of no use. He hopes that the U.S. government can use other methods. Since the United States intends to provide assistance, there are many ways to do so. Our country only seeks to achieve the goal of obtaining loans, and all other methods are welcome. When asked about his views on the current Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, Wang said: Because the international situation is too complicated, it is impossible to make predictions at the beginning of the meeting. But logically, the Soviet Union may conditionally accept Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for Europe.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Adjourn Soon; President and Members Host Banquets for Each Other</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] With the Legislative Yuan to adjourn soon, all the members and Vice Presidents Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng hosted banquets twice on the 28th, at noon and in the evening. Sun and Wu hosted the noon banquet, with 151 attendees, including all senior staff of the Legislative Yuan. In the evening, all the members returned the favor at the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse. The Yuan will hold its last meeting on the 3rd of next month and then adjourn for two months, so the atmosphere at today's banquet was very pleasant. President Sun said in his speech at the noon banquet that the Legislative Yuan's past achievements, especially the constitutional laws and regulations, were completed in the shortest possible time, which helped to implement the constitution as scheduled and is truly admirable. Sun pointed out that after the Legislative Yuan's organization expanded, the newly elected members and the original members met in one place, and although they argued over proposals, they were harmonious and agreeable outside the meeting, which fully demonstrates that they have a democratic spirit. This is the most precious thing. He also mentioned that after the last meeting next week, some members have not returned to their hometowns for many years, and he hoped that they could all return home to participate in the election. Sun then introduced Wu Tiecheng, saying: "Vice President Wu used to hold important positions within the Kuomintang and served as the convener of the Nomination Committee. In the future Legislative Yuan elections, regardless of whether they are Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, Youth Party, or social elites, Vice President Wu will definitely be able to assist." Wu Tiecheng also gave a speech on the spot. He mentioned that he had served as a member of the Legislative Yuan 15 years ago, saying that now it is like returning home. Wu said that he was impressed by the past achievements of the Legislative Yuan and expressed his willingness to work together with all the members to complete the legislative cases that should be amended and formulated before the implementation of the constitution as soon as possible. Committee Member Liu Jianshun then delivered a reply on behalf of the members, expressing gratitude for the praise of Sun and Wu, and expressed his willingness to continue to work hard to complete the great cause of constitutional government.</p>
<h3>Unmarked Aircraft Bomb Ning County, Gansu Province</h3>
<p>Twenty-eight Bombs Dropped; Significant Losses</p>
<p>[China Historical News Agency, Lanzhou, 28th] Xifeng Town, 27th: At 1 p.m. on the 22nd, an unmarked bomber suddenly appeared over Ning County. After circling once, it indiscriminately bombed the urban area, dropping 28 bombs, killing three people, injuring four, and causing particularly heavy damage to houses and equipment.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Stuart Arrives in Beiping by Plane: After Presiding Over Yanjing University Graduation Ceremony, Returns to Nanjing; Believes That Although China's Problems Are Serious, They Are Not Hopeless</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] July 4th is the U.S. Independence Day. Ambassador Stuart Leighton will hold a reception at his residence from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the afternoon of that day to entertain diplomatic envoys from various countries, our leaders, and people from all walks of life. The Ambassador's Yanjing University graduation ceremony is about to be held. He will fly to Beiping with advisor Zhao Jingbo at 8 a.m. on the 28th to preside over it and will return to Nanjing on July 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Bureau, 28th] Ambassador Stuart arrived in Beiping by plane from Nanjing at 12:30 p.m. on the 28th. He returned to Yanjing University. The reporter approached him at Linhu Xuan. The Ambassador said: (1) China's usage plan is not yet final. Although the deadline for the $500 million loan is approaching, the funds can still be reserved. China can submit another usage plan. This will not disappear due to the expiration of the 30th. (2) The United States is constantly paying close attention to the Northeast and Baitashan incidents. However, as a whole, international issues are considered to be no more than internal Chinese problems. If China's internal affairs are sound, there will be no foreign troubles. (3) Regarding the issue between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I hope there can be another negotiation to give a final chance for peace. He believes that whoever wins between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party depends on the support of the people's united strength. He personally believes that the government can still have a way to win the support of the people. (4) Although China's current problems are extremely serious, they are not hopeless. This depends on how the strength of the Chinese people's unity is brought into play. The Ambassador decided to return to Nanjing on the 2nd after attending the Yanjing University graduation ceremony.</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Procuratorate Issues Order to Arrest Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The Supreme Court Procuratorate has recently ordered the Chief Procurators of all Higher Courts in the country to order their subordinates to strictly arrest Mao Zedong. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The case is based on a report from Ye Zaizhou, President of the Gansu Higher Court, and Zhan Shiming, Chief Procurator, stating that Wang Zuozhu, Speaker of the Cheng County Council, and others, reported that Mao Zedong is using troops to incite rebellion. Please punish him according to the law to appease public anger, etc. Based on this, it is appropriate to report to your superior for review. After investigation, the rebel Mao Zedong has seized the country's land, used troops to rebel, harmed the country and the people, and his crimes are heinous. He should be arrested and dealt with according to the law. In addition to issuing separate orders, you are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates to strictly arrest him and bring him to justice to uphold the law. This order.</p>
<h3>Number of Additional Legislative Yuan Seats Increased: Total of Eighty-Four; Legislative Yuan Passes After Heated Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] The Legislative Yuan held its 330th routine meeting on the morning of the 28th, spending the entire time discussing various laws and regulations related to the implementation of the constitution and the allocation table for the number of additional Legislative Yuan seats. Today's meeting was chaired by concurrent President Sun Ke, with more than 80 members present. The first issue discussed was the number of additional Legislative Yuan seats. After two hours of heated debate, it was resolved to increase the number of additional seats from 56 to 84. Then, the Legislative Yuan discussed the distribution table for additional Legislative Yuan seats. According to the original table of 56 seats, agricultural and fishery groups could get 18 seats, industrial groups 12 seats, commercial groups 3 seats, industrial and mining groups 5 seats, educational groups 11 seats, and free professional groups 7 seats. Now that the total number has been changed to 84, the number of seats for each industry should be increased proportionally. However, Deng Hongye believes that the number of seats occupied by fishery groups is too large. There are people in northern China who have never tasted fish in their lives. This provision may increase the opportunity for so-called fishery companies in Shanghai and Tianjin to "pass off imitation goods as genuine." Jian Guansan also pointed out that we have only heard of building a country based on agriculture, building a country based on industry, but we have never heard of building a country based on fishery. How can fishery representatives represent the people of the north who have been eating rice and fresh fish for thousands of years? Jian suggested that it would be better to increase the number of representatives of free professions than to increase the number of fishery representatives. Zhang Huai also advocated increasing the number of free professional representatives. Finally, it was decided to return the matter to the committee for review. The division of legislative electoral districts for people residing abroad and the allocation table for the number of members to be elected in each district were slightly amended and passed.</p>
<p>The allocation table for the number of National Assembly seats for professional groups was also one of the cases passed at today's meeting. According to the regulations, there are a total of 450 National Assembly seats for professional representatives. Agricultural and fishery groups account for 32%, or 144 seats, of which 134 seats are for agricultural representatives and 10 seats are for fishery representatives. Workers' groups account for 28%, or 126 seats. Industrial and commercial groups account for 17%, commercial groups account for 3%, or 13 seats. Industrial and mining groups account for 4%, or 18 seats. Educational groups account for 20%, 90 seats. Free professional groups account for 13%, 59 seats. Among the above 450 seats, women representatives account for 72 seats. The detailed allocation method will be determined by the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>The allocation table for the number of National Assembly representatives for women's groups was also discussed at the meeting. Committee Members Zhao Maohua, Chuan Yan, and others spoke up. Peng Zuishi, using his status as "not a woman," argued for his native Jiangxi. Some members of the Legislative Yuan expressed doubts about the women's groups established in various places. It was later decided to return the table to the committee for review.</p>
<p>The original regulations for the number of signatures required for candidates for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan members from overseas Chinese were too high. The Overseas Department requested that they be reduced. There was not much disagreement in the meeting when this case was discussed today. Later, it was decided to reduce the number of signatures required for Legislative Yuan members from overseas Chinese to 500, and the number of signatures required for Legislative Yuan members to 200. At that time, someone mentioned the issue of political party nominations. Concurrent President Sun Ke instructed that parties participating in the constitutional government can propose nominations. It has not yet been decided whether other parties can nominate.</p>
<p>Finally, the two cases of amending the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law and increasing the number of Legislative Yuan seats for Tibet were discussed. The former was resolved not to be amended for the time being, and the latter was returned to the committee for review. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 p.m. The next routine meeting is scheduled to be held on July 3rd. That meeting may be the last routine meeting of the current Legislative Yuan.

<h3>Secretariat of the National Political Council Issues Statement</h3>
<p>United Press Report Inaccurate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, stated to a reporter from the Central News Agency on the 28th: "Regarding the foreign affairs report and questioning at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Council on the 27th, the report published by the United Press yesterday differed greatly in content from the words reported and answered by Minister Wang Shijie at the time. The Secretariat has a responsibility to issue a statement through your agency to avoid misunderstandings."</p>
<h3>A Lively Debate in the Legislative Yuan: Each Expressing Their Views on the Issue of Increasing Seats</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The long-pending issue of increasing the number of seats for occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan was once again brought up at today's regular meeting, resulting in an unprecedentedly heated debate. Over two hours, nearly all of the eighty-odd legislators, with only a few exceptions, rose to speak, at one point almost reaching a deadlock. Thanks to President Sun Ke's two earnest explanations, it was finally decided to reduce the number from 112 to 84, which is still a 50% increase over the original 56 seats.</p>
<p>This dispute has been ongoing for some time. Its most recent resurgence stems from the fifth meeting of the State Council, which resolved that "the number of seats for occupational elections in the Legislative Yuan be increased to 112, and the Legislative Yuan be instructed to amend the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators." When the case was submitted to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee for review, it was generally agreed that the total number of legislators, already exceeding 700, would be excessive if increased further, and it was resolved that "no amendment is necessary." After Committee Chairman Liu Kejun explained the review process to the general assembly, the heated debate ensued.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Haicheng raised the "issue of legislative principles," arguing that the Legislative Yuan should not make decisions that contradict the principles of the National Government, nor should it place itself in a confrontational position with the National Government.</p>
<p>President Sun Ke spoke, urging legislators not to insist.</p>
<p>Liu Butong, the strongest opponent of increasing occupational representatives, immediately rebutted Chen's remarks, pointing out that the original proposal submitted by the State Council did not explain what difficulties would arise if the number of occupational representatives was not increased, but merely stipulated an increase to 112 seats, which he considered too vague.</p>
<p>At this point, President Sun Ke, in his capacity as a State Councilor, refuted Liu's argument, stating that the National Government is the parent body of the Legislative Yuan and, in principle, has absolute binding authority over the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan's decision to "make no amendment" to the principles submitted by the State Council is a violation of the system and is, in fact, illegal. Some might consider it an act of rebellion by the Legislative Yuan. Legally speaking, the current Legislative Yuan is not the Legislative Yuan of the constitutional era and cannot regard itself as supreme. He hoped that all legislators would reconsider the proposal and voice any opinions they may have, but that they should not reject it outright.</p>
<p>Zhou Yizhi, another staunch opponent of increasing the number of occupational representatives, rose to speak, offering two suggestions: (1) The Legislative Yuan need not take responsibility for future generations on this matter. Since the National Government wishes to increase the number of occupational representatives, this case can be left for the National Government to decide on its own, selecting as many as it desires. (2) The Legislative Yuan should present a record of past meetings opposing the increase in the number of occupational representatives, along with the reasons for opposing it, and request the National Government to provide clear instructions based on these reasons. Tan Tiwu pointed out that if the National Government is supreme, it should be supreme not only over the Legislative Yuan but also over the entire nation. Why does the state not value the opinions of the Legislative Yuan but only pay attention to certain occupational groups? It should not disregard the dignity of the legislature to satisfy the needs of a small group of people. If coercive measures are necessary, the National Government can act unilaterally. The National Government's actions on this matter must be considered ill-considered. Lu Fu reiterated his consistent stance, firmly opposing the increase in seats, and cited the Constitution, stating that all people are completely equal before the law and in elections. There are only slightly over 800 members of occupational organizations nationwide. Based on the Legislative Yuan's stipulated 56 seats, their proportion is already much more favorable than that of regional representatives. If it is further increased to 112, the unreasonableness and unfairness will be even greater, a situation rarely seen in any country in the world.</p>
<p>Wang Shizeng, a minority party legislator who rarely speaks, also rose to speak. Wang pointed out that occupational groups have been using all means of persuasion and intimidation to secure seats in the Legislative Yuan. This tactic has been applied not only to the Legislative Yuan but also to the National Government. If this continues, will not the entire national policy be swayed by them?</p>
<p>Tong Kunsun, who supports the increase in the number of occupational representatives, raised three points: system, organization, and hierarchy, hoping that they would not be overly rigid. By this point, the discussion had lasted nearly two hours, and many legislators continued to speak. Based on the situation at the time, further discussion over several days would not lead to any concrete decision. President Sun Ke rose again to speak, in order to break the deadlock. Sun first pointed out that although this issue has been repeatedly delayed, when the State Council discussed this case, frankly speaking, most of the committee members did not pay much attention to it. The reason for stipulating 112 seats was merely based on doubling the original 56 seats. The initial intention was to assist the Legislative Yuan in resolving this issue. The main reason for opposing the increase in the number of occupational representatives is the deep fear of manipulation by Shanghai financial groups. However, according to the distribution list of legislators for occupational representatives, commercial groups only get three of the 56 seats, and industrial and mining groups only get five. Even if doubled, the number would only be six and ten, respectively, a very small proportion. We should pay attention to whether the representatives produced in the future are genuinely practitioners of their respective industries, and there is no need to worry too much about other things.</p>
<p>A Vote is Finally Held and Passed by a Majority</p>
<p>Sun's speech was met with enthusiastic applause from the entire body. Immediately following, a vote was held and passed by a large majority. It was decided to increase the number of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan from 56 to 84.</p>

<h3>Guangdong People in Beijing Petition for Swift Allocation of Funds for Flood Relief, Guangdong People in Shanghai Host Reporters to Report on the Disaster</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Guangdong people in Beijing, in order to appeal for relief for the Guangdong floods, sent representatives Zhang Meng, Li Jiamian, Wang Shangyi, and others totaling eleven people to the Senate, the National Government, and the Executive Yuan on the 27th to urge the swift allocation of large sums of money to carry out emergency relief. Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the Senate received them, Military Counselor Xue Yue of the National Government received them, and Secretary-General Gan received them at the Executive Yuan. After listening to the disaster reports from the representatives, they all expressed extreme concern and promised to forward the disaster situation to Chairman Chiang and President Zhang as soon as possible and to allocate relief funds quickly.</p>
<p>[Local News] The floods in Guangdong Province this time are a disaster rarely seen in decades. Guangdong people in Shanghai are extremely concerned. Mr. Xie Hanguang, the head of the Shanghai Broadcasting Office, hosted the press yesterday at the Guanshengyuan Restaurant, with over forty reporters from various newspapers attending. Xie reported on the disaster situation, saying that the Guangdong Association and the Guangzhao Association, along with their directors and supervisors, have also begun to raise funds separately, and have already raised over 700 million yuan. In addition, many Guangdong businessmen have launched charity sales to raise funds, and Guangdong opera star Guan Dexing also performed a charity performance last night, with all ticket sales going to Guangdong for emergency relief, etc. Huang Guanghua then reported, saying: This year's floods in Guangdong Province are due to the fact that the Japanese invaders set up many obstacles in various rivers during their occupation, coupled with years of silt accumulation that has not been dredged. Now, after months of snow and rain, the Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Hanjiang rivers have all surged, eventually leading to the destruction of fields and homes. Most importantly, the "Shijiaoyuan" in Qingyuan has collapsed twice. The first time was about ten feet, and thousands of people worked together to rescue it and quickly blocked it. The second time was about seven or eight days. At that time, there was a lack of rescue tools, and the villagers automatically dismantled several ancestral halls to use as needed to block the breach, which was blocked again after an hour. Otherwise, if the embankment had breached, the extent of the disaster would have been unimaginable. In the Dongjiang and Beijiang areas, the water reached the roofs of lower-lying areas, and was also several feet deep in higher areas. Fortunately, the weather has been sunny for several days, and the floodwaters have receded slightly. As for Guangzhou City, the water in the lower-lying areas of "Xiguan" and "Henan" was several feet deep, and the water on Changdi Road was also several inches deep. Currently, the water level is gradually decreasing. According to a report from the Water Conservancy Bureau, the water level of the Pearl River has dropped by more than four feet. If the weather continues to be sunny, the water levels of the rivers may not rise again.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Pays Attention to Unsound Banks in Shanghai. Orders Datong Bank to Suspend Business for Liquidation. Revokes the Beijing and Chongqing Offices of Xikang Provincial Bank.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the rectification of the Shanghai financial market. Following the suspension of exchange and revocation of license of Jianghai Bank, the ministry is paying particularly close attention to banks with unsound operations. It is learned that the Datong Commercial Bank on Beijing East Road in Shanghai was previously penalized by the Ministry of Finance for violating regulations such as poor management, fraudulent promissory notes, and failure to pay reserves. Recently, the bank was found to have concentrated most of its capital in securities speculation, and still has a large number of fraudulent promissory notes not listed in the accounts. Furthermore, the bank's personnel organization is also unsound. The Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to investigate and found that the bank has violated various regulations of the Ministry of Finance's management of banks. The Ministry of Finance has ordered the bank to suspend business for liquidation in accordance with the law, and has also imposed a penalty of revoking its license. Furthermore, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance previously received reports that the operations of the Nanjing and Chongqing offices of the Xikang Provincial Bank were largely non-compliant, and that their personnel organizations had little connection with the head office. After sending personnel to thoroughly investigate, it was reported that the personnel, expenses, and operations of the two offices were indeed independent systems. The head office also admitted that these two institutions were established by Tian Nong and others who fraudulently used the name, deceiving the government and submitting a request for establishment to the Ministry of Finance. After learning of this, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the two offices to be revoked. In Shanghai, the bank has also been ordered to temporarily suspend participation in the Provincial Bank Joint Remittance Office organization. The ministry has also separately sent a letter to the Xikang Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation and improvement of the bank's operations.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices in Kang Province Skyrocket. Authorities Allocate Accumulated Grain for Sale.</h3>

<h3>Striving to Build an Economic Breakwater: Prices in Taiwan Province Tend to Stabilize. Wei Daoming Expresses Hope for Foreign Investment.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 28th] Chairman Wei met with our newspaper's reporter alone at 11:00 AM today. He said that he is currently striving to build an economic breakwater to stabilize the value of the Taiwan dollar. The inflow of funds is under control, and the exchange rate is adjusted at any time, which has been enthusiastically supported by the people of the province, so that prices have not risen as sharply as in Shanghai. The reorganization of the Monopoly Bureau does not affect finance, and the province's revenue and expenditure remain balanced. Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, he said that countermeasures are currently being considered and must be submitted to the central government for decision. Regarding the unemployment problem, he said that fellow compatriots and people on the mainland have the same character, that is, they want face. The relief plan for 260,000 people to reclaim wasteland has been decided to be implemented. Technicians will be placed separately and given civil engineering and mechanical training to form engineering teams. He hopes that the people of the province will actively register. He absolutely does not want a few capitalists to manipulate the industry and commerce of Taiwan Province. Large-scale factories will be handed over to private operation so that ordinary people can buy shares, and small-scale factories will be auctioned off. This province is a province with a production environment. He hopes for foreign investment in enterprises, and speculation and buying and selling are not welcome. Proper commercial exchanges are also enough to enhance the feelings between people inside and outside the province. He also plans to tour the province at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Favors the Japanese Textile Industry. The China Textile Institute Lodges a Protest.</h3>
<p>[This City News] The China Textile Institute protested against MacArthur's favoring of the Japanese textile industry, not allowing it to be included in the list of reparations and demolition, and repeatedly protecting it, so that the Japanese textile industry is rapidly recovering, which is actually a step towards the resurgence of Japan. The general assembly of the association unanimously decided to lodge a protest with MacArthur. The protest letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To the Far Eastern Commission of the United Nations Reparations Commission, transferred to MacArthur for consideration: Your Excellency commands the three armies and conquers strong enemies. Your great achievements are admired by the world. Now, all the political, military, economic, and educational policies in Japan are in accordance with your orders. The Chinese people believe that Your Excellency, witnessing the brutality of the invaders, will be able to make thorough plans to make the invaders surrender forever and unable to rise again. Who knows that the news came that Your Excellency's measures towards Japan are excessively generous, and the special protection given to the Japanese textile industry is even more so. Your Excellency believes that the Japanese textile industry is not comparable to the military industry and cannot be listed as reparations, and that the existing 2.8 million spindles in Japan are not enough and plan to expand it to 6 million spindles, which will not only be used to maintain the needs of its own country, but also encourage exports to compete for the international trade market. Therefore, the Chinese government's request to reduce the Japanese textile industry has been ignored. This association is a Chinese people's organization and is organized by textile industry practitioners. We have had a lot of contact with Japan and have a deeper understanding of the textile industry. We believe that the above-mentioned measures are enough to threaten the survival of China—America's ally—and promote the future aggression of Japan—America's enemy. We have to raise Your Excellency's awareness and state the reasons as follows: (1) Japan has a population of 70 million. Calculating 20 yards of cotton cloth per person per year, at most 1.3 million to 1.5 million spindles can supply it with surplus. Japan's existing spindles have exceeded the limit required for self-supply. If it is said that it must rely on cotton exports to exchange for food and other necessities, is that really the case? It has been found that Japan produces a large amount of silk, tea, and other products, and the export volume is huge, which can be used as a regulating material, and there is no need for cotton goods made by spinning machines. (2) Japan is the culprit of this war. It dares to act willfully because it relies on its military equipment. The foundation of military equipment lies in industry, but the development of Japanese industry is more dependent on the textile industry. Before the war, the sale of cheap Japanese textile products was not only widespread in East Asia and Southeast Asia, but also extended to Western Europe and South America. The surging momentum is still frightening to think about it, and the Japanese use their surplus to build military industries. Therefore, to weaken Japan's military preparedness, it is necessary to weaken its economic sources, and restricting its textile industry beyond the required limit is one of the best ways. (3) To prevent Japan from rising again and invading, it must rely on neighboring countries to monitor it. The Allied countries' control over Japan cannot be extended indefinitely. China and Japan are neighbors. They can supervise Japan's actions at any time. Moreover, China will be particularly concerned about all its measures. (4) This war was launched in Japan, and the first to bear the brunt was China. In total, the war of resistance lasted for eight years, and the sacrifices were heavy. Everything needed for food, clothing, housing, and transportation should be actively replenished to save the people from fire and water. Dismantling Japan's surplus textile industry equipment in China is an appropriate and fair move. (5) The textile industry is a civilian industry in peacetime, but it becomes a military industry in wartime. Just think, how can millions of troops carry out operations without clothing and equipment? As for those that directly supply military use, such as the tents of ships and vehicles, the wings of airplanes, the parachutes that land, and the bandages and gauze used to treat the wounded, almost none of them are not textile products. Dismantling the textile equipment beyond the minimum limit for civilian use is a powerful measure to deprive its military potential. Is there any doubt about it? The above is just a general outline. There are many other reasons that cannot be enumerated one by one. For the sake of permanent peace in East Asia and permanent peace in the Pacific, we dare not tell you sincerely what we think is dangerous. If you adopt our humble opinion and correct it in time, it will not be too late.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Beginning of the United States' New Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>The US State Department announced on the 27th that the US government has signed a contract with the Chinese government to allow China to purchase US surplus military equipment worth 650,000 US dollars; at the same time, Martin, the president of the US Export-Import Bank, is still considering granting new loans to China, and will divide the nature of the loans into four categories: (1) Loans to promote US import and export trade; (2) Loans to subsidize and encourage private capital without competing with it; (3) Loans with special purposes; (4) Loans decided by the board of directors. These two pieces of news spread to China, sweeping away all the factors that seemed to cause controversy between China and the United States these days.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned batch of surplus military equipment was leased to China during the war, selling it to China at this time, no matter how much the quantity is, the significance is self-evident. United Press reporter Shackford telegraphed: The United States' sale of surplus military equipment to China can be regarded as the United States abandoning its neutral policy adopted since Marshal Marshall went to China in 1945 to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for 18 months. As for the loan issue, the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan, which is being held in reserve, will mostly no longer be extended by the 30th of this month, which will inevitably disappoint the Chinese people, but the United States has stated that it will not stop providing economic assistance to China, and on the contrary, the US economic aid to China plan will be implemented soon, whether it is a long-term loan to promote China's economic recovery or a short-term loan to stabilize China's current economic situation, as long as the Chinese government puts forward a "special plan" and "guarantees debt repayment," the United States has the possibility of granting it to China.</p>
<p>In the past few days, our newspaper has published three or four editorials one after another, repeatedly stating our belief that far-sighted politicians in the United States will be able to make new decisions on the increasingly critical situation in the Far East. We have seen the above-mentioned two pieces of news from Washington, which makes us more believe that the United States is not short of far-sighted politicians, and that the United States has begun to make new decisions on China.</p>
<p>The diplomatic relations between ordinary two countries depend half on the relationship of interests and half on the historical relationship. From a distance, the United States has always been our country's friendly country, and the relations between the two countries are very friendly and close. The United States has no territorial and political ambitions for China and has used the principles of "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity" to maintain the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, which everyone has long known. During the war of resistance, the United States not only sympathized with China's arduous war in spirit, but also provided continuous material assistance to China. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, China and the United States became allies in adversity. After the victory, the United States sent Marshal Ma to China to mediate the Chinese Communist Party issue. Although it is inevitable that the observation was not in the middle of the country, his sincerity in seeking peace and unity for China is really touching. Therefore, from the perspective of the development of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the United States' policy toward China has always been consistent, that is, it hopes that there will be a peaceful, unified, democratic, and powerful new China in the Far East, which will be a stabilizing force for world peace.</p>
<p>Marshal Ma's farewell remarks when he left China and returned to the country are still deeply imprinted in the hearts of all Chinese people. Unfortunately, Marshal Ma's good intentions were ultimately obstructed by the Chinese Communist Party's stubbornness and failed to fully meet the wishes of the people to turn hostility into friendship. Marshal Ma must also be very clear and sympathetic about the difficulties of the Chinese government's situation. Logically, there should be no misunderstandings or illusions between China and the United States, and controversies such as who abandoned whom or whether the United States will withdraw from the Far East are even more unnecessary. Sooner or later, the haze will be dispelled by the sun.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the relationship between China and the United States has its historical origin, and the United States will be able to make new decisions on China that meet the needs of the times. But what we should focus on is that China must have a democratic and strong government of its own, determine the policies needed by the people, and resolutely implement them regardless of everything with the support of the people, so that China can truly become a nation with national independence, the development of civil rights, and the well-being of the people under the National Government. Then the assistance of any friendly country will be abundant, not just the United States? "God helps those who help themselves!" On the day when the United States adopted a new policy, we must work harder and strengthen ourselves.</p>
<h3>A Major Key to World Division and Unity</h3>
<p>The foreign ministers of England, France, and the Soviet Union held their first meeting on the 27th at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the European economic aid plan proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall. Although the details of the meeting were kept strictly confidential, observers noted that the atmosphere was filled with harmony and cooperation, and it is expected that the three foreign ministers will be able to agree on a plan for the reconstruction of Europe. People all over the world must attach great importance to this meeting, because the future division and unity of the world can be glimpsed from its outcome.</p>
<p>The unpleasant ending of the last Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference gave the world a very bad impression, almost making everyone feel that true peace was moving further away from us. Subsequently, the United States announced the Truman Doctrine, not hesitating to lend huge sums to Greece and Turkey, which were threatened by foreign aggression; on the Soviet side, it intensified its efforts in the Balkans, causing the coup in Hungary and putting Bulgaria and Romania in precarious situations. No matter from which perspective one observes, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed causing people to feel increasingly tense. If this situation is not remedied, not only will European countries fall into a tragic fate, but also the catastrophe of mankind may be inevitable. Secretary of State Marshall, aware of this, made a final appeal for world peace and human happiness. In a speech delivered at Harvard University on the 5th of this month, Marshal Marshall proposed a US economic aid plan for Europe, roughly stating that "European countries should unite and carry out large-scale reconstruction work together, and the United States will do its best to assist them"; and that "in the next three or four years, Europe must obtain more assistance, otherwise it will cause political and economic collapse, so the United States must do its best to promote European economic recovery, without economic recovery, political stability is impossible, and without political stability, there is no peace to speak of."</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall's speech on aid to Europe immediately aroused the excitement and excitement of people in various European countries, and everyone believed that the European haze after the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference might reveal a ray of sunshine from here. In particular, Marshall also included the Soviet Union in the scope of the US aid plan for Europe, which added a new factor to breaking the European stalemate.</p>
<p>Following Marshal Marshall's speech, the British and French authorities decided to invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Paris in the name of the British and French foreign ministers to hold a meeting to discuss the US aid plan for Europe. Although the Soviet government initially remained silent, and public opinion criticized Marshal Marshall's attempt to use his dollars to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, it seemed unwilling to participate in the consultation. However, Marshall's aid plan for Europe is ultimately beyond reproach. Republican presidential candidate Stassen also agreed that the United States should provide substantial assistance to European war-stricken countries within the next ten years. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden praised Marshall's aid plan for Europe as the greatest gift from the United States, which is enough to bring new hope to Europe and the world. Moreover, all parties in other European countries unanimously expressed their willingness to cooperate fully to promote the implementation of this plan. Seeing the reaction of various European countries, the Soviet Union finally issued a communique on the 23rd, accepting the invitation of the British and French foreign ministers to participate in the three-nation foreign ministers meeting and suggested that it be held in Paris on the 27th to discuss Marshall's aid plan for Europe.</p>
<p>This major announcement by the Soviet Union made the United Kingdom, France, and Eastern European countries express their gratification. Although it cannot be immediately concluded that the three-nation foreign ministers meeting will be successful, the possibility of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries to jointly rebuild Europe has ultimately increased. This is not only a celebration for Europe but also a celebration for the world. The peace-loving Chinese people will surely place greater expectations on it. As long as contemporary politicians and diplomats can use their political wisdom, look at the situation from a long-term perspective, think from a broad perspective, eliminate international suspicion and misunderstanding, and restore the spirit of wartime allies sharing weal and woe as much as possible, and use the perseverance of fighting for victory during the war to create world peace, then the current world situation can be changed immediately. Therefore, we believe that although the three-nation foreign ministers meeting is discussing the US aid plan for Europe, it is actually a major key to world division and unity.</p>
<p>According to reports from various news agencies, the four powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have their own calculations for the aid plan for Europe, and their opinions are not entirely the same. For example, the United States first wants European countries to reach an agreement on their basic needs and establish an appropriate foundation before applying for assistance from the United States; the United Kingdom is deeply concerned that the Soviet Union will demand too much assistance from the United States, so it advocates that the British and American occupation zones in Germany should enjoy priority, but this proposal cannot be agreed to by France and the Soviet Union; as for the Soviet Union, it advocates that European countries whose economic difficulties are caused by German aggression should first obtain assistance from the United States. These differences of opinion are enough to hinder the progress of the three-nation foreign ministers meeting, but as long as the three foreign ministers can discuss with an open mind, without prejudice, and put the interests of the entire Europe above their individual interests, and draft a practical and feasible plan for the reconstruction of Europe, then these divergent opinions will not be difficult to resolve. Although China is not a member of Europe, peace is indivisible, so its hope for the success of Marshall's aid plan for Europe, which is related to the future division and unity of the world, is no less than that of any European country.</p>

<h3>US Representative Sternly Condemns Aggressive Actions of Three Neighboring Countries of Greece and Suggests Establishing a Committee to Monitor the Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 27th] US Representative Austin, at the start of the Security Council's discussion of the report of the Balkan Investigation Committee, issued a warning, stating that if Greece's northern neighbors continue to violate Greece's borders, the Security Council will have to adopt "enforcement measures" (according to the UN Charter, enforcement measures include various measures ranging from economic blockade to military intervention). Austin also suggested establishing a permanent UN committee to monitor Greece's northern border.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 27th] US Representative to the UN Security Council, Austin, declared at the council meeting on the 27th that if actions against the independence of Greece continue, world peace will be subjected to a more serious threat. The assistance of Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia to guerrilla warfare is tantamount to actual aggression by regular troops. The Balkan guerrilla war has become one of the most serious cases under the UN organization, and the future of the UN depends on how to resolve this case. The Security Council should immediately accept all the recommendations of the Balkan Investigation Committee, including the organization of a Balkan border committee proposed by the United States to patrol the disputed southeastern European border. Austin also formally suggested that the committee be organized by the eleven member states of the Security Council, and its first term should end in August 1949.</p>
<p>After Austin's speech, Dendramis immediately supported it, saying that it is necessary to take swift action to rescue Greece from communist dictatorship. At this Security Council meeting, the three countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, as well as Greece, were also invited to attend. Representatives of Bulgaria and Albania denied the accusations against Greece. The Bulgarian representative said that the country had never trained a single guerrilla. This case may require several weeks of debate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] The United States and the Soviet Union have been avoiding vetoes in the UN Security Council for a long time, but now the Balkan issue may become a reality. After US Chief Representative Austin yesterday accused the three countries of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria of violating some of the basic principles of the UN Charter, most representatives today believe that the primary issue is whether the Soviet Union will support its satellite countries, and when the case of establishing a fact-finding mission permanently stationed in the Balkans to monitor the situation for two years is put to a vote, it will definitely cause a crisis. The three countries, including Yugoslavia, have stated that they are unwilling to allow UN investigators to freely enter and leave their borders.</p>
<h3>Three Foreign Ministers Hold Second Meeting to Discuss Principles of European Reconstruction. Meeting Kept Strictly Secret at UK's Request.</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: The three foreign ministers held their second meeting at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs starting at 3 pm today. Although the news blockade is extremely strict, the "Parisian" newspaper said that Molotov has a very detailed proposal, which has been discussed at the first foreign ministers meeting. According to reliable sources, the three foreign ministers are trying their best to grasp the basic principles of economic reconstruction. Bidault proposed that all United Nations members, neutral countries, or former enemy countries that participated in the war, except Spain, should be included in the scope of the reconstruction plan.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: Bidault said at the first meeting of the three foreign ministers that accepting the Marshall Plan should be carried out from a distance, and suggested that September 1 be the deadline for preparing the European reconstruction plan. Molotov opposed hasty action, advocating that the Marshall Plan should be studied in detail, and suggested that the future of Germany and Soviet compensation be resolved first. However, according to TASS telegram, Molotov suggested that the United States should obtain guarantees as the first step in the meeting.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Although the meeting of the foreign ministers of England, the Soviet Union, and France is kept strictly secret, according to reliable sources, the three foreign ministers began to discuss Marshall's aid plan for Europe immediately after holding the first meeting at 4 pm today. The meeting today began at 4 pm, chaired by French Foreign Minister Bidault. It is said that the atmosphere at the meeting was quite serious. According to well-informed sources, the three foreign ministers may have discussed the various subtle issues raised by the US proposal. French Foreign Minister Bidault, accompanied by Foreign Secretary Mueville, Director of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arlphonse, and Monnet, the drafter of the French four-year reconstruction plan, arrived first. After a while, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, accompanied by British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper, Sir Dixon Hall Patch, and Wallace, arrived. Foreign Minister Molotov was the last to arrive, followed by Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, four experts, and one English-French interpreter each. The three-nation foreign ministers meeting adjourned at 8:10 pm, and no statement was issued afterward. It is believed that the three foreign ministers will meet again tomorrow afternoon. Foreign Minister Molotov left first at 8:04 pm, and Foreign Secretary Bevin left the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 8:15 pm with Ambassador Duff Cooper and consultants. Because the three foreign ministers kept the meeting strictly secret, the press conference originally scheduled for 7 pm was also temporarily cancelled, and it is feared that no statement will be issued tonight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It is reported that the strict secrecy of the talks was proposed by Bevin. In fact, France had expressed opposition. France had originally scheduled a press conference last night, which was cancelled about an hour after the three foreign ministers began their talks. France was very surprised by Bevin's proposal, so it is still doubtful whether France is willing to keep the secret throughout the meeting. The attitude of the Soviet delegation is still unknown. However, from the time the Soviet representatives arrived at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the meeting until they left the venue after the meeting adjourned, they did not say a word outside the meeting room, which was the opposite of the attitude of the British delegation. Moreover, the faces of the members of the Soviet delegation were expressionless and without the slightest smile, so it was absolutely impossible to guess whether they were happy or not. The outside world can only speculate on the process of this meeting. If the three foreign ministers keep the secret throughout and announce it only after the meeting is over, then the results of the meeting will not be known until Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper's Tone Towards Marshall Plan Slightly Softer Than Before</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 27th] The "New Times" weekly published an editorial today, which is the most optimistic response from the Soviet Union recently to the Marshall Plan, roughly stating: If the Marshall Plan is an economic measure to restore commerce and has no intention of supplementing the Truman Doctrine, then all European countries will "undoubtedly" support it. Of course, no democratic country in Europe can accept the loan conditions imposed on Turkey and Greece by the Truman Doctrine. How can this be called true economic assistance? In view of the fact that supporters of the Western bloc are clearly planning to accept the Marshall Plan, it is currently difficult to judge to what extent the plan can achieve in the future. The original text of Marshall's outline of the plan at Harvard University and British Foreign Secretary Bevin's explanation in the House of Commons have very vague meanings.</p>
<h3>United States Demands Soviet Union Pay a Heavy Price</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] According to authoritative sources, if the Soviet Union participates in the European reconstruction plan, it must open up the economic "curtain" of Eastern Europe and allow Eastern European countries to restore normal commercial relations with Western Europe. This may be the main "price" that the United States demands for participating in any aid plan that includes the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite countries. Some US officials admit that the price paid by the Soviet Union is quite high, or too high.</p>

Clayton is still in London and is scheduled to go to the European continent this weekend. The US Embassy said that it has not yet learned when Clayton will leave or where he will go. Clayton himself still refuses to meet with reporters.</p>
<h3>Stassen Advocates US Participation in Paris Conference</h3>
<p>And Suggests Stopping the Shipment of Goods to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Stassen, who is expected to be the Republican Party's next presidential candidate, broadcast yesterday, advocating that the United States participate in the Paris Conference and stop the shipment of oil and goods to the Soviet Union. Stassen said: "We should immediately participate in the Paris Conference so that our country and the United Kingdom can act together in the Ruhr area to revive the poor and sick residents of that area." Stassen advocated stopping the shipment of industrial products to the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union has repeatedly violated the Yalta Agreement. He believes that at least until the United States has a definite foreign policy, the shipment of oil and industrial products to the Soviet Union should be stopped.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 27th] New York architect Moses, on a secret mission from US Army Secretary Patterson, arrived here today. He refused to announce the nature of his mission.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hamburg, 27th] The German British Information Office said that Archbishop Spellman of New York sent a letter to Archbishop Frings of Cologne, saying that the US will vote to appropriate $50 million to the British and American occupation zones in Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] The premiers of the five states in the Soviet zone of Germany, and the ministers of the central zone political departments of trade, supply, fuel, electricity, transportation, and agriculture, held a secret meeting today at the headquarters of the Soviet military government. According to sources close to German and Soviet officials, the topic of discussion was to review and reorganize the economic and supply organizations in the Soviet zone. Two weeks ago, the Soviet side announced the establishment of a seven-member economic committee, because in the Soviet zone, the tasks of the state governments and the central zone government often overlap. The Soviet military government had previously urged the Germans to find ways to improve this situation, but the Soviet military government also stated that before a central government for all of Germany is possible, there is no need to take a final decision.</p>
<h3>British to Protest Japanese Mining on Palau Island</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Officials here were surprised to learn of MacArthur's decision to allow the Japanese to mine phosphate ore on the Palau Islands in the Pacific. According to responsible persons, the British government has not yet received a formal report, but if this news is officially confirmed, the United Kingdom will follow in the footsteps of Australia and lodge a protest with the United States. Australia has already announced that it will file a protest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 28th] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters explained today regarding the permission for Japan to mine phosphorus on Angaur Island in the Palau Islands, saying that the mining of phosphorus on Angaur Island has been going on for more than a year so that Japan can obtain fertilizer to increase food production, thereby reducing the burden on the United States for continuing to provide Japan with aid. This work was initially approved by the Washington International Joint Food Bureau, and a contract was concluded with a certain US company to mine on the island. After its funds ran out, Washington ordered MacArthur to take over this work, employing Japanese workers and using Japanese funds to mine phosphorus for the occupation of Japan. Angaur Island was captured by the US military and is now under US control, so the United States has the right to give priority to using the island's resources to meet the needs of the occupation of Japan.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 28th] Bodjonegoro, secretary of the Indonesian delegation to the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, arrived here today by train from Yogyakarta with a reply from Indonesian President Sukarno to the Netherlands, and immediately went to the Governor's Office of the Dutch East Indies to hand it over to Governor-General Van Mook. [Reuters, Batavia, 28th] The Indonesian News Agency said that an army spokesman said that he had intercepted an order from the commander of the Dutch East Indies army to launch an attack on the entire line at 6 am on Monday. A Dutch military spokesman in Batavia denied knowing about this. [Reuters, Yogyakarta, 27th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno has accepted today the main points listed in the Dutch note of May 27. His reply includes the concessions made by Sjahrir earlier, so it is expected that Sjahrir will be able to resume his position soon. Sukarno's decision to make concessions was made after leftist parties, including Indonesian representatives who had just returned from attending the International Federation of Trade Unions in Prague, urged him to abandon his opposition. It is understood that the main points of the reply include the following: (1) The interim federal government should be established as soon as possible; (2) The Republic no longer opposes the participation of a representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the interim federal government; (3) The first task of the interim government will be to establish a federal agency, as suggested by the Dutch, to form a police force; (4) The Republic government is prepared to maintain internal security; (5) The Republic government is prepared for general cooperation.</p>

<h3>US Concerned About Near East Oil Sources; Iran Considers Granting Oil Rights to USSR</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] Republican Senator Brewster told reporters last night that the Senate Defense Committee would soon investigate America's oil sources and reserves. America's intervention in Greece and Turkey aims to protect Arab oil sources, but to what extent the US will rely on these sources in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union is questionable. Brewster also announced the contents of a letter he received from Under Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, stating that Persia is an important source of additional kerosene for the US Navy. From July 1 this year, the US Navy will obtain an additional 1.5 million barrels of kerosene, which can offset defense needs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Montgomery, Alaska, USA, 27th] Iranian Air Force Minister Prince Firouz is currently inspecting airfields throughout the United States. It is said that Iran may grant oil rights to the Soviet Union, the same as those granted to Britain and the United States. A decision on this matter may be made within March.</p>
<h3>US Attaches Importance to Paris Conference; Hopes Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Will Submit Plans Soon; But the Power to Provide Economic Aid to Europe Rests with Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] As the Paris Tripartite Conference is held, President Truman has assured that senior US officials are unanimous in their views on undertaking the task of reviving Europe. According to official sources here: (1) There is currently no blueprint to consult regarding which of Europe's needs can be met independently and which require US assistance; (2) If the Paris Conference can reach an agreement, US officials sincerely hope that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can submit a detailed basis for a comprehensive European plan this summer; (3) If such a plan can be drafted by then, the United States will carefully study it, and the three committees recently established by the President will determine the tasks that can be undertaken based on America's ability to provide assistance.</p>
<p>US officials also agree that regardless of the plan formulated, the United States must continue to inject money into Europe in the next three to four years, otherwise, it will make the situation in Europe more chaotic and cause possible drastic setbacks domestically. However, the power over financial resources rests with Congress, so any promises must depend on congressional appropriations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The US government is paying close attention to the conference of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union being held in Paris, although it is not expressing great optimism. One of the main problems discussed by European leaders is the huge trade deficit of Eastern Hemisphere countries with US dollar bloc countries, which has become even more serious due to the figures released by the US Bureau of Statistics for May. The US's exports in that month have set a record high, while imports into the US from countries in dire need of US dollars have decreased by more than approximately $38 million. In that month, the value of relief and reconstruction materials exported by the US was $1.00396 billion, even higher than the amount during the most intense period of Lend-Lease aid, while the total amount of imports into the US was only $473.6 million, approximately $31.82 million less than the previous month. This state of imbalance threatens Europe with famine within a few months, and the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to treat this ailment. Since Marshall has stated, "This is a matter for Europe, and we should not interfere," the United States is not sending observers to the Paris conference. However, the United States attaches great importance to this conference. A senior US official said today: This meeting may be like other meetings held after the war, but it is not impossible for it to become a turning point in European history.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that although the United States is not participating in the Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference, it may put forward some suggestions that are in line with the concept of ensuring appropriate measures to be taken for European reconstruction. At the same time, US diplomats are maintaining a cautious and reserved attitude to avoid any criticism that could affect the consultations of the three foreign ministers. US political figures believe that the following conditions are necessary for the implementation of the US aid to Europe plan, given the current relations between European countries: (1) Abolish preferential tariff barriers; (2) Make various commercial agreements multilateral in nature; (3) Treat all countries on an equal basis; (4) The right to free navigation on European inland waterways, especially the Danube River; (5) Realize the economic unification of Germany; (6) Ratify and sign peace treaties; (7) Equitably distribute the resources of the European continent.</p>

<h3>Tenth Session of the Chamber of Commerce Member Representatives Congress; Appeals for Vigilance Against Economic Crisis; Heavy Taxation; Plans to Request the Government to Reform and Implement a Unified Tax System; The Issue of Amending the Chamber of Commerce Law Sparks Heated Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce held its tenth session of the Member Representatives Congress at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday. A total of 376 representatives from various industries attended, as well as more than ten officials, including Secretary-General Shen, representing Mayor Wu, Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Du Yuesheng of the Local Association, Representative Wang Xianqing of the City Party Headquarters, and Representative Chen Quan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All members spoke enthusiastically and passed 72 motions and 6 emergency provisional motions. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered the opening speech, followed by Standing Director Luo Qinghua's report on the work situation over the past year, which was divided into three points: (1) In terms of economic policy, the City Chamber of Commerce, in order to implement the resolutions of the previous congress, organized an industrial and commercial petition group to urge the government to provide production loans. It suggested abolishing the current foreign exchange controls and replacing them with an import-export linked sales system. Although it has not yet been realized, it has attracted the attention of the central government. The policy of suppressing commodity prices has also changed from price limits to negotiated prices due to the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce. (2) Labor-capital issues: After the victory, a widespread wave of labor unrest occurred, resulting in the adoption of salary payments based on the cost of living index. Now, due to the unfreezing and refreezing of the index, disputes have arisen again. The City Chamber of Commerce currently advocates two points: one is to restore the salary levels at the end of the 25th year of the Republic, but taking into account the facts; the other is that when factories encounter difficulties and are truly unable to maintain operations, labor and capital should negotiate and agree on discounts, from 90% to 60%. (3) Tax issues: Simplification of the collection procedures for profit tax in the 36th year of the Republic has been achieved after several rounds of negotiations. The central government has now agreed to change to standard simplification, sampling 5% to 10% of accounts for inspection, and abolish interest tax. It was also reported that the City Chamber of Commerce has won one or two seats in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Leaders deliver speeches one after another</p>
<p>Following the speeches by the officials, Secretary-General Shen said: After the First European War, France also experienced extreme difficulties in industry and commerce, similar to the situation in our country today. Ultimately, it relied on national unity to restore prosperity. He hoped that our industrial and commercial circles would work hard, unite as one, and that China would not find it difficult to restore prosperity. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said: The City Chamber of Commerce has made much more progress this year than last year. Currently, with industry and commerce facing a crisis, he hoped that the City Chamber of Commerce would have concrete and practical measures to save this crisis. The municipal government is happy to help promote its realization and hopes to overcome the difficulties through labor-capital cooperation. Representative Wang Xianqing of the City Party Headquarters blamed the current industrial and commercial crisis on internal strife. In the previous National Revolution, the overthrow of the warlords, and the war of resistance against Japan, industry and commerce indirectly and directly made their best efforts. Currently, with the country facing difficulties, he still hoped that the industrial and commercial circles would work together. Representative Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also expressed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs attaches importance to the industrial and commercial circles of this city and is willing to help the industrial and commercial circles solve their difficulties.</p>
<p>Discussing Provisional Motions</p>
<p>After the speeches by the officials, the discussion of provisional motions began: (1) Luo Qinghua, Wang Xianqing, Pan Shihao, Jin Runxiang, and others proposed that, with the economic crisis facing the eve of collapse, they plan to submit a request to the central government to quickly make emergency preparations to stabilize society and maintain the foundation of the country. After amendments were passed, it was forwarded to the central government. (2) Zhang Zhongyuan and others proposed uniting the national industrial and commercial circles to urge the government to end the civil war as soon as possible and strive for a $500 million loan from the US Export-Import Bank through diplomatic efforts, allocating $100 million to relieve industry and commerce. After a fierce debate, it was approved in principle and handed over to the Chamber of Commerce Council to organize the text and forward it to the central government. (3) Luo Qinghua proposed that, in order to stabilize social order, maintain industrial survival, and the livelihood of workers, the association should organize a labor problem research association to jointly seek labor-capital coordination. The original proposal was passed and handed over to the City Chamber of Commerce Council for prompt handling.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Returns to Shanghai, Talks Briefly; Visited Chairman to Report on the Current Situation of Commodity Prices in Shanghai; Adjustment of Public Utility Prices is Still Pending</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After Mayor Wu went to Beijing the night before, he returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties last night at 11:00 PM. According to Wu's statement to reporters: The purpose of going to Beijing was purely for the commodity price issue. After arriving in Beijing, he immediately visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reported on the current situation of commodity prices in the city, and asked for instructions on the key points of the economic supervision work. It was then decided that the Economic Supervision Council meeting would be established on July 1. The focus of its work will be on cracking down on the black market for gold banknotes and preventing hoarding and profiteering. According to Wu, the municipal government has the greatest determination to suppress commodity prices and, in principle, has decided to start with daily necessities. In particular, coal prices will be strictly controlled because they will affect the cost of public utilities.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also met with Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan, reported on the city's financial difficulties, and requested the central government to provide appropriate subsidies. It is said that it may be approved in principle, but it is still necessary to wait for Premier Zhang to carefully review the city's revenue and expenditure budget before making a decision.</p>
<p>When asked about the central government's instructions on the issue of adjusting public utility prices in the city, Wu replied: A final decision must await the National Commodity Price Conference. He did not bring any plans with him on this trip to Beijing. Wu denied last night the claim that public utility prices would rise from July 1, saying: "It's already too late in reality." According to general estimates, the price adjustment will be in mid-July.</p>
<h3>Additional Budgets for Various Bureaus and Offices; Seven Hundred Million Approved by the Mayor</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to the impact of rising commodity prices, various bureaus and offices of the municipal government have successively submitted requests for additional budgets. According to Min Xiangfan, director of the Municipal Government Accounting Office, to reporters yesterday: As of yesterday, the office has received 23 additional budget requests from various bureaus, totaling more than 7 billion yuan. In addition to the 4.1 billion yuan that has been approved by the mayor and allocated to various bureaus for use, more than ten additional budget requests have been received this week. Those that have been approved by the mayor include: (1) Printing costs for financial bureau bills and certificates (two items in total), totaling more than 300 million yuan; (2) Expenses for the Social Affairs Bureau's Commodity Price Appraisal Council, more than 60 million yuan; (3) Repair costs for the Yangjing Bridge of the Public Works Bureau, more than 200 million yuan; (4) Service fees for the Fire Department of the Police Bureau, more than 300 million yuan.

The total is more than 2.1 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Hundred and Three Trade Associations Propose Amending the Chamber of Commerce Law</h3>
<p>(4) The Bank Commercial Association and other two hundred and three trade associations jointly proposed amending Article 13 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and Article 16 of the Chamber of Commerce Regulations, abolishing the calculation of voting and election rights based on the amount of fees paid, conforming to reality and democratic principles. This case is of great importance to the City Chamber of Commerce itself and sparked intense debate throughout the meeting. Finally, Chairman Luo Qinghua compromised, agreeing in principle, but not unconditionally. It is necessary to engage legal experts to study and revise the details and consider the matter further. (5) The aforementioned association proposed that the current tax system has numerous items and overlapping collections, and they planned to request the government to reform and implement a unified tax system to improve the situation and benefit industry and commerce. The original proposal was passed and handed over to the council to organize a special committee to handle it. The discussion of the temporary motions ended at 5:45 PM. More than 50% of the members stood up one after another and were about to leave the meeting. Luo Qinghua and Xu Jiqing shouted loudly, asking the members to stay for another two hours, as more than 70 proposals were still to be discussed. They also sent Boy Scouts maintaining order at the venue to persuade members leaving the meeting to re-enter and continue the meeting. There were a total of 72 proposals. Reading them aloud was time-consuming. When the discussion reached the 31st item, it was already 6:30 PM. All the members present had not drunk, eaten, or rested for more than two hours and could not continue the meeting. Therefore, someone proposed that all future proposals be handled by the council according to the review opinions. The meeting then came to an end. Among the 72 proposals, important ones included the passage of the proposal to raise 1 billion yuan for the City Chamber of Commerce's education and library undertakings, and the amended passage of the proposal to revitalize real estate finance and alleviate the housing shortage.</p>
<h3>Winter Business Tax Filing Deadline Tomorrow</h3>

All those who have not yet filed their winter business tax for the previous year should promptly fill out the issued winter report form truthfully and submit it to the tax collection office in their jurisdiction for verification and collection. If they have not received the winter report form, they should obtain it from the tax collection office in their jurisdiction and should not delay filing on the grounds that they have not received it. If they fail to report within the deadline, the matter will be transferred to the court in accordance with the penalty provisions of the Business Tax Law for failing to file business operations within the prescribed time limit.

<h3>General Manager of Jianghai Bank Donates Family Assets to the Nation; Yu Luxin Lists Personal Property; Asks Local Public Opinion Organizations to Handle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Jianghai Bank of this city was formerly implicated in guaranteeing the Lu Chuang Construction Factory, which was contracted to build an airport for the Air Force Supply Command, and suffered a temporary financial strain, leading to the suspension of business and declaration of liquidation. It is now learned that Yu Luxin, the general manager of the bank, plans to list all his personal property immediately and ask the local public opinion organizations to handle it. In addition to paying off all debts, continuing to complete the Air Force's large airport project, and appropriating the necessary living expenses for himself and his family, all the remaining property will be donated to the nation. It is reported that Yu has been doing business in the city for many years and has founded many enterprises, such as the Luxin Cigarette Factory. According to informal estimates, after liquidation, there will still be a surplus of approximately 2 billion yuan in national currency. Yu came from the military. After the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast in the 20th year of the Republic, he organized a volunteer army to engage in resistance work. Later, he and other anti-Japanese generals such as Ma Zhanshan retreated to the Soviet Union and returned to the country via Europe, doing business in Shanghai. During the occupation of the city, Yu engaged in underground work for the Kuomintang and had a strong sense of national nationalism. This time, with the closure of Jianghai Bank, Yu witnessed the country's many difficulties after the victory and had no intention of continuing to do business. Therefore, he is willing to donate his family's assets to fulfill his national duty.</p>
<h3>Wang Wanshun Shot and Killed by Police; Two Groups Organize Support Association</h3>
<p>On the 26th of this month, there was a notice from Bu Zhenxiong stating: "On the evening of the 23rd, a police officer from the Xujiahui Police Station knocked on the door and entered, accusing him of being the person who caused trouble at the Hongqiao Grand Theater, grabbed him and slapped him. His father, Wanshun, came to the rescue upon seeing this and reasoned with the officer, but the officer fired a handgun, and the bullet entered Wanshun's abdomen, endangering his life." It is now learned that Wang Wanshun is a director of the Handcraft Cotton Weaving Industry Association. Due to the seriousness of the injury, he died on the evening of the 27th. His son, Zhenxiong, has decided to file a complaint with the District Procuratorate today for a post-mortem examination and request the Assistance Group of the People's Freedom Protection Association in this city to forward the request to the court and the police bureau, demanding that the murderer be severely punished and compensated for all losses.

<h3>Jianghai Customs Port Director Yuan Jin Accused of Corruption; District Attorney's Office to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yuan Jin, the port director of the Jianghai Customs General Tax Office, has been accused of corruption by the families of the victims of the "Liuxing" and "Haiguang" ships. The lawsuit lists four points: (1) During the enemy and puppet regime period, Yuan Jin remained in the Jianghai Customs service and offered the "Liuxing" and "Haiguang" ships to the Japanese, using them to transport grain for the enemy at sea. They were bombed and sunk by Allied aircraft, and all crew members of the two ships were killed. (2) On April 4th of this year, when the Haiyun ship was transporting new banknotes from the Central Bank from the United States and was docked in the port, 24,045,000 yuan was stolen. Yuan Jin was involved in this matter. (3) Yuan Jin extracted 25% of the wages of the workers of the Water Patrol Company as a handling fee. (4) The corruption case of Wei Fangjunde, the acting port police officer of Jianghai Customs, is also related to Yuan. After accepting the lawsuit, the District Attorney's Office sent a letter to the General Tax Office of Jianghai Customs for investigation. Yesterday, the Customs replied with content that was beneficial to Yuan Jin, stating that Yuan's stay in Shanghai was ordered by the General Tax Commissioner Meilehe and the Deputy General Tax Commissioner Ding Guitang. The two ships were requisitioned by the Japanese and had nothing to do with Yuan. The theft of the new banknotes was committed by six port patrolmen. Four criminals were arrested, and two are still at large. The Water Patrol Company is not affiliated with the Port Police Department and is only supervised by the department. The scheme has nothing to do with Yuan Jin. From September of last year to February of this year, threatening letters were frequently received from the families of the victims of the two ships. After receiving the reply, the District Attorney's Office will begin investigating within a few days.</p>

<h3>Credit Cooperatives Operating Deposits and Loans are No Different from "Underground Banks"; City Government Receives Telegram from Ministry of Finance to Strictly Ban</h3>

<h3>Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers Illegally Organize Mutual Aid Society; Jiang Guangqing Leads Meetings; Disruption of Order Investigated</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of Jiang Guangqing disrupting order was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation by the Hongkou Branch. There are two types of tricycles in the city: white-licensed and black-licensed. Black licenses are for private use and are not allowed to operate for profit. However, some black-licensed car owners allow others to use them after they no longer need them, so there are often black-licensed tricycle drivers soliciting business on the road, operating illegally. After the police bureau revoked their licenses, the unemployed drivers illegally organized the "Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers Unemployed Mutual Aid Society," led by Jiang Guangqing, and held three secret meetings near Kunshan Garden, planning to publish declarations and slogans, and petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Bureau, and the City Council. The day before yesterday, they gathered more than a hundred black-licensed tricycle drivers to hold a meeting next to Kunshan Garden, where Jiang delivered a speech. The Hongkou Police Branch dispatched police to disperse the drivers and took Jiang to the bureau for questioning. The police confiscated from Jiang's body a "Letter to Fellow Members of the Shanghai Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers Unemployed Mutual Aid Society" and a "List of Shanghai Black-Licensed Tricycle Drivers." It was found that although Jiang once worked as a tricycle driver, he changed his career in 1945 and is now a salesman at the Guangyi Printing House at 171 Lafayette Road, and has nothing to do with the drivers. Why did he volunteer to participate in the leadership, with no suspicion of inciting unrest and disrupting social order. Therefore, in accordance with Article 153, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of disrupting order, he was escorted to the District Attorney's Office yesterday for legal action.</p>

<h3>Tax Bureau Employee's Illegal Behavior: Tax Inspector Extorts 2 Million; Caught Accepting Money in Dance Hall</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Gao ZhiKuan, an employee of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau's Third Section, Stamp Tax Inspectorate, has been arrested by the Direct Tax Bureau and sent to the District Attorney's Office for legal action for extorting 2 million yuan from the owner of Xie Xing Hao, Li Wangshu. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, Gao, together with Ma Shirong, chief of the stamp tax unit of the Madang District Office of the bureau, and Zhou Ang and Zhang Jun, employees of the office, went to Xie Guang Hao at 110 Lane, 6 Dagu Road.

<h3>A Visit to the Xujin Tutoring School</h3>
<p>— Zhi Sheng</p>
<p>Although there are many schools in Shanghai, very few of them are well-managed. This is especially rare in the case of tutoring schools, which can hardly satisfy everyone's expectations. The author went to the Shanghai Private Xujin Tutoring School at the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Chengdu Road the other day, and the person in charge of the school gave a detailed account of the school's teaching policy. The author seemed to have discovered a new realm. In addition to admiring the school's principal for the rare spirit of education for education's sake, the author believes that the school's thoughtfulness and enthusiasm in assisting young people who are taking entrance exams are worth introducing.</p>
<p>The school was established nearly a year ago and specializes in guiding young students to review middle and high school courses and take entrance exams to major middle schools. It has a pre-university class, a high school advanced class, and a junior high school preparatory class. Now, it is expanding its enrollment and already has 800 students. Recently, at the board of directors meeting, Chairman Shen Gongzhan and directors Chen Baotai and Jiang Jianbai resolved to hire Xiao Yushu and others as directors, and solicit funds to expand the school. The school has added four college entrance examination guidance classes during the summer vacation this year and plans to enroll students in correspondence classes in other places, which has been approved by the Education Bureau. Most of the teachers are graduates of Jiaotong University with rich teaching experience. Their teaching is serious and they have won particular praise in science and engineering subjects. All subjects from the first year of junior high school to the third year of high school are available, and students can choose to study any subject. Moreover, in accordance with the regulations of the Education Bureau, no tuition fees are charged, only a small amount of miscellaneous fees, which can be said to be rare in private tutoring schools in Shanghai, and not easy to find.</p>
<p>Graduates of various schools often regard college entrance examinations as the first headache after the end of the semester. From choosing a school to registering for the entrance examination and registering for admission, they do not know how much running around it takes, and they still cannot be sure of getting their wish. For this reason, the school opened a college entrance examination guidance class during the summer vacation, with five weeks of classes, on the one hand to end their studies, and on the other hand to connect with the college entrance examination. The content of the curriculum is mostly the essentials of each subject, and the examination questions of each school are classified and compiled. If you can fully understand it, then getting into college is by no means difficult. At the same time, in order to enable students from various schools to receive guidance widely, the miscellaneous fees are only more than 20,000 yuan per subject, and the number of students has also increased to 600.</p>
<p>Now, it is probably only Xujin that can truly achieve the two words "guidance" in the various college entrance examination guidance classes. Because in addition to regular review and teaching, there is also the implementation of a college entrance examination guidance plan. That plan of thousands of words can indeed be called perfect, and it is still soliciting suggestions and improvements from students. According to this plan, there are several implementation guidelines that are very worthy of our praise:</p>
<p>(1) Collect past exam questions from various schools, and use the teaching materials of general schools as a reference, classify and compile them into a perfect handout, which is only supplied to students of this school, and teachers of each class will explain in detail the way each school asks questions, the traditional habits, and the attitude to take the exam.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the urgency of time, students are not allowed to ask any questions outside of that section during class, and another tutor is hired to stay in a specially designated office every day to answer any questions from students, whether they are within the teaching materials or outside the teaching materials. Or you can put the questions in the "Question and Answer" box, and the tutors will answer them separately.</p>
<p>(3) Specially hire tutors to explain everything about registration, examination, registration and admission of each school in the office, and the enrollment situation and dates of each school are announced in detail every day, so as to avoid students running around and distracting from their studies.</p>
<p>(4) The college entrance examination guidance committee will handle the registration, examination and registration procedures collectively on behalf of the students, and the school will contact the candidate service group of each school during the examination and lead them to the examination, so as to avoid temporary panic and delay the examination.</p>
<p>(5) If it is the time for the entrance examination of each school, a temporary liaison station will be set up in each school to facilitate the students of that school to rest or ask questions. From this guideline, it can be said that the school is meticulous in helping young students enter college, and this alone is enough to show the spirit of faithful and great service.</p>
<h3>Upset in Queen's Club: Brown Defeated, American Beattie Wins Over Australian Champion in Five Sets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Queen's Club, 27th] Due to the unprecedented heavy rain in Queen's Club today, the world-famous tennis court was turned into a swimming pool.

In the men's singles, three seeded players, Tom Brown, Geoff Brown, and Betoutra, have reached the last eight. (1) American Tom Brown fought hard for fifty-five games before eliminating Australian Long, 3-6, 13-11, 3-6, 6-1, 6-0. This bespectacled Australian player had not lost a set in the past four weeks and seemed to be able to pull off an upset. The key to yesterday's defeat was in the marathon 20th game, where Long broke Brown's serve to take a 10-9 lead, but immediately lost his own serve and eventually lost the set. In the last two sets, Long was exhausted. (2) Australian Geoff Brown defeated French Berry-Chau, 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Brown will play the winner of Kramo-Johnson in the semi-final, and Tom Brown will meet last year's champion Betoutra. (3) French Betoutra defeated New Zealander Robertson, 6-2, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Finals: Lianxing Masterpiece Greatly Defeats Youjia</h3>
<p>Result 6 to 1</p>
<p>The second match of the second table tennis finals was held between Youjia, the champion of the fourth division, and Lianxing, the runner-up of the first division, at the Central Auditorium at 8 pm the night before. Despite the heavy rain, more than 800 spectators still attended, creating a enthusiastic atmosphere. In the first match, Youjia's Li Guangyao played against Lianxing's Feng Hao. Li had a great reputation, but he could not defend for long, and Feng won by three to one. In the next group, Youjia's chopper Zhou Xintang fought against Lianxing's all-rounder Chen Xingli. The situation was tense. Although Zhou took the lead several times, Chen tied the score. In the final game, Zhou led by ten to nine, but unfortunately lost three points in a row, turning victory into defeat, which was very regrettable. Lianxing's winning streak greatly increased their courage. In the third group, Zhang Shanda played another miracle effect. In the fourth group, Youjia's veteran Wang Huijun faced Lianxing's Wu Zuochang. The veteran Wang showed extraordinary skills, and Zuochang carefully dealt with the battle for five games, with many wonderful moments. Lianxing was lucky and reversed the defeat with three to two, laying the foundation for victory. In the fifth group, Lianxing's new player Jiang Baiquan suddenly showed his talent, but he was unfortunately defeated by Youjia's Liu Zaoshi. Jiang was defeated by Liu. In the sixth and seventh groups, Youjia's Yu and Zhuang had no intention of fighting because the overall situation was already set. As a result, Lianxing defeated Youjia with six to one, shocking everyone. It can be said that the new generation replaces the old generation.</p>
<p>Tonight from 8 pm, the third match of the finals will still be held at the same place, with Hualian, the champion of the third division, facing Youyi, the runner-up. The former won the victory in the third division finals. They will meet again tonight on a narrow road, and they are particularly jealous.

<p>[Our Newspaper] The third committee meeting of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee was held at the committee's office from 10 am yesterday. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs made a special trip from the capital to participate. More than ten members of the committee attended, chaired by Chairman Zou Bingwen. The committee members, based on the standpoint of the national private yarn mills, jointly discussed measures to stabilize the prices of yarn and cloth, and adjourned at about 1 pm.</p>
<p>The committee members of the private mills, yesterday afternoon, at the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, summoned the heads of the association, and jointly discussed the opinions of the private mills on stabilizing yarn and cloth prices.</p>
<p>From 8 pm last night, the third committee meeting of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee continued to be held at the 12th floor of the Wing On Company's new building. As of the time of publication, the meeting was still in progress.</p>
<p>Also, at the meeting of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee yesterday morning, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in his speech, said: The purpose of establishing the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee is to have the government and merchants cooperate closely.

<h3>Yongsha Rise Hindered, Small Stocks Active</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market yesterday was very erratic. Yongsha's decline was due to the long holiday period, the interest payable still needing 3.9 to 4.55 jiao, and the upcoming swap date after the holiday. Bulls could not bear the burden, and major players also wavered, resulting in a low close. The general public had a 50% cash margin requirement, but the exchange has not yet issued a notice, and it is rumored that the broker representatives still need to go to Beijing, so there is still optimistic hope. It rose and fell repeatedly in the middle, with very rapid fluctuations. Small and second-tier hot stocks such as Meiya and Xinguang were very popular, rising instead of falling. Miscellaneous stocks such as Cement and Rongfeng even rose to the limit, mainly because some people took advantage of the rise in Xinguang and Meiya, and Cement and Rongfeng will also increase capital.</p>
<p>In the early morning, news that the US would lend us military supplies improved sentiment. Except for Yongsha's sluggishness, all other stocks opened high, especially Xinguang. After Yongsha opened, numbers 148, 142, and 112 rose to 9450 yuan, while numbers 155, 160, 36, 157, 142, and 163 were sold at 9230 yuan. Numbers 148, 35, 223, 69, 152, and 213 then came in, and number 142 suddenly came in after exiting number 32, rising to 9500 yuan. Numbers 235 and 171 were still selling and struggling, while numbers 224, 186, 143, 103, and 218 came in, and numbers 159 and 32 came in, even buying current Yongsha, and it rebounded to 9600 yuan. Numbers 235, 185, 157, 155, 174, 36, 8, 224, 76, and 32 were all sold, and after 10 o'clock it fell to 9270 yuan. Numbers 125, 232, 76, and 155 all came in, and number 104 even bought current Yongsha, and sentiment easily rebounded. Meiya's current transactions were first hung at the limit by number 223 and Shouguang. Then Meiya was bought in by numbers 202, 157, 197, 232, etc., also pushing it to the limit. Xinguang was forcefully bought in by numbers 204 and 154, soaring upwards. Jingfu was also absorbed by number 204, following suit. Then Yongsha rose again to over 9500 yuan. Numbers 65, 8, 36, 224, and 140 took the opportunity to sell, and it fell back to 9300 yuan. Numbers 190, 78, and 12 were still coming in, and numbers 18 and 104 came to buy current Yongsha, rising to 9450 yuan. Number 235 constantly sold current and deferred Yongsha, hindering the rise. Number 185 also sold current Yongsha, and numbers 130, 12, 83, 224, and small bulls reduced selling, and it fell to 9200 yuan. At 11:40, numbers 231, 112, and 14 made one last attempt to raise deferred Yongsha to over 9400 yuan. Numbers 157, 235, 224, 104, 213, 100, and 148 cut long positions, and numbers 185 and 217 also sold current Yongsha. Although Cement was at the limit due to number 220, and Rongfeng was at the limit due to number 83, with long positions wavering, deferred Yongsha gradually fell to 9060 yuan at noon. Current transactions were also at the low price of 8750 yuan. Numbers 112, 160, 202, 235, 224, 186, and 213 came in, and it was still easy to pull it up before closing. Current Meiya again approached the price limit. It ended at 9170 yuan at noon. After closing, numbers 213 and 152, etc., all came in, and it was again called up to around 9300 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, current transactions of Yongsha and Huafeng each rose slightly, Xinye and Yonggong were flat, and XInhe, Qinxing, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Zhongfa each rose by a little over half a jiao to a little less than one jiao. Meiya rose to the limit, Rongfeng rebounded after hitting the limit, gaining a little over half a jiao, Cement hit the limit, Zhongfang, Lian, and Xinhua were flat, Datong, Huochai, and Jinglun Innerwear each declined slightly, and ZhongsI and Tongyi each rose by about half a jiao. Other stocks rose slightly.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Regains Momentum</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were wavering due to the uncertain tightness of credit in the market. By about 10:30 AM, it was heard that the Textile Construction company had reduced the quota for fellow trading houses, so the supply was not quiet. Customers saw the low prices and forcefully absorbed them, so the final market price rose again. The price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was expensive at 440,000 yuan, 11,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Fine cloths such as Wufu Caiqiu and Yanghe also rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan.

Mung beans continued to be handled in Nanyang, rising by 5,000 to 6,000 to 10,000 yuan. Under the fierce absorption of red beans in Guangdong, they reached their peak, soaring by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, reaching the 300,000 mark.

[Our Newspaper] Fulai Company's Far East route's China Yimeili arrived in Shanghai from Yangon yesterday, bringing 3,439 tons of rice (about 35,000 bags), and is now unloading at buoys 16 and 17.</p>
<p>Small Wheat Loan Approved for 300 Billion Yuan</p>
<p>Since the new wheat from various producing areas entered the market in early June, various flour mills have lacked funds and have not yet purchased it, so all parties are paying attention to how the financial authorities will coordinate this year's wheat loan to solve the current grain shortage. It is now known that the Four Joint Offices attaches great importance to this year's flour and wheat loan and is handling it as a special case. It has been investigated by a special team, and the amount has been determined. The approved total amount is 300 billion yuan, which will be undertaken by 58 flour mills along the Beijing-Shanghai line, and will be submitted to the board of directors of the Four Joint Offices next Thursday (July 3) for approval.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the yarn market situation, the market was still weak at the beginning of the morning, because the June closing date was approaching, and many floating long positions were being closed.

The closing price of Double Horse was 10.2 million yuan, which was 250,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 18.2 million, a gain of 400,000 yuan. Except for the slight drop in 40-count and 32-count yarns, the prices of 20-count and 16-count yarns all rose.</p>

The committee sent a notice to each designated bank via Central Bank Business Bureau document No. 103, stating: The revised method for reviewing non-import foreign exchange applications has been approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. Please find attached the entire method and follow it. (The entire method has been detailed in the sixth edition of this newspaper on the 26th.)</p>
<p>In addition, there is an attached full text of the Executive Yuan's telegram No. 23545 to the Central Bank on June 18 of this year, stating: The previously submitted revised method for reviewing non-import foreign exchange applications has been approved.

<h3>Silk Association Decides on Opening Date for Silk Mills Tight Credit Leads to Silk Market Decline</h3>
<p>The Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Economy held its ninth meeting yesterday afternoon, presided over by Chairman Tan Xihong. The key issues resolved are as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Determine the opening date of silk mills, from July 1 to July 15. (2) A grain and worker loan of 84 billion yuan is requested to be approved by the Four Joint Offices as soon as possible to facilitate the start of work. (3) The remaining cocoon-for-silk issue will be handled by the China Silk Corporation first offering a portion of approximately 4,500 dan to silk mills for silk reeling. The method will be formulated by the China Silk Corporation and then submitted to the meeting for approval. The cooperation society's dried cocoon reeling will still be handled according to the method decided at the previous meeting. (4) The association will send a telegram to the Ministries of Agriculture and Economy to forward the fuel for each factory to the competent authority for allocation according to the quota. (5) The issue of silk sales will be submitted to the Design Committee of the association to develop concrete plans and then submit them to the meeting for discussion.

<p>[Another Dispatch] According to news from the silk weaving industry, the association will allocate a portion of the original quota to new members in order to balance the distribution of rayon. The amount allocated to the industry by the China Trust Bureau in June is 10% of the original quota, approximately 100 boxes, which will be distributed next Monday.</p>
<p>Raw silk prices have been rising continuously without a return. The market only slightly recovered at the close of the previous day. When the market opened yesterday morning, the sixth ending period credit was still very tight in the same industry. The price of Grade A 20/22 denier per dan was 34 million yuan, Grade B was 33.5 million yuan, Grade C was 32.5 million yuan, Grade D was 32 million yuan, Grade E was 21.5 million yuan, with 15 lots transacted. The China Silk Corporation released 10 dan of opening stock for one week at a price of 32 million yuan per dan. Shengxian Cooperative released 10 dan of July Grade D futures at a price of 32.5 million yuan per dan. Jili Qianjing still stood at 24 million yuan per dan, with five transactions made. There were no transactions for Sichuan gray silk, and export sales were quiet.</p>
<h3>50,000 Tons of Salt to be Transported to Changsha and Other Ports</h3>
<p>According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: There is a large amount of salt stored in Lianyungang, with 50,000 tons urgently awaiting shipment. The head office has now sent a ship to load the salt, which will be transported to various provinces and counties along the Yangtze River for sale. In addition, the company's Hai Xuan ship arrived in Yangon yesterday and will load Burmese rice to return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Declining</h3>
<p>The cigarette market situation yesterday initially showed stability, but around 9:00 AM, various parties' funds became tighter again. Foreign firms and foreign-funded firms in the market actively resold cigarettes from other ports, and those with long positions sold off due to the increasingly tight June settlement period. In particular, Hado Men cigarettes had more than enough inventory, so the final ten cases of Great Britain cigarettes fell to 7.44 million yuan, a decrease of 180,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Lao Dao brand also fell by 210,000 yuan, and Wuhua and Hado Men both fell by 120,000 yuan. The remaining Chinese merchant cigarettes also fell by 400 to 500 yuan to 1,350 yuan per carton. American goods such as Six Camel cigarettes are in short supply and inventory is insufficient, and sales are quite smooth, so the market price has risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per carton.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Sharply with Small Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a small rebound after a sharp rise because it was Saturday and next Monday was the June ending period, and some holders were inevitably inclined to resell due to the tight credit situation. The association's reference price for Peruvian sand was 120,000 yuan, ranging from 660,000 to 672,000 yuan. Taiwan No. 20 sand was 585,000 to 590,000 yuan, down 20,000 yuan. The decline of Sanbanche white was greater, at 620,000 yuan. Shantou green was 426,000 yuan, down 4,000 yuan. Hainan red was still 500,000 yuan, Hainan red was 450,000 yuan, and Xinghua white did not change much, opening at 580,000 yuan and the next one at 535,000 yuan. Xing red was slightly looser, at 434,000 yuan, Dia Qing was 382,000 yuan, down 8,000 yuan. A total of 300 to 400 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Serge in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Regarding the serge market, the remaining items are all in short and lively demand, except for snow white and low-grade artificial cotton. The medium thick and thin plain green colors are all out of circulation. Because the total inventory in Shanghai is limited, the factory's production is much less than other woolens. Due to environmental conditions, American and Hong Kong shipments have disappeared. The profit of serge trading is much more solid than that of flannels, so there are few producers and sellers in factories and trading houses. Yesterday, the thin plain serge was particularly in short supply due to the lack of American imports, resulting in its selling price being comparable to that of the medium thick serge.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Results are Good</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The amount of US dollar bills sold has been increasing recently. Yesterday, short-term treasury bills were sold for a total of US$790,520. Of this, the China Trust Bureau sold US$592,670, Xinhua Bank US$85,000, Bank of China US$39,350, China National Goods Bank US$20,000, and Jincheng Bank US$12,450.</p>

<h3>The Cultural County: A Full View of Yuyao</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou 25th Dispatch, Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian</p>
<p>Yuyao is not only a famous county in eastern Zhejiang, but also an important place historically and industrially nationwide. Spiritually, it nurtured luminaries such as Wang Yangming, Huang Lizhou, Zhu Shunshui, and Yan Ziling, providing the country and abroad with noble character and renowned scholarship. Materially, it supplied essential commodities such as salt, cotton, and tea. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, Yuyao was occupied for four and a half years. The enemy seized the county seat, established a puppet regime under Lao Naixin, while the Third and Fifth Detachments of the "New Fourth Army," based in Liangnong, entrenched themselves in Siming Mountain and its vicinity, dividing Yuyao into two counties: Yuyao County in the north and Nanshan County in the south (the former governed by [blank space], the latter by Zhang Zhiguang). The legitimate county government, led by Ni Yongqiang, remained underground, engaging in guerrilla warfare in the mountainous areas. Consequently, on a total of just over 2.2 million mu of land, there were four county magistrates. Although Yuyao was occupied for four and a half years, its losses were more severe than in other places. In the Siming Mountains, remnants of banditry still lurk, constantly seeking opportunities to disrupt the local area. To understand this troubled "Cultural County," the reporter made a special trip via the Xiaoshao Highway to visit it.</p>
<p>Severe Depletion of Vitality Requires Ten Years to Recover</p>
<p>According to the current County Magistrate Zhan Shiluo, "The bandits not only seized territory militarily and politically, establishing their own regimes, but also issued a large amount of 'Anti-Japanese Currency,' forcibly using it to collect legal tender at a ratio of one to forty, implementing economic plunder and exploitation. Even now, much of it remains among the people, who can only sigh at this useless waste paper." He paused, furrowing his brow, and said, "In recent years, Yuyao's vitality has been severely depleted, and it will take at least ten years to recover."</p>
<p>Current Status of Tea, Cotton, Rice, and Salt: The Focus is Not in the County Seat</p>
<p>Yuyao is bordered by Hangzhou Bay to the north and Siming Mountain to the south, resembling a folding fan in topography and a trapezoid in geology. The southern end is mountainous, producing tea; slightly north is a plain, a rice-growing area; further north is a cotton-growing area; and the coastal area is a salt-producing area. The total arable land in the county (including fields, land, mountains, and wetlands) amounts to 833,173 mu, but because not all of it can be planted with rice, the annual yield is only 1.49 million dan, insufficient for the county's needs. Fortunately, in the northern Yuyao area, local resources are used, with cotton and wheat intercropped, and 300,000 dan of wheat and more than 265,000 dan of miscellaneous grains can be harvested annually, providing some relief. Currently, the county's population is 690,000, with an average of only slightly less than 1.21 mu of arable land per person, so the food crisis is deeply rooted, and transportation from neighboring counties is needed every year. This year, Ningbo has transported a lot of rice, so Yuyao's rice price is still low, at 230,000 to 240,000 yuan per shi. Yuyao's customs, whether in the mountainous, salt-producing, cotton-growing, or rice-growing areas, are generally still simple and frugal. Even the county seat of Yuyao retains the essence of an agricultural town, quiet and peaceful, unlike the hustle and bustle of commercial cities. Mr. Ni Yongqiang, the current speaker of the County Council, further told me a unique feature: "If other places want to host banquets, whether it's buying vegetables or hiring chefs, they always go to the city, but in Yuyao, it's the opposite. You have to go to the countryside to find chefs and buy vegetables. So Yuyao's center of gravity is in the townships, not in the county seat."</p>
<p>Yuyao was originally not a commercial city, but today Yuyao's commerce is even more desolate. The busiest street in the city, "Xin Jian Road," is far from as prosperous as it was before the war. Moreover, according to Ma Zhongfu, the editor-in-chief of Yuyao's Zhejiang Eastern Daily, "Even the current market situation is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. When accounts were settled this spring, many shops had already closed, and more were struggling to survive by borrowing high-interest loans. The situation is quite pitiful. The decline of commerce has affected our newspaper industry. Now Yuyao has only two newspapers (the other is Nanlei Daily), both struggling to survive, so they have long since switched to publishing four-page newspapers."</p>
<p>The Bridge Connecting Yuyao's North and South (Report from Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian)</p>
<p>Simple and Hardworking Customs, Poor Conditions in Rural Areas</p>
<p>The situation in the countryside is not very good either. The simple and hardworking customs of Yuyao people, with men plowing and women weaving, are still maintained, but affected by foreign exchange, some have declined. The southern mountainous area of Yuyao originally produced tea, but the cost is high, and it is impossible to export it. This year, only one or two tea factories in the entire province are operating. The goods are abandoned on the ground, and all they can do is watch it close down in vain. Therefore, tea farmers are reluctant to pick tea. Women, who used to weave hats and sell them to Southeast Asia and the Philippines, a major home handicraft industry with as many as 50,000 female workers, who could produce more than 16,000 caps a day, earning about thirty yuan per month, a major source of household income. But now, Philippine grass hat silk cannot be imported in large quantities, and even if it is imported, the wages are low, so many housewives [illegible]. According to the County Magistrate, "There are currently 200,000 people engaged in weaving in the county, all using '77 hand-cranked looms,' producing 100,000 bolts of local cloth annually, which are transported to Ningbo and Shaoxing via inland rivers, providing a large supply of clothing for rural Zhejiang." As for the [illegible] fields in northern Yuyao, the lives of the salt workers there are even more difficult, and the labor is even more arduous. Women also work with men, doing the "scooping, leaching, stacking, and drying" work of salt production. Because the situation there is special, the reporter will write a separate article to report on it.</p>
<p>Yuyao County Magistrate Zhan, Council Speaker Ni, and others took a photo with the reporter in front of the county government building. (Report from Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian)</p>
<p>Accelerating the Construction of the Yao-Liang Highway, Eliminating Remnant Bandits in the Mountains</p>
<p>Since the restoration, Yuyao has steadily embarked on the road of construction. Although the security problem has been deeply affected by the lurking bandits in the mountains, since the establishment of the Siming Mountain Pacification Zone, the Pacification Headquarters has been stationed in Liangnong, and the Commissioner's Office has also moved to Yuyao to facilitate Commissioner Zheng's supervision of the remaining bandits. Therefore, today the remnants of the Siming Mountains are no longer able to exert military effectiveness. According to local people, "The area has already been stabilized, but there are some deserters who sometimes take advantage of the unpreparedness to do some bad things, robbing homes, but it is rare to hear about it. Now we only hope that the authorities will manage the discipline of the clearing troops more strictly, because the harassment of the people by these soldiers often makes us feel disgusted with the clearing. If the authorities do not pay attention to these details, it may change the perception of the general ignorant farmers, thinking that it is similar to guerrilla warfare during the occupation. This is very dangerous." This is the current [illegible] issue said by an intellectual from the countryside. The reporter also asked County Magistrate Qi about the security issue, when it can be completely suppressed. He said, "It's hard to say, our difficulty is to deal with the intangible with the tangible, to deal with the darkness with the light, to deal with the lawless with the law-abiding, so there is a significant difference in action. Sometimes twenty or thirty bandits suddenly attack a defenseless township office or police station outpost, confiscating weapons, which is a striking example of this difficulty. But in general, we have made it impossible for the remaining bandits to carry out military activities. We are now accelerating the construction of the Yao-Liang Highway. Once the transportation in the Siming Mountain area is convenient, they will [illegible] to settle in their old nests."</p>
<p>Therefore, our topic turned to the neighboring construction. The most noteworthy is highway construction. Yuyao's highway transportation had a considerable foundation before the war, but it was completely destroyed during the occupation. After the government returned in September of the 34th year, it took the restoration of transportation as the primary task of governance, painstakingly planned, and was funded by fellow villagers from Shanghai. Those built by private enterprises included the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway [illegible] (as the Ningbo-Shaoxing Highway), as well as the Yuyao-Zhouxing, Ditang- [illegible], Shengzhen-Yushan, and Guan-Cao Highway sections, totaling eighty kilometers, costing more than 500 million yuan. The Yu-Liang Highway, which is 22 kilometers long from Yuyao to Jienong, was initiated and built by the government itself. The roadbed and earthwork have now been completed. The planned routes also include the Zhang (Shu)-Xin (Pu) Road, which is ten kilometers long, and the Yu (Yao)-(Lujiapu) Road, which is six kilometers long. Now, cars can reach all townships in northern Yuyao, so it has become the most developed salt area in Zhejiang's highway transportation. As for the construction of village telephones, according to the plan, it is based on the original eight administrative districts as the center, with districts arranged separately. Those already connected account for one-third of the county's villages, and another third will soon be connected. This is of great help to rural security.</p>
<p>The Quiet Yao River (Report from Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian Shou)</p>
<h3>The County Government Promotes Two Unique Movements: Grain Assistance for Education and Document Inspection</h3>
<p>Recently, the Yuyao County Government has promoted two unique movements: "Grain Assistance for Education" and "Implementation of Document Inspection." China's so-called "document politics" must go through steps such as receiving documents, dividing them into sections, drafting, reviewing and approving, copying, sealing and issuing, and archiving, which is a long and slow process, greatly affecting administrative efficiency. The County Magistrate is a young politician, so he is unwilling to stick to the old ways like old civil servants and is willing to do something. Therefore, in addition to immersing himself in the county's restoration and construction work, he also paid attention to the efficiency of his own government affairs. In addition to the existing inspection methods for receiving, distributing, reviewing, copying, sending for printing, and archiving documents, he has recently drafted the most important part of the document processing procedures, namely the inspection methods for the review and drafting of official duties by personnel in each section, so as not to stop or delay. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The method is to compile a set of forms, with reward and punishment measures, to be inspected once every half month. According to statistics, the average number of unprocessed documents is only 9.58% each time, which is a great improvement compared to before the implementation. Therefore, County Magistrate Zhan hopes that this method can be improved at any time, so that it can become a widespread and systematic system in the future to help improve administrative efficiency. As for "Grain Assistance for Education," it is to remedy the difficulties of education funding and is similar to "donating funds to promote education." That is, a special committee is organized by relevant parties, stipulating that each mu of paddy field will assist with six jin, three jin for sandy fields, and two jin for construction land, with the tenant and landlord each bearing half, and stipulating that each jin will be converted into 180 yuan of national currency. In May, more than 16 million yuan had been collected. Since March, the national education funding for the entire county has relied entirely on this fund. Taking from the people and using it for the people, benefiting young children and saving the national education crisis, this is also a better way.</p>
<p>Promoting the Spirit of the Sages and Building a New Yuyao</p>
<p>For three hundred years, Yuyao has been known as a "Cultural County." Mr. Wang Yangming (1471-1528) was born in the Goruilou Hall of North City Shoushan in the eighth year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty. He became famous for his guidance in learning and created the theory of "unity of knowledge and action." When he was the post station magistrate of Longchang, he advocated education, cultivated customs, transformed the Miao and Li peoples, and quelled wars. His lofty aspirations and arduous practices have benefited hundreds of generations. Today, there is a Yangming Temple on Longquan Mountain in the north city. There is a stone statue, bluish-black, with a solemn appearance, but unfortunately, it was stolen by the enemy and has not yet been recovered. The Ming Shenyuan, where he praised the past and studied in his later years, is now dilapidated, and only the commemorative stone tablet in front of the county government is still available for people to admire. Recently, Mr. Song Hanning, the general manager of the Bank of China in Yao, donated 1 billion yuan and is building a new-style Yangming Hospital in the north of the city, equipped with X-rays, which can be written as the first-class hospital in eastern Zhejiang. Another person, Huang Lizhou (1610-1695), known for [illegible] studying the classics and history and being well-versed in literature, was born in Huangzhupu, Yuyao, in the 38th year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty. Not only was he unique in historiography, with works such as "Ming Confucianism Case" and "Mingyi Daifang Lu," but he was also a revolutionary, dedicated to the restoration movement throughout his life. His tomb is still in Hua'an Mountain, Huhuxiang, twenty miles away from the city. Zhu Shunshui (1600-1682) was born in Yuyao in the 28th year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty. He was a Confucian scholar who [illegible] and foreign countries. [Illegible] the fall of the Ming Dynasty, he [illegible] overseas. He stayed in Japan for nine years, single-handedly creating the cultural system of the book, mastering learning, being good at craftsmanship, advocating practice, and rejecting metaphysical discussions. He fled to Japan and copied it on Mount Ruifan in Japan. [illegible] There is no ancient town. After the enemy army attacked and occupied Yuyao County, they immediately sold and held a collective public sacrifice, which shows Zhu Gong's prestige in Japan. There is also Yan Ziling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, who was also from Yuyao, originally surnamed Zhuang. When Emperor Ming [illegible], he changed his name to Fa Guang, styled Ziling. He studied with Emperor Guangwu of Han when he was young and was known for his admiration of integrity. His tomb is between Zheng Mountain and Yuyao, with a "Gaofeng Pavilion." The township has also been renamed Gaofeng Township. The stone tablets of these four sages are all erected in front of the county government, and everyone admires their lofty aspirations, arduous practices, and renowned scholarship. More than 690,000 Yuyao citizens should take these sages as their role models to promote their spirit and build their hometown.</p>
<h3>China's Friend Kennedy, Kuang Bingyao Sits on the First Seat in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>During my last few days in Hollywood, I met Mr. Kennedy, one of the owners of Columbia Pictures. Kennedy's full name is Qian, Lichert, Kennedy. He is now Columbia's " [illegible] person". Wearing a black striped suit, highlighting a delicate round face, he is very kind. No matter what he says, he always has a [illegible] "smiling face" that Western society admires most. While talking to guests, he kept lighting cigarettes one after another. He looks like he is only in his forties, so in this [illegible] group in Hollywood, he belongs to the "young group."</p>
<p>Most of the younger generation is dissatisfied with the status quo. Kennedy translated the established practices in this film kingdom and often showed a deep hatred for them. For example, he said: Hollywood's Xu Dong film bosses, Lei Ying directors, and even big stars, they never believe that Chinese people can [illegible] movies, "In addition to the simple equipment and insufficient funds in China, [illegible] they are very suspicious of the acting skills of Chinese people." Kennedy has studied this issue with many people in the film industry. They either say that the expressions of Chinese people are not enough, or that the movements of Chinese people are clumsy.</p>
<p>Acting in Chinese Films, Will Hire Overseas Chinese to Star</p>
<p>But Kennedy, the young man, has always held a skeptical view. He is determined to make a Chinese film, not only with Chinese actors but also with Chinese actors as the main characters. He said that he deeply hates two things: first, many American actors pretend to be Chinese to act in Chinese dramas. Second, he hates many Tong films that treat Chinese people as "errand boys" and as many other kinds of clowns.</p>
<p>Kennedy and Mao Gentao have a deep personal relationship. When Mao Gentao was the Minister of Finance, Kennedy served as a special committee member in the Ministry of Finance, concurrently handling the " [illegible] " of the Minister and the Ministry of Finance's external publicity affairs. He is a writer, a cultural person, a dramatist, a civil servant, and also a wealthy capitalist. When handling the confidential matters of the Ministry of Finance, he learned of a Chinese opium case, in which Japanese ronin smuggled into China. At that time, he was a "working" civil servant and could not immediately write this story, so he waited for several years.</p>
<p>After Mao Gentao handed over the Ministry of Finance, Kennedy abandoned this "poor errand" and returned to the life of writing dramas. The story he wrote in the Ministry of Finance, after his "skillful writing" embellishment, was finally put on the screen by Columbia Public Corporation. This is the origin of "Stealing the National Treasury."</p>
<p>Kennedy said: "After that, I looked for Chinese actors as the main characters everywhere. This is a rather troublesome issue." He once thought of going to Shanghai to recruit, but he was worried about the language problem of Chinese film actors. He said: "American films must of course be spoken in English. English must not only be fluent and clear, but also sonorous and pleasant"! In this way, it has been delayed for a long time.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuang Bingxiong, an Overseas Chinese Star</p>
<p>By chance, he met Kuang Bingxiong, an overseas Chinese star in Hollywood, in a restaurant. [Illegible] From Saiwada after getting married, he came to Hollywood with his new wife, Chen Cuifang. Kennedy's wife first discovered that Chen Cuifang could act, and at that time they talked about many life experiences and resumes. Kennedy asked Chen:</p>
<p>"Would you like to act in a movie? We want to ask you to play the leading role in a blockbuster"?</p>
<p>"Oh my God, I have never acted in a movie. I don't know anything"! The young overseas Chinese bride cried out in surprise.</p>
<p>Some people say: This is Kennedy's "deliberate surprise." When Kennedy proposed this new decision at the company's business meeting, he encountered strict [illegible] criticism and opposition. However, Kennedy's Tao Pu, wanted to invest two million dollars; "If the production of "Stealing the National Treasury" fails, I am willing to bear all the losses"!</p>
<p>In this way, an overseas Chinese girl who had never had any screen experience suddenly entered Hollywood's "star" circle. American newspapers and magazines all published special columns, and Chinese newspapers in San Francisco reported this news in more detail.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Youth Narrates His Acting Experience</p>
<p>I met Mr. Kuang Bingxiong and his wife in Hollywood. Mr. Kuang's English name is "Bianqin Fang", which is a direct translation based on the Guangdong dialect. Li Jun is from Taishan. He studied in Sacramento, California as an overseas Chinese student. When he was a child, he returned to Guangdong to study for a period of time. Later, he also studied at Lingnan University. I saw the school flag of Lingnan University hanging in his living room.</p>
<p>Li is only twenty-eight years old now. Since Huang Liuhong retired, he is now considered the number one Chinese actor in Hollywood. When I talked to many overseas Chinese young men and women in the Midwest or West Coast, they all had a [illegible] hot worship for "Bianqin Fang".</p>
<p>According to Li Bingxiong himself: His small world was initially [illegible] picked up by "Paramount". Later, he acted in plays for several companies. In Hollywood, he has been involved in 34 films, 33 of which were filmed in Hollywood, and one was filmed in Mexico. He speaks very good English and also understands Spanish. However, he cannot speak Mandarin. In addition to the Taishan dialect, even "Putonghua" is very difficult to speak. I advised him: It is not too difficult for Chinese people to learn Mandarin. When acting in movies about China, if there are a few sentences that need to be inserted in Chinese, it is best to speak Mandarin?</p>
<p>The domestic [illegible] public also has an impression of "Bianqin Fang". In "The Black Dragon Society's Evil Matchmaker", he played the adopted son who killed his father, and in "Thirty Sands Above Tokyo" ("Kingcom"), he also had his clock heads. In "Charlie Chan's Detective Cases", he still played Chen [illegible]'s second son. The Spanish film he recently shot in Mexico is called: "Shanghai Nightclub."</p>
<p>There are about 300 Overseas Chinese Stars in the United States</p>
<p>There are about 300 Chinese actors who appear in Hollywood, including extras and group actors. In addition, there are also Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos, who often pretend to be Chinese to shoot films. The period from 1941 to 1945 during the war was the golden age for overseas Chinese actors. Many Chinese people often played roles such as Japanese warlords. One with the surname Luo was famous for playing Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>Zheng Bingxiong's new wife, Chen Cuifang, the protagonist of "Stealing the National Treasury", is only twenty years old now. She was born in Detroit, the industrial center of the United States. Her father is an overseas Chinese businessman from Guangdong who runs a "Huali Company" there. Chen Cuifang's acting "pen name" is "Maylia". The day I visited Columbia Pictures, I got to know "Beauty", and it was "known to everyone".</p>
<p>According to Kennedy, "Stealing the National Treasury" has been quite satisfactory. The male protagonist Dick Powell, the protagonist of "Magic Qin King", is not only a "red star" but also the pillar of Columbia. The female protagonist "Beautiful Chen", although a novice, but she is very hardworking, very humble, willing to learn, and plus her high talent, she performs no differently from veteran stars!</p>
<p>He also said: "It is unprecedented for a Chinese actor to earn 500 yuan a week in Hollywood. When I made the decision, many people scolded me and opposed me, but in order to protect my film - Stealing the National Treasury, I decided to do so!"</p>
<p>The location shooting team of "Stealing the National Treasury" has gone to Shanghai. At the end of this year, it can be completely edited and completed anyway. Kennedy wants to choose me to come to Hollywood again to watch the preview, and I am very grateful for his kindness. Dong agreed with his opinion. I told him a word: Let those guys who underestimate Chinese art go to China to take a look.</p>
<p>Kennedy nodded frequently. He said that he believed that the Chinese theater world must have extraordinary contributions and achievements. He said that he is always willing to visit China. If the Chinese art world welcomes him to China one day! (Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing Reported from New York)</p>

<h3>The Road of Chinese Art</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I saw a special issue of this magazine "Where is Chinese Art Going". Friends in the industry have put forward many valuable opinions as guidance for Chinese art workers in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, in more than a dozen short articles, everyone put forward the most profound and reasonable opinions from various different perspectives; some advocate establishing objective criticism and new theories, some advocate expressing themselves, some advocate popularizing art, ... and so on, indeed putting forward how to diagnose the crux of Chinese art. However, the reality is that objective factors have already proven that Chinese art is a "dead end".</p>
<p>The new theory and criticism of artistic soil are the foundation of artistic works. However, in the current Chinese art world, what is considered a new theory? This is a standard, and so-called objective criticism is the application of new theories.</p>
<p>China's democratic nation-building movement has had a history of several decades, and the historical task of this movement is to build a country owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people. The road of Chinese art cannot violate this requirement and be isolated. Therefore, to solve the problem of the way out for Chinese art, we must first see clearly what is the way out for China's construction?</p>
<p>What comes from this question is "self-expression". Because I am determined not to be absolutely divorced from reality. If you want to use art to transcend reality and escape into the mountains and forests, even if you express yourself, in fact, this is an escape from reality. What does this kind of self-expression have to do with the establishment of Chinese new art?</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of popularizing art, this has been prevalent in various art departments since the Anti-Japanese War and has been promoted with great effort. But the problem is not only about sending noble art to the masses, but the most important thing is how much relationship does this art have with the masses? In other words, has this art been established through the trend of the times, the requirements of society, and the lives of the people?</p>
<p>These many major premises have been determined. Naturally, there is no need to "imitate", and there is no need to make "fake paintings". From then on, Chinese art will not only "emphasize quantity" but also "emphasize quality". Then you can walk your own road at a steady pace and go on the road to revival. At this time, the new form of Chinese art will be successfully created.</p>
<p>The times are advancing. Chinese art workers can only face reality, meet the times, and strive to create, which is the current road of Chinese art.</p>
<h3>An Impression of Mr. Hai Su's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Feng Li</p>
<p>Upon entering the Chinese Art Garden, the atmosphere immediately changes, becoming one of clarity and aesthetic refinement. Chinese and Western paintings are displayed on both sides, seemingly without end. Next to the square pillars in the center are placed hollow magnetic stools, along with potted oleander and pomegranate flowers. Along the windows are benches, and opposite the wall are several flower baskets sent by others. Linen curtains divide the Art Garden. The wall facing a row of windows is entirely hung with oil paintings, while the rest are Chinese paintings. The first room is entirely filled with the Chinese paintings of Mrs. Liu, Xia Yiqiao, with each painting arranged in perfect symmetry.</p>
<p>I am not knowledgeable about painting, but this exhibition seemed to capture my interest somewhat.</p>
<p>I remember when I saw "Rui Mountain Misty Rain," I took several steps back to admire it, as if a gust of cold wind swept me into that misty rain.</p>
<p>Two paintings of "Fishing in Snow" express two different meanings. One peeks through mountain rocks at a paradise outside the world in the snow, and the other depicts the towering snow-capped mountains of Java.</p>
<p>"Tongjin River After Snow" consists of four paintings joined together, vividly depicting the green mountains and rivers of Jin after the snow.</p>
<p>There are several paintings of "Red Plum," some painted on gold paper, others on white silk. A larger red plum on gold paper is titled "Competing for Spring in Han Palace," and opposite it is a "Unrestrained Vigor," a pine tree on gold paper.</p>
<p>In "Startled Crow," a startled crow squats on a tree, its eyes piercing, while other small birds flee. Their panicked expressions highlight the crow's nonconformity.</p>
<p>The eagle in "Clouds Moving, Angry Wings Soaring Thousands of Miles" and "Rolling Horse" fully express the intense heat.</p>
<p>The "Double Horses" in the Chinese painting and the "Double Horses" in the oil painting are completely different in nature. The former expresses roughness, while the latter expresses tameness.</p>
<p>The Chinese painting "Cattle on a Hill" and the oil painting "Water Buffalo" both express the nature of cattle, especially the two water buffalo floating in the water in the oil painting, which better presents their natural state.</p>
<p>The oil paintings that impressed me the most were "Suti Dawn" and "Willow Forest Moonlight." I love the reflection of Suti and the light red sunrise, which send me infinite beauty and fun. I feel that "Willow Forest Moonlight" is not a willow forest but a coconut grove, thus filling it with the enthusiasm of a rendezvous after dusk.</p>
<h3>Portrait of a Noble Lady</h3>
<p>— Helbin</p>
<p>Holbein (H. Holbein 1497-1543) and Dürer are two outstanding talents of Germany. In their youth, they were very poor, merely painting illustrations for bookstores. Later, the literary giant Erasmus discovered his genius and gave him great encouragement, and soon he achieved great success.</p>
<p>His works are mostly portraits, with graceful lines, rich colors, solemn postures, and special attention to decoration. His delicate and exquisite brushwork can be called unprecedented. The work was originally stored in the Berlin National Art Museum. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p>— Zang Zan</p>
<p>When Millet's painting talent gradually revealed itself, his father took him to see Mr. Shanbu'er, a classical painter. This student of David exclaimed in surprise:</p>
<p>"It is a sin to keep this child at home."</p>
<p>Respect the child's wishes and let him go where he yearns to go. According to Dreiser: the home is not lovely, and people cannot be confined at home all the time; small trees near dogwood trees can never grow healthily.</p>
<p>Chicks cannot forever hide in the eggshell; small birds cannot forever hide in the nest. Birds are not born for the nest, but to fly in the blue sky and treetops. All learning is for life; also for the creation of life.</p>
<p>Like Tagore's childhood, when there was no school, he wanted to go to school very much. When he entered school, he wanted to leave again, although his grades were very good. We know how many people are wandering outside the school gate, and how many people enter the school and leave due to lack of economic support - today you come out of this art gate that everyone yearns for, I don't know how many envious eyes are on you.</p>
<p>This gratifying mood may not be understood by you, because you are falling into a state of anxiety and helplessness, unable to find a job. Of course, it is impossible to hide under your mother's wings or in her arms again.</p>
<p>Facing this real earth, what covers your head is no longer a roof but a blue sky or dark clouds. What caresses your hair and arms is no longer your mother but the wild wind or the sun. Everything presented outside the window: storms and thunder, rainbows and white clouds are for you to contact or communicate with. This world is vast and fresh, but there are also storms...</p>
<p>In the vastness, there are no walls, no restrictions;</p>
<p>In the freshness, there is the singing of birds, the fragrance of flowers, the sparkle of dew;</p>
<p>In the storm – there is nothing else, rely on yourself to fight.</p>
<p>Vastness, freshness, and storms have the same requirement - to become a real person, a real artist. Uphold that kind heart of yours, do not sell yourself, do not sell the art that everyone respects. The artist is the engineer of the human soul, the nurse of the human soul, the model of the human soul. — If you can't fix the souls of others, you have to fix your own soul.</p>
<p>(If someone takes short-sightedness as reality; only seeks immediate gains, we don't need to talk about it here.)</p>
<p>The meaning of life is construction, not destruction and echoing destruction. Because the world does not only belong to you, it belongs to the entire past and future of mankind. Believe in the truth, believe that she has come to the sunlight of this world, believe that she is in your heart and will flow from your fingertips.</p>
<p>Five years, ten years, twenty years will pass in a flash. The past prepares for tomorrow's departure. Everything is for tomorrow's departure. Ahead is the ocean-like deep blue, bottomless happiness and freedom, and the waiting storms, and all the lightning, fire and fighting.</p>
<h3>New Views on Bamboo Painting</h3>
<p>— Chen Dingshan</p>
<p>The recluse Dingshan once claimed that his poetry was first, his cursive script third, with nothing in between. In recent years, he has devoted himself to painting bamboo without stopping. Zhou Zi bowed to the flower and went on to say: "Mr. Dingshan's painting of bamboo, combines poetry and calligraphy, and can be ranked second, completing the three perfections." Dingshan threw his pen and said: "It is difficult to say, difficult to say."</p>
<p>In the past dynasties, the painting of bamboo was divided into two schools: Dongpo and Yuke. Dongpo was the literati school, led by Zhao Ziyang and Ke Danqiu, weakening by the time of Wang Mengduan. The Yuke school was the realistic school, led by Li Xishi and Xia Zhongzhao, ceasing by the time of Wen Zhengzhong. The bamboo paintings of the Qing Dynasty all followed Shi Tao, breaking the traditional methods of bamboo painting. In the contemporary world, only Wu Zishen still retains the scale of Xia Taichang; Wu Hufan draws from Zhao Zhongmu, and Yu Yueyuan painstakingly studies Song Zhongwen, all of whom are excellent bamboo painters. Zhang Daqian separately originated from Jin Dongxin and developed a profound understanding, being outstanding and unconventional. Ye Yuhu is good at painting small bamboos, and his brush tip has a kind of vigor, very similar to Nan Yue Wang Tuo. The old man takes his own fun. In terms of conformity, it is also like Zhongwen. Wang Jiqian studied with Wu Hufan very piously, but his bamboo paintings are said to surpass his teacher. In my opinion, his wife Zheng Yuansu's bamboo paintings are worthy of Guan Daosheng. Ying Yepin's bamboo paintings strive to improve, but the domineering spirit has not been removed, and there is Shi Tao in his womb. Tang Yun uses Hua Xinluo's method to paint bamboo, with a few leaves on a stem, showing the excellence. Other capable people such as Feng Chaoran and Wu Daiqiu, unfortunately, had regrets in painting bamboo, so I will not discuss them. As for me, how dare I boast? Zhou Zi said: "I have followed Dingshan for thirty years and have never heard him comment on people. I dare to record it in retirement."</p>
<h3>On Observing Daqian's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Jiang Suchang</p>
<p>It is rare for talent to be versatile and enter the sacred realm. Everyone in the painting world praises him and he becomes a legend. The atmosphere is dark and chaotic, but looking around, everything is dazzling and bright. The stacked walls seem to still be damp, with misty scenery and lush vegetation. The setting sun casts half its light, creating illusions of brightness and darkness, while the morning haze spreads horizontally, rising into clear light. Reed banks and a single sail hang, and the sound of bells pierces the forest doors. The mountains and rivers of ten thousand miles are reduced to inches, and lying down to travel does not make one feel thirsty or hungry. The painting world has passed Guo Zhong and the clothes and hats have been restored to the ancient system. The slender and graceful woman has beautiful eyebrows. The emerald feathers and pearl sleeves dance rhythmically, and the Cao Yi Wu Dai are like real concubines. The vivid and boneless style captures the original, and the red and purple colors compete for fragrance. The phoenix curls its whiskers in the gaps, and the jade swallows steadily step on the school. The sea chart and caisson ceiling are carefully organized, and the ingenious craftsmanship cannot be applied. The ambition is focused on gathering all the wonderful things, and it is not enough to compare the north and south schools. What strange thing can one do to achieve this? Yuan You and Er Lao respect their teacher. Five vehicles are broken and the six methods are understood, and the drama traces the sky and the earth. Don't talk about unfolding the Tianzhu scroll, and storing the five mountains in the chest to explore the wonders. Bo Ye is of the same spirit and should be the leader. When the wind blows through the valley, he should be the one to respond. How can the fragmented world be restored? Hurrying to the Shu Road, crying for help. Some people carry spears and kill enemies at will; there is enough grain in the orchid ridge west of the slope. The passes are barren and cold, opening up a foreign land, with yellow sand, white grass, and red willows. Wu Liang A Kongbo stone carvings, stone caves groping for silk. Forgetting the cold and hot, taking from all sides without being tired. Mica powder and milk rabbit hair are used; cinnabar is settled and light rouge is used. Azurite gold mud are also collected, and there is nothing that can't be used to assist the eternal ink. What is this foresight, strong and brave, taking on the great task of eight generations of decline? Ignoring the Song and Yuan Dynasties, let alone the later generations, smelting the present and melting the ancient heart is hammered. The glass scene captures the tiger's essence, and the world is trending towards shortcuts, how can it not be wrong. Uniquely opening the atmosphere and marking the right direction, both heaven and man achieve meritorious deeds. From the beginning, a great name is not in vain, and the price is worth ten thousand yiks, what is surprising? Beautiful beard, not yet old, pleasing the nature and comparing to Da Chi. A thousand autumns have long been brewed out of the head, a promise does not hesitate to let the god come and wave; the object and I do not change the inexhaustible treasure, and the recluse will return to the mountains!</p>
<h3>Chinese Painting in the Last Hundred Years</h3>
<p>— Chen Yishi</p>
<p>Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty said: "The so-called painting is the same as the six classics, and it runs parallel to the four seasons..." The rise and fall of a generation is related to literary fortune; the prosperity of literary fortune is often reflected in painting. The "Thousands of Chariots and Ten Thousand Horses Surrounding the Pagoda Three Times" of the Baima Temple, its majestic simplicity, is enough to show the spirit of the Han Dynasty's unification of the world and the prosperity of literary fortune. Thereafter, such as the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the Northern and Southern Song Dynasties, the Ming Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty, all had their own distinctive characteristics of the times. Looking at the end of the Ming Dynasty, people with integrity had repressed emotions and poured out their unrestrained spirit in the blue and green. This was unique, forming a style of the times, making the division between our country's court paintings and literati paintings more distinct. However, from the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, for more than a thousand years, Chinese painting has undergone several transformations, and from a social point of view, it can still be said to be a long-term fixed era. By the time of the Opium War during the Daoguang period, and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, all national consciousness and social life underwent drastic changes. Academic thought, religious customs, scientific spirit, etc., directly and indirectly, had a great and significant impact on Chinese painting. Since the founding of the Republic of China, transportation has become convenient, the distance between East and West has shortened, and cultural exchanges have become closer, which has led to more schools and diverse factions in painting in the past hundred years, making it difficult to reach a consensus. The chaotic and complex situation is rare before the past hundred years. In terms of calligraphy, before the Ming and Qing Dynasties, those who studied calligraphy adhered to the Pavilion Posts. After the middle of the Qing Dynasty, scholars copied from bronze and stone rubbings. From then on, calligraphy opened a new path, and painting was greatly influenced by it. Therefore, painting had a fashion of the spirit of bronze and stone. In modern times, Wu Changshuo is one example. The complex evolution of the Chinese painting scene in the past hundred years has been described above. We can infer from this that the painting of the past hundred years has a trend of epoch-making significance, not only because it has research and sorting value in fine arts itself, but also because it can serve as a reflection of the historical era on the entire culture. The Shanghai Municipal Education Youth authorities and the art community, in view of this, during the symposium of the Shanghai Municipal Art Museum Preparatory Office, unanimously agreed that it is necessary to systematically study this epoch-making century of painting. We should know that Chinese painting has the glory of a long history. If we extract its advantages and analyze it systematically from the complex and diverse painting styles of the past hundred years, it will not only honor the past but also benefit the future. Mr. Zhang Binglin once said: "Confucius did not write the Spring and Autumn Annals, the predecessors could not tell the posterity, and the posterity could not know the predecessors." Therefore, I wrote a few words to show that we must not forget the great task of the Spring and Autumn period of the current painting scene.</p>
<p>Sunday Chat</p>
<h3>Japan, Japan!</h3>
<p>— Sea Breeze</p>
<p>Professor Copeland, the Australian Minister to China, mentioned the Japanese issue. He said, "In the past month or two, Chinese newspapers have gradually expressed concern about the current situation in Japan. The Chinese seem to feel that Japan's current development poses a threat to China."</p>
<p>It has been less than two years since Japan surrendered, but how can the Chinese people not care about the tolerance and indulgence of Japan by the Allied Commander MacArthur?</p>
<p>Japan's foreign trade has formally recovered. In China - when all light industry and textile industry have not yet recovered two years after the war, as a news agency in Tokyo sent a telegram: "After the resumption of Japan's private foreign trade, the conflict of interest between light industrial products and China's foreign trade is the greatest."</p>
<p>As for the United States has allowed Japan to whale in Antarctica; opened Anga Island to allow Japan to take phosphate ore; Japanese fishermen asked to fish in the Kuril Islands; the United States, regardless of opposition from all sides, actually implemented it, not only ignoring the protests of Britain, Norway, and Australia, but also seemed not to consider China's current situation and interests, what is this for?</p>
<p>And one of the most absurd so-called "China experts" in Japan, Dr. Komiya Yoshitaka, a former member of the Shanghai Scientific Research Institute, even declared: "Japan will assist in China's economic recovery." His reason and deduction is that everything in China is inferior to Japan, so China has not stopped expecting Japanese leadership.</p>
<p>How are these remarks different from the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" advocated by Japan when it invaded China and the Far East? What are the wise Allied Commander MacArthur's thoughts on the so-called rhetoric that Japan has destroyed all militaristic ideas two years after the Allied occupation?</p>
<p>However, how does the United States view the post-war Japanese issue? Let's look at the remarks made by Howard, the American press tycoon among the American reporters visiting China, and we can know.</p>
<p>He said: MacArthur's control policy is very wise; the United States can not afford to feed Japan for a long time, so it supports Japan's small industry and allows fishing. As for fearing that Japan will make a comeback, China does not need to worry, because the United States will certainly monitor it closely.</p>
<p>Here, we do not want to draw conclusions, please let the reader judge for themselves.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Desolate Artist - In Memory of Liu Baoquan</h3>
<p>— Sikong Wuji</p>
<p>Among my contemporaries, the two artists who fascinated me most were Fanghua Juedai's Mei Lanfang and Liu Baoquan, who died in old age.</p>
<p>I once used two lines of poems to praise them. Mei is: "Occasionally competing with the world for wealth, all flowers bow to the spring breeze." Liu is: "The setting sun and the residual light, the mausoleums and towers of the Han family." The former is graceful and luxurious, and can be compared to peony. The latter is like the reeds by the Miluo River, making a rustling sound in the twilight autumn wind, which evokes a sense of desolation.</p>
<p>When I picked up my pen to recount Liu Baoquan's desolate life, I couldn't help but feel a lot of emotion.</p>
<p>It is difficult to verify the childhood of this drum king.</p>
<p>In short, his sandalwood board career started very early. In the social atmosphere of the late Qing Dynasty, people always looked down on actors, and those who sang big drums were even lower among the actors. As Taishigong said, "The actors are kept, and the popular customs are planted." Artists who live in this land of fame and fortune can only be insulted and damaged. I often fantasize that if the great British writer Shakespeare was born in China, his status would not be as popular as Su Xiaoxiao, a prostitute in Qiantang.</p>
<p>Baoquan did not have the opportunity to receive the education he should have received like the children of those high-ranking officials and dignitaries. (Today's education is no different. It is: "The school and institutions are open, and those who are ambitious but have no money should not enter.") But Baoquan rolled countless times in that bloody reality, and he experienced all the cruel humanities from real life. He has insight into the world, he has a kind and upward heart. Although he can't stand this bizarre society, he finally endured it. For life, in order to get the most basic life from the leisurely flames.</p>
<p>Kant said: "Genius is born. Genius cannot be purely based on learning." Baoquan is qualified in that the creation of genius cannot be expected by people.</p>
<p>However, people are always inseparable from the soil of reality. Genius only refers to his strong sensitivity to people.</p>
<p>In the smoky world, even the most upward people will inevitably have a spiritual nap. Baoquan became addicted to opium when he was famous and called Xiaoshiquan. Every era has its own different moral concepts. Smoking opium was as common in the late Qing Dynasty as smoking paper cigarettes today, and it is not enough to be criticized.</p>
<p>Chinese people have the most shameful habit, that is, they accept pain and misfortune from the previous generation without any change, or even more severely, and hand over the pain and misfortune to the next generation. The father slapped his son in the face, glared at him, and blew his beard and said, "Dare you not listen? When I was thirty years old, your grandfather still beat me!"</p>
<p>I naturally refer to this shameful habit in general. Any kind of character must jump over selfishness and be able to sacrifice oneself for others to achieve its greatness.</p>
<p>Baoquan had a child, and he looked back on his career, being despised in society. He didn't want to continue this father-passed profession. He hoped that his child would no longer be insulted, could glorify his family, and could step into the "upper class"; we cannot sing high praises and criticize whether this view is right or wrong, because it is natural for the oppressed to want to stretch their waists.</p>
<p>Baoquan's self-consciousness made him exhaust his meager income to cultivate his children.</p>
<p>The child grew up day by day, but he not only could not understand his father's good intentions, but even hated his "drumming" father. He thought his father's profession damaged his honor.</p>
<p>Education, education. Did the education of the "upper class" deprive Baoquan's son of his humanity?</p>
<p>Like all true stories, I have no way to describe that long and arduous life. (To be continued) Japan Promotes Hunger Exports</p>

<h3>Alishan Sacred Tree</h3>
<p>— Mai Jiyu</p>
<p>"Sacred Tree" is not mysterious, but a miracle. It is the oldest red cypress in the Alishan primeval forest. Although this old man has been weathered, he is huge and towering, with a dignified appearance, which makes tourists feel respectful. Therefore, the Japanese call it the "Sacred Tree." I remember someone said: "If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the beauty of Taiwan. If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the greatness of Taiwan. If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the wealth of Taiwan." But I have to add another sentence: "If you haven't been to Alishan, you don't know the miracle of the Sacred Tree."</p>
<p>After the "February 28" incident in Taiwan was quelled, I decided to go to Alishan to reverently worship the Sacred Tree as a memorial. At that time, tourists were traveling because the Qing Township work had ended since Chairman Wei's arrival in Taiwan, but the perpetrators of the past were still lurking in the Central Mountain Range, occasionally shooting and killing mainlanders. Due to the lure of the Sacred Tree, I dared to gamble with my life.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 2nd, Mr. Zhang and I took a small train from Chiayi City to Alishan. The military rail is small, it is a special mountain-climbing train, only dragging three narrow carriages. Most of the passengers are those who bring goods and walk alone, because they can get a loan on the top of the mountain, so chickens, ducks, groceries and I are crowded together, which is very disappointing. In the whole car, only Mr. Zhang and I are mainlanders, and the rest are speaking Taiwanese, if another vendetta is provoked, we will definitely be mashed meat.</p>
<p>After the train passed Zhuqi, it slowly climbed uphill, gradually following the mountains and winding upwards. The deep forest and valleys are elegant and fascinating. We looked out from the window, as if riding a motorboat floating in the air. Giant rocks, small mounds, misty trees, and cloud streams are all under our feet. The price is layers of strange scenery, which is amazing. At one o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at Fenqihu, because the elevation above sea level has exceeded two thousand meters, so the climate has turned cold, and the clouds are like a large army roaring, and the layers are swallowed down. In addition to the drizzle, the train is like bathing in the sea of clouds; we passed through 63 tunnels along the way, and at four o'clock in the afternoon, we were finally pulled off the train by the Sacred Tree Station where I admired the Sacred Tree, which is only two kilometers away from the Alishan terminal.</p>
<p>The huge and unparalleled Sacred Tree is right next to the station, standing like an old soldier with an arrogant bone. It is protected by wooden fences all around, as if afraid that people will damage the old man's skin. The surrounding forests are lush, with red cypress, flat cypress, pine, cedar, plum, etc., towering among each other, as high as the sky, all two to three thousand years old, like giant old gods, guarding the Sacred Tree; looking at the branches and leaves of those old men from afar, they densely cover the sky, turning into various grotesque shapes, rising from the wilderness with the gray mist, is a layer of dark veil, covering the whole view of the primeval forest, and weighting it with its mystery and gloom. Vast and lush, we seem to be in the Congo of Africa.</p>
<p>But the most outstanding in the primeval forest is naturally the Sacred Tree; it is a 3,000-year-old red cypress, this tree is 53 meters high, the bottom circumference is 34.3 meters, and it takes more than 30 people to join hands to embrace it. In our mainland, I am afraid no one can see such a big tree!</p>
<p>Too excited, I knew Mr. Zhang was wandering around the old man's trunk, looking up, sometimes emotionally excited, and couldn't help but caress its scales and skin; it has been living here for three thousand years, resisting the wind, rain, earthquakes, and lightning, and standing unharmed, who of us who are fifty years old and know our fate can witness its end?</p>
<p>The Sacred Tree has always been silent to us, it knows too much! The world is long, we go on from generation to generation, but this old man has seen the ancients and will see the future; it is indeed the spirit of Alishan, and the disturbances of the island will be sublimated to the boundless sky with its sublimity.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of Scholars</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Scholars are mostly "poor," which has been the case since ancient times. It is even more so now! The so-called friends who hold pens and consider themselves cultured, though confined to small rooms, barely clothed, and without enough to eat, still rack their brains and squeeze milk all day long. However, the treatment they receive is so meager and pitiful that it is unimaginable! Many writers can hardly maintain their personal lives, let alone support their families. Since ancient times, those who reached the end of their roads were always scholars in blue robes. Who would have thought it would still be the case now! Are cultured people destined to have a "bitter life" forever? According to news reports, a cultured man named Wang Changzheng, because his income from desperately submitting articles was insufficient to live on, procured a pistol and robbed the Shanghai Bank. As a result, he was arrested, sent to court, and sentenced to seven years. According to Wang's declaration in court: "I did not want to rob money, but by committing a crime and going to jail, at least I can solve my personal life, because I cannot survive even by submitting as many articles as I can." The lament of a cultured person at the end of his road, who wouldn't feel moved and shed tears of sympathy!</p>
<p>The government has failed to protect the cultural sphere, and the cultural sphere has failed to help cultured people. This is a disgrace to the Chinese cultural sphere! I hope that my colleagues in the cultural sphere will work hard to expand culture and strive for survival, so as to properly end their careers and wash away their shame. Otherwise, the decline of cultured people will mean the hopeless survival of cultural undertakings! Therefore, I loudly appeal and write this article to awaken the vigilance of my colleagues in the cultural sphere.</p>

<h3>Ye Gongchao, This Person</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Now, perhaps we should call him "Vice Minister Ye" - but if we really called him that to his face, I know he would be unhappy. It's more appropriate to call him "Mr. Ye" in person, and "George Yeh" behind his back.</p>
<p>Why? Let me tell you;</p>
<p>Last winter, when I visited Mr. Hu Shih in Nanjing, and mentioned Mr. Ye, our Ambassador Hu smiled and said a wonderful thing - "Oh, isn't Mr. Zi already a very high official!"</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Ye was the Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and now he is the Vice Minister. Following Mr. Hu's tone, he should indeed be a "higher official". However, since the beginning of China, there have been many Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, but there is only one "George Yeh".</p>
<p>He is more than just a Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs!</p>
<p>For example, he is a Gentleman. Whether this word is translated as "gentleman" or "junzi," it is accurate for Mr. Ye. The so-called "gentleman" is definitely not just neatly dressed and courteous. Mr. Ye's generosity and sincerity are certainly beyond the reach of those who specialize in imitating Gentlemen's Gentlemen. There is a widespread anecdote about Mr. Ye at Tsinghua University: Mr. Ye has a rich collection of antiques, paintings, and books. It is said that if someone comes to his home and sees those antiques and really feels reluctant to let them go, as long as Mr. Ye sees that this person is indeed a connoisseur, he will often give them away immediately. But if you are just a snobbish vulgar person who talks nonsense, then sorry, he may give you a slap in the face.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can say that Mr. Ye has "three parts young master, seven parts famous scholar" air. Indeed, he often dresses impeccably, but it is not that he never appears unkempt: in winter, he wears a neat Western suit inside a fur coat (and the tie is always neatly tied); when wearing a long gown, he often does not button the collar, and recently a reporter visited him at the International Hotel and was shocked when he pushed open the door - it turned out that Mr. Ye was wearing clothes that looked like he had just been soaked in a vat! (Of course, this reporter was a "Mr." and not a "Ms."; it is said that Mr. Ye dresses for guests, and the guests were quite uneasy for a long time.)</p>
<p>However, if Mr. Ye sets his mind to dressing up, he can also be quite sophisticated! Not only is the whole body Immatcnlateto the last detail, but even when speaking, he does not use words carelessly. To give an example: he once said that although the Beijing dialect is quite beautiful and colorful, words like "压根儿 (yā gēnr)" seem vulgar and should be discarded.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye writes good prose, writes good calligraphy, and occasionally composes a few regulated poems with a strong Song Dynasty flavor when he is in the mood.</p>
<p>However, I cannot talk about poetry recklessly when mentioning Mr. Ye, because I know that what he hates most is "superficiality".</p>
<p>But, I have to talk about his English, let me borrow someone else's words -</p>
<p>One day, I was talking about Mr. Ye with Mr. Colin MacDonald, the former press attache of the British Embassy. Mr. MacDonald said seriously: "Mr. Ye's English is really perfect English!"</p>
