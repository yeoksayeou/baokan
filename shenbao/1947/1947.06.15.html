<h3>郵負責人談　郵政革新計劃　因經濟困難不能如期辦理</h3>

<h3>海南島建省問題的檢討</h3>
<p>醞釀已久的海南島建省問題，業經行政院政務會議決議：「先設立特別行政區，同時並組織建省委員會，籌備建省事宜，主委由行政長官兼任」。內政部乃會同各主管機關，起草海南島籌備建省方案，大體已吿完成，聞其內容，將行政區域劃分為三部份：（一）大陸部份，轄勾漏山脈以南十六縣：（二）海南島本島十六縣；（三）東西南中沙四羣島。至於行政長官的人選，大約亦已內定，不日卽可發表。由此看來，南國新型進步的省份，卽將出現；不僅全國朝野對此甚為重視，而且久經離亂的海南島人民，尤其寄以無窮的希望。所以海南島的建省，不僅是我國內政上的一大措施，而且也足以說明了政府已注意到這個南海問題了。</p>
<p>海南島亦名瓊崖，位於中國海，卽在南海之西北隅北緯十八度九分至二十一度十一分，東經一百零八度三十六分至一百一十一度三分之間。西隣東京灣，近接越南，西北約隔海峽十二浬，面對廣東省雷州半島，民航半日可達。稍北卽北海，較遠則東望菲律演，南控南洋羣島，其交通綫位於新嘉坡與香港之間，為我西南國際路綫上極重要之島嶼，其本島面積共二千六百方公里，較之面積二千三百三十二方公里的台灣，大二百六十八方公里。台灣形如甘藷，海南島略同形狀，經濟價值兩島相等，此在戰略上兩島儼如中國海之兩眼。如論其政制之演變，遠在二千年前內屬時，漢為擔耳珠崖二郡，隋增臨振一邑，同屬揚州；唐改為五邑，屬嶺南道。宋改設瓊州，隸廣西南路；元則改州隸屬湖南行省。明改行省為布政司，分為三州，改隸廣東。淸設海南道，下分瓊崖二州。民初循淸制設瓊崖道：國民政府成立廢道設縣，劃本島為十三縣，後增三縣，共計十六縣，為廣東省第九行政區。民國廿八年二月十日，日本佔領該島，銳意經營海港，掠奪其資源，致該島精華喪失，民力疲敝。勝利復員後，廣東省管理欠周，吏治黑暗，盜賊蜂起，陷全島於悲慘之境。加以法侵西沙，越南紛亂，台灣不安之際，與廣束一衣帶水之隔之海南，共地位之重要，其形勢之岌岌可危，如不急起治理，安揖流亡，徐圖開發，前途實憂患可慮。</p>
<p>海南島基於以上情勢而設省，自有重大意義，此不僅為該島人民之要求，抑日為全國人士深切之期望。惟地方政制之建立，經緯萬端，往昔如西康之建省，綏遠熱河察哈爾之建省；近如東北九省及台灣之建省，均因區劃未周，政制紛亂，爾後發生許多問題，莫可究請。吾人懲前毖後，原則上主張海南島之建省，在辦法上步驟上，主張廣徵博取民間及專家意見，依步驟依計劃，徐圖完成，不可汲汲也。茲抒有關該島建省事項數端，期諸當局能注意及此。</p>
<p>一·特別行政區制應玫慮攷查特別行政區制，為不合理的省制；往昔察綏熱設特別區，及年前台灣設行政長官制，本為權宜辦法，對地方自治亳無貢獻。察綏熱設特別區，因有蒙漢種族及縣治未立諸關係，後省組織法確立，特別區卽慶除。台灣採行政長官制，形成特殊制度。為台人反對，近已取消，改設省制。海南島縣治設有卅餘年，海南島與台灣一海之隔，台灣已試騐失敗之長官制，似不宜冉行於海南。吾人以為海南建省，可循之步驟有二：（一）採西康建省委會過渡設省辦法，設海南建省委會，直隸行政院，籌備建省：（二）確立行政區域後，宣佈建省。</p>
<p>二·行政區域應確定所謂行政區域，卽省之轄區，如市縣設治局等。政府對於海南設省之重婪意義，勢在確立南海各島嶼之管轄，置各島嶼於省制之下，本為朋智之措施。惟查南海各島，屬於中國主權者，有東沙·西沙·中沙·南沙。團沙羣島及斯巴特萊島，且均富有戰略價值。當中日戰爭時，東沙西沙及斯巴特萊等，先後被日本佔領，劃歸台灣的高雄管轄。日本投降後，我內政部將其劃歸廣東省管轄，已經省政府會同海軍當局接收，但未予治理。現在海南設省，以上各島應分別設置縣治，此不僅為省行政區域之確定，且為北緯八度，東徑一一一度至一一五度五分間中國主權之確定。</p>
<p>三·關於省之名稱海南島建省，依政府計劃，大約為「海南島」，甚有人主張「瓊崖省」者。吾人以為，每南島暨東少西少活島，位於南海，其領海領士均為中國主權，似宜以「南海省」命名為宜。向時為經營管理南海各島便利，將來省會以設榆林爲有利，與西沙近百四十五浬。</p>
<p>總之，海南島建省，爲必要之措施，建省早一日成功，外人卽少一日之覬覦。吾人以上所論，為建省當務之急，期望政府縝密研討，以底於成！</p>

<h3>美參院議長范登堡主張　設兩黨顧問委會　協助處理對處援助計劃　事前必須調查國內資源確定限度</h3>
<p>〔美國　　處華盛頓十三日電〕美共和黨參議員范登堡今晚稱：對付海外重建問題，應根據「兼　並　　基礎」，並建議：在美國國內設立一個兩黨顧問委員會，「作為一種協調之中心，並對於美國對外救濟事宜，向政府及國會提供意見。」范氏指出：關於檢討海外重建問題，「吾人不妨　歐亞兩洲之聯合國經濟委員會密切合作。」范登堡之薩明有云：「目下官方與私人方面所　　之對象，為戰後美國對外之大規模重建新計劃，以防止世界不少部份社會與經濟之崩潰，此項重建計劃有別於直接救濟之計劃。此等討論之公開進行，乃一佳事。但不論在國內或海外，此等討論不應加以誤會。在國內，此等討論不應引起一般之焦慮，以為吾人將草率從事或作威不合時宜之計劃。在海外，此等討論不應被人作為一種憑證，以為吾人之海外友國能依賴吾人以代替依賴其自己。但有一極重大之問題尚未解答。該問題涉及完成安定和平之條件。此等條件包括愛好和平之民族，必須達到自給自足之獨立，又包括美國自身之利益，此項利益決不能在破碎之世界中繁榮生長。余主張應付此一問題，必須兼籌並顧而不應頭痛聲頭。余汝認美國為本身利益着想必須以極大勇氣應付局勢。吾人必須統盤調查自己之資源，以確定吾人考慮對外援助之限度。此為光決問題，蓋美國若果放鬆則世界之希望，亦將隨之鬆弛。」</p>

<h3>三代表訪吳局長　陳述工商界困難　吳氏解釋恢復底薪不可能　照上月指數發薪將予考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會理事長徐寄　，理事金潤　及工業協會理事長吳蘊初，昨晨十一時往訪社會局長吳開先，陳述目前工商界之困難，提出四點要求：（一）工資恢復至二十五年時之底薪。（二）經濟動盪不定，工商產品計算成本困難，各廠商當月工資應以上月份之指數為準。（三）所有關廠解雇，應根據工廠法之規定處置，先予預告。（四）制止任意罷工怠工之非法行動。</p>
<p>戰前工資　不合水準</p>
<p>吳局長當一一予以答覆稱：（一）工人在當時租界統治時代，工資低微，生活多不合水準，現今社會局無理由再使工人回復此種生活。固然有一部份工人加得太多，但不可一概而論，故不能即要求一律恢復至廿五年時之底薪。（二）所提要求可予考慮。勞資評斷會將於下週召開會議，工業協會已有提案，待評斷會討論決定。</p>
<p>解雇辦法　可予考慮</p>
<p>（三）依照上海復員期間解雇工人辦法，解雇金之發給最少三月，多至一年二年或再過之。後經勞資評斷會修正為最少半月，至多三月，此舉為維護工廠，亦係一番苦心，工商界對當時不合理之辦法，未置異議，至今對已修正改善之辦法則感不滿，於情實有欠通。目前之解雇辦法，於工廠法固無依據，本人亦予承認，故依法而言，此點可予考慮。（四）制止工人非法行動事，日前已提出市政實議討論，市長及警察局皆予同意，已由社會局與警察局會銜佈告制止，相信以後此種情形即可減少</p>
<p>商談時，彼此甚為洽調，徐·金·吳三氏允將吳局長之意見轉達會員。</p>

<h3>地方會重整會務　昨日召開會員大會　促進繁榮為市民謀福利　將本過去精神協助政府</h3>
<p>〔本埠訊〕上海市地方協會昨日下午四時在中正東路浦東同鄉會召開會員大會，出席會長杜月笙，副會長王曉潁，錢新之，會員潘公展，黃炎培，陸京士，吳開先，徐寄　，駱清華，章士　等二百餘人。大會討論章程，選舉理監事秘書並通過宣言，至六時許始散會。</p>
<p>行禮如儀後，首由杜會長致詞，希望本會會員一本過去精神，協助政府，為本市之安定復興而努力。繼由徐　　會員報告會務稱：上海市地方協會之前身為上海市民地方維持會，於一二八戰起時由本市工商各界領袖發起組織，在地方秩序市面金融以及前綫軍需之供應各方面，應事實之需求，補政府之未及。迨後淞滬停戰，協定簽字，同人炯知敵人野心，方興未　，為求　勵奮發，集中力量，以為他日之謀，而備非常之變，　即改組為上海市地方協會。故以沿革言，本會固以抗日開其始，以意義言，本會固以抗日開其始，以意義言，本會工作不奮為民眾動員之先聲。自民國廿一年以後，至抗戰開始為第一時期，本會工作一面致力於社會事業，如兒童之教養，有閘北平民教養院，閔行廣慈孤兒院，如農村之改進，有高橋農村改進委員會。滬市民食。各項統計，分年　編，則有上海市統計委員會。而關於地方興革事宜，則隨時與公團協力促進。其時中央為預籌應付事變，施行公民訓練，本會率先提倡，一面復針對時局，靜觀演變，邀集有心人士，講演商討，提高等覺。抗戰既起，本會幾成為後援中心，救濟救護，本會幾成為後援中心，慰勞募捐，分別部門，各負專責。此外並以餘力，協助南北各戰場，救濟失業工人，鼓勵工廠及時內遷維持生產。及至國軍撤退，南北兩市渝人魔掌，社會長等先後被迫離滬，會務處理交由徐采丞主持。在荊天　地之中，繼續不輟，其間如各項公債之勸募，工作人員之掩護，緊急經費只籌措，內移者川旅之協助，淹留者生活之維持，以及與港渝兩地通訊繼之聯絡設置，雖在太平洋戰事發生以後，以迄敵人投降以前，委曲以赴，絕未中斷。而地方協會之名義，始終清白，迄未為敵偽所利用。蔣主席頒給敵方之受降訓令，即由地方協會聯系之秘書電台所傳達。勝利既臨，開始復員，由於會員長期分離，亟須重行調查整會務，　於去年二月十五日召開復員籌備會，會後重行登記舊會員，並吸收新會員，迄今新舊會員已有五百餘人。</p>
<p>報告畢，請吳開先，潘公展，黃炎培等相繼致詞，對於社會長領導工作，備加推頌，並希望地方協會繼續努力，復興上海。</p>
<p>繼即討論會章，通過「地方協會以協助社會建設，促進地方繁榮並謀市民福利為宗旨。「推選杜月笙，錢新之，潘公展，吳開先，王曉籟，水祥雲等三十三人為理事，未如山，楊蔭溥等十一人為候補理事，李石曾，于桂棠，王延松等十一人為監事，朱惠清等三人為候補監事，章士　為秘書長，負責實際工作。最後通過宣言。</p>

<p>華股昨人心翅俏，銀根唾手可得，港匯又漲、大戶落手做多，終吿步昂。市面一吿轉機，復多利多揣測，永紗漲停後有加價表演。新亞，商務，水泥，美亞，永公，信和均迫漲限。華豐蟄伏已久，昨亦重吿鋒芒，臨收時亦達限度。默察環境，業中人興致已高，惟業外游資尙未十分踴躍，前途仍待盤堅。</p>
<p>晨開以銀根吿鬆，開出見昂。遞永紗開後，由一九九號一四號一六三號一四六號二二三號一七四號二二四號進至六四二〇元。九七號六一號五〇號趁高了結，退爲六三〇〇元。二三號一五四號二三五號二二三號二三二號一六三號一四二號七六號六一號二四號一七三號七三號一五二號二二四號一五五號供進，二三一號並納現永紗。新亞由二號首先掛停，遞永紗漲到六六六〇元。現永紗亦由一五一號一五七號掛高至漲限矣。九八號八九號力售現永紗，一〇二號八五號六五號二一五號四七號三一號一九號二〇一號亦有脫手，十時二十分，回挫至六五〇〇元。一五五號九四號一一七號二三一號一五二號一五七號俱進，重又拉上·十一時四十分，二三一號一五五號一一號一五二號二二四號來進，商務水泥亦吿漲停，遞永紗遂宣告漲停矣。未幾現永紗加五十元有人需要，即交美亞由二七號掛漲停，永公遞交及現華豐信和同吿迫停。暗市中遞永紗更經九四號一五二號一五四號等爭購，收喊後高至六八五〇元以上。結果較前收計永紗美亞信和漲停，華豐漲停後微回，漲二成弱。新光永公景福各升半成，勤興中法新華漲一成，商務水泥新亞漲停，榮豐火柴麗安升半成，中紡統益大通中絲景綸內衣各漲一成有零，五和祗吿微升。遞交計永紗永公漲停？信和美亞華豐新光各漲一成弱，迄成半不等。景福勤興各升半成强，塲外各老股除閘北五洲尙平，餘均回漲。</p>

<h3>本市鋼鐵供應情況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處之調査，本市現時鋼鐵供應情况如下：（一）生鐵。去年曾一度鐵荒，價格飛漲經輔導處向各方治購。軍慶大渡口鋼鐵廠生織首批到滬後，市價即行穩定。繼由鞍山華北台灣三處生鐵陸續運滬，鐵荒問題，即吿解除，日後生鐵來源暢通，故滬上生鐵不致缺乏。（二）盤元。盤元爲製造各種針類及鐵絲鉛絲絞繩等之必需材料，過去亦曾一度缺乏，多數軋鋼廠乃利用廢鐵板代替，以應市面急需，但因成份不合長度不够，以致成品質量亦難達標準。惟最近上海鋼鐵公司軋鋼廠前在鞍山鋼鐵公司所定之元鋼一千噸，已陸續運抵上海，行將開工。又該公司平爐鋼亦將開煉，可自澆鋼錢作軋鋼之用，故盤元供應問題，當可解決。（三）各種建築用及機器用輕磅方元及竹節鋼料等，本市各軋鋼廠能生產者，僅數一部份之需要，大部仍賴外埠輸入，如東北鞍山即可大量生產。最近兩三月來，外貨進口者頗不少，淮多爲去年之定貨，此種材料國內已能自造，外貨輸入亟應禁止。（四）鐵皮。黑鐵皮及馬口鐵皮載至目前爲止，市上仍甚缺乏。在國內鋼鐵廠未有出品前，外貨入口不能避免，幸鞍山鋼鐵公司已準備在最近期間軋製第十六至二十六號之鐵皮，運滬供照。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售一〇三九〇疋，被單二六〇條內廠商申購十四戶，共五六疋，布號申購單三三四張，共九八三〇疋，被單二六〇條云。</p>
<h3>輸出寄售貨物　結匯期寬即卅天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲一九四七年二月十七日以前輸出寄售貨物尙未結售外匯處理辦法，昨特以第一〇二號通函，分發各指定銀行，略謂：査本行通函第九十一號所規定本年二月十七日以前輸出，尙本結售外匯之寄售貨物交付外匯期限，業已屆期。茲爲便利輸出商推銷寄售貨物起見，特再展延該項交付處匯期限，自本年五月二十五日起，以三十天爲度，逾期不再續展，務希轉知客戶切實照辦。否則審售貨物售淸後，交付外匯匯率，仍須按照本行第八十六號之規定辦理。特此通函奉達，至希査照辦理。</p>
<h3>茶市去化不早暢　外銷貨交易平淡</h3>
<p>昨洋莊茶市交易仍亟荏弱，若干家華商出口行，於日前購買之各項花色，刻下猶在趕辦打包等手績中，加以通朝天雨，活動之意，頻吿遜落也。至其趨勢，以執貨者人心尙堅，續呈盤旋狀態。各種內銷茶，本街店莊及客帮去化尙可，行情亦頗穩定。據業中人云：最近蘇州等地，對於低擋紅茶，復見靑睞，出價亦不苛刻，日內或可有相當成交。又悉：津帮需求不戰之絲茶芯，續因吐納談判，懸而不決，過程暫難明朗。</p>
<h3>呢羢又見高價</h3>
<p>昨呢羢市面，除夏令貨無變動外，秋冬各貨莫不高價迭見。棋　街帮大半不願出售，茶會上趨勢與常堅俏。在呢羢一碼掉換白米一担之原則下，各號隊均看紗市再見好面。然以來源不繼，存底缺乏，生產寥落，廠盤開價反　現貨爲昂。利買消息，籠罩市塲。</p>
<h3>國行貼放委員會　核准工貸卅億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委會工業貸款審査委員會，於十三日下午開第十一次會議，出席委員朱通九等共十九人。審査通過申請貸款案廿一筆，約計卅億元。又該會前爲討論審査工業貸款從寬從嚴之標準，經組織小組委員會，開會兩次後，擬就「中央銀行貼放委員會審査工業貸款案件處理程序」草案四條，亦經昨日審査會修正通過，送待貼放委員會核定云。</p>
<h3>公積金　不得併入資本</h3>
<p>提存公積仍應課稅</p>
<p>天津市商會頃奉直接稅局代電，以第一類營利事業公積金，應否援例以其三分之一併入資术計算，及該項年終提存公積金，應否併入純益額計課，修正所得稅法及施行細則均無明白規定。茲奉財政部直接稅署電示，公積金不得以其三分之一併入資本額計算，並不得於計算所得額時，將當年應提存之公積金，於純益額內先行减除課稅。商會已將上項指示，轉吿各業商遵照云。</p>
<h3>首批外銷絲綢　預算虧損七十億</h3>

<h3>戰火燎原的東北角　共軍傾巢而來　冀獲一逞　戰局在兩週內將有新開展</h3>
<p>— 長春四日航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>東北共軍所發動的夏季攻勢，很迅速的由松花江流域發展到遼河流域，像一陣逆來的風暴，席捲了松遠平原的富庶之區。經過一陣慘烈的破壞，東北就彷彿患了嚴重的癱瘓症，由這一個角度看共軍的攻勢，經濟及政治的意義遠較軍事重要。</p>
<p>歷史上的東北邊牆，常爲動亂的淵蔽，至今猶然。共軍在東北勢力的造成，端賴優越的農業經濟條件，在北部長流黑龍江，烏蘇里江，及松花江沿岸形成的冲積平原，沃野千里，農產富饒，素以「穀倉」著稱，壯丁軍糧來源無虞。由哈爾濱伸展兩翼，西至扶餘，東至延吉，恰成一個月牙形，虎視長吉地區的大門。哈爾濱先中共東北的司令台，由此發號施令，儼然是東北的「赤都」。</p>
<p>地緣之恩惠</p>
<p>由於地緣的恩惠，東北共軍能獲得外援，在以往的戰役中，曾發現少數韓共軍隊及蒙古騎兵，而在最近的攻勢中數目是激增了，預計總在十萬人左右，同時在國軍鹵獲的戰利品中，發現有蘇聯式的武器。</p>
<p>從道一次攻勢中，可以看出東北共軍是以長期消耗戰作　覆政府的軍事鬥爭，以空間爭取時間。同時，更發動經濟鬥爭，進行以戰養戰，共軍侵入到收復區，搶糧食，拐壯丁，實行他們的「淸野」政策。</p>
<p>東北共軍揚言佔領長春，會師洛腸，八月中秋節在山海關賞月，你看這是如何宣饞的口胃呀！</p>
<p>南犯三野心</p>
<p>據有軍事遠見的人推測：此次共軍南犯的企圖，不外有三：（一）自哈爾濱及大連，沿中長路南北夾攻，會師瀋陽，主要目的在牽制國軍接收大連。（二）打通外蒙至北韓的走廊，控制東北面積的四分之三，阻止國軍接收哈爾濱。（三）以全面游動戰打擊國軍野戰軍，同時作廣泛的竄擾破壞，陷社會於騷亂狀態，把東北變成陜北第二。國軍亦洞燭其謀，正積極佈署，最近即將展開大戰。此一戰役的結束期，短則兩月，長則二月。而交通的恢復，需時至少半年。</p>
<p>四月中，林彪死訊盛傳的時候，松北共軍就集結於哈爾濱松花江岸的地區，在楡樹，雙城，五棵樹一帶集結十萬之衆，番號是第一縱隊第一，二，三師，第二縱隊第四，五，六師，獨立第一師，獨立第二師，蒙古騎兵大隊，及一部份保安團隊等。大舉南犯的行動是已經決定了。</p>
<p>五月初，共軍源源經扶餘渡江，十二日共軍第四師及第五師進迫農安外圍，黄龍保衛戰於焉揚幕，但共軍進至北郊與守軍接觸，知守軍實力堅强，乃以一部兵力佯攻，主力則經長春縣西境猛撲長春東南之懷德，十四日開始攻城，共軍第一縱隊三個師及獨立第一師以車輪戰法更番攻擊，守軍三十師之一團浴血苦鬥，犧牲過半，於十八日長肖北面突圍，國長項殿元殉身。其第二縱隊與自四平進擾懷德之七十一軍八十八師遭遇於大黑林子地方，國軍倉促出擊，以寡制衆，復以地形不利，蒙受損失。共單乃於十九日午後攻佔中長路上之重鎭公主嶺，切斷長潘交通。以一部兵力北來牽制長春，大部兵力向南移動。</p>
<p>平梅綫共軍</p>
<p>共軍旣陷懷德及公主嶺，四平出擊的國軍，退守東遼河南岸拱衛四平外圍，共軍第一縱隊及第二縱隊，即分自伊通縣境渡東遼河，進迫四平。獨立第二師於二十二日攻陷伊通東北之變陽縣，復向吉海沿綫竄擾。獨立第一師及附屬部隊則盤據懷德，公主嶺，力嶺，長春之間。四平攻守戰於二十二日揭幕，四平外圍據點郭家店，十里堡，哈福，八面城，舊四平等地，均先後爲共軍攻佔，然四平終無隙可乘。迄廿五日午後，共軍又自四平外圍全綫後撤，繞道四平南犯，其第一一縱隊四，五兩師經四平西面進犯昌圖附近，第一縱隊一，三兩師，竄四平東南，威脅開原。四平外圍仍置有兩個師兵力。四平戰事甫吿緩和，平梅綫上又趨緊張。</p>
<p>平梅綫共軍集結八萬之衆，其番號是第三縱隊第七，八，九師，第四縱隊第十，十一師，松北獨立第二師，韓國獨立師，韓共李鴻先支隊，警一旅等，自廿三日起包圍梅河口，晝夜猛攻，至廿九日夜梅河口卒被攻陷，守軍一百八十四師陳開文部孤軍喋血，達成戰略上的最高任務。共軍佔領梅河口後，分兵兩路，一股南下會攻昌圖，一股又北上似欲進犯吉林。</p>
<p>三路攻吉林</p>
<p>長春外圍緊張之時，吉東共軍也開始蠢動。吉東軍區的共軍首領曹里懷，決定了三路進攻吉林的計劃。一路由江密蜂以北之地區進攻吉林，一路自白旗屯附近渡江，攻烏拉街，南下土門嶺，迂迴吉林。一路自蛟河經新店（吉林東南）渡江，進攻小豐滿。吉林外圍共軍兵力，約八萬之衆，計第六縱隊十六，十七，十八師，獨立第三師，警二旅，廿四，廿五旅等。</p>
<p>五月十四日淸晨，由江密蜂攻吉林之共軍，一部竄至吉林北十里之新吉林，與國軍隔江對峙，吉林方面可聞淸晰之槍聲砲聲。十四日下午國軍即渡江反擊，將共軍驅退至吉林北之大屯以北。由白旗屯渡江共軍，廿日晨攻佔烏拉街，但爲國軍阻止於烏拉街以南之綫，迄未得逞。共軍萬餘人携重武器自十九日起進犯小豐滿，連日猛攻，第二松花江東岸一帶戰事至爲激烈，共軍經以　，攻不逞，傷亡慘重，知難而退。自五月廿日迄今兩週，吉林外圍尙稱平靜。</p>
<p>疲師遭敗績</p>
<p>目前，其軍正以全力進攻昌圖，開原之議，再向前進，就是瀋陽的門戶鐵嶺，瀋陽已經作防守的準南。同時、遼南方面大運的共軍，也有了動作，先後在復縣及普蘭店都作過試探性的攻擊，顯然意欲造成東北的全面攻勢，可是共軍兵力分散至廣，現在已經是强弩之末了，如果能流竄到　陽附近，已經是疲億之師，自招敗績無疑。</p>
<p>總之，共軍此次攻勢，是傾巢而來，但求一逞，根本就放棄了後方。總動員的兵力，達卅萬人，但有作戰經騐的部隊，不過二分之一，其餘二分之一，是沒有戰鬥經騐的新兵，戰力非常薄弱。他們之所以能作廣泛深入的游擊戰，是因爲國軍苦於兵力太少，少得連內綫防守的兵力都感覺不足了。最近援軍正向東北運輸，戰局在兩週以後將有新的開展</p>
<h3>各方要求收回聲中　東方蒙特卡羅　澳門　香港六日航訊</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　程志政</p>
<p>上月卅一日國民參政會第十五次大會通過「及早收復旅大兩港及澳門」的議案，同時各省市參　議會也有收回澳門的決議，　粵省參議會和　各法團更組織　了一個「收回　澳門促進委員會」，研究具體方案，採取實際行動，可見收回澳門，已是全國上下一致的呼聲了。記者爲了考察當地情形，最近曾兩度赴澳，下面所記的，便是考察後的觀感</p>
<p>遭蠶食　領土斷送</p>
<p>葡萄牙人在十六世紀曾經顯赫過一個時期，那時他們的勢力，從歐洲伸展到印度，錫蘭，南洋羣島，直到西半球的南美洲，領域之廣，不亞於現在的大英帝國。西曆一千五百三十年（明正德初年），葡人派律首先來到懊門，後來葡人愈來愈多，先後强佔上川島，浪白濖，和馬閣廟等地，明朝旣然沒有力量把他們趕走，便折衷規定每年由他們納租五百兩。一八四九年（淸道光廿九年），澳門民衆，因葡人擅作威福，怨恨日深，殺死了第一任總督阿馬騮，葡萄牙政府借題發揮，向淸廷提出嚴重交涉，不但租金取消，連我國的海關也不能存在，到了光緒十三年，葡人看到中國憂患紛乘，便正式宣布澳門是他們的領土，一八八八年中葡訂約，中國允訐葡人專管澳門，但不能將此項權利，轉讓他國。這樣一來，雖沒有正式將澳門割讓，事實上漢門已變爲葡萄牙的殖民地了。</p>
<p>澳門和國父故鄕中山縣昆連，菊萄牙人的管轄範園，逐漸蠶食，幷沒有正式規定界址，淸末廷臣昏庸，對於澳門，認爲是彈丸小地，無關得失，在宣統元年中葡劃界條約中。又糊裏糊塗的失去了一大片領土，現在的澳門，面積已不在香港之下了。</p>
<p>煙賭娼　三大秕政</p>
<p>葡萄牙人治理澳門，一貫的是高壓作風並且爲了增加稅收，也就不　手段，雅都知道澳門是東方蒙結　　，以烟，賭，娼來號召遊客。適去雅片由專營局包辦，通衢僻巷，烟館林立，第二次世界大戰結束後，葡政府爲了避免國際譴責，令澳督於去年七月一日頒布禁烟條例，規定　禁售禁吸，並限令將存烟繳給政府，表面上他們是禁烟了，可是澳門人民，祗消拿錢向衛生局領得「許可證」，便可公開購烟，暢吸無阻。最妙的是政府利用沒收了的鴉片，再高價賣給領證的烟民，掩耳盜鈴的禁烟，反增加了他個的一　意外收入。賭　然是公開的，最豪羣的中央賭塲，呼盧喝雉，通宵達且，最是熱鬧，其餘大小購塲，全市共有五十多家，以審攤，銀牌兩種爲主，此外尙有山舖票，白鴿票，馬狗票　，花　新奇，每天開彩，葡萄牙人單靠賭塲，每月便可收入六十萬元，榨取僑民，從中漁利，居心何等惡毒。妓館分爲三級，上等的在福隆新街，福榮里，福　里，宜安街，蓬萊街和新街。中等的在新塡地街和夜明街，下等的在騎樓街，水手街。澳門政膚　着娼妓身上，又　進了不少的錢。</p>
<p>懼收回　色厲內荏</p>
<p>澳門的葡萄牙人在第二次世界大戰中，名爲中立，實際上盧盧助紂爲虐，日本人可以在國際飯店設特務機　，公然戕殺我方政工人員，這一筆血賬，正不知何日可以淸算，日寇投降後，葡萄牙人看看大勢已去，深恐我國武力收回，便從東非洲調來了許多兵，加強防禦，對於僑居澳門的中國人民，依然肆意壓迫，表示他們對澳門是決不放棄的。然而色厲內荏，終於掩飾不了他們內心的恐慌。說來有趣，他們對於檢査新聞，嚴厲得出乎常情，凡是有對澳門絲毫不利的消息，絕對不許登載，香港廣州的報紙，先要經過他們的檢査，才許發售，因此港粵報紙，常被沒收，甚至於爲了一篇「混血兒」的小品文，也把香港星島日報扣言，有一位西人投兩香港南華早報說：「澳門政府爲了你們登載中國要收回澳門的消息而將貴報沒收，但是他們爲什麽又准許澳門報紙登載中國收回香港的消息呢？」這番話也說得够幽默了</p>
<p>最近澳門政府鑒於我國收回澳門的呼聲日高，更感手足無措，除了加緊封鎖新聞外，又派了大批密探到中山縣和廣州打聽消息，還因報道失實而鬧了一次笑話，原來「民洽黨」領袖趙昱爲了想在澳門成立支部，帶了一批隨員到澳門視察，豈知下輸以後，葡探早已把他監視，當他在中央飯店接受當地黨員盛大招待的時候，忽然警局請他去談話，到了警局，局長便毫不客氣的限令趙昱即日出境，趙以「民治黨」領袖的要人身份，如何能忍受這樣的侮辱，便拿出外交部護照來據理力爭，結果葡人毫不理會，硬派了武裝警察將他圳解出境，後來趙到了廣州香港，招待記者，報吿受辱經過甚詳。實際上葡萄牙人驅逐他的動機，却是據報趙昱來澳和收回澳門有關，葡人的色厲內荏，又是一個明證。</p>
<p>人口減　寂寞凄凉</p>
<p>澳門在大戰期內，畸形繁榮，盛極一時，戰後居民紛粉內遷，澳門人口，由六十萬銳减到二十萬，並且所遷走的，又多是富商巨賈，澳門的繁榮，一會兒便隨着戰爭而消逝了。現在澳門的情况，寂寞凄凉，籠罩在極度不景氣的氛圍裏，烟是半公開的，姑且不談，最大的由央賭塲，門可羅雀，下注的都是勞動階級，五元十元，便算大數了。其餘賭塲，可想而知。妓女也大部份移往香港，茶樓酒館，顧客寥若晨星，無不以「割價」號召，眞有不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>因爲人口大减，市面裘落，高等住宅區的洋房，十室九空，闐無人居，租金的低廉，不言可喻，米·麵·蔬菜·魚·蝦，無一不比香港便宜。澳門是沒有靈魂的，他正向着沒落的深淵走去，也許是葡萄牙政權末日將臨的朕兆吧！</p>

<h3>奢侈品黃金朝代消逝了　金剛鑽供過於求</h3>
<p>金剛鑽在戰時曾經暢銷一時，現在這黄金時代快要過去了。工業用金剛鑽和首飾用鑽石的需求已經减少、價格日趨跌落。爲穩定市價計，金剛鑽的生產量或許有減少的可能。</p>
<p>工業用的金剛鑽在數年以前是奇貨可居的，現在却多到充斥於市了。此項工業在戰時極爲發達，現在已經到了供過於求的程度了。</p>
<p>首飾用的鑽石在最近數年中曾佔奢侈品銷塲的第一位，目前也變成銷路呆滯了。以上兩種金剛鑽衰落的原因，歸納起來有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）消費者手中所有的錢沒有以前那樣多。戰時因工資高昂，奢侈品市塲吸收了無數新的主顧，爭相　買金剛鑽。可是目前因爲工作减縮，新水階級的收入亦隨之减少，對於購買奢侈品沒有以前那樣踴躍了。</p>
<p>（二）隨着汽車，冰箱，傢具等物湧到市塲，消費者的錢的用途轉移了目標</p>
<p>（三）零售商店因貨物增多，不像戰時那樣努力推銷金剛鑽。</p>
<p>在戰前，珠寶商的鑽石銷售量平均佔金部營業額的百分之十，　時因其他商品奇缺，突然增加到百分之四十至五十。</p>
<p>佔全世界金剛鑽生產量最大部分的美國，價格一致趨跌。零售價格較去年的最高價跌落百分之十五，批發價格跌落百分之二十，細鑽石約跌百分之十，但下等鑽石跌去百分之三十。</p>
<p>零售商手中存貨充斥，同時銷路呆滯，在這樣的情形之下金剛鑽的價格自必趨向下游。</p>
<p>控制全世界產量百分之九十五的金剛鑽同業組合，刻正採取預防措置，以防止價格再度下跌。</p>
<p>同業組合用以穩定金剛鎭市價的主要方法是頭像生產量。該組合提議將本年度組金鋼鑽的供應量限制到一九四六年度的百分之六十。金剛鑽琢工和磨工已經同意合作，實行减縮工作時間。</p>
<p>藉調節生產量以統制金剛鑽的價格，這是該業五十年以來的一種特徵。這不但保護同業的利益，亦且爲顧全金剛鑽持有人的利益，因爲人們購買金剛鑽的動機之一是要保持一份價値高昂而可以隨身携帶而沒有貶値危臉性的財產。</p>
<p>美國鑽石商現正發動一種運動，要求取消百分之二十的金剛鑽稅，因爲這種稅影響貴重賽石的銷路。</p>
<p>金剛鑽的跌價不是一種慘象，而是回復正常馱態。目前金剛鑽的銷路還是比較戰前好。金剛鑽同業組合的世界銷售總額，在一九三七年是三七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，一九四二年是四二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，一九四六年是一二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>全世界金剛鑽的供應，大部分受倫敦同業組合的統制。該組合大半田英國，南非及比利時的資本組成，軍事開採比屬岡果及南非聯邦的礦山。</p>
<p>在南非坦噶尼加，巴西，委內瑞拉等處，雖有單獨開採金剛鑽的，但教量徽小、不足以威脅倫敦同業組合在世界市塲的優越地位。</p>
<p>因爲金剛鑽的生產受着嚴格的統制，暫時的供過於求不久就會調整的，同時金剛鑽的價格將趨於穩定而不致繼續下跌。（譯自五月六日「世界報吿」週刋）</p>

<p>中國藝術往那裏走</p>
<h3>自然藝術</h3>
<p>— 李石曾</p>
<p>這個題目太大，不知從何處說起，只好限於我的一種觀念，或者也可以說是中國藝術途徑之一，就是我所謂「自然藝術」或「自然畫」，或「天然畫」；也可以說是「不學而畫」。我曾作了不少的試騐，有人同情於我這「不學無術」的畫麽，一笑！</p>
<h3>把自己靈魂放在畫裏</h3>
<p>— 方君壁</p>
<p>我國歷代在藝術上都留有許多燦爛光華的作品。直至今日，別的東西我們一切不敢與外國比並，而古代的文藝却可以之自豪，對人家講起來，還能覺得無愧，使我們在世界文化上尙有立足的地位。我們應該如何的感謝我們的祖宗！我們應該如何的努力來保護及發揚，加緊繼續他們所未了的工作！可憐這百餘年來，我們不但沒有發揚，沒有加緊工作，述保存的責任都沒有盡到，不但不能保存，尙且有時還加以破壞，想想這是何等的不肖而對不住先人呢？</p>
<p>「努力圖存」，在這個競爭的世界裘，不獨國家如是，藝術亦如是，我們不一定要崇拜外國，亦不一定要模仿古人，就畫而論，無論西洋畫法，或是中國畫法，都不過是一種形式和工具上的分別。畫家們可以任意選用，作爲表現他的感想；如果感想是眞誠的，則隨便以那一種工具來表現都可以成功。所以無論所作的畫，是簡，是繁，是寫意，是象徵，是有法，是無法，祗要出於眞誠，都可能成功一個不朽之作品。眞誠是什麼？是發揮自己的心靈，不模仿，不抄裂，更不要竊取。把自己整個靈魂放在畫裏，落筆時，需摒棄一切利害之見，派別之分，那便無所顧忌，而不至於想投和世俗之好，或受某種壓力利用了。除了「眞誠」之外，能加上詩，詞，音樂之陶冶、道德文章之涵養，歷史可以增加知識，山水可以開拓胸懷，這樣有了一個完美的心靈，作品自然也隨之超脫。即使練習不多，功夫不够，總不至流於低級，卑俗。西畫也好，國畫也好，一卑俗低級即無可救藥。願大家團結起來，互相磋磨，互相勉勵，使中國藝術的前途發生輝彩，光耀於世界藝術之中！</p>
<p>「中國的藝術往那裏走？」</p>
<h3>讀萬鄭書行萬里路</h3>
<p>— 熊佛西</p>
<p>要回答這個問題，先應該問中國的藝術家往那裏走？我的回答是一句老話：「讀萬卷書，行萬里路。」說得更具體一點兒，今後的藝術家，一方面應該接受中西藝術的遺產，另方面應該走入人民大衆向人民學習</p>
<h3>春秋責備賢者　覺悟　悔改　努力</h3>
<p>— 陳士文</p>
<p>中國藝術已經走入衰頹的境地。原因非常複雜：戰爭，政治，經濟，時代，環境，都有極大關係。還有幾點，爲人所忽視的，略舉如下：</p>
<p>（一）工作的人多，懂得的人少。工作了許多時候，甚至工作到死，尙不知道自己走的路對不對。</p>
<p>（二）工作者，每多局於一時一地，限於一省一國，或拘於一人一派，沒有上下古今，東西中外，兼容並覽，截長補短的認識與能力。</p>
<p>（三）工作不是太濫，就是太嫩。</p>
<p>（四）遷就低級趣味。</p>
<p>（五）馬路上，客廳內，展覽會裏，書報雜誌上，甚至機關學校，幾乎全是月份牌一類的作品。</p>
<p>（六）有聲望的作家，造贋品，不以爲恥</p>
<p>（七）賣假畫，不犯罪。</p>
<p>（八）只有中國藝術品到外國，去換鈔票，沒有藝術品到中國來，供大家觀賞，研究。</p>
<p>（九）保存古物，欠周密愼重。</p>
<p>（十）美術館的建設無法展開。</p>
<p>（十一）政府顧不到藝術。</p>
<p>（十二）藝術批評變成了捧塲八股，一派濫調。</p>
<p>以上幾點是臨時想到的。作者本春秋靑備賢者之意，祗願讀者自己省察一下，希望能够馬上覺悟，悔改，重新望新的路上努力，那麽中國藝術有了新的生命，中國藝術就可復興。而且世界藝術中心也可以轉移到東方來。</p>
<h3>永遠「仿」下云嗎？</h3>
<p>— 談錦瀾</p>
<p>在法國，參觀過許多名作家的畫室，議現他們一個個都在拼命的埋頭硏究中國的藝術，想從中尋找維他命以滋補他們本身所缺的某部份原素。那種精神使我感到慚愧和不安。</p>
<p>他們把研究得來的統統用在自己的作品上去了——如馬諦司·裘非。戴司匹奧等。但，他們並沒有呌它做中國畫，中國彫刻。</p>
<p>而我們呢？</p>
<p>仿宋，仿元，仿石濤，仿四王，甚至仿馬諦司，仿卞卡索……愈仿得像，愈足以自傲，愈足稱大名家，愈成功。正如中國的政治一樣，昨天仿德意，今天仿英美，明日仿XX，你也仿，我也仿，仿，仿，仿下去，將來的中國的藝術將會變成一種什麼藝術，誰能替我答覆？</p>
<h3>走自己的路</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>在學習時代，跟着老師走，出了學校，跟世界名作家走，走倦了停住脚步，靜觀宇宙，體察萬物——眞的，美的取入畫面；僞的，醜的置諸腦後。</p>
<p>世界大，地域廣，許多肥沃的地區，正待着我們去開墾。</p>
<p>尤其是在無止境的藝海裏，任憑自由行駛，更不必隨波，也不須逐浪，像哥崙布一樣，總會有意外的新大陸發現的。祗要有毅力和恒心，走自己的路，不要走人家走的路綫。</p>
<h3>螺溪的艇</h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>天台山大而景散，游者每苦足力不給。劉阮仙去，桃源古洞早已雲封霧迷，不可復識。赤城落霞亦徒有虛名。惟高明寺上之螺溪，淸寄可玩，一峯矗立，溪水環之，上有枯籐下垂，故有釣艇之稱。</p>
<h3>普及藝術　大衆藝術化</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>中國藝術太貴族化了，大衆沒有財力去享受；中國藝術太微妙了，大衆沒有智力去欣賞。因此，藝術大衆化的口號，喊了很久。似乎要壓低了中國藝術的永準去遣就大衆，這等於削短了脚去穿鞋子一樣。因爲中國藝術比較任何國家的藝術品來得深刻，牠底動人美感的力量非常偉大！唯一的妙處便是在「超乎象外，得其寰中」，假使中國藝術用粗製濫造的方式去創作，養成低級趣味，那便失去了中國藝術的眞實價値，便失去了陶冶感化的微妙作用。</p>
<p>所以，中國藝術應該要普及到社會民衆去，「藝術大衆化」的口號改爲「大衆藝術化」。大衆沒有財力去享受中國藝術，我們只要消外內亂，安定社會，增加社會民衆的生產力量，提高社會民衆的經濟基礎，然後，衣食足而知禮義，禮義知而愛藝術了！至於大衆沒有智力去欣賞，那末，在社會民衆生活安定之後，先普及一般完善的敎育，（完善的敎育必有藝術敎育的修養。）再從多方面灌注藝術常識，政府經常的設置各種藝術機構，逐漸推廣，提倡，研究，使民衆去追求高深的藝術，不要壓低了藝衛水準，去遺就低級民衆。</p>
<h3>建立客觀批評</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>當代的藝壇，有着一個最大的缺憾，就是祗有藝人，沒有批評家；因此黑白混淆，是非全無。</p>
<p>藝人們多數祗求技巧，疏忽理論。產生的作品，重量輕質，反映着空虛，淺薄，低級的意識。旣不能爭取藝術應有的水準，更說不上進步！</p>
<p>常此以往，中國的藝術將沒落下去，擺不脫　的，配合不上新的，在　界藝術的面前，永久抬不起頭來。</p>
<p>倘要扭轉這個危機，我們祗有先建立批評，客觀忠實的批評，如是我言。</p>
<h3>藝術是教育</h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>不要走入低級趣味的歧途，藝術應該是反映現實，感化人民大衆的敎育</p>
<h3>安步當車</h3>
<p>— 劍華</p>
<p>一切科學都可以「天下一家」「世界大同」，不必有國民性；一切物質的文明和享受，也都可以「一視同仁」，「不分畛域」；惟有文學和藝術似乎非有點國民性不可。</p>
<p>現在我們不談文學，祗說藝術吧？一國的藝術自有它自己應走的道路，中間也不免常有跟着外國人跑跑的時候，不過跑到半路，往往是向後轉，仍回到自己的路上去。例如對中國繪畫上，六朝時代，受了佛敎的影響，畫家在畫佛畫的時侯，就用了印度的量染法。（張僧　畫一乘寺凹凸花）但是不久這種方法就不用了。在明淸之際，利瑪竇郞世寗把西洋畫輸入中國的時候，也有一部分畫家「棄舊從新」，參用西法，但壽命也並不長久，就是郞世寗自己，也不能不遷就中國畫法，而畫成一種中西混合的圖畫。至於近代的例子，尤爲　　，有多少留學歐洲，專攻西畫的人，回國以後，仍然畫圖畫。就是日本大家公認它自己沒有細術的，又是最最善於模倣的，但是無論日本人所賽的「南變」，咸所畫的「歐畫」，那種日本風味，無論如何是一望而知的。</p>
<p>現在世界上的藝術可以說只存了東西兩大派，西派以法國英國德國意大利爲代表，東派以中國爲代表。這兩派的藝衛，似乎都在「徘徊歧途」「莫知所從」。但情形並不相同。東派藝術是進入了象牙之塔，西派藝術是走出在十字街頭。東派藝術是「愁眉不展」「低頭喪氣」的在慢慢的散步；西派藝術是「横衝直撞」「不顧一切」的在開速度的吉普車，兩者之間，是各有好處，也各有壞處。你想呌吉普車跟着我們散步呢？還是想呌我們跟吉普車賽跪呢？</p>
<p>我想與其跟着吉普車去闖禍，還不如「安步以當車」的，走自己的略較爲保險。</p>
<h3>重量與重質</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>我是個音樂的工作者，那未，就以音樂說吧：我國的音樂經過了八年的抗戰，已漸爲一般所認識，呈着蓬勃的氣象，現在已進入了建國的階段，在音樂師資大量缺乏的目前，此後的音樂，重質固然要緊，而重量實在比重質更爲迫切。希望全國的音樂專科學校及藝術專科學校設有音樂科組和一般師範學校注意到這一點，使與人生關係最密切的音樂藝術更爲大衆化！</p>

<h3>向復興的路上走</h3>
<p>— 關紫蘭</p>
<p>中國藝術向那裏走？</p>
<p>向復興的路上去，向光明的路上走；</p>

<p>藝術家是人，是社會要的人，是中國社會裏的人。他需要生活於社會，他需要現實以及現實給他的評定。</p>

<h3>建立新理論　創造新形式</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>我認爲，欲求中國繪畫長進，首先必須革除「洋畫」這個似通非通的名稱。使國畫與所謂「洋畫」者打成一片，各捨其短，各取其長，內容上，外表上，都應該擺脫「擬古」，「倣今」，「保守」，「因襲」的惡習；共同建立新的理論，創造新的形式，如是，始能躍進到一個新的境界，產生出時代精神的嶄新的作品。</p>
<p>之，「逆水行舟，不進則退」。—國畫家永遠地成了古董掮客，「洋畫」家終身將爲洋貨的販子。</p>
<h3>合作與死亡</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>達爾文「物兢天擇。適者生存」的原理，在學術界奠定不拔的地位，一向被舉爲是生產學上的卓見，生物演化的原理。不幸，在昔日，或是現在，這個生物學的法則恒被人們運用諸社會學上，於是人羣的不能平等，有賢愚，有貧富，有飽食與飢寒的矛盾，也成爲合乎天演的，是應該具有的現象了。至於眞唯如此，社會才能進化，才能進步云。這種錯誤的見解，曾被學者所指摘。因爲在天演論下，認爲社會上的貧窮與飢餓的人羣是弱者，理應洶汰，認爲豪富，飽食的人們是强者，應該凌駕弱者之上，這樣的演繹，就肯定了社會現實，肯定了現實中的不合理的現象，阻礙人類求取平等幸福理想。</p>
<p>眞如黑格爾所言，凡存在的都是合理的，這曾帮助了希特動，而天演論之應用於社會發展中，也曾成爲納梓德國御定的人種學說的精髓。於是日耳曼民族要統治全世界，征服全世界，因爲他們是「最優秀」的民族。</p>
<p>所以，先見的社會學家，對這一個錯誤的運用都不放棄駁斥的努力，這也許是這次大戰的成就。近路透社電傳、支加哥大學敎授艾里確立了一種新學說，修改了達爾文的天演原理，認爲動物從事於合作，比較從事於反社會的舉動，來得更自然，動物包括（人類）的生活事實上受制於一條規律—就是「合作與死亡」。人類在個人、社會、國家、國際各方面趨向於良善，是很自然的趨勢，正與人之趨於智慧一樣</p>
<p>路透社對艾里氏的學說是介紹得十分簡單的，不過他已提出了最主要的一點，即生物現象中不合作者、恒皆滅亡。這給我們在讀克魯泡特金「互助論」後一個新的槪念，我們不論其是否能推翻達爾文在生物學所奠定的地位。祗是從社會發展的觀點言，這是對社會進化的正確的見解。尤其在此人的分化成爲嚴重的社會現象，人的關係成爲社會學應該深求之新的課題，以及國際紛爭正展開未已時，我們益感合作則共存，不合作則死亡，所以艾里氏的研究成果更値得我們重視與支持了。</p>

<h3>房東的嘴臉</h3>
<p>— 阿林</p>
<p>都市人口的激增，市區的未能向上向前的發展，使房荒一直在嚴重的鬧着、雖則失業與高物價逼走了一部份市民，但是因各地治安不靖，又遷來不少寓公之類，對銷了遷走的人口。所以每一個市民今天在職業問題以外，最苦惱的就是房子。今日不知多少人在被房東逼遷的情形下，感到無屋可住的威脅，也有不知多少人在東借西住的不得一日之安。這一方面固由於房荒，另一方面則有人爲的原因在，就是房東的貪圖非份利得。</p>
<p>我們知道高押低租是當前一般現象，有地產者賴房租收入是不能滿其慾望的，全仗高額的押租項費，這筆押項以暗息收入計算，就是一個十分可觀的數字。但是問題就出在這里，都市的百分之九十的房子是在一種「世居」的狀態下的，大房東或二房東不能向他們補收押頂費用，所以最後一策祗有逼讓和加租。</p>
<p>這樣一來，房子糾紛就嚴重的發生了。</p>
<p>當前。旣非大房東又非二房東的三房客的地位最爲苦惱，房東宛如債主，這付刻薄兇惡的嘴臉恒使二房客們心有餘悸。近月以來，法院中擁擠了房子的訴訟，這還算是業主與住戶的直接糾紛。最使問題嚴重起來的，要算一般中下層市民受二房東的壓迫了。不久前因逼遷竟有二房東戳死房客的慘劇的發生、等而下之，如延平路二房東催逼房客不走，打算「坐吃」，更是失常。</p>
<p>現在在直接加租以外尙有變相的加租辦法，即按宣物（米）繳租，有一房東要一公務員房客按月繳房租白米六斗，公務員難之，房東就責問他每月不是公家發了八斗配給米嗎？他不知道公務員一家食此八斗尙屬不够，這件事倒眞活描出一副房東的嘴臉來了。</p>
<p>關於這方興未艾的房租糾紛，市府曾請市參會議定方案，予以合理調整，結果議案保留，仍然沒有一個辦法。我們當然不以爲這里可見到置地產者的力量，但是我們覺得這是上海市民與食糧一樣感到最恐懼的問題，應該正視現實，予以救濟，不然觀近之糾紛頻仍，因而演成流血慘劇，這是影響社會的安定的。</p>
<h3>戰士授田</h3>
<p>— 謝濤</p>
<p>風雨終日，閒坐案頭無聊，翻翻書報，在「生活　報」中看到美國政府對退伍軍人所舉辦的一種彩券性質的優待退役將七授田的方法原來在加尼福利亞州和奧利岡州間，有一吐爾湖，因逐漸枯涸，露出大批土地，戰事期間，美政府利川集中拘禁日人的勞力從事　拓，開　成大小自六十一英畝，至一百四十英畝不等的八十六個農塲，勝利後，政府爲了優待退役軍人，並且利用這已壓成的熟地，乃宣布由退伍軍人公開抽籤決定，中獎者獲得一所農塲，不過限於有二年以上的農事經騐和擁有二千元現款者、（這是作爲建造住屋及墾殖之費用）並且聲明應征者須具有誠篤，節儉，戒酒，勤勞的性格。常我看到登載的一幀照片，是中獎的一對年輕夫婦偎倚的立在小邱上，俯噉着下面一片極目平疇，指點着計劇在何處建造他們的新居，滿目充滿光明與希望。</p>
<p>我們有的是極目千里的沃土，爲什麽不可以撥給我們的復員軍人呢？</p>
<p>劇譚]</p>
<h3>桃花扇</h3>
<p>— 馬高</p>
<p>這是流傳頗久的故事，會有過幾種不同的改編，即就同一作者來說，他就有桂劇和這次演川的話劇本子兩種。然而我們在這一新的改編里，很淸楚底，看出了作者在這避難不孫結識風塵知已的舊故事中加注了新血液。他把李香君悱惻纏綿的悲劇和她那個時代深深地構結在一起，明末昏　的政局，奸妄權臣的恃寵横行，欺下瞞上，魚肉黎民，喪節落水的種種醜態暴露無遺；同時對於民心民氣的不屈不死，對於義貞的李香君，對於不節的侯方域，對於兩面人楊文聰，分別給予歌頌與鞭笞。</p>
<p>但是我們很惋惜作者筆力的旁雜，在小的枝節上分散了觀衆的注意力，假使能在圍繞着侯李這兩個人物的中心事件上，給他們更多的發揮，尤其是侯方域的「變節」，要是能具體的顯現出事實，對他的前後矛盾的言行放在强烈的對比上，那末可以使李香君這個人物所受的苦難格外呌人感到寃曲。同樣，在導演的技巧上。也是這樣，甚至有許多地方令人有瑣碎之感，我想這原因就在於編導是一手執行的，在他個人喜愛的地方，無意中加重了煊染，次要的佔據了主要的位置。因而高潮乏力。</p>
<p>當然，導演成功的地方很多，他的細膩，織巧。地位的調度，氣氛的變換，不愧爲是久經戰塲的老手。</p>
<p>演員以演李香君的凌琑如最賣力，成績很優異，我在重慶，昆明先後看過她好幾個戲，要算這次最成功了。特別是幾塲以她爲主的戲，演來從容不迫，更不用那些做作的姿態，處處儘力把內在的心理表露，實屬難能而可貴。高博的侯方域，並沒有把人是人才。文是文才那種氣度演出來，更沒有把這角色卑微的一面顯現。楊文聽這人物是作者的敗筆，人物的性格不完整，他的變化和兩而性稜角太多，然而費克演來使人異常滿意，他替這角色選到了一個合適的形貌。演阮升的那個演員不錯，一付媚上凌下的小人面孔，刻劃得相當深透。</p>
<p>舞台裝置的設計，似乎太草率了，不能有助於劇本要求的效果，甚至在某些部份破壞了戲的散文詩意味。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>幸而沒有多大工夫，擠散在各輛車上的二三十位團員大部份已找來了，經三四個略懂一些醫學皮毛的團員看了看緋緋的病象，大家都說可能也是斑疹傷寒，或許是腦膜炎。</p>
<p>「那末，誰有阿斯匹靈？快請拿出來啊！」老祝萬分焦急地問。</p>
<p>「不，老祝，我有大健鳳！」很快就有一個人答應了。「如果是腦膜炎，大健凰比阿斯匹靈更好」。</p>
<p>老祝也覺得緋緋的病比較近於腦膜炎，因爲她一起病就嚷頭痛。</p>
<p>「好！快！快！」</p>
<p>這個人忙把身上背的那口旅行袋拉下來，急急打袋裏搜摸，居然很快就找到了一個玻璃管，可是取出來一瞧，裏面已祗剩兩片了。</p>
<p>祝兆年毛手毛脚地逼着緋緋先吞服了一片。</p>
<p>「兩片是不够的，老祝。唉！快想別的辦法吧！」站在旁邊瞧了好一會沒有說話的盧前，禁不住又唉聲嘆氣起來。</p>
<p>老祝昂着項，向衆人臉上看了好一會，最後才決定了一個主意。</p>
<p>「諸位，這兩天來的事情你們都是目擊的！」他情感很激動地說：「我現在的她　非常　　，照這孩子的病情來說，我必須馬上帶着她趕路，無論坐車，坐船，坐馬，甚至走路，我得趕快把她弄到南丹去，那兒或許還可能有一所醫院，小孩子的病簡單，早治總不會有問題。可是，我不能不和諸位分手了！你們也許要說我太自私，太不負責任，或者要駡我，恨我，甚至以後不再跟我合作，我也祗能聽憑諸位了……」好幾個人想揷口出來表示他們沒有這種意思。但老說立刻揮揮手，把他們止住了。「我把胡太太母女兩位帶着同走，胡太太自已善　斑疹傷　，留在河池，也不知道那一天可以好，而這孩子偏又病了，我再不照管她，良心上實在說不過去。好在如今我們戲也演不成了，錢也化完了，無非跟着老百姓這　，　嘉有沒有我這一個人，已無多大關係。所以我決定現在就帶着這孩子先走，請文家多多原諒！」</p>

<h3>The Situation in the Northeast Becomes Increasingly Tense; Artillery Battles Erupt in the Suburbs of Siping; National Army on High Alert Along the Jilin-Changchun Line</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 14th] Sun Liren changed his flight to Shenyang on the 14th at noon, and it is rumored that he may stop briefly in Shenyang before flying directly to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] Liao Yaoxiang arrived in Shenyang from Tieling on the evening of the 13th. He told reporters that the defenses of Tieling have been completed according to the original plan, and the Communists have not dared to attack. Liao analyzed the battle situation, saying: The Communists' siege of Siping in recent days may be a feint; they are only using a large number of scattered soldiers to attack. Their true ambition may still be Shenyang. We can assert that they will definitely not be able to cross Tieling to invade.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] For the past two days, the focus of the Northeast war situation has been on Siping, where a large number of Communist troops have gathered and are attacking Siping with all their might. On the other hand, in the Benxi area southeast of Shenyang, the Communist forces there are small, but of great importance. The Communist forces gathered outside Siping are strong, numbering about ten thousand troops, and have been fiercely attacking various strongholds on the outskirts for the past three days. On the 13th, the air force went out, and the fighting subsided slightly, but became intense again at night, with several fires breaking out in the city after being hit by artillery.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] The Battle of Siping has entered a tense stage. On the 14th, the Communist forces launched four fierce attacks with a massive force. The airfield was hit and caught fire. There was fierce fighting within three to five miles of the suburbs of Siping, with the airfield being the most intense.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 14th] The fighting in Siping has been quiet since 9 a.m. yesterday. The Communist 1st and 2nd Security Brigades attacked the airfield fiercely and were repulsed. It is also learned that the Communist forces attacking Siping have built temporary fortifications. The small-scale battles in Siping in recent days can be said to be a prelude to a major battle. It is also learned that the 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions of the Communist 2nd Column are still in the area north and east of Changtu and Kaiyuan, and the rumor that they have reached the outskirts of Siping is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] Siping by telephone: The Battle of Siping began to unfold on the 13th at dusk on the northwest and south sides of the city, becoming even more intense at night, especially in the western suburbs and around the airfield. The Communist forces launched four fierce attacks overnight. On the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist forces also brought in an artillery regiment to assist in the battle, firing more than a thousand shells at the suburbs. The battle was still raging in the afternoon. Also, Siping by telephone reported that General Chen Mingren, who led his troops to defend Siping, telegraphed Commander Du on the morning of the 14th under the four-sided siege of the Communist forces, expressing his determination to defend Siping. The telegram stated: "The Communist forces gathered their main force on the night of the 13th to attack Siping fiercely. From morning to night, the artillery battle did not stop. I have inspired morale and will defend Siping with the spirit of success or death, to live up to your expectations."</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] On the morning of the 13th, the Communist forces invaded Gongyuan and Benxi. The first Communist troops to enter Gongyuan and Benxi were small in number, only a few hundred in each place. A large force arrived on the morning of the 14th, and the National Army is working on a counterattack. Gongyuan and Benxi are both large industrial and mining strongholds on the periphery of Shenyang. The Benxi Railway connects to the Shenyang section of the China-Changchun Railway in the west and the Jiatun Station in the south. The Gongyuan Railway connects to Liaoyang in the west.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] After Gongyuan, a major southeastern stronghold on the periphery of Shenyang, fell, the situation in that area suddenly became tense. The Communist forces are advancing northwest along the railway line. At 9 a.m. on the morning of the 14th, they captured the Huolianzai Station. It is reported that a small number of Communist troops have also been discovered near the Shiqiaozi Station.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] The situation on the periphery of Jilin is becoming tense. Three to four thousand Communist troops captured Chaluhe, 50 kilometers southwest of Jilin, on the highway on the 11th. Another group of Communist troops attacked from the Datun area, 20 to 30 miles northwest of the city.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 14th] A detachment of the Communist Independent Division that captured Chaluhe (west of Jilin) advanced in two routes, and a small number of Communist troops infiltrated Taiping Village, 30 stars south of the Hejiazi along the Jilin-Changchun line. The National Army is on high alert along the Jilin-Changchun line. Also, the transmission line from Xiaoling to Changchun was destroyed by Communist forces at 5 a.m. yesterday, and Changchun was briefly plunged into darkness. Power generation was immediately started using thermal power. It is reported that the destruction occurred at an iron tower 65 kilometers from Changchun.</p>
<h3>The Tianjin-Cangzhou, Beining, and Pinghan Lines Are Constantly Attacked by Communist Forces; Gunfire Heard in Ping City, Tianjin Imposes Curfew Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tianjin, 14th] The main battle on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has not yet begun. The National Army recovered Chenguantun on the evening of the 13th and is now actively deploying to find the main force of the Communist forces. On the afternoon of the 14th, more than 10,000 Communist troops equipped with submachine guns advanced from the northeast of Chenguantun towards Jinghai and have made contact with the National Army. The situation in Tangguantun and Machang is unclear. The South Gate of Cangxian was captured on the evening of the 12th, and the East, West, and North Gates were also captured on the 14th. However, the county seat is still being defended by the garrison. The National Army will dispatch the air force to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tianjin, 14th] The Tianjin Martial Law Headquarters announced temporarily on the 14th that the curfew would be advanced to 10 p.m.</p>
<p>(Above) Deputy Commander Sun Liren, Military Commander Pan Yukun, and others inspect the city defense of Changchun. (Below) A machine gun position somewhere in the suburbs of Changchun. (Photo by Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] Large numbers of National Army reinforcements have arrived in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. According to Xie Yi, Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army of the Tianjin-Cangzhou Pacification Zone, after Nie Rongzhen's Communist forces were defeated in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, they retreated and gradually moved towards the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. In order to support the increasingly unfavorable war situation against the Communist forces in the Northeast, they launched an offensive in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. This situation was expected by the National Army. The purpose of the Communist forces' offensive in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is to cut off the transportation line first, then capture Cangxian, and loot the wheat harvest. After the Communist forces attacked, the garrison has given them a heroic resistance, and large numbers of reinforcements have arrived. In the short term, the Communist forces can be defeated in the Ziya River area. The city of Tianjin and the areas along the Pingjin Railway have increased a large number of defense troops to strictly prevent the Communist forces from harassing them.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 14th] Due to the sudden attacks by the Communist forces on the Pingjin and Pinghan Railways, Sun Lianzhong temporarily suspended his trip to Baoding and stayed in Beiping on the 14th to take emergency measures. He convened a meeting in the afternoon to discuss countermeasures. According to a military observer, the Communist forces' simultaneous attacks on the Beining and Pinghan Railways yesterday were a planned action. Their purpose was to prevent the National Army in Pingjin from reinforcing the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Tianjin, 14th] Two holes in the Longhe Bridge between Luofa and Douzhangzhuang on the Pingjin Railway were blown up by the Communist forces on the evening of the 13th. The piers of both the up and down lines were destroyed, and it will take one or two days to repair them. All trains on the Pingjin line were suspended on the 14th. The three bridges that were previously blown up, namely the 31st, 32nd, and 35th, were repaired on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 14th] On the morning of the 14th, the Pingjin line continued to be sabotaged. More than a thousand Communist troops attacked a steel bridge about 100 meters long near Luoqi at about 1:00 p.m. Most of the bridge was destroyed, and the Railway Bureau is rushing to repair it. It will take three to five days for the Pingjin trains to resume operation. It is also learned that Yongqing, on the south side of the Pingjin line, was besieged by four regiments of Communist forces. The situation was unknown last night, and reinforcements have rushed to reinforce it.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 14th] The Communist forces launched a fierce attack on the data points on the Pingbao section this morning in order to destroy the railway. The Nangangwa Station, 30 kilometers south of Ping City, was besieged by more than 2,000 people at about 3:00 a.m. and was once lost. The stationmaster and 13 others were captured. The sound of gunfire could be heard in Ping City. Fierce fighting was still going on in nearby villages on the afternoon of the 14th. There was also fierce fighting near the Liulihe and Songlindian Stations on the morning of the 14th. The situation in Liulihe is tense. The artillery battle at Beihedian Station was also fierce on the morning of the 14th. The railway between Liulihe and Yongle was destroyed in six places. By noon, three places had been repaired. A repairman was injured by stepping on a mine. The telecommunications along the Pingbao line were destroyed, and all trains were stopped.</p>
<h3>Dong Yanping Will Fly to Nanjing Tomorrow to Report on the Situation in Lushun and Dalian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] Dong Yanping and others of the Lushun-Dalian Inspection Group are scheduled to fly to Nanjing from Shenyang by special plane on the 16th to report to the authorities on the inspection process.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 14th] According to transportation circles, the damaged sections between Yonglebu and Baoding on the Pinghan Railway have been completely repaired. The engineering train heading south from the north has arrived at Nangangwa. If there is no damage on the night of the 14th, it can reach Liulihe on the 15th. According to statistics from the Railway Bureau, a total of eight bridges and fifteen holes, one hundred rails, and one thousand sleepers were destroyed on the Pinghan Railway on the 13th alone.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 14th] Many residents of Beiping were awakened by the sound of gunfire on the morning of the 14th. The Communist forces had occupied Changxindian, six miles southwest of here, for several hours. Shortly after midnight, the sound of artillery fire was heard, which was very clear. Firelight could also be seen in the air until it stopped at 2 a.m. According to a spokesman for the Garrison Headquarters, about 400 Communist troops harassed Changxindian and were repelled by the garrison. There were no damages or casualties reported.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 14th] The Ping-Sui Railway was closed on the 14th. Today, the train from Ping City to Zhangjiakou returned to Beiping after arriving at Nankou Station because the tracks in the Kangzhuang area were destroyed by the Communist forces. The Railway Bureau has sent workers to Kangzhuang to rush to repair them.</p>
<h3>Mobilize the People to Defend the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] In order to mobilize the power of all the people in the Northeast to assist the government in defending the local area, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wang Shuhan, Feng Yong, and others have launched the Northeast People's Clearing and Suppression Committee. The inaugural meeting was held at noon on the 14th. Zhang Zuoxiang was publicly elected as the chairman. Director Xiong attended and delivered a speech, explaining the importance of the Northeast, that without the Northeast, there would be no China, that the treacherous bandits were brutal and would be abandoned by the people of the country, and that strengthening the people's organization could accelerate the collapse of the treacherous bandits.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Shandong Retreat to the Mountains; National Army Completes Deployment, Preparing for Encirclement and Annihilation</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Xuzhou, 14th] The great battle to annihilate the main force of the Communist forces in the Yimeng Mountain area again has begun. About 120,000 people from the 1st, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Communist Columns have been gathering in the southeast, northeast, northwest of Laiwu, and the northeast of Xintai in recent days. In order to strike first, the National Army has launched an offensive against the Communist forces in the northeast of Xintai in recent days. Strategically, the National Army has taken the initiative.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 14th] The new deployment of the National Army in the mountainous areas of southern and central Shandong has been completed, preparing to inflict heavy damage on the Communist forces in the next major battle.

<p>"Beitashan is the same as Changbaishan; Barbarian soldiers suddenly invade Yumen Pass"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Zeng Qi, the leader of the China Youth Party, is still recovering from his illness in the Central Hospital. He recently expressed his feelings on the Mongolian soldiers' invasion of Xinjiang, saying that because the situation is not yet fully clear, it is temporarily inconvenient to judge. He insisted on his belief that a second national crisis will eventually come, and the people of the country must unite to save the nation from extinction, and not think that the country can be safe after the victory of the War of Resistance. The Song Dynasty did not perish at the hands of the Jin Dynasty, but at the hands of the Yuan Dynasty. History is there for our reference. Zeng recently wrote four poems on current events and history, intending to alert his compatriots, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Beitashan is the same as Changbaishan; Barbarian soldiers suddenly invade Yumen Pass. Please ask Zhonghang Yue; Can any Huns return on horseback?</p>
<p>They even become a stepson and call the thief father; There is no shame in this world. In ancient times, there was a traitor Mao Yanshou; That's why he sent Zhao Jun to comfort the barbarians.</p>
<p>Building fortifications to stop the war will ultimately not work; The lobbyists in the Song Dynasty were also in vain. Relying on offense is comparable to relying on defense; A heavenly defense might be completely effective.</p>
<p>The Jin's invasion of the Song Dynasty is laughably foolish; The Yuan's swallowing of China is terrifyingly intelligent. They directly entered the depths of the Southwest; And Zhao's kingdom was completely pacified!</p>
<h3>Premier Zhang’s Economic Plan to Reform Finance, Bringing Floating Capital Back to the Right Track; Will be Submitted for Discussion at the Next Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 14th] An senior official of the Executive Yuan stated that the economic reform plan drafted by Premier Zhang will be submitted for discussion at the next Executive Yuan meeting next week. It is said that this plan was drafted based on the economic plan of the Third Plenary Session, and 95% of the original plan of the senators were retained, with only a few points slightly different. The main points of the plan include: (1) Stabilizing the currency value, (2) Reforming finance, (3) Bringing floating capital back to the right track, (4) Increasing production, (5) Developing agriculture, (6) Establishing people's livelihood industries, etc.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 14th] According to semi-official sources, the Chinese government's confiscation of enemy and puppet properties totaled 94.897 billion yuan by March of this year. The enemy and puppet properties that have not yet been processed are estimated to be approximately 76.257 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Stabilization of Northeastern Currency; Statement by a Financial Figure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] The currency of the Northeast is the most complicated. According to an authoritative financial figure here: (1) The amount of puppet Manchukuo currency issued before the restoration was 8.2 billion yuan, which increased to 13.6 billion yuan before and after the restoration. Some of it was taken away by Japanese prisoners, so the total amount of puppet Manchukuo currency in the Northeast is about 13 billion yuan. Almost all of the puppet Manchukuo currency in the government area has been recovered. (2) The stamped legal tender was a temporary currency used when the National Army entered the pass, amounting to about 830 million yuan, and has long been completely recovered. (3) The central government is issuing circulating notes prudently. A certain newspaper in Tianjin recently reported that "the Northeast is issuing an additional 8 billion circulating notes per month, which is truly alarming." In fact, there is absolutely no such thing. (4) According to estimates, the amount of counterfeit currency issued by the Communist side in the area under its control has reached 52 billion yuan. (5) There are still about 1 billion yen and Korean yen in the Lushun and Dalian areas. The handling method remains to be determined after the takeover. Regarding the finance of the entire Northeast, the authorities are planning to gradually auction off enemy and puppet assets, and the revenue this year may reach 20 billion yuan, which can recover a large amount of circulating notes. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem with the finance of the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Details of the Beitashan Battle; The Dihua Authorities Received a Report from the Front</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 14th] In the Beitashan battle, the local radio station was destroyed by invading aircraft, and communications were disrupted for several days, resulting in an unclear situation. The military authorities here were extremely anxious and sent people overnight to inquire about the situation and send additional troops to reinforce the garrison. However, due to the long distance, it took time to travel back and forth. A detailed report from the front was received this morning, which is recorded as follows: "At noon on the 5th of this month, about one battalion of Outer Mongolian cavalry, equipped with light and heavy weapons, launched a fierce attack on our Beitashan garrison under the cover of five Soviet-marked aircraft (previously mistakenly reported as four aircraft). The area was guarded by a company of the 7th Cavalry Brigade. Company Commander Ma Xizhen immediately led his troops to fiercely resist. The Mongolian army, with three times the strength, pressed against our troops. The aircraft flew low to bomb and strafe. Under their joint land and air attack, our army fought bloodily for four days and nights from the 5th to the 8th. The area was gained and lost several times. Finally, at noon on the 8th, the invading Mongolian army was repelled. The enemy left more than thirty bodies behind, including one officer. We captured one Mongolian small cannon, three light machine guns, more than ten rifles, one radio station, and many documents and maps. In addition, three photos, four banknotes, and two gold medals were found on the body of the officer killed. All of these are powerful evidence of the Mongolian army's invasion of our Xinjiang this time. Our casualties were also heavy. Beitashan is still being firmly defended by our army." After receiving the above report, Song Xilian, Commander-in-Chief of the entire region, praised Company Commander Ma Xizhen of the Beitashan garrison and his troops for fighting bloodily for four days and nights under the joint land and air attack of the Mongolian side and the superior strength of several times our force, and for finally being able to defend the position and preserve the national territory. Their loyalty and bravery were deeply commendable. He immediately sent personnel to comfort and reward the soldiers of the company with 5 million national currency. Currently, reinforcements have arrived at the front one after another, and morale is extremely high. Our army is on high alert and will inflict a major blow on the invaders. The more than 30 corpses finally abandoned by the Mongolian army have been buried by our side, and the various captured documents have been transported to Dihua and will be photographed and made public to the world.</p>

<h3>Postal Official Talks About Postal Reform Plan; Cannot Be Implemented as Scheduled Due to Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 14th] The postal service has improved somewhat in recent months. According to postal officials: At present, some parts of North China and Northeast China are still unable to improve postal services due to damage caused by the Communists. A comprehensive reform has been planned in South China, Northwest China and Southwest China, but due to the current economic difficulties of the postal service and the limited treasury subsidies, the improvement work cannot be implemented as scheduled. The main reason for the economic difficulties of the postal service is that postal rates are too low. Before the war, the postage for each first-class letter was five cents, but now it is 100 yuan, but the commodity price index is only three cents, and the printing cost of stamps is high. The printing cost of each stamp has recently reached 38 yuan. If you send a letter and pay 100 yuan, the printing cost of the stamp has already cost 38 yuan (if you paste two stamps, the cost of the stamp is 76 yuan). If you send a letter at a postal agency, the agency must deduct at least 20 yuan in handling fees, totaling 58 yuan. The remaining 42 yuan is not enough to cover the post office's collection, transportation, and delivery expenses. For example, the fee for sending sporadic newspapers is 10 yuan per bundle, and buying and affixing one stamp costs 38 yuan. In other words, excluding transportation and delivery costs, the stamps alone cost 28 yuan. It is estimated that the post office loses more than 4 billion yuan per month on the transportation of newspapers alone, and other losses are even greater.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of the Hainan Island Province Establishment Issue</h3>
<p>The Hainan Island province establishment issue, which has been brewing for a long time, has been resolved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting: "First, a special administrative region will be established, and a province establishment committee will be organized at the same time to prepare for the establishment of the province. The chairman will be concurrently held by the chief executive." The Ministry of Interior, together with various competent authorities, drafted a plan for the preparation of the establishment of Hainan Island Province, which is generally completed. It is heard that its content will divide the administrative region into three parts: (1) the mainland part, governing 16 counties south of the Gou Lou Mountains; (2) Hainan Island itself, with 16 counties; (3) the four island groups of the East, West, South, and Central Sands. As for the candidate for chief executive, it is probably already internally determined, and will be announced soon. From this point of view, a new and progressive province in the South China region is about to emerge; not only is the whole country paying close attention to this, but the people of Hainan Island, who have been in turmoil for a long time, are especially placing infinite hope on it. Therefore, the establishment of Hainan Island Province is not only a major measure in our domestic affairs, but it also sufficiently illustrates that the government has paid attention to the South China Sea issue.</p>
<p>Hainan Island, also known as Qiongya, is located in the China Sea, that is, in the northwest corner of the South China Sea, between 18 degrees 9 minutes and 21 degrees 11 minutes north latitude, and 108 degrees 36 minutes and 111 degrees 3 minutes east longitude. It is adjacent to the Gulf of Tonkin to the west, close to Vietnam, about 12 nautical miles across the strait to the northwest, and faces the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong Province. It can be reached by civil aviation in half a day. To the slightly north is Beihai, and further away, it looks east to the Philippines and controls the Nanyang Islands to the south. Its transportation line is located between Singapore and Hong Kong, making it a very important island on my southwest international route. The area of ​​its main island is 2,600 square kilometers, which is 268 square kilometers larger than Taiwan, which has an area of ​​2,332 square kilometers. Taiwan is shaped like a sweet potato, and Hainan Island is roughly the same shape. The economic value of the two islands is equal. Strategically, the two islands are like the two eyes of the China Sea. As for the evolution of its political system, as early as 2,000 years ago, when it belonged internally, the Han Dynasty was Dan'er and Zhuya prefectures, the Sui Dynasty added Linzhen county, all belonging to Yangzhou; the Tang Dynasty changed it to five counties, belonging to Lingnan Dao. The Song Dynasty changed it to Qiongzhou, subordinate to Guangnan West Road; the Yuan Dynasty changed the prefecture to belong to Hunan Province. The Ming Dynasty changed the province to a provincial administration commission, divided into three prefectures, and changed it to belong to Guangdong. The Qing Dynasty established Hainan Dao, divided into Qiongya and Yazhou. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the Qing system was followed to establish Qiongya Dao: after the establishment of the National Government, the Dao was abolished and counties were established, dividing the island into 13 counties, and later adding three counties, totaling 16 counties, as the ninth administrative region of Guangdong Province. On February 10, 1939, Japan occupied the island, determined to develop its ports, and plundered its resources, causing the essence of the island to be lost and the people exhausted. After the victory and restoration, Guangdong Province's management was inadequate, the bureaucracy was corrupt, and bandits rose up, plunging the entire island into a tragic situation. In addition, at a time when France invaded the Xisha Islands, Vietnam was in chaos, and Taiwan was uneasy, Hainan, separated from Guangdong by a strip of water, its important position and the precariousness of its situation, if it is not urgently governed, comforting the displaced and slowly developing it, the future is worrying.</p>
<p>The establishment of Hainan Island Province based on the above situation has great significance. This is not only the request of the people of the island, but also the deep expectation of people across the country. However, the establishment of local political systems involves a myriad of details. In the past, such as the establishment of Xikang Province, and the establishment of Suiyuan, Rehe, and Chahar Provinces; in recent times, such as the establishment of the nine northeastern provinces and Taiwan Province, all caused many problems due to incomplete zoning and chaotic political systems. We learn from the past to avoid future mistakes. In principle, we advocate the establishment of Hainan Island Province. In terms of methods and steps, we advocate widely soliciting opinions from the people and experts, following steps and plans, and slowly completing it, not being too hasty. Now, I express a few points regarding the establishment of the province on the island, hoping that the authorities can pay attention to this.</p>
<p>1. The special administrative region system should be carefully considered. The special administrative region system is an unreasonable provincial system; in the past, the establishment of special regions in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe, and the establishment of the administrative chief system in Taiwan a few years ago, were originally expedient measures and made no contribution to local autonomy. The establishment of special regions in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe was due to ethnic issues between Mongolians and Han Chinese and the failure to establish county governments. After the provincial organization law was established, the special regions were abolished. Taiwan adopted the administrative chief system, forming a special system. It was opposed by the people of Taiwan and has recently been abolished and replaced with the provincial system. Hainan Island has had county governments for more than 30 years. Hainan Island is separated from Taiwan by a sea. Taiwan has already experienced the failure of the chief executive system. It does not seem appropriate to repeat it in Hainan. We believe that there are two steps that can be followed for the establishment of Hainan Province: (1) Adopt the transitional province establishment method of the Xikang Province Establishment Committee, and establish the Hainan Province Establishment Committee, directly under the Executive Yuan, to prepare for the establishment of the province: (2) Announce the establishment of the province after establishing the administrative region.</p>
<p>2. The administrative region should be determined. The so-called administrative region refers to the jurisdiction of the province, such as cities, counties, and administrative bureaus. The government attaches great importance to the establishment of Hainan Province and is bound to establish jurisdiction over the islands of the South China Sea, placing the islands under the provincial system, which is a wise measure. However, after checking, the islands in the South China Sea that belong to Chinese sovereignty include the Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha Islands, the Tuan Sha Archipelago, and the Spratly Islands, all of which have strategic value. During the Sino-Japanese War, Dongsha, Xisha, and the Spratly Islands were successively occupied by Japan and placed under the jurisdiction of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After Japan's surrender, our Ministry of Interior placed them under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Province, and the provincial government, together with the naval authorities, took them over, but did not govern them. Now that Hainan Province is established, county governments should be established on the above islands separately. This is not only to determine the administrative region of the province, but also to determine Chinese sovereignty between 8 degrees north latitude and 111 degrees to 115 degrees 5 minutes east longitude.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the name of the province, according to the government's plan, the name of Hainan Island Province will probably be "Hainan Island," and some people advocate "Qiongya Province." We believe that since Hainan Island and the Dongsha and Xisha Islands are located in the South China Sea, and their territorial waters and territory are all Chinese sovereignty, it is appropriate to name it "South China Sea Province." In order to facilitate the operation and management of the islands in the South China Sea in the future, it will be advantageous to establish the provincial capital in Yulin, which is nearly 145 nautical miles from Xisha.</p>
<p>In short, the establishment of Hainan Island Province is a necessary measure. The earlier the establishment of the province is successful, the fewer days foreigners will covet it. The above is what we have discussed, which is the urgent task of establishing the province. We hope that the government will carefully study it and achieve success!</p>

<h3>US Senate Speaker Vandenberg Advocates Setting Up a Bipartisan Advisory Committee to Assist in Handling Foreign Aid Plans, Must Investigate Domestic Resources in Advance to Determine Limits</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 13th] US Republican Senator Vandenberg said tonight that dealing with the overseas reconstruction problem should be based on a "comprehensive and fair basis," and suggested that a bipartisan advisory committee be established in the United States "as a center for coordination and to provide advice to the government and Congress on US foreign aid matters." Vandenberg pointed out that regarding the review of the overseas reconstruction issue, "we may wish to cooperate closely with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and Asia." Vandenberg's statement stated: "The current targets of official and private efforts are the large-scale new US foreign reconstruction plan after the war to prevent the social and economic collapse of many parts of the world. This reconstruction plan is different from the direct relief plan. The public conduct of these discussions is a good thing. But whether at home or abroad, these discussions should not be misunderstood. At home, these discussions should not cause general anxiety, thinking that we will act hastily or make inappropriate plans. Abroad, these discussions should not be taken as a proof that our overseas friendly countries can rely on us instead of relying on themselves. But there is one extremely important question that has not yet been answered. This question involves completing the conditions for stability and peace. These conditions include peace-loving nations that must achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and also include the interests of the United States itself, which can never thrive in a broken world. I advocate that we must deal with this problem in a comprehensive manner and not just scratch the surface. I believe that the United States must deal with the situation with great courage for its own interests. We must conduct a comprehensive survey of our own resources to determine the limits of our consideration of foreign aid. This is a critical issue, because if the United States relaxes, the hopes of the world will also be relaxed."</p>
<p>[US News Agency, New York, 13th] Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp gave a speech here on Thursday, reviewing the needs of foreign countries and the methods by which they obtain foreign aid (especially from the United States). It is said that the disconnect between the two has made the problem increasingly difficult. He analyzed that if the slow economic recovery of certain regions is to be resolved, it is necessary to continue to provide a large amount of aid from the United States, and at the same time, the policies and plans of these countries should be re-examined. Thorp told the meeting of the American Business Council that, to date, "the amount of foreign loans and aid allocated by the United States has reached 13 billion US dollars. Of this amount, about 9 billion US dollars has been spent." He continued: "This expenditure does not include US donations to international institutions. But when paying, it is actually not money, 'most of it is materials and services provided by the United States to support the economies of other countries.'"</p>

<h3>Blunt Warning from Brown: Directed at Some Korean Leaders, Seemingly at Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 14th] At a banquet hosted by the mayor of Seoul for the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission last night, U.S. Major General Brown stated: Any Korean leader who refuses to represent the people and accept the consultation of the commission will be deprived of their rights. Observers unanimously believe that Brown's words were directed at Kim Koo, as Syngman Rhee had previously declared that Chiang Kai-shek urged others to accept the consultation of the Joint Commission. However, both Rhee and Kim themselves still refuse to consult before the U.S. and the Soviet Union clarify the definitions of democratic rights and trusteeship. Brown bluntly warned a few Korean leaders hesitant to fully support the work of the Joint Commission. They are indeed deluded by illusory dangers, deeply fearing "deceitful schemes" between the lines of the Moscow Agreement. If they could conduct a detailed and impartial study of the Moscow Agreement, such concerns would naturally disappear. At this critical juncture, illusory errors should not be allowed to wreak havoc, squandering the golden opportunity for a unified temporary Korean government that the people unanimously desire. According to the mayor, Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee were invited to last night's banquet, but neither of them attended in the end.</p>
<h3>Italian Parliament Confirms Confidence in Government; French National Assembly Approves Treaty with Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 13th] The right-wing Gasperi Cabinet of Italy overwhelmingly passed a vote of confidence in Parliament on the 13th, defeating the Communist Party and the Left by a margin of 73 votes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] The French National Assembly today approved the treaty with Italy by a vote of 510. Dissenters numbered about 890, mostly Radicals and far-right elements. Before the vote, Foreign Minister Bidault made an appeal, stating that, according to the treaty with Italy, the transfer of the Tenda and Briga regions on the Italian-French border from Italy to France would still require a vote by the local residents for final determination. Bidault further clarified that France and Italy signed a continental pact with no thought of retribution. Although France once resisted the tyrannical government of Italy, it harbors no hatred towards the Italian people. France deeply admires the wartime underground resistance fighters of Italy and believes that once the treaty is ratified, the traditional relations between the two countries will be restored, and they will move forward along the path of former partners.</p>

<h3>Over a Thousand Students Riot in Court, Shouting and Occupying Judges' Seats; Court Approves Attempted Reconciliation in Shanghai Law College Fracas</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The trial of the Shanghai Law College student brawl case at the District Court yesterday afternoon caused a great disturbance. Over a thousand students from various schools gathered in the courtroom from 1 p.m., singing and shouting, causing great disorder, making it impossible to hear the case. As a result, a notice was posted postponing the trial. Students from Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Great China University, Datong University, Guanghua University, St. John's University, Soochow University, Shanghai Law College, Nantong, China Vocational, Shanghai Art College, Shanghai Municipal Drama School, National Kindergarten Teachers College, Minzhi Vocational, Nanyang Girls' Middle School, Tongji High School, Huxi Middle School, Pingmin Girls' Middle School, Chu Neng Middle School, Obstetrics, and Wen De Midwifery and other schools were present, shouting "Open the court!" and "Judges must obey the law!" Their emotions were extremely agitated, and they sang the song "You Bad Thing." A portion of the students occupied the judge's seat, and a banner of Jiaotong University and the arrested students was hung in front of the legal case. At this time, the court, finding it difficult to maintain order, and with the plaintiffs, defendants, and Shanghai Law College all requesting a postponement of the trial, posted a notice deciding to postpone the opening of the court. The notice stated: "In the case of Tian Jiyi et al. accused of assault, the plaintiffs and the defendant school authorities requested a postponement to conduct reconciliation. With the consent of the prosecutor, it should be approved." Upon seeing the notice, the students became even more rowdy. Subsequently, Su Shuyuan, one of the defendants released on bail, requested to see Dean Cha, presenting two points: (1) Release the detained defendants in court, (2) Deny reconciliation. Dean Cha immediately told her, "The matter of bail is the responsibility of the judge handling the case, and I have no authority to intervene. Reconciliation is a request from the Shanghai Legal authorities."</p>

<h3>All Students Demand Two Points</h3>
<p>The student body made two demands: (1) The court should explain the reason for the postponement, (2) Confirm the rescheduled date.

(2) If reconciliation fails, a public trial will be held within a week. The students refused to withdraw because the date of the public trial had not been set, resulting in a stalemate until around 7 p.m., when Chu Fengyi, the acting president of Shanghai Law College, arrived and tried to persuade the students to return to school, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Families Request Release of Detained Students</h3>
<p>At the same time, the families of the detained students also sent representatives Xia Wei's father, Xia Zhengming, Qu Yuan's father, Qu Naisheng, and Tang Kefei's mother and uncle, Tang Jinbiao, to request a meeting with Dean Cha, who was received by Huang Guang, the chief clerk.

Subsequently, Chief Clerk Huang replied: (1) The date of the public trial will be announced two days before. (2) During the legal proceedings, the defendants will not be transferred to any agency. (3) As for bail, it is within the judge's authority, and there is no authority to answer. The students, feeling satisfied, dispersed, by which time it was 8:05 p.m. Chu, the acting president of Shanghai Law College, Yang Jingzhen, the director of general affairs of the college, sixteen student representatives, and family members remained in the reception room to discuss reconciliation methods, dispersing at 9:10 p.m.</p>

<h3>Three Representatives Visit Director Wu, Presenting Difficulties of Business and Industry; Wu Explains Restoration of Base Salary Impossible; Salary Based on Last Month's Index Will Be Considered</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Xu Jiqing, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jin Runzhao, a director, and Wu Yunshi, the chairman of the Industrial Association, visited Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, at 11 a.m. yesterday to present the current difficulties of business and industry and put forward four requests: (1) Restore wages to the base salary of 1936. (2) Economic fluctuations are uncertain, and it is difficult for business and industry products to calculate costs. The monthly wages of all manufacturers should be based on the index of the previous month. (3) All closures and layoffs should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law and should be given advance notice. (4) Stop illegal actions of arbitrary strikes and slowdowns.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Wages Do Not Meet Standards</h3>
<p>Director Wu gave a reply one by one, saying: (1) During the rule of the concessions at that time, the wages of workers were low, and their lives were mostly substandard. Now the Social Affairs Bureau has no reason to make workers return to such a life. It is true that some workers have been given too much, but this cannot be generalized, so it is impossible to immediately require a uniform return to the base salary of 1936. (2) The proposed request can be considered. The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee will convene a meeting next week, and the Industrial Association has already submitted a proposal, which will be discussed and decided by the Evaluation Committee.</p>
<h3>Layoff Methods Can Be Considered</h3>
<p>(3) According to the layoff method for workers during the Shanghai Reinstatement Period, the severance pay was issued for a minimum of three months and a maximum of one year, two years, or even longer. Later, the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee revised it to a minimum of half a month and a maximum of three months. This move was to protect factories and was also a painstaking effort. The business and industry community did not object to the unreasonable method at the time, but now they are dissatisfied with the revised and improved method, which is not reasonable. The current layoff method has no basis in the Factory Law, which I also admit, so legally speaking, this point can be considered. (4) The matter of stopping illegal actions by workers was previously submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion, and the mayor and the police bureau agreed. The Social Affairs Bureau and the police bureau have jointly issued a notice to stop such actions, and it is believed that such situations will be reduced in the future.</p>
<p>During the talks, they were very agreeable to each other. Xu, Jin, and Wu agreed to convey Director Wu's opinions to the members.</p>
<h3>Spring House Tax Rate Reduced</h3>
<p>The spring house tax and municipal construction tax will be levied starting today. The house tax rate is lower than in winter. Business houses will be levied 10% of the rent, and residential houses will be levied 5% of the rent. The municipal construction tax will still be levied at the same rate as in the winter of last year.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Suspension of Business and Strikes Will Be Strictly Investigated and Handled; Police and Social Affairs Bureaus Jointly Issued a Notice Yesterday</h3>

Because some workers have taken excessive actions, the employers have requested the authorities to rectify labor discipline. This matter was discussed at the Municipal Council a few days ago, and it was decided that the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus should jointly issue a notice immediately to strictly prohibit factory closures, business suspensions, strikes, and slowdowns in order to maintain social order. After this notice, if there are any more actions such as unauthorized factory closures, business suspensions, strikes, slowdowns, gathering crowds to coerce, encircle, or threaten, they will be strictly investigated and handled in accordance with the temporary measures for maintaining social order.</p>
<h3>Local Association Reorganizes Association Affairs; Held General Membership Meeting Yesterday; Promoting Prosperity and Seeking Welfare for Citizens; Will Assist the Government in the Spirit of the Past</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Local Association held a general membership meeting at the Pudong Native Place Association on Zhongzheng East Road at 4 p.m. yesterday, attended by President Du Yuesheng, Vice Presidents Wang Xiaoying and Qian Xinzhi, and members Pan Gongzhan, Huang Yanpei, Lu Jingshi, Wu Kaixian, Xu Jiqing, Luo Qinghua, Zhang Shizhao, and others, more than two hundred people. The meeting discussed the articles of association, elected directors, supervisors, and secretaries, and passed a declaration. The meeting adjourned at around 6 p.m.</p>
<p>After performing the etiquette, President Du first gave a speech, hoping that the members of the association would assist the government in the spirit of the past and strive for the stability and revival of the city. Then, Xu Jiqing, a member, reported on the association's affairs, saying: The predecessor of the Shanghai Municipal Local Association was the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, which was initiated and organized by leaders from all walks of life in the city during the January 28th Incident. In response to the needs of the time, it supplemented the government's deficiencies in local order, market finance, and the supply of front-line military needs. After the signing of the Shanghai-Songhu Truce Agreement, the people knew that the enemy's ambition was still in its infancy. In order to encourage them to strive and concentrate their efforts for the future and prepare for the unexpected, it was reorganized into the Shanghai Municipal Local Association. Therefore, in terms of evolution, this association began with the War of Resistance Against Japan; in terms of meaning, the work of this association was not to strive to be the forerunner of mobilizing the people. From 1932 to the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan was the first period. On the one hand, the work of the association was devoted to social undertakings, such as the education of children, with the Zhabei Civilian Education Institute and the Minhang Guangci Orphanage, and the improvement of rural areas, with the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Committee. On the other hand, the statistics on Shanghai's food and other items were compiled annually by the Shanghai Municipal Statistical Committee. And with regard to local reforms, it cooperated with public organizations to promote them at any time. At that time, in order to prepare for the incident, the central government implemented civil training. This association took the lead in advocating and, in response to the situation, quietly observed the evolution, invited interested people to give lectures and discuss, and improve the level of awareness. After the War of Resistance Against Japan began, this association almost became a rear support center, providing relief and rescue. This association almost became a rear support center, condolences and donations were divided into departments, each responsible for their own duties. In addition, it used its remaining strength to assist the northern and southern battlefields, relieve unemployed workers, and encourage factories to relocate internally in a timely manner to maintain production. When the national army withdrew, the society was in the hands of demons in the north and south cities. The society leaders were forced to leave Shanghai one after another, and the handling of association affairs was handed over to Xu Ciacheng. In the midst of difficulties, it continued to work tirelessly. During this period, such as the solicitation of various public debts, the protection of staff, the urgent raising of funds, the assistance of travelers from Sichuan, the maintenance of the lives of those who stayed behind, and the communication and liaison with Hong Kong and Chongqing were maintained, even after the outbreak of the Pacific War, until the enemy surrendered, it was twisted and turned, and it was never interrupted. The name of the local association has always been clean and has never been used by the enemy puppets. The Commander-in-Chief Chiang's surrender instruction to the enemy was transmitted by the secret radio station connected by the local association. When the victory was approaching, the association began to recover. Due to the long-term separation of members, it was urgent to re-investigate and reorganize the association's affairs. A preparatory meeting for the reinstatement was held on February 15 last year. After the meeting, old members were re-registered and new members were absorbed. To date, there are more than 500 new and old members.</p>
<p>After the report, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Yanpei, and others successively made speeches, praising the work led by the society leader and hoping that the local association would continue to work hard to revive Shanghai.</p>
<p>Then, the articles of association were discussed and passed, saying, "The purpose of the local association is to assist in social construction, promote local prosperity, and seek welfare for citizens." Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Wang Xiaolai, Shui Xiangyun, and other thirty-three people were elected as directors, Wei Rushan, Yang Yinpu, and other eleven people were elected as alternate directors, Li Shizeng, Yu Guitang, Wang Yansong, and other eleven people were elected as supervisors, Zhu Huiqing and other three people were elected as alternate supervisors, and Zhang Shizhao was the secretary-general, responsible for practical work. Finally, a declaration was passed.</p>
<h3>Theater Teahouse Boss Died Tragically on the Way Home</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhu Qingfu, a native of Yangzhou, 56 years old, has been the teahouse boss at the Chucheng Grand Theater on Zhoujiapai Road, Hudong. At around 11:30 p.m. the night before last, after the theater closed, he was returning home. When he passed the open space in Shuncheng Lane on the same road, a gang of thugs lying in wait suddenly came forward and hacked the back of his head twice with axes.

<h3>Amidst Central Government's Financial Difficulties: National Education Conference Canceled; National Games and National Art Exhibition Also Canceled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] During the current session of the National Political Council, some opposed the Ministry of Education's plan to convene a National Education Conference this autumn. Their reasoning was that 90% of the proposals resolved at past National Education Conferences had not been implemented. At a time when the central government's finances are strained and schools are severely lacking in equipment, it would be better to transfer the billions of yuan budgeted for the National Education Conference to emergency equipment funding for schools. Recently, the Executive Yuan also rejected the National Art Exhibition due to budgetary constraints, and rejected requests for subsidies for the National Games. Both events will not be held. Furthermore, UNESCO planned to convene a Far East regional basic education conference in the capital this September. The Ministry of Education had requested 3.9 billion yuan from the Executive Yuan to cover all conference expenses and to subsidize the upgrading of equipment at excellent schools in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou for foreign visitors to see. The Executive Yuan also significantly reduced the allocation due to limited funds. Sources indicate that this year's National Education Conference will also be canceled.</p>

<h3>Credit Eases, Sentiment Improves, Stock Market Enters Better Territory: Yonglu, Xinya, Xinyi, and Others Hit Limit Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the Shanghai stock market was cheerful, credit was readily available, the Hong Kong exchange rate rose again, and major players entered the market to go long, ultimately leading to a price increase. The market showed signs of a turnaround, and there were many speculations of positive factors. Yongsha hit the limit up and then continued to rise. Xinya, Shangwu, Cement, Maya, Yonggong, and Xinyi all approached the limit up. Huafeng, which had been dormant for a long time, also showed its strength again, reaching the limit up at the close. Observing the environment, people in the industry are in high spirits, but outside speculative funds have not yet been very active, and the future still needs to be consolidated.</p>
<p>The market opened higher in the morning due to the easing of credit. Yongsha was delivered after opening, and advanced from 6,199 to 6,146, 6,163, 6,146, 6,223, 6,174, and 6,224 yuan. The 97th, 61st, and 50th brokers closed out at a high, retreating to 6,300 yuan. The 23rd, 154th, 235th, 223rd, 232nd, 163rd, 142nd, 76th, 61st, 24th, 173rd, 73rd, 152nd, 224th, and 155th brokers supplied in, and the 231st broker even handed over cash for Yongsha. Xinya was the first to hit the limit up at the 2nd broker, and then Yongsha rose to 6,660 yuan. Now Yongsha was also pushed high by the 151st and 157th brokers to the limit up. The 98th and 89th brokers sold now Yongsha vigorously, and the 102nd, 85th, 65th, 215th, 47th, 31st, 19th, and 201st brokers also sold off. At 10:20 AM, it fell back to 6,500 yuan.

At 11:40 AM, the 231st, 155th, 11th, 152nd, and 224th brokers came in, and Shangwu Cement also hit the limit up. Yongsha was then announced to have hit the limit up. Before long, now Yongsha was needed by someone at 50 yuan higher, and Maya was immediately suspended from the 27th broker, and Yonggong handed over and the current Huafeng Xinyi both approached the suspension. In the dark market, the 94th, 152nd, and 154th brokers were even competing to buy, reaching over 6,850 yuan after the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha Maya Xinyi hit the limit up, Huafeng rose slightly after hitting the limit up, rising by slightly less than 20%. Xinguang Yonggong Jingfu each rose by half a percent, Qinxing Zhongfa Xinhua rose by one percent, Shangwu Cement Xinya hit the limit up, Rongfeng Match Lian each rose by half a percent, and Zhongfang Tongyi Datong Zhongsili Jinglun underwear each rose by one percent and a fraction, and Wuhe only rose slightly. Deliveries of Yongsha Yonggong hit the limit up? Xinyi Maya Huafeng Xinguang each rose by slightly less than one percent, reaching up to half. Jingfu Qinxing each rose by more than half a percent. Among the old stocks outside the market, except for Zhabei Wuzhou, which remained flat, the rest rebounded.</p>
<h3>National Bank Agrees to Bear Losses for Sale of Yarn and Cloth in Nanyang Markets: Types of Cotton Textiles Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Due to rampant smuggling and a sharp drop in overseas market prices, while domestic costs cannot be suppressed due to the lifting of the cost of living index, the legitimate export of yarn, cloth, and cotton products to Nanyang markets has been severely impacted. The Fangjian Corporation and the China National Goods Joint Operating Company have been striving for overseas sales markets and have repeatedly exported, but have suffered losses. They have prepared a detailed plan, requesting subsidies from the National Bank. It is now known that the Central Bank has agreed to provide support. Regarding yarn and cloth, the National Bank and the Fangjian Corporation have agreed on the principle that the National Bank will purchase 10% of Fangjian's total monthly output at domestic market prices and entrust Fangjian to sell it in Nanyang on its behalf. The National Bank will compensate for the losses, and the foreign exchange obtained will also be purchased by the National Bank. Reporters inquired with the Fangjian Corporation, and it was stated that although the principle of selling to Nanyang has been decided by the National Bank, the quantity to be sold is still under consideration. This quantity is based on 10% of the output of Fangjian companies in various regions to be shipped to Nanyang, so the quantity is considerable. To facilitate transportation, products from the Shanghai and Qingdao Fangjian factories may be allocated for transportation. Also, there are many types of cotton textiles, and the Joint Operating Company and the National Bank are still in negotiations. The principle is the same as for yarn and cloth, and they will be exported on their behalf, possibly handled by the National Goods Joint Operating Company. The sales locations will initially target British Malaya, Siam, Hong Kong, and Singapore.</p>
<h3>Unified Price Stable, Foreign Shares Firm</h3>
<p>Government bonds were very stable yesterday. Unified C opened at 6,600 yuan. The 360th, 551st, 552nd, and 280th brokers sold, and the 504th broker bought over 4 million yuan, and then the market closed up at 7,600 yuan. Compared with the previous close, A, B, C, and E all remained stable, only Unified D rose slightly by 100 yuan, with a turnover of over 6 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign shares rebounded due to the resurgence of the stock market, and the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric reduced to 14.6 yuan, and the shape was firm. English Alliance, with the help of the Guangbang Force, sought to increase more. Yisha opened in the morning at 65,000 yuan, the Jinhaobang gave a slight supply, falling to 63,500 yuan, the banking group, the securities group, and foreign merchants all increased, rising to 67,000 yuan closing price.

<h3>Modification of Import License Application Methods in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] The Hong Kong government has modified the application methods for import licenses. Starting from the 16th, goods imported from the British Empire and its autonomous territories (except Canada and Newfoundland), France, Egypt, the Netherlands, and its territories, Palestine, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Iraq, and Siam, except for butter, vegetable oil, cheese, canned fish, flour, rice and rice products, sugar, meat, soap, tin, hemp, coal, cotton yarn, and sulfuric acid, do not require a special license, only a general license. Goods shipped from Macau, China, except for coal, coking coal, and cotton yarn, do not require a license. However, US-made products shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong require a license.</p>
<h3>Steel Supply Situation in This City</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the current steel supply situation in this city is as follows: (1) Pig Iron. Last year, there was a shortage of iron, and prices soared. After the Guidance Office purchased it from various parties, the first batch of pig iron from the Junqing D渡口 Steel Factory arrived in Shanghai, and the market price stabilized immediately. Subsequently, pig iron from Anshan, North China, and Taiwan was shipped to Shanghai one after another, and the problem of iron shortage was resolved. The supply of pig iron will be smooth in the future, so there will be no shortage of pig iron in Shanghai. (2) Wire Rod. Wire rod is a necessary material for manufacturing various needles, iron wires, lead wires, stranded ropes, etc. In the past, there was also a shortage. Most steel rolling mills used scrap iron plates instead to meet the urgent needs of the market, but because the composition was not suitable and the length was insufficient, the quality of the finished product was difficult to meet the standards. However, recently, 1,000 tons of round steel ordered by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Rolling Mill from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been shipped to Shanghai one after another and will soon start construction. In addition, the company's open-hearth steel will also be smelted, which can be used for self-pouring steel coins for rolling steel, so the problem of wire rod supply can be solved. (3) Various light-pound square steel and ribbed steel materials for construction and machinery. The local steel rolling mills in this city can only produce a part of the needs, and most of them still rely on imports from other ports. For example, Anshan in Northeast China can produce a large quantity. In the past two or three months, there have been quite a few foreign goods imported, and most of them are orders from last year. This kind of material can be manufactured domestically, so the import of foreign goods should be prohibited. (4) Iron Sheet. Black iron sheet and tinplate are still in short supply on the market to date. Before the domestic steel mills have products, the import of foreign goods cannot be avoided. Fortunately, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is preparing to roll iron sheets of numbers 16 to 26 in the near future and ship them to Shanghai for supply.</p>
<p>Fangjian Cloth Sales</p>
<p>[Our Report] China Fangjian Corporation sold cloth yesterday as usual, with a total of 10,390 pieces sold and 260 quilts sold. Fourteen manufacturers applied to purchase, for a total of 56 pieces, and 334 cloth shops applied for a total of 9,830 pieces and 260 quilts.</p>
<h3>Exchange Settlement Period for Exported Consignment Goods Extended to 30 Days</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 102 yesterday to various designated banks regarding the handling of foreign exchange settlement for exported consignment goods before February 17, 1947, stating that the deadline for the delivery of foreign exchange for exported consignment goods before February 17 of this year, as stipulated in the Bank's Circular No. 91, has expired. In order to facilitate the promotion and sale of consignment goods by exporters, the deadline for the delivery of foreign exchange is extended again from May 25 of this year for a period of 30 days, and no further extension will be granted after the deadline. It is hoped that customers will be notified to strictly abide by this. Otherwise, the exchange rate for the delivery of foreign exchange after the goods are sold out will still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's Circular No. 86. This circular is hereby issued for your reference and compliance.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Not Brisk Early On, Export Trade Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market transactions in foreign firms were still extremely weak. Several Chinese export companies are currently rushing to pack various grades purchased a few days ago. In addition, the continuous rain dampened enthusiasm for activity. The trend is that those holding goods remain steadfast, and the market continues to fluctuate. Various domestic teas are selling reasonably well in local shops and among merchants from other areas, and prices are quite stable. According to people in the trade, low-end black tea has recently regained favor in Suzhou and other places, and prices are not too demanding, so considerable transactions may occur in the coming days. It is also learned that the demand from Tianjin merchants for non-war silk and tea buds continues to be uncertain due to stalled negotiations, and the process is temporarily unclear.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics See High Prices Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the woolen fabric market, except for summer goods remaining unchanged, autumn and winter goods saw repeated high prices. Merchants from Qiyi Street mostly refused to sell, and the trend at the tea houses was consistently firm and bullish. Based on the principle of exchanging one bolt of woolen fabric for one dan of white rice, all firms expect to see the yarn market improve. However, due to the lack of a continuous supply, insufficient inventory, and declining production, factory prices are higher than spot prices. Rumors of profitable purchases pervade the market.</p>
<h3>National Bank Discount Committee Approves 3 Billion Yuan in Industrial Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank Discount Committee held its eleventh meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. A total of nineteen committee members, including Zhu Tongjiu, attended. Twenty-one loan applications were approved, totaling approximately 3 billion yuan. Furthermore, the committee had previously organized a subcommittee to discuss the standards for lenient and strict reviews of industrial loans. After two meetings, the subcommittee drafted four articles of the "Central Bank Discount Committee Procedures for Reviewing Industrial Loan Cases." This draft was also revised and approved by yesterday's review committee and sent to the Discount Committee for approval.</p>
<h3>Public Reserve Funds Cannot Be Included in Capital</h3>
<p>Reserves Still Subject to Taxation</p>
<p>The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce recently received a telegram from the Direct Taxation Bureau stating that the revised Income Tax Law and its implementing regulations do not clearly specify whether one-third of the public reserve fund of Category I profit-seeking enterprises should be included in the calculation of capital as a precedent, or whether the year-end reserve fund should be included in the calculation of net profit for taxation. Now, a telegram from the Direct Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance indicates that the public reserve fund cannot have one-third included in the calculation of capital and that the public reserve fund to be set aside in the current year cannot be deducted from the net profit for taxation when calculating the income amount. The Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the above instructions to all businesses for compliance.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Export Silk Suffers a Projected Loss of 7 Billion</h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Silk Weaving Guidance Association, labor costs have nearly doubled since the de-freezing of the cost of living index. The budget for the first phase of export silk fabrics has been insufficient after adding the increased labor costs in May and June. The association has already compiled the budget table for the first phase of profit and loss and submitted it to the authorities for review. (1) A total of 86,550 bolts have been woven, with 57,048 bolts finished and 29,502 bolts unfinished. (2) 186,602 pounds of raw silk are required (equivalent to 1,400 dan), totaling 156,745,800.00 yuan in legal tender. (3) 460,067 pounds of rayon are required (2,300 cases), totaling 271,440,000.00 yuan in legal tender. (4) The total cost is 54,504,180,000.00 yuan. (5) The total selling price is 47,634,370,000.00 yuan. The difference results in a loss of 6,869,810,000.00 yuan. The above budget is based on the rupee price converted from the selling price per yard in India (the rupee price is 3,400 yuan).</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) Export silk fabrics are being gradually developed for India, Singapore, and Southeast Asia. The future of the first phase of finished products would have been very promising if labor costs had not increased so sharply. Now, they are in a difficult environment. However, the Guidance Association is preparing a plan for the continued weaving of the second phase and submitting it to the authorities for review. As for the request for 20 billion yuan in payment for goods, it is said that the authorities are reviewing it and a decision should be made within days.</p>

<h3>The Northeast Corner of the Inferno—The Communist Army is Mobilizing, Eager to Succeed—The War Situation Will See New Developments in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>— Changchun, 4th [of the month], Air Dispatch. Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>The summer offensive launched by the Communist army in the Northeast has rapidly expanded from the Songhua River basin to the Liao River basin, sweeping across the fertile areas of the Songyuan Plain like an adverse storm. After a period of intense destruction, the Northeast seems to have suffered severe paralysis. From this perspective, the economic and political significance of the Communist army's offensive is far more important than the military significance.</p>
<p>Historically, the northeastern border has often been a breeding ground for unrest, and this remains true today. The creation of the Communist army's power in the Northeast depends on the superior agricultural economic conditions. The alluvial plains formed along the Heilongjiang River, Ussuri River, and Songhua River in the northern part are fertile and rich in agricultural products, known as the "granary." The source of able-bodied men and military rations is thus worry-free. Extending its wings from Harbin, west to Fuyu and east to Yanji, it forms a crescent shape, eyeing the gateway to the Changji area. Harbin is the former command post of the Chinese Communist Party in the Northeast, issuing orders from here, resembling the "red capital" of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Benefits of Geography</p>
<p>Due to the benefits of geography, the Northeast Communist army can obtain foreign aid. In previous battles, a small number of Korean Communist troops and Mongolian cavalry were discovered, and in the recent offensive, their numbers have surged, estimated to total around 100,000. At the same time, Soviet-style weapons were found in the war spoils captured by the National Army.</p>
<p>From this offensive, it can be seen that the Northeast Communist army is using a long-term war of attrition as a military struggle to overthrow the government, using space to buy time. At the same time, it is launching an economic struggle, conducting war to support war. The Communist army invades the recovered areas, seizing food and kidnapping able-bodied men, implementing their "scorched earth" policy.</p>
<p>The Northeast Communist army claims to occupy Changchun, meet in Luoyang, and admire the moon at Shanhaiguan during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. Just look at how boastful they are!</p>
<p>Three Ambitions for Southern Invasion</p>
<p>Military strategists predict that the Communist army's attempt to invade the South this time has three purposes: (1) From Harbin and Dalian, attack north and south along the Chinese Eastern Railway, meeting in Shenyang. The main purpose is to contain the National Army's takeover of Dalian. (2) Open up a corridor from Outer Mongolia to North Korea, control three-quarters of the Northeast's area, and prevent the National Army from taking over Harbin. (3) Use a comprehensive mobile warfare to strike the National Army's field army while conducting widespread raids and destruction, plunging society into chaos and turning the Northeast into the second Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The National Army is also keenly aware of its scheme and is actively deploying, and a major battle will begin soon. The end of this battle will be in two months at the shortest or two months at the longest. And the restoration of traffic will take at least half a year.</p>
<p>Around mid-April, when news of Lin Biao's death was rampant, the Communist army north of the Songhua River gathered in the area along the Songhua River in Harbin. Around Yushu, Shuangcheng, and Wukeshu, a crowd of 100,000 was assembled. The unit designations are the First Column, First, Second, and Third Divisions; the Second Column, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Divisions; the Independent First Division; the Independent Second Division; the Mongolian Cavalry Brigade; and a portion of the security forces. The action to invade southward on a large scale had already been decided.</p>
<p>In early May, the Communist army crossed the river from Fuyu. On the 12th, the Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the Communist army approached the outskirts of Nong'an. The Battle of Huanglong began. However, the Communist army approached the northern suburbs and contacted the defending troops. Knowing the strength of the defending army, it feigned an attack with a portion of its forces, while the main force attacked Huai'de southeast of Changchun via the western territory of Changchun County. The attack on the city began on the 14th. The three divisions of the Communist army's First Column and the Independent First Division took turns attacking using a wheel warfare tactic. One regiment of the 30th Division of the defending army fought bitterly, sacrificing more than half of its soldiers. They broke through the northern side of Changxiao on the 18th, and Guo Changxiang Dianyuan died for the country. The Second Column encountered the 88th Division of the 71st Army, which had advanced from Siping to disturb Huai'de, in the Daheilizi area. The National Army launched a hasty attack, using fewer forces to control a larger number of troops, and suffered losses due to the unfavorable terrain. The Communist army then occupied Gongzhuling, an important town on the Chinese Eastern Railway, in the afternoon of the 19th, cutting off traffic between Changchun and Panjin. A portion of its forces came north to contain Changchun, and the majority of its forces moved south.</p>
<p>The Communist Army on the Pingmei Line</p>
<p>After the Communist army captured Huai'de and Gongzhuling, the National Army that had attacked from Siping retreated to the south bank of the Dongliao River to defend the outskirts of Siping. The First and Second Columns of the Communist army crossed the Dongliao River from Yitong County and advanced towards Siping. The Independent Second Division captured Bianyang County northeast of Yitong on the 22nd and then raided along the Jihai line. The Independent First Division and its affiliated units were entrenched between Huai'de, Gongzhuling, Liling, and Changchun. The Battle of Siping began on the 22nd. Outlying strongholds of Siping, such as Guojia Dian, Shilibu, Hafu, Bamiancheng, and Old Siping, were successively captured by the Communist army, but Siping ultimately had no chance to be exploited. Until the afternoon of the 25th, the Communist army retreated from the entire line outside Siping, detouring south of Siping. The Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the First Column invaded the vicinity of Changtu via the west side of Siping. The First and Third Divisions of the First Column raided the southeast of Siping, threatening Kaiyuan. Two divisions of troops were still stationed outside Siping. Just as the war in Siping eased, the situation on the Pingmei Line became tense again.</p>
<p>The Communist army on the Pingmei Line gathered 80,000 troops. The unit designations are the Third Column, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Divisions; the Fourth Column, Tenth and Eleventh Divisions; the Independent Second Division from north of the Songhua River; the Korean Independent Division; the Li Hongxian Branch of the Korean Communist Party; and the First Security Brigade. Starting on the 23rd, they besieged Meihekou, attacking fiercely day and night. On the night of the 29th, Meihekou was finally captured. Chen Kaiwen's troops of the 184th Division of the defending army fought bravely, fulfilling the highest strategic task. After the Communist army occupied Meihekou, it divided its forces into two routes: one route went south to jointly attack Changtu, and the other route went north, seemingly intending to invade Jilin.</p>
<p>Three Routes to Attack Jilin</p>
<p>When the outskirts of Changchun were tense, the Communist army in eastern Jilin also began to stir. Cao Lihuai, the leader of the Communist army in the Jilin Military Region, decided on a plan to attack Jilin in three routes. One route attacked Jilin from the area north of Jiangmifeng. One route crossed the river near Baiqitun, attacked Wulajie, went south to Tumenling, and detoured to Jilin. One route crossed the river from Jiaohe via Xindian (southeast of Jilin) and attacked Xiaofengman. The Communist army's strength on the outskirts of Jilin was about 80,000 troops, including the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Divisions of the Sixth Column, the Independent Third Division, the Second Security Brigade, and the 24th and 25th Brigades.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 14, a portion of the Communist army attacking Jilin from Jiangmifeng raided Xinjilin, 10 miles north of Jilin, confronting the National Army across the river. Clear gunshots and artillery fire could be heard from Jilin. In the afternoon of the 14th, the National Army crossed the river and counterattacked, driving the Communist army back to Datun, north of Jilin. The Communist army that crossed the river from Baiqitun occupied Wulajie on the morning of the 20th, but was stopped by the National Army south of Wulajie and has not succeeded so far. More than 10,000 Communist troops carrying heavy weapons attacked Xiaofengman starting on the 19th. The war on the east bank of the Second Songhua River was extremely fierce for days. The Communist army tried repeatedly, but failed to attack, suffering heavy casualties, and retreated in the face of difficulties. For two weeks from May 20 to today, the outskirts of Jilin have been relatively peaceful.</p>
<p>Exhausted Troops Suffer Defeat</p>
<p>Currently, the Communist army is using all its strength to attack Changtu. If the Communist army advances further on the agenda of Kaiyuan, it is Tieling, the gateway to Shenyang. Shenyang has already prepared for defense. At the same time, the Communist army transporting troops in large quantities in southern Liaoning has also taken action. They have made tentative attacks in Fuxian and Pulandian, apparently intending to create a full-scale offensive in the Northeast. However, the Communist army's forces are scattered widely, and they are now at the end of their rope. If they can flee to the vicinity of Shenyang, they will be exhausted troops and will undoubtedly bring about their own defeat.</p>
<p>In short, the Communist army's offensive this time is mobilizing all its forces, seeking only to succeed once and completely abandoning the rear. The total mobilized force reaches 300,000, but only half of the troops have combat experience. The remaining half are new recruits without combat experience, and their combat strength is very weak. The reason why they can carry out widespread and in-depth guerrilla warfare is because the National Army is suffering from too few troops, so few that even the defending forces on the inner line feel insufficient. Recently, reinforcements are being transported to the Northeast, and the war situation will have new developments in two weeks.</p>
<h3>Amidst Calls from All Quarters to Take Back the "Monte Carlo of the Orient"—Macau — Hong Kong, 6th [of the month], Air Dispatch</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The National Senate's 15th General Assembly passed a motion on the 31st of last month to "recover Lushun and Dalian ports and Macau as soon as possible." At the same time, provincial and municipal senates and councils have also passed resolutions to recover Macau. The Guangdong Provincial Senate and various legal entities have even organized a "Committee to Promote the Recovery of Macau" to study specific plans and take practical actions. It can be seen that recovering Macau is a unanimous call from all over the country. In order to investigate the local situation, I recently went to Macau twice. What is recorded below is my observation after the investigation.</p>
<p>Encroached Upon, Territory Lost</p>
<p>The Portuguese enjoyed a prominent period in the 16th century. At that time, their power extended from Europe to India, Ceylon, the South Seas Islands, and even South America in the Western Hemisphere. The extent of their territory was no less than that of the current British Empire. In 1530 AD (the early years of the Ming Zhengde reign), Portuguese people were sent to Macau for the first time. Later, more and more Portuguese people came and forcibly occupied Shangchuan Island, Langbai濖, and the Magge Temple, among other places. Since the Ming Dynasty had no power to drive them away, it compromised by stipulating that they would pay a rent of 500 taels per year. In 1849 (the 29th year of the Qing Daoguang reign), the people of Macau deeply resented the Portuguese for acting arbitrarily and killed the first governor, Amaral. The Portuguese government used this as a pretext to make serious representations to the Qing court. Not only was the rent canceled, but even China's customs could not exist. By the 13th year of the Guangxu reign, the Portuguese saw that China was facing multiple problems, so they officially declared Macau to be their territory. In 1888, China and Portugal signed a treaty in which China agreed that the Portuguese would have exclusive jurisdiction over Macau, but they could not transfer this right to other countries. In this way, although Macau was not formally ceded, in fact, Macau had become a Portuguese colony.</p>
<p>Macau is connected to Zhongshan County, the hometown of the Father of the Nation, and the Portuguese's area of jurisdiction was gradually encroached upon. There was no formally stipulated boundary. The foolish ministers of the late Qing Dynasty believed that Macau was a small place and did not care about its gains and losses. In the Sino-Portuguese Boundary Treaty of the first year of the Xuantong reign, a large area of territory was lost in confusion. The current area of Macau is no smaller than that of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Opium, Gambling, and Prostitution—Three Malpractices</p>
<p>The Portuguese have consistently adopted a high-handed approach to governing Macau. In order to increase tax revenue, they have used all means possible. Everyone knows that Macau is the "Monte Carlo of the Orient," attracting tourists with opium, gambling, and prostitution. Opium was handled by the Monopoly Bureau, and opium dens were everywhere in the streets and alleys. After the end of World War II, in order to avoid international condemnation, the Portuguese government ordered the Governor of Macau to issue a ban on opium on July 1 of last year, stipulating a ban on sales and smoking, and ordering all stored opium to be handed over to the government. On the surface, they banned opium, but the people of Macau only need to pay money to the Health Bureau to obtain a "permit" and can openly buy opium and smoke it freely. The best part is that the government uses the confiscated opium and sells it back to licensed opium smokers at a high price. This ridiculous ban on opium has increased their unexpected income. Gambling is openly allowed. The most luxurious Central Casino is bustling with activity day and night. There are more than 50 other casinos of all sizes in the city, mainly dealing with Fan-Tan and Yin Pai. In addition, there are Shan Pu Piao, Bai Ge Piao, Ma Gou Piao , and other new and strange forms of gambling, with draws held every day. The Portuguese can earn 600,000 yuan a month from casinos alone, exploiting overseas Chinese and profiting from them. How malicious is their intention! Brothels are divided into three grades: the high-end ones are on Rua da Felicidade, Travessa da Felicidade, Rua de Cinco de Outubro, Rua de Inácio Baptista, Rua do Volong and Rua Nova. The middle-class ones are on Rua do Campo and Rua da Boa Vista, and the lower-class ones are on Rua dos Mercadores and Rua dos Ourives. The Macau government also earns a lot of money from prostitutes.</p>
<p>Afraid of Recovery, Fierce in Appearance, Weak in Reality</p>
<p>The Portuguese in Macau were nominally neutral during World War II, but in reality, they helped the evildoers. The Japanese could set up special service agencies in international hotels and openly kill our political workers. The date when this blood debt can be settled is unknown. After the surrender of the Japanese, the Portuguese saw that the general trend was gone and feared that our country would recover Macau by force, so they transferred many troops from East Africa to strengthen their defenses. They still oppressed the Chinese people residing in Macau at will, indicating that they would never give up Macau. However, this fierceness in appearance could not hide their inner panic. It is interesting that they are unusually strict about checking the news. Any news that is even slightly unfavorable to Macau is absolutely not allowed to be published. Newspapers from Hong Kong and Guangzhou must be checked by them before they are allowed to be sold. Therefore, newspapers from Hong Kong and Guangdong are often confiscated. Even a short essay about "mixed-race children" caused the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily to be withheld. A Westerner wrote to the Hong Kong South China Morning Post, saying, "The Macau government confiscated your newspaper because you published news that China would recover Macau. But why do they allow Macau newspapers to publish news that China will recover Hong Kong?" These words are humorous enough.</p>
<p>Recently, the Macau government, seeing that the calls for our country to recover Macau are rising daily, feels even more at a loss. In addition to stepping up the blockade of news, they have also sent a large number of secret agents to Zhongshan County and Guangzhou to inquire about news. They even made a fool of themselves due to inaccurate reporting. It turns out that Zhao Yu, the leader of the "Minzhi Party," wanted to establish a branch in Macau, so he brought a group of followers to Macau to inspect. After getting off the ship, the Portuguese detectives had already been monitoring him. When he was receiving a grand reception from local party members at the Central Hotel, the police suddenly asked him to talk. When he arrived at the police station, the director politely ordered Zhao Yu to leave the country immediately. Zhao, as an important figure of the "Minzhi Party," could not endure such an insult, so he took out a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to argue with reason. As a result, the Portuguese ignored him and forcibly escorted him out of the country with armed police. Later, Zhao arrived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, received reporters, and reported the details of the insults he suffered. In fact, the Portuguese's motive for expelling him was that they were reportedly Zhao Yu's visit to Macau was related to the recovery of Macau. The Portuguese's fierce appearance and weakness in reality are another clear proof.</p>
<p>Population Decline, Loneliness and Desolation</p>
<p>Macau was abnormally prosperous during the war and flourished for a while. After the war, residents moved to the interior one after another, and the population of Macau decreased sharply from 600,000 to 200,000. Moreover, most of those who moved away were wealthy businessmen. Macau's prosperity disappeared with the war in an instant. The current situation in Macau is one of loneliness and desolation, shrouded in an atmosphere of extreme economic downturn. Opium is semi-public, so we will not talk about it for the time being. The largest Central Casino is deserted, and those who place bets are mostly from the working class. Five or ten yuan is considered a large sum. The other casinos can be imagined. Most of the prostitutes have also moved to Hong Kong. Teahouses and restaurants have few customers, and all of them are calling for "price cuts." There is really a feeling of not being able to overcome the differences between the present and the past.</p>
<p>Because of the large decline in population and the market falling, the houses in the high-end residential areas are mostly empty and uninhabited. The low rent is self-evident. Rice, flour, vegetables, fish, and shrimp are all cheaper than in Hong Kong. Macau has no soul. It is heading towards the abyss of decline, perhaps a sign that the end of the Portuguese regime is approaching!</p>

<p>A scene on the streets of Macau</p>
<h3>The Golden Age of Luxury Goods Has Passed: Diamond Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>Diamonds were once popular during the war, but this golden age is coming to an end. Demand for industrial and jewelry diamonds has decreased, and prices are falling. To stabilize the market, diamond production may be reduced.</p>
<p>Industrial diamonds were once rare and highly sought after, but now the market is flooded with them. This industry flourished during the war, but now supply exceeds demand.</p>
<p>Jewelry diamonds were the top-selling luxury item in recent years, but sales have also become sluggish. The reasons for the decline in both types of diamonds can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Consumers have less money than before. High wages during the war absorbed countless new customers into the luxury goods market, all vying to buy diamonds. However, due to job reductions, the income of the new middle class has decreased, and they are no longer as eager to purchase luxury goods.</p>
<p>(2) With the influx of cars, refrigerators, furniture, and other items into the market, consumers are spending their money elsewhere.</p>
<p>(3) Retail stores are no longer as eager to promote diamonds as they were during the war due to increased inventory.</p>
<p>Before the war, diamond sales accounted for an average of 10% of jewelers' total turnover, but during the war, due to the scarcity of other commodities, this suddenly increased to 40% to 50%.</p>
<p>In the United States, which accounts for the largest share of global diamond production, prices are falling across the board. Retail prices are down 15% from last year's peak, wholesale prices are down 20%, small diamonds are down about 10%, and lower-quality diamonds are down 30%.</p>
<p>Retailers are facing high inventories and sluggish sales, which will inevitably drive diamond prices down.</p>
<p>The Diamond Producers Association, which controls 95% of the world's production, is taking preventative measures to prevent further price declines.</p>
<p>The association's main method for stabilizing diamond prices is to reduce production. The association has proposed limiting this year's diamond supply to 60% of the 1946 level. Diamond cutters and polishers have agreed to cooperate and reduce working hours.</p>
<p>Regulating diamond prices by adjusting production has been a feature of the industry for 50 years. This not only protects the interests of the industry, but also protects the interests of diamond holders, as one of the reasons people buy diamonds is to maintain a valuable and portable asset that is not at risk of devaluation.</p>
<p>American diamond merchants are launching a campaign to abolish the 20% diamond tax, as this tax is affecting the sales of valuable gemstones.</p>
<p>The drop in diamond prices is not a tragedy, but a return to normalcy. Diamond sales are still better than before the war. The world sales of the Diamond Producers Association totaled $37,000,000 in 1937, $42,000,000 in 1942, and $120,000,000 in 1946.</p>
<p>The global diamond supply is largely controlled by the London-based Diamond Producers Association. The association is mainly composed of British, South African, and Belgian capital, and conducts military mining in the Belgian Congo and the Union of South Africa.</p>
<p>Although individual diamond mines exist in South Africa, Tanganyika, Brazil, Venezuela, and other places, their output is small and does not threaten the London association's dominant position in the world market.</p>
<p>Because diamond production is strictly controlled, the temporary oversupply will soon be adjusted, and diamond prices will stabilize and not continue to fall. (Translated from the May 6th "World Report" weekly)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Where is Chinese Art Going?</p>
<h3>Natural Art</h3>
<p>— Li Shizeng</p>
<p>This topic is too broad, and I don't know where to start. I can only limit myself to one of my ideas, which could also be said to be one of the paths of Chinese art, which is what I call "natural art" or "natural painting," or "natural painting"; it can also be said to be "painting without learning." I have done many experiments. Does anyone sympathize with my "lack of learning" in painting? I smile!</p>
<h3>Put Your Soul into Your Paintings</h3>
<p>— Fang Junbi</p>
<p>Throughout history, our country has left behind many brilliant works of art. Even today, we dare not compare ourselves with foreign countries in everything else, but we can be proud of our ancient literature and art, and we can feel no shame when talking to others, which allows us to still have a foothold in world culture. How grateful we should be to our ancestors! How hard we should work to protect and promote their unfinished work! Sadly, in the past hundred years, we have not only failed to promote it or intensify our work, but we have not even fulfilled our responsibility to preserve it. Not only can we not preserve it, but we sometimes even destroy it. Think about how unfilial this is and how sorry we are to our ancestors.</p>
<p>"Strive to survive." In this competitive world, this is true not only for countries but also for art. We do not necessarily have to worship foreign countries, nor do we necessarily have to imitate the ancients. In terms of painting, whether it is Western painting or Chinese painting, the difference is only in form and tools. Painters can freely choose to express their feelings. If the feelings are sincere, then they can succeed with any tool. Therefore, no matter whether the painting is simple or complex, freehand or symbolic, methodical or unmethodical, as long as it comes from sincerity, it can become an immortal work. What is sincerity? It is to express one's own soul, not to imitate, not to copy, and even less to steal. Put your whole soul into the painting. When you put down your brush, you must abandon all thoughts of gain, factionalism, and then you will have no scruples and will not want to cater to the tastes of the world or be exploited by some kind of pressure. In addition to "sincerity," being cultivated by poetry, lyrics, and music, and having moral and literary cultivation, history can increase knowledge, and landscapes can broaden the mind. In this way, with a perfect soul, the work will naturally be detached. Even if you don't practice much or have enough skill, you won't be reduced to being low-level or vulgar. Whether it's Western painting or Chinese painting, once it becomes vulgar and low-level, it's hopeless. I hope everyone will unite, learn from each other, and encourage each other, so that the future of Chinese art will be brilliant and shine in the world of art!</p>
<p>"Where is Chinese art going?"</p>
<h3>Read Ten Thousand Books and Travel Ten Thousand Miles</h3>
<p>— Xiong Foxi</p>
<p>To answer this question, we should first ask where are Chinese artists going? My answer is an old saying: "Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles." To put it more concretely, artists in the future should, on the one hand, accept the legacy of Chinese and Western art, and on the other hand, go into the masses and learn from the people.</p>
<h3>Spring and Autumn Blames the Wise: Awareness, Repentance, Effort</h3>
<p>— Chen Shiwen</p>
<p>Chinese art has already entered a state of decline. The reasons are very complicated: war, politics, economics, the times, and the environment all have a great relationship. There are also a few points that are overlooked, which are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) There are many people who work, but few who understand. They work for a long time, even until death, and still don't know if the path they are taking is correct.</p>
<p>(2) Workers are often limited to a certain time and place, limited to a province or a country, or confined to one person or one school. They do not have the understanding and ability to be inclusive and comprehensive, to learn from the past and present, and from the East and West.</p>
<p>(3) The work is either too sloppy or too immature.</p>
<p>(4) Catering to low-level tastes.</p>
<p>(5) On the streets, in living rooms, in exhibitions, in newspapers and magazines, and even in institutions and schools, almost all of them are works of the calendar girl type.</p>
<p>(6) Reputable writers create forgeries without shame.</p>
<p>(7) Selling fake paintings is not a crime.</p>
<p>(8) Only Chinese artworks go to foreign countries to exchange for money, and no artworks come to China for everyone to view and study.</p>
<p>(9) The preservation of antiquities is not thorough and careful.</p>
<p>(10) The construction of art museums cannot be launched.</p>
<p>(11) The government does not care about art.</p>
<p>(12) Art criticism has become a flattering eight-legged essay, a bunch of cliches.</p>
<p>The above are a few points that I thought of at the moment. The author is writing in the spirit of Spring and Autumn blaming the wise, and only hopes that readers will examine themselves, hoping to immediately become aware, repent, and strive forward on a new path. Then Chinese art will have a new life, and Chinese art can be revived. Moreover, the world art center can also be transferred to the East.</p>
<h3>Always "Imitating"?</h3>
<p>— Tan Jinlan</p>
<p>In France, I visited the studios of many famous writers and realized that they were all desperately burying themselves in the study of Chinese art, wanting to find vitamins from it to nourish some of the elements they lacked. That spirit made me feel ashamed and uneasy.</p>
<p>They used everything they learned in their own works - such as Matisse, Geoffroy, and Despiau. But they didn't call it Chinese painting or Chinese sculpture.</p>
<p>But what about us?</p>
<p>Imitating Song, imitating Yuan, imitating Shitao, imitating Siwang, even imitating Matisse, imitating Picasso... The more you imitate, the more proud you are, the more you can be called a great master, the more successful you are. Just like Chinese politics, yesterday we imitated Germany and Italy, today we imitate Britain and the United States, tomorrow we imitate XX. You imitate, I imitate, imitate, imitate, imitate. What kind of art will Chinese art become in the future? Who can answer me?</p>
<h3>Walk Your Own Path</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>During the learning period, follow the teacher. After leaving school, follow the world's famous writers. When you get tired of walking, stop and quietly observe the universe and observe all things - take the true and the beautiful into the picture; put the false and the ugly behind you.</p>
<p>The world is big, the region is wide, and many fertile areas are waiting for us to reclaim.</p>
<p>Especially in the endless sea of art, you can drive freely, without having to follow the waves, and like Columbus, there will always be unexpected new continents to discover. As long as you have perseverance and determination, walk your own path, don't walk the path that others have taken.</p>
<h3>The Boat of Luoxi</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Mount Tiantai is large and the scenery is scattered, and travelers often suffer from insufficient physical strength. Liu Ruanxian left, and the Taoyuan Grotto has long been covered by clouds and fog, and cannot be recognized. The sunset glow of Chicheng is also just an empty name. Only the Luoxi River on Gaoming Temple is clear and playful. A peak stands tall, surrounded by streams, with withered vines hanging down, hence the name "Fishing Boat".</p>
<h3>Popularize Art, Art for the Masses</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Chinese art is too aristocratic, and the masses do not have the financial resources to enjoy it; Chinese art is too subtle, and the masses do not have the intelligence to appreciate it. Therefore, the slogan of popularizing art has been chanted for a long time. It seems that we want to lower the eternal standard of Chinese art to suit the masses, which is like cutting off your feet to wear shoes. Because Chinese art is more profound than the art of any other country, and its moving and aesthetic power is very great! The only wonderful thing is that it is "beyond the image and gets its essence." If Chinese art is created in a rough and shoddy manner, cultivating low-level tastes, then it will lose the true value of Chinese art and lose its subtle effect of cultivating and influencing.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese art should be popularized to the masses of society. The slogan of "popularizing art" should be changed to "art for the masses." The masses do not have the financial resources to enjoy Chinese art. We only need to eliminate internal and external troubles, stabilize society, increase the production power of the masses of society, and improve the economic foundation of the masses of society. Then, when we have enough food and clothing, we will know etiquette and righteousness, and when we know etiquette and righteousness, we will love art! As for the masses not having the intelligence to appreciate it, after the lives of the masses of society are stable, we should first popularize general and complete education (complete education must have the cultivation of art education), and then infuse art knowledge from various aspects. The government should regularly set up various art institutions, gradually promote, advocate, and study, so that the masses can pursue profound art, and do not lower the level of art to suit low-level people.</p>
<h3>Establish Objective Criticism</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>The contemporary art world has a major shortcoming, which is that there are only artists and no critics; therefore, black and white are confused, and right and wrong are completely absent.</p>
<p>Most artists only seek skills and neglect theory. The resulting works are light in weight and quality, reflecting empty, superficial, and low-level consciousness. They cannot achieve the level that art should have, let alone progress!</p>
<p>If this continues, Chinese art will decline, unable to get rid of the old, unable to keep up with the new, and will never be able to hold its head up in the face of the world of art.</p>
<p>If we want to reverse this crisis, we can only first establish criticism, objective and faithful criticism, as I say.</p>
<h3>Art is Education</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>Do not go into the wrong path of low-level tastes. Art should reflect reality and influence the masses of the people's education.</p>
<h3>Walk Slowly</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>All sciences can be "one family in the world" and "universal harmony", and do not need to have nationality; all material civilization and enjoyment can also be "treated equally" and "without distinction". Only literature and art seem to have to have some nationality.</p>
<p>Now we won't talk about literature, let's just talk about art? A country's art has its own path to take, and in the middle, it is inevitable that it will often follow foreigners, but halfway through, it often turns back and returns to its own path. For example, in Chinese painting, during the Six Dynasties, influenced by Buddhism, painters used Indian dyeing methods when painting Buddhist paintings. (Zhang Sengyou painted a one-story temple with concave and convex flowers) But soon this method was no longer used. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, when Matteo Ricci brought Western paintings to China, some painters also "abandoned the old and followed the new" and used Western methods, but their lives were not long. Even Matteo Ricci himself could not help but adapt to Chinese painting methods and paint a kind of Sino-Western mixed painting. As for modern examples, it is even more evident. How many people who studied in Europe and specialized in Western painting still paint pictures after returning to China. Even Japan, which is generally recognized as not having its own art and is the most skilled at imitating, but no matter what kind of "Southern Variation" the Japanese compete in, or what kind of "European Painting" Hamu paints, that Japanese flavor is recognizable no matter what.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it can be said that there are only two major schools of art in the world, the Western school, represented by France, Britain, Germany, and Italy, and the Eastern school, represented by China. These two schools of art seem to be "wandering in a fork in the road" and "not knowing what to do". But the situation is not the same. Eastern art has entered an ivory tower, and Western art has walked out onto the street. Eastern art is "frowning" and "crestfallen" and walking slowly; Western art is "rushing around" and "reckless" and driving a speeding jeep. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Do you want to ask the jeep to walk with us? Or do you want to ask us to race with the jeep?</p>
<p>I think it's better to "walk slowly" and take our own way, rather than follow the jeep and cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Weight and Quality</h3>
<p>— Song Shouchang</p>
<p>I am a music worker, so let's talk about music: Chinese music has gradually been recognized by the general public after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it is showing a vigorous atmosphere. Now it has entered the stage of national construction. At present, when there is a large shortage of music teachers, quality is certainly important for future music, but quantity is actually more urgent than quality. I hope that all music colleges and art colleges with music departments and general normal schools will pay attention to this point, so that the art of music, which is most closely related to life, can be more popular!</p>
<h3>Musical Quotations</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>There is nothing else in the world—even a letter from home is no exception—that excites a soldier's spirit like a good march. (Major Gen. Leonard Wood)</p>
<p>Music is the noblest pleasure in the world. (Dr. F-rank Crane)</p>
<h3>Walk Towards the Road of Revival</h3>
<p>— Guan Zilan</p>
<p>Where is Chinese art going?</p>
<p>Go to the road of revival, go to the road of light;</p>
<p>Go to the road of peace and happiness for mankind!</p>
<p>An artist is a person, a person needed by society, a person in Chinese society. He needs to live in society, he needs reality and the evaluation that reality gives him.</p>
<p>A work needs at least humanity, sociality, and nationality, and then it will not lose its universality.</p>
<h3>Establish New Theories and Create New Forms</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>I believe that if we want Chinese painting to progress, we must first eliminate the seemingly familiar name "Western painting." Integrate national painting and so-called "Western painting," abandon their shortcomings, and take their strengths. In terms of content and appearance, we should get rid of the bad habits of "imitating the ancients," "imitating the present," "conservatism," and "inheritance." Jointly establish new theories and create new forms. If we do so, we can leap to a new realm and produce brand-new works with the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Otherwise, "sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat." - National painters will forever become antique dealers, and "Western" painters will be merchants of foreign goods for life.</p>
<h3>Cooperation and Death</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>Darwin's principle of "natural selection, survival of the fittest" has established an unshakable position in academia, and has always been regarded as a brilliant view in production science and the principle of biological evolution. Unfortunately, in the past or now, this biological law has always been applied to sociology, so that the inequality of human groups, the existence of the wise and the foolish, the rich and the poor, and the contradiction between satiety and hunger, have also become in line with the evolution of nature and are phenomena that should exist. Only in this way can society evolve and progress. This erroneous view has been criticized by scholars. Because under the theory of evolution, it is believed that the poor and hungry people in society are the weak and should be eliminated, and that the rich and well-fed people are the strong and should be above the weak. Such a deduction affirms the reality of society, affirms the unreasonable phenomena in reality, and hinders mankind from seeking the ideal of equality and happiness.</p>
<p>As Hegel said, everything that exists is reasonable, which helped Hitler, and the application of the theory of evolution to social development also became the essence of the Nazi German-defined racial theory. Therefore, the German nation wants to rule the world and conquer the world, because they are the "most excellent" nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, prescient sociologists have not given up their efforts to refute this erroneous application, which may be the achievement of this war. Recently, Reuters reported that Professor Airy of the University of Chicago has established a new theory, modifying Darwin's theory of evolution, believing that animals are more naturally engaged in cooperation than in anti-social behavior, and that the lives of animals (including humans) are actually governed by a rule - that is, "cooperation and death." It is a natural trend for mankind to move towards goodness in personal, social, national, and international aspects, just as people tend towards wisdom.</p>
<p>Reuters' introduction to Airy's theory is very simple, but he has put forward the most important point, that is, non-cooperative organisms in biological phenomena will always perish. This gives us a new concept after reading Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid", regardless of whether it can overturn Darwin's position in biology. It is only from the point of view of social development that this is a correct view of social evolution. Especially when the differentiation of people has become a serious social phenomenon, the relationship between people has become a new topic that sociology should deeply seek, and when international disputes are unfolding, we feel more and more that cooperation means coexistence, and non-cooperation means death. Therefore, Airy's research results are more worthy of our attention and support.</p>

<h3>The Landlord's Face</h3>
<p>— Alin</p>
<p>The rapid increase in the urban population and the failure of urban areas to develop upwards and forwards have caused a serious housing shortage. Although unemployment and high prices have forced some citizens to leave, the unsettled security in various places has brought in many pensioners, which has offset the population that has left. Therefore, the biggest worry for every citizen today, besides the problem of employment, is housing. Today, I don't know how many people are feeling the threat of homelessness under the pressure of being forced to move by landlords, and I don't know how many people are not at peace for a day because they are borrowing and living in the east and west. This is partly due to the housing shortage, and partly due to artificial reasons, that is, the landlord's greed for ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>We know that high deposits and low rents are a common phenomenon at present. Landowners rely on rental income to satisfy their desires, relying entirely on high deposit fees. Calculated as dark interest income, this deposit is a very considerable figure. But the problem lies here. Ninety percent of the houses in the city are in a state of "long-term residence." Big landlords or second landlords cannot collect deposit fees from them, so the last resort is to force them to leave or increase the rent.</p>
<p>As a result, housing disputes have become serious.</p>
<p>At present. The third tenant who is neither a big landlord nor a second landlord is the most distressed. The landlord is like a creditor, and this mean and fierce face always leaves the second tenants with lingering fears. In recent months, the courts have been crowded with housing lawsuits, which is still a direct dispute between the owner and the tenant. The most serious problem is the oppression of middle and lower-class citizens by second landlords. Not long ago, there was a tragedy in which a second landlord stabbed a tenant to death because he was forced to move. Worse, as in the case of the second landlord on Yanping Road who forced the tenant to leave and planned to "sit and eat," it was even more abnormal.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to directly increasing the rent, there are also disguised methods of increasing the rent, that is, paying the rent according to the declared goods (rice). One landlord asked a civil servant tenant to pay six dou of white rice for rent every month. The civil servant found it difficult, and the landlord questioned him, didn't the government issue eight dou of allocated rice every month? He didn't know that the civil servant's family didn't have enough to eat with these eight dou. This incident vividly depicts the face of a landlord.</p>
<p>Regarding this burgeoning rent dispute, the municipal government has asked the municipal council to formulate a plan to make reasonable adjustments, but the result is that the bill has been retained and there is still no solution. Of course, we do not believe that this shows the power of landowners, but we feel that this is a problem that the citizens of Shanghai are most afraid of, just like food. We should face reality and provide relief. Otherwise, the frequent disputes in the near future will lead to bloody tragedies, which will affect social stability.</p>
<h3>Granting Land to Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Xie Tao</p>
<p>The wind and rain all day, sitting idly at the desk is boring, flipping through newspapers and magazines, and in the "Life Daily" I saw that the United States government has a lottery-like preferential method for retired soldiers to grant land to seven retired generals. Originally, between California and Oregon, there was a Tule Lake, which gradually dried up and exposed a large amount of land. During the war, the US government used the labor of Japanese people who were concentrated and detained to engage in reclamation, opening up 86 farms of varying sizes from 61 acres to 140 acres. After the victory, in order to treat retired soldiers preferentially and use this pressed mature land, the government announced that retired soldiers would publicly draw lots to decide, and the winners would receive a farm, but limited to those with more than two years of agricultural experience and possessing 2,000 yuan in cash (this is used for the cost of building houses and cultivating land), and declared that applicants must have honest, thrifty, abstinent, and hardworking personalities. I often see a photo published, a young couple who won the lottery leaning against each other on a small hill, looking down at a vast plain below, pointing and planning where to build their new home, full of light and hope.</p>
<p>We have fertile land that stretches for thousands of miles. Why can't we allocate it to our demobilized soldiers?</p>

<h3>Peach Blossom Fan</h3>
<p>— Ma Gao</p>
<p>This is a story that has been circulating for quite some time, and there have been several different adaptations of it. Even for the same author, there are two versions: the Gui opera and the Sichuan dialect drama being performed this time. However, in this new adaptation, we can clearly see that the author has infused new blood into the old story of a scholar meeting a courtesan while seeking refuge from disaster. He intricately weaves Li Xiangjun's poignant tragedy with the deep context of her era, exposing the political decay of the late Ming Dynasty, the arrogance and tyranny of treacherous and powerful officials, their deceiving superiors and oppressing the people, and their shameless acts of losing integrity and falling into disgrace. At the same time, he sings the praises of the unyielding spirit of the people, the righteous and chaste Li Xiangjun, and even lashes out at the unprincipled Hou Fangyu and the two-faced Yang Wencong.</p>
<p>However, we regret that the author's writing is too scattered, diverting the audience's attention with minor details. If he could have focused more on the central events surrounding Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun, giving them more room to develop, especially Hou Fangyu's "betrayal," if the facts could have been concretely presented, and his contradictory words and actions could be placed in stark contrast, then Li Xiangjun's suffering would feel even more unjust. Similarly, in terms of directing techniques, there are even many places that feel trivial. I think the reason for this is that the playwright and director are the same person, and he unintentionally emphasized his personal preferences, allowing secondary elements to occupy the primary position, thus weakening the climax.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many successful aspects of the direction. His subtlety, meticulousness, spatial arrangement, and atmosphere changes prove him to be a veteran of the stage.</p>
<p>Ling Ruosuo, who plays Li Xiangjun, gives the most energetic performance, achieving excellent results. I have seen her in several plays in Chongqing and Kunming, but this is her most successful performance. Especially in the several scenes where she is the main focus, she performs with ease and avoids artificial gestures, striving to reveal her inner psychology, which is truly commendable and valuable. Gao Bo's Hou Fangyu fails to convey the talent and literary talent of the character, and also fails to show the despicable side of the role. The character of Yang Wencong is a flaw in the author's writing. The character's personality is incomplete, and his changes and duality have too many sharp edges. However, Fei Ke's performance makes him exceptionally satisfactory; he has chosen a suitable appearance for the role. The actor who plays Ruan Sheng is good, portraying the face of a sycophantic and overbearing petty person quite thoroughly.</p>
<p>The stage design seems too hasty, failing to contribute to the desired effect of the script and even undermining the poetic prose feel of the play in some parts.</p>
<h3>Arts and Literature</h3>

<p>The "Xue Feng" semi-monthly magazine, organized by Lü Simian and others, in addition to publishing periodicals on schedule, is currently drafting plans to publish a series of books. It is reported that the books are divided into two categories: one is purely literary, and the other is academic.</p>
<p>Fan Quan recently completed a novella of about 30,000 words, "Happiness," which depicts life on an island, but its content reflects the current turbulent social and political situation. This novella will first be serialized in the "Little Friend" weekly published by the Zhonghua Book Company.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fortunately, after not much effort, most of the twenty or thirty troupe members scattered in various vehicles had been found. After three or four troupe members who had some medical knowledge examined Feifei's symptoms, everyone said that it might be typhus or possibly meningitis.</p>
<p>"Then, who has aspirin? Please bring it out quickly!" Old Zhu asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"No, Old Zhu, I have Daychienphon!" someone quickly replied. "If it's meningitis, Daychienphon is better than aspirin."</p>
<p>Old Zhu also felt that Feifei's illness was closer to meningitis because she complained of a headache as soon as she fell ill.</p>
<p>"Good! Quick! Quick!"</p>
<p>This person hurriedly pulled down the travel bag he was carrying and frantically searched inside, finally finding a glass tube, but when he took it out, there were only two pills left inside.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian clumsily forced Feifei to swallow one pill first.</p>
<p>"Two pills are not enough, Old Zhu. Alas! Let's think of another way!" Lu Qian, who had been standing beside him watching for a while without saying anything, couldn't help but sigh again.</p>
<p>Old Zhu raised his head and looked at everyone's faces for a long time before finally deciding on an idea.</p>
<p>"Everyone, you have all witnessed what has happened in the past two days!" he said emotionally. "I am now very anxious about her condition. According to this child's condition, I must take her on the road immediately. Whether by car, boat, horse, or even on foot, I must quickly get her to Nandan, where there may still be a hospital. Children's illnesses are simple, and early treatment is always better. However, I have to part ways with you all! You may say that I am too selfish, too irresponsible, or even scold me, hate me, or even never cooperate with me again, but I can only let you do as you please..." Several people wanted to interrupt to express that they did not mean that. But Old Zhu immediately waved his hand to stop them. "I am taking Mrs. Hu and her daughter with me. Mrs. Hu herself knows how to treat typhus, but if she stays in Hechi, I don't know when she will recover, and this child has fallen ill. If I don't take care of her, I really can't live with my conscience. Fortunately, we can't perform anymore, and the money is all spent. It's no different from being with the common people. It doesn't matter much to the troupe whether I am there or not. So, I have decided to take this child away first, please forgive me!"</p>
