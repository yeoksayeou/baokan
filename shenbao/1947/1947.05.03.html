<h3>中共訂定鬥爭方案　企圖全面武裝暴動　陝北發現共方秘密文件</h3>
<p>〔中央社延安二日電〕中共自拒絕和談，撤退其駐京滬平渝各地代表團後，爲準備新的鬥爭陰謀，在政府地區，指示該黨潛伏之黨員，策動其外圍組織，發動全面武裝暴動。據悉，毛澤東，劉少奇，張聞天等三人，曾於二月十一日，往瓦窰堡，召開擴大政治局會議，由毛澤東主持，提出地下鬥爭路綫方案，當經決譏通過，於三月十二日發出，由毛澤東，張聞天，周恩來，劉少奇，朱德，葉劍英，彭德懷七人簽署。頃在陝北地方，獲得該地下鬥爭總路綫綱領全文。茲錄如次：</p>
<p>發動民變罷工</p>
<p>政治方面：（一）縮小各地區黨的工作委員會，由極秘密的小組，準備新的鬥爭，發動民變，罷工，反暴，抗租的行動鬥爭。（二）團結進步社團，及自由份子，同路人，聯繫工農，尤其是貧農雇農，與鄕村貧苦窮人，及其代表力量，以不中立姿態，結成民主愛國反獨裁，反內戰的統一戰綫。（三）以民盟民主建國會，三民主義同志聯合會，民主促進會四大基幹層作號召，在工業中心區，吸收羣衆及中立的企業家，作初次勝利的堅固基礎。（四）各地區委，各級核心組織單位，要格外仔細準備，利用一切機會，去動員民主同盟，與農工民主黨行動派的力量，尤其對於行動派及三民派各方組織，發生更密切的聯繫。各地常委及核心，經常派遣代表，列席各地民盟三聯行動三方幹部的會議，幷將其各種會議及個人行動情形，由交通員向中央局，作不斷的報吿，作爲檢討力量的配置。（五）利用港滬與蓉渝之民主促進會，民主建國會上級關係帮助開展黨的交通網，使黨的通吿，能迅速地傳到各區，但必須以保衛自身的秘密爲條件。（六）各地區及特區分配各種行動中的任務，政治局須派特派員主持，或由分局的局委指揮。同時各地區委及特區委，必須經常（最少每月一次）派代表到中央區來列席會議，必須達成中央區與地方區及特區之間密切聯繫。關於今後中央局派遣特派員書信，指令，通吿，電報及所有一切辦法使用，當由直接（A）字交通員隨時通知，盡量溝通交通網，必須利用當地關係，使黨的各地方區領導同志，能迅速的詳細知道彼此間正在成熟的事變，使各地方區，獲得新鬥爭的準備。（七）孤立妥協派及反叛派，分化並吸收其下層　幹羣的策略，在新的鬥爭中是起非常大的作用。在京滬港三區，和各工業中心區，尤其須運用得格外加强，幷要很快速的組成鼓動團，到各黨派及「民校」（按指國民黨與政府而言）各機構中，職工方面，黄色工會裏，尤其是各交通機構中，傳播恐怖消息，及本黨的政策。各地區的鼓動員，須按期抽調給予新的嚴格的訓練（以黨員爲限），以加强新的方針施用。（八）在目前形勢下，「民校」尙不致對民盟方面的首腦，採取高壓，要盡量利用他們的地方資力，及各地區社會關係潛力，專門阻止反動方面大團結，及中間派的接近「民校」。在積極方面，是吸收其幹部，把領導權奪取過來，高度的發展我們的核心及我們政策的深入。在行動上，必須遷就容忍與民盟各中間派，極力趨於一致，造成統一的政策同盟，進一　　步促成全國民主派，中間派的大團結，作全國性的聯合，打倒四大家族的統治權。這個大團結，大同盟，總動員的原則，是反蔣和平統一。這種民主大團結，能獲得初步的勝利，就是减輕了革命的無產階級和其，他勞動者建立民主統一中的困難。（九）黨的鼓動團與核心，經「民校」，民社，靑年三方面，以聯合內外一致行動，奪取他們的下級幹部，及分化其組織，使他們的許多普通黨員，都拋棄其對領袖的信譽，促其參加民盟三聯，與民建的政策。這就是新鬥爭行動中，可以造成人民革命的聯合橋樑，也就是全民性的反四大家族的關鍵的主要的任務之一。</p>
<p>成立游擊兵團</p>
<p>軍事方面：（一）統一地方武力，組織成立游擎兵團部，擴大民變，武裝起義，使「民校匪軍」分散兵力，增加守備。（二）所有地方武裝組織，各武工隊。民兵自衛軍，工農武裝隊，游擊突擊隊，均在游擊兵團部統一指揮下活動。（三）在「民校」區各鄕村及市鎭迅速成立武裝民變起義司令，每部及支郃分配力量，製定計劃，以武工隊，突繫營，狙擊通，去佔領有決定性的地點，以響應民變，但在發動起義前，必須週密地特別注意，從民間各方面，搜集駐在地「白匪」部隊的行動及其成份和佈置，和對民間的暴行。若不作爲這種佈置，就成爲可笑的獃子。我們絕對不要漂亮的決議，無把握的行動。（四）對於「民校」區普通武裝民變起義行動，按照下列中央政治局與革命軍委會決議進行：（甲）無諭何時何地，都不要把武裝民變起義，當作兒戲，切忌重犯過去「秋收暴動」與「全國都市暴動」的錯誤路綫，而要在一開始起義時，就知道必須進行到底。（乙）民變起義，如同一種戰爭，黨委與司令部及兵運委在準備發動時，須愼重檢討。造成民變形勢，決定民變形勢，爲民變行動的各種條件。</p>
<p>加强各級軍事黨委的權力。爲了使軍事的形勢，轉變爲全面革命的軍事鬥爭，中央政治局與軍委會，認爲必須加强紀律和思想的統一，指揮軍事的正確和軍事行動的一致，決定各級軍事黨委的權力如下：甲，各級軍事黨委，對於各軍區，各兵團，各部隊長所發的單獨指示，與軍令絕對有效，違者處死。乙，各軍區司令及各級兵團部隊長指揮員的指示軍令，如無黨委副署，絕對不生效力。丙，各級軍區司令員和各級指揮員與黨委的軍事行動，有參差時，必須以黨的決定爲行動。丁，在緊急必要時，各級黨委對於武裝司令員及部隊指揮長，有先行扣留撤職，然後呈報上級，違者處死。戊·各級政治部及各指導員，直屬於黨委軍區司令員與各級指揮員，不得干澦工作。</p>
<p>破壞電訊交通</p>
<p>關於各級軍事黨委在地下鬥爭中的任務：（一）各級軍事黨委在各部隊中，對於「三大紀律」與「八項注意」的執行，必須十分澈底。（二）戰爭決定於加强鬥爭，更決定於持有武器的士兵忠實的戰鬥，因此關於黨在各部隊中的活動，須以士兵爲中心，小組爲基礎。（三）關於武裝民變起義襲擊，必須決定勝負關頭，在決定勝負地點，集合大大超過敵人的力量，因爲否則民變武裝，就會被祖成更好武器優良的敵人消滅下去。（四）武裝兵變起義，要獲得成功，就須猛烈的展開進攻電話局，電報員，火車站及各種渡河的橋樑。（五）佔領各種交通機關及交通要隘，和大規模破壞火車軌返，奪取車翻，是爲使起義者能利用這些機關工具，孤立「白黨匪軍」的武裝力量。（六）起義前夜，首先普遍地破壞火車軌道，是有巨大意義的。佔領橋樑與毁路，改變地形，對於起義中心區與谷邊區的聯繫，是有菲常重要的意義。</p>

<h3>社論　國內局勢的新展望</h3>
<p>一昨立法院會議，新任行政院院長張羣出席報吿今後施政標的，其言曰：『從多方努力，使政府因戡亂不得已而採取之軍事措施迅速結束，俾克早日實　用政治方法根本解決國內科紛，恢復統一的目的。』再則曰：「目前經濟極爲困難，影響國計民生甚鉅，當力求收支平衡，使兩者之差額盡量减少。同時亦當努力通貨之整理……遵守憲法精神，保障人民自由，嚴懲貪汚……，」凡上所言，言簡而意賅，且其所包括之範圍又極廣，實在値得一般國人深深玩味。張院長的報吿，雖是對立法院而作，但經由立法院，也可以說是對國民而發。他的報吿及解答，或則有關政治的局勢，或則有關民族經濟當前的危難，或則有關我國的國際關係，都能爲扼要的闡明，能度謙和，不失政治家的風度，實予國人以良好的印象。據報載消息，當，對於旣定國策的抨擊多於就如何執行的國策質難，「對於應先統一抑先和平一點之詢問，頗爲熱烈，」且有希望「行政院能以百分之五十的力量應付和平統一問題」者。情况熱烈，可以想見。</p>
<p>由於此次立法院的院會，使我們對於此後國內局勢的發展，更寄予股切的期望。我們感覺到欣慰的是此次行政當局之出席立法院院會者，除張院長外，還有副院長·國防·財政·交通及有關各部會的首長，行政當局出席人數之多，似乎向所未有，加以張院長態度的議和，各立法委員發言的熱烈，充分表現了立法行政兩方面關係的好轉，可見今後的行政與立法必將處於相輔相成的地位，不致再蹈過去的覆轍。這是値得國人可以欣慰的一點。立法定制，原是立法院的權限，至於法律制度如何運用，如何執行，則又是行政當局的職司。立法行政，本應相輔相成，視同一體，祗因過去的關係未臻妥善，遂致立法行政之間，　然類了鴻溝，這實在是至足遺憾的。今行政當局一變過去習尙，樹民主憲政之風範，此後立法行政兩方面關係的更趨緊密，對於國計民生，自屬至有裨益。</p>
<p>不論軍事第一也好，政治第一也好，經濟第一也好，當前國內的局勢，此三者誠如張院長所云，實有關迎，難以劃分。在現制下的行政院雖非最高國策的決定機構，實握國家施政的大權，作爲政府機構的一部門，它在政治方面的意義，似乎祗應該限於國策的執行及一般行政。行政院長也許可能担負起若干論性質本不屬於行政院的任務，此項任務的担負爲法制以外的事，嚴格地講，原非分內之責。因此，所謂「新政院爲一政治性政府，盼能以百分八十之努力，謀求和平統一之實現，」雖對於國家人民抱有十二分的衷誠，總覺得有些弦外之音，跡近有些兒踰越常軌。至於和平統一，統一和平，此一次序的安置雖所關甚大，但到了今天，似亦不必重行提出，經過和平統一的失敗，然後有統一和平的決策。國策旣定，統一原沒有拒絕和平，此際而將此問題重予提出，似在政治的智慧上不免有失考慮。全國的人民沒有不希望和平的，就是在政府，也莫不如此。我們讀了張院長的報吿，「從多方努方，使政府因戡亂不得已而採取之軍事措施迅速結束，俾克早日實現用政治方法根本解決國內糾紛，恢復統一的目的，」可見政府的衷懷，就在不得已而用兵之際，猶希望軍事措施的得以迅速結束，早日實現用政治方法根本解決國內糾紛，恢復統一的目的。我們歡迎有這一態度的表示，此誠足爲忍讓精神的至高表現。</p>
<p>然而噹前一般國民所希望於新政府者，自然在如何能解救他們切身所感受的經濟危難。軍事政治局勢的不解決，固然不能澈底解決當前的經濟局勢，但目前的經濟局勢也決不能等待到軍事政治局勢解決後再來想辦法。治本縱尙需時，治標不可無計。所以從一般國民的立塲來說，人民所希望於政府者，經濟危難的减輕較朮於任何方面；因爲這對他們本身直接利害所關，所以期望也更殷切。就目前的局勢論，此一經濟問題的核心，似乎環繞在經濟緊急方案的實施，誠如張院長所云，此一方案的實施，確曾收到相當的效果。倘使當時沒有此一方案的提出，似乎述現階段這一種經濟局勢也不可能。但擺在眼前的事實，也有可以使我們値得注意的幾點；單就米價一項而論，自方案實施時的六萬餘元，兩個多月來漲至卅餘萬元，上漲之速，前此所無。足見政府對於物價的控制，不因經濟緊急方案的實施而收效；反以此一方案的實施而暴漲。物價旣無法凍結，所可能凍結者僅工資與薪給，在此一不平衡的發展下，勢將招致嚴重的社會不安。此外黄金外匯的黑市價格雖不見於報紙，然黑市價格的存在，似亦爲無可否認的事。依今日的形勢言，目前的經濟危難，似較甚於頒發經濟方案的當時。如何解輕當今的經濟危難，我們希望政府趕緊能有辦法拿出來。</p>
<p>張院長蒞任之初，就發表經濟問題應以經濟方法解決；任立法院會議席上，又說：緊急經濟措施，雖對本年二月經濟危機之渡過，大有效果，但已不足應付經濟現况，政府當局已在檢討中，然後決定加以修改或廢止，此誠不失爲一種正確的論讀。經濟上的現象，原受經濟法則的支配，我們一時固然可以藉政治的力量來管制經濟上的變化，但這樣的管制不能經久，其效果如何，也是問題。對於目前的經濟危機，我們希望政府拿出來的辦法，能不再蹈過去偏重政治力量的覆轍。等到經濟的危難漸形减輕，人民的生活較形穩定的時候，國家民族的發展纔有眞正的前途。這實是今政府的一大考騐。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會通過　設立聖地調查會　猶代表可獲准陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約一日電〕阿拉伯各國要求此次聯合國特別大會討論結束英國委任統治及宣布巴勒斯坦獨立一案，已歸失敗，大會今日以廿四票對十五票加以否決，十票棄權。主席亞如哈令指導委會明晨開會，決定猶太代表是否准許參加問題，並於午後提交大會審議。今日午後會議歷四小時半，阿拉伯各國自始即知其奮鬥無望，但仍爭論不休。大會最後將英國所提設立事實調査委會一項建議列入議程。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約一日電〕美國今日已突然改變態度，不再反對猶太人參加聯大特別會議，討論巴勒斯坦問題一議，並已在覓取方式，俾使猶太人可以派代表參加，此顯係猶太公會一再籲請杜魯門總統促國務院改變立塲後所獲得之結果。但英國仍不改變其立塲，英美所取策略，今已初次顯示趨於歧與。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕英美兩國對於聯大會討論巴勒斯坦問題是否准許猶太代表出席一事，意見紛歧。大會指導委會今日開會予以討諭，大致猶太代表可獲准以某械方式出席。據悉，美代表奧斯汀將主張准許猶太代表出席五十五國政治委會發言，惟無參加表決權。該委會即爲變相的大會，所有重大問題均須由其審査，然後提出大會表決。惟英國已聲明準備反對。美國另一主張爲設一特別委會，由猶太代表出席發言，然後向政治委會提出報吿，如此即可避免造成准許非會員國出席之先例。英國對此聞可加以考慮。惟猶太公會已表示，除在五十五國全體之前發言外，決不願出席少數國家所組織之委員會。英國則僅允猶太代表出席巴勒斯坦問題調査委員會陳述意見。</p>

<h3>貝文論世界和平　以耐心及期望勗勉國人</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教一日電〕貝文外相在其選區內向工黨會議演說，談及莫斯科會議時，曾以耐心及期望爲勗。貝文謂：余認各項問題均屬嚴重問題，故與其倉卒成立並非眞正和平，不如費去較長時間以建立良好的和平，此項問題，雖僅爲德國或有關歐洲之問題，但其影饗所及，實與整個世界和平有關。吾人若成立不良的妥協辦法，將使世界再循錯誤的途徑進發，因此鑄成大錯貽害後代子孫。貝文繼述及前被德國佔領各歐洲國家之局勢，謂各該國之死亡率甚高。渠過波蘭時，波總理曾吿以波蘭前有人口三千五百萬，今日祗有二千二百萬。華沙城僅具骨架，城中心完全被焚，乃係納粹撤退前故意焚毁者。歐洲其他部份，其整個經濟亦悉受破壞。貝文曰：在重建此等國家之際，不免困難重重，各該國之政治家當放下刀劍，建立和平，而在製造和平之際，更須使其子孫以後不復再事互毆。本人在莫斯科時，雖遭失望，但並不感覺不耐煩云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦一日電〕關於貝文外相在莫斯科與史達林元帥所舉行之會談，英國外務部發言人本日對此仍拒不透露內容，僅謂，某英國記者曾來電稱，史帥對於英國將魯爾區目爲「被征服之省份」而强迫徵募德國工人並無異議云云，此說並非事實。史帥僅表示其本人明瞭英國强迫德人工作出於不得已云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦一日電〕貝文外相自莫斯科返國後，本日出席內閣會議，報吿四國外長會議之經過。此外，前任首相邱吉爾本日要求下院討諭外交政策，惟樞密大臣莫里遜未能決定討論外交政策之日期。</p>

<h3>聯合國軍參團　工作報告要點</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約一日電〕聯合國軍事參謀團成立逾年，其遲遲未能提出之工作報吿，終於已提交其上　機構安理會。安理會已決議於三日公開宣佈，此長達九十頁之報吿。據非正式消息，報吿中計分四篇，四十二節。四篇爲（一）導官，，（二）報吿本文，（三）附錄，解釋未能協議之建議者，（四）另一附錄，包括該代表團之意見，四十二節之中，聞獲協議者十六節，意見分歧者十六節，聞未協議者較協議者爲多。然軍事參　團已協議各國軍隊應由其本國軍官統率，有權向其本國政府報吿，又最高統帥，應由安理會選任。關於最高統帥問題，聞報吿附錄中，法國之意見爲安理會亦將選派在聯合國最高統帥指揮下陸海空軍之總司令。未協議之最重要事實如下：</p>
<p>（一）聯合國未來軍隊之數量及各大國小國攤派軍額之比率；（二）七大國是否供給數國完全相同之軍隊及配備；（三）獲得各聯合國家允許聯合國軍隊使用其基地及設備之方法。其他未獲協議者，包括以下諸點，各國軍隊在侵略被制止後之召還事宜，又各國軍隊在等候安理會命令時，應駐屯何處，如何由其本國供應。預料對國際軍隊貢獻最大之國家代表，將被選爲最高統帥，然此事尙待蘇聯及其他委員國家關於未來國際軍隊組織異見之解決。就參謀團之報吿觀之，成立國際軍隊之前瞻，極爲暗淡。此非僅由於各委員國家未改變之決定，即不能用國際軍隊制壓，包括五强在內之軍事衝突。然據稱鑒及目前未安定之國際局勢及各大國之異見，參謀團之能擬出報吿，即係一種成功。</p>

<h3>義務勞動代金　當局重提舊案　決交工務局社會局民政處草擬辦法　市府預計可收五百六十億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一度爲市參議會所否決之國民義務勞動代金，昨日市政會議上又提出討論。其計劃及實施辦法，決議由工務局會同社會局及民政處擬具之。記者特於昨晚走訪工務局長趙祖康，據稱：草擬計劃當不外下列三原則，即（一）何種方式？根據去年度之決定，係採取代金方式。按中央規定，凡屬壯丁，每年須爲國家義務服役十天，不出勞力者可以現金折代之。本市人口共計四百餘萬，壯丁人數，以全人口五分之一計，即有狀丁八十萬之數。若依據目前工務局臨時雇工之工資，每日平均約爲七千元計，十日爲七萬元，則市府可收入之國民勞動代金總數約爲五百六十億。惟據趙局長表示：除微收代金方式外，或擬參照目前該局濬河之分區徵工辦法。因本市眞如·江灣·浦東·龍華各區疏河工程之成績良好，故分區徵工方式，當亦在考慮之列。（二）何種工作？工作之範團，總不外水利及道路。據趙局長表示：若分區徵工，則視各區之需要，先後興工。若全市一律以代金方式，則工作之進行，務求其各區平均，俾全市市民之利益均等。（三）何種組織？此則在南京方面，已組織國民義務勞動委員會，專司其戰。本市方面是否亦將組設委員會或成立勞動服務社，當會同社會局及民政處討論之。其計劃及實施辦法草案擬具後，即提付市參議會第三次大會決定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕社會部谷部長昨對記者稱：本人此次在滬徵詢勞資兩方對改善職工生活之意見後，將會同市府及社會部再度硏討，然後提出一綜合方案，呈請中央採擇。谷氏昨日上午召集總工會及各工會負責人訓話，詳述當前之經濟危機及中央之政策，謂政府決保陣工人之最低生活，但同時須顧到產業前途，否則覆巢之下無完卵，只有在國民經濟存在之下，方有階級利益可言。下午四時起，谷氏假吳開先公館內約集總工會及工會高級人員二十餘人，就改善工人生活問題交換意見。工方代表建議有條件的恢復生活指數給薪，谷氏以其能兼顧勞資，兩方利益，認爲合理。晚間吳局長設宴招待，便商失業工人救濟辦法。晚間十時，中國工業協會總會各常務理事吳蘊初，田和卿，胡伯翔等連袂來訪，各代表以工業會法之原則經十中全會通過後，迄今四載有奇，但全文尙在行政院審査之中，希望谷部長將工業界希望轉陳中央，俾得早日完成立法程序。谷氏今日與產業界代表會晤後，即搭夜車返京。</p>

<p>加强聯緊貫通意見</p>
<p>關於各區民代表會者：（一）望各區當選之市參議員與區民代表會加强聯繫，區民代表會開會時，請參議員列席。（二）區民代表會之經費，每月僅三萬二千元，希望即予增加，並准專用辦事人員。（三）請市府民政處每月召集谷區區民代表會主席，舉行工作會報一次。（四）若干事務，如修築道路等，原可由各區自行發動，工務局處於技術上協助餐導之地位，利用各該區自己之力量完成。（五）區民代表會對於區之財政監察權，並無明文規定，但各區有自籌事業費之規定，此點似爲立法上之疏忽，應請建議中央迅予補充規定。</p>

<h3>劉敬宜談今後民航計畫　發展邊省交通　開闢國際空綫　賠本在所不計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司新任總經理劉敬宜已於前日履新，昨與記者詳談發展今後民航事業之計畫稱，國內航綫方面，現已有相當規模，此後目標第一爲視經濟能力所及，設法改善設備，第二爲適應政治，開闢新航綫。例如通至新疆等邊疆省份之航綫，自商業立塲言，純爲虧本之舉，但在國家政治上則有重大價値，故非辦不可。國外方面，因二十世紀爲航空世紀，歐美各國，即小如荷蘭比利時等亦均有國際航綫，中國自不能落後，故即使賠錢亦要替國家支持，例如即將開航之中美航綫，估計每單程飛行一次之費用約須二萬五千美金，而客貨收入則僅二萬美金，換言之，每飛行一次，即須虧蝕五千美金。但雖然如此，仍不能不辦。該航綫六月中即可正式通航，此外中法中英等新航綫均已由政府當局在接洽之中。劉氏繼述其另一理想，渠認爲北平乃世界最美麗都市之一，若能在旅行及食宿方面盡量求其安全舒適，必可吸引國際旅客前往遊覽，如此且可使國家收入大量外匯，故今後中航公司對於飛北平航綫將力求發展改善云。</p>

<h3>市長昨召紡管會委員　討論棉紗議價問題</h3>
<p>今日開小組會接照成本商議價格</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日中午邀宴紡管會全體委員於安福路官邸。席間對棉紗議價及轉口問題，曾交換意見，茲探誌大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）議價方面，各委員以目前政府所議定之廿支標準紗每件四百六十萬元之價格，實感不敷成本。吳市長當表示：政府以本市四月份棉紗議價，迄未議出，認爲因循不決，殊非對策，故遂先行議定。討論經過，當決定於今日上午十時，在紡建公司召開議價小組會，按實際生產成本，再議價格，俾交紡管會核議後，送陳中樞當局決定。</p>
<p>轉口問題尚須核議</p>
<p>（二）棉紗轉口問題，經討論一過，原則上決定輸往東北及華北之棉紗，限制應稍嚴格，採取限額制度。華中方面，因價格相差不大，不妨暫採寬限政策。該項原則，交由紡管會草擬辦法，候開會時核議後，再送中樞當局決定。</p>
<p>棉紗議價應求合理</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紡織業某權威語記者：此次政府決定廿支標準紗護價，每件四百六十萬元，如以聯總棉花或限額進棉花成口本計算，尙稱够本。惟如按目前國棉成本計算，即吿不敷。渠稱：政府對議價之決定，大致着重於原始成本。而一般廠商，則咸着眼於再生產成本。據渠觀察：議價之決定，如純按原始成本計算，則鑒於目前物價騰漲之速，各廠或將因此而無法維持再生產。但如純依再生產成本計算，政府認爲與無異已承認黑市之價格爲合法，亦非妥善。故合理之談價，似應從原始及再生產兩成本中，覓求一平均之生產成本，尙不失爲顧全事實之合理價格。照此推算，廿支標準紗之適中議價，大致應在五百萬至五百五十萬元之間云。</p>
<p>染織業建設改善點</p>
<p>紗布加强管制後，由滬轉口運往北方各口岸紗布，除紡建公司以外，均已暫吿停頓，靜候紡管會規定核給許可證辦法。本市機器染織業同業公會，昨特臚陳意見呈請紡管會採納：（一）目前紗布議價未能顧及紗廠之再生產，本市紗價之超越如無過份出入，似屬情有可原。在本業爲維持生產，隨時購入棉紗，實有不得不然之苦衷，應請不吝旣往，免予置議。（二）紗布轉口核准許可辦法，建議改善辦法如次：甲·取消運銷商及製造商登記手續，凡攸關紗布各工業或商業同業公會會員，均有由請運銷資格。乙·紗布轉口數量之審定，除棉紗以上海織廠之用餘數量計算外，應請以每一工廠量百分之八十爲限，在此限額內，得隨時申請許可轉口，不加限制。丙·由請許可手績應責成同業公會力求簡化。丁·管制對象應以棉紗及白坯布爲限。戊。管制基數請酌予提高，以恤商艱。棉紗以一大包爲起點，棉布在四十疋以下者免領許可證書。上述呈文由該會派遣潘士浩而呈紡管會，紡管會方面正在研究中。如所呈各節確屬有理由者，當提交紡管會議中加以討論云。</p>
<p>棉紗綿布繼續增漲</p>
<p>紗市因紡建公司改經配售辦法，人心又見堅挺。塲外喊價二十支紗，以漂布上漲甚勁，染織廠進胃極濃，節節上升。二十支雙喜四百六十萬，豐年筒紗四百七十萬元，軋漲二十萬至四十萬。十六支紗毛巾廠胃口不健，價漲甚微。紡建公司照例開售無牌支紗，四十二支寳光草包九千九百八十萬元，三十二支仙桃筒紗六千九百六十萬元，全日各牌粗細紗均升自三十萬元至五十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨棉布市况：初開平穩，二十支特細布價喊二十四萬三千元有供售，旋以紡建開紗，聞今後將對同業號家限制配售，每星期僅可　配一次，致人心突見俏　，塲中新買戶活躍，喊價驟高。尤以元　嘰漲勢更强，四君子金印由二十六萬八千元步升至二十八萬五七千元，二十支特細布由廿四萬七千元升至廿五萬五千元。十二磅龍頭細布狂升二萬二千元爲三十萬零五千元，一定如意漂布在各方搜求中，每疋上升三萬元爲三十三萬元，其餘色布元布藍布及士林布等，市俱步昂。</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日開始按照新訂辦法配售棉紗，共售各支紗一二一一件。按照規定，昨日純屬廠商申購，申購單共四二一張。經此次改變配紗辦法後，昨日甲級廠商，每家最高可配到四十八件，乙級廠商，每家最高可配到廿七件。</p>
<h3>產區價格報低　食米漲風稍歛　豆油雜糧均見回挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因產區價格稍落，及吳市長諭令提高本市白粳門售限價至每石廿萬元後。漲風已吿稍歙。市塲到貨仍稀，共祇一一九五石半。白粳黑市做廿三四萬元。白元高貨做廿六萬五千元，中貨廿四萬四千元。社會局於南北兩市塲共拋出白米九千包，價十四萬七千元。</p>
<p>米號憑戶證出售配給米</p>
<p>自當局規定市民向米號購買配給米須憑戶籍證後，昨日起凡已領得配米之米號，即邀照此辦法實行。社會局並通知各米號，自昨日起所有門售米一律須登記呈報候核。當局並派員四十人至登記米號査賬，若發現有弊端時。即取消其配售資格。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油麵粉雜糧昨日均告瀉跌。本廠豆油做五十二萬元，挫落四萬元。靑島吉普桶生油喊五十四萬元，亦回小四萬元。小車蔴油五十五萬元，跌五萬元。凈生油五十萬元，小三萬元。洋粉喊十二萬元，跌去二萬元。本粉八萬五千元，小八千元。鈇皮六萬六千元，亦挫落九千元。大連元豆做十八萬元，跌五千元。江北苞米九萬元，小四千元。漢口苞米則做八萬九千元。開封黄豆喊十六萬七千元。崇明沙赤豆十九萬元，小二千元。九江生仁做廿八萬三千元。營口豆餅九萬元，回小五千元，長字豆餅五萬六千元，跌四千五百元。牲記豆餅五萬三千五百元。挫跌六千元。</p>
<p>食油有恢復自由買賣說</p>
<p>〔本報訊昨日食油行市，因聞當局暫准各廠按市自由買賣，價格遂賡續趨跌，計各擋食油，均小二三萬元。惟以昨日　面銀根緊俏，各廠雖有售出，成交不多，共約一千餘担之數。聞當局有准各廠先按市試行恢復自由買賣，以視成績如何，而後決定食油對策。業中人談；如按昨日本廠豆油每担五十二萬元之價格計算，則各另售商門售價，每斤最高應爲五千六百元云。</p>
<p>本月份配粉照過去辦理</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月份之配粉辦法，政府與福新，阜豐，茂新，華豐等五大粉廠，雖尙未洽定，惟日來配粉，仍按照過去慣例配售，每日一萬包，配價每袋四萬五千元。聞福新麵粉廠之負責人榮氏，業已去京與糧政當局洽談維持配粉及疏通小麥來源辦法。又昨日各廠除供給配粉外，亦以麵粉按市拋售云。</p>
<p>大批雜糧等昨運往廣州</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海黔輪昨晨駛粵，裝生仁一萬〇一百五十餘包，生油一百二十餘件，豆子一千四百包。又疋頭三百四十件，棉紗六十餘件，運往廣州。</p>
<h3>推銷美金債券　舉行擴大茶會</h3>

<h3>綱絲玻璃　改列附表三甲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕綱絲玻璃一項，原列在附表三乙，爲禁止輸入品之一。刻輸管會已決定改列入附表三甲，准許恢復輸入云。</p>
<h3>我國生絲出口减少</h3>
<p>紐約市塲幾已絕跡</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日專電〕美商業部稱：中國於去年首十一個月出口生絲一萬一千五百包，其一九三九年生絲出口則爲七萬五千一百五十包。出口數量之所以减少，保因中國生絲價格萵漲，加以外匯値價低落，因而减低美元之購買力，致使紐約市場之生絲購買，實際上等於禁止，該部報吿稱：相反方面，日本横濱與神戶，於今年二月則有一萬一千一百七十五包生絲用以出口，同時分配機構則指撥六萬八千七百零七包生絲用以出口。</p>
<h3>華股扶搖直上　後市突起回風</h3>
<p>華　昨以銀根先緊繼鬆，故市價初低後高，中途復多漲達限度者。熟料臨高咸存戒懼，謠傳助賣，永紗慘跌達七百元之巨，餘股頗多呈有行無市者。</p>
<p>晨開　人心大俏，中絲火柴新華漲停，餘亦見高，遞永紗開後二一八號五四號一一七號九一號一〇五號一五二號一〇六號一八八號有售，自六一〇〇元起盤低至五九一〇元。四號一八〇號五四號八二號一九〇號三五號八三號一〇二號八九號俱進，新亞漲達限度，回升至六一四〇元。一四二號一五三號九七號八五號四號脫手，退至六〇五〇元內，此時商務漲停而稍盤。入後二二四號一五四號八三號一八五號賣到六〇〇〇元內，銀根見緊，永紗掉期二〇〇元有人貼出，人心不支，二三一號三六號九四號九一號二八號一七一號一六〇號紛售，遞永紗乃跌至五八四〇元左右，人心不定，一有買戶，立起回風，大通新華忽吿漲停，二三一號地二二三號二二四號八三號九五號一四號一九六號連袂購納，美亞亦吿漲停，近午遞永紗盤高至六二三〇元左右而後略盤。結果較前收計永紗新光永公信和景福各漲半成强，美亞新華漲停，勤興升一成，申法跌一成，華豐微升。遞交計美亞漲停，永紗信和永公景福各升半成，華豐微升，勤興新光各　一成左右。冷股大通商務火柴新亞漲達限度，榮豐五和跌半成，中絲景綸升一成，內衣漲半成，餘股升降不一。</p>
<p>午後　聞銀根鬆濫，人心再好，遞永紗經過數度小掙扎後，由一六七號九一號七六號九七號一四號買進，美亞火柴景綸中絲新華大通紛紛漲達停板，自六二一〇元盤高至六三五〇元。二二三號一二〇號一五三號有售，回落數十元，新亞勤興亦達漲停，一八五號一二九號八號四號二〇五號一三七號八二號一五二號七五號八五號俱進，曾漲到六四三〇元，一〇五號二二四號賣出盤低，入後忽聞重行審查華股內容，以及加緊管制物價等說，賣風一起，散買爭先了結，一時斬殺大盛，二二四號八九號九四號八三號七八號一五三號一三三號一六號一一七號　爭售、統益榮豐跌停，遞永紗曾慘瀉至五七三〇元左右。八五號一七一號九七號等趁低補進，曾回升至六〇〇〇元外，爲狀十分飄忽。最後在五九五〇元左右掙扎，結果較前收計永紗成交少，尙升半成，美亞漲停，勤興新華新光漲停後有回，各升一成光景，景福升半成，永公華豐微升，信和微降。遞交計永紗信和升半成左右，勤興升一成弱，景福華鬆微降，永公稍升，美亞漲停後有回，升一成弱，冷股新亞景綸商務漲停，中絲火柴大通漲停後有回，各升半成至一成，榮豐跌停，統益跌停後有回，跌半成。內衣升一成，中紡跌半成強，塲外各股再漲。</p>
<h3>公債平淡</h3>
<p>公債昨更見平庸，統丙量開一六〇〇〇元，高價一六六〇〇元，低價一五五〇〇元而後轉盤。業中人若潤德三六〇室有售，五〇三室五一二室則進，結果較前收計各債均漲起七八百元不等，成交不過四百萬左右。</p>
<h3>外股不斷上進</h3>
<p>傳綱業有換會　德廳股票之訊</p>
<p>外股昨鋼業有結束及換會德豐股票之訊，猛漲較多，英聯成爲證券帮追逐目標，亦頗俏利。洋行帮在午前買進會德豐業廣等。午後證券帮脫售，廣帮北帮則納。怡紗晨開六七〇〇〇元，自六六二〇〇起，盤高至六八八〇〇元而後稍定。結果較前收計輝業電話升成半，英聯升一成，會德　墾植升半成，餘股均吿微升</p>
<h3>糖商赴台購糖</h3>
<p>自台糖公司對於糖商停止配給以後，市上台糖現貨日見稀少，乃造成黑市狂漲現象。該業公會爲應同業迫切需求起見，爰特集合資金派員赴台直接採購。聞已訂購一萬餘包，不日即可啓運來滬。按中砂台省市價每司馬擔約値台幣八十元，外加運費稅項僅合法幣卅四萬元左右，與黑市價相差十餘萬元之多。故預料抵滬後，糖市當可敉平。</p>

<h3>杭州又鬧米風潮</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>四月卅四日杭州快訊</p>
<p>今年二月間，國內奔騰澎湃的黄金浪潮波及到杭州市的時候，米價也跟着扶搖直上；於是又有打米店的謠傳。市政當局急着召集有關的各方負責人商談，米商堅持產地貴了，無法抑低，祗有將存在四行裏的米每天提出一千石交各米店平糶。市政府在沒有比米商所提的辦法更好之下，聽了米商的意見，每天由四行提一千石交各米店平糶。當時定價七萬三千元一担，每一平戶限買五升，面且限到店裏去買，那裏知道由四行提到各米店，由各米店再出舊的米都是碎米憐米，所以有些中等人家，情願出十萬元向米商請求買白米吃。</p>
<p>虹道　囤米問題</p>
<p>時隔不久，又閙了一件虹道女中囤米千担案，這件事情是被某維持秩序機關的負責人在深夜所發覺，後來經過報紙的揭載，虹道女中首先否認，說這是學生吃的食米，是包給一家店舖的。市政肘警察局調査結果，也謂不是事實。老百姓還是不能太相信，於是由市政府發起組織調査團，市參議會等團體機關都參加，時間已經過了大約有一星期，虹道女中的米並不多，從此許多團體機關做了報吿書，老百姓當然也可信賴得過。隨後又曾被警局抓蒞幾樁團米案和私運糧食案。但結果經糧食公會證明，係自產地購來運銷於本市的。</p>
<p>米價　狂跳形勢</p>
<p>最近一個月來，米價跳動得委實太厲害，由十萬元一担跳到十二萬元，由十二萬元跳到十五萬元，又由十五萬元跳到十八萬元二十萬元。現在杭州市的官價米還在十二萬七千元，自然相距甚遠。四天以前，杭州市府的田糧科負責人說：「本市存米計四行押款庫存一萬一千三百七十石，糧商登記存米八千另三十九石，中行十一萬石，共有十三萬石，足敷三月之需。」又據省田糧處長在省參大會上報告：「杭州再請糧食部撥售存糧，民食決無問題。」想不到四天以後，米的價格如此狂跳。市政府果然有堅强的決心，命令捕捉賣黑市的不法糧商，周市長也表示：必要時要吊銷糧商的營業執照，賣黑市的幾家米店，果然也有的被捕捉了，但米價的黑市依然高懸不墜，甚至在米店裏祗有配售的粗米，籮籃多陳粞糠空壳，如果有人要買，非向米商精商以最高的代價來購取黑市米不可。</p>
<p>理由　產地價貴</p>
<p>在杭州的報紙上，於是有這是糧商與市府鬥法的說法，實際上，據糧食公會理事長表示：「政府限價太低，成本都不够，無法營業，各店存米頂多只能維持一個禮拜。」又說：「商人是打來、駡來，蝕本不來。」現在一個先決的問題，即是到底存糧敷不敷目前的需要，假使據省市田糧負責人的說法，當然沒有問題的。而糧食公會的理事長也僅說「限價太低，成本都不够，無法營業。」所以「各店存米頂多只能維持一個禮拜。」如果限價提商，成本够了，那麽在有法營業之下，正可以維持一下呢？由此觀之，糧食公會的意思，是要把糧價提高，而其提高的理由仍爲產地價貴。據記者實地在硤有等處產地調査的結果，農村間在去年秋冬之交，早把大量米糧糶入米市，所剩已是無幾了。那麽這糧價的提高當然責任不在農民。同時杭市府田糧科負責人發表的杭市存米數字自然不是在今大一朝一夕所存的，而又據內幕人說產地價高是跟着市塲塲轉的，那麼今天糧價高漲的原因不難大白了。</p>
<p>市府　決定方案</p>
<p>糧價這樣的高漲，一切蔬菜油類都漲高了一倍，猪肉已經賣到五千六百元一斤。一般市民眞對這高物價覺得無限的戰悚。然而糧商們還是藉口成本過高，這樣地要政府加高糧價。現在就是要看政府有沒有辦法了。市政府方面聞已決定方案，其方案爲遍設糧食公賣店及設立向外採購機構。這個鄕法是將糧食變爲公營，使糧商營業完全凍結。又有一說仍請將四行存米每日撥一千石交各米店平糶。如果這兩個辦法實行後者，則將與黄金潮波及杭州市時的情形完全相同，無形中還是有黑市的賣買。如果這兩個辦法實行前者，那麽糧商無機可乘，自然會軟化下來，不過這全要看政府有沒有決心了。</p>
<p>糧食　公賣等等</p>
<p>不過糧食公賣店及設立向外採購機構不是不天之內可以一蹴而成的。也需要經過一段籌備的時間，營業員的招聘，店基的覓定，以及炎本額的確定，再者，如果有些不肖的米商眞的與政府鬥法，也像金子樣的用了許多戶頭來套購，可政府所控制的米也有究臺的日子，有些不肖的糧商還是可以抬起頭來，到那個時候，米商的身價可就不同了。</p>
<p>我覺得爲今之計，應該不單以調查黑市米爲得計，而應該嚴査囤積，如果査出了囤積，或將全數米糧充公，或以官價批價收購，甚至可以嚴辦幾個不肖的糧商，是比較澈底的辦法。否則關査黑市是調査不盡的，而且賣買黑市的人自有他的門檻，愈大的行號辦法愈多，力量愈大。</p>
<p>我們認爲米糧靑黄不接之時未到，杭州市存糧又豐富，是不應該閙米荒的。這個米荒的原因，前面旣已分析得很淸楚，那麽只看政府有沒有決心了，</p>

<h3>伏波艦案家屬來信</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>現在舉個例：</p>
<p>今天法院初審伏波海閩案時，戴儒林所請的魏文達律師出庭。當伏波艦大難生還的焦總孝輪機官講述被難經過時，曾提到在水上飄泊待救的大槪有六七十人，呼救聲慘不忍聞，此時律師忽問焦輪機官，「你怎麼知道是六七十人」？這意思就是想把伏波僅存的證人的話都要推翻，那麽戴儒林的官司不用打，自然是勝訴。</p>
<p>魏律師當庭詰責駡海閩旅客鄭桂仁君作證的話完全無據，實屬武斷。</p>
<p>當海閩二副吳侃申述撞船經過時，魏律師竟說吳二副的話也不對，並且替吳二副說出許多理由，難道在陸上的魏律師能比吳二副親身經過的事實更豐當更具體嗎？法官的眼睛明亮的很，只說了一句「我在問他，沒有問你」。於是魏律師無味的坐下來。</p>
<p>初審只是調査庭，照理用不到辯論的，魏大律師爲要對被吿表示格外賣力，竟把我們是被難家屬的理由完全駁去，謹把旁聽的經過，公諸社會，請社會公評。（伏波艦被難家屬王杭曼筠，朱蔡秀章，陳成莉俠）四月廿九日</p>

<h3>猶太復國運動</h3>
<p>— 觀周</p>
<p>最近報端常常可以看到巴勒斯坦的紛糾，這就是猶太民族的復國問題。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦位在地中海東岸的南部，北界叙利亞，南連埃及的西奈半島，東部和外約坦毘連，面積約一〇·四三〇方哩，居民一·四五〇·〇〇〇人，它是耶回猶三大宗敎的聖地。</p>
<p>編元前猶太人在此建立國家，至紀元七十年羅嗎大將狄杜斯攻下耶路撤冷以後，猶太人被逐出境，在十九世紀末，猶太人赫次爾博士曾提倡猶太人復國運動，但沒有成功。</p>
<p>說到這次復國的紛糾，其遠因在第一次世界大戰時形成，原來在那次戰爭時，英國為着要利用阿拉伯人，曾答應戰後阿拉伯可獲得在巴勒斯坦建國的自由；但同時要拉攏全世界的猶太人，希望他們也帮助協約國，在著名的巴爾福（Balfaur）外長宣言中曾說：「英國泉家政府贊同在巴勒斯坦建立猶太人的國家，英國政府盡力仲成此舉之成功，」這樣雙重諾言，自然是會發生紛糾的。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰後，杜魯門總統，鑒於猶太人被納粹殺戮虐待，顚沛流離，戰後飄泊在外的猶太人有五六十萬，於是帮助他們回到巴勒斯坦去復國，並給種種援助，因此就與勒斯坦原是猶太人祖先希伯來人的故國，聖經上曾有詳細的記載，在目下猶太人雖不及阿拉伯人的多，質的方面，猶太人遠較阿拉伯人爲優。他們運用了手頭鉅大的資金，用科學方法，創立了許多大企業，敎育方面，工程方面，都有極大的成就。那裏有兩個重要的城市，呌作台爾河維及海發，都已成了純粹的猶太化城市。肥沃的土地，被猶太人收買去了，繁盛的城市，被猶太人住滿了，當然要遭受阿拉伯人的疾視。英人也放心不下，用武力壓制。不過在美國，不但杜魯門總統帮忙，就是興論也贊成猶太復國，去年曾舉行過一次民意測騐，受測騐者有百分之七十八認爲應當復國的，百分之十四反對，其餘的沒有意見，所以去年八月裏大陸報的社評上勸英人不要用武力，若使用强制手段是使寗死不屈的猶太人更加團結奮鬥。</p>
<p>廿七年前，國父也曾支持猶太人的復國運動，他在寫給上海猶太人辦的月刋呌作「以色列通訊」（Israel's　Messenger）雜誌的一信中說：「余對此項復國運動，極表同情，此爲現代最重要運動之一，凡愛好民主人仕均盡心盡勞援助你們此種恢復歷史上古國之運動。」</p>
<p>「在血和火中，猶太國將再生！」這是猶太秘密軍哈格那所唱的歌。哈氏目下擁有七萬左右的隊員，在中東活動，他們在聖地重建祖國，當不難如願以償的。</p>

<h3>顧青瑤女畫家訪問記</h3>
<p>— 聶光坻</p>
<p>藝苑作負，於今為盛，而以詩書畫個別三絕者，閩秀中尤為難得。宿慕吳郡順青瑤女士畫譽，昨始因友人之介，偕訪其寓。時女士正坦首作賓，室中几案皆箋素「壁懸古琴三，意女士尚躭琴讚者。承示近作數幀，皆清寄古澹，工逸兼至；風格旣高逸。氣局精宏，筆剛健而墨蒼渾，蓋得力於大滌新羅之融冶，參之以宋元，逈非時流所可同語也。其自題山水畫云：「閉門詩癖狂猶昔，老去丹靑墨漸蒼，僵捥不爲當世屈，獨高眞節拜淸湘」。又自題仿石濤山水云：「欲取焦桐彈，奇峯四面冷，香草隱薛蘿，古木長瘤　，山鬼方萬車，松花落雲頂；日暮楚客心，招魂誰爲醒。」</p>
<p>女士語余：此數幀亦作以應女子書畫會出品者．余索觀其詩詞稿有最近爲陸鳴岡題花遲好齋盟書圖金樓曲云：「烽火輛漫日，有翛然，放翁孤憤，潔身憂國，結習唯耽書與畫，顚米癡黄並惜；又豈料烟雲罹刦，不减冬花庵抱恨，歎摩挲，十載傷灰滅；嗟一炬。熖何烈。</p>
<p>珊瑚鐵網重收拾，戞琳琅，冷金題錦，絳綃籠壁；箋素長存淸白志，慣愛梅横石坼；道依舊，墨香盈室；從此嫏嬛千萬軸，儘花遲，好視如圭璧，眞嗜者，與同癖。」佘嘗觀其及門弟子之作品，察其樹石筆法，皆合畫理，頗詫爲不易。今晤女士，方知授受之功有自焉。</p>
<p>友人語余謂女士畫品尤高。余曰；固然，已於所讀詩詞中稔之矣。丁茲末世，不意尙有貞介之風如女士者；人以畫傳，畫以品高，唯女士能當之無愧矣。</p>
<h3>雨天</h3>
<p>— 藍蕙</p>
<p>幾天太陽，剛剛晒得人暖洋洋地有點慵懶了；今早忽然又濛濛地下起雨來。行走在雨里，抑止不住一種親切之感。</p>
<p>住在鄉下的時候，我有一件特殊的興趣：最愛在雨天的早晨，赤足打傘。低頭漫步於被雨水洗得極其素凈的石板路上，或者滑行於泥濘的田坎邊；一面看着自己底雙脚被浸泡得十分潔白，或者被塗滿黄泥，一面靜聽着雨珠敲着傘面的聲音，於是自己覺得一種無可比喩的輕鬆與愉快。此時腦中淸新如洗，平日里一切煩人的雜念恍然若失；而常常，久想不得的文思和詩句便如淸溪一般，汨汨流出了。</p>
<p>我記下了那些自然而來的純眞的詩司，我也把那淸晨田野間的雨景作為我最好的紀憶里的一部份。</p>
<p>春天的雨呼喚看土內綠色的生機。有誰在一夜春雨之後的次晨，拜訪過春天的田野的麼？看那些從土里掙出身子來，充溢着感謝之情，輕輕地顫抖着捧帶着水珠的綠苗，難道你能拒絕那種生長的喜蛻麽？</p>
<p>夏天的雨表現了生命力的强烈：它來得粗暴突元，去得斬釘截鐵。那奇偉的美使你同時覺得又驚懼又歡喜：它使人想起雨後的晴空，和天邊的彩虹。</p>
<p>而幽怨和思念伴躋秋天的雨簾。茫茫的，淡淡的，彷彿無涯無際際的秋雨，勾引着無覊的遐想，給深情的相思者以不盡的滋味。</p>
<p>自然冬天的雨令人愁苦。然而，墊伏的小蟲不正爲春天在養精蓄說？愁苦的冬雨何嘗不在哭泣冬天將盡的壽命？……</p>
<p>今年春天來得遲——不，是冬天留戀着去得晚；在該是春天的日子里仍然哭泣着冬雨。但，我們爲什麽要絕望，甚至懷疑春天會不會來呢，看，那牆角的枯草不是已暗暗地換上了顏色了麽？……。</p>

<h3>松葉</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>在『抱朴子『裏，有這樣一段記載：</p>
<p>『漢成帝時，獵者於終南山中見一人，無衣服，身生黑毛，獵人見之，欲逐取之，而其人踰坑越谷，有如飛騰，不可遠及。於是乃密伺候其所在，合圍得之，乃是婦人。問之，言我本是秦之宮人也，聞關東賊至，秦王出降，宮室燒燔，驚走人山，飢無所食，垂餓死，有一老翁，教我食松葉松實，當時苦澀，後稍便之，遂使不飢不渴，冬不寒，夏不熱。計此女是秦王子嬰宮人，至成帝之世，三百許歲。乃將歸以穀食之，初聞穀臭嘔吐，累日乃安。如是二年許，身毛乃脫落，轉老而死，向使不爲人所得，便成仙人矣。」</p>
<p>看了這段「神話』，使我想起了一樁我所經過的事實。</p>
<p>三十二年春，蘇北經敵人大規模的掃　，我暫避在一個水蕩畔，被亂兵連刦數次，衣物喪失殆盡，僅餘單掛袴一身，穿越敵區，渡江到皖南；但不數日，敵騎又至，我因爲人地生疏，無處可以容身，就向山叢間找覓藏所。</p>
<p>描寫皖南的地形，本來有『地無三尺平』的設法。一入山地，大有山石能碰痛你鼻子的可能。只見前後左右都是連綿的山巒和高崗，好像是山之神，故意佈防的「山陣」，使投進去的人們永遠脫逃不出來一樣。</p>
<p>當時，我找到了一個山谷，利用四圍的山石，做我護身的外壳；但上面還露着一綫天空，我就把一件褂子脫下，四角　在樹枝上，這樣想能遮斷這個恐怖的世界。</p>
<p>可是事實上，恐怖仍舊緊跟着槍砲彈而襲來。</p>
<p>尖銳的子彈聲，和笨重的砲彈聲，牠們交錯地在我頭項飛過，我的身子雖然禁不住在發抖，但還能勉强控制住自己的兩條腿，不使離開這個山谷，而向別處跑去。</p>
<p>『假使我命裏註定要死，那末這兒的山谷，正是一個天然的棺槨』。</p>
<p>我這樣地想着，想着，非常痛苦地，一秒鐘一秒鐘地挨過去。</p>
<p>從正午一直到夜晚，槍砲聲漸漸地沉寂下來，可是另一種嚴重的脅迫，開始加到我身上。——那就是飢餓。</p>
<p>夜風帶來了遠戲的驚啼聲。我知道，在山叢中，一定躱藏着不少的受難的人們，人家同樣地在受難，我又到何處去覓食呢？沒得辦法，我只有在身邊的松樹上找尋現成的『食料』了。一把把的松葉，一連地送進我的口中，起初覺得有些苦，但後來覺得又香又甜。</p>
<p>戰事繼續了五天。我吃了五天的松葉。身邊所有的松葉，差不多都給我採盡了。到了第六天，大自然仍舊恢復了原來的平靜，敵人退去了。我從山谷裏爬起來，只覺頭暈眼花，辨別不淸方向。探望遠處，見有人倚在石旁，於是很快地走上前去，預備探問道路，誰知就近一看，願來是一具死屍。他的臉色慘白，地上有一灘鮮血，這大概是爲流彈所擊斃的。再向前走了幾步，又見樹旁躺着一人，細察之，原來也是一具死屍，但這具屍身上沒有傷痕，地上也見不到血跡，猜想這恐怕是在驚嚇與飢餓的雙重侵襲下而致死的吧？我對了這具屍首，一方面悲哀，一方面也不禁深自慶幸，慶幸着在這五天裏全靠松葉，纔能活命；否則的話，將和面前的屍首作同伴了。</p>
<p>抱朴子說吃松松實，可以『成仙一，那末我吃了五天的松葉，雖未成仙，但也已經探到『仙人』的途徑了。</p>
<h3>周愚山書法箇展</h3>
<p>— 楊中一</p>
<p>求古齋主人周愚山君在大新公司舉行書法箇展，承周君之招前往參觀，陳列作品不下百餘件，琳琅滿目，美不勝收。各種書法之中，以篆體居多，而綜觀其篆體之變格，更以鐵綫篆一種爲最得其神髓。蓋鐵綫篆頗不易作，非有精細之心思，必不能合於矩矱，周君書武侯前後出師表兩巨幅，字數甚多，筆畫甚勻，細入秋毫，密如蛛網，　瞻近覽，皆朗若織錦之紋，筆工腕力歎觀止矣。其餘篆體如助虛甲骨，周毛公鼎之對聯，爲數亦不少。此外尙有十年前之舊作八幅，一，夏禹岣嶁碑，二，殷虛甲骨文，三，周毛公鼎，四，會稽山石刻文，五，漢開毋廟興始神道石闕文，六，魏正始三體石經，七，吳天發神議三段殘碑，八，唐李陽冰城隍廟文，八輻自夏迄唐，頗含歷史性意義，已於民國二十五年全國名人書畫展覧會中列入優等。夫禹碑藏於衡嶽，篆體特殊，字難辨識；從來訓釋雖有三家，然因字之可疑者甚多。亦鮮爲人所臨摹，以其用筆作風逈不與諸篆體同也。余謂周君之鐵綫篆秀拔譬如歐陽詢字，禹碑之雄壯譬如顏魯公字，兩體各有其神妙之處。</p>
<p>又見一幅正行相間，錯落而頗具美化者，皆集顏體字，是可謂周君能以顏字之神，慕禹碑之形，當然形神具到矣。雖其甲有幾幅字體稍嫌瘦削，此或因碑本之不同歟？倘若近作必視十年之前，則更逼肖矣。近來書聯集甲骨文者漸多，大都筆畫如刀削，蓋當時刻字於甲骨之上，起迄有鋒，不必兩端平勻，如鐵綫篆然，蓋鐵綫篆如鐵絲，甲骨文如竹絲，筆　剛柔之間，作風各異。八幅之中，以三體石經兩端過尖，而中間似嫌稍闊，因此遂陷於軟弱無力，宛芳蘭葉體矣。余每謂薛尙功鐘鼎不若阮元之鐘鼎者，亦正因薛體兩端皆尖，而阮體不尖，恰如當日靑銅器上所鐫之篆文也，茲就管見質之專家，以爲如何？</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「貴部？」鶴見閒閒的着手盤問了。</p>
<p>「第十一大隊，第二分隊，第三小隊，一等勤務。」說着又站起來立正行禮，却被見把他按了一把，讓他坐下：</p>
<p>「今晨到碼頭去迎候中村小姐，想必是貴上司佈置的？」</p>
<p>「是，昨晚大使館有　來，…勤務不大淸楚…據說應該由軍部招待，因華北的還種服務，是由軍部直接辦理。但今晨迎接二位老爺，倒沒有華北的直接通知，是由御當職老爺，電知大使館的…這才田大使…」</p>
<p>「明白了。」鶴見嫌這人過於囉嗦，「那們說，萬歲館的安置，也是由軍部指定的了？」</p>
<p>「勤務不大明白…」那勤務想了一想「…但據情形說，恐是大使館指定的。」</p>
<p>「何以見得？」</p>
<p>「軍部招待各方各部各級長官，向來不用萬歲館。」</p>
<p>「噢，」鶴見因時間關係，不願再扯上旁枝問題了，「有一件事，想必你還能記得，—早晨我聞中村小姐上車，有一個衣服破爛少年，在車旁藏着，大約你看見了？」</p>
<p>「哦……，」那勤務想了一想，似乎早晨的事，他有些記不淸了，「…是的，…記得了：是有一個乞丐；上海這裏，這一類乞丐很多很多。簡直職業化了：各地停車塲，或臨時停車所在，就有這一類的乞丐，自動來替人看管汽車，是要討些賞錢。同時他們又是職業州小偸，假使不讓他們看管，或不給賞錢，他們必要把車上東西偸些去，或把車子毁損一些…」</p>
<p>「明白了，」鶴見又把這家伙的報吿截斷了，「你當時可聽見那之丐說話？」</p>
<p>「…似乎聽見，…不敢說一定…也許當時認爲他在討賞，所以不大留心。」</p>
<p>「很好，」這二字是鷄見的常用口語，不一定按照平常涵使用，「你可留心那乞丐的來去時間和踪跡？…」</p>
<p>「這個問題…！」動務見鶴見的問話一步一步，逐漸加緊，方才發覺他在受着盤問，本身是嫌疑地位了，便一面答話，一面離開座位，筆直地站在一邊，「…關於這個乞丐，勤務當時確是沒有注意，因上海這個地方，這一類的事太多了。不過，勤務失察的過錯是免不了的…！」這勤務很明白事理，並且也會說話。</p>
<p>「請坐下龍，」鶴見感覺不安：他的原意，本想從「閑談」方式，交出那勤務的眞話，但一時過分操切，把問話的步驟，詞句，弄的溢出了原擬範圍，有些成功僵局了，所以仍態要那勤務坐下說話，意圖緩和些空氣。「請你明瞭，我並非盤問你什麼嫌疑，…原因爲了意外發生了不英的事態，我們疑心到那乞丐身上，所以請你來談談。對於你身上，我們並無疑問。…」</p>
<p>「勤務很明瞭，」那勤務並沒有坐下，「勤務似乎記得，當時那個乞丐，在二位老爺未上車前，勤務　有留意，也沒有看見。等到話見，已經是開車前一雲，也沒有當他一回事…這是眞　！」</p>

<p>當然我們不知道應該天眞爛漫的孩子爲什麽對人生也會如此絕望，而且絕望之後，會這樣決絕的奔赴死去。這不能當做一個消極的態度看的，我們的孩子們在死的前面也無所畏懼，是能够有所作爲，是着有志氣的。</p>
<p>試想一個十七歲的男孩予能够去向　局租一圖言箱代購書報，博取佣金以維生計。試想一個十五歲的女孩子，想不賴家庭來偸錢繼續求學。這種求生的精神實在是可歌可泣的</p>
<p>日特露德這個盲女孩子復明以後在紀德的回筆下曾經爲了看到這醜惡的世界而絕望自殺，她究竟還沒有眞正摸到現實的硬度，然而已够令我們掩卷太息。朱愛波，這稚幼的女孩子，她是眞正從實生活中走過來的，她的自殺，無異是最響亮的對現社會的控訴。</p>
<p>無論時日發展得那樣壞，千萬別將這樣悲慘的結果臨到我們的孩子們的身上吧。如果我們的社會連孩子們都感到沒有一條生路，那是眞的沒有一條生路可以走了。</p>
<p>請你聽，像朱愛波這樣的女孩子也會悲哀地說：「活在現在這樹社會，多沒有意思呀。」這是比一千萬構論文還有分析與硏究的價値。</p>
<p>願我們的社會還有一綫光亮照着朱愛波這樣的孩子活下去！</p>
<h3>墨子與孔子</h3>
<p>— 樟生</p>
<p>假使我生在淸代以前的朝代，那當然不敢批評孔子，也不會常提着墨子。孔子的學說是不許當時人士加以批評，墨子的思想是不爲當時文人所提倡。故當時孔子門庭若市，其名遠震四海；而墨子却門可羅雀，十里外無其名矣！現在舉例二則如左：</p>
<p>（一）墨子止楚攻宋</p>
<p>戰國時，楚稱雄得隴望蜀欲攻宋。墨子聞之，星夜至楚，見楚王請打消原意，然其臣公輸般不服，與之　戰許久，最後，公輸般敗允停止攻宋，故宋人民皆免遭災。</p>
<p>（二）「對夫子不敬」</p>
<p>周國時代，某日，某　軍與其隨員同謁孔子，進門時二人俱躬身而行，其隨員偶然抬頭，次日即革職，罪狀爲「對夫子不敬」。</p>
<p>看了上面兩役短短的故事，可以知道他兩人的思想，墨子是和平處世；孔子是「唯君是從」</p>
<p>墨子主張十兼愛非攻，更提倡活讀書—動的硏究和白動的觀察—在以前他所硏究的科學，如天文，教學等，現在都實現了，可見他當時並不一竅不通地胡幹，而是在思想上有根據的硏究。</p>
<p>孔子則主張「君要臣死，不得不死；父要子亡，不得不亡」的忠孝學說，他祇提捐妄從的忠孝”而我們現在應該先辦是非專效國爭雙親。他認爲文的讀書爲功名；武的敏死沙塲爲數祖，如果眞的這樣，那現在的學生求學，兵士打仗都失了眞正的意義了。</p>
<h3>怎樣聽交響樂？</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>「交響樂」（Symphcny）是音樂藝術上意識與技術均臻最上乘的結晶，因此非具有相當的欣賞能力，是不容易聽懂的。我國欣賞音樂的水準，一般比較低落，除了少數「知音者」外，大多數人聽交響樂底演奏，感覺一知半解，或茫然不知所云。</p>
<p>要了解一首交響樂的內容，判斷演奏成績的優劣，和領會欣賞的樂趣，必須且備各方面的知識：</p>
<p>關於演奏的方式，必須了解各種樂器的種頫，音色，個別的功能，和特殊的表情力等等。如小提琴的音色華麗多情，優柔美感；大提琴的　色深沉熱情；管的音色質樸傷態，富於田園風味；銅角的音色莊嚴沉雄，且有悲凉之感。……</p>
<p>關於樂曲的形式，必須了解曲體。雖然欣賞者不必是一個音樂家，但至少要憔得交響樂的形式：它是由管絃樂隊（Orchestra）演奏的鉅型樂曲，全曲通常包含三或四　樂章（Moveinent）：第一樂章用快板奏鳴曲體，第二樂章用慢板三段體或變奏曲，第三樂章用小快板小步舞曲（Mtnnt）或詼諧曲（大三段體），第四樂軍用快板迴旋曲體。</p>
<p>關於作曲家的個性與風格，必須對音樂史有相當認赦，並有聽覺底辨別力。如聽貝多芬的「英雄交響樂」（第三）時，除了領會那種莊宏的氣魄外，對於作曲者的政治見解與民主思想，以及作曲動機，均須了解。又如聽他底「命運交響樂」（第五）時，除了領會那種暗示與「命運」若鬧終勝利的情緒外，還得了解作曲者底動機與希望。</p>
<p>關於音樂的種類和派別，必須知道大槪的輪廓，如「主調音樂」與「複調音樂」的區別：前者是「和聲」（Harmony）襯托的美，後者是「對位」（Counterpoint）交織的美。「絕對音樂」與「標題音樂」的不同；前者表現抽象，內容形式不分；後者有特定標題指示內容，或寫情，或抒情。再如音樂上的兩大流派——古典派與浪漫派——的作風，特長及代表人物等等，亦應略知其梗槪。</p>
<p>假若你具備了上述的幾種知識，便已有了相當的欣賞能力，當然可從聆聽交響樂底演奏中，獲得了不少崇高的樂趣。至於要想做一個出色的音樂評論家的話，則更須在演奏前先從事樂曲整個內容的一番硏究功夫了。</p>
<h3>監獄客滿</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>據報載；一度因大數令而人頭稀少的監獄，如今又吿客滿了，其中犯案累累的好漢很不少。</p>
<p>說句不通而通的話，監獄原是犯案者的歸宿；赦出監獄，又徬徨街頭，於是，「復員」重理舊業，因而被抓，重進監獄。</p>
<p>或曰：「這班人不務正業，坐監不算事，於國家社曾有害無益，槍斃了就行了。一但這怕難行吧。况且於國家社會有害的，不僅是這些人呢！</p>
<h3>僞滿國歌</h3>
<p>— 白衣</p>
<p>「九一八」事變後，日寇利用遜淸廢帝溥儀，在我東北設立僞滿洲國，傀儡登塲，醜態百出。昨有客謂余言：僞滿成立後，亦曾編製所謂「國歌」强迫東北同胞歌唱。詞意荒謬絕倫，文亦不通，不知爲誰所作。其歌云：「天地內，有了新滿洲。新滿洲，便是新天地；順天立地，無苦無憂。造成我國家，只有親愛，並無怨仇。人民三千萬，縱加工倍，也得自由。重禮義，尙仁議，自我身修。家已齊，國已治，此外何求？近之則與世界同化，遠之則納天地同荒！」其時東北學生，莫不以溥儀　離祖國，　　事敵，爲我中華之奇恥大辱，故有人曾將僞國歌改爲：「天地內，有了大饅頭；大饅頭，拿去喂狗！滿天滿地，　苦盡辛！造成這國家，並無親愛，只有怨仇！人民三合拌（謂僞滿境內，中國，日本，朝鮮三國人民雜居其間）蹤加十倍，也不自由！那禮義，與仁讓，誰人還修！家不齊，國不治，幾時抬頭？近之與高麗同化，遠之則與猶太一流！」一時家喩戶曉，到處傳唱，可見當時關外同胞，對於僞滿眞相，充分認識，惜處於敵人鐵時下，不能有所作爲。</p>
<h3>外交名詞新解</h3>
<p>— 米喜林</p>
<p>「外交官」一詞，英文爲Dipeomad從外交史上考據，原來自羅馬，當時外交官並不像今日的受人羨慕，尤其在生活方面，限制頗嚴，約束甚多。</p>
<p>外交一事，本多屬於國家機密，不可洩露，故當時歐洲的外交官，一律不得帶妻子上任，以防機密之定露消息，這樣却苦了一般欽差大人。所以政府為了獎勵洋務官，除了衣錦厚祿之外。還准携滯庖人（Cook）以物質上的享受補此精神缺憾，但是誰願意拋棄家室，出走異域呢？所以西洋史家把當時的「外交官」以公式表之：即</p>
<p>D是外交官Dipeomad　C是廚子Cook　W是太太Wife。</p>
<p>時至今日，外交官帶夫人參加宴會，已成爲國際外交禮節，但是携帶「庖人」者，則反見滅少。所以今日之西洋史家皆謂，以上之公式應改爲D　W　　C華</p>
<h3>芳齡難知</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>甲男：你的新女友芳齡多少了？</p>
<p>乙男：她說她曾度三十二個夏天！可是後來我聽人說，她的大半世都是在北極度過的。</p>
<h3>多事之秋</h3>
<p>— 將菊舲</p>
<p>朋友對君近來接到許多請柬，不是「家母五十壽展」，便是「小大彌月之喜」，我說他口福大，在「撥冗光臨」之際，不是可以「大嚼一頓」麽？</p>
<p>可是他說這些主人都在鬧着「鈔票荒」而出此下策的，我才恍然大悟，不緊相對莞　。我說這是「春天裏的秋風」，朋友說這年頭眞是「多事之秋」。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>他有着綏靖長官公署主任秘書的介紹書，信封上還經X司令長官以龍蛇飛舞的筆致批着兩行墨黑的大字；而且第一次來，他就見到過那位態處長了，人家對他非常客氣，一些架子也沒有，然而車子刧還是不能到手！這倒不是那位熊處長故意跟　作難，而是來要車子的人實在太多了，每個人都有極大的來頭，甚至他們自已就是有大財大勢的人，拿出來的名片，在平時是足以　製這一位僅僅比照上校支　的交通處長而有餘的。他們都可以不待邀請，　即自己　進　長室去，或者隨手遞過）件公事，　面　　對方批覆，這當然都是老祝所不　做的於是他祇能一次一次的等下去了。</p>
<p>今天，他覺得無論如何不能再忍耐了，他下了破釜沉舟的決心，準備向那位權傾一時的熊處長要一個或是或否的肯定的答覆。</p>
<p>客人漸漸走庶了，左　那間大辦公　裏的小職員也都開始敎出去吃飯了；老祝認定這是一個機會，便突然推開了通往處長室的小門，滿面春風池走這云。</p>
<p>熊處長根本已記不得他了，用着困惑的　光抬起頭來。</p>
<p>「對不起！熊處長，我是新　　劃團的祝兆年。就爲車子的事！」老祝先開口。</p>
<p>「……」辦公桌上的人顯出了不　煩的神氣。</p>
<p>「是X司令長官已經批准的。上次我們也談過了！」老说忙着再找補兩句，一面就在旁邊一張小椅上坐了下去。</p>
<p>對方的臉色這才鬆動了一些。</p>
<p>「我們已經等候……」</p>
<p>辦公桌上的電話鈴種了，熊處長的耳朵又給別人搶走了。老祝祗這　住了未脫的話，愕愕地等着。這一次的電話偏是特別的冗長，熊電長雖然三番兩次向對方說了「再見」和「回頭一定辦好」這一類的話，但對方運是刺刺不休，老祝怒視着那條黑油油的電話綫，眞想一下把它揪斷。</p>
<p>「這差使眞當不了！他媽的！」年少氣盛的熊處長憤然擲下了電話筒，怒氣冲冲地說。</p>
<p>這對老視太不利了！他想這　候再跟對方談自己則事，那眞是硬碰釘子。然而不談又不成。（六一）</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] At 10:10 AM on the 2nd, the National Army recaptured Suide County. The advancing troops led by Hu Zongnan approached the city on the night of the 30th and immediately launched a fierce encirclement and attack on the communist troops entrenched within the city. The communist troops initially resisted stubbornly, hoping to defend their last important stronghold in northern Shaanxi. After a fierce battle lasting a full day and night, the National Army valiantly annihilated them, inflicting heavy casualties. The communist troops were finally breached on the morning of the 2nd. The remaining communist troops had no will to fight and fled in all directions. The National Army completely recaptured the city at 10:10 AM, and is now appeasing the people in the suburbs and dispatching teams to pursue the enemy northeastward.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 2nd] The Jinan battle has completely entered the stage of contention for ferry crossings.

<h3>A Certain Observer Speaks: The Chinese Communists Have Abandoned Legal Competition; Hidden Party Members Are Launching Revolts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Chinese Communists are conspiring to launch a full-scale armed rebellion and have secretly promulgated the "Guidelines for Underground Struggle." This reporter specially visited a certain political observer to inquire about his views and published his understanding of the "Guidelines for Underground Struggle" of the Chinese Communists. His comments are as follows: (1) The entire Chinese Communist Party has completely abandoned the peaceful and legal means of competition and has turned to the path of full-scale armed rebellion. The entire party has become a military rebellion group and has lost its status as a political party. (2) The hidden organizations of the Chinese Communists in various parts of the rear area are all bandit organizations for "civilian uprisings" and "rebellions." Their hidden party members are all rebels and military spies. (3) The Democratic League, which has always claimed to be "independent," "peaceful," and "legal," and its incarnations, such as the Democratic National Construction Association, the Democratic Promotion Association, and the Three Principles of the People Comrades Association, are actually controlled by the Chinese Communists, and their actions are all carried out according to the wishes of the Chinese Communists. (4) The "Democratic United Front," which the Democratic League is currently in the process of forming, is also "preparing to be a new tool of rebellion for the Chinese Communists under the orders of the Central Committee." (5) The Chinese Communists are secretly sending people to infiltrate and lurk in various social organizations and parties throughout the country, especially the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, to carry out rumors, so-called "incitement," and divisive tactics, conspiring to divide the strength of the various parties and create internal strife. (6) The Chinese Communists will strengthen the sabotage of railway tracks, important bridges, and attacks on stations and telecommunications agencies in the rear area. (7) The Chinese Communists are actively unifying rural bandits and armed forces, attempting to integrate them into a whole, expand disturbances, and endanger the rear area.</p>

<h3>Zhu Shizheng Surrenders; Expresses Regret for the "Tianlu Incident" in Xikang Province; Reports the Circumstances of Being Instructed by Others</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Ya'an, 1st] Zhu Shizheng and Li Yuanheng, who previously presided over the "Tianlu Incident" in Xikang Province, were moved by the government's leniency and voluntarily came to Ya'an to surrender themselves to the authorities, willing to abide by the law. They also submitted a letter of repentance to Chairman Liu Wenhui, stating that they were exploited and their reckless actions. The original text is as follows: "Last winter, a Mr. Xu, dressed in a yellow wool military uniform, suddenly came to the township to negotiate, claiming to be under the order of a certain senior official, specially coming to help the people of Xikang to relieve their suffering. The ambitious people of Xikang should rise up and provide firearms, ammunition, and food, and he was willing to command the troops in the team. He also urged the establishment of a Political Reform Committee. He also claimed that someone was working in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to provide support, and that this was a case of internal and external coordination, and that military and political operations would be carried out in coordination, which would surely be successful, etc. Therefore, we did not consider it carefully, and always thought that the background was very strong. As long as an incident was launched, the goal could be achieved. Unexpectedly, a moment of impulsiveness was misled, and we did not know that the situation was getting worse and worse, which caused a great disaster to the local area, which was not expected by us. All because of limited knowledge, being instructed by others, made a big mistake, which is too late to regret."</p>

<h3>The CCP Establishes a Struggle Plan, Attempting a Full-Scale Armed Uprising; Secret Documents of the Communists Discovered in Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] After rejecting peace talks and withdrawing its delegations stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Yu, the CCP, in preparation for new conspiracy struggles in government areas, instructed its hidden party members to instigate its peripheral organizations to launch a full-scale armed uprising. It is reported that Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhang Wentian, and others went to Wayao Fort on February 11 to convene an expanded Political Bureau meeting, presided over by Mao Zedong, who proposed a plan for underground struggle. The plan was approved and issued on March 12, signed by Mao Zedong, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Ye Jianying, and Peng Dehuai. The full text of the general program for this underground struggle has recently been obtained in the Northern Shaanxi area. It is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Launch Popular Uprisings and Strikes</p>
<p>Political Aspects: (1) Reduce the size of the party's work committees in various regions and prepare for new struggles through extremely secret groups, launching popular uprisings, strikes, anti-violence, and rent resistance action struggles. (2) Unite progressive social groups and free individuals, fellow travelers, and connect with workers and peasants, especially poor and hired farmers, and poor people in rural areas, and their representative forces, in a non-neutral stance, to form a united front for democracy, patriotism, anti-dictatorship, and anti-civil war. (3) Use the four mainstays of the Democratic League, the Democratic National Construction Association, the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, and the Association for Promoting Democracy as a call to action, and in industrial centers, absorb the masses and neutral entrepreneurs as a solid foundation for initial victories. (4) Regional committees and core organizational units at all levels must prepare especially carefully, using every opportunity to mobilize the Democratic League and the action factions of the Farmers' and Workers' Democratic Party, especially for action factions and the various organizations of the Three People's Principles factions, establish closer ties. Standing committees and cores in various regions regularly send representatives to attend meetings of cadres from the Democratic League, the Three Associations, and the action factions in various regions, and report the situation of their various meetings and individual actions to the Central Bureau through couriers, as a review of the allocation of forces. (5) Utilize the upper-level relationships of the Association for Promoting Democracy and the Democratic National Construction Association in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Chongqing to help expand the party's transportation network so that party announcements can be quickly transmitted to various regions, but this must be done with the condition of protecting one's own secrets. (6) The Political Bureau must dispatch special envoys to preside over the allocation of various action tasks in various regions and special zones, or be directed by the bureau committee of the branch bureau. At the same time, regional committees and special zone committees must regularly (at least once a month) send representatives to the central area to attend meetings and must achieve close contact between the central area, local areas, and special zones. Regarding the use of letters, instructions, announcements, telegrams, and all methods used by special envoys dispatched by the Central Bureau in the future, direct (A) couriers will notify them at any time, and communication networks must be used to the greatest extent possible. Local relationships must be used to enable the party's local area leading comrades to quickly and thoroughly know the events that are maturing between them, so that local areas can prepare for new struggles. (7) The strategy of isolating compromise factions and rebel factions, dividing and absorbing their lower-level cadres, plays a very important role in the new struggle. In the three regions of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, and in the various industrial centers, it is especially necessary to strengthen its application, and to quickly form propaganda groups to go to various parties and "Minxiao" (referring to the Kuomintang and the government), various institutions, among workers, in yellow unions, especially in various transportation agencies, to spread terror messages and the policies of our party. Propagandists in various regions must be periodically transferred to receive new and strict training (limited to party members) to strengthen the application of new policies. (8) Under the current situation, "Minxiao" is unlikely to take high-pressure tactics against the leaders of the Democratic League, and they should make full use of their local resources and the potential of social relationships in various regions to specifically prevent the great unity of the reactionary side and the approach of the middle factions to "Minxiao." In a positive aspect, it is to absorb their cadres and seize leadership, highly develop our core and the deepening of our policies. In action, we must accommodate, tolerate, and strive for consistency with the various intermediate factions of the Democratic League, create a unified policy alliance, and further promote the great unity of democratic factions and intermediate factions nationwide, to form a national alliance to overthrow the ruling power of the four major families. The principle of this great unity, great alliance, and general mobilization is anti-Chiang and peaceful reunification. This kind of democratic great unity can achieve initial victories, which will reduce the difficulties for the revolutionary proletariat and other laborers in establishing democratic unity. (9) The party's propaganda groups and core, through "Minxiao," the Social Democratic Party, and the Youth League, should take united action inside and outside to seize their lower-level cadres and divide their organizations, so that many of their ordinary party members abandon their trust in their leaders and promote their participation in the policies of the Democratic League, the Three Associations, and the Democratic National Construction Association. This is the joint bridge of the people's revolution that can be created in the new struggle, and it is also one of the key and main tasks of the nationwide anti-four major families.</p>
<p>Establish Guerrilla Corps</p>
<p>Military Aspects: (1) Unify local armed forces, organize and establish a Guerrilla Corps Headquarters, expand popular uprisings, and armed uprisings, so that the "Minxiao Bandit Army" disperses its forces and increases its defense. (2) All local armed organizations, armed work teams, militia self-defense forces, worker-peasant armed teams, and guerrilla commando teams shall operate under the unified command of the Guerrilla Corps Headquarters. (3) In the "Minxiao" areas, quickly establish armed popular uprising commands in various villages and towns. Each department and branch should allocate forces and formulate plans, using armed work teams, commando battalions, and snipers to occupy decisive locations in response to popular uprisings. However, before launching an uprising, it is necessary to pay meticulous attention to collecting information from all aspects of the people about the actions, components, and deployments of the "White Bandit" troops stationed in the area, and their atrocities against the people. If this kind of arrangement is not made, it will become a laughable stupidity. We absolutely do not want beautiful resolutions or actions without certainty. (4) For ordinary armed popular uprising actions in the "Minxiao" areas, proceed according to the following resolutions of the Central Political Bureau and the Revolutionary Military Commission: (A) No matter when or where, do not treat armed popular uprisings as child's play. Avoid repeating the erroneous lines of the past "Autumn Harvest Uprising" and "National Urban Uprising," but know that from the beginning of the uprising, it must be carried out to the end. (B) A popular uprising is like a kind of war. The party committee, the headquarters, and the military transport committee must carefully review it when preparing to launch it. Create a popular uprising situation, determine the popular uprising situation, and create various conditions for the popular uprising action.</p>
<p>Strengthen the Authority of Military Party Committees at All Levels. In order to transform the military situation into a comprehensive revolutionary military struggle, the Central Political Bureau and the Military Commission believe that it is necessary to strengthen discipline and ideological unity, correct military command, and the unity of military actions, and decide on the authority of military party committees at all levels as follows: A. Military party committees at all levels have absolute authority over individual instructions and military orders issued to various military regions, army groups, and commanders. Those who violate this will be executed. B. Instructions and military orders issued by commanders of military regions and army groups at all levels are absolutely invalid without the countersignature of the party committee. C. When there are discrepancies between the military actions of commanders and party committees at all levels, the party's decision must be followed. D. In cases of urgent necessity, party committees at all levels have the right to detain and remove armed commanders and unit commanders first, and then report to higher levels. Those who violate this will be executed. E. Political departments and instructors at all levels are directly subordinate to the party committee, military region commanders, and commanders at all levels, and may not interfere with their work.</p>
<p>Sabotage Telecommunications</p>
<p>Regarding the tasks of military party committees at all levels in underground struggle: (1) Military party committees at all levels must thoroughly implement the "Three Main Rules of Discipline" and the "Eight Points for Attention" in all units. (2) War is determined by strengthening the struggle, and even more so by the loyal combat of soldiers who hold weapons. Therefore, the party's activities in various units must be centered on soldiers and based on small groups. (3) Regarding armed popular uprising assaults, it is necessary to determine the key to victory or defeat, and in the location that determines victory or defeat, gather a force far exceeding the enemy's, because otherwise, the popular uprising armed forces will be eliminated by the enemy with better weapons. (4) To achieve success in an armed mutiny uprising, it is necessary to vigorously launch attacks on telephone bureaus, telegraph operators, railway stations, and various river-crossing bridges. (5) Occupying various transportation agencies and transportation hubs, and large-scale destruction of railway tracks and overturning of vehicles, is to enable the insurgents to use these agency tools to isolate the armed forces of the "White Party Bandit Army." (6) Universally destroying railway tracks on the eve of the uprising is of great significance. Occupying bridges and destroying roads, and changing the terrain, is of extreme importance for the connection between the uprising center and the valley edge area.</p>

<h3>Many Rice Shops in Hangzhou are Smashed; High Prices with No Goods Incite Public Anger; Municipal Government Decides to Release 2,000 Shi Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 2nd] Today, Hangzhou City is completely in a state of chaos. Due to the ineffectiveness of the city's efforts to suppress rice prices, the 127,000-portion ration of rice is available at a price but with no goods, and the black market price has risen to 260,000, which has incited public anger, similar to the typhoon smashing last March, it has spread throughout the city. Only a very small portion of the more than 300 large and small rice shops have been spared. Even the police station was attacked. The situation did not subside from morning to dusk, and it was more intense than last year. In the morning, impoverished citizens purchased rationed rice everywhere but found nothing. Wandering on the streets, gathering in groups, the resentment turned into venting on rice shops. Initially, they rushed into Zhang Kunyuan's Daxing Grain Shop and Jufengnian Grain Shop on Qingchun Street, the director of the Hangzhou Grain Industry Association. They found that the former had over 2,000 bags of rice stored, and the latter had over 1,000 bags. So they shouted "Smash, smash!" For a time, white rice was scattered everywhere, and property was destroyed. The poor people rushed home with rice using baskets, sacks, and clothes. Some of the crowd then scattered to Caishi Bridge and other places on the street, smashing rice shops along the way. The smashing sound started and resonated everywhere. By noon, areas such as Hou Dong Street Road, Jitai Road, Gulou Wai Dingsi Bridge, and even Gongchen Bridge in the suburbs, were like madmen, smashing rice shops on a large scale. Even with the suppression of military police, they were unable to do anything. The rice merchants then supplied rice for sale as much as possible. As a result, not only was the rationed rice released, but even high-quality white rice was lowered to 100,000 per shi, and the shops were spared from being smashed. Among them, the Daxing Grain Shop suffered greater losses. In addition to the rice in the store, more than 3,000 bags of white rice in the warehouse next to the Provincial Party Headquarters, as well as flour, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains, were all robbed, and it did not stop until late at night. In addition, more than 1,000 bags each were taken from Juyuanxin Grain Shop, Yongtaireng Rice Shop, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus warehouse, Dahua Xieji, Shengtian Xie, and other places. The police station initially planned to suppress it, but it was ineffective. Police Chief Shen Pu went to inspect the scene and was surrounded by the crowd on Wushan Road and was beaten. The police station arrested two people as a result, and then the crowd flocked to the bustling area, and the Second Branch Bureau was smashed a lot, and the rice milling factory was also destroyed, resulting in significant losses. In addition, poor people at the Great Hotel robbed military rice, causing gunfire, resulting in three soldiers being injured. At 7 p.m., the municipal government convened an emergency meeting and decided to release 2,000 shi starting on the 3rd, with each person limited to purchasing 5 sheng, and resolved: (1) The provincial and municipal governments should take effective measures to maintain social order and issue an announcement to reassure the people. (2) The rice industry association should still find ways to resume operations and should be protected by the government. (3) The losses this time were very large, and the provincial and municipal governments should investigate the facts and discuss appropriate solutions. (4) The municipal government should handle price control and offer rice at a fair price to the market to avoid panic. (5) The municipal government should, together with the Civilian Food Purchase and Sales Committee, request the Four Banks Joint Office to quickly allocate huge sums of money to purchase grain. (6) The difference between the grain-producing areas and the rice market in this city should be asked for the Ministry of Food to allocate a portion from the surplus funds in the existing grain and the price stabilization fund, and the provincial and municipal governments should quickly mediate labor disputes. If there are strikes or slowdowns, they should be immediately persuaded to resume work.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangxian Reports to the Provincial Assembly, Councilors Raise Questions</p>
<p>After inspecting various places, the reporter went to the provincial government to visit the provincial authorities. At that time, Chairman Shen was discussing the causes and remedies of the turmoil with Secretary-General Lei. Then, Secretary-General Lei, on behalf of Chairman Shen, went to the municipal government to meet Mayor Zhou and to report to the Provincial Assembly. The reporter was invited to go in the same car. Mayor Zhou said that the Hangzhou City's disposal of rice and grain had been handled very well and that there should be no more rice shop smashing. According to the usual practice of calming down the last turmoil, martial law should be imposed. At this time, Chairman Shen received a phone call and went to the provincial government again. It was decided to convene the Civilian Food Purchase and Sales Committee at 7 p.m. on the 2nd to discuss the continued operation of rice shops and the prevention of the expansion of the smashing trend, while temporarily preparing to prevent villains from mixing in and taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Then, Secretary-General Lei, Mayor Zhou, the reporter, and others went to the Provincial Assembly in the same car. The meeting was discussing another issue. Speaker Zhang Qiang announced the cessation of the discussion and Mayor Zhou reported instead. As soon as the report began, Councilor Yu Shaosong asked why the rice price was allowed to rise so high? Just as Mayor Zhou was about to reply, Councilor Liao Jia asked where the 1,000 dan of rice released by the Four Banks was allocated each day? Lu Bingpu immediately asked, "I don't know what the government's control measures are for rice merchants?" Jin Yueguang continued, "Martial law is not the solution." Zheng Bangxian said: "Today's turmoil is caused by the government's excessive trust in rice merchants." Shi Yan said: "Today, in addition to seeing rice shops being smashed, I also saw the masses gathering in front of this council, and I learned that the Director and Deputy Director of the Provincial Field and Grain Office and the Director of the Hangzhou Rice Industry Association were hoarding rice in partnership. The masses detected it and smashed it at their hoarding place. May I ask the mayor if this is true?" Later, Xu Ziliang, Jin Yueguang, Zhou Yangsong, and others raised questions one after another. Mayor Zhou, in order to deal with the aftermath of the turmoil, accepted the suggestions and left. Then, Secretary-General Lei was invited to report, and the councilors raised questions again.</p>

<p>In addition, the Sichuan Provincial Government submitted suggestions to the Field and Grain Conference for the grain requisition issue in the 36th year, requesting (1) to continue to handle it in two categories, in-kind requisition and borrowing, according to the methods of the 35th year, and the amounts should be set at 4.5 million shi respectively. The principal and interest of the treasury bonds due in the 30th and 31st years that should be returned should also be offset under the borrowing item. The central government will still obtain more than 3.6 million shi of in-kind, and the provinces and counties should divide the regular grain and an additional 30%, which is the same as last year. (2) Although borrowing will be suspended this year, the amount of in-kind requisition should still be 4.5 million shi in accordance with the central government's decree of reducing and exempting in two years last year. In addition to the provincial and county levels, the central government should receive 30%, which is more than 1.35 million shi. The principal and interest of the treasury bonds due in the 30th and 31st years that should be returned, which is more than 2.1 million shi, should be repaid by the central government at the current price in legal currency.</p>

<h3>印艦葛德維瑞號　招待京記者參觀</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] The Indian warship Godavari, on its first visit to China, held a press conference on board on the morning of the 2nd, with senior officers accompanying the journalists on a tour of the ship's various facilities. The group of reporters arrived at the Godavari, anchored in the Jiangxin area of Xiaguan, around 11:00 AM. The ship's captain, General Kamaja, greeted them at the bow. His imposing stature and refined, courteous demeanor left an excellent impression. According to him, "It is a great honor for our ship to come to China at the invitation of your government for its first historic official visit. China and India are both ancient historical countries, and our relationship is not just a matter of days. This visit is a pleasing renewal of old friendships. India will soon be completely independent, and the army, navy, and air force will all be under the control of Indians in the future, which is a cause for optimism." The ship's machinery is all state-of-the-art, equipped with the latest radar and other modern equipment. Although its displacement is only 1,460 tons, its firepower should not be underestimated. After the tour, the captain treated the guests to Indian curry rice. Although knives and forks were provided, it was in accordance with Indian customs to use both hands instead, which gave a novel impression. The ship will remain in Nanjing for several days and is scheduled to leave for Shanghai on the 7th to return to India.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 2nd] The Nepalese delegation to China, led by General Krishna, arrived in Nanjing by car from Shanghai at approximately 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. After disembarking, they were escorted by Li Jun, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others who welcomed them at the station to the Lizhi Society for rest. On the morning of the 3rd, they will visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. That same afternoon, they will pay respects to Foreign Minister Wang, President Zhang, Vice President Sun, and Mayor Shen.

General Krishna met with reporters at his residence on the evening of the 2nd and made a brief statement, saying, "We have traveled a long way to visit your country's capital, and our joy is immeasurable. In recent years, I have traveled all over Europe and have long desired to visit your great nation. Today, my wish has been fulfilled, and it is a great pleasure to visit this largest neighbor for the first time. China has a long and great culture, and despite hardships, it has been able to stand firm to this day, which is admirable. The friendly relations between China and Nepal have always been very close. Nepal sent a delegation to China as early as 1909. This is the second time a Nepalese delegation has visited China, while your country's delegations have visited our country three times, in 1922, 1934, and 1946. Our delegation is a goodwill mission whose main task is to present President Chiang Kai-shek with the King of Nepal's Special Grand Cordon, the highest medal that the King of Nepal can bestow upon the leaders of other countries. In the past, it has been awarded to the monarchs of England and Belgium. In addition, the Goddess Three Powers Medal, awarded by the King of Nepal, will be presented to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, which is also the highest medal that the King of Nepal can bestow upon leaders in the women's community of other countries. We have also brought with us letters personally written by the King of Nepal and the Prime Minister to President Chiang Kai-shek. We believe that this visit will contribute to further strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries." Today, in addition to the national flag of the Republic of China, a pair of triangular sun and moon flags were also displayed at the Lizhi Society Plaza. This is the national flag of Nepal.

<h3>社論　國內局勢的新展望</h3>
<p>Editorial: New Prospects for the Domestic Situation</p>
<p>At the Legislative Yuan meeting the day before yesterday, the newly appointed Premier Zhang Qun attended to report on the future policy objectives, saying: "We will make efforts from all sides to bring the military measures taken by the government due to the suppression of the rebellion to a swift end, so that we can fundamentally resolve the domestic disputes with political methods and restore the goal of unification as soon as possible." Furthermore, he said: "The current economy is extremely difficult, which has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. We must strive to balance revenue and expenditure and minimize the difference between the two. At the same time, we must also strive to consolidate the currency... abide by the spirit of the constitution, protect the people's freedom, and severely punish corruption..." All of the above is concise and to the point, and the scope it encompasses is extremely broad, which is truly worthy of deep reflection by the general public. Premier Zhang's report, although made to the Legislative Yuan, can also be said to be addressed to the people through the Legislative Yuan. His report and answers, whether related to the political situation, the current difficulties of the national economy, or our country's international relations, were all able to be succinctly clarified. His demeanor was humble and did not lose the style of a statesman, which gave the people a good impression. According to news reports, there was more criticism of the established national policy than questions about how to implement the national policy. The question of "whether unification or peace should come first" was particularly heated, and there was a desire for "the Executive Yuan to devote 50% of its efforts to addressing the issue of peaceful unification." The situation was heated, as one can imagine.</p>
<p>Due to this meeting of the Legislative Yuan, we have even higher expectations for the development of the domestic situation in the future. What we find gratifying is that in addition to Premier Zhang, the Vice Premier, Minister of Defense, Minister of Finance, Minister of Communications, and heads of relevant ministries and commissions attended the Legislative Yuan meeting. The large number of Executive Yuan attendees seems unprecedented. In addition, Premier Zhang's conciliatory attitude and the Legislative Yuan members' enthusiastic speeches fully demonstrate the improvement in the relationship between the legislative and executive branches. It can be seen that the executive and legislative branches will be in a mutually supportive position in the future and will not repeat the mistakes of the past. This is something that the people of the country can be pleased about. Legislation and rule-making are originally the purview of the Legislative Yuan, while how laws and regulations are used and implemented is the responsibility of the executive branch. The legislative and executive branches should be mutually supportive and regarded as one. However, due to the lack of proper relations in the past, a gulf has arisen between the legislative and executive branches, which is truly regrettable. Now, the executive branch is changing its past habits and establishing a democratic and constitutional style. The closer relationship between the legislative and executive branches in the future will naturally be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Whether military first, political first, or economic first, the current domestic situation is, as Premier Zhang said, related to all three and difficult to separate. Although the Executive Yuan under the current system is not the highest decision-making body for national policy, it holds the great power of national governance. As a department of the government, its significance in the political aspect seems to be limited to the implementation of national policy and general administration. The Premier of the Executive Yuan may be able to undertake some tasks that do not belong to the Executive Yuan in nature. The undertaking of these tasks is outside the law and, strictly speaking, is not his responsibility. Therefore, the so-called "new Executive Yuan is a political government, and we hope that it can devote 80% of its efforts to seeking the realization of peaceful unification," although it holds twelve points of sincerity for the country and the people, it always feels somewhat strained and close to overstepping the bounds of propriety. As for peaceful unification and unified peace, although the arrangement of this sequence is of great importance, it seems that it is not necessary to raise it again today. After the failure of peaceful unification, there was then the decision of unified peace. Since the national policy has been set, unification has not rejected peace. Raising this issue again at this time seems to lack consideration in terms of political wisdom. There is no one in the country who does not hope for peace, and the same is true for the government. When we read Premier Zhang's report, "We will make efforts from all sides to bring the military measures taken by the government due to the suppression of the rebellion to a swift end, so that we can fundamentally resolve the domestic disputes with political methods and restore the goal of unification as soon as possible," we can see the government's sincerity. Even when it is forced to use military force, it still hopes that the military measures can be brought to a swift end, so that it can fundamentally resolve the domestic disputes with political methods and restore the goal of unification as soon as possible. We welcome the expression of this attitude, which is truly the highest manifestation of a spirit of forbearance.</p>
<p>However, what the general public hopes for from the new government at the moment is naturally how it can alleviate the economic difficulties they are experiencing. The unresolved military and political situation certainly cannot completely solve the current economic situation, but the current economic situation also cannot wait until the military and political situation is resolved before thinking of solutions. While it may take time to address the root cause, there must be some measures to address the symptoms. Therefore, from the perspective of the general public, what the people hope for from the government is a reduction in economic difficulties more than anything else, because it is directly related to their own interests, so their expectations are even greater. Judging from the current situation, the core of this economic problem seems to revolve around the implementation of the emergency economic plan. As Premier Zhang said, the implementation of this plan has indeed achieved considerable results. If this plan had not been proposed at the time, it seems that the current economic situation would not be possible. However, there are also some facts before us that deserve our attention. Taking the price of rice alone, it has risen from more than 60,000 yuan when the plan was implemented to more than 300,000 yuan in just over two months. The speed of the increase is unprecedented. This shows that the government's control over prices has not been effective due to the implementation of the emergency economic plan; on the contrary, prices have soared due to the implementation of this plan. Since prices cannot be frozen, what can be frozen is only wages and salaries. Under this unbalanced development, it will inevitably lead to serious social unrest. In addition, although the black market prices of gold and foreign exchange are not seen in newspapers, the existence of black market prices seems undeniable. According to today's situation, the current economic difficulties seem to be even greater than they were when the economic plan was issued. We hope that the government can quickly come up with a way to alleviate the current economic difficulties.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure, Premier Zhang stated that economic problems should be solved with economic methods. At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan, he also said: The emergency economic measures, although very effective in overcoming the economic crisis in February of this year, are no longer sufficient to cope with the current economic situation. The government authorities are reviewing them and then deciding whether to modify or abolish them. This is truly a correct reading. Economic phenomena are originally governed by economic laws. We can temporarily use political power to control economic changes, but such control cannot last long, and the effectiveness of it is also a question. Regarding the current economic crisis, we hope that the measures that the government comes up with will no longer repeat the mistakes of the past in placing too much emphasis on political power. Only when the economic difficulties are gradually alleviated and the people's lives are more stable will the development of the nation have a real future. This is truly a major test for the current government.</p>

<h3>聯合國大會通過　設立聖地調查會　猶代表可獲准陳述意見</h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly Passes Resolution to Establish Holy Land Investigation Committee, Jewish Representatives May Be Permitted to State Opinions</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] The Arab countries' request for this special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the end of the British Mandate and declare the independence of Palestine has failed. The Assembly today rejected it by a vote of 24 to 15, with 10 abstentions. Chairman Aranha instructed the committee to meet tomorrow morning to decide whether to allow Jewish representatives to participate in the issue, and submit it to the General Assembly for review in the afternoon. Today's afternoon meeting lasted four and a half hours. The Arab countries knew from the beginning that their struggle was hopeless, but they continued to argue endlessly. The General Assembly finally included the British proposal to establish a fact-finding committee on the agenda.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 1st] The United States today suddenly changed its attitude and no longer opposes the participation of Jews in the UN General Assembly's special meeting to discuss the Palestinian issue, and is looking for ways to allow Jewish representatives to participate. This is clearly the result of repeated appeals from the Jewish Congress to President Truman to urge the State Department to change its position. However, Britain has not changed its position, and the strategies taken by the United Kingdom and United States are now showing signs of divergence for the first time.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] The United Kingdom and the United States have different opinions on whether to allow Jewish representatives to attend the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestinian issue. The General Assembly Steering Committee met today to discuss the matter, and it is likely that Jewish representatives will be allowed to attend in some capacity. It is reported that US representative Austin will propose to allow Jewish representatives to speak at the 55-nation Political Committee, but without the right to vote. This committee is a disguised form of the General Assembly, and all major issues must be reviewed by it before being submitted to the General Assembly for a vote. However, Britain has stated that it is prepared to oppose this. Another US proposal is to set up a special committee for Jewish representatives to attend and speak, and then submit a report to the Political Committee. This would avoid setting a precedent for allowing non-member states to attend. Britain is said to be considering this. However, the Jewish Congress has stated that it will not attend a committee organized by a small number of countries unless it is allowed to speak before all 55 nations. Britain will only allow Jewish representatives to state their opinions to the Palestinian issue investigation committee.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The "New York Times" reported that the United Nations organization expects that the General Assembly will decide to send a committee to Palestine and has booked 65 berths on the US ship "Sea Carp," which is scheduled to leave the United States early next month.</p>
<h3>貝文論世界和平　以耐心及期望勗勉國人</h3>
<p>Bevin Discusses World Peace, Encourages Citizens with Patience and Hope</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech to a Labour Party meeting in his constituency, spoke of the Moscow Conference and encouraged people with patience and hope. Bevin said: "I believe that all the issues are serious issues, so rather than hastily establish a peace that is not genuine, it is better to spend more time establishing a good peace. This issue, although only a German or European issue, has an impact on the entire world peace. If we establish a bad compromise, it will cause the world to embark on the wrong path again, thus making a big mistake that will harm future generations." Bevin went on to describe the situation in the European countries formerly occupied by Germany, saying that the mortality rate in those countries was very high. When he passed through Poland, the Polish Prime Minister told him that Poland previously had a population of 35 million, but today it only has 22 million. The city of Warsaw is only a skeleton, and the center of the city was completely burned down, deliberately destroyed by the Nazis before their retreat. In other parts of Europe, the entire economy has also been destroyed. Bevin said: "There will inevitably be many difficulties in rebuilding these countries. The politicians of these countries must put down their swords and establish peace. And when making peace, they must ensure that their children will never fight each other again in the future." He said that although he was disappointed in Moscow, he did not feel impatient.</p>
<p>Contents of Bevin-Stalin Talks Not Disclosed by Officials</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] Regarding Foreign Secretary Bevin's talks with Marshal Stalin in Moscow, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office refused to disclose the contents today, saying only that a British reporter had called to say that Marshal Stalin had no objection to Britain regarding the Ruhr area as a "conquered province" and forcibly conscripting German workers. This statement is not true. Marshal Stalin only stated that he understood that Britain was forced to force Germans to work.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] Foreign Secretary Bevin attended a cabinet meeting today after returning from Moscow to report on the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference. In addition, former Prime Minister Churchill today asked the House of Commons to discuss foreign policy, but Privy Councilor Morrison has not been able to determine the date for the discussion of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Eden Strongly Advocates Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[Reuters, Birmingham, 1st] Former British War Secretary Eden, in a speech to young Conservative Party members here, said that the failure of the Moscow Conference could stimulate the work of German unification. The merger of the British and American zones may be extended to the French zone in the future. Eden also said: "The United States has a major task in Europe, which is now obvious. If the United Kingdom wishes to maintain its proper leadership position in Europe, politicians from the United Kingdom and the United States must establish a close understanding. The door to full cooperation with our Soviet Union allies remains open forever. We have now reached true global unity. There is no way to maintain lasting peace other than this."</p>

<p>(1) The size of the future United Nations army and the ratio of military quotas allocated to major and small countries; (2) Whether the seven major powers should provide exactly the same troops and equipment to several countries; (3) The method of obtaining permission from the various United Nations countries for the United Nations army to use their bases and facilities. Other unresolved issues include the repatriation of troops from various countries after aggression has been stopped, where troops from various countries should be stationed while awaiting orders from the Security Council, and how they should be supplied by their home countries. It is expected that the representative of the country that contributes the most to the international army will be selected as the supreme commander, but this matter still awaits the resolution of differences of opinion among the Soviet Union and other member countries regarding the organization of the future international army. Judging from the Staff Committee's report, the prospects for the establishment of an international army are extremely dim. This is not only because the member countries have not changed their determination that they cannot use an international army to suppress military conflicts, including those involving the five major powers. However, it is said that in view of the current unstable international situation and the differences of opinion among the major powers, the fact that the Staff Committee was able to draft a report is itself a success.</p>

<h3>Authority Reintroduces Old Case of Commuted Labor Service Fee Decides to Have the Bureau of Public Works, Social Affairs Bureau, and Civil Affairs Office Draft Measures, City Government Expects to Collect 56 Billion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The commuted labor service fee for national compulsory labor, which was once rejected by the City Council, was brought up for discussion again at yesterday's municipal administration meeting. The plan and implementation measures will be drafted by the Bureau of Public Works in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Affairs Office. This reporter made a special visit to Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, last night. According to him, the draft plan will not go beyond the following three principles: (1) What form? According to the decision of last year, the method of commutation will be adopted. According to the central government's regulations, all able-bodied men must perform ten days of compulsory service for the country each year, and those who do not provide labor may commute it with cash. The city has a total population of more than four million, and the number of able-bodied men is estimated to be one-fifth of the total population, that is, 800,000. If based on the current wage of temporary workers employed by the Bureau of Public Works, which averages about 7,000 yuan per day, then ten days would be 70,000 yuan, and the total amount of national labor service commutation fees that the city government could collect would be about 56 billion. However, according to Director Zhao, in addition to the method of collecting commutation fees, it is also planned to refer to the current method of conscripting labor by district for dredging rivers in the bureau. Because the achievements of the river dredging projects in the Zhenru, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Longhua districts of the city are good, the method of conscripting labor by district will also be considered. (2) What kind of work? The scope of work will not go beyond water conservancy and roads. According to Director Zhao, if labor is conscripted by district, construction will begin in order of priority according to the needs of each district. If the method of commutation fees is adopted uniformly throughout the city, then the progress of work should be equal in each district, so that the interests of all citizens of the city are equal. (3) What kind of organization? In Nanjing, a National Compulsory Labor Committee has already been organized to specialize in this matter. Whether a committee will also be established in this city or a labor service agency will be established will be discussed with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Affairs Office. After the draft plan and implementation measures are prepared, they will be submitted to the third general meeting of the City Council for decision.</p>
<h3>Four Rice Merchants Punished</h3>

(2) Guan Zhicheng, manager of Runde Rice Store at No. 16 Yaoshui Lane, Xikang Road, detained for four days. (3) Li Xiongxiang, manager of Taifeng Rice Store at No. 77 Luxiangyuan Road, detained for three days. (4) Lu Jinyuan, manager of Tongfeng Rice Store at No. 116 Luxiangyuan Road, detained for three days.</p>
<h3>Thousand Bags of Hoarded Rice Found in Zikang Bank Warehouse</h3>
<p>The economic team of the garrison headquarters discovered 1,047 bags of rice in the warehouse of Zikang Bank yesterday. The rice has been sealed and the owner is being investigated.</p>
<h3>Zhongyong Foreign Firm Illegal Case Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhongyong Foreign Firm in the Citibank Building on Jiujiang Road was paying in US dollars to buy American stocks, which violated the law. After being investigated by the police department, the case will be transferred to the district prosecutor's office for interrogation today.

<h3>Police Department Investigates Kangyuan Bank</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a tip-off received by the economic section of the police department, Kangyuan Bank at No. 6, Tianlun Building, No. 306 Nanjing Road, was engaging in black market gold and currency transactions.

The manager of the bank, Wu Boxuan, was not present, and the employee Wang Guoting is being interrogated by the police department.</p>
<h3>Discussing with Labor Union Representatives to Improve Employee Life, Gathering Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs told reporters yesterday: After consulting with both labor and management in Shanghai on the issue of improving employee life, I will discuss the matter again with the city government and the Ministry of Social Affairs, and then submit a comprehensive plan to the central government for adoption. Mr. Gu summoned the heads of the General Labor Union and various labor unions yesterday morning to give instructions, explaining in detail the current economic crisis and the central government's policies, saying that the government is determined to protect the minimum living standards of workers, but at the same time must take into account the future of industry. Otherwise, there will be no intact eggs under an overturned nest. Only under the existence of the national economy can class interests exist. From 4:00 PM onwards, Mr. Gu gathered more than 20 senior officials from the General Labor Union and various labor unions at Wu Kaixian's residence to exchange opinions on the issue of improving the lives of workers. The labor representatives suggested conditionally restoring the cost-of-living index wage system, which Mr. Gu believed was reasonable because it could take into account the interests of both labor and management. In the evening, Director Wu hosted a banquet to discuss measures to provide relief to unemployed workers. At 10:00 PM, Wu Yunzhu, Tian Heqing, Hu Boxiang, and other standing directors of the General Association of Chinese Industries visited together. The representatives said that the principles of the Industrial Association Law were passed by the Tenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee more than four years ago, but the full text is still under review by the Executive Yuan. They hoped that Minister Gu would relay the industry's hopes to the central government so that the legislative process could be completed as soon as possible. Mr. Gu will meet with representatives of the industry today and then take the night train back to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>City Council Held First District Government Symposium Yesterday District Heads and Representatives All Put Forward Reviews Based on Actual Needs</h3>
<p>Minister Gu Scheduled to Return to Nanjing Tonight</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The City Council held its first district government symposium yesterday. The chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the district heads and deputy district heads of Huangpu, Laoza, Xincheng, and Jing'an districts, including Jiang Zhaohu, Liu Xiexun, Ren Jinping, and Lou Yunmei, attended the meeting, which was personally presided over by Speaker Pan. The chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the district heads earnestly put forward reviews based on their actual needs.</p>
<p>Strengthening Contact and Coordinating Opinions</p>
<p>Regarding the district people's representative assemblies: (1) It is hoped that the city councilors elected in each district will strengthen contact with the district people's representative assemblies, and that the councilors will attend the meetings of the district people's representative assemblies. (2) The funding for the district people's representative assemblies is only 32,000 yuan per month, and it is hoped that this will be increased immediately and that they will be allowed to employ full-time staff. (3) It is requested that the Civil Affairs Office of the City Government convene a working meeting of the chairmen of the valley district people's representative assemblies once a month. (4) Some matters, such as road construction, can originally be initiated by each district independently, with the Bureau of Public Works providing technical assistance and guidance, using the district's own resources to complete the work. (5) The power of the district people's representative assemblies to oversee the finances of the district is not expressly stipulated, but there are regulations for each district to raise its own business expenses. This seems to be a legislative oversight, and it should be recommended that the central government quickly supplement the regulations.</p>
<p>Mediation Committees Not Taken Seriously</p>
<p>The opinions of the district heads are as follows: (1) The powers of the district offices should be clearly defined. (2) The district mediation committees have not yet obtained legal status, so the courts do not take the results of mediation seriously, and the people have no faith in the mediation committees. It should be immediately recommended that the central government stipulate their legal status. (3) The matter of contributing to schools to celebrate birthdays should be initiated as soon as possible to avoid being affected by fluctuations in prices again, and the procedures for allocating public land should be simplified. (4) The status of the Baojia heads should be respected by the higher-level government agencies and should not be regarded as slaves.</p>
<p>After listening to everyone's opinions, Speaker Pan said: For those that can be immediately handed over to the relevant agencies for handling, this council is willing to immediately forward the request for handling on their behalf. Those that need to be studied at length will be submitted to the third general meeting of this council for discussion.</p>
<h3>Planning to Strengthen Anti-Smoking Work, Preparing to Establish a Model Rehabilitation Institute</h3>
<p>Anti-Smoking Association Holds Board Meeting</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Anti-Smoking Association held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, and decided to publicly elect Pan Gongzhan as the chairman of the supervisory board and Fang Zhi as the chairman of the board of directors. The selection of the persons in charge of each group will be solicited by the board of directors by letter. In order to strengthen the city's rehabilitation work, a model rehabilitation institute will be established immediately, and appropriate anti-smoking films will be adopted for publicity.</p>
<h3>Further Hearing in the Enemy Support Case of Zhou Manhua's Husband</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Guozhang, the husband of former movie star Zhou Manhua, was accused of supporting the enemy with cotton. The High Court continued to hear the case yesterday, summoning Zhang Xueling, the accountant of Maochang Cotton Store, and Peng Yougen, the manager of Pudong Limin Yarn Factory, as witnesses. Zhang testified that Maochang was a partnership company, with Wu Guoxin as the general manager, and the defendant was only the manager. As for doing business with Yoshida Foreign Firm, it was purely a commercial transaction. Peng said that Maochang Cotton Store, opened by Wu and others, did not collect cotton for the Japanese, because the factory site was in the hinterland of Pudong, more than a hundred li away from the riverbank, and there were often guerrillas出沒, so the Japanese army did not dare to go there. He did not know the rest of the situation. The court hearing lasted a long time. Because one witness in the case had not yet arrived, it was adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>Chen Lihong and Luo Zhiqiang were both accused of having served as translators for the enemy army. After a brief hearing in the High Court yesterday, it was ordered that the hearing be adjourned to another day.</p>
<h3>Claiming that Death by Reverse Expression Would Allow One to Die with Peace of Mind, New Evidence Insufficient to Adopt, High Court Rules to Reject</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After Fu Shishuo, the former pseudo-governor of Zhejiang Province, was sentenced to death, he applied to the High Court for a retrial. The High Court has now ruled to reject the application. The reason for the ruling is roughly as follows: The new evidence presented in this application for a retrial (referring to the rescue of underground workers Mao [blank], Shen Xiaomei), cannot affect the confirmed judgment. After reviewing the case, the defendant was a high-ranking pseudo-official and an important member of the pseudo-central government. Unless he is sentenced to capital punishment, it will not be enough to serve as a warning. As for his wife, Chuan Zhang [blank], listing Luo Junqiang and Chen Chunguo as examples in the statement, the circumstances of each person's crime are different and difficult to compare. It is insufficient to adopt the request for a retrial, and it should be rejected and not allowed.</p>
<h3>High Prosecutor's Office Indicts Four Suspected Traitors, Li Xiaobin Gained Wealth by Opening Gambling Dens, Li Quanshi Was Devoid of National Integrity, Zhang Jixin and Huang Zuoqing Both Increased Their Submission to the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Li Xiaobao, one of the maritime bullies during the enemy-puppet period, has now been indicted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason. The indictment states: After Shanghai fell, Li entered the door of Lu Ying of the pseudo-police station and also worshiped his third concubine as his adoptive mother, serving as a detective of the pseudo-police station and deputy director of the special service office. He opened a Western-style gambling den and became rich in a few years. After the victory, he fled and was reported by a person named Quan Chenshi. His actions clearly constitute the crimes under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. It is said that Li is currently hiding in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Li Quanshi served in the education sector in Shanghai before the war and enjoyed the reputation of being an authoritative economic scholar. However, he lacked national integrity and participated in pseudo-organizations, successively serving as the director of the pseudo-economic research institute, a consultant to the pseudo-Shanghai municipal government, and a member of the pseudo-national economic committee. After the victory, he fled without a trace. The Teacher Appraisal Committee of Shanghai District Colleges and Universities of the Ministry of Education reported the matter to the Ministry of Education, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Justice for investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, it was determined that the defendant's crimes were obvious and constituted the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. A public prosecution has been filed.</p>
<p>Zhang Jixin, who served as a professor at Jida University before the war, was also indicted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason for taking the position of director of the education department of the pseudo-Central University after submitting to the enemy.</p>
<p>Huang Zuoqing was a henchman of Ding Mocun, successively serving as a specialist in the pseudo-Social Movement Promotion Association, a secretary in the pseudo-Ministry of Social Welfare, and the pseudo-county magistrate of Haining County and executive committee member of the pseudo-county party department, extorting and plundering without restraint. The Ministry of Justice approved the Intelligence Order of the Central Bureau of Statistics and Investigation to be issued to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The High Prosecutor's Office investigated the Haining County government and found that the reply was generally the same. The High Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution on suspicion of treason.</p>
<h3>Trial of Pseudo-Police Chief Gao Linsen Concluded</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Gao Linsen, from Shandong, was accused of having served as a translator for the enemy's Uchida Unit and the Oshima Unit, a major secretary in the Shanghai Office of the 34th Pseudo-Army Division, and a police chief in the Pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Police Department. He was retained after the victory. Because his wife was over thirty years old, he sent out a large number of invitation cards, and someone filed a complaint with the District Court. The District Court discovered a curriculum vitae form during the trial of the case. Because he had held pseudo-positions in the past, he was suspected of being a traitor, so he was transferred to the High Court for handling. Gao claimed during the trial yesterday, "The above-mentioned pseudo-positions were actually fabricated in the resume when I applied for the position of police chief in the pseudo-police department and are not reliable." The court ordered the trial to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 9th.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Overseas Chinese to Arrive in Shanghai from the US</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Service Agency recently received a telegram from its American branch reporting that overseas Chinese leaders Kuang Guoshun, Ma Gaode, Lei Jialian, and hundreds of returning overseas Chinese will arrive in Shanghai on the Hai Mao ship on the 7th of this month. The agency has prepared to be responsible for the reception.</p>
<p>In addition, there are more than 40 distressed overseas Chinese in Singapore who have been repatriated through the efforts of the United Relief Agency and will arrive in Shanghai on the French postal ship Champollion on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Literary Writers Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting Tomorrow</h3>

The meeting will discuss the association's charter, declaration, and the election of directors and supervisors. Those who have already received membership application forms but have not yet submitted them to the preparatory committee can bring the forms to the meeting for registration.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau's Various Plans Difficult to Realize Due to Economic Constraints</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chen Bozhuang, the director of the Two Road Bureaus, went to Nanjing on official business at the end of last month. When he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, he met with this reporter and said that the restoration plan formulated by the bureau was completed last month. However, new construction plans are difficult to realize in the current situation due to limited funding and difficulties in applying for foreign exchange. Although Mr. Chen denied that his trip to Nanjing was to apply for subsidies or increase fares, he pointed out that it is a great regret that the traffic congestion caused by the low freight and ticket prices cannot be improved. Mr. Chen expressed his views on the future work of the bureau, saying, "Do as much as you can with the money you have." Under the current economic conditions, it is already difficult to maintain the status quo, and the various plans that have been formulated can only be shelved.</p>
<h3>Mao Dun and Wife Return from Soviet Union, Two Associations Host Tea Party Welcome</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Literary writer Mao Dun (Shen Yanbing) and his wife, having newly returned from the Soviet Union, were welcomed by the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association and the China National Association of Literary and Art Workers at a tea party held at the YMCA yesterday at 3 PM. Over 300 cultural figures attended, including Yan Huiqing, Li Zhaohuan, Guo Moruo, Ye Shengtao, Tian Han, Zhang Ximan, Chen Guolian, and Ma Zongrong. The Soviet Consul-General in Shanghai, Harin, was also invited to attend and deliver a speech. The event was chaired by Li Zhaohuan, and Mr. and Mrs. Mao Dun were invited to speak about their "Impressions of Traveling in the Soviet Union."</p>
<h3>Liu Jingyi Discusses Future Civil Aviation Plans: Developing Border Province Transportation, Opening International Air Routes, No Matter the Cost</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Liu Jingyi, the newly appointed General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, assumed office the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he spoke in detail with reporters about plans to develop civil aviation in the future, stating that domestic air routes are already of a considerable scale. The primary goals going forward are, first, to improve facilities to the extent economically feasible, and second, to open new air routes to adapt to the political situation. For example, air routes to border provinces such as Xinjiang are purely loss-making from a commercial standpoint, but they have significant value from a national political perspective and therefore must be undertaken. In terms of international routes, because the 20th century is the century of aviation, countries in Europe and America, even small ones like the Netherlands and Belgium, all have international air routes. China cannot lag behind, so even if it means losing money, the country must be supported. For example, the soon-to-be-launched Sino-US air route is estimated to cost approximately US$25,000 per one-way flight, while passenger and cargo revenue is only US$20,000. In other words, each flight will incur a loss of US$5,000. However, despite this, it is still necessary to proceed. This air route is expected to officially open in mid-June. In addition, new air routes such as Sino-French and Sino-British routes are currently being negotiated by government authorities. Liu continued, stating another ideal: he believes that Beijing is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If safety and comfort can be maximized in terms of travel and accommodation, it will surely attract international tourists to visit. This would also bring in a large amount of foreign exchange for the country. Therefore, China National Aviation Corporation will strive to develop and improve the Beijing air route in the future.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Reviewing Exemption and Deferment Applications</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to a spokesperson from the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters: The household survey of eligible young men in this city has already begun.

<h3>"Foreign Tiger" Appeal to be Heard Today, Prosecutor Submits Supplementary Brief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] "Foreign Tiger" Meisber, after being sentenced to one year in prison by the District Court, appealed to the High Court. At the same time, the prosecutor in charge, Quan Tao, believes that the sentence was too lenient and also filed an appeal. The High Court has scheduled a hearing for the case this morning. Prosecutor Quan submitted a supplementary appeal brief yesterday, stating briefly: In mid-February of this year, the price of gold and US dollars rose sharply, with gold rising from 400,000 yuan to over 900,000 yuan, and prices followed suit. The National Government then took extraordinary measures and formulated an emergency economic plan. Meisber blatantly disregarded the laws that our country widely promulgates and obeys. The original judgment stated that he was a foreign businessman who was unfamiliar with our country's laws and only sentenced him to one year, which is difficult to consider fair. Moreover, the defendant is a large foreign buyer with the real ability to manipulate black market prices for foreign currency, as evidenced by transaction records. The original sentence was too lenient and did not achieve the purpose of improvement, but would only encourage contempt for our country's laws.</p>

<h3>Beef Stall Assistant Dies from Assault</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Fusheng and his wife, Li Wangshi, from Songjiang, who live at No. 131, Lane 575, Tangshan Road, run a coffee stall at Pier 12 on the Bund. Yesterday evening at 6:30 PM, Cai Youfu, from Yangzhou, who runs a beef stall next to Pier 11, was setting up his stall when his assistant, Bu Xiaotu (from Danyang, 26 years old), accidentally knocked over one of Li's seat benches. Mr. and Mrs. Li immediately stepped forward and tried to overturn the beef stall in retaliation, but Bu stopped them, and an argument ensued. Mrs. Li even reached out and slapped Bu's cheeks twice. Unexpectedly, Li Fusheng could not contain his anger, took off his coat, and punched and kicked Bu repeatedly, inflicting serious injuries that soon led to his death. The Huangpu Police Branch received the report and immediately ordered criminal investigators to rush to the scene and arrest the perpetrator and other accomplices for questioning.

<h3>Cook Kills Wife, Bloodshed Occurs in Lao Tai'an Lane Early This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A bloody incident occurred at No. 53, Lao Tai'an Lane, Fujian North Road, at around 7 AM yesterday morning. Upon receiving the report, the North Railway Station Police Branch, led by Section Chief Shi and police officers Qiu Guishan and Li Xianwen, went to investigate and arrested the perpetrator, Qi Guanrong (31 years old, from Haining), along with the murder weapon, a kitchen knife, and took him to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>According to his confession, he works as a cook at the Hongxing Meal Shop at No. 369, Xiangfen Lane. The victim was his wife, Wu, 30 years old, and they had been married for 11 years. They had two sons and one daughter, all of whom died young. After bringing Wu to Shanghai last year, it was difficult to find housing due to the housing shortage. He boarded and lodged at the meal shop, while Wu worked as a female worker at the Jiang Kangji Light Bulb Factory at No. 709, Yuyao Road, and stayed in the factory's workshop at night. During holidays, they often met in a separate room in a hotel. The day before yesterday, on Labor Day, the factory was closed, and he went to the factory to look for Wu but did not find her. He went to No. 53, Lao Tai'an Lane, to the home of his friend Yu Chenweifang, and saw Wu there. He invited her out, but she refused. He also asked her for money, but she refused, and an argument broke out. Before leaving, Wu told him that they should go their separate ways from now on. He therefore suspected her of infidelity and harbored resentment. So, at around 7 AM yesterday morning, he brought a kitchen knife to Yu's residence and saw her and Yu Chenweifang sleeping head-to-head on the third floor mezzanine. After an argument, he took out the kitchen knife and slashed Wu's head, back, arms, and mouth, inflicting seven or eight cuts. At the same time, Yu Chenweifang was also cut on the left middle finger and ring finger. The victim shouted in pain, alarming the whole house. The second landlord, Shen Gao, and neighbors arrived and surrounded him, and the police were called to arrest him. Wu's injuries were very serious, and the police sent both women to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Shanghai is Responsible for 6 Billion in Funding for the 7th National Games</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the 7th National Games held its first committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the conference room of the Central Research Institute on Qiqi Road. Regarding the budget for the Games, Shanghai is responsible for 6 billion yuan. Mayor Wu expressed his willingness to find ways to raise the funds. Hao Gengsheng, Sports Inspector of the Ministry of Education, reported that there are a total of 44 participating units in this National Games, but since four places, including Xi'an and Shenyang, have been renamed special municipalities, the number of units may increase. Regarding the Air Force's request to join in the name of a unit, Chairman Wu's proposal was discussed in detail by the committee members, and it was decided to leave it to the Standing Committee meeting for further discussion. Whether to set up a championship for table tennis was passed by a majority vote on the spot. Regarding the rules of the National Games, it was resolved that the standards published by the Chinese National Sports Federation would be followed. As for the overall championship of the Games, it was decided to cancel it.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee meeting is scheduled to be held on Sunday, and there will be a detailed discussion of the competition rules of the Games. Wu Guozhen, Director of the Preparatory Committee, recommended Hao Gengsheng to serve as the Secretary-General of the Games, which was approved by all the committee members present. The Deputy Secretary-General will be recommended by the Secretary-General at the Standing Committee meeting.</p>

<h3>Mayor Summoned Members of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee Yesterday to Discuss Cotton Yarn Pricing Issues</h3>
<p>A Subcommittee Meeting Will be Held Today to Discuss Prices Based on Costs</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu invited all members of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee to a banquet at his official residence on Anfu Road yesterday at noon. During the banquet, opinions were exchanged on cotton yarn pricing and re-export issues. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding pricing, the committee members felt that the current government-negotiated price of 4.6 million yuan per piece for 20-count standard yarn was insufficient to cover costs. Mayor Wu stated that the government believed that the failure to negotiate a price for cotton yarn in Shanghai in April was due to indecision and was not an appropriate strategy, so it had decided to negotiate a price in advance. After discussion, it was decided that a pricing subcommittee meeting would be held at the Textile Construction Company at 10:00 AM today to re-discuss prices based on actual production costs, so that the Cotton Yarn Control Committee could review and approve them before submitting them to the central authorities for decision.</p>
<p>Re-export Issues Still Need Review</p>
<p>(2) After discussion, the re-export of cotton yarn was decided in principle to be slightly more strictly restricted for cotton yarn shipped to the Northeast and North China, and a quota system would be adopted. In Central China, since the price difference was not significant, a more lenient policy could be temporarily adopted. This principle will be drafted into measures by the Cotton Yarn Control Committee and submitted to the central authorities for decision after review and approval at a meeting.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Pricing Should Be Reasonable</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a textile industry authority who spoke to a reporter, the government's decision to set the protective price for 20-count standard yarn at 4.6 million yuan per piece would be sufficient to cover costs if calculated based on the cost of UNRRA cotton or quota-imported cotton. However, it would be insufficient if calculated based on the current cost of domestic cotton. He stated that the government's pricing decisions generally focus on the original cost, while most manufacturers focus on the cost of re-production. In his opinion, if pricing decisions are made purely based on the original cost, given the current rapid rise in prices, factories may be unable to maintain re-production. However, if pricing decisions are made purely based on the cost of re-production, the government believes that it would be tantamount to acknowledging the legality of black market prices, which is also inappropriate. Therefore, reasonable pricing should seek an average production cost from both the original cost and the cost of re-production, which would be a reasonable price that takes into account the facts. According to this calculation, the appropriate negotiated price for 20-count standard yarn should be between 5 million and 5.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Suggestions for Construction and Improvement of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry</p>
<p>After the strengthening of cotton yarn and cloth control, the re-export of yarn and cloth from Shanghai to various ports in the north has been temporarily suspended for all but the Textile Construction Company, pending the Cotton Yarn Control Committee's regulations for issuing permits. The Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association yesterday specially presented its opinions to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee for adoption: (1) The current cotton yarn and cloth pricing has failed to take into account the re-production of yarn factories, and the excess of Shanghai yarn prices is excusable if there is no excessive difference. In order to maintain production, the industry has no choice but to purchase cotton yarn at any time, and it is hoped that past practices will be overlooked and no further discussions will be held. (2) The following improvements are suggested for the methods for approving and permitting the re-export of yarn and cloth: A. Cancel the registration procedures for distributors and manufacturers. All members of industry associations related to yarn and cloth industries or commerce have the qualification to apply for distribution. B. The amount of yarn and cloth to be re-exported should be determined based on the amount of cotton yarn used by Shanghai weaving factories, and it is suggested that a limit of 80% of each factory's output be set. Within this limit, permission for re-export can be applied for at any time without restrictions. C. The procedure for applying for permits should be simplified by the industry association. D. The control target should be limited to cotton yarn and grey fabric. E. The control base number should be appropriately increased to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. Cotton yarn should start at one large package, and cotton cloth should be exempted from permits for less than 40 bolts. The above-mentioned presentation was submitted to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee by Pan Shihao, who was dispatched by the association. The Cotton Yarn Control Committee is currently studying it. If the presented sections are indeed reasonable, they will be submitted to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Due to the Textile Construction Company's change in the distribution method, the cotton yarn market is once again showing firmness. Spot prices for 20-count yarn are rising sharply, especially for bleached cloth, which is in high demand from dyeing and weaving factories. 20-count Double Happiness yarn is priced at 4.6 million yuan, and Fengnian cone yarn is priced at 4.7 million yuan, with an increase of 200,000 to 400,000 yuan. 16-count yarn is not in high demand from towel factories, and the price increase is minimal. The Textile Construction Company is selling unbranded yarn as usual. 42-count Baoguang grass package is priced at 99.8 million yuan, and 32-count Xiantao cone yarn is priced at 69.6 million yuan. The prices of all brands of coarse and fine yarn have increased by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan throughout the day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market: The market opened steadily, with 20-count extra-fine cloth priced at 243,000 yuan and available for sale. Then, due to the Textile Construction Company's yarn sales and the news that the company will restrict distribution to industry members to only once a week, the market suddenly became bullish, and new buyers were active in the market, causing prices to rise sharply. In particular, Yuanji cloth rose even more sharply, with Four Gentlemen Golden Seal cloth rising from 268,000 yuan to 285,000 yuan, and 20-count extra-fine cloth rising from 247,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose sharply by 22,000 yuan to 300,500 yuan. Yiding Ruyi bleached cloth was in high demand, with each bolt rising by 30,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan. The market prices of other colored cloth, Yuanbu cloth, blue cloth, and Shilin cloth also rose.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company began distributing cotton yarn according to the newly revised method yesterday, selling a total of 1211 pieces of yarn of various counts. According to regulations, yesterday was purely for manufacturers to apply for purchases, and a total of 421 applications were received. After this change in the yarn distribution method, the highest amount that each Class A manufacturer could be allocated was 48 pieces, and the highest amount that each Class B manufacturer could be allocated was 27 pieces.</p>
<h3>Lower Prices Reported in Production Areas, Rice Price Hikes Subside Slightly, Soybean Oil and Grains See Price Declines</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The rise in rice prices has subsided slightly due to lower prices in the production areas and Mayor Wu's order to raise the retail price limit for Shanghai white rice to 200,000 yuan per stone. The market supply is still scarce, with only 1195.5 stones arriving. Black market prices for white rice are 230,000 to 240,000 yuan. High-quality white Yuan rice is priced at 265,000 yuan, and medium-quality rice is priced at 244,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau released a total of 9,000 bags of white rice at the north and south markets, priced at 147,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Sell Rationed Rice Based on Household Certificates</p>
<p>Since the authorities stipulated that citizens must use their household registration certificates to purchase rationed rice from rice shops, rice shops that have already received rationed rice have begun to implement this method starting yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau has also notified all rice shops that all retail rice must be registered and reported for verification starting yesterday. The authorities have also dispatched 40 people to registered rice shops to check accounts. If any irregularities are found, their distribution qualifications will be revoked.</p>

<p>There Is Talk of Restoring Free Trading of Edible Oil</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's edible oil market trended downwards because it was rumored that the authorities had temporarily allowed each factory to trade freely at market prices, with each stall of edible oil falling by a small amount of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, due to tight credit conditions yesterday, although each factory had sales, the number of transactions was not large, totaling about 1,000 piculs. It is rumored that the authorities have approved each factory to tentatively restore free trading at market prices to see how the results are, and then decide on edible oil countermeasures. People in the industry said that if calculated based on the price of 520,000 yuan per picul of local soybean oil yesterday, the retail price of each jin at each retailer should be a maximum of 5,600 yuan.</p>
<p>This Month's Flour Rationing Will Be Handled as in the Past</p>

It is rumored that Mr. Rong, the person in charge of the Fuxin Flour Mill, has already gone to Beijing to discuss with the grain administration authorities how to maintain flour rationing and dredge the source of wheat. In addition to supplying rationed flour, each factory also sold flour at market prices yesterday.</p>

<h3>Wire Glass Changed to Schedule Three A</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wire glass was originally listed in Schedule Three B as one of the prohibited imports. The Transportation Control Committee has now decided to change it to Schedule Three A, allowing imports to resume.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Raw Silk Exports Have Decreased</h3>
<p>Almost Vanished from the New York City Market</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] The US Department of Commerce stated that China exported 11,500 bales of raw silk in the first eleven months of last year, while its raw silk exports in 1939 were 75,150 bales. The reason for the decrease in export volume is that the price of Chinese raw silk has increased, and the low exchange rate has reduced the purchasing power of the US dollar, making raw silk purchases in the New York market virtually prohibited. The department's report stated that, on the contrary, Yokohama and Kobe, Japan, exported 11,175 bales of raw silk in February of this year, and the allocation agency has allocated 68,707 bales of raw silk for export.</p>

<h3>Sugar Merchants Go to Taiwan to Purchase Sugar</h3>
<p>Since the Taiwan Sugar Corporation stopped supplying sugar merchants, the spot supply of Taiwan sugar in the market has become increasingly scarce, leading to a surge in black market prices. To meet the urgent needs of its members, the industry association has raised funds and sent representatives to Taiwan to purchase sugar directly. It is reported that over 10,000 bags have been ordered and will soon be shipped to Shanghai. According to the market price in Taiwan Province, each Sima dan (approximately 50 kg) of medium-grade sugar is worth about 80 Taiwan dollars. Adding transportation and taxes, the legal currency cost is only about 340,000 yuan, which is more than 100,000 yuan less than the black market price. Therefore, it is expected that the sugar market will stabilize after the sugar arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Bank Establishes Joint Committee to Centralize News Releases</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] To centralize the release of news from the bank, the Central Bank has established a News Liaison Committee, consisting of Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department; Ji Chaoding, Director of the Economic Research Department; and Fan Heyan, Deputy Director of the Secretariat. A dedicated office has been designated, and the three committee members will take turns hosting reporters from various newspapers from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM each day.</p>
<h3>Glutinous Rice Branches High</h3>
<p>Glutinous rice branches are scarce in both arrivals and inventory, resulting in a perceived shortage. Although prices are high, demand remains. Yesterday, market prices rose again by 20% to 30%.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Petitions Central Government to Improve Quota Allocation</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Association petitioned the central authorities and the Import Control Committee yesterday regarding the import of industrial raw materials. The original text is as follows: The allocated quota values for imported goods have not adequately addressed the current need to rescue the critically endangered industries. The Association and its members have previously resolved to petition the government with five requests, which were submitted in document No. 404 on April 26th, requesting adoption and dispatching representatives for a petition. The requests were approved and considered. However, three days later, the quota values for the second phase were announced, leading industrial colleagues to believe that the government was discriminating against the opinions of the industrial sector. Although explanations were given that the quotas had been approved by the Supreme Economic Council and were due to international credit relationships, preventing their cancellation, the government should still reconsider the matter in order to support the national industry. To remedy the existing situation and safeguard the survival of the fragile industries, we propose to request the government again: (1) Regarding the foreign exchange allocated to importers for the first phase of announced import quotas, the Quota Allocation Office should order importers to notify the relevant industrial trade associations of the allocated amounts and types of goods, so that the associations can make reasonable and fair allocations. (2) The right to allocate import quotas for the second phase should be granted to the industrial sector. (3) The quota values for imported goods in the third phase should adopt the opinions of the industrial sector. (4) Essential raw materials and materials that cannot be produced domestically should be classified as Category 1 and exempt from quota restrictions. (5) The government should promptly lift the restrictions on raw materials and materials produced in the Northeast and Taiwan, allowing the industrial sector to freely purchase them. (6) If the government insists that import foreign exchange can only be applied for in the name of importers, then the industrial trade associations should be granted the qualifications of importers to apply. The above six points are the urgent needs of the industrial sector. The Association and its members, on behalf of the entire industrial sector, appeal to the government to review and adopt them, and respectfully await a reply.</p>

<h3>Rice Riots Again in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou Express, April 34th</p>
<p>During February of this year, when the surging tide of gold prices in the country swept through Hangzhou, rice prices also soared, leading to rumors of attacks on rice shops. The municipal authorities urgently convened relevant parties to discuss the issue. Rice merchants insisted that prices were high at the source, making it impossible to lower them. They proposed releasing 1,000 dan of rice from the four banks each day for distribution to rice shops at fixed prices. The municipal government, lacking a better solution, accepted the rice merchants' proposal and authorized the release of 1,000 dan of rice from the four banks to rice shops daily at a fixed price of 73,000 yuan per dan, with a limit of five sheng per household and purchases restricted to stores. However, the rice supplied by the four banks to the rice shops consisted of old rice, broken rice, and inferior rice. Consequently, some middle-class families were willing to pay 100,000 yuan to rice merchants for white rice.</p>
<p>Hongdao Incident: Hoarding Rice</p>
<p>Not long after, the Hongdao Girls' Middle School rice hoarding case involving 1,000 dan of rice was exposed. The incident was discovered late at night by a responsible individual from a certain order maintenance organization. After being reported in the newspapers, Hongdao Girls' Middle School initially denied the allegations, claiming that the rice was intended for the students' consumption and was contracted out to a shop. An investigation by the Municipal Police Bureau also concluded that the allegations were untrue. However, the public remained skeptical. As a result, the municipal government initiated an investigation team that included representatives from the Municipal Council and other organizations. After about a week, it was determined that Hongdao Girls' Middle School had hoarded only a small amount of rice. Various organizations issued reports, which the public trusted. Subsequently, the police arrested several individuals for hoarding rice and smuggling grain. However, the Grain Association proved that the grain was purchased from the production area and transported for sale in the city.</p>
<p>Rice Prices: Frenzied Jumps</p>
<p>In the past month, rice prices have jumped dramatically, from 100,000 yuan per dan to 120,000 yuan, then to 150,000 yuan, and finally to 180,000 yuan or even 200,000 yuan. The official price of rice in Hangzhou is still 127,000 yuan, a significant difference. Four days ago, the head of the Hangzhou Municipal Government's Land and Food Department stated, "The city has 11,370 dan of rice stored in the four banks, 8,039 dan registered in the grain merchants' inventory, and 110,000 dan in the Central Bank, totaling 130,000 dan, which is sufficient for three months." The director of the Provincial Land and Food Department also reported at the Provincial Assembly, "Hangzhou has requested the Ministry of Food to allocate additional grain reserves, ensuring no food shortage for the people." Unexpectedly, four days later, rice prices jumped so drastically. The municipal government has indeed shown its strong determination by ordering the arrest of illegal grain merchants selling on the black market. Mayor Zhou has also stated that the business licenses of grain merchants selling on the black market will be revoked if necessary. Some rice shops selling on the black market have indeed been arrested, but the black market price of rice remains high. Even in the rice shops, only rationed coarse rice is available, with baskets filled with chaff and empty husks. If someone wants to buy rice, they must approach rice merchants for high-priced black market rice.</p>
<p>Reason: High Prices at the Source</p>
<p>Newspapers in Hangzhou have suggested that this is a power struggle between grain merchants and the municipal government. In reality, according to the chairman of the Grain Association, "The government's price limit is too low, and costs are not covered, making it impossible to operate. The stores' rice inventory can only last for a week at most." He also stated, "Merchants will not come if they are beaten, scolded, or lose money." The crucial question now is whether the existing grain reserves are sufficient to meet current needs. According to the officials of the provincial and municipal Land and Food Departments, there is no problem. However, the chairman of the Grain Association only stated that "the price limit is too low, and costs are not covered, making it impossible to operate," and therefore "the stores' rice inventory can only last for a week at most." If the price limit is raised and costs are covered, then it might be possible to sustain operations. From this perspective, the Grain Association intends to raise grain prices, citing high prices at the source. According to the reporter's investigation in production areas such as Xia You, farmers had already sold large quantities of grain to the rice market last fall and winter, leaving very little remaining. Therefore, farmers are not responsible for the increase in grain prices. At the same time, the numbers of rice stocks made public by the director of the Hangzhou government Land and Food Department are not those stored recently. According to insiders, the high price at the production area is in sync with those in the market. The reasons for the current high grain price is thus apparent.</p>
<p>Municipal Government: Decided on a Plan</p>
<p>With such high grain prices, all vegetables and oils have doubled in price, and pork has reached 5,600 yuan per catty. The general public is terrified by these high prices. However, grain merchants continue to argue that costs are too high, urging the government to raise grain prices. Now, it remains to be seen if the government has a solution. It is reported that the municipal government has decided on a plan, which involves establishing grain public sales stores and setting up foreign procurement agencies. This approach would make grain a public enterprise, completely freezing the operations of grain merchants. Another proposal is to continue allocating 1,000 dan of rice from the four banks each day to rice shops for sale at fixed prices. If the latter approach is implemented, the situation will be the same as when the gold rush swept through Hangzhou, with black market sales continuing. If the former approach is implemented, then grain merchants will have no opportunity to profit, and they will naturally soften. However, this all depends on the government's determination.</p>
<p>Grain: Public Sales, etc.</p>
<p>However, establishing grain public sales stores and foreign procurement agencies cannot be achieved overnight. It requires a period of preparation, recruiting business operators, finding store locations, and determining the amount of initial capital. Furthermore, if some unscrupulous rice merchants conspire with the government and use numerous accounts to purchase grain, like they did with gold, the government's controlled rice will eventually run out. At that point, unscrupulous grain merchants can raise their heads again, and their status will be different.</p>
<p>I believe that the current plan should not only focus on investigating the black market for rice, but also on strictly investigating hoarding. If hoarding is discovered, the entire quantity of rice should be confiscated or purchased at the official price, and even a few unscrupulous grain merchants should be severely punished. This is a more thorough approach. Otherwise, the investigation of the black market will never be exhaustive, and those who sell on the black market will have their own channels, with larger companies having more methods and greater power.</p>
<p>We believe that the time when the rice harvest is unavailable has not arrived, and Hangzhou's rice inventory is abundant, so there should be no rice shortage. The reasons for this rice shortage have already been analyzed very clearly, so it only remains to be seen if the government has the determination.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Families of the Victims of the Fubo Ship Case</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>During the initial court hearing for the Fubo-Hai Min ship case today, Wei Wenda, the lawyer hired by Dai Rulin, appeared in court. When Jiao Zongxiao, the engineering officer who survived the Fubo ship disaster, recounted the ordeal, he mentioned that there were approximately sixty or seventy people floating in the water awaiting rescue, and their cries for help were harrowing. At this point, the lawyer suddenly asked Jiao, "How do you know there were sixty or seventy people?" The intention was to overturn the testimony of the only surviving witness from the Fubo, so that Dai Rulin would not have to fight the lawsuit and would naturally win.</p>
<p>Lawyer Wei accused Zheng Guiren, a passenger on the Hai Min, of making baseless statements, which was purely arbitrary.</p>
<p>When Wu Kan, the second officer of the Hai Min, described the collision, Lawyer Wei even said that Wu's account was incorrect and offered many reasons on Wu's behalf. Could Lawyer Wei, who was on land, be more knowledgeable and specific than Wu, who personally experienced the incident? The judge was very perceptive and simply said, "I am questioning him, not you." Consequently, Lawyer Wei sat down in silence.</p>
<p>The initial hearing was only an investigation, so there should have been no need for debate. However, Attorney Wei, in an effort to demonstrate his extraordinary efforts on behalf of the defendant, completely refuted our reasons as families of the victims. We are sharing the experience of attending the hearing with the public and asking for public judgment. (Wang Hangmanjun, Zhu Cai Xiuzhang, Chen Chengli Xia, families of the victims of the Fubo ship) April 29th</p>

<h3>The Zionist Movement</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhou</p>
<p>Recently, we often see reports in the newspapers about the conflicts in Palestine, which are related to the Zionist movement.</p>
<p>Palestine is located on the southern part of the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering Syria to the north, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt to the south, and Jordan to the east. It covers an area of approximately 10,430 square miles and has a population of 1,450,000. It is the holy land of the three major religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</p>
<p>Before the Common Era, Jews established a state there. In 70 AD, after the Roman general Titus conquered Jerusalem, the Jews were expelled from the country. In the late 19th century, Dr. Herzl advocated for the Zionist movement, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The root cause of the current conflict can be traced back to World War I. During that war, Britain, in order to utilize the Arabs, promised them the freedom to establish a state in Palestine after the war. At the same time, it wanted to win over Jews around the world, hoping they would also help the Allied countries. In the famous Balfour Declaration, the British government stated, "His Majesty's Government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object." This dual promise naturally led to conflict.</p>
<p>After World War II, President Truman, recognizing the Nazi persecution and mistreatment of Jews, their displacement and wandering, and the fact that there were 500,000 to 600,000 displaced Jews after the war, helped them return to Palestine to rebuild their country and provided various forms of assistance. As Palestine was originally the homeland of the Jewish ancestors, the Hebrews, and the Bible contains detailed records, even though Jews are currently fewer in number than Arabs, the Jews are qualitatively superior to the Arabs. They used their substantial funds and scientific methods to establish many large enterprises, achieving great accomplishments in education and engineering. There are two important cities, Tel Aviv and Haifa, which have become purely Jewish cities. Fertile land has been bought up by Jews, and prosperous cities are filled with Jews, naturally incurring the resentment of Arabs. The British are also uneasy and use force to suppress them. However, in the United States, not only President Truman, but also public opinion supports the Zionist movement. A public opinion poll was conducted last year, and 78% of those surveyed believed that the country should be rebuilt, 14% opposed it, and the rest had no opinion. Therefore, last August, an editorial in the Mainland News advised the British not to use force, as coercive measures would only make the Jews, who would rather die than submit, more united and determined to fight.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven years ago, the Father of the Nation also supported the Zionist movement. In a letter he wrote to the Shanghai Jewish monthly magazine "Israel's Messenger," he said, "I express my deep sympathy for this Zionist movement, which is one of the most important movements of modern times. All democrats should do their best to help you restore the ancient country in history."</p>
<p>"In blood and fire, the Jewish state will be reborn!" This is the song sung by the Jewish secret army, the Haganah. The Haganah currently has around 70,000 members operating in the Middle East. They will likely be able to rebuild their homeland in the Holy Land.</p>

<h3>An Interview with Female Painter Gu Qingyao</h3>
<p>— Nie Guangdi</p>
<p>The arts scene is flourishing today, but it is rare to find someone like Ms. Gu Qingyao from Fujian who is exceptional in poetry, calligraphy, and painting. I had long admired her reputation as a painter in Suzhou, and yesterday, through a friend's introduction, I visited her residence. Ms. Gu was casually receiving guests. The room contained desks and tables covered with stationery and silk, and three ancient zithers hung on the walls, suggesting her fondness for music. She showed me several recent works, all characterized by clarity, antiquity, and elegance, combining meticulousness and freedom. Her style was both lofty and refined, with a grand and detailed composition. The brushwork was vigorous, and the ink was rich and layered, demonstrating her mastery of the styles of Da Dizi and Xin Luo, along with her understanding of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Her work was far beyond what ordinary artists could achieve. She inscribed on her landscape painting: "I still indulge in my poetic madness behind closed doors, my ink gradually aging and deepening as I grow old. I refuse to compromise with the current trends, but pay homage to Qing Xiang with my lofty integrity." She also inscribed on her imitation of Shitao's landscape painting: "Wanting to pick up the scorched paulownia zither, the peaks are cold on all sides. Fragrant herbs hide in the rock creepers, and ancient trees grow gnarled knots. Mountain spirits are driving ten thousand carts, and pine pollen falls on the cloud tops. As the sun sets, the Chu traveler's heart is stirred, but who will awaken the summoned soul?"</p>
<p>Ms. Gu told me that these paintings were also intended for the exhibition of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association. I asked to see her poetry and calligraphy manuscripts, and found a recent inscription she wrote for Lu Minggang's "Flower-Filled Good Fortune Studio Pledge Picture Golden Tower Melody": "The flames of war spread, yet there is still a sense of liberation. Like Fang Weng, I harbor righteous indignation, maintain purity, and worry about the country. My only habits are books and paintings, cherishing the rice-measuring cup and yellow flowers. Who would have expected that smoke and clouds would bring disaster, no less than the grief of Donghua Temple? I sigh, caressing the ashes for ten years. Alas, what a fierce fire! Reassembling the coral iron net, the clanging of bells and the cold gold inscription enhance the beauty. The paper and silk preserve the pure and unblemished aspirations, accustomed to loving the plum blossoms that stretch across the stones. The way remains the same, and the room is filled with the fragrance of ink. From now on, I will have thousands of axes of books in the library, treasuring the flowers like jade, and indulging in this obsession." I have observed the works of her disciples, and their brushwork in trees and rocks all conforms to the principles of painting, which is truly remarkable. Having met Ms. Gu, I now understand the source of her teaching abilities.</p>
<p>My friend told me that Ms. Gu's character is even more admirable than her painting skills. I replied: "Of course, I have already learned this from reading her poetry and calligraphy. In these degenerate times, I did not expect to find someone with such upright character as Ms. Gu. People are known by their art, and art is elevated by character. Only Ms. Gu can be said to truly deserve this praise."</p>
<h3>Rainy Day</h3>
<p>— Lan Hui</p>
<p>After a few days of sunshine, just when people were feeling warm and cozy, a bit lazy; this morning, it suddenly started drizzling again. Walking in the rain, I can't suppress a feeling of intimacy.</p>
<p>When I lived in the countryside, I had a special interest: I loved walking barefoot with an umbrella on rainy mornings. Looking down, I would stroll on the stone-paved path, washed extremely clean by the rain, or slide along the muddy edges of the fields; on one hand, I would watch my feet being soaked and turned very white, or being covered in yellow mud, and on the other hand, I would quietly listen to the sound of raindrops hitting the umbrella. Then, I would feel an indescribable ease and joy. At this moment, my mind would be as clean as if it had been washed, and all the annoying thoughts of weekdays would suddenly disappear; and often, the literary inspirations and poetic lines that I had long sought would flow out like a clear stream.</p>
<p>I wrote down those natural and pure poetic verses, and I also took the rain scene in the fields of the morning as part of my best memories.</p>
<p>The spring rain calls out to the green vitality within the soil. Who has visited the spring fields the morning after a spring rain? Seeing those green seedlings emerging from the soil, filled with gratitude, gently trembling and carrying water droplets, how can you reject that joy of growth?</p>
<p>The summer rain expresses the intensity of vitality: it comes abruptly and violently, and leaves decisively. That magnificent beauty makes you feel both fear and joy at the same time: it reminds people of the clear sky after the rain, and the rainbow in the sky.</p>
<p>And melancholy and longing accompany the autumn rain. Boundless, faint, as if the endless autumn rain, tempts boundless reveries, giving endless flavors to affectionate people of longing.</p>
<p>Naturally, the winter rain makes people sad. However, aren't the hibernating insects accumulating energy for spring? Doesn't the sorrowful winter rain also cry for the approaching end of winter's life? ...</p>
<p>This year, spring is late - no, it is winter reluctant to leave late; still crying winter rain in the days that should be spring. But, why should we despair, or even doubt whether spring will come? Look, hasn't the withered grass in the corner already secretly changed color? ....</p>

<h3>Pine Needles</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>In "Baopuzi," there is such a record:</p>
<p>"During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han Dynasty, a hunter in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person without clothes and covered in black hair. The hunter wanted to catch him, but the person leapt over pits and valleys, flying as if soaring, impossible to reach far. Therefore, he secretly watched where he was, encircled and caught him. It was a woman. When asked, she said, 'I was originally a palace woman of Qin. Hearing that the bandits from Guandong were coming, the King of Qin surrendered, the palaces were burned, I fled in shock to the mountains, hungry and with nothing to eat, I was about to starve to death. An old man taught me to eat pine needles and pine nuts. At first, it was bitter and astringent, but later I became accustomed to it, and so I did not feel hunger or thirst, not cold in winter, and not hot in summer.' Calculating that this woman was a palace woman of Ziying, the Prince of Qin, it was more than three hundred years until the time of Emperor Cheng. So they brought her back and fed her grain. At first, she vomited at the smell of grain, but after several days she calmed down. After about two years, the hair on her body fell off, she became old and died. If she had not been found, she would have become an immortal."</p>
<p>Reading this "myth" made me think of a fact that I had experienced.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1943, after the enemy's large-scale sweep in northern Jiangsu, I temporarily took refuge on the edge of a water marsh. I was robbed several times by stray soldiers, and I lost all my clothes, leaving only a single pair of pants. I crossed the enemy area and crossed the river to southern Anhui; but in just a few days, the enemy cavalry arrived again. Because I was unfamiliar with the place, there was nowhere for me to hide, so I went to the mountains to find a hiding place.</p>
<p>When describing the terrain of southern Anhui, there is originally a statement that "there is no three feet of flat land." Once you enter the mountains, there is a possibility that the mountain stones will hurt your nose. All you see are continuous mountains and high hills, as if the mountain gods deliberately deployed a "mountain formation," making it impossible for the people who have thrown themselves in to escape forever.</p>
<p>At that time, I found a valley and used the surrounding rocks as my protective shell; but there was still a line of sky exposed above, so I took off a jacket and tied the four corners to the branches, thinking that this could block out this terrifying world.</p>
<p>But in fact, terror still followed the gunshots and shells.</p>
<p>The sharp sound of bullets and the heavy sound of shells flew over my head, and although my body couldn't help but tremble, I could barely control my legs, preventing them from leaving this valley and running elsewhere.</p>
<p>"If I am destined to die, then this valley is a natural coffin."</p>
<p>I thought like this, thinking, very painfully, second by second.</p>
<p>From noon until night, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, but another serious threat began to be added to me. - That is hunger.</p>
<p>The night wind brought the frightened cries of distant birds. I knew that in the mountains, there must be many suffering people hiding, and they were suffering the same way. Where could I find food? There was no way. I could only look for readily available "food" on the pine trees around me. Handfuls of pine needles were continuously sent into my mouth. At first, I felt a little bitter, but later I felt it was fragrant and sweet.</p>
<p>The war continued for five days. I ate pine needles for five days. Almost all the pine needles around me had been picked. By the sixth day, nature had returned to its original peace, and the enemy had retreated. I climbed out of the valley, feeling dizzy and unable to distinguish directions. Looking into the distance, I saw someone leaning against a rock, so I quickly walked forward, preparing to ask for directions. Who knew that when I looked closer, it turned out to be a corpse. His face was pale, and there was a pool of blood on the ground. He was probably killed by stray bullets. After walking a few more steps, I saw another person lying next to a tree. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a corpse as well, but there were no wounds on this corpse, and no blood was seen on the ground. I guessed that this was probably caused by the double attack of fright and hunger. I looked at this corpse, feeling both sorrow and deep self-congratulation, congratulating myself that I was able to survive these five days entirely by relying on pine needles; otherwise, I would have been companions with the corpse in front of me.</p>
<p>Baopuzi said that eating pine nuts can "become an immortal," so even though I ate pine needles for five days and did not become an immortal, I have already explored the path to "immortality."</p>
<h3>Zhou Yushan's Solo Exhibition of Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongyi</p>
<p>Zhou Yushan, the owner of Qiugu Studio, held a solo calligraphy exhibition at the Great New Company. I accepted Mr. Zhou's invitation to visit, and there were more than a hundred pieces on display, a dazzling array, beautiful and captivating. Among various styles of calligraphy, seal script (篆體) was the most prevalent. Upon a comprehensive review of the variations in his seal script, the "iron wire seal script" (鐵綫篆) type best captured its essence. Iron wire seal script is not easy to create; one must have a meticulous mind to conform to the rules. Mr. Zhou's two large pieces, the "Former and Latter Expeditions" (前後出師表) by Zhuge Liang, had numerous characters, even strokes, as fine as autumn down, as dense as a spider web. Whether viewed closely or from afar, they appeared clear as woven brocade, a testament to his masterful brushwork and wrist strength. There were also many other seal script works such as oracular bone script and couplets from the Zhou Maogong Ding (周毛公鼎). In addition, there were eight old works from ten years ago: 1. Xia Yu's Goulou Stele (夏禹岣嶁碑), 2. Yin Ruins Oracle Bone Script (殷虛甲骨文), 3. Zhou Maogong Ding (周毛公鼎), 4. Kuaiji Mountain Stone Inscriptions (會稽山石刻文), 5. Han Kaiwu Temple Xingshi Shinto Stone Gate Inscriptions (漢開毋廟興始神道石闕文), 6. Wei Zhengshi Three-Script Stone Classics (魏正始三體石經), 7. Wu Tianfa Divine Discussion Three-Fragment Stele (吳天發神議三段殘碑), 8. Tang Li Yangbing City God Temple Text (唐李陽冰城隍廟文). These eight works, spanning from Xia to Tang, contained historical significance and were listed as excellent in the National Celebrities' Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Yu stele is hidden in Hengshan, the seal script is special, and the characters are difficult to identify; although there are three interpretations since ancient times, there are many doubtful characters, and it is rarely copied because its style of writing is different from all other seal scripts. I say that Mr. Zhou's iron wire seal script is elegant and outstanding, like Ouyang Xun's characters, and Yu stele's majestic is like Yan Lugong's characters, both styles have their own wonderful points.</p>
<p>I also saw a piece of regular and running script intermingled, staggered and quite beautified, all collected Yan style characters, it can be said that Mr. Zhou can use the spirit of Yan characters to admire Yu stele's shape, of course, the shape and spirit are all in place. Although a few of his oracle bone script characters are a little thin, this may be due to the difference in the stele version? If recent works are compared to those from ten years ago, they are even more similar. Recently, there have been more and more calligraphy couplets collected from oracle bone script, most of the strokes are like knife cuts, because at that time the characters were carved on oracle bones, the beginning and end have sharp edges, not necessarily uniform at both ends, like iron wire seal script, iron wire seal script is like iron wire, oracle bone script is like bamboo silk, the brush is just between rigidity and softness, the style is different. Among the eight works, the two ends of the Three-Script Stone Classics are too sharp, and the middle seems a little wide, so it falls into weakness, like the Wanfang orchid leaf style. I often say that Xue Shanggong's bronze tripods are not as good as Ruan Yuan's bronze tripods, also because Xue's style is sharp at both ends, and Ruan's style is not sharp, just like the seal script engraved on the bronze ware that day. I would like to ask experts for their opinions on this.</p>
<h3>Shuangyu Xuan Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Gang Weifa</p>
<p>Bodhisattva Crown</p>
<p>The cool moon in the sky is so round, don’t be careless in the cold of the award. The wild geese are crossing, someone misses you in the middle of the night. The autumn wind keeps blowing, and should pass the south bank of the Yangtze River. Don't hesitate, the returning boat has not yet returned.</p>
<p>Jianlan - Inscription on the Painting of Jiexi Ze Pan Walking and Chanting</p>
<p>The rivers and plains are boundless, and the white labor is never-ending; checking the parting feelings, how many times the west wind geese do not come. The heart is still there, the clouds at the end of the sky are long and hazy; walking and chanting on the edge of the swamp, the smoke willows and the setting sun have arrived today.</p>
<p>Deep and Far Stream Gauze - A Gift</p>
<p>Crouching like lice in trousers, the threads are intricate; how many times have new tears been seen in Xinting! Striking the oars to cross the river to embrace Zu Ti, hearing the sword dance to invite Liu Kun; looking forward to the ambition to despise the autumn clouds.</p>
<p>浣溪紗 - Lonely Goose</p>
<p>Leaving the flock, the clouds rest more, the frost and wind are still the autumn of the old year; who is my companion in the clear and cold? I am afraid that missing people will add more tears of parting, I should hide my shadow in the deserted continent; I dare not pass the high-rise building in tears.</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— Gong Banqian</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 501</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Your department?" Tsurumi started to question leisurely.</p>
<p>"The Eleventh Brigade, Second Squad, Third Team, First-Class Service." As he spoke, he stood up and saluted, but Tsurumi pressed him down and told him to sit down:</p>
<p>"You went to the pier this morning to welcome Miss Nakamura, presumably arranged by your superior?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there was a notice from the embassy last night... The service is not very clear... It is said that it should be hosted by the military, because the comfort service in North China is directly handled by the military. But this morning, the reception of the two gentlemen was not directly notified by North China, but was telegraphed to the embassy by the Lord... This is Mr. Tian, the Ambassador..."</p>
<p>"Understood." Tsurumi disliked this person being too verbose. "Then, the arrangement of the Banzai Hall was also designated by the military?"</p>
<p>"The service is not very clear..." The service thought for a moment "...But according to the situation, I am afraid it was designated by the embassy."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"The military has never used the Banzai Hall to entertain officials of all parties, departments, and levels."</p>
<p>"Oh," Tsurumi did not want to get involved in side issues because of time constraints. "There is one thing I presume you can still remember - this morning when I heard Miss Nakamura get into the car, there was a ragged young man hiding next to the car, you probably saw him?"</p>
<p>"Oh……" The service thought for a moment, as if he did not remember this morning's events very clearly. "...Yes,...I remember: there was a beggar; there are many beggars of this kind in Shanghai. It's simply professionalized: in parking lots everywhere, or temporary parking places, there are these kinds of beggars who automatically watch over the cars for people, wanting to beg for some tips. At the same time, they are professional petty thieves. If you don't let them watch over the car, or don't give them tips, they will definitely steal something from the car, or damage the car somewhat..."</p>
<p>"Understood," Tsurumi interrupted this guy's report again. "Did you hear the beggar speak at that time?"</p>
<p>"...It seems I heard... I can't say for sure... Perhaps I thought he was begging for tips at the time, so I didn't pay much attention."</p>
<p>"Very good," these two words were Tsurumi's common saying, not necessarily used according to their usual meaning. "Did you pay attention to the beggar's time of arrival and departure and traces?... "</p>
<p>"This question...!" The service saw that Tsurumi's questions were gradually intensifying step by step, and only then did he realize that he was being interrogated and that he himself was in a position of suspicion, so while answering, he left his seat and stood straight to the side. "...Regarding this beggar, the service really did not pay attention at the time, because there are too many things of this kind in Shanghai. However, the mistake of the service's oversight is unavoidable...!" This service was very understanding and could also talk.</p>
<p>"Please sit down, " Tsurumi felt uneasy: his original intention was to elicit the truth from the service in a "chat" manner, but he was too hasty for a moment, making the steps and words of the questioning overflow the originally planned scope, resulting in somewhat of a stalemate, so he still gestured for the service to sit down and talk, intending to ease the atmosphere somewhat. "Please understand, I am not interrogating you for any suspicion,... The reason is that an unexpected, untoward state of affairs has occurred, and we suspect the beggar, so we invited you to talk about it. We have no questions about you..."</p>
<p>"The service understands very well," the service did not sit down. "The service seems to remember that before the two gentlemen got into the car, the service did not pay attention and did not see him. By the time I saw him, it was already before the car started, and I did not take him seriously... This is the truth!"</p>

<h3>Orphan Zhu Aibo</h3>
<p>— Newsboy</p>
<p>Fu Fugen, a seventeen-year-old boy, had just committed suicide out of shame and regret for the difficulty of making a living and for burdening his sixty-year-old father with the burden of supporting the family. Zhu Aibo, this fifteen-year-old unfortunate girl, took the same path two days ago.</p>
<p>We know that the competition for survival is originally extremely serious, but it seems to only apply to adults who have entered society. However, today, among the endless urban tragedies, there are even children. This is truly tragic.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't know why children, who should be innocent and carefree, are so despairing about life, and after despair, rush to death so resolutely. This cannot be seen as a passive attitude. Our children are not afraid of death and are able to do something and are ambitious.</p>
<p>Imagine a seventeen-year-old boy being able to ask the foreign concessions bureau for a license to sell newspapers and magazines to earn commissions to maintain his livelihood. Imagine a fifteen-year-old girl wanting to continue her studies without relying on her family to steal money. This spirit of seeking survival is truly admirable.</p>
<p>After the blind girl Rudel, the heroine of Diderot, regained her sight, she committed suicide out of despair for seeing this ugly world. She had not yet truly touched the hardness of reality, but it is enough to make us close the book and sigh. Zhu Aibo, this young girl, truly came from real life. Her suicide is nothing less than the loudest accusation against current society.</p>
<p>No matter how bad the times develop, don't let such tragic results befall our children. If our society feels that there is no way out even for children, then there really is no way out.</p>
<p>Please listen, girls like Zhu Aibo will also say sadly: "Living in this society, it's so boring." This has more analytical and research value than a million conceptual papers.</p>
<p>May there be a ray of light in our society for children like Zhu Aibo to live on!</p>
<h3>Mozi and Confucius</h3>
<p>— Zhang Sheng</p>
<p>If I had been born in a dynasty before the Qing Dynasty, I would certainly not have dared to criticize Confucius, nor would I often mention Mozi. Confucius's theories were not allowed to be criticized by people at that time, and Mozi's ideas were not advocated by scholars at that time. Therefore, Confucius's door was crowded with visitors, and his name shook the four seas; but Mozi's door was deserted, and his name was unknown ten miles away! Now, I will cite two examples as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mozi Stops Chu from Attacking Song</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, Chu, claiming hegemony, wanted to attack Song after obtaining Longshu. Upon hearing this, Mozi went to Chu overnight, saw the King of Chu and asked him to dispel his original intention. However, his minister Gongshuban refused to accept it and fought with him for a long time. In the end, Gongshuban lost and agreed to stop attacking Song, so the people of Song were spared disaster.</p>
<p>(2) "Disrespectful to the Master"</p>
<p>During the Zhou Dynasty, one day, a certain military commander and his entourage visited Confucius. When they entered the door, both of them bowed, but the commander's entourage accidentally looked up. The next day, he was dismissed from his post, and the charge was "disrespectful to the Master."</p>
<p>Reading the above two short stories, you can know the thoughts of the two of them. Mozi is peaceful and worldly; Confucius is "follow the monarch."</p>
<p>Mozi advocated universal love and non-aggression, and promoted active reading - dynamic research and white-motion observation - the science he studied before, such as astronomy, teaching, etc., has now been realized, it can be seen that he was not blindly doing it at that time, but was researching based on ideas.</p>
<p>Confucius advocated the doctrine of loyalty and filial piety that "a monarch wants a subject to die, he must die; a father wants a son to perish, he must perish." He only advocated loyalty and filial piety of abandoning delusion. Now, we should first distinguish right from wrong and dedicate ourselves to the country and honor our parents. He believes that reading for fame and martial arts is to die in the battlefield for ancestors. If this is really the case, then the students studying and the soldiers fighting have lost their true meaning.</p>
<h3>How to Listen to Symphonies?</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>"Symphony" is the crystallization of music art that has reached the highest level in both consciousness and technique, so it is not easy to understand without considerable appreciation ability. The level of music appreciation in our country is generally low. Except for a few "connoisseurs," most people feel half-understood or completely clueless when listening to a symphony performance.</p>
<p>To understand the content of a symphony, judge the merits of the performance, and understand and appreciate the fun, you must have knowledge in various aspects:</p>
<p>Regarding the method of performance, you must understand the types of instruments, timbre, individual functions, and special expressive power, etc. For example, the tone of the violin is gorgeous, affectionate, gentle, and beautiful; the tone of the cello is deep and enthusiastic; the tone of the pipe is simple and sad, full of pastoral flavor; the tone of the French horn is solemn and majestic, and has a sad feeling. ......</p>
<p>Regarding the form of the piece, you must understand the form of the music. Although the listener does not have to be a musician, he must at least be familiar with the form of a symphony: it is a large-scale piece of music played by an orchestra. The entire piece usually contains three or four movements: The first movement uses the allegro sonata form, the second movement uses the slow ternary form or variations, the third movement uses the allegretto minuet (Minuet) or scherzo (large ternary form), and the fourth movement uses the allegro rondo form.</p>
<p>Regarding the personality and style of the composer, you must have considerable knowledge of music history and have the ability to distinguish auditorily. For example, when listening to Beethoven's "Heroic Symphony" (No. 3), in addition to understanding the magnificent spirit, you must also understand the composer's political views, democratic ideas, and motivation for composing. For example, when listening to his "Fate Symphony" (No. 5), in addition to understanding the mood of suggestion and "fate" to end victory, you must also understand the composer's motivation and hope.</p>
<p>Regarding the types and schools of music, you must know the general outline, such as the difference between "homophonic music" and "polyphonic music": the former is the beauty of "harmony" (Harmony) lining, and the latter is the beauty of "counterpoint" interlacing. The difference between "absolute music" and "program music"; the former expresses abstraction, and the content and form are inseparable; the latter has specific titles to indicate the content, or write about love, or express emotions. Furthermore, the styles, strengths, and representative figures of the two major schools of music—the classical school and the romantic school—should also be known in general.</p>
<p>If you have the above-mentioned knowledge, you already have considerable appreciation ability, and of course you can get a lot of sublime fun from listening to symphony performances. As for wanting to be an excellent music critic, you must do a research effort on the entire content of the piece before the performance.</p>
<h3>Prison Overcrowding</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>According to reports, the prison, which was once sparsely populated due to amnesty, is now full again, and there are quite a few heroes who have committed numerous crimes.</p>
<p>To say something that doesn't make sense but makes sense, prison is the final destination for offenders; after being released from prison, they wander the streets again, so they "rehabilitate" and return to their old business, and as a result, they are arrested and re-enter prison.</p>
<p>Some say: "These people do not engage in proper business, and going to prison is not a big deal. They are harmful to the country and society and should be shot." But this is probably difficult to do. Moreover, those who are harmful to the country and society are not just these people!</p>
<h3>Manchukuo National Anthem</h3>
<p>— Bai Yi</p>
<p>After the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese invaders used Puyi, the deposed emperor of the Qing Dynasty, to establish the puppet state of Manchukuo in my Northeast. The puppet took the stage and made all kinds of ugly appearances. Yesterday, a guest told me: After the establishment of Manchukuo, it also compiled the so-called "national anthem" and forced the compatriots in the Northeast to sing it. The words are absurd, and the writing is not fluent. I don't know who wrote it. The song goes: "Within the heaven and earth, there is a new Manchukuo. The new Manchukuo is the new world; following heaven and standing on earth, there is no suffering and no worry. Creating our country, there is only love, and no hatred. The people number thirty million, and even if we work hard, we will get freedom. We value etiquette and uphold benevolence; we cultivate ourselves. Our families are in order, and our country is governed; what more can we ask for? We will assimilate with the world in the near future, and we will become desolate with the heaven and earth in the distant future!" At that time, the students in the Northeast all regarded Puyi's betrayal of his country and serving the enemy as a great shame and humiliation to China. Therefore, someone once changed the false national anthem to: "Within the heaven and earth, there is a big steamed bun; take the big steamed bun and feed it to the dog! The sky and the earth are full of bitterness and suffering! Creating this country, there is no love, only hatred! The people are a mixture (referring to the three nationalities of China, Japan, and Korea living together in the false Manchukuo) and even if they increase tenfold, they will not be free! What etiquette and courtesy is there that anyone still cultivates! The family is not in order, and the country is not governed; when will we raise our heads? We will assimilate with Korea in the near future, and we will be like the Jews in the distant future!" For a time, it was known to every household and sung everywhere, which shows that the compatriots outside the pass at that time had a full understanding of the truth about the false Manchukuo. It is a pity that they were under the iron fist of the enemy and could not do anything.</p>
<h3>New Interpretation of Diplomatic Terms</h3>
<p>— Mi Xilin</p>
<p>The term "diplomat," in English, is "Diplomat," and according to historical research in diplomacy, it originated from Rome. Back then, diplomats were not as envied as they are today, especially in terms of living conditions, with strict limitations and many constraints.</p>
<p>Diplomacy often involves state secrets that must not be divulged. Therefore, European diplomats at the time were not allowed to bring their wives, to prevent the leakage of confidential information. This caused hardship for the imperial envoys. So, to reward officials dealing with foreign affairs, the government, in addition to lavish clothing and generous salaries, also allowed them to bring cooks to compensate for this spiritual deficiency with material enjoyment. But who would be willing to abandon their families and go to a foreign land? Therefore, Western historians express the "diplomat" of that time with a formula:</p>
<p>D is the diplomat (Diplomat), C is the cook (Cook), W is the wife (Wife).</p>
<p>Today, diplomats bringing their wives to banquets has become an international diplomatic etiquette, but bringing "cooks" has decreased. Therefore, modern Western historians say that the above formula should be changed to D W C.</p>

<p>Male A: How old is your new girlfriend?</p>
<p>Male B: She said she has spent thirty-two summers! But later I heard that she spent most of her life in the Arctic.</p>
<h3>Eventful Autumn</h3>
<p>— Jiang Juling</p>
<p>A friend told me that he has been receiving many invitations recently, either for a "celebration of his mother's fiftieth birthday" or a "joyful occasion of his young child's full month." I said he was fortunate to have such good fortune; couldn't he "feast heartily" when he "spares the time to attend"?</p>
<p>But he said that these hosts are all suffering from a "cash shortage" and resorted to this as a last resort. I then suddenly understood and could not help but smile knowingly. I said this is "autumn wind in spring," and my friend said these years are truly an "eventful autumn."</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>He had a letter of introduction from the chief secretary of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Commander X had even scribbled two lines of thick black characters on the envelope with flamboyant strokes. Moreover, on his first visit, he had met Director Xiong, who was very polite and did not put on any airs. However, he still couldn't get the car! It wasn't that Director Xiong was deliberately making things difficult for him, but that there were too many people asking for cars, and each had a great background. Some were even people with great wealth and power. The business cards they presented would normally be more than enough to control this transport director who was only paid at the rank of lieutenant colonel. They could enter the director's office without waiting to be invited or hand over an official document and wait for the director to reply on the spot. This was something Lao Zhu couldn't do. Therefore, he could only wait again and again.</p>
<p>Today, he felt he could no longer endure it. He made a do-or-die decision to demand a definite "yes" or "no" answer from Director Xiong, who wielded considerable power.</p>
<p>The guests gradually left, and the junior staff in the large office to the left began to go out for dinner. Lao Zhu recognized this as an opportunity and suddenly pushed open the small door leading to the director's office, walking in with a beaming face.</p>
<p>Director Xiong didn't remember him at all and looked up with a puzzled gaze.</p>
<p>"Sorry! Director Xiong, I'm Zhu Zhaonian from the new planning group. It's about the car!" Lao Zhu spoke first.</p>
<p>"..." The person at the desk showed an impatient expression.</p>
<p>"Commander X has already approved it. We also talked about it last time!" Lao Zhu hurriedly added, sitting down on a small chair next to him.</p>
<p>The other's expression then softened somewhat.</p>
<p>"We have been waiting..."</p>
<p>The telephone on the desk rang, and Director Xiong's ear was stolen by someone else. Lao Zhu could only swallow the unfinished words, waiting blankly. This time, the phone call was particularly lengthy. Although Director Xiong said "goodbye" and "I will definitely take care of it later" to the other party several times, the other party kept chattering on and on. Lao Zhu glared at the oily black telephone line, really wanting to tear it off.</p>
<p>"This job is impossible to do! Damn it!" The young and vigorous Director Xiong threw down the telephone receiver angrily and said in a fit of rage.</p>
<p>This was too unfavorable for Lao Zhu! He thought that talking to the other party about his own affairs at this time would be like hitting a nail head-on. However, not talking was impossible. (61)</p>
