<p>〔本報南京二日電〕參政會對和平提案之決議案，業於二日下午第十九次會中通過，此爲此次大會重要收獲之一，此項決議係根據一日晚特種審委會擬具之審查意見及其辦法三點（見昨日本報），當主席宣讀審查意見全文後，未及半分鐘，即無異議通過，會塲內鼓掌聲歷一分鐘許，孔庚雖曾發言，但對該案之通過未生影響。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕參政會第四屆第三次大會，二日下午圓滿閉幕，本屆大會召開之日，正值國內局勢動盪不安，全國人民渴望和平之時，大會代表全國民意，制訂和平方案，爲本屆本會最大之收穫。會中通過提案四百餘件，其中以關於財政，經濟者爲最多，足以反映安定民生實爲目前當務之急，然各參政員僉認必須獲得和平，然後始可安定經濟，改魯民生，是以渠等　求和平之心甚爲迫切，爲呼籲和平提出之方案達廿餘件，經召開全體審查會一次及特種審查會二次，並起草審查意見提付大會，卒獲全體熱烈擁護通過。大會宣告閉幕，惟未另舉行閉幕式，僅由林虎代表主席團致閉幕詞及鄒樹文代表全體參政員致詞，二氏强調此次大會中心工作，厥在謀取和平，以期在和平中求建設，以建設保障和平。</p>

<h3>大會主席團代表　林虎致閉幕詞　鄒樹文代表全體致詞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕參政會第四屆第三次大會，二日晚閉幕，主席團推林虎代表主席團致閉幕詞，大意如次：</p>
<p>今日第四屆第三次大會圓滿完成，主席團囑本人代表致詞，本會使命在集思廣益，團結全國力量，抗戰期間，則協助政府從事抗戰，勝利以後，憲法實施以前，則協助政府從事建國。當前建國路上發生障礙，此陣礙如不袪除，建國工作無由進行，故排紛解爭，謀取和平，實爲首要之圖。</p>
<p>必獲得和平而後可以安定經濟，改善民生，發展敎育，建立憲政。此次大會中心工作，厥在謀取和平，各同人提出二十議案，經經大會盡一日之力，開全體審查會，復由特種委員會開會兩次，所擬方案，頃已通過，此項方案實寫和平之鑰，預料各方如有良好之反應。其第三項，大會旣以其責任付之主席團及駐會委員會，主席團及駐會委員會當本大會之精神，匪勉努力，期不負大會之使命，以達到和平之實現。</p>
<p>此次大會各同人所提議案，約計四首餘件，充分反映全國民衆之要求與意向，大會所爲決議，已權衡輕重緩急，分別請求政府辦理，吾人自信必皆於政府施政　有所裨益，　　政府虛心者慮，分別採納，一一見之施行，主席團及駐會委員會亦必根據本會職權，隨時盡其督促與檢討之。</p>
<p>大會休會以後，各同人分返地方，希望一本大會精神，隨時隨處努力以盡本會同人應盡之職責，凡中央政府種種設施所影響於地方者，爲良爲否，或利或害，均盼切實注意。關於地方弊害，民間痛苦，尤盼詳爲者察，協同地方民意機關，設法爲之解除。其有需要轉達中樞者，亦請隨時詳函駐會委員會，以備斟酌建議政府。</p>
<p>本會自廿七年七月成立至今，將近九年，以往對於國家之貢獻，人所共睹，現在距離十二月廿五日召開國民大會之期雖只半年，但各位同人均負社會信望，對於國家興亡，永有責任，希望繼續努力，以躋我國家於當强康樂之域，敬祝健康。</p>
<p>繼由參政員鄒樹文代表全體致詞，說明參會成立將近十載，向以促進民主，早日召開國大爲主旨，現國大已於去歲召開，年底即可行憲，功成者身退，代表民意之本會，當將職責轉交他日成立之民意機關。鄒氏繼指出由於政治，經濟，敎育等等之不安定，我國國際地位日趨低微，人民生活日見下降，爲今之計，應在安定中求進步，對經濟，金融及敎育，皆應審愼處理。本屆大會，曾就上述問題獻其一得之愚，盼當局能採納實施，而對學潮問題處理時，尤應鄭重。抗戰工作固困難，和平建設亦匪易，盼全國上下咸能奉行節約，努力建設，以鞏固和平基礎，我人應於和平中求建設，建設中保障和平於最短期內，促使和平實現。鄒氏結論謂：求仁者得仁，求和平而終得和平，求建設者終得建設，自力更生，努力以赴，上述目的，當不難圓滿達成，國家民族當不難臻於康樂。</p>

<h3>徵用豪富財產　參會通過伍純武提案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕參政會二日晨十八次會通過財經提案中，重要者有：（一）陳賡雅提請政府徵借私人鉅額游資及國外存款，以挽經濟危機案。（二）羅萬倬提安定物價，平衡預算，停發紙幣，以維民生案，（三）伍純武根請政府立下最大決心，本有錢出錢原則，徵用豪富財產，以挽救當前經濟破產案。</p>
<h3>財部答覆參會質詢　匯率未考慮調整　對美借欵只限用於建設</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕財部，於參政員鄒樹文有關外匯質詢之言面答覆中，聲明政府現尚未考慮調整匯率，據稱：「查政府對變動匯率，向極審愼，惟因國內物價繼續上漲，致使匯率與自然水準相去餃遠；爲鼓勵出口，並顧及華僑匯款利益計，不得不於適當時襪酌爲調整。自上次匯率調整後，出口貿易顯有進步，本年二三月間華僑匯款亦較上年底增加幾達一倍，現仍注意平穩物價，尚未者量調整匯率」。又財部對吳參政員健陶所詢穩定貨幣問題，答覆如下：「穩定貨幣，確屬當前切要之圖，年前政府一面配合國民經濟發展之需要改進租稅制度，增加正常收入；一面加强管制金融，督導資金運用，以協助生產盡設。同時在租稅之外運用公債及物資政策，吸收社會遊資。凡此措施均在企求平衡收支，收縮通貨，吾人確信此種措施尚屬正確，推行不遺餘力，如國內秩序安定，生產循序進行，則幣值自可臻於穩定也」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕財部答覆參政員質詢之書面文件中，對我國過去舉辦外債情形及目下商借外債情形，曾作如下之報告：「職時舉借美金八億七千萬元，英金五千八百萬鎊，此係約訂之最高額，實際當以動用數計算。依此，則戰時英金外債僅一四，八四四，七七三鎊，美金七八六，三四三，五八〇，八五元，戰後舉借之外債美金一二一，四五〇，〇〇〇元，加幣六千萬。此類債款現陸續動用中。目前已動用者僅美金五，一二二，二四一，八二元，加幣一九，四九六，四九一，九九元，（太平洋美軍剩餘物資讓予數在外，因此項物資價價若干及與中美戰時相互租借法案之淸算有關，數字尚未確定。）現在進行中之任務，在外債方面，爲五億美元借款，此項借款依照最初中美雙方洽商，均同意限用於經濟建設方面。美國進出口銀行內國際貿易關係，及戰後世界經濟之復興，對於國際實款無不索取借款之用途，幷非僅對我國借款之特有條件，與我國國格似無影響。至自給自足之決心，在目前事實上或難實現，但吾人不能不有此抱負，茍能全國上下共守此旨，比項目的亦可逐漸達到」。</p>
<h3>高雄魚商奇遇購魚剖得人屍</h3>
<p>或係伏波艦遭難官兵</p>
<p>〔本報台北訊〕本省近發生一魚腹中出現人屍之奇開，緣有高雄魚商林天爽，某日在住里漁市塲購得大沙魚一條，經携返家中加以剖解時，竟赫然發現魚腹中臥有死屍一具，貌似日本人，年約三四十歲左右，面目差可辨認，左前膊且殘存有草黃色之衣袖半隻，一時矗動附近居民，爭相往觀，據測十九係舟船傾覆致遭沙魚吞噬者，或猜係伏波軍艦遭難官兵之一，因身份無法辨明，刻已埋於住里鎭公所公墓中</p>
<h3>徐傅霖月底赴粵</h3>
<p>府委令發表後即晋京</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕徐傅霖昨告記者：本月底擬赴粵一行，因廣東支部之工作急待開展，預定留旬日左右即可接眷返滬。府委之職，雖因黨內之敦勸而接受，但尚待政府明令發表後，再行晋京，開除黨員之舉，山於不得已，惟開除並非永久性質，彼此有十餘年之歷史，只須對方能撤消革新委員會，不念舊恨，則經過合法手續後，仍能恢復黨籍。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨副主席伍憲子除對內爭事採超然態度外，亦未決定是否接受府委之職·上月三十日該當組委會特派戢翼翹，洪少植，李聖策代表前往敦勸，伍氏當表示短期內擬返香港，對府委事不作肯定答覆。又李大明近有電來滬，謂對該黨內部糾紛，亦如伍　子之超然中立。</p>
<h3>綏靖區考取縣長十八人分發蘇省</h3>

<h3>迪化昨地震</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化二日電〕二日晨五時五分，迪化發生地震，屋瓦震盪，歷時三十八秒始告平息。</p>
<h3>開源節流平衡預算　經委會研究辦法　疏通糧源穩定各地米價</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日〕全國經委會，自五月二十六日正式成立後，至本月二日止之一週內，已開會三次，張兼委員長羣，每次均親往主持。茲將三次會議商討範圍及議決事項之要點列叙於下：</p>
<p>（甲）對於經濟繁急措施方案所定平衡預算事項，該會已推定委員分成五小組，詳細研究開源節流之方案。五小組之分類爲：（一）軍費，（二）糧食，（）三財政，（四）國營事業及敵偽產　之出售，（五）一般機關支出之縮减。各小組將於本週內分別與主管機關舉行會議，提出報告，由會中綜合意見，決定具體辦法，迅予實施。</p>
<p>（乙）政府對於糧食之供應已有充份之準備，除積極疏通國內之糧源外，可在救濟物資中獲得大量糧食，並決向外國購進足量之糧食，先在南京·上海。北平·天津·靑島·濟南·福州·汕頭。廣州等處實行配售制度，逐步擴大，配售地域並增加配售日用必需品。糧價平穩，其他物價自能收穩定之效。</p>
<p>（丙）政府一面厲行節約開支，一面擬推行廣泛之節約運動及提倡國貨運動，以造成節約風氣，由會推定專任委員，會同有關機關研究具體辦法。</p>
<h3>港華集體辭職</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港二日電〕「德臣西報」稱：中國警士百餘名，已集體向警務長辭職，原因在於待遇菲薄，每一警士月薪僅一百二十元，其中並須扣除伙食費四十元，故淨得僅八十元而已。</p>

<h3>清查團舊事重提　各地被清查接收舞弊案參會決議促請政府速辦</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京二日電〕淸查問題二日午後於參會中舊事重提，會塲上一片打虎聲。參加淸查團諸參政員，娓娓而道去歲至各地工作情形，聲言大老虎雖未打着，然所打者亦非盡屬蒼蠅。彼等　盡最大務力，決非「掛羊頭賣狗肉」者流。此問題由王立哉臨時動議提出。主氏於提案中指出，淸查團於去歲七八月間先後出發時，至今日不特社會人士不能朋瞭眞相，即參會同仁亦如在五里霧中，殊失當時大會通過組織淸查團意義，且社會人土對參會有許多不正當揣測；爲釋舉疑，並使同仁朋瞭眞相計，擬請參加該團參政員，向大會報告淸查情形及貪污份子名單。該案提出後，伍純武等咸認爲袪羣疑計，淸查結果實有向大會報告必要。吳滄洲報告蘇浙的淸查經過，指出淸查團非查辦團，案件提出後，若無下文，其責任不能完全歸諸淸查團。鄭揆一報告淸查台灣接收工作經過謂，該團在台工作四十日，至少曾打老虎三頭，力有所不逮容或有之，若謂未曾盡力則不敢承認。工作人員絕未受任何外來壓力，決無因受外力而變更初衷之事。梁上棟報告在冀·熱·察·緩工作情形，指出換收人員在平津等地「刧收」物資，予人民惡劣印象。同時又將日人在華北建設工作破壞無遺，殊堪惋惜！該團所辦大案，爲數並不甚多，此因限於時間人力，然並非「掛羊頭賣狗肉」。趙公魯報告在山東青島工作情形稱，該團到達之初，當地人員即謂淸查團決不致有任何結果，然該團在魯曾查出「四大金剛」，在靑亦查出張樂古，上述各案皆牽涉當地權要，案件皆已送交法院，至今未判決，司法機關應負責任。最後由吳望伋報告在上海淸查情形，吳指出上海敵偽物資最多，不幸曾發生怪火案多起，物資腐爛者亦不少，殊爲可惜！本團非無打老虎準備，所惜時間過少。吳氏並舉出所辦大案例子，盼政府對過去案件能儘速澈底整理。報告畢，會中決議促政府對淸查案件從速辦理。</p>
<h3>參會第十八次會議　通過財經糧等決議　迅謀建立國民公平負擔制度</h3>
<p>〔本　　　　二日電〕此次參政會昤取之政府告部門施政報告，均由各審查委員會擬具審查意見，提交大會通過，制成決議文，交政府實施。二日上午第十八次會議中，已將最後六個決議文通過。其要點如下：</p>
<p>整理租稅肅清貪污</p>
<p>對財政報告決議　甲、平衡預算部份：（一）平衡預算根本辦法似應由結束軍事穩定物價與肅淸貪污諸方面着手；（二）整頓租稅，其政策或法令之決定，事前極需審愼，執行後當切實者核；（三）財產稅之舉辦，望本民生主義之立國稍神，迅謀國民公平負擔制度之建立；（四）發行公價宜先恢復信用，穩定幣值；（五）出售敵偽產業及剩餘物資</p>
<p>勿使落入官僚資本家或投機商人之手。</p>
<p>管理外匯應謀改善</p>
<p>乙、穩定金融部份：（一）改進穩定金融辦法；（二）黃金買賣政策，引起恐慌，實屬失策，應請注意；（三）管理外匯始終無一定政策，應亟謀改善；（四）督導銀行資金運用，未能引遊贊步入正軌，工貸缺點更多。</p>
<p>丙、地方財政部份：（一）地方財政收支系統應作合理調整；（二）充實縣市財源寬列預算，以免事後追加或遠法攤派。</p>
<p>對經濟報告决議文</p>
<p>（一）經濟緊急措施亟宜修正；（二）一年來物價愈平愈高，宜更謀治本方法；（三）補貼政策望逐漸轉移爲補貼輸出與增加生產之用；（四）獎勵出口，把握外匯，改善大量入超現象；（五）扶助民營事業，歡迎外籍投資，望能以事實昭示人民；（六）中紡中蠶公司須亟謀全部開工，準備逐漸移讓民營；（七）改進貿易制度，爭取國際市塲，亟望多加努力。</p>
<p>統籌計劃足食足兵</p>
<p>對糧食報告決議文（一）足食足兵爲當今急務，糧政當局應有通盤籌劃，（二）徵實流弊正多，應請分區逐漸取消；（三）購買民糧必須照市價付款；（四）地方士紳憑藉勢力阻撓糧政，應依法嚴辦；。糧政徵收弊端應積極根絕之，各地糧賦分配不均，宜合理調整。</p>

<p>貫澈對日賠償政策</p>

<p>處理敵僞產業決議</p>
<p>（一）接收財產未詳述工廠性質與大小機器數量，應請注意；（二）各地處理機構不同，應請注意；（三）接收物資之管理不善，保存失察或自身消耗，應有詳明之比較統計數字，報告中未能略示眞像，似屬缺憾；（四）敵偽物資之接收與處理，弊端百出，淸查團曾發現種種不法舞弊貪污等情事，政院報告中竟一字未提及辦理此種事件之經過，殊爲遺憾。</p>

<h3>津浦路浦兗段通車後　魯將展開新局面　本報物派記者魯南巡禮之一</h3>
<p>記者這次乘津浦路浦兗段通車典禮之便，在魯南的點和綫上作一次巡禮。足履所至，在這一塊廣大的土地上，深覺有滿目瘡痍之感。</p>
<p>沿綫的車站上，祗剩下了幾垜斷垣殘壁，而唯一的巷代建築物，却是些工事堡壘，和類似「長城」式的防禦物情形顯得是那樣蕭殺，深深的體味到益向北走，益走近了「前綫」</p>
<p>兗州，這一個魯南的重鎭，自古便是兵家必爭之地。目前由於軍事的進展，兗州已成爲國軍前進基地的高級指揮部，和後勸補給的主要根據地。</p>
<p>所以說，這次浦兗段的通車，與其說是利便行旅，不如說是作用全在軍事上。今後國軍在魯南魯中的戰鬥中，將因爲多了這條大動脈，可能在最近展開另外一個新局面。</p>
<p>談到目前國共兩軍的軍事情勢：在國軍收復濟寗，曲阜，寗陽，鄒縣等地區後，兗州和鄰近各縣，已逐漸恢復了正常的聯擊。共軍的主力在這一個地區裏，因爲隨時有被聚殲的危險，大部份已是化整爲零的竄向山岳地帶，僅僅有些零星小股，到處作洗寇式的騷擾，實際上已是不能再起作用，不過今後的魯南，主要的將有賴綏靖工作和各縣政治工作的積極加强，才可使一切踏上正軌，我捫該知道，在還一塊廣大土地上的老百姓，猶在飢餓和貧窮的狀態中。</p>
<p>蔣主席在上月二十日的那一天，曾經從南京坐飛機到兗州去過一次，逗留了三個多小時。對今後魯南的戰局，曾有詳細的指示。相信當津浦路在今年冬季通達濟南的時候，山東的形勢可能將由陰霾的氣氛下轉入一個晴朗的境地中。</p>

<h3>「六三」禁烟紀念　蔣主席特頒訓詞　除毒務盡政府已有決策</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕三日爲「六三」禁烟紀念日，蔣主席特頒訓詞如下：</p>
<p>本年六三禁烟紀念，舉行於憲法業經公佈，憲政即將實施之前，及聯合國禁烟會議完滿閉幕之後，此其意義異常重大。溯自民國廿三年政府決心禁絕烟毒，中正手訂二年禁毒，六年禁烟計劃以來，督飭執行，不遺餘力，中間雖經八年之艱苦抗戰，及敵偽之肆行毒化，而我禁烟政策之執行，則絲毫未嘗放棄，蓋抗戰與禁烟同爲消除統一障得及奠定憲政　礎之重要措施，二者不容偏廢，必使國內烟毒完全肅淸，國外僑民根絕吸食販運烟毒之行爲，然後國家無一不健全之公民，國際無對我指責及誹議之餘地，庶憲政實施始能順利進行。乃戰事結束之後，敵人之毒化尚待淸除，而共軍又復變本加厲，破壤禁政，我全國人民如不痛下決心，悉力圖強，則我已有之禁政成續，將被毀於一旦，其影響於國際地位及　政進行者，必不遜於外患與內亂。甚望我國內外同胞本其數十年來倡導禁烟之光榮歷史，繼續協助政府，宣傳勸導，檢舉告發，而各級禁政主辦協辦機關，輔助團體，以及海外領館，僑領僑團，尤須俠據已頒法令，嚴切執行，上下一心，全力以赴，以昔日殲敵致果及報效祖國之精神，與殘餘烟毒作最後之搏鬥。其染有烟毒嗜好及種售烟毒之國內外人民，更望時時以個人生命及國家之地位爲念，迅即滌除舊染，奮勉自新，共同完成禁政。總之，除毒務盡，政府已有決策，憲政開始之後，如尚有一人或一地之違禁，斯即吾人今日之職責未盡，亦即我全民族之恥辱未雪。希乘六三禁烟紀念，輾轉告誡，相互督勉，務期紀念大會閉幕之後，即展開更積極更澈底之禁烟工作，將來憲政實施之日，亦即禁政成功之時，除萬佈新，強民建國，有厚望焉。</p>

<h3>印度人民的抉擇　分治乎？統一乎？</h3>
<p>英國駐印總督蒙巴頓已於昨日召集印度各政黨領袖，舉行圓桌會議，當塲宣佈甫自倫敦携來英國政府對於印度問題所提定之解決方案，聽任印度人民在統一與分治二者之間，抉擇其一，所以動盪不定的印度政局，紛擾了一百五十年，現在已到了最後決定的關頭。統一乎？分治乎？在這一二日內就可以分曉。英國當局爲了預防萬一起見，軍警戒備得十分森嚴。就是全世界的人士，對於印度未來的命運，也無不表示莫大的關切。據一般觀察的預測，印度的分治，勢在必行；但在此次圓桌會議決定印回分治之後，印度發生內戰，勢將無法避免。印度果眞被迫走上這條悲慘的厄運，實在是戰後國際政治上的一幕大悲劇。</p>
<p>印度在英國統治之下，無時不企求獨立與自主；今年二月廿二日，英國首相艾德禮在下議院宣佈，英國自一九四八年六月一日起退出印度，而將政權完全移交印度政府；這個重大的聲明，不僅使印度人民熱烈歡迎，就是其他國家的人民對於英國工黨政府所採取的賢明措施，也無不表示贊美。論理印度人民所共有的民族願望，不久就可以完全實現，只要大家肯和衷共濟，不受宗派分歧的影響，而能一心一意，爲民主統一自主的印度而共同努力，則至明年六月一日，一個光明的新興的印度就可以出現在我們的眼前了。但是環顧印度國內的局勢，宗派分歧，情况複雜，使印度統一的前途，潛伏着重重暗礁。其中最重要的暗礁，莫過於印回衝突。回教聯盟堅持着「巴基斯坦」與「印度斯坦」的分離，且已至無可妥協的境地，再加以印度境內藩邦羅布，至今尚保持着自中世紀以來的君主傳統，怎錄能排除萬難而遠到全國的統一，實在不是一件容易的工作。所以印度光明的遠景，仍爲陰霾所籠罩，展望前途，實在不容樂觀。世人對於印度能獲得獨立而不能統一，終不免於分裂，自不能不表示惋惜；尤其是我們同處東亞而爲印度貼鄰的中國人。</p>
<p>自從英國政府宣佈還政於印人之後，印度國內印回的衝突，不僅沒有减輕或緩和，反而火上加油，愈演愈烈，使印度各地均陷於擾攘不安的狀態下：蒙巴頓總督自履新以來，雖然也竭盡智慮，想調和印度各大政黨間的意見，希望他們能和衷共濟，同爲新印度而犧牲成見，但是三個月來努力的結果，並沒有收到一點成效，因此也就不得不遷就回敎聯盟的意見，而主張聽任印度人民在統一與分治的兩種辦法中抉擇其一了。五月十七日蒙巴頓總督奉召返國，卽將印度各大政黨的意見，詳細報告政府，並提出自己的主張，英國內閣在無可如何之中，也只好勉强表示同意。其要點有五：（一）解散新德里現有之制憲會議；（二）印度敎徒與回敎徒分別各自成立制憲會議，起草印回分治之憲法；（三）孟加拉與旁遮普兩大省內部，亦實行分治；（四）西北邊省舉行公民投票，以決定自治抑或併入印度斯坦或巴基斯坦；（五）現行各黨聯合臨時政府之權力，將移交綜合臨時新政府，由每一制憲會議派代表組織之。（六）英國應將政權移交給印度敎徒制憲會議及回敎徒制憲會議。</p>
<p>當英國內閣討論這個方案時，也曾一度引起意見的分歧，同時回敎聯盟主席眞納，文提出新要求，並將巴基斯坦的含義，分析爲六點：（一）回敎聯盟要求印度斯坦給予走廊，以聯絡西北巴甚斯坦與東北巴基斯坦；（二）回敎聯盟對於孟加拉與旁遮普兩省分治之要求，不肯放棄尺土寸地；（三）巴基斯坦與英國之間，可以建立一種眞正有利之關係；（四）巴基斯坦與印度斯坦應樹立友好互惠關係；（五）巴基斯坦政府應爲人民的代表政府；（六）巴基斯坦將聲請加入聯合國機構。眞納的要求，不僅爲印度國民大會黨所反對，而且也非英國內閣所能同意；所以英國內閣一再討諭，在無可如何的狀態中，始把蒙巴頓總督的方案，予以批准，並由其帶回印度，聽任印人自由抉擇。</p>
<p>英國對於印度問題的解決方案，雖已商有成議，對於回敎聯盟的分治要求，在原則上表示同意：但是堅決主張印度統一的國民大會黨的態度如何，是最值得我們注意的。印度臨時政府內閣副總統尼赫魯於廿四日駁斥眞納要求時曾稱：「吾人唯有盼望印度之團結一致，吾人無强制他人之意，但亦不能忍受他人之强制；倘別無其他要求，而能依此獲致正當解決辦法，則吾人當可進而促成印度之統一，」國民大會黨且已正式通知英國政府，無諭在何種情形之下，均不贊成將印度劃分爲巴基斯坦與印度斯坦。聖雄甘地的態度，尤爲激烈：甘地曾發表非常沉痛的話：「英國必須先殺我甘地，然後始可劃分印度」，又謂「若回敎聯盟表示：不與我巴基斯坦，吾人卽將用劍；」吾人當答以「吾人決不與汝以巴基斯坦，汝儘可將我或國家切成碎片。」準此而論，昨日在新德里開幕的圓桌會議，勢必發生爭執，未必卽能商得協議。</p>
<p>要之，印度政局已瀕於發生內戰的邊緣，印回雙方領袖，若不能運用政治智慧，泯除宗派的歧視，在統一與分治之間，覓得一條中間的道路，則深恐印度或將走上自取滅亡的途徑了。但願站在調人地位的英國總督，始終不偏不倚，折衷至當，從中拉攏，促成印回雙方的和衷共濟，俾能化反氣爲祥和，使印度眞正能够新生。</p>

<h3>召集印度七領袖會議　印督提出分治計劃　會後接見甘地舉行長談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：蒙巴頓今日與印度七領袖舉行圓桌會議凡兩小時，結果英閣所擬統一印度行政之原來計劃，竟遭拒絕予以討論。蒙督當時立即提出另一相反之建議，其中包括印度分治，及委派國際委員會決定新界綫等，並限令印度領袖在二十四小時內答復。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：新德里今日發表公報：據稱英方還政與印人之計劃，將於明日發表，顯示印主要政黨已接受英方建議。公報復稱，蒙巴頓將於明夜廣播並宣佈英方計劃內容。</p>
<p>〔合衆社新德里二日電〕官方公報稱：英印圓桌會議於二日晨召開會議歷二小時，蒙巴頓在席間就如何使英政府採取目前計劃之歷次在印度與英國之會議，作一詳細報吿，並將宣言之副本分送各領袖。會議遂即延至明晨十時續開，使各委會有時間加以硏究，會後眞納與蒙巴頓作簡短之談話，午後十二時三十分，總督與又甘地晤談直至一時一刻。總督定明日下午四時接見上院議長與各省代表十四人。三日下午七時，總督將作廣播演說，全印電台並將放送英政府之宣言，此後尼赫魯眞納與辛格等亦將相繼演說。四日晨十時總督將舉行記者招待會。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德進里二日電〕印督與印度七領袖之會議，今晨舉行兩小時即延會。今晨鐘鳴十時，與會之印領袖即抵達會塲，以聆取印督自倫敦　返之計劃。首先抵達者爲回盟主席眞納，渠口含雪茄，面露笑容。繼之抵達者爲印度臨時政府副總統尼赫魯，表情嚴肅，同來者爲內長巴台爾及國大黨主席克里巴拉尼，錫克族領袖辛格。縱之到達最後到塲者爲回盟之其他兩領袖臨時政府交通部長尼希達財長艾里漢。各代表抵總督公署時，署俞並未集有大批民衆，亦無示威之事。會後印度領袖辭出總督公署時，均面露笑容，眞納較其他印度領袖遲二十分鐘辭出，當記者詢以「得了嗎？」（意即巴基斯坦之要求如願以償否）眞納未曾作答。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里二日電〕印督蒙巴頓將於今晨十時，向印度領袖建裁以自治領地位給予印度斯坦及巴基斯坦，孟加拉及本哲布兩省實行區械分治，並在西北邊省舉行新選舉，以決定該省之應否屬於巴基斯坦。據極可靠方面稱，英政府將請印度領袖接受威斯特敏特法案下之自治領地位，英國將不干涉或控制印度斯坦及巴基斯坦，惟後者須宣誓效忠英王。此一計劃，可使印度陸軍繼續受一個參課部管轄而毋須分裂，陸軍於一九四八年六月即行分裂爲二之現象，已可避免。據云，若千國大黨領袖業已接受此一建議，若國大黨及回盟均接受自治領地位，具有英王代表身份之總督將自動撤銷，代之者爲派駐自治領之總督。而目前之印度臨時政府自亦將隨之消滅，代之者爲自治領政府。總督於今晨獲知印度領袖對該項計劃之反響後，至遲今晚即可電知倫敦，星期二下午印督將晤見各土邦代表。</p>
<h3>印全境嚴密戒備　會前夕蒙督視察動亂區</h3>

<h3>英報評論印度問題</h3>
<p>認分治前途未許樂觀</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦二日電〕「新聞紀事報」今日著論稱：印度實行分治，或爲解決印度問題之唯一辦法，但亦非善策，吾人對此引爲遺憾。以言印度領袖在新德里舉行之圓桌會議一事，世人注意自將集中於此。總督蒙巴頓與之會議，正欲以全力促成印度領袖間之協調，此爲決定印度命運之關鍵，且亦爲世界之重要關頭。此一會議之任務，乃在處理世界五分之一人口即四萬萬人之將來問題，時至此際，印度領袖不能再存英國將以刺刀迫使其勁敵屈服之心。就目前情形而論，分治似已不可避免，但愛護印度之人恐僅少數對其前途引爲樂觀。例如將孟加拉與本哲布兩省劃分，適足使印度不穩之經濟更趨緊張。印度數百萬生靈今正履於險境，倘新德里會議不得不採取劃分決議，則吾人深望能以和平手段爲之，並應顧及經濟之事實</p>

<h3>蘇政府努力培養青年軍事幹部</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕杜魯門總統之軍事訓練顧問委員會今日發表蘇聯兵力硏究報吿書，作爲美國實行普遍軍訓之參考。據稱，蘇聯兵力乃紅軍之義務兵役及學校中之軍事訓練爲基礎。蘇聯十九歲至五十歲之健全壯丁均有服兵役之義務。蘇聯並鼓勵半軍事性質之組織如射擊俱樂部，運動團體，及靑年團體之類。今年並創設一特別組織，名爲「防止空襲及化學戰爭協會」，已有男女會員一千六百萬人。官方雖稱該會係人民自動組織，事實上係一政府機構，專爲人民實行各種軍事訓練。蘇聯爲長成軍官人材起見，蘇伏羅夫各軍官學校正從事訓練年甫十歲之兒童，使成爲職業軍官。學生名額共爲四千五百人。學程七年，畢業後可升入軍事大學，大學畢業即成軍官蘇聯普遍青年軍役自十九歲足歲開始，中學畢業生則自十八歲足歲開始。其適宜於作戰者，派入現役軍隊，服役二年至五年，或即調入「第一綫預備軍」。其須奉養年老體弱之雙親者，及超過每年徵兵名額者，於現役完畢，直接調入「第二綫預備軍」。全部後備兵隨時可調入現役軍，並須按期在訓練營受訓一個月至三個月。婦女亦得徵召入伍，由軍政部長指派具有醫學，獸醫學及其他特種訓練之婦女，加入陸海軍。此等婦女平時得召入訓練營，戰時可被徵參加輔助隊及特別隊服役。</p>
<h3>塔虎脫主張　批准四國和約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕共和黨政策委員會主席塔虎脫參議員今日宣稱：渠擁護參議院外交委員會主席范登堡主張，核准義大利，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞及匈牙利四國和約。一部份反對派意見業經詳細攷慮，若輩以爲批准義大利和約後，美國軍隊將撤退，或將造成義大利共產黨攫取政權之機會。塔氏並稱，美軍撤退後局勢如何，余不得而知，亦不想任何人能在此刻加以揣測。義大利共黨或不免攫取政權，果爾，則吾人援助希臘土耳其方案以防止共產主義之舉又將如何。問題確實重大。但余以爲權衡輕重，實以批准和約爲宜。該約可能爲蘇聯惟一同意者。</p>
<h3>德著名飛機設計家梅塞施密特擬赴美　傳將研究原子能飛機</h3>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖一日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦調查委員會法定人數已於一日到齊，二日下午將舉行組織會議。由於五國代表缺席之故，該委員會曾延期一週之久，二口將討論六項組織及執行問題，此項問題在該委員會赴巴勒斯坦實地調査之前，必須先予解決。瑞典代表賽特斯屈魯最有當選主席之希望，蓋其法律經騐豐富，且瑞典素以中立國著稱。其次荷蘭代表亦有當選主席之可能。該委員會於決定各項人選以後，當首先討論路綫問題，然後再討論應否允許猶太，阿拉伯及英國派遣觀察員參與會議。至於該委員會將否訪問歐洲之流亡人員　中營，則須抵達巴勒斯坦後再　決定。</p>
<h3>菲副總統赴歐</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約一日電〕菲律濱副總統季里諾，本日乘坐飛機自此前往歐洲，將赴歐洲各國京城，籌設菲律濱大使館。</p>
<h3>美即將邀集有關國家　商對日和約問題　俾能早日召開對日和會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕據消息靈通之官員今日稱：對日本和約，國務院現在　速計擬中。由於此項進展之結果，預料美在不久將來將與其他對賠款有關國家，提議召開和會。國務卿馬歇爾尙未透露，美國究將提出苦干國家，應參加實際起草和約事宜。惟官方稱：美國立塲，當其作明確之聲明時，料不至將此項工作專由四強担任，如歐洲和約之情形然。馬歇爾以及其他官吏，承認澳洲，菲列濱及其他國家，由於彼等對日作戰之貢獻，應有權參加起草條約，現已有徵象，足以表示美國將提出遠東委員會十一個國家之大部分或全部，應參加起草和約。至召開會議日期一點言之，該官員稱：目前之目的，乃在儘速做到，因馬歇爾已予此事儘早處置之決心也。貝爾納斯爲國務卿時之假定，即將對日和約應等待德奧和約締結之後，現已完全放棄。雖一再謠傳美國現正與英或其他國家磋商起草對日條約計劃，然迄今尙未有何正式之舉。惟此舉預料在下月內即將實行。澳洲官方要求早日召開和會，並予澳洲有充分參與之權，早爲此間所承認。馬歇爾拒絕評論胡佛之建躋，即美國如不能獲得蘇聯同意時，美與日本簽訂單獨條約。消息靈通官員稱：美國所以採取此種能度，可能爲美國關於對日條約，不預期有若干眾大異見，存在於美國與蘇聯之間，如歐洲各和約然。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京一日電〕蘆田均今暗示甫成立一日之片山內閣，即懷有與盟國早日締結和約之野心。蘆田宣稱：渠正計劃擴大現外務省及中央聯絡局，以準備與同盟國家，早早召開和會。然政治觀察家認爲外省之聲明，係暗示片山內閣希望在和會席上，與各同盟國相晤。</p>
<h3>蘇聯向奧提供保證努力解決奧俘問題　蘇報責法違反遣送僑民恊定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社維也納一日電〕奧地利婦女代表團今日由內閣總理吉夫爾率領，向蘇聯佔領軍總司令部請願，在今冬以前遺送蘇聯境內奧俘虜返國。據奧官方稱：目前仍有奧俘虜十萬名以上拘留在蘇聯，彼蘭與南斯拉夫。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社維也納一日電〕蘇聯駐奧地利副高級專員薛爾托夫，本日向奧國戰俘妻子代表團提供保證，蘇聯當局將繼續努力，解決蘇聯所拘押之　國戰俘問題。薛爾托夫將軍對於若干奧國人士利用戰俘問題，發動政治運動一層，表示扼腕。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科一日電〕蘇聯評論家寇里洛夫本日在「眞理報」發表一文，指斥法國佔領當局，尤其是奧境法國佔領當局，違反法蘇兩國於一九四五年六月廿九日所簽訂之遣送僑民協定。其文略謂，蘇聯已將蘇境內或蘇軍佔領區內之法國國民遣返本國，法國參戰軍人及陣亡將士部長亦曾吿國民大會謂，蘇聯控制之地區中，已不復再有法國戰俘，此在另一方面，法國佔領區內之若干報紙竟促請蘇聯僑民不返本國而遷往法國，加拿大，美國或其他國家，法國此種態度實違反法蘇兩國之遣送僑民協定云。</p>

<h3>青年軍復員紀念二萬青年大檢閱　黨政軍等各機關首長致詞勗勉大會通過組織統一建國大同盟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日爲靑年軍復員紀念節，上海市各界復員靑年，昨日上午在虹口中正公園聯合舉行慶祝靑年軍復員週年紀念大會，參加者除本市各學校及職業界復員靑年外，尚有靑年軍二〇二師，蘇魯皖區鄕鎭幹部訓練班，杭州嘉興兩地靑年中學職榮中學學生，及上海市童子軍等共二萬餘人。吳市長宣司令潘議長方主委吳幹事長等均到會致詞。</p>
<p>大檢閱時一鏡頭，前車上立者，左宣司令，右吳市長。　（本報攝）</p>
<h3>各首長致詞</h3>
<p>吳市長致辭略調：我們首須感謝愛國愛民在日寇猖獗祖國危殆之時投筆從我靑年們的犧牲精神。現在國家紊亂，需要統一，民生痛苦，需要安定，所有熱血靑年應以國族至上之精神，來統一國家，安定社會，從事建國工作。</p>
<p>宣司令稱：我們復員已一週年，但復員工作尚未完成，共黨稱兵叛亂，破壞統一，民盟亦到處煽惑人心，造成社會不安。但我們亦須虛心檢討自已缺點，力求矯正，只有本身健全的人，才配談革命，願我靑年努力振作，從事建國革命工作。</p>
<p>潘議長致詞稱：要强調統一建設。上海爲國際都市，故一舉一動足以影響全國。我們願協助政府組織類似美國之「非美國調查委員會」之團體，從事調查幷肅淸不忠於祖國之搗亂份子。</p>
<p>方主委略謂：共黨民盟擬在今大煽動「三罷一慘」運動，幸賴吾靑年之團結力，及市長宣司令等賢明之措置鎭壓，使其無法蠶動。我們需要眞民主眞自由，反對「匪民主」「匪自由」，要反飢餓，必須增加生產，要反內亂，必須戡亂，才能爭取和平統一，安定民生。</p>
<p>吳幹事長謂：在曾最富正義感之靑年們，回憶領袖號召十萬靑年十萬軍，彼時共黨反對分化最力。然此種陰謀終爲正義擊敗，而勝利後的今天，中國需要安定團結求學，故我們反對叛亂，反對分裂，反對罷課。在塲靑年應爲安定團結反罷課之主力。</p>
<p>嗣由靑年軍二〇二師第二旅旅長顧蓉君少將陪同各界首長及來賓，乘軍用吉普車檢閱隊伍行列。受檢閱靑年皆精神飽滿，朝氣蓬勃，情况空前熱烈。會後乘卡車經北四川路南京路至哈同路散會。途中並由靑年團員化裝表演共黨之罪行。大會幷通過上蔣主席電，致國民參政會電，致上海市參議會電，及組織上海市靑年統一建國大同盟等提案。</p>
<h3>上蔣主席電</h3>
<p>茲錄大會上蔣主席電如下：「團民政府主席　鈞　，　　以還，兩閱寒暑，本應全臘上下，一心　發，躋國族於富張，乃共匪猖授，割據叛亂，出賣祖國，層　同胞，陷人民於水深火熱之中，致國際地位日趨低落。近　於日暮窮途之餘，到處煽動學潮，工潮，造成社會不安，言念及此，曷極痛憤。爰聯合全滬變國靑年五萬人，同申義討，誓榮忠勇愛國之精神，在鈞座英明領導之下，擁護政府統一建國國策，全力安定社會秩序，尚祈明令　　，　　　　，　人民　　　，　　　於民主　　之坦途，國家幸甚，全民幸甚。上海市各界靑年聯合慶祝靑年　復員週年紀念大會　叩已冬印」。</p>

<h3>警官追擊可疑男子中彈倒地畏罪自殺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕虹口警分局武進路派出所巡官楊漢星，昨晨零點十五分左右，隻身乘自由軍外出查勤，至武進路四十一號，迎面靠牆邊突來一人，衣玄色舊西裝，由西朝東，形色慌張，當喝令止步，並命其高舉雙手，以待搜查。孰知該人竟拔步而逃，同時出槍開及二響。幸楊巡官機警，斜身躲去，急亦回擊二槍，但亦未中。該人向吳淞路力面亂竄，至哈爾演路東行，適有保安警士一一六三三號，一一九四四號，一二六四六號巡邏到來睹狀，知非善類，一二六四六號　土開放步槍亦未中，時該人已逃至四十五號門首，經楊巡官瞄準其下部，連發二彈，始有一彈射中其臀部，不支而踣。斯時該人竟畏罪自擊額部一榆仆地身死，死後右手仍緊握左輪手槍一支，腰部繫有子彈帶一根，左手持黑色皮槍壳一枚，死老年可三旬，身畔無身份證，故不知姓氏，屍體已送騐屍所候騐。</p>
<h3>參議大會討論提案　小學延遲放學問題引起一塲熱烈辯論　通過請市府轉飭敎育局斟酌辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日下午舉行大會第四次會議。討諭有關敎育，工務，公用，地政，警察等提案，今日下午第五次會議將繼續討論提案，原定之休會式則將延期一日或二日舉行。</p>
<p>大會昨熱烈討諭關於敎育提案中之「小學放學延遲一小時」案，據原提案之理由爲：「查小學生每日放學時間，大多爲午後三時至四時，此時多數家長，工作尚未返家，無人監護，殊多危險。况在此夏令時間，正在大好陽光之候，各小學校正可將渠留校自修，或其他工作，以免荒廢時刻。」</p>
<p>悶在亭子間裏比留學校更壞</p>
<p>各參議員紛紛提出意見，按原審查意見爲「請市府轉飭敎育局斟酌辦理」，但吳參議員正矱測對此案表示反對，渠意現在一般小學校，設備多數不合理想，小學生在此種學校環境內多留時間，對於身體頗有影響。陸蔭初則認爲一般小學生住家、均甚狹小，回家後悶在亭子間裏，其情形將比在學校內更壞。仝道雲建議不妨將下午上課時間遲一小時，放學亦邋一小時（現在一至三時上課，改爲二至四時）。當有其他數參議員贊成此議，然亦有若干議員表示應請敎局酌辦，而仝參議員則再請作硬　　定。</p>
<p>吃飯走路　快有碍小孩　生</p>
<p>龐京周，張中原亦稱：小孩爲趕上課，每每吃飯太快，或走路太快，對於衛生有碍，應予延遲爲是。但傅曉峯則稱：這辦法不太好，因爲硬性規定後，到了冬天，四五點鐘天已快黑，課室內光綫太暗，小孩放學，在馬路上走也不便，故到了冬天，應交敎局斟酌辦理。王先　表示同意傳參議員意思，並謂小學生早些回家，可多一些時間休息，同時有許多敎職員授課後尚有其他工作，或私人事務，放學延遲後頗受影響。最後經大會付表決，多　通過照原審查意見，「請市府　飭敎育局斟酌辦理」。</p>
<p>出租中正營址羣起質問祝平</p>
<p>又關於「擬將澕漕鎭中正營舊址，闢爲本市中等敎育區」一案，緣該中正營舊址有地二百餘畝，被地政局出租並訂有十年租約，致遭參議員對祝局長，羣起質問。後經潘議長起稱：市參議會組織條例第二條「市參議會之職櫂」中第五款謂「議決市有財產之經營及處分事項」，但據地政局報告中並未提及此事，故請求市府將此土地租用之合同，面積，租金，以及出租經過，於明日（即今日）大會中報告，並請大會討論或予追認，俟土地問題解決後，再討論闢爲本市中等教育區案，全塲當即鼓堂贊同此議。</p>
<p>嚴禁古物出口送請市府參攷</p>
<p>此外經大會通過之敎育提案有：（一）「新頒法規，應予宣講，俾家喻戶曉，而利推行」案，決議請市府轉警察，民政有關各局處，共同負責辦理。（二）「請市敎育局轉令各校於工人團體創設勞工補習學校時，應優先借用課室」案，決該請敎育局辦理。（三）「凡人民團體或工廠舉辦之各級學校，請教育局免予儲存敎育基金」案，決議由本會電請敎育部及函請敎育局通融免繳。（四）「擬請市敎育局辦理科學模型，舉行活動敎育」案，決議送請敎育局參攷。（五）「請敎育局切實辦理興建市立江灣中學校舍」，通過。（六）「請敎育局辦理增撥上海市立博物館經費，以資充實內容，加强本市文化敎育」案，通過。（七）「由市府設法切實嚴禁古物出口，幷轉飭市立博物館選購重要古物保藏陳列」案，決議送請市府參攷。（八）「請從速收回虹橋飛機塲，積極建立中芷文化敎育區，以重本市文化之發展，而示對國家領袖之崇敬」案，通過。</p>
<h3>參議會預算委會再度審查衛生費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會預算委員會徐永祚等五參議員，於昨晨九時，舉行會議，再度審查衛生經費等預算數項，經審查結果，關於：（一）第一次追加預算中之淸除宿積垃圾臨時費四五三，二〇〇，〇〇〇元及航空測量費五三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，或則係事實上確有必要，或則係奉命辦理，且已開始舉辦，姑准列入。（二）第三次迫加預算中之修理　車一八七，八二五，〇〇〇元及修建小便池一四八，六九二，五〇〇元，前者可由該局原預算中之臨時修給費內開支，後者准予照列。（三）　　　　書，將於今日下午大會前　就。</p>
<p>又市府施政報告審查會，亦於昨日上午舉行會議，審查完畢，將於今日大會中提出討論。</p>
<h3>交大敎授會要求參議會表示贊同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會　議長在昨日參議大會中報告有關學潮事二件：（一）關於交大敎授會提出「因五月三十日衝突而受傷之學生，其醫藥費及學校所受指失由市參議會調查後請市府支給」一點，應由參議會回覆表示同意。（二）推請趙仰雄，奚玉書，嚴以霖三參議員出席今晨復旦大學敎授理監事會。當經大會一致贊同上項二點。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕市參議會爲明瞭本市直接稅局業務情形，已函請該局局長樓國威於今日下午出席大會報告。</p>
<h3>請願者四起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各業同業公會，昨日下午派代表赴市參議會，請願所利得稅事宜。民營廣播電台亦派代表赴會請願，取消與國營電台不平等之待遇。敎育團體私校同人，再赴參會，請願實物配給。</p>
<p>此外尚有本市中央·滬西·浦東等區鮮肉商，昨赴市參議會請願，略稱：年來本市中央，虹口·滬西·浦東·南市等區內軍憲包括廿部隊，屢向各該區境內肉商强迫售與虧本鮮肉，彼輩付與代價僅每斤一千五百元以還二千元不等，顯屬不堪剝蝕。上月三十日經本會代表失志高求見憲兵卅三團團本部劉副官，進行折衛，結果雖蒙准自五月卅一日起，飭照每斤三千元代價給付，惟核計每斤仍須虧蝕血本四五千元之鉅。各同業實難負擔，紛紛到會聲請上級機關請願，一面由本會負責人顧子雲分呈警備司令部，及上海市政府瀝陳苦情。渠等之期望爲要求答覆，並准予制止憲兵恃强購買虧本鮮肉，以安民生而蘇商困。</p>
<p>又訊：據憲兵廿三團負責人告記者稱：關於本團購買之鮮肉價格（每斤二千元），事前曾徵得南市區肉商代表同意，最近肉價高漲，該業代表並未通知，且該團憲兵亦從無强迫購買情事。開波浦東，使兩岸土地平均發畏</p>
<p>請求中央在美國進出口銀行五億元借款項下，劃撥美金二千萬元，建造越江工程，以將來越江通　費與工程受益費收入，勻期　還借款本息」案，決議照案通違，除送請市府轉飭工務局計劉辦理外，所需經費，擬請大會電請行政院准予照撥。</p>
<h3>修老閘橋開放車輛</h3>
<p>（四）「請工務局負責組織防潦工程委員會，以利防潦工程」案，議決通過，但辦法中關於經費一項，保留於討諭預算時合併討諭。（五）「請市政當局迅速修理老閘橋，開放軍輛行駛，以利交通」案，決議：照案通過，送請市府辦理經費在市預算超收部份撥付，修竣後只准行駛人力軍，三輸車，自行車，其他車輛不得通行。（六）「爲楊樹浦平凉路東段路面，破壞不堪，擬請迅予修理案，」決議：照案通過，送請市府辦理，經費部份由市府與中紡公司及各廠商共同籌指。（七）「請市府轉飭警察，衛生，公用，工務四局，迅速整理南市日暉港，斜徐　段沿河　　　　　　　　衛生」，　，　決通過。（八）「疏浚虹口沙涇港工作案，通過擬請市政府統偉辦理，（九）「請市府統籌辦理邁路條　，以利交通」案，議決通過。（十）「請市府提前　復　　路橋，以利交通」案，議決通過。</p>
<h3>衛生局　職員被訴　貪污瀆職　地院開庭審究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕衛生局職員朱　，陳博宇，被劉古林及劉妻黃氏控告貪污凟職一案，昨在地院開庭審訊。緣劉古林係承製該局垃圾　車，因貨價上漲，交貨稍遲，致有餘款二千二百十萬元，屢請該局給付未得。朱等利用職務上之便利，偽稱劉應繳罰款已超過請領款數，須疏通帮忙云云。上月十二日朱陳會同劉至九江路上海市銀行領款之際，即共同强取劉領得之現鈔一包一百廿九萬元，劉不肯給。雙方爭執之際，劉黃氏呼警，經市銀行警衛張標等作證，扭送黃浦分局，轉送地檢處以食污罪起訴。朱在押，陳在逃，該案昨在地院由饒推事審訊一過，論知改期再訊。</p>
<h3>指數解凍後　各方反應不一　資方如確不勝負擔儘可開誠洽商解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕五月份職工生活指數公佈後，各方反應不一。一般廠商多認爲不能負擔，機器業工業同業公會理事長顏耀秋等且於上週六赴社會局請示如何依合法手續關門。此在職工方面，則對此次指數多表滿意，惟望物價勿再上漲，否則生活仍難維持。</p>
<p>社會局副局長李劍華昨語記者稱：，此次公佈之指數，一般多認爲過於龐大。其實指數係根據物價而來，並菲虛製。現今所成爲問題者，爲炎方之能否負擔。惟據上海市工資調整辦法第五條載明：「資方如因生產及營業情况不佳，確難貨擔，不能照本辦法三至五條規定發給工資時，得由勞資雙方協議减少之。如協議不能成立時，由勞資評斷會評斷之。」故資方如確實不能負擔，可召集工廠會議與職工代表，開誠商談解決，否則貿然關廠，而致大批工人失業，並非辦法。此外另有一途，即請政府協助解決困難。諸如代爲購置原料，免除不必要之捐稅，便利運輸，開拓銷路，以及舉辦正當之工業貸款等，以减輕資方一部份負擔</p>
<p>水祥雲對本月份公佈之生活指數，發表感想如次：（一）政府今日所決定者，爲九折累進計算，在工方言，已作相當讓步。目前上海之物價指數，據非正式之統計，已在四萬倍左右，工人所得即使依指數計算，亦僅爲最低生活費而已，如廠方對此亦加反對，難免敎起工潮。（二）有少數工廠因經濟情形不佳，不能全按指數給酬者，宜本勞資協調同舟共濟之義，由雙方開誠洽商，以求解決。本人相信工人方面，亦決無故意逼倒工廠之意，如資方確有困難時，工人願作讓步。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕工業協會常務理事胡伯翔。田和卿，於上星期六連袂晋京，聞與生活指數解凍後，廠方之困難情形有關。</p>

<h3>華聯征輪勝負觀測　戰略運用為今晚重要關鍵</h3>
<p>今夕征輪戰華聯，有人預料華聯可勝，也有人認爲華聯必致慘敗。這兩個不同的看法，各有所據，並不矛盾。</p>
<p>客歲華聯初被羣聲敗辱，加以隊員在比賽之日，多患腹瀉，扶恙登塲，士氣頹唐，實爲受挫於征綸的主因。今番征綸捲土重來，六戰全勝，藝事進境迅速，而華聯軍心奮發，近况至佳，復仇雪恥，非不可能。</p>
<p>論全隊默契工夫，與個·敎術，征輸造詣不及華聯之深·但征綸的長力及速度，與射籃不拘遠近再度的準確性，也殊可畏。是賽不啻兩隊智與力的競爭。因此，戰略運用得宜，將成爲決勝的重要關鍵。</p>
<p>不過，我個人以爲華聯具有較多的嬴面條件：籃下球的優勢，必爲華聯取得，毫無疑問。老包，阿弟目前都在峯巓狀態之中，大李，學崇昔日威風依然，個人的控球工夫，華聯平均在征輪之上。</p>
<p>在戰略上，華聯應努力奪取主動地位，市長杯敗於哥侖布之役，便是一個好敎訓，華聯不妨保持一貫作風，以穩妥爲主，放棄和征綸在速度上角逐，多用短傳，擲籃時，須利用跟進，務要儘可能地减少球落入敵手的機會。因爲體力不逮，華聯不宜採人釘人戰法，但對屠文龍，于瑞章應特別留意，必要時，可以大李及老包分別監守之，不容有出手擲籃的機會，而華聯仍有學崇與阿弟可以獲分，孔廣益不妨出塲，對付這些經驗未充的猛將，老孔是較相成更爲合宜，希望老孔的遠射，能够和劉政軍的得分抵銷，但是，倘非情勢必需，仍不宜多試遠射的。</p>
<p>此外，華聯更應設法引誘造成征輪的侵人犯規，如屠，于，蔡三人之中，一人罰出，局勢即可決定，倘屠文龍在最後十分鐘之前「畢業」，征綸必無法與華聯抗爭。</p>
<p>除非屠，蔡，于的手風順遂，劉政軍的遠射十投九中，或者華聯中途氣力不逮—尤其是大李，我相信，今晚之戰，征輪頗難僥倖。（昌年）</p>

<h3>華股市況全面慘寫塲外交易又見法動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股昨代用品改用美金債券，業已由所方正式公布，決無轉圖餘地，終告全面崩潰。多方若一五二號二一一號等忍痛斬售，永紗跌停後，暗市喊低至六一〇〇元以下。全塲跌　限度者違十之九，一般人對遞交祗准轉期一月及美債代用品措置，所方分兩次公布，均抱遣憾。大部份交易，均轉往塲外。塲外永紗成交價昨高於塲內百餘元。聞業中人嘗，有背景之空頭，昨在塲外補進七八十萬，而一般多方，亦頗多在場內了結，　住塲外者，是以塲外交易轉趨興旺。</p>
<p>晨開即感惶惶，即交各股雖較穩定，但遞交開出即告慘跌，遞永紗開後，二三一號一二一七號有補，雖略園上，七六號一六三號一一九號二七號一〇二號二〇七號三六號來賣，退爲六八二〇元。二三五號一五五號一四號稍納而略盤，一一七號九四號一二一〇五號一五七號趁低維持，雖升而不多。火柴首先跌停，一八五號一五三號二二四號一〇四號一五二號來賣，遞永紗遂告跌停。中絲麗安永公華豐次第跌停，暗市喊低至六四八〇元以下。九九號一六〇號一四一號來進，六一號九九號則進現永紗，曾升至六六五〇元左右，無何一〇二號七六號一五二號力售之下，終於再告跌至限度。現永紗中法統益信和景福勤興新華新光景綸中紡次第跌停，二一一號一五二號一〇二號連袂力售，每况愈下，交易毫無，有供無求，臨收遞永紗步降至六一五〇元。收後一二九號三二號再賣，遂降至六一〇〇元以下。結果較上週六計即交各股除國貨尚平，新亞微挫，水泥商務各跌一成强，新華永公榮豐麗安跌停後有回，各降一成至二成不等外，餘均跌停。遞交各股亦一致跌至限度，塲外各老股自微跌迄降半成强不等。</p>
<p>公債昨以環境，及銀根兩皆不利，而告怯疲。統丙自長開開一四八〇〇元起，步降至一一三四〇〇元，潤德及散戶有售。最後空方有補，而站一四〇〇〇元徘徊。結果較上週六計甲乙丙丁各跌一千元，戊種亦挫九百元，成交約六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨以人心不佳，持有者急於了結。加之港申電亦升至十四元外，怡紗並有市上發現遺失股票者，市况頗爲席疲。成交十分冷落，怡紗晨開即退至六九〇〇〇元，高價七〇〇〇〇元，最後六八五〇〇元。結果較上週六計英聯怡紗鋼業怡啤紙業跌一成，餘降半成。</p>
<h3>經紀人三項希望證交決呈部核示　開市時間將予修改</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交經紀人公會，於昨日上午十時，召開臨時常務理事會議，對財經兩部關於保證金繳納美金債券之新批示，有所商談。討論結果，認爲對當局新措施，應竭誠擁護。惟同時亦擬請當局兼顧經紀人方面事實上之困難，設法予以解除。故希望當局俯准三點要求：（一）經紀人身份保證金三千萬元部份，決遵令全部改以美金債券繳納。惟以時間侷促，要求將繳納期限，亦延長至六月十五日。（二）遞交交易證據金代用品部份，除規定以美金債券繳充外，仍望能俯准亦得以廿六種上市股票或現金繳　抵用。（三）所繳納之美金債券，　能　票面十足抵用。以上要求三點。業由經紀人公會於昨午函　證交當局。</p>

<h3>國棉收購　已近尾聲</h3>
<p>國棉產地收汎，現已落令。本市各紗廠及棉花商號過去在各產地設莊採職者，目前均將結束。近日到貨甚少，同業成交數量甚微，市况沉寂。戰後各地因運輸不能暢達，棉產區距離交通綫較遠者，紗廠花商不敢問津。漢口沙市西安等區域內與鐵路綫附近之若干城市，已爲紗廠棉商集中採購目前存底已罄。其餘鐵路綫較遠者，則因運費甚大，時間又緩，故紗廠花商無法收購。蘇北方面，除南通設莊採辦外，其餘地點，亦多無法採辦。</p>
<h3>紡建售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售一五一二件，全部售予廠商，申購單共九七〇張云。</p>
<h3>皮革俏升</h3>
<p>皮革以黑市金鈔及外匯猛升，各貨俱告暴漲，昨市喊價，咸漲二成以上，交易甚旺。</p>
<h3>國行研究對策　加強布外銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行　討諭如何加强觔布之外銷事宜，書於昨日下午五時許，由該行劉副總裁，召集輸出推廣委會，中國紡建公司，紡管會等代表談話，研究適當對策。聞政府紗布之外銷，向委中國紡建公司代理。該公司近以紡布外銷後，外匯結售予國行，折扣頗大。復以南洋方面，最近紗布市價不振，以致出口結果，所獲尚低於該公司牌價三分之一。如虧損仍由公司負擔，則對代理外銷業務，深感難於維持。談話結果，決由國行，輸出會，紡建公司，紡管會等，各派代表晋京，與經濟部治商該項虧損負擔之誰屬問題，俾便加強紗布之外銷云。</p>
<p>又訊：據悉：中國紡建公司目去年開始外銷紗布以來，轍出貨物金額，在美金五百萬元以上。輸出目的地，有香港，暹羅，仰光，新加坡，菲律賓。爪哇，伊蘭，埃及，希腦等地。其中以輸住香港及暹羅兩地佔多云。</p>
<h3>銀根緊迫紗布均疲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市以銀根突告緊俏，客帮納意停頓，一般凈多穫利出籠，又兼紡建公司開紗，籌碼寬裕，喊價遂趨疲軟。四一一支豐監鳳紗價爲一千三百四十五萬元，比週六下挫二十萬元，一一十支雙馬七百八十萬，軋小二十五萬元。惟粗紗因供源較少，市較堅穩。紡建開售之紗價，與上期相彷。　昨日棉布市情，因客胃呆滯，且有吐售，市上銀根告緊，檯面轉賣不弱。做開十二磅龍頭細布最後價爲三十二萬三千元，彩球二十九萬五千元，比週六跌落一萬四五千元。其他五福藍鷄無牌等細布，一律軋降一萬至一萬五千元。漂布細斜嗶嘰　市亦趨疲，惟色貨元布藍布花布府綱及低檔士林布較爲挺　。</p>
<h3>產地報價回漲　食米略見挺升　民食調配會改今日成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨因逢週一，店胃較健，疲勢稍轉，去路復活。加以產地報價回堅，貨主不肯輕易脫手，故市面略有起色。南北兩市塲共到貨八千三百五十一石七斗一升，高白粳做價四十二萬元，薄稻四十一萬五千元至四十二萬元。</p>
<p>關於我國政府向還羅緬甸兩地採購食米情形，茲據　央信託局發表消息：昨日有華綸公司惠民輸由暹羅裝到食米六二三噸，今日遠洋公司遠洋輸由暹羅裝到一五〇〇噸，後日有竇隆洋行濱當（Rintong）輸，由織甸裝到二五〇〇噸，十六日招商海辰輸，亦將由暹羅裂到七千噸。　麫粉昨略有參差，本粉洋粉挺定之局，統粉因醬園去化香燥，轉升二三千元。麩皮新來登塲已近，消化仍然冷淡，微挫三五百元。豆餅聞營口大批南下，頓形軟化，收市急轉直下，軋跌二三千元。黃豆立定，茶豆成交極少，高貨平定，中下修削三五千元。赤豆到源湧旺，去化閒散，市形平痰，芝蔴高貨洋莊續動，仍居挺站，中下油廠納胃平常，依然平庸。生仁去胃活絡，步砌三五千元。紅糧暫平，苞米靑島北洋動辦，猛進萬元。豇豆彷彿，新蠶豆消路平平，市勢着疲新元麥昨日初見。油市靑島來貨接續，店胃平平。生油回挫萬元，豆油無變化，淸油平正，蔴油略堅，新菜子新蠶豆新大麥新元麥，均已逐步見新。　民食調配委員會，預定昨日成立，但昨據社會局糧食課士口課長稱，民食調配會籌備工作，大致就緒，因吳兼主委開先趁此次晋京出席物價會議之便，特與糧食部等有關機關，接洽有關該會一切事宜，現因此事留京進行，故昨日未能如期返滬，將延至今晨返滬，調配會乃不得不改期於今日下午，在山東旅滬同鄕會正式成立。</p>
<h3>紡建變更配紗辦法　紗號業六月起停配</h3>
<p>紡建公司，自六月份起，對配給各廠商棉紗已略有變更，蘇公司以紡管會自四月份起停止收購民營廠援紗，紗源减少，自六月份起，對紗號及染織業之絲光組，請購棉紗者，暫予停止。又針織業手襪組及手織組購紗，自六月盼起，改由管公會統　額領購，公平分配？外埠棉織業公會已登記者，每月限購紗一次，以該月之第三星期之星期三爲配售日期，電工織帶，駝絨，毛織，均由公會統購，原登記各一律停配。</p>
<h3>麵粉廠業壽組貸款收麥機關</h3>
<p>第四區麫粉業公會，向糧食部四聯總處，要求收麥貸款三千二百億元，本市各廠佔二千四百億元，但迄未核准。茲悉：糧食部對該業貸款，已定有具體辦法，對上海各廠，規定須將由貸款收麥之各廠，共同組織一委員會，所有貸款及收購小麥事宜，由該會統一辦理，然後以收購之小麥，依照各廠生產量，按磨粉機比例分配。其貸款則由中農，中國，交通等行局組織辦理。至對外埠各廠，決責由中農銀行負責調查審核後貸放。</p>
<p>糧部此一辦法，已通知本市各粉廠，該業已於昨日一度集議，決先籌組貸款收麥機構，其組織規定，本市申請貸款各廠派代表一人爲當然委員，設常務會員五人，主任委員一人。委員會之下設辦事處，委派正副處長各一人，以處理日常事務。處長之下分設貸款，小麥，總務，儲運四課，聞該會一二日內即可成立。</p>
<h3>糖價續見上揚</h3>
<p>昨糖市因台幣比率又增，趨勢續緊。公會劃盤，秘魯砂現貨初爲五十三萬〇五百元，後爲五十四萬二千元，棧單貼價上午九萬四千元至十萬〇五六千元。下午十萬〇七千元，鬆至九萬五千元。四半車白棧單爲十四萬元至十四萬五千元，三半車白現貨初爲五十一萬五千元，後爲五十三萬元至五十三萬五千元。二四粗白現貨五十八萬元，二〇中砂白現貨四十八萬五千元至四十九萬五，棧單貼價爲十三萬元。興化白開價爲四十七萬元至六萬五千元，次四十五萬三千元，與赤三十六萬五千元，計百數十簍。刁靑二百餘包三十萬元至三十萬〇五千元，溫靑數十簍，二十八萬三千元，提靑三十三四萬元，順德靑三十一二萬元，僅數十件交易</p>
<h3>捲菸去化呆頓</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，晨開同業門莊帮有添辦，做價微昂。旋以囤戶出籠，外埠同行轉賣，喊價逐步下游。午後市氣更軟，塲中又傳永泰和派配大英烟消息，致去化呆頓。最後十支大英烟價又小至六百九十五萬元，老刀小至五百九十萬元，其餘華商烟則稱回堅。至聽頭烟市面，因霉令無關，不乏需求，故價仍堅穩。</p>
<h3>又一銀樓歇</h3>
<p>小東門裘天寶仁記銀樓，亦繼方天寶之後，宣佈結束，對職工解散金問題，亦在商洽，一特協調，即結束營業云。</p>
<p>南京路方天賣銀樓昨日開始拍賣底貨，一待售罄，即行收歇。但對職工解散金之爭持，尚在繼續談判中。</p>
<h3>陳茶銷虧賠甚鉅　國行允序補救</h3>
<p>中國茶業聯營公司總經理壽景偉，爲去歲陳茶外銷及本年茶貸事，特晋京向四聯總處磋商，昨自南京返滬。據稱：去年陳茶七萬據下週初可評價完畢，評價標準，以美國紐約英國倫敦法屬北菲三地爲準，銷售方法，由協和洋行。汪裕泰·華茶·中國茶業聯營公司等負責，分別向國外各該公司聯號出售。其結匯方式，如以一二〇〇〇元計算，茶商將虧賠甚鉅，國行當局已允設法補救，官匯與黑市匯間之差額，至本年茶貸部份，中農已貸出廿一億元，數量固少，而手續亟待簡化。貸款原定平水四十萬元，屯漢五十萬元，祁門六十萬元等三級，茶商要求提高至八十·九十·一百三級，當局允以七十·八十·九十分爲三級貸放云。</p>
<p>又訊：屯溪內銷茶通常在立夏前後開盤，每擔五十萬元，　跌至四十五萬元，現在內銷茶收　時期已　，　有亦在囤戶手中，至外銷茶依照茶業公會登記，有製菜商百餘家之多，厥以中農貸款條件限制綦嚴，而滬上陳茶尚少出路，以致各茶商咸有觀望。按中晨原訂辦法，須自贊收購毛茶三百擔，方可申請貸款。最近經茶商一再請求，將標準降至一百擔後，開始籌備者，始較踴躍，據聞已有四十餘家着手收購毛茶，價約在三十萬以上云。</p>
<h3>漢口做價上漲</h3>
<p>足度白油滬市以外銷不動，大盤昨市喊便稍升，每市　喊六十二萬元，無甚做開，但零售甚旺。漢口廣帮收購愈烈，下市電報爲五十一萬五千元，做開頗多，市况至堅，價望再高，聞香港黑市價每擔可售一百十五萬元。</p>
<h3>桂圓略有轉機</h3>
<p>雜路桂國因去化平淡，疲而不振，但產價因貨稀，始終未小。最近泉洲來訊，成本超出申市廿餘萬元，故不易轉鬆。昨號方開出二百餘件，貨身較遜，價爲一百〇五萬元，高貨還一百十五萬元，尚未成交。</p>
<h3>蘇常五縣布廠　聯合請求救濟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕無錫，常州，蘇州，江陰，常熟等五縣布廠，以迭次要求配紗，未獲要領，而目前工人生活費指數，又告激升，深感處境艱困爰於日前在滬召開五縣布廠業聯合談話會，出席各縣代表吳振珊王德潤等十四人，討論經過，決定（一）申請配紗問題，自本日起，除發表宣言外，並將分向中國紡建公司，紡管會等請願。同時將會同五縣勞資，向經濟部陳部長，及各有關機關呼籲請願。（二）工人生活費指數驟漲，內地布廠不堪負担。惟內地生活程度，與滬地不同，故應由各縣自約該地勞方，會同當地主管機關，商討符合實際之辦法，以大約等於滬市指數之五成爲原則。（三）分呈行政院，財政部，經濟部，及四聯總處作緊急呼籲，以准用廠產機器作抵爲原則。</p>
<h3>人絲賣多於買　市價一路瀉　廠經喊價稍堅成交不多</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲開盤喊價仍維持上週六原盤，一二〇號高山有光，最大喊二千〇七十萬元，後因賣多於買，遂致節節下降，收盤價爲二千萬元。下午受股市下跌影饗，人心更虛，且亳無實銷，以致一路傾瀉。午後即跌進二千萬元關內，最後喊九百卅萬元，比上週六慘跌一百廿萬元。東洋金三馬等均隨之下降，七五號半光减價亦小去一百萬一元。　廠經昨市交易甚靜，不過喊價反較上週六稍堅，C字等級喊二千八百萬元左有，D字等級討價二千七百萬元，還價二千六百萬元元未成交。高級五擔貨均乏做開，中級另擔稍有交易。成交中檔貨價二千四百五十萬至五百萬元，高級另擔做二千五百五十萬至六百萬元，均有三四日期頭。中級次者喊二千三百五十萬元，干經另擔喊一千八百五十萬元，但殊少成交。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨穩中帶軟，大誠被面做開九百五十五萬元，華强被面九百四十萬元有成交。大誠格子璧縐開市做三萬五千七百元，一度喊到六千元，亦略有成交，最後又低，回喊五千七百元，比上週六軋短二百元之譜。人絲貨華錦縐及羽紗，昨做一萬七千五百元，比上週六喊價稍短，盛杭等貨均無甚上落。</p>
<h3>證交經紀人　認購美金債券</h3>
<p>自財經兩部通知證交，將本證據金代用品部份必須改以美金債券繳納後，聞經紀人等爲解決當前困難，並便利客戶交易起見，擬籌設經紀人認購美金債券保管委員會，由每一經紀人認購美金債券一萬元，交付保管委員會保管。再根據證交存帳額，拆放予經紀人應用，今後之遞延交易，當可照常進行云。</p>
<h3>夾板上漲</h3>
<p>昨木材板上漲，因廠方工資增加，廠盤均上升二成，其餘木材尚平。</p>
<h3>中央信託局　恢復配售人絲</h3>
<p>中信局代售之人造絲，前以其配價與市價相去甚遠，天橋一種，市價升至一千八九百萬，而配價仍爲五百三十萬，殊不合理，特報請政院另行核定價格。上週該局已得政院批示，天橋核定每箱爲九百八十萬，東洋，金三馬，孔雀，地球，核定爲九百六十萬，高山，早日核定爲九百四十萬，該局奉令後，特於昨（二日）恢復配售，本市絲織業三百一十五家，事前共申請一千七百八十箱，但核定結果，僅配出一百七十八箱，全照新價結付。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員會，昨（二日）第二十九次配售人絲，絲織業申請者，共三百十五家，均按上年十二月份配魯總額，以十分之一配出，計一百七十八箱。</p>

<h3>警民合作　禁絕烟毒</h3>
<p>— 宣鐵吾</p>
<p>離開六三禁烟紀念日已經一世紀又八年了，然而我們仍須爲禁姻而呼號，爲禁姻而工作，眞不能不使人有萬分的感慨！</p>
<p>一部中國的禁姻史，也就是一部中華民族爲反抗國際帝國主義者侵略和剝削的鬥爭史，在一百餘年前，由於禁姻而引起的鴉片戰爭，是帝國主義轟開中國閉關自守政策的第一砲，也是使中國成爲國際帝國主義者的次殖民地的第一步，自此以後，中國沿海的門戶－各重要的通商口岸，在不平等條約的束縛之下，完全在帝國主義者的魔手掌握之中；因此以後，鴉片，紅丸，白麪，海洛英，就繁榮市面的藉口之下，大量的由沿海各城市流入全中國，成爲帝國主義者榨取中國人民的金錢，麻痺中國人民神經的最毒辣的武器！</p>
<p>由於滿淸政府的懦弱與無能，使中國第一次，也是最重要一次的禁姻工作，遭受了失敗，並且付出了慘重的代價。</p>
<p>於是近百年來，一般覺醒的中華民族的優秀兒女，不但要爲民族的復興和國家的獨立而戰鬥，並且要爲姻毒的禁絕而戰鬥；不但要向國際主義者鬥爭，而且要向帝國主義統治殖民的重要工具－鴉片而鬥爭：爲民族復興國家獨立的鬥爭固然是非常艱苦的，但對鴉片的鬥爭，也可以說是對帝國主義者加給中國人民－尤其是租界人民精神上，意識上，甚至日常生活上的桎梏和影響的鬥爭，却更爲艱苦！</p>
<p>近五十年來，在中華民國之父－孫總理及其繼承者蔣主席的英明卓絕的領導之下，中華民族的優秀兒安從辛亥革命，北伐到抗日戰爭的勝利，已經掙脫次殖民地的地位，一躍而爲强國之一，這就是說我們對帝國主義者的鬥爭已取得了勝利。然而不平等條約早在戰時即已取消，而租界收復已近兩年，而帝國主義者加給中國人民－尤其是租界人民精神上，意識上，日常生活上的桎梏和影響（鴉片即爲其中之一）却並沒有隨不平等條約的取消和租界收復而肅淸。</p>
<p>烟毒對於吸染者的危害是多麽的深遠，不僅危害自己，而且害及兒孫，上海之所以較其他各地姻民爲多的原因。在起先是由於租界的包庇，中國政府的禁令無法推及；及後至淪陷時期，毒化政策是敵對僞華重要策略之一；而租界中間向多有錢有閒以享樂爲人生目的之輩，於是鴉片就與此單結成不解之緣。收復以後，雖經當局三令五申佈吿勸導，甚至懲處嚴罰，但是由於戒絕烟毒，非有極大之毅力和決心不可，非有忍受姻癮襲來時之痛苦的耐心不可，而這種決心和耐心正是一般吸染者所最缺乏的，所以上海收復雖近兩年，而姻毒迄未能禁絕，</p>
<p>在目前的先進各國中，鴉片僅作爲醫療上的藥品，在國際都市的上海，仍有呑雲吐霧吸染姻毒的人，這不僅是上海的恥辱，而且是全中國的恥辱，我們要使上海成爲現代化的都市，要使上海成爲中國的代表，我們必須在最短的期限內，肅淸上海的姻毒，把上海從烏烟癔氣的毒氛中拯救出來！</p>
<p>在政府當局，應將肅淸姻毒列爲中心工作之一，對於製，售，販，運姻毒的人，嚴加懲處，但是要使每一個市民不吸姻毒，則非全市人民均能配合當局的決策，加以協助不可。</p>
<p>大家或許要懷疑，厲行禁政是警察局的工作，爲什麽要人民協助呢；無權的市民對於禁姻工作又如何能够協助呢？不錯，禁烟是警察局的責任，但是警察局要善盡這個責任，實在非全市市民的協助不可，至於協助的具體辦法，可以從下述兩點做起：</p>
<p>一·勸吿戒姻，不論他是你的親人，眷屬，朋友，同鄕，鄰居…………祇要他是吸染姻毒的人，你就應誠懇地加以勸吿，向他說明鴉片的害處，同時吿訴他吸染姻毒是一種犯法的行爲，要使吸染者受你的勸告而能立志戒絕。</p>
<p>二·密吿檢舉，吸染姻毒的人，就是社會的害蟲，這些害蟲的存在，不論對國對家，於公於私，均無益處，所以對於那些不聽忠吿的姻民，我們要向當局檢舉，由政府來强迫勒戒。決不可因爲親戚朋友而有所姑息，因爲姑息的結果，終是害了你的親朋而已。至於那些製運販售姻毒的人，更是社會的罪人。每一個市民聽到有製運販　的消息，就應該向當局密吿，凡因密吿而破案的，政府均有獎金。</p>
<p>我相信，在警權業經統一了的現在，在政府當局按照以往一貫的辦法積極努力之下，如能獲得一般市民的切實帮助，上海的姻毒，一定可以在最短期內肅清的！</p>

<h3>禁烟與建國</h3>
<p>— 方治</p>
<p>今天（六三）是一百另八年前林則徐先生在虎門焚燬姻土的紀念日，在這建國工作正始基邁進，千頭萬緒，一切需待我們加緊推進和努力的今天，我們來紀念先哲，我們一方面要增加禁姻建國，希賢媲美的決心，而一方面更該鑑古知今，加强我們發奮自强的觀念。我們知道，每個人欲求個人事業的發揚，首先要有健康的身體，充沛的精神，所謂「一分精神，一分事業」。推而廣之；一個國家的富强，民族的興盛，也非先有强健的國民不可，所謂强國必先强民，而强民必先強種。世界上沒有一個國家，國民貧弱多病而國家能獲致富强興盛的。</p>
<p>鴉片自從淸道光末年那時淸廷內政腐敗國力疲弱，因此印度的鴉片就投我國人所好，大量運華，其流毒之巨，爲害之烈，可以說有甚於飛機大砲，他不但可以使個人精神萎靡，事業頽廢，甚至可以使一個國家亡國滅種，故林公則徐當年曾大聲疾呼，「此禍不除，則十年後無可用之兵，無可籌之餉」，在八年抗戰中，敵人在我淪陷地區，到處製造烈性毒品，如嗎啡，海洛因，紅丸，白面等，並公開設館，強迫我同胞吸食，其用意則在使我中華民族，變作烟民姻鬼，奄奄一息不能繼續抗戰，迫使我亡國滅種，因此當時主席曾剴切昭示：「我們必須一面抗戰，一面禁姻」，而今天建國工作，「任重道遠」其艱難更倍於抗戰，尤須侮一靑年，每一同胞，有强健的體魄，充沛的精神，然後才能發奮圖强，担當大任，故我們今天爲加速建國工作更該加强禁姻。</p>
<p>然而，禁姻工作，至今歷時百年以上，仍然不能澈底，販毒吸毒新聞，還是偶見報端，這不但給人以疲憊之感，甚且使一般人對禁姻政策加以懷疑，考其原因，除一般地方政府，對中央禁姻法令，不能認眞奉行，大多不免敷衍塞責，使禁烟工作進入頑皮狀態，而主要原因，猶在於一般沾染姻毒同胞，缺乏自覺，不能有昨日死今日生的決心，甚至設計規避，秘密吸食，自甘墮落，同時，一般同胞，也沒有認　禁姻工作，關係國家存亡，民族興衰，人人應協助政府，努力推行，祇管「各掃門前雪」，不能勇於檢舉，甚且有由於家族親故關係，帮同隱蔽，這也是使政府禁姻工作推行不能澈底的原因。</p>
<p>此外，還有上面已經提到的，八年抗戰，敵人在我淪陷區裏的普遍毒化政策，使得我們今天收復之後，禁姻工作，要從頭做起，同時共產黨在所謂「解放區」裏，至今仍然廣種鴉片，並利用無知人民，偸販偷運，不惜毒化同胞，破壞政令，藉以課稅養兵，割據池方，反叛政府，因此使得整個禁姻工作，阻滯不前，我們今天紀念先哲，應該認淸病癓，針對現狀，沾染烟毒的同胞，要有昨日死今日生，重作新民的決心，自動悔戒，而一般同胞，更須認淸烟禍流毒之烈，本占人訓人勸善規過的做人態度，勇於檢舉，並一致起來，對武裝叛亂的共產黨，要他放下武器，停止割據地方，破壞政令的行爲，取消所謂「解放區」，一個國家不容兩種不同番號的軍隊，一個國家不容有二個政府，應該即日還軍於國，還政於民，使國家軍令政令，獲得統一，而澈底，剷除流毒我國百餘年的烟禍。</p>
<p>主席曾昭示我們：「我以十二萬分懇切至誠希望全國同胞，必須以抗戰殺寇的同樣精）神，同心戮力，協助政府，實施禁姻政策，每一個人都把禁姻認爲自己的責任，我們今天，應該警惕着元首這一訓示，加強我們自强奮發的觀念，負起我們自己的責任，一致努力剷除姻毒，剷除一切足以妨害禁姻建國的工作反動力量，而完成我們三民主養中國的建設。</p>
<h3>浙贛路沿綫行（上）　復活了的東南大動脈全貌</h3>
<p>— 杭州五月廿九日快訊　本報記者黃行天</p>
<p>蜿蜒在浙江，江西兩省的山地間，溝通了粤漢，京滬抗甬　條鐵路的浙贛鐵路，是東南的一條大動脈；它不但解決了「步履維艱」的行旅困難，使沿綫土產有了外銷和發展的機會，而且更流通了浙　兩省民生必需品　和米的交換，所以浙贛鐵路在東南一帶人民的生活中，是有看極大的重要性。由於抗戰時期的澈底破壞，使這條肩負着重任，爲抗戰盡過大力的動脈復員困難了。經費和材料的缺乏，使兩年多來的復員，雖經路局的拚命趕修，也祇不過正綫通到金華，支綫通到蘭谿而已。我所謂「拚命」，倒不是誇張，路局的員工，在經費材料的可能限度下確是以最大的速率，以平均每天二·六公里的釘道成績打破了築路工程史的記錄的。他們的最高記錄，曾到過四·二公里，如果任何一種復員建設工作都能以這種精神來幹下去，那麼一定可以大大地减少了我們底國土上的破碎的殘蹟了。</p>
<p>現在浙贛鐵路的全綫復軌工程，已成立了諸衢·饒向·潯南·南春·春株五工程處，分別進行復軌工作。雜曁衢州段，共長一八八·五〇〇公里，金華與蘭谿支綫長一二二·七七公里，係由諸衢段工　處負責主修；此兩段內共有大　八座，小橋十六座，票房房屋一等者一座，三等者三座四等者四座，都已完成通車了。目前正在趕修中的是金華衢州段長八十餘公里，經敵人澈底破製而待修復者有大橋十一座，小橋十五座，涵管一百十七座，明渠座，三等票房二座，四等五座，及其他設備等，工程艱鉅。爲了趕工起見，路局已將全綫一百公尺以上的大橋劃爲三區，分別成立大橋公程處。第一區設金華，督修金衢間的金華江·靈山港·東蹟江等五橋；各橋橋墩，現已完成百分之九十。第二區設梁家渡，督修上饒·南昌間的上畹港，鄧家港·撫河支流等大橋；第三區設樟樹，督修南昌·萍鄕間之浹溪·山前·贛江支流，袁山等大橋。而以金衢段橋工最艱巨。記者曾在金華往觀金華江大橋的修復工程。該橋全長二八二·九四五公尺，高十八公尺，計十二孔。抗戰時敵機一炸再炸，猶未炸毀，後因國軍內撤，始自行炸毁六孔橋墩。現在已修好了，祗是鋼樑，鋼筋，猶付缺如。據負責人王工程師語記者：「今年天氣好，水位低，所以修築甚便，祇是器材缺乏。我們修第九號橋墩時，因抽水機不敷，祇能借用農家的水車同時應用，也化了廿多天工夫。如果鋼樑沒有，我們祇能用木樑，改成半永久性的了。」</p>
<p>記者從杭州搭車到金華，閘谿，經壓了已復活的浙贛路的全程，覺得金蘭支綫行車最穩，速度也快。諸曁金華段的情形也還好；而杭諸段的行車顚簸甚劇，每小時僅行二十公里。所以從杭州到金華全程一九〇公里，而行車竟達八小時。主要的是因爲杭諸段用七十磅鋼軌釘道，且一部份枕木業已腐朽；至金蘭段則用九十磅重軌，枕木全新。「爲了行車的安全」，路局的章專員宗堯對記者說：「我們已在逐漸修整杭諸段的路軌，但由於村料的缺乏，目前還祇能零星抽換；一面則設法加固其中三十六座比較薄弱的橋樑，以便行駛載重四十噸以上的車輛。路局爲了配合全國建設鐵路交通網的發展，對於這條够一横貫東南各省的交通要道，決擬逐步復興，充實配備，配合機務·加强這輸效力；並擬在蕭山建築方園二百畝的大機廠，自製另星材料配件。目前最嚴重的是車輛的問題。杭揑段僅有三等客車六輛代客車三輛；杭蘭段通車後，路綫展長一倍，客運貨運日增，雖經交部撥到十部份貨車，並招商承造客車六輛仍不敷用。爲了應付目前客運已在靑島向津浦路撥借客軍廿輛，貨車一百五十輛。如全綫通車，機車，客車，貨車的需要更迫切了。」</p>
<p>杭州蘭谿間的直達車，定本月廿五日起開駛，上海江西間的聯運，已和兩路局商妥了，即可實行。交通部已決定於年內完成浙贛鐵路的全綫通車。在政府的注視和人民的熟切期望中，我們希望浙贛路局的員工們，能繼續金諸段的工作精神，隨時隨地創造新紀錄，把這一條溝通東南各省的經濟和文化的大動脈，迅速地恢復起來！</p>
<h3>大大蘭谿縣小小金華府</h3>
<p>「大大蘭谿縣，小小金華府」，這句話在戰後又成爲現實的寫照了。列車駛過麥穗金黄的田野和細葉如針的棗樹林，到了金華，第一個印象是金華保有了她底樸實和淳厚的特性，但已消失了她底昔日的繁華。從民國廿七年起迄三十年，那是金華的黄金時代，「小小金華州」遠遠超過了「大大蘭谿縣」，人口增加到十萬以上，成爲抗戰中國東兩唯一的吞吐口，成千成萬的小商人，單帮客，走私者往來不絕地到了這裏，熙熙攘地擠滿了二百多家臨時造起來的旅館，把大量的物資從杭州，從上海，從寗波，從整個敵後偷運過封鎖綫，經過這裏，流散到大後方去。那時候，金華眞是一個輝煌的城市。可是正和金華江的變遷一樣，金華江在民廿八年時白浪滔滔，是緊靠着金華的一條正常的河流；民卅年時，水流漸少；到了今日，水淺河廣，中流漲起大片的沙洲，水勢沒有一定的主流，簡直不像一條大江了。而金華，經過敵騎的蹂躪，勝利又剝奪了她底顯要的經濟地位，以致市面衰褪了八倍，人口减少了五倍，又落在蘭谿之後了。因此，有人說：「金華在戰時是一個暴發戶，如今已是一份無法復員的破落人家了」。但我以爲金華的無法復員是暫時的，抗戰已改變了她底古舊的府城的相貌，具有了現代城市的氣魄和規模，祇要浙贛路全綫通車，更加以積極的建設，金華一定可以回復她底靑春的。</p>
<p>金華的經濟價値雖低落了，但她的地方經濟還是可以自給自足的。稻穀年產一·七九五·〇〇〇担，小麥一五四·〇〇〇担，大豆三〇·〇〇〇担，雜糧四九八·〇〇〇祖，糧產不僅可以自足，且有少量的出口。柏油年產一二四〇〇担，桐油八八〇〇担，是重要的特產，全部出口，火腿雖以金華名，但重要產地在東陽（二〇〇〇〇担）和富陽（五〇〇〇担），金華不但產量微，而且市上還買不到好的上蔣腿。此外茶葉，石灰，佛手，茉莉，毛筆，紙傘，爆竹也是金華的重要特產。</p>
<h3>浙東的文化城</h3>
<p>與其說金華是浙東的政治經濟城市，不如說她，是浙東的文化城。現在金華有國立英士大學一所　，省立金華中學一所，私立作新，成美，三五中學三所，八婺女子中學一所，簡易師範一所，省立金華農業職業學校一所。中心國民學校廿五所，保國民學校二〇二所，私立小學二所，初小七五所。在社會敎育方面，有省立民敎館一所，民衆講座二所。跟踪着學校的衆多而來的書店，有商務，勝利等九家，可以買到上海最新出版的雜誌，但新書是非常貧瘠的。報紙僅八開「導報」一種，反而比浙東其他的二等縣來得規模小，內容差。這是不正常的壞現象。幸而可以看到當天的滬杭各報，可以稍解精神食糧的飢渴。</p>
<p>英士大學在浙東的文化界是一朶瑰麗的奇葩，但最近，英大的學潮部打破了文化城的寗靜，並且震嚮了全國。學潮的焦點在乎學生不滿意簡陋的臨時學舍，要求遷移至南京或杭州。記者爲此，特往參觀。全校一共祗有四個院，却分佈在五個區域上，而且祗有工學院是集中在一個地方的，其他都是星羅棋佈，零亂不堪；單是一個　學院，教室和學生宿舍竟分散在五個地方，其爲學生之不滿，當爲必然之事。主要的原因，是在於學校沒有自己的房子，祗能租借民房，利用寺，廟，和家祠；有一部份的租期還快要滿了。房子的簡願，是上海人所想像不到的，石灰的牆壁手碰上去，就會搖動，沒有電燈，沒有玻璃窗，院長的辦公室簡直和工程師的臨時房間一樣。所以對於校舍，全校的師生都表示萬分的不滿。據現在的代理校長工學院院長周尙，吿訴記者：「本校現有圖書八萬餘册，儀　設備不在普通大學之下，可做任何一種實騐。而金華的環境幽靜，民情淳厚，是適宜於專心求學的地方。所以問題的焦點不在遷校，而是需要一個永久性的自己的校舍。如果化十廿億的遷移費把學校搬到並無現成校舍的別地去，不如在金華自造校舍好。」我覺得周院畏的話是很對的。事實上，金華的永久校舍早經設計，估價需費三百億，現在物價高漲，約需六百億了。如果敎育部眞是要完成他的全國大學網的計劃，那末應該先把這筆經費早點撥下來才是。</p>
<p>蘭谿純然是一個商業性的城市，富陽江的水利，給他造成了水運中心的優越地位，市面的繁榮，大大地超過了「金華府」。現有人口二七八·八二六〇名，平均每口耕地近二畝，年產稻穀二百萬担，麥卅餘萬担，雜糧七萬餘祖；主要特產有柏油三五〇〇〇担，蜜棗五〇〇〇祖，桐油五〇〇〇祖，楊梅三〇〇〇祖，火腿五〇〇〇担。出口火腿約有六萬四千只，桐油五千担，柏油一萬五千担；進口則以民生日用品爲主。縣城中有玻璃廠和棉織廠各一所，雖產量不甚豐；家庭工業，則以紡織業爲主，經營人數約有一萬人，全縣田賦配額八八三七六石，已徵八〇二六六石，百分比達百分之九十一。各類捐稅配額達八〇五·一五〇·〇〇〇元，已征收的却衹有百分之十·九。但無論如何，比起金華來，蘭谿是繁榮的多了。</p>
<h3>金華洞遠勝七星岩</h3>
<p>北山名勝，爲昔道家所謂「卅六洞天，七十二福地」之一，著於唐，盛菸宋，爲浙東景物最奇秀的地方。到過金華的人，總覺得桂林的山水雖甲天下，但桂林的七星岩却不及金華洞遠甚了。金華洞爲雙龍，冰壺，朝眞三洞的總名，位於北山（即金華山），距金華縣城廿六里處。從金華坐汽車可到羅店，全途八公里，十五分鐘即可到達。由羅店而北，僅十華里，沿溪而行，山巒巒起伏水聲潺潺；風景秀麗，比起杭州的九溪十八澗來，那就好多了。沿途並有安期生故里，宋康懿秦國長公主墓，佛壽亭等古蹟。</p>
<p>雙龍洞坐東朝西，位金華山西北麓，高金華城一千零五十尺，與冰壺。朝眞洞毗連。外洞口有天然石乳龍首二個，突出洞口，現已失其一。洞口極大，廣深各十餘丈，光綫充足，可容兩三百人，有「呂先生藏身」，北斗星窠，仙梅，石雲，石道人等景，都是水乳岩的作品。外洞深處有穴，如蟆頤，淸泉從中流出來，水旱亦不會涸。溯泉而進，即爲內洞，泉上有極大的平底岩石，離水面僅尺許，故由外洞至內洞遊覽，必須仰臥在小舟上，燃汽油燈引路，以繩引舟而入。在這一刹那，人底精神是異常緊張的，必須屛息靜臥，眼看着大片的岩石緊靠着鼻尖掠過面部，心臟急跳着，帶着恐怖和好奇的心理，宛如在穿渦進梅花源的山洞，或是在駛向另一個奇異的世界。內洞確是一個奇異的地方，其深廣大於外洞，而曲折多奇，且全洞無光，必須燃燈引路，進洞仰視，即有黄靑二石龍，張吻擎爪，蟠纏左右，故名雙龍，　壁琳瑯，有如蒼龍之飛舞，有如獅虎之崢嶸，有如仙如佛，有如衣如履，有若起若臥，據宋謝翱金華洞人物古蹟記歸類云，凡五十七種。洞壁猶有唐宋人題名石刻，而以萬曆四年刻石者爲最明晰，內洞夏寒冬暖，記者在洞外單衣而汗，到洞內夾衣猶未覺暖呢！</p>

<h3>讀文天祥詩</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>假如單就軍事上的成敗來說，文天祥的事業可說是毫不足道，經過的時間旣短，又祇有幾次一接觸便失敗的小戰事。他是一個純粹的文人，以前祗做過幾任地方官。賈似道當國，他不願進仕，三十六歲時闢文山新居，頗有退隱的意思，自己說：「欲俟四十三歲，即請老致仕，如錢若水故事。」乙亥（二一七五），七月七日起兵勤王，八月間到抗州，次年正月，元兵已圍臨安。正月二十日，入元營講和。二月八日給元兵強迫北行。二十九日在鎭江逃脫，經過無限艱險，四月間逃到福建。次年，輾轉到江西南部起兵，五月間開始活動，六月間曾經得遇兩次小勝。八月二十七日兵潰於空坑。那樣的戰事簡直不堪元兵一擊。「八月，黎貴達以正兵千人，民兵數千，次鍾步。遇北軍，民兵驚潰，未旬日，汴（張汴），賞（趙時賞），深（趙孟瀠）率民兵數萬逼贛城，北軍以百餘騎衝之，衆奔潰。」（見紀年錄）經這次潰敗後，又輾轉由福建入廣東。次年六月到過崖山朝幼帝。十二月二十日在海豐給張弘範的部兵所俘。以上所述，就是這位千古偉人在政治和軍事上的全部活動。就功利的觀點來看，這些活動眞是太渺小了，亳不足稱。我特別表明出來，以見偉大人物的事業並不一定建立在功利的基礎上。</p>
<p>我國文化有一極偉大的精神，所謂「知其不可爲而爲之。」就形勢上計算，明知道事已無可爲，但這一條心放不下去，無論如何總要做纔能心安。於是把成敗利鈍的計算完全拋開，也更不作虛幻的希望，祗是照這一條心認爲應該做的做下去。他在江西起義時，「其友止之日：今大兵之道鼓行，破畿郊，薄內地。君以烏合萬餘赴之，何異驅羣羊而搏猛虎。天祥日：吾亦知其然也，第國家養育臣庶三百餘年，一旦有急，微天下兵，無一人一騎入關者。吾深恨於此，故不自量力而以身殉之。」——宋史本傳。紀年録自記對博羅的問答：日，「旣知做不得，何必做？」日，「人臣事君，如子事父。父不幸有病，明知不可爲，豈有不下藥之理。盡吾心焉；不可救則天命也。」這兩段話最可以解釋「知其不可爲而爲之」的道理。事情成不成付之天命。祇要應該做的這一道理能够表明，能够傳播，自然有人會繼續做，形勢自然會漸漸改觀。將來總有一天，這一番道理可以表明於天下，也就是這一件事便會成功。驅走元人的，到底是文天祥，陸秀夫，張世傑這幾個人。元朝以古今無四的兵力，縱橫歐亞，無堅不摧，却不能打倒這幾個人。</p>
<p>文天祥重要的作品有「指南錄」，「指南後錄」，「吟嘯集」，「集杜詩」四種。其他的詩則爲未勤王以前的作品，還不足以完全表示他特獨的情調。「指南後錄」從己卯正月十二日過寒丁洋詩起，那時已被元兵所俘，到壬午端午日詩止（這以後還有幾首詩，但年月不詳），先後四年，就在這一年十二月被殺。「吟嘯集」的時間不大可考，約從被執起到辛己（死的前一年），詩數量不多，時間和「指南後錄」綜錯。「集杜詩」共二百首，集杜工部五言句爲五絕，紀亂離經過，成於庚辰年，（死的前二年）。「指南錄」則紀自出使至被逼迫北行，又中途逃脫，輾轉走到溫州的經過。從正月十三到四月八日。自序，「使北營留北關外爲一卷。發北關外歷吳門，毘陵，瓜州，復還京口爲一卷。脫京口趨眞州揚州高郵泰州通州爲一卷。自海這至永嘉來三山爲一卷。」共詩一百七十八首，多七言絕句。各詩多數有序，詳記中間的經過。</p>
<p>古今詩人處境最困厄的莫過於文天祥，他一方面担付國家政治的責任，一方面又度着最窮苦的生活，兩子，六女，都死喪於兵中，被囚四年，終於殉國。囚禁以後，祗是死心塌地，不失臣節，惟求一死罷了。指南　所記的一段時間，則一方面最危　，一方面懷着希望，不敢犧牲了事。這時候的心情纔是最苦惱的。紀事六首，正表示此種心情：「三宮九廟事方危，狼子心陽未可知。若後無人折狂虜，東南那個是男兒？」（其一）「春秋人物類能言，宗國常因口舌存。我亦瀕危專對出。北風滿野負乾坤。」（其二）「英雄未肯死前休。風起雲飛不自由。殺我混同江外去，豈無曹翰守幽州！」（其六）「英雄未肯死前休」這是何等氣槪！艱難危困，幽囚久繫，無論如何不肯放棄希望。直到宋亡七年，崖山以後五年，終於不屈服，正是從這種氣槪出發的。</p>
<p>二王一首云，「一馬渡江開晋土，五龍夾日復唐天，內家苗裔眞隆準，虜運從來無百年。」因爲抱着這種希望，所以時時作逃脫之計。回京口云，「早作田文去，終無蘇武留，偷生寗伏劍，忍死欲焚舟。逸驥思超乘，飛鷹志脫鞴。登樓望江上，日日數行舟。」後來終於在京口逃脫。替他主持一切的是杜滸。這是一位始終左右文天祥的義土，崖山敗後被執病死。脫京口七絕十二言，寫當時情景眞是無限困苦。到了眞州，和苗再成商議，計盡出兵，懷着興復的夢想，當時有詩云：「南八空歸唐壘陷，包胥一出楚疆還。而今社稷存亡決，祇看元戎進退間。」但是這僅僅是一個夢而已。隨即爲李庭芝所逐。這一無端的誤會，使這位剛鐵肝　的偉人又多歷一番因苦。</p>
<p>出眞州詩三十三歲，響是血淚交迸。比起從京口逃脫，不獨時間更長，而且心情逈異。「秦川痛哭血成川，翻訝中行背可鞭。南北共知忠義苦。平生祇少兩淮緣。」到了這種境地，幾乎以爲是命遝如此了。被逐出城以後，苗再成帶一小隊人護送，原意本是懷疑他，想探查究竟。可是文天祥心心念念，不忘君國，決心向李庭芝見面，分辨是非，終於把護送的人感動了，指引去揚州的路：「千金犯險脫施裘，誰料南寇反見警。記取小西門外事，年年上已哭江頭！」「荒郊下馬欲何之！死活原來任便宜。不是白兵生眼孔，一團寃血有誰知？」「吾截吾頭向廣陵，仰天無告可憐生。爭如負命投東海，猶曾乘風近玉京。」到揚州後不得入，而城外幾百里間都是北兵勢力範圍，從行中有四人盜金逃走。幸遇一打柴人，引間道走高沙，高沙道中，遇北兵哨—同行多有死傷。連這樣的鐵石心腸，也說，「痛定思痛，其涕如雨。」稽莊即事五律云：「得心王室故，日夜奔南征。蹈險寗追悔，懷忠寗見明。雁聲連水色，遠山與天平。枉作窮途哭，男兒討死生。」</p>
<p>從高郵，海陵，如皋，轉通州，得到海船，這纔飄海到溫州。可是無論怎樣艱苦，却決不挫掉志氣。即事五律云：「痛哭辭京關，微行訪海門。久無鷄可聽，新有蝨堪捫。白髮應多長，蒼頭少有存。但令身未死，隨力報乾坤。」這一種鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已的心情，才眞是我國志士仁人的精神，因爲有這種精神，無論怎麼不肯承認失敗，也就終久會成量後的心願。至溫州七律云：「萬里風霜鬢已絲，飄審回首壯心悲。羅浮山下雪來未？揚子江頭月照誰？祇謂虎頭非貴相，不圖羝乳有歸期！乘潮一到中川寺，暗讀中興第二碑。」自嘆五律云：「草宿披脊露，松餐立晚風。亂離嗟我在，艱苦有誰同！祖邀關河志、程嬰社稷功。身謀百年事，宇宙浩無窮！」</p>
<p>讀文天祥詩，悽愴沉鬰，眞是令人感慨萬端。我國詩以溫柔敦厚爲主，以比興爲法。關於個人的心情，不大直接發表。做詩的目的，是想從貧賤中求安，所以就像杜甫那樣經歷困苦，也時時以詼儲的態度自解。祇有文天祥却一切不顧，儘量發揮自己的悲憤。這眞是變微之聲。然而，也正如他自己所賦的「正氣」存留在天壤間，使每個讀者都會懦立頑廉，這種作品，充分表現知其不可而爲之的精神，是不能完全用我的詩歌或西洋的悲劇理諭解釋的。（卅六年五月·蘇州）。</p>

<p>不盡波瀾印着萬古的創傷，</p>
<p>一道巨流，一部活的歷史，</p>
<p>經歷了多少變幻滄桑。</p>
<p>你告訴人們：春申君如何豪放，</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血525</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「對不起，我們不把信號放出，他們就得對準這裏進襲了……咱們進屋子去參觀一下罷。」守一　還　見手槍，好像自己是屋主似的，一手開門，一手　開，邀請鶴見　　。</p>
<p>左手一　大房，照噸通佈　，原來是會客室，這時已經空空如也，正中地板上，放着兩塊「榻楊米」，四面燃着好幾隻蚊香，有的已經燒賸一兩圈，有的還剛剛新燃。空氣裏充滿了蚊香和潮霉氣味。兩人只向室內張了張，知道無甚研究，便返身進了對面的起居室和飯間。這間裏倒是滿目琳琅，雜陳斑：一張破桌，幾把破椅，三四舖「楊楊米；一此外，正宗酒，啤酒，和他種酒，有的空了瓶，棄在地上；有的吃賸一些，有許多遠未開瓶；熟魚，炙肉，水菓，麫包，和其他冷食很多，大約也消耗過了不少，地上有些菓皮，骨刺，香煙頭等，倒老　以桌子下面和左近　劃界，並不隨地亂拋；這是日人比較中國人進步的地方；　旦沒有隨地吐痰，　　　　　概是匪　舞的司令部。」笑着談。</p>
<p>樓上，和上廣假三層，也都者了一層，都是空室。只有朝南一間大臥室，地上也有幾舖榻榻米，也燃着好幾隻蚊香圈。還有好幾盒堆在屋角。近窗也有一張桌小，上面有紙筆和兩三本書，還有三四把椅還雜亂堆着一疊衣服，却都是男裝的和服</p>
<p>「這是什麼？」鶴見首先發現靠門一面牆上，有紫色線條的字跡。</p>
<p>「－一朶萍花，一隻喇叭；縛了喇叭，迎走萍花！－」</p>
<p>這四句詩不像詩，謠不像謠的字句之外，還有六個小字　在尾上：「天王老子留字。」</p>
<p>守一看了，「嘆哧」一笑，　着搖頭。</p>
<p>「事情我是明自的，萍子已被救走了只是呌人有些難信。難道這些匪徒們都是死人？……來的只有四位小姐哪；天大本領，總不致於一些不呌人驚覺哪……」鶴見無論如何，相信不過。「認着，牆上字句，說明這裏是兩個人，那隻『喇叭」大概就是喇叭花，也是個女人；縛了起來，大槪準定是敵方一起的哪。…這喇叭花就那們容易對付？喇叭是應該發擊的，爲什麼　喊呌？</p>
<p>一教也猜想不出…只好回去問她們了…」守一搔着頭皮。</p>
<p>「…簡單得很…」後來在百忍莊裏，大家見面，鶴見本着日本敎育，「打破砂罐問到底」的精神，請求子　說明當時援救萍子的情形。子珊骨碌碌轉着兩隻大回眼珠，現在兩隻小酒窩，吱吱喳喳，連笑帶說，「那羣東西，玩兒的空城計；總共只有九個家伙，連那女間諜一共十人－她是假裝一同被擄，想把中村萍子小姐的秘密，設法賺出的－我們到的當兒，本想硬來，慧姐姐不贊成，剛巧碰着鬼子排隊出巡，三鳳零一個，屋十裏廢下兩條笨虫，想是吃醉了；睡得像兩條死猪，呼天大鼾。……</p>
<h3>刈草的姑娘</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>每天，推開那扇朝西的窗子，我總能見　一個烟草的姑娘。</p>
<p>我見她上身穿着一件　花布夾衣，腰裏　團一條深藍布圍裙。一塊淡紅色的手絹插在襟裏。細眉粉險，用鳳仙花的汁水染紅了細小的指甲。</p>
<p>那姑娘總是從圍牆的側門邊蹓進我家園子。進來時兩隻空空的大草蘿掮在右肩，一把發亮的鎌刀揑在左手。邊走邊笑，似乎不勝嬌嗔。却又步步回顧，似乎有些害怕。最後在窗口前望見了我，「小姐！討一點草，……淸脆的聲音像春風一樣溫柔輕徐。</p>
<p>總要到日落西山她方才回去。回去時一担滿滿的靑草，幾乎把根小小的扁担折成彎弓。可是她走的時候還是那麼輕鬆寫意。右臂擋住扁担，左臂靜靜下垂。一步一揮，小巧的嘴巴裏哼着曼妙的村歌。</p>
<p>「這姑娘眞是怪可惜的，假使生長在都市裏呀……」</p>
<p>有一天我忽然這樣幻想起來：我幻想着給那姑娘的靑花布夾衫換成淡綠色綢衣；深藍布圍裙改爲鵝黃呢大衣；插在襟裏的粉紅手帕，換一隻大紅玻璃皮包；再色細狹的眉毛加上一筆，使牠彎彎下垂；再在粉臉上加上巴黎胭脂，小嘴上堡上丹琪唇膏，指甲上抹上鮮紅雪亮的蔻舟；……然而呀——</p>
<p>然而我凄然地笑了。我看見那姑娘的身邊，已不再有嫩綠的靑草，不再有美麗的藍天，不再有淸淸的流水和靜靜的田野，祇有一股渾沌濃黑的煤烟，在把她捲旋，捲旋，捲旋……</p>
<p>又有一次，我從實口裏輕輕减過去：「姑娘！你每天割這許多草回去幹什麼呀？」</p>
<p>「這些草嗎？」她抬起頭來，媽然地笑了：「　我的羊呀！」</p>
<p>多　麗的聲音！可是我思索，思索……突然，我記起來了：那不是和基督釘十字架的前夜，囑咐他最親信的門徒彼得的話：「餵我的羊！」同樣的聲音嗎？</p>
<p>於是我又凄然地笑了。我彷彿看見那姑娘，跟着押在一羣兇惡的兵丁中間，頭戴荊棘冠冕，身披紫色罪袍，背上負着沉重的十字架的基督，在一同向着可怕的「各各他山」走去；那姑娘的臉上滿是眼淚。……</p>
<p>這一天，我關起了那扇朝西的窗子。</p>
<p>我沒有再看過那個刈韋的姑娘，然我時時刻刻在想急她。</p>

<h3>大學教育</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>說起中國的敎育，誰都要搖頭。然而說起中國的大學敎育，却不免要令人吃驚。因爲我們一共有一百九十餘（根據最近胡適的話）所大學之多。照我們敎育發展的此例來說，可謂多得反常了。</p>
<p>現在各大學，不但經濟力量不够，（戰後如此，戰前亦然）就是在人力方面說，也並不充裕。我們此地不想對目前大學敎授們的品學加以褒貶，單是回憶戰前滬上幾個大學的敎授們，就足够使我們「膽戰心驚」了。有一位敎詩詞的不知吳瞿安爲何許人，還有一位敎經濟學的把貶值的貶讀做眨眼睛的眨字。有一位敎社會學的連課文（英文本）都解釋不通，還有一位敎小學的把說文的工作變成了書法課，這些都不過是小笑話，其他還有種種的大笑話，簡直多到不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>毛病就在於我們根本沒有那麼許多足够担任大學敎授的學者，偏偏我們却好高驚遠，要辦那麼許多的大學。爲了要塡充那麼許多大學敎擾的職位，於是祇能（甚至還有不够）担任中學敎師的，都升級而爲大學敎授，祇能（甚至同樣還有不够）祖任小學敎師的，便升級而爲中學敎師。而根本不配祖任敎師的，便不能不被請到小學校和幼稚園去。就我記憶所及，戰前（以上說的都是戰前）有些小學敎師，他們本人就沒有從小學畢業過。我所說的當然不是每個敎師或敎授，　而這樣的人物在敎育界中委實　在少數。試想在這樣人才缺乏的情形之下辦教育，怎樣辦得好呢？這樣的濫竽充數，這樣的敷衍塞責，眼看着大學畢業生越來越多了，然而有用的人才却未見其增加。</p>
<p>一個國家正像一個人，要講學問必須在博大之上建築精深。精深是大學敎育，博大是小學敎育。唯有在眞正普及的小學敎育和中學敎育之上，才能建築健全結實的大學敎育。倘然忽視了這下層的基礎，而徒然講求高深，結果一定不免於失敗。因爲這決不是美輸美奐的高樓大廈，而不過是若有若無的空中樓閣而已。這是戰前的敎訓，我們現在應該有點修改了。</p>
<h3>三言兩語</h3>
<p>— 于靜</p>
<p>這個小婦人中止了喋喋不休，把手放在電燈開關上，問道：「親愛的，今天晚上，一切東西都已安置好了吧？」</p>
<p>在黑暗裏，她的丈夫耐煩地同答道：「太本，除了您之外，別的東西都已關上了。」</p>
<h3>接電費賬單有感</h3>
<p>— 吳德潤</p>
<p>收到了電力公司的「用戶賬單」，帳款部份，竟列了三項名目：第一項是電費；第二項是燃料附加費；第三項，則是市政府·吳德潤·公用事業附加捐百分之十。閒看把它計算一下：電費，每度一百二十元，燃料附加費，却每度附加了二百〇五元。簡直是電費本身的百分之一六二·五。</p>
<p>燃料費的附加，非本月始；而且叨光，亦非如「生活指數」般的月月「調整。」然而，這仍難釋我們的不解。首先，燃料費的附加，以何根據？爲何不併入電費項內計算？（這也許是公用事業，非經當局核准，不能擅自漲價，但我們又懷疑）附加費的計算，以何標準？是否經過當局的准許？</p>
<p>意外地又發現了本月份帳單上，多了幾行紅字，本來對這些「附註」「解釋」之類，是不大注意的。唯其紅色奪目，才引起了我的好奇。</p>
<p>原文：「本公司茲奉經濟部令，凡當局核准之修正電價或附加費，其不及預爲通告者，准予補收，故本公司對於本帳單所包括之用電量，保留增收費用之權。</p>
<p>完了它，不禁又是一陣詫異。保留增收費用之權，」似乎是「史無前例」的新創。</p>
<p>電力供應是公用事業，不能如普通營利事業般的唯利是圖，雖然，燃料的飛漲，開支的浩大，也是誰都知道的事實，但「燃料附加費的名目也許即因此而創立，然而這次的「保留增費權」，也許沒有一個用戶會贊同的，</p>

<h3>遺棄三部曲</h3>
<p>— 虛舟</p>
<p>行將出國至紐約演出「孟姜女」之中會音樂劇團經理鄧士萍，近爲其妻儲晶如以傷害及遺棄罪嫌提起控訴。這原是一樁極平凡的遺葉案，值不得大驚小怪，某報的標題是「經理醜聞」，其實在形形色色的犯罪案中，鄧士萍的「變心」，還够不上算是「醜聞」。某警訓班長拿槍强姦同事之妻，這才是道地的醜聞；馮來扣　充丈夫，强姦同鄕張某之妻，這才是醜聞。而且大致看來，若干醜聞均傳自名門，儘管是高樓大廈。金碧輝煌，其中却頗多藏垢納污之處，人妖案與逆倫案等可爲例證。</p>
<p>但從部士萍的遺棄案，也可以看出在男性中心社會中的女性的悲劇。儲晶如在法庭上說的幾句話，尤值得其他女性注意。下面是直抄某報的記載：</p>
<p>「儲晶如語告記者，當年鄧對伊追求之時，由浙江至日本而轉內地，伊當時知鄧曾遺棄其前藝，故不願相嫁，而鄧竟抱決死之心，曾先後自殺達五次之多，伊並出示照片二張，一張爲本人靑春時代之玉照，亭亭玉立，活潑娟秀，與現在容貌判若雨人。伊告以聞其夫之新戀人，雖有六七人之多，但能如其芳年之玉貌者，實無一人云。言下有不勝今昔之感。……</p>
<p>在男性中心社會中，女性的唯一資本是什麼呢？—靑春。有多少女人在被迫販賣靑春，又有多少女人因淸春業已消逝，失去了保障，終於只好飲泣度日。莎士比亞會說過：「弱者呵，你的名字是女人？」如果女性不能從「憑籍靑春以謀生」的過程中自求解放，則男女平等將永遠只是商品售出，不能因漲價而向顧客追收貨值，上月電費付淸，本月突然追收起上月用電量的增收費用，豈不使用戶蒙受額外的損失。個口號吧，而一切的傷書罪和遺棄罪，看來也將日益增多的吧。在白居易時代，市國的女性已有「人老珠黃」之嘆，時至今日，多少女性却還在爲青春的消逝而頻瑮。這是可悲的。當儲晶如「亭亭玉立」之時，鄧士萍不惜自殺，達五次之多，且從浙江至日本又轉至內地，可以說是「追求能手」了；結婚的時候，儲晶如知對力不可靠，向他要保障，他也熱情豪邁地只給了她一支手槍，說：「沒有別的，一去槍一條命，日後我若對你變心，你可將我打死。」但曾幾何時，儲晶如就不再「亭亭玉立」了，於是鄧士萍也取消了他的諾言，－「新戀人竟有六七人」云。</p>
<p>這樣的故事，社會上多得很，即在同日報紙上，還有一斯「漆行主王錫榮姦棄名閨秀邵文英」的新聞，而且也一樣的是「三部曲」：最初，「王自見邵後，驚爲人，遂思染指」；其後，「王闢室康樂飯店，邵知不妙，退出欲返，王即用强將伊按倒」；結局是「部女投奔，王予峻拒，並迭遭毆辱，身心俱碎」。任何遺棄案，方式雖有小異，程序大致相若。</p>
<p>爲女性計，在「亭亭玉立」的時代，多設想一下未來的生活及遭遇，該是必要的吧。</p>
<p>新知識</p>
<h3>發光的天空廣告</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>聖誕老人乘着雪車　幾集馴鹿拖着，在都市的天空中遊行；人畜和軍上都裝着電燈，在黑夜裏發光頗亮，這是去年耶聖誕的夜裏美國紐約市上空所發見的一種發光天空廣告，可以代表天空廣告的最新發展。這種廣告是用飛機拖進，但是因爲在黑夜，所以看不到飛機。</p>
<p>從前用飛機拖着的天空廣告，只有在白天看到，其形狀好像貼着實心文字的網狀招貼板，欲使此種廣告在黑夜可以看到，必須加以完全不同的設計，上述發光天空廣告的創作者，紐約巴克公司S．S．Pike　Company）新近把「聖誕老人乘鹿車」的發光廣告的製法和拉放法完全發表，現略述於后：</p>
<p>這聖議節廣告，用四百英尺長的繩拖着。本身長一百五十英尺，高十五英尺，上面裝着一千我只電燈，用飛機裏的發電機供人所需的電流。所裝的電綫，頭緒紛繁，如果理成一根直綫，就要有三千英尺長。</p>
<p>製此種廣告的第一步手讀，係用織物製成一個所需大小的網，每隔若干距離裝一橫棒做繃機撐物。然後把網平攤在地上，裝上鹿車和人形的帆布製輸廓。再在這些帆布條上裝電燈座，每隔一英尺左右裝一個，用電綫連接，所用的電燈雖不大於手電筒用的燈泡，但是光支很强。一個人必需費數小時的苦辛，始可把這一千多只小燈泡裝在它們的燈座上·總電纜用狹帶絞繫在拖繩上。從廣告通到飛機下方的電端，在未拉放以前，須用伏特計檢騐所接電綫的各部分，是否沒有</p>
<p>現在發光廣告完成，其次要講到拉放的方法。據拉放白天天　廣告的經騐，發光天空廣告亦可用相同的方法來拉放。標準的拉放法，係將廣告平放在飛行塲上，然後將拖繩向後，再向前引到飛機成一巨大U字形。當飛機出發時，它先拉起U的弛部，然後把廣告從地上「剝」去。爲保證發光廣告不得捐毀起見，它的創作人用一組人員把廣告扶直，以便飛機拉去，又爲保持發光廣　穩定和直立於空中起見，在廣告的三角形布製　　底下裝一流綫形重物，在廣告的適宜部分上綫着數塊布，並在尾上裝一空氣拖綱。飛機剛要着陸時，先把廣告解放，使從容地　沉到地上。</p>
<h3>名曲介紹</h3>
<p>— 克諦</p>
<p>這裏我介紹兩首普契尼（Puccini）底著名歌劇「蝴蝶</p>
<p>有一天（Un　bel　di　vedremo）</p>
<p>這首美麗的詠歎調（Aria），旋律深具媚力，充滿了愛情的希望與幻想，是女主角蝴蝶夫人在第二幕開始時所唱的。雖然她底丈夫——一位美國軍官名呌平柯頓（Pinkerton）的——離開她已三年了，但她始終盼望他回來，她跟着愛子和一個忠實的女僕（Suzuki）住在一間小屋子裏，俠然度着愉快的生活。女僕已開始懷疑她底丈夫是否真會回來的，蝴蝶夫人雖也竭力鎮定地靜候，但總有一腔憂慮和恐懼在內心裏激盪着。在這首動人的詠歎調裏，她幻想着一隻大船把她底丈夫從遼遠的美國載回來了，再同她們過着快樂幸福的日子。狄安娜寫著萍曾在「初戀」（First　Love）一　裏唱</p>
<p>鮮花二重唱　(DUET　of　the　Flowers)</p>
<p>這首女聲二重唱（女高音和女中音）也是在第二幕中所唱的，可憐的蝴蝶夫人終於看見她丈夫乘的船駛進港口了，她堅信她的丈夫將回到身邊，於是吩咐女僕用鮮花來裝飾房間，準備迎接，女僕把花園裏所有的鮮花都採下來了，她們一面佈置着房間，一面唱這首興奮活潑的二重唱。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 幫瘦鷗</p>
<p>「諸位，我有一件事想跟大家商量！」比任何人都高的老祝像一支竹竿似的站在人圈的中心，滿臉堆着怪不自然的笑，向各人說：「公路檢查所我已經去過兩次了，鎭上我也去過。空的車絕對沒有，能分搭我們這批人的便車暫時也還沒有；現在祗有一輛已經滿戲人貨的貿易委員會的車子，答應給我們帶走兩個人。這肅分散着走，我原是不想答應的。可是，怪我不好，當初從樹林帶了兩位朋友，就是胡太太跟她的女兒，而現在胡本本偏又病得這麼兇，萬不得已，我想請老張伴着她們先走，好讓她趕快進河池的縣立醫院。這件事……」</p>
<p>「沒有問題！沒有問題，」許多人立刻衆口一辭的喊起來。「有病人的應該先走！」</p>
<p>祝兆年現在是眞的笑了，但同時他也費了極大的勁，才不使自已的眼淚流下來。</p>
<p>於是他分開衆人，悄悄地走近躺着的蘭的頭邊去。</p>

Over the past two weeks, a total of nineteen meetings were held to hear administrative reports and discuss proposals. More than seven hundred oral and written inquiries were raised, and nearly five hundred proposals were passed. It successfully concluded at 6 p.m. on the 2nd. The presidium nominated Representative Lin Hu to deliver the closing remarks, and Councilor Zou Shuwen delivered a speech on behalf of all councilors.

The eighteenth session was held at 9:30 a.m., attended by 211 people. Chairman Jiang [blank space] passed 65 financial and economic proposals, one emergency motion, two temporary motions, six review opinions on administrative reports from various regions, and elected resident committee members.</p>
<p>The nineteenth session, which was also the last session of this conference, was held at 3:15 p.m. Chairman Lin Hu, with 215 councilors in attendance. After the meeting began, the results of the morning's election of resident committee members were announced, followed by the reading of Wang Zaoshi's written inquiry regarding the arrest of students and reporters. After reporting on the matters, discussions began, starting with the peace plan, which was passed without objection. Suddenly, Kong Geng stood up and said: "I heard that the CCP broadcasted a rejection of peace talks," implying that the door to peace was still closed. The chairman replied: "They close their door, we open ours." Following this, Wang Lizai made a temporary motion requesting that the councilors participating in the inspection team report on the inspection situation, which was passed by a majority. Wu Cangzhou, Zheng Kuiyi, and others then reported on the results of the seven inspection groups. Kong Geng made a temporary motion requesting the government to pay pre-war deposits to the people according to the current price index, which was passed and sent to the government for prompt consideration and handling. During the afternoon meeting, the councilors spoke enthusiastically and adjourned at 4:10 p.m., followed immediately by the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The National Political Council's resolution on the peace proposal was passed during the nineteenth session on the afternoon of the 2nd. This was one of the most important achievements of this conference. This resolution was based on the review opinions and its three methods drafted by the Special Review Committee on the evening of the 1st (see yesterday's report in this newspaper). After the chairman read the full text of the review opinions, it was passed without objection in less than half a minute. Applause lasted for about a minute in the hall. Although Kong Geng spoke, he did not affect the passage of the resolution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Fourth Session, Third Plenary of the National Political Council successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 2nd. The conference was convened at a time when the domestic situation was turbulent and the people of the country were eager for peace. The conference represented national public opinion and formulated a peace plan, which was the greatest achievement of this session. More than four hundred proposals were passed during the conference, with the most relating to finance and economy, which sufficiently reflected that stabilizing the people's livelihood was currently the most urgent task. However, all councilors believed that peace must be achieved before the economy could be stabilized and the people's livelihood could be improved. Therefore, their desire for peace was very urgent. More than twenty proposals were submitted calling for peace. After convening a plenary review meeting once and special review meetings twice, and drafting review opinions to be submitted to the conference, it finally won the enthusiastic support of the entire body and was passed. The conference was declared closed, but no separate closing ceremony was held. Only Lin Hu, representing the presidium, delivered closing remarks, and Zou Shuwen, representing all councilors, delivered a speech. Both emphasized that the central task of this conference was to seek peace in order to pursue construction in peace and to guarantee peace through construction.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Councilor Wang Zaoshi submitted a written inquiry to the conference on the morning of the 2nd, co-signed by Huang Yanpei, Han Fu'e, Yang Boping, and others. It stated that news reports indicated that students in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Tianjin had stopped marching and demonstrating. Was the government considering no longer continuing to arrest students and reporters? Would the arrested students and reporters be released immediately? Furthermore, the conditions for the government to resume peace talks were not very clear, and it was proposed to ask Director Zhang to explain. During the afternoon meeting, the inquiry was read out, and the chairman announced that the inquiry would be forwarded to Director Zhang.</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks by Lin Hu, Representative of the Conference Presidium; Speech by Zou Shuwen on Behalf of the Entire Body</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Fourth Session, Third Plenary of the National Political Council closed on the evening of the 2nd. The presidium nominated Representative Lin Hu to deliver closing remarks, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Today, the Fourth Session, Third Plenary of the conference has been successfully completed. The presidium instructed me to deliver a speech on its behalf. The mission of this council is to gather wisdom and unite the strength of the nation. During the War of Resistance, it was to assist the government in carrying out the war. After victory, and before the implementation of the constitution, it was to assist the government in national construction. Obstacles have arisen on the current road to national construction. If these obstacles are not removed, national construction cannot proceed. Therefore, resolving disputes and seeking peace is the most important task.</p>
<p>Only with peace can we stabilize the economy, improve the people's livelihood, develop education, and establish constitutional government. The central task of this conference was to seek peace. All colleagues submitted twenty proposals, and the conference spent an entire day convening a plenary review meeting, followed by two meetings of the special committee. The proposed plan has now been passed. This plan is truly the key to peace, and it is expected that all parties will have a positive response. In its third item, the conference has entrusted its responsibility to the presidium and the resident committee. The presidium and the resident committee will act in accordance with the spirit of this conference and strive diligently to fulfill the mission of the conference in order to achieve peace.</p>
<p>The proposals submitted by all colleagues at this conference totaled more than four hundred, fully reflecting the demands and intentions of the national populace. The resolutions made by the conference have weighed the priorities and requested the government to handle them separately. We are confident that they will all benefit the government's administration. If the government humbly considers them, adopts them separately, and implements them one by one, the presidium and the resident committee will also, in accordance with the authority of this council, do their utmost to supervise and review them at any time.</p>
<p>After the conference adjourns, all colleagues will return to their respective regions. It is hoped that they will uphold the spirit of the conference and strive to fulfill their responsibilities as colleagues of this council at all times and in all places. All measures of the central government that affect the local areas, whether for good or bad, or for benefit or harm, should be carefully noted. Regarding local malpractices and the suffering of the people, it is especially hoped that they will be carefully investigated, and that efforts will be made to resolve them in conjunction with local public opinion organs. If there is a need to convey information to the central government, please send detailed letters to the resident committee at any time for consideration and suggestions to the government.</p>
<p>This council was established in July of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938] and has been nearly nine years. Its past contributions to the country are evident to all. Now, although there are only six months left until the National Assembly convenes on December 25th, all of you bear the trust of society and have an eternal responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation. It is hoped that you will continue to work hard to bring our country to a strong and prosperous realm. I wish you all good health.</p>
<p>Following this, Councilor Zou Shuwen delivered a speech on behalf of the entire body, explaining that the council has been established for nearly a decade, and its main purpose has been to promote democracy and convene the National Assembly as soon as possible. Now that the National Assembly has been convened last year, and the constitution will be implemented at the end of the year, those who have achieved success should retire. The council, which represents public opinion, should transfer its responsibilities to the public opinion organs that will be established in the future. Zou continued to point out that due to the instability of politics, economy, education, etc., China's international status is declining and the people's lives are deteriorating. The plan for today should be to seek progress in stability. Economic, financial, and educational matters should be handled with caution. At this conference, he offered his humble opinions on the above issues, hoping that the authorities will adopt and implement them, and that the handling of the student movement issue should be especially cautious. The work of the War of Resistance was difficult, and the construction of peace is also not easy. It is hoped that the entire country will practice thrift and strive for construction in order to consolidate the foundation of peace. We should seek construction in peace and guarantee peace in construction. In the shortest possible time, we should promote the realization of peace. Zou concluded by saying: Those who seek benevolence will attain benevolence, those who seek peace will ultimately attain peace, and those who seek construction will ultimately attain construction. By relying on our own efforts and striving forward, the above goals will not be difficult to achieve, and the country and nation will not be difficult to achieve prosperity and happiness.</p>
<h3>The Case of Controlling Commercial Banks Passed According to Review Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The issue of controlling commercial banks sparked heated debate during the seventeenth session of the conference yesterday. At that time, it was quickly decided to hand it over to the Fourth Review Committee for further review. It was discussed again at the eighteenth session on the morning of the 2nd. First, convener Deng Feihuang explained, stating that the authorities had not completely ignored commercial banks in the past, but the degree of control had not achieved the expected purpose. The review committee believed that stricter controls should be implemented in the future. Subsequently, Yang Boping and others spoke, believing that the attitude towards controlling provincial banks in the conference should be consistent and that there should be no contradictions. Finally, a vote was taken and it was passed according to the review opinions and sent to the government for handling. The review opinions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Existing commercial banks and money shops should be strictly controlled to ensure that their funds are sufficient and their business is normal. The methods are as follows: (A) Strictly order the competent authorities in various places to conduct regular and irregular inspections of banking operations; (B) Encourage the people to secretly report illegal banking operations and strictly crack down on them; (C) Authorize local public opinion organs to accept secret reports and supervise the implementation of management orders by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>(2) Under the current economic conditions, commercial banks and money shops should strictly implement Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on Strengthening the Control of Financial Operations: "Depending on the distribution of banks and money shops in various places, designate areas to suspend the resumption of business and the establishment of branch institutions of commercial banks and money shops."</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the matters that national banks should pay attention to improve: (A) Strictly implement the specialization of national banks. National banks must not engage in illegal speculation and should limit their business scope; (B) The loan system of national banks should be improved to fulfill their responsibility of assisting production; (C) The acceptance system should be abolished immediately so that small and medium-sized industrial and commercial production enterprises can directly enjoy the right to low-interest loans.</p>
<p>(4) The scope of business of provincial banks should be limited to the respective provinces.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Should Allocate Funds to Assist Shanghai's Construction</h3>

<h3>During the Adjournment of the Fourth Session, Third Plenary, Resident Committee Members of the National Political Council Elected: Thirty-one in Total, Including Zheng Kuiyi, et al.</h3>

<h3>Requisitioning the Property of the Wealthy: Proposal by Wu Chunwu Passed by the National Political Council</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Among the financial and economic proposals passed by the National Political Council during the eighteenth session on the morning of the 2nd, the important ones included: (1) Chen Gengya's proposal requesting the government to requisition private large amounts of idle capital and foreign deposits to save the economic crisis. (2) Luo Wanzhuo's proposal to stabilize prices, balance the budget, and stop issuing banknotes to maintain the people's livelihood. (3) Wu Chunwu's proposal requesting the government to make the greatest determination and, based on the principle of those with money contributing money, requisition the property of the wealthy to save the current economic bankruptcy.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Responds to Inquiries from the National Political Council: Exchange Rate Not Considered for Adjustment; U.S. Loans Limited to Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] In its written response to Councilor Zou Shuwen's inquiry regarding foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance stated that the government has not yet considered adjusting the exchange rate, stating: "The government has always been very cautious about changing the exchange rate. However, due to the continued rise in domestic prices, the exchange rate is far from the natural level. In order to encourage exports and consider the interests of overseas Chinese remittances, it is necessary to make appropriate adjustments at appropriate times. Since the last exchange rate adjustment, export trade has shown obvious progress, and overseas Chinese remittances in February and March of this year have also increased by nearly double compared to the end of last year. We are currently paying attention to stabilizing prices and have not yet considered adjusting the exchange rate." Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance responded to Councilor Wu Jiantao's inquiry regarding stabilizing the currency as follows: "Stabilizing the currency is indeed a crucial task at present. Before the new year, the government, on the one hand, improved the tax system and increased normal revenue to meet the needs of national economic development; on the other hand, it strengthened financial controls and supervised the use of funds to assist production as much as possible. At the same time, in addition to taxes, it used public debt and material policies to absorb idle social capital. All these measures are aimed at balancing revenue and expenditure and contracting the currency. We are confident that these measures are correct and will spare no effort in promoting them. If domestic order is stable and production proceeds in an orderly manner, the value of the currency will naturally be stabilized."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] In its written response to the councilors' inquiries, the Ministry of Finance made the following report on the situation of foreign debt raised by our country in the past and the situation of currently borrowing foreign debt: "The professional time raised 870 million U.S. dollars and 58 million British pounds. This is the highest agreed amount, and the actual amount used should be calculated. According to this, the British gold foreign debt during the war was only £14,844,773, and the U.S. dollar was $786,343,580.85. The foreign debt borrowed after the war was $121.45 million and 60 million Canadian dollars. These debts are being used successively. The only debts currently used are $5,122,241.82 and 19,496,491.99 Canadian dollars (excluding the remaining materials of the U.S. military in the Pacific, because the price of these materials is uncertain and related to the liquidation of the Sino-U.S. wartime mutual lease agreement, the figures have not yet been determined.) The task currently underway, in terms of foreign debt, is a $500 million loan. According to the initial negotiations between China and the United States, both parties agreed to limit the use of this loan to economic construction. Internal international trade relations of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and the post-war recovery of the world economy, all require the use of loans for international loans, which is not a unique condition for loans to our country and does not seem to affect our national character. As for the determination of self-sufficiency, it may be difficult to achieve in the current situation, but we must have this ambition. If the whole country can abide by this purpose, the project can also be gradually achieved."</p>
<h3>A Strange Encounter for a Kaohsiung Fish Merchant: Dissecting a Fish and Finding a Human Corpse</h3>
<p>Possibly Officers and Soldiers from the Fubo Warship Who Met with Disaster</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch] A strange incident of a human corpse appearing in the belly of a fish recently occurred in this province. It happened that Lin Tianshuang, a fish merchant from Kaohsiung, purchased a large shark at the Zhuli fish market one day. When he took it back home and dissected it, he was shocked to find a corpse lying in the fish's belly. It looked like a Japanese person, about 30 or 40 years old, and his face was fairly recognizable. Half of a grass-yellow sleeve remained on his left forearm. For a time, it stirred up the surrounding residents, who rushed to watch. It was speculated that he was one of those who capsized in a boat and was swallowed by a shark, or it was guessed that he was one of the officers and soldiers who met with disaster on the Fubo warship. Because his identity could not be determined, he has been buried in the Zhuli Township Office cemetery.</p>
<h3>Xu Fulin to Go to Guangdong at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Will Go to Beijing After the Provincial Committee Appointment is Announced</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xu Fulin told reporters yesterday: He plans to go to Guangdong at the end of this month because the work of the Guangdong branch needs to be developed urgently. He plans to stay for about ten days before bringing his family back to Shanghai. Although he accepted the position of provincial committee member due to the persuasion of the party, he will go to Beijing after the government officially announces the appointment. The expulsion of party members was a last resort. However, expulsion is not permanent. Both sides have a history of more than ten years. As long as the other party can abolish the Reform Committee and not bear old grudges, they can still restore their party membership after legal procedures.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wu Xianzi, vice chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, has adopted a detached attitude towards internal disputes and has not decided whether to accept the position of provincial committee member. On the 30th of last month, the party's organizing committee specially sent Ji Yiqiao, Hong Shaozhi, and Li Shengce as representatives to persuade him. Wu expressed that he plans to return to Hong Kong in the short term and did not give a definitive answer to the provincial committee matter. Furthermore, Li Daming recently sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that he is as detached and neutral as Wu Xianzi regarding the party's internal disputes.</p>
<h3>Eighteen County Magistrates Examined by the Pacification Zone Assigned to Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang News] Li Xixun, Jiang Zhiyang, Li Shijun, Lu Yingzhi, Yuan Jiaji, Lu Daoxue, Zheng Senqi, Hu Zemin, Zhou Junzhen, Liang Zhibei, Wang Tianzhong, Sun Zhongjun, Ye Yanzhang, Pan Tianjue, Gu Jianping, Wang Lingmei, Wang Jingtao, and Shi Fucheng, the eighteen county magistrates who passed the examination of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee and were assigned to Jiangsu Province, reported to the province.

<h3>Earthquake in Dihua Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 2nd] At 5:05 a.m. on the 2nd, an earthquake occurred in Dihua. The roofs shook and the earthquake subsided after 38 seconds.</p>
<h3>Opening Up Sources of Revenue and Reducing Expenditure to Balance the Budget: The Economic Commission Studies Methods; Dredging Grain Sources to Stabilize Rice Prices in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Economic Commission, since its official establishment on May 26th, has held three meetings in the week ending on the 2nd of this month. Zhang Qun, the concurrently serving chairman, personally presided over each meeting. The main points of the scope of discussion and resolutions of the three meetings are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the items stipulated in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan for balancing the budget, the committee has appointed committee members to form five small groups to study in detail the plans for opening up sources of revenue and reducing expenditure. The classification of the five small groups is: (1) military expenses, (2) food, (3) finance, (4) state-owned enterprises and the sale of enemy and puppet property, and (5) reduction of general agency expenditures. Each small group will hold meetings with the competent authorities separately this week, submit reports, and integrate opinions in the meeting to determine concrete measures and implement them quickly.</p>
<p>(B) The government has made sufficient preparations for the supply of food. In addition to actively dredging domestic sources of food, a large amount of food can be obtained from relief supplies, and it has been decided to purchase a sufficient amount of food from foreign countries. A rationing system will be implemented first in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Fuzhou, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places, and gradually expanded, increasing the area of rationing and increasing the distribution of daily necessities. When food prices are stable, other prices will naturally be stabilized.</p>
<p>(C) While the government is vigorously practicing thrift and reducing expenditures, it also plans to promote a widespread thrift movement and promote a national goods movement to create a climate of thrift. The meeting appointed a full-time committee member to study concrete measures in conjunction with relevant agencies.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Chinese Police Collectively Resign</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 2nd] The "Deh Sun News" claims: More than one hundred Chinese police officers have collectively resigned to the police chief because of their meager treatment. Each police officer's monthly salary is only 120 yuan, of which 40 yuan must be deducted for food, so the net income is only 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Freight Train Between Pingjin Hits a Landmine and is Destroyed by Fire</h3>

<h3>Intensifying Reclamation in the Yellow River Flood Area</h3>
<p>[Our City Dispatch] Che Min, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), told reporters yesterday: The situation in the north is completely different from that in the south.

The relief problem in the Yellow River flood area is particularly serious. Reclamation work is currently being intensified, otherwise the entire flood area is in danger of becoming a desert.</p>

<h3>Renewed Calls for Investigation of Corruption by Re-examination Groups; Delegates at the Senate Meeting Resolve to Urge the Government to Expedite Action on Corruption Cases Discovered During Inspections</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Correspondent, 2nd] The issue of investigations was brought up again at the Senate meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd, with the sound of "tiger-beating" filling the hall. Several senators who participated in the inspection teams recounted their work in various regions last year, stating that while they may not have caught any "big tigers," those they did catch were not merely "flies." They asserted that they had done their utmost and were not "putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat." This matter was raised by Wang Lizai in a temporary motion. He pointed out that the investigation teams had departed in succession in July and August of last year, and to this day, not only is the public unable to understand the truth, but even Senate colleagues are still in the dark, which greatly defeats the purpose of the Assembly's resolution to organize the investigation teams. Moreover, the public has many improper speculations about the Senate. In order to dispel doubts and allow colleagues to understand the truth, it is proposed that senators who participated in the teams report to the Assembly on the investigation situation and the list of corrupt officials. After the motion was proposed, Wu Chunwu and others agreed that, to dispel public doubts, it was necessary to report the results of the investigation to the Assembly. Wu Cangzhou reported on the investigation process in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, pointing out that the investigation teams were not judicial bodies. If cases are brought up but not followed through, the responsibility cannot be entirely attributed to the investigation teams. Zheng Kuiyi reported on the investigation of the takeover work in Taiwan, saying that the team worked in Taiwan for forty days and caught at least three "tigers." They may have been limited in their capabilities, but they would not admit to not having tried their best. The staff was never subjected to any external pressure and would never change their original intentions due to external forces. Liang Shangdong reported on the work in Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, pointing out that the takeover personnel in Tianjin and other places "robbed" materials, giving the people a bad impression. At the same time, they completely destroyed the construction work done by the Japanese in North China, which is regrettable! The team did not handle many major cases due to time and manpower constraints, but they were not "putting up a sheep's head and selling dog meat." Zhao Gonglu reported on the work in Qingdao, Shandong, saying that when the team arrived, local officials immediately said that the investigation team would not achieve any results. However, the team had uncovered the "Four Great Kongs" in Shandong and Zhang Legu in Qingdao. All of the above cases involved local influential figures and have been submitted to the court, but have not yet been decided. The judicial authorities should bear the responsibility. Finally, Wu Wangji reported on the investigation in Shanghai, pointing out that Shanghai had the most enemy and puppet property, but unfortunately, there were many strange fires and a lot of materials rotted, which was a great pity! The team was not unprepared to beat tigers, but unfortunately, there was too little time. Wu also cited examples of major cases handled, hoping that the government could quickly and thoroughly sort out the past cases. After the report, the meeting resolved to urge the government to expedite the handling of investigation cases.</p>
<h3>The Eighteenth Meeting of the Senate Passes Resolutions on Finance, Economy, Food, and Other Matters; Swiftly Plans to Establish a Fair Burden-Sharing System for the People</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, 2nd] The policy reports from the government departments that were heard at this Senate meeting were all reviewed by various review committees, submitted to the Assembly for approval, and made into resolutions to be implemented by the government. At the eighteenth meeting on the morning of the 2nd, the final six resolutions were passed. The main points are as follows:</p>

On balancing the budget: (1) The fundamental way to balance the budget seems to be to start with ending military conflicts, stabilizing prices, and eliminating corruption; (2) The decision on taxation policies or laws must be made with extreme caution beforehand, and they must be strictly enforced after implementation; (3) The implementation of property tax is expected to uphold the spirit of the Three People's Principles and swiftly plan to establish a fair burden-sharing system for the people; (4) The issuance of public bonds should first restore credit and stabilize the currency value; (5) The sale of enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials</p>
<p>should not allow them to fall into the hands of bureaucratic capitalists or speculators.</p>

<h3>After the Opening of the Puyang-Yanzhou Section of the Jinpu Railway, Shandong Will Enter a New Phase; One of Our Correspondent's Reports on a Tour of Southern Shandong</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the opening ceremony of the Puyang-Yanzhou section of the Jinpu Railway, I, as a reporter, made a tour of the points and lines in southern Shandong. Everywhere I went, I deeply felt a sense of desolation across this vast land.</p>
<p>Along the railway line, only piles of broken walls and ruins remain at the stations, and the only modern buildings are工事堡壘 and defensive structures resembling the "Great Wall." The situation appeared desolate, and I deeply felt that the further north I went, the closer I got to the "front line."</p>
<p>Yanzhou, a major town in southern Shandong, has been a strategic location for military strategists since ancient times. Currently, due to the military advancements, Yanzhou has become the advanced command headquarters and the main supply base for the National Army's forward base.</p>
<p>Therefore, the opening of the Puyang-Yanzhou section is more for military purposes than for the convenience of travelers. In the future, the National Army in the battles in southern and central Shandong will have another major artery, which may lead to another new phase in the near future.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current military situation between the National and Communist forces, after the National Army recovered Jining, Qufu, Ningyang, Zou County, and other areas, Yanzhou and neighboring counties have gradually restored normal contact. The main force of the Communist army in this area is in danger of being annihilated at any time, so most of them have been split up and scattered into the mountainous areas, with only some scattered small groups harassing everywhere like bandits. In reality, they can no longer play a role. However, the future of southern Shandong will mainly depend on the active strengthening of the pacification work and the political work in various counties so that everything can get back on track. We should know that the people in a vast land are still in a state of hunger and poverty.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew from Nanjing to Yanzhou on the 20th of last month and stayed for more than three hours. He gave detailed instructions on the future war situation in southern Shandong. It is believed that when the Jinpu Railway reaches Jinan this winter, the situation in Shandong may turn from a gloomy atmosphere to a sunny situation.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces in Shandong Cross the River and Flee Westward; They Are Surrounded and Severely Attacked by the National Army</h3>

The Communist forces could not withstand the attack and fled back to the north bank of the Yellow River on the night of the 1st.</p>

<h3>Our Representative Will Depart for the United States in a Few Days to Attend the Final Meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</h3>

<h3>Under the Vigilance of the Security Authorities, All Areas Were Peaceful and Uneventful Yesterday; Arrested Individuals in Chongqing May Be Released on Bail One After Another</h3>

<h3>"June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Commemoration; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issued a Special Instruction; The Government Has Made a Decision to Eradicate Drugs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day will be held on the 3rd. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued the following special instruction:</p>
<p>This year's June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration is held before the Constitution has been promulgated, the constitutional government is about to be implemented, and after the successful conclusion of the United Nations Anti-Smoking Conference. This is of extraordinary significance. Since the government resolved to ban drugs in the 23rd year of the Republic, I, personally, have drafted a two-year drug prohibition and a six-year anti-smoking plan, supervising the implementation with all my efforts. Although there was a difficult eight-year war of resistance and the enemy and puppet's rampant毒化, the execution of my anti-smoking policy has never been abandoned. Resisting the war and banning drugs are both important measures to eliminate the obstacles to unification and lay the foundation for the constitutional government. The two cannot be neglected. We must completely eliminate the domestic烟毒 and eradicate the smoking and trafficking of烟毒 by overseas Chinese, so that the country has no unhealthy citizens and the international community has no room to指責 and誹議 us. Only then can the implementation of the constitutional government proceed smoothly. However, after the end of the war, the 毒化 of the enemy has yet to be eliminated, and the Communist army has intensified,破壤禁政. If my people do not make up their minds to strengthen themselves with all their strength, the success of my existing禁政 will be destroyed in one day, and its impact on international status and the　政 will be no less than that of foreign invasions and civil strife. I hope that my compatriots at home and abroad will continue to assist the government, publicize and advise, report and accuse, based on their glorious history of advocating anti-smoking for decades. The organs, auxiliary groups, and overseas领馆,僑領僑團, at all levels of the禁政 must strictly implement the promulgated laws and regulations, and go all out with one heart and one mind. With the spirit of annihilating the enemy and repaying the country, they should fight the last battle with the remaining烟毒. The people at home and abroad who have addicted to烟毒 and種售烟毒 are also encouraged to always consider their personal lives and the status of the country, quickly wash away their old habits, strive to reform themselves, and jointly complete the禁政. In short, the government has made a decision to eradicate the毒. After the start of the constitutional government, if there is still one person or one place in violation, it means that my duties today have not been fulfilled, and it is also a shame for my entire nation that has not been washed away. I hope that on the occasion of the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration, we will exhort each other and encourage each other, and strive to launch a more active and thorough anti-smoking campaign immediately after the closing of the Commemoration Conference. The day when the constitutional government is implemented will also be the day when禁政 succeeds. There is great hope for除萬佈新,強民建國.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Wang Depu, Chairman of the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior, gave a radio address on the eve of the "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Day, reviewing the禁政.</p>

<h3>The Choice of the Indian People: Partition or Unification?</h3>
<p>British Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, convened a round table conference yesterday with the leaders of various Indian political parties and announced the solution to the Indian problem proposed by the British government, which he had just brought from London. He allowed the Indian people to choose between unification and partition. Thus, the turbulent Indian political situation, which has been plagued for 150 years, has now reached a final decision point. Unification or partition? The answer will be known within a day or two. The British authorities have taken strict military precautions in case of emergencies. People all over the world are also expressing great concern about the future fate of India. According to general observations and predictions, the partition of India is inevitable; however, after this round table conference decides on the partition of India, a civil war in India will be unavoidable. It would be a great tragedy in post-war international politics if India were forced to embark on this tragic fate.</p>
<p>Under British rule, India has always sought independence and autonomy. On February 22nd of this year, British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain would withdraw from India on June 1, 1948, and completely transfer power to the Indian government. This important statement was not only warmly welcomed by the Indian people, but people in other countries also praised the wise measures taken by the British Labour Party government. Logically, the shared national aspirations of the Indian people could soon be fully realized, as long as everyone is willing to work together in harmony, is not affected by sectarian differences, and can work together wholeheartedly for a democratic, unified, and autonomous India. Then, by June 1st of next year, a bright and emerging India could appear before our eyes. However, looking at the situation in India, sectarian differences and complex circumstances have created many hidden reefs for the future of Indian unification. The most important of these reefs is the conflict between Hindus and Muslims. The Muslim League insists on the separation of "Pakistan" and "Hindustan" and has reached an irreconcilable point. In addition, the princely states within India still maintain the monarchical traditions since the Middle Ages. It is really not an easy task to overcome all difficulties and achieve national unification. Therefore, the bright prospects of India are still shrouded in haze, and the outlook for the future is not optimistic. The world cannot help but regret that India can achieve independence but not unification and will eventually be divided; especially we Chinese, who are in East Asia and neighbors with India.</p>
<p>Since the British government announced the return of power to the Indian people, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims in India has not only not been reduced or eased, but has intensified, causing unrest in various parts of India. Since taking office, Governor-General Mountbatten has also exhausted his wisdom to reconcile the views of the major political parties in India, hoping that they can work together in harmony and sacrifice their prejudices for the new India. However, the results of three months of efforts have not yielded any results. Therefore, he had to accommodate the views of the Muslim League and advocate allowing the Indian people to choose between the two options of unification and partition. On May 17th, Governor-General Mountbatten was summoned back to the country to report the views of the major Indian political parties to the government in detail and put forward his own proposals. The British Cabinet had no choice but to reluctantly agree. The main points are five: (1) Dissolve the existing Constituent Assembly in New Delhi; (2) Hindu and Muslim groups should each establish a Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution for the partition of India; (3) The two major provinces of Bengal and Punjab should also be divided internally; (4) A referendum should be held in the Northwest Frontier Province to decide whether to become autonomous or merge into Hindustan or Pakistan; (5) The powers of the current coalition interim government will be transferred to the comprehensive new interim government, which will be organized by representatives from each Constituent Assembly; (6) Britain should transfer power to the Hindu Constituent Assembly and the Muslim Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>When the British Cabinet discussed this plan, it also caused disagreements at one time. At the same time, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah put forward new demands and analyzed the meaning of Pakistan into six points: (1) The Muslim League requires Hindustan to provide a corridor to connect Northwest Pakistan and Northeast Pakistan; (2) The Muslim League will not give up an inch of land in its demand for the partition of Bengal and Punjab provinces; (3) A truly beneficial relationship can be established between Pakistan and Britain; (4) Pakistan and Hindustan should establish friendly and mutually beneficial relations; (5) The Pakistani government should be a representative government of the people; (6) Pakistan will apply to join the United Nations organization. Jinnah's demands were not only opposed by the Indian National Congress, but also could not be agreed to by the British Cabinet. Therefore, the British Cabinet discussed repeatedly and, in a state of helplessness, approved Governor-General Mountbatten's plan and had him take it back to India to allow the Indian people to choose freely.</p>
<p>Although the British have reached an agreement on a solution to the Indian problem and have agreed in principle to the Muslim League's demand for partition, the attitude of the National Congress, which firmly advocates Indian unification, is most worthy of our attention. Nehru, Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, refuted Jinnah's demands on the 24th, saying: "We only hope for the unity of India. We have no intention of forcing others, but we cannot tolerate being forced by others. If there are no other demands and a just solution can be obtained on this basis, we can proceed to promote the unity of India." The National Congress has also formally notified the British government that, under no circumstances, will it approve of dividing India into Pakistan and Hindustan. Mahatma Gandhi's attitude is even more intense: Gandhi made a very painful statement: "Britain must first kill me, Gandhi, before it can divide India." He also said, "If the Muslim League says: 'If you don't give me Pakistan, we will use the sword,' we should answer, 'We will never give you Pakistan. You can cut me or the country into pieces.'" Based on this, the round table conference that opened yesterday in New Delhi is bound to be disputed and may not be able to reach an agreement immediately.</p>
<p>In short, the Indian political situation is on the verge of civil war. If the Hindu and Muslim leaders cannot use political wisdom to eliminate sectarian discrimination and find a middle ground between unification and partition, then it is feared that India may embark on the path of self-destruction. It is hoped that the British Governor-General, who is in the position of mediator, will remain impartial and adopt a moderate and appropriate approach, and promote the harmonious cooperation between Hindus and Muslims so as to transform hostility into peace and enable India to truly be reborn.</p>

<h3>Seven Indian Leaders Convened for Meeting, Governor of India Proposes Partition Plan, Gandhi Received After Meeting for Long Talk</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: Mountbatten held a round table conference today for two hours with seven Indian leaders. The original plan for a unified Indian administration drafted by the British cabinet was rejected and unable to be discussed. At the time, Governor Mountbatten proposed an opposite suggestion, which included the partition of India and the assignment of an international committee to determine new boundaries, etc., and limited the Indian leaders to reply within 24 hours.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 1st Broadcast: New Delhi issued a public announcement today: It is said that the British plan to return power to the Indian people will be announced tomorrow, showing that the major Indian political parties have accepted the British suggestions. The public announcement further states that Mountbatten will broadcast tomorrow night and announce the contents of the British plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 2nd] An official public announcement said: The British-Indian round table conference convened this morning for two hours. During the session, Mountbatten made a detailed report of the meetings in India and Britain on how the British government adopted the current plan, and distributed a copy of the declaration to each leader. The meeting was extended to 10:00 AM tomorrow, giving each committee time to study. After the meeting, Jinnah and Mountbatten had a brief conversation. At 12:30 in the afternoon, the Governor had a talk with Gandhi again until 1:15. The Governor has scheduled to meet fourteen representatives of the Senate and various provinces at 4:00 PM tomorrow. At 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, the Governor will make a broadcast speech, and all Indian radio stations will broadcast the declaration of the British government. Subsequently, Nehru, Jinnah, Singh, and others will also speak. The Governor will hold a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The meeting between the Governor of India and the seven Indian leaders convened this morning for two hours and then extended. At 10:00 AM this morning, the Indian leaders who were to attend the meeting arrived at the venue to listen to the plan that the Governor of India had returned with from London. The first to arrive was the Chairman of the Muslim League, Jinnah, with a cigar in his mouth and a smile on his face. Next to arrive was the Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, Nehru, with a serious expression. Accompanying him were Interior Minister Patel and Chairman of the National Congress, Kripalani, and the Sikh leader, Singh. Finally, the last to arrive were the two other leaders of the Muslim League, Minister of Transportation of the Interim Government, Nishtar, and Minister of Finance, Ali Khan. When the representatives arrived at the Governor's Office, there were no large crowds gathered, nor were there any demonstrations. After the meeting, the Indian leaders left the Governor's Office with smiles on their faces. Jinnah left twenty minutes later than the other Indian leaders. When reporters asked, "Got it?" (meaning, were the demands of Pakistan fulfilled?), Jinnah did not answer.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The Governor of India, Mountbatten, will recommend to the Indian leaders at 10:00 AM this morning that dominion status be granted to Hindustan and Pakistan, that Bengal and Punjab be divided into districts, and that new elections be held in the Northwest Frontier Province to determine whether the province should belong to Pakistan. According to extremely reliable sources, the British government will ask the Indian leaders to accept dominion status under the Statute of Westminster. Britain will not interfere with or control Hindustan and Pakistan, but the latter must pledge allegiance to the British King. This plan will allow the Indian Army to continue to be governed by one staff department without division, and the phenomenon of the army being divided into two in June 1948 can be avoided. It is said that several National Congress leaders have already accepted this suggestion. If both the National Congress and the Muslim League accept dominion status, the Governor, who has the status of a representative of the British King, will automatically withdraw and be replaced by a Governor stationed in the dominion. The current Indian Interim Government will also disappear with it and be replaced by a dominion government. The Governor will be able to inform London by telegram at the latest tonight after learning of the Indian leaders' reaction to the plan this morning. On Tuesday afternoon, the Governor will meet with representatives of the various native states.</p>
<h3>Strict Precautions Throughout India, Governor Inspects Turbulent Areas on Eve of Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The entire territory of India, from Karachi in the west to Calcutta in the east, from Peshawar in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, is under strict precautions. Calcutta has been under military control since last night in seven of the city's twenty-four police districts. Since 2:00 AM this morning, military troops have been deployed in large numbers. Residents throughout the city are hoarding food for one week to more than ten days in anticipation of unrest.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Riots broke out again in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikh tribe in Punjab province, over the weekend. The military and police fired many shots. On Saturday night, fires broke out in many places in the city, and three churches were not spared.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 1st] Accompanied by Governor Jenkins of Punjab, the Governor of India, Mountbatten, flew to inspect the turbulent rural areas of Gurgaon. The details of Mountbatten's trip are unknown, but it can be seen that before he holds an important meeting with the Indian leaders tomorrow and submits a program plan to the conference, he wants to see the peaceful state of India.</p>
<h3>British Press Comments on Indian Issue</h3>
<p>Recognizing that the Future of Partition is Not Optimistic</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 2nd] "News Chronicle" commented today: The implementation of partition in India may be the only way to solve the Indian problem, but it is not a good policy, and we regret this. Regarding the round table conference of Indian leaders held in New Delhi, the world's attention will be focused on this. Governor Mountbatten is meeting with them and is using all his strength to promote coordination among Indian leaders. This is the key to determining the fate of India and an important moment for the world. The task of this conference is to deal with the future of one-fifth of the world's population, that is, 400 million people. At this moment, Indian leaders can no longer harbor the thought that Britain will use bayonets to force their powerful opponents to yield. As far as the current situation is concerned, partition seems inevitable, but few people who love India are optimistic about its future. For example, dividing the provinces of Bengal and Punjab is enough to make India's unstable economy even more tense. Millions of lives in India are now in danger. If the New Delhi Conference has to adopt a partition decision, then we deeply hope that it will be done peacefully and that economic realities should be taken into account.</p>

<h3>Military Training Advisory Committee Recommends that the United States Implement Compulsory Military Training; Truman to Submit to Congress Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] President Truman's Military Training Advisory Committee today submitted a recommendation that all male high school graduates or dropouts between the ages of 18 and 20 be required to undergo six months of compulsory basic training in the Army or Air Force.</p>
<p>In brief: This plan is a necessary factor for implementing the national security plan, especially in this age of atomic warfare. It is an important measure for training young people and strengthening national defense. It is estimated that the implementation of this plan will cost approximately two billion U.S. dollars annually. This report was drafted by the Committee after five months of research. It is expected that President Truman will submit it to Congress for discussion based on this proposal. According to the Committee's estimates, approximately 1.1 million people can receive this training each year. The report then predicted the alarming situation of future wars as follows: (1) Long-range aircraft can cross oceans to carry out attacks; (2) Weapons of mass destruction, such as atomic energy, germs, and chemicals, will be used; (3) Events similar to the Pearl Harbor sneak attack will occur frequently; (4) Every city, factory, and farmland will become a battlefield in modern warfare; (5) The activities of the Fifth Column will become more important than Hitler's Fifth Column.</p>
<h3>Soviet Government Endeavors to Cultivate Young Military Cadres</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] President Truman's Military Training Advisory Committee today released a report on the study of Soviet military strength as a reference for the United States to implement universal military training. It is said that the Soviet military strength is based on the Red Army's compulsory military service and military training in schools. All healthy adult males in the Soviet Union between the ages of 19 and 50 are obligated to serve in the military. The Soviet Union also encourages paramilitary organizations such as shooting clubs, sports groups, and youth groups. This year, a special organization called the "Association for the Prevention of Air Raids and Chemical Warfare" was established, with 16 million male and female members. Although officials claim that the association is a people's voluntary organization, it is in fact a government agency dedicated to providing various military trainings to the people. In order to cultivate long-term military officer talents, the Suvorov Military Academies are training children as young as ten years old to become professional officers. There are a total of 4,500 student slots. The course lasts for seven years, and graduates can be promoted to military universities. Graduates of universities become officers. Universal youth military service in the Soviet Union begins at the age of 19, and for high school graduates, it begins at the age of 18. Those who are suitable for combat are assigned to active duty troops for two to five years or immediately transferred to the "First-Line Reserve." Those who must support elderly and frail parents and those who exceed the annual conscription quota are directly transferred to the "Second-Line Reserve" after completing active duty. All reservists can be called up to active duty at any time and must periodically undergo training in training camps for one to three months. Women may also be conscripted, and the Minister of Military Affairs may assign women with medical, veterinary, and other special training to join the army and navy. These women may be called up to training camps during peacetime and may be conscripted to serve in auxiliary teams and special teams during wartime.</p>
<h3>Taft Argues for Ratification of Four-Nation Treaty</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Senator Taft, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, declared today that he supports Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in advocating the ratification of the four-nation treaty with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. Some opposition opinions have been carefully considered, with the opposition believing that the approval of the Italian treaty will lead to the withdrawal of American troops or create an opportunity for the Italian Communist Party to seize power. Taft also stated that he did not know what the situation would be after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, nor did he think anyone could speculate on it at this time. The Italian Communist Party may inevitably seize power. If so, what about our plan to aid Greece and Turkey to prevent communism? The issue is indeed significant. But I believe that weighing the pros and cons, it is best to ratify the treaty. This treaty may be the only one that the Soviet Union agrees to.</p>
<h3>Renowned German Aircraft Designer Messerschmitt Plans to Go to the United States; Rumored to Research Atomic-Powered Aircraft</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nuremberg, 1st] Germany's top aircraft designer, Messerschmitt, hopes to go to the United States in the near future to study atomic-powered aircraft. He said, "He received a plan from the U.S. side two months ago and is currently waiting for a more detailed plan. If the U.S. allows him to work independently, he will undoubtedly accept." He believes that it is entirely possible to use atomic energy contained in batteries to power aircraft. Germany has already studied this, and he is willing to help realize this theory. Messerschmitt is currently awaiting release from the Nazi court because he is accused of joining the Nazis in 1939 before he can go to the United States. Messerschmitt designed jet aircraft for the German Air Force.</p>

The Swedish representative, Mr. Setesku, is most likely to be elected chairman, as he has extensive legal experience and Sweden is known as a neutral country. The Dutch representative also has a chance of being elected chairman. After deciding on the various personnel selections, the Committee will first discuss the route issue, and then discuss whether to allow Jewish, Arab, and British observers to participate in the meetings. As for whether the Committee will visit European displaced persons camps, it will be decided after arriving in Palestine.</p>

<h3>The United States Will Soon Invite Relevant Countries to Discuss the Japanese Peace Treaty Issue to Convene the Japanese Peace Conference as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] According to well-informed officials today, the State Department is now speeding up the planning for the Japanese peace treaty. As a result of this progress, it is expected that the United States will soon propose to other countries involved in reparations to convene a peace conference. Secretary of State Marshall has not revealed which countries the United States will propose should participate in the actual drafting of the treaty. However, officials said that the United States' position is that when it makes a clear statement, it will not dedicate this task solely to the four powers, as was the case with the European treaties. Marshall and other officials acknowledge that Australia, the Philippines, and other countries, due to their contributions to the war against Japan, should have the right to participate in drafting the treaty. There are now indications that the United States will propose that most or all of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should participate in drafting the treaty. As for the date of convening the conference, the official said that the current goal is to do it as quickly as possible, as Marshall has decided to handle this matter as soon as possible. The assumption of Bernas, when he was Secretary of State, that the Japanese peace treaty should wait until the conclusion of the German and Austrian peace treaties, has now been completely abandoned. Although there have been repeated rumors that the United States is currently consulting with Britain or other countries on drafting plans for the Japanese treaty, no formal action has been taken so far. However, this action is expected to be implemented within the next month. Australian officials have demanded that the peace conference be convened as soon as possible and that Australia be given full participation rights, which has long been recognized here. Marshall declined to comment on Hoover's proposal that the United States sign a separate treaty with Japan if the United States cannot obtain the Soviet Union's consent. Well-informed officials said that the reason why the United States has adopted this attitude may be that the United States does not anticipate that there are any major differences between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding the Japanese treaty, as was the case with the European treaties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Hitoshi Ashida today hinted that the Katayama Cabinet, which was established only one day ago, has the ambition to conclude a peace treaty with the Allied nations as soon as possible. Ashida declared that he is planning to expand the current Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Central Liaison Office in order to prepare to convene a peace conference with the Allied nations as soon as possible. However, political observers believe that the Ministry's statement is hinting that the Katayama Cabinet hopes to meet with the Allied nations at the peace conference.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Provides Guarantees to Austria and Endeavors to Resolve the Issue of Austrian Prisoners of War; Soviet Newspaper Criticizes France for Violating Agreement on Repatriation of Nationals</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Vienna, 1st] An Austrian women's delegation, led by Prime Minister Jiffle, petitioned the Soviet occupation authorities today to repatriate Austrian prisoners of war held in the Soviet Union before this winter. According to Austrian officials, there are currently more than 100,000 Austrian prisoners of war being held in the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 1st] Soviet Deputy High Commissioner to Austria Seltov today provided assurances to a delegation of wives of Austrian prisoners of war that the Soviet authorities will continue to make efforts to resolve the issue of Austrian prisoners of war held in the Soviet Union. General Seltov expressed regret that some Austrian individuals are using the issue of prisoners of war to launch political movements.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Soviet commentator Korilov published an article in "Pravda" today, criticizing the French occupation authorities, especially the French occupation authorities in Austria, for violating the French-Soviet agreement on the repatriation of nationals signed on June 29, 1945. The article stated that the Soviet Union has repatriated French nationals in the Soviet Union or Soviet-occupied areas to their home country. The French Minister of Veterans Affairs and War Victims also told the National Assembly that there are no longer any French prisoners of war in the Soviet-controlled areas. On the other hand, some newspapers in the French occupation zone are urging Soviet nationals not to return to their home country but to move to France, Canada, the United States, or other countries. France's attitude violates the French-Soviet agreement on the repatriation of nationals.</p>

<h3>Youth Army Demobilization Anniversary: 20,000 Youth Grand Review; Leaders of Party, Government, and Military Agencies Deliver Speeches and Encourage, the General Assembly Passes the Organization of the United Founding of the Nation Grand Alliance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Today is the Youth Army Demobilization Memorial Day. Yesterday morning, all sectors of the Shanghai City demobilized youth, jointly held a celebration of the Youth Army Demobilization Anniversary at the Hongkou Zhongzheng Park. Participants, in addition to the city's schools and the industry's demobilized youth, there were also the Youth Army 202 Division, the Jiangsu-Shandong-Anhui Township Cadre Training Class, Hangzhou and Jiaxing two middle schools, vocational middle school students, and Shanghai Boy Scouts a total of more than 20,000 people.

<p>A scene during the Grand Review, the person standing on the front car, Commander Xuan on the left, Mayor Wu on the right. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Addresses from Various Leaders</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his address, in brief: We must first thank the patriotic youth who abandoned their pens to join the fight when the Japanese invaders were rampant and the motherland was in peril, for their spirit of sacrifice. Now, the country is in disarray and needs unification; the people suffer and need stability. All passionate youth should, with a spirit of national interest above all else, unify the country, stabilize society, and engage in nation-building.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan stated: We have been demobilized for a year, but the demobilization work is not yet complete. The Communist Party is rebelling with force, undermining unification, and the Democratic League is also inciting people everywhere, creating social unrest. But we must also humbly examine our own shortcomings and strive to correct them. Only those who are sound themselves are worthy of talking about revolution. I hope our youth will work hard to invigorate themselves and engage in the revolutionary work of nation-building.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan stated in his address: We must emphasize unified construction. Shanghai is an international city, so every move affects the whole country. We are willing to assist the government in organizing a group similar to the "House Un-American Activities Committee" in the United States to investigate and eliminate elements disloyal to the motherland.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Fang said briefly: The Communist Party and the Democratic League plan to instigate a "three strikes and one tragedy" movement today. Fortunately, thanks to the unity of our youth and the wise measures of Mayor Xuan and other leaders, their attempts have been suppressed. We need true democracy and true freedom, and we oppose "bandit democracy" and "bandit freedom." To oppose hunger, we must increase production; to oppose internal strife, we must suppress the rebellion to achieve peaceful unification and stable people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu said: The most righteous youth once recalled the leader's call for "100,000 youth and 100,000 soldiers," at which time the Communist Party opposed the division most vigorously. However, this kind of conspiracy was ultimately defeated by justice. Today, after victory, China needs stability, unity, and study. Therefore, we oppose rebellion, division, and strikes. The youth present should be the main force for stability, unity, and anti-strike.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Brigadier General Gu Rongjun, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the Youth Army's 202nd Division, accompanied the leaders from all walks of life and guests to inspect the ranks of the troops in military jeeps. The inspected youth were all full of energy and vitality, and the situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. After the meeting, they took trucks through North Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, and to Hardoon Road to disperse. Along the way, youth members dressed up to perform the crimes of the Communist Party. The conference also passed proposals such as a telegram to Chairman Chiang, a telegram to the National Political Council, a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the organization of the Shanghai Youth United Nation-Building Alliance.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The telegram to Chairman Chiang from the conference is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government, greetings. Since [the end of the war], two years have passed. We should have worked together, wholeheartedly, to elevate the nation to prosperity. However, the Communist bandits are rampant, engaging in secession and rebellion, selling out the motherland, harming our compatriots, and plunging the people into misery, causing our international standing to decline daily. Recently, in their desperation, they have incited student and worker unrest everywhere, creating social unrest. Thinking of this, I am extremely indignant. Therefore, we, the 50,000 patriotic youth of Shanghai, jointly declare righteous indignation, vowing to uphold the spirit of loyalty, courage, and patriotism, and under Your Excellency's wise leadership, to support the government's policy of unified nation-building and fully stabilize social order. We hope for clear instructions to guide the people towards a path of democracy. The nation will be fortunate, and all the people will be fortunate. The Shanghai Youth United Celebration of the Youth Army's Anniversary of Demobilization, respectfully submitted in winter."</p>
<p>[Another report] The presidium of the conference received reporters at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:00 PM, reporting the attitude of demobilized youth towards student unrest and the general situation, hoping for social stability and national unity. Therefore, the Shanghai Youth United Nation-Building Alliance was organized, welcoming youth and students from all walks of life to participate and work together.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Chases Suspicious Man, is Shot, Falls to the Ground, and Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>[Our report] Yang Hanxing, a patrol officer from the Wujin Road Police Station of the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau, went out on patrol alone in a "free military vehicle" at around 12:15 AM yesterday morning. When he reached No. 41 Wujin Road, a man suddenly appeared facing him near the wall, wearing a dark old suit, walking from west to east, looking flustered. He immediately ordered him to stop and raise his hands for a search. Unexpectedly, the man ran away and fired two shots at the same time. Fortunately, Officer Yang was alert and dodged, quickly returning two shots, but missed. The man fled in chaos towards Wusong Road, heading to Hayer Road and walking east. Coincidentally, security guards No. 11633, 11944, and 12646 were patrolling and saw the situation, realizing it was not a good person. No. 12646 fired a rifle but also missed. At that time, the man had already fled to the front of No. 45, when Officer Yang aimed at his lower body and fired two shots, one of which hit him in the buttocks, causing him to collapse. At that moment, the man, fearing punishment, shot himself in the forehead and fell to the ground, dying instantly. After death, his right hand was still tightly holding a revolver, a bullet belt was tied around his waist, and his left hand held a black leather holster. The dead man appeared to be about thirty years old and had no identification, so his name is unknown. The body has been sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Council Meeting Discusses Proposals, Elementary School Extending School Hours Problem Raises A Heated Debate, Passes Motion Asking The City Government to Instruct the Education Bureau to Deliberate and Handle</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Municipal Council held its fourth meeting yesterday afternoon. Discussing proposals related to education, public works, public utilities, land administration, police, etc. The fifth meeting will continue to discuss proposals this afternoon. The originally scheduled closing ceremony will be postponed for one or two days.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting hotly debated the "Elementary School Extending School Hours by One Hour" proposal among the education proposals. The rationale for the original proposal was: "Elementary school students usually finish school between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day. At this time, most parents have not yet returned home from work, and there is no one to supervise them, which is very dangerous. Moreover, during this summer time, when the sunshine is good, schools can keep them at school for self-study or other work, to avoid wasting time."</p>
<p>Being Stuck in an Attic is Worse Than Staying at School</p>
<p>Council members offered various opinions. The original review opinion was "Please ask the City Government to forward this matter to the Education Bureau for consideration and handling." However, Councilor Wu Zhengkuo expressed opposition to this proposal. He believed that most elementary schools are not equipped ideally, and that elementary school students staying longer in such a school environment would have a significant impact on their health. Lu Yinchu believed that most elementary school students' homes are very small, and staying in an attic after returning home would be worse than staying at school. Tong Daoyun suggested delaying the afternoon class time by one hour, and also delaying the dismissal time by one hour (changing the current class time from 1:00 to 3:00 PM to 2:00 to 4:00 PM). Some other council members agreed with this proposal, but some councilors indicated that the Education Bureau should be consulted and that the Education Bureau should decide.</p>
<p>Eating and Walking Quickly Hurts Children's Health</p>
<p>Pang Jingzhou and Zhang Zhongyuan also stated that children often eat too quickly or walk too quickly to catch the class, which is harmful to their health, and should be delayed. However, Fu Xiaofeng stated: This method is not very good, because after the hard rules are implemented, it will be almost dark at four or five o'clock in winter, and the light in the classroom will be too dark. It will also be inconvenient for children to walk on the road after school. Therefore, the Education Bureau should decide in winter. Wang Xianzheng expressed agreement with the meaning of Councilor Chuan, and said that elementary school students can have more time to rest earlier. At the same time, many teachers still have other work or private affairs after teaching, which will be greatly affected after the dismissal is delayed. Finally, after a vote, most people passed the original review opinion, "Please ask the City Government to instruct the Education Bureau to deliberate and handle."</p>
<p>Councilors Question Zhu Ping About Renting the Site of the Zhongzheng Camp</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to "transform the old site of the Zhongzheng Camp in Huacao Town into a secondary education area of ​​the city", the old site of the Zhongzheng Camp has more than 200 acres of land, which was rented by the Land Administration Bureau with a ten-year lease, causing councilors to question Director Zhu. Speaker Pan then stated: Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Organization Regulations, "The Functions of the Municipal Council", Clause 5 states "To resolve matters concerning the operation and disposal of municipal property." However, this was not mentioned in the Land Administration Bureau's report. Therefore, the city government is requested to report the land lease contract, area, rent, and leasing process at tomorrow's (ie, today's) meeting, and ask the council to discuss or ratify it. After the land issue is resolved, the proposal to transform it into a secondary education area of ​​the city will be discussed. The entire audience immediately agreed with this proposal.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Exporting Antiques, Send to the City Government for Reference</p>
<p>In addition, the education proposals passed by the conference include: (1) "New regulations should be announced and explained so that everyone knows them and can implement them," it was resolved to ask the City Government to transfer the matter to the police and civil affairs departments to be jointly responsible for handling. (2) "Please ask the Education Bureau to order schools to give priority to borrowing classrooms when workers' organizations establish labor literacy schools," it was decided that the Education Bureau should handle this matter. (3) "Please exempt education funds from being deposited in all levels of schools run by people's organizations or factories," it was resolved that this association should send a telegram to the Ministry of Education and a letter to the Education Bureau to facilitate the exemption. (4) "It is proposed that the Municipal Education Bureau handle scientific models and conduct activity education," it was resolved to send this proposal to the Education Bureau for reference. (5) "Please ask the Education Bureau to earnestly build the Municipal Jiangwan Middle School building," passed. (6) "Please ask the Education Bureau to increase the funding for the Shanghai Municipal Museum to enrich its content and strengthen the city's cultural education," passed. (7) "The City Government is requested to find ways to strictly prohibit the export of antiques, and to instruct the Municipal Museum to select and purchase important antiques for preservation and display," it was resolved to send this proposal to the City Government for reference. (8) "Please recover the Hongqiao Airport as soon as possible, and actively establish the Zhongzheng Cultural and Educational Zone, to revive the city's cultural development and show respect for the national leader," passed.</p>
<h3>The Council Budget Committee Reviews Health Expenses Again</h3>
<p>[Our report] Five councilors including Xu Yongzuo of the Municipal Council Budget Committee held a meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to review several budget items such as health expenses again. After review, regarding: (1) The temporary fee for clearing accumulated garbage of 453,200,000 yuan and the aerial survey fee of 530,000,000 yuan in the first additional budget are actually necessary or were ordered to be handled, and have already begun to be carried out, so they are tentatively allowed to be included. (2) 187,825,000 yuan for repairing the garbage truck and 148,692,500 yuan for building urinals in the third additional budget. The former can be paid from the bureau's original budget for temporary repairs, and the latter is allowed to be listed as is. (3) The report will be finalized before this afternoon's meeting.</p>
<p>The City Government Policy Report Review Committee also held a meeting yesterday morning to review the report, which will be submitted for discussion at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Faculty Association Requests the Council to Express Approval</h3>
<p>[Our report] The speaker of the Municipal Council reported two matters related to the student unrest at yesterday's council meeting: (1) Regarding the Jiaotong University Faculty Association's proposal that "the medical expenses of students injured in the May 30th conflict and the school's losses should be paid by the city government after investigation by the Municipal Council," the council should reply to express its agreement. (2) Councilors Zhao Yangxiong, Xi Yushu, and Yan Yilin were requested to attend this morning's Fudan University Faculty Board of Directors meeting. The conference unanimously approved the above two points.</p>
<p>[Another report] In order to understand the business situation of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, the Municipal Council has sent a letter to the bureau chief Lou Guowei to attend the meeting this afternoon to report.</p>
<h3>Petitioners Arise</h3>
<p>[Our report] Yesterday afternoon, trade associations in various industries in the city sent representatives to the Municipal Council to petition on matters related to the profit tax. Private radio stations also sent representatives to the meeting to petition for the abolition of unequal treatment with state-run radio stations. Education groups and private school colleagues went to the meeting again to petition for in-kind rations.</p>
<p>In addition, fresh meat merchants from the Central, Huxi, and Pudong districts of the city went to the Municipal Council yesterday to petition, stating that: In recent years, military police, including twenty troops, in the Central, Hongkou, Huxi, Pudong, and Nanshi districts of the city have repeatedly forced meat merchants in their respective districts to sell loss-making fresh meat, paying only 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan per catty, which is obviously unbearable exploitation. On the 30th of last month, after the representative of this association, Shi Zhigao, met with Deputy Adjutant Liu of the 33rd Regiment of the Military Police to conduct lobbying, they were allowed to pay a price of 3,000 yuan per catty from May 31, but it is still necessary to lose 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per catty. All colleagues are really unable to bear it, and they have come to the association to petition the higher-level authorities. Gu Ziyun, the person in charge of the association, separately submitted the grievances to the Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Their expectation is to request a reply and to allow the military police to be restrained from forcibly purchasing loss-making fresh meat, so as to stabilize people's livelihood and relieve merchants' troubles.</p>
<p>Another report: According to the person in charge of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, the price of fresh meat purchased by this regiment (2,000 yuan per catty) was agreed to by the representatives of the Nanshi District meat merchants in advance. Recently, the price of meat has risen sharply, and the industry representatives have not notified us. Moreover, the military police of the regiment have never forced purchases.</p>
<p>“To Equalize the Average Development on Both Banks of the Huangpu River”</p>
<p>"Requesting the Central Government to allocate US$20 million from the US$500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to build a cross-river project, so that the income from cross-river tolls and engineering benefits can be used to repay the principal and interest of the loan in equal installments," the resolution was passed as is. In addition to sending it to the City Government to transfer it to the Public Works Bureau for planning, it is proposed to ask the General Assembly to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan to approve the appropriation.</p>
<h3>Repair Old Zhabei Bridge, Open to Vehicles</h3>

<h3>Health Bureau Staff Accused of Corruption and Malfeasance, The Court Opens the Trial</h3>
<p>[Our report] The case of Health Bureau staff Zhu and Chen Boyu being accused of corruption and dereliction of duty by Liu Gulin and his wife Huang was heard in court yesterday. Liu Gulin was contracted to manufacture garbage trucks for the bureau. Due to rising prices, the delivery was slightly delayed, resulting in a balance of 22.1 million yuan, which he repeatedly requested the bureau to pay but could not obtain. Zhu and others used their positions to falsely claim that Liu's fines exceeded the amount he was claiming and that he needed to "smooth things over." On the 12th of last month, when Zhu and Chen accompanied Liu to the Shanghai City Bank on Jiujiang Road to collect the money, they jointly seized a package of 1.29 million yuan in cash that Liu had obtained. Liu refused to give it. During the dispute, Liu Huang called the police. Zhang Biao and other guards from the City Bank testified and escorted them to the Huangpu Sub-bureau, which forwarded them to the procuratorate for prosecution on charges of corruption. Zhu is in custody, Chen is on the run, and the case was heard by Judge Rao in the local court yesterday, who ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3>After the Index is Unfrozen, Different Parties Have Different Reactions, If the Capital Side Really Cannot Bear the Burden, They Can Negotiate Openly to Resolve It</h3>
<p>[Our report] After the announcement of the May employee living index, different parties have different reactions. Most manufacturers believe that they cannot bear the burden, and Yan Yaoqiu and others, the chairman of the Machinery Industry Association, went to the Social Bureau last Saturday to ask how to close the factory through legal procedures. On the employee side, most people are satisfied with the index, but they hope that prices will not rise again, otherwise life will still be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Li Jianhua, deputy director of the Social Bureau, told reporters yesterday that most people believe that the index announced this time is too large. In fact, the index is based on prices and is not fictitious. The problem now is whether the capital side can bear it. However, Article 5 of the Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures states: "If the capital side has poor production and business conditions and it is difficult to bear the wages as stipulated in Articles 3 to 5 of these Measures, the labor and capital sides may negotiate to reduce them. If the negotiation fails, it shall be evaluated by the Labor and Capital Arbitration Board." Therefore, if the capital side really cannot bear the burden, it can convene a factory meeting with employee representatives to openly discuss and resolve it. Otherwise, closing the factory rashly, resulting in a large number of workers losing their jobs, is not a solution. In addition, there is another way, which is to ask the government to help solve the difficulties, such as purchasing raw materials on their behalf, eliminating unnecessary donations and taxes, facilitating transportation, opening up sales channels, and providing legitimate industrial loans, to reduce a part of the capital side's burden.</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun expressed his feelings about the life index announced this month as follows: (1) What the government has decided today is a progressive calculation of 90%, which is a considerable concession for the labor side. Currently, the price index in Shanghai, according to unofficial statistics, is already around 40,000 times, and even if the workers' income is calculated according to the index, it is only the minimum living expense. If the factory side objects to this, it will inevitably cause labor unrest. (2) If a small number of factories cannot pay in full according to the index due to poor economic conditions, they should negotiate openly in the spirit of labor-capital coordination and mutual assistance to seek a solution. I believe that the workers' side will definitely not intentionally force the factory to collapse. If the capital side has real difficulties, the workers are willing to make concessions.</p>
<p>[Another report] Hu Boxiang and Tian Heqing, standing directors of the Industrial Association, went to Beijing together last Saturday, which is said to be related to the difficult situation of the factories after the life index was unfrozen.</p>
<h3>Promote Freedom of the Press and Effectively Protect It, A Letter to the City Government to Rebuild the Zhabei Baoshan Road City Housing Representatives Petition for the Return of the Occupied Civil Land</h3>

(2) Send a letter to the Public Utilities and Police Bureaus to quickly handle the opening of the Xinjiang Road Bridge and allow human-powered vehicles to pass through all day.</p>

<p>Consider Adding Water Pavilion Street Lights</p>

As for the proposal to "request the City Government to move back to the original site", it will be discussed together when the urban planning review report is discussed today.</p>
<p>Regarding the continuing discussion of proposals in the area of ​​public utilities: (1) "Lanes in the city lacking water pavilion (Taiping Dragon Head) street lights, please order the water and electricity company to add and repair them," it was resolved to send this proposal to the Public Utilities Bureau to order the water and electricity company to deliberate and handle.

The method is: "It is proposed that this association send a letter to the Municipal Government when compiling the municipal budget for the 37th year to include the funds for repairing the upper and lower water pipelines. According to Zhao Zukang, director of the Public Works Bureau, it is estimated that it will cost approximately 400 billion yuan to repair the city's upper and lower water pipelines. (2) "It is proposed to requisition Aili Park on West Nanjing Road to be converted into a public park." The resolution was passed, and the Jing'an District People's Representative Order was asked to authorize representatives to negotiate and handle. (3) "In order to connect traffic on both sides of the Huangpu River,</p>
<h3>Murder in Fuzhou Road, Qiu Lianhuan Dies from Serious Injuries, Chief Culprit Feng Renyi Flees</h3>
<p>[Our report] A bloody vendetta occurred in front of the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at 11:30 PM the night before. The victim, Qiu Lianhuan, was struck by four axes. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, he died of his injuries at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning. At the time, a man was shot and injured by Qiu.

Three days ago, Feng opened the Zhonghua New Hotel and secretly discussed the plan to kill Qiu. On the night before, Qiu was surrounded, and each of them took out sharp weapons and slashed wildly. Qiu's head was slashed, which was the fatal wound, and both his left and right wrists were gradually cut off, and his right leg was also seriously injured.

<h3>Dire Situation at Hao County Normal School: Students Without Food, Forced to Disband</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hao County] Hao County's County-run Simple Normal School suddenly stopped classes on May 27 and disbanded over 300 students in the first, second, and third grades on the 28th, leaving only over 100 fourth-grade students who will soon graduate. People throughout the county were surprised by this. This reporter interviewed Principal Su Pusheng of the school to learn the cause of the incident. Su replied that the school's student public grain has always been allocated by the provincial government under the item of public grain collected with land tax. The public grain allocated to the county last year, approximately 6,000 dan, was used for soldiers in the County Self-Defense Force, normal school students, and military prisoners. Unfortunately, all of it was plundered by the Communist army when they captured the city on February 1st of this year. The County Council resolved in March to allocate grain from this year's continued collection of last year's land tax. However, due to the severe spring famine, farmers are impoverished, and collection has been ongoing to no avail. In addition, the county treasury is severely depleted (the county's monthly budget needs 120 million, relying entirely on taxes, but currently only receives over 40 million per month, a huge difference, and many agencies are in arrears with salaries), so it is impossible to provide subsidies. As a result, the student public grain was stopped in May. Most of the school's students come from poor families and cannot afford to provide their own food. The school was forced to disband over 300 students in the first, second, and third grades, and only the more than 100 fourth-grade students who can afford to provide their own food will continue to attend classes until graduation in the summer.</p>

<p>The long-awaited battle between Zhenglun and Shanghai basketball champion Hualian team is scheduled to start at 6:45 PM this afternoon at the City Gymnasium. Before the game, there will be the second game of the final of the Mayor’s Cup youth group, Yuanjie vs. Sino-French. Tickets are 6,000 for upstairs, limited to 1,000 tickets, and 10,000 for downstairs, limited to 3,000 tickets. Presales will be from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, while supplies last, and will not be increased. The gate will open at 4:00 PM sharp. Military police will be present at the scene to maintain order, assisted by the Siwei Boy Scouts. Also, today's Yuxiu Cup makeup game and the Group B industrial and commercial group games are all postponed. The Yuxiu Cup game will be moved to Friday (June 6th) at the originally scheduled time. The program and referee list for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Yuanjie—Sino-French (Youth Final) 5:45 PM Jin Botao</p>
<p>Zhenglun—Hualian (Friendly) 6:45 PM Wu Zibin Yang Liecheng</p>
<p>Youth Group Final</p>
<p>The Mayor’s Cup Youth Group Final adopts a best-of-three system. In the first game, Yuanjie unfortunately lost despite initially being ahead. Today is their second encounter, a chance to avenge their defeat. As it concerns the championship, founder Qian Xucang must have a brilliant plan to defeat the enemy. Sino-French, having won the first game, will surely win the championship if they win today, so they will put in even more effort to achieve their goal. A bloody battle is anticipated.</p>
<p>Zhenglun’s Momentum</p>
<p>In the main battle, Zhenglun meets Hualian. This match has been delayed for a long time due to Zhenglun's tour, and can be said to have been eagerly awaited. Zhenglun has won six out of six games in Shanghai, shaking the Huangpu River. Their momentum is high, and their reputation is such that they can be compared to Qunsheng. Each of their generals is like a dragon or a tiger. Under the leadership of Captain Cai, Yu Ruizhang, Liu Zhengjun, Cheng Fei, and others are brave and good at fighting. Tu Wenlong is an especially dangerous figure, throwing the ball with one hand and hitting the basket with 100% accuracy, which is the key to scoring. The team's energy is abundant, and their spirit of fighting to the death is popular. Today, against the champions, they will surely display their superior skills and put on a wonderful performance.</p>
<p>Hualian's Prestige</p>
<p>Hualian has won the basketball championship for two consecutive years, dominating Shanghai. Recently, they toured Xiamen, winning all four games and shaking South China. They have just returned. In terms of momentum, they are no less than Zhenglun. Individually, captain Kong Guangyi, national player Li Zhenzhong, as well as Chen Xuechong, Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, and others are all veterans of the arena. Wu Chengzhang's performance in Xiamen was particularly good, and he is in excellent condition. He is young and strong, and is most qualified to deal with Zhenglun. Moreover, Zhang Liangxiong has returned, and Liu Fushan has also come to help, making the military strength abundant, unmatched by any other. The skill of their playing is secondary. Last year, they met Zhenglun, but because the players were ill and took to the court despite their illness, they suffered at the hands of their opponent. This time, the enemies meet on a narrow road, providing a chance for revenge. A fierce battle between dragons and tigers is expected. The rosters of the four teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Four Teams</p>

The Xingdao athletes, wearing yellow striped jerseys, were in high spirits. From beginning to end, they were impeccable, like eleven fierce tigers. Xingdao team center Zhang Jinhai opened the scoring. Before the end of the first half, left forward Zou Wenzhi scored another goal. In the second half, the Xingdao team still controlled the overall situation, and left winger Zhu Yongqiang scored two consecutive goals.</p>

<h3>City Center Sports Field to Begin Repairs This Month</h3>
<p>The City Center Sports Field was borrowed by the Quartermaster General Headquarters Ordinance Depot after the restoration. After much negotiation, it has been agreed to return it to the city for management. The authorities have now approved the transfer procedures and are preparing plans for the repair project, which is scheduled to begin in early this month and be completed in September. This will allow the 7th National Games to be held in Shanghai as scheduled. The estimated repair cost is 6 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Victory or Defeat of Hualian and Zhenglun; Strategic Application is the Key Tonight</h3>
<p>Tonight Zhenglun battles Hualian. Some predict that Hualian can win, while others believe that Hualian will suffer a crushing defeat. These two different views are based on different perspectives and are not contradictory.</p>
<p>Last year, Hualian was initially defeated by Qunsheng, and the players suffered from diarrhea on the day of the match. They took to the court while ill, and their morale was low, which was the main reason for their defeat by Zhenglun. This time, Zhenglun has returned with a vengeance, winning all six games. Their skills have improved rapidly, while Hualian's morale is high and their recent performance has been excellent, making revenge not impossible.</p>
<p>In terms of overall teamwork and individual skills, Zhenglun is not as skilled as Hualian. However, Zhenglun's stamina and speed, as well as the accuracy of their shooting from both near and far, are also formidable. This game is nothing more than a competition of intelligence and strength between the two teams. Therefore, proper strategic application will become an important key to victory.</p>
<p>However, I personally believe that Hualian has more conditions to win: their advantage in the paint will undoubtedly be taken by Hualian. Lao Bao and A Di are currently at their peak, and Da Li and Xue Chong still have their old style. Hualian's individual ball control skills are on average above Zhenglun's.</p>
<p>Strategically, Hualian should strive to seize the initiative. The lesson of the Mayor’s Cup defeat by Columbus is a good one. Hualian may wish to maintain their consistent style, focusing on stability and giving up competing with Zhenglun in speed. They should use more short passes, and when throwing the ball, they must take advantage of the follow-through to minimize the chance of the ball falling into the hands of the enemy as much as possible. Because of their lack of physical strength, Hualian should not adopt a man-to-man defensive strategy, but should pay special attention to Tu Wenlong and Yu Ruizhang. If necessary, Da Li and Lao Bao can be assigned to guard them separately, not allowing them to have the chance to shoot the ball. Hualian still has Xue Chong and A Di to score. Kong Guangyi may wish to play. Lao Kong is more suitable to deal with these inexperienced fierce generals than Xiangcheng. It is hoped that Lao Kong's long shots can offset Liu Zhengjun's scoring, but it is still not advisable to try long shots unless the situation requires it.</p>
<p>In addition, Hualian should also try to induce personal fouls from Zhenglun. If one of Tu, Yu, and Cai is fouled out, the situation can be decided. If Tu Wenlong "graduates" before the last ten minutes, Zhenglun will be unable to compete with Hualian.</p>
<p>Unless Tu, Cai, and Yu have smooth shooting hands, Liu Zhengjun hits nine out of ten long shots, or Hualian's strength fails midway - especially Da Li, I believe that Zhenglun will hardly be lucky in tonight's battle. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Plunges Across the Board; Illegal Trading Emerges Again</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The Shanghai stock market replacement of cash with US dollar bonds was officially announced by the exchange yesterday. The multi-party groups like Nos. 152 and 211 painfully cut their losses, and Yongsha fell to the limit, with the dark market calling low to below 6,100 yuan. Nine out of ten stocks fell to the limit. The general public felt regretful about the exchange's announcement in two stages that cash delivery was only allowed for one month's extension and the US dollar bond substitute measure. Most of the trading was transferred to the illegal markets. The trading price of Yongsha in the black market was more than 100 yuan higher than in the exchange yesterday. It was heard from insiders that short sellers with a background bought 700,000 to 800,000 in the illegal market, while many multi-party groups also settled in the exchange and resided in the illegal market, so illegal trading became prosperous.</p>
<p>The market felt fearful from the morning opening. Although the immediate delivery stocks were relatively stable, they plummeted as soon as deferred delivery stocks opened. After deferred Yongsha opened, Nos. 231 and 1217 made up for losses, slightly rebounding. Nos. 76, 163, 119, 27, 102, 207, and 36 sold off, dropping to 6,820 yuan. Nos. 235, 155, and 14 absorbed slightly and rebounded a little. Nos. 117, 94, 12105, and 157 maintained at a low price, but the increase was not much. Matches first fell to the limit. Nos. 185, 153, 224, 104, and 152 sold off, and deferred Yongsha subsequently fell to the limit. China Silk, Lilian, Yonggong, and Huafeng successively fell to the limit. The dark market called low to below 6,480 yuan. Nos. 99, 160, and 141 came in to buy, and Nos. 61 and 99 bought spot Yongsha, once rising to around 6,650 yuan. However, under the strong selling of Nos. 102, 76, and 152, it finally fell to the limit again. Spot Yongsha, China-France, Tongyi, Xinyi, Jingfu, Qinxing, Xinhua, Xinguang, Jinglun, and China Textile successively fell to the limit. Nos. 211, 152, and 102 jointly sold off strongly, and the situation worsened. There was no trading, only supply and no demand. Near the close, deferred Yongsha fell to 6,150 yuan. After closing, Nos. 129 and 32 sold again, and it fell to below 6,100 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery stocks, except for National Goods which remained flat and New Asia which slightly declined, Cement and Commercial fell by more than 10%. Xinhua, Yonggong, Rongfeng, and Lilian had some rebound after falling to the limit, each falling by 10% to 20%, while the rest fell to the limit. Deferred delivery stocks also fell to the limit. The illegal market stocks each declined from slightly to down over half a percent.</p>
<p>Government bonds were weak yesterday due to the unfavorable environment and tight money supply. Unified C opened at 14,800 yuan and gradually fell to 113,400 yuan, with Rundet and retail investors selling. In the end, short positions were covered, and it hovered at 14,000 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Grades A, B, C, and D each fell by 1,000 yuan, and Grade E also fell by 900 yuan, with a turnover of about 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Overseas stocks were sluggish yesterday due to poor sentiment and holders being eager to settle. In addition, Hong Kong's Shenzhen Electric also rose to 14 yuan, and Yisha had lost stocks found on the market. The market was very sluggish. The opening of Yisha fell to 69,000 yuan, with a high price of 70,000 yuan and a final price of 68,500 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British Union, Yisha, Steel, and Beer fell by 10%, and the rest fell by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Brokers' Three Hopes; Stock Exchange Decides to Submit to the Ministry for Approval; Opening Hours to Be Modified</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The Stock Exchange Brokers Association held an extraordinary board meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the new instructions from the Ministries of Finance and Economics regarding the payment of US dollar bonds as margin. As a result of the discussion, it was agreed that the new measures of the authorities should be sincerely supported. However, it was also proposed to ask the authorities to take into account the actual difficulties of the brokers and find ways to alleviate them. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will approve three requests: (1) The broker's identity guarantee deposit of 30 million yuan will be fully paid in US dollar bonds in accordance with the order. However, due to the limited time, it is requested that the payment deadline also be extended to June 15. (2) The substitute for the deferred delivery transaction evidence deposit, in addition to the provision of payment with US dollar bonds, it is still hoped that it will also be able to use 26 listed stocks or cash for deduction. (3) The US dollar bonds paid can be used for the full face value. The above three requests were sent by the Brokers Association to the Stock Exchange authorities yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Exchange held an extraordinary board meeting at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the three points requested by the Brokers Association. Chairman Du Yong, Standing Directors Xu Weiming, Zhuang Shuhao, Zheng Xiaozhou, and Wang Zhixin, Secretary of the Board of Directors Chen Xusun, Stock Exchange Assistant Yang Yinpu, Gu Shanchang, and Chief Secretary Hua Wenyu attended. The meeting adjourned at 7:15 PM. The main points of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>First, Stock Exchange Assistant Yang Yinpu reported on representing the Stock Exchange in explaining the current situation of the Stock Exchange at the City Council. Then, the discussion of various proposals began. The main resolutions were: (1) The housing contract with the former Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange has been signed and established. (2) The opening time of the Stock Exchange will be changed to 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM noon, which will be implemented after the announcement. (3) The three points requested in the letter from the Brokers Association were considered to be based on facts and will be submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Economics for approval.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Purchase Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>The national cotton production area purchase has now been ordered to stop. All yarn factories and cotton firms in this city that had established branches in various production areas in the past are now closing. Very few goods have arrived in recent days, and the transaction volume of the industry is very small. The market is calm. After the war, due to the inability of transportation to be smooth, yarn factories and flower firms did not dare to inquire about cotton producing areas far from transportation lines. Some cities within the areas of Hankou, Shashi, and Xi'an and near the railway lines have been the focus of yarn factories and cotton firms' purchases, and their current inventory has been exhausted. For those farther away from the railway lines, the freight is very high and the time is slow, so yarn factories and flower firms cannot purchase. In northern Jiangsu, except for Nantong, where branches were established for purchase, most other places could not be purchased either.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 1,512 pieces, all sold to manufacturers, with a total of 970 purchase orders, it is said.</p>
<h3>Leather Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Leather prices rose sharply as the black market exchange rate for gold notes and foreign exchange soared. Yesterday, the market called prices, with all goods rising by more than 20%. Transactions were very active.</p>
<h3>National Bank Studies Countermeasures to Strengthen Cloth Exports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank discussed how to strengthen the export of cotton cloth. The discussion was held at around 5 PM yesterday. The Bank's Deputy Governor Liu convened representatives from the Export Promotion Committee, China Textile Construction Corporation, and the Textile Control Committee to talk and study appropriate countermeasures. It is heard that the government's export of yarn and cloth has been entrusted to China Textile Construction Corporation as an agent. Recently, after the company exported cotton cloth and settled foreign exchange with the National Bank, the discount was quite large. Furthermore, due to the recent sluggish market price of yarn and cloth in Southeast Asia, the resulting export revenue was less than one-third of the company's list price. If the company is still responsible for the losses, it will be difficult to maintain the agency export business. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that representatives from the National Bank, Export Committee, China Textile Construction Corporation, and the Textile Control Committee would go to Beijing to discuss with the Ministry of Economic Affairs the issue of who should bear the losses, in order to strengthen the export of yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Another report: It is reported that since China Textile Construction Corporation started exporting yarn and cloth last year, the value of goods exported has exceeded five million US dollars. The export destinations include Hong Kong, Siam, Rangoon, Singapore, the Philippines, Java, Iran, Egypt, and Greece. Among them, most of the exports went to Hong Kong and Siam.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit and Sagging Yarn and Cloth Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly experienced tight credit, customer support stalled, and many took profits. In addition, China Textile Construction Corporation opened yarn sales with ample inventory, and prices tended to weaken. The price of 411-count Fengjian Phoenix yarn was 13.45 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from Saturday, while 110-count Shuangma yarn was 7.8 million yuan, down 250,000 yuan. However, the coarse yarn market was more stable due to the limited supply. The price of yarn sold by China Textile Construction Corporation was similar to the previous period. Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was sluggish due to stagnant customer demand and some selling off. Credit was tight in the market, and resale was not weak. The final price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 323,000 yuan, and Caiqiu cloth was 295,000 yuan, down 14,000 to 15,000 yuan from Saturday. Other fine cloths, such as Wufu, Lanj, and No Brand, all fell by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The market for bleached cloth, fine twill, and pique was also weakening, while colored cloth, raw cloth, blue cloth, floral cloth, Fufu cloth, and low-grade Shilin cloth were relatively strong.</p>
<h3>Producer Prices Rebound; Rice Prices Slightly Rise; People's Food Allocation Committee to be Established Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the rice market turned slightly from weakness due to it being Monday and stores being more active. The market revived. In addition, producer prices rebounded, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell easily, so the market improved slightly. The total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 8,351 shi, 7 dou, and 1 sheng. The price of high-quality white粳 rice was 420,000 yuan, and the price of thin rice was 415,000 to 420,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of rice by our government from Thailand and Burma, the Central Trust Bureau released the following news: Yesterday, 623 tons of rice shipped by Hualun Company Huimin from Siam arrived. Today, 1,500 tons of rice shipped by Yuanyang Company Yuanyang from Siam arrived. The day after tomorrow, 2,500 tons of rice shipped by Doulang Foreign Firm Bintang (Rintong) from Burma will arrive. On the 16th, Zhaoshang Haichen will also ship 7,000 tons from Siam. Yesterday, the price of flour varied slightly. The price of domestic flour and imported flour was stable. The price of Tongfen flour increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan due to demand from sauce gardens. The new wheat bran had just entered the market and was still sluggish, with a slight drop of 300 to 500 yuan. It was reported that a large batch of soybean cakes from Yingkou was shipped south, causing a sudden softening of prices. The closing price plummeted, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were stable, tea bean transactions were extremely rare, high-quality goods were stable, and medium and low-quality goods were reduced by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The supply of red beans was abundant, but sales were slow, and the market was flat. High-quality sesame seeds from foreign firms continued to move, remaining strong, while the demand from medium and low-quality oil mills was normal, remaining mediocre. Raw peanuts were actively sold, with a price increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was temporarily stable, while corn from Qingdao and the Beiyang region moved actively, with a sharp increase of 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas were similar, new broad beans had flat sales, and the market showed weakness. New Yuan wheat was first seen yesterday. The oil market saw a continuous supply of goods from Qingdao, and store demand was flat. Raw oil fell by 10,000 yuan, soybean oil was unchanged, refined oil was stable, sesame oil was slightly stronger, and new rapeseed, new broad beans, new barley, and new Yuan wheat have all gradually appeared. The People's Food Allocation Committee was scheduled to be established yesterday, but according to Section Chief Shi of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, the preparations for the People's Food Allocation Committee were mostly ready. Because Chairman Wu took advantage of this trip to Beijing to attend the price conference and contacted the Ministry of Food and other relevant agencies about all matters related to the committee, he remained in Beijing to carry out this matter, so he was unable to return to Shanghai as scheduled yesterday. The return was postponed until this morning, and the allocation committee had to be postponed to this afternoon for its formal establishment at the Shandong Shanghai Fellow Association.</p>
<h3>China Textile Construction Corporation Changes Yarn Allocation Method; Yarn Numbers and Weaving Industry Suspended from June</h3>
<p>China Textile Construction Corporation has slightly changed the allocation of cotton yarn to various manufacturers starting in June. Because the Textile Control Committee stopped purchasing civilian factory support yarn in April, the yarn source has decreased. Starting in June, the company will temporarily suspend the purchase of cotton yarn for yarn numbers, dyeing and weaving industries, and mercerized groups. In addition, the purchase of yarn for the knitting industry, glove groups, and hand-weaving groups will be changed to unified quota purchase by the Public Management Association starting in June, for fair distribution. Cotton textile industry associations that have registered in other areas will be limited to purchasing yarn once a month, with the third Wednesday of the month as the allocation date. Electrical engineering weaving belts, camel hair, and woolen weaving will all be purchased by the Public Management Association, and the original registered distributors will be suspended.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry and Longevity Group Loans for Wheat Collection Agencies</h3>
<p>The Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District requested a wheat collection loan of 320 billion yuan from the Food Department and the Four Joint General Offices. Factories in this city accounted for 240 billion yuan, but it has not yet been approved. It is now known that the Food Department has specific measures for lending to the industry. For factories in Shanghai, it is stipulated that the factories that collect wheat with loans must jointly organize a committee. All loan and wheat purchase matters shall be handled uniformly by the committee, and then the purchased wheat shall be distributed according to the production volume of each factory and the proportion of flour mills. The loan will be organized and handled by China Agricultural Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank. For factories in other areas, the China Agricultural Bank will be responsible for investigation, review, and lending.</p>
<p>The Food Department has notified the flour factories in this city of this method. The industry held a meeting yesterday and decided to first set up a loan-receiving wheat collection agency. According to the organizational regulations, each factory applying for a loan in this city will send one representative to serve as a member of course. There will be five standing members and one chairman. An office will be set up under the committee, and one director and one deputy director will be appointed to handle daily affairs. The director will be divided into four departments: loan, wheat, general affairs, and storage and transportation. It is heard that the committee will be established within one or two days.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten as the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar increased. The association's quotation for spot Peruvian sugar was initially 530,500 yuan, and later 542,000 yuan. The premium for warehouse receipts in the morning was 94,000 to 100,560 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 100,700 yuan, loosening to 95,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts for four-and-a-half carloads of white sugar were 140,000 to 145,000 yuan. The spot price for three-and-a-half carloads of white sugar was initially 515,000 yuan, and later 530,000 to 535,000 yuan. The spot price for 24 coarse white sugar was 580,000 yuan, and the spot price for 20 medium sand white sugar was 485,000 to 495,000 yuan, with a warehouse receipt premium of 130,000 yuan. The opening price for Xinghua white sugar was 470,000 to 650,000 yuan, followed by 453,000 yuan, and red sugar was 365,000 yuan, totaling several hundred baskets. More than two hundred bags of Diaoqing were priced at 300,000 to 300,500 yuan, dozens of baskets of Wenqing were priced at 283,000 yuan, Tiqing was priced at 334,000 yuan, and Shundeqing was priced at 312,000 yuan, with only dozens of transactions.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Cigarette Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with vendors adding to their holdings, and prices rose slightly. However, hoarders released their goods, and vendors from other areas resold them, causing prices to gradually fall. The market atmosphere softened further in the afternoon, and rumors spread that Yongtaihe was distributing British American Tobacco (BAT) cigarettes, leading to sluggish sales. The final price of 10 BAT cigarettes fell to 6.95 million yuan, and Laodao cigarettes fell to 5.9 million yuan. Other Chinese-made cigarettes were said to have rebounded. As for Shantou cigarettes, prices remained stable due to the lack of mold.</p>
<h3>Another Silver Shop Closes</h3>
<p>Qiu Tianbao Renji Silver Shop in Xiaodongmen also announced its closure after Fang Tianbao. The issue of severance pay for employees is also being negotiated, and a special agreement will be reached before closing the business.</p>
<p>Fang Tianmai Silver Shop on Nanjing Road began auctioning off its remaining inventory yesterday, and will close shop once everything is sold. However, the dispute over employee severance pay is still under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Huge Losses in Old Tea Sales; National Bank Agrees to Remedy</h3>
<p>Shou Jingwei, general manager of the China Tea Industry Joint Company, went to Beijing to discuss the overseas sales of old tea and the tea loan for this year with the Four Joint General Offices, and returned to Shanghai yesterday from Nanjing. According to reports, the evaluation of last year's 70,000 catties of old tea is expected to be completed in early next week. The evaluation standards will be based on New York, London, and French North Africa. The sales method will be the responsibility of Xiehe Foreign Firm, Wang Yutai, Huacha, China Tea Industry Joint Company, and other companies, which will sell to their respective foreign affiliates. The exchange settlement method, calculated at 12,000 yuan, will result in huge losses for tea merchants, and the National Bank authorities have agreed to find a way to remedy the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate. As for the tea loan portion for this year, China Agricultural Bank has lent 2.1 billion yuan. The amount is small, and the procedures need to be simplified. The original loan was set at three levels: 400,000 yuan for Pingshui tea, 500,000 yuan for Tunxi tea, and 600,000 yuan for Qimen tea. Tea merchants requested that the level be raised to 800,000, 900,000, and 1 million yuan. The authorities agreed to lend at three levels: 700,000, 800,000, and 900,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: The domestic sales of Tunxi tea usually open around the beginning of summer, at 500,000 yuan per dan, falling to 450,000 yuan. Now that the domestic tea collection season has arrived, most of the tea is in the hands of hoarders. According to the Tea Industry Association's registration, there are more than one hundred processing tea merchants. However, due to the strict restrictions on the China Agricultural Bank loan, and there are few outlets for old tea in Shanghai, tea merchants are generally hesitant. According to the original plan of China Agricultural Bank, it is necessary to collect 300 dan of raw tea before applying for a loan. Recently, after repeated requests from tea merchants, the standard has been lowered to 100 dan, and preparations have begun more actively. It is heard that more than forty companies have started collecting raw tea, with prices around 300,000 yuan or more.</p>
<h3>Hankou Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Due to lack of external sales for sufficient quantity white oil from Shanghai, the wholesale market saw a slight increase in prices yesterday. The wholesale price was 620,000 yuan per market unit, with few transactions, but retail sales were very strong. Hankou Guangbang's purchases became more intense, and the closing telegram was 515,000 yuan, with many transactions. The market situation was very strong, and prices are expected to rise further. It is heard that the black market price in Hong Kong can be sold for 1.15 million yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Longan Has a Slight Turnaround</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous road longan was weak and uninspired due to flat sales, but producer prices remained strong due to scarcity of goods. Recently, news from Quanzhou indicates that the cost exceeds the Shanghai market by more than 200,000 yuan, so it is not easy to loosen. Yesterday, the market opened with more than two hundred pieces, but the quality of the goods was inferior. The price was 1.05 million yuan, and high-quality goods were still 1.15 million yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>
<h3>Joint Request for Relief from Cloth Factories in Five Counties of Su, Chang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Cloth factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Jiangyin, and Changshu have repeatedly requested yarn allocation without success, and the cost of living index for workers has skyrocketed, causing them to feel deeply distressed. A joint conference of cloth factories in the five counties was convened in Shanghai a few days ago. Representatives from the counties, including Wu Zhenshan and Wang Derun, and other fourteen people, attended. After discussion, it was decided that (1) regarding the application for yarn allocation, starting today, in addition to issuing a declaration, they will also petition China Textile Construction Corporation, the Textile Control Committee, and other organizations. At the same time, they will jointly appeal to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant agencies, together with labor and management in the five counties. (2) The cost of living index for workers has soared, and inland cloth factories cannot afford it. However, the level of living in the inland areas is different from that in Shanghai, so each county should negotiate with the local labor representatives and the local competent authorities to discuss practical measures, with the principle of being approximately equal to 50% of the Shanghai market index. (3) Submit urgent appeals to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Four Joint General Offices, with the principle of approving the use of factory-produced machinery as collateral.</p>
<h3>More Selling Than Buying of Rayon; Market Prices Plunge; Factory Agents' Bids Slightly Firmer, Few Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of rayon in the market remained the same as the original plate on Saturday. The highest bid for 120-count Gaoshan with light was 20.7 million yuan. Later, due to more selling than buying, prices fell steadily. The closing price was 20 million yuan. The afternoon market was affected by the stock market decline, and people were more nervous. There were no actual sales, resulting in a continuous plunge. In the afternoon, prices fell below the 20 million yuan mark. The final bid was 19.3 million yuan, a sharp drop of 1.2 million yuan from Saturday. Dongyang Jin Sanma and other brands also declined accordingly, and the price of 75-count semi-light was also reduced by 1.1 million yuan. Yesterday, the market transaction for factory agents was very quiet. However, the bid price was slightly firmer than on Saturday. The C-grade bid was around 28 million yuan, and the D-grade was bargained at 27 million yuan, but no transaction was made. There were few transactions for high-grade five-dan goods, and there were slight transactions for mid-grade another dan. The transaction price for mid-range goods was 24.5 million to 25 million yuan, and the price for high-grade another dan was 25.5 million to 26 million yuan, all with three to four day forward dates. The medium-grade second-tier bid was 23.5 million yuan, and the dry-grade another dan bid was 18.5 million yuan, but few transactions were made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market was stable with a soft tone. Dachung quilt covers were traded at 9.55 million yuan, and Huaqiang quilt covers were traded at 9.4 million yuan. Dachung checkered 壁绉 opened at 35,700 yuan and was once bid at 6,000 yuan. There were also slight transactions, but the price was low again, and the bid price returned to 5,700 yuan, about 200 yuan less than Saturday. Rayon goods, Huajin 绉 and 羽纱, were traded at 17,500 yuan yesterday, slightly less than the bid price on Saturday, and Shenghang and other goods had little change.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Brokers Subscribing to US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs notified the Securities Exchange that part of the margin deposits must be changed to US dollar bonds, it was heard that brokers were planning to set up a Brokerage Subscription to US Dollar Bonds Custody Committee to solve the current difficulties and facilitate customer transactions. Each broker will subscribe to 10,000 US dollar bonds and hand them over to the Custody Committee for safekeeping. The funds will be lent to brokers for use based on the Securities Exchange's deposit account balance. It is expected that deferred transactions can continue as usual in the future.</p>
<h3>Plywood Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of wood plywood rose because factory wages increased and factory quotations increased by 20%. The prices of other wood remained flat.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Resumes Allocating Rayon</h3>
<p>The rayon sold by the Central Trust Bureau used to have a large gap between the allocated price and the market price. The market price of Tianqiao brand rose to 18.9 million, while the allocation price was still 5.3 million, which was unreasonable. A special report was submitted to the Executive Yuan for another price determination. Last week, the bureau received the Executive Yuan's approval. The approved price for Tianqiao brand was 9.8 million per box, the approved price for Dongyang, Jin Sanma, Peacock, and Earth brands was 9.6 million, and the approved price for Gaoshan and Zao Ri brands was 9.4 million. After receiving the order, the bureau resumed allocation yesterday (2nd). Three hundred and fifteen silk weaving companies in the city applied for a total of 1,780 boxes in advance, but the result of the allocation was only 178 boxes, and all were settled at the new price.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Committee for the Sale of Government Materials and Property, acting on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, allocated rayon for the 29th time yesterday (2nd). A total of 315 silk weaving companies applied, and the allocation was made at one-tenth of the total allocation in December last year, totaling 178 boxes.</p>

<h3>Police-Civilian Cooperation to Eradicate Opium</h3>
<p>— Xuan Tiewu</p>
<p>It has been one century and eight years since the 6/3 Opium Suppression Memorial Day. Yet, we still need to cry out and work for opium suppression. One cannot help but feel extremely emotional about this!</p>
<p>The history of China's opium suppression is also the history of the Chinese nation's struggle to resist the aggression and exploitation of international imperialists. More than a century ago, the Opium War, which was caused by opium suppression, was the first shot fired by imperialism to open up China's closed-door policy. It was also the first step in turning China into a semi-colony of international imperialists. Since then, China's coastal ports - all important commercial ports - were completely in the hands of imperialists under the constraints of unequal treaties. As a result, opium, red pills, white powder, and heroin flowed in large quantities from the coastal cities to all of China under the pretext of promoting commercial prosperity. They became the most vicious weapons for imperialists to extract money from the Chinese people and paralyze their nerves!</p>
<p>Due to the weakness and incompetence of the Manchu Qing government, China's first and most important opium suppression work suffered a failure and paid a heavy price.</p>
<p>Thus, for nearly a hundred years, the awakened outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have not only had to fight for the revival of the nation and the independence of the country, but also to fight for the eradication of opium. They have not only had to struggle against international imperialists, but also against opium, an important tool for imperialist rule and colonization. The struggle for national revival and national independence is certainly very difficult, but the struggle against opium can also be said to be a struggle against the shackles and influences that imperialists have imposed on the Chinese people - especially the people in concessions - in terms of spirit, consciousness, and even daily life.</p>
<p>In the past fifty years, under the wise and outstanding leadership of the father of the Republic of China - President Sun, and his successor President Chiang, the outstanding children of the Chinese nation, from the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, have already broken free from the status of a semi-colony and leapt to become one of the strong countries. This means that we have won the struggle against imperialists. However, the unequal treaties were canceled as early as during the war, and the concessions have been recovered for nearly two years. Yet, the shackles and influences that imperialists have imposed on the Chinese people - especially the people in concessions - in terms of spirit, consciousness, and daily life (opium is one of them) have not been eradicated with the cancellation of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions.</p>
<p>The harm of opium to addicts is so profound that it not only harms themselves, but also their children and grandchildren. The reason why Shanghai has more opium addicts than other places is that, in the beginning, they were protected by the concessions, and the Chinese government's ban could not be extended. Later, during the occupation period, the policy of poisoning was one of the important strategies of the enemy and the puppet regime. In the middle of the concessions, there were many people with money and leisure who aimed to enjoy life. As a result, opium formed an indissoluble bond with this group. After the recovery, although the authorities repeatedly issued orders and announcements to persuade and even punish severely, it is necessary to have great perseverance and determination to quit opium, and to have the patience to endure the pain of opium addiction. This determination and patience are exactly what most addicts lack. Therefore, although Shanghai has been recovered for nearly two years, opium has not yet been eradicated.</p>
<p>In the current advanced countries, opium is only used as a medical drug. In Shanghai, an international city, there are still people who smoke and indulge in opium. This is not only a shame for Shanghai, but also a shame for all of China. We want to make Shanghai a modern city, and we want to make Shanghai a representative of China. We must eradicate opium in Shanghai within the shortest possible time and rescue Shanghai from the poisonous atmosphere of opium.</p>
<p>The government authorities should list the eradication of opium as one of the central tasks and severely punish those who manufacture, sell, traffic, and transport opium. However, to prevent every citizen from smoking opium, it is necessary for all citizens to cooperate with the authorities' decisions and assist them.</p>
<p>Everyone may doubt that strict opium suppression is the job of the police bureau. Why do the people need to assist? How can ordinary citizens without power assist in opium suppression? It is true that opium suppression is the responsibility of the police bureau, but for the police bureau to fulfill this responsibility, it really needs the assistance of all citizens. As for the specific methods of assistance, we can start with the following two points:</p>
<p>1. Persuade to Quit Opium: Whether he is your relative, family member, friend, fellow villager, neighbor... As long as he is a person who smokes opium, you should sincerely persuade him, explain the harm of opium to him, and tell him that smoking opium is an illegal act. Make the addict determined to quit under your persuasion.</p>
<p>2. Secretly Report and Expose: People who smoke opium are social pests. The existence of these pests is of no benefit to the country or the family, in public or in private. Therefore, we must report those opium addicts who do not listen to advice to the authorities, and the government will force them to quit. You must never condone relatives and friends, because the result of condoning is ultimately harming your relatives and friends. As for those who manufacture, transport, and sell opium, they are even more sinners of society. Every citizen should secretly report to the authorities when they hear news of manufacturing, transporting, and selling opium. The government will reward those who break the case due to secret reports.</p>
<p>I believe that now that police power has been unified, and the government authorities are actively working hard in accordance with their consistent methods, if they can obtain the practical assistance of the general public, opium in Shanghai will definitely be eradicated in the shortest possible time!</p>

<h3>Smoking and Nation Building</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhi</p>
<p>Today (the 63rd year of the Republic) marks the 108th anniversary of Mr. Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen. As we are now embarking on nation-building, with countless tasks and everything requiring our accelerated efforts, we commemorate our predecessor. On one hand, we must strengthen our resolve to prohibit opium and build the nation, aspiring to emulate the sages; on the other hand, we should learn from the past to strengthen our concept of self-reliance and striving for strength. We know that for an individual to develop their career, they must first have a healthy body and abundant spirit, as the saying goes, "One point of spirit, one point of career." By extension, the wealth and strength of a country, the prosperity of a nation, cannot be achieved without a strong citizenry first. As the saying goes, a strong country must first have a strong people, and a strong people must first have a strong race. There is no country in the world where the people are poor, weak, and sickly, yet the country is wealthy, strong, and prosperous.</p>
<p>Since the late Qing Daoguang era, when the Qing government's internal affairs were corrupt and the country was weak, Indian opium was imported into our country in large quantities, catering to the desires of our people. The magnitude of its harm and the intensity of its toxicity can be said to be worse than airplanes and artillery. It not only made individuals mentally depressed and careers ruined, but it could even lead to the demise of a country and the extinction of a race. Therefore, Lin Zexu once cried out loudly, "If this disaster is not eliminated, there will be no usable soldiers and no funds to raise in ten years." During the eight-year war of resistance, the enemy manufactured highly potent drugs everywhere in our occupied territories, such as morphine, heroin, red pills, and white powder, and openly set up establishments, forcing our compatriots to smoke them. Their intention was to turn our Chinese nation into opium addicts and ghosts, barely able to continue the war of resistance, forcing us to national subjugation and racial extermination. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued an explicit decree at the time: "We must resist the war on one hand and prohibit opium on the other." Today, the work of nation-building is a "heavy burden and a long road," and its difficulty is even greater than the war of resistance. Every youth and every compatriot must have a strong physique and abundant spirit to strive for self-improvement and take on great responsibilities. Therefore, today, to accelerate the work of nation-building, we should strengthen the prohibition of opium even more.</p>
<p>However, the work of prohibiting opium has lasted for more than a hundred years, yet it still cannot be completely eradicated. News of drug trafficking and drug use is still occasionally seen in the newspapers. This not only gives people a sense of fatigue but even makes the general public doubt the policy of opium prohibition. Examining the reasons, in addition to the fact that some local governments cannot conscientiously implement the central government's opium prohibition laws, mostly perfunctory, making the work of opium prohibition enter a stubborn state, the main reason lies in the fact that some compatriots who are addicted to opium lack self-awareness and cannot have the determination to die yesterday and be reborn today. They even devise ways to evade and secretly smoke, willingly degenerating. At the same time, the general public does not recognize that the work of opium prohibition is related to the survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation. Everyone should assist the government and work hard to promote it. They only manage "sweeping the snow in front of their own doors" and cannot bravely report it. Some even help to conceal it due to family and friendship. This is also the reason why the government's opium prohibition work cannot be thoroughly promoted.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the widespread drug policy of the enemy in our occupied areas during the eight-year war of resistance, as mentioned above, which means that after our recovery today, the work of opium prohibition must start from scratch. At the same time, the Communist Party still widely plants opium in the so-called "liberated areas" and uses ignorant people to steal and transport it, not hesitating to poison compatriots and sabotage government orders, thereby taxing and raising troops, splitting up the area, and rebelling against the government. Therefore, the entire work of opium prohibition has been hindered. Today, as we commemorate our predecessors, we should recognize the disease and focus on the current situation. Compatriots who are addicted to opium should have the determination to die yesterday and be reborn today, and automatically repent and reform. The general public must recognize the severity of the opium scourge, adopt the attitude of persuading and admonishing people to do good and correct their mistakes, bravely report it, and unite to demand that the armed rebellious Communist Party lay down their weapons, stop splitting up the area, stop acts of undermining government orders, and abolish the so-called "liberated areas." One country cannot allow two different numbered armies, and one country cannot allow two governments. They should immediately return the military to the country and the government to the people, so that the country's military and government orders can be unified and thoroughly eliminate the opium scourge that has plagued our country for more than a hundred years.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once instructed us: "I sincerely hope with twelve-hundred-thousand parts sincerity that all compatriots in the country must use the same spirit of resisting the war and killing the enemy, work together with one heart, assist the government, implement the opium prohibition policy, and everyone regards opium prohibition as their own responsibility." Today, we should be vigilant of this instruction from the head of state, strengthen our concept of self-reliance and striving, take on our own responsibilities, work together to eradicate opium, eradicate all reactionary forces that hinder the work of opium prohibition and nation-building, and complete the construction of our Three Principles of the People China.</p>
<h3>Travel Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Part 1) The Full Picture of the Revived Southeastern Artery</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, May 29th Quick News Reporter Huang Xingtian from this newspaper</p>
<p>Winding through the mountains of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, connecting the Guangdong-Han, Shanghai-Nanjing, and Ningbo railways, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is a major artery in the southeast. It not only solves the difficulty of "walking with difficulty" for travelers and provides opportunities for the sale and development of local products along the line but also facilitates the exchange of essential goods and rice for the livelihood of the people in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. Therefore, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is of extreme importance in the lives of the people in the southeast. Due to the complete destruction during the War of Resistance, the recovery of this artery, which bears a heavy responsibility and has made great efforts for the War of Resistance, has been difficult. The lack of funds and materials has made the recovery, despite the desperate efforts of the Railway Bureau over the past two years, only to extend the main line to Jinhua and the branch line to Lanxi. What I call "desperate" is not an exaggeration. Within the possible limits of funds and materials, the Railway Bureau employees have indeed broken the record in the history of road construction with the greatest speed, with an average of 2.6 kilometers of rail laying per day. Their highest record has reached 4.2 kilometers. If any recovery and construction work can be done with this spirit, then it will greatly reduce the broken remains on our country's land.</p>
<p>Now, the full-line track recovery project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has established five engineering offices in Zhuji-Quzhou, Rao-Xiang, Xunnan, Nanchun, and Chunzhu to carry out track recovery work separately. The Zhuji-Quzhou section, which is 188.500 kilometers long, and the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line, which is 122.77 kilometers long, are mainly repaired by the Zhuji-Quzhou section engineering office. There are eight large bridges, sixteen small bridges, one first-class ticket office, three third-class ticket offices, and four fourth-class ticket offices in these two sections, all of which have been completed and opened to traffic. Currently under construction is the Jinhua-Quzhou section, which is more than 80 kilometers long. There are eleven large bridges, fifteen small bridges, one hundred and seventeen culverts, one open channel, two third-class ticket offices, five fourth-class ticket offices, and other equipment that have been completely destroyed by the enemy and need to be repaired. The project is arduous. In order to speed up the work, the Railway Bureau has divided the large bridges above 100 meters on the entire line into three areas and established large bridge engineering offices separately. The first area is located in Jinhua, supervising the repair of five bridges between Jinhua and Quzhou, including the Jinhua River, Lingshan Port, and Dongxi River. The bridge piers of each bridge have now been completed 90%. The second area is located in Liangjiadu, supervising the repair of large bridges between Shangrao and Nanchang, including Shangwan Port, Dengjia Port, and the tributary of the Fu River. The third area is located in Zhangshu, supervising the repair of large bridges between Nanchang and Pingxiang, including Jiaxi, Shanqian, the tributary of the Gan River, and Yuanshan. The bridge work in the Jinhua-Quzhou section is the most difficult. The reporter once went to Jinhua to observe the restoration project of the Jinhua River Bridge. The bridge is 282.945 meters long and 18 meters high, with a total of twelve holes. During the War of Resistance, enemy aircraft bombed it again and again, but failed to destroy it. Later, due to the withdrawal of the National Army, it destroyed six bridge piers itself. Now it has been repaired, but steel beams and steel bars are still lacking. According to Engineer Wang, the person in charge, who told the reporter: "The weather is good this year and the water level is low, so the construction is very convenient, but there is a lack of equipment. When we repaired the No. 9 bridge pier, we could only borrow a farmer's waterwheel for simultaneous use because the water pump was not enough, and it took more than 20 days. If there are no steel beams, we can only use wooden beams and change them to semi-permanent."</p>
<p>The reporter took a car from Hangzhou to Jinhua and Zhuji, passing through the entire revived Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He felt that the Jinhua-Lanxi branch line was the most stable and fastest. The situation in the Zhuji-Jinhua section is also good; while the travel in the Hangzhou-Zhuji section is very bumpy, only 20 kilometers per hour. Therefore, the entire journey from Hangzhou to Jinhua is 190 kilometers, and the journey takes eight hours. The main reason is that the Hangzhou-Zhuji section uses 70-pound steel rails, and some of the sleepers have rotted; the Jinhua-Lanxi section uses 90-pound heavy rails, and the sleepers are brand new. "For the safety of the train," Commissioner Zhang Zongyao of the Railway Bureau told the reporter: "We are gradually repairing the tracks in the Hangzhou-Zhuji section, but due to the lack of village materials, we can only replace them sporadically for the time being; on the one hand, we are trying to strengthen the 36 relatively weak bridges among them, so that vehicles with a load of more than 40 tons can run. In order to cooperate with the development of the national construction railway transportation network, the Railway Bureau is determined to gradually revive this transportation hub across the southeastern provinces, enrich the equipment, cooperate with the machinery department, strengthen the transportation efficiency, and plan to build a large machine factory of 200 acres in Xiaoshan to manufacture other star material accessories. The most serious problem at present is the problem of vehicles. There are only six third-class passenger cars and three baggage cars in the Hangzhou-Shaoxing section; after the Hangzhou-Lanxi section is opened to traffic, the route is extended by one time, and passenger and freight transportation increases daily. Although the Ministry of Communications has allocated ten parts of freight cars and merchants have been recruited to undertake the construction of six passenger cars, it is still not enough. In order to cope with the current passenger transportation, 20 passenger cars and 150 freight cars have been borrowed from the Jinpu Railway in Qingdao. If the entire line is opened to traffic, the need for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars will be even more urgent."</p>
<p>The direct train between Hangzhou and Lanxi is scheduled to start on the 25th of this month. The joint transportation between Shanghai and Jiangxi has been agreed upon with the two railway bureaus and can be implemented immediately. The Ministry of Communications has decided to complete the full-line opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway within the year. In the attention of the government and the eager expectations of the people, we hope that the employees of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau can continue the working spirit of the Jin-Zhu section, create new records anytime and anywhere, and quickly restore this major artery that connects the economy and culture of the southeastern provinces!</p>
<h3>Big Lanxi County, Small Jinhua Prefecture</h3>
<p>"Big Lanxi County, small Jinhua Prefecture," this sentence has become a realistic portrayal again after the war. As the train passed through the fields of golden wheat ears and the forests of fine-leaved jujube trees, the first impression of Jinhua was that Jinhua retained her simplicity and honesty, but she had lost her former prosperity. From 1938 to 1941, it was the golden age of Jinhua. "Small Jinhua Prefecture" far surpassed "Big Lanxi County." The population increased to more than 100,000, becoming the only transit point in eastern China during the War of Resistance. Thousands of small merchants, porters, and smugglers came and went endlessly, crowding the more than 200 temporary hotels, smuggling a large amount of materials from Hangzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, and the entire enemy-occupied area across the blockade line, passing through here, and dispersing to the rear. At that time, Jinhua was truly a glorious city. But just like the changes in the Jinhua River, the Jinhua River was turbulent in 1939, a normal river close to Jinhua; in 1941, the water flow gradually decreased; today, the water is shallow and the river is wide, and large sandbars rise in the middle of the river. The water flow does not have a definite mainstream, and it does not look like a big river at all. And Jinhua, after the ravages of the enemy cavalry, victory deprived her of her prominent economic position, causing the market to decline eight times and the population to decrease five times, falling behind Lanxi again. Therefore, some people say: "Jinhua was a nouveau riche during the war, and now it is a ruined family that cannot be restored." But I think Jinhua's inability to recover is temporary. The War of Resistance has changed the ancient appearance of her prefecture city and has the spirit and scale of a modern city. As long as the entire line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is open to traffic, and with more active construction, Jinhua will definitely be able to regain her youth.</p>
<p>Although the economic value of Jinhua has declined, her local economy can still be self-sufficient. The annual output of rice is 1,795,000 dans, wheat is 154,000 dans, soybeans are 30,000 dans, and miscellaneous grains are 498,000 dans. The grain output is not only self-sufficient but also has a small amount of exports. The annual output of rosin is 12,400 dans, and tung oil is 8,800 dans, which are important specialties and are all exported. Although ham is named after Jinhua, the important production areas are in Dongyang (20,000 dans) and Fuyang (5,000 dans). Jinhua not only has a small output, but also cannot buy good top-quality hams in the market. In addition, tea, lime, Buddha's hand citron, jasmine, writing brushes, paper umbrellas, and firecrackers are also important specialties of Jinhua.</p>

<p>Rather than saying that Jinhua is the political and economic city of eastern Zhejiang, it is better to say that she is the cultural city of eastern Zhejiang. Now Jinhua has a National Yingshi University, a Provincial Jinhua High School, three private high schools: Zuoxin, Chengmei, and Sanwu, one Ba Wu Girls' High School, one Simplified Normal School, and one Provincial Jinhua Agricultural Vocational School. There are 25 Central National Schools, 202 Bao National Schools, two private elementary schools, and 75 junior elementary schools. In terms of social education, there is one Provincial People's Education Center and two People's Lecture Halls. Following the large number of schools, there are nine bookstores, including Commercial Press and Victory, where you can buy the latest magazines published in Shanghai, but new books are very scarce. There is only one tabloid "Guide News," which is smaller in scale and poorer in content than other second-tier counties in eastern Zhejiang. This is an abnormal bad phenomenon. Fortunately, you can see the current newspapers of Shanghai and Hangzhou, which can slightly relieve the hunger of spiritual food.</p>
<p>Yingshi University is a beautiful flower in the cultural circles of eastern Zhejiang, but recently, the student unrest at Yingshi University broke the tranquility of the cultural city and shocked the whole country. The focus of the student unrest is that the students are dissatisfied with the simple temporary school buildings and demand to move to Nanjing or Hangzhou. For this reason, the reporter made a special visit. The entire school has only four colleges, but they are distributed in five areas, and only the College of Engineering is concentrated in one place. The others are scattered and disorganized. A single College of Liberal Arts, classrooms and student dormitories are scattered in five places, which is bound to cause student dissatisfaction. The main reason is that the school does not have its own buildings and can only rent private houses, using temples, shrines, and ancestral halls. Some of the leases are about to expire. The simplicity of the houses is unimaginable to the people of Shanghai. The lime walls shake when you touch them, there are no electric lights, and there are no glass windows. The president's office is just like the temporary room of an engineer. Therefore, teachers and students of the entire school expressed great dissatisfaction with the school buildings. According to the current acting president, Zhou Shang, Dean of the College of Engineering, he told the reporter: "Our school currently has more than 80,000 books and instrument equipment that is no less than ordinary universities, which can be used for any kind of experiment. And the environment of Jinhua is quiet and the folk customs are simple and honest, which is suitable for concentrating on studying. Therefore, the focus of the problem is not moving the school, but the need for a permanent school building of its own. If the relocation fee of 10 billion yuan is used to move the school to another place without existing school buildings, it is better to build school buildings in Jinhua." I think Dean Zhou's words are very right. In fact, the permanent school buildings of Jinhua have long been designed, and the estimated cost is 30 billion yuan. Now that prices are soaring, it costs about 60 billion yuan. If the Ministry of Education really wants to complete his national university network plan, then he should allocate this fund as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lanxi is purely a commercial city. The water conservancy of the Fuchun River has created a superior position as a water transportation center for it. The prosperity of the market far exceeds that of "Jinhua Prefecture." The current population is 278,826. Each person has an average of nearly two acres of cultivated land. The annual output of rice is 2 million dans, wheat is 300,000 dans, and miscellaneous grains are 70,000 dans. The main specialties are rosin 35,000 dans, candied dates 50,000 dans, tung oil 5,000 dans, bayberries 3,000 dans, and ham 5,000 dans. The export of ham is about 64,000 pieces, tung oil 5,000 dans, and rosin 15,000 dans; imports are mainly daily necessities. There is a glass factory and a cotton textile factory in the county seat, although the output is not very abundant; the family industry is mainly the textile industry, and the number of people engaged in it is about 10,000. The county's farmland tax quota is 88,376 shi, and 80,266 shi have been collected, with a percentage of 91%. The quota for various donations and taxes reaches 805,150,000 yuan, but only 10.9% has been collected. But in any case, compared with Jinhua, Lanxi is much more prosperous.</p>
<h3>Jinhua Cave is Far Better than Seven Star Cave</h3>
<p>Beishan Scenic Spot is one of the "36 Grotto Heavens and 72 Blessed Lands" mentioned by Taoists in the past. It was famous in the Tang Dynasty and flourished in the Song Dynasty, and it is the most peculiar and beautiful place in eastern Zhejiang. People who have been to Jinhua always feel that although the mountains and rivers of Guilin are the best in the world, the Seven Star Cave of Guilin is not as good as the Jinhua Cave. Jinhua Cave is the general name of Shuanglong, Binghu, and Chaozhen three caves. It is located in Beishan (ie, Jinhua Mountain), 26 li away from Jinhua County. You can take a car from Jinhua to Luodian, a distance of eight kilometers, which can be reached in 15 minutes. From Luodian to the north, only ten li, walk along the stream, the mountains rise and fall and the sound of water gurgles; the scenery is beautiful, much better than the Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines of Hangzhou. Along the way, there are also the ancient sites of An Qisheng's hometown, the tomb of Princess Kangyi Qin of the Song Dynasty, and the Buddha Longevity Pavilion.</p>
<p>Shuanglong Cave faces east and faces west. It is located at the northwest foot of Jinhua Mountain, 1,050 feet above Jinhua City. It is adjacent to Binghu and Chaozhen Caves. There are two natural stalactite dragon heads at the outer cave entrance, protruding from the cave entrance, one of which has been lost. The cave entrance is extremely large, with a width and depth of more than ten feet. The light is sufficient, and it can accommodate two or three hundred people. There are scenery such as "Mr. Lu's hiding place," Big Dipper star nests, fairy plums, stone clouds, and stone Taoists, all of which are the works of stalactites. There is a hole in the depths of the outer cave, like a toad's chin, and clear springs flow out of it, which will not dry up even in drought or flood. Going upstream, it is the inner cave. There is a very large flat-bottomed rock on the spring, only a foot away from the water surface. Therefore, to visit from the outer cave to the inner cave, you must lie on your back on a small boat, light a gasoline lamp to lead the way, and enter with a rope pulling the boat. At this moment, people's spirit is extremely tense. You must hold your breath and lie still, watching large pieces of rock closely pass by your face, your heart beating rapidly, with a psychological feeling of terror and curiosity, as if passing through the cave leading to the Plum Blossom Source, or driving to another strange world. The inner cave is indeed a strange place, deeper and wider than the outer cave, and more tortuous and strange. The entire cave is dark, and you must light a lamp to lead the way. Looking up when entering the cave, there are two stone dragons, yellow and green, opening their mouths and holding their claws, coiling around the left and right. Therefore, it is named Shuanglong. The cave walls are glittering, like flying dragons, like lions and tigers, like immortals and Buddhas, like clothes and shoes, like rising and lying. According to Xie Ao's "Record of Figures and Ancient Sites of Jinhua Cave" in the Song Dynasty, there are 57 kinds in total. There are still inscriptions on the cave walls from the Tang and Song dynasties, and the stone carvings carved in the fourth year of Wanli are the clearest. The inner cave is warm in winter and cool in summer. The reporter sweated in single clothes outside the cave, and still did not feel warm when he put on a jacket in the cave!</p>

<h3>Reading Wen Tianxiang's Poems</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>Judging solely on the military successes or failures, Wen Tianxiang's career can be said to be insignificant. The time involved was short, and there were only a few small, fleeting battles that ended in defeat. He was purely a scholar who had only held a few local official positions. During Jia Sidao's time in power, he was unwilling to advance in his career. At the age of thirty-six, he developed the Wenshan new residence, with quite the intention of retiring, saying himself: "I intend to wait until forty-three years old, then request retirement, like the story of Qian Ruoshui." In 1275, on July 7th, he raised an army to support the emperor. By August, he had reached Hangzhou. The following January, Yuan forces had already surrounded Lin'an. On January 20th, he entered the Yuan camp to negotiate peace. On February 8th, he was forced to travel north by the Yuan forces. On the 29th, he escaped in Zhenjiang, and after countless hardships, fled to Fujian in April. The following year, he went to southern Jiangxi to raise an army, starting his activities in May, and achieving two small victories in June. On August 27th, his army was defeated at Kongkeng. Such battles were simply no match for the Yuan forces. "In August, Li Guida with 1,000 regular troops and several thousand militia stationed at Zhongbu. They encountered the northern army, and the militia was frightened and scattered. Within ten days, Bian (Zhang Bian), Shang (Zhao Shishang), and Shen (Zhao Mengying) led tens of thousands of militia to besiege Ganzhou. The northern army charged with a hundred-odd cavalry, and the crowd fled." (See Chronicle Record) After this defeat, he traveled from Fujian to Guangdong. The following June, he visited the young emperor at Yai Shan. On December 20th, he was captured by Zhang Hongfan's troops at Haifeng. The above is the complete political and military activities of this great figure throughout the ages. From a utilitarian point of view, these activities are too insignificant to be worth mentioning. I specifically point this out to show that the career of a great person is not necessarily built on a foundation of utility.</p>
<p>There is a supremely great spirit in Chinese culture, the so-called "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it." Calculating the situation, one clearly knows that there is no hope of success, but one cannot let go of this conviction; one can only feel at peace by doing it no matter what. Therefore, one completely abandons the calculation of success, failure, benefit, and loss, and even refrains from harboring illusory hopes, but simply does what one believes should be done according to this conviction. When he started his uprising in Jiangxi, "His friends stopped him, saying: 'Now the great army is advancing with great momentum, breaking through the suburbs and approaching the heartland. You are going to meet them with a motley crowd of ten thousand, which is no different from driving a flock of sheep to fight a ferocious tiger.' Tianxiang said: 'I also know that this is the case, but the state has nurtured its subjects for more than three hundred years. Now, in a time of crisis, not a single soldier or horse in the entire country has entered the pass. I deeply resent this, so I do not overestimate my strength and sacrifice myself for the state.'"—Song History: Biography. The Chronicle Record records his own response to Bo Luo's question: "Since you know it cannot be done, why do it?" He replied, "A subject serves his ruler as a son serves his father. If the father unfortunately falls ill, even if one knows it cannot be cured, how can one not give medicine? I am doing my best; if it cannot be saved, then it is fate." These two passages best explain the principle of "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it." Whether things succeed or not is left to fate. As long as the principle that should be done can be demonstrated and spread, naturally someone will continue to do it, and the situation will gradually change. Eventually, one day, this principle will be revealed to the world, and this matter will be successful. It was ultimately Wen Tianxiang, Lu Xiufu, and Zhang Shijie who drove away the Yuan people. With military strength unparalleled throughout history, the Yuan dynasty swept across Eurasia, invincible, but could not defeat these few individuals.</p>
<p>Wen Tianxiang's important works include "Guide Records," "Sequel to Guide Records," "Collection of Chanting and Whistling," and "Collected Du Poems." The other poems were written before his service to the emperor and are not enough to fully express his unique sentiments. "Sequel to Guide Records" starts with the poem "Crossing the Han Dingyang on the Twelfth Day of the First Month of the Year Ji Mao," when he had already been captured by the Yuan army, and ends with the poem on the Dragon Boat Festival in the Year Ren Wu (there are a few poems after this, but the dates are unknown), a period of four years. He was killed in December of that year. The time of "Collection of Chanting and Whistling" is not very verifiable, roughly from the time he was arrested until Xin Ji (the year before his death). The number of poems is not large, and the time overlaps with "Sequel to Guide Records." "Collected Du Poems" consists of two hundred poems, collecting five-character lines from Du Fu's works to form five-character quatrains, recording the experience of disorder and separation. It was completed in the Year Geng Chen (two years before his death). "Guide Records" records the journey from his mission to the north to being forced to travel north, then escaping midway and traveling to Wenzhou. From January 13th to April 8th. In the preface, "One volume is for the mission to the Northern Camp staying outside the Northern Pass. One volume is for leaving the Northern Pass, passing through Wumen, Piling, Guazhou, and returning to Jingkou. One volume is for escaping Jingkou and going to Zhenzhou, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Taizhou, and Tongzhou. One volume is for traveling from the sea to Yongjia and coming to Sanshan." There are a total of 178 poems, mostly seven-character quatrains. Most of the poems have prefaces, detailing the intervening events.</p>
<p>Among poets of all ages, none has been in a more difficult situation than Wen Tianxiang. On the one hand, he bore the responsibility of national politics, and on the other hand, he lived the most impoverished life. Two sons and six daughters all died in the war. He was imprisoned for four years and finally martyred for his country. After being imprisoned, he was simply determined, not losing his integrity, only seeking death. The period recorded in the Guide Records, on the one hand, was the most dangerous, and on the other hand, he harbored hope, not daring to sacrifice himself. His mood at this time was the most distressed. The six poems recording events precisely express this mood: "The affairs of the Three Palaces and Nine Temples are precarious, the wolf's ambition is still unknown. If there is no one to subdue the mad barbarians, which man in the southeast is a man?" (One) "Figures of Spring and Autumn are capable of speech, the nation often survives by words. I also face danger with eloquence. The north wind fills the wilderness, bearing the universe." (Two) "A hero is unwilling to rest before death. The wind rises, the clouds fly, freedom is lost. Kill me and send me outside the Hun Tong River, surely there is no Cao Han to guard Youzhou!" (Six) "A hero is unwilling to rest before death!" What kind of spirit is this! In difficult circumstances, prolonged imprisonment, he never gave up hope. Until seven years after the fall of the Song Dynasty, five years after Yai Shan, he finally did not yield, and this stemmed precisely from this kind of spirit.</p>
<p>One of the two Wang's poems says, "A single horse crossed the river and opened the Jin Dynasty, five dragons supported the sun and restored the Tang Dynasty. The descendants of the imperial family are truly blessed, the fate of the barbarians has never lasted a hundred years." Because he held this kind of hope, he constantly planned to escape. Returning to Jingkou, he wrote, "I will leave early like Tian Wen, never stay like Su Wu. I would rather die by the sword than endure death and burn the boat. The escaping steed thinks of surpassing the ride, the flying falcon aspires to escape the reins. Ascending the tower and looking at the river, I count the boats every day." Later, he finally escaped in Jingkou. Du Hu was in charge of everything for him. This was a righteous man who always stood by Wen Tianxiang's side and died of illness after being captured after the defeat at Yai Shan. The twelve lines of the Seven Quatrains of Escaping Jingkou depict the infinite suffering of the time. Arriving at Zhenzhou, he discussed with Miao Zaicheng, planning to send out all the troops, harboring dreams of restoration. At that time, he had a poem that said: "Nanba returned in vain when the Tang fortress fell, Bao Xu went out once and the Chu territory was restored. Now the survival of the country is decided, it all depends on the advance and retreat of the commander-in-chief." But this was only a dream. He was immediately driven away by Li Tingzhi. This unwarranted misunderstanding added another layer of hardship to this great man with a heart of steel.</p>
<p>The poem "Leaving Zhenzhou" at the age of thirty-three resonates with blood and tears. Compared to escaping from Jingkou, not only is the time longer, but the mood is also vastly different. "The Qin River cries with blood forming a stream, surprisingly Zhonghang can be whipped on the back. The north and south both know the bitterness of loyalty and righteousness. In my life, I only lack the fate of Lianghuai." Reaching this state, he almost thought that his fate was so doomed. After being expelled from the city, Miao Zaicheng led a small team to escort him, originally intending to suspect him and investigate the truth. But Wen Tianxiang, with his heart set on the monarch and the country, was determined to meet with Li Tingzhi to distinguish right from wrong, and finally moved the escort, who pointed out the road to Yangzhou: "A thousand gold braved danger to escape Shi Qiu, who would have thought that the southern bandits would be alarmed instead? Remember the matter outside the Xiaoxi Gate, every year on Shangsi Festival, weep at the river!" "What do you want to do getting off your horse in the wilderness! Life and death are up to you. If it weren't for the white soldiers having eyes, who would know there is a ball of grievances?" "I will cut off my head and face Guangling, I have no one to appeal to in heaven. It is better to entrust my life to the East Sea, still riding the wind near the Jade Capital." After arriving in Yangzhou, he was not allowed to enter, and the area outside the city for hundreds of miles was within the sphere of influence of the northern army. Four people from his entourage stole gold and fled. Fortunately, he met a woodcutter who led him through a secret path to Gaosha. On the way to Gaosha, he encountered a northern army patrol - many of his companions were killed or wounded. Even such a man of iron will said, "After the pain subsides, I think about the pain, and the tears are like rain." The five-character poem "Immediate Events in Ji Zhuang" says: "Gaining the heart of the royal family, I march south day and night. Treading on danger, I would rather not regret it, holding loyalty, I would rather see it clear. The sound of geese connects with the color of the water, distant mountains are level with the sky. In vain I cry on the desolate road, a man seeks death in life."</p>
<p>From Gaoyou, Hailing, Rugao, he turned to Tongzhou, and obtained a sea boat, and then floated to Wenzhou. But no matter how difficult, he never frustrated his ambition. The five-character poem "Immediate Events" says: "Crying bitterly, I bid farewell to the Jingguan, walking secretly, I visited the seagate. I have not heard the crowing of a chicken for a long time, and I have new lice to feel. White hair should grow more, and there are few servants left. But if my body is not dead, I will repay the universe with all my strength." This kind of dedication, giving one's all until death, is the spirit of our country's patriots and benevolent people. Because of this spirit, no matter how unwilling to admit defeat, one will eventually achieve the long-cherished wish. The seven-character poem "Arriving in Wenzhou" says: "Thousands of miles of wind and frost have streaked my temples, adrift, looking back, my ambition is sad. Has snow come down under Mount Luofu? Who does the moon shine on at the head of the Yangtze River? I only said that the tiger's head was not a noble appearance, I did not expect the ram's teat to have a return date! Taking the tide to Zhongchuan Temple, I secretly read the second stele of Zhongxing." The five-character poem "Self-Lamentation" says: "Sleeping on the grass, exposed to the dew, dining on pine, standing in the evening wind. I lament my existence in chaos and separation, who shares the hardships! Zu Yao has the ambition to cross rivers and mountains, Cheng Ying has the merit of the state. I plan for a hundred years, the universe is vast and boundless!"</p>
<p>Reading Wen Tianxiang's poems, I am filled with sorrow and melancholy, truly evoking countless emotions. Chinese poetry is mainly gentle and honest, using allegory as its method. It does not directly express personal feelings much. The purpose of writing poetry is to seek peace in poverty, so like Du Fu, even when experiencing hardship, one often uses humorous self-deprecation. Only Wen Tianxiang disregards everything, fully expressing his grief and indignation. This is truly a sound of decline. However, just as his "righteous spirit" exists between heaven and earth, making every reader stand upright and resist corruption, this kind of work fully expresses the spirit of knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it, which cannot be fully explained by my country's poetry or Western tragic theory.

<p>Last spring I wandered in a dark place</p>
<p>Where brothers cried with chains</p>
<p>They washed the years and swords with tears</p>
<p>This spring I reopened to that place</p>
<p>A thousand cliffs and crevices full of wild grass</p>
<p>With green little leaves seeking the distant sunlight</p>

<p>Thousands of years of chains will eventually be shattered</p>

<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Jiao Ben</p>
<p>Walking halfway up the mountain from I don't know where,</p>
<p>—A string of venomous vines hanging around my ears laughed:</p>
<p>It grabbed my neck,</p>
<p>While shaking its arms,</p>
<p>While seemingly singing said:</p>
<p>"Don't go,</p>
<p>The road ahead is dangerous——</p>
<p>No, there is no road ahead,</p>
<p>There is no sky ahead,</p>
<p>Spend a spring with me here...</p>
<p>I twisted off its arm,</p>
<p>Giving it a cold glance</p>
<p>Not saying anything in my mouth,</p>
<p>Firmly believing in my heart that tomorrow is spring.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 525</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Sorry, if we don't send out the signal, they will have to aim and attack here... Let's go inside and have a look." Shouyi, not even seeing a pistol, acted as if he were the owner of the house, opening the door with one hand and beckoning with the other, inviting He Jian to enter.</p>
<p>The first large room on the left, lit by bright lights, turned out to be a reception room. It was now empty. Two "tatami" mats were placed on the floor in the center, and several mosquito coils were burning all around. Some had burned down to one or two rings, and some were just freshly lit. The air was filled with the smell of mosquito coils and dampness. The two merely glanced around the room, knowing there was nothing much to study, and turned back to enter the living room and dining room opposite. This room, however, was full of a wide assortment of things: a broken table, a few broken chairs, three or four "Yang Yang Mi," genuine wine, beer, and other types of alcohol, some empty bottles discarded on the floor; some had leftovers, and many had not been opened; cooked fish, roasted meat, fruit, bread, and other cold dishes were plentiful, apparently a good amount had been consumed. They seemed to be divided by the table and its vicinity and did not throw things around; this was where the Japanese were more advanced than the Chinese. As long as they didn’t spit everywhere, the place was probably the headquarters of the bandits." He talked with a smile.</p>
<p>The upstairs and the three-story annex were all empty rooms. Only one large bedroom facing south also had several tatami mats on the floor, and several mosquito coils were burning. There were also several boxes piled in the corner. Near the window was a small table with paper, pens, two or three books, and three or four chairs. A stack of clothes was piled in disarray, all of which were men's kimonos.</p>
<p>"What's this?" He Jian first discovered writing in purple lines on a wall near the door.</p>
<p>"—A duckweed flower, a trumpet; bind the trumpet, welcome away the duckweed flower!—"</p>
<p>Besides these four lines of writing, which were neither poetry nor folk song, there were six small characters written at the end: "Left by Heavenly King Laozi."</p>
<p>Shouyi looked at it, chuckled, and shook his head.</p>
<p>"I understand the situation, Pingzi has been rescued, but it's a little hard to believe. Could these bandits all be dead? ... There were only four young ladies who came; no matter how great their abilities, they shouldn't have escaped without raising an alarm..." He Jian, no matter what, couldn't believe it. "Looking at the words on the wall, it shows there were two people here. That 'trumpet' is probably a morning glory, which is also a woman; tied up, presumably it's definitely someone on the enemy's side. ... Is this morning glory so easy to deal with? A trumpet should be used to attack, why use it to shout?</p>
<p>I can't guess... I'll just have to go back and ask them... "Shouyi scratched his head.</p>
<p>"...It's very simple..." Later, at Bai Ren Manor, everyone met, and He Jian, based on his Japanese education's spirit of "breaking the clay pot to get to the bottom," asked Zishan to explain the situation when rescuing Pingzi. Zishan rolled her big, round eyes and showed her little dimples, chattering and laughing as she spoke, "That group of people were playing an empty city trick; there were only nine people in total, including that female spy—she was pretending to be kidnapped together, wanting to find out the secrets of Miss Nakamura Pingzi—when we arrived, we originally wanted to force our way in, but Sister Hui didn't agree. It just so happened that we ran into Japanese soldiers on patrol, three strayed, and two idiots were left in the house ten miles away. They were probably drunk, sleeping like two dead pigs, snoring to the heavens..."</p>
<h3>The Grass-Cutting Girl</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Every day, when I push open that west-facing window, I always see a grass-cutting girl.</p>
<p>I see her wearing a patterned calico jacket, with a dark blue cloth apron tied around her waist. A light red handkerchief is tucked into her collar. Her eyebrows are slender, and her tiny fingernails are dyed red with the juice of balsam flowers.</p>
<p>That girl always sneaks into my garden from the side door of the wall. When she comes in, she carries two empty large grass baskets on her right shoulder, and clutches a shining sickle in her left hand. She walks and smiles, seeming unable to bear her coquettishness. But she also looks back step by step, seeming somewhat afraid. Finally, seeing me in front of the window, she says, "Miss! Begging for a little grass..." Her crisp voice is as gentle and soft as the spring breeze.</p>
<p>She only goes back when the sun sets in the west. When she goes back, a load of green grass fills both baskets, almost bending the small carrying pole into a curved bow. But she still walks so lightly and freely. Her right arm blocks the carrying pole, and her left arm hangs down quietly. She takes a step and swings, her small mouth humming a beautiful village song.</p>
<p>"It's such a pity about this girl, if she had grown up in the city..."</p>
<p>One day, I suddenly began to fantasize like this: I fantasized about changing the girl's patterned calico jacket into a light green silk dress; changing the dark blue cloth apron into a goose-yellow wool coat; changing the pink handkerchief tucked into her collar into a large red patent leather handbag; adding a stroke to her thin eyebrows to make them curve downwards; adding Parisian rouge to her rosy face, and applying scarlet Danqi lipstick to her small mouth, painting her fingernails with bright red and shiny Koushou lacquer... But alas——</p>
<p>But alas, I smiled sadly. I saw that the girl was no longer surrounded by tender green grass, no longer had the beautiful blue sky, no longer had the clear flowing water and quiet fields, only a chaotic, thick, black coal smoke was swirling, swirling, swirling around her...</p>
<p>Another time, I asked lightly from my mouth: "Girl! What do you do with so much grass that you cut every day?"</p>
<p>"This grass?" She raised her head and smiled blankly: "It's for my sheep!"</p>
<p>What a beautiful sound! But I pondered, pondered... Suddenly, I remembered: Wasn't that the same sound as when Christ, on the eve of being nailed to the cross, instructed his most trusted disciple Peter, "Feed my sheep!"</p>
<p>So I smiled sadly again. I seemed to see that girl, following behind a group of fierce soldiers, wearing a crown of thorns, dressed in a purple robe of sin, carrying Christ on her back with the heavy cross, walking together towards the terrifying "Mount Calvary"; the girl's face was full of tears...</p>
<p>This day, I closed that west-facing window.</p>
<p>I never saw that grass-cutting girl again, but I think of her every moment.</p>

<h3>University Education</h3>
<p>— Leike</p>
<p>When talking about China's education, everyone shakes their heads. However, when talking about China's university education, it is bound to be surprising. Because we have as many as one hundred and ninety or more (according to Hu Shi's recent words) universities. Judging from the development of our education, it can be said to be abnormally numerous.</p>
<p>Now, each university not only lacks economic strength (this was the case after the war, and before the war as well), but also lacks human resources. We don't want to praise or criticize the current university professors' character and learning here. Simply recalling the professors of several universities in Shanghai before the war is enough to make us "tremble with fear." One who taught poetry didn't know who Wu Qian'an was, and another who taught economics pronounced the "depreciate" as the "blink" of an eye. One who taught sociology couldn't even explain the textbook (in English), and another who taught elementary school turned the work of explaining the text into a calligraphy class. These are just small jokes. There are all kinds of big jokes. There are simply too many to enumerate.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that we simply don't have so many scholars qualified to serve as university professors, but we aim too high and want to run so many universities. In order to fill the positions of so many university professors, we can only (and still have not enough) promote those who are only qualified to be middle school teachers to be university professors, and those who are only qualified to be elementary school teachers (and still have not enough) are promoted to be middle school teachers. Those who are not qualified to be teachers at all cannot but be invited to elementary schools and kindergartens. As far as I can remember, before the war (what I said above was all before the war), some elementary school teachers themselves had not graduated from elementary school. What I am saying is, of course, not about every teacher or professor, but such people are indeed not in the minority in the education sector. Think about how can education be done well when there is such a lack of talent? With such mediocrity, such perfunctory irresponsibility, seeing that there are more and more university graduates, but there has been no increase in useful talents.</p>
<p>A country is like a person. To study knowledge, one must build depth on top of breadth. Depth is university education, and breadth is elementary school education. Only on the basis of truly universal elementary and middle school education can a sound and solid university education be built. If one neglects this lower foundation and only pursues high-level knowledge, the result is bound to fail. Because this is by no means a magnificent building, but only a non-existent castle in the air. This is the lesson from before the war. We should make some changes now.</p>
<h3>Three Words and Two Phrases</h3>
<p>— Yu Jing</p>
<p>This little woman stopped her incessant chatter, put her hand on the light switch, and asked, "Dear, everything has been taken care of tonight, right?"</p>
<p>In the darkness, her husband patiently replied, "My dear, everything has been turned off except you."</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Receiving the Electricity Bill</h3>
<p>— Wu Derun</p>
<p>I received the power company's "User Bill," and the account section actually listed three items: the first item is electricity charges; the second is a fuel surcharge; and the third is a 10% public utility surcharge for the Municipal Government · Wu Derun. I casually calculated it: the electricity charge is 120 yuan per unit, but the fuel surcharge is an additional 205 yuan per unit. That's simply 162.5% of the electricity charge itself.</p>
<p>The fuel surcharge didn't start this month; moreover, we benefit from it not being "adjusted" monthly like the "cost of living index." However, this still doesn't resolve our confusion. First, what is the basis for the fuel surcharge? Why not include it in the electricity charge item for calculation? (Perhaps this is because public utilities cannot arbitrarily raise prices without the approval of the authorities, but we also suspect) What standard is used for calculating the surcharge? Has it been approved by the authorities?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I also discovered a few lines of red text on this month's bill. I didn't usually pay much attention to these "notes" or "explanations." Only the striking red color aroused my curiosity.</p>
<p>Original text: "This company is hereby ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs that any revised electricity prices or surcharges approved by the authorities, for which advance notice is not possible, are allowed to be collected retroactively. Therefore, this company reserves the right to increase charges for the amount of electricity included in this bill."</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn't help but feel surprised again. "Reserving the right to increase charges" seems to be an unprecedented innovation.</p>
<p>Electricity supply is a public utility and cannot be as profit-driven as ordinary for-profit businesses. Although everyone knows the facts of soaring fuel prices and huge expenses, "the name of the fuel surcharge may have been created for this reason, but perhaps no user will agree to this 'reservation of the right to increase charges.'"</p>
<h3>Arts and Culture Scene</h3>
<p>A monthly booklet of letters will be published in this city. The publication will purely print and compile letters from various writers, which is a unique approach and seems to have no precedent.</p>
<p>Novelist Tian Tao has recently completed a full-length novel titled "Beyond the Border," which depicts the characters and events of rural life.</p>
<p>Tian Han's hurriedly written "Lament for Jiangnan" will be directed by Ying Yunwei, starring Zhou Xuan and Zhao Dan.</p>

<h3>A Trilogy of Abandonment</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhou</p>
<p>Deng Shiping, manager of the Chinese musical troupe that will soon travel to New York to perform "Meng Jiangnu," was recently sued by his wife, Chu Jingru, on charges of assault and abandonment. This is originally a very ordinary abandonment case, not worth making a fuss about. One newspaper's headline was "Manager's Scandal," but in the various kinds of criminal cases, Deng Shiping's "change of heart" doesn't even count as a "scandal." A police training class leader raping a colleague's wife with a gun, that is a real scandal; Feng Lai posing as a husband and raping a fellow villager, Mrs. Zhang, that is a scandal. Moreover, it seems that some scandals come from famous families. Despite the tall buildings and magnificent exteriors, there are quite a few places to hide dirt and accept filth. Cases of human-demon relationships and incestuous cases can be cited as examples.</p>
<p>However, from the Deng Shiping's abandonment case, we can also see the tragedy of women in a male-dominated society. A few words Chu Jingru said in court are especially worth noting by other women. Below is a direct transcript from a certain newspaper:</p>
<p>"Chu Jingru told reporters that when Deng pursued her, he went from Zhejiang to Japan and then to the mainland. At that time, she knew that Deng had abandoned his previous actress, so she did not want to marry him. However, Deng was determined to die and attempted suicide five times. She also showed two photos, one of herself in her youth, standing gracefully, lively and charming, completely different from her current appearance. She told her that although her husband had six or seven new lovers, none of them could compare to her youthful beauty. Her words were filled with feelings about the past and present...</p>
<p>In a male-dominated society, what is a woman's only capital? — Youth. How many women are forced to sell their youth, and how many women, because their youth has passed, have lost their security and can only spend their days weeping. Shakespeare said: "Frailty, thy name is woman?" If women cannot liberate themselves from the process of "making a living by relying on youth," then gender equality will always be just a slogan, and all kinds of injuries, crimes, and abandonment crimes will likely increase day by day. In Bai Juyi's time, women in the marketplace already lamented "when a person ages, their pearl turns yellow," but today, how many women are still frequently worried about the passing of youth? This is sad. When Chu Jingru was "standing gracefully," Deng Shiping did not hesitate to commit suicide five times, and went from Zhejiang to Japan and then to the mainland, which can be said to be a "pursuit expert"; when they got married, Chu Jingru knew that the other party was unreliable, and asked him for security, he enthusiastically and generously gave her a pistol, saying: "I have nothing else, just a gun and a life. If I ever change my heart towards you in the future, you can shoot me dead." But how long had it been before Chu Jingru was no longer "standing gracefully," so Deng Shiping also canceled his promise - "the new lover has six or seven people" said.</p>
<p>There are many such stories in society. Even in the same day's newspaper, there is a news item about "Paint Store Owner Wang Xirong Raping and Abandoning the Famous Young Lady Shao Wenying," and it is also the same "trilogy": initially, "Wang saw Shao and was amazed by her beauty, so he thought of seducing her"; then, "Wang opened a room in the Kang Le Hotel, Shao knew something was wrong, wanted to leave, but Wang used force to hold her down"; the ending is "the woman sought refuge, Wang refused sharply, and she was repeatedly beaten and humiliated, her body and mind were shattered." Although the methods may be slightly different, the procedures are roughly the same for any abandonment case.</p>
<p>For the sake of women, it is necessary to think more about the future life and encounters when they are "standing gracefully."</p>

<h3>Lighted Sky Advertising</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>Santa Claus rides in a sleigh pulled by several reindeer, parading in the city's sky; both humans and animals are equipped with electric lights, which shine brightly in the dark night. This is a type of lighted sky advertising discovered over New York City in the United States last Christmas night, and it can represent the latest development in sky advertising. This type of advertising is towed by an airplane, but because it is at night, the airplane cannot be seen.</p>
<p>In the past, sky advertising towed by airplanes could only be seen during the day, and its shape looked like a mesh billboard with solid letters attached. To make this type of advertising visible at night, it must be designed completely differently. The creator of the aforementioned lighted sky advertising, S.S. Pike Company of New York, has recently fully published the manufacturing and deployment methods of the "Santa Claus Riding a Reindeer Sleigh" lighted advertisement. A brief description is provided below:</p>
<p>This Christmas advertisement is towed by a 400-foot-long rope. The advertisement itself is 150 feet long and 15 feet high, and it is equipped with one thousand electric lights, using the electricity generated by the airplane's generator to supply the required current. The electrical wires are numerous and complicated; if straightened into a single line, they would be 3,000 feet long.</p>
<p>The first step in making this type of advertisement is to use fabric to make a net of the required size, and install crossbars at certain intervals to support the framework. Then, spread the net flat on the ground and attach the canvas silhouettes of the sleigh and figures. Then, attach light sockets to these canvas strips, one socket approximately every foot, and connect them with electrical wires. Although the lights used are no larger than flashlight bulbs, their light output is very strong. One person must spend hours of hard work to install these more than a thousand small light bulbs in their sockets. The main cable is tied to the tow rope with a narrow band. Before deployment, the voltmeter must be used to test all parts of the connected wiring from the advertisement to the electrical terminal below the aircraft to ensure that there are no</p>
<p>Now the lighted advertisement is complete. Next, we will talk about the deployment method. Based on the experience of deploying daytime sky advertisements, the same method can also be used to deploy lighted sky advertisements. The standard deployment method is to place the advertisement flat on the airfield, and then lead the tow rope backward and then forward to the aircraft in a large U-shape. When the aircraft takes off, it first lifts the loose part of the U, and then "peels" the advertisement off the ground. To ensure that the lighted advertisement is not damaged, its creator uses a group of personnel to hold the advertisement upright so that the aircraft can pull it away. In order to keep the lighted advertisement stable and upright in the air, a streamlined weight is attached under the triangular fabric of the advertisement, several pieces of cloth are sewn on the appropriate parts of the advertisement, and an air drag net is attached to the tail. When the aircraft is about to land, the advertisement is released first, so that it can slowly sink to the ground.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Famous Songs</h3>
<p>— Ke Di</p>
<p>Here, I will introduce two famous operas by Puccini (Puccini): "Madama Butterfly."</p>
<p>One Fine Day (Un bel di vedremo)</p>
<p>This beautiful aria has a deeply charming melody, full of hope and fantasy of love. It is sung by the heroine, Madame Butterfly, at the beginning of the second act. Although her husband—an American officer named Pinkerton—has left her for three years, she always hopes that he will return. She lives with her son and a faithful maid (Suzuki) in a small house, leading a carefree life. The maid has begun to doubt whether her husband will really return. Although Madame Butterfly tries her best to remain calm and wait, there is always a surge of worry and fear in her heart. In this moving aria, she imagines a large ship bringing her husband back from faraway America, so that they can live a happy and fulfilling life together again. Diana writes that Ping once sang in "First Love."</p>
<p>Duet of the Flowers</p>
<p>This female duet (soprano and mezzo-soprano) is also sung in the second act. The poor Madame Butterfly finally sees her husband's ship entering the harbor. She firmly believes that her husband will return to her side, so she instructs the maid to decorate the room with flowers in preparation for his arrival. The maid picks all the flowers in the garden. As they decorate the room, they sing this exciting and lively duet.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Bang Shouou</p>
<p>"Everyone, I have something I want to discuss with you!" Old Zhu, who is taller than anyone else, stood in the center of the circle of people like a bamboo pole, with a strange and unnatural smile on his face, and said to everyone: "I have been to the highway checkpoint twice, and I have also been to the town. There are absolutely no empty cars, and there are no rides available to take us for the time being. Now there is only one car from the Trade Commission that is already full of people and goods, and they have agreed to take two of us. I originally didn't want to agree to this scattered way of leaving. However, it's my fault for bringing two friends, Mrs. Hu and her daughter, from the woods in the first place. But now, Hu Benben is so seriously ill. As a last resort, I would like to ask Lao Zhang to accompany them to leave first, so that she can quickly enter the county hospital in Hechi. This matter..."</p>
<p>"No problem! No problem," many people immediately shouted in unison. "People who are sick should leave first!"</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian is now really smiling, but at the same time, he also made a great effort to prevent his tears from flowing.</p>
<p>So he separated the crowd and quietly walked closer to Lan's head.</p>
<p>"Thank you, I heard everything!" Before he could speak, Lan had already spoken in a weak voice. Her face was a little dark, and her lips were as red as a cockscomb. Old Zhu's strange gaze kept moving back and forth across her face. He really wanted to gently touch it, but finally restrained himself. "Everything is up to you."</p>
<p>Lan, who usually doesn't like to talk, is even less willing to waste unnecessary words now.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's very good." Old Zhu replied softly, his voice sounding strange even to his own ears. "I will immediately pack the things you need in your small leather suitcase, and we will still take the rest with us. But, Feifei... does Feifei want to go with you?"</p>
<p>Fei nodded slightly.</p>
<h3>A Comedy of Errors</h3>
<p>— Gu Jiafeng</p>
<p>A poor painter had owed rent for many days, and the landlord had to come and urge him.</p>
<p>The painter said: "Please be patient for a little longer, in the future people will come here to visit and say: 'Look! This is where that famous painter used to work.'"</p>
<p>The landlord sneered: "Really? If you don't pay me today, they can say that tomorrow morning."</p>
