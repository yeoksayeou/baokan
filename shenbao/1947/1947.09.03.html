<h3>豫皖鄂邊山區激戰　國軍收復商城宋埠　今後軍事重心將在東北</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕國防部長白崇禧，二日出席政務會議，報告軍事，略稱：目前若干人士對豫鄂邊境戰事極為關懷，其實匪軍劉伯誠部雖流竄甚猛，但不如外傳之甚，戰局將來將決定於東北，在魯中，豫　鄂一帶戰事告一段落後，即將移軍北上，白部長報告時，對戰局極有信心。</p>

<h3>東北行轅高懸國旗　陳兼主任昨視事　當晚在瀋召集將領會議</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽二日電〕東北行轅門前，二日高懸國旗，十時陳兼主任率楚溪春·車蕃如等至行轅，鄭副主任洞國等武官列隊門首迎，陳氏於樂聲中進入行轅，登樓後，熊式輝迎於辦公室外，入室略行交接，旋至禮堂，軍事人員，各省市主席，市長等文武官員，鵠候聆訓。</p>
<p>熊·陳登台，熊氏首先致詞稱：二年來蒙杜長官·張嘉璈先生·地方元老·文武民員等協力，提有今日。東北前淪陷，非僅東北恥，亦為中國恥，今天東北成為半淪陷狀態，實為東北及中國之禍患。本人決不能忘却東北整個的收復，將來直接間接要帮助完成此任務。現陳總長來兼行轅主任，對於東北整個收復及安定，更能加强，同時亦為中央重視東北一大明證。本人十年完成之事，陳氏可於一年內完成，事事可收事半功倍之效，最後祝諸位工作勝利，陳兼主任成功。</p>
<p>陳氏繼之致詞稱：熊主任再三請辭，中央派本人兼任，本人等決繼續熊氏來完成工作，同時，我們亦不能忘記熊主任接收東北之初及兩年來所遭苦難，共同奮勉。東北問題係整個國家及國際安全問題，大家要努力，不但有此需要，同時亦有其努力價値，詞舉攝就職影，並送熊氏出行轅，旋即開始辦公，首召鄭洞國及正副參謀長有所詢問與指示，繼批閱公文，接見行政人員，過午始離行轅。東北元老張作相·王樹翰等，以政委會委員身份出席陳之就職禮，陳對之優禮有加。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽二日電〕二日下午六時，各界舉行送熊迎陳酒會，陳與參加人士握手含笑，注意傾只介紹，對記者所提問題，謂僅能交白卷，熊稱日內即飛平。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽二日電〕陳總長兼主東北軍政，使沉閟之東北大局已見開朗，日來軍方忙於籌措，顯示　局將急轉直下。一般預測，國軍即將主動郵擊，可能即肅淸遼南及安東梅河口一帶匪踪，然後向北進展，收復松北。昨晚陳氏在行轅第二招待所召集此間將領會議，深夜始散。又北寗路上動輸頻繁，均為國軍反擊之準備。</p>
<h3>陳兼主任發表　告東北軍民書</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽二日電〕陳兼主任誠，二日就職後，即發表告東北軍民書，其中陳述兩點，以資共勉，陳氏首述中央為貫澈抗戰建國初衷，解除人民痛苦，萬不得已而下令動員全國，以加緊戡亂平逆，故今後行轅之首要任務，即在執行政府剿匪國策。次述宜及時去奢崇儉，力挽頽風，至於軍隊紀律，尤當澈底整飭，如有違法苛擾，定心嚴予懲處。同時，吾人更宜各就崗位，各衋職守，於艱難困苦之中，尋求自力更生之道。</p>

<h3>大連港開放問題　傳蘇拒絕美抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕據素來靈通人士談稱，關於美國對蘇聯拒不開放大連港，流通國際商務一事所提出之抗義，頃悉蘇聯已加以拒絕。</p>
<p>消息靈通人士並未透露蘇加以拒絕之理由，僅謂：美國官員已接獲通知，謂蘇聯仍不願被迫以大連交還中國接管，並在簽訂對日和約之前，不願將其開放國際商港。美國就大連問題所提出之最近抗議，係於八月十四日送達蘇聯外交部，本年一月三日亦曾提出一次抗議，美國在八月十四日之抗議中曾謂：「大連根據一九四五年八月之中蘇條約，應闢為國際自由商港」，吾人今認為實無理由再遲遲不將其開放，蓋該項條約僅規定在戰時蘇聯有軍事控制該港之權故也。今美國認為戰事已結束二年，但蘇聯則力言在未簽訂對日和約之前，戰事尚不能謂為結束。</p>
<p>美國官員除對蘇聯佔領大連一事，加以抗議外，並亦認為中蘇條約之條件，文字實未見分明，內容雖規定戰事結束後大連須交還中國行政當局接管，但亦規定中國須承認蘇聯在大連利益之「最大權」，致於日本向中國投降之二年，今尚未交還中國。</p>
<p>官方人士加以評曰，蘇聯所持之立塲，乃謂大連問題純係有關中蘇二國之事件，但美國鑒於大連對於美國及世界之利益，故仍主張將以開放為商港。官方今對蘇聯之立塲，尚在加以研究中。關於所將採取之步驟，則尚未作最後決定，按最近一年來美蘇二國對大連事件已屢起爭執，蘇聯本曾允許美國班船駛至大連靠岸，以郵件及供應物品接濟該地之美國領事，但在本年三月間，即遭禁止，不獲再駛入該港。上述供應物品現皆改由蘇聯船隻運交該地美國總領事。</p>
<h3>唐縱胡伯翰飛藩</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕唐縱在平公畢，今與華北防空副司令胡伯翰袂飛瀋。</p>
<h3>吉北國軍兩路　自烏拉街出擊</h3>
<p>〔中央社吉林二日電〕吉北地區國軍，頃自烏拉街分北東兩路向前挺進，北路已肅淸烏拉街北六十華里之三家子，堅强控制溪浪河，白旗屯（均在三家子北）等地，舒蘭共匪已受威脅。東路已克紅窰，其外圍據戰均歸國軍掌握，吉西國軍，業將岔路河外圍肅淸，主力一部刻進出於伊勒門站一帶。</p>
<h3>鄂境公商汽車　實施軍事管制</h3>
<p>九三紀念會停止舉行</p>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕行轅頃宣布：對鄂境公商汽車實施軍事管制，必要時將予以徵用。同時，並令飭九三勝利紀念大會停止舉行，以防奸宄活動。</p>
<h3>我償債錫銻鎢鑛產　美列為國略儲備品</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕中國錫·銻·鎢三種鑛產，現已列為美國軍略儲備品。財政部聯邦供應局及陸海軍軍械局，正自世界各地吸收此種特質。現在存貨及自何國收購，則關軍事秘密，並無所知，惟聞中國為輸出國之一。此種軍略性原料現由中國用以淸償其一部份對美債務。進出口銀行對華放款總額七千萬美元，規定將來由中國以金屬償還，因之稱為「金屬借款」。借款協定係於一九四〇年訂立，於明年滿期。據該行表示，中國頗能履約。中國方面所傳中國鎢產因蘇聯以現金抬價收購，正全部運往蘇聯，此間認為不確。據建設金融公司金屬儲備局宣布：「今年以來，並無中國鎢運到，吾人亦不需此。美國存鎢並不缺乏，故僅自中國收購與銻而已」。美國政府存鎢數量，各機關均不洩露，其他方面則信正有相當數量之鎢運往蘇聯。據戰時駐華某退職官員稱：「一九三八年至一九三九年間，中國政府曾與蘇聯締結物物交換協定，中國自蘇聯獲得軍火，中國則以金屬供給蘇聯。此項協定詳細內容迄未公布，但蘇聯由此協定獲得中國所產金屬之一大部份，殆無疑議」。</p>
<h3>在韓工作完成　魏使今飛東京　臨別贈言盼韓國黨派團結一致</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城二日電〕魏德邁將軍定三日飛東京，五日飛夏威夷，魏氏在其留韓最後一日中，告朝鮮臨時議會之特別會稱：「朝鮮國內外人士與黨派之團結，將使朝鮮强盛與統一之目的，迅速實現，貴國人民之未來幸福康樂，將受君等深謀遠慮及君等之行動極大影響」。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處漢城一日電〕魏德邁將軍昨日訪問釜山，在該處聽取朝鮮人（約一百五十名）提出關於政治與經濟問題各種不同之意見。魏使團其他園員是日分作三組，從事於視察工廠與釜山之港口設備，並向不少朝鮮官員，農民及小商人，作個別之調查。本日此項調查工作在漢城內及四周繼續進行，由魏德邁將軍領導，聽取美韓官員及個別訪客之意見。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕此間二日起正式宣布戒嚴，除持有特別通行證者外，夜間均不得通行，但一般皆信，劉匪流竄必遭嚴重打擊，故人心鎭靜，市塲亦無大波動。</p>
<h3>蒙軍圖進犯　北塔山主峯</h3>
<p>〔中央社北塔山一日電〕外蒙軍連日增兵北塔山，企圖由其主力向大小松樹漸移動一節，已極明顯，蓋欲乘隙進攻北塔山之主峯阿爾特腦巴也。該峯高一八四五公尺，在我軍陳地胡居爾特之在翼，居高臨下，形勢扼要。半月來，該峯早為白雪所掩蓋，氣溫在五六度之間，轉瞬冰凍，大雪封山，則非用兵之地，故蒙軍之企圖早在我軍意料中。</p>

<h3>國人在外外匯資產　應自動申報登記　財部擬定條例即提全經會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南南京二日電〕關於國人在外外匯資產申報登記條例，財部已有具體決定，即可提全經會討論，條例內容主要為國人應將其在外外匯資產自動申報，並過賬入中央銀行，此事並非表示對在外外匯資產將予凍結，如有醫藥旅行等需要，仍可動用，不申報者將予嚴辦。又據權威人士透露消息，魏德邁所稱國人在美資產有十五億之說，係指「資產」而言，我在美僑胞旣如此衆多，十五億資產當不為多。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕關於澈查六中全會決議動用國人在外存款案執行情形事，監院前曾決議有案，近並指派監委多人，分赴財部等有關機關澈查，不久當可分曉。</p>

<p>〔本報北平二日電〕軍事當局決擴大北平警備司令部為北平警備總司令部。外傳將成立平津衛戍總部說不確。此擴大後之機構，轄區包括平津路，天津及塘沽，將直隸國防部，而暫授權北平行轅或保定綏署就近指揮。總司令仍由陳繼承担任，保定綏署天津指揮所決定撤銷。北平指揮所是否撤銷尚未定。某觀察家指陳，北平警備總部轄區東伸至塘沽後，華北心臟北平出海之路，即可因指導之一元化而益鞏固。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>勝利兩年的感想　—兼答大美晚報的欵問—</h3>
<p>兩年前的今天，前日本軍大本營參謀總長梅津與日本政府的代表重光葵，在東京灣美國主力艦『密蘇里』號的甲板上，正式簽訂日本對盟國的降約，成爲人類歷史上最重要的一個轉捩點。從那天日本正式簽降起，在人類歷史上結束了一次慘酷的戰爭，應該展開一張光明燦爛的新頁。可是我們在兩年之後的今天，遇到這個時代的紀念日，竟連『强顏爲歡』，似乎沒有這種雅興。</p>
<p>這究竟爲了什麽？一半是我們自己不爭氣：一半是事過境遜，戰時曾共患難的朋友似乎到現在述敵友都模糊起來了。以致昔日的敵人倒反洋洋自得，躍躍欲試；而當年的盟友却相互譏詆，或竟分道揚鑣！</p>
<p>記得去年今日，戰敗的日本雖已掙扎復與，但在盟國管制之下，尙無翻身再起之望。麥克阿瑟元帥那天發表文告，曾謂『因有害思想的侵蝕，致使全世界爲疑懼不安之陰影所籠罩；如聽任此種思想蔓延。而不加限制，則個人自由將爲之蕩然無存。日本今後在世界上所處的地位，將爲和平之堡壘呢？抑將變爲戰爭之跳板呢？』可見麥帥當時對於日本的將來，尙抱懷疑態度，但至今年今日，日本的一切，似已大爲改觀：不僅在日本人民的意識上，幾已不復承認自己是一個戰敗國，卽對於日本代表在美艦簽訂降書的一幕，也恐早已淡忘，而認美國爲她的救星了！對日和約今雖迄未成立，但日本私人對外貿易已於八月十五日重行開放；賠償問題似更束諸高閣。無怪乎日本人得意忘形，侵略野心暗中又圖死灰復燃。據外國通訊社的報道，日本擬向未來的對日和會提出三項要求，（一）與美國共同託管硫球羣島國（二）取得台灣的特別移民權；（三）取得在庫頁島與千島列島的捕漁權。單以此事而論，日本人氣燄的囂張，已可不言而喩。</p>
<p>戰敗的日本，怎樣在短短的兩年內就會狂妄至此？一方面固由於麥帥及共僚屬不免受了日本人狐媚政策的蒙蔽，做了『可欺以其方』的君子，以爲這個當年的東方敵人未始不可以做一個恭順的奴僕，而不復考慮其過度寬容的後果，但在另一方面，我們却不能不痛切自責，爲什麽大好兩年的光陰，竟使中國虛擲於「和談」與戰亂交織而成的紛擾之中？同時，我們又爲什麽不從早就整飭吏治和戡平叛亂兩點，雙管齊下，努力前進，以奠定一個和平統一而又强大的新中國的基礎，致令見譏於友邦，貽笑於敵人？據路透社東京電，美國當局擬將美日匯率規定爲一元對一三〇圓：以此計算，戰前不及我國法幣一元的日圓，而現在竟値我國法幣三百元了。戰勝國的貨幣不及戰敗國的値錢，豈非天下的怪事？這眞値得我們自號勝利者的痛切反省！</p>
<p>然而，今天的世界，無論和平與戰爭，顯然是不可分割隔離的了。故日本投降以後兩年情狀的演變，在速東，－特別在中國，一切情狀的演變，我們固當由痛切自責，進而至於積極自救，但亦不容許任何人漠視了中國所受國際局勢逆轉的外來的惡劣影響。本報前天社論『美國對華究將如何？』昨天大美晚報發表社諭，反問一句『中國究將如何自助？』我們的美國同業說：祗要中國能確實做些自助之事，美國就樂於履行她的一部份。大美晚報且明白指出：『美國的工作不能是初步的，而在適當的中國自助作爲後盾之下，也許終於是一種決定性的工作。』我們十分歡迎盟友這種坦白爽直的表示，並且敢說，中國是決定先向『自助』的大道上走的。我們要把握勝利的果實，我們人民一定要　其可能以肅消一切貪汚份子，我們也一定督促政府努力於種種的改革，以加强政治與經濟，一切設施的行政效率。這是中國人自助所必由之路。縱無朋友的忠吿，中國人民亦必努力以赴。惟是，我們同時須得提醒美國盟友兩段重要的話：</p>
<p>（一）中國今日局勢之造成，八年久戰和戰後中共的叛亂是其總因，而有意援助中共叛亂者爲蘇聯，無形中延遲了政府的剿共政策，而等於放縱中共坐大者爲美國舉棋不定的對華政策。而蘇聯與美國均是戰時中國的盟友：她們倆目前却又正互相鈎心鬥角！</p>
<p>（二）中國固須自救自助，但在大戰之後，正如英國一樣，同時確亦希望摯友的援助。譬諸醫藥治療，最貴及時：否則縱然有效，亦將事倍功半。抗日戰爭爆發以前。國民政府何以有驚人的進步？應該想到李滋羅斯當年來華，助我建立法幣政策，遂使國家建設猛進，抗戰力量亦得養成。今則戰後元氣大傷，幣値亟須穩定，必待經濟鞏固，一切政治方可走上軌道。美國盟友果眞有意援華，當從病根注意，時機之迫稍縱即逝，萬不容再事徘徊觀望的了。</p>
<p>千言萬語，美國在東方要尋朋友，究竟去找兩年以前的敵人——日本呢？還是找八年苦戰，患難與共的友邦——中國呢？我們敢說，日本今天固或貌似一個『忠僕』，但將來未必不是一個叛主的悍僕罷。因爲日本人民如果不受長久的『再敎育」，他們還是夢想有一天做世界的主人而不甘永爲臣僕的。只有中國，才始終決心與盟邦站在平等地位做着言而有信的忠實朋友，旣沒有野心作世界的主人，也不願卑躬屈膝表面上做成『臣僕」一般，以討朋友　歡心！</p>

<h3>泛美洲會議圓滿結束　杜魯門致閉幕辭　力言侵略威脅依然存在　並保證以金元武力維護世界和平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二日廣播：杜魯門在泛美洲會議中致閉幕辭稱：歐洲與亞洲多數國家現正處於武力侵略之威脅下，並保證美國將以武力及金元全力維護世界和平。美國對戰後局面大感失望，示得不作長期佔領敵國領土之準備。今有多數國家仍受外國勢力之支配。杜魯門雖未直接指明蘇聯在中歐及南歐之外交政策，但其辭鋒對誰而發，殆無疑義。杜氏稱：「余不信目前之國際紛爭非藉武力不能解決，吾人將竭力避免足以增加國際緊張局勢之事物。吾人將繼續努力以維持永久和平，吾人決心保特實力。吾人避免使用武力，不得曲解爲缺乏遵守聯合國憲章義務之決心，或縱容他人隨意破壞國際和平之基礎。吾人決心保持軍事實力，正足以證明吾人對本身義務之認眞態度。美國決盡力給予有意自助之各國以經濟上之援助。但美國之經濟資源決非取之無窮用之不竭者，故特籲請新大陸其他國家共同援助舊大陸各國。歐亞各國之受戰爭洗禮者，應有獲得經濟援助之優先權」。杜魯門指出世界列强未能對戰敗國和約意見一致，因此吾人不得不考慮延長在敵國境內之軍事佔領期間。杜氏一再保證美國將加強聯合國機構，使成爲更有效之世界和平機構。同時宣稱：「聯合國今已遭遇壓力，美國之任務爲維護和平，而非製造和平」云。</p>

<h3>波茨坦協定原則　與對日和會無關　美國務院研究蘇新照會</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓一日合衆電〕美國務院官員稱：國務院現正研究昨日蘇聯予美之新照會，蘇聯在照會中，仍拒絕接受美國召開十一國對日和會之建議，並重申過去之立塲，主張召開和會及草擬和約之事，應操於外長會議手中，一如草擬歐洲和約時應爲者。</p>
<p>美官員又稱：國務院各官員在硏究蘇聯之新照會，欲在其中尋覓足以調和美蘇歧見之任何「可能」，預料至本週杪，或可採取一步驟。自蘇聯之照會觀之，蘇聯認爲召開十一國和會（由遠東委員會之會員國組成）乃違反波茨坦協定者，但波茨坦會議時，蘇聯尙未與日本作戰，而對日作戰主要國家之一之中國，則未參加波茨坦會議。故波茨坦會議之決定，僅適用於歐洲和會，至於對白和約，則完全爲另一問題，倘波茨坦所規定之程序適用於對日和約之擬訂，則列强之間必須查關於對日問題之另一新協定，但事實上此　協定固未存在也。</p>

<h3>日本投降兩週年　麥帥盛譽日本復興成乙　主張對日和約應力求寬大公正</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京二日電〕本日爲盟國戰勝日本兩週年紀念日，麥帥特發表紀念感言，略謂：日本簽訂降書以來，稱屆兩載。在此一年之間，日本尙能忠實履行誓約，盟國在日本之軍事佔領，着重於道義價値，誠爲史無先例，不以武力而以正議爲一切之基準。</p>
<p>對日和約已決定最近在預備會議上予以討論，在此會議中，吾人採取寬大公正之態度，殊爲必要。再日本自投降以來，由盟軍之指導與美國之援助，逐漸恢復其潰滅之經濟，工業生產現已達到戰前標準百分之四十五以上，其上昇傾向，今後亦可能繼續惟欲使日本將來成爲自立國家，則聯合國修正對日貿易方式，使日本免陷經濟孤立，實有絕對必要。若和約簽訂後之日本，在國際上能與他國同樣立於自由與和平之基礎上，並予以生存之機會，則現在日本業已萌芽之民主主義之現在日本業已萌芽之民主主義之政治方式，必不至於威脅世界，並將使日本人民獲得正常之和平生活）。</p>

<h3>謀殺余盛孝案　美軍法庭開審　五證人陳述對馬萊不利　我有關各機關派員觀審被告御軍服到案聲稱無罪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動一時之余盛孝謀殺案，其嫌疑犯美人馬萊伍長，由美軍顧間團於昨晨九時假美軍英靈保管處三樓組織軍事法庭，予以審判。法庭由美軍官十一人組成，由帕爾謨上校任主席，其餘之法斷爲史坦尼上校，甲可勃上校，勞遜中校，威脫中校，蕭中校，吐倫脫少校，史密斯少校，李特少校，愛格斯少校，鮑斯威爾上尉等。檢察官爲奧爾尼上尉。被吿辯護人有四：一爲平民身份之波勒金，及史托波女士。此外二人爲愛遜少校及派屈立克上尉。我國有關人士蒞臨觀審者有法院庭長査庭柯，推事朱育璜，檢察官丁國竣，曹鴻，外交部辦事處主任陳國廉，科長何性仁，謝志堅，政院新聞局辦事處主任魏景蒙，及市政府參事等。被吿馬萊仍御軍服，由辯護人陪同坐於庭右，却利則由我國法警於上午送到候審。死者余盛孝之妻陸氏携子女於上午抵達。中外證人共十三名到庭應詢。</p>
<p>法庭因光綫較暗，白畫電炬猶明。十一軍事法官外向而坐，後縣美國軍旗，法庭內外由憲兵警衛，肅靜無譯，氣象森嚴。九時正檢察官宣佈案由，全體法官宣誓入席。檢察官首問馬萊是否罪犯，馬當即起立聲言無罪。於是即傳詢第一證人麥克倫少校。麥舉手宣誓後，即表示血案發生之前，馬萊告以身無分文，特來滬領薪，但星期六抵出納科時，表示已有九十美無左右。傳訽之第二名證人中正艾路新麗珠酒吧主人育諾威資。渠謂八月一日，馬來曾於午後時及三時兩度至新麗珠。此時被告辯護　人波勒金力加質　詢，保修以種種方漢使證人民敢禾定確於八月一日見過馬來，以便脫云馬之罪嫌。但證人雖對時間一點不能作最凖確之指出，而於見面一節，則一口咬定。並謂似曾見馬萊及卻利同入酒吧，但因印象不深，不敢斷定。</p>
<p>馬萊及辯護律師起立答辯（本報攝）</p>
<h3>車主蒲洛夫證明　馬萊與卻利同車</h3>
<p>育諾威資退後，即傳詢第三證人俄人汽車主人蒲洛夫。蒲洛夫謂認識却利已有兩年，八月一日上午十時却利單獨前來商借汽車，至午後四時半至匯中飯店附近駕車而去，謂與友同行，不用原有之司機。至當晚八時十分返抵匯中，當由却利付款八十萬元，作爲酬金。並要求蒲洛夫先送其友人至百老匯大厦、然後再送其本人返家。當時尙未發現車子有何共點，後兩日方發覽車上有已乾之血跡，乃急報吿警局。至是法官乃詢以是否能指出所載之却利之友人，蒲洛夫云「當然」，遝手指被吿席上之馬萊。詢問完畢，已逾十二時半，遂由法庭宣佈休息，至午後一時半重開。</p>
<p>研究　地圖</p>
<p>午後準時重行開庭，因天氣悶熱，詢問時間冗長，旁聽席上人數銳减，出席者亦稱之爲「疲勞審判」。第四名證人爲美于軍軍士羅斯，渠爲案發後至出事地點繪製地圖者。此時應法官之召，即在地圖前說明繪製方法，法官檢察官及被吿辯護人亦趨前同加硏究，認爲滿意，羅斯遂退。至二時零五分，傳詢最重要之證人却利，全庭精神爲之一振。却利衣綠衫藍褲，岸然而入，面部表情呆滯。旣入證人席，檢察官以莊重之口吻，囑其舉手宣誓，隨即開始兩小時又半之冗長詢問。</p>
<p>卻利　受讀</p>
<p>却利態度尙鎭靜，有順必答，但答覆　慢，而吐音絕低。略謂過去與馬萊之相識，完全爲普通社交性質，並無業務關係，在八月一日之前，曾與馬萊晤面三次。至於余盛孝，則八月一日上午九時半曾見面，當時託其將美金八十六元易成法幣，至十一時三刻，復與余晤面交付法幣。繼即詢及八月一日之凶案，檢察官提出重要物證却利之呢帽一頂，蓋是日與余盛孝乘車外出時，馬萊着平民服裝，曾借用却利之帽。却利當庭承認呢帽爲其所有，馬萊下午向其借用，至晚間七時二十分時歸還。此時被吿之辯護人檢視此呢帽，亦默然無言。</p>
<p>余盛孝之遣屬（本報攝）</p>
<p>勿殺我　勿殺我</p>
<p>至是檢察官遂詳詢血案發生時情景却利一一答覆，與我國法院所供者略同。據稱，渠駕車坐於前座，馬萊及余盛孝於坐於一後座，中途忽聞槍聲一響，繼聞余氏呼曰：「勿殺我，勿殺我！我將一切予汝可也！」但馬萊卒將余槍殺後推之下車，並令却利陳返原路入市。此時法官及檢察官等並在地圖之前，詳細核對，檢察官並以路面及兩旁樹木情形，反覆詢問，以求印證。至四時二十分，詢問完畢，帕爾謨上校宣布休　·而於今晨九時續審。</p>
<p>今續詢·證人八名</p>
<p>今晨開庭後，尙有證人八名將嚴繼續傳詢，然後舉行終結辯論。會寗將至是宣吿閉庭。由法官舉行秘密投票，以判決被吿人有罪政無罪，如屬無罪，則當衆宣吿其無事，如屬有罪，則當詢問被吿人之履歷及已往犯罪情形再考慮及決定刑罰再行開庭宣佈，或暫守秘密，以待上級機關公佈。</p>

<h3>艾北新炭都　新　名聲不及撫順大　希望比撫順多</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽八月廿八日航訊本報記者趙展</p>
<p>資委會副委員長孫越崎先生，偕工礦專家數人；於入月廿六日抵早新煤礦視察，記者亦隨同出發。到達了熱河的東部邊緣。北地秋爽，風雨無定，阜新的環境正像天氣一樣，在不安定中求生產，將近兩年來已經歷了數度風險。</p>
<p>阜新是新礦，它的名氣遠不如撫順大，他的希望却比撫順大得多。撫順幾乎到「　老山空」的境地了，據說還可以「返老還童」，但所化成本之鉅，在今天的局面下，只是力不從心。阜新則不然，它是一棵幼苗，正在茁壯成長。四平大戰之後，東北各煤礦都蒙受鉅大損失，事實上阜新已經成爲東北的新炭都。</p>
<p>日本侵略戰爭的後期，因石油萬分缺乏，硏究以阜新煤煉油成功，在綿西設立煉油工廠，預計月產石油三萬噸，惜乎裝置未全部竣工，日本已經屈膝請降。據　新留用的一位日籍地質學專家說：「錦西已經提煉石油，事關軍事秘密，所以生產數目不詳。」日本在九一八後，才積極開發這個寳庫。</p>
<p>阜新　層的生成時代為侏羅紀，煤質爲上乘，唯一的缺點是不能煉焦，其儲藏量較撫順開　爲多，據日人估計爲十二億四千萬噸，另有一說在卅億噸以上，但未能鑽探確定。因該煤因生咸呈繼　續情况，故有阜新·彰武·八道壕三煤田之分。車新最大，目前開採者僅阜新及八道壕北區一部份，彰武煤油尙未開發。</p>
<p>阜新共有六個礦廠，計爲新邱·高德·太平·孫家灣·五龍·平安·我們在十二小時之內參觀了新邱·太平·孫家灣三廠及選煤廠，總機廠。孫家灣的</p>
<p>天開採日產一千五百噸，新邱露天開採正在剝土。六礦共有斜井三十八個，我們以兩個小時參觀太平一分廠的一斜井。由兩位靑年的工程師作　導，我們深入地下四百公尺，探視地下實藏及生活在地層中的勞工。我們每個人都換上下礦的新裝，灰布衣袴，膠底鞋，手裏拿斯蒂克，頭愈柳條編織的「鋼盔」，上面裝有電石燈，十幾烟人的隊伍好像一條火龍，一步十步的魚貫而下，我和一位引導的工程師走在最前面，進人一百公尺之下，坑木支柱就沒有了，僅在最險的地方支架幾根支柱，我的心裏忐忑不安，便問道：「這不有危險嗎？」工程師很坦然的答道：「危險是危險，坑木缺乏，沒有辦法，我們十分小心，接收下來，還沒有發生一件不幸的事。」他的話使我安心了，進入礦山，我相信工程師的話就是力量，大槪第一個進入礦山的人都會提心吊胆的。</p>
<p>我們所到的是</p>
<p>四百公尺下的一角，底下還有兩百公尺。看見工人正運用電鑽和炸藥向礦山進攻，我欽佩他們是最　大的人類。這種採用小包工制，工人支付一分勞力，獲得一分報酬。但包工並不是合理的制度，工人很可能受到疾病的戚脅。礦上解答這一個疑問說：「工人短期生病，工資照平時所得標準支付，生病在一月以上者，支付工資三分之二。」據說工人可以事受死亡撫卹，公基金職工互助壽險及資委會保險事務所的四種保障，設若一個工人不幸死亡，他的家屬五年生活費用不成問題。在目前的社會環境及工作管理之下，只有。</p>
<p>小包工制是維持工作效率的最好制度，如不倡導一分利一分錢，維持工作效率是不可能的。工人的知識水準很低，百分之八十的工人不識字，他們平均每天可以拿一千二百元左右，高粱米賣到三百元一斤，生活非常苦。他們大部份是山東人，河北人，十年或廿年離開苦難的家鄕，到「新大陸」來的。</p>
<p>治安確保了，才能談到生產，卑新煤礦的職工都有如此感覺，他們受到共匪的威脅，在阜新北二十里便有小股共匪活動。因此大批的重要般器材存在漢陽錦一州，等治安無問題的時候才敢運來。職員的眷屬住在天津。孫越崎先生說：「這是耗予的辦法，一方面要吃東西，一方面要提防猶」。其次資金窘拙，電力及木材，糧食缺乏，都是使生產萎縮的重要因素。</p>
<p>阜新的煤礦，從卅五年一且，接收，經過一年餘的整頓，已恢復原來產量三分之一。</p>

<h3>樹柴當武器　大成殿儼如戰壘　鄭學生互毆事態嚴重</h3>
<p>〔本報鄭州廿九日訊〕此間敎師節日，縣師學生與安陽逃鄭學生，因爭大成殿而發生互毆的糾紛，昨今兩日，經調解無效，復起衝突，安陽學生一人被毆傷，同時事態的發展，有趨複雜化之勢。安陽逃鄭學生，廿八晚又回到大成殿去留宿的時候，不料大成殿的大門已經落了鎖，這樣又和縣師學生爭吵了起來，雙方毆打了一陣，其中有個留宿在鄭縣職工學校的安陽學生王德榮，也曾參加其役，結果被打傷了腿。大成殿的大門自然也被打開，當晚安陽學生還宿在裏面。可是這個夜裏有個出來小便的安陽學生王紹曾也被打傷了腿，但傷勢不重，另有出來小便的一個安陽學生王紹賢，幸虧跑丟了鞋子，沒被挨打。他們就此結了仇，廿九日安陽一些學生去　學校裏的樹枝當柴燒，因此又衝突起來。時問是在下午四點鐘起，縣師學生拿着童子軍棍當武器，佔着前院。安陽學生拿着樹枝木柴當武器，以大成殿爲根據地。縣師學生進去不得，安陽學生也出來不得，雙方各兩百餘人嚴陣相對，警察局長宋增運，縣畏高暗崙，安陽參議會會長田畊歷，以及還有幾位校長敎員們，原去調解，不知怎的，調解的人互相話不投機，一個說的：「算我們鄭州的不是，把客人得罪了，」一個說的：「算我們不是，被共匪趕到鄭州來了。」後來雙方的話，越說越難聽，調解人竟也贊了當事人。可是事情還好，沒有打起來，因爲縣長下了命令呌縣師的師生完全退出。這時候已經是七點多。不過現在雙方都在舉行會議，似乎都有進一步的舉動，還聽說上次率領安陽學生動武的梁姓敎員，已經被押起來了，這是在廿九日發生事件之前的事。</p>

<h3>讀者咨詢　法筆釋疑　舊式婚姻的糾紛</h3>
<p>〔徐能問〕表弟某甲，年二十二歲。二年前，由父母作主，與乙女訂婚，當時雖表不滿，但迫於經濟能力及環境，亦未極力反對，今某甲去年在滬，求學時認識丙女，二人一見鍾情，互誓白首。現已實行同居，丙女屢催某甲結婚，因其與乙女婚約尙未解除，至躊躇未決，彷徨無措，某甲雖曾向家中提出否認婚約要求，終因舊禮敎之束縛而不能舅願，現因急於解決，有問題數則，請貴律師予以指示，以傅循。（一）由父母作主而未經本人同意之婚約是否有效？（二）在法律觀點上，甲方能否單獨登報上否認此項婚約？（三）如甲方提出解約，乙方可否向甲方提出賠償損失之要求？（四）某甲已與丙女同居，如被乙女知悉，是否能訴甲或丙重妒或妨害婚姻罪？</p>

<h3>寄自青搗</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>××：</p>
<p>我敢說，你絕想不到我是這樣突然地給你一封寄自靑島的信。</p>
<p>眞的，我決定得太「突然」了，行前三日，我自己也「想不到」。是這樣的，我父親在上海住了兩週，使我稍稍事受了一點天倫之榮，他又走了。于是撩起我滿懷離愁！就在這百無聊賴的時候，一個突然的機會，引誘我動了一個突然的意念－去旅行吧？對！旅行可以遣散困惱的心情和思緒－因此我便突然地飛了！</p>
<p>如今，在我寫這封信的時候，我又突然決定，明天我再飛往另外一個地方去了。我竟對「突然」發生了濃厚的興趣，我很得意這種無計劃，不拘泥，洒脫，自由的行動！我曾冥想：要是我能一輩子這樣東飛西飛南飛北飛像一隻沒能子的島似的，哆美！</p>
<p>我在靑島得到不少的益處，（當然都是屬於精神的收獲。）昨天止，我殺靑了兩個長篇小說的尾巴，我是工作得那麽勤購，那麽興奮，文思就彷彿被海水濾過了一般，那麼暢流不滯！不像在上海，我是工作得那麽疲怠；那麽痛苦；那麽怨；那麽恨！同時，我的身體，心情也好多了；我整天呼吸着勝過人爲的維他命藥丸十萬倍的新鮮空氣；浴着溫柔而不强烈的陽光；漫遊在大書然的境界裏；享受那無邊的淸逸無邊的寧靜。你想，有什麽理由我還不健康，不快活呢？</p>
<p>靑島旣是這麼好，我不能不在臨別前夕，寫幾句話來贊美贊美她，也算向你介紹這座三面環水一面靠陸，（即正在爭奪戰中的膠濟路。）北方的山城。</p>
<p>不記得在哪位作的書上，把靑島譽爲中國的瑞士。我沒有到過過瑞士，不敢盲目附和。但說靑島是中國一個最美最文藝的地方，並不算誇張。</p>
<p>先從靑島的風景講起－掛着翠藍色紗幔的海窗，三面　敞地開在天地之間，在她的懷裏抱着碧綠色的山城，有無數珠紅色屋頂的洋房點綴着一片靑原，遠看，就像是盛開的桃李，或梅花！你能說，這不是一幅最典雅？最詩意；最美麗的畫麽？</p>
<p>再說到靑島的氣候－溽暑炎夏，如果你的心很靜，行動不太急躁，那你可以整天不出汗，晚上還要蓋上毛巾被。無論論是白日或夜間，都不斷刮着淸凉的海風。所以我認爲這裏才是避暑的勝地；不像牯嶺，峨眉，登峯造極以後，不至於過分得必須穿着夾袍，甚而並上火盆。（峨眉就是這樣。）據一個長住青島的人告訴我，冬季也只是一件呢大衣就足以禦寒了。那麽，這裏豈不是全年都在春秋中麽？</p>
<p>現在我簡單地根據一點皮毛巡禮的印象，談談靑島的社會狀况吧－她是一個國際性的都市，因此有着中西混合的情調。譬如建築，絕對都是歐化的，現代的，找不出一間古老的中國平房；即如厠所，也是洋式。這樣一來。便顯得非常的畫齊，美觀。每個人家差不多全有一個小院，小院裏你可以栽上花草。不像上海，每幢弄堂房子，大不了有一槐巴掌大的空地。花園洋房自然也有，但那只是少數人住的。這裏的商業似乎很蕭條，也都是中西俱備的生意。半條類似上海霞飛路的街，開着不少外國人的商店，但他們販賣的洋貨倒少，多是些北平的古玩。中國人開的古玩舖也不少。書舖子寥寥。薩據　院幾乎每條街都右，這點我右些不明白，像這樣一個不客易生病的地方何以醫藥業如此發達？賣西菜的咖啡店很多，中國飯館極少。茶葉店很多，茶館可沒有。海濱一家高尙的大咖啡店，有舞池，外國樂隊。但是舞者並不跡躍。市內也有幾家附舞池的咖啡店，這是爲美國水兵設施的，有歌女，有舞女。馬路像重慶的馬路，忽高忽低，但很光滑，乾凈自然，也有些角落裏還不免看見些垃圾，大糞。可是大體是淸潔的。大小馬路邊種植着梧桐白楊，俱已成蔭。交通方便，有公共汽車，小野鷄汽車（沿途搭客。）機器三輪車樣樣俱全。除了海濱你能碰到些摩登中西男女以外，在市內的行人道上，來來往往只是看見些淳厚，樸實的北方土佬兒。娘兒們還多半穿着半長的上衣，蓋脚的褲子。頭上挽髻的也有，這一點說來是和海濱情形不大調合的。然而在我看保持這些許多的北方古樸風味，也並不太有傷大雅。關於這裏的風俗，我遇到過一次本地出殯的，前面是奏于看　調的沒有情緒的　樂隊伍，都是穿紅着綠。接着兩頂花轎，敞開的，空着的，看到這裏，還以爲是娶親咧！但是却跟着披蔴帶孝的孝子，最後便是一具護了織錦棺罩的棺柩。這在我確還是第一次開眼，所以非常的好奇。關於這裏的人情，可比南方厚多了，要是你到本地入開的商店裏去買東西，他們會把你當上賓待承，一來就迎着，去時送着，儘管你折騰人家了半天，沒買成一件東西，他們也絕不哼一聲，照樣很客氣。討價也沒大虛頭。你上飯館去吃上三五萬元，只給個一千元左右的小賬，人家都嚷嚷着「謝謝」。（這一點風氣在北方各地都差不多。）現在該提到這裏的敎育文化，我從一位朋友那兒知道，相當的不景氣。一個大學即戰時毁滅的國立山大，織後趙太侔校長回來復興了，辦的成續不壞，有三院。醫學，理學，文學。請了不多名敎授，如丁西林，陸侃如，馮沅君等都在這裏。只是校舍，設備，還不十分充實，因爲是等於新創，困難很多，必須費些時間才能完善。其餘中小學也不太蓬勃。新聞事業也許還發達。報紙，通訊社不少。刋物也有幾種，比較文藝的多。內客郁當貧乏。銷路也不甚好，受了上海報紙和黄色刋物的影響很大。游藝力面戲劇偶然有一次業餘演出，目前上海的一個劇團在這裏打秋風，不知成續如何。平劇海派的劈紡型的演出生意奇佳。電影四家有三家是映着中國片子。幾個公園和各地的公園一樣平凡。整個地說，靑島是在進步中的，市面的情况也是安定的，並不似有一陣子外邊傳說的那樣恐怖，嗅不到絲毫火　氣，只晚間偶而有幾聲來自美國孩子的遊戲槍響。</p>
<p>上面，我是這樣潦草地２繪着靑島，我不知道會不會給你ｇ　個還可愛的慨念？我不管！反正我愛靑島，２靑島的一切，尤其是風景，氣候，人情！我多麽討厭上海啊！那份兒懂囂，那份兒亂，那份兒熱；那份兒狡詐，那份兒炎凉！</p>
<p>這些日子裏，我簡直沒看過任何朋友，（朋友也少得很），除了寫作，便是一個人蹤達出去散步，無論是海濱，山間，大街，小巷，我都跑到。無論是西餐館，咖啡店，舞憲，餃子舖，我也都坐過。我喜獨自遙遙逍逍地亂蛆磨，特別是在一個陌生的地方。人不認識我；我不認識人；不必在馬路上横點頭，覽招呼的；你愛怎麽着怎麽着，沒有誰管你；也沒有誰注你。哆自由！</p>
<p>在別人，或則會覺得我在這裏的生活太寂寞，一天到晚說不上二十句話，（無對象可談）悶也得給悶出病來！但我可不那麽想，相反地，越是在人多的地方，時候，我才感到無比的寂寞。我愛這種寂寞，這沈溺在大自然境界中的寂寞－唯獨在這種寂寞中，我才能接觸到眞我；我才能感受到無邊的淸靜；我的精神才能舒暢的解放；我的情感才能悠然昇華；我的靈魂才能憇息；我的心才能安定！</p>
<p>我常常想在海濱咖啡店裏，要一杯白蘭地慢慢的飲着，一面仰賞着茫茫無垠的藍海一面其思遐想着漫漫不着邊際過去未來未來！（自然都是些較愉快的事，凡足以煩擾我的事，我都把它揚開了）。我從黄昏坐到日落，從日落坐到日出，我忘了我還生存在羣的社會上，我眩惑地竟以州我我是生存在只有我自己的孤島了！若眞是這樣，哆好１</p>
<p>得！我準在這裏結束吧，等我趕明兒到了一個新的地方，再寫信給你。祝福！　（八月二十六日）</p>
<p>英·丁尼生作：</p>
<p>渡沙洲　眞勒試譯</p>
<p>日落和黄昏星，</p>
<p>和一個喚我的淸晣的呼聲！</p>
<p>但願不會有對沙洲的悲論腐，</p>
<p>當我向大海起　；</p>
<p>而這流動着的潮水像在安睡，</p>
<p>太充滿了聲音和浪花，</p>
<p>常那從無邊的海洋裏來的一位</p>
<p>重新回家。</p>
<p>薄暮和晚２，</p>
<p>這之后就是黑暗！</p>
<p>但願不會有吿別時的哀痛，</p>
<p>當我乘上海幣；</p>
<p>因爲雖然從我們時空底界限，</p>
<p>這洪流會帶我遠走，</p>
<p>我希望見到我底引路人，面對着面，</p>
<p>當我渡過了沙洲。</p>
<p>〔丁尼生（Alfred，Lord　Tennyson），英國羅多利亞女王朝大詩人，詳細介紹見八月六日本報「春秋」，不多贅。道首詩是丁尼生死前不久所作。第二詩節中所稱「從無邊的海洋裏來的一位」即指詩人自己，而「渡沙洲」云者，死也。詩人以生前死後之永恒比作「海洋」，「洪流」，而最後一詩節中之「引路人」（The　Pilot）即係上帝。－譯者〕</p>
<h3>浮沉　——寄阿野</h3>
<p>— 桑牧</p>
<p>說是要把生命拉得長些，打從小城子裏出來，呼吸在這十里洋塲的一角。法國梧桐下孤獨的漫步，有時偶然也會體味到生之意義，但當塡飽了空社後又有叧一種的難受，馬路上儘多往來的人，却依然如置身於大戈鐵裏。那裏來的靑草與水泉呢？</p>
<p>「爲了追逐麵包的碎府，是隔絕了友情的　　。』</p>
<p>於是人會變得黑搜下去，誰說不然。黄昏的凉風裏，且拉起煩燥的心弦，向遠方友人彈一曲寂寞之悲歌，再側耳靜聽那溫暖的回音。</p>
<p>來了，跋涉過萬草關山，封面的字樣眞是蒼老得多，我喜歡那焦黃的土紙，更讀上一週，是你寫的，又像我。</p>
<p>縱然盡飲鳩酒</p>
<p>眼前的寒傖也難湮沒</p>
<p>說匕首能休止生命</p>
<p>也難染上死之愁情了</p>
<p>設昨口是一個噩夢</p>
<p>今日又何嘗繼飾溫暖</p>
<p>若干年前的海市蜃樓</p>
<p>摸不着記憶的邊緣</p>
<p>但是這些單字積成的短句，是同情的溫暖，不，我的心兒更荒凉了，</p>
<p>時日在一長串悲哀的堆砌裏，光陰眞是老了。小城子的生涯，依希猶留腦際，湖上泛舟，杯酒高歌，促膝互訴衷陽，聽船家編一個老了的故事，若干年前的陳舊，電新復活在心頭，用乾杯來支持心底云向，歡笑開始在別的前夕，是一大把撕了的日　之後，你不再會艷羡而且讚頌，你說「設昨日是一個　夢」乘長風，破萬里浪，我會自傲也曾有了甜蜜的夢？</p>
<p>悄悄地，還得深深地呼吸，然而再也不會而且不願去編造一個綺　　的夢。能把生命一直拉着下去，是够幸福了。請別瞧着我的臉，厚了而皮我且如此說：「生活在這苦難的世紀裏，也眞是我們的幸運，從實生活去學習吧　！」</p>
<p>雖然我明明曉得你始終要說『牢騷是弱者的呼吸」，但我已把離開學校時同學們勗勉的手册末頁，塗上一句，我願意獻給我，爲了讓生命自生自滅，不用自己的手去毀滅它，我兢兢地寫着：「有職業總是幸福的！』</p>
<p>年靑的小小伙子呵！情　的高利貸的剝削下，我們已化盡所有的靑春去抵償了。不是貧血也得貧血，再禁不起過分苛重的負荷了，要重新溫習起春天裏的新鮮，朋友，讓我在你耳邊輕輕地說：「請打從實生活走去」。</p>
<p>嗎？鷄啼的黎明，我仍須爲塡飽肚皮來起一個淸早。</p>
<p>花鳥（指畫）　滕白也</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>耀羣和小老虎這一次進關，因要利用那張「通行證」，並未改裝，所乘客車，討了南下倭軍運兵的便宜，倒是快了四五個鐘頭。一到天津老站，客車受了阻碍，不能轉車上北平，被羣便跟小老虎計議，打算在天津躭擱一半天，一面打聽交通消息，一而要順便瞧瞧天津究竟糟到了什麽樣兒；反正時間很寬裕。</p>
<p>羣起先本想就在老龍頭老站一帶下旅館，後來忽然想到了一件事，便吿訴小老虎「暹上『法租界』去罷」。</p>
<p>「咱們雇車還是步踱，紀姨」？剛經過了無限麻煩，走出車站，小小老虎。麼問着。</p>
<p>一是要「看」嗎？…」東北人開口，多半是問句，耀羣然不能例外：「就便遽想買點零碎；咱們就遠們躂過去不行嗎」？</p>
<p>「行，紀姨…」小老虎一面答應着，一面東瞧西張，好像初次上城裏的鄕下人，街上什麼　初都　有一看的價値似的。</p>
<p>這時正在上午九點多鐘，南來的火車剛到，北去的也快要到點了，老龍頭附近這兩條街。人來人往，多如螞蟻，並不因淪陷而冷落，反而似乎更熱鬧。</p>
<p>「紀姨！」小老虎又要說話了。</p>
<p>「什麼？」耀羣也在法意街上情景；留心　　的人。</p>
<p>「咱們要不還是雇車罷？」小老虎舉起兩雙衣服小包袱。</p>
<p>「你嫌累？」耀羣瞧了瞧小老虎手裏的小包袱；「給我一隻罷，」說着便伸手去接；表示不要　　。</p>
<p>「不……這麽丁點東西，才兩三斤重罷咧，累什麼？」小老虎朝前走着，一雙眼睛仍舊不住的兩邊張望。</p>
<p>「紀姨！」走了沒兩步，小老虎又喊着耀羣。</p>
<p>「咦……這孩子！」耀羣心上有事；一方面還得留心她認爲應當注意的事。平日小老虎同耀羣在一起，總取一致行動，以羅耀華的目標爲目標，這時忽然如此攪混起來，一再打斷耀羣注意的事，耀羣不覺有些着怪。「你怎麼哪，虎弟？」</p>
<p>「沒什麼……」小老虎現出似笑非笑，欲語不語的一副　尬面孔：「我是說，這兒到「法界」，挺遠的一條路……」</p>
<p>「挺遠？」耀羣更加奇怪起來；「這麽兩步路，一二里就過橋，一過橋再走幾步就……」說到這裏，一眼瞧見小老虎目光掃射的所在，又注視了小老虎的神色一下，不禁笑了起來：「瞎……這孩子！」</p>

<h3>光榮的日子</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>—紀念勝利日而作</p>
<p>二年前的今天－一九四五年九月三日，是一個光榮而珍貴的日子。在這一天的上午，東京灣內的米蘇里　戰鬥艦上，拉開一幕莊嚴的好戲：日本帝國主義者倒下去了。我們的要（降官徐永昌將軍偕同盟邦的五星元帥麥克阿瑟以及其他的將軍們，以十八分鐘的時間，淸算了日本黷武者數十年侵略的罪惡，盟國勝利了，我們也翻身了！</p>
<p>這是多麼莊嚴的導演手法：美國的最大戰艦米蘇里號的四周，環圍着航空母艦，巡洋艦驅逐艦，安靜地停泊在東京灣中。時鐘指着八時半，白髮蕭蕭的尼米茲將軍蒞塲了，他與麥克阿瑟同爲五星元帥之一。又一刻鐘，麥帥出現，一時軍樂大奏，全體軍官敬禮。而我國代表團徐永昌將軍等六人，及其受降國的代表團，亦均先於八時四十分出塲。當時在旁觀降的新聞記者，總數將近四百人，他們忙着使用開麥拉和筆，從頭至尾爲這一幕戲留下紀錄，給後人紀念。</p>
<p>時鐘將移近九降了，十一個帶着滿臉晦氣相的日本代表團，以重光葵（代表日皇及政府）和梅津美次郞爲首，被美國軍官帶上甲板，艦上的軍樂隊也給他奏了一回，表示歡迎之意，因爲這是國際禮貌的緣故。甲板上的佈置計長桌一張，上覆以綠的　子；降書二份，墨水瓶一只，廣播機一具，簡單整齊，充滿嚴肅的氣氛。日本代表分三行站立，第一行是重光和梅津，第二行五人，第三行四人，他們一臉喪氣地佇立六分鐘，乃使其廬山眞面目，被權上人員瞧了個飽。尤其是重光葵，大槪因爲只有一只腿的緣故，顯得站着特力，汗不禁涔涔而下。</p>
<p>九時正，受降典禮開始，麥帥在廣播機前讀完了一館很短的廣播詞後，即命令日本代表簽字。第一個重光，爲了他只一隻腿，特賜他一個坐位；誰知他掬出的自來水筆竟是乾涸的，筆大而墨水瓶的口子小，欲吸水又不可能，窘得非常。還是一個美國軍官官借給他一桿筆，纔得了事。第二個是梅津簽，他有兩只腿，便沒得坐了。簽完字，退回云，原舊立正在那兒子，像一些怪總話的猴子似的。</p>
<p>接着，受降者簽字了，麥帥用六桿筆簽俗完了名字，其中有一桿送給了徐永昌將軍留作紀念。麥帥簽畢，即由我國代表徐將軍繼續簽字。其後，各盟國繼續地簽下去。運日本在內，共計十國，簽字時間僅費了十八分鐘，便演完了這幕史無前例的好戲。麥帥在典禮期間，除宣讀了廣播詞外，始終未發一言，也未採理日本代表，簽完了字，鄭行離塲，非常爽快。只有日本代表臉色個個都不好看別有一般滋味在心頭哩！當他們瘋狂地侵略中國，襲擊珍珠港，而躊躇志滿的時候，作夢也不會想到有米蘇里艦上的那麽一天吧１</p>
<p>然而，時間是最冷酷而無情的。物換星移，離開這光榮而珍貴的日子巳是二週年了。日本軍國主義者日皇制度未被廢除的掩護之下，業復逐漸「借屍還魂」；使我們緬懷過去，面對現實，又怎能不憂心忡忡呢！</p>
<h3>中國第一次　擊破日海軍</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>倭寇之亂史有紀載，彼以水師之强，常擾我江浙沿海，飽掠以去，而以明季最苦之。</p>
<p>考史載中國第一次擊破日本海軍，是在唐高宗時代，地點是在高麗的銷江口，凡焚燬倭舟四百餘艘，</p>
<p>因爲當時的朝鮮半島上，有着三個國家。是高麗，新羅，百濟。新羅親近中國，百濟則倚仗高麗支援，常常去侵略新羅，唐高宗以盟主自居出而調停，但給高麗和百濟的輕視，因之　室派兵征伐，起初由蘇定方征服，但是百濟不人得到了日本的援助，重行叛唐，乃派劉仁軌先平百濟，後征新羅，而擊破日本的海軍，也在這個時候。</p>

<p>註：全世界祗有說謊偵察機　具，一存美國，一存我國警察總署，見前幾天報載。</p>
<h3>日人來滬貿易　（光緒廿一年六月廿八日）</h3>
<p>日本對外貿易，又重行開放了。在中國工業停滯的現在，確是一種成脅。大家總還記得，戰前日本實在中國市塲傾銷的情形，虹口一帶，日本商店，林立櫛毗。這是十年前的景象，這在五十年前，巳有這種現象。</p>
<p>「中東和局已成，美租界揚子路東領事館，已於前日縣旗，東商之附船到申者，頗爲不少，蓬路，天潼路，百老匯路　處，所開雜貨店，密比如林，較時更形熱鬧矣。」</p>
<p>粵艾水災　（光緒四年七月十八日）</p>
<p>廣東東北西三江，淫雨成災，水位之高，已破二十年之紀錄。珠江三角洲，已成一片澤國，嗷嗷待哺之民，何至數十萬。政府要員，分頭籌款，以謀救濟。行總則以飛機散發糧食。考光緒四年？粤省亦適逢水災，本報曾誌其事：</p>
<p>「昨閱否港報紙，肇慶府降水為災，淹沒田湖盧舍，不計其數，而高要縣境之基團，又彼水　決，衰鴻啓蒙野，殊不　生，日業天緬晴郎，來價尚古，或可挽溝學之餘生也。又新會縣水勢，亦幾與隄平。錫山縣屬，則基圍已被衝矣。」（本報資料室輯）</p>

<p>作者通過了這個三角戀愛的故事，從側面表現了勝利之前大後方的醜惡的一而，這裏，我們不能不讚美作者的巧妙安排，看起來，似乎劇中那個女主角范嫣不可能愛上商人余友楠的，但是實際上在低一氣壓裏面生活的人，這一類的事情是太多了。而且作者的主題並不是太多了。而且作者的主題並不是表現戀愛的神聖與否，他所要傳達的是勝利前後的那些醜惡的現象。如果說不是官商勾結，那些貪污者衆多，余友楠十該，在勝利之夕就失敗了，然而不，他會向新的形勢投機發展。判處長的飛機把他送到了上海，僅僅這輕輕的一點，已經够交待了這個人物的一切了。戰爭時，余友楠發着國難財，勝利後，他又發勝利財，這一切都不是單憑一個商人想投機而能做到的。他的背後必須有人與他合作。——是現實的一部份，透過了這一部份，你就可以找到作老所企圖表現的主題了。</p>
<p>自然劇本是有着缺點的，作爲一個三角戀愛的幾個轉折，似乎交待不够，轉變也不够，但這些缺點依然不能減員於劇本的成乙尤其是港深致授的導濱，他更豐富了整個的演出，整個戲的處理在技術上圓熱洗總，這是難能可貴的配合，唯一的缺點是第四幕結尾，顯得鬆懈乏力，這是業中不足之處。</p>
<p>演員裏而，應該以葉子的范她與費克的李鍾秀最爲成功，前者的穩重油膩與後者　實生動，在在都使整個演出生色。其次要算江俟的孫克區與嚴　的汪奇了。可惜江俊的語言較差，略爲减色。奚蒙的胡子雲造型極佳。但尙缺少一點商人的習氣，戲也缺少起伏，太平直。此外刁光　的男主角余友楠，只演出了這個人物的一面，功架氣魄均有，但在女人面前的那一套功夫，這位「　油郎」是完全沒有，那未如何能獲得范　的全盤信任呢？這就成了問題。全劇最失敗的自然是演女主角范嫣的蘇茵了，旣不能把握住這個人物的性格，台詞唸得極差，又無風度，感情亳無起伏，戲每次轉到她身上時，就落下去了。那幾塲戀愛塲面，　扭而又生硬。這是整個演出中的上個損失。</p>
<p>舞台設計第二幕極佳。</p>

<h3>倒貼</h3>
<p>— 楚狂</p>
<p>上海某大銀行新近由渝調來職員一人。此君到後無屋可住，幸喜他是有點積蓄的便出了五千禽元頂了一所房子。事後他一算吿訴朋友說；「我每月拿行裏兩百多萬元，現在拿五千萬頂房子，這筆錢每月利息，就有一千萬，所以我每月貼行裏八百萬。」</p>
<p>這不是笑話。不是神話，也不是小說，是事實。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>猶太鑽石商在美國（下）</p>
<p>第二，到頭等鑽石舖可以買到最好的鑽戒，但價錢定得非常高，四五百美金一只的還看不上眼，不折不扣，那權貨色在南非洲化一百元美金是够了，渡了一次洋，就身價三四倍了，而且在强烈的燈光下，把黄色的鑽石也看做白色，買下來懊悔不及，拿回去退錢吧，一進店又在强烈的燈光下變成白色，依然無瑕可擊，如果硬要把鑽戒帶到街上陽光下去看，未免派頭太小，有失大主顧的體面，而且在數萬美金的大鑽石堆中，化四五百元買只鑽戒，已經覺得慚愧無地了，誰還肯吹毛求疵呢？</p>
<p>第三，最難應付的是開在邊街不大不小的次等鑽石商，這是著名的竹槓塲合，你走進了店堂，他們會把你總得團團轉，非買成功不可，但如果你懂得門檻，他們一定非常買你的賬，在這種店裏，有大鑽而根本沒有好鑽，假的不會出現克拉的鎭戒，他計價美金六百元，這價錢並不算貴，你得設克拉的鑽戒，他討價美金六百元，這價錢並不算貴，你得設法找出鑽石的毛病來，例如伶斑，破損，缺角，這些毛病要在放大鏡下才可看得出來，如果你把毛病找出，一上說淸，使他們佩服，然後講價，他們可以把定價六百元的鑽戒作六十元賣給你，拿到中國來，騙騙暴發戶，賣他三千萬元CNC，還袛說便宜。美國人戴鑽戒講究光彩，中國人講究碩大，所以有黑斑，有破壞，有缺角的大鑽戒在中國照議是風頭獨出，甚至假鑽Zikon一也可魚目混珠。非洲人用紙匣裝鑽石，美國人用薄紙包着，中國人用警察看着，　戒之這遇不同也如此，殆命也夫。（四）（七）</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi attended the Political Affairs Conference on the 2nd and reported on military affairs, stating that: Some people are currently very concerned about the war in the Henan-Hubei border area, but although the bandit army of Liu Bocheng's forces is rampant, it is not as serious as rumored. The future war situation will be determined in the Northeast. After the fighting in central Shandong and the Henan-Hubei area comes to an end, troops will be moved north. Minister Bai reported with great confidence in the war situation.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 2nd] Liu Bocheng's remnants now number only 20,000, divided into several small teams of about 1,000 to 2,000 men each, scattered in the border area of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, from Xuanhuadian in the west to Lihuang in the east, and from Shangcheng in the north to Songbu in the south. According to National Army observers, Liu Bocheng's fleeing troops have traveled 330 miles south across the Longhai Railway since August 11th. Although they looted a lot of supplies, they did not pose a major threat to the National Army. They believe that this fleeing communist general will no longer be able to escape the encirclement without suffering heavy blows as he has in the past. However, he may cause significant disasters to the local area before being driven out.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 2nd] The war in the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei border area has entered a new stage of going into the mountains to fight. The National Army is dividing into three routes to pursue and suppress in the mountainous area. On the morning of the 2nd, Shangcheng was recovered, and they continued to advance south. The National Army that captured Guangshan had cleared the remaining bandits in the urban area on the 1st. The main force of the remnants of Liu's 1st and 7th columns was surrounded by the National Army in the Lianhuachi area (south of Luoshan) on the 1st and is being annihilated. The National Army has increased its forces in the Yejiaji and Lihuang area, and the fighting is fierce.</p>

In this battle, the bandits suffered several times more casualties than the National Army. A force of more than a thousand remnants of Liu's 3rd column fled to Yejiaji, north of Lihuang, on the 1st, and a force of two thousand fled to Songbu on the same day. Both were driven away by the National Army and are now fleeing towards Songzisi. Liu's independent column is currently building fortifications in the Yangjiaqiao area north of Xuanhuadian, attempting to resist stubbornly. The National Army is currently attacking from the southwest and both sides.</p>

The central route attacked Macheng, and Huang'an was also under pressure. Reinforcements from Huangpi are rushing towards Huang'an, and there will be fierce fighting between Huang'an and Macheng. The bandits on the eastern route who reached the vicinity of Lihuang were blocked on the highway. Lihuang is firmly defended. It is very obvious that the bandits plan to flee into the Yinghuo Mountains between Hubei and Anhui.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei, 2nd] Three to four thousand communist bandits who fled from Shangcheng to Lihuang were still fighting fiercely with the National Army on the 2nd. Another force of more than a thousand people took the opportunity to flee east into the territory of Liu'an. A strong National Army force has gone to block and suppress them.

<h3>Hengshui Can Be Relieved Soon · Railway Between Luoyang and Shaanxi County Damaged ·</h3>
<p>[China News Agency Luoyang, 2nd] Luoyang has been experiencing heavy rain for days. Although the reinforcements rushing to Hengshui are inevitably delayed due to the muddy roads, the defending troops in Hengshui are extremely excited upon hearing the news. They have inflicted heavy blows on the bandits in recent days and are expected to be relieved within days. The residents of Luoyang are currently waiting for the good news.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The bandits besieging Hengshui, northwest of Luoyang, were repelled by the National Army on the afternoon of the 1st near Sundu, south of Hengshui.

<p>[Our Newspaper Taiyuan, 2nd] The bandits in western Shanxi are planning to attack Jixian County and have mobilized thousands of guerrillas from seven counties, including Shilou, Yonghe, and Xixian, gathering in the areas of Heshangling and Yaoqu northeast of Jixian County.</p>

<h3>National Flag Flying High at the Northeast Headquarters; Chief Chen Also Assumed Office Yesterday; Convened a Meeting of Generals in Shenyang That Evening</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] The national flag was flying high in front of the Northeast Headquarters on the 2nd. At 10:00 AM, Chief Chen Also led Chu Xichun, Che Fanru, and others to the headquarters. Deputy Chief Zheng Dongguo and other military officers lined up at the gate to welcome them. Chen entered the headquarters amidst music. After ascending the stairs, Xiong Shihui greeted him outside the office. After a brief handover in the room, they went to the auditorium, where military personnel, provincial and municipal chairmen, mayors, and other civil and military officials were waiting to be instructed.</p>
<p>Xiong and Chen took the stage. Xiong first delivered a speech, saying: "I am grateful for the cooperation of Commander Du, Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, local elders, civil and military officials over the past two years. The previous fall of the Northeast was not only a disgrace to the Northeast, but also a disgrace to China. Today, the Northeast is in a state of semi-fall, which is a disaster for the Northeast and China. I will never forget the complete recovery of the Northeast and will help to complete this task directly and indirectly in the future. Now that Chief Chen has come to concurrently serve as the director of the Northeast Headquarters, it will further strengthen the overall recovery and stability of the Northeast. At the same time, it is also a major proof that the central government attaches great importance to the Northeast. What I have accomplished in ten years can be accomplished by Chen in one year, and everything can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Finally, I wish you all success in your work, and Chief Chen success."</p>
<p>Chen then delivered a speech, saying: "Director Xiong has repeatedly requested to resign, and the central government has sent me to concurrently serve. I am determined to continue Director Xiong's work to complete the task. At the same time, we must not forget the hardships that Director Xiong has endured since the beginning of receiving the Northeast and over the past two years. Let us work together. The Northeast issue is an issue of the entire country and international security. Everyone must work hard. Not only is this necessary, but it also has its value for effort." After the speeches, photos were taken, and Xiong was sent out of the headquarters. Chen then began to work, first summoning Zheng Dongguo and the chief and deputy chiefs of staff to inquire and instruct. Then, he reviewed official documents and met with administrative personnel, and did not leave the headquarters until after noon. Northeast elders Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuhan attended Chen's inauguration ceremony as members of the Political Committee, and Chen treated them with great courtesy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] At 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, various circles held a farewell reception for Xiong and welcomed Chen.

Xiong said that he would fly to Beiping within days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] Chief Chen concurrently taking charge of the military and political affairs of the Northeast has brought clarity to the long-stagnant situation in the Northeast. The military has been busy planning in recent days, indicating that the situation will take a sharp turn for the better. It is generally predicted that the National Army will soon take the initiative to attack, possibly first clearing the bandit traces in southern Liaoning and the Andong Meihekou area, and then advancing northward to recover northern Songhua. Last night, Chen convened a meeting of generals here at the Second Guest House of the Headquarters, which did not break up until late at night. In addition, transportation on the Beining Road is frequent, all in preparation for the National Army's counterattack.</p>
<h3>Chief Chen Issues a Letter to the Military and Civilians of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 2nd] Chief Chen Cheng, after assuming office on the 2nd, issued a letter to the military and civilians of the Northeast, in which he stated two points to encourage each other. Chen first stated that in order to implement the original intention of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and to relieve the people's suffering, the central government had no choice but to order the mobilization of the whole country to step up the suppression of the rebellion. Therefore, the primary task of the headquarters in the future is to implement the government's policy of suppressing bandits. Secondly, he stated that it is appropriate to abandon extravagance and advocate frugality in time to reverse the declining trend. As for military discipline, it should be thoroughly rectified. If there are any violations of the law or harassment, they will be severely punished. At the same time, we should each be in our respective positions and perform our duties, seeking ways to self-reliance in the midst of difficulties.</p>
<h3>Northeast Political and Economic Committees</h3>

<h3>Commemorating September 3rd and Welcoming the Head of State; A Grand Gathering Will Be Held in Lushan Today; The Chairman Will Personally Attend and Give Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guling, 2nd] The Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of Japan's Surrender on September 3rd and the Guling All Circles Welcome Chairman Chiang's Visit to the Mountain Conference will be held jointly on the morning of the 3rd. At that time, the Chairman may personally participate and give instructions. If he cannot attend due to official duties, Wang Lingji will attend on his behalf.

<p>[Our Newspaper Guling, 2nd] Guling was still shrouded in heavy fog all day on the 2nd, a white expanse. The bizarre valleys and beautiful peaks were all hidden from view, and the pedestrians on the streets had a feeling of ascending to immortality. Chairman Chiang and his wife toured Huanglong at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, visiting the famous Lushan man-made forest in Jiangnan, and then had a picnic at the Huanglong Temple in the deep green mountains before returning at dusk.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 2nd] Local newspapers report that Chairman Chiang will fly to Hankou before returning to Nanjing, according to a special dispatch from Guling.</p>
<h3>Question of Opening Dalian Port; Rumor that the Soviet Union Rejected the US Protest</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 1st] According to usually well-informed sources, it is learned that the Soviet Union has rejected the US protest regarding the Soviet Union's refusal to open Dalian Port for international commerce.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources did not disclose the reasons for the Soviet Union's rejection, only saying that US officials have been notified that the Soviet Union is still unwilling to be forced to hand over Dalian to Chinese administration and does not want to open it as an international commercial port before signing a peace treaty with Japan. The most recent US protest on the Dalian issue was delivered to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on August 14. A protest was also lodged on January 3 this year. In its August 14 protest, the United States stated that "Dalian should be opened as an international free commercial port in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945." We now believe that there is no reason to delay its opening any longer, as the treaty only stipulates that the Soviet Union has the right to exercise military control over the port during wartime. The United States now believes that the war ended two years ago, but the Soviet Union insists that the war cannot be said to have ended until a peace treaty with Japan is signed.</p>
<p>In addition to protesting the Soviet occupation of Dalian, US officials also believe that the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty are not clear in wording. Although the treaty stipulates that Dalian must be handed over to the Chinese administrative authorities after the end of the war, it also stipulates that China must recognize the Soviet Union's "supreme rights" to interests in Dalian, so that two years after Japan's surrender to China, it has not yet been handed over to China.</p>
<p>Official sources commented that the Soviet Union's position is that the Dalian issue is purely a matter concerning China and the Soviet Union, but the United States, in view of Dalian's interests to the United States and the world, still insists that it should be opened as a commercial port. Officials are currently studying the Soviet Union's position. No final decision has been made on the steps to be taken. The United States and the Soviet Union have repeatedly argued over the Dalian issue in the past year. The Soviet Union had previously allowed US ships to sail to Dalian to deliver mail and supplies to the US consul there, but in March of this year, this was prohibited, and they were no longer allowed to enter the port. The above-mentioned supplies are now delivered to the US consul general there by Soviet ships.</p>
<h3>Tang Zong and Hu Bohan Fly to Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 2nd] Tang Zong completed his public affairs in Beiping and flew to Shenyang with Hu Bohan, deputy commander of the North China Air Defense.</p>
<h3>National Army in Northern Jilin Launches Attacks from Wula Street on Two Routes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Jilin, 2nd] The National Army in the northern Jilin area recently launched attacks from Wula Street on two routes, north and east, and is advancing forward. The northern route has cleared Sanjiazi, 60 li north of Wula Street, and firmly controls Xilanghe and Baiqitun (both north of Sanjiazi). The Shulan communist bandits have been threatened. The eastern route has captured Hongyao, and all its outer defensive positions are under the control of the National Army. The National Army in western Jilin has cleared the outer perimeter of Chalucha River, and a portion of its main force is currently operating in the area around Yilemen Station.</p>
<h3>Public and Commercial Vehicles in Hubei Province Under Military Control</h3>
<p>Commemoration of September 3rd Suspended</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 2nd] The Headquarters recently announced that military control will be implemented over public and commercial vehicles in Hubei Province and that they will be requisitioned when necessary. At the same time, it also ordered the suspension of the September 3rd Victory Commemoration Meeting to prevent the activities of traitors.</p>
<h3>China's Tin, Antimony, and Tungsten Ore Repayments; US Listed as National Strategic Reserves</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 1st] Chinese tin, antimony, and tungsten ores have now been listed as US military strategic reserves. The Treasury Department's Federal Supply Bureau and the Army and Navy Ordnance Bureaus are absorbing these special qualities from all over the world. Current inventory and from which countries they are purchased are military secrets and not known, but it is heard that China is one of the exporting countries. These strategic raw materials are currently used by China to repay part of its debt to the United States. The Export-Import Bank's total loans to China amount to 70 million US dollars, stipulated to be repaid by China in metal in the future, and are therefore called "metal loans." The loan agreement was signed in 1940 and will expire next year. According to the bank, China is quite capable of fulfilling the agreement. The rumor circulating in China that Chinese tungsten production is being purchased entirely by the Soviet Union at inflated prices in cash is considered inaccurate here. According to the Metal Reserve Bureau of the Construction Finance Corporation: "No Chinese tungsten has been shipped this year, and we don't need it. The United States does not lack tungsten reserves, so it only purchases antimony from China." The US government does not disclose the amount of tungsten it stores, but other sources believe that a considerable amount of tungsten is being shipped to the Soviet Union. According to a retired official who was stationed in China during the war: "Between 1938 and 1939, the Chinese government concluded a barter agreement with the Soviet Union. China obtained military supplies from the Soviet Union, and China supplied the Soviet Union with metals. The detailed contents of this agreement have not been published, but there is no doubt that the Soviet Union obtained a large part of the metal produced in China through this agreement."</p>
<h3>Wei, the Envoy, Flew to Tokyo Today After Completing His Work in Korea; Farewell Words Express Hope for Unity Among Korean Parties</h3>
<p>[United Press Seoul, 2nd] General Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly to Tokyo on the 3rd and to Hawaii on the 5th. On his last day in Korea, Wei told a special meeting of the Korean Provisional Assembly: "The unity of Koreans at home and abroad and the unity of parties will enable the goals of Korean strength and unification to be achieved quickly. The future happiness and well-being of your people will be greatly influenced by your foresight and your actions."</p>
<p>[US Information Service Seoul, 1st] General Wedemeyer visited Busan yesterday, where he listened to various opinions on political and economic issues raised by Koreans (approximately 150). Other members of the Wei mission were divided into three groups on the same day to inspect factories and port facilities in Busan and to conduct individual surveys of many Korean officials, farmers, and small businessmen. Today, this survey work continued in and around Seoul, led by General Wedemeyer, listening to the opinions of American and Korean officials and individual visitors.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 2nd] Martial law was officially announced here starting on the 2nd. Except for those with special permits, no one is allowed to pass through at night, but the general public believes that Liu's bandits will be severely hit, so people are calm and the market has not fluctuated significantly.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Army Attempts to Invade the Main Peak of Beitashan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beitashan, 1st] It is very obvious that the Outer Mongolian army has been increasing its troops to Beitashan in recent days, attempting to gradually move its main force towards Da Xiaosongshu, in order to take the opportunity to attack the main peak of Beitashan, Alter Naoba. The peak is 1,845 meters high, located in the wing of our army's position, Hujuerte, commanding a strategic position. For half a month, the peak has been covered with white snow, and the temperature is between five and six degrees, freezing in an instant. When the mountains are sealed by heavy snow, it is not a place for military operations, so the Mongolian army's attempt was expected by our army.</p>
<h3>Liao Yaoxiang and Others Assume Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 2nd] Liao Yaoxiang, commander of the 4th Army Corps, Shu Shicun, deputy commander, and Li Tao, commander of the New 8th Army, were sworn in at Tieling yesterday.</p>
<h3>Overseas Foreign Exchange Assets of Chinese Citizens Should be Automatically Declared and Registered; Ministry of Finance Formulates Regulations to be Submitted to the Full Economic Committee for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the regulations on the declaration and registration of overseas foreign exchange assets of Chinese citizens, the Ministry of Finance has made a concrete decision and will submit it to the Full Economic Committee for discussion. The main content of the regulations is that Chinese citizens should automatically declare their overseas foreign exchange assets and transfer them to the Central Bank. This matter does not mean that the overseas foreign exchange assets will be frozen. If there are needs such as medical treatment and travel, they can still be used. Those who do not declare will be severely punished. According to authoritative sources, the claim made by Wei Demai that Chinese assets in the United States amount to 1.5 billion refers to "assets." Since there are so many overseas Chinese in the United States, 1.5 billion in assets should not be too much.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the investigation of the implementation of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to use overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, the Control Yuan previously made a resolution, and recently assigned several supervisors to go to the Ministry of Finance and other relevant agencies to investigate thoroughly, and it will be clarified soon.</p>

<h3>British Parliamentary Delegation to China to Arrive in Nanjing Before Double Tenth Festival; The Head of the Delegation Eagerly Hopes for Peace and Unity in Our Country</h3>
<p>[British Information Office London, 2nd] The British Parliamentary Delegation to China will leave the UK at the end of this month and is expected to arrive in Nanjing before the Double Tenth Festival. The delegation is led by Sir Emrys-Evans, and members include Sir Amery, MacLehose, Harrison, Roberts, and Lindsay. During their stay in China, they will be guests of the Chinese government. In a recent communique, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie expressed full agreement with the British proposal to send a parliamentary delegation to China and traced back to the visit of the British parliamentary delegation to China in 1942. He continued: "At that time, the delegation traveled extensively in China and made a significant contribution to strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries during the war." Sir Emrys-Evans recently stated in a discussion on the current delegation: "Britain very much wants to see a peaceful and united China." This view was also expressed during the debate on China in the House of Lords earlier this year, and the Foreign Secretary also expressed the same sentiment in the recent debate on foreign affairs in the House of Commons. Although no fixed itinerary has been announced for the current delegation, it is generally understood that the delegation hopes to observe China as much as possible during their one-month stay in China.</p>

<h3>Beiping Garrison Headquarters Decides to Expand Organization</h3>
<p>To be Directly Under the Ministry of National Defense</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 2nd] Military authorities have decided to expand the Beiping Garrison Headquarters into the Beiping Garrison General Headquarters. The rumor that a Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters will be established is inaccurate. The expanded organization will have jurisdiction over the Pingjin Road, Tianjin, and Tanggu and will be directly under the Ministry of National Defense, and the Beiping Executive Headquarters or the Baoding Pacification Headquarters will be temporarily authorized to command it nearby. The Tianjin Command Post of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters has been decided to be abolished. Whether the Beiping Command Post will be abolished has not yet been determined. An observer pointed out that after the area under the jurisdiction of the Beiping Garrison General Headquarters extends eastward to Tanggu, the sea route of Beiping, the heart of North China, can be consolidated due to the unity of guidance.</p>
<h3>Our Delegation to Japan's Name: Allied Headquarters Deems Non-Compliant; Trade Guidance Council Cables Ambassador Koo to Explain to the U.S.; National Federation of Commerce and Industry Opposes Opening Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] The Trade Guidance Council for Japan held another meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss the following important issues: (1) Zhang Tianheng and Tian Heqing, representatives from the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and the Industrial Association, attended the meeting and stated that both associations agreed to send representatives to Japan for observation and investigation, but opposed sending people to Japan for business; at the same time, they did not agree to open trade with Japan, believing that it would provide an opportunity for Japanese goods to be dumped. During the meeting, it was explained that sending personnel to Japan for observation was inconsistent with the regulations of the Allied forces. As for the dumping of Japanese goods, our import restrictions are extremely strict, and it will not affect our industry. Finally, it was hoped that both groups could send representatives to Japan. (2) Koo Vi-kyuin, our ambassador to the United States, telegraphed, stating that the U.S. side believed that the name "delegation" was inconsistent with the original regulations. The meeting decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should inform Ambassador Koo that the term "delegation" was used internally for guidance purposes, while externally, individuals would still act in their personal capacity. The U.S. side also had doubts about our dispatch of representatives from public and joint ventures. The meeting also requested Ambassador Koo to explain that public and joint ventures had private capital but were enterprise companies, no different from ordinary companies. (3) Some industrial and commercial associations requested that Japanese *seed species be prohibited from being transported to Taiwan, not to Jiangnan. It would be acceptable if these materials were not imported, and it would be better if domestic supply was possible. However, this matter must be determined based on climate and other conditions. It was resolved that this matter be referred to the silk association guidance council for discussion. (4) Regarding the import of rayon, some people did not advocate the import of rayon but advocated importing raw silk. However, others believed that rayon was needed for silk reeling. Finally, it was decided to proceed roughly according to the original method. In addition, the nominees for the delegation to Japan have been internally determined by the China Trust Bureau, China Salt Company, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, etc., while other aspects have not yet been finalized.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] At the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 2nd, more than two hours were spent discussing the implementation measures for the outline of economizing consumption. The committee members expressed their opinions, and it was finally decided to hold a review committee on the morning of the 3rd for combined review and to hold a temporary meeting on the 5th to re-discuss the implementation measures for economizing consumption.</p>
<p>According to the resolution of the State Council, the outline and implementation measures for economizing consumption were originally scheduled to be announced and implemented simultaneously on September 1st. Zhai believed that the outline included too many departments, and the competent departments should formulate implementation measures based on their respective businesses, which would then be reviewed by the Executive Yuan. However, there were many overlapping conflicts in the various implementation measures. At last week's routine meeting, the Executive Yuan appointed Wang Yunwu, Jiang Gouchen, Yang Liangjun, Zheng Zhenwen, Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Qitian, and others to form a special review committee, convened by Wang Yunwu. The review committee held two meetings on August 29th and 30th, and completed the review of 13 types of measures. Ten types remained to be reviewed this week, resulting in only the outline being announced on September 1st, and the implementation measures could not be announced, thus delaying the implementation of economizing consumption.</p>
<p>At the meeting on the 2nd, President Zhang presided over the meeting. After the foreign affairs and national defense reports, the reviewed implementation measures were submitted for discussion. The committee members spoke one after another, believing that 23 types of implementation measures were too many, and the measures themselves could not economize, which was not a good strategy. It was finally decided to resubmit them for review to strive for simplicity and clarity to facilitate implementation. The review committee on the 3rd was decided to be convened by Secretary-General Gan Naiguang to study with the vice-ministers of various departments.</p>
<h3>Thirteen Types of Review Completed</h3>

<h3>Zhonghe Bridge Massacre in Beijing Sentenced, Main Culprit Adore Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Rooks Requesting Washington for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] Rooks, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, received reporters at 12:30 on the 2nd and announced the verdict on Adore, the main culprit in the Zhonghe Bridge massacre. Rooks first read the original text of Articles 92 and 93 of the U.S. military law, and then read the main text of the judgment, stating: "Forfeit all salaries and allowances after the crime, and dishonorably discharge him, sentencing him to life imprisonment." He then announced that the military court's trial concluded: Corporal Adore was tried on charges of murdering Ge Fatian and Wang Diben at Zhonghe Bridge on the night of August 1. The trial of the court believes that the Ge Fatian part is guilty of murder under Article 91 of the military law, and the Wang Shouben part is guilty of manslaughter under Article 93 of the military law, not murder, so the above judgment is made. It is said that after Wang Shouben was put into the water, the perpetrator should have known that his actions were murder, but he continued to do so. Afterwards, he called the airport military police in an attempt to cover up, which was obviously murder of Ge Fatian. Rooks believed that this judgment was very appropriate and had been approved, and was submitted to the Pentagon in Washington for review. If the Pentagon also approves it, the case will be concluded, otherwise President Truman will make the final decision. It is reported that this judgment will also be sent to our relevant agencies.</p>
<h3>Internal Drafted Measures to Prohibit Dancing, Political Committee Believes Too Broad, Argues to Order by Decree During Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 2nd] According to the provisions of the Outline for the Implementation of Economizing Consumption, commercial dancing will be prohibited. The Interior Ministry has drafted implementation measures accordingly. When submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion on the 2nd, the committee members believed that the measures were too broad. If implemented according to these measures, some dances would be protected by the law, and those who did not dance would also start dancing. Some committee members argued that the ban on dancing could be ordered by decree, without the need to formulate separate measures. No conclusion was reached on this matter at the meeting and will be submitted to the review committee for joint review on the 3rd. It is reported that the original measures drafted by the Interior Ministry stipulated that commercial dance halls refer to places that set up music, have dance floors, and sell dance tickets or admission tickets, etc., exclusively for people to enter and dance with dance girls or dance partners. Coffee shops, restaurants, music halls, tea houses, bars, hotels, and other places that also operate commercial dancing are considered commercial dance halls. Commercial dance halls should be ordered to close within a time limit by the local government, but all should be closed within three months. Those who violate the rules will be sealed by the local government. Before closing down, dance halls should shorten their daily business hours and close down in stages. As for the steps and methods, the local governments should consider the actual situation and draft them in advance to report to the Interior Ministry for verification. Those who have not set up commercial dance halls shall not be established in the future, and those who are currently preparing to do so shall be ordered to stop immediately.</p>

(A) The Yi unrest in Kang Province has been quelled, and it is now very stable. (Q) How is the implementation of the general mobilization order in various places?

<h3>Reflections on Two Years of Victory — Also a Response to the Doubts of the Da Mei Evening News —</h3>
<p>Two years ago today, the Chief of Staff of the former Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, Yoshijiro Umezu, and the representative of the Japanese government, Mamoru Shigemitsu, formally signed the Japanese surrender document to the Allied forces on the deck of the American battleship 'Missouri' in Tokyo Bay, marking a pivotal moment in human history. From the day Japan formally surrendered, a cruel war ended in human history, and a bright and splendid new page should have been turned. However, on this anniversary two years later, we don't even seem to have the mood to "force a smile."</p>
<p>Why is this? Half of it is our own lack of effort; half is the fading of circumstances. The friends who shared hardships during the war seem to have blurred the lines between enemies and friends. As a result, the former enemy is complacent and eager to try again; while the former allies criticize each other, or even go their separate ways!</p>
<p>I remember last year today, although defeated Japan was struggling to recover, it was still under the control of the Allied forces and had no hope of turning over and rising again. General MacArthur issued a statement that day, saying that "the world is shrouded in the shadow of suspicion and uneasiness due to the erosion of harmful ideas; if this kind of thinking is allowed to spread without restriction, individual freedom will be wiped out. What position will Japan occupy in the world in the future? Will it be a fortress of peace? Or will it become a springboard for war?" It can be seen that General MacArthur still had doubts about the future of Japan at that time, but as of today, everything in Japan seems to have changed greatly: not only in the consciousness of the Japanese people, they have almost ceased to recognize themselves as a defeated country, but they have probably also forgotten the scene of the Japanese representatives signing the surrender document on the American warship, and regard the United States as their savior! Although the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, private foreign trade in Japan has been reopened on August 15; the issue of compensation seems to have been shelved. It is no wonder that the Japanese are so ecstatic that their ambitions of aggression are secretly trying to revive. According to foreign news agency reports, Japan intends to make three demands to the future peace conference with Japan: (1) jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States; (2) obtain special immigration rights to Taiwan; (3) obtain fishing rights in Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Just from this matter, the arrogance of the Japanese can be seen without saying.</p>
<p>How could defeated Japan become so arrogant in just two short years? On the one hand, it is indeed because General MacArthur and his colleagues were inevitably blinded by the Japanese fox-like policies, and became gentlemen who were "easily deceived by their methods," thinking that this former Eastern enemy could be a docile servant, and no longer considering the consequences of their excessive tolerance. But on the other hand, we cannot help but deeply blame ourselves. Why did we waste two years of good time, letting China be consumed in the turmoil woven by "peace talks" and war? At the same time, why didn't we start by rectifying officialdom and suppressing rebellion at the same time, working hard to move forward, in order to lay the foundation for a peaceful, unified, and powerful new China, causing us to be ridiculed by friendly countries and laughed at by enemies? According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, the US authorities plan to set the US-Japan exchange rate at one dollar to 130 yen. Based on this calculation, the Japanese yen, which was less than one yuan of our country's legal tender before the war, is now worth 300 yuan of our country's legal tender. Is it not a strange thing in the world that the currency of the victorious country is not as valuable as that of the defeated country? This is really worthy of our painful reflection as self-proclaimed victors!</p>
<p>However, today's world, whether peace or war, is obviously inseparable. Therefore, the evolution of the situation in the two years since Japan's surrender, in the Far East, especially in China, we should not only deeply reflect on ourselves and move towards actively saving ourselves, but also not allow anyone to ignore the adverse external influence of the reversal of the international situation on China. Our newspaper's editorial the day before yesterday, "What will the United States do to China?" The Da Mei Evening News published an editorial yesterday, asking back, "What will China do to help itself?" Our American colleagues said: As long as China can indeed do some self-help things, the United States will be happy to fulfill its part. The Da Mei Evening News also made it clear: "The work of the United States cannot be preliminary, but with the backing of appropriate Chinese self-help, it may eventually be a decisive work." We warmly welcome this frank expression from our allies, and dare to say that China has decided to embark on the road of "self-help" first. We must seize the fruits of victory, our people must eliminate all corrupt elements as much as possible, and we must also urge the government to work hard on various reforms to strengthen the administrative efficiency of political and economic facilities. This is the only way for the Chinese people to help themselves. Even without the advice of friends, the Chinese people will work hard to achieve it. However, at the same time, we must remind our American allies of two important points:</p>
<p>(1) The overall cause of the current situation in China is the eight years of protracted war and the rebellion of the CCP after the war. The Soviet Union intentionally aided the CCP rebellion, and the indecisive policy of the United States towards China indirectly delayed the government's policy of suppressing the communists, which was equivalent to condoning the CCP's growth. Both the Soviet Union and the United States were China's allies during the war, but they are now fighting each other!</p>
<p>(2) China must save itself and help itself, but after the war, just like the United Kingdom, it also hopes for the assistance of close friends. Like medical treatment, the most important thing is to be timely; otherwise, even if it is effective, it will be twice the effort with half the result. Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, why did the National Government make such amazing progress? We should think of Lytton, who came to China in those years to help us establish a legal tender policy, which made the national construction advance rapidly and the strength of the Anti-Japanese War was also cultivated. Now, the vitality after the war is greatly damaged, and the value of the currency urgently needs to be stabilized. We must wait for the economy to be consolidated before all politics can get on track. If the American allies really intend to aid China, they should pay attention to the root cause of the disease. The urgency of the time is fleeting, and they must not hesitate to wait and see again.</p>
<p>In a word, who does the United States want to find as a friend in the East, the enemy of two years ago—Japan? Or the allied country that fought hard for eight years and shared weal and woe—China? We dare to say that Japan may look like a "loyal servant" today, but it may not be a rebellious and fierce servant in the future. Because if the Japanese people are not subject to long-term "re-education," they still dream of one day being the masters of the world and are unwilling to be servants forever. Only China is always determined to stand on an equal footing with the Allies as a trustworthy and loyal friend, neither having the ambition to be the master of the world, nor willing to bow down and make a "servant" on the surface to please friends!</p>

<h3>Our Rice Production Ranks First in the World</h3>
<p>Reaching Over 44 Million Metric Tons Last Year</p>
<p>[Report from New York by the Central News Agency, 1st] According to the United Nations Statistical Monthly released today, China remains the leading country in world rice production.

<h3>Pan-American Conference Concludes Successfully; Truman Delivers Closing Remarks; Stresses that the Threat of Aggression Still Exists; and Guarantees to Safeguard World Peace with Money and Military Force</h3>
<p>[Report by this newspaper] Broadcast from San Francisco, 2nd: In his closing remarks at the Pan-American Conference, Truman stated: Most countries in Europe and Asia are currently under the threat of military aggression, and he guaranteed that the United States will fully safeguard world peace with military force and money. The United States is greatly disappointed with the post-war situation and must prepare for a long-term occupation of enemy territory. Many countries are still under the control of foreign forces. Although Truman did not directly specify the Soviet Union's foreign policy in Central and Southern Europe, there is no doubt to whom his words were directed. Mr. Truman said: "I do not believe that the current international disputes cannot be resolved without the use of force. We will do our best to avoid anything that would increase international tensions. We will continue to work to maintain lasting peace. We are determined to maintain our strength. Our avoidance of the use of force must not be misinterpreted as a lack of determination to abide by the obligations of the United Nations Charter, or to condone others from arbitrarily undermining the foundations of international peace. Our determination to maintain our military strength is precisely proof of our serious attitude towards our obligations. The United States is determined to do its best to provide economic assistance to countries that intend to help themselves. However, the economic resources of the United States are by no means inexhaustible, so I urge other countries in the New World to jointly assist the countries in the Old World. The countries in Europe and Asia that have been washed by war should have priority in obtaining economic assistance." Truman pointed out that the world powers have failed to reach a consensus on peace treaties with the defeated countries, so we have to consider extending the period of military occupation in the enemy countries. Mr. Truman repeatedly guaranteed that the United States will strengthen the United Nations organization to make it a more effective world peace organization. At the same time, he declared: "The United Nations is now encountering pressure. The task of the United States is to maintain peace, not to create peace."</p>
<p>[Report from Rio de Janeiro by the Central News Agency, 1st] President Truman received an unprecedented welcome here today. President Truman flew here from Washington on a special plane, and Brazilian President Dutra and all senior officials went to greet him. Marshall also personally went to the airport to greet him. When the President and his party crossed the harbor, Brazilian warships fired a 21-gun salute to pay their respects.</p>
<p>[Report from Rio de Janeiro by the United Press, 2nd] US President Truman arrived here on the 1st, and the Brazilian people welcomed him along the street, which is considered an unprecedented event in history. After flying a 4,500-mile journey on the President's special plane, it landed at Guanabara Bay Airport here. Mr. Du then drove to the US Embassy, ​​and one million Brazilians greeted him along the seven-mile road. President Du and his wife and daughter, Margale, came here to attend the closing ceremony of the Pan-American Defense Conference. Mr. Du will deliver a speech and address a joint session of the Brazilian Congress. The 7th is Brazil's Independence Day, and Mr. Du will also attend the celebration.</p>
<h3>The Principles of the Potsdam Agreement Are Irrelevant to the Peace Conference with Japan; US State Department Studies the New Soviet Note</h3>
<p>[Report from Washington by the Central News Agency, 1st] A US State Department official stated: The State Department is currently studying the new note that the Soviet Union gave to the United States yesterday. In the note, the Soviet Union still refuses to accept the United States' proposal to convene an 11-nation peace conference with Japan, and reiterates its past position, advocating that the convening of the peace conference and the drafting of the peace treaty should be in the hands of the Council of Foreign Ministers, as it should be when drafting the European peace treaty.</p>
<p>US officials also stated: State Department officials are studying the new note from the Soviet Union, wanting to find any "possibility" in it that can reconcile the differences between the US and the Soviet Union, and it is expected that a step may be taken by the end of this week. Judging from the Soviet Union's note, the Soviet Union believes that convening an 11-nation peace conference (composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission) violates the Potsdam Agreement, but at the time of the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union had not yet fought against Japan, and China, one of the main countries fighting against Japan, did not participate in the Potsdam Conference. Therefore, the decisions of the Potsdam Conference only apply to the European peace conference. As for the peace treaty with Japan, it is a completely different issue. If the procedures stipulated in Potsdam apply to the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, then the powers must check another new agreement on the issue of Japan, but in fact this agreement does not exist.</p>

<p>[Report from Canberra by Reuters, 2nd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said in his address at the final meeting of the Commonwealth Peace Conference that Japan must contribute its strength as much as possible to the task of improving the living standards of Southeast Asia and the Pacific region.

<p>Lord Addison, Minister of Commonwealth Relations of the British Commonwealth, said in his address that he hopes that the success of this Commonwealth Conference can be used as a reference for other conferences. Canadian Defense Minister Claxton and New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser also spoke, expressing satisfaction with the achievements of the conference.</p>
<p>[Report from Canberra by the Associated Press, 2nd] A spokesman for the Australian government announced today that the United States has indicated that it can accept the proposal of the British Commonwealth Conference, that is, the first step in the peace conference with Japan should be for the foreign ministers of the countries concerned to personally attend discussions in Washington within a few weeks to determine the policy. The first step is for experts from various countries to draft the peace treaty in accordance with the agreement established at the Washington Conference. After the peace treaty is drafted, it will be submitted to the final meeting of the peace conference for review and voting. This final meeting will also be attended by the foreign ministers of the countries concerned in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>[Report from Canberra by the Central News Agency, 1st] The British Commonwealth Conference agreed today to establish a supervisory committee to supervise the implementation of the treaty after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. The conference recommends that the supervisory committee be composed of all countries that directly participated in the war, or at least the 11 member states of the Far Eastern Control Commission, plus Pakistan. The committee may intervene when it finds that Japan is not fulfilling the provisions of the peace treaty. The committee will control certain imported materials, such as oil and war materials. It is generally agreed that after the signing of the peace treaty, the Allied forces should interfere in Japanese affairs as little as possible. The Allied forces stationed in Japan will withdraw now, but the Japanese constabulary may be stationed in Japan after being reorganized.</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of Japan's Surrender; MacArthur Praises Japan's Successful Revival; Advocates that the Peace Treaty with Japan Should Strive to Be Generous and Fair</h3>
<p>[Report from Tokyo by New Asia News Agency, 2nd] Today is the second anniversary of the Allied victory over Japan. MacArthur issued a commemorative message, stating briefly: It has been two years since Japan signed the surrender document. During this year, Japan has been able to faithfully fulfill its vows. The Allied military occupation of Japan focuses on moral value and is unprecedented in history, using justice as the basis for everything instead of force.</p>
<p>It has been decided that the peace treaty with Japan will be discussed at the preparatory meeting soon. At this meeting, it is necessary for us to adopt a generous and fair attitude. Furthermore, since Japan's surrender, with the guidance of the Allied forces and the assistance of the United States, it has gradually restored its devastated economy. Industrial production has now reached more than 45% of the pre-war standard, and its upward trend may continue in the future. However, if Japan is to become a self-reliant country in the future, it is absolutely necessary for the United Nations to revise its trade methods with Japan and prevent Japan from falling into economic isolation. If Japan after the signing of the peace treaty can stand on the same basis of freedom and peace as other countries in the international community and be given the opportunity to survive, then the democratic political model that has already sprouted in Japan will not threaten the world and will allow the Japanese people to obtain a normal and peaceful life).</p>

<h3>Trial of Yu Shengxiao Murder Case Opens in U.S. Military Court; Five Witnesses Testify to Malai's Disadvantage; Relevant Chinese Authorities Send Personnel to Observe; Defendant Arrives in Military Uniform and Claims Innocence</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The sensational murder case of Yu Shengxiao, with the American Staff Sergeant Malai as the suspect, was brought to trial by the U.S. military advisory group in a military court organized on the third floor of the American Military Cemetery at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The court consisted of eleven U.S. military officers, with Colonel Palmer as the chairman. The other judges were Colonel Stanney, Colonel Kakobu, Lieutenant Colonel Lawson, Lieutenant Colonel Whitt, Lieutenant Colonel Shaw, Major Turrent, Major Smith, Major Little, Major Eggers, and Captain Boswell. The prosecutor was Captain Olney. The defendant had four defenders: two civilians, Borokin and Ms. Stobaugh, and two military personnel, Major Acheson and Captain Patrick. Those from relevant Chinese departments who attended the observation included Court President Cha Tingke, Judge Zhu Yuhuang, Prosecutors Ding Guojun and Cao Hong, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office Chen Guolian, Section Chiefs He Xingren and Xie Zhijian, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Office Wei Jingmeng, and municipal government councilors. Defendant Malai, still in military uniform, sat on the right side of the court, accompanied by his defenders. The accomplice, Cheli, was escorted by Chinese judicial police to the waiting room in the morning. The wife of the deceased, Yu Shengxiao, Mrs. Lu, arrived with her children in the morning. A total of thirteen Chinese and foreign witnesses appeared in court for questioning.</p>
<p>The courtroom was dimly lit, with electric lights on even during the day. The eleven military judges sat facing outward, with the American military flag hanging behind them. The courtroom was guarded by military police both inside and out, and the atmosphere was solemn and quiet. At precisely 9:00 a.m., the prosecutor announced the cause of the case, and all the judges swore an oath and took their seats. The prosecutor first asked Malai if he was guilty, and Malai immediately stood up and declared his innocence. Then, the first witness, Major McLunn, was summoned. After raising his hand and swearing an oath, McLunn stated that before the bloody incident occurred, Malai told him that he had no money and had come to Shanghai to collect his salary. However, when he arrived at the cashier's office on Saturday, he stated that he had about ninety U.S. dollars. The second witness summoned was Younovitz, the owner of the New Lido Bar on Rue Airo. He said that Malai had visited the New Lido twice on August 1st, once in the early afternoon and once at 3:00 p.m. At this point, the defendant's defender, Borokin, strenuously cross-examined, trying in every way to get the witness to confirm that he had seen Malai on August 1st in order to exculpate Malai. Although the witness could not give a very precise time, he insisted on the meeting. He also said that he seemed to have seen Malai and Cheli enter the bar together, but because the impression was not deep, he could not be sure.</p>

<h3>Car Owner Polov Proves Malai and Cheli Were in the Same Car</h3>
<p>After Younovitz left, the third witness summoned was Polov, the Russian car owner. Polov said that he had known Cheli for two years. On the morning of August 1st, Cheli came alone to borrow the car. At 4:30 p.m., Cheli drove away near the Cathay Hotel, saying he was with a friend and did not need the original driver. At 8:10 p.m. that evening, Cheli returned to the Cathay, paid 800,000 yuan as a reward, and asked Polov to first take his friend to the Broadway Mansions and then take him home. At that time, he had not noticed anything unusual about the car. Two days later, he discovered dried blood stains in the car and immediately reported it to the police. At this point, the judge asked if he could identify the friend of Cheli he had driven. Polov said "Of course" and immediately pointed to Malai in the defendant's seat. After the questioning was completed, it was past 12:30 p.m., and the court announced a recess until 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Studying the Map</p>
<p>The court reconvened promptly in the afternoon. Because of the hot weather and the lengthy questioning, the number of people in the audience decreased sharply, and those present called it a "fatigue trial." The fourth witness was U.S. Army Sergeant Ross, who had drawn a map of the crime scene after the incident. At the summons of the judge, Ross explained the method of drawing the map in front of the map. The judges, the prosecutor, and the defendant's defenders also stepped forward to study it together and found it satisfactory. Ross then left. At 2:05 p.m., the most important witness, Cheli, was summoned, and the entire court was energized. Cheli, wearing a green shirt and blue trousers, entered calmly, with a dull expression on his face. After entering the witness stand, the prosecutor solemnly asked him to raise his hand and swear an oath, and then began the long questioning that lasted two and a half hours.</p>
<p>Cheli Being Questioned</p>
<p>Cheli's attitude was still calm, and he answered every question, but he answered slowly and in a very low voice. He briefly stated that his acquaintance with Malai in the past was purely social in nature and there was no business relationship. Before August 1st, he had met Malai three times. As for Yu Shengxiao, he had met him at 9:30 a.m. on August 1st, when he entrusted him to exchange US$86 for legal tender. At 11:45 a.m., he met Yu again to hand over the legal tender. Then, the questioning turned to the murder case on August 1st. The prosecutor presented an important piece of evidence: Cheli's felt hat. It was said that when he went out in a car with Yu Shengxiao that day, Malai was wearing civilian clothes and borrowed Cheli's hat. Cheli admitted in court that the felt hat was his, and that Malai borrowed it in the afternoon and returned it at 7:20 p.m. That evening. At this time, the defendant's defender examined the felt hat and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Don't Kill Me, Don't Kill Me"</p>
<p>At this point, the prosecutor then asked in detail about the scene of the bloody incident, and Cheli's answers were roughly the same as those he had provided in our court. According to him, he was driving and sitting in the front seat, while Malai and Yu Shengxiao were sitting in the back seat. In the middle of the journey, he suddenly heard a gunshot, followed by Yu shouting, "Don't kill me, don't kill me! I'll give you everything!" But Malai eventually shot Yu dead, pushed him out of the car, and ordered Cheli to return to the city along the original route. At this time, the judges and prosecutors carefully checked the map in detail, and the prosecutor repeatedly questioned the road surface and the trees on both sides to seek verification. At 4:20 p.m., the questioning was completed, and Colonel Palmer announced a recess and that the trial would resume at 9:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Eight Witnesses to Be Questioned Today</p>
<p>After the court opens this morning, eight more witnesses will continue to be questioned, and then the final debate will be held. The court will then announce the adjournment. The judges will hold a secret vote to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. If he is not guilty, he will be publicly declared innocent. If he is guilty, he will be asked about his resume and past crimes before considering and deciding the sentence and then reopen the court for announcement, or keep it secret pending publication by higher authorities.</p>

<h3>Military Service Association Revises and Approves Standards for Levying Preferential Fees</h3>

<h3>Zhang Yi Should Give Instructions: Strive to Eliminate Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhang Yi, the president of National Fudan University, drove to Jiangwan Stadium yesterday morning at the invitation of Director Fang of the Municipal Party Department to give a pep talk to the conscripted soldiers passing through. He said: "After the victory of the War of Resistance, it is reasonable and logical to live in peace. The people who have suffered for eight years should be able to recuperate and live in peace and contentment. However, the Communist bandits are creating chaos, preventing the country from being unified and strong, and preventing the people from living in peace and contentment. Originally, a country can only have one government and one army. In other words, the country's political and military orders must be unified. However, the Communist bandits insist on establishing another government to compete with the National Government, organizing bandit troops in order to seize territory and claim hegemony, and colluding with foreign countries, acting as red traitors. Wherever they occupy, railways are demolished, traffic is cut off, goods cannot flow smoothly, and coal mines, ore factories, and plants are destroyed, resulting in the suspension of production. The former high-rise buildings have been burned down, leaving only rubble. The slightly wealthy have been 'liquidated' completely, and even their lives are difficult to protect. In short, the Communist bandits are shameless beasts in clothes. Unless they are eliminated, the soldiers cannot put down their guns for a single day. Only by eliminating the Communist bandits can the country be unified and strong, and you can all return home to live in peace and contentment. I hope that all comrades will do their best, fight bravely, and spare no sacrifice to eliminate the bandits and build a prosperous and happy new China." Zhang's speech lasted an hour, and his words were sincere and moving, and all who listened were inspired.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Temporarily Maintain Old Prices; Bureau Director Guarantees No Increase Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday, the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to do its best to temporarily maintain the prices of public utilities. At least for the first ten days of this month, it can be guaranteed that the prices will not change. If there are no new stimuli, then it is hoped that September can be spent stably. The most important of public utilities is electricity. The current electricity price has been decided to be temporarily maintained. Large companies have decided to temporarily allow them to sacrifice, and small companies that cannot bear the losses will find other ways to compensate. If electricity generation does not increase, then trams can also maintain their original prices, and public buses will also find ways to keep their prices unchanged. Currently, the most difficult problem is gas, because the allocation price has risen sharply, which has greatly affected costs. The Public Utilities Bureau is currently studying countermeasures, or slightly revising its charging methods.</p>

<h3>Li Ze's Suspicions of Being a Traitor: Two Key Points of Investigation; Whether Approval Was Obtained for Participation and What Specific Contributions Were Made</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The trial of the case against Li Ze, general manager of the New World Department Store, on suspicion of being a traitor, was held in the High Court yesterday afternoon. This was the twelfth hearing since the trial began. The focus of yesterday's investigation was: (1) Did he apply to the central government for approval in advance to serve as a member of the preparatory committee and director of the puppet Commercial Association? (2) What specific contributions did he make to the War of Resistance during his tenure in the puppet position? Li wore a light blue silk gown, black cloth round-toed shoes, and a folding fan in his hand. In response to the court's questioning, he stated: After receiving the notice from the puppet Ministry of Industry assigning him as a member of the preparatory committee of the puppet Commercial Association, he reported it to Huang Ruitang, the head of the Military Intelligence Bureau stationed in Shanghai, who forwarded it to the central government. Later, Huang informed him that it had been approved by the central government and showed him the telegram, which roughly stated, "Since this person has been assigned to counter-insurgency work and is protecting underground workers, he is allowed to take the puppet position and intensify counter-espionage work." However, this secret telegram could not be preserved under the circumstances at the time and was destroyed after reading. As for his contributions to the War of Resistance, such as economic assistance to underground workers, donating 77 million yuan in puppet currency to the National Salvation Army, facilitating the movement of underground workers, and reporting to the Military Intelligence Bureau that the enemy and puppets had decided to buy cotton cloth, he immediately reported this information to Chen Hao, a member of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai Direct Team. Li Ze requested Chen Hao to testify at the previous hearing, but Chen Hao did not appear in court yesterday. The court ordered a postponement of the trial, and Li Ze was still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Electric Fans: Contradictions Before and After</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] A staff member of the Executive Yuan sent another letter to City Councilor Zeng yesterday, expressing suspicion about the Financial Department of the Executive Yuan's recent request for the allocation of 400 electric fans to the United Committee and reported it to the City Council. The original letter stated: "The Material Purchase and Sales Department of the Financial Department of the Executive Yuan, due to the case of selling electric fans and being exposed for corruption and fraud, the Supervisory Department once sent personnel to the Executive Yuan to investigate and instructed the Executive Yuan not to use the inventory of materials until the details were clarified. However, recently the Financial Department of the Executive Yuan again requested the allocation of 400 electric fans to the United Committee. Since the electric fans have been notified to various agencies and groups as 'out of stock and difficult to handle,' why are there electric fans allocated to the United Committee? This measure is contradictory before and after and is difficult for people to understand."</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Official's Dereliction of Duty Case: Application for Judge's Recusal Rejected by Collegiate Bench</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] In the case of Health Bureau officials Chen Boyu and Zhu Kai for corruption and dereliction of duty, Judge Rao Zhengong of the District Court previously tried the case. Because Chen was at large, Zhu's detention was extended for two months. Defendant's lawyer Cheng Mengming believed that Judge Rao was biased and, in addition to applying for Judge Rao's recusal in court, also submitted a written application. The application was adjudicated by the collegiate bench consisting of Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu, Judge Mei Erhe, and Judge Wu Ronglin yesterday, and it was determined that the lawyer's reasons for the application were insufficient and it was rejected. The original trial was still handled by Judge Rao. Chen Boyu, who was at large, was originally entrusted to Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei. According to a letter from the Health Bureau to the District Court, after Chen was released on bail, the bureau ordered him to find a reliable guarantor who could be held accountable. The District Court deemed its reasons to be insufficient and sent another letter to the Health Bureau to urge Chen Boyu to appear in court for interrogation in order to close the case.</p>
<h3>Bai Lu's Fatal Wound Confirmed to Be on the Head; Prosecutor Inspects Elevator; Believes Three Points Are Relevant</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Famous actress Du Xiaomu (stage name Bai Lu) fell into the bottom of the elevator when boarding the elevator at the International Hotel, causing serious injuries and death. Yesterday morning, the body was placed in the morgue on Changde Road. At around 10 a.m., the District Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Fang Zheng, forensic doctor Gong Ziwei, and Shen Dajun to inspect the body. It was found that Du had a severe wound on her temple and injuries on both knees. The fatal injury was the wound on her temple. Jiang Junchao's brother and Du's brother were present during the autopsy. At around 2 p.m., Prosecutor Fang returned to the International Hotel to inspect the elevator. His investigation results showed that three points were related to the case: (1) The elevator speed of the hotel was higher than normal, (2) When the elevator was preparing to ascend, the outside iron door could still be pushed open by hand, (3) With so many people entering and leaving the hotel, why was there no attendant outside the elevator to take care of safety? After the autopsy was completed, Du's body was moved to the China Funeral Home, and people from the film and theater industry visited in an endless stream. Famous director Cai Chusheng went despite his illness, and others such as Shi Dongzhong, Pan Zienong, Lan Ma, and Feng Zi also went to pay their respects. The theater industry expressed great indignation at this and specially hired lawyers Jiang Yong and Zhou Hongguang to handle the case and will file a lawsuit against the person in charge of the hotel for negligent homicide. (Another report) It has been reported that a foreign female passenger fell into the bottom of the elevator and died from her injuries. It is now learned that the female passenger, Mrs. Jiang (i.e., Du Xiaomu), resided in Room 608 of the hotel. At around 10 a.m. on August 31st, she returned from outside, wearing sunglasses, and hurried into the store. Just as Elevator No. 3 was closing the outer door and rising from the bottom floor, the female passenger suddenly reached into the door with her hand, trying to push it open and rush in, causing her to lose her footing. At that time, the store attendant shouted to stop her, but it was too late. Afterwards, the police sent someone to inspect the elevator and found no flaws. Because the hotel's elevator is the most beautiful in the Far East, each elevator has eight steel ropes and is extremely safe. It was unexpected that someone would automatically push the door and squeeze in and fall down. Some say that the female passenger, wearing sunglasses, rushed in hastily and could not see clearly, which was one of the causes of the accident. It is also heard that the female passenger was returning from seeing a doctor for her illness, and her spirit may have been very unhealthy, which may have been another cause of the accident.</p>

<h3>Fire on Zhonghua Road; Ladder Collapses Due to Crowding; Firefighter Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] At 9:10 p.m. last night, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the Taoyuan Barber Shop opened by Sun Libao at 1264 Zhonghua Road (Anlan Road intersection) in Nanshi. The fire spread quickly, and the pump trucks of various fire departments worked hard to extinguish it. As a result, two rooms on the upper floor were burned down. At that time, a ladder truck from the Western District Fire Department, about 50 feet high, collapsed due to the collapse of the leg supports due to excessive crowding by the audience below when firefighter Jiang Chenglong held the belt and climbed up to rescue, and Jiang also fell to the ground and was injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. It is hoped that the police authorities will send more police officers to the scene to maintain order in the event of a fire in the future to avoid repeating the same mistake.</p>

<h3>Aibei New Coal Capital: New, Fame Not as Great as Fushun, Hopes More Than Fushun</h3>
<p>— Shenyang August 28th Air Dispatch, Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee, Mr. Sun Yueqi, along with several mining experts, arrived at Zaoxin Coal Mine on the 26th of the month for inspection. The reporter also accompanied them. They arrived at the eastern edge of Rehe. The northern autumn is refreshing, and the wind and rain are unpredictable. Fuxin's environment is just like the weather, seeking production amidst instability, having experienced several risks in the past two years.</p>
<p>Fuxin is a new mine. Its fame is far less than Fushun's, but its hopes are much greater than Fushun's. Fushun is almost in a state of "empty old mountains." It is said that it can still be "rejuvenated," but the huge cost involved is simply beyond reach in today's situation. Fuxin is different. It is a sapling, growing vigorously. After the Battle of Siping, the coal mines in Northeast China suffered huge losses. In fact, Fuxin has become the new coal capital of Northeast China.</p>
<p>In the later stages of the Japanese war of aggression, due to the extreme shortage of oil, research on refining oil from Fuxin coal was successful, and an oil refining factory was established in Mianxi, with a planned monthly output of 30,000 tons of oil. Unfortunately, the installation was not fully completed when Japan surrendered. According to a Japanese geologist retained by Zaoxin, "Jinxi has already extracted oil, but the production figures are unknown due to military secrets." Japan actively developed this treasure trove after the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>The Fuxin coal seam was formed during the Jurassic period, and the coal quality is superior. The only drawback is that it cannot be used for coking. Its reserves are greater than those of Fushun. According to Japanese estimates, it is 1.24 billion tons. Another theory puts it at over 3 billion tons, but this has not been confirmed by drilling. Because the coal seam is continuously formed, there are three coalfields: Fuxin, Zhangwu, and Badaohao. Fuxin is the largest. Currently, only Fuxin and a part of the northern area of Badaohao are being mined. The Zhangwu coalfield has not yet been developed.</p>
<p>Fuxin has a total of six mines, namely Xinqiu, Gaode, Taiping, Sunjiawan, Wulong, and Ping'an. Within twelve hours, we visited the Xinqiu, Taiping, and Sunjiawan mines, as well as the coal preparation plant and the main machinery plant. Sunjiawan's</p>
<p>open-pit mining produces 1,500 tons per day. Xinqiu's open-pit mining is currently stripping the soil. The six mines have a total of 38 inclined shafts. We spent two hours visiting one inclined shaft of the Taiping Branch. Guided by two young engineers, we went 400 meters underground to explore the underground storage and the laborers living in the stratum. Each of us changed into new mining clothes, gray cloth clothes and trousers, rubber-soled shoes, carrying a stick in our hands, and wearing a "steel helmet" woven from willow branches on our heads, with a carbide lamp attached to it. The team of a dozen people looked like a fire dragon, walking down step by step. The engineer guiding me and I walked at the front. After entering 100 meters below the surface, there were no longer any pit wood supports, only a few supports at the most dangerous places. I was uneasy in my heart and asked, "Isn't this dangerous?" The engineer answered calmly, "It is dangerous, but there is a lack of pit wood, and there is no way around it. We are very careful. Since taking over, there hasn't been a single unfortunate incident." His words reassured me. After entering the mine, I believed that the engineer's words were power. Probably the first person to enter the mine would be worried.</p>
<p>We arrived at</p>
<p>a corner 400 meters below the surface, and there were still 200 meters below. We saw workers using electric drills and explosives to attack the mine. I admired them as the greatest of mankind. This uses a small contracting system, where workers pay for their labor and receive one share of the reward. But contracting is not a reasonable system, and workers may be threatened by illness. The mine answered this question by saying, "If a worker is sick for a short period of time, wages are paid according to the usual standard of income. If they are sick for more than a month, two-thirds of the wages are paid." It is said that workers can receive death benefits, a public fund employee mutual assistance life insurance, and four types of guarantees from the Resource Committee's insurance office. If a worker unfortunately dies, the living expenses of his family for five years are not a problem. Under the current social environment and work management, only this.</p>
<p>The small contracting system is the best system for maintaining work efficiency. If we do not advocate a one-point profit and one-point money system, it is impossible to maintain work efficiency. The workers' knowledge level is very low. Eighty percent of the workers are illiterate. They can earn an average of about 1,200 yuan per day. Sorghum rice sells for 300 yuan per catty, and life is very difficult. Most of them are from Shandong and Hebei, leaving their suffering hometowns for ten or twenty years and coming to the "New World."</p>
<p>Security must be ensured before production can be discussed. The staff and workers of the Bixin Coal Mine all feel this way. They are threatened by the communists. There are small groups of communists operating twenty miles north of Fuxin. Therefore, a large number of important equipment is stored in Hanyang Jin Yizhou, and they dare not transport it until security is no longer a problem. The families of the staff live in Tianjin. Mr. Sun Yueqi said, "This is an expensive method. On the one hand, we have to eat, and on the other hand, we have to guard against thieves." Secondly, tight funds and lack of electricity, timber, and food are all important factors that shrink production.</p>
<p>The Fuxin coal mine has been reorganized for more than a year since its receipt in 1946 and has restored one-third of its original production.</p>
<h3>Huainan Salt Administration Officially Reorganized and Established Yesterday: Ministry of Finance Appoints Gu Jianzhong as Director</h3>

Mr. Gu passed through Zhenjiang today to take office in Yangzhou.</p>
<h3>Using Tree Branches as Weapons: Dacheng Hall Resembles a Fortress: Zheng Students' Brawl Becomes Serious</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 29th] On Teachers' Day here, a dispute arose between students from the county normal school and students from Anyang who had fled to Zhengzhou over the use of the Dacheng Hall. Negotiations over the past two days have been ineffective, and conflicts have resumed. One Anyang student was beaten, and the situation is trending towards becoming complicated. When the Anyang students who had fled to Zhengzhou returned to stay overnight at the Dacheng Hall on the 28th evening, they unexpectedly found that the gate to the Dacheng Hall had been locked. This led to another quarrel with the students from the county normal school. The two sides fought for a while, and Wang Derong, an Anyang student staying at the Zheng County Vocational School, also participated in the battle and was injured in the leg. The gate to the Dacheng Hall was naturally opened, and the Anyang students still stayed inside that night. However, that night, Wang Shaozeng, an Anyang student who came out to urinate, was also injured in the leg, but the injuries were not serious. Another Anyang student who came out to urinate, Wang Shaoxian, was lucky to have lost his shoes and was not beaten. They harbored resentment, and on the 29th, some Anyang students went to burn branches from trees in the school as firewood, which led to another conflict. The incident started at 4:00 PM. The students from the county normal school took the Boy Scout sticks as weapons and occupied the front yard. The Anyang students took tree branches and firewood as weapons and used the Dacheng Hall as their base. The students from the county normal school could not enter, and the Anyang students could not come out. More than 200 people on each side faced each other sternly. Police Chief Song Zengyun, County Head Gao Anlun, Anyang Councilor Chairman Tian Gengli, as well as several school principals and teachers, originally went to mediate, but for some reason, the mediators did not get along. One said, "Let's say it's our Zhengzhou's fault for offending the guests," and the other said, "Let's say it's our fault for being driven to Zhengzhou by the communists." Later, the words of both sides became increasingly unpleasant, and the mediators also took the sides of the parties involved. Fortunately, the situation did not escalate into a fight because the county head ordered the teachers and students of the county normal school to withdraw completely. By this time, it was already after 7:00 PM. However, both sides are now holding meetings, and it seems that they are both taking further actions. It is also heard that the teacher surnamed Liang, who led the Anyang students to use force last time, has been arrested. This happened before the incident on the 29th.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper, Suzhou, 2nd] The Suzhou Journalists' Association previously publicly solicited members, with an admission fee of 30,000 yuan per person. A total of 68 applications for new member registration were received, but the results of the review showed that only 7 people qualified, 9 people needed to submit supplementary documents for re-examination, and the remaining 52 people were all rejected on the grounds that they did not meet the provisions of Article 3 of the Journalists Law. It is learned that the 52 rejected people believe that Article 3 of the Journalists Law stipulates the qualifications for obtaining a certificate. Joining the association has other regulations in the constitution, which stipulate that all current journalists should join as members. Therefore, this review seems to be a distortion of the law, the result of excluding dissidents, and difficult to convince. Now, the entire group has jointly telegraphed the National Government's various ministries, provincial government's various departments, party headquarters at all levels, and colleagues across the country to appeal for justice, and has submitted a request to the Suzhou County Government for legal relief.</p>

<h3>Guo Youshou Hosted Capital Reporters Yesterday, Elaborating on the Importance of Basic Education in Churches; Huxley's Letter Expressed Admiration for Our Country's Literary and Educational Contributions</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 2nd] The Chinese government, in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is convening the Far East Regional Basic Education Research Conference, scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m. on the 3rd at the Academia Sinica on Beijige, Nanjing. Among the twelve participating units, all representatives are expected to attend on time, except for those from Pakistan and the Philippines who have not yet arrived in Nanjing. Dr. Guo Youshou, Director of the Education Department of UNESCO, Dr. Rawson (Head of the Department of Social Education at the University of London), and Professor Eguilan, a representative of the Mexican Ministry of Education, arrived in Nanjing a few days ago. They will join Dr. Hubbard, a social education expert from Ping and Nanjing, to represent UNESCO at the conference. At a press conference held at the Ministry of Education at 5:30 p.m. on the 2nd, Guo and others explained the upcoming conference, stating that basic education is UNESCO's most important work. More than half of the world's population still cannot read, and educational opportunities are excessively unequal, which is detrimental to world peace. Therefore, the first UNESCO General Conference last winter and the UNESCO Standing Committee this spring successively decided that basic education is one of the three major priority programs to be particularly emphasized this year. Plans were drawn up to hold regional basic education research conferences in China and Mexico, and to implement "demonstration designs" in China, Haiti, British East Africa, and the Amazon River Basin. During the Chinese War of Resistance, special attention was given to basic education, and great progress has been made in recent years. Therefore, holding a regional research conference in our country's capital can allow the participating representatives to understand and value the new concepts and experiments contributed by China in basic education methods and approaches.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Basic Education Conference</p>
<p>The purpose of the Basic Education Conference is to emphasize both academic and technical aspects, collect data, exchange opinions, engage with facts, and formulate comprehensive and feasible methods for promoting basic education and demonstration designs, so as to submit recommendations to the second UNESCO General Conference to be held in Mexico City in November this year. The regional conference to be held in Mexico will coincide with the second UNESCO General Conference. Professor Eguilan is here to collect reference materials. Guo also mentioned that Dr. Huxley, Director-General of UNESCO, has always been extremely concerned about China's cultural and educational affairs. This time, he entrusted him to bring letters to President Chiang, President Zhang, Minister Zhu, Foreign Minister Wang, and figures in China's educational, scientific, and cultural circles, expressing admiration for China's cultural and educational contributions and extending condolences to Chinese cultural and educational workers. He also plans to visit China in 1950. After attending this conference, Guo and others will leave here for France before the 20th, stopping briefly in India and Egypt along the way to connect with cultural and educational figures in those places. They are expected to return to Paris in early October and then go to Mexico City at the end of the month to attend the second UNESCO General Conference.</p>

<h3>Adjustment of the Exchange Rate for US Dollars and Gold - Calculated According to the Foreign Exchange Listing - 3% Handling Fee for US Dollar Receipts - US$40 per tael of Gold</h3>
<p>Regarding the exchange rate for US dollar cash, the previous method has been changed to a foreign exchange method, and the previously set price should be adjusted urgently. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has now stipulated the following methods, notifying the Central Bank to follow:</p>
<p>(1) US dollar cash may be exchanged at the US dollar foreign exchange market price (the Central Bank's foreign exchange stabilization fund exchange rate), and a 3% handling fee may be charged (the handling fee should be calculated on a per-transaction basis, rounded off to the nearest hundred yuan in national currency).</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the Central Bank's own exchange, it has entrusted the China, Jiaotong, Citibank, and Chase banks to handle the exchange matters on its behalf.</p>
<p>As for the exchange rate for gold, the Ministry of Finance has also been authorized by telegram to exchange pure gold at US$41 per tael according to the original rate set by the Central Bank. The conversion rate shall be calculated by converting it into national currency according to the US dollar exchange rate. For example, according to the US dollar exchange rate of 38,500 on September 2, each tael is converted into 1,540,000 yuan in national currency ((38,500 x 40 = 1,540,000).</p>
<p>The above two methods will be implemented from September 3rd. Legitimate merchants holding US dollars and gold can go to exchange them according to the above regulations. As for the measures to crack down on gold speculation and prohibit the circulation of foreign currency banknotes, they should be strictly implemented in accordance with the resolutions of the State Council. Those who violate the law and engage in the purchase and sale of gold and US dollars will be severely punished by the government according to law.</p>

<p>2.  The foreign exchange obtained from the export of consignment goods should be settled at the market price on the last day of the period for each item of goods if it is paid or sold outside the prescribed time limit. If the market price has not been announced on that day, the foreign exchange for the goods should be settled at the official price of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Regarding newly exported consignment goods, that is, those shipped on and after August 16, 1947, they should be handled in accordance with the following articles:</p>
<p>1.

<h3>Cotton Mills Purchasing Cotton as Collateral - Each Mill Handles Individually</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The members of the Spinning and Adjustment Committee held a temporary meeting at President Zhang of the Central Bank's residence yesterday evening. Minister Chen of the Ministry also attended. After discussion, the following decisions were made: (1) The Central Bank agrees to provide mortgage loans for each cotton mill's purchase of raw cotton, and each mill handles it individually. (2) The processing fee for each piece of cotton yarn spun by each mill is temporarily set at 4 million yuan. (3) Export issues: Private cotton mills hope to participate in the export of yarn and cloth and join the yarn and cloth export review group of the Import and Export Management Committee. The principle is agreed, but the method will be calculated separately.</p>
<h3>Compilation and Publication of Cotton Yarn Allocation Statistics</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to statistics released by the Compilation and Adjustment Committee: since its establishment on July 1st, up to August 29th, the committee has allocated and sold a total of 59,553 bales of cotton yarn (equivalent to 20-count yarn). During the same period, the China Textile Construction Corporation allocated and sold 40,447 bales of cotton yarn (equivalent to 20-count yarn), of which 31,867 bales were sold locally and 8,580 bales were sold to other regions. Private factories allocated and sold 19,106 bales of cotton yarn (equivalent to 20-count yarn).</p>
<p>Furthermore, a responsible person from the committee stated that the committee's business policy prioritizes the regulation of yarn and cloth. A bumper harvest of new cotton is expected this year, and the electricity problem is expected to be alleviated as a result of discussions convened by the authorities with all relevant parties. Therefore, it is expected that the production cost of yarn and cloth can be reduced in the future. In that case, the regulation of yarn and cloth will also be easier to implement, he said.</p>

<h3>Opening Trade of Silkworm Eggs with Japan, Jiangsu Silkworm Merchants Telegraph Request to Stop</h3>
<p>The silkworm industry in our country is centered in Jiangsu Province. Recently, with the "opening of trade with Japan," Japan has listed 175,000 boxes of silkworm eggs for export. Ma Fanqu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Silkworm Egg Industry Association, and various leaders, including Shen Pei, gathered to discuss countermeasures and decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan to strictly prohibit this.</p>
<h3>Three Principles Agreed Upon, U.S. Dollar Treasury Bills to be Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the issue of continuing to issue 36-year short-term treasury bills at the foreign exchange market price, Deputy Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance, Director Chen of the Public Debt Department, and relevant parties have been discussing the matter for days and have now formulated a plan, deciding on three principles: (1) Simplify the subscription procedures; (2) Centralize the subscription locations; and (3) Limit the remittance of subscription funds in each location to the same day. Therefore, short-term treasury bills will be issued centrally by the Central Bank and its branches in various locations. The plan was taken to the capital by Deputy Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance last night and will be implemented as soon as it is approved by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Discount Committee's Loans Due, One Loan Recalled and Not Renewed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held a routine meeting on the 1st, approving 24 applications totaling 5.006 billion yuan. It is reported that 27 loan applications totaling 5.999 billion yuan, which were approved at the 21st meeting, have not been released due to the notice from the Four Banks Joint Office to temporarily suspend lending. The loans can now be issued after being submitted to President Zhang for approval.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The committee has decided to recall all loans upon maturity and not renew them. If a new application is submitted after the loan is recalled, it will be approved based on the applicant factory's production and sales performance during the loan period. Therefore, the committee has already recovered 5.7 billion yuan of various loans that matured in August, and the 12 billion yuan of loans that will mature in September will also be recovered on schedule, it is said.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Mill Association, Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors, Resolved to Hold the Second Member Congress in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 22nd joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Cotton Mill Association was held at 4:00 PM on the 1st in the meeting room of the China Textile Construction Corporation. Chairman Dong Yinzhang presided over the meeting. The important resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The association previously requested to send two representatives to participate in the National Economic Commission. The commission replied that the organization had been established and could not be widely extended. In the future, if there are small group meetings to discuss the textile industry, representatives will be invited to participate. As the commission is currently reviewing the yarn and cloth regulation plan, the association decided to request that representatives be sent to participate.</p>
<p>(2) The association's second member congress is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month. The original plan was for each district to send one member representative for every 1,000 spindles, which would result in too many people. It has now been decided to change the plan to use district associations as the unit, with one representative for every 10,000 spindles up to 100,000 spindles, and one representative for every 30,000 spindles above 100,000 spindles. Thread spindles will be calculated in the same way as yarn spindles, with each automatic loom counted as 20 spindles and each ordinary loom counted as 15 spindles. According to this calculation, the total number of representatives sent by district associations will be around 180. The above plan will be implemented after consulting with the district associations.</p>
<p>(3) The second member congress plans to put forward a textile industry revitalization plan, which will be implemented step by step after being approved by the congress. The plan will also expand publicity to promote the textile industry's important position in China's industry, it is said.</p>
<h3>Bulls and Bears Equally Matched, Not Much Movement in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday had a reaction from retail investors. They were initially pessimistic. The market showed signs of resisting a fall. The bulls, such as One-Five-Down Number, etc., added to their positions. In addition, the overnight interest rate opened low at 1 jiao and 1 jiao 9.5 fen, and credit eased, reviving buying sentiment. However, the bears still exerted pressure, and high prices were difficult to sustain. Near the close, the bulls and bears fought fiercely.</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the huge volume of interbank exchange transactions, the market inevitably felt tired. After the opening of Di Yongsha, the market was slightly stabilized with the support of retail bulls. Numbers 152 and 94 rose to 246 yuan, but due to the disposal of stock by Number 105, etc., they retreated to 242 yuan. Numbers 218 and Xinzhe, etc., purchased stock, causing a rebound to 249 yuan. Numbers 2335 and others slightly supplied stock, causing a retreat to 245 yuan.</p>
<p>After 10:30 AM, credit eased, and the overnight interest rate opened low at 1 jiao and 1 jiao 9.5 fen, boosting confidence. Numbers 223, etc., added to their positions. Number 22 even bought Di Yongsha. Rumors also circulated that two major officials were resigning, causing a gradual rebound to 254 yuan. Numbers 218, etc., sold at high prices, and Number 67 supplied Di Yongsha, causing a retreat to 246 yuan. Near the close, the bulls made a full effort to push up the market. Number 223, etc., vigorously purchased stock, and Number 152 even fiercely purchased Di Yongsha, causing the market to rebound to 1147 yuan and close at 251 yuan.</p>
<p>Bids were slightly lower after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, the current delivery stocks Di Yongsha, Xinnuo, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xinguang slightly increased. Yonggong, Jingfu, and Zhongfa slightly decreased. Xinhua was unchanged. Qinxing fell by half a percent. Zhongsi was unchanged. Zhongfang, Tongyi, Datong, and Jinglun slightly decreased. Rongfeng, Shangwu, Yingan, and Neiyi slightly increased. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Jingfu and Qinxing slightly declined. Di Yongsha, Xinnuo, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xinguang slightly increased. Off-market old stocks remained relatively stable.</p>

<h3>Autumn Cocoon Loan Measures, Manufacturers Unwilling to Accept</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The silk reeling associations of the three districts convened an emergency meeting and telegraphed a request to implement the joint cocoon and silk production and sales plan. After the Four Banks Joint Office agreed on this year's autumn cocoon purchase loan measures, the silk reeling associations of the three districts felt that the measures were inconsistent with the general outline of the government's announced cocoon and silk production and sales plan for this year and were difficult to accept. Moreover, the time for the arrival of autumn cocoons is approaching, leaving little time for back-and-forth consultations. Therefore, it was resolved to telegraph the Four Banks Joint Office to continue to handle the matter in accordance with the original cocoon and silk production and sales outline to avoid difficulties for both factories and farmers, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions opened steadily, but soon the market became overwhelmed with speculation due to the large-scale sale of textiles by the Fangjian Company the previous day. The actual sales were sluggish, and the money market remained tight, leading to market nervousness. The market subsequently declined. In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by another 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with a low of 18.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was dull and weak. Business in the local market and shops remained sluggish, and the appetite of customers from other regions was also flagging. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was down by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, at 480,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market conditions were stable. Yarn factories' demand turned strong, and yarn factories from other regions also increased their purchases. Transactions turned brisk. Prices were neither high nor low, and the footing showed a firm trend. Total daily transactions were around 1,100 bales.</p>
<h3>Rayon Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market conditions were firm and stable. As a result, prices were up by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The last bid price for 120-count Jin Sanma and Xuzi Youguang in the afternoon was 26.4 million yuan. The factory was quiet, and there were few inquiries for all grades of Wudan head. Bid prices softened accordingly, down by an average of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Qianjing was worried about sluggish sales, and bid prices for all goods were lowered. The silk market was tight yesterday due to the tight credit situation of those in the industry. Various parties were selling off their holdings, so the opening price for true silk quilts was down slightly, and the price of Huaqiang goods was expected to decline. The market price of Dacheng goods was similar. The bid price for Gezi Jianzhou was down by 500 yuan, but there were still few transactions. The firmness or weakness of other goods varied.</p>
<h3>Rice Continues Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 11,300 shih of rice arrived in the north and south markets. Digestion was sluggish, and the market continued to decline. Japonica rice stepped down by 10,000 yuan. Indica rice fell by over 10,000 yuan again. New japonica rice was also down by 10,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan both fell by 3-5,000 yuan. Flour was allocated and sold as usual, and the price was unchanged. Miscellaneous flour was average, and unified flour was weak by 1,000 yuan. The price of bran in large packages was stable, while the price of bran in small packages soared by over 2,000 yuan due to brisk sales in Zhejiang. Sales of soybean cakes were average, and the price did not increase. The market for yellow soybeans opened weak, but oil factories strengthened their demand at noon, turning the market from weak to stable. As a result, there was little change.</p>
<p>Qin Dao Coal Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hailiao wheel returned to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao yesterday, transporting 2,400 tons of coal, which is currently berthed at the Qin Xing North Line in Yiqin for unloading.</p>
<p>Cigarette Sales Still Good</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market opened slightly higher. Demand in the local market was not quiet, and sales were good. Prices turned firm. As a result, 10-cigarette packs of British American Tobacco rebounded to 14.7 million yuan, up by 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Chinese cigarettes such as the Meili brand were up by 501 to over 1,001 yuan.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Disputes in Old-Style Marriages</h3>
<p>[Xu Neng Asks] My cousin, Mr. Jia, is 22 years old. Two years ago, his parents arranged a marriage for him with Ms. Yi. Although he expressed dissatisfaction at the time, he did not strongly object due to economic constraints and circumstances. Last year, Mr. Jia met Ms. Bing while studying in Shanghai. They fell in love at first sight and vowed to be together forever. They are now living together. Ms. Bing has repeatedly urged Mr. Jia to marry her, but he is hesitant because his marriage contract with Ms. Yi has not been dissolved. Mr. Jia has raised the issue of denying the marriage contract with his family, but has not been able to fulfill his wishes due to the constraints of old ethics. Now, in order to resolve the matter urgently, he has several questions to ask your lawyer for guidance so he can follow the law. (1) Is a marriage contract arranged by parents without the consent of the person himself valid? (2) From a legal point of view, can Mr. Jia unilaterally publish a denial of the marriage contract in the newspaper? (3) If Mr. Jia proposes to terminate the contract, can Ms. Yi demand compensation for losses from Mr. Jia? (4) Mr. Jia is already living with Ms. Bing. If Ms. Yi finds out, can she sue Mr. Jia or Ms. Bing for bigamy or interfering with marriage?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, "A marriage contract shall be entered into by the man and woman themselves." Since this marriage contract was not obtained with the consent of the person concerned, it is invalid. (2) Publishing a denial in the newspaper is certainly permissible, but since the marriage contract is invalid, publishing it or not is not necessary. (3) Since the marriage contract is invalid, Ms. Yi has no right to make any demands. (4) Since Mr. Jia and Ms. Yi are not married, Mr. Jia and Ms. Bing's marriage does not constitute bigamy.</p>
<h3>Readers' Letters</h3>
<p>To Zhao Zisheng of Wuxi: The symptoms you described are quite similar to "Lou Ma Si." You should seek medical treatment. When sleeping at night, avoid getting cold to prevent the condition from worsening. The prescription for medication must be determined after a doctor's diagnosis. You are over fifty years old, so pay attention to whether your blood pressure is too high.</p>
<p>To Zhou Dawei of Shanghai: I have received your letter. Your illness is likely "Gangrene." You should seek treatment from a pulmonologist as soon as possible and do not delay.</p>
<p>To Huang Kezhi of Shanghai: Your son's illness was originally only early-stage lung disease. If he had received appropriate treatment in time, he should have recovered long ago. However, one mistake led to another, not only deepening his lung disease but also causing other illnesses. Over the years, he has been indiscriminately treated with Chinese and Western medicine, which was a mistake. If there is no lung or internal medicine doctor with both scholarship and wealth in the countryside or nearby cities, it is always more hopeful to seek treatment in Shanghai, because Shanghai is not short of famous doctors, and the equipment of major hospitals is quite complete. It is inevitable to scratch an itch through boots when communicating about illness by letter, and it is also a slow solution to an urgent problem. The so-called cure after taking medicine requires first determining the location of the disease before prescribing targeted treatment.</p>
<p>To Pei Jun of Shanghai: I have received your letter. Please discuss it directly with a specialist doctor.</p>
<p>To Li Ping of Shanghai: I have received your letter. Please inquire directly with the Shanghai Cixi Road No. 25 Doctors Association, which will transfer your letter to the New Medicine and New Drug Society.</p>
<p>To Chen Liming of Shanghai: You should first normalize your bowel movements. As for how to treat it, please consult a doctor and decide.</p>

<h3>Sent from Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>××:</p>
<p>I dare say, you would never have imagined that I would suddenly send you a letter from Qingdao.</p>
<p>Really, my decision was too "sudden." Three days before leaving, even I couldn't "imagine" it. It was like this: My father stayed in Shanghai for two weeks, affording me a little bit of familial joy, and then he left again. This stirred up a heart full of sorrow for parting! Just at this moment of utter boredom, a sudden opportunity lured me to have a sudden idea – to travel? Yes! Traveling can dispel troubled moods and thoughts – therefore, I suddenly flew away!</p>
<p>Now, as I write this letter, I have suddenly decided that tomorrow I will fly to another place. I have developed a strong interest in "suddenness." I am very pleased with this unplanned, unconstrained, free, and unrestrained action! I have pondered: If I could spend my whole life flying east, flying west, flying south, flying north, like a bird without a nest, how wonderful!</p>
<p>I have gained a lot in Qingdao (of course, all spiritual gains). Up until yesterday, I finished the ends of two long novels. I worked so diligently and enthusiastically. My literary inspiration seemed to have been filtered by the seawater, flowing so smoothly and unhindered! Unlike in Shanghai, where I worked so tiredly, so painfully, with so much resentment and hatred! At the same time, my body and mood are much better. All day long, I breathe fresh air that is ten thousand times better than artificial vitamin pills; I bask in gentle but not strong sunlight; I roam in the realm of nature; and I enjoy boundless tranquility and boundless peace. Do you think there is any reason why I should not be healthy and happy?</p>
<p>Since Qingdao is so good, I can't help but write a few words to praise her before I leave, to introduce you to this northern mountain city surrounded by water on three sides and bordering land on one side (i.e., the Jiaoji Railway, which is currently under contention).</p>
<p>I don't remember in whose book Qingdao was praised as the Switzerland of China. I have never been to Switzerland, so I dare not blindly agree. But to say that Qingdao is one of the most beautiful and artistic places in China is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Let's start with the scenery of Qingdao – the sea window, draped with a turquoise blue gauze curtain, opens wide on three sides between heaven and earth, embracing a green mountain city, with countless red-roofed foreign houses dotting a green expanse, looking from afar like blooming peach blossoms or plum blossoms! Can you say that this is not the most elegant, most poetic, and most beautiful painting?</p>
<p>Then there is the climate of Qingdao – in the hot and humid summer, if your heart is very calm and your actions are not too hasty, then you can spend the whole day without sweating, and you still need to cover yourself with a towel blanket at night. Whether it is day or night, a cool sea breeze is constantly blowing. So I think this is the best place to escape the summer heat, unlike Guling, Emei, where after reaching the summit, you have to wear a lined robe and even use a brazier (Emei is like that). According to a person who has lived in Qingdao for a long time, a wool coat is enough to keep warm in winter. Then isn't it always spring and autumn here throughout the year?</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly talk about the social situation of Qingdao based on a little superficial impression from my pilgrimage – it is an international city, so it has a mixed Sino-Western atmosphere. For example, the architecture is absolutely Europeanized and modern. You can't find a single old Chinese bungalow; even the toilets are Western-style. In this way, it appears very neat and beautiful. Almost every family has a small courtyard, where you can plant flowers and grass. Unlike Shanghai, where each lane house has at most a small patch of open space the size of a palm. Garden houses are of course also available, but only a few people live in them. The commerce here seems very sluggish, and there are both Chinese and Western businesses. On half a street similar to Avenue Joffre in Shanghai, there are many foreign-owned shops, but they sell fewer foreign goods and more antiques from Beiping. There are also many antique shops run by Chinese. There are few bookstores. There is a hospital on almost every street, which I don't quite understand. How can the medical industry be so developed in a place that is not easy to get sick? There are many Western restaurants and cafes, but very few Chinese restaurants. There are many tea shops, but no teahouses. A high-class large cafe on the beach has a dance floor and a foreign band. However, the dancers are not active. There are also several cafes with dance floors in the city, which are facilities for American sailors, with singers and dancers. The roads are like those in Chongqing, sometimes high and sometimes low, but they are very smooth and clean. Naturally, there are some corners where you can't help but see some garbage and dung. But on the whole, it is clean. Both large and small roads are planted with sycamore trees and poplars, which have already formed shade. Transportation is convenient, with buses, small jeep cars (picking up passengers along the way), and machine rickshaws. Except on the beach where you can meet some modern Chinese and Western men and women, on the sidewalks in the city, you only see simple and honest northern locals coming and going. Most of the women still wear half-length tops and trousers that cover their feet. Some of them have their hair tied in buns, which is not very harmonious with the situation on the beach. However, in my opinion, maintaining these many simple northern flavors is not too unsightly. Regarding the customs here, I encountered a local funeral once. In the front was a monotonous and emotionless band playing funeral music, all dressed in red and green. Then came two sedan chairs, open and empty. Seeing this, I thought it was a wedding! But then came the filial sons wearing hemp and mourning clothes, and finally a coffin covered with a brocade shroud. This was indeed the first time I had seen this, so I was very curious. Regarding the human feelings here, they are much thicker than in the South. If you go to a shop run by locals to buy something, they will treat you as a guest. They will greet you when you come and see you off when you leave. Even if you have bothered them for a long time and haven't bought anything, they will never utter a word and will still be very polite. There is not much exaggeration in bargaining. If you go to a restaurant and spend thirty to fifty thousand yuan, you only give a small tip of about one thousand yuan, and they all shout "Thank you." (This trend is almost the same in various parts of the North.) Now it is time to mention the education and culture here. I learned from a friend that it is quite depressed. One university is the National Shandong University, which was destroyed during the war. After the war, President Zhao Taiyou came back to revive it. The results are not bad, with three colleges: medicine, science, and literature. A few famous professors are invited, such as Ding Xilin, Lu Kanru, and Feng Yuanjun. However, the school buildings and equipment are not very well-equipped, because it is equivalent to a new creation. There are many difficulties, and it will take some time to perfect it. The other primary and secondary schools are also not very prosperous. The news industry may be more developed. There are many newspapers and news agencies. There are also several publications, mostly literary. The content is rather poor. The circulation is not very good, and it is greatly affected by Shanghai newspapers and yellow publications. In terms of entertainment, there are occasional amateur performances of dramas. Currently, a Shanghai theater troupe is here to make a quick profit. I don't know how the results are. Peking opera performances in the Shanghai style are extremely popular. Three out of four movie theaters show Chinese films. The several parks are as ordinary as parks everywhere. On the whole, Qingdao is in progress. The situation in the market is also stable. It doesn't seem as terrifying as the rumors outside for a while. You can't smell any gunpowder smoke, only occasionally a few sounds of toy guns from American children at night.</p>
<p>Above, I have sketched Qingdao so hastily. I don't know if it will give you a lovable concept? I don't care! Anyway, I love Qingdao, everything about Qingdao, especially the scenery, climate, and human feelings! How much I hate Shanghai! That hustle and bustle, that chaos, that heat, that cunning, that coldness!</p>
<p>These days, I have hardly seen any friends (and there are very few friends). Besides writing, I go out for walks alone. Whether it is the beach, the mountains, the streets, or the alleys, I have been to them all. Whether it is a Western restaurant, a cafe, a dance hall, or a dumpling shop, I have sat in them all. I like to wander around aimlessly, especially in an unfamiliar place. People don't know me; I don't know people; I don't have to nod and greet people on the street; you can do whatever you want, no one cares about you, and no one pays attention to you. How free!</p>
<p>Others may feel that my life here is too lonely, and I can't say twenty words a day (because there is no one to talk to), and I would get sick from boredom! But I don't think so. On the contrary, the more people there are, the more lonely I feel. I love this loneliness, this loneliness immersed in the realm of nature – only in this loneliness can I touch my true self; only then can I feel boundless peace; only then can my spirit be comfortably liberated; only then can my emotions be leisurely sublimated; only then can my soul rest; only then can my heart be at peace!</p>
<p>I often want to sit in a seaside cafe, slowly drinking a glass of brandy, while looking up at the vast and boundless blue sea and thinking about the long and boundless past and future! (Of course, all are more pleasant things. I cast aside everything that would disturb me). I sit from dusk to sunset, from sunset to sunrise. I forget that I still live in a group society. I am dizzy and actually think that I live on a deserted island with only myself! If that's really the case, how good!</p>
<p>Okay! I will end here. I will write to you again when I get to a new place tomorrow. Blessings! (August 26)</p>
<p>By Alfred, Lord Tennyson:</p>
<p>Crossing the Bar - Translated by Zhen Le Shi</p>
<p>Sunset and evening star,</p>
<p>And one clear call for me!</p>
<p>And may there be no moaning of the bar,</p>
<p>When I put out to sea,</p>
<p>But such a tide as moving seems asleep,</p>
<p>Too full for sound and foam,</p>
<p>When that which drew from out the boundless deep</p>
<p>Turns again home.</p>
<p>Twilight and evening bell,</p>
<p>And after that the dark!</p>
<p>And may there be no sadness of farewell,</p>
<p>When I embark;</p>
<p>For though from out our bourne of Time and Place</p>
<p>The flood may bear me far,</p>
<p>I hope to see my Pilot face to face</p>
<p>When I have crossed the bar.</p>
<p>[Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a great poet of the Victorian era in England. For a detailed introduction, see "Chunqiu" in this newspaper on August 6, which will not be repeated. The poem above was written by Tennyson not long before his death. The "that which drew from out the boundless deep" mentioned in the second stanza refers to the poet himself, and "crossed the bar" means death. The poet compares the eternity of life and death to the "ocean" and "flood," and the "Pilot" in the last stanza refers to God. - Translator]</p>
<h3>Floating and Sinking - Sent to A Ye</h3>
<p>— Sang Mu</p>
<p>Saying that I wanted to lengthen my life, I came out of the small town and breathed in this corner of the ten-mile foreign concession. Strolling alone under the French parasol trees, I sometimes taste the meaning of life, but after filling my empty stomach, there is another kind of discomfort. There are many people coming and going on the road, but I still feel like I am in the Gobi Desert. Where are the green grass and springs?</p>
<p>"In order to chase the crumbs of bread, friendship is isolated."</p>
<p>So people will become haggard. Who says otherwise? In the cool breeze of dusk, I pluck the strings of my restless heart and play a lonely elegy to a distant friend, then listen carefully to the warm echo.</p>
<p>It came, trekking through thousands of mountains and rivers. The words on the cover are really much older. I like the scorched yellow earth paper, and I read it for another week. It was written by you, and it's like me again.</p>
<p>Even if you drink all the poisoned wine,</p>
<p>The present poverty is hard to bury.</p>
<p>Saying that the dagger can stop life,</p>
<p>It is also difficult to dye the sorrow of death.</p>
<p>If yesterday was a nightmare,</p>
<p>How can today continue to decorate warmth?</p>
<p>The mirage of many years ago,</p>
<p>Unable to touch the edge of memory.</p>
<p>But these short sentences composed of single words are the warmth of sympathy. No, my heart is even more desolate.</p>
<p>Time is in a long string of sadness, and time is really old. The life in the small town still remains in my mind. Boating on the lake, singing loudly with a glass of wine, telling each other's hearts knee to knee, listening to the boatman weaving an old story, the oldness of many years ago, is resurrected in my heart. I support the clouds in my heart with a toast, and laughter begins on the eve of farewell. After a large handful of torn days, you will no longer envy and praise, you said "If yesterday was a nightmare," riding the long wind, breaking through thousands of miles of waves, will I be proud that I once had a sweet dream?</p>
<p>Quietly, I have to breathe deeply, but I will never again and I am unwilling to weave a beautiful dream. It is enough happiness to be able to keep my life going. Please don't look at my face, it is thicker and I say so: "Living in this difficult century is really our good fortune, let's learn from real life!"</p>
<p>Although I clearly know that you will always say "complaining is the breath of the weak," I have put a sentence on the last page of the handbook of encouragement from classmates when I left school, I am willing to dedicate it to myself, in order to let life live and die by itself, without destroying it with my own hands, I write carefully: "Having a career is always happiness!"</p>
<p>Young little guy! Under the exploitation of the usury of love, we have exhausted all our youth to repay it. It is not anemia but it must be anemia, and it can't stand excessive and heavy loads. I want to review the freshness in spring, friend, let me gently say in your ear: "Please walk from real life".</p>
<p>What? In the crowing dawn, I still have to get up early to fill my belly.</p>

<h3>One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun and Little Tiger did not change their clothes this time when entering the pass, because they wanted to use that "pass." The passenger car they were riding in took advantage of the southward-bound Japanese army transport, which was four or five hours faster. As soon as they arrived at Tianjin Old Station, the passenger car was blocked and could not transfer to Beiping. So Qun discussed with Little Tiger, planning to delay in Tianjin for half a day, to inquire about traffic news on the one hand, and to take a look at what Tianjin had become on the other hand; anyway, there was plenty of time.</p>
<p>Qun originally wanted to find a hotel near Laolongtou Old Station, but then she suddenly thought of something and told Little Tiger, "Let's go to the 'French Concession'."</p>
<p>"Should we hire a car or walk, Aunt Ji?" Having just gone through endless troubles, walking out of the station, Little Tiger asked.</p>
<p>"You want to 'see' things, right?..." People from the Northeast often ask questions, Yaoqun could not be an exception: "And I also want to buy some small things; can't we just walk over there?"</p>
<p>"Okay, Aunt Ji..." Little Tiger agreed, while looking east and west, as if she were a country bumpkin who had come to the city for the first time, and everything on the street was worth a look.</p>
<p>It was a little after 9:00 AM. The southbound train had just arrived, and the northbound train was about to arrive. These two streets near Laolongtou were crowded with people, like ants, and did not become deserted due to the occupation. On the contrary, it seemed even more lively.</p>
<p>"Aunt Ji!" Little Tiger wanted to speak again.</p>
<p>"What?" Yaoqun was paying attention to the scene on French and Italian streets; she was paying attention to the people.</p>
<p>"Why don't we hire a car?" Little Tiger raised two small bundles of clothes.</p>
<p>"Are you tired?" Yaoqun looked at the small bundles in Little Tiger's hand; "Give me one," she said, reaching out to take it; indicating that she didn't want to make her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"No... it's just a little bit of stuff, only two or three catties, why would I be tired?" Little Tiger walked forward, her eyes still constantly looking around.</p>
<p>"Aunt Ji!" After walking two steps, Little Tiger called out to Yaoqun again.</p>
<p>"Hey... this child!" Yaoqun had something on her mind; on the one hand, she had to pay attention to things that she thought should be noticed. Usually, Little Tiger and Yaoqun always took the same action, taking Luo Yaohua's goal as the goal, but at this time, she suddenly became so mixed up, repeatedly interrupting Yaoqun's attention, Yaoqun couldn't help but feel a little strange. "What's wrong, Tiger?"</p>
<p>"Nothing..." Little Tiger showed a face that was both smiling and not smiling, wanting to speak but not speaking: "I'm saying, it's quite a long way from here to the 'French Concession'..."</p>
<p>"Quite a long way?" Yaoqun became even more strange; "It's just a short walk, one or two li to cross the bridge, and a few more steps after crossing the bridge..." Saying this, she glanced at where Little Tiger's gaze was sweeping, and then looked at Little Tiger's expression. She couldn't help but laugh: "You blind... this child!"</p>

<h3>The Glorious Day</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>—Written in Commemoration of Victory Day</p>
<p>Today two years ago – September 3, 1945, was a glorious and precious day. On the morning of this day, a solemn and good show was staged on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay: Japanese imperialism fell. Our (General Xu Yongchang, accompanied by Allied five-star Marshal MacArthur and other generals, spent eighteen minutes settling the crimes of Japanese militarists' decades of aggression. The Allied forces won, and we turned over!</p>
<p>This is such a solemn directing technique: The largest American battleship, the Missouri, was surrounded by aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers, quietly anchored in Tokyo Bay. The clock pointed to half past eight, and General Nimitz, who had white hair, arrived at the scene. He and MacArthur are both five-star marshals. Fifteen minutes later, MacArthur appeared, and military music was played loudly, and all officers saluted. Our delegation of six people, including General Xu Yongchang, and the delegation of the surrendering country also appeared before 8:40 AM. At that time, there were nearly four hundred news reporters watching the surrender, and they were busy using cameras and pens to record this scene from beginning to end for future generations to commemorate.</p>
<p>As the clock moved closer to nine o'clock, the eleven members of the Japanese delegation, with grim faces, led by Shigemitsu Aoi (representing the Emperor and the government) and Umezu Mijiro, were led onto the deck by American officers. The band on the ship also played for them, expressing welcome, because this is international etiquette. The arrangement on the deck included a long table covered with green cloth, two copies of the surrender document, an ink bottle, and a broadcasting machine. It was simple, tidy, and full of a solemn atmosphere. The Japanese representatives stood in three rows. The first row was Shigemitsu and Umezu, the second row was five people, and the third row was four people. They stood there with gloomy faces for six minutes, so that their true faces could be seen by the right people. Especially Shigemitsu Aoi, probably because he only had one leg, seemed to have a hard time standing, and sweat dripped down his face.</p>
<p>At exactly nine o'clock, the surrender ceremony began. After MacArthur read a very short broadcast speech in front of the broadcasting machine, he ordered the Japanese representatives to sign. The first one was Shigemitsu. Because he only had one leg, he was specially given a seat. Who knew that the fountain pen he took out was dry. The pen was big, and the mouth of the ink bottle was small, so it was impossible to absorb water, which was very embarrassing. An American officer lent him a pen to solve the problem. The second one was Umezu, who had two legs, so he didn't get to sit. After signing, he retreated to his original position and stood there like some grotesque monkeys.</p>
<p>Then, the recipients of the surrender signed. MacArthur signed his name with six pens, one of which was given to General Xu Yongchang as a souvenir. After MacArthur finished signing, General Xu, the representative of China, continued to sign. After that, the various Allied countries continued to sign. Including Japan, a total of ten countries took only eighteen minutes to sign, and this unprecedented good show was over. During the ceremony, MacArthur remained silent except for reading the broadcast speech. He did not pay attention to the Japanese representatives. After signing, he left the scene directly, very straightforwardly. Only the faces of the Japanese representatives were all unpleasant, and they had a special feeling in their hearts! When they frantically invaded China and attacked Pearl Harbor, and were full of ambition, they would never have dreamed that there would be such a day on the Missouri!</p>
<p>However, time is the most ruthless and merciless. Things have changed, and two years have passed since that glorious and precious day. Under the cover of the Japanese militarists' emperor system not being abolished, they are gradually "borrowing a corpse to return the soul"; when we look back on the past and face the reality, how can we not be worried!</p>
<h3>China's First Naval Victory Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>The Japanese pirate rebellion is recorded in history. They often harassed our coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang with their strong navy, plundering and leaving, and the Ming Dynasty suffered the most.</p>
<p>Historical records show that China's first naval victory against Japan was in the era of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty. The location was at the Xiaojiangkou in Korea, where more than 400 Japanese ships were burned.</p>
<p>Because at that time, there were three countries on the Korean Peninsula: Goryeo, Silla, and Baekje. Silla was close to China, while Baekje relied on Goryeo's support and often invaded Silla. Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, as the leader of the alliance, came forward to mediate, but was despised by Goryeo and Baekje. Therefore, the imperial court sent troops to conquer. At first, Su Dingfang conquered, but the people of Baekje received assistance from Japan and rebelled against the Tang Dynasty again. Therefore, Liu Rengui was sent to pacify Baekje first, and then conquer Silla, and the naval victory against Japan also took place at this time.</p>
<h3>A String of Locks</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>Lie Detector</p>
<p>Lie detector, the criminal is terrified, the lie is caught in prison, coercion, hard to escape punishment!</p>
<p>It is a pity that the world is full of cunning, accustomed to deceit, if the universal measurement of people's hearts, all lost, the secret of survival!</p>
<p>Note: There are only two lie detectors in the world, one in the United States and one in the Police Headquarters of our country, as reported in the newspaper a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Japanese Traders Come to Shanghai (Guangxu 21st Year, June 28th)</h3>
<p>Japan's foreign trade has reopened. In the present situation of China's stagnant industry, it is indeed a threat. Everyone still remembers the situation of Japanese dumping in the Chinese market before the war. In the Hongkou area, Japanese shops stood densely side by side. This was the scene ten years ago, and this phenomenon already existed fifty years ago.</p>
<p>"The Middle East peace has been achieved. The American consulate on Yangzi Road in the concession raised its flag a few days ago. There are quite a few merchant ships from the East that have arrived in Shanghai. On Peng Road, Tiantong Road, and Broadway Road, grocery stores have been opened as densely as forests, and they are even more lively than before."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Suffers a Flood (Guangxu 4th Year, July 18th)</h3>
<p>In the northeast, west, and three rivers of Guangdong, continuous rain has caused a disaster. The water level is so high that it has broken the record of the past twenty years. The Pearl River Delta has become a vast swamp, and hundreds of thousands of people are waiting to be fed. Government officials have raised funds separately to seek relief. The head office uses airplanes to distribute food. According to Guangxu 4th year, Guangdong Province also suffered a flood. This newspaper once recorded the incident:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, I read a Hong Kong newspaper that Zhaoqing Prefecture suffered a flood, submerging countless fields, lakes, and houses. The base group in Gaoyao County was also breached by the water. The crops were destroyed, and it was impossible to survive. If the weather is clear and sunny, it may be possible to save the remaining lives. Also, the water level in Xinhui County is almost the same as the embankment. The base enclosure in Xishan County has already been washed away." (Compiled by the News Data Room)</p>
<p>Drama Talk</p>
<h3>"Oil Vendor"</h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Through this love triangle story, the author indirectly reveals the ugliness of the rear areas before the victory. Here, we cannot help but admire the author's clever arrangement. It seems that the female protagonist, Fan Yan, could never fall in love with the businessman Yu Younan. However, in reality, such things are too common for people living in a low-pressure environment. Moreover, the author's theme is not so much about the sanctity of love, but rather the ugly phenomena before and after the victory. If it weren't for the collusion between officials and merchants, and the prevalence of corruption, Yu Younan would have failed before the victory. However, he didn't; he would speculate and develop in the new situation. The fact that the judge's plane took him to Shanghai is enough to explain everything about this character. During the war, Yu Younan made a fortune from the national crisis; after the victory, he made a fortune from the victory. All of this could not be achieved by a businessman's speculation alone. He must have someone behind him cooperating with him. This is a part of reality. Through this part, you can find the theme that the author is trying to express.</p>
<p>Of course, the script has its shortcomings. As a love triangle, some of the twists and turns seem inadequately explained, and the transitions are insufficient. However, these shortcomings cannot detract from the success of the script, especially the directing by Director Gang Shen, which enriched the entire performance. The overall handling of the play is technically smooth and comprehensive, which is a rare achievement. The only flaw is the ending of the fourth act, which feels loose and weak. This is a shortcoming in the industry.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Ye Zi's performance as Fan Yan and Fei Ke's performance as Li Zhongxiu were the most successful. The former's steadiness and sophistication and the latter's honesty and vividness enhanced the entire performance. The next best were Jiang Si's performance as Sun Kequ and Yan's performance as Wang Qi. It's a pity that Jiang Jun's language skills were relatively poor, slightly diminishing the performance. Xi Meng's appearance as Hu Ziyun was excellent. However, he lacked a bit of the businessman's habits, and his performance lacked ups and downs, being too straightforward. In addition, Diao Guang's performance as the male protagonist Yu Younan only showed one side of the character. He had the skills and charisma, but he completely lacked the charm needed to win over women. How could this "Oil Vendor" gain Fan's complete trust? This became a problem. The most unsuccessful performance in the entire play was naturally Su Yin's portrayal of the female protagonist Fan Yan. She failed to grasp the character's personality, her lines were poorly delivered, she lacked elegance, and her emotions were flat. Every time the scene shifted to her, it fell flat. Those love scenes were awkward and stiff. This was a loss for the entire performance.</p>
<p>The set design in the second act was excellent.</p>

<h3>Paying Extra</h3>
<p>— Chu Kuang</p>
<p>A new employee was recently transferred from Chongqing to a major bank in Shanghai. After this gentleman arrived, he had no place to live. Fortunately, he had some savings, so he spent five thousand legal tender to secure a house. Afterwards, he calculated and told a friend: "I get more than two million from the bank every month, and now I'm spending fifty million to secure a house. The monthly interest on this money alone is ten million, so I'm actually paying the bank eight million every month."</p>
<p>This is not a joke, not a myth, and not a novel. It is a fact.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Jewish Diamond Merchants in America (Continued)</p>
<p>Second, the best diamond rings can be bought in first-class diamond stores, but the prices are set very high. Even those costing four or five hundred US dollars are not considered good enough, and there are no discounts. The same quality goods would cost only one hundred US dollars in South Africa. After being shipped across the ocean, their value triples or quadruples. Moreover, under the strong lights, yellow diamonds are also seen as white. By the time you've bought it you can't return the ring, because back under the strong lights it remains white, still impeccable. If you insist on taking the diamond ring out into the sunlight to examine it, it would be considered too undignified and would lose the face of a big customer. Moreover, among piles of diamonds worth tens of thousands of US dollars, buying a diamond ring for four or five hundred dollars already feels embarrassing. Who would still want to nitpick?</p>
<p>Third, the most difficult to deal with are the second-rate diamond merchants in the side streets, these are notorious swindlers. Once you enter their shop, they will confuse you until you are forced to buy something. However, if you know the tricks of the trade, they will definitely respect you. In these kinds of stores, there are large diamonds, but no good diamonds at all. Fake stones are never mounted on rings. You want a one-carat diamond ring, and he demands six hundred US dollars, which is not considered expensive. You have to find the flaws in the diamond, such as spots, cracks, or chipped edges. These flaws can only be seen under a magnifying glass. If you find the flaws, point them out clearly, and impress them, then you can negotiate the price. They might sell you a diamond ring priced at six hundred dollars for sixty dollars. Take it back to China, fool the nouveau riche, and sell it for thirty million CNC, still claiming it's a bargain. Americans value brilliance in diamond rings, while Chinese people value size. Therefore, large diamond rings with black spots, cracks, or chipped edges are still considered fashionable in China. Even fake diamonds (Zikon) can be passed off as the real thing. Africans use cardboard boxes to store diamonds, Americans wrap them in thin paper, and Chinese people have police watching them. The different treatment of diamond rings is also like fate itself. (4)(7)</p>
