<p>〔本報徐州十七日電〕國軍十六日下千三時攻克蒙陰北之方山，殲滅共軍一個團。沂蒙山區戰局，一二日後可益趨明朗。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十七日電〕魯共軍殘餘主力約十八萬人，現全部竄集魯南蒙沂山區蒙陰·沂水·莒縣之中間地帶，國軍現已完成包圍新部署，展開殲滅大戰，十七日山區戰爭極爲凶猛。膠東無變化，共軍不斷由烟台，威海衛及靑島以南沿海以汽艇等運送械彈，足見共軍企圖久據山東</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十六日電〕魯境大戰正於沂水·莒縣·湯頭鎭·蒙陰四角地區激劇進行，共軍於此集結第二·三·四·六·七·八·九等七個縱隊之兵力，企岡遮斷臨蒙公路，襲擊國軍後側，國軍爲殲滅共軍主力，將原擬攻淄博與王耀武部會師之計劃暫從緩議，而以主力予該區共軍以反包圍，戰事重心因以南移，且自十四日進行以來，已歷三晝夜，晚共軍傷亡已達二萬餘，故一般估計，該區戰事如無意外變化，對魯境全局必可獲一決定性之發展。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十六日電〕濟南外圍平靜，東路國軍仍在棗園寺附近明水以西繼續掃蕩零星共軍。吐絲口方面亦在何莊以西地區加强工事，修復公路，外傳收復明水·靑石關，進抵博山附近，實言之過早。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十七日電〕吉林方面，來犯共軍受挫後，尙稱平靜，集結於較河及烏拉街外圍共軍，刻尙無任何行動。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十七日電〕吉林北江對岸烏拉街國軍已陷於孤立狀態，空軍在吉林地區出動協助，另一遠在南方之法庫，亦被共軍包圍，法庫距瀋陽七十公里，國軍往援，即可穩定。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十七日電〕懷德昨竟日激烈砲戰，共軍猛攻廿餘次，且有一部由西面突入，發生慘烈肉搏戰，但懷德城迄爲國軍苦守中，沿中長路西側北進之援懷德國軍，刻已進抵距城廿里之地區，即可望會師，自長春方面增援部隊，亦有進展。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十七日電〕中長路公主嶺北卅公里地區及懷德附近各據點均有激戰，瀋海路淸源附近亦緊。</p>

<p>〔中央社吉林十七日電〕進攻吉市外圍各據點之共軍先頭部隊，自經國軍反擊後，已退至二道嶺子以北，刻吉林附近已無共軍踪跡。</p>
<p>〔中天社吉林十六日電〕今晨六時，託者於微雨中，隨吉主席梁華盛，新八軍副軍長陳鳳仁等赴新吉林前方陣地視察，該處經國軍連日掃蕩廓淸，共軍已被迫退至北部山地，該市已漸恢復常態。</p>
<h3>國軍「以靜制動」　潘裕昆將軍檢討戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報長春十七日電〕孫立人至瀋後，將暫緩來長，新一軍定十九日舉行之陣亡將士追悼會，現亦已決定延期。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十六日電〕新一軍軍長潘裕昆將軍，十六日晚向長春市民發表廣播演說，檢討當前戰局，謂國軍係「以靜制動」，共軍如敢深入，則「一舉殲滅絕對有把握」。潘氏並稱：長春以不敢來但希望他來以便一網打盡。潘氏在播講中會扼要敘述各地戰况，據稱：（一）吉林方面共軍之第六縱隊及曹里懷部，曾一度竄至吉林對江之土城子，三泉子，經國軍一部出擎，包圍殲滅其兩千餘人，共軍現退出二十里以外，國軍正追殲中。（二）農安方面，初會三面被圍，但經一度激戰後，共軍即知難而退，除傷亡衆多外，並被國軍俘虜四十餘人，現該城廿五里以內，已無共軍踪跡。（三）德惠方面平靜無事，惟該縣西北之靠山屯一帶，民間食糧則被搶一空。（四）懷德方面，共軍之第一，第二縱隊（包括六個師），獨一旅及蒙古騎兵等，於十四日晨三時開始攻擊，一日之內，被殲三千人，當時曾有共軍一營，突入國軍袋形式地之內，全遭國軍殲滅。十五日共軍再度進犯，已被擊退，本日正午，曾發生激烈之砲戰，國軍傷亡甚少，該城糧彈充足，守軍士氣旺盛，再戰十天二十天，毫無關係。據潘將軍稱：此次共軍分散，竄擾力量薄弱，戰鬥意志亦不如前，據判斷，此次共軍竄擾目的，在搶劫糧食及壯丁，農安附近之糧食及壯丁，已被搶走甚多。潘氏並斷言，共軍「兵少力弱，實不能有大企圖」。最後，潘氏籲請市民各守崗位，安心工作，靜聽好消息。</p>

<h3>滬立委名額分配　係根據憲法規定　劉克儁談依人口計算只能得七名</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕上海各界人士對各省市立委名額分配中滬市僅佔七名一點，僉認殊欠公允。記者十七日往訪立院憲法法規委會委長劉克儁，控詢對此點意見；據談：立委名額多寡，係根據憲法第六十四條之規定，全國各省，各直轄市其人口在三百萬以上者選五人，其人口超出三百萬者，每滿一百萬人增選一名。滬市人口數係根據二十大年度計算（民十六年至三一十五年中人口數最高一年），共五〇二五六二一人，可選出立委七人，憲法規定如此，自不便擅爲更動。記者詢以瀋陽等地人口不及上海五分之一，而其所選出之立委僅少上海二名，豈非不公平乎？劉謂憲法既如此規定，吃虧便宜，當所難免。記者告以國民參政員金振玉曾指出上海納稅總額約佔全國稅收總額百分之四十，而所佔立委名額僅約佔全額六二二名，百分之點九，實欠公平。劉謂，國過去曾一度採用以納說多寡，決定被選名額辦法，然目前已不採用，其他國家亦無援用此制者。至滬名額問題，將來或可在職業代表選舉方面設法補救，如各職業團體中，上海會員名額較多，該市所選出之立委當可增加。</p>
<h3>朱敎長書面談話　盼學生體念時艱　政府對合理要求無不採納</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕敎育部長朱家驊，頃發表書面跌話如下：近來各地學生時起風潮，情形且日趨惡化，總括所提問題，不外（一）涉及敎育制度與行政，（二）學生本身生活，（三）學校之設備，茲分別加以蹬明如次：</p>
<p>（一）涉及敎育制度與行政者，如驚求遷校，請求改變學制等等，除其中多數本非事實，而爲誤聽謠傳，無中生有，不必究詰外，關於一切學校制度，本部向極愼重將事，如專科以上學校之分布，學院與專科學校之設立，均有縝密之計劃，提經各種敎育會議商討，並經敎育專家殫精竭慮，襲成決議，付諸實施。查我國大學集中京·滬·平·津之不合理，盡人皆知，此次復員，自應及時作一系統之檢討，而爲合理之調整，以我國幅員之質闊，倘不在內地辦學，仍聽其集中於少數大都市，此實置內地之敎育·科學·文化於不顧，并無異使人民不認識本國實情，而使敎育與我廣大農村社會隔膜脫節，本部於敎育復員之際，原想將多數院校留置內地，以事實上有困難，固已不得不斟酌情形遷回一大部份，但決不能聽任敎育長此畸形發農，而全不顧及均衡主旨，致失建國實際需求。至於專科學校要改學院，學院要改大學，此乃學制問題，須視其需要及設備，與乎師資充足與否而定，如不具備應有條件，一經要求，即予改辦，不特名不副實，反而貽誤青年，本部所以不願輕率從事，而研究逐步辦理者以此。</p>
<p>（二）學生本身生活問題，以言公費之增加，則公費制度原爲戰時救濟，由前方退至後方之求學靑年而設，當時明白規定，至戰事結束時爲止，政府爲重視靑年求學起見，將公費名額一再擴大，戰事結束後，猶念學生家長在復負期間經濟狀况，非但不對舊生取消公費，並且仍准新生由請公費，雖其名額有逐年遞减之規定，而對已有公費各生仍繼續給予，至畢業爲止，眞可謂愛護備至，而爲他國所未有。我國原爲貧窮國家，中經八年抗戰，經濟困難自不待言，維持公費，已盡最大努力，何况四萬五千萬同胞中無力入學者正多，大學公費生之受公費待遇，已屬特殊，公費原分兩部分，每人每月食米二斗三升，均按當地市價發給，不受物資影響，另副食費照公敎人員生活補助費七分之一計算，此次公敎人員待遇調整後，如京滬區公費生除食米二斗三升外，副食費已由每月二萬四千元增爲四萬八千元，其他各地亦均照規定增出，且公費係隨公敎人員待遇，每三個月調整一次原則而調整，政府自本諸實際情形辦理。復查我國目前子女入學已有「小學難於中學，中學難於大學」之情形，子女入大學負担最輕，而出錢者其子女或竟無讀書機會。此爲我國所獨有，誠屬不合理之事，言之痛心，希望大學公費生了解國家因此負擔之重，一般平民生活之苦，體念國家財政困難，更求專心致力於學業，庶不負國家之期望。</p>
<p>（三）學校設備問題。此問題確較嚴重，應該坦白承認，惟吾人須知抗戰以前，各級學校之設備，並不如何充裕，大多數學校亦不過因陋就　，勉可敎學。抗戰期中非但無法補充，且因搬遷及敵人搶掠，轟炸等關係，損失太多，而目前各級學校人數大率較戰前增多兩倍以上，如欲於短期間及極度困難之狀况下，大量補充設備，自非易事。本部年來百般設法結果，各校情形總可說較抗戰期中改進不少。本部及各級敎育行政負責同仁，自當努力設法，使敎育設備日見充實，職責所在，未或稍懈。總之，合理之請求，正當之建議，政府無不採納，本部無不竭力期其實現，然默察近日學潮，動輒罷課游行，要挾請願，囂張成習，幾於無可理喻，路人爲之側目，師長尤所寒心，影響社會秩序，逾越敎育範圍，少數陰謀煽動妨害多數課業，爲有計劃之搗亂行爲，其採取方式與藉口，如出一轍。此風不戢，敎育危險殊甚，切盼學生家長約束青年十弟，不任荒廢學業，並希熱心敎育社會人士共同指導。當今靑年之努力方向，不求學將何之？我大多數純潔學生，其速猛省。愼思明辯，澈發理知，探求眞理，識大體明大義，認淸時代，固守本身求學崗位，勿蹈入不可解救之境地！</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕政院負責人頃爲公費副食費問題發表談話，解釋政府此項措施之苦心，並謂：「政府在今日財政狀況下，實已盡最大之努力，欲再增加公費生副食費之款項及擴充公費生之名額，揆之現在國庫能力，委實無法負担。政府正力謀增加庫收，穩定物價，在未趨穩定，每三個月調整待遇一次，公費生之相當營着標準，仍儘力爲之維持，如少數學生不諒解政府之苦心愛護，妨碍公務秩序，政府有維特社會安全秩序之責，不得不一面責職各該學校當局負責開導制止，一面令治安機關切實執行職務，所望我純潔之靑年學生，抑制情感，體念時艱，以國家爲重，以學業爲重，母過於激越違反紀律，至爲親者所痛仇者所快，是所至幸！</p>

<h3>敎育太動盪了！</h3>
<p>— 周君尙</p>
<p>國家命脈所繫民族文化所依的敎育，今天全部在動盪，大學更動盪得使我們眼花繚亂！驅逐校長而罷課，要求加薪而停敎，爲了遷校而請願，爲了裁科而請願，爲了要求增加副食費而請願，反對總考，反對會考，反對不公平待遇，反對取消公費，反對改學制，反對績點制，一樁樁，一幕幕，層出不窮地往下排演連臺本戲，可是國家民族怎能吃得消這些惡果！</p>
<p>學潮雖刺眼，不一定是一種壞現象，而有時或且反映着正義感，責任心，求智熱，以至於生存欲。即使說學生受人利用，也得先有一個利用之隙，這個「隙」就是「問題」之所由起。我們爲什麼要讓人有「隙」可「乘」？這就該反省，該懺悔！青年學生有的是非觀念，甚少利害衝突，他們的過失眞的不過是「過失」而已，究竟有意犯過犯罪的不多。這裏不是說風潮鬧得應該，而要認識風潮的本質，針對着事實趕快解決。近，請看眼前的私立大學，遠，請看英美的大學。要知「魔鬼是找空閒人」的。</p>
<p>大學動盪不安的問題，原含有政治·經濟·社會·和敎育的四大原因，他們息息相關，有其連環性。</p>
<p>黨派退出學校，只是一句空話！我們看到大學生的所謂「反美遊行」，學生自治會競選等等，雖無鬧亂子，但暗伏的鬥爭渦流，如水銀瀉地，無孔不入。最痛心最危險的，是假借派系之名，而遂其營私之實，政爭的腐敗作風，已滲透到神聖的敎育裏。</p>
<p>經濟的影響更現實了。敎育旣採了飢餓政策，高中初三級敎育分配又不公允。第一敎授待遇不如國營機關小職員，這不僅是不公平的問題，不能生活比不公平更可悲。一家老少生命在朝不保夕的飢饉綫上掙扎，生死徬徨，敎書的人自己兒女失教；死下來棺材更無着落。這已超過了周濂溪和張橫渠的窮相了！社會上也在諷刺甚至輕視敎授，生活磨析得他們非乞援於罷敎的武器不可。其次因經濟支絀，校舍設備簡陋得不像樣子，最大最高的學府內，學生進岡書館，還要比乘車更擁擠，排着長蛇陣的鵠候，時光精力浪費得實在太可惜！至於學生的窮苦，他們天天爲衣食發愁，內地有些學生也幾已越過了「一瓢飲「簞食」的界綫。這稀苦是反生理反心理健康的苦！</p>
<p>居今之世，幾乎就是「百姓騷動，海內搖蕩，農夫釋耒，工女下機，天下之心，未有所定」的現象。社會紜紜擾擾，人心陷　，充滿着貪戾橫暴的風氣，道德似已無容身之地。君子與小人的遭遇，正如古人所謂「循法守正者見侮於世，奢溢　差者爲之顯榮」了！　樣的反淘汰，靑年學生耳濡目染，將要發生多麼可怕的反應？一個人感到苦悶時，動作是最好的藥石。於是靑年們除若干消沉者外，多犯了逐利走險。又因社會不景氣，畢業即是失業，他們更不得不用各種方法，作一個畢業後的準備，滿懷了這種心理背景，自然無可奈何地不得不拋棄了自己的正當目的，而無意中實行了人家的設計。</p>
<p>動盪的敎育原因，應該分兩面講：一面是敎育行政，一面是學校本身。爲民族子弟選一個大學校長，是多麼嚴肅的事，做一個國家的大學校長又是多麼隆重的事，豈可視同兒戲，又豈可以校長一年四季而常不到校？英士先烈，誕生在吳興，殉國在上海，而英士大學偏要堅執在金華，姑且不論，而好敎授不易請，設備空虛，文化食糧缺乏，羣龍無首，那才是學生的焦慮！有歷史有名譽有成續的交大，爲什麼又要改院裁科，拆得四分五裂？假使不鬧風潮，誰敢肯定這消息全是謊言？在兵荒馬亂之秋，各校復員到今天，才勉强透一口氣，幾年來功課斷斷贛續，守缺抱殘，那些學生眞是茫然漢然的一羣，焦躁疲勞的一羣，陰暗空虛的一羣，忽然要他總考，要他會考，如同晴天霹靂。總考會考，無非想提高程度，然而平時腐敗，臨時嚴厲，不但舍本逐末，且似不敎而誅。窮人脾氣大，自然容易起變。醫學與藥學不同，醫學在這國步維艱的今天，應該縮短年限，瑾學何必延長？這都不免庸人自擾的失策！在此種敎育行政下，只是製造不安的因素，一毫閃躱不掉。如此而欲平學潮，豈非同於抱薪救火？</p>
<p>學校本身惹起的動盪，實在與敎育行政亦有密切關係。例如聘派校長說不出標準，而若干營私舞弊者流，走進了神聖的學府，經濟不公開，勢必發生問題。一個「安南」和「越南」分不出的人，硬要他做專科校長，風潮自然又起來了。學校行政制度不良，容易形成校長獨裁或官僚化；一切事集中一身，一切權集中一人，學校好歹惟校長一人是賴，一旦校長發生問題，整個學校垮台。訓導集中於一個「畏」，院系和各個敎授的責任落得推得一乾二凈。師生接觸機會少，彼此感情淡薄，人格感化只成一句空話；導師制取銷後，每况愈下。課程必修的多而呆板，研究工作毫無，稍有一些成續的往往被腰斬。打了八年仗，連得人家已發明些什麼東西，迄今尙弄不淸楚。人才不集中，內地大學一切皆空虛，無設備，無醫藥，報紙不易到，敎授不願去。大學入學考試太深，入學後反而功課又淺，時光空下來，又沒有運動機會，學生只得另找出路，一有外鑠的亂因？就像水之就下，一發而不可收拾。</p>
<p>建設新中國，決不能建立在敎育動盪尤其是大學動　的基礎上。中國科學落後，人才缺少，大學敎育比任何國家都來得更重要。這種動盪局面，萬萬不可任它施長。救濟之道，莫大乎「公」與「誠」二字，而健全人事制度尤爲當務之急。規定大學校長標準，由國府羅致學界耆宿，組織選聘校長委員會，決定校長人選。大學校長必須是國家頭等人才，不但在學術上能够領導，道德品格也必須足爲國民的模範。敎授由校長院長和敎授代表組織選聘委員會，使敎授進校難，出校亦難。訓育放在各院系身上，人人負責。敎授待遇，須超過一般人之上，而在今日至少要能活得下去，然後做到荀子所倡的「……生乎由是，死乎由是。」</p>
<p>敎育本身健全了，然後可以督促政府儘速實行。蔣主席「敎育第一」的政策，照憲法規定提高預算，不但政府對敎育該全力以赴，就是整個社會，每個私人，也該隨時隨地，出錢出力，替國家民族的百年大計，盡其棉　。敎育本身則是政治要敎育離開政治，何異呌學生離開學校？不過爲了國家，各黨派該還給敎育自由。大學裏該講學自由，研究自由，更要批評自由，　學術文化在大家一致扶助的民主沃土中合當開花結果。</p>

<h3>貝文闡明現行外交政策　英關心在遠東利益　希望對日和約能早日訂立　尤注意恢復對華貿易關係</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教十六日電〕英下院本日開會討論外交政策，所論及者大半爲遠東問題，及英美蘇三國在遠東之關係。</p>
<p>工黨議員台維斯發言曰，英美兩國若聯合其力量，向蘇聯作戰，則世界必不可認爲蘇聯將並無友人，須知遠東各國將相率擁護蘇聯出面領導不願再與英帝國採取同一陣綫之殖民地人民及「黃種人」。余意美國原應要求各國合作，改組日本，但美國迄未出此，致使日本發生黑市與紊亂現象。</p>
<p>克雷頓即工黨議員威廉士，甫於最近率領調查委會，在緬甸考察完畢返國，亦發表演說稱，余認爲美國過去十年內干涉中國，對於該國人民之生活，已造成不幸之影響。中國人民尤其是民主份子，對於美國之干涉已感厭倦，此事將予吾人以絕大之機會。以言日本所竊取財產之歸還原主問題，余意美國所作所爲，相當有「私受贓物者」之嫌，此等財產係被日人搬往日本，原主迄未取得賠償，吾人深知此等財產已搬往美國，不論就國際公法或通常情理而言，美國均無權出此。保守黨議員弗萊徹曰，遠東問題亟待解決，美國在日本之能度，殊値得注意。工黨議員巴登發言稱，日本之新政治組織，若由左派力量掌握，則必能存在，日皇神聖之取消，是否有持久之効果，殊屬可疑。余意英國對於發展日本棉織物之出口，應有發言之權。</p>
<p>至此貝文外相起立答覆曰，若謂英國政府並不充分關切遠東，不免謬誤，反之，吾人業已在日本設立一聯絡委員會，艾德禮首相亦派有私人代表一人駐在日本。吾人在中國各地亦駐有使節，吾人刻正密切注意中國之情形。英政府業已要求中國政府會同美國，商討中英兩國之商務關係，中國之對案亦已送達吾國，英政府亟欲老察中國之勞工情形，故已任命勞工參贊常駐英駐華大使館。至於日本問題，英政府亦已任命勞工參贊。關於朝鮮問題，美蘇混合委會業定於五月二十日開始會商，其目的乃欲在朝鮮設立臨時政府與四强託管制度。以言蘇丹問題，吾人從未企圖向埃及採取綏靖政策，而使蘇丹人民蒙受損失，余會提議和平解決，但余從未企圖購買和平解決。要之，余仍希望現行觀點之不同，能在國際範圍內獲得解決，吾人最後必能解決此種意見之紛歧，但若不能獲得解決，則政府當局將不得不重新檢討其整個政策矣。吾人在締造和平時所當克服之最大障礙，厥爲吾人不應認爲英國已不復爲强國，或者以爲英國在世界上不復居於重要地位。其實英國對於世界和平，實爲重要國家之一，余希望早日締結對日和約，當屬可能，第一步步驟厥爲以此一條約爲基礎，成立盟國協定，政府當局將竭力達成此一目的，吾人將與各自治領政府保持密切接觸，澳洲與加拿大對於對日和約尤感關切云。</p>
<p>關於中國問題</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十六日電〕茲摘錄貝文外相有關中國閒題之言論於后：貝文稱，英政府曾在與美政府接洽締結商約之同時，亦向中國政府提出同樣談判，但中國政府已將談判展延至其與美國解決之後，中國方面之對案現已收到，且正由英政府各有關部門加緊研究中。貝文復稱，至於英國在華前公共租界之利益問題，已由中國政府依照一九四三年條約負責處理，且已設立一淸算委會，負責決定華方之債務，此事已有若干進展。但余承認進行確甚遲緩，余望此事將加速完成，余本人亦已密切注意此重大問題矣。貝文又稱，上海公共租界前僱員每人每月將自英國政府獲得四十鎊以下不等，吾人必須請中國政府在最後調整中，解決此事。（中央社按英國提出談判商約之要求時，我政府早已接獲美國約稿，並開始商談。至我方所擬中英商約稿亦早已於去年底向英方提出，惟迄今尙未接到英方對此稿之意見）。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾再度抨擊　英工黨政府</h3>
<p>斥爲自趨毀滅之途</p>
<p>〔路透社艾爾城十六日電〕邱吉爾在此接受自由市民銜時致辦，又事抨擊工黨政府，斥爲自趨毀滅之途。渠云，世界未有一處未嘗見英國事務這處理不當，英國勢力及聲譽，悲痛地趨於隨落。在巴勒斯坦保留英軍十萬名之衆，乃最無聊而愚蠢之舉，全世界國家之自行斷送者未有若英國</p>
<p>〔聯合社蘇格蘭艾爾城十六日電〕邱吉爾今夜在此間對六千人發表政治演說，尖刻質問工黨政府是否擬再向美申請借款，以解救英國政治與經濟困難。據稱：英國前次借款所存無幾，皆浪費於各種不必要計劃，實屬不智。大批兵力固應維持，但耗帑瞎　巴勒斯坦駐軍則殊不必。</p>

<h3>傳蒙巴頓將建議　英提早退出印度　印採嚴峻措施維持治安</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十七日電〕每日電聞報載稱：關於交還印度政權一事，倘會談結果不能與印度領袖獲致移交機構之協議，則印督蒙巴頓主主張較原定一九四八年六月之期提早實行交還。試就印督顧問伊斯美勛爵所發表之聲明，謂印度行政工作已瀕於瓦解而論，實已表明蒙巴頓促成印度領袖團結一致之努力，業已失敗，因此內閣遂電召蒙巴頓於下週初回國一行，作最後之協商。聞屆時將籌設移交機構，以免印度陷於內戰之局面中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十六日電〕此間某負責人士頃談稱；印度當局鑒於局勢日益緊張，且深懼印度在政治上之地位宣佈之後，將使宗敎衝突重起，故正採取嚴峻措施，以維持全國之秩序。一旦發生動亂，所有軍隊，均將立即動員。</p>
<h3>安理會討論希臘問題　美蘇代表起爭執　巴爾幹調查委會內部意見紛歧</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十六日電〕聯合國機構安全理事會本日循蘇聯之書面要求，開會討論希臘問題，席間各國代表爭論至爲激烈。南斯拉夫代表陳述意見時，美國代表詹森忽插言阻止，要求主席請南國代表限制其發言之範圍，使僅以所討論之問瞿爲限，不得對希臘作長篇之攻擊演說。蘇聯代表乃出而干涉，請主席要求美國代表勿阻止南國代表發言。比利時代表朗琪霍贊成巴爾幹事實調查委員會設立一輔助委員會，並謂事實調查委員會有權任命一輔助委員會，事前需要求安理會批准，此舉雖極簡單，但因其將在安理會創一先例，故甚爲重要，希望安理會謹愼審議此一問題。南斯拉夫代表對於事實調查委員會決定任命輔助委員會一層，表示抗議，並謂，事實調查委員會採取此種決定，實踰越其權力範圍，調查委員會之報吿書是否有効，亦屬疑問，因其包含希臘政府之控訴，而未計及間題之另一面故也。最後葛羅米柯要求安理會重新審議整個希臘問題，會議於此乃宣吿散會。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社日內瓦十六日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：聯合國巴爾幹事實調查委員會之工作，恐非即能結束，自前各代表間意見極爲紛歧，因此未能草擬聯合報吿書，或將由谷人個別擬一結論。</p>

<h3>美衆院委會即將討論　下年度海軍預算　較杜魯門原案削减百分之十一　　〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕衆院撥款委員會今日將下屆財政年度海軍預算修正案，提出衆院，以備下星期討論，總額爲三十一億三千五百四十八萬一千美元，較杜魯門總統原案削减百分之十一，即三億七千七百萬美元强，較本年度經費，削减十一億九千七百萬美元。預算削减後，海軍及海軍陸戰隊實力或將减少四萬人，雇員數百名將解職，若干海岸設備將停閉，但預算會對於海軍研究，與後備軍之經費，則實足撥給，絕不削减。　　海軍將領要求　撥給更多經費</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕美衆院撥款委會頃研究一九四八年度海軍經費法案，海軍部諸將領皆參加要求撥給更多之經費，各將領所陳述之意見如下：美海軍部高級情報官員稱，國際局勢較「吾人所預料者更黑暗」，渠並籲請加强情報工作。海軍少將股格里斯稱，海軍部已再度準備在另一緊急事件發生時，使戰時之海軍情報網立即恢復行動，國際局勢促使情報工作增加，並未使之减少，目前海軍情報工作乃與原子能之發展，噴霧飛機之普及，及火箭砲之使用相互適應者。同時海軍部復以向公衆所發表之報吿書，告小組委員會稱，據海軍部情報，蘇聯已自德國帶走一萬至二萬名科學家及技術師爲蘇聯工廠工作。海軍研究司司長李少將稱，蘇聯對軍事研究極感興趣，蘇聯一九四六年度預算表中科學研究經費佔九億四千三百萬元，一九四七年度佔十二億二千六百萬元，而蘇聯預算表及其政策乃含有秘密性質，各軍事研究項目可能以其他如敎育經費作爲掩飾。同時海軍部長爾萊斯泰稱，未來之「電紐」戰爭目前尙談不到，比基尼原子彈試騐已證明海上之艦隊非原子彈之獵物。福氏並稱，上年度海軍及陸戰隊之復員計劃，已使海軍官兵自四百萬人减爲目前之六十萬人。</p>
<h3>美國與南斯拉夫　將清算租借賑目</h3>

<p>〔美國新聞處華感頓十六日電〕國務院發言人本日稱：蘇聯代表團與美國租借問　團體現正在進行討論，但詳情尙無從獲悉。發言人續稱：對中國之租借討論將於「最近之將來」舉行，但日期尙朱定　。除蘇聯及中國外，對其他大國之租借結算問題，均已完成。</p>

<h3>美對外救濟方案　兩院聯席委會成立協議　保持三億五千萬元原額</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統請求於聯總救濟工作結束後撥款三億五千萬美元充對外救濟費一案，今日參衆兩院聯席委員會已成立協會，對總統原案加以同意。按此項救濟費將分撥六個國家及特港自由市。前在衆院討論時原已削减至二億美元，但參院力主如數撥給，乃有聯席委員會之召集。旋經參院議長范登堡極力呼籲全數撥給，該會乃作此項決定，但在正式付之行動前，該案尙須經過參衆兩院之批准，衆院在先，參院繼之。衆院外委會主席伊頓謂：渠或將於星期三將該案提出。兩院協議後之方案規定此項救濟費之應用範圍僅限於下列國家：奧，匈，希，波，義，中國與特港自由市。但得在全數中，保留一千五百萬美元，俾總統視情形必要時，予其他國家救濟之用。此外該案又指定在全數撥付之前，可向美復興銀公司商借七千五百萬美元救濟費。至衆院所提出以四千萬美元以上之款額撥給聯合國國際兒童基金會之修正案，參院表示讓步，乃亦成立協議。</p>
<h3>越局入新階段　可望政治解決</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕韓人孫田昌植戰犯嫌疑案，已於昨日下午由第一綏靖區軍事法庭宣吿無罪之判決。　孫田昌植係機械技術出身，戰前在滬創設精密工藝社，製造車牀銑牀等工業機器。三十三年敵軍佔領滬市後，由敵軍指定爲乙種軍工廠，令其製造軍用器械。勝利後曾由敵僞產業處理局沒收。去年八月間，有市民周幹輔等向淸査團密吿檢舉孫田昌植爲一資敵軍火商，曾向敵獻機並包修金陵兵工廠內機器，又利用日軍部奪得之謀得利琴行總廠爲敵收買硬幣，製造軍火。抗戰後期並在屋頂架設高射砲。淸査團接獲密吿後，即將本案移送高等法院審訊，以澳奸罪不成立，轉解軍事法庭，以戰犯嫌疑起訴。</p>
<p>昨日李良庭長宣讀「孫田昌植無罪」之判決主文後，即解釋理由，略稱：本案之起訴，係根據戰爭菲犯審判條例第二條第一款，即爲「支持對中華民國之侵略戰爭。」本庭認爲在審訊被吿是否搆成此種罪行時，須</p>
<p>孫田昌植（本報攝）</p>
<p>考慮兩點</p>
<p>：（一）何謂支持侵略戰爭？（二）是否故意支持？所謂支持侵略戰爭乃指其行爲能使侵略戰爭擴大或延長者，始得謂之支持。起訴書中所控各種罪行，除若千證據不充份，若干由被告提出反證姑置不論外，即作爲事實而論，對於侵略戰爭帮助或有之，若謂能使侵略戰爭擴大或延長，則尙不致有此影響。例如架設高射砲等對於侵略戰爭並無關係，至於利用謀得利琴行爲敵製造軍火及包修金陵兵工廠等，查當時被吿之工廠，由</p>
<p>日人管理</p>
<p>，且派兵監視，故即使確係製造軍火，被吿是否故意，尙成問題。他如收購原料，收購硬幣各點，證人方面未能提出確切證據，而被告之帳簿前爲第三方面軍搜去，如其中有此項記載，三方面軍當能供給本庭作爲證據，但三方面軍並無提供。關於獻機一項，被吿承認曾捐獻四十萬元，但提出證據，當時係受强迫以國防捐名義捐出，並非故意。且即使有此事實，對侵略戰爭亦無重要影響。再以刑法而言，戰爭勝利前被吿爲日本國籍，此種行爲自更不能搆成犯罪。綜上各點，故予無罪之判決云。</p>
<p>孫田昌植</p>
<p>聆判退庭時，喜不自禁，張口微笑。其親友及辯護律師江一平·楊凛知等均上前道賀。本案經判決後，尙待呈請國防部核准，孫田昌植仍交原保釋出。　按孫田昌植案原檢舉人胡成根徐天錫兩名，嗣亦被人檢舉漢奸，且早於一月十三日分別判處徒刑下獄，胡判四年，徐判三年。</p>

<h3>市財政不敷雖钜　決不增闢新稅　短絀數力爭補助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公務人員調整待遇後，市府本年度支出增加九十二億元，日前市政會議已決定電請中央補助，而各局因最近物價暴漲，紛紛請求追加預算，超出原預算甚鉅。財政局長田永謙昨與記者談：稅收今正値旺月，故尙可維持，若再隔一二月，轉入淡月，收支即無法平衡。本年度財政收支不敷甚鉅，開源辦法，除努力整頓稅收外，短絀之數，決向中央力爭補助。當此民窮財盡之時，目前決不致增闢新稅或調整稅率。田局長並稱：本市並無苛捐雜稅，財局開徵之一切稅捐，均依中央法令規定，而中央原允地方增闢之三種特別稅，本市現祗有市政建設捐及旅棧捐兩種，其第三種原尙可增闢，但當局現並無此意。</p>

<h3>伏波案傳訊證人　被告律師質詢疑點　旁聽席上噓聲四起　家屬退庭時大譁欲與律師拼命</h3>

<h3>證金改繳美金債券問題　轉呈財經兩部核定　昨市塲未有正常交易做開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於財經兩部批示所有證券交易所經紀人保證金代用品部份，及遞現交易本證據金代用品部份，均應改用美金債券繳納一事，經紀人公會方面擬具之意見，昨已函陳證交當局，經證交當局召開常務理事會議結果，已允將經紀人公會所擬意見，轉達證交監理官辦公處，轉呈財經兩部核辦，在未奉批示前，仍照舊辦法辦理。證券市塲各股行市，終於照日前收盤行市，於中午十二時許開出，延續至十二時半散塲，惟無成交。經紀人公會當於昨日下午二時卅分。召開全體會員臨時大會，討論迄五時許散會，會塲空氣，希望在明日照常開市。</p>
<p>經紀人意見　可歸納爲二點</p>
<p>查經紀人方面所擬具之意見，大要可歸納爲二點：（一）爲擁護政府推行經濟政策，願將身份保證金代用品部份之三千萬元，訂期認購美金債券。（二）遞現交易本證據金代用品部份，應請依照現行證交營菜細則之規定，仍准將有價證券（即目前上市之廿六種股票），與美金債券並行（按照票面金額）繳納抵充，該項意見當由經紀人公會函陳證交當局。</p>
<p>交易所當局　勸告照舊開市</p>
<p>證交當局於昨日上午九時許，即召開常務理事會，到杜　·王志莘·徐寄廣·莊叔豪·　季剛·鄭筱舟等，由杜理事長主席。經紀人公會理事長陳靜民，亦列席報吿經紀人方面之意見，旋即開始討論，迄十一時卅分散會。當決定將經紀人公會所擬意見，轉呈財經兩部核辦。在未奉批示前，仍照舊辦法辦理，除正式函覆經紀人公會外，並決定昨晨開市交易，時間暫時延長至一時半。會後杜王兩氏步入市塲，親向各經紀人代理人等宣達此項決定辦法，並囑暫照舊辦法開市，十二時許各股行市按日前收盤行市開出，迄十二時半散塲，無一筆成交額。</p>
<p>下午開大會　討議開市問題</p>
<p>昨日下午二時三十分，經紀人公會假證交市場休息室，召開全體會員臨時大會，到會員一百餘人，由該會理事長陳靜民主席，陳氏即席報吿接奉證交轉到部示後，公會方面咨商奔走，及向證交杜理事長王總經理請示經過。各出席經紀人旋對週一之開市問題，熟烈討論，歸納意見：（一）在財經兩部對經紀人公會所擬意見無肯定此示前，週一開市可能有兩種現象：（甲）仍將承　昨日十二時至十二時三十分間之有行無市姿態，（乙）恐發生暴漲暴跌現象。（二）在經財兩部未有肯定批示前，經紀人公會所擬之意見，無法保陣實現，應暫行停市。（三）證交行市之暴漲暴跌，影響已及於整個金融及社會之安寗，深望各經紀人所採取之舉措，應以社會福利爲前提，免失去社會之同情。（四）證交當局旣已允將經紀人公會所擬意見陳部，且在部示到達以前，仍照舊辦法辦理，則證交似亦已竭盡人事能力，理應照舊開市。各經紀人紛紛發表意見，會議至五時許始散。</p>
<p>接奉部令時　監理官遲一日</p>
<p>據證交當局某發言人語記者：此次證交於十五日接奉部示，惟經財兩部駐證交監理官，於十六日方接奉部示，故始於昨日下午通吿經紀人公會。渠稱：此次部示，變更保證金繳納辦法，並不如所傳述之嚴事。蓋事實上果有礙難照辦之處，政府證交當局，決無强制執行之理。且一切困難之解決，端賴雙方公開之治商，不難迎刃而解。渠認爲昨日證交開市情形，實係誤解所促成，相信週一當能恢復原狀云。</p>
<p>又據財政部派駐證交監理管王熬堂語記者：部示確於十六日方始奉到。惟以不明部中頒行該項辦法之用意及政策，故未便發表任何意見。惟證交當局所轉到經紀人公會方面所擬之意見，渠業於昨日午後以代電呈送財部，在通常情形下，一週內可望有覆示到達云。</p>
<p>募銷會聲明　此舉並非攤派</p>
<p>美金債券募銷委員會副秘書長范鶴言、昨爲財經兩部對證交經紀人應繳保證金，改以美金債券繳納事，特發表談話稱：經財兩部此項明令，發經過愼重考慮，其辦法甚爲妥善。在債券募銷之立場上言，此舉並非攤派。回憶廿餘年前信交風潮，即以公司股票作爲祖保品，致引起嚴結果。今如僞穩定證券市塲，以美金債券爲代用品，以替代原有股票，實更有其安全性。蓋美金債券可不受股票本身漲跌之影響，且可得更可靠之保障。矧目前股票之上漲，似已超過物價指數。惟如一時即將保證金如數換以債券，或將刺激股票市價。渠深信證交當局，定能酌最情形，綏和辦法之實行。渠意或不妨以分期分成辦法繳納云。</p>
<h3>統債回疲　外股停市</h3>
<p>公債昨初疲後回，統丙晨開一四〇〇〇元，散戶仍感乏勁，退至一三七〇〇元。五六〇室五〇三室等趁低來進，步回至一五六〇〇元，而後稍平。成交約五六百萬。結果較前收計甲乙各跌九百元，丙丁降落一千三，統戊亦挫一千元。外股昨亦受華股之影響，宣吿停市。</p>
<h3>國行貼放委員會　討論申貸案件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會工業貸款審核委員會，於昨日上午九時許，舉行會議，由朱通九主席。討論案件十七起，聞大部均可通過。對若干申貸案件，該會根據貼放通則規定，及申請貸款實際情形，分別核减。聞通過貸款之金額，大致爲甲貸金額之半數云。</p>
<h3>出口物資款辦法　四聯總處改訂公佈　並重訂日用品押匯辦法</h3>
<p>四聯總處前爲疏導貨源及鼓勵外銷起見，訂定放竟各行局承做押匯放款辦法，曁中央銀行辦理出口國外物資貸款轉質押曁轉押匯放款辦法二種，分別推行，現該兩項辦法實施已久，其中規定，與目前經濟情况已有未盡適合之處，特重行擬具國家行局辦理出口國外物資貸款辦法，曁國家行局恊助運銷民生日用必需品押匯辦法，茲分誌如次</p>
<p>（一）出口物資貸款辦法</p>
<p>（一）對象　以直接經營出口物資，加入當地本業同業公會之出口商，在內地收購出口物資，整理提還，運達口岸，或在口岸待運出口，需款週轉，得申請辦理押匯押透及押款。</p>
<p>（二）期限　貸放期限，以收購整理包裝提煉或運輸實際需要期間爲限，以押匯押透押款各項方式，酌定期限辦理之。惟前後總期限，最長不得超過九十天。如已接得國外信用證，未能即時出口者，得轉做短期打包放款，其期限最長不得超過三十天。</p>
<p>（三）額度　貸款額度，每筆在國幣五億元，或流通券五千萬以下者，各行局得先做後報。其超過此項額度者，應先專案陳准，方得承做。</p>
<p>（四）折扣　質押品折扣，以該業之出口物資按成本最高七折作押</p>
<p>（五）利率　爲鼓勵物資出口起見，此項貸款利率，以不超過月息三分六厘爲度。除匯水外，並不得另收其他費用。但各行局應審愼辦理，如有借資金不出口情事，應將自貸款之日起，所有利息加三倍計算，並即收回貸款，取消該戶以後申請貸款資格。</p>
<p>（六）匯水　押匯匯水，按當地各行局所訂匯率計算。</p>
<p>（七）轉質押　此項貸款，得向當地國行辦理轉質押曁轉押匯，按原貸款七折計算，其利率按原貸款利率二分之一計算。</p>
<p>（八）其他　承放行局應密切注意各類出口物資國外行市，如市價堅俏，儘量督促出口，多做押匯，緊縮押款，以資調節。</p>
<p>（九）實施　本辦法經四聯總處理事會核准後實施。</p>
<p>（二）日用品押匯辦法</p>
<p>（一）對象　運銷事業爲採購民生日用必需品運銷各地需用週轉資金，得向各地行局申請辦理進出口押匯。（民生日用必需品之範圍，照財部財庚一字第一八二八八號公函規定，爲糧食·棉花·棉紗·棉布·棉織品·皮革·食鹽·食糖·食油·紙張·肥皂·碱·火柴·藥·等類。）</p>
<p>（二）期限　押匯期眼，視運輸情形而定，凡滬收押匯，除秦皇島天津宜昌沙市不得超過廿五天，重慶營口不得超過三十天，（重慶在淺水時期得延長至四十五天）其他各地，不得超過二十天。</p>
<p>（三）額度　每筆押匯，在國幣五億元，或流通券五千萬元以下者，各行局得先做後報。其超過此項額度者，應先專案陳准，方得承做。</p>
<p>（四）折扣　押匯折扣，按押品成本最高七折作押。</p>
<p>（五）利率　暫以不得超過月息三分六厘爲原則，並除匯水外，不得另收其他費用。</p>
<p>（六）軒押匯　承放行局得將該項放款向當地國行按原貸款七折辦理轉押匯，其利率以二分之一計算。</p>
<h3>去化不旺成交殊少　米市定中帶疲　麵粉人心虛軟逐步下降</h3>
<p>昨日南北市到源共計七千四百石左右，市化仍懈，形勢定中帶疲，中下粳米仍在呆疲之中，而中下早稻亦少成交。秈米平平，白陰元亦然高定次削。</p>
<p>麵粉逐步下降，上江一帶兩週之間將見新麥，京滬綫於三週內，崑山一帶亦能出新，是以人心虛軟，繼續猛跌四五千元。麩皮廠方照開，實銷略動，價形暫平。豆餅早疲午定，無甚榮辱。</p>
<p>汕市狀况互見，動盪極少。生油因廣帮納取，挺升五六千至萬元。豆油廠方供源尙可，回跌萬元。淸油亦低五六千元，菜油亦然疲軟，大車蔴油貨多呆滯，小車則貨稀形堅。</p>
<p>菉豆依然少神乏交，黃豆高貨尙平，中下依然小削二三千元。芝蔴去化不振，軋短三五千元。生仁粵方動辦，猛漲萬元。紅糧站局，苞米育島有動，見挺一二千元。</p>
<p>米價穩定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米價格已趨穩定，據社會局糧食科長吉明齋稱，可有一時期平定。當農村春耕蠶忙及插秧時期，來貨較少。新穀普通需在雙十節左右登塲，故眞正之靑黃不接時期當爲七八數月。惟屆時畏江水漲，川米可販運而下，一面有洋米貼補，當可維持度過。</p>
<p>請發麥貸</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前物價評議會第二次會議，決議呈請中央迅即於半月內發放本年度小麥貸款。據悉：去年之小麥貸款係與糧貸同於四月間確定者，後因糧貸案發生，麥貸主持者對條文之研訂遂極審愼，拖延至八月聞方始發放。惟此時麥令已過，各麵粉廠商不需貸款，各地到貨之小麥，遂多落入有資力第三方面之手。此與目前小麥及麵粉價格之所以高昂，有莫大關係。而各廠商因原料缺乏，曾相率停工，陷於不能維持之境。本年文屆五月，有此敎訓在先，爲免重蹈覆轍，願及廠商之生存及未來糧價起見，故特睛中央儘速發放貸款。</p>
<h3>染廠抵補業外有進　棉紗市氣重見興奮　—棉布價格漲跌互見—</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况：初開因華股市塲停頓，人心虛軟，喊價亦無精彩。嗣以本街染織廠抵補原　，業外游資亦來吸收，市氣突轉堅挺。四二支藍鳳紗由一千二百十五萬做高至二百三十五萬元，較之上日續升四十五萬元。二十支特雙馬價爲七百十五萬元，亦漲三十萬元。其餘各支紗均比上日軋升自一二十萬至四十萬元不一。</p>
<p>棉布市况，昨亦因證券停市關係，初開市氣無神，旋以銀根鬆弛，染廠見低吸收，游資亦來，搜購不寂，行情轉趨翱翔。十二磅龍頭細布一度曾跌至廿七萬四五千元，至最後爲廿八萬六千元，比上日僅回小二千元。五福細有現貨甚充，軋降三千元。元布元斜及藍布等，亦較低自五千元至一二萬元。漂布細斜府綢等，步升四五千元至一萬五千元。</p>
<h3>人造絲恢復配售　昨市回跌一百萬元</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市因中信局對於絲織業已定於週一起恢復配售，且聯營公司料機絲亦已發放，故人心異常軟弱。昨市比上日慘跌達一百萬元，一二〇號高由有光，開盤即小，喊七百萬元尙無人過問，於是繼呈軟化，最小喊六百七十萬元，後盤旋至開盤價收盤。下午因乏人供應，乃喊大至七百二十萬元，東洋金三馬等俱吿下挫，七五號半光亦喊小一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市雖乏交易，但以將來新絲成本計算，尙須超越市價，故持貨者堅持扳價，喊價一致高升，尤以A字等級存貨極少，喊價較高，達二千二百萬元。C字等級討價喊二千一百萬元，高勻度另擔喊二千〇五十萬元，不過俱乏成交，干經昨喊價亦帶起五十萬元。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市稍呈呆定，華錦縐及無光紡等，因人造絲價下降，昨市價亦小五百元至一千元。被面價無更動，大誠格子璧縐做三萬〇八百元至一千元，比上日後市略小，週一期昨做一千二百元有成交。</p>
<h3>食糖上落互見</h3>
<p>昨糖市上落互見，趨勢平定。公會秘魯砂初爲三十八萬五千元，旋至九萬五千元，而四十萬〇五千元後略鬆，爲三十九萬五千元至八千元，終爲四十萬〇五千元，升萬餘元。二四粗白現貨四十二萬五千元，棧單四十萬〇五千元。二〇中砂白現貨三十八萬元，小萬元。棧單三十六萬五千元，四半軍白現貨四十萬元，三半軍白棧單三十八萬元。台赤棧單三十一萬五千元至三十一萬元。提青二十六萬元，順德靑二十五萬五千元至二十五萬元，均小五千元。興化赤二十七萬五千元，高貨二十八萬元。</p>
<h3>棉布染織業要求修正　布轉漢辦法</h3>
<p>本市棉布公會機器染織業八會，對於當局此次規定紗布轉口辦法，漢口特殊管制一點，頗表不滿。昨由潘士浩　紡管會吳國檳主委，申述三點：（一）紗布管制已遍全國，此次規定對漢口加以特殊管制，實爲不當。因漢口爲內地之中心地點，內地各　來滬不便，率多赴漠採購貨物，如對漠加以特殊管制，使客幫均感不便。（二）海關關單制度、請加以修正。（三）冷門貨如花布細呢，以小廠出品居多，應例外待遇。吳市長對第一點，尤提交下次紡管會討論；第二點關單，爲技術上問題，囑潘氏與紡管會業務處長劉文騰接洽；第三點冷門貨問題，吳氏允交劉文騰研究辦理。</p>
<h3>蘭竹枝略鬆</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝近來去化較淡，行胃不貪，現號方開出數十箱，魁蘭竹爲七十六萬元，普通五十二萬，均小一二萬元。</p>
<h3>福州長沙等地　匯率定期調整　　國家行局內匯小組會決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行兩局一庫內匯業務第三十八次小組會，於昨日下午，在中央銀行業務局舉行。當根據中國銀行分電各地分支行處查詢內匯情形結果，決定自本月十九日起調整以下谷地匯率。</p>
<p>計福州每千元收八〇元，（原九五元）。湖南區長沙，衡陽，及其他各地，均五〇元，（原七五元）。河南區均五〇元，（原七五元）。連雲港（新浦）一二元，（原一〇元）。湖北區漢口，武昌，均三〇元，（原六五元）。沙市及其他各地均五〇元，（原七五元）。杭州二元，（原三元）。重慶一〇元，（原一五元）。叙府，萬縣均五〇元，（原四〇元）。山西區一〇元，（原五元）。貴州，雲南均四〇元，（原三〇元）。</p>
<p>又悉：廣州汕頭等地，據調查結果，市面頭寸仍緊，故仍維持原狀，均爲九五元。昨日商業行莊內匯率，廣州自一〇〇元至一二〇元，西安二〇元，漢口三〇元至四五元。</p>
<h3>凡立丁銷路暢</h3>
<p>凡立頂邇來及時暢銷，本客各帮需胃咸有蟬聯，西裝之定製與中裝衣料之剪銷，均見活潑。因羽紗呢之軋缺，市銷較之往年爲尤盛，又因條子凡立頂之缺乏，造成米黃灰素色出路之加暢。美國貨到銷頗盛，近爲顏色太沉關係，成交續寡。藏靑色因祇銷上裝一路，實銷呆鈍，其售價，因之俱較灰色减低四五萬元一碼，昨普通本廠凡立頂，每碼均沽二十二三萬元，美國貨二十萬，英國貨三十萬元左右。</p>
<h3>茶市疲莫能興　泗安新炒青高</h3>
<p>我國茶葉向在國際市塲佔有相當地位，但目前海外出價教頻緊縮，而華茶生產成本，因受百物踊騰影響，與日俱增，外銷頗遭威脅，最近則更呈疲莫能興之慨。經營斯業者，因資金凍結，漸有不能支持之勢。</p>
<p>茲悉：該業中人刻甚盼當局協助，俾義挽救嚴重之危機。至於各　內銷花色，週來本街店莊及客帮，尙在染指中，過程以供求相埒，依然絕鮮起伏。惟其中如珠蘭，　烘及本年度溫州新旗槍，因產存兩涸，市氣較形堅俏。　又悉：本年度泗安新炒靑，天津各地突見注視，惜貨方索價奇昂，每擔高喊八十萬元，進購者以價高，態度轉取觀望，交易卒乏確實做開。</p>
<h3>鹽過保險費率　增加一元五角　承保公司拒絕接受</h3>
<p>本市保險業以川康鹽運水險失事頻繁，主要原因，多保戰重過額所致。因而各公司均不勝賠累，曾要求財政部調整費率。現經鹽政總局核定，照舊率（五元）增加一元五角。昨（十六）日已獲財部批准。惟此次調整費率數字過小，各公司仍無法承保。蓋保險費率之規定或調整，其權原屬於財部錢幣司，此番係由鹽政總局核定後呈財部批准者，故該業決予拒絕接受，並對鹽政當局提出嚴重抗議云。</p>

<h3>紐約　成功湖　一角　聯合國總部掠影</h3>
<p>— 合衆社特派員羅褒十日寄自紐約　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>紐約成功湖畔的聯合國總部，氣象煥發，眉目一新，有時候克像一所有色電影塲，舉凡開麥拉，回光燈，大腿女郎……應有盡有。可是聯合國的三千職員，却偏偏稱它爲「儀器廠」。原來這座平頂大厦，在戰時是斯貝利回　儀公司（Sperry　Cyroscope　Co.）的原址，現在已經面目全非，誰也不認識它了，只有在昆連的一所房子裏還在替美國海軍製造秘密器具。</p>
<p>這所「儀器廠」的廣大的空間已經隔成許多小巧的辦公室和長長的走應，板壁都髹作奶油色或靑灰色。</p>
<p>辦公室　富麗矞皇</p>
<p>安全理事會的辦公處最爲　骨，爲公衆所能望見，需要陽光和新鮮空氣的工作同志，偶然也張望着安理會的富麗矞皇的辦公室，藉以抖擻一下他們疲勞的精神。</p>
<p>安理會每星期開會二次或三次，無論誰都可以在開會前一兩天用電話索取免費旁聽證。從巴黎或重慶，倫敎或布洛克林請來的女嚮導員引導來賓入座，共有五百十四只座位，椅子上覆着番茄紅的軟墊，有幾只座位離開安理會十一位代表圍坐的橡木會議桌，只有數碼之隔。</p>
<p>代表們　姍姍來遲</p>
<p>這幾位代表常常遲到，在規定的開會時間十五分或二十分鐘以後，他們才聯袂姍姍而來，後面跟着　大羣助手。他們在馬蹄形的會　桌的外緣坐下來，面部表情顯得十分嚴肅。那會議桌的兩端，正面對着來賓。</p>
<p>各代表的席次每月有更動，目前英美代表坐在旁聽席左邊的一端，蘇聯的葛羅米珂坐在另外一端。他時常勃然發怒，搖頭擺腦，或用鉛筆指着會議桌的另一端即英美代表所坐之處。當他的對手作答時，他便正襟危坐，態度嚴肅。但無論他怎麼樣，始終引起着聽衆對他的注意。</p>
<p>卅九歲　葛羅米珂</p>
<p>葛羅米珂今年祇有三十九歲，他的外貌于人以黑的印象。他慣常穿着黑色衣服，他有一頭烏黑的頭髮，他的眼鏡邊也是黑色的。他的聲音渾厚而沉着，予人以陰鬱之感。葛氏當主席時，操着一口流利的英語，可是當他以蘇聯代表的資格發言時，他便操着俄語，而且對於他的發言的英譯常表示不滿。</p>
<p>繙譯官　驚人記憶</p>
<p>繙繹官坐在會讓桌孤形的裏邊。當代表用法語發言時，他們把它譯成英語，用英語發言時，則譯成法語。如果代表用別國語言發言時，便得譯成英法兩種語言。此輩舌人，大都是法國人。他們把大意摘錄下來，靠了他們驚人的記憶力，把冗長的演說詞一句一句譯出來。他們常常摹倣發言人的姿勢，往往把諷刺尖刻的言詞一一譯出來。有時候，他們也把脫口而出的惡劣字眼加以潤飾一下。例如某一代表，指責另一代嶔「說謊」時，可能譯成「不辛的乖訛」之類。</p>
<p>會議室白光閃耀</p>
<p>從會議室的天花板上的鋁質綱格裏發出不耀眼的間接的燈光，看上去好像電氣冰箱裏的冰盤。在那天花板裏還藏着特種回光燈，專供拍攝新聞片的攝影記者應用。開關一扳，整個會議室就浴在輝煌的白光裏，同時你可以聽得會議室四周發出開麥拉柏攝的聲音。此時，在座代表，都能泰然處之。如果正在演說時燈光突然開亮或熄滅，他們從不遺漏一字半句，知道那些攝影記者不會注意他的話語的。</p>
<p>新聞記者坐在聽衆席次的後面，因爲燈光欠佳，代表不能淸楚地看見他們，因此可以從容不迫地工作。在每次開會以前，他們忙着找各國代表談話，但半數的記者其實是無所事事，不過看看熱鬧而已。</p>
<p>美國人欲和葛羅米柯談話，這是個最好的機會。英國代表討厭局外人干擾他們的公餘生活，但葛羅米柯却表示歡迎，他對任何人都接談，你問他關於聯合國的事情時，他會吿訴你此刻他還不能够答復。接着，他會向你探聽最近發生的案件和美國人的生活片斷。</p>
<p>酒排間　應有盡有</p>
<p>代表們在休憇室裏從來不飲酒。那裏有一所酒排間，從蘋果酒到俄國白蘭地酒，應有盡有。但是侍者却閒得可怕。如果，葛羅米柯在開會前飲過鷄尾酒，這件事就得打電報到西方各國的報紙去，作爲一件新聞登載。他在公共塲所只飲過一杯牛乳。</p>

<h3>英國退出印度前夕　印回　分治　印度政局　在演時中</h3>
<p>— 德里二日航訊　本報特約記者　周祥光</p>
<p>印度內部的問題——印回兩敎在政治上的不能獲得圓滿解決，差不多有二三十年的光景，中間雖經甘地與眞納的會晤，希姆拉的圓桌會議，以及前英國內閣之印度事務部大臣勞倫斯，國防大臣阿力山大與商務大巨克立潑斯之來印訪問，終究不能挽回印回的僵局。迄至最近，英內閣已宣佈於一九四八年六月退出印度，還政於印人，同時，將任期未滿之印督魏菲爾將軍調去，而以蒙巴頓將軍繼任。局勢急轉直下，而印回兩方衝突，益見顯明。彼此所特觀點，愈趨不同，因爲以印度敎徒爲主所形成之國民大會黨，希望印度全面統一，這是站在地域觀點上而言，而回敎徒所組織的回敎聯盟，則期望印回分治，成立巴基斯坦與印度斯坦，蓋印回兩敎於種族，語言，文字，文化，及習俗，諸方面互異，恐難永久相處，此站在民　階層立塲而言。彼此立論，不無理由，而獲得兩敎人民之支持。</p>
<p>回敎聯盟　期望印回分治</p>
<p>回敎聯盟於一九四〇年在拉河決議中，宜佈所謂巴基斯坦所包括的區域，係指印度西北部的西北邊省，旁遮普，信德，及俾路文斯坦特區，與東部的孟加拉，阿薩密等省。若照此區分印度，則三角形的印度地岡上的兩大角，要被回盟佔去了。但另一角的中央部份，如海特拉巴及蒲浦兩個大土邦，又是回敎徒執政之區，與眞納不免有相當關係，來日與巴基斯坦有聯合的可能。故在軍事地理上言之，巴基斯坦實居有虎視印度斯坦之勢，同時東部孟加拉省的加爾各答與西部信德省的喀拉基，爲印度三大海港中之二個大港，於商業經濟上言之，回盟的巴　斯坦差不多掌　着印度與東西兩洋貿易的樞紐，因此巴基斯坦的區域內，旣具有軍事及經濟上之優勢，自必爲國民大會黨所誓死反對，但回盟的勢力，亦相當可觀。一則回敎徒人口約九千萬，幷且印度敎中階級森嚴，其所謂「不可接觸階級」的人民，佔了六千萬，向被「婆羅門階級」所鄙視，而回敎則倡人類如兄弟的平等思想，因此，印度敎中的「不可接觸階級」，不是改敎皈依回回，便是支持回盟。去年印度臨時政府改組，回盟特地保荐「不可接觸階級」聯盟的秘書長孟德爾先生爲司法部長，這便是證明彼輩支持回盟的一個最好例子。况且，英內閣亦不願在其退出之前，使印度發生流血的慘劇，故對印回分治，似有同意的模樣。</p>
<p>各省省督　將由印人擔任</p>
<p>根據回盟方面消息所傳，蒙巴頓總督即將發表文吿，表示原則上接受印回分治「印度斯坦」與「巴基斯坦」的計劃。回盟方面，並預料印督將設立一邊界委員會，以便劃分印徒敎多數區及回敎徒多數區，同時，可能修正印度政府組織法，由總督自任憲政領袖，其下由印回各組一內閣，向蒙巴頓負責。關於「印度斯坦」，「巴基斯坦」的行政，總督在印回兩內閣諮詢之下，將負責委任各省省督，將來印度各省省督，將全部由印人担任。於比，可知印回分治的趨勢，似已確定。所考慮者，英屬十一省中，究竟幾　個觀與回盟統治耳。</p>
<p>眞納主張　孟旁不得再分</p>
<p>國民大會黨亦不甘心　　　六省送與團盟，一如償納之頗，想到回盟大印度優個機上成立巴基斯　，朋　克族亦可在　　所擬　的巴基斯坦的旁遮普省內，設立錫克斯坦·同時，孟加拉省方面的印回兩方人口，又復相等，則印度敎徒豈能受回敎徒統治耶？因此，素以孟加拉省爲根據地的全印大乘會黨，倡導孟加拉省亦須分治，藉以削弱回盟勢力。這樣一來，眞納見勢不妙，遂於四月三十日，即國民大會黨執委會開會前夕，發表文吿，重申巴基斯坦係包括昔日回盟所宣佈的六省地區，孟加拉與旁遮普兩省，不得再分。人口方面，須彼此遷徙，國防上亦宜分開。否則，來日大局如何，殊難設想。此一聲明發表後，不到數十分鐘，國大黨的老前輩，現任制憲會議主席柏魯沙亦發表意見，反對眞納之主　，謂如欲回敎與非回敎實行分治，則必須澈底分治，即孟加拉　旁遮　兩省亦須分治，眞納不能兩者欲兼而不捨云云。因此，雙方衝突，益形尖銳，但問題必須解決，相　究非善事，於是，　大黨又請甘地老頭兒從比哈省，於炎炎　署之下，不遠千里而來德里了。</p>
<p>採集意見　彙呈倫敦解決</p>
<p>我們看目前局勢的開展，孟加拉，旁遮普，與信德三省，屬於巴基斯坦，似無問題。因該三省內　，皆係回盟所組，但西北邊省內閣，却是國大黨所主持，去年曾舉行大選，結果，不參加巴基斯坦。因此，近日回盟方面，要求重行選舉，徵求衆人意見，並推翻現在國大黨之內閣，情况正在演進中。總之，印回局面，愈弄愈複雜，蒙巴頓總督祗好將他們兩方意見，彙呈倫敦解決。但目前所可決定者，印回分治，已屬確定。將來「印度」之名，亦不存在。</p>

<h3>法國政黨明爭暗鬥的一面　戴高樂組黨之謎</h3>
<p>— 巴黎四月廿八日航訊　本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>這回來巴黎，正撞上法國政潮大動亂的日子，戴高樂將軍在布隆凡抗德紀念日，在斯屈拉斯堡「阿爾薩斯」州解放兩週年紀念日，連續發表了兩篇驚天動地的演講。演講的內容，國內早已有電訊刋載。大意是不滿意法國的政治現狀，不滿意現行的憲法，不滿意「分贓」式而不負責任的現內閣。他回顧過去第一次歐戰以後，法國政黨政治的墮落，警惕今天法國的政治局面，仍然在走雷諾達拉第時代的悲慘的道路，因此，他號召組織「法國人民大結合」，主張底改憲法，推翻現局，創造法國的新時代。</p>
<p>戴高樂　與賴瑪迪氏　的會見</p>
<p>像一池靜水被投了碎石一樣，法國的政治社會，跟着就激動起來。法國共產黨的機關報「人道報」，苜先就揭出：戴高樂是杜魯門「希土貸款」的「應聲蟲」，戴高樂一腦子法西斯蒂毒菌，他在做法國獨裁政治的惡夢。社會黨的內閣總理賴瑪第亞，在戴高樂第一次演講（三月三十日）發表以後，親自跑到「紐依」附近的那座白色小洋房中，去拜會戴高樂將軍，交換彼此的意見。事後，賴瑪第亞對新聞記者說：他推崇戴高樂將軍，因爲他是「拯救法蘭西的英雄」，但是以他這樣的地位，在紀一念「抗德」的日子，當著各國的使節，發表和政府目標完全相反的言論，似乎很有可考慮之處。一賴瑪第亞和戴高樂會見以後一星期，斯屈拉斯堡的第二次演講，又伴着雨後「春雷」響了出來，那一次，除了英國，加拿大大使以外，還特別有美國大使在座，聽衆在兩萬人以上。在那次演講中，而且正式提出了「組黨」的計劃。戴高樂自己不稱「黨」，因爲他一再提到「反對分贓式的政黨政治，反對無責任的聯合內閣」，因此，他命名爲「法蘭西人民大結合」。但旣然是一個政治性的人民的結合，有主張，有抱負，縱然不稱「黨」，實際上，在民主國家的運用當中，仍然是一個政黨。法國報紙上，稱戴高樂的新「黨」呌做RFP，（法蘭西人民大結合的縮寫。</p>
<p>現在的問題是在：戴高樂將軍爲什麼要組黨？組黨的對象是什麼？背景又是什麼？</p>
<p>揭出了　戰鬥法蘭西　新旗幟</p>
<p>讓我先從抗德戰爭時代講起。</p>
<p>一九四〇年六月，希特勒大舉犯法，三星期馬奇諾防綫陷落，雷諾政府屈降。那時候，戴高樂以一名陸軍上校的身份，代理陸軍部次長，在國防最高會議，決定忍痛投降的那夭，會議席上，愁雲暗淡，大家都拿不出主意。祇有戴高樂一個，站起來喊：「不能」。就在那天，戴高樂出奔到倫敦，扯出了鮮明的「戰鬥法蘭西的旗轍。</p>
<p>蘇德戰爭　發以後，法國的左派，特別是法國共產黨，轟轟烈烈參加了抗戰工作。那時候，戴高集領導的力量，集中在海外。當時，領導法國本土的地下運動的，是法國共產黨，以及一部份和共產黨同氣相求的所謂左派人士，他們有一個組織，呌做『民族抵抗委員會』，縮寫是CNL，CNL並且頒佈了『戰鬥網領』，後來經戴高樂承認，而且批准了的。</p>
<p>『戰鬥綱領』强調法國外患之來，是法國獨佔資本操縱法國政治的結果，『在納粹法西斯鐵蹄佔領法蘭西國土之時，獨占資本，托辣斯，又和德國合作，出賣國家的利益。』因此，CNL的口號，是『打倒納粹法西斯，企業國家化，淸算資本家』。那時候，共產黨領袖陶萊士，逗留在莫斯科，他的黨徒，操縱著CNL。</p>
<p>巴黎光復以後不久，戴高樂率領文武百僚，還都巴黎，CNL也從地下運動，公開到地面上來。前年夏天，我第一次來巴黎的時候，左右派還是一個大一統的局面，納粹打倒了，『法奸』一個個上法庭受審。特別是『法奸』新聞記者，不分老幼大小，都給戴高樂下令槍斃了。賣國言論的報館，一律沒收充公。大托辣斯如雷諾摩托廠，（雷諾Renault，法音讀作呃諾）其中和德軍合作生產飛機的一部份，被沒收，歸國家所有，雷諾自己且被捕下獄。（後來聽說死在獄中，但未確悉。）許多所謂左派所提的「戰鬥綱領』，一度雷厲風行。法國人講那時候許多大資本家，都躲到鄉間，閉門隱居，爲著恐懼財產被沒收，都紛紛搶著購置　鈔。至今巴黎市上，黑市美鈔　所以不能絕跡，有人說，是種因於那個時候的。</p>
<p>一年間　領導左右派　大一統</p>
<p>從V—E節到V—E節前後一年多之間，是戴高樂領導左右派大一統的時期，（或說聯合時期。）那時候的政績功過，現在成爲爭辦的焦點。在最近一次的記者招待會中，戴高樂自己，頗誇　當年的『復興氣象』。但是，掌　現內閣的法國社會黨和共產黨，却處處攻擊戴高樂執政時期的『壞政續』。我到巴黎第二天，讀紐約前鋒論壇報的巴黎版，它的社論題目，就呌做「壞紀錄』。社論的內容頗頌揚戴高樂是法蘭西民族英雄，但『可惜的是一九四四，四五年間執政的壞紀錄』，毀滅了戴高樂的前途。</p>
<p>一九四五年我在巴黎，那時候，政治的外表，是左右派相當統一的局面，執政的人，雖然都是戴高樂的『功臣』，但左派的戰鬥綱領，也在逐部實施。國營企業的口號呌得很響，但因爲資本家逃避，工廠什九停工，生產缺乏，甚至於糧食，日用品，衣料，都感覺恐慌。</p>
<p>那時候，戴高樂開始佈置他政治上的力量，他大大提高軍人的待遇，增加龐大的國防預算，有人說，那時候，巴黎市內，有二千幢最講究的住宅，都被軍事機關或軍人徵用。原來跟戴高樂辦『特工』的巴茜的『總部』，也在那時候公開出現，巴茜辦了一個『調查統計局』，一個通訊社，還兼辦了許多戴高樂的宣傳事項。</p>
<p>下台前　社共兩大黨　施攻擊</p>
<p>對政府公務員，那時候，戴高樂採取放任政策，機關疊床架屋，冗員多，效率少。到戴高樂下台前幾天，社會黨和共產黨的報紙，公開指斥戴高樂阻撓企業國家化，並且跟大軍火商人施南黛勾結，「出賣左派戰鬥網領」。</p>
<p>政局混亂從那時候開始，社會黨首先脫離戴高樂的領導。共產黨大呌大鬧，要戴高樂「滾蛋」，雖然那時節，戴氏否認共產黨首領陶萊士的公民櫂，（理由是戰時逃避兵役），但法國共產黨堅强地當握了「勞工總會」，法國五百萬產業工人，做了共產黨的有力支持者。原先和戴高樂將軍關係最密切的「民衆共和運動黨」，也因爲對制憲的看法不同，領導權落到了皮杜爾和一部份天主敎徒的手中。</p>
<p>他主張　修改新憲法　改前非</p>
<p>這裏，我應該叙述到戴高樂將軍對於法蘭西「第四共和」憲法的意見。我已經記不淸確切的日子，大概總是還都巴黎以後不久，那時候我在巴黎，聽過好幾次戴高樂的講演，他大聲疾呼，要法國人認識一九四〇年悲劇的敎訓。他說：「法國的苦難，淵源於第三共和的憲法太糟糕，憲法慫恿政黨政治，內閣三日一小變，五日一大變。各黨各派不是傾軋，便是分贓。……國防經費縮减，國防鬆懈……」所以他主張「第四共和」的新憲法，要痛改前非，產生一部相當集權的，有效能的，不足以造成政黨傾軋的新憲法。</p>
<p>事實上，第四共和的憲法，經過一年多的「難產」，最後人民表決的，還是和第三共和時代沒有多大差別。換言之，現在的法國憲法，是民主的，不是集權的。是政黨政治的，不是寡頭統治的。法蘭西的「憲政常軌」，還在走一九四〇年以前的舊路，不管這舊路是「覆轍」，還是康莊大道。</p>
<p>戴高樂在去年六月十六，和九月二十九日，有兩次攻擊新憲法的講演，其中最精彩的兩句是：「新憲法的所謂公民投票，九百萬選民贊成，八百萬選民否決，另外八百萬選民棄權，此種憲法，焉能頒佈實施？」但是，事實呢，新憲法終於實施了！</p>

<p>法蘭西　人民大結合　成立後</p>
<p>「法蘭西人民大結合」在最近四月十四日正式宣佈成立。成立以前的戴高樂兩次演講中，對新憲法抨擊甚烈。他還說：許多法國有才能的人，因爲不得滲入政黨的圈子，無法施展所長。法國政治現局，操於庸懦無能或別有用心的人之手，因之，越南問題，馬連加斯加問題，紛至沓來政府手足無揹。　兩屋期來，「人民大結合」吸收了多少羣衆？「人民大結合」今後用怎樣的方式爭取政權？現在都無法知道。大體脫來，憑戴高樂個人的聲望，和他「隻手挽狂瀾」的不朽的功業，對法國的血性靑年，對法國的軍人，確有極大的號召力。前天，共產黨的國會議員，提議制訂法律，禁止法國軍人，參加聽聆戴高樂的演講，說戴高樂有煽動內戰的危險，法國共產黨的『人道報』，並且刋載：戴高樂勾結法國陸軍的『內幕』。有一天，『人道報』上說：如今法國的陸軍參謀本部中，有兩間戴高樂的辦公室，『他憑什麼資格，公然在參謀本部行文辦法』？</p>
<p>人道報上，還替戴高樂擬定了未來內閣的名單，題目呌做：『假定戴高樂上台以後。』名單中的第一項是：『內政部長巴茜。（戴之特務領袖）。國防部長施南黛。』</p>
<p>施南黛是法國的軍火商人，猶之於德國的克虜伯。有人說：施戴兩家有親屬關係，或者是裙帶關係。法國老百姓而且相信：戴高樂所有的政治活動，都由於施南黛的經濟上的支持。所以戴高樂每次所提的政綱政策，都强調國防和增加軍事預算。這種論斷，是否過火？是否有點『小人之腹，君子之量」的毛病？我無法分辯。</p>
<p>不過，事實產生的後果，是軍人擁護戴高樂，軍火商人也必然歡喜戴高樂。這次戴高樂在斯屈拉斯堡演講以後，巴黎城內，到處寫着『戴高樂萬歲』的標語。另外有一種五彩印製的岡畫，一幅法國地圖，戴高樂武裝佩劍，站立在中間，上面寫着大字『斯屈拉斯堡』。這幅岡幾乎貼滿整個巴黎的通　小巷。『人道報』估計單就這　印刷費，要一百五十多萬法郎，因此，它的結論是：『戴高樂那有這筆錢？當然是施南黛供給的了』！</p>
<p>英報稱　法國要安定　非變革</p>
<p>華萊士到英國的時候，在倫敦放了一砲。他說：戴高樂組黨，是響應杜魯門的反蘇反共政策。（華萊士在巴黎的三天逗留中，閉口不談戴高樂）。前天，人這報上發表了一條消息，說：戴高樂組黨，是受了美國政府的津貼。這裏的美國記者，立即把電報發了回去，前鋒論壇報的巴黎版，還加了按語：『一種無知的悲意的宣傳』。</p>
<p>巴黎有幾十種形形色色的報紙都帶着濃烈的「黨性』，和英美顯然不一樣。戴高樂自己的『戰鬥報』，以及擁護戴高樂的天主敎徒的『斐迦洛報』，每天都替戴富傳辯護。以左右逢源起家的社會黨，還是萊翁勃倫一脈相承的傳統，態度比較持重，當今法國的天下，大半在社會黨手裏，國務總理賴瑪第亞，從來很少講到戴高樂。前幾天，巴黎傳說，賴瑪第亞二度夜訪『紐依白　』，社會黨的『人民報』，第二天便大大刋登賴瑪第亞『否認』的消息。</p>
<p>法國大總統奧里沃，社會黨的元老，現在到北非洲和西非洲出巡去了。總統到土倫軍港上船的那天，剛巧戴高樂的演講發表。有人問奧里沃關於此一問題的意見。總統祇回答了一句話：『今天法國需要的，是安定，不是變革。』</p>
<p>這句話正和倫敦泰晤士報的社評相合。泰晤士報沒有批評戴高樂將軍的是非，不過，他的客觀的意見，是『法國雖然復員建設太慢，但無論如何，正走在進步的途中，法國需要的是安定，不是變革。』雖然，這些話說得太『老成』，但作爲一個外國的新聞記者，能說的話，恐怕也就祇如此而已！</p>

<h3>現代法蘭西繪畫論　繪畫上的造形與眞實</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>所謂繪畫上的「造形」，結局是意在繪畫底純粹化；並係把握那純粹性（Purete）的過程。所謂進行繪畫底純粹化者，就是進行繪畫底被孤立化；且為有進行繪畫底還元的意義。所以不論觀看畫面上的任何綫條，並不是說明自然底對象的，一如前述，所謂繪畫底的純粹化，意在把握繪畫獨自的世界。這種純粹繪畫的世界，不是採取「自然對象」（Nature-Object），可說是採取「畫面對象」（Tablean-Object）。所謂自然現象者，不消說是把畫家所面接的自然物象依然不改原形的選作繪畫底題材之意。就如前述，可以意味到這是依照然的秩序不加變化而把握自然物之方法，並沒有把繪畫底孤立之世界或其立塲劃淸。所謂畫面對象者，未必是排斥畫家所面接的一切物象，無非是排斥那全依自然的秩序就那末處理的不純粹的態度。這一點，意在先從所調畫面的繪畫底世界出發，於是所處理的題材，悉已孤立化爲繪畫底資料之對象，悉已被裝入那繪畫底資料的範疇之中。是以即使我們在那題材中，見不到自然的原來形象，只要是繪畫底形象即屬無妨。這種形象，不必限定於抽象底形象。縱令具有具體底自然形象，亦不得不說是正被置入與自然秩序互異的孤立的範疇或繪畫底秩序之中。我們把這已被置入純粹的繪畫底秩序中的對象，特稱之爲畫面對象（Tablean-Object）</p>
<p>我們所以稱畫面對象——即形成一種純粹繪畫的「迭形」（Eornation）。這Formation，即係由於純粹的繪畫底綫，純粹繪畫薄色彩和構圖，使畫面統一於一種完成的藝術形態的。所謂統一畫面於一種完成的藝術形態者，這和作爲藝術而是完全的意思不同。所謂藝術底的是完全者，雖爲可從一種評價而獲得之結果，但這裏所謂統一繪畫於一種完成的藝術形態者，則是表現的完成，意在創作過程的一個終局。含有脫離作爲創作者的畫家的表現，而變成所謂作品的一種完成的藝術形態之意。這就是在繪書上的「造形」的意味，此後繪畫的價値判斷，已是和繪畫的「造形」成爲不同的世界。因此，所謂繪畫的技巧者，是純粹的意味，是繪畫底「迭形」。由於已被統一於一個繪畫的究成的藝術形態，而其使命充分有了終局。這不是說技法的消失，而是所謂繪畫底「造形」之過程昇華的（Steigerung）爲所謂繪這的藝術形態吧。</p>
<p>我們對於現代法蘭西畫壇正在嘗試這種繪畫的「造形」，正在探來純粹的繪畫底表現一點，毫無疑義。假如我從這樣的一般的考察出發，而突入更具體的問題，則所謂現代法關西畫的純粹性，全是屬於繪畫上的眞實（Realite）的探求。如果我們在十九世紀的繪畫看到繪書底天然狀態（Naturalite）的探求遺跡，則現在的法蘭西繪畫正邁進在這種眞實的世界。</p>
<p>所謂繪畫上的眞實者，不得不是和自然的直實不同的繪畫獨有的眞實（Verite）。繪畫上的一切眞實，是專向於藝術底世界的眞實，是已被置入所謂具有秩序的繪畫的世界之中的眞實。換句話說，繪畫上的眞實，可說是在所謂盡面的世界已被研究，被感觸，被樹立方向了的眞實。這種眞實，是根本脫離了自然，逼眞的那種眞實，而具有藝術底喜悅和藝術底美麗的。所以，我們特稱這種屬於藝術底世界的眞實性，僞寫實性。它含有藝術家所具有的藝術底感覺的意味，可說是屬於感受性方面的眞實性。所以，關於這種繪畫上的眞實，可能由於每個畫家對於繪畫所持的繪畫底態度之差異，現出不同的　相。</p>
<p>我們可以把所見於現代巴黎畫派之畫家底態度，大別之分爲下述幾種：</p>
<p>有一種對於繪盡的能度、是着重畫家的視覺底感受性的。他們是想把由於視覺所感受到的眞實性，將它「繪畫底」表現出來。所以，我們稱之爲視覺的寫實性（Realite　de　Vision）。雖然我們稱之爲視覺的寫實性，但如以其具有所謂視覺（Vision），而與十九世紀的印象主義的視覺等量齊觀，便屬不當。爲什麼呢？因其屬於印度派的視覺，是一種將自然逼眞自然的看的機械底視覺、旣非與自然遊離，亦無何等從自孤立可言。即無何等採取藝術底孤立態度，亦非納入所謂繪畫的被孤立化的世界的範疇中的視覺。只是就那末依照自然的存在態，觀看自然所給與的事象的視覺。然而我們這里所稱之視覺，是被納入藝術底範疇之中的視覺，是在藝術底存在態範圍內視物的視覺。所謂在藝術底存在態視物的視覺這句話，聽來也許有點奇妙，但這並不是用這眞自然的態視物的視覺，是指具有所謂藝術　及繪畫底視物的趨向的一種視覺。</p>
<p>其第二種繪畫底態度，是重視畫家的知覺底感覺性的，想把由知覺所感受的眞實繪畫底表現出來。故我稱之爲知覺的寫實性（Realite　de　Connaisance）。</p>
<p>所謂關于繪畫的Comaisance（知覺）者，意仍屬於一種感關於繪畫的知覺，是將那感受性的中心視爲理智底中心的塲合所感到的知覺；這在現代法蘭西畫壇很濃厚的顯現着。至少所謂探索理智底感受性一點，爲現代底特色之一。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　511</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這表示鶴見竭盡了他的柔道絕技。他何以要使出這們一個大身段？這個身段，又是一個什麼作用？他因知道對方必是練過一種特殊身法，能够始終藏在敵人身後，任你如何轉動，他總比你法這麼一步，所以始終是貼在你身後的。因此，他才決定這麼一個辦法；往前一躍，那是要讓對方一躍跟進，却猛不防一個倒拔葱、騰空回到原地；這樣，無論如何，對方總無法再應去身形了，况且對方貼在身後，是在平面範圍以內；設若能够凌空，就可超出平面，所以在半空　轉身子當口，常理該看出對方的動態了。</p>
<p>「好！」對方也暍釆了。</p>
<p>人是出現了；確如鶴見所料，對方恰是跟在他身後踴了過去，並且也眞的沒有料到他有這一着倒拔葱的精采演出。但事情也眞有一些特別；人是眞的出現在鶴見面前了，可是這現出的，那頭上拖着兩隻小辮子的人，却不只一個！好像是兩個以上，……三個，四個，……反正比一個多。</p>
<p>這們一說。如其不是鶴見那一個倒觔斗，把眼睛　的花了，好像酒醉以後情形，看不淸楚；必是這位小姐，妖怪投胎，使了分身化形魔法了。</p>
<p>殊不知這一套，在我國武術中，也是小事一段，正不必驚詫駭異。這是國術中的「八卦」門的身法，當日的孫祿堂大師，也曾在上海千目睽睽之下，當衆表演過。見過的人，必還記得。他所表演的，共分兩式：其一，在方尺大小地上，能使出各式騰挪變化身法，或進擎，或退避，只在尺餘見方地上。其二，在一方丈的空處　撒開八卦步形，能使觀衆，眼花撩亂，君出數個身形。然而孫祿堂大師的專長，還不是「八卦」門哩。</p>
<p>這話如今也無從說起了。當日，也不過十餘年前，北平先農壇，常有兩位「八卦」門的專家，日出前後、在那裏演習，看見過的人，大槪也不計其數。一位是張子長張四爺，六十多歲的老人。小小的個子，却是精神　鑠，身法　　，每天一練，就是一個多小時。</p>
<p>看他走着八卦　時，似乎並不迅捷，可是你要不揣冒味，同他比劃一兩手時，要不是　時人影不見，就是前後左右都是他的身形，在你週圍晃動；好像一人化成了數人一樣。他是「八卦」門的嫡傳，也就是這位　小姐姊妹倆的老師。</p>

<h3>無新聞的日子</h3>
<p>— 幾幹</p>
<p>西　有句話說，「太陽之下無新事物」。准此而論，世界上應該沒有新聞了。然而上帝創迭了萬物，這萬物之間，却要作出種種上帝計劃以外的活動。這就製造出千奇百怪的新聞來了。那條斑爛巨蟒引誘夏娃摘食生命之菓是新聞，夏娃轉勸亞當也是新聞，結果上帝一怒而將兩口子趕出了伊甸樂園，尤其是震動宇宙的頭條新聞。</p>
<p>然而任何新聞，過了相當時期，自會製成舊聞。當上帝創造出飛禽走歡以及萬物之靈的人類的時候，他當然希望他們融融洽洽，和好相處。此時忽然有一條狗啊鳴一口，咬了萬物之靈。件事不但百獸認爲奇怪，恐怕連造物的主人也覺得詫異。倘然那時有報紙，它一定可以成爲轟動一時的新聞。可是後來日子久了，狗咬人的事情日漸增多，於是大家才不將它當作新聞看待。於是才有爲人以爲祇有人哎狗纔算是新聞了。</p>
<p>可是後來人咬狗之類的事情，又像狗咬人一樣一而再再而三的發生，沒有人再覺得奇怪，因爲更奇怪的事情已經在不斷地發生了。從第一次狗咬人以來，這地球上各種新聞的新聞性就這樣爬過了千萬個階段，到了第二次大戰以後的現在，新聞性更是入了飛躍的狀態。我們現在　慣的東西，可以使古人看了個個目瞪口呆，即使太平洋忽然乾涸，希馬拉雅山峯　然飛往北極，也不能使他們更覺奇怪。</p>
<p>古人也許要說我們神經麻本，我們却要說他們少見多怪，可是當新聞性的發展，一旦加速前進，超過了我們神經的適應能力的時候，恐怕連最麻木的人們，也要震驚駭怪，憐惶然不可終日了吧。這時候我們就不免要想起西　另一句語「無新聞就是好新聞」，而祈禱一個無新聞的日子，因爲那才是至今尙未發生過的新聞呢。</p>
<h3>陳英士銅像</h3>
<p>— 呂洪</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>郁影</h3>
<p>— 關於原子彈</p>
<p>世界正走在聯合國和原子彈的交又點上，兩者是不相容的，假如人類選擇了原子彈，那就只好把「聯合國」放在一邊；假如選擇了聯合國呢，好的，原子彈的精神威脅必先解除。不然的話，幻想中的原子彈防綫，很可能招致第三次世界大戰。</p>
<p>被譽爲「原子時代之父」的愛因斯坦，曾經憤然地說過：</p>
<p>「我們必須喚起大衆的注意，使他們明白原子彈所迭成的實際形勢。只有以國際性的行動來阻止戰爭，可以把我們拯救出來，因爲那時就不必要備戰甚至不可能備戰了。」</p>
<p>這是說，一個能够洞見科學　緼的大科學家，他認爲要拯救人類，使之免遭戰禍，唯一的辦法是「國際的行動」。</p>
<p>是的，時至今日、我們還可以聽到關於原子彈的種種報導，有的說，長崎附近的植物已顯出遺傳上的變態，新生的樹葉一部分竟呈白色。由此可見，其對人類的精子的影響必大，又有人說，美國西雅岡的華盛頓大學最近失火，一部分救火人員搶救裝感比尼基海面捕來的魚的魚桶，事後仔　　騐那些救火員的身體，發覺他們已染有輕微的輻射綫。</p>
<p>最近，報上又登載說英國工人中有的竟患了「原子病」。事實是，英格蘭北部國營秘密原子研究站工人盛傳已喪失性交能力，據說可能是受了原子分裂的影警。此種性交無能的結果，已在工人家庭內產生一種嚴重的心理恐怖，也許眞正的原子病患者是沒有的，只是庸人自擾而已，由於自相恐嚇，英國或將增加幾個神經病患者，聞原子而胆戰心驚，談原子而汗涔涔下，倒是極可能的。</p>
<p>大事宣傳新武器的威力，這如果不是一　戰略。則也應該是由於一種好奇心吧。對於「原子彈餘威」呀，「原子病」呀等等報導，似乎都可作如是觀。如果愛因斯坦的話沒有說錯，則對於一切過分誇張原子彈威力，使得人們發生了一種「原子彈萬能」的錯覺，甚至由於這種錯覺可能引起了第三次大戰的報導，我們也應該負起責任來加以防備的，——讓人們在原子彈的大恐怖中解放出來，讓戰後的黎民去聽一曲貝多芬交響曲，這較之整日價「原子，原子」。實在有價値得多，也詩意得多了。</p>
<p>讓世界在原子彈的謠言中製迭出大批　經衰弱者來，這不會使喪生於原子彈下的日本人民竊笑嗎？——他們笑的是，他們只不過早走了一步而己。</p>
<p>據中央社紐約電，美國人每年化於賭博之費用約爲一百萬萬美元，爲製造原子彈費用之五倍。假如這消息並非誤傳，我希望過分宣傳原子彈威力的人可以醒醒了，即在美國，把原子彈跟輪盤賭的賭具放在天秤上，恐怕也還是後者較重一些呢。</p>
<h3>顏色和心理</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>有一次倫敦一個科學家請了六個友人在家中聚宴。入席之後，菜餚陸續上來，十分精美，客人都很高興，胃口大好。幾分鐘後。燈光改變了顏色。起初大家不以爲意，隔了幾分種，有兩個客人覺得心中作惡，　不住嘔吐了。其餘的人也食不下咽、離座而起。原來桌上的水芹（像中國餐桌上常有生葱粳一樣）　了鮮紅的粉紅色，牛緋變了灰白色，牛乳變了黑色，生菜變了可怕藍色，　豆變了黑色，花生果變了絳紅色，所有吃的東西都變了本來的而目。　　　人原來是做了主人的試騐品，燈光是用　光器將光譜中各色濾去，只餘得紅綠二種。科學家用了這個　騐來證明顏色對於人的心理上和生理上有相當的影響。可憐這些客人無緣無故的受了他的　弄了。</p>
<p>顏色對於植物的生命和生長亦很有影響。譬如有種植物的種籽，在目光中需經過十日才發芽，若是放在藍玻璃下，二日內即可發芽。</p>
<p>近倫敦有一座黑色的橋，在一個時期發生從橋上投水自殺的案子絡繹不絕有好多年，後來有人主張將橋改漆綠色，果然自殺案就减少了一半。據有些研究心理學的人說：「自殺案减少的原因，並不是因綠色有什麼可以使人樂而忘死的作用，而是因爲消除了黑色起人愁悶的作用。</p>
<p>病院的房間漆的顏色和病人的心理很有關係。在手術室內湖綠色，對於醫生看護，都有相當好的影響。</p>
<p>在審訊罪犯的法庭上，用綠色的光照着犯人，容易得到眞實的口供。</p>
<p>在飛機上有些人會頭暈和暈船一探，據說內部漆了藍色或綠色，就可以减少道種影響，最忌用的是黃色。</p>
<p>其他如商品的顏色也須迎合顧客的心理。</p>
<h3>高貴的施捨</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>義大利電影明星伊沙密因達，靠了她那一雙最美麗而又最善於賣弄風情的媚眼，在影壇上出了名，正不知有多少愛慕她的人，被這雙美妙的眼睛勾攝了魂魄去。</p>
<p>「巧笑倩兮，美目盼兮」，美人的美的確美在這一對眸子上。照說，這種美的眼風，只能在生前偷偷地送，悄悄地飛，雖然一送一飛，是含有莫大的魅力，足以顚倒衆生，但當生命一完，雙眼一閉時，它的力量也應該消逝了，然而不然，據本月九日合衆社的巴黎電，說妙已經和某大醫學家，簽訂了一張合同，在她死後，把她那一雙全世界長美麗的眼睛，獻給科學。她現在巴黎拍攝法國電話，她說在合同中中，規定她死以後，她那一雙美而媚的棕色眸子，就要給醫生移到別的盲人的眼窩裏去。</p>
<p>這雖然是一件身後的事，但在她本身上，可以設是她的絕大的高貴的施捨了。</p>
<p>西哲說：「一個人到世界上來，不是要拿點什麼去的，是應該施捨的東西給別人的」。如果沒有功業上和學術上的成就留給後來了，就慨然把自己身上所有的施捨掉吧，這是最高貴的施捨。比較「豹死留皮」，是更有意義的施捨，因爲豹之留皮，並不是自動的簽訂合同的啊。</p>
<p>這位伊沙密因達小姐留下預約，眞是會早作打算的。</p>
<p>佛家上捨身崖，捨掉自己的身軀，以救濟　　　獸，據說算是一種無上的　業。伊沙密因達小姐的施捨　眼給盲人，也可作如是觀。因爲這眞正是最後的所謂「臨去秋波那一轉」了。</p>
<p>但不知轉到別人身上時，也還能勾攝魂魄顚倒衆生否？</p>
<h3>「大秋葉」</h3>
<p>— 馮秋萍</p>
<p>絨綫編結新型花式之一</p>
<p>大秋葉花是最近發明的一種新型花樣，在以前各種編結書籍所尋不到的。他的締結方法，奧妙奇特，與衆不同。我們用兩種顏色，相配而結，更其明顯。別種絨綫服裝，起首是從下擺結起，而「大秋葉」的起首法，是從領圈上結起，而且長式服裝，短式服裝，可隨心所欲。領圈掛肩，前後身，都是一塊連成，結到胸前五寸長，收完秋葉之尖端，以下多用平針編結之。現在先將「大秋葉」花樣刋登本報，以供愛好編結的姊妹們作爲參考，大家多能締結一件，一九四七年一大秋葉」春裝。</p>
<h3>怎樣看管弦樂指揮？</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>指揮（Conductor）在管絃樂隊中佔有崇高的領導地位，他不但要把樂曲的內容正確地發揮無遺，而且要以豐富的理解力和純鍊的技巧去發掘樂曲的靈魂，藉以收到良好的演奏效果。</p>
<p>指揮技術最重要的幾個條件是：淸楚·靈活·有力·能控制每一位演奏員，使他成爲指揮者的機械，能辨別每一部份樂器的發音，以極好的聽覺隨時矯正錯誤。祗有拙劣的指揮，才過於賣弄技巧，亂舞着指揮棒（Baton），使聽衆看得眼花撩亂，漫雜無章。</p>
<p>現代舉世知名的兩大指揮家托斯卡尼尼（A.　Toscanini）和斯托考夫斯　（L.　Stokowski）的成功，就是合乎上述條件而又當於理解創迭力的指揮大師。但在音樂史上最驚人的指揮却是莫札特（　ozart），這位「音樂神童」大作曲家有一雙天賦奇特的耳朵，帮助他成功，所以當他指揮的時候，演奏員都特別仔細用心，緊張得不敢稍爲鬆懈，因爲每一件樂器祗要稍一發出極細微不正確的聲音，都逃不過他底耳朶。</p>
<p>管絃樂指揮比任何指揮都來得艱難不易勝任，龐大的樂器和演奏的人教使他不得不以全副精力去委身以事。而指揮管絃樂演奏，須要全身用力，而指示演奏員發揮表情時，又須用各種姿勢去暗示他們。所以有人常常把指揮看做一個巫師，他用各種神妙的術法，通渦指揮榨和手的運用，而把一串精彩動人的音樂引導出來。</p>
<p>這裏，筆者簡單地把一些極普通的看管絃樂指揮的常識，告訴愛好音樂的聽衆</p>
<p>（一）注意指揮的動作和姿勢是否淸楚有力，靈活美觀，而又恰到好處地跟音樂吻合。</p>
<p>（二）若要明瞭指揮能否理解和發揮樂曲的精神，祗要聽奏出來的音樂是否平淡無奇，毫無吸引力，或動聽感人，引人入勝</p>
<p>（三）注意指揮能否控制整個樂隊，由最前面的絃樂器到最後面的敲擊樂器都得留心。</p>
<p>（四）注意指揮有何暗示表情的　勢和特殊的方法。</p>
<p>（五）除了看指揮按術以外，聽衆本身亦需有指揮方法的常識，如四拍子的指揮方法是第一拍由上而下，第二拍由右而左，第三拍再由左而右，第四拍由右斜向上　到起揮點；三拍子的指揮方法成一個三角形等等。</p>
<p>（六）常常比較幾個不同的指揮者而　　同一樂曲的情形。以所得的印象和聽　，而判斷其指揮技能的優劣。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in the Mountainous Areas of Shandong; Communist Northeast Army Destroys Transportation; Liang Huasheng and Others Inspect New Jilin</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 17th] On the 16th, at 13:00 hours, the Nationalist army captured Fangshan, north of Mengyin, annihilating one Communist regiment. The situation in the Yimeng Mountains battle zone may become clearer in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 17th] The remaining main force of the Shandong Communist army, approximately 180,000 men, has now all fled and gathered in the central area of Mengyin, Yishui, and Ju County in the southern Shandong Yimeng Mountain area. The Nationalist army has now completed a new encirclement deployment and launched a large-scale annihilation battle. The mountain area war was extremely fierce on the 17th. There have been no changes in Jiaodong. The Communist army is continuously using speedboats and other means to transport munitions from Yantai, Weihaiwei, and the coastal areas south of Qingdao, which shows that the Communist army intends to occupy Shandong for a long time.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 16th] The great battle in Shandong province is raging in the four-corner area of Yishui, Ju County, Tangtou Town, and Mengyin. The Communist army has concentrated the forces of the Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Columns, attempting to cut off the Lin-Meng Highway and attack the rear of the Nationalist army. In order to annihilate the main force of the Communist army, the Nationalist army has temporarily postponed the original plan to attack Zibo and join forces with Wang Yaowu's troops and instead used its main force to counter-encircle the Communist army in that area. The focus of the war has thus shifted south. Since the 14th, the battle has lasted for three days and nights. The Communist army's casualties have reached over 20,000. Therefore, it is generally estimated that, barring unforeseen changes, the battle in that area will inevitably bring about a decisive development for the overall situation in Shandong.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 16th] The outskirts of Jinan are calm. The Nationalist army on the eastern route is still continuing to mop up sporadic Communist troops near Zaoyuan Temple, west of Mingshui. The Tusi Kou area is also strengthening fortifications and repairing roads west of He Village. It is too early to say that Mingshui and Qingshi Pass have been recovered and that the army has reached the vicinity of Boshan.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 17th] The Communist army invading Jilin has suffered setbacks, and the situation is still calm. The Communist army gathered on the outskirts of Jiaohe and Ula Street has not taken any action.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 17th] The Nationalist army on the Ula Street side of the northern Jilin Jiang River is in an isolated state. The air force is dispatched to assist in the Jilin area. Faku, which is far to the south, is also surrounded by the Communist army. Faku is 70 kilometers from Shenyang. Reinforcement by the Nationalist army can stabilize it.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 17th] HuaiDe experienced fierce artillery battles all day yesterday. The Communist army launched more than 20 fierce attacks, and one unit broke in from the west, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. However, the Nationalist army is still tenaciously defending HuaiDe city. The Nationalist army, moving north along the west side of the Changchun-Dalian Railway to relieve HuaiDe, has now reached an area 20 li from the city and is expected to join forces. Reinforcements from Changchun are also making progress.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 17th] There have been fierce battles in the area 30 kilometers north of Gongzhuling on the Changchun-Dalian Railway and in various strongholds near HuaiDe. The vicinity of Qingyuan on the Shenyang-Haikou Road is also tense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] The Communist army in northern Songhua, which suffered setbacks in attacking the city, has again begun to use the technique of destroying railway transportation in the Jilin-Changchun area. A small number of troops in northern Nongan detoured south and destroyed a bridge 46 kilometers north of Changchun on the northern section of the Changchun-Dalian Railway before dawn on the 17th, and also destroyed the Tianjia River Bridge north of Buhai (61 kilometers north of Changchun), cutting off the connection between Buhai and Dehui. A unit also invaded the Buhai station.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 17th] The advance troops of the Communist army attacking the strongholds on the outskirts of Jilin City have retreated to the north of Erdaolingzi after being counterattacked by the Nationalist army. There are currently no traces of the Communist army near Jilin.</p>
<p>[China News Agency, Jilin, 16th] At 6:00 AM this morning, I accompanied Liang Huasheng, Chairman of Jilin, Chen Fengren, Deputy Commander of the New Eighth Army, and others to inspect the front lines of New Jilin in light rain. After days of sweeping by the Nationalist army, the Communist army has been forced to retreat to the northern mountainous area, and the city is gradually returning to normal.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Army Adopts "Wait and See" Strategy; General Pan Yukun Reviews the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, This Newspaper, 17th] Sun Liren will postpone his arrival in Changchun after arriving in Shenyang. The memorial service for the fallen soldiers of the New First Army, originally scheduled for the 19th, has also been postponed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] General Pan Yukun, Commander of the New First Army, delivered a radio address to the citizens of Changchun on the evening of the 16th, reviewing the current battle situation, saying that the Nationalist army is adopting a "wait and see" strategy. If the Communist army dares to go deep, then "we are absolutely confident in annihilating them in one fell swoop." Pan also said: Changchun does not dare to come, but hopes that he will come so that they can wipe them out in one fell swoop. In his broadcast, Pan gave a brief account of the war situation in various places. According to him: (1) In the Jilin area, the Communist army's Sixth Column and Cao Lihai's troops once sneaked into Tuchengzi and Sanquanzi on the other side of the Jilin River. After a Nationalist army unit came out to intercept them, it surrounded and annihilated more than 2,000 of them. The Communist army has now retreated more than 20 li away, and the Nationalist army is pursuing and annihilating them. (2) In the Nongan area, they were initially surrounded on three sides, but after a fierce battle, the Communist army knew it was difficult and retreated. In addition to suffering heavy casualties, more than 40 people were captured by the Nationalist army. There are now no traces of the Communist army within 25 li of the city. (3) The Dehui area is calm and uneventful. However, the food of the people in the Kaoshantun area in the northwest of the county has been robbed. (4) In the HuaiDe area, the Communist army's First and Second Columns (including six divisions), the Independent Brigade, and the Mongolian Cavalry began to attack at 3:00 AM on the 14th. Within one day, 3,000 people were annihilated. At that time, a battalion of the Communist army broke into the pocket-shaped area of the Nationalist army and was completely annihilated by the Nationalist army. On the 15th, the Communist army attacked again and was repelled. At noon today, there was a fierce artillery battle. The Nationalist army suffered very few casualties. The city has sufficient food and ammunition, and the morale of the garrison is high. There is no problem in fighting for another ten or twenty days. According to General Pan, this time the Communist army is scattered, its harassment force is weak, and its fighting will is not as strong as before. According to his judgment, the purpose of this Communist army harassment is to loot food and conscript young men. A lot of food and young men near Nongan have been robbed. Pan also asserted that the Communist army has "few soldiers and weak strength and cannot have big ambitions." Finally, Pan urged the citizens to stick to their posts, work with peace of mind, and listen for good news.</p>
<h3>The Xu-Yan Section of the Jinpu Railway will be Officially Open to Traffic in Two Days</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 17th] The repair project of the Xu-Yan section of the Jinpu Railway is progressing rapidly. The two engineering teams, one going north from Teng County and the other going south from Yanzhou, joined the track at the 528-kilometer mark at Zou County Station on the afternoon of the 16th. A trial run is scheduled for the 18th, and the official opening to traffic will be on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Hu Zongnan Flies to Xi'an; Railway Transportation between Xianyang and Tongchuan is Normal; The Situation in Anyi and Yuncheng in Shanxi Province Becomes More Stable</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, This Newspaper, 17th] According to transportation circles, several hundred Communist troops harassed Yao County last night and retreated at dawn. Railway traffic between Xianyang and Tongchuan is normal. Also, Hu Zongnan flew here from Yan'an yesterday. Fan Hanjie accompanied him.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, This Newspaper, 17th] War situation in southern Shanxi: (1) On the 15th, more than 3,000 Communists fiercely attacked the north and south gates of Linfen, and once entered the south gate, but were driven back by the defending troops. (2) The Yuncheng garrison continued to win victories on the afternoon of the 16th. The Communist army besieging the city has successively moved east to Xia County.

<h3>Wang Yunwu Invites Political Committee Members to Discuss the Executive Yuan's Work Report to the Council; the Agenda of the Council Will Focus on the Economy</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] Wang Yunwu, Deputy Dean of the Executive Yuan, invited the political committee members Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Lei Zhen, and others to hold a small group meeting at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 17th to discuss the content of the Executive Yuan's work report in the Political Participation Council.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] It is reported that the central topic of this Political Participation Council meeting will be the economy, followed by politics. This reporter recently interviewed Yin Shuxian, a resident member of the Council, and asked for his thoughts on the current situation. Yin said: "I personally believe that the current problem is that the economy is more important than politics. If the economy is stabilized, social order will naturally be easier to put on track. In recent years, prices have soared, the cost of living is too high, and the value of the legal currency is declining. Therefore, I will propose to the conference to reform the currency system, stabilize finance, and stabilize people's livelihood; the so-called reform of the currency system is to adopt the gold standard and issue new currency." Yin described his method, if it can be adopted by the government and implemented in the short term, I believe that even during the war, it is still a very effective way to stabilize the economy. Yin's proposal is in its final revision and can be submitted soon.</p>

<h3>The Number of Legislators in Shanghai is Based on Constitutional Provisions; Liu Kejun Said that According to Population Calculation, Only Seven Can be Obtained</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 17th] People from all walks of life in Shanghai believe that it is unfair that Shanghai only occupies seven seats in the distribution of legislative seats in various provinces and municipalities. This reporter visited Liu Kejun, Chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, on the 17th to ask for his opinion on this point. According to the conversation: The number of legislators is based on the provisions of Article 64 of the Constitution. Each province and municipality directly under the Central Government with a population of 3 million or more will elect five people, and those with a population exceeding 3 million will elect one additional person for every 1 million people. The population of Shanghai is calculated based on the 20th calendar year (the highest population year in the 15 years from the 16th to the 31st year of the Republic of China), with a total of 5,025,621 people, and seven legislators can be elected. The Constitution stipulates this, so it is inconvenient to change it without authorization. The reporter asked whether it is unfair that the population of Shenyang and other places is less than one-fifth of that of Shanghai, but the number of legislators elected is only two less than that of Shanghai. Liu said that the Constitution stipulates this, and it is inevitable to suffer losses and cheapness. The reporter informed him that Jin Zhenyu, a member of the National Political Participation Council, pointed out that the total amount of taxes paid in Shanghai accounts for about 40% of the total national tax revenue, while the number of legislators it occupies accounts for only about 0.9% of the total of 622, which is really unfair. Liu said that the country once adopted a method of determining the number of elected people based on the amount of tax paid, but it is no longer used, and no other country uses this system. As for the Shanghai quota problem, in the future, it may be possible to remedy it in the election of professional representatives. For example, if the number of members of professional groups in Shanghai is larger, the number of legislators elected in the city can be increased.</p>
<h3>Education Minister Zhu's Written Speech; Hopes that Students will Understand the Difficult Times; The Government Adopts All Reasonable Requests</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Education Minister Zhu Jiajia recently issued the following written speech: Recently, student trends have started in various places, and the situation is deteriorating. The issues raised are nothing more than (1) those involving the education system and administration, (2) students' own lives, and (3) school facilities. These are explained separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Those involving the education system and administration, such as demanding the relocation of schools, requesting changes in the education system, etc., except for the fact that most of them are not true and are based on mishearing rumors and creating something out of nothing, there is no need to investigate. Regarding all school systems, this department has always been very cautious. For example, the distribution of schools above the junior college level and the establishment of colleges and junior colleges all have detailed plans, which are submitted to various education conferences for discussion, and educational experts have racked their brains to form resolutions and implement them. It is well known that the concentration of universities in Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin is unreasonable. This restoration should be a timely systematic review and a reasonable adjustment. If schools are not run in the mainland due to the breadth of our country's territory, and are still allowed to concentrate in a few large cities, this is to disregard the education, science, and culture of the interior, and is no different from making the people unaware of the real situation of the country, and making education isolated from our vast rural society. At the time of education restoration, this department originally wanted to keep most of the colleges and universities in the mainland. Due to factual difficulties, it had to consider the situation and move back a large part, but it must not allow education to develop abnormally for a long time, and completely disregard the principle of balance, resulting in the actual needs of national construction being lost. As for junior colleges wanting to be changed to colleges, and colleges wanting to be changed to universities, this is a matter of the education system and must be determined according to their needs and equipment, and whether the faculty is sufficient. If the necessary conditions are not met, once a request is made, it will be changed, which is not only a misnomer, but will also mislead young people. This is why this department is unwilling to act rashly and researches step-by-step handling.</p>
<p>(2) Student's own living problems. Regarding the increase in public funding, the public funding system was originally a wartime relief measure set up for young students who retreated from the front to the rear. At that time, it was clearly stipulated that it would end at the end of the war. In order to attach importance to young people's studies, the government has repeatedly expanded the number of public funding places. After the end of the war, it still remembered the economic situation of students' parents during the recovery period. Not only did it not cancel public funding for old students, but it also allowed new students to apply for public funding. Although its quota has a rule of gradual reduction year by year, all students who already have public funding continue to receive it until graduation. It can be said that they are extremely cared for and have not been seen in other countries. Our country was originally a poor country, and the economic difficulties after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War are self-evident. Maintaining public funding has exhausted the greatest effort. What's more, there are many among the 450 million compatriots who are unable to enroll. Publicly funded students in universities are already special in receiving publicly funded treatment. Public funding is originally divided into two parts. Each person receives 2.3 dou of rice per month, which is issued according to the local market price and is not affected by materials. The non-staple food cost is calculated at one-seventh of the living allowance for public education personnel. After the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel this time, such as the public funded students in the Beijing-Shanghai area, in addition to 2.3 dou of rice, the non-staple food cost has increased from 24,000 yuan per month to 48,000 yuan. Other places have also increased according to regulations, and public funding is adjusted according to the principle of adjusting the treatment of public education personnel every three months. The government handles things based on the actual situation. Furthermore, it has been found that there is already a situation in our country where it is "more difficult to enter middle school than elementary school, and more difficult to enter university than middle school." It is the lightest burden for children to enter university, and the children of those who pay for it may not even have the opportunity to study. This is unique to our country and is a heartbreaking thing. I hope that publicly funded university students will understand the heavy burden on the country and the suffering of ordinary people, understand the country's financial difficulties, and strive to concentrate on their studies, so that they will not disappoint the country's expectations.</p>
<p>(3) School equipment problems. This problem is indeed more serious and should be admitted frankly. However, we must know that before the Anti-Japanese War, the equipment of schools at all levels was not very abundant. Most schools were just humble and barely capable of teaching. Not only was it impossible to replenish them during the Anti-Japanese War, but too much was lost due to relocation, enemy looting, bombing, and other reasons. At present, the number of people in schools at all levels has generally increased more than twice as much as before the war. It is not easy to massively replenish equipment in a short period of time and under extremely difficult circumstances. As a result of this department's efforts in various ways over the years, the situation in various schools can generally be said to have improved a lot compared to the Anti-Japanese War. This department and colleagues responsible for education administration at all levels will strive to make educational equipment increasingly substantial. It is our duty and we will not slack off. In short, the government adopts all reasonable requests and proper suggestions, and this department will do its best to achieve them. However, observing the recent student unrest, they often strike and march, coerce and petition, and become accustomed to arrogance, which is almost incomprehensible. Passers-by look at it with disapproval, and teachers are even more heartbroken, affecting social order and exceeding the scope of education. A few conspiratorial instigations hinder the studies of the majority, and they are planned acts of sabotage. The methods and excuses they adopt are exactly the same. If this trend is not stopped, education will be in great danger. I sincerely hope that students' parents will restrain young children and not allow them to abandon their studies, and I hope that enthusiastic educational people and society will guide them together. What direction should today's youth strive for? What will they do if they do not study? The vast majority of our pure students, quickly wake up! Think carefully, discern clearly, and develop reason, explore the truth, understand the general situation, understand the great righteousness, recognize the times, firmly guard your own study position, and do not fall into an irredeemable situation!</p>
<h3>Temporary Meeting of the National Government Committee Discusses Methods for Handling Student Protests Across the Country</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Government Committee has scheduled a temporary meeting for 10:00 AM on the 18th to discuss pressing current issues. In addition to finalizing the selection of the Minister of Economic Affairs and other matters, the meeting will also discuss methods for handling the student strike movement. It is rumored that the government will not interfere with student movements that stay within established boundaries, but will handle any transgressive activities according to the law. Decisions are expected at the meeting on the 18th, and a stern statement will be released afterward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A person in charge of the Executive Yuan recently gave a speech regarding the issue of public-funded supplementary food expenses, explaining the government's painstaking efforts in this measure, stating: "Under today's financial circumstances, the government has truly made its utmost efforts. To further increase the funds for supplementary food expenses for publicly funded students and expand the number of publicly funded students, considering the current capacity of the national treasury, it is genuinely impossible to bear the burden. The government is actively seeking to increase revenue and stabilize prices. Until stability is achieved, salaries will be adjusted every three months. The reasonable living standards for publicly funded students will still be maintained to the best of our ability. If a minority of students fail to understand the government's painstaking care and protectiveness, and obstruct public order, the government has a responsibility to safeguard social security and order, and must, on the one hand, instruct the authorities of the respective schools to be responsible for guidance and prevention, and on the other hand, order the security organs to earnestly perform their duties. It is hoped that our pure and innocent young students will restrain their emotions, appreciate the difficulties of the times, prioritize the nation, prioritize their studies, and not be overly激越 (jiyue - excited/impassioned) and violate discipline, causing pain to their loved ones and joy to their enemies. This would be most fortunate!"</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Li Zongren is scheduled to convene a discussion meeting with the presidents of various colleges and universities at 4:00 PM on the 18th, hoping to eliminate the student protests.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] 138 representatives from Peking University's various departments and faculties held a meeting this afternoon at 3:00 PM, which adjourned at 7:00 PM. The meeting put forward numerous demands. In addition to announcing today an increase in student supplementary food expenses and the cancellation of the general examination, Peking University also issued a notice in vernacular Chinese, discouraging strikes. The last paragraph reads: "As for the students' freedom to express their opinions on current political issues, we naturally do not oppose it, but political issues are complex and cannot be resolved in the short term, nor can student strikes immediately achieve results. Therefore, we sincerely hope that students will seriously consider this and not sacrifice their studies to make political demands." This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Hu also convened a school affairs meeting at his private residence. According to Secretary-General Zheng Huachi, the meeting adopted a policy of persuasion regarding the strike. Official sources here report that students will march tomorrow, and preparations have been made.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Tsinghua University students went on strike today. The student union mobilized to Haidian, posting slogans, giving speeches, and performing propaganda plays. The private Fu Jen Catholic University remained calm. Students at China University and North China College opposed the strike, blaming the Chinese Communist Party for the war.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Zhejiang University began a strike today. Six student representatives departed for Nanjing by car this afternoon at 2:00 PM. In addition, over twenty student representatives from Zhejiang's eight normal schools petitioned the provincial government to improve the treatment of normal school students. Moreover, for the sake of demanding freedom of speech at the university and opposing the 種點制 (zhongdian zhi - possibly a system of monitoring student behavior), Zhejiang University suspended classes for one day yesterday. Zhejiang Provincial Medical College requested to be upgraded to a National Medical College.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 17th] The Provincial Government has recently promulgated measures for pacifying the people and urgently telegraphed instructions to all counties and cities to comply: (1) Labor and management must strive for coordination, work together harmoniously, stabilize order, and avoid labor unrest.

<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 17th] The Jiangsu Provincial Assembly recently telegraphed Chairman Chiang, saying: "After the great war, vitality is exhausted. All measures should prioritize maintaining social order. Any actions that directly or indirectly hinder the above requirements, such as strikes, class boycotts, and rice looting, must be swiftly and effectively prevented by the government. Therefore, the standing committee of this assembly has resolved to request the application of Article 10 of the new government's policy guidelines, which is to maintain social order and avoid emergency difficulties, to enact laws and implement them immediately.

<h3>At the Welcome Meeting of All Circles in Taiwan, Wei Daoming Urges Compatriots in Taiwan to Cooperate More with the Government; Mutual Suspicion Should Be Removed Urgently</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] Wei Daoming attended the welcome meeting of all circles in the province yesterday. During the meeting, Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, delivered a speech first, expressing his support for Wei's announced policy of "prioritizing stability in all measures." He also stated: "Many talented people from across the province have already been recruited as provincial government committee members and department heads. In the future, officials and the people will definitely be able to cooperate effectively." Wei then elaborated in his half-hour speech on the deep impression he had gained, namely that the national consciousness of the compatriots had not weakened even slightly due to being under Japanese rule. Moreover, the foreign public and teaching personnel currently in Taiwan do not have any sense of superiority. He emphasized: "All psychological mutual suspicions are wrong. We are all family and brothers and should understand each other urgently." He then urged compatriots in Taiwan to cooperate more with the government, citing as an example: "The current problem of rising grain prices caused by the large-scale smuggling of food out of the country has made the lives of the majority of people difficult, but the strength of the investigation personnel is limited. If the people of the entire province jointly prevent this, satisfactory results will be obtained." Wei finally publicly announced the five new measures decided upon this morning, effective from today, and added: "The lifting of martial law will allow the people to resume normal lives and enjoy the protection of peacetime laws. However, for the remaining small number of ringleaders of the February 28th Incident who are still in hiding, we hope that they will voluntarily surrender to the court and await its judgment. For those who blindly followed, we hope that they will return home immediately, and we will not pursue the matter. Furthermore, after the rural cleansing work concludes today, if there are still privately held firearms among the people, they should be voluntarily surrendered to the government. Otherwise, if discovered, they will definitely be prosecuted." Furthermore, Ge Jing'en, the former Secretary-General of the Chief Executive's Office, also gave a farewell broadcast yesterday, elaborating on Chen Yi's two major policies for governing Taiwan, namely economic construction and spiritual construction, stating that the living standards and knowledge levels of the compatriots in Taiwan must be improved, and hoping that the compatriots in Taiwan will continue to complete these two tasks under the leadership of Chairman Wei.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Manufacturers Consider the Overall Situation, Willing to Allocate and Sell Flour at Low Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] After the price of flour in Xi'an jumped from 79,000 yuan to 104,000 yuan after the last evaluation, public opinion unanimously criticized it.

The remaining 40% will be universally allocated to civilians at 75,000 yuan per bag. Manufacturers have been willing to accept this with a heavy heart in order to prioritize the overall situation. Fortunately, wheat prices have been trending downward in recent days. The wheat harvest will likely be available in about ten days, and the harvest is predicted to be excellent. The peak of grain prices, which once threatened public order, has been safely surpassed.</p>

<h3>Sino-Philippine Commercial Navigation Treaty to be Negotiated in Nanjing; We Urge the Philippines to Send Envoys to China as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 17th] It has recently been learned from well-informed sources that the negotiations on the commercial and navigation treaty between the two countries, stipulated in Article 8 of the recently signed Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship, will not be held in Manila, but will instead be held in Nanjing, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs directly negotiating with the Philippine Minister to China.

<h3>Central Bank Specifies Methods for Government Agencies to Withdraw Petty Cash</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Central Bank has stipulated the amount of petty cash that can be withdrawn from the treasury funds of various agencies in case of urgent needs, as it is often difficult to withdraw them immediately due to treasury procedures.

If they are allocated funds, 10% of the funds under 500 million yuan, 8% of the funds between 500 million and 1 billion yuan, and 5% of the funds over 1 billion yuan can be withdrawn as petty cash, but they must still be deposited into a security deposit account and then used. According to sources in financial circles, the Ministry of Finance has approved the regulations, considering both the factual needs of the various agencies and not losing control over treasury funds.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Education is Too Turbulent!</h3>
<p>— Zhou Junshang</p>
<p>Education, the lifeline of the nation and the foundation of national culture, is in complete turmoil today. Universities are even more turbulent, dazzling us! Expelling presidents and going on strike, demanding salary increases and stopping teaching, petitioning for relocation, petitioning for cutting departments, petitioning for increased food allowances, opposing comprehensive exams, opposing entrance exams, opposing unfair treatment, opposing the cancellation of public funding, opposing changes to the education system, opposing the GPA system – one thing after another, one scene after another, endlessly unfolding a continuous drama. But how can the nation and the people bear these evil consequences!</p>
<p>Student unrest, though jarring, is not necessarily a bad phenomenon and may sometimes reflect a sense of justice, responsibility, a thirst for knowledge, and even a desire for survival. Even if students are being manipulated, there must first be an opportunity for manipulation. This "opportunity" is the origin of the "problem." Why do we allow others to have an "opportunity" to "exploit?" This is something we should reflect on and repent! Young students have a sense of right and wrong and very few conflicts of interest. Their mistakes are really nothing more than "mistakes." Ultimately, there are not many who intentionally commit mistakes or crimes. This is not to say that the unrest is justified, but rather to recognize the nature of the unrest and quickly address the facts. Look at the private universities before you, and look at the universities in England and America further afield. Know that "the devil finds work for idle hands."</p>
<p>The problem of unrest in universities contains four major causes: political, economic, social, and educational. They are closely related and interconnected.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of political parties from schools is just empty talk! We see so-called "anti-American demonstrations" by university students, student union elections, etc. Although there is no disturbance, the underlying currents of struggle are like mercury seeping into the ground, infiltrating everywhere. The most painful and dangerous thing is using factionalism to pursue selfish interests. The corrupt practices of political struggle have infiltrated into sacred education.</p>
<p>The economic impact is even more real. Education has adopted a policy of starvation, and the allocation of education in senior and junior high school is unfair. First, the salaries of professors are lower than those of junior clerks in state-owned institutions. This is not only a matter of unfairness, but the inability to survive is more tragic than unfairness. The lives of entire families are struggling on the brink of starvation, in a state of life-and-death uncertainty. Teachers' own children are being deprived of education, and there is no money for coffins after death. This has exceeded the poverty of Zhou Lianxi and Zhang Hengqu! Society is also satirizing and even looking down on professors. Life has worn them down to the point where they have no choice but to resort to the weapon of strikes. Secondly, due to economic constraints, school facilities are shabby and unacceptable. In the largest and most prestigious universities, students are more crowded entering the library than riding a bus, waiting in long lines, wasting time and energy, which is truly regrettable! As for the poverty of the students, they worry about food and clothing every day. Some students in the interior have almost crossed the line of "one scoop of water" and "a bamboo basket of rice." This is a hardship that goes against physiological and psychological health!</p>
<p>In today's world, it is almost like "the people are restless, the country is shaking, farmers put down their plows, female workers leave their looms, and the hearts of the people are unsettled." Society is chaotic and turbulent, the hearts of the people are falling into depravity, filled with a greedy, violent, and tyrannical atmosphere. It seems that there is no place for morality. The experiences of gentlemen and petty men are just as the ancients said, "Those who follow the law and adhere to righteousness are insulted by the world, while those who are extravagant and deviant are glorified!" What a terrible reaction will be caused by such reverse elimination being seen and heard by young students? When a person feels depressed, action is the best remedy. Therefore, young people, except for a few who are depressed, mostly commit profit-seeking and risk-taking. Also, because of the economic downturn, graduation means unemployment. They have no choice but to use various methods to prepare for life after graduation. Filled with this psychological background, they naturally have no choice but to abandon their legitimate goals and unintentionally implement the designs of others.</p>
<p>The causes of turbulence in education should be discussed from two aspects: one is educational administration, and the other is the school itself. Selecting a university president for the sons and daughters of the nation is a very serious matter, and being a university president of a country is a very grand matter. How can it be treated as child's play? And how can a president not be on campus for much of the year? The martyr Yingshi was born in Wuxing and died for the country in Shanghai, but Yingshi University insists on staying in Jinhua. Setting that aside, it is difficult to hire good professors, facilities are empty, cultural food is lacking, and there is no leader. That is what students are anxious about! Why is Jiaotong University, which has history, reputation, and achievements, being reorganized by merging and cutting departments, tearing it into pieces? If there were no unrest, who would dare to say that this news is all lies? In times of war and chaos, various schools have only just barely breathed a sigh of relief after returning to their campuses. For several years, classes have been intermittent, holding onto the old and incomplete. Those students are truly a confused and at a loss, a group that is anxious and tired, a group that is dark and empty. Suddenly, they are asked to take comprehensive exams and entrance exams, like a bolt from the blue. The purpose of comprehensive exams and entrance exams is nothing more than to improve standards, but being corrupt in peacetime and strict in the moment is not only focusing on the superficial and neglecting the fundamental, but also like punishing without teaching. Poor people have bad tempers and are prone to revolt. Medicine and pharmacy are different. In today's difficult times, the length of medical education should be shortened. Why extend pharmaceutical studies? These are all blunders that cause unnecessary trouble! Under this kind of educational administration, only factors of unrest are created, and nothing can be avoided. How can we calm student unrest in this way, which is like carrying firewood to put out a fire?</p>
<p>The turbulence caused by the schools themselves is indeed closely related to educational administration. For example, there are no clear standards for hiring presidents, and some who engage in corruption and fraud enter the sacred halls of learning. Economic matters are not made public, which is bound to cause problems. Forcing someone who cannot distinguish between "Annan" and "Vietnam" to be the president of a specialized school will naturally lead to unrest again. Poor school administrative systems easily lead to presidential dictatorship or bureaucratization; everything is concentrated in one person, and all power is concentrated in one person. The school's success or failure depends solely on the president. Once the president has a problem, the entire school collapses. Moral education is concentrated on a single "fear," and the responsibilities of departments and individual professors are pushed away completely. There are few opportunities for contact between teachers and students, their feelings for each other are weak, and the transformation of character becomes just empty talk. Since the abolition of the mentor system, things have only gotten worse. There are many compulsory courses, which are rigid, and there is no research work. Any achievements are often cut short. After fighting for eight years, we still do not clearly understand what others have invented. Talents are not concentrated, and everything is empty in universities in the interior, with no equipment, no medicine, newspapers are difficult to obtain, and professors are unwilling to go. University entrance exams are too difficult, but the coursework after entering is too easy. Time is wasted, and there are no opportunities for exercise. Students have to find other outlets. Isn't there an external cause of disturbance? Like water flowing downwards, it is unstoppable once it starts.</p>
<p>Building a new China cannot be based on educational turbulence, especially university turbulence. China's science is backward, and there is a shortage of talent. University education is more important than in any other country. This turbulent situation must not be allowed to continue. The way to save the situation is nothing more than "fairness" and "sincerity," and strengthening the personnel system is particularly urgent. Standards for university presidents should be stipulated, and senior figures in the academic community should be enlisted by the National Government to form a committee for the selection and appointment of presidents to determine the candidates for president. University presidents must be the top talents in the country, not only able to lead academically, but also have moral character that can serve as a model for the people. Professors should be selected and appointed by a committee organized by the president, deans, and professor representatives, making it difficult for professors to enter the school and difficult to leave. Moral education should be placed on the departments and faculties, with everyone responsible. Professors' salaries must be above those of ordinary people, and at least be able to survive today, and then achieve what Xunzi advocated: "...live by this, die by this."</p>
<p>Education itself must be sound, and then we can urge the government to implement it as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang's "Education First" policy, as stipulated in the Constitution, should increase the budget. Not only should the government go all out for education, but the entire society, every private individual, should contribute money and effort at all times and in all places to do their part for the nation's century-long plan. Education itself is politics, and to ask education to leave politics is no different from asking students to leave school. However, for the sake of the country, all parties should return freedom to education. There should be freedom of learning, freedom of research, and freedom of criticism in universities, so that academic culture can blossom and bear fruit in the democratic fertile soil that everyone supports together.</p>

<h3>Bevin Clarifies Current Foreign Policy - Britain Concerned with Interests in the Far East - Hopes Treaty of Peace with Japan Can Be Concluded Soon - Pays Particular Attention to Restoring Trade Relations with China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] The British House of Commons met today to discuss foreign policy, with most of the discussion focusing on the Far East issue, and the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East.</p>
<p>Labor MP Davis stated that if the United States and Britain joined forces to wage war against the Soviet Union, the world would surely not believe that the Soviet Union would have no friends. It should be known that the countries of the Far East would rally to support the Soviet Union in leading the colonial people and "yellow people" who were unwilling to take the same line as the British Empire. I believe that the United States should have required all countries to cooperate in reorganizing Japan, but the United States has not done so, causing black markets and disorder in Japan.</p>
<p>Clayton, also a Labor MP Williams, who recently led an investigation committee that completed its inspection in Burma and returned home, also delivered a speech, stating that he believed that the United States' intervention in China over the past decade had caused an unfortunate impact on the lives of the people of that country. The Chinese people, especially democrats, are tired of American intervention, and this will give us a great opportunity. Regarding the issue of the return of property stolen by Japan to its original owners, I believe that the actions of the United States are rather like "receiving stolen goods privately." These properties were moved to Japan by the Japanese, and the original owners have not yet received compensation. We know that these properties have been moved to the United States. Whether from the perspective of international law or common sense, the United States has no right to do this. Conservative MP Fletcher stated that the Far East issue needs to be resolved urgently, and the United States' ability in Japan is worthy of attention. Labor MP Barden stated that if the new political organization in Japan is controlled by left-wing forces, it will surely be able to exist. It is doubtful whether the abolition of the divinity of the Japanese Emperor will have a lasting effect. I believe that Britain should have a say in the development of Japan's cotton textile exports.</p>
<p>At this point, Foreign Secretary Bevin stood up and replied that it was a misunderstanding to say that the British government was not fully concerned about the Far East. On the contrary, we have already established a liaison committee in Japan, and Prime Minister Attlee has also appointed a personal representative to be stationed in Japan. We also have envoys stationed throughout China, and we are paying close attention to the situation in China. The British government has already requested the Chinese government to consult with the United States to discuss the trade relations between China and Britain, and China's counter-proposal has also been sent to our country. The British government urgently wants to examine the labor situation in China, so it has appointed a labor counselor to be stationed permanently at the British Embassy in China. As for the Japan issue, the British government has also appointed a labor counselor. Regarding the Korean issue, the US-Soviet Joint Commission is scheduled to begin consultations on May 20, with the aim of establishing a provisional government and a four-power trusteeship system in Korea. Regarding the Sudan issue, we have never attempted to adopt a policy of appeasement towards Egypt at the expense of the Sudanese people. I have proposed a peaceful solution, but I have never attempted to buy a peaceful solution. In short, I still hope that the current differences in views can be resolved internationally. We will eventually be able to resolve these differences of opinion, but if we cannot achieve a resolution, the government authorities will have to re-examine its entire policy. The greatest obstacle we must overcome in making peace is that we should not think that Britain is no longer a strong country, or that Britain no longer occupies an important position in the world. In fact, Britain is one of the important countries for world peace. I hope that a treaty of peace with Japan can be concluded soon, which is possible. The first step is to form an Allied agreement based on this treaty. The government authorities will do their best to achieve this goal. We will maintain close contact with the governments of the various autonomous territories, as Australia and Canada are particularly concerned about the treaty of peace with Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding the China issue</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th] The following is an excerpt from Foreign Secretary Bevin's remarks regarding the China issue: Bevin stated that the British government had also made the same negotiation proposal to the Chinese government at the same time as it was in contact with the US government regarding the conclusion of a commercial treaty, but the Chinese government has extended the negotiations until after it resolves the issue with the United States. China's counter-proposal has now been received and is being intensively studied by the relevant departments of the British government. Bevin further stated that as for the issue of Britain's former public concession interests in China, the Chinese government is responsible for handling it in accordance with the 1943 treaty, and a liquidation committee has been established to determine the debts of the Chinese side. There has been some progress in this matter. But I admit that progress has been very slow, and I hope that this matter will be completed more quickly. I myself am paying close attention to this important issue. Bevin also stated that former employees of the Shanghai Public Concession will receive no less than 40 pounds per month from the British government. We must ask the Chinese government to resolve this matter in the final adjustment. (Central News Agency note: When the British government proposed the request to negotiate a commercial treaty, our government had already received the US draft and began negotiations. As for the draft of the Sino-British commercial treaty prepared by our side, it was submitted to the British side at the end of last year, but no opinion has been received from the British side on this draft to date.)</p>
<h3>Churchill Again Criticizes - British Labor Government</h3>
<p>Condemns it as Heading Down a Path of Self-Destruction</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ayr, 16th] Churchill, while receiving the freedom of the city here, again criticized the Labor government, condemning it as heading down a path of self-destruction. He said that there is not a single place in the world where British affairs have not been handled improperly, and Britain's strength and reputation are sadly declining. Maintaining a force of 100,000 British troops in Palestine is the most pointless and foolish act. No country in the world has destroyed itself like Britain.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ayr, Scotland, 16th] Churchill tonight delivered a political speech to 6,000 people here, sharply questioning whether the Labor government intended to apply for another loan from the United States to resolve Britain's political and economic difficulties. It is said that little remains of Britain's previous loan, which has all been wasted on various unnecessary projects, which is unwise. A large military force should be maintained, but the costly garrison in Palestine is unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Change of Hong Kong Governor - Yang Muqi Retires and Returns to England</h3>
<p>New Governor Maitland Sneddon Scheduled to Take Office Next Month</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 17th] Sir Mark Young, the retiring Governor of Hong Kong, left for England on the British ship "Stradnago" on the 17th with his family. The post of Governor of Hong Kong is temporarily being filled by Colonial Secretary McDougall. The new Governor of Hong Kong, Maitland Sneddon, will come to Hong Kong in June. According to reports, Yang Muqi took office as Governor of Hong Kong in October 1941. Before three months had passed, the Pacific War broke out. After the fall of Hong Kong on Christmas Day in December 1941, Yang was captured and detained in concentration camps in Taiwan and Shenyang with the "Hero of Bataan," US General Wainwright, and other senior officials of the Allied countries. After the victory, Yang returned home and took office as Governor of Hong Kong again in May 1946.</p>

<h3>Rumor Mountbatten Will Suggest - Britain Withdraw Early from India - India Adopts Stern Measures to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The Daily Mail reported that if the talks do not reach an agreement with the Indian leaders on the transfer mechanism regarding the handover of power in India, Governor-General Mountbatten will advocate implementing the handover earlier than the originally scheduled date of June 1948. Judging from the statement issued by Governor-General Mountbatten's advisor, Lord Ismay, that the Indian administrative work is on the verge of collapse, it has become clear that Mountbatten's efforts to unite the Indian leaders have failed. Therefore, the cabinet has cabled Mountbatten to return home for a final consultation next week. It is reported that a transfer mechanism will be set up to prevent India from falling into civil war.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 16th] A responsible person here recently stated that, in view of the increasingly tense situation and the deep fear that the declaration of India's political status will cause religious conflicts to re-emerge, the Indian authorities are taking stern measures to maintain order throughout the country. Once unrest occurs, all troops will be mobilized immediately.</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses Greek Issue; US and Soviet Representatives Clash; Balkan Investigation Committee Divided</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] The United Nations Security Council convened today at the written request of the Soviet Union to discuss the Greek issue. Representatives of various countries engaged in heated debate. When the Yugoslav representative was presenting his views, the US representative, Johnson, suddenly interrupted, requesting the chair to ask the Yugoslav representative to limit the scope of his remarks to the issue under discussion, and not to make lengthy attacks on Greece. The Soviet representative then intervened, asking the chair to request the US representative not to interrupt the Yugoslav representative's speech. The Belgian representative, Langehove, supported the establishment of an auxiliary committee by the Balkan Fact-Finding Committee, stating that the Fact-Finding Committee has the power to appoint an auxiliary committee, but prior approval from the Security Council is required. Although this is a simple matter, it is important because it will set a precedent in the Security Council, and he hoped that the Security Council would carefully consider this issue. The Yugoslav representative protested against the Fact-Finding Committee's decision to appoint an auxiliary committee, stating that the Fact-Finding Committee had exceeded its authority in making this decision. The validity of the Fact-Finding Committee's report is also questionable because it includes the accusations of the Greek government without considering the other side of the issue. Finally, Gromyko requested the Security Council to re-examine the entire Greek issue, and the meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 16th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that the work of the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Committee may not be concluded soon. The representatives have had extremely divergent opinions, and therefore have been unable to draft a joint report. It is possible that each person will draft an individual conclusion.</p>

<h3>US House Committee to Discuss Next Year's Naval Budget; 11% Cut from Truman's Original Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] The House Appropriations Committee today submitted the amendment to the naval budget for the next fiscal year to the House for discussion next week. The total amount is $3,135,481,000, a reduction of 11% from President Truman's original proposal, which is more than $377 million, and a reduction of $1,197 million from this year's budget. After the budget cuts, the strength of the Navy and Marine Corps may be reduced by 40,000 personnel, hundreds of employees will be laid off, and some coastal facilities will be closed. However, the budget will fully allocate funds for naval research and the reserve forces, without any cuts.</p>
<p>Naval Commanders Request More Funding</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] The US House Appropriations Committee is currently studying the naval appropriations bill for 1948. Various naval commanders participated, requesting more funding. The opinions stated by the commanders are as follows: A senior intelligence officer of the US Navy stated that the international situation is "darker than we expected," and he urged the strengthening of intelligence work. Rear Admiral Inglis stated that the Navy Department has once again prepared to immediately restore wartime naval intelligence networks in the event of another emergency. The international situation has prompted an increase in intelligence work, not a decrease. Currently, naval intelligence work is adapting to the development of atomic energy, the popularization of spray planes, and the use of rocket artillery. At the same time, the Navy Department submitted a report to the subcommittee that had been released to the public, stating that, according to naval intelligence, the Soviet Union has taken 10,000 to 20,000 scientists and technicians from Germany to work in Soviet factories. Rear Admiral Lee, Director of Naval Research, stated that the Soviet Union is extremely interested in military research. The Soviet Union's budget for scientific research in 1946 accounted for 943 million rubles, and in 1947 it accounted for 1.226 billion rubles. The Soviet Union's budget and its policies are of a secret nature, and various military research projects may be disguised as other expenses such as educational expenses. At the same time, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal stated that the future "electronic" war is not yet being discussed. The Bikini atomic bomb test has proven that fleets at sea are not victims of atomic bombs. Forrestal also stated that the demobilization plan for the Navy and Marine Corps last year has reduced naval officers and soldiers from 4 million to the current 600,000.</p>
<h3>US and Yugoslavia to Settle Lend-Lease Accounts</h3>

The spokesman continued, "Lend-Lease discussions with China will be held in the 'near future'," but the date is not yet determined. With the exception of the Soviet Union and China, the settlement of Lend-Lease issues with other major powers has been completed.</p>

<h3>US Foreign Relief Plan: Joint Committee of Both Houses Reaches Agreement; Original Amount of $350 Million Maintained</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 16th] The case of President Truman's request for an appropriation of $350 million for foreign relief after the conclusion of the UN Relief Work has been agreed to by a joint committee of both houses of Congress today. According to this item, the relief fund will be allocated to six countries and the Free City of Trieste. The amount had been reduced to $200 million during the House's discussion, but the Senate insisted on allocating the full amount, which led to the convening of the joint committee. After Senate Speaker Vandenberg strongly urged for the full amount to be allocated, the committee made this decision, but the case still needs to be approved by both houses of Congress before it can be formally implemented, with the House acting first and the Senate following. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said: He may submit the case on Wednesday. The plan after the agreement between the two houses stipulates that the scope of application of this relief fund is limited to the following countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Poland, Italy, China, and the Free City of Trieste. However, $15 million can be reserved from the total amount, so that the President can use it for relief to other countries if necessary. In addition, the case also specifies that before the full amount is paid, a relief fund of $75 million can be borrowed from the US Reconstruction Bank. The Senate relented to the amendment proposed by the House to allocate more than $40 million to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, and an agreement was also reached.</p>
<h3>Situation in Vietnam Enters New Phase; Political Solution Expected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Saigon, 17th] Unofficial sources say: The general situation in Vietnam will take a sharp turn for the better, and the restoration of peace is not unexpected. French Defense Minister Coste-Floret declared: The war in Vietnam will come to an end, the French army has completed its work, and the future will be a political issue. French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, is currently in Hanoi. He will explain France's hopes for the future of Vietnam this afternoon. Most people believe that Bollaert can transform military affairs into political affairs. If so, Bollaert will debate with the major Vietnamese parties (including the Viet Minh) to restore peace in Vietnam. Another senior French official, Mr. Mieu, is currently in Tokyo. He is familiar with the situation in Vietnam, and his mission in Tokyo is to find a way to restore peace with Vietnam. Mr. Mieu has met with several confidants of Ho Chi Minh's government in Hanoi and Haiphong. Currently, the seven major right-wing parties in Vietnam have formed an alliance in Hong Kong. King Bao Dai of Annam is the director of the alliance. He advocates that Tokyo, Annam, and Cochinchina must be unified, and Vietnam must have its own autonomous government. French Vietnam is united under the French Federation. Observers believe that if the French government agrees, Bao Dai will form a government to replace Ho Chi Minh's government.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Forming New Italian Cabinet</h3>
<p>Communists Oppose Being Excluded from the Cabinet</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] After being ordered to form a cabinet, Italian Socialist Party leader Nitti today began to implement the organization of a "national concentration" cabinet, attempting to recruit seven or eight political parties and two political elders into the cabinet to save Italy from its current economic crisis. It is heard that Orlando, 87, and Bonomi, 73, have agreed to cooperate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] The Italian Communist Party today rejected Nitti's attempt to exclude the Communist Party from the cabinet. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti said that the Italian Communist Party must remain in any new cabinet. He said that if the Communist Party's political views and plans can be respected, the Communist Party will not oppose Nitti's formation of a cabinet. Nitti and Togliatti's views on economic issues are very different, so the chances of forming a cabinet together are very slim.</p>

<h3>Tetsu Katayama to Become Prime Minister; Liberal Party Agrees</h3>
<p>[International News Service, Tokyo, 17th] Liberal Party Secretary-General Ono went to the Prime Minister's official residence on the 17th after the party's executive meeting to meet with the Cabinet Secretary of the Hayashi Cabinet, and reported the results of the executive meeting. He then resigned and told reporters: Today, the Liberal Party's executive meeting unanimously agreed to support the Socialist Party to become Prime Minister, and intends to seek the general consent of the party at the general meeting of members on the 18th. However, this does not mean that the work of forming a cabinet has been completed, because the issue of cabinet member allocation has not yet been resolved. This point may require another meeting of the secretaries-general of the four parties on the evening of the 18th to discuss. As for whether President Yoshida will still take on the news position, it will depend on his own intentions.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] State Minister Shidehara issued a statement on the political situation, saying: "The method of resolving the political situation should follow the decision of the previous four-party talks, and promote the principle of establishing a united government as much as possible. As for the Prime Minister's issue, although the Socialist Party is the first party, it still cannot control the majority in the Diet." The subtext clearly indicates that he has not yet agreed to Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister.</p>

<h3>Original Informants Sentenced to Prison; Sun Tianchang Declared Not Guilty; Presiding Judge of Military Tribunal Explains Reasons for Judgment; Believes That Even if the Accusations are True, They Do Not Constitute a Crime</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Korean Sun Tianchang, suspected of being a war criminal, was declared not guilty by the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Sun Tianchang, with a background in mechanical technology, established the Precision Crafts Company in Shanghai before the war, manufacturing industrial machines such as lathes and milling machines. After the enemy army occupied Shanghai in 1944, he was designated by the enemy army as a Class B military factory, ordering him to manufacture military equipment. It was confiscated by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau after the victory. In August of last year, citizens Zhou Ganfu and others secretly reported to the Investigation Team that Sun Tianchang was a pro-enemy arms dealer who had donated aircraft to the enemy and contracted to repair the machines in the Jinling Arsenal, and had also used the Moudeli Music Store's main factory, seized by the Japanese army, to purchase coins for the enemy and manufacture military fire. In the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also erected anti-aircraft guns on the roof. After receiving the secret report, the Investigation Team transferred the case to the High Court for trial. When the charge of being a traitor to Australia was not established, it was transferred to the Military Tribunal and prosecuted for suspected war crimes.</p>
<p>After Presiding Judge Li Liangting read out the main text of the "Sun Tianchang Not Guilty" verdict yesterday, he explained the reasons, stating briefly: The prosecution of this case is based on Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, namely, "Supporting the War of Aggression Against the Republic of China." This court believes that when trying whether the defendant has committed this crime, it must</p>
<p>Sun Tianchang (Photo by this Newspaper)</p>
<p>consider two points:</p>
<p>(1) What is supporting a war of aggression? (2) Whether it is intentional support? The so-called support for a war of aggression refers to the behavior that can expand or prolong the war of aggression, which can be said to be support. The various crimes accused in the indictment, in addition to some evidence being insufficient, and some being rebutted by the defendant, can be considered as facts. It may have helped the war of aggression, but it would not have had this impact if it were said to be able to expand or prolong the war of aggression. For example, the erection of anti-aircraft guns has nothing to do with the war of aggression. As for using the Moudeli Music Store to manufacture military fire for the enemy and contracting to repair the Jinling Arsenal, it was found that the defendant's factory was</p>
<p>Managed by the Japanese</p>
<p>and soldiers were sent to monitor it. Therefore, even if it is indeed manufacturing military fire, whether the defendant did it intentionally is still a question. As for the points of purchasing raw materials and purchasing coins, the witnesses failed to provide concrete evidence, and the defendant's accounts were seized by the Third Front Army. If there were such records in them, the Third Front Army should be able to provide them to this court as evidence, but the Third Front Army did not provide them. Regarding the donation of aircraft, the defendant admitted that he had donated 400,000 yuan, but provided evidence that he was forced to donate in the name of national defense donations, and it was not intentional. Moreover, even if this fact exists, it has no important impact on the war of aggression. Furthermore, in terms of criminal law, the defendant had Japanese nationality before the victory of the war, and this kind of behavior cannot constitute a crime. Based on the above points, the verdict of not guilty is given.</p>
<p>Sun Tianchang</p>
<p>was overjoyed when he left the court after hearing the verdict and smiled openly. His relatives and friends, and defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Linzhi, all stepped forward to congratulate him. After the verdict is made in this case, it still needs to be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval, and Sun Tianchang will still be released on the original bail. It is reported that the two original informants in the Sun Tianchang case, Hu Chenggen and Xu Tianxi, were also reported to be traitors and were sentenced to imprisonment as early as January 13. Hu was sentenced to four years and Xu to three years.</p>

<h3>United into a Great Cause; Shipping Industry Rejoices in Revival; Shanghai Shipping Association Concludes Meeting on Xing'an Wheel; Nine Banners for Du Yuesheng</h3>

Twenty-eight units of representatives from various places attended, and more than ten officials, including Director Li of the Ministry of Communications, Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Commander Xuan of the Garrison Department, attended as observers.</p>
<p>First, Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a closing speech, stating briefly: This meeting has proven the aspirations and confidence of representatives from various places to revitalize the Chinese shipping industry, and discussed 62 motions regarding the reorganization of the shipping industry and the maintenance of shipping rights. Today's closing ceremony is held on the Xing'an Wheel, which is not without meaning, because what everyone is always thinking about is the revival of the national fortune, especially the revival of the shipping industry. To achieve this goal, we must gather our collective wisdom and unite together. Therefore, I specially made a couplet: "United into a Great Cause; Shipping Industry Rejoices in Revival" to commemorate this grand event. Speaking of the revival of the national fortune, we must first pay the highest respect to President Chiang's wise and outstanding leadership, especially for the maintenance of the shipping industry. Executive Yuan President Zhang Yuejun, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Chief of the General Staff Chen Cixiu, Minister of Organization Chen Lifu, and Chief of the Transportation Department of the Combined Logistics Headquarters Xi Yichang have all given great help and encouragement to the shipping industry, enabling us to move forward on the road to revival. Therefore, the General Assembly unanimously decided to send a respectful telegram to the officials and present flags at the closing ceremony. The union of the national shipping industry has just begun, and it is deeply believed that it will achieve unlimited success.</p>
<p>Request Japan to</p>
<p>Compensate for Merchant Ships</p>
<p>Director Lu and Director Li gave speeches one after another. Commander Xuan of the Garrison Department arrived at this time and also stood up to give a speech as an official, suggesting two points: (1) Those who value the shipping industry should not seek the development of their own businesses, but concentrate their efforts to jointly develop the entire national shipping industry; (2) Concentrate funds to find ways to build ships themselves, as a century-long plan for the future of the entire national shipping industry. After the speech, nine banners were presented by Du Yuesheng and others, and accepted by Director Lu Jingshi and Director Li Bohou on behalf of the officials. Finally, a respectful telegram was sent to the chairman to pay tribute and a telegram was sent to Supreme Commander MacArthur of the Allied Forces, earnestly and urgently requesting to compensate China with 500,000 tons of Japan's remaining merchant ships, and to strictly limit Japan's subsequent merchant ship tonnage and its scope of activities, to prevent it from threatening world peace again.</p>

Last night at 10 o'clock, two robbers suddenly arrived, one dressed in a black Zhongshan suit and the other in a black top and yellow trousers. After entering the room, they asked if anyone named Deng was present. As Deng was answering, one of the robbers threatened him with a pistol and tied up Deng's fourth sworn brother, Long Dequan, with a rope, forcing Deng to hand over a gold-filled watch and a gold ring, as well as a fake Omega watch. As he was putting them into his pocket, one robber had already walked out of the door, and the robber holding the gun was about to turn around and escape when the victim, Deng Baoshan, rushed forward, grabbed the barrel of the gun, and wrestled with him. Neighbors heard the shouts and rushed over, capturing the robber. At the same time, the security guard had already rushed to report to the Xincheng Police Branch. Zhuo, the head of the branch, summoned all the police officers. On the militia side, under the supervision of Huang Zukang, Deputy Captain Chen, Squad Leader Dong, and Squad Leaders Wu and Tao, eleven militiamen rode in security vehicles to the scene, seizing the robber's revolver and eleven bullets, as well as the original stolen goods.

<h3>Eradicating Opium Addiction: Police and Baojia Liaison Methods Fail to Be Implemented</h3>

The content stipulates that Baojia heads must pay close attention and investigate at all times. If they discover cases of smuggling, manufacturing, selling, storing, or consuming opium, they must immediately report them to the district office, which will handle them jointly with the police branch. If the offender is caught in the act and there is a risk of escape or destruction of evidence, they may directly report it to the police branch for prompt arrest. The police station and district Baojia must strictly keep confidential the cases reported by Baojia heads and the public and must not announce the names of the informants. Each police branch must quickly investigate the cases reported by Baojia heads according to the address. If necessary, the original informant must also assist in the handling and must be handled with caution. They must not be released on the grounds of insufficient evidence or minor offenses, and those who violate this will be investigated. Each police branch must notify the local Jia heads to assist in handling opium cases, regardless of who the informant is, and must create a detailed roster and report the handling situation, sending them to the district office for forwarding to the Civil Affairs Office and announcing them to the public in the Bao office. The distribution and handling of rewards for the seizure of drugs will be handled in accordance with the regulations.</p>

The rest will be paid in full at the time of the final installment, according to the cost of living index published in May. (2) Extra overtime wages will not be discounted. (3) The cost of living index for staff members will be compiled and announced by the municipal government as before. Whether the salaries of staff members in various companies and factories should be discounted and calculated can be handled according to past practice. Those who have calculated wages based on the cost of living index for workers in the past will also be allowed to follow past practice. The municipal government is actively compiling the May index, which is expected to be released around the 25th.</p>

<h3>Despite the Huge Deficit in the Municipal Finance, It Is Decided Not to Open Up New Taxes and Strive for Subsidies for the Shortfall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the adjustment of the salaries of civil servants, the municipal government's expenditure for this year has increased by 9.2 billion yuan. The Municipal Council has decided to request subsidies from the central government by telegram. Due to the recent surge in prices, various bureaus have requested additional budgets, which greatly exceed the original budget. Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongqian told reporters yesterday that tax revenue is currently in a strong month, so it can still be maintained. However, if another month or two passes and it enters a slow month, revenue and expenditure will be unable to balance. There is a huge shortfall in fiscal revenue and expenditure this year. In addition to working hard to rectify tax revenue, it has been decided to strive for subsidies from the central government for the shortfall. At a time when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, there are currently no plans to open up new taxes or adjust tax rates. Director Tian also said that there are no arbitrary taxes in the city. All taxes levied by the Finance Bureau are in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations. The central government originally allowed local governments to open up three special taxes, but the city currently only has the municipal construction donation and the hotel tax. The third type could still be opened up, but the authorities currently have no intention of doing so.</p>
<h3>Speaker Inspects District Administration, Pays Attention to Hygiene and Public Works, How Can Sheds Be Built on Garbage Dumps, The Wire Mesh Walls in Zhabei Should Be Demolished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Councilor Speaker Pan began to personally visit various districts yesterday to understand the local equipment so as to contribute to municipal authorities to seek improvement. Speaker Pan inspected Zhabei and North Railway Station districts in the morning and Hongkou and North Sichuan Road districts in the afternoon. The accompanying persons were Chief Secretary Xiang Changquan, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, and representatives from the Health Bureau and Public Works Bureau. The inspection focused on hygiene and public works facilities.</p>
<p>According to the inspection results, the following points are considered to require urgent improvement: (1) Zhejiang Road Bridge is exclusively for motor vehicles, causing rickshaws and tricycles to gather at both ends of the bridge, affecting traffic. It is hoped that rickshaws and tricycles can be opened to traffic. (2) The road surface on North Tibet Road is severely damaged and almost forms a ditch. It is hoped that it will be repaired urgently. (3) The road surface on Anqing Road is also largely dilapidated, and piles of rubble and garbage have accumulated on both sides, which is also sufficient to affect traffic and hygiene. (4) The wire mesh walls in Zhabei are no longer necessary and should be demolished immediately. At the same time, the garbage problem is also extremely serious. (5) The garbage pile behind Zhe Xing Li on Diswe Road is three or four feet high, and there are even棚戶 built on it, which is very inappropriate. (6) The construction of Qingyun Bridge has only reached half, and it is at a standstill. It is hoped that the other half can be completed.</p>
<p>The Speaker is scheduled to inspect the Tilanqiao and Yulin districts in the morning and the Yangpu and Xinshi districts in the afternoon today.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, when the Speaker was inspecting the Zhabei district, more than 20 representatives of the棚戶 in the district petitioned him, saying that someone claiming to be a landlord was forcing residents to pay three担 of rice in rent every year. However, after investigation, it was found that they were not the landlord, so they requested that justice be done. The Speaker immediately promised to order the relevant authorities to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Summoning Witnesses in the Fubo Case, The Defendant's Lawyer Questions Suspicious Points, Boos Break Out in the Audience, Family Members Become Agitated and Want to Fight the Lawyer When Leaving the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the collision between the Fubo warship and the Haimin passenger ship, which resulted in the sinking of the Fubo warship, the district court opened a court session on the 29th of last month to investigate. On the 12th of this month, Judge Zhong Xianda, who was handling the case, personally went to the Haimin passenger ship to investigate. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Criminal Court No. 2 of the district court summoned the Haimin passenger ship passengers Lin Ruwen, Li Chunling, and Liu Yongnian as witnesses. Lin did not arrive. According to Li Chunling's testimony yesterday, he was traveling from Shantou to Shanghai via Xiamen. On the night of the accident, he had already gone to bed when he suddenly felt a shock. He rushed out of the cabin to investigate and saw a flash of red light, and cries for help immediately arose. He stayed on deck for about an hour and did not see the Haimin passenger ship make any preparations or take any actions to rescue people, so the passengers were angry and scolded without end. Liu Yongnian testified that he came to Shanghai from Xiamen because his child was sick, so he did not sleep late at night. He heard the alarm bell ring twice and felt a shock, so he went up to the deck to investigate and saw that the Fubo warship had sunk by two-thirds. People were floating on the sea surface, but the Haimin passenger ship continued to sail forward. None of the senior officers in the ship came out of the cabin. The passengers discussed it animatedly, and after an hour, they returned to the original location. The defendant Dai Rulin did not propose any motions yesterday. The defense lawyer for the defendant, Wei Wenda, appeared in court on his behalf to listen to the testimony and requested that the court question suspicious points. Because he spoke too much, it aroused the dissatisfaction of the families of the deceased in the audience, and boos broke out. The court ordered the police to stop them. When the questioning was over and the court was adjourned, the audience suddenly became agitated, with continuous cries and wailing. They wanted to fight the defendant's lawyer. The bailiffs did their best to dissuade them, and lawyer Wei Wenda sneaked out of the courtroom through the back door.</p>
<p>In addition, 45 family members of the officers and soldiers who died on the Fubo warship have registered and requested the district court to order the defendant Dai Rulin to compensate them 37 billion, 800 yuan in national currency. 12 more people have now registered, so they have filed a new petition requesting additional compensation of 11 billion, 7,900 yuan in national currency, bringing the total amount to 48 billion, 8,700 yuan in national currency. The reason is that the Haimin passenger ship failed to provide assistance and did not lower the lifeboats to rescue people after the accident. During the previous investigation, the glass on the Haimin passenger ship was not broken, but this time it was found that many glass windows were broken, which was obviously deliberately done afterwards.</p>
<h3>Mees Pierson Appeal Sentence Announced: One Year Imprisonment; Defendant's Ignorance of Our Laws Not Aggravated; Mees Still Dissatisfied, Decides to Appeal to the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mees Pierson, a Dutchman and manager of the Ebbes Company, was found by the Garrison Headquarters to have secretly traded foreign currency after the promulgation of the economic emergency measures by our government. Mees was detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The District Court sentenced Mees to one year of imprisonment. Mees, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court. The prosecutor also appealed, arguing that the original sentence was too lenient. The case was announced yesterday morning at the High Court. US Consul General Anderson, Foreign Minister Frain, legal advisor Zhang Tianyin, Dutch Consul Philip Favis, and the defendant's lawyers Chen Rui and Cai Rudong were all present to hear the verdict. At 9:30 AM, Liu Yugui, the Chief Judge of the High Court's Criminal Division, along with judges Han Shuzhi and Wang Kequan, and Prosecutor Qu Rong, took their seats in the First Criminal Court, and the bailiff brought Mees forward. Chief Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "The original judgment is revoked. Mees Pierson, without government permission, engaged in transactions, receipts, payments, and sales using foreign currency, and is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. US$65,369.71 and HK$20,000 are confiscated." He then announced the reasons for the judgment, stating briefly: "The regulations for punishing the sale and purchase of gold and foreign currency have already been promulgated. According to the law, the new law should be applied for the judgment. Although the prosecutor appealed against the original judgment, considering that the sentence was too lenient, this court believes that the original trial's consideration that the defendant was not familiar with our laws and gave a lighter sentence was still appropriate, so it was not aggravated. If you are not satisfied with this judgment, you can appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days of receiving the judgment." Furthermore, "This court has already ruled to reject the defendant's request for bail. If you are not satisfied, you can also file an appeal to the Supreme Court." It is reported that Mees still expressed dissatisfaction with the High Court's judgment and decided to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3>Universities Establish Scholarships to Encourage Talents in Heavy Industry; Resources Committee is Negotiating</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The Resources Committee, in order to encourage technical and management talents for the extension and establishment of heavy industry, has newly formulated a scholarship method for universities. In the past, the committee had used the same method to select and train many outstanding talents, which had been quite effective, but its significance seemed to focus only on education. The new method formulated this time is different from the past, and it aims to enable outstanding students who are about to graduate to actually participate in national heavy industry construction institutions one year before graduation, to feel a practical interest in the departments they will participate in in the future, and to prepare in advance. It is reported that the scholarships will be given to students in the mechanical, electrical, chemical, mining, metallurgy, geology, and civil engineering departments, as well as in the economics, accounting, business administration, and other departments of universities or graduate schools who are in their final year one year before graduation, and the amount of money will be sufficient for one academic year. The committee plans to notify the universities or independent colleges of the scholarship method before the start of the summer vacation, and then verify it based on the school's selection of the records of the outstanding students in the relevant departments. After the scholarship students are approved, they must enter the factories and mines designated by the committee during the summer vacation to practice and receive guidance from the factories and mines where they are located. Their internship performance may be approved by the school authorities as part of their academic performance or graduation thesis data. It is now known that this scholarship method will be established in a number of domestic universities and independent colleges, and negotiations are actively underway.</p>

<h3>A Strong Force in the World Games: Long-Distance Running, Finland Has Abundant Talent, Hanno is the Most Promising Athlete, His 5,000 and 10,000 Meter Results are Amazing</h3>
<p>[United Press, Helsinki, Finland, 16th] Although Finland's former famous athletes have faded into obscurity due to war or old age, they will still send a strong team to participate in the 1948 World Games to maintain their past reputation in long-distance running. According to training director, Fan Erside: although new talents inevitably lack experience, there is no need to be pessimistic. Finland's most promising athlete is Hanno, who will participate in the 10,000-meter race and the marathon. Last year, Hanno's 5,000-meter time was 14 minutes and 20.4 seconds, which was Finland's best performance last year. Several people closely followed him, only a few seconds behind. Belaera was 14 minutes and 27 seconds. Since Hanno gave up the 5,000-meter race, he is now Finland's top player. In addition, there are several key players whose results are also not weak. Sakama was 14 minutes and 31.6 seconds, Koskela was 14 minutes and 38 seconds, and Makela's result was within 15 minutes, but he did not participate in the competition last year. Hanno will face many strong opponents in the 10,000 meters, including the veteran Maki and many emerging talents. Belaera's result last year was 30 minutes and 31.4 seconds, followed by Javinen, with a time of 30 minutes and 40.8 seconds, Kononen's time was 30 minutes and 50.4 seconds, and Haine Strong was 30 minutes and 55 seconds. The marathon is 26 miles and 385 yards long. In addition to Hanno, Finland's hopes also include Haitana and Munonen, both of whom are currently good players, and there are no fewer than forty others with slightly lower results who are actively training. Finland won the marathon championship in 1920 and 1924, but has not won it since, so they are paying special attention to this event, determined to raise the flag again and win.</p>

<h3>Problem of Securities and Futures Commission Changing to Pay in US Dollar Bonds - Transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for Approval - No Normal Transactions Opened in the Market Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the instructions from the Ministry of Finance and Economics that all substitute deposits for margin from securities exchange brokers and substitute deposits for margin for spot trading should be changed to US dollar bonds, the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association were sent to the Securities and Exchange Authority yesterday. After the Securities and Exchange Authority convened a meeting of the Standing Council, it agreed to convey the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association to the Securities and Exchange Supervision Office for transfer to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for approval. Before approval is obtained, the old method will still be followed. The market prices of stocks in the securities market finally opened at the closing prices of the previous day at around 12:00 noon, and continued until 12:30 when the market closed, but there were no transactions. The Brokers Association held a temporary general meeting of all members yesterday afternoon at 2:30 to discuss until the meeting adjourned at around 5:00. The atmosphere at the meeting was hopeful that the market would open as usual tomorrow.</p>
<p>Brokers' Opinions Can Be Summarized Into Two Points</p>
<p>The main opinions formulated by the brokers can be summarized into two points: (1) In order to support the government's implementation of economic policies, they are willing to subscribe for US dollar bonds worth 30 million yuan for the substitute deposits for identity margin in installments. (2) For the substitute deposits for margin for spot trading, it should be requested that, in accordance with the current Securities Exchange Regulations, they should still be allowed to pay and offset with both valuable securities (i.e., the 26 stocks currently listed) and US dollar bonds (according to the face value). The Brokers Association will send these opinions to the Securities and Exchange Authority.</p>
<p>The Exchange Authority Advised to Open the Market as Usual</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Authority convened a meeting of the Standing Council at around 9:00 AM yesterday. Du Yue Sheng, Wang Zhishen, Xu Jiguang, Zhuang Shuhao, Yue Jigang, and Zheng Xiaozhou were present. Chairman Du presided over the meeting. Chen Jingmin, Chairman of the Brokers Association, also attended to report the opinions of the brokers. The discussion then began and adjourned at 11:30. It was decided to transfer the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for approval. Before approval is obtained, the old method will still be followed. In addition to formally replying to the Brokers Association, it was also decided that the market would open for trading yesterday morning, and the time would be temporarily extended to 1:30. After the meeting, Du and Wang walked into the market and personally conveyed this decision to the brokers' agents, instructing them to open the market as usual for the time being. At around 12:00, the stock prices of each stock opened at the closing prices of the previous day, and the market closed at 12:30, with no trading volume.</p>
<p>Held a General Meeting in the Afternoon to Discuss the Opening of the Market</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, the Brokers Association held a temporary general meeting of all members in the Securities Exchange market rest room. More than 100 members attended. Chairman Chen Jingmin of the Association presided over the meeting. Chen reported on the consultation and efforts made by the Association after receiving the instructions from the Securities and Exchange Authority, and the instructions given by Director Du and General Manager Wang of the Securities and Exchange Authority. The brokers present then had a thorough discussion on the issue of the market opening on Monday, and summarized their opinions: (1) Before the Ministry of Finance and Economics has a definitive answer to the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association, there may be two phenomena when the market opens on Monday: (A) It will still maintain the situation of having prices but no market between 12:00 and 12:30 yesterday, (B) There may be a sharp rise or fall. (2) Before the Ministry of Finance and Economics has a definitive approval, the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association cannot be guaranteed to be realized, and the market should be temporarily suspended. (3) The sharp rise and fall of stock prices in the securities market has already affected the stability of the entire financial and social system. It is hoped that the measures taken by the brokers should be based on social welfare to avoid losing social sympathy. (4) Since the Securities and Exchange Authority has agreed to submit the opinions formulated by the Brokers Association to the Ministry, and will continue to handle the matter according to the old method before the Ministry's instructions arrive, it seems that the Securities and Exchange Authority has also exhausted its human efforts and should open the market as usual. The brokers expressed their opinions one after another, and the meeting did not end until around 5:00.</p>
<p>Supervisory Officer Arrived One Day Late When Receiving the Ministry Order</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Securities and Exchange Authority, the Securities and Exchange Authority received the Ministry's order on the 15th, but the Supervisory Officer of the Ministry of Finance and Economics stationed at the Securities and Exchange Authority only received the Ministry's order on the 16th, so the Brokers Association was only notified yesterday afternoon. He said that this Ministry's order to change the method of paying margin is not as strict as rumored. In fact, if there are difficulties in complying, the government and the Securities and Exchange Authority will never enforce it. Moreover, the solution to all difficulties depends on open discussions between the two parties, and it will not be difficult to solve them. He believes that the situation of the securities market opening yesterday was caused by a misunderstanding, and he believes that the situation will be restored to normal on Monday.</p>
<p>Wang Aotang, the supervisory officer sent by the Ministry of Finance to the Securities and Exchange Authority, also told reporters: The Ministry's order was indeed only received on the 16th. However, because he does not understand the intention and policy of the Ministry's promulgation of this measure, he is not in a position to express any opinions. However, the opinions transferred to the Brokers Association by the Securities and Exchange Authority were submitted to the Ministry of Finance by telegram yesterday afternoon, and under normal circumstances, a reply is expected to arrive within a week.</p>
<p>Fundraising and Sales Committee Declares That This Measure is Not a Forced Contribution</p>
<p>Fan Heyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the US Dollar Bond Fundraising and Sales Committee, made a special statement yesterday regarding the Ministry of Finance and Economics' decision that securities exchange brokers should pay margin with US dollar bonds: The Ministry of Finance and Economics' explicit order was issued after careful consideration, and the method is very appropriate. From the standpoint of bond fundraising and sales, this measure is not a forced contribution. Recalling the stock market turmoil more than 20 years ago, company stocks were used as collateral, which led to serious consequences. Now, in order to stabilize the securities market, using US dollar bonds as substitutes to replace the original stocks is actually safer. US dollar bonds are not affected by the rise and fall of stock prices themselves, and can provide more reliable guarantees. Moreover, the current rise in stock prices seems to have exceeded the price index. However, if the margin is immediately converted into bonds in full, it may stimulate stock prices. He firmly believes that the Securities and Exchange Authority will be able to consider the most appropriate situation and implement the measures smoothly. He suggests that it may be possible to pay in installments.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Declined, Foreign Stocks Suspended</h3>
<p>Government bonds were initially weak and then recovered yesterday. Unified Bing opened at 14,000 yuan, but retail investors still felt weak, and it fell back to 13,700 yuan. Rooms 560 and 503 and others took advantage of the low price to enter the market, and gradually recovered to 15,600 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The transaction volume was about 5-6 million. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A and B fell by 900 yuan each, C and D fell by 1,300 yuan, and Unified Wu also fell by 1,000 yuan. Foreign stocks were also affected by Chinese stocks yesterday and announced the suspension of trading.</p>
<h3>National Bank Discount Committee Discussed Loan Applications</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank Discount Committee Industrial Loan Review Committee held a meeting at around 9:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Zhu Tongjiu. Seventeen cases were discussed, and it is said that most of them can be approved. For some loan applications, the committee reduced the amount based on the Discount Regulations and the actual situation of the loan application. It is said that the amount of loans approved is roughly half of the loan amount.</p>
<h3>Measures for Export Goods Funds - The Four Banks Joint Office Revised and Published - And Revised Measures for Export Bills of Lading for Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>In order to dredge the source of goods and encourage exports, the Four Banks Joint Office previously formulated two types of measures: the measures for allowing various bank branches to handle bills of lading loans and the measures for the Central Bank to handle re-pledge and re-endorsement loans for export goods, which were implemented separately. Now that these two measures have been implemented for a long time, some of the regulations are no longer suitable for the current economic situation. Therefore, the National Bank branch has re-formulated the measures for handling export goods loans and the measures for the National Bank branch to assist in the marketing of daily necessities, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Measures for Export Goods Loans</p>
<p>(1) Target: Exporters who are directly engaged in exporting goods and have joined the local trade association can apply for handling endorsement, overdraft, and advance payments for the purchase of export goods in the mainland, sorting, lifting, and delivering to the port, or waiting for export at the port, and need to rotate funds.</p>
<p>(2) Deadline: The loan period is limited to the actual period required for purchasing, sorting, packaging, refining, or transporting. It shall be handled by determining the period for each item of endorsement, overdraft, and advance payment. However, the total period before and after shall not exceed 90 days. If a foreign letter of credit has been received but cannot be exported immediately, it can be converted into a short-term packaging loan, and its period shall not exceed 30 days.</p>
<p>(3) Quota: The loan quota is 500 million yuan in national currency or 50 million yuan in circulating currency for each transaction. Each bank branch can do it first and then report it. If it exceeds this quota, it should be submitted to the case for approval before it can be undertaken.</p>
<p>(4) Discount: The discount for collateral is based on the cost of the export goods of the industry, with a maximum of 70% as collateral.</p>
<p>(5) Interest rate: In order to encourage the export of goods, the interest rate of this loan shall not exceed 3.6% per month. In addition to the exchange rate, no other fees shall be charged. However, each bank branch should handle it carefully. If there is a situation where funds are borrowed but not exported, all interest from the date of the loan shall be calculated three times, and the loan shall be recovered immediately, and the qualification for applying for a loan in the future shall be canceled.</p>
<p>(6) Exchange rate: The endorsement exchange rate is calculated according to the exchange rate set by each bank branch in the local area.</p>
<p>(7) Re-pledge: This loan can be re-pledged and re-endorsed to the local National Bank, calculated at 70% of the original loan, and the interest rate is calculated at one-half of the original loan interest rate.</p>
<p>(8) Others: The underwriting bank branch should pay close attention to the foreign market prices of various export goods. If the market price is strong, it should urge exports as much as possible, do more endorsement, and tighten advance payments to regulate.</p>
<p>(9) Implementation: These measures will be implemented after being approved by the Four Banks Joint Office Board of Directors.</p>
<p>(2) Measures for Export Bills of Lading for Daily Necessities</p>
<p>(1) Target: For transportation companies that need to purchase daily necessities and transport them to various places and need rotating funds, they can apply to the local bank branch for handling import and export endorsements. (The scope of daily necessities is in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of Finance, Cai Gengyi, No. 18288, which are food, cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cotton fabrics, leather, edible salt, edible sugar, edible oil, paper, soap, alkali, matches, medicine, etc.)</p>
<p>(2) Deadline: The endorsement period depends on the transportation situation. All Shanghai endorsements shall not exceed 25 days in Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yichang, and Shashi, and shall not exceed 30 days in Chongqing and Yingkou (Chongqing may be extended to 45 days during the shallow water season). Other places shall not exceed 20 days.</p>
<p>(3) Quota: The endorsement amount for each transaction is 500 million yuan in national currency or 50 million yuan in circulating currency. Each bank branch can do it first and then report it. If it exceeds this quota, it should be submitted to the case for approval before it can be undertaken.</p>
<p>(4) Discount: The endorsement discount is based on the cost of the collateral, with a maximum of 70% as collateral.</p>
<p>(5) Interest rate: The principle is that it should not exceed 3.6% per month, and in addition to the exchange rate, no other fees shall be charged.</p>
<p>(6) Endorsement: The underwriting bank branch may re-endorse the loan to the local National Bank at 70% of the original loan, and the interest rate is calculated at one-half.</p>
<h3>Weak Demand and Little Trading - Rice Market Stable with a Hint of Weakness - Flour Market Weak and Declining Gradually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total supply in the North and South markets was about 7,400 dan, but the market was still sluggish, and the situation was stable with a hint of weakness. Middle and lower japonica rice is still in a sluggish state, and middle and lower early rice also had little trading. Indica rice was average, and Bai Yin Yuan was also high and stable but slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Flour is declining gradually. New wheat will be seen in the Shanghai area in two weeks, the Beijing-Shanghai line will be available in three weeks, and Kunshan will also be able to produce new wheat, so the market is weak and continues to fall sharply by 4,000-5,000 yuan. The factories are still open, the actual sales are slightly moving, and the price is temporarily stable. Bean cake was weak in the morning and stable in the afternoon, with no major changes.</p>
<p>The situation in Shantou is mixed, with very little fluctuation. Crude oil rose sharply by 5,000-10,000 yuan due to the acceptance of Guangbang. Bean oil factories can still supply the source, and it fell back by 10,000 yuan. Clear oil also fell by 5,000-6,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil was also weak. Large-cart sesame oil was overstocked, while small-cart sesame oil was scarce and firm.</p>
<p>Mung beans are still dull and lack trading. High-quality soybeans are still stable, while middle and lower qualities are still slightly reduced by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Sesame is not selling well, and short-cut sesame is reduced by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are being handled by Guangdong, and they have risen sharply by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum stations and bureaus, corn Yutao Island are moving, and they have increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Stabilize</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rice prices have stabilized. According to Ji Mingzhai, director of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, there may be a period of stability. During the spring plowing, silkworm busy season, and rice transplanting season in rural areas, there will be less goods arriving. New grain usually appears around the Double Ten Festival, so the real period of scarcity will be in July and August. However, at that time, the Yangtze River will rise, and Sichuan rice can be transported downstream. On the one hand, there will be imported rice to supplement, which can be maintained.</p>
<p>Please Issue Wheat Loans</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At the second meeting of the Price Evaluation Committee a few days ago, it was resolved to request the Central Government to issue this year's wheat loans within half a month. It is reported that last year's wheat loans were determined in April together with grain loans. Later, due to the grain loan case, the organizers of the wheat loan were extremely cautious in drafting the terms, and it was delayed until August before it was issued. However, at this time, the wheat order had passed, and the flour manufacturers did not need loans. The wheat arriving in various places mostly fell into the hands of wealthy third parties. This has a great relationship with the high prices of wheat and flour. The manufacturers have also stopped work one after another due to the lack of raw materials, and have fallen into a situation where they cannot maintain themselves. This year will be May, with this lesson learned first, in order to avoid repeating the same mistake and for the survival of manufacturers and future grain prices, we specially ask the Central Government to issue loans as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dye Works Making Profits Outside of Core Business; Cotton Yarn Market Sentiment Regains Excitement — Cotton Cloth Prices Show Mixed Trends of Rise and Fall —</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions: At the opening, due to the stagnation of the Chinese stock market, people were weak and timid, and quotations lacked excitement. Later, dyeing and weaving factories in this street made up for losses, and external idle funds also came in to absorb inventory, suddenly causing the market sentiment to turn firm. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 12.15 million to 12.35 million yuan, a continuous increase of 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was priced at 7.15 million yuan, also up 300,000 yuan. The prices of other yarn counts all increased compared to the previous day, ranging from 120,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market also lacked energy at the opening yesterday due to the securities market shutdown. Subsequently, with easing credit, dye works absorbed inventory at low prices, and idle funds also arrived, making purchases continuously. Market prices began to soar. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to 274,500 yuan, but eventually reached 286,000 yuan, only a slight increase of 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a large supply of Five Blessings fine cloth in stock, with prices down 3,000 yuan. Yuan cloth, Yuan twill, and blue cloth, etc., were also lower, ranging from 5,000 to 120,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, fine twill, poplin, etc., rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, up to 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Restores Allotment; Yesterday's Market Falls Back by One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The rayon market yesterday fell sharply by one million yuan compared to the previous day because the Central Trust Bureau decided to resume rayon allotment to the silk weaving industry starting next week, and it was expected that the joint venture company would also release raw silk. Therefore, people's sentiment was exceptionally weak. 120-count High Gloss, opened low, with no one interested at 7 million yuan, and then continued to soften, with the lowest bid at 6.7 million yuan, eventually fluctuating to close at the opening price. In the afternoon, due to a lack of supply, the price was bid up to 7.2 million yuan. Toyo Gold Three Horses, etc., all declined, and 75-count Semi-Gloss was also bid down by one million yuan.</p>
<p>Although the silk filature market lacked transactions yesterday, calculating the future cost of new silk still required exceeding the market price. Therefore, holders insisted on raising prices, with quotations rising uniformly. Especially for A-grade stocks, which were extremely scarce, the quoted price was higher, reaching 22 million yuan. C-grade was quoted at 21 million yuan, and high uniformity was quoted separately at 20.05 million yuan. However, there were no transactions. Dry filature prices also rose by 500,000 yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>The silk market was slightly stagnant yesterday. Hua Jin crepe and matte spun silk, etc., saw their market prices decrease slightly by 500 to 1,000 yuan due to the decrease in rayon prices. Comforter cover prices remained unchanged. Da Cheng checkered Bi crepe sold for 30,800 to 1,000 yuan, slightly lower than the latter market on the previous day. The Monday term traded at 1,200 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw mixed ups and downs, with a steady trend. The association's Peruvian sugar initially went for 385,000 yuan, then to 395,000 yuan, and after 400,500 yuan it slightly loosened, going for 395,000 to 398,000 yuan, finally settling at 400,500 yuan, up by over 10,000 yuan. 24 Coarse White spot goods were priced at 425,000 yuan, and warehouse receipts at 400,500 yuan. 20 Medium White spot goods were priced at 380,000 yuan, down by a small amount. Warehouse receipts were priced at 365,000 yuan. 4.5 Semi-Military White spot goods were priced at 400,000 yuan, and 3.5 Semi-Military White warehouse receipts at 380,000 yuan. Taiwanese Red warehouse receipts were priced at 315,000 to 310,000 yuan. Tianjin Qing was priced at 260,000 yuan, and Shunde Qing at 255,000 to 250,000 yuan, both down by 5,000 yuan. Xinghua Red was priced at 275,000 yuan, and high-quality goods at 280,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Dyeing and Weaving Industry Requests Revision of Measures for Transshipping Cloth to Hankou</h3>
<p>The eight associations of the cotton cloth association and the machinery dyeing and weaving industry in this city are quite dissatisfied with the authorities' recent regulations on transshipping yarn and cloth, particularly the special control over Hankou. Yesterday, Pan Shih-hao and Wu Guo-bin, chairman of the Textile Control Committee, stated three points: (1) The control of yarn and cloth has spread throughout the country. It is inappropriate to impose special control over Hankou in this regulation. Because Hankou is the central location of the interior, it is inconvenient for various merchants from the interior to come to Shanghai, and most go to Hankou to purchase goods. Special control over Hankou would inconvenience these merchants. (2) The customs declaration system should be revised. (3) Niche goods such as patterned cloth and fine flannel are mostly produced by small factories and should be treated as exceptions. Mayor Wu agreed to submit the first point for discussion at the next Textile Control Committee meeting. For the second point, the customs declaration, which is a technical issue, he instructed Pan to contact Liu Wen-teng, the director of the Textile Control Committee's business department. For the third point, the issue of niche goods, Wu agreed to have Liu Wen-teng study and handle it.</p>
<h3>Orchid Bamboo Branches Slightly Slack</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of orchid bamboo branches have been relatively slow, and merchants are not greedy. The current firm opened dozens of boxes. Kui orchid bamboo was priced at 760,000 yuan, and ordinary orchid bamboo at 520,000 yuan, both down by 120,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates in Fuzhou, Changsha, and Other Places Are Adjusted Regularly; Internal Exchange Rate Panel of National Banks and Bureaus Decides</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 38th panel meeting on internal exchange business of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury was held yesterday afternoon at the business bureau of the Central Bank. Based on the results of inquiries from the branches of the Bank of China in various locations regarding the internal exchange situation, it was decided to adjust the exchange rates for the following locations starting from the 19th of this month.</p>
<p>Specifically, Fuzhou will charge 80 yuan per thousand yuan (previously 95 yuan). Changsha, Hengyang, and other locations in the Hunan region will all charge 50 yuan (previously 75 yuan). All locations in the Henan region will charge 50 yuan (previously 75 yuan). Lianyungang (Xinpu) will charge 12 yuan (previously 10 yuan). Hankou and Wuchang in the Hubei region will both charge 30 yuan (previously 65 yuan). Shashi and other locations will all charge 50 yuan (previously 75 yuan). Hangzhou will charge 2 yuan (previously 3 yuan). Chongqing will charge 10 yuan (previously 15 yuan). Xufu and Wanxian will both charge 50 yuan (previously 40 yuan). The Shanxi region will charge 10 yuan (previously 5 yuan). Guizhou and Yunnan will both charge 40 yuan (previously 30 yuan).</p>
<p>It was also learned that, according to investigations, funds are still tight in the markets of Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places, so the original rates will be maintained at 95 yuan. Yesterday, the internal exchange rates of commercial banks and firms were 100 to 120 yuan in Guangzhou, 20 yuan in Xi'an, and 30 to 45 yuan in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Valedine Sales are Brisk</h3>
<p>Valedine has been selling briskly lately, and merchants from various places have been continuously demanding it. The tailoring of Western suits and the sale of materials for Chinese clothing have both been lively. Due to the shortage of feather yarn tweed, the market sales are even more prosperous than in previous years. Furthermore, the lack of striped valedine has led to increased sales of rice-yellow and gray plain colors. Sales of American goods have been quite strong, but recently, due to the dark colors, transactions have been less frequent. Dark blue is only sold for upper garments, so sales have been sluggish, and the price is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per yard lower than gray. Yesterday, ordinary local valedine was selling for 220,000 to 230,000 yuan per yard, American goods for 200,000 yuan, and British goods for around 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Weak and Unable to Revive; Si'an Newly Fried Green Tea is Highly Priced</h3>
<p>Chinese tea has always occupied a considerable position in the international market, but currently, overseas offers are frequently shrinking. The production cost of Chinese tea is increasing daily due to the rising prices of all goods, threatening exports. Recently, the situation has become even more dire, with no signs of revival. Those engaged in this industry are gradually becoming unable to sustain themselves due to the freezing of funds.</p>
<p>It is learned that people in the industry are eagerly hoping for assistance from the authorities to save them from a serious crisis. As for the various domestic sales of tea varieties, stores and merchants in this street have been involved in them in the past week. The process is in equilibrium between supply and demand, and there is still a lack of volatility. However, among them, jasmine tea, baked tea, and this year's Wenzhou new flag gun tea are relatively firm because both production and inventory are low. It is also learned that Si'an's newly fried green tea has suddenly attracted attention in Tianjin and other places, but the sellers are asking for exorbitant prices, demanding as high as 800,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the high price, and actual transactions are rare.</p>
<h3>Salt Insurance Premium Rate Increased by 1.5 Yuan; Insurance Companies Refuse to Accept</h3>
<p>Insurance companies in this city have been suffering losses due to frequent accidents in the water transport of Sichuan-Kang salt, mainly caused by excessive over-insurance. Therefore, various companies have requested the Ministry of Finance to adjust the premium rate. Now, the Salt Administration has verified and approved an increase of 1.5 yuan to the old rate (5 yuan). This was approved by the Ministry of Finance yesterday (16th). However, the adjusted premium rate is too small, and various companies are still unable to underwrite. The authority to stipulate or adjust insurance premium rates originally belongs to the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. This time, the Salt Administration verified and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for approval, so the industry has decided to reject it and has lodged a serious protest with the salt administration authorities.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success, New York</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Luo Bao reports from New York on the 10th, translated by the editorial office of this newspaper</p>
<p>The United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success, New York, has a vibrant atmosphere and a fresh look, sometimes resembling a colored film set, complete with cameras, reflectors, and beautiful women. However, the three thousand employees of the United Nations prefer to call it the "Instrument Factory." Originally, this flat-topped building was the site of the Sperry Gyroscope Co. during the war. Now it has been completely transformed, and no one recognizes it anymore. Only one building in Queen still manufactures secret instruments for the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>The vast space of this "Instrument Factory" has been divided into many small offices and long corridors, with the walls painted in cream or blue-gray.</p>
<p>Offices are Magnificent</p>
<p>The Security Council's office is the most luxurious and visible to the public. Colleagues who need sunlight and fresh air occasionally gaze at the Security Council's magnificent offices to invigorate their tired spirits.</p>
<p>The Security Council meets two or three times a week, and anyone can obtain free admission tickets by calling a day or two before the meeting. Female tour guides from Paris or Chongqing, London or Brooklyn lead visitors to their seats, which number five hundred and fourteen, with chairs covered in tomato-red cushions. Some seats are only a few feet away from the oak conference table where the eleven representatives of the Security Council sit.</p>
<p>Representatives Arrive Late</p>
<p>These representatives often arrive late, fifteen or twenty minutes after the scheduled meeting time, followed by a large group of assistants. They sit down at the outer edge of the horseshoe-shaped conference table, their faces appearing very serious. The two ends of the conference table face the visitors.</p>
<p>The seats of the representatives change monthly. Currently, the British and American representatives sit at one end on the left side of the audience, and the Soviet Union's Gromyko sits at the other end. He often gets angry, shakes his head, or points a pencil at the other end of the conference table, where the British and American representatives sit. When his opponents respond, he sits upright, with a serious demeanor. But no matter what he does, he always attracts the attention of the audience.</p>
<p>Thirty-Nine Year Old Gromyko</p>
<p>Gromyko is only thirty-nine years old this year, and he gives people a dark impression. He usually wears black clothes, has black hair, and his glasses also have black frames. His voice is deep and somber, giving a sense of gloom. When Gromyko is chairman, he speaks fluent English, but when he speaks as the Soviet representative, he speaks Russian and often expresses dissatisfaction with the English translation of his speech.</p>
<p>Translators with Amazing Memory</p>
<p>The translators sit inside the curved conference table. When representatives speak in French, they translate it into English, and when they speak in English, they translate it into French. If a representative speaks in another language, it must be translated into both English and French. These linguists are mostly French. They extract the main points and rely on their amazing memory to translate the lengthy speeches sentence by sentence. They often imitate the gestures of the speakers and often translate satirical and sharp words one by one. Sometimes, they also embellish harsh words that slip out. For example, when one representative accuses another of "lying," it may be translated as "an unfortunate error."</p>
<p>Conference Room White Light Shining</p>
<p>Non-glare indirect light is emitted from the aluminum grid on the ceiling of the conference room, looking like ice trays in an electric refrigerator. Special reflectors are also hidden in the ceiling for news photographers to use when filming. With the flip of a switch, the entire conference room is bathed in brilliant white light, and at the same time, you can hear the sound of cameras clicking around the conference room. At this time, the representatives can remain calm. If the lights suddenly turn on or off while they are speaking, they never miss a single word, knowing that the photographers will not pay attention to their words.</p>
<p>News reporters sit behind the audience seats. Because the lighting is poor, the representatives cannot see them clearly, so they can work calmly. Before each meeting, they are busy talking to representatives from various countries, but half of the reporters are actually doing nothing, just watching the excitement.</p>
<p>This is the best opportunity for Americans to talk to Gromyko. The British representatives hate outsiders interfering with their leisure time, but Gromyko welcomes them. He speaks to anyone. When you ask him about the United Nations, he will tell you that he cannot answer at the moment. Then, he will ask you about recent cases and snippets of American life.</p>
<p>Bar Has Everything</p>
<p>The representatives never drink alcohol in the lounge. There is a bar there with everything from cider to Russian brandy. But the waiters are terribly bored. If Gromyko drank a cocktail before a meeting, it would be telegraphed to newspapers in Western countries as news. He has only drunk a glass of milk in public.</p>
<p>The private lives of the other representatives are also equally serious. But the news reporters are different. After they finish their work, they often gather in the bar and have a good time. Thirty boxes of beverages are supplied here every day. Coca-Cola is the most popular, and orange juice is also quite popular.</p>
<p>Employees with Good Annual Salaries</p>
<p>Half of the United Nations headquarters staff are Americans, but most Americans have been replaced by people from other countries. The next largest number are French, accounting for about 11% of the total staff. The number of Soviet people is very small.</p>
<p>The annual salary of United Nations headquarters staff ranges from a minimum of $1,380 to a maximum of $40,000 paid to Secretary-General Trygve Lie, which is better than the salaries of U.S. government officials and is exempt from income tax.</p>
<p>Currently, 200 temporary employees are hired specifically to assist with all matters related to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the Palestine issue. This meeting is also an excellent program for the audience, but seating is limited to 300, first-come, first-served.</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly is held in a building at the former site of the World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York. From there, take the subway to Lake Success, which requires only one coin. Or you can take an electric train from Pennsylvania Station, which takes about thirty minutes.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of British Withdrawal from India; Partition of India; Indian Political Situation in Evolution</h3>
<p>— By airmail from Delhi on the 2nd; special correspondent of this newspaper Zhou Xiangguang</p>
<p>The internal problem of India — the inability of the Hindu and Muslim religions to reach a satisfactory political solution — has been going on for almost two or three decades. Although there have been meetings between Gandhi and Jinnah, round table conferences in Shimla, and visits to India by Lord Lawrence, the British Cabinet's Secretary of State for India, Alexander, the Minister of Defense, and Cripps, the Minister of Commerce, the deadlock between Hindus and Muslims could not be resolved. Until recently, the British Cabinet announced its withdrawal from India in June 1948, returning power to the Indians. At the same time, it transferred the unexpired term of Viceroy Wavell and replaced him with General Mountbatten. The situation took a sharp turn, and the conflict between Hindus and Muslims became more apparent. Their respective viewpoints became increasingly different. The Indian National Congress, formed mainly by Hindus, hoped for a unified India, which is based on a geographical viewpoint. The Muslim League, organized by Muslims, hoped for the partition of India, establishing Pakistan and Hindustan, because Hindus and Muslims differ in race, language, writing, culture, and customs, and it is feared that it will be difficult to live together permanently. This is based on the standpoint of ethnic strata. Both arguments have their reasons and receive the support of the people of both religions.</p>
<p>Muslim League Hopes for Partition of India</p>
<p>In the 1940 resolution in Lahore, the Muslim League announced that the areas included in the so-called Pakistan referred to the Northwest Frontier Province, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan in northwestern India, and Bengal and Assam in eastern India. If India is divided according to this division, then the two major corners of the triangular Indian landmass will be occupied by the Muslim League. However, the central part of the other corner, such as the two large princely states of Hyderabad and Bhopal, is ruled by Muslims and may have a considerable relationship with Jinnah, with the possibility of uniting with Pakistan in the future. Therefore, in terms of military geography, Pakistan actually has the potential to threaten Hindustan. At the same time, Calcutta in eastern Bengal and Karachi in western Sindh are two of the three major seaports in India. In terms of commercial economy, Pakistan almost controls the hub of Indian trade with the eastern and western oceans. Therefore, since the areas of Pakistan have military and economic advantages, they will inevitably be opposed by the National Congress. However, the power of the Muslim League is also considerable. On the one hand, the Muslim population is about 90 million. Moreover, the Hindu caste system is strict, and the so-called "untouchable class" accounts for 60 million people, who are despised by the "Brahmin class." Islam advocates the equal idea that all humans are brothers. Therefore, the "untouchable class" in Hinduism either converts to Islam or supports the Muslim League. When the Indian interim government was reorganized last year, the Muslim League specially recommended Mr. Mandal, the Secretary-General of the "untouchable class" alliance, as the Minister of Justice. This is the best example to prove that they support the Muslim League. Moreover, the British Cabinet does not want a bloody tragedy to occur in India before its withdrawal. Therefore, it seems to agree to the partition of India between Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<p>Governors of Each Province Will Be Indian</p>
<p>According to news from the Muslim League, Governor-General Mountbatten will soon issue a document stating that in principle, he accepts the plan to partition India into "Hindustan" and "Pakistan." The Muslim League also expects the Viceroy to establish a border committee to delineate the Hindu-majority and Muslim-majority areas. At the same time, he may revise the Indian government organization law, with the Governor-General serving as the constitutional leader and an Indian-Hindu cabinet and a Muslim cabinet responsible to Mountbatten. Regarding the administration of "Hindustan" and "Pakistan," the Governor-General, after consulting with the Indian-Hindu and Muslim cabinets, will be responsible for appointing the governors of each province. In the future, the governors of each province in India will all be Indians. From this, we can see that the trend of partitioning India between Hindus and Muslims seems to have been determined. What is being considered is which of the eleven British-ruled provinces will be governed by the Muslim League.</p>
<p>Jinnah Argues that Bengal and Punjab Must Not Be Divided Again</p>
<p>The National Congress is also unwilling to give up six provinces to the Muslim League as compensation. Thinking that the Muslim League will establish Pakistan in the vast territory of India, some Sikhs may also establish a Sikhstan in the Punjab province of the proposed Pakistan. At the same time, the Hindu and Muslim populations in Bengal province are equal, so how can Hindus be ruled by Muslims? Therefore, the All-India Maha Sabha Party, which is based in Bengal province, advocates that Bengal province must also be partitioned to weaken the power of the Muslim League. Seeing that the situation was not good, Jinnah issued a document on April 30, the eve of the meeting of the National Congress Executive Committee, reiterating that Pakistan includes the six provinces announced by the Muslim League in the past and that Bengal and Punjab provinces must not be divided again. In terms of population, they must migrate to each other, and defense should also be separated. Otherwise, it is difficult to imagine what the overall situation will be like in the future. Less than a few tens of minutes after this statement was issued, Baru, a veteran of the National Congress and the current chairman of the Constituent Assembly, also expressed his opinion, opposing Jinnah's proposal, saying that if Muslims and non-Muslims want to implement partition, they must implement thorough partition, that is, Bengal and Punjab provinces must also be partitioned. Jinnah cannot want both, and so on. Therefore, the conflict between the two sides became more acute, but the problem must be solved. Arguing is not a good thing, so the National Congress invited the old man Gandhi from Bihar province to Delhi under the scorching heat of summer.</p>
<p>Collect Opinions and Submit Them to London for Resolution</p>
<p>Looking at the current development of the situation, there seems to be no problem with Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh provinces belonging to Pakistan, because the cabinets of these three provinces are all formed by the Muslim League. However, the cabinet of the Northwest Frontier Province is presided over by the National Congress. A general election was held last year, and the result was that it did not participate in Pakistan. Therefore, recently, the Muslim League has requested a re-election to solicit public opinion and overthrow the current National Congress cabinet. The situation is developing. In short, the situation between Hindus and Muslims is becoming more and more complicated. Governor-General Mountbatten has to submit their opinions to London for resolution. But what can be decided at present is that the partition of Hindus and Muslims is already determined. The name "India" will also no longer exist in the future.</p>

<h3>The French Political Parties' Overt and Covert Struggles: The Mystery of De Gaulle's Party Formation</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Paris, April 28th. Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>This time, my arrival in Paris coincided with a major political upheaval in France. General de Gaulle delivered two earth-shattering speeches, one on the anniversary of the victory over Germany in Boulogne-Billancourt, and the other on the second anniversary of the liberation of Alsace in Strasbourg. The content of the speeches has already been reported domestically. The gist is dissatisfaction with the current political situation in France, dissatisfaction with the existing constitution, and dissatisfaction with the "spoils system" and irresponsible current cabinet. He reviewed the decline of French party politics after the First World War, warning that today's political situation in France is still following the tragic path of the Reynaud-Daladier era. Therefore, he called for the organization of a "Rally of the French People," advocating fundamental constitutional changes, overthrowing the current situation, and creating a new era for France.</p>
<p>De Gaulle's Meeting with Ramadier</p>
<p>Like a pool of still water disturbed by pebbles, French political society was stirred up. The French Communist Party's newspaper, "L'Humanité," was the first to reveal that De Gaulle was a "yes-man" of Truman's "Greek-Turkish loan," that De Gaulle's mind was full of fascist germs, and that he was dreaming of a French dictatorship. The Socialist Prime Minister Ramadier, after De Gaulle's first speech (March 30th), personally went to visit General de Gaulle at his small white house near Neuilly to exchange views. Afterwards, Ramadier told reporters that he admired General de Gaulle because he was the "hero who saved France," but given his position, it seemed questionable to express opinions completely contrary to the government's goals in front of foreign envoys on the anniversary of the victory over Germany. A week after Ramadier's meeting with De Gaulle, the second speech in Strasbourg, accompanied by "spring thunder" after the rain, rang out again. This time, in addition to the British and Canadian ambassadors, the American ambassador was also present, with an audience of over 20,000 people. In that speech, he formally proposed the plan to "form a party." De Gaulle himself did not call it a "party" because he repeatedly mentioned "opposing the spoils system of party politics, opposing irresponsible coalition cabinets." Therefore, he named it the "Rally of the French People." But since it is a political union of the people, with propositions and ambitions, even if it is not called a "party," in practice, in a democratic country, it is still a political party. French newspapers call De Gaulle's new "party" the RPF (the abbreviation for Rally of the French People).</p>
<p>The question now is: Why does General de Gaulle want to form a party? Who is the target of the party formation? What is the background?</p>
<p>Unveiling the New Banner of Fighting France</p>
<p>Let me start with the era of the war against Germany.</p>
<p>In June 1940, Hitler launched a large-scale invasion of France, and the Maginot Line fell in three weeks. The Reynaud government surrendered. At that time, De Gaulle, as a colonel in the army, acting Deputy Minister of the Army, at the Supreme Defense Council, on the day it was decided to surrender with pain, the meeting was filled with gloom, and everyone could not come up with an idea. Only De Gaulle stood up and shouted: "No." That very day, De Gaulle fled to London and raised the clear banner of "Fighting France."</p>
<p>After the Soviet-German war broke out, the French left, especially the French Communist Party, enthusiastically participated in the war of resistance. At that time, the strength of De Gaulle's leadership was concentrated overseas. At that time, the underground movement in France was led by the French Communist Party and some so-called leftists who sympathized with the Communist Party. They had an organization called the "National Resistance Council," abbreviated as CNL. The CNL also issued a "Combat Program," which was later recognized and approved by De Gaulle.</p>
<p>The "Combat Program" emphasized that the foreign invasion of France was the result of French monopoly capital manipulating French politics. "When the Nazi fascist iron hooves occupied French territory, monopoly capital, trusts, cooperated with Germany and sold out the interests of the country." Therefore, the slogan of the CNL was "Down with Nazi fascism, nationalization of enterprises, liquidation of capitalists." At that time, Communist leader Thorez was staying in Moscow, and his followers manipulated the CNL.</p>
<p>Shortly after the liberation of Paris, De Gaulle led a team of civil and military officials back to Paris. The CNL also came out of the underground movement and into the open. When I first came to Paris the year before last summer, the left and right were still largely united. The Nazis were overthrown, and "French traitors" were brought to trial one by one. In particular, "French traitor" journalists, regardless of age, were ordered to be shot by De Gaulle. Newspapers that published treasonous opinions were confiscated and nationalized. Large trusts such as Renault Motors (Renault, pronounced "uh-no" in French), a part of which cooperated with the German army to produce aircraft, were confiscated and nationalized. Renault himself was arrested and imprisoned. (Later I heard he died in prison, but this has not been confirmed.) Many of the "Combat Program" proposals put forward by the so-called leftists were once vigorously implemented. The French said that many big capitalists at that time hid in the countryside, living in seclusion, fearing that their property would be confiscated, and rushed to buy US dollars. It is said that the reason why the black market for US dollars in Paris has not disappeared to this day is due to that time.</p>
<p>Leading the Left and Right for a Year: A Great Unity</p>
<p>From VE Day to around VE Day a year later, was the period of great unity (or united period) of the left and right under De Gaulle's leadership. The merits and demerits of that time have now become the focus of debate. In a recent press conference, De Gaulle himself boasted quite a bit about the "renaissance atmosphere" of that time. However, the French Socialist Party and the Communist Party, which are in charge of the current cabinet, have attacked the "bad policies" of De Gaulle's administration everywhere. The second day I arrived in Paris, I read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune, and its editorial was titled "Bad Record." The editorial praised De Gaulle as a French national hero, but "unfortunately, the bad record of his administration in 1944 and 1945" ruined De Gaulle's future.</p>
<p>In 1945, I was in Paris. At that time, the political appearance was that the left and right were quite unified. Although the people in power were all De Gaulle's "heroes," the left's combat program was also being implemented step by step. The slogan of state-owned enterprises was very loud, but because capitalists were fleeing, most of the factories were shut down, production was lacking, and even food, daily necessities, and clothing were scarce.</p>
<p>At that time, De Gaulle began to deploy his political power. He greatly increased the treatment of soldiers and increased the huge national defense budget. Some people said that at that time, 2,000 of the most sophisticated houses in Paris were requisitioned by military agencies or soldiers. The "headquarters" of Passy, who originally worked with De Gaulle on "special operations," also appeared publicly at that time. Passy ran a "Research and Statistics Bureau," a news agency, and also handled many of De Gaulle's publicity matters.</p>
<p>Before Stepping Down, the Two Major Parties, the Socialists and Communists, Launched Attacks</p>
<p>At that time, De Gaulle adopted a laissez-faire policy towards government civil servants. The agencies were overstaffed, with many redundant personnel and little efficiency. A few days before De Gaulle stepped down, the newspapers of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party openly accused De Gaulle of hindering the nationalization of enterprises and colluding with the big arms dealer Schneider, "selling out the left's combat program."</p>
<p>Political chaos began at that time. The Socialist Party was the first to break away from De Gaulle's leadership. The Communist Party shouted and made a lot of noise, demanding that De Gaulle "get out." Although at that time, De Gaulle denied the civil rights of Communist leader Thorez (on the grounds that he evaded military service during the war), the French Communist Party firmly controlled the "General Confederation of Labor," and the five million industrial workers in France became strong supporters of the Communist Party. The "Popular Republican Movement," which originally had the closest relationship with General de Gaulle, also had its leadership fall into the hands of Bidault and a group of Catholics because of different views on the constitution.</p>
<p>He Advocates Revising the New Constitution to Correct Past Mistakes</p>
<p>Here, I should describe General de Gaulle's views on the constitution of the French "Fourth Republic." I don't remember the exact date, but it was probably shortly after returning to Paris. At that time, I was in Paris and listened to several of De Gaulle's speeches. He loudly called on the French people to recognize the lessons of the 1940 tragedy. He said: "The suffering of France originated from the fact that the constitution of the Third Republic was too bad. The constitution encouraged party politics, and the cabinet changed a little every three days and a lot every five days. The parties and factions either fought each other or shared the spoils... The national defense budget was reduced, and national defense was lax..." Therefore, he advocated that the new constitution of the "Fourth Republic" should thoroughly correct past mistakes and produce a relatively centralized, effective new constitution that would not create party infighting.</p>
<p>In fact, the constitution of the Fourth Republic, after more than a year of "difficult birth," was finally voted on by the people, and there was not much difference from the era of the Third Republic. In other words, the current French constitution is democratic, not centralized. It is party politics, not oligarchy. The "constitutional norm" of France is still following the old path before 1940, regardless of whether this old path is a "repetition of mistakes" or a broad road.</p>
<p>De Gaulle gave two speeches attacking the new constitution on June 16 and September 29 last year. The two most brilliant sentences were: "The so-called referendum on the new constitution, nine million voters approved, eight million voters rejected, and another eight million voters abstained. How can such a constitution be promulgated and implemented?" But in fact, the new constitution was finally implemented!</p>

(Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Rally of the French People</h3>
<p>The "Rally of the French People" was formally announced on April 14th recently. Before its establishment, De Gaulle had sharply criticized the new constitution in two speeches. He also said that many talented people in France are unable to exert their strengths because they cannot infiltrate the circles of political parties. The current political situation in France is controlled by mediocre and incompetent people or people with ulterior motives. As a result, the Vietnam problem and the Madagascar problem have come one after another, and the government has been overwhelmed. In the past two weeks, how many people has the "Rally of the French People" absorbed? How will the "Rally of the French People" strive for power in the future? It is impossible to know now. Generally speaking, relying on De Gaulle's personal prestige and his immortal achievements of "saving the country single-handedly," he certainly has great appeal to France's spirited youth and to the French military. The day before yesterday, Communist members of parliament proposed to enact laws to prohibit French soldiers from attending De Gaulle's speeches, saying that De Gaulle was in danger of inciting civil war. The French Communist Party's "L'Humanité" also published "insider information" about De Gaulle's collusion with the French army. One day, "L'Humanité" said: "Now, in the French Army General Staff Headquarters, there are two of De Gaulle's offices. What qualifications does he have to openly issue documents and implement measures in the General Staff Headquarters?"</p>
<p>"L'Humanité" also drafted a list of future cabinet members for De Gaulle, titled: "What if De Gaulle comes to power?" The first item on the list was: "Minister of the Interior Passy (De Gaulle's intelligence chief). Minister of National Defense Schneider."</p>
<p>Schneider is a French arms dealer, similar to Krupp in Germany. Some people say that the Schneider and De Gaulle families are related, or have a nepotistic relationship. The French people also believe that all of De Gaulle's political activities are due to Schneider's economic support. Therefore, the political program and policies proposed by De Gaulle each time emphasize national defense and increasing the military budget. Is this kind of argument excessive? Is there a bit of "measuring the heart of a gentleman with the belly of a petty person"? I cannot tell.</p>
<p>However, the consequence of the facts is that the military supports De Gaulle, and arms dealers are also bound to be happy with De Gaulle. After De Gaulle's speech in Strasbourg this time, slogans of "Long live De Gaulle" were written everywhere in Paris. There is also a colorful printed poster, a map of France, with De Gaulle armed with a sword, standing in the middle, with the large characters "Strasbourg" written on it. This poster is almost pasted all over the streets and alleys of Paris. "L'Humanité" estimates that just the printing cost alone would be more than 1.5 million francs. Therefore, its conclusion is: "Where does De Gaulle get this money? Of course, it was supplied by Schneider!"</p>
<p>British Newspapers Say France Needs Stability, Not Change</p>
<p>When Wallace arrived in England, he fired a cannon in London. He said: De Gaulle's formation of a party is a response to Truman's anti-Soviet and anti-communist policy. (Wallace did not mention De Gaulle during his three-day stay in Paris). The day before yesterday, "L'Humanité" published a message saying that De Gaulle's formation of a party was subsidized by the US government. The American reporters here immediately sent the telegram back, and the Paris edition of the Herald Tribune added a note: "A kind of ignorant and tragic propaganda."</p>
<p>There are dozens of newspapers of all kinds in Paris, all with strong "partisan spirit," which is clearly different from Britain and the United States. De Gaulle's own "Le Combat," as well as the Catholic "Le Figaro," which supports De Gaulle, defend De Gaulle every day. The Socialist Party, which started by pleasing everyone, still inherits the tradition of Léon Blum, and its attitude is relatively cautious. Most of France is now in the hands of the Socialist Party, and Prime Minister Ramadier rarely mentions De Gaulle. A few days ago, there was a rumor in Paris that Ramadier visited "Neuilly White Mansion" for the second time at night. The Socialist Party's "Le Populaire" greatly published Ramadier's "denial" the next day.</p>
<p>French President Auriol, a veteran of the Socialist Party, is now on a tour of North Africa and West Africa. On the day the President boarded a ship at the Toulon naval port, De Gaulle's speech was just published. Someone asked Auriol for his opinion on this issue. The President only answered one sentence: "What France needs today is stability, not change."</p>
<p>This sentence coincides with the editorial of the London Times. The Times did not criticize the rights and wrongs of General de Gaulle, but his objective opinion was that "although France's recovery and construction is too slow, it is, in any case, on the road to progress. What France needs is stability, not change." Although these words are too "mature," as a foreign journalist, that's probably all I can say!</p>

<h3>Requesting that Yingshi University be Moved to Huzhou</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Yingshi University was founded during the war, and its campus was originally located in Huzhou to commemorate the revolutionary martyr Chen Yingshi. After the victory, the Ministry of Education changed its plan and ordered it to be moved to Jinhua. I am a student from Huzhou studying in Shanghai. I know that education in Huzhou is developed. Not only do the nearby counties have middle schools, but there are seven secondary schools in the urban area. Many university students from Huzhou study in Shanghai, which shows that Huzhou needs a university very much. I sincerely hope that the Ministry of Education will promote Huzhou's culture and education and revitalize the national spirit by ordering Yingshi University to be moved to Huzhou, so as to match its name with reality. On the one hand, the students of Yingshi University should also agree with this move, so that it will be beneficial. (Xie Zhongzhi)</p>

<h3>On Modern French Painting: Shaping and Reality in Painting</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>The so-called "shaping" in painting ultimately aims at the purification of painting, and is the process of grasping that purity. The so-called purification of painting means the isolation of painting, and also has the significance of reducing painting. Therefore, no matter how we look at any lines on the screen, they are not meant to explain the objects of nature. As mentioned before, the so-called purification of painting aims at grasping the independent world of painting. This world of pure painting does not adopt "nature-object," but can be said to adopt "tablean-object." The so-called natural phenomenon, needless to say, means selecting the natural objects faced by the painter as the subject matter of painting without changing their original form. As mentioned before, it can mean that this is a method of grasping natural objects according to the order of nature without change, and does not clearly define the isolated world of painting or its position. The so-called "tablean-object" does not necessarily mean rejecting all the objects faced by the painter, but simply rejecting the impure attitude of handling them according to the natural order. This point is intended to start from the painting world of the screen first, so that the subject matter being handled has been isolated into the object of painting data, and has been incorporated into the category of painting data. Therefore, even if we do not see the original image of nature in the subject matter, as long as it is a painting image, it is fine. This image does not have to be limited to an abstract image. Even if it has a concrete natural image, it must be said that it is being placed in an isolated category or painting order that is different from the natural order. We specifically call this object that has been placed in the pure painting order "tablean-object."</p>
<p>The reason why we call a "tablean-object" - that is, a "Formation" that forms a pure painting. This Formation is due to pure painting lines, pure painting light colors and composition, making the screen unified into a completed artistic form. The so-called unification of the screen into a completed artistic form is different from being completely artistic. The so-called artistic completeness, although it is the result that can be obtained from an evaluation, the so-called unification of painting into a completed artistic form here is the completion of expression, and is intended to be the end of the creation process. It implies the meaning of separating from the expression of the painter as the creator and becoming a completed artistic form called a work. This is the meaning of "shaping" in painting. After this, the value judgment of painting has become a different world from the "shaping" of painting. Therefore, the so-called painting technique is a pure meaning, and is the painting "formation." Because it has been unified into an artistic form that has been achieved in painting, its mission has been fully completed. This does not mean the disappearance of technique, but that the process of so-called painting "shaping" is sublimated into the so-called artistic form of painting.</p>
<p>We have no doubt that the modern French art scene is trying this kind of painting "shaping," and is exploring the point of pure painting expression. If I start from such a general examination and break into more specific questions, then the so-called purity of modern French painting all belongs to the pursuit of reality in painting. If we see the traces of the pursuit of the natural state of painting in 19th century painting, then current French painting is moving into this world of reality.</p>
<p>The so-called reality in painting must be the unique reality (Verite) of painting that is different from the natural truth. All reality in painting is dedicated to the reality of the artistic world, and is the reality that has been placed in the so-called orderly world of painting. In other words, reality in painting can be said to be reality that has been studied, felt, and established in the so-called total world. This kind of reality is fundamentally separated from the natural, realistic kind of reality, and has artistic joy and artistic beauty. Therefore, we specifically call this reality belonging to the artistic world pseudo-realism. It contains the meaning of the artistic feeling that the artist has, and can be said to be a reality belonging to the aspect of sensibility. Therefore, regarding this kind of reality in painting, it is possible that due to the difference in the painting attitude held by each painter towards painting, different appearances will appear.</p>
<p>We can broadly divide the attitudes seen in the painters of the modern Paris School into the following types:</p>
<p>There is a kind of energy for painting that emphasizes the painter's visual sensibility. They want to express the reality felt by vision in a "painting" way. Therefore, we call it visual realism (Realite de Vision). Although we call it visual realism, it would be inappropriate to equate it with the vision of 19th-century Impressionism because it has the so-called vision. The vision belonging to the Indian School is a mechanical vision that looks at nature realistically, and is neither separated from nature nor has any isolation from itself. That is, there is no artistic isolated attitude, nor is it a vision that is included in the category of the so-called isolated world of painting. It is just a vision that looks at the phenomena given by nature in the state of existence according to nature. However, the vision we call here is a vision that is included in the artistic category, and is a vision that sees things within the scope of the artistic state of existence. The so-called vision that sees things in the artistic state of existence may sound a bit strange, but it is not a vision that sees things in this true natural state, but refers to a kind of vision that has the so-called artistic and painting tendencies.</p>
<p>The second kind of painting attitude is to attach importance to the painter's perceptual sensibility, and want to express the reality felt by perception in a painting way. Therefore, I call it perceptual realism (Realite de Connaisance).</p>
<p>The so-called Comaisance (perception) about painting still means a kind of perception about painting, which is the perception felt when the center of that sensibility is regarded as the intellectually bottom center. This is very strongly manifested in the modern French art scene. At least the point of exploring intellectually bottom sensibility is one of the modern characteristics.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 511</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This indicated that Tsurumi had exhausted his Judo skills. Why did he need to use such a grand maneuver? And what was the purpose of this maneuver? It was because he knew that his opponent must have practiced a special type of footwork, capable of always staying behind the enemy, no matter how you turned, he would always be one step ahead of you, constantly sticking to your back. Therefore, he decided on this method: jumping forward was to lure the opponent to follow, but unexpectedly performing a headstand, somersaulting back to the original spot; this way, no matter what, the opponent could no longer cling to his form. Moreover, the opponent sticking to his back was within a planar range; if he could rise into the air, he could exceed the plane, so in mid-air when turning his body, he should be able to see the opponent's movements.</p>
<p>"Good!" The opponent also cheered.</p>
<p>The person appeared; exactly as Tsurumi had expected, the opponent had jumped past him, following behind, and indeed had not anticipated his splendid performance of the headstand. But something was also truly peculiar; the person had indeed appeared in front of Tsurumi, but the person with two small braids hanging from their head was not just one! It seemed like more than two... three, four... anyway, more than one.</p>
<p>Speaking like this, if it wasn't that Tsurumi's headstand had made his eyes blurred, like the situation after being drunk, unable to see clearly, then this lady must be a demon reincarnated, using a magical technique of creating clones.</p>
<p>Little does anyone know, this set of skills is a minor matter in our Chinese martial arts, not something to be surprised at. This is the footwork of the "Bagua" school in national martial arts. Master Sun Lutang once publicly performed it under the watchful eyes of many in Shanghai. Those who have seen it must still remember. His performance was divided into two styles: one, on a square-foot-sized ground, he could perform various nimble and transformative footwork, either advancing or retreating, only on the square foot of ground. Second, in an empty space of one zhang square, he would spread out the Bagua steps, able to make the audience's eyes dizzy and create several figures. However, Master Sun Lutang's specialty was not the "Bagua" school.</p>
<p>There's no way to talk about these things now. Back then, only a little over a decade ago, at the Temple of Agriculture in Beijing, there were often two experts from the "Bagua" school, practicing there before and after sunrise. Those who had seen them were probably countless. One was Zhang Zichang, Fourth Master Zhang, an old man in his sixties. He was small in stature but full of vigor, agile, and practiced for more than an hour every day.</p>
<p>Watching him walk the Bagua steps, he didn't seem fast, but if you were to boldly try to exchange blows with him, either his figure would disappear in an instant, or his figures would be all around you, shaking around you; it was as if one person had transformed into several. He was the direct descendant of the "Bagua" school, and also the teacher of these sisters.</p>

<h3>Days Without News</h3>
<p>— Ji Gan</p>
<p>A Western saying goes, "There is nothing new under the sun." According to this, there should be no news in the world. However, God created all things, and among these things, there will be activities outside of God's plan. This creates all kinds of strange and new things. The dazzling giant python luring Eve to pluck and eat the fruit of life is news, Eve persuading Adam is also news, and as a result, God angrily drove the couple out of the Garden of Eden, which was especially headline news that shook the universe.</p>
<p>However, any news, after a certain period, will naturally become old news. When God created birds, beasts, and the spiritual beings of mankind, he certainly hoped that they would live together harmoniously and get along well. At this time, suddenly a dog took a bite and bit a spiritual being. Not only did the beasts find this strange, but perhaps even the master of creation was surprised. If there had been newspapers at that time, it would definitely have become sensational news. But as time went on, the number of dog bites increased, and people gradually stopped treating it as news. Thus, some people thought that only humans biting dogs could be considered news.</p>
<p>But later, things like humans biting dogs happened again and again, just like dogs biting people. No one found it strange anymore, because even stranger things were constantly happening. Since the first dog bite, the newsworthiness of various news stories on this earth has climbed through tens of millions of stages. After World War II, newsworthiness has entered a state of rapid development. The things we are accustomed to now would make the ancients stare in amazement. Even if the Pacific Ocean suddenly dried up and the peaks of the Himalayas suddenly flew to the Arctic, it would not make them feel any stranger.</p>
<p>The ancients might say that we are numb, but we would say that they are easily startled. However, when the development of newsworthiness accelerates and exceeds our nervous system's ability to adapt, even the most numb people will be shocked and terrified, living in fear every day. At this time, we cannot help but think of another Western saying, "No news is good news," and pray for a day without news, because that is the news that has not yet happened.</p>
<h3>Bronze Statue of Chen Yingshi</h3>
<p>— Lu Hong</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Yu Ying</h3>
<p>— On the Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>The world is walking at the crossroads of the United Nations and the atomic bomb. The two are incompatible. If humanity chooses the atomic bomb, it will have to put aside the "United Nations"; if it chooses the United Nations, well, the mental threat of the atomic bomb must first be eliminated. Otherwise, the imagined atomic bomb defense line is likely to lead to a third world war.</p>
<p>Einstein, hailed as the "father of the atomic age," once said angrily:</p>
<p>"We must arouse the attention of the public and make them understand the actual situation created by the atomic bomb. Only international action to prevent war can save us, because then there will be no need to prepare for war, or even the possibility of preparing for war."</p>
<p>This means that a great scientist who can see the profound meaning of science believes that the only way to save mankind from the scourge of war is "international action."</p>
<p>Yes, even today we can still hear various reports about the atomic bomb. Some say that the plants near Nagasaki have shown genetic mutations, and that part of the new leaves are white. From this, it can be seen that its impact on human sperm must be significant. Others say that a fire recently broke out at the University of Washington in Seattle, and some firefighters rescued fish buckets containing fish caught from the Bikini Sea. After carefully examining the bodies of those firefighters, it was discovered that they had been exposed to mild radiation.</p>
<p>Recently, the newspapers also reported that some British workers were suffering from "atomic disease." The fact is that rumors are rife among workers at the state-owned secret atomic research station in northern England that they have lost their sexual ability, supposedly due to the impact of atomic fission. This result of sexual impotence has created a serious psychological terror within the workers' families. Perhaps there are no real atomic disease patients, and it is just a matter of self-disturbance. Due to mutual intimidation, Britain may add several mental patients who tremble at the mention of the atomic bomb and sweat profusely when talking about it. This is very possible.</p>
<p>Extensively publicizing the power of new weapons, if this is not a strategic tactic, then it should be due to curiosity. Reports about "the aftermath of the atomic bomb," "atomic disease," and so on, seem to be viewed in this way. If Einstein is right, then we should also take responsibility for preventing any reports that exaggerate the power of the atomic bomb, causing people to have a misconception that the "atomic bomb is omnipotent," or even causing a third world war because of this misconception. —Let people be liberated from the great terror of the atomic bomb, and let the people after the war listen to a Beethoven symphony, which is much more valuable and poetic than "atomic, atomic" all day long.</p>
<p>Letting the world create a large number of neurasthenia patients in the rumors of the atomic bomb, wouldn't this make the Japanese people who died under the atomic bomb snicker? —They are laughing because they just took a step earlier.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York, Americans spend approximately $1 trillion annually on gambling, which is five times the cost of manufacturing the atomic bomb. If this news is not a misrepresentation, I hope that those who excessively publicize the power of the atomic bomb can wake up. Even in the United States, putting the atomic bomb and roulette gambling equipment on the scales, the latter is probably still heavier.</p>
<h3>Color and Psychology</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>Once, a scientist in London invited six friends to a feast at his home. After taking their seats, the dishes were served one after another, very exquisite, and the guests were very happy and had a great appetite. After a few minutes, the color of the lights changed. At first, everyone didn't pay attention. After a few minutes, two guests felt nauseous and couldn't help but vomit. The rest of the people also lost their appetite and got up from their seats. It turned out that the watercress on the table (like raw green onions often found on Chinese tables) turned bright pink, the beef turned greyish-white, the milk turned black, the lettuce turned a terrifying blue, the broad beans turned black, and the peanuts turned crimson. All the food changed from its original color and appearance. It turned out that the guests were the host's experimental subjects. The lights used a spectrum filter to filter out various colors in the spectrum, leaving only red and green. The scientist used this experiment to prove that color has a considerable influence on people's psychology and physiology. Poor guests were innocently subjected to his manipulation.</p>
<p>Color also has a great influence on the life and growth of plants. For example, the seeds of a certain plant need to be exposed to sunlight for ten days before they germinate, but if they are placed under blue glass, they can germinate in two days.</p>
<p>There is a black bridge near London. For many years, there had been a continuous stream of suicides jumping off the bridge. Later, someone suggested repainting the bridge green, and sure enough, the number of suicides was reduced by half. According to some people who study psychology, "The reason for the reduction in suicides is not because green has any effect that can make people happy and forget death, but because it eliminates the melancholic effect of black."</p>
<p>The color of the rooms in the hospital is closely related to the psychology of the patients. Light green in the operating room has a considerable good effect on doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>In courtrooms where criminals are interrogated, shining green light on the prisoners makes it easier to obtain truthful confessions.</p>
<p>Some people experience dizziness and motion sickness on airplanes and ships. It is said that painting the interior blue or green can reduce these effects. The most taboo color is yellow.</p>
<p>Other things, such as the colors of merchandise, must also cater to the psychology of customers.</p>
<h3>Noble Charity</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>Italian film star Isa Miranda became famous in the film industry for her most beautiful and flirtatious eyes. It is unknown how many admirers of her have had their souls captivated by these wonderful eyes.</p>
<p>"A clever smile with bright eyes," the beauty of a beautiful woman indeed lies in this pair of eyes. Normally, this kind of beautiful gaze can only be secretly sent and quietly flown during life. Although a single send and a single fly contain great charm, enough to subvert sentient beings, when life is over and the eyes are closed, its power should also disappear. However, this is not the case. According to a Paris dispatch from the Associated Press on the ninth of this month, Miranda has signed a contract with a certain great medical scientist to donate her most beautiful eyes in the world to science after her death. She is currently filming a French film in Paris. She said that the contract stipulates that after her death, her beautiful and charming brown eyes will be transplanted by doctors into the eye sockets of other blind people.</p>
<p>Although this is a matter after her death, it can be said to be her greatest and noblest act of charity for herself.</p>
<p>A Western philosopher said: "A person comes into this world not to take something away, but to give something to others." If there are no achievements in career and scholarship left for posterity, then generously donate everything you have on your body. This is the noblest act of charity. Compared to "a leopard leaving its skin after death," it is a more meaningful act of charity, because a leopard's leaving its skin is not an automatic signing of a contract.</p>
<p>This Miss Isa Miranda's reservation is truly a wise plan.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, giving up one's body on the Precipice of Self-Sacrifice to save starving animals is said to be an unparalleled act of merit. Miss Isa Miranda's donating her eyes to the blind can also be viewed in this way. Because this is truly the last so-called "glance of longing before leaving."</p>
<p>But I don't know if, when transferred to other people's bodies, they can still captivate souls and subvert sentient beings?</p>
<h3>"Great Autumn Leaf"</h3>
<p>— Feng Qiuping</p>
<p>One of the New Styles of Crochet</p>
<p>The Great Autumn Leaf flower is a newly invented style that cannot be found in previous crocheting books. Its method of tying is mysterious, unique, and different from others. We use two colors, matched and tied together, to make it even more obvious. Other types of woolen garments start from the hem, while the "Great Autumn Leaf" starts from the collar and can be made into long or short garments as desired. The collar and shoulder yoke, the front and back of the body, are all connected together. When crocheting to five inches long in front of the chest, the tips of the autumn leaves are gathered. Below this, mainly plain knitting is used. Now we will publish the "Great Autumn Leaf" pattern in this newspaper for the reference of sisters who love crocheting. Everyone can crochet one piece, a "Great Autumn Leaf" spring outfit for 1947.</p>
<h3>How to Watch an Orchestral Conductor?</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>The conductor occupies a noble leading position in the orchestra. He not only has to express the content of the music correctly and completely, but also has to explore the soul of the music with rich understanding and refined skills in order to achieve a good performance effect.</p>
<p>The most important conditions for conducting technique are: clarity, agility, strength, the ability to control every player and make him a machine of the conductor, and the ability to distinguish the sound of each instrument and correct errors at any time with excellent hearing. Only clumsy conductors flaunt their skills too much, waving their batons randomly, making the audience dizzy and chaotic.</p>
<p>The success of two world-renowned conductors, Toscanini (A. Toscanini) and Stokowski (L. Stokowski), lies in the fact that they are conducting masters who meet the above conditions and are good at understanding creative power. But the most amazing conductor in music history was Mozart. This "music prodigy" composer had a pair of uniquely gifted ears that helped him succeed. Therefore, when he conducted, the players were especially careful and attentive, so nervous that they did not dare to relax a little, because even the slightest incorrect sound from each instrument could not escape his ears.</p>
<p>Orchestral conducting is more difficult and challenging than any other type of conducting. The large number of instruments and performers force him to devote all his energy to the task. To conduct an orchestral performance, one must use the whole body and use various postures to imply the expressions that the players should display. Therefore, people often regard the conductor as a wizard who uses various magical techniques, passing through the use of the baton and hands, to lead out a string of wonderful and moving music.</p>
<p>Here, I will briefly tell music lovers some very common knowledge about watching an orchestral conductor:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to whether the conductor's movements and postures are clear, powerful, agile, and beautiful, and whether they match the music appropriately.</p>
<p>(2) To understand whether the conductor can understand and express the spirit of the music, just listen to whether the music that is played is plain and unremarkable, without any appeal, or moving and touching, captivating the audience.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to whether the conductor can control the entire orchestra, from the stringed instruments in the front to the percussion instruments in the back.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to the gestures and special methods the conductor uses to suggest expression.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to watching the conductor's skills, the audience themselves also needs to have some knowledge of conducting methods, such as the conducting method for four beats, where the first beat goes from top to bottom, the second beat from right to left, the third beat from left to right, and the fourth beat goes diagonally upward from the right to the starting point; the conducting method for three beats forms a triangle, and so on.</p>
<p>(6) Often compare the situations of several different conductors performing the same piece of music. Judge the merits of their conducting skills based on the impressions and sounds you get.</p>
