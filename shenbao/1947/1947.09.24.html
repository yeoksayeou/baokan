<h3>參駐委會建議政府　改善公教人員待遇　取消生補加成依物價指數發薪　立院財經會決議請辦信用借欵</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京廿三日電﹞參政會駐委會廿三日下午三時舉行臨時會，江庸主席，秘書處報吿黃炎培因事不克出席後，即開始（討論：　本會對於對日和約之建議案修正通過，送請政府採擇。　請政府緩期辦理各種選舉案，決議保留。　請政府迅速決定對印尼戰爭之態度，以保華僑生命財產案，決議通過。送請政府切實主意。　請政完轉飭敎部，通令全國各中小學澈氏采用國語授課案，決議通過，送請政府斟酌辦理》　為中信局賤價出售　產，損失國庫，請澈査嚴辦，以警貪汚案，決議通過，送請政府澈査嚴辦。　請速增撥賑款，救濟皖省流亡難民案。　請速增派大員澈底剿滅大別山，黃山匪患，以遏亂源案，以上兩案决義通過，送請政府迅速辦理。　請速撥急賬百憶，救濟河南難民案，決議通過，請政府速撥領款救濟。　請政院妥籌改善公敎人員待遇案，木辦法舉辦生活貸款，以維生活，而勵廣潔案，決議修正通過，送請政府迅速切實辦理。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京廿三日電﹞公敎人員待過之改善問題，廿三”在參政會駐委會亦提出討論，該案係盧前，范予遂，江庸三參員提出「請政院妥籌改善公敎人員待遇根木辦理，並舉辦生活貸款，以維生活，而勵亷潔案」，列舉辦法兩項：　調整發薪辦法，　舉辦生活貸款。討論時各參政員發言者甚多，尹述賢反對該案最力，渠請如實行此項辦法，國庫將負擔數千億元，事實上殆不可能，最後決定將舉辦生活貸款辦法刪除，案由改為「請政院積極改善公敎人員待遇，以維生活，面勵販潔案」，決議修正通過，送請政府迅速切實辦理，該案全文如次：</p>
<p>（理由）八年抗戰廉潔自持之公敎人員，已遭受萬分之苦難，忍痛掙扎，希冀勝利後得到蘇息，乃以共黨稱兵，政府戡亂，致物價飛漲，法幣銳貶，勝利以來，新資雖已作數次調整，實則每調整一次，公敎人員褲帶更需勒緊一次，其家鄉之淪在匪區者，至今無法復員，不但財產蕩然，復受逃亡眷屬威挨之累，自愛之士，已陷於絕境，狡黠之徒，遂不顧一切，馴至貪汚成風，正義消沉，飢餓所驅，世風日下，如不急圖挽救之策，將演成不可收拾之勢。</p>
<p>（辦法）調整發請辦法審　將生活補助費及加成　完全取消，依照物價指數撥給薪俸，　依照物價指數，將薪俸折合實物發給。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京廿三日電﹞立法院財政。經濟兩委會，廿三日晨再開聯席會，審查劉志平等所提　務員貸款案，出席立委十餘人，劉通主席，財次徐柏園亦列席，討論時各立委對公務人員間待遇不一，頗致不滿，並向徐柏園提出質詢多起，由徐分別作答，並說明貸款之困難，一部份委員亦認原辦法所列以房地產作抵一節，以公務員多數為無恒產者，事實亦無法實行，決議改為信用借款。此外，又擬具下列補足辦法，按照主計處所編物價指數發薪，各機關待遇一律平等，實物配給則取消，此案俟廿五日大會通過後，即可向玫府提出。</p>
<h3>中信局賤賣敵產　參駐會提請澈查</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京廿三日電﹞中信局賤賣敵產，致國庫頗受損失事，參政員江庸，武肇煦，姚廷芳等三人，己向參會駐委會提議，請予澈査嚴辦，經廿三日駐委會臨時會通過決議送請政府澈査嚴辦。該案案由為：「爲中央信託局賤價出賣逆產，損失國庫，請澈査嚴辦，以警貪汚案」，據稱：自敵偽產業處理局併入中信局，設立敵偽產業淸理處後，所有上海敵偽逆產，悉由該局一手處理，現經出賣之連產，已不可勝計，査有提籃橋榆林路榆林里日人公大紗廠房屋百廿七幢，聞前敵偽產業處理局於去年九月曾佔價一億四千一百五十八萬七千一百六十八元，今該局於本年五月售與原地主，聞得價僅七千一百四十七萬元，地上權八年，時逾半載，物價增至十倍以上，而賣價反减低一半，謂無中飽，孰能信之，公大紗廠如此，其他該局經手出賣之產，亦難保其必無類似情形，損失國庫，中飽私囊，應請主管機關迅速澈査，如査明屬實，務嚴厲懲辦，以警貪汚，庶現存物資陸續變價出售，亦可少受損失。再該局所保管者，尙未出賣之敵偽房產，除分配各機關外，不少由該局借給親友居住，不收絲毫租金，名曰代為管理，以公家產業作人情，己屬不合，且聞其中亦有明曰借居，實則暗取頂費者，應請一併澈査。凡該局偕給私人住居之房產，其應沒收者，概行出賣，俾利歸國有，其確非運產不應沒收者，速發還原主，勿任鵠巢鳩佔，妨碍業主產權。</p>
<h3>鳥瞰南洋</h3>
<p>— 本特派員吳嘉棠</p>
<p>隨中航機試飛南洋追記之六</p>
<p>記者這次隨中航試航機，在南洋遊歷了西貢，曼谷，新加坡，吧城幾個大城市，前前後後飛了七千哩的行程，雖然來去匆匆，但耳聞目見，頗多感觸：第一個給我最深刻的印象，該是僑胞們對祖國的熱誠，當我們不論飛到任何一個城市的時候，僑胞們初次看到「空中霸王」號身上的「靑天白日滿地紅」國徽和遠道而來的記者們無不歡欣若狂，像在異地遇見家人一般。問長問短，急切的想知道祖國的現况。慚愧的是我們不能帶去了許多動人而値得喜悅的消息。僑胞遭空前難關</p>
<p>第二個印象，我們感覺到僑胞們現在正遭遇到空前的難關：當此南洋各地在高唱民族主義民族目決運動的時候，不幸地我們的僑胞首先陷入了危機重重的環境中，甚至有好多已經走入了「毀滅之途」。我們看到荷印　突中，僑胞在夾縫中遭遇財產的損失和生命的傷亡，這是多麽令人感覺痛心的一件事！</p>
<p>回溯僑胞在南洋開拓的歷史，當以荷印為最早，到現在居留吧城的僑胞，好多已經是六代子孫，甚至有的是八代相傳，他們當初在荷印墾荒，克勤克儉，慢慢地將一片蠻荒海島，改造為目前燦爛奪目的「黃金鳥」，但是時至今日，想不到竟有那麼一個恐怖悲慘的景象，眼看着僑胞們四百年來的心血和建設，一旦在砲火中毀滅得無影無蹤。關於這一點，我們認為印尼人的做法，是一極愚蠢和不智。假使印尼人在這次戰爭中果眞毀滅了僑胞的一切，那末剩下來的是什麽呢？我們不難想像到；將是印尼人倒退了四百年，重新回到了當年「　荒時代」的生活。</p>
<p>所謂「星星之火，可以燎原一，繼續而來的隱憂，我們將顧　到由於印尼人加諸僑胞身上的一切，如何能祖保別的小民族不羣起效尤呢？</p>
<p>凡在我們再回過頭來看看巡羅這一隻角落。近年來僑胞社會中亦已開始受到嚴重的威脅。最近暹政府更計劃把掌握於僑胞手中的米廠（常地人稱為火　），全部收歸國有。遺無異又是給僑胞一個致命的打擊。我們知道過去　羅和西貢的產米，幾乎大部份操縱在僑胞的手裏，如果遲羅的僑胞，一旦失去了所有米廠，其後果自然可想而知了。繼之而來的將是一個破產的危機。</p>
<p>正因為僑胞在海外身受種種創痛，所以特別對祖國寄予莫大的期望。當我們飛臨到上述幾個地方時，僑胞無不懇切的希望有一個强大統一的祖國，至少在現階段應該有一種具體的行動，使他們在南洋能够獲得安居樂業事館，多半因為人手缺乏，工作多　能順利開展。曼谷一地就有八十萬僑胞，而領館人員僅有十五人，並且這八十萬僑胞中，一部份又多散居在各小鎭中。試問這十五位政府工作人員，怎樣能够面面顧到呢？</p>
<p>在目前南洋各地正鬧着排華運動的時候，我國在東南亞的對外宣傳工作，實値得當局格外的注意。我國在這地區中雖無任何企圖，然而這裏是我民族的「窗口」，是我經濟的外圍綫，當地政府與人民的行動皆與我有絕大影響。英美兩國在南洋各大城市都設有新聞處，以照片及文字資料，供給當地報紙，或設立閱覽室，免費供給畫報誌。選種工作我們殊有立即開展的必要。記者以為：我們在東南亞的對外宣傳工作如果做得好，那麼比較我國在美在英的國際宣傳，更可收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>南洋各地的人民對我國的一切問題，在目前根本就不能了解。中航機在曼谷降洛後，遷羅就來問飛機是不是美國人駕駛的？他們根本就不相信中國人能駕駛飛機。在巴城印尼人問記者：貴國的首都是不是在上海？凡此　　，都足證明我們在東南亞國際宣　　　　　　需要。傳工作的迫切需要。</p>
<h3>主席夫婦捐產　資助敎會興學</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社紐約廿二日電﹞基督敎衛理會今日宣布，蔣主席夫婦己將其重慶之土地房屋捐與敎會，作為學校及難童敎養院之用。此項土地房屋共佔地萬餘畝，並有石造房屋廿幢。主席及共夫人並捐助美金五萬元為其經費。</p>
<h3>張院長飛抵北平　視察東北觀感認官員均知惕勵　留二三日轉赴察綏晋魯</h3>
<p>﹝本報北平廿三日電﹞張院長羣廿三百午十二時由瀋專機飛抵平，隨員鄧友德，周君亮，富伯平等八人同來，故都今日雨過天靑，西苑機塲秋陽朗照，李宗仁，孫運仲，何思源以下官員百餘人俱到塲迎候，機門啓處，張着藏靑色西服，含笑下機，與歡迎高級官員寒暄後，即與李宗仁同車進城，直馳海關招待所休息，昔宋子文北來亦下榻於此。張院長旋即接見記者稱：渠睽違北平已達十四載，彼首次遊平為光緒卅三年晋京考留學時，此後不時來平，最後一次爲民國廿三年，渠進城途經西四牌樓，見沿街所擺盆卉還是十餘年前老樣，故頗有回家之感，此次擬在平住二三天。張恒，歸綏，太原，濟南都想去看看，但路綫日程尙待排定。至華南之行，恐須回京處理積壓要公後始能成行。此行擬到各處君看，硏究政令實施情形如何及考察民間疾苦，難民生活，俾爲救濟工作張本。此外，敵僞在華北遣留之工鑛單位現況如何，亦爲本人所亟欲目睹者，現在平具體之視察節目，正由市府徘定。記者詢以東北觀感，張院長稱：孟子曾言「共操心也危，其慮息也深」，此堪為柬北在位者心情寫照，彼等對東北之重要性，複雜性，嚴重性，俱甚瞭然，而知惕勵。陳主任就職後，各部門正作表率配合，效率即可加強，東北人民擁護中央戡亂，情緒熱烈，渠到長春時、千餘人在街頭歡迎，彼等於敵僞統制十四年後，因切望歸返中央懷抱，一過太平日十也。當張氏昨由長返瀋陽時，天雨昏暗，驚險萬狀，張氏　員今談及猶有餘悸。</p>
<p>﹝中央社北平廿三日電﹞張院長廿三日午後答訪行　李主任，並分論北大校長胡適，平嘗宿傳增湘，谷鐘秀等交換意見，復視察新市區。張院長定廿四日晨出席市府朝會後，視察石景山電廠及製鐵廠。</p>

<h3>瀋陽機廠車輛　政院決予購買　影響江鑛問題解決</h3>
<p>「本報滯陽廿三日電﹞張羣院長巡視東北四日，對於東北一般情勢均加考察，並解決重要問題甚多，張氏勤求民隱，席不暇暖，並不舖張，予東北人民以極佳印象。資委會瀋陽機車車輛廠製造機車五輛，車皮百輛存廠，某部不買，該廠因此項約値六百億法幣之貨物不能脫手，陷入危境。鞍山鋼鐵產品，間接受有影響。另聞開　煤礦存煤五十五萬噸　約値二千　元，無車外運，京滬工業人民均受影嚮，開　礦亦機車車噸，此一僉認怪事之問題得獲解決，直間接影嚮東北及華北工礦業頗人。</p>

<h3>患聾瞽啞瘋人民　可當選民意代表　司法院解釋函復政院</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京廿三日電﹞政院前以瞽目，　啞，聾，瘋，獺之人，執行職務顯有困難，可否當選縣鄉民意機關代表或鄉鎭長，曾函請司法院解釋。頃據司法院函覆，經該院統一解釋法令會議議決：如此項人民當選，在法律上尙不能認其當選無效，縱令任事困難，亦非依法定程序，無從使之去職。</p>
<p>﹝中央社南京廿三日電﹞全國性職業團體之國大代表選舉辦法，頃經廿二日選舉總事務所及全國性職業團體選所聯合舉行之業務會報中，予以修正。其新辦法為，職業國體國大代表候選人，應分區分業簽署，選舉時應分區投票，分區計票，除以各區得票最多者當選為各該區基本數之一名，而婦女代表單獨以全國票數合計外，其餘名額則將全國各區得票次多者，以票數多寰排列名單，加以綜合比較，而決定其當選、</p>
<h3>緩期辦理大選案　參駐會決予保留</h3>
<p>﹝沐報南京廿三日電」一部份參政員主張緩期辦理選舉之意見，廿三日復在參曾駐委啊提出，然仍被決議保留。此項意見，除參政員外，一部份國大代表亦有同感。廿三日駐委會開會時，蔡芷生，余楠秋，盧前提出「請政府緩期辦理各種選舉案」列舉理由六點略為：　戡亂時期不宜分散力量轉移目標。　經濟拮据之際，競選所費，違反節約之旨。　競選醜行無奇不有，廉介之土不屑活動，貪鄙之輩，得以倖進；如此選舉，難收選賢與能之效。　友邦對我援助之程度，全視我軍事，政治力量如何為斷，選舉非彼等注重之點。　各黨派名額比例分配，似須考慮。　目前情勢較去年國大時更為艱困，因時勢環境關係，未嘗不可因時而改變政策。該案提出辦法兩項：　請政府迅速以通訊方式，徵求各國大代表之意見。　請政府迅速召開立法委員會議，硏討緩期辦理選舉問題。討論時各參員發言甚多，張潛華反對最力，謂原案理由之第三至第六四點毫無理由。該案因反對者多，最後仍決議保留。</p>

<h3>中美應眞正互相瞭解　—讀蔣夫人在國際婦恊演詞後的感想—</h3>
<p>國際婦女恊會前日在首都開會，蔣夫人曾出席致詞，建議該會會員由硏究探索中國之文化寶藏而瞭解中國人之思想，並希望她們都能眞正瞭解中國，將來回國以後，都成爲促進國際諒解的重要連鎖，進而建立未來世界之和平。蔣夫人演說原詞甚長，但其最値得友邦人士體味的有兩句話：她說，「中國最近經過了火與血的苦痛洗煉，我們的頭顱雖已血跡淋漓，可是沒有低首」。她又說：「不論我們獲得世界有援助與否，我們準備爭取成功，奮鬥到底」。蔣夫人不但代我們全國人民說了所要說的話，表示了所要表示的態度，而且她很虛心的要求國際間互相諒解之必須更形促進。</p>
<p>我們以爲在今天，中美兩大盟國間的彼此瞭解，尤其有迫切的需要，此不但爲中美計，也爲未來世界之和平計。我們堅決反對彼此不必要的　詞，招致對方不必要的誤會。</p>
<p>如　　　席本月二十六日　見合衆社誯書，「天眞的」談話，與以前　　　特使離華聲明所　「如意算盤」的批評，實在　不妨避免的。　傳孫氏曾向合衆社記者說：「中國政府在　　　　　將軍嚮杜魯門總統　出報吿之結果後，將硏究中國與美國聯合有利，抑與蘇聯聯合有利，若中國被迫傾向蘇聯，則政府與中共勢必能獲得一和平解決」。於是美國人士主認爲「倘中國果有此一意見，則乃係一種「天真」努力」。而正在這個時候，我外交部長在聯合國大會席上的姿態，又似與以往微有不同，且於對日和約，堅持在十一國對日和平初步會議中，應使用大國否決權，在表面上適形成中蘇行動的一致。一般人士乃對於我國當前的外交政策，更紛加揣測，多所誤會，或謂中國將循「以夷制夷」的傳統手腕，以自處於美蘇兩强之間，或謂中國當局之言行，跡近虛聲嚇詐。其實，從中美兩國的友誼歷史來看，若果有所傳的誤會，則不但是兩國的不幸，且更如蔣夫人所說確有加緊促進國際瞭解的必要了。</p>
<p>合衆社所傳關於孫氏的談話，有無錯誤，是否與孫氏的原意相符，我們無從探悉。假使果如合衆社所傳，此項談話也頂多僅足以表示孫氏私人的意向，斷不能据以斷爲政府的決策。據報傳消息：「南京官方人士都認爲孫氏最近的時局談話只是代表他個人的觀念，不足以反映政府的動態」，可知孫氏所言不能代表政府意向，猶之華萊士先生所言未必句句即可代表美國政策。至於我國在對日和約及關於否則權之態度，原係基於我國自己固有的立塲，更不能與孫氏的談話混爲一談。關於對日和約，國民參政會及外交部的對日和約審議委員會都會經過愼重的討慮，均認爲對日和會必須蘇聯參加，和會中四强保留否決權。因爲中國與日本地域接近，遭受日本軍國之侵略，歷時旣久，爲害尤烈，爲了自身的安全，不容日本侵略主義的再燃，故於對日和約，自然特別關心，而中蘇之間，還有許多問題待決，更不能讓蘇聯置身於和約之外。故中國對日和約的決策，在外形上雖或與蘇聯相近似，但是完全基於獨立的立塲，其意義未必同於蘇聯。觀於澳大利亞亦主保留否決權，可知曾受日本侵略或受日本侵略威脅的國家，對此都有同感。</p>
<p>講到我們的對外政策，自有其一貫政策和堅定的立塲。國父臨終的時候，囑付我們：「聯合世界上以平等我之民族，共同奮鬥，」就是說，凡與我友好的各民族，我們都與之爲友。中國二千年來的儒家傳統，祗知道忠信篤敬，親仁善隣，決不容許我們有所謂「嚇詐」「要挾」等不名譽的行爲。至於所謂「以夷制夷」云云，時至今日，也決不會再有這樣過分「天真」的人，未做先說。遭正如拍爾姆斯頓當時所說的「英國沒有永久的朋友，也沒有永久的敵人」一樣，今日如果再來重提，不免也太「天真」了。我們回想孫氏發表談話的時候，正値杜魯門總統特使魏德邁將軍發表他離華聲明以後，而即將提供報吿以前。我們固知魏氏的聲明，或也具有一番好意，只是以特使身分，匆促的時間，訪問旣未必周詳，考査也未盡全確，而於任務方竣，離華返國之際，既有聲明的發表，不特有損中國人民自尊的心理，抑且爲一具有外交官身分的特使不免失禮的行爲，中國人民的憤慨情緖，到處可見。正與孫氏的談話容易招致美國友人的誤會是一樣的。因此，我們想起七月間蔣主席對美記者的談話，就是：中國「歡迎任何建設性之批評」，身爲記者的人，尤應竭力減少民族間的誤會。我們顧中美兩國的人民，對此能夠共勉。</p>
<p>在對外政策方面，中蘇兩國壤地相接，其間國界的綿長世無其四，中蘇兩國立國的主義雖不同，但敦睦隣誼，無疑地應爲我國必然的努力。至於美國與我，隔太平洋相望，自經這次抗日戰爭，中美的傳統友誼又經過瞭一番血與火的洗禮而益趨凝固。我們珍視中美的友誼，我們不欲見中美關係上，乃至中國的對外關係上有什麽誤會。　蔣主席在招待美記者席上說：「中國人民永爲美國之友」！我們對美的友誼始終是堅定的，我們願美國對我們的友誼也始終堅定。</p>

<p>﹝本報訊﹞紐約廿三日廣播：聯合國秘書長賴依，今日向各大國直接呼籲，希望調和東西異見，因此項　見正在全世界各地醞釀恐怖與仇恨故也。賴氏此項呼籲係向聯合國大會發表，其中並未直接提及馬歇爾或維辛斯基，但其呼斗籲之日標，顯係美蘇兩國。賴氏之言有日：「和平所不可或缺之條件，厥為社　制度及和益不同之各國北同努力，尋取和平相處之通，各項困難須山談判之方式解決之，並應有覓致妥協之誠意。不然，國際之和平與安全，即無法予以維持。」賴氏云：大國間雖有異見存在，但尙未至威脅聯合國機構生存之程度，然已足阻撓聯合國之活動，使其無法發揮其應盡之效　。並謂：「余不信此等異見將引起戰爭，蓋世界各國，莫不希望阻止另一次戰爭之發生也。當今最大之困難，莫過於大國間之相互猜疑，恐懼之心理實爲最大危險，蓋恐懼可產生仇恨，仇恨可造成危機，此係必然之趨勢。」賴氏認為聯合國機</p>
<h3>蘇代表對美再施抨擊</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞紐約廿三日廣播：聯合國秘書長賴依發表緊急呼籲之後，蘇聯代表維辛斯基即編起發言，對美國將朝鮮問題提交聯大，攻整不遺餘力，主張將該項問題從議程中取消，其理由為朝鮮問題應由美蘇聯合加以處理，美國此舉，顯屍達背美蘇協定。此外，維辛斯基復對修改對美和約問題列入議程一節，極表不滿，認為此舉不合時宜，缺乏法律根據，蓋該約離批准之時期，為時尙不過一星期也。若干國家顯欲以修改對義和約為手段，以達其自私之目的云。</p>
<h3>歐洲十六國會議結束　英外相大聲疾呼　世界經濟面臨崩潰危機</h3>
<p>﹝路透社巴黎二日電﹞參與馬歇爾計劃之十六國會議批准該會之最後報吿書後，末次大會之主席英外相貝文在會中發表演說，請美國接受歐洲之要求，指出歐洲已嘗支付生命，痛苦，及破壞的最大代價，此非乞求憐憫的呼撇。美國人民及國會今應決定是否應許歐洲協助建立世界之和平及繁榮。歡洲之不幸，將使世界多部份之經濟制度，為之崩潰。貝文繼又請與會國家，勿顧任何離間勢力之影嚮，繼續進行復興計劃。</p>
<p>至多數月內</p>
<p>即臨新局勢貝文稱：在數星期，至多數月以內，吾人即將面臨世界僅有的局勢。貧困，飢饉，及普遍的失業，過去雖亦有之，但均因法律及秩序之破壞，或全世界經濟制度之崩潰所造成；今日歐洲之需要，祗因缺乏對外支付之方法而無法滿足之，此一危機，於充分發展之後，歷史上殊無先例可以判斷其形式為如何。法國代理外長泰　金繼之致辭，對於歐洲國家之木能全部與會，表示遺憾，並申明門戶今仍洞開，未參加之國仍可參加。</p>
<p>義大利飢饉</p>
<p>將造成革命義外長史福薩稱麺義國之：包缺乏現象若再繼續兩三月之久，則革命必將爆發，此非主義的結果，乃飢饉的結果。</p>
<p>﹝路透社巴黎廿三日電﹞參與馬歇爾援歐計劃討論之西歐十六國一致通過之報吿嘗已於曾後在巴黎倫同時發表。</p>
<p>今後四年內</p>
<p>需二百餘億其中估計在今後四年內歐洲需要之援助額爲二百二十四億四千萬美元，除其中盼望能由國際復興銀行供給，以購置主要配備之三十一億一千萬美元外，餘數一百九十三億三千萬美元，需要由美國撥給。此外，偽恢復歐洲若干國內部財政安定狀態，以履行歐洲自助計劃下之生產計劃起見，另行需要三十中億美元之援助此項自助計劃，預定於一九五一年完成，內容包括恢復戰前穀物生產量，增加戰前之食額及　　供應量，提高煤產量至較戰前增加三千萬噸，發電量至較戰前增加三分之二等項。</p>
<h3>國內外局勢日見緊迫　白宮有重要會商　杜魯門定週末宣佈決策</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社華盛頓廿三日電﹞據聞：杜魯門總統廿三日對於國內之高物價及國外飢餓等緊急問題，正考慮提出可能之答案。又聞其最後決定，並將包括是否召集特別議會，對歐洲作彌補短缺及要求美國人民節約究至如何限度等問題在內。</p>
<p>杜魯鬥內閣糧食委會廿三日向總統所提出辦法之要點為：　不採取堅急行動，而祗對美國之榖物出口，嚴格减少，此對减少美國通貨膨脹可有效果，但可能妨害美國之對外政策。　對榖物出口稍形减削，同時並實行全面自動减少口糧計劃，以便有多餘食糧可供出口。據聞總統之多數同級顧問主張採取此一解決辦法，認為此係中庸之道。　努力以求達到可與去年出口相比打破紀錢之五億六千七百萬蒲式耳穀物。此將為非出於自願之節約計劃，須經國會召開特會賦予政府必需權力。最後一項途徑，顯然已不在討論之列。大部份高級官員似已同意，等到有效統制計劃可以實施時，為時已屬太晚矣。甚至馬歇爾聞亦對於召集特別國會失去熱忱。據共和黨某高級國會領袖稱，特別國會如屬召開亦須至十二月，屆時距一月規定之國會會期不過數星期矣。由各種情形觀之，杜魯門顯無意於趕速召開，據聞渠願於聽取各方意見後再作決定。</p>
<p>﹝路透社華盛頓廿二日電﹞影響歐洲今冬命運之美國政策，正由杜魚門總統與其閣僚縝密討論中，今日所舉行之各次會議，計有：　馬歇爾國務卿，商長哈立曼，農長安特遜合組之內閣糧食問題小組會。今日開會兩小時，擬具儘量增加糧食出口，並抑低國內糧價之計劃。　馬歇爾現赴白宮謁統報吿外交動態，特別着重於歐洲之需要。　內閣全體人員舉召於午餐時在白宮會議。　總統偕其特別經濟顧問史蒂爾曼，會後復與內閣糧食小組開會，聆取其報吿。各該會議之結果，將產生美國政府應付國內危機以及歐洲經濟危機之決策。據悉，杜魯門可能即於週末宜布其計劃。</p>
<h3>英美營救無效　貝特柯夫絞決</h3>
<p>﹝路透社索菲亞廿三日電﹞保加利亞反對黨國家農民黨領袖貝特柯夫，已於昨日平夜在保京北郊執行絞決，渠於被判決死刑後提起之上訴，經最高法院認為無理而駁回。按貝特柯夫係於三月前被控陰謀傾覆政府而被捕，旋被判處死刑，英美政府數度向保政府保京盟管會及莫斯科抗議，要求重新審查對貝特柯夫之死刑判決，並抗議審判之方式，悉遭拒絕。</p>
<h3>荷政府宣布　對印尼政策　領事團報吿本周內完成</h3>
<p>﹝路透社海牙廿三日，電」荷總理貝爾今日在下院宣布印尼政策，謂</p>
<p>將即時廢止在吧城之荷闌委員團，另設中央機構以與印尼共和國談判。渠並透荷政府將向國會提出法案，以修正荷蘭憲法，使荷蘭與荷屬東印度得以建立新關係。貝氏表示相信吧城領事團之報吿，必能有利荷蘭。並曰，印尼局勢不能長此繼續，希望安理會能予注意。范莫克總督今夜可自錫蘭返抵吧城，同時吧城之領事團今晨又樂行會議，其調査報吿書可望於週末完成。</p>
<h3>潘迪特夫人廣播　促請注意亞洲人民疾苦</h3>
<p>﹝路透社紐約廿二日電﹞印度駐蘇大使出席聯大首席代表潘迪特夫人，今夜向遠東發表廣播談話，指出世界逐日注意歐洲之飢荒威脅，但對亞洲數萬萬人民之痛苦，則比較的不甚予以注意。夫人稱，印度之企求自由和平及公理，熱忱在世界任何國家之上，吾人當盡力加强聯合國機構，印度人民感覺印度之分裂為一悲痛的打擊，吾人希望經由吾人在聯合國機構內外的工作。印度及巴基斯俎得以在短期內認識土地之分裂，不需亦不應即為兩國人民「利益的分裂。夫人繼云，為維持世界和平計，吾人深盼荷蘭得以認識英國之如何根據聯合國憲章放棄其統治他國之權力。夫人繼又譴責目前之戰爭宣傳，指為危險的宣傳，久之足以引起戰爭。</p>
<h3>日財閥集團力謀抵制。　。經濟力集中排除法案　要求實行「自主的」金融統制</h3>
<p>﹝新亞社東京廿三日電﹞日本社會黨黨魁片山哲所領導之聯合內閣，因煤淡國營問題未得完全推行社會黨之政策，故擬在經濟力集中排除法案中，表現若干經濟民主化之形式，但比頃法案內容發表後，立即引起日財閥勢力之强烈反對。</p>
<p>日前由日本四大財閥之一住友銀行副社長堀田莊三氏所領導之經濟同友會，發表所謂「金融統制民主化方案」，以謀抵制，該方案之耍點如下：　設立以民營金融機關、日本銀行，及存款人代表人所組成之金融委員會，實行首主的非官僚主義的金融統制。　各金融機關以每一股東不得持有總資金二十分之一以上之股權為原則。　改組特殊金融機關，實行金融行政一元化，並開放地方金融，允許設立地方銀行。</p>

<h3>蘇附庸國發言　竟牽涉我國</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社弗魯辛草地廿二日電﹞　英代表麥克尼爾發表演說後，南斯拉夫外長薛米克今日在聯合國大會中，重申蘇聯指斥西方國家之各點稱，「根據美國官方資料，美國在戰爭停止後之首先三個月中，運往中國之戰爭物資數量，較第二次世界大戰期中運往中國之物資總數尤多。馬歇爾計劃欲使歐洲在「金錢幕」後陷於孤立，接受此項大量援助國家之遭遇如何？中國如何？」烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基亦對美國援助中國加以指責稱，「美國此一行動，乃　反聯合憲章之禁例，不得干涉他國內政，無恥之戰爭販子繼續支持中國，巴勒斯坦及希臘之反動集團」。</p>
<h3>改造西伯利亞　成為蘇聯心臟　史達林理想可實現</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社紐約廿三日電﹞前陸軍部蘇聯經濟司長雷蒙特，今日在「聯合國世界」雜誌撰丈，報吿史達林改造西伯利亞爲蘇聯心臟之夢想即將實現。據雜蘇聯已依照目前五年計劃，秘密律設工業新城市一百處，力謀將一片荒野，變成生產要樞，足徵蘇聯對於因戰爭摧毀之工業經濟，正在邁步復興。此等城市雖在本國知者絕鮮，最新地圖亦未收入，僅少數已予命名，其餘暫時總稱為「貝辛楊卡」即「無名城」之意，有待利用史達林與莫洛托夫姓名加以變化，再定稱呼。建設各城市之目的，不在宣傅或吸引遊客，而在容納大工廠，水電廠，礦場與鐵路連絡站，並供給來自各地之數十萬工人居住。</p>

<h3>參議會大會第二日　對市政設施紛紛提質詢　關於警政社會部份最多</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞市參議會第四次大曾，昨日下午三時至七時，舉行第二次會議，由參議員對本市民政。警政。社會。財政及衛生方面提出質詢，然後由吳市長及張處長曉崧，俞局長叔平，田局長永謙及吳局長開先相繼分別一一答復；業衛生問題則按議程定今日下午答覆，同時並將對公用。工務。地政。衛生，敎育施政提出質詢，而再由各有關局長答覆。茲將昨”參議員質詢及局長答覆分別記述如下。</p>
<p>（一）社會方面：張中原質詢：　汽事市政建設捐中規定，以三十六億作救濟事業費，而當參觀兒童敎養所時，為何據稱祗收到食米，（可吃到明年新年）而無一錢拿到？　麥特赫斯脫路兒童敎養所有兒黨二百名已搬到漕河涇，兒童敎養所，原處改為婦女敎養所，但原可住二百人之地方，何以現在祗收二十多個婦女？　社會局以後對街頭流浪兒童，能否繼續收容？陸惠明問婦女敎養所組織情形，並盼能多多收容妓女等，使學習手藝俾謀正當職業。</p>
<h3>帶了盒子砲搶人　敎養所管理困難　。吳局長無法應付表示慚愧。</h3>
<p>吳市長首先答覆，兒童敎養所改婦女敎養所後所以不能多容人，乃因經費與食糧缺乏之故。吳局長之答覆稱：汽軍建設捐巾半年度作救濟費者，預算收入應為十七億九千七百卅二萬元，但社局本身至今尙未取到。前曾以二分錢利息向市銀行先借十億元，已全部購米，故兒童敎養所祗收到米而無錢係事實。過去收容所伙食費經中央規定每人每月一萬六千元，後經呈請後，中央已准自九月份起增加至二萬五千元。關於婦女敎養所之管理實非常困難，如收容一妓女，三五天後，即有人來把她搶去，有一妓女來所後，忽來一男干說是她丈夫，靠她養的，妓女進所，他即無飯可吃。又有一老太婆來說，媳婦進所後，她和她孫子都無以為生，硬要她回去。他們起初用軟辦法，後來帶了盒子砲來，最後又領了便衣或武裝人來把她搶去。如此情形而搶走者竟達十幾個之多。上海如此怪現象，風氣又惡劣至此，本人無法應付，實覺慚愧，現已與警局各分局聯繫，隨時請派武裝警士來保護。但救濟事業之擴充亦急不待緩，照本人意思，最好把老太婆。孩子。丈夫全都送到收容所去。建設捐中多餘款項，即擬充擴展救濟事業經費。又馬路上流浪兒童，決繼續收容，不使收容所有空額。</p>
<h3>山東同鄕會　糾紛眞相</h3>
<p>費樹聲請公布山東旅滬同鄉會糾紛事件眞相。吳局長答：此問題很複雜。西門路山束會館在民十幾年成立，敵偽時期，由蘇成德做曾長而改為同鄉會，此實不合理，因山東曾館乃一財團，而同鄉會係一社團。後該會改辦武訓學校，乃由民主同盟所辦，既未立案，且時常發生搗亂事情，經調査後，發現此校由山東同鄉會蘇成德舊屬所主持者。政府為維持社會安寗起見，曾令該校停辦，但該校主持人章乃器等不允，故不得不下令飭該會館停止活動，　辦學校。後經各方調解，乃在該會館舊有主持人十一人外加派四靑年山東人共同組識一同鄉會，但遭舊有委員反對，接着並有馬登　者刋登廣吿，並聞耗廣吿費五千萬元。本人站在社會團體監督地位，有權處理；且兩方面各自發起組織同一性質之社團，實非所宜，故令合併辦理。</p>
<p>社團必有正當任務</p>
<p>費樹　又問：市民組織社團向社局登記，何以有的批准，有的不批准？局長答：目前時有一般集團來申請核准，但調査後，發現頗有藉名向會員收巨額會費，或包辦打架，故未准。法定團體，其宗旨應純粹，且至少應有一特殊正當任務，如專以聯絡感情等，實屬不必要。</p>
<p>周廉澤謂；公典當額定三萬元實在太少，應增加至二十萬或三十萬。答：公典之設立，乃爲救濟平民，來常者任何破壞衣物均接收，而十個當有九個不贖，故經費有限，且增加太高，眞正窮人亦無法典質。</p>
<h3>禁無善後　很傷腦筋</h3>
<p>又陸惠明詢對一抽籤禁舞後失業舞女之善後問題如何解決，張志韓亦謂：政府對於節約方案應愼重考慮，否則會引起社會騷動。政府把舞女當作洪水猛獸，似不合理，誰無兒女，沒有人生了女兒就準備等她長大後做舞女，所以如此，乃非得已也。</p>
<p>吳局長對此問題之答覆說：參議員提案中謂「禁舞不如肅舞」。本人認為若要把跳舞塲嚴肅起來，實在是件不容易的事。但失業後舞女救濟問題，又是很傷腦筋。上次市政會議時，吳市長即問我有什麼辦法，我即同答他「沒有辦法」，祗有「嫁人」。說句不客氣的話，舞女的生活太糜　，平時吃穿慣了，救濟所養不起她們，她們也住不來，所以還是好好嫁人，安安逸逸過日子。</p>
<h3>關於金都大慘案　局長曾自請處分</h3>
<p>（二）警政方面：張志韓請　報吿金都慘案處理結果。　本市交通紊亂，每易發生慘案，而一般空三輸車及黃包車時在路上傷哉游哉，妨碍交通至大，務須嚴格取締。俞局長答：　金都事件關於憲兵部分己在南京審判終結，至警察部分，關於刑事者，將由司法機關審判，關於行政者，新成分局局長已予降調。老閘，黃浦及嵩山當時亦有學警參加，故予各該局長記大過一次。至本人亦有失職之處，曾自請市長處分。　空車遊蕩路上，隨時督飭注意，惟有一部份係郊區來者，回去時無客人可招，不免阻碍交通，決予嚴格取締。</p>
<p>張中原謂：黃包車及三輸車車塾時被警察取去，一日不還，即影響一日生計，精採取罰款辦法。局長答：車墊被取去，本人亦很同情，曾三令五申，飭屬勿去，但據員警報吿，彼等屢次達規，戒而不聽，實益其他辦法。</p>
<h3>楊安仁　憔悴　入監所僅旬日　無復舊日英姿</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞金潮案主角已判七年徒刑之國行業務局副局長楊安仁，昨日下午四時由思南路看守所中提出，楊精神類唐，面色蒼白，兩目無神，着舊白帆布西裝，藍色翻領領襯衫，舊黃皮鞋。入監所僅十餘日，已無復昔日英挺姿態。先押至大法庭候審，繼押至第八偵査庭由傳邦檢察官訊問在審訊期間有無羈押情形，以便在刑期中扣除。楊答於案發時曾被警備司令部扣押一天，是以該案執行時，楊之刑期為七年少一天。至四時卅分，訊畢，仍還押看守所。聞楊於日內即移解提籃橋上海監獄執行。</p>
<h3>舞女大聲疾呼　我不要嫁人　又開大會呼籲　緩期禁絕無塲</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞禁舞聲中，本市舞廳業為作再度呼籲，昨晨十時在新仙林舞廳又召開第二次臨時大會。本市廿九家舞應代表，舞女，樂師，舞業職工，約計二萬餘人，均乘大卡車於侵晨即紛紛到達。新仙林內外於是重呈前次萬頭攢動之盛况。近四千餘之舞女仍一律布履籃衫，蓬頭垢面，俯仰偃臥於新仙林前之草坪上，宛如難民一羣。彼等與新仙林屋項巨大之無光霓虹相對，使人殊有繁華如夢之感。</p>
<p>開會後首由大會主席團孫洪元，鄭煒顯，唐宗傑，毛志海等光後致詞，翻覆陳述舞塲為正當營業，與節約無關，如節約足以製造失業，則數萬舞業職工之父母子女，生計亦將斷絕，故呼籲當局果欲限期抽籤禁舞，亦應給予三年至五年之充分時問，俾能設法從容轉業。嗣由舞女代表孫致　及金美紅二人演說，孫大呼：「我們要求有繼續活下去的權利！」金則頻呼：「我不要嫁人！」均激昂異當，盡改上次涕淚縱橫之姿態。昨會塲中為維持秩序，事前將男女席次左右分開，女席上頗多老婦幼童，均係舞女摯來之家屬，當金孫慷慨陳辭時，彼輩諦聽，似感動甚深，亦有悄悄以手帕拭淚者。</p>
<h3>參議員絕妙演辭　跳舞可以醫凍瘃</h3>
<p>舞棠職工會代表胡運源　登台稱；「如果我們的要求不能實現，我們到中山陵前哭訴去！」言未畢一片掌　諸隨之而起。樂師代表阿拉納斯繼又以輕鬆之語調謂：「多少外國人士都趕到上海來觀光舞塲，因為上海舞　有一種特殊的情調，如果把這種情調加以消滅，那是大煞風景了！」馬內又報以一片掌聲。至參議員朱文德演說至「跳舞可以醫凍煉，音樂可以解煩悶，為什麽要禁掉它」時，內外鼓掌呌好，歷久不息。</p>
<p>推派十代表附參會請願　　大會庭決議推代表孫洪元。孫遂人。金美紅。孫致敏。徐天冰。陳耀庭。何海。鄭中元。唐宗傑。阿拉納司十人於下午三時赴參議會請願，由參議員王先靑。陶百川代表接見。孫致敏當塲呈出全市舞女上蔣夫人兩件八百十八封，並由孫洪元與阿拉納司于陳述意見，王陶允代為轉達，並殷囑各代表善體「安定第一」之旨，靜候當局指示辦法，當局決可儘量顧及滬市特殊環境，而定一圓滿解決方法。各代表獲得確實答復後即相率辭去。</p>
<h3>迅雷不及掩耳　分頭搜索囤虎　查獲集團囤積油料　總數千噸價値百億　簽請另組審查會進行核辦</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞本中汽油機油燃料油價格暴漲，幕後實有人集團操縱囤積所致，吳市長接獲此項報吿後，即派員密査，並將該批囤積油商名單一紙於昨晨送交警局經濟科，經徐科長請示阮處長後立即出動大批幹員。分成十四小組，同時出發檢査，迄至午後六時，檢查獲各種油類總數達千餘噸，價値約百億元之鉅，　高陽路永大火油廠囤柴油一千稱，火油五五○聽，又扁桶三七補，　鄱陽路三六一號王從銓囤薄質柴油十六桶，中質柴油二，二二二桶，厚柴汕一，一四九桶。</p>

<p>市長亦答：本市交通紊亂，要道馬路太窄，影響至鉅，天目路拓寬後，當極有利，然居民又來會請願，但市府為大多數人之利益，實不得不犧牲少數人之利益。</p>
<h3>小茶館狂賭新年到現在</h3>

<h3>秋老　葫蘆島</h3>
<p>﹝本報瀋陽十八日航訊﹞葫蘆島的秋大，顯得特別凄涼寂寞，這是記者所得到的第一個印象。港口望外，烟波無垠，沒有一柱烟囱，也沒有一葉帆影，只有水烏在那裏戲　。三個碼頭上都靜悄悄地，有一隻六千噸的貨輪停泊，已經卸完彈藥和槍枝，滿裝三個列車，有三五士兵在碼頭上閒蕩。一個士兵很吃力的釣到一條小魚。這兒禁止商船入口，它吞吐的祇是戰爭的物資，沒有銅臭的味道，也沒有大腹賈和普通遊客的足跡。從港口司令部貼的佈吿看，曾有走私和黑市活動。歷史注定了葫蘆島的孤獨，民國十九年四月，我政府興工建築之時，日人就千方百計，加以阻撓，九一八事變後，日人發展旅大及大東港，使葫蘆島像幽靈似的守望在遼東灣西岸。歷史已前進了一步，今天我們要重新估定葫蘆島的價値，重視束北，就不能不重視目前這唯一的門戶了。</p>
<p>島上有不高的小山，突出海面，在山的右而、有一個漁港，出產大量的毛蝦。記者翻過山背，一幅「漁光曲」的書面展開在眼前。下坡到漁民村，這村子有一百八十戶，約一千二百餘人，全靠毛蝦生活，每年總收入達二千四百億元（流通券），收入的百分之六十在少數船主手中，漁民辛辛苦苦，不得溫飽。一隻漁船上僱用四個漁夫，捕十斤魚，船主得六斤，每個漁夫祇能得到一斤魚。一個漁夫一年最高的收入六十萬元，最低二十萬元，實際上不够吃高梁米和玉蜀黍。從他們的臉上看不見水手的顏色，他們已為飢餓所侵蝕。在這海島的一角，犬多數善良的老百姓正過着屈辱窮困的生活，社會的不安定，原因也許就在這裏。</p>
<p>離開這小島的時候，我遙望港口；海風呼嘯，浪頭鑽動，正是秋潮湧來的景象！（記者趙展）葫蘆島港第二碼頭ㄦ（東北社攝）</p>

<h3>麗池的夜色　香島游泳池開幕記盛</h3>
<p>﹝本報香港通訊﹞秋凉了，麗池在這個時候才開幕，確實跟季候有點脫節，但在游泳塲缺乏的今天，加以它在改裝以後，出現的姿態，已經是「麗池花園」了，我想，吸引人的地方還是不少的。</p>
<p>「麗池」去年給空軍徵用去了，直到最近　交還出來，在一番佈置下，別有風趣。它的泳池設備，跟上海的「大陸」差不了許多，可是跳台的完善，「大陸」却遜一籌，何况「麗池」背面臨海，帶有些微天然奇趣意味，沒有「俗氣」。令人興奮的，還有露天舞池。</p>
<p>綠草上，拚排桌椅，有醉人的音樂，有醇香的酒，也可以進一杯深味的咖啡，海風拂揚，惑人的燈光，迷人的月色，是一個好去處！中秋節夜，只要沒有雨，這裏是不愁賓客的。</p>
<p>為了天雨的關係，「麗池」延至七日才「剪綵」開幕。五時過後，東行的「箐箕灣」電車，擠迫得很，到「麗池」趁熱鬧的人眞不少。郭泉，翁世見，曹克安，商界聞人也臨「池」捧塲，是難得的盛况。綠茵草上的桌椅，怎能容得上五千多觀衆。</p>
<p>六時是游泳表演開始，精彩節目有：螺絲轉泳，雙人泳，開倒車泳，麻包脫泳……還有跳水，水球表演，參加演出的是：陳律己，麥偉明，王秀山，羅德貞等游泳名手。八時的秩序，是舞池剪綵，執行典禮的是四姊妹：襲秋霞，陳琦，張帆，陳娟娟。我們在海濱秋凉夜冷中賦蹄去。</p>
<h3>助學擊彈賽　大東盃讓分比賽　參加者四十餘人</h3>

<h3>四聯總處巡迴稽核團　上海區工作吿竣</h3>
<p>對於十大工業已提出總報吿</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕四聯總處此次上海區巡廻稽核工作，為時二月有餘，已於本月廿日全部結束，先後抽査工廠一〇二家，包括染織，麵粉，榨汕，電機，化工等各類生產事業。本市規模較大之貸款工廠，大致均已査到。此次稽核工作，不布枝節之推敲，主要在尋求事實，以明瞭各生產事業之實際情况，在貸款後之成效。故工作實較歷次為繁重。除就抽査各廠，編製結核報吿外，並向有關機關，　集資料，以期　可印證。對於錦織，絲織，毛織，麵粉，榨汕，電氣，機　，搪瓷，橡膠，西藥等十大生要工業，亦已提出總報吿，用為提供當局決定今後審査放款及推行定貨貸款政策之參考。根據査核之結果，情形大致如次：　一般對貸款之運用，尙屬正常，尙未發現有用於非生貨途徑之情事。因原料不斷上漲，多感資金轉輾困難，將貨款用於購料，實較其他用途遠勝一籌。　大多廠商，貸款後產銷量，確有顯著之增加。惟亦右因原料之缺乏，動力之不足，勞資之糾紛，可能生產量，尙未達到最高之限度。　各廠曾計制度，大多尙欠健全。其中仍狃於積習，襲用舊式記帳科目，混淆不淸，實應改善。</p>
<h3>棉紗布創新高價　四二支藍鳳二千四百五十萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以靑島漢口等地紗價高昂，津粵等帮採辦特暢，又加業外拉提，行情一致再創新高峯四二支監鳳紗比上日賡續狂漲二百萬，為二千四百五十萬元。廿支特雙馬及輕雙馬亦均步勝七八十萬元，其他各支粗細紗亦升五六十萬至七八十萬元不等。</p>
<p>昨棉市以實銷開展，漢口帮對色布辦胃甚健，北帮及粵帮亦有零星去化，致各布行情均創新高價。結果龍頭細布昂至六十萬零八千元，比上日步漲三萬三千，五福彩球陽鶴等細布，因走銷奇暢，挺升三五萬元。其他漂布粗布嗶嘰直貢色布士林布等，一致再漲三四萬至六七萬元之鉅。</p>

<h3>人絲堅定廠經劇漲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市仍堅，一二〇號金三馬有光上午開盤四千五百萬元，隔日期成交一箱，後即低回，最小即期做四百萬元，迄中午又高至四百五十萬元收盤。下午最後價為四百八十萬元，東年五百四十萬元成交，比上日大八十萬元、</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>漲勢仍烈，昨日下午C字等級成交價四千六百萬元，D級五百五十萬元，不過貨款均有七天期頭，比上日喊價高二百萬元，高另担四千四百萬有做開，中另担三百萬元，亦有交易。干經高另担做開三千二百萬元，二八分單子貨喊價三百萬元，較上日大一百五十萬元之譜。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>繼續高昂，大誠及華强眞絲被面，開巿在一千七百萬元左右，吸胃甚旺，扶搖直上。迄收市高至七百六十萬元即期價，隔日期做七十五萬元，比上日又漲起一百五十萬元。美亞被面喊八百五十萬元，格子璧縐喊六萬四五千元，惟乏成交。華錦縐四萬元，震旦燈芯十二萬五千元，其餘各貨，去胃均好，故莫不提升。</p>
<h3>統債沉寂　外股平定</h3>
<p>公債昨平庸寥寂，成交極少，不過三百萬。各債起仆互見，二三〇室買進，五〇三室三六〇室則出。統丙晟開一二二〇〇元，高價一二七〇〇元，回低至一一九〇〇元，而後稍盤。統果較前收計甲乙低一〇〇元，丙戊小升二〇〇元，統丁平平。</p>
<p>外股昨各股互有出入，前日激漲者回低，而小型股軋高，港申電曾迫低至十元大關，證券帮錢兌帮來進，銀行帮及成帮則出。怡紗晟開一〇四五〇〇元，低價一〇二〇〇〇元，而後平定。結果較前收計會德豐紙業怡　小升，集廣航業鋼榮各漲牛成，怡紗英聯微挫。</p>
<h3>食米止跌轉漲　麵粉交易活絡</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬三中餘石，連日猛跌之後，店方乘巧納取，兼之內地轉昂，市况疲而轉挺。粳　元米一致回漲萬元，麵粉配價不動，市銷交易熱絡，挺升千餘元。麩皮浙閩均有進胃，求過於供，飛騰三四千元。豆胼汕頭有動，盤漲一二千元。黃豆油廠進媽，轉漲三五千元。菉豆南北洋暢納，呂宋靑島互相爭購，到不敵銷，續漲萬元。蠶豆到銷兩平，價無變化。元麥酒坊貪搶，猛加萬元。小麥穩固之局，紅糧仍趨堅挺。苞米靑島成交見减，回低三五千元。生仁廣帮重見收吸，轉漲一二萬元。芝蔴依然少神，暫難生色，巾次步削萬元。</p>
<p>油巿甬帮略有問津，中秋飾關將屆，店方實銷轉殷，納胃加强，生豆油圓高一二萬元，淸油亦加二萬元，菜油亦升一二萬元，蔴油加一二萬元。</p>
<h3>多頭逢高力售　華股趨勢盤旋</h3>
<p>華股昨多盤頭，紗花帮及香港方面買戶接踵而來，前後市均曾再見高檔，終以獲利之多頭，源源傾出，　塲外消化不良，息價開高至二角四分，以致欲漲屢阻，徘徊不己，前途當視銀根而定。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>承前收餘勢，各股均高，開後遞永紗自二五三元起，賣到二四八元。經力購乃漲到二五五元及二五七元高價，旋因紛粉脫手者多，回跌至即交二四三元，遞交二四四元低價。後又屢次迫近二五〇元光景。此時因隔夜浮多獲利了結之外，又有脫手，頗　掙扎。十時半塲外息價亦開高至一角九分半及二角四，在二四五元光景盤旋。十時五十分後，業中大戶　某等力拉，買風再起，再將遞永紗拉上至二五六元，某項黑市價回小一成，近午再低至二四七元但臨收時仍易拉上，午收為即交二四七元，遞交二五〇元，收後喊價微昂。結果與前收計即交勤興漲一成，永紗信和美亞新光景福勤興永業中絲景綸微升，中法跌一成，新華華豐平平，國貨漲停，餘者升降俱微。遞交股計信和美亞小升，勤興升半成，永紗華豐景福微挫。</p>
<p>後市</p>
<p>開出即秀，開後塲外喊價　超越塲內之遞交甚多，到戶興奮，永紗漲到二五六元及二五八八元高價，旋以脫手者衆，低至二四九元及二五〇元，國行差出二二五億，買風再起，曾再回好至二五七元，散多了結，臨收又低至二五〇元及二五一元，收後塲外喊價見低，結果較前市收盤，即交股計永紗華豐景福中紡水泥閘北恒豐微升，勤興巾法景綸漲半成，美亞信和新華尙平，國貨仍站漲停，餘告小挫。遞交股計信和美亞新光微降，永紗華豐景福微升，塲外各老股見穩。</p>
<h3>全國紡織工業生產會議　明日上午在滬開幕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部主持之全國紡織工業生產會議，定明日上午九時起假市商會舉行，會期三日，陳啓天將來滬親自主持。大會已成立秘書處，由劉文騰担任秘書長，袁伸達副之。出席代表預計國民營廠代表專家在二百五十人以上，將來大會之提案，將分成五組審査，即：　原料組，　工業按術組，　資金組，　紡織敎育組，　紗布調節運銷及其他。今日正午十二時開第四次籌備委員會，午後三時招待記者，目前己報到人數逾五十人，收到提案四十餘件，多數均有關生產技術改善問題。</p>
<h3>民用煤分配辦法　燃管會明日開會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會第六次民用煤分配委員會，已定於　五日下午二時舉行。屆時對本市第四次民用煤，將決定分配辦法。聞第四次配煤總額，仍定為一萬五千噸。至第三次民用配煤，一萬三千餘噸，業已配出者達十之八九。分配會調査小組會，並已於廿日舉行會議，對原定四十四業配煤之甲乙丙丁戊等級，另加調整云。</p>
<p>又最近黑市煤價波動，烟煤每噸已出三百萬元關，與官價相差在三倍以上。據分析原因：　一般物價騰漲。　柴油業已漲價三倍，改用煤斤者日多。　漢口地方不靖，湘煤來源受阻。故煤價遂逐步看漲。惟燃管會煤斤來源，日見增加，但為充實安全煤存底計，故對配量，尙未能充分增加。然深信如配煤不脫期，煤價可逐步納入正軌。據悉：最近開　華　各煤礦，紛紛來函要求調整礦煤價格。蓋：　自外匯率改按市掛脾後，成本澈增。　工資普增。以目前之煤價，實無法繼續生產該會刻正據情考慮中云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕煤球市價已漲至每担八萬五千元，而產業工人配售價格仍為每担二萬八千元，相差甚鉅，因此各工廠向社會局申請配售者甚為踴躍。社會局為恐發生流弊流入黑巿，特於昨日邀集中央銀行，中央信託局，燃料管理委員會及機製煤球業公會會商，決定對核准配售之各煤球廠仍儘量發貨，如一旦發現有將配售煤球流入黑市情形，則立即停止各該工廠之配售權利。與會者又計算年內全國煤屑來源，依上海燃料消費情形，年內尙差二百噸煤屑。需動用外匯向國外採購來滬，此項外匯請中信同及中央銀行設法。</p>

<h3>外匯平衡收效　僑匯漸入佳境</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據外匯平衡基金委會某負責人語記者：該會平衡外匯之最大目標，係使匯率更切近實際，辦以促進輸出，增收僑匯。渠稱：自該會成立，迄本月十八日一月間，一般物價上漲百分之四十，出口物資價格上漲約百分之九，外匯匯率上漲約百分之九。由此比較，一般物價之影嚮於出口貨及外匯率，已彰彰明甚。惟平衡委會，仍望在顧全實際情形之前提下，儘量求匯率之平衡。據吿：一月來我國轍出情形，確較預期者為佳，僑匯亦漸趨正常。今後更將藉平衡匯率之方策，使輸出僑匯，日趨佳境云</p>
<h3>香烟肥皂均漲</h3>
<p>香烟市面雖有華成及南洋派貨，因買勢旺盛，行情終見上揚。十支大英牌比上日步漲卅萬元，老刀牌亦好卅五萬，其他中外各牌條烟亦均一致步升。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂交易甚旺，人心一致看高。固本箭刀兩牌昨同漲一萬四五千元，祥茂光華等牌價亦盤升一萬餘元。</p>

<h3>張書旂畫展</h3>
<p>— 蠡甫</p>
<p>書旅兄由美載譽歸來，陳其近作於中國畫苑，乃藝壇盛事。余觀其巨幅，運筆酣暢，墨色交融，神完氣。鈎斫尤猷勁，直逼宋人，一掃晚近途描疲軟之習。間有利用染色紙地，益覺淸麗；愈深得烘托之妙。山水則係前所未見，內中秋樹一幅、搖颺多姿，而氣象森　，大有屈子「風颯颯兮木簫蕭」之概，為全塲之冠。柳數幅，疎落有致，點綴坡脚水口，尤覺悠然意遠。着色者過半，率多不拘陳法，匠心獨運。良以美國近十年來，肆意收購歐洲古今名繪，儲藏之富，幾不亞法·意·比·英諸國。書旂兄居彼既久，朝夕觀摩，別有會心。遂弗覺流露於紙上也。</p>
<h3>朱應鵬的世術觀</h3>
<p>— 吳提</p>
<p>對于一切造型藝術的欣賞，通常總是經歷由「目賞」到「心賞」這一個過程前者是生理的，而後者是心理的思想的。</p>
<p>這次朱北海（應鵬）先生的國畫展覽之前，我曾拜讀一過。舉出那張現將軍身的觀世音來說吧，一眼望過去，最觸目的是那細而尖，速度甚緩，沈着而明晰的綫；其次是錢的方向與起伏，自由變化，自由發生，雖極嚴整而又極其暢達的快感；又其次是滋潤透明，輕勻熨貼的色調，彷彿早春之空氣，沁人心脾。這樣，從畫面喚起我的生理的運動達到一個適當的階段後，理智觀念才使我注意到描繪的主題。慈悲的女性的觀世音菩薩，一變而成為威武的將軍，正是「我于彼前，皆現其身，而現其身，而為說法，令其成就」源出於佛經的故事。看表情，佛菩薩的偶像之姿容，根本不存，而一種超人的靈肉一致之神情，則溢於楮墨。其為界，則是諸天境界。他的人物畫法，在中國固有的格調之中，包含了希臘，印度，以及歐洲文藝復興以後各種藝術的質素。氣韵生動，絢爛壯麗。於蘊藉之中見熱烈，充滿了生命之力。從書面上引起我的領會，覺得朱氐的藝術內容，有兩點主要因素：在思想上是出世與現世兩種潮流的會合；在藝術上是民族性與世界性兩種力量的融和。</p>
<p>像朱氐這種形神獨殊，瑰麗奇偉的畫風，說他故意矯揉造作，當然是不對的。事實上，其來無自的東西，也絕不可能引起欣賞者新的感動和戰慄。舉凡藝術品風格之形成莫不決定于藝術家的人格，而藝術家的人格又莫不決定於他的思想他的哲學根據。朱氏的作品陳列在中國藝苑，大家都可以欣賞，緣此。我個人憑主觀的推論，不必再是形而下的這一面，而是形而上的那一面。</p>
<p>這次展出的畫件都是朱氏近時的製作，雖非定本，却已經是成熟的碩果，自不待言。二十多年來，他從黨政生活到社會生活，到敵偽佔領上海後以迄於今日，寂寞的　居生活，從外表看，，但是，他的藝術史　和民族主義思想，滙合而成為一股精神的。由于多年來寄情於史詩，轉而研究希臘藝術由西東漸的過程，更涉及代表民族的意識形態的宗敎神話，因此，在這次國畫展中我們感到一股新生的力，隱然有騷動中國文世復興之勢。</p>
<p>就畫論畫，近代「以臨摹為創作」的畫風，也到了非變不可的時候了。士大夫個人寫意之作，已經空泛而無內容了。代之而起的，應該是浪漫精神寫實主義的民族畫家。就像朱氏，在他展覽陳列中的少數山水畫，也無不具有濃厚的史詩氣氛。一個理想的自然境地，和南宋以來作為逃遁現實悠然自適的小夭地是不同的。</p>
<h3>應鵬之畫</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>書畫家第一個條件，是要有自已本來面目的個性。既然自已，有了顯明的個性，自然而然會走到創作的路上去了。如顏魯公的書法，便是有其個性，而創造了「顏字」，成為書法的一大宗派。畫家則如王維，梁楷，米芾，八大，四王，金冬心，焦秉貞等，都是個性最强而能創作的大匠。</p>
<h3>白梅</h3>

<h3>送顧一樵先生序</h3>
<p>— 張增泰</p>
<p>丁亥九月一日，上海市立小學校校長談話會同人，公餞上海市敎育局局長顧一樵先生於中央西菜社。因先生辭去上海市敎育局局長，榮任國立政治大學校長：其於政治大學，有獲得賢校長之慶；而二年以來先生復興上海敎育之成績，及上海敎育五年計劃之未盡實施，凡我同人供不欲先生一日離上海而去也。</p>
<p>蓋上海為我中華民國文化之中心，而大中小學之多，復為全國第一。不幸民國廿六年八月十三日，倭兵來犯，所有舉校與文化機關被敵寇摧殘者，殆十之八九。勝利之後，先生首任上海市敎育局局長，於經濟萬分困難之中，不辭勞悴，奔走呼報，以謀復興。未及二年，原有之市校，幾盡恢復；而新設之市校，較前增加半數以上，學生數亦幾增一倍以上。其辦理民衆敎育，掃除文盲，更不遺餘力。此先生二年以來復興上海敎育之成績，昭昭在人耳目，乃永久不可泯滅者也。且邇來物價日高，生計日窘，先生於提高敎師底薪之外，更向市府請求發給敎師學術進修費，共於敎師之生活，不無補益。此先生有助於我市校敎師，亦使我同人永久不忘者也。今當臨行之際，回憶先生復興上海敎育之成績，體念市校敎師之生活，能不悠然以思，黯然以傷！然先生榮任國立政治大學，將來事業之成就，名望之崇隆，當十倍百倍於上海之今日，益令人景仰無已也！</p>
<p>予與先生非公事未嘗一日相接，茲乃祖道江千，謹言之如右。</p>
<h3>喜見觀音變相</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>時交白露，下了幾陣雨，炎熱頓時消去。趁着凉爽的天氣，到友人朱北海（應鵬）家中去讀書，該是一件有興味的事情。</p>
<p>是一問精緻的客廳，最惹我注意的是「碧紗籠」，我的意思是說那三個單有紗傑的書架，像大衣橱的裝直似的，上下端裝上銅桿，旣可以避免日曬風吹，灰塵滿積，又感覺到非常整潔。畫架上是荷馬和希臘神話中人物的石膏像。對面掛着一幅北海自繪的油畫，旁邊一架銅琴，上面疊着許多樂譜，還有一座悲多汶的造象。這大約是他的小姐明五的「愛好」。套間的壁上懸着他的弟子蘇憲的大幅油畫，阿坡羅駕雲車。單只看這充滿藝術氣氛的客廳，主人是怎樣的一個人，也就不必介紹了。</p>
<p>我吵醒了北海的午睡。他拿川他許多的近作給我看。不久，賀天健，俞劍華，王進珊諸賽友也來了，還到了陳實驊，沈立之，　希宗二位。我們一同鑑賞着北海的覺，一面隨意　談着最近十餘年來畫壇的變遷大勢。</p>
<p>北海的畫約分山水與人物兩類。像「雲棧圖」，「三松圖」，「崇巒秋爽」和想像中的「華山」那樣的陸地景象，雖也是一雲倚傍的創作，　覺得新鮮的氣息不多，引不起特殊的感覺。也許是我少見多怪吧？凡寫海或雪海的，總使我這樣想，以前不曾見過類似這樣的畫。如「破浪」，「天　日馭」，「落日驚濤」，「觀海圖」，「海　　」，設色既淡，且極幽靜，脫去烟火氣，達到爐火純靑的地步。他取材於「山海經」，更投合了我這神話愛好者的口胃。說一句不倫不類的話，我彷彿在　元曲選中所插的版畫。</p>
<p>人物比山水更好。諸如「龍女獻珠」，「紅　盜盒」（我希望能覺一幅副本，沒有上下側靑　的孤單單的凌康的一位女俠）。「手把鋤頭的　家女」，「吉祥天　」，「北海藐姑　仙人」等幅，固然極可喜；但最令我感到喜歡的，却是觀音的諸般變相。五采紛披，令人目不暇接。作者自己最喜歡的是「觀音現將軍像」，頂盔貫甲，肌肉飽　有力，雙目尤烱烱有神，後隨小鬼，騰雲馭氣，益覺莊嚴。此外還有「立觀音」，「坐觀音」（其巾一幅未著色），「紗服觀音」，「騎象觀音」，「如意觀音」，「睜目觀音」，「楊枝灑水觀音」，「善才觀音」，「長劍觀音」等。我最愛看「眠觀音」和「魚　觀音」。睡眠看的觀音閉目垂眉地欹在山石上，更覺美麗，頂上的圓光幾乎變成花園的月洞門，罩住她的全身。魚籃觀音則斜欹着身子，左手　裳，右手提籃，監內一尾活潑鮮跳的魚，彷彿在演崑曲「隨舟」。北海畫觀音都是用極薄易滲的半料級畫的，非常工細，畫幅所佔地位極小，不過全幅的十分之一左右，上端留一方，以便題字或品許。有時雲朶繚繞，頗似圖案，我可以縮小做文藝書的封面。我看過英國Rhys　Davids所作的「佛本生故事」（Buddhist　Birth　Stoies），知道釋迦牟尼會屢次降生為農人，醫生，法官等，不料觀音也有這許多變相。作者說起，他愛　觀音，最喜歡那一雙赤足；進珊補充了一句「坦胸露乳」，我補充了一句：「這接近希臘的力興美」。我國舊日畫觀音像，每多　坐在蓮花座上，反一雙天然的足給藏了起來，大約這樣的　是印度傳入中國以後通渦了中國　禮敎的，北海則如他自己所畫的「天馬」一樣，是行空不　的，所以地所畫的與傳統的方法逈然不同，他不是趙子昂或李龍眠，而是他自己。他有他自己獨特的風格、特別是他所畫的觀音諸變相。</p>
<p>與進珊信步出門，在眼前還幻現　，手執楊枝，長劍，如　或魚　、或坐或立咸臥，旁隨小　或善才的　般　　相　，與在　　古寺後殿所見的匠人塑像，有　泥之別。我醉薰薰地像是　了一　新的敦煌石室裏的觀音　文手卷。</p>
<p>一般是會模倣因襲的書畫家，充其量也不過做到假冬心，假四王，假八大等等而已，何足道哉！</p>
<p>像焦秉貞那末吸收了西洋美術的精華，應用到中國委上去，使中國畫更其完美而放一　彩，自然値得讃揚的。這種吸收西洋藝術的精華的工作，愈到現代而愈見美妙，我們敢說將來硏究當代的國畫時，一定會發見許多特點，為前人所未敢嘗試的。中國畫在現代即不是黃金時代，至少離黃金時代已不為遠。</p>
<p>朱應鵬先生是現代國畫家中突出的一個人物。他個性是最强的，人家都說對他很難對付，在日常的事務方面，誠然朱先生自己也覺得難於對付，然在藝術方面，却正是朱先生成功的主要因素。換言之，朱先生的畫有他自己一貫的個性，決不因襲，但從前輩中的優點，他都能把握運用。加以西洋畫，他也很有硏究，因此西洋畫的特色，他也能把握得住。人物畫綫條的優秀，便是他融和了古今新舊畫派的長處。譬如對於衣褶紋的硏究，他不惜化費許多精力，從佛敎藝術裏去化費許多精力，從佛敎藝術裏去搜索，再從希臘的古代世術去求綫索，於是他就創作現代最完美的中國人物畫來了。</p>
<p>山水花卉，他也都能畫其所能地，描繪到最動人的地步，即是一方小小的石塊，所用的墨色，他也要融合了中國畫的皺法與西洋畫的陰陽的，他的作品可說都是精品，所以雖則　幅不大，却够人欣賞。眞正愛好藝術的人，我們希望能够多多欣賞朱先生的作品。</p>

<h3>The Participatory Political Council's Resident Committee Suggests the Government Improve the Treatment of Public and Private School Teachers; Cancel the Cost of Living Subsidy and Additional Salary, and Issue Salaries Based on the Price Index; The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee Resolves to Request the Implementation of Credit Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council held a temporary meeting at 3 PM on the 23rd. Chairman Jiang Yong presided. After the Secretariat reported that Huang Yanpei was unable to attend due to other matters, the meeting began. (Discussion: The committee revised and passed the suggestions on the peace treaty with Japan and submitted it to the government for consideration. The resolution to request the government to postpone various elections was retained. The resolution to request the government to quickly decide on its attitude towards the Indonesian war to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese was passed and submitted to the government for serious consideration. The resolution to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Education to order all primary and secondary schools across the country to thoroughly use Mandarin Chinese for instruction was passed and submitted to the government for consideration.) The resolution to request a thorough investigation and strict punishment of the China Trust Bureau's selling enemy property at low prices, causing losses to the national treasury, and as a warning against corruption, was passed and submitted to the government for thorough investigation and strict punishment. The resolution to request a quick increase in disaster relief funds to aid the refugees in Anhui Province, and the resolution to request a quick dispatch of senior officials to thoroughly suppress the banditry in the Dabie Mountains and Huang Mountains to curb the source of chaos, were both passed and submitted to the government for prompt handling. The resolution to request a quick allocation of 100 million in emergency funds to aid the refugees in Henan Province was passed, and the government was requested to quickly allocate funds for relief. The resolution to request the Executive Yuan to properly plan to improve the treatment of public and private school teachers, and to implement a system of livelihood loans to maintain their livelihood and encourage integrity, was revised and passed, and submitted to the government for prompt and effective handling.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The issue of improving the treatment of public and private school teachers was also discussed at the Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council on the 23rd. The proposal was submitted by three council members, Lu Qian, Fan Yu-sui, and Jiang Yong, to "request the Executive Yuan to properly plan to improve the treatment of public and private school teachers at the root, and to implement a system of livelihood loans to maintain their livelihood and encourage integrity," listing two measures: Adjust salary payment methods; Implement livelihood loans. Many council members spoke during the discussion. Yin Shuxian strongly opposed the proposal. He said that if this measure were implemented, the national treasury would bear a burden of several hundred billion yuan, which was virtually impossible. In the end, it was decided to delete the measure to implement livelihood loans, and the proposal was changed to "request the Executive Yuan to actively improve the treatment of public and private school teachers to maintain their livelihood and encourage integrity." The revised resolution was passed and submitted to the government for prompt and effective handling. The full text of the proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>(Reasons) Public and private school teachers who have maintained their integrity during the eight years of the War of Resistance have suffered immense hardships, struggling to survive, hoping to find relief after victory. However, the Communist Party has risen up in arms, and the government is suppressing the rebellion, causing prices to skyrocket and the legal tender to depreciate sharply. Since the victory, salaries have been adjusted several times, but in reality, each adjustment forces public and private school teachers to tighten their belts even further. Those whose hometowns have fallen into the Communist-controlled areas are still unable to return home. Not only is their property gone, but they are also burdened by the refugees of their fleeing families. Those who value their self-respect have fallen into desperation, while cunning people disregard everything, leading to a prevailing wind of corruption and the decline of justice. Driven by hunger, the moral climate is deteriorating. If no urgent measures are taken to remedy the situation, it will develop into an uncontrollable situation.</p>
<p>(Measures) Adjust the method of paying salaries; Completely abolish the cost of living allowance and additional salary, and allocate salaries based on the price index; Based on the price index, convert salaries into physical goods for distribution.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting again on the morning of the 23rd to review the loan proposal for civil servants submitted by Liu Zhideng and others. More than ten legislators attended, with Liu Tong presiding. Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, also attended. During the discussion, the legislators expressed strong dissatisfaction with the unequal treatment among civil servants and raised many questions to Xu Baiyuan. Xu responded separately and explained the difficulties of the loans. Some legislators also believed that the original measure of using real estate as collateral was, in fact, impossible to implement, as most civil servants do not own fixed property. It was decided to change it to credit loans. In addition, the following supplementary measures were drafted: Pay salaries according to the price index compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics; Ensure that the treatment of all agencies is equal; Abolish the distribution of physical goods. The proposal will be submitted to the Executive Yuan after being passed by the general assembly on the 25th.</p>
<h3>The Participatory Political Council's Resident Committee Requests a Thorough Investigation of the China Trust Bureau's Selling Enemy Property at Low Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Regarding the China Trust Bureau's selling enemy property at low prices, causing significant losses to the national treasury, council members Jiang Yong, Wu Zhaoxu, and Yao Tingfang have proposed to the Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council that a thorough investigation and strict punishment be carried out. The resolution was passed at the temporary meeting of the Resident Committee on the 23rd and submitted to the government for thorough investigation and strict punishment. The proposal's cause is: "For the Central Trust Bureau's selling enemy property at low prices, causing losses to the national treasury, please thoroughly investigate and strictly punish them as a warning against corruption." It is claimed that since the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau was merged into the China Trust Bureau and the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office was established, all enemy and puppet property in Shanghai has been handled solely by the bureau. The enemy property that has been sold is already uncountable. It is noted that the former Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau had valued 127 buildings of the Japanese-owned Gongda Yarn Factory in Yulin Lane, Yulin Road, Tilanqiao, at 141,158,716.68 yuan last September. Now, the bureau sold it to the original landlord this May for only 71,470,000 yuan. The land rights were for eight years. More than half a year has passed, and prices have increased more than tenfold, but the selling price has decreased by half. Who can believe that there is no embezzlement? If the Gongda Yarn Factory is like this, it is difficult to guarantee that other properties sold by the bureau are not in similar situations, causing losses to the national treasury and enriching private pockets. The competent authorities should quickly conduct a thorough investigation, and if the facts are verified, severely punish them to warn against corruption, so that the remaining materials can be sold one after another with less loss. Furthermore, the enemy and puppet real estate still held by the bureau, in addition to being allocated to various agencies, is often lent by the bureau to relatives and friends for residence without collecting any rent. It is said to be managed on behalf of the government, but it is inappropriate to use public property to do favors. Moreover, it is rumored that some people are nominally borrowing for residence but actually secretly collecting transfer fees. A thorough investigation should be carried out together. All real estate lent by the bureau to private residents that should be confiscated should be sold to benefit the state. Those that are definitely not enemy property and should not be confiscated should be returned to the original owners as soon as possible, without allowing them to be occupied by others, hindering the property rights of the owners.</p>
<h3>Bird's Eye View of Nanyang</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>Reminiscences of Following the China National Aviation Corporation's Test Flight to Nanyang, Part 6</p>
<p>This reporter accompanied the China National Aviation Corporation's test flight and traveled through several major cities in Nanyang, including Saigon, Bangkok, Singapore, and Batavia. I flew a total of 7,000 miles. Although the trip was hurried, I had many feelings based on what I heard and saw. The first and most profound impression was the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for their motherland. Whenever we flew to any city, the overseas Chinese were overjoyed when they first saw the national emblem of "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth" on the "Sky King" and the reporters who came from afar, as if they had met family members in a foreign land. They asked questions and eagerly wanted to know the current situation of the motherland. Unfortunately, we were unable to bring many moving and joyful messages.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Encounter Unprecedented Difficulties</p>
<p>The second impression is that we feel that the overseas Chinese are now encountering unprecedented difficulties. At a time when various places in Nanyang are singing the praises of nationalism and national self-determination movements, unfortunately, our overseas Chinese are the first to fall into a crisis-ridden environment, and many have even entered the "path of destruction." We saw that in the conflict in the Dutch East Indies, overseas Chinese suffered property losses and casualties in the crossfire. This is such a heartbreaking thing!</p>
<p>Looking back at the history of overseas Chinese pioneering in Nanyang, the Dutch East Indies was the earliest. Many of the overseas Chinese residing in Batavia today are already sixth-generation descendants, and some are even eighth-generation descendants. They initially reclaimed wasteland in the Dutch East Indies, working diligently and frugally, slowly transforming a desolate island into the dazzling "Golden Bird" it is today. But today, unexpectedly, there is such a terrifying and tragic scene, watching the blood and sweat and construction of the overseas Chinese for four hundred years being destroyed without a trace in the gunfire. Regarding this point, we believe that the Indonesian approach is extremely foolish and unwise. If the Indonesians really destroy everything of the overseas Chinese in this war, then what is left? It is not difficult for us to imagine that the Indonesians will have regressed four hundred years and returned to the "desolate era" of that time.</p>
<p>The so-called "a single spark can start a prairie fire," the continued hidden worries we will consider are, how can we guarantee that other small ethnic groups will not follow suit due to everything that the Indonesians have imposed on the overseas Chinese?</p>
<p>Let's turn around and look at this corner of Thailand. In recent years, the overseas Chinese community has also begun to face serious threats. Recently, the Siamese government plans to nationalize all the rice mills in the hands of the overseas Chinese (commonly called "fire mills" locally). This is undoubtedly another fatal blow to the overseas Chinese. We know that in the past, the rice produced in Siam and Saigon was almost entirely controlled by the overseas Chinese. If the overseas Chinese in Thailand lose all their rice mills, the consequences can be imagined. What follows will be a crisis of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>It is precisely because the overseas Chinese have suffered various traumas overseas that they place great expectations on their motherland. When we flew to the above-mentioned places, the overseas Chinese all earnestly hoped for a strong and unified motherland, and at least at this stage, there should be concrete actions so that they can live and work in peace in Nanyang. However, most of our consulates in various places are unable to carry out their work smoothly due to a lack of manpower and a large workload. There are 800,000 overseas Chinese in Bangkok alone, and the consulate has only fifteen staff members, and some of these 800,000 overseas Chinese are scattered in various small towns. How can these fifteen government workers take care of everything?</p>
<p>At a time when anti-Chinese movements are rampant in various parts of Nanyang, our country's foreign propaganda work in Southeast Asia deserves special attention from the authorities. Although our country has no intentions in this region, it is our nation's "window" and the outer line of our economy. The actions of the local governments and people have a great influence on us. The United Kingdom and the United States have established news agencies in major cities in Nanyang to provide local newspapers with photos and written materials, or to establish reading rooms to provide illustrated magazines for free. It is essential that we immediately develop election work. This reporter believes that if our foreign propaganda work in Southeast Asia is done well, it will be more effective than our international propaganda in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The people of Nanyang have no understanding of any of our country's problems at present. After the China National Aviation Corporation plane landed in Bangkok, the Thais came to ask if the plane was being flown by Americans. They simply did not believe that Chinese people could fly planes. In Batavia, Indonesians asked reporters: Is your country's capital in Shanghai? All of this proves the urgent need for us to strengthen international propaganda in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Chairman and Wife Donate Property to Help the Church Run Schools</h3>

<h3>President Zhang Arrives in Beiping; Inspects Northeast and Believes Officials are Aware and Vigilant; Will Stay for Two or Three Days Before Heading to Chahar, Suiyuan, Jin and Lu</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 23rd] President Zhang Qun arrived in Beiping at 12:00 noon on the 23rd on a special plane from Shenyang. Accompanying him were Deng Youde, Zhou Junliang, Fu Boping, and five others. The weather in the old capital was clear after the rain today, and the autumn sun shone brightly on the Xiyuan Airport. More than a hundred officials, including Li Zongren, Sun Yunzhong, and He Siyuan, came to the airport to greet him. When the door of the plane opened, Zhang, wearing a dark blue Western suit, stepped off the plane with a smile and exchanged greetings with the senior officials who welcomed him. He then rode in the same car as Li Zongren into the city and went straight to the Customs Hostel to rest. Song Ziwen also stayed here when he came to Beiping in the past. President Zhang immediately met with reporters and said that he had been away from Beiping for fourteen years. He first visited Beiping in the thirty-third year of Guangxu to take the exam for studying abroad. Since then, he has come to Beiping from time to time. The last time was in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. He saw that the potted flowers displayed along the street at Xisi Archway were still the same as they were more than ten years ago, so he felt very much at home. He plans to stay in Beiping for two or three days this time. He would like to visit Zhang Heng, Gui Suiyuan, Taiyuan, and Jinan, but the itinerary is yet to be arranged. As for the trip to South China, he is afraid that he will have to return to Nanjing to deal with accumulated official business before it can be realized. He plans to go to various places to see how the implementation of government orders is and to investigate the hardships of the people and the lives of refugees, so as to lay the foundation for relief work. In addition, he is eager to see the current situation of the industrial and mining units left by the enemy and puppets in North China. The specific inspection program in Beiping is being arranged by the municipal government. When asked about his impressions of the Northeast, President Zhang said: Mencius once said, "When one bears the burden, one's heart is in danger; when one is worried, one's thoughts are deep." This can be a true portrayal of the state of mind of those in power in the Northeast. They are very clear about the importance, complexity, and seriousness of the Northeast, and they know to be vigilant. After Director Chen took office, all departments are setting an example to cooperate, and efficiency can be strengthened. The people of the Northeast support the central government's suppression of the rebellion, and their emotions are enthusiastic. When he arrived in Changchun, more than a thousand people welcomed him in the streets. After fourteen years of enemy and puppet rule, they eagerly hope to return to the embrace of the central government and live in peace. When Zhang left Changchun for Shenyang yesterday, the weather was dark and rainy, and it was extremely dangerous. Zhang's staff still have lingering fears when talking about it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] In the afternoon of the 23rd, President Zhang answered questions and visited Director Li, and exchanged views on the president of Peking University, Hu Shi, and the famous scholars of Beiping, Zeng Xiang and Gu Zhongxiu.

President Zhang is scheduled to attend the municipal government's morning meeting on the 24th and then inspect the Shijingshan Power Plant and Iron and Steel Plant.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 23rd] Zhang Qun and his entourage left Pan at 9:20 AM on the 23rd and flew to Beiping. Chen Cheng and other heads of agencies went to the airport to see them off.

It is internally decided that Guan Jiyu, the political deputy of the Ministry of Grain, will postpone his trip to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Decides to Purchase Vehicles from the Shenyang Machinery Plant, Affecting the Solution of the Jiang Mining Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Zhiyang Dispatch on the 23rd] President Zhang Qun inspected the Northeast for four days, investigated the general situation in the Northeast, and solved many important problems. Zhang diligently sought out the people's hardships, did not sit still, and did not waste resources, giving the people of the Northeast an excellent impression. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant of the National Resources Commission manufactured five locomotives and one hundred freight cars, which were stored in the factory. A certain department did not buy them, and the factory was in a dangerous situation because it could not sell these goods worth about 60 billion legal tender. Anshan Iron and Steel's products were indirectly affected. It is also reported that the Kaiyuan Coal Mine has 550,000 tons of coal in storage, worth about 200 million yuan, but there are no cars to transport it out. The people in the industrial areas of Beijing and Shanghai are all affected, and the Kaiyuan Mine is also affected. The problem of 100 tons of locomotives and cars, which is recognized as a strange thing, has been solved, directly and indirectly affecting the industrial and mining industries of the Northeast and North China.</p>
<h3>Japan's Early Reparations Drawn Yesterday in Tokyo, Our Country Allocated Nearly Half of the First Batch</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The allocation of the first batch of equipment reparations made by Japan to the Allied countries has now been determined. At that time, our country will draw machinery tools and auxiliary metalworking equipment, a total of 9,780 pieces, as an early transfer of reparations. This accounts for 30% of the early transfer of reparations. The first batch of allocations totaled 19,700 pieces of machinery tools. When the draw was made today, it was divided into two numbers. Our country drew the even number, while the British, representing the Philippines and the Netherlands, drew the odd number. Wu Ban-chen, the head of our country's "Reparations and Restitution" delegation, represented our country in the draw. The ones drawn by the British are for the other half of the 30% of the early transfer of reparations, which will be allocated among the British, Philippines, and Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Regarding private business representatives going to Japan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has notified each district to report according to regulations for the first three batches within a limited time.

<h3>People Suffering from Deafness, Blindness, Muteness, and Madness Can be Elected as People's Representatives; The Judicial Yuan's Explanatory Letter Responds to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Executive Yuan previously stated that people who are blind, mute, deaf, or mad have obvious difficulties in performing their duties and asked the Judicial Yuan to interpret whether they can be elected as representatives of county and township people's representative organs or township chiefs. According to the Judicial Yuan's reply, the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference of the Yuan decided: if such people are elected, it cannot be legally considered that their election is invalid. Even if it is difficult for them to perform their duties, there is no way to remove them from office except through legal procedures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The election methods for National Assembly representatives from national vocational groups were amended at the joint business meeting held on the 22nd by the Election General Office and the national vocational group election offices. The new method is that candidates for National Assembly representatives from vocational groups should be jointly signed by districts and industries, and voting should be conducted by district, and the number of votes should be counted by district. Except for one person with the most votes in each district being elected as the basic number for each district, and women's representatives being counted separately by totaling the national votes, the remaining seats will be determined by comprehensively comparing the names of those with the next most votes in each district nationwide, arranging the list by the number of votes, and determining their election.</p>
<h3>The Participatory Political Council's Resident Committee Decides to Retain the Proposal to Postpone the General Election</h3>
<p>[Mu Bao, Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The opinion of some council members that the election should be postponed was raised again at the Resident Committee of the Participatory Political Council on the 23rd, but it was still decided to retain it. In addition to the council members, some National Assembly representatives also have the same feeling. When the Resident Committee met on the 23rd, Cai Zhisheng, Yu Nanqiu, and Lu Qian proposed "Requesting the government to postpone various elections," listing six reasons, briefly: It is not appropriate to disperse forces and shift goals during the period of suppressing the rebellion. At a time of economic hardship, the cost of campaigning violates the principle of frugality. Campaigning scandals are unprecedented, and people of integrity disdain to campaign, while corrupt people can fortunately advance; such elections are difficult to achieve the effect of selecting the wise and capable. The degree of friendly countries' assistance to us depends entirely on our military and political strength; elections are not the point they pay attention to. The proportional allocation of seats for each party seems to need to be considered. The current situation is more difficult than it was during last year's National Assembly. Due to the circumstances of the times, it may not be possible to change the policy according to the times. The proposal put forward two methods: Request the government to quickly solicit the opinions of the National Assembly representatives by means of communication. Request the government to quickly convene a meeting of the Legislative Committee to discuss the issue of postponing the election. Many council members spoke during the discussion, and Zhang Qianhua opposed it most strongly, saying that points 3 to 6 of the reasons for the original proposal were completely unreasonable. Because there were many opponents to the proposal, it was finally decided to retain it.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming Flies from Taiwan to Shanghai to Discuss Financial Issues in Taiwan Province; Will Return to Jiangxi in the Next Few Days to Elect National Representatives</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 23rd] The Chairman of Taiwan Province, Wei Daoming, flew to Shanghai this morning. He will visit Zhang Jia'ao, the President of the Central Bank, to discuss financial issues in Taiwan Province. The official rate of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender is currently set at 1:72, but the black market rate is 1:52 and is trending lower. The Bank of Taiwan lacks funds, and the exchange between Taiwan and Shanghai has not been smooth, which is one of the reasons for the devaluation of the Taiwan dollar in the black market. Another reason is that recently, some businessmen in Taiwan are collecting legal tender and taking it to Hong Kong and Guangdong to sell and buy smuggled goods. It is reported that Wei will discuss with Zhang the issue of borrowing and allocating legal tender funds and restricting the amount of legal tender that can be taken from Taiwan Province to Hong Kong and Guangdong. Wei will also return to his hometown in Jiangxi for a trip and return to Taiwan in about two weeks.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Meeting for Peace with Japan to Proceed as Planned by the U.S.; Our Diplomatic Measures Focus on Stance Regarding Peace Treaty with Japan; Recommendations for Participation Sent to Government for Consideration</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] A State Department spokesman stated: "The United States is proceeding according to its original plan for convening a preliminary meeting for peace with Japan and hopes that China can participate. Regarding the suggestion that the Japanese peace conference be presided over by the Far Eastern Commission, the United States has not received any such suggestion from the Chinese side." This statement from the State Department seems to clarify various conflicting reports from the outside.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 22nd] Canadian Minister of National Defence Claxton, upon returning here on the evening of the 22nd from the Canberra Conference, stated that he hopes a conference including the Soviet Union will be held in New York in the coming days to discuss the treaty of peace with Japan. Although the conference will use a two-thirds majority voting system, opposing veto power, this procedure is deemed necessary "based on the experience in Paris."</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 23rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shih-shun reported on diplomatic measures at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 23rd, mainly reiterating our stance on the peace treaty with Japan. He stated that the opinions of the four powers should converge and that the veto power should be retained.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] At today's extraordinary meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council, thirteen suggestions regarding the content of the peace treaty from the "Recommendations of the Council Regarding the Peace Treaty with Japan" proposed by the Council's Japan Policy Research Committee, along with the two suggestions passed at the fifth meeting of the Standing Committee on the 19th, totaling fifteen suggestions, were amended and passed. They will be submitted to the government for adoption. The original text of the fifteen suggestions is recorded below: Preliminary consultations on the peace treaty with Japan should still be conducted by the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union before being submitted to a conference of the relevant eleven nations for discussion. The discussion and signing of the peace treaty with Japan should not await amendments involving the veto power (the above two points were passed at the meeting on the 19th). The Japanese Emperor system, being the embodiment of the spirit of aggression, should be abolished. Japanese military industrial facilities and heavy weaponry should be completely destroyed. The level of Japanese industry should be limited to that necessary to maintain the essential living standards of the Japanese people, and if an annual measure is necessary, it should be based on the level before 1928. The calculation of reparations should be based on the duration of the war and the public and private losses incurred during the war. Japanese domestic and overseas assets and industrial facilities (including textiles) should all be used as assets for reparations. Gold, silver, jewels, and ancient books and artifacts looted by Japan in China should all be returned to China and should not be considered as reparations. Islands outside the Japanese territory as stipulated by the Cairo Declaration, should be placed under trusteeship, with the Ryukyu Islands under Chinese trusteeship. Japanese war criminals should be promptly tried by military law and severely punished, with the aim of concluding this before the peace conference. The Japanese education system's curriculum and teaching materials should be thoroughly revised to eliminate the resurgence of aggressive ideologies. After the signing of the peace treaty, a "Supervisory and Implementation Committee" should be organized by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to supervise Japan's implementation of the peace treaty. The control period is tentatively set at 30 years, and the control period may be extended if Japan violates the peace treaty. If Japan violates the peace treaty, force may be used for sanctions, to be jointly executed by consultation between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The signing of the peace treaty should take place in China.</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Warns Government Not to Hesitate Further on China Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The Scripps-Howard newspaper chain warned, as Truman and Marshall are carefully considering Wedemeyer's report on China, "The situation in China is deteriorating due to the hesitant and passive actions taken by the U.S. government." The paper also reviewed the U.S. policy toward China since the Yalta Agreement, hoping that "from now on, what we wish to do should be neither too little nor too late." The newspaper's editorial headline was "The War in China is Not a Phony War." It stated, "When we were destroying the Japanese Empire, our declared post-war policy was to help establish a strong China as a bulwark of peace in the Far East, but in reality, almost every move we made resulted in weakening China. When we carried out the Yalta deal, we forced our ally (China) to cede the privileges of Outer Mongolia, Lushun Port, Dalian, and the Northeast Railway to the Soviet Union, yet we failed to make the Soviet Union abide by its responsibilities in this transaction. Such a brutal cession of the territory and sovereignty of an allied country by the United States will inevitably cause America's prestige in China to decline to an irreparable level."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The White House announced today that the date for Wedemeyer's meeting with President Truman has not yet been decided. He may meet with Secretary Marshall before meeting with the President. At the same time, a State Department spokesperson stated that Wedemeyer's report will only be released after the President has studied it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] A well-known foreign neutral observer and international diplomacy expert here told our agency that China should not align itself completely with either the Soviet Union or the United States. He believes that Vice Chairman Sun's statement advocating that China adopt an effective diplomatic policy, and China's taking the same stance as the Soviet Union against the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, are both pertinent. He believes that to prevent China from being subjected to Japanese aggression again, China should resolutely demand the complete disarmament of Japan and the elimination of Japan's aggressive tendencies.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Strict Compliance with Measures for Dealing with Communist Party Members in the Rear</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan has submitted the measures for dealing with Communist Party members in the rear to the National Government for approval and record. It has separately telegraphed the provincial and municipal governments to strictly comply with the regulations. The original text is as follows: The measures for dealing with Communist Party members in the rear, formulated by this Yuan, have been submitted to the National Government for approval and record, and are hereby circulated for enforcement. Since the old nest of the Communist bandits in Yan'an has been destroyed and the main force in Shandong has been defeated, they are running around like startled pigs, everywhere. Many of the people who were coerced into joining the chaos have defected and returned, and the bandits lurking in the rear vainly hope to take advantage of the chaos. At this time, the government should, on the one hand, take the principle of not punishing those who have been coerced, and offer amnesty to the people who have defected from the front lines, and on the other hand, hold the heart of eliminating evil, thoroughly investigate the hidden bandits in the rear, so that those who sincerely surrender will have a way to rehabilitate themselves, and those who secretly communicate with the bandits will have no chance to escape. It will be easier to quell the rebellion and get the people out of the water. The purpose of the promulgation of the measures for dealing with Communist Party members in the rear is just this. Now that it has been circulated by the National Government for enforcement, local governments at all levels should immediately comply with the regulations and earnestly implement them, so as to achieve real results. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China and the United States Should Truly Understand Each Other – Reflections After Reading Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Speech at the International Women's Conference</h3>
<p>The International Women's Conference was held in the capital the day before yesterday, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek attended and delivered a speech, suggesting that members of the conference understand the Chinese people's thinking by studying and exploring China's cultural treasures, and hoping that they can truly understand China and become important links in promoting international understanding after returning to their countries, thereby building peace in the future world. Madame Chiang Kai-shek's original speech was very long, but two sentences are most worthy of consideration by friendly countries: She said, "China has recently undergone the pain of fire and blood, and although our heads are covered in blood, we have not lowered our heads." She also said, "Regardless of whether we receive assistance from the world or not, we are prepared to strive for success and fight to the end." Madame Chiang Kai-shek not only spoke for the people of our country, expressing the attitude we wanted to express, but also humbly requested that international mutual understanding be further promoted.</p>
<p>We believe that today, mutual understanding between the two major allies of China and the United States is particularly urgently needed, not only for the sake of China and the United States, but also for the peace of the future world. We firmly oppose unnecessary accusations and causing unnecessary misunderstandings to the other party.</p>
<p>For example, the "naive" remarks made by Mr. Acheson on the 26th of this month in an interview with the United Press, and the criticism of the "wishful thinking" made in the statement when Special Envoy Wedemeyer left China, could really have been avoided. It was reported that Mr. Sun had told a United Press reporter: "After General Wedemeyer submits his report to President Truman, the Chinese government will study whether it is more beneficial for China to unite with the United States or with the Soviet Union. If China is forced to lean towards the Soviet Union, the government and the Communist Party will inevitably reach a peaceful resolution." Therefore, American people mainly believe that "if China really has this idea, it is a 'naive' effort." And at this moment, the attitude of our Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly seems to be slightly different from the past, and on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, he insisted on using the veto power of the major powers in the preliminary meeting of the eleven countries on peace with Japan, which on the surface formed a consistent action between China and the Soviet Union. The general public is even more speculating and misunderstanding our country's current foreign policy, saying that China will follow the traditional trick of "using barbarians to control barbarians" to place itself between the United States and the Soviet Union, or that the words and deeds of the Chinese authorities are close to making empty threats. In fact, judging from the history of friendship between China and the United States, if there are any reported misunderstandings, it is not only the misfortune of the two countries, but also, as Madame Chiang Kai-shek said, there is indeed a need to intensify the promotion of international understanding.</p>
<p>We have no way of knowing whether the United Press's report about Mr. Sun's remarks is accurate or whether it is consistent with Mr. Sun's original intentions. Even if it is as reported by the United Press, this remark can only express Mr. Sun's personal intentions at most, and it cannot be used to judge the government's decision-making. According to reports, "official sources in Nanjing believe that Mr. Sun's recent remarks on the current situation only represent his personal views and are not enough to reflect the government's dynamics," which shows that Mr. Sun's remarks cannot represent the government's intentions, just as Mr. Wallace's remarks cannot necessarily represent American policy in every sentence. As for our country's attitude towards the peace treaty with Japan and the issue of veto power, it is originally based on our country's inherent position and cannot be confused with Mr. Sun's remarks. Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, the National Political Council and the Foreign Ministry's Peace Treaty Review Committee have carefully discussed it and both believe that the Soviet Union must participate in the peace conference with Japan, and the four major powers should retain veto power in the conference. Because China and Japan are geographically close and have suffered from the aggression of Japanese militarism for a long time, the harm is particularly severe. For its own security, it cannot allow the resurgence of Japanese aggression, so it naturally pays special attention to the peace treaty with Japan. Moreover, there are still many issues to be resolved between China and the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union cannot be excluded from the peace treaty. Therefore, although China's decision-making on the peace treaty with Japan may be similar to that of the Soviet Union in appearance, it is completely based on an independent position, and its meaning may not be the same as that of the Soviet Union. Judging from the fact that Australia also advocates retaining veto power, it can be seen that countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression or been threatened by Japanese aggression all have the same feeling about this.</p>
<p>Speaking of our foreign policy, it has its consistent policy and firm position. When the founding father was dying, he entrusted us: "Unite with the nations of the world that treat us as equals and fight together," that is to say, we will be friends with all nations that are friendly to us. The Confucian tradition of China for two thousand years only knows loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, reverence, kinship, and good neighborliness, and will never allow us to engage in so-called "threats" or "blackmail" and other dishonorable behaviors. As for the so-called "using barbarians to control barbarians," in this day and age, there will never be such an overly "naive" person who speaks before doing. Just as Palmerston said at the time, "Britain has no permanent friends, nor permanent enemies." If we bring it up again today, it will inevitably be too "naive." We recall that when Mr. Sun made his remarks, it was just after General Wedemeyer, President Truman's special envoy, issued his statement leaving China and before he was about to provide a report. We certainly know that Mr. Wedemeyer's statement may also have good intentions, but as a special envoy, with a hasty time, the visits may not have been detailed, and the investigations may not have been completely accurate. And when the mission was completed and he was leaving China and returning home, the publication of the statement not only damaged the self-esteem of the Chinese people, but also was an impolite act for a special envoy with diplomatic status, and the indignant emotions of the Chinese people could be seen everywhere. It is the same as Mr. Sun's remarks that are easy to cause misunderstandings among American friends. Therefore, we recall Chairman Chiang's conversation with American reporters in July, which was: China "welcomes any constructive criticism." People who are reporters should especially try to reduce misunderstandings between nations. We hope that the people of both China and the United States can encourage each other in this regard.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign policy, China and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other, and the length of the border between them is unparalleled in the world. Although China and the Soviet Union have different founding ideologies, being good neighbors is undoubtedly our country's inevitable effort. As for the United States and us, we face each other across the Pacific Ocean. Since this war of resistance against Japan, the traditional friendship between China and the United States has been baptized by blood and fire and has become more solidified. We cherish the friendship between China and the United States, and we do not want to see any misunderstandings in the relationship between China and the United States, or even in China's foreign relations. Chairman Chiang said at a reception for American reporters: "The Chinese people will always be friends of the United States"! Our friendship with the United States has always been firm, and we hope that the United States' friendship with us will also always be firm.</p>

<h3>Lie Makes Urgent Appeal: All Countries Should Eliminate Differences; General Debate of the General Assembly Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: The general debate of the United Nations General Assembly has concluded, and the Chairman announced a recess until Thursday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: United Nations Secretary-General Lie today made a direct appeal to major powers, hoping to reconcile Eastern and Western differences, because this divergence is brewing terror and hatred all over the world. Lie's appeal was made to the United Nations General Assembly, and although he did not directly mention Marshall or Vyshinsky, the target of his appeal was clearly the United States and the Soviet Union. Lie said: "An indispensable condition for peace is the joint efforts of countries with different social systems and benefits to find a way to live together peacefully. All difficulties must be resolved through negotiations, and there should be sincerity in seeking compromise. Otherwise, international peace and security cannot be maintained." Lie said: Although differences exist between major powers, they have not yet reached the point of threatening the survival of the United Nations organization, but they are enough to hinder the activities of the United Nations, making it impossible for it to exert its due effect. He also said: "I do not believe that these differences will lead to war, because all countries in the world hope to prevent another war from happening. The greatest difficulty today is the mutual suspicion between major powers, and the psychology of fear is the greatest danger, because fear can produce hatred, and hatred can create a crisis, which is an inevitable trend." Lie believes that the United Nations</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Launches Another Attack on the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: After United Nations Secretary-General Lie made an urgent appeal, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately began to speak, attacking the United States for submitting the Korean issue to the General Assembly with all his might, and advocated that the issue be removed from the agenda, on the grounds that the Korean issue should be handled jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union, and that the United States' move clearly violated the US-Soviet agreement. In addition, Vyshinsky expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the inclusion of the issue of revising the peace treaty with Italy on the agenda, believing that this move was untimely and lacked legal basis, because the period from the time the treaty was ratified was only one week. Some countries obviously want to use the revision of the peace treaty with Italy as a means to achieve their selfish goals, he said.</p>
<h3>European Sixteen-Nation Conference Concludes; British Foreign Secretary Urges: World Economy Faces Collapse Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] After the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan approved the final report of the conference, the chairman of the last meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, gave a speech at the meeting, asking the United States to accept Europe's demands, pointing out that Europe has paid the greatest price in life, suffering, and destruction, and this is not a plea for pity. The American people and Congress should now decide whether to allow Europe to help build world peace and prosperity. The misfortune of Europe will cause the collapse of most of the world's economic system. Bevin then urged the participating countries not to be affected by any divisive forces and to continue the reconstruction plan.</p>
<p>Within Months</p>
<p>A New Situation Will Arise Bevin said: Within weeks, at most months, we will face the world's only situation. Poverty, famine, and widespread unemployment, although they have existed in the past, were all caused by the destruction of law and order, or the collapse of the world's economic system; today, Europe's needs cannot be met only because of the lack of a way to pay foreign debts. After this crisis is fully developed, there is no historical precedent to judge what form it will take. French Acting Foreign Minister Taittinger then gave a speech, expressing regret for the inability of all European countries to participate in the conference, and declared that the door is still open, and countries that have not participated can still participate.</p>
<p>Italian Famine</p>
<p>Will Cause Revolution Italian Foreign Minister Sforza said that if the lack of bread in Italy continues for another two or three months, a revolution will inevitably break out. This is not the result of doctrine, but the result of famine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The report unanimously passed by the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall European Aid Plan has been published simultaneously in Paris and London after the meeting.</p>
<p>For the Next Four Years</p>
<p>Need More Than 20 Billion It is estimated that the amount of aid needed by Europe in the next four years is US$22.44 billion. Except for the US$3.11 billion that is hoped to be provided by the International Reconstruction Bank to purchase major equipment, the remaining US$19.33 billion needs to be allocated by the United States. In addition, in order to restore the financial stability of several European countries and fulfill the production plan under the European self-help plan, another US$3 billion in aid is needed. This self-help plan is scheduled to be completed in 1951, and its content includes restoring pre-war grain production, increasing pre-war food rations and supply, and increasing coal production to 30 million tons more than before the war, and increasing power generation to two-thirds more than before the war.</p>
<h3>Domestic and International Situations Become Increasingly Urgent; Important Consultations in the White House; Truman to Announce Decisions on the Weekend</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] It is reported that President Truman is considering possible answers to urgent issues such as high domestic prices and overseas hunger on the 23rd. It is also heard that his final decision will include whether to convene a special parliament, how to compensate for the shortages in Europe, and to what extent to require the American people to economize.</p>
<p>The main points of the plan submitted to the President by the Truman Cabinet Food Committee on the 23rd are: Not taking firm emergency action, but only strictly reducing American grain exports, which may have an effect on reducing American inflation, but may hinder American foreign policy. Slightly reduce grain exports, and at the same time implement a comprehensive automatic food rationing plan, so that there is surplus food available for export. It is reported that most of the President's senior advisors advocate adopting this solution, believing that it is a moderate approach. Strive to reach 567 million bushels of grain, which can be compared with last year's record-breaking export. This will be a non-voluntary austerity plan, and the government must be granted the necessary powers by convening a special session of Congress. The last approach is obviously no longer under discussion. Most senior officials seem to have agreed that by the time an effective control plan can be implemented, it will be too late. Even Marshall has lost his enthusiasm for convening a special Congress. According to a senior Republican congressional leader, if a special Congress is convened, it must be until December, at which time it will be only a few weeks away from the regular congressional session in January. Judging from various situations, Truman clearly has no intention of convening a meeting quickly, and it is reported that he is willing to make a decision after listening to opinions from all parties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The American policy that will affect the fate of Europe this winter is being carefully discussed by President Truman and his cabinet members. The meetings held today include: A cabinet food problem group meeting composed of Secretary of State Marshall, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, and Secretary of Agriculture Anderson. A two-hour meeting was held today to formulate a plan to increase food exports as much as possible and suppress domestic food prices. Marshall is now going to the White House to report to the President on the diplomatic situation, especially focusing on the needs of Europe. A meeting of all cabinet members will be held at lunch time at the White House. After the meeting, the President, accompanied by his special economic advisor Steelman, will hold another meeting with the cabinet food group to listen to its report. The results of these meetings will produce the American government's decision-making to deal with the domestic crisis and the European economic crisis. It is reported that Truman may announce his plan this weekend.</p>
<h3>British and American Rescue Efforts Fail; Petkov Hanged</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sofia, 23rd] Bulgarian opposition leader Nikola Petkov, leader of the National Agrarian Union, was executed by hanging in the northern suburbs of Sofia at midnight yesterday. His appeal after being sentenced to death was rejected by the Supreme Court as unreasonable. Petkov was arrested three months ago for allegedly conspiring to overthrow the government and was sentenced to death. The British and American governments repeatedly protested to the Bulgarian government, the Allied Control Council in Sofia, and Moscow, demanding a re-examination of Petkov's death sentence and protesting the method of the trial, but were all rejected.</p>
<h3>Dutch Government Announces Policy Toward Indonesia; Report of the Consular Corps to be Completed This Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 23rd] Dutch Prime Minister Beel announced Indonesia policy in the Lower House today, saying it would immediately abolish the Dutch Committee in Batavia and set up a central agency to negotiate with the Republic of Indonesia. He also revealed that the Dutch government would submit a bill to Congress to amend the Dutch Constitution so that the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies could establish a new relationship. Beel said he believed the report of the consular corps in Batavia would be beneficial to the Netherlands. He also said that the situation in Indonesia cannot continue like this and hoped that the Security Council would pay attention. Governor-General Van Mook can return to Batavia from Ceylon tonight. At the same time, the consular corps in Batavia held another meeting this morning, and its investigation report is expected to be completed this weekend.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Pandit Broadcasts, Urging Attention to the Suffering of the People of Asia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 22nd] Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union and chief representative to the General Assembly, Mrs. Pandit, tonight broadcast a speech to the Far East, pointing out that the world is paying daily attention to the famine threat in Europe, but comparatively little attention is paid to the suffering of hundreds of millions of people in Asia. Mrs. Pandit said that India's pursuit of freedom, peace, and justice is more enthusiastic than any other country in the world. We should do our best to strengthen the United Nations organization. The Indian people feel that the division of India is a painful blow. We hope that through our work within and outside the United Nations organization, India and Pakistan can recognize the division of land in the short term, and it should not be a "division of interests" for the people of the two countries. Mrs. Pandit continued, in order to maintain world peace, we deeply hope that the Netherlands can recognize how Britain has abandoned its right to rule other countries in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Mrs. Pandit then condemned the current war propaganda, pointing it out as dangerous propaganda, which would lead to war in the long run.</p>
<h3>Japanese Zaibatsu Groups Strive to Resist; Elimination of Economic Power Concentration Act; Demand the Implementation of "Autonomous" Financial Control</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The coalition cabinet led by Tetsuo Katayama, the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party, intends to express some forms of economic democratization in the Economic Power Concentration Elimination Act because the state-owned coal project has not fully implemented the Socialist Party's policies. However, the contents of the bill immediately aroused strong opposition from the Japanese Zaibatsu forces.</p>
<p>Recently, the Economic Doyukai, led by Sozo Hotta, vice president of Sumitomo Bank, one of the four major Japanese Zaibatsu, issued a so-called "Financial Control Democratization Plan" to resist. The main points of the plan are as follows: Establish a financial committee composed of private financial institutions, the Bank of Japan, and representatives of depositors to implement the first-person non-bureaucratic financial control. Each financial institution shall follow the principle that each shareholder shall not hold more than one-twentieth of the total capital stock. Reorganize special financial institutions, implement the unification of financial administration, and open up local finance, allowing the establishment of local banks.</p>
<h3>Japanese Floods Have Not Receded; Epidemics Follow</h3>

The Ministry of Health and Welfare is currently busy with epidemic prevention work.</p>
<h3>Soviet Satellite Countries Speak, Involving Our Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Flushing Meadow, 22nd] After British Representative McNeil gave a speech, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Schmiek reiterated the Soviet Union's criticisms of Western countries at the United Nations General Assembly today, saying, "According to official American data, the amount of war materials shipped to China by the United States in the first three months after the cessation of hostilities was even more than the total amount of materials shipped to China during World War II. How will the countries that accept this large amount of aid fare? How is China?" Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky also criticized the United States' aid to China, saying, "This action by the United States violates the prohibition of the United Nations Charter against interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and shameless war profiteers continue to support the reactionary groups in China, Palestine, and Greece."</p>
<h3>Reconstructing Siberia to Become the Heart of the Soviet Union; Stalin's Ideal Can Be Realized</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] Raymond, the former head of the Soviet Economic Department of the Army Department, wrote in the "United Nations World" magazine today, reporting that Stalin's dream of transforming Siberia into the heart of the Soviet Union is about to be realized. According to records, the Soviet Union has secretly built 100 new industrial cities in accordance with the current five-year plan, and is striving to turn a wilderness into a key production center, which shows that the Soviet Union is taking steps to revive the industrial economy destroyed by the war. Although very few people in the country know about these cities, and the latest maps do not include them, only a few have been named, and the rest are temporarily collectively referred to as "Besimyanka," which means "nameless city," and are awaiting the use of Stalin and Molotov's names to change and then call them. The purpose of building these cities is not to promote or attract tourists, but to accommodate large factories, hydroelectric power plants, mines, and railway junctions, and to provide housing for hundreds of thousands of workers from all over the country.</p>
<h3>"Mechanical Brain" Pilots Airplane Successfully Across the Atlantic</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The US Air Force announced today that a C-54 four-engine Skymaster aircraft has safely crossed the Atlantic Ocean without pilot control, arriving at Brize Norton near Oxford, England. The plane took off from Stephenville, Newfoundland, at 11:00 PM on Sunday and arrived at Brize Norton ten hours and fifteen minutes later, a total distance of 2,400 miles. This unmanned flight was a US Air Force test flight. It is said that this unmanned aircraft is controlled by a complete "mechanical brain." Everything related to the flight, including time, radio waves, and driving, is automatically controlled by the machine. Before takeoff, the "mechanical brain" only needs to be aligned, and then the destination indicator button is pressed, which automatically calculates the required time, speed, and head and tail wind speeds, so that it can arrive at the destination at a certain time. There were fourteen people on board this test flight, including nine reserve pilots for emergency use. However, no one touched the controls during the entire journey. This is the first unmanned flight across the Atlantic in history.</p>

<h3>Second Day of Senate Assembly: Many Inquiries Raised on Municipal Facilities, Mostly Regarding Police and Social Affairs</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The fourth session of the Municipal Senate Assembly held its second meeting yesterday from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Senators raised inquiries regarding the city's civil affairs, police affairs, social affairs, finance, and health. Mayor Wu, Director Zhang Xiaosong, Director Yu Shuping, Director Tian Yongqian, and Director Wu Kaixian then answered them one by one. Health issues will be answered this afternoon according to the agenda. At the same time, inquiries will also be raised regarding public utilities, public works, land administration, health, and education administration, which will then be answered by the relevant directors. The senators' inquiries and the directors' replies are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Social Affairs: Zhang Zhongyuan inquired: The regulations for donations for municipal construction for automobiles stipulate that 3.6 billion should be used for relief, but when visiting the children's home, why was it said that only rice was received (enough to eat until next New Year) and no money was received? The children's home on MacTaggart Road, which had 200 children, has been moved to Caohejing Children's Home, and the original site has been converted into a women's home. However, the original place could accommodate 200 people, so why are only 20 women now being accommodated? Can the Social Bureau continue to take in street children in the future? Lu Huiming asked about the organizational situation of the women's home and hoped that it could accommodate more prostitutes, etc., so that they could learn handicrafts to make a legitimate living.</p>
<h3>Carrying Mauser Pistols to Rob People: Difficulties in Managing the Home. Director Wu Felt Ashamed for Being Unable to Cope.</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu first replied that the reason why the women's home cannot accommodate more people after the children's home was converted into a women's home is due to the lack of funds and food. Director Wu replied that the budgeted revenue for the relief fund from the automotive construction donation for the first half of the year should be 1.79732 billion yuan, but the Social Bureau itself has not yet received it. Previously, 1 billion yuan was borrowed from the Municipal Bank at an interest rate of 2%, which has been used to purchase rice, so it is a fact that the children's home only received rice and no money. In the past, the central government stipulated that the food expenses for the shelter should be 16,000 yuan per person per month. After submitting a request, the central government has approved an increase to 25,000 yuan from September. The management of the women's home is actually very difficult. For example, if a prostitute is taken in, someone will come to rob her after three to five days. One prostitute came to the home, and a man suddenly came and said he was her husband and depended on her for support. If the prostitute entered the home, he would have no food to eat. An old woman said that after her daughter-in-law entered the home, she and her grandson had nothing to live on and insisted on taking her back. They initially used soft tactics, and then brought Mauser pistols. Finally, they led plainclothes or armed men to rob her. As many as a dozen people have been robbed in this situation. Such strange phenomena in Shanghai and the deterioration of social customs to this point make me feel ashamed that I cannot cope with it. I have now contacted the police bureaus of various branches and asked them to send armed police officers to protect them at any time. However, the expansion of relief efforts is also urgent. According to my idea, it is best to send old women, children, and husbands to the shelter. The surplus funds from the construction donation are intended to expand the relief funds. Street children will continue to be taken in to ensure that the shelter is not vacant.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Shandong Native Association Dispute</h3>
<p>Fei Shusheng requested the truth about the Shandong Native Association dispute in Shanghai be made public. Director Wu replied: This issue is very complicated. The Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road was established in the teens of the Republic of China. During the enemy-puppet period, Su Chengde became the president and changed it to the Native Association, which is actually unreasonable, because the Shandong Guild Hall is a financial group, while the Native Association is a social group. Later, the association ran Wuxun School, which was run by the Democratic League. Since it was not registered and there were frequent disturbances, after investigation, it was found that the school was run by the former subordinates of Su Chengde of the Shandong Native Association. In order to maintain social stability, the government ordered the school to be closed. However, the school's principals, Zhang Naiqi and others, refused, so it had no choice but to order the guild hall to stop its activities and run the school. After mediation by various parties, in addition to the original eleven principals of the guild hall, four young Shandong people were added to jointly organize a Native Association, but this was opposed by the old committee members. Then, Ma Deng published an advertisement, and it was said that the advertisement cost 50 million yuan. Standing in the position of supervising social organizations, I have the right to handle it. Moreover, it is not appropriate for both parties to independently initiate the organization of social groups of the same nature, so I ordered them to merge.</p>
<p>Social Organizations Must Have a Legitimate Mission</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng also asked: When citizens organize social groups and register with the Social Bureau, why are some approved and some are not approved? The Director replied: At present, there are often groups applying for approval, but after investigation, it is found that many of them use the name to collect huge membership fees from members or arrange fights, so they are not approved. The purpose of statutory organizations should be pure, and they should at least have a special and legitimate mission. Those that are solely for the purpose of maintaining relationships are actually unnecessary.</p>
<p>Zhou Lianze said that the fixed amount of 30,000 yuan for public pawnbroking is too small and should be increased to 200,000 or 300,000. Answer: The establishment of public pawnbroking is to help the common people. Any damaged items are accepted, and nine out of ten are not redeemed. Therefore, funds are limited, and if it is increased too high, the truly poor will not be able to pawn anything.</p>
<h3>Banning Without Aftercare Is Very Troublesome</h3>
<p>Lu Huiming inquired about how to solve the aftercare problem for unemployed dancers after the ban on dance halls by lottery, and Zhang Zhihan also said: The government should carefully consider the austerity plan, otherwise it will cause social unrest. It is unreasonable for the government to regard dancers as floods and beasts. Who doesn't have children? No one prepares their daughters to be dancers when they grow up. The reason for this is out of necessity.</p>
<p>Director Wu's reply to this question said: Senator's proposal said "It is better to regulate dance than to ban dance." I think it is not easy to regulate dance halls strictly. However, the problem of relief for unemployed dancers is very troublesome. At the last municipal meeting, Mayor Wu asked me what to do, and I answered him, "There is no way," only "get married." To put it bluntly, the life of dancers is too extravagant. They are used to eating and wearing well, and the relief center cannot afford to support them, and they cannot live there. So it is better to get married and live a comfortable life.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Jindu Massacre, the Director Once Requested Punishment</h3>
<p>(2) Police Affairs: Zhang Zhihan asked to report on the handling results of the Jindu Massacre. Traffic in this city is chaotic, and tragedies easily occur. Empty tricycles and rickshaws often travel slowly on the road, greatly hindering traffic. It is necessary to strictly ban them. Director Yu replied: The part of the Jindu incident involving military police has been finalized in Nanjing. As for the police part, the criminal part will be tried by the judicial authorities, and the administrative part, the director of the Xincheng Branch, has been demoted. Laoza, Huangpu, and Songshan also had student police officers participating at the time, so the directors of each bureau were given a major demerit. As for myself, I also have dereliction of duty and have requested the mayor to punish me. Empty cars wandering on the road are always urged to pay attention. However, a part of them come from the suburbs and have no customers to pick up when they go back, which inevitably hinders traffic. It is decided to strictly ban them.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan said: Rickshaw and tricycle cushions are sometimes taken away by the police. If they are not returned for a day, it will affect their livelihood for a day. It is necessary to adopt a fine method. The Director replied: I also sympathize with the fact that car cushions are taken away. I have repeatedly ordered my subordinates not to do so, but according to police reports, they have repeatedly violated the rules and will not listen to warnings. There is really no other way.</p>
<h3>Yang Anren: Haggard. Only in Prison for a Dozen Days. No Longer the Heroic Posture of the Past</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Anren, the deputy director of the National Bank Operations Bureau who was sentenced to seven years in prison for the Jinchao case, was brought out from the Sinan Road Detention Center at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yang was mentally depleted, with a pale complexion and dull eyes, wearing an old white canvas suit, a blue turn-down collar shirt, and old yellow leather shoes. He has only been in prison for more than ten days, and he no longer has the heroic posture of the past. He was first escorted to the Grand Court for trial, and then escorted to the Eighth Investigation Court to be interrogated by Prosecutor Chuan Bang about whether he was detained during the trial period, so that it could be deducted from his sentence. Yang replied that he was detained by the Garrison Command for one day when the case occurred, so Yang's sentence for the case is seven years less one day. At 4:30 PM, after the interrogation, he was returned to the detention center. It is said that Yang will be transferred to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for execution within days.</p>
<h3>Dancers Shout Loudly: I Don't Want to Get Married! Another General Meeting Calls for a Postponement of the Dance Ban</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Amid the call to ban dancing, the city's dance hall industry made another appeal. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the second temporary general meeting was held at the New Xianlin Dance Hall. Representatives from 29 dance halls in the city, dancers, musicians, and dance industry workers, totaling about 20,000 people, arrived in large trucks early in the morning. The scene inside and outside New Xianlin once again resembled the crowded scene of the previous time. Nearly 4,000 dancers were still wearing cloth shoes and blue shirts, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, lying down on the lawn in front of New Xianlin, like a group of refugees. They were in stark contrast to the huge, dull neon lights on the roof of New Xianlin, making people feel that prosperity is like a dream.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the leaders of the congress presidium, Sun Hongyuan, Zheng Weixian, Tang Zongjie, Mao Zhihai, etc., delivered speeches one after another, repeatedly stating that dance halls are legitimate businesses and have nothing to do with austerity. If austerity is enough to create unemployment, then the parents, children, and livelihoods of tens of thousands of dance industry workers will also be cut off. Therefore, they called on the authorities that if they really want to limit the time for the lottery to ban dance, they should also give three to five years of sufficient time so that they can find ways to change careers calmly. Subsequently, dancers' representatives Sun Zhimin and Jin Meihong gave speeches. Sun shouted, "We demand the right to continue living!" Jin frequently shouted, "I don't want to get married!" Both were passionate and completely changed their weeping appearance last time. In order to maintain order at the meeting yesterday, the male and female seats were separated on the left and right in advance. There were many old women and children in the female seats, all of whom were family members brought by the dancers. When Jin and Sun gave impassioned speeches, they listened attentively, seemed deeply moved, and some quietly wiped away tears with handkerchiefs.</p>
<h3>Senator's Wonderful Speech: Dancing Can Cure Chilblains</h3>
<p>Hu Yunyuan, representative of the Dance Industry Workers' Union, took the stage and said, "If our demands cannot be realized, we will go to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to cry!" Before he finished speaking, a burst of applause followed. Musician representative Aranas then said in a relaxed tone: "Many foreigners are rushing to Shanghai to visit dance halls because Shanghai dance halls have a special atmosphere. If this atmosphere is eliminated, it will be a great disappointment!" The audience responded with a burst of applause. When Senator Zhu Wende spoke to the point that "Dancing can cure chilblains, and music can relieve boredom. Why should it be banned?", applause and cheers erupted inside and outside, lasting for a long time.</p>
<p>Dispatch Ten Representatives to Petition the Senate</p>
<p>The conference decided to send representatives Sun Hongyuan, Sun Suiren, Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, Xu Tianbing, Chen Yaoting, He Hai, Zheng Zhongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and Aranas to the Senate at 3:00 PM to petition. Senators Wang Xianqing and Tao Baichuan received them on behalf of the Senate. Sun Zhimin presented two letters from the city's dancers to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, totaling 818 letters, and Sun Hongyuan and Aranas expressed their opinions. Wang and Tao agreed to forward them and earnestly urged the representatives to understand the principle of "stability first" and wait patiently for the authorities to give instructions. The authorities will definitely take into account Shanghai's special environment as much as possible and formulate a satisfactory solution. After receiving a definite answer, the representatives left one after another.</p>
<h3>Swift Action to Search for Hoarded Goods, Uncovering a Group Hoarding Fuel, Totaling Thousands of Tons Worth Hundreds of Millions, Requesting the Establishment of Another Review Committee for Verification</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The skyrocketing prices of gasoline, motor oil, and fuel oil in the city were actually caused by a group manipulating hoarding behind the scenes. After Mayor Wu received this report, he immediately sent personnel to investigate secretly and submitted a list of the hoarding oil merchants to the Police Bureau's Economic Section yesterday morning. After Director Xu consulted Director Ruan, he immediately dispatched a large number of officers, divided into 14 groups, and set off to inspect simultaneously. By 6:00 PM, a total of more than a thousand tons of various oils had been inspected, worth about hundreds of millions of yuan. The Yongda Kerosene Factory on Gaoyang Road hoarded 1,000 tons of diesel, 550 cans of kerosene, and 37 barrels.

Shen Bailu at No. 91 Xinjian Road hoarded 126 barrels of diesel and 29 cans of kerosene. The above-mentioned hoarded oils that were seized were sealed and handed over to the parties for safekeeping and reported to the mayor for verification that evening. Director Xu believes that the work of auditing all the seized account books is a major responsibility and has requested the director to set up another review committee for verification, so as to handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Bloodshed Case on Haifang Road Comes to Light: Apprentice Expelled and Takes Revenge</h3>

<h3>Jeep Accident Case: Driver George Interrogated</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Romanian George Barber, driver of the American War Dead Repository in Shanghai, drove a yellow jeep at 0:25 AM on the 21st of this month in front of No. 134 Tongfu Road and knocked down a tricycle, killing the rickshaw puller Wang Zhongxing. The perpetrator driver George was arrested and confessed after interrogation. He was escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, where Prosecutor Liang Shunsheng interrogated him. He also admitted to the crime. Because George is suspected of causing death due to negligence in his work, he was ordered to be detained temporarily.</p>
<p>The Mayor also replied: The traffic in this city is chaotic, and the main roads are too narrow, which has a great impact. The widening of Tianmu Road will be very beneficial, but residents have come to petition again. However, for the benefit of the majority of people, the Municipal Government has to sacrifice the interests of the minority.</p>
<h3>Crazy Gambling in Small Teahouses from New Year's to Now</h3>
<p>Li Shuzi asked the Police Bureau to strictly prohibit gambling, saying that villagers in the suburbs play mahjong and use rice as bets, with some using five dou of rice as one spade, and there is a small teahouse that has never closed at night since the New Year, gambling day and night. The Director replied: Those who gamble in public places will be punished for breaking the law. In August, 47 people were arrested for gambling, and stricter measures will be taken in the future.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan said that prostitutes soliciting customers on the street should be banned and sent to women's homes. Answer: Dealing with the problem of prostitutes is very difficult. Many are arrested every day, but they return to their old ways after being released, which is difficult to deal with. However, we must strengthen our efforts.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuexiang said that the police cars are badly damaged and should be improved immediately. Wang Guoxian said that the fire-fighting equipment is also poor. The Director replied: This is actually limited by maintenance. I hope the Senate will mobilize citizens to donate.</p>

<h3>Carrying Secret Communist Orders: Electricity Workers Arrested; Police Chief Announces Breakthrough in Case</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Regarding the "disappearance" of Zhang Zhongzhi, executive of the Third Branch of the Electricity Workers' Union, and Wu Kewen, head of the Cultural Department, and four others, as reported in various newspapers yesterday, Yu Shuping, the city's police chief, stated that in recent months, numerous reactionary newspapers and periodicals have been discovered in the city, and the police bureau was ordered to suppress them and investigate their printing locations. After a lengthy secret investigation, it was discovered that the Futong Printing House on Weihaiwei Road was the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda organ in Shanghai. On the night of the 19th of this month, personnel were dispatched to search the premises, arresting over twenty CCP members and seizing a large quantity of documents inciting worker and student unrest. Among them were Wu Kewen, Zhang Zhongzhi, Wang Hailin, [character unclear], Lian Yaokun, and Wang Jiaxiong, six individuals in charge of the Electricity Workers' Union who were involved in the work. Several secret orders from the CCP Central Committee were found on Wu Kewen's person. One of them stated: "The CCP ordered Wu and others on September 10 to sabotage the Shanghai Power Company's machinery within a reasonable period, creating a terrifying situation in Shanghai, thereby disrupting social order and confusing people's minds." Wu Kewen and the others are currently under intensive interrogation.</p>
<h3>Petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau Twice: Demanding the Release of Six Workers</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Following the arrest of electricity workers Wu Kewen, Zhang Zhongzhi, and four others, the company's workers sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau at eleven o'clock yesterday morning to petition Director Wu, requesting negotiations for their release. Director Wu stated that if the workers were found to have no political background and the printed publications contained no reactionary content, he would negotiate with the police bureau for their bail. After the representatives returned to the factory, they convened a workers' meeting and expressed dissatisfaction with Director Wu's response. At two o'clock in the afternoon, they gathered over two thousand workers and went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and representatives presented their views. The Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to receive them and give a reply, which the representatives considered unsatisfactory. At that time, Wu Shishen, chairman of the Electricity Workers' Union, and Director Ding Bu and others arrived and continued negotiations, but to no avail. Around seven o'clock, Fan Zhengbang, chief of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, advised the representatives, but the representatives insisted on their original demands and refused to leave. At around eight o'clock, the union directors held a temporary board meeting in the social plaza, deciding on three measures: 1. Appointing three representatives to continue petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau on the 24th. 2. The petitioning workers will return to the factory but will temporarily cease work. 3. Work will only resume after the six arrested workers are released. After the meeting concluded at ten o'clock, the union chairman announced the three measures decided by the temporary board meeting to the crowd, and the petitioning crowd finally left the bureau and returned to the factory.</p>
<h3>Citizen Death, Suspected Infant Mortality: Mayor Frankly Admits He Had Not Paid Attention to Statistics</h3>
<p>Regarding finance: Shi Zongde stated that the collection of the automotive municipal construction donation was not individually notified, only announced publicly, and citizens who did not pay attention were fined for late payment, resulting in significant losses. Director Tian replied: In the future, individual notices will be sent to vehicle owners to pay the donation. However, in reality, the income from fines is limited.</p>
<p>Regarding civil affairs: Wang Weiyin inquired whether the city's household registration survey was accurate, expressing considerable doubt. He noted that the city's population in July of this year was 4,300,630, while the number of deaths was only 2,634, resulting in a mortality rate of only seven per thousand. He pointed out that it is rare for any country's population mortality rate to be below fifteen per thousand and that studies indicate that China's average mortality rate is typically above thirty per thousand. Director Zhang responded: The city's mortality rate is seven per thousand. In 1933, the national rate was eight per thousand. The rates in various countries are also similar: France eight per thousand, the Netherlands also eight per thousand. Population deaths in the city are not subject to mandatory registration, and deaths of young children, etc., are often not reported.</p>
<p>Shi Zongde stated that the reports from the Central Meteorological Observatory are often inaccurate, affecting travel and safety, and requested that the city government pay attention. Mayor Wu replied: I have not paid attention to this matter, I am very ashamed. I often transfer attention to the Academia Sinica, but this matter requires decades of experience and sophisticated technology.

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Sends Letter to Mayor: Abandons Shanghai Election</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, sent letters to Mayor Wu and Chairman Fang yesterday, stating: "Esteemed Guozhen, greetings. In this year's National Assembly election, the public sentiment is fervent. Tiecheng has frequently been urged by comrades and friends in Shanghai to participate in the Shanghai election. They said that the citizens love me and have unanimously recommended me. Their words are earnest, and I am deeply grateful and moved. I have been a Shanghai citizen for over thirty years and have served as a public servant for over five years. Every time I return to Shanghai, it feels like returning to my hometown. When I meet with local people, whether I know them or not, they treat me as one of their own and joyfully reminisce. This deep affection is something Tiecheng will never forget. If I could be elected in Shanghai this time, I would not only be delighted but also consider it the highest honor. Unexpectedly, elders and brothers in Guangdong have sent a flurry of letters and telegrams, urging me to compete in Guangdong, and they have already registered me as a candidate in the original constituency. I dare not disobey the wishes of the elders, and it would be inappropriate to halt their efforts. After repeated consideration, I can only agree to run in Guangdong. Tiecheng is indeed a Shanghai citizen, and in future elections, I will still go to Shanghai to vote, fulfilling my duty as a citizen. However, I deeply regret that I cannot participate in the Shanghai election this time. The kindness and affection of the people of Shanghai towards Tiecheng will be forever etched in my heart. I hope the Mayor will understand. I hereby announce this and extend my respects. Citizen Wu Tiecheng."</p>

<h3>Autumn in Huludao</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper, Shenyang, 18th) The autumn in Huludao appears particularly desolate and lonely; this is the first impression the reporter received. Looking out from the harbor, the vast expanse of water is boundless. There are no chimneys and no sails, only seagulls frolicking there. The three docks are all quiet. A 6,000-ton freighter is docked, having already unloaded ammunition and guns, fully loading three trains. Three or five soldiers are wandering on the dock. One soldier is laboriously catching a small fish. Commercial ships are prohibited from entering here; it only swallows and spits out war materials. There is no smell of money, and no traces of wealthy merchants or ordinary tourists. Judging from the notices posted by the port headquarters, there have been smuggling and black market activities. History has destined Huludao to be lonely. When our government began construction in April of the 19th year of the Republic, the Japanese did everything possible to obstruct it. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese developed Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen), making Huludao look like a ghost guarding the west coast of Liaodong Bay. History has taken a step forward. Today, we must re-evaluate the value of Huludao, and to value the Northeast, we must value this only gateway at present.</p>
<p>There are small hills rising from the sea on the island. To the right of the hills, there is a fishing port that produces a large amount of hair shrimp. The reporter crossed over the back of the hill, and a scene from "Song of the Fishermen" unfolded before his eyes. Going down the slope to the fishing village, this village has 180 households, about 1,200 people, all relying on hair shrimp for a living. The total annual income reaches 240 billion yuan (circulation currency). 60% of the income is in the hands of a few shipowners. The fishermen work hard but cannot get enough to eat. A fishing boat hires four fishermen. For every ten catties of fish caught, the shipowner gets six catties, and each fisherman can only get one catty of fish. The highest annual income for a fisherman is 600,000 yuan, and the lowest is 200,000 yuan, which is not enough to eat sorghum rice and corn. The faces of the fisherman do not have the color of a sailor; they have been eroded by hunger. In this corner of the island, the vast majority of good people are living a life of humiliation and poverty. The cause of social instability may lie here.</p>
<p>When leaving this small island, I looked out at the harbor; the sea breeze howled, and the waves surged. It was the sight of the autumn tide coming in! (Reporter Zhao Zhan) The second dock of Huludao Port (Northeast News Agency photo)</p>

<p>"After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to develop the Northwest and consolidate the frontier defense, in November of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Jiang ordered Chairman Ma Bufang to oversee the construction of the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway. The Engineering Office was formally established on April 1, 35, and actively prepared. On April 28, it set out to survey, and at the same time, employees, soldiers, and migrant workers from various sections went to the construction site one after another and started work in turn. In the 35th year, from Daotang River to Nutule, a total of ten sections were divided, mobilizing more than 8,000 soldiers to work.

Then, Miss Bao Yinglan and Miss Song Yanshou cut the ribbon, and Miss Zhang Peimei cut the ribbon. With a bang, the curtain of the new highway test run was slowly opened. The cheers that filled the sky were mixed with the sound of firecrackers and the roar of the motors of the five trucks. At this time, the hands of the clock were pointing to 8:42. When the pleasure-seekers in the metropolis were just lightly stepping into the land of dreams, these five trucks had braved the slight chill of the new autumn and set off on the vast and flat Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway, heading towards the Koko Nor prairie, completing an unprecedented and enthusiastic test run ceremony.

Regarding schools that are striving tirelessly despite economic difficulties, I cited Fudan and Nankai as examples, but I did not list these two schools as being the foremost. I am currently in charge of Fudan's affairs and cannot proclaim it as number one, as that would be boastful.

<h3>University Sports Meet to be Held on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>The university sports meet, organized by the Municipal Sports Field, which was postponed twice last semester due to rain and student unrest, has now been decided to be rescheduled for Double Tenth Day. Because the various prizes have already been prepared, the invitation nature of the previous semester has been cancelled. All public and private universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools in this city can register to participate as a school unit. The meet is divided into male and female groups, and the events remain the same. The registration period is from October 1st to 5th. The procedures will be announced in the coming days and will be sent separately to each school. According to the person in charge of the sports field, if the open sports meet scheduled by the Sports Association to be held on the same day is not cancelled due to the rescheduling of the city-wide sports meet, then it will still be combined with the university sports meet at the sports field to save costs.</p>
<h3>Open Tennis Tournament in Full Swing; Semi-Finals Intense and Tense</h3>

<h3>Night Scene at the Lido; Record of the Opening of Xiangdao Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Correspondent] Autumn has cooled, and the Lido's opening at this time is indeed somewhat out of season, but given the lack of swimming pools these days, and the appearance it presents after the renovation, it is already a "Lido Garden." I think there will still be many attractive aspects.</p>
<p>The Lido was requisitioned by the Air Force last year and was only recently returned. After some refurbishment, it has a unique flavor. Its swimming pool facilities are not much different from the "Continent" in Shanghai, but the diving platform is more complete than the "Continent." Moreover, the Lido faces the sea in the back, with some slight natural charm, and is not "vulgar." What is even more exciting is the open-air dance floor.</p>
<p>On the green grass, tables and chairs are arranged. There is intoxicating music, fine wine, and you can also enjoy a cup of deep-flavored coffee. The sea breeze blows, the seductive lights, and the charming moonlight create a great place! On Mid-Autumn Festival night, as long as there is no rain, there will be no shortage of guests here.</p>
<p>Due to the rain, the Lido's "ribbon-cutting" opening was postponed to the 7th. After 5:00 PM, the eastbound "Qingjivan" tram was very crowded, and many people went to the "Lido" to join the fun. Guo Quan, Weng Shijian, Cao Ke'an, and prominent figures in the business community also came to "Lido" to support the event, which was a rare sight. How could the tables and chairs on the green lawn accommodate more than 5,000 spectators.</p>
<p>The swimming performance began at 6:00 PM. The exciting programs included: screw turn swim, synchronized swimming, driving in reverse swim, burlap sack swim... There were also diving and water polo performances. The performers included: Chen Lvji, Mai Weiming, Wang Xiushan, Luo Dezhen, and other famous swimmers. At 8:00 PM, the order was the ribbon-cutting of the dance floor. The ceremony was performed by four sisters: Xi Qiuxia, Chen Qi, Zhang Fan, and Chen Juanjuan. We composed poetry in the cool autumn night by the sea and left.</p>
<h3>Billiards Competition for Student Aid; Datong Cup Handicap Tournament; More Than Forty Participants</h3>

<h3>Four-Party Joint Office's Rotating Audit Team Completes Work in Shanghai Region</h3>
<p>Submitted General Report on Top Ten Industries</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The four-party joint office’s rotating audit team’s work in the Shanghai region, lasting more than two months, was fully completed on the 20th of this month. The team inspected 102 factories, including dyeing and weaving, flour, oil pressing, electrical machinery, chemical industry, and other production industries. Most of the larger-scale loan factories in the city have been inspected. This audit work did not focus on trivial details but mainly sought to understand the facts to clarify the actual situation of each production industry and the effectiveness after the loans. Therefore, the work was more arduous than previous audits. In addition to compiling audit reports for each factory inspected, the team collected data from relevant agencies to verify the information. A general report has also been submitted on the top ten major industries, including weaving, silk weaving, wool weaving, flour, oil pressing, electrical machinery, machinery, enamel, rubber, and western medicine, to provide reference for the authorities in deciding future review and loan policies. According to the results of the inspection, the situation is generally as follows: Generally, the use of loans is still normal, and no cases of using loans for non-production purposes have been found. Due to the continuous rise in raw material prices, there is a widespread feeling of difficulty in circulating funds, and using the loans to purchase materials is far better than other uses. Most manufacturers have seen a significant increase in production and sales volume after receiving loans. However, some have not reached their maximum production capacity due to a lack of raw materials, insufficient power, and labor disputes. The accounting systems of various factories are mostly unsound. Some still cling to old habits, using old-style accounting subjects, which are unclear and should be improved.</p>

<h3>National Textile Industry Production Conference to Open in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Textile Industry Production Conference, hosted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, is scheduled to be held at the City Chamber of Commerce from 9:00 AM tomorrow for three days. Chen Qitian will come to Shanghai to personally preside over the conference. The General Assembly has established a secretariat, with Liu Wenteng as Secretary-General and Yuan Shenda as Deputy.

<h3>Civil Coal Allocation Method: Fuel Management Committee to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The sixth meeting of the Civil Coal Allocation Committee of the Fuel Management Committee is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 5th. At that time, the allocation method for the fourth allocation of civil coal in the city will be decided. It is reported that the total amount of the fourth allocation of coal will still be 15,000 tons. As for the third civil coal allocation of over 13,000 tons, 80-90% has already been allocated. The investigation sub-committee of the Allocation Committee also held a meeting on the 20th to further adjust the A, B, C, D, and E grades of the original 44 coal allocation industries.</p>
<p>Recently, black market coal prices have fluctuated, with bituminous coal reaching 3 million per ton, more than three times the official price. The reasons for the analysis are: 1. General price increases. 2. Diesel fuel has already risen threefold, and more and more people are switching to coal. 3. The situation in Hankou is unstable, and the source of Xiang coal is blocked. Therefore, coal prices have gradually risen. However, the Fuel Management Committee's source of coal is increasing daily. However, in order to replenish the safe coal reserves, the allocation amount has not been fully increased. However, it is firmly believed that if the allocation of coal is not delayed, coal prices can be gradually brought into line. It is reported that recently, various coal mines in Kaihua and other places have sent letters requesting adjustments to the price of coal. The reasons are: 1. Since the exchange rate has been changed to be pegged to the market price, costs have increased drastically. 2. Wages have generally increased. At the current price of coal, it is impossible to continue production. The Committee is currently considering the situation.</p>
<p>Factories Requesting Coal Briquettes Strictly Prohibited from Flowing into the Black Market</p>
<p>[Our Report] The market price of coal briquettes has risen to 85,000 per dan, while the price for industrial workers is still 28,000 per dan, a huge difference. Therefore, various factories are enthusiastically applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for allocation. In order to prevent malfeasance and flow into the black market, the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday invited the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, and the Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association to discuss and decide to continue issuing goods to the approved coal briquette factories as much as possible. If it is found that coal briquettes are flowing into the black market, the allocation rights of the factory will be immediately terminated. Participants also calculated the source of coal dust in the country this year. According to Shanghai's fuel consumption, there is still a shortage of 200 tons of coal dust this year. Foreign exchange needs to be used to purchase from abroad to Shanghai. The Central Trust and the Central Bank are requested to find ways to provide this foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Qinhuangdao Coal Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Tian ship is transporting 8,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The Hai Yan ship is also transporting 2,400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the same time tomorrow (the 25th).</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Balancing is Effective, Overseas Remittances are Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, an official from the Foreign Exchange Balancing Fund Committee told reporters: The biggest goal of the Committee in balancing foreign exchange is to make the exchange rate closer to reality, in order to promote exports and increase overseas remittances. He said: Since the establishment of the Committee, up to the 18th of this month, general prices have risen by 40%, export commodity prices have risen by about 9%, and the foreign exchange rate has risen by about 9%. Comparing this, the impact of general prices on export goods and the foreign exchange rate is very clear. However, the Balancing Committee still hopes to maximize the balance of the exchange rate under the premise of taking into account the actual situation. It is reported that China's export situation has been better than expected in the past month, and overseas remittances are gradually becoming normal. In the future, the strategy of balancing the exchange rate will be used to make exports and overseas remittances better day by day.</p>

<h3>Overseas Compatriot Seeks Brother from Afar (Translated)</h3>
<p>Remote mountains and rivers, who grieves for the lost traveler?</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a Chinese living in Nanyang since childhood. I know very little about the language of my motherland, which is the main reason why I am writing this letter in English today. I have an older brother named Luo Hong. Two years before the War of Resistance, he returned to the motherland to pursue higher education. After graduating from Chaoyang University, I received a letter from him, knowing that he had joined the army to participate in the War of Resistance. Since then, I have not heard from him. It has been ten years now, and I don't know if he is still alive. My mother passed away a year ago, and I am also in dire straits. I hope you can publish this letter in the newspaper. If it can give us brothers a chance to reunite, we will never forget it. Sincerely wishing you peace, Reader Kesawan Medan</p>

<h3>Zhang Shuqi's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>Brother Shuqi has returned from America with honors, and he is exhibiting his recent works at the China Painting Academy, which is a major event in the art world. I have seen his large paintings, the brushstrokes are fluent, the ink colors are blended, and the spirit is complete. The hooks and carvings are particularly strong, directly approaching the Song people, sweeping away the weak habit of recent drawings. Occasionally, the use of dyed paper adds to the clarity; the charm of setting it off is deepened. The landscapes are unprecedented, among which the autumn trees are swaying and graceful, and the atmosphere is stern, with the general idea of Qu Yuan's "The wind soughs and the trees rustle," which is the crown of the whole scene. Several willows are sparse and well-arranged, embellishing the foot of the slope and the mouth of the water, especially giving a sense of leisure and distance. More than half of the colorers are mostly unconventional, and they are ingenious. Because the United States has been wantonly buying European ancient and modern paintings in the past ten years, the richness of the collection is almost no less than that of France, Italy, Belgium, and England. Brother Shuqi has lived there for a long time, watching and learning day and night, and has a special understanding. Then he unconsciously revealed it on paper.</p>
<h3>Zhu Yingpeng's World Art View</h3>
<p>— Wu Ti</p>
<p>The appreciation of all modeling arts usually goes through a process from "eye appreciation" to "heart appreciation." The former is physiological, while the latter is psychological and ideological.</p>
<p>Before this exhibition of Chinese paintings by Mr. Zhu Beihai (Yingpeng), I had read it once. Let's take the Guanyin in the form of a general who is now pointed out. At a glance, the most striking thing is the thin and sharp line that is very slow, calm and clear; secondly, the direction and ups and downs of the money, free change, free occurrence, although extremely neat and extremely smooth pleasure; again, the moist and transparent, light and even ironing color, as if the air in early spring, refreshing. In this way, after the physiological movement evoked by the screen reaches an appropriate stage, the rational concept makes me pay attention to the theme of the depiction. The compassionate female Guanyin Bodhisattva has been transformed into a mighty general, which is exactly "I am in front of him, all showing his body, and showing his body, and for saying the law, making him accomplished" originating from the story of the Buddhist scriptures. Looking at the expression, the idol posture of the Buddha and Bodhisattva is completely gone, and a superhuman expression of unity of spirit and flesh overflows the paper and ink. Its realm is the realm of the heavens. His figure painting method contains the qualities of Greek, Indian, and various arts after the European Renaissance in the inherent style of China. The charm is vivid, brilliant and magnificent. The enthusiasm is seen in the implication, full of the power of life. From the understanding caused by the book, I feel that there are two main factors in the artistic content of the Zhu style: in thought, it is the union of the two trends of being born and living in the world; in art, it is the integration of the two forces of national character and internationality.</p>
<p>Like Zhu Shi's unique form, magnificent and strange painting style, it is certainly wrong to say that he deliberately perverted. In fact, things that have no source will never cause new emotion and shudder for the appreciator. The formation of the style of all works of art is determined by the artist's personality, and the artist's personality is determined by his thoughts and his philosophical basis. Zhu Shi's works are displayed in the Chinese Art Academy, and everyone can appreciate it, because of this. I personally rely on subjective reasoning, no longer the metaphysical side, but the metaphysical side.</p>
<p>The paintings exhibited this time are all Zhu Shi's recent productions. Although they are not final editions, they are already mature fruits, needless to say. For more than 20 years, from the life of the party and government to social life, to the lonely life after the enemy and puppets occupied Shanghai until today, from the outside, but his art history and nationalist thought have converged into a spirit. Due to years of entrusting his feelings to epic poems, he turned to studying the process of Greek art from West to East, and even involved the religious myths representing the national ideology. Therefore, in this Chinese painting exhibition, we felt a new force, vaguely having the potential to disturb the Chinese literary world.</p>
<p>Judging paintings from paintings, the modern painting style of "imitating as creation" has also reached a time when it must be changed. The personal freehand works of the literati have become empty and without content. What should be replaced is the romantic spirit and the realistic national painter. Like Zhu Shi, the few landscape paintings in his exhibition are all full of strong epic atmosphere. An ideal natural state, and the small world of leisurely and comfortable escape from reality since the Southern Song Dynasty are different.</p>
<h3>Yingpeng's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>The first condition for a calligrapher and painter is to have their own original personality. Since one has a distinct personality, they will naturally go on the road of creation. For example, Yan Lugong's calligraphy has its own personality, and he created the "Yan Zi", which has become a major school of calligraphy. Painters such as Wang Wei, Liang Kai, Mi Fu, Bada, Si Wang, Jin Dongxin, Jiao Bingzhen, etc., are all masters with the strongest personalities and can create.</p>

<h3>Preface to Farewell to Mr. Gu Yiqiao</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zengtai</p>
<p>On September 1, Ding Hai, the Shanghai Municipal Primary School Principals' Talk Association publicly feasted Mr. Gu Yiqiao, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, at the Central Western Restaurant. Because Mr. resigned as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and was honorably appointed as the President of the National Chengchi University: the Chengchi University has the celebration of obtaining a wise president; and the achievements of Mr. in revitalizing Shanghai's education in the past two years, and the unfinished implementation of Shanghai's five-year education plan, all of us colleagues do not want Mr. to leave Shanghai for a day.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of culture in our Republic of China, and the number of universities and primary and secondary schools is the first in the country. Unfortunately, on August 13, 1937, Japanese soldiers invaded, and almost 80-90% of all schools and cultural institutions were destroyed by the enemy. After the victory, Mr. first served as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, and in the midst of extreme economic difficulties, he worked tirelessly, ran around, and reported in order to seek revitalization. In less than two years, almost all of the original municipal schools have been restored; and the newly established municipal schools have increased by more than half compared to before, and the number of students has almost doubled. He has made every effort to run people's education and eliminate illiteracy. Mr.'s achievements in revitalizing Shanghai's education in the past two years are obvious to everyone and will never be erased. In addition, in recent times, prices have risen daily, and life has become increasingly difficult. In addition to raising the basic salary of teachers, Mr. also requested the municipal government to issue academic training fees to teachers, which is helpful to the life of teachers. This Mr. has helped the teachers of our municipal schools, and it is also something that our colleagues will never forget. Now, at the time of parting, recalling Mr.'s achievements in revitalizing Shanghai's education, and understanding the life of teachers in municipal schools, how can we not think leisurely and sad! However, Mr. is honorably appointed to the National Chengchi University. The achievements of his future career and the respect for his reputation will be ten times or a hundred times greater than today in Shanghai, which is even more admirable!</p>
<p>I have not been in contact with Mr. for a day except for official business. Now that the rivers are long and the roads are long, I respectfully say the above.</p>
<h3>Rejoicing in Seeing the Transformation of Guanyin</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The time arrived for White Dew, and after several showers of rain, the heat dissipated instantly. Taking advantage of the cool weather, going to the home of my friend Zhu Beihai (Yingpeng) to read books is indeed an interesting thing.</p>
<p>It was a delicate living room, and what attracted my attention the most was the "green gauze cage." I mean the three bookshelves with gauze screens alone, like wardrobes, with copper rods installed at the top and bottom, which could not only prevent sun and wind, and dust accumulation, but also felt very neat. On the easel were plaster statues of Homer and figures from Greek mythology. Opposite hung an oil painting painted by Beihai himself, next to a copper piano, stacked with many musical scores, and a statue of Beethoven. This was probably the "hobby" of his daughter, Mingwu. Hanging on the wall of the suite was a large oil painting by his disciple Su Xian, Apollo driving a cloud chariot. Just by looking at this art-filled living room, one can tell what kind of person the host is, and there is no need to introduce him further.</p>
<p>I woke Beihai from his afternoon nap. He showed me many of his recent works. Soon, He Tianjian, Yu Jianhua, Wang Jinshan, and other painting friends also arrived, as well as Chen Shihua and Shen Lizhi, and the two Xizongs. We appreciated Beihai's works together, while casually discussing the major trends in the painting world over the past decade.</p>
<p>Beihai's paintings are roughly divided into two categories: landscapes and figures. Land scenes like "Cloud Plank Picture," "Three Pines Picture," "Lofty Peaks and Autumn Freshness," and the imagined "Mount Hua," although they are also creations with clouds leaning on them, do not feel very fresh and do not evoke special feelings. Perhaps I am just making a fuss over nothing? Whenever I see paintings of the sea or snow-covered sea, I always think this way, as I have never seen similar paintings before. Such as "Breaking Waves," "Heavenly Sun Driving," "Sunset Surprising Waves," "Watching the Sea Picture," "Sea Tide," the colors are light and extremely quiet, shedding the worldly atmosphere and reaching a state of perfection. His material from the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" suits the taste of a mythology enthusiast like me even more. To put it bluntly, I seem to see the woodcuts inserted in "Selected Yuan Dramas."</p>
<p>The figures are even better than the landscapes. Such as "Dragon Girl Offering Pearl," "Red Line Stolen Box" (I hope to see a copy, a lonely female knight of Ling Kang without the green sides above and below). "A Country Girl Holding a Hoe," "Auspicious Goddess," "Beihai Miao Gu Immortal," and other works are certainly very pleasing; but what I like the most are the various transformations of Guanyin. The five colors are dazzling, making people unable to take it all in. The author himself likes "Guanyin Appearing as a General" the most, wearing helmet and armor, with full and powerful muscles, and especially bright and divine eyes. Accompanied by little ghosts, riding clouds and controlling the air, it feels even more solemn. In addition, there are "Standing Guanyin," "Sitting Guanyin" (one of which is uncolored), "Gauze Robe Guanyin," "Elephant-Riding Guanyin," "Ruyi Guanyin," "Open-Eyed Guanyin," "Willow Branch Sprinkling Water Guanyin," "Sudhana Guanyin," "Long Sword Guanyin," etc. I love to see "Sleeping Guanyin" and "Fish Basket Guanyin" the most. The Sleeping Guanyin closes her eyes and lowers her eyebrows, leaning on a rock, making her even more beautiful. The halo on her head almost becomes a moon gate in a garden, covering her whole body. The Fish Basket Guanyin leans her body diagonally, her left hand holding her skirt, her right hand holding a basket, with a lively and fresh fish inside, as if performing the Kunqu opera "Following the Boat." Beihai paints Guanyin using extremely thin and easily滲透半生料級畫紙, very meticulous, the area occupied by the painting is very small, only about one-tenth of the entire picture, leaving a square at the top for inscription or appraisal. Sometimes the clouds are winding, quite like a pattern, I can shrink it to make the cover of a literary book. I have read "Buddhist Birth Stories" by Rhys Davids of England, and I know that Sakyamuni would be reborn as a farmer, doctor, judge, etc., many times. Unexpectedly, Guanyin also has so many transformations. The author mentioned that he loves Guanyin, and especially likes her pair of bare feet; Jinshan added "bare chest and exposed breasts," and I added: "This is close to the power and beauty of Greece." In the past, Chinese paintings of Guanyin often had her sitting on a lotus seat, hiding her natural feet. Probably such paintings are imported into China from India after being influenced by Chinese etiquette. Beihai, like the "Heavenly Horse" he painted himself, is unconstrained, so what he paints is very different from the traditional method. He is not Zhao Mengfu or Li Gonglin, but himself. He has his own unique style, especially the various transformations of Guanyin he paints.</p>
<p>Walking out with Jinshan, in front of my eyes still appear Guanyin holding a willow branch, a long sword, a ruyi, or a fish basket, either sitting or standing or lying down, accompanied by little ghosts or Sudhana, the various images, very different from the clay sculptures made by craftsmen in the back hall of ancient temples. I am drunkenly as if I have appreciated a new hand scroll of Guanyin paintings in the Dunhuang Grottoes.</p>
<p>Most painters and calligraphers will imitate and follow, and at best, they can only become fake Dong Xin, fake Four Wangs, fake Bada, etc., which is not worth mentioning!</p>
<p>Like Jiao Bingzhen, who absorbed the essence of Western art and applied it to Chinese paintings, making Chinese paintings more perfect and radiant, it is naturally worthy of praise. This kind of work of absorbing the essence of Western art is becoming more and more wonderful in modern times. We dare say that when studying contemporary Chinese painting in the future, we will definitely discover many characteristics that the predecessors dared not try. Chinese painting in modern times is not a golden age, but at least it is not far from the golden age.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yingpeng is an outstanding figure in modern Chinese painting. His personality is the strongest. People say that he is very difficult to deal with. In daily affairs, Mr. Zhu himself indeed feels difficult to deal with, but in art, it is precisely the main factor of Mr. Zhu's success. In other words, Mr. Zhu's paintings have his own consistent personality and never follow others, but he can grasp and apply the advantages of his predecessors. In addition, he is also very knowledgeable in Western painting, so he can also grasp the characteristics of Western painting. The excellence of the lines in figure painting is the result of his integration of the strengths of ancient and modern painting schools. For example, for the study of clothing pleats, he spared no effort, spending a lot of effort in Buddhist art to search, and then seeking clues from ancient Greek art. So he created the most perfect modern Chinese figure painting.</p>
<p>He can also paint landscapes and flowers to the best of his ability, depicting them to the most touching point. Even for a small stone, the ink color he uses must integrate the folds of Chinese painting and the shading of Western painting. His works can be said to be masterpieces, so although the size is not large, it is enough for people to appreciate. For those who truly love art, we hope to be able to appreciate Mr. Zhu's works more.</p>
