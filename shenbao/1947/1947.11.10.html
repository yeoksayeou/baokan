<h3>馬卿向兩院外委會報吿　美國援華數字估計　下年度可動用十億美元</h3>
<p>﹝聯合社華戚頓八日電﹞馬歇爾國務卿將於十日向參。衆兩院外交委員會報吿對華（可能包括其他區域）援助需要之估計，以及對歐援助。若干消息靈通之要人稱：中國在下年度可動用價値約十億美元之美國援助，但援助之範圍尙未最後定奪，惟美國已到達最小援助之終點，並正積極設法支援中國，防止經濟崩潰，共產黨軍事壓迫及政治分裂，則無疑義。參院外交委員會主席范登堡數星期前曾勸吿政府，最近並重申前見，謂政府不僅應以其對歐需要之援助估計報吿國會，且須報吿援助總額之數字，以便有利的準備推廣美國在世界其他部份之利益。世界其他部份需要美國援助者，僅有遠東。國務院曾硏究遠東問題，因其不僅與中國有關，且與中國。朝鮮。日本。菲律濱暨該區其他各國問之經濟利益一致。該區之並不如歐洲之密切連結，但全區倘能成立共同諒解，若干問題可以緩和。馬歇爾十日之主要任務，將討論法。義兩國之緊急需要及其對歐洲長期復興之關係。預料其對中國問題僅在大體上論列，馬卿擬重申政府之理論，即復典歐洲，可促世界貿易復活，與世界其他部份包括遠東在內，大有裨益，但此舉對遠東之援助，不若對其他大部份區域之切實。於此，馬歇爾將提及美國之對華援助問題，美除供應若干救濟品，移讓若千戰爭剩餘物資及供給中國陸軍步槍有限的彈藥外，鮮有作爲。國務部當局在估計中國需要時遭遇的難題之一，即中國太無組織，只有比較有限數目的款項，可用於該區的救濟。</p>

<h3>蘇聯故意藐視中國！</h3>
<p>英美蘇法四强外長代表日來在倫敦舉行會議，開始討論對德利約問題。英美法三國代表一致主張，應邀請中國參加起草對德和約的工作，至將來召開對德和會時，中國亦應與四强同爲邀請國之一；詎意蘇聯代表史密爾諾夫於本月八日的會議中，竟獨持異議，以中國非德國降　簽字國爲理由，拒絕英美法三國代表的建議，使四强外畏代表會議遭受挫折。這雖是蘇聯外交家的「重彈舊調」，但在中國王外長力主蘇聯應參加對日和約並堅決反對美國「將蘇聯除外」之說的時候，蘇聯偏偏要反對中國參加起草對德和約的工作，不知我們的外交當局究將作何感想？而蘇聯這種損人不利己的行爲，徒然引起中蘇兩國人民之間的不渝快，對於蘇聯究竟有什麽好處，也實在令人大惑不解。</p>
<p>第一，在現行國際關係之下，世界和平是不可分割的。蘇聯外交家在第二次大戰之前，早已高唱和平不可分割的論調，且獲得各國人民的喝彩；時至今日，第二次大戰結束以後，國際間的動盪更是息息相關，美國的孤立派也早成了時代的落伍者，不復有人相信光榮孤立的謬論了。所以在戰後締造和平，是世界各國共有的任務，尤其是五强，對於世界和平的締造與維持，均負有特殊的責任。但戰後締造和平最重要的工作，乃在起草對德對日兩種和約，這兩種和約的簽訂，有關全世界人類的命運，不能不特別愼重將事。所以在一九四五年八月英美蘇三巨頭在波茨坦舉行會議時，就決定由中，英，美，蘇，法五强，組織一種「外長會議」，負責起草對德國暨其附庸各國之和約；後來英美蘇三國外長在莫斯科開會時，對於起草和約問題，英美外長雖遷就蘇聯，決定此項和約改由英美法蘇四國外長代表起草，但是討論此項和約的和平會議，仍應由中，英，美，法，蘇五國組織之「外長會議」召集。從法理上講，中國應爲對德和會的邀請國，可說是毫無疑義的。再就實際情形而論，中國在這次大戰中，雖格於地理環境，未能直接參加歐洲戰區，與納粹德國及其附庸作戰，但是始終牽制了德國在遠東的盟國日本，使其泥足深陷於中國，不能對德國作有效的援助，不能不說是中國艱鉅的貢獻。尤其是蘇聯，在德蘇戰爭中，所以未受到兩面夾攻的痛苦，更不能不知道這是中國對日抗戰的力量。這一事實，我們相信蘇聯的政治外交家，只要不是挾有偏見，也未嘗不知中國之在遠東抗日，就等於在隊洲協助蘇聯以抗德。但何以今天，蘇聯代表竟拒絕其盟國中國參加對德和約的起草工作，並否認其爲邀請國的資格呢？而我們的王外長，却一定要表示與美國不同的見解，確認對日本只打五六天仗的蘇聯必須參加對日和約，何蘇聯之倨而中國之恭至於如此！</p>
<p>第二，戰後中國當局的外交政策，無往而不爭取蘇聯的友好，甚至不惜任何代價，與蘇聯締結盟約；就是在任何國際會議中，中國的代表也一貫的採取不偏不倚的政策，遇有美蘇代表爭論不下的時候，我國代表也從來不敢有片言隻語得罪了蘇聯，且反而常以調人自居，希圖排難解紛。例如美蘇在聯合國大會中爲了否決權的問題，發生了極大的爭執，中國代表一再提出折衷方案，調和雙方的意見，企岡獲致協議。再如在遠東委員會中，美蘇對於朝鮮問題，也常常發生爭論，中國代表終想做美蘇間的橋標，以溝通雙方的意見，不致使會議陷於僵局。這些事實，不勝枚舉；即在今日，我國對蘇聯的態度，仍非常明顯，只要蘇聯能够忠實履行　蘇盟約所規定的義務，我國終是極願與蘇聯友好的二絕無絲毫成見和芥帝。然而，蘇聯之所以答覆中國者是什麽？</p>
<p>第三，蘇聯在國際會議中，常常輕視我國的國際地位，並企圖將我國　除於邀請國外，已發生過許多次的爭執。例如：去年七月間四國外長在巴黎開會，決定召開歐洲廿一國和會時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾强辭奪理，反對中國爲廿一國和會的邀請國。蘇聯這種不友好而跡近侮辱的舉動，雖使每一個有目尊心的中國人憤慨，但是我國外交當局，始終懦弱畏意，不僅沒有向蘇聯提出抗議，而且在國際會議，仍採取一貫的含垢忍辱的作風。這種畏蘇媚蘇的態度，不但使蘇聯更瞧不起中國，且將使其他盟邦爲之竊笑齒冷。例如召開對日和會問題，美國一再表示擬將蘇聯摒棄在外，單獨召開對日和會，但是我國反堅決反對沒有蘇聯參加的對日媾和的任何建議。我們的王外長，並曾在美國率爾表示：「如蘇聯政府拒絕參加美國所提議之對日和約初步會議，則中國將對此事重予考慮其立塲。」不知道王外長這樣為蘇聯爭取在對日和會中的地位，能否博得蘇聯的歡心，也為中國在國際壇玷上稍留餘地？</p>
<p>第四，戰後的世界，因為美蘇的不能携手合作，共同缔造世界和平，業已造成兩大集團對立的局勢；尤其自新共產國際出現之後，兩大集團之問的鴻溝，愈演愈深了。一方面已揭起反帝的旗幟，號召歐洲各國破壞美國的援歐計劃；另一方則以反共相號召，積極援助他國抵抗外來勢力的侵入。同時在美蘇之間刻正進行中的「冷戰」，也愈演愈烈，蘇聯代表動輒以「戰爭販子」加諸於美國外交家。其在美國也以和平締造不成的責任，歸諸於蘇聯。可憐！站在第三者的中國，對於美蘇的爭論，原不欲有所偏袒，但是蘇聯的外交作風，偏偏特別對中國示威。中國越退讓，蘇聯越傲慢。蘇聯是否眞正愛好世界和平，不能不使我們大大的懷疑了。而在我們願意與蘇聯爲友的人們，對這些一幕一幕的事實表演，也不能不表示憤慨！</p>

<h3>獨步國內的陜省棉產（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報西安航信·特派記者胡隆昶</p>
<p>在陜西省的經濟上，棉產佔了嚴重要的一環，陜省豐厚的棉產，不獨充實了陜省本身潛在的經濟能力，中國唯一橫貫東西的大動脈——隴海鐵路，以及沿綫的大小縣市，也是以運棉起家，談起大宗而品種純正的棉產，陜棉實在已獨步國内，</p>
<p>一般而論，陜省地質高燥，土壤肥沃，氣溫適度，雨量適中，道些優越的自然條件，再加後天人力的提倡，充份推廣改良棉種，才能獲有今日的成績。據統計，陜省棉田面積，從廿三年起，到廿八年止，一個階段裏，面積都在三四百萬畝之間，皮棉產額在一百萬市　左右，戰爭把　出的面積和皮棉的產量都打了個對扣，到去年起，經過不斷的努力，棉田面積又擴充到二·三七〇·〇〇〇畝，皮棉產額擴充到七一一·〇〇〇市祖，本年更　關了，照農林部棉產改進處第二次的佔計報吿，棉田面積已擴充到三百萬畝，皮棉預期的產額是八十八萬市担，已經緊逼着戰前全盛時代的數字了。</p>
<p>陜省的棉產，現在錢乎全部都是美棉的改良種了，改良種裏，主要的是陜南區的脫字棉，和關巾一帶的斯字棉，推廣的比例，前者佔百分之十，播植面積佔卅萬畝，從者佔百分之九十，播植面積佔二百七十萬畝，這些棉種的特點，絲毛細長，大多在一吋以上，質地純正，適合精紡卅二支以上的細紗。</p>
<p>陜省主要的棉產區有四：　　渭區，　省東區，　省西區，　省中區。陜省植棉的自然環增，樣樣都好，就是缺水，此中的涇渭區，因爲受了涇水渭水適度的　溉，產量已佔了全省產棉總額三分之一，這區包括涇陽·三原，高陵三縣，省東區包括渭南·臨　·華縣·郃　·朝邑·大葱等縣，省西區包括咸陽·　縣等縣·省中區集中西安一帶，產量也都不弱。</p>
<p>記者會實地到產棉農　的涇渭渠區裏看棉花，這時候雖說棉花已收了八成，可是遠遠的望去，棉田還是千頃萬頃，綿延不斷。這裏的棉花，因得了　度的水份，株桿的高度，和枝葉的疏密，滋長，恰到好處，所以結出來的棉鈴，旣大又多，普通的棉花，每株可以摘取的棉　都在二十顆上下。陜西省棉產改進處現在正積極把斯字棉種再加改良，每株可摘取的棉鈴數已在三十顆以上，這種再改良的棉種，他們給它起了一個國粹的題名，稱之為涇字棉。</p>
<p>論起陜省今日棉產的成績，在後天的栽培上，大家都推崇二位李先生，一位是已故世的水利專家李儀社先生，他在涇渭區築成了個水閘，把涇水渭水灌溉到棉田裏，以前涇渭區義是土　的一片，至今已滿目一片靑翠了。另一位是李國楨先生，現任陜西棉產改進所兼農林部棉產改進處西安分處處長，陜西的棉農兒他為「棉花菩薩」，他在民十九年畢業於中大農科後，就隨李儀社光生回陜，主辦省立農棉試騐塲，開始作脫字棉的推廣，與運銷合作社的組織，廿五年起，到美國台省加省等農科大學，硏究棉業三年，回陜後繼續為故鄕棉花的增產運動努力，先後從事棉業改進工作已達十五年，在陜省棉產改進推廣史上，李先生是功不可沒的。李先生樸質忠厚，見了記者就一再解釋一般棉花巿塲的錯誤觀念，把上好的陜西　陽花衣，一概　之為　　花，其　　實在豫西，現在交通早已屢絕，許久沒花運出來，他叮囑記者，無論無何得提筆更正一番。</p>

<h3>暹軍人突起政變　總理被俘斐鵬元帥秉政　中美英三國持中立態度</h3>
<p>〔路透社曼谷九日電〕斐鵬元帥（一譯鑾披汶）統率之暹羅陸軍，今晨發動武裝政變，業巳接收暹政府之控制種。斐鵬隨即發表吿人民書，聲言將召回幹練行政官員服務，國家之缺點將迅速予以更正。斐鵬尤其籌請邊境之中國人，保持鎭定，勿得滋事，請彼等及其他人民照常生活及執業。斐鵬部下之軍隊刻已控制所有在曼谷之運輸交通設備及廣播電台。中英美駐曼谷之外交代表於政變發動前一小時，即獲即將發動之通知，三國外交代表於事變時，完全保持中立之態度。曼谷市之交通至晚已完全恢復正常，惟軍略要地則被封鎖，而街頭聚集之人民亦較往日爲多，人民均懷有期望的心理，但均無恐戄狀態。斐鵬元帥似已與暹羅陸軍總司令阿布爾元帥成立諒解，由阿氏留任原職。斐鵬於今日下午會召見反對黨領袖，斐鵬於發表秉政之寬言時，會囑各政府官員照常供職，故各政府機關仍照常辦公，惟多添若干衛兵之駐守而已。按邊羅政府原係鑾丹能所領導，閣員多爲人民黨黨員，多爲抗日抵抗運動份子。斐鵬元帥乃日本佔領時之泰國總理，曾於一九四二年對盟國宣戰，一九四五年日本戰敗後，渠即被看管，並擬控以戰犯之罪。然一九四六年初，即邊羅與英國於是年元日發訂和約後之三個月，即由還京高等法院下令釋放。政界人士相信，今日之政變對於暹　王室不致有影響，迄至目前爲止，官方尙未就此次政變表示意見。中美使館均拒不發表意見，英國非官方人士則借此次政變，純因內政問題，惟各方面均信政變後之軍事政府將存續若干時期，斐鵬可望於今夜宣布新內閣之陣容。</p>
<p>〔聯合社受谷九日電〕暹羅軍隊今晨突然發動政變，由坦克車前導，控制全國，總理鑾丹龍舞會未終，業已被俘。</p>

<p>中國代表顧維鈞稱，此事完全失實，蘇外蒙武裝部隊數次强越中國邊境，侵入中國領士，進至離邊境一百里之白塔山。中國政府雖已向蘇，蒙兩國政府提出　重抗議，惟迄今尙未接獲覆牒。顧氏反對蘇代表葛羅米柯認為白塔山屬外蒙領土，據稱，葛羅米柯此語，當係根據沙皇時代之老地圖，此地圖係俄日兩國秘密劃分滿蒙勢力範圍後，於一九○七年所繪者。顧氏係在政委會討論是否要求安理會重新考慮關於十國入會被否決一事時，發表上項言論。顧氏稱，渠將不能允許外蒙古參加，除非該國能改變政策，顯示愛好和平之願望。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖八日電〕顧維鈞大使本日在聯大政委會宣稱，中國代表團贊同建議安理會於會籍申請方面，不使用否決權。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹委會　將赴希執行任務</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖八日電〕聯合國之十一人巴爾幹委員會，自經通過設立後，美國已任命前駐比大使及駐盧森堡公使寇克爲代表，中墨等國亦均已任命其代表。該會定本月廿一日在雅典開首次會議，廿四日抵薩朗尼加設總部，執行監督巴爾幹和平之任務。</p>
<h3>「小型大會」計劃　政委會在擬訂中</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約八日電〕聯大政委會不顧蘇聯集團之反對，業已建立一小組會，以草擬「小型大會」之計劃。如蘇聯退出聯合國，則此世界組織是否瓦解，甚成問題，但衆信蘇聯尙不致採取此項行動。然全體大會對「小型大會」案，似可獲得多數通過。目前政委會所擬訂之「小型大會」計劃，已比美國建議和緩，但此小型大會雖無立法　，不能作任何決定。然亦對世界輿論具有極大影響。</p>
<h3>羅斯福夫人指斥　蘇外交政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日合衆電〕羅斯福夫人於其「余之一日」專欄中，抨擊蘇聯外交政策，指斥共黨培植戰爭無可避免之觀念。實則使人　認為他國之行動定將引起戰爭之國家，即為蘇聯，余不認為美國人民意欲戰爭，然甚難使蘇聯　解此點。</p>

<p>〔路透社成功湖八日電〕美蘇加及瓜地瑪拉四國合組以覓取美蘇所提執行巴勒斯坦分治計劃建議之折衷案之小組會，今日討論甚久，僅獲些許進展。</p>
<p>蘇代表允諾將加代表所提方案，即由聯大選舉執行分治之委員會，但對安理會負責。關係方面僉認在目前階段中，尙不能預測美蘇對於此一折衷建議是否將予接受，蓋美國之立塲固爲在過渡期內應由聯大而非安理會負責對巴勒斯坦之管制。加代表皮爾遜在小組會中曾提出三大問題，　美蘇能否問意終止委治之日期；　英蘇能否同意由聯大任命委員會；　在委治終止後，獨立巴勒</p>
<h3>希特勒暗殺羅斯福　法院查明眞相</h3>
<p>羅美爾卒於一九四四年十月十四日，渠在西綫督戰遭美機射擊受傷後，傷勢已漸復原，希特勒賜以產業一管，告以渠若自殺，可獲國葬，家屬亦可免罪，不然將予殺死，蓋希特勒認為羅美爾與一九四〇年七月以炸彈謀刺希特勒之案有關，且認羅美爾聲響過隆，將與已有所不利。據羅美爾之妻稱：羅美爾在烏爾姆附近家中療傷已漸痊可，梅塞爾偕希特勒之副官布格道夫將軍突於十月十四日臨羅美爾寓所，與羅美爾晤談後，即吿羅妻謂泰希特勒令，羅美爾在十五分鐘內即應死亡，彼等携來審　，服後三秒鐘即可斃命。羅美爾旋即隨梅等兩人同車出門，不久羅美爾妻即復斯坦政府產生前，由何人負　　地治安。美蘇代表在會中對於此三要點、均未能表示具體意見。</p>
<p>〔路透社弗朗克報八日電〕據悉：警察　貝斯迦登　淸納粹法庭之請，已將率希特勒密令，參與暗殺前德國非洲軍總司令羅美爾元帥之梅審爾中將移送法院審訊。梅氏本人雖否認其事，然其文件已交檢察官審査。</p>

<h3>街頭巷尾的口吻　代替了外交領悟噙　第二屆聯合國大會花絮</h3>
<p>〔中央社紙約航訊〕在歷史的國際政治會議席上，除了各國代表在發言時對所發揮的言論，在理論上事實上力求其眞實正確有根有據之外，尤其注意其個人發言時之態度，竭盡彬彬有禮溫文爾雅之能事，寗可柔美帶剛，笑裏藏刀，而決不單刀直入，開門見山，有失禮儀，貽笑大方。　稍有外交經騐的人士都能有這樣雍容的風度。</p>
<p>這次第二屆聯合國大會的會塲情形，打破了以往一切國際會議的慣例，不但不溫文爾雅，並且舌劍唇槍，有的代表竟然盡舉街頭巷口的汚穢名辭，用在會議席間，來攻擊對方的發言人。十月七日在政治及安全委員會討論希臘問題的會議席間，有一幕空前的紊亂局面演出。大家不按秩序地爭相發言，彼此牴觸。有的用手指着發吼，有的用拳頭打桌子，有一而再再而三的在主席未准許以前發言。在社會人權及文化委員會裏，甚至有人高聲嚷「主席無法維持會塲秩序，我們應當換一個主席。」</p>
<p>政治及安全委員會裏紊亂局面的中心人物，是南斯拉夫代表貝勃勒，他是一位所謂富有革命性的靑年，黑色頭髮，情感激烈，模樣很漂亮，戰時有輝煌的戰績，在西班牙內戰時及南斯拉夫反抗德軍時，他都曾大顯身手，現任南斯拉夫外交部秘書，又是狄托將軍和副國務卿卡德的得力人才。他不能抑制自己的情感，每觸即發，在會塲中專事反對比代表斯巴克·英代表麥克奈爾盧森堡代表貝克。斯巴克以聰穎敏捷，思想靈快見長，麥克奈爾則彬彬有禮，善於修辭，貝克灰髮夾鬢，紳士派十足，但他擔任大會中小組委員會的主席，是一件最不討好的任務。</p>
<p>貝勃勒的左右手頗不乏人，最有力的帮手是蘇聯的首席代表維辛斯基和烏克蘭的代表曼紐斯基，所以在會場中無形的分成爲對立的兩派。</p>
<p>先是蘇聯和南斯拉夫的代表，堅持必需在會塲繼續討論美國「醞釀戰爭」的宣傳事件，貝勃勒發言時，就用了不少「叛徒」，「劊子手」，「造謠者」等的粗魯名詞。任小組會議主席的貝克就說：「在此會塲中，我下能允許任何人用這種粗魯的名詞，來汚辱聯合國的工作和聯合國的會員。」貝勃勒立刻回駁「主席不允許，那我只好不微求主席的同意而用這些名詞了。」</p>
<p>最後主席截斷了阿爾巴尼亞代表的談話，因爲他有亂會塲的秩序。阿爾巴尼亞代表盛怒地說：「我不過想要說明我的立塲。」主席員克還未及回答，貝勃勒就大聲說：「我反對主席的會議規則和會塲秩序。」</p>
<p>貝克說：「我請南斯拉夫代表再申述一遍剛才攻擊我的那一句話。」</p>
<p>貝勃勒真的又重複了一遍，並且說：「我覺得主席不應在阿爾巴尼亞代表發言未終了以前，截斷他的話頭。」</p>
<p>貝克說「阿爾巴尼亞代表不過又在重複的申述以前已經申述過了的意見，我不能接受貝勃勒先生的批評。」這時維辛斯基立刻站起來，帮貝勃勒說話：「主席應當給阿爾巴尼亞代表一個機會，以結束他的說話。」</p>
<p>主席只得請全體出席代表表決，是否同意南斯拉夫或蘇聯代表對主席的批評。</p>
<p>麥克奈爾不同意南斯拉夫和蘇聯代表的意見，他說：「能付表決最好，各代表應當尊敬主席，這一點是很重要的。更重要的一點是，若我們不能接受主席的會塲規則，那我們根本就不必來參加討論世界大事。主席，我們對你很感激，因爲你處置得很得體。」</p>
<p>表決的結果，大家一致擁護貝克，沒有人反對他，他們才啞口無言。</p>
<p>然後，主席貝克再問阿爾巴尼亞代表要說什麼？他回答：「我並沒有預先準備要說什麽，此刻沒有什麽可以補充了。」</p>
<p>一塲風波才吿平靜</p>
<p>在十月七日的第三小組會裏，提出了九月十八日蘇聯代表維辛斯基在代表大會所提出的關於美國「戰爭販子與法西斯式的宣傳」當受處置的問題，應否提出大會討論，並交國際新聞自由會議評議的一案，結果是卅三票對七票通過不予討論，但是會塲秩序因之大亂。</p>
<p>在大家爭　得不得要領時，張彭春博士指的現在我們要討論的是我們應否將這「宣傳」的問題，提出大會討論（To　recommend　or　not　torecommend），在本會議中討論問題的本身是不需要的，英國代表戴維斯也同意。誰知這一點立刻引趙另一位南斯拉夫代表麥茲的辯駁，他說：「應或不應（To　be　or　not　tobe）是莎士比亞名句，我們現在是在聯合國開會，不是上英文課，不必套用這名句」。在一般的聽衆看來，這明明是在吹毛求疵，無中生有的强辯。</p>
<p>最後秩序十分紊亂，阿根廷的代表，用拳打着桌子說：「這太不成話了，……太亂了，我們應常換一個主席。」</p>
<p>一班有經驗的外交家及曾經出席多次國際會議的新聞記者，認爲現在東歐國家所用的明顯的粗魯的詞句，可說是有史以來國際間空前未曾有過的，並且他們也認爲這些新革命家，不重用理智，而重用情感。則使很理智的言論，也必須以很大的聲調，很用力的拳頭來表現。</p>
<p>有的人很幽默地說：他走人了聯合國代表大會會議室，以爲是錯走進了茶館。有的說：聯合國代表大會現在會址是在「成功湖」，但到了會塲，旣看不見「湖」，又沒有「成功」。（中央社記者朱梅先）</p>

<h3>國代候選人陳培德　發表對政治主張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議員陳培德（見圖）參加競選國大代表，昨特發表其政治主張云：渠始終從事工運，來自民間，如有機會，願代表人民督促政府做到下列各項：　實行民主政治，一切政治設施，應以增進人民福利爲目的。　建設大上海，復興社會事業，使上海市民均能安居樂業。　革除社會惡習，剷除民蠢，肅淸貧汚，提倡節約。　力促减輕捐稅，以促進工商業之發展，亦减少人民之負擔。　勵行生產，抑平物價，安定民生。陳君現年五十五歲，畢業江南學院，廿年前，會以某外商烟廠抗不納稅，因事關國家主權，未忍坐視，乃奮起領導該廠工人以罷工爲警吿，卒使該廠就範，遵令繳納國稅。抗戰時，歷任國際反侵略運動會中國分會第一屆理事，全國工人抗敵後援會理事；勝利後任木市總工會整理委員兼宣傳科長，現任市黨部第廿九區常委暨市參議員。</p>

<h3>辨淸嫌疑何·何必輕生　光華大學學生自殺遺書自悔兩次糊塗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕八日下午四時許，漢口路金山飯店五樓，來一靑年，闢五〇六號房間，化名張正明，七時曾喚茶役，囑買菜飯，進餐後，即閉房門安睡。比至翌晨十時許，該號鈴牌落下，由早班茶役張志淸入內訊問，答稱無事，並謂尙要睡覺，迨至中午十二時，未見房間內動靜，茶役頓生疑　，入房探視，瞥見該靑年橫臥床上，面色慘白，社志糢糊，默不發言，情知有異，亟報賬房間，召救護車載送仁濟醫院救治，未及抵院，即在中途殞命。</p>
<p>圖　自殺之萬甲三</p>
<p>失竊西裝·涉嫌開除</p>
<p>事後由金山飯店據情報吿該管老閘警分局，當經蔣股長飭股員張魁棟，率警馳往調査。獲悉死者眞名萬甲三，係光華大學經濟系二年級學生，蘇州人，現年二十三歲，因細故刺激，潛服安神藥片自殺。復在房中搜査，獲得皮包內藏有美國出品之安神藥片空瓶一隻，並留有致吳市畏，兪局長，其父萬孟權，姑丈王劍英及同學諸忠等遺書五通。在遺書中，獲悉其父在江西郵政管理局爲股長，姑丈王劍英住本市天潼路愼餘里卅六號，當由承辦警員傳王劍英到案詢問萬之近况。據稱日前校中有一同學失竊西裝一套，及法幣四十八萬元，事後經訓育主任在宿舍中逐一檢査，在萬身畔抄得魚肝油丸一瓶，疑其所竊，嗣王接校中通吿，稱萬患急性育賜炎，請派人前往（按萬之上海通訊處係爲王寓）王見條後，立即趕往，始悉並非患病，實爲行竊，命其退學，萬必因此氣憤，出此下策，服毒經生云云。茲錄其遺書如後：</p>
<p>致市長函·詳述經過</p>
<p>致吳市長函：大意謂：「我是光華大學的一個大學生，名萬甲三，廿三歲，蘇州人，上次曾做過二次糊塗事情，因爲這樣，听以被逼得死了，不過這是被屈死的，所以我爲了要死後淸白，才敢冒昧的致函市長，千萬請代爲澈査這一事件，現在把經過寫下：上學期因錯穿一劉姓同學草黃色美軍褲一條，本學期又因校中伙食欠佳，私取了同學維他命丸一瓶被發覺，所以這一次校中同學被竊了西裝和現鈔，他們就逼着我自承是這個竊賊，還逼着我寫了張賠償書，那末我為什麽會寫那頁賠償書呢？因為已有了上面這二個汚點，雖經我再三的說明，當時又有誰會相信我呢？况且當時同學都咬定我是賊，情勢對我是多麼不利，而且校裏陳主任·溫力虎·楊保球同學，更以警局拷打來嚇我，我也怕眞的鬧開了，一定先會吃着眼前虧，受到衆同學侮辱。假使一旦更在報紙上發表了，一定我名譽先受到影響，家父也會活活的氣死，所以才咬定了牙，寫了那張賠償書，不過當時我曾確實的說賠是我可以賠，但是我沒認偸西裝現鈔。</p>
<p>請下命令·澈査此案</p>
<p>現在校裏認我係巨賊，命我休學，這叫我以後怎見人？怎有面目回家裏呢？所以我決定自殺了，可是這不是畏罪，是爲我覺得這太不容易辨淸楚，听以才呈請鈞長千萬請下命令，嚴査此案，傳得水落石出，俾我亦可死得淸白了。我想以滬市偵緝力量，一定會査出究竟偸這西裝親鈔是誰？如此我死後有知，當亦感激不盡了」。（下略）</p>
<p>致兪局長函：略謂：「在我死後，希望警局會以最新頴的科學方法，澈査我們校裏偸西裝現鈔的究竟是誰？」（下略）</p>
<p>致父函云：「爲了一時糊塗，做了二件糊塗事，才得到今日的結果，一切的詳情，想姑丈總會吿訴大人的。」</p>
<p>致姑父母函：「你們二位待我這樣的好，簡直當我像親生子一般，眞使小輩們感激非凡，這件不名譽的事發生，實無面目見人。」</p>
<p>致同學諸忠函：「昨夜累了你一夜眞太對不起了，此　將來警局價査，一定會水落石出，我死得乾净，死後有知，當亦感激你不盡了。」</p>
<h3>少年警察曾受侮辱　實習期中得到許多經騐·正式執行之時決不客氣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第一批少年警察四十各，在漕河涇市立兒意敎養所受了三個多星期的專門訓練，待等服裝全部製備，就將在今明天正式開始出現在街頭執行任務這些少年警察所負的工作有三：　到各菜館勸導節約。　整理交通，在電車和公共汽車站維持秩序。　檢査無塲。（這一項工作待等從女靑年軍中挑選的女警察訓練完畢後，配合執行。）</p>
<p>昨天，兒童敎養所長周祖望招待各報記者，去漕河涇參觀，爲了要知通少年警察訓練的成績如何，應記者之請，先叫他們來一下實騐。進午餐時，記者們權充酒樓食客，一隊少年警察就跑前來執行檢査。假定所用飯菜已違反了筵席節約的規定，領隊的少年警察就很禮貌的問明了一桌的主人是誰，便向主人解釋菜肴已超過規定，並設明厲行節約的理由，勸導今後勿再違反。做主人的或與之敷衍，或懷着大爺有的是錢。不用你管的態度，旁座衆客亦紛紛帮忙說話，但是少年警察仍很禮貌的一一解釋，勸導怖約，使受之者深爲感動。</p>
<p>這一種勸導筵席節約的工作，很不容易討好。在訓練期中，一批批少年警察亦曾出發到各大酒樓去實習過，有許多食客態度倔强，一位食客拿輕蔑的態度戲言：「小弟弟，你這種菜還沒有吃過呢！」有一位食客則指洋酒爲本國酒，因警察年少不懂而被朦混過。就在實習中少年警察得到了不少經驗，今後正式執行任務時，如過故意侮辱的食客，他們將立即報吿警察局詢辦。</p>
<p>少年警察的服裝和美國海軍裝束差不多，祇帽子和現在的警察相同。麥爾登呢的制服，白腰帶，黑皮鞋，白鞋套。左領製有隊號，右領有YP字樣（Young　Man　Police）。領下有警鴿二。左臂佩有少年警察臂章，另有警笛絲帶一根橫貫胸前，甚爲英挺。</p>
<p>這一羣十五六歲的少年，過去多半是流浪街頭和衣食不週的難童，經過敎養訓練，今日將以令你驚異的新的姿態，出現在面前。以忠誠的態度，爲國家執行任務。（附圖爲少年警察在記者進食時表演檢査情形。）</p>

<h3>職業婦女之家　女靑年會宿舍　充滿溫暖歡樂</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在高樓林立的圓明園路上。將近蘇州河的一端，一幢褪了色的紅磚三層樓小洋房，處在四週宏偉的建築中，　得很是寒傖；然而，在陳舊的門牆以內，却充滿了靑春的活力，洋溢着溫暖與歡樂，歌聲和笑聲。這一所小小的洋房，就是著名的職業婦女之家上海女靑年會宿舍。</p>
<p>住在這宿舍裏的是四十四位遠離了家庭的單身職業婦女，她們來自全國各地，年齡大都在二十至三十之間，敎育程度至少在高中以上。她們的職業以公務員，銀行行員，郵務員，護士，敎員爲多，也有做大學敎授或女建築師的出衆人物。</p>
<p>像一個融洽大家庭</p>
<p>因爲她們的智識水準很相近，而且都是遠離了家庭的單身女子，所以雖然來自各個不同風俗和習慣的城市或鄉村，各人從事不同的職業，甚至有着絕對不同的性格，但互相之問容易瞭解，容易產生親密的友誼，每到黃昏，她們陸續地公畢回來，只要看到同伴們親切的笑容，和許多關懷的詢問，會使她們感到溫暖的慰藉。每當晚飯時分，各個不同寢室的女孩們全都在一間餐室裏聚會，每一張餐桌上都有無拘束的談笑，恰像一個融洽的大家庭。到了夜間，有讀書的，有彈琴，有唱歌的，琴聲歌聲，伴和着輕鬆的笑語，這些歌聲和笑語冲淡了她們心中濃重的懷鄕病，她們又回到天眞無邪的黃金般的少女時代了。在一陣鈴聲響過，大家都沉默下來，準備入睡，直到第二天淸晨的起床鈴驚醒了她們的淸夢，每個人一面互相道着：「早！」「你早！」：一面忙碌地梳洗和化裝後，各自開始一天的工作。每天上午九時以後，宿舍裏又是人去樓空的情調了。</p>
<p>從沒有不愉快情事</p>
<p>宿舍裏的管理相當嚴格，男性的資客僅能到會客室爲止，每晚十時半規定熄燈，大門就要下鎖。小姐們除非有特別的事情事先聲明，否則就得饗閉門羹了。這對於有些正在談戀愛中的小姐雖然感到不便，但是她們都很知道遵守規則。據負責管理的幹事華女士說，宿舍裏從來沒有發生過不愉快的事情。</p>
<p>每個月的宿費，包括早晚兩餐，以本月份來說，祗有六十萬元，這對於薪水階級的小姐們可以說是很經濟的了；如果離開發薪日子不遠，而手頭一時拮据的話，還可以通融幾天。因此，大多數小姐都是一住進去後就一直沒有離開過，除非是結婚，出國，或者職業調動。結婚的人數比例很少，從去年三月宿舍開辦到現在，一年多的時間中，因結婚而離開的不過四五位小姐罷了。</p>
<p>希望擴大宿舍範圍</p>
<p>不不少少職業婦女　往於這一所「大家庭式」的宿舍，但因狀位的限制而無法容納。截至現在爲止，先後向女靑年會登記的已達百人以上，每天都有幾個來自遠方的女孩子來拜訪宿舍幹事，訴說她們無家可歸的苦况。女靑年會現在唯有希望能籍社會的力量，來擴大宿舍的範圍，儘量容納這些離鄕背井爲社會服務的姊妹們，讓他們在樸素而安靜的住所中，得到休息與溫暖。</p>

<h3>逸園足球第一聲　白鷹小勝青白隊</h3>
<p>〔國光社訊〕足球友誼賽，昨日下午三時，靑白與白鷹交綏於逸圍球塲。惟天有雨意，僅有千餘球迷到塲，熱鬧未如理想。靑白以靑白白出馬，白鷹陣容攻守平衡，角逐結果，白鷹以三比二小勝靑白。陣容如下：依凡白鷹許而茲格里非司奥洛夫W潘脫遜愛夫奎C愛德華　拉琴王愛德華諾維　夫下福恩密郞上</p>

<p>三時十分，裁判何春暉鳴笛開賽，雙方列陣，白鷹先攻，靑白全力招架，未有差池。五分鐘時，愛德華來犯，吳凱敏犯規，被判十二碼，潘脫遜操刀野逸，福恩右路再犯，薩拉琴中央突破，於人業中射中紅心，一比〇白鷹首開紀錄。靑白傾力反攻，造成混戰，至十九分　時小羅。祿生·秀淸三騎並進，深入敵陣，小羅派司中央，秀淸搭住力射，依凡諾夫挽救不及，球入網底，一比一扳成平手。迨上半時終塲前四分鐘，番兵又見活躍，密郞單騎立功，白鷹遂以二比一佔優於前半。</p>
<p>休息過後，易陣再戰，雙方均以生力軍上塲。靑白先取攻勢，奈番兵兇猛，無法進展，演成拉鋸。七分鐘時福恩右路疾進，底角傳中，秦必高衝出救駕，番將薩拉琴先到一步，球從必高脚上彈入網內，三比一番軍又獲一城。二分鐘後，靑白敵前猛犯，高秀淸兩次叩關未入，至十九分鐘時，哈增明左角勾中，秀淸力射破網，二比三相差僅一球，靑白軍心大振，方謀恢復失地，而收軍金鳴，白鷹遂以三比二小勝靑白。</p>

<h3>防止物價波動　當局籌劃擴大配給範圍</h3>
<p>美對華貸敎尙無具體決定之消息傳出後，一般抱有依賴外援心理者，覺大失所望，而投機者流復趁機在市塲猛吸，兼之久緊突　之銀根，更予彼等良好活動機會，致穩定已歷相當時日之物價，又呈蠢蠶思動現象。有關當局對此已密切注意。據悉吳市長銷假視事後，將於日内恢復舉行經濟檢査會報。警局經濟科爲事先防範免使漲風擴大起見，已決定從事偵査工作。在各市塲調査，有無操縱及故意抬價之行爲。蓋際此物價穩定，供求平衡之時，不應再有漲風！倘有波動，顯係有人從中作祟，故決嚴加取締。尤其對於金鈔黑市，必予澈底消滅，根絕此種不良現象，同時有關當局對於煤球布疋食糖及食油等物品配給，決如期實行。並籌劃擴大配給範圍，以减輕公敎人員及市民之負担。</p>
<p>農民銀行發表　上半年度農貸</p>
<p>據農民銀行發表，該行本年度上半年貸出之農貸，已達二千○六十五億元。其中以農業生產貸款最多，佔百分之五十七以上，約爲一千一百九十餘億元。其次則爲農產運銷貸款，佔百分之十七弱，農村副業貸款又次之，佔百分之九强。農田水利貸款佔百分之八强，收復區緊急貸款佔百分之一點强，農業推廣貸款佔百分之四强，綏靖區貸款佔百分之二弱。所有上列之貸款，東北流通券部份，未計算在內。</p>
<p>又農產特產品貸款，係該行主辦之一種特殊貸款，用以協助各　特產品之加工製造，提高品質，便利運輸等方面。本年度上半年蠶絲貸款，貸出四千餘億。棉花貸款貸出一千三百六十六億。烟葉貸款，貸出二百八十餘億。茶業貸款，貸出八百十餘億。漁業貸款因範圍僅有江浙兩省，故貸款僅十億。此外各災區所辦之緊急貸款，亦不在少數。黃汛區已核准貸款一千億，目前已貸出二百億。淮汛區絡續貸出亦達三十九億。該行本年度各種貸款，共準備貸出九千億元。除上半年貸出者外，餘數將於本年底內絡續貸出。</p>
<h3>原料供不應求　毛紡前途黯淡</h3>
<p>本市毛絨紡絨整染工業公會，現擁有會員六一家，內中全能廠（紡織整染）計十一家，紡絨綫及織海勃龍者各五。紡粗紗者三，餘則僅具織的設備而已。共約工人七千餘，最多者約八百人，最少十數人。產量方面雖少精確佔計，然平均每月約五十萬碼至六十萬碼。若全部開工，產量可以加倍，則每月原料需要外匯約三五○萬美元，每季共一。○五○萬美元。依照現在限額分配量，其比例僅及五分之一。爲維持工人生活計，其資金稍厚廠商，不惜向市塲收集原料，以補匱乏。惜存貨不多，供不應求，羊毛現値每磅二四萬元，高等毛條幾漲達四十餘萬元。如資金薄弱者，改爲輪流開工，或竟全部停頓，或改用飛棉以替代之。</p>
<p>按公會所得分配外匯中，國營紡建公司佔百分之二八，洋商百分之一六，外埠各廠又爲百分之一九，本市民營各廠僅及百分之三七而已。</p>
<p>過去公會員廠分配所得外匯辦法，規定老廠依照開工錠子百分之三百計算，新廠爲三分之一比例，如新廠於每季限額分配之末一個月開工者，其分配量又僅及九分之一。當時雙方曾引起爭辯，公會所持理由，爲政府第一季所給外匯，計一四○萬元，以後爲二○○萬元，增加額度爲三分之一，新廠分配量當僅限於此數。新廠方面意見，認爲納游資於生產途徑，乃配合國策。一廠開創伊始，開支浩大，無力向市塲購置原料。所希望者，應仗公會主持公道，即機會均等，平均分配，不能厚此薄彼，造成歧視。前者已成過去，後者自宜重作合理解決云。</p>

<h3>僑滙日减</h3>
<p>黑市一日不消滅　僑匯無法復常態</p>
<p>據中國銀行國外部負責人談，僑匯邇來又日見減少，每日匯來之數字，微乎其微。以前中央銀行每次調整匯率一次，其其調整後之第一個月，僑匯確存增加，一個月以後，始逐漸減少。當外匯平衡基金會成立時，僑匯增加，每週可收入法幣五十億左右，目前因黑市不斷上漲，幾高出市價百分之四十，僑匯在此情形之下，又逐日减少。外傳央行將另訂一一項匯率，專事爭取僑匯，此屬不可能之傳說。目前爭取僑匯之焦點，仍在取締黑市。黑市一日不消滅，僑匯決無法保持正常云。</p>

<h3>讀者信箱　「黃牛組織」林立浦濱</h3>
<p>福州本報讀者來函揭發不正當之需索</p>
<p>本市外灘及十六鋪一帶，設有「旅行社」多家，其業務爲向各輪船公司收購船票，然後轉售旅客，其價格往往較票面定價爲高，一般旅客每因行色忽忽而忍痛承買，聞有不少貧苦難胞，因流離滬濱急於旋里，此種「旅行社」更乘人之危橫加勒索，毫無通融餘地，又因彼等大量吸收船票，造成「票荒」局面。從而遂其需索之慾望，當局對於此種變相之「黃牛」組織，若聽其橫行無忌，則旅客受累無窮矣。本報讀者許惠平君，日前福州來函，述及此事，茲爲刋出，希有關當局加以注意，以安行旅。原函如下：</p>
<p>編者光生：本人於九月十四日自滬乘「南山」輪船來榕，於船上無意中遇有山東客臨沂縣薛莊鄉難民，張永曾，關懷珍二家大小男十二人（中小孩八人）來榕求生，專前由上海中山東二路一四八號「上海中華旅行社」介紹乘坐該船，強收每人船票十三萬五千元，彼等難民窮困無法出此巨款，再三懇請減少不允，終於禦寒冬衣數件變賣湊足一〇八萬巨款，後該社派人引領上船，復取去每人汽車費，渡船費各二千元，共計三萬二千元，船中且不供膳，時本人知悉后即查詢船上黃買辦等，據稱：「僅收該社帶領人交來每人船費四萬元，計三十二萬元，且難民榮軍等本船均有免費優待，彼等所付巨款顯係該社所吞沒」，等語，當下均有不平之氣。至榕後本人特將實情函「上海中華旅行社」查詢，並請將餘款退回該難民（彼等現住榕電燈公司新廠），詎知至今月餘，該社竟置之不理。</p>
<p>查「上海中華旅行社」原係服務性質，理應爲大衆至誠服務，取利公道，尤以貧苦人等，更應竭力爲之服務，今該社非特不盡服務之本份，反而乘機詐取難民，蔑視法令，損及同業之營業道德，敗壞社會之優良風氣，人人怒憤不平，今除將實情呈報有關機關查辦外，特再將　情函請貴報予以披露，俾社會人士能以人類正義之同情，予該社之不肖份子之警吿，以儆效尤，是所感盼！讀者許惠平謹上十月廿日。</p>

<h3>科學的功罪</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>科學，像一支光輝的長明火，照望在人類的大道上。</p>
<p>自從人類開始了征服自然的格鬥，世界的文明進步，眞是難以佔價。</p>
<p>幾百年前，也可以說是幾十年前的人，無論如何也想不到今日的世界，享受今日的幸福。</p>
<p>可是人類的嫉妒，　狹，猜疑這些票惡劣的性格却達還沒有完全消除，瘋狂的戰爭製造者往往帶來了殘酷的浩劫。</p>
<p>在這裏，很不幸，在飛速遍進的科學，人類文叫的動力，就被罪惡的手，控制着作殘害人類的事，科學成爲罪徒的工具，作惡的助手，沒有深刻認　科學的人，就不免要懷疑和非難的了。</p>
<p>事實上，如果靜靜地回溯過去和現在的現實而檢討的話，就可以見到，這種觀念是片面的。</p>
<p>在憂慮中成爲殺人「死光」的放射綫，已成爲今日硏究各項科學和治病的重要工具，「戰爭工具」的火藥原是今日建築大小</p>
<p>閘等工程的必需品。原子能正是龐大的動力源。也又有誰願仍然生在黑暗無燈德晚上和過受盡疾</p>
<p>病　　的生活呢？而最後帶給好自由平等的民主國家勝利的，又是什麽呢？毋疑地是科學進步的功勞</p>
<p>超音波的最近的二個硏究吿，該就是一個最淸楚的說明。一個富關興趣的故事。</p>
<p>超聲波（Ultra　Sonic），就是那蝙蝙賴以黑夜飛行，人類觸及月球「無形的手指」的東西。</p>
<p>一種不能聽見，更不能看見的波。現在不再是沒人問津的東西了。</p>
<p>在美國麻省理工學院（MasSachusetts　Institute　of　Technology）的畢業禮中，被邀演說的美國空軍司令官喬治，肯納將</p>
<p>軍（Goerge　Kenney）的購詞，就是聞述這波的神秘的。</p>
<p>超音波，當人類再要戰爭時，可能是一個可怕的工具，在科學有着到時代前進的今日，也許</p>
<p>不是祀人憂天的事。一架置有「超聲感設備」的飛機，（在人類的耳中不再覺得他的存在，因爲</p>
<p>他是無聲的。）悠悠在一個城市的上空繞過，那裏的人們就在不知不覺中失去了動作，失去了</p>
<p>思想，因爲他們的神經已永遠地毀了。</p>
<p>也在同一個時間，大西洋的彼岸，又聽到了科學家的動人的消息。運用這超高頻率的聲波的消息。</p>
<p>英國新聞局（British　Ministry　of　information）報吿英國淨洗研究聯合會（British　La</p>
<p>underers'Rescarch　Aseociation）根據二十六位科學家和他們的助理工作者的研究材料，一個</p>
<p>新的方法　在建樹之中，那便是「聲波淨洗」（Laundry　by　Sound）</p>
<p>灰康的依附織維（那些組成衣服用品穿上每個人的身，佈滿每個家的一切的本質）是由於一些微小的電力，肥皂泡沬作用</p>
<p>和擦洗促使他中和，然後把他帶去。但是有很多細小的汚垢，往往仍是難於除去的。料學家們因比要計劃一個機構，而使肥皂發</p>
<p>揮高度作用，有效地去震撼那裏埃的糾纏。他們就準備用這超音</p>
<p>波的震動法（Ultra　Sonic　VibRationM　ethod）</p>
<p>別譏笑那些科學家的滑稽吧，同樣正也不要憂慮罪惡的手控制着無聲的東西來行使毀滅的工</p>
<p>作。聯想上面的二個報吿，也許那防禦超音波武器的器械，出人意料地就是這淨洗的機構。而原</p>
<p>來的「殺人利器」，就被像客人樣的款待來作爲最有效的工具，來淨洗整個家庭。和整個城市的污垢了。</p>
<p>千萬別爲了科學的創造在戰爭這殺人，殘酷的事業中的行爲而論罪，要知道科學永遠是人類</p>
<p>最忠誠，最有力的朋友！幸福和罪惡，掌握人類自己的手中，由他們自己造成的！</p>
<p>又有什麽理由去懷疑科學的前進：而不去眞正剷除那些化幸福爲罪惡的惡魔呢？</p>
<h3>德國爲什麽沒有原子彈</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>一直到納粹投降爲止，美國軍界爲了「納粹到底能不能造出原子彈」問題，感到不安和恐慌　其</p>
<p>實這是多慮，在今年九月初英國的「自然」雜誌上刋登了德國物理學家希森堡（Werner　Heisenberg）的一文中，這個諾貝爾物理學獎金獲得</p>
<p>者正式說明了德國爲什麽造不出原子彈的原因。</p>
<p>他說他們差不多快要很成功的完成　的「堆　」（Pile）的</p>
<p>建造，而從來就沒有企圖去造原子彈，僅用「堆　」來發出原子能量而已。在戰前，舉世的物理</p>
<p>學家都知邋鈾的一種輕而極少的同位素「U-235」的原子可以分裂而發出很大的能量，同時他們</p>
<p>也曉得原子分裂後的中子會繼續的再去使其他原十分裂的「鍵式</p>
<p>分裂作用」（Chain　Reaction），所以這種美國認爲「秘密」，其實德國也知道。到了一九三九</p>
<p>年戰爭一爆發，德國也知道了美國在用鉅款從事原子能的探討（希森堡博士未說明如何知道的）</p>
<p>一，於是他們也立刻擬定計劃開始硏究。但是，博士在文中惋惜道：「德人在一九三三年到一九三</p>
<p>九中是過分疏忽了原子物理學」，因之他們沒有工具，如最要緊的「諧旋加速器」（Cyclotron</p>
<p>）。僅有兩所設備很好的試騐，在無工具情形之下，他們的硏究遭到很大的障礙。</p>
<p>開始時，他們採取的方法和他們的敵手（指美國）是一樣的，爲了獲取原子能，決定必須先</p>
<p>從鈾鑛中提煉鈾的一種輕而稀少的同位素「U-235」在這一點上美國在橡嶺（Oak　Ricge一般人稱原子城）已經作到，而德國</p>
<p>科學家們爲了搶救一些其他被轟炸破壞的工業，就沒有立即作成</p>
<p>另外在建造一個能完成「鏈式分裂作用」的堆垜（Chain-reacting　pile）上，他們也犯了大</p>
<p>錯，這堆垜就是使某種物質與鈾遇到後，就使原子分裂並且使分裂出的中子减低速度而能繼續鏈</p>
<p>鎖似的使其他原子分裂，在理論上美德兩國都知道炭素和重水就是這「某種物質」，但美國是用</p>
<p>炭素（一種軟而黑的天然炭）來充作「控制器」的，而德國科學家怏定用重水，這樣他們便集中</p>
<p>去製造　又慢又費錢的重水了。於是讓美國人佔了先。</p>
<p>美國是用碳素　來生成爆炸強烈的「　」（Piutonuum），而德人對這點的可能性的想法</p>
<p>是非常模糊的。所以他根本就沒有企圖區造原子彈，自然也不需要產生「　」的請旋加速器，他</p>
<p>們的目的是如何從堆　中把原子能直接利用到一般工業上，並且他們經費太少，僅佔美國化　的一千分之一（美國會用去二億</p>
<p>萬金）。況且德國的高級軍事領袖門從來就認爲一九四二年戰爭就會結束，用不著化這樣大的金</p>

<h3>飛機航行位置</h3>
<p>— 萬功禹</p>
<p>——一個新的測定方法——</p>
<p>飛機航行時，位置的測定是一個很重要的問題，這裏來介紹一種新的測定儀器和方法。</p>
<p>許多飛行位置的問題的簡單的解決，新的無綫電飛行位置測定器（Radio　flight-position　fixer）供給駕駛員一個繼</p>
<p>續的，容易遵循的飛機位置的影像，這是一個空軍官佐發明的，而且將由（Sperry　Gyroscope）公司製造以供給軍用</p>
<p>，牠被建識用爲惡劣氣候下空中安全改良的方法，以及節省在機塲上空預備降落而逗留的時間的方法，無綫電測定器適用於一點到一點的空航，牠能被用於視綫不淸時的低飛着陸。</p>
<p>無綫電測定器的原理不渦是簡單的三角學的關係，兩無綫電方位指示器各別地轉向地上的二個站，從每個指示器</p>
<p>的中心，一這光綫經過儀器的透明面射出來，牠的角度相當於飛機從站中間的方向，飛置的位置就是這兩道光綫的交點</p>
<p>，因爲這個看見到的指示點完全跟飛機的地位而移動，光綫交點的移動的軌跡就是飛機航行綫投影在地上的路錢，飛行</p>
<p>的方向被在兩個無綫電測定器中S的速綫上的中點的動向儀（Elux　gote）指示出來，因爲在這個儀器上，兩個無綫電</p>
<p>測定器的中心相距三英吋，所以在儀器上表示的每吋有幾哩的比例尺能量地圖上兩站間的距離去決定牠。</p>
<p>到任何選定的目的地的飛行過程，可用蠟筆或螢光筆（在夜問）在測定器的表面上劃出，然後使得光綫的交點常在</p>
<p>這一根劃出的路錢上，意思就是說·飛機照了原定的航綫飛行，在有規則的飛行航綫的飛機中，所包含的面積或全部航</p>
<p>錢上的飛行站的簡單的地圖可預製在另外的透明面上，以備應用，障碍物，限制的區域，和別的適當的飛行紀錄可表明</p>
<p>在上面。</p>
<p>這種裝置對於盲目接近和盲目着陸的價値，可在任何駕駛員都能按照指示，飛行於某指定區域或以任何方向接近的事實中看到。</p>
<p>包括無綫常位計（全重的　）和別的設置，測定器全部的重量是二百磅，大部商用飛機至少帶有一個無綫電方位計</p>
<h3>突變是化學性的改變嗎？</h3>
<p>— 郝天和</p>
<p>另外的一類，如砒（：As）也許可以替代芥子氣裏的硫（：S）和　（：N）但是含砒的物合物，在生理的情况下，很</p>

<p>性，運用睛類（Nitrite）和等　類（isonitrite）以及相當的硫代氧化物（thiocyanates）和等硫代氧化物（isothiccyana</p>
<p>ies）作爲聯合部分，因此，對於芥子油（Allyl　isothiocyanate）値得注意，因爲</p>
<p>這種化合物，能够表現一種微弱而確切的突變素作用。</p>
<p>從另一方面看來，這類的化學構造，並不是突變素所必需的，道是從事實所表</p>
<p>示的，哈同（Hacorn）及聶格力（Nigri）把果蠅的卵巢割下來，浸在石碳酸（</p>
<p>Phenol）的微弱的溶液裏，也能產生很多突變的現象。</p>
<p>芥子油（Allyl　isothicyanate）在自然界中存在自菜屬（Brassica）的植物體内，我們不知道牠在道種植物體内，是否有突變素的作用。想來很有趣味的，</p>
<p>去觀察那些天然的突變素對於自動的突變</p>
<p>，應負多麼大的責任，密勒氏和司密士（Mott-Smith）已經表明宇宙輻射（Cosmic　radiathion）和自然界的輻射作用，在定量方面，不足以計算我們所看到的那種</p>
<p>自動突變的速率的。鐵木非夫—來，守夫斯　（Timofeff-ressovsky）戚墨（Zimmer）和德爾白盧克（Delbruk）都提議細胞核裏所生的那種不規則的溫度有時</p>
<p>可以超過產生一種突變所需的能力從這裏所報吿的結果看來，可能有一部分的天然的突變，是由於生物體内的突變素的作用</p>
<p>，那種突變素的產生也許是自己的因基作用的結果，這樣的一種假定，在已知的實例中，可以找到支持，就是有種固定的因</p>
<p>基，能够影響其餘的因基而發生突變，甚至影響到特種的因基，所以要找天然的突變素是極有興趣的，不過也許是很困難的</p>
<p>，因爲一種天然的突變素，可能有一種特性，就是對於那種生物本身，不會有劇烈的影響，否則那種生物就不能生存了，還</p>
<p>有在某種的生理情狀之下，在幾種有效物質的力量與一個因基或數個因基的感應力之間，在演化的過程中，最後總要達到一種精密合理的平衡，這個系統含有突變素在內，而突變素的產生雖由因基所管制，</p>
<p>但是往往在因基脫離了牠正常的因子式的環境的時候，一種天然的突變素可以產生</p>
<p>很不同的效果，或毫無效果，所以從某種生物所得的結果不一定可以運用到別的生</p>
<p>物上去，有時也許還要和運用劇烈的方法如X光綫和芥子氣而得來的結果相抵觸，</p>
<p>雖然我們還要考慮到一種可能性，就是物種的演化，採取突變的方式是要適應環境的需要使突變素的產生，和因蓋的感應力之間，能够達到一個平衡。</p>

<h3>Marshall Reports to Both Houses' Foreign Affairs Committees: Estimated U.S. Aid to China - $1 Billion Available Next Year</h3>
<p>(United Press International, Washington, 8th) Secretary of State Marshall will report to the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees on the 10th regarding estimates of aid needed for China (possibly including other regions) as well as aid to Europe. According to well-informed sources, China may be able to utilize approximately $1 billion in U.S. aid in the coming year. However, the scope of the aid has not yet been finalized. It is certain that the United States has reached the minimum level of aid and is actively seeking ways to support China to prevent economic collapse, communist military oppression, and political division. Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vandenberg advised the government weeks ago, and recently reiterated his view, stating that the government should not only report to Congress the estimated aid needed for Europe but also the total amount of aid in order to favorably prepare for the promotion of American interests in other parts of the world. The only other part of the world needing U.S. aid is the Far East. The State Department has been studying the Far East issue because it is not only related to China but also to the economic interests of China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other countries in the region. The region is not as closely linked as Europe, but if the entire region can reach a common understanding, some problems can be alleviated. Marshall's main task on the 10th will be to discuss the urgent needs of France and Italy and their relationship to the long-term recovery of Europe. It is expected that he will only discuss the China issue in general terms. Marshall intends to reiterate the government's theory that the restoration of Europe can promote the revival of world trade, which will greatly benefit other parts of the world, including the Far East. However, this action does not provide as much practical assistance to the Far East as it does to other major regions. In this context, Marshall will mention the issue of U.S. aid to China. Apart from supplying some relief goods, transferring some surplus war materials, and providing a limited amount of ammunition for Chinese army rifles, the U.S. has done little. One of the difficulties encountered by the State Department in estimating China's needs is that China is too disorganized, and only a relatively limited amount of funds can be used for relief in the region.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Manchu people living in Beijing held a banquet at noon on the 9th to entertain Pu Xinyu and others, the chairman of the Beijing Manchu Cultural Association. Mo Dehui, Guanglu and others attended. During the banquet, Pu reported that the association's registration has been contacted with the Ministry of Social Affairs and will be completed in the short term. He hoped that Manchu compatriots would be able to openly engage in patriotic activities from the standpoint of the nation in the future in order to maintain the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's nationalism. Subsequently, Mo and Guang gave speeches, both saying that the number of Manchu National Assembly representatives had increased to seventeen, and that they should be invigorated and united to live up to the government's expectations. Guanglu's wife then recited a poem in Manchu on the spot, which translates to: "We are in the borderlands, we protect the borderlands, we love our motherland, we will always love our motherland! We are most proud, we are thousands of cities in our motherland!" Finally, it was decided to set up a Beijing branch of the Manchu Cultural Association, and Pu will go to Zhenjiang and Hangzhou to contact Manchu people scattered throughout the area.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Deliberately Disregards China!</h3>
<p>The Foreign Ministers' representatives of the four major powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, recently held a meeting in London to begin discussing the German peace treaty issue. The representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France unanimously advocated that China should be invited to participate in drafting the German peace treaty and that China should also be one of the invited nations, along with the four major powers, when the German peace conference is convened in the future. Unexpectedly, the Soviet representative, Smirnov, uniquely held a different opinion at the meeting on the 8th of this month, refusing the suggestions of the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the grounds that China was not a signatory to Germany's surrender, causing a setback for the Foreign Ministers' conference of the four major powers. Although this is a "rehash of old tunes" by Soviet diplomats, at a time when our Foreign Minister Wang is strongly advocating that the Soviet Union should participate in the Japanese peace treaty and resolutely opposing the American saying of "excluding the Soviet Union," the Soviet Union insists on opposing China's participation in drafting the German peace treaty. I wonder what our diplomatic authorities will think? Moreover, the Soviet Union's behavior of harming others without benefiting itself will only arouse unhappiness between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. What good will this do for the Soviet Union? It is truly puzzling.</p>
<p>First, under the current international relations, world peace is indivisible. Before World War II, Soviet diplomats had already loudly proclaimed the theory that peace is indivisible, and it was applauded by the peoples of various countries. Now, after the end of World War II, international turmoil is even more closely related. The isolationists in the United States have long become outdated, and no one believes in the fallacy of glorious isolation anymore. Therefore, creating peace after the war is a common task for all countries in the world, especially the five major powers, which bear special responsibility for creating and maintaining world peace. However, the most important work in creating peace after the war is to draft the two peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The signing of these two peace treaties concerns the fate of all mankind and must be treated with special caution. Therefore, when the Big Three of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Potsdam in August 1945, they decided that China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should form a "Council of Foreign Ministers" to be responsible for drafting peace treaties with Germany and its vassal states. Later, when the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union met in Moscow to discuss the drafting of the peace treaty, the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States accommodated the Soviet Union and decided that the peace treaty should be drafted by the representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. However, the peace conference to discuss this peace treaty should still be convened by the "Council of Foreign Ministers" consisting of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Legally speaking, China should be an invited country to the German peace conference, which can be said to be beyond doubt. Furthermore, in terms of the actual situation, although China was unable to directly participate in the European theater and fight against Nazi Germany and its vassals due to its geographical environment during this war, it has always contained Japan, Germany's ally in the Far East, causing it to be mired in China and unable to provide effective assistance to Germany. It must be said that this is China's arduous contribution. Especially the Soviet Union, during the German-Soviet war, did not suffer the pain of being attacked on two fronts, and it cannot but know that this is due to China's strength in resisting Japan. We believe that Soviet political diplomats, as long as they are not prejudiced, are not unaware that China's resistance to Japan in the Far East is equivalent to assisting the Soviet Union in Europe in resisting Germany. But why today does the Soviet representative reject its ally China's participation in drafting the German peace treaty and deny its qualification as an invited country? Our Foreign Minister Wang, however, must express a different view from the United States, confirming that the Soviet Union, which only fought Japan for five or six days, must participate in the Japanese peace treaty. How can the Soviet Union be so arrogant and China so respectful!</p>
<p>Second, the diplomatic policy of the Chinese authorities after the war has always been to strive for the friendship of the Soviet Union, even at any cost, to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union. Even in any international conference, the Chinese representatives have consistently adopted an impartial policy. When the American and Soviet representatives had irreconcilable disputes, our representatives have never dared to offend the Soviet Union with a single word, and instead often acted as mediators, hoping to resolve the difficulties. For example, the United States and the Soviet Union had a great dispute over the veto power in the United Nations General Assembly. The Chinese representatives repeatedly proposed compromise plans to reconcile the views of both sides, in an attempt to reach an agreement. Furthermore, in the Far Eastern Commission, the United States and the Soviet Union often had disputes over the Korean issue. The Chinese representatives always wanted to be a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union to communicate the views of both sides so that the meeting would not be deadlocked. These facts are too numerous to mention. Even today, our country's attitude towards the Soviet Union is still very clear. As long as the Soviet Union can faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, our country is ultimately very willing to be friendly with the Soviet Union and has absolutely no prejudice or resentment. However, what does the Soviet Union answer to China?</p>
<p>Third, the Soviet Union often disregards our country's international status in international conferences and attempts to exclude our country from the list of invited countries. Many disputes have already occurred. For example, when the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers met in Paris in July last year and decided to convene the European Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov strongly argued and opposed China being an invited country to the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference. Although this unfriendly and almost insulting behavior of the Soviet Union made every Chinese person with self-esteem angry, our diplomatic authorities have always been cowardly and fearful. Not only have they not protested to the Soviet Union, but they have also adopted a consistent attitude of enduring humiliation in international conferences. This attitude of fearing and flattering the Soviet Union will not only make the Soviet Union look down on China even more, but will also cause other allied nations to laugh at it. For example, regarding the issue of convening the Japanese peace conference, the United States has repeatedly expressed its intention to exclude the Soviet Union and convene the Japanese peace conference alone. However, our country resolutely opposes any proposal for a peace treaty with Japan without the participation of the Soviet Union. Our Foreign Minister Wang even rashly stated in the United States: "If the Soviet government refuses to participate in the preliminary meeting of the Japanese peace treaty proposed by the United States, then China will reconsider its position on this matter." I wonder if Foreign Minister Wang's efforts to secure the Soviet Union's position in the Japanese peace conference can win the Soviet Union's favor and leave some room for China in the international arena?</p>
<p>Fourth, the post-war world has already created a situation of confrontation between two major blocs because the United States and the Soviet Union cannot work together to build world peace. Especially since the emergence of the new Communist International, the gap between the two major blocs has become increasingly deep. On the one hand, it has raised the banner of anti-imperialism and called on European countries to undermine the American aid plan to Europe. On the other hand, it has used anti-communism as a slogan and actively assisted other countries in resisting the invasion of foreign forces. At the same time, the "Cold War" currently underway between the United States and the Soviet Union is also intensifying. Soviet representatives often accuse American diplomats of being "warmongers." In the United States, the responsibility for the failure to build peace is attributed to the Soviet Union. Alas! China, standing as a third party, originally did not want to take sides in the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union's diplomatic style deliberately demonstrates against China. The more China retreats, the more arrogant the Soviet Union becomes. Whether the Soviet Union truly loves world peace cannot but make us greatly doubt it. And we, who are willing to be friends with the Soviet Union, cannot but express indignation at these scenes of facts being performed!</p>

<h3>Central Government Allocates 100 Billion to Replenish Grain Supply in North China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] In order to solve the grain problem in major cities in North China, the central government has approved a grain loan of 100 billion to encourage grain merchants to extensively purchase and transport food and flour from the production areas to the north. The quantity has also been increased to 300,000 bags per month, which will still be handled by the China Trust Bureau. Ling Zhibin, who went to Shanghai to report to Zhang Jia'ao and ask for instructions a few days ago, has returned to Tianjin from Shanghai after successfully completing the negotiations in the south and will arrive in Beiping on the 11th.</p>

<h3>Stores in Xiangtan and Jinshi Cities Restore the Use of Copper Coins: Rice Only Requires Three Coins per Liter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hengyang, 7th] Stores in Jinshi City have voluntarily restored the use of copper coins. Each 50-wen copper coin is worth 1,000 yuan in legal currency.

<h3>Guangdong and Jiangxi Border Will Launch Suppression and Hold Joint Defense Meeting Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] The security authorities of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces believe that the bandits in the border areas of Nanxiong, Dayu, and various counties in southern Jiangxi often take advantage of the relatively lax border defenses of the provinces. When suppressed in Jiangxi, they flee south into Guangdong, and when suppressed in Guangdong, they flee north into southern Jiangxi, making suppression very difficult. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a joint defense meeting of the two provinces in the middle of the month to suppress the bandits in the border areas. It is heard that the joint defense meeting will be held in Nanxiong, and Chairman Song will also allocate additional security forces to strengthen the strength of the eastern Guangdong defense forces. Furthermore, joint defense will also be held in counties such as Kaiping, Zhaoping, Wuzhou, and Xindu on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Huang Xuchu is scheduled to fly from Guilin to Guangzhou on the 13th to meet with Song Ziwen to discuss the suppression of bandits in the Guangdong-Guangxi border areas.</p>

<h3>The Unequaled Cotton Production of Shaanxi Province (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Hu Longchang, Xi’an News Agency</p>
<p>In the economy of Shaanxi Province, cotton production occupies a crucial position. The abundant cotton production of Shaanxi not only enriches the province's inherent economic capabilities, but also benefits the Longhai Railway—China's only east-west artery—and the counties and cities along its route, which were built upon cotton transport. When speaking of large-scale, high-quality cotton production, Shaanxi cotton is truly unrivaled domestically.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Shaanxi Province has a high and dry geology, fertile soil, moderate temperatures, and appropriate rainfall. These superior natural conditions, combined with the promotion of improved cotton seeds by human effort, have led to today's achievements. According to statistics, from 1934 to 1939, the cotton field area in Shaanxi Province remained between 3 and 4 million mu, with ginned cotton production around 1 million dan. The war halved both the area and the yield of ginned cotton. Starting last year, through continuous efforts, the cotton field area has expanded to 2,370,000 mu, and the ginned cotton production has increased to 711,000 dan. This year is even more promising. According to the second estimation report from the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the cotton field area has expanded to 3 million mu, with an expected ginned cotton production of 880,000 dan, closely approaching the peak figures of the pre-war era.</p>
<p>Nearly all of Shaanxi's cotton production now consists of improved American cotton varieties. Among these improved varieties, the main ones are "Tuozimian" from the southern Shaanxi area and "Sizimian" from the Guanzhong area. The former accounts for 10% of the area, with 300,000 mu planted, while the latter accounts for 90%, with 2.7 million mu planted. These cotton varieties are characterized by their long, fine fibers, mostly over one inch, and their pure quality, making them suitable for spinning fine yarns of 32 counts or higher.</p>
<p>Shaanxi's main cotton-producing areas are four: the Jingwei area, the eastern Shaanxi area, the western Shaanxi area, and the central Shaanxi area. Shaanxi's natural environment for cotton cultivation is excellent in every aspect, except for water scarcity. The Jingwei area, benefiting from the appropriate irrigation of the Jing and Wei rivers, accounts for one-third of the province's total cotton production. This area includes Jingyang, Sanyuan, and Gaoling counties. The eastern Shaanxi area includes Weinan, Lintong, Huaxian, Hejin, Chaoyi, and Dali counties. The western Shaanxi area includes Xianyang and Xingping counties. The central Shaanxi area is concentrated around Xi'an, and its production is also considerable.</p>
<p>The reporter personally visited the cotton fields in the Jingwei irrigation area. Although 80% of the cotton had already been harvested, the cotton fields still stretched endlessly for thousands of acres. Here, due to the appropriate amount of water, the height of the cotton stalks and the density of the branches and leaves are just right, so the cotton bolls are both large and numerous. An average cotton plant can yield around twenty cotton bolls. The Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Office is now actively further improving the "Sizimian" variety, and the number of cotton bolls per plant has already exceeded thirty. They have given this further improved cotton variety a patriotic name, calling it "Jingzimian."</p>
<p>Speaking of Shaanxi's achievements in cotton production today, everyone praises two Mr. Lis for their contributions to cultivation. One is the late water conservancy expert, Mr. Li Yishe, who built a water gate in the Jingwei area to irrigate the cotton fields with the Jing and Wei rivers. What was once barren land has now become a lush green landscape. The other is Mr. Li Guozhen, the current director of the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute and the Xi'an branch of the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. He is known as the "Cotton Bodhisattva" by the cotton farmers of Shaanxi. After graduating from the agricultural science department of National Central University in 1930, he returned to Shaanxi with Li Yishe, where he was in charge of the provincial agricultural cotton experiment field, starting the promotion of "Tuozimian" and the organization of marketing cooperatives. From 1936, he studied cotton industry at agricultural science universities such as those in California for three years. After returning to Shaanxi, he continued to work hard for the increased production of cotton in his hometown. He has been engaged in cotton improvement work for fifteen years. Mr. Li's contributions to the history of cotton production improvement and promotion in Shaanxi Province are undeniable. Mr. Li, simple and honest, repeatedly explained to the reporter the common misconceptions in the cotton market, indiscriminately classifying the high-quality Shaanxi Xingyang cotton as Henan cotton. In fact, Henan is in western Henan, and transportation has long been cut off, so no cotton has been shipped out for a long time. He urged the reporter to correct this in writing at all costs.</p>

<h3>Siamese Soldiers Suddenly Launch Coup d'état, Prime Minister Captured, Marshal Phibun Assumes Power, United States, Britain, and China Adopt Neutral Stance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 9th] Marshal Phibun Songkhram, leading the Siamese army, launched an armed coup d'état this morning, having already seized control of the Siamese government. Phibun immediately issued a proclamation to the people, declaring that he would recall capable administrative officials to serve and that the nation's shortcomings would be swiftly rectified. Phibun particularly urged the Chinese residing near the borders to remain calm and avoid causing trouble, asking them and other citizens to continue living and working as usual. Troops under Phibun's command have already taken control of all transportation equipment and radio stations in Bangkok. The diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, and China in Bangkok were notified of the impending coup d'état one hour before its launch. The diplomatic representatives of the three countries have maintained a completely neutral attitude during the incident. Traffic in Bangkok had completely returned to normal by evening, but strategically important locations were blockaded, and the number of people gathering on the streets was greater than usual. The people held hopeful attitudes, but there was no state of panic. It appears that Marshal Phibun has reached an understanding with Marshal Apun Songkhram, the commander-in-chief of the Siamese army, with Apun remaining in his original post. Phibun met with opposition party leaders this afternoon. When issuing lenient statements of assuming power, Phibun instructed all government officials to continue serving as usual, so all government agencies continue to operate as usual, only with some additional guards stationed. It should be noted that the Siamese government was originally led by Luang Thamrong, and most cabinet members were members of the People's Party and anti-Japanese resistance fighters. Marshal Phibun was the Prime Minister of Thailand during the Japanese occupation and declared war on the Allied forces in 1942. After Japan's defeat in 1945, he was placed under surveillance and was to be charged as a war criminal. However, in early 1946, three months after Siam and Britain signed a peace treaty that year, the Bangkok High Court ordered his release. Political figures believe that today's coup d'état will not affect the Siamese royal family. As of now, no official statement has been made regarding this coup. The U.S. and Chinese embassies have both declined to comment. Unofficial British sources suggest that this coup is purely a matter of domestic politics, but all sides believe that the military government after the coup will last for some time, and Phibun is expected to announce the new cabinet lineup tonight.</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun Reiterates Stance Against Outer Mongolia's Application to Join the UN, Soviet Representative Defends Outer Mongolia's Invasion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The Soviet Union stated in the Political Committee that Chinese troops invaded the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia in June of this year, and the Chinese representative engaged in a heated debate with the Soviet representative on the 8th.</p>
<p>Chinese representative Gu Weijun stated that this was completely false and that Soviet and Outer Mongolian armed forces had repeatedly crossed the Chinese border, invading Chinese territory and advancing to Baitashan, 100 li from the border. The Chinese government has lodged a strong protest with the Soviet and Mongolian governments, but has not yet received a reply. Gu opposed Soviet representative Gromyko's claim that Baitashan belonged to Outer Mongolian territory. It is said that Gromyko's statement was based on an old map from the Tsarist era, drawn in 1907 after Russia and Japan secretly divided their spheres of influence in Manchuria and Mongolia. Gu made the above remarks during the Political Committee's discussion on whether to request the Security Council to reconsider the rejection of the application of ten countries to join the UN. Gu stated that he would not allow Outer Mongolia to participate unless the country could change its policies and show a desire for peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 8th] Ambassador Gu Weijun declared in the UN Political Committee today that the Chinese delegation supports the recommendation that the Security Council not use its veto power in matters of membership application.</p>
<h3>Balkan Committee to Go to Greece to Execute Mission</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] Since the UN's eleven-member Balkan Committee was approved for establishment, the United States has appointed former ambassador to Belgium and minister to Luxembourg, Kirk, as its representative, and China, Mexico, and other countries have also appointed their representatives. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Athens on the 21st of this month and arrive in Thessaloniki on the 24th to set up its headquarters to carry out the mission of supervising peace in the Balkans.</p>
<h3>"Little Assembly" Plan Being Drafted in Political Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] Disregarding the opposition of the Soviet bloc, the UN Political Committee has established a subcommittee to draft a "Little Assembly" plan. If the Soviet Union withdraws from the United Nations, it is questionable whether this world organization will collapse. However, it is widely believed that the Soviet Union will not take this action. However, the "Little Assembly" proposal is likely to gain a majority vote in the General Assembly. The "Little Assembly" plan currently being drafted by the Political Committee is more moderate than the American proposal, but although this Little Assembly has no legislative power and cannot make any decisions, it will have a great influence on world opinion.</p>
<h3>Eleanor Roosevelt Criticizes Soviet Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th, United Press] In her "My Day" column, Eleanor Roosevelt criticized Soviet foreign policy, denouncing the Communist Party for fostering the idea that war is inevitable. In fact, the country that makes people believe that the actions of other countries will inevitably lead to war is the Soviet Union. I do not believe that the American people want war, but it is difficult to make the Soviet Union understand this point.</p>
<h3>McCormick to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Mr. and Mrs. McCormick, publishers of the Chicago Tribune, arrived here from Osaka on the 9th and will leave for Seoul on the morning of the 10th, departing for Shanghai on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Expected to End This Month, Committees Intensify Work, US and Soviet Union Seek Compromise on Holy Land Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 9th] The chairman of the UN Palestine Committee, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, stated that he would intensify the committee's work to finalize a resolution on the Palestine issue by the weekend. According to Evatt, he will convene a plenary session of the 57 member states on Tuesday morning and intends to continue the meetings without interruption until the final decision is made.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly President Aranha has sent a letter to the chairmen of each committee, asking them to try to complete their work within seven days. He suggested starting the meetings half an hour earlier each day and, if necessary, holding meetings at night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 8th] The small group formed by the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and Guatemala to seek a compromise on the proposals for implementing the plan to divide Palestine made by the United States and the Soviet Union had a long discussion today, but made little progress.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative promised to consider the proposal put forward by the Canadian representative, namely, that the General Assembly should elect a committee to implement the partition plan, but be responsible to the Security Council. Relevant parties believe that at this stage, it is not yet possible to predict whether the United States and the Soviet Union will accept this compromise proposal, because the US position is that the General Assembly rather than the Security Council should be responsible for the control of Palestine during the transition period. Canadian representative Pearson raised three major questions in the small group meeting: whether the United States and the Soviet Union can agree on the date of termination of the trusteeship; whether Britain and the Soviet Union can agree to the appointment of a committee by the General Assembly; and who will be responsible for local security before the establishment of an independent Palestinian state after the termination of the trusteeship. The representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union failed to express concrete opinions on these three key points at the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 8th] It is learned that the police in Berchtesgaden, at the request of the denazification court, have transferred Lieutenant General Meisel, who participated in the assassination of Field Marshal Rommel, the former commander of the German Africa Corps, by secret order of Hitler, to the court for trial. Although Meisel himself denied the matter, his documents have been submitted to the prosecutor for review.</p>
<h3>Truth of Hitler's Assassination of Roosevelt Revealed by Court</h3>
<p>Rommel died on October 14, 1944. After being wounded by American aircraft fire while supervising the war on the Western Front, his injuries had gradually recovered. Hitler granted him an estate and told him that if he committed suicide, he would receive a state funeral and his family would be spared punishment. Otherwise, he would be killed, because Hitler believed that Rommel was involved in the attempt to assassinate Hitler with a bomb in July 1940 and that Rommel's reputation was too high, which would be detrimental to him. According to Rommel's wife, Rommel was gradually recovering from his injuries at his home near Ulm. Meisel and Hitler's adjutant, General Burgdorf, suddenly visited Rommel's residence on October 14. After meeting with Rommel, they told Rommel's wife that Hitler had ordered Rommel to die within fifteen minutes and that they had brought poison, which would kill him three seconds after being taken. Rommel then left with Meisel and the others in the same car. Soon after, Rommel's wife received a telephone</p>
<p>announcement that her husband's body had been sent to the Ulm Hospital. After his death, Hitler ordered a state funeral for Rommel.</p>
<h3>Good Impression of Harriman Report in France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The French government has a good impression of the Harriman Committee's report, but is naturally disappointed that the amount of aid is less than that recommended at the Paris Conference. Generally speaking, it feels that this report has fully demonstrated its understanding of the European economic situation.</p>

<h3>Tone of the Street Corner Replaces Diplomatic Understanding, Anecdotes from the Second UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York Dispatch] At the historical international political conference, in addition to the fact that the representatives of various countries strive for truth, accuracy, and solid evidence in their speeches, theoretically and factually, they also pay special attention to their personal attitude when speaking, doing their best to be courteous, gentle, and elegant. It is better to be graceful and firm, with a smile hiding a knife, rather than being direct and blunt, losing etiquette and making a fool of oneself. Anyone with a little diplomatic experience can have such a graceful demeanor.</p>
<p>The situation at this second UN General Assembly broke all the conventions of past international conferences. Not only was it not gentle and elegant, but there was also verbal sparring. Some representatives even used vulgar terms from the streets in the conference hall to attack the speakers of the other side. On October 7, there was an unprecedented chaotic scene at the meeting of the Political and Security Committee discussing the Greek issue. Everyone scrambled to speak out of order, contradicting each other. Some pointed and shouted, others pounded the table, and some spoke again and again without the chairman's permission. In the Social, Human Rights, and Cultural Committee, some even shouted loudly, "The chairman cannot maintain order in the meeting, we should change the chairman."</p>
<p>The central figure in the chaotic situation in the Political and Security Committee was the Yugoslav representative, Bebler, a so-called revolutionary youth with black hair, intense emotions, and a beautiful appearance. He had a brilliant war record, and he distinguished himself during the Spanish Civil War and the Yugoslav resistance against the German army. He is currently the Secretary of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a capable talent of General Tito and Deputy Secretary of State Kardelj. He cannot restrain his emotions and is easily triggered. In the conference hall, he specializes in opposing Belgian representative Spaak, British representative McNair, and Luxembourg representative Beck. Spaak is known for his intelligence, agility, and quick thinking. McNair is courteous and good at rhetoric. Beck has gray hair and a gentlemanly demeanor. However, serving as the chairman of a subcommittee of the General Assembly is a thankless task.</p>
<p>Bebler has no shortage of allies. His most powerful helpers are the Soviet Union's chief representative, Vyshinsky, and Ukraine's representative, Manuilsky. Therefore, an invisible division into opposing factions has formed in the conference hall.</p>
<p>First, the representatives of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia insisted that the incident of the American propaganda "brewing war" must be continued to be discussed in the conference hall. When Bebler spoke, he used many rude terms such as "traitor", "executioner", and "rumormonger". Beck, as the chairman of the subcommittee, said: "In this conference hall, I cannot allow anyone to use such rude terms to insult the work of the United Nations and the members of the United Nations." Bebler immediately retorted, "If the chairman does not allow it, then I will use these terms without seeking the chairman's permission."</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman interrupted the Albanian representative's speech because he was disrupting the order of the conference hall. The Albanian representative said angrily: "I just want to explain my position." Before Chairman Beck could answer, Bebler loudly said: "I object to the chairman's rules of procedure and the order of the conference hall."</p>
<p>Beck said: "I ask the Yugoslav representative to repeat the sentence attacking me just now."</p>
<p>Bebler really repeated it again and said: "I think the chairman should not interrupt the Albanian representative before he finishes speaking."</p>
<p>Beck said: "The Albanian representative is just repeating the opinions that he has already stated before. I cannot accept Mr. Bebler's criticism." At this time, Vyshinsky immediately stood up to speak for Bebler: "The chairman should give the Albanian representative a chance to finish his speech."</p>
<p>The chairman had to ask all the attending representatives to vote on whether to agree with the criticism of the chairman by the Yugoslav or Soviet representative.</p>
<p>McNair disagreed with the opinions of the Yugoslav and Soviet representatives. He said: "It is best to vote. It is very important that all representatives respect the chairman. More importantly, if we cannot accept the chairman's rules of procedure, then we don't have to come to participate in the discussion of world affairs at all. Chairman, we are very grateful to you because you have handled it very appropriately."</p>
<p>As a result of the vote, everyone unanimously supported Beck, and no one opposed him. They were speechless.</p>
<p>Then, Chairman Beck asked the Albanian representative what he wanted to say. He replied: "I have not prepared to say anything in advance, and I have nothing to add at this moment."</p>
<p>A disturbance was quelled.</p>
<p>At the third subcommittee meeting on October 7, the issue of whether the case of Vyshinsky's proposal to the General Assembly on September 18, that the American "war-mongers and fascist propaganda" should be dealt with, should be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion and submitted to the International Conference on Freedom of the Press for evaluation, was voted down by thirty-three votes to seven, but the order of the meeting was greatly disrupted.</p>
<p>When everyone was arguing without getting anywhere, Dr. Zhang Pengchun pointed out that what we are discussing now is whether we should submit this "propaganda" issue to the General Assembly for discussion (To recommend or not to recommend). It is not necessary to discuss the issue itself in this meeting. British representative Davies also agreed. Who knew that this immediately led to another argument from the Yugoslav representative, Metz, who said: "To be or not to be is a famous quote from Shakespeare. We are now meeting at the United Nations, not taking an English class, so there is no need to use this famous quote." In the eyes of the general audience, this was clearly quibbling and arguing for no reason.</p>
<p>In the end, the order was very chaotic. The representative of Argentina pounded the table and said: "This is too outrageous...too chaotic. We should change the chairman."</p>
<p>A group of experienced diplomats and journalists who have attended many international conferences believe that the blatant and rude terms used by Eastern European countries are unprecedented in international history, and they also believe that these new revolutionaries do not emphasize reason, but emphasize emotion. Even very rational remarks must be expressed in a loud voice and with forceful fists.</p>
<p>Some people said humorously: He walked into the conference room of the UN General Assembly, thinking that he had mistakenly walked into a teahouse. Some said: The current site of the UN General Assembly is at "Lake Success", but when you arrive at the conference hall, you can neither see the "lake" nor find "success."

<h3>The Weather is Cold and the Year-End is Near, Endless Difficult Problems, People on Tianmu Road Anxious, District Representatives Hold Congress, Request Postponement of House Demolitions</h3>
<p>After the City Council passed the Tianmu Road widening and house demolition issue, to be implemented in phases within six months, the Bureau of Public Works has decided to start construction on the 15th of this month. District residents in the North Railway Station area, in order to request the authorities to postpone the implementation, specially convened a district residents' congress at the North District National School on Kangle Road at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss solutions. First, Chairman Yu Bingwen reported the significance of the meeting. Then, Li Muyun, a 71-year-old resident representative of Tianmu Road, made a passionate speech, saying: Residents are facing demolition in the midst of a severe housing shortage, and are very anxious. With the year-end approaching, problems such as children losing their schooling, factories settling accounts, and workers being laid off and unemployed are all very worrying. Subsequently, district representatives expressed their opinions one after another. Finally, it was decided to petition the City Council, the Municipal Government, and relevant sectors in the name of the District Residents' Congress, earnestly requesting a postponement of six months, to implement phased house demolition and relocation after April 15 next year, and requesting the cancellation of the Bureau of Public Works' mandatory execution order of November 15. Also yesterday, residents along Tianmu Road posted slogans such as: "A house requires a gold bar, we don't even have an iron bar", "Today we live in peace and work, tomorrow we will be displaced", "The mayor is our parent official, how can parents sit idly by and let their children freeze and starve", and so on.</p>
<h3>Light Bulbs Temporarily Allowed to be Imported, Guild Requests Correction, Hu Xiyuan Expresses Opinions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance transferred a regulation from the Ministry of Economic Affairs ordering the Jianghai Customs to temporarily allow the import of light bulbs of 100 volts to 120 volts and 210 volts to 230 volts. According to Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the Electrical Equipment Industry Association of the Third District, the above-mentioned argon bulbs can all be manufactured by domestic companies, and the combined production volume can exceed 50,000 units per day, which is sufficient to supply domestic use. Moreover, with the current practice of saving electricity everywhere, there is already a surplus of argon bulbs. Once foreign goods are allowed to be imported again, the impact on sales will be even greater. The government should temporarily allow the import of foreign argon bulbs of 500 volts or more, which would be more reasonable. The guild has made reasonable representations to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, requesting correction.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Candidate Chen Peide Announces Political Platform</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Senator Chen Peide (pictured) is running for the National Assembly. Yesterday, he issued the following statement outlining his political platform: He has always been involved in the labor movement, coming from the people. If given the opportunity, he wishes to represent the people in urging the government to achieve the following: Implement democratic politics, ensuring all political measures aim to enhance the welfare of the people. Construct a greater Shanghai, revitalize social enterprises, ensuring all Shanghai citizens can live and work in peace. Eliminate social vices, eradicate ignorance, eliminate poverty and filth, and promote thrift. Vigorously promote tax reduction to foster the development of industry and commerce, thereby reducing the burden on the people. Encourage production, stabilize prices, and ensure people's livelihoods. Mr. Chen is currently 55 years old, a graduate of Jiangnan College. Twenty years ago, he stood up against a foreign-owned cigarette factory's refusal to pay taxes, seeing it as a matter of national sovereignty. He courageously led the factory workers in a strike as a warning, ultimately forcing the factory to comply and pay national taxes. During the War of Resistance, he served as a director of the first session of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement and as a director of the National Workers' Anti-Enemy Support Association. After the victory, he served as a reorganization committee member and head of the propaganda section of the Shanghai General Labor Union and is currently a standing committee member of the 29th District Party Headquarters and a Shanghai City Senator.</p>
<h3>Yizhong Cigarette Factory Cured Tobacco Department Labor Dispute Temporarily Concludes</h3>
<p>Workers at the British-owned Yizhong Cigarette Factory were dissatisfied because the factory calculated wages based on a six-day week, uniformly discounting them by 25%. They made two demands to the company: Workers should be paid in full for days worked, with days off calculated at a 75% rate. Wages should be paid for Sundays in accordance with the Factory Act. The company did not accept these conditions, and the factory's labor union directly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The bureau convened representatives from both labor and management some days ago for negotiations, which failed to reach an agreement, and further mediation is scheduled for the coming days. Furthermore, the workers in the cured tobacco department of the factory previously demanded the factory reinstate dismissed workers and establish a workers' welfare association, leading to friction. The workers collectively slept in the factory workshop as a protest. Now, after persuasion by officials from the Social Affairs Bureau, the workers have accepted the advice and left the factory. The Social Affairs Bureau has notified the factory to resume work first, and all issues will be mediated in the coming days.</p>
<h3>One Day of Overtime on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday to Donate to Build General Labor Union Headquarters</h3>
<p>Regarding the fundraising for the construction of a new headquarters for the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Third Plenary Congress of the union previously passed a resolution that workers in all factories in the city would donate their overtime wages earned on the 12th of this month, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday, as a fund. It is also reported that the union has received approval from the Social Affairs Bureau to issue a notice to all factories to work one day of overtime and deduct the wages on their behalf. The union has also scheduled a meeting of the board of directors this morning to actively discuss the matter. In the afternoon, the first meeting of the New Headquarters Construction Committee and the Construction Fund Management Committee will be held.</p>

<h3>Clarify Suspicion, Why Take Your Own Life? Guanghua University Student's Suicide Note Regrets Two Instances of Confusion</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Around 4:00 PM on the 8th, a young man arrived at the Jinshan Hotel on Hankou Road, booked room 506 under the pseudonym Zhang Zhengming. At 7:00 PM, he called the tea server and asked him to buy food and rice. After eating, he closed the door and went to sleep. Around 10:00 AM the next morning, the room's call bell rang. The early shift tea server, Zhang Zhiqing, went in to inquire. The young man replied that nothing was wrong and said he still wanted to sleep. By noon, there was no movement in the room, and the tea server became suspicious. He entered the room and saw the young man lying on the bed, his face pale, his expression vague, not saying a word. Realizing something was wrong, he urgently reported to the front desk and called an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He died en route.</p>
<p>(Picture: Wan Jiasan, who committed suicide)</p>
<p>Stolen Suit, Suspected Expulsion</p>
<p>After the fact, the Jinshan Hotel reported the situation to the Old Gate Police Branch. Chief Jiang ordered officer Zhang Kuidong to rush to investigate. It was learned that the deceased's real name was Wan Jiasan, a second-year student in the economics department of Guanghua University, a native of Suzhou, 23 years old. He had taken sleeping pills due to minor stimulation and committed suicide. A search of the room revealed an empty bottle of American-made sleeping pills in his bag, along with five suicide notes addressed to Mayor Wu, Director Yu, his father Wan Mengquan, his uncle Wang Jianying, and classmate Zhu Zhong. The suicide notes revealed that his father was a section chief in the Jiangxi Postal Administration, and his uncle Wang Jianying lived at 36 Shenyuli, Tiantong Road in this city. The investigating police officers summoned Wang Jianying to inquire about Wan's recent situation. Wang stated that recently, a classmate at school had a suit stolen, along with 480,000 yuan in legal tender. After the director of student affairs conducted a room-by-room inspection in the dormitory, a bottle of cod liver oil pills was found near Wan, leading to suspicions that he was the thief. Later, Wang received a notice from the school stating that Wan was suffering from acute orchitis and requesting someone to go to him (Wan's Shanghai address was Wang's residence). Wang rushed over immediately and learned that Wan was not sick but had been accused of theft and ordered to withdraw from school. Wan must have been angered by this and resorted to such a measure, taking poison to end his life, and so on. The suicide notes are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Mayor, Detailed Account</p>
<p>Letter to Mayor Wu: The gist of the letter is: "I am a student at Guanghua University named Wan Jiasan, 23 years old, from Suzhou. I have done two foolish things in the past. Because of this, I am forced to die, but I am being wronged. So, in order to be cleared after death, I am daring to write to the mayor, please investigate this incident thoroughly. I will now write down the process: Last semester, I mistakenly wore a khaki American military pants belonging to a classmate named Liu. This semester, because the school's food was not good, I secretly took a bottle of vitamins belonging to a classmate and was discovered. Therefore, this time, when the school's classmates had a suit and cash stolen, they forced me to admit that I was the thief and forced me to write a letter of compensation. Then why did I write that letter of compensation? Because I already had these two stains, who would believe me even if I explained it repeatedly? Moreover, at that time, the classmates were all convinced that I was a thief, and the situation was so unfavorable to me. Furthermore, Director Chen, Wen Lihu, and classmate Yang Baoqiu threatened me with police beatings. I was afraid that if it really blew up, I would definitely suffer immediate losses and be humiliated by my classmates. If it was published in the newspaper, my reputation would definitely be affected first, and my father would be angered to death. So I gritted my teeth and wrote that letter of compensation, but at that time, I did say that I could pay compensation, but I did not admit to stealing the suit and cash.</p>
<p>Please Order a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Now the school thinks I am a big thief and orders me to drop out. How can I face people in the future? How can I have the face to go home? So I decided to commit suicide, but this is not to avoid punishment, but because I feel that it is too difficult to clarify. Therefore, I am submitting a petition to Your Excellency, please order a thorough investigation of this case and find out the truth, so that I can die in peace. I think that with the Shanghai detective force, I will definitely find out who stole this suit and cash? If I know after death, I will be grateful." (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Letter to Director Yu: Briefly stated: "After my death, I hope the police will use the latest scientific methods to thoroughly investigate who stole the suit and cash from our school." (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Letter to Father: "Because of a moment of foolishness, I did two foolish things, which led to today's result. Uncle will tell you all the details."</p>
<p>Letter to Uncle and Aunt: "You two treat me so well, just like your own son, which makes the younger generation extremely grateful. This dishonorable thing happened, and I really have no face to see people."</p>
<p>Letter to Classmate Zhu Zhong: "I am so sorry for bothering you all night last night. In the future, when the police investigate, the truth will definitely come out. I died cleanly. If I know after death, I will be grateful to you."</p>
<h3>Young Police Officers Were Insulted; Gained Much Experience During Internship; Will Not Be Polite When Officially On Duty</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first batch of 40 young police officers in this city received more than three weeks of special training at the Caohejing Municipal Children's Education and Training Center. Once all the uniforms are prepared, they will officially begin appearing on the streets to perform their duties today and tomorrow. The work undertaken by these young police officers is threefold: To persuade frugality in various restaurants. To organize traffic and maintain order at tram and bus stops. To inspect unlicensed dance halls. (This task will be performed in coordination with female police officers selected from the Girl Scouts after they have completed their training.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhou Zuwang, the director of the Children's Education and Training Center, invited newspaper reporters to visit Caohejing. In order to know how the young police officers' training was progressing, at the request of the reporters, he first asked them to do a simulation. During lunch, the reporters pretended to be restaurant patrons, and a team of young police officers ran forward to conduct inspections. Assuming that the food used had violated the regulations on frugality for banquets, the leader of the young police officers politely asked who the host of the table was and explained to the host that the dishes had exceeded the regulations, and set out the reasons for vigorously promoting frugality, persuading them not to violate the regulations again in the future. The host might have brushed them off or thought that they had plenty of money and it was none of their business. The other guests at the table also helped to speak, but the young police officers still politely explained one by one, persuading them to be frugal, deeply moving those who received the advice.</p>
<p>This kind of work of persuading frugality at banquets is not easy to please. During the training period, batches of young police officers also went out to various major restaurants to practice. Many diners had stubborn attitudes. One diner took a contemptuous attitude and joked: "Little brother, you haven't even eaten this kind of dish before!" One diner pointed to foreign wine as domestic wine, and because the police officer was young and didn't understand, he was confused. It was in the internship that the young police officers gained a lot of experience. In the future, when they officially perform their duties, if diners deliberately insult them, they will immediately report to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>The uniforms of the young police officers are similar to the uniforms of the US Navy, except that the hats are the same as the current police officers. The uniforms are made of Melton wool, with white belts, black leather shoes, and white shoe covers. The left collar has the team number, and the right collar has the letters YP (Young Man Police). There are two police pigeons under the collar. The left arm has the Young Police Officer armband, and there is a police whistle ribbon across the chest, which is very heroic.</p>
<p>This group of fifteen or sixteen-year-old youths were mostly street urchins and needy children who lacked food and clothing in the past. After education and training, they will appear in front of you today with a new look that will surprise you. With a loyal attitude, they will perform their duties for the country. (The attached picture shows young police officers performing an inspection while reporters are eating.)</p>
<h3>Request to Waive Prohibition on Teaching Arts; 22 Training Institutes; Four Reasons</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Twenty-two dance arts training institutes in this city recently believed that the authorities, after banning the business of dance halls on a regular basis, also decided to prohibit the teaching of dancing, believing that this move was a case of "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." Therefore, it was decided that five representatives would be dispatched to the City Council, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Government this morning to petition for the revocation of the order. The reasons they held are as follows: "Dance arts training institutes do not sell tea or tickets, which is not contrary to the original purpose of frugality. The Department of Physical Education of the National Central University of Nanjing has recently adopted books published by dance arts training institutes as teaching materials. In diplomatic social occasions, whether international or private, if one does not know dancing at all, one will inevitably be ridiculed. Dance arts training institutes have been in Shanghai for more than 20 years, and there are thousands of people who directly or indirectly rely on teaching dance for a living."</p>

<h3>Home for Working Women, YWCA Dormitory: Full of Warmth and Joy</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On the Yuanmingyuan Road, lined with tall buildings, near the end of Suzhou Creek, stands a faded red brick three-story building. Surrounded by magnificent architecture, it looks rather humble. However, within its old walls, it is full of youthful vitality, overflowing with warmth and joy, songs and laughter. This small building is the famous Home for Working Women, the Shanghai YWCA dormitory.</p>
<p>Living in this dormitory are forty-four single professional women who are far from their families. They come from all over the country, mostly between the ages of twenty and thirty, with at least a high school education. Their professions are mainly civil servants, bank clerks, postal workers, and nurses, teachers, but there are also outstanding individuals who are university professors or female architects.</p>
<p>Like a Harmonious Large Family</p>
<p>Because they have similar intellectual levels and are all single women far from their families, although they come from different cities or villages with different customs and habits, and each engages in different occupations, even with absolutely different personalities, they easily understand each other and easily develop close friendships. Every evening, they successively return from work. Just seeing the kind smiles of their companions and many caring inquiries makes them feel warm comfort. Every dinner time, girls from different rooms gather in a dining room, and there is unconstrained talk and laughter on each table, just like a harmonious large family. In the evening, some read, some play the piano, some sing. The sound of the piano and songs are accompanied by light laughter. These songs and laughter dilute their heavy homesickness. They return to the innocent golden age of girls. After a bell rings, everyone falls silent, preparing to go to sleep, until the wake-up bell the next morning startles them from their sweet dreams. Everyone greets each other, saying, "Good morning!" "Morning!" While busily washing and dressing, they each begin a day's work. After nine o'clock every morning, the dormitory is once again in an empty mood.</p>
<p>Never Any Unpleasant Incidents</p>
<p>The management of the dormitory is quite strict. Male guests can only go as far as the reception room. Lights are to be turned off at 10:30 every night, and the front door will be locked. Unless the young ladies have special matters to declare in advance, otherwise they will be turned away. Although this is inconvenient for some young ladies who are in love, they all know how to abide by the rules. According to Ms. Hua, the officer in charge of management, no unpleasant incidents have ever occurred in the dormitory.</p>
<p>The monthly dormitory fee, including breakfast and dinner, is only 600,000 yuan this month, which can be said to be very economical for working-class ladies. If the payday is not far away, and money is tight for the time being, it can be accommodated for a few days. Therefore, most of the young ladies never leave after moving in, unless they get married, go abroad, or change jobs. The proportion of people who get married is very small. From the time the dormitory opened in March last year to the present, in more than a year, only four or five young ladies have left due to marriage.</p>
<p>Hoping to Expand the Scope of the Dormitory</p>
<p>Many working women aspire to this "large family" dormitory, but cannot be accommodated due to limited places. Up to now, more than a hundred people have registered with the YWCA. Every day, several girls from afar come to visit the dormitory officer, telling of their plight of having no home to go to. The YWCA now only hopes to use the power of society to expand the scope of the dormitory, and to accommodate as many sisters as possible who are serving society away from their hometowns, allowing them to find rest and warmth in simple and quiet residences.</p>

<h3>Another Beautiful Corpse in Fuzhou: A Bride Commits Suicide by Drowning Three Days After Marriage</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Fuzhou, 6th] A graduate of Wenshan Girls' High School in Fuzhou, 24 years old, named 　　　, is a native of Fuzhou. Her mother died early, and her father is serving in the military in Guangxi. She lived with her aunt since childhood. In August of this year, her aunt acted as a matchmaker and arranged for her to be engaged to Li Hongchi, a merchant from Songchun at No. 48 Yanping Road in this city. Li is 28 years old, does business in Shanghai, and has a wealthy family. His wife died by suicide by jumping into the sea in April of this year due to some reason. After becoming engaged to Miss Zheng, he was eager to marry her. With the consent of both parents, the wedding was held in Fuzhou on October 28. On the second night of the marriage, the bride suddenly cried out in her dream, frightening the groom, saying: She dreamed of a terrifying woman with disheveled hair, sitting sadly on the edge of the bed, and told the groom the woman's clothing and condition in the dream. The next morning, the groom showed her the deceased's photo. Miss Zheng said: It was indeed like her, but since she believed in Christ, she didn't take it to heart. Li was afraid of being haunted by ghosts, so he enshrined his ex-wife's portrait in the room. On the first of this month, the woman returned to Ningde to visit her 96-year-old grandmother at her mother's home. At about 7 o'clock that evening, she brought two boxes of Western-style pastries and returned to her husband's house alone. Unexpectedly, she suddenly felt uneasy on the way, and wandered along the roadside in Wangzhuang. Because her clothing was beautiful, she was seen by a nearby farmer, who suspected her and asked, "Why don't you go home?" The woman ignored her. After that, no one knew where the woman went.</p>
<p>After his wife returned to Ningde, the husband waited until the next day and did not see her return, so he sent someone to inquire at his wife's home. They returned and said that the woman had already gone out. Her husband inquired everywhere, but found no trace of her. At first, he suspected that the woman had eloped. After a day passed, her husband found one of the leather shoes she was wearing under the Twelve Bridges near Wangzhuang, so he determined that the woman must have committed suicide by drowning. He hired workers to salvage the body, but after two days, he still found nothing. Until yesterday morning, the corpse finally floated up and was discovered by the villagers, who fished it out and notified her husband to collect and bury it. As for the gold chain, gold ring, gold bracelet and other ornaments worn on the woman's body, her husband gave them to the villagers as a reward. (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu)</p>

<h3>To Prevent Price Fluctuations, Authorities Plan to Expand the Scope of Rationing</h3>
<p>After the news that the United States has not yet made a concrete decision on loans to China, those who rely on foreign aid feel greatly disappointed, and speculators take the opportunity to absorb goods in the market. In addition, the long-standing tight money supply gives them good opportunities for activities, resulting in price stability that has lasted for a considerable period of time, and price movements are showing signs of activity again. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this. It is reported that after Mayor Wu returns to work after his leave, he will resume holding economic inspection meetings within a few days. The Economic Section of the Police Department has decided to carry out investigations in order to prevent the spread of rising prices. It will investigate whether there are any acts of manipulation and deliberate price increases in various markets. Because at this time of price stability and supply-demand balance, there should be no more rising prices! If there are fluctuations, it is clear that someone is causing trouble, so it is decided to strictly crack down on them. In particular, the black market for gold and banknotes must be completely eliminated to eradicate this bad phenomenon. At the same time, the relevant authorities have decided to implement the rationing of briquettes, cloth, sugar, and cooking oil as scheduled. They are also planning to expand the scope of rationing to reduce the burden on civil servants and citizens.</p>
<p>Farmers Bank Releases Agricultural Loans for the First Half of the Year</p>
<p>According to the Farmers Bank, the agricultural loans issued by the bank in the first half of this year have reached 206.5 billion yuan. Among them, agricultural production loans are the most, accounting for more than 57%, about 119 billion yuan. The second is agricultural product transportation and marketing loans, accounting for slightly less than 17%, and rural sideline business loans are the second, accounting for slightly more than 9%. Farmland water conservancy loans accounted for slightly more than 8%, emergency loans for the recovered areas accounted for slightly more than 1%, agricultural extension loans accounted for slightly more than 4%, and resettlement area loans accounted for slightly less than 2%. All the above-mentioned loans do not include the Northeast circulating currency portion.</p>
<p>In addition, special agricultural product loans are a special type of loan organized by the bank to assist in the processing and manufacturing of special products in various [Blank], improve quality, and facilitate transportation. In the first half of this year, more than 400 billion yuan in silkworm silk loans were issued. Cotton loans issued 136.6 billion yuan. Tobacco leaf loans issued more than 28 billion yuan. Tea industry loans issued more than 81 billion yuan. Due to the limited scope of fishery loans to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the loans were only 10 billion yuan. In addition, emergency loans in various disaster areas were also numerous. 100 billion yuan in loans have been approved for the Yellow Flood Area, and 20 billion yuan has been issued. 3.9 billion yuan has also been issued in the Huai Flood Area. The bank plans to issue a total of 900 billion yuan in various loans this year. In addition to those issued in the first half of the year, the remaining amount will be issued continuously by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Raw Material Supply Falls Short of Demand, Wool Spinning Outlook is Bleak</h3>
<p>The city's Wool and Flannel Spinning, Weaving and Dyeing Industry Association currently has 61 members, including 11 full-fledged factories (spinning, weaving, and dyeing), 5 spinning and weaving velour yarn and weaving hiberolon each. There are 3 spinning coarse yarn, and the rest only have weaving equipment. There are approximately 7,000 workers, with the largest factory having approximately 800 workers and the smallest having a dozen or so. Although there is no precise estimate of output, the average is approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yards per month. If all the factories are operating, output can be doubled, then the monthly raw material requirement requires approximately US$3.5 million in foreign exchange, a total of US$10.5 million per quarter. According to the current limited allocation, the proportion is only one-fifth. In order to maintain the livelihood of workers, manufacturers with slightly thicker funds do not hesitate to collect raw materials from the market to make up for the shortage. Unfortunately, inventories are not large and supply cannot meet demand. Wool is currently valued at 240,000 yuan per pound, and high-quality combed wool has risen to more than 400,000 yuan. Those with weak funds have switched to operating in shifts, or have stopped completely, or have switched to using flying cotton as a substitute.</p>
<p>According to the association, the state-owned Textile Construction Company accounts for 28% of the foreign exchange allocated, foreign merchants account for 16%, and factories in other cities account for 19%, while private factories in this city account for only 37%.</p>
<p>In the past, the association's method of allocating foreign exchange to member factories stipulated that old factories would be calculated based on 300% of the number of operating spindles, and new factories would be one-third of that proportion. If a new factory started operating in the last month of the quarterly allocation, its allocation would only be one-ninth. At that time, disputes arose between the two parties. The association's reason was that the foreign exchange given by the government in the first quarter was 1.4 million yuan, and then it was 2 million yuan, and the amount of increase was one-third, so the amount allocated to new factories should only be limited to this amount. The new factories believed that absorbing idle funds into production was in line with national policy. A factory has huge expenses at the beginning of its establishment and cannot afford to purchase raw materials on the market. What they hoped for was that the association would uphold fairness, that is, equal opportunities and equal distribution, and not favor one over the other, creating discrimination. The former has become the past, and the latter should be re-solved reasonably.</p>

<p>Guangdong is one of the most prosperous regions for the silk industry in China, but there has been little improvement after the war. At this time when export efforts are being sought, it is difficult to expect recovery unless improvements are made quickly. Mr. Ge Jingzhong, manager of the China Silk Company, in view of this, went to Shunde to inspect and based on his inspection, formulated an improvement plan. It is reported that the main points of its plan are roughly as follows: In the coming year, the supply of improved spring silkworm seeds to Guangdong Province will be increased to 20,000 to 30,000 sheets.

<h3>Rice from Siam Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Our ordered 20,000 tons of white rice from Siam, the first batch is already being loaded onto ships there. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month, and the rest will be shipped within the month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittances Decrease Daily</h3>
<p>If the black market is not eradicated in a day, overseas remittances cannot return to normal.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Overseas Department of the Bank of China, overseas remittances have been decreasing daily recently, with the daily amount remitted being minimal. Previously, every time the Central Bank adjusted the exchange rate, overseas remittances did increase in the first month after the adjustment, but gradually decreased after one month. When the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee was established, overseas remittances increased, with weekly income of approximately 5 billion legal currency. Currently, due to the continuous rise of the black market, which is almost 40% higher than the market price, overseas remittances are decreasing daily under these circumstances. There are rumors that the Central Bank will set another exchange rate specifically to attract overseas remittances, but this is unlikely. The current focus on attracting overseas remittances remains on eradicating the black market. If the black market is not eradicated in a day, overseas remittances will definitely not be able to maintain normalcy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Securities Transaction Regulations to be Thoroughly Revised</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 9th dispatch] According to informed sources who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, the future Tokyo Securities Exchange will use the San Francisco Securities Exchange as a model. They stated: The Allied Headquarters insists that the regulations and most of the details of Japan's planned central exchange must be based on the major exchanges on the US West Coast. In order to facilitate the establishment of the new Tokyo Securities Exchange in accordance with the regulations of the Allied Headquarters, the new Securities Transaction Regulations passed in February of this year must be thoroughly revised.</p>
<h3>Before Trademark Examination is Approved, Factories Can Produce Based on Payment Receipts</h3>
<p>The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly issued a public notice stating that commodities with registered trademarks must be approved with an examination certificate before being allowed to leave the factory with unified tax. In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the bureau had previously temporarily allowed verification of the application for registration payment receipt, tax payment and sales, and instructed compliance. Now, it is feared that manufacturers in various places may not be fully aware, so it is jointly announced again that all taxable commodities, such as cigarettes, matches, wine, etc., and other items, during the trademark registration process, before the examination certificate is issued, will be verified based on the application registration payment receipt, and will be temporarily allowed to pay taxes and sell products, and the examination certificate will be presented later. In addition to instructing all provincial and municipal tax authorities under the jurisdiction of the bureau to comply, all manufacturers are also informed.</p>
<h3>Alleviating Raw Material Panic in the Match Industry, Import Management to Relax Quotas</h3>
<p>The panic over raw materials in the match industry is very serious, and the foreign exchange quota for raw material imports is far from sufficient. Therefore, the industry previously submitted a petition to the Import Management Committee and the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and other agencies. It is now learned that the Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee has yesterday replied to the Industrial Association and the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, etc., agreeing to appropriately relax the foreign exchange quota for raw materials for the match industry starting from the fourth quarter, in order to solve the panic over match raw materials.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox: "Scalper Organizations" Abound in Pudong Riverside</h3>
<p>A letter from a reader of this newspaper in Fuzhou exposes illegitimate demands.</p>
<p>In the Bund and the 16th Pier area of this city, there are many "travel agencies" whose business is to purchase ship tickets from various shipping companies and then resell them to passengers. The price is often higher than the face value. General passengers often endure and buy because they are in a hurry. It is heard that many poor compatriots, because they are displaced in Shanghai and eager to return home, are being blackmailed by these "travel agencies," with no room for negotiation. Furthermore, because they absorb a large number of tickets, they create a "ticket shortage" situation, thereby satisfying their desire for extortion. If the authorities allow these disguised "scalper" organizations to run rampant, passengers will suffer endlessly. Mr. Xu Huiping, a reader of this newspaper, recently sent a letter from Fuzhou, mentioning this matter. It is hereby published, hoping that the relevant authorities will pay attention to it to reassure travelers. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Editor Guang Sheng: On September 14th, I took the "Nanshan" ship from Shanghai to Rong. On the ship, I happened to meet Zhang Yongzeng and Guan Huaizhen, two families (12 people, including 8 children) of refugees from Xuezhuang Township, Linyi County, Shandong Province, who came to Rong for survival. They were introduced by the "Shanghai Zhonghua Travel Agency" at 148 Zhongshan East 2nd Road in Shanghai to take the ship. They were forced to pay 135,000 yuan per ticket. These poor refugees could not afford this huge sum, and repeatedly pleaded for a reduction, but were not allowed. Finally, they sold several pieces of winter clothing to raise a total of 1,080,000 yuan. Later, the agency sent someone to lead them onto the ship and took 2,000 yuan per person for car fare and ferry fare, totaling 32,000 yuan. The ship did not provide meals. When I learned about this, I immediately inquired with the ship's comprador, who said: "Only 40,000 yuan per person was received from the agency leader, totaling 320,000 yuan, and the ship has free preferential treatment for refugees and veterans. The huge sum they paid was obviously embezzled by the agency." Everyone was indignant. After arriving in Rong, I specifically sent a letter to the "Shanghai Zhonghua Travel Agency" to inquire and asked them to return the remaining money to the refugees (they now live in the Rong Electric Company's new factory). Unexpectedly, more than a month has passed, and the agency has ignored it.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Zhonghua Travel Agency" was originally a service organization and should sincerely serve the public and take fair profits. Especially for the poor, it should do its best to serve them. Now, the agency not only fails to fulfill its service duties, but instead takes the opportunity to defraud refugees, disregard the law, damage the business ethics of the industry, and corrupt the good social atmosphere, causing anger and indignation. In addition to reporting the facts to the relevant authorities for investigation, I am sending the facts to your newspaper for publication, so that people in society can use the sympathy of human justice to warn the unscrupulous elements of the agency, in order to deter others from following suit. Sincerely, Reader Xu Huiping, October 20th.</p>

<h3>The Merits and Demerits of Science</h3>
<p>— Steel Man</p>
<p>Science is like a bright and shining light, illuminating the path of humanity.</p>
<p>Since humanity began its struggle to conquer nature, the progress of world civilization has been invaluable.</p>
<p>People hundreds of years ago, or even just decades ago, could never have imagined today's world and the happiness it enjoys.</p>
<p>However, the jealousy, narrow-mindedness, and suspicion of humankind, those vile characteristics, have not been completely eliminated. Mad war-makers often bring about cruel catastrophes.</p>
<p>Here, unfortunately, rapidly advancing science, the driving force of human civilization, is controlled by evil hands to harm humanity. Science becomes the tool of criminals and the assistant of evildoers. People who do not deeply understand science cannot help but doubt and criticize it.</p>
<p>In fact, if we quietly look back at the past and present reality and examine them, we can see that this view is one-sided.</p>
<p>The radiation rays that were worried about becoming killing "death rays" have become important tools for studying various sciences and treating diseases today. The gunpowder that was a "war tool" is now a necessity for building large and small dams. Atomic energy is a huge source of power. And who would still want to live in dark, unlit nights and endure suffering from diseases? And what ultimately brought victory to the democratic countries with freedom and equality? Undoubtedly, it is the credit of scientific progress.</p>
<p>The latest two reports on ultrasonic waves are the clearest illustration. It is an interesting story.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic waves are what bats rely on to fly in the dark, and what humans use as the "invisible fingers" to touch the moon.</p>
<p>A wave that cannot be heard or seen. Now it is no longer something that no one cares about.</p>
<p>At the graduation ceremony of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, the invited speaker, US Air Force General George Kenney, talked about the mystery of this wave.</p>
<p>Ultrasonic waves may be a terrible tool when humans want to wage war again. In today's era of advancing science, it may not be alarmist. An aircraft equipped with "ultrasonic sensing equipment" (whose existence is no longer felt in human ears because it is silent) leisurely circles over a city, and the people there unknowingly lose their movements and thoughts because their nerves have been permanently destroyed.</p>
<p>At the same time, across the Atlantic, exciting news from scientists was heard. It was news about using these ultra-high-frequency sound waves.</p>
<p>The British Ministry of Information reported that the British Launderers' Research Association, based on the research of twenty-six scientists and their assistants, was building a new method, namely "Laundry by Sound."</p>
<p>The adherence of dirt to fabric fibers (the essence of what makes up the clothes and supplies worn by everyone and fills every home) is due to tiny electrical charges. Soap bubbles and scrubbing cause it to neutralize and then carry it away. But there are many tiny specks of dirt that are often difficult to remove. Scientists therefore plan to build a mechanism to make soap exert its full effect and effectively shake off the entanglement of that dust. They are preparing to use this Ultrasonic Vibration Method.</p>
<p>Don't laugh at the scientists' humor, and don't worry about evil hands controlling silent things to carry out the work of destruction. Associating the above two reports, perhaps the device for defending against ultrasonic weapons is unexpectedly this laundry mechanism. And the original "killing weapon" is treated like a guest and used as the most effective tool to clean the dirt of the entire family and the entire city.</p>
<p>Never condemn science for creating behaviors in the murderous and cruel enterprise of war. Know that science is always humanity's most loyal and powerful friend! Happiness and sin are grasped in humanity's own hands and created by themselves!</p>
<p>What reason is there to doubt the progress of science instead of truly eradicating the demons that turn happiness into sin?</p>
<h3>Why Germany Didn't Have the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Until the Nazi surrender, the US military was uneasy and panicked about the question of "whether the Nazis could build an atomic bomb." In fact, this was an overestimation. In early September this year, the British magazine "Nature" published an article by German physicist Werner Heisenberg, in which the Nobel Prize winner formally explained why Germany could not build an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>He said that they were almost successful in completing the construction of the "pile" and never attempted to build an atomic bomb, only using the "pile" to generate atomic energy. Before the war, physicists around the world knew that an atom of "U-235," a light and extremely rare isotope of uranium, could be split to release a lot of energy. At the same time, they also knew that the neutrons after the atomic fission would continue to cause other atoms to split in a "Chain Reaction," so what the United States considered a "secret" was actually known to Germany. When the war broke out in 1939, Germany also knew that the United States was using huge sums of money to explore atomic energy (Dr. Heisenberg did not explain how he knew). So they immediately formulated a plan to start research. However, the doctor lamented in the article: "The Germans were too negligent in atomic physics from 1933 to 1939," and therefore they did not have tools, such as the most important "Cyclotron." They only had two well-equipped test facilities, and their research encountered great obstacles in the absence of tools.</p>
<p>At the beginning, they adopted the same method as their enemy (referring to the United States). In order to obtain atomic energy, they decided that they must first extract a light and rare isotope of uranium, "U-235," from uranium ore. The United States had already done this at Oak Ridge (generally known as the Atomic City), but in order to save some other industries that were destroyed by bombing, the German scientists did not immediately create another one.</p>
<p>In building a chain-reacting pile that could complete the "chain fission reaction," they also made a big mistake. This pile is to make a certain substance react with uranium, which would cause the atom to split and slow down the neutrons released from the split, so that they could continue to cause other atoms to split in a chain reaction. In theory, both the United States and Germany knew that carbon and heavy water were this "certain substance," but the United States used carbon (a soft, black natural carbon) as a "controller," while the German scientists were determined to use heavy water. So they concentrated on manufacturing slow and expensive heavy water, thus letting the Americans take the lead.</p>
<p>The United States used carbon to generate the highly explosive "Piutonium," and the Germans' idea of ​​this possibility was very vague. So he simply did not attempt to build an atomic bomb, and naturally did not need a cyclotron to produce "Piutonium." Their goal was to directly use atomic energy from the pile in general industry, and they had too little funding, only one-thousandth of what the United States spent (the United States spent 2 billion gold). Moreover, the senior military leaders in Germany have always believed that the war would end in 1942, and there was no need to spend such a large sum of money to build an atomic bomb that was not necessarily successful, which also brought great obstacles to the German scientists.</p>
<p>Despite so many difficulties and obstacles, they were almost successful. Their experimental model of using heavy water to control the pile of neutrons was much better than the American carbon pile. In Norway, they painstakingly built a heavy water factory, but it was bombed by US planes after only two tons of heavy water were produced. The constant air raids caused great damage to German industry. Transportation was cut off, and the builders of the pile could not get the uranium ore they needed, and they had to work entirely in air-raid shelters. Finally, they even fled to a rock cave near a small village 32 miles from Stuttgart. At this time, their initial pile had already started working. But soon, on April 22, the US military captured the small village, and everything was confiscated by the US military.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Navigation Position</h3>
<p>— Wan Gongyu</p>
<p>——A new method of measurement——</p>
<p>When an aircraft is flying, determining its position is a very important issue. Here we introduce a new measuring instrument and method.</p>
<p>To simply solve many flight position problems, the new Radio flight-position fixer provides the driver with a continuous, easy-to-follow image of the aircraft's position. This was invented by an Air Force officer and will be manufactured by the (Sperry Gyroscope) company for military use.</p>
<p>It is built as a way to improve airborne safety in adverse weather, as well as to save time lingering in preparation for landing over airfields. The radio positioner is suitable for point-to-point air navigation and can be used for low-flying landings when visibility is poor.</p>
<p>The principle of the radio positioner is nothing more than simple trigonometric relations. Two radio direction finders turn to two stations on the ground separately. From the center of each indicator, a light shines out through the transparent face of the instrument. Its angle corresponds to the direction of the aircraft from the station. The location of the flight position is the intersection of these two rays. Because this visible indicator point moves completely with the position of the aircraft, the trajectory of the movement of the intersection of the light rays is the road money of the aircraft's flight path projected on the ground. The direction of flight is indicated by the Elux gote in the middle point of the fast line of the two radio positioners. Because the centers of the two radio positioners are three inches apart on this instrument, the ratio scale of how many miles per inch is displayed on the instrument determines the distance between the two stations on the energy map.</p>
<p>The flight process to any selected destination can be drawn on the surface of the positioner with a crayon or fluorescent pen (at night), and then the intersection of the light rays is often kept on this drawn road money, which means that the aircraft is flying along the original route. In aircraft on regular flight routes, the area contained or a simple map of all the flight stations on the road money can be pre-made on another transparent surface for application. Obstacles, restricted areas, and other appropriate flight records can be indicated above.</p>
<p>The value of this device for blind approach and blind landing can be seen in the fact that any driver can follow the instructions to fly in a specified area or approach in any direction.</p>
<p>Including the wireless fixed position meter (the full weight) and other settings, the total weight of the positioner is 200 pounds. Most commercial aircraft carry at least one radio direction finder.</p>
<h3>Is Mutation a Chemical Change?</h3>
<p>— Hao Tianhe</p>
<p>Another category, such as arsenic (:As) may be able to replace the sulfur (:S) and (:N) in mustard gas, but compounds containing arsenic are very unstable under physiological conditions, and most of them are poisonous. As for compounds containing phosphorus (:P), which can spontaneously burn in the air, sulfur dioxide (:SO2) compounds can similarly be expected to show some activity. There is also a possibility to use nitrites and isonitrites, as well as the corresponding thiocyanates and isothiocyanates as combined parts. Therefore, allyl isothiocyanate is noteworthy because this compound can exhibit a weak but definite mutagenic effect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this kind of chemical structure is not necessary for mutagens. This is indicated by the fact that Hacorn and Nigri removed the ovaries of fruit flies and immersed them in a weak solution of Phenol, which also produced many mutations.</p>
<p>Allyl isothiocyanate exists in nature within Brassica plants. We do not know whether it has a mutagenic effect in this plant. It would be interesting to observe how much responsibility those natural mutagens should bear for spontaneous mutation. Miller and Mott-Smith have shown that Cosmic radiathion and natural radiation are quantitatively insufficient to account for the rate of spontaneous mutation we see. Timofeff-ressovsky, Zimmer, and Delbruk have all suggested that the irregular temperature generated in the cell nucleus can sometimes exceed the ability required to produce a mutation. Based on the results reported here, it is possible that some natural mutations are due to the effect of mutagens in the organism. The production of that mutagen may be the result of its own base action. Such an assumption can find support in known examples, that is, there is a kind of fixed base that can affect the rest of the bases and cause mutations, and even affect special bases. Therefore, it is extremely interesting to find natural mutagens, but it may be very difficult, because a natural mutagen may have a characteristic that it will not have a drastic effect on the organism itself, otherwise that organism cannot survive. There is also the fact that under certain physiological conditions, between the power of several effective substances and the sensitivity of one or several bases, in the course of evolution, a precise and rational balance will eventually be reached. This system contains mutagens, and the production of mutagens is regulated by the bases.</p>
<p>However, often when a base is separated from its normal factorial environment, a natural mutagen can produce</p>
<p>very different effects, or no effect at all. Therefore, the results obtained from a certain organism cannot necessarily be applied to other organisms. Sometimes it may even conflict with the results obtained by using drastic methods such as X-rays and mustard gas.</p>
<p>Although we still have to consider the possibility that the evolution of species adopts a mutation method to adapt to the needs of the environment, so that a balance can be reached between the production of mutagens and the sensitivity of the caps.</p>
<p>(Note) This kind of substance can cause the occurrence of elemental life (End)</p>
