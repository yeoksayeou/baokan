<h3>論黃金之前途</h3>
<p>— 周伯棣</p>
<p>世界各國爲什麽要爭奪黃金，甚至於社會主義的蘇聯，也是要保有黃金呢？一般的說，那因爲金是國際的通貨，金是國際之間的最後的支付工具，金爲使幣值穩定的一种方法。茲分述之：</p>
<p>金是國際的通貨。—依國際貨幣恊定對國際貨幣單位雖未另創新名，但已規定「會員國之貨幣平價，應依黃金爲公分母表示之，或依一九四四年七月一日通行之美元重量與成色表示之」（恊定第四條第一款第一項），此種作公分母之黃金，在凱恩斯計劃下，將因會員國利用其透支權利而產生。</p>
<p>金是國際之間的最後的支付工具。—現代國際之間的收付，雖由匯兌或清算，但其最後的支付工具仍爲黃金。所以國際貨幣基金規定，會員國（四十餘國）加入，其配額之一部應以黃金繳付，幷應在某種條件下，將其黃金售於基金，以換回其本國貨幣。會員國並可將本國貨幣售於基金，以換取黃金。基金本身亦可以各國之貨幣兌換爲黃金。會員國的買賣黃金，不得在平價規定的限度以外。如此，各國的貨幣在對外價値上與黃金相聯繫，紙幣與黃金大有「水色連波波連天」之槪。黃金在今後，還是國際之間最後的支付工具。</p>
<p>金爲使幣值穩定的一種方法。—在今後，黃金並非爲貨幣之　基礎，但不失爲使幣値穩定的一种方法。要使黃金成爲貨幣之眞基礎，必須實行金本位；這金本位或者是以自由鑄造爲骨幹的金幣本位，或者是以無限制買賣黃金爲骨幹的金塊本位，均無不可。但無論如何，除自由鑄造或無限制買賣外，黃金的自由輸出或輸入，還是必要的。但任何國家均願攫得他國之黃金，而於已國之黃金則多實行禁止輸出，在這樣的狀態下，缺金之國不能行金本位，多金之國又不願行金本位，國爲一旦實行，開放金禁，黃金便將漏海以去。不能恢復金本位，却仍可利用貨幣基金的制度，穩定貨幣之外價。外價穩定，自得爲穩定內價之一動力。</p>
<p>在現代，黃金與其爲發鈔之準備，毋寧爲外匯之基金，黃金之對外使命，將重於對內的使命了。</p>
<p>因此，講到黃金政策，最理想的，自然是黃金國有，用黃金以對外。但爲實行黃金國有，如行沒收，則侵害私權，有失民心；如行徵收，則增發鈔票，促進膨脹；如發行金公價以換回黃金，則應募與否旣　自由，亦不易立見功效。故黃金國有一時未易實行，且在暫時亦尙無實行之必要。因人民爲保存幣値而吸收黃金，因吸收黃金而金價之黑市抬高，此在個人購買者言，固屬損失，但藏富於民在整個國民經濟言，亦未必即爲損失。</p>
<p>美國是多金之國，如以其所有的黃金爲　備來發行鈔票，那必定造成通貨的膨脹瞭。所以美國的流入之黃金由政府收購，收購超出某一數額，才賣與聯邦　備銀行，至收購下來的黃金，或配藏，或出賣于海外，此項出賣的價格是每盎斯三十五美元。這是法價。</p>
<p>美國因爲要使黃金不與鈔票發生不良的作用，故實行閹金政策（Gold　Sterilization　Policy），而其出賣黃金于國外，實爲閹金政策之一端，故其出賣價格也特別低。但在美國的自由金市（free　gold），那便每盎斯，値四十二·七五美元。這簡直比我國的黃金比價（四十美元）還要高出二·七五美元。好在我國的黃金大部分是用法價（三十五美元）批發過來的，我國的比價雖比美國的市價低，也並不會虧本。</p>
<p>在美國黃金的自由價格已是四十二美元以上，至在缺金之地，其自由價格也自然更高了。例如我國的比價爲四十美元，而澳門的自由價格便會合五十一美元，縱令此價過高，而四十五美元却應是很公道的價格，則仍比三十五美元高出十美元。一般言之，世界各國的金價均較高於美國，根據不完全的數字，孟買曾達七十餘美元，開羅一百另八美元，雅典一百十美元。至智利巴西密　美國；則亦爲四十餘美元。金價愈高，一方面表示金之缺乏，一方面表示金之需要愈烈。爲什麽如此需金？還不是爲了黃金有上文所述之功能？</p>
<p>我國人民近年以來亦特好購金，此或由於通貨膨脹，欲慾籍黃金爲價値之貯藏。但按之實際，通貨膨脹非爲人民購金之有力的原因；因爲如瑞士這些國家未有膨脹，而人民亦喜購金。瑞士的金價甚高，且欲輸出國外，必須得有護照。雖則如此，而黃金外流仍是滔滔不絕，故自本年九月初，瑞士的國家銀行即已停售黃金了。</p>
<p>由上所述，可知黃金在今後之世界，尙有其特殊之功用，世界各國，除美國因採用閹金政策的觀點，肯放出一部分黃金外，其餘的國家盡是要羅致黃金，或消極的防止黃金的損失的。因爲美國肯放出一部分黃金，所以金價有其平價點；因爲各國要羅致黃金，所以金價更有其參差不齊之高峯。</p>
<p>我國目前的黃金，雖不能實行國有，却已禁止自由賣買。禁止自由賣買，意即凍結黃金，使持有黃金的不能換成貨幣而流通於市面，這對於通貨收縮是不無帮助的。不過黃金之爲物，値大積小，藏之襟袖而人莫覺，私相交易而人難察，所以檢査雖嚴，而黑市價難禁絕。黑市的存在幾乎是無法避免的，但這比之公開市價之波瀾起伏，聲勢洶湧，對於物價的刺激總要微弱得多。黃金的黑市價格，對於物價，只是追隨的作用，不會起領導的作用，這是禁止黃金自由賣買的最大的好處。</p>
<p>反之，如爲消滅黑市，而索與開放黃金，那麽物價的波動必又多了一個刺激，投機市場又多了一個興風作浪的機會，而市場上的籌碼增多，通貨膨脹的火熖將更浇上了易燃的油料。所以筆者以爲黃金在目前，還是不該開放。</p>
<p>不過買黃金的本來有兩種人，一種是平民階級，他們積存了一點小額資金，按期買點金飾以代儲蓄；另一種是投機分子或富裕階級，大量買賣黃金以謀利潤。我們對於後一種人的黃金，不妨予以凍結，禁止賣買，而對於前一種人的黃金，從社會政策的立場看，却不宜完全予以禁絕。（參看拙著黃金政策之過去與今後）</p>
<p>次之，因銀樓停止賣買黃金，造成不少人的失業，金飾賣買的開放，也不失爲一個救濟。</p>
<p>不過銀樓之賣買飾金，須有相當的管制。此項管制不可失之過嚴（過嚴則供求失衡），也不可失之過寬（過寬則多流弊）。這裏包括一個進貨價格的問題。現在我們假定銀樓收進價格是法價四十美元，於是願　將飾金兌換給銀樓，那麽銀樓的黃金也就有一個來路了。無如黃金在國內，除四十美元的法價之外，還可能有一個黑市（例如澳門的五十一美元），如黑市高於法價，那麽人們便不願把黃金售予銀樓，於是在銀樓方面，賣買不能平衡。此時在銀樓方面必希望抬高賣價，以便以其餘利求進貨於黑市，庶幾亦得平衡其買賣。在此種情形下，銀樓仍有利潤，而最吃虧的却是貧苦階級的出賣者，他們因爲生活的必要，不能不以　價出讓其僅有之黃金。</p>
<p>所以銀樓之進貨價格，是否絕對以法價爲標準，實値得討論。筆者以爲隻要控制了收買的量，其收買的價不必一定以法價爲準的。就用黑市價格，亦還是無妨的。如此，則銀樓的賣價與買價不致相距過遠，而賣買却易得平衡。</p>
<p>上列這個辦法，無異開放了黃金的小額賣買。這不會發生流弊嗎？筆者以爲這是無妨的。這好比是在坡度很大的河流上，築一個堰，使洪流不致冲下，以保護萬頃的良田，那便是黃金禁止賣買。但在那個堰裏仍不妨開一個小閘，使之有細水長流，侵潤田禾，那便是銀樓的賣買黃金。物價決不會因金飾上漲而被刺激上漲的。因爲金飾在物價指數的構成中，不占重要的地位。金價這所以影響物價，那因其大量買賣，通過金融的關係，這才得影響物價，刺激物價。所以單純的金價（不通過金融），便不是物價的連手。這一點似也値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>日前銀樓的買賣金飾又將開放，但因買賣價格關係尙未定局。又似乎一時難於順利復榮。據九月十七日的報載，買價爲四十美元，賣價可能爲六十八美元，買賣價格似乎相去過遠。這不消説，因爲收買價格根據於法價，故不能不把出賣價格提得更高吧。然而這如上文所述，恐於貧苦階級有損，而於黑市交易倒反容易有助長之勢的。</p>
<p>筆者的結論，黃金的自由交易目前仍得繼續禁止，但飾金的小額賣買則不防開放，而開放的時候，須嚴格控制其數量，形態（製成飾物）和品質，却不必要硬性規定其收買價格。（十月一日）</p>

<h3>工程師年會開幕禮中　曾養甫至開會詞原文</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中國工程師學會第十四屆年會，二日晨在京開幕，該會會長曾養甫致簡短開會詞，原詞略謂：</p>
<p>本屆年會，是我們中國工程師在抗日戰事結束後初次在首都舉行的年會，意義特別重大，我想參加年會的各位工程師，一定是感想萬千。</p>
<p>國父說：「非常破壞之後，必　之以非常建設。」中國經過八年抗戰，國家與人民公私建設事業破壞至鉅。抗戰結束前，政府曾公佈了第一期經濟建設原則，又擬訂了物質建設五年計劃，蔣主席在他所著「中國之命運」中，更提示了十年建設的綱目和數字；大家都渴望戰後建設能夠順利開始和進行，但是抗戰結束剛滿兩年，不可　　的，建設的呼　是消沉下去了，這是什麽原因呢？</p>
<p>這是因爲戰　建設的口號有兩個弱點。</p>
<p>戰　建設兩個弱點</p>
<p>第一：把建設計劃　　在對共產黨和平商談的上面，「和平」「建設」成了不可分的名詞。在我們工程師的眼光看來，有了和平就好建設，這句話是正確的，沒有和平就不能建設，這句話却是絕對錯誤的。共黨是一個不妥恊的黨，想與他和平相處，乃是不可能的事，所以等待着對共黨和平商談成功，再來建設，當然更不可能。如果建設事業能夠進行，人民就有就業樂業的機會，那些受共黨挾持的民衆，就會回到工厰，回到耕地，決不會再供叛亂者驅使。</p>
<p>第二：把建設計劃　　在國際援助上面。一個國家，必須自力更生，才能與國外合作，但我們在一百年來不平等條約束縛之下，已養成民族自卑感和倚賴心，徘徊瞻顧，致阻礙瞭我們爲國家民族樹立獨立自主的物質基礎的信心，兩年來歲月遷流，而我們公共工程的建設，以及民族工業的發展，並無重大成就，其癥結未嘗不是在此。</p>
<p>公共工程復興動力</p>
<p>我們今日要硏究的問題，是一個私有財產和自由企業的社會裏，怎樣去實施建設計劃？解答了這個問題，我們就可以明瞭公共工程在建設計劃中的地位和職責。所謂公共工程，其領域包括鐵路，公路，水利，港灣，碼頭等公共建築，也就是指動員大量人力，有裨於公共利益的工程。</p>
<p>在長期抗戰以後，生產萎縮與社會購買力的低落，是一個必然的現象；國家爲促成戰後經濟的複興，最當注意的事有三：第一是致力於國家公共工程，第二是增加農工礦種生產量及增加人民的勞務，第三是增進輸出貿易，以上三者，有互相配合的關係，而尤以公共工程爲全部的樞紐。國家投資於公共工程，使破壞的區域重建，使完好的區域繁榮，使人民的就業機會增加；人民收入增加，社會購買力充裕，農工礦生產量必見增加，而輸出貿易可增進。所以戰後經濟的復興，其動力完全繫於公共工程的建設。</p>
<p>在實業發達的國家，社會經濟的繁榮和衰落，是有週期性的。社會經濟的繁榮，常引起生產過剩的現象，而以經濟衰弱爲結局。國家對於這週期性恐慌，可用公共工程　　，國家如投資於公共工程，則可減少社會經濟　條的嚴重性，因此公共工程又成爲社會經濟發展中一個重要的平衡力量．英美的經濟學者，近年來已經開始重視國家的公共工程，中國是一個實業落後的國家，所以我們更應該致全力於公共工程的建設，以爲戰後經濟復興的動力．國父的實業計劃，是第一次世界大戰後訂定的，但他重視公共工程，與第二次大戰後英美進步的經濟學者毫無二致，我們深以有此先知先覺的遺訓自豪，我們應該硏究怎樣才可以踐履實施，用以恢復戰後國家的實力。今天謹以此自任，並以此自勉。</p>
<h3>胡適致中央社函全文</h3>
<p>（上接一版）胡氏原函如下：我在九月五日在上海對新聞記者談話，九月七日在北平對新聞記者談話，都談到爭取學術獨立的十年計劃，都提及各大學本年分到外匯太少的問題，因舉本年留學經費所用外匯數量之大，作一個對照，後來因爲有幾個朋友打出，政府外匯的花費，何止留學一項，所以在九月中旬，有幾個新聞記者來問我，我當時曾把在南方聽得朋友說的幾件關於外匯的消息，舉出幾項，其中一項，是說馮玉祥先生和他同行諸位，在一年半之中，共領美金六十萬元，另一項是說資源委員會派到美國考察的專門技術人員，有四百人之多。後來我收到水利部部長薛篤弼先生來信，說「馮先生奉派赴美考察水利，奉准隨帶秘書三人，及水利專家二人，一行共六人，先後共奉行政院核發考察費三次，計　卅五年六月發國幣卅六萬元，美金五萬另二百元，　卅六年七月發美金二萬三千八百元，以上共計國幣卅六萬元，　美金十三萬四千元，均係由財政部直接撥給，並奉行政院分令本部知照，有案可稽」。我又收到資源委員會委員長翁文灝先生來信，說「資委會在戰時戰後，先後派赴美國實習人員，總數確有四百人左右，其中主要係租借法案實習人員，奉政府通令辦理者，五月間北重長本會後，　於國家外匯艱窘，即嚴令各案實習人員提前返國，現已返國者二百五十餘人，另有六十餘人正候輪返國，目前仍留美者，計不及百人，實習期滿後亦即返國」。我現在正式請中央社替我發表這封信，更正我上月的錯誤，我借這個機會正式向馮玉祥先生和資委會道歉，至於馮玉祥先生公開信內關於他買屋買田的話，我完全不曾談過，當然我不用答覆他。胡適卅六年十月四日。</p>

<h3>安理會令飭三國委員會　立即解決印荷爭端　吧城領事團報吿稱停戰令未能生效　葛羅米柯斥荷蘭為侵略國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三日電〕聯合國安理會今夜以九票對零票通過澳外長伊伐特提案，飭令比澳美三國委員會立即設法解決荷蘭與印尼衝突。蘇聯與波蘭棄權。先是，安理會曾接調査團報吿書，謂東印度境內仍有嚴重戰事，並有搶刧及殺害人民等事，其中以爪哇及蘇門答臘華僑受吿尤烈。蘇聯提議荷蘭與印尼軍隊同時撤回原防案，延期至星期二下次會議討論。領事調査團報吿書曾謂在目下情勢中，停戰令殊難完全執行，兩國繼續衝突之原因在於未能劃定界綫。報吿書並稱，荷軍於七月二十日至八月四日之間曾侵入印尼領土數處，在此侵入地區之間仍有印尼正規軍及游擊隊。安理會發出停戰令後，荷印政府曾宣佈擬在其所指定之防錢內完全恢復治安，解除所有武裝組織之槍械，而其所指定之防綫，曾將其侵入印尼領土之前進陣地相連接，因將其間印尼正規軍及游擊隊包括在內。此邦防錢非印尼所能承認，因之哨兵衝突游擊隊狙擊之事時有發生。此爲停戰令不能發生效力之癥結所在。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖三日電〕今日安理會討論印荷爭端問題時，蘇代表葛羅米柯以俄語發表冗長之演說，渠攻擊「某數國政府」希望將領團報吿嚴守秘密。「荷蘭政府言行相符，蓋荷蘭曾稱如安理會之建議不遂其意，將置之不顧也。」渠謂某數國政府支持荷蘭，如無此支持，荷蘭不敢率爾作此言論，亦不敢蔑棄安理會之決議。葛氏又指荷政府乃侵略者，並重提蘇聯之要求，應令雙方撤退至戰爭開始前之地位。葛氏稱印尼人民飽受虐待，彼等正在抵抗一侵略國家，故彼等採取焦土戰術，無可非議。荷駐美大使克里芬斯纔之發言，對葛氏稱荷蘭爲侵略者，表示遣憾，渠稱在印尼停止暴行及製造有利之解決「良好空氣」前，三國委員會將無能爲力。</p>

<h3>聯大託管委會展開激辯　英維護殖民制度　我國代表保持公正產場</h3>

<p>渠稱，將非自治領土中之政治活動情形，報吿聯合國之舉，不啻爲組織一國際性政治大會，從而干與管理國及其殖民地人民有關之事件。蘇聯代表立即抨擊英國此項意見，而稱英國爲維護殖民制度者。我代表鄭震宇則認爲憲章中雖未明令管理國家提出關於其所轉非自治領之政治情報，但按照懲章條款之精神，實應將此項報吿送交大會。</p>

<h3>辯論希臘問題　波代表發言</h3>

<p>此五千萬元以及法國可望自布魯塞爾三國委員會獲得之德國所刧黃金價値九千三百萬元，可使法國渡過國會通過對法義奧三國八億元臨時援助計劃以前之危急時期。在今日之閣議中，總統及其閣僚曾研究總統經濟顧問委員會最近提出之報吿。</p>
<p>〔合衆社伊里諾州溫田城四日電〕參議院民主黨領袖魯加斯四日吿報界稱：美國必須準備在四年中以一百億元作爲西半球防務費用，除非國會在十二月一日前批准西歐緊急援助。渠稱：「歐洲現極易爲共產主義滲人，若共產黨能在西半球獲得立脚點，吾人將受到眞正之危險。」渠警吿稱：若國會委員會聽取歐洲救濟計劃，在十二月一日前無結果，然後再召集國會，考慮救濟計劃，將無濟於事。</p>
<h3>美農長呼籲　國民節糧援歐　勒克曼起草具體計劃</h3>

<h3>對遴派參議員事　潘議長發表談話　民靑兩黨人士當選自所歡迎　惟應依法從事正當競選活動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於民靑兩黨要求根據施政方針修改現行各省市縣參議會之法規，俾民靑兩黨人士，得以遴選方式，達到參加民意機構一事，巿參議會前曾就法理及事實各方面列舉理由，電呈中央請重行考慮此一建議，藉免政府蒙立法毁法重黨輕民之嫌。中國背年黨發言人王師曾氏復於本月二日發表談話加以辯論。記者特以此事徵詢市參議會之意見。據潘議長稱：民主政治之目要條件即爲守法精神。各省市縣之正式參議會爲民意機關，祇能講法律，不能講戰派，更不能講人情。民靑兩黨　有不少人才，且頗多平素友好，設能依法當選爲參議員，吾人自所歡迎。但須知無論何黨何派人士，如欲爲民選之參議員，均應在法律範圍以內從事其正當之競選活動，不能假手於政府之遴派也。民主政治之促進，全國國民人人皆有其責任，更無必需身爲民意機關代表之後，始能高談民主。至於國民參政員之產生，依國民參政會組織條例之規定，原有遴選與選舉兩種，且參政會之性質，原為集思廣益，與省市縣參議會條例所規定者，未可同日而語。民靑兩黨果欲參加地方民意機關，爲遴選之參議員，至多亦祇能在臨時參議會中試辦，絕不能涉及正式參議會。至民靑兩黨以參加監委競選為理由，此點早經本會申述，監委候選人並無黨籍之限制，更無必以參議員爲候選人之規定也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊」總工會理事長水祥雲，偕同該會理事梁水章，仇長江，章子衡，周福江等，於昨晨往訪社會局長吳開先，表示本月份工人生活指數較上月份上漲百分之十，而職員指數上漲百分之十五，其原因係因工人有實物配給，但事實上多數工廠爲選免麻煩並未申請配售，工人並未領得實物，而指數則不問配不配皆依配價編製，因之廠方雖省却手續，而工人則吃虧太甚。且職業工人無配給，社會局對此有無補救辦法。吳局長當表示配米各廠多已領去，配油與配煤球，民食調配會曾三令五申並刊登廣吿囑各廠申請繳款前往領取，煤球準備二十五萬七千擔，但至今祇領去十五萬擔，其餘尙無人申請。各工廠自動放棄申請，並不犯罪，社會局自不能强迫，但受損者爲工人，故希望總工會能通知各工會協同社會局加以營促，要求廠方負責申請配售。現第一期配售煤球等雖已截止申請，但仍可通融申請補配。</p>

<h3>五平劇院　昨無夜戲　班底爭待遇一怒罷演·　·今日可復常靜候調處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市天蟾·中國·黃金·大舞　·共舞　五平劇院，昨晚因班底要求改善待遇突然罷工，夜戲被逼停派。天蟾一度因觀衆騷擾，損失甚巨。社會局常晚派員調解，勞資雙方均同意今日先行復工，再靜候調停。故今日各歲院日戎場仍照常演出。</p>
<p>五平劇院班底約六百餘人，以前均有固定薪給，平均每人每月在六十八萬元至七十萬元間。近月來要求改用生活指數，迭次商談，資方在原則上已予同意，惟底薪數目，勞方最初堅持六十元，嗣後一再自動减至四十五元，而資方則僅允卅五元，迄未妥協。社局對此事曾召集雙方詢問，並定明日再談判。昨日下午四時勞資各派代表在天蟾再度自行磋商，資方出席者，有中國汪其俊，天蟾唐平凡，大舞臺范恒裕，共舞臺張善珊，黃金周禧如，勞方有邱玉成，吳四寳，郭慶鵬等，據勞方代表稱：談判時資方注其俊堅持底薪不能超過卅五元，天蟾方面則頗有意加至四十元，終因中國等四家堅持卅五元，且言語中發生誤會。勞方代表邱玉成等將談判經過報告大衆後，羣情憤慨，一怒罷演。</p>
<h3>不見梅博士·　·茶杯上台來</h3>
<p>昨日適爲週末，亦爲梅蘭芳在天蟾演出之第三塲打泡戲紅鬃烈馬，下午三時即有觀衆列隊往天蟾等看梅博土。三樓二棋未至五時已各滿。候至七時半未聞開羅，三樓觀衆首先呌囂，繼將茶杯擲向戲台，並將長櫈自三樓摔下。幸前排觀衆尙未入座，僅有台上脚燈，電扇·椅座等略受損壞，並未傷人。中國·黃金·大舞台·共舞台各處，院方得悉現底罷工後，即張貼佈吿，並請警局派員警到院維持秩序，協助辦理退票，均未發生事故。</p>
<h3>損失兩萬萬·　·保留賠償權</h3>
<p>據天蟾經理周劍星稱：昨晚梅蘭芳最後一天打泡戲，全部票子早經銷售一空，單一塲票價損失已達一億零五百萬元，其餘如前台職員·後台工人薪水·房金·水電·大角兒包銀·戲票戲單等損失已不可計算。同時中國損失亦達四千萬元，黃金三千萬，共舞台·大舞台亦各有三千萵元。此種損失資方昨向社會局派往調解之朱承浩·葛夢松二人表示，保留要求賠償權。</p>
<h3>停演非勞方本意</h3>
<p>據勞方所組織之伶界聯合會負責人向記者表示：此事係資方毫無誠意，自動停演，以致造成此一僵局，決非勞方本意如此。該會更指出資方與資方之間，本身亦有矛盾，蓋各戲院之營業狀况，亦大有好壞之分也。</p>

<h3>四十四萬萬與六十八萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕平劇院所謂班底，包括「跑龍套」，「檢塲」，「場面」，「衣箱」，及「武行」等人員，除每月可擭得工資六十八萬元外，其餘一無所得，且爲食宿自理。反顧「京朝大角」之包銀，據熟悉內幕者談：梅蘭芳劇團此次在天蟾公演，其四十天中之包銀分配，爲梅蘭芳四億元，楊寳森一億二千萬，蕭長華八千萬，李多奎七千萬，錢寳森四千萬。戲院方面如賣滿堂，每日可得一億四千萬，包括茶資五千元及戲單二千元。故以此計算，四十天之總和，即再打一八折而論，亦可達四十四億八千萬元。勞方認爲以六十八萬元與之相較，實有天壤之別云。</p>

<p>自昨日本市各報刊出法商電車電力公司招募新工人之廣告後，昨晨七時許　家　公司門前人山人海，申請登記願就業者遂三千多人，法商工人知已不能再堅持罷工，乃自動請整理委員會將雲龍·楊金根·葉紀舟·蔡全發等晋謁吳開先局長，要求給予最後調停機會。吳局長允將限期延長至下午五時。將雲龍等辭出後即分頭向工人勸導復工，下午三時許即有機務部工人七百餘人先行到廠復工，車務部外動職工二百餘亦接踵來廠報到。社會局駐廠人員曁工會整理委員會，囑令車務部司機、賣票，先回家更換號衣，再行來廠服務。同時派出紅色公共汽車及定備電車各一輛，駛往滬西·滬南，接車務部工人來廠。四時十五分左右，工人已一律衣黃色號衣絡續到廠，由公司當局發給票箱，鑰匙，分發工作。第一輛廿二路公共汽車（照會一四九八八號）出廠恢復行駛時，爲下午四時廿五分。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨日上午親往法商電車公司新工人登記處巡視，並至公司處理一般問題。上午有甚多工人向公司聲明對政府及公司決無反感，數日來不能復工係由於遭受威脅。請公司通知政府保障復工工人安全，即可於下午復工。吳局長當表示如工人於下午四時前至公司復工者，絕對保障其安全。</p>
<h3>今日·　·續辦登記·</h3>
<p>據吳局長稱：法商電車工人至昨日下午四時止，登記復工工人者佔全部十分之七。工人於過四時限止復工時間後，仍有要求復工者，現已決定今日（五日）仍可辦理登記，但需經社會局會同公司審核，如査明確係善良工人而係受威脅罷工，經雙方同意仍可准予復工。但如平時品行不良或有煽動罷工行爲者，暫不准復工。</p>

<p>〔本報漣水一日訊〕勝利後和湯恩伯將軍第一批飛到京滬受降的前第三方面軍副司令官張雪中將軍，現在是淮海綏靖區司令官。抗戰初期的南口，台兒莊之役，和抗戰末期反攻柳州，桂林之役，張將軍所給與人們鮮明的印象，到目前還深深地恪印在每一個人的腦海中。今年三月間，他繼堅守臨城之後到蘇北來，担任這付艱重的担子。</p>
<p>張司令官</p>
<p>接見記者時，就提出了他所堅持　的兩個方針：第一是各階層普遍而密切地聯繫起來，通力合作，打成一片，來防匪，剿匪。第二是在部隊本身，積極地爭取機動作戰，以粉碎奸匪流　的故技。</p>
<p>運河錢的治安，差不多大部份都由自衛隊負責，駐防部隊則隨時相機出發淸剿。運河綫上兩淮北至徐州南至江都，現在都非常安定，交通也很安全。在</p>
<p>組織民衆　　方面，現在淮海綏靖區已開始辦理，誠如張司令官在淮陰民運幹部訓練班開學典禮中所說：「防匪，剿匪，現在已和防火，防賊同爲我們日常生活起居中所必需做到的事情。」</p>
<p>不久以前，徐碼頭之役，國軍以不足一團之衆，將匪軍在蘇北號稱最精說之部淮海軍分區警衛團全部約千餘人全部殲滅。並　斃團長一人，政委一人，營長二人，專員一人，（偽第六區專員吳覺），縣長二人（偽淮陰縣長陳乃同，漣水縣長陳亞昌）。偽邊區政府主席李一氓，僥倖地泅水逃出。這一役，在蘇北綏靖諸役中，要算是一個硬仗。記者來到收復已經快近一年的漣水。瓦磚逼地。</p>
<p>漣水二景　（上）城西之妙通塔（下）蒼凉的街頭（松壽攝）</p>
<p>四郊多壘</p>
<p>連水還是在緊張和凄寂的氣氛籠單之下。</p>
<p>就整個漣水縣來說，漣水城偏於西南角，東北距海邊達二百餘里。事實上，漣水城實在太荒凉了，市面抵不上江南一個小鎭市，人口祇六千餘人，還包括鄉區流亡二千在內。京滬報紙要五天以後才能看到，各報總銷數計共四十二份，以本報最多，才不過銷了十份。這裏還得補充一句：四十二份報紙中，訂戶衹有兩家是商店，其餘都是機關中看的。</p>
<p>一般說來，物價是便宜的，魚祇賣三千元一斤，可是吃得起的人還是少數。</p>
<p>漣水的地形太好，易守難攻。現在漣水的城防是不用　　的。</p>
<p>淮海綏靖區司令官張雪中將軍（本報特派記者凌松壽攝）</p>
<p>漣淮公路</p>
<p>旣平坦又安定，因為這條公路被古黃河和運　河緊緊地夾住，成爲大然的兩道防綫。所以兩條河對面散匪，雖常在流　，可是畢兌不敢過河。</p>
<p>漣水城西古塔，相傳附近即爲能仁寺，此塔名妙通塔。一年前，整七十四師攻</p>
<p>漣水一役</p>
<p>在此塔畔所付的代價極大，因爲塔很高，匪軍在上面架了兩挺重機槍，火力猛熾，甚難突破。而此塔因受我軍重大砲力之射擊。也窟　處處，　體　傷了。記者和高　玉參謀等，作鳥步行而升塔頂，四望無際，塔之南北，波　洶湧，塔之附近，稼禾遍地，而秋風正勁，大雨欲來，積　似　，我注視著塔後的七十四師陣亡將士的公墓，裏面藏着爲國爲民而捐軀的烈士七百餘人，不由得嗅出了蒼京悲壯的氣息。（特派記者凌松　）</p>
<h3>綏省參議會議長　對彭學沛談邊情　亟盼中樞注視北部國防綫</h3>
<p>〔本報歸緩四日電〕彭學沛，孫越崎一行，三日抵綏後，董主席，張　長欽，榮宣慰使祥笻多人，均到站歡迎。彭等下軍後，即在傅主任官邸與各首長會談，緩雀參議會議長張欽向彭陳述三事：</p>
<p>綏省人民在抗戰及剿匪期間忍死爲國，負擔奇重，迄今得到振濟不足二十億元，但人民僅以十萬重鞋一項負擔，已在三十億元以上。</p>
<p>伊盟災情</p>
<p>已非慘重字樣所可形容，數十萬人民今冬恐將悉數因凍餒而死，盼中央切實救濟。蒙旗自治問題，綏遠人民了解最爲深切，緩省蒙漢人民親密相處，垂三百年，經日寇之挑撥而有德王百靈廟之自治，現綏遠絕大多數漢民，竭誠贊助</p>
<p>蒙旗自治</p>
<p>惟以旗為自治單位，受省統轄，否則盟等於省特別旗亦受中央直轄，則同一省境之內四分五裂，其後患不堪設想。綏遠爲國防最前錢，以一省力量談不到建設國防，亟盼中央注視此北部國防綫，綏遠人民今日僅差堪自衛，因人民組訓年來在傳主任，董主席主特下，頗有成績，日前爲維持</p>
<p>綏境治安</p>
<p>各地自衛力量不可忽視，但人民自衛槍枝極感缺乏，盼中央撥給槍枝，或由人民　　亦可。彭對張氏所陳各項甚爲嘉納，允向中樞當局轉達。</p>
<h3>靑島中紡第六廠　修鍋工程將完竣</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島四日電〕中紡公司靑島分公司修理鍋爐引起爭執，詳情已誌前報，茲據該分公司負賣人吿記者：該分公司所屬六紡織廠原有卅噸C·T·M·鍋爐一座，在日人管理時，係用瓦斯以代燃料，某次因爐管爆裂，瓦斯不能及時關閉，致燒「乾鍋」，所有爐管因受過熱而呈彎曲，其損壞情况極形嚴重。接收後始由該廠着手修理，當時僅將爐管更換一部份，勉强應用，隨時有影醫生產之處。該廠機動課工程師認爲僅將水管上方之爐管割下十餘條而換以新管，此項修理方法係屬臨時救濟性質，爲求一勞永逸計，不得不澈底大修，將全部爐管悉數更換。動工以後，兩月之內尙稱順利，不料八月間該廠工人與工程師發生意見，牽及該爐修理方法，該分公司當局爲和緩起見，乃調原有技師陳萊盛（陳技師曾調任靑島電廠參加修理透平工作）回廠，居間工作，其辦法則仍照原來大修計劃進行。茲悉：雙十節前後，此項大修工程，即可順利完成矣。</p>
<h3>川禁烟督理處　請派重兵剷毒</h3>
<p>〔本報成都二日訊〕川省烟毒迄未禁絕，尤以川東區爲特甚。川禁烟督理處已呈請渝行轅指派入員統率重兵巡迴査剷。又全川各縣市已開始普遍舉行烟民總登記，據確切調査，全省現有烟民總數約在一百廿萬人左右。記者另據禁烟負責人談：川烟毒禁絕困難原因，　夷務問題未澈底解決，邊區情形複雜。　執行人員貪汚包庇，犯烟者多爲地方有勢力份子，推進困難，如最近屏山縣長爲禁烟剷種得罪巨室而去職，即其一例。　財政困窘，禁烟經費支絀，計劃類多紙上談兵，現中央已決定明年上年度爲總檢査時期，並需由各級執行人員分別出具切結，但川省禁政之能否如限完成，須視執行人員努力至如何程度而定。（記者周學端）</p>
<h3>野猪成羣　月夜吃稻　被害農田約兩百畝</h3>
<p>〔本报　源二日訊〕本邑南北兩鄉，最近發現野猪數百頭，分羣踐食禾稼，為害之厲，不亞蝗災。尤以邑北自考水，瑤村段，至佛兒嶺，高倉，新源一帶爲最甚。被害之田約在二百餘畝，損失不下五千萬元。連村農戶，雖出課合力抵禦，惟因猪藏之處，山區廣　，多屬森林，其來也，每在星月皎潔之際，每　集猪數十頭，由大者在前帶領，餘跟後進，人驅之不散，以銃擊之，又恐逢怒獠八，欲加防止，成嘆窮於應付。</p>
<p>據一胡姓老農語記者：野猪之勁敵是豺犬，豺性喜食猪，食法是集多數之豺，　見野猪，豺即以便溲，遍洒樹業柴葉上，猪月觸溲立盲，羣豺　逐猪於平壙之處，以前足伸入猪之大便口而入腹，挖出肝腸，挂諸樹根，猪痛狂奔，　時腸血出盡而斃，羣豺聚而食之，故野猪知豺來，莫不急趨遠進。古來野猪害禾，年歲定凶，米價定昂，猪食禾後，豺必追至，爲民除害。前證可憑，歷歷不爽。農言如是，姑併記之。（特約記者兪寗頗）</p>

<h3>淸秋話東大　本報記者趙展</h3>
<p>看到北陵蒼蒼　　的吉柏，漢卿樓頂悠然閒散的白雲，我想，東北大學像一個畸零的少年，默默地沉思在無邊的秋色裏。</p>
<p>記者參觀了車大之後，代理校長劉樹勛光生吿訴我：其他學校所有的困難，東大都有，東大的問題，也是全國各大學的問題，不過，其他學校沒有的困難，東大是獨　了。</p>
<p>他舉一個例子，冬煤的問題在　　就沒有如此嚴重，冬季煤款需要流通劵五億；這是下一筆鉅大的數目，據他說朱部長來瀋的時侯，答應想辦法，款子至今還沒有發下來，看東大那些疏疏落落的建築物，沒有煤，就不能和冬天同住。</p>
<p>朱部長在東北視察的結論：說東大復員情形最糟，東大的學生和敎職員聽了這話很不高興，他們滿腹牢騷，說最糟的是接收專員王某，並不是全體，王某負責學校校舍的修建工作，串通建築商舞弊，撈了一注津財，逍遙北平去了。臧啓方先生當然應該負責。這件事直接引起了今年春天的學潮，恐怖份子乘機活動，一顆手溜彈丢在漢卿樓的水泥地板上，十幾個學生被投入黑獄，我去看爆炸的地點，彈痕正像一個學生不慎摔掉了墨水瓶，但已褪了顏色，這原來的建築可說是堅固極了。修建還不劃一年，房頂漏了，門和地板也壞了，實在可惜，「修建」的是什麽？</p>
<p>從表面上看，東大像一座荒蕪了的花園，蔓草茸長，荆　積生，朱部長的印象可能受雜亂無章的外景影響，况且因爲太多的困難包圍了學生，學生便又包　住了朱部長，雖然朱部長的慷慨諾言替自己解了　，然而學生仍然爲困難所包圍着。朱部長走了，留給學生的是希望的誘惑。</p>
<p>東大五院，學生兩千八百餘名，秋季新生五百餘名，暑期畢業二百餘名。五院之中，法商學院獨秀一枝，學生將近千各。工學院學生最少，僅二百餘人，據校中人談，因僞滿校理工課程淺近，只注重授以技術訓練，故高中學生進入大學，工學院課程趨不上去，均視爲畏途。本屆畢業學生，大部已就業，以工學院學生出路較好，東北處處需材，關內大學生畢業後就業的比率，不過百分之五十呢！</p>
<p>學生有困難，敎授也有困難，一串的難題和誤解打結。東北是戰區，物價高過京滬平津，而國立大學的待遇則是一律的，那麽敎授誰願意到東北來？因爲講敎授的問題，引起學生對劉代校長的誤解，在朱部長之前，他們說東大不是工學院，他們要求第一流的敎育家主持東大。劉代校長原是工學院院長，他請工學院的敎授自然比請農學院的敎授容易些。</p>
<p>敎授苦於學生程度不齊，難以覓取一致的水準。一般學生英文水準，和國文程度都低，英文不得不分甲乙兩組敎授，乙組敎高中課程，其他課程也盡量採中文譯本。</p>
<p>學生吃兩種膳食，由內地復員來的公費學生吃稻米，四菜一湯，東北入學的學生，很多是匪區逃來的學生，沒有任何接濟，公費生願和自費生平均吃苦，吃高梁米，一分靑菜，如此差別，無形中造成上種心理的界限。</p>
<p>安東二千男女靑年流亡學生，寄住在東大的一角落，他們沒有學校，也沒有書本兩個月來，他們在草地上遊蕩，或是在地板上瞌睡，不耐煩的吹口哨或沉思。夏天他們穿一身單衣逃難，眼見冬天就來了，哀訴無處，眼淚是不能禦寒的。記者問一個小姑娘想家嗎？她紅着眼圈跑開了。東大的學生比起這些流亡的孩子們，還算幸運兒。</p>
<p>看到東大在困難中挣扎，我們默祝它的新生。東大由一個激動的春天到爽朗的秋天，有很大的進步，現在可以說是步入正規了。</p>

<h3>女排球聯賽結束　女隊榮膺冠軍　友聯力戰三局受挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆排球聯賽女子組昨晚圓滿結束，友隊五戰五勝榮膺冠軍，昨最後一塲，以二比一力戰擊敗友聯完成大業。友隊因劉珍寳誤卯僅以八人應戰，然表演穩健可取，確較尋常爲佳，第二塲略現慌張。友聯自敗於復華後，大受打擊，昨晚主將陳梅貞大病方愈，勉力登塲，出球力量大减，陸兆珊匆匆自杭州趕來助戰，王務醴亦以家事心神不安，全隊表演，大失常態，得勝第二局，已非易事。</p>
<p>劇戰經過</p>
<p>第一局友隊楊文鵑發球，因對方過份緊張，連得五分，友聯賴朱錦芸之殺球，方得阻止友隊銳氣。十一比三，友隊獲易位權利。黃明媛屢以猛擊得分，王珊憑藉身長，有居高臨下之勢，第一局友隊以廿一比十勝。第二周友隊項毓琳開球，大受贊賞，最初局　平均，繼友聯以十一比七超出，形勢一變，頃刻成十五比八，友隊　　百出，廿一比十三，友聯亦勝一局。第三局　方決　，各三平手後，友隊脫頴而出，王珊名不虛傳，點扣得法，但友聯仍未見弱態，兩軍頗有難解難分之勢，結果友隊終以廿一比十得勝。</p>

<h3>銀根續鬆　行局差出一八三億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所繼續差出一八三億元，銀根續鬆，惟業內因物價連漲，籌碼短少，反現緊俏，故暗息仍喊二角，華股塲外多方貼息則减低至二角七分半，差出入細數中，中央出六四三億元，大交換入三六五億元，外商入二四三億元，小交換出四二五億元。</p>

<h3>臨收了結者多　華股高後見回</h3>
<p>華股昨熱股除信和華豐外，低後咸易回升，紗匯刺激之下，證金及大鈔之傳說又起，業中人出後紛進，尤以遞永紗及現永紗爲最，近午急切拉高，信和有巨多脫手，未免遜色。元老股商務增資，未能滿意，獨跌半成。景綸中紡亦然，未免美中不足。　晨初承前收餘風而見高，開後四四號二〇三號雖買，二三五號等脫手，六一號等賣出即交，自二七三元及二七七元起下挫至二六七元及二七二元。三六號一七三號趁低吸納，五四號一四號買現永紗，曾微升爲二七一元及二七六元。二二四號力供信和之後，最爲遜色，曾步降至二三二元及一三五元低價。永紗經九九號等力供現永紗，二二四號等脫手遞永紗，息價開出爲二角二分半及二角七，步降至即交二六四元，遞交二六九元低價。十一時後，紗匯助買，外股漲俏，流言助多，二二三號等買運永紗，二七號等力購現永紗，逐漸盤升至即交二七九元，遞交二八四元高價。經一三三號等脫手，四五號上四〇號賣現永紗，步回至二七六元及二七九元之價收市，收後喊低少許。結果較前收即交股計永紗美亞新光景福動興中法榮豐中絲微升，信和華豐內衣恒豐小挫，新華閘北中興火柴尙平，商務中紡景綸跌半成。遞交股計華　微挫，永紗信和美亞新光景福勤興微漲，場外各老股升沈不一，大生續降，中華小升。</p>
<h3>無許可證進口　外貨處琎問題　市商會提供意見</h3>
<p>本市市商會爲無許可證進口外貨處理問題，昨特電南京國民政府，政務委員會，行政院，全國經濟委員會云：無許可證進口外貨處理問題，聞將由政務會議決定。竊謂自備外匯進口貨，雖各有其不得已情形，但手續究有欠缺，加微關稅，略示制裁，似尙平衡，至繳納百分之五十押金，負担太重，商力弗勝，如轉嫁於物價，更恐影響民生。又調査自備外匯一層，資金已成爲物資，事後追求，於事無補，徒滋流弊。似以責成進口商加具切結，保證將來，較爲適當。敬祈採納施行云。</p>
<h3>食糖復緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市因傳週一台公司配價或須調整，故人心轉佳，價遂上展。公會劃盤，現貨二〇中砂白八十一二萬元，升二三萬元。四半車白九十四五萬元，台赤升三萬元，爲八十一萬五千元。汕帮黃崗靑六十七八萬元，棉赤七十一萬五千元，成交三百包弱。興化白升三四萬元，爲八十一二萬元。　莊七十八萬元至八十萬元。興赤高貨七十二萬五千元，次之六十七八萬元，計五百餘件。海南赤升萬元，爲七十萬元，計二百餘包。刁靑號方頗有售出，價較平，仍開六十四萬五千元，計三四百件。</p>
<h3>祁红外銷不多</h3>
<p>向銷歐洲之祁門紅茶，英國方面因嫌價昂，無力進購。目前瑞士等地，對於該項花色，尙爲靑一睞，惟出價緊縮，去化零星。汪一裕泰·午昌·新華·等茶葉公司一近方問津之本年度路莊婺源大帮，受貨主堅持不前之影響，交易仍少，但脚地比前堅硬。至於紅綠茶內銷，依然聯翩，情况活躍如故。</p>

<h3>胡志明的輪廓</h3>
<p>— 僑</p>
<p>號稱越南總統的胡志明，最近傳聞被捕，被殺，迄今都無法證實。現在簡略地介紹胡志明的生平，想讀者對這個風雲際會的人物，不會沒有興趣吧：</p>
<p>他於一八九〇年生於越南的藝靜，七八歲時，就常常替他父親傳遞秘密信件，聯絡附近革命家，年靑時代，看到一九〇七—〇八年黃花探領導的反法起義，一九〇九年東京法兵營毒殺案，一九一二年「三·二三」堤岸炸彈案，一九一三年「四·二三」阮錦江制越督薩勞案，和阮文素的河內起義，一九一四年張爾等之起義，他曾參加過秘密革命運動，旋因法方追捕甚急，乃化名改裝在海輸上服務，先後到過法·德·意·英·美·日各國，在法國參加共產黨，後又到蘇聯留學，後來我國，恰是北伐時代，未淸黨前，渠曾任鮑羅廷秘書，一九二七年，在港組織馬克思主義越僑小組，旋又組越共靑年團，終創立越南共產黨。太平洋戰爭後，渠在越立不住脚，曾　至我國南方各省活動，勾結中共破壞我國抗戰工作，旋在柳州為廣西當局逮捕，不久保釋。一九四五年春，回越發動對日游擊戰，是年九月二日，宣佈成立越南民主共和國，和臨時政府，安南王保大被迫辭職，流亡香港，一九四六年三月，改組臨時政府爲聯合政府。同年十月二十六日，召開所謂第二屆人民議會，通過越南民主共和國憲法，自任大總統，十一月三日改組政府，自任主席兼外交部長。</p>

<p>助手一面遵照主人的吩咐做着，一面私自竊笑主人的愚蠢</p>

<h3>蘇聯兩性行活</h3>
<p>— 柴扉</p>
<p>遊歷莫斯科的人，對於蘇聯處理一般戀愛事件，總覺得有點可羞，談起來也有點諱忌。影片中情人不准卿卿我我地親嘴。裸體石膏像居然也得以織物遮掩。當今通行的交際舞，男女之間的空隙，足以容納第三個人　入。如果我們想到不道德的面紗將蘇維埃的統治隱蔽過多時，那末所有這一切措施，原是不足怪的。後來爲了使家庭生活穩定，關於兩性關係，確曾有所更張。一九一五年，即布爾雪維克進軍莫斯科前三年，關於自由戀愛，列寗與他的摯友綺尼沙亞芒合作，以精神作戰的方式，將流行的浮濫觀念，加以澄淸。關於金錢，宗敎式階級的偏見需要解放，應該不成問題，因爲將來新統治的創造者必定頌揚這種種自由，但是兩性關係如只作浮面的維繫，顯然是不應加以擁護支持的，僅僅愛情與空洞的交誼列寗並不發生興趣。家庭的責任與義務，他認爲必須加以確定。對於生殖，他覺得傳統習慣，也有可取之點。</p>
<p>然而後來蘇聯對於這種指示顯然沒有邀行。當我十五歲的時候，在莫斯科所見到的一次結婚，簡單到只作一下登記而已，前後所需時間只三分鐘工夫。沒有證婚人，沒有人演說，也沒有人朗誦法律條文。</p>
<p>離婚則比結婚更快。只要一張卡片，上面略述兩造的心願即可。革命成功初年，打胎行爲完全合法。法律容許每個人自由結合，反過來也容許每個人毀滅他與她孕育成的新生命。</p>
<p>革命後好多年後，這種情形始完全改觀。雖然對於結婚的處理依然遵照革命後的新傳統，但是比較地說起來，已經莊嚴得多。禮堂普通也掛燈結綵，牧師也熱烈祝頌新婚夫婦的快樂幸福，演說也規定在結婚儀式之內；有的場合新婚也着白色禮服。儀式舉行以後，通常也用「伏卡酒」款待來賓了。</p>
<p>離婚也比較困難起來。必須有很嚴重的理由才能批准。協議離婚時還故意將履行的日期延長，以便男女兩方有反省自問的時間，在某種程度上並將離婚做到衆人皆知，這對於男女雙方再度結婚分明甚爲有利。凡提議離婚者應化費五百至二千盧布，以獲得對方的允許，打胎被認爲不合法，除非醫生認爲胎兒足以危害母體的生命，始准實行。</p>
<p>近年來蘇聯獎勵生育尤力，並深以此自傲，常局認爲此種措施誠不啻鞏固其蘇維埃組織的基礎，一個生了十個孩子的母親，政府即頒給「幗國英雄」的榮譽獎，養了七個，八個或九個的話，也能得到「光榮母性」的獎章。</p>
<h3>銀杏樹</h3>
<p>— 祝枕江</p>
<p>最近中國駐美洛杉磯領事以中國空運至美的銀杏樹一株，贈送洛杉磯南加省大學，　以增進睦誼，而對於該校設置中國文學獎金額，聊表謝忱。</p>
<p>銀杏樹在中國爲極普通的樹，而何以在國際間重視如此呢？關於這點，讓我慢慢說來。銀杏樹爲棵子植物。在株羅紀雖則到處生長，而在今日惟中國　有。其學名爲Ginkyo　biloba，這是爲數典忘祖的日本發音而來的。中國原名「鴨脚樹」，以其葉似鴨脚。或名公孫樹，因爲公種而孫收其果。宋代文人對於銀杏極吟咏的能事，因之銀杏便爲世人所重視了。</p>
<p>日本之有銀杏，乃由中國移去的。故在字典上稱爲異朝之木，而或說係鴨脚的轉訛。日本當在宋代方有銀杏之名，或云更早。</p>
<p>其往歐美，一七八〇年入荷蘭，一七五四年到英國，一七六八年至奧國。美國之看銀杏在一七九五年。德國詩人歌德Goethe氏之詠銀杏葉乃在一八一五年。</p>
<p>歌德自一八一五年九月八日至十五日在弗倫夫耳脫，以銀杏　一枚　贈給瑪麗阿納Mariane失人說：</p>
<p>「誰知道本來是一物，歧則爲二，合則爲一呢」。</p>
<p>這是歌德於邂逅瑪麗阿納夫人後要把銀杏的一葉聊寄別後的心情而發的啊。記得唐子祐題红葉詩云：「曾聞葉上題紅怨，葉上題書寄阿誰」。那末中國早有以葉寄意的故事了。而今弗倫克耳脫的霍爾志好生公園中依然有銀杏樹矗立着，就在德國咸那地方，也有歌德手植的銀杏樹一棵。據說此樹一身而兼有雌雄兩性，曾爲歌德研究變態植物學的資料。</p>
<p>總之歌德與銀杏曾結有不解之緣的。哈衣特爾堡爾　城內立有歌德的紀念碑，並有紀念的椅子。椅上刻有銀杏葉，椅傍植有銀杏樹。銀杏　詩人而聲價十倍，詩人遇銀杏而脈脈傳情。以西方名詩人而與東方的名樹成爲知己，道正所謂天道好合，而豈俗人所能明白的呢？</p>
<p>那末今日中國以銀杏樹寄贈美國洛杉磯的大學，這不僅是聊表謝忱而已！</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐的英雄崇拜</p>
<p>美國人是有英雄崇拜感的民族，他們崇拜一切稀奇古怪的人，我們所認爲英雄的大都偏於窮兵　武的人物，諸如關羽，岳飛，諸葛亮，明太祖之類。他們心目中的英雄，包括各種人物，下至雜耍大王，跳舞專家，哥而夫球專家，摔角家，大力士，都是英雄，在美國社會中祇有傑出人物才能得到大衆的歡迎，如無一技之長的庸碌人物，便不易在得到社會的靑睞，美國的社會是共同的，不是孤獨的，一個不受社會歡迎的人物，決不能孤零零地在美國生活下去，所以由海外去美國的人，至少要有一技之長，尤其在多才多藝的美國女性面前，你沒有勝過她的才能，你決不能邀致她的理采。你的一技之長並不囿於學術方面，倘如你在學術方面有卓特的造就，諸如著作了許多書，有科學上的發明，有舌辯的天才，擅長外交詞令，都能邀致美國小姐的垂靑，此外則你跳舞跳得最好，或則酒量宏，或則會講笑話，或則面皮極老不怕難爲情，或則善於玩弄女性，在美國小姐心目中都是値得崇拜的英雄，如果你在抗戰中有特殊的建樹，多殺了幾個矮子兵，在佔領區豎起一面國旗，在　荒之地强迫降落，那更是十足道地不折不扣的英雄，不但在馬路上有許多太太小姐走上來握手問好，甚至狂吻一陣表示敬慕，甚至踏穿了你家裏的門限，更有大量的毛絨衣，手帕，睡衣，枕頭套，從素不相識的小姐們送來，使你受寵若驚，不知所措。也有素昧平生的小姐，在第一封信上就提出婚姻問題。美國小姐是那麼率直天眞，她好像找到一個意中人之後，多等一天也是辦不到的，非立刻同居不可，由崇拜英雄進而佔有了英雄，這與中國小姐的退讓畏縮兀全相反。美國小姐崇拜了一個英雄，她決不考慮那位英雄的出身，甚至也不細究英雄的經濟狀况，祗要能達到佔有目的，死心塌地的崇拜一切皆非所問，英雄在中國是無用武之地的，一個沒有經濟背景的英雄，決受不到中國女性的崇拜。有許多解除了武裝的英雄，在街頭吿地狀，摩登小姐走過，不惜抬一抬眼皮，這些英雄如果到了美國，早被小姐們擁入綉　，崇而拜之，所以在中國祇有馬路英雄，英雄到了馬路上，彷彿虎落平腸，被人家當作煨　貓了。</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>値得推荐的二部英国片</p>
<p>上一週要，「孤星血泪」与「金錢萬惡」這二部英國電影，是値得向愛好電影世術的觀衆們推荐的。英國電影有它獨特的風格，當我們看膩了那一套浮而不實的美國影片時，英國片給你帶來新鮮的風格，無疑地他們所採用的寫實主義的手法是正確的。從過去的「相見恨晚」與「天倫之樂」等作品中，我們已經深切的感受了。同樣的「孤星血淚」，是有了更進步的成績。</p>
<p>「孤星血淚一是狄更司的名著，現在由英電影界的首席導演大衛李恩担任編導，他精確而洗練的處理了這部名著。尤其前半部戲的收獲，有着不朽的成續。</p>
<p>演員中，我更讚美那飾畢浦童年的小演員安東尼衛傑，他已經創造了超特的成績，約翰密爾斯的畢浦，范蘭歷霍蓀的艾斯德拉，文萊寇里的逃犯麥格維區也都有着優秀的演出。本片的攝影也是値得一提的。</p>
<p>另一張「金錢萬惡」雖较　於「孤星血淚」，但依然是一張優秀的文藝片。　　「芙蓉春色」一部娛樂片</p>
<p>「出水芙蓉」大爲呌座以後，这部「美蓉春色」一定也爲觀衆所喜歡的。雖然這部戲的劇本，脫不了那一套　愛故事，但編得還不怎樣庸俗，作为一部娛樂影片，那末，這部戲是可以一看的。</p>
<p>女主角伊漱惠蓮絲是銀幕上的漂亮女星，她擅長游泳，所以這部戲裏免不了要插入游泳塲面，但沒有精彩的表演。而且她又不會演戲，幾段較爲需要深度表演的戲，她就無法稱職了。男主角范强生成績，也甚爲平凡，倒是飾男歌星的勞雷茲梅査成績不壞，還有幾個配角，更佳於主演者。</p>
<p>偵控片「三更天」</p>
<p>這部片子描寫美國社會上那些特殊人物，亦算是偵探片的另一種寫法了。故事依然跳不出謀殺與戀愛這圈子。所以題材並不新鮮。雖然技術上顯得很平穩，導演者的手法平庸，也是這部戲的致命傷。</p>
<p>狄克鮑惠爾的戲尙見　健。</p>
<p>並不精彩的「基度山復仇記」</p>
<p>一部片子　製續集，總是較差於前築的。由於「基度山恩仇記」的曾哄動一時，所以才有這部「基度山復仇記」的攝製，也就是續集。但成續是差得太遠了。而且這一類片子在觀衆也是平已感到壓膩了。</p>
<h3>解恨妙法</h3>
<p>— 知非譯</p>
<p>如果「吵架」至少需要有二人，那末「和解」至少需要幾人？——這不是什麼猜謎遊戲，而是一個很重大的問題，如能加以適當的解答，可以避免世上不少的悲慘之事。</p>
<p>「吵架」是很易造成的：一句匆促的話，一個不小心的行動——它立刻就來了。隨即「自尊心」參加了進來，眞正的煩惱就開始了。盡情地，好好地吵一次架，其實並沒有大害處。把你心中所想的直說出來，往往可發生相當的好處。如果你對某一個人懷着怨恨，直說出來是比醖釀在心中，讓它惡化你們的關係好得多。</p>
<p>危險有害的，是吵架的後果。那種苛　的恨意和慍怒，那種不可屈伏的決心，會把當事人的生活弄得這樣難堪。所以讓我們直捷爽快地回答這個問題吧——「和解」只需要一人。如果你認為總是應該對方首先有所表示，請再平心靜氣的想想看！</p>
<p>爲什麼你不應該首先有所表示呢？你究竟是什麼人，必須把你的感情和自尊心看得這麼重要呢？——雖然對方不首先表示，也是愚蠢的。</p>
<p>「自尊心」多半是虛妄——建立於「自以爲了不得」的錯誤觀念上。所以，下次當你因吵架的後果而難過時，你應該費點心，首先有所表示，來終止那不愉快的，發　的情形。那時你會驚　地發見，對方是願意跑過大半段路來迎接你的。原來他跟你一樣，也一直在想作怎樣的表示而跟你和好如初——或竟比以前互相了解呢！</p>

<h3>Chairman and Wife Fly to Beiping, May Visit Northeast After a Short Stay, It is Said Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan are Rushing to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] Chairman Chiang and his wife flew from Nanjing to Beiping by special plane at 11 AM on the 4th, accompanied by Zheng Yanfen, Yu Jishi, and others. Before departing for Beiping, the Chairman summoned Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi at 9 AM and gave him instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] Amidst the tension in the Northeast, Chairman Chiang will stay briefly in the old capital to command nearby, and may visit the Northeast. Chairman Chiang, along with his wife, Zheng Yanfen, Yu Jishi, Cao Shengfen, and others, departed from Nanjing by special plane at 11 AM on the 4th, escorted by three fighter planes, and arrived in Beiping at 1:50 PM. Few knew about it beforehand, and only Li Zongren and his wife, Chen Jicheng and his wife, Sun Lianzhong, and He Siyuan were at the airport to greet them. After disembarking, the Chairman went to his residence in Houyuanensi to rest. Senior Beiping officials flocked to pay their respects. Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan, who had just flown to Beiping from Yulin, also paid their respects at 6 PM on the 4th, leaving at 6:30 PM. According to Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen, Chairman Chiang will stay in Beiping for a short period. The Beiping authorities only received a telegram about the Chairman's arrival in Beiping at 9 AM on the 4th, so the arrangement of the residence in Houyuanensi was extremely rushed, and even laying the cables was still in progress in the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] While in Beiping, Chairman Chiang may convene a meeting with university presidents, and the list is being drawn up by relevant parties.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] It is reported that after Fu Zuoyi flew to Yulin yesterday for inspection, he flew to Beiping from Yulin at 4 PM on the 4th. Deng Baoshan, Deputy Director of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, came with him to report on the defense situation in Yulin.</p>
<h3>National Army in Jiaodong Crosses the Sea, Lands on Nan Changshan Island, Fierce Fighting Along the Line from Muping to Haiyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] On the 3rd, under the cover of naval artillery fire, the National Army crossed the sea and landed on Nan Changshan Island (north of Penglai), occupying it, and is continuing to attack Bei Changshan Island.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Office, 4th] The National Army entered Muping on the morning of the 4th, and the remaining bandits collapsed eastward. The National Army in the Kui Jia Mountain area took advantage of the victory to advance and launched a mop-up operation in the mountain area. Kui Jia Mountain is the last stronghold of the Communist bandits in the Jiaodong area. Once the mop-up is completed, the bandit's mountain nests will be completely destroyed. The National Army is also advancing in multiple directions towards Wendeng and Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The National Army advancing towards the Shandong Peninsula is engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist bandits in the area near Muping to Haiyang. One unit is advancing towards Wendeng and Weihaiwei. Currently, there are about 2,000 bandits each in Weihaiwei and Haiyang, and the National Army is gradually clearing them out.</p>
<p>[Our Weixian Office, 4th] The area south of Changyi, west of Tingkou, east of Zuoshan, between the Weijiao and Weihe Rivers, and west of the Weihe River is currently the most intense battle area in Shandong. The Communist bandits have concentrated as many as four columns there, including part of the 9th and 13th Columns, which came from Jiaodong. The remnants of the 7th Column and 2nd Column, originally near Zhucheng, also fled north to join them starting on the 2nd, strengthening their forces in an attempt to prevent the National Army's encirclement. The National Army is launching a combined land and air operation to encircle and suppress them in the area.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 4th] Shandong has entered the stage of suppression operations. Since the main forces of the Communist bandits Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi suffered major blows from the National Army and successively abandoned their Shandong base, which they had managed for ten years, and fled south to the Yu, Wan, E, and Su areas, within Shandong, besides the remnants of Chen Yi's four columns in the area south of Changyi and east of Zuoshan, which the National Army is continuing to clear out, one column originally on the north bank of the Yellow River has moved from Deping to Dexian in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The other two columns, remaining in the area between Yuncheng and Caoxian in southwestern Shandong, have retreated towards the Dongping Lake and Liangshanbo area since the 2nd due to the National Army's attacks. The National Army is pursuing them, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them completely. Therefore, commentators believe that in order to successfully complete the military suppression of bandits in Shandong, the focus should be on passively destroying the Communist bandits' local administrative organizations, economic institutions, and remaining military strength, and actively rebuilding local armed forces to truly improve grassroots politics.</p>
<h3>Yantai is Almost Entirely Deserted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yantai, 4th] The Communist bandits have occupied Yantai for two years, and the market has become almost entirely deserted. Most stores have no goods to sell after resuming business. There is a severe shortage of sugar and fuel in the city. Although the power plant has been repaired, the coal stored in the power plant is only enough for ten days. The bandit currency held by the citizens has become worthless. The banks have not yet reopened, and the financial situation is suffocating. Postal and telegraph services have also not resumed, causing inconvenience to all parties. The authorities have telegraphed the Central Bank and the Postal and Telegraph Administration to resume operations quickly.</p>
<p>The Majestic Appearance of Yantai Port</p>
<h3>The Southern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Will Be Fully Open to Traffic Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] According to a phone call from the Hefei Command Post of the Second Pacification Zone at 1 PM on the 4th: "The southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is expected to be fully open to traffic on the 5th. Only the section of track from Guzhen to Suxian is being repaired. Two of the five bridges have been completed, and another three have been assigned to a 500-member engineering team to rush to complete them before the evening of the 4th. The reinforcements that were dispatched from Bengbu to the front have all returned to their original defense positions in Bengbu. The battle along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has come to an end."</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 4th] Telephone and telegraph services between Xuzhou and Nanjing were restored on the evening of the 3rd. Furthermore, wired telephone service between Nanjing and Xuzhou was restored on the morning of the 4th. The railway project between Suxian and Xisipo on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was completed at noon on the 4th, and the test run in the afternoon was successful.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 4th] There are no traces of bandits within 40 kilometers of Zhouyuan in Suxian. Traffic between Xuzhou and Haizhou will resume on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Recovery of Territory in Henan Province: Guangshan and Qixian</h3>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Office, 4th] Confirmed information: The bandits who fled to Wunüdian, east of Xuchang, have fled to Xiaoyao Town, southwest of Xihua, on the 4th, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] The National Army recovered Qixian at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th] Guangshan was recovered by the National Army on the 3rd. The combined forces of the Communist bandits Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns have only about ten thousand remaining.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dispatches Personnel to Hong Kong to Welcome British Delegation, Delegation to Fly to Nanjing Tomorrow, U.S. Military Inspection Delegation to Come to China from Korea</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] A British parliamentary delegation, led by Lord Ammon, will arrive in Hong Kong on the 5th.

The British Embassy has also decided to hold a press conference at 6 PM to introduce them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 4th] According to the British Consulate, the British parliamentary delegation, originally scheduled to fly from Calcutta to Hong Kong via Kunming on the 4th, detoured via Yangon to Bangkok on the morning of the 4th due to low-lying air currents over the Hump route between Kunming and Calcutta, hindering flight. On the morning of the 5th, they will fly from Bangkok to Nanjing via Hanoi and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] It is reported that a delegation from the U.S. Congressional Global Military Inspection Team (five Republican Congressmen and one Democratic Congressman), led by Curry, Chairman of the Congressional Military Subcommittee, arrived in Tokyo on the 28th of last month, met with General MacArthur, and inspected the troops. On the 2nd of this month, they flew to Seoul, Korea, and are scheduled to visit China on the 6th. Their itinerary is as follows: fly to Beiping on the 6th, fly to Qingdao on the 8th, fly to Nanjing on the 10th, and plan to meet with Chairman Chiang and President Zhang. Fly to Shanghai on the 11th, fly to Okinawa on the 14th, and transfer to Myanmar for Europe.</p>
<h3>Major Battle Expected North and South of the Huai River, Impossibility of Liu and Chen Bandit Forces Merging</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 4th] Chen Bandit's dream of crossing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to flee back to northern Jiangsu with his 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th Columns has been completely shattered. Forced to do so, they turned around and fled back to northwestern Anhui. Chen Bandit's 1st and 6th Columns fled to Taihe on the 3rd and continued to eye Fuyang. His 3rd and 8th Columns fled from the southwest of Suxian to the Mengcheng and Guoyang area on the 3rd. A strong group of National Army soldiers marching south from Yongcheng is joining forces with the National Army forces pursuing from the southwest of Suxian to launch a brave pincer attack on Chen Bandit. A major annihilation battle is expected north and south of the Huai River.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 4th] The main force of Liu Bocheng's remaining bandits has been driven from the Daxiao Mountain area to southern Henan by the National Army and has been cut into three sections. The main force of their 2nd and 6th Columns is currently surrounded by the National Army in the area south of Gushi. Their 1st and 3rd Columns and parts of the 26th Columns are being encircled and annihilated by the National Army in the Baiquanyuan and Shuanglun River areas south of Guangshan and north of Jingfu. Two to three thousand men from their 7th Column are currently trapped in the military encirclement in the Zhou Dangfan and Pan Xindian areas south of Luoshan. A military spokesman said: It is absolutely impossible for Liu Bandit to merge with Chen Bandit.</p>
<h3>Situation in Huanglong Mountain Unclear</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, 4th] After several days of fierce fighting between the defending army and the attacking bandits in Huanglong Mountain, Shaanxi, the situation is unclear. The National Army is currently rushing to support and attack.</p>
<h3>Bandits Harass Areas Near Xinghua, National Army Has Defeated Them</h3>
<p>[Our Xinghua Office, 4th] The situation in Baiju and Liuzhuang, two towns between Dongtai and Yancheng, has been unclear since the 30th. More than 300 bandits attacked Jianggou, 30 miles east of Xinghua, on the morning of the 3rd and collapsed after a counterattack by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Chengyang Fortress Adjusts Defenses</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Office, 4th] Kong Qinggui, Commander of the Jiangyin Fortress, went to Nanjing to request instructions from the Ministry of National Defense for the importance of the river defense. He has now returned to Chengyang and convened a defense meeting on the 4th to make precise adjustments to the defenses of Chengyang.</p>
<p>[Our Changshu Office, 4th] There is absolutely no concern for security in Jiangnan. The military authorities, in order to prevent the Communist bandit Su Yu's troops from fleeing, have specifically instructed the provinces, cities, and counties along the river to comply with the following four points: Coordinate with the Navy to strictly defend the key points along the Yangtze River in the garrison area. Eliminate scattered bandits in the Nanjing-Shanghai area and bandits in southern Anhui immediately. All Yangtze River vessels should be partially or fully controlled on the south bank according to the urgency of the situation to avoid supplying the enemy. Take special precautions on cloudy days.</p>
<h3>Night Battle West of Baoding City, Communist Bandits Retreat After Suffering Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Office, 4th] Local bandit forces gathered and harassed the outskirts of Baoding. There was fierce fighting all night west of the city last night. Two battalions of bandits attacked National Army strongholds in the Dache Town area, ten miles from the city. After the arrival of reinforcements from the National Army, they launched an artillery counterattack. The bandits suffered heavy losses and retreated west on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<h3>Our "Compensation and Restitution" Committee Investigates Japanese Industrial Equipment, About 100 Factories Available for Compensation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] Our "Compensation and Restitution" Committee has investigated nearly 100 Japanese factories in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya to prepare for receiving compensation goods. Some representatives of the committee will go to Osaka on the 5th to investigate four chemical factories there. The factories that Chinese representatives have already investigated in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya include 43 machine tool factories, 17 ball bearing manufacturing factories, 3 Changri factories near Tokyo, 19 shipyards, 8 steel factories, and 6 sulfuric acid factories.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] According to the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan, the first batch of Japanese compensation machine tools and related metal processing equipment totals 19,561 units, of which we drew 9,780 units, weighing approximately 40,000 metric tons. The above machine tools were dismantled from 17 existing naval and army arsenals that have not been relocated by the occupying forces. In terms of quantity, it accounts for 28.1% of all compensation machine tools, and in terms of value, it accounts for 28.5% of the total. However, the original valuation by the Allied Headquarters was too high, and representatives from China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines have proposed adjustment methods, which are currently being discussed. It is estimated that the machinery and equipment we have drawn may be shipped in November of this year.</p>
<h3>Measures for Handling Applications After Importing Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, Executive Yuan to Decide and Announce Implementation Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the post-application for importing various goods purchased and transported from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange, estimated to be worth more than US$40 million, the spokesman of the Executive Yuan said that the handling measures are currently being discussed by many experts and will be decided and announced for implementation soon. However, the ordering of these goods was not applied for permission in advance according to the law, and they were shipped to China without authorization, which is obviously inconsistent with the government's laws and regulations on trade and foreign exchange management. If permission is granted for import, the prerequisite is that the proceeds from the sale of these goods in the country will not be used to purchase foreign exchange on the black market, disrupting the financial market and affecting national interests. Some of these goods are daily necessities that are lacking in the country, and the government will pay special attention to the handling of these goods. Furthermore, the current value of these goods in the country is much higher than the profit calculated at the time of ordering. If permission is granted for import, how to avoid excessive profits and prevent continued operations is also under study. After the research is completed, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion and decision before implementation.</p>
<h3>Six Officials of the Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Area Enemy Property Bureau Illegally Claim Enemy Assets, Military-Civilian Supervision Group Orders Transfer to the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th] Six more people from the Hebei-Beiping-Tianjin Area Enemy Property Management Bureau, including section chiefs and specialists, were accused of illegally claiming real estate belonging to the Tianjin traitor Wang Dapeng.

They include Deputy Group Leader Zhang Jiabao, Section Chiefs Shang Dizhong, Wang Zengxuan, Specialists Xu Jinyu, Sun Jihong, and Staff Member Wu Weizhi. Zhao Yingda, the former leader of the Enemy Property Management Group, who was also sent to the court for illegally claiming traitor's property along with Yuan Chonggu, a senior adviser to the Baosui Office, has been declared not guilty by the court due to insufficient evidence. Furthermore, Chu Yonghong (a staff member of the Tianjin Reclamation Bureau), who handled the money in the Tianjin Che Yao fraud case, which has not yet been revealed, surrendered to the Supervision Group last night, and the case will soon be cleared up.</p>
<h3>Trade Plan with Japan, Steering Committee Sets Up a Group for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The Steering Committee for Trade with Japan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 4th, chaired by Yang Shuren, to discuss two important cases: The dispatch of business representatives to Japan. So far, five places including Chongqing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou have nominated candidates. Their qualifications and trade plans are being reviewed. Shanghai has not yet nominated anyone, and some people in the meeting advocated canceling its nomination, but it was decided to retain it. It was resolved to organize a review group to review the trade plans submitted by all parties. Regarding transportation, the Ministry of Communications will review it, and so on.</p>
<h3>Chairman Concerned About Military Medical Work, Performance Evaluated and Rewards and Punishments Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] It is reported that the Chairman is very concerned about the military medical work in the Northeast and Beiping-Tianjin areas, and has recently repeatedly ordered the strengthening of facilities to facilitate wounded and sick officers and soldiers, and to evaluate the performance of military hospitals at all levels, and reward and punish them separately. It is learned that He Guilu, Director of the Tianjin General Hospital, and Pan Baosong, Director of the 53rd Rear Hospital in Jinzhou, have been commended for their excellent performance, while military hospitals with poor performance have also been punished.</p>
<h3>Chairman Cables Congratulations on Portugal's National Day</h3>

<h3>Leader of Xinjiang Rebel Army, Talier Khan, Expelled, Commissioner of Altai Prefecture Returns to His Post</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 4th] Liu Mengchun, Chairman of the Propaganda Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, stated at a press conference today in response to reporters' questions that Usman, the Commissioner of Altai Prefecture, and his troops have returned to Altai, and the rebel leader Talier Khan has been expelled from Chenghua. Liu stated that since the government signed a peace agreement with the riotous people of the Ili-Tarbagatai-Altai area, affairs in the three areas are handled by the three areas before the formal entry of the National Army into the two areas. Therefore, Usman's return to Altai is a matter within the scope of the three areas, and Usman's entry into Chenghua in the fastest possible time shows that the people are extraordinarily supportive of him. The Altai problem is not a military problem, but a political problem. As for the consistent attitude of the National Army, it is to strictly abide by the peace agreement and not to enter any area of the three areas before the entire military problem in the three areas is resolved. Usman is the officially appointed Commissioner of Altai Prefecture by the government, and it is legitimate for him to maintain normal contact with the provincial government. If the Commissioners of the Tarbagatai and Ili Prefectures are willing to maintain normal contact with the government, the situation is the same.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 4th] Chairman Song Ziwen recently told reporters that the provincial government will start actively mining coal to meet current urgent needs. It is verified that Guangdong Province is rich in mineral deposits. According to the latest investigation report from the Department of Construction, 27 types have been discovered, including gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, tungsten, bismuth, antimony, lead, zinc, phosphorus, coal, graphite, petroleum, magnetic iron ore, arsenic, sulfur, gypsum, asbestos, mica, barite, pigment stone, glass sand, and shellfish, distributed in over 1,200 locations, with a total area of over 70,400 hectares. After the recovery, due to lack of capital and inconvenient transportation, many mine operators have been unable to resume operations. Recently, the prices of various minerals have been rising, and since Chairman Song intends to develop mineral deposits, many mine operators in various places have been planning to resume operations.</p>
<h3>First Northeastern Victory: The Fifth Division of Bandits Annihilated Southwest of Siping; Crack Troops of the National Army Continuously Enter the Northeast to Reinforce</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 4th] The National Army at Shuangmiaoz, 28 kilometers southwest of Siping Street on the China Changchun Railway, launched an annihilation battle yesterday. The most elite Fifth Division of Chen Zhen's Second Column of the Communist bandits was completely wiped out. The bandits fled from the south of Bamiancheng, with a small number of remnants fleeing back to Bamiancheng in disarray. Furthermore, Changgang and Quantou, important stations on the Changchun-Shenyang section, have fallen into the hands of the bandits. The National Army also made a planned retreat from Gongzhuling at 10:00 PM last night. Wherever the bandits went, bridges and sleepers along the way were either burned or blown up. There is absolutely no concern about the defense of Changchun City. Although the Communist bandits currently probing their advance towards Changchun from the two wings of Mengjiatun, artillery fire was heard in the city last night. However, military observers point out that, up to now, Changchun has only been under attack from the south, while the other three sides remain calm. Therefore, the Communist bandits' lack of ambition for Changchun is self-evident. Moreover, Changchun City's defenses are as solid as gold, and it is by no means something the Communist bandits dare to covet. The atmosphere and morale within the city are exceptionally peaceful. However, due to speculation by merchants, prices have fluctuated greatly.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 4th] The sixth offensive of the Northeastern Communist bandits is expanding. Troops from north of the Songhua River, Shandong, Jehol, and Hebei are being transferred to southern Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, and the major strongholds surrounding Pan Yang. It is reported that crack troops of the National Army from within the passes have been continuously entering the Northeast. The Beining Railway can be fully opened to traffic in the short term, which will be the key to reversing the situation. Shenyang has announced twelve articles of martial law, with death penalty for violators. Chen Cheng has instructed all parties to remain calm and suppress prices. (Note: Today, prices here have skyrocketed, especially for rice and flour. Many people have been arrested by the authorities for refusing to sell.) Chen Cheng also held talks with industrial and mining personnel on the 4th, with Northeastern elder Wang Shuhan also in attendance. He then met with Zheng Dongguo, who had just flown back from Jinzhou, listened to his report, and discussed current military issues. The power transmission line from Fengman Power Plant has been cut off by the bandits, suspending the transmission of 4,000 kilowatts of power, and a portion of the Tiexi factories have suspended work. The Communist bandits abandoned the stations of Shoushan, Lishan, and Lishan on the southern section of the China Changchun Railway on the morning of the 4th. Fierce battles are taking place outside Anshan, with the National Army firmly defending. Haicheng, a key town in southern Liaoning (120 kilometers from Shenyang), fell into the hands of the bandits on the 4th. A large number of Communist bandits are gathering in Niuzhuang, between Haicheng and Yingkou, posing a great threat to Yingkou and Anshan. Yingkou has suddenly reported heightened tensions. The emergency repairs to the Shiqiaozi Station on the Shenyang-Benxi line have been completed and will be open to traffic on the 5th. Fierce fighting is taking place at Zhonggu Station on the northern route. The Qinghe Bridge, five kilometers north of Kaiyuan, which had been painstakingly repaired with sleepers, was set on fire and destroyed by the bandits on the 3rd. The bridge is over 600 meters long and has suffered considerable damage. The Changtu military station has been abandoned, and contact with Kaiyuan was lost here after noon on the 4th. It is reported that it has fallen into the hands of the bandits. The National Army in Xifeng and Faku have both shifted defenses in recent days. A large number of bandits are gathering in the southwest of Xingcheng, with intentions to attack Huludao. Furthermore, the damaged section of the railway between Xinmin and Juliuhe has been repaired, and traffic on the Shenyang-Jinzhou section is scheduled to resume on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 4th] The Hou Jingru Corps advancing north along the Beining Railway has recovered Zihuang, the next station after Qianwei, and the vanguard has advanced to Wanghu Station. (Military officials' comments on the war situation can be found in the lower left corner of page two.)</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On the Prospect of Gold</h3>
<p>— Zhou Bodi</p>
<p>Why do countries around the world compete for gold, and even the socialist Soviet Union wants to retain gold? Generally speaking, it is because gold is an international currency, gold is the final payment tool between countries, and gold is a way to stabilize currency values. This is elaborated below:</p>
<p>Gold is an international currency. — Although the International Monetary Agreement did not create a new name for the international monetary unit, it stipulated that "the par value of a member country's currency shall be expressed in terms of gold as the common denominator, or in terms of the weight and fineness of the US dollar in effect on July 1, 1944" (Article IV, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the Agreement). This gold used as a common denominator will be generated under the Keynes Plan as member countries utilize their overdraft rights.</p>
<p>Gold is the final payment tool between countries. — Although modern international payments are made through exchange or clearing, the final payment tool is still gold. Therefore, the International Monetary Fund stipulates that member countries (more than 40 countries) should pay part of their quota in gold upon joining, and should sell their gold to the Fund under certain conditions in exchange for their national currency. Member countries can also sell their national currency to the Fund in exchange for gold. The Fund itself can also exchange the currencies of various countries for gold. Member countries' buying and selling of gold must not exceed the limits stipulated by the par value. In this way, the external value of each country's currency is linked to gold, and paper currency and gold have a great sense of "water color connecting waves, waves connecting the sky." In the future, gold will still be the final payment tool between countries.</p>
<p>Gold is a way to stabilize currency values. — In the future, gold will not be the true foundation of currency, but it will still be a way to stabilize currency values. To make gold the true foundation of currency, the gold standard must be implemented; this gold standard can be either the gold coin standard with free coinage as its backbone, or the gold bullion standard with unlimited buying and selling of gold as its backbone, both are acceptable. But in any case, in addition to free coinage or unlimited buying and selling, the free export or import of gold is still necessary. However, every country is willing to seize the gold of other countries, and mostly prohibits the export of its own gold. In this state, countries lacking gold cannot implement the gold standard, and countries with abundant gold are unwilling to implement the gold standard, because once implemented and the gold ban is lifted, gold will leak out. Without restoring the gold standard, the system of the Monetary Fund can still be used to stabilize the external value of currency. Stable external value will naturally be a driving force for stabilizing internal value.</p>
<p>In modern times, gold is more of a foreign exchange fund than a reserve for issuing currency. The external mission of gold will be more important than its internal mission.</p>
<p>Therefore, when it comes to gold policy, the most ideal thing is naturally for gold to be state-owned and used for external purposes. However, to implement state ownership of gold, confiscation would infringe on private rights and lose popular support; requisition would increase the issuance of banknotes and promote inflation; issuing gold bonds to exchange for gold would be subject to voluntary subscription and would not easily see immediate results. Therefore, state ownership of gold is not easy to implement for the time being, and there is no need to implement it temporarily. Because people absorb gold to preserve currency values, and because the absorption of gold raises the black market price of gold, this is certainly a loss for individual buyers, but hiding wealth among the people may not be a loss for the entire national economy.</p>
<p>The United States is a country with abundant gold. If it were to issue banknotes with all of its gold as reserves, it would definitely cause inflation. Therefore, the United States purchases gold that flows in. Purchases exceeding a certain amount are sold to the Federal Reserve Bank. The gold purchased is either allocated for storage or sold overseas. The price of this sale is $35 per ounce. This is the legal price.</p>
<p>Because the United States wants to prevent gold from having adverse effects on banknotes, it implements a gold sterilization policy, and selling gold abroad is one aspect of its gold sterilization policy. Therefore, its selling price is also particularly low. However, in the United States' free gold market, it is worth $42.75 per ounce. This is even $2.75 higher than my country's gold parity ($40). Fortunately, most of my country's gold is wholesaled at the legal price ($35). Although my country's parity is lower than the market price in the United States, it will not lose money.</p>
<p>The free price of gold in the United States is already above $42, and in places lacking gold, its free price will naturally be higher. For example, my country's parity is $40, while the free price in Macau is equivalent to $51. Even if this price is too high, $45 should be a very fair price, which is still $10 higher than $35. Generally speaking, gold prices in various countries around the world are higher than in the United States. According to incomplete figures, Mumbai has reached over $70, Cairo $108, and Athens $110. As for Chile and Brazil, they are closely following the United States, also at around $40. The higher the gold price, on the one hand, indicates a shortage of gold, and on the other hand, indicates a greater need for gold. Why is gold so needed? Isn't it because gold has the functions mentioned above?</p>
<p>In recent years, the people of my country have also particularly liked buying gold, perhaps due to inflation and the desire to use gold as a store of value. But in reality, inflation is not a strong reason for people to buy gold; because countries like Switzerland have not had inflation, but their people also like to buy gold. The price of gold in Switzerland is very high, and to export it abroad, a passport is required. Even so, the outflow of gold is still torrential. Therefore, since the beginning of September this year, the National Bank of Switzerland has stopped selling gold.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that gold still has its special functions in the future world. Except for the United States, which is willing to release a portion of its gold from the perspective of adopting a gold sterilization policy, the remaining countries are trying to collect gold, or passively prevent the loss of gold. Because the United States is willing to release a portion of its gold, gold prices have a parity point; because countries want to collect gold, gold prices have uneven peaks.</p>
<p>My country's current gold, although it cannot be state-owned, has been banned from free trading. Banning free trading means freezing gold, so that those who hold gold cannot exchange it for currency and circulate it on the market, which is helpful for currency contraction. However, gold is valuable but small, it can be hidden in sleeves without anyone noticing, and private transactions are difficult to detect. Therefore, although inspections are strict, the black market price is difficult to eradicate. The existence of the black market is almost unavoidable, but compared to the turbulent and surging public market price, its stimulus to prices is much weaker. The black market price of gold only plays a follow-up role on prices, it will not play a leading role. This is the biggest benefit of banning the free trading of gold.</p>
<p>Conversely, if we want to eliminate the black market and open up gold, then there will be one more stimulus to price fluctuations, another opportunity for speculation in the market, and more chips in the market, and the flames of inflation will be poured with flammable oil. Therefore, I believe that gold should not be opened up at this time.</p>
<p>However, there are originally two types of people who buy gold. One is the civilian class, who accumulate a small amount of funds and buy some gold jewelry on a regular basis to use as savings; the other is speculators or the wealthy class, who buy and sell gold in large quantities to seek profits. We can freeze and prohibit the trading of gold for the latter type of people, but from the standpoint of social policy, it is not appropriate to completely prohibit gold for the former type of people. (See my book "The Past and Future of Gold Policy")</p>
<p>Secondly, the suspension of gold trading by silver shops has caused many people to lose their jobs. Opening up the trading of gold jewelry would also be a way to provide relief.</p>
<p>However, the trading of jewelry by silver shops must be subject to appropriate control. This control should not be too strict (too strict will cause an imbalance between supply and demand), nor should it be too lenient (too lenient will cause many malpractices). This includes the issue of purchase prices. Now we assume that the purchase price for silver shops is the legal price of $40. Then those who are willing to exchange jewelry for silver shops will provide a source of gold for the silver shops. However, in the country, in addition to the legal price of $40, there may also be a black market (such as $51 in Macau). If the black market is higher than the legal price, then people will not be willing to sell gold to silver shops, and the silver shops will not be able to balance their buying and selling. At this time, the silver shops will inevitably hope to raise the selling price in order to seek supplies in the black market with their remaining profits, so that they can balance their buying and selling. In this situation, the silver shops will still have profits, but the most disadvantaged are the poor sellers, who have no choice but to sell their only gold at a low price due to the necessity of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether the purchase price for silver shops should absolutely be based on the legal price is worth discussing. I believe that as long as the quantity of purchases is controlled, the purchase price does not necessarily have to be based on the legal price. It is also okay to use the black market price. In this way, the selling price and purchase price of silver shops will not be too far apart, and buying and selling will be easier to balance.</p>
<p>The above method is equivalent to opening up the small-scale buying and selling of gold. Will this cause malpractice? I believe that this is okay. It is like building a dam on a river with a very steep slope to prevent the torrent from rushing down and protecting vast fields, that is the gold ban. But a small gate can still be opened in that dam to allow a small stream of water to flow continuously and irrigate the fields, that is the trading of gold by silver shops. Prices will not be stimulated to rise because of the rise in the price of gold jewelry. Because gold jewelry does not occupy an important position in the composition of the price index. The reason why the price of gold affects prices is because of its large-scale buying and selling, which affects prices through financial relations. Therefore, the price of gold alone (without going through finance) is not a collaborator of prices. This point also seems to be worth our attention.</p>
<p>The trading of gold jewelry by silver shops will be opened again soon, but because the buying and selling price relationship has not been settled, it seems difficult to recover smoothly for a while. According to the report on September 17, the purchase price is $40 and the selling price may be $68. The buying and selling prices seem to be too far apart. Needless to say, because the purchase price is based on the legal price, the selling price has to be raised even higher. However, as mentioned above, this may be detrimental to the poor and may instead easily promote black market transactions.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the free trading of gold should continue to be prohibited at this time, but the small-scale trading of gold jewelry may be opened up, and when opened, the quantity, form (made into jewelry), and quality must be strictly controlled, but it is not necessary to rigidly stipulate its purchase price.

<h3>Annual Meeting of the Institute of Engineers</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Mr. Ling said: This issue has been consulted with experienced supervisors and auditors in transportation, economy, resources, water conservancy, municipal administration, and other public utilities, and valuable opinions have been obtained for reference. Members are requested to express their opinions as much as possible. Yang Jiceng, Shen Yi, Ge Fuxiang, Xia Guangyu, Zhao Zukang, and others spoke in succession. General opinion is that the preventive attitude imposed on engineering by the current audit system should be reformed. The pre-audit should be changed to a post-audit, and the audits of administrative agencies and business agencies should be separated. In terms of personnel, the rigid way in which the Ministry of Personnel assesses talents based on their background and experience is considered unreasonable. It was decided to appoint Shen Yi, Zhao Zukang, Zheng Zhaojing, Lu Yujun, and Gu Yuzhen as examiners. Ling Hongxun personally convened the meeting to organize the conclusions based on the opinions expressed by the members, and then draft proposals for the general assembly to decide and submit to the government for adoption. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 pm.</p>
<p>At 2 pm, the various specialized engineering societies held group readings of papers. The papers of the Mining and Metallurgical Society included Zhou Zhihong's "Smelting of Iron" and Yue Dongxin's "High-Grade Acid Absorption Steelmaking Method for Smelting Poor Iron Ore." The papers of the Chemical Engineering Society included Chen 's "Gas Generation Equipment and Fuel Burning Equipment" and Fan 's "Coal-Fired Power Plant." The papers of the Aeronautical Society included Li Dingyi's "Calculation of Lift in Coherent Airflow." The papers of the Water Conservancy Society included's "Water Meter Annual" and Cheng Xuemin's "New Graphical Method for Flood Calculation." The papers of the Civil Engineering Society included Tang Zhizhi's "Working Stress of Timber in China." The papers of the Electrical Engineering Society included Shang's "Electronic Oscillation of Pentode Radar Tuning Tube." The papers of the Textile Engineering Society included Zhu Xianfang's "Developing My Country's Textiles to Lay the Economic Foundation for Industrialization," Jiang Yuanqi's "Research and Development Principles of China's Jute Industry," and Cai Niansu's "Research on American Dyeing, Printing, and Finishing Technology."</p>
<p>At 8 pm, there was an engineering lecture, with Hong Shen speaking on "National Railway Damage and Restoration" and showing a film.</p>
<p>Also: Zhao Zukang, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 5th. All members of the Shanghai Branch will return to Shanghai on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Original Text of Zeng Yangfu's Opening Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the Institute of Engineers' Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] The 14th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers opened in Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd. Zeng Yangfu, the president of the association, gave a brief opening speech, the original text of which is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>This annual meeting is the first annual meeting held by our Chinese engineers in the capital after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and its significance is particularly significant. I think all the engineers who participated in the annual meeting must have many thoughts.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen said: "After great destruction, there must be great construction." After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the national and people's public and private construction undertakings have been greatly damaged. Before the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the government announced the first phase of economic construction principles and drafted a five-year plan for material construction. President Chiang, in his book "China's Destiny," further proposed a ten-year construction outline and figures. Everyone hopes that post-war construction can start and proceed smoothly. However, just two years after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, construction calls have declined, which is inevitable. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>This is because the slogan of post-war construction has two weaknesses.</p>
<p>Two Weaknesses of Post-War Construction</p>
<p>First: the construction plan is placed on peaceful negotiations with the Communist Party. "Peace" and "construction" have become inseparable nouns. From the perspective of us engineers, it is correct to say that construction is good with peace, but it is absolutely wrong to say that construction is impossible without peace. The Communist Party is an uncompromising party, and it is impossible to live in peace with it. Therefore, waiting for the successful peaceful negotiations with the Communist Party before starting construction is certainly even more impossible. If construction projects can be carried out, the people will have the opportunity to find employment and live in peace. Those people who are held hostage by the Communist Party will return to the factories and back to the farmland, and will never be driven by the rebels again.</p>
<p>Second: the construction plan is placed on international assistance. A country must rely on its own efforts before it can cooperate with foreign countries. However, under the constraints of unequal treaties for the past 100 years, we have developed a national inferiority complex and a sense of dependence, hesitating and looking around, which has hindered our confidence in establishing an independent and autonomous material foundation for the country and the nation. Over the past two years, the years have passed, but the construction of our public works and the development of national industries have not made major achievements, and the crux of the problem has not been this.</p>
<p>Driving Force for the Revival of Public Works</p>
<p>The question we want to study today is how to implement a construction plan in a society of private property and free enterprise? By answering this question, we can understand the position and responsibilities of public works in the construction plan. The so-called public works include railways, highways, water conservancy, ports, docks, and other public buildings, that is, projects that mobilize a large amount of manpower and benefit the public interest.</p>
<p>After a long period of war, the contraction of production and the decline of social purchasing power are inevitable phenomena. In order to promote the post-war economic revival, the country should pay attention to three things: first, devote itself to national public works; second, increase the production of agriculture, industry, and mining and increase the people's labor; and third, promote export trade. The above three have a mutually cooperative relationship, and public works are the hub of the entire system. The country invests in public works to rebuild damaged areas, to prosper well-maintained areas, and to increase employment opportunities for the people. As the people's income increases, social purchasing power becomes abundant, and the production of agriculture, industry, and mining will inevitably increase, and export trade can be promoted. Therefore, the driving force for post-war economic revival is entirely tied to the construction of public works.</p>
<p>In industrially developed countries, the prosperity and decline of the social economy are cyclical. The prosperity of the social economy often causes overproduction, which ends in economic weakness. The country can use public works to alleviate this cyclical panic. If the country invests in public works, it can reduce the severity of social and economic problems. Therefore, public works have become an important balancing force in social and economic development. Economists in Britain and the United States have begun to attach importance to national public works in recent years. China is an industrially backward country, so we should devote all our efforts to the construction of public works as the driving force for post-war economic revival. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan was formulated after World War I, but his emphasis on public works is no different from that of the progressive economists in Britain and the United States after World War II. We are deeply proud of this prescient legacy, and we should study how we can implement it to restore the country's strength after the war. Today, I take this as my responsibility and encourage myself with it.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hu Shi's Letter to the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) The original text of Mr. Hu's letter is as follows: In my talks with reporters in Shanghai on September 5 and in Beiping on September 7, I talked about the ten-year plan to fight for academic independence, and mentioned the problem that the foreign exchange allocated to universities this year was too small. I cited the large amount of foreign exchange used for study abroad expenses this year as a comparison. Later, because several friends pointed out that the government's foreign exchange expenditure was more than just for study abroad, in mid-September, several reporters came to ask me. At that time, I mentioned several items about foreign exchange that I heard from friends in the South, one of which was that Mr. Feng Yuxiang and his colleagues received a total of 600,000 US dollars in one and a half years, and another was that the Resources Committee sent as many as 400 professional and technical personnel to the United States for investigation. Later, I received a letter from Mr. Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Resources, saying that "Mr. Feng was appointed to go to the United States to investigate water conservancy, and was approved to bring three secretaries and two water conservancy experts, a total of six people. The Executive Yuan approved the issuance of investigation fees three times, totaling 360,000 yuan in national currency and 50,200 US dollars in June of the 35th year, and 23,800 US dollars in July of the 36th year. The above total 360,000 yuan in national currency and 134,000 US dollars, all of which were directly allocated by the Ministry of Finance and notified to our ministry by the Executive Yuan." I also received a letter from Mr. Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, saying that "The Resources Committee has sent a total of about 400 interns to the United States before and after the war. Among them, the main ones are the Lend-Lease Act interns, who were handled according to the government's circular. After the North Heavy Machinery Plant met in May, due to the country's difficult foreign exchange situation, it immediately ordered all interns to return to the country early. More than 250 people have now returned to the country, and another 60 or so are waiting for a ship to return to the country. At present, there are less than 100 people still in the United States, and they will return to the country after the internship expires." I now formally request the Central News Agency to publish this letter for me to correct my mistakes last month. I take this opportunity to formally apologize to Mr. Feng Yuxiang and the Resources Committee. As for Mr. Feng Yuxiang's open letter about his buying houses and land, I never talked about it at all, so of course I don't need to answer him. Hu Shi, October 4, 36th year.</p>

<h3>Central Airlines Plans Traveler's Insurance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] The Central News Agency learned today from the Central Air Transport Corporation here that the company is planning to offer travel insurance to all passengers flying on its aircraft between China and foreign countries. Several well-known British insurance companies here have submitted applications to serve as the travel insurer for Central Airlines. However, the company has not yet decided which company will be awarded the contract. According to the company's plan, each passenger will pay an additional insurance fee for each HK$10,000 in coverage, in addition to the travel fare. The company manager said that all its flight personnel, including pilots, radio operators, and stewardesses, about eighty in total, are insured by the insurance department of the Jardine Matheson Company, with coverage of HK$50,000 per person.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Grain Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Grain prices in Wuhan City fell back today. Top-grade rice fell to 360,000.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] After the announcement of the increase in train fares, prices in Beiping today have burst like a dam, especially for daily necessities such as food, grain, and cloth. Today, first-grade flour is selling for 280,000, and top-grade rice has exceeded 7,000 yuan per catty. Forty-yard Indanthrene cloth is priced at 1.2 million. Dragonfly brand and Five Blessings brand have also risen from over 5 million around the Mid-Autumn Festival to 730,000. Coal is also being actively traded. Other metals, foreign goods, building materials, and other necessities are also rising in price.</p>
<h3>Prices in Xuzhou Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th] Prices in Xuzhou have skyrocketed. Today, top-quality fine cloth is 720,000 per bolt, white rice is 82,000 per斗, and kerosene is 3.1 million per large barrel.</p>
<h3>Prices in Qingdao Rise Madly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 4th] Prices in Qingdao City have risen madly in recent days. This morning, the opening prices for various goods reached a new high. 32-count Silver Moon yarn broke the 20 million mark, Double Dragon cloth reached 650,000, and Bingchuan flour was quoted at 280,000 wholesale, with retail prices exceeding the 300,000 mark. Rice was 850,000, and wheat tips were out of stock with no transactions. Kerosene has broken 3 million, and black indigo powder and caustic soda are both about to break 30 million. In addition, rubber, paper, western medicine, sugar, and tobacco are all rising steadily. The reasons are that the purchase and transport of food from producing areas are restricted, imports have decreased, and exports of yarn and cloth are brisk, leading to frantic buying. The resulting impact is that the price surge has become unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Northeast Improves Foreign Trade, Emergency Economic Measures Abolished</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] There is a major reform in Northeast foreign trade today. The Northeast Emergency Economic Measures Act, promulgated on May 10th, has been abolished by the Northeast Headquarters today. New measures have been promulgated for the export of soybeans and trade between Guan Nei and Guan Wai. Anyone exporting soybeans may apply for a permit by presenting an exchange settlement certificate and a letter of credit. For domestic sales of soybeans, restrictions have been imposed to encourage the soybean oil and soybean cake processing industry in the Northeast. The export of soybean oil and soybean cake is completely free. However, in order to take into account the domestic oil industry and avoid private enterprises competing for domestic sales, which would reduce exports, it is stipulated that domestic sales of soybeans are only allowed to be handled by the Central Trust Bureau or similar state-owned institutions. For general trade, except for the permitted and prohibited categories, all goods can be freely exported. All previous differential duties are abolished. In the past, exports to Guan Nei were subject to trade controls, while imports were free. Now, both exports and imports are within the scope of the plan and are allowed to be free. The Northeast lacks yarn, cloth, flour, kerosene, gasoline, newspapers, and麻袋. What it has in abundance are the metal materials listed in the permitted export category, such as raw steel plates, angle iron, iron pipes, copper plates, copper wires, copper pipes, and bamboo steel. Anyone importing materials urgently needed by the Northeast may apply to export the Northeast's surplus metal materials by presenting a shipping manifest, invoice, and tax bill. In this way, the main import and export goods will be mutually traded and sold, and remittances from the Northeast to Guan Nei can be expected to decrease, and prices can stabilize.</p>
<h3>Personnel from the Democratic League Participate in the Pseudo-Northeast Administrative Committee, Yan Baohang and Others Serve as Pseudo-Provincial Chairmen</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Sources say: The Communist bandits' pseudo-Northeast Administrative Committee was established on August 15, 1946. The full name of the committee is the Administrative Committee of the Pseudo-Northeast Provincial and Municipal Joint Office. It was elected by the "Northeast Provincial and Municipal Representative Conference" convened by the Communist bandits' Northeast Bureau in Harbin from August 7 to August 15, 1946. There are 27 administrative committee members, including Tibetans and Koreans. It is estimated that there are five members of the Democratic League among them. The pseudo-chairman of the committee is Lin Feng, the Communist bandits' Northeast Bureau Organization Minister and Director of the Political Department of the Pseudo-Northeast Democratic Allied Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, Lin was the Communist bandits' Jin-Sui Border Region Party Committee. After the surrender of the Japanese devils, he was sent by the Communist bandits to leave the Guan with Lin Biao, Lu Zhengcao, and others. The committee governs ten pseudo-provincial governments, four pseudo-municipal governments, and three pseudo-special administrative offices. Among the pseudo-provincial government chairmen, Gao Chongmin, Yan Baohang, and Yu Yifu, and the pseudo-Director of Education Han Tong (female), and Guan Mengjue, are all members of the Democratic League. From July 18 to the end of July this year, the committee convened its first administrative meeting in Harbin to discuss how to support the Communist bandits' rebellion in the Northeast in the future. The list of members of the committee is recorded as follows: Lin Feng, Lu Zhengcao, Zhang Xueshi, Zhou Baozhong, Zhou Jingwen, Gao Chongmin, Yan Baohang, Yu Yifu, Ning Wu, Han Tong, Che Xiangchen, Deng Dapeng, Feng Zhongyun, Wan Yi, Su Youwen, Liu Lanbo, Cao Hongjing, Chen Xianzhou, Li Du, Li Yanlu, Guan Yanjun, Jin Guangxia (Korean), Xu Shouzhen, Zhu Qiwen, Song Shende, Hafunga, Temuer Baya (Ha and Te are Mongolians), and 27 others.</p>

During that time, he met with Chairman Chiang and Marshall. This is his second visit to China.</p>
<h3>Macau Bans Gambling, Decides to Implement Gradually, Closing Three Gambling Tables Every Four Months</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 3rd] Portuguese Consul Carvalhais said: The Macau authorities are determined to ban gambling. Three gambling tables will be closed immediately, and the remaining nine will be gradually closed as well. The gambling ban plan stipulates that three gambling tables will be closed every four months, so that by the end of 1948, all gambling tables will have disappeared. The Macau government originally intended to ban gambling immediately, but in view of the fact that about 15,000 people rely directly or indirectly on gambling for their livelihood, sudden unemployment would endanger their livelihoods. Gradual prohibition will allow these people to gradually change their occupations. Macau has natural scenery, and the authorities plan to open it as a tourist area to attract tourists. The smoking of opium has been effectively prohibited since July of this year.</p>

<h3>Luo Longji Makes Another Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Luo Longji of the Democratic League entertained reporters on the evening of the 4th and made another defense against Huang Xianguang's remarks. He issued a written statement, attempting to deny everything regarding Yan Baohang and Zhou Jingwen. Finally, he said: "The Democratic League has its own independent political goals and its own absolutely independent policy. It opposes war and calls for peace. Even if there is any threat or oppression, the Democratic League will not change its original intention." When a reporter asked what they would do if the government asked them to go to the bandit areas, he replied that they would definitely go. At the same time, he advocated that the current domestic and foreign policies should be independent and autonomous, and should not rely on international aid. When the government wanted to announce the truth of the facts, he said: "It must be done with the participation of impartial people and international figures before it can be announced," which is mutually contradictory.</p>

<h3>Military Official Talks About Confidence in the Military Situation in the Northeast, the National Army Will Surely Win if it Takes Steady Steps</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] A certain military official said: The Communist bandits' sixth offensive was initially disadvantageous to the National Army, but everyone can rest assured that the military situation is absolutely under control. The bandits have now mobilized 300,000 troops in the southeast, northwest, and northeast, and it is possible to increase it to 500,000 to 600,000. The main force of the bandits is in the Meihekou and Xi'an area, with about 150,000 troops. The target of the attack may be the heart of the Northeast, the Shenyang and Kaiyuan area, and a major battle may occur in the near future. The bandits in Faku Xinmin pose a great threat to Shenyang, and the defense of Shenyang may be aimed at this. Of course, the northern relationship is also great. The stability of the manpower in Shenyang can explain the general public's confidence in the war. Huludao is safe and the transportation on the Beining Road will also be ensured. Land and sea supply will be sought to be smooth, and there will be factual performance in the near future. In addition, Changchun, Jilin, and Siping are all strongholds of the National Army in the north and will be maintained with all efforts. The purpose of the bandits' sixth offensive is nothing more than to attack the National Army, destroy industry, mines, and transportation, plunder the autumn harvest, and occupy cities. The biggest goal may be Shenyang. In short, the so-called sixth offensive may be longer than the two-month period of the fifth offensive, or it may be more tragic, but the National Army will surely win victory, secure the Northeast, if it takes steady steps.</p>
<p>Analysis of the Battle Situation in Henan and Shaanxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 4th] Military strategists analyze the battle situation between the provinces of Henan and Shaanxi, saying: The Communist bandits in western Henan are attempting to attack Tongguan along the railway and enter eastern Shaanxi, and to enter southeastern Shaanxi along the Luhe River Valley Xinxi (An) Jing (Ziguan) highway. These two moves have been severely attacked by the National Army. Tongguan is always as solid as a rock. What is more difficult to clear immediately is only the scattered bandits who are broken up into pieces in the mountain areas of Shangnan and Shangxian in the southeast corner of Shaanxi. Among the bandit units that have been discovered in western , the numbers of the brigades are 17, 31, 32, 33, 55, etc., which may not all be the bandit troops that retreated from the Longju Village Zhang Village (two kilometers southeast of Shangxian City) and Rencun (30 kilometers east of the city) line in Shangxian County, because the National Army is densely deployed in Lantian and Shangxian Counties, so a part of them may have fled south to the mountainous area of Shanyang County, and their route may repeat the mistakes of Li Xiannian's unit. According to the Chief of Staff of the Shaanxi Security Command, the six counties in southeastern Shaanxi, including Shangxian, that is, the Fourth Administrative Special District, have very strong defense capabilities, and the bandit army will never succeed. It is also learned that the rainy season in this area is coming to an end, and the opportunities for the air force to take action will increase, and the battle results will be greater. In addition, the people in Shangxian County are nervous, but the market conditions are normal. A curfew is imposed at 10 pm, and middle schools have been suspended. The Fourth District Commissioner and the county chief are supervising the construction of city defense works.</p>

<h3>Security Council Orders the Committee of Three to Immediately Resolve the Indonesian-Dutch Dispute, Batavia Consular Corps Reports That the Ceasefire Order Has Not Taken Effect, Gromyko Accuses the Netherlands of Being an Aggressor</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 3rd] The United Nations Security Council tonight passed Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's proposal by a vote of nine to zero, ordering the Committee of Three of Belgium, Australia, and the United States to immediately find a way to resolve the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The Soviet Union and Poland abstained. Earlier, the Security Council had received the report of the investigation team, which stated that there were still serious battles in the East Indies, as well as looting and killing of people, especially overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra. The Soviet Union's proposal that the Dutch and Indonesian troops simultaneously withdraw to their original defense areas was postponed to the next meeting on Tuesday for discussion. The Consular Investigation Team's report stated that in the current situation, the ceasefire order is difficult to fully implement, and the reason for the continued conflict between the two countries is the failure to demarcate the border. The report also stated that Dutch troops had invaded Indonesian territory in several places between July 20 and August 4. Between these invaded areas, there are still Indonesian regular troops and guerrillas. After the Security Council issued the ceasefire order, the Dutch and Indonesian governments announced that they intended to fully restore law and order within the defense lines they had designated, and disarm all armed organizations. The defense lines they designated connected the forward positions that they had invaded Indonesian territory with, thus including Indonesian regular troops and guerrillas within them. This line of defense is not acceptable to Indonesia, so skirmishes between sentries and guerrilla sniper attacks occur from time to time. This is the crux of why the ceasefire order cannot take effect.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chenggong Lake, 3rd] During the Security Council's discussion of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute today, Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a lengthy speech in Russian, in which he attacked "certain governments" for hoping to keep the Consular Corps' report strictly confidential. "The Dutch government's words and deeds are consistent, because the Netherlands has said that if the Security Council's recommendations do not suit its intentions, it will ignore them." He said that certain governments support the Netherlands. Without this support, the Netherlands would not dare to make such remarks rashly, nor would it dare to despise the Security Council's resolutions. Gromyko also accused the Dutch government of being an aggressor and reiterated the Soviet Union's demand that both sides withdraw to the positions they held before the start of the war. Gromyko said that the Indonesian people are suffering from abuse and that they are resisting an aggressor country, so their scorched earth tactics are justifiable. Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens then spoke, expressing regret to Gromyko for calling the Netherlands an aggressor. He said that the Committee of Three would be powerless until the violence stopped in Indonesia and a "good atmosphere" conducive to a solution was created.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 4th] The Dutch Aneta news agency learned that the US military observation team met with President Soekarno and Prime Minister Sjahrir in Yogyakarta today and is scheduled to return to Batavia on the 5th. The next meeting of the Consular Corps is scheduled to be held on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly Launches Fierce Debate, Britain Defends the Colonial System, Our Country's Representative Maintains a Fair Position</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 3rd] Colonial countries and countries without mandates engaged in a fierce debate yesterday in the Trusteeship Committee over whether colonial countries should include political information in their annual reports on the conditions of their "non-self-governing territories." Previously, the Egyptian representative proposed that the administering states should include information on the political activities of their non-self-governing territories in their annual reports, and the British representative immediately spoke in defense of the colonial system.</p>
<p>He said that reporting the political activities in non-self-governing territories to the United Nations would be tantamount to organizing an international political conference, thereby interfering in matters relating to the administering country and its colonial people. The Soviet representative immediately criticized the British opinion and called Britain a defender of the colonial system. Our representative Zheng Zhenyu believed that although the Charter did not expressly order the administering states to submit political information on the non-self-governing territories, in accordance with the spirit of the Charter, this report should be submitted to the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>India's Racial Massacre, Philippine Representative Suggests Forming an International Tribunal to Try</h3>

<h3>Debate on the Greek Question, Polish Representative Speaks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 4th Broadcast: Chenggong Lake News, The Political Committee of the General Assembly continued to debate the Greek question. The first speaker today was Polish Foreign Minister Lange, who said that the Greek question is serious in nature and has a significant impact on world peace. Anyone who studies this question should not focus on trivial issues, such as small-scale border disputes. The fundamental point of the Greek question is that foreign countries support reactionary elements and organize a government that is not supported by the people. The reason for the outbreak of the civil war is precisely this.</p>
<h3>The Palestine Question, Arab-Jewish Compromise is Difficult</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chenggong Lake, 4th] The debate on the Palestine Committee of the General Assembly, originally scheduled for today, has now been changed to Monday.

<h3>U.S. State Department Plans to Allocate 50 Million Dollars to France Within Two Weeks; Senate Democratic Leader Calls for Increased Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] It is reported that the State Department plans to provide France with $50 million in aid within two weeks. Meanwhile, President Truman held a cabinet meeting lasting an hour today to discuss plans for European relief and food storage. The source of funding for aid to France is currently unknown, but State Department officials believe that existing deposits can be used to prevent the complete halt of coal and grain shipments to France.</p>
<p>This $50 million, along with the $93 million worth of German-looted gold that France is expected to receive from the Brussels Three-Country Committee, will help France weather the critical period before Congress passes the $800 million interim aid package for France, Italy, and Austria. During today's cabinet meeting, the President and his cabinet members studied the recent report submitted by the President's Economic Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Waukegan, Illinois, 4th] Senate Democratic Leader Lucas told reporters on the 4th that the United States must be prepared to spend $10 billion over four years on Western Hemisphere defense unless Congress approves emergency aid to Western Europe by December 1st. He stated, "Europe is now extremely vulnerable to Communist infiltration, and if the Communist Party gains a foothold in the Western Hemisphere, we will face a real danger." He warned that if the Congressional committee hears the European relief plan and there are no results by December 1st, and then Congress is reconvened to consider the relief plan, it will be of no use.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Calls on Citizens to Conserve Food to Aid Europe; Luckman Drafts Concrete Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The U.S. government seems to have placed all its hopes for the urgent food needs of European aid on the voluntary cooperation of the American people. The restoration of wartime price controls and rationing is impossible, at least for the time being. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson broadcast the government's views on Friday, saying that if the voluntary approach is ineffective, everything will be in vain. Luckman, Chairman of President Truman's Food Committee, also plans to meet with representatives of the national brewing industry to seek their assistance in conserving food.

The final overall plan will be released next week after Luckman and his committee hold a meeting. Luckman is currently drafting this plan and hopes to complete it by the 9th or 10th.</p>

<h3>Britain Implements Employment Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The Ministry of Labour announced last night that the employment control system will be implemented starting next week. Under this system, British industries will be divided into three categories to determine their priority for obtaining labour. The first category is the main agricultural and industrial sectors with labour shortages, such as agriculture, coal mining, textiles, and steel industries. Other important industries, such as the atomic energy industry, although not lacking in labour, can also receive the same priority when vacant positions occur.</p>
<p>The second category includes major industries that do not receive priority in recruiting labour, such as the engineering industry, food manufacturing industry, hospitals, and laundry industries. The third category is non-essential businesses, such as the entertainment industry, personal services, and sports businesses. Those seeking employment should first be given positions in the first category of businesses; if there are no suitable positions in the first category, or the person refuses, they may be allowed to work in the second category of businesses; when there are still vacancies in the major industries, job seekers cannot join non-essential businesses.</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Reshuffle Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Attlee's cabinet reshuffle is facing difficulties. The new cabinet lineup was originally expected to be announced this week, but it is now learned that it has been postponed to next week. Changes to important cabinet members were announced on Monday, but there are still no suitable successors for secondary cabinet members. At the same time, some senior cabinet members who had already agreed to take up new positions are mostly unwilling to be transferred to new positions because they are unwilling to be responsible to a minority in the cabinet and only want to be responsible to the entire cabinet. Minister of Fuel and Power Shinwell and Minister of Health Bevan are said to prefer to withdraw from the cabinet rather than be transferred to secondary positions.</p>

<h3>British Trade Minister Wilson Declares Willingness to Rebuild Trade Relations with the Soviet Union; British Empire Decides to Reduce Imports from the Dollar Area</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Liverpool, 3rd] British Trade Minister Wilson told the Export Association here that the British government is prepared and very willing to rebuild complete trade relations with the Soviet Union. If the UK and the Soviet Union can establish a trade agreement, it will not only benefit the two countries but also be beneficial to the economic recovery of the world.</p>

<h3>Major Embezzlement Suspected in Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau; Xu Jizhuang and Thirteen Other Officials and Businessmen Prosecuted According to Regulations on Punishing Corruption, Indictment Divided into Three Points, Listing a Huge Amount</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Jizhuang, former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, Zhang Jiu, Director of the Business Department, Ni Shurong, Director of the Audit Department, Shen Jing, former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau's Shanghai Branch, Yu Zisong, former Deputy Manager, Zhang Zhirong, Accounting Section, Wu Yongnian, Head of the Business Section, Chen Gongpei, Compiler, Wang Xiangfa, Investigator, Li Liangfu, former Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Bachuan Bank, Jun Chuyi, Assistant Manager, Kong Guangxiao, former Chairman of Lida International Trading Company, Peng Bingcheng, Chairman of Yuanyang Trading Company, and other thirteen people, were previously reported to have suspected corruption. After investigation by Prosecutor Cao Hong of the District Procuratorate, the defendants were prosecuted according to Article 3, Paragraph 6, Article 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, Article 28, and Article 56 of the Criminal Law on the 3rd of this month. The original indictment is very long, and the general idea can be divided into three points: The part of the defendant Shen Jing and others. Regarding the purchase of remittances by the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, from November last year to February 2 of this year, remittances from Tianjin, Chongqing, Hankou, Kunming, Guangzhou, and other five places were purchased from the Shanghai Branch of Bachuan Bank, with a total amount of 3.65 billion yuan in national currency. Except for three drafts, totaling 800 million yuan in national currency, there are still eight outstanding remittances, totaling 2.85 billion yuan in national currency. Therefore, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau ostensibly buys remittances, but in essence, there is no factual remittance to other places, which is obviously a disguised interbank lending, taking advantage of the state bank's funds. The part of the defendant Shen Jing and Peng Bingcheng, Chairman of Yuanyang Trading Company. It was found that the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau operated 157 bills of exchange, totaling 8.677 billion yuan in national currency. Among them, 1.347 billion yuan in national currency was remitted between Shanghai and Shantou, and Yuanyang Company guaranteed 16 firms. After investigation, it was found that all were fictitious, made to secure advances. The part of the defendant Xu Jizhuang and others. On March 26 of the 35th year of the Republic, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau and Kong Guangxiao, Chairman of Lida International Trading Company, signed a foreign currency import advance contract. Kong provided collateral, which was handled by Shen Jing, the former manager of the Shanghai Branch, who was responsible for safekeeping. The outstanding balance of the trade was more than 175,000 US dollars, and Lida Company had not yet cleared the arrears. The Shanghai Branch returned the collateral to Lida, which was not without fraud.</p>
<h3>Savings and Remittances Bureau Sues for Fraud; Yuanyang Chairman Does Not Appear in Court</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau sued Yuanyang Trading Company and Bachuan Bank for fraud.

<h3>Speaker Pan Comments on the Selection of Senators; People from Both the Democratic and Youth Parties Are Welcomed to Be Elected; However, They Should Engage in Legitimate Election Activities in Accordance with the Law</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the request from the Democratic and Youth Parties to revise the current regulations of the provincial, municipal, and county councils based on the policy guidelines, so that people from both parties can participate in public opinion organs through selection, the Municipal Council has previously listed reasons from legal and factual aspects, and telegraphed the Central Government to reconsider this proposal, so as to avoid the government being suspected of destroying laws, valuing parties over the people. Wang Shizeng, the spokesperson of the Chinese Back Year Party, also issued a statement on the 2nd of this month to debate it. The reporter specifically inquired about the opinions of the Municipal Council on this matter. According to Speaker Pan: The main condition for democratic politics is the spirit of abiding by the law. The formal councils of provinces, cities, and counties are public opinion organs and can only talk about laws, not factions, and even less about human feelings. There are many talents in the Democratic and Youth Parties, and many of them are usually friends. We will welcome them if they can be legally elected as senators. However, it must be known that no matter what party or faction a person belongs to, if they want to be a senator elected by the people, they should engage in their legitimate election activities within the scope of the law, and cannot resort to government selection. The promotion of democratic politics is the responsibility of every national citizen, and there is no need to be a representative of a public opinion organ before one can talk about democracy. As for the generation of national senators, according to the regulations on the organization of the National Political Council, there are two types, selection and election. Moreover, the nature of the Political Council is originally to gather ideas and broaden opinions, which cannot be compared with the provisions of the regulations of the provincial, municipal, and county councils. If the Democratic and Youth Parties really want to participate in local public opinion organs and be selected as senators, they can only try it out in the temporary council at most, and they must not involve the formal council. As for the Democratic and Youth Parties using participation in the election of supervisory committee members as a reason, this point has already been stated by this council. There is no restriction on party affiliation for candidates for supervisory committee members, and there is no requirement that senators must be candidates.</p>

<h3>Hero Reaches the End of the Road and Is Exploited; Sent to Enlist as a Volunteer; Attempting to Cheat the Settlement Allowance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Yubao, 19, from Taizhou, was previously a soldier. Due to illness, he was hospitalized for a long time, and the team departed, which led to him wandering in Shanghai. Moreover, a set of clothes was also stolen by villains. At this point, he had no clothes or food and became a beggar. A few days ago, he was tricked by three thugs, Chen Keyun, Jiang Liming, and Xu Ziming, into the Longmen Hotel, where he stayed for two days, and promised to introduce him to a job. In reality, they sent him to the Penglai District to enlist as a volunteer, attempting to cheat the settlement allowance. Later, Wu Yubao noticed it. He had an argument with Chen Keyun and others on Qunshan Road the previous morning. The matter was heard by a rickshaw coolie, who secretly reported it to the Xujiahui Police Station.

<h3>Shui Xiangyun and Others Visit Director Wu, Discussing Ways to Improve Rationing Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, along with union directors Liang Shuizhang, Qiu Changjiang, Zhang Ziheng, Zhou Fujiang, and others, visited Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. They stated that the cost of living index for workers this month has increased by 10% compared to last month, while the index for staff has increased by 15%. The reason is that workers have in-kind rations, but in fact, most factories have not applied for rationing to avoid trouble. Workers have not received the in-kind items, but the index is compiled based on the ration price, regardless of whether the rations are distributed or not. Therefore, although factories save on procedures, workers suffer greatly. Furthermore, vocational workers do not have rations. The Social Affairs Bureau was asked if there were any remedies. Director Wu stated that most factories had already received their rice rations. Regarding oil and coal briquette rations, the Civil Food Allocation Committee had repeatedly issued orders and published advertisements urging factories to apply and pay to collect them. 257,000 dan of coal briquettes were prepared, but only 150,000 dan have been collected so far, with no one else applying. Factories voluntarily giving up applications is not a crime, and the Social Affairs Bureau cannot force them. However, the workers are the ones who suffer, so it is hoped that the General Labor Union can notify the various labor unions to cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to urge factories to take responsibility for applying for rations. Although the application period for the first phase of coal briquette rations has ended, supplementary applications can still be accommodated.</p>
<h3>Workers' Coal Briquette Rationing: Four Points Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau made a statement yesterday regarding the rationing of coal briquettes to industrial workers in the city. He said that the second phase of low-priced coal briquettes was originally scheduled to be completed by September 15th, but was later extended to September 25th, and the Civil Food Allocation Committee would issue all purchase permits before September 30th. However, the coal briquette factories refused to accept payment, citing that the ration price was too low. This has been strictly corrected, and payment will still be collected at the original price of 28,000 yuan per dan, and goods will be issued upon presentation of the permit. The following methods have been agreed upon with the Civil Food Allocation Committee:</p>
<p>*   All factories that applied before September 25th will be rationed if the procedures are complete.</p>
<p>*   For purchase permits issued before October 2nd, the payment and collection date will be extended to October 10th.</p>
<p>*   For purchase permits issued after October 3rd, if payment is not made to the coal briquette factory and goods are not collected within seven days as required, it will be considered a voluntary abandonment.</p>
<p>*   All coal briquette factories must collect payment and issue goods upon presentation of the permit. Any refusal will be severely punished.</p>
<p>The above methods have been publicly announced and ordered to be followed by the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association.</p>

Judge Zhong asked if he knew that the captured bandits in Li Antai's kidnapping all claimed him to be the leader and whether kidnapping Li was his idea. Su replied, "That's not true." When asked if he knew Dai Moshui and Su Huabing, Su said that he only knew Su Huabing, but they had a long-standing feud, so he falsely accused him. The court ordered that the victim be summoned to court for a retrial.</p>
<h3>Five Peking Opera Theaters Cancel Night Shows Yesterday: Performers Strike in Anger Over Treatment - Returning to Normal Today, Awaiting Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The five Peking opera theaters in the city, Tianchan, China, Huangjin, Dawutai, and Gongwutai, were forced to cancel their night shows last night due to a sudden strike by the performers demanding improved treatment. Tianchan suffered heavy losses due to audience disturbances. The Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to mediate last night, and both labor and management agreed to resume work today and await mediation. Therefore, all theaters will perform as usual today.</p>
<p>The performing troupes of the five Peking opera theaters consist of more than 600 people. In the past, they all had fixed salaries, averaging between 680,000 and 700,000 yuan per person per month. In recent months, they have requested a change to the cost of living index, and after repeated discussions, the management has agreed in principle. However, the labor side initially insisted on a base salary of 60 yuan, and later repeatedly reduced it to 45 yuan, while the management only agreed to 35 yuan, and no compromise was reached. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties for inquiries on this matter and scheduled another negotiation for tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of labor and management negotiated again at Tianchan. Those present on the management side included Wang Qijun of China, Tang Pingfan of Tianchan, Fan Hengyu of Dawutai, Zhang Shanshan of Gongwutai, and Zhou Xiru of Huangjin. The labor side included Qiu Yucheng, Wu Sibao, and Guo Qingpeng. According to the labor representatives, Wang Qijun of the management insisted that the base salary could not exceed 35 yuan during the negotiation. The Tianchan side was quite willing to increase it to 40 yuan, but the other four companies insisted on 35 yuan, and misunderstandings arose in their words. After the labor representatives Qiu Yucheng and others reported the negotiation process to the public, the crowd was indignant and went on strike in anger.</p>
<h3>Where is Dr. Mei? Teacups Thrown on Stage</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the weekend and the third performance of Mei Lanfang's "Hong Zong Lie Ma" at the Tianchan Theater. From 3 PM, audiences lined up at the Tianchan Theater to see Dr. Mei. The third floor was full before 5 PM. Waiting until 7:30 PM without the show starting, the audience on the third floor began to yell, then threw teacups at the stage, and threw long benches down from the third floor. Fortunately, the front-row audience had not yet taken their seats, and only the stage footlights, fans, and chair seats were slightly damaged, and no one was injured. At China, Huangjin, Dawutai, and Gongwutai theaters, the theater management, upon learning of the performers' strike, posted notices and requested the police to maintain order and assist in handling ticket refunds, and no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Loss of 200 Million Yuan - Rights to Compensation Reserved</h3>
<p>According to Zhou Jianxing, manager of the Tianchan Theater, yesterday was the last day of Mei Lanfang's "Hong Zong Lie Ma" performance, and all the tickets had been sold out. The loss of ticket revenue alone reached 105 million yuan. The remaining losses, such as the salaries of front-desk staff, backstage workers, rent, water and electricity, celebrity performance fees, and ticket printing, are incalculable. At the same time, China suffered losses of 40 million yuan, Huangjin 30 million yuan, and Gongwutai and Dawutai each had 30 million yuan. The management expressed to Zhu Chenghao and Ge Mengsong, who were sent by the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, that they reserved the right to demand compensation for such losses.</p>
<h3>The Strike Is Not the Labor Side's Intention</h3>
<p>The person in charge of the Linge United Association, organized by the labor side, told reporters that the management had no sincerity and stopped the performance automatically, resulting in this deadlock. This was definitely not the labor side's intention. The association further pointed out that there were also contradictions between the management, because the business conditions of each theater varied greatly.</p>
<h3>Cholera Outbreak Discovered in Zhangjiangzha, Nanhui County</h3>

In August of the 34th year of the Republic, he was reassigned as the Chief Prosecutor of the fake Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<h3>448 Million and 680,000</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "performing troupe" in Peking opera theaters includes extras, stage managers, musicians, costume keepers, and martial arts performers. In addition to earning a monthly salary of 680,000 yuan, they receive nothing else and must provide their own food and lodging. On the other hand, the performance fees of "Beijing big stars" are considerable. According to insiders, the distribution of performance fees for Mei Lanfang's troupe's performance at the Tianchan Theater this time, was as follows: Mei Lanfang 400 million yuan, Yang Baosen 120 million yuan, Xiao Changhua 80 million yuan, Li Duokui 70 million yuan, and Qian Baosen 40 million yuan. If the theater is sold out, it can earn 140 million yuan per day, including 5,000 yuan for tea and 2,000 yuan for programs. Therefore, calculated in this way, the sum total of 40 days, even if discounted by 20%, can reach 4.488 billion yuan. The labor side believes that compared with the 680,000 yuan they earn, there is a world of difference.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jixian Buried Yesterday - Solemn Memorial Service Held at Zhuangyan Temple in the Morning - Wu Tiecheng Delivered Eulogy</h3>

As a young man, he asked to join the revolution, assisting the founding father. The Battle of Hekou was a remarkable display of bravery. Failing in that endeavor, he went into hiding. Studying abroad, he achieved great academic success. Hunan raised an army, and the Han banner was easily planted. Summoned by the founding father, he entered Zhong Mi. Failing the Gui Chou revolt, he secretly entered southern Yunnan, where he ultimately realized his ambitions, overthrowing Yuan to restore the country. Geng Yan paved the northern road, Han Qi defended against Western Xia. As a military advisor, he promoted harmony among neighbors. There was further turmoil, hindering his efforts. Remaining loyal despite the obstacles, he faced the enemy. He participated in political affairs and finally achieved victory. Humble despite his merits, he refused to take credit. His discussions were clear and praised both at home and abroad. In this difficult time, with red eyebrows everywhere, we depend on experienced people to uphold righteousness. But heaven does not pity us and has taken away this wise man. The yellow bell has stopped ringing, and we miss his good voice. The evening waves of Dongting, the night rain of Xiaoxiang, the orchids will forever be fragrant, but where is his figure? I and the gentleman were allies in our early years, and even in times of hardship, we always remained devoted and sincere. We spoke late into the night in Sichuan and made tacit agreements in Shanghai. Our hearts were like clear water, sharing the same mysterious taste. Remembering the past, it feels like another world. The autumn wind is bleak, and the autumn rain is continuous. I sit up at night, as if hearing a sorrowful melody. Jixian, Jixian, how can my feelings stop? May your spirit be present here." Respectfully eulogized by Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan.</p>

<h3>French Tram Workers' Strike Resolved - Eager Resumption of Work and Resumption of Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The French Tram Workers' Strike, which lasted for a week, was resolved at 4:30 PM yesterday. Twenty-two red buses, thirty trolleybuses, and forty-five trams have gradually resumed operation. According to Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Section Chief of the Mediation Section stationed at the union by the Social Affairs Bureau, almost all of the 2,700 employees of the French Water and Electricity Company have agreed to resume work unconditionally. Only about 30 people are unwilling to resume work, and it will be regarded as a waiver of the right to resume work, and the company will recruit unemployed workers to fill the positions.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai newspapers published advertisements for the French Tram and Electricity Company's recruitment of new workers yesterday, there was a sea of people in front of the company's gate from 7 AM yesterday, and more than 3,000 people applied to register to work. The French workers knew that they could no longer persist in the strike, so they took the initiative to ask the Reorganization Committee to have Yun Long, Yang Jingen, Ye Jizhou, Cai Quanfa and others visit Director Wu Kaixian to request a final mediation opportunity. Director Wu agreed to extend the deadline to 5 PM. Yun Long and others left and then separately persuaded the workers to resume work. At around 3 PM, more than 700 workers from the Motor Department first went to the factory to resume work, and more than 200 outside workers from the Vehicle Department also came to the factory to report. The staff stationed at the factory by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Reorganization Committee of the Union instructed the drivers and ticket sellers of the Vehicle Department to first go home to change their uniforms and then come to the factory to work. At the same time, a red bus and a trolleybus were dispatched to Shanghai West and Shanghai South to pick up workers from the Vehicle Department to come to the factory. At around 4:15 PM, the workers were all wearing yellow uniforms and came to the factory in succession. The company authorities distributed ticket boxes and keys and assigned work. The first Route 22 bus (Zhao Hui No. 14988) left the factory to resume operation at 4:25 PM.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Older Workers Gather to Seek Work</h3>
<p>More than 340 unemployed workers of the French Water and Electricity Company expressed their willingness to replace the striking workers at the beginning of the labor unrest. The Social Affairs Bureau and the company authorities also attached great importance to these skilled unemployed older workers. However, after all the original workers resumed work, the company no longer had any vacancies to accommodate these unemployed workers. At around 3 PM yesterday, while the company was busy with the resumption of work, the unemployed workers also came in groups to request the Reorganization Committee of the Union to provide them with work. After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Workers Welfare Committee sent personnel to explain and persuade them, they left, agreeing to discuss with all parties again today to decide on the proper handling.</p>
<h3>Post-Strike Arrangements for New Workers - To Be Decided After Consultation</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 new workers who went to register for employment yesterday have completed the registration and verification procedures (registration was stopped at 3:30 PM, and more than 2,000 people had not completed the registration procedures), including former workers from the China Tram Company, the British Tram Company, and unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear. The issue of post-strike arrangements for these workers will also be decided today by the Social Affairs Bureau and the company authorities after consultation.</p>

<h3>Safety of Resuming Workers Guaranteed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau personally went to inspect the new worker registration site of the French Tram Company yesterday morning and went to the company to deal with general issues. In the morning, many workers declared to the company that they had no resentment towards the government or the company, and that they had been unable to resume work in recent days due to threats. They asked the company to notify the government to guarantee the safety of resuming workers, so that they could resume work in the afternoon. Director Wu stated that if workers came to the company to resume work before 4 PM, their safety would be absolutely guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Registration Continues Today</h3>
<p>According to Director Wu, by 4 PM yesterday, workers who had registered to resume work at the French Tram Company accounted for seven-tenths of the total. Some workers still requested to resume work after the 4 PM deadline. It has now been decided that registration can still be processed today (the 5th), but it needs to be reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with the company. If it is confirmed that they are good workers and were forced to strike under threat, they can still be allowed to resume work with the agreement of both parties. However, those who have been habitually misbehaving or have engaged in inciting strikes will not be allowed to resume work for the time being.</p>
<h3>Lu Jingshi Talks About the Labor Unrest Problem</h3>
<p>Lu Jingshi, consultant to the Ministry of Social Affairs and chairman of the Workers' Welfare Association of this city, made the following statement yesterday on the problem of labor unrest in this city: "The labor unrest in this city in recent days is purely the result of communist elements lurking in the labor sector attempting to use the power of the masses to make a final struggle after the government arrested them. Fortunately, by concentrating our efforts and responding calmly in recent days, the communist's cunning plan has been completely defeated. The majority of good workers understand that the government's measures are entirely for the sake of maintaining production and workers' interests, so they have accepted the advice and resumed work entirely, and the labor unrest has ended. I sincerely hope that the workers in this city will be cautious and vigilant and will no longer lightly believe rumors. If there are still workers in the labor sector who have been coerced into joining communist organizations, I also hope that they will immediately surrender themselves, and the government will treat them with leniency and give them a final opportunity to rehabilitate themselves."</p>
<h3>Four Workers Suspected of Meeting in a Park Are Detained</h3>
<p>[Special Report] At 7 AM yesterday, more than 100 workers from the French Tram Company gathered at the Bund Park for a meeting. The Garrison Department dispatched the Third Investigation Brigade after hearing the news. The workers claimed that they were discussing the resumption of work. Among them, worker Ma Guohua, who had previously been fired by the company for inciting labor unrest, was immediately arrested by the Garrison Department. The remaining three workers, Yan Jiazhen of Route 11, Qu Xizhong of Route 33, and Li Zimin, ticket seller No. 795, were taken in for questioning due to their suspicious behavior. As for the 96 workers who were arrested the day before yesterday for collectively destroying trams, after investigation, it was found that all but 31 were good workers, and they were released one after another yesterday.</p>

<h3>Ancient Pagoda Overlooking Today's Battlefield – From Huaiyin, Watery Lianshui to...</h3>
<p>[Report from Lianshui by our correspondent on the 1st] General Zhang Xuezhong, former Deputy Commander of the Third Front Army, was among the first group, along with General Tang Enbo, to fly to Nanjing and Shanghai to accept the surrender after the victory. The vivid impressions that General Zhang gave people during the early days of the War of Resistance in the Battle of Nankou, the Battle of Taierzhuang, and the counter-offensive battles of Liuzhou and Guilin in the later stages of the war are still deeply etched in everyone's minds. In March of this year, after firmly defending Lincheng, he came to northern Jiangsu to take on this arduous responsibility as the Commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area.</p>
<p>Commander Zhang</p>
<p>When interviewed by reporters, he put forward the two guidelines he insisted on: First, to universally and closely connect with all levels of society, and work together to fight against and suppress the bandits. Second, within the troops themselves, to actively strive for mobile warfare to crush the crafty bandits' old tricks.</p>
<p>The security of the canal route is mostly the responsibility of the self-defense forces, while the stationed troops set out at any time to suppress the bandits as opportunities arise. The canal line, from Huaibei to Xuzhou in the north and Jiangdu in the south, is now very stable, and transportation is also very safe.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the people, the Huaihai Pacification Area has now begun to handle it. As Commander Zhang said at the opening ceremony of the Huaiyin People's Movement Cadre Training Class: "Preventing bandits and suppressing bandits has now become as necessary as fire prevention and theft prevention in our daily lives."</p>
<p>Not long ago, in the Battle of Xumatou, the National Army, with less than a regiment, completely annihilated the Huaihai Military District Guard Regiment, said to be the most elite unit of the bandit army in northern Jiangsu, numbering over a thousand men. They also killed one regimental commander, one political commissar, two battalion commanders, and one commissioner (Wu Jue, the puppet Sixth District Commissioner), and two county magistrates (Chen Naitong, the puppet Huaiyin County Magistrate, and Chen Yachang, the Lianshui County Magistrate). Li Yimang, Chairman of the puppet border region government, luckily swam away. This battle is considered a tough one among the pacification campaigns in northern Jiangsu. The reporter arrived in Lianshui, which had been recovered for almost a year. Tiles and bricks littered the ground.</p>
<p>Two Scenes of Lianshui (Top) Miaotong Pagoda West of the City (Bottom) Desolate Streets (Photo by Song Shou)</p>
<p>Surrounded on All Sides</p>
<p>Lianshui is still shrouded in an atmosphere of tension and desolation.</p>
<p>Looking at Lianshui County as a whole, Lianshui City is located in the southwest corner, more than two hundred li from the coast in the northeast. In fact, Lianshui City is really too desolate. The market is not as good as a small town in Jiangnan, and the population is only over six thousand people, including two thousand refugees from the countryside. It takes five days to see newspapers from Nanjing and Shanghai, and the total sales of all newspapers are only forty-two copies, with our newspaper having the most, but only ten copies were sold. Here, it must be added: among the forty-two newspapers, only two subscribers are shops, and the rest are for government agencies to read.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, prices are cheap. Fish only sells for three thousand yuan per catty, but few people can afford it.</p>
<p>The terrain of Lianshui is too good, easy to defend and difficult to attack. Now, the city defenses of Lianshui are unnecessary.</p>
<p>General Zhang Xuezhong, Commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area (Photo by our special correspondent Ling Songshou)</p>
<p>The Lian-Huai Highway</p>
<p>is both flat and stable, because this highway is tightly夹住by the ancient Yellow River and the Grand Canal, forming two natural defensive lines. Therefore, although bandits across the two rivers often roam, they ultimately dare not cross the river.</p>
<p>The ancient pagoda west of Lianshui City is said to be near Nengren Temple. This pagoda is named Miaotong Pagoda. A year ago, the entire 74th Division launched</p>
<p>the Battle of Lianshui</p>
<p>and paid a great price near this pagoda, because the pagoda was very tall, and the bandits mounted two heavy machine guns on it, with fierce firepower, making it very difficult to break through. This pagoda has been heavily shelled by our army. It is riddled with holes, and its body is injured. The reporter and Staff Officer Gao Yushan climbed to the top of the pagoda on foot, looking out endlessly. North and south of the pagoda, the waves were surging. Near the pagoda, crops covered the ground, and the autumn wind was strong, with heavy rain threatening. Accumulation like…, I gazed at the cemetery of the fallen soldiers of the 74th Division behind the pagoda, which contained more than seven hundred martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country and the people, and could not help but smell the desolate and tragic atmosphere.

<h3>Chairman of the Sui Province Assembly Discusses Border Affairs with Peng Xuepei, Urgently Hoping the Central Government Pays Attention to the Northern Defense Line</h3>
<p>[Report from Guihua by our correspondent on the 4th] Peng Xuepei, Sun Yueqi, and their party arrived in Sui on the 3rd. Chairman Dong, Zhang Changqin, and Rong Xiangyu, the Comfort Envoy, all went to the station to welcome them. After Peng and others got off the train, they immediately held talks with the leaders at Director Fu's residence. Zhang Qin, Chairman of the Sui Province Assembly, presented three matters to Peng:</p>
<p>The people of Sui Province endured suffering for the country during the War of Resistance and the suppression of bandits, bearing extremely heavy burdens. To date, they have received less than two billion yuan in relief, but the burden of the people in just one item, ten thousand pairs of heavy shoes, is already over three billion yuan.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Yimeng</p>
<p>is beyond description as "severe." Hundreds of thousands of people fear they will all die of freezing and starvation this winter. They hope the central government will provide substantial relief. The people of Suiyuan understand the issue of Mongolian banner autonomy most deeply. The Mongolian and Han people of Sui Province have lived together in harmony for nearly three hundred years. The Japanese invaders instigated the autonomy of De Wang's Bailing Temple. Now, the vast majority of Han people in Suiyuan sincerely support</p>
<p>Mongolian banner autonomy,</p>
<p>but only with the banner as the autonomous unit, under the jurisdiction of the province. Otherwise, the league is equal to a special banner of the province and is also directly under the central government. Then the same province will be divided into four and five, and the consequences are unimaginable. Suiyuan is the foremost line of national defense. The strength of one province cannot achieve national defense construction. They urgently hope that the central government will pay attention to this northern defense line. The people of Suiyuan today can barely defend themselves, because the people's organization and training have been quite successful under the leadership of Director Chuan and Chairman Dong in recent years. At present, in order to maintain</p>
<p>Security in the Sui Region,</p>
<p>the self-defense forces in various places cannot be ignored, but the people are extremely lacking in self-defense firearms. They hope the central government will allocate firearms, or the people can purchase them themselves. Peng greatly appreciated the various items presented by Zhang and promised to convey them to the central authorities.</p>
<h3>Qingdao China Textile Factory No. 6 Repair Project Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>[Report from Qingdao by our correspondent on the 4th] The dispute over the repair of the boiler at the Qingdao Branch of the China Textile Corporation has been reported in detail in previous newspapers. Now, the person in charge of the branch told the reporter: The No. 6 Textile Factory under the branch originally had a 30-ton C.T.M. boiler. When the Japanese managed it, gas was used as fuel. Once, due to a burst in the boiler tube, the gas could not be shut off in time, causing the "dry boiler" to burn. All the boiler tubes were bent due to overheating, and the damage was extremely serious. After the takeover, the factory began to repair it. At that time, only a portion of the boiler tubes were replaced for makeshift use, which always affected production. The engineers of the factory's mobile department believed that only cutting off more than ten boiler tubes above the water pipe and replacing them with new tubes was a temporary relief measure. In order to achieve a permanent solution, a thorough overhaul had to be carried out to replace all the boiler tubes. After construction started, everything went smoothly within two months. Unexpectedly, in August, the factory workers and engineers had a disagreement, involving the method of boiler repair. To ease the situation, the branch authorities transferred the original technician Chen Laisheng (Technician Chen had been transferred to the Qingdao Power Plant to participate in turbine repair work) back to the factory to work in the middle. The method was still carried out according to the original overhaul plan. It is now known that this overhaul project will be successfully completed around the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office Asks for Heavy Troops to Eradicate Drugs</h3>
<p>[Report from Chengdu by our correspondent on the 2nd] The smoking and drug problem in Sichuan Province has not been eradicated, especially in eastern Sichuan. The Sichuan Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office has requested the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters to appoint personnel to lead heavy troops to patrol and eradicate. In addition, all counties and cities in Sichuan have begun to universally register smokers. According to a reliable investigation, the total number of smokers in the province is about 1.2 million. The reporter also learned from the person in charge of anti-smoking: The reasons for the difficulty in eradicating smoking and drugs in Sichuan are: The Yi affairs problem has not been thoroughly resolved, and the situation in the border areas is complicated. Corrupt and sheltering law enforcement officials, and the large number of drug offenders being powerful local figures make progress difficult. For example, the recent dismissal of the Pingshan County Magistrate for offending a wealthy family in anti-smoking eradication is one example. Financial difficulties, and a lack of anti-smoking funds make planning mostly empty talk. The central government has now decided to designate the next fiscal year as a period of general inspection, and executive personnel at all levels will be required to issue certifications, but whether the anti-smoking policy in Sichuan can be completed as scheduled depends on the efforts of the executive personnel.

<h3>Wild Boars in Groups Eat Rice at Night, About 200 Acres of Farmland Damaged</h3>
<p>[Report from Jinshan source by our correspondent on the 2nd] In the northern and southern townships of this county, hundreds of wild boars have recently been found, eating crops in groups. The damage is no less than a locust plague. Especially in the northern part of the county, from the Kaoshui and Yao Village sections to the Fo'erling, Gaocang, and Xinyuan areas, the damage is the most severe. About 200 acres of land have been damaged, with losses of no less than 50 million yuan. Although farmers in the village go out to jointly resist, because the area where the pigs hide is vast in the mountains, mostly forests, they come every time when the stars and moon are bright. Each time, dozens of pigs gather, led by the largest one in front, and the rest follow behind. People drive them away, but they do not disperse. If they are shot with guns, they are afraid of encountering angry wild boars. They want to prevent them, but sigh that they are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>According to an old farmer surnamed Hu who spoke to the reporter: The wild boar's greatest enemy is the jackal. Jackals like to eat pigs. The method of eating is to gather a large number of jackals. When they see a wild boar, the jackals urinate, sprinkling it on the trees and leaves. When the pig touches the urine, it immediately becomes blind. The pack of jackals chase the pig to a flat open area, where they insert their front feet into the pig's anus and into its abdomen, digging out its liver and intestines and hanging them on the roots of trees. The pig runs madly in pain. Soon, the intestines and blood are exhausted, and it dies. The pack of jackals gather and eat it. Therefore, wild boars know when jackals are coming and rush to go far away. In ancient times, wild boars harming crops meant that the year would be fierce and rice prices would be high. After the pigs eat the crops, the jackals must chase them, removing the harm for the people. Previous evidence can be relied upon and is invariably accurate. The farmer's words are as follows, so I will record them together. (Special correspondent Yu Ningpo)</p>
<h3>Fujian Education Director Uncovers Fraud, Zhu Zhen Impersonates to Seek Employment, Sent to Security Department for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Fuzhou by our correspondent on the 4th] A fraud to seek employment has occurred here. A person named Zhu Zhen claimed to be Zhu Jiahua's nephew, forged Zhu's letter, and instructed that he be seen by the Fujian Education Director Liang Longguang to seek employment. Liang discovered that the letter of introduction and Zhu's handwriting and seal were very different. Under strict questioning, Zhu admitted that the impersonation was true. The Education Department then sent personnel to his hotel and found a public letter forged with the seal of the 63rd Army. He was immediately sent to the Security Department for interrogation. According to his confession: he had served as a lieutenant colonel deputy regiment commander and other positions.</p>

<p>[Report from Suzhou by our correspondent on the 4th] The corruption case of Shen Kai, the former director of the Land Rent Office, was transferred to the local prosecutor's office by the county government. All branch office directors in various townships were summoned for questioning. As a result, due to the seriousness of the circumstances, they were all released on heavy bail. Among them, Zhu Shiqiong, director of the Xietang Branch Office, had already been sentenced to seven years in prison by the local court for a case of coercing rent with weapons and scaring a child to death. Now he is also involved in the Shen case and will not be without guilt. He attempted suicide out of fear, leaving a suicide note. Fortunately, he was rescued and survived.

As a result, Zhu Shiqiong was released temporarily with a written guarantee of 30 million yuan from two shop guarantors.</p>
<h3>Qiongya Party and Group Meeting to Prepare for the Establishment of a Construction Research Association</h3>
<p>[Aeronautical Report from Hainan Island by our correspondent on the 1st] The Qiongya Party and State authorities held a joint Party and State meeting at the Commissioner's Office on the 27th of last month. Those present included many cadres, executive members, and supervisors of the Qiongya Regional Headquarters of the Youth League and the Qiongshan County Party Headquarters. Commissioner Cai Jinjun, a cadre of the Central League Headquarters, presided over the meeting to discuss the merger of the Party and the League. The following was resolved: To organize a joint Party, government, and military meeting to assume responsibility for promoting all work on the island. To establish a Hainan Island Construction Research Association. To expand the organization of the Qiongya Bandit Suppression and Village Protection Association Headquarters and strengthen the work of suppressing bandits and protecting villages. (Another dispatch) At about 8:00 PM on September 24, the Sixth Detachment of communist bandits led by Fu Zhi, and the police team of the Democratic Government of Lingao County, with about 300 bandit soldiers, equipped with nine light machine guns and two grenade launchers, suddenly attacked Jialai City, which belongs to Lingao County. At that time, the only troops stationed in the city were more than ten self-defense team members from the township office and a detachment of the county assembly team. Although outnumbered, they calmly defended the stronghold to the death, displaying their power and counterattacking the bandits. The two sides fought fiercely for seven hours. In this battle, one bandit detachment leader and more than twenty bandits were killed. Our squad leader Hong Wendou suffered a severe leg injury. During the battle, because the city area was vast, our troops could not be deployed in small numbers, resulting in many shops being robbed, with losses of about 200 million yuan. Two citizens were killed, and twelve gentlemen, including Fu Qirong, were taken away by the bandits due to lack of preparedness. Also on the 24th, the Chen Wuying detachment of bandits, numbering about 300, was completely surrounded. On the 25th, we completely occupied the area, and the bandits fled in a panic. It is reported that about 200 bandits were killed or wounded in this battle.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Middle School Student Vocational Interest Test</h3>
<p>[Report from Fuzhou by our correspondent on the 2nd] The Fujian Provincial Department of Education recently conducted a survey of middle school students' vocational interests. According to the statistics, among junior high school students, the desire to engage in business accounted for 18% of the total, ranking first. High school students mostly aspire to practice medicine, accounting for 13.9% of the total, ranking second, followed by teachers and businessmen, each accounting for 8%. Female students generally like to be teachers, accounting for 24% of the total, which may be a manifestation of women's natural love of "education." As for cultural undertakings, journalism, and lawyers, they are not among the areas of interest of young students. It is noteworthy that administrative officials and tax officials, who were once considered good positions, are also not of interest to young students. The Provincial Department of Education is now conducting close research based on the materials in order to provide guidance and correction in response to the real psychology of young people.</p>

<h3>Talking About National Tung Chi University in Autumn: Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</h3>
<p>Looking at the verdant Northern Mausoleum cypresses and pines, and the leisurely white clouds above the Hanqing Building, I think of Northeast University (東大) as a forlorn youth, silently pondering in the boundless autumn scenery.</p>
<p>After my visit to National Tung Chi University (車大), Acting President Liu Shuxun Guang Sheng told me: "Every difficulty other schools have, National Tung Chi University (東大) has as well. The problems National Tung Chi University (東大) faces are problems that all universities across the country face. However, National Tung Chi University (東大) alone faces difficulties that other schools do not have.”</p>
<p>He gave an example: The problem of winter coal is not so serious in Shanghai (　　). The winter coal fund requires 500 million in circulating vouchers. This is a huge sum. According to him, when Minister Zhu came to Shenyang, he promised to find a solution, but the funds have not yet been allocated. Looking at the sparse buildings of National Tung Chi University (東大), without coal, it is impossible to live through the winter.</p>
<p>Minister Zhu's conclusion after inspecting the Northeast: He said that National Tung Chi University (東大) was in the worst state of recovery. The students and faculty of National Tung Chi University (東大) were very unhappy to hear this. They were full of complaints, saying that the worst was a certain Receiving Commissioner Wang, not the entire university. Wang was responsible for the school's building repair work, colluding with contractors to commit fraud, making a fortune, and now living leisurely in Beiping. Mr. Zang Qifang should of course be held responsible. This matter directly caused the student unrest this spring. Terrorists took the opportunity to act, and a hand grenade was thrown on the concrete floor of the Hanqing Building. A dozen students were thrown into the black prison. I went to see the site of the explosion. The mark of the grenade looked just like a student had accidentally dropped an ink bottle, but the color had faded. The original building could be said to be extremely solid. The repairs are not uniform, the roof leaks, and the doors and floors are also damaged. It's a pity. What is being "repaired"?</p>
<p>On the surface, National Tung Chi University (東大) looks like a desolate garden, overgrown with weeds and brambles. Minister Zhu's impression may have been affected by the chaotic exterior. Moreover, because the students were surrounded by too many difficulties, the students in turn surrounded Minister Zhu. Although Minister Zhu's generous promises relieved himself of the situation (　), the students were still surrounded by difficulties. Minister Zhu left, leaving the students with the temptation of hope.</p>
<p>National Tung Chi University (東大) has five colleges with more than 2,800 students, more than 500 new students this autumn, and more than 200 graduates this summer. Among the five colleges, the College of Law and Commerce stands out, with nearly a thousand students. The College of Engineering has the fewest students, with only over 200. According to people in the school, because the science and engineering courses in the puppet Manchukuo were shallow and only focused on providing technical training, high school students entering the university find the courses in the College of Engineering difficult to keep up with, and they are all considered daunting. Most of the graduating students this year have already found employment. The graduates of the College of Engineering have better prospects. The Northeast needs talent everywhere. The employment rate of university graduates in Guan Nei (關內) is only about 50%!</p>
<p>Students have difficulties, and professors also have difficulties. A series of problems and misunderstandings are intertwined. The Northeast is a war zone, and prices are higher than in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hebei, while the salaries of national university faculty are uniform. So who would want to come to the Northeast to teach? Because of the issue of hiring professors, students misunderstood Acting President Liu. Before Minister Zhu, they said that National Tung Chi University (東大) was not a College of Engineering, and they demanded that first-class educators preside over National Tung Chi University (東大). Acting President Liu was originally the dean of the College of Engineering, and it was naturally easier for him to hire professors from the College of Engineering than to hire professors from the College of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Professors are troubled by the uneven levels of students, making it difficult to find a consistent standard. The general English and Chinese proficiency of students is low. English has to be taught in two groups, A and B. Group B teaches high school courses, and other courses also use Chinese translations as much as possible.</p>
<p>Students eat two kinds of meals. Publicly funded students who have returned from the interior eat rice, four dishes and one soup. Many students who have enrolled in the Northeast are students who have fled from bandit areas and have no assistance. Publicly funded students are willing to share the hardship with self-funded students, eating sorghum rice and one vegetable dish. Such a difference creates an invisible psychological boundary.</p>
<p>Two thousand male and female youth refugee students from Andong are living in a corner of National Tung Chi University (東大). They have no schools or books. For two months, they have been wandering on the grass or dozing on the floor, impatiently whistling or pondering. In the summer, they fled in thin clothing, and winter is coming. Their appeals have nowhere to go, and tears cannot keep them warm. I asked a little girl if she missed her home. She ran away with red eyes. The students of National Tung Chi University (東大) are considered lucky compared to these refugee children.</p>
<p>Seeing National Tung Chi University (東大) struggling in difficulties, we silently wish it a new life. National Tung Chi University (東大) has made great progress from an agitated spring to a refreshing autumn, and can now be said to be on the right track.</p>

<h3>Textile Control Commission Prepares to Implement Joint Yarn Distribution, Starting with Cotton Inventory Registration, Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves Removal of Restrictions on Northward Transport of Cotton Yarn</h3>

<h3>After President Zhang's Meeting with the Governor of Hong Kong, Financial Agreement Will Be Gradually Implemented</h3>
<p>[Our Report] President Zhang of the Central Bank returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of the 3rd. Yesterday, he told reporters that he had met with Hong Kong Governor Grantham and his financial advisors several times in Beijing to discuss matters related to the financial agreement and customs agreement, and the results were very satisfactory. After the financial agreement was signed in mid-August, the reason for its failure to implement was the British announcement that the pound could not be freely exchanged for US dollars. At the same time, the Chinese side's announcement of new foreign exchange measures had an impact on the US dollar portion of the agreement. Therefore, the Hong Kong government hoped to postpone the implementation date of the agreement. However, as a result of the discussions in Beijing, it was decided to continue to study the US dollar portion, while implementing the other portions as soon as possible. The Governor of Hong Kong has decided to start preparing detailed implementation rules upon his return to Hong Kong. It is expected to be announced and implemented within two weeks. Regarding the customs agreement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted with the British Embassy and reached an agreement. The original plan was to sign the agreement after the British government had approved the text. During this trip to Beijing, the British Ambassador informed me that the British government had revised and approved the text of the agreement and sent it out, and it was already on its way. As soon as it arrives, it can be signed. The Chinese government attaches great importance to anti-smuggling. If the customs agreement is signed soon, it will greatly help with anti-smuggling work.</p>

<h3>Many Closing Positions, Hua Shares Rebound After Reaching Highs</h3>
<p>Except for Xinhe and Hua Feng, most of the hot Hua shares rebounded after falling to lows yesterday. Stimulated by yarn exchange rates, rumors of funding increases and large banknotes rose again. Industry insiders sold off and then bought back in, especially the forward Yong Yarn and the spot Yong Yarn. It was urgently pulled up near noon, and Xinhe was less than satisfactory with a large number of sales. The veteran share, Commerce, had an unsatisfactory capital increase, falling by 5%. Jinglun and Zhongfang were also the same, which was not entirely satisfactory. 　Chen initially inherited the previous closing momentum and reached a high, but although No. 44 and No. 203 were bought after the opening, No. 235 and others were sold off. Nos. 61 and others were sold and delivered immediately, falling from 273 yuan and 277 yuan to 267 yuan and 272 yuan. No. 36 and No. 173 took the opportunity to buy low, and No. 54 and No. 14 bought spot Yong Yarn, which slightly rose to 271 yuan and 276 yuan.

Yong Yarn was vigorously supplied by No. 99 and others, and No. 224 and others sold forward Yong Yarn, and the interest rate opened at 2 jiao 2.5 fen and 2 jiao 7, falling to a low price of 264 yuan for immediate delivery and 269 yuan for forward delivery. After 11 o'clock, yarn exchange rates helped buying, foreign shares rose, rumors helped a lot, No. 223 and others bought Yun Yong Yarn, No. 27 and others vigorously bought spot Yong Yarn, gradually rising to a high price of 279 yuan for immediate delivery and 284 yuan for forward delivery.

<h3>Import Without Permits: Foreign Exchange Handling Issues, Opinions Provided by the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of foreign goods imported without permits, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city specially telegraphed to the Nanjing National Government, Political Affairs Committee, Executive Yuan, and National Economic Council yesterday, stating: The issue of handling foreign goods imported without permits is reportedly going to be decided by the Political Affairs Conference. It is our humble opinion that although those who import goods with their own foreign exchange have their own unavoidable circumstances, the procedures are indeed lacking. It seems fair to impose a slight customs duty as a form of sanction. However, requiring a deposit of 50% is too heavy a burden, exceeding the ability of businesses to bear. If this is passed on to commodity prices, it is feared it will further affect people's livelihoods. Furthermore, investigating the source of foreign exchange after the fact, when the funds have already become goods, is of no help and only creates malpractices. It seems more appropriate to require importers to provide a written guarantee ensuring future compliance. We respectfully request your adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Tightens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market improved because of rumors that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's allocation price might be adjusted next week, leading to rising prices. According to the guild's assessment, the spot price of No. 20 medium white sugar was 812,000 yuan, up 230,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half-truck white sugar was 945,000 yuan, Taiwan red sugar was up 30,000 yuan to 815,000 yuan. Shantou Bang Huanggang Qing sugar was 678,000 yuan, and cotton red sugar was 715,000 yuan, with weak transactions of 300 bags. Xinghua white sugar rose 340,000 yuan to 812,000 yuan. Zhuang sugar ranged from 780,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan. High-quality Xing red sugar was 725,000 yuan, and lower quality was 678,000 yuan, totaling over 500 pieces. Hainan red sugar rose 10,000 yuan to 700,000 yuan, totaling over 200 bags. Diao Qing brand sugar was sold in considerable quantities at a lower price, still opening at 645,000 yuan, totaling 3-400 pieces.</p>
<h3>Limited祁门 Black Tea Exports</h3>
<p>祁门 black tea, which was previously exported to Europe, is not being purchased by the UK due to high prices. Currently, Switzerland and other places still favor this variety, but they are offering lower prices, resulting in sporadic sales. Wang Yi Yutai, Wuchang, Xinhua, and other tea companies have recently inquired about this year's Luzhuang Wuyuan bulk tea, but transactions remain low due to the owners' insistence on price. However, the base price is firmer than before. Internal sales of red and green tea remain continuous and active as before.</p>

<h3>Profile of Ho Chi Minh</h3>
<p>— Qiao</p>
<p>Rumors have recently circulated about the arrest and death of Ho Chi Minh, who claims to be the President of Vietnam, but these have not been confirmed. Here is a brief introduction to Ho Chi Minh's life, which should be of interest to readers regarding this momentous figure:</p>
<p>He was born in 1890 in Yi Jing, Vietnam. At the age of seven or eight, he often helped his father deliver secret letters, connecting with revolutionaries in the vicinity. In his youth, he witnessed the anti-French uprisings led by Huang Hua Tan in 1907-08, the poisoning case at the Tokyo French Barracks in 1909, the "March 23" embankment bombing case in 1912, the "April 23" Nguyen Cam Giang's assassination of the Vietnamese Governor-General Sarraut, and Nguyen Van To's Hanoi uprising in 1914, and Zhang Er's uprising. He participated in secret revolutionary movements. Due to intense pursuit by the French, he disguised himself and served on ships, traveling to France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and Japan. He joined the Communist Party in France and later studied in the Soviet Union. Later, he came to China during the Northern Expedition period. Before the purge, he served as the secretary of Borodin. In 1927, he organized the Marxist Vietnamese Overseas Group in Hong Kong, then the Vietnamese Communist Youth League, and eventually founded the Vietnamese Communist Party. After the Pacific War, he could not gain a foothold in Vietnam and went to various provinces in southern China to collude with the Chinese Communists and undermine China's war efforts. He was arrested by the Guangxi authorities in Liuzhou but was soon released on bail. In the spring of 1945, he returned to Vietnam and launched a guerrilla war against Japan. On September 2 of the same year, he declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and a provisional government. King Bao Dai of Annam was forced to abdicate and fled to Hong Kong. In March 1946, he reorganized the provisional government into a coalition government. On October 26 of the same year, he convened the so-called Second People's Assembly, passed the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and appointed himself as the President. On November 3, he reorganized the government and appointed himself as the Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Humor Collection</h3>
<p>— Shao Yin</p>
<p>Two piles of apples were on the ground, one of solid and large apples, the other of green and small apples. "Should the large ones be placed on top and the small ones on the bottom?" The new helper asked the owner while packing the apples into the barrel.</p>
<p>"Of course not," the owner replied. "Honesty is the best policy. Put the small ones on top and the large ones on the bottom!"</p>
<p>The helper obeyed the owner's instructions while secretly laughing at the owner's foolishness.</p>
<p>"Is the barrel full?" the owner asked.</p>
<p>"It's full," the helper replied. "And the barrel lid has been nailed on."</p>
<p>"Good," the owner said. "Now turn the barrel upside down and put on the label!"</p>
<p>In a zoology class, the teacher asked the students, "Children, do you know what humans have that other animals don't?"</p>
<p>After a long pause, a clear, small voice of a girl broke the silence: "It's probably sexual harassment!"</p>
<p>Katie was a brick carrier in the construction project, but he worked very lazily.</p>
<p>"Katie, you lazy bum who only knows how to eat," the supervisor, Merlin, roared, "You should carry twelve bricks at a time, understand? That's a dozen at a time!"</p>
<p>So Katie followed the supervisor's instructions and carried twelve bricks each time, but about twenty minutes later, there were only eleven bricks left. He looked up at the supervisor high above and said, "Hey! Merlin, can you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, what's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Mr. Merlin," Katie said politely, "Right now, I'm one brick short. I don't dare to move according to your words. Or, please throw one to me!" (Translated from Crown Magazine, September issue)</p>

<p>Gold is hard, cold, and icy, most merciless! Gold flashes and shines, a harmful spirit! Please see the gold diggers, why do they lie dead in the wilderness? Gold can buy flesh and soul! Flesh and soul, dreams of life and death are hard to wake up!</p>
<h3>Sexual Activities in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Chai Fei</p>
<p>Those who have traveled to Moscow often find the Soviet Union's handling of general love affairs a bit shameful and avoid talking about them. Lovers in movies are not allowed to kiss affectionately. Even nude plaster statues must be covered with fabric. The gap between men and women in the currently popular social dances is enough to accommodate a third person. If we think that the veil of immorality hides too much of the Soviet regime, then all these measures are not surprising. Later, in order to stabilize family life, there were indeed some changes in the relationship between the sexes. In 1915, three years before the Bolsheviks marched into Moscow, Lenin and his close friend, Inessa Armand, collaborated to clarify the prevalent superficial concepts of free love through spiritual warfare. There should be no problem in liberating the prejudices of money, religion, and class, because the creators of the new regime will certainly praise all kinds of freedom. However, sexual relations that are only superficial should obviously not be supported. Lenin was not interested in mere love and empty friendship. He believed that family responsibilities and obligations must be determined. He felt that traditional habits also had their merits regarding procreation.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union obviously did not follow these instructions later. When I was fifteen years old, a wedding I saw in Moscow was as simple as just registering, taking only three minutes. There were no witnesses, no speeches, and no recitation of legal provisions.</p>
<p>Divorce was even faster than marriage. Just a card stating the wishes of both parties was enough. In the early years of the revolution, abortion was completely legal. The law allowed everyone to freely unite and, conversely, allowed everyone to destroy the new life they conceived.</p>
<p>Many years after the revolution, this situation completely changed. Although the handling of marriage still followed the new traditions after the revolution, it was relatively much more solemn. The halls were usually decorated with lights and ribbons, pastors warmly blessed the happiness of the newlyweds, and speeches were also included in the wedding ceremony. In some cases, the newlyweds also wore white dresses. After the ceremony, guests were usually treated with "vodka."</p>
<p>Divorce also became more difficult. A very serious reason was required for approval. When divorcing by agreement, the date of execution was deliberately extended to give both parties time to reflect. To some extent, making the divorce known to the public was clearly very beneficial for both parties to remarry. Those who proposed a divorce had to spend 500 to 2,000 rubles to obtain the other party's permission. Abortion was considered illegal unless a doctor believed that the fetus would endanger the mother's life.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Soviet Union has been vigorously promoting childbirth and is deeply proud of it. The regime believes that this measure is nothing less than consolidating the foundation of its Soviet organization. A mother who has given birth to ten children is awarded the honorary title of "Heroine Mother," and those who have raised seven, eight, or nine children can also receive the "Medal of Maternal Glory."</p>
<h3>Ginkgo Tree</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese Consul in Los Angeles presented a ginkgo tree, airfreighted from China to the United States, to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to enhance friendship and to express gratitude for the university's establishment of a Chinese Literature Award.</p>
<p>The ginkgo tree is a very common tree in China, but why is it so valued internationally? Let me explain this slowly. The ginkgo tree is a gymnosperm. Although it grew everywhere in the Jurassic period, it is now only found in China. Its scientific name is Ginkyo biloba, which comes from the Japanization of the Chinese word. The original Chinese name is "Duck Foot Tree" because its leaves resemble duck feet. It is also called "Grandson Tree" because the grandfather plants it and the grandson harvests its fruit. The literati of the Song Dynasty were extremely fond of chanting about ginkgo, so the ginkgo tree was valued by the world.</p>
<p>Japan has ginkgo trees because they were moved from China. Therefore, it is called a tree from a different dynasty in the dictionary, or it is said to be a transliteration of "duck foot." Japan probably had the name ginkgo in the Song Dynasty, or perhaps earlier.</p>
<p>It went to Europe and America in 1730 to the Netherlands, 1754 to England, and 1768 to Austria. Ginkgo trees were first seen in the United States in 1795. The German poet Goethe's poem about ginkgo leaves was written in 1815.</p>
<p>From September 8 to 15, 1815, Goethe was in Frauenfeld and gave a ginkgo leaf to Mariane, saying:</p>
<p>"Who knows that originally it was one thing, which divided into two, and united into one?"</p>
<p>This is Goethe's expression of his feelings after meeting Mrs. Mariane, using a ginkgo leaf to express his longing after parting. I remember Tang Ziyou's poem about red leaves: "I once heard that complaints are written on red leaves, who are the letters on the leaves sent to?" So China has a story of expressing intentions with leaves since ancient times. Today, there is still a ginkgo tree standing in the Holzhausen Park in Frankfurt, and there is also a ginkgo tree planted by Goethe's hand in Jena, Germany. It is said that this tree has both male and female characteristics and was used by Goethe as material for studying teratology.</p>
<p>In short, Goethe and ginkgo had an inextricable bond. There is a monument to Goethe in Heidelberg, as well as a commemorative chair. A ginkgo leaf is carved on the chair, and a ginkgo tree is planted next to the chair. The poet is ten times more valued because of the ginkgo, and the poet's feelings are conveyed because of the ginkgo. The fact that a famous Western poet became friends with a famous Eastern tree is truly a good match, which cannot be understood by ordinary people.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, when China presents a ginkgo tree to the University of Los Angeles in the United States, it is not just to express gratitude!</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America's Hero Worship</p>
<p>Americans are a nation with a sense of hero worship. They worship all kinds of strange and bizarre people. The heroes we recognize are mostly figures of military prowess, such as Guan Yu, Yue Fei, Zhuge Liang, and Ming Taizu. The heroes in their minds include all kinds of people, down to vaudeville kings, dance experts, golf experts, wrestlers, and strongmen. Only outstanding people can be welcomed by the public in American society. Mediocre people without special skills cannot easily gain social favor. American society is communal, not solitary. A person who is not welcomed by society cannot live alone in America. Therefore, people who go to America from overseas must have at least one skill, especially in front of multi-talented American women. If you don't have a talent that surpasses hers, you can never win her favor. Your skills are not limited to academic aspects. If you have outstanding achievements in academics, such as writing many books, having scientific inventions, having a talent for rhetoric, or being good at diplomatic language, you can win the favor of Miss America. In addition, if you dance the best, or have a large alcohol capacity, or can tell jokes, or have a very thick face and are not afraid of embarrassment, or are good at manipulating women, they are all heroes worthy of worship in the eyes of Miss America. If you have made special contributions in the War of Resistance, killed several Japanese soldiers, raised a national flag in the occupied area, or forced a landing in the wilderness, then you are a complete, authentic, and unadulterated hero. Not only will many ladies on the street come up to shake hands and say hello, but even kiss you wildly to show admiration, even stepping through the threshold of your house. There will also be a large number of woolen clothes, handkerchiefs, pajamas, and pillowcases sent by unfamiliar ladies, making you flattered and at a loss. There are also ladies who have never met who propose marriage in the first letter. Miss America is so straightforward and innocent. It seems that once she finds her ideal person, she can't wait even one more day and must live together immediately. Going from worshiping a hero to possessing a hero is completely opposite to the reticence and timidity of Chinese ladies. If Miss America worships a hero, she will never consider the hero's background, or even investigate the hero's economic situation. As long as she can achieve the goal of possession, she will wholeheartedly worship everything without question. Heroes have no place to use their talents in China. A hero without an economic background will never receive the worship of Chinese women. Many heroes who have been disarmed beg on the streets, and modern ladies walk by without even lifting an eyelid. If these heroes went to America, they would have been embraced into the boudoir by the ladies, worshiped and worshiped. Therefore, in China, there are only street heroes. When heroes get to the streets, it is like a tiger falling into the plains, treated as a castrated cat.</p>
<h3>Film Scene Weekly</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>Two Worthy British Films</p>
<p>This past week, the two British films "Great Expectations" and "Odd Man Out" are worthy of recommending to audiences who love cinematic art. British films have their unique style. When we are tired of the superficial American films, British films bring you a fresh style. Undoubtedly, their use of realism is correct. We have deeply felt this from past works such as "Brief Encounter" and "This Happy Breed". Similarly, "Great Expectations" has made even more progress.</p>
<p>"Great Expectations" is a famous work by Dickens. Now, David Lean, the leading director in the British film industry, is in charge of directing and adapting it. He handled this famous work precisely and concisely. Especially the harvest of the first half of the play has immortal achievements.</p>
<p>Among the actors, I especially praise the young actor Anthony Wager who played Pip's childhood. He has already created outstanding achievements. John Mills's Pip, Valerie Hobson's Estella, and Finlay Currie's escaped convict Magwitch also have excellent performances. The photography of this film is also worthy of mention.</p>
<p>Another "Odd Man Out" is slightly inferior to "Great Expectations", but it is still an excellent literary film.</p>
<p>"Bathing Beauty" an Entertainment Film</p>
<p>After "Bathing Beauty" was a great hit, this "Easy to Wed" will definitely be liked by the audience as well. Although the script of this play cannot escape the love story, it is not written in a vulgar way. As an entertainment film, then, this play is worth watching.</p>
<p>The female lead, Esther Williams, is a beautiful star on the screen. She is good at swimming, so this play inevitably includes swimming scenes, but there are no brilliant performances. Moreover, she can't act, and she can't handle several scenes that require deeper performances. The male lead Van Johnson's performance is also very mediocre. On the other hand, Laurez Melchior's performance as a male singer is not bad, and there are also several supporting roles that are better than the leading actors.</p>
<p>Detective Film "The Third Day"</p>
<p>This film depicts those special people in American society and can also be regarded as another way of writing detective films. The story still cannot escape the circle of murder and love. So the theme is not new. Although it seems technically stable, the director's mediocre technique is also the fatal flaw of this play.</p>
<p>Dick Powell's performance is still strong.</p>
<p>Not a Wonderful "The Return of Monte Cristo"</p>
<p>A film making a sequel is always worse than the previous one. Because "The Count of Monte Cristo" was once a sensation, this "The Return of Monte Cristo" was produced, that is, the sequel. But the achievement is too far away. Moreover, the audience is already feeling tired of this type of film.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Way to Resolve Hatred</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fei, translator</p>
<p>If "quarreling" requires at least two people, then how many people are needed for "reconciliation"? — This is not a riddle game, but a very important question. If it can be answered appropriately, it can avoid many tragedies in the world.</p>
<p>"Quarrels" are very easy to cause: a hasty word, an accidental action — it comes immediately. Then "self-esteem" joins in, and the real trouble begins. It's not really harmful to have a good, hearty quarrel. It can often be quite beneficial to say what you think in your heart directly. If you have a grudge against someone, it is much better to say it directly than to brew it in your heart and let it worsen your relationship.</p>
<p>The dangerous and harmful thing is the aftermath of the quarrel. That kind of harsh hatred and anger, that kind of intractable determination, can make the person's life so unbearable. So let us answer this question directly and straightforwardly — "reconciliation" only requires one person. If you think that the other party should always make a move first, please think about it calmly again!</p>
<p>Why shouldn't you make a move first? Who exactly are you that you must regard your emotions and self-esteem so important? — Even if the other party doesn't make a move first, it is also foolish.</p>
<p>"Self-esteem" is mostly vanity — based on the false notion of "thinking you're great." So, the next time you are saddened by the aftermath of a quarrel, you should take the trouble to make a move first to end that unpleasant, aggravating situation. Then you will be surprised to find that the other party is willing to run half the way to meet you. Originally, he, like you, had been thinking about how to make a move to reconcile with you as before — or even understand each other better than before!</p>
