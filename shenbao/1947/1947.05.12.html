<h3>魯中國軍兩路追擊　萊蕪北吐絲口收復　淄博等八城正繼續掃蕩</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕收復萊蕪國軍，十一日續沿萊蕪·博山，萊蕪·吐絲口兩公路分路追擊敗退之共軍，下午相繼收復萊蕪東北五公里之孝義集，西北六公里之芹村，蔣家樓。又向萊蕪西南山區掃蕩之國軍，十一日連克距城七公里之徐家峪，向山口等高地，又郿陽亦爲國軍收復。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十一日電〕北上國軍趁勝利餘威，於十一日下午二時收復萊復蕪北要點吐絲口，並繼續向四週掃蕩，至十一日晚，吐絲口東北十華里內已肅淸共軍，且戰且向淄博方面退竄，國軍繼續追擊中。又由棗園寺向東側擊之王耀武部，十一日已抵明水附近，預計兩路國軍即將於吐絲口·明水間正式會師。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南十一日電〕魯中國軍大捷，萊蕪縣城重入國軍掌握後，受創之共軍主力，刻經博山，淄川向張店附近潰竄，其另一部則經吐絲口向祖文鎭（吐絲口北）逃竄，此次萊蕪激戰後，共軍在魯軍事，已漸臨末路。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州十一日電〕沂蒙山區會戰已近結束階段，魯省戰局漸向膠濟中段發　，沂蒙山區西南北全部盡入國軍掌握後，現僅餘東北，東南兩隅之淄川，博山，臨朐，安邱，沂水，莒縣，諸城，日照八城正由國軍繼續掃蕩，由萊蕪向東北潰逃，共軍揚言將再犯膠濟中段之濰縣，並在山東半島之萊陽建立新根據地，國軍刻正乘其喘息未定，啣尾勇猛追殲。</p>
<p>〔又電〕沂水及莒縣十日已在國軍湯恩伯兵團大砲射程之內，沂水以西之坦埠，莒縣西南之夏莊·界湖·艾山·萍塞等處，現均爲國軍佔領。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電」沿沭河右岸向莒縣推進之國軍，十一日已進抵莒縣西南九公里之白地溝·小店。另路國軍向莒縣西南十四公里之大店搜剿，下午一時在夏店附近將共軍兩千餘兜殲殆盡。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州十一日電〕萊蕪·新泰公路上蒙陰寨之國軍，十一日續向四周險峻之山區掃蕩殘餘共軍，蒙陰寨西五公里之桃花峪，七公里之淸泉嶺，高峪及東南三公里之黃山，大小上峪等，悉爲國軍攻克。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十日電〕據某軍事觀察家談：魯共軍雖於國軍後側尙控制四個縱隊，惟其中在沂水之第二，莒縣南大店之第七兩縱隊，被國軍第一兵團殲滅大半，戰鬥力至爲脆弱，至在蒙陰以北之第九縱隊，則已被國軍密切監視，第六縱隊已被包圍於新泰泗水間之大卞橋，不難全部就殲。此外，兗州東南山地共軍魯南軍區張光中部千餘人，則全係游雜民兵，不足爲慮，總計共車此次損失，最低限度當達三分之一以上。最後關於今後魯共動向，其可能去路有三：（一）渡黃河北竄，（二）在膠濟路與國軍再決戰一次，（三）化整爲零，仍潛伏沂蒙山脈，潠擇有利時地，消耗國軍。</p>

<h3>爲減少發行吸收游資　政府將發特特種庫券　期限甚短辦法正在研究中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕當局爲减少發行，吸收游資，短期內將發行特種短期庫劵，詳細辦法正由兪鴻鈞，張嘉　等研究中。聞此種庫劵，可能以一個月至三個月爲期，利息與市塲最高者相同，歸國家銀行負責，而由各地商業銀行辦理兌購手續，購者以票面八折或八折半之現鈔購買，到期時十足兌現。某財政專家十一日向記者分析此種新庫券之優點時，指出普通發行庫券，關鍵在於利息之高下，美金庫券因利息關係，銷行不無影響，他日將發行之特種短期庫券，利息與市塲相同，而國家銀行之信用究較一般爲高，等於比期存款，相信必能吸收大批游資。此種庫劵發行後，至少有下列數種良好影響：（一）减少發行，（二）游資不致羣趨槍購物資，物價平穩，利息即隨之下落。最後渠以樂觀之口吻稱：特種短期庫劵發行後，當局若能更在管制物價穩定幣値方面分頭並進，經濟情勢不難好轉。</p>

<h3>注視日本政局的發展</h3>
<p>日本四月選舉完畢後，卽自五月三日起，正式實施新憲法。明治廿二年頒佈的「大日本帝國憲法」，已結束其五十八年之生命。依照慣例，總選舉後卅日內，現內閣應提出辭職：按之新憲法第六十七·六十八條規定，首相應由國會選舉。現總選後第一屆國會，定期五月廿日召開，裕仁命令吉田，可於廿八日召開國會，因此在這半月期內，是日本政治激盪的時期，一切的演變和發展，均繫於此一階段。截至目前爲止，日本政局的發展，最惹人注意的，一是財相石橋的被整肅，使自由黨受一大打擊：二是社會黨的活躍，希望議會能決定由該黨出任首相：三是自由·社會·民主·國協四黨對於組織舉國一致的內閣，意見已漸趨一致。這些發展，都是決定日本今後政局的新因素，値得我們嚴密的注視。</p>
<p>日本的四月選舉，我們曾判斷保守勢力必獲壓倒的優勢。保守勢力的發展，不僅非日本民主政治之福，抑且爲未來亞洲和平之禍。事實如所預料，日本地方行政長官選舉，保守勢力的勝利，形成旣定之勢，而中央議會地方議會之選舉，亦表現日本的民意，日本的政治，仍積極於保守。參議院議員一百五十名，四月廿日選舉結果：自由黨卅二席，社會黨廿九席，民主黨廿四席，國民協同黨六席，小黨派五席，共產黨一席，無黨無派五十三席。分析言之，保守勢力佔了一百零九席，左派佔了卅席，中間派佔了十一席。衆議院議員四百六十六名，四月廿五日選舉結果：社會黨一百四十三席，自由黨一百卅三席，民主黨一百廿六席，國民協同黨卅一席，小黨派十六席，共產黨四席，無黨無派十三席。分析言之，社會主義者躍居了第一黨，佔下院的首席，吉田首相領導下之自由黨，失去下院最多的議席，幣原領導下之民主黨居第三位，代表保守勢力的政黨，略趨下沉；但自由民主兩黨，同一脈胳，其議席的總合，仍壓倒了社會黨。全國地方議會議員定額爲二四九五名，四月卅日選舉，揭曉了二四八四名，計民主黨五一七名，自由黨四六九名，社會黨四一四名，國民協同黨一三三名，小黨派一七七名，共產黨三名，無黨無派七七一名，如以左派和保守別之，則保守黨派佔一六二二名，左派僅佔五六二名。很顯然的，日本的民意機關，從中央到地方，已爲保守勢力所主宰，未來政治的趨勢，極爲明白。</p>
<p>選舉的總趨勢旣如此，則未來新國會的召開，究由誰來負責組織內閣？抑由社會黨領導，或由三黨四黨組織聯合政府？在國會召開前，可以觀測其趨向：在國會召開後，更可以得到決定。當衆院議員揭曉後，各黨派態度緘默，唯社會黨頻頻開會，發表議論，決定「本黨痛感總選舉後第一大黨所負責任之重大，願傾全力以謀舉國政治體制之實現，」主張未來之內閣，俟吉田於五月六日提出辭呈後，卽由該黨委員長片山哲爲首班，領導組閣運動。該黨內的左派，堅持未來的首相，由片山出任，網羅其他黨派成立聯合政府：該黨內的右派，認識保守勢力的强大，可能於議會中奪回領導地位，甚至吉田可能以「整肅」命令，芟除社會黨的議席，故力主未來之聯合政府，社會黨人不必出任首相，唯要求出長大藏·農林·勞工（尙未成立）經濟安定四部足矣。自由黨的吉田，表示渠決不留戀首相，不過到了六日，延緩了辭職日期，顯然另有作爲。幣原態度「無爲」，而民主黨要員概反對片山出任首相，甚至蘆田均亦認片山任首相不可能。日本人的黨派矛盾是激烈的，然其「忠君愛國」的團結精神，在今天的情况下，他們可以高於一切，所以他們黨派利益的矛盾，可能從對立到統一·觀五月三日實施新憲之日，各黨一致呼籲痛念時艱，要求共同創造新日本，充滿了臥薪嘗膽的精神，面臨懸崖而圖再追再起。從這一點看，我們推斷日本政局的演變，必於短期的激盪，回復於安定。</p>
<p>若干人推斷日本政局，目前的矛盾很多，保守勢力必阻社會黨組閣，我們認此種臆測是錯誤的。且看事實：吉田理應六日辭職，內閣書記長林讓治六日則宣佈延期辭職，社會黨及其他黨派，並不表示異議。廿日爲召開國會期，裕仁忽又命令延期，說明了日本的政黨，日本的政權，在國會召開前，必須要獲得會外的協調，不讓在國會內發生傾軋，發生鬥爭。八日吉田與片山會談，九日四黨領袖便開會，會後立卽發表宣言：「各黨鑑於時局之重大性，均願捐棄成見，實現四黨聯合內閣，期共負打開難局之責。」此一宣言，語重心長！社會黨自由黨民主黨國民協同黨，爲今天日本政界的四大黨，四黨首腦部有了協調，則次期政權之首相，究由片山出任，抑爲吉田聯蟬，或由幣原或由蘆田出任，均爲不重要的問題，而最重要的·是他們能迅速的捐棄成見，競爭於政策的制定，看政策的內容，再決定首選的人選，自由黨持此一見地，社會黨也同樣主張。因此，激盪中的日本政局，現已有寗靜的徵象，由於四黨的協調，何黨出而領導組閣？何人出任首相？均非政局嚴重的問題，故未來的內閣，必能順利組織成功，爲無共產黨的聯合政府，由各黨共同施政，共負國家責任，殆無疑義。</p>
<p>現階段日本政治，可謂爲新的一代之開始。這一頁歷史雖是新的，但人物仍是舊的，胸襟抱負仍是舊的·而且潛伏一種可怕的暗流，大多數的日本人憧憬着勾踐·尤其是一般政治家憧憬着范蠡·這種思想的暗流，今天正滋生在三島，我們對於日本政局應該特別提高警覺。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦未來地位　美蘇代表激烈爭辯　結果提交十五國小組審議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十日電〕聯合國本日至少巳暫時擱置菲列濱·伊拉克。哥倫比亞及印度之折衷建議，幷任命組織新小組委會，以打開巴勒斯坦獨立問題之僵局。當美國反對蘇聯及阿拉伯要求聯合國草擬巴勒斯坦立即獨立之計劃時，此項糾紛即被撥回小組會討論。美代表詹森吿五十五國組成之政委會稱，幷無一國反對巴勒斯坦在適當時間宣吿獨立，但時間問題僅能在調査委會，對巴勒斯坦問題加以澈底硏究後始可決定。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯二次發言，堅持聯合國應立即促使巴勒斯坦之獨立，不應徒作空談。詹森力言美國幷非「不妥協者」，美國願將此事由調査委會決定應否提議巴勒斯坦於目前宣是吿獨立。按調査委會現尙在組織中，將於九月間可提出報吿。政委會於若千折衷建議及修正案提出後，即取消本定於今日下午舉行之會議，而組織另一小組委會。新小組會包括前小組委員十一人，另加伊朗·印度·哥倫比亞及菲列濱之代表四人。十五國小組會於是即舉行秘密會議，定於十一日向政委會提出討論結果。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十日電〕聯合國機構討論巴勒斯坦問題已有兩週，然主要問題即聖地之未來地位，迄猶未獲解決。就各方意見觀，可能之解決辦法有二：一爲使巴勒斯坦分建猶太及阿拉伯兩國，一爲將聖地交聯合國機構託管五年，猶太族內部意見亦未趨一致。據悉，有一部份猶太復國派贊成分治，惟以猶阿兩國所得土地應行相等爲條件，另有一派則認接受分治以後，即無法挽回，故反對迅速接受分治之議，不如先交中聯合國託管。美國猶太復國會長薛爾佛亦認在未有足量猶人之移入，以取得居民之多數以前，不宜建立猶太國。目前聖地猶人僅約六十萬名，而阿拉伯人則在百萬以上，至於阿拉伯國則要求立即獨立，以保持多數優勢。</p>
<h3>聯大開會聲中　突發表文件　證明赫賽尼與德通謀</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十二日電〕此間今日發表影印檔案多件，證明耶路撒冷回敎主赫賽尼與軸心國通謀之經過情形。其中並有赫賽尼致德國政治警察領袖希姆萊之函件，內容係關於二人協力消减猶太人之計劃。同時在日義大使館及赫賽尼之私人文件中所搜獲之納粹文件，亦皆透露阿拉伯領袖曾自摩浴哥至印度尼西亞等地，向回敎人民傳佈軸心國之宣傳，並擬組織阿拉伯軍隊，協助納粹軍作戰。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷十一日電〕巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級執委會副主席赫賽尼，定今日飛開羅晤該會主席耶路撒冷回敎主赫賽尼，所談當與聯大會之發展有關。一說副主席赫賽尼將親自前往紐約參加聯合國之會議。</p>
<h3>和平時期改得租借法　美國推行新計劃　使歐亞民主國家能經濟自立</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕美政府現正企圖將「杜魯門主義」之重心，由反共十字軍之理論，轉變爲重建西歐及遠東民主之經濟措施。官方認爲「杜魯門主義」乃美國之世界政策，彼等將使此項計劃成爲和平時期之租借法案措施。杜魯門目前引以爲憂者，乃如何使西歐及遠東不致經濟崩潰。高級官方深信減少西歐及遠東共黨勢力之最重要方法，即爲使該處各國經濟上可以自立。國務副卿艾克遜最近在克里夫蘭發表演說，要求立即復興德日兩國之經濟，要求採取若干經濟措置，諸如延長戰時管制出口法等，此項演說即爲開始此項轉變運動之先聲。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅盛頓十日電〕素被目爲反映國務院意見之華盛頓郵報記者李浦曼，預料美國政府於今後十二個月內，將不得不恢復某種形式之租借制度。李氏稱，歐洲之生活水準，可能全面崩潰，在今後數月內，總之不出十二個月，美國當不得不恢復某種方式之租借制度，每年所需經費至少當在五十億元，而此項租借援助，不免須賡續數年之久。李浦曼認美國務副卿艾克遜兩日前在克里夫蘭發表之演說，爲將此項計劃宣布於美國民衆前之第一步。艾氏之言證實此間負責人之預料世界即將普遍短缺美元之信念，負責人士且信除非實行較援助希土以及朝鮮計劃更廣大之對外援助計劃，則許多國家均不免因缺乏美元而感覺空前之匱乏。據悉，目前缺乏美元之國，不但有英法等國，即如瑞典墨西哥等素被目爲繁榮之國，亦已面臨同一危機。目前許多國家均已傾囊以購貨物，而美國最近在一星期內，聯邦黄金存底復增達一億五千萬元，故衹有美國能予他國以援助。</p>
<h3>杜魯門主義　與胡佛建議不謀而合</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕據今日消息：前總統胡佛，約在廿八年前，當其在救濟歐洲總監任內，曾建議與「杜魯門主義」極相類似之計劃。胡佛曾建議美國畫一切可能力量，援助歐洲渡過戰後經濟困難，但渠提出下列條件：即美國「必須堅持任何無決心使其國內財政與政治形勢趨於穩定之國家，不能予以援助」。此一建議之發現，乃由於美國務院公佈其關於一九一九年巴黎和會之第十册公報所致。</p>
<h3>希外長稱頌　美援希計劃</h3>
<p>大赦辦法正與美折衝</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十日電〕關於美國援助希臘，頃由希臘外長蔡爾達　斯加以評論稱，吾人若稱之爲「救濟」或「援助」實不適當，事實上此乃租借法之延長，其目的乃在欲使民主原則在聯合國之間，尤其是在戰時損失慘重之各國間，獲得勝利。希臘現已成爲一極重要之機塲，僅此點即足以使美國之關切希臘成爲合理。此外尙存在一種戰略問題，上次大戰已證明防禦局勢之不足恃，但希臘必能成爲一直入中東心鐵之有力前驅云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社雅典十一日電〕希臘政府「在大體上」，同意美國國際監督大赦之建談，以便吸引估計約有一萬五千之山中遊擊隊來歸。但在致美國駐希大使麥克費照會中曾提出一項條件，即巴爾幹調査調團所建議之聯合國監督大赦辦法，必須取消。麥氏要求美國將其建議加以闡明其僅爲一「純粹大赦」。預料美國之覆文將下週初提出。據聞美國建議雖僅爲一種提議性質，但內中却含有要挾在內，美國將對希終止援助，以支持美國之建議云。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫接受美條件　美援韓決心不變　如全韓統一則援助將擴至全境</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫接受美國重開朝鮮境蘇美共同委員會之條件，雖美國官員表示歡迎，但認爲並非全然出乎預料之外者。渠等認爲蘇聯同意美國條件開會，乃爲美國對朝鮮問題強硬態度之最後結果。惟有一項疑問者，即此究何時實現是也。據美方假定，蘇聯之願意出此，將以渠等之北方佔領區事態爲條件。惟莫洛托夫之接受美國條件，並不足改變美國予朝鮮大量經濟援助之決心。此項援助，如實行時朝鮮業已統一，則將擴至全境。莫洛托夫不允根據馬歇爾五月二日函中所提建議，對朝鮮所有各政治團體，皆予以自由表示意見機曾，而對美國歷來所允許之最寬大條件，加以接受，被人視爲實爲其精明之選擇。</p>
<h3>麥帥總總發表　佔領南韓報告</h3>
<p>美正全力促成韓獨立</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕麥帥今日發表美軍佔領朝鮮南部二月份報吿稱，該處美軍當局已使更多之朝鮮人擔任政府要職，以備該國他日完全自主。朝鮮人方面反對托管甚爲堅强，切望早日獨立，美軍司令霍奇對之甚表同情，聲明美國正全力促成其事。美軍當局曾一再表示，竭力使朝鮮人能自由主持其政府各部門。美軍政府曾與朝鮮澈底討論農林·財政·工商業·政府改組及選舉法等問題。朝鮮南部生產已大見進步。</p>

<h3>日政局暗潮潛伏　保守派力爭力動　新閣政策將引起爭執</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十一日電〕民主黨幣原一派，認爲各黨保守份子之共同戰綫倘馬可能，則民主黨應出任首相。該黨之新派方面，亦認爲首相問題與閣僚分配比率問題，不應分別決定。以此十二日之四黨幹事長會議，結果將爲保守分子掌握主動權，一俟社會黨提出包括閣僚分配比率等之收拾政局方案後，再行決定態度。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十一日電〕關於社會黨組閣問題，雖在九日四黨代表會談中，已一致贊成祖織聯合內閣，但基本籢結似仍存於保守勢力與社會主義勢力之爭，亦即今後日本政治趨左趨右之爭。四黨幹事長會談，雖已定於十二日舉行，然此類基本問題，決非三數度會談所能決定，目前對於政策，首相人選，及閣僚比率等問題，各政黨大多仍採保留態度。如對於政策，自由黨仍將以本來政策爲基礎。又國民協同黨仍堅持：（一）基於農村經濟民主化，主張製訂農業協同組合法；（二）新圓問題，應在四黨會議中法定對策；（三）反對重要企業圖有國營；（四）對勞動者設立小學制度。</p>
<p>〔路透社主力艦先鋒號上十日電〕伊麗莎伯公主及瑪格麗公主今日參觀本艦機械室及掌舵室，兩人曾親自掌舵，伊麗莎伯公主奉命將艦駛向左轉二十五度，公主即遵照方向指示盤，轉動舵盤，不稍錯悞，後易瑪格麗公主接掌，又奉命將艦右轉二十五度，公主即視表轉舵，使本艦恢復原行方向。</p>
<h3>英債臺高築　貝文信心彌堅</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十日電〕英外相貝文本日在其璜特斯衛斯選區發表演說稱當余自莫斯科返國道經柏林時，見該城在大戰結束二年之後，仍是一片廢墟，因此余認爲不因勝利而昂然自得，反而感覺造成大戰之人民，其後果至爲悲慘。余內心切望能保存所有剩餘之事物與人類之精萃，以期戰爭免於再度爆發，吾人現已將吾人所有典質殆盡，出售一空，以致赤貧如洗，吾人現有內債二千五百萬鎊，及外債將近三十萬萬鎊，但吾人並不因此失望，反感覺吾人在世界上仍應爲偉大之領袖，在道德上領導世界，俾對於人類之進步，有所貢獻云。</p>
<h3>英內閣將開會議　通盤檢計印局勢　印督定期宣布還政計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕印督蒙巴頓勳爵之專使伊斯美勳爵，定星期三或四啓程返新德里，英內閣於週一或週二當舉行印度局勢之通盤討論，俾伊斯美勳爵得將英內閣對於印督所呈報吿書之反響，呈覆蒙巴頓。</p>
<p>〔路透社西姆拉十日電〕此間今日宣布：印督蒙巴頓勳爵定本月十七日在新德里將移交印度政權之計劃，吿知印度領袖。文吿有謂，印督已邀國大黨，回敎同盟及錫克之代表，於五月十七日晨在新德里與其會晤，向彼等提出英政府移交印度政權之計劃。被邀與印督會晤之印度領袖，有印度臨時政府副總統尼赫魯，回盟會長眞納，錫克領袖印度臨時政府國防部長辛格。印督此外並邀參與談判土邦參加制憲議會問題之印度土邦代表，於五月十七日下午與其會晤。</p>
<h3>回盟考慮　改變態度</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十一日電〕頃悉回敎同盟已允重行考慮其一九四六年七月所作直接行動之決定，此一行動結果，乃有本月十七日印政界領袖與印督蒙巴頓間圓桌會議之召集，將研究英政府以權力讓予印度人問題。</p>
<h3>出巡南非三月　英王回朝</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕英王等一行遊歷南菲凡三閱月，明日可望返抵本國，接受盛大歡迎。英國最新式戰鬥艦「先鋒」號將於明日駛入樸資茅斯港，但國王王后及二公主因等待正式回朝典禮，在十二日上午八時以前不致登陸。樸資茅斯遊客　集，屆時海灘擁擠情形自在意中。明晚格勞斯特公爵與王室在艦上同進餐。十二日晨十時，鹵簿將通過樸資茅斯，由英王親自檢閱儀仗隊，改乘火車來京。惠靈吞公爵，艾德里首相，以及其他政府要員，均將恭候駕臨，然後馳赴白金漢宮。</p>
<h3>英暹換文　未涉土地問題</h3>
<p>前暹總理抵華府接洽</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕此間權威方面稱，英國與暹羅在盤谷換文，僅涉暹境敵產及由暹交還盟國財產問題，並無土地問題之牽涉。交換之照會，實際上爲補充一九四六年一月一日英暹所訂之和平協定，該和平協定規定由暹羅宣布於一九四一年十二月七日以後暹羅取自英國之土地，一槪無效。最近換文之內客，包括：（一）暹羅應將其國境內之日本財產及其他敵產交盟國處置；（二）暹羅應交還與暹宣戰諸國在暹之財產權利及權益；（三）暹羅應提供適當貨幣，作爲暹境英軍之維持費。</p>

<h3>法越試探和平　漸入具體階段</h3>
<p>〔透社西貢十日電〕法方與越盟間之和平試探工作，於三星期以前以來，即在此間及越南境外進行，預料越督波拉特於週三抵河內後，此項和平試探工作，將益趨具體化。可靠方面謂：具有越盟政府和平意見之函一件，已遞交現在河內之波拉特個人代表慕斯。波氏抵河內後，將有三日之勾留，屆時將發表公開演說，其內容當與越南政局有重大關係。波氏定五月二十六日離越返巴黎，六月中旬始能返越，越局之最後解決辦法，須俟波氏自法返越後始能成立。</p>
<p>越盟新黨頗形活躍</p>
<p>同時值茲初步談判漸趨緊張之際，越方若干小黨已團結組成一新黨，名日「全越盟國民陣綫」，以便與法當局談判。該黨於今日發表宣言，自稱前安南王保大乃該新黨之領袖，並曰彼等已與官方居間人取得接觸。該黨宗旨，與胡志明領導之黨相同，即使越盟在法國聯邦內統一並獨立，但該新黨斥胡志明政府爲共產及極權的政權，故表示反對。</p>
<h3>馬島革新運動　法閣決予解散</h3>

<h3>納粹侵略史披露　赫斯飛英內幕　曾勸誘英國接受和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕美陸軍部編製共八册之巨的納拌侵略史，於今日出版，其中對希特勒之副元首赫斯飛英之內幕，有詳細之透露。赫斯抵英後，曾向漢密爾頓公爵建議保證英帝國之屬地，以交換英國之承認德國對歐洲之控制。赫斯並表示，德國對於美洲並無野心，所謂德意志的威脅，不過爲一種幻想，希特勒之利益僅以歐洲爲限。赫斯又曰，若英國接受和平，美國必將在怒，蓋美國之眞正用意，在繼承不列顚帝國耳。赫斯建議英國可在其帝國範圍內，有完全之自由行動權，惟德國以前之殖民地則應交還德國。漢密爾頓公爵並謂，渠與赫斯談德國之和平建議時，曾談及愛爾蘭問題。赫斯表示渠與希特勒談話時，從未提及愛爾蘭問題，愛爾蘭在此次戰爭中，與德國無關，故料希特勒當不致顧及英愛關係。納粹侵略史復透露，納椊空軍早在一九三九年甚至一九三八年，可能已曾在高空偵察倫敦區之形勢。</p>

<p>其次中央及地方政府對物價高漲及人民生活問題，決盡力想法解決。工人生活指數，在昨日物價會議中，業已決定解凍調整辦法，規定底薪在三十元以下者，依照指數發給，三十元以上者，逐級打折扣。此項決定，母須經行政院通過，於本月份起，工人待遇，即可按照此項辦法實行。目前上海一般工人之底薪，較之戰前高得多，設若全部底薪照指數發給，則工廠將不勝負祖，而將陷整個工業於總崩潰之境。政府一方面爲保障工人之生活，一方面顧全工廠之負担，乃決定此項辦法。否則工廠因不勝負担而被迫關門，工人隨之全部失業，則問題更將嚴重矣。故今日高喊無條件解凍生活指數者，實非工人之友，而爲工人之敵。如另有背景欲藉工資問題造成上海之不安定，則實爲我全上海市民之敵。吾人應知當前之經濟危機，極爲嚴重，勞資雙方以及各方面必須相瓦犧牲，相互讓步，以渡此難關。再次關于米的問題，政府當局煞費考慮”一方面要求米價低，使社會生活不受影響，一方面又恐米價過低，造成「穀賤傷農」的惡果。自米潮發生後，市府截至目前爲止，已拋出食米十七萬包，因配價之價格太低，致有米店十二家，因市民擁擠爭購而發生事故。其中情節重大者，僅有五六家，上海共有米店二千餘家，今在米潮中發生事故者，尙不到百分之一，似尙不能認爲過分嚴重。政府茲爲避免各米店配售擁擠起見、已決定改善配售辦法，各工廠工人，公敎人員及各學校住讀學生，均由市府直接配給食米。貧民方面，由政府設立配售店，計口配售。社會局吳局長今仍留南京，與有關當局，繼續商討配售食米之詳細辦法，預計今日（即十一日）夜車可返滬。此項辦法，本市於下週內，即可實施。</p>
<p>最後，須鄭重申述者，政府有維持社會秩序安寗之決心，厲行法治，自今日起，有對正當糧商之營業乘幾搗亂者，決予嚴辦。米商打人，亦必以法律嚴格制裁。至米市塲除北市塲昨已復業外，南市塲方面，明晨本人將召集負責人談話，並派軍警保護，明日（十二日）復業，亦可無問題。</p>
<p>董顯光在記者招待會上致詞（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>董顯光招待新聞界　希望協助政府安定人心　報界如有困難允予助力</h3>
<p>行政院新聞局局長董顯光，副局長鄧友德，前晚先後自京抵滬，昨午假國際飯店首次招待本市新聞界。吳市長。潘議長均應邀參加，共到六十餘人。董氏於席間致辭稱；本人尙未正式就任新聞局長之職，新聞局亦未正式成立，新聞局之任務，現皆在本人及兩位副局長之肩上。今以米潮之發生，及其他各項情形之嚴重，乃亟欲來滬與各位見面。今日得此機會，與各位同業及老友相晤一堂，非常愉快，今後請各位對政府之行政設施，尤其在安定人心方面，多多予以協助。在憲政實施前，報紙之力量極大，人民仰賴輿論之領導者亦極多，値此人心浮動時期，深望各位於撰寫新聞評論及製作標題時，力求審愼，避免刺激，則人民之心理，即可比較趨於安定。試舉一例，如食米問題，因人心不安，致有米者不願出賣，無米者紛紛爭購貯藏。在如此情形下，無論有多少米，亦將永遠不會足够。類是情形，均須新聞界協助以安定人心者。中央及地方政府，現正抱定決心，對與人民有切膚關係之各項問題，陸續謀求解決，請輿論界多多予以助力，並希望各位對新聞局多多指敎，如新聞界有困難之處，本人亦當竭盡全力，協助解決，請各位亦以同樣之心力，協助新聞局。</p>
<p>縱由吳市長發表赴京請示處置本市物價及安定社會秩序之辦法（見前）後由新聞界人士，相繼發表意見，並由董局長吳市長分別予以答復。</p>
<p>議長發表　意見四點</p>
<p>潘議長公展，向政府當局貢獻安定社會秩序之意見四點：（一）目前上海不講法而講武力之現象，如長此放任下去，則上海無前途，整個國家無前途，而陷入不可收拾之地步。市長旣有安定社曾之決心，應立即在中央指示之方針下會同警備部，制止一切不合法之行動，依法處置，此項措置，一定爲全市市民所擁護。最近時因羣衆之遊行請願，致妨害公共交通及社會秩序，實屬不當。蓋任何事情，應講是非，今則不講是非，而唯以人數之多少來比力量，如是社會之秩序，如何能安定？故此點必須糾正。（二）政府一切措施，應從大處着想，不應再加不安定之因素。中央訂定法令前，必須先與地方當局愼重商討，以免實行時發生困難。（三）物價希望不再高上去，並希望中央立即決定平定物價之辦法，然在辦法未決定以前，請中央要員千萬少發表談話。因上海爲　一投機市塲，中央要員之一言一語，皆足以被投機商人利用或曲解，作爲抬價及刺激市塲之好資料。物價會議所決定之指數辦法，極爲合理，但必須政府强有力的執行，及各界人士一致擁護，與政府充分合作，始能順利推行。最後潘氏請吳市長注意「貧民」配米問題，應與社會局特別愼重考慮，所謂「貧民」之範圍，以免因標準不一，而發生紛擾。</p>
<p>程滄波繼起發言，要求政府主管當局，在謀求社會安定以前，安定新聞界本身。新民報鄧季惺，聯合晚報王紀華，對程氏之呼　，表示同情。</p>
<p>技術困難　應予體諒</p>
<p>胡健中發言，原則接受董局長所述力避刋載有刺激因素之消息，但請體諒新聞工作者，在技術上處理新聞之困難情形，難免不有過重或過輕之處，惟技術上縱有處置失當，動機則實純正無他，應予體諒。最後曹谷冰，李子寬，章倉萍等分別發表意見。曹谷冰對董局長願協助新聞界解決困難一點，表示衷誠感謝。李子寬請主管當局注意解決報紙供應問題。</p>
<h3>配屋拒絕訂約　市長負責交涉</h3>
<p>章蒼萍以公敎人員分配房屋，規定統租期限，業已屆滿，行政院雖明令規定現有住戶得與業主洽訂租約，繼續居住，惟各業主及經租賬房爲貪圖頂租房屋厚利，多不願與現有住戶繼續訂約，而企圖收回房屋，另行頂租，果瀾，本市居住分配　　之數萬公敎人員，勢將流結失所，實爲社會上一嚴重問題，要求吳市長在「安定社會秩序」之原則下，予以妥善解決。吳市長表示，日前已邀集各房產業主談話，希望與現有住戶洽訂租約，各業主多表首肯，僅對房租方面，希望酌量調整。現居分配房屋之住戶，如向萊主洽訂租約，而被拒絕，可報吿本人，當負責代爲交涉云云。招待會至二時許始散。</p>

<h3>收回跑馬廠　一市民建議參會　發行有獎證券　加息償還本金</h3>
<p>本市參議會第三次大會，本月　內即行召開，跑馬廳收回問題，又將熱烈討論。該會頃據市民冷淸建議收購本市跑馬廳產權辦法略稱：宜仿照戰前航空獎券方式，發行收購上海跑馬廳產權有獎證劵一種，即以其收入儲存作收購之需，於實施之初，應由有關當局邀同跑馬總會，體育總會，地方公正人士，曁地籍專家等就跑馬應現有土地面積，及其地上建築物，精密商榷，求一公允正確估計數額以爲依據，然此劵其性質應與航空獎券辦法有別，採行加息還本方策，屆滿若千年後，得按照一般銀行存款利率加息還本，如是則中獎者固屬慶幸，未中者亦不失其投資上之保障。爲求合理起見，應由市政當局與地方工商界人士，共同組織收購跑馬廳產權有獎證劵資金保管委員會，負責保管，另並建議具體方法六點提請大會公決。</p>

<h3>我商船設備太差　駕駛員不能緘默　希望政府改善免致騰笑友邦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國商船駕駛員總會，昨午四時招待記者，由該會理事長金月石報吿，略謂因我國商船設備太差，失事之機會較多，而失事後犧牲者亦慘重，一般人不明眞相，每多指摘駕駛人員不盡責任，不知我國商船上設備均不够標準，如熊載三百人之船上，僅有可供一百人用之救生設備，遇險時如何能不爭先恐後，演成慘劇。又如現在載客船隻，多係貨船改裝而成。我國於一九二二年已爲國際海上生命安全公約簽字國之一，最近英國邀請我國參加修改海上生命安全國際會議，如再不力謀改善，豈不貽笑友邦，且亦視人命爲兒戲。吾人籲淸（一）立法院應從速制定輪船載客法規，（二）監察院對規定不合標準之航政機構應提出彈劾，（三）請政府明白規定，今後乘客，在遇險時，究竟何人有享受分得救生衣及先上救生艇的權利。（四）政府應明白規定本國救生衣艇的最高標準，及其詳細款月，（五）每次開船，航政機構應派員會同船長檢查客貨實在狀况。最後吾人應向社會聲明，凡因救生救火等設備不合標準而引起之任何結果，船員不能負資等語。並散發英國船舶救生設備標準一紙，作爲我國將來訂定標準時之參考。</p>

<h3>爲了一碗肉　發生凶殺案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕回敎徒山東人楊成山，廿五歲，與昔年同校求學之好友許交新，合資在北四川路多倫路口一九〇三號開設協盛文具店，兩人均宿店中。某日進膳時，菜中適有猪肉一味，許勸楊不必遵敎規，儘可吃肉。因此細故，兩人竟致感情破裂，旋楊拆股離去，寄住蘭路一倉庫中，許自楊去，亦頗後悔，無意單獨經營，即將店讓盤與其兄許成壽主持後，離滬赴福建某銀行任事。昨日下午四時許，楊行經該店，見營業殊佳，大受刺激，逕赴該店對面牛肉攤上，搶得一利刀，闖入文具店，將許成壽頭臂臀部連砍五刀，受傷甚重，隔壁泰利西服店主林國定聞聲趕至，立將兇手抱住，奪下利刀，同時崗警亦至。即將傷人送入醫院，兇手帶局。訊悉以上情形，押候解送地檢處究辦。</p>
<h3>行政法院獨立機構　仍以維持原制爲宜　馬君碩闡述理由五點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕憲法實施，新司法院租　法制定後，行政裁判機關應否變更，亦即行政法院制應否取消之問題，各界意見紛歧，記者昨與本市名律師馬君碩氏談及，渠認爲不必取消，仍以維持原制爲宜，其理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）行政訴訟爲人民與官署間之訴訟，係以制裁官署之違法處分爲目的。全國官署，下自地方官署，上至中央五院，皆得爲行政訴訟之被吿，自應有相當規模之獨立機關專司其事。我國自民元迄今，向有行政裁判機關，若於憲法實施後，反予撤銷而與普通司法機關合併，成爲司法院之一庭，殊失原來之獨立超然地位。（二）美國行政法與普通法並無區別，故最高法院兼理行政訴訟事件，但我國制度，行政訴訟與民刑訴訟，截然有別，且在提起行政訴訟前，須經過行政上之訴願再訴願程序，不得向地方或高等法院起訴，故若將行政法院與普通司法之最高級合併，則形成上合下分，使系統紊亂，專權混推。（三）目前行政法院採一級一審制，普通司法機關則採三級三審制，若予合併，在組織上更難謂爲適當。（四）現行行政法院組織法，規定行政法院分設二庭或三庭，每庭置評事五人，迨至憲政時期，行政訴訟案件必漸增多，組織上尙有擴充之需要，若反予撤鎖，而僅以司法院之一庭應付全國人民之行政訴訟案件，事實上恐不可能。（五）裁判行政訴訟事件，必須對於行政組織及行政實施情形具有充分了解，同時行政法並無法典可資援引，現行行政法規又不足以解決一切行政爭端，如以普通司法官兼任行政裁判職務，在能力方面亦不無問題，綜上所述，仍以維持行政法院之獨立機構爲宜也云云。</p>

<h3>飛行與天氣　氣象學家黃厦千　昨應邀廣播演講</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座元昌鶴鳴電台舉辦第六次星期日特別廣播，請國防部國防科學委員會委員兼國立中央大學氣象學系主任黄廈千博士（見圖），播講「飛行與天氣」。茲節錄其演詞如下：</p>
<p>去年聖誕節那天，上海有三架飛機跌毁，接後又有幾架飛機失事，損失均甚重大。即在去年春初，亦有幾架跌毀，航空界的不幸事件，顯然多在冬季。這幾時大家都很安慰，航空可稱太平無事。而且不但現時太平，我可預吿，還有幾時可請大家放心乘坐飛機。那末在冬季航空界就何以如此多事呢？找可明白吿訴諸位，這不是迷信者所謂「天數」或「氣運」，而是由於「天氣」。有了這些敎訓，就該注意天氣與飛行的關係。</p>
<p>一年中天氣，總括說起來，以冬季爲最壞。航空界的不幸事件所以發生在冬季爲最多，就是這個緣故。冬季天氣爲飛行之害者，有下列數項：（一）是天氣陰雨，雲層甚低，有時雲底與山頭相連，飛機飛出雲層就撞在山頭上。去歲戴竺將軍的遇難便是這個原故。而有時雲底幾與地面相連，氣象上稱之爲「天頂爲零」，飛機在空中見不到跑道，無法降落，待汽油用完，惟有跌毀。去年聖誕節在本市失事的三架飛機，原因在此。（二）是地面有霧。上邊雖是晴天，但地面爲霧所籠罩，飛機在天空中無法覓得機塲與跑道，不是油盡跌落，就是與機塲附近的山或其他障碍物相撞而跌毁。今年一月靑島附近一架之跌毀即由於此。（三）是雲層中溫度太低，飛機經過其中，機翼結冰。失云操縱控制，自然不能再向前飛行而跌毀了。今年二月在重慶南岸失事的空運機，就爲這個緣故。</p>
<p>以上低雲，霧及凍雲，均以冬季爲最，冬季航空界之多不幸事件，也就成爲自然的結果了。今後天氣晴明和暖，所以我判斷此類事件將减少，可稱爲大家乘坐一飛機的好時期。但到了夏季，又有雷陣，亦常能引致飛機失事，飛機駕駛員及乘客均要小心。好在現時關於各地天氣情况以及未來天氣情况，有氣象合測候預吿。航空公司當局宜多舉辦氣象事業，乘客應査査航空公司有無氣象情報。果能大家都從天氣方面注意，那末航空的不幸事件就可减少了。</p>
<p>播講會唱　節目繁多</p>
<p>本報主辦第六次星期廣播，昨假元昌鶴鳴電台舉行。上午鍾志和醫師主講「肺癆病最新療治法」，祭忠賢司譯主講「關於路德聖母的故事」。下午張榮江宗敎講座，宓錫通律師主講「兵役及國民應畫之義務」。馮秋萍女士主講「羢綫編結法」，唐仁續博士主講一關於飮食問題」。晚七時四十分至十時四十分爲各名票之平劇會串，計有王紹庭。許紫雲之「釣金龜」，趙翔雲之「轅門射戟」，張哲生。王玉田之「父子會」，范石人，王王讓之「鬧府」，及趙榮琛之「鎖麟囊」，（由梅允華操琴）夏邁羣之「賣馬」，譚雪萊之「汾河灣」，張師翰之「逍遙津」，蕭澤霖之「失街亭」，何時希之「羅成托兆」（小顯），朱聖淸之一洪羊洞」「定軍山」，朱敏之六月雪」，由沙紹春·李宗林操琴樊棣生打鼓，富雪亮月琴。十一時至十二時，並有股震賢·朱堯文·沈琢如·葉小泓。周幕軒及柳　圖之崑曲。</p>

<h3>交大學生二千餘人　定今日晉京請願　將向教部提出八項要求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國立交通大學學生自治會，昨日下午，在該校恭綽館，招待新聞界，報吿此次因反對敎部決定停辦交大航海輪機兩科而罷課睛願之理由及目的，籲請社會予以同情。據稱：敎部歧視交大，不一而足，例如：（一）去年北平交大鐵道管理學院及唐山分院，同被勒令與交大分離獨立。（二）交大學生有三千餘人，敎授職工僅四百餘人，而共有學生五千餘人之中央大學，敎職員人數達一千三百餘人。（三）交大每月經費僅一千萬元，而開支達五千萬，加上敎授職工薪水名額的不足，每月須虧空七千萬元，以前均由復員費中動用，但復員費十數億元亦已用罄，國內其他大學如浙大曾得額外補助費五十億元，中大曾得敎職員寒衣費二十億元，其他國立大學經費亦比交大爲多。（四）敎部非但不准交大續辦輪機航海兩科，他如紡織水利兩系，亦不准設立，化工系是否可以續辦，亦尙在攷盧中，而對於其他大學却令擴充，例如復且添設漁撈專修科，同濟增設法學院等。交大同學爲愛護交大，不忍交大被摧殘，曾幾次上書請願，派代表晋京，終吿無效，因此以行動來抗議，決定向敎部提出八項要求：（一）交通大學應名符其實，成爲交通大學，交大各院及系科不容分割，交大袋展不容限制。（二）航海輪機不容停辦。（三）水利，紡織，化工，必須繼績設立。（四）交大不容受歧視。（五）要求增加交大經費。（六）要求增加交大設備友校舍。（七）要求補足交大敎授及員工名額。（八）要求增加交大公費及名額。該校護校委員會，並對敎部發言人方志懋前日所發表之談話，嚴加更正，及對吳校長之書面談話，加以補充如下：（一）敎部所稱航海輪機兩科，原屬重慶船校，復員後應歸原校辦理．同學認爲人才需要孔亟，兩校同時訓練尙恐不足，豈可反加削减。（二）朱部長及周司長確曾表示，擬將交大專業化，改爲工程學校，凡非工程性質之院系將攷慮調整，同學認爲交大一校專業化，而他校擴充，實非合理化。（三）朱部長確曾表示交通大學爲隸屬交通部時之名稱，目下已不妥當。敎部發言人所稱「絕無其事」，實屬自食其言云。又訊：交大學生二千餘人，定今日（十二日）晋京請願，展開護校運動，據聲稱不達目的，決不罷休。</p>

<p>勢均力敵</p>
<p>港軍侯榕生，沙利文，蕭惠爾，及却利未出塲，由希拜特，卡凡羅等補缺，滬華聯嚴士鑫，鐔福楨，韓龍海誤卯·由張林根·孟義良，高秀淸等參職，雙方陣綫，各有千秋，滬方實力銳减，因此形勢益見平均，九十分鐘，互有攻守，成游擊活動戰狀態。一如前日，緊張而不精彩，均非理想陣容也。雙方列陣如下：</p>
<p>港埠際</p>
<p>格拉克斯　謝錦洪　希拜特　馮坤勝　張金海上　鄒文治下　劉松生　何應芬　黎兆榮　卡凡羅　鄒文治上　張金海下　謝錦河</p>
<p>滬華聯</p>
<p>張邦綸　張林根　吳祺祥　韓龍波　孟義良　高保正　李垚　孫錦順　高秀淸　羅壽福　賈幼良</p>
<p>中圈盤旋</p>
<p>裁判員吳守衡，巡邊員樂秀榮黄仁彝，登塲執法，華聯隊遲到，比賽至四時四十分開始，客軍開球，中圈往返，均無建樹。至五分鐘時，羅壽福右角高弔，高秀淸猛衝前進，港門將格拉克斯，躍起接球，遂與小高互撞，同時倒地受傷，球賽一度停頓。十九分鐘時，李垚邊綫切中，小羅漏空，高秀淸及時趕上，謝錦洪救球心切，又與小高互撞，格拉克斯急將來球撲出，謝錦洪受傷離塲後，客軍以十人應戰。華聯乘機來襲，惜未見功。</p>
<p>各一平手</p>
<p>至卅二分鐘後，謝錦洪負傷再入，（左手食指脫骱）卡凡羅於卅碼外射門，中横木彈出。二分鐘後，李垚盤過希拜特，高弔門前，賈幼良冷路竄出，迎頭一頂，竟吿中的，一比〇華聯首開紀錄。港隊自失首城後，大舉反攻，幸吳祺祥張邦綸等搶救得法，至卅八分鐘時，馮坤勝脚踝傷筋離塲，客軍再以十人作戰，孫錦順窺得空擋射門，亦中横木彈出，距前半終塲一分鐘，客軍否極泰來，劉松生於廿五碼處遠射，張邦綸大意，遂被攻陷，一比一上半時未分勝負。</p>
<p>再傳捷報</p>
<p>休息過後，再行交鋒，港軍馮坤勝傷愈入塲，何應芬與謝錦河互易位置，接觸後，港隊傾師來犯，鄒文治單騎刦營，惜乎射來稍歪，不獲而返。四分鐘時華聯亦圖偸襲，李垚與幼良利用兩翼包抄，幼良於十碼左右射門，適中格拉斯克懷抱。至十八分鐘時，李垚於底角勾球送出後，爲張金海踏傷離塲，未一分鐘，希拜特於禁區白綫外，以手吻球，由孫錦順操刀，幼良故意遮住門將視綫，鐵腿起處，球自右上角飛入網內，淸晰可觀，二</p>
<p>三度和局</p>
<p>廿一分鐘時，張金海與鄒文治互易位置後，金海冷門竄出。於華聯門外廿碼處力射，張邦綸撲空，二比二又成和局。是時李垚傷愈重行下場，此後華聯攻勢頗多，卅分鐘時阿孫小傳空擋，高秀淸窺得眞切，一撥入網，三比華聯三度領前。距終塲尙有八分鐘時，何應芬自拉自唱，建功而歸三比三和局。時間完畢，雙方各以三球握手言和，皆大歡喜。</p>

<h3>吳市長昨已返滬　配米辦法決定改善產地人心虛軟錫粳已回跌</h3>
<p>吳市長於上週五夜車赴京，出席全國物價會誤，業已公學，於昨晨返滬。據悉關於本市改善食米配給辦法，中樞當局已同意·並准撥配糧供應，該項改善配米辦法，今日可公佈實施。</p>
<p>吳市長返滬後，即以電話通知米業公會理事長瞿振華，飭其轉吿同業安心營樂，市府當予以週密保護，搶米打店自當嚴辦，米商囤積軌外行動，亦必嚴懲。故今日起，米業南市塲準備恢復正常營業，至北市塲則已於上星期六恢復交易云。</p>
<p>連日南北市到船日多，沿途已無阻撓情形，據米商推測，米價退入二十萬關內極屬可能，惟歡會局所拋配給米。各米店仍拒絕購領，此事聞已由吳市長嚴厲吿誡。</p>
<p>據米市塲昨日接無錫產地報吿，錫粳（白米）每石已回跌至廿四萬二千五百元，由產地運至上海，另加一萬餘運費。同時據報產地人心虛軟，繼續看跌。</p>
<h3>上海貨物稅局　調整捲烟稅額</h3>

<h3>國行稽核處發表　重要各地利率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行稽核處發表全國各重要城市利率調査表，放款日拆仍以鎭江每千元收六元爲最高，次爲寗波之五元五角，再次爲天津濟南之五元，上海，南京，杭州，漢口，溫州，石家莊，淮陰，則均四元五角。北平四元，重慶三元五角，成都，貴陽，廣州，均三元，昆明三元三角，最低仍爲錦州之一元二角。</p>

<h3>華南桐油走私猖獗　輸廣會擬就辦法呈請施行</h3>
<p>輸出推廣會最近接廣州辦事處電稱，該地桐油走私猖獗。港政府宣佈本年第一季出口桐油達一萬七千餘噸，海關報吿同期內經廣州出口桐油數額　數十噸。國外市塲價格因之自三角二分跌至二角八分，此事予正當出口商以鉅大影響。一般出口商對當局放任走私，咸抱反感。茲悉該會現擬就二點，呈政院審核後，分別實施。（一）四川存有桐子二萬噸，沿江東運來滬，今後桐油出口，仍擬以上海爲最大出口港。（二）組織華商輸出入管理委員會，由輸入輸出機構，海關及地方機關合組。該地由於國際關係特殊，故緝私工作在未與港政府配合行動前，廣州方面決單獨先行採擇若干步驟，由輸廣會加强廣州辦事處工作，獎勵撿舉，增加警衛力量，嚴行緝私云。</p>
<h3>物價高漲下　腸衣輸出停頓</h3>
<p>據出口業某權威表示，腸衣贛出，戰前以英美市塲爲大宗，每年輸出總額平均約一千二百萬美元，織後滅至八百萬餘美元，該項陽衣，外人除用以製造　　之縫口線及羊腸絃網外，並用以製作食品，用途極廣。我國西北各省均有出產，而以甘肅省產量最豐。該省每年平均約可產五十萬根。滬地目前因收購價格奇昂，不僅無利可圖，且須虧本。因此目前腸衣緻出已陷無形停頓。</p>

<h3>從「救災第一」到「剿匪第一」</h3>
<p>— 長沙五日航訊·本報駐汀記者黃潮如</p>
<p>湘省去年秋收，算有七成的收入，湘南收了七成，應該家紛戶足，加以偌大的救濟物資遷到湘省來，災民當然復蘇了。可是，現在湖南的情形，不僅家不給，戶不足，災情的嚴重，並不减於去年。</p>
<p>現在湖南農村的情形，最普遍的是患資金，種籽，耕牛等項之不足，去年災時，因爲救災工作做得不够，災民賴以圖存者，除掉吃草根樹皮外，唯一的辦法就是乞靈於高利貸。秋收所獲，由是悉以償還貸款，老早就呈室無餘栗的慘象。工賑物資到了少數人的口袋裏，不僅湖南建設沒有一點進步，災民也未受到「以工代賑」的實惠。現在，去年災區的災象，依然未减。</p>
<p>靑黃不接　災荒恐難避免</p>
<p>湘省名宿周斕老先生，日前由湖南祁陽原籍到省，對往訪記者談湘南災情，他是來自民間，目擊今日湘南農村情形的所以結語是「今年並不如理想之圓滿，湘南災荒，恐有重演之勢。」是的，今年湘南災荒之重演，將是無法避免的事實。不信的話，當心今年靑黄不接的時候，事實將怎樣吿訴我們。</p>
<p>王主席在「救災第一」口號喊過以後，接着是「剿匪第一」。當他喊「剿匪第一」口號時，湖南正是匪警頻傳。但那時的匪不過小股散匪，潢池弄兵，尙非大患。誰知這個口號喊出之後，湖南的匪警，由散匪而進步到有組織的共匪，刻下共匪正在多匪的湘西山地，横衝直撞，不僅已是深嘗過共禍滋味的湘人個個談虎變色，就是中央也注目於此了。</p>
<p>李先念部　回竄汀西叢山</p>
<p>此次竄擾湘西的共軍，是李先念的殘部李人林，王定烈兩部，人數約二千餘。他們是去年農歷春節前後由鄂境興山竄到巴東，渡過長江。當時宣傳傳：此批殘匪已被消滅，誰知經過一兩個月的時間，突由鄂境鶴峯一帶竄入湘西，一度竄至沅陵，桃源間的洞庭溪，準備偷渡沅水，經嚴予防　始向西回竄。湘西均是叢山峻嶺，地瘠民貧，而民情强悍，素有民匪不分的情形。共匪竄入該區，不啻猛虎入山，蛟龍得水，軍　民團雖然天天喊圍剿，其實未能傷他們半根毫毛，所以來去自如，如人無人之境。現在人數已有增加，圍剿的成績，此刻尙談不到。</p>
<p>撲滅星火　加重政治力量</p>
<p>兩三千人數的共匪，照說並不足重視，只要政府能加重一點軍事力量，相信必能全部解決。所令人憂慮的，王李兩匪此番竄湘，與普通匪行不同，截至現在止，他們所經之地，尙極少騷擾情事的報吿，測其作用，政治意義重於軍事意義。在旣「窮」且「愚」的湘西，經過他們的煽惑以後，確有幾分可憂。星星之火，可以燎原。假使不能及早撲滅，湘鄂川黔的邊境，誰又能担保安靖？而撲滅此星星之火，僅憑軍事力量似亦不够，應該同時加重政治力量。如何加重政治力量呢？以王主席的平穩作風，施之於平時，尤其是久病之後的湖南，固然尙能適合需要，但是對付共匪，那就非大刀闊斧的幹不可，只要政治淸明，地方安定，任他共匪「口吐蓮花」，亦無法獲得立足之地。如果爲叢驅雀，爲淵驅魚，那就太糟糕而且太危險了。時間是最可寳貴的，我們希望湖南當局把握時間，來個政治與軍事並重的剿匪大捷！</p>

<h3>如蛇吞象　如魚饞餌　劉伯誠犯豫北</h3>
<p>— 本報記者范世勤　鄭州五日航訊</p>
<p>黃河回歸古道以後，劉伯誠沒有辦法在豫東隴海路偸鷄摸狗，於是跑到豫北平漢路去幹好事。他總是對這鐵路過不去的，找不到隴海路的麻煩，就在平漢路玩花樣。因此，弄得豫北平漢路烽火迎天起，寃魂遍野哭了。</p>
<p>劉伯誠眞是蛇的心，他想把這近五百華里的豫北平漢鐵路一口氣吞到肚子去。事情是想這樣子做法：把黄河鐵橋一炸燬，把從黄河鐵橋起至安陽道一長段鐵路拿在手裏，然後他只要一張口不是全把它吞在肚子裏了嗎？三月底，四月初，他都這樣試過，然而，結果，白象不是蛇所吞得下的。</p>
<p>孫氏拒降　堅稱我守我城</p>
<p>成塊的吞不下，那末只有一塊一塊切着吃。劉伯誠對於現在豫北平漢路就是這樣做法了。所以在他黄河鐵橋邊先敗後，就集中力量改道淸洛與平漢路交叉點的汲縣，結果，他沒有把汲縣拿到，但是拿到了洪縣，於是豫北平漢路就被他切成兩段。這樣以後，自然先吃湯陰，然後再吃安陽。</p>
<p>費了二十七天工夫，劉伯誠才吃到湯陰，這也够他辛苦。原來，他不想付什麽代價，去吃湯陰。當初他以爲湯陰在他包圍中，只要一張「勸降書』，就可以坐享其成。可是，守城國軍的孫殿英，也是一個硬鐵漢，他接到劉伯誠的「勸降書」後，寫了一封「拒降書」給他，信裏說：「你有種，你攻你的，我有種，我守我的；我沒有種，我不守我的城，你沒有種，你也不必胡語了。」</p>
<p>紙鳶詭計　一段傳奇故事</p>
<p>劉伯誠至此，乃用紙鳶計，向城裏散發傳單，這傳單是說城一定恐慌得很，還是『降了爲是」。這裏聽到一段傳奇的故事。說是孫殿英用繩子吊請一個共產黨人進了城，請他大吃一餐，還請他看了一塲戲，然後又用繩子吊送他出了城。臨別之時，孫老殿對那位共產黨人說：「老弟可見到城裏情形，回去報吿一番。」</p>
<p>這人戲劇性的故事，還是孫老殿這裏辦事處傳出來，以這故事來說明共軍的『勸降』，與孫老殿的「拒降』，眞是極佳的傑作。歷史上有斬使拒降的故事，然而其妙不如孫老殿請使拒降多多。孫老殿於城陷數小時前發出遺囑以後，迄無消息。孫老殿這角色在這時代舞台上下了台，還是再要登台，看其命運如何了。</p>
<p>湯陰安陽　只是鈎上之餌　劉伯誠目前在支隊外面重新佈置，目的自然想吃這兩塊肉，支隊守軍是有名的李鐵頭（振淸），那塲武劇怎樣演法，不必去說他。還是正經地說說這劉伯誠傢伙如此饕餮下去，不是把豫北幾百萬民命都作他俎食了嗎？</p>
<p>豫北的戰局，眼前國軍取守勢，這是很顯然，不久以後，國軍一定要改變爲攻勢的，那時就是貪饞無饜的劉伯誠末日的時候。湯陰，安陽正是一個鈎上的餌食，一日國軍緊握着的從黄河鐵橋起至新鄕的一條鐵魚竿一起，那末，劉伯誠吞了的餌食要吐出來，也不可能了。</p>
<p>津浦路也好，大戰局是這樣的：國軍是直道而行，打通這鐵路，使南北一起，共軍是横道而行，摧毁這鐵路，使東西一起，所以這東西南北交叉之間，正是交鋒的地方。天說：直道而行者昌，横道而行者亡。天又說：得天者存，逆天者亡。</p>
<h3>鼙鼓聲裏　晉省難民訴衷情</h3>
<p>— 太原五日航訊　本報通訊員忠恕</p>
<p>在鼙鼓聲遍傳全晋極度緊張局面中，特對讀者報吿歲項人民遭受歷史上空前慘苦事件：中共向以「人民」與「民主」自詡，而事實所表現，人民却是不但不願接受他們的「恩惠」與「民主」，相反的却是共軍將到之處，人民逃遁惟恐不急，人們離家鄕，捨財物，甚至有中途遺棄子女者，其慘痛眞非想像所可及。近來由各地逃來太原者，已有數萬之衆，其餘則散居於晋北忻縣，晋中壽陽，檢次，祁縣，太谷，晋南臨汾，運城等地，於以造成政治上一大累贅問題。（一）據孟縣人談他們領教了共黨十年的統制，如容易盼到國軍到達，今國軍撤退，他們只好隨國軍西來，雖然縣長和軍政長和軍政長或侮辱，所以隨縣政府西退者，即有一萬數千人，自動散居四方的，尙不止此數。現在盂縣城週廿里內，老少男女已不留一人，一日兩大車老幼男女，行至乾河，不幸遇共軍一部，當時即以機槍掃射，刹時間，人畜無一生存。（二）趙城來人談：他們縣里，當國軍撤退時，壯丁首先自願隨軍當自衛隊，協助國軍作戰，隨後老幼也一齊逃往臨汾了。（三）定襄來人談：該縣留暉村自耕農段隆光，被共軍將田產沒收，房舍分給隨共軍算老賬的人，並令立即拆去，否則縱火盡焚，更强迫段某交銀洋一百五十元，段某拿不出來，吊了兩爐香（兩柱香燃盡）的時間，段某爲人誠樸，向爲村人所推崇，全村人民具狀懇情，共方還是短文不成，不得已由衆人三元二元集足百五十元之數交出，才算了事，但段某之兩手已吿脫離肢體矣。</p>
<h3>鴨綠江上</h3>
<p>— 五月一日航訊　本報記者趙展寄自瀋陽</p>
<p>從瀋陽乘車到安東去，出遼中平原，沿長白山脈東南行，穿越重山峻嶺，經過優美的風景區。暮春天氣，雜草野花，山育水綠，必暢人意。小河流水已緩緩地泛着黄波。</p>
<p>交通暗影</p>
<p>在安瀋路車上，我們吃加利福尼亞的甜蜜葡萄乾，流通券五十元一小盒，可謂價廉物美。</p>
<p>鴨綠江畔的安東市是一個突出點，她需要的食糧全靠由瀋陽運來，安瀋綫成了她的生命線。安瀋綫一月通車，二月又中斷，三月再修復，中斷二十天之間，糧價上漲一倍，通車之後糧價稍跌，但仍有上漲趨勢，交通前途不可樂觀，「糧荒」仍然是卅萬市民生活的暗影。</p>
<p>安瀋綫全長二百六十公里，橋樑隧道之多爲東北之冠。最長的福金嶺隧道長四千八百八十四呎。去年十二月間國軍進駐安東時，共軍棄走之前加以澈底破壞。後經搶修通車，橋樑均有枕木架成，夏季洪水時期，這種臨時便橋只好付諸東流。這是安東最焦急的問題，欲及時搶修，財力物力困難，交通當局束手無策。</p>
<p>安不政情</p>
<p>安東共有十五縣二市，經國軍收復十一縣二市，三月中共軍又侵據了金川等北部五縣。以收復地區來說，只有兩個縣是完整接收了，即安東和莊河。安東大部是山地，糧產原可自給，但戰亂之後却全靠外省濟助了，這增加了安東省政的困難，主席高惜冰先生可說是一個親民之官，最近他因感於無法解決民生痛苦而堅決辭職，未獲准許。他本人是工業人材，安東鳳城人，現年五十一歲，美國羅威爾紡織大學畢業，做過新疆建設廳長，是一個菩薩心腸的彪形大漢。</p>
<p>安東確已赤貧，一般農民沒有兩個月的存糧，在春荒的脅迫之下，春耕無望，春天是農民由肌餓過渡到死亡的時期。共軍盤據一年兩個月的期間，發行三千萬元「東北本票」，禁止使用他種籌碼，强制規定流通劵與東北本票是二與一之比。因此刦光了民間財富，高主席說：在他的故鄉鳳城，七家人家找不出五百元洗通劵，可見民間窮到什麽程度。今年安東田賦停徴，農民很感激中央的德意。</p>
<p>安東敎育復員的成績較好，接收地區文化水準較高，中學校復員達原狀之百分之八十，有學生九千六百餘名，國民敎育復員達百分之六十，學生十萬五千餘人。共軍盤據時期男女合校，現在實行男女分校。</p>
<p>三大特產</p>
<p>豐饒的國境綫安東，物產之富久爲日人所垂涎，日人曾在這裏做其美麗的工業之夢。安東最寳貴的物產當推木材，柞絲，菸草；此處礦產有煤，鐵，金，銅，鉛，煤質量不佳。鐵質優良而產量不鹽，金藏量約二公噸，豆油也是大宗產品。</p>
<p>在北部的長白·濛江·撫松等縣，尙有千年高齡的原始森林，蒼蒼鬱鬱不見天日，面積約四百萬立方米。如能充分利用，東北每年需要補充枕木二十萬根不成問題，並可有大宗木材出口。目前在共軍控制之中，木材來源完全斷絕。記者曾去參觀東北生產管理局安東分局製材廠，該廠原是僞滿牧丹江木材工業株式會社，由關東軍及僞滿實業部集　創辦，能造載重三百噸的大木船，規模很大。生產管理局接收了這個廠的材料，以材料維持老弱三百餘工人的生活。該廠被共軍破壞百分之八十，現僅有百餘隻未完工的船架，像魚骨一樣擺在廠裏。</p>
<p>柞絲是生長在柞樹上的一種蠶絲。安東產量佔全國百分之七十，佔世界產量百分之五十。柞絲工業在僞滿時代並不發達，窺其用意，是日人恐怕抵制日絲銷路，日人曾破壞了三分之一的柞樹。安東建設廳長李酉山先生說：今年可恢復六分之一，明年可望全部恢復。記者參觀安東省府的民享加工第一廠，出品柞絲。該廠原由日人西原富士，瓦斯會社創辦，創於民國七年，爲遠東兩大柞絲廠之（另一在東京），資本一千萬元，原有錠子九千五百，月產柞絲四萬五千斤；現餘錠子二千，月產柞絲一萬斤，出品運銷上海。</p>
<p>菸草是有前途的物產，產於岫岩·鳳城，質與黔菸相稱。鳳城月人菸稅一億元。我參觀過資（本報記者趙展寄）委會接收的造紙廠，都殘破不堪，復工甚爲困難。</p>
<p>鴨綠江在嚴密封鎖之下，眞是「白浪空流，風帆無影」。對岸是北韓新義州，長達三千零九十八呎的鴨綠江大鐵橋被織絲網封閉。登安東名勝鎭江山，一片大江景色盡在眼底，動興感慨！關於鴨綠江通航問題，我方正與蘇軍交涉中，最近可望通航。在九一八事變之前，鴨綠江的警察權究全在我國。現在形勢已非，如誰敢大胆的在江上行船，蘇軍就開槍射擊，因此苦了我國與北韓的漁民，他們的生活失掉了保障。也杜塞了鴨綠江上游木材的出路。</p>
<p>水警的問題，政府甚爲重視，安東已成立水上警察局，訓練水上警察。森林警察亦在準備訓練中。</p>

<p>電綫陳腐請速修理</p>
<p>復興中路一七〇弄文賢里內電綫，因年久失修，綫外所裏橡皮俱已脫落，手觸在雨天水泥墻上，略感麻木，諒必走電之故。而該弄之房屋多屬陳舊，隨時有走電焚燒之危險，故請電燈公司速派員前來査騐修理，以預防火災而安平民。並請吿知電燈公司地址，以便直接向其請求。（文賢里居民）編者按上海電力公司在南京路江西路口，祈洽。</p>
<p>吉祥弄電燈光黯淡</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>鄙人住南市荳市街吉祥弄，該弄內電燈，發光黯淡不見人面，尤其在弄口黑暗更甚，行人往往迎面相撞，但近裏馬路一帶，光明如畫，（因是新造棚戶由路燈接入）務請華商電氣公司，早日改接，則弄內居民即可重見光明，感恩非盡矣。（應兆良）三十六年四月廿六日</p>

<h3>澹盦幸草跋</h3>
<p>— 顧一樵</p>
<p>梁溪王次淸先生，旣以梅墅集問世，傳誦日衆，或問余曰：次淸先生之令兄芙橋先生，素以才氣縱横名於時，其詩文可得而誦敷？余應曰唯：君嘗讀靑牛道人六十自序乎？自序有云二</p>
<p>「因集自少至老所爲詩，删九而存一，自爲舊稿，偶存自娛而已。」</p>
<p>是則删餘之作，原不及什一，况芙橋先生以已卯歸道山，享年七十有五，此十五年間，不知更去若干？今距先生之歿，七閱暑寒，歷經滄桑，不知刦後遺稿猶存幾許？是則「澹貪幸草」之刋印，實不可或緩已。</p>
<p>先生嘗題梅村集五律，楊凌洲叔岳讀至「名高誤白頭」句，拍案呌絕，即以五十自壽詩索和，今檢讀遺稿，猶存絕響，豈非幸事？</p>
<p>「祭酒風流歇，殘編歷幾秋？關河遺老涕，禾黍故宮愁；筆直追靑史，名高誤白頭；凄凉庾開府，臥病憶南州」。自序又曰：</p>
<p>「吳君硯農，生死交情，評余詩在婁江新城之間，此一知已；侯翔千先生評予遊靄園詞云：節短韵長，髣髯朱竹坨雨花台賣花聲詞，此一知己。華君若溪，相逢京邸，呼余詩伯，楓橋分手，殷殷再訂後晤，此一知已。楊君范夫，賞余山遊詩，『夜遊如已倦，借我石牀雲』句，……此一知己。……杜君子撝，見余題龍潭授飯圖五古，評爲格律謹嚴，不愧作家，此一知己。陶君端翼，目余爲歲寒松柏，此亦一知己。」</p>
<p>嗟呼！遊樂園詞，山遊詩，龍潭授飯圖諸作，今已散佚無存，天喪斯文，豈不惜哉！</p>
<p>芙橋先生，諱鏡蓉，字芙伯，又字少泉。以同治四年，丁丑十一月初六冬至日丑時，生於薪州官廨。故自號蔪僧，晚號二泉，澹翁，符百老人，別稱靑牛道人。祖恩緩，字樂山，一字佩綸，以知縣楝發湖北，至武昌方被圍，乃率子爕，及家人丁貴，吳福壽，縋城入。城破，巷戰死，事聞於上，謚武愍，立專祠，賜祭葬，雲騎尉世職，翰林院立傳。配楊夫人，國學生綏章女，父庭楨，字子泉，又字幹臣，咸豐乙卯順天榜副貢生，兼襲雲騎尉，補授湖北施南府，武昌府知府，有政聲，祀名宦。配李夫人，壬午舉人，廣東從化縣任殉節，謚剛烈，仲謙公女，同治十年辛未，先生年方七歲。臥病荆裏舟次。越二年，始避黄鶴樓。光緒三年丁丑，十三歲隨子泉太守之施南府任，始操筆爲文。己卯生日，塡東風第一枝曰：</p>
<p>「昔遇陽生。（余生日恰逢冬至）今逢雪霄。四頭十五年矣！作宵尙算冲齡，今朝已非稚齒。流光如駛，下帷讀，請從今始。須圍爐，鎔鑄詩書，炙硏揣摩文史。」（半　）</p>
<p>壬午十八歲，黄宗師體芳，歲人無錫縣學，撥府第一名庠生，受知盱眙汪罕　師，歲試高等補增，受知湘澤王益吾師，即刊湘中六家詞者也。嗣後南北闋，五試皆不第，曾有詩曰：</p>
<p>「豈有成連三尺琴？敢云海內少知音！祗事師長裁成意，莫慰高堂屬望心！」癸未子泉太守，調武昌府任，丙戌春三月。解組歸田，爲先生娶同邑溧陽訓導，楊作舟公長女，八月子泉公，攖危疾棄養，年甫五十有一，時芙　先生年二十二，次淸先生方十八耳！恪遵古禮，哀毁逾恒，百日不絕哭，百日不茹葷，鄕里咸稱孝；而先生昆仲猶以爲未足也。戊子施南人士，赴秋試者，請祀子泉太守名宦。芙橋先生復遊於楚，作旅夜詞，用何事雲輕散韵曰：</p>
<p>「鄕夢俄頃散。恁凄凉，覺來還見月明星爛。別恨迢迢江水闊，何况秋聲無算。回首望，衡皋雲斷。憶坐憶眠欹枕久，漸玉繩耿耿低銀漢。潘鬢綠，暗中換。庚寅與內弟楊味雲先生，同遊忍草菴，訪貫華閣遺址，乃用曝書亭集中登胥山韵，作五古曰：</p>
<p>「梁汾昔夜坐，百感塡胸膺；伏櫪志徒壯，登高賦空能。買酒澆窮愁，賴有知心朋；來生綠預注，風義古所矜；留影空堂中，幻跡維摩徴。……我輩復登陟，依舊危檻憑，風流二百年，陵谷俄摧崩；僅餘廢閣址，未改貫華稱；客有述遊者，南嶽北逾恒；故鄕咫尺地，翻笑歷未曾。……」</p>
<p>癸巳，母李太夫人謝世，先生葬子泉公及太夫人於惠山馬鞍塢，並作行述曰：</p>
<p>「但期語語摭實，不敢蹈虛譽其親，自謗其親之誚，唯當代立言君子採覽焉。」</p>
<p>子泉爲殉難武昌，賜諡武愍公三子，李太夫人爲同邑殉難從化，賜諡剛烈公次女，恭順性成，幼待母胡太淑人。甲寅秋，剛烈公在粵殉節，於哀毁之中，調護母及姊母，動合禮法。居喪不延浮屠，遵剛烈公之遺訓也！歲癸亥，年二十九，方來歸子泉公，越二年，乙丑乃生芙橋先生；又二年丁卯長女晴芬生，後歸澄江陳氏。又二年己已次淸先生生；又二年，辛未次女惠芬生，後歸昆陵馮氏。太夫人平生惡衣廳食，未嘗妄費一錢一帛，或饋輕煖甘脆之品，則撤以賜老幼。其弟李豫嚴先生，爲邑之名師，余父及伯父，均就學焉。其妹歸西漳唐，早卒，無子，周恤靡間，撫其繼室之子，如己甥焉。</p>
<p>光緒三十年，甲辰芙橋先生重遊忍草菴，紀以詩曰；</p>
<p>「十載前曾此拂苔，携兒今日又重來：貫華舊閣渺何許，積翠中天安在哉？鳥啄靑紅山果落，僧言黄白菊花開。傳聞虎阜堪遙矚，下嶺還將首屢回。」</p>
<p>是時，先生長男祖庚九歲，次男祖聰六歲，長女敏方四歲也。翌年乙巳十月之望，先生携兒泛舟惠麓，有五古紀遊曰：</p>
<p>「今年孟冬望，日暖兼風淸，呼兒早餐去，喚棹出北城；迤邐江尖至，突兀黄埠明；過橋認柱字，隔樹數瓜棚；仰看白雲幻，俯視綠水平；一櫓換一景，與兒細論評；不覺碧山岫，已見當面横；九龍何夭矯？塔勢凌烟雲，艤舟龍山脚，山笑若相迎。……」</p>
<p>宣統元年己酉，作三遊忍草菴記，喟然嘆曰：</p>
<p>「洎乎宣絲初元，予挈兒子祖庚，三遊茲菴，則所謂中天積翠者，芟夷殆盡；殿宇亦非復前狀，益用喟然！梁汾容若二先生有靈，必有人提倡風雅，重建此閣者！余將拭目俟之。」</p>
<p>後十六年乙丑，其內弟楊壽枬味雲，乃重修貫華閣，設龍祀梁份容若，及鄕先賢；樊樊山曾撰賦張之。</p>
<p>宣統三年辛亥，先生三男祖秀方六歲，生而韶秀，眉目如畫，四閱春秋，即嬰危疾，纏綿牀蓐，一載有餘，竟爾殂謝，傷悼無已！其代內哭兒絕句曰：</p>
<p>「嗟兒一命委塵埃，挽救無方淚滿腮；聊取硃砂爲臂印，他生再到我家來！是年夏，重修王氏宗譜，余外祖父藎承公，與芙伯次淸二舅，實主其事，不收丁捐。余外祖父出銀二十三元，芙伯次淸二舅，各出十五元云。</p>
<p>民國四年乙卯，得其祖武愍公，七十一年前草書小軸眞蹟，作徴詩啓曰：</p>
<p>「鏡蓉早年耽隱，中歲逃禪，綽有祖風，旣愧梁公之後、奮興壯志，復慙伏波之孫，方惕深兩世遺型，忽重觀大父舊蹟。焚香品賞，不厭百回，劃几追墓，幾於萬遍。第覺結構嚴整，神氣幽閑，歲在甲辰，時維端午，石泉洗研，芳留壓角之章，野水入池，手錄還嬰之句。自落紙以迄署款，無一偏鋒，無一懈峯，當永寳也，夫豈偶然？……</p>
<p>翌年丙辰，又得其父名宦公，三十六年前草書横幅眞蹟，作徴詩啓曰：</p>
<p>天胡太酷，喪吾父於曰艾之年；物有攸歸，愴遺蹟於還珠之日。鋒稜峭拔，筆端競走龍蛇，局陣縱横，腕底如來風雨；得米顚之神髓，紹羲獻之眞傳。多麗塡詞，廿八聲餘芬未沫，庚辰至今，卅六載墨瀋猶新。天壤間呵護長留，家乘上絕無僅有，蓋楚中三佛閣，老僕所收藏，而施州間月亭題壁之副墨也。……</p>
<p>民國七年，有戊午草，八年有已未草，九年有庚申草，均已付印。辛酉草壬戌草，擬編未刋，今存者，辛酉山行示聰兒，有七古曰：</p>
<p>「今年未着登高屐，此日來遊也不妨！菊瘦蟹肥新酒美，放遲一月作重陽。……」</p>
<p>又記昔年冒雨遊忍草菴，用甲辰舊韵曰：</p>
<p>「昔年曾到草菴來，陡整斷崖絕點埃；鳥啄靑紅山果落，僧言黄白菊花開；茅簷承漏無憂渴，栗圃豐收聊自煨。指點虎邱烟雨裏，下峯步步首重回。」</p>
<p>民國十三年甲子，作靑牛道人六十自序，又自壽七律四首，其第一首曰：</p>
<p>「冬至陽生吾以降，敢云禀賦得天隆！病多常累先親護，才少寗能涉世工；冠歲父憂傷愛日，此年母喪聽悲風；自憐孤露思彝訓，啓後承先愧撫躬！」</p>
<p>是年長妹晴芬歿，享年五十有八，晴芬歸江陰陳君以晋。旣婚，北上覲舅姑，至楊柳靑而夫疾作，卒於旅次，痛不欲生。抵京，舅姑勉以守志，爲夫立後，苦節三十六年，幸賴芙伯次淸昆季，骨肉情深，聊堪相慰耳！</p>
<p>歲庚午，楊夫人仲妹浣芬，六十壽。浣芬歸江陰章君紱雲，章君著有勺軒詩鈔，浣芬唱和諸作，有憶蓉室詩草，後二載，壬申歸福建龔君甫之，三妹韵芬六十壽，芙橋先生代幼佩夫人撰句以祝。曰：</p>
<p>「設帨良辰樂酒盃，同胞姊妹阻燕台；自從別後相思苦，直欲趨前握手來。</p>
<p>「阿姊明年將七旬，差欣老健與時新；遙知萊綵聯翩舞，羨煞天倫樂最眞。」時芙橋先生年六十八，楊夫人年六十七，梁孟齊眉，均近古稀，已足羨煞人世，後先生壽至七十五，楊夫人壽至七十七，淡泊終老，堪稱神仙眷屬矣！</p>
<p>歲辛未先父五十紀念，先生撰文曰：</p>
<p>「嗚呼！吾晦農妹丈，逝世幾何年矣？猶憶七先叔曾語余曰：晦農生平任事熱心，疎財仗義，其事蹟自有不可湮沒者；子盍爲之傳，以諗其來。許乎？……晦農本吾妹淸，又重之以婚烟，其可無一言以副吾誦芬從妹之託乎？……」</p>
<p>蓋光生以愛女歸余長兄毓琦，故於余父又爲親家也。爲文意有未盡，殿以七古一章：</p>
<p>「虎頭門祚今方隆，不應遽死吾晦農；闌玉盈階正挺秀，一朝失庇悲霜風！……賢哉吾妹收淚起，重擔千鈞吾敢弛？務使一房墜緒綿勿替，在天雖亡如不死！……」</p>
<p>嗚呼！先父棄養，年纔三十有五，余兄弟行能無似，欲賴先生之詩文以傳於世。先生性甘澹泊，歷經滄桑，雖年逾古稀，猶不欲以詩文壽世，今余兄嫂旣囑余整理遺稿，編列年次。三十年孤兒血淚，終得賴長者之詩文，使懷椿閣屹立於三光之下，則吾父爲不死矣！此又余母之志也。敢不泣而誌之。</p>

<h3>風景（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 唐蘊玉</p>
<h3>鶴林寺訪米芾墓</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>京口山水，首推金焦北固，筆者去秋兩度遊覽，曾紀遊詩畫若千幀，博敎於同道倪祝華丈，丈以鎭江南郊竹林鶴林二寺，岩聲幽邃，林木葱龍，與三山者異其趣；且有北宋米芾南宮之墓，可資憑弔。余乃心嚮往之。上月杪，遊蘇後轉道京江，匆忙間又作半日小遊。</p>
<p>竹林與鶴林，離江較遠，非登高，無從挹長江之勝，此竹林寺之所以有「挹江亭」也。京口山水志載：米芾祠在鶴林寺左，今與祝丈來此探訪，祠已傾廢，渺無痕蹟，但見黄土一坯，藝人長眠之地，碑碣尙存。考其文則爲明季練國事記米萬鍾修墓始末。蓋米元章酷愛京江山水，生則卜居於此，沒乃營葬於是。碑截幷出陳繼儒眉公手筆，尤可珍視。余與祝丈徘徊其下，不忍遞去。想見南宮樂山成癖，允宜畫畫雙絕，爲北宋冠冕，其人其事，堪稱千古藝林之佳話矣。</p>
<p>南宮書法爲宋代四大家之一，所謂蘇黄米蔡者，南宮別饒龍飛鳳舞之緻。畫則烟雨縹渺，自成一格，推爲劃時代之宗師。惟其作品傳世者不多，山水尤尠。據「圖畫見聞志」，「晝繼」，「宣和畫譜」等畫史所載：僅有「海獄庵圖」，「山水小幅」，「文德皇后遺履圓」等若干幀，圖中林木陰醫，層次淸晣，人物，樓閣，屋宇，橋樑，漁艇等皆極其纖秀云。恐今已不在人間矣，余　見故宮博物院藏南宮「春山瑞松圖」眞蹟，紙本設色，高一尺二寸許，橫一尺六寸許，蒼松婀娜，濃淡參宜，松下草亭一，通幅筆畢極爲古拙，遠峯分主客之勢，苔用米點，雲氣瀰漫，神韵渾厚，略施淺綘，兼敷靑綠，沈着有勁，以視後世用粗筆濕墨，塗洒淋漓而仿米者截然不同。</p>
<p>但元章愛作墨戲，作畫不專用筆，或以紙筋，或用蔗滓，或用蓮房，乘興揮洒，毫無拘束。紙不用膠礬，不在絹紫上着筆，故其興到筆隨，神韵盎然。蓋生紙作畫，易收墨暈變化之趣，可知元章墨戲之作，固非復如「海嶽庵圖」等之織秀，而後人之墓擬，皆在此而未在彼也。</p>
<p>元章之畫，其子友紅虎兒爲嫡傳，世稱小米，點綴烟雲，酷守家法而能不失其天眞。其後元人中有高克恭房山，專學元章，造詣之精，一時無兩。方從義方　以道士而致力二米，瀟洒出塵，高入逸品。明人陳白陽山水，亦參米氏家法，董思翁雖非專學二米，然多南宮氣息，用時秀潤蘊藉，蔚爲晚明祭酒。遜淸以後，學米者頓不乏人，類皆失之縱横，米派山水，幾成廣陵絕響矣！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血506</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見一見這位不速之客，笑瞇瞇地站在當鬥，却是從來沒有見過的陌生人，不覺一楞。尤其呌他詫異的，上海除了這幾位來過的朋友外，沒有人知道他是鶴見。並且來人對這「鶴見」二字，是用的日本音「猪玀米。」而這發音之中，如其照北方人打起上海話的調調說出來，竟有些故意捉狹的意味。鶴見當時雖然錯愕，這個捉狹意味他却懂得；因當年幼時，同筆者在日本小學時代當兒，筆者曾把他這名字的上海發音和意義，吿訴過他，並且還常常喊出這個調調來，同他開玩笑哩。</p>
<p>鶴見對這來人，這般作弄，不管有意無意，按說應當有些生氣了；然而却又無法使出性了：什麼原故？因乍一見面，她的嗓音是那似甜脆，本人也一樣長得那似甜脆；雙頰像兩隻小蘋果，圓圓的一雙大眼睛，充分顯露着少女的嬌媚；梳着兩條小辮子，一隻掉在後面，一隻却崛强地撑在前面，愈加把她襯得十二分的頑皮。在鶴見眼光裏，她大槪僅有十六歲左右。</p>
<p>只在這一瞥眼乍見之下，鶴見的腦海裏，忽然觸動五六年前，初次會見紀耀羣的情景。換句話說，當前這位女郞的小影和五六年前的紀耀羣，竟是一個模樣：兩人一樣的健美，一樣的活潑，一樣的天眞。所不同的，耀羣當日在東北日寇惡勢力籠罩之下，神態上表現着滿腔鬱憤，這位少女却是一面孔的嘻笑頑皮。</p>
<p>「哦！……」鶴見這時的情感，大約是一片驚訝，疑慮，詫異，奇突，的混合，外加一絲絲好奇心理，和些微異想天開的希望。這一片混合的情感，把一個久經風浪，胸襟磊落的鶴見，攪混得有些打發不開：素日能言善辯，懸河滔滔的一張口，這時竟木訥訥地，像割去了半截舌頭似的，說不出一句話來。</p>
<p>在他這二十幾年的人生旅程裏，他有一位菊子，却是姊弟一般的關係，沒有男子對女子特殊應付的必要。當日碰到耀羣，鶴見正在深謀遠慮，計劃秘密組織，求才若渴；况且，當時雖在參謀總部，地位不高，潛勢力却也不小；對於耀羣，是一種同情援助的局面，情勢同能力，又能舉重若輕，所以應付耀羣的姿態，極其坦白自然，雖說其中難免滲合些微男女情感的成分。鶴見的處理上，並不大感覺任何困難。</p>
<p>其後在東京碰到萍子，那時的鶴見，本是準備孤注一擲，早把生死置之度外，對付萍子，只有敵友之分，並沒有男女之別，所以應付起來，並不感覺荆手。在北平遭到那個冒名川島芳子突襲的時候，鶴見的想像中，完全是「兵來將擋，水來土俺」的氣槪，並沒有管到對方是女的還是男的。</p>
<h3>不快的快事</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>勝利復員的途中，在從漢口到南京的輪船中，我看到一樁不快的「快事」。</p>
<p>我的艙房裏共有十幾隻床舖，男女雜處。我家佔了五隻舖，我居邊界。我對面的舖，是一個中年婦人和一個嬰孩的，有一次，我看見這婦人替嬰孩換尿布，解開尿布，惹我注目的是一大塊紅，仔細一看，原來是一面日本國旗。這旗是小型的，當作尿布用，那紅太陽正好承受嬰孩的臀部，不大不小，恰到好處，好像是特製的。我脫口而出！「啊！是日本國旗！」那婦人得意地說：「是呀！他爸爸從前綫拿回來的，很多，我都拿來當尿布！」她翻開被頭來給我看，果然有好幾塊。我看看她換下來的一塊，紅太陽的正中一堆黄黄的糞，旁邊都被小便浸濕。我搖頭嘆息：那婦人更加得意，說：「吃了他們幾十年的苦頭，今天翻翻梢（翻梢即復警，不知是否如此寫，待考。）出一口氣！哈哈哈哈」。我陪她一個「哈哈哈哈」。旁邊叧一人說：「道是一件快事！」</p>
<p>我想起了：抗戰以前，日本侵略中國，中國人痛恨日本，曾經有人駡日本國旗是月經布。他說：「世界的國旗，要算日本的最容易製造。日本女子月經來了，用一塊手帕塞住生殖器。明天拉出來，手帕中央圖圓的一塊紅，便成了國旗。」這雖罵得刻毒，但不過說說而已。如今拿日本國旗當尿布，却是實行。這眞是一件「快事！」但我覺得何等不快！</p>
<p>這種行爲太惡劣了！有如流氓的罵人，有如頑童的惡作劇。過去的日本固然惡劣之極。但我們豈可同他們一般樣呢？古訓：「不念舊惡，怨是用稀。」熟語：「寃家宜解不宜結。」如今他們已經屈膝投降，我們應該忘懷舊惡。這纔可表示我們的人格，而維護世界的和平。所以我看了那件「快事」，覺得不快，因爲這與我們的人格有關，與世界和平的前途有礙。</p>
<p>但後來我又想：月經與尿屎，科學地看來，與唾涕一樣，本無高下貴賤之別。如果世人皆作如是觀，那麽也就無妨了。卅六年五月七日。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>長安小酌</h3>
<p>— 克人</p>
<p>太白飲酒處</p>
<p>小東門外的八仙庵，相傳爲呂洞賓遇漢鍾離處；當初建廟的動機，也正是根據這種通俗神話中的八仙故事。香火至今未衰，春秋佳日，鄕曲婦嫗絡繹於途。距此東向數武，有大石碑一，深鐫「太白飲酒處」五字；傍搭一草棚，置矮脚長凳數列，中一老者當釜售米酒；據說數世業此，將近百餘年了。酒甘醇，可持碗牛飲，惟頗具宿勁；所謂「太白斗酒」的洒即屬此類。八仙庵一帶已是廂關荒僻之區，紳士淑女猶趨之若驚，蓋此翁米酒，允稱關中絕門也。</p>
<p>鷄絲拐臘子肉</p>
<p>臘子肉爲豬肉的一種特別醃燻法；肉成盤狀，紅白相映，熟極爛極；以之估酒，滋味無窮。長安市上處處皆有售者，小肆攤販不一，惟以東關鷄絲拐的一爿屠房售者爲最佳。按鷄絲拐有屠房三四家，此處所指爲路南高門戶者。長安著名小飲處多無名號，舊京風光，自屬不同。</p>
<p>老馬家臘羊肉</p>
<p>西北爲回敎根據地，市上淸眞幌子到處招搖，烹疱牛羊肉頗有精到處。</p>
<p>臘羊肉性質類似普通的醃牛肉，稍具醬肉的滋味，但却別出手法，別有天地；秋風天凉時，堪稱估酒佳品。</p>
<p>製售最精者推「老馬家」；惟多冒牌者，什麽「老老馬家」，「眞正老馬家」，有如北平王麻子剪刀舖，攪得人眼迷心亂，莫辨眞僞。內行的朋友吿訴我，西大街竹笆市東口的一家較爲考究；而成品所以有優劣，由於廚師製作工夫之高下者少，由於選購生肉時眼光明鈍與否者大；蓋何種性質的羊肉宜於製佳品，倒是需要硏究的。</p>
<p>竹笆市羊肉泡館</p>
<p>西北俗呼饅頭爲「饃」，泡顧也者，即以羊肉湯泡之食也。此種羊肉湯是用羊頭，羊蹄，羊肝，羊肉；等等燉成之「全羊鮮湯；」食之必加辣子少許，一以估味，一以鎭腥羶也。</p>
<p>法以凈麵烤成，不攙其他作料。泡時先由食客撕成小塊，再令堂倌取去加湯；如用刀切，則恐湯汁不易浸入。</p>
<p>據說竹笆市南口的一家羊肉泡饃館最著名。</p>
<h3>粉身碎骨</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>甲男：這個房間的牆壁上盡是斑斑點點。</p>
<p>乙男：最近住在這裏的房客是一位發明家——他發明一種炸藥。</p>
<p>甲男：噢，牆上這些斑點都是炸藥的眞跡了。</p>
<p>乙男：不是炸藥，是那位發明家。</p>
<h3>卓別麟將創造新式電影</h3>
<p>— 聯</p>
<p>笑匠卓別麟九日在紐約向記者發表談話，表示願意創造一種新式電影，風行世界，如其過去之啞劇然。</p>
<p>卓別麟現擬在其新片中取消輔助字幕及插音，而代以利用觀衆本國語言說明動作與對自。當說明人發言時，演員聲音應予淡化。據稱在其新片「凡爾杜先生」中即有大段對白決不能譯成字幕，除非聽衆了解英語，否則勢將喪失全部效果。此種新方法乃卓別麟藝術演進之第三亦即最後階段。</p>
<h3>如何解決米風潮</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>繼杭州米潮打風以後，無錦。蘇州，都有搶米風潮發生，不料上海也逃不了這個例外，七日平民搶米，八日竟發生了米商毆人打店。</p>
<p>米商痛苦，固有其癥結所在，但是平民的打店搶米，原是激於一時義憤，並不蓄意出此。現在米商們不此之圓，却也以行動來報復行動，假請願之名，集合羣衆，毆人毁店，自蹈法網，非惟前此同情於米店被打者心冷，即政府亦難庇護此一行動爲合法，吳市長答觀復米業代表之答語：已可概見，米商們之自討沒趣，深爲遺憾！</p>
<p>爲今之計：米商雖有警局警員保護發售配米，然依筆者觀之，還不够澈底。最好，將全市米店，一律　時收歸公營，米糧集中政府之手，統籌辦法，或即實施計口授糧，分區由區長會同地方士紳監督之，機關。工廠。學校以及公敎人員，則由其主管長官或負責人監督之；如此米商旣可雪「米蛀虫」之譏，政府又得試行分配政策，平民亦得信賴政府之供給「民食」也。</p>
<p>反之。今日平民打店，明日米商毆人，相互糾結，永無寗日，從政於上海市者，將不遑辦理其他事務，每日當以「勸架」，「鎭攝」爲急務，騰傳國外，亦將以上海退化到野蠻時期相談矣，願政府採納是幸，</p>
<h3>台上戲與台下戲</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>很偶然的看了久已不看了的平劇，而且是看了童芷苓的「拿手好戲」—紡棉花。</p>
<p>這齣戲風靡已久，記得過去曾一度禁演過，據說是因爲它的內容「太那個」了，同時，禁風一發生，這齣戲便更爲呌座，而童芷苓的大名也就從此確立在梨園內外了。據說最近她每紡一次棉花，凈到手八十餘萬，此番在天蟾舞台演出卅六天，包銀達八千萬元之鉅，便可覘見其賣座之盛！</p>
<p>筆者覺得童芷苓演出時的一股「勁」，固然不是什麽藝術的正路，但也並不如一股輕薄兒口中所傳的那麼可怕。怪只怪觀衆太「敏感」，他們一向慣於一看見「櫻桃小口」便會聯想到女人身上的某一部分，猶如讀到「金瓶梅」裏面潘金蓮呌了「達達」之聲便會情不自禁的「悠然神往」一樣。</p>
<p>老實說，筆者坐在那裏對於童芷苓在台上的戲毫無可驚可奇之處，所感到好奇的倒在台下觀衆所串演的戲。一個二十來歲的洋塲少年，當他看得入神的當兒，眞似乎在流漾着一股按耐不住的表情，並且不時地，無意識地，眉花臉笑，瞠目結舌，迴腸盪氣，怪聲呌好。還有一位坐在我前排的年在五十開外的老頭兒，一邊看着童芷苓，一邊却道貌岸然地說，「道成什麽戲！太不成話了！」要是這時不是在戲院子裏面，他準會破口大罵一通的吧，彷彿非如此就不足以退抑他的怒恨似的。而搖之以頭，嗤之以昇，拂之以袖，還算是他的客氣。然而我又想：也許是這位紳士先生想藉此安定他自己的「貞潔」的心吧？</p>
<p>本來是一齣無足輕重的戲，而偏偏有這麼多的觀衆，偏偏有如此這般的觀衆的臉孔和心理，一種是飄飄然，悠悠然的輕佻，一種卻是可怕的嚴肅，我乃發生了上述的觀感，特表而出之，就算它是一種梨園「風光」吧。</p>

<h3>滑稽的背後</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>日前某報刋載北平專電，說北大五四耙念週內，有戲劇晚會。當表演「一個女人和一條狗」的時候，竟有人上台質問：明明爲人，爲什麼題爲一條狗？叧一齣「凱旋」上演的時候，因爲劇情悲憤，觀衆爲之落淚，其中獨有一人，却鼓掌大笑，致令羣情激怒，欲加痛毆，旋經調解始罷。看了這兩件事情，實在覺得滑稽。有如傳說中戲台上表演曹操，台下有人要將他拖下來鞭打一般，這拿來放在幽默文字裏面，堪稱出色。台上與台下打成一片，本來足見戲劇感人之深，是一件好事。在現代戲劇之中，且有特地使觀衆成爲演員者。可是像上面的兩種情形，却又當別論。</p>
<p>一個戲題爲「一個女人和一條狗」，原是一種幽默，不幸看戲的人却要認眞起來，雖然此事本身比戲劇尤爲幽默，在當時却大大地不幽默了，相反地另一齣戲大概是一個悲劇，所以看的人跟着認眞起來，爲之一灑同情之淚。可是在觀衆一致落淚的時候，卻有一個人獨自發生幽默的感覺，反而鼓掌大笑。他這一點幽默的露，卻爲認眞的絕大多數不能忍受，以致激動公憤，欲加圍毆。想像到了那個時候，這位幽默的看客也就不能再行幽默下去了。</p>
<p>這兩件事情合起來看，令我們發生一種印象，就是現社會的失去常態。反常的事情，正在不斷地發生。把幽默的戲認眞來看而至於上臺質問，是反常；大家傷心落淚的時候而有人鼓掌大笑，也是反常。有人鼓掌大笑而羣情憤激欲加痛毆，也是反常。叧一個印象是彼此的不能忍受。幽默的譏諷嚴肅，嚴肅的不能忍受幽默。後者尤爲當世流行的通病。最後一個印象，是習俗與傳統的崩潰。看客上台質問，是一個明顯的例子。也許我的話說得不够明確。可是我們都可以看得出，現在正有一種潮流，在推翻着一切好的和壞的東西，不分皂白，造成一種混亂。這並不是革命，却値得大家警惕，我們至少要挽救那些値得留下的東西啊。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>跟着司機合座位的爭奪戰便激劇地展開了。</p>
<p>原坐在司機台上的差不多立刻就被全部趕了下去，蘭和緋緋當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>「這兒難道不坐人嗎？」張昌不服氣，首先衝過去，瞅着那個正在呼叱蘭和緋緋下車的瘦長條子的駕駛兵高聲地質問。</p>
<p>「不坐人！你怎麽樣？」那個駕駛兵斜着眼，沉下臉，傲然地回答。</p>
<p>血氣正旺的張昌，眼看立刻就要跟這個目中無人的司機老爺打起來了。</p>
<p>「張先生，你眞是個孩子！」蘭已經打司機台上跳了下來，帶着笑，把張昌攔住了。「我原不想坐在這兒。大家都坐在後面，不是更熟鬧嗎？」</p>
<p>張昌怒目握拳，狠狠地瞅了那個駕駛兵一眼；對方雖然比他更横，可是瞧佔坐的人如此客氣，已經自動先下車了，也就不願多事，只在鼻子裏哼了一聲，忙回頭去招呼另一個又矮又胖，手內提着許多大包小裏的女人上車。他怕這一個化錢的主顧如其再不上車，那蘭和緋緋讓出的座位很可能又被別的更凶横或有大來歷的人佔去的。</p>
<p>「絲絲，跟張叔叔玩！我先上車去看看」。蘭像根本沒有這會事一樣的鎭定，把緋緋交給了張昌，——爲的是怕他再和那個瘦長條子的駕駛兵打架——自已就很高興地爬上卡車的後部去。</p>
<p>叧外四輛車的司機台邊早已鬧得不可開交了。</p>
<p>張昌餘怒米熄，拉着緋緋的手，仍站在原處，瞪大着眼睛，盯住了那個司機和正在上車的那個大胖子女人。</p>
<p>「我來，我來！」那瘦長條子的司機老爺，正堆着滿臉的笑在照料他的大主顧，搶先替她放好那許多包裏，並且還用自已的一件舊衣服，折疊起來按在木製的條板上作爲墊子。</p>
<p>「他媽的！不知道韋了多少錢！」張昌的腦子裏這樣想。</p>
<p>但正當那司機打算攙扶他的大主顧上車的時候，掃興的事來了，一陣高統皮靴亂饗，打左邊來了四五個人，走在最前面的，就是年少的熊處長，他後面是一儒已〕過中年的穿着很精緻的西裝的瘦子，手裏拿一根極講究的手杖，右邊隨着一位年紀比他小一倍的不很美的女人；最後面還有一個峨冠佩劍的高級軍官，和兩個勤務兵，提着很小巧華貴的幾件簡單的行李。</p>

<h3>Two Routes of Chinese National Army Pursuit in Shandong, Recovered Tusi Pass North of Laiwu, Continuing Mopping-up Operations in Eight Cities Including Zibo</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Xuzhou Office, 11th] The National Army, which recovered Laiwu, continued on the 11th to pursue the defeated communist army along two routes, Laiwu-Boshan and Laiwu-Tusi Pass. In the afternoon, they successively recovered Xiaoyi Village, five kilometers northeast of Laiwu, Qin Village, six kilometers northwest of Laiwu, and Jiangjia Building. The National Army, which swept the mountains southwest of Laiwu, captured Xujia Village, seven kilometers from the city, and Xiangshankou and other high grounds on the 11th. Meiyang was also recovered by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Jinan Office, 11th] The National Army, taking advantage of their victory, recovered Tusi Pass, a key point north of Laiwu, at 2:00 PM on the 11th, and continued to mop up the surrounding area. By the evening of the 11th, the communist army had been cleared within ten Chinese miles northeast of Tusi Pass and retreated towards Zibo while fighting. The National Army is continuing to pursue them. Wang Yaowu's troops, who were flanking from Zaoyuan Temple to the east, arrived near Mingshui on the 11th. It is expected that the two National Army routes will officially converge between Tusi Pass and Mingshui.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 11th] The Chinese National Army in Shandong achieved a great victory. After the National Army regained control of Laiwu County, the severely damaged main force of the communist army is now fleeing through Boshan and Zichuan towards the vicinity of Zhangdian. Another part of them is fleeing through Tusi Pass towards Zuwen Town (north of Tusi Pass). After this fierce battle in Laiwu, the communist military situation in Shandong is gradually approaching its end.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] The battle in the Yimeng Mountains is nearing its end. The war situation in Shandong Province is gradually developing towards the central section of the Jiaoji Railway. After the National Army gained control of the entire western, southern, and northern Yimeng Mountains, the eight remaining cities in the northeast and southeast corners, Zichuan, Boshan, Linqu, Anqiu, Yishui, Juxian, Zhucheng, and Rizhao, are currently being mopped up by the National Army. The communist army, which fled northeast from Laiwu, declared that they would re-invade Weixian in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway and establish a new base in Laiyang on the Shandong Peninsula. The National Army is now taking advantage of their unsteady breathing and vigorously pursuing and annihilating them.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Yishui and Juxian were already within the artillery range of Tang Enbo's army corps on the 10th. Tanbu, west of Yishui, and Xiazhuang, Jiehu, Aishan, and Pingse, southwest of Juxian, are now occupied by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Xuzhou Office, 11th] The National Army, advancing towards Juxian along the right bank of the Shu River, reached Baidichou and Xiaodian, nine kilometers southwest of Juxian, on the 11th. Another National Army route searched and suppressed Dadian, fourteen kilometers southwest of Juxian, and almost completely annihilated more than 2,000 communist troops near Xiadian at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Xuzhou Office, 11th] The National Army at Mengyin Village on the Laiwu-Xintai highway continued to sweep the remaining communist troops in the surrounding steep mountainous areas on the 11th. Taohuayu, five kilometers west of Mengyin Village, Qingquan Ridge, seven kilometers away, Gaoyu, and Huangshan, Daxiao Shangyu, three kilometers southeast, were all captured by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Jinan Office, 10th] According to a military observer, although the Shandong communist army still controls four columns on the rear side of the National Army, the Second Column in Yishui and the Seventh Column in Dadian, south of Juxian, have been mostly annihilated by the National Army's First Army Corps, and their combat effectiveness is extremely weak. As for the Ninth Column north of Mengyin, it is under close surveillance by the National Army. The Sixth Column has been surrounded in Dabianqiao, between Xintai and Sishui, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all. In addition, the Zhang Guangzhong unit of the Lunan Military Region of the Communist Army, consisting of more than a thousand people in the mountainous area southeast of Yanzhou, are all guerrillas and militias and are not worth worrying about. In total, the communist army's losses in this battle should reach at least one-third or more. Finally, regarding the future movements of the Shandong communist army, there are three possible paths: (1) cross the Yellow River and flee north, (2) engage in another decisive battle with the National Army on the Jiaoji Railway, and (3) break up into smaller units and continue to hide in the Yimeng Mountains, choosing favorable times and locations to wear down the National Army.</p>
<h3>Communist Army from Changtuo Aids, Nong'an Declares Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Changchun Office, 11th] The communist army's offensive along the Changtuo Line has now approached Xinglong Town, north of the outer perimeter of Nong'an. Fierce fighting broke out on the morning of the 11th. Large numbers of communist troops continued to cross Chaigang and move south. More than 3,000 communist troops from Shengyu, northeast of Nong'an, and the communist army from Gaojiadian, northwest of Nong'an, also launched night attacks to the south. Nong'an declared martial law yesterday.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Changchun Office, 11th] In the Youjiatun, Xinkai River, and the area north of Laoye Ridge in northeastern Jilin, there have been skirmishes in recent days, with communist troops carrying out small-scale raids.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] The communist army north of the Songhua River seems to have stirred again in recent days. On the 9th, communist troops raided Halahai, north of Nong'an on the Changtuo Road, and on the 10th, they raided the vicinity of Wula Street, north of Jilin, but were defeated after counterattacks by the National Army. On the morning of the 11th, apart from a small-scale battle between the communist army and the National Army near Xinglong Town, north of Nong'an, all other places were relatively calm. Recently, there have also been scattered communist troops in the area east of Wen Siping. According to military sources, the communist army's forces that have crossed the river and the troops assembled on the north bank of the Songhua River have both reached a considerable number. The main force seems to be in the area west of the Changtuo Road. Judging from the current situation, their actions have not yet exceeded the scope of harassment. It is too early to consider this as the communist army launching their fifth offensive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 11th] The communist armies on both northeast sides of Jilin made probing intrusions yesterday, but were unsuccessful. The communist army that attacked Zhanglaotun, fifteen miles northeast of Wula Street, retreated to Dakouqin (twenty-five Chinese miles northeast of Wula Street) last night. The headquarters of the communist army's Jibei Military Region is currently stationed in Gangyao, Shulan County, and is still defended by about 1,000 troops under the command of Long Shue. A part of them has moved to Huatangou, about twenty-five miles east of Wula Street, to control traffic, allowing pedestrians to enter but not exit.</p>
<h3>National Army from Baoding Moves Northward, Defeating Marauding Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's Baoding Office, 11th] The communist army's movements around Baoding are still frequent.

At 10:00 AM, the communist army collapsed on both sides of the railway. In this battle, the communist army suffered more than 160 casualties and prisoners. The National Army is currently pursuing them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 11th] The Baoding Pacification Headquarters has established a special preferential treatment center to treat communist prisoners of war favorably, providing them with appropriate training and activities such as singing and self-study to cultivate their emotions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 10th] Recently, the communist army has been forcibly carrying out the "Anti-Lazy Wife" campaign in various places, giving each household four catties of cotton and forcing them to hand over six zhang of white cloth, euphemistically calling it the "Anti-Lazy Wife Campaign."</p>
<h3>Communist Army's Anti-Civil War Committee Prints and Distributes Seditious Books</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 11th] The Chinese Communist Party's Anti-Civil War Committee for New Soldiers has recently printed a book for the militia, saying: "Being a militia is truly pitiful. The Eighth Route Army treats you like chickens and dogs, not caring about your food and clothing in peacetime, and forcing you to the front lines in wartime, using your flesh and blood to exchange for iron bullets, causing your family to be incomplete. Fellow villagers, rise up and fight to eliminate the Eighth Route Army and protect peace."</p>

<h3>Urgent Measures to be Amended: Allocation of Goods to be Expanded; Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] The authorities are conducting a detailed study of the effectiveness of the economic emergency measures implemented thus far. According to authoritative sources, certain aspects of the plan are likely to be amended. With the cost of living already unfrozen, it seems unavoidable that subsidy policies will be reintroduced, and changes to the method of allocating goods are also deemed necessary.

Educational institutions and other departments have suggested adjusting salaries regardless of region, while establishing a separate method for allocating goods so that benefits are equal. The Accounting Department of the Executive Yuan is currently working on both regional and non-regional adjustment plans. Whether or not adjustments will be regional is currently unknown.

<h3>In Order to Reduce Issuance and Absorb Floating Capital, the Government Will Issue Special Short-Term Treasury Bills; Methods Under Study</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] To reduce issuance and absorb floating capital, the authorities will issue special short-term treasury bills in the near future. Detailed methods are currently being studied by Yu Hong-jun, Zhang Jia-ao, and others. It is reported that these treasury bills may have a term of one to three months, with interest rates the same as the highest in the market. National banks will be responsible for them, and commercial banks across the country will handle redemption procedures. Purchasers will buy them at 80% or 85% of face value in cash, and they will be redeemed at full value upon maturity. A financial expert analyzed the advantages of these new treasury bills to reporters on the 11th, pointing out that the key to ordinary treasury bill issuance is the level of interest. The sales of US treasury bills have been affected due to interest rate considerations. The special short-term treasury bills to be issued in the future will have the same interest rate as the market, and the credit of national banks is generally higher than that of ordinary banks. This is equivalent to fixed-term deposits, and it is believed that they will be able to absorb a large amount of floating capital. After the issuance of these treasury bills, there will be at least the following beneficial effects: (1) reduced issuance, (2) floating capital will not rush to purchase goods, prices will stabilize, and interest rates will fall accordingly. Finally, he optimistically stated that if the authorities can simultaneously advance in controlling prices and stabilizing the currency value after the issuance of special short-term treasury bills, the economic situation will not be difficult to improve.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 11th] The Peiping (Beijing) City subscription and sales amount for the 1947 short-term treasury bills and US dollar bonds is US$10 million, of which US dollar bonds account for one-quarter and short-term treasury bills account for three-quarters. According to the person in charge of the subscription and sales committee, the prospects for subscription and sales in Peiping are very optimistic, with many subscribers within the first two days.</p>

<h3>Xue Du-bi Returns to Beijing and Speaks; Yellow River Treatment Project to be Completed by Mid-July; 67 Billion Spent on Closing the Breach</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Du-bi and his party returned to Beijing on the morning of the 11th and will report to the Chairman on the inspection of the flooded area. When reporters interviewed Xue, asking him to discuss the inspection situation, he said: Regarding the Yellow River breach closure project, the closure project has been completed, and the current project is to raise the height of the embankment, which is being carried out by tens of thousands of workers daily and is expected to be completed by the end of May. The embankment repair project can be completed by mid-July, and the Yellow River treatment project will come to an end. The fundamental treatment plan had a planning organization last year and is being researched and formulated. Regarding the reorganization of the flooded area, six survey teams have been sent to conduct a comprehensive survey of the entire flooded area, followed by the reorganization of the river course. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) has also drafted a "Revival Zone" plan for the reorganization of the flooded area, which will be designed and implemented jointly by various institutions such as the Water Conservancy, Land Administration, and ERRRA. Xue said that the total expenditure for this breach closure project was 67 billion. Xue said that refugees seen on this trip include flood victims returning from the flooded area and refugees fleeing from the Communist-controlled area. They have no clothes, no food, and no shelter, which is extremely tragic. Fortunately, the ERRRA's sub-office in Henan has set up refugee relief funds, congee kitchens, orphanages, work-study schools, and factories everywhere, so that refugees can return and have a place to rely on. The factories are especially well-coordinated by taking local materials to make what is needed. However, the most important thing at present is the stability of order, which still requires a solution to political problems.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Xue Du-bi told reporters that according to the conversations with refugees who fled from the Communist-controlled areas of Puyang County and other places in the flooded area, he learned that the Communist army regards people's lives as if they were grass. Every county holds meetings and takes struggle actions, brutally killing the people. There is a cruel torture called the "Chiang Kai-shek pole," which involves tying the "struggled against" person to the top of a tenon, then cutting the rope, causing them to fall from the air into a pre-set forest of knives or sharpened wooden poles. The horrific death is appalling.</p>

Yin stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently felt a deep lack of talent proficient in foreign languages, especially Russian language talent. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously requested the Examination Committee to handle special high and general examinations to select talent proficient in Russian language. The Examination Committee has approved the measures and will hold them in June in Beijing, Peiping, and Shenyang.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Closely Watching the Development of the Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>After the Japanese elections in April, the new constitution will be officially implemented starting May 3rd. The "Constitution of the Empire of Japan," promulgated in Meiji 22 (1889), will have ended its 58-year life. According to custom, the current cabinet should resign within 30 days after the general election. In accordance with Articles 67 and 68 of the new constitution, the Prime Minister should be elected by the Diet. The first Diet session after the general election is scheduled to convene on May 20th, and Emperor Hirohito has ordered Yoshida to convene the Diet on the 28th. Therefore, this two-and-a-half-week period is a time of intense political upheaval in Japan, and all changes and developments depend on this stage. So far, the most notable developments in the Japanese political situation are: first, the purge of Finance Minister Ishibashi, which dealt a major blow to the Liberal Party; second, the activity of the Socialist Party, hoping that the Diet will decide to appoint a prime minister from their party; and third, the growing consensus among the Liberal, Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties regarding the formation of a unified national cabinet. These developments are all new factors that will determine Japan's future political situation and are worthy of our close attention.</p>
<p>We had predicted that the conservative forces would gain an overwhelming advantage in the Japanese elections in April. The growth of conservative forces is not only unfortunate for Japanese democratic politics but also a disaster for future Asian peace. As expected, the victory of conservative forces in the local administrative head elections in Japan has become a foregone conclusion, and the elections of the central Diet and local assemblies also reflect the Japanese public opinion that Japanese politics is still actively leaning towards conservatism. The results of the election for 150 members of the House of Councillors on April 20th are as follows: Liberal Party, 32 seats; Socialist Party, 29 seats; Democratic Party, 24 seats; National Cooperative Party, 6 seats; minor parties, 5 seats; Communist Party, 1 seat; independents, 53 seats. In summary, conservative forces hold 109 seats, the left wing holds 30 seats, and the centrists hold 11 seats. The results of the election for 466 members of the House of Representatives on April 25th are as follows: Socialist Party, 143 seats; Liberal Party, 133 seats; Democratic Party, 126 seats; National Cooperative Party, 31 seats; minor parties, 16 seats; Communist Party, 4 seats; independents, 13 seats. In summary, the socialists have emerged as the largest party, holding the most seats in the lower house. The Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Yoshida, lost the most seats in the lower house, and the Democratic Party, led by Shidehara, ranks third. The parties representing conservative forces have slightly declined, but the combined seats of the Liberal and Democratic parties, which share the same lineage, still outweigh those of the Socialist Party. The fixed number of members for the national local assemblies is 2,495. The election results announced on April 30th covered 2,484 members, including 517 from the Democratic Party, 469 from the Liberal Party, 414 from the Socialist Party, 133 from the National Cooperative Party, 177 from minor parties, 3 from the Communist Party, and 771 independents. If divided into left and conservative, the conservative parties hold 1,622 seats, while the left wing holds only 562 seats. Clearly, the Japanese public opinion institutions, from the central to the local level, are dominated by conservative forces, and the future political trend is very clear.</p>
<p>Given the overall trend of the elections, who will be responsible for forming the cabinet after the opening of the new Diet? Will it be led by the Socialist Party, or will a coalition government be formed by three or four parties? The trends can be observed before the opening of the Diet, and decisions can be made after the opening of the Diet. After the announcement of the House of Representatives members, the parties remained silent, but the Socialist Party held frequent meetings and discussions, deciding that "our party deeply feels the great responsibility of being the largest party after the general election and is willing to devote all efforts to realizing a national political system." They advocated that after Yoshida submits his resignation on May 6th, the party chairman, Katayama Tetsu, should lead the cabinet formation movement. The left wing of the party insisted that Katayama should serve as the future prime minister and recruit other parties to form a coalition government. The right wing of the party recognized the strength of the conservative forces and the possibility of regaining leadership in the Diet, and even the possibility that Yoshida might use "purge" orders to remove the seats of the Socialist Party. Therefore, they strongly advocated that Socialist Party members do not need to serve as prime minister in the future coalition government, but only request to head the four ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Forestry, Labor (not yet established), and Economic Stabilization. Yoshida of the Liberal Party stated that he would never cling to the position of prime minister, but on the 6th, he delayed the date of his resignation, apparently with other plans. Shidehara's attitude was "inaction," and key members of the Democratic Party generally opposed Katayama serving as prime minister, with even Ashida Hitoshi believing that Katayama's appointment as prime minister was impossible. The party conflicts among the Japanese are fierce, but their spirit of unity in "loyalty to the emperor and love for the country" can be above everything else in today's situation. Therefore, the contradiction of their party interests may change from opposition to unity. On May 3rd, the day the new constitution was implemented, all parties unanimously appealed to remember the difficulties of the times and demanded to jointly create a new Japan, filled with the spirit of perseverance and determination to rise again when facing a cliff. From this point of view, we predict that the evolution of the Japanese political situation will recover to stability after a short period of intense upheaval.</p>
<p>Some people predict that the current Japanese political situation has many contradictions, and conservative forces will definitely prevent the Socialist Party from forming a cabinet. We believe this kind of speculation is wrong. Let's look at the facts: Yoshida should have resigned on the 6th, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Joji announced on the 6th that the resignation would be postponed, and the Socialist Party and other parties did not express any objection. The 20th was the date for the opening of the Diet, but Emperor Hirohito suddenly ordered a postponement, indicating that the Japanese parties and the Japanese regime must obtain out-of-session coordination before the opening of the Diet, so as not to have infighting and struggles in the Diet. On the 8th, Yoshida and Katayama held talks, and on the 9th, the leaders of the four parties held a meeting, and immediately issued a declaration after the meeting: "In view of the importance of the current situation, all parties are willing to abandon their prejudices and realize a four-party coalition cabinet, in order to jointly bear the responsibility of overcoming the difficulties." This declaration is earnest and sincere! The Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and National Cooperative Party are the four major parties in the Japanese political arena today. With the coordination of the heads of the four parties, whether Katayama will serve as the next prime minister, or Yoshida will remain in office, or Shidehara or Ashida will serve as prime minister, are all unimportant questions. The most important thing is that they can quickly abandon their prejudices, compete in the formulation of policies, look at the content of the policies, and then decide on the preferred candidate. The Liberal Party holds this view, and the Socialist Party also advocates the same. Therefore, the Japanese political situation in turmoil is now showing signs of calmness. Due to the coordination of the four parties, which party will lead the formation of the cabinet? Who will serve as prime minister? These are not serious issues in the political situation. Therefore, the future cabinet will definitely be successfully organized as a coalition government without the Communist Party, with each party jointly governing and jointly bearing national responsibility, which is almost certain.</p>
<p>The current stage of Japanese politics can be said to be the beginning of a new era. Although this page of history is new, the characters are still old, the ambitions and aspirations are still old, and there is a lurking kind of terrible undercurrent. Most Japanese people aspire to be Goujian, especially politicians aspire to be Fan Li. This ideological undercurrent is now growing on the Japanese archipelago, and we should be especially vigilant about the Japanese political situation.</p>

<h3>Heated Debate Between US and Soviet Representatives on Future Status of Palestine; Result Submitted to 15-Nation Subcommittee for Review</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] The United Nations today at least temporarily shelved the compromise proposals of the Philippines, Iraq, Colombia, and India, and appointed a new ad hoc committee to break the deadlock on the Palestinian independence issue. When the United States opposed Soviet and Arab demands for the United Nations to draft a plan for immediate Palestinian independence, the dispute was referred back to the subcommittee for discussion. US Representative Johnson told the 55-nation Political Committee that no country opposed Palestine declaring independence at an appropriate time, but the timing issue could only be decided after the Inquiry Committee thoroughly studied the Palestine issue. Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke twice, insisting that the United Nations should immediately promote the independence of Palestine and should not just engage in empty talk. Johnson argued that the United States was not "uncompromising" and was willing to have the Inquiry Committee decide whether to propose that Palestine declare independence at this time. The Inquiry Committee is currently being organized and is expected to submit a report in September. After several compromise proposals and amendments were put forward, the Political Committee canceled the meeting originally scheduled for this afternoon and organized another subcommittee. The new subcommittee includes the previous eleven members of the subcommittee, plus representatives from Iran, India, Colombia, and the Philippines. The 15-nation subcommittee then held a closed meeting and is scheduled to present the results of the discussion to the Political Committee on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The United Nations has been discussing the Palestine issue for two weeks, but the main issue, the future status of the Holy Land, has not yet been resolved. Judging from the opinions of all parties, there are two possible solutions: one is to divide Palestine into two states, Jewish and Arab, and the other is to entrust the Holy Land to a United Nations agency for five years. Opinions within the Jewish community are also not unified. It is reported that some Zionists support partition, but on the condition that the land obtained by the Jewish and Arab states should be equal. Another faction believes that once partition is accepted, it will be impossible to reverse it, so they oppose quickly accepting the partition proposal and prefer to entrust it to the United Nations first. Rabbi Silver, chairman of the Zionist Organization of America, also believes that it is not advisable to establish a Jewish state until a sufficient number of Jews have immigrated to obtain a majority of the population. Currently, there are only about 600,000 Jews in the Holy Land, while there are more than one million Arabs. As for the Arab countries, they demand immediate independence in order to maintain their majority advantage.</p>
<h3>Documents Suddenly Released Amidst UN General Assembly Meeting Proving Huseini Conspired with Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] Several copied archives were released here today, proving the process of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini, colluding with the Axis powers. Among them is a letter from Huseini to Himmler, the leader of the German political police, regarding their plan to jointly reduce the Jewish population. At the same time, Nazi documents seized from the Japanese and Italian embassies and Huseini's private files also revealed that the Arab leader had spread Axis propaganda to Muslims from Morocco to Indonesia and planned to organize an Arab army to assist the Nazi army in combat.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 11th] The vice-chairman of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee, Huseini, is scheduled to fly to Cairo today to meet with the chairman of the committee, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini. The talks will likely be related to the developments of the UN General Assembly meeting. It is said that Vice-Chairman Huseini will personally go to New York to attend the United Nations meeting.</p>
<h3>US Promoting New Plan to Modify Lend-Lease Act in Peacetime Enabling European and Asian Democracies to Achieve Economic Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The US government is now attempting to shift the focus of the "Truman Doctrine" from the theory of the anti-communist crusade to economic measures to rebuild Western Europe and the democracies of the Far East. Officials believe that the "Truman Doctrine" is America's world policy, and they will make this plan a peacetime Lend-Lease Act measure. Truman's current concern is how to prevent economic collapse in Western Europe and the Far East. Senior officials firmly believe that the most important way to reduce the communist forces in Western Europe and the Far East is to enable the countries there to be economically self-reliant. Undersecretary of State Acheson recently gave a speech in Cleveland, calling for the immediate revival of the economies of Germany and Japan and calling for certain economic measures, such as extending the wartime export control law. This speech was the first step in starting this transformation movement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Walter Lippmann, a Washington Post reporter who is often seen as reflecting the views of the State Department, predicted that the US government will have to restore some form of lend-lease system within the next twelve months. Lippmann said that the living standards in Europe may collapse across the board. In the coming months, at most twelve months, the United States will have to restore some form of lend-lease system, which will require at least $5 billion annually, and this lend-lease aid will inevitably have to continue for several years. Lippmann believes that Undersecretary of State Acheson's speech in Cleveland two days ago was the first step in announcing this plan to the American public. Acheson's words confirmed the belief of those in charge here that the world will soon face a general shortage of US dollars, and officials also believe that unless a foreign aid plan that is broader than the aid to Greece, Turkey, and Korea is implemented, many countries will inevitably feel an unprecedented shortage due to the lack of US dollars. It is reported that the countries currently lacking US dollars not only include Britain and France, but also countries such as Sweden and Mexico, which have always been seen as prosperous, are also facing the same crisis. Currently, many countries have already spent all their money to buy goods, and the US federal gold reserves recently increased by $150 million in one week. Therefore, only the United States can provide assistance to other countries.</p>
<h3>Truman Doctrine Coincides with Hoover's Recommendations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to today's news, former President Hoover, about 28 years ago, when he was serving as Director of Relief in Europe, proposed a plan very similar to the "Truman Doctrine." Hoover suggested that the United States use all possible means to help Europe overcome post-war economic difficulties, but he put forward the following conditions: that the United States "must insist that any country that is not determined to stabilize its domestic financial and political situation cannot be given assistance." The discovery of this recommendation was due to the State Department publishing its tenth volume of documents on the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>Greek Foreign Minister Praises US Aid Plan</h3>
<p>Amnesty Measures Being Negotiated with the US</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 10th] Regarding US aid to Greece, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris commented, "It is inappropriate to call it 'relief' or 'aid.' In fact, it is an extension of the Lend-Lease Act, and its purpose is to make democratic principles triumph among the United Nations, especially among the countries that suffered heavy losses during the war. Greece has now become a very important air base, and this alone is enough to make the United States concerned about Greece reasonable. In addition, there is also a strategic issue. The last war has proven the unreliability of defensive positions, but Greece will surely become a powerful vanguard for directly penetrating the iron heart of the Middle East."</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 11th] The Greek government "generally" agreed to the US proposal for international supervision of amnesty in order to attract an estimated 15,000 guerrillas in the mountains to return. However, a condition was put forward in a note to US Ambassador to Greece MacVeagh, namely, that the UN-supervised amnesty method recommended by the Balkan Inquiry Committee must be cancelled. MacVeagh asked the United States to clarify its proposal as merely a "pure amnesty." It is expected that the US reply will be submitted early next week. It is reported that although the US proposal is only a suggestion, it contains a threat that the US will terminate aid to Greece to support the US proposal.</p>
<h3>Molotov Accepts US Conditions; US Determination to Aid Korea Unchanged; If All of Korea is Unified, Aid will be Extended to the Entire Territory</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Although US officials welcomed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's acceptance of the US conditions for reopening the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea, they considered it not entirely unexpected. They believe that the Soviet Union's agreement to the US conditions for the meeting is the ultimate result of the US's tough stance on the Korean issue. The only question is when will this be realized. The US assumes that the Soviet Union's willingness to do so will be conditional on the situation in their northern occupied zone. However, Molotov's acceptance of the US conditions is not enough to change the US's determination to provide massive economic aid to Korea. If Korea has been unified when this aid is implemented, it will be extended to the entire territory. Molotov's refusal to allow all political groups in Korea to freely express their opinions according to the proposal in Marshall's letter of May 2 and acceptance of the most generous conditions ever allowed by the United States is seen as his clever choice.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Releases Report on Occupation of South Korea</h3>
<p>US Doing Everything Possible to Promote Korean Independence</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] MacArthur released the US military's report on the occupation of southern Korea for February today, stating that the US military authorities there have appointed more Koreans to important government positions in preparation for the country's complete autonomy in the future. The Koreans' opposition to trusteeship is very strong, and they long for independence as soon as possible. US military commander Hodge expressed great sympathy for this and stated that the United States is doing everything possible to promote it. The US military authorities have repeatedly stated that they will do their best to enable Koreans to freely preside over all departments of their government. The US military government has thoroughly discussed issues such as agriculture, forestry, finance, industry, commerce, government reorganization, and election law with the Koreans. Production in southern Korea has greatly improved.</p>

<h3>Undercurrents Lurking in Japanese Political Situation; Conservative Factions Striving; New Cabinet Policies Will Cause Disputes</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The Bihara faction of the Democratic Party believes that if a common front of conservative elements from all parties is possible, then the Democratic Party should serve as prime minister. The new faction of the party also believes that the issue of the prime minister should not be decided separately from the issue of the ratio of cabinet posts. Therefore, the result of the four-party secretary-general meeting on the 12th will be that the conservative elements will seize the initiative, and they will decide their attitude after the Socialist Party puts forward a plan to deal with the political situation, including the ratio of cabinet posts.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] Regarding the issue of the Socialist Party forming a cabinet, although a coalition cabinet was unanimously approved at the four-party representative meeting on the 9th, the basic knot seems to still exist in the struggle between conservative forces and socialist forces, that is, the future of Japanese politics tending to the left or the right. Although the four-party secretary-general meeting has been scheduled for the 12th, such basic issues cannot be decided by a few meetings. Currently, the parties are mostly adopting a reserved attitude on issues such as policies, the choice of prime minister, and the ratio of cabinet posts. For example, regarding policies, the Liberal Party will still base itself on its original policies. In addition, the National Cooperative Party still insists on: (1) advocating the enactment of the Agricultural Cooperative Association Law based on the democratization of the rural economy; (2) the new yen issue should be legalized at the four-party meeting; (3) opposing state ownership of important enterprises; and (4) establishing an elementary school system for workers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Onboard the HMS Vanguard, 10th] Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret visited the engine room and steering room of this ship today. Both of them personally steered the ship.

<h3>Britain's High Debt; Bevin's Confidence Remains Strong</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in his Woolwich constituency today, "When I returned from Moscow and passed through Berlin, I saw that the city was still in ruins two years after the end of the war. Therefore, I don't feel complacent about victory, but rather feel that the people who caused the war suffered the most tragic consequences. I sincerely hope to preserve all the remaining things and the essence of humanity in order to prevent war from breaking out again. We have now mortgaged almost everything we have and sold everything off, leaving us destitute. We now have a domestic debt of 2.5 billion pounds and a foreign debt of nearly 3 billion pounds, but we are not discouraged by this. On the contrary, we feel that we should still be a great leader in the world, morally leading the world, so as to contribute to the progress of mankind."</p>
<h3>British Cabinet to Hold Meeting: Thorough Examination of Indian Situation; Governor-General to Announce Political Transfer Plan on Schedule</h3>

The British Cabinet will hold a comprehensive discussion on the Indian situation on Monday or Tuesday, so that Lord Ismay can convey the British Cabinet's response to the report submitted by the Governor-General to Mountbatten.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Simla, May 10th] It was announced here today: Governor-General Lord Mountbatten is scheduled to inform Indian leaders of the plan to transfer power to India in New Delhi on the 17th of this month. The statement said that the Governor-General has invited representatives from the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Sikhs to meet with him in New Delhi on the morning of May 17th to present them with the British government's plan for the transfer of power to India. The Indian leaders invited to meet with the Governor-General include Nehru, Vice President of the Indian Interim Government, Jinnah, President of the Muslim League, and Singh, Sikh leader and Minister of Defense of the Indian Interim Government. In addition, the Governor-General has invited representatives of the Indian princely states who participated in the negotiations on the issue of the states joining the Constituent Assembly to meet with him on the afternoon of May 17th.</p>
<h3>Muslim League Considers: Changing Attitude</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, May 11th] It has been learned that the Muslim League has agreed to reconsider its decision to take direct action made in July 1946.

<h3>After Touring South Africa for Three Months: British King Returns</h3>

<h3>Exchange of Notes Between Britain and Siam: Does Not Involve Land Issues</h3>
<p>Former Siamese Prime Minister Arrives in Washington for Discussions</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, May 10th] Authoritative sources here stated that the exchange of notes between Britain and Siam in Bangkok only involves enemy property in Siam and the return of Allied property by Siam, and does not involve land issues. The exchanged notes are actually a supplement to the peace agreement signed between Britain and Siam on January 1, 1946, which stipulates that Siam declares any land taken from Britain by Siam after December 7, 1941, to be invalid. The contents of the recent exchange of notes include: (1) Siam should hand over Japanese property and other enemy property within its borders to the Allies for disposal; (2) Siam should return the property rights and interests of countries that declared war on Siam in Siam; (3) Siam should provide adequate currency as the maintenance fee for British troops in Siam.</p>

Mr. Bidyaphorn indicated that he will stay for about a week to engage in consultations.</p>

<h3>France and Vietnam Explore Peace: Gradually Entering Concrete Stage</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, May 10th] Peace explorations between the French and Viet Minh sides have been underway here and outside Vietnam for three weeks. It is expected that after Vietnamese Governor Bollaert arrives in Hanoi on Wednesday, this peace exploration work will become more concrete. Reliable sources said that a letter containing the Viet Minh government's peace proposals has been delivered to Mousse, Bollaert's personal representative in Hanoi. After Mr. Bollaert arrives in Hanoi, he will stay for three days, during which he will deliver a public speech, the content of which will be of great importance to the Vietnamese political situation. Mr. Bollaert is scheduled to leave Vietnam for Paris on May 26th and will not be able to return to Vietnam until mid-June. The final solution to the Vietnamese situation will have to wait until Mr. Bollaert returns to Vietnam from France.</p>
<p>Viet Minh's New Party Quite Active</p>
<p>At the same time, as preliminary negotiations become increasingly tense, several small Vietnamese parties have united to form a new party called the "All-Vietnam Alliance National Front" in order to negotiate with the French authorities. The party issued a declaration today, claiming that former Annam King Bao Dai is the leader of the new party, and stated that they have made contact with official intermediaries. The party's goal is the same as that of the party led by Ho Chi Minh, which is to unify and make the Viet Minh independent within the French Federation, but the new party denounces Ho Chi Minh's government as a communist and totalitarian regime, and therefore expresses its opposition.</p>
<h3>Madagascar Uprising: French Cabinet Resolves to Dissolve "Renovation Movement"</h3>
<p>Malagasy Natives Launch Large-Scale Attacks, Fail</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Nazi Invasion History: Inner Story of Hess's Flight to England; Attempted to Persuade Britain to Accept Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, May 10th] The US Army Department's massive eight-volume history of Nazi aggression was published today, revealing in detail the inside story of Hitler's Deputy Führer Hess's flight to England. After Hess arrived in England, he suggested to the Duke of Hamilton that he guarantee the territories of the British Empire in exchange for Britain's recognition of Germany's control over Europe. Hess also stated that Germany had no ambitions for the Americas and that the so-called German threat was nothing more than a fantasy, and Hitler's interests were limited to Europe. Hess also said that if Britain accepted peace, the United States would definitely be angry, because the United States' real intention was to inherit the British Empire. Hess suggested that Britain could have complete freedom of action within its empire, but Germany's former colonies should be returned to Germany. The Duke of Hamilton also said that when he discussed Germany's peace proposals with Hess, he also talked about the Irish issue. Hess said that he had never mentioned the Irish issue when talking to Hitler, and Ireland was irrelevant to Germany in this war, so he expected Hitler would not consider Anglo-Irish relations. The Nazi invasion history also revealed that the Nazi Air Force may have already been conducting high-altitude reconnaissance of the London area as early as 1939 or even 1938.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Returns to Shanghai After Seeking Instructions in Nanjing: Reaffirms Resolution to Stabilize Society; Points Out That Rationing Based on Headcount Can Be Implemented This Month After the Thaw; Those Who Take the Opportunity to Cause Trouble Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai yesterday morning by overnight express train from Nanjing and attended a banquet hosted by Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang for the city's press at noon. During the banquet, Wu reported on his trip to Nanjing to seek instructions from the central authorities on policies to deal with the city's commodity prices and stabilize social order.</p>
<p>Wu first stated: The first thing that the four million citizens of the city need now is stability. However, the unstable phenomenon that occurred in May of the lunar year has reappeared. Unreasonable and unlawful actions are occurring from time to time, causing widespread instability throughout the city. Democracy should be based on abiding by the law. If one does not abide by the law, then how can one achieve democracy? How can one talk about democracy when one shouts democracy but exceeds the law? Democratic countries also have sanctions against the people, but they are sanctioned by law. Now that Shanghai's martial law has not been lifted, the government is determined to stabilize social order. In the future, those who are unreasonable, unlawful, and disrupt social order and peace will be severely dealt with according to the law. Those whose circumstances are serious will be handed over to military law according to the martial law, this is one.</p>
<p>Secondly, the central and local governments are determined to do their best to find solutions to the problems of rising prices and people's livelihoods. In the commodity price conference yesterday, a decision was made on the method of unfreezing and adjusting the workers' living index. It is stipulated that those with a base salary of less than 30 yuan will be paid according to the index, and those with a base salary of more than 30 yuan will be discounted at each level. This decision does not need to be approved by the Executive Yuan. Starting this month, workers' salaries can be implemented according to this method. Currently, the base salary of general workers in Shanghai is much higher than before the war. If all base salaries are paid according to the index, then factories will not be able to bear the burden and the entire industry will be in total collapse. On the one hand, the government is protecting the lives of workers, and on the other hand, it is considering the burden on factories, so it decided on this method. Otherwise, factories will be forced to close down due to the inability to bear the burden, and all workers will be unemployed, which will make the problem even more serious. Therefore, those who shout for unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index today are not friends of the workers, but enemies of the workers. If there are other backgrounds that want to use the wage issue to create instability in Shanghai, then they are enemies of all the citizens of Shanghai. We should know that the current economic crisis is extremely serious, and both labor and management and all parties must make mutual sacrifices and concessions to overcome this difficult situation. Regarding the rice issue, the government authorities have given careful consideration. On the one hand, it requires low rice prices so that social life is not affected, and on the other hand, it fears that rice prices will be too low, causing the adverse effect of "cheap grain hurting farmers." Since the rice rush occurred, the municipal government has released 170,000 bags of rice to date. Because the allocated price is too low, 12 rice shops have had accidents due to citizens crowding and rushing to buy. Only five or six of them are serious. There are more than 2,000 rice shops in Shanghai. Now, those who have had accidents in the rice rush are still less than 1%, which does not seem to be too serious. In order to avoid crowding in the allocation and sale of rice in each rice shop, the government has decided to improve the allocation and sale method. Workers in factories, public and church personnel, and boarding students in schools will all be directly allocated rice by the municipal government. For the poor, the government will set up distribution stores and allocate rice based on headcount. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau is still staying in Nanjing, continuing to discuss the detailed methods of allocating and selling rice with the relevant authorities. It is expected that he can return to Shanghai by overnight train today (that is, the 11th). This method can be implemented in the city next week.</p>
<p>Finally, what must be solemnly stated is that the government is determined to maintain social order and stability, and to strictly enforce the rule of law. From today onwards, those who take the opportunity to cause trouble for the normal business of legitimate grain merchants will be severely dealt with. Rice merchants who beat people will also be strictly punished according to the law. As for the rice market, in addition to the North Market, which has already resumed business yesterday, I will convene the person in charge of the South Market for a talk tomorrow morning and send military police to protect it. The resumption of business tomorrow (the 12th) should also be no problem.</p>

<h3>Dong Xian Guang Receives Press Circle: Hope for Assistance to Government to Stabilize Hearts of the People; Assistance Promised for Difficulties of Press Circle</h3>
<p>Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang and Deputy Director Deng You De arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing one after another the night before last. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted a reception for the city's press circle at the International Hotel for the first time. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan were invited to participate, with a total of more than 60 people attending. Dong said in his speech: I have not yet formally assumed the position of Director of the Information Bureau, and the Information Bureau has not yet been formally established. The tasks of the Information Bureau are now on my shoulders and those of the two deputy directors. Given the occurrence of the rice rush and the seriousness of other situations, I urgently wanted to come to Shanghai to meet with you all. I am very happy to have this opportunity to meet with my colleagues and old friends today. In the future, please give more assistance to the government's administrative measures, especially in stabilizing people's hearts. Before the implementation of constitutional government, the power of newspapers is extremely great, and there are also many people who rely on the leadership of public opinion. At this time of fluctuating public sentiment, I deeply hope that when you write news comments and produce headlines, you will strive to be careful and avoid stimulation, so that the psychology of the people can be relatively stable. To give an example, such as the rice problem, due to the people's anxiety, those who have rice are unwilling to sell it, and those who have no rice are rushing to buy and store it. In such a situation, no matter how much rice there is, it will never be enough. Similar situations require the assistance of the press to stabilize people's hearts. The central and local governments are now determined to gradually seek solutions to various issues that are closely related to the people. Please give more assistance from the public opinion circle, and I hope you will give more guidance to the Information Bureau. If the press circle has any difficulties, I will also do my best to help solve them. Please also help the Information Bureau with the same effort.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu announced the measures taken to seek instructions in Nanjing to deal with the city's commodity prices and stabilize social order (see above), people from the press circle successively expressed their opinions, and Director Dong and Mayor Wu responded separately.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Expresses Four Points of Opinion</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Gongzhan contributed four points of opinion to the government authorities for stabilizing social order: (1) The current phenomenon in Shanghai of not talking about law but talking about force, if allowed to continue, will mean that Shanghai has no future, the entire country has no future, and it will fall into an irreversible situation. Since the mayor is determined to stabilize the community, he should immediately, under the guidance of the central government, work with the garrison headquarters to stop all illegal actions and deal with them according to the law. This measure will definitely be supported by the city's citizens. Recently, the demonstrations and petitions of the masses have hindered public transportation and social order, which is inappropriate. Any matter should be based on right and wrong. Today, right and wrong are not discussed, but only the number of people is used to compare strength. How can social order be stabilized if this is the case? Therefore, this point must be corrected. (2) All government measures should be considered from a broad perspective and should not add any more unstable factors. Before formulating laws and regulations, the central government must first carefully discuss them with the local authorities to avoid difficulties in implementation. (3) It is hoped that commodity prices will not continue to rise, and it is hoped that the central government will immediately decide on a method to stabilize commodity prices. However, before the method is decided, please ask the central government officials to say less. Because Shanghai is a speculative market, every word and deed of the central government officials can be used or misinterpreted by speculative merchants as good material for raising prices and stimulating the market. The index method decided by the commodity price conference is extremely reasonable, but it must be strongly implemented by the government and unanimously supported by people from all walks of life, and fully cooperated with the government to be smoothly promoted. Finally, Pan asked Mayor Wu to pay attention to the issue of "poor people" being allocated rice and should be specially and carefully considered with the Social Affairs Bureau, the scope of the so-called "poor people," so as to avoid disputes due to inconsistent standards.</p>
<p>Cheng Cangbo then spoke, requesting that the government's responsible authorities stabilize the press circle itself before seeking social stability. Deng Jixing of Xin Min Pao and Wang Jihua of Lianhe Wan Bao expressed sympathy for Cheng's call.</p>
<p>Technical Difficulties Should Be Understood</p>
<p>Hu Jianzhong spoke, in principle accepting Director Dong's statement to avoid publishing news with stimulating factors, but asked for understanding of the difficulties of news workers in technically handling news, inevitably there will be too much or too little. However, even if there is improper handling in technique, the motive is pure and without other intentions and should be understood. Finally, Cao Gubing, Li Zikuan, Zhang Cangping and others expressed their opinions separately. Cao Gubing expressed sincere gratitude to Director Dong for being willing to help the press circle solve difficulties. Li Zikuan asked the responsible authorities to pay attention to solving the problem of newspaper supply.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Sign Contract for Allocated Housing: Mayor Responsible for Negotiation</h3>
<p>Zhang Cangping stated that for public and church personnel allocated housing, the stipulated unified rental period has expired. Although the Executive Yuan has clearly stipulated that existing tenants can negotiate with landlords to sign a lease and continue to live, most landlords and rental agents are unwilling to continue signing contracts with existing tenants in order to profit from high renewal fees and are trying to take back the houses to rent them out again. As a result, tens of thousands of public and church personnel living in allocated housing in the city will be homeless, which is a serious social problem, and asked Mayor Wu to properly resolve it under the principle of "stabilizing social order." Mayor Wu said that he had invited various property owners to talk a few days ago, hoping to negotiate leases with existing tenants. Most of the property owners agreed, only hoping to appropriately adjust the rent. If tenants currently living in allocated housing are rejected when negotiating a lease with the landlord, they can report to me, and I will be responsible for negotiating on their behalf. The reception ended at around 2:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Traffic Fully Restored</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The students from National Yingshi University who were petitioning and stranded in Hangzhou, following the advice of Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, had already withdrawn from the railway line the night before last and temporarily resided in Hangzhou. Shanghai-Hangzhou line traffic was completely restored. Train No. 27, which departed from Shanghai, arrived in Hangzhou at 4:45 am yesterday. Other trains departed as usual. Train No. 302, which departed from Hangzhou for Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai at 7:40 am yesterday morning. Due to the large number of passengers who had been blocked on their way to Hangzhou in recent days, the two railway bureaus specially added a reserved seat train at 5:30 pm yesterday.</p>
<h3>Reclaiming the Racecourse: A Citizen Suggests Participating in the Conference; Issuing Lottery Bonds; Repaying Principal with Added Interest</h3>
<p>The third conference of the city's Senate will be held this month, and the issue of reclaiming the racecourse will be hotly discussed again. The council recently learned that a citizen named Leng Qing suggested in his procurement plan for buying back the property rights of the Shanghai Racecourse, vaguely stating: It is appropriate to follow the pre-war aviation lottery method, issuing a lottery bond to purchase the property rights of the Shanghai Racecourse, that is, using its income storage for the needs of purchase, at the beginning of the implementation, the relevant authorities should invite the Jockey Club, the Sports Federation, local impartial people, and land experts, etc. to carefully deliberate on the existing land area of the racecourse and its above-ground buildings, seeking a fair and accurate estimate as a basis, however, this bond its nature should be different from the aviation lottery method, adopting the policy of repaying the principal with added interest. After a certain number of years, it can repay the principal with added interest according to the general bank deposit interest rate. If so, the lottery winners are of course fortunate, and those who do not win also do not lose the guarantee on their investment. In order to be reasonable, the municipal government and local business community people should jointly organize a lottery bond fund management committee to purchase racecourse property rights, responsible for the safekeeping. In addition, six concrete methods are suggested and submitted to the conference for a public resolution.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Employees' Attitude is Firm: Salary Issue to be Continued Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio Station employees, demanding equal treatment with the Post and Telegraph Bureau, have refused to accept commercial telegrams since the morning before yesterday. Yesterday, they continued to "work on empty stomachs." At 10:00 am, the telecommunications bureau employees convened a general assembly and decided: (1) to continue to demand the principle of relief funds; (2) to resolve to take unified action with colleagues at the International Radio Station, and to send three representatives to immediately form a joint association with three representatives from the International Radio Station, responsible for conducting negotiations with the bureau and Taiwan sides; (3) in principle, to agree to invite representatives from various bureaus across the country to come to Shanghai to establish a nationwide organization. At 4:00 pm, the joint association hosted reporters at the Coastal Radio Station, reporting on the low salaries and difficult living conditions of the bureau and Taiwan employees.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Deputy Director Jiang of the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 5:00 pm yesterday and immediately convened six representatives of the joint association for consultation at the private residence of the Telecommunications Bureau Director Yu Bingjian. Negotiations continued until 12:00 am, but no solution was reached. Negotiations will continue today.</p>

<h3>Granting Loans of 70 Billion: Resuming Our Coastal Fisheries</h3>
<p>Our country's coastal fishermen suffered extremely heavy losses during the war. Previously, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Agricultural Bank of China held a meeting to discuss and formulate a special project for restoring our fishing industry. A nationwide guidance organization for fishermen will be established, with the headquarters to be located in Shanghai and branches throughout the country's major fish production areas. The main purpose is to use the 35,000-ton material for repairing fishing boats supplied by UNRRA and a large number of fishing nets and fishing gear as a revival. It is estimated that this material may be used to build 5,000 new fishing boats and repair 3,500 fishing boats. The Agricultural Bank will provide loans of 70 billion yuan for transportation and construction costs.</p>
<h3>After the New Ying Ping Ran Aground, It Sailed to Qingdao and Encountered Danger Again, Was Seriously Damaged and Ran Aground on Bawang Beach, All Passengers and Crew Have Disembarked</h3>
<p>The "New Ying Ping" ship of the Tongfu Shipping Line, on the morning of the 8th, loaded over 3,000 tons of materials from the Relief Administration in Shanghai, and sailed to Huludao, Yingkou and other ports. While sailing to the Shandong Peninsula, it hit Erjiao Reef (transliteration). After all the crew members tried to find a way, they attempted to sail back to the nearest location, Qingdao, and urgently sent an "SOS" to seek help from all parties. The Hubei ship passing by the area, as well as US naval vessels from Qingdao and nearby Japanese ships, rushed to rescue. According to the latest telegram: After the ship ran aground, it planned to sail to Qingdao, but due to serious damage to some parts, it ran aground on Bawang Beach near the coast. Most of the passengers and crew have disembarked on the nearby coast. Currently, Tongfu Shipping Line is working with the Shanghai agent of London insurer, Mr. Lao Yi, to contact all parties for assistance.</p>

<h3>Our Merchant Ships Are Poorly Equipped, Drivers Cannot Remain Silent, Hoping the Government Will Improve to Avoid Being Ridiculed by Friendly Nations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchant Marine Drivers Association hosted reporters at 4 pm yesterday. The chairman of the association, Jin Yueshi, reported that because our country's merchant ships are poorly equipped, the chances of accidents are higher, and the sacrifices after accidents are also heavy. The general public does not understand the truth and often accuses the drivers of not fulfilling their responsibilities, not knowing that the equipment on our country's merchant ships does not meet the standards. For example, a ship carrying 300 people only has life-saving equipment for 100 people. How can there not be a scramble for life when encountering danger, leading to tragedy? Furthermore, many of the passenger ships now are converted from cargo ships. Our country signed the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea in 1922. Recently, the UK invited our country to participate in revising the International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea. If we do not strive to improve, wouldn't we be ridiculed by friendly nations and treat human lives as a joke? We appeal for the following: (1) The Legislative Yuan should formulate regulations on passenger ships as soon as possible. (2) The Control Yuan should impeach the navigation administration agencies that do not meet the standards. (3) Please ask the government to clearly stipulate who has the right to obtain life jackets and board lifeboats first in the event of danger. (4) The government should clearly stipulate the highest standards for domestic life jackets and boats, and their detailed terms. (5) Each time a ship sails, the navigation administration agency should send personnel to inspect the actual conditions of passengers and cargo together with the captain. Finally, we should declare to the society that the crew cannot be held responsible for any consequences arising from non-standard life-saving and fire-fighting equipment. A copy of the British ship life-saving equipment standards was distributed as a reference for our country to formulate standards in the future.</p>
<h3>Murder Case of a Chef in Shanghai Middle School, the Murderer Was Escorted to Shanghai from Anhui</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the morning of April 8th, at around 6:00 AM, a male corpse was found strangled in the river in front of the Shanghai Middle School gate on Humin Road, South Shanghai.

Details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that Xu, the head of the branch, ordered Lin Deming, the head of the criminal division, to lead police officers to Hefei, Anhui for a two-week investigation. Finally, Lu Shoulu was captured in the Feifengchi Bathhouse in Dongmiao Street. After interrogation, it was confirmed that Lu was the murderer. He was escorted to Shanghai a few days ago and brought to justice. The other Zhao surname is still being pursued.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Law School Graduates Go to Hangzhou to Welcome Acting President Chu</h3>
<p>Students of the Shanghai Law School were very pleased to learn that the conflict with the police had been resolved satisfactorily.

<h3>A Murder Case Occurred Over a Bowl of Meat</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Chengshan, a 25-year-old Muslim from Shandong, and Xu Jiaoxin, a close friend who studied at the same school in the past, jointly opened the Xiesheng Stationery Store at No. 1903, Duolun Road, North Sichuan Road. Both of them lived in the store. One day during a meal, there was pork in the dishes. Xu persuaded Yang not to follow religious rules and eat meat. Because of this trivial matter, the relationship between the two broke down. Soon Yang withdrew his shares and lived in a warehouse on Lan Road. After Yang left, Xu also regretted it and had no intention of operating alone. He transferred the store to his brother Xu Chengshou, and left Shanghai to work in a bank in Fujian. Yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM, Yang passed by the store and saw that the business was very good, which greatly stimulated him. He went directly to the beef stall opposite the store, grabbed a sharp knife, broke into the stationery store, and slashed Xu Chengshou's head, arms, and buttocks five times, causing serious injuries. Lin Guoding, the owner of the Taili Western Clothing Store next door, heard the noise and rushed over, immediately hugged the murderer, and took away the sharp knife. At the same time, the police also arrived. The injured person was immediately sent to the hospital, and the murderer was taken to the police station. After interrogation, the above situation was learned, and he was detained pending transfer to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Administrative Court Is an Independent Institution, and It Is Still Appropriate to Maintain the Original System. Ma Junshuo Explains Five Reasons</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the implementation of the Constitution and the enactment of the new Judicial Yuan Law, there are various opinions on whether the administrative adjudication agency should be changed, that is, whether the administrative court system should be abolished. The reporter talked with Mr. Ma Junshuo, a famous lawyer in this city, yesterday. He believed that it should not be abolished and that it is still appropriate to maintain the original system. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative litigation is a litigation between the people and government agencies, and its purpose is to sanction illegal actions of government agencies. All government agencies in the country, from local government agencies to the central five yuan, can be defendants in administrative litigation. There should be an independent agency of considerable scale dedicated to handling it. Our country has had administrative adjudication agencies since the Republic of China. If it is abolished after the implementation of the Constitution and merged with ordinary judicial agencies to become a court of the Judicial Yuan, it would lose its original independent and detached position. (2) There is no distinction between administrative law and common law in the United States, so the Supreme Court handles administrative litigation cases concurrently. However, in our country's system, administrative litigation is completely different from civil and criminal litigation. Before filing an administrative lawsuit, administrative reconsideration and further reconsideration procedures must be followed. No lawsuits can be filed with local or high courts. Therefore, if the administrative court is merged with the highest level of ordinary judiciary, it will form a system where the top is combined and the bottom is separated, causing the system to be chaotic and powers to be mixed up. (3) Currently, the administrative court adopts a one-level, one-trial system, while ordinary judicial agencies adopt a three-level, three-trial system. If they are merged, it would be difficult to say that it is appropriate in terms of organization. (4) The current Administrative Court Organization Law stipulates that the Administrative Court is divided into two or three courts, with five judges in each court. When the constitutional era arrives, administrative litigation cases will gradually increase, and there is still a need to expand the organization. If it is abolished, and only one court of the Judicial Yuan is used to handle the administrative litigation cases of the people of the whole country, it may not be possible in reality. (5) To adjudicate administrative litigation cases, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the administrative organization and the implementation of administrative affairs. At the same time, there is no codified administrative law to refer to, and the current administrative laws and regulations are not enough to resolve all administrative disputes. If ordinary judicial officers also serve as administrative adjudication positions, there may also be problems in terms of ability. To sum up, it is still appropriate to maintain the independent institution of the Administrative Court, he said.</p>

<h3>Flight and Weather: Meteorologist Huang Xiaqian Gave a Broadcast Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held the sixth special Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Yuanchang Heming Radio Station, inviting Dr. Huang Xiaqian (pictured), a member of the National Defense Science Committee of the Ministry of National Defense and Director of the Department of Meteorology at the National Central University, to broadcast "Flight and Weather." Excerpts from his speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Last Christmas, three planes crashed in Shanghai, and several other planes crashed afterwards, resulting in significant losses. Even in early spring last year, several planes crashed. Unfortunate aviation events clearly occur more frequently in winter. Everyone is very relieved these days, and aviation can be said to be peaceful. Moreover, not only is it peaceful now, but I can tell you in advance that you can rest assured to take planes for a while. So why are there so many incidents in the aviation industry in winter? I can tell you clearly that this is not what superstitious people call "destiny" or "luck," but due to "weather." With these lessons, we should pay attention to the relationship between weather and flight.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the weather is worst in winter throughout the year. The reason why the most unfortunate events in the aviation industry occur in winter is because of this. The following are some of the harmful factors of winter weather for flying: (1) The weather is cloudy and rainy, and the cloud layer is very low. Sometimes the bottom of the cloud is connected to the top of the mountain, and the plane crashes into the top of the mountain when it flies out of the cloud layer. General Dai Zhu's death last year was due to this reason. Sometimes the bottom of the cloud is almost connected to the ground. Meteorologists call this "ceiling zero." The plane cannot see the runway in the air and cannot land. When the gasoline runs out, it can only crash. The reason for the crash of the three planes in this city last Christmas was this. (2) There is fog on the ground. Although the weather is sunny above, the ground is shrouded in fog. The plane cannot find the airport and runway in the sky. Either the oil runs out and it crashes, or it collides with the mountains or other obstacles near the airport and crashes. The crash of a plane near Qingdao in January this year was due to this. (3) The temperature in the cloud layer is too low, and the wings of the plane freeze when it passes through it. Losing control, it naturally cannot fly forward and crashes. The cargo plane that crashed on the south bank of Chongqing in February this year was due to this reason.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned low clouds, fog, and frozen clouds are most common in winter. The occurrence of many unfortunate events in the aviation industry in winter has become a natural result. The weather will be clear and warm in the future, so I judge that such events will decrease, which can be called a good time for everyone to take a plane. However, in summer, there are also thunderstorms, which can often lead to plane crashes. Pilots and passengers should be careful. Fortunately, there are meteorological observations and forecasts about the weather conditions in various places and future weather conditions. The airline authorities should organize more meteorological services, and passengers should check whether the airline has weather information. If everyone pays attention to the weather, the unfortunate events in aviation can be reduced.</p>

<p>The sixth Sunday broadcast hosted by this newspaper was held yesterday at the Yuanchang Heming Radio Station. In the morning, Dr. Zhong Zhihe lectured on "The Latest Treatment Methods for Tuberculosis," and Secretary Zhong Xian lectured on "The Story of Our Lady of Lourdes."

<h3>More Than 2,000 Students of Jiaotong University Are Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Today to Petition, and Will Submit Eight Requirements to the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Student Autonomy Association of National Jiaotong University hosted the press yesterday afternoon at the Gongzhuo Hall of the school to report on the reasons and purposes of the strike and petition against the Ministry of Education's decision to suspend the two departments of Navigation and Marine Engineering of Jiaotong University, and called on the society to sympathize. It is said that the Ministry of Education discriminates against Jiaotong University in many ways, such as: (1) Last year, the Railway Management College of Beiping Jiaotong University and the Tangshan Branch were also ordered to separate and become independent from Jiaotong University. (2) Jiaotong University has more than 3,000 students and only more than 400 professors and staff, while Central University, which has a total of more than 5,000 students, has more than 1,300 faculty and staff. (3) Jiaotong University's monthly funding is only 10 million yuan, while its expenses reach 50 million yuan. In addition to the insufficient number of professors and staff salaries, it has to lose 70 million yuan every month. In the past, it was used from the rehabilitation funds, but the rehabilitation funds of more than one billion yuan have also been used up. Other universities in the country, such as Zhejiang University, have received an extra subsidy of 5 billion yuan, and Central University has received 2 billion yuan for faculty and staff's winter clothing. Other national universities also have more funding than Jiaotong University. (4) The Ministry of Education not only does not allow Jiaotong University to continue running the two departments of Marine Engineering and Navigation, but also does not allow the establishment of the two departments of Textile and Water Conservancy. Whether the Chemical Engineering Department can continue to run is still under consideration. However, other universities are ordered to expand, such as Fudan University adding a Fishery Specialist Department, and Tongji University adding a Law School. For the sake of protecting Jiaotong University, the students of Jiaotong University could not bear to see Jiaotong University being destroyed. They have submitted letters and petitions and sent representatives to Nanjing several times, but they have all failed. Therefore, they decided to protest with actions and decided to submit eight requirements to the Ministry of Education: (1) Jiaotong University should live up to its name and become a Jiaotong University. The various colleges and departments of Jiaotong University should not be divided, and the development of Jiaotong University should not be restricted. (2) Marine Engineering and Navigation should not be suspended. (3) Water Conservancy, Textile, and Chemical Engineering must continue to be established. (4) Jiaotong University should not be discriminated against. (5) Request to increase Jiaotong University's funding. (6) Request to increase Jiaotong University's equipment and school buildings. (7) Request to replenish the number of Jiaotong University professors and staff. (8) Request to increase Jiaotong University's public funding and quota. The school protection committee also severely corrected the remarks made by Fang Zhimou, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education, the day before yesterday, and supplemented Dean Wu's written remarks as follows: (1) The Ministry of Education claimed that the two departments of Marine Engineering and Navigation originally belonged to the Chongqing Ship School and should be returned to the original school for management after rehabilitation. The students believe that there is an urgent need for talents, and it is feared that simultaneous training in both schools will not be enough. How can they be reduced instead? (2) Minister Zhu and Director Zhou did express that they intended to specialize Jiaotong University and change it into an engineering school. Colleges and departments that are not engineering-related will be considered for adjustment. The students believe that it is not reasonable to specialize one school of Jiaotong University while expanding other schools. (3) Minister Zhu did express that the name of Jiaotong University was when it belonged to the Ministry of Communications, and it is no longer appropriate now. The Ministry of Education's spokesperson's claim that "there is no such thing at all" is actually going back on his own words. Also, it is reported that more than 2,000 students of Jiaotong University are scheduled to go to Nanjing today (the 12th) to petition and launch a school protection movement. It is claimed that they will never give up until they achieve their goals.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Hong Kong inter-port team met the Shanghai Hualian team for their second match in Shanghai yesterday. The match took place at 4:30 p.m. at the Yituan Stadium. The two teams were evenly matched, and after a fierce battle of 90 minutes, they could not be separated, drawing 3-3. The score was tied at 1-1 in the first half. Ticket sales were stopped in the afternoon, so the order was very good. There were about 15,000 fans, and the enthusiastic atmosphere was no less than the first inter-port match.</p>
<p>Evenly Matched</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hou Rongsheng, Sullivan, Xiao Huier, and Queli did not play, and were replaced by Xibai, Kifanluo, etc. Shanghai Hualian's Yan Shixin, Xin Fuzhen, and Han Longhai missed the match and were replaced by Zhang Lingen, Meng Yiliang, Gao Xiuqing, etc. The lineups of both sides had their strengths. Shanghai's strength was greatly reduced, so the situation was even more balanced. In 90 minutes, the two sides attacked and defended each other, forming a guerrilla-style battle. Like the previous day, it was tense but not exciting, and neither side had an ideal lineup. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Inter-Port</p>

<p>Circling in the Center</p>

Hualian arrived late, and the match started at 4:40 p.m. The visiting team kicked off, but there were no gains in the center circle. At the 5th minute, Luo Shoufu crossed high from the right corner, and Gao Xiuqing rushed forward. Hong Kong goalkeeper Gelakesi jumped up to catch the ball and collided with Gao, both falling to the ground injured. The match was paused for a while. At the 19th minute, Li Yao cut in from the sideline, Luo Shoufu missed, Gao Xiuqing arrived in time, and Xie Jinhong, eager to save the ball, collided with Gao again. Gelakesi hurriedly pushed the ball away, and Xie Jinhong was injured and left the field. The visiting team continued with ten players. Hualian took the opportunity to attack, but to no avail.</p>
<p>One Goal Each</p>
<p>After the 32nd minute, Xie Jinhong re-entered the field injured (dislocated left index finger). Kifanluo shot from 30 yards out, hitting the crossbar. Two minutes later, Li Yao dribbled past Xibai and crossed high in front of the goal. Jia Youliang rushed out from a cold spot and headed the ball in, scoring. 1-0, Hualian took the lead. After conceding the first goal, the Hong Kong team launched a major counterattack. Fortunately, Wu Qixiang and Zhang Banglun defended effectively. At the 38th minute, Feng Kunsheng injured his ankle and left the field. The visiting team continued with ten players. Sun Jinshun found an opening and shot, also hitting the crossbar. One minute before the end of the first half, the visiting team had a stroke of good luck. Liu Songsheng shot from 25 yards out, and Zhang Banglun was careless, so the goal was conceded. 1-1, the first half ended with a tie.</p>
<p>Another Good News</p>
<p>After the break, the match resumed. Hong Kong's Feng Kunsheng recovered from his injury and re-entered the field. He Yingfen and Xie Jinhe exchanged positions. After the contact, the Hong Kong team launched an all-out attack. Zou Wenzhi launched a solo raid, but unfortunately his shot was slightly off. At the 4th minute, Hualian also attempted a surprise attack. Li Yao and Youliang used the two wings to outflank, Youliang shot from about 10 yards out, landing in Gelask's embrace. At the 18th minute, Li Yao hooked the ball from the goal line and was stepped on by Zhang Jinhai and left the field. In less than a minute, Xibai kissed the ball with his hand outside the white line of the penalty area. Sun Jinshun took the penalty. Youliang deliberately blocked the goalkeeper's line of sight. He lifted his iron leg, and the ball flew into the net from the upper right corner. It was clearly visible. 2</p>
<p>Third Tie</p>
<p>At the 21st minute, Zhang Jinhai and Zou Wenzhi exchanged positions. Jinhai rushed out from a cold spot. He shot hard at the Hualian goal from 20 yards out. Zhang Banglun missed the ball. 2-2, another tie. At this time, Li Yao recovered from his injury and re-entered the field. After this, Hualian's offensive was quite strong. At the 30th minute, Sun passed the ball to an opening. Gao Xiuqing saw it clearly and pushed it into the net. 3-2, Hualian took the lead for the third time. With only eight minutes left in the game, He Yingfen sang and danced his way to success, scoring. 3-3 tie.

<h3>Mayor Wu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Decision Made to Improve Rice Rationing; People in Production Areas Have Weakened; Tin Rice Has Fallen Back</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu took the night train to Beijing last Friday to attend the National Price Conference, which has been made public. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is reported that the central authorities have agreed on the city's plan to improve rice rationing and have approved the allocation of food supply. The improved rice rationing plan may be announced and implemented today.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai, he immediately notified Qu Zhenhua, chairman of the Rice Industry Association, by telephone, instructing him to reassure his colleagues that the municipal government would provide close protection, and that rice grabs and shop attacks would be severely punished. Actions by rice merchants to hoard and speculate will also be severely punished. Therefore, starting today, the rice industry's Nanshi market is preparing to resume normal business, while the Beishi market resumed trading last Saturday.</p>
<p>In recent days, more and more ships have arrived at the north and south markets, and there have been no obstacles along the way. According to rice merchants, it is very likely that rice prices will fall below 200,000 yuan. However, the rice shops are still refusing to purchase the rationed rice thrown out by the Relief Bureau. It is heard that Mayor Wu has severely warned them about this matter.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Wuxi production area received by the rice market yesterday, tin rice (white rice) has fallen back to 242,500 yuan per stone. Transportation from the production area to Shanghai costs an additional 10,000 yuan or more in transportation fees. At the same time, it is reported that the people in the production area are weakening and continue to expect prices to fall.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau Adjusts Cigarette Tax Amount</h3>

A total of 31 brands, including Cressent and Front Gate, have already been implemented. The new tax amount of each brand of cigarette after the adjustment is as follows: Big Cressent (canned), Front Gate, each 1.14 million yuan (Big Cressent reduced by 300,000 yuan, Front Gate increased by 325,000 yuan), Brandy, Big Bank, Black Brand, Special Red Gold, Big Cressent, Old Knife, 550,000 yuan (generally increased by 250,000 yuan, of which Old Knife increased by 300,000 yuan), Big White Horse, Cressent, Million Gold, Night Paris 410,000 yuan (only Cressent increased by 20,000 yuan, the rest unchanged), Hai Luo, Hais, Middle Gao Le, Big Coffee, Big Golden Tiger, 395,000 yuan (Middle Gao Le unchanged, Hai Luo increased by 65,000 yuan, Hais increased by 70,000 yuan, Big Coffee increased by 15,000 yuan, Big Golden Tiger increased by 25,000 yuan), Tai Ba, Commander, Holly Cook, Doctor, Autumn Begonia, Big White Golden Dragon 365,000 yuan (Big White Golden Dragon unchanged, Taifei increased by 30,000 yuan, Commander increased by 40,000 yuan, Holly Cook increased by 15,000 yuan, Doctor increased by 50,000 yuan, Autumn Begonia increased by 15,000 yuan), Million Gold, Consul, Fairy, Small Golden Tiger 300,000 yuan (Small Golden Tiger unchanged, Million Gold increased by 25,000 yuan, Consul increased by 30,000 yuan, Fairy increased by 15,000 yuan), Big Sparrow, Taishan, Special Michelin, Quadriga, 255,000 yuan (Quadriga unchanged, Big Sparrow increased by 20,000 yuan, Taishan increased by 40,000 yuan, Michelin increased by 30,000 yuan), You Pí, Lushan, Small Coffee, Ship King 215,000 yuan (Ship King unchanged, You Pí increased by 30,000 yuan, Lushan increased by 25,000 yuan, Small Coffee increased by 20,000 yuan), Wanli, Dalu, Big Swan, Navigation, Four Virtues 190,000 yuan (Wanli, Big Swan, Four Virtues unchanged, Dalu increased by 40,000 yuan, Navigation increased by 35,000 yuan), Red Lantern, Keishi, Abacus, 165,000 yuan (Keishi unchanged, Red Lantern, Abacus increased by 15,000 yuan).</p>

<h3>Rampant Smuggling of Tung Oil in South China; Export Promotion Association Plans to Request Implementation of Measures</h3>
<p>The Export Promotion Association recently received a telegram from its Guangzhou office stating that tung oil smuggling is rampant in the area. The Hong Kong government announced that tung oil exports in the first quarter of this year reached over 17,000 tons, while customs reports show that only a few dozen tons of tung oil were exported through Guangzhou during the same period. As a result, prices in foreign markets have fallen from 3.2 cents to 2.8 cents, which has a significant impact on legitimate exporters. Exporters generally resent the authorities' tolerance of smuggling. It is understood that the association is now drafting two proposals for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval and separate implementation: (1) Sichuan has 20,000 tons of tung seeds, which will be transported to Shanghai along the Yangtze River. In the future, Shanghai is still planned to be the largest port for tung oil exports. (2) A Chinese Merchants Import and Export Management Committee will be organized, jointly composed of import and export institutions, customs, and local authorities. Due to the special international relations in the area, the Guangzhou side has decided to independently adopt certain measures before cooperating with the Hong Kong government in anti-smuggling work. The Export Promotion Association will strengthen the work of the Guangzhou office, reward informants, increase security forces, and strictly carry out anti-smuggling activities.</p>
<h3>Intestine Casing Exports Stalled Due to High Prices</h3>
<p>According to a certain authority in the export industry, before the war, England and the United States were the main markets for intestine casing exports from Jiangxi, with an average annual export value of approximately US$12 million, which later decreased to over US$8 million. This intestine casing is used by foreigners not only to make surgical sutures and gut strings but also to make food products, with a very wide range of uses. The northwestern provinces of China all produce intestine casings, with Gansu Province having the largest production. The province can produce an average of about 500,000 pieces per year. Currently, due to the extremely high purchase prices in Shanghai, there is not only no profit to be made, but losses will be incurred. Therefore, intestine casing exports have essentially come to a standstill.</p>
<p>February Import and Export Statistics</p>

<h3>Mexico Lowers Gold Export Prices</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] It was learned today that the Bank of Mexico has lowered its gold export prices by approximately 2 and 1/6 percent since the 9th. The new price for a 50-peso gold coin is approximately US$47.938, which is equivalent to approximately US$39.763 per ounce of pure gold. New York merchants were deeply surprised by this price reduction. Yesterday's reduction in the gold price by the Bank of Mexico was the third price reduction since the beginning of March. During this period, Mexico's asking price has fallen from US$42.92 per ounce to yesterday's US$39.76. It is understood that based on yesterday's asking price of US$47.938, the demand for 50-peso gold coins has rebounded strongly.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Revisions to Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Trade Association, because of the difficulties in implementing 4 of the 15 articles of the Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations distributed by the Price and Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, specifically requested the Commodity Tax Bureau to revise four points: (1) To request a change in the items on the original and duplicate receipts (regarding Articles 7 and 8 of the Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations); (2) To request exemption from obtaining permits for separate transportation of tobacco leaves sold locally (Article 10); (3) To request that semi-monthly reports be changed to monthly reports (Article 12); (4) To request that the Bureau should jointly audit accounts with the responsible trade association (Article 14). It is understood that the Commodity Tax Bureau submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry instructed that the opinions of the Tobacco Leaf Association on the proposed revisions to points 1, 2, and 3 are feasible and approved for revision. However, regarding point 4, the audit of accounts, the tax authorities, in order to assess the actual sales and inventory of goods, may inspect the goods and audit the books when necessary, based on the tax rate, and there is no regulation requiring joint handling with the trade association, so the original provision should be maintained and not revised.</p>
<p>In addition, Article 3 of the Regulations clearly states: "Shanghai area tobacco leaf merchants, regardless of Chinese or foreign merchants, should uniformly fill out an application registration form and attach the local competent authority's permit for construction, and request the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau to issue a registration certificate, which will be reported to the tax authorities for record." The association should notify all members to bring their Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau business registration certificates as soon as possible. Those who have not yet been approved should bring a receipt from the Social Affairs Bureau acknowledging their application for registration from their respective businesses to the Bureau to complete registration, in order to comply with the procedures.</p>
<p>The Tobacco Leaf Trade Association believes that the Commodity Tax Bureau will soon implement the Tobacco Leaf Management Regulations, and all member businesses should go to the Bureau to complete registration. However, there are still many members who have not applied for a business registration certificate from the Social Affairs Bureau. The association will notify all members to go to the Social Affairs Bureau as soon as possible to avoid delays.</p>

<h3>From "Disaster Relief First" to "Suppress Bandits First"</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Changsha, May 5th, by Our Correspondent in Tingzhou, Huang Chao Ru</p>
<p>Last year's autumn harvest in Hunan Province was estimated to be 70% of normal. Southern Hunan harvested 70%, and families should have been well-fed. In addition, a large amount of relief supplies were transferred to Hunan Province, so the disaster victims should have recovered. However, the current situation in Hunan is that not only are families not well-fed, but the severity of the disaster is no less than last year.</p>
<p>The most common problem in rural Hunan now is the lack of funds, seeds, and draft cattle. Because the disaster relief work was insufficient during last year's disaster, the only way for disaster victims to survive, besides eating grass roots and tree bark, was to resort to high-interest loans. As a result, everything harvested in the autumn was used to repay the loans, and the situation of having nothing left over was already apparent early on. The relief supplies went into the pockets of a few people, and not only did Hunan's construction not make any progress, but the disaster victims did not receive the benefits of "work-for-relief." Now, the disaster-stricken situation in last year's disaster areas has not diminished.</p>
<p>Grain Shortage; Disaster Difficult to Avoid</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Lan, a prominent figure in Hunan Province, recently returned to the province from his native Qiyang, Hunan. When talking to visiting reporters about the disaster situation in southern Hunan, he spoke from the perspective of the people and witnessed the current situation in rural southern Hunan. Therefore, his conclusion was, "This year is not as satisfactory as we had hoped, and the disaster in southern Hunan may recur." Yes, the recurrence of the disaster in southern Hunan this year will be an unavoidable fact. If you don't believe it, be careful when the grain is short; the facts will tell us what will happen.</p>
<p>After Chairman Wang shouted the slogan "Disaster Relief First," he followed it up with "Suppress Bandits First." When he shouted the slogan "Suppress Bandits First," Hunan was plagued by frequent bandit alarms. But at that time, the bandits were just small scattered bandits, causing minor disturbances, and were not a major problem. Who knew that after this slogan was shouted, the bandit alarms in Hunan progressed from scattered bandits to organized communist bandits? Currently, the communist bandits are rampaging in the mountainous areas of western Hunan, which have long suffered from communist disasters, causing everyone to turn pale at the mention of bandits. Even the central government is paying attention to this.</p>
<p>Li Xiannian's Troops Return to the Deep Mountains of Western Hunan</p>
<p>The communist army that invaded western Hunan this time is the remnants of Li Xiannian's troops, led by Li Renlin and Wang Dinglie, with about 2,000 people. They crossed the Yangtze River from Xingshan, Hubei, around the Lunar New Year last year. At that time, it was publicized that this group of remnant bandits had been eliminated. Who knew that after a month or two, they suddenly invaded western Hunan from the Hefeng area of Hubei, once reaching Dongting Creek between Yuanling and Taoyuan, preparing to sneak across the Yuan River. After strict prevention, they began to retreat westward. Western Hunan is full of mountains, barren land, and poor people, and the people are fierce. There is a situation where civilians and bandits are indistinguishable. When the communist bandits invaded this area, it was like fierce tigers entering the mountains and dragons getting water. Although the military and militias shout about suppression every day, they have not been able to harm a single hair on their heads, so they come and go freely, as if there is no one there. The number of people has now increased, and there is no mention of any success in the suppression at the moment.</p>
<p>Extinguishing Sparks; Increasing Political Power</p>
<p>A few thousand communist bandits are not worth paying attention to. As long as the government can increase its military power a little, I believe they can be completely resolved. What is worrying is that the invasion of Hunan by Wang and Li's bandits is different from ordinary banditry. As of now, there have been very few reports of harassment in the places they have passed. Their effect is measured, and the political significance outweighs the military significance. In western Hunan, which is both "poor" and "ignorant," after being incited by them, there is indeed some cause for concern. A single spark can start a prairie fire. If it cannot be extinguished early, who can guarantee peace and security on the borders of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou? And extinguishing this spark with military force alone seems insufficient; political power should also be increased simultaneously. How to increase political power? Chairman Wang's stable style, when applied to peacetime, especially in Hunan after a long illness, is still suitable for the needs. But to deal with communist bandits, a bold and decisive approach is necessary. As long as the politics are clear and the local area is stable, no matter how much the communist bandits "talk sweet nothings," they will not be able to gain a foothold. If you drive away the sparrows for the sake of the forest or drive away the fish for the sake of the deep water, it would be too bad and too dangerous. Time is the most precious thing. We hope that the Hunan authorities will seize the time and achieve a major victory in suppressing bandits with equal emphasis on politics and military affairs!</p>

<p>— By our reporter Fan Shiqin, dispatch from Zhengzhou, May 5th</p>
<p>After the Yellow River returned to its old course, Liu Bocheng had no way to steal chickens and dogs along the Longhai Railway in eastern Henan, so he ran to the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan to do good deeds. He always couldn't get past this railway. If he couldn't find trouble on the Longhai Railway, he would play tricks on the Pinghan Railway. As a result, the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan was filled with the flames of war, and countless souls cried out in vain.</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng truly has the heart of a snake. He wants to swallow the nearly 500 li of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan in one gulp. The plan is to do it like this: blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge, take a long section of the railway from the Yellow River Railway Bridge to Anyang Road into his hands, and then, as soon as he opens his mouth, won't he swallow it all into his stomach? He has tried this in late March and early April, but the result is that an elephant cannot be swallowed by a snake.</p>
<p>Sun Refuses to Surrender; Insists on Defending His City</p>
<p>If he can't swallow it whole, then he can only cut it up and eat it piece by piece. This is what Liu Bocheng is doing with the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan now. Therefore, after his initial defeat near the Yellow River Railway Bridge, he concentrated his forces and changed course to Jixian, the intersection of Qingluo and Pinghan Roads. As a result, he didn't take Jixian, but he took Hongxian, and the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan was cut into two sections by him. After this, he will naturally eat Tangyin first, and then Anyang.</p>
<p>It took Liu Bocheng twenty-seven days to eat Tangyin, which was hard enough for him. Originally, he didn't want to pay any price to eat Tangyin. At first, he thought that Tangyin was surrounded by him, and he could sit back and enjoy the benefits with just a "letter of persuasion to surrender." However, Sun Dianying, the national army soldier defending the city, was also a tough man. After receiving Liu Bocheng's "letter of persuasion to surrender," he wrote a "letter of refusal to surrender" to him, saying in the letter: "If you have the guts, attack your way; if I have the guts, I'll defend my way; if I don't have the guts, I won't defend my city, and if you don't have the guts, you don't need to talk nonsense."</p>
<p>Kite Gambit; A Legendary Story</p>
<p>At this point, Liu Bocheng used a kite trick to distribute leaflets to the city, saying that the city must be very panicked, so it's "better to surrender." Here, I heard a legendary story. It is said that Sun Dianying used a rope to hoist a communist into the city, treated him to a big meal, and even invited him to see a play. Then, he used a rope to hoist him out of the city. At the time of parting, Sun Dianying said to the communist: "Brother, you can see the situation in the city. Go back and report it."</p>
<p>This dramatic story was still spread by Sun Dianying's office, using this story to illustrate the communist army's "persuasion to surrender" and Sun Dianying's "refusal to surrender," which is a truly excellent masterpiece. There are stories of beheading envoys who refuse to surrender in history, but their subtlety is not as good as Sun Dianying's invitation to envoys to refuse to surrender. Sun Dianying issued his will a few hours before the city fell, and there has been no news since. It remains to be seen whether Sun Dianying's character will step down from this era's stage or will step up again, depending on his fate.</p>
<p>Tangyin and Anyang are just the bait on the hook. Liu Bocheng is currently redeploying outside the column, and his purpose is naturally to eat these two pieces of meat. The column's defenders are the famous Li Tietou (Zhenqing). How that martial drama will play out is not worth talking about. Let's get down to business and talk about how Liu Bocheng's gluttony will make millions of people in northern Henan food for his chopping board.</p>
<p>The war situation in northern Henan is obviously that the national army is taking a defensive position. Soon, the national army will definitely change to an offensive position. At that time, it will be the end of the gluttonous Liu Bocheng. Tangyin and Anyang are just bait on a hook. One day, the national army will firmly grasp the fishing rod from the Yellow River Railway Bridge to Xinxiang. At that time, it will be impossible for Liu Bocheng to spit out the bait he swallowed.</p>
<p>The Jinpu Railway is the same. In the overall war situation, the national army is advancing in a straight line, opening up this railway, and uniting the north and south. The communist army is advancing in a horizontal line, destroying this railway, and uniting the east and west. Therefore, the intersection between east, west, north, and south is the place of confrontation. Heaven says: Those who walk in a straight line will prosper, and those who walk in a horizontal line will perish. Heaven also says: Those who gain heaven will survive, and those who defy heaven will perish.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Drums of War, Refugees in Shanxi Province Express Their Feelings</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Taiyuan, May 5th, by our correspondent Zhong Shu</p>
<p>Amidst the extremely tense situation where the sound of war drums is heard throughout Shanxi, I would like to report to the readers about the unprecedentedly tragic events suffered by the people: The Chinese Communists have always boasted of "the people" and "democracy," but in reality, the people not only do not want to accept their "benevolence" and "democracy," but on the contrary, wherever the Communist army arrives, the people flee in fear. People leave their hometowns, abandon their property, and even abandon their children along the way. Their pain is truly beyond imagination. Recently, tens of thousands of people have fled to Taiyuan from various places. The rest are scattered in Xinxian in northern Shanxi, Shouyang in central Shanxi, Jixian, Qixian, Taigu, Linfen in southern Shanxi, Yuncheng, etc., creating a major political burden. (1) People from Mengxian said that they had experienced the Communist Party's ten years of rule. As soon as they expected the national army to arrive, they could easily leave. Now that the national army is withdrawing, they have no choice but to follow the national army westward. Although the county magistrate and military and political leaders have insulted them, there are still tens of thousands of people who have followed the county government westward, and there are even more who have automatically dispersed in all directions. Now, within 20 li around Mengxian City, there is not a single man, woman, or child left. One day, two large carts of old and young men and women were traveling to Ganhe when they unfortunately encountered a unit of the Communist army, who immediately strafed them with machine guns. In an instant, no one, neither people nor animals, survived. (2) People from Zhaocheng said that when the national army withdrew, the able-bodied men in their county first volunteered to follow the army as self-defense forces to assist the national army in combat, and then the old and young also fled to Linfen together. (3) People from Dingxiang said that Duan Longguang, a self-cultivating farmer in Liuhui Village in the county, had his fields confiscated by the Communist army, his houses were distributed to people who followed the Communist army to settle old scores, and he was ordered to demolish them immediately, otherwise they would be set on fire. He was also forced to hand over 150 silver dollars. Duan couldn't come up with the money, so he was hung for two incense sticks (until two incense sticks burned out). Duan was honest and simple and was respected by the villagers. The entire village petitioned, but the Communist Party still refused. In desperation, everyone collected 150 yuan by contributing three or two yuan each, and only then did the matter end, but Duan's hands had already been dislocated.</p>
<h3>Across the Yalu River</h3>
<p>— A dispatch from Shenyang by our reporter Zhao Zhan, May 1st</p>
<p>Taking a train from Shenyang to Andong, we departed from the Liaozhong Plain, traveled southeast along the Changbai Mountains, and traversed through majestic mountains and beautiful scenery. In late spring, the weeds and wildflowers, the mountains nurturing water, and the green landscapes, were sure to delight people. The small rivers were slowly rippling with yellow waves.</p>
<p>Shadows of Transportation</p>
<p>On the An-Shen Railway, we enjoyed California's sweet raisins, a small box costing fifty yuan in circulating currency, which could be considered cheap and good.</p>
<p>The city of Andong, located on the banks of the Yalu River, is a prominent point, its food supply relying entirely on shipments from Shenyang, making the An-Shen Railway its lifeline. The An-Shen Railway opened to traffic in January, was interrupted in February, and repaired again in March. During the twenty days of interruption, grain prices doubled. After the resumption of traffic, grain prices dropped slightly, but there was still an upward trend. The future of transportation is not optimistic, and "grain shortage" remains a shadow over the lives of 300,000 citizens.</p>
<p>The An-Shen Railway is 260 kilometers long, and the number of bridges and tunnels is the highest in the Northeast. The longest, the Fujinling Tunnel, is 4,884 feet long. When the National Army entered Andong in December last year, the Communist Army thoroughly destroyed it before retreating. After emergency repairs, the bridges were all made of sleeper frameworks. During the summer flood season, these temporary pontoon bridges would inevitably be washed away. This is the most urgent problem in Andong. However, due to financial and material difficulties, the transportation authorities are helpless to carry out timely repairs.</p>
<p>Political Situation in An-Tung</p>
<p>Andong has a total of fifteen counties and two cities. The National Army recovered eleven counties and two cities, but in March, the Communist Army invaded and occupied five northern counties including Jinchuan. In terms of the recovered areas, only two counties were completely taken over, namely Andong and Zhuanghe. Most of Andong is mountainous, and grain production could originally be self-sufficient, but after the war, it relied entirely on aid from other provinces, which increased the difficulties of the Andong provincial government. Chairman Gao Xibing can be said to be a pro-people official. Recently, he firmly resigned due to his inability to solve the people's suffering, but his resignation was not approved. He himself is an industrial talent, a native of Fengcheng, Andong, 51 years old, a graduate of Lowell Textile University in the United States, and has served as the Director of the Xinjiang Construction Department. He is a big man with a compassionate heart.</p>
<p>Andong is indeed extremely poor. The average farmer does not have two months of food reserves. Under the coercion of the spring famine, spring plowing is hopeless. Spring is a period when farmers transition from hunger to death. During the year and two months that the Communist Army occupied the area, they issued 30 million yuan in "Northeast Promissory Notes," prohibiting the use of other currencies and forcibly stipulating that the exchange rate between circulating currency and Northeast Promissory Notes was two to one. As a result, the wealth of the people was plundered. Chairman Gao said that in his hometown of Fengcheng, seven households cannot find 500 yuan in circulating currency, which shows the extent of the people's poverty. This year, Andong's land tax has been suspended, and the farmers are very grateful for the central government's kindness.</p>
<p>Andong's education recovery has been relatively good. The cultural level of the recovered areas is relatively high. The recovery of middle schools has reached 80% of the original state, with more than 9,600 students. The recovery of national education has reached 60%, with more than 105,000 students. During the Communist Army's occupation, boys and girls attended the same schools. Now, boys' schools and girls' schools are being implemented separately.</p>
<p>Three Major Specialties</p>
<p>Andong, a fertile border area, has long been coveted by the Japanese for its rich products. The Japanese once dreamed of building a beautiful industry here. Andong's most valuable products are wood, tussah silk, and tobacco; the minerals here include coal, iron, gold, copper, and lead, but the quality of the coal is poor. The iron ore is of good quality but the yield is low. The gold reserve is about two metric tons. Soybean oil is also a major product.</p>
<p>In the northern counties of Changbai, Mengjiang, and Fusong, there are still ancient forests that are thousands of years old, dense and lush, blocking out the sunlight, covering an area of about 4 million cubic meters. If fully utilized, there would be no problem in supplementing 200,000 railway sleepers needed each year in the Northeast, and there could be a large amount of timber for export. Currently, it is under the control of the Communist Army, and the source of timber is completely cut off. The reporter visited the Andong branch of the Northeast Production Administration's lumber mill. The factory was originally the Pseudo-Manchukuo Mudanjiang Timber Industry Co., Ltd., jointly founded by the Kwantung Army and the Pseudo-Manchukuo Ministry of Industry. It could build large wooden ships with a load of 300 tons and was very large in scale. The Production Administration took over the materials of this factory to maintain the lives of more than 300 old and weak workers. Eighty percent of the factory was destroyed by the Communist Army. Now, there are only over a hundred unfinished ship frames, lying in the factory like fish bones.</p>
<p>Tussah silk is a type of silk that grows on tussah trees. Andong's production accounts for 70% of the country's production and 50% of the world's production. The tussah silk industry was not developed in the Pseudo-Manchukuo era. The intention was that the Japanese were afraid of resisting the sales of Japanese silk. The Japanese destroyed one-third of the tussah trees. Mr. Li Youshan, Director of the Andong Construction Department, said: "We can restore one-sixth this year, and we hope to restore all of them next year." The reporter visited the Minsheng Processing Factory No. 1 of the Andong Provincial Government, which produces tussah silk. The factory was originally founded by the Japanese Nishihara Fuji Gas Company in the seventh year of the Republic of China and was one of the two major tussah silk factories in the Far East (the other being in Tokyo), with a capital of 10 million yuan. It originally had 9,500 spindles, producing 45,000 catties of tussah silk per month; now it has 2,000 spindles, producing 10,000 catties of tussah silk per month, and the products are transported and sold to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Tobacco is a promising product, produced in Xiuyan and Fengcheng, with a quality comparable to Guizhou tobacco. Fengcheng's monthly tobacco tax is 100 million yuan. I visited the paper mill taken over by the Committee (Note: this is Zhao Zhan, this reporter), and they were all dilapidated and difficult to resume work.</p>
<p>The Yalu River is under strict blockade, truly "white waves flowing in vain, no shadows of sails." On the opposite bank is Sinuiju, North Korea, and the 3,098-foot-long Yalu River iron bridge is closed off by a silk net. Climbing Zhenjiang Mountain, a famous scenic spot in Andong, a panoramic view of the great river is in sight, arousing emotions! Regarding the issue of navigation on the Yalu River, our side is negotiating with the Soviet army, and navigation is expected to resume soon. Before the September 18th Incident, the police power of the Yalu River was entirely in our hands. Now the situation is different. If anyone dares to boldly sail on the river, the Soviet army will shoot, thus causing suffering to our fishermen and North Korean fishermen, whose livelihoods have lost their guarantee. It also blocks the outlet of timber from the upper reaches of the Yalu River.</p>
<p>The government attaches great importance to the issue of water police. The Andong Water Police Bureau has been established, and water police are being trained. Forest police are also being prepared for training.</p>

<h3>Art and Craftsmanship on the Rise: International Offset Color Printing Exhibition</h3>
<p>— A dispatch from Leiden on the 2nd</p>
<p>The International Offset Printing Exhibition recently held at the Gemeente Musea in The Hague has a banner with the words "Als de steenen spreken" (If the stones could speak). The venue displays lithographic printing presses and a huge stone, 1.2 meters high and 84 centimeters wide, to show that the world's latest web offset color printing originated from the old-fashioned lithography, but is more exquisite and magical than lithographic prints.</p>
<p>Full Range on Display, Including Products from the UK, USA, and USSR</p>
<p>Lithography is gradually being eliminated in the European market, and it is being replaced by offset rubber plates. The zinc plates commonly seen in Shanghai, China, if not printed on paper plates, with a 2.2 cm thick base plate nailed under the zinc sheet, can only be flat printed, and the printing speed is not high. Now, the zinc plate used for offset printing with fine patterns is a large zinc plate as thick as tinplate, a whole sheet measuring 1.4 meters long and 1.1 meters wide. If the image is 16 cm long and 11 cm wide, each whole zinc plate can accommodate 40 images for simultaneous printing. For color printing, the standard is usually up to six colors. The image to be printed is divided into six large plates, and printed six times. The maximum limit is 12 colors, which requires dividing the image into twelve plates, each printed with one color. When printing, the zinc plate with the front image is fixed on the roller of the web press and dyed with a color of ink, which is transferred to the rubber plate on another roller to form a reverse image, which is then transferred to the paper to be printed, resulting in a front image. The printing speed is very high. By using the rubber plate to gradually transfer the different colors of ink onto the paper surface, no matter how rough the paper is, it can easily penetrate and appear clearly. If it is a color photograph, it is even easier to rely on offset rubber printing to see the true beauty of nature. In terms of printed matter from European countries, from valuable ancient paintings and illustrations in books to cheap can labels, and even advertisements and toys, all other printing methods have been abolished and replaced by offset rubber printing. The more copies printed, the cheaper it becomes. Color printing requires at least 50,000 or 100,000 copies, otherwise it is too uneconomical. The exhibits in this exhibition, in addition to those made in the Netherlands, include those from the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, and other countries.</p>
<p>Ten Categories: Old Books, Famous Paintings, Calendars</p>
<p>In short, there are ten categories: (1) Calendars. (2) Attractive travel brochures for land, sea, and air travel, usually 22 cm long and 11 cm wide. (3) Various advertising posters, vertical ones 95 cm high and 62 cm wide, with an illustration of the exhibition hall's general layout. (4) Wall posters that are changed periodically in theaters and cinemas. (5) Offset rubber plate reproductions of ancient paintings and famous paintings. (6) Advertisements or wrapping paper for fruits and vegetables that are enlarged and finely printed from films made by three-color cameras. (7) Direct color printing on various cans. (8) Tea, coffee, or chocolate candy packet paper. (9) Children's toys printed on thick cardboard to prevent damage. (10) Illustrated label collections that enlighten children's scientific knowledge. Each finely printed color label is about 6 cm high and 4 cm wide. This is a special type of entertainment that Chinese children cannot easily enjoy. It is a wonderful advertisement from large companies in developed countries serving the public, a step further than the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin" character cigarette cards from British and American tobacco companies. Generally speaking, Western children like to eat chocolate candy, and each package contains a label, on which flowers and birds are printed. Collecting them for a long time can complete the whole set. The original factory prints and gives away a detailed explanation of hundreds of flowers and hundreds of islands every year, providing about 200 labels for pasting. Having one in hand is like reading a specialized book, which not only nourishes the mind but also improves knowledge.</p>
<p>Wolf's Model Attracts the Most Attention</p>
<p>The most eye-catching item in the entire venue is the model of the photographic plate-making process created by M.J. Wolf of Paris, France. It is divided into four rooms: the washing and drying department after photographic fixing, progressing step by step, and using white, yellow, and black colors to show the high and low light levels in each room. The institutions and groups participating in the exhibition and competition include photographers, graphic artists, plate-making departments, typesetting foundries, paper wholesalers, poster printing companies, packaging can factories, printing houses, publishing departments, advertising companies, city museums, etc., which shows the flourishing of new social undertakings in the West.</p>

<p>Please Repair the Decayed Wires Quickly</p>
<p>The wires in Wenxianli, Lane 170, Fuxing Middle Road, have been in disrepair for many years. The rubber outside the wires has fallen off. Touching the cement wall on rainy days causes a slight numbness, which is probably due to leakage. Most of the houses in this lane are old, and there is a danger of fire at any time due to electrical leakage. Therefore, please ask the electric company to send someone to inspect and repair it as soon as possible to prevent fires and ensure the safety of the people. Please also inform us of the address of the electric company so that we can directly request it. (Resident of Wenxianli) Editor's note: The Shanghai Electric Power Company is located at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road. Please contact them.</p>
<p>The Lights in Jixiang Lane are Dim</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I live in Jixiang Lane, Doushi Street, Nanshi. The lights in the lane are dim and people cannot see each other's faces, especially at the entrance of the lane, where it is even darker. Pedestrians often bump into each other. However, the area near the main road is as bright as a picture (because it is a newly built shanty town connected to street lights). Please ask the China Merchants Electric Company to change the connection as soon as possible so that the residents of the lane can regain their light and be endlessly grateful.

<h3>Postscript to "Lucky Grass of Dan'an"</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ciqing of Liangxi having already published his "Plum Villa Collection," widely circulated and praised, someone asked me, "Mr. Ciqing's elder brother, Mr. Fuqiao, was known in his time for his talent and unrestrained spirit. Are his poems and essays available to be read?" I replied in the affirmative: "Have you ever read the sixty-year self-preface of the Qingniu Daoist? The preface says,</p>
<p>'I collected the poems I wrote from youth to old age, deleted nine out of ten, and kept them as old drafts, only for my own enjoyment.'"</p>
<p>Thus, the remaining works are originally less than one-tenth of the total. Moreover, Mr. Fuqiao returned to the Daoist mountains in the year of Yi Mao, enjoying a life of seventy-five years. During those fifteen years, who knows how much more was discarded? Now, seven years have passed since Mr. Fuqiao's death, experiencing great changes. Who knows how much of the surviving drafts remain after the calamities? Therefore, the publication of "Lucky Grass of Dan'an" should not be delayed.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuqiao once wrote a five-character律詩 (regulated verse) for the "Plum Village Collection." When Yang Lingzhou, Uncle-Consort, read the line "High fame mistakenly led to white hair," he clapped the table and exclaimed in admiration, immediately requesting a matching verse for his own fiftieth birthday poem. Now, examining the surviving drafts, the lingering echoes still remain. Is this not fortunate?</p>
<p>"The elegant demeanor of the Director of the Imperial College has ceased, how many autumns have the remaining volumes weathered? The old men of the Guanshan region weep, the abandoned palace is filled with sorrow for the millet and sorghum. The writing is straight, pursuing the green history, high fame mistakenly leads to white hair. The desolate Yu Kai-fu lies ill, remembering the southern state." The self-preface also says:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu Yannong and I are bound by a friendship that transcends life and death. He praised my poems as being between Loujiang and Xincheng, this is one true friend. Mr. Hou Xiangqian praised my 'Wandering in Aiyuan' lyrics, saying, 'The rhythm is short, and the rhyme is long, resembling Zhu Zhutuo's 'Selling Flowers' lyrics on Yuhuatai,' this is one true friend. Mr. Hua Ruoxi met me in the capital, calling me 'Poet Fu.' When we parted at Maple Bridge, he earnestly promised to meet again later, this is one true friend. Mr. Yang Fanfu appreciated my mountain travel poems, especially the line, 'If you are tired of night travel, lend me a stone bed and cloud,'...this is one true friend... Mr. Du Zihui saw my Five Ancient Verses titled 'Dragon Pool Delivering Rice Picture,' and praised it for its rigorous form and not being unworthy of a master, this is one true friend. Mr. Tao Duanyi regarded me as a pine and cypress in the cold winter, this is also one true friend."</p>
<p>Alas! The "Wandering in the Amusement Park" lyrics, the mountain travel poems, and the "Dragon Pool Delivering Rice Picture," all these works have now been scattered and lost. Heaven has taken away this culture, is it not a pity!</p>
<p>Mr. Fuqiao's given name was Jingrong, his courtesy name was Fubo, and another courtesy name was Shaoquan. He was born on the winter solstice day, the sixth day of the eleventh month of the year Ding Chou, during the Ugly hour (1-3 AM), in the official residence of Xinzhou. Therefore, he called himself Qian Seng, and later called himself Erquan, Danweng, Old Man Fubai, and was also known as Qingniu Daoist. His grandfather, En Huan, whose courtesy name was Leshan, also named Peilun, was dispatched to Hubei as a county magistrate. When he arrived in Wuchang, the city was already surrounded, so he led his son Xie, along with family members Ding Gui and Wu Fushou, and rappelled down the city wall to enter. When the city fell, he died in street fighting. The matter was reported to the emperor, who posthumously named him Wumin, established a dedicated ancestral hall, granted sacrificial rites and burial, and bestowed a hereditary title of Yunqiyu and a biography in the Hanlin Academy. He was married to Madam Yang, the daughter of National Student Suizhang. Her father, Tingzhen, whose courtesy name was Ziquan, also named Ganchen, was a Supplementary Tribute Student on the Shun Tian list in the year Xianfeng Yi Mao, also inheriting the Yunqiyu title, and was appointed as the Prefect of Shinan Prefecture and Wuchang Prefecture in Hubei, gaining a reputation for his administration, and was enshrined in the Temple of Famous Officials. He was also married to Madam Li, the daughter of Zhongqian Gong, a Juren (recommended man) of Ren Wu, who died in the line of duty in Conghua County, Guangdong, and was posthumously named Ganglie. In the year Tongzhi Xin Wei, the tenth year, Mr. Fuqiao was only seven years old. He was bedridden on a boat in Jingli. Two years later, he began to take refuge at the Yellow Crane Tower. In the year Guangxu Ding Chou, at the age of thirteen, he followed Prefect Ziquan to his post in Shinan Prefecture, where he began to write. On his birthday in the year Ji Mao, he composed the lyrics to "East Wind First Branch":</p>
<p>"In the past, I encountered the sun's birth. (My birthday happens to be on the winter solstice) Now I meet the snowy sky. It has been fifteen years. To be considered still young at night, today is no longer childish. Time flies, reading under the curtain, please start from now on. You must surround the stove, melting and casting poetry and books, roasting and studying history." (Half)</p>
<p>In the year Ren Wu, at the age of eighteen, Huang Zongshi Tifang, a student of the Wuxi County School, was selected as the top Xiang student in the prefecture. He was appreciated by Teacher Wang Han of Xuyi, and was added as an increase student after passing the annual examination at a higher level. He was appreciated by Teacher Wang Yiwu of Xiangze, who also published the "Six Xiangzhong Lyricists." Afterwards, he repeatedly took the imperial examinations in the north and south, but failed five times. He once wrote a poem:</p>
<p>"How can I have a Cheng Lian's three-foot zither? I dare not say there are few who understand my music in the world! I only follow the intentions of my teachers, not to comfort my parents' expectations!" In the year Gui Wei, Prefect Ziquan was transferred to Wuchang Prefecture. In the year Bing Xu, in the third month of spring, he resigned from his post and returned to his hometown. He married the eldest daughter of Yang Zuozhou, the county instructor of Liyang, a fellow townsperson. In the eighth month, Prefect Ziquan succumbed to a serious illness and passed away at the young age of fifty-one. At that time, Mr. Fuqiao was twenty-two years old, and Mr. Ciqing was only eighteen! They strictly followed the ancient rituals, their grief exceeding the norm, weeping continuously for a hundred days, and not eating meat for a hundred days. The villagers all praised their filial piety, but Mr. Fuqiao and his brother still felt it was not enough. In the year Wu Zi, people from Shinan who were going to take the autumn examination requested that Prefect Ziquan be enshrined in the Temple of Famous Officials. Mr. Fuqiao then traveled to Chu, writing "Traveling at Night" lyrics, using the rhyme of "Why do the clouds lightly scatter":</p>
<p>"Dream of home scatters in an instant. So desolate, I wake up and still see the bright moon and twinkling stars. Separated by a long, long river, not to mention the countless sounds of autumn. Looking back, the clouds over Henggao are broken. I remember sitting and sleeping, leaning on my pillow for a long time, gradually the Jade Rope is low in the Silver River. Darkly changing the green of my temples. In the year Geng Yin, he traveled with his brother-in-law, Mr. Yang Weiyun, to the Ren Cao Hermitage, visiting the ruins of Guanhua Pavilion, and composed a Five Ancient Verses using the rhyme of the Xu Shu Ting Ji (Exposing Books Pavilion Collection) climbing Xushan:</p>
<p>"Liang Fen once sat here at night, his heart filled with a hundred emotions; Though his ambition was strong, he could only write in vain after climbing high. Buying wine to dispel poverty and sorrow, he relied on a close friend; Life after life, green is pre-destined, friendship is admired since ancient times; Leaving a shadow in the empty hall, a manifestation of Vimalakirti. ... We climbed again, still leaning on the dangerous railing, two hundred years of elegance, the hills and valleys collapsed in an instant; Only the ruins of the abandoned pavilion remain, the name Guanhua unchanged; A guest described his travels, surpassing Heng in the south and constant in the north; Hometown is just a short distance away, yet I laugh at my lack of experience. ..."</p>
<p>In the year Gui Si, his mother, Madam Li, passed away. Mr. Fuqiao buried Prefect Ziquan and Madam Li at Ma'anwu in Huishan, and wrote a biography:</p>
<p>"I only hope that every word is based on fact, not daring to falsely praise my parents or slander them. It is up to the gentlemen who write in this era to examine it."</p>
<p>Ziquan was granted the posthumous title of Duke Wumin for dying in the line of duty in Wuchang. Madam Li was the second daughter of Duke Ganglie, who died in the line of duty in Conghua, a fellow townsperson. Her nature was inherently respectful and compliant, and she served Madam Hu Tai, the concubine, from a young age. In the autumn of Jia Yin, when Duke Ganglie died in the line of duty in Guangdong, amid her grief, she took care of her mother and stepmother, acting in accordance with propriety. She did not prolong the mourning with Buddhist monks, following the instructions of Duke Ganglie! In the year Gui Hai, at the age of twenty-nine, she came to return to Prefect Ziquan. Two years later, in the year Yi Chou, Fuqiao was born; two years later, in the year Ding Mao, his eldest daughter, Qingfen, was born, who later married into the Chen family of Chengjiang. Two years later, in the year Ji Si, Mr. Ciqing was born; two years later, in the year Xin Wei, his second daughter, Huifen, was born, who later married into the Feng family of Kunling. Madam Tai had always been frugal in clothing and food, never wasting a single coin or piece of silk. If she was presented with light, warm, sweet, and crispy items, she would distribute them to the elderly and young. Her younger brother, Mr. Li Yuyan, was a famous teacher in the county, and my father and uncles all studied under him. Her younger sister married into the Tang family of Xizhang, and died early without children. She provided for them without interruption, treating her step-nephew as her own nephew.</p>
<p>In the year Guangxu Jia Chen, the thirtieth year, Mr. Fuqiao revisited Ren Cao Hermitage, recording it in a poem:</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, I swept the moss here, bringing my son again today: The old Guanhua Pavilion, where is it? Where is the jade green in the middle of the sky? Birds peck at the green and red mountain fruits, the monk says the yellow and white chrysanthemums bloom. I heard that Tiger Hill can be seen in the distance, I will turn my head back step by step down the mountain."</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Fuqiao's eldest son, Zugeng, was nine years old, his second son, Zucong, was six years old, and his eldest daughter, Minfang, was four years old. The following year, Yi Si, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, Mr. Fuqiao took his children boating on Huilu, and wrote a Five Ancient Verses to record the trip:</p>
<p>"This year, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the sun is warm and the wind is clear, I call my children to eat breakfast and order a boat to leave the north city; Slowly reaching Jiangjian, Huangbu suddenly appears bright; Passing the bridge, I recognize the characters on the pillar, counting the melon sheds through the trees; Looking up at the changing white clouds, looking down at the green water level; One oar changes one scene, discussing and commenting with my children; Before I know it, the Bi Shan mountain appears, already seen in front of me; How soaring are the Nine Dragons? The pagoda rises above the clouds, docking the boat at the foot of Dragon Mountain, the mountain laughs as if welcoming me. ..."</p>
<p>In the year Xuantong Ji You, the first year, he wrote "A Record of the Third Visit to Ren Cao Hermitage," sighing and saying:</p>
<p>"When I brought my son Zugeng to this hermitage for the third time in the first year of Xuantong, the so-called 'jade green in the middle of the sky' had been almost completely cleared away; the halls and buildings were no longer the same as before, making me sigh even more! If Mr. Liang Fen and Rong Ruo have spirits, someone will surely advocate elegance and rebuild this pavilion! I will wait and see."</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, in the year Yi Chou, his brother-in-law Yang Shouzhan Weiyun rebuilt Guanhua Pavilion, setting up a shrine to Liang Fen and Rong Ruo, as well as local sages; Fan Fanshan once wrote a fu (prose-poem) to celebrate it.</p>
<p>In the year Xuantong Xin Hai, the third year, Mr. Fuqiao's third son, Zuxiu, was six years old. He was born with a beautiful appearance, his eyebrows and eyes like a painting. After four years, he contracted a serious illness, lingering in bed for more than a year, and finally passed away, causing endless grief! His farewell verse for his son went:</p>
<p>"Alas, my son's life is entrusted to the dust, there is no way to save him, my face is full of tears; I will take cinnabar as a mark on his arm, may he come to my house again in the next life!" In the summer of that year, the Wang clan genealogy was revised. My maternal grandfather, Jin Cheng Gong, and my two maternal uncles, Fu Bo and Ci Qing, were in charge of the matter, not collecting Ding donations. My maternal grandfather contributed twenty-three yuan, and my two maternal uncles, Fu Bo and Ci Qing, each contributed fifteen yuan.</p>
<p>In the year Minguo Yi Mao, the fourth year, he obtained the calligraphy scroll of his grandfather Duke Wumin, seventy-one years before. He wrote an invitation for poetry:</p>
<p>"Jingrong indulged in seclusion in his early years and took refuge in Zen in his middle age, with his grandfather's style. He was ashamed of Liang Gong's descendants, striving for ambition, and embarrassed by Fubo's grandson, fearing the legacy of both generations. Suddenly, he re-examined his grandfather's old traces. Burning incense to appreciate it, he did not tire of doing it a hundred times, tracing and admiring it, almost ten thousand times. He felt that the structure was rigorous and the spirit was secluded. In the year Jia Chen, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the Stone Spring washed the inkstone, and the fragrance remained on the corner seal. The wild water entered the pond, and he hand-copied the sentence 'Still in his infancy'. From the moment it touched the paper to the signature, there was no deviation, no slackness. It should be treasured forever, how can it be accidental?..."</p>
<p>The following year, Bing Chen, he obtained the calligraphy scroll of his father Duke Minghuan, thirty-six years before. He wrote an invitation for poetry:</p>
<p>"Heaven is too cruel, taking my father away in his prime; Things have their destination, grieving over the relics on the day of return. The sharp edges and corners, the brush rushes like dragons and snakes, the formation is vertical and horizontal, the wrist is like a wind and rain; obtaining the essence of Mi Dian, inheriting the true transmission of Xi Xian. Many beautiful Ci words, the lingering fragrance of twenty-eight sounds has not faded, from Geng Chen to the present, the ink has been new for thirty-six years. Heaven and earth protect and preserve it for a long time, it is unique in the family history, it is the old servant's collection of the Three Buddha Pavilion in Chu, and the supplementary ink of the Yue Ting inscription in Shizhou. ..."</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic of China, there was a Wu Wu draft, in the eighth year, there was a Ji Wei draft, and in the ninth year, there was a Geng Shen draft, all of which have been printed. The Xin You draft and Ren Xu draft are planned to be compiled but not printed. What remains now is "Mountain Travel Showing Cong Er" in Xin You, which has seven ancient styles:</p>
<p>"This year, I have not worn mountain climbing shoes, it is not bad to travel on this day! Chrysanthemums are thin, crabs are fat, new wine is delicious, put it off for another month to make the Double Ninth Festival. ..."</p>
<p>Also, he remembers visiting Ren Cao Hermitage in the rain in the past, using the old rhyme of Jia Chen:</p>
<p>"I used to come to Cao An in the past, suddenly tidying up the cliff, there is no dust; Birds peck at the green and red mountain fruits, the monk says the yellow and white chrysanthemums bloom; The leaky thatched roof is not afraid of thirst, the chestnut garden has a good harvest to warm myself. Pointing to Tiger Hill in the misty rain, I turn my head back step by step down the peak."</p>
<p>In the year Jia Zi, the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he wrote the "Sixty-Year Self-Preface of the Qingniu Daoist," and also wrote four seven-character律詩 (regulated verse) for his own birthday, the first of which said:</p>
<p>"The winter solstice is when the sun is born, I was born then, I dare to say I was blessed by nature! My illnesses often burdened my parents, and my lack of talent is not enough to navigate the world; My father worried during my capping ceremony, and my mother died this year, listening to the sad wind; I pity myself for being lonely and thinking about Yi's teachings, I am ashamed to inherit the past and carry on the future!"</p>
<p>In that year, his eldest sister, Qingfen, died at the age of fifty-eight. Qingfen married Chen Jun of Jiangyin Yijin. After the marriage, she went north to visit her parents-in-law. When she arrived in Yangliuqing, her husband fell ill and died during the journey, she was so saddened that she wanted to die. When she arrived in Beijing, her parents-in-law encouraged her to keep her chastity and adopt a son for her husband. For thirty-six years of hardship, she was fortunate to have her brothers Fu Bo and Ci Qing, their deep family affection was comforting!</p>
<p>In the year Geng Wu, Madam Yang's middle sister, Huanfen, turned sixty. Huanfen married Zhang Yun of Jiangyin, who wrote "Shao Xuan Poetry Collection". Huanfen's matching works included "Remembering Rong Studio Poetry Draft". Two years later, in the year Ren Shen, her third sister Yunfen turned sixty. Mr. Fuqiao wrote a sentence on behalf of the young Madam Pei to congratulate her, saying:</p>
<p>"Setting up a towel is a good time to enjoy the wine, the sisters are separated by Yan Tai; Since we parted, we have been suffering from lovesickness, wanting to reach out and shake hands."</p>
<p>"My sister will be seventy next year, I am happy to see her old and healthy and up to date; I know that the Lai Cai dance is continuous, I envy the heavenly joy of family." At that time, Mr. Fuqiao was sixty-eight years old, and Madam Yang was sixty-seven years old. Liang and Meng were side by side, both near the ancient age of seventy, which was enough to envy the world. Later, Mr. Fuqiao lived to be seventy-five years old, and Madam Yang lived to be seventy-seven years old, living a peaceful and old age, which can be called a fairy couple!</p>
<p>In the year Xin Wei, for the fiftieth anniversary of my late father's death, Mr. Fuqiao wrote:</p>
<p>"Alas! How many years has my brother-in-law Huinong been dead? I still remember my seventh uncle once said to me: 'Huinong has always been enthusiastic about his work and generous in helping others. His deeds cannot be buried. Why don't you write a biography for him to tell his story?' Can I promise? ... Huinong is my sister Qing, and even more so with a marriage connection, how can I not say a word to fulfill my sister Songfen's trust?..."</p>
<p>Gaisheng gave his beloved daughter to my eldest brother Yuqi in marriage, so he was also a relative of my father. The meaning of the writing was not fully expressed, so I ended with a seven-ancient chapter:</p>
<p>"The Hu Tou Men's fortune is now thriving, he should not have died so quickly, my Huinong; The garden is full of jade and the steps are full of orchids, suddenly losing shelter, I grieve for the frosty wind! ... How virtuous is my sister, stopping her tears and rising, I dare not shirk the heavy burden of a thousand catties? I must make sure that the inheritance of one family is continuous, though he is dead in the sky, it is as if he is not dead!..."</p>
<p>Alas! My late father died at the young age of thirty-five. My brothers and I are incapable, and we want to rely on Mr. Fuqiao's poems and essays to pass on to the world. Mr. Fuqiao's nature is calm and indifferent, and he has experienced great changes. Although he is over seventy years old, he still does not want to use poetry and essays to live in the world. Now, my brother and sister-in-law have asked me to organize the surviving drafts and arrange them in chronological order. After thirty years of an orphan's blood and tears, I can finally rely on the poems and essays of the elder to make the Huai Chun Pavilion stand tall under the three lights (sun, moon, and stars), then my father will not be dead! This is also my mother's wish. How dare I not record it with tears.</p>
<p>Respectfully written by Gu Yuxiu of Shenxi Xishan, in the spring of the first Ding Hai year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Scenery (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— Tang Yunyu</p>
<h3>Visiting Mi Fu's Tomb at Helin Temple</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Among the landscapes of Jingkou, Jinshan, Jiaoshan, and Beigushan are the most famous. The author visited them twice last autumn and recorded several poems and paintings to ask for guidance from Mr. Ni Zhuhua, my fellow artist. Mr. Ni said that the Bamboo Forest Temple and Helin Temple in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang have secluded rock sounds and lush trees, which are different from the three mountains; and there is the tomb of Mi Fu Nanggong of the Northern Song Dynasty, which can be used to commemorate. I yearned for it. At the end of last month, after visiting Suzhou, I transferred to Jingjiang and made a half-day trip in a hurry.</p>
<p>Bamboo Forest and Helin are far away from the river. Without climbing high, there is no way to appreciate the beauty of the Yangtze River. This is why the Bamboo Forest Temple has the "Yijiang Pavilion". The Jingkou Landscape Records states: The Mi Fu Temple is on the left of Helin Temple. Today, I came here with Mr. Zhu to explore. The temple has collapsed and there is no trace. I only saw a pile of yellow earth, the artist's resting place. The stele is still there. Examining its text, it records the beginning and end of the repair of the tomb by Lian Guoshi Ji Mi Wanzhong in the Ming Dynasty. Mi Yuanzhang loved the landscapes of Jingjiang so much that he chose to live here when he was alive and was buried here after he died. The inscriptions on the stele are from Chen Jiru Meigong's handwriting, which is especially precious. I and Mr. Zhu lingered under it, unable to bear to leave. I imagined Nanggong's obsession with mountains, and it is appropriate that his paintings were excellent, the crown of the Northern Song Dynasty. His person and his affairs can be called a good story in the art world for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Nanggong's calligraphy is one of the four great masters of the Song Dynasty, the so-called Su, Huang, Mi, and Cai. Nanggong has a unique charm of dragons flying and phoenixes dancing. His paintings are misty and ethereal, forming a unique style, which is regarded as the master of an era. However, not many of his works have been handed down, especially landscapes. According to the "Picture Witness Records", "Zhi Ji", "Xuanhe Painting Spectrum" and other painting histories, there are only a few works such as "Haiyu Temple Picture", "Small Landscape", and "Yuande Empress's Lost Shoe Circle", in which the trees are shaded, the layers are clear, and the figures, pavilions, houses, bridges, fishing boats, etc. are extremely delicate. I am afraid that they are no longer in the world. I have seen the authentic Nanggong "Spring Mountain Rui Pine Picture" collected by the Palace Museum. It is a colored paper, about one foot and two inches high and one foot and six inches wide. The pines are graceful, with varying shades of color. There is a grass pavilion under the pine. The brushwork of the whole picture is extremely simple and ancient. The distant peaks are divided into main and subordinate, the moss is dotted with Mi points, the clouds are filled with clouds, the artistic conception is rich and thick, and a little light red is applied, with green, calm and powerful, which is completely different from those who use thick brush and wet ink to imitate Mi in later generations.</p>
<p>However, Yuanzhang loved to make ink plays. He did not use a brush exclusively for painting, or used paper tendons, or used sugarcane dregs, or used lotus houses, and waved them at will without any restraint. The paper did not use sizing alum, and he did not use a brush on silk. Therefore, his excitement came with the pen, and the artistic conception was full. Drawing on raw paper is easy to collect the interest of ink halo changes. It can be seen that Yuanzhang's ink play is not as woven as "Haiyue Temple Picture", etc., and the imitation of later generations is all here and not there.</p>
<p>Yuanzhang's paintings were passed down by his son Youhong Huer, who was known as Xiao Mi in the world. He decorated the clouds and mist, kept the family law and was able to maintain his innocence. Among the Yuan people after him, Gao Kegong Fangshan specialized in learning Yuanzhang, and his achievements were so exquisite that he was unparalleled for a time. Fang Congyi Fangzhi, a Taoist, devoted himself to the two Mi, and was unrestrained and refined, entering the realm of extraordinary. Chen Baiyang's landscape paintings in the Ming Dynasty also participated in the Mi family method. Although Dong Siweng did not specialize in learning the two Mi, he had a lot of Nanggong's breath, using Shixiu Runwen Jie, becoming a late Ming Dynasty Jijiu. After the Qing Dynasty, there were no lack of Mi students, all of whom lost their horizontal and vertical lines. The Mi school of landscape painting has almost become a lingering sound in Guangling!</p>
<p>Writer Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Chesterton</h3>
<p>— Zhongqi</p>
<p>The British writer G. K. Chesterton was chatting with a few friends one evening when they asked each other what kind of books they would like to have with them if they were left on a desert island.</p>
<p>"The Complete Works of Shakespeare," one writer said without hesitation.</p>
<p>"I choose the Bible," another inserted.</p>
<p>"What about you?" someone asked Chesterton.</p>
<p>"I would choose..." Chesterton replied, "The Shipbuilding Guide by Tom Si."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 506</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>When Tsurumi saw this uninvited guest, he was smiling and standing in the middle of the room. But he had never seen this stranger before, and he couldn't help but be stunned. Especially surprising to him was that no one in Shanghai knew he was Tsurumi except for a few friends who had come to visit. Moreover, the visitor used the Japanese pronunciation "猪玀米" for the name "Tsurumi". And this pronunciation, if said in the Shanghai dialect by a Northerner, would have some deliberately playful meaning. Although Tsurumi was stunned at the time, he understood this playful meaning; because when they were young, when the author was in Japanese elementary school, the author had told him the Shanghai pronunciation and meaning of his name, and often shouted out this tone to joke with him.</p>
<p>Tsurumi should have been a little angry at this visitor for making fun of him like this, whether intentional or unintentional; but he couldn't bring himself to be angry: What was the reason? Because at first glance, her voice was sweet and crisp, and she herself looked just as sweet and crisp; her cheeks were like two small apples, and her round big eyes fully revealed the girl's coquettishness; she wore two small braids, one hanging behind, and the other stubbornly supporting itself in front, which made her even more mischievous. In Tsurumi's eyes, she was probably only sixteen years old or so.</p>
<p>Just under this brief glimpse, the scene of his first meeting with Ji Yaoqun five or six years ago suddenly touched Tsurumi's mind. In other words, the small shadow of this girl in front of him and Ji Yaoqun five or six years ago were exactly the same: both were healthy and beautiful, both were lively, both were innocent. The only difference was that Yaoqun showed a full of depression in his demeanor under the evil forces of the Japanese invaders in the Northeast, while this girl had a face full of giggling and mischief.</p>
<p>"Oh!..." At this time, Tsurumi's emotions were probably a mixture of surprise, doubt, astonishment, bizarreness, plus a trace of curiosity, and a little bit of wishful thinking. This mixed feeling made Tsurumi, who had been through the storms and had a broad mind, a little confused: His mouth, which was usually eloquent and able to speak eloquently, was now so dull that he couldn't say a word, as if half of his tongue had been cut off.</p>
<p>In his journey of life for the past twenty years or so, he had a Kikuko, but she was like a sister, and there was no need for a man to deal with a woman in a special way. When he met Yaoqun that day, Tsurumi was thinking deeply and planning a secret organization, seeking talents eagerly; moreover, although he was not high in the General Staff Headquarters at that time, his potential power was not small; for Yaoqun, it was a situation of sympathy and assistance, and the situation and ability could also lift heavy things lightly, so the posture of dealing with Yaoqun was extremely frank and natural, although it was inevitable that a little bit of male and female feelings were mixed in. Tsurumi didn't feel any difficulty in dealing with it.</p>
<p>Later, when he met Pingzi in Tokyo, Tsurumi was ready to bet everything and had long put life and death out of his mind. In dealing with Pingzi, there was only the distinction between enemy and friend, and there was no distinction between men and women, so he didn't feel any difficulty in dealing with her. When he was attacked by the imposter Kawashima Yoshiko in Beiping, Tsurumi's imagination was completely "soldiers come to block, water comes to earth", and he didn't care whether the other party was a woman or a man.</p>
<h3>Unpleasant Pleasantry</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>On the way back from victory and demobilization, on a steamer from Hankou to Nanjing, I witnessed an unpleasant "pleasantry."</p>
<p>In my cabin, there were over a dozen bunks, men and women mixed together. My family occupied five bunks, and I was on the edge. Across from me was a middle-aged woman and an infant. Once, I saw this woman changing the infant's diaper. When she unfolded the diaper, what caught my attention was a large patch of red. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a Japanese flag. This flag was small, used as a diaper. The red sun was perfectly positioned to receive the infant's buttocks, not too big, not too small, as if custom-made. I blurted out! "Ah! It's a Japanese flag!" The woman said triumphantly, "Yes! His father brought it back from the front line. There are many, and I'm using them as diapers!" She flipped open the quilt to show me, and indeed there were several pieces. I looked at the one she had taken off, a pile of yellow feces right in the center of the red sun, the sides soaked in urine. I shook my head and sighed. The woman became even more proud, saying, "We suffered under them for decades. Today, it's time to turn the tables (turning the tables means revenge, not sure if this is the correct writing, to be verified.) and vent some anger! Hahahaha." I joined her with a "Hahahaha." Another person nearby said, "It's indeed a pleasantry!"</p>
<p>I remembered: Before the war of resistance, when Japan invaded China, the Chinese people hated Japan. Some even cursed the Japanese flag as a menstrual cloth. They said, "Among the world's flags, the Japanese one is the easiest to make. When a Japanese woman menstruates, she uses a handkerchief to block her genitals. The next day, she pulls it out, and the red circle in the center of the handkerchief becomes the national flag." Although this curse was vicious, it was just talk. Now, using the Japanese flag as a diaper is actually being put into practice. This is truly a "pleasantry!" But I feel so unpleasant!</p>
<p>This kind of behavior is too atrocious! It's like a hooligan cursing someone, or a mischievous child playing a prank. The past Japanese were indeed extremely atrocious. But how can we be like them? An ancient saying goes: "Do not dwell on old wrongs, thus resentment will be rare." A common saying: "Enmities should be resolved, not created." Now that they have surrendered, we should forget old wrongs. Only then can we show our character and maintain world peace. That's why I felt unpleasant after seeing that "pleasantry," because it is related to our character and hinders the future of world peace.</p>
<p>But later I thought again: Menstrual blood and urine, from a scientific point of view, are no different from saliva and mucus, with no distinction between high and low, noble and base. If everyone in the world viewed it that way, then it wouldn't matter. May 7, Year 36.</p>

<h3>A Small Drink in Chang'an</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>Tai Bai's Drinking Place</p>
<p>The Eight Immortals Temple outside Xiaodongmen is said to be where Lü Dongbin met Han Zhongli; the initial motivation for building the temple was based on the popular mythology of the Eight Immortals. The incense is still thriving, and on good days in spring and autumn, women from the countryside flock to it. A few steps east of here, there is a large stone tablet, deeply engraved with the five characters "Tai Bai's Drinking Place"; next to it is a thatched shed with several rows of low-legged benches. An old man tends a pot and sells rice wine; it is said that his family has been doing this for generations, for nearly a hundred years. The wine is sweet and mellow, suitable for drinking by the bowl, but it is quite potent; the wine referred to as "Tai Bai's斗酒" belongs to this category. The area around the Eight Immortals Temple is already a remote part of the suburbs, yet gentlemen and ladies still flock to it, as if startled, because this old man's rice wine is truly a unique delicacy in Guanzhong.</p>
<p>Chicken Shreds and Wax Meat</p>
<p>Wax meat is a special method of curing and smoking pork; the meat is in the shape of a disk, with red and white colors contrasting, extremely cooked and tender; using it to pair with wine is infinitely flavorful. It is sold everywhere in the market of Chang'an, with various small shops and stalls, but the best is sold by a butcher shop in Jisi Guai in Dongguan. There are three or four butcher shops in Jisi Guai, and the one referred to here is the tall-doored one on the south side of the road. Many of Chang'an's famous small drinking places have no names, and the scenery of the old capital is naturally different.</p>
<p>Old Ma's Waxed Mutton</p>
<p>The Northwest is a base for Muslims, and halal signs are displayed everywhere in the market. The cooking of beef and mutton is quite exquisite.</p>
<p>Waxed mutton is similar in nature to ordinary cured beef, with a slight taste of soy-braised meat, but it has a unique method and a world of its own; it can be called a fine product for pairing with wine in the cool autumn weather.</p>
<p>The most exquisite production and sale is by "Old Ma's"; however, there are many imitations, such as "Old Old Ma's," "Genuine Old Ma's," like the Wang Mazi scissors shop in Beijing, confusing people and making it difficult to distinguish the real from the fake. An insider told me that the one at the east entrance of Zhuba Market on West Street is more refined; and the quality of the finished product depends less on the chef's skill and more on whether the person buying the raw meat has sharp eyes; it is necessary to study what kind of mutton is suitable for making fine products.</p>
<p>Zhuba Market Mutton Soup Restaurant</p>
<p>In the Northwest, steamed buns are commonly called "馍 (mo)," and "泡 (pao)" means to soak; therefore, "羊肉泡馍 (yangrou paomo)" is a dish of steamed buns soaked in mutton soup. This kind of mutton soup is made from sheep's head, trotters, liver, mutton, etc., stewed into a "whole sheep fresh soup"; it must be added with a little chili to enhance the flavor and to suppress the fishy smell.</p>
<p>The steamed buns are made from pure flour and without any other ingredients. When soaking, the diner first tears it into small pieces, and then asks the waiter to take it away and add soup; if it is cut with a knife, it is feared that the soup will not easily penetrate.</p>
<p>It is said that the most famous mutton soup restaurant is the one at the south entrance of Zhuba Market.</p>

<h3>Chaplin to Create New Type of Film</h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin told reporters in New York on the 9th that he intends to create a new type of film that will be popular around the world, like his past silent films.</p>
<p>Chaplin now intends to eliminate subtitles and sound inserts in his new film, and replace them with explanations of actions and dialogues in the audience's native language. When the narrator speaks, the actor's voice should be faded. It is said that in his new film "Monsieur Verdoux," there are large sections of dialogue that cannot be translated into subtitles. Unless the audience understands English, they will lose the entire effect. This new method is the third and final stage of Chaplin's artistic evolution.</p>
<h3>How to Solve the Rice Crisis</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Following the rice frenzy in Hangzhou, Wujin and Suzhou also experienced rice rush, and unexpectedly Shanghai could not escape this exception. On the 7th, civilians rushed for rice, and on the 8th, rice merchants beat people and damaged shops.</p>
<p>The rice merchants' suffering has its root causes, but the civilians' shop smashing and rice snatching was originally motivated by temporary indignation and was not intentional. Now, the rice merchants are not settling the matter fairly, but retaliating with action, gathering crowds under the guise of petitioning, beating people and destroying shops, stepping into the legal net. Not only will those who previously sympathized with the rice shops being beaten feel cold, but even the government will find it difficult to protect this action as legal. Mayor Wu's reply to the rice industry representatives is telling. The rice merchants are digging their own graves, which is deeply regrettable!</p>
<p>For the current plan: Although rice merchants have police officers protecting the sale of rationed rice, in my opinion, this is not thorough enough. The best solution is to temporarily nationalize all rice shops in the city, concentrate the rice and grain in the hands of the government, plan as a whole, or immediately implement grain distribution based on population, supervised by district chiefs in conjunction with local gentry, institutions, factories, schools, and public educators, supervised by their superiors or responsible persons; In this way, rice merchants can clear the accusation of being "rice worms", the government can try out the distribution policy, and the people can trust the government's supply of "people's food."</p>
<p>On the contrary, if civilians beat shops today and rice merchants beat people tomorrow, there will be endless entanglements and no peaceful days. Those in politics in Shanghai will not have time to handle other affairs and will have to focus on "mediation" and "suppression" every day. If it spreads abroad, it will be discussed that Shanghai has degenerated to a barbaric period. I hope the government will adopt this.</p>
<h3>Play Onstage and Play Offstage</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>Quite by chance, I watched Peking opera, which I hadn't watched for a long time, and it was Tong Zhiling's "best show" – Spinning Cotton.</p>
<p>This play has been popular for a long time. I remember it was once banned, supposedly because its content was "too that way." At the same time, as soon as the ban was issued, the play became even more popular, and Tong Zhiling's name was established both inside and outside the opera world. It is said that recently she nets more than 800,000 for each time she spins cotton. This time, she performed at the Tianchan Stage for 36 days, with a contracted salary of 80 million, which shows how popular her performances are!</p>
<p>I feel that the "劲 (jin - vigor)" in Tong Zhiling's performance is certainly not the right path for art, but it is not as terrible as some frivolous people say. It's just that the audience is too "sensitive." They are used to associating a "cherry mouth" with a certain part of a woman's body, just like when reading "Jin Ping Mei (金瓶梅)", the sound of Pan Jinlian calling "Dada" will uncontrollably make them "longing in their hearts."</p>
<p>To be honest, sitting there, I didn't find anything surprising or strange about Tong Zhiling's performance onstage. What I found curious was the play being performed by the audience offstage. A young man in his twenties from the foreign settlement, when he was absorbed in watching, seemed to be flowing with an expression that he couldn't suppress, and he unconsciously beamed, gaped, sighed, and shouted for joy in a strange voice. There was also an old man in his fifties sitting in the row in front of me, who, while watching Tong Zhiling, said solemnly, "What kind of play is this! It's outrageous!" If it weren't for the fact that we were in the theater, he would have burst out in a torrent of abuse, as if nothing less would be enough to suppress his anger. Shaking his head, scoffing, and waving his sleeves were still considered polite. However, I thought: Maybe this gentleman wanted to use this to stabilize his own "chaste" heart?</p>
<p>It was originally an insignificant play, but there were so many viewers, and there were so many faces and psychologies of such viewers, one kind of fluttering and carefree frivolity, and another kind of terrifying seriousness. So I had the above observations and expressed them, even if it is a kind of "scene" in the opera world.</p>

<h3>Dagger Behind a Smile</h3>
<p>— Zikai</p>
<p>The other day, a newspaper published a special dispatch from Beiping, saying that there was a drama evening during Peking University's May Fourth Commemoration Week. When "A Woman and a Dog" was performed, someone went on stage to question: It is clearly a human, why is it titled "A Dog"? When another play, "Triumph," was staged, the audience was moved to tears because of the play's tragic and indignant plot. However, one person applauded and laughed loudly, causing public outrage, and they wanted to beat him severely, which was stopped only after mediation. After reading these two things, I really find them humorous. It's like in the legend, when Cao Cao is performed on stage, someone wants to drag him down and whip him. If this were used in humorous writing, it could be considered excellent. The stage and the audience becoming one, which originally showed how deeply moving the drama was, is a good thing. In modern drama, there are even special cases where the audience becomes the actors. However, the above two situations are another matter.</p>
<p>A play titled "A Woman and a Dog" is originally a kind of humor, but unfortunately, the person watching the play took it seriously. Although this matter itself is more humorous than the drama, at that time it was not humorous at all. Conversely, another play was probably a tragedy, so the people watching it took it seriously and shed tears of sympathy. However, when the audience was unanimously in tears, one person alone felt a sense of humor and applauded and laughed loudly. This bit of humor he revealed was unbearable to the serious majority, which aroused public outrage and they wanted to beat him severely. Imagining that time, this humorous spectator would not be able to continue being humorous.</p>
<p>Looking at these two things together, we get the impression that the current society has lost its normalcy. Abnormal things are constantly happening. Taking a humorous play seriously to the point of going on stage to question is abnormal; everyone being sad and crying while someone applauds and laughs loudly is also abnormal. Someone applauding and laughing loudly while the crowd is enraged and wants to beat them severely is also abnormal. Another impression is the inability to tolerate each other. Humorous people ridicule the serious, and serious people cannot tolerate humor. The latter is especially a common problem in the current world. The last impression is the collapse of customs and traditions. The spectator going on stage to question is a clear example. Perhaps my words are not clear enough. But we can all see that there is a trend right now that is overthrowing everything, good and bad, indiscriminately, creating a kind of chaos. This is not a revolution, but it is worth everyone's vigilance. We must at least save those things that are worth leaving behind.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The battle for the seat next to the driver began fiercely.</p>
<p>Almost everyone who was sitting on the driver's platform was immediately driven down, and Lan and Feifei were no exception.</p>
<p>"Isn't anyone allowed to sit here?" Zhang Chang was not convinced. He rushed over first, staring at the tall, thin driver who was yelling at Lan and Feifei to get off the truck, and questioned him loudly.</p>
<p>"No one is allowed to sit here! What are you going to do about it?" The driver squinted his eyes, lowered his face, and replied arrogantly.</p>
<p>Zhang Chang, full of youthful energy, was about to fight this arrogant driver.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, you really are a child!" Lan had already jumped down from the driver's platform and stopped Zhang Chang with a smile. "I didn't want to sit here in the first place. Wouldn't it be more lively if everyone sat in the back?"</p>
<p>Zhang Chang glared angrily and clenched his fists, staring at the driver. Although the driver was even more arrogant than him, he saw that the person who had occupied the seat was so polite and had already taken the initiative to get off the truck, so he didn't want to make trouble. He just snorted in his nose and hurriedly turned around to greet another short, fat woman with many large and small packages in her hands to get on the truck. He was afraid that if this money-paying customer didn't get on the truck, the seats Lan and Feifei had given up might be occupied by someone even more ruthless or with a bigger background.</p>
<p>"Sisi, play with Uncle Zhang! I'll go up to the truck and take a look first." Lan was as calm as if nothing had happened, and handed Feifei to Zhang Chang – in order to prevent him from fighting with the tall, thin driver again – and then happily climbed to the back of the truck.</p>
<p>The driver's seats of the other four trucks had already become a mess.</p>
<p>Zhang Chang, his anger still not extinguished, held Feifei's hand, still standing in place, staring wide-eyed at the driver and the fat woman who was getting on the truck.</p>
<p>"I'll do it, I'll do it!" The tall, thin driver was fawning with a smile, taking care of his big customer, rushing to put her many packages away, and even folding his old clothes and pressing them on the wooden plank as a cushion.</p>
<p>"Damn it! I don't know how much money he took!" Zhang Chang thought in his head.</p>
<p>But just as the driver was about to help his big customer get on the truck, something disappointing happened. A flurry of high-top leather boots came from the left. The one walking in the front was the young Director Xiong. Behind him was a thin man in his middle age wearing a very exquisite suit, holding a very elaborate cane. On the right was a woman who was half his age and not very beautiful. In the back were a high-ranking military officer wearing an eagle crown and a sword, and two orderlies carrying a few simple pieces of small and exquisite luggage.</p>
