<p>「中央社保定三十日電」平保間洽安日趨鞏固，刻定興逐縣附近，已無大股匪軍，路局在軍事順利進展下，客車已通至固城，至保北上軍，已通漕河，徐水漕河間，仍有匪軍活動，搶修不便，刻國軍已派部隊出動，掃藝該地殘匪，平保不久可通車。</p>
<h3>魯西國軍績挻進　皖北匪渡沙河向西南逃竄</h3>
<p>「本翻徐州卅日電」金鄕魚台地區已無匪蹤，國軍正向單縣城武挺進。皖北國軍續向沈邱界首之匪啣尾追剿，陳匪一，三，四。六縱隊殘部渡沙河向西南逃竄</p>

<h3>外匯政策　最近不變動</h3>
<p>「本報南京卅日電」關於外匯政策，外間近有種種傳說，記者今走訪某經濟權咸人士，據談：外匯政策最近不致有何變動，渠分析其中原因稱：有人曾主張實行全面開放政策，聽任市場決定其價格，實行開放時，市價可能大漲一次，就理論上言，其後反可能逐漸下跌，惟政府方面不願冒此大險，蓋恐一旦全面開放，致一發而不可收抬。目前每日公布牌價，雖非妥善之策，但亦非最壊辦法，物價之漲，亦係徐徐而升，故外匯政策近期內將不致有何變動。</p>
<h3>遠經會我代表發表重要聲明　贊成設各種專題委會</h3>
<p>「中央社碧瑤廿九日電」亞洲遠東經濟委員會會議廿九日討論其方法及職權問題。中國代表李榦代表中國政府，就此問題發表重要聲明稱：該會議不能處理此一區域內人民所盼望之問題，因其並非工作團體，然亞洲及遠東國家經濟上之種種需要，必須由此一委員會，提交經社理事會，聯合國之其他機構，以及聯合國之會員國，始能獲得優先之考慮並採取行動。李氏指出，會議應集中其努力於若干重要問題，庶幾能於合理之時間內，完成其分析及建議。李氏於其聲明中贊成在亞洲及遠東經濟委員會內設置各種專題委員會之意見，並極力建議該會不必等待委員會機構之完成，而可立即開始擬定若干經濟建設方面之建議。此項建議係以可以獲得之原料爲根據者，李幹　成委員會秘書處所提之建議，該建議主張設置商品委員會，俾各國分配供應稀少之商品時，易於獲得協議。李榦並建議在該委員會之下，設置建設委員會，此委員會當於下屆亞洲暨遠東區經濟委員會會議之各國代表中應有處理建設事宜之政府官員。至於交換經濟情報問題，李氏請委員會注意兩點：　西方國家之統計標準，不能適用於遠東地區之大部份地方，故有關實施之政策及措施，有時將必須依據大概之數字決定之。　亞洲及遠東區經濟委員會雖非從事實際工作之機構，然必須嚴防使其化爲學院性質之機構或超級研究組織。吾人必須工作，俾亞洲及遠東方面之人民，他日得能有更佳而更豐富之生活。</p>
<h3>印尼入會問題將再提出討論</h3>
<p>「中央社碧瑤廿九日電」印尼與會問題，下週將在遠東經濟委員會中再度提出，預料將再請考慮中國之建議，即對荷關與印尼分別請求取得贊助會員國之資格一案，予以延期考慮。該建議已經六票對四票（並無棄權）表決通過。</p>

<p>「又電」平潘直達軍原定一日開駛，惟因故尙有待。</p>
<h3>國民黨員競選應遵提名原則　中央黨部電所屬注意</h3>
<p>「本報南京卅日電」國民黨中央黨都已決定通電各省市黨部：「凡本黨同志應絕對遵守政黨提名原則，否則縱當選，亦屬無效」。按各省市黨部執行此項命令時，開將依據政黨提名辦法，將所有未經中央圈定提名之黨員或圈定提名候補之黨員，而自由競選後常選爲正式者，由黨部通知各該選舉事務所，撤消其提名，又據中央負責人談話。廿八白國務會議通過國府委員鄒魯等之提案，國府不日即將令知選舉總事務所云。</p>
<h3>參加地方參議會兩黨名額待續商</h3>
<p>「本報訊」民青兩黨參加各省市參議會事，原則上雖早經洽妥，但技術上尙需商榷。因當初洽商結果，兩黨可提出五分之一之名額，但如照各地參議會現數提出此百分率，則參加後即爲總數之六分之一，而非五分之一。當時商談之際，初未注意此點，惟因此事將影響未來監委之名額，故兩黨要求續作洽商。</p>
<p>「本報濟南卅日電」濟記者公會迭電政府，以山東係綏靖區域記者國代選舉與已完全復員省市共列東區，太不公平，請改歸北區及保留各縣市未復員記者公會選舉權。省市議會亦同樣主張，但迄無結果，特聲明放棄選權。</p>
<p>「本報成都卅日電」滬方傳靑年黨在川競選，多人被暗殺事，此間官方毫無所悉。</p>
<h3>中空運協定明日開始實施　港穗滬綫飛行班機</h3>
<p>「本報南京卅日電」中·英空中運輸協定簽字後，現已開始實施，英國香港航空公司，決自十二月二日起開航港·穗·滬綫，規定每星期二·四·六往返於香港·上海，每星期三·五往返於贗州·上海，廣州·香港間則每日往返三次，惟爲保護我國幼稚之航空事業起見，滬。港間旅客每週不得超過五十位，至遠程航綫現正申請飛行手續中，英國由海外航空公司担任，我由中國航空公司担任，不久即可開始。</p>
<h3>國際郵資加價　今日起增三分之一</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕交通部郵政總局頃發公吿，金佛郞與國幣之比價，由一比一八〇〇〇，調整爲一比二四○〇〇元。國際郵資自本年十二月一日起，照現行資例增三分之一，尾數不滿千元者，進爲千元，包裹暫按現行資例加五倍，尾數亦進爲千元，寄美航包航空費每公斤六十一萬元。</p>
<h3>當局決以政治力量　謀迅速抑平物價　某負責人談暴漲兩因素</h3>
<p>「本報南京卅日電」當局應付當前暴漲之物價，決以政治力量處理，以謀迅速抑平。某負責人士卅日語記者時，曾强調此點，渠稱：物價問題可分二方面，一爲經濟的因素，此係目前必然現象。另一爲人的因素，月前之狂漲，人爲的因素成份居多，故政府決以政洽力量處理。</p>
<h3>暹發生政變後華僑情況安謐　黎立柔等抵京表示</h3>

<h3>對日和約談判僵持　馬卿擬進行私人懇談以謀打開　蘇方建議目的不外拖延</h3>
<p>「聯合社華盛頓廿九日電」蘇聯提出四强制定對日和約之要求，今日已使美國發起解決對日和約四個月來之努力爲之阻塞。繼續與太平洋其他盟國談判與否，當視是否需要蘇聯參加而定，目前尚未有所決定。外交界人士預料，馬歇爾國務狠可能在現行四外長會議中經由與蘇外長莫洛托夫及與英外相貝文私人懇談之方式，扛開僵局。在馬卿提出報吿或倫敦四外長結束前，談判局勢將僵持如故。</p>
<p>「聯合社埃沃瓦州格林納爾卅日電」中國駐美大使顧維鈞，昨在格林納爾墨院國際時事研究所發表演說，謂蘇聯已使日本和約早日締結之機會受阻，截至現在爲止，朝鮮獨立之機構已被妨礙。顧氏暗示，條聯正在中國內戰中援助中共，並謂中國需要援助，爲世界和平計，援助愈早愈佳。遠東問題實與歐洲問題同樣重要，華北及東北之共產黨，並不完全脫離外國方面之思想及援助</p>
<p>「中央社東京廿九日電」此間英·美人士俱信，蘇聯致中國照會所建議明年一月四外長在中國召開特別會議，倘初步討論對日和約一事，乃表示蘇聯仍決定　可能拖延簽訂和約。</p>
<p>「路透社倫敦廿九日電」今日之外長會議中，兩次述及遠東和約，使人益信莫洛托夫將使德·日和約樹立聯繁，莫洛托夫今日反對設立德國區政府之意見時，曾謂：整個德國，整個歐洲，整個世界包括日本在內，均急需和平，此語乃係表示蘇聯將要求加速舉行對日和約討論之先聲，且若許德國政府，在盟國議定對德和約前參加製造和約之工作，將爲一重要之先例，使日於製訂遠東和約時，亦得耍求類似之權。</p>
<h3>美前駐外大使十二人　聯名促軍事援華　致電兩院外委會及馬卿</h3>
<p>「聯合社紐約廿九日電」美國前駐外大使十二人廿九日聯名致電參·衆兩院外交委員會及國務卿馬歇爾，呼　發軍事設備及財政經濟援助中國。電文中稱：予等認爲，中國若落在蘇聯支配之下，美國重要利益將遭受嚴重威脅，故力請君等與中國政府以必要之軍事設備及財政經濟援助。此電書名渚爲前駐波籣大使貝林，前駐蘇大使薄立特，前駐智利大使柯利亞，前駐墨西哥大使但尼爾，前駐巴拉圭大使富洛斯，前駐德大使史洛特，前駐巴拿馬大使期巴士，前駐挪威大使　斯朋，前駐義大利大使菲立普，前駐土耳其大使史基納，前駐蘇大使史丹萊，前駐西班牙大使魏德爾。</p>
<p>「中央社舊金山卅日常」無黨派之西雅圖時報，今日力促華感頓州之國會代表支持紐約州長杜威之要求，即立即援華，並促衆院外交委員會建蹤美金六千萬元臨時對華援助。該報社論標題爲：「不應遺忘中國」，對杜魯門對國會咨文中並未提及中國，表示遣憾。對社威要求將中國列入美國對外援助計劃之內，則表示讚揚。並稱：「如杜魯門及其顧問已忽視中國之迫切需要及其對西半球與西方文化之重要性，則太平洋北岸之美國人民並未忽視保留中國爲潛在之民主國家之一，對吾人本身之經濟及政治前途，意義極爲深刻，故一般人欲將中國列入救濟計劃中，情緒異常强烈。本州國會代表對衆院外委會爲中國所提出之關於援外計劃之修正案，應率先支持。」</p>

<p>「本報濟南廿八日航訊」直到現在，作爲魯共在膠東最大根據地的「三山」（即平度東北的大澤山，　霞東南的鋸齒牙山，牟平東南的崑嵛山。前者一度由國軍全部收復，鋸齒牙山一部亦經國軍一度收復）。雖始終尙在共匪硬紮困守之中，由於共匪土八路在實力上遠超過國軍的地方團隊，以游擊戰爲主的土八路配合上以運動戰爲主的共匪正規軍第二，七，九，及十三等四個縱隊及第四縱隊之一部，趁國軍一部於底定膠交後陸續南調的空隙，先後發動攻勢，竄入了掖縣，平度，膠縣，壽光，　昌邑東南范家集之役後，並又發動了進窺高密的包圍攻勢，然在國軍機動遝用，靈活作戰下，在若干小戰鬥中，共匪雖亦多少與些小便宜，但在戰術上，尤其戰略上，龍口，烟台，威海衛等要港的佔領，廖東大部城鎭的收復，遮斷了魯共的國際聯絡錢，减削了魯共壯丁和食糧的來源，使共匪深感「糧食因難」，「沒鞋沒衣沒　子」，到頭來終於迎陳毅的副手粟裕也不得不發出「反攻，反攻，掉了山東」－的悲鳴。其作戰情緒的普遍低落，失敗意識的廣泛加深，從　　就不難想見了</p>
<p>不過，若千重要點綫的佔領，絕不能視作「山東戰事已是尾聲的尾擊」。魯共土八路在今天仍有九十六個　之多，過去中央對山柬　　成立十六個保安團，而事賞上中央過去一年來命山東撥捕國軍正規重的竟達廿八個團，這使王　武兼主席在千辛萬苦中所重建的地主武力，結果都成了國軍，而遠背「槍不離人，人不離鄉，及不脫齜生產」的固有原則，因此，就　東言，若干非戰略要點的城鎭，便不得不暫行自動忍痛放棄。</p>
<p>要做到人民能順利復員還鄉，及以組織對組織，首先就要能做到以武力對武力。國軍的正規軍對付共開的野戰軍各縱隊雖綽有餘裕，但假使不使政府的地方團隊培植到足可對付共匪的土八路，那就等於只有一隻脚的跛子，在作戰時是無法得心應手，運用自如的。目下繼續在組訓中的山東地方武力約有卅個團。</p>
<p>魯南及魯中沂蒙山區於共匪撤退時，雖也一樣經其破壊，其中沂蒙山區往往百十里不見人烟，不見一完屋，野草長得比樹還要長，遠比往年贛南瑞金，寗都還要慘，但這種種，還都算不得什麼，假使你到魯西南的　城，鉅野，金鄉，城武，魚台，單縣，曹縣等地去遊歷一下，那就無異　弔今之占戰場。這裏縣城的失守，至少在四次以上，普通是六七次，最多的是鄲城，前後計達九次之多，魯省府所委的縣長，其中三位戰死，兩位被俘，最近的一位也因不勝繁苦，要求吿退，因此在山東當縣長，一般都視作「候補烈士」。現在在魯西市收復區裏，小到運找一張桌子，一隻凳子，也困對到萬分，原因是這些於經歷無數次「拉鋸戰」中，早被赤匪用來常柴燒了。駐軍和老百姓一樣，都是席地而坐，席地而臥，在破磚殘瓦斷　頹壁旁搭些草棚，藉避風雨。若干復員的小學校，亦只可露天講學，畫地設敎。</p>
<p>由於魯西南是國軍底定魯中和膠東後陳毅劉伯承唯一對魯北冀南的交通總匯，因此，這裏便也成了他們最重要的補給　地，在匪是勢在必守，而在國軍爲配合今後對中原共匪的園剿計劃，這裏也就成了「攻其所必守」了！</p>
<p>黃河冰凍後，對共匪於物資補給兵力調動上多少可護若干便利。因此，若干人士已在開始顧慮共匪會不會繼石家莊之後，對濟南來一次句　攻勢？這經記者向有關方面探詢結果，一致認爲可能性甚少。</p>
<p>但誠如王耀武司令官向本報記者說：「我們已開始對兵力，裝備及食糧，作最積極的準備，城防工事，亦已加强，我們應做到如孫子所云：「勿　敵之不來，恃我有所以待」。」</p>

<h3>蘇聯答覆我國建議以後　再論對日和約預備會議</h3>
<p>我國政府為調合美蘇對日和約程序的意見，特於十一月十七日向英美蘇三國照會，建　對日和約預備會議，由遠東委員會各會員國組織，四强則保留否決權。本報十一月二十一日社評，曾指出這個建議於倫敦外長會議期內提出，說明對日和約程序問題雖巳陷入僵局。仍然是有路可走，中國的建議富有妥協性，在折衷美蘇意見和尊重其他八國地位的意義上，實為合理的具有建設性的方案。許多國家的輿論，與我們的觀察相同，希望相同，期待着美蘇的切實答覆。現在蘇聯的答覆，巳於十一月二十八日提出，似與我國建議可能接近，但與美國意見則大相徑庭。英美兩國國論發出各種不同的反響，英美兩個政府對中蘇兩照會，迄今尙無正式表示。這個僵局究将如何打開？一般人感到難於臆測。</p>
<p>蘇聯政府答覆我國政府的照會，性質上又是一種建議，惟堅決主張對日和約由四强外長會商，拒絕遠東委員會十一國會商，仍未變更其以往的立塲。蘇聯答覆與我國比較接近的，祗是四强否決權的維持；蘇聯答覆與我國建議所未協商一致的，乃是遠東委員會的共同會商問題。蘇聯建議應為我國所歡迎的，是對日和約預備會應在中國舉行，時間為明年一月。所以我們說，中蘇意見較前總算接近了一步，但並未完全接近。在英美看來，蘇聯建議並非新的意見，它依然是中英美三國意見得修正，所以華盛頓的消息表示冷淡。綜括四國態度和立塲，關於對日和約預備會議召開問題，現在產生了三種不同的方案，僵局似乎更進入複雜，並無消弭或简化的徵象。英美態度立塲凝成一個方案，中蘇又各持一個方案。會議地點和時間，似乎關係很小。三個方案不同的爭點，仍在四國或十一國召集和起草問題，與夫四國否決權應否維持的問題。這是和會程序之爭，也是大國權利之爭。我們關切這個問題，願再申論意見如次：</p>
<p>第一，四國或十一國召集起草問題。　我們同意政府的主張，對日和約預備會議，應由遠東委員會組織。對日戰爭為遠東及太平洋之戰，遠東十一國對擊敗日本的貢獻，雖因參戰先後有不同，戰役損失有輕重。然為阻止侵略的貢獻則是一致的，並且他們有簽署日本投降條款的先例，故商議和約實在不應摒棄他們。在法理上，遠東委員會產生於一九四五年十二月莫斯科三外長會議，並獲得中國政府的贊同，從一九四六年二月二十六日起，遠東委員會便開始為管制日本和重建遠東和平而努力，自應負起對日和約預備事項。誠然，遠東委員會的組織是美前國務卿貝爾納斯的提案，為當時美蘇意見的協調，莫洛托夫勉强接受了，自然不是蘇聯理想中管制日本的組織。不過在今天，外長會議的組織旣日趨於少數，性質又愈趨於大國專斷，中法的權利和地位都感受嚴峻限制之際，我們為了加强國際合作，為了遠東和平的重建，以十一國共同負責對日和約預備事項，實不失為尊重多數國家權利與地位的方策。</p>
<p>第二，四大國否決權問題。　否決權卽是大國的同意權，不單是外長會議有之，卽遠東委員會會議時中美英蘇四國亦有之，我國政府尊重遠東委員會形式，反對英美祗採用三分之二的多數決的主張，就是為了要維持四强保有否決權的傳統。對德和約，英美蘇法旣保有否決權；則對日和约，中國自應同樣保有否決權。否決權是我們的保障，我國必須維護。對日和約關係我國將來之存亡，實較任何國為大，我們為擁護聯合國憲章，保障國家的利益，我們不避與蘇聯一致之嫌，而堅決主張四强同意權，卽一國否決權。我國建議對日和約由十一國共同籌備，而以保留四强同意權為條件，符合法理，適應情勢。我們希望美蘇互忍互讓，把各不相同的方案，截長補短，尋求妥協，則一切的僵局均可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>打開僵局的途徑，本無多大的困難，祗要蘇聯方面同意由十一國召集，不拘泥四强外長會議的主張，英美方面同意四强同意權，放棄以單純的三分之二多数決的成見，僵局就打開了。解決國際爭端，是靠國與國間的妥協，羅斯福的聯合國理想，是以開誠心佈公道為最高境界。我們讀貝爾納斯的「老實話」，深感强大國家的政治家外交家似乎太缺少解決國際糾紛的妥協性，我們深深地為國際合作的前途擔憂。我們願於此重申我們的主張：中國的建議是含有妥協性和建設性的，希望美蘇兩國再作冷靜考慮以後，尋求打開僵局的途徑！</p>

<h3>美援華呼聲</h3>
<p>（上接一版）　美國國内新聞方面最富有經驗，而具有保守性之記者觉洛克，認為紐約州長杜威及其他國會共和黨諸領袖要求援華一節，係為共和黨政治策劃之混合物，對共產黨勢力在亞洲蔓延之成脅眞正關注。共和黨對中國問題所持之立塲，巳形成在外交政策方而之辯論，而在此方面。共和黨在若干年來，首次能領導民十黨，走向一目　，而不再民随於後也。共和黨在杜魯門主義及馬歇爾計劃方面，難追隨民主黨政府，然共和黨之過會　及援華，而政府則注　西歐一節，則為雙方對此問題之出發點不問處，但美國對華政策，將不致演為兩主要政黨問之直接爭端，政府或不致認為中國之前途無如歐洲對美國係之重要。政府之意見係為第一件事當先為之、　並非謂第二件事則屬次要，　為，第二件事當可安心等待，直至為完成第一件事之基礎得吿奠定之時。</p>
<p>共和黨黨員，而為胡佛密友，並為所謂共和黨老黨員之蘇利文，對杜成之援華演說，異常重視，渠認為杜威廿四日之演說，與眾　外交委員會於廿五日所提之六千萬美元緊急援華建議，為不謀而合者。但後者一舉。或為國會共和黨議員對紐約州長兼為共和黨名義領袖所提建議表示之一致行動。在任何情况下，此實為一非當發展。以全世界為基礎，對共產主義之抵抗，巳成為共和黨之政策，而該黨此項政策，较政府所持之政策更為完全充分，共和黨之新政策，絕非與政府之政策有所反對處。</p>
<p>曾於一九一九年至一九三一年與中國共產黨有密切關係，而且前則反國際共產主義，直率批評之索可夫斯基，要求美國將存於大西洋區域之剩餘戰爭物資，移交予蔣主席，渠稱：蔣主席實際上刻在為抵制外來侵略而作戰。</p>
<p>公認為自由主義人士，而忠實擁護羅斯福新敎之格校夫頓，認為杜威主張援華，係為其本身之政治利益，渠稱：美國政府並未遺忘中國·</p>
<p>名義上為軍事分析評論家，但亦常涉輪及外交問題之伊里奧特，重申其論點謂，美國必須以其有限之資源，着重於西歐之復興，而不應企圖同時援歐援華，而致復耗費其精力</p>
<p>按上述各一方之意見，雖未能代表一切，然第一可反映出美國目前各万人士對歐洲與中國在美國計劃中所佔之相對重要性方面之主要不同意見。第二，由於國會內外共和黨方面之評論，致引起美國人士對中國問題之更高程度之興趣，蓋共和黨方面，曾批評政府之對華政策，　批評其缺乏對華政策。第三，美國總統大選之中，轉瞬來臨之際，某一政黨或雙方為其本身之政治效果計，儘量利用過內外問題，而謀取優勢，　一政黨攻擊其認為敵黨政策或政　中之漏洞。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會閉幕　聖地分治計劃卒獲通過阿族代表集團即出會塲</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約三十日電〕聯合國一九四七年度大會業巳閉幕，雖因美蘇在巴勒斯坦分治一案上合作，而局面梢見起色，然此二大國幾乎在其他重要問題上，處處發生爭執。美蘇之爭將　續在倫敦外長會議中出現。大會主席阿朝哈在主持開幕禮七十四日六小時五十八分鐘後宣佈閉幕，並稱，本屆會議必須推進世界「進入和平，否則即爲爭執」。阿氏昨日已表示舉世注視倫敦會議，並　請與會國導求和平之正道。賴依稱：「人類之進化無分時代及疆域，然戰爭可能被禁止，特別因人類之最後之的在於和平，對德奧日和約之協議，將爲在其他問題上協調之具體步驟」。</p>
<p>〔路透社弗魯辛廿九日電〕聯大全體大會頃以卅三票對十三票，通過巴勒斯坦之分治計劃，中英等十國　權，暹羅缺席。聖地將被分爲阿拉伯及猶太兩獨立國及一國際管理之耶路撒冷市，聯合國機構將選派委員會前往聖地執行分治計劃，預定於一九四八年八月一日完成工作。法國，海地，里比利亞，菲律賓之投贊成票，爲助成三分之二多數之原因。在表決前，黎巴嫩代表賈蒙爲防止分治計劃之通過，會提出一六點聯邦計劃作爲折衷方案，主張建立巴勒斯坦聯邦，內設猶太及阿拉伯兩邦之政府。美蘇代表均認爲該項建議，並非妥協性者，要求立即就分治計劃實行表決。</p>

<p>〔合衆社耶路撒路三十日電〕今日猶太人被殺者已有五人，獵人立即宣稱，聯合國決定巴勒斯坦分治後，阿拉伯人已首先使用暴力。英軍立即隔絕耶路撒冷及合拉維夫間之交通。猶人整夜狂歡慶祝，阿拉伯區則無動靜。然阿人在耶路撒冷及海發中途之那勒斯鎭舉行示威遝動，大批阿人傾聽鼓吹反抗分治之演說。示威者致電大主敎　賽尼稱，「吾人準備流血」以阻止巴勒斯坦裂爲獵阿兩邦。赫氏刻在大馬色，傳擬出席巴勒斯坦高級阿刺伯委員會。獵人慶說之熱烈，爲一九一七年英國常勝將軍北趨解放聖地以來所僅見，猶人狂呼「猶太國萬歲」，且議嘲英室，然無意外發生。</p>

<h3>巴基斯坦參加對德和會　四外長獲致協議　蘇堅持建立德中央政府</h3>
<p>「路透社倫敦廿九日電」四强外長開會四次，討論議程問題，至今日始就兩點成立協議：　同意承認巴基斯坦爲盟國，許其就對德和約之籌備提出意見。　議定俟京德國和約其礎成立協定後，再討論由何國出席和會。此外之討諭仍集中於應先討論德國中央政府，抑先討論擬具和約之問題。</p>
<p>四外長之立塲分述如下：員文提出之計劃，主張先有適當的德國政府，以就和約提出意見並簽訂和約。皮杜爾主張先討論和約，渠認先設政府，對於和約內容具有危險。馬歇爾認爲起草和約乃最急迫之事，但渠又表示，和約與政府不能互相倚賴。莫洛托夫仍堅持必須先有德國政府，始能討論和約。</p>
<p>四外長今日首先討論者，爲上屆莫斯科會議關於和約程序之第七十八號文件，第一爭執之點爲阿爾巴尼亞及巴基斯坦之是否得就和約提出意見，莫洛托夫主張准許兩國提出意見，馬歇爾則表示不能認阿爾巴尼亞曾與德國有戰爭狀態之存在，故不能接受阿爾巴尼亞。莫洛托夫則以阿爾巴尼孤曾對軸心國作戰爲理由，以資答辨。貝文亦反對阿爾巴尼亞，並指出英國尙不能與阿樹立良好關係，故主張改日再討論阿爾巴尼亞問題而先准許巴基斯坦之參加。莫洛托夫表示首肯，該案乃吿解決，四外長旋乃進入討論和會抑德國政府孰先之問題，貝文外相爲使討論得以迅述進行起見，提出下列建議：由一德國政府之代表在和會中陳述意見，和約應由一德國政府簽字，和約並須經德國批准。良文並主張將陳述意見簽字及批准之問題留待討論結束時討論，以免妨碍目前之協議。馬歇爾表示對於貝文之建譏尙需繼續研究，渠並曰，常前第一急迫　務即　　　和約之　訂，復曰美代表　　　在和會召開前，有適當的德國政府之存在，但　膨和會　德國政府問題不可互相　賴，要之，在舉行德國和會時，　許一德國政府之代表或　國之負責代議　會陳述　見。皮　爾　爲德國　央政府之問題，　俟討論　國未來政治地位時再　，渠並認在和平條件確立於德國，以及得以保證　國之必尊重民主　則以前。目前之盟國管制委員會不　　撒</p>

<p>「本報訊」倫敦三十日廣播：巴黎訊，法國民議會昨夜通宵開曾，截止本日中午，會議猶在進行中，會中所討論之主題，係關於如何消　工潮及保議不參加罷工之工人。共產黨議員出言不　，猛烈抨擊許　　閣，　致使會議　　爲之中斷。</p>
<p>「路透社巴黎廿九日電」許曼總理於今晨國民議會之特別會議中，提出取締罷工法案，許曼曾大聲疾呼，若罷工賡續至十二月一日，彼等將爲法國幣制，掘成墳墓。該案給予政府以應付工　局勢之特權，包括加重對破壞者之制裁　確保工作自由，加强對共和國制度之保護，增加全國警力等。共黨與許曼政府之鬥爭，顯然已達最後關頭。</p>
<p>巴黎空氣緊張，有深恐共黨將佔領公共建築物，經由罷工，切斷巴黎與外界之連繫者。同時據可據方面息：過去廿四小時中，被控破壞及阻止工作之罪而被捕者有一百八十人之多，法國中部聖埃的安城，示威者企圖侵入市政府及警察局，警察曾以坦克及摧淚彈應付。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎卅日電〕議會全夜開會討論許曼總理要求特權處置工潮，保護不罷工人員案，共黨議員採取阻撓戰略，致使該案無法表決。會議至今晨十時，已歷二十小時之久，尙未散會。內政部長莫契宣稱，共黨如繼讀搗亂，則政府將以命令行之。巴愁郊外鐵路員工一千五百人亦舉行全夜會議，表決於　適當時期採取行動」，如實行罷工，實爲對於政府一大打學。罷工工人現已達二百萬人。</p>
<h3>政府與總工會談判已吿破裂</h3>
<p>「合衆社巴黎卅日電」法　理許曼昨日採取嚴峻措置，同時國民議會中亦大加指責，顯然出乎總工會中共黨領袖意料之外。彼等與勞工部長梅雅談判取消罷工之條件，直至册日淸晨，談判於四時五十五分終止，並未取得折衷協方。總工會領袖弗則雄稱：「吾人並不滿意，吾人雖全力以赴，然一切要求竟被拒絕。吾人擬將結果轉向各同志。」</p>

<h3>比里對人民廣播·自由暹軍將採行動</h3>
<p>「中央社曼谷廿九日電」還前總理　比里巴諾榮，廿七日夜間自新加坡無綫電台，對暹羅人民播講，囑暹人保持安定，勿逞暴力。渠並爲自由暹國在政治上之地位辯護，渠稱：「余盼吾人恢復暹人自由擇敢之神聖憲法之目標，將於相當時期內，可藉和平途徑達成」。</p>
<p>此問政變團體解釋，　此里之廣播，爲一種宣傳運動，旨在使世界人士，對暹新政府，不加重視。多數觀察家，認爲　比里之廣播，乃爲對　全國自由暹國份子所發之命令。自　比里離國後，暹羅各地，即盛傳自由暹國，已準備攻擊退羅之軍事控制勢力，此尤以暹羅之東北部爲然。據退報本日訊，軍事當局已獲悉自由暹國軍隊，將於明日開好展開大規模行動。</p>

<h3>外長代表會議　討論奧和約　恐不能如期完成報吿</h3>
<p>「路透社倫敦廿九日電」討論奧國問題之四外長代表，今日上午十時半舉行第三次會議，仍尙在解釋階段。今去彼等呈覆外長會議之期之星期二僅有兩日，英美蘇三代表尙未表示是否能接受法國關於奧境德資產之折衷建議。迄至目前爲止，僅由法代表薛利爾釋明在法國之折衷方案下，奧國油業將有幾許財產實際移轉給條聯，以及實際上不能移轉之財產，應由奧給予蘇聯以幾許賠償額。蘇代表柯的諾夫已提出若干補充的事實問題，但並未說明是否接受法國之主張。觀察家對於各代表之能否於週二提出一致報吿，尙表懐後。</p>

<h3>實行戡亂急要措施嚴厲管制金融物資　蔣經國可能擔任新機構負責人　治本辦法已呈主席核批</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾，滬市長吳國楨，中央銀行總裁張嘉　，日前接奉主席命令，爲切實穩定金融，抑平物價，改善民生指示原則，命擬訂有效辦法，澈底執行。宣氏等奉令後，即邀集若干經濟專家詳細硏究，業已分別擬訂治標與治本兩項辦法。據中央社記者獲悉，其治標辦法，爲臨時措施，名稱爲「經濟戡亂急要措施」，經主席授予全權，已於十一月廿八日開始實施，十二月一日起將加緊進行。</p>
<p>淞滬警備司令部，市政府，中央銀行共同執行此項「經濟戡亂急要措施」之三機關，採取分工合作方式，日內將成立總執行機構，其負責人將由中央派大員担任之，蔣經國氏爲可能人選。據悉：蔣氏巳　命定一二日內來滬。</p>
<p>「急要措施」之第一步驟，爲抽緊銀根，國家銀行停止放款，不准透支，並推及其他行莊之往夾戶，一律不得透支，法幣之流動性使之儘量萎縮，外埠對滬匯款將予拒收，尤以北方及香港爲主要。預料彼時本市銀根之緊，將造成空前局面，物價將繼續下跌。興風作浪之投機份子，必將自食其果，以投機爲業之行莊，勢將倒閉若干中央銀行過去對彼等曾盡力維持，現則「決不顧惜」。</p>
<p>第二步驟爲關於物資之管制，已擬定「釜底抽薪」辦法，即所有民生必需之各項重要物資，將予嚴格管制，大部份由政府掌握，不再任其成爲不法商人囤積牟利之商品。目前不法商人所囤積之物資，將由警備部發動軍警將全市倉庫予以普遍淸查，查出有囤積嫌疑之物資，即予封存，然後由政府以平價配售予全市市民，而有囤積嫌疑之商人，將依違反總動員法，予以軍法處辦。</p>
<p>此二項步驟所訂各項辦法，由巾央銀行總裁張嘉璈於日前携京，向行政院長張羣請示，張總裁定一日返滬，預料可於最近期內實行。</p>
<p>關於治本辦法，宣鐵吾，吳國楨，張嘉璬三氏會同擬訂後，已送京呈主席核批，其內容聞大致爲實行日用品配給制度，以澈底解決民生問題。</p>
<h3>鋼精紙糜費外匯錫紙業呼籲限制</h3>
<p>「本報訊」本市錫紙業工業同業公會，爲捲烟所用之外貨鋼精紙充斥市場，影響該業生存，特於昨晚招待各報記者作緊急呼續，要求各華商烟廠本愛國節約之旨，儘量採用國產錫紙，俾維持民族工業。據該會理事長高文亮稱：捲烟錫紙本由國產錫紙廠商供給，自外貨鋼精紙入口後，遂取而代之。勝利後政府深知鋼精紙爲奢侈品，故不予結匯進口，但私貨仍源源來滬，而在滬之瑞商華鋁鋼精廠原以製造我人所需之鋼精用具爲大宗，最近亦大量改製鋼精紙，致使國產之錫紙工業瀕於危境。査錫紙除光澤不及鋼精紙外，其餘防潮防霉之效用實勝於鋼綪紙，價格方面亦較黑市之鋼精紙爲廉，徒以捲烟廠商競尙虛華，寗捨價廉之錫紙而不用，反採用鋼精紙。依照本年八個月份之統計，所耗代價已近八千億。姑以美金行市五萬元計，則折合美金已達一千六百萬元之鉅。此數可購飛機一千六百架，或汽車一萬六千輛，或商船四萬噸。倘吾人不用鋼精紙，一年之後，國防建設均可完成，立爲强國。本業方面現要求：　捲烟廠商憬然覺悟，採用國貨，不特可以維護錫紙工業，顧全數萬工人生計，尤可節省大量外匯，充實國防建設。　請政府限制華鋁鋼精廠之大量生產，共銷數不得超過市塲需要量百分之二十。　請求政府配給靑鋁滇錫等原料，俾直接减輕生產成本，間接减輕消費者之負擔。</p>

<p>「封神榜」與「西遊記」雖然已經禁印，但是改編後的「美太公」與「玄奘出國」，依舊是連環圖畫中最暢銷書之一，每版三千本，前幾月已經三版出書。至於最近最風行的人物是「泰山」，無論「泰山」出險，救子，勦匪，祗要畫面上有那麽一幅力大無比，履險如夷的偶像出現，孩子們便爭先拜讀，紙貴洛陽。口吐白光，千里外取人首級的時代是過去了，但是代之而起的依然是一種超人的描繪。據一個中等家庭的家長說：「小毛頭」放學回來，怒眉橫目，兩臂高舉，哇啦啦到處找尋被征服的對象的，那定是在學校門口書攤上看了什麽「泰山平番」之類；有時候「小毛頭」掩身門後，以手指扮成手槍模樣，等待人到，突然出現的，那定是讀了「俠盜魯平」「福爾摩斯」之後的溫習。據他事後對孩子的詳細調査，證明絲毫無誤。</p>
<p>力圖上游反遭虧蝕</p>
<p>爲什麼出版者還繼續編印這些近乎無聊的連環圖畫呢？據幾個不顧銷路力爭上洗的出版書商說：像惜陰書局編印過「文天祥」「國父的幼年」「一代偉人羅斯福」「民族烈士閻應元」，美華書局編印過「馬占山」「祥林　」「南京大屠殺」，文華書局編印過「抗戰八年」「萬世師表」等等，都曾企圖以高超而新穎的思想衝破神怪的樊籬，但結果失敗了，銷路慘淡，虧蝕不堪。爲的是小明友不大喜歡這一套！</p>
<p>神怪腳本易於通過</p>
<p>還有社會局審査內容的時候，神怪離奇的脚本，倒是比較傳記歷史之類容易通過，這對於出版商的心理影響很大。傳記因爲而要考據，審査時間不免較長，據說美華畫局去年想出版一本「廖軍長」，記述廖　湘的抗戰經歷，編寫之初，旁微博引，考證綦詳，但直到最近方纔通過，送審迄今　延一年，這當中聽說有許多細節斟酌修改，費時最多。臂如原稿上軍人行禮用左手，審査後令改右手；廖耀湘逃難時晝稿上爲他少盡了一頂軍帽，並且身着破爛衣服，作者的意思是指明他倉卒突圍，艱苦卓絕的景况，但審査時社局認爲身爲軍人，臨難不苟，衣冠尤應整齊，如此畫面，簡直跡近侮衊，於是着令重起爐灶，盡行改繪。化費了較創作神怪圖畫數倍的時間。</p>
<p>十分之四遠銷海外</p>
<p>上海現在有八十家書局專門出版連環圖畫，由去年初直到今年八月底，包括歷史，科學，倫理，言情，武俠，滑稽，偵探等各類，總共已出版了一千二百餘種。現在依舊保持着日出兩部的產量，假使在夏天，孩子們執卷納凉，銷路轉好，產量可以增至每日四部。這些畫籍有十分之一銷南洋，十分之三銷台灣，據說僑胞們强迫孩子閱讀，讓他們從生動而詳盡的盡面上咀嚼祖國的實情。</p>
<p>在紛呶喧囂的市應中，你曾否留意過那些侷處在弄口街頭的速環圖　攤旁，小朋友們正以節省下來的點心費，在覓取着自己豪華的想像？</p>
<p>每天擁有任何圖畫館十倍以上的讀者　高超新穎的思想却衝不破神怪的樊籠</p>
<h3>高檢處首檢　論赦免犯罪</h3>
<p>與其釋放後仍回籠不如使移邊疆墾荒</p>
<p>「本報專訪」記者日前赴高檢處趨訪首席檢察官杜保祺氏，以下列三事叩詢：　本市元旦頒佈之大赦令，漢奸犯未蒙恩澤，近來聞首都有人建議，請求政府於明年元旦補下一令，使漢奸犯亦有獲赦之機會，並聞將來　政實施時，有再度大赦傳說，以示與民更始之意，首席對此事有所聞否？　　華影人員張善琨等附逆案，在高檢處偵査已久不知結果如何？又岳楓，李麗華等均在被偵査之列，但已有新作影片「三女性」問世，首席對此之意見若何？　僞聯保長百餘人被控通敵案，牽涉本市聞人名流甚多，高檢處對此將加何辨法？杜氏對第一問題，避免作正面答覆，稱關於大赦茲事體大，須待將來大總統選出後決定，未能縣揣。惟對於本年元旦之大赦，實有可商討之處，蓋政府頒佈赦典之目的，在使犯罪之人有自新之機會，化無用爲有用，以參加社會生產，若以此評價本年元旦之大赦，顯未能達此目的。被赦免者犬多數係竊盜犯，若輩於出獄後，徬徨街頭，衣食住均成問題，社會方面亦無人加以援助，若輩惟有仍找「老頭子」，重過「竊盜」生涯，以解決衣食問題。故釋放不久，幾全部回籠。憶昔南市法院，上午釋出之幼年竊盜犯十二名，至下午仍因竊盜案解至法院，故不從根本上解決，實難收澄淸社會之效果。渠意根本辦法，惟有將無家可歸之犯人「實邊」，移殖於人烟稀少之地區，如西北之靑海，寗夏，新疆，及海中之荒島，使其屯墾，一方面可使不良份子與整個社會隔離，一方面充實邊區力量，從專墾荒生產，化無用爲有用。歐美各國，常將犯人用船運至茺島墾殖，亦即比意。渠稱曾將此意見貢獻於司法當局，大槪因國事擾攘，財政困細，未蒙採納，渠希興論界予以鼓吹，俾能見諸實行。</p>
<h3>李麗華等拍片尙無違法之處</h3>
<p>杜氏對第二問題，稱關於電影人員附逆案，迄今未能結案，高檢處亦至爲焦灼，曾屢次向有關機關去函調査，朱獲答覆，致偵査不能順利進行。又僞華影張善琨等數十人係一整個案子，必須同時解決，因有數人偵査未畢，致全案亦隨之擱淺。此爲該案遷延之原因。至岳楓李麗華等在偵査期間，不能確定有通敵罪嫌，其攝製影片，尙無違法之處。杜氏對第三問題，稱僞聯保長百餘人亦係整個案子。必須同時解決，偵査爲聯保長注重若輩在淪陷期間有無對於敵人勾結，對於人民不利之行爲，如罪跡昭著，當予起訴。</p>
<h3>官商勾結舞弊案當局正加緊偵訊　最早密吿人爲陸根記營造廠怡豐行經手輸入達千餘億元</h3>
<p>「本報訊」官商勾結舞弊鉅案中有關各犯，截止昨日，大部已遭警備部扣押，其中除江海關輸入許可證騐估課帮辦尹蘭蓀，岳新民，張褻匯，及曾任職海關關員之張遠四人外，進出口商行亦有四家負責人及重要職負十餘名。彼等一部份　押於南市前曾拘禁漢奸之看守所內，一部份則尙在第三稽査大隊內，並均禁止接見家屬，昨雖爲星期日，奉命來滬　査之國防部李處長希成仍督同上述各有關機關人員繼續加緊秘密審訊。據記者獲悉：此案最早密吿人爲陸根記營造廠，惟所控各點並不如目前經澈査後所發現者之「傽大」，尤以進出口商行中，與此案有關者復大有人在，即以九江路花旗銀行大樓中四一三號怡豐行而論，經手舞弊及偸天換日進口之輸入物資爲數已達千餘億，故該行經理毛豐翔於廿四日晚被捕後，次日行中重要職員多名亦同遭拘押。由毛之供述，復牽涉進出口報關行三家，此三家尙在偵査期內，故未便透露商號名稱及被捕人之姓名，至於有軍人身份者牽涉在內一點，有關人員昨未加肯定，或可能爲某部之庫要職員。</p>

<h3>普選在香港　搬演「飛象渡河」等怪劇</h3>
<p>〔木報香港廿六日航訊〕廿一日全國第一次普選的消息，在被列爲選舉困難區的香港，却給英公主伊麗莎白的婚訊遮掩了！港中對國內普選的舉行的與論，都祇就國內情勢作一般的檢討，對於香港百萬僑胞臨時喪失了珍貴的選舉權，大家噤若寒蟬，似有鄭言之隱。在港府正式表示態度禁止僑胞在港內舉行選舉之前，木港華商總會內設的香港區選舉軍務所，曾引起廣大的注意。常日，港中商界巨子對國大代表惑到興趣者，大不乏人。月前的華商總會的理事長選舉，爲了這個關係曾展開有史以來的激烈競爭。港中婦女界領袖兩人，曾公開表示參加國大競選，而且亙相攻評。一個指對方「飛象渡河」，因爲她來自廣州，一個指對方曾受偽府保護，因爲她主辦的一個女子中學校的校董有些是投偽人物。而若干僕僕省港間的人物，他們艱辛締造的「好戲」，也不能及時演出，他們這幾天來看看報上所載其他地方競選揭曉的消息，心頭是多麼難過呵！（特約記者子健）</p>

<h3>當局擬實施全面管制　定花紗布價格　將先從各地棉花統購統配入手</h3>
<p>﹝木報訊﹞紡織會主管當局易人後，開有決心將日前躑躅未決之權棉紗聯合配銷試行辦法。改爲花紗布全面管制之局。大致擬在保證各廠商再生產成木之條件下，望花紗布關係各廠商，能共體政府穩定物價主旨，犧牲小我利益，使花紗布共臻於平穩之局面。</p>
<p>聞該一全面管制政策，將先從統購棉花，統配原棉，至統購統銷紗布爲止。並將在全國花紗布重心，如上海，天津，靑島，漢口，等地，同時實行，以求貫澈，而劃一政令。一般觀察，最近物價迭吿波動，花紗布實佔舉足輕重之地位。花紗布價格如能有全面性之穩定，於整個物價穩定政策，助益尤多。</p>
<p>惟據關係方面推測，此間民營紗廠對聯配試行辦法之施行，意見已多，一旦實施在紗布全面管制，恐更惑有難於運行之苦衷。然爲整個物價政策設想，此項全面管制政策，實有澈底執行之必要云。</p>

<h3>當局抑平物價　將繼續抽緊銀根　發行五萬元大鈔說絕對無稽</h3>
<p>據本市有關當局負責人宣稱：最近中央銀行爲抑平物價，厲行抽緊銀，已獲致相常成效、乃有若干投機商人，故意散播詢言，謂此次國行抽緊銀根。係五萬元大鈔即將發行之先聲，以冀　亂人心，實則當同採取此項措施，係本抑平物價之絕大決心，事實將證明上述謠言絕對無稽，彼投機商人如仍興風作浪，不自　跡，必將自食其果云。</p>

<h3>談「哀感頑艷</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>筱丹桂自殺案公審的時候，旁聽的人居然滿坑滿谷，「法院廣塲爲之塞滿」（見十一月二十八日申報），芸至還有人爲了一看張春帆，竟在法庭森嚴之地，「破門而入」，致遭逮捕。從浮面看來，這不過是上海人愛熱閙新奇的一種表現；但是，這深處遠處看，却實在令人有些不寒而慄了。</p>
<p>筱丹桂自殺前後的心情是不難想像的。她讀書不多，安分守已，即使受了種種難堪的折磨，至多也祇是哭一塲，一死了之，而並沒有找律師，求法律上的救濟。但是，一個相當走紅的名伶，何以竟就死得這標容易呢？依我看，她所主演的那些戲的情節倒是一個主要原因。</p>
<p>試翻越劇廣吿。幾乎每一部戲都是悲劇，而且廣告上用得最多的宣傳語句都是「哀感頑艷」，「總綿誹惻」這一套，前一陣還有用那句名句「苦是苦得來一的。彷彿一部戲祇要引得觀衆淚如泉湧，便是空前成功。筱丹桂主演冷山導演的「怒火之花」就是一個例子。這部戲我是沒有看過的，但是就根據張春帆寥寥數語的供詞，就可見一斑了。他說，這本戲的內容是「講一個姨太太被人引誘，結果自殺的事」。筱丹桂一方面固然有和這戲的女主角不免會有一些同病相憐之感，而這本戲裏女主角的出路却無論如何一定發生了灌移默化的作用。這本　的情節是有毒素的，而眞正敎唆了筱丹桂自殺的，就正是還本戲的毒素！</p>
<p>筱丹桂之死，不幸更加强了這毒素的力量。許多戲院已經天天在上演以她之自殺爲題材的戲劇　當然，廣吿上又少不了「哀感頑艷」之類的字句，這毒素就在天天更擴大起來，更深入了許多讀書未必甚多的家庭主婦和女備之流的心裏。「晴示」的力量旣如此之深，而在此世亂年荒的時代，「刺激」本來也不在少累積的「暗示」加上「刺激」，就可能有不堪設想的結果了。</p>
<p>戲劇是最直接的宣傳，一國國運之盛轟也以反映於戲劇者爲最明顯。八年抗戰之後，今日所需要的是壯大的氣魄和開拓的精神；「哀感頑艷」之類的東西，我們實在沒有再加容忍的理由了！</p>
<h3>紙話</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>甚麽是紙張？</p>
<p>當然，我，我隨便可以回答說：這就是本文用以印刷的東西，就是你昨天寫信用的東西，也就是每天早晨報販送到你府上來的東西。</p>
<p>可是，不久前有人會到華盛頓的阿鉢爾頓去看過一所奇怪的房屋，經過三載寒署之後，那屋子不顧雨打日　，依舊兀立無恙。然而那屋子望完全是用紙造的——屋頂，牆壁，地板，一切都是紙。</p>
<p>美國一個中西部的一個糧食商，亦有過他的特殊經騐。有一次暴風雨把他倉庫的屋頂打毀了，裏面藏着幾百包紙袋盛的糧食，一塲陣爾把那些沒有遮蓋的東西全沒濕了。可是糧食壊了沒有？一些也沒有，沒有一些水潰。</p>
<p>最近又聽說有一種紙製的窗帘已在出售了。爲一家人家的主人正坐着看他的夜報，電話鈴聲響了。他就把他的香烟放在烟灰缸中去接電話。一陣風把紙製的窗帘　在烟灰缸上。但窗帘上僅燙了一個焦痕，沒有發生別的家庭災禍。</p>
<p>紙張在它的歷史過和中曾經塲早報不止一次的革命。第一，它使得文字的流佈可能；第二，它供給了一種包紥的物資，要是沒有這，現代的大百貨公司就無法成立。今天它又在創造第三次革命了，其結果將使過去我們對於紙張的觀念完全一變。</p>
<p>紙科學家宣佈說，我們穿紙衣服，用紙碗盆取食，在紙地毯上走路，在紙被單上睡覺，以及在紙屋子裏生活的日子是不遠了</p>
<p>這些新的紙製產品，若干業已出現於市塲，將大大减輕你的經濟負担，因爲紙的製造過程是一切製造過程中最簡單的，所以成本亦廉。</p>
<p>然而你怎能把紙變成你　心所欲的東西呢？這正就是紙學家們造成紙張革命的訣　所在。你祗消懂得某種化學物品，你的紙張立即變成不是普通的紙張了。</p>
<p>有一種耐濕力的紙張，現在已有多種用途，例如楷汽車窗，以及戰時美國海軍用以揩拭光學儀器的紙張，都是這種東西。還有一種超力的紙毛巾，　力勝過普通毛巾。更稀奇的是一種不沾油，能用肥皂和水洗的紙張。</p>
<p>小孩用的圍涎，也有紙製的了，這東西旣吸水，又價廉，用過一次就可以棄掉。主婦用的紙製禦身，柔軟，經洗，且不引火。</p>
<p>防火的紙張也是現代工業的一大奇蹟。戰時美軍所用的砲衣，很多採用這種防火紙。</p>
<p>但是最値得注意的是紙布，這東西可能使衣着發生革命。不久將來將有一種紙布襯衫出現，因其價廉，你穿過一次後不妨丢掉。紙雨衣不久將取玻璃雨衣而代之，紙套鞋亦將媲美橡皮套鞋。</p>
<p>你討厭蒼蠅嗎？經過DDT處　的壁紙可以爲你解決建個問題。</p>
<p>紙對於人類文明已盡了數千年的　獻　但現在它又在開始一個新的革命，並將成爲　合物，織維品，和輕金　世界的一大勁敵。</p>

<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>譚墓石器與肅順</p>
<p>民十九，譯組　院長夢，府令付國葬。當時爲其設計陵堂建築者，以　地近依國父聖寢，計不復能於高張戰立處見長，則務欲於平衍婉移之中別植一格，此　墓之所以特富於園林氣也。</p>
<p>此墓之設計，　靜有餘，高穆未足，相國襟懐，若相喻焉。惟墓前石器，自華表以至於跪柱仰孟之類，幾無一非精品。初見時頗詫是何傑匠，乃有此心眼。久後始知是自昌平肅順墓前移來。或謂是二千金購自肅順後人，或謂是北平古物保管委員會所贈猷，根本未付一錢。事隔多年，不能　定何說爲是；顧以肅順遺物飾譚墓，茶陵地下有知，當不無惑喟。</p>
<p>歴史人物之翻案，若就滿淸未季之一段時期言之，則肅順第一應獲得重新之評價。吾以爲此人有頭腦，有肩膀，其病在驕，於當朝同列，估計太低；遂爲羣醫所乘，而不能免於政治上之圍剿。使當時之東西兩后，不發棄咸盟之遺詔，而以朝事委之，雖穢來之心術變化不可知，顧在政治上必又是一番局面，至少亦必能裁抑西后勢力之興起，客觀上司於滿淸大局有利也。</p>
<p>王湘椅，爲衆所週知曾受恩於肅順之一人，其同治十年七月日記寫二龍坑肅順故宅凋零狀，意頗悲愴。移書肅順之次子來談，竟以無衣冠不能至謝，湘漪至發爲感槪，謂「旗人仍習氣講排塲……與談亦無策可振之。」肅順被戮僅十年，其後　已貧薄至此，則民國二十年後，欲於二千金而出售其先人墓器，殆非不可能之事。</p>
<p>翁常熟日記，記肅順事亦多，稱爲「肅公」，其記咸豐十三年殿試事，有「肅公頤指氣使，視士人若奴隸」語。此子才氣橫厲，而學養未至，縱轡疾馳，固未度同列者之盡側目也，而殺機已隱伏於是矣。</p>
<h3>女奴十年</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>看看報，我才知道最近吞服來沙爾藥水實行自殺的筱丹桂，是一個「的篤班」的「紅伶」。現在，又看看各報關於初審張春帆的紀載，才恍然大悟：所謂「紅伶」原來是一個女奴。爲什麽稱她是女怒？這只要看張春帆的口　便可以明白。他說，「（我）和筱是同鄉關係，認識已有十年，在　縣買下來的。」</p>
<p>筱丹桂的悲劇，不自今日始，可以說是「由來已久」了，因爲筱丹桂是道道地地的「死魂靈」，而和她「認識已有十年」的張春帆，也的的確確做了乞乞可夫的十年好夢夢如今，由於筱的自殺，張春帆也就一覺醒來了。醒來時，自己正在法庭上受法律的控訴，受良心的責備，受情養的苦厄，正是「活該」！</p>
<p>一個證人的話，很有意思，他說筱丹桂的自殺，是「情變」。據他推測，筱丹桂想對冷山好，但是又不敢，只有自殺一條路。在嚴峻粗厲的乞乞可夫的高壓下，筱丹桂能否對他發生愛情，這顯然是一個疑問。甚至於她是否懂得愛情，是否體會到愛情，我看也很成問題。可巧這當兒，正插人了一個第三者者——有婦之夫的冷山，自然是「來得正好」，他給了她知識的食糧，給了她藝術的修養，給了她生活的趣味，他和她，看劇·散步·談心·通信的種種社交生活，漸漸地成爲平常的事，張春帆憤憤然，說：「這，你認為平凡，我却認爲不平凡！」筱丹桂呢，在封建遺毒的影響下徘徊，在新舊思想和情感中掙扎，似乎尋不到知識，尋不到藝術，尋不到愛情，尋不到人生，尋不到出路，只茫然地實感到「做人難」，「難做人」，於是乎「死了」。</p>
<p>像筱丹桂這樣出身的女奴，在夢中做十年或一業子的，並不是沒有；在覺醒後向前走了一步而不願俯首退回一步或昂首再進一步的，實在也很罕見，這是可以惋惜的。</p>
<h3>謫仙怨</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>日前觀「謫仙怨」電影，其中有一位女角（飾勞倫斯的）形容音樂家魯易士有一句話，說他「有點離開了地球」（A　little　off　the　carth），似乎在　端里這一類的。有人對於所謂「詩」下過如下的定義：詩是水棲動物的日記，這種水樓動物離開了水活在陸地上，而又想凌空飛翔。這說的是詩人。</p>
<p>然而身體畢竟離開不了地球，所以莫泊桑說：「我們只須略事思索，便可知道這個世界對於像我們這樣的動物是很不適宜的。思想使我們那些有知識的生物永遠成為地球上可憐的被方逐者」。（或流亡者，此語似含天神被謫下凡之意）。</p>
<p>今日人類雖自稱有數千百年的歷史，然在整個宇宙的發展史，今日的所謂人類也就自然還逗留在「人」「獸」之間的一種動物；「人面獸心」「衣冠禽獸」諒必即是這種動物的形容詞。放然是從人的立場說的，要不然的話，人面是否定比　面雅觀，衣冠是否定比皮毛方便，是頗足成爲爭論的對象的。）可是由於某種「越級演化」，在人類之中間或會發現少數某種介於「神」「人」之間的那人類型動物；他們徜徉於蒼天與俗世之間——雖然生在地球上，可是並不屬於地球。在歷史上我們有時可以見到這一類型的人，此輩實在出世得太平，太早了數千百年，要想在這個世界上獲得成功恐怕不甚容易。孔子，耶穌便是屬於道一羣的；此外還有蘇格拉底，迦理利，哥白尼，馬丁路得……。試看此輩所遭受的命運是如何？他們是離開了水的魚，在人世間很不調協；如果還想離地飛翔，那就難免要被目爲謬種怪物，遭受社會賢達的射擊了。今人常說「世風不古」，對於某類所謂「古道可風」的人難免腹誹他「落伍」，意思是說那種「古道」的時代已經過去了。在這個對自己影子也得鬥爭一翻的時代，這種人的不合時宜是眞的，不過說那種古道時代已經去，那恐未必盡然，人心我豬未必古過，我們想像中的「古道時代」恐怕至今尙未蒞臨。雨果說：今日之世，天國還沒有被搬到地球上來。</p>
<p>大凡人世愈深，便離天國愈遠。小孩子知識未開，是一種介於「神」「人」之間的天使，雖天國還不外，尙在　忽於「天」與「地」之間。聖經中有一句話：「到天國的路是直的，可是隘窄。」我看只有種氣未脫的孩子才有希望由此抵達那邊。偉人的身材顯得太　　了。不宰小孩子總有一天要變爲成人的。由此推想，天國里的人口一定是稀少的吧。</p>

<p>第一章　喜得知音　（一）</p>
<p>梨園界中人，最寶貴是一條嗓子，嗓子好再能用功，無往不利，嗓子不好，行話呌做「沒木錢」。沒本錢，　能花樣翻新，在藝術上，終是遜色，所以一般講究唱戲的，全副精神都注在嗓子上。北平是京朝派名伶發祥地，無論你是老伶工也好，初拜師學徒也好，要想嗓音嘹亮，便須日日吊嗓。在北平住家的，每常天色黎明，偶登高樓，傾耳細聽，　　中會發出尖銳而悠長的喊聲，在不知道的，以爲是收豕奴的呼嘯，內行的便會　出這是吊嗓的喊聲。這些早上吊嗓的人，所選擇的地點，多半都在空　所在，像北平天安門中山公　和太　，地點適中，空氣清爽，都是吊嗓的所在，在水邊牆角，山坡樹下·吊一會嗓子，零零落落，唱了幾句，不但嗓音會日有進步，就是在這淸晨空氣裘，哼哼唱唱，與身體上也大有裨益。所以在太廟和中山公園各處的游人，早上不時會聽到幾句很入耳婉轉歌聲，一般老北平，是司空見慣，對這些吊嗓，和零落的　聲，不惑什麽興趣，遇到由南方新來的游客，一聽這嗓聲，就不免驚奇，羣聲覓影，要看一看選喊嗓唱戲的是什麼人了。</p>
<p>這天已是霜降經後，北平的氣候，和南方不同，只要秋信一來，便是西風卷，黃葉　飛，中山公園雖然是滿園秋意，可是在水榭西邊士山上，翠柏業中，有一個二十多歲靑年，穿著一身挺直西服，來回窄窄山徑上，專心　彷梅腔的　堂　，一段還沒唱完，只　山徑裏沙沙的　聲，一個十二三歲的女孩子，後面跟著一個甜俏小大姐，由樹樹中掩了出來，對靑年不住注視那女孩子灼灼眼光　了靑年幾眼，又湊在小大姐耳旁，似在　　什麽那靑年覺得有人在此打攪，打斷他的雅興，不再吊嗓子，由山徑裹慢慢走下山來。邁過小亭，在山石穢面，隱約有一個女子，藏在那兒　　，一時也不理會，匆匆走到後河月亮門，在一片柿林下　　一會，面對色的　角，調調嗓子，把未完的一段玉堂春，又重新唱了一段。剛把段唱完，背後突發出拍掌的　　，心想又是　在此　亂。回轉身來。縐着眉頭一看，原來是他姑丈魯　栢忙　躬走出去。肖栢笑道：「　　，你近來唱得益發進步了！」渚　忙笑道：「我是胡亂唱的，姑丈你看有什麽不好，　　　指導。」肖栢還沒有答應，由對面樹林內又走出一個少女，向肖栢喊：「　老板！你今大怎麽平就出來。」肖栢道：「我近來患失眠癥，胃口又不好，醫生勸我出來走動走動，我昨天由園子裏回家，到現在還沒睡呢！」</p>

<h3>調頻</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>在無錢電發達猛進的今日，吾人對於接收機的失眞和天電的干擾，都惑覺到極大的苦悶。平常我們在收音時，往往聽到和原來的樂音不相像的聲音，或者發出嘈雜的呌聲，使人聽了刺耳，心裹一陣不舒服。吾人知道這一點毛病的發生，並不在接收機或廣播機中，而是現在通行的調輻（Amplitude　Modulationg）制的一個大缺點，亦爲現在廣播事業的障礙，因爲人們要想補救上面的缺憾，於是就有調頻（Frequency　Modulation）制的發明。</p>
<p>在調輻制的發射機中，是由一個振湯器產生高頻電流與一個低頻訊號，這種低頻訊號，是由聲音的强弱而起變化的，我們利用此種低頻電流去使調輻級（Moduiator）眞空管內屏極電壓起變化，於是使這眞空管輸出電流的振幅隨之而改變，再經過於大工作後，就在天錢上輸送出去，但是在這些工作中，毛病就發生了，這就是當調幅電波在空巾遇到天電時。因爲天電的波幅與調幅波積相似，故二波混合，同時進入接收機，而接收機中的檢彼級又無法將它完全去掉，讓它很自由的經放大管而入揚聲器，於是就發的軋軋的刺耳聲。</p>
<p>調頻制中就沒有這種現象發生，因爲調頻制是將聲音的强弱不同，來使發射於空中之電波的週率，在一定限度之內，隨着而改變。其改變的闊度，就是劉輻制中的旁帶（Sidebands）。如由一種載波（Carrier　Wawe）經聲昔的調幅後，就成三個部分，其中一部分就是原週率，一部分是較原週率高的，還有一部分是較原週率低的，至於其數値則視調幅之週率而定。調頻的週率就是完全用三部分的，但其波輻則使之保持恒定。普通調頻振盪綫路都採用哈德萊（Hartley）式，就是使話筒中的低頻電波來改變電抗管柵積的電壓，再在此管屏極輸出，而入振盪管的柵積，使振盪管內的頻率，問接地受話筒中低頻電波而起變化。如此再經倍周放大，就可將這種等幅波從天錢上輸出。調頻式接收機方面，則比尋常接收機多加一級限制級（Limiter），及週率檢波級，也稱辨頻級（Discriminator）。因爲接收的波幅或有參差，而其先群過限制級波幅，就很平穩，然後再經週率檢波級或放大回音，在上面這些工作中，天電雖然進入天錢，但是無法通過限制級，因爲高低極大之波幅，當不能通過，假使能通過的話，也是微乎其微。如此，接收機的場聲器中就不會有刺耳嘈雜的聲音發生了。</p>
<p>調頻制的優點不但能進免天電的干擾，而且更有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，在功率與射程方面，我們都希望能使發射機的電力，儘可能的减少，則可節省而射程可以加倍。調頻制就是能適合我們的理想。譬如一只調頻式的發射機，可以比同功率的調幅制發射機的射程要遠上幾百倍。</p>
<p>第二，二個或二個以上的調頻電台，可以採用同一週率，同時播音，假使它們相隔的距離適常時，而對於接收機方面，是不受到影響的。但是調幅的電合則不然，往往接收機將收到二個電台的訊號，混亂得分不淸。惟調頻制所須的週率寬度很大，故適用在高頻帶，如八十八到一百零八兆週的一段波帶中，可以設四千多個調頻電台。</p>
<p>第三，調輻制是由電波振輻的大小而變更其所要的範圍，而此種電波不能適合原來樂音的各成份，面將它們完美的傳達出去。所以有失眞的現象發生。調頻制的電波是由頻率的寬度而改變的，低頻的樂音中，無論音調或音色都能籍這種頻率的變動的傳出，不使其失去一些這種優美的樂普。在我們聽起來，就覺到好像直接聽到的一般無二。</p>
<p>第四，調輻制中因振幅的變異，致使各眞空管隨電力大小而變其特性。調頻制中則因波幅恒定之故，能使眞空管盡量發揮其工作效能，以至盡善盡美的地步。調頻制是早在十年前就被美國亞姆司脫朗（Armstrong）敎授所發明，起制在他主張把調幅制改為調頻制之時，當然的不受人家所重視，後來經他不斷的努力，終於成功，那年是一九三五年，他的第一架調頻發射機造成了，電力二百萬瓦，當時他用了七十幾個眞空管，週率是用的四十四兆週，而今日的調頻發射機所用的質空管數逐漸减至二十個，電力不過五萬瓦而已，不久的將來，常可將目前的調幅制取而代之了。</p>
<h3>氟</h3>
<p>— 洪恩</p>
<p>元素中的「壞人」</p>
<p>鹵是一個頑固的家族，照化學家言，它們是有力的而不可預言的。像著名的「黨員」氯與溴，祗不過在短時間前馴服了，而今惡狠的氣也變成一個有用的元素</p>
<p>幾世紀前的化學家，就想如何能使氯工作，但是這元素是極可怕的一遇到氫就變成氟氫酸—科學上一個最有毀壊力的反應。</p>
<p>現在經過幾年的艱苦實騐，科學已將這壤蛋，變成一個有用的公民，在殺虫劑，可塑體（Plastics）冷却液（Refrigeratingliquid）中是一個主要成份。氟更可用來做燦爛的染料，保護油（使他物不致氧化），在高電壓中使一氣體差不多成爲完全的絕緣體一優良殺菌劑，改良過的燻烟消毒，有溶解力，不怕火的物質以及松香。氟：這過云的幾年中從魔鬼轉變到天使，這無色比空氣重而有刺激的氣體，在諸元素中，豐富地排列在第二十位上。</p>
<p>從一六七〇到一八八六年最光明的化學腦子，都在希望使純粹的氟孤立的競爭中，直等到一個不著名的法國化學家亨利馬山（Henri　Moissan），在一八八六年用電解的方法使氟孤獨存在了，才解決了這個難題。</p>
<p>現在又經過許多謬誤的試臉驗，終於能用一個實用方法，將單獨的氟大量出產，用一隻特別設計的電解電池，裏面包藏氟化鉀和氟化氧，溫度維持在一百度攝氏左右，當電解作用正在進行氫氯兩氣產生，設計的特別就是使氟氫不能化合，如果化合必有大爆炸，而使氟方的器械可能毀滅</p>
<p>硏究人員企圖將電解成的氟，裝納在一個適合的容器裏而出賣，可是鋼銅在普通壓力下，橋到氟要腐蝕，不能配製容器，只有在詳細硏究下，證明一種塡布物（Gasket橡皮等所製造）可以旣不和氟起作用，又包裝後不會走漏一點氟，當出賣時祇不過是少數的氟，裝在圖筒裏—大約一磅半的氟在四百磅的壓力下。</p>
<p>這純粹的氟有奇怪的性質，它的原子是積會交際的，奔跑找尋化學朋友，因爲它們的怱忙，常常毀壞其他穩定的物質。像氟和矽起作用會變成一種氣體，氟又極容易吸收氫比氣為甚。</p>
<p>當一筒氟氣放着，無論玻璃，石綿，岩石碰到它總變一陣烟，他們都是矽的混合物，所以積容易和氟起作用，如果將氟噴射在水面上氟會把氣趕去而和氫化合，因而發出强烈濃烟；同樣方法熟的鋼和木條也會發出烟來。</p>
<p>因爲氯有以上狡猾的脾性，所只限於實臉室的需要，和技術人的應用。</p>
<p>旣然純粹的氟是最新出品，大量的氟化物也叫它們變成工作。螢石（Flour　spar）是主要的氟礦它是一種美麗的晶礦，常常靈敏地顯出一種文雅的顏色，看起來却不知裏面隱藏了惡廣氟。產螢石在美國最多處Illinois，Now　Monico,　Kontrclky等如果將六到八磅的螢石加入一噸鋼之內，在開爐法（Open　hearth　process）之下積容易使鋼溶解，旣省燃料，而做出的鋼又是高超一等。</p>
<p>在製造琺瑯（Enamels）的時候每年也須要大量的螢石，因爲螢石能降低在琺瑯中原素的融解點更使完成的物質增加光彩。玻璃加了螢石的成分，即變成乳白色，用以製造燈炮燈罩等等。</p>
<p>又當螢石和濃硫酸起作用，一種有奇臭的氣體即發生，如被水吸收則成濃氟氫酸，在以前這種液體專門用來蝕刻玻璃器皿和工業分析試藥，在過去的幾年漸漸消逝後，氟氫　也變成奇特了，那時，經過緊張的研究，產生了一種複雜的混合物呌做Freons，其中最成功的一氣體普通呌Fr2，它是完美的淸凉劑，此經濟的淸凉劑的發展，却要勝過室內所置的冰箱。</p>
<p>其他在商業上的氟礦有晶冰石（Cryolite），裹面含有鋁的混合物（氟化鈉鋁　Sodium　aluminam　flouride），也是製造鋁的電解質，格林蘭（Grecnland）是產冰晶石最多的地方，因爲它的重要，在大戰時常用特別的護送法，把它從格林蘭護送到美國，</p>
<p>最穢我們要看看氟的將來，研究物質學的科學家說是光明萬丈的。舉例來說，有人預言一個氟的混合物可以製造光滑的油，經久的抵禦在一個最崎嶇的現代機械，（而現在是不可能的沒有一種滑潤物可以抵禦可怕的壓力和麽擦）。像偶然的事，現在的氯氫酸可以在石油製煉所內煉成的高等汽油，氧化物加在水中後，可以防止牙齒的腐爛。</p>
<p>氟將要改製成一種氣體，在可驚的高電壓下是一個絕對的絕總體，而應用在頸代的X光和其他的電子工作上。氟另有一新的化學工具是金屬的氟硼虞墮（Fluoroborates）。其中氟硼酸鈉可以輸在樹上防止昆蟲的攻擊，並作爲淸潔劑來去除鐵上的銹，或淸潔石頭，三和土的表面，絕滅臭蟲和鼠等。氟硼酸鉀是用作焊劑，鎔接金屬的。</p>
<p>其他關係氟的製成品，像熱傳導體，優良的殺蟲劑，超級麻醉劑，剷野草物，絕緣橡皮，不怕火的物質，可塑體，燻蒸劑等都是。</p>
<p>科學辭典</p>
<h3>BCG—結核菌預防疫苗</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>BCG是英文Bacillus　Guerin的縮寫，直譯起來應該是卡默和蓋郞所發現的結核菌預防疫苗，這個名字是紀念四十年前的兩位法國科學家卡默GuA　Calmette）和蓋郞（CGuerin）。</p>
<p>卡，蓋兩氏最初以爲牛羣中肺癆猖獗非常，如果能够從病牛身上取出一部分病菌，使它漸漸任弱，使它的毒性降低，至注人人體後不能引起結核症爲止，那麽這種病菌也許可能刺激人體，產生一種强力的免疫體，像預防白喉天花一樣的功效。</p>
<p>這個理想是正確的，經過了長時期的工作，他們把牛身上分離出來的一個强毒病菌，放在含鵝百分之五甘油和牛膽汁的馬鈴薯培養劑盤裹，這樣工作了四年，已經得到了初步的成就，培養後的細菌已不再使動物引起結核症來，於是再經過十三年的研究，正式造成了BCG疫苗</p>
<p>在試騐BCG對黑猩猩（Chimpanzee）的反應成功以後，卡默氏不顧各方的責難，他給出生未久而與患有結核症的祖母同處的嬰兒，服下了少量的BCG，嬰孩很健康的長大了，至少證明了它的部分的效騐。</p>
<p>經過了科學家不斷的試騐，在二百萬以上的試用過BCG疫苗的嬰孩中，我們知道它雖非絕對能防癆，但絕大多數的人都已能免除結核，即使不幸而仍染上結核，情形也比較輕微，易於治療。可惜它只能預防結核，不能用於治療，對於已生過結核的人，不能應用，事實上，成人很少不被傳染着的，所以施用的對象，往往以嬰孩爲主。</p>
<p>現在上海巴斯德研究所（institut　Pasteur）對於BCG已在劉永純博士指導之下，加以硏究，誠我國醫藥界之佳音！</p>
<h3>英國國立物理實驗室的素描</h3>
<p>— 晨風</p>
<p>英國國立物理實騐室（BritlshNational　Physical　Laboratory）創立了四十六年，是世界著名的一個科學研究所，這是屬於理工硏究部（Science　and　Industrial　ReasearchDepartment）的，設立在倫敦近郊的塔定（Teddington），佔地六十餘英畝，領導這實騐室的是世第一流的理論物理學家查理。達爾文爵土（Sir　Dr.　Charles　Darwin）；他是偉大的生物學家達爾文（CharlesDarwin）的長孫。</p>
<p>這著名的實騐室是科學知識和日常生活的連繫，理論和實騐的媒介，科學和工商業的橋樑。</p>
<p>這實騐所分成十大部：就是物理部，工程部，電氣部，無錢電部，度量部，冶金部，光學部，航空力學部，船舶設計部，以及數學部，範　之廣，可以說是包羅萬象。</p>
<p>近世工業發展的前提是度量衡的進步，要衡定道些無數的度量單位的標準，決非私人企業所能勝任，這就是實騐室的重要工作之一，度發部保存着長度，質量和時問的標準單位，以及他們的衍化單位，如體積，密度，壓力等，長度的衡量可準至百萬分之一吋，電氣部則有一小組，專門硏究如何保存CGS制中電流，電壓和電阻等單位的標準，同時也有無綫電中單位的標準，如週率的比較，可比出千萬分之一的差別，物理部的聲學組硏究如何測量雜音，又有一放射學組負責英國的鐳錠標準（Radium　Standard），在一九三九年前，世界上的鐳有四分之一在這裏檢定。</p>
<p>除了標準的保存以外，各種工業原料特性的測定，也是重要工作之，例如工程部硏究材料的「疲乏」（Fatigue）和金屬的「爬」（Creep），後者就是在高溫度時，金屬受到各種力而發生的溢出現象，這種硏究，這實騐室是個先驅者，還有冶金部，硏究金屬和合金的物理性，如强度成分和結構等。</p>
<p>這裏所屬的各部，大多是廣泛而有一般性的，不過也有二個專門部—船舶設計部和無錢電部，船舶設計部硏究如何改進船型的設計和推進作用的改良，並且做了模型去試騐船舶的性質，這次大戰前，有百分之八十的商船，在這裏先用模型試騐，然後再造的，這樣，據估計，每年可節省一百萬噸燃料，這次大職在法國登睦時所用的麥勃來港（Mulberry　Harbour），也是在這裹國計劃決定的，至於無錢電部的工作，是研究無錢電的傳播，衰减，方向的找尋，空氣和游子氣層（Ionsphere）的性質等，戰爭中所用的雷達所以能成功，大都得力於這一部的硏究工作。</p>
<p>英國國立物理實騐室仍不斷地在生長着，一方面，每個部門的工作逐漸發展擴大，另一方面，有需要時，再添設部門，數學部就是新添的一個，它的任務，可分三點：一爲計算工作，倘若有某一工程題目，方程式已有，但需要大規模的計算，方可定出曲錢來應用，那就可託付這部去做，二為統計工作，三爲計算機的改進以及設計。</p>
<p>這實騐所是一個很大的機構，要詳細描敍，決非一篇短文所能做到，像航空力學部，光學部等，都有重要的工作，本文沒有介紹。總之，還是世界最大的研究所之一。世界公認它的價値和它的權威，而且可以發掏各方面的科學人才，工舉界將更多地向它豁詢，獲得寶貴的指導。</p>
<h3>細菌戰爭的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 瞿友仃</p>
<p>細菌戰爭一詞，也許早已爲人所熟悉了，這是一種與原子戰爭的恐怖性不相上下的戰術。在細菌戰爭中，當然主要的是利用細菌的侵入散佈來殺害敵人的，但是所用的細菌因為種種原因，亦頗有其限制；現在我們就來談談幾種適用於細菌戰爭的細菌吧</p>
<p>人類所最怕的霍亂菌，破傷風菌，傷寒菌，以及天花等等，首先就被列入不適用於細菌戰爭的各單之內，這主要的是因爲他們可以用注射防預針來免除的緣故。有些則因爲傳染性不修，易於診治，或是不能以人爲的方法散佈而被除名不用，剩下的只有二十一種病源菌可望用於戰爭。</p>
<p>已往在生物戰爭的題目下，提到的有一種名呌臘腸毒菌（Botulism）的罐頭食物毒藥菌，對於人的胃部毒性極大，設將此物三百五十磅滴入一千萬加侖的蓄水池中，則飲此水一滴即將殞命—據Roseburg及Kabat兩位博士說，這種東西也許可以用於戰爭。但是經過很多對於白鼠的經常試驗之後，始發覺白鼠能飲致人死命的水量的百分之一，而仍能不致死亡，久而久之，更預見飲水者可用最簡單的方法煮沸消毒，飲之無碍。　其實，可用於戰爭的細菌幾乎都是一些稀奇古怪甚少聞知的細菌。據報吿，曾在非洲於一九三〇年一度猖狂的鸚鵡熱就是一種，其他的像有一種名呌Meliodosis的「遠東病」，據可靠的醫學訊載，這種病直到一九三三年還只有九十五人患過。這些毒菌或桿菌都只能從生物實臉室中取得，且將有利於軍事用途，因爲病狀愈稀奇，治療愈困難之故，而這種傳染病才能侵害敵人。</p>
<p>比校熟悉而可用於普遍作戰的，有疗瘤菌（Anthrax），感冒菌，腦膜炎，肺炎瘟（Pneumonic　plague）等，肺炎瘟有「超級」武器之名，單獨的一個肺炎瘟桿菌就足以殺死一隻隊鼠，至於人類，也當是無法倖免的，這種細菌能在濃烟密霧中擴散，非僅及於空曠之地，甚至可從關閉之窗門鑽入。</p>
<p>至於細菌的投擲法，目前尙需研討，有一種全然可付諸實行而有利於軍事的方法，就是用飛機將緊閉的細菌盒子投出，一落地便能自動展開，擁出大羣身携細萬的昆蟲（如蚊蠅之類），利用其整刺而傳病。假若某種桿菌能抗拒爆炸的話，利用碎片飛彈手榴彈等，也可携運細菌而完成其侵染任務，通常非僅毒及人類，並可毒害需動物供給的肉類乳類，食品及工業產品等。這些當然也是細菌戰爭的普遍目標。</p>
<h3>小發明</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>電子隔牆窺視見美國奇異電氣公司（General　EleotricCo.）最近發明了一隻微波器；能修隔牆窺視，淸晰異常。這個窺視鏡組看好像一架炬光燈，用一百十伏特的交流電控制，裏面包括許多電子管，振蕩電路，變壓器，天錢以及反射器，裝在一隻箱子裏，一、共紙有四磅重。隔牆窥視鏡射出一股集中的高頻率的無綫電波，所以能够穿過像磚牆一類的障碍物，而從粗糙或暗黑的表面反射回來，一根金屬管子便把反射回來的光綫帶回鐘中。同時拋物反射鏡中的天綫便把這些反射回來的光錢感應下來，經過一個矽石檢波器，結果便在一個儀器上指示出來。電子隔牆窺視鏡在工業上有很大的用處，像計算，定向，開關，抹去，信號，限額，放映等等。</p>
<p>凍肉保藏新法凍魚凍肉，祇要在融解的玻璃臘音（Plastic　Wax）中一浸，便可省部了許多並不可靠的包裝，這是美國最新保藏冷食的方法。臘膏並不黏在食物表面，但能密不通風地附在上面，在低溫時比最好的油紙更爲牢固安全，隨便丢甩，並不脫落，凍肉可以經用一年以上。當你食用時，切開食品，便可甩小刀一括，臘靑便全部脫下。所以水果和蔬菜也能利用這個方法來保藏。</p>

<h3>Unified Military Deployment in North China:传Zuo Yi Appointed Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression; Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou and Baoding to be Abolished</h3>
<p>"Our Tianjin Dispatch, 30th" After Chairman Chiang's arrival in Beiping, a decision was made to unify military command in North China, establishing a command post for the five provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, to be headed by Fu Zuoyi. The original Suiyuan Headquarters in Baoding and Zhangjiakou will be abolished. After paying respects to Chairman Chiang, the Tianjin Garrison Commander Ma Fahu returned to Tianjin on the 30th to report that the Chairman expressed great concern for North China and gave detailed instructions on military and political work. With this thorough adjustment of military command in North China, the overall situation is expected to improve daily.</p>
<p>"Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 29th" According to reliable sources: Fu Zuoyi has been appointed Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in North China. Fu is currently making arrangements in Beiping. Jia Huang, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou, Wang Mingde, Secretary-General, and Xing Zhe, Chief of the Fourth Bureau (Logistics), have been ordered to proceed to Beiping immediately to make arrangements.</p>
<p>"Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 30th" After the news of Fu Zuoyi's appointment as Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in North China was released, all parties here were extremely excited upon hearing the news. It is reported that the new organization is currently being established. Its command area includes the four provinces of Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, as well as the section outside Shanhaiguan of the Beining Line. The Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou and Baoding will be abolished, and the military command system for bandit suppression in North China will be unified. Many senior staff members of the Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou have been summoned to Beiping to prepare plans. Director Fu is still staying in Beiping and has not returned.</p>
<p>"Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th" The Beiping Provisional Headquarters continued to hold military meetings this morning. Li Zongren, Xiong Shihui, Fu Zuoyi, Shangguan Yunxiang, Ma Fahu, Sun Lianzhong, Luo Zejun, Liu Guangji, and the five army commanders Hou Jingru, Zheng Zhenfeng, An Chunsheng, Yuan Pu, and Lin Weishu all attended. They discussed in detail the unification of military command in North China, the transfer and abolition of the existing Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou and Baoding, and the plan and arrangements for establishing a new organization. Fu Zuoyi was in contact with all parties all day today, and was extremely busy. The general work has been decided, and he will return to Zhangjiakou tomorrow or the day after to give instructions on the closing of the Suiyuan Headquarters, and then return to Beiping to preside over the establishment of the new organization, while also serving as Deputy Director of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters. There will be no changes in the Chahar administration. Sun Yunzhong will continue to be in charge of Hebei. After the Suiyuan Headquarters organization is adjusted, he will also serve as Deputy Director of the Provisional Headquarters. This afternoon, Mr. Sun attended the Hebei Provincial Provisional Assembly, explaining the difficulties of the military and political situation in Hebei Province, and expressing his regret to the elders of Hebei.</p>
<p>"Another Dispatch" Fu Zuoyi received the five army commanders Hou Jingru, Lin Weichou, Yuan Pu, An Chunsheng, and Zheng Zhenfeng in Beiping at 9:00 a.m. today, and then attended the military meeting of the Provisional Headquarters. At 2:00 p.m., he left Beiping for Langfang to inspect the defense area of his 35th Army, and returned to Beiping at 4:30 p.m. In the evening, he hosted a banquet for the generals. Mr. Fu will return to Zhangjiakou tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Battle for Yuanshi Reaches its Climax</h3>
<p>"Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th" Official sources confirm: The National Army is still firmly defending Yuanshi City. Communications were once interrupted, but external contact was restored yesterday. Wei Yonghe, commander of the defending regiment, stated in a telegram that the bandit army's offensive has gradually eased in the past two days, and there has been no fierce fighting. The invading bandit forces are currently gathering in the suburbs, awaiting reinforcements to defend the city. They hope that the air force will provide a large amount of supplies by air and bomb the bandit positions.</p>
<p>"Another Dispatch" It is reported that the Communist bandits outside Baoding are frequently moving. The air force dispatched bombers yesterday to bomb the remaining bandits in the Wangdu and Mancheng areas. Two bandit warehouses were set on fire yesterday. There are also reports that the National Army in Baoding and Yuan planned a southward attack on Fangshun Bridge, but this is inaccurate. Several hundred bandits attacked Dada Ran south of Baoding and Yuan last night but failed and retreated. It is also learned that a large bandit detachment in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has recently been reduced in strength in Yu Du Jian Ke Hua, and there are attempts to attack Jinghai. The National Army is closely monitoring.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Baoding, 30th" The battle for Yuanshi is becoming more and more fierce. The bandits have suffered extremely heavy casualties due to repeated bombing and strafing by the air force, but the bandit forces at the four passes have continued to fiercely attack the city walls day and night. The defending army is desperately defending and fiercely counterattacking. The bandits have repeatedly approached the city, attempting to destroy the city walls with explosives, but were completely annihilated. The great battle for Yuanshi has reached its climax, and the morale of the defending army is extremely high.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Baoding, 30th" The peace between Beiping and Baoding is becoming increasingly consolidated. There are no large bandit forces near Dingxing and Zhuozhou counties. With the smooth progress of the military, passenger trains have reached Gucheng. The northbound army from Baoding has reached Caohe. There are still bandit activities between Xushui and Caohe, making repairs inconvenient. The National Army has dispatched troops to clear out the remaining bandits in the area, and the Beiping-Baoding line will soon be open to traffic.</p>
<h3>The National Army in Western Shandong Continues to Advance; Bandits in Northern Anhui Cross the Sha River and Flee Southwest</h3>
<p>"Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 30th" There are no more traces of bandits in the Jinxiang and Yutai areas. The National Army is advancing towards Shanxian and Chengwu. The National Army in northern Anhui continues to pursue and剿 the bandits in Shenqiu and Jieshou. The remnants of Chen bandit's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns have crossed the Sha River and fled southwest.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 30th" On the 29th, the National Army's naval and air forces patrolled the bandit situation on both sides of the Sha River and discovered a pontoon bridge covered with straw and dozens of bandit boats southeast of Jiemu. There were also circular fortifications south of the bridge, and bombs were dropped to destroy them.</p>
<p>"Our Hankou Dispatch, 30th" Military News: The Liu bandit's 1st Column, which fled north from Huang'an and Macheng, has suffered heavy casualties due to the combined efforts of the National Army to encircle and suppress them. They are now encircled in the Luo Chen Dian and Ding Yuan Dian areas north of Jing Fu and Xuan Hua Dian. The National Army is launching a sweeping campaign. In addition, the main force of the bandit's 3rd Column briefly captured Macheng on the evening of the 28th, but were quickly surrounded and expelled by the National Army, and the remaining bandits fled towards Shangcheng.</p>
<p>"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" On the afternoon of the 29th, a certain unit of the National Army arrived in the area north of Lushi, and another unit arrived at Shangge, northeast of Lushi. The bandits in Lushi are now under pressure and are showing signs of fleeing east.</p>
<p>"Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 30th" The bandit forces in Yiyongjingfu and other counties are still rampant. The National Army is deploying forces to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Northeast of Jimo</h3>
<p>"Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 30th" Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Youqian, Jinkou, and Xianyou areas northeast of Jimo in Jiaodong. The 7th and 9th Columns of the bandits have suffered heavy casualties. There have also been small-scale battles outside Haiyang Lianri.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Peng's Bandits Near Yulin Flee into the Mountains</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th" The remnants of Peng Dehuai's bandit army, defeated by the National Army near Yulin, have retreated to the Dachuan area north of Jiaocheng. Their 15th Regiment and the 6th Detachment of Jiaocheng are scattered bandits who are causing trouble in the mountains between Jiaocheng and Wenshui. Another unit of the bandit army, the newly formed 3rd Brigade, is causing trouble in the mountains west and northwest of Lingshi. The National Army and our local patrol teams are closely monitoring them.</p>
<h3>Li Jingqi Departs Today to Comfort the Wanshi Local Militia</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th" Minister Li Jingqi has been ordered to comfort the people's militia in the Wanshi area. He will fly to Hankou by special plane tomorrow, then transfer to Nanyang, to distribute 300 million yuan in bonuses to the militia and 300 million yuan in relief funds to the disaster-stricken people. There are also 500,000 rounds of ammunition, 20,000 hand grenades, and 1,000 mortar shells, which will be directly distributed by the Joint Logistics Headquarters. Mr. Li will also go to Kaifeng to discuss with Chairman Liu Maoen the methods of rewarding meritorious officers and soldiers. Accompanying Mr. Li on the mission are Guo Dequan, Military Counselor of the National Government; Li Yaxian, Standing Committee Member of the Constitutional Promotion Association; Ji Zhisheng and Yao Tingfang, Resident Members of the Political Participation Council; Huang Jian, Section Chief of the Ministry of National Defense; Du Guangyuan, Secretary of the Ministry of Land Affairs; Zhou Xi, Reporter of the Heping Daily; and Yang Baodong and Li Hongwu, representatives from Wanshi. Mr. Li and his party will return to Nanjing in about a week.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Policy: No Changes in the Near Future</h3>
<p>"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" Regarding foreign exchange policy, there have been various rumors circulating recently. A reporter interviewed an economic authority today, who stated that there would be no changes in foreign exchange policy in the near future. He analyzed the reasons, stating that some have advocated implementing a fully open policy, allowing the market to determine prices. When implementing openness, market prices may rise sharply once, and in theory, they may gradually fall thereafter. However, the government is unwilling to take this great risk, fearing that once fully opened, it will be impossible to control. Although the current daily announcement of exchange rates is not a perfect policy, it is not the worst option either. The rise in prices is also gradual, so there will be no changes in foreign exchange policy in the near future.</p>
<h3>Our Representative to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Issues Important Statement: Supports Establishment of Various Specialized Committees</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Baguio, 29th" The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) discussed its methods and powers on the 29th. The Chinese representative, Li Gan, representing the Chinese government, issued an important statement on this issue, stating that the meeting could not address the issues hoped for by the people in this region because it was not a working group. However, the various economic needs of Asian and Far Eastern countries must be submitted by this commission to the Economic and Social Council, other United Nations agencies, and member states of the United Nations in order to obtain priority consideration and action. Mr. Li pointed out that the meeting should focus its efforts on a number of important issues so that it can complete its analysis and recommendations within a reasonable time. In his statement, Mr. Li supported the opinion of establishing various specialized committees within the ECAFE, and strongly suggested that the ECAFE should not wait for the completion of the commission's structure, but should immediately begin drafting some recommendations for economic construction. This recommendation is based on available materials. Li Gan supported the recommendations made by the ECAFE Secretariat, which advocated the establishment of a commodity committee to facilitate agreements between countries on the allocation and supply of scarce commodities. Mr. Li also suggested that a construction committee be established under the ECAFE, which should include government officials handling construction matters in the delegations of the next ECAFE meeting. Regarding the exchange of economic information, Mr. Li asked the committee to pay attention to two points: 1. The statistical standards of Western countries cannot be applied to most parts of the Far East, so the relevant implementation policies and measures will sometimes have to be determined based on approximate figures. 2. Although the ECAFE is not an organization that engages in practical work, it must strictly prevent it from becoming an academic or super-research organization. We must work so that the people of Asia and the Far East can have a better and richer life in the future.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Membership Issue to be Re-Discussed</h3>
<p>"Central News Agency, Baguio, 29th" The issue of Indonesian participation will be raised again in the ECAFE next week. It is expected that the Chinese recommendation will be considered again, that is, the case of the Dutch and Indonesians separately requesting to obtain the qualifications of supporting member states should be postponed.

<p>"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" The Kuomintang Central Party has decided to send a telegram to all provincial and municipal party departments stating: "All comrades of our party must absolutely abide by the principle of party nomination, otherwise, even if elected, it will be invalid." When implementing this order, party departments in various provinces and cities will, in accordance with the party nomination method, notify the election offices to revoke the nomination of all party members who have not been nominated by the Central Committee, or who have been nominated as candidates, and who have been freely elected as formal members after the election.

<h3>Number of Seats for the Democratic and Youth Parties in Local Consultative Assemblies Awaiting Further Discussion</h3>
<p>"Our Report" Although the participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties in the consultative assemblies of various provinces and cities has been agreed upon in principle, technical details still need to be discussed. Because the initial consultation resulted in the two parties being able to propose one-fifth of the seats, but if this percentage is proposed based on the current number of consultative assemblies in various places, then after participation, it will be one-sixth of the total number, not one-fifth. This point was not noticed during the initial consultations, but because this matter will affect the number of future supervisors, the two parties have requested further consultations.</p>
<p>"Our Jinan Dispatch, 30th" The Jinan Journalists Association has repeatedly telegraphed the government, arguing that it is unfair to include Shandong, a pacification area, in the eastern region for the election of national delegates for journalists, along with provinces and cities that have been completely restored. They requested that it be reassigned to the northern region and that the voting rights of journalists' associations in counties and cities that have not been restored be retained. The provincial and municipal councils also advocated the same, but to no avail. They hereby declare their abandonment of voting rights.</p>

<p>"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" In order to cope with the current soaring prices, the authorities have decided to deal with the matter politically in order to quickly suppress and stabilize them. A responsible person emphasized this point when speaking to reporters on the 30th. He said: The price problem can be divided into two aspects. One is the economic factor, which is an inevitable phenomenon at present. The other is the human factor. In the soaring prices of the previous month, the human factor accounted for a greater proportion, so the government has decided to deal with the matter politically.</p>

Mr. Li and others returned to China from Bangkok on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Japanese Peace Treaty at a Standstill; Secretary Marshall Plans to Hold Private Talks to Find a Breakthrough; Soviet Suggestions Aim to Delay</h3>
<p>"United Press, Washington, 29th" The Soviet Union's demand that the four powers formulate the Japanese peace treaty has blocked the United States' four-month effort to resolve the Japanese peace treaty today. Whether to continue negotiations with other allied countries in the Pacific depends on whether the Soviet Union needs to participate, and no decision has been made at this time. Diplomats expect that Secretary of State Marshall may break the deadlock by holding private talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin during the current four-foreign ministers meeting. The negotiating situation will remain at a standstill until Secretary Marshall submits his report or the four foreign ministers in London conclude their meeting.</p>
<p>"United Press, Grinnell, Iowa, 30th" Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said yesterday at the Grinnell College Institute of International Affairs that the Soviet Union has obstructed the opportunity for an early conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty, and that the establishment of an independent organization in Korea has been hampered to date. Mr. Gu hinted that the Soviet Union is assisting the Chinese Communists in the civil war, and said that China needs assistance, and the sooner the assistance, the better for world peace. The Far East issue is as important as the European issue. The Communists in North China and Northeast China are not completely detached from foreign ideas and assistance.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th" British and American people here believe that the Soviet Union's note to China suggesting that a special meeting of the four foreign ministers be held in China in January next year to initially discuss the Japanese peace treaty indicates that the Soviet Union is still determined to delay the signing of the peace treaty as much as possible.</p>
<p>"Reuters, London, 29th" The Far East peace treaty was mentioned twice in today's foreign ministers' meeting, which made people increasingly believe that Molotov will make the German and Japanese peace treaties difficult. When Molotov opposed the idea of establishing a German regional government today, he said: The whole of Germany, the whole of Europe, and the whole world, including Japan, urgently need peace. This statement indicates that the Soviet Union will demand the acceleration of discussions on the Japanese peace treaty. And if the German government is allowed to participate in the creation of the peace treaty before the allied countries agree on the German peace treaty, it will be an important precedent, allowing Japan to demand similar rights when formulating the Far East peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Twelve Former US Ambassadors to Foreign Countries Jointly Urge Military Aid to China: Telegram Sent to the Foreign Affairs Committees of Both Houses and Secretary Marshall</h3>
<p>"United Press, New York, 29th" Twelve former US ambassadors to foreign countries sent a joint telegram to the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and Secretary of State Marshall on the 29th, urging military equipment and financial and economic aid to China. The telegram stated: We believe that if China falls under the control of the Soviet Union, the important interests of the United States will be seriously threatened, so we strongly urge you to provide the Chinese government with the necessary military equipment and financial and economic assistance. The signatories of this telegram are former Ambassador to Poland Bullitt, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen, former Ambassador to Chile Collier, former Ambassador to Mexico Daniels, former Ambassador to Paraguay Frost, former Ambassador to Germany Shotwell, former Ambassador to Panama Hibbard, former Ambassador to Norway Osborne, former Ambassador to Italy Phillips, former Ambassador to Turkey Skinner, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, and former Ambassador to Spain Weddell.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, San Francisco, 30th" The non-partisan Seattle Times today strongly urged the congressional representatives of Washington State to support New York Governor Dewey's request for immediate aid to China, and urged the House Foreign Affairs Committee to build a trace of US$60 million in interim aid to China. The newspaper's editorial was titled "China Should Not Be Forgotten" and expressed regret that President Truman did not mention China in his message to Congress. It praised Dewey's request to include China in the US foreign aid plan, and said: "If Truman and his advisors have neglected the urgent needs of China and its importance to the Western Hemisphere and Western culture, then the people of the American Pacific Northwest have not neglected the significance of preserving China as a potential democratic nation, which has a profound meaning for our own economic and political future. Therefore, the general public wants to include China in the relief plan, and the emotion is extremely strong. The congressional representatives of this state should take the lead in supporting the amendment to the foreign aid plan proposed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee for China."</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, New York, 29th" There is a growing number of people discussing aid to China in the United States. Most discussions focus on the Republican Party's insistence on giving equal weight to aid to China and aid to Western Europe. In terms of domestic politics, just in New York alone, there are five well-known commentators writing articles commenting on the China issue, including columnists Krock of the New York Times, Sullivan and Sokolsky of the Forward Forum, Elliott of the Post, and Grafton. The main points of their comments are as follows: (Continued on page two)</p>
<h3>A View of Shandong Province from Jiaodong: A Comprehensive Report from Our Jinan Correspondent, Li Tian</h3>
<p>"Aeronautical News from Our Jinan Office, 28th of the Month": Even now, the "Three Mountains" (namely, Dazeshan Mountain northeast of Pingdu, Juchiya Mountain southeast of Xixia, and Kunyu Mountain southeast of Muping) remain the largest strongholds of the Lu Communists in Jiaodong. The former was once entirely recovered by the National Army, and part of Juchiya Mountain was also recovered by the National Army. However, since the local guerrilla forces of the Communists far outnumbered the local teams of the National Army, the Communist guerrillas, mainly engaged in guerrilla warfare, coordinated with the Communist regular army's Second, Seventh, Ninth, and Thirteenth Corps, as well as part of the Fourth Corps, mainly engaged in mobile warfare. Taking advantage of the gap when part of the National Army was successively transferred south after settling the Jiaodong region, they launched offensives one after another, infiltrating Yexian, Pingdu, Jiaoxian, Shouguang, and the Fanjiaji area southeast of Changyi. They then launched a siege to probe Gaomi. However, under the National Army's mobile deployment and flexible operations, although the Communists gained some small advantages in certain minor battles, strategically, the occupation of key ports such as Longkou, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, and the recovery of most towns in eastern Liaoning, cut off the Lu Communists' international connection and reduced their source of manpower and food. This made the Communists deeply feel the "difficulty in obtaining food" and the "lack of shoes, clothing, and blankets." In the end, even Su Yu, Chen Yi's deputy, had to issue the lament "Counter-offensive, counter-offensive, Shandong is lost!" The widespread decline in their morale and the broadly deepened sense of failure are not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>However, the capture of several important points and lines must not be regarded as "the final blow at the end of the Shandong campaign." The Lu Communist guerrillas still have as many as ninety-six regiments today. In the past, the central government established sixteen security regiments for Shandong, but in reality, over the past year, the central government has ordered Shandong to allocate as many as twenty-eight regiments of the National Army's regular troops. This resulted in the landlord forces, which Chairman Wang Yaowu had painstakingly rebuilt, becoming the National Army, far deviating from the inherent principles of "guns not leaving the person, the person not leaving the village, and not abandoning production." Therefore, as far as Shandong is concerned, some non-strategic towns had to be temporarily and painfully abandoned voluntarily.</p>
<p>To ensure that the people can smoothly return to their hometowns and reorganize, it is necessary to match force with force. Although the National Army's regular troops are more than capable of dealing with the Communist field armies and their corps, if the government's local teams are not cultivated to a level capable of dealing with the Communist guerrillas, it would be like a cripple with only one leg, unable to operate freely and effectively in combat. Currently, there are about thirty regiments of Shandong local forces undergoing continued training.</p>
<p>When the Communists withdrew from southern Shandong and the Yimeng Mountain area in central Shandong, they destroyed everything in the same way. In the Yimeng Mountain area, it is often the case that one cannot see any sign of human habitation or a complete house for hundreds of miles. The weeds grow taller than the trees, even more desolate than the areas around Ruijin and Ningdu in Jiangxi in previous years. But all of this is not a big deal. If you travel to the areas of Dancheng, Juye, Jinxiang, Chengwu, Yutai, Shanxian, and Caoxian in southwestern Shandong, it would be like visiting an ancient battlefield. The county seats here have been lost at least four times, usually six or seven times, and the most is Dancheng, which has been lost a total of nine times. Of the county magistrates appointed by the Shandong provincial government, three were killed in battle, two were captured, and the most recent one also requested to resign due to being overwhelmed by the hardship. Therefore, serving as a county magistrate in Shandong is generally regarded as a "candidate for martyrdom." Now, in the recovered areas of western Shandong, it is extremely difficult to even find a table or a stool, because these had long been used as firewood by the Red bandits during numerous "seesaw battles." The garrison and the common people alike sit on the ground and sleep on the ground, building grass sheds next to broken bricks, dilapidated walls, and ruined rubble to shelter from the wind and rain. Some restored elementary schools can only conduct classes in the open air, teaching by drawing on the ground.</p>
<p>Since southwestern Shandong is the only transportation hub for Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng to reach northern Shandong and southern Hebei after the National Army settled central Shandong and Jiaodong, this area has also become their most important supply base. For the bandits, it is imperative to defend it, and for the National Army, in order to coordinate with future encirclement and suppression plans against the Communist bandits in the Central Plains, this area has become "attacking what they must defend"!</p>
<p>After the Yellow River freezes, it may provide some convenience to the Communists in terms of material supply and troop movement. Therefore, some people have begun to worry whether the Communists will launch a siege against Jinan, following the example of Shijiazhuang. After the reporter inquired with relevant parties, it was unanimously believed that the possibility was very small.</p>
<p>However, as Commander Wang Yaowu told this newspaper's reporter, "We have already begun to make the most active preparations for manpower, equipment, and food. The city defense fortifications have also been strengthened. We should do as Sun Tzu said, 'Do not rely on the enemy not coming, but rely on our preparedness to meet them.'"</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Preliminary Conference for the Peace Treaty with Japan After the Soviet Union's Reply to Our Country's Proposal</h3>
<p>In order to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union on the procedures for the peace treaty with Japan, our government sent notes to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on November 17, proposing that a preliminary conference for the peace treaty with Japan be organized by the member states of the Far Eastern Commission, with the four major powers retaining the right of veto. This newspaper's editorial on November 21 pointed out that the submission of this proposal during the London Foreign Ministers' Conference indicated that although the issue of the peace treaty procedures with Japan had fallen into a deadlock, there was still a path to be taken. China's proposal was highly compromising, and was a reasonable and constructive plan in terms of reconciling the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union and respecting the status of the other eight countries. The opinions of many countries were the same as our observations, with the same hopes, and expectations for a practical reply from the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, the Soviet Union's reply was submitted on November 28, which seemed to be possibly close to our country's proposal, but greatly different from the United States' opinion. Various different reactions have been issued by public opinion in the United Kingdom and the United States. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have not yet made any formal statements on the Chinese and Soviet notes. How will this deadlock be broken? It is generally felt that it is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Soviet government's reply to our government's note is also a kind of proposal in nature, but it firmly insists that the peace treaty with Japan be discussed by the foreign ministers of the four major powers, rejecting consultations with the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, and has not changed its previous stance. The only point on which the Soviet Union's reply is relatively close to our country's is the maintenance of the four major powers' right of veto. What the Soviet Union's reply has not agreed upon with our country's proposal is the issue of joint consultations by the Far Eastern Commission. What the Soviet Union proposed should be welcomed by our country is that the preliminary conference for the peace treaty should be held in China, with the time being January of next year. Therefore, we say that the opinions of China and the Soviet Union have become closer than before, but not completely close. In the eyes of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union's proposal is not a new opinion, it is still a revision of the opinions of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, so news from Washington indicates a cold reception. Summarizing the attitudes and stances of the four countries, three different plans have now been produced regarding the convening of a preliminary conference for the peace treaty with Japan. The deadlock seems to have entered a more complex stage, without any signs of being eliminated or simplified. The attitudes and stances of the United Kingdom and the United States have formed one plan, and China and the Soviet Union each hold a plan. The location and time of the conference seem to be of little relevance. The points of contention among the three different plans still lie in the issue of convening and drafting by four countries or eleven countries, and whether the four countries' right of veto should be maintained. This is a dispute over the procedures of the peace conference, and also a dispute over the rights of the major powers. We are concerned about this issue, and would like to restate our opinions as follows:</p>
<p>First, the issue of convening and drafting by four countries or eleven countries. We agree with the government's proposition that the preliminary conference for the peace treaty should be organized by the Far Eastern Commission. The war against Japan was a war in the Far East and the Pacific. The contributions of the eleven countries of the Far East to defeating Japan, although different due to the order in which they joined the war and the severity of the losses in the campaigns, are consistent in their contribution to preventing aggression. Furthermore, they have a precedent for signing the Japanese surrender terms, so they should not be excluded from discussing the peace treaty. In terms of legal principles, the Far Eastern Commission was created by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference in December 1945, and was endorsed by the Chinese government. Since February 26, 1946, the Far Eastern Commission has been working to control Japan and rebuild peace in the Far East, and should naturally be responsible for the preliminary matters of the peace treaty with Japan. Admittedly, the organization of the Far Eastern Commission was proposed by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, as a coordination of the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union at the time. Molotov reluctantly accepted it, and it was naturally not the organization that the Soviet Union ideally wanted to control Japan. However, today, as the organization of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is becoming increasingly limited to a few members and its nature is becoming increasingly autocratic, with the rights and status of China and France both facing severe restrictions, in order to strengthen international cooperation and rebuild peace in the Far East, it is indeed a strategy that respects the rights and status of the majority of countries to have the eleven countries jointly responsible for the preliminary matters of the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>Second, the issue of the right of veto of the four major powers. The right of veto is the right of agreement of the major powers. It is not only present at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but also at the meetings of the Far Eastern Commission, where the four countries of the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union also have it. Our government respects the form of the Far Eastern Commission and opposes the United Kingdom and the United States only adopting a two-thirds majority decision, precisely in order to maintain the tradition of the four major powers retaining the right of veto. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France all retain the right of veto for the peace treaty with Germany; therefore, China should also retain the right of veto for the peace treaty with Japan. The right of veto is our guarantee, and our country must safeguard it. The peace treaty with Japan is more important to our country's future survival than to any other country. In order to uphold the United Nations Charter and safeguard the country's interests, we do not avoid being suspected of siding with the Soviet Union, and firmly advocate the four powers' right of agreement, i.e., the right of veto of one country. Our country's proposal that the peace treaty with Japan be prepared jointly by eleven countries, with the condition of retaining the four powers' right of agreement, is in accordance with legal principles and adapts to the situation. We hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will be mutually tolerant and accommodating, taking the strengths of each other's different plans and seeking a compromise, so that all deadlocks can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>The path to breaking the deadlock is not very difficult. As long as the Soviet Union agrees to convening by eleven countries and does not adhere to the proposition of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the United Kingdom and the United States agree to the four powers' right of agreement and abandon the preconceived notion of a simple two-thirds majority decision, the deadlock will be broken. Resolving international disputes depends on compromise between countries. Roosevelt's ideal of the United Nations is to have sincerity and fairness as the highest realm. We read Byrnes' "Speaking Frankly" and deeply feel that the politicians and diplomats of powerful countries seem to lack the compromising nature needed to resolve international disputes. We are deeply concerned about the future of international cooperation. We would like to reiterate our position here: China's proposal contains compromise and is constructive. We hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will reconsider it calmly and seek a path to breaking the deadlock!</p>

<h3>Calls for U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Mr. Krock, the most experienced and conservative journalist in American domestic news, believes that the call for aid to China by New York Governor Dewey and other congressional Republican leaders is a mixture of Republican political planning and genuine concern about the threat of the spread of communist forces in Asia. The Republican stance on the China issue has formed a debate on foreign policy, and in this regard, the Republican Party is able to lead the Democratic Party for the first time in several years, moving toward a common goal, rather than simply following behind. The Republican Party finds it difficult to follow the Democratic government on the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, but the Republican Party's concern for China and its proposal for aid, while the government focuses on Western Europe, are points of departure on this issue. However, U.S. policy toward China will not develop into a direct dispute between the two major parties. The government may not consider China's future to be as important to the United States as Europe's. The government's view is that the first thing to do should be done first, not that the second thing is secondary, but that the second thing can wait until the foundation for completing the first thing has been laid.</p>
<p>Sullivan, a Republican and close friend of Hoover, and a so-called old Republican, attaches great importance to Dewey's speech on aid to China. He believes that Dewey's speech on the 24th and the $60 million emergency aid to China proposal put forward by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 25th are in agreement. However, the latter is an action by congressional Republicans to express unanimous support for the proposal put forward by the Governor of New York, who is also the nominal leader of the Republican Party. In any case, this is a non-trivial development. Resistance to communism on a worldwide basis has become the policy of the Republican Party, and this policy is more complete and sufficient than the policy held by the government. The Republican Party's new policy is by no means contrary to the government's policy.</p>
<p>Sokolsky, who had close relations with the Chinese Communist Party from 1919 to 1931, and who is now an outspoken critic of international communism, called on the United States to transfer the surplus war materials stored in the Atlantic region to Chairman Chiang. He said: Chairman Chiang is actually fighting to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>Grafton, who is recognized as a liberal and a loyal supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal, believes that Dewey's advocacy of aid to China is for his own political gain. He said: The U.S. government has not forgotten China.</p>
<p>Elliott, nominally a military analyst and commentator, but who also often touches on diplomatic issues, reiterated his argument that the United States must focus its limited resources on the reconstruction of Western Europe, and should not attempt to aid both Europe and China at the same time, thereby exhausting its energy.</p>
<p>Although the above opinions do not represent everything, they can reflect the main differences of opinion among people of all walks of life in the United States regarding the relative importance of Europe and China in the U.S. plan. Secondly, due to the comments from the Republican side inside and outside Congress, a higher degree of interest in the China issue has been aroused among Americans, because the Republican side has criticized the government's China policy, criticizing its lack of a China policy. Third, with the U.S. presidential election just around the corner, one party or both parties may try to take advantage of domestic and foreign issues as much as possible for its own political effect, and seek advantages by attacking what it considers to be loopholes in the other party's policies or government affairs.</p>

<h3>UN General Assembly Concludes; Partition Plan for Holy Land Finally Passed; Arab Representatives Group Exits the Venue</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 30th] The United Nations 1947 General Assembly has concluded. Although the situation showed a slight improvement due to cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Palestine partition case, the two major powers clashed almost everywhere on other important issues. The US-Soviet dispute will continue to emerge in the London Foreign Ministers Conference. Assembly President Aranha announced the closing of the session after presiding over the opening ceremony for seventy-four days, six hours, and fifty-eight minutes, and stated that this session must advance the world "into peace, or it will be a dispute". Aranha had stated yesterday that the world is watching the London Conference, and he requested the participating countries to seek the right path to peace. Lie stated: "Human evolution is not divided by era or territory, but war can be prohibited, especially since humanity's ultimate goal is peace, and agreement on peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Japan will be a concrete step in coordination on other issues."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing, 29th] The UN General Assembly recently passed the Palestine partition plan by a vote of 33 to 13. China, the United Kingdom, and ten other countries abstained, and Siam was absent. The Holy Land will be divided into two independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationally administered city of Jerusalem. The United Nations will select a committee to go to the Holy Land to implement the partition plan, which is scheduled to be completed on August 1, 1948. The affirmative votes of France, Haiti, Liberia, and the Philippines were the reason for the majority exceeding two-thirds. Before the vote, Lebanese representative Chamoun proposed a six-point federal plan as a compromise solution in order to prevent the passage of the partition plan, advocating the establishment of a Palestinian federation with governments in both Jewish and Arab states. Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union both believed that the proposal was not a compromise and demanded an immediate vote on the partition plan.</p>
<p>The General Assembly then appointed Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Panama, and the Philippines as members of the United Nations Committee to assume responsibility for the implementation of the partition plan. When the voting result was announced, applause thundered in the audience. More than a dozen Jews could not contain themselves and wept, while Arab representatives stood up to protest. Syrian representative Khoury immediately announced that Arabs and Muslims around the world would obstruct the implementation of the partition, and said that all of Asia and its 1 billion people would oppose partition, while the Jewish state would be located at the gateway to Asia. Husseini, Vice Chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, also declared, "This is a resolution on paper, it must be implemented in Palestine, I hope you will live to see the outbreak of bloodshed!" Representatives from Iraq and Syria stated that they had hoped for justice, but today this belief has been destroyed. The Charter has been murdered, and everyone knows who the criminals are, and our government will not recognize this resolution, nor will it be responsible for the consequences caused by this resolution. After the Arab representatives protested, they exited the venue as a group.</p>
<h3>Signs of Riots in the Holy Land; Arabs Grieved, Jews Celebrated Wildly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 30th] Today, five Jews have been killed. Jews immediately declared that Arabs had first used violence after the United Nations decided to partition Palestine. British troops immediately isolated traffic between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Jews celebrated wildly all night, while the Arab areas were silent. However, Arabs held demonstrations in the town of Nablus, halfway between Jerusalem and Haifa, with large numbers of Arabs listening to speeches advocating resistance to the partition. Demonstrators telegraphed Archbishop Husseini, stating, "We are prepared to shed blood" to prevent Palestine from being split into Jewish and Arab states. Husseini is currently in Damascus and is said to be planning to attend the Palestinian Higher Arab Committee. The enthusiasm of the Jewish celebration was only seen since 1917 when British General Allenby liberated the Holy Land. Jews shouted "Long live the Jewish state", and even mocked the British royal family, but no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>UN Committee Headquarters to be Established in Tel Aviv; Arabs Express Refusal to Cooperate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing, 30th] After the UN General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, the question now facing the United Nations is how to implement it. The next step should be to appoint representatives from Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Panama, and the Philippines as members of the United Nations Committee to carry out the implementation of the partition plan. Once the members are determined, they will be assigned secretaries and other staff and depart for Palestine. It is said that the headquarters of the committee will be located in the city of Tel Aviv, in order to liaise with the Jewish defense forces on the takeover of the British troops, and to contact Jewish councils, the Jewish National Committee and other groups to lay the foundation for the establishment of a Jewish provisional government committee. Since the Arab representatives have clearly refused to cooperate with the United Nations Committee, responsible observers predict that the Arabs of Palestine will establish their own provisional government and do their best to occupy the land of Palestine.</p>
<h3>Egypt on High Alert to Prevent Anti-Jewish Riots</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 30th] After the news of the UN General Assembly's passage of the Palestine partition plan arrived, the Egyptian government immediately declared all national police forces on emergency status to prevent possible anti-Jewish riots.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 30th] An official spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry recently declared that the United Nations' partition of Palestine is "a signal of war, not only in Arab countries, but also in other countries around the world." He stated that Arab countries do not recognize the United Nations' binding force.</p>
<h3>UNESCO Condemns War Profiteers; UNESCO Passes French Amendment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 30th Broadcast: Mexico City, regarding the "war profiteer" case, UNESCO unanimously passed a French amendment on Saturday, based on a Polish motion, which "considers war to be unavoidable." The original proposal advocated taking "legal" action against "war profiteers."</p>
<h3>Marshall and Bevin Invite Soviet Foreign Minister to Dinner</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] State Secretary Marshall has invited Foreign Minister Molotov to dinner on Monday night. It is still uncertain whether the Soviet side will accept the invitation. Foreign Secretary Bevin had a dinner with Bidault last week and invited both of them last night.</p>
<h3>Dalton Delivers Speech; Britain Passes Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Newcastle, 30th] Dalton gave his first public speech since resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer here yesterday to two thousand unemployed workers and their families, declaring that the worst period of Britain's economic crisis has passed. He said that we are at a watershed in the post-war world, we have already climbed the ridge, and the path down the mountain will be easier from now on. It is expected that from 1948 onwards, Britain's industrial output will gradually increase, allowing imports to increase and people to obtain adequate standards of clothing and food.</p>
<h3>Pakistan Participates in Peace Conference on Germany; Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement; Soviets Insist on Establishing Central German Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] The four foreign ministers have met four times to discuss agenda issues, and only two points have been agreed upon today: They agreed to recognize Pakistan as an allied nation and allow it to submit opinions on the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany. It was agreed that after the foundation of the peace treaty with Germany is established, the countries that will attend the peace conference will be discussed. Other discussions are still focused on whether to discuss the central German government first, or to discuss the preparation of the peace treaty first.</p>
<p>The positions of the four foreign ministers are described as follows: Bevin's proposed plan advocates for a proper German government first, to submit opinions on the peace treaty and sign the peace treaty. Bidault advocates discussing the peace treaty first, believing that setting up a government first poses a danger to the content of the peace treaty. Marshall believes that drafting the peace treaty is the most urgent matter, but he also said that the peace treaty and the government cannot be mutually dependent. Molotov still insists that there must be a German government first before discussing the peace treaty.</p>
<p>The four foreign ministers first discussed Document No. 78 on the peace treaty procedure from the previous Moscow Conference today. The first point of contention was whether Albania and Pakistan should be allowed to submit opinions on the peace treaty. Molotov advocated allowing the two countries to submit opinions, while Marshall said that he could not recognize that Albania had a state of war with Germany, so he could not accept Albania. Molotov replied that Albania had fought against the Axis powers. Bevin also opposed Albania, pointing out that Britain had not yet established good relations with Albania, so he proposed that the Albanian issue be discussed at a later date and that Pakistan be allowed to participate first. Molotov nodded in agreement, and the case was resolved. The four foreign ministers then entered into a discussion of which should come first, the peace conference or the German government. Foreign Secretary Bevin made the following suggestions in order to speed up the discussion: A representative of the German government should express opinions at the peace conference, the peace treaty should be signed by a German government, and the peace treaty must be approved by Germany. Bevin also advocated that the issues of expressing opinions, signing, and approval should be left for discussion at the end of the discussion, so as not to hinder the current agreement. Marshall said that Bevin's suggestion still needed to be studied, and he said that the most urgent task at present is to draft the peace treaty, adding that the U.S. representative hopes that a proper German government will exist before the peace conference is convened, but the peace conference and the German government issue must not be mutually dependent. In short, when the German peace conference is held, a representative of the German government or a responsible representative assembly should be allowed to express their opinions. Bidault believes that the issue of the German central government should be discussed when discussing Germany's future political status, and that before the peace conditions are established in Germany and it can be guaranteed that Germany will respect democratic principles, the current Allied Control Council should not be disbanded.</p>
<h3>French Government Halts Strike Wave; Decides to Take Stern Measures; Parliament Discusses Empowerment Bill All Night</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 30th Broadcast: Paris, the French National Assembly held a session all night yesterday, and as of noon today, the meeting was still in progress. The main topic of discussion was how to eliminate the strike wave and protect workers who do not participate in the strike. Communist Party members spoke out and fiercely criticized the Schumann cabinet, causing the meeting to be interrupted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Prime Minister Schumann submitted a bill to ban strikes at a special meeting of the National Assembly this morning. Schumann loudly declared that if the strikes continued until December 1, they would dig a grave for the French currency. The bill grants the government special powers to deal with the labor situation, including increasing sanctions against saboteurs, ensuring freedom to work, strengthening the protection of the Republic's system, and increasing national police force, etc. The struggle between the Communist Party and the Schumann government has clearly reached a final juncture.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Paris is tense, with fears that the Communist Party will occupy public buildings and cut off Paris's connection with the outside world through strikes. At the same time, according to reliable sources, over the past 24 hours, 180 people have been arrested on charges of sabotage and obstructing work. In Saint-Etienne, central France, protesters attempted to invade the city hall and police station. The police responded with tanks and tear gas.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The Parliament held a full-night session to discuss Prime Minister Schumann's request for special powers to deal with labor unrest and protect non-striking personnel. Communist Party members adopted obstructionist tactics, making it impossible for the bill to be voted on. The meeting has lasted for twenty hours so far, until 10 a.m. this morning, and has not yet adjourned. Interior Minister Moch declared that if the Communist Party continues to disrupt, the government will order it to do so. 1,500 railway workers in the Paris suburbs also held a full-night meeting and voted to take action "at an appropriate time." If a strike is implemented, it would be a major blow to the government. The number of striking workers has now reached two million.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between the Government and the General Confederation of Labor Have Broken Down</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The French government, led by Prime Minister Schumann, took stern measures yesterday, while there was also much criticism in the National Assembly, which was clearly beyond the expectations of the Communist leaders in the General Confederation of Labor. Their negotiations with Labor Minister Mayer on conditions for calling off the strike continued until dawn on Sunday, ending at 4:55 a.m., without reaching a compromise. General Confederation of Labor leader Frachon said: "We are not satisfied, we have done our best, but all our demands have been rejected. We intend to turn the results to our comrades."</p>
<h3>Thorez Returns to Paris</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 30th Broadcast: Paris, as the political situation in France becomes increasingly serious, French Communist Party leader Thorez has returned from Moscow. Thorez visited the Soviet Union in his capacity as Secretary-General of the French Communist Party and stayed in Moscow for twenty days.</p>
<h3>France Rejects Soviet Protest Against Expulsion of Soviet Nationals</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] The French Foreign Ministry sent a note to the Soviet ambassador on the 29th, ignoring the Soviet Union's protest against the recent expulsion of nineteen Russians from France, stating that this action was an exercise of sovereignty.</p>
<h3>International Socialist Conference; Laski Warns the U.S. and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Antwerp, 29th] The International Socialist Conference severely criticized the Greek government on the 29th for refusing to issue passports to Greek Socialist Party members so that they could attend the conference. The conference discussed the issue of peace and economic reconstruction on the afternoon of the 29th. In a speech on the evening of the 28th, British delegation member Laski warned Marshall that any aid to Europe should not be subject to any political conditions. He also warned Molotov that peace must be built on the basis of democracy and freedom, otherwise it cannot be accepted.</p>
<h3>Countries Receiving U.S. Aid Should Reduce Currency Value</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, Associated Press] Representative Wolcott, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, today suggested that countries receiving U.S. aid must reduce the value of their currency against the U.S. dollar in accordance with the "actual basis". The committee may be ordered to handle any legislation relating to official companies organizing and handling foreign aid plans. He believes that the United States has not paid attention to the impact of foreign currencies on the U.S. domestic economy. He said that most of the ills of the domestic economy are caused by the inflation of foreign currency values. The inflation of foreign currency values promotes the export of various countries to the United States and forces Americans to make up for the difference between the "true value" and the statutory value of the currency.</p>
<h3>Pridi Broadcasts to the People; Free Thai Army to Take Action</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 29th] Former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong, broadcast to the Siamese people from the Singapore radio station on the night of the 27th, urging the Siamese people to maintain stability and avoid violence. He also defended the political status of the Free Siamese State, saying: "I hope that our goal of restoring the sacred constitution of the Siamese people's freedom of choice will be achieved by peaceful means within a reasonable period of time."</p>
<p>This coup group explains that Pridi's broadcast is a propaganda campaign aimed at preventing the world from attaching importance to the new Siamese government. Most observers believe that Pridi's broadcast is an order to the Free Siamese members across the country. Since Pridi left the country, it has been rumored throughout Siam that the Free Siamese State is ready to attack the military control forces withdrawing from Siam, especially in the northeast of Siam. According to today's report, the military authorities have learned that the Free Siamese Army will launch a large-scale operation tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Representatives Conference Discusses Austrian Peace Treaty; Report May Not Be Completed as Scheduled</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] The four foreign ministers' representatives discussing the Austrian issue held their third meeting at 10:30 this morning and are still in the explanatory stage. Only two days remain before Tuesday, the deadline for submitting their report to the Foreign Ministers Conference. The British, American, and Soviet representatives have not yet indicated whether they can accept France's compromise proposal on German assets in Austria. So far, only French representative Seydoux has clarified how much property of the Austrian oil industry will actually be transferred to the Soviet Union under the French compromise plan, and how much compensation Austria should pay to the Soviet Union for the property that cannot actually be transferred. Soviet representative Kozyrev has raised some supplementary factual questions, but has not stated whether he accepts the French proposal. Observers still express doubts about whether the representatives will be able to submit a unanimous report on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>West German Export Plan Can Achieve Self-Sufficiency Within Three Years</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Military District in Germany, told Reuters that he expects trade between Western Europe and Western Germany to revive within three years, enabling the U.S.-British zone of Germany to achieve a basis for self-sufficiency. The target for the 1948 German export plan is 500 million yuan. Most of the current excess imports are food expenses, which amount to 400 million yuan per year.

<h3>Implementation of Emergency Measures to Suppress Rebellion: Strict Control of Finance and Materials, Chiang Ching-kuo Likely to Head New Agency; Fundamental Solutions Submitted to Chairman for Approval</h3>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, and Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao recently received orders from the Chairman, instructing them to formulate effective measures and thoroughly implement them to stabilize the financial situation, curb prices, and improve people's livelihoods. Following the order, Xuan and others invited several economic experts for detailed research and have drafted both temporary and fundamental solutions. According to Central News Agency reporters, the temporary solution, named "Emergency Measures to Suppress Economic Rebellion," has been granted full authority by the Chairman and was implemented on November 28th, with intensified implementation starting December 1st.</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command, the Municipal Government, and the Central Bank, the three agencies jointly implementing the "Emergency Measures to Suppress Economic Rebellion," are adopting a division of labor and cooperation approach. A general executive agency will be established in the coming days, and its head will be a senior official appointed by the central government, with Chiang Ching-kuo as a likely candidate. It is reported that Chiang has been ordered to come to Shanghai within a day or two.</p>
<p>The first step of the "Emergency Measures" is to tighten the money supply. National banks will stop lending and overdrafts, and the same restrictions will be extended to current accounts at other banks, minimizing the liquidity of the legal tender. Remittances to Shanghai from other areas will be rejected, especially from the north and Hong Kong. It is expected that the tight money situation in the city will be unprecedented, and prices will continue to fall. Speculators who stir up trouble will inevitably suffer the consequences, and banks specializing in speculation will likely go bankrupt. The Central Bank, which had previously tried to support them, will now "show no mercy."</p>
<p>The second step concerns the control of materials. A "radical" approach has been devised, whereby all essential materials for people's livelihoods will be strictly controlled, with most of them being controlled by the government, no longer allowing them to become commodities for unscrupulous merchants to hoard and profit from. The materials currently hoarded by unscrupulous merchants will be subject to a general inventory of warehouses throughout the city by the Garrison Command, with the mobilization of military police. Materials suspected of being hoarded will be sealed, and then the government will sell them to the citizens of the city at a fair price, while merchants suspected of hoarding will be dealt with by military law for violating the General Mobilization Law.</p>
<p>The measures stipulated in these two steps were taken to Nanjing by Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao, who requested instructions from Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. Governor Zhang is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 1st, and it is expected that the measures can be implemented in the near future.</p>
<p>Regarding the fundamental solutions, Xuan Tie-wu, Wu Guozhen, and Zhang Jia'ao jointly drafted them and submitted them to the Chairman in Nanjing for approval. It is reported that the content is roughly to implement a rationing system for daily necessities to thoroughly solve the people's livelihood problems.</p>
<h3>Steel-Coated Paper Wastes Foreign Exchange; Tinfoil Industry Calls for Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Shanghai Tinfoil Industry Association held an emergency appeal to newspaper reporters last night, stating that the imported steel-coated paper used for cigarettes is flooding the market, affecting the industry's survival. The association urged all Chinese cigarette factories to adhere to the principles of patriotism and frugality and to use domestically produced tinfoil as much as possible to maintain the national industry. According to Gao Wenliang, the chairman of the association, cigarette tinfoil was originally supplied by domestic tinfoil manufacturers, but it has been replaced by imported steel-coated paper since its import. After the victory, the government was well aware that steel-coated paper is a luxury item, so it did not provide foreign exchange for its import, but smuggled goods still flowed into Shanghai. Furthermore, the Swiss-owned China Aluminum Steel Products Factory in Shanghai, which originally manufactured steel products needed by Chinese people as its main business, has also recently switched to producing steel-coated paper in large quantities, putting the domestic tinfoil industry in a precarious situation. Tinfoil is superior to steel-coated paper in terms of moisture and mildew resistance, except for its lack of gloss. It is also cheaper than steel-coated paper on the black market. However, cigarette factories compete for vanity and would rather abandon cheap tinfoil and use steel-coated paper instead. According to statistics for the eight months of this year, the cost has been close to 800 billion. Assuming a USD exchange rate of 50,000, this is equivalent to USD 16 million, which could buy 1,600 airplanes, 16,000 cars, or 40,000 tons of merchant ships. If we do not use steel-coated paper, national defense construction could be completed after one year, establishing a strong country. The industry now requests: Cigarette factories should wake up and use domestic products, which will not only protect the tinfoil industry and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers but also save a large amount of foreign exchange and strengthen national defense construction. Please ask the government to restrict the large-scale production of the China Aluminum Steel Products Factory, and the total sales should not exceed 20% of the market demand. Request the government to allocate raw materials such as blue aluminum and Yunnan tin to directly reduce production costs and indirectly reduce the burden on consumers.</p>

<h3>Chairman Fang's Resignation Not Approved; Central Government Grants Special Leave for Recuperation; Gui Chongji Resigns as Candidate for National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Department returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after a week in Nanjing. When talking to reporters about his mission to Nanjing and his impressions of the general election, he said: I have been working in Shanghai for more than a year, and I have exhausted my mind and body. Fortunately, the general election is about to be completed, and the party groups have also achieved unity. I went to Nanjing specifically to resign from my current position, hoping to unload my burden. Although my resignation has not been approved, the central government has granted me short leave to rest. The National Assembly elections in various provinces and cities have gone very well. The democratic competition style in Shanghai is particularly praised by the central government. It is hoped that there will be even better performance in the election of legislators in the future, adding glory to Shanghai. As for my election as a representative of the National Assembly in Shanghai, it is entirely the result of the support and care of people from all walks of life and fellow villagers.

<p>[Our News] Xi Mulin, the owner of a tofu shop at No. 389 Anqing Road, had two large gold bars hidden in a rice jar on the third floor, covered with lime.

<h3>Spirit Food for Children: Serial Picture Books Remain Popular</h3>
<p>[Our News Special Feature] In Shanghai, any road has at least two serial picture book stalls, and they have ten times more readers than any library every day.</p>
<p>The compilation and drawing of serial picture books are different from ordinary books. Drafting, drawing, scenery, descriptions, supervising the drawing, and publishing are all different jobs. A small booklet of only 140 pages is like filming a 　movie　, requiring the cooperation of more than 　ten　 people to complete. Especially the drawing, which is the core work of serial picture 　books　. Among the eighty-odd illustrators in Shanghai, Shen Manyun and Chen Guangyi's humorous paintings and animal 　pictures　, Yan Shaotang and Zhao Hongben's historical paintings, and Jiang Ping and Li Tiesheng's fashion paintings are the most familiar and admired by children and adult readers of serial picture books. Their every stroke creates countless beautiful fantasies for the children.</p>
<p>A Young Lady Studies Art With A Tutor</p>
<p>Drawing work is the life of serial picture books, so the ranking of practitioners is extremely 　strict　. Those who draw characters are the top tier, those who draw landscapes are second-class, those who draw houses are lower-class, and the lowest class is those who draw window frames and fill in the floor, limited to filling in patterns and lines. Now that the serial picture book industry has developed, several veteran artists have taken on the character of artists, being lazy and producing very little. On the one hand, they also close their doors to recruit apprentices, and those who admire them and ask to join their ranks come in droves. Recently, a young lady is also preparing to study art under Zhang Shaodai, who is now considered the leading figure in the field. "Bi Ruhua," the "serial exhaustive" writer most admired by children, is his disciple. Each time they create, the teacher first conceives the plot, and then assigns the students to draw characters, scenery, and descriptions, dividing the work in order, each performing their own tasks, and then combining them into a complete page.</p>
<p>Eagerly Reading, Paper Becomes As Valuable As In Luoyang</p>
<p>Although "Investiture of the Gods" and "Journey to the West" have been banned, the adapted versions of "Mei Taigong" and "Xuanzang's Trip Abroad" are still among the best-selling books in serial picture books. Three thousand copies per edition have been published three times in the past few months. As for the most popular character recently, it is "Tarzan." Whether "Tarzan" is in danger, saving his son, or suppressing bandits, as long as there is a picture of that invincible and fearless idol, children will rush to read it, and paper becomes as valuable as in Luoyang. The era of spitting out white light and taking people's heads from thousands of miles away is over, but what has replaced it is still a superhuman depiction. According to a parent of an average family, "Little Rascal" comes back from school, his eyebrows furrowed and his arms raised high, yelling and looking for objects to be conquered, which must be after reading something like "Tarzan Pacifies the Barbarians" at the book stall at the school gate. Sometimes "Little Rascal" hides behind the door, pretending to hold a pistol with his fingers, waiting for someone to arrive and suddenly appearing, which must be a review after reading "The Thief Lupin" or "Sherlock Holmes." According to his detailed investigation of the child afterward, it proved to be perfectly accurate.</p>
<p>Striving for Improvement but Suffering Losses</p>
<p>Why do publishers continue to compile and print these almost meaningless serial picture books? According to several publishing booksellers who strive for improvement regardless of sales: Xiyin Bookstore has published "Wen Tianxiang," "The Childhood of the National Father," "The Great Man Roosevelt," and "National Martyr Yan Yingyuan," Meihua Bookstore has published "Ma Zhanshan," "Xianglin Sao," and "The Nanjing Massacre," and Wenhua Bookstore has published "Eight Years of the War of Resistance" and "Teacher of Ten Thousand Generations," and so on, all of which have attempted to break through the shackles of myths and monsters with advanced and novel ideas, but the results have been failures, with dismal sales and unbearable losses. The reason is that young friends do not like this type of book!</p>
<p>Mythical Scripts Are Easier To Approve</p>
<p>Also, when the Social Affairs Bureau reviews the content, mythical and bizarre scripts are easier to pass than biographies and histories. This has a great impact on the psychology of publishers. Biographies require textual research, and the review time is inevitably longer. It is said that Meihua Painting Bureau wanted to publish a book called "Commander Liao" last year, which described Liao Yaoxiang's experience in the War of Resistance. At the beginning of the compilation, it was well-documented and thoroughly researched, but it was only recently approved, with the submission taking more than a year. It is said that many details were carefully considered and revised, which took the most time. For example, in the original manuscript, the soldiers saluted with their left hand, and the review ordered them to change to their right hand. In the draft of Liao Yaoxiang's escape, he was missing a military cap and wearing ragged clothes. The author's intention was to show the circumstances of his hasty breakout, but the Social Affairs Bureau considered that as a soldier, he should be rigorous and orderly even in the face of danger, and his clothes should be neat. Such a picture was simply close to humiliation, so they ordered a fresh start and redrawing. It cost several times the time it took to create mythical drawings.</p>
<p>40% Sold Overseas</p>
<p>Shanghai now has eighty bookstores specializing in publishing serial picture books. From the beginning of last year to the end of August this year, including historical, scientific, ethical, romance, martial arts, humorous, detective, and other categories, a total of more than 1,200 types have been published. It still maintains a production volume of two books per day. If it is summer, children will read them to keep cool, and sales will improve, and production can be increased to four books per day. Ten percent of these illustrated books are sold to Southeast Asia, and 30% are sold to Taiwan. It is said that the overseas Chinese are forcing their children to read them, so that they can savor the real situation of their motherland from the vivid and detailed pictures.</p>
<p>In the noisy and clamorous city, have you ever noticed those children clustered next to the serial picture book stalls in the alleys, using their saved snack money to seek their own luxurious imaginations?</p>

<h3>Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office Discusses Amnesty for Crimes</h3>
<p>Rather Than Releasing Them to Return to Prison, It Is Better to Transfer Them to the Frontier for Reclamation</p>
<p>[Exclusive Interview with Our News] The reporter recently visited Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, and asked him about the following three matters: In the amnesty decree issued in this city on New Year's Day, traitors were not granted grace. Recently, it has been reported that some people in the capital have suggested that the government issue another decree on New Year's Day next year, so that traitors can also have the opportunity to be pardoned. It is also said that when 　constitutional　 government is implemented in the future, there will be another amnesty to show a new beginning with the people. Has the chief prosecutor heard of this? The case of Zhang Shankun and others from China Film Corporation, who were attached to the enemy, has been under investigation at the High Prosecutor's Office for a long time. I wonder what the results are? Also, Yue Feng, Li Lihua, and others are also under investigation, but their new film "Three Women" has been released. What is the chief prosecutor's opinion on this? More than a hundred former joint guarantors are accused of colluding with the enemy, involving many famous people in the city. What will the High Prosecutor's Office do about this? Du avoided giving a direct answer to the first question, saying that the matter of amnesty is of great importance and must be decided after the President is elected in the future. However, regarding the amnesty on New Year's Day this year, there is room for discussion. The purpose of the government's promulgation of the amnesty is to give criminals the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, turn the useless into the useful, and participate in social production. If we evaluate the amnesty on New Year's Day this year in this way, it is clear that it has failed to achieve this goal. Most of those who were pardoned were thieves. After being released from prison, they wandered the streets, and their food, clothing, and shelter became problems. No one in society helped them, so they had to find their "old buddies" and resume their "theft" career to solve their food and clothing problems. Therefore, almost all of them returned to prison soon after their release. It is recalled that in the South City Court, twelve juvenile thieves released in the morning were sent to the court again in the afternoon for theft. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve the effect of clarifying society without fundamentally solving the problem. He believes that the fundamental solution is to "settle the frontier" for homeless criminals, transplanting them to sparsely populated areas, such as Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the northwest, and desert islands in the sea, so that they can reclaim the land. On the one hand, it can isolate the bad elements from the whole society, and on the other hand, it can strengthen the border areas, encourage them to reclaim wasteland and produce, and turn the useless into the useful. European and American countries often transport criminals by ship to deserted islands for reclamation, which is the same idea. He said that he had contributed this opinion to the judicial authorities, but it was probably not adopted due to the turmoil in the country and the tight financial situation. He hopes that the public will promote it so that it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Li Lihua and Others Filming Still Shows No Signs of Illegality</h3>
<p>Mr. Du, regarding the second question, stated that the case concerning film personnel collaborating with the enemy has not been concluded to this day. The High Prosecutor's Office is also extremely anxious and has repeatedly sent letters to relevant agencies for investigation. However, replies have not been received, hindering the progress of the investigation. Furthermore, the case involves dozens of people, including Zhang Shankun of the puppet China Film Company, and must be resolved as a whole. Due to the incomplete investigation of several individuals, the entire case has been shelved. This is the reason for the delay in the case. As for Yue Feng, Li Lihua, and others, during the investigation period, it cannot be determined that they have committed crimes of communicating with the enemy, and their filming still shows no signs of illegality. Mr. Du, regarding the third question, stated that the case involving over a hundred puppet Lianbao chiefs is also a single case. It must be resolved simultaneously. The investigation focuses on whether these Lianbao chiefs colluded with the enemy during the period of occupation and engaged in conduct detrimental to the people. If there is clear evidence of their crimes, they will be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Authorities are Intensifying the Investigation of Official-Business Collusion and Embezzlement Case. The Earliest Informant was Lu Genji Construction Company. Yi Feng Firm handled the import of over one hundred billion yuan.</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper News" As of yesterday, most of the perpetrators involved in the major official-business collusion and embezzlement case have been detained by the garrison headquarters. Among them, in addition to Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Xiehui, and Zhang Yuan, who were assistants in the Import Permit Inspection and Valuation Section of the Jianghai Customs, there are also more than ten responsible persons and key employees from four import and export firms. Some of them are detained in the former detention center for traitors in the Nanshi area, while others are still in the Third Inspection Brigade. All are prohibited from seeing family members. Although yesterday was Sunday, Li Xicheng, the section chief of the Ministry of National Defense who was ordered to come to Shanghai for investigation, continued to supervise the above-mentioned relevant agencies to intensify the secret interrogation. According to information obtained by our reporter, the earliest informant in this case was Lu Genji Construction Company. However, the points they accused were not as "significant" as those discovered after the current thorough investigation. In particular, there are many people involved in the import and export firms related to this case. Taking Yi Feng Firm at No. 413, Citibank Building, Jiujiang Road, as an example, the value of imported materials handled through embezzlement and deceptive practices has reached over one hundred billion yuan. Therefore, after the manager of the firm, Mao Fengxiang, was arrested on the evening of the 24th, many important employees of the firm were also detained the next day. From Mao's confession, three import and export customs declaration firms were also implicated. These three firms are still under investigation, so it is not convenient to disclose the names of the companies and the names of the arrested persons. As for the involvement of individuals with military status, relevant personnel did not confirm this yesterday, or it may be a warehouse official of a certain unit.</p>
<h3>Jumped from Building Due to Grief Over Mother's Death. How Can This Be Said to Be a Test?</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper News" At 9:15 yesterday morning, at the Xiaocaichang, a triangular area on Minhang Road, Hongkou, just as the market was opening, a man suddenly jumped from the second floor of the vegetable market in an attempt to commit suicide. He was helped up by people and sent to Gongji Hospital. It is said that his name is Gu Shengbao, 47 years old, residing at No. 2481 Yangshupu Road, and it was caused by grief over his mother's death.</p>
<h3>Carrying Zhang Shi's "Handwritten Order" to Scare and Extort the Bathhouse Owner. Impersonating a Police Officer Led to Capture</h3>
<p>"Our Newspaper News" Sun Baofa, nicknamed "Little Wuxi," operates Anlechi Bathhouse at No. 35 Yunnan South Road. He used to have an opium addiction but has quit. Unexpectedly, in the middle of last month, three men claiming to be plainclothes police officers, carrying a handwritten order from Zhang Shi, the deputy director of the police station, went to Sun's residence at No. 4 Yongye Lane, Baxianqiao, firmly insisting that Sun was still addicted to drugs and wanted to take him to the station for detention and interrogation. After Sun repeatedly stated that he had quit and asked for help, the three men left. They came again on the morning of the 27th. Because Sun was out on business, his wife received them. Negotiations began, demanding several "notes" (meaning bribes) to settle the case. His wife was anxious and helpless, so she called her husband's friend, Lu Yongxing, for help. Lu is an employee of Anshang Inn on Yunnan South Road and is quite familiar with the personnel of the police station. He rushed to Sun's house and greeted the visitors. One claimed to be Zheng Ziliang, the section chief of the detective division, and another claimed to be detective Wang Lin. Lu, knowing that there were no such personnel in the detective division of the police station, immediately called a friend in the detective division of the general bureau to inquire. It was immediately confirmed that there was no such case and no such person. The division immediately sent personnel to Sun's house to arrest the three men who were impersonating police officers. After interrogation, they confessed: "We originally served in the police force, but we were dismissed this spring due to a case. In extreme poverty, we resorted to this behavior of borrowing a name to swindle and deceive." Deputy Director Zhang believes that since the criminals dared to forge his handwritten order to defraud people, if they are not severely punished, how can we warn others? He has ordered his subordinates to handle the case strictly according to the law.</p>

<h3>Kicking to Death Case. Portuguese Police Not Guilty? Lotus Mountain Bandit Ship Disguised as Inspection Boat Attempted to Attack Wuxue Ship, Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 30th Dispatch] The third session of the first Guangdong Provincial Assembly is scheduled to open on the 1st, and the main topics for discussion will be public security and official governance. Song Ziwen will attend to report on provincial affairs.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Newspaper Association previously sent Liang Feng and others to Beijing to appeal to the government to increase the allocation of paper. Liang and others have now returned to Guangzhou on the 29th. The results of this trip are extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>According to unofficial sources: The Guangzhou Headquarters, in order to accelerate the suppression of banditry on land and water in Guangdong Province, has specifically scheduled a Guangdong Provincial Water and Land Transportation Pacification Conference to be held on the 3rd of next month. In addition, the Guangzhou Headquarters has formally ordered the Navy's 6th Artillery Unit to fully suppress the Huashan bandits who endanger the water transportation routes between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and has set a deadline of half a month for their elimination. Also, the Wuxue ship traveling between Hong Kong and Guangdong was attacked by a bandit ship disguised as a customs inspection boat on the Lianhua Mountain river surface yesterday. Fortunately, the customs anti-smuggling ship happened to pass by at this time, and the bandit ship fled in panic upon hearing the news.</p>

<h3>General Election in Hong Kong. Staging Strange Dramas Such as "Elephants Crossing the River"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hong Kong 26th Dispatch] The news of the first nationwide general election on the 21st was overshadowed by the wedding news of British Princess Elizabeth in Hong Kong, which was listed as a difficult election area! Public opinion in Hong Kong and China on the holding of the general election in the mainland only made general reviews based on the situation in the mainland. Everyone kept silent about the temporary loss of precious voting rights by millions of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, as if there was something unsaid. Before the Hong Kong government officially expressed its attitude and prohibited overseas Chinese from holding elections in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong District Election Affairs Office set up in the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce had attracted widespread attention. In the past, many giants in the Hong Kong and Chinese business circles were interested in the National Assembly representatives. The election of the chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce a month ago had sparked the most intense competition in history for this reason. Two leaders of the Hong Kong and Chinese women's circles had publicly expressed their participation in the National Assembly election and attacked each other. One accused the other of "elephants crossing the river" because she came from Guangzhou, and the other accused the other of being protected by the puppet government because some of the directors of a girls' middle school she ran were puppet figures. And some figures who traveled between Hong Kong and Guangdong, the "good shows" they painstakingly created could not be staged in time. How sad they must be these days to see the news of other places announcing the results of the election in the newspapers! (Special Correspondent Zijiang)</p>

<h3>Shengde Opens Well: Tede Loses to Great China: Siqiu Zhonglian Beats Great China, First League Match Kicks Off</h3>
<p>The third football league finally kicked off yesterday. Donghua first met Tede, and Kang team played against Jewish team. The strength of the two opening matches was quite different, so they were one-sided.

<p>Donghua Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Referee Li Guoyi, kicked off in the center circle. Cao Qinfang from Tede led the crowd to attack, but to no avail. After ten minutes of melee, Wang Nanzhen broke through the key pass and cut from the left corner. The landing point was excellent, but Cao Qinfang was one step late and was saved by Bang Lun. After a brief surprise for Donghua, they tried their best to besiege. At 28 minutes, Li Jinde received a Longhai pass, and shot from 18 yards away from the goal and broke the net, leading with 1:0. Donghua succeeded and their momentum increased. Yin Zhe rose directly on the edge, and Chen Xiaoping saved it not far away. Yu Qia and Ji Timely arrived and knocked on the door from 25 yards away. Xu Fusheng's sight was obscured and there was no way to save it. At the end of the first half, Donghua led by 2:0.</p>
<p>Two More in the Second Half</p>
<p>After the break, the two teams rejoined. Tede reorganized their lineup and made every effort to counterattack. Xu Ming and Cao Laosan rode north together, but were blocked by Xin Fuzhen. Qian Changrong responded in the middle and tried to invade again. For a while, Tede looked quite active. At 10 minutes, Tang Genfu made a small pass to the center, and Cao Qinfang shot back powerfully. The ball was quite steep, and Zhang Banglun blocked it into a corner kick, and the storm subsided. At 15 minutes, Li Jin became restless and went deep into Tede's hinterland alone. He crossed the ball in one kick, but Longhai's header was too high and failed. At 34 minutes, Sun Jinshun passed the ball with his feet, Longhai rushed fiercely, Zhang Rongguang was careless, and lost the goal. Donghua scored 3:0. One minute before the end of the match, Li Jin shot powerfully through the net in the crowd again. When the golden bell rang, Donghua defeated Tede with a score of 4:0.</p>

<h3>Authorities Plan to Implement Full Control: Set Prices for Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Will Start with Centralized Purchase and Allocation of Cotton from Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the change of the head of the Textile Council, there is a determination to change the previously stalled joint distribution pilot program for cotton yarn to a full control of cotton yarn and cloth. The general idea is to ensure the cost of reproduction for each manufacturer, hoping that all manufacturers related to cotton yarn and cloth can embody the government's aim of stabilizing prices, sacrificing personal interests, and making cotton yarn and cloth reach a stable situation.</p>
<p>It is heard that this comprehensive control policy will start from the centralized purchase of cotton, the centralized allocation of raw cotton, to the centralized purchase and sale of yarn and cloth. It will be implemented simultaneously in the major cotton yarn and cloth centers across the country, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, etc., to seek thorough implementation and unified government orders. General observations indicate that the recent fluctuations in prices have been primarily influenced by cotton yarn and cloth. If the price of cotton yarn and cloth can be stabilized comprehensively, it will be of great help to the overall price stability policy.</p>
<p>However, according to related parties' speculations, private yarn factories in this area already have many opinions on the implementation of the joint distribution pilot program. Once a full control of yarn and cloth is implemented, there may be concerns that it will be difficult to operate. However, for the sake of the overall price policy, this comprehensive control policy is necessary to be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<h3>If Rayon Re-Sales Resume This Week: Suspended Quotas Can Still Be Supplemented: And Will Be Calculated at 80% of Market Price in Principle</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Central Trust Bureau's rayon was previously consulted by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau regarding the distribution situation. The bureau has sent all relevant files regarding past distribution to the Social Affairs Bureau for reference. Before the new distribution method of the Social Affairs Bureau is decided, sales will be temporarily suspended. The suspension has lasted for three weeks. According to the person in charge of the bureau to the reporter, whether the bureau's rayon will resume sales this week will depend on whether the distribution method set by the Social Affairs Bureau has been approved and sent to the bureau. If it is received, it will be distributed immediately in accordance with the method. The amount of the previous three weeks of suspended distribution can still be supplemented in full. The distribution price will still be calculated based on 80% of the average weekly market price in principle. The 4,500 boxes of rayon shipped from Japan have arrived in Shanghai and were stored in the warehouse three days ago.</p>
<h3>Authorities Suppress Prices: Will Continue to Tighten Credit: Rumors of Issuing 50,000 Yuan Notes Are Absolutely Groundless</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the relevant authorities in this city, the Central Bank's recent efforts to suppress prices and strictly tighten credit have achieved considerable results. Some speculative merchants deliberately spread rumors that the National Bank's tightening of credit this time is a prelude to the upcoming issuance of 50,000 yuan notes, in order to disturb people's minds. In fact, the authorities have taken this measure with the great determination to suppress prices, and the facts will prove that the above rumors are absolutely groundless. If these speculative merchants continue to stir up trouble and do not restrain themselves, they will surely suffer the consequences.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Market is Looking Good</h3>
<p>In the asphalt market, the demand for candle-making supplies in Zhuhai Fang is relatively strong, and the market is looking good. He Ben oil has risen to 2.67 million yuan per dan, and Ping oil, Lan oil, and other prices have also risen to around 2.45 million yuan, about 10% better than before. However, new goods have already entered the market, and production areas are currently collecting and refining them for sales in Shanghai. The market is expected to be stable.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Registration of Industry and Commerce: Deadline Set for the End of This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau has set the deadline for the general supplementary registration of industry and commerce in this city after the victory to the end of this year, excluding newly established ones. The bureau hopes that factories, companies, and firms in this city that have not yet completed supplementary registration will go through the registration procedures as soon as possible. Extensions will not be granted after the deadline, and penalties will be imposed in accordance with the industrial and commercial registration laws.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was very weak in the face of tightening credit. Many vendors were eager to sell, and asking prices went from firm to weak. Although some dealers bought at low prices, it was heard that returned goods were arriving, and each case of 10-piece Old Knife cigarettes fell by 40 to the port. British cigarettes were even, and the rest of the Chinese merchants' cigarettes were trading well, with ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Mining Construction Association: Organizes Taiwan Inspection Group</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In view of the solid foundation of industry and mining in Taiwan, the China Industrial and Mining Construction Association has launched the organization of a Taiwan Industrial and Mining Inspection Group to serve as a mirror for military inspection. The group is led by Lei Zhen, director of the association, and Pu Xinya as the deputy head. The members include Li Lixia, Wang Zhuyi, Li Zai, Fan Heyan, Shen Rixin, Gu Zhuhong, Zhang Shulin, Wang Zhenhai, Jiang Dingwu, Lu Rongguang, Wang Boheng, Chen Baohua, Hu Guoliang, Liu Nianyi, Chen Jingmin, Tang Xiongjun, Liao Yunshi, and other 32 people, all of whom are leaders in the financial, industrial, and commercial circles. Director Lei of the group has already contacted Chairman Wei of the Taiwan Province by letter and telegram, and plans to depart in early this month to visit various important industries in Taiwan, staying for about a week.</p>
<p>The China Industrial and Mining Construction Association aims to connect people from the financial, technical, and business sectors to promote China's industrial and mining undertakings. Most of China's general industrial and mining groups are specialized organizations, and the establishment of this association has great value and significance. Therefore, when the association was established in Chongqing on February 2, 1944, more than 500 people participated. It has successively founded a technical service agency and a joint factory and mine office, and has devoted itself to various movements to promote industrial and mining construction. It has greatly benefited the encouragement and support of the rear industrial and mining industries during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory and restoration, due to the dispersal of directors, supervisors, and members in various places, the association's affairs were slightly suspended. Now, Chairman Chen of the association, Lei Zhen, Xu Enhui, Cai Shuhou, Wu Yourong, and others have agreed to actively resume the association's activities, intending to register old members, solicit new members, convene the Second Congress of Members, and plan to set up the head office in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Government Attempts to Encourage Export of Materials</h3>
<p>Recently, due to high costs, the export of tung oil, pig bristles, tea, cotton textiles, and other export commodities has been mostly stagnant and impossible to export. The central authorities have taken note of this and ordered the Export Control Committee to find ways to improve the situation and assist exporters in earning foreign exchange. The committee recently convened a meeting of export leaders to exchange views. They felt distressed because of the fluctuations in the black market exchange rate. Although the current exchange rate has been adjusted, it is still far from being sufficient. The Export Control Committee authorities promised to assist in seeking to restore the export of various materials.</p>
<p>In addition, the authorities decided to export a large amount of yarn and cloth, and cotton textiles through the textile export committee mechanism. According to the person in charge of the association, the association recently decided to export various finished products such as 1,120 bales of cotton yarn. In addition, there are 30,000 bales of cotton with self-prepared foreign exchange without a license. After entrusting various yarn factories to spin yarn and cloth, they will handle the export.</p>
<p>Another report: The Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association recently convened a meeting of the standing directors to discuss the topic of opening up the difficult situation in light of the rampant black market exchange rate and rising prices, which have caused the export business to fall into a stagnant and sluggish state. At that time, Ye Xuyu, the standing director of the association, was publicly recommended to prepare opinions and detailed plans for reforming and promoting the export business, and will submit them to the relevant authorities as a reference for policy implementation.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Both Decline: Kerosene and Candles Are Relatively Good</h3>
<p>The soap market among daily necessities is sluggish due to tight capital among its peers. Traders are watching and waiting, and scattered sales are not uncommon. Fixed price Gu Ben soap, Huang Xiangmao, Niu Pai, and other soaps have also dropped by about 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Matches: Meili Phoenix, Pingding, and new brand goods have fallen by 50,000 to 120,000.</p>
<p>Kerosene supply cannot meet demand. Mobil and Asia have risen to 470,000 per can. Candles have risen by 30,000 per box due to increased costs.</p>

<h3>On "Melancholy Sensuality"</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>When the suicide case of Xiao Danggui was publicly tried, the audience was surprisingly packed, "the courthouse square was filled" (see Shen Bao, November 28th), and some people even "broke into" the solemn courtroom to see Zhang Chunfan, resulting in their arrest. On the surface, this is just a manifestation of Shanghai people's love for novelty and excitement; but, looking at it deeply and remotely, it is really a bit chilling.</p>
<p>Xiao Danggui's mood before and after her suicide is not difficult to imagine. She didn't read much, was content with her lot, and even if she suffered all kinds of embarrassing torments, she would at most cry and die, and did not seek legal relief through a lawyer. But, why did a fairly popular celebrity die so easily? In my opinion, the plots of the plays she starred in are a major reason.</p>
<p>Try flipping through the Yue Opera advertisements. Almost every play is a tragedy, and the most used promotional phrases on the advertisements are "melancholy sensuality" and "always poignant." A while ago, there was also the use of the famous phrase "bitterness is the result of bitterness." It seems that as long as a play can make the audience cry like a spring, it is a great success. Xiao Danggui starred in Leng Shan's "The Flower of Wrath" is one example. I haven't seen this play, but it can be seen from Zhang Chunfan's few words of confession. He said that the content of the play is "about a concubine being seduced and committing suicide as a result." On the one hand, Xiao Danggui inevitably had some feeling of being in the same boat as the heroine of this play, and on the other hand, the heroine's way out in this play certainly had a subliminal effect. The plot of this play is toxic, and what really instigated Xiao Danggui's suicide was precisely the toxin of this play!</p>
<p>Xiao Danggui's death unfortunately strengthened the power of this toxin. Many theaters are already staging plays with her suicide as the theme every day. Of course, the advertisements are again full of words such as "melancholy sensuality." This toxin is expanding and penetrating deeper into the hearts of many housewives and female students who may not read much. The power of "suggestion" is so deep, and in this era of chaos and famine, "stimulation" is never in short supply. The combination of accumulated "suggestion" and "stimulation" may have unimaginable results.</p>
<p>Drama is the most direct form of propaganda, and the prosperity of a country's national fortune is most clearly reflected in its drama. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, what is needed today is a grand spirit and a pioneering spirit; we really have no reason to tolerate things like "melancholy sensuality" anymore!</p>
<h3>Paper Talk</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>What is paper?</p>
<p>Of course, I, I can easily answer: this is what this article is printed on, what you used to write a letter yesterday, and what the newspaper vendor sends to your house every morning.</p>
<p>But, not long ago, someone went to Appleton in Washington to see a strange house. After three years of cold and heat, the house still stood unscathed despite the rain and sun. However, that house was made entirely of paper - the roof, the walls, the floor, everything was paper.</p>
<p>A grain merchant in the Midwest of the United States also had his own special experience. Once, a storm destroyed the roof of his warehouse, and hundreds of bags of grain were stored inside paper bags. A rainstorm soaked all the uncovered things. But was the grain spoiled? Not at all, no water damage.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that paper curtains are already on sale. The master of a house was sitting reading his evening newspaper, and the phone rang. He put his cigarette in the ashtray to answer the phone. A gust of wind blew the paper curtain onto the ashtray. But there was only a scorch mark on the curtain, and no other household disaster occurred.</p>
<p>Paper has undergone more than one revolution in its historical process. First, it made the spread of writing possible; second, it provided a wrapping material without which modern department stores could not exist. Today it is creating a third revolution, the result of which will completely change our past concept of paper.</p>
<p>Paper scientists declare that the days are not far off when we will wear paper clothes, eat from paper bowls, walk on paper carpets, sleep on paper sheets, and live in paper houses.</p>
<p>Some of these new paper products have already appeared on the market and will greatly reduce your financial burden, because the manufacturing process of paper is the simplest of all manufacturing processes, so the cost is also low.</p>
<p>But how can you turn paper into what you want? This is precisely the secret to the paper scientists' paper revolution. You just need to understand certain chemicals, and your paper immediately becomes more than ordinary paper.</p>
<p>There is a moisture-resistant paper that already has many uses, such as wiping car windows, and the paper used by the U.S. Navy during the war to wipe optical instruments. There is also a super-strong paper towel that is stronger than ordinary towels. Even more rare is a paper that is non-greasy and can be washed with soap and water.</p>
<p>There are also paper bibs for children. This stuff is absorbent and cheap, and can be thrown away after one use. Paper aprons for housewives are soft, washable, and non-flammable.</p>
<p>Fireproof paper is also a great miracle of modern industry. Many of the gun covers used by the U.S. military during the war used this fireproof paper.</p>
<p>But the most noteworthy is paper cloth, which may revolutionize clothing. In the near future, there will be a paper cloth shirt. Because it is cheap, you may throw it away after wearing it once. Paper raincoats will soon replace glass raincoats, and paper galoshes will rival rubber galoshes.</p>
<p>Do you hate flies? Wallpaper treated with DDT can solve this problem for you.</p>
<p>Paper has contributed to human civilization for thousands of years, but now it is starting a new revolution and will become a powerful rival in the world of polymers, textiles, and light metals.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from the Mouse Lair</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>The Stone Artifacts of Tan’s Tomb and Su Shun</p>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic, the translation group of the Examination Yuan dreamed and the government ordered a state funeral. At the time, the person who designed the mausoleum's architecture considered that since the site was near the sacred resting place of the National Father (Sun Yat-sen), it would not be able to surpass it in height or grandeur. Therefore, they sought to establish a unique style through gentle and subtle shifts in the terrain, hence the tomb's particularly rich garden-like atmosphere.</p>
<p>The design of this tomb has an abundance of tranquility but lacks sufficient loftiness and solemnity, reflecting the magnanimity of the Prime Minister. However, the stone artifacts in front of the tomb, from the ornamental columns to the kneeling figures and upturned bowls, are almost all exquisite pieces. Upon first seeing them, one was surprised by the exceptional craftsmanship and discerning eye. Later, it was learned that they were moved from the tomb of Su Shun in Changping. Some say they were purchased from Su Shun's descendants for two thousand gold pieces; others say they were given by the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Committee without any payment. Many years have passed, and it is impossible to determine which account is true. However, adorning Tan's tomb with the relics of Su Shun, if Chaling (Tan Yankai) knew beneath the earth, he would undoubtedly be perplexed and lament.</p>
<p>Regarding the re-evaluation of historical figures, focusing on the late Qing Dynasty, Su Shun deserves primary re-evaluation. I believe this man had brains and shoulders; his fault lay in his arrogance, underestimating his peers in the court, which led to their collective attack and his inability to escape political encirclement. If the Empress Dowagers of the East and West had not abandoned the late Emperor Xianfeng's edict and entrusted him with affairs of state, although it is impossible to know the changes in Gui Lai’s schemes, the political landscape would have been different. At the very least, it would have been possible to curtail the rise of the Western Empress Dowager's power, which would have objectively benefited the overall situation of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Wang Xiangyi, widely known to have been favored by Su Shun, wrote in his diary in the seventh month of the tenth year of Tongzhi about the desolate state of Su Shun's former residence in Erlongkeng, expressing deep sorrow. He sent a letter to Su Shun's second son to discuss the matter, but the latter declined to come, citing the lack of proper attire. Xiangyi was moved to lament, saying, "The bannermen still cling to their habits of ostentation... There is no way to help them recover." Only ten years after Su Shun was executed, his descendants had become so impoverished. Therefore, it is not impossible that they would sell their ancestor's tomb artifacts for two thousand gold pieces twenty years after the Republic.</p>
<p>Weng Changshu's diary also contains many records of Su Shun, referring to him as "Lord Su." His record of the palace examination in the thirteenth year of Xianfeng includes the phrase "Lord Su gave orders with his eyes and gestures, treating scholars like slaves." This man had extraordinary talent but lacked sufficient scholarship. His unbridled arrogance undoubtedly caused resentment among his peers, and the seeds of his downfall were already sown.</p>
<h3>Ten Years a Slave Girl</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper, I learned that Xiao Dan Gui, who recently committed suicide by swallowing Lysol, was a "popular" "Red Actress" of the "De Du class". Now, reading the reports in various newspapers about the preliminary trial of Zhang Chunfan, I suddenly realized that the so-called "Red Actress" was actually a female slave. Why call her a female slave? This can be understood simply by looking at Zhang Chunfan's testimony. He said, "(I) and Xiao are from the same village and have known each other for ten years. I bought her in X County."</p>
<p>Xiao Dan Gui's tragedy did not begin today; it can be said to have "long been in the making," because Xiao Dan Gui was truly a "dead soul," and Zhang Chunfan, who had "known her for ten years," had indeed been living a Gogol-esque dream for ten years. Now, due to Xiao's suicide, Zhang Chunfan has finally awakened. Upon awakening, he finds himself in court, facing legal accusations, moral condemnation, and emotional suffering, which is entirely "deserved"!</p>
<p>One witness made a very interesting statement, saying that Xiao Dan Gui's suicide was due to a "change of heart." According to his speculation, Xiao Dan Gui wanted to be nice to Leng Shan, but she didn't dare, leaving her with only suicide as an option. Under the severe and coarse oppression of the Gogol-esque Zhang Chunfan, it is obviously questionable whether Xiao Dan Gui could have developed love for him. I even question whether she understood love or experienced love. Coincidentally, a third party, the married Leng Shan, entered the picture, which was "just the right time." He gave her intellectual nourishment, artistic cultivation, and a taste of life. Their various social activities, such as watching plays, taking walks, chatting, and corresponding, gradually became commonplace. Zhang Chunfan angrily said, "You think this is ordinary, but I think it is extraordinary!" Xiao Dan Gui, influenced by feudal toxins, vacillated, struggling between old and new ideas and emotions, seemingly unable to find knowledge, unable to find art, unable to find love, unable to find life, unable to find a way out, only vaguely feeling that "it's hard to be a person," "it's hard to be a good person," and therefore "died."</p>
<p>Female slaves like Xiao Dan Gui, who spend ten years or a lifetime in a dream, are not uncommon. However, those who take a step forward after awakening and refuse to bow their heads and retreat or raise their heads and advance further are truly rare, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3>Lament of the Banished Immortal</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>The other day, I watched the film "Lament of the Banished Immortal." In it, one of the female characters (playing Lawrence) described the musician Louis with a phrase, saying that he was "a little off the earth," seemingly of the eccentric kind. Someone has defined "poetry" as follows: poetry is the diary of an aquatic animal that has left the water to live on land and yet wants to fly in the sky. This speaks of poets.</p>
<p>However, the body ultimately cannot leave the Earth, so Maupassant said: "We only need to think a little to know that this world is very unsuitable for animals like us. Thought makes those of us who have knowledge forever miserable exiles on Earth" (or refugees; this term seems to imply the meaning of a god being banished to Earth).</p>
<p>Although humans today claim to have thousands of years of history, in the developmental history of the entire universe, today's so-called humans are still just a kind of animal lingering between "human" and "beast." "Human face and beast heart" and "dressed in clothes, but beasts" must be the adjectives for this kind of animal. Of course, this is said from the human standpoint; otherwise, it is quite debatable whether a human face is necessarily more elegant than a beast face, or whether clothing is necessarily more convenient than fur. However, due to some kind of "transgressive evolution," a small number of a certain type of animal that exists between "god" and "human" may occasionally be found among humans; they wander between the heavens and the mundane world—although born on Earth, they do not belong to Earth. In history, we can sometimes see people of this type. These people are born too peacefully and too early, several thousand years too early; it is probably not very easy to succeed in this world. Confucius and Jesus belong to this group, as do Socrates, Galileo, Copernicus, Martin Luther... Look at the fate these people suffered! They are fish out of water, very uncoordinated in the human world; if they still want to fly off the ground, then they will inevitably be regarded as absurd monsters and shot at by social elites. People today often say that "the world's customs are not as ancient as they used to be," and they inevitably grumble in their hearts about those who are so-called "ancient ways are worthy of admiration," meaning that the era of that "ancient way" has passed. In this era, where one has to fight even one's own shadow, the unsuitability of such people is real, but it is not necessarily true that the era of that ancient way has passed; human hearts and minds may not have been more ancient than pigs. The "ancient age" we imagine has probably not yet arrived. Hugo said: In today's world, the Kingdom of Heaven has not yet been moved to Earth.</p>
<p>In general, the deeper one is in the human world, the farther one is from the Kingdom of Heaven. Children, before their knowledge opens up, are a kind of angel between "god" and "human." Although the Kingdom of Heaven is not outside, they still vacillate between "heaven" and "earth." There is a saying in the Bible: "The road to the Kingdom of Heaven is straight, but narrow." I think only children who have not lost their childishness have hope of reaching there. Great people's bodies appear too... However, children will eventually become adults. From this, one can imagine that the population of the Kingdom of Heaven must be sparse.</p>
<h3>Unfettered Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter One: Happy to Find a Soulmate (1)</p>
<p>For people in the Pear Garden world (Chinese Opera), the most precious thing is a good voice. If you have a good voice and work hard, everything will be smooth. If you don't have a good voice, it's called "having no capital" in the business. Without capital, no matter how innovative you are, you will always be inferior in art. Therefore, those who are particular about singing pay attention to their voices with all their spirit. Beiping (Beijing) is the birthplace of famous actors of the Jingchao (Beijing Opera) school. Whether you are an old performer or a beginner apprentice, if you want a clear and bright voice, you must warm up your voice every day. Those living in Beiping often climb to a high building at dawn and listen carefully. Sharps and long cries can be heard in the air. Those who don't know may think it's the whistling of pig herders, but insiders can tell that it's the sound of warming up voices. These people who warm up their voices in the morning mostly choose places with open spaces, such as Tiananmen Square, Zhongshan Park, and the Temple of Heaven in Beiping, which are convenient locations with fresh air. Warming up one's voice by the water, by the corner of a wall, on a hillside, or under a tree, and singing a few lines, will not only improve one's voice day by day, but also greatly benefit one's body by humming and singing in the clear morning air. Therefore, tourists in the Temple of Heaven and Zhongshan Park often hear very pleasant and melodious singing in the morning. Most old Beiping people are accustomed to it and are not very interested in these warm-ups and scattered sounds. When tourists newly arrived from the South hear these sounds, they can't help but be surprised, searching for the source of the sound to see who is warming up their voice and singing.</p>
<p>This day was already after the Frost's Descent solar term. The climate in Beiping is different from that in the South. As soon as the autumn message arrives, it is the west wind rolling, and yellow leaves flying. Although Zhongshan Park is full of autumn colors, on the earth mountain west of the waterside pavilion, among the verdant cypress trees, there was a young man in his twenties, wearing a straight Western suit, walking back and forth on the narrow mountain path, concentrating on imitating the Mei style’s Yutangchun. Before he could finish singing a passage, there was a rustling sound in the mountain path. A girl of twelve or thirteen years old, followed by a sweet and pretty young lady, emerged from among the trees, staring at the young man. The girl's bright eyes looked at the young man a few times, then leaned close to the young lady's ear, seemingly whispering something. The young man felt disturbed by their presence, interrupting his artistic enjoyment. He stopped warming up his voice and slowly walked down the mountain path. Passing through a small pavilion, he vaguely saw a woman hiding behind the mountain rocks, temporarily ignoring her. He hurried to the Moon Gate on the back river, practiced his voice for a while under a row of persimmon trees, facing the corner of the vermilion wall, and sang the unfinished passage of Yutangchun again. Just as he finished singing the passage, he suddenly heard applause behind him, thinking that someone was disturbing him again. Turning around, frowning, he saw that it was his uncle-in-law, Lu Xiaobo, hurriedly walking over. Xiaobo smiled and said, "Shuwei, you've been singing even better lately!" Shuwei hurriedly smiled and said, "I'm just singing randomly. Uncle-in-law, if you see anything wrong, please give me some guidance." Before Xiaobo could answer, a young girl walked out of the woods across from them and shouted to Xiaobo, "Boss Xiao! Why are you out so early today?" Xiaobo said, "I've been suffering from insomnia lately, and my appetite isn't good. The doctor advised me to come out for a walk. I went home from the park yesterday and haven't slept since!"</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Land Leasing When Landlords Reclaim Land for Self-Cultivation and Tenants Refuse to Vacate</h3>
<p>Yang of Songjiang: My friend Zhang owns more than ten acres of land, which he leased to others for cultivation and entered into a contract. Now my friend wants to reclaim the land for self-cultivation, but the tenant refuses to return the land, and the two parties are almost involved in litigation. I have several legal questions and would appreciate it if your lawyer could provide answers. Thank you very much. The lease states "The land cannot be leased to others except when the owner reclaims it for self-cultivation" and "The rent in rice can be required from the tenant when returning the land." Based on the above two points, can the tenancy be revoked and the tenant be required to return the land? The tenant has not paid rent for many years before the war. This contract was signed after the war. Can he refuse to vacate? Some say that old tenants do not pay the rent for the year when they leave. The new contract was signed in 1945. Can we deny that he is an old tenant? Is the tenant refusing to vacate an act of coercion, given that there was a notice to vacate beforehand? Does the tenant have the right to prevent it? How should we respond if he refuses to vacate?</p>
<p>"Lawyer Duanben answers:" If it is an indefinite lease of cultivated land, the landlord can reclaim it for self-cultivation according to Article 114 of the Land Law, and it is also legal to request rent payment. Not acceptable. Not acceptable. This kind of... cannot be applied. Therefore, there is no! deny that he is an old tenant. Since there was an agreement beforehand, there must be no behavior contrary to the contract. No right to prevent it. File a lawsuit to confirm that the lease is terminated according to law.</p>

<h3>Frequency Modulation</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In today's era of rapid advances in wireless electricity, we are all keenly aware of the great distress caused by receiver distortion and atmospheric static. Often, when we listen to the radio, we hear sounds that do not resemble the original music, or we hear jarring, cacophonous noises that make our ears ring and make us feel uncomfortable. We know that the origin of these problems does not lie in the receiver or the transmitter, but is a major shortcoming of the currently prevalent amplitude modulation (AM) system, and is also an obstacle to the current broadcasting industry. Because people want to remedy the above shortcomings, frequency modulation (FM) was invented.</p>
<p>In an AM transmitter, a high-frequency current is generated by an oscillator and a low-frequency signal. This low-frequency signal changes with the strength of the sound. We use this low-frequency current to vary the screen voltage in the modulator vacuum tube, thus changing the amplitude of the output current of this vacuum tube. After working at a large scale, it is transmitted on the antenna. But these works have a problem; this is when the amplitude-modulated wave encounters static electricity in the air. Since the amplitude of static electricity is similar to that of the amplitude-modulated wave, the two waves mix and enter the receiver at the same time, and the detector stage in the receiver cannot completely remove it, allowing it to freely enter the loudspeaker through the amplifier tube, and thus the rasping, jarring noise is produced.</p>
<p>This phenomenon does not occur in FM systems, because FM systems use the different strengths of sound to vary the frequency of the radio waves transmitted into the air within a certain limit. The extent of this change is the sidebands in the AM system. If a carrier wave is amplitude-modulated by sound, it becomes three parts, one of which is the original frequency, one is higher than the original frequency, and one is lower than the original frequency. As for the numerical value, it depends on the frequency of the amplitude modulation. The FM frequency uses all three parts, but keeps the wave amplitude constant. Common FM oscillating circuits use the Hartley type, which uses the low-frequency radio waves in the microphone to change the grid voltage of the reactance tube, and then outputs it from the screen of this tube and enters the grid of the oscillating tube, so that the frequency in the oscillating tube changes indirectly by the low-frequency radio waves in the microphone. In this way, after frequency doubling and amplification, this kind of constant-amplitude wave can be output from the antenna. On the receiver side, FM receivers add a limiter stage and a frequency detection stage, also called a discriminator, in addition to ordinary receivers. Because the amplitude of the received wave may vary, the amplitude of its precursor waves through the limiting stage is very stable, and then it goes through the frequency detection stage or amplifies the echo. In the above work, static electricity, although it enters the antenna, cannot pass through the limiting stage, because extremely high and low amplitudes cannot pass, and even if they can pass, they are negligible. In this way, there will be no jarring, cacophonous sounds in the receiver's loudspeaker.</p>
<p>The advantages of FM are not only that it can avoid interference from static electricity, but also the following:</p>
<p>First, in terms of power and range, we all hope to minimize the power of the transmitter as much as possible, so that savings can be achieved and the range can be doubled. The FM system can meet our ideals. For example, an FM transmitter can have a range hundreds of times greater than an AM transmitter of the same power.</p>
<p>Second, two or more FM radio stations can use the same frequency and broadcast simultaneously. If they are spaced apart appropriately, the receiver will not be affected. But this is not the case with AM radio stations. The receiver often receives signals from two radio stations, confusing them. However, FM requires a large frequency width, so it is suitable for high frequency bands, such as the 88 to 108 MHz band, where more than 4,000 FM radio stations can be set up.</p>
<p>Third, AM systems change the range of their required amplitude, and these radio waves cannot suit the various components of the original music and perfectly transmit them. Therefore, there is a phenomenon of distortion. FM radio waves change with the width of the frequency. In low-frequency music, both the pitch and timbre can be transmitted by this frequency change without losing any of this beautiful music. When we listen, it feels like we are hearing it directly.</p>
<p>Fourth, in AM systems, the variation of amplitude causes each vacuum tube to change its characteristics according to the power size. In FM systems, because the wave amplitude is constant, the vacuum tubes can maximize their working efficiency to the point of perfection. The FM system was invented by Professor Armstrong of the United States as early as ten years ago. At the time, when he advocated replacing the AM system with the FM system, it was of course not valued by people. Later, after his unremitting efforts, he finally succeeded. That year was 1935. His first FM transmitter was built, with a power of 2 million watts. At that time, he used more than seventy vacuum tubes, and the frequency was 44 MHz. Today, the number of vacuum tubes used in FM transmitters has gradually been reduced to twenty, and the power is only 50,000 watts. In the near future, the current AM system can often be replaced.</p>
<h3>Fluorine</h3>
<p>— Hong En</p>
<p>The "Bad Guy" of the Elements</p>
<p>Halogens are a stubborn family. As chemists say, they are powerful and unpredictable. Like the famous "members" chlorine and bromine, they were only tamed a short time ago, and now their fierce nature has turned into a useful element.</p>
<p>Centuries ago, chemists were thinking about how to make chlorine work, but this element is extremely dangerous. Once it encounters hydrogen, it turns into hydrofluoric acid—scientifically one of the most destructive reactions.</p>
<p>Now, after years of arduous experimentation, science has transformed this troublemaker into a useful citizen, a major component in insecticides, plastics, and refrigerating liquids. Fluorine can also be used to make brilliant dyes, protect oils (preventing them from oxidizing), and in high voltage, make a gas almost a perfect insulator—an excellent bactericide, improved fumigation and disinfection, a solvent, a fire-resistant substance, and rosin. Fluorine: in these past few years, it has transformed from a devil to an angel. This colorless gas, heavier than air and irritating, ranks twentieth in abundance among the elements.</p>
<p>From 1670 to 1886, the brightest chemical minds were in a race to isolate pure fluorine, until an obscure French chemist, Henri Moissan, solved the problem in 1886 by using electrolysis to isolate fluorine.</p>
<p>Now, after many erroneous experiments, a practical method has finally been found to produce elemental fluorine on a large scale. A specially designed electrolytic cell containing potassium fluoride and oxygen fluoride is used, with the temperature maintained at around 100 degrees Celsius. During electrolysis, hydrogen and chlorine gases are produced. The special design prevents fluorine and hydrogen from combining, as such a combination would cause a large explosion, potentially destroying the fluorine equipment.</p>
<p>Researchers attempted to store the electrolytically produced fluorine in a suitable container for sale, but steel and copper were found to be corroded by fluorine under normal pressure, making container preparation impossible. Only after detailed research was it proven that a type of gasket (made of rubber, etc.) could both not react with fluorine and prevent any fluorine leakage after packaging. When sold, it is only a small amount of fluorine, packaged in cylinders—about one and a half pounds of fluorine under four hundred pounds of pressure.</p>
<p>This pure fluorine has strange properties. Its atoms are very sociable, rushing to find chemical friends. Because of their haste, they often destroy other stable substances. For example, fluorine reacts with silicon to form a gas, and fluorine also absorbs hydrogen extremely easily, even more readily than air.</p>
<p>When a cylinder of fluorine gas is released, whether it touches glass, asbestos, or rock, it always turns into a cloud of smoke. They are all mixtures of silicon, so they react very easily with fluorine. If fluorine is sprayed on water, it will drive away the air and combine with hydrogen, thus emitting a strong, thick smoke. In the same way, hot steel and wooden strips will also emit smoke.</p>
<p>Because chlorine has the above cunning temperament, it is limited to the needs of laboratories and the application of technicians.</p>
<p>Now that pure fluorine is the latest product, large amounts of fluorides are also being put to work. Fluor spar is the main fluorine mineral. It is a beautiful crystalline mineral, often subtly displaying an elegant color, but it is not known that it hides the evil fluorine inside. The most fluor spar is produced in the United States in places such as Illinois, Now Monico, Kontrclky, etc. If six to eight pounds of fluor spar are added to a ton of steel, it is easier to dissolve the steel in the open hearth process, saving fuel, and the steel produced is of a superior quality.</p>
<p>In the manufacture of enamels, a large amount of fluor spar is also needed every year, because fluor spar can lower the melting point of the elements in the enamel and increase the brilliance of the finished product. When fluor spar is added to glass, it becomes milky white and is used to make light bulbs, lampshades, and so on.</p>
<p>Also, when fluor spar reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid, a gas with a strange odor is produced. If absorbed by water, it becomes concentrated hydrofluoric acid. In the past, this liquid was specifically used for etching glassware and as a reagent for industrial analysis. In the past few years, after it gradually disappeared, hydrofluoric acid also became peculiar. At that time, after intense research, a complex mixture called Freons was produced. Among them, the most successful gas is commonly called Fr2, which is a perfect refrigerant. The development of this economical refrigerant has surpassed indoor refrigerators.</p>
<p>Other commercial fluorine minerals include cryolite, which contains a mixture of aluminum (sodium aluminum fluoride). It is also an electrolyte for the manufacture of aluminum. Greenland is the place with the most cryolite production. Because of its importance, special escorts were often used during the war to transport it from Greenland to the United States.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to see the future of fluorine. Scientists studying materials science say it is bright. For example, it is predicted that a fluorine mixture can be used to make smooth oil that can withstand the most rugged modern machinery for a long time (which is now impossible without a lubricant that can withstand terrible pressure and friction). Like an occasional event, today's hydrochloric acid can be refined into high-grade gasoline in oil refineries. Oxides added to water can prevent tooth decay.</p>
<p>Fluorine will be modified into a gas that is an absolute insulator under amazingly high voltage and applied to neck-generation X-rays and other electronic work. Fluorine also has a new chemical tool: metal fluoroborates. Among them, sodium fluoroborate can be applied to trees to prevent insect attacks and used as a cleaning agent to remove rust from iron or clean the surfaces of stones and earth, exterminating bedbugs and mice. Potassium fluoroborate is used as a flux for welding metals.</p>
<p>Other fluorine-related products include heat conductors, excellent insecticides, super anesthetics, herbicide objects, insulating rubber, fire-resistant substances, plastics, fumigants, etc.</p>

<h3>BCG—Tuberculosis Prevention Vaccine</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>BCG is the abbreviation of Bacillus Guerin in English. The direct translation should be the tuberculosis prevention vaccine discovered by Calmette and Guerin. This name commemorates the two French scientists Calmette (GuA Calmette) and Guerin (CGuerin) forty years ago.</p>
<p>Calmette and Guerin initially thought that pulmonary tuberculosis was rampant among cattle. If a part of the germs could be taken from sick cattle and gradually weakened, so that its toxicity was reduced, to the point that it would not cause tuberculosis after being injected into the human body, then this germ might stimulate the human body to produce a strong immune body, like the effects of preventing diphtheria and smallpox.</p>
<p>This ideal was correct. After a long period of work, they put a highly virulent germ separated from cattle into a potato culture dish containing 5% glycerin and bovine bile. After four years of such work, they had achieved preliminary success. The cultured bacteria no longer caused tuberculosis in animals. Then, after thirteen years of research, the BCG vaccine was officially created.</p>
<p>After successfully testing the reaction of BCG on chimpanzees, Calmette, disregarding criticism from all sides, gave a small amount of BCG to infants who had just been born and lived with a grandmother suffering from tuberculosis. The infants grew up healthy, at least proving its partial effectiveness.</p>
<p>After continuous experimentation by scientists, among more than two million infants who have used the BCG vaccine, we know that although it cannot absolutely prevent tuberculosis, the vast majority of people have been able to avoid tuberculosis. Even if they unfortunately still contract tuberculosis, the situation is relatively mild and easier to treat. Unfortunately, it can only prevent tuberculosis and cannot be used for treatment. It cannot be used for people who have already had tuberculosis. In fact, adults are rarely not infected, so the target of application is often infants.</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai Pasteur Institute (institut Pasteur) is studying BCG under the guidance of Dr. Liu Yongchun, which is good news for my country's medical community!</p>
<h3>Sketches of the British National Physical Laboratory</h3>
<p>— Chen Feng</p>
<p>The British National Physical Laboratory, founded forty-six years ago, is a world-renowned scientific research institute. It belongs to the Science and Industrial Research Department and is located in Teddington, a suburb of London, covering an area of more than sixty acres. Leading this laboratory is the world's leading theoretical physicist Sir Dr. Charles Darwin; he is the eldest grandson of the great biologist Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>This famous laboratory is the link between scientific knowledge and daily life, the medium between theory and experiment, and the bridge between science and industry and commerce.</p>
<p>This institute is divided into ten departments: the Physics Department, the Engineering Department, the Electrical Department, the Wireless Electricity Department, the Measurement Department, the Metallurgy Department, the Optics Department, the Aeronautics Department, the Naval Architecture Department, and the Mathematics Department. The scope is so wide that it can be said to be all-encompassing.</p>
<p>The premise of the development of modern industry is the progress of weights and measures. Determining the standards of these countless units of measurement is definitely not something that private enterprises can accomplish. This is one of the important tasks of the laboratory. The Measurement Department preserves the standard units of length, mass, and time, as well as their derived units, such as volume, density, and pressure, etc. The measurement of length can be accurate to one millionth of an inch. The Electrical Department has a small group specializing in how to preserve the standards of current, voltage, and resistance, etc. in the CGS system. At the same time, there are also standards for units in wireless electricity, such as the comparison of frequencies, which can distinguish differences of one ten millionth. The Acoustics Group of the Physics Department studies how to measure noise, and there is also a Radiology Group responsible for the British Radium Standard. Before 1939, one-fourth of the world's radium was tested here.</p>
<p>In addition to the preservation of standards, the determination of the characteristics of various industrial raw materials is also an important task. For example, the Engineering Department studies the "fatigue" of materials and the "creep" of metals. The latter is the phenomenon of overflow that occurs when metals are subjected to various forces at high temperatures. This laboratory is a pioneer in this kind of research. There is also the Metallurgy Department, which studies the physical properties of metals and alloys, such as strength, composition, and structure, etc.</p>
<p>Most of the departments here are broad and general, but there are also two specialized departments—the Naval Architecture Department and the Wireless Electricity Department. The Naval Architecture Department studies how to improve ship design and the improvement of propulsion, and also makes models to test the properties of ships. Before the war, 80% of merchant ships were first tested with models here before being built. It is estimated that this can save one million tons of fuel every year. The Mulberry Harbour used during the Great Occupation in France was also planned and decided here. As for the work of the Wireless Electricity Department, it is to study the propagation, attenuation, direction finding, and the properties of air and the ionsphere of wireless electricity. The success of radar used in the war was mostly due to the research work of this department.</p>
<p>The British National Physical Laboratory is still growing continuously. On the one hand, the work of each department is gradually developing and expanding. On the other hand, new departments are added when needed. The Mathematics Department is a newly added one. Its tasks can be divided into three points: one is calculation work. If there is an engineering problem, the equations are already available, but large-scale calculations are needed before the curve can be determined and applied, then it can be entrusted to this department to do it; the second is statistical work; and the third is the improvement and design of computers.</p>
<p>This institute is a very large organization, and a detailed description cannot be achieved in a short article. Departments such as the Aeronautics Department and the Optics Department also have important work, which this article has not introduced. In short, it is still one of the largest research institutes in the world. The world recognizes its value and its authority, and it can develop scientific talents in all aspects. The industrial community will consult it more and obtain valuable guidance.</p>
<h3>Prospects for Bacterial Warfare</h3>
<p>— Qu Youding</p>
<p>The term bacterial warfare may already be familiar to people. This is a tactic whose horror is comparable to that of atomic warfare. In bacterial warfare, of course, the main thing is to use the invasion and spread of bacteria to kill the enemy, but the bacteria used are quite limited due to various reasons; now let's talk about several kinds of bacteria that are suitable for bacterial warfare.</p>
<p>The cholera bacteria, tetanus bacteria, typhoid bacteria, and smallpox, etc. that humans fear the most are first listed as unsuitable for bacterial warfare, mainly because they can be prevented by injection of preventive needles. Some are excluded because they are not infectious, easy to diagnose and treat, or cannot be spread by artificial methods. Only twenty-one kinds of pathogenic bacteria are expected to be used in war.</p>
<p>In the past, under the topic of biological warfare, there was mention of a canned food poison bacteria called Botulism, which is extremely toxic to the human stomach. If 350 pounds of this substance are dripped into 10 million gallons of reservoir, drinking one drop of this water will kill people—according to Dr. Roseburg and Kabat, this thing may be used in war. However, after many frequent experiments on white mice, it was discovered that white mice can drink one percent of the amount of water that would kill a person and still not die. Over time, it is even predicted that drinkers can use the simplest method of boiling and disinfecting to drink it without harm. In fact, the bacteria that can be used in war are almost all some strange and little-known bacteria. According to reports, parrot fever, which was once rampant in Africa in 1930, is one type. Others include a disease called Meliodosis, the "Far East Disease." According to reliable medical records, only ninety-five people had suffered from this disease until 1933. These toxins or bacilli can only be obtained from biological laboratories and will be beneficial for military purposes, because the more bizarre the symptoms, the more difficult the treatment, and this kind of infectious disease can harm the enemy.</p>
<p>More familiar and usable for general combat are Anthrax, flu bacteria, meningitis, and pneumonic plague, etc. Pneumonic plague has the name of a "super" weapon. A single pneumonic plague bacillus is enough to kill a squad rat. As for humans, they should also be unable to escape. This bacterium can spread in dense smoke and fog, not only in open spaces, but can even enter through closed windows and doors.</p>
<p>As for the method of throwing bacteria, it still needs to be studied. There is a method that is completely feasible and beneficial for military use, that is, using aircraft to throw tightly closed bacterial boxes. Once they land, they can automatically unfold and hug out large groups of insects (such as mosquitoes and flies) carrying millions of bacteria, using their entire thorn to transmit the disease. If a certain bacillus can resist explosions, using debris, missiles, grenades, etc., can also carry bacteria and complete its infectious mission. Usually, it not only poisons humans, but also poisons the meat, milk, food, and industrial products supplied by animals. These are of course also the general goals of bacterial warfare.</p>
<h3>Small Inventions</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Electronic Wall-Penetrating Peep Sight The American General Electric Co. recently invented a microwave device that can peep through walls with unusual clarity. This peep sight looks like a spotlight, controlled by 110 volts of alternating current. It includes many electron tubes, oscillating circuits, transformers, antennas, and reflectors, all contained in a box weighing only four pounds. The wall-penetrating peep sight emits a concentrated high-frequency radio wave, so it can penetrate obstacles such as brick walls and reflect back from rough or dark surfaces. A metal tube then carries the reflected light back to the clock. At the same time, the antenna in the parabolic reflector senses these reflected lights, and after passing through a silica detector, the results are indicated on an instrument. The electronic wall-penetrating peep sight has great industrial uses, such as counting, orientation, switching, erasing, signaling, quotas, and projection, etc.</p>
<p>New Method for Preserving Frozen Meat Frozen fish and frozen meat can be dipped in molten plastic wax, which can save many unreliable packaging methods. This is the latest method for preserving cold food in the United States. The wax paste does not stick to the surface of the food, but can adhere to it tightly, making it more firm and safe than the best oil paper at low temperatures. It does not fall off when dropped casually, and frozen meat can be used for more than a year. When you eat it, cut open the food and scrape it with a knife, and the wax will come off completely. Therefore, fruits and vegetables can also be preserved using this method.</p>
