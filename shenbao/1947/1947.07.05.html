<h3>總動員案全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕國民政府委員會四日國務會議中，通過主席交議如期實現憲政，貫澈和平建國方針案一件，茲探誌原案如次：</p>
<p>為拯救匪區人民，保障民族生存，輩固國家統一，提請勵行全國總動員，以戡平共匪叛亂，掃除民主障碍，如期實施憲政，貫澈和平建國方針案。</p>
<p>政府自抗戰勝利後，即積極進行復員，以期從事建設與民蘇息，雖一切措施，未能盡如所期，但對於中國共產黨擁兵割據，擾害地方，武力叛國之行動，則始終秉持政治解決之方針，不惜委曲求全，多方容忍，以求其實現。乃共黨自去年十月以來，始則拒絕政府頒布之停戰令，繼則拒絕參加國民大會又復拒絕政府派員赴延安商洽和平之建議，最近復由其宣傳機關對國民參政會之和平建議斷然予以拒絕，政府方力謀整軍，而共黨則脅制民衆，大量擴充其叛國之武力。政府方力謀復員建設，而共匪則到處阻碍復員之進行，到處破壞我交通工礦之建設。政府方勵圖實現民主政治，準備行憲工作，而共匪則一面宣傳民主，一面殘虐人民，無所不用其極。最近數月，共匪復在華北，東北對我國軍發動大規模之攻勢，妨碍政府對領土主權之完全接收，其必欲以武力　覆國家，已極囅著，而其煽動各地社會，擾亂治安秩序之盜匪暴行，亦日益明顯。共匪旣公然揭開其武裝全面之叛亂，實已自絕於國人，且早以武裝叛亂集團自居，而自外於政黨之林，不惜與國家民族為敵，其怙惡不悛，執迷不悟，一至於此，則政府和平建國之國策，已非以政治方式所能求得解決。尤其我北方受共匪蹂躪區域及接近匪區之同胞，水深火熱，日甚一日，政府不能長此貽誤，坐視不救，而我全國同胞欲求得安居樂業之生活，亦非以全力剷除此復興建國之最大障碍，實不足以捍衛國家基礎，與全體人民之安全。況政府有鞏固國家統一，保障民族生存之責任，若非從速戡平叛亂，則不僅憲政與民主無由實現，即國家之統一與安全亦已失其保障，故政府之決心戡戰，實出於萬不得已，必須全國軍民集中意志，動員全國力量，一面加緊戡亂，而積極建設，方能掃除民主憲政之障礙，達成和平建國之目的。本此意旨，擬請國務會議決定實行全國總動員，號召全民，一致奮起，淬厲進行，舉凡加強經濟建設，刷新地方政治，發動人力物力，改善糧政役政，保持社會安全，救恤人民疾苦，保障人民基本權利，厲行消費節約，增進農工生產，提高官兵待遇等項，均交各主管機關妥擬方案，制頒法令，一體依法推行，至實施時應如何防止法外之滋擾，並飭主管機關嚴切注意。</p>
<h3>國務會討論　有關選舉案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國務會議討論主席交議之「國大代表及立院立委選罷法之施行日期，是否即如選總所所請，俟各項附表公布齊全之日起算，抑應如何規定案「當時曾引起辯論。該案係據選　所呈，以國大立委選罷法施行條例及分配表等雖將陸續公布，尙有國大代表選罷法名額分配附表及立委職團名額分配表，均迄未公布，在此種附表公布齊全前，選務無法推進，選舉程序亦無從確定，勢須俟附表全部公在方能着手實施，而憲法實施準備程序規定期，為選舉法公布後六個月內完成，期限至為迫切。該所曾決議選舉法施行日期，擬俟附表公佈齊全之日起算。討論時有主張仍以選罷法及施行條例公布之日起算者，有主張照選總所之擬議者，討論甚久，最後決定交法制審查委會審查，再提大會討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕國民政府令：（一）茲制定國民大會職業團體代表名額分配表公布之，此令。（二）茲修正國民大會代表選舉罷免法第十二條條文公布之，此令。（三）茲修正立法院立法委員選舉罷免法第十二條條文公布之，此令。（四）茲制定僑居國外國民立法委員選舉區域之劃分及每區應出名額分配表公布之，此令。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕孫副主席四日談，國務會議所通過之「厲行全國總動員」案時稱，共黨發動全面叛亂，威脅國家生存，政府為謀通盤應付，乃根據總動員法，通過此一要案。此一決策與討伐令無大差異，所不同者，討伐令係專對共黨，而此一決策則在動員政府內部。此案通過後，將交政院擬定方案並制頒法令，予以實行。記者四日並訪政府及民靑兩黨人士，詢以對總動員案之意見。</p>
<p>文官長吳鼎昌稱：共黨擁兵割據，擾亂地方，為時已久，政府為令全國人民明瞭事實，應有所說明，動員工作將分交主管機關妥擬辦法，付諸實施。對剿共軍事，並非討伐之意，而在加強而已。</p>
<p>中委張繼稱，全國總　員之　案，實相當於討伐令，而加強剿共軍事。此　　　，可謂十年來僅有之一次。自抗戰以來，始於共同作戰，勝利後參加黨派協商，迨至去歲·中共放棄和平，擾害地方，政府在多方容忍之下，被迫應戰，迄今友敵不分，是以此案之通過，當能昭示我全國同胞判明是非，實屬必要。張氏認為如總動晨施行得宜，軍車加强，一年之內，可肅淸共軍。</p>
<p>白部長對記者詢問其對總動員之軍事部份如何進行，僅答稱，可往詢陳總長。國防部係執行機構，政府有命令自當奉行。在計劃方面，本部並無</p>
<p>關於　淸共軍時限，陳誠稱：「余非測字算命者，余不能預計其何時可以達成此目的」。</p>
<p>中委陳立夫稱：「吾人應集中一切人力，物力，加緊勘戡亂，積極建設·對於共軍，即以美國言，對不忠實於國家之份予，均有權予以整肅，何况共黨以武力割據，擾亂地方，破壞憲法，自應予以整肅。</p>
<p>政局澄淸以後　共軍投誠必多</p>
<p>一年來邊打邊談，究係打抑係和，國人甚難辯明。</p>
<p>對前方士氣影響尤大，而共軍士兵欲投誠者，復因懼於如和談成功，將受共黨危害而不敢來，故此項辦法公佈後，政局澄淸，共軍投誠者必多，兵敗如山倒。遙想若干時日後，共軍當可戡平，勝利可能於短期內獲得。唯吾人自亦不應過份輕視共黨」。</p>
<p>靑年黨陳啓天，對總動員案表示並無異議，渠表示贊同政府此項必要措施。民社黨蔣勻田稱：「此案旣經通過，將來施行務求能切實可行，吾人對此提案表示同意」。</p>
<p>滬各界人士重視　政府對時局決策</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日國務會議通過對時局之提案後，本市各界人士均極注意，惟以未見提案全文，不願多加評論。記者昨訪各界名流，探得對此措施之感想如下下：</p>
<p>參議會副議長徐寄廣表示：政府之所以不正式下令討伐，乃尊重友黨意見之故，惟事實上此舉與討伐無異。政府旣決心動員全國之人九，物力，以期縮短內亂，想國內之軍事衝突不致拖延過久。</p>
<p>全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初稱：政府之未下討伐令，為時局留一餘地。事實上，因已通過動員，討伐令自屬不必要。此舉對國際上，以姿態較緩和，亦有好影響。至於以一定之時閒，求內亂之蕩平，實為一困難之任務。當前之要圖，第一為如何安定人心。特別知識靑年，應使其有為國家社會服務之機會。目前有大學學生願至工廠求當工人，實為畸形之現象。當前之經濟情况應加以改善，惟有關因素太複雜，實行亦殊不易。</p>
<p>名律師陳霆銳表示：對中共下不下討伐令，實質上並無分別。動員實施後，有正名之作用，過去政府在政策上之衝突，今已完全消除，想可提高士氣而增加作戰力量。以此舉對國際上之影響而論，則國際上早已　壘分明，不必顯忌。今後政府當求其在我，上下厲行法治，以求政治之改革。</p>

<h3>立法院休會兩月　昨通過大婦女代表名額分配表　一六八名中滬佔其六</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立法院四日午後舉行三三二次例會，亦為休會前最後一次會議，五日起休會兩個月，至九月初始再開會。今日會議，由孫兼院長主席，出席立委六十餘人，通過案件如下：（一）國民大會婦女團體代表名額分配表案。（按：國大婦女代表共一六八名，滬市佔六名。）（二）修正復　後，辦理民事訴訟補充條例第廿六條條文案。（三）修正新聞局組織條例第七條，及第八條條文案。（四）修正省參議會組織條例第三條第三款案。（五）　勛委員會組織條例案。（六）修正中華民國駐聯合國代表辦事處組織條例案。（七）重行劃分甘肅省選舉區案。（八）修正福建省立法委員選舉區份之劃分，將原屬第二選舉區之壽寗縣劃歸第一選</p>
<p>最後并討論劉　訓等五十立委連署所提休會一個半月至兩個之臨時動議，決議自五日起休言，，至八月底止。會議至六時三刻許於全體黨聲中閉會，</p>
<h3>妨害選舉處罰條例草案　復會後再予審查　孫兼院長指出內容不够充實</h3>
<p>今日立院會議，首先討論國大婦女代表名額分配表，以該案三日曾加討論，會中無大辯論，唯一爭議者，僅為全國性婦女團體分會問題，結果仍維持原議，即全國性婦女團體，以在各省市有五個以上分會，其會員名册報社會部有案者為限。</p>
<p>另一與選舉有關之案件，為「妨害選舉處罰條例草案」，該案於三二九次例會中亦曾加以討論，當時以內容尙有値得研討之處，決議重付審查。</p>
<p>該案提出後，首由羅鼎予以說明，繼即開始辯論。司徒德，程元斟認無此必要，司徒德指出條例中頗多不能見諸實行者，且多刑法原已有規定者，例如禁止「公然以筵席款待或供給食宿交通」，毋乃太不近人情。程元斟認選舉舞弊為敎育與經濟問題，非法律所得防止，條例本意雖在保障窮光蛋，然其結果恐反成保護壞人工具、陳茹玄等則持不同看法，認有法勝於無法，選舉舞弊即在民主先進國家亦在所難免，不能因其不能防止，遂謂無參制單行法必要。我國初行選舉，非有規定不可，否則選舉將成一種賭博行為，有兩噸鈔票者即可壓倒有一噸鈔票者。呂復舉出民初賄選故事，力主非有單行法防制舞弊不司，不然有特殊勢力者即可為所欲為，而弱者將永無起訴之權。原提案人簡　三亦認此舉目的主要在予在權有勢者以一種等認此案關係重要，有全盤加以檢討必要，建議重付審查。最後孫兼院長起立發言，指出防止選舉舞弊，主要對象有三：（一）濫用權之地方行政張官，（二）左右選舉之有槍階級，（三）利用集團力量威脅團體內外人士之地方政治團體。條例草案對上述三者，皆未防止，似有掛一漏萬之嫌，草案旣不够充實與嚴謹，此案似以暫擱為宜，俟休會後再予審查。決議：俟復會後再予審查。</p>
<h3>休會期間如遇緊急情形　得召開臨時會議　普通案件可先辦再補行手續</h3>
<p>立委劉盥訓等五十人臨時動談：立法院五日起至八月三十一日止在立院例會中討論時，孫兼院長先報告國務會議四日晨開會情形，據稱：會中張院長曾提及在立院七·八兩個月休會時期中，政府若有較為重要方案，需要完成立法程序者將如之何！會中僉認重要軍事措施，自不能因立法院休會而久擱，其他案件可按過去國防委員會時代前例、先辦，再補行手續。孫氏繼稱，在本院休會期間，如遇緊急情形非開會不可者，得召集臨時會議，京滬等地立委不難趕來開會。孫九錄等亦指例根據立院組織法，有三分之一立委出席，即尼法定人數。目下交通方便，飛機朝發夕至，彼此若聯絡得宜，即開臨時會亦不難趕到。最後決議自五日起休會，九月初復會。按立院自去秋以來，十個多月中，最重要工作為制定憲法車案，及各種行憲法規，截至今日止，先後完成六種組織法，四種選舉罷免法及選罷法施行條例，國民大會代表，立法委員各種名額分配表，亦已擬成，行政院前院長宋子文及現院長張羣等、咸曾蒞院說明施政方針，不特在制定行憲法規上厥功甚偉，即在實行民主憲政上亦多貢獻，休會個聞，各立委將分赴各地考察憲政，秋後　來時，對行憲必多新貿獻。</p>
<h3>國大婦女代表名額分配表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立法院四日例會中通過之國大婦女代表名額分配表，係根據三三一次會中孫兼院長所指示之原則編製，即各省市以兩名為基本數，一六八名女代表中，除全國婦女幽體二十名及基本數九十八名外，所餘之五十名，根據立委名額分配表之人口數字，分配各省市，各省每滿一千萬人增加一名，其另數超過五百萬者再增一名，但每省總數以六名為限；各市每滿一百萬人增加一名，零數不計，但每市總額以六名為限。茲誌全國性婦女團體及各省市名額如後：全國性婦女團體廿名（以各省市有五個以上分會其分會會員名册報社會都有案者為限），蘇六，浙四，皖四，贛四，鄂五，湘五，川六，康二，冀五，魯六，晋三，豫五，陝三，甘二，靑海二，閩三，台二，粵五，桂三，滇三，黔三，遼寗三，安東二，遼北二，吉林二，松江二，合江二，黑龍江二，嫩江二，興安二，熟二，察二，綏二，寗夏二，新疆二，蒙古二，西藏二，京三，滬六，平三，津三，靑島二，渝三，大連二，哈二，穗三，漢二，瀋三，西安二，共一六八名。</p>

<p>〔合社東京四日電〕據悉：日本九十歲高齡之老議員尾崎行雄，四日向衆院議長提出未來和約之決議草案，請其提交議會。尾崎提議將來應舉行公民投票，以決定「滿洲」，台灣，琉球，及朝鮮之未來地位。尾崎之和約決議草案，計有下列三點：（一）「滿洲」，合灣，及琉球應置於聯合國監察之下，至公共和平恢復之時，應舉行公民投票，以決定該處人民是否希望獨立抑願附屬何國。（二）賠償問題，應根據雙方所受之損失而言，賠款應付予損失最重之一方。（三）如果戰勝國在解決賠償問題時，不顧此項合理意見，則日本應以不合作而反對其要求。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕英國駐滬總領事奧克登，於昨日下午四時在該領事館，以英帝國勳章（O.B.E.）一枚，授予一中國籍輪機畏沈祖挺，以裘獎其在戰時英勇史績。典禮頗為隆重，參加者有外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國　，英駐華航運參贊伊凡斯，駐滬海軍參謀巴洛特，海軍助理參謀布朗，陸軍助理武官密勒，及沈之友好等多人。緣沈於戰時服務英國商船隊，一九四三年八月十日，任「萊特巴萊」號輪輪機長，奉命赴東菲洲接濟軍用物資。十三日晚，該輪不幸遭德潛艇襲擊，迅即沉沒，船長殉職。沈君則率領全船餘生三十九人在海上漂流，至黎明覓得一救生艇。時食糧僅足維持三天。幸至第三日發現前面有一小島，經海員等奮力前進而達。然該島乃一荒島，沈君等竟開始羅濱遜似之漂流生涯，搜獲山羊島蛋為食物，搭草屋而居，並由沈君設計，將救生艇汽桶改製蒸溜器，將海水製成飲水。如此竟茍延達八十日之多。至十月廿五日，守望海員在遙遠空中發現一偵察機，即由彼等將平時尋獲之生膠數梱燃燒，黑烟冒冲上空作為信號，卒為該機發現，拋下糧食與飲料。至十月二十八日，始由英護航艦隊獲訊後，駛近島旁，救起全體海員登艦，至東菲洲登陸，分批遣回印度。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>總動員狀態的再實施</h3>
<p>日昨國務會議通過蔣主席交議之有關時局重要提案一件，據報載消息，文長達二千餘字，其案由：「為拯救匪區人民，保障民族生存，鞏固國家統一，提請厲行全國總動員，以戡平共匪叛亂，剷除民主障礙，如期實現憲政，貫澈和平建國方案」。截止撰稿時止，我們還不曾讀到此項具有歷史意義文告的全文。所以對於此項文告的含義，我們無從加以評論。但是最近一周來，國內報紙旣咸載中央將有重要的決議：全國的人民亦無時不希望中央最高的決策機關能將混沌的國內局面早日予以澄淸；所以他們希望國務會議之能有早日的決策，原來已非一日。昨日國務會議所通過的決策，不是民衆所期望的討伐令，僅是一種文告，這或許使一部份人士感到失望；但我們却認為這却是適時的舉措，共黨的橫行不法，原應下令討伐，以正視聽的；這我們已一再言之。不過鑒於最近的最高法院已下令通緝毛澤東，此在法律上已承認毛澤東為叛國，有此一舉，我們政府冉下討伐令，實在沒有什麽意義；而且反予他們以重視，從一個明智的角度下加以觀察，實在不是一件智慧的事。</p>
<p>可是昨日的國務會議雖不曾決定下令討伐，却已將全國重新置在戰時體制之下。總動員的實施，已將全國從平時變為戰時。中國的人民在經過了長期的抗戰以後，好容易挨到了抗戰勝利；初不料勝利不久，全國又將回復到戰時體制。對於昨日國務會議的決議，全國人民於明知中共的作亂非加緊軍事的措施不可外，總期望戰亂的不致擴大。如今這希望是幻滅了。中共所依恃的是武力，我們非以武力擊潰它不可。在這情勢之下，有兩點非加聲明不可：</p>
<p>（一）從消極方面來說，中共不但竊據國土，擁兵稱亂；而且勾結外力，此其所為，實犯「危害民國緊急治罪法」之規定，應該繩以國法，以正人心的。只因「危害民國緊急治罪法」以政協的召開而宣告廢止，所可惜者，不因此項法律的廢止而能免於危害民國的罪行。共產黨固然危害民國，其它表同情於中共而有行為者，亦何嘗不危害民國；所以我們此際所欲提出的，就是鑒於國務會議的決議，我們希望政府能够重新宣布「危害民國緊急治罪法」之賡續有效。蓋中共的危害民國，本不限於戰區，後方也不能倖免。我們並不感到詫異將中國重置在戰時的狀態下，但我們希望後方與戰區並重，動員法令與危害民國法令相等重視；所以總動員之後，我們願「危害民國緊急治罪法」的重行得以實施。</p>
<p>（二）就積極方面言，中共之猖獗，原有種種客觀的理由，消弭中共，與其從軍事，實母寗從政治着手。政治軍事是不可分的。假如我們的政治修明，試問中共更能有什麽藉口？所以我們不能以戡伐中共為滿足，必須修明政治，纔能使人民知所歸趨。而且在修明政治這一點，也不能僅以民主為號召；民主而沒有民生為其基礎，也是徒然。當今政府唯一的課題便在安定民生；民安而後始能有民主，這是我們所應認識的第三點。</p>
<h3>從物價談判到復耕運動</h3>
<p>物價變動的主要原因，不外兩種，一是貨物量，二是貨幣量。所以要調節物價，穩定物價，或抑平物價，祇有從此兩處下手，纔是根本的辦法。</p>
<p>因為過去種種辦法，多半是枝節的，治標的性質；沒有能把上述兩種辦法，切實地，和系統地大量推行，所以物價愈平愈動，愈壓愈漲，到現在，以種種關係，雖還有人主張重彈舊調，冀以出奇制務的手段，狠簡便地把漲風壓伏下來，但一般人對於此等手段，都不免存着幾分疑慮心理，而寗可審其熱望於幣制與生產方面。</p>
<p>整理幣制和鞏固幣値，本文且不談，專談生產。就是說：如何增加生產量，使供給能漸漸地投合需要，以穩定或平落其</p>
<p>就生產而論，又可分為兩大部：一·工藝品，二·晨產品。在目前看來，以努力農產品的增加尤為急要。這理由是很簡單的，我國大多數的人民，還是從事於農業，農產增加，一方面解決了他們的一計，另一方面，即是增加大量物資，可以供消費，供製造，乃至可以供出口，易外匯，增稅源，裕民食，而减少失業，减少盜賊，增進治安，抑平物價等等，尙其餘事。不看見現在許多工廠的窘况嗎？外匯請不到，原料無法入口，便皇島然有閉廠之慮。農村　落，多數人的購買力减退，又皇皇然有滯積難銷，周轉不靈之苦。照此看來，工藝品之增產，還待於農產品之增加；其因果甚為顯然。所以不談增加生產則已，要談增加生產，雖然應從農產入手，這是毫無疑問的。</p>
<p>那麼，為什麼不趕快從此處着手呢。我毋要知道：過去和現在，並不是絕對忽視農村，也並不是無所作為，而實在是所採的方法，太不切實，太不應時的緣故。</p>
<p>凡是一種方案，總須適應環境，藥不對症，與無藥同，甚或加重了固有的病態，所以單是抄襲他人的騐方，或是高談病理，忽略了臨床的實診，斷非應病與藥的原則所許可。現在的農村，是一個同時俱發症；其病情，確乎太複雜了。約略說來：如（一）水·　·風雹等天為，（二）螟蝗等虫害，（三）內亂，匪盜，苛雜，攤派，　役，徵用等人禍；（四）種籽，肥料，農具，資金等的缺乏；（五）技術的落伍；（六）水利的失修；（七）外貨的傾銷；（八）出口貨銷路的滯塞等皆是。而其最嚴嚴重的致命傷，端為：</p>
<p>一，壯丁拋棄田園，散至四方；</p>
<p>二，欲耕無資，廣田自荒；</p>
<p>三，農產品不能比例其他物價，同樣上漲，以至貧困日深；</p>
<p>四，剝削太重，民不聊生；</p>
<p>五，家庭手工業，為新興企業和洋貨所打倒，副業的途徑</p>
<p>如能對症發藥，針對以上諸病態，急起直追，分別療治，則積日累月，自不難漸有起色。而且（一四）兩項，皆由人事未臧，並不難加以改革。只須渙汗大號，盪煩滌苛，使農民有業可樂，有居可安，便不必撫輯勞徠，而自然相率歸農，重整其田園之生活。其（二）項農業資金與肥料，種籽，農具等等，現在不少農業金融的機構，也不少外來的救濟品，如能簡化手續，分配得宜，不集中於有限的地區和事業，不斤於繁瑣的程序和形式，則日計不足，歲計亦可有餘。其比較的難期速效，而必須提倡輔導，逐漸滋長的，只有第（五）副業一項。</p>
<p>現在實際的對策如何呢？行政院所擬的經濟改革方案，是比較最具體的；其中發展農業一項，列舉九條辦法：（一）改革農地之分配關係，儘量設法，實現耕者有其田；（二）舉辦集體農塲，利用新式機器，及方法；（三）發行公債，積極興修水利；（四）擴充合作社，以便利農貸；（五）積極普遍建築倉儲制度；（六）廣設苗國；（七）訓練技術，發展副業；（八）發展畜牧，（九）獎勵漁業。這個方案，如果單從文字方面來看，自然也算綱舉目張，有條不紊；不過從事實上推究起來，便覺得還有幾種缺點，都是顯而易見的。其一，大都曠日持久，需要長期間的準備；不適於濟急之用；其二，（一）（二）（三）（五）諸項，至少在目前恐怕還辦不動；其三，耕者其田，是扶植小農制的，與利用新式機器之集體農塲，性質上並不一致；其四，前文所舉目前農村最嚴重的致命傷，有許多地方，竟沒有觸及。我們並不敢自以為是，一定說：自己是對的。但目前農村已到了需要急救的地步，與農產物的增加，不能期待諸長期間以後，而且也不一定要待諸長期間以後，這似乎總是事實。所以一面儘管治本，一面却不可不迅速治標。而且安定農村，農民歸耕，汰除煩苛，解除疾苦，這幾項固屬治標之計；却也未始不是治本之圖。倘使離散的農民，無法使之歸耕，所種的農產，無法使之獲利，那麽土地儘管重行分配，農貝儘管機械化，技術儘管科學化，而隴畔輟耕，興嗟猶昔，不知靠誰來利用這些土地和新式機器？勞力是生產要素之一，沒有勞力，便談不到生產，更何從談到增產？語云：生之者衆，食之者寡，則財恒足矣；我們要希望以物來控物，以量來控物，那就不得不側重於農產物之增加，要求農產物之增加，尤不得不儘先要求所謂復耕運動了。</p>

<h3>杜魯門發表獨立節演說　暢論和平先決條件　對蘇聯政策暗中加以斥責</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日專電〕美總統頃為美國獨立紀念，在傑弗遜總統故宅發表廣播演講，呼籌美人及世界各國，打破人造之藩籬，使渠等不相隔絕，並敦促相互容忍，使導向和諧世界之智識與理想，得以自由交流。杜氏推崇傑弗遜總統「不可讓渡權利」之哲學，此一至理，現已訂人聯合國憲章。渠指出和平之四大要件，（一）為共同遵從政府之公正權力，係由被治者之同意而來之原則；（二）為共同尊重人類之基本權利；（三）為全球人民對各種智識理想及消息，作充分而自由之交換，國際之旅行與通訊應獲最大自由。（四）為各國制訂財政與經濟之政策，以支埃世界經濟，而非個別之國家主義之經濟。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社佛吉尼亞州却洛泰斯維爾城四日電〕杜魯門總統今日在此間發表演嚴，嚴祠抨擊蘇聯反對馬歇爾國務卿之經濟援助計劃一事，雖未直指莫洛托夫之名，但所言皆係抨擊蘇聯之能度，以致巴黎經濟會議失敗，措詞嚴厲而率直。略謂，此種反對馬歇爾建議之情形，宛如一人以妨碍其私事為由，而拒絕合夥經營有利之商業，實屬謬妄。國際間缺乏信任，乃造成戰爭之主要原因，和平相守之國家間，尤應樹立政治與經濟合作關係。美國對於建立和平經濟狀態，業已盡其一切義務，但僅一個國家信守其責任以復興世界，則尙嫌力量不够，此需所有國家互相合作，方能竟此全功，衣食住今仍為急迫之需要，尙待各國之努力加以解決。以言外國之反美宣傳，某某數國乃在故意歪曲他國之事實，向其國民宣傳，使之產生不信任或蔑視鄰國之心理，此種行動實使人民走入歧途，與締造和平與統一之努力背道而馳。今有若干國家其政府復箝制民意，要知能以民意制定國策，呼聲愈强，則侵略之危機愈可减少，故各國政府能順從民意，則永久和平庶幾有望。吾人之目標非僅圖目前之和平而已，亦在謀求永久之和平。</p>

<h3>麥帥撰文痛斥　專制主義國家</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約三日電〕麥克阿瑟為美國獨立紀念，特致書『生活雜　」，內稱：「在專制主義控制人民之生活，並使其他民族陷於其奴役人類之桎梏時，和平將遭阻礙，而戰爭之危機，將形迫近」。麥氏並未指明實行專制主義之國織，然芻所指為何實毋庸懷疑，　氏特於函中向美國人民呼籲『以大無畏之精神，履行吾人對其他人民之責任」。並使渠等邁向和平之世界，而謀致人類良好之關係。</p>

<h3>巴黎三國外長會議失敗　或將影響英蘇貿易談判</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科三日電〕消息靈通人土今夜聳稱：巴黎三國外長會議失敗，與英國不顯蘇聯態度決定繼續推行馬歇爾計觀二事，對於目前英蘇貿易談判或將發生嚴重影響。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕英國雖己在巴黎會議與蘇聯決裂，但將繼續在東歐推進擴張貿易計劃。據政府發言人今日稱，內閣已考慮此一問題，艾德禮總理曾用電話與巴黎方面貝文外長交談。貝文今夜返此，擬即與艾德禮會晤。外交部發言人稱內閣或將召開特別會議。英國官方預料東歐數國將拒絕參加七月十二日之巴黎會議，但蘇聯，匈牙利與南斯拉夫境內之英國貿易代表團仍將與各該國商訂貿易協定。大約英國將根據多邊與互惠基礎推進其國外貿易政策，不摒棄任何一國。</p>
<h3>對英法政府邀請　各國正考慮答覆　馬卿支持英法團結歐洲之努力</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕英法兩國政府業已向二十二個歌洲國家政府發出請柬，邀其於七月十二日在巴黎集會，共同討論馬歇爾之援歐計劃。各該國政府今夜已均在考慮答覆中。同時馬歇爾國務卿已在華盛頓向英法兩國保證，表示支持英法之團結歐洲響應援歐計劃之努力。</p>
<p>歐洲國家之反響概述如下：瑞典外交部發言人否認巴黎報告所稱瑞典畏懼蘇聯，尙不敢參加馬歇爾計劃下設計之說。半官方面并曰瑞典亟欲參加此項工作。捷克內閣或將於星期五開會，以鄭重考慮參加馬歇爾計劃及英法召開之會議與否。捷克之參加東方或西方陣容，已臨最後決定階段。一般均認捷克雖與東方有政治上之同盟關係，然在其他種種方面仍大多倚賴西方。奧京維也納之政界人士料奧國殆將決定接受英法之邀。社會黨發言人聲明接受英法之邀，並不足以表示奧國之依附西方集團。匈牙利之緩進份子及反對黨，對於英法蘇在巴黎之會談原寄予甚大之希望，談判之失敗使彼等深感失望。義大利一般與論可由羅馬之獨立報紙「消息報」見之，該報稱「西方集團之基石已由蘇聯代表奠定，不數日內。英法即將開始在此基石上建築墻垣」。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎三日電〕英法兩國政府已正式邀請歐洲二十二國政府派代表於七月十二日在巴黎開會，共同討論馬歇爾之援歐計劃。些二十二國為葡萄牙·愛爾蘭·冰島·比利時·荷蘭·盧森堡·瑞士·義大利·丹麥·瑞典·挪威·芬蘭·南斯拉夫·阿爾巴尼亞·希臘·捷克斯拉夫·彼蘭·匈牙利。羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·奧地利及土耳其。據法國外交部發言人稱：各國之接受邀請，僅表示在原則上接受法國之計劃，任何參加七月十二日會議之國家，均得提出修改之意見。西班牙暫時並未被邀，其意乃為西班牙政府如有變更，即將被邀參加會議。法國計劃關於德國之部份，規定德國各區間及對他國之物資交換，各區總司令已同意予以合作。</p>
<h3>英法仍盼蘇聯參加歐洲復興</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三日電〕據消息靈通人士談稱：法國外長皮杜爾與英國外相貝文今晨曾舉行會議，決定繼續討論馬歇爾援歐計劃，即使蘇聯置身事外，亦在所不顧。英法兩國業已致函蘇聯駐法大使鮑哥莫洛夫，告以請柬業已發出，並解釋英法兩國政府希望蘇聯之拒絕參加，並非最後決定，而仍能參加討論歐洲經濟復興計劃。</p>
<h3>印尼新聞成立　荷蘭反應冷漠　認為不能改善雙方關係</h3>
<p>〔　　新開社會牙三日電〕據可靠　息：荷朧政界人士認為印尼共和國由前國防部長夏利福亭為內閣總理，組成新權，對於荷印雙方關係并無良好影響，故此間人士聞之并不表示熱烈歡迎，并謂夏利福亭與沙利之態度，　　二致。惟官方對於荷印能否成立協定一層，均拒不加以評論云。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃　恐難獲國會支持　國會與政府意見相左之點頗多</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕美國外交家認為蘇聯拒絕馬歇爾計劃，對於單獨撥款援助西歐更易辦理，然此事四日在國會已產生危險信號。</p>
<p>連續之事件，已使若千外交家願出力將計劃贈與議會者，發生猶疑。國會通過額外之數百億款項，即使專供歐洲使用者，根據官方之意見，亦將成為「淺嘗即止之提議」。官方認為國會最近情勢之發展，有下列事實，値得注意：第一，衆院撥款委員會主席泰柏爾發表聲明稱，國務院未能對援助希土之四億元，說明其正當理由，迄今為止，尙未指定數項為該計劃之用。第二，泰柏爾以相同之理由，反對撥款三萬七千萬元授權國務院供國外救濟之用，其中一部分撥與西歐一部分撥與中國。第三，參議員塔虎脫對國務院所要求之進出口統制權延長一年，以便對於稀少之商品能平均分配，指斥其不當。塔虎脫特別反對繼續統制脂肪及食油，該兩項物品之缺乏最為嚴重。國務院官員深懼國會此項反響，將影響歐洲胆怯之國家，而不敢毅然參加西歐經濟自力更生計劃。渠等指出，如對國會另撥基金援歐發生懷疑，則馬歇爾計劃有崩潰危險，此一發展，將大有利於蘇聯云。</p>
<h3>美眾院外委會主張　停止向德日索取賠償</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕衆院外交小組委員會今日提出報告書稱，美國必須堅持停止向德日兩國索取賠償，俾該兩國經濟得以自給自足。此項報告書之提出，適在花園聯拒絕美國務卿馬歇爾援歐復興計劃之後一日，并稱，「吾人不信此乃美國援歐終止之謂」。報告書估計自一九四七年至四九年三年間，歐洲復興須美國以貸款或贈予方式，資助美金一百億元之譜，此數包括英國在內，但蘇聯除外。</p>
<h3>德境英美兩佔領區　政治合併更趨接近　合立曼安特遜聯袂抵柏林</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕德境美軍總司令克萊將軍，今日在此間招待記者發表談話，表示「希望巴黎三國外長會議之失敗，不致增加統一德國之困難，但任何使德國與統一工作更趨困難之狀態，將使吾人政治合併之趨勢更趨接近。」詢以是否有任何發展，可使英美兩區在十一月倫敦外長會召開以前，更接近政治合併。答曰，目前當然尚未考慮及此。復詢巴黎會議之失敗，是否將促成法國區之與英美區合併。克氏表示如法國願意參加，英美自極為愉快。克氏并謂，紐約市建設專員莫斯，已應渠之邀請抵德，研究魯爾區房屋問題，并建議增產煤斤之步驟。美商務部長哈立曼農業部長安特遜於今日抵柏林，亦係為同一目的。彼等於徼得英當局之同意後，將赴英軍區視察。克萊并謂，哈立曼復將研究德國之出口問題，而安特遜亦將調查德國之糧食狀况。</p>

<h3>美各大學英文考試不阻外籍生活求學</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約三日專電〕頃自權威方面獲悉：美國各大學對外國學生所舉行之英文考試，並非爲我國及其他國家學生獲得赴美　留學簽證之必要條件。英文考試是否及格，由各學校自行決定，故舉行考試，對外國學生獲得留學簽證並無影響，但如以美國大學之許可爲呈請簽證之必要條件者，則不在此限。外國學生如在茶一大學經英文考試失敗，仍可再向其他無需考試之學校進行入學事宜，因此英文考試，並不阻碍外國學生赴美求學。而美國大學是否採取考試辦法，亦各有不同。此種考試，將由大學入學考試委會主持，並由國務院供給經費。該委會原在辦理美國各大學入學考試事宜，然亦常決定其他敎育上之方針或計劃。此次外國學生之英文考試，即其一端。至該委會對外國學生考试試之詳情，現尙不悉，然該會在歷史上所採之政策，均極爲公平。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會於昨日下午三時許，召開理監事聯席會議。由理事長王啓宇主席，討論至六時許散會。</p>
<p>昨日重要報吿案件五起，（甲）紡綢會辦理聯合配銷一案，該案經紡調會第三次委員會議，詳加討論，認爲聯合配銷之原則，尙屬可行。惟詳細辦法，應於兩星期內，另行商定。但先行自本月二十日（星期一）起，辦理臨時聯合配銷。其辦法，　由國營民營紗厰，各提出廿支棉紗一萬件，交紡調會配售（由紡調會成品配銷小組委員會，督同業務處辦理）。自本月二十日起，各分十五日，，平均交足。民營紗厰應交棉紗，由六區公會負責送交紡調會核收。</p>

<h3>買氣突又轉旺　華股多數回漲　華豐勤與等升達限度</h3>
<p>股昨初平後俏，永紗屢進屢返，倍見　忽，但各小型股若華豐新光等十分穩健尤以華豐搪瓷有新氣象，逐節進展首先漲達限度。經此轉變，買機逾恒，局面遂吿　展，於是永紗市價感覺十分合算，　帮銀行帮吸納於先，活動份子　隙而超，檯面驟形　竭，塲外　息亦减低至二角四至二角八分半，午刻　　反動，雜牌各股頗多漲達限度者，但前途當視銀根爲轉移。</p>
<p>晨初人心仍無興緻，現交各股衹有華體開高少許外，餘股均朱開成。遞永紗登塲亦見微昂，開後七一號六五號一四二號一四號二二四號二三二號二二八號二一二號納胃見殷，一七七號並進現永紗，而將遞永紗拉上至八五〇〇元。一五七號八五號趁勢脫手、一九〇號一八三號三二號尙納，而形拉鋸，七三號八五號一二八號二二三號了結而低至八四〇〇元內。一八五號四號買進現永紗，二二二號亦購　永紗，再回升至八五〇〇〇元外。一七號有供，稍有掙扎，一五七號一度買進，一六〇號一四二號二二號更進至八六〇〇元。七三號一五七號二三一號儿西號一一〇號二二號七六號几一號八三號紛紛出　，降爲八三五〇元。一〇六號二三五號一八〇號趁低進至八四七〇元。一五七號賣意不怠，而一〇二號則進，又吿徘徊。</p>
<p>後以六一號一七一號一五七號爭唐現永紗，一四八號七一號並　出遞永紗，四八號亦有供給，遂吿迫低至八二七〇元左右，即交永紗退爲八一〇〇元左右·二一五號二二四號一二天號乘低進至八四五〇元，九一號二一九號尙賣到八三〇〇元內，嗣後即因各小型股及雜牌有進無退，華豐在一〇七號領導之下，重振旗鼓，首先由一〇七號及八號等，分別將現遞拉高至漲停板。於是永紗在萬衆異常覺得便宜之情况下，亦激起賈風。二〇七號三一號銀行帮，以及活動份子，二二四號一六〇號四號等，二三二號六五號一五八號四一號八號三二號，均來爭買，逐步上騰，臨收更爲激昂。勤興新華麗安迫近漲限有成交，永泥由一七四號，國貨由一五三號，中法由五九號，紛紛漲達限度，遞永紗遂漲到八七五〇國元，即父永紗亦達八四三〇元高價結束。收後一四號等有買，喊高至八八〇〇光景。</p>
<p>結果較前收，計即交各股華豐勤興漲停，景福升一成，永紗信和新光永公各漲半成左右，美亞微升，新華中法亦達漲限，商務榮豐微降聯華平平，火柴內衣升半成，中紡景綸水泥各漲一成左右，餘股僅告微升。遞交股計華豐漲停，景福升一成，永紗新光各漲半成，美亞　和微升。塲外各老股計大生中華微升，世界南洋閘北華商五洲均見平定。</p>
<h3>公債外股疲軟</h3>
<p>公債昨讀在存多了結下趨疲，五五五室賣出，統丙晨開七三〇〇元，自七六六〇〇起步降至六三〇〇元低價結束，結會較前收計甲乙跌七百一元，丙降一千一，丁挫六百元，戊種亦小四百元，成交約一百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨　續下游，洋商及證劵帮雖納，金號業及廣帮都售，各股成形疲軟。交易寥落，以致供過於求？結果較前收計紙業跌一成弱，航業尙平，怡　業廣微降，餘股各跌半成左右。</p>
<h3>人絲被平後堅　廠經行情稍昂</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市初平後又堅挺，一二〇號天橋新貸開盤二千四百七十萬元，旭字喊四百五十萬元，卒因實銷戶前來稍有吸收，遂致人心轉好，冉冉上升。中午收盤價，旭字爲二千五百萬元，天橋新貨大十萬元，下午股市吿堅，厰絲亦呈堅穩綢厰帮續有進胃，以致更形俏利。最後五百六十萬元有成交，比上日價漲起一百萬元，七五號金鷄半光喊價隨之而升。</p>
<p>厰經昨市行情，較上日稍昻，交易尙稱不寂。Ｃ字等級三千二百五十萬一元有成交，D字等級做開二百萬元，Ｅ級一百五十萬元亦有交易，不過均有幾天期頭。ＡＢ等級，市上存貨甚稀，喊價較大、昨市未曾做開。干經市况較靜，五擔有單十貨喊價仍在二千二百萬元之譜，零擔一千九百五十萬至二千萬元。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市，被面大誠貨二百三十萬至三十五萬元有成交，輩强貨在二百二十萬至二十五萬之間。大　格子壁　始終在四萬一千二三百元之間盤旋，最小一百元，最後成交爲三一百元，隔日期做一千四五百元，比上日大五百元。華錦縐高檔貨二萬十二千五百元，次者二千五百三元有成交，亞令配克去胃甚好，高貨做三萬四五千元。次者三萬二三千元，頗有交易。其餘各貨，均堅站未更。</p>
<p>棉市平疲</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因紗價下跌，趨勢轉疲。惟高檔棉因細紗價俏，紗厰仍有需求，價難回小。普通擋頭，各方納胃不大，脚地較軟。客戶以來源不旺，滬上存底不多，亦不肯賤售。交易較上日稍旺，各檔做開送厰價，計　寳二〇二萬，沙市特種一九二萬。又　交價計劃一八七萬至一九八萬。沙市一八五萬，　米特林一九七萬，漢口細絨一六〇萬，冲　洲一六一萬，南太創一六一萬，東溝一六〇〇萬，浦東火機一四四萬，一五〇萬至一五五萬，周浦籽花每組二六萬五千至二八萬五千。</p>
<h3>試練曁辦法　產銷會修正通過</h3>

<h3>買氣銷沉去化呆滯　食糧　致下跌　高白粳昨下挫二萬餘元</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧五千六百餘石，各糧一致全面下降。秈米以長江各埠均有到申，而津浦綫及蘇北亦有到源，去化呆滯，苦無受主，繼續狂跌三萬一元。粳米亦然，步跌二萬元，白元陰元跟跌一二萬元，中次客元猛挫二三萬元，尙少問津。</p>
<p>麵粉以內地步跌，隨之急轉直下，再見狂落八九千元，洋粉暴跌一萬三四千元，麩皮猛跌三四千元。豆餅賣氣濃厚，直綫下瀉，慘跌五六千至六七千元不一。黄豆亦因油餅俱降，隨之不振，劇跌三五千至萬元。赤豆南洋不動，本銷看望，猛挫二三萬元。生仁南洋本街均少成交，猛跌一二萬元。紅糧亦削萬元苞米再低三五千元。蠶豆客帮不動，軋短三五千元。小麥厰方全無納胃，正在看小之中，再跌三五千元。菉豆到銷兩少，形居站定”中次帶挺萬元。　油市一片賣出声中，納戶看望，華南不動，營口已有來貨，川貨續到，人心虛軟，生豆油及淸汕均一致暴落三萬元之　。菜油亦低二三萬元，而以熟菜油消化最爲呆木。惟小車藤油因夏令素食者多零化尙可，形成暫平之格</p>
<p>本月半前試辦配油</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：市社曾局局與中央信託局，將於本月十五日前，先合作試辦計；配油一次，配價將軟市低康配油有生油及豆油兩種，每次每口可配油半市斤。根據本年五月底全市人口調査，總數約爲四百十七萬人。故一次之配油量，預計須二禽〇八百五十市擔。聞中信局刻已準備配油量一個月，以備經常配售市民云。</p>
<h3>食糖略軟</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平軟，間有略跌。公會劃盤，惟秘魯砂所跌較多，初爲六十六萬五千元，後爲六十四萬五千元，小二萬許。二〇中砂白六十一萬元至六十萬元小萬元，台赤五十七萬元至五十六萬五千元，二四粗白六十八萬五千元至六十九萬元。四半車白初　六十三萬元至六十三萬八千元，後爲六十二萬元，小二萬元土糖無甚更動，汕提靑四十二萬三千元至四十二萬元，棉赤四十七萬元，海南赤四十六萬元，成交不上百包。興化白特高，五十九萬元，至五十七萬元，興赤四十七萬至四十五萬元，成交三百數十簍，略見回好。刁靑三十八萬元，普通三十七萬六千元，成交三百包弱。</p>
<h3>外銷綠茶活躍　溫洲忙開價平稱</h3>
<p>外銷綠茶中之抽珍。珍眉等色，向以法屬非洲爲最大去路。昨日市上趨勢突吿活躍，揆其原因，彼地開放賣買之傳說，復又甚囂塵上。且本市出口茶商，對於卅五年度陳茶漸擬活動，人心似漸向榮，執貨者喊價亦比前爲挺，結果行情已見軋升。其他花色依然無人問津，惟本年度溫州新紅茶，在吐納積極磋商中，則已獲得開盤，聞上擋貨每担九十萬元，中擋貨每担七十二萬元，所開行情，尙稱平穩。至於紅綠茶內銷，邇因漸屆當令，益見良佳，價格方面，至稱銳利。</p>
<h3>英美捲烟堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，各方取捨不一，塲內交易平庸。華成公司開派萬支「金鼠」香烟，起價每條二廿元，計用卡三百五十條，已卡一二五條，丙卡五十條·又大中華烟公司派給「馬蹄」牌烟，每條三萬元，經售同行每家得派廿五條，致同業銀根抽緊，買賣閑數。</p>
<p>全日市勢以英美烟交易較暢。十支大英烟結果比隔昨續升七萬元，爲七百四十三萬元。老刀亦步挺三萬元，爲六百四十三萬元。五華哈德門亦吿微秀，華商烟美麗金鼠大克爾斯黄金龍，及高等大南未三砲台，趨疲外，其餘銀行紅人十字軍等條烟，回上一二百至二千元不一。美貨樂更駱駝馬立斯等條烟，因來貨不充，脚地穩固。　〔又訊〕五十支聽裝香烟，近由端節禮品，回籠貨甚多，門店帮收進不少，致存底　沛，胃口不開，市勢下游。茄力克每聽最後價五萬六千五百元，回降一千五百元。三五牌亦小二千元，爲四萬八千元。其餘白錫包小三砲水手牌等，一致下挫五八百元不等。</p>
<h3>市面銀根仍緊　國家行局差入頗鉅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六底行莊結算後，市面頭寸，並未見鬆。交換所方面，三日國家行局共差入一五三億元，洋商銀行差入二五四億元，直接交換商業行莊差入四十一億一元，而五十號以後代理交換行莊，共差出四四八億元。昨日情形，國家行局差人四百億元，洋商銀行差人六十六億元，直接交換行莊差出五十四億元，五十號以後行莊差出四一二億元。聞一般商業行莊，向國家行局及洋商銀行之拆款，近因當局査帳關係，須紛紛拔還，故連日有鉅額之差出。此外如經募美金債券，各項稅款，紡建出售紗布等款項之解繳，均爲促成國家行局鉅額差入之主因。故兩日來各小型行莊及業外圈方面，俱感頭寸緊俏，暗息待徊於二角一分至五分之間云。</p>
<h3>輪船業燃料油　供迎問題解決</h3>
<p>本市輪船業前以燃料油進口限額數量甚微，而需要激增，致供不應求，影響水上運輸，曾由該業公會推派代表分別向行政院及交通部請願，呼籲救濟，增加限額。嗣由中國石油公司會同本市美手亞細亞德士占三外油公司商討統奪供應辦法，聯合登報，請各輪船公司及備有　油機爲動力之工廠，將其所需油量於五月十七日前，向該公司上海營業所登記。現悉關於輪船業需用之燃料油之調査工作，業已竣事，計在本市申請登記之輪船公司，有民生公司等三十四家，船隻有天龍等五十一艘，每月需要燃料油總數爲一七四四四噸。由各油公司按輸入限額比例，及供應能力，分攤供應。計亞細亞六八二五噸，美孚五一八一噸，德士古二七二九噸，中國石油公司二七〇九噸，業已開始發售。故輪船用之燃料油供應問題，至此已暫時獲時合理之解決云。</p>
<h3>新紙幣一批　由英運抵滬</h3>

<p>國際合作節獻辭　合作或毀滅  王世穎　　在今日國內國外的紛亂情形之下，我們要提出這樣一個口號。「台作毁滅。」　　最近路透社有一個報道，說美國支加哥大學敎授艾里（Prof.W．C．Allee），近爲一九四七年大英百科全書＃一文，指出達爾文「物競天擇適者生存」的進化理論不能成立。他認爲動物（包括人類）從事於合作以後從事反社會的舉動，更來得自然。動物的生活，事實上受制於一條規律——就是合作或死亡。　　人艱在個人社會國家國際各方面傾向於美良，乃是自然的趨勢，正如人之趨向於智懸一樣的自然。集團生存的價値，顯然可以追溯到原始生活。社會生活並非是偶然的，它毋寗是一種正常的基本的普遍現象。　　其實艾里敎授所說的進化原則，與其謂爲創見，無寗謂爲闡述。這一百年來，各國合作運動者所孳孳以求硜硜自守的也無非是這個原則。尤其是孫中山先生更精湛的指出了互助是人類進化原則。他說：「人類初出之時，亦與禽獸無異，再經幾許萬年之進化，而始長成人性，而人類之進化，於是乎起源。此期之進化原則，人類則以互助爲原則。社會國家者，互助之體也。道德仁義者，互助之用也？人類順此原則則昌，不順此原則則亡。此原則行之於人類當已數十萬年矣。然而人類今日猶未能盡守此原則者，則以人類本從物種而來，其入於第三期之進化，爲時尙淺，而一切物種遺傳之性，尙未能悉行化除也。然而人類自入文明之後，則天性所趨，已莫之爲而爲，莫之致而致，向於互助之原則，以求達人類進化之目的矣。人類進化之目的爲何？即孔子所謂「大道之行也，天下爲公，耶蘇所謂「爾旨得成，在天若天，」此人類所希望，化現在之痛苦世界而爲極樂之天堂者是也。　　孫中山先生所說的「順此則昌，逆此則亡」正已指出了「合作或毁滅的鐵律。」　　這次世界大戰，表面上看是已經結束，事實上戰爭還在持續著，烽火通天，戰雲密佈，環宇之內，簡直是一片乾凈土都沒有。我們處此境地，能不懷然而懼，悚然以憂！我們放眼縱觀：無論在政治，經濟或社會上，競爭的原則，還具有壓倒的優勢；人們受此競爭原則的支配，幾乎羣　於瘋狂的一途。蠶食鯨吞，已不足形容其兇殘暴戾。這是一個何等可怕的現象！我們淸夜自思，我們自稱爲萬物之　的人類者，能不自慚無地。　　幸而合作運動經過了一百年的磨練，現已逐漸長成蔚爲大觀；至少在經濟方面已顯示了互助爲進化原則之確實性。這是　然而至的空谷足昔，這是炎夏的一服淸凉劑，這更是陰森氣氛中的一縷溫情。　　自然合作運動發　到現階段，　成功究滿之境還很　逮，尤其是咱們中國，更是羽　初具。犯說不上賽滿。可是，我們懷於「合作或毁滅」的敎訓，我們絕不能自　，也不應自餒。我們深信我們的抉擇是一個最聰明最正確的抉擇？競爭乃養性的遺留，合作是人性的發展，化競爭爲合作，是人類進化唯一的關鍵。　　回憶第一次世界大戰發生的前夕，國際合作聯盟鑑於國際間之劍拔　張，曾義正敵職的發出了和平的呼籲。可惜合作運動的力量還不够消滅戰爭，第一次世界大戰終於在一九一四年爆發。迨第二次世界大戰將瀕爆發、國際合作聯盟又同樣作過和平的呼籲先後在一九三八年與一九三九年的第十六屆與第十七屆的國際合作節，各發表了宣言、一名「透過合作的和平」一名「論合作和平與自由之不可分；」對於此次宣言，各方的反應都非常熱烈。一九三九年七月四日，國際合作聯盟，並曾以會長頓納Tanner與秘書長梅May的名義發出一篇文吿，其中有這麽一段話：「世界上的合作者們，放棄了可以削　你們行動的一切識破解與偏見，把你們經濟上的利益拋却在一邊，用你們最大的努力，來完成全世界人類的團結，以追求正義的最後勝利吧」！這次的呼籲可惜依然無用，第二次世界大戰，畢竟於是年九月爆發了，這一段史實說明了合作運動的力量，雖未能够龐大到阻止戰爭消滅戰爭，可是却表示出一種勇敢毋餒的精神，以及追求眞理的熱忱。　　今年的國際合作節，已是第廿五屆了，世界仍然是　隍擾　，有過　昔，我們一面對現實，　懷理想，不禁要喊出「合作或毁滅」的口號來，以警世人兼以自勵。　　美國　斯總統於一九四四年正月曾致函美國的合作者，中間有一句話說：「我深深預料到：在不久即將來到的和平歲月中全世界合作社所具的貢獻。」是的，我們合作者千萬不要自菲，因爲衹有我們纔是「合作或毁滅」定律的擁護者與實行家。（民國三十六七月。）合作經濟的演進  陳仲明　　合作經濟是資本主義經濟發生矛盾而成長的民主經濟運動，它是以資本主義社會爲背景而發生，並伴隨資本主義經濟之發達而發展的。資本主義經濟發達之後，在利潤追求之過程中，由於資本的日益集中化，生產手段與生產者的分離就日益普遍化；因之，人民大衆的生存權遂愈被少數人所掌握。合作經濟是作爲這種現象的反抗形態而出現的：以信用合作（或合作金融）抵禦集中化的金融資本，以利用合作奪回集中化的生產手段，以消費（供給）合作及運銷合作（或合作供銷）防止商業資本的獨佔。在資本主義經濟發展諸階段中，資本之支配的形態各異，因之，與此相對應的合作經濟之主流亦就不同。大體上，與商業變本相對應的是消費合作，與產業資本相對應的是工　合作，與金融資本相對應的是信用合作（或合作金融），而在帝國主義的現階段中，合作經濟之支配的形態則爲農業合作。　　合作經濟與資本主義經濟截然不同之點，就是：一則以共謀　利爲目的，一則以追求利潤爲目的，前者是自助互助共存共榮的，後者是自由競爭利潤獨佔的。因此，合作經濟雖是資本主義所孕育，同時也必然是資本主義經濟之否定物。　如上所述，合作經濟是資本主義經濟發展中的副產物，因之，就其發生的根源來看，實具有先天的反資本主義經濟之使命。英國是資本主義最先發展的國家，是以合作經濟也自英國發育其根基。當十九世紀的初期，英國資本主義發展後，最嚴重的社會問題，就是勞動問題。換言之，勞動者生活的困難，勞賣兩階級的對立，是當時一切社會問題的中心，因此各種社會主義，也都以解決這一問題爲目標，合作經濟便也以解決勞動階級生活問題爲主旨的消費合作的企業形態出現。　　及後，這一民主經濟運動　過海峽傳到歐洲大陸，萬先發展於法國，法國產業革命比英國擊了二三十年，當時的經濟情形與英國頗多不同，即法國因資本主義之發展而發生的最嚴重的社會間題，與其說是勞動者的貧困，無寗說是獨立小生產者，尤其是都市的手工業者受機械了業的壓迫而沒落的慘狀。因此法國的合作經濟企業便稍稍變了樣態，以救濟都市小生產者爲主旨的工業台作佔優勢。　　合作經濟傳掃到德國時，又以另一新的企業形態出現，從國的產業革命比較法國又遲了三四十年，後進資本主義國家爲要與先進資本　　國家相抗爭，往往以　業爲犧牲，以補助其工業的發展，而且，德國是小農國家，小農制的農業對資本主義的適應尤難。因之，德國資本主義發展後，其最嚴重的問題，是農村經濟的崩潰與農民的貧苦，是以合作經濟企業也以農村與農民爲對象，因此產生了農業合作。　　準此，如果我們從抽象上來探求合作經濟發展的路綫，可以說它是從英國的消費合作社出發，經歷了法國的工業合作，以都市及農村的信用合作爲過渡而歸宗到德國的農業合作。　　在這一轉化過程中，最初它是以勞動階級爲對象，其次是以小市民階級爲對象，最後以農民大衆爲其發展的社會基礎。因之，合作經濟實乃一個可變的歷史名詞，它的涵義，從過去到現在，在形勢上雖無大變更如一人一票的民主主義，特別分紅制等，而在其本質上則實有了重大的演變，消費合作之社會的意義，與農業合作幾乎完全不同，這是我們在研究合作經濟中所必須把握住的關鍵，只理解了合作經濟的形式，是空虛的無內客的，必須在歷史轉化中去把握合作經濟的本質，若忽略了合作經濟的社會　礎，而求一通用古今適合中外的涵義，是不可得的。過去曾有幾學者抓住合作經濟發展史的一個側面，當作全貌來看，把合作經濟的原則當作一種超時間空間永不變的法則，好像不是發展於現實社會，而是由於柏拉岡的理想世界推演出來一樣，可以推行於全世界的任何一個角落裏，至於千萬年後而永垂不朽，以致合作經濟的，效用不是被誇大到了妥當性限度以上，就是被拘執到需要的限度以上。例如：近代合作經濟學泰斗法國査理，季特，就只看到了消費合作，而忽略了工業合作，以他們的理論更不能說明以農民爲基礎的農業合作，拉薩爾對於工業合作雖則曾加以合理的說明，然而他也不曾注意到農業合作，以上只是抽象的指明合作經濟之轉化的主要過程，當然消費合作，並不限於勞動階級，工業合作亦不限於法國，那不過就其主要的或本質的部份加以指明而已。　　前面是就合作經濟之縱的發展而得出的結論，若對其横的分佈略加考察，則很明顯的是在資本主義宗主國與其殖民地中，雖則合作經濟同樣的存立與發達，但其合作經濟的本質正存在着極其的差異，同是宗主國中，先進資本主義國家與後進資本義國家也是存在着若干差別的，大體上說先進資本國家中消費者的合作企業，比較發達，而後進資本主義國家中則生產者的合作企業，尤其是農業合作特別發達，在殖民地及半殖民地國家中雖也與後進資本主義國家相似，以農業者的合作爲中心，但後者大多是自發的，是作爲一個社會運動而存在，前者則往往是誘導的，作爲一種社會政策而存在。　合作經濟最初雖爲資本主義國家的產物，但隨資本主義之向外發展，國內的榨取擴張而爲國際化之時，資本主義在　內所引起的問題，便也以新的形態出現於殖民地，因之殖民地與宗主國，其合作經濟的內容或本質雖不同，但其發生的根源——其爲由資本主義經濟中副產的對立物，則是一致的。這裏必須補充一點，即社會主義國家的合作經濟，例如：蘇聯的合作組織，其發生的根源及其所担負的歷史任務與資本主義國家中（宗主國及殖民地，）的合作經濟是存在着甚大的區別的，　　其次，在合作經濟發軔時期，尤其是世界第一個成功的合作社，羅虛戴爾公平先鋒社的合作網領中很明確的宣示著合作經濟之政治中立原則，這個原則曾被久爲各國合作企業者所奉行，但我們在各國合作經濟發展史中已經看到，不僅羅虛戴兩公平先鋒社的發祥地——英國已有合作黨的成立，表現其合作經濟已向政治方面各縣極活動，而助自從第一次世界大戰以且，由於農業合作發展的結果，合作經濟企業與政府漸結密切關係，尤其在第二次世界大戰中消費合作在若干國家中已成爲政府配給物資的機構，在現階段民主運動新潮澎湃中，合作這一民主經濟又正在伴隨着民主政治的開展而披上政治鬥爭的新裝，儘管在合作經濟理論中還殘存着前時代的客觀環境之意識反映，但在實踐過程中，合作經濟的政治超然地位，已無維持的可能，正像經濟的自由競爭時代被帝國主義的獨佔所代替後，自由主義化爲歷史的遺跡一樣，合作經濟的政治中立亦只是前時代的追懷而已。黃河馬上要攤牌了！  鄭州一日航訊　本報記者范世勤　　黄河的大汎與復堤的工程！這工程包括政府與中共之間是否合作！馬上就要機牌了。規在距離這攤牌的時間，只有短短兩個星期。聯總對於這一即將來臨的危險的塲面，已經撞起了警鐘：說是雙方不再黄河下游停止軍事行動，不僅魯蘇冀省數百萬農民將大受災禍，即復堤工作已完成部份，亦將全部毁滅。事情確實是這麽嚴重，因爲這次大汎，從花園口堵口以後，是第一次奔流到它的廢弛傾坍八年之久的下游舊堤之內，任何一處決口，可以　蕩千百萬的生　與無數頃的良田。　　脆弱的一環　　從花園口以下五十里的趙口在抗戰時間出過險，現在還是脆弱的一環，當然很是容易被大汎第一個擊破，因此那一段的隴海路就會被踏平，開封就在其威脅之下，開封以北二十五里的黑崗邊是同樣情形，再次到了蘭封西北的東壩頭，是前淸咸豐五年缺口的地言，這個重傷的舊　疤，也是大汎所欲尋隙而攻的一個大目標，那末它就能重溫它的馳騁蘇北放骸中原的舊夢；（江蘇父老一定淸楚，曾經在那裏一帶集資修了一條　，）據聯總顧問塔德最近考察下游沿岸情形回來說：長垣以東臨濮集與十里舖之間，是臉工最甚的部份，那裏可以造成南北泛濫，不管是政府區域抑是中共區域，都是大水所要吞噬的；還有濟陽附近沿岸一帶，也是險象環生，非得整修完整不足以抗大水猛擊。　　担憂兩地區　　上面所舉的例子，是其大者，是其較險者。還有兩個地區，是也不得不使人憂慮的：一個是在快到海口的三角地帶，據說，在抗戰以前，堤防已經傾圯，就是這次要復堤的話，聯總因爲限於恢復戰時受損毁之部份的原則之下，是無法爲力相助的，這是完全需要我們自己動手完成的；一個是在花園口上游的沁河方面，沁河與黄河相啣接，黄河大水可以倒灌其內，如今那河北岸是在共軍控制之下，其間武陟縣內的大樊，老龍灣兩個地方，曾經在抗戰中被敵人掘過口，後來由當地人民草草率率修理一下，其南岸虬橋與五車口，（也都屬武陟縣），戰事也曾決過口，雖於也會堵平了，可是現在這兩處僅僅高出水面一公尺，危險情形也是不堪設想，那兩處雖然沒有共軍，可是其西不到一二十里的虬街是在共軍手裏，隨時也是可擾亂你的施工。如果一旦黄水前來，武陟東面的木蘭店就會出毛病，豫北幾縣勢必陸沉。　　南北岸險工　　要說黄河沿岸的險工來，那是三天三晚說不淸，因爲黄河在歷史上決口一千多次；就從前淸以來廣武到開封一段決口的地方在北岸有李莊（淸雍正九年）磨店（淸康熙六十年）焦瑩（淸嘉慶十四年及康熙六十年）七堡附近（淸順治十五年及乾隆十六年）四處；在南岸有：核桃園（淸同治七年）楊橋附近（淸雍正元年及乾隆二十六年）萬　（淸康熙元年）萬難以東附近（淸雍正六年）新砦（淸道光二十三年）黑崗口（淸咸豐五年）楊莊以南（清道光二二一年）七處。　　劉伯誠借水　　日月如駒，時不我待，照黄河復堤聯合委員會第一次決定，復堤工程是限七月十五日以前要完成，距離現在，只有二個星期。這個委員會包括中共代表兩人，時間雖然迫促，但應該還可以順利進行。不過，這幾天，劉伯誠的五個縱隊，突然由豫北移動到了　縣以南地區的黄河邊上，這給關心黄河復堤的人的心頭上起了一片大烏雲。那末，如果劉伯誠眞的借黄河之水以殺人，人人必得誅之以祭黄河而後已。　　去年黄河上游沒有大冬，今春也沒有暴雨，目前黄河水位只有二千立方公尺的流量（大水可至一萬五六千），這些都是使人可以略略舒懷的，可是專家們都求認，這下游殘破舊堤正像退伍已久之卒沒有能力以抗　意來犯的精銳之師的大水一樣，現在只是以傷手足，而不害及心肺爲惟一的希望。</p>

<p>春秋	憶Ｓ君  鳳家　　偶從某報的一篇文章裏，得知Ｓ在某地犧牲了；據那位作者說，這不過是一個傳說，但他也沒有資料可以證實這個傳說的無稽。「Ｓ沒有死。」在生觀上我是這麼　望着的，但「世事茫茫雖自料」，自己何嘗不知道這不過是過種聊以自慰的想法吧了。Ｓ萬一不幸而眞的死了，在他因是求仁得仁，但在他的朋友們，總不兔要因之引起無窮的哀痛了。　　我第一次遇見Ｓ是在一九三七年底初夏　　一個微感鬱悶的正午，我和同學Ｚ從學校裏出來，準備搭一列需時不上廿分鐘的行程的火車到上海租界裏去。剛跨上車廂，Ｚ發現了有兩位熟人在那裏，便過去和他們攀談起來，旋又爲我們介紹了。其中一位溫文爾雅，戴着近視眼鏡，着醬色西服年約廿三四歲模樣的是Ａ，Ｍ；另一位年齡和他相彷，着的是長袍，戴上一頂半舊的法蘭西帽，拿着一根手棍；嘴唇很厚，有點翹起，臉上顯出一付倔强的神氣。他便是Ｓ。那時，正當文壇上高舉國防文學的旗幟的時代，在滬的詩人們，正醞釀組織一個全國性的詩歌團體，我們便以此爲題，聊了一陣天。軍抵上海，大家就分了手。　　過後，我才知道Ｓ和Ａ·Ｍ都是我們校裏的畢業同學，因此，第一次和他們相遇在一家茶室裏時，無形中也就消除了許多拘束。這期間，會面較多的是Ａ·Ｍ。Ｓ在上海躭擱了極短的一個時期之後，又回到武漢重操他的公務員生涯去了。　　一九三八年底冬天，Ｓ從香港（他是在武漢失守之際撤退到香港的）回到上海來了。在這時，這所謂「孤島」的上海，「一十方面是荒淫無恥，一方面是嚴肅工作」，但一般自由主義者的知識份子，旣無向現實拔刃相見的勇氣與毅力；同流合汚吧，却又爲良知所不許，因此他們却只有在矛盾苦悶中討生活了。我們中間的一些朋友便多少是屬於這一類的人物。但Ｓ一回來之後，却使我們大家增加了一些活力。　　Ｓ是健談的。我們在一起的時候，差不多總是他一人唱獨脚戲。他一邊抽着烟捲，一邊以他的帶着濃重的鼻音的低沈的聲調，娓娓地談着他在大後方時的所見所聞，說到高興處，他自己往往先縱聲笑起來了。　　Ｓ回到上海不久，他便是文藝界中的活動人物之一了。他同時編着兩個文藝雜誌，不斷地寫着文章，還要出席一些團體的講演或是指導什麼的。經過他一度的奔走，留滬詩歌工作者協會在一九三九年夏天成立起來了，它出了期刋「行列」，印出了一批掌書，對滬上的詩運動是盡了不算少的貢獻的。　　雖然不完全是，但多少是由於工作過度，Ｓ的本來很弱的身體愈來愈壞了，中間還會吐了幾次血，臉色總是顯得蒼白蒼白的。而他又不大願意休息調義；縱　，抽烟，深夜坐咖啡廳，有時整夜不睡。　　記得一次在Ｖ的家裏。是一　春寒料峭的深夜，屋子裏生着　火，各人的話都已說完了，但沒有一個人想走，一動不動無言地坐着，也許大家在沉思着一些什麽，咀嚼着一些什麽。漸漸地，桌上的蠟炬化爲死灰，通紅的　火也轉爲幽暗，以至熄滅了。一陣嘹亮的號角從鄰近的英國軍營義傳來，黎明升上了，我們才感到一陣倦意襲來，就在Ｖ的家裏的地鋪上擁被睡去。　　我們是常常過着這種生活的，這對於Ｓ的健康無疑是有着極壞的影響。我們中雖有人曾勸阻他，但他不把這事放在心上，當吐血的當口，他便小心了幾天，過後，便又一切照常了。　　一九三九年冬初，我離開了上海。以後，便沒有見到Ｓ的面了，彼此也沒有通過一次訊。僅在一九四〇年的夏天，從剛自上海來內地的Ｐ的口中，約略知道了他的一點近况；身體仍是很壞，文藝活動却更幹得起勁了。　　一九四二年底秋天ＨＹ夫婦從蘇州來信，講起Ｓ正埋頭在低氣壓的「孤島」寫作「耶穌傳」。當時我曾想像着他底心境一定是很寂寞的，但寂寞的對於他，也許正是很好的鍛鍊呢！　　隨後，從報上我得知他到了江南某地。並且也讀到了他一部份的充溢着戰鬥意志的文字，不久ＦＶ也到了那裏。爲了要走向羅馬，這些一向在思想上甚少相同之點却親密異恒的朋友，終於跨上同一條路了。　　然而，噩耗傳來Ｓ被犧牲了。Ｓ眞的犧牲了嗎？東望雲山，痛思無極！在他的死訊尙未全被證實的今天，我祝福他還健在！（六，廿六寄自成都）露絲與瑙密  凱爾德明　　有一苜以希伯來鄉村爲背景的關於露絲（Ruth）的詩，是歐美人士所熟悉的，一般學者還沒有找出這首詩的作者和描寫的人物是誰。那詩中有一段大意是「讓我不離開你，並且在跟隨你的時候不回頭：因爲你到那裏，我也到那裏；你住那裘，我也住那裏；你的朋友就是我的朋友；你的上帝就是我的上帝。」這段詩可以充分的說明這幅畫。凱爾德朗的名字首次列入藝術學院的名單是在一八五三年，其祖先爲西班牙人，一八三三年生於博愛地斯，平年在倫敦入學，一八五〇年起在雷氏學校攻讀，後入巴黎的藝術學校，一八六七年得加入皇家藝術學院，一八九八　　世。燈火  黃耘　　旅人是愛着燈火的。　　在黑暗裏，對燈火是多一麽渴望着。　　小的時候，慣常聽着老祖母，用乾癟的嘴唇說着旅人和燈火的故事。黑暗裏的一盞燈火，是會引着旅人走出迷途的。　　我還想起了在海船上，遙遙的看見海心的燈塔，那是路綫的指標。　　——於是燈火給予了我深刻的印象。我看見靑燈畔繞飛着的小蛾，它們是酷愛着光明，雖然在光明裏死滅。　　我對街頭的路燈，對它也有着無限的喜愛，每每行走在夜路上，我默數着一盞盞昏黄色的路燈，讓微弱的燈光，照着我的脚步，一直引我到目的的地方。　　我常這樣想：人類是這世界上的旅者，但，黑暗裏的燈火，是那麽吝嗇的發射出光芒。　　——在這黑暗的旅途上，有許多顆心，祈求着燈火的光亮；一盞燃在人類心上的燈火。　　有人說，這世界太黑了，大槪因爲是沒有燈火的緣故。題馬公愚騎虎圖  張大千　　東海黄公粤咒窮，我兄於此術偏工，羨君也是搏雕手，曾向華林喚小空。跨虎仙人去不還，同遊老友淚汍瀾（先兄善子逝世時，君有長詩哭之）；十年夢繞吳門路，留取金精與世看。法國的作家協會  P·苔佳著　徐仲年譯　　運照該會會章，資格很老的法國作家協會（Sociese　des　gens　de　Lettres）行將召集會員大會，改選一部份的理事，討論寫作職業的近代化組織。我曾經向該會同仁講過：居今之世，卻戴爾登（譯者按：十八世耙英國詩人）貧困自殺的慘事不致產生，因爲他如生在今日，可以保險啊。　　從一九三九年到一九四五年，會的組織很有變動，它的主要目的　是保障會員精神上和物質上的權益。它的業務一天擴充似一天。一九四四年，法國解放，該會更能引起當局的注意，因爲它的會員均能爲國家宣揚文化，贊襄大業。一九四四年十月至一九四六年二月，兆如·勒恭脫先生重任會長，頓使馬沙公館——即該會會所——恢復舊觀，忘去陷落時代的惡夢。一九四六年二月至一九四七年三月，嘉糜兒·賈普夫人繼之爲會長，精明强幹，建樹甚多，使該會本身事業配合建國大計，切實保障作家的尊嚴和寫作自由。　　由於勒恭脫先生的理想主義，由於賈普夫人的現實主義，該會的任務當能更爲擴展，而理事會負責諸君更願努力。繼賈普夫人爲會長的人選，以舍哈爾·普埃（Gerard　Bauer）呼聲最高，可稱全體擁護。　　在法國的文學界裏，作家協會會長一職是非常崇高的，猶如軍界裏的「元帥」。我們衹須看看該會自從成立（一八三八年）以來，誰當過會長，便可明白它的重要性了：最初有：維兒曼（譯者按：批評家），巴兒扎克（大小說家），禹古（浪漫派最大詩人），法朗所瓦·阿哈古（大科學家），維埃耐（詩人）等等；近於我們的則有：馬爾賽兒·廢萊芙（小說家），保兒·埃爾維歐（劇作家），維克托爾·馬爾葛里脫（小說家），舍耐·杜米克（法蘭西文學院終身秘書），比埃爾·杜古爾賽兒（批評家），埃德蒙·哈胡古爾（詩人），夏兒·勒·古菲克（小說家），埃德瓦爾·埃斯杜尼埃（小說家），比埃爾·勃諾瓦（小說家），嘉斯東·哈叔（批評家），法朗所瓦·莫里雅克（小說家），兆如·居阿梅兒（小說家），……幾乎整個法蘭西文學院都搬進去了。因爲，好久以來，當作家協會的會長，就是被選爲法蘭西文學院會員的先聲，－－雖則當會長者自己並無此存心。　　在這張著名人物的名單之後，行將加上舍哈爾·普埃先生的大名，那是確切無疑的。　　談論自己的朋友，最好引一個著名的先例。當年呂西央·苔佳芙（譯者按：他是本文作者比埃爾·苔佳芙的父親），在他的『一位遁世者的回憶」裏，有很生動的一章，描寫亨利·普埃道：「一位偉大的記者，從未做任何人的走卒，』又說：『在日報裏，他（亨利）坦白作戰』，『他提拔後進，保障受委屈的名人，使他們希望重熾，再獲生趣』。如果父輩相敬相愛如此，大概讀者不致責備呂西央·苦佳芙的兒子去稱頌亨利·普埃的兒子，說他是：法國智慧，尤其是千變萬化的巴黎精神的絕妙代表之一。受過了大師克萊蒙梭（譯者按：即一老虎總理」，是名記者）的薰陶，舍哈爾·普埃先生是名記者，倫理學家，諭文家。他曾經說：『浪費我的時間，去觀察一切：這便是我的愛好，恐怕也是我所最成功的事情』。不錯，他的時間固然浪費了，却節省了我們的時間，他把我們的時代忠實地記載下來了。記憶  江野　　時間帶得走人的靑春；却帶不走人的記憶。「人的心遭了一次傷害，就得永遠痛着。」人的記憶都是辛酸的呵。我的靑春是毫不美麗的。一種無依無靠的流浪生涯佔去了我年靑時日大半。我流浪，我貧窮我疾病，我過活得如一匹野狗。　　但我是珍護我的記憶的。因爲，就是在頂頂苦厄的辰光，我都未曾屈辱於生活。我不是如低等動物樣爬着過來的。站起了，跌倒；跌倒了，又站起，在苦厄的日子裘，我是掙扎着一步挨着一步過來的。當一個美麗的憧憬，碰上了硬生生的現實而破滅的時候，我會一個人默默地坐下來，或則到戶外去散一會子步，溫習一遍我記憶的辛酸。沉浸在辛酸的記憶裏，我的心便驟然變得年靑了。一寸山河一寸血334  葉勁風　　這就要回頭轉到諜探的定型出塲一項上了。這定型出塲，在總部的註册宗卷檔案上，必定有一個註脚，也必定有一個名目；這個名目必定要指定一個代名假借的定型；然而說明這名目，註脚的字句並不十分簡短。太簡短就容易發生含混毛病，如不簡短，在訓令秘碼上，就不能符合「肯定淸楚」這個條件了。　　鶴見可說是這件工作的專家，除了學問，還有多年的經騐，所以他才把這出塲的定型姿態，分門別類，規納成十五門部；一到八種爲一般社會出塲，九到十五爲軍事出塲定型；又把號碼勘定，第一號是什麽，應是什麽社會型，什麽暗號，什麽口令，什麽路綫，什麽姿態，什麼行動。所以在秘密訓令上，只需點明號碼，受　令的負責人，不問素日見過這人與否，一索便得，毫無差錯。一切報吿，記錄，也可化繁爲簡，便利之至。　　我這一次到天津去工作，唱這一　大軸戲，就是用的第「十五號」定型，也就是我的假姓「本職」－軍部情報特字間諜電訊高級秘書兼外勤幹員－同志來找我，依照這條路綫，一遞口令暗號，就可找到　　（據鶴見當日規定的辦法，其中還有綜合號碼和有機變化，這裏因興本文沒有重要關係，暫不說明）。　　當晚我用「十五號」姿態，與北平日方當局接洽之後，即動身趕到天津。W君的殘餘部下負責人，一位姓徐的，遵照W君佈置，在我抵達的半小時內，就跟我通了暗綫。　　我同徐君利用某種姿態，一度接觸細談之後，方才知道日方破獲駐津反諜站的因果，極其複雜。同志中除了受捕的數名之外，還有兩三名當塲犧牲了。至於耀羣和小老虎的實際情形，徐君因隔了手，並不淸楚；必得在已遭捕獲禁拘着的一羣中，找到一位丁君，（即津站正式負責人），才有確實報道。　　費了一日夜的麻煩，才在拘押所裏找到丁君。但丁君在衝突的時候，爭鬥激烈　，受了重傷，遭拘後，又經過僞警，倭憲　，及日特，三方面的非刑拷打敲間，支持不住，以致病了，體溫高到一百零三四度　。天氣如此之熱，日人把他拋在一個死囚牢的眾間內，斷絕水米。米倒無所謂，他根本吃不下去，只是滴永不能到口，才眞是致命的擺佈。經過這一擺佈，起先他還能直着勃子，嘶聲呌喊；等我尋到他的當口，已經燒得唇裂舌綻，雙睛赤紅，　語不絕，手足有些兒痙攣現象，隔時一陣抽搐。滬濱絮語迎日本軍艦  十郞　　日本賠償中國物資中的八艘軍艦，已於三日駛抵上海，六日上午並將舉行接收典禮　　日本軍艦對上海人的印象太深刻了。「八一三」之戰爆發不久，停泊”本領事館門前的旗艦「出雲號」，曾經遭遇我軍水雷襲擊，當時雖未將「出雲號」擊沉，但全上海盛傳「出雲艦」被襲沉沒的消息，會經予人莫大的感奮。　　又當時盛傳我會計劃封鎖長江以內的日本軍艦，假如當時計劃能够實現，抗戰初期的敵我態勢，一定有重大的改變。　　中國的陸軍以英勇善戰著名於世，所謂「草鞋兵」，到今尙燴炙海外。　　勝利以後，英美都陸續贈我軍艦，而昔日會對我作股的日本軍艦，今天高懸着紅藍兩色的賠償旗幟溫文爾雅的駛入吳淞口，這對於中國應當是極大的鼓勵。　　日本在盟軍管理下，正在埋頭復興，我們在接收日艦之餘，對於重建新海軍，更應揚鞭策進，使無海防，無國防的中國，能够從此揚眉吐氣！自由淡漢唐的善後救濟事業  湘若　　西人稱中國爲「災荒之國」，良以有史以來，書册所載的「亂離」，「災害」的材料，實佔有很大很重要的篇幅。　　試看西漢各代的災荒。每七年必有一次，漢高祖定鼎之初，開篇第一章，黄河流域京兆區的關中，就有：「漢二年，關中大肌，米斗五千，死者過半，高祖乃令民得賣子，就食蜀漢」，（前漢書食貨志及歷代通鑑輯覽卷十三）因爲戰後荒年災情的嚴重，令民賣去自己的骨肉逃荒，這不僅是頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的政策，而且是飮酖止渴的救濟方案。結果呢？骨肉流離，死亡載道，僥倖生存的，也變成少數富人的奴隸了：「臨邱多富人，卓王孫客僮八百人，程，鄭亦數百人。」（前漢書司馬相如傳）當時的官僚，更利用救濟的美名，從事於私人開財源的活動：「諸鐵官皆置吏卒徒，攻山取銅鐵，一歲功十萬人以上」。「諸宮奴婢十萬餘人」（前漢書列傅卷四二）到了元帝時，政府也　養奴婢，飽食終日，無所事事，並加重良民的負担，以供給道班奴隸：「官奴婢十萬餘，游戲無事，稅良民以給之」。（前漢書貢禹傳）。　　到了中古時代，因着佛敎在中國的流佈，災害的救濟工作，政府爲避免麻煩起見，多委之於僧侶，僧侶亦利用這個「普渡衆生」的機會來吸取沙門：「……乃大起浮圖，以銅爲人，黄金塗身，衣以錦采，童銅磐九重，下爲重樓閣道，可容三千餘人，悉讀佛經，令界內及郡人有好佛者，聽受道復其他役以招致之。由此遠近前後至者五千人戶。每浴佛，多設酒飯，布席於路，經數十里，人民來觀及就食且萬人，費以巨億計」。（三國志吳志劉　傳）這種救濟事業，規模的宏大，可見一斑。而且他們所救濟的對象，都是赤貧的大衆。「……釋僧詮精練三藏，化洽江南。性好擅施，周瞻貧乏，居年縑幣。屢造金像，禪禮無輟」。（釋氏通鑑卷四）這種自奉甚薄，舍已從人的救濟精神，實足以做目前善後救濟事業的楷模。他們的救濟經費，一方面是廟寺產業的收入，一方面是政府的給予。如石虎之給釋道開，宋太宗之給釋道猛，都是用爲救濟事業的經費，有不足者，更如史宗賣唱以補助之。（高僧傳初集卷十一）救濟的物品，不但是義生的酒飯，粟米，錦帛，錢帛，而且包括醫藥，這種利人的精神，也是實在可佩的，他們的工作不但能深入，而且能普遍，技術的高明，尤雜想像。　　「修就沙門憎　，硏習衆方，略盡其術，針灸授　，莫不有效。徐兗之間，多所救恤，四方疾若。不千　，竟往衆之，　諸藥方百餘卷，皆行於世」（魏書李修傳）並且能治人不治之症。「時有痼疾，世莫能治者，澄爲醫療，應時瘳損，陰加默益者，不可勝計。」（高僧傳初集卷一〇）並且分傷寒，眼科，皮膚科，傳染病，產科，瘋疾等等之分，眞所謂應有盡有了。可是佛寺到了元代，他藉用蒙古的政治力量，不談救濟而講發財了。　　唐代雖三申五令，不准額外苛徵雜稅，以救濟農民，如唐會要卷八四：「如聞近年畏吏不收法制，分外征求，致使力農之夫轉加困弊，亦有每年差官巡檢勞擾頗深。如聞近日或有於虛估匹段數內征實估物及其間分數，亦不盡依勅條，宜委長切加遵守，如有違越必議科繩。」但言者諄諄，「聽者藐藐，難怪老杜杜陵叟有「虛受吾皇鑼免恩」的怨聲了　　前事不忘，後事之師，這些漢唐的善後救濟事業來，有的固可作他山之石藉資攻錯；有的也可爲前車之鑑、以兔重蹈。梅雨  柳惲　　日來氣候，已入梅雨季節。室內外潮濕悶熱，極爲難受。川滇間十載奔波，幾乎使我忘記江南初夏是有「黄梅天」的了，一旦歸來，身受此味，覺得比重慶霧季的陰霾味兒更不好受。想起周淸眞詞「地卑山近，衣潤費爐烟」一語，眞能寫出「雨肥梅子」時江南家居的感覺。　　梅雨之說不一，大抵是因地域氣候不同而異；埤雅載有：「江湘二浙，四五月之間，梅欲黄落，則水潤土灣，礎壁皆汗，蒸鬱成雨，其霏如霧，謂之梅雨，霑衣服，皆敗。「又明郞瑛七修頭稿碎金集云：「芒種後逢壬入梅，夏至後逢庚出梅。」所說是指江南的梅雨，時在春夏之交。歲時　要云：「閩人以立夏　逢庚入梅，芒種後過壬爲出梅·」則知南粤梅雨，時在暮春三月，比長江流域的要早一個月·至於四川的梅雨，其溽悶不若江南，爲時亦較短暫。所以川人未嘗以梅雨爲苦。杜詩：「南京犀浦道，四月熟黄梅，湛湛長江去，溟溟細雨來。」唐代的南京，即今之成都，梅雨是四月，期與江左略同。筆者在渝時！曾作有點絳唇詞：「費盡楊絲，依前難綰芳春住，濃情團絮，舞遍天涯路。春有歸時，人有歸時否？天無語，梅黄如許，依樣江南雨。」雖然憾其「依樣作雨」，尙未遽以爲苦也。　　地愈趨南，梅雨就愈平：南洋正二月間即有梅雨，可以爲證　　或謂梅雨嘗作霉雨，張　溪：一霉，雨中暑氣也。霉雨汚衣，故日霉污。」或謂梅嘗作盡，說文，「徽，物中久雨靑黑也，」我覺得皆不如梅雨，以梅雨二字天然有風韵，以之入詩甚妙·唐太宗詩：「和風吹綠野，梅雨　芳田·」韓偓詩：「三一春日日黄梅雨，孤客年：靑草湖，「韓翃詩：「荷香隨去棹，梅雨點行衣。」均楚楚有致。　　舊詩有「黄梅時節家家雨·」之句，又有「梅子黄時日日晴」，是家戶喩曉的。試問梅子黄時究竟有雨無雨呢？試爲答曰：「熟梅天氣半陰晴。」旅美什錦  徐園　　此間無枇杷，端午不過節　　在美國住久了，才發現中國眞的地大物傳，僅就水菓一項生產而言，美國所有的，中國都有，中國所有的，美國不一定有。美國沒有枇杷，沒有荔支，美國的楊梅，酸不可當，美國的柚子Grapefruil，澀不堪言，川湘所產的凉薯，也不是美國所有的，錦橘雖移植來美，僅可點綴，無法應市。他們沒有柿子，把番茄當柿子吃，橄欖小得像蓮心，他們很少荷花，根本不知道吃運子，菱角也不是美國人所可享受，甘蔗成爲罕有之品。因爲沒有枇杷，我們衹好不慶祝端午。美國人鋻於水菓品類的單調，終年橘子蘋菓，蘋菓橘子，却想出許多人造飲料，什麽Coca　cola,Pepsi　Cola　7upRoot　been　Lemonade,　Orange　Juice　還有千奇百怪的名稱，實在記不了許多，吃來吃去，味道一樣，少吃有滋味，多吃一肚皮氣（蘇打作用也），總沒有含櫻桃，剝鮮荔來得有趣。池塘採　，也成爲農村姑娘的一種樂事。把鮮紅的櫻桃送進女人的小嘴·比好萊塢銀幕上的狂吻擁抱要雅致得多，水料可以增進人生的趣味的。（十）（一）甲申之變  季明　　北京城破之先一日，毅宗倉促設朝，問計羣臣，羣臣俯首不能對，毅宗數曰：「君非亡國之君，臣乃亡國之臣。」因慨然而退。翌日，城陷，毅宗聚后妃眷屬，令自裁，皇后自　宮女投御河而死者數百人，胭脂漲膩，水爲之塞，事見費宮人傳。帝復召長公主，手刃之，斷右臂，曰：「若何不幸生我家」！旋聞李自成已破承天門，遂倉皇自縊於煤山·此甲由亡國實况也。吾人讀史至此·每爲之鳴咽墮淚，以專制一時之帝王，其下塲亦不兔如此，此眞可謂作法自斃矣。黄梨洲原君曰：「以天下爲一人之私產，則人之欲得之心，誰不如我」，一語道破古今帝制之弊。今日雖無君主制度，然納粹，法西斯，實其變相也，故希特勒不兔自焚，墨索里尼不兔槍決，當後等臨終之日，其亦悟及專制之書否？米蓋羅尼在「玉女神駒」中科學小品蛺蝶  賈祖璋　　現在一般的動物學書裏，把峽蝶這個各稱，　指包括豹蝶等等那一科中形的蝶類。這一科蝶類，翅色大都橙黄，邊緣常有缺刻；幼虫生有毒分支的刺毛，具有鮮艷的紅色黄色等警戒色，多甯食柳樹，楊樹，苧麻等植物的紫子。　　依據我國舊時的記載，蛺蝶是蝶類的一個總名，與蝴蝶或蝶意義相同。如埤雅云：「蛺蝶粉翅有　，一名蝴蝶。」本草綱口云：「蛺蝶輕薄，夾翅而飛，栩栩然也。蝶美於　，蛾美於眉，故又名蝴蝶，俗謂鬚爲胡也。」　　北戶錄酉陽雜俎兩書，便其體地列舉多種蝶的名稱，隸屬於蛺蝶之下。北戶錄用蛺蝶枝三字做題目，有如下的記錄：「公路南行，歷懸藤蛺，維舟飲水，覩墨側有一木五踩，初謂丹靑之樹，因命僮僕采之。頃獲一枝，尙綴軟蝶，凡二十餘個：有翠紺縷者，金眼者，丁香眼者，紫裏眼者，黑花眼者，黄白者，緋脈者，大如蝙蝠者，小如楡莢者。」酉陽雜俎則云：「一日，紫極宮會秀才劉魯封，云：『嘗見滕工蛺蝶圖，有名江夏斑，大海限，小海眼，村裏來，菜花子。」」揣摩這兩則文字的意義，現在所說的鳳蝶，豹蝶，蛇目蝶，黄蝶，粉蝶，小灰蝶都包括在蛺蝶這個名詞之中了。又如古今注云：「蛺蝶一名野蛾，一名風蝶，江東呼爲撻末（爾雅翼引作　末），色白背靑者是也。」似乎專指粉蝶，其實是並不細辦種類，衹是蝶的泛稱。　　從文學作品中考察起米，也可以證明蛺蝶衹是蝶的泛稱：　　「空園暮　起，消遣獨未歸，翠　藏高柳，紅蓮拂水衣，　比從風蝶，雙雙花上飛，寄語相知者，同心終莫·」（梁簡文帝：詠峽蝶）　　「靑陵台畔日光斜，萬古貞魂倚暮霞，莫許韓憑爲蛺蝶，等閑飛上別技花。」（唐李商　：靑陵姦）　　文字的意義，往往隨了時代而變化。古人見到蛺蝶兩字，便浮現出一個多種蝴蝶的　的印象，　代　過動物學書的人，見到蛺蝶兩字、却　有　　中的一種　一科的印象了。</p>

<h3>Suppressing Internal Disorder and Consolidating Unity: Implementing the National Reconstruction Policy Through Peace - State Council Passes General Mobilization Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The "Vigorously Implement National General Mobilization" proposal submitted by Chairman Chiang and agreed upon by both the Party and the government, was passed at the sixth State Council meeting held on the morning of the 4th at 9:00 AM. Before the discussion, Chairman Chiang first explained the significance of the proposal, emphasizing the necessity of vigorously implementing national general mobilization and suppressing the communist bandits to realize constitutional government. Committee Member Zou Lu then spoke, stating that the general mobilization was indeed necessary. Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party, Ji Yiqiao of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Wang Chonghui and Weng Wenhao also spoke separately. Yu Jiaju expressed support for the proposal, but emphasized the need to ensure that strengthening the suppression of communist military forces does not lead to the neglect of safeguarding the basic rights of the people. Ji Yiqiao stated that after expressing his agreement to the proposal, a peaceful resolution with the Communist Party was no longer possible, and therefore, only force remained. However, if the military suppression of the communists is to be implemented thoroughly, attention must be paid to the separation of military and civil governance, strengthening the powers of provincial and county administrative officials, separating central and local powers, establishing local armed forces, and reforming local politics, so that these measures can coordinate with the military and eliminate the communist forces. Subsequently, Chen Bulei and six others were nominated to revise the text. The committee members then took a break for more than twenty minutes before reconvening, and the proposal was then read out and passed. The Chairman expressed satisfaction with the revisions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The National Government Committee held its sixth State Council meeting in the National Government meeting hall at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 4th. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting, and committee members Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Chen Bulei, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Mo Dehui, Chen Huide, and Wang Yunwu, totaling twenty-two people, were present. Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Li Wenfan, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Zhou Zhongyue, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Huang Shaohong, Vice President of the Control Yuan, Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, Zhang Lisheng, Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the General Election Office, Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance, Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary, Xue Yue, Chief of Staff, and Xu Kan, Director-General of Budget, were all in attendance. The meeting began with the reading of four items on the agenda: (1) The list of candidates for the committee members of the various State Council sub-committees for review; (2) The list of supplementary candidates for the National Government Political Officials Disciplinary Committee; (3) The Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty; and (4) The Sino-Saudi Friendship Treaty. Next, Committee Member and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie and Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi reported on the latest diplomatic and military situation, respectively. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) In order to save the people in the bandit-controlled areas, safeguard national survival, and consolidate national unity, a national general mobilization should be vigorously implemented to suppress the communist bandit rebellion, remove obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government as scheduled, and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace. The resolution was passed (the full text of the proposal can be found in another article). (2) The number of Legislative Yuan legislators elected by professional groups should be eighty-four.

<h3>Implementation Measures to be Drafted Separately</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] After the National General Mobilization proposal was passed by the State Council, its implementation has been entrusted to the Executive Yuan and relevant departments to jointly draft concrete measures. It is understood that new measures will be taken in various relevant sectors, including the economy, politics, military, food, and society. The economic reform plan will also undergo some changes. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has decided to have Wang Yunwu be responsible for convening relevant personnel to jointly draft measures. It is reported that the Ministers of Finance, Economy, Food, Agriculture, and Interior are all ex officio members. These measures will be drafted and promulgated. Furthermore, the spirit of this proposal lies in: (1) strengthening conscription; (2) strengthening grain requisition; and (3) increasing national treasury revenue. The financial and food departments will enter a wartime system.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The National Government held its sixth State Council meeting today and passed a proposal to vigorously implement national general mobilization. The National Government has ordered the Executive Yuan to forward it to the relevant departments for compliance and implementation, and has also distributed it to the Legislative Yuan and other agencies directly under the National Government for their information. The instructions to the Executive Yuan are recorded as follows: "On July 4 of this year, the sixth State Council meeting of the Government Committee passed a resolution to save the people in the bandit-controlled areas, safeguard national survival, consolidate national unity, vigorously implement national general mobilization, suppress the communist bandit rebellion, remove obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government as scheduled, and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace. This resolution should be earnestly implemented. In addition to issuing separate orders, the original proposal is hereby copied and sent to you for compliance and for forwarding to the relevant departments for handling. This order."</p>
<h3>Full Text of the General Mobilization Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] At the State Council meeting of the National Government Committee on the 4th, a proposal submitted by the Chairman to realize constitutional government as scheduled and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace was passed. The original proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In order to save the people in the bandit-controlled areas, safeguard national survival, and consolidate national unity, it is proposed to vigorously implement national general mobilization to suppress the communist bandit rebellion, remove obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government as scheduled, and implement the national reconstruction policy through peace.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the government has been actively carrying out demobilization in order to engage in reconstruction and allow the people to rest and recuperate. Although all measures have not been as satisfactory as expected, it has always adhered to the principle of political solutions for the actions of the Chinese Communist Party in possessing troops, occupying territory, disrupting local areas, and rebelling against the country by force. It has spared no effort to compromise and tolerate in order to achieve this goal. However, since October of last year, the Communist Party has first refused to comply with the government's cease-fire order, then refused to participate in the National Assembly, and then refused the government's proposal to send representatives to Yan'an to discuss peace. Most recently, its propaganda organs have resolutely rejected the peace proposals of the National Political Council. While the government is striving to reorganize its army, the Communist Party is coercing the masses and expanding its rebellious military force on a large scale. While the government is striving for demobilization and reconstruction, the communist bandits are obstructing the progress of demobilization everywhere and destroying our transportation, industry, and mining construction everywhere. While the government is striving to realize democratic politics and preparing for constitutional work, the communist bandits are preaching democracy on one hand and cruelly abusing the people on the other, using every means possible. In recent months, the communist bandits have launched large-scale offensives against our national army in North China and Northeast China, hindering the government's complete takeover of territorial sovereignty. Their determination to overthrow the country by force is extremely obvious, and their acts of inciting social unrest and disrupting public order are also becoming increasingly clear. The communist bandits have openly launched a full-scale armed rebellion and have isolated themselves from the people of the country. They have long regarded themselves as an armed rebellious group and have excluded themselves from the ranks of political parties, not hesitating to be enemies of the country and the nation. Their obstinacy and failure to come to their senses have reached this point, so the government's national policy of peaceful reconstruction cannot be resolved through political means. In particular, our compatriots in the northern regions ravaged by the communist bandits and in areas close to the bandit-controlled areas are suffering more and more every day. The government cannot continue to delay and sit idly by. Furthermore, our compatriots across the country want to live and work in peace and contentment, and it is not enough to defend the foundation of the country and the safety of all the people without eliminating this greatest obstacle to reconstruction and national rejuvenation with all our strength. Moreover, the government has the responsibility to consolidate national unity and safeguard national survival. If the rebellion is not suppressed as soon as possible, not only will constitutional government and democracy not be realized, but the unity and security of the country will also lose their guarantee. Therefore, the government's determination to suppress the rebellion is a last resort. It is necessary for the military and civilians across the country to concentrate their will, mobilize national strength, and on one hand, step up the suppression of the rebellion and actively engage in construction in order to remove the obstacles to democratic constitutional government and achieve the goal of peaceful national reconstruction. Based on this purpose, it is proposed that the State Council decide to implement national general mobilization, call on the whole nation to rise up together and strive forward. All matters, including strengthening economic construction, revitalizing local politics, mobilizing manpower and material resources, improving the grain and corvée systems, maintaining social security, relieving the suffering of the people, safeguarding the basic rights of the people, vigorously implementing consumption savings, increasing agricultural and industrial production, and improving the treatment of officers and soldiers, should be handed over to the relevant departments to properly formulate plans, enact laws, and implement them in accordance with the law. As for how to prevent disturbances outside the law during the implementation, the relevant departments should be strictly instructed to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>State Council Discusses Relevant Election Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The State Council discussed the proposal submitted by the Chairman regarding "whether the implementation date of the National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Legislators Election and Recall Law should be calculated from the date when all the attached tables are announced, as requested by the General Election Office, or how it should be stipulated." This sparked a debate. The case was submitted by the Election Office, stating that although the implementing regulations and distribution tables for the election and recall of National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Legislators will be announced successively, the attached table for the distribution of the number of National Assembly Representatives and the distribution table for the number of Legislators from professional groups have not yet been announced. Before these attached tables are announced in full, the election work cannot be advanced, and the election procedures cannot be determined. It is necessary to wait until all the attached tables are announced before implementation can begin. However, the procedures for the preparation for the implementation of the Constitution stipulate that it must be completed within six months after the promulgation of the election law, and the deadline is extremely urgent. The office had resolved that the implementation date of the election law should be calculated from the date when all the attached tables are announced. During the discussion, some argued that the date should still be calculated from the date of promulgation of the Election and Recall Law and its implementing regulations, while others advocated following the Election Office's proposal. After a lengthy discussion, it was finally decided to hand it over to the Legal System Review Committee for review before submitting it to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] National Government order: (1) The table of distribution of the number of representatives of professional groups in the National Assembly is hereby promulgated. This order. (2) Article 12 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law is hereby amended and promulgated. This order. (3) Article 12 of the Legislative Yuan Legislator Election and Recall Law is hereby amended and promulgated. This order. (4) The division of electoral districts for Legislative Yuan legislators residing abroad and the table of distribution of the number of legislators to be elected from each district are hereby promulgated. This order.</p>

<h3>Soviet News Agency Fabricates Rumors</h3>
<p>Falsely Accuses the US of Jointly Establishing a Secret Service Agency</p>
<p>Relevant Parties State that There is No Such Thing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Soviet Union's News Agency reported on June 22 that "China and the United States intend to establish a joint secret service agency in Shanghai to prevent the illegal sale of drugs, with representatives from the United Nations participating," and stated that "the tasks are difficult to understand." The reporter inquired about this matter with relevant parties and learned that in March of this year, the United States suggested that China and the United States sign an informal bilateral agreement to exchange reports on anti-narcotics smuggling and information on suspected smugglers in order to effectively promote detection and anti-smoking work. Our side agreed to this suggestion and established the "Measures for the Exchange of International Anti-Narcotics Smuggling Information" by the Executive Yuan on May 23. The so-called "establishment of a joint China-US secret service agency in Shanghai" reported by the News Agency is completely unfounded. The United States has signed similar agreements with 22 other countries.</p>

More than 20 people spoke out to denounce Miao. When General Wei Lihuang visited Berlin, the overseas Chinese had presented Miao's misdeeds to Wei in person. Patriotic overseas Chinese here unanimously requested the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately dismiss Miao and, in addition to reminiscing about the good governance of the former head of the delegation, Gui Shuiqing, they hoped that the new head of the delegation, General Huang Qixiang, would assume office as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Police Security Department Plans to Suppress Bandits in the Territory</h3>

In addition to reporting on the department's tasks and organization, he stated that the bandits in the province currently have political backgrounds. The bandits in Dongjiang and Beijiang can only cause disturbances and have no other effect. The bandits in the Nanlu-Qiongya area are more active and may expand outwards. However, from the current perspective, the bandit problem is not very serious. Now that the department has been established, there will be strict plans to suppress them separately, and it is believed that eradication will not be difficult.</p>

<h3>Situation on the Northern Section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway is Stable; National Army Crosses Gu City to the South; Fierce Battle for the Defense of Xin City is Underway</h3>

<p>[Our Baoding Office, 4th] The war on the Beiping-Hankou Line has entered a decisive stage. The National Army has crossed Gu City to advance south. It has been confirmed that the communist army around Baoding is moving more frequently, and most of them have moved to the railway side between Xushui and Gu City. The two armies are preparing for a main battle. The meeting of the National Army from the north and south will depend on the recovery of Xushui. The remaining communists around Gu City have been cleared. The communist army attacked the outskirts of Baoding again last night and retreated on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 4th] The National Army won a great victory in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway. In the battles of Beihedian and Liujiazhuang, the communist army's 6th and 7th Brigades were defeated, and another 20 regiments were completely annihilated.</p>

<h3>Implement National Mobilization to the Fullest Extent, Enabling the People to Discern Right from Wrong, Change Essential to Express Opinions on the Mobilization Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Vice Chairman Sun spoke on the 4th, regarding the "Implement National Mobilization to the Fullest Extent" plan passed by the State Council, stating that the Communist Party has launched a full-scale rebellion, threatening the nation's survival. The government, in order to comprehensively respond, has passed this critical plan based on the National Mobilization Law. This decision does not greatly differ from the punitive expedition order, the difference being that the punitive expedition order was specifically against the Communist Party, while this decision mobilizes the internal government. After this plan is passed, it will be handed over to the Executive Yuan to draft a plan and promulgate laws to implement it. The reporter also interviewed government and Youth Party figures on the 4th, inquiring about their opinions on the national mobilization plan.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu Dingchang stated: The Communist Party has occupied territory with armed forces and disrupted local areas for a long time. The government should clarify the facts to enable the people of the country to understand the truth. The mobilization work will be assigned to the relevant authorities to carefully draft measures and implement them. The military action against the Communists is not intended as a punitive expedition, but as a strengthening of existing efforts.</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Ji stated that the National Mobilization plan is essentially equivalent to a punitive expedition order and strengthens the military's efforts to suppress the Communists. This is a rare occurrence in the past decade. Since the War of Resistance, it began with joint operations, then participation in party negotiations after victory, until last year when the Chinese Communist Party abandoned peace, disturbed local areas, and the government, under much tolerance, was forced to respond. Until now, friend and foe are indistinguishable. Therefore, the passage of this plan should demonstrate to our compatriots nationwide to discern right from wrong, which is essential. Zhang believes that if national mobilization is implemented properly and military strength is enhanced, the Communist forces can be wiped out within a year.</p>
<p>When asked about the military aspects of the national mobilization, Minister Bai only replied that reporters should inquire with Chief of Staff Chen. The Ministry of National Defense is an implementing agency and will follow government orders. There are no plans within the Ministry regarding a timeframe for eliminating the Communist forces.</p>
<p>Regarding a timeframe for eliminating the Communist forces, Chen Cheng stated: "I am not a fortune teller; I cannot predict when this goal can be achieved."</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Chen Lifu stated: "We should concentrate all manpower and resources to expedite the suppression of the rebellion and actively build. Regarding the Communist forces, even in the United States, those disloyal to the country have the right to be disciplined. Moreover, the Communist Party occupies territory with armed forces, disrupts local areas, and undermines the Constitution, so they should be disciplined."</p>
<p>After the Political Situation is Clarified, Many Communist Soldiers Will Defect</p>
<p>For the past year, it has been both fighting and talking, making it difficult for the people to distinguish whether it is suppression or reconciliation.</p>
<p>This has had a major impact on the morale of the troops at the front. Moreover, Communist soldiers who want to defect are afraid that if peace talks succeed, they will be harmed by the Communist Party, so they dare not come. Therefore, after this measure is announced, the political situation will be clarified, and many Communist soldiers will defect. The defeat will be like a mountain collapsing. Imagining some time in the future, the Communist forces should be quelled, and victory may be obtained in the short term. However, we should not underestimate the Communist Party excessively.</p>
<p>Chen Qitian of the Youth Party expressed no objection to the national mobilization plan, stating that he agreed with this necessary measure by the government. Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party stated: "Now that this plan has been passed, it must be implemented effectively in the future. We agree with this proposal."</p>
<p>Shanghai Figures Value Government Decisions on the Current Situation</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, after the State Council passed the proposal on the current situation, all sectors of the city paid close attention. However, they were unwilling to comment much because they had not seen the full text of the proposal. The reporter interviewed celebrities from all walks of life yesterday to explore their feelings on this measure:</p>
<p>Xu Jiguang, Vice Chairman of the Senate, stated: The reason why the government does not formally issue a punitive expedition order is to respect the opinions of friendly parties, but in fact, this action is no different from a punitive expedition. Since the government is determined to mobilize the people and resources of the country to shorten the internal turmoil, it is expected that the military conflict in the country will not be prolonged for too long.</p>
<p>Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, stated: The government's failure to issue a punitive expedition order leaves room for the situation. In fact, since mobilization has been approved, a punitive expedition order is unnecessary. This move has a milder posture internationally, which also has a good impact. As for seeking to quell the internal turmoil within a certain period, it is a difficult task. The current key task is how to stabilize people's hearts. In particular, young intellectuals should have the opportunity to serve the country and society. At present, there are university students who are willing to go to factories to become workers, which is an abnormal phenomenon. The current economic situation should be improved, but the relevant factors are too complicated and implementation is very difficult.</p>
<p>Famous lawyer Chen Tingrui stated: There is essentially no difference between issuing a punitive expedition order to the Communist Party or not. After mobilization is implemented, it has the effect of rectifying names. The conflicts in the government's policies in the past have now been completely eliminated, which should boost morale and increase combat power. As far as the international impact of this move is concerned, the international community has already taken clear sides, so there is no need to be obviously wary. In the future, the government should seek its own strength and vigorously implement the rule of law from top to bottom in order to seek political reform.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Reports on Military Affairs in the Northeast and Shandong Provinces</h3>

<p>At today's Legislative Yuan meeting, the National Assembly Women's Representative Quota Allocation Table was discussed first. Because the case had been discussed on the 3rd, there was no major debate at the meeting. The only dispute was the issue of branches of national women's groups. The result was still to maintain the original proposal, that is, national women's groups are limited to those with more than five branches in each province and city, and whose membership lists have been registered with the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>
<p>Another election-related case was the "Draft Punishment Regulations for Obstructing Elections." The case was also discussed at the 329th regular meeting. At that time, it was decided to re-submit for review because the content still had areas worth discussing.</p>
<p>After the case was raised, Luo Dingyu first explained it, and then the debate began. Situ De and Cheng Yuanzhen believed that it was unnecessary. Situ De pointed out that many of the provisions in the regulations could not be implemented, and many of them were already stipulated in the Criminal Law. For example, prohibiting "openly entertaining with banquets or providing food, accommodation, and transportation" may be too unreasonable. Cheng Yuanzhen believed that election bribery was an educational and economic problem, and could not be prevented by law. Although the original intention of the regulations was to protect the poor, the result might be to protect bad people. Chen Ruxuan and others held different views, believing that having a law was better than having no law. Election bribery is inevitable even in advanced democratic countries, and the fact that it cannot be prevented does not mean that there is no need for a separate law. This country is implementing elections for the first time, and regulations are necessary, otherwise elections will become a kind of gambling behavior, and those with two tons of banknotes can overwhelm those with one ton of banknotes. Lü Fu cited the story of election bribery in the early Republic of China, and strongly advocated that there must be a separate law to prevent bribery, otherwise those with special power can do whatever they want, and the weak will never have the right to sue. Jian Guan 3, the original proposer, also believed that the purpose of this move was mainly to give those in power a certain recognition. They believed that this case was important and that it was necessary to review it comprehensively, and suggested re-submitting it for review. Finally, Concurrently President Sun stood up and spoke, pointing out that the main targets for preventing election bribery are three: (1) Local administrative officials who abuse their power, (2) Armed classes who influence elections, (3) Local political groups who use group power to threaten people inside and outside the group. The draft regulations do not prevent any of the above three, and seem to be missing something. Since the draft is not sufficient and rigorous, it seems appropriate to put this case aside for the time being and review it after the adjournment. Decision: Review after the meeting reconvenes.</p>
<h3>In Case of Emergency During the Adjournment, Temporary Meetings May Be Convened, Ordinary Cases Can Be Handled First and Then Complete the Procedures</h3>
<p>The temporary motion of fifty legislators, including legislator Liu Guanxun, proposed that from the 5th to August 31st, the Legislative Yuan be discussed at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan. Concurrently President Sun first reported on the situation of the State Council meeting on the morning of the 4th. It was said that President Zhang mentioned at the meeting that during the Legislative Yuan's two-month adjournment in July and August, what would happen if the government had more important plans that needed to complete the legislative process! Everyone at the meeting believed that important military measures could not be delayed for a long time due to the Legislative Yuan's adjournment. Other cases could be handled according to the past precedent of the National Defense Committee era, first handled and then supplemented with procedures. Sun continued, during the adjournment of this court, if an emergency occurs that requires a meeting, a temporary meeting can be convened. Legislators from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places can easily come to the meeting. Sun Jiulu and others also pointed out that according to the Legislative Yuan's organizational law, if one-third of the legislators are present, it is a legal quorum. At present, transportation is convenient, and airplanes arrive in the evening after departing in the morning. If they can contact each other properly, it will not be difficult to attend a temporary meeting. Finally, it was decided to adjourn from the 5th and reconvene in early September. According to the Legislative Yuan, since last autumn, the most important work in more than ten months has been to formulate the constitutional draft and various constitutional laws and regulations. As of today, six organizational laws, four election and recall laws, and election and recall implementation regulations have been completed. The National Assembly representatives and legislative members' various quota allocation tables have also been drafted. Former President of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen and current President Zhang Qun, and others, have come to the court to explain their administrative policies, which have not only made great contributions to the formulation of constitutional laws and regulations, but also made many contributions to the implementation of democratic constitutionalism. At the end of the adjournment, each legislator will go to various places to investigate constitutionalism, and after the autumn, when they come back, they will definitely make new contributions to constitutionalism.</p>

<h3>The Initial Consequences of Tolerating Japan! A Japanese Member's Absurd Suggestion: "Manchuria" and Taiwan Should Hold Referendums</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] It has been learned that Osaki Yukio, a 90-year-old Japanese member, submitted a draft resolution on the future peace treaty to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the 4th, requesting that it be submitted to the Diet. Osaki suggested that a referendum should be held in the future to determine the future status of "Manchuria," Taiwan, Ryukyu, and Korea. Osaki's draft peace treaty resolution has the following three points: (1) "Manchuria," Taiwan, and Ryukyu should be placed under the supervision of the United Nations. When public peace is restored, a referendum should be held to determine whether the people there wish to be independent or to be affiliated to which country. (2) The issue of compensation should be based on the losses suffered by both parties, and the compensation should be paid to the party that suffered the most losses. (3) If the victorious country ignores this reasonable opinion when resolving the compensation issue, Japan should oppose its request by not cooperating.</p>
<h3>Dreaming of Refusing Compensation Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] Osaki Yukio told Associated Press reporters today that he intends to submit a bill to the House of Representatives requesting that he refuse to bear full compensation responsibility for the Pacific War and ask the United Nations to take over most of Japan's wartime territory. The concept of "the strong and weak" must be eliminated from past treaties in order to achieve reconciliation with Japan, otherwise "the Third World War is inevitable," and newly invented weapons will lead to the demise of mankind. The losses suffered by the winning and losing countries should be fairly calculated, and "countries with the heaviest losses should be compensated by those with lighter losses." If the winning country ignores this reasonable calculation and demands compensation from Japan, then we "should refuse it by relying on selection and statistics and refuse to cooperate in collecting compensation."</p>

<h3>Modern Robinson Crusoe Story: Our Sailors Survive an Adventure; Honored by the British for Wartime Service with a Medal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mr. Aukenden, the British Consul General in Shanghai, awarded a British Empire Medal (O.B.E.) to Mr. Shen Zuting, a Chinese engineer, at the consulate at 4:00 PM yesterday to commend his heroic achievements during the war. The ceremony was quite grand, with the participation of Mr. Chen Guofu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Evans, British Shipping Counselor in China, Mr. Balot, Naval Staff Officer in Shanghai, Mr. Brown, Assistant Naval Staff Officer, Mr. Miller, Assistant Military Attaché, and many friends of Mr. Shen. During the war, Mr. Shen served in the British Merchant Navy. On August 10, 1943, he served as the chief engineer of the "Light Valley" vessel, ordered to go to East Africa to provide military supplies. On the evening of the 13th, the ship was unfortunately attacked by a German submarine and quickly sank, with the captain killed in action. Mr. Shen led the 39 remaining survivors of the ship to drift at sea until dawn, when they found a lifeboat. The food was only enough to last for three days. Fortunately, on the third day, they discovered a small island in front of them, which they reached after the sailors worked hard to advance. However, the island was a deserted island, and Mr. Shen and others began a Robinson Crusoe-like drifting life, searching for mountain goats and eggs for food, building huts to live in, and Mr. Shen designed to convert the lifeboat's steam barrel into a distiller to turn seawater into drinking water. In this way, they managed to survive for as many as eighty days. On October 25, the watchmen discovered a reconnaissance plane in the distant sky, and they burned several bundles of raw rubber that they had found, with black smoke rising into the sky as a signal. Finally, the plane discovered them and dropped food and drink. On October 28, the British escort fleet received the news, sailed near the island, rescued all the sailors and took them aboard the ship, landing in East Africa and repatriating them to India in batches.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Re-implementation of a State of Total Mobilization</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the State Council approved an important proposal related to the current situation submitted by Chairman Chiang. According to news reports, the document is more than 2,000 words long. The proposal states: "In order to save the people in the bandit areas, ensure national survival, consolidate national unity, and request the vigorous implementation of national total mobilization to quell the rebellion of the communist bandits, eliminate obstacles to democracy, realize constitutional government on schedule, and implement the peaceful nation-building plan." As of the time of writing, we have not yet read the full text of this historically significant proclamation. Therefore, we cannot comment on the meaning of this proclamation. However, in the past week, domestic newspapers have all reported that the central government will have important resolutions: the people of the whole country are always hoping that the highest decision-making body of the central government can clarify the chaotic domestic situation as soon as possible; therefore, they have been hoping for an early decision by the State Council for some time. The decision passed by the State Council yesterday was not the punitive order expected by the public, but only a proclamation, which may disappoint some people; but we believe that this is a timely measure. The communist party's rampant lawlessness should have been ordered to be punished, to correct public opinion; we have said this again and again. However, in view of the fact that the Supreme Court has recently issued an arrest warrant for Mao Zedong, which legally recognizes Mao Zedong as a traitor, with this move, it is really meaningless for our government to issue a punitive order; moreover, it gives them importance, and from a wise perspective, it is not a wise thing.</p>
<p>However, although the State Council did not decide to issue a punitive order yesterday, it has placed the whole country back under a wartime system. The implementation of total mobilization has changed the whole country from peacetime to wartime. After a long period of resistance against Japan, the Chinese people finally survived until the victory of the War of Resistance; unexpectedly, soon after the victory, the whole country will return to a wartime system. Regarding yesterday's decision by the State Council, while the people of the whole country know that the unrest of the Chinese Communist Party cannot be resolved without intensifying military measures, they always hope that the war will not escalate. Now this hope has been shattered. The Chinese Communist Party relies on force, and we must defeat it with force. Under these circumstances, there are two points that must be stated:</p>
<p>(1) From a negative perspective, the Chinese Communist Party not only seizes territory and arms itself to rebel, but also colludes with foreign forces. This behavior violates the provisions of the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China" and should be punished according to national law to correct people's hearts. It is a pity that the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China" was abolished with the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. What is regrettable is that the crime of endangering the Republic of China cannot be avoided because of the abolition of this law. The Communist Party certainly endangers the Republic of China, and others who sympathize with the Communist Party and have actions also endanger the Republic of China; therefore, what we want to propose at this time is that, in view of the decision of the State Council, we hope that the government can re-announce the continued validity of the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China." The harm of the Chinese Communist Party to the Republic of China is not limited to the war zone, and the rear is not immune. We are not surprised to put China back in a state of war, but we hope that the rear and the war zone are equally important, and the mobilization order and the law on endangering the Republic of China are equally valued; therefore, after total mobilization, we hope that the "Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China" can be re-implemented.</p>
<p>(2) From a positive perspective, there are various objective reasons for the rampant behavior of the Chinese Communist Party. To eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, it is better to start from politics than from military affairs. Politics and military affairs are inseparable. If our politics are enlightened, what excuse can the Chinese Communist Party have? Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with quelling the Chinese Communist Party; we must improve politics so that the people can know where to go. Moreover, in the point of improving politics, we cannot only use democracy as a slogan; democracy without people's livelihood as its foundation is also futile. The only task of the government today is to stabilize people's livelihood; only when people's livelihood is stable can there be democracy, which is the third point we should recognize.</p>
<h3>From Price Negotiations to the Resumption of Cultivation Movement</h3>
<p>The main causes of price fluctuations are nothing more than two: the quantity of goods and the quantity of currency. Therefore, to regulate prices, stabilize prices, or suppress prices, only by starting from these two places can we find a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Because in the past, most of the methods were trivial and palliative in nature; they failed to promote the above two methods in a practical, systematic, and large-scale manner. Therefore, the more prices were stabilized, the more they fluctuated, and the more they were suppressed, the more they rose. Now, due to various relationships, although some people still advocate replaying the old tune, hoping to use extraordinary and simple means to suppress the rising prices, most people inevitably have some doubts about these means, and they can only hope for currency and production.</p>
<p>This article does not discuss the reorganization of the currency system and the consolidation of currency value, but focuses on production. That is to say, how to increase the quantity of production so that supply can gradually meet demand to stabilize or lower its prices.</p>
<p>In terms of production, it can be divided into two major parts: 1. Handicrafts, 2. Agricultural products. At present, it is particularly important to strive to increase agricultural products. The reason is very simple: most of the people in our country are still engaged in agriculture. Increasing agricultural production, on the one hand, solves their livelihood, and on the other hand, it increases a large amount of materials that can be used for consumption, manufacturing, and even for export, foreign exchange, tax revenue, and abundant food, while reducing unemployment, reducing thieves, improving public security, suppressing prices, and so on. Don't you see the predicament of many factories now? They cannot apply for foreign exchange, and they cannot import raw materials, so they are faced with the risk of closing down. The rural areas are in decline, the purchasing power of most people is declining, and they are faced with the pain of stagnation and difficulty in sales, and unsmooth turnover. Judging from this, the increase in the production of handicrafts still depends on the increase in the production of agricultural products; the cause and effect are very obvious. Therefore, it is not necessary to talk about increasing production, but if we want to talk about increasing production, although we should start with agricultural products, there is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>So, why don't we start here quickly? We must know that in the past and now, it is not that we absolutely ignore the rural areas, nor is it that we have done nothing, but that the methods adopted are too impractical and untimely.</p>
<p>Any plan must adapt to the environment. Medicine that is not right for the disease is the same as no medicine, or even aggravates the inherent disease. Therefore, simply copying other people's prescriptions or talking about pathology, ignoring the actual clinical diagnosis, is definitely not permitted by the principle of prescribing medicine according to the disease. The current rural area is a disease that occurs at the same time; its condition is indeed too complicated. Roughly speaking, such as: (1) Natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and hail, (2) Insect pests such as locusts, (3) Man-made disasters such as civil strife, bandits, corvée, apportionment, service, and requisition, (4) Lack of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and funds, (5) Backward technology, (6) Disrepair of water conservancy, (7) Dumping of foreign goods, (8) Stagnation of sales of export goods, etc. And the most serious fatal injuries are:</p>
<p>First, strong men abandon their fields and scatter to all directions;</p>
<p>Second, they want to cultivate but have no capital, and vast fields are barren;</p>
<p>Third, agricultural products cannot be proportional to other prices, and the same price rises, resulting in deeper poverty;</p>
<p>Fourth, exploitation is too heavy, and the people cannot live;</p>
<p>Fifth, family handicrafts are defeated by emerging enterprises and foreign goods, and the path of sideline occupations</p>
<p>If we can prescribe the right medicine for the disease, aim at the above-mentioned diseases, and quickly catch up and treat them separately, it will not be difficult to gradually improve over time. Moreover, items (1) and (4) are all due to human affairs, and it is not difficult to reform them. As long as we are open and honest, eliminate troubles and remove abuses, so that farmers have a career to enjoy and a place to live in peace, we do not need to comfort and recruit them, and they will naturally return to agriculture and reorganize their fields and life. As for item (2), agricultural funds and fertilizers, seeds, agricultural tools, etc., there are now many agricultural financial institutions and many foreign relief items. If we can simplify procedures, distribute them properly, not concentrate on limited areas and businesses, and not focus on cumbersome procedures and forms, then the daily count will be insufficient, and the annual count may be more than enough. The only thing that is relatively difficult to achieve rapid results and must be promoted, guided, and gradually grown is item (5), sideline occupations.</p>
<p>What are the actual countermeasures now? The economic reform plan proposed by the Executive Yuan is relatively concrete; among them, the item of developing agriculture lists nine measures: (1) Reform the distribution relationship of agricultural land, and try to realize the principle that those who cultivate have their own land; (2) Hold collective farms, use new machines, and methods; (3) Issue public bonds and actively build water conservancy; (4) Expand cooperatives to facilitate agricultural loans; (5) Actively and universally build a warehouse system; (6) Widely set up nursery countries; (7) Train technology and develop sideline occupations; (8) Develop animal husbandry, (9) Reward fishery. If this plan is only viewed from the text, it can naturally be regarded as a well-organized and orderly plan; however, if we investigate it from the facts, we will find that there are still several shortcomings, which are all obvious. First, most of them are time-consuming and require a long period of preparation; they are not suitable for emergency use; second, items (1), (2), (3), and (5) may not be able to be implemented at least at present; third, those who cultivate their own land are supporting the small-peasant system, which is not consistent with the nature of collective farms that use new machines; fourth, many of the most serious fatal injuries in the current rural areas mentioned in the previous article are not touched. We dare not be self-righteous and say that we are right. However, the current rural areas have reached the point where they need emergency rescue, and the increase in agricultural products cannot be expected after a long period of time, and it does not necessarily have to wait until after a long period of time. This seems to always be the case. Therefore, while we are trying to cure the root cause, we cannot but quickly treat the symptoms. Moreover, stabilizing the rural areas, farmers returning to cultivation, eliminating troublesome matters, and relieving suffering, these are indeed measures to treat the symptoms; but they are also not a plan to cure the root cause. If the scattered farmers cannot be made to return to cultivation, and the agricultural products they grow cannot be made profitable, then even if the land is redistributed and the farm tools are mechanized, and the technology is scientific, the peasants will still stop plowing and sigh on the ridge, and I don't know who will use these lands and new machines? Labor is one of the factors of production. Without labor, there is no production, and how can we talk about increasing production? The proverb says: "If there are many who produce and few who consume, then wealth will always be sufficient." If we want to hope to control objects with objects and control objects with quantity, then we have to focus on the increase of agricultural products. To demand the increase of agricultural products, we have to demand the so-called resumption of cultivation movement as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Truman Delivers Independence Day Speech: Discusses Prerequisites for Peace and Indirectly Criticizes Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The US President recently delivered a broadcast speech at President Jefferson's former residence to commemorate American Independence. He called on Americans and countries around the world to break down artificial barriers so that they are not isolated from each other, and urged mutual tolerance so that knowledge and ideals leading to a harmonious world can be freely exchanged. Mr. Truman praised President Jefferson's philosophy of "inalienable rights," a truth that has now been incorporated into the United Nations Charter. He pointed out four key conditions for peace: (1) Common compliance with the just authority of government, which comes from the consent of the governed; (2) Common respect for the fundamental rights of mankind; (3) Full and free exchange of all kinds of knowledge, ideals, and information by people around the world; International travel and communication should be granted the greatest freedom; (4) Countries should formulate financial and economic policies to support the world economy, rather than individual nationalist economies.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Charlottesville, Virginia, 4th Dispatch] President Truman delivered a severe speech here today, severely criticizing the Soviet Union's opposition to Secretary of State Marshall's economic aid plan. Although he did not directly mention Molotov's name, everything he said was criticizing the Soviet Union's ability, which led to the failure of the Paris Economic Conference. His wording was severe and straightforward. He said that this opposition to Marshall's proposal was like a person refusing to jointly run a profitable business on the grounds that it would interfere with his private affairs, which is absurd. Lack of trust between countries is the main cause of war. Countries that live in peace with each other should especially establish political and economic cooperative relations. The United States has fulfilled all its obligations to establish a peaceful economic state, but it is not enough for only one country to abide by its responsibility to revive the world. This requires cooperation between all countries to achieve this complete success. Food, clothing, and housing are still urgent needs, and they still need the efforts of all countries to solve them. In terms of foreign anti-American propaganda, a certain number of countries are deliberately distorting the facts of other countries and propagating them to their own people, causing them to distrust or despise their neighbors. This kind of action is misleading the people and runs counter to the efforts to create peace and unity. Today, there are some countries whose governments are restricting public opinion. We must know that the stronger the voice to formulate national policies with public opinion, the more the crisis of aggression can be reduced. Therefore, if governments can follow public opinion, then permanent peace is hopeful. Our goal is not only to seek peace for the present, but also to seek permanent peace.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Returns to London; French Foreign Ministry Denies Reports of Bidault's Visit to Britain</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned here by plane from Paris at 3:20 PM today. The Foreign Secretary took off from Paris at 1:52 PM. Before leaving, he met with French Foreign Minister Bidault and talked for two hours.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Prime Minister Attlee this morning to report on the results of the recent Paris Conference.

<h3>Other Countries Participating in European Conference: The Soviet Union Should Not Obstruct</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 4th Broadcast: A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated that the Soviet Union's attempt to intimidate countries invited to participate in the European Recovery Conference is tantamount to infringing upon the sovereignty of those countries. They further stated that the UK and France leave it entirely to the invited countries to decide whether or not to participate, but they must choose either attendance or non-attendance, and will not be allowed to participate in the conference as "observers." Another report: Personnel at the Paris Foreign Ministry anticipate that Poland and Czechoslovakia, despite their close ties with the Soviet Union, may accept the invitation to attend the European Recovery Conference scheduled for July 12th.</p>
<h3>General Eisenhower's Speech Advocates Strengthening Peace Organizations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vicksburg, Mississippi, 4th Dispatch] Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a speech here today, on American Independence Day, forcefully stating that the United States will advance its mission of establishing a global pacification mechanism, even if its proposals and charitable actions are misinterpreted. General Eisenhower stated that the world still lacks a strong international organization to mediate disputes and enforce resolutions. If the United States does not contribute to the establishment of a world peace organization, humanity will suffer the catastrophe of a third world war. The United States deeply understands that no single nation, no matter how strong or wealthy, can guarantee its own security; in essence, all nations must cooperate because the United States itself cannot establish future defense plans alone.</p>
<h3>General MacArthur's Article Condemns Despotic Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch] In commemoration of American Independence Day, General MacArthur sent a letter to "Life Magazine," stating: "When despotism controls the lives of the people and plunges other nations into the shackles of its enslavement, peace will be hindered, and the crisis of war will loom large." General MacArthur did not specify the nation practicing despotism, but there is no doubt as to whom he was referring. He specifically called upon the American people in the letter to "fulfill our responsibility to other peoples with a spirit of great fearlessness" and to lead them towards a world of peace and seek good human relations.</p>

<h3>Failure of the Paris Three-Foreign Ministers Conference May Impact UK-Soviet Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch] Well-informed sources stated tonight that the failure of the Paris Three-Foreign Ministers Conference and the UK's decision to continue pursuing the Marshall Plan despite the Soviet Union's attitude may have a serious impact on the current UK-Soviet trade negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] Although the UK has broken with the Soviet Union at the Paris Conference, it will continue to advance its trade expansion plans in Eastern Europe. According to a government spokesperson today, the cabinet has considered this issue, and Prime Minister Attlee spoke by phone with Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris.

British officials expect several Eastern European countries to refuse to participate in the Paris Conference on July 12th, but British trade delegations in the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Yugoslavia will still negotiate trade agreements with those countries. It is expected that the UK will advance its foreign trade policy based on multilateral and reciprocal principles, without excluding any country.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Considering Responses to Invitations from the British and French Governments; Secretary Marshall Supports UK and France's Efforts to Unite Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd Dispatch] The governments of the UK and France have sent invitations to the governments of twenty-two European nations, inviting them to convene in Paris on July 12th to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan for European aid. The governments of these countries are all considering their responses tonight. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall has assured the UK and France in Washington, expressing support for the efforts of the UK and France to unite Europe in response to the aid plan.</p>
<p>A summary of the reactions of European countries is as follows: A spokesperson for the Swedish Foreign Ministry denied the Paris report that Sweden fears the Soviet Union and does not dare to participate in the planning under the Marshall Plan. Semi-official sources also stated that Sweden is eager to participate in this work. The Czech cabinet is expected to meet on Friday to seriously consider whether to participate in the Marshall Plan and the conference convened by the UK and France. The participation of the Czech Republic in the Eastern or Western camp is approaching the final decision stage. It is generally believed that although the Czech Republic has a political alliance with the East, it still relies heavily on the West in other respects. Political figures in Vienna, Austria, expect Austria to decide to accept the invitation from the UK and France. A spokesperson for the Socialist Party stated that accepting the invitation from the UK and France is not enough to indicate Austria's affiliation with the Western bloc. The moderate factions and opposition parties in Hungary originally placed great hope on the talks between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union in Paris; the failure of the negotiations has deeply disappointed them. Italian public opinion can generally be seen in the Rome independent newspaper "Messaggero," which stated that "the cornerstone of the Western bloc has been laid by the Soviet representatives. Within a few days, the UK and France will begin to build walls on this cornerstone."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 3rd Dispatch] The governments of the UK and France have formally invited the governments of twenty-two European countries to send representatives to meet in Paris on July 12th to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan for European aid.

According to a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry, accepting the invitation only indicates acceptance of the French plan in principle; any country participating in the July 12th conference may propose amendments. Spain has not been invited for the time being, the intention being that if there is a change in the Spanish government, it will be invited to participate in the conference. Regarding the German portion of the French plan, the commanders-in-chief of the various German zones have agreed to cooperate in the exchange of materials between the German zones and with other countries.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Indonesian News; Cold Reaction from the Netherlands; Believes It Cannot Improve Relations</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent, Batavia, 3rd Dispatch] According to reliable sources: Political figures in the Netherlands believe that the formation of a new government in the Indonesian Republic, with former Defense Minister Sjahrir as Prime Minister, will not have a positive impact on relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia.

<h3>Katayama and Wada Express Japan's Urgent Need for Loans</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd Dispatch] Hiroo Wada, Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, stated that he has now discovered that Japan must immediately request loans from the Allied authorities. Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama stated that the Japanese government will make every possible effort to thoroughly resolve Japan's economic problems, but without the assistance of other countries, it will be extremely difficult to promote its production work.

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] The Japanese government released an economic white paper today, warning the nation that the country is in a serious state and is facing further difficulties, with a crisis imminent.

<h3>Marshall's Economic Aid to Europe Plan May Face Difficulty in Gaining Congressional Support; Many Points of Disagreement Between Congress and the Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] American diplomats believe that the Soviet Union's rejection of the Marshall Plan makes it easier to allocate funds solely to aid Western Europe, but this matter generated dangerous signals in Congress on the 4th.</p>
<p>A series of events have made some diplomats, who were willing to present the plan to Congress, hesitant. Passing an additional tens of billions of dollars, even if specifically for European use, will, according to official opinion, become a "superficial proposal." Officials believe that the recent developments in Congress include the following facts worth noting: First, Rep. Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, issued a statement saying that the State Department has failed to explain the justification for the $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, and to date, several items have not been designated for use in that plan. Second, Taber opposed allocating $370 million to authorize the State Department for foreign relief for the same reason, a portion of which would be allocated to Western Europe and a portion to China. Third, Senator Taft criticized the State Department's request to extend import and export controls for another year, so that scarce commodities could be evenly distributed, as inappropriate. Taft specifically opposed continuing to control fats and oils, the lack of which is most serious. State Department officials deeply fear that this reaction from Congress will affect timid European countries, making them afraid to resolutely participate in the Western European economic self-reliance plan. They point out that if there is doubt about Congress allocating additional funds to aid Europe, the Marshall Plan is in danger of collapse. This development will greatly benefit the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Advocates Ending the Collection of Reparations from Germany and Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee submitted a report today stating that the United States must insist on ending the collection of reparations from Germany and Japan so that the economies of those two countries can become self-sufficient. The submission of this report comes the day after Molotov rejected Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan and states, "We do not believe this is the end of U.S. aid to Europe." The report estimates that European recovery will require the United States to provide $10 billion in loans or grants from 1947 to 1949, including the UK but excluding the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Political Merger of the British and American Occupation Zones in Germany Moves Closer; General Clay and Harriman Arrive in Berlin Together</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch] General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in Germany, stated in a conversation with reporters here today, "I hope the failure of the Paris Three-Foreign Ministers Conference will not increase the difficulty of unifying Germany, but any situation that makes Germany and the unification work more difficult will make the trend toward our political merger closer." When asked if there are any developments that could bring the British and American zones closer to political merger before the London Foreign Ministers Conference in November, he replied that it is certainly not being considered at this time. When asked whether the failure of the Paris Conference would lead to a merger of the French zone with the British and American zones, Clay said that if France is willing to participate, the UK and the US would be very happy. Clay also said that Moses, the New York City Commissioner of Construction, has arrived in Germany at his invitation to study the housing problem in the Ruhr region and suggest steps to increase coal production. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Secretary of Agriculture Anderson arrived in Berlin today for the same purpose. After obtaining the approval of the British authorities, they will inspect the British military zone. Clay also said that Harriman will study Germany's export problems, and Anderson will investigate Germany's food situation.</p>

<h3>Equipment Worth Over 10 Billion Sold at Auction for Over 1 Million; Qingdao Renfeng Yarn Factory Sues the Central Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Qingdao Renfeng Yarn Factory, operated by the Bank of China, recently filed a lawsuit with the local court in this city, accusing Wu Rencang, the director of the Central Trust Bureau and concurrently the director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, and He Shengdi, the manager of Wufuji in Gujia Lane 51, Beijing Road, of improper sale, requesting a judgment that the sales contract is invalid. The original complaint stated: The Renfeng Yarn Factory is operated jointly by the Qingdao branch of the Bank of China. Before the War of Resistance, it ordered a 160063 turbine generator from the UK, totaling 39 boxes, which arrived in Shanghai in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940]. 33 boxes were transferred by the Bank of China and stored in the bank's Suzhou River warehouse. The remaining six boxes were stored at the Blue Eyed Pier due to their large size and inconvenient transportation. Subsequently, the Pacific War broke out, the pier was occupied by Japanese invaders, and the generator was seized. After the victory, Zhu Yuqiu, a staff member of the Qingdao branch of the Bank of China stationed in Shanghai, went to supervise the Blue Eyed Pier</p>
<h3>Large and Small Cinemas Brewing Price Increases</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Amidst the rising prices of various goods, the ticket prices of large and small cinemas in this city are brewing adjustments again. The cinema industry has held preliminary consultations, but in view of the considerable twists and turns in the previous request for price increases, it is planned to first collect detailed information on the business conditions of each cinema to prove that the income and expenses of most cinemas cannot be offset, so as to invite the permission of the authorities. These days, cinemas are rushing to settle the accounts for the previous month for submission to the industry association for compilation, and then formally requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to approve price increases.</p>
<h3>Planning to Strengthen Economic Supervision; Discussing the Establishment of a Joint Office</h3>
<p>Police Bureau Director Yu told reporters yesterday afternoon that in order to strengthen the implementation of economic supervision and unify the pace, he has formally submitted a suggestion to Mayor Wu to establish joint offices for gold notes, cotton cloth, food, and fuel. Mayor Wu agreed to submit it to the next Economic Supervision Committee report for discussion and decision. It is generally expected that this suggestion is in line with the needs and can be approved, possibly with Mayor Wu concurrently serving as the director of the office, and Yu Shuping and Wu Kaixian concurrently serving as deputy directors. It was found that of the six large boxes of equipment, except for one box that had been removed by the Japanese invaders, the remaining five boxes were still there, but had been taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and were being requested by the bank for return. Unexpectedly, the equipment had been handed over to the customs by the bureau for auction, and was sold to Wufuji for 1,768,000 legal currency. The Bank of China believes that the value of the equipment is approximately over 10 billion yuan, but it was sold at auction for only a meager price of over 1 million yuan. If new items are reordered, it will take at least two years, so it filed a lawsuit against the Central Trust Bureau Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office and Wufuji, requesting a judgment: (1) Confirming that the act of auctioning five pieces of turbine generator equipment is invalid. (2) Allowing the plaintiff to hand over 1,768,000 legal currency to Wufuji after Tian Yuangao delivers the above equipment, and Wufuji is responsible for returning it. (3) Allowing the plaintiff to provide a deposit to declare a provisional execution. (4) The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant. This case will be heard in court by the local court in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Profit and Loss Tax for the 36th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1947] to Implement "Standard Tax Assessment"</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the Director of the Direct Tax Bureau, Yuan Quandi, who told reporters that the "standard tax assessment" for the profit and loss tax for the 36th year has been implemented yesterday. The profit and loss tax is originally a tax based on account investigation, but now the Ministry of Finance is acting in accordance with the requirements of the industrial and commercial sectors to implement "standard tax assessment." The so-called "standard tax assessment" is to selectively check the accounts of 5% to 10% of normally operating commercial firms, and determine the profit level of each industry as the standard tax. Although this method is not as accurate and fair as a universal account investigation, it is more reasonable than the simplified assessment of... As for depreciation inventory and expenditure issues, they will all be executed in accordance with the tax law.</p>

<h3>Militia Kills Person; Police Chief Summoned; Prosecutor Investigates Scene; Three Bullet Casings Found</h3>

After the dispute was resolved, he returned to the police bureau. He had no prior knowledge of the militiaman Gu Weijun breaking into Wang's residence and shooting Wang Wanshun.

Relevant witnesses will be summoned again next week to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Huge Swindle; Spouting Nonsense; Impersonating Director of National Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Office; "Training Children" to Lure People into Trap; Li Yuexuan Lured by Profit Sues for Justice</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In June of last year, Li Yuexuan of Henan and others were introduced by a friend to Zhang Ruoyu, who claimed to be the Director of the Foreign Exchange Control Office of the Central Bank. Zhang, posing as a high-ranking military and political figure, falsely claimed to represent the American United Oil Company, identifying Cai Wenwei as the company's representative, and declared his intention to develop business in China, asserting that anyone who could order 10,000 barrels of kerosene would obtain the position of general manager. Zhang also fabricated a so-called "Zhitong New Construction Silver Company," a financial group affiliated with the Central Political Clique, claiming that it had funds of US$70 million and that he was its representative, promising to support Li with financial resources. Li then signed a contract with Cai to purchase 10,000 barrels of kerosene, paying a deposit of 30 million yuan. Zhang falsely claimed to "lend" the remaining amount, and Cai issued a receipt for US$119,250. Subsequently, after promoting sales in the Henan area, setting a price of 1,350 barrels of kerosene, and collecting 155.359 million yuan in kerosene payments, Cai and others continued to stall for more than two months. By this time, customers waiting for the kerosene were extremely anxious and suspicious. After inquiring from various sources, they learned that Zhang's claims of holding various important positions were purely fraudulent. It is reported that Zhang frequently mentioned President Song and Minister He, speaking with the air of an important figure, and trained his concubine, Liu Meihe, and several young daughters. Every time they saw a photo of Chairman Chiang, they would call him "adoptive grandfather," and he would make these young daughters say they had been to his home with their mother, making people deeply believe him and allowing him to carry out his fraudulent activities. The so-called "United Oil Company" did not exist, and there were no millions of barrels of oil. The only thing they had to stall with was the receipt for about one-tenth of the deposit paid to Dahua Company last September for purchasing 1,000 boxes of Texaco kerosene. Zhang claimed to be a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, and under the "Service Unit" section of his national identification card, he wrote "Member of the Military Affairs Commission." He was arrested by the Garrison Command on May 23rd and released on June 12th. Now, Li and others have filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Zhang, Cai, and Liu Meihe of jointly plotting to defraud and requesting an investigation, as well as demanding the return of 409 large barrels of kerosene containing 53 plus gallons. Yesterday, Judge Cao Fuwei interrogated Cai alone, as the plaintiff was not present. After the court inquired briefly, it was determined that the details needed to be presented by the plaintiff himself, and the hearing was rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Zheng Hongnian's Retrial; States He Took on Fake Post Out of Necessity; Requests Bail Due to Old Age and Illness</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Hongnian, the former president of the National Jinan University and the president of the puppet Central China Railway Company, was accused of being a traitor. The High Court originally sentenced him to eight years of imprisonment, but Zheng refused to accept it and appealed for a retrial. The Supreme Court sent it back for a retrial. The case was heard yesterday in the High Court by Presiding Judge Liu Yugui.

<h3>Ministry of Education Announces List of Successful Candidates for Screening Students Transferring to Specialized Fields or Higher Yesterday; 353 Successful Candidates in Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Education announced on the 4th the list of successful candidates for the screening of students transferring to specialized fields or higher in the Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou areas: (1) Nanjing area: Gu Yayan and 312 others; (2) Shanghai area: Zhang Yu and 353 others; (3) Beiping-Tianjin area: Sun Guiqing and 2299 others; (4) Guangzhou area: Mai Ciyuan and 52 others.</p>

<h3>English Tests at American Universities Do Not Hinder Foreign Students' Pursuit of Studies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd dispatch] It has recently been learned from authoritative sources that English tests conducted by American universities for foreign students are not a necessary condition for students from China and other countries to obtain visas for studying in the United States. Whether the English test is passed is determined by each school itself. Therefore, the test does not affect foreign students' ability to obtain visas, except when permission from an American university is a necessary condition for applying for a visa. If a foreign student fails an English test at one university, he can still apply to other schools that do not require the test. Therefore, the English test does not hinder foreign students from pursuing studies in the United States. Whether American universities adopt the test method also varies from school to school. This type of test will be administered by the University Entrance Examination Committee and funded by the State Department. The committee originally handled entrance examinations for American universities, but it also often decides on other educational policies or plans. The English test for foreign students is one such example. The details of the committee's tests for foreign students are not yet known, but the policies it has adopted historically have been extremely fair.</p>

<h3>Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association Decides on Common Distribution Regulations, Detailed Measures to be Studied by Subcommittee</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at approximately 3 PM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wang Qiyu and adjourned at approximately 6 PM.</p>
<p>There were five important reports yesterday: (A) The Textile Regulation Committee's handling of the joint distribution case: This case was discussed in detail by the Textile Regulation Committee's third committee meeting, which believed that the principle of joint distribution was still feasible. However, the detailed measures should be determined separately within two weeks. However, temporary joint distribution will be carried out from Monday, the 20th of this month. The method is that state-owned and private yarn mills each submit 10,000 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn to the Textile Regulation Committee for distribution (handled by the Product Distribution Subcommittee of the Textile Regulation Committee, supervised by the Business Department). From the 20th of this month, the yarn should be delivered in equal installments over 15 days. The cotton yarn to be delivered by private yarn mills should be sent to the Textile Regulation Committee for verification and receipt by the Sixth District Association.</p>
<p>The Sixth District Association has drafted five common distribution regulations and prepared a calculation table and reservation form for distribution to member factories for verification and implementation. The common distribution regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The total amount of cotton yarn for this distribution is 20,000 bales of 20-count yarn, with state-owned factories and private factories each accounting for 10,000 bales. The private factories are calculated based on the number of spindles started in March according to the cotton allocation survey form for the 41 factories in Shanghai and the 26 factories in other cities that recently received cotton.</p>
<p>2.  Each factory should issue a reservation form for the amount of 20-count cotton yarn allocated according to the allocation table and send it to the Sixth District Association, which will forward it to the Textile Regulation Committee for distribution. This reservation form should be issued for each piece of yarn, or several reservation forms may be issued for half the amount of yarn.</p>
<p>3.  The Textile Regulation Committee will distribute based on the reservation forms sent by each factory. After receiving the reservation form distributed by the Textile Regulation Committee, each factory should immediately collect the payment and exchange it for a warehouse receipt.</p>
<p>4.  The deadline for factories to send reservation forms is July 5th, and they should be sent to the Sixth District Association for forwarding to the Textile Regulation Committee. The goods should be delivered in full by July 15th. If the distribution has not been completed by the deadline, they should reserve the goods for delivery at any time.</p>
<p>5.  The "Total Value" column of the reservation form should be filled in by the Textile Regulation Committee according to the negotiated price at the time of distribution. The "Distribution Period" item should also be filled in by the Textile Regulation Committee. (B) The prices of cotton yarn of various counts have been ordered and announced by the Textile Regulation Committee's Pricing Subcommittee. It is hoped that member factories will strictly abide by them.</p>
<p>Among the discussed cases, the main one was to study the detailed measures for joint distribution. It was resolved that a subcommittee of seven people, including Tong Runfu, Han Zhiming, Zhang Wenqian, Liu Jingji, and Ye Erren, would be formed to specialize in research in order to formulate a specific plan to be submitted to the Textile Regulation Committee meeting to be held on the 8th for discussion.</p>
<h3>Buying Sentiment Suddenly Turns Strong, Most Chinese Stocks Rebound, China Rich and Diligence Allied Rise to Limit</h3>
<p>The stock market initially opened flat yesterday, then became active. Yong'an Yarn was repeatedly advancing and returning, showing signs of hesitation, but small stocks such as China Rich and New Light were very stable. In particular, China Rich Enamelware had a new look, progressing steadily and reaching the limit first. After this change, the buying opportunity exceeded the limit, and the situation turned around. As a result, the market price of Yong'an Yarn felt very worthwhile. The Bank of China helped to absorb it first, and active elements took the opportunity to surpass it. The trading floor suddenly appeared exhausted, and off-market interest rates decreased to 2.4 to 2.85%. At noon, there was a general reaction, and many miscellaneous stocks reached their limit. However, the future will depend on the movement of the money supply.</p>
<p>In the early morning, people still had no interest. Among the spot stocks, only China Sports opened slightly higher, while the remaining stocks did not open at all. When Yong'an Yarn entered the market, it also saw a slight increase. After opening, numbers 71, 65, 142, 14, 224, 232, 228, and 212 showed eager demand. Number 177 even advanced to the spot Yong'an Yarn, pushing the forward Yong'an Yarn up to 8500 yuan. Numbers 157 and 85 took the opportunity to sell, while numbers 190, 183, and 32 were still buying, forming a saw-tooth pattern. Numbers 73, 85, 128, and 223 concluded their transactions and lowered the price to within 8400 yuan. Numbers 185 and 4 bought the spot Yong'an Yarn, and number 222 also purchased the forward Yong'an Yarn, pushing the price back up to above 8500 yuan. Number 17 had supply and struggled slightly. Number 157 once bought in, and numbers 160, 142, and 22 advanced further to 8600 yuan. Numbers 73, 157, 231, Er Xi, 110, 22, 76, Ji Yi, and 83 all sold out, lowering the price to 8350 yuan. Numbers 106, 235, and 180 took advantage of the low price to advance to 8470 yuan. Number 157's willingness to sell did not diminish, while number 102 advanced, causing the price to hover again.</p>
<p>Later, numbers 61, 171, and 157 competed to acquire the spot Yong'an Yarn, while numbers 148 and 71 sold the forward Yong'an Yarn, and number 48 also had supply, causing the price to be forced down to around 8270 yuan. The spot Yong'an Yarn then retreated to around 8100 yuan. Numbers 215, 224, and 12 Heaven took advantage of the low price to advance to 8450 yuan. Numbers 91 and 219 were still selling at within 8300 yuan. Afterwards, due to the constant advances of various small stocks and miscellaneous brands, China Rich, under the leadership of number 107, revitalized and was first pulled to the limit by numbers 107 and 8. As a result, in a situation where everyone felt that it was extremely cheap, Yong'an Yarn also aroused speculative sentiment. Numbers 207 and 31, the bank gang, and active elements, numbers 224, 160, and 4, and numbers 232, 65, 158, 41, 8, and 32 all came to compete for purchases, gradually increasing the price. The approaching of the closing was even more enthusiastic. Diligence Allied and New China Li'an approached the limit and had transactions. Yong Mud, led by number 174, National Goods, led by number 153, and China France, led by number 59, all reached their limit. The forward Yong'an Yarn then rose to 8750 yuan, and the spot Yong'an Yarn also ended at a high price of 8430 yuan. After the close, number 14 and others had buy orders, calling a high price of 8800.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to the previous closing, the spot stocks of China Rich and Diligence Allied rose to the limit, King Fu rose by 10%, and Yong'an Yarn, Faith Harmony, New Light, and Yong Gong each rose by about 5%. US Asia rose slightly, New China and China France also reached the limit, Business Rich slightly decreased, United China was flat, Matches Underwear rose by 5%, and China Textile King Lun Cement each rose by about 10%. The remaining stocks only saw a slight increase. Among the forward stocks, China Rich rose to the limit, King Fu rose by 10%, and Yong'an Yarn and New Light each rose by 5%, with US Asia Harmony rising slightly. Among the off-market old stocks, Great Life China rose slightly, while World South Ocean Zhabei China Business Five Continents all appeared stable.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds were weak yesterday as settlements decreased. Number 555 sold out, and Unified C opened at 7300 yuan, starting from 76600 and falling to a low price of 6300 yuan at the close. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds fell by 710 yuan, Class C fell by 1100 yuan, Class D fell by 600 yuan, and Class E also fell by a small amount of 400 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 1 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to decline yesterday. Although foreign merchants and securities firms were buying, gold shops and Guang merchants were selling, causing the stocks to be weak overall. The sparse trading volume led to an oversupply. As a result, compared to the previous close, Paper Industry fell by slightly over 10%, Shipping was flat, Yi He Industry Guang fell slightly, and the remaining stocks each fell by about 5%.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Stabilizes After Falling, Factory Silk Market Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market initially opened flat yesterday and then strengthened. Number 120 Heavenly Bridge New Loan opened at 24.7 million yuan, and Hsu Zi called 4.5 million yuan. Because practical sales accounts came to slightly absorb, the market turned better, gradually rising. At the noon close, Hsu Zi was 25 million yuan, and the Heavenly Bridge New Goods was 100,000 yuan higher. In the afternoon, the stock market rose, and factory silk also appeared strong. Silk factories continued to buy, making the market even more brisk. The final transaction was at 5.6 million yuan, 1 million yuan higher than the previous day's price. Number 75 Golden Chicken Half-Light called prices rose accordingly.</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory warp market was slightly higher than the previous day, and trading was fairly active. Grade C was traded at 32.51 million yuan, Grade D opened at 2 million yuan, and Grade E at 1.5 million yuan also had transactions. However, all had several days of lead time. Grade AB had very little inventory in the market, and calling prices were higher. No sales were made yesterday. The dry warp market was quieter. Five-bundle lots called for prices were still at the price of 22 million yuan, and small lots were 19.5 to 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw Big Sincerity face fabric trade at 2.3 to 2.35 million yuan, and Better Fabric between 2.2 and 2.25 million yuan. Big Grid Wall Cloth always hovered between 41,200 and 41,300 yuan, the smallest being 100 yuan, and the final transaction was 300 yuan, with next-day trading at 1,400-1,500 yuan, 500 yuan higher than the previous day. China Splendor Crepe high-end goods traded at 212,500 yuan, and secondary goods traded at 25300 yuan. Asia's Ling Peike was very popular, with high-end goods trading at 345,000 yuan and secondary goods trading at 323,000 yuan. The remaining goods remained firm.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Flat and Weak</p>
<p>Due to falling yarn prices, the current cotton market was trending weak. However, high-end cotton was still in demand from fine yarn mills because of the brisk fine yarn prices, making it difficult for prices to fall much. The common grades were not in high demand, and prices were softer. Customers were not willing to sell cheaply because of poor sources and low inventory in Shanghai. Trading was slightly more active than the previous day. The factory prices for various grades were: Bao 2.02 million, Shashi special 1.92 million. Spot exchange prices were planned at 1.87 to 1.98 million, Shashi at 1.85 million, US Metre Lin at 1.97 million, Hankou fine velvet at 1.6 million, Chong Zhou at 1.61 million, South Pacific Innovation at 1.61 million, Donggou at 16 million, Pudong Fire Machine at 1.44 million, 1.5 to 1.55 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 265,000 to 285,000 per bundle.</p>

<h3>Buying Sentiment Weakens, Sales Stagnate, Food Prices Decline, High-Grade White Rice Decreases by Over 20,000 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the North and South markets was over 5,600 shi. All grains declined across the board. Indica rice had sources arriving from various ports along the Yangtze River, as well as from the Jinpu Line and northern Jiangsu. Sales were stagnant, and there were no buyers, causing a continued sharp decline of 31,000 yuan. Japonica rice was the same, falling by 20,000 yuan, White Yuan Yin Yuan followed the decline by 1-20,000 yuan, and Medium Secondary Guest Yuan plunged by 230,000 yuan, with few inquiries.</p>
<p>Flour declined sharply, following the decline in the interior, and saw another sharp drop of 8-9,000 yuan. Foreign flour plummeted by 13-4,000 yuan, and bran plunged by 3-4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes had strong selling sentiment, declined in a straight line, and plummeted by 5-6,000 to 6-7,000 yuan. Soybeans also followed the decline in oil cakes and became sluggish, falling sharply by 3-5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Red beans were stable in Nanyang, but domestic sales were bleak, plunging by 2-30,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had few transactions in both Nanyang and domestic markets, plunging by 1-20,000 yuan. Red sorghum also shaved off 10,000 yuan. Corn declined again by 3-5,000 yuan. Broad beans were stable among guest merchants, down by 3-5,000 yuan. Factories had no desire for wheat and were waiting to see it fall further, declining again by 3-5,000 yuan. Mung beans had few arrivals and sales, remaining stable with Medium Secondary slightly higher by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market was full of selling sentiment. Buyers were waiting, and Hua Nan was stable. Goods from Yingkou had arrived, and Sichuan goods continued to arrive, causing market sentiment to be weak. Raw soybean oil and Clear Vegetable oil all plummeted by 30,000 yuan. Vegetable oil also decreased by 2-30,000 yuan, with cooked vegetable oil being the most sluggish. However, small cart rattan oil had more retail sales due to many vegetarians during the summer, forming a temporarily flat pattern.</p>
<p>Pilot Oil Rationing Before Mid-Month</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the City Social Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau will cooperate to pilot one oil rationing before the 15th of this month. The rationing price will be softer than the market price. The oil to be rationed will be raw oil and soybean oil, and each person can ration half a catty of oil each time. According to the city's population survey at the end of May of this year, the total population is approximately 4.17 million people. Therefore, the amount of oil to be rationed at one time is estimated to be 2.0885 million catties. It is said that the Central Trust Bureau has prepared a month's worth of oil for continuous rationing to citizens.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Rise Then Weaken</h3>
<p>The price of coal, anthracite, and other fuels had risen sharply in recent days due to hoarding, leading to sluggish sales and a slight softening of the market. While anthracite prices remain unchanged, sales are weak. Only bituminous coal continues to sell well due to its relatively low price. However, the significant difference between current market prices and production costs may affect future deliveries. Firewood and charcoal prices remain high, and sales are rather slow.</p>
<h3>Financial Yearbook to be Published Soon</h3>
<p>The "China Financial Yearbook," edited by the China Financial Yearbook Society for the 36th year, is a comprehensive national financial publication and will be published soon. It has been compiled over many years and consists of one million words divided into three sections.</p>
<h3>National Cement Association Requests Reduction of Cement Cargo Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The National Cement Association states that local cement cargo tax rates have been frequently adjusted recently. The special task of the cement industry in supplying construction needs is often overlooked, and the standards used are often inconsistent with reality. Therefore, it plans to send Directors Shi Naixiu, Secretary-General Chen Hanqing, and Deputy Secretary-General Xi Zhengxiu to Nanjing soon to meet with Director Jiang of the Tax Administration and present their case. The reasons for requesting a tax reduction are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The target of the cargo tax should be the goods themselves. However, due to a lack of packaging materials and high prices, the average packaging cost for cement accounts for one-fourth of the total cost. Since packaging costs are not deducted, the actual tax payable is at least one-fourth higher than it should be.</p>
<p>(2) According to cargo tax regulations, the taxable price should be based on the average wholesale price in the market near the place of production over the past three months. If the main market for the cement produced is located elsewhere than near the factory, and the selling price there is much lower than the price near the place of production, it would be unfair to set the cargo tax rate based on the wholesale price at the place of production, where sales volume is minimal.</p>
<p>(3) Cement factories currently supply over 70% of their products to government agencies for construction purposes. However, local tax bureaus often base their tax rates on the wholesale prices of the small amount of cement sold on the market, which is unreasonable.</p>
<p>(4) The tax rate implemented in Shanghai starting June 16 was based on the average market wholesale price for May alone, which does not comply with the cargo tax regulations that require calculation based on the wholesale prices for March, April, and May. Negotiations are underway to reduce this tax rate, but it increased again to 7,200 yuan starting July 3, which is an unbearable burden.</p>

<p>International Cooperation Day Message</p>
<p>Cooperation or Destruction by Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Amid the chaos at home and abroad today, we must put forward such a slogan: "Cooperation or Destruction."</p>
<p>A recent Reuters report stated that Professor W. C. Allee of the University of Chicago, in an article for the 1947 Encyclopedia Britannica, pointed out that Darwin's theory of "survival of the fittest" is untenable. He believes that animals (including humans) are more inclined to cooperate than to engage in anti-social behavior. An animal's life is, in fact, governed by a law: cooperate or die.</p>
<p>It is human nature for individuals, societies, nations, and the world to strive for goodness, just as it is natural for humans to seek wisdom. The value of group survival can be traced back to primitive life. Social life is not accidental; rather, it is a normal, fundamental, and universal phenomenon.</p>
<p>In fact, what Professor Allee says about the principle of evolution is more of an explanation than an original idea. For the past century, those involved in cooperative movements in various countries have been striving for and adhering to this principle. In particular, Dr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out more profoundly that mutual assistance is a principle of human evolution. He said: "Humans were initially no different from animals. After tens of thousands of years of evolution, they gradually developed human nature, and this marked the origin of human evolution. The principle of evolution in this period is mutual assistance. Society and the nation are the embodiment of mutual assistance. Morality and righteousness are the application of mutual assistance. Humans prosper by following this principle and perish by violating it. This principle has been practiced by humans for hundreds of thousands of years. However, humans have not yet fully adhered to this principle because they originated from animals, and their entry into the third stage of evolution is recent, so they have not been able to completely eliminate all inherited traits from animals. However, since humans entered civilization, they have naturally and unconsciously moved towards the principle of mutual assistance in order to achieve the goal of human evolution. What is the goal of human evolution? It is what Confucius called 'The Great Way prevails when the world is for all,' and what Jesus called 'Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.' This is what humans hope for: to transform the current world of suffering into a paradise of bliss."</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's saying "Prosper by following this principle and perish by violating it" precisely points out the "iron law of cooperation or destruction."</p>
<p>The recent World War, on the surface, has ended, but in reality, the war continues, with flames reaching the sky and war clouds gathering. There is simply no pure land left in the universe. How can we not be filled with fear and anxiety in this situation? Looking around, we see that the principle of competition still has an overwhelming advantage in politics, economics, and society. People are driven by this principle to the point of madness. Gradual encroachment is no longer enough to describe its ferocity. What a terrible phenomenon this is! When we reflect on this late at night, how can we, who call ourselves the lords of creation, not feel ashamed?</p>
<p>Fortunately, after a century of development, the cooperative movement has gradually grown into a grand sight. At least in the economic field, it has shown the certainty of mutual assistance as a principle of evolution. This is the long-awaited good news from the empty valley, a refreshing drink in the sweltering summer, and a ray of warmth in the gloomy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Naturally, the cooperative movement has not yet reached a stage of complete success, especially in China, where it is still in its early stages. It cannot be said to be satisfactory. However, remembering the lesson of "cooperation or destruction," we must not be complacent or discouraged. We firmly believe that our choice is the smartest and most correct one. Competition is a remnant of animality, while cooperation is the development of humanity. Transforming competition into cooperation is the only key to human evolution.</p>
<p>Recalling the eve of the First World War, the International Cooperative Alliance, recognizing the increasing tensions between countries, issued a righteous call for peace. Unfortunately, the power of the cooperative movement was not enough to eliminate war, and the First World War finally broke out in 1914. As the Second World War was about to break out, the International Cooperative Alliance again made calls for peace, issuing declarations at the 16th and 17th International Cooperative Days in 1938 and 1939, respectively, one titled "Peace Through Cooperation" and the other "On the Indivisibility of Cooperation, Peace, and Freedom." The response to these declarations was very enthusiastic. On July 4, 1939, the International Cooperative Alliance issued a statement in the names of its President Tanner and Secretary-General May, which included this passage: "Cooperators of the world, abandon all the prejudices and biases that may weaken your actions, set aside your economic interests, and use your greatest efforts to achieve the unity of all mankind in the pursuit of the final victory of justice!" Unfortunately, this call was still useless, and the Second World War ultimately broke out in September of that year. This historical fact shows that although the power of the cooperative movement was not large enough to prevent or eliminate war, it demonstrated a spirit of courage and perseverance, as well as a passion for the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>This year marks the 25th International Cooperative Day, and the world is still chaotic. With both anxiety and hope, we face reality and cherish ideals, and we cannot help but shout out the slogan "Cooperation or Destruction" to warn the world and encourage ourselves.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt of the United States wrote a letter to American cooperators in January 1944, in which he said: "I deeply anticipate the contribution that cooperatives around the world will make in the peaceful years that are soon to come." Yes, we cooperators must not belittle ourselves, because only we are the supporters and practitioners of the "cooperation or destruction" law. (July, 1947)</p>
<p>The Evolution of Cooperative Economics by Chen Zhongming</p>
<p>Cooperative economics is a democratic economic movement that grows out of the contradictions of capitalist economics. It arises against the backdrop of capitalist society and develops alongside the development of capitalist economics. After the development of capitalist economics, in the process of pursuing profits, the increasing concentration of capital leads to a more widespread separation of the means of production from the producers. As a result, the survival rights of the general public are increasingly controlled by a minority. Cooperative economics emerges as a form of resistance to this phenomenon: credit cooperatives (or cooperative finance) resist centralized financial capital, utilization cooperatives reclaim centralized means of production, and consumer (supply) cooperatives and marketing cooperatives (or cooperative marketing) prevent the monopolization of commercial capital. In the various stages of capitalist economic development, the forms of capital control differ, and correspondingly, the mainstream of cooperative economics also differs. Generally speaking, consumer cooperation corresponds to commercial capital, labor cooperation corresponds to industrial capital, credit cooperation (or cooperative finance) corresponds to financial capital, and in the current stage of imperialism, the dominant form of cooperative economics is agricultural cooperation.</p>
<p>The key difference between cooperative economics and capitalist economics is that the former aims to promote mutual benefit, while the latter aims to pursue profit. The former is self-help, mutual aid, coexistence, and co-prosperity, while the latter is free competition and profit monopolization. Therefore, although cooperative economics is nurtured by capitalism, it is inevitably a negation of capitalist economics.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, cooperative economics is a byproduct of capitalist economic development. Therefore, from the perspective of its origin, it has a natural mission to oppose capitalist economics. England was the first country to develop capitalism, so cooperative economics also took root in England. In the early 19th century, after the development of capitalism in England, the most serious social problem was the labor problem. In other words, the difficulty of workers' lives and the opposition between the labor and capital classes were the center of all social problems at that time. Therefore, various forms of socialism aimed to solve this problem, and cooperative economics emerged as a consumer cooperative enterprise form aimed at solving the living problems of the working class.</p>
<p>Later, this democratic economic movement crossed the English Channel and spread to continental Europe, first developing in France. The industrial revolution in France lagged behind England by twenty or thirty years, and the economic situation at that time was quite different from that of England. The most serious social problem caused by the development of capitalism in France was not the poverty of workers, but rather the misery of independent small producers, especially urban handicraftsmen, who were oppressed and ruined by mechanical industries. Therefore, the cooperative economic enterprises in France changed slightly, with industrial cooperation aimed at rescuing urban small producers dominating.</p>
<p>When cooperative economics spread to Germany, it appeared in another new enterprise form. Germany's industrial revolution lagged behind France by thirty or forty years. In order to compete with advanced capitalist countries, late-developing capitalist countries often sacrificed agriculture to subsidize the development of industry. Moreover, Germany was a country of small farmers, and it was particularly difficult for small-scale agriculture to adapt to capitalism. Therefore, after the development of capitalism in Germany, the most serious problem was the collapse of the rural economy and the poverty of farmers. As a result, cooperative economic enterprises also targeted rural areas and farmers, thus giving rise to agricultural cooperation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, if we abstractly explore the development path of cooperative economics, we can say that it starts from consumer cooperatives in England, goes through industrial cooperation in France, transitions through urban and rural credit cooperatives, and finally returns to agricultural cooperation in Germany.</p>
<p>In this transformation process, initially it targeted the working class, then the petty bourgeoisie, and finally the general public of farmers as its social foundation for development. Therefore, cooperative economics is actually a variable historical term. Although its meaning has not changed significantly in form from the past to the present, such as the democratic principle of one person, one vote, and the special dividend system, in essence, it has undergone significant evolution. The social significance of consumer cooperation is almost completely different from that of agricultural cooperation. This is a key point that we must grasp when studying cooperative economics. It is empty and without substance to only understand the form of cooperative economics. We must grasp the essence of cooperative economics in historical transformation. If we ignore the social foundation of cooperative economics and seek a meaning that is universally applicable to the past, present, and future, it is impossible to obtain it. In the past, some scholars grasped one aspect of the history of cooperative economic development and treated it as the whole picture, treating the principles of cooperative economics as a timeless and unchanging law that was not developed in real society but was deduced from Plato's ideal world and could be promoted to any corner of the world for thousands of years to come, so that the efficacy of cooperative economics was either exaggerated beyond the limits of appropriateness or constrained beyond the limits of need. For example, Charles Gide, the modern master of cooperative economics in France, only saw consumer cooperation and ignored industrial cooperation, and their theory could not explain agricultural cooperation based on farmers. Lassalle gave a reasonable explanation of industrial cooperation, but he also did not pay attention to agricultural cooperation. The above only abstractly points out the main process of transformation of cooperative economics. Of course, consumer cooperation is not limited to the working class, and industrial cooperation is not limited to France. That is only to point out its main or essential part.</p>
<p>The above is the conclusion drawn from the vertical development of cooperative economics. If we briefly examine its horizontal distribution, it is very obvious that although cooperative economics exists and develops in both capitalist metropolises and their colonies, there are extreme differences in the essence of cooperative economics. Even in the same metropole, there are some differences between advanced capitalist countries and backward capitalist countries. Generally speaking, consumer cooperative enterprises are more developed in advanced capitalist countries, while producer cooperative enterprises, especially agricultural cooperation, are more developed in backward capitalist countries. Although it is similar to backward capitalist countries in colonial and semi-colonial countries, with agricultural cooperation as the center, the latter is mostly spontaneous and exists as a social movement, while the former is often guided and exists as a social policy.</p>
<p>Although cooperative economics was initially a product of capitalist countries, as capitalism expands outward and domestic exploitation expands to internationalization, the problems caused by capitalism internally also appear in colonies in new forms. Therefore, although the content or essence of cooperative economics in colonies and metropolises is different, its origin—that it is an opposing thing produced by capitalist economics—is consistent. It must be added here that the cooperative economy in socialist countries, such as the cooperative organization in the Soviet Union, its origin and the historical tasks it undertakes are very different from the cooperative economy in capitalist countries (metropolises and colonies).</p>
<p>Secondly, in the early stages of cooperative economic development, especially in the cooperative program of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society, the world's first successful cooperative, the principle of political neutrality of cooperative economics was clearly declared. This principle has long been followed by cooperative entrepreneurs in various countries, but we have seen in the history of cooperative economic development in various countries that not only has the Cooperative Party been established in England, the birthplace of the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society, demonstrating that its cooperative economy has become extremely active in the political field, but since World War I, as a result of the development of agricultural cooperation, cooperative economic enterprises have gradually established close relationships with the government. Especially during World War II, consumer cooperation in some countries has become an agency for government rationing of materials. In the current stage of surging democratic movements, this democratic economy is putting on a new guise of political struggle along with the development of democratic politics. Although there is still a reflection of the pre-era objective environment in the theory of cooperative economics, in the practical process, the politically transcendent position of cooperative economics is no longer possible to maintain. Just as the era of free economic competition has been replaced by the monopoly of imperialism, liberalism has become a historical relic, and the political neutrality of cooperative economics is only a recollection of the past.</p>
<p>The Yellow River is About to Show Its Hand!</p>
<p>A Dispatch from Zhengzhou, by our reporter Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>The Yellow River's flood and the dike restoration project! This project includes whether or not the government and the CCP will cooperate! It is about to be decided. The time remaining before this decision is made is only a short two weeks. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has sounded the alarm regarding this imminent dangerous situation: it says that if the two sides do not cease military actions in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, not only will millions of farmers in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces suffer greatly, but the portions of the dike restoration work that have already been completed will also be completely destroyed. The matter is indeed this serious, because this flood, after the breaching of the Huayuankou dike, is the first time that the river is rushing towards its old dikes downstream, which have been neglected and collapsing for eight years. Any breach at any point could inundate millions of lives and countless acres of fertile land.</p>
<p>A Weak Link</p>
<p>Zhao Kou, fifty li downstream from Huayuankou, experienced a breach during the War of Resistance, and is still a weak link. It will of course be very easily breached first by the flood. Consequently, that section of the Longhai Railway will be flattened, and Kaifeng will be under threat. The situation is the same at Heigangbian, twenty-five li north of Kaifeng. Further on, at Dongbatou northwest of Lanfeng, which is where a breach occurred in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the former Qing dynasty, this severely damaged old scar is also a major target that the flood wishes to find an opening and attack. If it does, it will be able to relive its old dream of galloping through northern Jiangsu and flooding the Central Plains. (The elders of Jiangsu must remember clearly that they once raised funds to build a dike in that area.) According to a recent report from UNRRA advisor Todd after inspecting the situation along the downstream banks, the section between Linpuji and ShiliPu east of Changyuan is the most severely damaged, and a breach there could cause flooding to the north and south. Regardless of whether it is in government-controlled areas or CCP-controlled areas, all will be devoured by the flood. Also, the area around Jiyang is full of dangers, and it must be fully repaired before it can withstand the onslaught of the flood.</p>
<p>Worries About Two Regions</p>
<p>The examples listed above are the most serious and the most dangerous. There are also two regions that cannot help but cause concern: one is the triangular area near the river mouth. It is said that the dikes had already collapsed before the War of Resistance. Even if the dikes are to be restored this time, UNRRA is unable to provide assistance due to the principle of being limited to restoring the parts damaged during the war. This is something that we must complete ourselves. The other is the Qin River area upstream of Huayuankou. The Qin River is connected to the Yellow River, and the Yellow River's floodwaters can flow back into it. Currently, the north bank of that river is under the control of the Communist army. The Dafan and Laolongwan areas in Wu Zhi County within it were breached by the enemy during the War of Resistance, and were later repaired hastily by the local people. The Qiaoqiao and Wuchekou areas on the south bank (also in Wu Zhi County) were also breached during the war, although they have also been blocked. However, these two places are now only one meter above the water surface, and the dangerous situation is also unimaginable. Although there are no Communist troops in those two places, Qiujie, less than ten or twenty li to the west, is in the hands of the Communist army, and they can disrupt your construction at any time. If the Yellow River flood comes, Mulandian to the east of Wuzhi will have problems, and the several counties of northern Henan will inevitably be submerged.</p>
<p>Dangerous Works Along the North and South Banks</p>
<p>To talk about the dangerous works along the Yellow River bank, it would take three days and three nights to talk it all out, because the Yellow River has breached its dikes more than a thousand times in history. Just from the former Qing Dynasty onwards, the places where the dikes breached from Guangwu to Kaifeng were: on the north bank, Lizhuang (9th year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty), Modian (60th year of Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty), Jiaoying (14th year of Jiaqing of the Qing Dynasty and 60th year of Kangxi), and near Qibao (15th year of Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty and 16th year of Qianlong); on the south bank: Heyuantou (7th year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty), near Yangqiao (1st year of Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty and 26th year of Qianlong), Wan (1st year of Kangxi), near the east of Wannanyitou (6th year of Yongzheng), Xinzai (23rd year of Daoguang), Heigangkou (5th year of Xianfeng), and south of Yangzhuang (21st year of Daoguang).</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng Using the River to Kill</p>
<p>Time flies, we must not delay. According to the initial decision of the Yellow River Dike Restoration Joint Committee, the dike restoration project must be completed before July 15. There are only two weeks left until now. This committee includes two representatives from the CCP. Although time is pressing, it should still proceed smoothly. However, in recent days, Liu Bocheng's five columns have suddenly moved from northern Henan to the Yellow River bank in the area south of Xinxiang County, which has cast a dark cloud over the hearts of those concerned about the Yellow River dike restoration. If Liu Bocheng really uses the Yellow River's water to kill people, everyone must punish him to appease the Yellow River.</p>
<p>There was no major drought upstream of the Yellow River last year, and there has been no torrential rain this spring. Currently, the Yellow River's water level only has a flow of 2,000 cubic meters per second (a major flood can reach 15,000 or 16,000), which are all things that allow one to feel slightly relieved. However, experts all believe that these dilapidated old dikes downstream are like a veteran soldier who has been discharged for a long time, without the ability to resist the elite troops of the flood. Now, the only hope is to injure limbs and not harm the heart and lungs.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<p>Remembering S. by Fengjia</p>
<p>I accidentally learned from an article in a certain newspaper that S. had died somewhere. According to the author, this is just a rumor, but he has no information to prove that the rumor is unfounded. "S. is not dead." That's how I hope it is in my worldview, but "human affairs are vague, although I can guess," I know that this is just a comforting thought. If S. were to unfortunately die, although he would be getting what he wanted, his friends would inevitably feel endless sorrow.</p>
<p>I first met S. in the late spring of 1937.</p>
<p>One slightly depressing noon, my classmate Z. and I left school, preparing to take a train to the Shanghai concession, a journey that would take less than 20 minutes. As we boarded the train car, Z. noticed two acquaintances there and went over to chat with them, then introduced them to us. One of them was gentle and refined, wearing glasses and a brown suit, looking about 23 or 24 years old. That was A. M. The other was about the same age, wearing a long robe, a worn French hat, and carrying a walking stick. His lips were thick and slightly upturned, and his face showed a stubborn expression. That was S. At that time, the literary world was advocating national defense literature, and the poets in Shanghai were brewing the organization of a national poetry group, so we chatted about this topic for a while. After the train arrived in Shanghai, we parted ways.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that both S. and A. M. were alumni of our school, so when we first met them in a teahouse, it unconsciously eliminated a lot of restraint. During this period, I met A. M. more often. S. stayed in Shanghai for a very short time before returning to Wuhan to resume his civil servant career.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1938, S. returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong (he had retreated to Hong Kong when Wuhan fell). At this time, this so-called "isolated island" of Shanghai was "licentious and shameless on the one hand, and serious work on the other," but most liberal intellectuals lacked the courage and determination to confront reality. To go with the flow would be against their conscience, so they could only make a living in contradiction and distress. Some of our friends were more or less of this kind. But S.'s return added some vitality to everyone.</p>
<p>S. was a good conversationalist. When we were together, he was almost always the only one talking. While smoking, he would talk eloquently in his low, nasal voice about what he had seen and heard in the rear, and when he got excited, he would often burst out laughing himself.</p>
<p>Not long after S. returned to Shanghai, he became one of the active figures in the literary world. He was simultaneously editing two literary magazines, constantly writing articles, and attending some group lectures or giving guidance. After his efforts, the Shanghai Poetry Workers Association was established in the summer of 1939. It published the journal "Row" and printed a batch of palm-sized books, making a considerable contribution to the poetry movement in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although not entirely, it was partly due to overwork that S.'s originally weak body became increasingly worse. He coughed up blood several times, and his face always looked pale. He was not willing to rest; drinking, smoking, sitting in cafes late at night, sometimes not sleeping all night.</p>
<p>I remember once at V.'s house. It was a late spring night, the room was heated, everyone had finished talking, but no one wanted to leave, sitting motionless and silent, perhaps everyone was contemplating something, chewing on something. Gradually, the candles on the table turned to ashes, the red fire also turned dim, until it went out. A loud bugle call came from the nearby British barracks. Dawn rose, and we felt a wave of fatigue and went to sleep on the floor in V.'s house, wrapped in quilts.</p>
<p>We often lived this kind of life, which undoubtedly had a very bad effect on S.'s health. Some of us tried to persuade him to stop, but he didn't take it to heart. When he coughed up blood, he would be careful for a few days, but after that, everything would be back to normal.</p>
<p>In the early winter of 1939, I left Shanghai. After that, I never saw S. again, and we never exchanged letters. Only in the summer of 1940, from P., who had just come to the interior from Shanghai, did I learn a little about his recent situation: his health was still very bad, but he was working even harder in literary activities.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1942, Mr. and Mrs. HY wrote from Suzhou, mentioning that S. was immersed in writing "The Biography of Jesus" in the low pressure of the "isolated island." At that time, I imagined that his state of mind must be very lonely, but loneliness might be a good exercise for him!</p>
<p>Later, I learned from the newspaper that he had gone to a certain place in Jiangnan. And I also read some of his writings filled with fighting will. Soon FV also went there. In order to go to Rome, these friends who had always had very few things in common in their thinking but were close as brothers finally embarked on the same road.</p>
<p>However, the bad news came that S. had been sacrificed. Was S. really sacrificed? Looking east at the clouds and mountains, my grief is boundless! On this day when his death has not been fully confirmed, I wish him good health! (Sent from Chengdu, June 26)</p>
<p>Ruth and Naomi by Kerderming</p>
<p>A poem about Ruth set in a Hebrew village is familiar to people in Europe and America. Scholars have not yet found out who wrote the poem and who the characters are. One passage in the poem is roughly: "Let me not leave you, and do not turn back as I follow you: for where you go, I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your friends will be my friends; your God will be my God." This passage can fully illustrate this painting. Kerderming's name first appeared on the list of the Academy of Arts in 1853. His ancestors were Spanish. He was born in Botes in 1833. He enrolled in London in his youth. In 1850, he studied at the Leys School and later entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He joined the Royal Academy of Arts in 1867 and passed away in 1898.</p>
<p>Lights by Huang Yun</p>
<p>Travelers love lights.</p>
<p>In the darkness, how much they yearn for lights.</p>
<p>When I was young, I used to listen to my grandmother telling stories about travelers and lights with her dry lips. A light in the darkness will guide travelers out of the maze.</p>
<p>I also remembered seeing the lighthouse far away in the sea on a ship, which was a guidepost for the route.</p>
<p>So lights gave me a deep impression. I saw the little moths flying around the green lamp, they loved the light so much, even though they died in the light.</p>
<p>I also have infinite love for the street lights. Whenever I walk on the night road, I silently count the dim yellow street lights, letting the faint light shine on my steps, guiding me all the way to my destination.</p>
<p>I often think this way: humans are travelers in this world, but the lights in the darkness are so stingy to emit light.</p>
<p>In this dark journey, there are many hearts that pray for the light of lights; a light burning in human hearts.</p>
<p>Some people say that the world is too dark, probably because there are no lights.</p>
<p>Inscription on Ma Gongyu's Painting of Riding a Tiger by Zhang Daqian</p>
<p>Huang Gong of the East Sea exhausted his incantations, but my brother is particularly skilled in this art. I envy you for being a sculptor as well, once calling out to Xiao Kong in Hualin. The immortal riding the tiger has gone and not returned, and old friends weep (when my late brother Shanzhi passed away, you had a long poem lamenting him); for ten years I have dreamed of the road to Wumen, leaving the essence of gold for the world to see.</p>
<p>The French Writers Association by P. Taija, translated by Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>According to the association's charter, the long-established French Writers Association (Société des Gens de Lettres) is about to convene a general meeting of its members to re-elect some of the directors and discuss the modernization of the writing profession. I once told my colleagues in the association that in this day and age, the tragedy of Chatterton (translator's note: an 18th-century English poet) committing suicide in poverty would not occur, because if he were alive today, he could have insurance.</p>
<p>From 1939 to 1945, the association's organization underwent many changes, and its main purpose was to protect the spiritual and material rights and interests of its members. Its business is expanding day by day. In 1944, when France was liberated, the association was able to attract the attention of the authorities even more, because its members were able to promote culture and support major causes for the country. From October 1944 to February 1946, Mr. Zhao Ru Le Gongtuo resumed his post as chairman, which made the Masha Mansion—the association's headquarters—restore its former appearance, forgetting the nightmares of the fallen era. From February 1946 to March 1947, Madame Jia Mi'er Jiapu succeeded him as chairman, who was intelligent and capable and made many achievements, making the association's own cause cooperate with the national construction plan, effectively safeguarding the dignity of writers and the freedom of writing.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Le Gongtuo's idealism and Madame Jiapu's realism, the association's mission can be further expanded, and the directors are more willing to work hard. Gérard Bauer is the most popular candidate to succeed Madame Jiapu as chairman and can be called the support of the entire body of members.</p>
<p>In the French literary world, the position of chairman of the Writers Association is very lofty, like a "marshal" in the military. We only need to look at who has been the chairman since its establishment (1838) to understand its importance: initially there were: Villemain (translator's note: critic), Balzac (major novelist), Hugo (the greatest poet of the Romantic School), François Arago (great scientist), Vigny (poet), etc.; closer to us there are: Marcel Prevost (novelist), Paul Hervieu (playwright), Victor Margueritte (novelist), René Doumic (lifetime secretary of the Académie Française), Pierre de Courcel (critic), Edmond Haraucourt (poet), Charles Le Goffic (novelist), Édouard Estaunié (novelist), Pierre Benoit (novelist), Gaston Deschamps (critic), François Mauriac (novelist), Zhao Ru Guamel (novelist),... almost the entire Académie Française has moved in. Because, for a long time, being the chairman of the Writers Association has been the prelude to being elected as a member of the Académie Française—although the chairman himself has no intention of this.</p>
<p>After this list of famous figures, Mr. Gérard Bauer's name will undoubtedly be added.</p>
<p>When talking about one's friends, it is best to cite a famous precedent. In his "Memoirs of a Recluse," Lucien Taijafu (translator's note: he is the father of the author of this article, Pierre Taijafu) has a very vivid chapter describing Henri Poedo: "A great journalist, never a lackey of anyone," and said: "In the newspaper, he (Henri) fought frankly," "He promoted the younger generation, protected wronged celebrities, and made them hope to rekindle and regain vitality." If the older generation respects and loves each other so much, readers probably will not blame Lucien Gu Jiafu's son for praising Henri Podo's son, saying that he is: the most wonderful representative of French wisdom, especially the ever-changing Parisian spirit. Having been influenced by the master Clemenceau (translator's note: that is, "Tiger Prime Minister," a famous journalist), Mr. Gérard Bauer is a famous journalist, ethicist, and essayist. He once said: "Wasting my time to observe everything: this is my hobby, and probably what I do best." That's right, his time is wasted, but it saves our time, and he faithfully records our time.</p>
<p>Memory by Jiang Ye</p>
<p>Time takes away people's youth; but it cannot take away people's memories. "A person's heart suffers an injury, and it will always hurt." People's memories are all bitter. My youth was not beautiful at all. A wandering life of destitution occupied most of my youth. I wandered, I was poor, I was sick, I lived like a stray dog.</p>
<p>But I cherish my memories. Because even in the most difficult times, I never succumbed to life. I didn't crawl over like a lower animal. I stood up, fell down; when I fell down, I stood up again. In the days of suffering, I struggled one step at a time. When a beautiful dream encounters harsh reality and is shattered, I will sit down silently alone, or take a walk outdoors, reviewing the bitterness of my memories. Immersed in bitter memories, my heart suddenly becomes young again.</p>
<p>One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood 334 by Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This is about to turn back to the item of a spy's stereotyped appearance. On the headquarters' registered dossier file, there must be a footnote, and there must be a name; this name must designate a stereotyped substitute name; however, the words explaining this name and footnote are not very short. If it is too short, it is easy to cause ambiguity, and if it is not short, it cannot meet the condition of "affirmative clarity" in secret instructions.</p>
<p>He Jian can be said to be an expert in this work. In addition to learning, he also has many years of experience, so he classified and summarized the stereotyped appearance into fifteen departments; the first to eighth types are for general social appearances, and the ninth to fifteenth types are for military appearances; the numbers are also determined, what the first number is, what social type it should be, what password, what route, what posture, what action. Therefore, in secret instructions, only the number needs to be specified. The person in charge who receives the order, regardless of whether he has seen this person before, can find it with a single search, without any errors. All reports and records can also be simplified, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>This time when I went to Tianjin to work and sing this big show, I used the "Fifteenth" stereotype, that is, my pseudonym "professional" - the comrade of the senior secretary and external affairs officer of the Military Intelligence Special Department came to me, and according to this route, with a password, I could find me.</p>
<p>(According to the method stipulated by He Jian on that day, there were also comprehensive numbers and organic changes, which will not be explained here because they are not important to the text).</p>
<p>That night, after using the "Fifteenth" posture to</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly soft, with occasional slight declines. The guild made adjustments, but Peruvian sugar saw the largest drop, initially at $665,000, then $645,000, a decrease of about $20,000. Second-grade medium white sugar fell from $610,000 to $600,000, a small decrease of $10,000. Taiwanese red sugar fell from $570,000 to $565,000. Second-fourth grade coarse white sugar was at $685,000 to $690,000. Fourth-grade half-refined white sugar initially went from $630,000 to $638,000, then to $620,000, a small decrease of $20,000. Native sugar remained largely unchanged. Shantou green sugar was at $423,000 to $420,000, cotton red sugar was at $470,000, and Hainan red sugar was at $460,000, with less than 100 bags traded. Xinghua white sugar was particularly high, at $590,000, then $570,000. Xinghua red sugar was at $470,000 to $450,000, with several hundred baskets traded, showing a slight recovery. Diaozhou green sugar was at $380,000, and ordinary sugar was at $376,000, with slightly under 300 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Active Export of Green Tea – Wenzhou Hasting to Quote Prices</h3>
<p>Among export green teas, categories like "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" have historically found their largest market in French Africa. Yesterday, the market trend suddenly became active, the reason being the resurgence of rumors regarding the opening of trade there. Furthermore, local tea exporters are considering moving their inventories of old tea from 1946, leading to growing optimism. Holders are asking for higher prices than before, resulting in a noticeable rise in prices. Other varieties remain unasked for. However, new Wenzhou black tea of this year, after active negotiations, has been quoted for sale, with top-grade tea reportedly at $900,000 per dan (a unit of weight), and mid-grade tea at $720,000 per dan, which are considered stable prices. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, due to the approaching peak season, demand is improving, and prices are very strong.</p>
<h3>American and British Cigarettes Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw mixed attitudes from various parties, with moderate trading volume. Huacheng Company released 10,000 packs of "Golden Rat" cigarettes, starting at $220 per pack, using 350 "cards" (likely referring to a distribution system), with 125 "A cards" and 50 "C cards" utilized. Furthermore, the Da Zhonghua Tobacco Company released "Horseshoe" brand cigarettes at $30,000 per pack, with each reseller receiving 25 packs, tightening the cash flow among dealers and leading to slow trading.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, American and British cigarettes saw more active trading. Ten-packs of British American Tobacco cigarettes rose by $70,000 compared to the previous day, reaching $7,430,000. "Old Gold" cigarettes also rose by $30,000, reaching $6,430,000. "555" cigarettes also showed a slight increase. Among Chinese cigarettes, "Beautiful Golden Rat," "Great Kles," "Golden Dragon," and high-grade "Great South Gate," and "San Pao Tai" cigarettes showed weakness. Other brands like "Bank," "Red Man," and "Crusader" cigarettes rebounded by $100 to $2,000. American brands like "Lucky Strike," "Camel," and "Marlboro" remained stable due to limited supply. [Another Report] Many 50-cigarette tins recently returned to the market as gift returns from the Dragon Boat Festival. Stores have taken in many, causing inventory to swell and demand to soften, putting downward pressure on the market. "Gallico" cigarettes were last priced at $56,500 per tin, down $1,500. "3-5" brand cigarettes also fell by $2,000, to $48,000. Other white tin-packaged cigarettes such as "Little San Pao," and "Sailor" brands all fell by $500 to $800.</p>
<h3>Tight Money Supply in the Market - Significant Deficits for National Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the settlement of the six bottom banks, the money supply in the market has not eased. In the clearing house, on the 3rd, national banks had a total deficit of 15.3 billion yuan, foreign banks had a deficit of 25.4 billion yuan, directly exchanging commercial banks had a deficit of 4.11 billion yuan, while agent exchanging banks after number 50 had a total surplus of 44.8 billion yuan. Yesterday, national banks had a deficit of 40 billion yuan, foreign banks had a deficit of 6.6 billion yuan, directly exchanging commercial banks had a surplus of 5.4 billion yuan, and banks after number 50 had a surplus of 41.2 billion yuan. It is said that loans from commercial banks to national banks and foreign banks must be repaid due to the authorities' account checks, resulting in large deficits in recent days. In addition, the payment of funds from the public subscription of US dollar bonds, various taxes, and the sale of yarn and cloth from the textile industry are the main reasons for the large deficits of national banks. Therefore, in the past two days, smaller banks and outside the industry circles have felt the tightness of funds, and shadow interest rates have hovered between 21% and 25%.</p>
<h3>Solution to Fuel Oil Supply Problem for Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>The local shipping industry previously faced a shortage of fuel oil due to the limited import quotas and the sharp increase in demand, which affected water transportation. The industry association sent representatives to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation, calling for relief and increased quotas. Subsequently, China Petroleum Corporation, together with local American-Asia Petroleum and Texas Petroleum companies, discussed a unified supply plan, jointly published notices, and asked all shipping companies and factories powered by oil engines to register their oil demand with the company's Shanghai office before May 17. It is now known that the survey of fuel oil needs for the shipping industry has been completed. A total of 34 shipping companies, including Minsheng Company, have registered in the city, with 51 vessels, including Tianlong, requiring a total of 17,444 tons of fuel oil per month. The oil companies will allocate the supply according to the import quota ratio and supply capacity. Asia Petroleum will supply 6,825 tons, Mobil 5,181 tons, Texaco 2,729 tons, and China Petroleum Corporation 2,709 tons, and sales have already begun. Therefore, the fuel oil supply problem for ships has been temporarily and reasonably resolved.</p>
