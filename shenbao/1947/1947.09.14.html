<h3>宣方全文</h3>
<p>〔中央肚南京十三日電〕中國國民黨第六屆中央執行委員會第四次全體會議及中央黨團聯席會議宣言，原文如下：</p>
<p>本黨自總理領導國民革命以來，所祖負的是中國歷史的使命，每逢國家民族有重大歷史使命付給本黨的時候，本黨必有一次新的檢討。新的團結，形成新的陣容，以担負這新的使命。</p>
<p>總理在民國紀元前將興中會改組爲同盟會，結果是中華民國的誕生，民國三年，改組國民黨爲中華革命黨，結果是推翻袁世凱帝制，重建和平，十三年改組中國國民黨，結果是掃蕩軍閥，完成北閥統一的大業，二十七年本黨的臨時全國代表大會的各項重大決策，和三民主義靑年團的產生，更光榮的達到八年多艱苦抗戰的勝利，現在歷史上又將第二次世界大戰後戡亂建國的重大責任付與本黨，於是本黨有此次黨團統一組織的決定，這種措施，是秉承總理過去改進革命組織的經騐，團結同志，集中力量，統一指揮，重建革命的基礎，加强黨的思想領導，發揚黨的革命精神，以共赴此非常艱鉅的事功，而達成後期革命的任務。</p>
<p>過去五十年的歷史昭示我們，本黨推翻專制，締造民國，掃除軍閥，取消不平等條約，完成抗戰勝利等項重大史實，對於民族，民權兩主義，是顯然的重大成就，歷年來建立各級民意機關，與最近頒布憲法，結束訓政，更足以表示本黨一貫努力，不斷前進，以完成民主政治的決心與誠意，而戡亂與總動員，乃是爲了維護國家領土主權的統一和完整，這正是民族生存與世界和平的一關鍵，至於民生主義的實現，原一爲本黨革命的主要目的，解除民一衆生活的痛苦，是目前迫切的需一要，以前關於民生的建設，本來成就較少，而八年的抗戰，與戰後的毀亂和破壞，更覺殘損無餘，所以民生主義的經濟建設，實應重新開始，而且刻不容緩，一切建設事業，尤應首先盡其在我，本黨願以此爲當前努力奮鬥的目標。</p>
<p>我們認識目前革命環境的困難，但是我們同時也要認識我們革命的力量，實在比以前任何革命階段爲雄厚，以前我們薄弱的革命勢力，尙能克服每一階段的困難，此後我們祗要我們自尊而不自大，自反而不自餒，自信而不自滿，定能由歷史的成例來保設我們達到預期的目的。</p>
<p>我們要了解，不能自强不息的不是革命政黨，經不起誣蔑，忍不住煎熬的，更不是革命黨員，我們願以黨的團結和奮鬥，促進黨的新生，以黨的新生，創造革命的動力，以革命的動力，達成政治經濟的全面改革。</p>
<p>我們體會二千年前中國「爲政不在多言顧力行何如耳」的古訓，此後我們願意拿事實來答復期望，拿行動來證明決心。</p>
<p>我們要不惜爲保障民族生存而犧牲，爲實行民主憲政而奮鬥，爲改善人民生活而勞力。</p>
<p>國家已向憲政時期邁進，但是保障中華民國，維護中華民族的責任，是本黨和本黨同志義不容辭的，我們願以此自勉互勉，更願全國同胞本着我們共同的國家觀念，民族意識，一齊和我們提携，共同建設我們三民主義的新中國。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕軍吏督察團今又破獲巨案。保綏署少將高級參謀苑崇　及敵僞產業處理局第三組長趙英達被捕。苑崇榖於勝利後來平任斯職，曾先後以何王惠名義冒領敵產住屋三所，價値五十餘金條。近經督察團密査此三所住房皆爲日商東洋紡織公司產業，其中一所爲日入假何王惠名字購得，苑則聲稱何王惠乃其妻，淪陷時期（民廿八年）購得此房產，後被日人强佔，請求處理局發還。處理局即照聲請發還。督察團根據密告査悉內情後，今日派警憲將苑逮捕，苑力作辯護拒捕，但未倖免，而所謂何王惠者迄未査出住址。苑被捕後稱：何乃其原配妻，已回東北原籍濱江，現妻乃「抗戰夫人」莊友靑云云，故判定所謂何王惠者實無其人。督察團認爲處理局如此「發還」敵產，實有舞弊凟職重嫌，乃將苑送行轅軍法處法辦，同時將趙英達解送法院。</p>

<h3>權威人士談對日和會　應注意表決方式　「四國民意權」為最適當</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕某權成人士十三日與記者淡對日和約問題時，對和會表決權一點，認爲應堅決主張維持聯合國憲章之原案，即四大國同意權，亦即所謂一國否決權。據稱：對日和約關俘我國最近之發展及將來之存亡，實較任何國爲大，條約中如有一條一項妨碍我國之發展，危害我國之生存，我即不能同意，非經我國同意，和約即不能成立。美國所提議英國康白拉會議所贊同之三分之二表決權制，第一違反聯合國憲章，第二我國勢孤力單，不似英美系國家與國之多，不能不預防參加和會各國因利書不同，痛癢不關，而作不利於我國之表決。我人爲擁護憲章保障我利益，應不避與蘇聯一致之嫌，而堅決主張四大國同意權，即一國否決權。至於傳說我國提議修正美國建議爲「三分之二表決權但須有三大國之同意」一層，亦太冒險。萬一英·美·蘇因利害一致，而犧牲我國時，豈不作法自斃？舉一現實例子，我人主張日本工業水準以一九二八至一九三〇年爲標準，而蘇則主以一九三〇至一九三四年爲標準，此與美國主張相一致，故吾人萬不能作此冒險建議。此外，渠又主張我人應堅決主張廢除日本天皇制，對日本領土，主張照開羅宣言及波次坦協定之規定劃定其本土範圍。至於本土附近島嶼，則應以麥帥總部一九四六年一月廿九日命令所規定日本行政權行使之各島嶼爲最大限度，而劃定其範圍。關於日本賠償問題，渠認爲應以鮑萊所擬日本賠償計劃爲最低限度。</p>

<h3>白部長在四中全會　軍事報告全文（二續）</h3>
<p>（五）徽兵設施之改善；兵役在他國本爲內政事項，而我國現時仍爲軍政要端，亦爲本部與人民關係至爲密切之事，本部對之特加審眞。茲將關於兵役業務之改進，及「動員戡亂時期徴兵設施之改善」，略述之如下：（一）修訂兵役法規，由二百三十三種整理修訂成二十四種，以成一有系統而完善之兵役法規。（二）調整兵役機構，三十四年四月，舊師團管區一律撤消，凖備成立若干新師管區及團管區，至本年八月底止，除匪區外，已成立師管區五十七個，團警區一八一個，軍管區原十七個，現增設蘇魯兩省軍管區二個，共十九個。（三）改進管區人事，在中訓團設兵役研究班，已辦三期，共畢業將級上校級學員六二六人，分派洛管區擔任高級工作。（四）徴兵況，平均配賦，配賦比例，佔人口數千分之一點五。（五）實施正常徽兵，徵集年滿二十歲者一個年次爲標準，如不足時，再延伸年次，但以不超過二十五歲爲止，除特種地區特種部隊外，嚴禁擅自招募。（六）各大都市免緩人數較多，故儘先徴集志願兵，不足時再行徴集。（七）增加徴集費，每人為三萬元，安家費每人為五萬元，並發動地方籌集優待金穀。（八）營地由各管區及地方政府或修或建，或利用祠堂廟宇，禁止露宿及強駐民房。（九）新兵按爭配發服裝，並施行官乓保育競賽及虐待檢舉。因是本年徽兵，尚見順利，配額之徴集，達百分之九十九強，途中逃亡疾病，佔百分之二弱。</p>
<p>（六）第二綫兵團之建立，依據總動員令，除充實第一綫兵國外，仍須積極建立第二綫丘團，經擬定辦法，分別實施中。</p>
<p>（七）地方自衛武器之加强，本部對於培養地方武力，素甚重視，迄本年六月止，先後撥發全國各省地方團隊及警察武器，計步槍，輕重機槍，及其他手機槍，手槍，擲彈筒，迫砲等，爲數甚多。撥發原則，除各地區民衆自衛隊盡量利用民間槍枝，並按其實際需要，酌撥彈藥與俘獲武器外，對各省保安團隊武器，以按編制數撥足爲準。實際上，重要省份早已撥足，次要省份亦充實百分之六十以上，業經檢討策定補充計劃，預期於本年下半年度實施完成。</p>
<p>（八）分配日艦之處理：自日本投降後，所有日本軍艦，均經盟國解除武裝，其中戰艦，航空母艦，以及潛水艇，均經美國沉毀，自驅逐艦以下，則由中美英蘇平均分配，以抽籤法決定之，我國得到第一第二第三批各得八艘，共廿四艘。惟此次接收之日艦，多係戰時出品，構造均較簡陋，且所有武器及電信設備等，於日本投降時，遭全部破壞，現一部份已經修理完整，一部正在裝修中，一俟完工，即行編隊服役。　丙關於制度之推行</p>
<p>制度為建軍之基礎，百年之大計，目前雖置重在剿匪，但亦未忽視將來，故仍注意建立制度，加緊推行，以奠立國軍永久基礎。茲舉重要數端如左</p>
<p>（一）人事制度：人事制度之革新，在配合整軍戡亂，剔除舊習，以期提高國軍幹部之素質，增加國軍作戰之力量。茲錄舉如左：一·分層負責：過去國軍人事，所有官役考績獎懲，概由軍委會集中辦理，控制雖嚴，考核難問，本部成立後，爲實事求是，加强各級權責，改用分層負責制，制定陸海空軍人事業務職掌劃分辦法，本部僅作員額分配與官位控制，及將官之任免考續獎懲，上校以下人員職務之調轉及考績等，授權陸海空軍各總司令部及行轅綏署主任與軍師長辦理，事後呈報備案。又退除役制度，爲保持軍隊朝氣之最　辦法，不但使當備軍各級幹部不斷新陳代謝，以提高素質士氣，且可儲備大批條備軍官，俾戰時補充容易，故本部成立後排除萬難，力求此良好制度之實施。（未究）</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>「今日」與「中國」</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>胡樸安先生晚年常常提倡一個口號：『立於今日之點讀中國古書；立於中國之點讀外國書！」</p>
<p>這個口號，他經常在談話中提起，也曾寫在文章裏。這是他經過七十年的研究思案所得的一個成果。</p>
<p>我和樸老相處稍久，而相處又甚爲相得，到底只是因爲兩個人的思想相同的緣故而已。而我們倆的思想中心，可以說就是上面他所提倡的一句口號。</p>
<p>他這句口號是講如何讀書。讀書的意義原來包括得極廣的。如其說得抽象一點，便可這麼說法：「站在時代的尖端，研究固有的學術思想以及文物制度；站在民族的立塲，研究世界的思潮以及各國的文物制度。」要是這樣說法，便可適用於一般而成爲一種主張。這便是胡先生的主張，也就是我們倆的主張。</p>
<p>目前一般學者對於時代與民族的關係，所發抒的見解，常常不能作持平之論，而偏於一端：强調時代的人把民族一脚踢開不要；强調民族的人又把時代丟了。其實時代與民族的關係，正像一個十字架般交叉着的，而我們就生活在這十字架的交义點上：我們既丟不掉民族，也拋不開時代的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>胡先生在「樸安主義」一文中說：『立脚於現在之點讀古書，時時事事反諸身心而馬行之。禮記中庸曰，「上仲尼祖述堯舜，憲軍文試，上律天時，下襲水土。」祖述堯舜者，守聖賢之道德也；憲軍文試者，遵國家之法律也；上律天時者，知有時間也；下要水土者，知有空間也。守道德而邀法律，不爲　家之迁腐；遵法律而守道德，不爲法家之刻薄。處空間而知有時間，不爲現代中國之古代人；在時間不忘記空間，不爲中國現代之外國人。』</p>
<p>最後兩句說得最爲透澈，也是最切中時弊的了。現在我們不妨先就時間一點，再來解釋一下。</p>
<p>時間是像一條斬不斷的綫，無限地綿延着的。現在包孕在過去之中，而過去也就遺留在現在之內。只是人類的生活是跟着時代的進展而逐步進化着的。最初是石器，其後是銅器，後來是鐵器，現在是應用原子了。石器在石器時代原爲最好的利器。我們讀美石器時代的石器，原屬無妨；但覺得石器時代的石器已經盡善盡美，而就不要銅器，鐵器以至於原子，那就大大的錯誤了。因爲我們今日既已進步到原子的階段了，石器便只能成爲博物館裏的古董，再也不能作爲利器用的了。一切學術制度思想文藝，雖則不同於工具，然也總跟着時代而進步的，過去的學術制度思想文藝不管如何美好，因爲時代演進，總有不適於時代的地方的，凡已不適合於時代的，自宜拋掉，不必保留。可惜一般讀古書的人，對於古書內容，毫無條件地一概接受，並且就想把古書中的一切應用於當代，那就大錯了。樸安先生在他儒家修養法一文中，教人讀書的方法道：「做書本上學間，以疑爲入手。疑有二：一疑書，二疑理。疑書者，板本之錯興記載之錯也。疑理者，解說之誤會與時代之變易也。」</p>
<p>他主張立脚於現在之點讀古書，就是呌讀古書的人不要忘記現在是什麼時代，而一無批判選擇，就把古書中的一切，一古腦兒囫圇吞棗地接收下來。古書是要讀的，是必需讀的。不讀古書，便不知道我們國家社會的蹤跡，思想學術發展的路徑。但讀古書定要戴上時代的眼鏡，站在今日的時代去批評古代文物制度等等的短長，方可有所選擇，而收爲今日之用。况且從前中國閉關自守，本國的學術思想還可靠傳統的力量統制本國；現在交通發達，天下一家，世界各國的學術思想文物制度滾滾而來，就要排斥抵制，也有所不能的了。所以從今日之點讀中國古書，說得詳細一點，就是要把今日世界各國的學術思想來和中國的學術思想做個比較：看看中國的學術思想，那幾種已經不適於今日的了，就放開一邊；那幾種還是勝過人家的，幷且還極適用於今日的，那就極力發揚光大一下。一言以蔽之：時間催逼着中國要現代化，讀書人也必需要現代化，萬萬不要做書中人，而變爲現代中國的古代人。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>時間催逼着中國必需現代化，自屬毫無疑義。然而「現代化」並不就是等於一外國化」——旣不是「蘇聯化」，也不是「美國化」，也不是「英國化」恰恰相反，而是將蘇聯英美等國世界上一切現代的文物制度等，選擇吸收過來，以配合中國民族的環境歷史，換言之，就是吸收現代的適合於中國的文物制度學術思想爲己用，而變成爲「中國的」文物制度學術思想。但是今日談現代化者，常常忘記這個道理。看見美國成功，就想把美國的一切，不論好歹，都搬來中國實行，所可惜的中國月亮總不能變成爲美國月亮而已。看見蘇聯成功了，便想把蘇聯一切，不論好歹，都搬到小國來實行，自己喝了伏特加的燒酒，擔了高爾基的招牌，穿了繡花襯衫，還覺得不够蘇聯化，只想南京變爲英斯科，上海天氣要冷得像列寧格勒才好。於是我們在學校中，在街頭上，只看見靈魂已入蘇聯籍的，或者英美籍的中國人，而不見一個眞正的中國人了。以至於爲了蘇聯的民主與英美的民主不同，我們這種蘇職籍的同胞便在戰塲上，興兵作亂，在後方刊物上會塲上也拚命作「理論的鬥爭」冷預定了一套理論來硬裝未來的事實。戰鬥的慘烈無以復加，然而此種「中國現代之外國人」竟死而不悟，甚至死而無怨！</p>
<p>假使今日中國，人人能處空間而知有時間，不爲現代中國之古代人；在時間不忘記空間，不爲中國現代之外國人，人人做個現代的中國人，中國的現代人；那末今日中國的內亂必然立刻就可平靖，中國的一切現代建設必然立刻就可以進行，和平康樂的境界，必然立刻就開始進人於中國了！</p>

<p>〔合衆視域不京十三日電〕日首相片山十三日宣稱：渠之社會黨內閣準備以眞正日本人民代表姿態，出席和會，請求各國對於日本民主化之努力，表示信任。片山自六月一日出任首相後，今日爲首次舉行招待記者會。渠稱：「吾人將盡力使日本成爲民主國家。吾人所關切者爲日本之未來，而非日本過去之錯誤，但吾人將禁止一切易引起他國誤會之行動。」渠稱：政府將努力選擇一批明瞭新民主方法，獲得勞工信任，以及深悉日本社會與文化問題之代表團，參加和會。目前局勢，尚未屆選擇此項代表團之時。惟在招待會結束時，在社會黨內佔重要勢力之內閣書記長西尾，由片山首相指名爲日本和會之當然代表人選。西尾稱：代表團應提供保蹬，「不再引起糾紛與不再挑起戰爭。」並謂社會黨並不反對容納反對黨人選於代表團內，但堅稱：片山內閣自爲最合理之人選。片山笑稱：西尾之推選渠本人，頗出渠之意外，但渠對此事暫保留評論。片山承認風聞有一新保守黨之組織，其目的爲應付和會，但渠認爲實無必要。渠雖並未指名道姓，然渠顯係指前相吉田而言。片山稱：渠對中國如無蘇聯參加將不出席和會，並反對個別締和之消息，不願有所評論。僅稱：「中日爲歷史有相互關係之鄰國，中國當然對日本能有深切了解。」</p>
<p>渠稱：渠及其政府，關於日本和平時期所需之最低條件，尚未向各盟國提出建議。渠在和約簽字後，日本究需何種形式之管制，不準備提出討論。又關於條約，日本並無提出建讓之資格，但願遵守盟國行動。渠稱：日本內閣熱烈希望和約能由所有十一個有關國家簽字。</p>
<p>渠同時關於內政發表下列各點：（一）在三個半月內，實現其黑市統制政策。渠估計經營黑市者已减少達以前三分之一之人數。政府緊急經濟復興計劃業已見效，物價已有下降趨勢。（二）由於盟國救濟之故，食糧前途已有顯著改善。政府正在制定新穀物徵收及主要食糧分配計劃，於十一月實施。（三）關於內閣經濟集中權排除案之最後修訂，預定於九月十六日通過內閣，提交議會。</p>

<h3>美軍航空部發表　艾其森罹難原因</h3>

<h3>召集聯大美代表團會議　馬歇爾指示策略　限制大國否決權必遭蘇聯反對</h3>

<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十二日電〕馬歇爾準備於下週演說兩次，第一次演說將於星期日夜，對美國聯合國協會之全國性聯合國慶祝週發表；第二次則於星期三對大會經常會議發表。馬歇爾預料將於此兩次演說中，綜述美國對於聯合國大會之政策，而馬歇爾親自出任美代表團團長之事實，亦可視爲美國於批評聯合國行動緩慢以後，加强其對於聯合國支特之證明。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十三日電〕消息靈通方面稱，蘇聯在本屆聯大會中，將反對限制否決權之任何企圖，並將譴責美國在印尼及朝鮮之政策。關於朝鮮部份，蘇聯將提出長篇文件，依據莫洛托夫最近致馬歇爾之照會，控訴美當局之摧殘民主份十。此外蘇聯對印度之控訴南非歧視印人，必能予以强力支持。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕歐洲經濟會議今夜宣布，該會將進行研究成立歐洲關稅同盟，由關係各國放棄經濟獨立以謀共同福利。同盟各國間應取消關稅，保持完全自由貿易，並對同盟以外各國，採取一種共同關稅政策。蘇聯等十五國亦將被邀參加研究工作，此舉足爲東歐集團拒絕馬歇爾計劃以來歐洲企圖彌補東西裂痕之初次嘗試。</p>
<p>被邀請各國除蘇聯外，計有白俄羅斯，烏克蘭，阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞，捷克，芬蘭，匈牙利，挪威，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，瑞典，瑞士，南斯拉夫及特里雅斯特自由邦等。此外，瑞典，挪威與瑞士三國均曾出席巴黎經濟會議，但尚未參加關稅同盟研究團體。其已參加者即爲歐洲經濟會議英，法，義，奧，丹，希，冰島，愛爾關，葡，土，比，荷及盧森堡等十三國。其中比利時，荷蘭與盧森堡三國業已訂立關稅同盟，對於此項組織頗具經騐，願以歐洲關稅伺盟研究國體之發起國自任。組織歐洲關稅同盟之議，前在巴黎初次提出時，英國未置可否。據稱，須先取得加拿大，澳洲，紐西蘭，南非，印度及巴基斯坦各邦同意，然後決定參加與否。</p>

<p>〔合衆社羅馬十二日電〕義大利左派諸領袖十二日提出其第二次對加斯具利政府之不信任動議，但再度警告義國內形勢不變更，將用力量推翻社會民主黨之政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕此間外交官員今日宣稱：莫斯科指揮下之義大利共產黨，已發動「義大利爭奪戰」，此種戰鬥待機已久，其所引起之危機，將使美國援助計劃緩不濟急。義大利農工百萬人工潮之蔓延，社會黨之要求對加斯貝利政府投不信任票，以及最近其他種種發展，似爲共產黨運動之一部份，以謀推翻政府，爲蘇聯奪取義大利。義大利極有發生內戰之可能性。義大利和約條件苛刻，義大利政局已深感不安，將來美軍撤退，對於該軍東北區定將發生極大影響。該區義大利人民受和約規定，不得不離鄉背井，撤入非武裝新界綫，而以其第一次世辦大戰後所獲得之領土割讓隣國。共產黨宣稱已集中力量於義大利北部沼河流域，使義大利人恐權南斯拉夫益甚。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕國務院對於外傳若于外國政府，現正向美國談判購買大宗軍火一項消息，態度頗爲鎭靜。據某發言人解釋，該院之軍火管理局對於美國一切輸出之武器或彈藥，有絕對管制權力。軍火商每次欲輸出任何戰爭武器至外國政府，則輸出武器項目應由該局加以淸查。關於軍火出口管制並無常規，每一次皆個別加以考慮。該局對軍火商所發出口證，祗一次運輸有效。在作此項決定前，須與陸海兩部會商，徵求該兩部對獲得武器之某一特別國家，是否有何反對。</p>

<h3>一羣女兒從軍去　下關站上被截留　第五軍滬杭招考發現疑點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕自稱第五軍新聞處秘書之彭伯倫，在滬杭招考女政工人員廿餘人，十三日晨七時一刻乘車由滬抵京時，在下關車站被警務處及憲兵隊扣留。執行檢查之憲兵稱，「凡部隊招考人員，應呈經國防部核准，而彭某不能提出此項證件。」憲兵隊當將彭某扣留，全部女生送大華旅館暫住。其中王燕卿，羅怡，吳芝，史　生，王雷娜等五人，係在上海投考者，蘇淥華，王佩雄，朱幼安，厲　貞，朱芬，瞿幼王，陳雅淸，朱丹萍，王亞雄，羅劍深，趙華，孟瑛，王瑞君，吳靜芷，林淑淸，周靜秋，莊影，兪華，杜須明，汪麗珍，祝金陵，李鈺等廿二人，係在杭州投考者。渠等均係年在廿歲左右之少女，大半在中學讀書，成失業之人，記者在車站晤見渠等時，領隊之彭伯倫，正由憲警人員查詢中。渠等亦分別各自集合，紛紛談論沿途爲人猜疑之情形。記者旋即分訪其中數人，詢其投考目的及經過，據稱，渠等投考時最大因素，乃爲好奇。同時咸感有赴前方工作之機會，極爲難得，且招考時說明工作前之訓練期間，不會超過兩個月，即使在一個月內，認爲生活及工作不適合時，亦可中途請假返里，如工作適宜，即可繼續工作。在彭伯倫所執之招生册上，寫明爲「第五軍新聞醫務人員」。渠等亦稱投考時分類甚多，如鄉村敎學，戲劇，音樂，醫務等等，渠等均各投所好。渠等對沿途人負之懷疑態度，一部份表示不滿，認爲渠等乃是正式組織，而偏逍到處留難及麻煩之查詢。一部份則報以感謝之意，因渠等自己亦不明白前途之計劃也。據自滬護送至京之憲警告記者稱，渠等登車時，其家屬均不願渠等離去，顯見其中尚有疑問云。</p>
<p>滬杭兩地　招考經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第五軍新聞處，上月間在滬杭兩地招考新聞醫務人員，曾規定年齡在十七歲以上三十歲以下之未婚女子爲合格，一時前往報告應考者達一百餘人。最後在杭錄取女生二十七人，及在滬錄取女生五人，均年約十八九歲之少女。惟在招考期內，因並未取得當地政府之連繫，故事後女生家屬方面頗多因不明眞相而加反對者，因此曾有多數女生陸續退出。</p>
<p>迨至前晚，上述之杭州女生二十七人，乘夜車抵滬後，隨即轉搭京滬第十二次夜車前往南京，當時由一身佩「山西保安」符號之軍官自稱彭伯倫者所率領。此事因路局警務處及憲兵隊方面事前並未知情，一路上頗爲注意。迨昨晨抵達南京後，經憲兵隊查詢，發現證件不足，即將負責者彭伯倫·顧玉祥·黃藻華等三人及女生等扣押。</p>
<h3>領隊人員　冒名活動</h3>
<p>後經軍憲當局向第五軍方面調查後，聞係確有此事，但因負責主辦者彭伯倫在滬杭招考，多委託他人代辦，致手續上多有不合之處，而被委託之人員，多對第五軍情形並不熟悉，事後復爲取得行動上之便利，在滬杭之領隊人復冒彭伯倫之名，對外活動，致經憲警查問之際，言語與事實多有不符之處，以致令人發生疑竇。</p>
<p>上文所謂在滬率領女生前往南京之軍官彭伯倫，據事後偵悉，實係一名顧王祥所冒稱者，蓋彭伯倫本人早於上日夜間搭車返京。聞此事發生後，經上海方面調查結果，知悉在滬招老時，第五軍曾有公函致靑年國上海支團部，託其協助進行。惟憲警方面以値此全國總動員戡亂之際，如各機關有類此招生事件，事前似有取得當地政府密切合作之必要，否則漫無組織，恐有流弊叢生之虞也。</p>

<h3>金潮案維持原判　楊安仁扣押執行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動全國之金潮案，主角中央銀行業務局前副局長楊安仁，金號業公會理事長詹蓮生，前由地院依據懲治貪汚條例判決，楊安仁處有期徒刑七年，詹蓮生處有期徒刑四年，楊詹奉判不服，具狀高院聲請覆判。經刑庭長蕭變棻，推事丁蘇鴻，韓述之組合議庭，裁定原判決核准。被告詹蓮生早經羈押地院看守所，楊安仁在上訴期間仍准交保，茲因該案業經高院判決，高院於前日下午通知地院執行，地院查院長派黃書記官長親　密函送地檢處，同日下午四時地檢處全主任書記官，率領法警至常熟路一三一弄十八號拘提楊安仁到案。略訊年籍案情後，即予羈押思南路看守所。高院判決書原文甚長，其維持原判理由，認爲楊魯兩人有利用職務，共同舞弊，直接圖利之罪，略謂：「查本年二月初旬，黃金價格飛漲，八日爲政府對於金業最後配售之日，該同豐餘金號竟於是日承購黃金五百四十條，所交付之票據二十九億五千三百三十五萬元中，有二十五億另三百三十五萬元票據，並未於當日交換，或換得轉賬聲請書，而由中央銀行出納科存庫抵數，均經供認不諱。核其情節，顯有勾串圖利之行爲，原審據以判罪，並無遺誤。「對楊詹之辯解，則駁稱：「該聲請人，多方狡飾，無非意在獲免罪刑，自無足採。」</p>

<h3>郵工待遇不致再減</h3>
<p>郵務總工會負責人談話</p>
<p>關於國營事業機關人員待遇規定按照公務人員待遇不得超過百分之三十辦法，即將實行。消息傳來，引起各國營事業機關人員極大反響，據在滬全國郵務總工會負責人談：該項辦法僅見報載，各國營事業性質制度及員工福利設施不同，硬性統一實行，恐多阻碍。以郵局員工言，旣無宿舍食堂等福利設施，而薪資又低，且自七月份起又打八折，生活均極困苦，若再减低待遇，旣非郵工生活所能忍受，更難維持今日郵政良好服務效率，現在郵政正賴全體郵工之努力走向革新途中，故信任何减低郵工努力熱忱阻碍郵政進步之辦法，不致在郵局實行。如果實行，必遭全國郵工强烈有效反對，因此造成之後果，當由當局負之云。</p>

<h3>商業團體國代立委名額　四首長電立院建議擴增　船聯會亦再提出三點理由力爭</h3>
<p>全國性工商業團體國大代表，雖經國務曾議通過，由三十一名增爲六十八名，其分配辦法，由立法院決定之，然較之農業團體之一三四名，工人團體之一二六名，仍覺過少，且立法委員原額十五名，並未增加，因此工商團體尚感未能滿足。茲聞本市市長吳國楨，市參議會議長潘公展，市黨部主任委員方治，市社會局長吳開先，亦爲名額問題，聯函立法院孫院長，有所建議，原函如下：</p>
<p>「哲生院長鈞鑒：迭於報端獲護講論，發揚正義，言人所難言，具有轉移國際視聽效用，仰見元老壯獻，宣勤罔懈，下風逖聽，敬佩曷已。國積等備員滬上，日與工商業人士相週旋，深悉商人心理，以行憲伊始，凡屬國民，均有平等參政之權利一，此番商業團體，分配名額過少，致使各一方表示不滿，綜合各方意見，約有四端：</p>
<p>衡情度理失之過少</p>
<p>（一）國父倡導革命，向以全國國民爲對象，故吾人之革命，以全民革命相號召，吾人之政治，亦以全民之幸福爲基礎，政府一切設施，向無階級之分野。國父遺敎所昭告吾人者如此，憲法之立法精神亦在此，無待贅述，由是商業團體應與國內其他一切團體，享受平等之選舉權利，殆無疑義。（二）我國農工商國體之中，商業團體組織最爲健全，歷史亦極悠久，會員之人數尤爲衆多，全國各種國體，能與抗衡者，甚屬罕見。依選舉之原理言，其份子健全，人數衆多者，所出代議士之名額，允宜較佔優勢，方爲正道，然立法院所通過之名額分配表中，商業團體國大代表，僅佔十三名，立法委員僅佔五名，衡情度理，失之過少。</p>
<p>漫無標準不勝遺憾</p>
<p>（三）即使退一步言，几參加職業選舉之人口，與憲法規定應出之名額，應作平均之分配，國楨等手頭雖無精確之統計，足資參證，然商業團體所得之名額，與其會員人數相比較，必在一般水平以下，確係事實。再舉一例言之，若干自由職業團體，其會員人數，不足國大代表候選人履行登記時法定簽署之總額，故此次職業團體選舉名額之分配，不特殊欠公允，抑且尚有瑕疵。（四）再查職業團體國大代表名額之分配，於首屆國民大會時，已有成規可尋。民國三十五年，國府修正公佈之「國民大會代表選舉法」附表三，商業團體共計代表一〇四名，約佔工農商會總額三分之一，今舍此根據而不顧，另作漫無標準之分贈，實屬不勝遺憾。</p>
<p>商人參政深具熱心</p>
<p>查商人熱心參政，此亦憲政過程中良好現象，比聞鈞院即將洽商補救，具微廓然大公，從善如流，凡爲國人，同深佩戴。竊謂國大代表職業團體總名額，原爲四百五十名，擬請將總額增爲五百名，如此則商業團體連同原有之名額十三人，共爲六十三人，除三十五省十二院轄市各得一名之外，餘額十六名，以兩名分配於全國銀行公會聯合會，全國輪船業公會聯合會，所餘十四名，可就各省市之商業團體經濟地位，及會員數量，酌量增加名額，以期適應實際。</p>
<p>酌增限額稍慰羣情</p>
<p>立法委員職業團體總名額原爲八十四名，擬請將總額增爲九十名，如此則商業團體連同原有之名額五人，共爲十一人，除全國銀行公會聯合會，全國輸船業公會聯合會，各選一名外，其餘九名，因單位過多，事實上無從分區，祗有由全國商業團體合選。按照上述辦法，增額有限，當不致紛更過甚，牽動全案，但亦足以稍慰羣情，使選舉不致因部份停頓而全局爲之阻滯。明知此事中權自有權衡，國楨等循分省職，未容越俎，但鑒於輿論期望之殷，用敢於洽商改定之際，盡其抒德達情之責，肅函奉達，倘荷鑒核，俯賜採納，至深感幸，專肅敬公佈政祺。吳國楨·潘公展方治。吳開光謹啓」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕船聯會為要求國大代表及立法委員三名事，迭經分電有關各部院力爭。頃悉該會復以輪船業非普通商業團體可比，特再提出三點理由，電請立法院，社會部，組織部等主管機關，要求：（一）商業團體國大及立委名額，按照國民會議及上屆國民代表大會之比便增加，（二）在商業團體之名額中分配輪船業之名額，準由輪船業單獨選舉。</p>

<h3>華盛綢綾廠主　陳錦良被綁案　四和尚涉嫌昨受審訊　矢口否認與匪徒勾結</h3>

<h3>食油市場情形混亂　中信昨暫集配售　另訂新辦法週一或可恢復</h3>
<p>中信局昨日起，暫停配售食油。據該局購料處經理兪汝鑫談，此次倖配原因，係由於日內食油市塲過於混亂，辦法規章，均有檢討必要，特暫停配售，另訂週密辦法，一俟吳市長張總裁返滬後，即可決定。如時間可能，下週一即可恢復。目前問題之發生，全爲套購關係，（一）產地原料價漲，汕價亦隨之上升，跑單帮者乘機活躍，本地購進七十萬，運往鄉下，則售九十萬，市塲競購，抬高價格。（二）游資一部作崇，乘機從事囤積，希圖牟利。（三）除上述兩種情形之外，尚有冒險走私者，以致市塲激起劇烈波動，黑市與配價相去過遠。以本市供需之實際情况而論，本市需要量每月不過三萬餘担，本局配售而外，中植廠每日亦配六七百担，已佔去二分之一。本局此次準備三萬担，內五千四百担提作配售職工，尚餘二萬四千六百祖，已足應付市塲需要。其他汕廠亦有存汕，議本不成問題。今日情勢，實係人爲造成，現已禁止棧單交易。限成交後兩天提貨，即第一日成交，第二日付款，第三日提貨，逾期即買賣失效。今後辦法如何，尚難斷定，是否提高配價，亦待吳市長決定。至此次停配，決不致再影響市價，因該局每日配售數量，曾多至三市担，至少一千餘祖。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕自第三區植物汕製煉業公會於十三日在市塲暫停食油拋售後，油價波動激烈，唯中植油廠對其經常配售工作仍繼續維持，並不因此停止。茲悉該廠並決定下週一配售予丙組五〇一號至六〇〇號，零售油店計熟菜油每戶一桶，總計三百五十市担，每担價格七十五萬元云。</p>
<h3>四聯總處核定　從諫如流同棉花定貨貸欵</h3>
<p>四聯總處民生日用必需品定貨貸款，業經決定，不另訂辦法，而係逐案核定方式辦理，先就食油棉花兩項着手。本月十一日之理事會並經核定兩案。、</p>
<p>（一）中信局向第三區植物汕製煉工業同業公會訂購食汕數量爲三萬担，由中植大昌新等十廠，分別訂約。中植佔二分之一。價格方面，因市塲時有波動，不能預爲固定，特按付款日之行市洽定。每批買賣成交合約成立後，分三期付款。每十日付款一次，分三期在上海交貨，每十五日提交一次。由各曾員廠個別訂約，並分別另覓妥保。但各會員廠商仍須負聯環保證責任，油質檢騐，由中植負責。</p>
<p>（二）淮南各鹽墾公司總管理處核放棉貸五十億元，貸款期限定爲五個月，月息四分。貸款到期，以皮棉價還全部本息。皮棉價格，照付款時之行市洽定，以南通爲交花地點。</p>
<h3>統債下游　外股回跌</h3>
<p>公債昨再不支下游，成交更少，僅四百萬左右。二三〇室雖納，五五〇室五五二室及散戶略納，統丙晨開一二四〇〇元，即微降至一二〇〇〇元以下收市。結果較前收計甲乙戊各跌四〇〇元。丙種微陴三〇〇元，統丁則跌落七〇〇元。</p>
<p>外股昨盤旋而回跌，中途不定，證劵帮尚買，銀行有售，洋行廣帮進後即出。怡紗晨開一〇六〇〇元，先低至一〇四〇〇元，回漲到一〇七三〇〇元，復跌落至一〇三〇〇元，而後稍定。結果較前收計業廣電話尚平，紙業跌一成弱，怡啤鋼業祥泰各跌半成，怡紗英聯會德豐航業微挫。</p>

<p>日前汪裕泰，華茶等公司積極騐看之本年度祁門紅茶，昨市各向貨方探詢，惟買戶出價異常慳吝，每担僅一百廿萬元至二百萬元左右，致與賣者喊價形成倒懸，交易卒乏做開。其他花色，供求仍稀，市勢平靜，至於內銷茶，本街及客帮走銷迄未停滯，面各檔行情，雖在一般散戶絡繹吐售中，但因頻思高扳者亦不乏人，是以得能支持不墜，結果續呈盤旋之勢。</p>
<p>據業中人云：出口商渴望已久之本年度安化紅茶，以給價緊縮，難獲成交。又悉：刻下同業間特將五十箱裝往無錫，以供內銷，聞大都係中檔貨，價每担六十五萬元云。</p>
<h3>本市食米麵粉　借貸應可無問題　政府暫不拋售加強配米</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元，昨與記者談：本市食米及麵粉之供應可無問題。白粳薄稻雖有波動，但中級秈米始終維持卅餘萬元之價，故最近食米之漲風，與市民並無多大影響。政府對糧食有旣定政策，近期內不擬在市塲拋售，而努力於加强配售。蓋拋售雖可使市價抑平，但將刺激產區而使無貨來滬。食油因發現市場拋售，其間有弊，故中信局已予暫停。現正商洽，將拋售之技術方面予以改變。</p>
<p>國外洋米　尚有配額</p>
<p>又訊：本市食米存底極盟，即中信局訂購之洋米，本年已運到三十餘萬噸。據該局負責人談，本年國際糧食緊急會議尚有配額二十萬噸，本年年底以前分向美國·緬甸·暹邏等國購進，最近陸續起運，海辰輪所裝之緬米六千噸，日內即可到達。該局運到之米，均交由民食調節委員會，配給公敎人員及工廠職工，七月份起已撥交卅萬担。</p>
<p>店胃冷懈　粳米回挫</p>
<p>昨日米糧來源仍湧，南產兩市共到一萬三千六百餘石，店胃冷懈，交易淸淡，粳米回挫一二萬元，新粳狂落二萬餘元，早薄稻中次亦跌一二萬元，秈米新貨各路均到，新杜秈羊秈及糰秈亦挫二萬元，新陳客秈跟跌三五千至萬一元。白元陰元亦疲萬元，崑山新白元初次見新，天氣晴明，米市形勢已轉下游。</p>
<p>麵粉配價不動，繼續配售，市塲動態亦頗平靜，價無呼吸。麩皮鄉銷平常，仍居平定，惟小包因閩方去化嶼聯，市形活潑，豆餅互有參差，進出被微，價格堅疲不一。黃豆客銷不動，零化油廠亦呆，脩削二三千元，勢入盤旋之局。菉豆市化俏俐，續漲三五千元。蠶豆零化甚微，挺漲萬餘元。莞豆汕頭續辦，盤漲三五千元。生仁交淡，價無出入。芝蔴洋莊仍細，銷路平平，依然少神。紅糧北洋見懈，圓低三五千元，苞米北洋亦然見淡，高貨回挫三五千元，中次狂落七八千元。小麥供不應求，來貨極少，內地續挺，步漲七八千元。</p>
<p>豆油趨勢尚平，淸油亦少波動，蔴汕亦無變化，生油則去化活，本街交易爽快，挺升三四萬元，菜油猛漲七八萬元。</p>
<h3>日用品高漲</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市面，同業進胃仍强，又加業外參入鎚提，行情哄抬更烈。最後固本皂比上日再漲一萬九千，黃祥茂升一萬二千，箭刀升一萬五千，光華亨利牛脾等均升一萬餘元。</p>
<p>洋燭因原料迭漲，成本增加，鷄牌燭每箱步升萬元，其他各牌亦見軋升。</p>
<p>火柴美麗牌銷路獨好，價步升五萬，鳳凰升二萬，其餘新牌亦微挺。</p>
<p>火油配貨仍無消息，存薄銷暢下，高度桶裝漲至一百五十五萬至六十萬元均有成交，美孚聽油十九萬二三千元。</p>
<h3>人造絲突飛猛進　最高價超過三千萬元關</h3>
<p>人造絲第三九期配貨雖照常配給，而昨市行情又告突飛猛進。一二〇號金三馬有光，開盤二千八百十萬元成交後，即呈上揚。漲勢激厲，最大竟出三千萬元關外。中午收盤做三千萬元，下午因不乏乘高吐售，稍形平疲，最後價爲二千九百八十萬元賣出價。一二〇號斯尼亞，價做二千九百萬元，結果均比上日高漲二百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市人心堅節，各級喊價，均較上日價大起一百萬至一百五十萬元，D字等級喊三千四百萬元，但因貨缺，一致堅持，故成交極稀。中級另担成交價二百萬至二百五十萬元，高另担三百五十萬元至四百萬元均有交易。干經尤俏，二八分五担有單子貨，二千三百八十萬元做開價，開口貨另担，亦在二千一百五十萬元之間。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>受原料狂漲影響，更因罷工生產日少，以致各方搜羅甚殷，廠盤亦均提高。眞絲被面，昨市開盤一千三百萬元成交一張後，繼告上漲，收市即期做三百十六七萬元，週一期做三十萬元。格子璧縐喊四萬五千元有人要，未有成交。華錦縐高檔貨二萬七千五百元，林記蠟羽紗二萬八千五百元。民生花綈二萬九千元，均有成交，盛杭等貨，亦莫不高揚。</p>
<h3>下週人絲配價核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局昨開人造絲審價會議，決定本週人造絲掛牌價，東洋大富貴二三四〇萬元，其他金三馬天橋等二三三〇萬元，均較上週漲起二四〇萬元。</p>
<h3>呢絨價堅挺</h3>
<p>呢羢躉批行情，昨仍明堅暗挺。茶會上及大批發戶，均有相當開出，秋冬需銷之深灰呢羢嗶嘰，本客各帮進胃均健。一般英美猶太洋行家，大多數齊皆改沽美金，麥而等悉喊七元半一碼，平厚呢十二元半至十五元，大衣呢八元半至十二元半，如以法幣揭價出貨，大半尚多不照市價而以黑市爲標準。</p>
<h3>若干地區內匯　明日又將調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行兩局一庫內匯率，自十五日起，又有若干區將告調整，茲探誌如次：　厦門每千元收七五元，福州六五元，福建區其他各地八〇元。廣州七〇元，汕頭八〇元。南通徐州一二元。蕪湖蚌埠一五元。漢口武昌五五元。貴州二〇元。陝西一〇元。</p>
<h3>留學生請結外匯　須詳審合格證件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲留學生旅費及生活費外匯之結售事，頃由業務局發出第一一三號通函，致各指定銀行有所說明，囑查照辦理。原函略稱：「按照行政院之決定，關於目前出國留學，持有敎育部發給之證明書之學生，其旅費及生活費之外匯申請書，經由中央銀行非進口貨外匯申請審核委員會核准後，可予照外匯官價結售，惟僅限於「曾經敎育部第二次攷試及格，及准許自費出國留學之學生」，用特通函轉知查照，於結售外匯前，詳爲審核上項證件，以資慎重，幷請轉知貴行各分行查照爲荷。</p>
<h3>各方買氣旺盛　紗布俱見上升</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因客帮進取轉暢，本街業外人頗多搜求，兼以天氣秋凉，銷路活躍，各方需朮殷切下，市勢回昻。結果四十二支藍鳳紗盤高至一千九百五十萬元，，比上日回漲八十萬。廿支特雙馬軋升九十萬，輕雙馬及十六支光明，均升七十萬。其他各支粗細紗均升五六十萬至一百萬元不一。</p>
<p>棉布市况，初開即告上升，以實銷布疋價漲尤勁。並聞華北有巨額游資活動，各種利買消息籠罩下，更形踴躍，行情飛騰不已。詎至午收時，突傳橫綫支票不能當日抵用，又有中美借款成功之議，市氣頓告疲軟。迨至結果，龍頭細布比上日仍軋升一萬餘，爲五十三萬七千元。收後價又喊高至四萬八千有進，最後四萬三四千有成交，其他各布亦均軋升三四千至一二萬元不等。</p>
<h3>臨收賣氣瀰漫　華股初升後跌</h3>
<p>華股昨高價又難持久，中途之普遍性買風，使小型股中若新華新亞塵安等喊高至漲停板，全塲生氣盎然，十分俏利。證券帮大戶楊某，在塲外乘機出籠，加之外股回小，存多念了出簿，賣風立起，慘瀉甚速。不利消息若當日票據不能抵用，及中美貸款成功之訊紛傳，臨收熱股咸以低價結束，冷股以成交不普遍，亦有尚站高檔，前途又趨不定。</p>
<p>結果較前收即交股計中法漲一成弱，新華漲停後有回，軋升半成，永紗平平，信和美亞勤興微挫，永公新光景福華豐小升，景綸火柴榮豐閘北均平，餘者升降俱微，遞交股計華豐新光微升，永紗信和美亞景福勤興微降，塲外各老股升降俱微。</p>
<p>證交</p>
<p>昨通告，自九月十八日起，成交單位略有改動，計永紗改爲十萬股，新光美亞景福華豐中法榮豐勤興均爲五萬股。</p>

<h3>復興二週年紀念增刋　兩年來之上海電信</h3>
<p>— 郁秉堅</p>
<p>戰前交通部在上海的電化組織，有上海電報局，上海電話局，和國際電合等。自八一三全面抗戰以後，上海各電信機構悉被日敵攫佔。秉堅率領少數電信人員留滬擔任秘密通訊工作，及卅四年八月，日寇無條件投降，即奉令在滬組織交通部江南區電信規復處旋又改組爲京滬區電信接收委員會，以謀重建上海的電信事業，同年九月十四日，正式接收敵僞華中電氣通信公司。從那天起，全國第一大都市的上海與國內各地電氣通信的責任，已由我們負起來了。所以這一夭，是上海電信的復興紀念日，流光如駛，到了今天，已是兩足年了。</p>
<p>我們爲檢討過去策劃未來起見，謹將這兩年來本局的工作進展情形，略述於后：</p>
<p>復員時期</p>
<p>本局自接收敵偽華中電氣通信公司以後，旣要維持原有通信，復須規劃新闢電路，同時因勝利初臨，後方各公私機關工廠學校，均向京滬區復員，因此在一極短時間內，全國各地，都很迫切地要求和上海直接通訊。但該時本局人手旣極端缺乏，而上海自淪入敵手後，原有設備，俱遭破壞，接收到的又屬殘破不全的東西，以如此之局面，應付當時的需要，自屬捉襟見肘，顧此失彼。唯一辦法，祗有積極進行復員工作，即一面整修機綫，添置設備，和整頓業務，一面儘速使戰前上海報話兩局的熟練技報話業人員復員，並徵調後方各局資歷較深的員佐，來滬共同負擔這個艱鉅的工作，此外爲適應當時環境的需要，將華中的原有人員，加以甄別，擇優錄用，以補人手之不足。如此經過幾個月的策劃，到了去年五月間，本局每一部門，都有了專人負責，復員工作，至此告一段落。關於復員問題，還有一點，亦應該提出的，就是本局雖然有很多舊有員佐復員，和甄用不少華中職員，但因業務發展迅速，人手仍感不數，故於去年二月間又恢復了上海電信人員訓練所，招訓技報員佐，在短短的年餘中，卒業學員已達四百餘人，</p>
<p>初步建設</p>
<p>本局從去年復員工作告一段落後，上海市面，日趨繁榮，對外電信交通之需要更爲殷切，故本局業務，亦隨之作直綫式的上升，到了今年四月最繁忙的時候，每日來去報份數，竟達三萬餘份，長途電話來去話次數，亦超過一萬餘次，其繁忙程度，非特戰前從未有過，即戰時號稱特繁的重慶，亦未有過此種記錄。在此情形下，本局不得不加倍努力，展開了具有建設性的全面擴充工作，因此從去年下半年起，本局每一部份，不論其爲總辦公處·報房·長途台。營業處·發訊台·收訊台·交換所，以至材料儲運室等，無一不在緊張的空氣中工作。</p>
<p>經過一年餘的努力，到了今天，在設備方面已有各式無綫電發訊機三十五架，收訊機約五十架，自動電報快機十八套，長途、電話載波機終端機等二十餘架，市內電話自動及人工機六千餘號，市內及遙控綫，計有架空明綫約一千對公里，電　芯綫約三萬對公里，除市內電話因限於材料的來源因難，未能大量擴充外，各種設備，較之接收時，約增加三至五倍，效率方面亦屢加改進。</p>
<p>新的設備</p>
<p>此外復添置了多種新設備，如傳眞機，電傳打字機，分集式收訊機，超短波無綫電機，移頻通報設備，國際通話用的單邊帶無綫電終端機等，均爲戰前所未見，即在國外亦屬新穎的通信工具。</p>
<p>現在上海和各地的通信電路，計電報方面，有人工及快機電路四十八路，長途電話方面，有直達電路六十五路，其他可以轉接通話地點約共一百四十餘處，此外並於本年七月一日恢復了中美長途無綫電話。</p>
<p>新的業務</p>
<p>在業務方面，這兩年來所做的工作，比之工務部份，更爲繁重。尤其在最近的半年中，本局依照交通部和電信總局的指示，完成了很多改進業務的新措施，這對於本局未來的發展，有着很大的關係。已舉辦的事項，約有下列幾端：</p>
<p>（一）關於便利民衆方面者有：增設分營業處及代辦所（現有十六處）普設公用電話（現有一百三十餘處），創辦電亭及行動電局（現有電亭六處行動電局二輛）。</p>
<p>（二）關於改進服務方面者有：設立示範營業處（現有三處），設置營業處及市內電話，服務台，添置長途查詢台及申告台，來報代譯，編印營業員服務手册，改善處理手續，加强服務精神等。</p>
<p>（三）關於新業務之辦舉者有：開放京滬眞蹟電報，開放减價交際電報，電話收發電報，電話通知收取去報，代傳長途電話，開放减價夜信電報，開放减價夜間電話等。</p>
<p>（四）關於增進速率方面者有：電報限時送達，特快電話限時接通，增加有無綫電快機電路（現有十五路），增加載波電話電路（現有四十一路），採用電傳打字機（現有十一架），報差用機車送報（現有六輛），增加特快電話電路（現有七路），增加特快電報電路（現有十八路）等。</p>
<p>（五）關於準確之改進者有：抽查報底紙條，挨戶查詢，實行工作競賽，嚴厲執行錯誤處罰等。</p>
<p>（六）關於宣傳方面者有：加強業務稽查詢問，寄發試騐函，增貼速率籤條，加强廣告及記載，橱窗陳列，電影，幻燈，以及廣播等。</p>
<p>其他工作</p>
<p>除工業務之外，其他方面，像代總局及各局接收儲運和購辦材料，代交部核發進口護照，及轉口憑證，整理本市廣播電台，取締私設電台，管理特設電台，舉行船舶無綫電報務員考試整理本局戰前自有及接收敵僞的房地產，甄審留用復用人員，淸理敵僞債務及材料帳册等，都是本局特別繁重的工作。</p>
<p>工作檢討</p>
<p>在這兩年來，我們雖然不斷的增加設備和改進業務，並且承蒙各界對本局的努力，給予許多鼓勵和有價値的批評，使得我們更加興奮更加警惕，但以業務發展過速，致設備與人手的補充，不能追隨並　，因此業務上的各項革新，，還未能吻合旣定的計劃，迅速完成。例如現在各方要求我們坩闢直達電路，或加長通報通話的時間，而我們因爲機綫缺乏，人手不數，一時不能辦到。再像我們很想擴充市內電話用的自動機鍵，以應各界的需要，但因一時甚難購到，無法實行。以上種種，考其原因，不外乎經濟和物質兩受限制，致不能盡所欲爲。蓋在目前的環境下，添置或改革一很小的設備，動輒需款達數千萬或數億元，而電款支絀，爲一般人所週知的事實，自難一一負担，兼以物炎之缺乏，爲戰後世界一般的普遍現象，我國如此，其他各國，亦莫不如此，例如電纜及自動電話機鍵兩項，在最近兩年內，歐美各國均難供給，這都是意外的困難。再一切建設，時間爲最重要的因素，不能一蹴即成。現在我們所做到的祗是初步的建設，初步的改進，留在我們後面的，還有很多應該做的事，我們自然應該負起責任，來完成這許多未竟的工作。</p>
<p>擴充計劃</p>
<p>我們現在雖然逢到不利的時期，和逆勢的環境，但我們不能推却責任，亦不能不設法克服困難，並且鑒於兩年來本局業務的發展情形，和今後上海更趨繁榮的可能性，除了改進業務，充實設備，改善機械效率，加强員佐服務精神諸端，仍當本旣定方針，繼續邁進外，我們認爲要配合將來的需要，還應該有一個遠大的建設計劃，雖因一時財力物力不足，不妨分期去做，或就可做者先做，如此積年累月，亦有成功的希望。根據這樣的原則，今年二月間，我們擬了一個充實內部設備的計劃，在此計劃中，主要的有，擬增添强力無綫電發訊機五架，新建收發訊合各一處，增加自動電話四千號，添置電信打字機二十架，打字複鑒機十架，增加畏途台設備一倍以上，以及籌建電信修配所一處。並預計在此計割實行後，可增闢電報電路三十路，長途電話電路八十路，市內電話多添四千號，以之應付目前及兩年中之需要，已屬綽乎有餘。至於所需經費，在本年二月間計算，約需二百億元，固非目前電款支細情形下所能全部負担，但我們已就可能做者，呈准總局開始進一行。預計年內可完成收訊台一處一，擴充中央室機件至所需程度，一長途台的設備亦可完成一部份，若明年上半年能購到主要機件，如發訊台及自動電話機鍵等，並繼續充實其他設備，則此計劃明年底或有完全實現的可能。屆時目前所有的缺點和困難，都可打破，上海的電信，將進入另一新階段，這是我們所深切期待的。</p>
<p>最後希望</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲電信是公用事業之一，他的發展，是有賴於社會的共榮共勵和協助推進，因此我們懇切地希望各界能繼續隨時供給我們實貴的建議和批評，並且告訴我們應興應革的路徑，使我們有指示迷津的南針，這樣電信的發展，必更迅速有效，我們的最終目標，即電信的三大條件，迅速準確和便利亦能及早達到。</p>

<p>電信爲技術的事業，非有專門人材爲之經營管理，難期發展。而此項專門人材，非有專門學校爲之造就，則無所取給，此交通部電信總局設立電信人員上海訓練所之由來也。電信人員上海訓練所係由電報學堂，電報傳習所，電信學校遞嬗而來，創辦於前淸光緒八年，迄今歷時已六十五載，與我國創辦電信歷史，同其悠久。最初校址在胡家宅之會香里，（原址今福州路西藏路大中華飯店）聘香山唐璧田先生爲敎員，學額二十名。第一班畢業生即曾淸鑑先生等二十人，學堂總辦爲毘陵姚彥鴻氏，當時畢業無定期，擢其優者，派各電報局値報，缺額則陸續考補。不工年遷至鄭家木橋電報總局中（今中正東路福建南路西轉角處）學額漸增，於是添聘敎習牛尚周·張兆　諸氏。嗣設測量熟，聘丹麥人博怡生敎授電氣測定，修整電機，架設電綫等科目。光緒十一年舉辦一全國報務員升班彙考，嗣後每逢子午卯酉年舉行一次，成績及格者升班升等，成績優異者，留所補習測量，以期深造。當時凡敎授拍發電報手法者，名按報熟，　因電局增多，需材孔亟，遂添設額外按報熟。新生入學，先在額外按報熟受初步訓練，再入正式按報熟。曾淸鑑·唐文高·兪書祥·榮永淸諾氏相繼任敎習。光緒廿四年，博怡生因病回國，繼之者丹麥人葛雷生，葛氏物故，唐璧田先生繼任。自茲而後，設局益多，用人愈廣。光緒二十五年，另賃西門內安康里民屋（今老西門肇嘉路中華路轉角處）增設按報熟，與預科測量熟。光緒廿六年庚子第六屆升班彙考，國府先主席林公，以台灣報務員出身之資格，來滬參加考試？並留所學習測量。光緒廿七年，復於總局之旁，增設按報熟一所。光緒廿八年，設電報高等學堂於新閘路五十九號（今一四四六號），聘丹麥人德連陞爲總敎習，曾淸鑑先生等爲助敎，定額十二名，兩年畢業，敎授電信高級技術。至光緒三十二年，全國電信改歸官辦，鄭家木橋之電報學堂，隨總局而遷至老垃圾橋北堍，分設測量熟，按報熟，額外按報塾，附讀學堂，旗生學堂，訓練電信中初級幹部。以上所謂熟與學堂者，皆隸屬於電報總局，及後更名之電政總局，由總局中之學堂總辦管理之。學堂總辦兪書祥·郭壽岡·王廷樞諸氏，先後任理。至宣統二年，併各學熟而爲一，名曰電報學堂，移至愛文義路（在成都路西）分列科目，依學費增入各科，學額四十，六十，八十名不等，由電政總局考核科長兼轄學堂，曾淸鑑呂成章諸氏，相繼任之。至民國元年，改爲電報學校，校長張錫藩先生，未半年，改爲電報傳習所，仍由張氏充所長。二年秋，遷至南市王家碼頭直街。所中分初等班，中等班，高等班，日文班，簿記班，無綫電班，快機班，工程班等，其課程學額，皆由交通部隨時規定招考。新生應試注重國，英，數，理，地理等科目，肄業時，學膳宿費均免，訓練一年或二年。入中等班者，須在局工作滿三年，有功無過，於開班時由局報名，經初試複試及格，始得肄業。高等班須中等班畢業，任事滿三年，歷屆上考，俟開班時老選入學。初等班畢業者派各電局值機，中等班畢業者任簡局業務長，高等班畢業者，任各繁局科長，或業務長。民國十四年添設函授中等班，使各局初級報務員，於公餘之暇，得受電信技術上之再訓練。十六年國府奠都南京，在上海設立全國電政總局，各局練習報務員，以次調滬甄別，成績稍次者留所補習，即所謂補習班也。十七年開招中等班四十名，由總局派王毓祥氏充敎務長，是年底，令將傳習所改爲電信學校，委王氏爲校長，敎務長由于潤生氏充任，十八年七月，郁秉堅先生繼任敎務長，是年畢業有綫電中等班四十人，補習班五十人。十九年，畢業無綫電中等班二十人，有綫電中等班二十人。迨二十一年一月二十八日，日寇侵滬，南市亦受影響，紛紛遷避，在校肄業之無綫電中等班十三人，簿記中等班二十八人，即於是時畢業。初等班四十二人，則遷至四馬路電報局繼續上課，完成學業。電信學校，於是年四月，暫告結束。嗣後續招新生，均在上海電報局訓練。二十六年抗戰軍興，電信人員隨軍撤退。三十四年秋，勝利復員，電信總局於是年底，下令在上海續辦電信人員訓練所，以十八年前之敎務長，現在上海電信局郁局長秉堅兼任所長。肇劃經營，就閘北育嬰堂路，前敵偽華中電信學院爲所址，招訓高中華業，年在二十二歲以下之男生一百二十人，分技術·級務·話務三班·華工程師士鑑兼任敎育主任，孫一副局長洪鈞，邱工程師镕材，兼任技術員班主任，李處長桐，兼報務良班主任，朱工程師福儀兼話務員班主任，聘學騐俱優之救授多人，擔任各項課程。三十五年秋，話務員班三十人畢業，呈准續招二十歲以下高中肄業生一百名，爲快機實習報務員。本年三月，技術員班十五人，三等報務員班四十九人，實習報務員班九十八人，同時畢業，派赴各電局工作。同月又招訓維護打字電報機三等技術員三十人，由李工程師國樑充任班主任。此種打字電報機，新近購自美國，爲電氣通信最新式之機器。本年五月，續招三等報務員班四十人，實習務員班一百人，均在肄業中，現正計劃開辦中等班，遴選各局三等技報人員，來滬深造，蓋戰後之電信事業，已非昔比，半精不熟之通才，實難能達到應付裕如之目的也。溯自本所創辦迄今，雖名稱屢更，但一脈相承，爲我國主要之訓練電信專才機關，則亘六十五年無異也，統計畢業同學，前後不下四千人。抗戰期間，諸凡通信修造管理各級幹部，大半出自本所門墻，所負使命如是之大，所歷時間，如是之久，所產人才，又如是之衆。上自國府林主席，郵傳部侍郞朱寳奎·交通總長高恩洪·梁教彥。電政司長局萬鵬·周家義。榮　濟·徐中哲·吳佩璜·陶鳳山諸氏，以及蔣範五公使等，下迄全國各局諸幹部，其貢獻於國家　會者如斯，宜其可以發揚踔厲，日就月將，成一充實光輝之巨校　。考諸事實，則尚未盡合理想，校舍不數應用，課餘無運動塲所，儀器圖書亦感式微。當此復興建國，首宜造就大量中級電信幹部人才，並養成其有純正之操行，嫻熟之技能，強壯之體魄‘庶可配合現代之需要也。</p>
<h3>速寫行動電局</h3>
<p>— 兪昂魯</p>
<p>麻雀雖小　五臟俱全　要打電報　此處請便</p>
<p>行動電局經過了長時期的準備，試騐和改善，終於在八月十二日的淸晨，首次和市民們在街頭相見了。行動電局是一輛裝有無綫電收發報機的藍白色大客車，車身右面有三個收受電報的半圖形窗口，車頭前端附有活動的書寫　板，它是一座活動的，電報營業處，也是電信局裏一位忠實的「跑街先生」，每日上午它從福州路電信局總營業處出發，不辭辛勞地在街頭馳　，無論風霜雨雪嚴寒潯署，都得要出動。淸晨先要把電局裏和車裏的收發報機，雙方試騐一下，等到收聽滿意後，才把它放走開動。這樣，局裏的營業員和車上的營業員有了聯絡，在「哈　」聲中，報緩地向市街進發。</p>
<p>開車的時候，有一點困難：因爲車頂上斜立着一根「釣魚桿」式的天綫，如果接觸到馬路上面那些縱橫不一的電纜，而天綫上却有着大量的電流通過着，一碰之下，可不是玩兒的。所以在開行時，只好用繩把那根「釣魚桿」拉平，到站停下後，再把它豎起來。當第一天車子停在大世界門前時，許多人以爲這是警察局的巡邏車到了，也有人說這是捉攤販的車子，嚇得攤販們一哄而散。後來看見車上寫着「行動電局」「電報電話」等字樣，這才恍然大悟。但也有馬上圍攏來看個究竟的，也有伸手要買郵票的，經車上的營業員非常和氣地加以答覆和解釋後，到第二天已經有許多人前來「問津」了。</p>
<p>在這裏，時間和空間彷彿縮小了，整整的一天中，行動電局先後穿過了繁華市區，每到一個規定站，便有半小時以上停留，好讓市民們從容地拍電報。車上收到電報後，立即用無綫電傳送到福州路總營業處去，所以在行動電局打電報，和親自送到福州路去，電無分別，並且還可以節省一筆車資和人力。這種行動電局，將來還預備擴充到郊區去，使得大上海每個角落，都可以隨時隨地打電報。</p>
<p>在這輛車子裏，還有兩個新花樣，要向大家介紹的，第一個是它裝有一具最新式「鋼絲錄音機」，可預先灌入各種宣傳節目，送到車上播送，第二個是預備把江海關的洪亮鐘聲，從行動電局裏的擴大器轉播給全市民衆，使得全上海的時鐘指針，都整齊劃一的走動。</p>
<p>行動電局必將隨着欣欣向榮的電信事業與日俱進發揚光大起來。如果你有空，希望你去看看這個劃時代的科學產兒！電信局的跑街—行動電局</p>
<h3>電信常識講話（三）</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>特快電報是一種限時到達的電報，凡沿京滬綫各地往來的特快電報，限一小時半送達，其他開放特快電報各地往來，統限二小時到達。如果你收到一張從南京發來的特快電報，報頤裏所載的交發時刻假定為14．30（即下午二時三十分）而你接到這張電報的時間却已在下午四點鐘以後，那就證明這張電報已經超過特快電報的時限，你就可以向電局提出質問，要求把特快電報附收的特快專送費退還發報人。快信，快信當然應該此平信快，所以，加急電也要比尋常電來得快些。要是你收到一張加念電比較從同一地方發來的尋常電更慢，那你就有充分的理由向電局提出質問，要求調查稽延原因。電信總局參照最近各電局通報情形，規定爲加急電限四小時以內尋常電限八小時以內到達。上項時限，係自發報人把電報交到發報局營業處起，直到收報局投送給收報人爲止。</p>
<p>夜信電是一種收費低廉的電報，照尋常電减半收費，但每電起碼照二十五個字計費，夜信電排在最後拍發，當然要比尋常電慢些。</p>
<p>交際電是專爲慶弔等事拍發的電報，可利用電局編好的詞句，每電起碼照二十字照尋常電報半價計費，並且可以附送禮劵。收報局收到交際電報後，即分別性質，用緋色（慶賀用）或素色（弔唁用）的精美電封和電紙抄送，非常美觀。</p>
<p>報頭裏的第三項是發報局名，用以表明這張電報是從什麽地方發來的。發報局名通常都用英文拍發，待收報局收到後把英文譯成中文地名，注明在來報紙上。收報人對於發報局名如有疑問，可將中英文互相對照。</p>
<p>字數項裏所記的字數是指這張電報報頭以下從納費業務標識算起一直到末一字爲止共有多少字數。在洋文明語電文裏，有時發報人把原該分做兩個或幾個字的字連接寫成一字，電局雖能照拍但必須根據實含字數計算報費，此外，有些寫在電文裏的字母或數目組合，因爲已經超渦電局規定長度照章必須分作二個或幾個字計費，在這種塲合下，多在字數項裏註明兩種字數，中間有分數斜劃隔開。例如35/32意即表明這張電報雖祗有三十三個字，但電局係照三十五個字收費。當你收到一張電報，發覺電文裏的字句很難解釋的時候，你就不妨把報頭下面的字細細點計一下，看它是否和報頭裏字數項內所記的字數（如有分數斜劃隔開應以斜劃後面的字數爲準）是否相符。如果不符那就多半是給電局漏發了一個字或幾個字，可以向電局交涉查補。（未完）</p>
<h3>上海電信局　總營業處巡禮</h3>
<p>— 丁華</p>
<p>飛躍進步中的電信事業，改造了整個世界</p>
<p>福州路往東，外難相近，四川路轉角處，聳立着一幢四層大厦，上海電信局總營業處。這掌握着全國電信總樞紐的龐大機構，在大衆的腦海中該有相當印象吧！因爲電信是交通方面不可或缺的東西，尤其是東方第一大都會的上海，商業上，經濟上在在需要它來構通與各地間的聯繫。</p>
<p>白雲深處電旗揚——總營業處雄姿</p>
<h3>本局業務槪況</h3>
<p>— 李桐</p>
<p>丙·營業部份</p>
<p>一·電報：本局復局之初，電報營業部份僅福州路七十號總營業處一處，偶遇市塲變動，輒有人滿之息。爲便利顧客减少擁擠起見，光後於本市長治路廿五號，中山南路五九號及福建路，愚園路，思南路，金陵東路，各郵政支局內暨北火車站公用電話所，南市浦東吳淞閔行各電話交換所，橫浜橋本局內分別籌設分營業處十二處，並委託四川路及林森中路中國旅行社，金陵東路四川旅行社，貴州路一八二號新新公司代收電報。復於北火車站月台，文廟路公園內，南京路外灘，及龍華飛機塲等四處設置電亭，除收受電報外並裝有公用電話及長途電話以供顧客不時之需。目下正擬在衡山路，寳慶路口，南京西路泰興路口，西藏路，南京路口，及長寗路中山公園門口等處籌設電亭，以祈普遍供應。又爲便利裝有市內電話之顧客起見，除隨時可甩電話通知本局派員前往收取電報外，並可向本局營業科申請登記，利用電話傳遞電報，同時於行動郵局第一二三路汽車內附設電局收受電報，復開駛自行設計之行動電局汽車一輛，環行全市，該車裝有最新式超短波收發機，將收受之電報立即交機拍發，以資迅捷。</p>
<p>本局除增闢營業分處，儘量予顧客以便利外，復積極刷新內部，於總營業處內設立公衆服務台、代繕電報，解答詢問，兌換小鈔，同時裝設綫路通綫表及有無綫電直達電路表，以資醒目，並於各營業分處採用最新式電傳打字機傳達電報。近復添顧大批業條員施以短期訓練，除電信章則外，對於應對態度待人禮貌尤經愷切諭導，隨時考核，現均能切實奉行，予顧客以良好印象，</p>
<p>二·電話</p>
<p>電話業務可分下列三類：</p>
<p>A·市內電話：因目前電話機件缺乏，雖申請裝設市內電話者，紛至沓來，然本局仍無法予以普遍裝設，爲補救該項缺陷起見，故在本市各衝要地點及市區四郊，裝設公用電話，至目前止，已裝有公用電話〕百三十九處，分佈全市，至其他各處，尚在裝設中。所有裝置公用電話之地點，均懸有本局特製之公用電話標識，俾易辨認。至公用電話通話費除長途電話通話費另有規定外，市內通話費，每次爲國幣一千元，打不通者免費。如掛有本局公用電話標記之公用電話處，洧浮收話費等情事，希隨時函告本局，以便取締。</p>
<p>B·國內長途電話：勝利後長話之工作重心，亦着重於「通」「暢」「速」三點，未通者求其通，已通者求其暢，旣暢後求其速。二年來吾國國內長途電話網伸張之速度實堪驚人，至目前止能與上海通話之地點已有台北，重慶，漢口，廣州，天津，南京等一百八十七處。最近本局印有長途電話價目表一種，內容包括長途電話使用法通話地點，價目及綫路圖等，各界如欲需用請向福州路七十號或四川北路一七六一號本局營業科索取，不取費用。</p>
<p>C·國際無綫電話：抗戰前本局已開放國際無綫電話，抗戰時期暫時停頓，本年七月一日起中美無綫電話先行復話，其他如馬尼剌倫敦等地亦正在試話中，如試騐成績良好即可次第開放。</p>
<h3>上海電信史話</h3>
<p>— 孫洪鈞</p>
<p>上海古稱濱海斥鹵之地。先後屬揚，吳越楚諸州郡，宋時，始立爲鎭，旣而改設縣治，以迄明淸。道光二十三年，（公元一八四三）雅片戰役結束，闢爲中外通商口岸，遂有英法兩租界之設立；其時歐美科學昌明，交通事業日趨發述，而當時淸廷有識之士，亦鑒於交通事業與一國經濟文化有密切之關係，故由前淸北洋通商大臣直隸總督李鴻章等奏准設立津滬電報局，以奠吾國電信事業之基礎。民十六年，上海設市，此後商業繁盛，人烟稠密，而電信之爲用亦日廣。</p>

<h3>介紹業務稽查</h3>
<p>— 蔣雋人</p>
<p>電信是公用事業的一種，乾脆地說是一個比較範國大一些的商業機構。但商店是專門出售商品給顧客，而電信局並無商品出售，專門爲顧客通信便利上服務。一般商店的營業方針，是如何迎合顧客的心理，使他們的營業蒸蒸日上。我們電信局自不能例外，所以當局爲了要明瞭大衆的心理，使業務可隨了大衆的意見有所改進，　設立了業務稽查室，直接隸屬於業務處。業務稽查室的職責，一面是徵求和募集大衆對本局業務的意見，一面是稽查和考核局內工作人員的效率。戰前業務稽查室的工作對象比較簡單，因爲戰前本局業務不像今日發達，業務旣淸閒，業務稽查的工作也隨之簡單了：只要注意工作人員的效能，使每張電報在規定時間內到達，便可高枕無憂。現在可不然啦，來去電報，激增了十倍之多，而本局的機器不多，人手又這樣缺乏，工作人員又非得經過特殊的訓練不足以勝任的，外面招收來的新手，加以補訓練當須半年，本局自己訓練所每年畢業的人手，那裏經得起這探大量的需求，由於上述的兩種困難，來去電報難免有偶然的稽延，爲了這問題，我們也曾煞費苦心，用種種方法去應付和改善，但在未能獲得足够的新式機器和足够的人手之前，是很難有顯著進步的，不過我們並不灰心，相反地我們相信這種困難是人力所能克服的。我們從最近幾月的統計數字中，可以看出業務是日在進步中。</p>
<p>在這逐月增加的字數中，更値得一提的，是用戶因不滿而責雖事項，並不因之增加，這便是說明我們的努力已日見生效。我們更感激外界能不斷底給我們善意的建議和協助，使我們能逐漸改進我們的業務。</p>
<p>稽查室因爲要深切明瞭一般用戶對本局的意見，每月平均發出稽查信箋千餘件，請用戶直接將本八的意見寄紛本室，本室再薈集了上述的意見，分別通知本局關係部門加以改進，我們更須負責督促他們的改進，務使達到用戶的期望。例如業務稽查須經常到各營業處去考核營業員的工作，並視察各營業處一般狀况，我們見到了本局福州路總營業處的擁擠情形，曾硏究其癥結所在，發現一因市塲物價波動不定，使電報的繁忙程度亦無一定；二因發報人未能儘量利用他們就近的分營業處。我們希望讀者以後如欲拍發電報，請利用就近的分營業處，牠的效力與總營業處究全相同，並且可使發報人和營業員都减少擁擠之苦。</p>
<p>關於電話部份。稽查室須出勤稽查全市公用電話的收費情形，我們時常發現經理公用電話的行號有不照規定價月收費，這是很遺憾的，要知電信局設置公用電話的目的完全是便利公衆，因爲戰後器材缺乏，不能盡量應大衆的需要，裝設住宅及營業電話，所以普遍裝置公用電話，使每一市民，都能享受電話的便利，因此我們希望經理公用電話的行號，切勿將公用電話作爲自己歛財的工具，而應該多多服務，這是電信局和大衆的共同願望。</p>
<p>總括的說，業務稽查室的責任，是對外界求取聯繫，所以我們十分歡迎讀者。對本局業務需要改善的地方，儘量供給意見，使我們可以多得些參考，而知所應興應革之道。</p>
<p>稽查室地址：</p>
<p>福州路七〇號</p>
<p>電話一七八〇一</p>
<p>筆者趁一個巧合的機會，在電信局總營業處作了個簡單巡禮，這里把所見到的介紹在下面：</p>
<p>一進門，寬敞的地位，整齊的佈置，和那美化的點綴，首先使你發生一種好感。有綫和無綫電路阻通表分列在正中的廊柱上，那處電報通暢，那處阻斷，可以一目瞭然。四五只沙發椅安靜地靠在牆邊，等待發報人的小憇。靠左邊角隅，安放着一只公用電話的亭子，旁邊是公衆服務台，一位年靑的職員忙着替人家寫電報，承答發報人的詢問，桌上一架電話機，想是專備顧客隨時使用的！</p>
<p>這時，里面走出一位和善的一先生來，他告訴我許多寳貴的材一料，也指示我不少電報上的常識。</p>
<p>「這里是示範營業處」，他說：「所以設備方面比較完備，揭示的許多圖表，就是專供發報人參考的」。</p>
<p>「電報價目表」，「發報人須知」，「本市各營業處位置圖」，「有綫無綫通達路綫圖」，以及「交際電傳眞電格式」，等等，他一一給我說明。</p>
<p>「這許多是無法投遞的電報」，他指着玻璃框中貼滿了的通告，繼續說：「這些電報或因地址不詳或因收報人遷移的緣故，揭示待領」。</p>
<p>「請問打一個電報，要經過那幾步手續」？我把談鋒轉了過來。</p>
<p>下面是那位先生的談話：</p>
<p>「這里共有十七個窗口—尋常電在左手一號至四號，加急電在右邊十二號至十五號，特快電在中間七號至九號，其他軍官電在十號十一號，傳眞電交際電在十六十七號。要打電報，先找到適當的窗口，把塡寫好了的電報交給裏面的職員，經過計算字數和開發回執後，便可在隣近窗口付款，當收款員交給你蓋有收銀日戳的向執時，手續便完備了。遇到人多擁擠時，發報人必須依次排隊，可以把秩序弄好。最近本市各處分設營業處後，擁擠情形便减少了」。</p>
<p>「請問目下每天營業總數有多少」？我問。</p>
<p>「上海局平均每天發報五千份，營業總額在一億七千萬左右，其中總營業處約佔百分之八十。營業狀况大概與市面上落稍有關係，遇到物價波動，電信便見頻繁，最高峯曾在一萬份以上呢」！</p>

<h3>Party and Youth League Joint Conference of the Fourth Plenary Session Successfully Concludes Task, President's Admonition Encourages Building a New China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Kuomintang's Fourth Plenary Session held its third general meeting at 4 PM on the 13th, with President Chiang as chairman. After the secretariat reported the number of attendees, the presidium reported on the following: (1) A proposal by Zhang Ji and 41 other committee members regarding the handling of enemy and puppet properties, stating that except for institutions and schools allowed to negotiate purchases, all others must participate in bidding to purchase; (2) A suggestion by Committee Member Pang Jingtang regarding the central government's active relief efforts for pacification provinces such as Shandong, and seeking four points for revival and construction; (3) A proposal by Committee Members Song Ziwen, Zhang Ji, and Ding Weifen to establish the China Kuomintang Comrades Mutual Aid Association. The above three proposals were decided to be submitted to the Central Standing Committee. Subsequently, the general meeting passed the following three major cases: (1) The President's nomination of candidates for the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee (list recorded separately); (2) A telegram of appreciation to the soldiers suppressing the rebellion; (3) The draft declaration of the general meeting presented by the Drafting Committee of the Declaration. The general meeting's tasks were thus declared successfully completed. The President delivered an immediate admonition, which lasted an hour before concluding. The meeting adjourned at 5:35 PM. At 6 PM, the closing ceremony of the Kuomintang Fourth Plenary Session and the Central Party and Youth League Joint Conference was solemnly held.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] President Chiang delivered a speech lasting approximately one hour at the third session of the Fourth Plenary Session at 5 PM on the 13th. Everyone present was moved by his earnest and passionate address. After his speech, the entire venue responded with enthusiastic applause, which lasted for a long time. The gist of the President's address was as follows: The unified organization of the Party and the Youth League is a major action in the Party's revolutionary history. The harmonious atmosphere, sense of responsibility, understanding of the overall situation, and clear understanding of the great principles, disregarding personal status and rights, and sacrificing preconceptions at this meeting, truly moved me. Even the revolutionary martyrs would surely be comforted. This is truly a great achievement of our Party. However, after the unified organization of the Party and the Youth League, the Party's responsibility is great, and the responsibility of the Central Committee members is particularly significant. Therefore, I especially hope that everyone will concentrate their efforts, strengthen unity, to complete the following important tasks: (1) Complete the task of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, implement the general mobilization order, and all Party members should be models for the national people. (2) Party members should fulfill their minimum obligations to the Party, must pay Party dues, and Party departments at all levels must handle this conscientiously. (3) Comrades should earnestly research laws and regulations based on the political program and policies, respect laws and regulations, and implement laws and regulations. (4) We should complete the work of building a new China with a spirit of self-reliance. Party departments and members at all levels should pay special attention to the politics, economy, education, and construction of the recovered areas, making them experimental zones of the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The closing ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session was held in an extremely harmonious atmosphere at 6 PM on the 13th. The President, radiant and beaming, fully displayed his satisfaction and joy at the successful conclusion of the meeting. In his short closing remarks, the President, in addition to praising the achievements of the meeting, emphasized the importance of self-reliance in stabilizing social order and establishing an economic foundation. Regarding the transformation of the Party, the President instructed: A. The spiritual transformation should be pragmatic, self-disciplined, frugal, loving, respectful, knowing shame, trustworthy, and harmonious. B. The transformation of action requires the establishment of cadre education, the establishment of cadre policies, and the mobilization of young people to engage in social movements. We should not be afraid of the Communists. The Communists are destroyers of history and society. Their communism is nothing but deceiving themselves. Finally, the President declared again: The urgent tasks at present are: (1) To conduct a general registration of party members; (2) Party fees should be borne by party members themselves, and a party fee fundraising committee should be established. At the same time, to rescue and provide preferential treatment to the families of deceased martyrs, a public fundraising committee should be prepared; (4) Student movement guidance committees should be organized in large cities where schools are located; (4) Party members should go to the front lines to serve, and the party's organizational changes are significant and should be transferred.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Declaration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Joint Conference of the Central Party and Youth League is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Kuomintang by the President to lead the National Revolution, what we have inherited is the historical mission of China. Whenever the nation and the people entrust the party with a major historical mission, the Party will have a new review, a new unity, to form a new formation to undertake this new mission.</p>
<p>Before the founding of the Republic of China, the President reorganized the Revive China Society into the Revolutionary Alliance. As a result, the Republic of China was born. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang was reorganized into the Chinese Revolutionary Party. As a result, Yuan Shikai's monarchy was overthrown and peace was rebuilt. In the thirteenth year, the Chinese Kuomintang was reorganized. As a result, warlords were eliminated and the great cause of the Northern Expedition's unification was completed. In the twenty-seventh year, the various major decisions of the Party's Provisional National Congress and the establishment of the Three Principles of the People Youth League gloriously achieved the victory of more than eight years of arduous resistance against Japan. Now, history has entrusted the Party with the great responsibility of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation after World War II. Therefore, the Party has decided to unify the Party and Youth League organization. This measure follows the President's past experience in improving revolutionary organizations, uniting comrades, concentrating forces, unifying command, rebuilding the foundation of the revolution, strengthening the Party's ideological leadership, and promoting the Party's revolutionary spirit, in order to jointly accomplish this extraordinary and arduous task and achieve the tasks of the later revolution.</p>
<p>The history of the past fifty years shows us that the Party has overthrown autocracy, established the Republic of China, eliminated warlords, abolished unequal treaties, and completed the major historical events such as the victory of the War of Resistance. For the principles of nationalism and democracy, these are obviously major achievements. Over the years, the establishment of people's representative organs at all levels, and the recent promulgation of the Constitution and the end of political tutelage, are sufficient to show the Party's consistent efforts and continuous progress in order to complete democratic politics with determination and sincerity. Suppressing the rebellion and general mobilization is to maintain the unity and integrity of the country's territorial sovereignty, which is a key to national survival and world peace. As for the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, it was originally the main purpose of the Party's revolution. Relieving the suffering of the people's lives is an urgent need at present. In the past, there were originally fewer achievements in the construction of people's livelihood. The eight years of war and the post-war devastation and destruction have made it even more incomplete. Therefore, the economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood should be restarted and cannot be delayed. All construction undertakings should first of all do their best. The Party is willing to take this as the goal of its current efforts and struggle.</p>
<p>We recognize the difficulties of the current revolutionary environment, but we must also recognize that our revolutionary power is stronger than any previous revolutionary stage. In the past, our weak revolutionary forces were still able to overcome the difficulties of each stage. From now on, as long as we are self-respecting but not arrogant, self-reflecting but not discouraged, self-confident but not complacent, we will definitely be able to protect ourselves through historical precedent and achieve our expected goals.</p>
<p>We must understand that those who cannot be self-reliant and strive for improvement are not revolutionary political parties, and those who cannot withstand slander and cannot endure suffering are not revolutionary party members. We are willing to promote the Party's rebirth with the Party's unity and struggle, to create the driving force of the revolution with the Party's rebirth, and to achieve a comprehensive reform of politics and economy with the driving force of the revolution.</p>
<p>We appreciate the ancient Chinese saying two thousand years ago that "governing is not about talking a lot, but about how well you carry it out." From now on, we are willing to answer expectations with facts and prove our determination with action.</p>
<p>We must not hesitate to sacrifice to protect the survival of the nation, strive for the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, and work hard to improve the people's lives.</p>
<p>The country has moved towards the era of constitutionalism, but the responsibility of protecting the Republic of China and safeguarding the Chinese nation is the Party and its comrades' inescapable duty. We are willing to encourage ourselves with this and encourage each other, and we are more willing for our compatriots across the country to share our common national concept and national consciousness, to join hands with us, and to jointly build our new China of the Three Principles of the People.</p>

<h3>Telegram of Appreciation to Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Party and Youth League Joint Conference passed a telegram of appreciation to the soldiers throughout the country, with the following original text:</p>
<p>To all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army: After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communists took advantage of the post-war devastation to disrupt peace and launch a full-scale rebellion. The government, in order to save the lives of the people and protect their survival, issued a clear order to mobilize to suppress the rebellion.

<h3>Bao Sui Department Major General Senior Staff Officer Yuan Chonggu Embezzles Enemy Property, Military-Official Inspection Group Breaks Case Based on Tip-Off</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The Military-Official Inspection Group has broken another major case. Yuan Chonggu, a senior staff officer of the Bao Sui Department, and Zhao Yingda, the leader of the third group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, have been arrested. Yuan Chonggu came to Beiping after the victory and held this position. He had previously embezzled three enemy-owned houses in the names of He Wanghui, valued at over 50 gold bars. Recently, the inspection group secretly investigated and found that these three houses were all properties of the Japanese Toyo Textile Company. One of the houses was purchased in the name of He Wanghui through forgery. Yuan claimed that He Wanghui was his wife and purchased the property during the occupation period (Year 28 of the Republic of China). It was later forcibly occupied by the Japanese, and he requested the Handling Bureau to return it. The Handling Bureau returned it as requested. After the inspection group learned of the inside story based on a tip-off, it sent police and military police today to arrest Yuan. Yuan resisted arrest, claiming that He Wanghui was his first wife and had returned to his hometown of Binjiang in Northeast China, and that his current wife was "Anti-Japanese wife" Zhuang Youqing, thus determining that the so-called He Wanghui was not a real person. The inspection group believes that the Handling Bureau's "return" of enemy property in this way is highly suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty, so it sent Yuan to the military law office of the Xingyuan for prosecution and simultaneously sent Zhao Yingda to the court.</p>
<h3>Two Demons Arrested in the Nanjing Massacre Case</h3>
<p>Will Be Handed Over by Japan to Nanjing and Shenyang for Interrogation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] When the Japanese army invaded the capital in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese commander Tani Hisao allowed his subordinates to massacre our innocent people, which was extremely tragic. At that time, some Japanese soldiers used the massacre as a competition, and two lieutenants set the highest record for killing people, one killing 106 people and the other killing 105 people, truly demons among humans. The Japanese army was proud of this, and the Japanese newspapers greatly publicized it and published their photos. After the efforts of our military delegation stationed in Japan, the two demons, Noda Tsuyoshi and Mukai Toshiaki, were finally arrested in Tokyo and will be sent to Nanjing for public trial.</p>
<h3>Authoritative Sources Discuss the Peace Treaty with Japan: Attention Should Be Paid to Voting Methods; "Four Power Consent" is the Most Appropriate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] On the 13th, a certain authoritative source, in a casual conversation with a reporter regarding the Japanese peace treaty, stated that regarding the voting rights at the peace conference, we should firmly insist on maintaining the original proposal of the United Nations Charter, namely the consent of the four major powers, or the so-called right of veto by one nation. It is claimed that: the peace treaty with Japan concerns our country's recent development and future survival to a greater extent than any other nation. If there is even one clause or item in the treaty that hinders our country's development or endangers our country's survival, we cannot agree. Without our country's consent, the peace treaty cannot be established. The two-thirds voting system proposed by the United States and endorsed by the British Canberra Conference violates the United Nations Charter. Secondly, our country is weak and isolated, unlike the many countries of the British and American blocs. We must guard against the possibility that the nations participating in the peace conference, due to differing interests and a lack of concern, will vote in a manner detrimental to our country. In order to uphold the Charter and protect our interests, we should not shy away from seeming to align with the Soviet Union and firmly advocate for the consent of the four major powers, that is, the right of veto by one nation. As for the rumored proposal by our country to amend the American suggestion to "a two-thirds voting system but with the consent of the three major powers," that is also too risky. In the event that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, due to aligned interests, were to sacrifice our country, wouldn't we be hoist by our own petard? To cite a real-world example, we advocate setting Japan's industrial level at the standard of 1928 to 1930, while the Soviet Union advocates for the standard of 1930 to 1934, which aligns with the American position. Therefore, we must not make such a risky suggestion. Furthermore, the source also advocated that we should firmly advocate for the abolition of the Japanese Emperor system and that, regarding Japanese territory, we should insist on delineating its mainland territory according to the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement. As for the islands near the mainland, the maximum extent should be the islands over which the MacArthur Headquarters stipulated Japan's exercise of administrative power in its order of January 29, 1946. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, the source believes that the Pauley reparations plan should be the minimum.</p>

At the same time, they are thoroughly destroying roads and burying many mines in an attempt to impede the army's advance. Therefore, the National Army is advancing steadily and cautiously, gradually advancing according to the pre-determined plan.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Minister Bai's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session (Continued 2)</h3>
<p>(5) Improvement of Conscription Facilities: Conscription is normally a matter of domestic affairs in other countries, but in our country it is still a major military and political priority, as well as a matter of close relations between this Ministry and the people. This Ministry has paid special attention to it. The improvements regarding conscription work and the "Improvement of Conscription Facilities During the Period of Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion" are outlined below: (1) Revision of Conscription Laws and Regulations: 233 types of laws and regulations have been revised and consolidated into 24 types to form a systematic and complete set of conscription laws and regulations. (2) Adjustment of Conscription Agencies: In April of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), all old division garrison districts were abolished in preparation for the establishment of several new division garrison districts and regiment garrison districts. As of the end of August this year, 57 division garrison districts and 181 regiment garrison districts have been established, excluding bandit areas. The original 17 military garrison districts have been increased by two, the Jiangsu-Shandong Military Garrison Districts, for a total of 19. (3) Improvement of Garrison District Personnel: A conscription research class has been established at the Central Training Corps, which has held three sessions, graduating a total of 626 general- and colonel-level students who have been assigned to garrison districts to take on senior work. (4) Conscription Situation: The average allocation ratio is 1.5 per thousand of the population. (5) Implementation of Normal Conscription: The standard is to conscript those who have reached the age of twenty. If this is not enough, the age range will be extended, but not exceeding twenty-five. Except for special areas and special forces, unauthorized recruitment is strictly prohibited. (6) Due to the large number of exemptions and deferments in major cities, volunteers are conscripted first, and then conscription is carried out if this is not enough. (7) Conscription fees have been increased to 30,000 yuan per person, and settlement allowance is 50,000 yuan per person, and local fundraising for preferential treatment funds and grain has been launched. (8) Barracks are either repaired or built by various garrison districts and local governments, or ancestral halls and temples are used, and sleeping in the open and forcibly occupying civilian houses is prohibited. (9) New recruits are distributed clothing according to quotas, and competitions for officer-soldier care and denunciation of abuse are implemented. As a result, this year's conscription has been smooth, with 99% of the quota being conscripted, and the proportion of deserters and illnesses en route is less than 2%.</p>
<p>(6) Establishment of Second-Line Army Corps: In accordance with the General Mobilization Order, in addition to strengthening the first-line army corps, it is still necessary to actively establish second-line army corps. Measures have been drafted and are being implemented separately.</p>
<p>(7) Strengthening of Local Self-Defense Weapons: This Ministry has always attached great importance to cultivating local armed forces. As of June this year, weapons have been allocated to local teams and police in various provinces across the country, including rifles, light and heavy machine guns, and other handheld machine guns, pistols, grenade launchers, mortars, etc., in large numbers. The principle of allocation is to make full use of civilian firearms by the people's self-defense forces in various regions as much as possible, and to allocate ammunition and captured weapons according to their actual needs. The weapons for the security teams in each province are allocated to the extent that they meet the authorized strength. In fact, weapons have already been fully allocated in important provinces, and more than 60% have been filled in secondary provinces. A review has been conducted and a replenishment plan has been formulated, which is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>(8) Distribution of Japanese Warships: Since the surrender of Japan, all Japanese warships have been disarmed by the Allied forces. Among them, battleships, aircraft carriers, and submarines have been sunk by the United States. Those below destroyers were divided equally among China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the allocation was determined by drawing lots. China received eight ships each in the first, second, and third batches, for a total of 24 ships. However, the Japanese warships received this time were mostly produced during the war, and their structures were relatively simple. All weapons and telecommunications equipment were completely destroyed when Japan surrendered. Some have been repaired and completed, and some are still under renovation. As soon as they are completed, they will be formed into squadrons and put into service. C. Promotion of Institutions</p>
<p>Institutions are the foundation of army building, a major plan for centuries. Although the focus is currently on suppressing bandits, we have not neglected the future, so we are still paying attention to establishing institutions and intensifying their promotion to lay a permanent foundation for the national army. The following are a few important points:</p>
<p>(1) Personnel System: The reform of the personnel system is aimed at coordinating with the reorganization of the army to suppress rebellion, eliminating old habits, in order to improve the quality of national army cadres and increase the combat power of the national army. The following is recorded: 1. Layered Responsibility: In the past, all official performance evaluations, awards, and punishments in the national army were handled centrally by the Military Affairs Commission. Although the control was strict, the assessment was difficult. After the establishment of this Ministry, in order to be realistic and strengthen the responsibilities and powers of each level, a layered responsibility system was adopted. The Measures for the Division of Responsibilities for the Personnel Work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were formulated. This Ministry only controls the allocation of personnel and positions, as well as the appointment, dismissal, assessment, and rewards of generals. The transfer and assessment of personnel below the rank of colonel are authorized to the commanders-in-chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the directors of the Headquarters and the pacification commissioners, to be handled and reported for record. In addition, the retirement system is the most effective way to maintain the vigor of the army. It not only allows the cadres at all levels of the active military to constantly metabolize and improve their quality and morale, but also reserves a large number of reserve officers, making it easier to replenish them in wartime. Therefore, after the establishment of this Ministry, it overcame all difficulties and strived to implement this good system. (End of incomplete)</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>"Today" and "China"</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Pu'an often advocated a slogan in his later years: "Stand on the point of today to read ancient Chinese books; stand on the point of China to read foreign books!"</p>
<p>He often mentioned this slogan in conversations and also wrote it in his articles. This was a result of his seventy years of research and contemplation.</p>
<p>My association with Elder Pu was relatively long, and we got along very well. Ultimately, this was only because of our shared thoughts. And the core of our thinking, it can be said, is the slogan he advocated above.</p>
<p>This slogan of his is about how to read. The meaning of reading is originally very broad. If we put it more abstractly, we can say: "Stand at the forefront of the times to study inherent academic thoughts and cultural systems; stand on the nation's standpoint to study world trends and the cultural systems of various countries." If we say it this way, it can be generally applied and become a proposition. This is Mr. Hu's proposition, and also our proposition.</p>
<p>Currently, when scholars in general express their views on the relationship between the times and the nation, they often fail to make balanced arguments and lean towards one extreme: those who emphasize the times kick aside the nation, and those who emphasize the nation discard the times. In reality, the relationship between the times and the nation is like a cross, and we live at the intersection of this cross: we can neither abandon the nation nor cast aside the times.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Mr. Hu said in his "Pu'anism" article: "Stand on the point of the present to read ancient books, and constantly and in everything reflect on oneself and put it into practice. The Doctrine of the Mean in the Book of Rites says, 'Above, Zhongni (Confucius) revered Yao and Shun, and modeled themselves on King Wen and King Wu; above, they followed the seasons of Heaven; below, they conformed to the waters and lands.' To revere Yao and Shun is to uphold the morality of sages; to model themselves on King Wen and King Wu is to follow the laws of the nation; to follow the seasons of Heaven is to know the existence of time; to conform to the waters and lands is to know the existence of space. To uphold morality while following the laws prevents one from becoming a pedant; to follow the laws while upholding morality prevents one from becoming a harsh legalist. To exist in space while knowing the existence of time prevents one from becoming an ancient person in modern China; to remember space while existing in time prevents one from becoming a foreigner in modern China."</p>
<p>The last two sentences are the most insightful and hit the nail on the head. Now, let's first focus on the point of time and explain it further.</p>
<p>Time is like an unbreakable line that stretches infinitely. The present is contained within the past, and the past is left behind in the present. However, human life evolves step by step with the progress of the times. Initially, it was the Stone Age, then the Bronze Age, then the Iron Age, and now we are applying atoms. In the Stone Age, stone tools were originally the best sharp weapons. Reading about the stone tools of the Stone Age is perfectly fine; but if we feel that the stone tools of the Stone Age are already perfect and don't want bronze tools, iron tools, or even atoms, then that is a big mistake. Because we have already progressed to the stage of atoms today, stone tools can only become antiques in museums and can no longer be used as sharp weapons. All academic systems, thoughts, and arts, although different from tools, also progress with the times. No matter how wonderful the academic systems, thoughts, and arts of the past are, because of the evolution of the times, there will always be aspects that are not suitable for the times. Anything that is no longer suitable for the times should be discarded and need not be retained. Unfortunately, most people who read ancient books accept the contents of ancient books unconditionally and want to apply everything in ancient books to the present, which is a big mistake. Mr. Pu'an, in his article on Confucian self-cultivation methods, taught people the method of reading: "When learning from books, start with doubt. There are two doubts: first, doubt the book; second, doubt the principle. To doubt the book is to doubt errors in the editions or errors in the records. To doubt the principle is to doubt misunderstandings in interpretations and changes in the times."</p>
<p>His advocacy of standing on the point of the present to read ancient books is to tell people who read ancient books not to forget what era it is now and to accept everything in ancient books without any criticism or selection. Ancient books should be read, they must be read. Without reading ancient books, one would not know the traces of our country and society, or the path of development of thought and scholarship. However, one must wear the glasses of the times when reading ancient books, and stand in the present to criticize the strengths and weaknesses of ancient cultural systems, etc., in order to make choices and adopt them for today's use. Moreover, in the past, China was closed off, and the country's academic thoughts could still reliably control the country through the power of tradition; now that communication is developed and the world is a family, the academic thoughts, cultural systems, etc. of various countries in the world are pouring in, and it is impossible to resist them. Therefore, to read ancient Chinese books from the point of today, to put it in more detail, is to compare the academic thoughts of various countries in the world today with Chinese academic thoughts: see which kinds of Chinese academic thoughts are no longer suitable for today, and put them aside; which kinds are still superior to others and are extremely applicable to today, then make great efforts to promote and develop them. In short: time is urging China to modernize, and readers must also modernize, and by no means become people in books and turn into ancient people in modern China.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Time is urging China to modernize, which is undoubtedly true. However, "modernization" is not equal to "foreignization" — neither "Sovietization" nor "Americanization" nor "Britishization." On the contrary, it is to select and absorb all the modern cultural systems, etc. of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and other countries in the world to suit the environment and history of the Chinese nation. In other words, it is to absorb modern cultural systems, academic thoughts that are suitable for China for one's own use, and transform them into "Chinese" cultural systems and academic thoughts. However, those who talk about modernization today often forget this principle. Seeing the success of the United States, they want to move everything from the United States to China for implementation, regardless of whether it is good or bad. It is only a pity that the Chinese moon can never become the American moon. Seeing the success of the Soviet Union, they want to move everything from the Soviet Union to small countries for implementation, drinking vodka, carrying the signboard of Gorky, and wearing embroidered shirts, they still feel that they are not Sovietized enough, and they only want Nanjing to become Insk and Shanghai weather to be as cold as Leningrad. As a result, in schools and on the streets, we only see Chinese people whose souls have entered the Soviet or American nationality, and not a single real Chinese person. As a result, because the democracy of the Soviet Union is different from the democracy of Britain and the United States, our compatriots with Soviet nationality are waging war on the battlefield, and in the rear, in publications and at meetings, they are also desperately engaging in "theoretical struggles," pre-determining a set of theories to forcibly install future facts. The fierceness of the battle is beyond description, but these "foreigners in modern China" die without realizing it, even die without regret!</p>
<p>If today's China, everyone can exist in space while knowing the existence of time, not becoming ancient people in modern China; remember space while existing in time, not becoming foreigners in modern China, everyone becomes a modern Chinese person, a modern person in China; then the internal chaos in today's China can certainly be calmed down immediately, all modern construction in China can certainly be carried out immediately, and the realm of peace and happiness will certainly begin to enter China immediately!</p>

<h3>Amidst Calls for Preliminary Peace Talks with Japan, the Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies His Position, Requests the Current Cabinet to Attend the Peace Conference, and Hopes that All Eleven Allied Nations Will Participate in the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama declared on the 13th that his Socialist cabinet is prepared to attend the peace conference as a true representative of the Japanese people, and requests that all countries show trust in Japan's efforts toward democratization. Katayama, who assumed the position of Prime Minister on June 1st, held his first press conference today. He stated, "We will do our best to make Japan a democratic country. What we are concerned about is the future of Japan, not the mistakes of Japan's past, but we will prohibit all actions that could easily cause misunderstanding by other countries." He stated that the government will strive to select a delegation of representatives who understand new democratic methods, have the trust of labor, and are deeply aware of the social and cultural problems of Japan, to participate in the peace conference. The current situation has not yet reached the time to select this delegation. However, at the end of the press conference, Cabinet Secretary-General Nishio, who holds an important position in the Socialist Party, was designated by Prime Minister Katayama as the natural candidate to represent Japan at the peace conference. Nishio stated that the delegation should provide assurances "not to cause any more disputes and not to provoke war again." He also said that the Socialist Party does not oppose including opposition party candidates in the delegation, but insists that the Katayama cabinet itself is the most reasonable choice. Katayama smiled and said that Nishio's nomination of him was quite unexpected, but he would reserve comment on the matter for the time being. Katayama acknowledged hearing rumors of the formation of a new conservative party, the purpose of which is to deal with the peace conference, but he believed it was not necessary. Although he did not name names, he was clearly referring to former Prime Minister Yoshida. Katayama stated that he would not attend the peace conference if China did not participate, and he did not want to comment on the news of separate peace treaties. He only stated, "China and Japan are neighboring countries with historical interrelationships, and China will naturally have a deep understanding of Japan."</p>
<p>He stated that he and his government have not yet made recommendations to the Allied nations regarding the minimum conditions required for Japan's peaceful era. He is not prepared to discuss what form of control Japan will need after the peace treaty is signed. As for the treaty, Japan is not qualified to make suggestions, but is willing to abide by the actions of the Allied nations. He stated that the Japanese cabinet fervently hopes that the peace treaty can be signed by all eleven relevant countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, he released the following points regarding domestic affairs: (1) To achieve its black market control policy within three and a half months. He estimates that the number of black market operators has been reduced by one-third of the previous number. The government's emergency economic recovery plan has been effective, and prices are already showing a downward trend. (2) Thanks to Allied relief, the food situation has significantly improved. The government is formulating a new grain collection and main food distribution plan, to be implemented in November. (3) Regarding the final revision of the cabinet's economic concentration exclusion plan, it is scheduled to be passed by the cabinet on September 16th and submitted to parliament.</p>
<h3>Hitoshi Ashida Again Criticizes the Economic Policies of the Katayama Cabinet</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Japanese Democratic Party convened a policy research committee on the 12th, and also held a standing directors meeting. President Ashida, in view of the recent political trends unfavorable to Katayama, again used his speculative methods to re-express his attitude on various important issues: (1) On the issue of coal mine nationalization, which had already been passed in the cabinet meeting on the 5th, he now raises a major amendment on whether the nature of the council should be a decision-making body. (2) On the issue of long-term economic policy, he believes that according to Nishio's remarks, it is completely a socialist policy, which is contrary to the four-party policy agreement, and expresses absolute opposition.</p>
<h3>Japanese Exports of Cotton Textiles Exceed $100 Million in Value</h3>

<h3>The Allied Headquarters Presents a Report on Opening Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] The Control Council will have its chairman, Sebald, read a preliminary report on reopening private trade with Japan next Wednesday. The report, which was submitted to the council on MacArthur's recommendation, will be the first report presented by the Allied Headquarters since the opening of private trade with Japan on August 15th. The former chairman of the Control Council, Acheson, had a dispute with the Soviet representative for refusing to provide the Soviet representative with detailed information on this issue.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Air Force Announces the Cause of Acheson's Death</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The Army Air Force Special Committee, which investigated the cause of the death of Acheson, chairman of the Control Council for Japan, last month, submitted a report today, believing that the modified B-17 bomber had too much power and the engine consumed too much gasoline, so that it could not complete the flight from Guayaulin to Honolulu. The pilot of the plane had 3,500 hours of flying experience, of which 600 hours were in B-17s. The report did not explain why the plane missed the refueling station.</p>
<h3>The Indian Constitutional Assembly Decides to Postpone Its Meeting</h3>
<p>The Government Is Busy Dealing with Mass Conflicts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 12th] The Indian government has stepped up its work to deal with mass conflicts and refugee problems. The Indian Constitutional Assembly has decided to postpone its meeting until October 11th. The All-India Congress Committee has also decided to postpone its meeting. Military officers of all ranks are not allowed to take leave. The government has canceled all holidays (including Sundays). Martial law is in effect in various districts of Delhi for six to fourteen hours. More stores have opened, and a small number of banks have begun operating under heavy guard. Muslim refugees are still in concentration camps. Gandhi visited the concentration camps today. Several prominent Muslim leaders (including former Indian Governor-General's Executive Council member Azad) have taken refuge in the homes of Nehru and Azad.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Delegation Convenes a Meeting of the UN General Assembly, Marshall Directs Strategy, and Limiting the Veto Power of Major Powers Will Inevitably Be Opposed by the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Because the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open next Tuesday, Secretary of State Marshall convened a series of meetings with his ten-member delegation today to decide on the policies that the United States should adopt on the issues of the Balkans, Palestine, and the veto power, and will formally appoint representatives to attend the various committees of the General Assembly. According to a U.S. spokesman, Marshall, with so many important issues, did not want to bear the burden alone in the political committee of 55 participating countries, and will appoint other representatives to participate in the discussion of various special issues. Seeing that Marshall has personally instructed the strategy here, it shows that the United States attaches great importance to this session of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 12th] Marshall is preparing to speak twice next week. The first speech will be on Sunday night, for the National United Nations Celebration Week of the United Nations Association of the United States; the second will be on Wednesday to the regular session of the General Assembly. Marshall is expected to summarize the United States' policy toward the United Nations General Assembly in these two speeches, and the fact that Marshall is personally serving as the head of the U.S. delegation can also be seen as proof that the United States is strengthening its support for the United Nations after criticizing the slow action of the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 13th] Well-informed sources said that the Soviet Union will oppose any attempt to limit the veto power at this session of the UN General Assembly, and will condemn the United States' policies in Indonesia and Korea. Regarding the Korean part, the Soviet Union will submit a long document, based on Molotov's recent note to Marshall, accusing the U.S. authorities of destroying democratic elements. In addition, the Soviet Union will strongly support India's accusation of South Africa's discrimination against Indians.</p>
<h3>The Greek Parliament Passes Amnesty Law for Guerrillas After Heated Debate, Limiting One Month for Voluntary Surrender</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 13th] The Greek Parliament passed an amnesty law for guerrillas this morning, stipulating that if they surrender to the government within one month, they will be given leniency and their past actions will not be held against them. The case had previously been fiercely debated. As a result of reconsideration, a motion to shorten the deadline to half a month was rejected. After it is published in the government gazette, military aircraft will carry proclamations to guerrilla-controlled areas and drop them, urging voluntary disarmament.</p>
<h3>The United States Accuses the Soviet Union of Obstructing the Work of the Security Council</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The State Department released a white paper tonight on the United Nations organization and the Greek issue, accusing the Soviet Union of obstructing the clear will of the vast majority of the Security Council, and accusing Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia of delaying, undermining, and preventing the investigation work of the UN Balkan Committee, and engaging in affirmative encouragement and assistance to the guerrilla bands in Greece. The publication of this document, on the eve of the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Greek issue, is intended to reiterate the warning recently made by U.S. representative Johnson. Johnson had stated that the United States would use all means within the scope of the United Nations Charter to maintain international peace and provide protection to Greece.</p>
<h3>European Customs Union, The European Economic Conference Announces That It Will Begin Research Immediately, and the Soviet Union and Other Countries Will Also Be Invited to Participate</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 12th] The European Economic Conference announced tonight that it will conduct research to establish a European customs union, in which the countries concerned will give up economic independence for the sake of common welfare. Tariffs should be abolished between the member countries of the union, complete free trade should be maintained, and a common tariff policy should be adopted towards countries outside the union. The Soviet Union and 15 other countries will also be invited to participate in the research work, which is the first attempt in Europe to make up for the East-West divide since the Eastern European bloc rejected the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>The countries invited, in addition to the Soviet Union, include Belarus, Ukraine, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and the Free Territory of Trieste. In addition, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland have all attended the Paris Economic Conference, but have not yet participated in the customs union research group. Those who have already participated are the 13 countries of the European Economic Conference: Britain, France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Among them, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have already established a customs union, have considerable experience in this type of organization, and are willing to take on the role of initiator of the European Customs Union research body. When the proposal to organize a European Customs Union was first put forward in Paris, Britain did not commit itself. It is said that it is necessary to obtain the consent of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Pakistan before deciding whether to participate or not.</p>
<h3>Britain Suggests Investigating the Number of Troops in Various Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 12th] British representative Cadogan today proposed in a secret meeting of the General Disarmament Committee that the existing military strength of various countries be investigated to establish international confidence. He stated that the British government felt that there were several major obstacles to the prospect of disarmament, but that preliminary measures could be taken. The first step should be to send a circular to the 55 member states, requesting them to report the number of troops and to provide United Nations organizations with the convenience of reviewing such reports.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 12th] The chairman of the European Economic Cooperation Committee, Franks, told reporters that the sixteen-country conference may not be able to complete its final report until September 22nd, a week later than the original deadline.

These six points are: (1) General issues concerning internal fiscal and monetary stability; (2) Common goals and principles; (3) Trade and reducing trade barriers; (4) Heavy equipment; (5) Major production plans proposed by participating countries; (6) What kind of agency will accept and implement U.S. assistance.</p>

This action was passed by a two-thirds majority vote, with the aim of making the Food and Agriculture Organization more effective in all activities related to world food.</p>
<h3>The Italian Left Again Raises a Motion of No Confidence in the Government, The Communist Party Seeks to Seize Italy for the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Rome, 12th] Italian left-wing leaders submitted their second motion of no confidence in the Gasperi government on the 12th, but again warned that if the domestic situation in Italy does not change, they will use force to overthrow the government of the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th] Diplomats here declared today that the Italian Communist Party, under the direction of Moscow, has launched the "Battle for Italy." This battle has been waiting for an opportunity for a long time, and the crisis it will cause will make the U.S. aid plan too slow to help. The spread of the million-man labor tide of Italian farmers and workers, the Socialists' request for a vote of no confidence in the Gasperi government, and other recent developments all appear to be part of the Communist movement to overthrow the government and seize Italy for the Soviet Union. There is a very high possibility of civil war in Italy. The harsh conditions of the Italian peace treaty have caused deep unrest in the Italian political situation, and the future withdrawal of U.S. troops will have a great impact on the northeastern region of the country. The people of this region are forced by the provisions of the treaty to leave their hometowns and move into the new demilitarized zone, ceding to neighboring countries the territories they acquired after the First World War. The Communist Party claims to have concentrated its forces in the Po River Valley in northern Italy, making Italians more afraid of Yugoslavia.</p>
<h3>U.S. Fleet Visits Turkey</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 12th] The U.S. fleet is currently making its fourth visit to Turkey in a year and a half. The aircraft carrier "Leyte" and five cruisers arrived in Izmir this morning.</p>
<h3>Bismarck's Jewelry Stolen</h3>

Some of the jewelry bears the name of former Romanian Queen Marie and was stored with Bismarck's genealogy and other treasures and money in a large box under the bed.</p>
<h3>Latin America Opposes Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Unconfirmed reports say that Latin American representatives attending the annual meeting of the International Bank and Monetary Fund have decided to oppose continued loans to European countries, on the grounds that the European sixteen-country conference discussing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe has extended its session, so none of the sixteen countries can be considered worth risking for. Latin American representatives neither confirmed nor denied the previous statement.</p>
<h3>Belgium and Australia Invite the United States to Participate in Mediating the Dispute between India and the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Consular Conference to Be Held in Batavia</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 13th] The three-nation committee mediating the dispute between India and the Netherlands has been designated by both India and the Netherlands as Australia and Belgium. The two countries are currently selecting the third country, and the United States is the most promising candidate. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt had a long talk with the Belgian representative on the evening of the 12th, reportedly to discuss inviting the United States to participate in the mediation committee.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Batavia, 13th] British Consul Lambert in Batavia, Australian Consul Eaton, Chinese Consul-General Jiang Jiadong, and Belgian Consul-General Van der Stichelen have all returned to Batavia after inspecting the Dutch military zone. It is expected that a consular conference will be held this weekend.</p>
<h3>Several European and Asian Countries Purchasing Military Equipment from the US</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Boston, 12th] Mr. Johnson, General Manager of the Owen Machine Company, the largest automatic weapons factory in the United States, revealed on the 12th that several foreign government agencies are currently in contact with the United States to purchase weapons. He has concluded meetings with agencies from Europe, the Near East, and the Far East. Johnson also stated that the Soviet Union has decided to attempt to control all of Asia and Europe, while the United States and Britain, and perhaps other countries, are convinced that the Soviet Union does not intend to control Asia and Europe. Soviet intrusion can only be prevented by each country strengthening its armed forces and resisting with organized and planned efforts.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The State Department is maintaining a rather calm attitude regarding the rumored negotiations between several foreign governments and the United States for the purchase of large quantities of military equipment. According to a spokesperson, the Department's Munitions Control Board has absolute control over all exports of weapons or ammunition from the United States. Each time a munitions dealer wishes to export any war weapons to a foreign government, the exported weapons items must be cleared by the Board. There are no fixed regulations for arms export control; each case is considered individually. The export permits issued by the Board to munitions dealers are valid for one shipment only. Before making such a decision, consultation with the Army and Navy departments is required to seek their views on whether they have any objections to a particular country obtaining the weapons.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Demonstrate on Northern Iranian Border, Friction with Britain and the US over Oil Rights</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] Since the American Ambassador to Iran, Mr. Allen, expressed the United States' determination to support Iran against threats to its natural resources, including oil fields, it is reported that Soviet troops have intensified exercises along the Soviet-Iranian border. Visitors from northern Iran say that the sounds of Soviet tanks and intense machine gun fire can be heard from within Soviet territory at the border. It is now learned that three battalions of Iranian mechanized forces have been dispatched to the northern border area to stand guard. It should be noted that although the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was signed in April of last year, it still awaits ratification by the Iranian parliament before it can take effect. When the agreement was signed, Soviet troops were still stationed in the Azerbaijan province of northern Iran. It is rumored that Iranian Prime Minister Sultanana intends to amend the agreement before submitting it to parliament for ratification.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 12th] Well-informed sources in diplomatic circles here state that Britain is prepared to consider making economic concessions to Iran in order to prevent the Soviet Union from carrying out political or economic encroachment in order to secure Iranian oil.</p>

<h3>A Group of Daughters Head to Serve in the Military, Detained at Xiaguan Station, Fifth Army Recruitment in Shanghai and Hangzhou Reveals Doubts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Peng Bolun, who claimed to be the secretary of the Fifth Army's Press Office, recruited over twenty female political workers in Shanghai and Hangzhou. At 7:15 AM on the 13th, they arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai and were detained at Xiaguan Station by the police and military police. The military police who carried out the inspection stated, "All military unit recruitment personnel must submit their credentials for approval by the Ministry of National Defense, but Mr. Peng was unable to produce such documentation." The military police detained Mr. Peng, and all the female students were sent to the Dahua Hotel for temporary accommodation. Among them, Wang Yanqing, Luo Yi, Wu Zhi, Shi [blank space], Wang Reina, and the other twenty-two who were Su Lvhua, Wang Peixiong, Zhu Youan, Li [blank space] Zhen, Zhu Fen, Qu Youwang, Chen Yaqing, Zhu Danping, Wang Yaxiong, Luo Jianshen, Zhao Hua, Meng Ying, Wang Ruijun, Wu Jingzhi, Lin Shuqing, Zhou Jingqiu, Zhuang Ying, Yu Hua, Du Xuming, Wang Lizhen, Zhu Jinling, Li Yu, those five who were in Shanghai were all the ones applying in Shanghai while the other twenty-two were the ones applying in Hangzhou. They were all young women around the age of twenty, most of whom were studying in middle school or were unemployed. When the reporter met them at the station, Peng Bolun, the leader, was being questioned by the police and military police. They were also gathered separately, discussing the suspicions they had encountered along the way. The reporter then interviewed several of them individually, asking about their reasons for applying and the process they had undergone. According to them, the biggest factor in their application was curiosity. At the same time, they all felt that it was a rare opportunity to go to work on the front lines, and it was explained during the recruitment that the training period before work would not exceed two months. Even within a month, if they felt that their life and work were not suitable, they could ask for leave to return home midway. If the work was suitable, they could continue working. On the recruitment booklet held by Peng Bolun, it was written that they were recruiting "Fifth Army News and Medical Personnel." They also said that there were many categories when applying, such as rural teaching, drama, music, medical care, etc., and they all applied according to their interests. Some of them expressed dissatisfaction with the suspicious attitudes of people along the way, believing that they were a formal organization, but they were constantly being obstructed and subjected to troublesome inquiries. Others expressed gratitude, as they themselves did not understand the plan for the future. According to the military police escorting them from Shanghai to Nanjing, their families were unwilling to let them leave when they boarded the train, which clearly indicated that there were still questions about the matter.</p>
<p>Recruitment Process in Shanghai and Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Fifth Army Press Office recruited news and medical personnel in Shanghai and Hangzhou last month. It was stipulated that unmarried women aged seventeen to thirty were eligible, and more than one hundred people went to report for the exam at one time. In the end, twenty-seven female students were admitted in Hangzhou and five female students were admitted in Shanghai, all of whom were young women aged about eighteen or nineteen. However, during the recruitment period, because they had not obtained contact with the local government, many of the female students' families opposed it afterward because they did not understand the truth, so many female students withdrew one after another.</p>
<p>Until the night before last, the above-mentioned twenty-seven female students from Hangzhou arrived in Shanghai by night train, and then transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai No. 12 night train to Nanjing. At that time, they were led by a military officer wearing a "Shanxi Security" symbol, who claimed to be Peng Bolun. Because the Railway Police Department and the Military Police Corps did not know about this in advance, they paid close attention along the way. When they arrived in Nanjing yesterday morning, the Military Police Corps inquired and found that the documents were insufficient, so they detained the persons in charge, Peng Bolun, Gu Yuxiang, Huang Zhaohua and the female students.</p>
<h3>Leader Impersonating</h3>
<p>After the military and police authorities investigated with the Fifth Army, it was heard that this was indeed the case, but because the person in charge, Peng Bolun, entrusted others to handle the recruitment in Shanghai and Hangzhou, there were many discrepancies in the procedures. The personnel who were entrusted were mostly unfamiliar with the situation of the Fifth Army, and in order to obtain convenience in action after the event, the leaders in Shanghai and Hangzhou impersonated Peng Bolun to carry out activities externally, so that when the military police inquired, there were many inconsistencies between the words and the facts, which caused people to have doubts.</p>
<p>The military officer Peng Bolun who led the female students to Nanjing in Shanghai, as was learned after investigation, was actually impersonated by a person named Gu Wangxiang, because Peng Bolun himself had already taken a train back to Beijing the night before. It is heard that after this incident occurred, the Shanghai side investigated and learned that when recruiting in Shanghai, the Fifth Army had sent an official letter to the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, entrusting it to assist in the process. However, the military police believe that at this time of national general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, if various agencies have similar enrollment events, it seems necessary to obtain close cooperation with the local government in advance, otherwise, if there is no organization, there is a risk of breeding malpractices.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Punishing Obstruction of Military Service Amended and Promulgated by the Ministry of National Defense</h3>

Now that the case has been judged by the High Court, the High Court notified the District Court to execute the verdict the day before yesterday afternoon. The Chief of the District Court sent a confidential letter to the District Procuratorate. In the afternoon of the same day, the Chief Clerk of the District Procuratorate led bailiffs to No. 18, Lane 131, Changshu Road, to arrest Yang Anren. After a brief questioning about his age and case details, he was detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center. The original text of the High Court's judgment is very long. The reasons for upholding the original verdict are that Yang and Lu had used their positions to collude for fraud and directly benefit themselves. It said: "It was found that in early February of this year, the price of gold soared. The 8th was the last day for the government to allocate gold to the gold industry. The Tongfengyu Gold Shop purchased 540 gold bars on that day. Among the 2.95335 billion yuan of notes delivered, 2.53335 billion yuan of notes were not exchanged on the same day, or a transfer application was obtained. They were stored in the treasury of the Central Bank by the Treasury Department, which has been admitted without denial. Judging from the circumstances, there was an obvious act of collusion for illicit purposes. The original trial was based on this to convict them, and there were no errors." Regarding Yang and Zhan's defense, it was rejected, saying: "The petitioners have been deliberately evasive, with nothing more than the intention of obtaining exemption from punishment, which is not sufficient to adopt."</p>

<h3>Li Zhuomin's Impeachment Letter Will Soon Be Published by the Control Yuan</h3>

<h3>Postal Workers' Treatment Will Not Be Reduced Again</h3>
<p>Statements from Persons in Charge of the Postal Workers' Union</p>
<p>Regarding the upcoming implementation of the measure stipulating that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises should not exceed 30% of the treatment of civil servants, news of this has caused a great reaction among personnel in various state-owned enterprises. According to persons in charge of the National Postal Workers' Union in Shanghai, the measure is only seen in the newspapers, and the nature, system, and employee welfare facilities of various state-owned enterprises are different. Enforcing uniformity in a rigid manner may cause many obstacles. Taking postal workers as an example, they have no welfare facilities such as dormitories or canteens, their salaries are low, and they have been reduced by 20% since July. Their lives are very difficult. If the treatment is reduced again, it will not only be unbearable for postal workers, but it will also be difficult to maintain the good service efficiency of today's postal service. Now the postal service is relying on the efforts of all postal workers to move towards reform. Therefore, it is believed that any measure that reduces the enthusiasm of postal workers and hinders the progress of the postal service will not be implemented in the postal service. If it is implemented, it will inevitably be strongly and effectively opposed by postal workers across the country, and the consequences will be borne by the authorities.</p>
<h3>General Manager of XINSUI Sued for Fraud</h3>

<h3>The Number of National Representatives and Legislative Committee Members for Commercial Groups: Four City Leaders Cable the Legislative Yuan to Suggest an Increase. The Shipping Association Also Submits Three More Reasons to Fight For It.</h3>
<p>Although the number of National Assembly representatives from national industrial and commercial groups has been approved by the State Council and increased from 31 to 68, the method of distribution will be determined by the Legislative Yuan. However, compared to the 134 representatives from agricultural groups and 126 from labor groups, it is still considered too few. Moreover, the original number of 15 legislative committee members has not been increased, so industrial and commercial groups still feel unsatisfied. It is now reported that the mayor of this city, Wu Guozhen, the speaker of the Municipal Council, Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Fang Zhi, and the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, have also jointly sent a letter to President Sun of the Legislative Yuan regarding the issue of the number of representatives, with the following original letter:</p>
<p>"To President Zhesheng: We have repeatedly learned from the newspapers about your discussions, promoting justice, saying what is difficult for others to say, and having the effect of shifting international attention. We admire your dedication and tireless efforts. We, the local officials in Shanghai, are in daily contact with people in industry and commerce and deeply understand the psychology of merchants. Since the beginning of constitutional governance, all citizens have the equal right to participate in politics. This time, the number of representatives allocated to commercial groups is too small, causing dissatisfaction from all parties. Summarizing the opinions from all sides, there are approximately four points:</p>
<p>The Consideration of Feelings and Reason Is Too Small</p>
<p>(1) The Founding Father advocated revolution and aimed at all citizens of the country. Therefore, our revolution is called a revolution of the whole people, and our politics is based on the happiness of the whole people. Government facilities have no class distinctions. This is what the Founding Father's teachings tell us, and this is also the legislative spirit of the Constitution, which needs no further explanation. Therefore, there is no doubt that commercial groups should enjoy equal electoral rights with all other groups in the country. (2) Among the agricultural, industrial, and commercial entities in our country, commercial groups have the most sound organization and the longest history, and the number of members is particularly large. Among all types of national entities, there are very few that can compete with them. According to the principles of elections, those with sound members and a large number of people should be given a relatively larger number of representatives, which is the right way to go. However, in the list of representative allocations passed by the Legislative Yuan, commercial groups only account for 13 National Assembly representatives and 5 legislative committee members, which is too small considering feelings and reason.</p>
<p>Lack of Standards Is Regrettable</p>
<p>(3) Even if we take a step back, the population participating in occupational elections and the number of representatives to be elected according to the Constitution should be distributed equally. Although Guo Zhen and others do not have precise statistics at hand for reference, it is certain that the number of representatives obtained by commercial groups is below the general level compared to the number of their members. To give another example, the number of members in some free professional groups is insufficient for the total number of legal signatures when candidates for National Assembly representatives register. Therefore, the distribution of the number of representatives in this occupational group election is not only particularly unfair but also flawed. (4) Furthermore, when checking the allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives for occupational groups, there were established rules to follow during the first National Assembly. In 1946, the revised and promulgated "National Assembly Representative Election Law" Appendix Three, commercial groups accounted for a total of 104 representatives, about one-third of the total number of industrial, agricultural, and commercial associations. Now, we are abandoning this basis and ignoring it, and making arbitrary and standardless allocations, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Merchants Are Enthusiastic About Participating in Politics</p>
<p>It is a good phenomenon in the constitutional process that merchants are enthusiastic about participating in politics. It is said that the esteemed court is about to negotiate a remedy, showing great impartiality and willingness to accept good advice, which is deeply admired by all Chinese people. It is suggested that the total number of National Assembly representatives for occupational groups was originally 450, and it is proposed to increase the total number to 500. In this way, the commercial groups, including the original 13 representatives, would have a total of 63 representatives. After each of the 35 provinces and 12 municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan receives one representative, the remaining 16 representatives can be allocated two each to the National Federation of Banking Associations and the National Federation of Shipping Associations. The remaining 14 can be used to increase the number of representatives based on the economic status and number of members of commercial groups in each province and city, to adapt to the actual situation.</p>
<p>Moderately Increase the Quota to Slightly Reassure the Public</p>
<p>The total number of legislative committee members for occupational groups was originally 84, and it is proposed to increase the total number to 90. In this way, the commercial groups, including the original 5 representatives, would have a total of 11 representatives. After the National Federation of Banking Associations and the National Federation of Shipping Associations each elect one representative, the remaining 9 representatives cannot be divided into regions due to the large number of units, and can only be jointly elected by national commercial groups. According to the above methods, the increase is limited, so it should not cause too much disruption and affect the entire case, but it is also sufficient to slightly reassure the public, so that the election will not be stalled in parts and hinder the overall situation. Knowing that this matter is subject to the balance of power, Guo Zhen and others are acting within the scope of their duties and should not overstep their authority. However, in view of the public's high expectations, we dare to fulfill our responsibility to express our opinions and feelings at the time of the negotiation and revision. We respectfully submit this letter, hoping that it will be reviewed, adopted, and deeply appreciated. We respectfully wish you well in your administration. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian respectfully."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shipping Association has been continuously sending telegrams to relevant ministries and departments to fight for three National Assembly representatives and legislative committee members. It is now learned that the association has reiterated three reasons, stating that the shipping industry is not comparable to ordinary commercial groups, and sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Organization, and other competent authorities, requesting: (1) The number of National Assembly and legislative committee members for commercial groups should be increased in proportion to the National Assembly and the previous National Assembly. (2) Allocate the number of representatives for the shipping industry from the number of representatives for commercial groups, and allow the shipping industry to elect independently.</p>

<h3>Chen Jinliang, Owner of the Huasheng Silk and Satin Factory, Was Kidnapped. Four Monks Are Suspected and Were Interrogated Yesterday. They Vehemently Denied Colluding with Bandits.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of a Putuo Mountain monk being accused of colluding with bandits, kidnapping, and extorting forty gold bars was initially heard yesterday by Judge Shao Renjie of the District Court. The case arose when Chen Jin, the owner of the Huasheng Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Factory in this city, and his granddaughter, Chen Ye, went to the Three Saints Hall on Putuo Mountain to perform Buddhist ceremonies. On the night of July 12, more than a dozen armed bandits suddenly came and entered Chen's bedroom by climbing over the window with ladders. In addition to looting all of Chen's luggage and clothes, they kidnapped him to Zhujiajian to hide him. Later, the bandits extorted forty gold bars. The abbot of the temple, Xingkong (also the abbot of the Shanghai Taiping Temple and Chongde Fuyuan Temple), the receptionist Xingxian, and the incense keepers Zhou Xiaoxiang and Jiang Shengquan, accompanied Tang Shanxing, a representative sent by the bandits, to Shanghai with Chen Jinliang's handwriting. They lived in the Taiping Temple and negotiated the ransom procedures with Chen's son, Minshan, resulting in the payment of 100 million yuan in cash and three gold bars. On the 23rd of the same month, Chen was released and returned home. When Xingxian and others were about to leave Shanghai, Chen reported to the Xincheng Police Station, which arrested Xingkong, Xingxian, Zhou Xiaoxiang, and others at the pier. Jiang Shengquan was arrested at the Taiping Temple. After interrogation, it was determined that Xingxian and others were suspected of colluding with the bandits and were directly transferred to the District Court for interrogation in accordance with Article 2, Item 9, and Article 5, Item 3, of the Regulations for Punishing Bandits. At the hearing yesterday, Chen Jinliang did not appear, and his son, Chen Minshan, appeared as his agent. He stated that his father had been friends with Xingkong for many years. This time, Xingkong accompanied him to Putuo and was kidnapped. Afterwards, the incense keeper Zhou Xiaoxiang and his daughter Chen Ye returned to Shanghai to explain the situation. They stated that when the bandits climbed over the window, his father was playing cards with Xingkong and others. The bandits' target was his father. After being kidnapped, he heard that he was being held on a small boat and went to Ningbo to visit friends to rescue him, but the pirates were too rampant and the military police were unable to help. The next day, he received a call from his home in Shanghai, informing him that his mother had returned to Shanghai and that bandits had accompanied the monks to Shanghai to negotiate the ransom. He did not want to meet with a third party. I disguised myself as a worker and negotiated with a bandit who called himself "A Wang" at the Taiping Temple. Seeing that my father's letter stated that they had agreed on 15 gold bars, I first handed over three gold bars and 100 million yuan in cash. There were still nine gold bars that I planned to pay at the Three Saints Hall in Putuo. The bandits agreed to release the person. At that time, the suppression of bandits in Zhenjiang was very tight, and the bandits fled in panic. My father was able to escape and return home. Later, the monk Xingkong confessed that he was the abbot of the Shanghai Taiping Temple, the Putuo Three Saints Hall, and the Chongde Fuyuan Temple. He became a monk at the age of 18. This time, Chen went to Putuo to hold a seven-day water and land ceremony. On the evening of July 12, at 11 o'clock, while he was playing cards with Chen, bandits broke in and kidnapped him. He admitted to the bandits and Chen's son negotiating the ransom at the Taiping Temple, but claimed that he did not collude with the bandits and was only working to help Chen. Xingxian confessed that he was the supervisor of the Chongde Fuyuan Temple and that he and Xingkong were like brothers. This time, he accompanied the bandits to Shanghai entirely to help Xingkong. Xingkong held concurrent positions at three temples and was busy with affairs. To take care of his brotherly relationship, he was willing to go through fire and water. He claimed that he was not present at the kidnapping and denied colluding with the bandits. The court showed him a receipt for the ransom, Xingxian said that this was the payment voucher set by the bandits. The court ordered the two monks to write in court to verify the handwriting. The incense keepers Cheng Shouzhi, Zhou Xiaoxiang, and Jiang Shengquan all vehemently denied colluding with the bandits. The court stated that the victim in this case, Chen Jinliang, had not appeared in court, and his testimony was important. He was ordered to report on time with his wife, Wang, at the next hearing. The two monks and Zhou and Jiang were still detained. It is reported that the bandit leaders in the kidnapping case, Zhou Honggen, Ao Kai, and others, have been captured by the Zhejiang Third District Security Command and executed on the spot. The bandit bases in Huludao and other places have been cleared.</p>
<h3>Woman Drugged in Coffee, Defrauded, and Wakes Up in Great Sorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Peizhen, a dancer from Jinshan Dance Hall, is 18 years old and from Suzhou. When the hall closed the night before last, she accepted an invitation from a dance patron, Qiu Dezhang (25 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 8, Lane 501, Dihua Road), to go to a nearby coffee shop. Unexpectedly, Qiu, seeing Huang's rich clothing, had evil intentions and secretly mixed sleeping pills into her coffee. After drinking it, Huang became confused and was eventually taken by Qiu to Room 507 of the Continental Hotel on Xizang Road. Qiu's accomplices, Ye Deyu and Zhang Shoushan, were also in the room. Seeing the situation, they helped Qiu snatch a gold bracelet and a gold watch that Huang was wearing. Afterwards, Qiu stayed there overnight and raped the woman. When she woke up in the middle of the night, the woman realized that she had been defiled and that her gold jewelry had disappeared at the same time. Overcome with shame and anger, she grabbed Qiu and cried for help. The waiter arrived, asked about the situation, and telegraphed the Xincheng Police Station, which dispatched patrol officer Wang Jichuan to take Huang to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Songtong Piloting Association Submits Application for Record Registration</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Piloting (i.e., piloting) on the Songhu and Songhan sections has been taken back and operated independently. However, the Songtong section (i.e., Wusong to Tongsha) is still piloted by foreigners, with only two Chinese participating. Because it is related to sovereignty, it has attracted much attention from the shipping industry. Recently, the Songtong Piloting Association has been organized, with its headquarters at No. 73 Zhongshan East Road, and has drafted rules and regulations to apply to the relevant authorities for registration. Once approved, it will be formally established.</p>

<h3>Li Shiqun's Concubine Attempts to Evade the Reversal of Illicit Assets. Three Monks Come Forward to Resell Them to Cao Huilin for a Price of 136 Million Yuan. The City Defense Department Summons Zhu Yuru and Mingzhen for Questioning.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 13th] There is a delicate Western-style house at No. 11 Shuanglin Lane, Zhongzheng Road, in this city, with about ten rooms. The house was given by the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Bank Director Li Wenbin to Li Shiqun's concubine. After the victory, Li's concubine, in an attempt to evade the reversal of illicit assets, transferred it to three monks, Xuanming, Mingyang, and Yishen, of the Xuanming Lecture Hall on Daxilu Road in Shanghai. Li's concubine had an illicit relationship with Xuanming, and after Xuanming obtained the house, he sent several nuns to live there to avoid attention. He also destroyed the original contract. He registered with the Land Registry using one character from each of the three monks' names and obtained the ownership certificate. Recently, Xuanming heard rumors from the outside world and was heavily criticized. He entrusted Zhu Yuru, who had served as a puppet town chief, and Zhu Jinren and Zhang Zhidao, the owners of Zhu Yonghe on Lindun Road, to sell it to Cao Huilin, a famous Shanghai actress, for 136 million yuan. Afterwards, someone reported it to the City Defense Command. Yesterday, the military law office summoned Zhu Yuru and the nun Mingzhen, who lived there, for questioning. Zhu claimed that he had not handled the sale of the house. Mingzhen said that she did not know the inside story. After the questioning, Zhu and others were released on bail. It is learned that the City Defense Department will summon the seller, Cao Huilin, to investigate the truth.</p>

<h3>Military Training Certificates to be Reissued to Students Trained in 1937</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Has Received a Telegram from the Ministry of National Defense Promulgating the Methods</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense has recently telegraphed and promulgated the methods for reissuing military training certificates to students trained in 1937 in various provinces and cities in the Nanjing-Shanghai area. The original telegram stated: "It has been found that students trained above the high school level in the Nanjing-Shanghai area in 1937 did not receive training certificates because of the outbreak of the War of Resistance and the government's relocation to the west. Recently, students have been requesting them, but due to the reorganization of military institutions and the repeated transfer of business, the records have been lost and it is difficult to verify. It is now stipulated that students who participated in training in 1937 and have not received a certificate must: (1) Provide the location, time, and names of the principal officers at all levels, and the team number and class to which they were assigned during training. (2) Provide valid proof of training (such as the training class roster, as well as the school transcript for 1937, etc.). (3) Have the principal of the original school provide responsible certification. (4) Provide two 2.5-inch bareheaded photos. (5) The participating students must prepare the above four items and register with the original school, and the school will compile three copies of the roster of trained students and submit them along with the documents to the original organizing and co-organizing agencies for verification and approval." After receiving the telegram, the Municipal Government has ordered the Education Bureau and the Civil Affairs Office to comply.</p>

<h3>Chaotic Edible Oil Market: China Trust Suspends Distribution Yesterday; New Measures to be Determined, Possibly Resuming on Monday</h3>
<p>China Trust Bureau temporarily suspended the distribution of edible oil yesterday. According to Yu Ruxin, manager of the purchasing department of the bureau, the reason for the temporary suspension is that the edible oil market has been too chaotic recently, and it is necessary to review the regulations. Therefore, the distribution has been temporarily suspended, and a thorough method will be formulated. A decision will be made as soon as Mayor Wu and President Zhang return to Shanghai. If time permits, distribution may resume as early as next Monday. The current problem is entirely due to speculative buying. (1) The price of raw materials in the producing area has risen, and the price of oil has also risen accordingly. Those who engage in individual speculation have taken the opportunity to become active. They buy 700,000 in the local area and sell it to the countryside for 900,000. Market competition raises prices. (2) Part of the floating capital is making trouble, taking the opportunity to hoard and seek profit. (3) In addition to the above two situations, there are also those who take risks and engage in smuggling, which has caused severe fluctuations in the market, and the black market price is too far from the distribution price. In terms of the actual supply and demand situation in this city, the city's demand is only over 30,000 dans per month. In addition to the distribution by the bureau, Zhongzhi Factory also distributes 600 to 700 dans per day, accounting for half. The bureau is preparing 30,000 dans this time, of which 5,400 dans are reserved for the distribution of employees, leaving 24,600 dans, which is enough to meet the market demand. Other oil factories also have oil in stock, and the discussion is not a problem. The current situation is actually man-made. Trading of warehouse receipts has now been prohibited. Delivery is limited to two days after the transaction, that is, payment on the second day of the transaction, and delivery on the third day. If it expires, the transaction will be invalid. It is still difficult to determine what the future measures will be, and whether to increase the distribution price is also up to Mayor Wu to decide. The suspension of distribution this time will definitely not affect the market price, because the daily distribution quantity of the bureau has been as high as 30,000 dans, at least over 1,000 dans.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Since the Plant Oil Refining Industry Association of the Third District temporarily suspended the sale of edible oil in the market on the 13th, oil prices have fluctuated drastically. However, Zhongzhi Oil Factory continues to maintain its regular distribution work and does not stop it as a result. It is reported that the factory has also decided to distribute oil to Group C, numbers 501 to 600, next Monday. Each retail oil store will receive one barrel of cooked vegetable oil, totaling 350 dans, at a price of 750,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>The Four Joint Offices Approves Cotton Ordering Loans After Accepting Advice</h3>
<p>The Four Joint Offices has decided on loans for ordering daily necessities for people's livelihood. No separate measures will be formulated, but rather a case-by-case approval method will be implemented, starting with edible oil and cotton. Two cases were approved at the board meeting on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>(1) China Trust Bureau ordered 30,000 dans of edible oil from the Plant Oil Refining Industry Association of the Third District, with contracts signed separately by ten factories including Zhongzhi, Dachang, and Xin. Zhongzhi accounts for one-half. Regarding the price, because the market fluctuates from time to time, it cannot be fixed in advance, and it is determined according to the market price on the payment date. After the sales contract is concluded for each batch, payment is made in three installments. Payment is made once every ten days, and delivery is made in Shanghai in three installments, once every fifteen days. Each member factory signs contracts individually and finds its own guarantor separately. However, each member factory must still bear the responsibility of joint and several guarantee. Zhongzhi is responsible for oil quality inspection.</p>
<p>(2) The Huainan Salt Reclamation Company General Administration was approved to release cotton loans of 5 billion yuan, with the loan period limited to five months and a monthly interest rate of 4%. When the loan is due, the principal and interest will be repaid at the price of lint cotton. The price of lint cotton is determined according to the market price at the time of payment, with Nantong as the delivery location for the cotton.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Trend Downward, Foreign Stocks Fall Back</h3>
<p>Public bonds were unsupported yesterday and trended downward again, with even fewer transactions, only around 4 million. Although Room 230 was accepting them, Rooms 550, 552, and retail investors were slightly accepting them. National Bond C opened at 12,400 yuan in the morning, then slightly decreased to close below 12,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, National Bond A, B, and E each fell 400 yuan. National Bond C slightly increased by 300 yuan, while National Bond D fell by 700 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fluctuated and fell back yesterday. The market was unstable in the middle of the day. Securities brokers were still buying, banks were selling, and foreign and Cantonese brokers sold immediately after entering. Ewo Yarns opened at 10,600 yuan in the morning, first falling to 10,400 yuan, then rising back to 10,7300 yuan, and then falling back to 10,300 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yieh Kwong Telephone remained flat, Paper Mill fell slightly by 10%, Ewo Brewery and Steel Industry each fell by 50%, and Ewo Yarns, British American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden each slightly declined.</p>
<h3>Discount and Loan Committee Approves 14 Cases</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The 23rd regular meeting of the Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Discount and Loan Committee of the Central Bank was held in the committee's conference room at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than ten members were present, chaired by Zhu Tongjiu. As a result of the review, fourteen industrial loan cases were approved, amounting to 4.14 billion yuan, which will be approved at this week's Discount and Loan Committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Qi Hong Tea Transactions Stagnant</h3>
<p>The Qimen black tea of this year, which was actively inspected by companies such as Wang Yutai and Huacha a few days ago, was inquired about by various parties in the market yesterday. However, buyers' bids were unusually stingy, only around 1.2 million to 2 million yuan per dan, which formed a stark contrast with the sellers' asking prices, and transactions ultimately lacked activity. The supply and demand for other varieties remained scarce, and the market situation was calm. As for domestic tea, sales by this street and by guest merchants have not stopped. Although various grades of prices are being sold one after another by retail investors, there are also many who frequently consider raising prices, so they have been able to support the market from falling, and as a result, it continues to show a fluctuating trend.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, the Anhui black tea of this year, which exporters have been longing for for a long time, is difficult to trade due to the tightening of prices. It is also learned that currently, colleagues are specially shipping 50 boxes to Wuxi for domestic sales. It is heard that they are mostly medium-grade goods, priced at 650,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>This City's Rice and Flour: Loans Should Not Be a Problem; Government Temporarily Does Not Dump and Strengthens Rice Distribution</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday: The supply of rice and flour in this city should not be a problem. Although white indica and thin japonica have fluctuated, the intermediate grade of indica rice has always maintained a price of over 300,000 yuan, so the recent rise in rice prices has not had a great impact on citizens. The government has a set policy on food, and does not intend to dump it on the market in the near future, but will strive to strengthen distribution. Dumping, although it can suppress market prices, will stimulate the producing areas and prevent goods from coming to Shanghai. Edible oil has been temporarily suspended by the China Trust Bureau because market dumping has been discovered, with corruption in between. Negotiations are underway to change the technical aspects of dumping.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Still Has Quotas</p>
<p>It is also reported: This city's rice reserves are extremely strong, that is, the foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau, more than 300,000 tons have been shipped this year. According to the person in charge of the bureau, this year's International Food Emergency Conference still has a quota of 200,000 tons, which will be purchased from the United States, Burma, Siam, and other countries before the end of this year. They are being shipped one after another recently. The Burmese rice of 6,000 tons loaded on the Hai Chen wheel will arrive in a few days. The rice transported by the bureau is handed over to the People's Food Regulation Committee for distribution to public educators and factory workers, and 300,000 dans have been allocated since July.</p>
<p>Weak Store Stomach and Cold Spleen: Japonica Rice Falls Back</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of rice and grain was still abundant, with a total of more than 13,600 piculs arriving in the two cities of the south. The store stomach and cold spleen were weak, and transactions were sluggish. Japonica rice fell back by 120,000 yuan, new japonica rice fell sharply by more than 20,000 yuan, and early thin indica rice and medium grade also fell by 120,000 yuan. New goods of indica rice arrived from all directions, and new Du indica, sheep indica, and Tuan indica also fell by 20,000 yuan. New and old guest indica followed the decline by 3,000 to 11,000 yuan. White yuan and Yin yuan were also tired by 10,000 yuan. New white yuan from Kunshan saw new goods for the first time. The weather was clear and the rice market situation has turned downward.</p>
<p>The distribution price of flour remains unchanged, and distribution continues. The market dynamics are also quite calm, and the price is stable. Bran sales to the countryside are normal and remain stable, but small packages are lively due to the union of Minfang's processing. Soybean cakes vary from each other, and prices are mixed. The guest sales of soybeans are inactive, and the oil factories are also sluggish, cutting 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, entering a fluctuating situation. Mung beans are selling well, and continue to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans have very little retail sales, and the price rises by more than 10,000 yuan. Garden peas continue to be processed in Shantou, and the price rises by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Raw kernels have little trading, and the price is unchanged.

<p>Soybean oil is trending relatively stable, and clear oil also has little fluctuation. Sesame oil has not changed, and raw oil is selling well. Transactions in this street are smooth, and the price rises by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rises sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the soap market for daily necessities, the industry's buying appetite remained strong, and the participation of outsiders in hammering and raising prices made the market even more fierce. In the end, Guben soap rose by another 19,000 yuan compared to the previous day, Huang Xiangmao rose by 12,000 yuan, Arrow Knife rose by 15,000 yuan, and Guanghua, Henry, Beef Liver, and others all rose by more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Matches: Beautiful Brand matches sold particularly well, and the price rose by 50,000 yuan. Phoenix Brand rose by 20,000 yuan, and other new brands also slightly increased.</p>

<p>Although the 39th batch of rayon was distributed as usual, the market price soared again yesterday. No. 120 Jin San Ma Guang, after opening at 28.1 million yuan, immediately rose. The upward trend was fierce, and the maximum even exceeded the 30 million yuan mark. The closing price at noon was 30 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to no shortage of people selling at high prices, the market was slightly fatigued, and the final selling price was 29.8 million yuan. No. 120 Sinclair was priced at 29 million yuan. The results were all 2 million yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Warp</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment was firm, and the asking prices at all levels were 1 million to 1.5 million yuan higher than the previous day. D-grade was asking for 34 million yuan, but because of the shortage of goods, everyone insisted, so very few transactions were made. The transaction price for medium-grade other warp was 2 million to 2.5 million yuan, and the transaction price for high-grade other warp was 3.5 million to 4 million yuan. Dry warp was particularly popular, and 28% of the 5 dans of goods had an opening price of 23.8 million yuan, and the opening price for other warp was also between 21.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>Affected by the sharp rise in raw materials, and because of fewer production days due to the strike, all parties were searching very hard, and factory prices were also raised. After opening at 13 million yuan for a real silk quilt cover yesterday, the market continued to rise. The closing price was 31.6 million to 31.7 million yuan for the current week, and 300,000 yuan for the week of Monday. Grid crepe was asking for 45,000 yuan, but there were no transactions.

<h3>Active Buying from All Parties: Both Yarn and Cloth Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation improved because guest merchants turned smooth in their buying. Many non-industry people in this street were searching for goods, and with the cool autumn weather and active sales, the market rose under the eager need of all parties. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose to 19.5 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 900,000, and Light Double Horse and 16-count Guangming each rose by 700,000. Other coarse and fine yarns all rose by 500,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market situation rose as soon as it opened, and the price of actual sales of cloth rose particularly sharply. It was also heard that there was a huge amount of floating capital active in North China, and under the shroud of various profitable buying news, the market became even more enthusiastic and the market soared. Unexpectedly, by noon, it was suddenly reported that cross-line checks could not be used on the same day, and there was also talk of the success of the Sino-US loan, and the market atmosphere suddenly became tired. By the end, Longtou fine cloth still rose by more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 537,000 yuan.

<h3>Selling Pressure Prevailed at the Close: Chinese Stocks Initially Rised, Then Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the high price of Chinese stocks was difficult to sustain. The general buying trend in the middle of the day caused small stocks such as Xinhua, Xinya, and Chenan to be shouted up to the limit, and the entire market was full of vitality and very popular. Securities broker Yang, a major player, took the opportunity to come out of the cage outside the market. In addition, foreign stocks returned slightly, and with the thought of selling, selling pressure rose immediately and crashed very quickly. Unfavorable news, such as the inability to use same-day notes and the news of the success of the Sino-US loan, were widely circulated. Hot stocks closed at low prices at the close, and cold stocks that were not commonly traded also stood at high levels. The future trend became uncertain again.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to the previous close, medium-French stock increased by slightly less than 10%, Xinhua rose to the limit and then returned, increasing by 50%. Yongsha was flat, and Xinhuo, Meiya, and Qinxing slightly declined. Yonggong, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Huafeng slightly increased. Jinglun, Matches, Rongfeng, and Zhabei were all flat. The remaining stocks showed slight increases and decreases. In terms of forward-delivery stocks, Huafeng and Xinguang slightly increased, and Yongsha, Xinhuo, Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing slightly declined.

<h3>Methods for Treating Memory Loss</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Zhengzhong: Memory loss is the result of overusing the brain or being too weak. If you want to restore it to its normal state, you must quickly find a way to diagnose and treat it. The treatment guidelines are as follows: (1) Rest: Try to reduce work that requires brainpower. (2) Go to bed early: Do not stay up late. If you have insomnia or dream a lot, you must take sedatives. (4) Take more brain-tonifying medicine, such as phosphorus preparations, arsenic preparations, etc. If you can do this, it will definitely be beneficial. Wishing you good health, Dr. Jie Junqing, September 9th</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of Restoration Commemorative Supplement: Shanghai Telecommunications in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>— Yu Bingjian</p>
<p>Before the war, the Ministry of Transportation's telecommunications organizations in Shanghai included the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the International Telecommunications Cooperative. After the August 13th all-out resistance against Japan, all Shanghai telecommunications institutions were seized by the Japanese enemy. I, Bingjian, led a small number of telecommunications personnel to remain in Shanghai to undertake secret communications work. In August 1945, when the Japanese surrendered unconditionally, I was ordered to organize the Ministry of Transportation's Jiangnan District Telecommunications Restoration Office in Shanghai, which was later reorganized into the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) District Telecommunications Receiving Committee, to rebuild Shanghai's telecommunications industry. On September 14 of the same year, we officially took over the enemy puppet's Central China Electrical Communications Company. From that day on, we have shouldered the responsibility for electrical communications between Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the country, and various parts of the country. Therefore, this day is the anniversary of the restoration of Shanghai Telecommunications. Time flies like an arrow, and today, it has been two full years.</p>
<p>In order to review the past and plan for the future, we hereby briefly describe the progress of our bureau's work over the past two years:</p>
<p>Restoration Period</p>
<p>Since our bureau took over the enemy puppet's Central China Electrical Communications Company, we had to maintain existing communications and plan for new circuits. At the same time, because of the initial victory, various public and private institutions, factories, and schools in the rear were returning to the Jinghu area. Therefore, in a very short period of time, all parts of the country urgently demanded direct communication with Shanghai. However, at that time, our bureau was extremely short of staff, and after Shanghai fell into enemy hands, the original equipment was destroyed. What we received was also incomplete and damaged. Using such a situation to meet the needs of the time was naturally stretched thin and unable to attend to everything. The only solution was to actively carry out restoration work, that is, to repair machinery and lines, add equipment, and reorganize operations, while at the same time expediting the return of skilled telegraph and telephone operators from the pre-war Shanghai Telegraph and Telephone Bureaus, and to transfer senior staff from various bureaus in the rear to Shanghai to jointly shoulder this arduous task. In addition, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment at that time, we screened the original personnel of Central China, selected the best, and employed them to supplement the shortage of manpower. After several months of planning, by May of last year, each department of our bureau had a dedicated person in charge, and the restoration work came to an end. Regarding the restoration issue, there is one more point that should be mentioned, that is, although our bureau had many former staff members return and employed many Central China employees, we still felt that there were not enough people due to the rapid development of business. Therefore, in February of last year, we restored the Shanghai Telecommunications Personnel Training Institute, recruiting and training technical telegraph operators. In a short period of more than a year, more than 400 students have graduated.</p>
<p>Initial Construction</p>
<p>After our bureau's restoration work came to an end last year, the Shanghai market became increasingly prosperous, and the need for foreign telecommunications became more urgent. Therefore, our bureau's business also rose in a straight line. By the busiest time in April of this year, the number of telegrams sent and received daily reached more than 30,000, and the number of long-distance telephone calls made and received also exceeded 10,000. The degree of busyness was not only unprecedented before the war, but even Chongqing, which was known as extremely busy during the war, had never had such a record. Under these circumstances, our bureau had to double its efforts and launched a constructive comprehensive expansion program. Therefore, since the second half of last year, every part of our bureau, whether it is the General Office, Telegraph Room, Long-Distance Station, Business Office, Transmission Station, Reception Station, Exchange, or even the Materials Storage and Transportation Room, has been working in a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>After more than a year of efforts, as of today, in terms of equipment, we have 35 various wireless transmitters, approximately 50 receivers, 18 automatic telegraph fast machines, more than 20 long-distance telephone carrier terminal machines, more than 6,000 automatic and manual city telephone numbers, and in the city and remote control lines, there are approximately 1,000 pairs of kilometers of overhead open lines and approximately 30,000 pairs of kilometers of electric core lines. Except for the city telephone, which has not been able to be greatly expanded due to the difficult source of materials, various equipment has increased by approximately three to five times compared to when it was received, and efficiency has also been repeatedly improved.</p>
<p>New Equipment</p>
<p>In addition, many new equipments have been added, such as fax machines, teletypewriters, diversity receivers, ultra-short wave wireless machines, frequency shift signaling equipment, single sideband wireless terminals for international calls, etc., all of which were not seen before the war, and are novel communication tools even abroad.</p>
<p>Currently, the communication circuits between Shanghai and various places include 48 manual and fast telegraph circuits, and 65 direct long-distance telephone circuits. In addition, there are approximately 140 other locations that can be switched for calls. In addition, on July 1 of this year, we restored the Sino-American long-distance wireless telephone.</p>
<p>New Business</p>
<p>In terms of business, the work done in the past two years has been even more burdensome than the engineering department. Especially in the recent half year, our bureau, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Transportation and the Telecommunications Administration, has completed many new measures to improve business. This has a great relationship to the future development of our bureau. The items that have been held are approximately the following:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding facilitating the public, there are: increasing branch business offices and agencies (currently there are 16), widely establishing public telephones (currently there are more than 130), and creating telegraph booths and mobile telegraph bureaus (currently there are 6 telegraph booths and 2 mobile telegraph bureaus).</p>
<p>(2) Regarding improving service, there are: establishing model business offices (currently there are 3), setting up business offices and city telephone service desks, adding long-distance inquiry desks and reporting desks, translating incoming telegrams, compiling service manuals for business personnel, improving handling procedures, and strengthening service spirit.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the implementation of new businesses, there are: opening Jinghu authentic calligraphy telegrams, opening discounted social telegrams, telephone sending and receiving telegrams, telephone notification of collection of outgoing telegrams, transmitting long-distance telephone calls on behalf, opening discounted night letter telegrams, and opening discounted nighttime telephone calls.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding increasing speed, there are: limited-time delivery of telegrams, limited-time connection of express telephone calls, increasing wireless fast machine circuits (currently there are 15), increasing carrier telephone circuits (currently there are 41), using teletypewriters (currently there are 11), using motorcycles to deliver telegrams by telegraph delivery men (currently there are 6), increasing express telephone circuits (currently there are 7), and increasing express telegram circuits (currently there are 18).</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the improvement of accuracy, there are: spot-checking telegram paper strips, inquiring door-to-door, implementing work competitions, and strictly implementing error penalties.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding publicity, there are: strengthening business inspection and inquiry, sending out test letters, adding speed labels, strengthening advertising and recording, window display, film, slides, and broadcasting.</p>
<p>Other Work</p>
<p>In addition to engineering business, other aspects, such as receiving, storing, transporting and purchasing materials on behalf of the General Administration and various bureaus, verifying and issuing import passports and re-export certificates on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation, reorganizing the city's broadcasting stations, cracking down on private radio stations, managing specially established radio stations, holding examinations for ship radio operators, reorganizing the bureau's own pre-war and received enemy puppet real estate, screening and retaining returning personnel, and cleaning up enemy puppet debts and material accounts, are all particularly heavy tasks for our bureau.</p>
<p>Work Review</p>
<p>In the past two years, although we have continuously increased equipment and improved business, and have received many encouragements and valuable criticisms from all walks of life regarding our bureau's efforts, which have made us even more excited and vigilant, the business has developed too quickly, resulting in the replenishment of equipment and manpower not being able to keep up. Therefore, various business innovations have not been able to match the established plans and be completed quickly. For example, various parties are now asking us to open up direct circuits or extend the time for communication and calls, but because we lack machines and lines and have an insufficient number of people, we cannot do it for the time being. Furthermore, we would very much like to expand the automatic machine keys used for city telephones to meet the needs of all sectors, but because they are difficult to purchase for the time being, we cannot implement them. The reason for all of the above is nothing more than economic and material constraints, which prevent us from doing everything we want to do. Because in the current environment, adding or reforming a very small piece of equipment often requires tens of millions or hundreds of millions of yuan, and the shortage of electricity funds is a well-known fact, it is naturally difficult to bear them all. In addition, the lack of materials is a common phenomenon in the post-war world. China is like this, and so are other countries. For example, cables and automatic telephone machine keys have been difficult to supply in Europe and the United States in the past two years. These are all unexpected difficulties. Furthermore, time is the most important factor in all construction, and it cannot be accomplished overnight. What we have done now is only preliminary construction and preliminary improvement. There are still many things left for us to do. We should naturally take responsibility to complete these many unfinished tasks.</p>
<p>Expansion Plan</p>
<p>Although we are now facing unfavorable times and an adverse environment, we cannot shirk our responsibilities, nor can we fail to find ways to overcome difficulties. Furthermore, in view of the development of our bureau's business over the past two years and the possibility of Shanghai becoming more prosperous in the future, in addition to improving business, enriching equipment, improving mechanical efficiency, and strengthening the service spirit of staff, we should continue to move forward in accordance with the established policy. We believe that to meet future needs, there should also be a long-term construction plan. Although there is a temporary lack of financial and material resources, it can be done in stages, or the things that can be done can be done first. In this way, over the years, there is also hope of success. Based on this principle, in February of this year, we formulated a plan to enrich internal equipment. In this plan, the main ones are: we plan to add five powerful wireless transmitters, build one new receiving and transmitting station each, increase automatic telephones by 4,000, add 20 teletypewriters, 10 typing duplicating machines, increase the equipment of the dreadnought station by more than one time, and plan to build a telecommunications repair shop. It is also estimated that after the implementation of this plan, 30 telegram circuits, 80 long-distance telephone circuits, and 4,000 more city telephones can be added, which will be more than enough to cope with the current needs and the needs in the next two years. As for the required funds, it was estimated in February of this year that approximately 20 billion yuan would be required, which is certainly not something that can be fully borne under the current situation of scarce electricity funds. However, we have already started to proceed with the possible ones with the approval of the General Administration. It is expected that one receiving station can be completed within the year, the central room machinery can be expanded to the required level, and a part of the long-distance station equipment can also be completed. If the main machinery, such as transmitting stations and automatic telephone machine keys, can be purchased in the first half of next year, and other equipment can continue to be enriched, then this plan may be fully realized by the end of next year. By then, all the current shortcomings and difficulties can be overcome, and Shanghai's telecommunications will enter a new stage. This is what we deeply expect.</p>
<p>Final Hope</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that telecommunications is one of the public utilities, and its development depends on the common prosperity, encouragement, and assistance of the society. Therefore, we earnestly hope that all sectors can continue to provide us with valuable suggestions and criticisms at any time, and tell us the paths that should be built and reformed, so that we have a compass to guide us through the maze. In this way, the development of telecommunications will be more rapid and effective, and our ultimate goal, namely the three major conditions of telecommunications, speed, accuracy, and convenience, can also be achieved as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Cultivation of Telecommunications Talents in Shanghai for 65 Years</h3>
<p>— Hua Shijian</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a technical undertaking. It is difficult to expect development without specialized talents to operate and manage it. And this specialized talent cannot be obtained without specialized schools to cultivate it. This is the origin of the establishment of the Shanghai Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel by the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The Shanghai Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel evolved from the Telegraph School, the Telegraph Training Institute, and the Telecommunications School. It was founded in the eighth year of Guangxu in the Former Qing Dynasty and has lasted for 65 years, as long as the history of the establishment of telecommunications in our country. The first school site was located in Hu Jiazhai's Hui Xiang Li (the original site is now the Grand China Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Xizang Road). Mr. Tang Bitian from Xiangshan was hired as a teacher, with a quota of 20 students. The first batch of graduates included Mr. Zeng Qingjian and other 20 people. The school's general manager was Yao Yanhong from Biling. At that time, there was no fixed graduation date. The best were promoted and assigned to telegraph bureaus to report values, and vacancies were successively examined and supplemented. After no work, it moved to the Telegraph Bureau in Zhengjia Wooden Bridge (now the southwest corner of the intersection of East Zhongzheng Road and South Fujian Road). The quota of students gradually increased, so teachers Niu Shangzhou and Zhang Zhaowei were added. Later, a surveying course was set up, and a Dane, Bo Yisheng, was hired to teach electrical measurement, repairing engines, and erecting electric wires. In the eleventh year of Guangxu, a national examination for promotion of telegraph operators was held. Afterwards, it was held once every year of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You. Those who passed the examination were promoted to classes and grades. Those with excellent grades were retained in the institute to make up surveying courses in order to further their studies. At that time, those who taught the technique of telegraphing were called telegraphing tutors. Because the number of telegraph bureaus increased, the need for materials was urgent, so an extra telegraphing tutor was added. When new students entered the school, they first received preliminary training in the extra telegraphing tutor, and then entered the formal telegraphing tutor. Zeng Qingjian, Tang Wengao, Yu Shuxiang, and Rong Yongqing successively served as teachers. In the 24th year of Guangxu, Bo Yisheng returned to China due to illness, and was succeeded by a Dane, Ge Leisheng. After Ge's death, Mr. Tang Bitian succeeded him. Since then, more bureaus have been established and more people have been employed. In the 25th year of Guangxu, another telegraphing tutor was leased in a private house in Ankangli in Ximen (now the corner of Zhaojiabang Road and Zhonghua Road in Old Ximen) to add a telegraphing tutor and a preparatory surveying tutor. In the 26th year of Guangxu, Lin, the first chairman of the National Government, came to Shanghai to participate in the examination for the sixth class promotion with the qualification of a telegraph operator from Taiwan? And stay in the institute to study surveying. In the 27th year of Guangxu, another telegraphing tutor was added next to the General Bureau. In the 28th year of Guangxu, a Telegraph High School was established at No. 59 Xinzha Road (now No. 1446). A Dane, De Liansheng, was hired as the chief instructor, and Mr. Zeng Qingjian and others served as assistant teachers, with a quota of 12 students. They graduated in two years and taught advanced telecommunications technology. In the 32nd year of Guangxu, the national telecommunications was changed to government-run. The Telegraph School in Zhengjia Wooden Bridge moved to the north end of Old Garbage Bridge with the General Bureau, and separate surveying tutors, telegraphing tutors, extra telegraphing tutors, attached reading schools, and banner schools were set up to train intermediate and junior telecommunications cadres. The above-mentioned tutors and schools were all under the jurisdiction of the Telegraph General Bureau, and later renamed the Telecommunications Administration General Bureau, which was managed by the school's general manager in the General Bureau. Yu Shuxiang, Guo Shugang, and Wang Tingshu successively served as managers. In the second year of Xuantong, the various schools were merged into one, called the Telegraph School, and moved to Avenue Edward VII (west of Chengdu Road). The subjects were listed separately, and the fees were increased into each subject, with quotas of 40, 60, and 80 students. The Examination Section Chief of the Telecommunications Administration General Bureau concurrently managed the school. Zeng Qingjian and Lu Chengzhang successively served as them. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was changed to the Telegraph School, and Mr. Zhang Xifan was the principal. In less than half a year, it was changed to the Telegraph Training Institute, and Mr. Zhang still served as the director. In the autumn of the second year, it moved to Zhijie, Wangjia Pier, Nanshi. The institute is divided into elementary class, middle class, high class, Japanese class, bookkeeping class, wireless class, fast machine class, and engineering class. The curriculum and quota are determined by the Ministry of Transportation at any time. New students should pay attention to subjects such as national language, English, mathematics, science, and geography. During their studies, tuition, food, and accommodation are all free, and the training is for one year or two years. Those who enter the middle class must work in the bureau for three years, have merit and no fault, and register with the bureau when the class starts. They can only study after passing the preliminary and re-examination. Those who graduate from the high class must graduate from the middle class and work for three years. They must pass the previous examinations and be selected to enter the school when the class starts. Graduates of the elementary class are assigned to various bureaus to work as machine operators, graduates of the middle class are appointed as business chiefs of simple bureaus, and graduates of the high class are appointed as section chiefs or business chiefs of various busy bureaus. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, a correspondence middle class was added to enable junior telegraph operators in various bureaus to receive further training in telecommunications technology in their spare time. In the 16th year, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and established the National Telecommunications Administration General Bureau in Shanghai. The practice telegraph operators in various bureaus were transferred to Shanghai in sequence for screening. Those with slightly lower grades were retained in the institute to make up lessons, which is the so-called remedial class. In the 17th year, 40 students were recruited for the middle class. The General Bureau sent Mr. Wang Yuxiang to serve as the Dean of Studies. At the end of the year, it was ordered that the Training Institute be changed to the Telecommunications School, and Wang was appointed as the principal. Mr. Yu Runsheng served as the Dean of Studies. In July of the 18th year, Mr. Yu Bingjian succeeded as the Dean of Studies. In that year, 40 people graduated from the wired middle class and 50 people graduated from the remedial class. In the 19th year, 20 people graduated from the wireless middle class and 20 people graduated from the wired middle class. On January 28th of the 21st year, the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai, and Nanshi was also affected. People moved away one after another. The 13 people in the wireless middle class and 28 people in the bookkeeping middle class who were studying at the school graduated at that time. The 42 people in the elementary class moved to the Telegraph Bureau on Simalu to continue their classes and complete their studies. The Telecommunications School temporarily ended in April of that year. Afterwards, new students continued to be recruited and trained at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. In the 26th year, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and telecommunications personnel retreated with the army. In the autumn of the 34th year, after the victory and restoration, the Telecommunications Administration General Bureau issued an order at the end of the year to continue running the Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel in Shanghai, and Mr. Yu Bingjian, the former Dean of Studies and current Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, concurrently served as the Director of the Institute. Planning and operation began, using the former enemy puppet's Central China Telecommunications College on Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei as the site. One hundred and twenty male students under the age of 22 who graduated from high school were recruited and divided into three classes: technical, grading, and telephone. Engineer Hua Shijian also served as the Director of Education. Deputy Director Sun Hongjun and Engineer Qiu Rongcai also served as the heads of the technical staff class. Director Li Tong also served as the head of the telegraph class. Engineer Zhu Fuyi also served as the head of the telephone class. Many instructors with excellent academic experience were hired to teach various courses. In the autumn of the 35th year, 30 people graduated from the telephone class and were approved to continue recruiting 100 high school graduates under the age of 20 as fast machine trainee telegraph operators. In March of this year, 15 people in the technician class, 49 people in the third-class telegraph operator class, and 98 people in the trainee telegraph operator class graduated at the same time and were assigned to work in various telegraph bureaus. In the same month, 30 third-class technicians were recruited to maintain teletypewriters, and Engineer Li Guoliang served as the head of the class. These teletypewriters were recently purchased from the United States and are the latest type of machine in electrical communications. In May of this year, 40 people were recruited for the third-class telegraph operator class and 100 people were recruited for the trainee operator class, all of whom are currently studying. There are plans to open a middle class, selecting third-class technical telegraph personnel from various bureaus to come to Shanghai for further study. The telecommunications industry after the war is no longer what it used to be, and semi-proficient generalists are difficult to meet the needs. Since the establishment of this institute, although the name has been changed many times, it has been inherited in the same line and is the main institution for training telecommunications specialists in our country, which has been the same for 65 years. According to statistics, no less than 4,000 students have graduated before and after. During the Anti-Japanese War, the vast majority of cadres at all levels in communications, construction, and management came from this institute. The mission it has assumed is so great, the time it has experienced is so long, and the talents it has produced are so many. From Chairman Lin of the National Government, Waiter Zhu Baokui of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, Minister of Communications Gao Enhong, Liang Jiaoyan, Director of the Telecommunications Administration Ju Wanpeng, Zhou Jiayi, Rong Zaiji, Xu Zhongzhe, Wu Peihuang, Tao Fengshan, and Minister Jiang Fanwu, to cadres in various bureaus across the country, their contributions to the country and society are so great that they should be able to carry forward and become a great school with substantial brilliance. According to the facts, it is not yet fully ideal. The number of school buildings is not enough for application, there are no sports venues after class, and instruments and books are also declining. At this time of national restoration and construction, we should first cultivate a large number of intermediate-level telecommunications cadres, and cultivate their pure conduct, skilled skills, and strong physique to meet modern needs.</p>
<h3>Sketch of Mobile Telegraph Bureau</h3>
<p>— Yu Anglu</p>
<p>Although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. If you want to send a telegram, please come here.</p>
<p>After a long period of preparation, experimentation and improvement, the mobile telegraph bureau finally met the citizens on the street for the first time on the morning of August 12. The mobile telegraph bureau is a large blue and white bus equipped with a wireless transceiver. There are three semi-graphic windows for receiving and sending telegrams on the right side of the bus. There is a movable writing board attached to the front end of the bus. It is a mobile telegram business office and also a loyal "street running gentleman" in the telecommunications bureau. Every morning, it departs from the general business office of the telecommunications bureau on Fuzhou Road and works tirelessly on the street. It must be dispatched regardless of wind, frost, rain, snow, severe cold or summer heat. In the morning, the transceivers in the bureau and in the bus must be tested by both parties. After the listening is satisfactory, it is released and started. In this way, the business clerk in the bureau and the business clerk on the bus have contact. Amid the "Ha" sound, Bao slowly marched towards the city street.</p>
<p>There is a little difficulty when driving: because a "fishing rod" type antenna is slanted on the roof of the bus. If it touches the uneven cables above the road, and the antenna has a large amount of current passing through it, it is not a joke if it touches it. Therefore, when driving, you have to use a rope to flatten the "fishing rod", and stand it up again after stopping at the station. When the bus stopped in front of the Great World for the first time, many people thought that the police station's patrol car had arrived, and some people said that this was a car to catch vendors, which scared the vendors to scatter. Later, I saw the words "Mobile Telegraph Bureau" and "Telecommunications" written on the bus, and then I suddenly realized. But there are also people who immediately gathered around to see what happened, and some reached out to buy stamps. After the business clerk on the bus answered and explained very kindly, many people came to "ask for information" on the second day.</p>
<p>Here, time and space seem to be reduced. Throughout the day, the mobile telegraph bureau passes through the bustling city center. Every time it arrives at a designated station, it stays for more than half an hour to allow citizens to send telegrams at their leisure. After receiving the telegram on the bus, it is immediately transmitted to the general business office on Fuzhou Road by wireless. Therefore, sending telegrams at the mobile telegraph bureau is no different from personally sending them to Fuzhou Road, and it can also save a sum of car fare and labor. This kind of mobile telegraph bureau will also be expanded to the suburbs in the future, so that every corner of Shanghai can send telegrams anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>In this bus, there are two new tricks to introduce to you. The first is that it is equipped with the latest "steel wire recorder", which can be pre-filled with various promotional programs and sent to the bus for broadcasting. The second is to broadcast the bright bell of the Jianghai Customs from the amplifier in the mobile telegraph bureau to all the citizens, so that the clock hands in all of Shanghai move neatly and uniformly.</p>
<p>The mobile telegraph bureau will surely develop and grow with the thriving telecommunications industry. If you have time, I hope you will go and see this epoch-making scientific product! The Telecommunications Bureau's street runner - Mobile Telegraph Bureau</p>
<h3>Common Sense Talk on Telegraphs (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Express telegrams are a type of telegram guaranteed to arrive within a specific time. For express telegrams traveling along the Beijing-Shanghai line, the delivery time is limited to one and a half hours. For express telegrams traveling to other locations with express telegram service, the delivery time is uniformly limited to two hours. If you receive an express telegram from Nanjing and the time of dispatch printed on the telegram form is, for example, 14:30 (i.e., 2:30 PM), but you receive the telegram after 4:00 PM, then this proves that the telegram has exceeded the time limit for express telegrams. You can then file a complaint with the telegraph office, requesting that the special express delivery fee attached to the express telegram be refunded to the sender.</p>
<p>Fast letters, of course, should be faster than ordinary letters. Therefore, urgent telegrams should also be faster than regular telegrams. If you receive an urgent telegram that is slower than a regular telegram sent from the same location, then you have sufficient reason to file a complaint with the telegraph office, requesting an investigation into the cause of the delay. The Directorate General of Telecommunications, referring to recent reports from various telegraph offices, has stipulated that urgent telegrams should arrive within four hours and regular telegrams within eight hours. The above time limits are calculated from the time the sender submits the telegram to the business office of the sending telegraph office until the receiving telegraph office delivers it to the recipient.</p>
<p>Night letters are a type of telegram with lower fees, charged at half the rate of regular telegrams. However, each telegram is charged for a minimum of twenty-five characters. Night letters are dispatched last, so they are naturally slower than regular telegrams.</p>
<p>Social telegrams are telegrams specifically for congratulatory or condolence messages. You can use pre-written phrases provided by the telegraph office, charged at half the price of regular telegrams for a minimum of twenty characters per telegram, and gift certificates can be attached. After the receiving telegraph office receives a social telegram, it will classify the nature of the telegram and transcribe it using exquisite telegram envelopes and paper in scarlet (for congratulations) or plain colors (for condolences), which is very beautiful.</p>
<p>The third item in the telegram header is the name of the sending telegraph office, used to indicate from where the telegram was sent. The name of the sending telegraph office is usually telegraphed in English. After the receiving telegraph office receives it, it translates the English into the Chinese place name and notes it on the incoming telegram. If the recipient has any questions about the name of the sending telegraph office, they can cross-reference the Chinese and English versions.</p>
<p>The number of characters recorded in the character count field refers to the total number of characters in the telegram, from the fee-paying business identifier below the telegram header to the last character. In telegrams written in foreign languages, sometimes the sender connects characters that should be separated into two or more characters into one. Although the telegraph office can transmit it as is, it must calculate the fee based on the actual number of characters contained. In addition, some combinations of letters or numbers written in the telegram text, because they have exceeded the length stipulated by the telegraph office, must be counted as two or more characters according to the regulations. In such cases, two character counts are often noted in the character count field, separated by a fraction slash. For example, 35/32 means that although the telegram only has thirty-two characters, the telegraph office is charging for thirty-five characters. When you receive a telegram and find that the words and sentences in the telegram text are difficult to interpret, you may want to carefully count the characters below the telegram header to see if it matches the number of characters recorded in the character count field in the telegram header (if there is a fraction slash, the number after the slash should be used as the standard). If they do not match, then it is likely that the telegraph office has omitted one or more characters, and you can contact the telegraph office to investigate and supplement it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Shanghai Telegraph Office General Business Office</h3>
<p>— Ding Hua</p>
<p>The rapidly advancing telecommunications industry has transformed the entire world.</p>
<p>Going east on Fuzhou Road, near the Bund, at the corner of Sichuan Road, stands a four-story building, the Shanghai Telegraph Office General Business Office. This massive organization, which controls the national telecommunications hub, should have a considerable impression in the minds of the public! Because telecommunications are an indispensable part of transportation, especially in Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the East, which requires it for communication and connection with various places in commerce and economy.</p>
<p>The telegraph flag flies deep in the white clouds - the majestic appearance of the General Business Office</p>
<h3>Overview of the Bureau's Business</h3>
<p>— Li Tong</p>
<p>C. Business Department</p>
<p>1.  Telegrams: At the beginning of the Bureau's resumption of operations, the telegram business department had only one location, the General Business Office at No. 70 Fuzhou Road. Occasionally, when market conditions changed, there was a feeling of being overcrowded. To facilitate customers and reduce congestion, twelve branch business offices were established later in the city at No. 25 Changzhi Road, No. 59 Zhongshan South Road, and within the post office branches on Fujian Road, Yuyuan Road, Sinan Road, and Jinling East Road, as well as at the North Railway Station public telephone station, the Nanshi Pudong Wusong Minhang telephone exchanges, and within the Yokohama Bridge Bureau. In addition, the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road and Linsen Middle Road, the Sichuan Travel Service on Jinling East Road, and the Xinxin Company at No. 182 Guizhou Road were entrusted to collect telegrams. Furthermore, four telegraph kiosks were set up on the platform of the North Railway Station, in the Wenmiao Road Park, on the Bund of Nanjing Road, and at the Longhua Airport. In addition to receiving telegrams, they are also equipped with public telephones and long-distance telephones to meet the occasional needs of customers. At present, it is planned to set up telegraph kiosks at the intersection of Hengshan Road and Baoqing Road, the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Taixing Road, the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, and the entrance of Zhongshan Park on Changning Road, in order to provide widespread service. Moreover, for the convenience of customers with local telephones, in addition to being able to notify the Bureau by telephone at any time to send staff to collect telegrams, they can also apply for registration with the Bureau's business section to transmit telegrams by telephone. At the same time, the Bureau's mobile telegraph service also provided telegram receiving services on mobile post office buses No. 1, 2 and 3, and one self-designed mobile telegraph service bus has been opened to circle the city. The bus is equipped with the latest ultra-short wave transceivers, which immediately transmit the received telegrams by machine to ensure speed.</p>
<p>In addition to opening up business branch offices and providing customers with as much convenience as possible, the Bureau has also actively renovated the interior, setting up a public service desk in the General Business Office, providing telegram writing services, answering inquiries, and exchanging small bills. At the same time, a line connection status board and a direct wireless circuit status board are installed to be eye-catching. The latest teletypewriters are used in various business branch offices to transmit telegrams. Recently, a large number of business staff have been added and given short-term training. In addition to telecommunications regulations, they have also been carefully instructed on how to deal with people politely, and they are assessed at any time. Now they are able to implement them effectively and give customers a good impression.</p>
<p>2.  Telephone</p>
<p>Telephone services can be divided into the following three categories:</p>
<p>A. Local Telephone: Due to the current shortage of telephone equipment, although applications for installing local telephones are pouring in, the Bureau is still unable to provide them universally. In order to remedy this shortcoming, public telephones have been installed in various key locations and in the four suburbs of the city. As of now, [one hundred and thirty-nine] public telephones have been installed, distributed throughout the city, and others are still being installed. All locations where public telephones are installed have a special public telephone sign made by the Bureau to make them easy to identify. The local call fee for public telephones is 1,000 yuan in national currency per call, except for long-distance call fees, which are subject to separate regulations. Calls that do not connect are free. If there are any instances of excessive call charges at public telephone locations with the Bureau's public telephone sign, please notify the Bureau in writing at any time so that they can be investigated.</p>
<p>B. Domestic Long-Distance Telephone: After the victory, the focus of long-distance telephone work also focused on the three points of "connection," "smoothness," and "speed." Those that are not connected should be connected, those that are connected should be smooth, and after smoothness, speed should be sought. The speed of the domestic long-distance telephone network in our country has been astonishing in the past two years. As of now, there are 187 locations that can communicate with Shanghai, including Taipei, Chongqing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Nanjing. Recently, the Bureau has printed a price list for long-distance telephone calls, which includes the use of long-distance telephones, call locations, prices, and circuit diagrams. If you need it, please ask the Bureau's business section at No. 70 Fuzhou Road or No. 1761 Sichuan North Road for it, free of charge.</p>
<p>C. International Wireless Telephone: The Bureau opened international wireless telephone services before the Anti-Japanese War, which were temporarily suspended during the war. Starting from July 1 this year, Sino-US wireless telephone services were restored first, and other places such as Manila and London are also being tested. If the test results are good, they will be opened one after another.</p>
<h3>Tales of Shanghai Telecommunications History</h3>
<p>— Sun Hongjun</p>
<p>Shanghai was known in ancient times as a coastal saline land. It belonged to the states and counties of Yang, Wu, Yue, and Chu successively. In the Song Dynasty, it was first established as a town, and then changed to a county seat, until the Ming and Qing Dynasties. In the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843 AD), after the Opium War ended, it was opened as a port for trade between China and foreign countries, and the British and French concessions were established. At that time, European and American science flourished, and transportation undertakings became increasingly developed. At that time, enlightened people of the Qing government also realized that transportation undertakings had a close relationship with a country's economy and culture. Therefore, the Tianjin-Shanghai Telegraph Bureau was established with the approval of Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Trade for the Northern Ports and Governor-General of Zhili of the Former Qing Dynasty, to lay the foundation for our country's telecommunications industry. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, Shanghai was established as a city. Since then, commerce has flourished, the population has been dense, and the use of telecommunications has become increasingly widespread.</p>
<p>Time flies. It has been more than seventy years since our country started telecommunications. There have been many changes in the meantime, and the expansion, progress, and improvement of the telecommunications industry have been countless. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Bureau's restoration, I will collect the historical traces of Shanghai telecommunications, select the most prominent ones, and briefly list the outlines in chronological order, for the world's telecommunications concerns to understand its origin and end!</p>

<h3>Introduction to Business Inspection</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junren</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a kind of public utility, or to put it bluntly, a commercial institution with a relatively large scope. However, stores specialize in selling goods to customers, while the telegraph office does not sell goods, but specializes in providing communication convenience to customers. The business policy of general stores is how to cater to the psychology of customers and make their business thrive. Our telegraph office is no exception, so in order to understand the psychology of the public and improve the business according to the opinions of the public, the authorities have established a business inspection office directly under the business office. The duties of the business inspection office are, on the one hand, to solicit and collect opinions from the public on the Bureau's business, and on the other hand, to inspect and assess the efficiency of the Bureau's staff. Before the war, the work objects of the business inspection office were relatively simple, because the Bureau's business was not as developed as it is today. The business was idle, and the work of business inspection was also simple: as long as we paid attention to the efficiency of the staff and ensured that each telegram arrived within the prescribed time, we could rest easy. Now it is not the case. The number of incoming and outgoing telegrams has increased tenfold, but the Bureau does not have many machines, and there is such a shortage of manpower, and the staff must be specially trained to be competent. It takes half a year to train the new recruits recruited from outside. The manpower graduated from the Bureau's own training institute every year cannot meet this huge demand. Due to the above two difficulties, there are inevitably occasional delays in incoming and outgoing telegrams. For this problem, we have also racked our brains to deal with and improve it in various ways, but it is difficult to have significant progress before we can obtain enough new machines and enough manpower. However, we are not discouraged. On the contrary, we believe that this difficulty can be overcome by human efforts. We can see from the statistical figures of the recent months that the business is improving day by day.</p>
<p>In this monthly increasing number of words, it is even more worth mentioning that the number of complaints from users due to dissatisfaction does not increase because of it. This shows that our efforts are becoming effective. We are even more grateful to the outside world for constantly giving us well-intentioned suggestions and assistance, so that we can gradually improve our business.</p>
<p>In order to deeply understand the opinions of general users on the Bureau, the inspection office sends out an average of more than a thousand inspection letters every month, asking users to directly send their opinions to the office, and then the office will collect the above opinions and notify the relevant departments of the Bureau to improve them. We must also be responsible for supervising their improvement to ensure that they meet the expectations of users. For example, business inspectors must often go to various business offices to assess the work of business staff and inspect the general conditions of various business offices. We saw the crowded situation at the Bureau's General Business Office on Fuzhou Road, and studied the crux of the problem. We found that one reason was that the market prices fluctuated不定, making the busyness of telegrams uncertain; the second reason was that senders failed to make full use of their nearby branch business offices. We hope that readers will use the nearby branch business offices if they want to send telegrams in the future. Its effectiveness is exactly the same as that of the General Business Office, and it can reduce the suffering of congestion for both senders and business staff.</p>
<p>Regarding the telephone part. The inspection office must go out to inspect the charging situation of public telephones in the city. We often find that the firms managing public telephones do not charge according to the prescribed prices. This is very regrettable. We should know that the purpose of the telegraph office setting up public telephones is entirely to facilitate the public, because there is a shortage of equipment after the war and it cannot meet the needs of the public as much as possible. Residential and business telephones are installed, so public telephones are installed everywhere, so that every citizen can enjoy the convenience of telephones. Therefore, we hope that firms managing public telephones will not use public telephones as a tool for their own profit, but should provide more services. This is the common wish of the telegraph office and the public.</p>
<p>In summary, the responsibility of the business inspection office is to seek contact with the outside world, so we very much welcome readers. Please provide as many opinions as possible on the areas of the Bureau's business that need improvement, so that we can get more reference and know what should be promoted and what should be reformed.</p>
<p>Inspection Office Address:</p>
<p>No. 70 Fuzhou Road</p>
<p>Telephone 17801</p>
<p>The writer took advantage of a coincidence to make a simple tour of the General Business Office of the Telegraph Bureau. What I saw is introduced below:</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the door, the spacious space, the neat layout, and the beautified decoration will first give you a good impression. The wired and wireless circuit obstruction boards are arranged on the central pillars, so you can see at a glance where the telegram is smooth and where it is blocked. Four or five sofas are quietly leaning against the wall, waiting for the sender's little rest. In the corner on the left, there is a public telephone booth, next to the public service desk. A young staff member is busy writing telegrams for people and answering inquiries from senders. There is a telephone on the table, which is probably specially prepared for customers to use at any time!</p>
<p>At this time, a kind Mr. came out from inside. He told me a lot of valuable materials and also pointed out a lot of common sense on telegrams.</p>
<p>"This is a model business office," he said, "so the equipment is relatively complete. The many charts that are revealed are specially for senders to refer to."</p>
<p>"Telegram Price List", "Sender's Notice", "Location Map of Various Business Offices in the City", "Wired and Wireless Reachable Route Map", and "Social Telegram True Telegram Format", etc., he explained to me one by one.</p>
<p>"These are many undeliverable telegrams," he pointed to the announcements plastered in the glass frame, and continued, "These telegrams are posted for collection because the address is unknown or the recipient has moved."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, what steps do you have to go through to send a telegram?" I turned the topic around.</p>
<p>The following is the conversation with that Mr.:</p>
<p>"There are seventeen windows here - regular telegrams are at windows No. 1 to No. 4 on the left hand side, urgent telegrams are at windows No. 12 to No. 15 on the right side, express telegrams are at windows No. 7 to No. 9 in the middle, other military officer telegrams are at No. 10 and No. 11, and true telegrams and social telegrams are at No. 16 and No. 17. To send a telegram, first find the appropriate window, hand the filled-in telegram to the staff inside, and after calculating the number of words and issuing a receipt, you can pay at the nearby window. When the cashier hands you the receipt stamped with the cash register date, the procedure is complete. When there are many people crowded, the senders must line up in order, so that the order can be kept in order. Recently, the crowding situation has been reduced after the establishment of business offices in various places in the city."</p>
<p>"Excuse me, what is the total number of business operations every day at the moment?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The Shanghai Bureau sends an average of 5,000 telegrams every day, with a total business volume of about 170 million. The General Business Office accounts for about 80% of this. The business situation is probably related to the market situation. When prices fluctuate, telecommunications become more frequent, and the peak has been more than 10,000 telegrams!"</p>
<p>"How long does it take for a telegram to arrive?"</p>
<p>"It depends on the road conditions on that day. Under normal circumstances, regular telegrams arrive within 8 hours, urgent telegrams arrive within 4 hours, and the fastest express telegrams arrive within only one and a half hours."</p>
<p>"But sometimes the telegrams you send are wrong. What is the reason for this?" "There are many reasons for this, including errors on the part of the Bureau and errors on the part of the sender. For example, telegrams are prone to errors when there are line obstacles. On the sender's side, sometimes the code is translated incorrectly, or the telegram is written unclearly, which can also cause errors."</p>
<p>"Oh, I saw in the newspaper that your male and female managers here have been trained, right?"</p>
<p>"That's right. The Bureau's business staff must receive at least three months of special training, and they are very familiar with business regulations, service attitude, and telecommunications common sense."</p>
<p>I focused my eyes on the faces of the male and female staff sitting at each window, all of whom were wearing uniforms, dignified and solemn, and working non-stop under tense emotions.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, I said goodbye and came back. I was impressed by the thoughtful service of the telecommunications authorities, and I was even more admiring of the progress of science. Human power has finally overcome the difficulties of the natural environment. People who are separated by the ends of the earth can communicate with each other and pass on messages. The rapidly advancing telecommunications industry has transformed the entire world.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Telecommunications Administration</h3>
<p>The world's first Chinese telephone user: The San Francisco telephone directory lists the world's first Chinese telephone user. The user's original name was Zhan Guang (transliteration). He has been renting a telephone from the San Francisco Telephone Bureau for 55 years. Mr. Zhan went to the United States to do business at the age of 16. In 1878, the San Francisco Telephone Bureau was opened, and Mr. Zhan was the first to rent a telephone. Later, telephones gradually developed, and the number of Chinese telephone users in San Francisco has increased to thousands. Mr. Zhan himself passed away in 1918, and now his two grandsons are still in the city inheriting the ancestral business.</p>
<p>Corrupt officials in the Qing Dynasty had to kneel and bow to pay their respects to senior officials whenever they saw them. The same was true for the Telegraph Bureau. Students who were sent to schools had to kowtow to the head of the school, and those who were sent to a certain bureau had to kowtow to the head of the bureau. It was ridiculous.</p>
<p>First television test: The first test of transmitting human figures on television was on April 1927. Outdoor tests were conducted in 1928, and color tests were conducted in 1929. However, it was limited to the human figure on one side.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since report personnel were transferred to the Ministry to handle affairs. The earliest ones were Zhang Daohai, who is now working at the Beiping Bureau, followed by Cheng Anheng and Chen Xizhou, both of whom were in the second year of the Republic of China. At that time, Mr. Zhang was transferred to the Foreign Report Section of the old Ministry of Communications to handle affairs, and Cheng Chen Erkan was transferred to the Business Section to handle affairs. Now only Mr. Cheng is still working in the Personnel Section of the Electric Department. Colleagues respect him as a senior, which can be said to be as magnificent as the Lingguang Hall of Lu.</p>
<h3>Television in America</h3>
<p>— Ordinary</p>
<p>Television is no longer an industry in its infancy in the United States. In the past seven months, the United States has spent US$17 million on television receivers. According to the estimate of the Victory Wireless Company, since November 1946, various companies have sold 43,000 television receivers. There are now eight companies in the United States manufacturing and selling television receivers. Their prices range from about $300 to $2,500. In the past eight months, six cities in the United States have added television equipment, and the sales in the New York City market are still the most extensive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the prediction of Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corporation, the output of television receivers in the United States this year will be 250,000 units, and in 1948, it will increase to 1.5 million units. Due to the improvement of manufacturing technology and the increase in production volume, the price of television receivers may be greatly reduced within a few months.</p>
<p>Recently, Philco Radio Corporation has produced a television receiver with a very large display screen, and its brightness is four times greater than that of ordinary televisions.</p>
<p>Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei attaches great importance to the postal and telecommunications business in Beijing and Shanghai. He has specially appointed Mr. Zhang Kewen, technical officer of the Ministry of Transportation, Fan Yutang, secretary of the Design and Assessment Committee, Min Yongchuan, engineer of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, Shen Binglu, chief inspector of the Telecommunications Administration, and Hong Sunxiang, inspector of the Postal Administration, to come to Shanghai for inspection.</p>
<p>The inspection team arrived at our bureau at 9:00 am on August 28th, and a symposium was held in the conference room of our bureau. First, Technical Officer Zhang indicated the goal of this inspection, focusing on the implementation of the work in the first half of the year, the improvement of future business, and related personnel and materials, and the status of business revenue and expenditure. Then, Secretary Fan inquired about the implementation of the work in our bureau from February to June, the improvement of business status, and the work plan for the second half of the year. Director Li of the Business Department of our bureau and other department heads gave detailed answers.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 29th, the inspection of the general office of our bureau, Hongkou Exchange, Long Distance Station, Training Institute, etc. began. In the afternoon, the inspection of the Tian Tong Road Branch of our bureau, the International Telegraph Office, the Coastal Radio Station, and the warehouses of our bureau. On August 30th, the inspection of the Fuzhou Road General Business Office, Nanshi Exchange, Pudong Exchange, and various branch business offices of our bureau. On September 1st, the inspection of the Zhenru transmitting station of the International Radio Station and the Nanxiang transmitting station of our bureau. On September 2nd, the inspection of the Liuhang receiving station of the International Radio Station.</p>
<p>The inspection team completed their official duties and left Shanghai on September 5th. (Pei)</p>
