<h3>主席官邸開座談會　魏使批評我國現勢　認癥結點在「人謀不臧」</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕蔣主席廿二日柬邀在京國府委員，各機關首長曁央行總裁張嘉璈，國府參軍長薛岳等約三十餘人，於晨十時在黃埔路官邸客廳開座談會，介紹魏德邁與衆晤面，首由主席致詞，略謂：魏特使爲中國及渠個人之好友，此番奉杜魯門總統之命來華，爲時雖僅匝月，然南北馳勞，見聞必多，盼魏氏能坦誠對我國現勢加以批評，俾爲借鑑，而知所興革。繼由青年黨府委曾琦發言，渠强調故羅斯福總統「世界和平不可分割」之遺言及「九一八」事變時美國務卿史汀生所倡之「不承認主義」，前者爲千古之至理名言，後者迄今仍極適用，深望美國牢記勿忘，堅守勿移。最後並堅定聲稱：中國目前之問題，誠屬相當棘手，然困難決非不可克復者，渠信，不久之未來，一切均將顯示足够之樂觀。至此，魏德邁應邀發言，渠以極度坦白之態度言辭，敍述完全之真實批評我國之現勢，渠談話主要論點爲：「人謀不臧」，認爲中國之一切向極可爲，然終無一事獲得預期之後果，其癥結悉在人力未盡。關於政治方面，渠認現政府於人才之羅致，效率之增進，較前已有若干進步，然此種進步之程度，顯屬不足。關於經濟方面，渠認爲中國資源豐富，財富充足，然以貨棄於地，財藏於己，致使目前經濟財政幾瀕破產。渠並舉例以證中國之財富，據渠估計，中國僑民等在美財產，當有十五億元左右。關於商務方面，渠稱：不論國內貿易或國際貿易，均應恪守平等原則，官吏在未辭去公務職位前，絕不能經營商業。渠認爲如能發掘優秀之管理人才，使台灣及東北之工廠，礦山恢復生產，足可使經濟財政難關從容渡過。關於軍事方面，渠認爲軍人待遇過低，一士兵全月之收入及其生活水準，不如一人力車夫，此點必須盡速求取改善，否則殊不易迅速完成任何使命。渠肯定指出，中共目前之實力，已遠較渠去歲四月離華時强大，然自政府方面言，最有效之對策，莫過於反求諸己，自求進步。最後，渠並稱讚蔣主席之偉大，謂蔣主席之領導及廣大民衆之擁護，乃爲中國光明前途之保證。社會賢達府委莫德惠及民社黨政委蔣勻田，於魏氏辭畢後相繼發言，莫氏尤强調東北爲中國不可分割之領土之一部，東北之主權，中國必完全爭取，此項立塲，決不放棄或有所退讓。蔣氏則稱：中國之現勢，並不過分嚴重，中國之前途仍然充滿希望。最後蔣主席對魏氏表示感謝，十二時始散。會議共開兩小時，自始至終，充滿坦白，誠懇，友情及希望之氣氛。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕美大使館公布，魏德邁將軍廿二日上午十時訪謁蔣主席於黃埔路官邸，並應國府邀約，出席國府委會之集會，十二時一刻辭返上海路司徒大使官邸，午後與其顧問等開會，處理公務，五時至七時主持使團邀請之鷄尾酒會。</p>
<h3>魏德邁舉行酒會　邀我國首長話別　明日飛東京與麥帥晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕魏德邁使團廿二日晚六時在司使官邸客廳內及草坪上舉行盛大鷄尾酒會，籍與我朝野人士及在京各國使節話別。出席政府首長張羣·于右任·曾琦·王雲五·張萬生·俞鴻鈞·吳鐵城·陳立夫·俞大維·白崇禧·谷正綱·周詒春·李敏齊·周謙冲·蔣勻田·葉公超·董顯光·名流學者于斌·吳貽芳·羅夢册·陳裕光曁各國使節及女眷等共百餘人，由魏氏及司使親任招待。魏表示此行收穫良多，對各方所予協助，敬致謝忱。至九時盡歡而散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕美總統特使魏德邁將軍，定廿四日晨離華飛東京，廿五日於東京停留一日，俾與麥帥晤商日韓有關問題，廿六日飛漢城。據使團發言人稱：一行預計留韓時間約爲十日，在韓日程及工作計劃，俟抵漢城與駐韓美當局會商後，始可確定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕魏德邁調查事實代表團，關於搜集資料，極爲成功。</p>
<p>從各種征象觀之，魏氏自美大使館及其他美官員方面，亦獲得大宗報告。渠之建議，將一直保持秘密，直至此項建議呈交與杜魯門總統以後。魏德邁對於美國所應採取之對華政策，能貢獻三項可能途徑：（一）完全「放手」政策，（二）由聯合國干涉中國內戰，（三）對各國承認之國民政府作廣汎援助。此間外交界謠傳極盛，謂魏德邁如屬相信美國援助爲對華應採取之最佳計劃，則渠將被任爲駐華大使，重來中國。中美及其他方面人士一致同意，魏氏乃一熟悉中國及其問題之一人，具有監督任何美國援助中國計劃之資格，而此項援助計劃，蓋不外有三項目的：（一）產生好政府，（二）援助中國經濟復興，（三）阻止共產主義。</p>
<h3>全國選舉經費核定六百億元</h3>
<p>津市選所昨日成立</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕全國選舉經費，前經選舉總事務所草擬槪算，預計爲九百億元，經呈送國府批核。茲悉中央業已核减爲六百億元，以補助全國各級選所，並由選舉總事務所請准先予撥發一部份，由各該選所按實際需用情形向財部直接申請撥發。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕選總二十二日宣布，自十九日起三日以來，各地選舉事務所繼續呈報成立者，有察哈爾，廣西，南京，寗夏及松江等五處，連前共三十六處。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿二日電〕津市選所廿二日成立，主委杜建時，委員爲政府代表社會局長胡夢華，國民黨徐洽，青年黨朱德武，民社黨曹有義，決定選民登記至九月五日止，廿五日至十日辦理選民公告。</p>
<h3>建國捐座談會　僉主大戶爲征課對象　地點不應遍及全國免增騷擾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕爲討論開征建國捐而舉行之擴大座談會，廿二日下午三時於此間國際聯歡社召開，出席各參政員，立法委員及京，滬兩地議長紛紛發言，僉認在此期有錢者應踴躍出錢，惟征課對象應以大官爲主，不宜征及中產以下，而有擾民現象。經兩小時熱烈發言，大體同意起征點應提高至五百億左右，並應以京，滬，昆，蓉等大都市，而不應遍及全國，以少苛擾。課稅對象亦以自然人爲主，而不征法人，至房地產應否征收，則認五百億家產之巨富當有現款繳納，故仍將估入。今日討論後，全經會將以此爲原則，另擬方案，並設法於短期內開征。</p>
<p>今日座談會，由王雲五，邵力子，吳鐵城召集，出席滬議長潘公展，京議長陳裕光，參政員伍純武，武肇煦，尹述賢及立委狄膺，陳茹玄及全經會委員俞鴻鈞，白崇禧，陳立夫，陳啓天，左舜生等約五十人，首由王雲五致詞，說明召集座談會緣起，繼由俞鴻鈞報告草擬開征建國捐方案經過，略謂：此種新捐之目的，在供有錢者出錢，以補國庫收支不足，並以平一般民衆之公憤，惟此事在技術上殊多困難，爲集思廣益計，特舉行座談會，聽取各方面意見，以免技術發生缺陷，擾及中產階級，並有得不償失現象。俞詞畢，與會者紛紛發言，多數主張欲辦財產稅，應以巨富爲對象。狄膺·薛明劍等則主張不必另立新稅。</p>
<p>伍純武首起發言，認舉辦財產捐所將發生之技術困難，並無多大問題，主要關鍵在政府是否有此誠意與決心。目前政府爲一革命之國民政府，應以革命手段爲國民謀福利，對少數巨富不應過於偏袒，政府對征糧·征兵旣未因戶口未調查清楚而不舉辦，對開征財產捐，何以反以此爲藉口，伍氏指出，政府對大戶逃避，儘有各種制止辦法，以多報少，政府可予收買，隱匿不報，可予沒收，化整爲零，可以家庭爲單位，易名更姓，亦可澈查，稅務機關饒有經騐，無錢者尚可令其出錢，對有錢者反無辦法，寗非奇事。</p>
<p>狄膺，薛明劍相繼致詞，指出與其另立新稅，不若整頓舊稅爲愈，殺鷄取蛋，當非計之所得。薛氏指出，無錫人口不滿百萬，而其所負擔之工鑛統稅竟達四億二千五百萬，平均每人納四十二萬五千元，豈不驚人。</p>
<p>參政員尹述賢認討論此問題前，須先辯明其性質，若係基於財政理由而征收，徒增騷擾，渠不贊成。若爲政治理由開征，使巨富及投機居奇發財者納稅，則表同意。渠並指出，若干國人在外生活過於奢侈，致遭物議，應予重征，若能以二百戶爲對象，每戶征十億，即已足够，不宜征及中產階級，以增滋擾。盧前提出一新名詞，主張將新捐稅用途昭告天下。至此，上海市潘議長起立代表上海市民致詞，詳陳利弊得失（見另條）。京市議長陳裕光亦代表首都發言，認征稅應自整頓舊稅着手，希望勿竭澤而漁，令經手者混水摸魚。渠主張建國捐可分期舉辦，第一期自五百億起征，以後遞减，參政員武肇煦主張用革命手段「擇肥而噬」，名稱則主用愛國捐，惟不贊成全國同時舉辦，以免騷擾，渠認在上海·昆明·成都等地辦理則可，並認華僑在外受苦，不應再征財產捐。</p>
<p>立委周一志對開征時間提出意見，主張旣名爲建國捐，應於戰事終了後開征，以爲建國之用，至起征點，周氏亦主提高至五十億或一百億，並提高稅率至百之五十或一百，最後並希望早日改革幣制，以减少各種怪現象。陳茹玄建議將名稱改爲「自由捐」，執行時以巨富爲對象，强制繳納。彭醇士發憤慨之論，認在目前情况下，旣無法向若干人開刀，要此苛嚴條例何用。</p>
<p>與會者發言畢，即由王雲五綜合各方意見，作一結論，會議至六時一刻許始散。</p>
<p>（上）主席與加拿大代表團長克里拉將軍握手，其裏面二人爲加大使夫婦，（下）蔣夫人與加大使夫人及加代表團之布克談話。（勵志社攝）</p>
<h3>大連港暫停開放　行政院聲明並非「封鎖」　外船駛靠需經我國許可</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕政院關於大連港口暫停開放之命令，廿二日發表聲明如下：（一）近日報載政院下令「封鎖」大連港口，與事實不符，命令原文乃爲「暫停開放」，而非「封鎖」。（二）在此命令發表之後，任何外國船隻擬駛靠大連港口者，必需先得中國政府之許可。（三）無論大連港口開放與否，任何外國船舶不得經營中國沿海貿易。</p>
<h3>上海各界知名人士向魏使致送備忘錄　由潘議長携京面託司使轉交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕滬市參會議長潘公展，廿二日下午三時半應邀赴美大使館，與司徒大使談話，潘氏並面遞致魏德邁之備忘錄一件，請代轉交。該備忘錄係由滬市參會議長，副議長及工·商·教育·文化各界人士共同具名者，潘氏與司使談約半小時始行辭出。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕此次魏德邁特使來華調查訪問，先後分赴各地視察，曾三度來滬，以時日迫促，均來去匆匆，致有多數知名之士未有機會與之接觸，未由陳述所見，現魏特使任務將畢，返國有期，本市文化·教育·金融·工·商各界一部分領導人士爰特自動集合，聯名致送一備忘書函於魏特使，有所表示。該備忘錄有中文本，英文本各一份，前晚由市參議會議長潘公展氏携京，昨日潘氏親訪司徒雷登大使，當將該書函遞交司使，請煩轉致魏特使，茲探錄其全文如次：</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍曁考查團諸先生公鑒：諸君遠涉重洋，蒞臨敝國，日暑奔波，轉輾一月，其周諮博訪，殷勤懇摯之情，令人回味貴我袍澤駢肩印緬戰塲之當年。同人等執業於敝國政治·經濟·文化中心之上海，或其鄰近，包括文化·教育·經濟·金融·工·商·宗教各界主要人士，對年來敝國國事之癥結，民生之疾苦，知之較切，原擬於諸君蒞滬之日，稍事陳述，並備諮詢，乃因騶從匆匆，時期有限，或則僅陪宴席，或竟未聆雅教，咫尺天涯，均以未獲傾吐衷曲爲憾，茲值諸君訪求云畢，草擬報告，即將離華之際，同人等願貢三事，敬請注意。</p>
<p>吾人今日檢討中·美邦交，必不忘貴國故大總統麥金萊閣下之功德，蓋國際間濟困扶危，終有善果，四十年中美邦交之歷久益深，即可作一有力之證明，何况大戰以來，中美兩國誼屬盟友，曾共患難，原與普通邦交不同，而視日本之與貴國其親善與否，更不可同日而語，是則敝國於瘡痍未復之今日，對貴國作緩急相助之呼籲，自爲常情所應有，而亦在貴國朝野上下預計之中。諸公經四星期之親身訪查以後，當更能諒解此項呼籲之正當與迫切，如何體察敝國實際之需要，人民之願望，作當仁不讓之決策，斯爲諸君當前之主要課題。同人等深信急公好義之貴國人民，於在華通商，傳教興學之外，必仍確保故總統麥金萊閣下之收穫，更從而光大其前徽，而爲他日兩國繼續携手，以安定遠東大局，奠立其基礎，則諸君此行乃爲不虛，此應請注意者一。</p>
<p>其次，敝國此次蒙受戰禍，爲時最久，犧牲之鉅，創痛之深，當爲世所共鑒，勝利以後，方擬稍蘇喘息，不幸國內戰亂又起，繼之則邊疆警訊頻傳，諸君親蒞東北蒙疆，諒已有所聞見，凡此種種，吾人痛加檢討，固不容諱言人謀之未臧，而蛛絲馬跡，尤不可否認國際之因素。蓋自雅爾達會議以後，國際間强權與正義，奴役與民主之爭衡，似已另有其邊際，前例旣創，則今日若干國家之動迡局面，幾爲不可避免之後果，敝國不幸親受其害。變本加厲，此乃自然之演變，而亦正確之事實。中蘇條約承雅爾達會議之餘緒，爲貴國故總統羅斯福閣下與敝國蔣主席愛好和平委屈求全這信念所寄託，敝國縱有所犧牲，亦當信守不渝，惟東九省爲中國之領土，主權之行使，絕不容許在任何形式與名義之下有所阻碍與侵害，否則中國人民抗戰之血無異白流，倘蘇聯因任何條約以外之藉口，即可故意延緩履行或違反中蘇條約，則條約之尊嚴不存，今後任何國際間條約以至對前敵國和約之簽訂，寗非多事？而國際信義之不克維繫，與此一條約實有直接或間接之關係，顯皆非貴國故總統羅斯福閣下始料所及，亡羊補牢，將何以善其後？在貴國亦有道義上之責任，而外傳不妨放棄東北，劃疆而治之荒謬建議，斷非中國人民所能忍受，此應請注意者二。（下文轉入第二版）</p>
<h3>中英當局協商防止華南走私　取締辦法不久可公布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據海關高級人員表示，中英合作取締香港方面走私之談判，共經過三個階段。最初由九龍稅務司與港府作初步洽商，繼由央行總裁張嘉璈親赴港談判，並就華南一般走私問題，成立廣泛之諒解。第三階段爲倫敦對此事特感關切，談判重心遂移至南京，現由英使館與我有關部會詳商，對於如何消滅以香港爲中心之走私，不久將有詳細辦法公布。目前所可言者，過去我國只能在香港外圍取締走私，今後則可派人至港緝私，其效力殆不可同日而語。且自外匯調整後，僑匯已有正當之出路過去因官價與黑市相去過遠，故商人不惜冒風險走私。自外匯買賣價格公布後，此間所接報告，證明華南走私情形已稍　。以全國各區論，沿海地帶亦僅有零星之走私事件，大宗之非法行動最近尚未發現。韓國歸僑船隻上，有時亦帶有一部份貨物，本欲嚴格制止，但僑委會則認爲對僑胞有相當優待，故已不再深究。又走私在法律上不屬刑事犯，即大宗走私破獲，充其量亦不過沒收其貨物，因其過於寬大，不足以收懲一儆百之效。主管機關於半年前即呈文財部，主張以「偷漏關稅懲治條例」嚴辦走私，在此條例中，走私者不論國籍，均爲刑事犯，現悉此條例已由立法院通過，但迄未轉下，故無法執行。</p>

<h3>分析開征建國捐利弊　潘議長痛切陳詞　盼當局能整飭稅收機關</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕滬參會議長潘公展，廿二日午後出席開征建國捐擴大座談會時，對開征財產捐之利弊得失曾深加分析，並代表上海市民痛切陳詞，盼能整飭稅收機關，俾勿爲經手中中飽。渠認與其自十億元起征並征及房田產，致全國騒然，不若與美人商洽後，先行征借國人在美存款，更爲公允，且能一新國人耳目。潘氏今日慷慨發言，且列舉上海種種實例爲證，潘議長發言後，俞財長及直接稅署長王撫洲咸表示，稅收人員舞弊如查有實據，定予嚴辦。潘議長亦舉事實爲例，願負舉證之責，茲誌潘氏致詞要點如後：</p>
<p>潘氏首先指出，開征財產捐關係重大，辦理良好，有助國庫收入，且足振定人心，然若處置不善，則不特無補收入，轉滋騷擾，得不償失，故在開征以前，對於調查辦法，征收對象，征收自然人外，是否再征法人等問題，咸應詳加攷慮。茲謹將最近與上海參議會及工商界人士交換意見所得，爲諸君述之。</p>
<p>第一，財產捐能否開征成功，首應視財政當局有無整飭稅收機關決心，滬市最近所舉辦之標準稽征，查賬者往往有「講斤頭」情事，商人吃虧而不敢言，目前市價，聞有高至一　一面者，此點可向財政部長報告，此種現象若不剔除，則將來開征財產捐時，政府所得者，決不致多於中飽者。</p>
<p>第二，征收工具是否具備，是否良好，亦值得考慮。滬市辦理所利得稅，賬簿爲查賬者取走後，即約定時期在冠生園「談一談」，所談果爲何事，故稅收機關必須均加整頓。至就征收對象而言，余贊成政治性之征課，蓋如此可一新國人耳目，並有重新分配財富之意義，惟征收時，應以自然人爲對象，而不應征及法人。在目前情况下，任何一公司，工廠或商號，其資產極少在十億以下者，法人說加征收，則定無倖免者。以言征收，全體房地產以不征爲宜，蓋上海房租極廣，且大部爲中間人飽入私囊，今爲諸君述一傷心故事，滬上某孀婦有大馬路三開間店面房屋一座，房地價估計當在十億以上，店舖固因地段適中而發財，然該寡婦房租收入無幾，決不足養家，乃於其房產前告地狀，痛陳慘狀，將來一旦征及房地產，十億以上者征百分之一二，請問此數千萬元財產捐渠何能負担，必不得已唯有將房屋劃下一角捐出，再就十億元起征，而諒此事絕對辦不通。目前物價增至戰前三萬倍，戰前有三萬三千三百元者，是否爲大富翁，此點值得考慮，萬望開征財產捐後，勿小魚個個進網，而大魚未能網得一個，甚至因網口不够，以致大魚無法入網。以言征大富，國人在國外存有外匯者，爲數極夥，其名單聞有人知悉，何不即席公布。政府旣缺乏外匯頭寸，欲征財產稅，何不從此征起。過去有人謂，由於外人不願宣布存款者姓名，但至今日在華美商對國人在美存款深致不滿，聞魏德邁亦曾向我政府提出此點，我何不乘此機會提出反要求。外人如肯幫忙，可先將名單公布，利我征收，若不征收，征借亦無不可，我國旣有向外人舉債之事，對國人當無不可借債之理，此而不圖，兢兢於打撈小魚，　至天下騒然，豈可謂爲公平。</p>
<p>第三，就征收機構言，根據財部所擬課征方案，申報有機關，評價有機關，督導有機關，征收又有機關，捐稅未辦，機關先設，且名目繁多，將來能收多少，尚不可知，而經費則上千上萬，各省市皆有財政廳局之設，此皆爲中央之分支機構，何不加以利用，而必欲另立新組織。財產捐係爲中央需款開征，決非爲供養機構而征。</p>
<p>第四，原方案有獎懲告密等規定，凡此更足騷擾，亦無另定必要。</p>

<h3>滬各界知名人士　致魏使備忘錄　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>復次同人等認爲中西文明傳統各異，政治素養不同，拘泥於政黨形式之任何「聯合政府」之政治體制，未必即爲應付敝國當前危機最良之方策。諸君當亦知代表敝國多歡人民之　續階層，乃爲眞正自由份子之中心勢力所在，此一階層，當非任何黨派任何職業政治家所能代表，此一階層之大衆，固曾與革命黨人合作，推翻滿淸及洪憲之帝制；固曾參加民國十五六年之國民革命，掃除軍閥及貪汚官僚，開拓敝國民主政治之先路；固曾不惜犧一切，一致奮起，以與吾美英諸國盟友駢肩作戰以獲致勝利。但諸君當亦知「君子恥言利祿」，「君子羣而不黨」，迄仍為敝國大衆信守之古訓，貴國朝野人士心目中之「中國聯合政府」，其意似爲由各黨（政黨制度已發達至相當程度之政黨）共同組織一「聯合政府」，以爲如此，即可解決一切困難；然今日敝國之政然政治，猶在培育階段，其確具遠大眼光及政網政策，足以充當重任克服難關者，殆加鳳毛麟角，因此類政黨仍大率囿於現實，徒知縱横　關，而未必各有其截然不同之政綱以資信守，若以此類政黨組織「聯合政府」，自不足即稱爲代表多數之民衆。倘諸君仍墨守西方政黨政治之常軌，忽視敝國大多數自由份子之意見與努力，誤信任何徒重形式之「聯合政府」，而不從如何可以促使政府獲致敝國大多數善良人民之擁護，則其於解決敝國之迫切問題，諸君或將猶有遺憾，此應請注意者三。</p>
<p>同人等深信諸君此行，必有成就，以中美關係之密切，則諸君返國提供事實報吿以後，必能大有助於敝國政府及人民應付當前危機與奠定復興基礎之努力；同人等深信世界繁榮與世界安全，均爲不可分割者，敝國人民今日迫切之努力。實與貴國人民對我之希望，完全相同，即：（一）安定幣値，（二）復興農村，（三）繁榮經濟及國際貿易，（四）恢復將通及地方秩序，以及（五）足以維護世界集體安全及條約神聖義務之保證。凡此一切，皆將有望於諸君及貴國政府與人民之同情與助力。同人等深知敝國復興建國之經濟政策，決趨向於符合民生主義之自由經濟制度，此不僅爲我親善之盟邦人士所期待，尤爲我全國人民歷史傳統之願望，我政府固亦曾一再鄭重聲明，竭誠歡迎國際投資，當爲中外人士所共見共聞；年來英美在華商人，或因其本身業務上偶然遭遇之困難，遂不免發生若干反感，同人等以為此種不平滑狀態之存在，自須假以時日，分別改正：第一，必須一般社會經濟現狀有所改進？則若干之管制，自可遂漸取消（此種管制實中外人士一律同感不便者），最近外匯市塲之酌量開放即其一例；第二，必須雙方各自檢討，自動糾正，敝國政府與人民當能貫澈自由經濟制度之精神。盡量淸除一切障碍，而我美英等各盟邦在華經商人士，亦須放棄百年來若干傳統觀念，正視敝國復興建國之要，本於不平等條約取消後應有之認識，以與中國工商界通商互惠。同人等深信在不久將來，敝國必能力圖革新，而有一確能代表人民意志之堅定而强有力之政府，以忠實執行此符合國家及人民需要之民生主義自由經濟政策。</p>
<p>抑尤有須爲諸君吿者：國際貿易，必須彼此貨物互市，方可永久暢通，而交受其益，若來華經營之外商，祇知在華推銷洋貨，而不從事於援助敝國增進其出口貿易之數額，則日積月累之入超，勢必因敝國之缺乏「美元」，阻塞中外通商之門戶，其受害者又豈獨敝國而已？要之，諸君任何建議，貴國政府或人民任何技術的，經濟的財政的，或精神的援助，倘不忽視前陳三事，而又能尊重中國主權爲前提，同人等深信必易獲致敝國最多數人民之歡迎與合作。臨別　陳，敬請鑒擇，順祝諸公使命成功，並請於返抵貴國之日，代同人等及上海市民，向貴國杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿，國會諸先生，暨貴國人民，敬致謝枕。</p>

<h3>黃金國有問題的再燃</h3>
<p>本月十五日，國務會議通過改訂外匯辦法，雖仍規定，取締黄金投機買賣，和禁止外幣流通。但有許多人便揣測到；這兩項投機性的物品，不久將要以新的姿態，在市塲上出現了。因爲美鈔和美匯，本是一物；黄金與外匯雖非絕對聯繫，其關係亦異常密切，自沒有長此維持現狀之理。今美鈔的兌換，旣經十二次全經會議定原則，籌議實施，則黄金問題，自然將重行解決了。</p>
<p>日來市上盛傳：黄金將國有，或說：政府將收購黄金；詳加推尋，第一種說法，恐不甚可靠，其理由如下：</p>
<p>政府何以要將黄金收歸國有？歸納起來，其原因不外三種：（一）備作幣制改革後的準備金；（二）充實外匯資金；（三）任其流於民間，於經濟財政上，恐將發生不良的後果，這自然都具有充分的理由。但要問：政府現在有沒有這筆鉅款來供收購之用？會不會加深通貨膨服的稈度，使財政經濟愈形惡化？假如發行黄金公債來充收購之用，在目前情勢之下，推行能否　利？倘使不出代價，而强迫沒收，便要侵犯私人合法的權益，那是斷乎不可能，當局亦早經表示過的。此路旣走不通，那麼，祗有照官價收買的一途。但官價定得太低，例如照目前四百八十萬一樣，事實上，便等于虛設；而定得過高，可以使一般持有人願意脫售時，又不免發生收購的資金問題。所以黄金國有這一事，在目前事實上看來，似乎可能性很少</p>
<p>其次則爲收購問題。假如强迫收購，限期竣事，其悄形與上文所述，更無二致。所以事實上所可通的，似祗有酌改官價，提高至相當合理的程度，使民衆的兌換，與政府的收購，都在自由與不定期的方式下進行，其困難或者較少。</p>
<p>有人認爲外匯旣可照市價買賣，則黄金應可自由流通，不必再加管制，這自然是最簡單易行的一法。而且銀樓業的困難，和大批死藏的黄金，都可以找到出路了，握有餘剩資金，而別無他法運用時，也可以獲得一條儲蓄的道路了。問題仍在黃金投機，是否要刺激物價這一點。按照過去金價物價互　激盪的情形，其流弊確實可怕。現在民衆要求安定生活，政府亦力求安定民生，所謂黄金市塲，應否完全開放，確乎値得顧慮。權衡利害，斟酌輕重，時機上似乎總嫌太早吧！</p>
<h3>有志青年立志從軍</h3>
<p>上海市徵集志願兵，定本月二十五日起，開始應徵登記。依國防部的兵員配額，上海市應徵現役三千名，並令限九月十五日前徵集完畢，入營訓練。上海市推行兵役尙係首次，一般人對徵集辦法及應徵手續，尙多不甚明瞭，但首次辦理兵役的成敗良窳，關係役政風氣甚大，所以我們對這次志願兵的徵集，實有深切的注意的必要。</p>
<p>依兵役法的精神，全國應實行徵兵制度，藉以樹立全民尙武奠定國防的基礎。兵役機關與地方政府，爲了權宜措施，依兵役法附則之規定，得實行志願兵制，以簡化的手續，達到兵員徵募之目的。上海市人口四百餘萬，現役及齡男子共二三·五三七名，如依法徵集三千名，本不成問題，現在改徽兵爲募兵（志願兵在兵制上應稱募兵），對於兵役法的尊嚴，理論上固無玷辱。但如志願兵徵募推行失敗，便要影響到此後的正常徵兵，及全國役政的風氣。最近以來，看上海兵役機關的努力，兵役協會的開展，民意機關的監督，其工作，其佈署、篤實踐旗，井井有條，前途似相當樂觀的。祇要有志男兒，人人爭先，人人向前，踴跚從軍，相信上海首次推行役政，自可獲得可驚的成績，而爲全國的楷模。</p>
<p>服務兵役，本爲國民應盡的天職，人人有此美務，無可假借；亦人人有此權利，無可掠奪。兵役分徵募兩制，手段雖不同，目的則一致。徵兵基於强迫，募兵基於志願；徵兵係指定中　之現役及齡男十，依法徵集入營服役，違則妨害兵役，觸犯刑章；　願兵則用號召方式，鼓勵有志靑年從戎，並不施以强迫手段，讓有志男兒，自動自覺，爭取報國良機。本年上海推行兵役，以志願兵爲主，徵兵爲輔，並於日前公佈「上海市徵集志願兵辦法，計共十一條，公佈報端。分析辦法內容，是很合乎公平原則的，至其顧慮的周詳，志願兵應徵的優待，都很有利於役政之推行。</p>
<p>現在略述徵兵志願兵辦法的內容。依規定，凡年滿二十歲至三十歲之男子，體格健全，身家淸白，從未參加共匪組織者，均可應徵。合格志願兵，一次發給安家費五萬元，並發給安家補助費四百萬元，分入營前人營時兩次發給；爲避免逃亡及詐取安家費，規定志願兵應徵，應取得確實之保證，如有逃亡情事，其損失槪由保證人負責賠償，所以志願兵與保證人，負有連帶的兵役責任。為了兵役行政的安全，連帶保證並可預防妨害兵役的犯罪情事，具有相當社會立法的意義。該項辦法的精神，實具有相當正　性。至於志願兵人　後，應否享受兵役法所列之優待權利，該項辦法並未指出，依法，志願兵服任現役，應享有兵役法所列各項優待權利。因而我們認爲，這次上海徵集志願兵，兼有徵募的優點，對於有志靑年的激奮，應有實效的收成。</p>
<p>九月十五日轉　即屆，希望上海市有志靑年，認識志願兵制的優點，立定志向，於開始兵役登記之時，人人爭先，人人向前，報名從戎，爲國家建立殊功，爲役政樹立新風氣，爲新靑年創造新生命，一洗我國靑年積　之恥。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿二日廣播：印尼共和國通訊社稱：中國政府特派專機前往巴達維亞，載送中國總領事蔣家棟至日惹，調査印尼佔領區內華僑情况。據稱，印尼共和國政府鑒於蔣氏所得情報大都歪曲事實，故特作此建議云。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿一日電〕印尼共和國總理夏利編　今夜向日尼人民廣播，囑彼等繼續向荷人奮鬥，決不受迫屈服。夏氏並佔計自八月四日停戰令生效以來，荷軍在爪哇西部已推進八十八哩，在爪哇中部推進的五十四哩，在爪哇東部推進約九十四哩，在蘇門答臘推進約三十哩。渠並駁斥范莫克總督昨夜廣播時所稱印尼共和國係受日人勢力控制之說，指荷人不予印尼人以適當之抵抗方法，遽即投降日人，並曰荷人之不能敎育印尼人，遂使日人勢力得以滲入印尼社會。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿一日電〕日惹廣播稱：范莫克總督曾向印尼共和國提出四項要求，而此四項要求並未列入范氏分發記者之英文演說稿以內。此項要求爲：（一）印尼必須停止暴力行動；（二）印尼必須停止衝突；（三）破壞及恐怖活動之命令須予撤回；（四）對於認識其本身責任因而被視爲共和國之敵者所發之恐嚇及威脅命令，務須撤回。</p>

<h3>封閉猶僑非法組織　擅設法庭損害我主權</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕旅滬猶太僑民非法組織之「仲裁法庭」，已由社會局派員會同警察局於本月十六日執行封閉。綠本市德奧籍猶太難民，數約一萬五六千人集居虹口一帶，組有「猶太衛民協會」，會址在塘山路四一二弄二二號。一九四〇年二月十八日，該會附設仲裁庭，從事調解猶人間民事科紛案件。該項「仲裁庭」之組織程序，分「四級四審」制，有裁判官評判員律師協理律師等共六人，凡猶人間任何民事糾紛經該庭第一二三審調解而當事人之一方尙未認爲滿意時，得向第四審（最高庭）請求重新判決。擔任最高庭之負責人爲猶太僑民協會主席拉斯柯斯脫。經渠本人栽判後，雙方必須履行，不得再有異議。</p>

<h3>和舶來品作艱苦奮鬥　正泰橡膠廠積極生產　從小規模開始擴展到三個工廠</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕在大部份人們沉浸在冷氣和游泳池畔排　　這惱人的溽　時，正有多少人煎熬在經常一百五十度以上的高溫裏面，爲中國的工業建設不斷地流着汗滴</p>
<p>當我們跨進了正泰橡膠廠的機房，一片動人的景象　展開在眼前：卅一座混合大機　　着逼人的熱氣，一千多個工人在週身透濕的環境下辛勤地操作，他們每天把三萬雙膠鞋，和一千多副車胎源源地供應到市面上來；使公路上，運動塲中，雨天裏，國產的橡膠製品開始能够和舶來製品展開了短兵相接的決鬥！</p>
<p>籌建新型廠屋</p>
<p>中國的橡膠事業一直是在外貨的壓制下進行着苦難的掙扎，正泰像膠廠二十年來的硏　經營，實在隱現着中國工業自求新生的一段漫長而壯烈的過程。他　從民國十六年的小規模創辦開始，現在已經進展到三個工廠同時在大量生意；從試製　式膠鞋着手，現在已能够製造　　車胎以及三角皮帶。這當中，他們　置了軍工路六十畝空地，預備興建新型廠屋；設置理化試騐室，設計創造具有最高物理性能的汽車外　；以「硫化」乾燥方法代替舊式的烘焙；用塡充劑，促進劑以及最新塗劑有效地防止破裂。於是「回力牌」的聲譽終於被確定了，這聲譽是以這麼多人的對國產工業的毅力和虔誠換來的！</p>
<p>有他內在煩悶</p>
<p>在我們參觀了該廠職工子弟學校以後，廠長袁樹森開始訴說困難了。他說單是廠裏工人的醫藥費和這學校的一切經費，就使廠方感到不勝負担，何况還有工人們的膳食費用，所以主持人的精力至少有一半以上是化在穩定經濟的工作上面。勞資問題的嚴重現在已使一般工業讓上了相同的苦痛和憂鬰，橡膠事業在這當中更有它內在的煩悶：一個月內要有四天停電，橡　原料進口列在限額之　，銷塲　　於　內，並且　日貿易又　關放了。想到將來這種已　規模的工業又要遭逢到一次決定性的打擊，我們都發出了一聲失淡的感　。</p>
<p>二千多打壯臂</p>
<p>據說現在一般工人的工作效率也較戰前低落了，這是因爲動盪的經濟環境激發他們時刻要想維持戰前的生活水準的原故。但是當我們走過車胎製　機的旁邊，看見一段段紅得像　陽　　　，經過滿流着汗液的　從　　機　　　地拉出來，灼熱的　體薰炙得地們快要窒息了，還是那　堅忍而沉着地找尋胎皮上的碎層，爲工作，爲事業，這份忠誠已經够使我們感動的了，憑什麽再去苛刻的責備他們？</p>
<p>膠鞋和軍胎的最後整理和裝盒工作都是由女工担任。從四十歲到十餘歲的女工，在不同的年齡下面默默地做着各自的分工。這二千多條粗壯的臂膊，正在塡充着中國橡膠工業過去的空虛！</p>
<p>當你轉動着汽車輪子，奔馳向淸風習習的游泳池畔時，曾否想到正有人揮抹汗滴在向那些舶來橡膠製品苦鬥着？</p>
<p>正泰橡膠</p>
<p>廠製成車胎後，女工加以整理（本報攝）</p>

<p>監察使署科長陳建業，昨日曾往行總調査，對被控各高級職員均訊問頗詳。</p>
<h3>續查行總賬冊　法院又接客密告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地檢處何惠民檢察官，昨日査閱行總有關賬册。外傳該案偵査已吿一段落，何檢察官稱，該案方開始偵査，所傳言一段落，未免言之過早。記者詢問是否將開庭傳訊各嫌疑人，何檢察官稱：俟審査賬目後，如發現其中有疑點時，嫌疑重大者將予傳訊，惟此時尙不能決定。何檢察官又稱，渠於昨日又接獲一具名「行總肅淸食汚委員會」之新密吿函，對報章業已披露之李卓敏等六人被控各項罪狀，提供若干新綫索，該函可能與原密吿面相同，出自行總內部同人之手筆，雖函未無負責人具名，無法傳詢，但該項新綫索，頗有價値，即將以此爲參考，加速進行「偵査」云。</p>
<h3>越劇學校籌基金　社局催塡計劃書</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕越劇女伶袁雪芬等爲創設越劇學校建造實驗劇塲，　募基金五十億，特假座黄金大戲院職合演出「山河戀」。昨日社會局表示該劇演出前，社會局曾囑擬具創設劇校建造劇塲之計劃書，確定基金保管辦法，及塡具募款申請書，呈核後再辦。現該項計劃書等至今尙未塡報，即於十九日起演出，對其售票所得用途，甚可懷疑。如手續再遲延不辦，則將會同警察局予以取締。</p>
<h3>南市一號碼頭　工人爭奪工作　警員彈壓幸米肇禍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市一號碼頭，及岸上一號倉庫，前係寗紹商輪公司產業，南市一至九號碼頭，自工務局收歸市有後，一號倉庫仍為寗紹公司管理。勝利後寗紹公司因無船行駛，今年起乃租與三北公司，惟三北承租後，倉庫內駐紮憲兵，無法接管，延至上月底憲兵調防，三北即於本月初接管。一號碼頭及倉庫工作工人，前在憲兵駐紥時，由達記工人工作，達記原由社會局批定准在二號碼頭工作，一三兩碼頭則歸勝記工作。勝記原係三北老工友，過去因在一號碼頭工作甚少，故亦不與計較。自一號倉庫歸三北公司接管後，勝記工人即往一號碼頭工作，但爲達記工人拒絕，雖經三北公司虞順懷出任調解，仍無效果。至達記工人在二號碼頭工作原限四十人，多則由勝記加派，今勝記爲對一號碼頭爭執，表示讓步起見，願意放棄二號碼頭，完全歸達記工作，達記工頭華達秀，亦勸導工友，勿再爭奪，工人依然不聽，乃於昨晨九時許，雙方糾衆在一號碼頭有大打出手之勢，後經邑廟分局及水上警察隊得悉，派員警到塲彈壓，始吿無事，現正由邑廟警分局與水上警察隊邀集雙方負責工友調解，　昨日傍晚尚無結果。</p>

<h3>鎭安大血案　孫濬伯餘熖未減　重上法堂</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十八日航訊〕震動全國之陜南鎭安縣大血案，該縣前縣長孫濬伯，今春先誘女敎師王　敏同居，事後，王女蓋憤中毒致死，經王父及縣參議會揭發，及後者披露外其他貪汚不法行爲，孫遂於五月二日親率縣府武力，槍殺參議長李維翰等四命於李宅內外。事後解押來省，七月中經長安地方法院判孫及其兩衛士等三人死刑。孫等不服，向陜省高等法院提出上訴，今日上午舉行首次調査庭，由刑庭長袁炳暉任審判長。旁聽者七百餘人，擁擠空前。</p>
<p>孫犯穿黄色卡嘰制服，頭髮新理，紅光滿面，昂首關步，手挾公文包入庭，其威風迄未捎减。孫稱：與李議長不協係因李　交軍糧，及李與該縣之省參議員劉南輝勾通販運鴉片，被孫發覺。彼與王女係十年老相識，王女自願結婚，且有證婚人在塲，婚後感情亦美滿。王女係因小產，非因中毒而死。李議長且　謀暴動，有事後於李宅搜出大批軍火藥彈爲證。</p>
<p>孫旋高聲揚言：「我係革命軍人，是英雄，不怕死。說死，可當堂死在這裏。我上訴，聊盡人事耳。蓋孫月前曾聲稱：「如判余有罪，余不上訴，余必當堂自殺」，故今作此語「解嘲」。孫甚且曰：「李死了，爲鎭安除一害」！</p>
<p>孫之辯護律師表示：地方法院第一審未注意搜集有利於被告之證據，而僅根據不利於被吿之片面證言以宜判，殊欠公允。對西安新聞界於事件揭發後一致抨擊孫濬伯，以致法院亦受言論壓力而不能公平下判，表示「遺憾」。——該律師作此幼稚之推論，巳引起新聞圈普遍之反感。</p>
<p>協助孫共同行兇之衛士二人過堂時，亦夭口否認當時之兇行，企圖卸脫第一審判處之死刑。</p>
<p>有一事爲庭內外旁聽旁觀人士所不了解者：彼二衛士脚鐐　鐺，而孫「縣長」並未卸帶任何刑具，坐馬車，來回於法院與監獄之間。</p>
<p>第二審是否維持原判，殊堪注目。（記者麥葉）</p>

<h3>人心虛交易稀　華股賡續疲落</h3>

<h3>改訂結匯辦法後　礦煤成本加一成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據　管會負責人語記者：自政府改訂結匯辦法後，予礦煤直接影響者，　唯：（一）窰木，（二）礦材兩種，大致將增加生產成本百分之十。目前我國所用之外煤，僅鴻基白煤一種。主要用煤，仍係賴開　，華東，淮南，台灣等礦供給。前政府向加家大訂購之烟煤三萬噸，業於週前到九千餘噸，此次政府特將煤斤列爲五種可結官價物資之一，惟相信該項官價外煤，大部均將備作安全煤之用。本市方面安全煤，現擬添增至卅萬噸，以備煤源不足時，撥充調節云云。</p>

<h3>湘米運滬</h3>
<p>招商局江陵輪，昨日首次由長沙返滬，運來食米五千五百七十七包，係長城公司採購。</p>
<h3>中港簽訂合約進行順利　港府助我取締走私　邵曾華完成使命由港返滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行業務局副局長邵曾華氏偕該行顧問羅傑士月前飛港，代表國行與港政府洽談有關金融經濟合作問題，業已圓滿結束，於本月十五日在港正式簽訂合約Memorandum　of　Agree-ment，邵氏在港公畢，並已於本月二十日返滬覆命。</p>
<p>據悉：邵氏留港期間，與港政府協議經過相當順利，港方對我甚表合作，故最後乃能完成此合約之簽訂。詳細條款，邵氏拒絕發表，據記者探悉，協定範圍，不外下列三點：（一）港方願協助我取締進出口之走私。（二）港方願協助我取締港地國幣及美金外匯黑市比率之存在。（三）港政府同意港方美金收入，（按此項收入，大部分係來自我國僑匯及出口貿易），除支付港方所需用之數額外，所有美金餘額，應祇用於中港貿易，不得作爲與第三國貿易之用。如有餘額時，該項餘額，應轉售予國行。</p>

<h3>勉護士王小姐努力服務</h3>
<p>本欄前接護士王小姐來信，謂因資格關係，往往爲同事們所輕視，現供職於某機關，又因沒有文憑，被上級機關核减底薪，一再遭受打擊，精神深感痛苦，因此詳述失學經過和努力服務的成續，希望在報上披露，期待社會人士的同情云云。原文過長，無法刋出，特簡復如下，編者註。</p>
<p>王小姐鑒，接續來書，知道您基於博愛精神獻身護士工作，在戰時救護衛國保民的戰士，在平時看護呻吟床褥的病人，您的工作極有意義，您的精神十分偉大！而您因為家境清寒，致無法完成學業，失學的痛苦，我們深表同情。所謂因無「資格」而遭歧視，在某種觀念之下，自亦無可如何。一個人能有很好的費格，又有眞實的學問，自是十分美滿的事；不過一個失學靑平，環境既不允　獲取資格，假使能够立志奮發，進修不懈，於工作中求學習，那末假以時日，也未始非磨練眞才實學的一條路徑。語云：「有志者事竟成」，您雖然因失學而沒有「資格」，實在不必悲觀，人家在竊竊地談笑，就讓他們去譏笑罷，我們誠懇地期望你　努力服務！努力學習！事事皆學問，相信刻苦目勵的結果，「定有不平凡的成就。敬祝進步！</p>
<h3>解釋「天祜垸」</h3>
<p>答復讀者張慰慈君</p>
<p>頃閱八月十三日貴報國內新聞　載有「創毁天祜垸」消息一則，並謂中央定期將其創毀，但不　「天祜垸」究係何物，請　予解　，是所至盼。讀者張慰慈啓</p>
<p>〔編者答〕所謂「天祜垸」其來歷爲湘北洞庭湖濱之農民，乘每年湖水淺落時，將一部份湖地　堤（即天祜垸）爲田，致湖面積减小，水漲時不能容　，向鄂境泛濫（因地勢關係），鄂人遂堅決要求將天祜　創毁，還田爲湖，以免受害，而湘人亦以利益所在，反對創毁，爭執已久。但中央政府爲顧全　　　　　見決定將其創毀。</p>
<p>電信問答</p>
<h3>上海電信局主答</h3>
<p>〔杭州徐平問〕「傳眞機」如何傳送眞蹟電報？</p>
<p>傳眞機係利用光電現象傳越電報，該機發訊主要設備有旋轉筒導引螺絲同期馬達光源透鏡平面鏡及光電管等。收訊方面有旋轉筒導引螺絲同期馬達及描畫針等。發訊之作用即將原來文字由面分割成綫點由光電管變成電流後，即藉無綫或有綫綫路送達對方。收訊方面即將收得之電流，經放大器再經描畫針藉同期馬達之作用，在特製收報紙上發生電暈翻出，與原來絕然相同之文字，此即傳眞機完成眞蹟電報之大槪工作情形。</p>

<h3>花朶和孩子</h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>早晨，我剛從床上爬了起來，站在門前的草地上。</p>
<p>草地的週圍生長着一些花木。有好些花正在開放着。白的，紅的，黃的，紫的……全開的，半開的，含苞的……花瓣上一律還保留着隔夜的露水，在朝陽的映照下，宛如一顆顆珍珠，閃耀着璀璨的光芒。</p>
<p>一陣微風吹過來了。花朶在枝頭搖曳，彷彿在向我點頭，彷彿在笑瞇瞇地向我說着：「早安」！</p>
<p>——早安！願妳們都好！我也不知不覺地微笑着，在心坎裏回答她們。</p>
<p>一陣急促的鈴聲響過不久，一羣孩子們也脥着新　的惺忪睡眼，從屋子裏跑出到草地上來了。</p>
<p>他們在蹦蹦跳跳，活像一頭頭剛剛出欄的小牛或是小羔羊。</p>
<p>他們忙着打踿躚，坐蹺蹺板，騎木馬……他們在笑在鬧，活像一大羣小麻雀在不斷地咶噪。</p>
<p>這當兒，我忽然異常真切地感覺到，意識到：孩子們也是一些花朶，人類的花朶呀！</p>
<p>可不是嗎？——我們大人和孩子關係，也就是花枝和花朶的關係呵！花朶裝點了花枝，延續了花枝，充實了花枝，給花枝帶來了將來，帶來了希望，……同樣地，孩子們也裝點了我們的生活，延續了我們的生命，充實了我們的生趣，給我們帶來了將來，帶來了希望……</p>
<p>而且，我們的小花朶，比她們所有的還要來得美麗，來得活潑，來得可愛哩。</p>
<p>可不是嗎！——我們的會跳會鬧，而她們的却始終默痴痴地難得動彈；我們的會說會笑，會歌唱，而她們的却永遠沉默無言……</p>
<p>當我正在站着凝想的時候，孩子們已經跑到我的身邊來，發現我的存在了；他們就馬上照例歡呼起來：「早！×伯伯早！」</p>
<p>於是，我也就把他們當中頂小的一個，名叫左左的，抱了起來，作爲他們的代表抱了起來，在他們那蘋果般紅潤圓滿的嫩頰上親了一下，然後也高聲地回答他們說：</p>
<p>「早！小朋友們，不，小花朶們早！願你們都好！都長得比那些花朶還要茁壯，美麗，芬芳！我們的明天，我們的事業，我們的一切，完全寄托在你們身上呵！」</p>
<p>（一九四七，暑中，於滬　）</p>
<h3>冷暖自知　忙裡偷閒雜話之一</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>通眉長指爪的李長吉有句曰：「不信年年遼海上，文章何處哭秋風。」只此短短十四字，已將文人寥落而甘苦自知之情，道破無遺；「秋墳鬼唱鮑家詩」雖然陰森得可怕，然長吉落拓之一生，實與屈大夫所托於「山鬼」者同出一轍，假物諷托，亦冷暖自知之一例也。</p>
<p>古今詩人落筆不求追法時尚，則冷暖自知之情境愈深且巨；六朝文運風靡，陳子昂始有「前不見古人，後不見來者……」之歎，非歎古人吾不及見，實歎「惜予好古生苦晚」也，前賢已逝，後繼無人，吾雖有心，未爲人知……此陳子昂悲凉凄蒼冷暖自知之心乎？而李青運之「大雅久不作，吾衰竟誰陳？」，杜拾遺云：「讀書破萬卷，下筆若有神。」「語不驚人死不休」，一方面足顯示前賢功力之深鉅，另一方面亦足以顯示甘苦冷暖自知之情。</p>
<p>元徵之撰杜子美墓誌銘云：「詩人以來，未有如子美者」，此一語可謂中肯至極，設杜工部非冷暖自知，則論詩六絕句斷不能寫出，「未及前賢更無疑」之句，此語固爲謙辭，然亦足窺工部集大成之所自來，而「王楊盧駱當時體，輕薄爲文哂未休；爾曹身與名俱滅，不廢江河萬古流。」自肩大　，非絕對能冷暖自知者不能道及，輕薄時文所自來處固仍沿於六朝，若詩之正流不廢，則王楊盧駱，必不能爲人傳誦千古；王楊盧駱雖被譽爲唐初四傑，然以其詩與李杜相衡，仍覺纖柔無力，杜甫非輕薄少年，以其懷李白之情，數十年不易，則可知其非難王楊輩實出自藝術欣賞之立塲也。其「文章憎命達」固爲李白鳴冤，同時亦爲甘苦自知之共鳴，尤以「不薄今人愛古人，清辭麗句必爲鄰」二句觀之，則可知所薄於王楊輩者，以其詩文仍衍六朝；所愛於古人者，以其詞氣厚重。而杜甫之愛憎固不在於「人」，實決定於「詩」，是以對李白獨厚，因其清辭麗句可愛，必求以德爲鄰也。其自知，知人之明，亦爲千古詩人獨奇，非若今之詩人，黨同伐異，言之可深感也。</p>
<p>蘇東坡詩「春江水暖鴨先知」雖曰詠鴨，實亦詠人，認定盡其所能爲過江「子弟華傾風采」者，非特以其「土厚水深詞氣重」及「但開風氣不爲師」，實緣詩格高古清奇能具哀監雄奇於一爐；水暖鴨先知，以其未離乎水也，詩之良裁劣製，詩人亦必甘苦自知，若不時懷「恐與齊梁做後塵」之心，甚而如朱湘先生所謂：「以詩爲進身之階，等到官有了，錢有了，也就不再做詩了。」（大意如此，見「中書集」），像這樣「書呈某某工部大人」之類的奇韻，「身在山林，心存魏闕」地平平仄仄胡謅一通那終歸是會身與名俱滅的。這種詩人名士，唯一的治療方法，是去讀讀鄭板橋集，才可以稍却狂悖之想。</p>
<p>孟浩然以能詠知名於世，惟對於冷暖世態苦不深知，其應對不以「八月湖水平」一詩，而以「不才明主棄，多病故人疏」，無怪落得一句「非朕棄卿，實卿棄朕」，以至終老林泉，「不才」兩句爲本身甘苦對人而發則爲牢騷。牢騷一事，愚者不能爲，智者不應爲，昔蘇東坡以洗兒詩被貶，亦「我被聰明誤一生」之例，禽以彩羽喪身，可不慎哉！</p>
<p>「鵩集於舍，主人將去」之賈誼，不能冷暖自知，强作聰明，難對於蒼生鬼神之事，卒至調乎長沙悒鬱以終。</p>
<p>是以「冷暖」之中，含有幾許「甘苦」，若自見不明徒損此道，斯時斯世，寫三兩篇文章旣無補於國計民生，又不急於蒼生涕淚，真不如焚稿葬花，夜聽秋墳鬼唱了。</p>
<h3>西山的回憶</h3>
<p>— 灃莉</p>
<p>炎熱的夏夜，一些凉風也沒有，樹葉靜靜的好像已入睡鄉，我的心中煩燥，沒有一點睡意，彷徨的思潮漸漸推遠，想起北平的西山，我生活史中第一次的避暑，也是惟一的一次，自從那次避暑回來，我開始嘗到人生的苦惱——我開始讀書，這是兒童所不能逃避的煩惱，以後隨着而來的，是我的年齡所帶給我的各種的煩惱，被二十年煩惱所刺激的我，已不堪回首過去的快樂。</p>
<p>懶懶的倚在籐椅上，默默的望着天邊，我希望能在繁星中發現一顆流星。</p>
<p>一點螢光在黑暗的樹影下飛動了，我疑心是落下的流星，牠好像是一點靈犀，照亮了我童年的回憶。</p>
<p>記得是五歲那年的夏天，外祖母和母親帶了表姐表哥和我到西山去避暑，我們在碧雲寺租了兩間房子，我們的鄰居是三位大學生，林先生是他們之中最活潑的，他最喜歡梪我玩，他的活潑和頑皮激勵了我幼小的心靈。</p>
<p>他們常帶我們騎驢，而每次都是林先生帶我，踏着沾滿露水的野花，一陣驢頸的銅鈴亂響，我們的驢一騎當先，他的同學和我的表姐表哥都落在後面，輕風吹着我的散髮，拂着他的胸膛，我禁不住轉過臉向他微笑了。</p>
<p>西山的泉水非常甘甜，林先生雙手捧了泉水給我喝，那甘泉真是旅行者的極大安慰，但是那時我纔走了多麼一點的旅程呀！</p>
<p>晚上凉風習習，碧雲寺外草叢中，一片螢光，好似今夜的繁星，我鑽在草叢捕捉夜螢，幾次想把牠合在掌中，總是還沒有接近，牠已如鬼火般輕輕的飄去，這時林先生提了一個紗囊，滿裝着夜螢，慢慢的走到我的身邊，於是我的心花如這一團螢火似的發光了。</p>
<p>但是快樂是短促的，如流星滑過天空，祗是一刹那的閃光，照耀在我生命中。</p>
<h3>Juniet之車</h3>
<p>— 盧梭</p>
<p>盧梭（Henri　Rousseau　1841-1910）是沒有受過多少教育的人。他當過兵，參加過普法戰爭，也做過稅關職員，他學畫並不從師，只是像兒童般地自我描寫。不久，居然一躍而成爲畫家。可是他始終未曾加入職業畫家之列，也少問世，直至一八八六年參加「獨立美展」之後，才爲人注目。</p>
<p>作品風格單純而樸實，天真而古拙，旣不因襲古人，又不摹擬當代，更無科學頭腦，他只依照自己眼中的幻覺描寫，成爲絕對主觀的表現。名列後期印象派四大金剛之一。</p>

<p>牆外一片空塲剛改闢爲小花園之後，我每夜便聽見有蛙聲了。於是除了狺狺的犬吠和單調的更柝聲以外，夏夜又平添了一種音樂。</p>
<p>最初的一天晚上，我不知道牠們是在那兒呌的，曾經在月光下特地去尋訪牠們，結果只聽見聲音發自一片淺草叢中，依然看不見牠們的踪跡。我立聽了好久，真有點奇怪這些扁闊的小嘴，一刻不停地閣閣不休，究竟是什麼意思：是歌唱？是對話？抑是咒罵？再不然，僅是爲了呌而呌，什麼也不是。</p>
<p>魯迅的「鴨的喜劇」一文中，曾經提到俄國的盲詩人愛羅先珂一到北京，就關心北京爲什麼沒有蛙鳴？好像不勝寂寞似的。其實我想倒不是因爲這位盲詩人對於蛙鳴有什麼特殊的愛好，而是因爲目盲，一無所見；初到北京，又正值煩熱的夏夜，在一點聲音都沒有的枯燥的生活圈子裏，就連蛙鳴似乎也不失爲一種美妙的音樂了。</p>
<p>可是如果聽慣了這種除了「閣閣閣」之外一點變化也不會的音樂，一樣地也會感到單調無味，甚至竟要以爲這種聲音簡直是多餘的，徒然地破壞了夏夜的寂寞。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　382</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>提到遁甲，許多幻想力太大的人，又會牽强附會到神秘與不可思議的法術上去了。其實，照新式說法，在陣地佈置上，不過一種「掩護」而已；有了掩護，可以蒙蔽敵人耳目，結果，我可以趨吉避兇罷了。</p>
<p>老寨的掩護方式，極其簡易；僅僅設下幾種裝置，把人引到別的小路上去，不讓走到入峽的路上來就是了。日人佔駐瀋陽後，確也有過幾次武裝探險隊，到老寨這裏來過；只是探到峽谷二三十里以外，就有一片惡林阻住，惡林邊沿，只有幾間破茅屋，住着些窮苦獵戶，認爲沒有深入價值。好在龍五爺每次游擊，都在二三百里以外，襲擊之後，主力早已走了；只賸下幾個暗崗哨綫，把敵方搜索隊，引到窮山惡林裏，讓牠們去見神見鬼；更無從想到這老塞外圍的窮苦獵戶有什麼關連。</p>
<p>老寨進出的幾條路綫，都有　派暗橋，直達瀋陽。瀋陽市上又有精密的耳目佈置；所以瀋陽的動態，老寨瞭如指掌。民國光復以來，只有一個人曉得老寨情形，那是張作霖手下特別偵緝隊的隊長，一個歸化了的義大利人，眼光學問都好，行事極合俠義路綫，龍五爺這才同他有了交道。九一八後，他辭去職務，倭方不許，却把他妻女看管起來，想利用他指引路綫，「殲滅」義民團，義勇隊，紅　子，白道會，以及各路寨子「抗日」集團等等；這種拙笨方式，那裏挾制得他住？</p>
<p>鶴見是個有心人，眼睛又亮，所以跟這人有了交道。鶴見同龍五爺發生關係，還是他介紹的哩。……然而交道自交道，龍五爺却始終沒　他們二人到過老寨。這也並非龍五爺不够交情，實因這二人的行動，太招人注意。爲了老寨的安全，也只有實行這個「絕緣」辦法，才算妥當。二人却也很能諒解。</p>
<p>後來鶴見介紹耀羣從這偵緝隊長，學習　　，卒　之後，見耀羣沒有着落，也要她實地經騐一番，便給她引見龍五爺，到老寨客居。七七之前，日人侵華日亟，耀羣覺得這等株守，偶然打打游擊，無補大局，也未能盡展所長，這才告訴龍五爺，想入關尋覓機緣，替國家幹些事業。龍五爺本來就有這個心思，所以極其贊成，並且表示將來如有適當機會，自己也願入關，爲國效忠。當下又親自跑到瀋陽，打了密電，知會老寨駐平的營業代表張金龍，好生接待耀羣，並且主張耀羣挑選幾名男女壯丁，帶在身邊使喚。</p>
<p>耀羣盤算了一回，便把龍五爺這個主張婉詞謝却：她想到自己的前進，還是一片漠糊，怎能如此舖排。且等自己有了進身再看。龍五爺也只好把這提議作罷。只叮囑耀羣，如有麻煩，張金龍手面頗廣，可以叫他幫忙。商議定了，耀羣就此準備旅行手續，單身上道。</p>
<p>誰知這天耀羣剛進車站，恁樣精細機靈的人，在人羣裏一擠，不知怎麼一來，一隻手提皮　，被人開了。臨到取錢買票，才發覺　中衣物都在，單單少了一隻錢袋。正在那裏又苦惱，又好笑的當口，只聽得身後有個孩子聲音喊着「紀姨…」費了無限心力，多少言語，才算擺脫了的小老虎，沒防着他仍奪會偷偷地追得來了。</p>
<h3>遙指銀河話「七夕」</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>「七夕」「七巧」，能引起我們許多美麗的遐想：這一個傳奇式的「節日」給予古老，優閑的中國兒女們，不少溫馨的感覺。但是到今天，誰有這心情去向銀河乞巧？誰有這餘暇對雙星渡河跪拜求福？</p>
<p>物價如刺芒，使你日夜不安；外匯市價被承認以後，捲烟業漲了三成；汽油加了一倍；私立大學每學期學費要收二百萬，公用事業又吵着要調整價格，這些，那些，使今天的兒女們，還有什麼心情去偷窺銀河「牛郎」「織女」的會晤。</p>
<p>你看，日本貨馬上傾箱倒籠往中國口岸而來，吃了八年苦，受了日本强盜長期的凌辱，那些戰前的便宜貨又擺在你底限前了，依照一般購買力說，誰都應該歡喜日本貨，因爲牠便宜而精緻；但在感情上說，這個仇恨還沒消除，牠倒又走上門來對你裝着「諂笑」，你買還是不買？</p>
<p>所說香港到了一萬五千隻日本鬧鐘，牠的響鈴，也振撼不醒中國兒女們的迷惘呵！</p>
<p>要恢復到古老的七夕銀河下求福的心情，在現在看來，多少有點諷刺意味吧。</p>
<p>也許今晚今夕，照樣也有着恭賀「七夕」的點綴，但是每一個做父母的人，他們不是在盤算着米油的上昇，就是爲着子女們的教育費在寒戰，雖然銀河依然，但那有這份心情，再向銀河雲鵲乞巧？</p>

<h3>七月令</h3>
<p>— 湘若</p>
<p>立秋前數日，細雨催凉，宛如新秋，故諺有「預先十日作秋天」之語。李福因以成詩云：「梧桐滿院綠陰連，引得新凉到枕邊，細雨斜風幾番過，預先十日作秋天。」</p>
<p>立秋日雷鳴，主稻秀不實。諺云：「秋穀碌，收秕穀」又以稻秀時，濃霧大作，中有白虹橫貫者，俗呼白　，亦主獲秕穀，謂之天收。蔡雲吳歈云：「雨洒風飄日又晴，先秋十日作秋聲，雪瓜火酒近新爽，怕聽天邊玉虎鳴。」</p>
<p>土俗，又以立秋時之朝夜占凉爙，諺云：「朝立秋，　颼颼，夜立秋，熱畔畔。」自晨以後，或有時仍酷熱不可耐者，謂之秋老虎。</p>
<p>七夕節，市上已賣巧果。或偕花果，陳香燭於庭，或露台之上，禮拜雙星，以乞巧。蔡雲吳歈云：「幾多女伴拜前庭，艷說銀河駕鹊翎，巧果堆盤卿負腹，年年乞巧靳雙星。」</p>
<p>七日前夕，以杯盛鴛鴦水，掬和露中庭，天明日出晒之，徐俟水膜生面，各拈小針，投之使浮，因視水底針影之所似，以騐智魯，謂之乞巧。吳曼雲江鄉節物詞小序，謂即右穿針還俗，枕人謂之針影。詩云：「穿線年年約比鄰，更將餘巧弑針神，離家獨見龍梭影，繼出鴛鴦不度人。」</p>
<p>七夕後看天河顯晦，卜米價之低昂，謂晦則米貴，顯則米賤，顧鐵卿詩云：「未弦月色映前漢，靜夜銀灣一望低，欲卜秋來新米價，天孫遠嫁在河西。」是時，田夫耕耘甫畢，各醵錢以賽猛將之神，舁神於塲，擊牲設醴，鼓樂以酬。謂如是則飛蝗不為災，謂之燒青苗。</p>
<p>中元，俗稱七月半。人無貧富，皆祭其先。吳自牧夢梁錄：「中元節，祀先用麻穀窠兒，寓預報秋成之意。」又云：「有力者於家設　廌悼」。是日，農家祀田神，各具粉團鷄黍瓜蔬之屬，於田間十字路口，再拜而祝，謂之齋田頭。</p>
<p>好事之徒，歛錢糾會，集僧衆，設壇禮儀誦經，攝孤判斛，施放熖口，　　　　　　　紙鏹累數　　　　　　　　鳴鑼，雜以　　　　　　　　　街頭城隅焚化，名曰　　　　繹氏要　，孟蘭，天竺語，猶云倒懸，救急器也，遂相沿作佛氏之說。又中元夜，沿河放燈，謂之照冥。吳曼雲江鄉節物詞小序云：　俗剪紙作燈如荷，編焚之，謂照幽冥之苦，但在七月晦日，不在中元。</p>
<p>二十日，俗傳棉花生日，忌雨，諺云：「雨打七月念，棉花勿上店。」</p>
<p>三十日，爲地藏王生日，婦女有脫裙之俗，裙以紅紙爲之，謂曾生產一次，脫裙一次，則他生可免產厄。昏時，比戶插香燭庭階。又有用荷花燈，燒狗　香，以作供養者。蔣元熙詩云：「金仙轉刦降東瀛，教主偏從晦日生，一點禪燈分實焰，頓教黑地盡光明。」</p>
<h3>鵲橋仙</h3>

<p>逆旅酒樓，游泳池畔；旖旎風光如縷，夜夜七夕正歡娛！歎雙星相逢有幾？</p>
<p>征衣相泣，織機中斷；洋貨充斥日千里，廠商停閉苦相思，羨他耕織話牛女！</p>

<h3>七夕雜談</h3>
<p>— 曙風</p>
<p>潯暑南過，刹那間却又將是「黃葉舞秋風」的季節了。夜間仰觀銀河，對着熌爍繁星，正興起了無垠幽情。</p>
<p>按事物紀原：「楚懷王初置七夕。」這一句話看來，可知七夕之由來已有着數千年輝煌久遠的歷史了，就是民間盛傳着的牛郎織女「鵲橋相會」的這一段神話，也早在李唐以前便普遍地流傳着了。至於有稱七夕爲「女兒節」的，倒也並不是沒有根據，因爲古時婦女處處拘於節禮，很少有機會可以痛暢自由地狂歡竟日，祗在七夕這一天，才能如此。「孔雀東南飛」中有「初七及下九，嬉戲莫相忘。」的句子，初七是指的七夕，這正說出了七夕才是古時婦女狂歡的節日。所以古人捏造出那個「天河配」的故事來。倒並不單爲着點綴而已，也有着他的因素和意義。</p>
<p>七夕雖然指的是陰曆的七月初七日這天，然而在宋以前，也有把七月初六日當作七夕的。照　　　　　　　　　　七月六日乞巧，　　　　　　　來，則當時京師人家的「乞巧」日完全是因着左廂，右廂的不同，而如以六日，七日當作七夕的。直到太平興國三年，宋太宗才下詔確定七月初七日爲七夕。詔書上說：「七夕嘉辰，著於令申，今之習俗多用六日，非舊制也，宜復用七日。」爲了「宜復用七日」朝廷方面竟然還特地下詔訂立，如此鄭重其事，可見當時把七月六日當作七夕的風氣，必很盛行，但是這種風氣未見諸唐人薄籍中，恐肇始於五代時期。</p>
<p>提起中秋節，人人便會聯想起唐明皇遊月宮那段傳奇故事來，殊不知唐明皇之與七夕的關係，才算真切。開元天寶遺事載：「明皇與貴妃，七夕宴於華清宮，列酒菓於庭，求恩於牛女星，各捉蜘蛛閉小盒中，至曉以絲網稀密爲巧候，至今士女效之。」以及長恨歌傳：「秋七月，牽牛織女相見之夕，秦人風俗，是夜張錦繡，陳飲食，樹瓜果，焚香於庭，號爲乞巧，宮掖間尤尚之。」之語，不禁暗暗爲在戎馬倥傯之際，猶有如此雅興的唐玄宗他老人家惋惜一聲。再返顧現在每逢七夕時節，除了幾個戲院子照例排演幾塲牛郎織女的天河配點綴點綴之外，就是食品商店裏一年一度供應的應時菓食了，一無其他七夕熱鬧氣象，正　出民間對於這一度佳節，已沒有從　人那種熱於乞巧的興趣了。</p>
<h3>七夕考</h3>
<p>— 虛人</p>
<p>牛郎織女雙星在七月初七的夜間，渡過天河作一年一度的相會，這個神話傳說是在漢朝時開始有的，東漢的應劭說：「織女七夕渡河，喜鵲爲橋」，這是七夕最早的記載。</p>
<p>在東漢時，七夕晚間，設酒肉　　　　　星，人守至深夜不睡，如果看見天上出現一種光暉　　　　　　　　　　　　雙星渡河</p>
<p>晉朝七夕的風俗也是設酒肉果餅，在桌上洒散香粉，向繁星祈求富貴，祈求壽齡，或者祈求賜生兒子，不過只能求一種，不可多求。</p>
<p>六朝時代，七夕除瓜果祭拜外，婦女用花線穿七孔針，針是金銀做成的，穿針的意義是求織女賜給她針黹上的巧工，如果此夜發現瓜果上有蜘蛛結的網，便認爲這是求而應許的兆頭。這種穿針，便是世上所謂「乞巧」的來源，七夕所以又稱乞巧節，即是由此而來。</p>
<p>唐朝的風流天子唐明皇對七夕極爲重視，每年的七夕之夜，必和楊貴妃在華清宮大開華宴賞樂，白居易的長恨歌說唐玄宗與楊太真「七月七日長生殿，夜半無人私語時」，確是記實之言。</p>
<p>到了宋朝，花樣更別致新奇了，宋人著的夢華錄說：「七夕，小板上敷土，種粟使生苗，置小茅屋花木，作田舍家小人物，皆村落之態，謂之穀板。於瓜上雕刻種種花樣，謂之花瓜。以油麵糖蜜造爲笑靥兒，謂之果食，花樣奇巧百端。又以茶豆小豆小麥於磁器內，以水浸之，生穿數寸，以紅藍絲束之，謂之種生。於街心張設綵模貨賣。」</p>

<p>這張「仙人球花」照片，清晰可愛，花形與一般所稱的曇花異常相似，足以證明現在所說的「曇花」確是一種仙人掌科植物，特付刊於此，以祛除關於曇花的一切神異的氣氛。按仙人掌科植物共有二十屬一千五百種，「仙人球」與一般所說的「曇花」係同科不同屬的兩種植物。仙人球是「仙人球屬」植物，曇花的屬名及種名，均尚未考定，或云宜屬於「葉仙人掌屬」，但亦未敢確定。</p>

<h3>Chairman's Residence Hosts Symposium: Envoy Wei Criticizes China's Current Situation, Believing the Key Problem Lies in "Inept Governance"</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited approximately thirty individuals, including National Government Committee members in Nanjing, heads of various agencies, Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao, and National Government Chief Military Counselor Xue Yue, to a symposium at his Huangpu Road residence at 10 AM on the 22nd. The purpose was to introduce Envoy Wedemeyer to the attendees.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang delivered an opening address, stating that Envoy Wedemeyer was a good friend of China and himself personally. Although his visit to China, mandated by President Truman, had only lasted a month, he had traveled extensively and gained considerable insights. He hoped that Wedemeyer could frankly critique China's current situation, offering valuable lessons and guidance for improvement.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zeng Qi, a National Government Committee member from the Youth Party, spoke, emphasizing the late President Roosevelt's legacy of "indivisible world peace" and Secretary of State Stimson's "non-recognition doctrine" advocated during the "September 18th Incident." He stated that the former was a timeless truth, and the latter remained highly applicable today. He earnestly hoped that the United States would remember and steadfastly uphold these principles. Finally, he firmly declared that while China's current problems were indeed quite challenging, they were not insurmountable. He believed that the near future would reveal sufficient optimism.</p>
<p>Following this, Wedemeyer was invited to speak. With extreme frankness and honesty, he presented a completely truthful critique of China's current situation. The main point of his speech was "inept governance," asserting that while everything in China had the potential to be excellent, nothing ultimately achieved the desired results. The root cause, he argued, lay in the failure to fully utilize human resources.</p>
<p>Regarding the political sphere, he acknowledged that the current government had made some progress in attracting talent and improving efficiency compared to the past, but this progress was clearly insufficient.</p>
<p>In the economic sphere, he believed that China was rich in resources and wealth, but due to the neglect of resources and the hoarding of wealth, the current economic and financial situation was on the verge of bankruptcy. He cited examples to prove China's wealth, estimating that Chinese emigrants' assets in the United States amounted to approximately 1.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Concerning commerce, he stated that whether in domestic or international trade, the principle of equality must be strictly observed. Officials should not engage in commercial activities until they have resigned from their public office positions. He believed that if outstanding management talent could be discovered and the factories and mines in Taiwan and the Northeast restored to production, the economic and financial difficulties could be overcome smoothly.</p>
<p>In the military sphere, he believed that the treatment of soldiers was too poor. A soldier's monthly income and living standards were lower than those of a rickshaw puller, a situation that must be improved as quickly as possible; otherwise, it would be difficult to accomplish any mission swiftly.</p>
<p>He affirmed that the current strength of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was far greater than when he left China last April. However, from the government's perspective, the most effective countermeasure was to reflect internally and strive for self-improvement.</p>
<p>Finally, he praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's greatness, saying that Chairman Chiang's leadership and the support of the vast majority of the people were the guarantees of China's bright future.</p>
<p>After Wedemeyer concluded his remarks, Mo Dehui, a respected member of society and a National Government Committee member, and Jiang Yuntian, a political committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, spoke in succession. Mo emphasized in particular that the Northeast was an inseparable part of China's territory and that China must fully fight for sovereignty over the Northeast, a position that would not be abandoned or compromised. Jiang stated that China's current situation was not overly serious and that China's future remained full of hope.</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Chiang expressed his gratitude to Wedemeyer, and the meeting adjourned at 12 noon. The two-hour meeting was filled with an atmosphere of frankness, sincerity, friendship, and hope from beginning to end.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The American Embassy announced that General Wedemeyer visited Chairman Chiang at his Huangpu Road residence at 10:00 AM on the 22nd and, at the invitation of the National Government, attended a meeting of the National Government Committee. He departed at 12:15 PM to return to Ambassador Stuart's residence on Shanghai Road. In the afternoon, he held meetings with his advisors to handle official business. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, he hosted a cocktail reception invited by the mission.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Hosts Cocktail Party, Bidding Farewell to Chinese Leaders, Flying to Tokyo Tomorrow to Meet with General MacArthur</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Wedemeyer mission held a grand cocktail party in the living room and on the lawn of the Ambassador's residence on the evening of the 22nd to bid farewell to Chinese officials and dignitaries, as well as foreign envoys stationed in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Government leaders Zhang Qun, Yu Youren, Zeng Qi, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Wansheng, Yu Hongjun, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Yu Dawei, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhenggang, Zhou Yichun, Li Minqi, Zhou Qianchong, Jiang Yuntian, Ye Gongchao, Dong XianGuang, renowned scholars Yu Bin, Wu Yifang, Luo Mengce, Chen Yuguang, foreign envoys and their families, totaling over a hundred people, were in attendance. Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart personally served as hosts. Wedemeyer expressed that he had gained much from this trip and extended his sincere gratitude for the assistance provided by all parties. The gathering ended happily at 9 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] U.S. Presidential Envoy General Wedemeyer is scheduled to leave China for Tokyo on the morning of the 24th. He will stay in Tokyo for one day on the 25th to meet with General MacArthur to discuss issues related to Japan and Korea. He will fly to Seoul on the 26th. According to a spokesperson for the mission, the group is expected to stay in Korea for about ten days. The itinerary and work plan in Korea will be determined after arriving in Seoul and consulting with U.S. authorities stationed in Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Wedemeyer Fact-Finding Mission has been extremely successful in gathering information.</p>
<p>Judging from various signs, Wedemeyer has also obtained a large amount of reports from the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. officials. His recommendations will remain confidential until they have been presented to President Truman. Wedemeyer can contribute three possible approaches to the U.S. policy towards China: (1) a complete "hands-off" policy, (2) intervention in the Chinese civil war by the United Nations, and (3) providing broad assistance to the internationally recognized National Government. Rumors are rife in diplomatic circles here that if Wedemeyer believes that U.S. aid is the best plan to adopt towards China, he will be appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to China and return to China. Chinese, American, and other parties unanimously agree that Wedemeyer is someone familiar with China and its problems and is qualified to supervise any U.S. aid program to China, which would have three objectives: (1) create a good government, (2) assist China's economic recovery, and (3) stop communism.</p>
<h3>National Election Budget Approved at 60 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Tianjin Election Office Established Yesterday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The national election budget was initially drafted by the General Election Office and estimated at 90 billion yuan. After being submitted to the National Government for approval, the central government has now reduced it to 60 billion yuan to subsidize election offices at all levels across the country. The General Election Office has requested and received approval to allocate a portion of the funds in advance, to be directly requested by the respective election offices from the Ministry of Finance according to their actual needs.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The General Election Office announced on the 22nd that since the 19th, election offices in various locations have continued to report their establishment. Five offices have been established in Chahar, Guangxi, Nanjing, Ningxia, and Songjiang, bringing the total to 36.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 22nd] The Tianjin Election Office was established on the 22nd. Du Jianshi is the chairman. The committee members are the government representative and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Hu Menghua, from the Kuomintang, Xu Qia, from the Youth Party, Zhu Dewu, and from the Democratic Socialist Party, Cao Youyi. It was decided that voter registration will be open until September 5th, and voter announcements will be processed from the 25th to the 10th.</p>
<h3>Symposium on National Reconstruction Donation: Consensus Favors Targeting Wealthy Households, Location Should Not Be Nationwide to Avoid Increased Disturbance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] An expanded symposium to discuss the levying of a national reconstruction donation was held at the International Social Center here at 3 PM on the 22nd. Attending People's Political Councilors, Legislative Yuan members, and the speakers of the Nanjing and Shanghai city councils spoke one after another. They unanimously agreed that the wealthy should enthusiastically contribute money during this period, but the target should be mainly high-ranking officials and should not extend to the middle class or below, to avoid disturbing the people. After two hours of lively discussion, there was general agreement that the starting point for the levy should be raised to around 50 billion, and it should be limited to major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming, and Chengdu, rather than nationwide, to minimize harassment. Tax targets should also be mainly natural persons, not legal entities. As for whether real estate should be levied, it was believed that the super-rich with 50 billion in assets should have cash to pay, so it would still be included in the assessment. After today's discussion, the National Overall Economic Council will use this as a principle to formulate another plan and find ways to start levying the donation in the short term.</p>
<p>Today's symposium was convened by Wang Yunwu, Shao Lizi, and Wu Tiecheng. Attending were Shanghai City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Nanjing City Council Speaker Chen Yuguang, People's Political Councilors Wu Chunwu, Wu Zhaoxu, and Yin Shuxian, as well as Legislative Yuan members Di Ying and Chen Ruxuan, and National Overall Economic Council members Yu Hongjun, Bai Chongxi, Chen Lifu, Chen Qitian, and Zuo Shunsheng, totaling about fifty people. Wang Yunwu first gave a speech, explaining the reasons for convening the symposium. Yu Hongjun then reported on the drafting process of the proposed national reconstruction donation plan, saying that the purpose of this new donation was to get the wealthy to contribute money to make up for the shortage of state treasury revenue and to quell the public outrage of the general public. However, this matter had many technical difficulties. To gather opinions from all sides, this symposium was held to solicit opinions from all aspects, so as to avoid technical flaws, disturb the middle class, and have counterproductive phenomena. After Yu's speech, the participants spoke one after another, with most arguing that the tax on property should target the super-rich. Di Ying, Xue Mingjian and others argued that it would be better to rectify old taxes than to create new ones.</p>
<p>Wu Chunwu was the first to speak, believing that the technical difficulties that will arise in organizing property donations were not a major issue, and the main key was whether the government has the sincerity and determination. The current government is a revolutionary national government and should seek welfare for the people through revolutionary means. The government should not be too partial to a few wealthy people. The government has not failed to organize grain collection and conscription because the population has not been clearly investigated, so why is it using this as an excuse for collecting property donations? Wu pointed out that the government has various ways to prevent wealthy households from evading taxes. If they underreport, the government can buy it up. If they hide and do not report, it can be confiscated. If they break it up into smaller amounts, they can be based on the family. Changing names can also be thoroughly investigated. Tax authorities have rich experience. Those who have no money can still be made to contribute money, but there is no way to deal with those who have money, is it not a strange thing?</p>
<p>Di Ying and Xue Mingjian spoke in succession, pointing out that it is better to rectify old taxes than to establish new taxes. It is not worth killing the chicken to get the eggs. Xue pointed out that the population of Wuxi is less than one million, and its unified tax on industrial mines has reached 425 million, an average of 425,000 yuan per person, is this not shocking?</p>
<p>People's Political Council member Yin Shuxian believed that before discussing this issue, we must first clarify its nature. If it is collected based on financial reasons, it will only increase disturbance, and he does not approve of it. If it is collected for political reasons, so that the wealthy and those who make a fortune by speculation pay taxes, then he expresses his agreement. He also pointed out that some Chinese people live too extravagantly abroad, causing controversy, and should be heavily taxed. If 200 households can be targeted, with each household levied 1 billion, that would be enough, and it should not be levied on the middle class to increase trouble. Lu Qian proposed a new term, advocating that the use of the new donation tax should be announced to the world. At this point, Shanghai City Speaker Pan rose and gave a speech on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, detailing the pros and cons (see separate article). Nanjing City Council Speaker Chen Yuguang also spoke on behalf of the capital, believing that taxation should start with rectifying old taxes, and hoped that it would not be a case of draining the pond to get all the fish, allowing those in charge to muddy the waters. He advocated that the national reconstruction donation can be held in stages, with the first phase starting at 50 billion and decreasing thereafter. People's Political Council member Wu Zhaoxu advocated using revolutionary means to "choose the fat and bite," and the name should be patriotic donation. However, he did not approve of holding it nationwide at the same time to avoid disturbing the people. He believed that it can be handled in Shanghai, Kunming, Chengdu and other places, and that overseas Chinese are suffering abroad and should not be levied on property donations again.</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan member Zhou Yizhi raised an opinion on the time of collection, arguing that since it is named the National Reconstruction Donation, it should be collected after the end of the war for the purpose of national reconstruction. As for the starting point for the levy, Zhou also advocated raising it to 5 billion or 10 billion, and raising the tax rate to 50% or 100%. Finally, he also hoped that the currency system would be reformed as soon as possible to reduce various strange phenomena. Chen Ruxuan suggested changing the name to "Freedom Donation," and when implementing it, the target should be the super-rich, who should be forced to pay. Peng Chunshi made a passionate argument, believing that in the current situation, since there is no way to operate on certain people, what is the use of this harsh ordinance?</p>

<h3>Dalian Port Temporarily Closed: Executive Yuan States It Is Not a "Blockade": Foreign Ships Must Obtain Chinese Permission to Dock</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Executive Yuan issued the following statement on the order to temporarily close Dalian Port on the 22nd: (1) Recent reports stating that the Executive Yuan had ordered the "blockade" of Dalian Port do not correspond to the facts. The original wording of the order was "temporarily closed," not "blockaded." (2) After this order is issued, any foreign ships intending to dock at Dalian Port must first obtain the permission of the Chinese government. (3) Regardless of whether Dalian Port is open or not, no foreign ships may engage in coastal trade in China.</p>
<h3>Prominent Figures from All Walks of Life in Shanghai Send Memorandum to Envoy Wei, Delivered to the Envoy in Person in Nanjing by Speaker Pan for Forwarding</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan was invited to the U.S. Embassy at 3:30 PM on the 22nd to speak with Ambassador Stuart. Pan personally delivered a memorandum to Wei De Meyer, requesting him to forward it. The memorandum was jointly signed by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council and people from industry, commerce, education, and cultural circles. Pan left the embassy about half an hour after speaking with the Ambassador.</p>
<p>[Local News] During Envoy Wei De Meyer's visit to China to conduct an investigation, he visited various places and came to Shanghai three times. Due to the urgency of the schedule, he came and went in a hurry, so most prominent figures did not have the opportunity to contact him or state their views. Now that Envoy Wei De Meyer's mission is about to be completed and he is about to return home, some leading figures from the cultural, educational, financial, industrial, and commercial circles of this city have specially gathered on their own initiative and jointly sent a memorandum to Envoy Wei De Meyer to express their views. There is a Chinese version and an English version of the memorandum. The night before, Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan took it to Nanjing. Yesterday, Pan personally visited Ambassador Stuart Leighton, when he delivered the letter to the Ambassador, requesting him to forward it to Envoy Wei De Meyer. The full text is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>To General Wei De Meyer and Members of the Investigation Group:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have traveled across the ocean to visit our country. In the summer heat, you have been working tirelessly, travelling for a month. Your thorough consultations and sincere feelings are reminiscent of the days when our comrades-in-arms fought side by side in the battlefields of India and Burma. We, who work in or near Shanghai, the political, economic, and cultural center of our country, including major figures from the cultural, educational, economic, financial, industrial, commercial, and religious sectors, are more aware of the crux of our country's affairs and the suffering of our people in recent years. We originally planned to make a statement when you visited Shanghai, and to provide consultations. However, due to the hurried schedule and limited time, some of us only attended banquets, while others did not even receive your instructions. We all regret not having the opportunity to express our innermost feelings. Now, as you have completed your visit and are about to draft a report and leave China, we would like to offer three suggestions for your attention.</p>
<p>When we review Sino-American relations today, we must not forget the merits of your late President McKinley. International assistance to those in need will eventually bear good fruit. The increasingly deep Sino-American relations over the past forty years can serve as a powerful proof. Moreover, since the war, China and the United States have been allies and have shared common hardships, which is different from ordinary diplomatic relations. Furthermore, the degree of friendship between Japan and your country cannot be compared. Therefore, it is natural for our country to appeal to your country for assistance in times of urgency and distress, and it is also within the expectations of your country's government and people. After your four weeks of personal visits, you will be able to understand the legitimacy and urgency of this appeal. How to understand our country's actual needs and the wishes of the people, and make a decision that is incumbent upon you, is the main task before you. We firmly believe that the public-spirited American people will continue to ensure the gains of your late President McKinley, in addition to engaging in commerce, missionary work, and education in China, and further promote its former glory, and lay the foundation for the two countries to continue to work together to stabilize the situation in the Far East. Then your trip will be worthwhile. This is the first point to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Secondly, our country has suffered the longest war, made the greatest sacrifices, and suffered the deepest trauma, as the world knows. After the victory, we were just about to take a breath, but unfortunately, domestic wars broke out again, followed by frequent border alerts. You have personally visited Northeast and Mongolia, and I believe you have heard and seen something. We have thoroughly reviewed all of this, and we cannot deny the shortcomings of human governance, but the international factors cannot be denied either. Since the Yalta Conference, the international struggle between power and justice, slavery and democracy, seems to have its own boundaries. Since the precedent has been set, the dynamic situation in some countries today is almost an inevitable consequence, and our country has unfortunately suffered its consequences. Intensifying the situation is a natural evolution and also an accurate fact. The Sino-Soviet Treaty carries on the legacy of the Yalta Conference and is entrusted to the peaceful and compromising beliefs of your late President Roosevelt and our Chairman Chiang. Even if our country has made some sacrifices, we should abide by it unswervingly. However, the Nine Eastern Provinces are the territory of China, and the exercise of sovereignty should not be hindered or infringed upon in any form or in name. Otherwise, the blood of the Chinese people's resistance will be shed in vain. If the Soviet Union can deliberately delay or violate the Sino-Soviet Treaty due to any excuse other than the treaty, then the dignity of the treaty will not exist, and will future international treaties, including the signing of peace treaties with former enemies, not cause more trouble? And the inability to maintain international credibility is directly or indirectly related to this treaty. Obviously, this was not what your late President Roosevelt expected. What is the remedy for a lost cause? Your country also has a moral responsibility, and the absurd proposal that is circulating outside that China should give up the Northeast and divide the border for governance is definitely not something the Chinese people can tolerate. This is the second point to pay attention to. (The following text continues on page 2)</p>
<h3>Chinese and British Authorities Negotiate to Prevent Smuggling in South China: Measures to Crack Down to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to senior customs officials, negotiations between China and the United Kingdom to crack down on smuggling from Hong Kong have gone through three stages. Initially, the Kowloon Customs Commissioner and the Hong Kong government conducted preliminary consultations. Subsequently, Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao personally went to Hong Kong for negotiations and reached a broad understanding on the general issue of smuggling in South China. In the third stage, London became particularly concerned about this matter, and the focus of the negotiations shifted to Nanjing. The British Embassy is now discussing the details with relevant Chinese ministries. Detailed measures on how to eliminate smuggling centered on Hong Kong will be announced soon. What can be said at present is that in the past, our country could only crack down on smuggling around Hong Kong, but in the future, we can send people to Hong Kong to combat smuggling, and its effectiveness will be incomparable. Moreover, since the foreign exchange adjustment, overseas remittances have had a legitimate outlet. In the past, because the official price and the black market were too far apart, merchants did not hesitate to take risks to smuggle. Since the announcement of foreign exchange trading prices, reports received here have proven that the smuggling situation in South China has eased slightly. As far as the various regions of the country are concerned, there are only sporadic smuggling incidents in the coastal areas, and no large-scale illegal activities have been discovered recently. Sometimes, ships carrying returning overseas Chinese from Korea also carry some goods. It was originally intended to strictly prevent this, but the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that overseas Chinese should be given considerable preferential treatment, so it has not been further investigated. In addition, smuggling is not a criminal offense in law. Even if a large-scale smuggling case is uncovered, at most the goods will be confiscated. Because it is too lenient, it is not enough to have a deterrent effect. The competent authorities submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance six months ago, advocating that the "Regulations on the Punishment of Smuggling and Evasion of Customs Duties" be strictly enforced against smuggling. In this regulation, smugglers, regardless of nationality, are criminal offenders. It is now known that this regulation has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, but it has not yet been forwarded, so it cannot be enforced.</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Merits and Demerits of Levying National Construction Donations: Speaker Pan's Earnest Plea, Hoping the Authorities Can Rectify Tax Collection Agencies</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] At the enlarged symposium on levying national construction donations held on the afternoon of the 22nd, Shanghai Municipal Assembly Speaker Pan Gongzhan deeply analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of levying property donations. Representing the citizens of Shanghai, he made an earnest plea, hoping for the rectification of tax collection agencies to prevent them from becoming self-enriching intermediaries. He believed that instead of starting the levy from ten billion yuan and including real estate, which would cause nationwide unrest, it would be more fair to negotiate with the Americans and first levy or borrow from Chinese people's deposits in the United States. This would also refresh the people's perception. Mr. Pan spoke generously today and cited various examples in Shanghai as proof. After Speaker Pan's speech, Finance Minister Yu and Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department, both stated that any tax personnel found to be engaged in corruption would be severely punished if evidence was found. Speaker Pan also cited facts as examples and was willing to bear the responsibility of providing evidence. The main points of Mr. Pan's speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Pan first pointed out that the levy of property donations is of great importance. If handled well, it can help the national treasury and boost people's confidence. However, if handled improperly, it will not only fail to supplement revenue but also cause disturbances, resulting in more harm than good. Therefore, before the levy, issues such as the investigation methods, the target of collection, and whether to levy from legal entities in addition to natural persons should all be carefully considered. Now, I would like to share with you the opinions I have recently gathered from the Shanghai Municipal Assembly and business community.</p>
<p>First, whether the property donation can be successfully levied depends primarily on whether the financial authorities have the determination to rectify the tax collection agencies. In the recent standard tax inspection conducted in Shanghai, auditors often demand "percentages." Businessmen suffer losses but dare not speak out. Currently, it is said that the price is as high as one percent. This point can be reported to the Minister of Finance. If this phenomenon is not eliminated, then when property donations are levied in the future, the government will definitely receive less than those who are enriching themselves.</p>
<p>Second, whether the collection tools are adequate and effective is also worth considering. In Shanghai's profit tax process, after the account books are taken away by the auditors, an appointment is made to "talk" at Guanshengyuan Restaurant. What exactly is discussed is self-evident. Therefore, all tax collection agencies must be rectified. As for the target of collection, I support politically motivated levies, as this can refresh the people's perception and have the significance of redistributing wealth. However, when levying, natural persons should be the target, not legal entities. Under the current circumstances, very few companies, factories, or businesses have assets less than ten billion. If levies are added to legal entities, then none will be spared. As for levying on real estate, it is best not to levy on all real estate, as Shanghai rents are very high and most of them are pocketed by intermediaries. Now, let me tell you a heartbreaking story. A widow in Shanghai has a three-bay storefront on the main road, and the estimated value of the property is over ten billion. The store is profitable due to its central location, but the widow's rental income is minimal, barely enough to support her family. So she filed a complaint in front of her property, lamenting her plight. If property is levied in the future, those with over ten billion will be taxed one or two percent. How can she afford this tens of millions of yuan in property donations? She will inevitably have to donate a corner of the house. Furthermore, starting the levy at ten billion yuan will absolutely not work. Currently, prices have increased to 30,000 times pre-war levels. Should someone with 33,300 yuan before the war be considered a wealthy person? This point is worth considering. I hope that after the property donation is levied, small fish are not caught in the net while large fish are not caught at all, or even because the net opening is not large enough, the large fish cannot enter the net. As for levying on the wealthy, there are many Chinese people with foreign exchange deposits abroad, and it is said that the list is known to some. Why not announce it immediately? Since the government lacks foreign exchange, why not start the property tax levy from this source? In the past, some said that foreigners were unwilling to announce the names of depositors, but today, American businessmen in China are deeply dissatisfied with Chinese people's deposits in the United States. It is said that Wedemeyer also raised this point with our government. Why don't we take this opportunity to make a counter-request? If foreigners are willing to help, they can first announce the list, which will benefit our collection. If not levied, borrowing is also acceptable. Since our country has borrowed from foreigners, there is no reason why we cannot borrow from our own people. If we do not plan for this and are preoccupied with catching small fish, causing nationwide unrest, how can this be considered fair?</p>
<p>Third, regarding the collection agencies, according to the collection plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance, there are reporting agencies, evaluation agencies, supervisory agencies, and collection agencies. Before the donation and tax are collected, agencies are first established, and there are many titles. How much will be collected in the future is still unknown, but the expenses will be in the thousands upon thousands. All provinces and cities have financial departments and bureaus, which are branches of the central government. Why not utilize them instead of establishing new organizations? The property donation is levied to meet the central government's needs, not to support the agencies.</p>
<p>Fourth, the original plan has provisions for rewarding whistleblowers. All of this will only cause more disturbances, and there is no need to set them up separately.</p>

<h3>Major Annihilation War Launched in Southern Henan: National Army Recovers Xiangcheng and Advances Rapidly Day and Night; Joint Land and Air Forces Tighten Encirclement</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch of the 22nd] A major annihilation war has been launched in southern Henan. On the 21st, the National Army north and south of the Shaying River recovered Xiangcheng. After Shenqiu, they advanced rapidly towards Runan and Xincai in separate routes day and night. On the 21st, the Liu bandit's 1st and 7th Columns attempted to flee west of the Pinghan Railway but were intercepted by the National Army in the area east of Queshan and Zhumadian. Unable to withstand the attack, they turned back and fled. Currently, National Army troops along the Pinghan Railway are arriving in a steady stream with strong forces. On the 22nd, the joint land and air forces of the National Army tightened the encirclement of the Liu bandit's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns, which had fled and occupied the triangular area of the Honghe and Runan rivers from the northeast, west, and south.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch of the 22nd] Liu Bocheng's main force, passing through southern Henan, arrived at Zhengyang, with the vanguard approaching the Pinghan Railway. According to military observers, the Dabie Mountains lack food, and their proximity to the Yangtze River makes them vulnerable to encirclement and annihilation. It is highly unlikely that Liu's troops will flee there. Observing their escape route, they are bound to flee into the Tongbai Mountains, hoping to replenish and prolong their existence. The local Eighth Route Army units led by Wei Fenglou and Li Renlin are still harassing the north bank of the Shaying River. The National Army is currently seeking to annihilate their main force.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 21st] The remnants of the Liu Bocheng bandit gang, the 1st and 6th Columns, totaling more than 18,000 men, fled from Xiangcheng to Longkouji, 40 miles north of Xincai, on the night of the 19th. A nearby unit fled to Wanjindian, 60 miles southeast of Runan, on the morning of the 20th, and continued to flee to the vicinity of Handong, 30 miles southwest of Wanjindian, in the afternoon. Another unit of about 5,000 men fled to Anji, 30 miles south of Shangshui, at dawn on the 20th, and continued to flee to Baigumiao, more than 20 miles east of Shangcai, at noon. The 2nd Column, after fleeing south from Shenqiu, has now arrived in the Linquan and Taihe areas. The main force of Wei Fenglou's bandit troops is cooperating with a unit of Liu's bandits in the vicinity of Zhoujiakou, seemingly to cover Liu's southward escape. Observing the bandit situation in the border area of Henan and Anhui in recent days, it is still undecided how Liu Bocheng's bandit troops, who are struggling desperately like trapped beasts, will break free from the National Army's encirclement to prolong their existence. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch of the 22nd] The bandits in southern Shanxi are stepping up their efforts to support the Liu bandits fleeing in Henan and continue to move south. The 22nd Brigade fled from Anyi to Zhangmao Avenue. The communist bandits in Wenxi are also moving south in the same direction. The 23rd Brigade fled from Anyi to Yangcheng. The so-called "Democratic Allied Army" 55th Division fled and arrived at Yuanqu. The areas left behind by the various bandit units are being taken over by the bandit's independent regiments and local armed forces.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 22nd] The military progress of bandit suppression in Shandong Province is rapid and has entered the pacification stage. The Shandong Provincial Government has specifically instructed the county governments of Jiaodong to actively prepare for recovery work and enter the county territory at the appropriate time. Currently, all personnel of the Changi County Government have departed from Weixian with the army and arrived in Changi. The Pingdu and Zhucheng County Governments are actively organizing cadres in various districts and townships and sending assault teams to enter the county territory to prepare for the return of the local residents.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 22nd] After the National Army recovered Changi, it continued to advance along the road. The Ministry of Transportation is cooperating with the military to urgently repair the highway between Yantai and Weixian and has been ordered to start. The Qingji Highway is being urgently repaired, and military vehicles will be able to pass freely within three days. Commercial vehicles are expected to be open by the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 22nd] The Highway Administration Section here has sent people to survey the highway west of Gaomi to speed up repairs. Except for the Dagu River, which is temporarily difficult to pass due to rising water levels, the Weihe Bridge has been repaired. If the weather continues to be sunny, the Qingji Highway is expected to be open to traffic by the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 22nd] After the National Army on the eastern and western routes of the Jiaoji Railway joined forces, the communist bandits between Shangmi and Fangzi have been cleared. The remnant bandits retreated to the area between Yexian, Laiyang, and Pingdu. The National Army will step up its attacks on the above-mentioned areas.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch of the 22nd] The National Army's bandit-sweeping corps in western Shandong completely cleared the remnant bandits in the Jiaxiang, Yuncheng, and Longguji areas on the 21st. The remnants of the Chen bandit's 1st and 4th Columns broke through and fled to the Wenshangji and Anlingji (north of Chengwu) area. The National Army is in pursuit. In the past week, more than 7,000 bandits in western Shandong have surrendered to the National Army.</p>

<h3>Memorandum to the German Envoy from Prominent Figures in Shanghai, Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>Furthermore, we believe that due to differing traditions of Eastern and Western civilizations and varying levels of political sophistication, a political system of any "coalition government" clinging to the form of political parties may not be the best way to address our country's current crisis. You are also aware that the continued class representing the majority of our people is where the core strength of true free individuals lies. This class cannot be represented by any party or professional politician. This group has collaborated with revolutionaries to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and Hongxian's imperial regime, participated in the National Revolution of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China to eliminate warlords and corrupt officials, and pioneered the path of democratic politics in our country. They have spared no effort to rise up united and fight alongside our American and British allies to achieve victory. However, you also know that the ancient sayings, "A gentleman is ashamed to speak of profit and honor," and "A gentleman associates widely but does not form factions," are still followed by the majority of our people. The "Chinese coalition government" in the minds of people in your country's government and public seems to be a "coalition government" jointly organized by various parties (parties with a developed party system), believing that this can solve all difficulties. However, today, our country's political development is still in its infancy, and there are few with foresight and political strategies and policies sufficient to shoulder heavy responsibilities and overcome difficulties. Therefore, such parties are still largely limited by reality, only knowing how to maneuver, and may not each have distinct political programs to adhere to. If a "coalition government" is formed by such parties, it will not be considered representative of the majority of the people. If you continue to adhere to the usual practices of Western party politics, ignore the opinions and efforts of the majority of free individuals in our country, and mistakenly believe in any "coalition government" that emphasizes form over substance, without considering how to enable the government to gain the support of the majority of good people in our country, then you may still have regrets in solving our country's pressing problems. This is the third point that should be noted.</p>
<p>We deeply believe that your trip will be successful. Given the close relationship between China and the United States, your report of the facts after returning home will greatly help our government and people in addressing the current crisis and laying the foundation for recovery. We deeply believe that world prosperity and world security are inseparable. The urgent efforts of our people today are completely the same as the hopes of your people for us, namely: (1) stabilizing currency values, (2) revitalizing rural areas, (3) promoting economic and international trade, (4) restoring transportation and local order, and (5) providing guarantees sufficient to safeguard world collective security and the sanctity of treaties. All of this will depend on the sympathy and assistance of you and your country's government and people. We are well aware that our country's economic policies for reconstruction and nation-building will move towards a free economic system that is in line with the Principle of People's Livelihood. This is not only expected by our friendly allies but also the historical desire of our people nationwide. Our government has repeatedly and solemnly stated that it sincerely welcomes international investment, which is evident to people both in China and abroad. In recent years, British and American merchants in China have inevitably developed some resentment due to occasional difficulties encountered in their own businesses. We believe that the existence of such unevenness will require time to correct: First, the general social and economic situation must be improved, so that some controls can be gradually lifted (these controls are actually inconvenient for both Chinese and foreigners alike). The recent moderate opening of the foreign exchange market is one example. Second, both sides must review and correct themselves automatically. Our government and people should be able to implement the spirit of a free economic system and eliminate all obstacles as much as possible. And our American, British, and other allied business people in China must also abandon some traditional concepts of the past century, face up to the requirements of our country's reconstruction, and, based on the understanding that should exist after the abolition of unequal treaties, engage in commerce and mutual benefit with the Chinese business community. We firmly believe that in the near future, our country will surely strive for innovation and have a firm and strong government that can truly represent the will of the people to faithfully implement this Principle of People's Livelihood free economic policy that meets the needs of the country and the people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is something else that must be told to you: International trade must involve mutual exchange of goods between each other in order to be permanently smooth and mutually beneficial. If foreign merchants operating in China only know how to sell foreign goods in China without engaging in assisting our country in increasing its export trade, then the accumulated trade deficit will inevitably block the gateway to Sino-foreign trade due to our country's lack of "US dollars." And who will suffer from this? In short, any suggestions from you, any technical, economic, financial, or spiritual assistance from your government or people, if they do not ignore the three points mentioned above and can respect Chinese sovereignty as a prerequisite, we firmly believe that it will be easy to obtain the welcome and cooperation of the majority of our people. Before parting, we respectfully present these points for your consideration, and we wish you all success in your mission, and we ask you to convey our gratitude and greetings from us and the citizens of Shanghai to President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, members of Congress, and the people of your country upon your return.</p>

<h3>Planning Shipping Routes in the Qiantang River Estuary, the Seawall Engineering Bureau Plans to Send Ships for Survey Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] Since the Tagu ocean liner ventured into Hangzhou Bay, passing through Biezimen and entering the Qiantang River, setting a new record, all parties have placed great hope on the opening of the Qiantang shipping route. Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, recently personally inspected the channel and told reporters upon returning to Hangzhou that there is absolutely no problem in opening shipping routes to Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places. The winds and waves along the way are actually smaller than in the open sea, and slightly larger ocean liners can sail directly without hindrance. Therefore, the most urgent issue to be resolved is the route. The Seawall Engineering Bureau will specially dispatch steamships starting next month to survey the depth in order to facilitate the entry and exit of ocean liners.</p>
<p>Also: It was previously rumored that American experts claimed that destroying the Zhelong and Erlong mountains on the Qiantang River would eliminate the Qiantang River flood. According to Wang, this was fabricated by those who do not understand modern geography. The fact that these two mountains are the exit of the Qiantang River is seen in Ming Dynasty historical records. Due to the changes of the sea and land, the Qiantang River's exit to the sea is no longer here today, so blasting the mountains has nothing to do with stopping the flood.</p>
<h3>Ten Counties in Zhejiang Report Disasters</h3>
<p>Serious Drought Along the Shangtang River</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] Ten counties in Zhejiang have been hit by disasters this summer, including Shaoxing, Dongyang, Pujiang, and Yiwu, which have been hit by wind and rain; Ningbo and Ruian have been hit by insect plagues; Yongjia has been hit by both imperial insects and plagues; Shangyu and Longquan have been hit by floods; and Linhai has been hit by drought. The provincial government has forwarded the reports to the Executive Yuan, requesting disaster relief.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Provincial Governor Shen, accompanied by Deputy Director Wang of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, inspected the disaster situation along the Shangtang River. The land on both sides of the river for more than 20 kilometers was cracked. If there is no rain within seven days, there will be no harvest of grain. The water released from West Lake only flows a short distance out of Hangzhou City. Because the drought has been too long, it has been intercepted by nearby farmers and drained completely. Currently, in the Linping area, those who have dug ponds are using manpower to draw water to irrigate the farmland, which costs 300,000 for one acre. Rice fields are unable to afford this high price for irrigation and will be allowed to wither and turn yellow. Sugarcane fields need a lot of water, and they are buying water for irrigation. However, farmers are worried about what to do after the pond water is used up. In addition to the Seawall Engineering Bureau having three water pumps to pump canal water into the Shangtang River and continuing to release water from West Lake, the water plant has also been ordered to pump water for four hours for agricultural use. At the same time, Director Sun of the Executive Yuan Zhejiang Office and Director Pi of the Construction Office have jointly gone to Shanghai to urge the delivery of water pumps for emergency relief.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Re-Emergence of the Gold Nationalization Issue</h3>
<p>On the 15th of this month, the State Council passed revisions to the foreign exchange regulations, which still stipulate the crackdown on gold speculation and the prohibition of foreign currency circulation. However, many people have speculated that these two speculative items will soon appear on the market in new forms. Because the US dollar and foreign exchange are essentially the same thing, and although gold and foreign exchange are not absolutely linked, their relationship is extremely close, so there is no reason to maintain the status quo for long. Now that the exchange of US dollars has been determined in principle through twelve plenary sessions and implementation is being planned, the gold issue will naturally be resolved again.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors in the market that gold will be nationalized, or that the government will purchase gold. Upon closer examination, the first statement may not be very reliable. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>Why would the government want to nationalize gold? To sum up, there are three possible reasons: (1) to prepare reserves after currency reform; (2) to replenish foreign exchange funds; (3) to prevent it from flowing into the private sector, which may have adverse economic and financial consequences. These are all valid reasons. But the question is: does the government currently have the huge sum of money needed for the purchase? Will it deepen the degree of currency inflation and worsen the financial and economic situation? If gold bonds are issued to finance the purchase, will it be possible to promote them successfully under the current circumstances? If confiscation is enforced without compensation, it would infringe on the legitimate rights of private individuals, which is absolutely impossible and has already been stated by the authorities. Since this path is blocked, then there is only one way to buy at the official price. However, if the official price is set too low, such as at the current 4.8 million, it is essentially the same as a dummy setting; and if it is set too high, it can make the general holders willing to sell, but it will inevitably cause the problem of purchasing funds. Therefore, the gold nationalization matter, in the current reality, seems to have very little possibility.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of purchase. If enforced purchase is carried out, with a deadline for completion, the situation will be no different from what was described above. Therefore, what is actually feasible seems to be only to appropriately revise the official price, raise it to a reasonably reasonable level, so that the exchange by the public and the purchase by the government are carried out in a free and indefinite manner, which may be less difficult.</p>
<p>Some people believe that since foreign exchange can be bought and sold at market prices, gold should be allowed to circulate freely without further control. This is naturally the simplest and easiest method. Moreover, the difficulties of the silver industry and the large amount of deadlocked gold can be found a way out, and a way to save money can be found when there is surplus funds and no other way to use them. The question is still whether gold speculation will stimulate prices. According to the past situation of mutual stimulation between gold prices and commodity prices, the drawbacks are indeed terrible. Now the public is demanding a stable life, and the government is also striving to stabilize people's livelihoods. Whether the so-called gold market should be fully opened is indeed worthy of consideration. Weighing the pros and cons, considering the severity, the timing seems to be too early!</p>
<h3>Aspiring Young People Aspire to Join the Army</h3>
<p>Shanghai will start enlisting volunteers for the army on the 25th of this month. According to the Ministry of National Defense's troop quota, Shanghai should enlist 3,000 active-duty soldiers and complete the enlistment and training by September 15. This is the first time that Shanghai has promoted military service, and most people are not very clear about the enlistment methods and procedures. However, the success or failure of the first military service will have a great impact on the atmosphere of military administration. Therefore, we must pay close attention to this volunteer enlistment.</p>
<p>According to the spirit of the Military Service Law, the conscription system should be implemented nationwide to establish a national emphasis on military affairs and lay the foundation for national defense. For expedient measures, the military service organs and local governments may implement a volunteer system in accordance with the supplementary provisions of the Military Service Law to achieve the purpose of troop recruitment with simplified procedures. Shanghai has a population of more than 4 million, with a total of 23,537 men of active duty age. If 3,000 people are conscripted according to law, it will not be a problem. Now, changing conscription to recruitment (volunteers should be called recruits in the military system) does not tarnish the dignity of the Military Service Law in theory. However, if the promotion of volunteer enlistment fails, it will affect the subsequent normal conscription and the atmosphere of military administration throughout the country. Recently, looking at the efforts of the Shanghai military service organs, the development of the military service association, and the supervision of the public opinion organs, its work and its deployment are practical and orderly, and the future seems quite optimistic. As long as aspiring men strive to be the first, everyone moves forward, and eagerly join the army, I believe that Shanghai's first implementation of military service will achieve amazing results and become a model for the country.</p>
<p>Serving in the military is a national duty that every citizen should fulfill. Everyone has this duty, which cannot be evaded; and everyone has this right, which cannot be taken away. Military service is divided into two systems, conscription and recruitment. Although the methods are different, the goals are the same. Conscription is based on compulsion, while recruitment is based on volunteering. Conscription involves designating active-duty men of age among the population to enlist and serve in the military according to law. Violators will obstruct military service and violate criminal law. Volunteers, on the other hand, use a call-up method to encourage aspiring young people to join the army and do not use coercive measures, allowing aspiring men to consciously strive for a good opportunity to serve the country. This year, Shanghai will promote military service, focusing on volunteers and supplementing with conscription, and recently announced the "Shanghai Measures for Enlisting Volunteers," with a total of eleven articles, which were published in newspapers. Analyzing the content of the measures, it is very much in line with the principle of fairness. The thoughtfulness and the preferential treatment for volunteer enlistment are all very beneficial to the promotion of military service.</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly describe the content of the conscription and volunteer measures. According to the regulations, any man between the ages of 20 and 30 who is physically healthy, has a clean background, and has never participated in a communist organization can enlist. Qualified volunteers will be given a settlement fee of 50,000 yuan at one time, and a settlement subsidy fee of 4 million yuan will be given, which will be distributed in two installments before entering the camp. In order to avoid desertion and fraudulent acquisition of settlement fees, it is stipulated that volunteers should obtain a reliable guarantee when enlisting. If there is desertion, the guarantor is responsible for compensating for the loss, so volunteers and guarantors have joint and several military service responsibilities. For the sake of the safety of military administration, joint and several guarantees can also prevent crimes that obstruct military service and have considerable social legislative significance. The spirit of these measures has considerable legitimacy. As for whether volunteers should enjoy the preferential rights listed in the Military Service Law after entering the service, the measures do not specify. According to law, volunteers who serve in the active service should enjoy the various preferential rights listed in the Military Service Law. Therefore, we believe that this volunteer enlistment in Shanghai has the advantages of both conscription and recruitment, and should have an effective harvest for the inspiration of aspiring young people.</p>
<p>September 15th is approaching soon. I hope that the aspiring young people of Shanghai will recognize the advantages of the volunteer system, set their goals, and when military service registration begins, everyone will strive to be the first, everyone will move forward, register for the army, establish special merits for the country, establish a new atmosphere for military administration, and create a new life for new young people, washing away the accumulated shame of our country's youth.</p>

<h3>Jiang Jiadong Will Fly to Yogyakarta on a Special Plane to Investigate the Situation of Overseas Chinese on the Ground. Indonesia Expresses Its Determination Not to Surrender to the Netherlands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 22nd Broadcast: The Indonesian Republic News Agency said: The Chinese government has dispatched a special plane to Batavia to transport Chinese Consul General Jiang Jiadong to Yogyakarta to investigate the situation of overseas Chinese in the occupied areas of Indonesia. It is reported that the Indonesian Republic government, in view of the fact that most of the information obtained by Jiang is distorted, has made this suggestion.</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 22nd] The Indonesian Republic has today sent a formal memorandum to the Chinese government. It stated that the Indonesian government cannot be responsible for the damage and terror suffered by the Chinese people in the area after the withdrawal of Indonesian administrative and military authorities from a certain area, especially when the area is controlled by the enemy. The memorandum stated that the most appropriate way to protect overseas Chinese is for the Chinese government to send official representatives to Indonesia. Previously, Chinese Consul General Jiang Jiadong in Batavia had suggested to the Republic government that a Chinese self-defense force be organized in the Republic's territory to protect the Chinese people, but this suggestion has been rejected.</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia, 21st] Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir broadcast to the Indonesian people tonight, urging them to continue to fight the Dutch and resolutely not succumb to coercion. Sjahrir also estimated that since the ceasefire order came into effect on August 4, the Dutch army has advanced 88 miles in western Java, 54 miles in central Java, about 94 miles in eastern Java, and about 30 miles in Sumatra. He also refuted Governor-General Van Mook's claim in his broadcast last night that the Indonesian Republic was controlled by Japanese forces, pointing out that the Dutch did not give the Indonesians an appropriate method of resistance and surrendered to the Japanese immediately. He also said that the Dutch's failure to educate the Indonesians allowed Japanese forces to infiltrate Indonesian society.</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia, 21st] Yogyakarta Radio said: Governor-General Van Mook had made four demands to the Indonesian Republic, and these four demands were not included in Van's English speech distributed to reporters. These requirements are: (1) Indonesia must stop violent actions; (2) Indonesia must stop conflicts; (3) The order to destroy and terrorize must be withdrawn; (4) The intimidation and threatening orders issued to those who recognize their own responsibilities and are therefore regarded as enemies of the Republic must be withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Stalemate in US-Soviet Joint Commission; US Decides to Aid South Korean Reconstruction; Marshall's Letter Still Awaits Soviet Reply</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] It is reported that the United States has virtually abandoned hope of resolving the Korean issue with the Soviet Union. It is now intensifying preparations to support the economy of the US-occupied zone of South Korea as the only means of countering Soviet obstruction of Korean unification.</p>
<p>US officials stated that the economic austerity mentality of the 18th US Congress, coupled with the hopelessness of reaching a common US-Soviet agreement on Korea, has delayed the multi-million dollar reconstruction plan for Korea. However, the fact that the Soviet side did not respond to Marshall's request for a report when US-Soviet talks on Korea reached a stalemate has made this issue even clearer. They stated that the US administration will expedite the submission of a Korean plan early next year, which may cost up to $100 million. The report also indicated that if Congress takes further aid action for Korea, this amount may increase beyond the current $137 million military occupation budget for this fiscal year. It is also learned that the US government is currently seeking a high-ranking, capable civilian official to take charge of the administration of the US-occupied zone of Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 22nd] The representative of the Soviet side, Shtikov, today accused the US military authorities of oppressing Korean democratic parties and left-wing social organizations, stating that the Soviet delegation insists on immediately taking measures to restore normal Joint Commission negotiations. Many democratic leaders have been arrested by the US military authorities, and democratic parties and South Korean people who actually support the Moscow Resolution and the work of the Joint Commission have been oppressed. However, Lieutenant General Hodge expressed surprise at the Soviet accusations, stating that those arrested by the US side were of no political significance.</p>
<h3>Soviet Rule; Asian Plan; Report by US Journalist</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Chicago Daily News correspondent Hulse, in a report on Korean news, stated that the US-Soviet stalemate may force the United States to continue occupying South Korea even after withdrawing from Japan. It is generally believed that the Wedemeyer Mission's task is to change US policy on Far Eastern issues and adopt a tougher approach to Soviet control. If the United States withdraws from Korea, Korea will be controlled by the Communists. Even if the United States and the Soviet Union withdraw from Korea simultaneously, the 150,000 Korean troops trained by the Communists in North Korea will eventually take over the entire Korean peninsula. At the same time, Chicago Tribune reporter Simms, in a report, discussed the Asian plan under Soviet rule. He said that the plan includes: (1) North Korea has been thoroughly communized and will be permanently occupied; (2) North Korea will be merged into a large group comprising Northeast China, Eastern Siberia, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and Outer Mongolia. If conditions are favorable and Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are allowed to secede from China, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia will also be added; (3) South Korea will be seized as soon as the United States is unwilling to support it; (4) Japan will be incorporated into the Soviet bloc to encircle China. Regarding the close ties between North Korea under Soviet occupation and the Chinese Communists in Northeast China, Simms said that grain from Northeast China has been transported to North Korea, and tens of thousands of Korean soldiers have joined the Chinese Communists in combat. When the Chinese Communists in Northeast China are oppressed by the National Army, they flee to North Korea.</p>
<h3>Three US Soldiers Arrested in North Korea; Soviets Agree to Release</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 22nd] According to reliable sources, the Soviet authorities in Pyongyang, North Korea, have informed the US liaison officer that the three US soldiers arrested by the Soviet side will be released "once we are ready." The Soviet side refused to disclose where the three US soldiers were arrested ten days ago or for what reason. Meanwhile, a US liaison officer stationed in Pyongyang has left for Seoul to report the matter.</p>
<h3>New Plan to Restore Peace in Vietnam; French Government Reaches Agreement; Bollaert Leaves France for Saigon Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Official news: The French government has reached an agreement on a peace plan for Vietnam, which will be given final approval by a special cabinet meeting tonight or tomorrow. Vietnamese Governor Bollaert stated at a meeting with some cabinet members today that a full agreement on the plan has in fact been reached, awaiting only a study of other minor details by the full cabinet meeting and approval of the government's entire new plan before it is completed. Bollaert also said that he plans to leave Paris on Saturday so that he can return to Saigon on August 26, and then go to Hanoi to broadcast the French government's peace plan to the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Commissioner Bollaert, special representative to Vietnam, today denied reports from Hong Kong that France is about to declare Vietnam's independence and be ruled by former Annam King Bao Dai.</p>
<h3>Striving to Overcome Severe Economic Crisis; Britain Launches Agricultural Production Increase; Special Appropriation of 400 Million Yuan to Assist Farmers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Minister of Agriculture Williams today launched a large-scale four-year agricultural plan, expecting to increase production by more than 100 million pounds within four years to reduce the burden of purchasing grain from abroad. Williams emphasized that this plan requires unprecedented effort in the history of agriculture. If this goal is unfortunately not achieved, the British people will face widespread malnutrition and widespread unemployment.</p>
<p>The new production volume in the plan will exceed the highest domestic agricultural record during the war when Britain was blockaded by Hitler's submarines by more than 50%. The increased agricultural products should focus on food that originally had to be paid in US dollars, such as pork, eggs, beef, lamb, grains, and flaxseed. The government plans to expand the wheat and barley planting areas, and open another 400,000 acres of flaxseed planting area. The wheat planting area is expected to increase by 50 acres next year, and the number of pigs is expected to triple by 1951-52.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 21st] The British government has just announced an appropriation of $400 million for food production increase plans.</p>
<h3>Argentina and Sweden React to New British Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Argentina's decision to stop issuing all import foreign exchange permits and Sweden's decision to stop buying goods from the sterling area are the fastest and most important reactions to the British government's decision to stop redeeming pound sterling. The measures announced by Argentina are even more important than those announced by Sweden, as the suspension of imports includes imports from any part of the world. What impact this will have on Argentina's international finances, or whether Britain is about to negotiate a new trade and financial system with Argentina, is still unclear.</p>
<h3>President Truman Appoints Army, Navy, and Air Force Secretaries; New Secretary of Defense to Officially Take Office in Mid-September</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman announced at a press conference today that he has appointed Under Secretary of the Air Force Symington as the Secretary of the Air Force, and Under Secretary of the Navy Sullivan as the Secretary of the Navy to succeed Forrestal's vacancy. Secretary of the Army Royal will remain in his position, but will not be a member of the cabinet. These measures will take effect once the newly appointed Secretary of Defense Forrestal officially takes office in mid-September.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] President Truman stated at a press conference on the 21st that he may again request Congress to legislate to allow more immigrants to enter the United States. The President said that he is making every effort to have a fixed policy for European migrants, but there is currently no new way to solve this problem. Americans are all descendants of immigrants, so they all have a responsibility to do their part.</p>
<h3>US Plans to Invite Canada to Participate in Pan-American Joint Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Petropolis, Brazil, 21st] The United States suggested on the 21st that a clause be added to the Pan-American Joint Defense Treaty to allow Canada to be included in the Americas if it wishes. Except for a small portion of colonial territories of some European countries, the area of the countries participating in the mutual joint defense treaty is nearly 15 million square miles.</p>
<h3>Britain Continues to Draw on US Loans; $450 Million; Remaining Portion to be Frozen Indefinitely</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] US Treasury officials announced today that Britain has drawn another $150 million from its loan from the US today. Britain can draw another $150 million each on August 25th and 29th, and the remaining $400 million will be frozen indefinitely. According to the US-UK financial negotiations that began in Washington on Monday, the loan had a remaining balance of $850 million. The US has approved the continued withdrawal of $450 million, which is to be used to pay for goods already ordered from the US. Three senior US officials were unable to provide any definite date as to when Britain can resume accepting pound sterling and when the frozen loan can be unfrozen.</p>
<p>However, they pointed out that the Bank of England still needs considerable time to establish the necessary institutions to investigate currency exchange conditions. The two technical committees of the US-UK economic talks continued their work today. The trade committee is studying the clause in the US-UK loan agreement that prohibits discrimination against imports from the dollar area, while the financial committee is continuing to review Britain's dollar situation.</p>
<h3>Britain Restricts Travelers from Carrying Pound Sterling Notes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The Treasury announced today that from August 23, the amount of pound sterling notes that travelers entering and leaving the United Kingdom are allowed to carry will be reduced from the original 20 pounds to 5 pounds.</p>

<h3>Laborers Believe in Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai Gas Company Employees Once Went on Strike to Fight for Consultant</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] More than 200 employees of the British Shanghai Gas Company had previously demanded that the company hire additional Chinese medicine consultants, but the company refused. The reason was that the company already had complete Western medicine clinic facilities and there was no need to set up Chinese medicine. Although the Social Affairs Bureau subsequently approved the additional hiring in consideration of the habits of the Chinese people, it was still rejected by Sinbo, the chief engineer of the company. At 8 am yesterday, the union convened a New Chang meeting, and misunderstandings occurred between the two parties. The employees stopped working at 9 am. The company immediately represented the Social Affairs Bureau to report the matter. Director Shen and Section Chief Fan came forward to mediate and asked the employees to resume work first and then discuss the matter. The employees accepted the advice and gradually resumed work in the afternoon. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene both parties within days to discuss and resolve the unfinished matters. When the work was stopped, the workers of the third shift (emergency repair department) still maintained work as usual, so the gas supply was kept uninterrupted.</p>

<h3>Great World Dance Hall Dancers Accuse Manager, No Drug Addiction Found, Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yuan Wei and Hou Liumei, representing all the dancers of the Great World Dance Hall, accused the dance hall manager Liu Quanbai of drug use. The case was heard in court yesterday. The accusers did not appear in court. According to the defendant Liu Quanbai, he has been working at the Great World Dance Hall for seven years. He used to smoke opium during the period of enemy occupation, but he quit after the victory. This time, the dancers first accused him of exploitation at the Old Zhabei Police Substation and then accused him of drug use.

The case was dismissed in court, and Liu was released on bail of 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Profiting from Selling Conscripts, Two Cases Cracked, Multiple Arrests</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yu Peiyuan, through his friend Zhang Rengen, sold a watch to Yang Meifang. Because the mechanism was not good, Yang wanted to return the watch. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a fight broke out on Nanjing Road. As a result, they were brought to the police station to argue. After investigation by Chief Jiang of the Criminal Division, it was revealed that Shi and Zhang claimed to have met Yang Meifang at the Great World Amusement Park and that Yang was suspected of selling conscripts. For each conscript sold to Ningbo, he could earn 3 million yuan, the introducer would receive a commission of 300,000 yuan, and the conscript would actually receive 1.5 million yuan. The remaining 1.2 million yuan would be used by the transporters to cover travel and food expenses. The brokers Gong Bingsheng and a man surnamed Wu acted as intermediaries, profiting from this. Several batches had already been transported to Ningbo.</p>
<p>Chief Jiang immediately ordered officers to rush to the scene, where they arrested brokers Wang Bingsheng and conscripts Gong Xiaoyou and Xu Xigen. They also went to a secret location and arrested Zhu Zhongliang, a clerk, his wife Wang Suling, and brokers Xie Akun, Wu Afa, Wang Jinshan, Wu Tianxi, Zhou Ade, and eight others. They continued to search and found conscripts Du Zhifang, Li Chungen, and Zhang Erlang. In another hotel, they found a fourteen-year-old boy named Xu Jidong. According to Xu, he was tricked into coming to Shanghai from Jinan, Shandong. He was originally scheduled to be transported in the previous batch, but because he was deemed too short, he was waiting for the next batch. The police substation, because the case involved selling conscripts, plans to hand it over to the garrison headquarters for investigation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Shi Baogen from Nanyan, under the order of Wang Shengfu, the chief of the tenth bao in his hometown, came to Shanghai to buy conscripts. After arriving in Shanghai, Shi contacted a beggar leader surnamed Chen on Sichuan Road the day before yesterday. For 4 million yuan per person, Chen recruited Lu Demin, Ke Zuoqing, Xu Mingxi, and Fang Genfa. Yesterday morning, when paying, they only gave each person 1.3 million yuan. While waiting for the ship at the Bund, all four were unwilling to go, leading to a conflict. The street police arrived, inquired about the situation, and took everyone to the Huangpu Police Station, accusing them of obstructing military service. It is planned to report the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for punishment.</p>

According to the informant, the woman's actions were secretive, resembling those of a child-snatching gang. In addition, children have recently gone missing in the area, so after the woman was arrested, Officer Li interrogated her severely. As a result, he obtained nothing and took her to the team headquarters for torture. Before long, the woman died.

However, someone discovered it and reported it to the Yangsi Police Substation. After sending personnel to investigate and confirm the facts, in addition to detaining the vigilante who caused the incident, they also requested instructions from the headquarters yesterday for handling the matter.</p>

<h3>Securities Firm Privately Trading Gold and Foreign Currency: More Than Twenty People Summoned for Questioning on a Specific Date</h3>

<h3>Shutting Down Illegal Jewish Organization: Unauthorized Establishment of Court Undermines Our Sovereignty</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The "Arbitration Court" of the illegal organization of Jewish expatriates in Shanghai has been sealed off by the Social Affairs Bureau together with the Police Department on the 16th of this month. The German and Austrian Jewish refugees in Shanghai, numbering about 15,000 to 16,000 people, live in the Hongkou area and have formed the "Jewish People's Protection Association," located at No. 22, Lane 412, Tangshan Road. On February 18, 1940, the association established an arbitration court to mediate civil disputes between Jews. The organization procedure of the "Arbitration Court" is divided into a "four-level, four-trial" system, with a total of six people, including judges, assessors, lawyers, and assistant lawyers. Any civil dispute between Jews that has been mediated by the first, second, and third trials of the court and one of the parties is still not satisfied may request a retrial from the fourth trial (supreme court). The person in charge of the Supreme Court is Laskost, the chairman of the Jewish Expatriate Association. After his ruling, both parties must comply and may not have any further objections.</p>
<p>The discovery of this "Arbitration Court" was in May of this year. When Cheng Rui, a judge of the Shanghai High Court, was handling the divorce appeal case between Jewish people Badi Baitlet and Yixue Daobate, he learned from the evidence presented by the appellant Badi Baitlet that the "Jewish Expatriate Association" had set up an "Arbitration Court" on Tangshan Road and was openly accepting cases. The public judgment book contained the main text and reasons for the parties, just like a court judgment. The High Court sent a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting the National Government to review and instruct. Soon, Chairman Chiang telegraphed an order stating that "the arbitration court undermines sovereignty and ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work with the Municipal Government to ban it." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government secretly ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to thoroughly investigate. Yang Zhifang, a specialist from the Second Division of the bureau, confirmed the facts and also found that the "Jewish Expatriate Association" had not registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. Therefore, on the 16th, he went to the association's office to seal it off. He posted a joint announcement by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department at the site and translated the contents of the announcement into English and informed the vice-chairman of the association. However, the association stated that the "court" had already ceased operations.</p>

<h3>Striving Hard Against Foreign Goods: Zhengtai Rubber Factory Actively Produces, Expanding from Small Scale to Three Factories</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] While most people are immersed in air conditioning and poolside relaxation, escaping the annoying heat, how many people are toiling in temperatures often exceeding 150 degrees, constantly sweating for China's industrial construction?</p>
<p>As we stepped into the engine room of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, a moving scene unfolded before our eyes: Thirty-one large mixing machines exuded a palpable heat, and more than a thousand workers were diligently operating in a soaking wet environment. Every day, they supply 30,000 pairs of rubber shoes and more than 1,000 tires to the market, enabling domestically produced rubber products to begin to engage in a close-quarters battle with foreign-made products on roads, sports fields, and rainy days!</p>
<p>Planning to Build New-Type Factory Buildings</p>
<p>China's rubber industry has always struggled under the suppression of foreign goods. Zhengtai Rubber Factory's twenty years of research and operation truly reveals a long and heroic process of China's industry seeking a new life. It started from a small-scale establishment in the 16th year of the Republic of China and has now progressed to three factories operating on a large scale at the same time; starting with the trial production of simple rubber shoes, it is now able to manufacture car tires and V-belts. In the process, they purchased 60 mu of open space on Jungong Road, preparing to build new-type factory buildings; established a physical and chemical laboratory, designed and created automobile tires with the highest physical properties; and effectively prevented cracking by replacing the old-fashioned baking method with "vulcanization" drying and using fillers, accelerators, and the latest coatings. As a result, the reputation of "Warrior Brand" was finally established. This reputation was exchanged for the perseverance and devotion of so many people to domestic industry!</p>
<p>Its Internal Frustration</p>
<p>After we visited the factory's staff and workers' children's school, factory director Yuan Shusen began to talk about the difficulties. He said that the factory's medical expenses for workers and all the expenses of this school alone put a burden on the factory, not to mention the workers' food expenses. Therefore, at least half of the manager's energy is spent on stabilizing the economy. The severity of labor-management problems has now caused general industry to suffer the same pain and depression, and the rubber industry has its own internal frustration in this regard: there are four days of power outages in a month, rubber raw material imports are listed under quotas, sales fields are limited to domestic, and Sino-Japanese trade has been opened up again. Thinking that this industry, which has already reached a considerable scale, will once again encounter a decisive blow in the future, we all let out a disappointed sigh.</p>
<p>More Than Two Thousand Strong Arms</p>
<p>It is said that the work efficiency of general workers is also lower than before the war, because the turbulent economic environment motivates them to want to maintain their pre-war living standards at all times. However, as we walked past the tire making machine, we saw sections of red like the setting sun, passing through the hands full of sweat, being pulled out from the machine, the scorching heat making the workers almost suffocate, they were still patiently and calmly looking for broken layers on the tire skin, for work, for the industry, this loyalty is enough to move us, what reason is there to harshly blame them?</p>
<p>The final finishing and boxing of rubber shoes and military tires are all handled by female workers. From female workers in their forties to teenagers, they silently perform their respective tasks under different ages. These more than two thousand strong arms are filling the past emptiness of China's rubber industry!</p>
<p>When you are turning the wheels of your car, speeding towards the breezy poolside, have you ever thought that someone is wiping sweat and fighting hard against those foreign rubber products?</p>

<h3>Head of UNRRA Denies Early Closure: Director Huo States It Is Not True, Supervisory Office Sends Personnel to Question Accused Staff</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Huo Baoshu, head of UNRRA, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last and went to the office yesterday morning to meet with Li Zhuomin, the deputy director of the agency, and other senior staff. Xu Shichang, the recently dismissed director of the General Affairs Office, was also summoned and questioned for a long time. Regarding the rumor that UNRRA will close early at the end of September, Huo firmly stated that it was not true. UNRRA was originally scheduled to close at the end of this year. After the closure, relief affairs will be handled by the Post-War Relief Committee. The committee is still in the preparation stage. It is generally speculated that the affairs of UNRRA are complicated and that the committee is likely to still be presided over by Huo. It is rumored that Jiang Tingfu, the former head of UNRRA, will make a comeback and be responsible for UNRRA and the Post-War Relief Committee again. People close to Jiang have said that this is definitely impossible.</p>
<p>Chen Jianye, a section chief from the Supervisory Office, went to UNRRA yesterday to investigate and questioned the accused senior staff in detail.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Investigate UNRRA's Account Books: Court Receives Another Secret Report</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] He Huimin, a prosecutor from the District Prosecutor's Office, reviewed UNRRA's relevant account books yesterday. It is rumored that the investigation of the case has come to an end. Prosecutor He said that the investigation of the case has just begun, and it is too early to say that it has come to an end. When reporters asked whether the suspected persons would be summoned for questioning, Prosecutor He said that after reviewing the accounts, if any suspicious points are found, those with serious suspicion will be summoned, but it cannot be decided at this time. Prosecutor He also said that he received a new secret report yesterday with the name "UNRRA Purge Corruption Committee," providing some new clues to the various charges against Li Zhuomin and other six people that have been disclosed in the newspapers. The letter may be the same as the original secret report and was written by people inside UNRRA. Although the letter does not have a responsible person's name, making it impossible to summon them for questioning, the new clues are quite valuable and will be used as a reference to speed up the "investigation."</p>
<h3>Yue Opera School Fundraising, Social Affairs Bureau Urges Completion of Project Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yue opera actresses Yuan Xuefen and others have raised 5 billion yuan to establish a Yue opera school and build an experimental theater, and are specially performing "Shan He Lian" at the Golden Grand Theater. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that before the performance, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed them to prepare a project plan for establishing a drama school and building a theater, determine the fund management methods, and fill out a fundraising application form for approval before proceeding.

<h3>Workers at Pier No. 1 in Nanshi Scramble for Work: Police Suppress, Fortunately No Trouble Caused</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Pier No. 1 in Nanshi and Warehouse No. 1 on the shore were previously the property of Ningshao Shipping Company. After Piers No. 1 to No. 9 in Nanshi were taken over by the Public Works Bureau, Warehouse No. 1 was still managed by Ningshao Company. After the victory, Ningshao Company had no ships to operate, so it leased it to Sanbei Company this year. However, after Sanbei leased it, the warehouse was stationed by military police, making it impossible to take over. It was not until the end of last month that the military police were transferred, and Sanbei took over at the beginning of this month. The workers at Pier No. 1 and the warehouse were employed by Da Ji workers when the military police were stationed. Da Ji was originally approved by the Social Affairs Bureau to work at Pier No. 2, while Piers No. 1 and No. 3 were assigned to Sheng Ji workers. Sheng Ji was originally an old worker of Sanbei, and in the past, he rarely worked at Pier No. 1, so he did not care. After Warehouse No. 1 was taken over by Sanbei Company, Sheng Ji workers went to work at Pier No. 1, but were rejected by Da Ji workers. Although Yu Shunhuai of Sanbei Company acted as a mediator, it was still ineffective. The number of Da Ji workers working at Pier No. 2 was originally limited to 40. If there were more, Sheng Ji would send additional workers. Now, in order to resolve the dispute over Pier No. 1, Sheng Ji expressed its willingness to give up Pier No. 2 and allow Da Ji to work there completely. Hua Daxiu, the foreman of Da Ji, also persuaded the workers not to fight any more, but the workers still refused to listen. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, the two sides gathered a crowd at Pier No. 1 and were about to fight. After the Yimiao Police Substation and the Water Police Team learned about it, they sent police officers to the scene to suppress it, and the situation was finally resolved. The Yimiao Police Substation and the Water Police Team are currently inviting the responsible workers from both sides to mediate. As of yesterday evening, there was still no result.</p>
<h3>Pre-Made Uniforms: Prisoner Plans to Escape, Liu Ziyuan is Recognized, Detention Center Staff Suspected</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Liu Ziyuan, the former judicial section chief of the Yulin Road Police Substation, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was detained at the Masinan Road District Court Detention Center. On July 8, Liu, together with Zhang Hansheng, the mail clerk and guard of the detention center, put on a pre-made guard uniform and strode out of the prison door. When passing through the third iron gate, he was recognized and captured. After questioning, it was determined that he had attempted to escape and was sent to the District Court for handling. The case was heard in court yesterday. According to Liu's statement, he knew from a family letter that his mother was seriously ill and that there were many people in his family, so he thought of escaping home. The guard's hat and badge were stolen, and the Zhongshan suit material was sent by his family and entrusted to Zhang Hansheng to be made in the sewing factory in the detention center, but he did not tell Zhang about the attempted escape. He asked the court to be lenient. Zhang Hansheng stated that Liu's family situation was indeed pitiful, and the Zhongshan suit made from the cloth sent by his family was approved by the operations section of the detention center in advance. He denied any collusion with Liu's escape. The court ordered the sentence to be announced on the 29th of this month.</p>

<h3>鎭安大血案　孫濬伯餘熖未減　重上法堂</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Xi'an dispatch on the 18th] The large-scale bloodbath in Zhen'an County, Southern Shaanxi, which shocked the entire country, involved the former county magistrate of the county, Sun Junbo. This spring, he first seduced the female teacher Wang Min into cohabitation. Afterwards, Ms. Wang, filled with resentment, died of poisoning. This was exposed by Wang's father and the county council, and the latter also revealed other corrupt and illegal acts. Sun then personally led the county government's armed forces on May 2nd, shooting and killing four people, including the Speaker of the Council, Li Weihan, inside and outside Li's residence. Afterwards, he was escorted to the province. In mid-July, the Chang'an District Court sentenced Sun and his two guards to death. Sun and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. The first investigation court session was held this morning, with Yuan Binghui, the head of the criminal court, serving as the presiding judge. More than 700 people attended the hearing, creating an unprecedented crowd.</p>
<p>The criminal Sun wore a yellow khaki uniform, had his hair freshly cut, and looked radiant. He entered the court with his head held high and a steady pace, carrying a briefcase. His imposing manner had not diminished at all. Sun claimed that his discord with Speaker Li was due to Li's default on military grain delivery, and Li's collusion with the provincial councilor of the county, Liu Nanhui, in the smuggling of opium, which was discovered by Sun. He claimed that he and Ms. Wang were old acquaintances of ten years, and Ms. Wang voluntarily married him, with a wedding officiant present. Their relationship after marriage was also happy. Ms. Wang died due to a miscarriage, not from poisoning. He also accused Speaker Li of plotting a riot, evidenced by a large number of military firearms and ammunition found in Li's residence after the incident.</p>
<p>Sun then loudly declared: "I am a revolutionary soldier, a hero, and I am not afraid of death. Speaking of death, I can die here in court. I am appealing only to fulfill my duty." It is said that Sun had previously declared, "If I am found guilty, I will not appeal, I will definitely commit suicide in court." Therefore, he made this statement to "dissipate embarrassment." Sun even said, "Li's death eliminates a scourge for Zhen'an!"</p>
<p>Sun's defense lawyer stated that the first instance of the district court did not pay attention to collecting evidence favorable to the defendant, and only made a judgment based on one-sided testimonies unfavorable to the defendant, which was unfair. He expressed "regret" towards the Xi'an news media's unanimous criticism of Sun Junbo after the incident was exposed, which led to the court being subjected to pressure from public opinion and unable to deliver a fair verdict. This naive inference by the lawyer has aroused widespread resentment in the journalistic circles.</p>
<p>When the two guards who assisted Sun in committing the crime were brought to court, they also denied the murderous acts at the time, attempting to evade the death sentence handed down in the first instance.</p>
<p>One thing that was not understood by the people inside and outside the courtroom was that the two guards had shackles on their feet, while the "County Magistrate" Sun did not have any restraints. He rode in a carriage between the court and the prison.</p>
<p>Whether the second instance will uphold the original judgment is worth watching. (Reporter Mai Ye)</p>
<h3>Qing-Hu Highway Bandits Open Fire: One American Injured, Escapees Flee, One Truck Looted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Qingpu dispatch on the 21st] A hijacking incident occurred on the Qing-Hu Highway this morning, involving the shooting and wounding of an American. Around six o'clock in the morning, more than 20 bandits, hiding on the side of the 14th bridge on the highway (30 miles from the city), were planning their attack when a Jeep driven from Shanghai to Qing arrived. Two American men and two women were inside, on an outing. As the Jeep drove by the side of the bridge, three bandits in grass-green uniforms with fast-firing machine guns rushed out from the roadside, shouting for the car to stop. More than 20 other bandits, fully armed, each with a handgun, swarmed up. The Americans in the car, seeing the unfavorable situation, attempted to draw their guns for self-defense, but the bandits preemptively opened fire. One American was shot and injured on the spot. Another American quickly turned the car around and sped away. The car was slightly damaged by stray bullets, but ultimately escaped and was not intercepted. At the same time, a truck also traveling from Shanghai to Qing, carrying more than 60 fishmongers including Song Liangsheng, intending to transport fish at Fangyao Town on the 11th bridge, arrived behind the Jeep and was unable to escape. It was immediately intercepted by the bandits and looted completely, with no one spared. The losses amounted to around 100 million yuan. The bandits then fled from Liuxia Township towards Songjiang County. The three nearby townships of Fangyao, Hemu, and Xujing, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched self-defense forces to track and encircle the bandits. According to residents of Laozhai Township, the American Jeep that was attacked by the bandits fled in panic, overturning into a field near Laozhai Town (5 miles from the scene). Fortunately, it was rescued by the villagers and driven back to Shanghai. One severely injured American had a bullet enter from the back and exit from the front of his groin. The injury was quite serious, and his life may be in danger. His name is unknown.</p>

<h3>Abusing Daughter-in-Law Provokes Public Outrage: Taiyuan Shrew Paraded Through the Streets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 18th] A case of a mother-in-law abusing her daughter-in-law occurred in Taiyuan City, arousing public outrage, resulting in the unusual event of parading her through the streets as a public display. Hao Chu, the 39-year-old wife of Hao Guangming, who lives at No. 14 Haibian Street, is naturally shrewish. Her eldest son, Fulu, 18, had been engaged by a matchmaker to Tao'er, the daughter of Zhao Yu of No. 14 Luoguo Lane. Zhao is a civil servant, and because his income was not enough to support his family, he sent his beloved daughter to the Hao family as a child bride. After entering the Hao family, Hao Chu treated this child bride with all kinds of abuse. In the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Zhao Yu discussed with his father and received his consent to welcome Tao'er back to her parents' home to complete the wedding according to local customs. The young couple got along extraordinarily well after they got married. Unexpectedly, this greatly increased the resentment of her shrewish mother-in-law, Hao Chu, who abused her daughter-in-law even more. Severe beatings and scolding became commonplace. A few days ago, Fulu received 50,000 yuan in relief funds from the school. Thinking that his wife was often abused and that his wife's family was also poor, he secretly gave all the money to his wife to use as pocket money, without holding back a single penny. Unexpectedly, Hao Chu found out about this. Like an angry lioness, she roared and questioned Tao'er about the source of the money. Tao'er preferred to endure the beating herself and hid the truth. Hao Chu became even more angry and beat her severely with a wooden stick, causing injuries all over her body. At this point, Fulu could no longer bear to stand by and watch, so he resolutely admitted that he had given her the money, and knelt down to plead for her. Unexpectedly, Hao Chu thought that it was her own son who was now protecting his wife, which was extremely rebellious and unfilial, adding fuel to the fire and making her even more furious. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable and fearing his mother's fierce power, Fulu got up from the ground and took the opportunity to sneak away. Hao Chu vented her anger on her daughter and ordered her to go out and look for him. However, the sea of people was vast and unattainable. She wandered the streets until late at night, but did not dare to return home. However, due to the severe injuries she had suffered and the fact that she had not eaten all day, she eventually became exhausted and fainted on a pile of ashes in front of the door. The next day, neighbors found her and rescued her. This tragic incident immediately spread to every household on the street, arousing public outrage. More than a thousand residents gathered at the street office at noon on the 11th to discuss how to deal with the situation. With many opinions flying, everyone agreed to parade Hao Chu through the streets as a public display, and ordered the guarantor to no longer abuse her daughter-in-law in the future. Zhao Tao'er will be temporarily taken back to her relatives for recuperation. A storm finally subsided.</p>

<p>Sewing Thread Industry Representatives Survey Southeast Asian Markets</p>
<p>[Report from This City] The main business of China's sewing thread industry is the production of "wood yarn balls." Before the war, it was widely sold in Southeast Asia, earning a large amount of foreign exchange every year. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, trade with Southeast Asia was interrupted, and China's industry was greatly affected. After the victory, "China Flying Wheel Sewing Thread Factory" successively established distribution agencies in Singapore and Siam to promote business. At a time when Japanese goods are being exported to Southeast Asia, it is heard that Luo Liqun, general manager of Flying Wheel Factory, and his party, flew to Hong Kong on a China Aviation flight at 6:00 AM this morning (23rd) and then transferred to various parts of Southeast Asia to conduct on-site market surveys to seek improvements.</p>

<h3>Revision of Exchange Settlement Methods Increases Coal Mining Costs by 10%</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a responsible person from the Management Committee speaking to reporters: Since the government revised the exchange settlement methods, the direct impact on coal mining is mainly in two areas: (1) pit props, and (2) mining materials. This will generally increase production costs by about 10%. Currently, the only foreign coal used in our country is Hongji white coal. The main coal supply still relies on the mines of Kailuan, Huadong, Huainan, and Taiwan. The 30,000 tons of bituminous coal ordered from Canada by the previous government, over 9,000 tons has arrived by the week before. This time, the government has specifically listed coal per catty as one of the five kinds of materials eligible for official exchange rates. However, it is believed that most of this official-price foreign coal will be reserved for safety coal. In this city, it is planned to increase the safety coal reserve to 300,000 tons in case of insufficient coal supply, to be allocated for regulation and so on.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Slightly Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 2,600 shih of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. Rumors circulated that Hankou was again under blockade, and inland prices were frequently rising.

White yuan remained stable, and yin yuan also rose by ten thousand yuan. New japonica remained temporarily stable. In the northern market, japonica and indica rice sales were very brisk, and both japonica and indica rice rose by ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market is experiencing a sharp rise in prices. Shipments from Qingdao are scarce, and prices are soaring. Raw oil increased sharply by thirty to fifty thousand yuan, rapeseed oil increased sharply by thirty to forty thousand yuan, soybean oil also jumped by twenty to thirty thousand yuan, and refined oil followed suit, rising by twenty to thirty thousand yuan. The supply and demand of sesame oil are both low, and market conditions are firm.</p>

<h3>Sino-Hong Kong Agreement Signed Successfully; Hong Kong Government to Assist Us in Combating Smuggling; Shao Zenghua Completes Mission and Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Deputy Director of the National Bank's Business Bureau, Mr. Shao Zenghua, along with the bank's consultant, Mr. Rogers, flew to Hong Kong earlier last month, representing the National Bank to negotiate financial and economic cooperation issues with the Hong Kong government. They have successfully concluded the negotiations and formally signed the Agreement Memorandum in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. Having completed his mission in Hong Kong, Mr. Shao has returned to Shanghai on the 20th of this month to report on his work.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Shao's discussions with the Hong Kong government during his stay in Hong Kong were quite smooth, and the Hong Kong side expressed great cooperation, which ultimately led to the completion of the agreement signing. Mr. Shao declined to disclose the detailed terms. According to reporters, the scope of the agreement mainly covers the following three points: (1) The Hong Kong side is willing to assist us in combating smuggling of imports and exports. (2) The Hong Kong side is willing to assist us in combating the existence of black market exchange rates for national currency and US dollars in Hong Kong. (3) The Hong Kong government agrees that its US dollar revenue (which mainly comes from remittances from our overseas Chinese and export trade) should, after deducting the amount required by Hong Kong, be used only for Sino-Hong Kong trade and not for trade with third countries. If there is a surplus, the surplus should be resold to the National Bank.</p>
<p>General observers believe that this agreement signed between us and the Hong Kong government will be able to mutually cooperate with the implementation of revised import and export trade and foreign exchange management measures. It is expected that issues such as smuggling in South China and the black market for foreign exchange in Hong Kong can be thoroughly eliminated in the future, thereby removing the threat to our country's financial trade.</p>

<h3>Encouraging Nurse Wang to Work Hard</h3>
<p>This column previously received a letter from Nurse Wang, stating that due to her qualifications, she is often looked down upon by her colleagues. Currently employed at a certain organization, she has also had her base salary reduced by the superior authority due to the lack of a diploma. Having suffered repeated blows, she feels deeply distressed. Therefore, she described in detail her experience of missing out on education and her hard work, hoping to be disclosed in the newspaper, expecting the sympathy of the public, and so on. The original text was too long and could not be published, so a brief reply is provided below, Editor's Note.</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Wang, After receiving your letter, we learned that you have devoted yourself to nursing work based on a spirit of universal love, rescuing and protecting soldiers during wartime, and caring for patients groaning in their sickbeds during peacetime. Your work is extremely meaningful, and your spirit is very admirable! We deeply sympathize with your pain of being unable to complete your studies due to your poor family circumstances. The so-called discrimination due to a lack of "qualifications" is, under certain circumstances, inevitable. It is certainly very fulfilling for a person to have both excellent character and genuine knowledge. However, if a young person who has missed out on education and whose circumstances do not allow them to obtain qualifications can aspire to work diligently and persevere in their studies, seeking learning in their work, then, given time, it may well be a path to honing genuine talent and practical skills. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." Although you do not have "qualifications" due to missing out on education, there is really no need to be pessimistic. Let people laugh at you in whispers. We sincerely hope that you will work hard and study hard! Everything is a learning opportunity. We believe that the result of hard work and self-encouragement will "certainly lead to extraordinary achievements." Wishing you progress!</p>
<h3>Explanation of "Tianhu Yuan"</h3>
<p>Reply to reader Zhang Weici</p>
<p>Recently, I read a news item in your newspaper on August 13th, titled "Creating and Destroying Tianhu Yuan," and it stated that the central government periodically destroys it, but it is not explained what "Tianhu Yuan" is. I hope you can provide an explanation. Reader Zhang Weici</p>
<p>[Editor's Reply] The so-called "Tianhu Yuan" originated from farmers on the banks of Dongting Lake in northern Hunan, who, when the lake water recedes each year, embank a portion of the lake area (i.e., Tianhu Yuan) to create fields, causing the lake area to shrink. When the water rises, it cannot be contained and overflows into Hubei Province (due to the terrain). Therefore, people in Hubei firmly demand that Tianhu Yuan be created and destroyed, returning the fields to the lake to avoid harm, while people in Hunan oppose the creation and destruction due to their interests. The dispute has been going on for a long time. However, the central government, in order to take into account all considerations, has decided to create and destroy it.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Answers</h3>
<p>[Question from Xu Ping, Hangzhou] How does a "facsimile machine" transmit true-copy telegrams?</p>
<p>A facsimile machine uses photoelectric phenomena to transmit telegrams. The main transmitting equipment includes a rotating cylinder, guide screw, synchronous motor, light source, lens, plane mirror, and phototube. The receiving side includes a rotating cylinder, guide screw, synchronous motor, and tracing needle. The transmitting function is to divide the original text into lines and dots, convert them into electrical current by the phototube, and then send them to the other party through wireless or wired circuits. The receiving side amplifies the received current and then uses the tracing needle, driven by the synchronous motor, to generate a corona on a specially prepared receiving paper, reproducing text that is exactly the same as the original. This is the general working principle of a facsimile machine for true-copy telegrams.</p>
<p>[Question from Lu Jun, Zhabei Water and Electricity Road] (Omitted)</p>
<p>Our bureau's repair of telephone user faults is based on user reports or daily routine tests. The repair room issues a work order and sends a repairman. The repairman holds a work order when going out for repairs. If the same fault occurs again within a specified period after the repair, our bureau has penalties, and the repairman will be punished. If the user's line experiences a fault in the future and there are suspicions of "artificial damage" as mentioned in the letter, the user can report the fault occurrence and the date of each repair to our bureau, and we will conduct a thorough investigation. Our bureau highly welcomes users' good intentions in assisting in exposing malpractices. Our bureau has always prohibited employees from soliciting bribes. However, it also relies on the cooperation of users. If there are incidents of solicitation, please report them in detail, and we will strictly crack down on them. As for the suggestion to handle the transfer procedures, according to Article 8 of the revised "Measures for Limiting Urban Telephones" promulgated by the Ministry of Communications, "Transfer is only allowed two years after the installation of the machine. If the transfer is done privately within two years, resulting in inconsistency between name and reality, the phone will be suspended and the machine dismantled once discovered by the authorities." Those who meet the above regulations can apply for verification.</p>

<h3>Flowers and Children</h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>In the early morning, I just got out of bed and stood on the lawn in front of the door.</p>
<p>Some flowers and trees grow around the lawn. Many flowers are in bloom. White, red, yellow, purple… fully bloomed, half-bloomed, budding… the petals are all covered with overnight dew, shimmering like pearls under the sunlight.</p>
<p>A breeze blew by. The flowers swayed on the branches, as if nodding to me, as if smiling and saying to me: "Good morning"!</p>
<p>——Good morning! May you all be well! I also smiled unconsciously and answered them in my heart.</p>
<p>Not long after a burst of urgent ringing, a group of children, still rubbing their sleepy eyes, ran out of the house to the lawn.</p>
<p>They were jumping and skipping, like calves or lambs that had just been released from the pen.</p>
<p>They were busy playing seesaw, riding wooden horses… They were laughing and making noise, like a large group of sparrows chirping incessantly.</p>
<p>At this moment, I suddenly felt very keenly, realized: Children are also flowers, flowers of humanity!</p>
<p>Isn't that so? ——The relationship between us adults and children is like the relationship between branches and flowers! Flowers decorate the branches, continue the branches, enrich the branches, bring the future and hope to the branches… Similarly, children also decorate our lives, continue our lives, enrich our interests, bring us the future and hope…</p>
<p>Moreover, our little flowers are more beautiful, more lively, and more lovely than all of them.</p>
<p>Isn't that so! ——Ours can jump and make noise, while theirs are always silently and rarely moving; ours can speak, laugh, and sing, while theirs are always silent…</p>
<p>While I was standing and contemplating, the children had already run to my side and discovered my existence; they immediately cheered as usual: "Good morning! Uncle × good morning"!</p>
<p>So, I picked up the smallest one among them, named Zuo Zuo, and held him up as their representative, kissed their apple-like rosy and full cheeks, and then also replied loudly:</p>
<p>"Good morning! Children, no, little flowers, good morning! May you all be well! May you all grow stronger, more beautiful, and more fragrant than those flowers! Our tomorrow, our career, everything of ours, is completely entrusted to you!"</p>
<p>(1947, mid-summer, in Shanghai)</p>
<h3>Knowing the Warmth and Coldness Oneself; One of the Rambling Talks During a Busy Schedule</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Li Changji, with his long eyebrows and long fingernails, has a line that says: "I don't believe that year after year on the Liaohai Sea, where does literature cry in the autumn wind?" These short fourteen characters have revealed the loneliness of literati who know their own sweetness and bitterness. Although "Autumn tombs ghost sing the poetry of the Bao family" is eerily scary, Changji's wandering life is actually the same as that which Qu Dafu entrusted to the "Mountain Ghost." Using objects for satire is also an example of knowing the warmth and coldness oneself.</p>
<p>Ancient and modern poets do not seek to follow the fashion when writing, so the situation of knowing the warmth and coldness oneself is deeper and greater. When the literary movement of the Six Dynasties was popular, Chen Ziang began to sigh, "In front, I do not see the ancients, behind, I do not see the successors..." He is not sighing that he cannot see the ancients, but rather sighing that "I regret that I was born too late to love the ancients." The predecessors have passed away, and there is no one to continue. Although I have the will, I am not known to anyone… Is this Chen Ziang's sorrowful and bleak heart that knows the warmth and coldness himself? And Li Qingyun's "The Great Elegant has not been composed for a long time, who will present my decline?" and Du Shiyi said, "Read ten thousand volumes of books, and the pen writes as if divinely guided." "Words that do not startle people will never rest," on the one hand, it is enough to show the deep and great achievements of the predecessors, and on the other hand, it is also enough to show the feeling of knowing the sweetness and bitterness of the warmth and coldness.</p>
<p>Yuan Zheng's inscription on Du Zimei's tombstone said, "Since poets, there has been no one like Zimei." This sentence can be said to be extremely pertinent. If Du Gongbu did not know the warmth and coldness himself, then the six quatrains on poetry could not have been written, with the line "There is no doubt about the former sages." This statement is indeed a humble one, but it is also enough to see the source of Gongbu's great achievements. And "Wang Yang Lu Luo was the style of the time, and frivolous writing was ridiculed without end; your bodies and names will perish together, but the Yangtze River will flow forever." Shouldering great responsibilities, one cannot speak of it unless one is absolutely able to know the warmth and coldness oneself. The source of frivolous contemporary writing still follows the Six Dynasties. If the true stream of poetry does not perish, then Wang Yang Lu Luo will certainly not be recited for thousands of years. Although Wang Yang Lu Luo are praised as the Four Great Talents of the early Tang Dynasty, when comparing their poetry with that of Li Du, it still feels delicate and weak. Du Fu was not a frivolous youth. With his feelings for Li Bai, which have not changed for decades, we can know that his difficulty with Wang Yang and others actually comes from the standpoint of artistic appreciation. His "Literature hates those who are successful" is originally an appeal for Li Bai, and at the same time, it is a resonance of knowing the sweetness and bitterness oneself. Especially when viewed with the two sentences "Do not despise modern people who love ancient people, clear words and beautiful sentences must be neighbors," we can know that what he despised in Wang Yang and others is that their poetry and prose still derived from the Six Dynasties; what he loved in the ancients is that their words and atmosphere were heavy and substantial. And Du Fu's love and hate were not about "people," but determined by "poetry." Therefore, he was particularly fond of Li Bai, because his clear words and beautiful sentences were lovely, and he must seek to be his neighbor with virtue. His self-knowledge and knowledge of others are also unique to poets throughout the ages. It is not like today's poets, who form factions and attack dissidents. It can be deeply felt when speaking of it.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo's poem "Spring River Water Warm, Ducks Know First" is said to be about ducks, but it is actually about people. He identified those who did their best as "disciples who overturned the style of China," not only because of their "thick soil, deep water, and heavy words," and "but opening the style and not being a teacher," but also because their poetic style was high and ancient, clear and strange, and could possess grief, supervision, heroism in one furnace. Ducks know the warmth of the water first, because they have not left the water. Poets must also know the sweetness and bitterness of the good and bad of poetry. If they do not often cherish the heart of "fearing to become the dust of Qi and Liang," and even as Mr. Zhu Xiang said: "Using poetry as a stepping stone to advancement, and waiting until they have officials and money, they will no longer write poetry." (The general meaning is like this, see "Collection of Letters"), like this kind of strange rhyme of "presenting a letter to a certain Ministry of Works," and "being in the mountains and forests, but with the heart in the imperial court," randomly composing in even and uneven tones will eventually lead to the destruction of both body and name. The only treatment for this kind of poet is to read the collection of Zheng Banqiao, so that they can slightly dispel their absurd thoughts.</p>
<p>Meng Haoran was known to the world for his ability to chant, but he did not know the bitterness of the world's warmth and coldness. His response was not with the poem "The lake is level in August," but with "The incapable are abandoned by the enlightened ruler, and the many illnesses cause the old friends to be estranged." No wonder he ended up with the sentence "It is not I who abandoned you, but you who abandoned me," and eventually died in seclusion in the forest springs. The two sentences of "incapable" are a complaint when the bitterness is expressed to others. The matter of complaining cannot be done by the foolish, nor should it be done by the wise. In the past, Su Dongpo was demoted for his washing-baby poem, which is also an example of "I have been misled by cleverness all my life." Birds lose their lives because of their colorful feathers, so one must be careful!</p>
<p>Jia Yi, who said, "An owl gathers in the house, the master will leave," could not know the warmth and coldness himself, and forced himself to be clever. He found it difficult to deal with the affairs of the common people and ghosts and gods, and eventually ended up being transferred to Changsha and dying in depression.</p>
<p>Therefore, "warmth and coldness" contain some "sweetness and bitterness." If you do not see it clearly yourself, you will only damage this path. In this time and in this world, writing three or two articles does nothing to supplement the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is not urgent for the tears of the common people, it is really better to burn the manuscript and bury the flowers, and listen to the ghosts singing in the autumn tombs at night.</p>
<h3>Memories of Western Hills</h3>
<p>— Feng Li</p>
<p>On a hot summer night, there was no breeze, and the leaves were still as if they had fallen asleep. My heart was anxious and I had no sleepiness at all. The thoughts of my mind gradually drifted away, and I thought of the Western Hills of Peiping. It was the first time in my life that I had gone to escape the summer heat, and it was the only time. Ever since I came back from that summer retreat, I began to taste the troubles of life—I began to study, which is a trouble that children cannot escape. After that, the various troubles that my age brought me followed. I, who was stimulated by twenty years of troubles, could no longer bear to look back on the happiness of the past.</p>
<p>Lazily leaning on a rattan chair, silently gazing at the horizon, I hoped to find a shooting star among the stars.</p>
<p>A little phosphorescence flew under the dark shadows of the trees. I suspected it was a fallen shooting star. It seemed to be a little spiritual rhinoceros horn, illuminating my childhood memories.</p>
<p>I remember it was the summer of my fifth year. My maternal grandmother and mother took my cousins and me to the Western Hills to escape the summer heat. We rented two rooms in Biyun Temple. Our neighbors were three university students. Mr. Lin was the most lively of them. He liked to tease me the most. His liveliness and naughtiness stimulated my young mind.</p>
<p>They often took us donkey riding, and it was always Mr. Lin who took me. Stepping on the wildflowers covered with dew, a burst of the donkey's copper bell rang loudly. Our donkey took the lead, and his classmates and my cousins all fell behind. A light breeze blew through my loose hair, brushing against his chest. I couldn't help turning my face and smiling at him.</p>
<p>The spring water in the Western Hills was very sweet. Mr. Lin held the spring water in his hands for me to drink. That sweet spring was a great comfort to travelers, but at that time, I had only traveled such a short journey!</p>
<p>In the evening, the cool breeze was blowing, and in the bushes outside Biyun Temple, there was a sea of phosphorescence, like the stars tonight. I burrowed into the bushes to catch the fireflies, and several times I wanted to put them together in my palm, but before I could get close, they had drifted away gently like ghost fires. At this time, Mr. Lin brought a gauze bag, full of fireflies, and slowly walked to my side. Then my heart blossomed like this group of fireflies.</p>
<p>But happiness is short-lived, like a shooting star sliding across the sky, only a momentary flash of light, shining in my life.</p>
<h3>Juniet's Cart</h3>
<p>— Rousseau</p>
<p>Rousseau (Henri Rousseau, 1841-1910) was a man of little education. He served in the military, participated in the Franco-Prussian War, and also worked as a customs officer. He did not learn to paint from a teacher, but simply described himself like a child. Soon, he suddenly jumped to become a painter. However, he never joined the ranks of professional painters, and rarely appeared in public until he participated in the "Independent Art Exhibition" in 1886, when he began to attract attention.</p>
<p>His work is simple and unadorned, innocent and archaic, neither imitating the ancients nor imitating the contemporary, and without any scientific knowledge. He only describes according to the illusions in his eyes, becoming an absolutely subjective expression. He is one of the four great vajras of the Post-Impressionist school.</p>
<p>This work is owned by P. Rosenberg. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Frog Song</h3>
<p>— Li Yixun</p>
<p>After a vacant lot outside the wall was just converted into a small garden, I heard frog songs every night. So, in addition to the barking of dogs and the monotonous sound of the night watchman's clapper, summer nights added another kind of music.</p>
<p>On the first night, I didn't know where they were calling from, and I went to look for them in the moonlight, but I only heard the sound coming from a patch of shallow grass, and I still couldn't see their traces. I stood and listened for a long time, and I was really a little surprised that these flat, wide mouths were chattering non-stop. What did it mean: singing? Dialogue? Or cursing? Or, just calling for the sake of calling, nothing at all.</p>
<p>In Lu Xun's "Comedy of Ducks," he mentioned that the Russian blind poet Eroshchenko was concerned about why there were no frog songs in Beijing as soon as he arrived in Beijing, as if he was unbearably lonely. In fact, I think it's not because this blind poet has any special preference for frog songs, but because he is blind and sees nothing; when he first arrived in Beijing, it was during a hot summer night, and in a monotonous circle of life without any sound, even frog songs seemed to be a wonderful kind of music.</p>
<p>But if you get used to this music that never changes except for "ge ge ge", you will also feel monotonous and tasteless, and even think that this sound is simply superfluous, and only destroys the loneliness of summer nights.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 382</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Speaking of "Dunjia" (遁甲, a metaphysical system), many people with excessive imaginations will again force associations with mystical and incredible magic. In fact, according to the new explanation, it's just a kind of "camouflage" in the deployment of positions. With camouflage, you can deceive the enemy's eyes and ears, and as a result, I can avoid bad luck and seek good fortune.</p>
<p>The old stockade's method of camouflage is extremely simple; it merely sets up several devices to lead people to other small roads, preventing them from reaching the road into the canyon. After the Japanese occupied Shenyang, there were indeed several armed exploration teams that came to the old stockade; however, after exploring twenty or thirty *li* beyond the canyon, they were blocked by a stretch of treacherous forest. At the edge of the treacherous forest, there were only a few dilapidated thatched huts, inhabited by some poor hunters, which they deemed unworthy of deeper investigation. Fortunately, each time Lord Long conducted guerrilla warfare, it was two or three hundred *li* away. After the attacks, the main force had already left; only a few hidden sentry lines remained, leading the enemy search parties into the remote mountains and treacherous forests, letting them see gods and ghosts. They never imagined that these poor hunters surrounding the old stockade had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>The several routes leading in and out of the old stockade all had secret agents dispatched, directly reaching Shenyang. In Shenyang City, there was also a precise network of informants; therefore, the old stockade understood the dynamics of Shenyang like the back of its hand. Since the Republic of China's restoration, only one person knew the situation of the old stockade: the captain of Zhang Zuolin's special detective team, a naturalized Italian. He had good eyesight and learning, and his actions were very much in line with the chivalrous path. Only then did Lord Long come into contact with him. After the September 18th Incident, he resigned from his post. The Japanese side did not allow it but instead placed his wife and daughters under surveillance, wanting to use him to guide routes to "annihilate" the righteous people's corps, volunteer army, Red Spears Society, White Way Society, and various stockade "anti-Japanese" groups, etc. How could they restrain him with this clumsy method?</p>
<p>Tsurumi was a thoughtful person with keen eyes, so he came into contact with this person. It was Tsurumi who introduced him to Lord Long. … However, while there was contact, Lord Long never allowed them to visit the old stockade. This wasn't because Lord Long lacked friendship; it was simply that these two people's actions attracted too much attention. For the sake of the old stockade's safety, only implementing this "isolation" method could be considered appropriate. The two men were quite understanding.</p>
<p>Later, Tsurumi introduced Yaoqun to learn the truth from this detective team leader. After his death, seeing that Yaoqun had no prospects, and wanting her to gain some practical experience, he introduced her to Lord Long to stay as a guest in the old stockade. Before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese aggression against China was increasingly urgent. Yaoqun felt that this kind of passive waiting, occasionally fighting guerrillas, could not compensate for the overall situation, nor could it fully display her talents. Only then did she tell Lord Long that she wanted to enter the pass to seek opportunities and do some work for the country. Lord Long originally had this idea, so he greatly agreed and also expressed that if there was a suitable opportunity in the future, he himself would also be willing to enter the pass and serve the country loyally. Immediately, he personally ran to Shenyang, sent a secret telegram, and informed Zhang Jinlong, the old stockade's business representative stationed in Peiping, to properly receive Yaoqun and suggested that Yaoqun select a few male and female strong people to bring with her to use.</p>
<p>Yaoqun pondered for a while and politely declined Lord Long's suggestion: She thought that her future was still a blur, how could she make such arrangements. She would wait until she had made progress before considering it. Lord Long had no choice but to drop the suggestion. He only instructed Yaoqun that if she encountered any trouble, Zhang Jinlong was quite resourceful and could be asked to help. After discussing and deciding, Yaoqun then prepared her travel arrangements and set off alone.</p>
<p>Who knew that the day Yaoqun entered the station, even though she was so meticulous and clever, she was pushed in the crowd, and somehow, her handbag was opened. When she went to get money to buy a ticket, she realized that the clothes in the bag were still there, but only her purse was missing. Just as she was feeling distressed and amused, she heard a child's voice behind her calling "Aunt Ji..." After spending endless effort and countless words, she had finally gotten rid of the little tiger, but she hadn't expected him to still secretly chase after her.</p>
<h3>Remotely Pointing at the Milky Way to Discuss "Qixi"</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>"Qixi" (七夕, the Double Seventh Festival) and "Qiqiao" (乞巧, begging for skills) can evoke many beautiful reveries in us: this legendary "festival" gives the ancient, leisurely Chinese sons and daughters a lot of warmth. But today, who has the mood to beg for skills from the Milky Way? Who has the leisure to kneel down to the double stars crossing the river and pray for blessings?</p>
<p>Prices are like thorns, making you restless day and night; after the exchange rate was recognized, the cigarette industry rose by 30%; gasoline doubled; private universities charge 2 million per semester; public utilities are also clamoring to adjust prices. These things, those things, make today's sons and daughters, what mood do they have to peep at the "Cowherd" and "Weaver Girl's" meeting in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Look, Japanese goods are immediately pouring into Chinese ports; after suffering eight years of hardship, enduring the long-term humiliation of Japanese bandits, those cheap goods from before the war are again displayed before your eyes. According to general purchasing power, everyone should like Japanese goods, because they are cheap and exquisite; but emotionally speaking, this hatred hasn't been eliminated, yet it comes to your door putting on a "flattering smile." Do you buy it or not?</p>
<p>It is said that 15,000 Japanese alarm clocks have arrived in Hong Kong, and their ringing cannot awaken the confusion of Chinese sons and daughters!</p>
<p>To return to the ancient mood of seeking blessings under the Qixi Milky Way, in today's view, it is somewhat ironic, isn't it?</p>
<p>Perhaps tonight, this evening, there will still be the embellishments of congratulating "Qixi", but every parent, they are either calculating the rise in rice and oil, or they are shivering for their children's education expenses. Although the Milky Way is still there, who has the mood to beg for skills from the Milky Way cloud magpies?</p>

<h3>Orders of the Seventh Month</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ruo</p>
<p>A few days before the Start of Autumn, a light rain urges coolness, as if it were early autumn. Therefore, there is a saying, "Ten days in advance, it's autumn." Li Fu thus composed a poem: "The green shade of parasol trees fills the courtyard, inviting the new coolness to the pillow's edge. A few gusts of light rain and slanting wind pass by, ten days in advance, it's autumn."</p>
<p>Thunder on the Start of Autumn indicates that the rice ears will not be full. There is a saying, "Autumn grain is stony, harvest empty grain." Also, when the rice ears are in bloom, a thick fog arises, with a white rainbow traversing it, commonly called "Baiqi," it also indicates a harvest of empty grain, called "heaven's harvest." Cai Yun's *Wu Yu* says: "Rain sprinkles and wind blows, the sun is clear again, ten days before autumn, the sounds of autumn begin. Snow melons and fire wine are nearly refreshingly new, afraid to hear the jade tiger鳴 (meaning thunder)鸣鳴鳴 in the sky."</p>
<p>According to local custom, the morning and night of the Start of Autumn are used to predict coolness and heat. There is a saying, "Autumn begins in the morning, *sou sou* (onomatopoeia for cool wind), autumn begins at night, hot *pan pan* (onomatopoeia for hot)." After morning, there may still be times when it is unbearably hot, which is called "autumn tiger."</p>
<p>On the Qixi Festival, the market is already selling clever sweets. Some accompany flowers and fruits, placing incense and candles in the courtyard, or on the terrace, to worship the double stars to beg for skills. Cai Yun's *Wu Yu* says: "How many female companions worship in the front courtyard, joyfully speaking of the magpies building a bridge across the Milky Way. Clever sweets fill the plate, and the young ladies gorge themselves, begging every year from the double stars."</p>
<p>On the evening of the seventh day before, take a cup and fill it with "Mandarin Duck Water", scoop it and mix it with dew in the courtyard. Expose it to the sun the next day, slowly wait for a membrane to form on the surface of the water, then each take a small needle and toss it to make it float. Then look at the shadow of the needle at the bottom of the water to verify intelligence or clumsiness, which is called begging for skills. Wu Manyun's Preface to *Jiang Xiang Festival Items* says that it is right to thread needles to return to custom, and those who rely on it call it "needle shadow." The poem says: "Threading needles every year, we make appointments with neighbors, further using the remaining skills to kill the needle god. Alone at home, I see the shadow of the dragon shuttle, continuing the Mandarin Ducks that do not cross people."</p>
<p>After Qixi, observe the brightness and darkness of the Milky Way to predict the rise and fall of rice prices, saying that darkness indicates expensive rice, brightness indicates cheap rice. Gu Tieqing's poem says: "The color of the waning moon reflects the Former Han, the quiet night Milky Bay looks low in one sweep. Wanting to predict the new rice price in the coming autumn, the Heavenly Granddaughter marries far away in Hexi." At this time, the farmers have just finished plowing, and each collect money to offer sacrifices to the god of fierce generals, carrying the god to the field, slaughtering livestock and setting up offerings, with drums and music to thank him. It is said that if this is done, locusts will not be a disaster, which is called burning green seedlings.</p>
<p>The Hungry Ghost Festival, commonly known as the Seventh Month Half. People, regardless of rich or poor, all worship their ancestors. Wu Zimu's *Meng Liang Lu* says: "On the Hungry Ghost Festival, sacrifices to ancestors use hemp grain nests, implying the intention of reporting the autumn harvest in advance." It also says: "Those who have the means set up ancestral halls in their homes to mourn." On this day, farmers worship the god of the fields, each with rice dumplings, chicken, millet, melon, and vegetable offerings at the crossroads of the fields, bowing twice and offering blessings, which is called Zhai Tiantou (斋田頭, fasting the field head).</p>
<p>Those who are fond of such things collect money and form associations, gather monks, set up altars for rites and chanting sutras, capture lonely souls, judge *hu* (斛, a unit of volume) and distribute food, release *Yan Kou* (flaming mouths, spirits suffering from starvation), burn a stack of paper money, beat gongs, and mix in [omission], burning in the streets and corners of the city, called [omission]. *Yi Shi Yao* (绎氏要), *Meng Lan* (孟兰), a 天竺 (India) term, is like saying upside down, an emergency rescue device. Thus, it has been passed down as a Buddhist saying. Also, on the night of the Hungry Ghost Festival, lanterns are released along the river, called illuminating the dark. Wu Manyun's Preface to *Jiang Xiang Festival Items* says: "The custom is to cut paper into lanterns like lotuses, and burn them, saying that it illuminates the suffering of the underworld, but this is done on the last day of the seventh month, not on the Hungry Ghost Festival."</p>
<p>On the twentieth day, according to popular tradition, it is the birthday of cotton, and rain is taboo. There is a saying: "If it rains on the twentieth day of the seventh month, the cotton will not go to the store."</p>
<p>The thirtieth day is the birthday of Dizang Wang (地藏王, Ksitigarbha), and there is a custom for women to take off their skirts. The skirts are made of red paper, and it is said that for every birth, a skirt is taken off once, so that in the next life they can avoid the hardship of childbirth. At dusk, every household puts incense and candles on the steps of the courtyard. There are also those who use lotus lanterns and burn dog excretion incense to make offerings. Jiang Yuanxi's poem says: "The golden immortal转劫降東瀛 (transmigrates to the east), the teaching master comes from the day of the full moon. A little Zen lamp is divided into real flames, and all the darkness is illuminated."</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on the Double Seventh Festival</h3>
<p>— Shufeng</p>
<p>The scorching heat of *Xunnan* has passed, and in an instant, it will be the season of "yellow leaves dancing in the autumn wind." Gazing up at the Milky Way at night, facing the twinkling stars, I am stirred by boundless deep feelings.</p>
<p>According to *Shi Wu Ji Yuan* (事物紀原, Records of the Origins of Things): "King Huai of Chu first established the Double Seventh Festival." Judging from this sentence, it can be known that the origin of the Double Seventh Festival has a splendid and long history of thousands of years. The myth of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's "meeting on the magpie bridge" has also been widely circulated as early as before the Li Tang Dynasty. As for calling the Double Seventh Festival the "Daughters' Festival," it is not without basis, because in ancient times, women were everywhere restricted by rituals and had few opportunities to freely revel all day long. Only on this day of the Double Seventh Festival could they do so. The sentence in "The Peacock Flies Southeast" says, "On the seventh and ninth days of the first lunar month, let us play and frolic and not forget each other." The seventh day refers to the Double Seventh Festival, which says that the Double Seventh Festival was the festival of revelry for women in ancient times. Therefore, the ancients fabricated the story of the "heavenly match." It was not only for embellishment but also had its factors and significance.</p>
<p>Although the Double Seventh Festival refers to the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, before the Song Dynasty, the sixth day of the seventh lunar month was also regarded as the Double Seventh Festival. According to [omission], the "begging for skills" day of the people in the capital at that time was entirely because of the different left and right compartments, such as taking the sixth and seventh days as the Double Seventh Festival. It was not until the third year of the *Taiping Xingguo* reign (978 CE) that Emperor Taizong of Song issued an edict to determine the seventh day of the seventh lunar month as the Double Seventh Festival. The edict said: "The Double Seventh auspicious day, written in the order, the current customs mostly use the sixth day, which is not the old system, it should be restored to using the seventh day." In order to "should be restored to using the seventh day," the imperial court even specially issued an edict to establish it. This shows how popular the trend of taking the sixth day of the seventh lunar month as the Double Seventh Festival must have been at the time. However, this trend has not been seen in Tang people's books, so it may have originated in the Five Dynasties period.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone will think of the legendary story of Emperor Ming of Tang's visit to the Moon Palace, but few know that Emperor Ming of Tang's relationship with the Double Seventh Festival is truly intimate. *Kaiyuan Tianbao Remains* records: "Emperor Ming and Consort Yang had a banquet on the Double Seventh Festival in the Huaqing Palace, arranged wine and fruits in the courtyard, sought favor from the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars, and each caught spiders in small boxes. At dawn, they used the density of the silk webs as a sign of skill. Even today, men and women imitate them." And the *Song of Everlasting Regret* states: "In the seventh month of autumn, on the evening of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's meeting, the customs of the people of Qin were that on this night, they displayed embroidered fabrics, arranged food and drink, planted melons and fruits, and burned incense in the courtyard, called begging for skills. It was especially popular in the palace." I can't help but secretly sigh for Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, who, even in the midst of military affairs, still had such elegant interests. Looking back at the present, every time the Double Seventh Festival comes, in addition to a few theaters routinely staging a few performances of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's heavenly match as an embellishment, it is the seasonal fruits and foods supplied by food stores once a year. There is no other Double Seventh Festival atmosphere. It just points out that the folk people no longer have the interest in begging for skills that the ancients had.</p>
<h3>Double Seventh Festival Research</h3>
<p>— Xu Ren</p>
<p>The Cowherd and Weaver Girl double stars cross the Milky Way on the night of the seventh day of the seventh lunar month for their annual reunion. This myth began in the Han Dynasty. Ying Shao of the Eastern Han Dynasty said: "The Weaver Girl crosses the river on the Double Seventh Festival, and magpies form a bridge." This is the earliest record of the Double Seventh Festival.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Han Dynasty, on the evening of the Double Seventh Festival, wine and meat were set up to [omission] the stars, and people stayed up until late at night without sleeping. If they saw a kind of glory appearing in the sky [omission] the double stars crossing the river.</p>
<p>In the Jin Dynasty, the customs of the Double Seventh Festival were also to set up wine, meat, fruits, and cakes, scatter incense powder on the table, and pray to the stars for wealth, longevity, or to be blessed with sons, but only one could be requested, not more.</p>
<p>In the Six Dynasties, in addition to offering melons and fruits, women used colored threads to thread seven-hole needles. The needles were made of gold and silver. The meaning of threading the needles was to ask the Weaver Girl to grant them skillful skills in needlework. If a spider's web was found on a melon or fruit that night, it was considered a sign that the request had been granted. This threading of needles is the origin of what the world calls "begging for skills." The reason why the Double Seventh Festival is also called the Begging for Skills Festival is due to this.</p>
<p>Emperor Ming of Tang, the amorous emperor of the Tang Dynasty, attached great importance to the Double Seventh Festival. Every year on the night of the Double Seventh Festival, he and Yang Guifei (Consort Yang) held a grand banquet in the Huaqing Palace to enjoy music. Bai Juyi's *Song of Everlasting Regret* says that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Taizhen "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, in the middle of the night, no one was there to whisper." It is indeed a factual record.</p>
<p>By the Song Dynasty, the patterns were even more distinctive and novel. *Meng Hua Lu*, written by a Song person, says: "On the Double Seventh Festival, soil is laid on a small board, and millet is planted to make seedlings grow. Small thatched houses, flowers, and trees are placed, and small figures of farmhouses are made, all in the state of villages, called grain board. Various patterns are carved on melons, called flower melons. Smiling faces are made of oily dough, sugar, and honey, called fruits and foods, with ingenious and varied patterns. Also, tea, beans, small beans, and wheat are soaked in water in porcelain containers, growing several inches, and tied with red and blue silk, called planting life. 彩模 (Color molds) are set up in the street center to sell goods."</p>
<h3>Cactus Flower</h3>
<p>— Photo presented by Gong Xinyuan</p>
<p>This "Cactus Flower" photo is clear and lovely. The shape of the flower is unusually similar to what is generally called Epiphyllum (昙花, a type of flower), which is sufficient to prove that the so-called "Epiphyllum" is indeed a cactus family plant, and is specially published here to remove all mysterious atmospheres about Epiphyllum. According to the cactus family, there are a total of 20 genera and 1,500 species. "Cactus ball" and the commonly called "Epiphyllum" are two plants of the same family but different genera. Cactus ball is a plant of the "Cactus ball genus", and the genus and species names of Epiphyllum have not yet been determined, or it is said that it should belong to the "Leaf Cactus genus", but it is not yet certain.</p>
