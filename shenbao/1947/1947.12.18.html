<h3>魏德邁促加緊援華在參院撥款會陳述意見杜魯門簽署緊急援歐案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播，華盛頓訊，魏德邁將軍十七日在參院撥款委員會陳述意見，認爲蔣主席係「今日中國之合理的領袖」，促請美國加緊援華，不應有所偏廢，並望中國能對此項援助作有效之使用。魏氏稱：「蔣氏爲仁慈之專政者，抑爲民主之領袖，余認爲並無關係。最重要之一點，即係渠始終反對共產黨」。渠復謂：蔣氏在太平洋戰爭到達高潮時，可能按照「極有利之條件」與日本締和，其結果可使日本調遣「軍隊一百五十萬人與美國人作戰」，但蔣氏「始終對盟邦恪守信義，其人格之高超，至堪欽佩」。當詢以美國應否立即以軍用供應品及經濟援助予中國時，魏氏力言「余認爲應該」。渠稱：蔣氏「需耍並值得援助」。蔣氏始終恪守與我國所訂之協定，茍余爲蔣氏，餘將對美國極感不耐矣。魏氏認爲，美國堆積在太平洋各地之剩餘軍用供應品，對中國不適用，因中國所需者爲輕武器，渠告委員會謂：渠在離開中國之前，蔣氏曾向渠保證兩點：　中國將繼續反對共產主義，　將設法建立民主政治，惟謂民主政治之能否建立，胥視蘇聯之態度，美國之態度以及經濟能否穩定而定。魏氏拒絕說明訪華報告書之內容，因總統命其保守秘密，茍委員會迫其說明詳細內容，將使渠處於「窘境」。魏氏在其演說中雖未直接指出蘇聯之名，但謂美國在世界各地正面對一反對之思想勢力。美國必須阻止此種勢力之擴張，然後重入受此種勢力影響之地區。　　〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統十七日簽署五億九千七百萬美元之緊急援歐救濟法案，並未舉行儀式。總統料將於十八日下午舉行記者招待會時，有所說明。又據悉：杜魯門擬於星期五向國會提出長期援歐計劃。</p>
<h3>美衆際撥款會決定暫不撥付援華基金</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十六日電〕美眾院撥款委員會十六日向眾院提出一項法案，該案將自國會所批准之緊急援外案總數中，削去八千八百萬美元，並將援華基金暫不撥付，該案並建議美陸軍維持佔領區之經費謂求削去二億六千萬美元，該委員會提出一項補充之撥款案，其內容如下：</p>
<p>親定五億九千萬美元，供緊急援外用，此數較之十五日批准法，義·奧·中之救濟基金，少去百分之十五。</p>
<p>陸軍請求供救濟以及德·日·朝鮮及奧國等地軍政府經費之四億九千萬美元，祗規定二億三千萬美元，减少百分之五十三。眾院撥款委員會主席泰柏爾稱：該委會在撥款中之所以不爲中國規定款項者，因在國務卿馬歇爾提出計劃前，該項基金並不動用也。該委員會之報告中，引證共和黨眾議員周以德之言謂：「須特馬歇爾提出計劃，予不信撥款委負會對中國撥款負有責任，事實上亦不應有此項撥款之產生」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕眾院撥款委負會削减對外援助經費案，現已送交眾院覆核，眾院民主黨議員立即表示反對，企圖恢復原數。縱令眾院核准削减之數並剔除中國，參院方面或將予以增加，並重新列入中國，以待參眾兩院聯席會議最後決定折衷辦法。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕美眾院撥款委員會，今日將臨時援助案中之援華部份取消，以待政府提出關於更爲確切之援華辦法。據撥款委員會稱：今日臨時援助案中所减去之八千八百萬美元，應保留給予中國或其他批准之計劃。</p>
<h3>援華及對日和會事中美間進行會商顧大使訪美助理國務卿艾摩爾</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十六日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞，十六日趨訪助理國務卿艾摩爾，討論美國，權宜援華計劃及日本和會二事，歷八十分鐘，會後顫氏告記者稱：中國對美國之緊急援助計劃將中國列入，極爲欣慰，並希望援華「將不僅以此權宜援助爲終點」。顧氏此次訪問，乃在渠擭悉眾院撥款委員會將中國自緊急援助各單中削去之前，可能眾院將推翻撥款委員會之意見，恢復原來規定援華之數目。據稱：此次與艾摩爾會晤後，渠感覺美國尚未完成長期援華計劃之詳情。按馬歇爾曾告國會議員稱：此數目將約三億元左右。</p>
<p>顫氏稱：中國仍希望蘇聯及華國能同意中國對日本和會之折衷建議，即由遠東委員會會員國召開日本和會，四强對決議保有否決權，美國對中國之建議迄未答覆，蘇聯對中國最近之建議亦未有新建議提出。顧氏稱：若中國對日本和會程序之折衷建議不能爲蘇聯及美國所接受，則吾人將不得不愼重考慮吾人之立場。記者詢以「如發生上項之情形，中國是否將同意英·美之建議，凡參加對日戰爭之國家皆得參加對日和會，一切決議由三分之二多數制表決，無否決權」？顧氏答稱：此項決議之「結果」將必須考慮之，此一主要結果，勢能遭鴻蘇聯對和會程序之阻撓，中國必須愼審酌量其決議，「蓋吾人與蘇聯乃鄰邦也」。</p>
<h3>駐平蘇領事否認共匪與蘇締盟說</h3>
<p>〔合眾社北平十七日電〕駐北平蘇聯領事鐵維靑斯　十六日夜稱：報章載稱蘇聯已與中國共產黨成立一軍事協定，乃「無稽之談」。</p>
<p>據稱：「吾人現承認中國國民政府爲中國唯一之政府，故此項協定實不可能。」</p>
<h3>中暹間購米協定不受暹政局影響</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕外交部息：中暹購米協定之購米總量，現由中信局草擬核辦中，價款之償付則已定爲英磅·美金各半，最近暹國發生政變，對此項協定並無影響。</p>

<h3>全經委會擬具方案　加强管制花紗布　紡綢會擴組為管制機構</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕據新自美國歸來之某政府官員十七日語本報記者，國人在美之外匯存款，已大量逃避，此爲徴用或申報國人在國外存款遲遲不決之必然結果。據稱：此種逃避已鵝兩次，第一次為美國對外人在美存款解凍時，各存戶因國內曾有徵用之說，故己逃避一批，及至國人在外國之外匯存款申報辦法訂定後，第二批亦繼之逃避，其逃避方式，或爲提取現款，移存他國，或爲委託外籍友人，化名存入，其委託外人存入者甚至支付委託金，而委託金數額竟超過存款息金，故現在美之國人存款已寥寥無幾。</p>

<h3>社論　外長會議的破裂</h3>
<p>四强外長伎義在議在化敦開會十七次後，已於十五日宜吿無定期延會；繼著蘇聯外長莫洛托夫便於日遄返莫斯科，外長會議至此遂不歡而散。此項消息的傳來，不足為要。當此一外長會議於上月廿五日在化敦揭幕的時候，我們就輔導它的前途，未許樂觀，我們又曾指出此次人外長會議的主題為德奧問題：奧國的獨立問題，和對德的和約問題。在對德和約這一個問題上，裏面所包含的還有賠償問題，如何使德國經濟復蘇及德國的政治組織問題。在這外長會議，開於德國的政治組織根本沒有時間討論，就是關於德國經濟的復蘇這一點，也因為賠償問題的僵局未能打開，沒有什麼協議。此次人外長會議的失販，在表面上，至少是以賠償問題的弄僵，而不得不宣吿無定期延會的。提出此一主張的是美國務卿馬歇爾，從而附議的是英外相貝文和法外長皮杜爾。在十五日的最後一次會議席上，馬歇爾曾率直指出，關於德國賠償問題，「僅蘇聯一國堅決拒絕同意，是以繼續舉行會議，亦屬無益。」英外相貝文則於詳述項國之立塲後，指出「歷史將為吾人之證人，吾人今不得不懷疑外長會議最後是否能够解決歐洲及德國問題。」同時，莫洛托夫郤聲稱：「貝文馬歇爾之行動顯然同出一轍，兩人均未遵守議程，且均忽略蘇聯建議，而法國代表團對於英美所言亦從無異議，可見英法已採取一致陣綫，反對對蘇賠償」。又調：「美國代表團來此會議時，並不具有誠意，早已決定使外長會議破裂，而使德國分裂成二部份。」</p>
<p>關於賠償問題，蘇聯要救對蘇賠償額一百億美元，按一九三八年價値計算，若按時値計，當遠一百五十億美元。此據馬歇爾稱則為顯然與波茨坦協定有悖，就實際的經濟原理營，亦為不可能之事。在此等要求之下，祇有同意使德國人民陷於奴役，使整個歐洲之復興遭受嚴重阻撓，始能使四强成立恊議。再就對奧條約言，亦因蘇聯所要求之財產及特權，遠超自由獨立奧國所能腹行之程度。蘇聯始終拒絕供給關於移運德賠償物資之重要且必需的情報，並拒絕同意交出藉賠償為名片面奪取之德財產。蘇聯之手段，使德國無從在復興歐洲之任務中担任其職務；且使英美不得不大量資助德國西部，以維持其生存。不意代表反責英美此等援助為助為企圖利用德西部，作貸反對歐洲民主國及推行擴大政策之戰略基地。這是在這種　見之下，終於使外長會議不得不宣吿無定期延會。當然，戰們　乎無須在此指出，英美所謂西方與蘇聯的歧見，並不在賠償問題上，而是在此賠償更基本的問題上，不過這歧見藉賠償問題而表出罷了。</p>
<p>現在外長會議旣不數而散，宜告無定期延會；何時得能重開，渺不可知。就現有的種種跡象而言，如果外長會議不從此死去，重開似乎也需要一個相當的時間。德國，歐洲，乃至整個世界之分裂為二，趨勢愈顯明；世界前途，益覺動盪。據報傳消息，西方列强現雖不致立即採取行動，但下列各種發展恐將　免：　法國可望同意使其德境佔領區在在經濟上與英美區合併；　英美法三國將及早討論在政治上統一德國西部之可能性，結果或將成立西德國臨時政府。我們前於西强外長會議召開之際，亦以為：「倘使運次四强外長會議對德奧問題，再不能成立協議，則東歐的鐵幕必將放下而成為一種新的長城，所謂兩個界將更有　露的表現。」在回國前，將與英法代表會商，如何採取聯合行動，以應付此後的局面。像這樣對時態勢的繼續發展下去，前途實在可慮。</p>
<p>然而更値得我們注意的不是外長會議的破裂；而是發生在蘇聯及美國各該國本身內的事態。正當外長會議破裂的前夕，蘇聯却突然改革幣制。本來幣的改革原不一定具有什麼題外之義；但此次蘇聯改革幣制所還擇時間，及其內蘊的含義議，也似乎實在不能令人認為對常的改革。從海外傳來的報道，已經指出此次蘇聯的幣制改革在建立盧布集團，以與英磅區域及美元集團對抗，而便於與馬歇爾方案競爭。同時，在美國杜魯門總統所召開的國會特別議，也通過了五億九千七百萬美元的臨時緊急援華法案。關於此一臨時緊急法案，雖還有若干桿關的問題未曾解決；但由於外長會議的失販，耶誔假期後重行集會的國會，必能加强和加速分速完成。</p>
<p>世界的裂跡象，旣愈顯著，身為東方國家的我們，對於此後世界局勢的推移，自然尤感關切。我們於此首先要指出的，便是這不是東方與西方的分裂。我們雖為東方國家，但我們文化傳統向重「天下一家」的觀念，我們決不以位在東方而屬於所謂東方世界，來和西方相對立。我們所要求的是：「天下一家」；如果世界眞有分裂，那實在彌足遺憾。我們願當世的政治家懷於歷史的敎訓，且慢崖勒駡，重敦舊好，，則一時縱有分裂的跡象，終不難尋取彌補和重稪合一的途徑。果能如此，人類能免於將來的刼禍，我們願政治家能發揮出他們的風度來！</p>
<h3>管制紗花布目的</h3>
<p>（上接一版）按棉花·棉布為我國人民主要晶用必需品之一，其重要性僅次於食糧與料，故政府為穏定棉織品之價起見，不得不採取管理行動。實施管理，固將影響民營紡織事業，然為急迫之公衆福利計，此種措施實至合理。</p>
<p>我國人口四億六千萬，對於棉花·棉布之需要量，為數極大如吾人縫製棉衣一件，平均需棉半斤，則全國每年即需棉花二百三十萬担。我國紡織業共有四百五十萬紡錠，其中開工者共三百六十萬　每年共需要棉一千零八十萬担。此外，手織業尙需二百五十萬担，故我國原棉之全年需要量，在一千三百萬担以上。</p>
<p>自勝利以來，政府曾支出鉅額外匯購買外棉。三十五年度本國棉產為七百四十三萬担，輸入外棉墍聯總所購共六百八十萬担，三十六年度棉產較上年度增加百分之五十，預料明年度當能再增，然尙難達到自給自足之程度。</p>
<p>上海紡織事業調節會，為平抑綿織品價格計，曾以官價棉紗供給織廠。過去二年來，各紡織廠獲利頗鉅，而政府則耗去不少外匯，因受投機份子活動之影響，平抑布價未能見效。</p>
<p>按今件二月實行經濟緊急　施後，黃金·外幣之投機賣買，經已明領禁止，且自七月份以來，加增上海交易所證劵經紀人之差額保證金，亦已使證劵與股票方面之長機大見减少，因此上海等大都市之長機份子，巳專注意於商品之囤積居廳。　等挾其大量游資，投機圖利，擾亂社會之安寗，而棉紗·棉布往往領導物價上漲。</p>
<p>基於此種情勢，政府為平抑棉織品價格，顧全大衆福利計，爰決定恢復戰管理花紗布之辦法，以利民用。</p>

<h3>鄧文儀報吿一週戰况　匪凖備明春攻勢　並宣布平漢路兩側匪軍實力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕國防部新聞局局長鄧文儀十七日報吿一週戰况時稱：睽諸上週情勢，可知共匪正凖備明年三月之春季攻勢，因目前天氣漸寒，不宜用兵，而來春天喛，共匪必將大舉也。渠旋答復記者詢問時宜佈平漢路兩側共匪之實力，據稱，劉伯承匪部共六縱隊約七萬八千人，柳林一役匪軍損失萬餘人，現已不足七萬人，在平漢路西側者萬餘，在東側者五萬餘人；陳毅匪部共約八萬人，在蘭封，鄭州，許昌三角地者共六萬人，尙有二萬人在隴海路以北；陳賡部共四萬餘人，接應劉伯承匪部者在柳林五千人，在漯河一萬人。　計平漢以東離海以南，共有十二萬人，該地區國軍實力，鄧氏拒絕宣佈，惟稱，國軍實力强大，數字當在共匪一倍兩倍之間。</p>
<p>鄧氏報吿本月九日至十六日之一週戰局稱：</p>
<p>大別山區極大勝利</p>
<p>大別山區的進剛國軍。巳在戰略上得到極大的勝利，匪首劉伯誠驅迫他的一·二·三·六·十·十二等縱隊七萬餘人，夢　大別山區建立所謂「中原野戰軍根據地」，準備明年過長江以南進擾，受到國軍的圍殱，自本月七日至九日短短兩三天內，殱滅了劉匪的第十縱隊和十二縱　一萬餘人於柳林車站西端，這使劉伯誠不得不盡力　扎，企求使其主力脫離大別山的包　；同時仍以一部在大別山旋磨打圈，戀戀不捨，其三月來苦築的新巢，自十一日起，劉匪以其第十第十二縱隊的大部，曾兩次越過平漢路，走去年李先念的路，向西突個，其一部先後經國軍打擊，又縮回平漢路東側的大新店，錦籠山附近去。</p>
<p>劉匪夢想完全粉碎</p>
<p>劉匪以主力向西無法衝出包圍圈，於是乃改變了逃路的方向，於十四日晚分二股竄經扶北的白雀園附近，及寨河，潢川間，向東北逃竄，目下巳逃到堡子口和杜付店附近，但是沿途都遭國軍的打擊，又死傷了二三千人馬。其逃竄至固始附近的第二縱隊，原想以「大吃小」的戰策，攻擊固始少數的守軍，圖謀報復被國軍逐出大別山區的挫販，然因「國軍戰略戰術應用的巧妙，出於匪軍意料所不及；當柳林車站西方轟轟烈烈隨殲西竄匪軍的時期，更有出其不意的一支生力軍，　尾向匪二縱隊追擊，匪第二縱隊受壓迫和重創後，不得已乃向北竄至三河尖。為營救大別山區中被包圍的匪軍，十一日復自三河尖又向東南竄擾至六安西的楊柳店，又遭國軍環擊，死傷了五百多人，狼狽向東南奔竄中。目下國軍仍在四面圍剿，劉匪建立大別山根據地的夢想快要粉碎了。</p>
<p>豫西之匪虛張聲勢</p>
<p>至於豫西方機的匪軍陳賡部，上週於西峽口遭河南保安團打擊後，接着劉伯誠匪部被包圍於大別山區的消息，使他倉惶之餘，急急派了第九縱隊由伏牛山南釐的方城，向桐柏附近去接應那殘兵販卒的十二縱隊殘部，其另一股五千餘，為營救劉匪突圍，故作虛張聲勢，計十四日曾由方城經明港經明港甄至平漢鐵路漯河附近。</p>
<p>豫東國軍三面攻匪</p>
<p>豫東的匪軍陳毅部，看見大別山匪新根據地的被圍殲，想實行「圍魏救趙」，由魯西凑集八縱隊，於九日越瀧海路南竄，合一·三·四·六等五個縱隊兵力，共八萬人，進出於陳留·尉氏·湖用·長葛·扶溝地區，企圖　攻開封·鄭州，以牽制國軍兵力，减少劉伯誠被包圍的危殆。國軍洞悉其奸，正自東向西，自北向南，自西向東三面包圍攻剿中。</p>
<p>東北匪軍心餘力絀</p>
<p>東北方面，匪軍近又稍有　動，十二月中旬，匪軍第七縱隊自通遼竄至彰武法庫問的山地附近，又匪軍李運昌部的第八縱隊，亦由葉柏壽·凌源地區東竄錦州西方的廿家子·羊山一帶，並破壞錦西西方的北寗鐵路一段；但是奇寒的東北，匪軍心有餘而力不足，此種行動不過是為的補救匪所謂「總反攻」失販後的掩飾而已。</p>

<h3>德西部三佔區合併問題　明春在華府談判　馬歇爾今晨離倫敦返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：華盛頓訊，國務院宣布馬歇爾將於星期五下午十時向全國廣播四强外長會議破裂經過。馬氏預定於星期五晨返國。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：據悉，不久英美法三國可能將在華盛頓舉行會議，會商德國西部佔區之合併問題。皮杜爾對於此項會議顯已表示同意。今晨英外相貝文與皮杜爾會晤，大致係討論德國問題。午刻馬歇爾赴白金漢宮，與英王與后共餐。、</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日雷〕據悉，美法兩國已暫時商定美英法三國外長於明年一月十五日在華盛頓舉行會議，討論德西部組織事宜，惟仍希望與蘇聯合作。據法方消息，美國務卿馬歇爾昨夜與法外長皮杜爾初步接洽，結果滿意。馬歇爾與皮杜爾並約定於啟程返國前，與英外長貝文一談，皮杜爾定於今夜返巴黎。倫數外長會議旣告破裂，關係方面現加緊着重於此後問題，一面擬將德西部配合於馬歇爾計劃，一面仍望蘇聯參加，惟此則須視蘇聯能度。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十七日電〕據此問美官員透露：德西部英美法三佔區之合併問題，尚未能迅速就緒。西方三國對西德經濟或政治之統一問題，尚須有「長期困難之討論。」然對此問題之非正式談判已經開始，而正式談判亦可望於明年初開始。對德國局勢最熟悉之美國人士，對早日成立「三區」德國之點亦不甚樂觀，彼等頗顫及法國輿論予法政府之困難，事實上若干在德國執行美國政策之美官員均主張與法佔區合併事，祇少須俟明春之後。彼等指出法國之參加英美佔區之合併，除能表示西方堅强之團給外，實無其他立即之好處。由於法國恐懼一强大之新德國對其安全之威脅，故法國之參加合併，可能反遷延有助於馬歇爾計劃之經濟進步。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕據消息靈通人士聲稱，馬歇爾昨夜曾向皮杜爾槪述美國對於佔領區合併計劃之大綱，法國參加管理魯爾區，但須以多數表決制爲基礎，不得行使否決權。至於法國要求在萊因流城另設政府一節，美方主張在德國有軍政府存在時期無此必要，目前應予擱置，留待將來討論。</p>
<h3>英政府對德政策　將重行統盤檢討　貝文嚴斥蘇聯攫取德境物資</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕政府要員今日聲稱：英內閣明日或將軍新考慮統盤外交政策，屆時當由貝文外相報告外長會議失敗經過，然後開始討論英國今後應操方針。外長會議破裂結果，引起官方嚴軍關切，英國勢將會同美國促請法國參加德境佔區合併事宜，力謀提高德工業生產，爲歐洲復興而工作。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英外相貝文於外長會議失敗後發表聲明，指責蘇聯已將德國鐵路綫，么用事業及工廠全部拆除，而置入軍事管理之下，以統治德國之經濟生活。除非蘇聯公開此等事實，殊不能以鄭重態度討論賠償問題。貝文估計德境蘇佔區內生產百分之七十，或被不顧波茨坦協定輸往蘇聯，或被蘇聯駐軍所消費。</p>
<p>貝文並聲明，德境英美區合併前後之一切輸出，包括煤斤木材，悉以世界時價折算，而可得外匯，悉以輸入原料盡其他必需品，使德工業經濟得以活動。故莫洛托夫所稱英美籍德國之輸出獲取暴利之說，絕無其事。貝文並曰，英美區當局，願意儘可能迅速拆運最近公布之賠償計劃所列之各工廠，蘇代表團從未能指出彼等係根據波茨坦協定之何款，要求以德生產物作爲賠償。貝文此項聲明，已分交美法蘇代表團。</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十六日電〕美英合併軍政府頃宣稱，廿二處德國戰具工廠，原來規定予以拆除作爲賠償，由於德人之要求，將予以全部保留。</p>

<h3>西德國首都計劃設弗朗克福</h3>

<p>〔中央社紐約十六日電〕哈佛大學建築系主任葛洛庇阿斯今透露，早在四外長倫敦會議昨日宣告破裂前四月，德境美政府總督克萊當主張草擬以弗朗克福爲英美法三佔區所組西部德國之首都計劃。克氏之　求　基于四外長會議將告失敗之假定。</p>
<h3>蘇佔區德人抗議分裂德企圖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播：柏林訊，德國東部之共產黨，今日向四佔領區之政界人士發出通電，對企圖使德國西部經濟合併之計劃，表示抗議，並反對企圖使德國分裂之任何嘗試。德境英美佔區之德國政治人物宣佈組織成立西部德國之草案，謀處德境蘇佔區之共產勢力相抗爭。德境之蘇聯官方報紙認為英美佔區之合併，具有帝國主義性質。</p>

<h3>企圖破壞馬歇爾計劃蘇聯將發動攻勢預料以法國爲主要目標</h3>
<p>〔路透設社巴黎十六日電〕此間法國消息靈通人士相信，外長會議破裂後，蘇聯將發動對馬歇爾方案之攻勢，而將以法國爲主要且標。值得注意者，乃法共現在鄉區發動之宣傳，以破壞財長梅遷之復興計劃。</p>
<p>此等計劃中之要點，包括增加農人捐稅增加轍入以抑低農產品價格等。莫斯科之使東歐集團犧牲戰前對西方之貿易關係，而與蘇聯經濟樹立緊密攻勢，乃其反馬歇爾方案政策之一部。權威方要特別注意最近蘇聯與捷克所訂之貿易協定，使捷克之鋼鐵工業，密切吻合今後五年內蘇聯之需要。消息靈通方面並曰，蘇聯堅，以適應蘇聯之需要，不　捷克本身之一般工業能力，將因此而受影響。例如蘇聯要求捷克供給鋼管十五萬噸，以供蘇聯油業之用。法國在今後數月內將演出物價之自然漲勢，與政府之抑價措施間之競爭，物價自然漲勢之原因，包括冬季之自然缺乏及因工潮而損失之煤斤等。而法共之破壞馬歇爾方案之計劃，預料亦將在此數月內加緊施行。</p>

<h3>法國在挽回狂瀾（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐巴黎通訊員沂若</p>
<p>〔本報巴黎通訊〕十一月十九日的空氣，在法國特別窒息，沉悶，罷工的羣眾更形囂張。</p>
<p>當晚，法國大總統接受了賴馬迪的辭呈後，立刻授意社會黨黨魁雷翁組閣。幸雷翁已開始了一星期的諮詢，交換過一星期的意見，認爲再做一個最後的拉攏，只要把第三種組合所欠的九票拿到，便組　有餘了。經過了三十六小時的努力，於昨日（二十一日）下午，雷翁走進國民大會的會塲，在赫理毆主席之下，對着六百零一位議員，宣佈他的施政方針。一開口，便把反共及反戴高樂的兩重意見表達出來，這兩方面的票數當然無望了；再談到他以爲「是」的經濟政策，模崚得不易捉摸，引起社會急進黨議員們的猜疑；旋述及海外領地問題，他那一向主張對安南和解的態度，不能討右派僅略份子的歡心，無疑地又失去一部份眾數。他向議會要求組閣的信任案，投票結果至深夜十一時揭曉，計反對他的竟有二百七十七票之多，空白票有二十四張，贊成他的僅有三百張整，恰如賴馬迪最後一次所獲的信任票數一般多；賴氏得此還喘延了些時候，但雷翁却因此未能成就好事，因爲根據憲法的規定，「組閣的信任案，須獲議會席數（缺席也算）的絕對多數，即三百〇九票，上了台後，須有絕對的多數反對，才不得留戀，」所以賴氏賴這三百票，仍可繼續維持下去，雷翁爲這三百票，却上不了台。英，美，俄，意諸國的報紙，不知就裹，慌張不安，弄得大驚小怪。</p>
<p>雷翁從此失去個人的權成，社會黨從此失了政府的重心。社會黨秘書長謀勒無精打采地走出議場，他說：大家費了半大氣力。雷翁還是失敗下來，這是雷老自己弄糟了，又怪誰呢？一般輿論認爲社會急進黨對其他的經濟政策不滿，是個主要致命傷，否則棄權的不致有二十四張之多，所差的九張在這事面準可以找得出來。民眾共和黨的議會代言人勒固爾覺得這位社會黨　魁分不出緩急，手法也不圓滑。</p>
<p>雷翁失敗了，當夜入大總統府覆命，第三種組合的陣容從此也隨之天折。</p>
<p>四。</p>
<p>大總統沃里歐今晨起來，考慮到雷翁失敗於社會急進黨的棄權議員身上，何不請社會急進黨員來一試呢？平十時先請該黨的司法部長担任黨揆，被謝絕了；十時一刻，也請該黨的不管部部長來祖任，也被謝絕了，皆以身體不健爲辭，實則顧慮到社會黨若是也來報復一下，便徒勞無功。到了十一時一刻，才找到民眾共和黨的財政部長許曼，他倒願來一試，當即開始與各黨接頭，到了下午六時，一切停當，只用了七小時，未及雷翁所用的五分之一，許曼便走到國民大會裘，向眾宣佈施政方針。</p>
<p>會塲裹，只有共黨代言人起來辯駁，認爲他的政策不澈底，况又曾任過貝當降敵政府的次長（一九四〇年六月至七月），在賴馬迪內閣中任財政部長時，專在小民身上打算盤，將來一定仍行承　賴馬迪的舊徑，所以決不投信任票。社會黨想到昨晚民眾共和黨會帮助了社會黨黨魁很大的忙，現逢民眾共和黨的許曼出台，當然禮尚往來，無須多發言，投以信任票。民眾共和黨是許曼的一黨，不在話下。其餘諸黨覺得許曼在任時，爲人清白公正，亦無須發言，投以信任票。至於戴高樂派的七十餘席，因爲許曼未曾像雷翁那樣爽直，向右翼攻擎，况又將應邀入閣，於是也不多加反對。</p>
<p>晚九時，投票揭曉，許曼獲到四百十二票的信任，比雷翁多了一百十二票，比憲法規定的絕對多數（三〇九票）還多出一百〇三票呢！只有共黨1百八十四票不信任，但沒多大關係。許曼當即籌劃組閣的人選問題，先與本黨負責人員商酌一下，晚十時一刻，接見社會黨的代表們，十一時接見社會急進黨的代表，到夜深一時還沒有把新內閣人選決定。</p>
<p>依照一般的觀察，許曼能否組起一個穩健的內閣，很成問題，因爲民眾共和黨是十月競選中最遭慘敗的一個黨，這次幸頓社會黨揖讓及處於左右兩大勢力不相容的時機，而許曼始得　選大任。按憲法明文規定：每屆國民大會的頭十八個月，不得連續有兩次閣潮發生，否則，解散議會，政府由議長率同各黨代表暫時管理，其用意在掃除過去第三共和時代閣潮疊起的流弊。目前的國民大會，尚未及一年，若許曼不能維持至明年六月，則議會解散，另行改選，是雖爲戴高樂所不斷地企望者，而第三種陣容的力址，將更受左右兩派的分割。法國右派的輿論，已顧慮到這一點；况政府無人，議長赫理歐將暫攝總揆，赫氏本人是極端反對個人獨裁者，其年已越古稀，一旦不繼，將由副議長共黨杜克婁代之，是更爲右派所忌。所以，許曼本人的政治手段，或尚不及賴馬迪，但由於環境所趨，他的新內閣有不得不實現的原因在。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>就在這時候，工潮澎湃，有不可過止之勢，社會立呈不安。賴馬迪還未辭職的早晨（十九日），法國的北部及巴黎馬賽已有三十萬人在罷工，第二天五百萬人，第三天七百萬人，其重要性可想而知。罷工的範圍，從巴黎展開到全國各地，較五六月間的聯珠性罷工險惡多了。巴黎七個火車站昨天早晨起，有六個相繼地罷了工，對外無形隔絕；巴黎四郊的鐵工完全罷工；法國北部的煤礦每日可出十萬噸煤，現在連六千噸都挖不到；鐵礦也被捲入漩渦；塞納省及巴黎的小學敎師1律怠敎；法國五個大碼頭：Marseille，Rouen，Boroeaux，Nantes，Haure，前四個已完全罷工，後一個將於下星期一取同樣行動，法國地方當局曾想運用軍隊代替，已遭馬賽海軍的拒絕，停港的英美海軍亦取同情的態度，美國Empire　State號巳立電美國總工會C。I。O。表示反對破壞罷工的紀律；此外，巴黎的女裁縫有的也罷工，全國泥瓦匠定於下星期一罷工，公務人員亦準備採取行動，郵局的車夫及職工們已決定罷工，（此稿寄達時或已有重大變化），其他蠢蠢欲動的，尚不知有多少。主要的原因，是物價與工資過於縣殊。</p>
<p>自下星期一起，巴黎兩大交通工具：地道車及公共汽車，同時增價百分之二十五。</p>
<p>當過財政部長的許曼，怎樣來挽救目前的法國現狀，維持法郎價值，調整工資與物價，便是他這內閣久暫的試金石。如能實現，雖非法國的救星，却是千萬個小民的恩人（十一月廿二日巴黎）</p>

<h3>周湘雲一筆遺產　為興學起了紛爭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海灘上，遺產糾紛可以說是司空見慣之事，其發生大多數山於繼承人間利害衝突所致，但最近有一件遺產糾紛却關係着一所大學的創辦，與普通的案件又是不同。</p>
<p>已故甬商周湘雲是上海有數的地產鉅商之一，身後所遺地產價值甚鉅。周氏原配早已去世，遣下一子二女，續　繼室，生有一女，所以遺屬共有妻一人，子一人，女三人。糾紛就發生在元配所生次女的丈夫王逢年與其餘家屬之間，且已亙四年之</p>
<p>王逢年是一位熟心公益捐資興學的人，他的先人王蔭亭亦是一位富商。王氏從先人繼承所得的助產爲興學所費，據說在廿五億元以上。廿七年春並在上海創辦三吳大學，至三十年十二月八日，因敵軍進入租界停辦，但他興學的志願仍無時或輟。</p>
<p>析產糾紛懸而不決</p>
<p>卅二年，周湘雲患病去世，生前未立遺囑，在他臨終之時，由律師高君湘受託草擬了一份「贈產據」，召集周氏親友預備簽訂，其山將約有百分之八十的財產歸給周的妻與子媳。當時周湘雲已命在旦夕，由其妻子捏住他的手簽了一個周字，再也簽不下去，她就拿出他的圖章來印了代替，隨後她與子媳都簽了字，但三位女兒則都沒有簽。因爲王逢年以次女婿的身份，加以反對，他認爲根據法律，「贈產據」的訂立，應在贈產人身體健康之時，但此時周湘雲已不省人事，所以他指高律師有「僞造」之據，並且把高親筆所寫的草稿設法取得，要控之於法，後來經單毓華律師的調解而告作罷。當天下午周湘雲就長辭人世，這筆財產的分析乃懸而不決。</p>
<p>湘雲大學無從開辦</p>
<p>此後，王逢年寫了一封信給周氏家屬，提讓從所有遺產中，提出三分之一興辦湘雲大學，這封信當時同在本市幾家大報上披露，很得社會的同情，但周氏家屬則置之不理。當時因在敵僞統治之下，王亦未能急據進行。</p>
<p>勝利之後，王黨提前議，遺產繼承人方面挽出懇業銀行總經理王伯元來調解。協議結果將遺產分作七份分配，其中一份位落牛莊路及中正中路，約值金條五百餘條的地產，提出興辦公益事宜，亦即創辦湘雲大學。但直到現在地契仍在周氏家屬手中，籌備四年的湘雲大學迄今仍無從建築開辦。</p>
<p>最後一慕且待發展</p>
<p>上月中王氏先則去函再催交出，繼則在報上以湘雲大學籌備處名義，公告保留該兩處地產的處分權，而周氏家屬亦請高君湘等律師代表駁覆，說是這一份地產，雖已決定興辦公益，但應俟變賣以後，再來協議辦些什麼。</p>
<p>前三吳大學同人徐崇欽，單毓華等在上月底亦曾共同致函周氏後人，函中略云：「……先生等追念先　，共襄義舉，則造福人羣，嘉惠學子，誠非鮮淺。倘果不幸誤聰人言，竟違前約，則同人等無論提呈參議會，無論訴諸於法律，揭竿一呼，朝夕可聚，願爲王君後援，不達目的不止」云云。</p>
<p>周氏家人究竟肯不肯交出這份遺產，湘　大學究竟辦不辦得成，我們且等以後的發展吧！</p>
<h3>各種船舶舉行登記</h3>
<p>（乙）管理浦江及蘇州河划船辦法決定如下：　本市職管之各種船舶，自卅七年度號牌執照準備妥當之日起，由公用局警察局會銜佈告，限港內各船於兩個月內向公用局各船舶登記所申請登記，逾期即照取締船舶罰則處理，惟外埠來船，仍於到達時即行申請登託。　三十七年四月一日起開始全港總檢驗，由公用局主辦，水上警察分局派員警協助。</p>
<h3>軍警乘船六折優待</h3>
<p>（丙）軍人乘船優待辦法通過如下：　軍警人員乘船，應憑軍警機關部隊之公函，或差假證，經港口司令部，淞滬備司令部，憲兵獨立第三營，市警察局，輪船商業同業公會共同組織之（上海市）軍警人員購票簽證處發給購票證，憑證向各輪船公司價購六折船票。　軍警携帶之行李及小件貨物如逾旅客携帶行李規定者，仍應繳納運費。</p>

<h3>浦濟段　接軌專車</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十二日航訊〕津浦區鐵路管理局，爲着這－溝通南北的大動脈浦濟段自抗戰勝利以來第一次的修復通車，除在京滬邀請了各界代表及中外記者百餘人於十日乘第一列專車自浦來濟觀光外，同時並另備專車一列邀濟市各界於十一日赴　山張夏間之三八四公里三百公尺處的紅石山麓該綫接軌處作一實際踏勘，同時並參　該路的修復工程。</p>
<p>是日淸晨，我冒着北國的寒風踏進了披紅戴綠，被裝飾得煥然一新的1三一四號專車，車廂裹暖氣開放，室溫如春，綿綿沙法，舒適宜人，擴音器裏播出悠楊的雜曲，使我暫時忘掉車外還是滴水成冰的世界。</p>
<p>車於八點半準時開出，因係初駛，駕駛員時別持重和謹愼，慢慢的軋過了白馬山，　家莊，呈現在我眼前的是路基兩旁堡壘林立，崗哨密佈，稀疏但大部都已殘破不堪的村莊及　廣塲上，老百姓都拿着最原始的</p>
<p>武器紅纓槍</p>
<p>在奔馳操練，其中間亦有在路側祖任放哨勤務的農民，亦手拿紅纓槍，當列車駛過時，做出一種裝模作樣的立正姿勢。</p>
<p>十時一刻，車過崗山至紅石山麓接軌處。路局在這裏特別製了兩個木牌，上寫「接軌處」及其年月日，車到這裘就停下來，大家下軍在接軌處合攝一影後，我並特別為　修該路出力最多的該路工務處宋處長還城，搶修大隊長安文瀾，課長宋建坊合攝一影。自我上次爲文（　十一月十八日本報）對他們的功續加以表揚後，這次的同車各界來賓和同業，都一致　他們爲「搶修英雄」，共匪難有的是「爆炸英雄」，但深信我們的「搶修英雄」</p>
<p>一定可以　破共匪的「暴炸英雄」，建設力終必可以壓倒破壞力的。</p>
<p>去年的膠濟路也是安大隊長他們負　搶修，今年的津浦路徐濟段也在他們餐風沐雨下卒底於成，當大隊長於車中報告搶修大汶河橋七十餘人落水滅頂，及搶修至十一月廿九日夜，因陳局長舜耕限卅日下午一時要搭車由濟赴浦作第一次沿途巡察時，他發動了他的員工廣寢忘食，澈夜搶修，廿多人合抬一鋼軌跑步走着送至工地，活像戰場上的衝鋒陷陣一樣，終於在常夜十一時即在紅石山</p>
<p>順利接軌時</p>
<p>大家都不自禁地感情洋溢，掌聲熟烈地四起了！</p>
<p>十時半，車　南開，十二時四十分到萬德，爲了當晚趕回濟南，車在這裘便掉頭。在這時，我看到很多抬運鋼軌的老百姓，在閒談中，知道他們這鋼軌在過去是受共匪之命遠埋在二三里路以外的泥土裹，這次經路局重賞之下發掘後抬回來的，這根的代價是廿四萬元。（視路之遠近之定價之高低）一位路局朋友和我說：在戰前，凡盜竊或破壞交通者一律殺無　，現在在共匪破路政策下，政府反要拿重價貿回來，而軍事上的一來一往，反迭成了一部人民「埋鋼軌」「賣鋼軌」，拿它公然做起買賣來了！</p>
<p>一時，車由萬　開回濟南，五時平安到達。抵站後′消息傳來，今日匪書一度在萬德以東廿餘里　中四個　及八千民伕準備破路，經國軍加强該處兵力後，已化整爲零各自逃逸，因此，埋藏在大家心頭一個難解的結，正是王司令官耀武所說：「修路周重要，而護路更重要。」（特派員　天（</p>

<h3>華聯不愧盟主　輜汽再受挫　六十八比五十三分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕　汽十六圖業球隊來滬，戰程業已完畢，定陰日赴杭，廿一日轉道赴無錫，廿四日返防。昨晚該隊最後一戰，遇本市冠軍蘇聯隊，　汽究以技差一着，華新發揮精湛之球術，結果六十八比五十三分，運聯獲勝，上半時三十二比二十六，華聯佔先六分。天氣嚴寒，觀衆尙稱　烈，塲內活動看台落成，秩序井然，仍由憲警與四維電車，協力維持秩序。</p>
<p>華聯昨晚在大李指揮下，全以經驗與戰取勝，　汽僅憑其優越之體力反速率進攻，因缺少變化，防守方面，無法抵禦華聯之進攻，　致一　莫展。上半時　滌航之遠射，一再妙中，獲分不少，　使華陷於苦戰，且會以十六比十三，及二十一比二十兩席領前，華聯改變戰略，　見得手，下半時愈打　順，一度以六十二比四十領前二十二分之多，輜汽陣綫全部奔潰。惟輜汽之始終奮鬥到底之精神，使比賽長期在緊張之中，誠屬難能可貴。</p>

<h3>金管局取締錢兌業　限即日起一律停閉　原用銀號錢莊名稱市招均取消</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市錢兌業，向多經營外幣兌換業務，自政府取締黃金買　及外幣流通後，該錢競業早失其業務對象。且查該業率多使用銀號莊牌名，殊與財政部核准之銀錢行莊名義消混。茲悉：財政部上海金融管理局，為正一視聽，並防杜流弊起見，特限今該業自即日起，除經營之錢兌業務，自應停止外，所有原用銀號錢莊名稱及其市招應予取消。該業同業公會，並應撤銷登記，以符事實，而杜　濫。如有延不遵照，或陽率陰違者，一經該局查出，決予送法院，依法嚴辦。聞上項辦法，該局即將公佈，並函上海市政府轉飭執行。</p>
<p>又訊：記者昨為取締錢兌業事，特走坊上海金　管理局負責人，叩詢意見。據稱：本市錢兌業，係在租界時期開始成立，向多經營外幣兌換業務。該業了設立，財政部迄未核准，故一般人均稱之為「地下錢莊」。自政府取締黃金買賣及外幣流通後，該業早失其業務對象，自無存在可能。且最近查獲秘密金鈔買賣者，仍多該業中人，尤屬違背政府法令。本局爰與上海市政府會商決定，並通知該業公會理事長汪　程，自即日起，所有該業，應一律停閉，並取消原有牌號市招改營其他合法業務，以安定社會金融秩序。該負責人並稱：本市經營錢兌業者，共有一九五家，均自即日起，一律停閉云。</p>

<p>是開時平疲之態，迄難改善。永紗開四四七元及四五〇元，及遞交升至四五一元後，即吿下游。塲外息價有提高至三角四分半及三角九之議，力售而退至四三九元及四四〇元，旋又升至四四三元及四四五元，以脫售者多，退至四三五元及四三九元，塲外息價開出為三角一分半及三角六，人心略定。塲外喊價仍高過塲內遞交之數元，聯華永業掛漲停板，永紗再升為四四三元及四四五元。旋降至四二九元及四三〇元，收市為四三〇元及四三一元。結果較前收即交股計中法新華勤興中泥各跌一成，水紗華新閘北信和美亞華豐新光景福內衣永公麗安景綸商務中絲榮豐各跌半成。火柴微挫，統益中絲平平，中紡大通微升，聯華水業兩地產股漲達限度，遞交股新光微降，勤興跌一成，餘均降半成。</p>
<p>後市遞交循例停做，夜報雖有全國銀號及錢兌莊停業之令，但股市反形樂觀，並有某項流言，人心更好，散戶連綿吸收，國行差進雖多，無甚影響，永紗盤高至四四八元，各方脫手，而回低至四三五元左右。經吸納而又哄上至四四〇元收市。收後不免喊低，結果較最收除永業聯華兩地產股仍吿漲停，中紡漲停後有回，軋升一成。統益商務中法各漲半成，華豐升一成，景綸尙平，餘均微升。塲外各老股大生再吿向榮，餘股榮辱俱少。</p>
<p>十二月二十日銀行結息。證交市塲亦休業一天。</p>
<h3>統債外股回疲</h3>

<p>外股昨較遜色，圈外刺激見减，過程平疲。怡紗晨開四〇三〇〇〇元，自四〇七〇〇〇元起退至三九五〇〇〇元，但午後仍回上至四一〇〇〇〇元外收市。證券帮洋行帮錢兌業均出，僅廣帮有納。結果較前收計怡啤墾植英楂華均降半成，電話電車祥泰尙平，餘均微降。</p>

<h3>恢復中日貿易　技術問題待解决　台糖可成為輸日主要商品</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中是兩國商務之實際恢復，尙有若干技術問題需光行解決。除結匯手續之外，尙有信用問題。過去中信局辦理易貨時，因我國輸出品少，致負有數百萬美元之債務，故盟總要求未來中日通商之帳目，需由我國駐日代表團予以担保。代表團因地位關係，未能接受，現一切正在洽商中。</p>
<p>有關人士語記者：有若干技術問題，現正由外交經濟等部會硏究，將於日內送呈政院決定。關於台糖輸日，迄未成　實，惟我國確握有食糖一批，準備東運，現正與對方洽商價格。世上能以食糖供給日本者，我國之外，尙有巴西。以價目而論，巴西糖價　，我國實處於不利地位，但台糖甜性較濃，甚為日人所嗜史，不易改變。故如將來產量增加，將成輸日之主要商品。</p>

<p>昨棉布市况，晨開因銀根空前緊迫，人心虛怯，布商行號斬售不絕，染廠間有减工，白坯布疋吐售甚多。詎至十一時許，出西帮大戶重來，忍痛斬結，受主甚缺，籌碼充沛，喊價一路下瀉。最後十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，一致　吿疾退，自二萬至六七萬元，此外粗細布斜嗶嘰元直貢及漂布等，亦跟降三·四　五萬元不一。</p>

<h3>「蘇聯敎育制度」</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>梅丁斯基著·張季銘譯　三十六年四月開明初版</p>
<p>在近代世界的敎育思想上，蘇聯和美國代表着兩個重要的趨勢，影響其他國家敎育事業的推進。特別是蘇聯，配合着其特有之政治經濟的進展，文化教育事業在質與量上都有驚人的成就。我國今後正將步入民主憲政的新階段，對於發展國民敎育和提振學術研究的風氣，處處都應以人家爲借鏡。雖然我們的政治形態和蘇聯大異其趣，但我們却不妨參考他們在敎情工作上所持的堅毅精神，以他們對文敎事業所抱的强固信念，給我們做一種鼓勵。</p>
<p>這裏我向讀者介紹的是蘇聯敎育博士梅丁斯基（Eugene　Nikolayevich　Medynsky）所著的「蘇聯敎育制度」。梅氏任國立列寗敎育專科學校敎授，他在敎育研究上表現過極擾異的成績，著作甚多。我們從蘇聯的敎育制度中，可以看出他們的文敎事業是在怎樣一種有計劃的設施和監督下，力圖量的擴充和質的改進。敎育制度在某抓意義，實爲敎育思想的反映，我們看蘇聯的敎育制度，不難把握到他們敎育思想上的主要趨向。因爲制度不是憑空建立起來的，它是基於社會的客觀需要以及比較遠大的理想而產生。</p>
<p>本書幾乎全是現實敎育情况的報道，頗少理論的探討，文字簡潔明暢，數字的統計供給我們不少的新近的資料。全書共分十三章，從敎育的目標和組織，學校系統，各級學校設施，師資訓練，成人敎育機構，到敎育研究工作，自成一完整的系統。</p>
<p>蘇聯的敎育實施，能顧及儘量充實現代知識和文化的前提，並須發展他自己的獨立思想及具有飢造性的工作能力。他們認爲要使人人都能自覺地參與政治生活，必須實施强迫敎育，掃除文盲。同時他們又怵於革命以前沙皇時代的俄羅斯，那時的人民在智力與體力勞動之間阻隔着一條鴻溝，現在把它打破了。除了充分發展智力和培養進步的世界觀以外，蘇聯的敎育制度還包括着道德的訓練，當然，他們的道德基礎是建立在社會主義上面的勞動道德。因此他們各級學校和社會敎育機關的訓練，目標着重在正確的勞動實踐和紀律，對工作的愛好與努力。由實用技藝的傳授，擴大對工藝學以及大規模工業和農業生產的興趣，進而學習那些科學的生產技能。</p>
<p>一般人以爲蘇聯的敎育完全受實利思想所左右，一切的教育制度好像全是爲了生產，其實並不盡然。在充實物質生活的另一面，蘇聯的敎育工作者同樣重說文化修養。他們學校的建築和設備，很顧到美化的條件，而藝術敎育的提倡正不遺餘力。蘇聯近年來尤致全力於增設劇院，電影塲，音樂院，美術館，足見其對文化生活的注重，而且把這些場所儘量配合着敎育的意義而推廣改進。爲了發展兒童的審美能力，校外和校內的課業活動並特別強調敎育藝術化生活藝術化這觀點。</p>
<p>對於體育訓練的重視是蘇聯敎育之另一特點，無論在課內或課外活動中，體育訓練均占重要地位，他們把國民的體力看作民族實力的重要「資產」之一，舉凡與婦嬰健康有關的措施以及爲未達學齡的兒童所設的各種保育機關，都已開始基礎的體育訓練了。這中間還含有勞動與國防準備的意義。</p>
<p>從蘇聯的敎育制度上，還可以看出這幾個特徽：　一切敎育機關之取得聯繫，從幼稚園上去到最高級的學校，包括成人敎育在內，都是一直貫串的，通連的；　國家敎育制度由蘇維埃國家會同人民團體以及家庭共同實施；　敎育與敎會分離，不受宗敎約束；　各級學校及一切敎育機關男女同享受敎育的機會；　學校的一致性，沒有任何民族或階級的差異和限制，從最低級到最高級，課業全是連續的；　各級學校對所有的人民開放，初等敎育是普及的而且强迫的；　發展一種民族形式和社會主義內容的文化，並以學生的本國　　敎學</p>
<p>關於蘇聯的敎師，在書中有淸晰的叙說。他們的敎師除了担當敎學的工作，還積極地負據公共事業和國防工作，堅强的團體意識，使他們勇於替國家分擔各種任務。在這次德蘇大戰中，更充分證明了蘇聯的敎師是他們祖國和人民的忠勇兒女，他們的確配稱「文化鬥士」，書中所描述的幾個英勇的校長和敎師慷慨悲壯的事蹟，眞使我們爲之感動不置。蘇聯的教師不僅有聯富的科學知能，有敎學的熱忱，而且有廣闊正確的人生觀，世界觀。國家對敎師盡其全力以謀提高敎師的物質與精神的待遇。敎師福利事業有專門的機關去辦理。敎師不僅地位有保障，而且還可享受到國家種種榮譽的獎勵如銜位和勛章。</p>
<p>蘇聯成人敎育的發展，說明了他們社會敎育上的各種設施，都已有顯著的成效。普及成人敎育幾乎盡了和普及初等敎育同樣的力量，成人中等學校乃是適應特殊需要而設立的。圖書館和含有敎育意義的俱樂部在數量上和內容上都有驚人的成果，新興的「文化休息公園」，和博物館，美術館，在成人敎育方面尤有極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>至於敎育研究工作，在蘇聯現已應用各稱科學的研究方法，探討理論與敎學實施的諸種問題。現除國立列寗科學敎育研究所外，尚有公共敎育計劃及組織研究所，工藝敎育學研究所，中央民族敎育研究所，兒童讀物研究所，課程及敎學法研究所等。蘇聯的敎育家研究幼稚期的發展特點，已應用幼稚園。一切教育制度的建立均根據專家的研究結果。對於教育史的湛深研究，蘇聯的敎育學者著作頗多新型的敎育文藝另創敎育著述的一個新的風格。成立不到五年的蘇聯敎育科學院（本書著者也是該院工作人員之一）在原理，哲學．心理學，敎學法各方面創擭了不少光輝的成果。如今正不知多少名敎授埋首於研究工作。</p>
<p>縱觀蘇聯的敎育制展，處處和他們的政治，經濟，社會情况息息相關，多少免不了染上狹義的「國家主義」的色彩，但他們的教育却已發展到專業化，科學化和生活化。因爲專業化故能注重研究工作。因爲科學化故能注重設備，及新工具和優良敎法的應用。因爲生活化故能使敎育和廣大社會的人民生活發生聯擊。至少蘇聯的敎育設施，是在循着一個目標一種計劃進行。從制度上可以看出他們的敎育是有獨特的「個性」的。看看人家，應該回想自己，知所取捨與警惕，同時也是一種很可貴的啟示與激勵。</p>
<h3>介紹電動機</h3>
<p>— 芒</p>
<p>黃幼雄著　開明書店版</p>
<p>「電動機」全書共分三編：第一編內分九章，第二編內分五章，第三編內分七章。第一編分述電動機的原理與構造，以及最簡單電動機的製作，由最簡單的而說到各式高級電動機的製造。本編的最後一章，更給了我們一個正確的觀念，我們從前總以為同一大小的電動機，如果用高低不同的電壓而使轉動；那麼，供給高電壓時，所出之力當然大，供給低電壓時，所出之力常然小，其實並不如我們理想的一樣，同一大小的電動機，無論供給之電壓或高或低，其所出之力還有相同的，然而在沒有讀本書以前的我，却不知道實在的情形，這不是矯正了我們以前錯誤的觀念嗎？</p>
<p>第二編內分述變壓器的原理，以及各種大小變壓器的製作，因爲用乾電池或蓄電池來轉動電動機是太不經濟了，只有仰給於電燈綫的電流，但電燈綫通用的電壓很高，不能直接取用，必須利用變壓器將電壓减低後方可應用，故變壓器在應用上是必不可少的一樣東西，第三編才說到電動機的應用，這裏告訴你電車的原理，如何使電動機應用於車輛，電扇等東西上，更有趣的是利用電動機使木偶人跳舞，這些有趣的應用，等到你實際製作應用時，你會驚奇的說：「電動機的能力是多麼偉大啊」！</p>
<p>本書的優點在於說理簡單而明白，使人看了易於瞭解，即使是完全不懂電學的人，看過本書後，也可得到相當的了解，而且在製作電動機時，有許多是很簡單的問題，但是經過文字的解釋，反而變成複雜的了，著者在本書裹却說得非常澈底，流利的筆法，便人看了不覺深奧，我們讀過本當後，至少對於「電」這一個東西，有了一個槪括的觀念，這是我們應該感謝薯作者的賜予的。</p>
<p>我國有很大的水力，可以供給我們發電，但是我們却沒有能够充分地利用，這是很覺可惜的事，也是因爲我們對於電學沒有密切的注意和深確的忽識，總以爲電是一個神秘的東西，其實電是我們親切的朋友，日常生活中不可缺少的東西。我們可以利用電力作爲機械的原動力，來積極的發展我國的工鑛事業，可是我們沒有電學知識怎樣辦呢？首先必須要知過如何應用電動機，那麼，讀了本書以後，就可開始來應用電動機了。所以我認爲無論那一個人，只要他有利用電動機的志願，而沒有利用電動機的能力的人，都應該去買此書一讀，不但要讀，而且要自己動手做，更進一步的，要把常動機別出心裁的利用起來。</p>
<h3>對於修正出版法的一些意見</h3>
<p>— 冷眼</p>
<p>現行的出版法，係於民國二十六年七月八日公布的，那時，正常蘆溝橋事變發生的次一日，全國人士一心致力於抗戰，，對該出版法的缺點，未遑注意。日本投降，又因國內破碎，百廢待興，國人亦未曾提出一些修改意見，因此該出版法公布了已有十年，國人從不以其欠缺而有所批評。最近，訓政即將結束，行憲就在目前，當局也於十月三十一日及十一月一日各報上發表了一些修正要點。可是，正式修正之出版法，則至今仍未公布出來，因此我敬願以一得之愚，寫出來請大家商討。</p>
<p>出版商人中少數的敗類只顫自己的利益而不管浪費紙張，使讀者蒙受損失，以侵害別的權益。譬如某一書店，出了一本某名家的書（當然指一股小書店而言），爲了希望多銷去幾本，於是，內容完全一字不易，封面及書名不妨改過，同時會陳列在一處出售。讀者先買了某書，又見此書的書名類似，便也不加細察，購作參考，結果是買了異名同質的東西，金錢上就受到了損失。這種商人的取巧，出版法中似乎應有明文取締。</p>
<p>言論自由，民主國的人民是應該享受的。然而，自由也要有一個限度。修正要點之中已經說過，就是不意圖顚　國民政府或損害中華民國利益。祇要合此標準，就不該加以干涉。可是，近年來爲了報紙批評了政府及官吏的失當，往往會遭到了毆打記者，搗毀報館，撕毀刋物，禁止出版。這是報紙上見了不知多少次了。批評是希望走上正軌，不是顚覆政府或損害國家利益，似乎出版法中要詳加說明，道才够得上說是保陣言論自由。</p>
<p>色情刋物，導民於淫逸，這不僅對文化沒有帮助，抑且有害於人民的思想和道德，這能不能算是「損害中華民國利益」，衹注意於談政治的「有損害」而不注意談色情的「有損害」。這未免是知一不知二了。</p>
<p>又出版法與著作權法有連帶關係，似應同時詳加修訂才對。</p>
<h3>中等英文法</h3>
<p>— 汪毓周</p>
<p>呂叔湘著　開明書局發行</p>
<p>這書共計十六章，二百九十四面，分上下兩册，上册縷述句的構造，下册分述八種詞類，用作高級中學一二年級敎本，極爲適合。下面略舉數點，以爲介紹。</p>
<p>一，這書是根據Otto　Jespersen的Essentials　of　EnglishGrammar（英文法要義）和Palmer的Grammar　of　Spoken　English（語體英文法）兩書而參以著者十餘年教學上的心得所編成的。</p>
<p>一，解釋用的文字，在簡明中力求賅括，舉例及練習用的語句，切合日常的生活；所以閱讀</p>
<p>這書，不但毫無苦澀乏味的感覺，並且極易增加進修的興趣。</p>
<p>一，句子的構造和用法，占了全書一半的篇幅，他書所略而不提的地方，這書敘述的格外詳細，而於Subjecb　object　complement等的形式（單詞，仂語，子句）和在句內的各種位置，指示更見明晣。</p>
<p>一，例句豐富，且合實用，使讀者易於模仿。在三種Clauses的應用方面，設例尤多。</p>
<p>一，兼顧口語和文言，如口語裏說Who　did　you　see？文章體作W＇hom　did　you　see？之類，皆特加說明。</p>
<p>一，顧及讀音，如S和ed置於字尾時的讀法，普通文法書上，都不提及的，這書講道nouns和verbs形體變化的地方，分別在字後注明，例如。cu”（s）；ideas（z）；allows（z）;asked。（t）；expected（id）。</p>
<p>除了上面幾點以外，還有不少特色，祇有在閱讀的時候，纔能心領神會，恕我不能逐一提出。著者會任中學教師，富有教學經驗，深悉一般學生之缺點輿需要，雖近年任敎大學，已以中國文法之研究馳名，而出其緒餘，寫作本書，仍然當行出色。從我三十年教學經騐上看來，這是一部量新穎最適用的英語文法，對於中學英語敎師，一定有極大的幫助。</p>
<p>對於這樣一部好書，我們又不禁有責備求全的意思。我覺得標點符號的用法，雖然屬於作文的範鬨，文法內也未嘗不可講一些，作為附錄（林著開明英文法就包括這一項）。其次，這書得說明和舉例，雖然巳較他書淺顯，究竟還是有少數對於中學生是生疎的詞語，似乎可以摘出，加以中文註釋，附在全書之後，使自修的學生獲得更多的便利。希望著者再版時考慮我們這兩個建議。</p>
<h3>紀德的「女學」</h3>
<p>— 呂絃</p>
<p>瑞典學院決定將今年的諾貝爾文學獎金給予法國當代文豪安特烈。紀德，並宣稱：「因共作品題材深刻，藝術完美，所叙述的人生問題及情况，表示其勇於愛慕眞理，精於分析心理。」</p>
<p>據卞之琳先生說，「女性的風格」在國內至少有三種譯本：王了一「一個少女的夢」；陳占元：「婦人學校」；金滿成：「女性的風格」。而照卞之琳先生的譯法，則應該是「女學」。</p>
<p>這眞是一件奇妙的事，從各個不同的譯名，倒很可以想見各個譯者的不同的風格了。</p>
<p>如果說「女性的風格」「羅培耳」「日尼薇」原是一幅三聯畫（紀德在「日尼概」的作者前記中這麼說），則「女學」應該是三聯畫中的第一幅。</p>
<p>顯然，紀德有着一種强烈的慾望，要想以女性自己的嘴來吐露女性底的秘密，這秘密包含的很廣：心理，思想，人生觀，作風，人品……：全在他的刻畫範圍之內。這計劃是龐大的，但我們不必爲紀德担心，地的作風永遠是那麼細膩，精緻，美妙無比，所以他的企岡雖大而無當，他自己也尚不致迷途。抓住小小的一點，他就把全書的骨架支撑起來了。論氣魄，紀德的書絕不能與羅曼羅蘭的「約翰·克里斯朶夫」相比；論手法，紀德的精緻的技巧亦非他人所能及。尤其是在以女性爲刻畫對象的時侯，紀德是更凸出的一個。屠格湼夫也善於描繪女性，却不免流於淺薄，左拉則流於浮誇，托爾斯泰嫌太深沉了些，羅曼羅蘭則太熟烈，而只有A·紀德，才當得起細膩和精緻。他委婉曲折地道來，末了就歸結到他的宿命論：「女性之所以爲女性」。紀德的最奇妙的手法，是能借用小小的意境發揮他的哲理，「浪子回家集」中的各篇是最好的說明。</p>
<p>我是喜歡「女學」這本書的，全書充滿着幽美的格調，從狂戀到徹悟，從大幸福到大絕望，從少女懷春的心境到婦人深沉的情感……都有極美的描繪。因爲用的是日記體裁，所以格調上較近散文詩，而不像是小說。以窺探女性心底內蘊爲題材的小書，A·莫洛亞也有過幾本，但較之紀德，前者的描繪就不免是皮毛之見了。</p>
<p>愛維琍，一個純眞的女人，和紀德其他小說中的主角一樣，同時也是一個幽美，深沉，固執的女人，當她還是在少女時代，她在某次漫遊中邂逅到一個英俊的年靑男子羅伯，他倆戀愛了，訂婚了。「女學」第1部就是愛維琍在訂婚前所寫下的斷想。她狂熟地愛她的情人，顯然有點近於盲目，因此日記中全是少女的眞摯的語句，雖然她大澈大悟地說：「看見女人生在這世上的理由，是無非使她們的天賦。品行。更有價值，而所有的價值呢，無非是某一位「某先生」喜悅程度深或淺的附庸品，這眞呌我不痛快。」但她對她的情人羅伯，情形也正如此。</p>
<p>然而，愛維琍的一往情深的性格固然使她盲目了若干時侯，時間一久，情慾稍淡，再加以她本是一個眞勢得近於固執的人，所以量後終於發覺了羅伯的抓種卑鄙可恥的虛偽姿態下面隱藏蕭的汚穢來。——是的，這已經是二十年以後的事了。二十年，在一個女人身上會起多大的變化，這是難以估計的，依照常情，愛維琍的性格即使未被羅伯所同化，也該被「時間　磨蝕殆盡了吧？可是紀德決不使他的女角安於命運，二十年後，愛維琍旣不贊賞羅伯的虛僞做作，反而忍無可忍，像沉默已久的火山終於爆發了一樣，她以她得激情刺傷了羅伯，刺傷了她得親人們，也刺傷了他自己</p>
<p>愛維琍不安於她的壞境，不安於她的命運，尤不安於她有這麼一個丈夫。道是爲什麼呢？就因爲一個成熟了的婦女，一個各方面都有她的定見的婦女，從她的眼裏看出去，羅伯之流的「自我犧牲」劇即使演得再悲壯些，也只是人間常有的趣劇而已。她幾次想脫出牢籠，幾次想離開了從前她如此盲目地鍾情過的丈夫的掌握，然而不能，整個社會的同情顯然不在她這邊，而在那虛僞的道貌岸然的羅伯這一邊。</p>
<p>愛維琍幾次在日記中提到她的女兒，說起日尼薇如何在旁邊冷靜地觀察父母間的衝突，這裹，就爲「日尼薇」一書作了伏錢。</p>
<p>紀德善於寫解說性的文學作品，卞之琳先生評他的「浪子回家集」說：「</p>
<p>……不管繽紛的外觀，這些文字的重點是在思想或觀念。奧義的表白方法最完美的無過託諸象徵，使言筌也成爲結晶。」事實上，「女學」也是這麼一本象徽性的小說，沒有比卞之琳先生的批許更確當了。</p>
<p>如果有人編婦女問題叢書，我認爲紀德的幾個小册子都可以入叢書之內．在中國，紀德作品的翻譯者也不少，最忠實的應推盛澄華，譯筆自有其雅趣的應推卞之琳，黎烈文也曾譯過一些紀德的東西，收在他的「邂逅草」中，如「論古典文學等」等，尚不失紀德獨有的韻調。這回的「女學」，我讀的是金滿成的譯本，筆調就有點美味了，這也許是跟了解的程度有關的吧。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論雅俗共賞</h3>
<p>— 王起</p>
<p>從前馬隅卿先生得到明刻本馮夢龍「語窗」「欹枕」二集及初刻的「平妖傳」，自名其堂爲平妖堂，又稱爲「不登大雅文庫」，蓋馬氏以珍藏元明小說蜚聲國內，而稗官一流，自古被歧視爲不登大雅者也。</p>
<p>可是這樣的小說，其實正是登了大雅，磁靑紙面子，雪白連史襯頁，白絲綫裝訂，錦緞或藍布的套子，合當擺在國立北平圖書館的義本室或是什麼齋館堂室之中，比起從前專門在引車販漿者流的手中流轉傳誦，簡直不可同日而語，所謂不登大雅云云，毋寗是一個議刺。</p>
<p>古小說被學者們雅化了，不雅的百姓們立刻又弄了新的出來。自古至今，永遠如此。反正雅人是不會創迭的，只會搶了老百姓的東西，先是欣賞，後來就嫌他們太俗，太鄙，於是雅之，雅得直到百姓們不要了爲止。宋詞，元曲，以及唐人絕句，六朝樂府，那個不如此？南戲起於溫州，而崑曲行於崑山，現在我保險這些地方的老百姓都不會懂了，他們要唱的是灘簧或其他。山西梆子到北京成了京梆子，又雅之爲「秦腔」，漢調徵調也雅成皮黃，而民間仍自有他們嶄新的有生命的東西。如今紹興戲已被都市的人們惡聲惡相的雅化了，說不定將來有一天紹興人也許不懂所謂「越劇」。</p>
<p>好像沈德符在「野獲篇」裹慨歎過「打棗竿」「掛枝兒」諸小曲之風行，以爲世風日下之徴。其實這第一是忘了古代的楊枝詞，柳枝詞之類；第二是證明掛枝兒尚未澈底的雅起來。果然眞的不表現「世風日下」了，那也就是說，成了「廟堂之物」，與百姓不復相干。．</p>
<p>然而又有人提出雅俗共賞的一句話，這說法看起來很好，但實際上是不通的，因為雅和俗永遠對立，決不能「共」起來。欣賞「下里巴人」的俗物，絕不欣賞「陽春白雪」。而博得和者數百人的「陽阿薤露」，似乎是「中問分子」了吧，豈知這種人乃是旣不俗又不雅兩面都够不上的尶尬東西，是「兩不」，而不是「共」！</p>
<p>那麼，除了俗，就是雅；而雅之外，皆是俗。中國之雅足怎麼產生的？中國的文學者是掠奪了民間文學的體製而刻意加以雅化，隨後便將那些俗人臭罵1通</p>
<p>若是稍微捧塲的多一點，就自鳴得意地說：「雅俗共賞」！</p>
<h3>人窮則文必不佳論</h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>最近看到美國「大西洋」雜誌的九十週紀念號，頗有所感。</p>
<p>第一，美國在目前雖算是强國中之强國，但它的民族實在幼雅而又幼稚，文化也短暫而至今尚未演成定型，距我國自誇的五千年文化相去甚遠。但人家已有九十年歷史的雜誌，雖然不及「年高德劭」如英國之「笨拙」，但也足以在世界雜誌之林中稱大阿哥了。我們便沒有這樣的雜誌。有生氣的不是夭折，便是受盡磨折，終至不能存在。「東方雜誌」總算是最老大的了，也有數十年的出版歷史，可是誰還記得這樣一本雜誌？</p>
<p>第二，在美國綜合性的雜誌中，「大西洋」和「哈柏斯」要算是最高級的，前者略重文藝，後者則尤注重於思想和政論。這兩種東西，雖然未必眞能做到篇篇可　，但至少有十分之七以上，都有一讀的價値。「通俗性」的「星期六晚郵」和「柯列爾」之類在美國固能擁有兩三百萬讀者，可是高級如「大西洋」，「哈柏斯」，也有十多萬人經常購買，這事便可看出美國人的文化水準來：大多數人是庸俗的，但，所以像「大西洋」之類也能存在下去。這在我國，方型週刋固可「暢銷」，而眞正有份量的高級刋物，不是絕無僅有，便是有了也沒有讀者，結果總是關門了事。此事有關民族文化百年大計，可是誰注意到這些呢？</p>
<p>「大西洋」雜誌創刋於九十年前，當時原有點同人雜誌性質，不過由某一出版家和幾個文人談起，在場的人都願意帮忙，結果便出版了。此事詳見「大西洋」九十週紀念號中「美國雜誌之成長」一文。當時參加寫稿的都是代表新英格籣（美國的書香之區）文化的一流作家，他們當時抱着「以當代最佳作家的最佳作品公之於世」的志願，九十年後的今日，這目的是達到了。創刋者有此勇氣，讀者也有接受的勇氣，「大西洋」始能光耀於世。反觀我們，有這樣創始精神的作家固不多見，有這樣遠見的出版家更幾乎沒有，讀者呢，更渾渾噩噩，不能支持一個好的刋物，一部分是經濟力量關係，一部分還是風氣使然，缺乏讀書的熟情，造成了今日出版界的眞空。</p>
<p>第三，美國雜誌如「大西洋」，尤其是這一期九十週年紀念號，內容實在可以說美不勝收，「綜合」也綜合到了相當均衡的地步。試看它的幾篇重頭文章：愛因斯坦論原子戰爭與和平，威克脫輯未發表的馬克吐溫情書，威爾斯論美國國務院的壓力派系與外交政策，塞奇威克（「大西洋」現任編輯）論編輯技巧，瓊斯論近代人之信仰，蕭伯納論鑒術家之養成1，毛　論布伐利夫人，林白夫人的誇，閱此幾有「今文觀止」之感．</p>
<p>人家爲什麼有這麼多的好文章？第一是編輯有眼光，第二是出版家肯化錢，第三是編者肯出力。以上三者，一二已難做到，第三尤不能等閒說之。</p>
<p>編者有眼光，然後有新的作家會產生，外國文壇有所謂「發現者」，即指此抓編輯而言。編者有眼光，然後有r其人其事」的文章出現。西洋雜誌上登過「一女侍目中的希特勒」，「我的情夫畢索里尼」，莫洛亞著「法軍崩潰內幕」，「我怎樣投鄉原子彈」，溫莎公爵「回憶錄」等，非其人不能寫共事，凡此皆足以傾世人耳目。中國的雜誌爲何不去請顧維鈞寫「外交人物印象」呢？爲何不去請宋子文寫「借債術」呢？西北風雲人物阿合買提江也至今沒有人寫過他的來踪去跡，「接收外史」也至今沒有出現。中國人沒有發表的習慣，固然是一大原因，編輯限光的缺乏也是事實。</p>
<p>要出版家化錢，尤難於要出版家之命。美國「生活」畫報特載不愛江山愛美人的溫莎公爵的三篇回憶錄，出多少稿費，至今還是「生活」與溫莎之間的秘密，外問無從探悉。此數諒必可觀。要搶購邱吉爾的「第二次世界大戰史」自然所費不貲。中國的出版家只想抄襲，誰願出這樣的大價錢來買稿子？</p>
<p>中國目前之無好文章可讀，其實是不必完全歸咎於某一方面的，這祗是一個窮的問題，人窮志短，於是出版家只想「撈一票」，寫文章的人也只能以多見長了。想到這裹，禁不住望「大西洋」而興嘆！</p>
<h3>棋錯一着</h3>
<p>— 黎里</p>
<p>世界上百千萬億人的命運，往往會被某些人僅僅一個不留意的動作所左右。這種一着之錯，有時眞是不可思議的。</p>
<p>法王路易十四的財政大臣之一，倘不名爲福奎，則法國或者幾乎可以佔有現在大英帝國的大部份，而所謂德國也者，或將成爲一羣無害的小王朝。一個人的名字呌福奎自然沒有甚麼錯，而且那也是無能爲力的，但他却不必要地去弄花巧，那走錯一步了。原來在古時的法國一福奎」之義爲一「松鼠」，而這位福奎，就將這小動物炫耀在他的武器上，並綴以題詞：「以天空爲界」。實在呢，他對海洋是比天空更感興趣的。</p>
<p>不管他是遠見還是近視，總之他決定勸告法王，法國要建立一兩洋海軍，他以爲藉其龐大的艦隊，法國就能隨其旗　飄處開展商業；則所獲之利，將遠較經年不斷在東陲作戰爲大。路易十四被說心動，就趕來參加福奎設在塞納河邊別墅內的一個宴會，以便詳聆高論。豈知未及聽妙論，先見妙文：在門上，地毯上，椅上，碟子上，以及僕人們的制服上，到處都是松鼠，旁綴題詞，宣稱福奎先生「以天空爲界」！這當然不合專制皇帝的脾胃，於是路易十四一怒而去。福奎遭開革，建立海外帝國的理想自然一起告吹，結果是法國人東進萊茵河，而德法間的疲勞戰爭就接踵而起了。</p>
<p>另一「一着之錯」發生在一七五七年，後來發現是鑄成了大錯。一位英國陸軍部的書記拒絕了一對請求在英軍內任職的自薦書。該書發自那位名震寰宇的喬治華盛頓，常時是浮吉尼亞民團的上校。華盛頓上校誠然會因他的英勇而拯救過一隊英軍脫離危境，但這傢伙是殖民地人民，而且父母均非英國人，因此讓他在當地總督手下任職，已經算非常優待了。於是他就成爲一種地方自衛團隊的團長，其階級永遠不及任何英國陸軍內上尉以下的軍官。自然華盛頓另有他的打算，他不忘不赦；那次一着之錯的代價是整個美國。倘當時那對自薦書竟蒙批准，後來的事情就正未可知了！</p>
<p>百年之後，在一八五七年，英國又失去了一大塊帝國的人心。東印度公司軍隊中的土著兵國發到一批彈筒。這種彈筒應用塗油的彈帽，而在舊有的槍砲上，此項彈帽必須用口哎去，以便火藥得以傾下於槍身與砲身之內。塗數於彈筒上的油，一部份是用的牛油，那在印度敎人是神聖不可侵犯的；而另一部份是用的豬油，却又大干回敎徒之怒。眞是再巧也沒有了，一下子侮辱了全印度的人民！好個「一着之錯」結果是立刻發生了印度的叛變。</p>

<p>綺紈道：「我令天多喝幾杯酒，城道裏疎散政欲，覺得很舒服。時光過得眞快，我上次來這裹看賽船還是夏天，一轉眼巳是秋末冬初，人怎的不老呀！」渚齋笑道二「你正是黃金時代，怎麼也嘆老呢！」綺紈道：「人都說我是黃金時代，我也自認是黃金時代，可惜我對這黃金時代，把握不住。以我家庭環境和我藝術的前工，只怕辜負這黃金時代了！」渚齋道：「一個人成功，都由奮鬥出來，你已打破重重難關，前途極有希望，不要過於退縮。」二人談談說說，不覺已走到流水音，站在亂山石堆砌的平臺上一看，一輪皓月，已破雲而出，淸光瀉地如銀。渚齋道：「今晚月色很好，我們在這裹坐一會如何？」說時拿出手絹，在一隻石凳上，把土撣凈，用手絹鋪好，讓綺紈坐下，自己隨挨坐她身旁。綺紈望着月光說道：「今夜月光太好，衹可惜月不常圓，過了幾天又虧了！」渚齋道：「月有盈虧，是循環定數，我祇認人生應及時行樂，不要過於憂慮！」綺紈明知渚齋這話是安慰她，心裹甚爲感觸，不由把身子向渚齋挨緊一些，正要把心裘苦悶吐露出來，這時天上一片飛雲，突把皓月蓋住，大地頓形黑贈。渚齋道：「梨園界有一句行話「雲遮月」，像譚鑫培嗓子，沙中帶亮，梅蘭芬嗓子，沙中帶脆，都是「雲遮月」，昨晚我聰你的玉堂春，有幾句像梅先生的脆聲，只可惜大家都不理會。」綺紈把身子向渚齋微微一肘道：「你別瞎說，我那能比得上梅先生！」這時月亮已穿雲而出，大地復現光明，渚齋見綺紈的玉容爲月光所照，美麗無比，笑道：「你怎麼比不上梅先生，以你的年齡論比他小三十多歲，他就再上台，也不及從前了，你不要自己太菲薄，太退縮重」綺紈道：「我的志趣很高，我也很想努力，只爲我目前環境所限，要想發勝是很困難的。現在我學了梅先生幾齣古裝本戲，只添置行頭一項，就難死人了！現在比不得梅先生唱戲的時代，唱梅派戲，有沒有人捧場，是一問題。添置行頭，更是一個重大問題。」</p>

<p>繍像重慶評話</p>
<h3>碩鼠篇</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文　龍生畫</p>
<p>在四川，特別在重慶，鼠咬人，甚至把嬰兒的鼻子時落，正如狗咬人，不含有太多的新聞性的。貓是那樣少，而且那樣容易死亡，一吃了鼠肉便會得不治之病。常然只好由鼠們猖獗了，只看它體重數斤，便知共食量之宏，除偸吃以外無法求生，關於這是應該怪上帝安排了它們的本能，却又不關切它們的食料的。</p>
<p>更可惡的是，嚙壞了不能吃的東西，則是鼠們在有意的損人不利己。例如吃衣袋裏的花生米之類，一定要咬破衣服，却比吃嬰兒的鼻子更可惡，客觀爲鼠設想的：嬰兒　略近於食料，衣服是一點不能充饑的。雖然前者更殘酷。</p>
<p>人亦如是</p>
<p>在戡亂聲中微實是應該的．甚至揩一點油如「大斗進，小斗出」，老百姓都不說什麼了，正如旣然無貓，只能認命然而必須呌農民從鄉下百十里外挑來，挑來之後，故意遲遲多日不驗收，使人勞力時間而躭誤‵而又被迫要在城裹負担多天的貴價伙食，是普遍於川中的農民怨聲。川中貪汚之風已成，老百姓對於貪汚虐民彷彿已見慣不驚了，不得已求其次，「無補於貪汚的虐民的事少做」，成爲農民聯香禱之的要求，像因轉災歉收是靠天吃飯者惟有自怨自艾的宿命，只求不把莊稼吃得赤地千里。</p>
<p>不久以前，行總重慶難民站結束後，被木船夫們包圍，不能上車上飛機的稽核主任只好宵遁，引起軒然大波。據招待記者時發表的證據，是爲了待算賬目，先行扣了木船在漢口，使重慶船夫在漢口等候半年，到發還船價時，船夫已吃盡當光，船上帶來的老婆兒女都在異鄉賣掉了。</p>
<h3>怪學生</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>十二月十二日，成都成華大學學生遊行，遍街貼標語，謂「不國立勿寗死」。語云，死或重於泰山，或輕於鴻毛，大學生因所肄業之學校不改國立而寗願自盡，其死重於泰山乎？輕於鴻毛乎？</p>
<p>夫貪生惡死，人之常情，普天之下飢寒交迫之人不知多少，自殺者究鮮有所聞。他們也許是渾渾噩噩之輩，只知茍延殘喘，不足以語死之偉大者，置不論。成華大學那幾十百位學校「不國立勿寗死」的學生，其「輕生」精神之發揚，實屬前無古人！</p>
<p>我不懂大學之私立國立，何以攸關學生之生死。如學校不國立學生即願自殺，那麼世界上這麼多的私立大學之創辦人校董校長，個個都難逃敎唆自殺之罪了，世界上不應有這麼多的私立大學了，不該有這麼多的私立大學肄業生與業生了。即使說唯成華大學不國立學生將難以活命，退學也總比尋死好得多。然而那批遊行貼標語的學生偏偏寗死無他，豈非嘖嘖怪事。</p>
<p>中國原是敬老的國家，現在則是敬靑年，尤其是靑年而學生的國家了。几靑年學生的一舉1動，無不鼓掌稱善，說這樣做就是愛護靑年，不遺餘力。然而靑年究竟是靑年，如能恕我不敬，我要把國家未來主人翁的靑年學生，比作家庭裏傳宗接代的兒童。英儒羅素「曾經過到過一個女士，她主張兒童永遠不應該被禁止去做任何事情；因爲一個兒童應從內部發展其天性，故在其發展途上，不應遇外來阻礙。」而羅素問她：「如其天性引他把針吞到肚裏，該怎麼辦？」且「徵之事實，我們總不能不承認每個小孩如眞個完全放任他去自由行動，遲早總會把針吃到肚裏。」（引文見羅素懷疑論集）在中國境內，不少主張水遠不應禁止靑年學生做任何事情的靑年導師，以學潮來說，几學生一鬧學潮，他們無不寄學生以無限同情，不管鬧的究是怎麼一回事。結果，學校不國立勿寗死的標語也貼出來了，要是成華大學眞個不改國立而學生眞個從口號到實踐，豈不是等於小孩的吞了一把針對肚裏？</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer Urges Increased Aid to China, Presents Views at Senate Appropriations Committee, Truman Signs Emergency Aid to Europe Bill</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 17th (Broadcast) Washington dispatch, General Wedemeyer stated his views at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th, believing that Chairman Chiang is "the reasonable leader of China today," urging the United States to increase aid to China without any bias, and hoping that China can make effective use of this aid. Wedemeyer said: "Whether Chiang is a benevolent dictator or a democratic leader, I don't think it matters. The most important point is that he has always opposed the Communist Party." He further stated: Chiang Kai-shek could have made peace with Japan on "extremely favorable terms" at the height of the Pacific War, which would have allowed Japan to dispatch "1.5 million troops to fight against the Americans," but Chiang "always kept faith with the Allies, and his high character is admirable." When asked whether the United States should immediately provide military supplies and economic assistance to China, Wedemeyer strongly stated, "I think it should." He said: Chiang "needs and deserves help." Chiang has always abided by the agreements made with our country, and if I were Chiang, I would be extremely impatient with the United States. Wedemeyer believes that the surplus military supplies piled up by the United States in various parts of the Pacific are not suitable for China, because what China needs are light weapons. He told the committee that before he left China, Chiang had assured him of two points: China will continue to oppose communism, and will try to establish a democratic government, but whether a democratic government can be established depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union, the attitude of the United States, and whether the economy can be stabilized. Wedemeyer declined to disclose the contents of the China visit report, because the President ordered him to keep it secret, and if the committee forced him to explain the details, it would put him in an "embarrassing situation." Although Wedemeyer did not directly mention the name of the Soviet Union in his speech, he said that the United States is facing an opposing ideological force all over the world. The United States must stop the expansion of this force and then re-enter the areas affected by this force. [Our Dispatch] New York, 17th (Broadcast): Washington dispatch, President Truman signed the $597 million Emergency Aid to Europe Relief Bill on the 17th without holding a ceremony. The President is expected to make a statement at a press conference on the afternoon of the 18th. It is also reported that Truman plans to submit a long-term aid to Europe plan to Congress on Friday.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Appropriations Committee Decides to Temporarily Withhold Aid to China Funds</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee submitted a bill to the House on the 16th that would cut $88 million from the total amount of emergency foreign aid approved by Congress and temporarily withhold aid to China funds. The bill also recommends that the U.S. Army reduce the cost of maintaining occupied areas by $260 million. The committee submitted a supplementary appropriation bill, which included the following:</p>
<p>590 million US dollars are allocated for emergency foreign aid, which is 15% less than the relief funds for Italy, Austria, and China approved on the 15th.</p>
<p>Of the 490 million US dollars requested by the Army for relief and military government expenses in Germany, Japan, Korea, and Austria, only 230 million US dollars are allocated, a reduction of 53%. Chairman Taber of the House Appropriations Committee said that the reason why the committee did not allocate funds to China was because the funds would not be used until Secretary of State Marshall submitted his plan. The committee's report quoted Republican Congressman Judd as saying: "Until Marshall submits his plan, I do not believe that the Appropriations Committee has a responsibility to allocate funds to China, and in fact, this allocation should not occur."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The House Appropriations Committee's bill to cut foreign aid funding has been sent to the House for review. House Democratic members immediately expressed their opposition and attempted to restore the original amount. Even if the House approves the reduction and excludes China, the Senate may increase it and re-include China, pending a final decision by a joint conference of the two houses.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 16th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee today canceled the aid to China portion of the temporary aid bill, pending the government's proposal of a more specific aid to China plan. According to the Appropriations Committee, the $88 million deducted from today's temporary aid bill should be reserved for China or other approved plans.</p>
<h3>China and the United States Consult on Aid to China and the Japanese Peace Conference, Ambassador Gu Visits Assistant Secretary of State Elbrick</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun visited Assistant Secretary of State Elbrick on the 16th to discuss the United States' expedient aid to China plan and the Japanese peace conference, which lasted 80 minutes. After the meeting, Mr. Gu told reporters that China was very pleased that the United States' emergency aid plan included China, and hoped that aid to China "will not only end with this expedient aid." Gu's visit was before he learned that the House Appropriations Committee had removed China from the emergency aid list. It is possible that the House will overturn the Appropriations Committee's opinion and restore the original number of aid to China. It is said that after meeting with Elbrick this time, he felt that the United States had not completed the details of the long-term aid to China plan. According to Marshall, the number will be around 300 million yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu said that China still hopes that the Soviet Union and China can agree to China's compromise proposal for the Japanese peace conference, that is, the members of the Far Eastern Commission should convene the Japanese peace conference, and the four powers should retain the veto power over the resolution. The United States has not yet responded to China's proposal, and the Soviet Union has not made any new proposals to China recently. Gu said that if China's compromise proposal on the procedure of the Japanese peace conference cannot be accepted by the Soviet Union and the United States, then we will have to carefully consider our position. When asked by reporters, "If the above situation occurs, will China agree to the British and American proposal that all countries participating in the war against Japan can participate in the Japanese peace conference, and all resolutions will be voted on by a two-thirds majority without veto power?" Gu replied that the "results" of this resolution must be considered. This main result is bound to be hindered by the Soviet Union's obstruction of the peace conference procedure. China must carefully consider its resolution, "because we and the Soviet Union are neighbors."</p>
<h3>Soviet Consul in Peiping Denies Alliance Between Communists and Soviets</h3>
<p>[United Press Peiping, 17th] Soviet Consul in Peiping, Tie Weiqingsi, said on the night of the 16th that reports claiming that the Soviet Union had established a military agreement with the Chinese Communist Party were "nonsense."</p>
<p>It is claimed that: "We now recognize the National Government of China as the only government of China, so this agreement is impossible."</p>
<h3>Rice Purchase Agreement Between China and Siam Not Affected by Siamese Political Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the total amount of rice purchased in the rice purchase agreement between China and Siam is currently being drafted and handled by the China Trust Bureau. The payment of the price has been set at half in pounds and half in US dollars. The recent coup in Siam has no impact on this agreement.</p>
<h3>Armory Outside Xizhimen, Peiping, Explodes</h3>
<p>Sorting Scrap Metal, Landmines Explode [Our Dispatch, Peiping, 17th] The waste warehouse of the No. 219 Armory outside Xizhimen in Peiping suddenly exploded at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, shaking the entire city. Huo Jishi, the sub-supervisor of the 26th Garrison Station, went to investigate yesterday and said that the warehouse director Wang Wenxian was ordered to submit scrap metal. Yesterday at 3:00 p.m., he led warehouse staff Li Guorui and Sergeant Zhang Zhiru to sort it out in the warehouse. A waste landmine suddenly exploded, and Wang Wenxian and the other two died on the spot. The warehouse is far away from other armories, so fortunately it was not affected, but the glass of houses near Xizhimen was mostly shattered, and an old woman passing by was slightly injured.</p>
<p>Rumor of Fu Zuoyi Returning to Peiping from Tianjin</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Tianjin, 17th] Fu Zuoyi inspected the 92nd Army stationed in Tianjin at 7:00 a.m. on the 17th and summoned the officers to give a lecture for three hours. He then summoned senior officers for individual talks and had lunch at the military headquarters at noon. At 1:00 p.m., he inspected the defense works of Tianjin and left Tianjin at 3:10 p.m. to return to Peiping. Chen Jicheng came to Tianjin to meet with Fu and also left for Tangshan on the morning of the 17th with Luo Qi, the leader of the 4th War Zone Inspection Team.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Peiping, 17th] Fu Zuoyi returned to Peiping from Tianjin at 8:00 p.m. tonight and immediately responded to Li Zongren's banquet. Chu Xichun was also present, and it is said that they exchanged views on personnel matters in the Hebei Provincial Government. Fu will go to Chengde to inspect within a few days.</p>
<h3>Martial Law Begins in Shenyang Today, Bandit Troops Attempt to Break into Outer Perimeter Line, Major Battle May Occur Between Tieling and Faku</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Shenyang, 17th] The Shenyang Defense Command announced that martial law will begin on the 18th, prohibiting passage from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning. [Our Dispatch, Shenyang, 17th] The main force of the Communist bandits is now concentrating on the outer perimeter of Shenyang, attempting to break into the outer perimeter line to fight. The 1st, 2nd, and 7th Columns are scurrying around Tieling, Faku, and Xinmin, and the 6th Column also appears to be scurrying from Xi'an to Faku. More than 2,000 bandit Mongolian cavalry crossed the Liao River southward from the direction of Faku and destroyed the Shifosi on the south bank of Henan at night. This place is an important fortress in the north mountain area of Panyang, and the National Army is firmly defending it. Bandit crowds are also gathering in the Benxi and Fushun areas of southern Liaoning, and some are heading towards Liaoyang. According to the judgment of a certain military person in charge, a large-scale main battle may occur between Xinmin and Faku in ten days to two weeks. It is also said that the bandits' strategy this time will inevitably lead to a bad situation, because Shenyang has sufficient defensive and offensive power. Moreover, the bandits are scurrying around in this severe cold, and frostbite is inevitable, and their actions in the snow are even more restricted by aerial surveillance.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Transport Aircraft from the U.S. to be Formally Delivered Early Next Month, American Pilots Hired to Fly to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. War Assets Administration announced today that China has negotiated the purchase of 150 Curtis C-46 aircraft from the Foreign Surplus Property Clearing Office. Each of these aircraft has a volume of 2,600 cubic feet, a load capacity of 17,000 pounds, and a range of 1,500 miles. The original price was about 300,000 yuan per aircraft, but now the price is only 5,000 yuan per aircraft, plus 4,000 yuan for refurbishment, which China will take care of itself. The aircraft are scheduled to be formally delivered around January 1 next year, and China will hire American pilots to fly them to Shanghai. Most of them flew over the Hump during the war to transport supplies from India to China, and are now stored in the Warner warehouse in Arkansas.</p>
<h3>Scientific Instruments Among Japanese Reparations, China Can Obtain 1,500 Pieces, First Batch of Reparations to Arrive Next Month</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur Headquarters announced today that of the 3,000 pieces of scientific experimental instruments among the Japanese reparations, half are designated to be allocated to China, and the remaining half are allocated to the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. [Our Dispatch] The Japanese Reparations Supervision Committee invited representatives from relevant departments yesterday to hold the second liaison meeting. At the meeting, opinions were exchanged on the preparatory work for receiving materials and technical issues. The preparation of warehouses and wharves is currently underway. In order to strengthen the supervision, Hong Ruitao, director of the storage and transportation group of the Reparations Committee, has decided to come to Shanghai once a week in the future. The Haikang transport is scheduled to depart on the 23rd of this month to prepare to carry back 2,000 tons of materials, which are expected to return to the country around January 10 next year. The date of the second transport has not yet been determined. It is reported that among the first batch of materials to be loaded back, there are more than 200 pieces of machinery weighing more than 7 tons.

<h3>National Economic Commission to Formulate a Plan to Strengthen Control over Yarn and Cloth, Silk Spinning Association to Expand into Control Agency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th] The National Economic Commission has agreed on four key points for changing the management of yarn and cloth: Cotton yarn should adopt a full-scale spinning method, and the weaving section should be implemented immediately. The government must control raw materials. Domestic raw cotton should be grasped as much as possible. In addition to the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) raw cotton and the purchased foreign cotton, an appropriate portion of cotton yarn should be exported in exchange for foreign cotton. A planned allocation of yarn must be adopted for the cotton textile industry and the reproduction industry. The targets should be mainly the standard cloth for people's livelihood and the cotton textiles suitable for export. In order to implement the above principles, the existing Textile Industry Adjustment Committee will be reorganized into a control or management agency in order to strictly implement government policies. In addition, the existing Textile Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be reorganized into the National Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, which is expected to be completed before the end of the year. [Another telegram] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the amount of raw cotton currently controlled by the government is quite large. Combined with the cotton owned by various private and state-owned factories, it is more than enough to supply three months. As for cotton production, we have followed the planned plan and urged and promoted increased production in various cotton-producing areas. Once transportation is smooth and convenient, it will not be difficult to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Controlling Yarn and Cloth is to Safeguard the Interests of the People</h3>
<p>Dong Xian Guang Elaborates on the Government's Intention [Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th]</p>
<p>Director Dong Xianguang said at a press conference on the 17th that the National Economic Commission was ordered to formulate a plan to strengthen the government's management of yarn and cloth. The current Textile Industry Allocation Committee will be reorganized and expanded into the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, which will be established on New Year's Day next year. Yuan Liang will serve as the director of the committee. After the establishment of the new agency, yarn factories and weaving factories will produce for the government. The government guarantees that they will obtain reasonable profits in addition to paying for labor and other necessary expenses. The government will allocate cotton for spinning and weaving and will統購統銷统销（unified purchase and sale）. This is the general direction of the government's management. As for the goal of its implementation of management, it is not to establish a profit-making monopoly institution, but to safeguard the interests of the people and prevent speculation.

<h3>The Four Joint Offices to Hold a Board Meeting Today to Change Loan Policy, Reduce Domestic Exchange Rate, Discuss Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] Specific decisions on the loan issue of national banks and bureaus will be made on the morning of the 18th. The Four Joint Offices, which are responsible for reviewing loans, have decided to hold a meeting because of the suspension of loans last week. All directors will participate in the meeting at Guofu Bank at 8:00 a.m. on the 18th, and Chairman Chiang will personally preside over the meeting. The meeting will review past loan policies and decide on future loan directions. The Four Joint Offices held a preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 17th to prepare for the meeting on the morning of the 18th. It is heard that the loan policy will be changed, so [Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th] Supervisory Committee member Li Shijun proposed a suggestion on the 7th of this month, requesting the Executive Yuan to stop general commercial loans and to strictly verify the use of industrial or other production loans to prevent abuses and stabilize finance. It is reported that Li's proposal has two points: Except for the international trade products that are the main exports of the country, such as raw silk, tung oil, and tea, loans should be strictly granted in accordance with the regulations. All other general commercial loans should be stopped immediately to avoid misappropriation and hoarding, which would affect the market and fluctuate prices. The scope of loans that meet the nature of industry and production may be relaxed, and the procedures may be simplified as much as possible. However, the use, raw material use, finished product sales, and price regulations should be strictly controlled and carefully audited in terms of time to prevent hoarding and speculation. This case has been transferred to the Executive Yuan for review by the Control Yuan. [Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] Recently, the National Economic Commission had a resolution to "reduce the domestic exchange rate to decentralize funds." According to the Ministry of Finance, the purpose of adjusting the exchange rate is to make funds flow inward, avoiding their concentration in large cities, creating speculation, and stimulating prices. The Ministry of Finance is now discussing with the Four Joint Offices to broaden the implementation measures.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Deposits in the United States Evaded on a Large Scale Twice</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] According to a government official who recently returned from the United States, citizens' foreign exchange deposits in the United States have been evaded on a large scale, which is the inevitable result of the long delay in requisitioning or declaring citizens' deposits abroad. It is claimed that this evasion has occurred twice. The first time was when the United States unfroze foreign deposits in the United States. Because there were rumors of requisition in China, a batch had been evaded. After the measures for declaring foreign exchange deposits of citizens abroad were formulated, the second batch followed suit. The method of evasion was either to withdraw cash and transfer it to other countries, or to entrust foreign friends to deposit it under an assumed name. Those who entrusted foreigners to deposit even paid a commission, and the amount of the commission even exceeded the interest on the deposit. Therefore, there are very few Chinese deposits in the United States now.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>After seventeen sessions in Washington, the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers adjourned indefinitely on the 15th. Subsequently, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov promptly returned to Moscow, marking an unhappy end to the conference. The transmission of this news is unsurprising. When this Council of Foreign Ministers convened in Washington on the 25th of last month, we already held little optimism for its prospects. We pointed out that the main topics of this conference were the German and Austrian questions: Austria's independence and the peace treaty with Germany. The German peace treaty included issues such as reparations, how to revive the German economy, and the organization of the German government. At the foreign ministers' meeting, there was no time to discuss the political organization of Germany, and even the issue of reviving the German economy made no progress because the deadlock over reparations could not be broken. On the surface, at least, the failure of this Foreign Ministers' Conference was due to the deadlock on the reparations issue, which forced the announcement of an indefinite adjournment. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall proposed this, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault seconded it. At the final meeting on the 15th, Marshall bluntly stated that regarding the German reparations issue, "Only the Soviet Union firmly refuses to agree, so continuing the meeting is futile." British Foreign Secretary Bevin, after detailing his country's position, pointed out, "History will bear witness that we must now doubt whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can ultimately resolve the problems of Europe and Germany." At the same time, Molotov declared: "Bevin's and Marshall's actions are clearly identical. Both have failed to adhere to the agenda and have ignored Soviet proposals. The French delegation has never dissented from what the United States and Britain have said, showing that Britain and France have taken a united front against Soviet reparations." He also stated: "The American delegation did not come to this meeting in good faith, and it had already decided to break up the Foreign Ministers' Conference and divide Germany into two parts."</p>
<p>Regarding reparations, the Soviet Union sought reparations of US$10 billion, calculated at 1938 values, which would be far more than US$15 billion at current values. Marshall stated that this was clearly contrary to the Potsdam Agreement and, from the perspective of practical economic principles, was impossible. Under such demands, an agreement among the Four Powers could only be reached by agreeing to enslave the German people and severely hinder the reconstruction of all of Europe. Regarding the Austrian treaty, the property and privileges demanded by the Soviet Union far exceeded what a free and independent Austria could bear. The Soviet Union consistently refused to provide essential and necessary information on the transfer of German reparations materials and refused to agree to hand over German property unilaterally seized under the guise of reparations. The Soviet Union's actions prevent Germany from fulfilling its role in the task of rebuilding Europe, and force Britain and the United States to provide substantial aid to West Germany to maintain its survival. Unexpectedly, the Soviet representative blamed the British and American aid as an attempt to use West Germany as a strategic base against European democratic countries and to promote expansionist policies. Under these circumstances, the Foreign Ministers' Conference was forced to announce an indefinite adjournment. Of course, we hardly need to point out that the difference between the West, as it's called by Britain and the United States, and the Soviet Union, does not lie in the issue of reparations, but in the more fundamental issues behind these reparations; however, this difference is expressed through the issue of reparations.</p>
<p>Now that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has broken down and adjourned indefinitely, when it can be reopened is unknown. Judging from the existing signs, even if the Foreign Ministers' Conference does not die from this, reopening it seems to require a considerable amount of time. The trend of dividing Germany, Europe, and even the entire world into two is becoming more apparent, and the future of the world is increasingly volatile. According to reports, while the Western powers are not likely to take immediate action, the following developments are feared to be unavoidable: France is expected to agree to merge its German occupation zone economically with the Anglo-American zone; Britain, the United States, and France will discuss the possibility of politically unifying West Germany as soon as possible, which may result in the establishment of a temporary government for West Germany. We previously stated at the convening of the Western powers' foreign ministers' meeting: "If the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference cannot reach an agreement on the German and Austrian questions, the Iron Curtain of Eastern Europe will be lowered and become a new Great Wall, and the so-called two worlds will be more clearly manifested." Before returning home, they will confer with British and French representatives on how to take joint action to deal with the situation thereafter. If the current state of affairs continues to develop like this, the future is indeed worrying.</p>
<p>However, what deserves our attention even more is not the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference but the developments within the Soviet Union and the United States themselves. On the eve of the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet Union suddenly reformed its currency system. Currency reform itself does not necessarily have any extraneous meaning, but the timing of this Soviet currency reform and its inherent implications seem difficult to consider a normal reform. Reports from overseas have pointed out that this Soviet currency reform is aimed at establishing a ruble bloc to compete with the pound sterling area and the dollar bloc, and to facilitate competition with the Marshall Plan. At the same time, the special session of Congress convened by U.S. President Truman also passed a temporary emergency aid bill for China of $597 million. Although several specific issues regarding this temporary emergency bill have not been resolved, due to the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Congress, which will reconvene after the Christmas holidays, will strengthen and expedite its completion.</p>
<p>As the signs of division in the world become increasingly apparent, we, as an Eastern country, naturally feel particularly concerned about the subsequent changes in the world situation. What we must first point out here is that this is not a division between East and West. Although we are an Eastern country, our cultural tradition has always emphasized the concept of "all under heaven are one family." We will never align ourselves with the so-called Eastern world simply because we are located in the East to oppose the West. What we demand is "all under heaven are one family"; if the world is truly divided, that would be truly regrettable. We hope that the politicians of the world will remember the lessons of history, refrain from hasty accusations, and renew old friendships. In that case, even if there are temporary signs of division, it will not be difficult to find ways to remedy and reunite. If this can be achieved, mankind can avoid future calamities, and we hope that politicians can demonstrate their magnanimity!</p>
<h3>Purpose of Controlling Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Cotton and cotton cloth are among the most essential daily necessities for the people of our country, second only to food and fuel in importance. Therefore, the government has had to take control measures to stabilize the price of cotton textiles. The implementation of control will inevitably affect private textile businesses, but for the sake of urgent public welfare, this measure is indeed reasonable.</p>
<p>Our country has a population of 460 million, and the demand for cotton and cotton cloth is extremely large. If each of us needs an average of half a catty of cotton to make a cotton garment, then the country needs 2.3 million dan of cotton each year. Our textile industry has a total of 4.5 million spindles, of which 3.6 million are in operation, requiring a total of 10.8 million dan of cotton each year. In addition, the handicraft weaving industry needs another 2.5 million dan. Therefore, the total annual demand for raw cotton in our country is more than 13 million dan.</p>
<p>Since the victory, the government has spent huge amounts of foreign exchange to purchase foreign cotton. In 1946, domestic cotton production was 7.43 million dan, and imported foreign cotton, including that purchased by UNRRA, totaled 6.8 million dan. In 1947, cotton production increased by 50% compared to the previous year, and it is expected to increase further next year, but it will still be difficult to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Textile Industry Regulation Committee has been supplying cotton yarn to textile mills at official prices in order to stabilize the price of cotton textiles. Over the past two years, textile mills have made considerable profits, while the government has spent a lot of foreign exchange. However, due to the activities of speculators, the effort to stabilize cloth prices has not been effective.</p>
<p>After the implementation of emergency economic measures in February, speculation in gold and foreign currency was explicitly prohibited. Since July, the margin requirements for securities brokers on the Shanghai Stock Exchange have been increased, which has greatly reduced long positions in securities and stocks. Therefore, speculators in major cities such as Shanghai have focused on hoarding commodities. They use their large amounts of idle capital to speculate for profit, disrupting social stability, and cotton yarn and cloth often lead the rise in prices.</p>
<p>Based on this situation, the government has decided to restore the wartime control of cotton yarn and cloth in order to stabilize the price of cotton textiles and safeguard the welfare of the general public, so as to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji's Remains Placed in Coffin; To Be Buried at Hot Springs in Pingxi</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 17th dispatch] Zhang Ji's wife, Ms. Cui Zhenhua, flew to Beijing by military plane on the 17th to attend the funeral. According to people at the Zhang residence, Zhang's remains will be buried at the Xiangshan Hot Springs in Pingxi.</p>

<p>Madam Zhang Arrives in Beijing Yesterday; Speaks of Premonition Amidst Grief</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 17th dispatch] Ms. Cui Zhenhua, the wife of the late elder statesman Zhang Ji, accompanied by her niece and son-in-law, flew from Beiping to Beijing at 1:30 p.m. on the 17th and immediately went to the Zhang family hall at the Party History and Historical Materials Museum. When Madam Zhang saw Zhang's remains, she burst into tears. The reporter then visited Madam Zhang to express condolences. Amidst her grief, Madam Zhang recounted the premonition she had the previous night in Beiping, stating: She went to bed at nine o'clock that evening, but due to chronic insomnia, she was unable to sleep for a long time. She only heard the sounds of wind and rain and the very loud sounds of soldiers patrolling outside the door. Around eleven o'clock, she seemed to hear someone tapping on the window and throwing small brick fragments at the door. Madam Zhang did not pay attention to it, fearing that Beiping was not peaceful, and at the end of the year, when the weather was cold, petty thieves might visit. She then took a sleeping pill, but still could not fall asleep. Around one o'clock the next day, the knocking sound was repeated, but Madam Zhang still did not suspect anything. She then took another sleeping pill and did not fall asleep until three o'clock. Around four o'clock, she was awakened by someone, who said that there was a telegram from Nanjing. Madam Zhang immediately thought it was a telegram from Zhang, informing her of his travel dates, because Zhang had planned to return to Beiping within a few days. However, the telegram was the opposite of what she expected; it reported that Zhang was critically ill. After reading the telegram, Madam Zhang believed that it must be a serious illness and immediately instructed someone to notify the airline and friends to purchase tickets for the next day. However, due to the weather in Beiping, it was postponed until the 17th that she was able to arrive in Beijing. Madam Zhang also told reporters that when Zhang's mother gave birth to Zhang, it was a stormy night. However, after Zhang's birth, the wind and rain subsided. Zhang's mother once told people that Zhang would have a bad temper. Unexpectedly, Zhang's death also occurred on a night of rain and snow. He came in the wind and rain and left in the wind and rain, which is extremely saddening. Madam also stated: She herself has been suffering from insomnia. When Zhang returned late, he would often gently tap on her window, just like what she heard in Beiping. However, her husband would say whether it was a spirit or not, it seemed that Zhang still remembered her insomnia before his death.</p>

The market price of rice in Hangzhou is currently 840,000 per picul, while the cost of shipping white rice from the producing areas has reached 900,000, so the rice market is still hovering around 950,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th dispatch] Commodity prices in Zhenjiang had stabilized slightly in the past two days due to the tightening of the money supply in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places.

<h3>Deng Wenyi Reports on a Week of War Situation: Bandits Prepare for Spring Offensive, and Announces the Strength of Bandit Troops on Both Sides of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 17th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the war situation of the past week on the 17th, stating: "Judging from the situation of the past week, it can be seen that the communist bandits are preparing for a spring offensive in March next year. Because the weather is gradually getting colder, it is not suitable for military operations, but when spring comes, the communist bandits will definitely launch a large-scale offensive." In response to reporters' inquiries about the strength of the communist bandits on both sides of the Pinghan Railway, it was stated that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have a total of six columns, about 78,000 people. The bandit army suffered more than 10,000 casualties in the Liulin battle, and now has less than 70,000 people, with more than 10,000 on the west side of the Pinghan Railway and more than 50,000 on the east side; Chen Yi's bandit troops have a total of about 80,000 people, with a total of 60,000 people in the triangle area of Lanfeng, Zhengzhou, and Xuchang, and more than 20,000 people north of the Longhai Railway; Chen Geng's troops have a total of more than 40,000 people, with 5,000 people in Liulin to support Liu Bocheng's bandit troops, and 10,000 people in Luohe. It is estimated that there are a total of 120,000 people east of Pinghan and south of the sea. Deng refused to announce the strength of the National Army in the area, but said that the strength of the National Army is strong, and the number should be between one and two times that of the communist bandits.</p>
<p>Deng reported on the week's battle situation from the 9th to the 16th of this month, stating:</p>
<p>Great Victory in the Dabie Mountains</p>
<p>The National Army advancing into the Dabie Mountains has achieved a great strategic victory. The bandit leader Liu Bocheng drove more than 70,000 people from his 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 12th columns, dreaming of establishing a so-called "Central Plains Field Army base" in the Dabie Mountains, preparing to invade south of the Yangtze River next year. They were surrounded and annihilated by the National Army. In just two or three days from the 7th to the 9th of this month, more than 10,000 people from Liu's 10th and 12th columns were annihilated at the western end of Liulin Station. This forced Liu Bocheng to try his best to break through, seeking to get his main force out of the encirclement of the Dabie Mountains; at the same time, he still used a part of his forces to circle around in the Dabie Mountains, reluctant to leave his newly built nest of the past three months. Since the 11th, Liu's 10th and 12th columns have crossed the Pinghan Railway twice, following the path of Li Xiannian last year, and突個to the west. Part of them were attacked by the National Army one after another, and then shrank back to the Daxindian and Jinlongshan area on the east side of the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>Liu's Dream Completely Shattered</p>
<p>Liu's bandits were unable to break out of the encirclement with their main force to the west, so they changed the direction of their escape. On the evening of the 14th, they fled northeast in two groups, passing near Baiquanyuan in Fubei, and between Zhaihe and Huangchuan. They have now fled to the vicinity of Baozikou and Dufu store, but they have been attacked by the National Army along the way, and another two or three thousand horses have been killed or injured. The 2nd Column, which fled to the vicinity of Gushi, originally wanted to use the tactic of "big eats small" to attack the small number of defending troops in Gushi, in an attempt to retaliate for the frustration of being driven out of the Dabie Mountains by the National Army. However, because of the "skillful application of the National Army's strategy and tactics, beyond the expectations of the bandit army; during the period when the westward-窜bandit army was being annihilated in a grand and fierce manner west of Liulin Station, there was an unexpected fresh force,追擊the 2nd Column of bandits from the尾後. After being pressured and severely damaged, the 2nd Column of bandits had no choice but to竄to Sanhejian in the north. In order to rescue the bandit army besieged in the Dabie Mountains area, they竄again from Sanhejian to Yangliudian west of Liu'an on the 11th, and were again surrounded and attacked by the National Army, with more than 500 people killed or injured, fleeing southeast in embarrassment. At present, the National Army is still encircling and suppressing them on all sides, and Liu's dream of establishing a base in the Dabie Mountains is about to be shattered.</p>
<p>The Bandits in Western Henan are Bluffing</p>
<p>As for Chen Geng's troops in Western Henan, after being attacked by the Henan Security Corps at Xixiakou last week, the news that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops were besieged in the Dabie Mountains made him panic. He hurriedly sent the 9th Column from Fangcheng, south of the Funiu Mountains, to the vicinity of Tongbai to meet the remnants of the 12th Column. Another group of more than 5,000 people, in order to rescue Liu's bandits from breaking through, pretended to be bluffing. It is estimated that on the 14th, they passed through Minggang and Zhen from Fangcheng to the vicinity of Luohe on the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>The National Army in Eastern Henan Attacks the Bandits on Three Sides</p>
<p>Chen Yi's bandit troops in eastern Henan saw that the bandit's new base in the Dabie Mountains was being encircled and annihilated, and wanted to implement "besiege Wei to rescue Zhao". They gathered the 8th Column from western Shandong and竄south across the Longhai Railway on the 9th, combining the forces of five columns including the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th, totaling 80,000 people, and advanced and retreated in the Chenliu, Weishi, Huyong, Changge, and Fugou areas, attempting to攻打Kaifeng and Zhengzhou in an attempt to contain the National Army's forces and reduce the danger of Liu Bocheng being besieged. The National Army, aware of their treachery, is encircling and suppressing them on three sides, from east to west, from north to south, and from west to east.</p>
<p>The Northeast Bandit Army is Exhausted</p>
<p>In the northeast, the bandit army has recently made slight movements again. In mid-December, the bandit army's 7th Column竄from Tongliao to the mountainous area near Zhangwu Fakuking, and the bandit army's 8th Column under Li Yunchang also竄east from the Yebaishou Lingyuan area to the Ershijiazi Yangshan area west of Jinzhou, and destroyed a section of the Beining Railway west of Jinxi; however, in the extremely cold northeast, the bandit army's ambition is greater than its ability, and this kind of action is only to make up for the failure of the bandit's so-called "general counter-offensive."</p>

<h3>The Question of the Merger of the Three Western Occupation Zones of Germany will be Negotiated in Washington Next Spring; Marshall Leaves London this Morning to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Report from our agency] New York, 17th Broadcast: Washington News, the State Department announced that Marshall will broadcast to the nation at 10 pm on Friday about the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Mr. Marshall is scheduled to return home on Friday morning.</p>
<p>[Report from our agency] London, 17th Broadcast: It is learned that the United States, Britain, and France may hold a meeting in Washington soon to discuss the merger of the western occupation zones of Germany. Bidault has apparently expressed his agreement to this meeting. This morning, British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Bidault, mainly to discuss the German issue. At noon, Marshall went to Buckingham Palace to dine with the King and Queen of England. 、</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] It is learned that the United States and France have temporarily agreed that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will hold a meeting in Washington on January 15th next year to discuss the organization of West Germany, but they still hope to cooperate with the Soviet Union. According to French sources, US Secretary of State Marshall had preliminary contact with French Foreign Minister Bidault last night, and the result was satisfactory. Marshall and Bidault also agreed to talk with British Foreign Secretary Bevin before leaving for home. Bidault is scheduled to return to Paris tonight. Since the London Foreign Ministers Conference has broken down, the parties concerned are now intensifying their focus on the subsequent issues, on the one hand, planning to integrate West Germany into the Marshall Plan, and on the other hand, still hoping that the Soviet Union will participate, but this will depend on the Soviet Union's ability.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] According to officials of this mission, the merger of the three western occupation zones of Germany by the United States, Britain, and France has not yet been completed quickly. The Western countries still need to have "long-term and difficult discussions" on the issue of economic or political unification of West Germany. However, informal negotiations on this issue have already begun, and formal negotiations are expected to begin early next year. American people who are most familiar with the situation in Germany are not very optimistic about the early establishment of the "three-zone" Germany. They are quite concerned about the difficulties that French public opinion has given to the French government. In fact, some American officials who implement American policy in Germany all advocate the merger with the French occupation zone, at least until after next spring. They pointed out that the participation of France in the merger of the British and American occupation zones, in addition to showing the strong unity of the West, has no other immediate benefits. Because France fears the threat of a powerful new Germany to its security, France's participation in the merger may instead delay the economic progress that helps the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] According to well-informed sources, Marshall outlined to Bidault last night the US outline for the occupation zone merger plan, with France participating in the management of the Ruhr area, but on the basis of majority voting, and not exercising veto power. As for France's request to set up another government in the Rhine River basin, the US side believes that this is not necessary during the period when there is a military government in Germany, and should be put aside for future discussion.</p>
<h3>The British Government will Re-examine its German Policy; Bevin Severely Criticizes the Soviet Union for Seizing Materials in German Territory</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Government officials said today that the British Cabinet may consider a comprehensive foreign policy tomorrow. At that time, Foreign Secretary Bevin will report on the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and then begin to discuss the direction that Britain should take in the future. The result of the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers Conference has caused serious concern among officials. Britain will join the United States in urging France to participate in the merger of the occupied territories in Germany, and strive to improve German industrial production and work for European reconstruction.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin issued a statement after the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference, accusing the Soviet Union of dismantling all German railway lines, public utilities, and factories, and placing them under military management to rule the economic life of Germany. Unless the Soviet Union makes these facts public, it cannot seriously discuss the issue of compensation. Bevin estimated that 70 percent of the production in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany was either shipped to the Soviet Union in disregard of the Potsdam Agreement, or consumed by Soviet troops stationed there.</p>
<p>Bevin also stated that all exports from the British and American zones of Germany, including coal and wood, were converted at world market prices, and the foreign exchange obtained was used to import raw materials and other necessities, so that the German industrial economy could operate. Therefore, Molotov's claim that Britain and the United States were making huge profits from German exports was completely unfounded. Bevin also said that the authorities in the British and American zones were willing to dismantle and ship the factories listed in the recently announced compensation plan as quickly as possible. The Soviet delegation had never been able to point out which article of the Potsdam Agreement they were based on in demanding compensation in the form of German production. Bevin's statement has been distributed to the US, French, and Soviet delegations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] The US-British Joint Military Government recently announced that 22 German war equipment factories, originally scheduled to be dismantled as compensation, will be fully retained at the request of the Germans.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Shows Concessions on the Issue of German Assets in Austria; Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Meet to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers are scheduled to meet in London today to discuss the Soviet Union's new concessions on the issue of German assets in Austria. The concession was announced by the Soviet representative shortly before the adjournment of the current Foreign Ministers Conference. The content is to reduce the Soviet Union's previous request to obtain 90 percent of Austria's eastern oil rights to two-thirds. However, the compromise proposal put forward by France only suggested giving one-third of the oil rights to the Soviet Union. The names of the representatives of the four foreign ministers are as follows: Marjorie Minck of the United Kingdom, Léan of France, Dujay of the United States, and Kotimov of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>The United States Bears Three-Quarters of the Expenses of the British and American Zones in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Officials announced that the United States and Britain have temporarily agreed that the United States will bear 75 percent of the expenses of the British and American occupation zones, and Britain will grant the United States the power to manage German financial and trade institutions as compensation.</p>
<h3>West Germany's Capital Planned to be Located in Frankfurt</h3>
<p>General Clay Made This Plan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Gropius, Director of the Department of Architecture at Harvard University, revealed today that as early as four months before the London Conference of Foreign Ministers announced its breakdown yesterday, General Clay, the US Governor of Germany, advocated drafting a plan to make Frankfurt the capital of West Germany, which is formed by the three occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France. Clay's was based on the assumption that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference would fail.</p>
<h3>Germans in the Soviet Occupation Zone Protest Attempts to Divide Germany</h3>
<p>[Report from our agency] London, 17th Broadcast: Berlin News, the Communist Party of Eastern Germany today issued a telegram to political figures in the four occupation zones, protesting against the plan to merge the economies of Western Germany, and opposing any attempt to divide Germany. German political figures in the British and American occupation zones of Germany announced the formation of a draft for Western Germany to compete with the communist forces in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The Soviet official newspaper in Germany believes that the merger of the British and American occupation zones has an imperialist nature.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's New Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, Arrives in Washington</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Soviet Union's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, arrived here last night from Yingsko. According to reports, Pan was the former Soviet ambassador to China.</p>
<h3>The United States Forms a Customs Union with Britain, France, Belgium, etc.; the United States will Reduce Import Taxes Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman today ordered that, starting on January 1 next year, import tax rates will be reduced in accordance with the Geneva International Trade Agreement, but only on the condition that the countries concerned reduce taxes at the same time. The countries that have signed this trade agreement with the United States include Australia, Canada, Britain, France, and the Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg Customs Union.</p>
<h3>Attempting to Disrupt the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union will Launch an Offensive, Expected to Target France Primarily</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Well-informed sources in France believe that after the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union will launch an offensive against the Marshall Plan, and will primarily target France. It is worth noting that the French Communist Party is now launching propaganda in rural areas to undermine Finance Minister Mey Chan's reconstruction plan.</p>
<p>The main points of these plans include increasing taxes on farmers and increasing tariffs in order to suppress agricultural product prices. Moscow's making Eastern European countries sacrifice their pre-war trade relations with the West and establishing a close offensive with the Soviet economy is part of its anti-Marshall Plan policy. The authorities especially pay attention to the recent trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, which makes Czechoslovakia's steel industry closely match the Soviet Union's needs in the next five years. Well-informed sources also said that the Soviet Union is determined to adapt to the needs of the Soviet Union, and not the general industrial capacity of Czechoslovakia itself, which will be affected as a result. For example, the Soviet Union requires Czechoslovakia to supply 150,000 tons of steel pipes for the Soviet oil industry. A natural rise in prices and competition between government price suppression measures will take place in France in the coming months. The reasons for the natural rise in prices include the natural lack of winter and the loss of coal due to labor unrest. The French Communist Party's plan to disrupt the Marshall Plan is also expected to be intensified in these months.</p>
<h3>Italy Obtains a Share of the Gold Plundered by Germany During the War; the Four Powers Allow Italy to Demolish Submarines for Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] According to an appendix signed at the British Foreign Office today, Italy can also obtain a share of the gold looted by Germany. The signatories include US Ambassador to Britain Douglas, representing the United States, Foreign Minister Wen, representing Britain, Ambassador Massigli, representing France, and Ambassador Scotti, representing France.</p>
<p>Italy must also prove its claim of 69 tons of gold to the British, American, and French Committee in Brussels. The British Foreign Office also stated that 2,300 kilograms of gold must be deposited in the governments of the United States, Britain, and France under Italy's share. This number is equal to the gold that France and Yugoslavia obtained from Italy under the Treaty of Italy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] In a surprising move today, the Soviet Union joined the other three powers in allowing Italy to obtain scrap iron and machinery from 31 submarines. According to the treaty, these submarines should be sunk at midnight.</p>
<h3>Italian General Election Postponed</h3>
<p>Gasperi will deliver a speech to Congress</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 16th] The Italian Cabinet decided today to postpone the general election originally scheduled for March 7 to between April 4 and April 18. The Cabinet also approved Gasperi's speech to Congress, in which he promised that the government would cooperate with democratic parties to ensure the greatest possible electoral freedom.</p>
<h3>British and American Troops Withdraw from Hungary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 16th] A government spokesman said: All British and American troops stationed in the camp withdrew from the country yesterday in accordance with the deadline stipulated in the peace treaty. The spokesperson declined to comment on the Soviet troops. When asked about the right of American aircraft to land at Hungarian airports, he replied that this matter should be resolved on a reciprocal basis.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai will Fly from Hong Kong to London</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 17th] It was reported today that Emperor Bao Dai of Annam is scheduled to fly to London by British aircraft on Saturday to discuss the issue of Vietnamese independence with the French side.</p>
<h3>Dutch Prime Minister Arrives in Batavia</h3>
<p>Seeking to Resolve the Organization of the Indonesian Federation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 17th] Dutch Prime Minister Bier flew from the Netherlands to here this morning. When the special plane he was riding in approached Batavia, it was escorted by four马式fighter planes. The entrance and interior of the airport were guarded by Dutch police. The purpose of his visit is to resolve several needs and to speed up the organization of the federation for the restoration of Indonesia.</p>
<h3>The United Nations Committee Passes the Declaration of Human Rights</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 16th] The United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with the participation of 18 countries, today passed the Declaration of Human Rights. Soviet representative Watagumo expressed that the provisions of the case were not detailed enough, so he reserved the right to propose a Soviet-recommended human rights bill next year. This Declaration of Human Rights is the first part of the International Bill of Human Rights. It was passed by a vote of 13 to 0. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, and Yugoslavia all abstained.</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude is Becoming Increasingly Arrogant; Rumors that it will Propose to the Peace Conference to Revoke Administrative Control and Retain Various Islands such as Ryukyu and the Kuril Islands</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] This question of the Japanese newspaper Jiji Shinpo and Asahi Shimbun, etc., on the 11th of this month, all published a piece of news in an important position in the American World Weekly, publishing a secret Japanese document. It is said that the content is the proposal that Japan intends to submit to the United Nations Peace Conference on Japan, but the weekly did not name who or what agency drafted it, only saying that the Japanese side hopes to submit it to the Peace Conference on Japan when the opportunity arises. It is said that its main points are as follows: After the signing of the Peace Treaty with Japan, the United Nations' management of Japan should be limited to the minimum. It is necessary to avoid implementing the Peace Treaty with Japan by institutions like the current United Nations control of Japanese institutions. The United Nations' management agency for Japan should only consist of the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union. The above-mentioned United Nations ambassadorial delegation should be given the authority to directly interfere in Japanese administration. After a certain period, after the above-mentioned management agency is revoked, if disputes related to the implementation of the Peace Treaty with Japan occur, they should be subject to the decision of the International Court of Justice. Currently, except for military industries, all production should not be restricted. We should try our best to limit the dismantling of production plants due to compensation. Japanese merchant ships should be allowed to expand to 4 million tons. Japan is proud to have no objection to giving up the privileges and extraterritorial rights enjoyed in China before the war, as well as the mandate of the Caroline, Mariana, Marshall, and Palau Islands, but should strive to preserve the Kuril Islands. Xiao　原, Ryukyu, and other Pacific islands and small islands near the Japanese mainland (or even including Sulfur Island) Jiji Shinpo also commented on this matter in an editorial on the same day. Finally, it hopes that the contradictions between the major powers can be resolved as soon as possible, and should not make the Peace Treaty with Japan fall into the same fate as the Peace Treaty with Germany and Austria.</p>
<h3>France Tries to Recover from the Crisis (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Our Paris Correspondent, Yi Ruo</p>
<p>[Our Paris Dispatch] The air of November 19th was especially stifling and oppressive in France, with the striking masses becoming even more clamorous.</p>
<p>That evening, after the President of France accepted Ramadier's resignation, he immediately authorized Léon Blum, the leader of the Socialist Party, to form a cabinet. Fortunately, Blum had already begun a week of consultations, exchanging opinions for a week, and believed that with one final push, he could secure the nine votes needed from the Third Force coalition to form a government with ample support. After thirty-six hours of effort, yesterday (the 21st) afternoon, Blum entered the National Assembly hall, and under the chairmanship of Herriot, announced his policy platform to the 601 members of parliament. From the outset, he expressed his dual opposition to communism and de Gaulle, making any votes from those factions hopeless. He then discussed his economic policies, which he considered "correct," but which were so vague and elusive that they aroused suspicion among the Radical Socialist parliamentarians. He then addressed the issue of overseas territories, but his consistent advocacy for reconciliation with Annam could not please the right-wing minority, undoubtedly losing him a portion of the vote. He requested a vote of confidence from the parliament for his cabinet formation, and the results were revealed late at 11 p.m. A total of 277 voted against him, with 24 abstentions, and only 300 votes in favor—exactly the same number of votes of confidence that Ramadier had received in his last vote. Ramadier managed to linger for some time with that support, but Blum failed to achieve success. According to the constitution, "a vote of confidence for cabinet formation must receive an absolute majority of the parliamentary seats (including those absent), i.e., 309 votes. Once in power, an absolute majority of opposition is required for removal." Therefore, Ramadier could continue to hold on with those 300 votes, but Blum could not come to power with them. Newspapers in Britain, the United States, Russia, and Italy were unaware of the situation, panicking and making a fuss.</p>
<p>From that moment on, Blum lost his personal authority, and the Socialist Party lost its central role in the government. The Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, walked out of the parliament hall dejectedly, saying: "Everyone put in a lot of effort. Blum still failed. Blum himself messed it up, so who can be blamed?" General public opinion believed that the Radical Socialists' dissatisfaction with other economic policies was a major fatal blow, otherwise there would not have been so many as 24 abstentions. The missing nine votes could certainly have been found in that area. The parliamentary spokesman for the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), Lecourt, felt that the Socialist leader could not distinguish between urgent and non-urgent matters, and his methods were not smooth.</p>
<p>Blum failed, and he reported to the President that night. The Third Force coalition also died with his failure.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>President Auriol woke up this morning, considering that Blum's failure was due to the abstentions of the Radical Socialist parliamentarians. Why not ask a Radical Socialist member to try? At 10:00 a.m., he first invited the party's Minister of Justice to assume the premiership, but he declined. At 10:15 a.m., he also invited the party's Minister without Portfolio to take the job, but he also declined, both citing poor health as excuses, but in reality, they were worried that the Socialists might retaliate, making the effort futile. It was not until 11:15 a.m. that they found the MRP's Minister of Finance, Schuman, who was willing to give it a try. He immediately began contacting various parties, and by 6:00 p.m., everything was settled. It only took him seven hours, less than one-fifth of the time Blum had taken. Schuman went to the National Assembly and announced his policy platform to the assembly.</p>
<p>In the hall, only the Communist Party spokesman rose to argue, believing that his policies were not thorough enough, especially since he had served as a deputy minister in the Pétain government that surrendered to the enemy (from June to July 1940). As Minister of Finance in the Ramadier cabinet, he focused on exploiting the common people, and he would inevitably continue down Ramadier's old path, so they would definitely not vote for confidence. The Socialist Party thought that the MRP had helped the Socialist Party leader a great deal last night, so now that the MRP's Schuman was taking the stage, they would naturally reciprocate the courtesy, without saying much, and give him a vote of confidence. The MRP was Schuman's own party, so that goes without saying. The other parties felt that Schuman had been clean and fair in his conduct during his tenure, so there was no need to speak, and they gave him a vote of confidence. As for de Gaulle's faction of more than 70 seats, since Schuman had not been as straightforward as Blum in attacking the right wing, and he was about to be invited into the cabinet, they did not oppose him much.</p>
<p>At 9:00 p.m., the vote was revealed. Schuman received 412 votes of confidence, 112 more than Blum, and 103 more than the absolute majority required by the constitution (309 votes)! Only the Communist Party's 184 votes were against confidence, but that did not matter much. Schuman immediately began planning the selection of cabinet members, first consulting with the responsible personnel of his own party. At 10:15 p.m., he met with representatives of the Socialist Party, and at 11:00 p.m., he met with representatives of the Radical Socialist Party. By 1:00 a.m., the new cabinet members had not yet been decided.</p>
<p>According to general observation, whether Schuman can form a stable cabinet is highly questionable, because the MRP was the party that suffered the most disastrous defeat in the October election. This time, they were fortunate to have the Socialists yield the way and be in a position where the two major forces on the left and right were incompatible, so that Schuman could be entrusted with the important task. The constitution clearly stipulates that there cannot be two successive cabinet crises within the first 18 months of each National Assembly, otherwise the parliament will be dissolved, and the government will be temporarily managed by the Speaker along with representatives of each party. The intention is to eliminate the abuses of frequent cabinet crises that occurred in the Third Republic era. The current National Assembly has not yet reached a year. If Schuman cannot maintain his position until next June, then the parliament will be dissolved and a new election will be held. This is what de Gaulle has been constantly hoping for, and the Third Force's foundation will be further divided by the left and right factions. The French right-wing public opinion is already concerned about this. Moreover, if there is no one in the government, Speaker Herriot will temporarily serve as prime minister. Herriot himself is extremely opposed to personal dictators, and he is over 70 years old. Once he is no longer able to continue, he will be replaced by the Vice Speaker, the Communist Party's Duclos, which is even more feared by the right wing. Therefore, Schuman's own political skills may not be as good as Ramadier's, but due to the prevailing circumstances, his new cabinet has a reason to be realized.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>At this moment, the labor unrest is surging, and there is an unstoppable trend, and society is showing instability. On the morning when Ramadier had not yet resigned (the 19th), there were 300,000 people on strike in northern France and Paris-Marseille. The next day, there were 5 million people, and the third day, there were 7 million people. The importance of this can be imagined. The scope of the strike has expanded from Paris to all parts of the country, which is much more dangerous than the chain strikes in May and June. Six of the seven railway stations in Paris went on strike one after another starting yesterday morning, virtually isolating the city from the outside world. The ironworkers in the suburbs of Paris are completely on strike. The coal mines in northern France can produce 100,000 tons of coal per day, but now they cannot even mine 6,000 tons. Iron mines have also been drawn into the vortex. Elementary school teachers in the Seine province and Paris are all working slowly. Five major ports in France—Marseille, Rouen, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Le Havre—the first four have completely gone on strike, and the last one will take the same action next Monday. The French local authorities have tried to use the army to replace them, but this has been rejected by the Marseille navy. The British and American navies docked in the harbor are also taking a sympathetic attitude. The American Empire State has sent a telegram to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to express its opposition to breaking strike discipline. In addition, some of the female tailors in Paris are also on strike. Bricklayers across the country are scheduled to strike next Monday. Civil servants are also preparing to take action. Post office drivers and workers have decided to strike (there may be major changes by the time this article arrives). There are still countless others who are ready to move. The main reason is that the price of goods and wages are too disparate.</p>
<p>Starting next week, the fares for the two major means of transportation in Paris—the subway and the bus—will increase by 25% simultaneously.</p>
<p>As the former Minister of Finance, how Schuman will save the current situation in France, maintain the value of the franc, and adjust wages and prices will be the touchstone of how long his cabinet will last. If he can achieve this, although he is not the savior of France, he is the benefactor of millions of ordinary people (Paris, November 22).</p>
<h3>Grand Midnight Gala at the Great Light Theater: Competing to Purchase Charity Premiere Tickets to Benefit 300,000 Refugees; Enthusiastic Atmosphere among Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries under the Mercury Lights</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The honor tickets for the charity premiere of a Western film to raise funds for the Winter Relief Association were sold at the Great Light Theater last night. At the same time, previews of nine charity premiere Western films and the comedy "The Goddaughter" were screened. Many prominent figures and celebrities from the city were invited to attend.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the event, nine trailers were screened. After the trailers, the mayor took the stage to address the audience. He first expressed his gratitude to the guests for attending the event. Then, he cited the Bible, saying: "God blesses those who give, and also blesses those who receive. It is a blessing to receive, and it is also a blessing to give." He explained that there are 300,000 refugees in the city who need relief, 200,000 of whom come from all over, and 100,000 of whom are native to the city. For the sake of public security and our own safety, we should provide assistance to them. Otherwise, when they are starving and cold, they will inevitably take desperate risks. The mayor further stated: "Thanks to everyone's generous donations, all 1,400 tickets have now been sold out. Thank you very much." The mayor then thanked the foreign donors in English, and expressed his sincere gratitude to the nine Western film merchants, the nine cinemas that assisted with the charity premiere, and the companies and individuals who contributed in advertising, general affairs, reception, and other aspects. Then, the auction of the honor tickets began.</p>
<p>The honor tickets were auctioned by Xu Zhendong, the manager of the New China Bank, under the direction of Mr. Helmick, the former American judge in China. The two took the stage, each holding a small hammer for the auction. Mr. Xu first explained: "Because there is still a shortage of 4 billion in funds, we have decided to raise funds through auction. Each theater has two best seats, and we will auction these two seats as a group, and we hope everyone will actively bid."</p>
<p>The auction began, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. Whenever someone bid, the strong mercury light on the stage shone directly on them, instantly becoming the focus of attention for the entire venue. A total of five groups of ten honor tickets were auctioned in five rounds. The results were as follows: The first group was jointly purchased by nine film companies for 100 million yuan, and then transferred to the mayor and his wife. The second group was won by Yao Naizhi, the manager of the China Cement Company, also for 100 million yuan. The third group was purchased by Rong Hongyuan of the Shenxin Textile Company for 110 million yuan. The fourth group was purchased by George Hatem for 130 million yuan. The fifth group was purchased by the Guo Li'an brothers of the Wing On Company, also for 130 million yuan. After the auction, the comedy film "The Goddaughter" was screened. The event did not end until midnight.</p>

<h3>Mayor Convenes Grain Merchants for Discussions; Assistance Promised for Transport Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the rising price of rice transported from Japan, which has been stirring up public sentiment, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with rice merchants yesterday at 10:00 AM. Representatives attending from the South Market included Yin Fuxiang, Hu Wen'an, Hu Xiangang, and from the North Market, Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Cai Shengming, Gu Yisheng, totaling seven individuals. Ji Mingzhai, the head of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, was also present. Mayor Wu inquired in detail about the conditions at the source of production, expressing his hope that the market would not experience fluctuations, so as not to agitate the public and affect other commodity prices. He assured the merchants that if they encountered any difficulties, the government would do its utmost to assist in resolving them as quickly as possible. The representatives then explained the reasons for the decrease in supply and the high prices at the production areas, believing that the high prices in the producing regions and the difficulties in transportation made it impossible for rice merchants to maintain their costs. They suggested that the fundamental solution was to find ways to suppress prices in the producing areas and facilitate the flow of supplies. Mayor Wu then stated that he had already consulted with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation and Director Chen of the two railway bureaus, and that at least 1,000 tons of grain would be transported to Shanghai daily via the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. This has already begun. In addition, the city government is also in contact with the National Association of Shipping Companies and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to prioritize the transport of grain by waterways.</p>
<h3>Mistress's Heart Changes, Methods Cruel: Paramour Savagely Beaten and Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Yuting began cohabiting with the young woman Mu Huiqin in November of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. Wang even purchased a house for Mu on Liyuan Road in the South City, which Mu rented out as pocket money. In August of this year [1948], Mu became involved with a man named Wu Zhenjiang. She absconded with valuables from the house and cohabited with Wu at No. 1 Lujia Street on Xujiahui Road. When Wang discovered this, he went to the address and apprehended both Wu and Mu, sending them to the police station for processing. However, the police station declined to handle the case, as the two were not legally married, and advised them to settle the matter privately. Not only were Wu and Mu unwilling to reconcile, but they also claimed that the house on Liyuan Road in the South City belonged to Mu. They bribed gangsters to vandalize the property on the fourth of this month and severely beat Wang, causing permanent injuries. After investigating the case, the Lujiawan Police Station transferred it to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The victim, Wang Yuting, has also submitted a petition to the District Procuratorate requesting that the matter be handled according to the law.</p>

<h3>Heated Debate at Labor-Management Arbitration Board: Temporary Employee Hiring Procedures Determined</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Board held its 15th meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. The main topic of discussion was the proposal for restricting the employment of temporary workers in various factories. Attendance and observers were numerous, and some workers even waited outside the venue to hear the results of the discussion. Wu Kaixian presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>First Use of Voting Method</p>
<p>During the discussion, representatives from the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union held differing views on the proposal for restricting the employment of temporary workers, leading to intense debate. Subsequently, a vote was taken, and the proposal for restricting the employment of temporary workers in various factories was amended and passed by a vote of six to five. This was the first time that a vote had been used to decide a proposal since the establishment of the Labor-Management Arbitration Board. The content of the passed proposal is as follows: Factories employing temporary workers should not exceed 10% of the total number of workers in the factory, in accordance with the regulations stipulated in Order No. 118472, General Affairs Section 2, issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs on January 10, 1946. If the work of a temporary worker is indeed temporary and there is no need for continued employment, the worker may be dismissed upon the expiration of the work contract. If the work of a temporary worker is not temporary and there is a possibility or necessity for continued employment, the worker should be converted into a regular employee after working for three months. According to item 3, after a temporary worker is converted into a regular employee, if the employer must partially dismiss workers due to a business downturn and reduced workload, workers with shorter seniority and poorer skills should be dismissed first. If there is a labor-management dispute, it should be reported to the competent authority for verification.</p>
<h3>Index Discount for Letterpress Printing Industry: Resolution of Dispute Determined</h3>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, the dispute between labor and management in the city's letterpress printing industry over the cost-of-living index discount was also discussed. The resolution was determined as follows: If the cost-of-living allowance for workers' families in various companies and factories is fully paid at 13.5 yuan, it will be calculated based on a 90% discount of the cost-of-living index announced by the city government. If various companies and factories do not have a cost-of-living allowance for workers' families, it will be calculated based on a 95% discount of the cost-of-living index announced by the city government. Furthermore, if various companies and factories have a cost-of-living allowance for workers' families, but the amount is less than 13.5 yuan, it may be calculated proportionally using this discount method (from 90% to 95%). The aforementioned discount shall be from November 1, 1947, to December 31, 1947. From January 1, 1948, in addition to complying with government-stipulated discounts, no further discounts will be given for the cost-of-living index. Regarding the above three items, if various companies and factories are indeed unable to bear the cost due to a business downturn, labor and management may negotiate and determine a discount method separately. The remaining matters shall be handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated in Order No. 218, City Evaluation Secretary (36), issued by this committee on July 12, 1947.</p>
<h3>Ensuring Security on Both Railways: Winter Defense Implemented Along the Lines</h3>

<h3>Zhou Xiangyun's Estate Causes Dispute Over School Establishment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Estate disputes are commonplace in Shanghai, mostly arising from conflicts of interest among heirs. However, a recent estate dispute concerns the establishment of a university, differing from ordinary cases.</p>
<p>The late Ningbo merchant Zhou Xiangyun was a major real estate magnate in Shanghai, leaving behind a substantial estate. Zhou's first wife passed away long ago, leaving a son and two daughters. The second wife bore one daughter, so the family included a wife, a son, and three daughters. The dispute arose between Wang Fengnian, the husband of the second daughter from the first marriage, and the rest of the family, lasting four years.</p>
<p>Wang Fengnian is a dedicated philanthropist who contributes to education. His ancestor Wang Yinting was also a wealthy merchant. Wang's inheritance was largely used for educational purposes, reportedly exceeding 2.5 billion yuan. In the spring of 1938, he founded Sanwu University in Shanghai. It closed on December 8, 1941, due to the entry of enemy troops into the concession, but his commitment to education remained unwavering.</p>
<p>Estate Dispute Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>In 1943, Zhou Xiangyun fell ill and passed away without a will. Before his death, he entrusted lawyer Gao Junxiang to draft a "Property Gift Deed," gathering Zhou's relatives and friends to sign it. About 80% of the property was to be given to Zhou's wife, son, and daughters-in-law. As Zhou Xiangyun was on his deathbed, his wife held his hand to sign the character "Zhou," but he could not continue. She then used his seal to replace the signature. Subsequently, she, the son, and daughters-in-law signed, but the three daughters did not. Wang Fengnian, as the son-in-law of the second daughter, objected, arguing that the "Property Gift Deed" should be made when the donor is healthy. At this time, Zhou Xiangyun was unconscious, so he accused lawyer Gao of "forgery" and obtained Gao's handwritten draft to bring legal action. However, it was resolved through mediation by lawyer Shan Yuhua. Zhou Xiangyun passed away that afternoon, and the distribution of the estate remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Xiangyun University Cannot Open</p>
<p>Afterwards, Wang Fengnian wrote a letter to Zhou's family, proposing that one-third of the estate be used to establish Xiangyun University. This letter was published in several major newspapers in the city, garnering public sympathy, but Zhou's family ignored it. At that time, under enemy rule, Wang could not act hastily.</p>
<p>After the victory, Wang proposed an early discussion, and the estate's heirs asked Wang Boyuan, the general manager of Kenye Bank, to mediate. The agreement divided the estate into seven shares, with one share, real estate located on Niuzhuang Road and Zhongzheng Middle Road, valued at over 500 gold bars, to be used for public welfare, namely the establishment of Xiangyun University. However, the land deeds remain in the hands of Zhou's family, and Xiangyun University, for which preparations have been underway for four years, cannot be built or opened.</p>
<p>Final Scene Awaits Development</p>
<p>Last month, Wang first sent a letter urging delivery and then announced in the newspaper, in the name of the Xiangyun University Preparatory Office, the reservation of the right to dispose of the two properties. Zhou's family also hired lawyers such as Gao Junxiang to respond, saying that although the property has been designated for public welfare, the specific use should be discussed after it is sold.</p>
<p>Former colleagues of Sanwu University, Xu Chongqin and Shan Yuhua, also jointly wrote to Zhou's descendants at the end of last month, stating: "...If you commemorate your ancestor and support this righteous cause, you will benefit the people and students immensely. If you unfortunately listen to slander and violate the previous agreement, we will submit proposals to the council and resort to law. One call to action will gather supporters, and we will support Wang until the goal is achieved."</p>
<p>Will Zhou's family hand over this share of the estate, and will Xiangyun University be established? We will await further developments!</p>
<h3>Registration of Various Vessels</h3>
<p>(B) The management methods for rowing boats in the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek are determined as follows: The Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Department will jointly announce that all vessels under the jurisdiction of this city must apply for registration at the various vessel registration offices of the Public Utilities Bureau within two months from the date when the license plates for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] are ready. Vessels that fail to register within the deadline will be dealt with according to the rules for dealing with illegal vessels. However, vessels arriving from other ports must apply for registration upon arrival. A comprehensive inspection of all vessels in the port will begin on April 1, 1948, organized by the Public Utilities Bureau with the assistance of officers from the Water Police Sub-Bureau.</p>
<h3>40% Discount for Military and Police Personnel on Ships</h3>
<p>(C) The preferential treatment measures for military personnel traveling by ship are passed as follows: Military and police personnel traveling by ship should present an official letter or travel pass from their military or police organization or unit, which will be certified by the (Shanghai City) Military and Police Personnel Ticket Purchasing Certification Office, jointly organized by the Port Command, Songhu Garrison Command, the Independent 3rd Battalion of the Military Police, the City Police Department, and the Shipping Business Association. They can then purchase tickets from various shipping companies at a 40% discount. The luggage and small items carried by military and police personnel that exceed the regulations for passenger luggage are still subject to freight charges.</p>

<h3>Puji Railway: Inaugural Through Train</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jinan, December 12] The Jinpu Railway Bureau, in order to celebrate the first repaired and reopened section of the Puji Railway since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, which is a vital artery connecting the north and south, invited over a hundred representatives from all walks of life and domestic and foreign journalists from Beijing and Shanghai to take the inaugural train from Pu to Jinan on the 10th for sightseeing. At the same time, another special train was prepared to invite representatives from all walks of life in Jinan to conduct an actual on-site inspection of the rail connection point on the line at the foot of Hongshi Mountain, 300 meters from the 384-kilometer mark between Tai'an and Zhangxia on the 11th, and to observe the road's restoration project.</p>
<p>That morning, I braved the cold winds of the north and stepped into the newly decorated No. 1314 special train, adorned with red and green decorations. The car was heated, making the temperature as warm as spring. The soft sofas were comfortable and pleasant, and the loudspeaker played melodious music, temporarily making me forget that the world outside was still freezing.</p>
<p>The train departed on time at 8:30 AM. Because it was the first trip, the driver was particularly cautious and careful. Slowly, it passed over Baimashan and Dawangzhuang. What appeared before me were the fortress-lined roadsides, densely packed sentry posts, sparsely populated but mostly dilapidated villages, and the villagers holding the most primitive weapons on the square: red-tasseled spears.</p>
<p>There was also a peasant on guard duty on the side of the road, also holding a red-tasseled spear. As the train passed, they struck a pose of attention in a pretentious manner.</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM, the train passed Gangshan to the rail connection point at the foot of Hongshi Mountain. The railway bureau had specially made two wooden signs here, which read "Rail Connection Point" and the date. The train stopped here, and everyone got out of the car and took a group photo at the connection point. I also took a special photo with Director Song Huancheng of the Railway's Engineering Department, Squad Leader An Wenlan of the Repair Squad, and Section Chief Song Jianfang, who contributed the most to the road's repair. After I praised their achievements in an article last time (November 18th, Our Newspaper), the guests and colleagues on the train this time all unanimously praised them as "Repair Heroes."</p>
<p>The communists have what they call "Explosion Heroes," but I firmly believe that our "Repair Heroes" will surely be able to overcome the communists' "Explosion Heroes," and that the power of construction will ultimately be able to prevail over the power of destruction.</p>
<p>Last year, the Jiaoji Railway was also repaired by An's squad. This year, the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway was also completed under their weathering the elements. When Squad Leader An reported in the car that more than 70 people from the repair squad had fallen into the water and drowned while repairing the Da Wen River Bridge, and that he had mobilized his staff to work day and night when Director Chen Shungeng ordered that he had to take a train from Jinan to Pu on the 30th for the first inspection along the way, many people worked hard, lost sleep and rest, and more than 20 people carried a steel rail together, running to the construction site, just like charging into battle on the battlefield. Finally, the rails were successfully connected at Hongshi Mountain at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Everyone couldn't help but feel emotional, and applause broke out enthusiastically!</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, the train headed south, and arrived at Wande at 12:40 PM. In order to return to Jinan that evening, the train turned around at this point. At this time, I saw many old people who were transporting steel rails. During the chat, I learned that these steel rails used to be buried far away in the mud more than two or three miles away under the orders of the communists. This time, they were dug up and transported back after a heavy reward from the railway bureau. The price of this rail was 240,000 yuan (the price is set according to the distance of the road). A friend from the railway bureau told me: Before the war, anyone who stole or destroyed traffic was killed without exception. Now, under the communists' road-destruction policy, the government has to trade it back at a high price, and the military back-and-forth has turned into a people's "burying steel rails" and "selling steel rails," openly doing business with it!</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the train departed from Wande and returned to Jinan, arriving safely at 5:00 PM. After arriving at the station, news came that the communist bandits once ambushed four trains and 8,000 civilians east of Wande today, preparing to destroy the road. After the national army strengthened its forces in the area, they disintegrated and fled separately. Therefore, the knot hidden in everyone's heart is exactly what Commander Wang Yaowu said: "Repairing the road is important, but protecting the road is even more important."

<h3>Jade Emperor Temple in Jiangyin Destroyed by Fire</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, December 16] Guanshan Township in the west of the county has Qinwang Mountain (commonly known as Xiaomaoshan), with the Three Mao Peaks on it. Every spring, the incense is very prosperous. There is a three-story Jade Emperor Temple on the mountain. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was once burned down by the enemy. After the victory, local people raised funds to rebuild it. On the afternoon of the 13th, three young villagers suddenly appeared with a foreign bottle in their hands and went up to the Jade Emperor Temple, only saying that they were playing. The monks in the temple did not suspect anything. The next morning (14th) at about 3:00 AM, the Jade Emperor Temple suddenly burst into flames. At that time, the wind was very strong, and in an instant, the second and third halls were set ablaze. Villagers from Qiaowan, Cha Qi, and other villages near the foot of the mountain went to rescue the fire, but because the mountain was high and the water was dry, they could not extinguish it. The rebuilt Jade Emperor Temple was once again reduced to ashes. Afterwards, the monks realized that it was caused by arson by bandits.</p>

<h3>Students of Zhapu Maritime School Search for Amusement at Night, Merchants and Residents Insulted, Emergency Meeting of All Sectors in the Town</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pinghu, 15th] Since the National Advanced Maritime School moved to Zhapu this autumn and started recruiting students, the issue of school facilities has not yet been resolved as scheduled, so the official start of school is still pending. On the night of the 13th, around 7:00 PM, forty to fifty students from the school caused a major disturbance while buying stationery, which led to widespread anger in Zhapu.

It is reported that around 7:00 PM on the night of the 13th, forty to fifty students from the school were wandering the streets in the dark and then went to the Datel Paper Shop outside the South Gate to buy stationery. Because they questioned the high prices, an argument broke out between the students and the shop assistants. The students then grabbed and beat the shop assistant, Ren Zichen. Shortly after, they went to the Oriental Printing House at the south end of the street and subjected the shop owner, Xu Xiqi, to insults and beatings.

<h3>American Ambassador Summoned Capital Reporters Yesterday to Discuss Sino-American Education Issues, Elaborated on Key Points of Using Education Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] American Ambassador Stuart summoned reporters at 11:00 AM on the 17th to report on the implementation of the Fulbright Act in China and the situation of the first meeting of the Sino-American Education Fund. Ambassador Stuart pointed out that the purpose of Fulbright, who provided this act, and the American government, which implemented it, is to develop international understanding through cultural exchange between the United States and other relevant countries. The United States is taking all steps to implement this act, prioritizing China. Ambassador Stuart explained the principles for using the Sino-American Education Fund and elaborated on two key points: 1. Funding American scholars to come to China to pursue studies must be satisfactory to the Chinese requesting institutions and should be as close as possible to Chinese students, allowing Chinese and American students to share social lives and promote friendship between the two countries. 2. For Chinese students, the Foundation believes that those who have achieved excellent results in American-funded educational institutions should be assisted. Due to currency controls and the fact that the funds are all in Chinese legal tender, the Foundation is unable to send Chinese students or professors to the United States at this time. To the extent possible, the Foundation will encourage direct exchange of students and professors between Chinese and American universities. Finally, Ambassador Stuart announced that until the State Department appoints a formal officer, Embassy Second Secretary Mooreby will serve as the interim executive director of the Foundation.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Education Fund Receives Congratulatory Telegram from Washington</h3>
<p>[American News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Subsequently, the United States established Education Fund Committees in twenty-three countries in order to exchange students and professors with various countries.

According to a telegram received by the American Ambassador from Washington, the U.S. President's Foreign Scholarship Committee held a meeting on December 13th and expressed satisfaction with this. Fulbright, the initiator of the Fulbright Act, which authorizes the implementation of the above plan, attended the meeting. It was stated that cultural exchange between Chinese and American universities has a long history, and therefore China should take the lead in implementing this post-war plan. Mr. Fulbright also explained how Congress authorized the President to establish a Committee of Educators in the United States to supervise the work, so that this plan can maintain its high standards and avoid all political factors. Mr. Fulbright also stated that although the funds for the above plan are in foreign currency, Congress is currently working to provide American dollars to foreign students and professors studying in the United States. The President's Committee approved the previous two resolutions: 1. All educational exchanges must be mutually accepted by both countries. 2. All American educators sent abroad must be requested by the relevant educational institutions. The President's Committee extended its congratulations to the American members and Chinese advisors of the Sino-American Fund.</p>

In the first half, Liao Dihang's long shots repeatedly hit the mark, scoring many points, causing Hualian to fall into a difficult battle. The score was 16-13 and 21-20, with Ziqi leading twice. Hualian changed its strategy and saw success. The team played better in the second half, leading by as much as 22 points, 62-40, at one point, and Ziqi's entire line collapsed.

Hualian Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Liu Fushan scored the first record, each with five equal points. The battle was a tug-of-war, with four ties at 7, 9, 15, and 13.

<h3>Gold Management Bureau Bans Money Exchange Businesses; All Must Close Immediately; Original Names and Signs of Silver Houses and Money Shops Must Be Removed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Money exchange businesses in the city have mostly engaged in foreign currency exchange business. Since the government banned the buying and selling of gold and the circulation of foreign currency, the money exchange businesses have long lost their business targets. It has also been found that the industry mostly uses the names of silver houses and money shops, which is very confusing with the names of silver and money firms and shops approved by the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, in order to correct the public's perception and prevent malpractices, has specially limited the industry to stop all money exchange business from today. In addition, all original names of silver houses and money shops and their signs should be removed. The industry association should also cancel its registration to conform to the facts and eliminate abuses. If there is any delay in complying or any violation, the bureau will send the case to the court for strict handling according to law. It is heard that the above measures will be announced by the bureau and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for execution.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Gold Management Bureau to inquire about his opinion on the ban on money exchange businesses. According to him, money exchange businesses in the city began to be established during the concession period and mostly engaged in foreign currency exchange business. The establishment of the industry has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance, so people generally call them "underground banks." Since the government banned the buying and selling of gold and the circulation of foreign currency, the industry has long lost its business targets and there is no possibility of existence. In addition, it has recently been found that many of those who secretly buy and sell gold and banknotes are still members of the industry, which is a violation of government laws. The bureau consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government and decided to notify Wang Zhengcheng, the chairman of the industry association, that from today, all businesses should be closed and the original signs should be removed to operate other legal businesses to stabilize the social financial order. The person in charge also said that there are a total of 195 money exchange businesses in the city, all of which will be closed from today.</p>

<h3>Resuming Sino-Japanese Trade: Technical Issues Need to Be Resolved; Taiwan Sugar Can Become a Major Export to Japan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] There are still some technical issues that need to be resolved before the actual resumption of business between China and Japan. In addition to the exchange settlement procedures, there is also the issue of credit. In the past, when the China Trust Bureau handled barter trade, it owed millions of US dollars due to the small amount of exports from China, so the Allied Headquarters required that the accounts of future Sino-Japanese trade be guaranteed by the Chinese delegation to Japan. The delegation could not accept it due to its status, and everything is currently under negotiation.</p>
<p>A related person told the reporter: Some technical issues are currently being studied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for decision within days. Regarding the export of Taiwan sugar to Japan, it has not yet been finalized, but China does have a batch of sugar ready to be shipped east, and is currently negotiating prices with the other party. In the world, besides China, there is also Brazil that can supply sugar to Japan. In terms of price, Brazilian sugar prices are lower, and China is actually at a disadvantage, but Taiwan sugar has a stronger sweetness and is favored by the Japanese, which is not easy to change. Therefore, if production increases in the future, it will become a major export to Japan.</p>

<h3>"The Soviet Education System"</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Authored by Medinsky, translated by Zhang Jiming, First edition by Kaiming, April 1947</p>
<p>In the educational thought of the modern world, the Soviet Union and the United States represent two important trends, influencing the advancement of education in other countries. Especially the Soviet Union, in conjunction with its unique political and economic progress, has achieved remarkable success in both the quality and quantity of its cultural and educational endeavors. Our country is about to enter a new stage of democratic constitutionalism. We should look to others as examples in developing national education and promoting a culture of academic research. Although our political system differs greatly from that of the Soviet Union, we can still learn from their unwavering spirit in educational work and the strong conviction they hold for cultural and educational undertakings, which can serve as an encouragement to us.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce to readers "The Soviet Education System" written by Soviet education doctorate, Eugene Nikolayevich Medynsky. Medinsky is a professor at the National Lenin Pedagogical Institute. He has demonstrated extremely outstanding achievements in educational research and has authored many works. From the Soviet education system, we can see how their cultural and educational endeavors strive for quantitative expansion and qualitative improvement under a planned system and supervision. In a certain sense, the education system is a reflection of educational thought. By examining the Soviet education system, we can easily grasp the main trends in their educational thought. This is because the system is not built out of thin air; it is based on the objective needs of society and far-reaching ideals.</p>
<p>This book is almost entirely a report on the current state of education, with little theoretical exploration. The language is concise and clear, and the statistical figures provide us with many recent data. The book is divided into thirteen chapters, covering everything from the goals and organization of education, the school system, facilities at all levels of schools, teacher training, adult education institutions, to educational research, forming a complete system.</p>
<p>The implementation of education in the Soviet Union takes into account the premise of enriching modern knowledge and culture as much as possible, and it also requires the development of independent thinking and creative working abilities. They believe that in order to enable everyone to consciously participate in political life, compulsory education must be implemented to eliminate illiteracy. At the same time, they are mindful of Tsarist Russia before the revolution, when a gulf separated intellectual and physical labor. Now, they have broken it down. In addition to fully developing intelligence and cultivating a progressive worldview, the Soviet education system also includes moral training. Of course, their moral foundation is based on socialist labor ethics. Therefore, the training in their schools and social education institutions focuses on correct labor practice and discipline, and a love and dedication to work. It starts with the teaching of practical skills, expands to an interest in technology and large-scale industrial and agricultural production, and then progresses to learning scientific production skills.</p>
<p>People generally believe that Soviet education is entirely dominated by utilitarian thinking and that the entire education system seems to be only for production, but this is not entirely true. On the other hand of enriching material life, Soviet educators also emphasize cultural cultivation. The construction and equipment of their schools pay attention to aesthetic conditions, and the promotion of art education is spared no effort. In recent years, the Soviet Union has devoted all its efforts to increasing the number of theaters, cinemas, conservatories, and art galleries, which shows their attention to cultural life and they promote and improve these places as much as possible, in coordination with the meaning of education. In order to develop children's aesthetic abilities, extracurricular and intramural activities especially emphasize the concept of educating and living artistically.</p>
<p>The emphasis on physical training is another feature of Soviet education. Physical training occupies an important position in both curricular and extracurricular activities. They regard the physical strength of the people as one of the important "assets" of national strength. All measures related to the health of women and children, as well as various childcare institutions for children under school age, have begun basic physical training. This also contains the meaning of labor and national defense preparation.</p>
<p>From the Soviet education system, we can also see these characteristics: all educational institutions are connected, from kindergarten to the highest level of schools, including adult education, all are consistent and connected; the national education system is jointly implemented by the Soviet state, people's organizations, and families; education is separated from the church and is not bound by religion; at all levels of schools and all educational institutions, men and women enjoy equal educational opportunities; the uniformity of schools, without any ethnic or class differences or restrictions, the curriculum is continuous from the lowest to the highest level; schools at all levels are open to all people, and elementary education is universal and compulsory; developing a culture with a national form and socialist content, and using the students' native language for teaching.</p>
<p>The book provides a clear description of Soviet teachers. In addition to their teaching work, their teachers also actively assume public affairs and national defense work. A strong sense of collectivism makes them brave in sharing various tasks for the country. In the recent German-Soviet War, it fully proved that Soviet teachers are loyal and brave sons and daughters of their motherland and people. They are indeed worthy of the title of "cultural fighters." The heroic and tragic deeds of several brave principals and teachers described in the book truly move us. Soviet teachers not only have rich scientific knowledge and teaching enthusiasm but also have a broad and correct outlook on life and the world. The country does its best to improve the material and spiritual treatment of teachers. There are special institutions to handle teacher welfare. Teachers are not only guaranteed their status, but they can also enjoy various national honors and rewards, such as titles and medals.</p>
<p>The development of adult education in the Soviet Union shows that their various facilities for social education have achieved significant results. The efforts to popularize adult education are almost as great as those to popularize elementary education. Adult secondary schools are established to meet special needs. Libraries and clubs with educational significance have achieved remarkable results in terms of quantity and content. The newly emerging "cultural rest parks" and museums and art galleries have made great contributions to adult education.</p>
<p>As for educational research work, the Soviet Union has now applied various scientific research methods to explore various issues in theory and teaching implementation. In addition to the National Lenin Scientific Education Research Institute, there are also the Public Education Planning and Organization Research Institute, the Technological Education Research Institute, the Central National Education Research Institute, the Children's Literature Research Institute, and the Curriculum and Teaching Methods Research Institute. Soviet educators have applied kindergartens to study the developmental characteristics of early childhood. The establishment of all education systems is based on the research results of experts. Soviet education scholars have written many works on the in-depth study of the history of education. A new style of educational literature has created a new style of educational writing. The Soviet Academy of Educational Sciences, established less than five years ago (the author of this book is also one of the staff members of the Academy), has created many brilliant results in principles, philosophy, psychology, and teaching methods. Today, I don’t know how many famous professors are immersed in research work.</p>
<p>Looking at the development of education in the Soviet Union, it is closely related to their political, economic, and social conditions. Inevitably, it is stained with narrow "nationalism," but their education has developed to specialization, scientification and lifelikeness. Because of specialization, they can focus on research work. Because of scientification, they can pay attention to equipment and the application of new tools and excellent teaching methods. Because of lifelikeness, education and the lives of the broad masses of people are linked. At least the Soviet education facilities are proceeding along a goal and a plan. From the system, it can be seen that their education has a unique "personality". Looking at others, we should think about ourselves, know what to take and what to be wary of, and at the same time, it is a very valuable inspiration and encouragement.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Electric Motors</h3>
<p>— Mang</p>
<p>Authored by Huang Youxiong, published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>"Electric Motors" is divided into three parts: the first part is divided into nine chapters, the second part is divided into five chapters, and the third part is divided into seven chapters. The first part describes the principles and structure of electric motors, as well as the production of the simplest electric motor, from the simplest to the manufacture of various advanced electric motors. The last chapter of this part gives us a correct concept. We used to think that for an electric motor of the same size, if we use different voltages to make it rotate, then the force provided by the high voltage must be greater, and the force provided by the low voltage is naturally smaller. In fact, it is not as we imagined. For an electric motor of the same size, no matter how high or low the voltage supplied, the force it produces is the same. However, before reading this book, I did not know the real situation. Isn't this correcting our previous misconceptions?</p>
<p>The second part describes the principles of transformers and the production of various sizes of transformers. Because it is too uneconomical to use dry batteries or storage batteries to drive electric motors, we can only rely on the current from the electric light wires. However, the voltage of the electric light wires is very high and cannot be directly used. We must use a transformer to reduce the voltage before it can be used. Therefore, a transformer is an essential item in application. The third part talks about the application of electric motors. Here, it tells you the principle of trams, how to apply electric motors to vehicles, electric fans, etc. More interesting is the use of electric motors to make puppets dance. When you actually make and apply these interesting applications, you will be surprised and say: "How great is the power of electric motors!"</p>
<p>The advantage of this book is that the reasoning is simple and clear, making it easy for people to understand. Even people who do not understand electricity at all can gain a considerable understanding after reading this book. Moreover, in the production of electric motors, there are many very simple problems, but after the explanation of the text, they become complicated. The author explains it very thoroughly in this book. The fluent writing style makes people feel not profound. After reading this book, we at least have a general concept of "electricity". This is something we should thank the author for giving us.</p>
<p>Our country has great water power, which can supply us with electricity generation, but we have not been able to make full use of it. This is very regrettable, and it is also because we have not paid close attention to and have a deep and sure understanding of electricity. We always think that electricity is a mysterious thing. In fact, electricity is our close friend, an indispensable thing in daily life. We can use electric power as the motive power of machinery to actively develop our country's industrial and mining industries, but how can we do it without electrical knowledge? First of all, we must know how to apply electric motors. Then, after reading this book, you can start to apply electric motors. Therefore, I believe that anyone who has the ambition to use electric motors but does not have the ability to use electric motors should buy this book and read it. Not only should you read it, but you should also do it yourself. Furthermore, you should use the electric motor creatively.</p>
<h3>Some Opinions on Revising the Publication Law</h3>
<p>— Leng Yan</p>
<p>The current Publication Law was promulgated on July 8, 1937. At that time, it was the day after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. People across the country were wholeheartedly committed to the war of resistance, and did not pay attention to the shortcomings of the Publication Law. After Japan surrendered, and because the country was fragmented and everything was waiting to be rebuilt, the people of the country did not put forward any suggestions for revision. Therefore, the Publication Law has been promulgated for ten years, and the people of the country have never criticized it for its deficiencies. Recently, the period of political tutelage is coming to an end, and constitutional government is just around the corner. The authorities also published some key points for revision in the newspapers on October 31 and November 1. However, the formally revised Publication Law has not yet been announced. Therefore, I would like to write out my humble opinion for everyone to discuss.</p>
<p>A small number of unscrupulous publishers only care about their own interests and do not care about wasting paper, causing readers to suffer losses and infringing on the rights of others. For example, a certain bookstore (of course, referring to a small bookstore) published a book by a certain famous author. In order to sell a few more copies, the content remains exactly the same, and the cover and title may be changed. At the same time, they will be displayed in one place for sale. Readers first buy a certain book, and then see that the title of this book is similar, so they do not examine it carefully and buy it for reference. As a result, they buy something with a different name but the same content, and suffer a financial loss. It seems that the Publication Law should have explicit provisions to ban this kind of trickery by merchants.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is something that the people of democratic countries should enjoy. However, freedom must also have a limit. The key points for revision have already stated that it is not intended to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China. As long as it meets this standard, it should not be interfered with. However, in recent years, because newspapers have criticized the government and officials for their wrongdoings, reporters have often been beaten, newspaper offices have been destroyed, publications have been torn up, and publications have been banned. This has been seen in the newspapers countless times. Criticism is to hope to get on the right track, not to subvert the government or harm the interests of the country. It seems that the Publication Law should explain this in detail, so that it can be said to protect freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Pornographic publications lead people to indulgence, which not only does not help culture, but also harms people's thoughts and morals. Can this be considered "harming the interests of the Republic of China"? Only paying attention to the "harm" of talking about politics and not paying attention to the "harm" of talking about pornography is inevitably knowing one thing but not knowing the other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Publication Law and the Copyright Law are related, and it seems that they should be revised in detail at the same time.</p>
<h3>Secondary English Grammar</h3>
<p>— Wang Yuzhou</p>
<p>Authored by Lu Shuxiang, published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>This book has a total of sixteen chapters, two hundred and ninety-four pages, divided into two volumes. The first volume describes the structure of sentences, and the second volume describes eight types of words. It is extremely suitable for use as a textbook for the first and second grades of senior high school. Below are a few points for introduction.</p>
<p>1.  This book is based on Otto Jespersen's Essentials of English Grammar and Palmer's Grammar of Spoken English, combined with the author's more than ten years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>2.  The text used for explanation strives to be comprehensive in its simplicity, and the sentences used for examples and exercises are relevant to daily life; therefore, reading this book is not only free of any bitter and dull feeling, but also extremely easy to increase the interest in further study.</p>
<p>3.  The structure and usage of sentences occupy half of the book. The book describes in more detail the places that other books omit, and the forms (words, phrases, clauses) of Subject, Object, Complement, etc., and their various positions in the sentence are indicated more clearly.</p>
<p>4.  The example sentences are rich and practical, making it easy for readers to imitate. There are many examples in the application of the three types of Clauses.</p>
<p>5.  Both spoken and written language are taken into account. For example, in spoken language, we say Who did you see? In written language, we say Whom did you see? are all specially explained.</p>
<p>6.  Pronunciation is taken into account. For example, the pronunciation of S and ed at the end of words is not mentioned in ordinary grammar books. This book mentions that in the places where nouns and verbs change in form, they are marked separately after the words, for example: cu"(s); ideas(z); allows(z); asked.(t); expected(id).</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, there are many other features, which can only be understood when reading. I cannot list them one by one. The author was a middle school teacher and has rich teaching experience. He knows the shortcomings and needs of general students. Although he has been teaching at the university in recent years and is famous for his research on Chinese grammar, he still excels in writing this book. From my 30 years of teaching experience, this is a new and most applicable English grammar book, which will be of great help to middle school English teachers.</p>
<p>For such a good book, we cannot help but have the meaning of demanding perfection. I think that the use of punctuation marks, although belonging to the scope of composition, can also be discussed in grammar as an appendix (Lin's Kaiming English Grammar includes this item). Secondly, although the explanation and examples in this book are simpler than other books, there are still a few words that are unfamiliar to middle school students. It seems that they can be extracted, added with Chinese annotations, and attached to the end of the book to make it more convenient for self-study students. I hope that the author will consider our two suggestions when reprinting.</p>
<h3>Gide's "The School for Wives"</h3>
<p>— Lu Xian</p>
<p>The Swedish Academy decided to award this year's Nobel Prize for Literature to André Gide, a great contemporary French writer, and declared: "His works are profound in subject matter and perfect in art. The life problems and situations described in his works show his courage to admire the truth and his skill in analyzing psychology."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bian Zhilin, "The School for Wives" has at least three translations in China: Wang Yilei's "A Young Girl's Dream"; Chen Zhanyuan's "School for Wives"; and Jin Mancheng's "The School for Women". According to Mr. Bian Zhilin's translation, it should be "Female Learning".</p>
<p>This is really a wonderful thing. From the different translations, one can imagine the different styles of each translator.</p>
<p>If "The School for Wives", "Robert", and "Geneviève" are a triptych (Gide said this in the author's preface to "Geneviève"), then "Female Learning" should be the first painting in the triptych.</p>
<p>Obviously, Gide has a strong desire to reveal the secrets of women through the mouths of women themselves. This secret contains a wide range of things: psychology, thoughts, outlook on life, style, character... all within his scope of portrayal. This plan is huge, but we don't have to worry about Gide. His style is always so delicate, refined, and incomparably beautiful, so although his attempt is large and inappropriate, he himself will not get lost. Grasping a small point, he supports the framework of the whole book. In terms of momentum, Gide's book cannot be compared with Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe"; in terms of technique, Gide's exquisite skills cannot be matched by others. Especially when women are the object of portrayal, Gide is even more prominent. Turgenev is also good at portraying women, but he cannot help but become superficial. Zola tends to be exaggerated, Tolstoy is too profound, Romain Rolland is too passionate, and only A. Gide deserves to be delicate and refined. He tells the story in a roundabout way, and finally comes to his fatalism: "Women are women". Gide's most wonderful technique is to use small artistic conceptions to express his philosophy. The essays in "The Return of the Prodigal Son" are the best explanation.</p>
<p>I like the book "Female Learning". The whole book is full of beautiful style, from infatuation to thorough understanding, from great happiness to great despair, from the mood of a girl's heart to the deep emotions of a woman... there are extremely beautiful descriptions. Because it is written in the form of a diary, the style is closer to a prose poem than a novel. A. Maurois has also written several small books on the theme of exploring the inner meaning of women's hearts, but compared with Gide, the former's descriptions are inevitably superficial.</p>
<p>Evelyne, a pure woman, like the protagonists in Gide's other novels, is also a beautiful, deep, and stubborn woman. When she was still a girl, she met a handsome young man, Robert, during a wandering. They fell in love and got engaged. Part 1 of "Female Learning" is Evelyne's fragmentary thoughts written before her engagement. She is madly in love with her lover, obviously a little blindly, so the diary is full of the sincere words of a girl, although she says with great understanding: "Seeing that the reason why women live in this world is nothing more than to make their talents. Character. Even more valuable, and all the values are nothing more than appendages to a certain "Mr."'s degree of joy, which really makes me unhappy." But she feels the same way about her lover, Robert.</p>
<p>However, Evelyne's character of being wholeheartedly devoted made her blind for a while. After a long time, the passion faded slightly, and she was originally a person who was almost stubbornly true, so in the end she finally discovered the baseness of Robert's hypocrisy hiding the filth. - Yes, this was twenty years later. Twenty years can bring about great changes in a woman, which is difficult to estimate. According to common sense, even if Evelyne's character has not been assimilated by Robert, it should have been "eroded by time"? But Gide never allows his female characters to be content with fate. Twenty years later, Evelyne not only does not appreciate Robert's hypocrisy, but cannot bear it anymore, like a volcano that has been silent for a long time, she stabs Robert with her passion, stabs her relatives, and also stabs himself.</p>
<p>Evelyne is not comfortable with her environment, not comfortable with her fate, and especially not comfortable with having such a husband. Why is that? Just because a mature woman, a woman who has her own opinions in all aspects, sees the "self-sacrifice" drama of Robert and his ilk, even if it is performed more tragically, it is just a common farce in the world. She tried several times to escape the cage, several times to leave the control of the husband she had so blindly loved, but she could not. The sympathy of the entire society was obviously not on her side, but on the side of the hypocritical and dignified Robert.</p>
<p>Evelyne mentioned her daughter several times in her diary, saying how Geneviève calmly observed the conflict between her parents. Here, she foreshadowed the book "Geneviève".</p>
<p>Gide is good at writing explanatory literary works. Mr. Bian Zhilin commented on his "Return of the Prodigal Son" and said:</p>
<p>"...Regardless of the colorful appearance, the focus of these words is on thoughts or concepts. The most perfect way to express the mystery is to entrust it to symbols, so that the words and metaphors become crystals." In fact, "Female Learning" is also such a symbolic novel, and there is no more appropriate comment than Mr. Bian Zhilin's approval.</p>
<p>If someone compiles a series of books on women's issues, I think Gide's few pamphlets can be included in the series. In China, there are many translators of Gide's works. The most faithful should be Sheng Chenghua, and the one with its own elegant taste should be Bian Zhilin. Li Liewen has also translated some of Gide's works, which are collected in his "Encounter Grass", such as "On Classical Literature", etc., which still retain Gide's unique rhythm. This time, the "Female Learning" that I read was Jin Mancheng's translation, and the writing style is a bit delicious, which may be related to the degree of understanding.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On the Appreciation of Refined and Popular Art Together</h3>
<p>— Wang Qi</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Ma Yuqing acquired the Ming dynasty editions of Feng Menglong's "Words from the Window" and "Leaning on a Pillow" collections, as well as the first edition of "The Tale of Subduing Demons." He named his study the "Subduing Demons Hall" and also called it the "Non-Eligible for Elegant Appreciation Library," because Mr. Ma was famous domestically for his collection of Yuan and Ming dynasty novels, and unofficial histories have always been discriminated against as being unfit for refined appreciation.</p>
<p>However, these novels are actually suitable for refined appreciation. They are bound with magnetic cyan paper covers, snow-white Lian Shi inner pages, and white silk thread, and come in brocade or blue cloth cases. They should be placed in the rare book room of the National Peiping Library or in some study hall. Compared to their previous circulation and recitation among cart pullers and peddlers, they are simply incomparable. The so-called "unfit for refined appreciation" is nothing but a satirical comment.</p>
<p>Ancient novels have been refined by scholars, and the unrefined common people immediately create new ones. This has been the case from ancient times to the present. In any case, refined people do not innovate; they only steal things from the common people. First, they appreciate them, and then they complain that they are too vulgar and base. So, they refine them until the common people no longer want them. Isn't this the case with Song lyrics, Yuan dramas, Tang dynasty quatrains, and Six Dynasties ballads? Southern opera originated in Wenzhou, while Kunqu opera became popular in Kunshan. Now, I guarantee that the common people in these places will not understand them; they want to sing Tanhuang or other genres. Shanxi Bangzi arrived in Beijing and became Jing Bangzi, which was then refined into "Qinqiang." The Han tune Zhengdiao was also refined into Pi Huang, while the common people still have their own brand-new, vibrant things. Nowadays, Shaoxing opera has been vulgarly refined by people in the cities, and perhaps one day the people of Shaoxing will not understand the so-called "Yue Opera."</p>
<p>It seems that Shen Defu lamented in "Ye Huo Pian" about the popularity of small tunes such as "Hitting Dates with Poles" and "Hanging Branches," considering it a sign of the decline of social morals. In fact, firstly, he forgot about the ancient Yangzhi lyrics and Liuzhi lyrics; secondly, he proved that "Hanging Branches" had not been thoroughly refined. If it really no longer expresses "the decline of social morals," then it means that it has become a "thing of the court," no longer related to the common people.</p>
<p>However, some people have proposed the phrase "refined and popular art together for appreciation." This statement sounds good, but in reality, it is impossible because refined and popular are always opposed and can never "come together." People who appreciate the vulgar things of "lower-class people" will never appreciate "pure white snow." And "Yang A Xie Lu," which wins the harmony of hundreds of people, seems to be a "middle-class element," but who knows that this kind of person is an awkward thing that is neither vulgar nor refined, "neither one," but not "together"!</p>
<p>So, besides vulgar, there is refined; and outside of refined, all is vulgar. How is Chinese refinement produced? Chinese writers plunder the forms of folk literature and deliberately refine them, and then scold those vulgar people thoroughly.</p>
<p>If they get a little more support, they smugly say: "Refined and popular art together for appreciation!"</p>
<h3>On the Inevitable Inferiority of Literature When People are Poor</h3>
<p>— Xuan Xuan</p>
<p>I recently read the ninetieth anniversary issue of the American "Atlantic" magazine and was quite moved.</p>
<p>First, although the United States is currently considered the strongest of the strong countries, its nation is really young and immature, and its culture is short-lived and has not yet evolved into a fixed form, far from our country's boast of five thousand years of culture. But they already have a magazine with ninety years of history, and although it is not as "old and virtuous" as the British "Punch," it is enough to be called the eldest brother in the world of magazines. We don't have such a magazine. Those that have vitality either die young or suffer all kinds of torture, eventually becoming unable to exist. "Eastern Magazine" is considered the oldest, with decades of publication history, but who still remembers such a magazine?</p>
<p>Second, among the comprehensive magazines in the United States, "Atlantic" and "Harper's" are considered the most advanced. The former focuses slightly more on literature and art, while the latter pays more attention to thought and political commentary. Although these two things may not really be able to achieve perfection in every article, at least seven out of ten articles have a value worth reading. "Popular" magazines like "Saturday Evening Post" and "Collier's" can have two or three million readers in the United States, but high-level magazines like "Atlantic" and "Harper's" also have more than one hundred thousand people who regularly buy them. This shows the cultural level of Americans: most people are庸俗, but therefore magazines like "Atlantic" can also exist. In our country, square weekly magazines can be "best-selling," but truly weighty high-level publications are either extremely rare, or if they exist, they have no readers, and the result is always closing down. This matter concerns the hundred-year plan of national culture, but who pays attention to these things?</p>
<p>"Atlantic" magazine was founded ninety years ago. At that time, it had the nature of a coterie magazine, but it was started by a publisher and a few writers. The people present were all willing to help, and the result was that it was published. This matter is detailed in the article "The Growth of American Magazines" in the ninetieth anniversary issue of "Atlantic." At that time, the writers who participated in writing were all first-class writers representing the culture of New England (the academic area of the United States). They held the ambition of "publishing the best works of the best contemporary writers to the world." Ninety years later, this goal has been achieved. The founders had this courage, and the readers also had the courage to accept it, so "Atlantic" could shine in the world. Looking back at us, there are not many writers with such a pioneering spirit, and there are almost no publishers with such foresight. The readers, moreover, are muddleheaded and cannot support a good publication. Part of it is due to economic strength, and part of it is due to the prevailing atmosphere, lacking the enthusiasm for reading, creating a vacuum in today's publishing industry.</p>
<p>Third, American magazines like "Atlantic," especially this ninetieth anniversary issue, can be said to have beautiful and inexhaustible content. The "comprehensiveness" has also been achieved to a fairly balanced degree. Look at its several major articles: Einstein on atomic war and peace, the unpublished love letters of Mark Twain, Wells on the pressure factions and foreign policy of the United States Department of State, Sedgwick (the current editor of "Atlantic") on editing techniques, Jones on the beliefs of modern people, Shaw on the cultivation of connoisseurs, and Mao Dun on Madame Bovary. Reading these few has a feeling of "the end of modern essays."</p>
<p>Why do people have so many good articles? First, the editors have vision; second, the publishers are willing to spend money; third, the editors are willing to work hard. It is difficult to achieve the first two, and the third cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Editors with vision will then produce new writers. There are so-called "discoverers" in the foreign literary world, which refers to these editors who are good at spotting talent. Editors with vision will then have articles that feature "the person and the event." Western magazines have published "Hitler in the Eyes of a Female Servant," "My Lover Mussolini," Maurois's "Inside Story of the Collapse of the French Army," "How I Dropped the Atomic Bomb," the Duke of Windsor's "Memoirs," etc. Only the person involved can write about these things, all of which are enough to captivate the world. Why don't Chinese magazines invite Gu Weijun to write "Impressions of Diplomatic Figures"? Why don't they invite Song Ziwen to write "The Art of Borrowing Money"? Ahemaitijiang, a powerful figure in the Northwest, has not yet had anyone write about his origins, and "An Unofficial History of Taking Over" has not yet appeared. The lack of a habit of publishing in China is certainly a major reason, but the lack of editorial vision is also a fact.</p>
<p>It is even more difficult to get publishers to spend money than to take their lives. The American "Life" pictorial specially published three memoirs of the Duke of Windsor, who loved beauty more than his country, but the amount of the fee is still a secret between "Life" and Windsor, and outsiders have no way of finding out. This number must be considerable. It is naturally expensive to buy Churchill's "History of the Second World War." Chinese publishers only want to copy, who would be willing to pay such a high price for manuscripts?</p>
<p>The current lack of good articles to read in China does not have to be entirely attributed to one aspect. This is just a problem of poverty. When people are poor, their ambitions are short-sighted. Therefore, publishers only want to "make a quick buck," and people who write articles can only be known for their quantity. Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh at "Atlantic"!</p>
<h3>A Wrong Move</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>The fate of hundreds of millions of people in the world is often controlled by just one inadvertent action of certain people. This kind of wrong move is sometimes really incredible.</p>
<p>If one of the finance ministers of King Louis XIV of France was not named Fouquet, then France might almost occupy most of the current British Empire, and the so-called Germany might become a group of harmless small dynasties. It is certainly not wrong for a person's name to be Fouquet, and that is also powerless, but he unnecessarily played tricks, and that was a wrong step. Originally, in ancient France, the meaning of "Fouquet" was "squirrel," and this Fouquet flaunted this small animal on his weapons and adorned it with the inscription: "The sky is the limit." In reality, he was more interested in the ocean than the sky.</p>
<p>Whether he was far-sighted or short-sighted, he decided to advise the King that France should build a two-ocean navy. He believed that with its huge fleet, France could develop commerce wherever its flag flew, and the profits gained would be much greater than fighting constantly on the eastern border. Louis XIV was moved and came to attend a banquet held by Fouquet in his villa on the Seine River in order to listen to his insightful arguments. However, before he could hear the wonderful arguments, he saw wonderful writing: on the door, on the carpets, on the chairs, on the plates, and on the servants' uniforms, there were squirrels everywhere, adorned with inscriptions, declaring that Mr. Fouquet's "limit was the sky"! This, of course, did not suit the taste of the autocratic emperor, so Louis XIV left in anger. Fouquet was dismissed, and the ideal of building an overseas empire naturally went up in smoke. As a result, the French advanced east to the Rhine, and the exhausting wars between Germany and France followed one after another.</p>
<p>Another "wrong move" occurred in 1757, which was later found to have been a big mistake. A clerk in the British War Office refused a pair of applications to serve in the British army. The book came from George Washington, who was famous throughout the world, and was then a colonel in the Virginia militia. Colonel Washington had indeed saved a British army from danger with his bravery, but this guy was a colonial, and his parents were not British, so letting him serve under the local governor was already very preferential treatment. So he became the head of a local self-defense team, and his rank would never be higher than any officer below the rank of lieutenant in the British army. Naturally, Washington had his own plans, he did not forget to forgive; the price of that wrong move was the entire United States. If those applications had been approved at that time, the subsequent events would have been unpredictable!</p>
<p>A century later, in 1857, Britain lost a large part of its empire's heart again. The native soldiers in the East India Company's army were given a batch of cartridges. These cartridges used oiled caps, and on the old guns, these caps had to be bitten off with the mouth so that the gunpowder could be poured into the gun body and the gun body. Part of the oil applied to the cartridges was made of butter, which was sacred and inviolable to Hindus; and the other part was made of lard, which greatly offended Muslims. It was really too coincidental, insulting the entire people of India at once! What a "wrong move" the result was the immediate outbreak of the Indian rebellion.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flowers</h3>
<p>— Wang Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Two Hearts in Harmony (17)</p>
<p>Qiwan said, "I had a few more drinks today and felt very comfortable as I relieved Chengdou of its administrative duties. Time flies so fast. The last time I came here to watch the boat race was in the summer, and in the blink of an eye it is already late autumn and early winter. How can people not get old!" Zhuzhai smiled and said, "You are in your prime. Why are you sighing about old age!" Qiwan said, "Everyone says I am in my prime, and I also think I am in my prime, but unfortunately, I can't grasp this golden age. With my family environment and my previous work in art, I am afraid I will let this golden age down!" Zhuzhai said, "A person's success comes from struggle. You have already broken through many difficulties, and your future is very promising. Don't be too hesitant." The two talked and talked, and unknowingly had reached the Sound of Flowing Water. Standing on the platform piled with rocks and looking, a round moon had broken through the clouds, and the clear light poured down like silver. Zhuzhai said, "The moonlight is very good tonight. How about we sit here for a while?" As he spoke, he took out a handkerchief, dusted off a stone stool, spread it with a handkerchief, let Qiwan sit down, and sat down next to her. Qiwan looked at the moonlight and said, "The moonlight is too good tonight, but unfortunately the moon is not always round. In a few days, it will wane again!" Zhuzhai said, "The moon has its waxing and waning, which is a fixed cycle. I only believe that people should enjoy life in time and not worry too much!" Qiwan knew that Zhuzhai was comforting her, and she was very touched. She couldn't help but move her body closer to Zhuzhai. She was about to pour out the bitterness in her heart when a cloud suddenly covered the bright moon, and the earth suddenly turned black. Zhuzhai said, "There is a saying in the pear garden world, 'Clouds covering the moon.' Tan Xinpei's voice is bright in the sand, and Mei Lanfang's voice is crisp in the sand. They are all 'clouds covering the moon.' Last night I heard your Yu Tang Chun, and a few sentences were like Mr. Mei's crisp voice, but unfortunately everyone ignored it." Qiwan gently elbowed Zhuzhai and said, "Don't talk nonsense. How can I compare to Mr. Mei!" At this time, the moon had broken through the clouds again, and the earth reappeared with light. Zhuzhai saw Qiwan's beautiful face illuminated by the moonlight and smiled, "Why can't you compare to Mr. Mei? Judging from your age, you are more than thirty years younger than him. Even if he comes on stage again, he will not be as good as before. Don't underestimate yourself too much and be too hesitant." Qiwan said, "My ambitions are very high, and I also want to work hard, but I am limited by my current environment, and it is very difficult to succeed. Now I have learned several ancient costume plays from Mr. Mei, and just adding the costumes is killing me! Now it is not like the era when Mr. Mei sang opera. Whether or not there will be support for singing Mei style opera is a problem. Adding costumes is an even bigger problem."</p>
<h3>Morley's Quotations</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>The trouble with marriage is that there is too little "Wed" and too much "Lock." If people can separate for a while, they can love each other more deeply.</p>
<p>A woman feels quiet when she falls into a love net, and a man talks more when he falls into a love net.</p>
<p>Women exaggerate when they speak in high spirits, because they spend 90% of their lives in "words that can't express everything."</p>
<p>He felt unhappy because his beard was gray. He thought this was his flag of truce, a sign of surrender.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton carved two holes, one for the big cat and one for the small cat. People laughed at him for being stupid, saying that small cats could also use larger holes. May I ask what should be done when two cats want to go through the hole at the same time?</p>
<p>If you turn on the hot water tap first when taking a bath, the bathroom will be full of steam. You should put in the cold water first, and then the hot water you need, so that the bathroom will not be foggy. Perhaps the same is true in our minds. (Excerpted from Christopher Morley's works)</p>
<p>Embroidered Image Chongqing Commentary</p>
<h3>Ode to Big Rats</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuweng, Dragon Life Painting</p>
<p>In Sichuan, especially in Chongqing, rats biting people, even biting off the noses of babies, is just like dogs biting people, and does not contain too much news. Cats are so few and so easy to die that they will get an incurable disease after eating rat meat. Of course, the rats can only run rampant. Just looking at their weight of several pounds, you can know the scale of their food intake, and they cannot survive except by stealing. Regarding this, we should blame God for arranging their instincts, but not caring about their food.</p>
<p>What is even more hateful is that gnawing on things that cannot be eaten is the rats' intentional harming of others without benefiting themselves. For example, eating peanuts from a pocket, they must tear the clothes, which is even more hateful than eating a baby's nose. Objectively, for the rats: babies are slightly close to food, but clothes cannot fill the stomach at all. Although the former is more cruel.</p>
<p>People are also like this</p>
<p>In the voice of suppressing the rebellion, it is actually necessary. Even if a little oil is squeezed, such as "big bucket in, small bucket out," the common people will not say anything. Just as there are no cats, they can only accept their fate. However, they must call farmers to pick them from hundreds of miles away in the countryside. After picking them, they deliberately delay the acceptance for many days, causing people to labor and waste time, and are forced to bear many days of expensive food in the city, which is the common complaint of farmers in Sichuan. The corruption in Sichuan has become a trend, and the common people seem to have become accustomed to the abuse of the people by corruption. They have no choice but to seek the next best thing, "Do less of the abuse of the people that does not contribute to corruption," which has become the farmers' requirement for incense to pray for, like the fate of those who rely on the heavens for food due to disaster and crop failure, and can only blame themselves, and only ask not to eat the crops into a barren land.</p>
<p>Not long ago, after the Chongqing refugee station of the General Relief Administration ended, it was surrounded by boatmen, and the chief auditor who could not get on the car or plane had to escape at night, causing an uproar. According to the evidence published when entertaining reporters, in order to wait for the settlement of accounts, the wooden boats were first detained in Hankou, causing the Chongqing boatmen to wait in Hankou for half a year. By the time the boat price was returned, the boatmen had eaten and pawned everything, and the old wives and daughters brought on the boat had been sold in foreign lands.</p>
<h3>Strange Student</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>On December 12th, students from Chengdu Chenghua University marched, posting slogans all over the streets, saying "Rather die than not be nationalized." As the saying goes, death can be heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather. University students are willing to commit suicide because the school they are studying in is not changed to a national one. Is their death heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather?</p>
<p>To be greedy for life and fear death is human nature. I don't know how many people are starving and freezing all over the world, but there are few suicides. They may be muddleheaded people, only knowing how to prolong their lives, and are not enough to speak of the greatness of death, so let's not discuss them. The "light-hearted" spirit of the dozens and hundreds of students at Chenghua University who said "Rather die than not be nationalized" is truly unprecedented!</p>
<p>I don't understand why the private or national nature of a university is related to the life and death of students. If students are willing to commit suicide if the school is not nationalized, then so many founders, directors, and principals of private universities in the world cannot escape the crime of abetting suicide. There should not be so many private universities in the world, and there should not be so many students and graduates of private universities. Even if it is said that only Chenghua University students will have difficulty surviving if the school is not nationalized, dropping out of school is always better than seeking death. However, those students who marched and posted slogans would rather die than do anything else. Isn't that a strange thing?</p>
<p>China was originally a country that respected the elderly, but now it is a country that respects youth, especially youth and students. Every move of young students is applauded and praised, saying that doing so is to love and protect youth with all their strength. However, youth is youth after all. If you can forgive my disrespect, I want to compare the young students, the future masters of the country, to the children in the family who carry on the family line. The British scholar Russell "once met a lady who argued that children should never be forbidden to do anything; because a child should develop his nature from within, so he should not encounter external obstacles in his development." And Russell asked her: "If his nature leads him to swallow a needle into his stomach, what should he do?" And "Judging from the facts, we cannot but admit that if every child is really allowed to act freely, he will sooner or later swallow a needle into his stomach." (Quoted from Russell's Collection of Skeptical Essays) In China, there are many young mentors who advocate that young students should never be forbidden to do anything. Taking student movements as an example, every time students make a student movement, they all give students unlimited sympathy, no matter what the movement is about. As a result, the slogan of rather dying than not nationalizing the school has also been posted. If Chenghua University really does not change to a national one and the students really go from slogans to practice, wouldn't that be equivalent to a child swallowing a handful of needles into his stomach?</p>

<p>Reader Mailbox</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Ruyuan from Danyang: This matter has no contract and is difficult to handle. Furthermore, the description in your letter is unclear and there is no way to answer it. It seems that you can first study it with a local lawyer.</p>
<p>To Mr. Jiang Wenlong from Nantong: The government has no regulations. There was such news once, but it was not officially announced. This matter is rich in temporality and spatiality, and even if there are precedents, they are not suitable for reference.</p>
