<h3>魏德邁特使離檀島　明由關島逕飛南京　在京部署後擬來滬一行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿日電〕美大使館今日官稱，據魏德邁將軍最近電吿，渠定於廿二日下午四時前後逕自關島飛抵南京。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據此間美軍方面確悉：魏德邁將軍，已定於明（廿二）日自關島乘軍機逕飛南京，不在上海停留。駐滬美軍要員，均已接得命令，於明晨乘專機飛京，歡迎魏特使，並有所會商。美軍方面又稱：魏德邁將軍此次逕飛南京，乃因亟欲謁晤蔣主席，並與政府各要員晤談，在京將谷事部署就緒後，即將抽暇來滬一行。按魏將軍此次來華，己屬第三次，魏氏於　一九四四年繼故史迪威將軍任美軍駐華總司令，功勳京著，至大戰勝利，美軍司令部設上海時，曾返國一行，不久即回滬，至一九四六年夏，方奉召返國。此次又奉令來華，視察我國目前一般情形，獲得政府當局及各方人士一致歡迎，聞魏氏在我國將有一月餘之遇留，以便與政府當局詳細商討各項有關問題。又美西太平洋海軍總司令柯克上將，定今（廿一）日下午三時，乘旗艦自靑抵滬，本市中美各界人士，以柯克將軍久別滬濱，已準備歡迎。據此間美海電當局發言人稱：柯克將軍是否赴京與魏德邁將軍會晤，刻尚未能決定，聞柯氏在滬將逗留六日，定廿七日乘原艦返靑。</p>
<p>〔合衆社檀香山廿日電〕魏德邁將軍廿日稱，渠所率領之研究對華援助代表團，不受任何種類之約束牽制。渠發表此項聲明，顯爲對新聞界解釋渠星期五之談話而發。該項解釋爲「馬歇爾計劃之援助，可能擴大至中國及朝鮮，包括一切受蘇聯支配下之區域在內」。魏德邁之宣傳顧閒華生稱，代表團至少在研究東方情形至六周之久，而其動作因此將決定於其研究之結果。華生稱，魏德邁將軍不能對渠之希望或意圖發表聲明。全部研究將爲一「客觀研究」。魏德邁一行定於廿日乘美陸軍運輸機離此赴華。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿日電〕此間觀察家認為魏德邁來京後，最初至少兩日，除正式　會外，不致與中國官方進行磋商，而將召集顧問及司徒雷登以次大使館職員，專心聽取最近報告，俾便着手調查工作。概項工作或當限於對國府與美大使館供給之報告加以評價。蔣主席是否援引過去款待馬帥成例，邀請特使前赴牯嶺，一部份人士頗滋揣測。據信魏德邁鑒於馬帥經驗之暗示，或將駐京度夏，以免妨礙其中立者實施調查之使命。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕魏德邁將軍來華在即，政府為集思廣益起見，特邀民社黨主席張君勛晉京洽商，張氏已接受邀請，定今日偕徐傳霖·戢翼翹晉京。張氏行前表示：魏將軍抵華後，我國盈將政治·軍事·經濟之實際情形坦率相告，如此則於大局有補。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿日電〕政府準備接待魏德邁將軍聲中，政界及工商界人士又復盛傳行政院不久即將改組，非正式方面謂，政府爲配合執行總動員令起見，行政院人事將有更動，包括顧維鈞博士之內調任外長，王世杰外長之調長敎育部及陳立夫部長之出長社會部。一般華人漸已贊同美方報紙之意見，認爲魏德邁雖係中國之患難朋友，但此次來華，當不致携有大批中國需要之物，其主要配備，當僅爲一空白之記錄簿。據悉，政府各部包括外交部，資源委員會，經濟部等，均將分別向魏氏提出報吿，而外交部及經濟部之報吿，均將涉及對日和約及開放對日貿易之問題。</p>

<h3>杜聿明將軍抵滬　肺疾復發即將赴美療治　據談東北局勢轉趨穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東北保安司令長官杜聿明即將出國療養，於十九日晨離瀋飛平，昨日下午自平飛滬，四時飛抵江灣機塲，同來者有杜氏夫人男女公子六人及東北軍區空軍司令張廷蒙，中蘇日報社長余紀忠等，並自帶醫生一人隨機照料。本市軍政黨團各界均派代表前往機塲歡迎，計到吳市長代表張彼德，宣司令代表沈嘯風，潘議長代表項昌權，市黨部方治，謝仁釗，市參議負奚玉書等二百餘人。杜氏衣藍綢長袍，白襪黑布鞋，面容蒼白，臉上汗珠如豆，由侍從扶携下機後，先與各界代表握手問好，繼由上海小姐劉德明，宋敏芝代表軍之友社獻上鮮花。杜氏因病中體弱，不能在陽光下久立，旋即用舁床抬入汽車，駛至寶建路大華醫院休息，院方當時曾派護士兩名至機塲照料。杜氏此次係因肺部舊疾復發，同時腿部因在關外指揮作戰而受寒致疾，亦迄今未痊，故需出國療養。在滬辦理出國手續，尚有約一星期之躭擱，擬至美國何處目前尚未決定，旅美多久將視病况而定。至夫人與公子等則將留居滬上。</p>
<p>記者旋訪社氏於大華醫院，詢以東北現狀。據談，自四平街大捷後東北局勢已相當穩定，共匪於短期內當無力量發動第四次攻勢。共匪在東北因有後台供給糧餉彈藥，故實力相當雄厚，惟比較起來仍不如國軍，僅爲流竄性質而已。匪軍中有韓共及日俘參加，韓共人數至少在十萬以上，日俘則僅四五千人。東北現狀，以土地而論，共匪約佔二分之一，以人口而論，國軍區域佔五分之三，以資源而論，百分之八十之產區在國軍手中。東北一般民氣士氣均極良好。對於外傳長白山區仍有日軍拒絕投降負嵎頑抗之說，杜氏稱不能證實。渠認爲日本在東北再起爲不可能之事。記者詢以東北一般人對張學良是否懷念，杜稱「差不多已遺忘矣」。杜氏並稱，渠此次出國純係療養，並無其他任務。</p>

<h3>共匪擾綏南</h3>
<p>伊盟已有嚴密部署</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏十九日電〕共匪三萬人，有僅攻平凉一帶企圖，近陷三邊，有一部深入鄂托克旂，現伊盟警備司令陳玉用在郡王旂與伊盟盟長圖王共商伊盟南部軍事，已有嚴密部署。又十七日共匪八百餘人深入綏南淸水河境一百三十餘里，當經駐軍截擊，共匪敗退。是役斃匪六十餘人，獲步槍五十餘枝，機槍數挺。伊盟各旅及東勝等三縣大旱，食糧缺乏，人民己陷饑饉中。</p>

<h3>留京參員集會　交換普選意見</h3>
<p>不　成政黨提名辦法</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕普選即將展開，留京參政員對選舉之技術及時間問題，十九日曾舉行座談會討論，並決定推請張潛華，達浦生等四氏向當局陳述意見。張氏廿日語一記者稱：「本會站在人民立塲，凝向常局提供意見。本會同人認爲此次普選，應充分反映人民意見，充分發揮民主精神，未來民主政治之基礎始克鞏固。聞目前一黨派提名等意見，吾人認爲有運民主精神」。張等定二十一日開始向部力子，陳立夫，吳鐵城等提供意見，藉供參考。</p>
<h3>若干參員主張　普選盈予延期</h3>
<p>待戡亂完成後舉行</p>
<p>另聞參政員有主張在目前局勢下進行普選或有不當，故決向當局提請延期，不必在一面戡亂一面選舉之矛盾情况中進行。待戡亂軍事結束後，再行普選；同時參員認爲循立委爲當然候選之規定，參員亦盈享受同等待遇，亦以參員爲立委當然候選人。</p>
<h3>改組地方政府　原則已無問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨以改組地方政府事宜，詢諸張君勱氏，據答稱：「本人向主修明政治應先改組地方政府，而改組地方政府應先以文人主政，此項原則政府已加接受。各黨派參加地方政府人選尚在洽商中，以民社黨而論，或不援參加實際工作。關於普選之事，在京之接洽，相信兩週或十日內可有結果，此例選舉一點，大致可無問題」。詢以民社黨內部糾紛有無和解可能，張氏表示：如能取消革新委員會，則尚有和解之可能。</p>

<h3>英報評論中國局勢　認蘇聯圖窺新疆　驅使中共造成混亂局面</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿日電〕保守黨　舌極有聲望之「約克郡郵報」發表關於中國局勢之長篇社論，認爲蘇聯有窺伺中國新疆省，中亞全部，以迄於印度邊界以內之野心。該報指出。新疆省近多年來之貿易，多已經由土耳其斯坦鐵路西向發展，而不經由戈壁大沙漠以達北平需時六星期之路程，故料蘇聯最後終將設法奪取新疆。此外，蘇聯並擬以中共爲前驅，以佔領東九省全部。該報促中國消除馬克斯主義派及國民黨反動派，以粉碎蘇聯之計間，並减輕國民之痛苦。該報之言有云：「中國確正處於痛苦之狀態，八年戰爭已破壞整個行政系統，其閣員之個人素質雖較以前之政府爲佳，然經騐豐富可資信任之官吏，仍如鳳毛麟角。共產黨可稱彼等爲「農民唯一友人」之說，已經證明爲不確。中國之共產份子，顯然正盡力造成混亂及痛苦局面，以推　國民政府，而在殘破之狀態中，建立其本身之地位。吾人猶憶在中國歷史上，當一朝垮台以後，其混亂局面，正與今日中國之局勢相同，所不同者，今日之中國必須習於西方之新政治方式，更重要者，在消除馬克斯主義者及反動份子等兩頑固派。此兩派之人，不顧國家利益，使戰爭　續不已，以遂其本身之志願。</p>

<h3>召開對日和會初步會議　蘇表示拒絕參加　美力主早與日本訂和約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十日廣播：據蘇聯駐美大使館透露，蘇聯已拒絕參加美國發起之對日和會。此說美國務院已于以承認。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕美國官員雖遭遇英國及其自治領反對第一次會期之挫折，然仍表示以最大決心，主張平日簽訂日本和約，同時美國由於英·澳·紐西蘭定於八月間召開會議，洽商此一同一問題，下月不能開始行動，表示失望，然美國專家認爲彼等業己對美邀請發生基本上有希望之反響。</p>
<p>另一方面稱：除蘇聯外，其餘有關此事之十個國家，已在原則上同意進行日本和約。美國民意亦極力贊成此一行動。荷蘭業已無條件接受美國之邀請。權威方面稱：法大使己表示其本國政府對此事無甚困難，並信菲列濱，中國及加拿大大部份皆表示贊成。</p>
<p>必須負担日本佔領費用之美國，雖認爲日本關於軍事性質事件，仍須受盟軍管制，然認爲時期業已成熟，日本應在經濟上及政治上自力更生。</p>
<p>美國會公佈新證據，表示擁護此項政策之傾向，日在增加中，此項傾向之發生，可於衆院撥款委員會關於佔領區之經費諮詢中見之。舉例言之：小組委員會之主席恩格爾批評稱：「日本與朝鮮確然已不再能爲有　武危險之國家，佔領日本究爲何利，然則爲何不與之訂立條約，置身事外，而任其管理自身之事？」</p>

<h3>美記者團對日印象　日民主已萌芽？　認為日人未欺騙盟方！</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京二十日電〕應美陸軍部之邀而訪問日本之美國新聞界編輯十人，考察日本各地後，已於二十日返抵東京，定於廿二日赴朝鮮。記者曾陪同彼等考察日本各地，獲悉彼等此行所得印象如下：據英美方而非正式建議，對日和約訂成後之盟國管制機構，應由十一國遠東委員會之各國首席外交代表充任之。首席外交家之集國，較其他各式之管制機構爲要，蓋外交家對於此等問題，已有豐富經院，不易爲外界壓力所屈服。希望聯合國能設立某　軍事組織，不僅在日本和約條款時採取必要軍事揹置。</p>
<p>所有與美記者晤談之卓著人物，幾一致認爲英美與蘇聯間之戰爭　無可能。大部份盟國駐日諸領袖，皆認爲日本人民在與麥帥合作方面確有誠意。若干國家深恐日人以虛僞友誼欺騙盟方，但此慮殊屬過分。現有各項理由，可相信日本之民主確在萌芽中，日人確能成爲愛好和平之民族，且可爲亞洲各國之模範！若千權威人士深恐日本在國際市塲有與英美及其他各國競爭之慮，殊不知日本之出口可加以限制，使其不能與別國作不公平之競爭云。</p>

<h3>立委蕭錚黃元彬　談開放對日貿易　我國工商界盈重視南洋市塲</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕自監委于樹德等建議暫停開放對日貿易後，各方咸極重視。記者昨訪立委蕭錚，黃元彬等，探詢對此事之看法。二人咸認可不必過份憂懼。</p>
<p>蕭錚意見</p>
<p>蕭氏戰前曾赴日本，對日本閒題極有研究。據談：中日貿易之恢復僅爲遲早間題，有人雖反對於對日和約簽訂前與日通商，然對與日通商一點，固未反對也。在此國際自由貿易時代，中國願以相當數量之原料供給日本。有人反對以鹽及大豆運日，此舉實大可不必，蓋我國旣有剩餘，自可運往日本。就日本物資運華而論、我人反對日本將中國認作其粗製濫造工業品之尾閭，以及政治的或不正當之方式向中國傾銷易銷貨物。我人對於正常的中日貿易，不願作過份的壓制。蕭氏認日本既正努力於恢復其輕工業，然就我人觀察，日本應先設法恢復其農眾及農業加工，然後再談輾工業之恢復。記者詢以日本國際貿易開放後在爭取南洋市塲上，　我將有何種影響？蕭氏謂：就我國今後工業出路言，我人對南洋市塲，當極重視，並盼在數量上能保特相當比數，當局以前禁止棉紗運往南洋，對我實屬不利。最後蕭氏希望我國工商界在製造技術上努力改進，俾在國際市塲上與日本爭一日短長。國人才智向不後人，在機器獲得上亦較日本便利，目前雖有「高工資」之限制，然經濟情况改善後，成本目可减低，政府若更能設法減除工商界之束縛，則對外貿易非無前途。</p>
<p>黃元彬談</p>
<p>黃元彬之　法，甩　氏大致相固，渠認爲我國採取管理貿易政策，對於進出口物資之　類及數額，皆有規定　准許進口者始能入口，且不能超出限額，因之對於開放對日貿易事，不必鰓鰓過慮，蓋我國之貿易政策，決不致因日本開放對外貿易而遽加變更也。今日之局面，與抗戰前已大不同，目前我國稅已自主，因之儘可不必以過去眼光過存憂懼。黃氏認南洋市塲問　較中日貿易問題更重要，並謂，今日問題在南洋而不在中國，渠指出我對南洋向極重視，然此須視我人努力程度而定，蓋南洋並非我國人土，其市塲之獲得，有賴我人之努力。</p>
<p>朱偰談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕赴日商務考察團團員財部關務署副署長朱偰，談開放日對外貿易事稱：盟軍總部此項措施，自一般觀點而論，為互通有無，減輕佔領軍負担，原則上未可厚非，但如衡諸事實，盟總所決定之辦法實太失公平，一則以美金為買賣適用貨幣，一則以奢侈品輸出爲大宗，對我顯極不利。渠意對日貿易不妨開放，但盟總之辦法必須澈底修正，否則片面獲利之生意，孰願爲之？</p>

<p>〔中央社鄭州廿日電〕豫修防處沁河第二三程總段長王國瑞，十七日晚由黃河北來鄭。據談：共匪十六日下午向武陟屬禾樂店進犯，工程段全體員工七十餘人，三分之二均已逃往武陟縣城東南平漢路西側靠近北岸之廟工村，其餘人員下落現尚未明，武陟以西雲河南岸之東虹橋與五車口兩處堤段，因前曾決口，堤身極爲脆簿，亟需加修，五車。以東朱原村及木樂店之　岸與防禦，亦必須修築，但東虹橋村落即在共匪盤踞下，施工已甚困難，今木樂店又遭攻擊，工程無法進行，倘大汎來臨，木樂店堤身開口，該方而平漢路將受嚴重威脅。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封廿日電〕據山東修防處息：（一）黃河南岸修堤工程，朱口工程隊三隊，暫退到高村，復以劉莊及高嶺被共軍侵擾，乃於十八日退至毛店，並擬搶修該處險工。（二）臨　工程隊五隊，暫在興集集中，已與河南修防處接洽，至該處搶修險工。（三）魯西辦事處及臨濮集西部人員，均己撤退至開封。（四）臨　段所存料與工程隊用具等，均被共匪全部搶走，運至黃河北岸。</p>

<h3>社論　日本對外貿的開放問題</h3>
<p>日本私人對外貿易，根據麥帥總部的聲明，將於八月十五日起開放。我國政府對此問題的態度，迄今尚無表示，本月十八日國務會議，王外長報吿對日和會問題，亦未提及開放日本貿易問題。津滬工商界多日以來，悉感不安，認爲此時此際開放日本對外貿易，對我國必是害多利少。監察委員萬燦等，眼看事態的嚴重，大聲疾呼，請政府停止考慮開放對日貿易，並中止派遺商務代表團赴日，這呼籲已引起各方面的注意。八月十五日，轉瞬卽屆，我們對於這一事情的發展，不但不能袖手旁觀，而且應該密切加以注意，進而籌謀適當的應付辦法。</p>
<p>開放日本私人貿易，是本年六月八日，矣國務院及陸軍部聯合宣佈的；麥帥於翌日更詳細宣佈這個計劃。據麥帥聲明說：對日本之私人國外貿易，自八月十五日起局部恢復，自該日以後，准許進入日本之盟國及中立國商人，限爲四百人。所謂八月十五日，初步恢復國際貿易，號非完全恢復自由國際貿易之意，一切商業談判，均經盟軍總部作媒介，而受其國際貿易組的指導。所謂四百貿易商人，據遠東委員會所屬對日貿易會，七月三日通過的議案，四百人中包括美國一〇二人，中國及英國各六十人，印度卅九人，荷蘭及印尼廿七人，澳洲廿三人，法國及越南十六人，加拿大八人，紐西蘭及菲律賓六人，蘇聯則無一人。對於這個決定，英·菲·澳·印各國，並不感覺興味，澳洲政府堅定表示：澳國對日和約締結以前，對日私人貿易將不致恢復。澳洲的態度相當明朗，有遠識，有辦法，我們衷心共鳴。</p>
<p>日本國內工商界，對於美國此一「重大」的「賢明」的「決意」，草不彈冠相慶，莫不表示「感謝」，她們正憧憬着一九三四年的「昔日」，更目擊着中國不爭氣的現狀，她們數月來已經舉國若狂，制定了各項貿易計劃，尤其對中國的出口貨，決定了出超五千一百六十餘萬美元的巨額數字，包括出口：（一）機械類：脚路車三萬輛，空氣啷筒四萬只，手錶十萬只，攝影機十萬架，馬達五百具，紡織機三萬錠，以及火車頭農具等：（二）讖維類：蠶種紙十七萬五千箱，人造絲九千八百包，及陶器紙張木材玻璃品等：（三）農產類：雜糧，水產的魚翅海參鮑魚等，全部總值四·九六四·三六五千日元，合美金九千九百廿八萬元。至於進口貨，卽以向我購取的貨品，包括食鹽六十萬公噸，糖卅六萬公噸，大豆卅七萬公噸，煤九十萬公噸，獸毛四十萬斤，黃柏皮甘草八十九萬斤，海人草卅四萬斤，蜜臘六萬斤，茯苓三萬斤，總値二·三八四·〇九二千日元，合美金四千七百六十萬元。兩値比較，對中國的出口貿易，出超五千一百六十八萬美元。這樣的，所謂對日私人貿易的恢復，是恢復了她戰前在中國的入超市塲罷了。</p>
<p>再分析日本這個貿易計劃內容，顯然對於我國，是極端不利的。第一，貿易以美金爲準，我國有這許多的外匯麽？而且我國的外匯，由政府控制，私人貿易將從何談起？第二，日本輸入我國的，大多係劣貨，並且許多工業製成品，滾滾而來，可能破壞我民族工業生產品，前途眞不堪設想；第三，日本所需要的，皆爲我國工業原料，或民生日用必需品，現我國內不靖，災荒遍地，自身已戚物資貧乏，何來供應日本大量的需要。尤其我國出口物資，目前成本甚昂，如貿易恢復，麥帥總部不按實際成本核算，我國工商界必遭致鉅大的損失，都是有可能的事。總之，從貿易本身看中日貿易恢復，對我國是害多而利少，聯帶的技術困難重重，我們很少理由解釋，我國現階段需要對日貿易之恢復。再放遠看，現在日本軍國主義的餘毒，幷未完全肅淸，如讓她在遠東經濟圈內，仍扮演重要的角色，不僅南洋市塲將逐漸恢復其獨占性，且其結果必威脅到整個世界和古平，受影響的豈止是中國的一國麼？</p>
<p>我們站在中國人民立塲，站在維護世界和平立塲我們同意澳洲政府的態度。我們認爲，對日和約締結賠款問題解決之前，中國不需要問放對日貿易；唯有至賠償問題解決和約簽宇之後，始能恢復中日兩國的私人貿易！</p>
<h3>緬甸的政治暗殺</h3>
<p>緬甸於十九日晨，突然發生了一件驚人的政治暗殺事件：因爲仰光與外界的交通，完全中斷，事件發生的經過，雖然海沒有詳細的報導：但據英國緬甸事務部的宣佈，除了緬甸臨時政府副主席盎山當塲殞命而外，尚有部長六人同時罹難身死。消息傳至各國首都，莫不爲之震動，不僅爲緬甸喪失了一位政治領袖表示可惜，而且對於緬甸政局的前途，也不能不表示扼腕。</p>
<p>緬甸在第二次世界大戰之後，受了民族主義的洗煉，世界潮流的激盪，要求獨立與自主，爲任何人所同情的；盎山領導緬甸人民，以和平的手段與談判的方式，達到緬甸的獨立的目的，也是世人所欽佩的。盎山曾於今年一月間，率領代表團前往倫敦，與英國當局進行談判，提出三項要求：（一）英國宣佈緬甸獨立；（二）組織緬甸國民政府；（三）舉行普選，召開制憲會議。談判了好久，始有英緬協定的簽字。盎山返國後，積極進行普選，渠所領導的反法西斯人民自由大同盟，竟獲得空前的大勝，制憲曾議自四月間成立以來，也就在那裏開始進行其制憲工作了。</p>
<p>但是在另一方面，英緬協定未能使緬甸立卽獲得樹立，乃引起一部份人士的不滿，尤其是激進的共產黨，不僅其本身組有紅旗軍，而且會同緬甸獨立第一同盟的十萬「革命軍」，企圖在國內暴動，一般觀察家早就替緬甸擔憂。所以這次的政　暗殺，我們雖未明其始末，但從緬甸政局發展的軌跡看來，可知此一事件的發生，僅爲緬甸兩大黨派鬥爭的表面化而已。</p>
<p>戰後的緬甸，創鉅痛深，不論立卽獨立也好，或是再經過自治領的一個過渡時期也好，目前緬甸人民最迫切需要的，還是國內的安定；唯有在安定中始能求得進步；所以這次恐怖暗殺事件的發生，無論如何，對於緬甸的前途是有害無利的。</p>

<h3>政變猝起閣員七人慘死　緬甸前總理被捕　泰金諾新內閣宣誓就職</h3>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿日電〕緬制憲議會議長反法西斯人民自由卜盟副主席泰金諾領導之新行政委員會，已於今日宣誓就職，委員共六人均反法西斯卜盟黨員，亦昨日暗殺案中之倖免者。仰光今日局勢安臨，已在當局完全控制中，政府照常辦公，民心漸趨安定。</p>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿日電〕非正式報告謂，與殺害緬政府領袖案有關之嫌疑犯，已有八十餘人被捕，同時昨日被刺受傷之緬行政委員會邊區參事孟旁區酉長已於今晨傷重不治身死，總計遇害殞命者七人，傷者一人。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿日電〕緬甸事務部二十日報告稱：緬甸臨時政府總理盎山及閣員五人之暗殺案發生二小時以後，莫契特黨（國民黨）領袖前總理鄔沙及該黨人員十九名業已遭「保護性扣留」。傳英國警務人員在衝入鄔氏寓所之前，雙方曾開槍激戰，鄔氏下屬有三人中彈斃命，警員在鄔氏寓內搜獲步槍及手提機關槍甚多。此間緬甸人士對於該案是否係鄔沙所爲，抑係共黨所爲，意見殊爲紛歧。認爲共黨行兇者，蓋以盎山曾於六月間宣佈大部份緬共爲非法組織，另一方面，鄔沙所領導之極端國家主義派卞張完全脫離英國而獨立，因而反對盎山甚力云。</p>
<h3>緬政治暗殺經過</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕緬甸行政委員會（緬臨時政府）今日在仰光官署舉行例會時，突有暴徒多名侵入，以手提機關槍掃射，當塲擊斃緬政府領袖六人，擊傷兩人。此一謀殺消息，係由緬甸總督倫斯爵士，於今夜電知倫敦緬甸事務部。　仰光對外交通於出事後曾與外界斷絕數小時，緬督之報告有謂，「當行政委員會正開會時，有吉普一輛駛至官署正門，躍下持手提機關槍數桿及步槍兩桿者五人，逕登樓直趨會議廳，車上尚有一人留守，會議室外持槍衛隊一名欲加阻止，爲暴徒開槍受重傷，不能發言。持手提機關搶者三人，入室向與會諸領袖掃射，然後返登吉普軍逃逸。查明死者乃有行政委員會副主席盎山，商務及供應部長巴溫，敎育及設計部長巴沙克。工業及勞工部長孟巴耿。財政部長泰金密·運輸及交通部次長翁猛，傷者情報部長巴卓·邊區參事孟岡區酋長。死傷之人均已急送公濟醫院，局勢已由警察處理中，迄至目前爲止，尚未聞警察能充分控制全局，其他詳情待續報」，兇手何人現尚未有綫索。</p>
<p>按緬甸臨時政府係由十四人組成，多爲盎山所領導緬甸反法西斯人民自由聯盟之黨員。盎山乃緬甸之傑出領袖，渠在今年一月曾率遇害之泰金密。業已退出政府之巴貝·及保持獨立地位之丁杜赴倫敦，與英政府簽訂設立緬自治政府之協定。鼎杜現在倫敦，已被任爲緬駐英高級專員，當時緬代表團尚有莫契特黨領袖鄔沙·社巴馬然領袖泰金巴森，彼等則拒絕簽訂協定。自倫敦歸來後，鄔沙等兩人即聲言反對協定而退出政府。緬行政委員會近月來已享有充分之內閣職權，緬制憲議會正草制自治政府之憲法，最近通過宣布緬甸脫離英共和邦獨立之案，議員大多數爲反法西斯人民自由聯盟之黨員。議長泰金諾乃盎山之右手，共產黨則斥之爲「英帝國主義之工具」「勞工階級之出賣者」。反法西斯人民自由聯盟係由十黨派合組而成，一九四五年五月宣布有黨員十萬人，其軍事部隊曾與英軍駢肩抗日，名曰緬甸國民軍。十黨派內，初有共產黨之參加，復以共黨報紙攻擊聯盟政策，事後復拒絕道歉，乃經聯盟最高委員會於一九四六年十一月三日議決開除共產黨之參加聯盟資將。聯盟之其他黨派爲人民革命黨。莫契特黨（國民黨）。緬甸法比安黨·泰金爲·緬甸靑年同盟·大緬甸黨。森迦斯會·婦女自由同盟·及緬甸國民軍。緬督倫斯今夜廣播，宣布已任制憲議會議長泰金諾設立新行政委員會。泰金諾在緬之地位，僅次於盎山，緬督並痛責此次暴行，復請緬人保持鎭靜，追隨其領袖所佈置之獨立途徑。</p>
<p>英王電唁</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕英王及政府均已致電表示對被害緬政府要員之同情。艾德禮首相。印緬事務部次官漢特森，及該部大臣李斯托威爾勳爵。均致電緬制憲議會議長泰金諾，艾德禮並電盎山夫人，英王電緬督倫斯，表示猶憶及盎山及泰金密一月間在偷敦與其會晤時之愉快，得耗深爲悲痛，並囑代向遇害人家屬致意，並盼傷者早日痊復。英政府之電有云，得耗深爲震驚，識向緬政府及被害人家屬致深刻同情，盎山之死使緬甸失去一最大之領袖，及公僕，英政府並盼傷者早日康復。</p>
<p>英美重視</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約二十日電〕「紐約時報」與「前鋒論增報」均首頁刋登緬甸總理盎山及其五部長被刺之消息。倫敦來訊均表示共產黨人應對此暗殺事負責。同時該兩報又以顯著地位，刋載曾一度任流亡中國韓國臨時政府外交部次長呂運亨被刺之消息，呂氏被認爲朝鮮之非共產黨左派著名人士。該報謂此案共產黨亦有謀殺之嫌疑，因呂氏力岡避免共產黨人之把持，而遭受其同事中極端派份子强烈反對。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十九日電〕此間緬甸政界談稱：彼等相信盎山及其他閣員五人之被刺，係緬甸共黨所爲，蓋盎山最近會規定大部份共黨爲非法組織。除共黨以外，盎山之政敵亦反對其自由計劃，此等極端國家主養份子反對盎山最近對於英國要求之讓步云。</p>
<p>盎山略歷</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕昨日遇害之緬臨時政府副主席盎山年三十二，爲緬甸之有力人士，緬人譽其曾兩次解放緬甸，一九四二年曾助日人作戰，其後明悉日人之奸計，乃轉而助英抗日，成爲抗日領袖。渠於一九三三年入仰光大學就讀，一九三六任仰光學生會長，爲全國罷課運動領袖。去年渠發動全國罷工，反對英軍之佔領緬甸，緬政府不得已與其妥協，改組行政委員會，共產黨因此斥之爲英帝國主義之工具。</p>
<h3>前日委治島嶼　美軍政府結束</h3>
<p>美宣佈託管臨時辦法</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕白富今日宣布：杜魯門總統已簽署託管協定，由美國管理太平洋前日本委治各鳥，並任命鄧斐爾上將爲臨時管理員。鄧氏係美國太平洋艦隊總司令，將以高級專員名義管理各島，以待政府民政機構之接收。託管協定於本年四月間由聯合國機構安全理事會通過，旋經國會批准。杜魯門總統除簽署協定外，並頒發命令，規定託管地之臨時管理辦法。此項管環於本月十八日，即總統簽署兩院聯合議決案之日開始。託管島嶼爲馬紹爾·卡羅林及馬利安納諸羣島，均係美國在戰爭後期奪自日本者。總統命令一方面授　海軍部長實行暫時管理，一方面規定託管協定中所賦「美國爲安全起見可封鎖任何區域」之權力，應由海軍部長與國務卿會同執行。此外並規定聯邦各機構與聯合團各相當機構間對於託管地之一切關係，應由國務卿主持。託管區內之軍政府已由命令宣告結束。按照協定，美國須制定法律，實施所訂方案。據社魯門總統宣稱；渠已令國務院彙集立法建議，預料至下屆國會開會時即可提出。</p>
<h3>荷印局勢密雲不雨　印尼請重開和談　尼赫魯表示決支持印尼</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿日電〕印尼政府今日致函荷蘭駐印尼委員團，請其與印尼開會，和平解決懸題，或同意任命一第三國之主席（自中，英，美，法駐吧城總領中選擇之）以仲裁印荷間之爭執。印尼共和國今日並請印度根據印尼局勢威脅世界和平之理由，製具備忘錄，向聯合國安全理事會提出。日惹來報告謂，印度臨時政府副總統尼赫魯已表示由其個人負責支持印尼政府維護共和國事實上地位之政策。共和國人士，相信於印荷發生戰爭時，印度將强力支持印尼。</p>
<p>各國斡旋未獲成功</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿日電〕英國及其他盟國力事斡旋，擬使印尼當局於今日午刻前下停戰令，未獲成功。印尼總理自日惹來電話，謂其內閣不及如期成立決議，　日吧城乘火車携荷方建議返日惹之印尼副總理西提亞傑，至今晨十一時尚未抵達之故。共和國發言人責荷方不以飛機供西氏乘坐，致有此遲延。</p>
<p>荷方否認發動戰爭</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿日電〕荷印政府方面除聲明荷方無軍事用意外，並拒絕討論戰爭之可能性。荷印政府發言人承認范莫克總督已接奉海牙之覆令，但指出此點並非表示范莫克已能下令採取軍事行動。另一荷方發言人對外傳荷政府已令范莫克採取軍事行動，而范氏答以不擬於星期二以前發動之說，已予鄭重否認。</p>
<p>印尼呼籲國際干涉</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿日電〕印尼共和國政府昨夜決定緊急籲請英國，印度，澳大利亞，及阿刺伯聯盟干涉，以防印尼之與荷蘭發生戰爭。印尼政府已令駐新德里，新加坡，及康培拉之代表，分向尼赫魯，英駐東南亞特使吉能，及澳外長伊伐特，提出前項請求。同時，印尼總理夏利福亭在日惹談稱，渠覺荷方之態度已不能使印尼重新考慮其立塲。荷方對於渠之停戰呼籲廣播，一無反響，尤使其感覺失望。</p>
<p>荷軍統帥突請辭職</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙十九日電〕報紙消息，荷屬東印度荷軍總司令史波爾中將，以「荷印之軍事局勢已不復能忍，」已向荷政府辭職，然政府已予挽留。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞廿日電〕印尼外次唐齊爾今日在此間談稱：荷蘭意欲戰爭，余深信若輩不久即將進攻印尼共和國。查荷蘭已處困境，猶欲負担殖民地戰爭，實使人大惑不解。印尼仍希望目前之爭執，能和平解決、荷蘭之提案吾人已接受其五分之四，若謂剩餘的五分之一即關於組織印荷聯合憲兵隊問題，即足爲攻擊印尼之藉口，實不合情理。記者問及印尼之拯抗力量時，唐氏稱，印尼共有士兵二十五萬名，但不能有組織的對抗荷務大舉進攻。荷蘭軍配備精良，印尼勢惟有採取焦土政策耳。</p>
<h3>國際電訊會議　外蒙不準參加</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日電〕國際電訊會議於日昨在大西洋城召開全體大會時，舉行表決，反對外蒙古加入爲會員國。至是外蒙古乃未能獲得國際承認其爲一獨立共和國。日昨之表決係以三十二票對廿六票拒絕外蒙古加入，棄權者有九國。同時該會以四十六票對四十五票，表決反對立陶宛，拉脫維亞及愛沙尼亞之加入，棄權者十國。該會規定申請入會之國家須獲得三分之二之票數同意，蘇聯贊成波羅的海三國及外蒙古之加入。該會作此行動，係根據表決委會之建議，其原建議爲准許外蒙古出席會議，惟西班牙與波羅的海三國則不准參加。，</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社大西洋城十九日電〕國際電訊會議今日舉行全體會議，當以三十六票對廿一票拒絕西班牙之入會申謂。</p>
<h3>貝文闡明英政策　謂英國正播植和平種子</h3>
<p>〔路透社英格蘭諾松柏蘭郡相貝斯十九日電〕貝文外相今日在此向礦工五萬名及其家屬致辭，認爲在此一代內，當無另一戰爭之危險。</p>
<p>渠云：「本人誠摯相信吾人與蘇聯間意見之不同及猜疑心理，終能消除。吾人必能覓收方法，以聯合美國與蘇聯，以共同努力拯救整個人類。英國現正奮力播植和平之種子，一切當有賴於人民之志願。英國政府雖具淸白之聲譽，然正而臨國際上疑難之任務。本人身居外相之職，無時無刻未嘗不充分認識一錯誤之決定或判斷，甚至一任性之答覆，匪特將陷害此一代，且將害及三十年或四十年後之兒童。雖然，就余個人所見，在此一代內尚無另一戰爭之危險。余並不因渦去之困難而稍感沮喪」。貝文繼曰：「有謂余擬利用馬歇爾之建議以再造德國者，殊屬非是。德國之復興須在歐洲經濟普遍復興中實現，其間雖盈設立並維持一個標準，然尚有兩事與吾人均有影響，此乃安全如何始能確保，德國工業生產，應許其維持如何之標準，以防德國工人爲不審愼之人任意剝削，因而降低歐洲人民之生活標準。吾人必須防止歐洲人民之被剝削，或歐洲生活水準之被降低，此一平衡務須予以保持。吾人深知魯爾煤礦爲歐洲恢復繁榮之基礎，値茲煤斤缺乏之際，吾人更應使魯爾煤礦恢復正常生產。法國嘗曰：魯爾爲德國軍事實力之來源，如何可以重建魯爾。決國並以驚怖之心情而問：重建魯爾，是否將使我國第三次遭受攻擊。我英國人民亦當注意吾國之安全，吾人決不能再度面臨侵略性之德國，吾人亦決不使德國再具侵略性。於此吾人盼望美國將永勿退出歐洲」。貝文繼乃告礦工曰：君能以英國之煤供給法國，即可重建法國之經濟，在戰爭時期法國之經濟已變爲適合德國之經濟，戰爭結束以後，法國猶不能恢復其舊基礎，其原因之一，即爲英國之未能以煤斤供給法國。最後渠表示必須擊破束縛世界之循環惡現象，使經瀋得以步上正軌。渠並希望能勿再向美偕款，蓋此舉對於美及英國均屬不自然也。</p>
<p>貝文或將辭外相處理英勞工問題</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿日電〕本期「世界新聞」週刋載稱：英外相貝文或將辭去外相職務，而負責處理英國之勞動問題。貝文在戰時會處理外國勞工問題，今如重掌此任，可收駕輕就熟之效。但貝文之切實決定態度，將在對馬歇爾援歐計劃成立決議之後。</p>
<h3>英美經濟學家觀察　日將投入蘇聯懷抱</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京十九間盟國尤其是英美之經濟學家，深恐日本於獲得和約以後，將成東方之拷克斯拉夫，先在經濟上傾向蘇聯，然後在政治上投入蘇聯之懷抱。彼等預料於日本對外貿易開放後，西方國家之製造商，當不歡迎日貨之與其競爭，而蘇聯則可以吸收日本所能生產之各物，結果將使日本之貿易，自動傾向蘇聯。</p>
<p>就戰前之數字觀，在一九三四至三六年間，日本每年出口經東亞（中·韓·台灣）吸收者佔百分之四十三，亞洲全部，包括東亞在內，吸收者佔百分之六十四。而亞洲對日之輸出，佔日本全部進口之百分之五十三。美國在日本出口中，僅吸收其百分之十六，在日本進口中僅佔其百分之二十四。生絲原爲日本主要之出口，然自人造絲及尼龍纖維出現後，美國對日本之生絲，已不甚感覺興趣。以言日本紡織業，戰前惟曾稱雄於世界市塲，然據日本製造商估計，欲使其恢復一九三六至三七之水準，至少尚須十年之久，彼時印度及中國當已成堅强之勁敵。日人之唯一希望，今寄於其機械工業。朝鮮及中國，戰前爲日本之大主顧，戰後仍需要日本之機械，以復興其工業，以及賤値之日本商品，供其龐大人口之消費。今日日本需要之糧食，油類，棉花，鈞來自美國，然料佔領狀態結束，麥克阿瑟退出日本，國際貿易覓得其水準以後，日本所需之糧食，棉花，油類，將自一水之隔之蘇聯擁入；而日本之商品，亦不難在蘇聯覺得銷路，故日本終將投入蘇聯之經濟勢力圈以內云。</p>
<h3>麥帥或將參加　下屆總統競選</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕麥克阿瑟元帥參加總統競選問題，仍爲政界談論中。據稱，自南北戰爭以來，美國軍人出任總統者已有五人之衆，艾森豪威爾元帥雖一再否爲，但觀察家認爲艾帥頗有當選總統之意。除艾帥以外，麥帥似亦有參加一九四八年總統競選之跡象。對日和約如告訂成，麥帥之聲望勢必大增，並將在歡呼之下返美，預料麥帥歸期約爲明年三月。</p>
<h3>英印同時發表公告　印臨時政府改組　行合職權至兩自治邦成立為止</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕英國及印度政府本日同時在倫敦及新德里發表公報稱：印督蒙巴頓勛爵，經徵得印度各政黨領袖同意之後，業已決定設立印度臨時政府，由代表巴基斯坦及印度斯坦今後政府之二方面組織成之。此一臨時政府將行使職權，直至八月十五日爲止，屆時巴基斯坦及印度斯坦二自治領即宣告獨立。據此間人士談稱，新設之臨時政府，可使蒙巴頓總督因今後二自治領政府首長之合作而便予行事，上可便利二方面於八月十五日之分離云。</p>

<h3>擴大馬卿計劃　康納利表反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕參議院外交委員會委員民主黨外交專家康納利議員今夜廣播演說，反對擴大馬歇爾經濟援助計劃至於亞洲。康氏對討論馬歇爾計劃之巴黎十六國會議之成功表示極大懷疑。渠云：「余對歐洲國家之是否得以充分合作以執行共同計劃尚有極大懷疑。余猶未能斷定任何未來計劃是否爲應付當前局勢最好而最有效之計劃」。康氏並囑歐洲國家盡最大限度之力量以自助。渠認歐洲必須奮力工作以自救，然後美國始能易於決定應取何種行動。康氏並鄭重警告不可施行消耗過大之救濟計劃。</p>
<h3>英美對魯爾區煤斤問題　各就本國立塲據理力爭　英國正謀獲致法國支持</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：英美二國對於魯爾區問題，現正在作友好但積極之鬥爭。據官方所述，雙方爭持之立塲有如下述兩端：（一）美國認為魯爾區乃歐洲復興之關鍵，故宜致主力於此，即需要美國之技術人員監督該區煤斤生產工作，蓋美國認爲英國技術人員在該區之努力已告失敗故也。待煤斤問題處理就緒後，則美國將着手提高德國鋼之生產，至少將恢復其戰前標準。有謂此舉將危及安全問題，美國則並不以爲然，蓋中央集權可便利加以控制，萬一有何變故，則原子武器在一夜之間可使之玉石俱焚故也。（二）英國亦希望復興德國之經濟，俾英佔領區可以不致再成爲英國納稅人之負担，但英國對於美國所褐示之最後目的及其主張之辦法，則皆不表贊同。英國並不以為其技術入員之能力不及美國，且亦不願失去對魯爾區生產之控制權，故英國已拒絕參加華盛頓之兩國煤斤會議以外，美國所揭示之最後目的，英國認爲就政治觀點視之，實具有危險性，且屬違背德國所有各鄰邦之理想，故亦表反對。要知美國目前之計劃，不啻冒德國競爭之險，危及英法二國之工業。英國今爲抗衡美國起見，已在覓取法國（業已有所表示）及英國礦工之擁護。</p>

<h3>蘇發動心理戰爭　美盈以事實答覆　美參議員哈契宣稱</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十九日電〕美國民生黨參議員哈契今夜發表關於「吾國外交政策」之廣播演說稱：蘇聯所發動之心理戰爭，美國必須以具體事實加以答覆之。倘爲歐洲奠定合宜之復興計劃，美國尤不應節省其援助歐洲之努力。此舉殆將使美國遭遇重大之犧牲，犧牲之一種，即我國政府在此援助期間，或需相當的管理經濟是也。或謂美國具有經濟帝國生義野心，殊非事實，吾人所將忍受之犧牲，將為任何人所不能補報。要知美國所要求其他國家者，惟欲使之接受民主政治原則，保障個人自由，故彼等倘獲實行經濟復興，則皆屬美國援助之功，理應忠實遵行聯合國之原則云。</p>

<h3>勞軍大會昨舉行　當塲捐獻者踴躍　上海能安居盈歸功前方將士　希望各盡國民責任響應募捐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市各界剿共建國萬元勞軍大會，於昨晨九時在大光明大戲院舉行。主席團計為市長吳國楨，黨部主委方希孔，警備部司令宣鐵吾，議長潘公展（項昌權代），師營區司令傳正謨，三民主義青年團吳紹澍（曹俊代），警察局長俞叔平，總工會水祥雲，商會杜月笙（王先青代），農會候　人，婦女會田淑君，社會局吳開先（李劍華代），工協會吳蘊初，黨部書記長謝仁釗，民政處張曉崧，童軍理事會副總幹事范曉六，及甫自新疆來滬之立法委員華聲謨等。參加大會之各界代表達千餘人。情緒至為熱烈</p>
<p>大會開始，行禮如儀，全體爲前方剿匪陣亡將士默念三分鐘。</p>
<p>主席吳市長就位致詞略調：上海人士因工商事業忙，且離前綫路遠，恐對於剿共建國無深刻感覺。但我們仔細想一想，上海以及國家經濟困難日益增多，其原因何在？本人並非武斷地說，乃因共黨叛國作亂之結果，根據本人一年來處理事務之經騐可證明：</p>
<p>共黨擾亂國家造成糧荒煤荒</p>
<p>（一）糧食問題，去年今年米價高漲，乃因產量供應不足，但如何會不足呢？則因共黨盤踞江北，在被國軍擊退時，將所有糧食搶去，吃光，農田摧毁。江北一帶同胞之米糧，本可自給，其後不得不到江南無錫等地採購，而上海食米向由無錫蚌埠等地大量供應，現僅能供給一部份，致造成米荒情形。（二）以燃料而言，共黨把山東及中興煤礦用水俺沒，又把毫無政治關係之技術人員殘殺，企岡阻止生產，擾亂國家，據中興經理於去年冬報告稱，復工之機器設備雖已備齊，但煤礦抽水工作須於今年三月始吿完成，故在該時期中，煤斤又成恐慌。至其他如食油棉紗等，亦均因共黨破壤產田及交通，而無法南運。</p>
<p>但比較而言，上海市民已極僥倖，尚能亦居樂業，此點應歸功前方將士·東北義勇將士將四平街共軍擊退而使滬上物價免於狂漲，即一確實證明。故希望上海四百萬市民都能化去五分鐘時間想一想，是否應響應勞軍募捐以盡國民一份子之責任。</p>
<p>我們必須達成百億勞軍目的</p>
<p>繼由方生委致詞略稱，我們要救中國，使中國和平統一，必須要先消滅共產黨，否則共產黨將毁滅中國，毀滅中國即將毀滅全世界民族。我們今日如袖手旁觀，將來即是坐以待斃，試想一想，共產黨若到上海來後，我們還能過太平的日子嗎？前方將士現在正在爲我們流血，我們若一無表示，如何對得起他們？所以我們必須要達成一百億勞軍的目的，使他們覺得後方人民未曾忘了他們，作戰流血也是値得的。尤其是中國國民黨員，更應以身作則，爲民前鋒，國民黨手創中華民國，又領導抗戰，今日決不能坐視中華民國被毁滅。此外並希望靑年黨，民社黨同胞共同合作，希望盟邦，尤其是美國能多多發揮經濟力量，共同達到世界和平。而對於共黨尾巴企圖破壞我們這運動者，則應向其警吿，這種人即是上海當前的敵人。</p>
<p>潘議長因應邀在無錫開會，故由項秘書長昌權代表致詞，闡述渠於民二十三年親身在江西安徽目睹共軍暴行之經歷。　旋由曹俊，宣鐵吾，華聲謨，傅正謨等致詞，均希望各界饗應勞軍運動。華氏並闡述新疆共黨勾結某國擾亂之事實。</p>
<p>大會決議·通電致敬</p>
<p>最後由吳市長提出，經大會通過，以大會名義即電主席擁護總動員令，電社聿明，陳明仁將軍以及四平街作戰將士致敬，電全國各地剿共軍官將士致敬，電新疆軍政官長請予保衛國土。並由方主委領導高呼口號後散會。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕萬元勞軍捐募定二十五日開始，但昨日勞軍大會舉行時，即有若干市民踴躍獻捐，由吳市長報吿，首先捐款者爲富新廣播公司工友呂家棟，呂家樑，李鴻　，孫裕慶等四人，共捐二十萬元。繼由大光明戲院捐三百萬元，閘北某小學校長王金城捐五萬元，憲兵第二十三團新聞室李主任捐半月薪金十五萬元，龍華寺僧人心慈以節食五萬元捐助，和平日報全體職工捐三百萬元。市黨部直屬廿區分部十萬元，天　·天利·天原三廠全體職工每人一萬元，石料工程公會五十萬元，及其他團體，私人等所捐均極踴躍。</p>
<h3>復員軍官轉業　六十一人　服務兩路</h3>
<p>復員軍官轉業交通人員分發在兩路實習者，計有二批，第一批爲南京中訓團之二十七人，第二批爲西安中訓團之三十四人，共計六十一人，其中又分運轍，工程，機械三組，業已先後分別至該路報到，分派於各單位實習。按戰後復員官兵解甲轉業，從事於各項建國工作，在我國尚屬首創，路局對該批實習人員，頗爲重視。陳局長特於日前召集全體轉業軍官訓話，對於各人過去受訓經過，及現在實習狀况，垂詢甚詳。最後並勉各學員仍本過去爲國犧牲精神，繼續努力建國工作。</p>

<p>工黨活動·已失民望</p>
<p>記者與該團團員多人洽談甚詳，茲綜誌大要如次：目前在南洋各地之華僑政治生活與戰前顯然不同，戰前南洋華僑殊少參加政治生活，及戰時南洋各地淪陷，共產黨乘機大事宣傳，並組織抗日軍。勝利後，政府仍許共產黨繼續活動，終以其行動越軌，形同叛國，人民乃洞燭其奸，今已大失民望。再如戰前華僑備受英人壓迫，戰後我國國際地位提高，得以享受公民權。惟此項公民權限制甚嚴，其條件必須（一）留居當地二十五年以上，（二）能說並須能寫英文或馬來亞文話者。今日一般僑胞，其父輩以上多能說而不能寫，故得享受所謂公民權者，實係少數。戰後復以英人利川當地國共矛盾，離間僑胞關係，影響華僑團結至大。</p>
<p>缺乏機器·生產銳減</p>
<p>其次華僑經濟生活，均以生產隊膠·錫·鑛爲業，戰後缺乏機器，生產量銳减，而生活費用較戰前高達十倍，工人要求提高特遇，資方頗感難以應付。其最嚴重者，爲南洋各地普遍發生米荒，馬來亞政府實行統制配給，每人月需米三十斤，配給僅得八斤。當局許可華僑前往泰國，印度。爪哇·緬甸等處自由運購百分之二十，故仍不敷所需，工人工資完全隨米價而定。至於南洋華僑之文化敎育，各地小學最爲普遍，二十歲以下，八歲以上者皆可講國語，高中爲最高學府，僅新加坡有英文大學一所。</p>
<p>婦女守舊·一如內地</p>
<p>中文報紙有南洋商報，星洲日報兩家，水準較高，言論公正，其他尚有中國報，民聲報兩家地方性報紙。英文報紙頗多，全爲英國政府所辦，對於我國戰事消息，儘量刊登，且大事渲染，影響不識中文之華僑者甚鉅。婦女生活，守舊一如內地，社會上殊少婦女工作。最後渠等表示，希望國內早日統一和平，華僑無不赤忱愛國，凡有利於國之政黨，皆予擁護。反之，則無論其爲任何政黨，均予反劉到底。</p>

<h3>滬出現飛盤　原來是氣球　范家康君詳告追究經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於飛盤光臨上海之謎，頃據美國合衆福無綫電報務員兼江灣無綫電台報務員范家康君來函略稱：「本人於前晚（十九日）偶在江灣無綫電台內瞥見一發光物體，自西北向東移動，離開地約一萬呎高，當即招呼在塲之美軍數人共同觀望，歷時約二十分鐘。初時余以爲此物殆即最近喧傳一時之飛盤，但美軍均不以爲然，而指其爲測候用之氣球。余信疑參半，爰於昨晚親詣江灣機塲去國陸軍空運站調查此事，據稱該處的確無分畫夜施放測候氣球，以預測氣象，入夜氣球上並載有燈火。旋該站經向前夜班人員查詢後，以電話通知本人，謂該站曾於十九日半夜放出測候氣球一枚云云。故余信報紙所載飛盤之說，當係誤傳。」</p>
<h3>農地改革實施之日即為內亂敉平之時　祝平播講戡亂建國與農地改革</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座大同電台，舉辦第十六次星期日特別廣播，請市地政局長祝平播講「戡亂建國與農地改革」，茲節錄演詞如下：</p>
<p>我國經八年艱苦抗戰之後，復員工作，尚未就緒，現在又不得不實行動員，戡亂實在是一件不幸之事，但爲保衛地方秩序，保護民族生存，武力戡亂，旣無法避免，我人站在國民一份子之立塲，唯有集中意志，統一力量，擁護國策，以期內亂之早日敉平，使動員的時間能縮短至最低限度，使戡亂的犧牲减少至最低限度。</p>
<p>農村崩潰邪說亂行</p>
<p>目前內亂之因素雖頗爲複雜，但其卞要德結所在，則爲「農民問題」的未獲解決，蓋以中國至今仍爲一農業國家，最大多數的人口爲農民最主要的生產爲農業，即城市的產業工人以及軍隊的士兵，莫非來自農村，政權之　　，輒繫於農民之向背，故解決農民問題，實爲解決整個中國問題之鎖鑰。而農民問題之核心，則爲「土地問題」。國父孫中山先生在四十年以前，就提出「平均地權」的綱領，爲革命之主要標的，在二十年以前，復提出「耕者有其田」之政策，以爲解決農民問題的具體方針，實具有　智之遠見。惜乎二十年來，此項重要國策，尚未能切實推行，以致農村經濟日就崩潰，多數農民流離失所，異端邪說，遂乘隙而入，廣大的農村輒爲共黨所盤踞，以爲興兵作亂的根據地，此實乃吾國內亂之根源所在，故解決土地問題，乃目前根絕亂源穩定社會之唯一出路，若捨此不圖，則恐將治絲益紊</p>
<p>解放經濟提高生活</p>
<p>解決土地問題，原爲中山先生妙國的國策，因遲遲未能實施，致善良的農民，竟爲邪說所誘惑，廣大的農村，竟爲匪徒所竊據，言之殊可扼腕。茲經明令動員，實行戡亂，自應標本兼治，尤宜針對擴結之所在，肅消亂源，以收事半功倍，一勞永逸之效。至於解決土地問題之具體方策，則莫若實行土地資金化方案，（該案係本人提出於國民黨第六次全國代表大會，經大會熱烈通過，並經蔣主席指定爲必須實行之要案，己由中央令行各有關部會）·其進行步驟有三，第一爲舉辦農村及佃業經濟調查，第二爲實行聯合繳租及聯合征租，同時調整田賦負担，第三爲轉移土地資金爲工業資金。至該方案之主旨，在使農民獲得經濟上的解放，俾提高其生活，並得有餘力從事於改進生產，同時予以金融上技術上之協助，並輔導農民之組織，以從事集體耕作，藉以提高生產率增加生產量，一面建立倉庫網，使全國糧食可以隨時調節，而無虞匱乏。</p>
<p>土地資金移轉建設</p>
<p>至在地主方面，則可以獲得其應有之地似，同時由政府保本保息，輔導其投資於工業，使原有呆滯於土地上之資金，轉移於工業建設。據我估計，此項可運用之土地資金之總額，爲數甚鉅，若以目前幣値計算，約可得九百萬億元，若分配於十五年的期間，以運用此項資金，則每年可有六十萬億之巨額資金，以從本於工業建設。故實行土地資金化方案，不特可以解決土地問題，安定農村秩序，繁榮晨業生產，司時復可　集工業資金，以促進我國工業化之推行。</p>
<p>我國土地問題若能獲得解決，則農民生活旣能改進，農村經濟　而繁榮，而工業建設復能日就發展。　個國民經濟旣能蒸蒸日上，則彼城狐社鼠復何所憑籍，異端邪說更何由而入，杜絕亂源的治本大計，其在斯乎，此以作者很堅定的說，「農地改革實施之日，即爲內亂敉平之時」。</p>

<h3>廣播特別節目</h3>
<p>昨本報舉辦第十六次特別廣播，自上午九時開始，鍾志和醫師主講「肺癆病人症狀的分析」，林樂生講「宗敎講座」，下午一時三十分至二時，請口琴名家王慶隆奏曲，二時至二時五十分，請包寒英小姐講「兒童故事」，四時十分宓錫通律師講「商人對商號應有之法律觀點」，五時至五時卅分王爵榮醫師講「產前與產後」。七時至九時係同聲曲社之貿曲，九時至十二時，因與原定節目，大有更改，結果反益稍妙，如張哲生君顯文芍君大同電台老閣劉春華君，臨時湊播提放，朱敏小姐之汾河灣，包式先，張哲生·范石人三君賣馬，李薔華薇華姊姊分別播唱荒山淚及審頭，沈柏年·包式先君之女起解，由倪秋萍在若其兩君合奏胡琴，富榮華小姐駡王朗，何時希·張哲生·包式先·顧文芍四君之羣英會，自蔣幹過江起盜書止，陳德珍君之洪羊洞，侯梅生君甘露寺。此外復承名敷侯梅生，名琴師趙　羹，富葆靑沙紹春，屢爲本報特別廣播帮忙，有時司鼓，有時操絃，際此盛暑逼人，揮汗如雨，熟忱殊覺可感。至旅客登記簿上所書之四川路八十七號地址，嗣經查明實係虛構。　又當警局調查時，張嘗謂此女居於香粉弄十號，迨前往偵詢，亦無此事。綜上所述，前後情形頗多不實之處，故眞相如何，尚在繼續偵查中。</p>

<h3>科學時代的「嫘祖」　「雲絲」發明人雲鶴博士　是工業胃裡有數的女性人才</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕我們不能不承認，近幾年來，中國婦女在社會上工作的範圍以及所貢獻的成續，已一天天在擴大起來。不僅在敎育。文化。政治。社會·　學。法律等各方面證明女子和男子同樣地能勝任重大的工作，即工商實業界，亦有女子領導的事業，中國　業公司總經理　雲鶴博士（見圖）就是一個例子。</p>
<p>女士的担任中國蔴業公司總經理，並非因爲她擁有家產，開　大商店掛個名就做起老闆娘來，而是她十多年來潛心研究蔴纖維所得的結果。民國十四年·鄭女士畢業北平女子高等師範，十六年即赴美國深造，先後在美國歐海歐·米歇根·支加哥大學肄業，得歐海歐大學化工博士學位。可是她仍感到學識經騐之不足，出校後又到各地旅行攷察工業。二十一年，赴歐洲攷察，是年秋返國在北平燕京大學祖任化學敎授，二十二年又到德國在柏林大學，德國大城市各工廠學校內實習，研究。那時候，　女土即開始研究蔴（外人稱爲中國草China　Grass因以中國產量最多），一方面並以稻草，甘蔗渣等作爲人造絲原料，而在認爲苧蔴中發現有質地甚好的纖維可作紡織原料，無須將其毁壞後再製成人造絲及人造纖維。</p>
<p>發明雲絲　　政府準予專利</p>
<p>民二十五年返國後，　又　續不斷地作深刻研究，由蔴中用化學方法提取總　維，即變成又像棉花又像絲棉般雪白柔　的東西，　女士稱它爲「雲絲」，因爲撕開後一朶朶像天上的賓彩一般。後來她把雲絲彈織成棉絮，在重慶遷川工廠舉行展覽會時林故主席曾替它取了個名字呌做「雪裏春，」即形容雪白柔　暖溫的意思。這種「雲絲」乃　女士所發明，已獲得政府准許專利。「雲絲」的功用，可以織成各種布，毛中，夏季穿制服料，西裝或女外衣料，沙發套，棉絮等等，當記者造訪時，　女士把各種樣品拿給記者看，的確和薄呢嗶嘰差不多，其優點在無皺，凉爽，輕　，且因化學製成，極爲衛生，其成本則比棉花略貴，而不及絲棉四分之一的價格。</p>
<p>計劃在各地設廠製造</p>
<p>中國蔴業公司在去年四月成立，資本二億元，由中·中·交·農·四行中央信託局，中山文化協會郵匯局及其他企業公司等各機關協助，董事長即孫副主席，代表中山文協公司現尚未正式開業。但在重慶該公司已有製造廠、每天可產「雲絲」三至四噸。同時在上海，漢口，香港，廣東都設有辦事處。目前則因正在割蔴時期，由各辦事處分赴湘·鄂·川·贛·滇·等產蔴地收購，一方面籌備今年冬季大量製造「雲絲」。並希望運銷國外。在廣東，省政府打算把機器，廠房供給中國蔴業公司，與之合作，目前正在商談中。以後在上海，香港·漢口等各地均計劃設立分廠。</p>
<p>此外，　女士對於人造絲依舊有極大的興趣，民二十五年曾籌劃中華人造絲廠，後因戰爭而吿停頓。但她表示一有機會，仍想在這方面再有發展。</p>
<p>家學淵源·夫婦同道</p>
<p>女士是山東濟南人，父親平年在山東任工程師，這對於她自幼即對科學，工業發生興趣有很大的影響。而這許多年來能够堅特她的毅力，則是她母親的力量。她認爲一個人辦事業，須要有道德的基礎，她的道德基礎，即是母親所給與的，可惜老人家在她讀中學時即已故世。她的丈夫熊子麟，也是德國柏林大學化工博士，現在重慶任西南化學工業製造廠總經理，眞可謂志同道合的一對夫婦。</p>
<p>至於纖維化學使她發生興趣的基本原因，乃是她覺得纖維的用途實在太廣，衣及用品中許許多多的東西，都是由纖維造成，就是用來作戰的火藥也是纖維製成，所以，在戰時可以保衛國家，在平時亦可以裕國利民，這類的工業實有提倡的必要。她並說，女子須有切實的學識，才能談得上獨立，像人造絲等製造工作，百分之九十要由女工來祖任。婦女界對於工商業的貢獻將有驚人表現，祗要給予她們機會。</p>
<h3>夫子廟宴客被捕　張肖龍曾為虎倀　高檢處訊明提起公訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕張靑龍，原籍安徽南陵，後移居瀋陽，日本帝大畢業。卅一年在滬附逆，曾充上海敵憲兵隊密探長兼梅機關翻譯，謀害中央地下工作人員甚多，蔣伯誠及楊虎失人之被捕，亦係該逆所密報。張性極淫，經常往來舞廳，當時所謂紅縣女被其姦汚者不知儿幾。勝利後化名美新，匿跡南京，旋任後勤部鎭江倉庫副庫長，於去年五月廿五日在南京夫子廟小巴黎酒家宴客被捕，初由後勤部軍法處審辦，嗣因張犯罪地點在上海，遂移解本市高檢處偵查，頃由高檢處偵查結果，以張有觸犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款第八款之罪，依法提起公詐。</p>

<h3>中國旅行社發售　浙贛路聯運車票</h3>
<p>自浙贛鐵路趕工搶修通車以來，旅客咸稱便利，惟以由滬赴杭轉搭浙贛路之旅客，往往因在杭停留時間太促，不及趕購該路車票，致作無謂之延擱。茲悉：本埠中國旅行社，爲便利行旅起見，已興浙贛鐵路當局洽妥，自本月二十日起，由該社發售由滬至浙贛路沿綫各大站聯運車票，暫以　山，諸曁，義鳥，金華，蘭谿五站爲限。旅客到杭後，即可搭乘浙贛路下午一時三十分所開之對號入座車，旣免無謂延擱，又可預留車座，一舉兩得，誠旅客之福音也。</p>
<h3>泰山療養院長　被控虐待遺棄　結識日女同居　毆打髮妻成傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕林森中路泰山療養院院長林伯輝，因姘識日婦，虐待髮妻，遺棄子女，其妻前日向地檢處騐傷，幷提起訴訟。據訢狀稱：材伯輝，福州籍，現年四十八歲，幼年由其叔父日籍商人林慶春撫養，受日本敎育，卒業於南滿醫學院，戰前曾在福州博愛醫院內充當內科醫生，後在福州南台設城南醫院，妻齊光玉，係福建師範學校畢業，結婚已二十三年，共育子女八人。抗戰未發生前，福建省主席陳儀，以林熟諎日語，資送林往日本九洲帝國大學醫科深造，林於廿九年得醫學博士學位，攜帶一日本女護士疋田登喜子同來上海，於四馬路中興大樓開設診所，旋即與疋田登喜子姘居於虹口。時福州淪陷，齊氏母子流亡來滬，林對其妻兒生活竟置之不顯，其妻遂住於母家，後林憑其姘婦疋田喜子與敵偽勾結之力，乃取得林森中路房屋一座，開設泰山療養院，自任院長，并於威海衛路賃得哈同房屋一幢，改名林邨，作爲住宅。經齊光玉母家之交涉，齊氏母子乃亦遷入共住，但時爲林及其姘婦毆打，勝利後疋田登喜子化名卒榕蘭，仍匿居於泰山療養院內。最近齊氏往取生活費時，又被林毆打成傷，齊氏不堪虐待，日前往地檢處騐傷，由郁懿新檢察官傳訊兩造偵查一過，諭知改期再訊。</p>

<h3>杭敎次昨招待本市記者　當前敎育問題　當晩夜車返京最近期內仍將來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敎育部次長杭立武，於昨日下午五時，在本市祁齊路三二〇號中央研究院，招待各報記者。敎部督學陳東原，隨同出席。杭次長於席間報告當前有關敎育各問題：</p>
<p>基本敎育問題</p>
<p>（一）聯合國文敎組織遠東區基本敎育研究會議，定於九月一日至十二日在南京舉行，敎育部爲此已召開預備會議，並柬邀菲律濱，印度，越南，緬甸，暹羅等十一單位參加，日本不在內。會議結束後，自十三日起開始旅行參觀，十五日來上海，約有三天逗留。本人此次來滬，已與市敎育局接洽籌備參觀事宜，期於遠東各國彼此觀麼後，能使基本敎育推行普及。基本敎育之意義，包括國民敎育，民衆教育，與社會敎育。使人民於識字之外，尚需有民族意識，生產技能，科學與衛生之常識。此與我國憲法所規定之敎育宗旨，使有公民道德，國家意識，健全體格，科學常識，與生產技能相同。所謂「貧·病·愚·私」，爲中國之四大敵人，今使有生產按能除貧，健全體格除病，敎育識字除愚，公民意識除私，此不僅爲敎育問題，亦爲立國基本問題，故墓本敎育實爲建國時期中之主要工作。當今國家正走上民主之路，吾人可提倡「敎育爲民主」之口號，其意義亦即包括上述之數點。故基本敎育，實爲中國當前敎育上最大之需要，除以最簡便方式使國民識字外，並利用敎育電影敎育廣播等最新之科學方法，以求推廣普及。</p>
<p>學校設備問題</p>
<p>（二）復員後中國敎育如何能使有進步最重要者猶在岡書儀器文具之設備。其中如雜誌可供科學研究之用，歐美各國皆整套齊備。我國則因經抗戰關係，或有遺失，或外國不米，致殘缺不全，不易明瞭其過程階段。敎育部前因政府外匯缺少，經與善後救濟總署及聯合國機構商洽撥款四百萬美金，以作購買圖書儀器文具之用。後動用至三百二十萬時，政府將餘款購買棉花。至今訂購之圖書儀器文具中，工科用具部份已有九百餘箱於日前運滬，存於交通大學。敎育部特組織分配委員會，負責檢查與分配工作，將來全國收復區工學院皆可有一套用具分得。其他訂購之農科醫科用具皆有，俟年內到達後，即次第分配各校。敎育部將繼續向政府請款，並以其他方式設法外匯，以便續向國外訂購國害儀器文具，充實各校設備。</p>
<p>建築校舍問題</p>
<p>（三）各校敎授及學生人數，較戰前皆增加數倍，原有校舍，均不敷應用。敎育部爲此數度要求追加經費，充作國立學校必要建築之用。政府因經費有限，儘量籌款，最近已決定撥款六百五十億元。本人此次來滬，曾向各校作一調查，將來亦可分配得一部分建築費用。杭次長報告完畢後，各報記者紛紛提出詢問，經杭次長逐一答覆如下：</p>
<p>留學考試問題</p>
<p>（一）關於留學問題，現今國內有兩種不同見解，其一認爲國內需要人才，應先充寬國內敎育機構，一方面亦可减少外匯之流出。其一則認爲國內程度不够，應大量派送出國。敎育部目前所行則爲折衷辦法，即根據實情酌量派送出國，我國留學制度，始自一八七二年，至今已有七十餘年歷史，當初因無整個計劃，故成績未如理想。個人認爲建國需要人才，留學洵為必需，故去年及今年對有機會出國者皆儘量帮忙。惟因國家財力有限，去年考取自費留學之一千餘人，即需外匯四百萬美金，故敎育部雖感覺人才需要，然事實上亦有困難。本年暑期內，不擬舉行自費留學考試。譯員留學考試及格名單雖已發表，惟目前尚在接洽就讀學校中，年內恐不可能放洋。</p>
<p>敎授解聘問題</p>
<p>（二）上海一部份國立大學解聘敎授事，據本人所知，敎育部絕對未曾授意。敎育部旣委任校長爲一校負責人，對校長當絕對信任，包括聘任敎授問題在內。敎部對各校所聘敎授名單不需送看，亦未有向各校提出名單授意解聘。敎部信任校長，而校長於每學年考核後有權斟酌決定敎授之是否續聘。現今英國各大學對聘任敎授事，由校內成立之委爲會討論決定。國內淸華大學，亦有此組織。個人認爲中國敎育需要科學進步與學術自由，無論敎授與學生，皆需明瞭民主國家之國民有其權利，亦有義務。各人對某事看法雖可不同，但對服務與所在之學校可有建設性之建議，而不可有破壞性之行動。學生爲將來國家之主人翁，其行動無論如何，不能超越法律之外。學術自由，校內政治思想可不同，但不必有罷課等行動。如著名之英國劍橋與牛津大學，各人對政治之意見儘可相異，但從未聞有罷課多少天之事。現國內總動員令下後，各黨派如有違背行動，無論何人皆將法辦。</p>
<p>被捕學生問題</p>
<p>（三）上海彼捕學生問題，本人此次來滬非爲此事。但已儘量與黨政機關各方面接洽，希對情節輕者能早日保釋。（四）市敎育局長顯毓　辭職，已加挽留。一部份大學校長辭職，或因校內情形複雜，難於處理，現敎部對此，正在商洽中。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕杭次長爲下學期續聘敎授問題，於昨晚邀集有關各院校負資人商談，當晚夜車返京。據杭次長向記者表示：最近期內仍將來滬一行。</p>
<h3>現任小學敎師　兵役規定緩召</h3>
<p>〔南京廿日電〕關于現任小學敎師任職一年以上經審查合格，但非師範學校畢業者，或係師範學校畢業，經審查台格，而任敎未滿一年以上者；以及初中畢業，經登記合格之現任代用敎師，可否援照兵役法第廿六條二款之規定，申請緩召一事，國防部頃解釋稱：關于小敎緩召之規定，文義旣明，可准遵照辦理，刻特通令各省市兵役主管機構辦理。</p>
<h3>英大敎授幾全留任</h3>
<p>比照京滬區第一級待遇</p>

<h3>康省推進女子師敎　情形特殊女生來源不易　恪遵中央指示逐步展</h3>
<p>〔本報康定專訊〕西康敎廳，頃奉敎部代電，以推廣女子師範敎育，曾通行各省市推進有案，現値實施戰後各省市五年師範敎育方案時期，各省市自應按照原令，織續積極推行，以期完成，飭遵辦具報。據悉原令所示：（一）各省市應以劃定之師範學校區，每區必須達到設立男女師範各一　所爲原則，如每區已設有兩個師範學校，應予各校內添設女子師範部，以推廣女子師範敎育。（二）各省應察酌各縣地方情形，於各省適當縣份。推設女子師範學校，並在已設簡易師範學校縣份，增設女子簡易師範班，以收容小學畢業之女生，如各省簡易師範學校中有適合男女同班敎授者，仍應照舊案辦理，不必更張。（三）三十五學年度起，各省應增設獨立女子師範學校若干所，招收初中或小學畢業之優秀女生。（四）原有獨立女子師範或女子簡易師範，宜儘量增加班次。（五）女師校長以女性爲原則。復查本省女子師範敎育，早經恪遵敎育部曁中央指示，注意推廣。按本省實際情形，首在已設各師範學校及簡易師範學校，男女同班敎授，儘量擴充女子名額，次第增設女子師範班及簡易師範班，再單獨設立女子師範學校，及簡易師範學校，以期徐圖推廣。惟以本省情形特殊，各級女子敎育，尚在萌芽時期，增設女子師範班及簡易師範班，招收女生困難，單獨設立女子師範學校及簡易師範學校，學生來源更屬不易。三十四年秋季，曾以將省立康定師範學校改辦女師，列入本省調整師範敎育方案辦理，經敎部核備在案。無如首屆招收女生一班，即不足額，嗣後女生來源更必寥寥，經呈奉敎部准予緩辦女師在案。似此情形，今後本省女子十師範敎育之推進，仍擬本前述徐圖擴展原則辦理，併入本省第三次師範敎育方案，作爲實施重點。聞敎廳已將此種情形，覆請敎部核示。</p>

<h3>部編小學掛圖　湘省請公開廠權</h3>
<p>〔長沙航訊〕本省國民敎育協曾，以國定本教科書版權旣已公開，其配合教科書之掛圖，自應一併由坊間自由印行。此項掛圖前次曾由敎部編繪，交由新亞書店印售，計有兒童衛生圖，起居規律圖，社交禮儀圖等多種，售價甚昂，各地又無發行網，一般學校無法購到，因此特呈敎部一併公開版權，庶免礱斷，而救書荒，一面併先就地翻製印刷，頗爲精美，每套售價僅及原定價十分之三，各校頗爲歡迎。</p>

<h3>中小學優良敎師　均不得無故解聘　敎部電飭各省市知照</h3>
<p>〔中國社南京廿日電〕頃據敎部消息，秋季開學不久將屆，各地中小學敎師，其中甚多從事，敎育事業已十有餘年，專心致志於造就學生學業之發揚光大，旣不競競於個人名利得失，更能於目下敎師生活極度清苦中堅守崗位。此種人員，在我國今日敗壞之社會風氣下，極應有以扶持，在校方當局更須保障其此種淸寒自守之最低生活。惟查目下一般私立學校，對敎師之與請，完全憑校長私有之友誼，或某種利害關係決定，即一部份旣已聘請敎師續聘與否，校長並不以其敎學成績決定，使終身以獻身敎育事業者，因考慮下學期生活，引起惶惶不安，此項情形，不僅私校普遍存在，即一部公立學校亦然。况今日社會，到處人浮於事，其中一部份毫無經騐，因校長私人關係，亦竟濫竿充數，而將一批對敎界有充分貢獻之敎師，無故解聘，影響敎育事業，甚非淺顯。除通電各國立中學不得無故解聘，應於學期開始前二個月發出聘書外，特再電飭各省市主管敎育廳局，對敎師之聘請，應切實負責管理，並轉令各縣公私立中小學校長知照。</p>

<h3>國內國外市價懸殊　桐油產銷受威脅</h3>
<p>美洲諸國又積極增產亞蔴仁油</p>
<p>美國及南美洲諸國，近正積極改良桐樹之栽培，及加工製造亞蔴仁油，以代替桐油。一般均以此將予我國桐油銷路以莫大威脅。</p>
<p>據桐油業者談稱：我國桐油，目前根本無法出口，國內價格每噸漲至六十餘萬元，而國外價格每噸僅廿餘萬，相差懸殊，自無法成交。中央信託局現宣佈以六十二萬之市價收購，此亦非長久之計，而美國與南美洲，本是世界產亞蔴仁油最多之國家，南美洲過去亞蔴仁油十筆交易，銷出十二萬噸之多十由此可見其產量豐富之情形。</p>
<p>但亞蔴仁油製造油漆，其質料較桐油差多，若求製造精細之油漆，仍需採用桐油。而我國爲桐油產量最多之國家，我國之桐汕，並非無法增產，實乃無人計劃增產，而任其產量逐减。戰前每年可輸出十餘萬噸，但在戰後，如去年度僅輸出二萬八千餘噸，結匯二千七百萬美金，與戰前相左甚遠。</p>
<p>本年度輸出略有增加，在一月至四月間，已輸出三萬噸，目前在中信局收購下，還可輸出一部份，但仍不能趕上戰前。如此若謀加强產銷，爭取國外市塲，必須由政府指定專員，總籌計劃，否則桐油產銷之前途，難期樂觀云。</p>
<h3>黑市匯率已形減低　外流資金漸見歸返</h3>
<p>最近國內因北方局勢關係，圾生大量資金逃避之現象，東北及平津等地，鉅額資金紛紛集中上海，再由上海經廣州厦門，逃往香港。同時並有多量現鈔走私華南，致使華北金融籌碼，大感缺乏，本市亦發生現鈔恐慌。而由滬匯往廣州厦門匯率，國家行局每千元曾提高至九十五元最高額。商業銀行高達一百五十元，而墨市匯率更足驚人，竟一度達三百六十元。</p>
<p>茲據中央銀行方面息：自國內局勢轉穩後，資金逃避之事，已告停止，且有循原途歸返迹象，故數日來匯粵款項驟减，黑市匯率亦大爲减低。目前已與國家行局匯率相差無幾，而向平津匯款反有增加云。</p>
<p>又訊：現因華南廣州油頭等處，發生現鈔貼水，最高峯時每億元現鈔竟可換得一億三四千萬元之鉅，故本市商人頗有以種種方式，携帶巨額現鈔出境牟利，故財政當局對本市匯往粵閩等省之匯款，已予嚴格限制。</p>
<p>惟商人因現鈔套利一事，有利可圖，爲逃避當局耳目，故已改變路綫，一綫由滬匯往漢口轉衡陽，一綫由滬匯往昆明轉梧州，然後再集中廣州經營。</p>
<p>是項特殊交易，據悉當局爲進一步限制起見，對滬漢間匯兌，已規定每週不得超過五千萬元，如有正當用途，超過此一數字，須辦申請手續，以憑審核云。</p>
<h3>繅絲貸款　四聯已核準</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二十日電〕據經濟部負責人談稱，本年春季貸款收繭，業已辦竣，計蘇浙兩省及皖北共收鮮繭約二十萬担。蠶絲協導委會以現時急待繅製生絲，經分呈經濟農林兩部並函四聯總處，按照鮮繭二十萬祖約可製成生絲一萬四千担。每祖生絲約需繅工費六百萬元計算，請予貸款八百四十億元，最近已得四聯總處核准照貸。</p>
<h3>台糖推銷南洋　成績極為圓滿</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕資源委員會爲配合國策，鼓勵出口，以爭取外匯起見，前曾飭所屬機構合灣糖業公司，揀選上等蔗糖輸出國外推銷。經洽商結果，前於上月十七日由太古洋行福州輪裝去特號砂白二百公噸，往爪哇新加坡兩地各一百噸試銷，每公噸售價五百美元，每磅計二角二分美元，成績圓滿。效悉新加坡又續訂一百公噸，該公司已託原輪於本月十九日由基隆裝出直駛該地。據悉：南洋各地需要食糖孔股，按首次台糖運去時，對其質地包裝重量均表歡迎，認爲與戰前爪哇所產佳品無異，且戰時該地遭受兵　，蔗田工廠破壞甚重，一時尚未恢復，台糖轍入，認爲五年來罕有貨品。台糖公司爲維持國際市塲計，以輸出精品爲原則，如棉白等均在摒棄之類，並爲鼓勵推銷起見，出口商有意經營者，亦在歡迎之列，並擬於年底新產品上市後，準備大量傾銷云</p>
<h3>中信局收購陳茶　茶商請提高收價</h3>
<p>擬推派代表四人晉京請願</p>
<p>關於由中信局收購去歲七萬箱陳茶事，該局前已核定爲祁門每担量高收購價爲七十二萬元，惟茶商方面再向主管當局，要求提高收價未果，已於日前呈文行政院等有關部院，臚陳困難，請求覆核。</p>
<p>茶商所要求者，爲按照中信局核定價格，增加百分之五十，因近日茶市向榮，各級茶葉皆上漲二三成不等，故實際上雙方相差價格約爲三成。華茶輸出業定週初召開大會，擬推代表四人晉京請願云。</p>
<h3>京滬隴海兩路撥車　載運西北棉花</h3>
<p>中紡公司爲解決本市棉荒，頃決向西北產棉區域採購大量棉花，以應急需。該公司業經呈准交通部，飭由京滬隴海兩路撥發貨車五百噸，專供裝運棉花之用。該項專車業於日前由滬首途駛往西北。據中紡公司負責人稱，首批西北棉花，將於半月後運抵本市，以後該項專車每月可往返兩次，按月可有棉花一千噸，經常供應本市紡織業云。</p>
<h3>協助交通公用等事業　交通銀行工作情形　卅五年度曾貸出大量款項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通銀行主要專業業務按規定係以協助交通公用及工礦生產事業之恢復與拓展爲主。茲探誌該行三十五年度辦理該項專業業務之詳情如次：</p>
<p>協助交通事業</p>
<p>以往在抗戰期間，後方交通情形較爲落後，協助之對象，亦屬較少。勝利以後，收復區內各大鐵路，及江海各綫輪航，以及空航，莫不返待積極恢復。本行使命所在，均竭力予以貸助。以言鐵路，則有津浦，平漢，粵漢，隴海，湘桂黔，北寗，中長等路。全國之主要幹綫，幾全包括在內，全年貸款總額達二百數十億元。公路方面，除協助交通部公路總局修復各路外，民營長途汽車公司購置汽車，恢復各路客貨運輸，亦爲本行致力之目標。全年貸款總額，亦達一百餘億元。輪船方面，如協助航商購買輪船，打撈沉船，以及臨時貸放航商流動資金，促進航業之迅速恢復，總額達一百四十餘億元。至航空事業對象不多，貸款較少，以中央航空公司之十一億元爲大數。</p>
<p>協助公用事業</p>
<p>關於公用事業，我國現狀自以電力事業爲首要。蓋電力爲一切工業之母，民生所賴。一年來貸給流動資金，及協助擴充購置機件等等，包括上海，南京，重慶，漢口，南昌，濟南，湖州，紹興，蘭谿，溫州，武昌，鎭江，蚌埠，蕪湖，宜昌，成都等各大都市之電氣事業，總額計七十餘億元。又協助上海，南京，重慶，成都等地自來水事業，購買機器材料等貸款約二十餘億元。此外如市內交通，及下水道碼頭輪渡等，本行協助其購置汽車機器等，總額亦達九十餘億元。</p>
<p>扶植工礦生產</p>
<p>對於工礦生產事業之扶植，則以直接與民生雄設有關之紡織染工業，食用工業，化學工業，礦業等四項爲主要對象，紡織染工業包括棉花絲三項，食用工業以麵粉業為主，化工業以基本化學工業及化學用品業爲主，礦業以煤礦業爲主。尤以紡織染工業一項，爲我國目前工業中較具歷史及規模，故貸款數字，亦較鉅大，總額達七百餘億元。爲適應社會經濟實况，斟酌需要之緩急，其中貸款數字，以棉紡業爲最多，絲織業次之，毛織業又次之。全國各大小城市，由十數萬錠之紗廠，以迄一般有關人民生計之手工業，凡合乎貸款條件者，莫不儘力予以協助</p>
<p>同時對於絲繭綢織方面，並經多方予以扶植。如蘇浙皖三省春繭貸款，以協助收繭工作，扶植繭農，增加生產，曁上海絲織業及杭市絲織工業及綢商業貸款等本行悉經參加，或主特辦理。食用工業方面，貸款總額達二百數十億元，大都爲麵粉工業。除原料成品押放外，在麥季期間，並以墊款方式，協助赴　地採購原料，以期資金確實用於購料生豫之述。再次爲化工業，總額達一百餘億元，以化工業在我國工業部門中，尚未普過沒達。本行除對較大之化工業，儘量協助外，即一般小廠及其他化學日用品之製造，亦均加以扶植。</p>
<p>其他工業方面，如水泥，煉油，製革，橡膠，汽車配件，建築材料等業，亦均加貸助。至礦業貸款，則達二百數十億元。全國產煤區域如山東，河南，河北，湖南，四川等省，以及較大之煤礦，如中興，開灤，淮南，河南民生，四川天府等，均有往來。東北地區，亦陸續展開協助復興建設促進生產力量之貸放業務。　綜計全年貸放於交通工礦及公用事業之貸款餘額，截止年底止，計共一千五百零九億餘元，佔放款總額百分之七十二，具徵本行對於扶助交通公用及工礦生產事業，蓋已不遺餘力，而亦勉符專業使命也。</p>
<p>至其他業務，則爲（一）協助疏暢物資；（二）辦理政府交辦特種業務；（三）疏通國內外匯兌業務；（四）代辦管理外匯；。分支機構之調整，（六）儲蓄業務；（七）推進信託業務</p>
<p>協助疏暢物資</p>
<p>本年度本行為配合政府疏通物資，平抑物價政策，經遵照四聯總處所訂押匯原則，積極推進國內埠際押匯業務，對於採購各地土產進口，及運銷土產出口之廠商，儘量承做進出口押匯。其在打包期間，有需融通資金者，亦酌予貸助。本年產棉季節，爲協助各廠商赴產區收購棉花，並經辦理購棉押匯。至對於出口商在內地搜購物資，運銷國外，倘需資金融通者，經參照規定，凡向本行辦理結匯之出口物資，均予以貸助。截至本年底止，辦理埠際押匯計一千二百餘億元，購棉押匯二百餘億元，出口國外物資押匯押放三百餘億元。惟以國內交通未臻暢達，仍嫌收效未宏，是猶待於各方之共同努力也。</p>
<p>政府交辦業務</p>
<p>勝利之初，後方物價暴落，駸致工業不獲維持成本，相繼停工，政府急謀救濟，指定本行會同中國，中農，中信等行局，塲辦後方緊急工貸。本年度承接上年成案，對於尚未獲得此項貸助之工廠，繼續辦理，後方工業賴以勉渡難關。截至上年底止，本行承貸部份，計十一餘億元，本年先後貸出五千二百餘萬元。同時又承辦收復區複工貸款，協助收復區工礦之復業，本行貸出總額計五十九億餘元　又財政部爲協助華僑復業起見，訂定華僑復業貸款辦法，分由本行及中開銀行辦理貸款，基金則由中央中國曁本行分担。貸款區域共分五區。本行承辦菲列濱及緬甸兩區，’菲列濱區經本行委由菲列濱交通銀行，正與當地領事館洽辦中。緬甸區已由本行仰光支行，從事辦理。申請貸款之僑民，頗爲踴躍，已放出盧比約二百萬盾。</p>
<p>疏通內外匯兌</p>
<p>勝利以還，收復區分支機構，積極復業，匯兌業務日益擴展。關於國內匯兌方面，當復員初期。收復區資金端賴後方撥濟，但當時交通未暢，券運艱困，本行對於匯兌資金之調節，集中統籌於工商繁盛解款重要地點，並設置匯兌基金，謀其疏暢，一面藉進出口押匯，互爲調劑。本年七月，國行爲平抑滬市物價，管理各地申匯，木行配合進行，嚴限各地行處承做申匯。分配承匯數額，以工商正當需要爲準。俾在限制之中，仍寓疏暢之意。</p>
<p>綜計一年來各行處匯兌業務，較勝利前其總數計增一萬四千餘億元。至僑匯方面，本行於勝利之初，即經擬訂恢復海外僑匯辦法。印度方面。本行原有機構，仍繼續收匯。菲列濱方而，自經美軍收復後，即委由菲列濱交通銀行，經收越南及緬甸機構，亦經先後復業。</p>
<p>綜計所收僑匯，以匯往閩粵一帶爲大宗。經一面在僑眷集中區域，增設機構，一面儘量簡捷收解手續。本年三月開放外匯市塲，提高美匯匯率以後，僑匯顯見增加。惟嗣後終仍因匯價關係，僑匯逐見下降。雖八月間美匯匯率，再度提高，收匯數字，仍鮮起色。</p>
<p>至全年收做僑匯，合國幣共爲四十五億五千餘萬元，內菲列濱方面計三十八億七千餘萬元，印緬方面計六億七千餘萬元。</p>
<p>代辦管理外匯</p>
<p>本年三月政府公佈外匯及進出口貿易管理辦法，授權中央銀行暫行管理外匯任務，並規定指定銀行得經營外匯，本行爲指定銀行之一，以管理外匯中心，係在上海，因先由上海分行，依照管理外匯辦法，經營外匯交易。其後漢口，天津，廣州，汕頭，江門，梧州，靑島等地，相繼承辦。除購入外匯外，所有出售外匯，悉以合乎規定用途爲限。關於外幣存款，在管理外匯辦法實施時起，即依法停收。其既內各行處，截至九月卅日止，外幣存款幷已先後照餘額改結國幣，由本行分別以英美金轉售中央銀行。十一月進出口貿易暫行辦法重經修訂，對於輸入，須先申請輸入許可證。除上海方面對附表一三兩類貨物，價在二千美元以下者之申請，可由指定銀行辦理外。其餘輸入之申請，均須經輸入會之核准。同時辦理進口商登記結售外匯業務，一時暫形頓滯，至出口結匯一項，因匯價及國內外成本售價仍欠均衡，雖有承做，爲數不多（未完）</p>
<h3>五縣布廠業聯會　在蘇開三次會議</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿日電〕蘇虞錫澄武五縣布廠業聯誼會，今在蘇舉行第三次會議，到谷縣代表共廿六人，決定要案多項：（一）向紡調會申請增加配紗數量，幷規定按月配售二次。（二）向四聯總處申請生產貸款。（五）索請遞　油公司配售柴油，以維生產。（四）下屆會議定八日廿四日在武進舉行。</p>
<h3>錢業公會提議重估　準備財產價值</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市錢業公會，近以銀錢業聯合準備會對會員所繳存之準備財產，其估價業已歷久未行重估，致原定佔價，興目前市價，已相形過低，有提　重行調整估價之說云。</p>
<h3>漳州枝見新</h3>
<p>首批漳州新荔枝干，昨有小數運到，以成本較昂，而實銷觀望不前，價格恐未能過好。</p>
<h3>本年紗布產量　可達二百萬件</h3>
<p>外銷棉紗估計可達一百萬件</p>
<p>當局對我國外銷紗布，將以去年全國國營民營各紗廠紗布生產總額，供應國內需要，復以本年增產之數量輸出國外。</p>
<p>茲據某紡繼專家之佔計，如該訊屬實，則本年可供外銷之棉紗，　將大量增加，　以去年各支棉紗生產量計，國營　約四十六萬件，民營廠約六十萬件，生產總額不過一百萬件以上。</p>
<p>本年產量估計，國營廠約可產八十萬件，民營廠約可產一百二十萬件，生產總額估計可達二百萬件左右，則外銷棉紗，估計可　　萬件左右。</p>
<h3>木材市況</h3>
<p>杉木聞由閩運滬之貨甚夥，市氣由堅趨平，間亦有遠期拋售者，洋松市氣則疲。</p>
<h3>燒碱來源稀少　影響皂廠生產　該業亟盼政府積極協助</h3>
<p>我國肥皂工業所需用之重要原料燒碱，向購自英美等國，尤以向美國購買者爲最多，國產燒碱之供給，僅佔一小部份而已。</p>
<p>自輸管會限制外匯額以後，致外貨來源大減，製皂工業原料日益枯竭，影響生產。有關當局曾竭力予該業以優先酣給燒碱，仍感杯水車薪，難濟於事。查該業四十家工廠，照目下生產情况計算，每月最少需用燒碱七十餘萬公斤。</p>
<p>茲悉：卅六年上半年度，該業配得之燒碱原料，計三月份由永利化學工廠配給永利燒碱五十桶（每桶三百公斤），每桶價四百八十萬元。四月份配給永利純碱三百包（每包八十公斤），每包十五萬元。五月份永利燒碱五十桶，每桶六百四十萬元，永利純碱四百包，每包四十萬元。六月份由經濟部上海工商輔導處，配給台灣燈塔牌燒碱九十七桶，每桶五百六十萬元。上列配給原料，均由該業公會按照生產比例分配與全體會員，惟以當時配售價格，並不較市價低廉，故亦有會員自動放棄。規模較大之各廠，爲欲顧全將來之配給權利計，乃予以全數購買。</p>
<p>據該業中人談稱：似此配給情形，對該業實無積極之補助，肥皂爲民生日用之必需品，爲重要工業之一，故亟盼政府及各主管機關，予以有力之協助，期使我國肥皂工業前途得以發展云。</p>
<h3>蠶絲產銷協導推派代表　參加萬國生絲公會</h3>

<h3>上海之三夾板工業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查上海三夾板工業概况，詳情有如後述：</p>
<p>一，概述：本市三夾板製造廠，計有祥泰，義成，鳳鳳，精藝，上海，啓明，揚子等七家。祥泰與養成，於民國十六七年間先後成立。（當時祥泰爲英商，中國木料進出口公司所辦）。是爲滬市有三夾板製造工業之開端。最初二三年，出品僅爲我國出口茶葉裝箱之用，故其時設備亦較小型。自後因業務發展，三夾板之用途擴展，傢俱營造兩業採用，故擴充設備製迭３×６以上之大張三夾板。且鳳凰精藝上海啓明揚子等廠，相繼成立。珍珠港事變後，各廠爲環境所迫，先後停業，僅日人所辦之啓明揚子二廠，繼讀製造。勝利後，各廠積極恢復，現七廠均在開工之中。</p>
<p>二，設備：各廠廠址，爲主要原料筒木運入方便起見，十九有水路可通黃浦江。其主要設備，爲刨片機，裁切機，烘乾機，上膠機，冷壓機，熟壓機，烘乾室，橫直切邊機，刨光機，砂光機等。七家中以祥泰設備最全，佈置適宜，產量較大。各廠現有設備，均不能盡量利用，原料缺乏故也。茲將七廠各機設備數量，及開用數，分列如后：刨光機七部六部砂光機一部一部</p>
<p>三，產品：三夾板，五夾板，七夾板等各種夾板，惟以３×６三夾板產量最大，因市面需要最巨</p>
<p>四，產量：產量方面，照各廠設備配合情况，其最大生產量，現時產量列表如后：（以３×６三夾板爲計算標準）。</p>
<p>五，原料：製造三夾板工業之主要原料，爲柳安，酪精粉，燒，碱，泡化碱，及貨豆粉等。</p>
<p>六，結端：目前國內三夾板工業，在建築，傢俱，裝飾等業上，均已佔重要地位，現時月產約十萬張，不敷市面所需，爲增加生產，該業所需之原料，以柳安，酪精粉，燒碱等，在國產品方面，（柳安雖可以本松代替，惟出量不敷），不能大量供應，以前爲維特該業生產，暫時准予進口，在所不免。</p>
<p>查木料爲三夾板製造中最重要之原料，佔全部原斜價格總數五分之四，以國內日產本材，亟應早日籌劃，能全部自行供應，不再仰給外來，對伐林機械設備，交通運輸之改進，藉以增加出產數量，及培造森林，以便永久供應不斷，實屬迫切之需。</p>
<h3>受百物飛漲影響　夏委呢絨節節高翔</h3>
<p>孟夏月半後，細毛織成之呢羢嗶嘰，受火票發行，及百物飛騰影響，零躉行情，無不躍張。呢羢商號俱以廠商之馬首是瞻，於市價上漲時期，反而競相購買。若麥爾登實銷已多落令，其價竟亦升漲不少，上海游資充斥，可覘一斑。實銷方面中西裝衣料，本客帮均不弱，高檔來路呢羢，則遠較下檔貨爲暢活。</p>
<p>仲夏呢羢市價，賡續上漲，業中人之目光，預測後市勢必再高，實因定貨困難，廠商生產價昂而絡續减少，單靠香港轉口及走私貨之運滬，究屬杯水車薪，無濟於事。同時米價超越四十萬元以上一担，百物貨價復又直綫上騰，亦爲一大原因。</p>
<p>季夏呢羢依然級級晉漲，中句後更形劇烈，除派立司凡立丁諸夏貨，受時令銷路關係略疲外，悉多全部上騰。良以交通公用事業猛漲在先，百物紛紛跟踪，米價漲至五十萬元，絲紗綢布烟皂小菜各種物價，接連躍跳，呢羢亦何能例外也。而香港運申價昂貨跌，亦一原因。西服做工受生活指數解凍影響，每套來料做工均已水漲船高，喊做一百二十萬以至二百萬元。章華花呢現市每碼售三十五六萬元，廠盤定價則須四十萬元，收定洋七成。</p>
<p>茲將夏令孟仲季三月呢羢標準市價，查刋數種於后，以備參考：以下均係每碼批發行情，元爲單位。</p>

<h3>魏道明出巡　隨行記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員暮雲</p>
<p>台北十七日航訊</p>
<p>縱斷五百公里西台灣</p>
<p>從七月十二日至十七日間，記者隨魏主席·朱佛定　長·鈕先銘參謀長等出巡，在西部台灣十一個大小縣市裏，作五百公里的旅行。</p>
<p>台島現在正是最熱的季節，北回歸綫嘉義以後，就無法抹去直淋的汗珠。沿織路綫的風物原是記者所熟習的，我們呼吸着第一期稻作割去後，新翻的泥土氣息，水牛給戴笠的老　趕着犁田；簾園是靜靜的一片，沿途有隨手可擷的芒果·龍眼·　……原野眞襯着高元的烟由，低矮的紅色的田舍，台灣正像江南一般的可愛，也正和南國一樣，値得愛戀！</p>
<p>當魏主席一行，在收復的祖國的大地。親歷自已所管理的長富庶的地帶，接觸淳良的，進步的人民，該有着異樣興奮的心情吧！</p>
<p>黑影·天花·細菌</p>
<p>二·二八到現在還存留着深深的黑影，這黑影實是極不幸的創痕，台胞們，迄未忘記它所帶來的災映，他們現在只有一個希望，從寬處理，趕快結東！這是在一個大前提之下：主犯要明正典刑，從犯和嫌疑者從速釋放！</p>
<p>魏主席樂觀地說這只是一個誤會，誤會是可以取得瞭解而獲冰釋的。因爲他深信台肺是道地的中國人，有着中華民族的血統·風俗·習慣無不相同，省內外人都是同胞，他例舉抗戰初期川渝地區的情形來說明感情上的破裂結果只有促使更爲親愛。一年半來，台胞對國語已有大大的進步，他們能以國語談話，若干更能作短短的演講，魏主席也願於一年後能以台語表白他的政見，突破語言的隔膜。</p>
<p>二·二八畢竟是慘痛的，到如今眞實的內幕還未見表露，各階層的工作人員仍像失了彈性似的不够勁兒：若干人却誤以爲是海島的「五四運動」，甚至一種「革命運動」。但不論如何，對新的省府却是最好的敎訓，它以血·淚·生之怒火，指示了施政的路標，希望這個然影能立即消失，創痕能迅速彌補。有心人說：二二八許是天花吧，不可能成爲細菌。　在高雄·鳳山，記者看到穿着長衫背心白髮龍鍾的老者。五十年外族的刧持，消滅不了古中國的面影，只有更加强愛國的向心力。台灣同胞決不會否認，他原是十分之十的中國人！</p>
<p>台中霧峯訪林獻堂</p>
<p>魏主席所過之地，都是被民衆·參議員·屬下，以及山地同胞拜謁，訪問和一覩丰彩的對象，例外的是遄訪省府委員林獻堂，那是十三日上午，霧峯林宅。</p>
<p>林寓是一所刻劃着舊時代紅綠相映宮殿式的院落，它和板橋的林本源花園有着同一的情調：古色古香，林氏白髮禿頂，精神飽滿，是一個擁有一五〇入三代同堂的長者，他是一千甲（每甲合十五畝）以上大地主階級的代表者。</p>
<p>在二·二八時，林獻堂做了財政廳長嚴家淦的保護人，他不但沒有參加事變，而且還直接帮助了外省人。其堅定的表現，到白部長蒞台時得了成功！實際上，他是六百三十萬人中的權威，處於領導地位的紳士，他可以而且必要地犧牲小我完成大我。但者最近以公定價格，收購餘糧的諭爭上，他却站在純地主的利益上摒絕糧食局理論和實際上的數字，堅持提高價格。結果終因敵不過大多數人民的反對，以一公斤二七·五元價格通過；林氏是被慘敗了！</p>
<p>霧峯有過光榮的歷史，昔年梁啓超曾作訪問，大廳上還掛着段祺瑞的題字，使人們像投入蘇州的一個世家。當我們離開這個小鎭時，心裏浮沉着這樣一個問題：「假使台省實行民選，省主席候澤人是林獻堂不是？」</p>
<p>重割行政區域糾紛</p>
<p>在雀府會議上，林獻堂曾作改正地方行政區域的建議。主要的是（一）縮小縣區，公事往復，簡提便利，（二）民選較易，（三）區署可以撇消；即是目前全省八縣九市，改爲二十二佩縣！　這只是一個建議，省府對這個率涉太廣的行政改區，是需要從長考慮的。就祗是這個建議，却就得甚大的反響，多數人一致主張不合理的小縣制度，在進步的國家早經廢止的，目前不再能適用。不過因爲光復時間太快，當局未能從長計議，結果發生了若干不合理現象；目前即令馬上修正，也非易事了！</p>
<p>合中參議員洪元煌說：重劃行政區和確定縣市地址，都不能僅憑個人的主觀而決定的，他激昂地說：爲什麼台中市具有優越的環境而不設縣治，却讓一二〇萬人民的政府擁到偏僻低窪沒有設備的員林來了赴公務員早晚奔跑？原有的建築荒廢？</p>
<p>霪雨月餘釀成災害</p>
<p>台灣是個多災的區域，颱風·雨·地震·急流·砂質·自然的厄難，給予建設上的損害最大。一個多月的豪雨，在南部釀成了災害。長四六公尺的大肚溪橋，冲毀了的鋼鐵架子，還在吮着混濁的溪流。烏溪頭邊，到現在還張着殘缺的大口，台中縣遭遇二十年來未有的水災，有四十多處堤防潰決，田舍爲墟，晨民呼喊着救濟，搶修，宮民合作下的大安，大甲溪水災緊急搶修費二百萬，工程費需一千二百萬元。可是修復，和補修，全部却需十一億元，這是鉅大的數字。</p>
<p>台南，高雄各地都遭受了極大的災害，這情形雖不如黃河的大決口，但合灣民衆在這樣的塲合，常以此來測騐政府關心民瘼與否的。</p>
<p>台灣的農田，十分之七是靠人爲的水利工程，嘉南大圳是代表作，魏主席對這大圳的工程是贊賞的。不過日本人建設了水利，供給農民增產，把利益仍舊送還日本人，今天的政府是儘可能帮助建設，而將利益分配給大衆。　建設是困難的，但維持和保護更是困難。全省的治水費年需二億至三十億。台灣的建設，和搶修却需要同時並進。</p>
<p>地方建設的積極性</p>
<p>台胞對地方建設關切的積極性，是內地人民所不及的。他們只怕沒機會，有機會時決不放棄發言權，決不忘記地方，決不捨棄自我的利益。新竹縣境儘多是看天田，他們特別希望水利建設，七萬五千市民的新竹市，因為竹東擁有大量的天然資源，憧憬，着工業都市的從速發展，台中市需要在文化都市的建設以外完成，安平漁港；嘉義市吶喊着完成「陸港。」</p>
<p>在農產豐足的縣份，都期望向盟軍要求的賠償工廠，能遷設各該地區，他們更急迫地要求肥料廠，要求抵利貸款從事復興建設，要求配售水泥和木材，供給眞正需要者，要求改善農民生活。</p>
<p>特別是嘉義台南和高雄，戰爭的火藥氣，在頽敗廢圯上仍留着强烈的味兒，它還是光復初期破爛的景象，在目前這個處境裘，似乎只讓人們回憶過去未來的遠景，只作如夢的熱烈的懷想！</p>
<p>一個方向·一條路綫</p>
<p>台胞對經濟上的要求，更多於政治，省府現在採取這一方式：安定經濟，安定社會，在安定經濟以後，再求得社會的安定。台幣提高了，若干特產製成品的價格降低或漲高了，在經濟安定物價不受波動以後來求改進，求建設！這是一個前進的方向，一個路綫。</p>
<p>魏主席以輕鬆銳利的語調，警告省胞不要迷信日本，不要漢視現實。他說：「以前的世界，以前的中國，以前的台灣，假令我們來接收了，合胞的生活一定比以前的當時更好；要是現在這世界，這中國，這台灣，仍給日本人侵佔，合胞們的生活將更爲痛苦，更沒自由。正因爲我們面臨着這非常的困厄的處境，決不能使我們關起大門來，漠視世界情勞。」</p>
<p>在經濟政策上，新的省府似乎抉擇了有限制的自由主義。綱領要政府建立，合作，支持需要民衆，民衆更需要表現力量，這是民主！</p>
<p>歡迎企業家來投資</p>
<p>台灣問題，魏主席認爲旣單純，又樂觀！</p>
<p>台灣敎育，建設，農，工業都有基礎，這個基礎遭頗爭的破壞，到目前尚未見復原。魏主席面允各縣市民衆，從速修復國民學校，設法救濟失業。以他冒暑深入民間的接觸，環繞於多數台胞間的問題，已獲得淸晰的輪廓，這是堪爲施政的絕好根據和參考，過往政府和民衆間的距離被縮短了！</p>
<p>台灣有一個較安定的環境，有較內地優越低廉的動力·勞動力，有若干特產品，原料，供應工業的需要，有靈活運輸工具有和港口。省府用雙手謝絕一切投機商，同時却帶笑歡迎大規模企業的投資！</p>
<p>合灣已有了一個新的起點，這新的起點將以民主自發表現的力量，實事求事的粉粹一切侵略者，野心家的謠傳和妄想！</p>
<p>目前，台灣同胞更理智了，但他們仍急切需要溫飽，需要建立善良正常的社會風氣，需要各方面緊密地配合起來，解決他們所要解決的切身問題，他們把希望寄託在成立兩個月的新省府！（暮雲攝）（暮雲攝）（暮雲攝）</p>
<h3>劉伯誠在隴海綫　濁黃河已濁之水　苦魯西已苦之民</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　范世勤</p>
<p>鄭州十三日航訊</p>
<p>說是黃河是一條橫貫整個國內成爲南北兩方面天然的防綫的話，那末南面是較北面尤爲堅强，因爲南面還有一條與河平行的的隴海綫，可以算是黃河第二道防綫，這一點，在抗戰史上已經有了事實的說明，不必再談。現在要說的是潼關以下，無論是黃河下游，或是隴海鐵路，爲什麼正像一個發怒的人的筋凸脈脹一樣的一回事。這個緊張狀態，與其說是即將來臨的黃河大汛所造成的，不如說共匪劉伯誠之類倡亂叛國所引起的。</p>
<p>雜牌儸儸奉旨出犯</p>
<p>劉伯誠攻安陽失敗後，馬上進行補充，嘴裏說是還要進犯安陽，心裏已經安排另一主張。恰巧聯總呼籲請求雙方在黃河下游停止軍事行動，於是就在濮縣一帶渡過黃河南岸來，陷郵城，佔鄆城，犯菏澤，攻定陶，竄鉅野：其不但濁黃河已濁之水，且苦魯西已苦之民。當然，其下的隴海東段就進入緊張狀態。　豫北是劉匪擾亂的地區，這次他出犯魯西以後，他的一些雜牌儸儸們自然聽從他的意思，也是恐懼頭兒走了後有被消滅可能，所以仍是到處滋騷；劉伯誠當然知道他們沒有多大作用，因此他借重「新獨立第四旅」「獨立第五旅」之類的一些太行山共匪，做他的策應，要他們在豫北審他闊鬧塲。大槪有二萬餘太行山匪軍，就竄到博愛，沁陽，孟縣一帶來，於是這一段上黃河的水也起了無形的激盪，人爲的喘急了。</p>
<p>聽說，在同瀟兩側的陳賡共匪部隊，有四個旅已經移到晋陽；還聽說要在孟縣以西到垣曲一帶擺起一條沿河長蛇陣，也想把黃河的水淘成墨黑，以利於他的混水摸魚。</p>
<p>所以，從豫陝邊境沿河起一直到豫魯邊境止，大河與鐵路都是筋凸脈脹了。</p>
<p>妄圖建立新根據地</p>
<p>粗心的，或是單憑耳朶的，覺得共匪可眞了不起，要是看看山東方面陳毅的失敗，幾乎是要溜到烟台去渡河的情形，那末劉伯誠之所以在魯西方面出犯，以及陳賡所以要出來策應，還不是不得已之舉。劉伯誠尤其淸楚！今日陳毅之覆敗，即明日劉伯誠之毀滅；當然陳賡也是同劉伯誠一樣淸楚：明日劉伯誠之毁滅，即後日陳賡之滅亡。何以如此者？津浦綫通，陳毅絕；平漢綫通，劉伯誠終；同蒲路通，陳賡也隨之而完。所以他們非得把那致他們死命的直的戰綫拉到可以活命的橫的戰綫上來。</p>
<p>依劉伯誠這次宣傳，他這次預備到豫鄂邊區的大別山去建立根據地，陳賡預備也過河來後到陝鄂豫川邊境的秦嶺山裏去建立根據地。劉伯誠僅僅如此吹吹，像是過去所說在三星期內攻下安陽的話，給人家當笑柄，亦無不可；果眞他們要這樣做的話，除了當李先念的替死鬼外，還落得什麼呢？此說可以加註如下，此說虎人，虎借人之咸者之人；此說輸入，輸明其虛實者之人。</p>
<p>聰明手法擺韓信陣</p>
<p>這次劉伯誠不再攻安　而改攻魯西，不敢硬碰下去，是其聰明之處，因爲他在安陽方面玩的一套全被守軍李扳淸戳穿了，魯西的國軍有些還沒有同他對壘過，這一方面可以顯他的身手，一方面也可以使他的部下不再走氣下去。無論是成功不成功，擺的總是有名的韓信陣，所差的只是韓信的背水陣在渡口上沒有把着乓備着船，而劉伯誠背永陣旣有兵復有般在其渡口上而已。劉伯誠的背水陣有其長處，也有其短處，這點我們得下這樣一個小結論。劉伯誠在魯西作戰，還有得到一點便宜處，就汎區裏的共匪的金紹山，魏鳳樓部隊可以直接策應他，聽說他們已經在隴海東段以南局部集中了，其數目從寬佔計一萬左右。金紹山魏鳳樓在汎區之所以能够活動，是一向靠着三五百一二千分羣亂竄的關係，這次集中起來，固然可以策應劉伯誠，可是這麼一集中，正是給予國軍殲滅的機會！這點金紹山魏鳳樓的苦衷，是眼前劉伯誠所不能體認的最後要等事實會告訴他。</p>
<p>決戰發動　補給維艱</p>
<p>寫這篇通訊的時候，國軍恐怕已經在和劉伯誠集中荷澤鄆城定陶之間五六萬人發生決戰。這決戰的結果暫時留上空白，這並非沒有判斷把握，或是有關什麼軍事秘密，因爲那事情太淸楚，這次他在那一地區攻擊，是否願意在勝利中被黃河到來的大汎淹死呢？還是願意失敗了逃回到他老擾亂區的豫北去呢？跑在黃河的水前頭深入吧，己經在前面替他說明了，再要說得明白些，那只要問他補給在那裏就是了。</p>
<p>陳賡部隊僅供策應</p>
<p>孟縣一帶共匪，乃至陳賡部隊想要渡河擾亂的話，以少部隊渡河，必被消滅；以大部隊渡河，沒有這筆大本綫，有之，憑什麼把握？當初李先念的殘部請陳賡來接迎，始終沒有做到。劉伯誠在魯西一帶進進出出，摸慣了路，陳賡第一次要渡河渦來到豫西一帶，談何容易？伏牛山中的二三百殘匪，又抵不上像金紹山魏鳳樓在汎區的勢力可以策應他，就是搖旗吶喊也太遠了些。歸根一句話；陳賡這些部隊是只能作策應用的部隊，當然不能形成一個主戰的局面出來，其能够使這一帶黃河的水看起來像煞更激盪，更喘急，也可算達成其任務了。</p>
<p>當然這一條綫上，會有一相當時期的緊張的局面。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>光復一號稻種</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣十八日航訊</p>
<p>嘉義農業試騐支所，過去對本省農業上之研究改進，頗負聲譽。該所前鑒於粳稻（台灣稱蓬萊稻）受稻熱病爲害至鉅，數十年來各國學者埋頭研究，均未獲得結果，乃數度試騐，終於粳稻雜交系統中選出Ｋ１１０〇一系，確具有顯著的抵抗性，產量品質亦屬良好，較目下台灣栽植最普通的台中六十五號標準種產量高出四倍以上，此種空前成就，實爲今後稻作育種事業上開一新紀元，且亦爲我國在農業上之榮譽貢獻，台省主席魏道明本月十四日至嘉義巡視時，特命名爲「光復」號稻種」，尤具有深畏意義。（本報特派員江暮雲寄）</p>

<h3>樓居</h3>
<p>— 鄷廷和</p>
<p>慣於樓居的人，正如同慣於鄉居，有着一種自然的樂趣；而這種樂趣，殊有「不足爲外人道」意味，要慣的於樓居的人，纔能深切體會。如果你是一位樓居者，偶然間在地平綫上的房屋裏住上一兩日，當你閉目瞑想的時候，試一回味樓居，眞有人間天上飄飄然之感呢。</p>
<p>我愛樓居，當那月夕花辰，依偎着樓欄，聽蟲聲啷啷雀鳴啾啾，炊烟繚繞着襟袖，雲彩飛吻着面頰。於是想起那位登樓觸動文思而作賦的文學家王粲，雖然他的那種閉情，織巧綺麗得近乎兒女情態，但由於登樓這一事實而引起他的烟斯匹里純而作賦却是千眞萬確的呢。</p>
<p>北平居久了的人，每每喜歡談論北平所特有的市聲，然而，這種市聲要在樓居者聽來，纔能領悟其中的音調的藝術。我在北一平居住了不少的時間，在這些悠長的歲月中，恰好多在樓居生活中消磨。對於北平的市聲，在我聽覺上曾經三個演變的階段，初聽時，我煩　，認爲是一種都市的哨子，牠發出許多不同的音調，給與市民多種多樣的召喚；稍緩，我對於這些市聲，聽來覺得還很順耳，某一個音響能够表達某一個意義；後來，這些市聲，當我在樓居時聽習慣了以後，却感到非常的親切，像許多的樂譜上的昔符，夜夜奏出文化古城的繁複變化的夜曲；我住的寓所，正在一段鬧中靜的街頭，推開樓窗，依攔凝眸，能够很淸晰的看到那些市聲的播弄者，於斯我開始驚訝這古城的偉大，同時我又咀嚼這樓居生活是如此這般的富於高雅的意趣呢。</p>
<p>在武漢三鎭的旅行，是我年來生活歷程上，難以忘懷的記憶。在這些記憶中，我應該敍述登臨黃鶴樓的觀感。談起黃鶴樓，這歷史上聞名的勝地，古今來最富有政治意義一座樓。當我摳衣登臨的時會，眞不勝感慨萬千，撩起我那多年藴藏着的懷古的幽思，想像當時的英雄們在怎樣地利用大自然而舒展他們的奧略。黃鶴樓極得形勢的優勝，給予登臨者一種雄渾瑰奇的深刻印象。當我摳衣登樓，憑攔四顯，頗有臨風飛去的感覺。</p>
<p>記憶中還便我記起一種舊式廻欄曲折的走馬樓的情狀，那是在我家鄉一位姻戚家中，他們的祖先給他留下一所那樣饒富意趣的樓閣。樓面佔地盤甚廣，構造的形勢，至其匠心，前後貫穿，左右連繫，寬闊處像大庭，展延處像走廊，那種境界是別有天地的。恰恰又是依山傍水，花木扶疏，更增添這種樓閣的壯觀，我曾經在那兒消磨過一個暑季，在那時我是正在作一種詩詞的整理工作，整日價心目中縈繞着綺麗纏綿的情調和辭藻，配合着左右詩情盡意的環境，現在想起來猶似咀嚼橄欖樣的回味呢。</p>
<p>湖上風光，有許多的人都喜歡談起，我也想在這裏來談一談，我的故鄉是五湖之一的鄱陽湖　，家居湖濱一所水鄉，堤岸逶迤，柳枝婀娜。我家是一座永榭式的層樓，推窗外望，便可飽覽湖上綺妮風光。由於與水接近，當湖水泛漲的季節，湖水與我居的樓頭接近，於斯我便在樓頭埀釣，輕捷地約取各色各樣的游魚。有時魚鈎會牽動樓沿的柳梢，驚起黃鸝，向遠遠的大外飛鳴而去。</p>
<p>樓居湖上，自然而然的會習慣許多水上生活，陶醉於水上情調。戚友們常常會放掉湖中，採摘盈筐滿籃的菱角送來樓頭，給你一頓豐盛的淸新的飽餐。最是纏綿，則莫過於夜坐樓頭，聆船孃嬌滴滴地唱着水上艷歌，更給水上樓居的生活增添不少羅曼蒂克的意味。</p>
<p>戰時，我還有一個時期，在山鄉度過敎書生活，校舍是借用着廟宇，而我恰又居住在廟宇附近的樓上，山寺蕭森，叢林寂寞，霧擁巉岩，讓封瀑布。山僧淸靜的生活，給人以世外人生的感覺，閑來偶與山僧樓頭共話，聆那種談狐說鬼，話佛講經的腔調，又怪異又新奇，幻如置身聊齋說部中所描述的境界。在我多種樓居生活意趣中，山寺樓居又是值得叙述的充溢着素樸俊逸之趣。</p>

<p>王昌齡　池詩：「開門望長川，薄莫見漁者，借問白頭翁，垂綸幾年也？」孟襄陽詩：「所居最幽絕，所住皆靜者，依止此山門，誰能效某也？」二韻均用助語，瀟洒殊有致。褚朝陽詠五絲詩：「水底深休也，日中還賀之。」高幣侍眞定詩：「光華揚盛矣，霄漢在茲乎！」韓少師特國詩：『用舍時焉耳，窮通命也歟」—則以助語入律對矣。</p>
<h3>夜讀</h3>
<p>— 李貽調</p>
<p>小時候，偶然讀到「讀書樂」的一篇古體詩，對於其中「讀者之樂樂陶陶，夜深人家窗戶靜，滿庭明月霜天高」的幾句，頗有點感動；這顧然描寫的是秋夜讀書的情景。雖然當時自己還沒有多少夜讀的經騐，但已經微微地感到必如此才不失爲讀書的佳境。</p>
<p>戰前戰後十幾年的學校生活，機械而繁亂。雖然每晚自修的時間，都要就燈展卷，孜孜不息。但因爲入多聲雜，從沒有領略過夜讀的佳極。三十二年秋季，求學的生活告一段落，我開始到淮北的一個小城去工作。我們的機關在城裏最僻靜的一條小街上，而我住的又是最幽靜的一座小樓，樓外臨街，內向却是一個方形的小院，院中兩個花壇雖已半頽，但石榴以及其他的花草，還很蒼秀。這樣的環境，我一見便覺得頗適於讀書。幾天過後，生活已大致安定，白天事情並不多，晚上當然更不乏餘暇，而小樓淸絕無塵，架上的圖書已開始向我招手。又過幾日，恰逢一個月明之夜，淸輝下我倚樓閒眺，院中花影在牆，蕭疏如畫；樓外空街冷寂，犬吠時聞。這時，我的激動的心潮也就因着幽靜的環境而漸漸平靜；便開始打開書篋，揀出一本「劍南詩鈔」，就月下一朗朗吟誦。輕鬆的心境，頓覺得這良宵已爲我所有，月色花影，一切都是爲我而設。從此，我開始領略到了夜讀的眞趣。</p>
<p>這以後，每逢良夜，便不忘讀書。但讀的總以詩集或宋明小品爲多。因爲我覺得只有這些東西才適於眼前的環境；如果展開經史，便覺格格不入。漸漸地，我又感到徒讀不足以酬此良夜，於是興之所至，又開始臨窗舖紙，寫一點小品或雜感之類。在這樣壞境下產生出來的東西，有時還不乏靈感之作。不斷地寫，也不斷地寄出去，由秋而冬，發表的總計有數十篇之多。當時寫作之勤，現在想想，連自己也感到驚異。</p>
<p>前年的冬天，我回家匆匆地辦完了婚事，妻是我小時的同學，亂離中各自東西，已是十年不見。婚後一週，我又離鄉西上。此後因爲工作增劇，不但做文章已無餘暇；就連夜讀，也漸漸感到沒有那一份平靜的心情了。只有每次歸家，在夜深人靜之後，却常和妻挑燈共讀。窗外凉月一庭，花影浮動，萬籟俱寂，微聞吟哦，此情此景，如詩如畫。</p>
<p>北歸後人事紹繁，心緒益不寗靜，有時寫兩篇小文，已是忙裏偸閒；夜讀的佳趣，早已渺不可尋了。淸夜溯洄，不禁爽然。</p>
<h3>鄉居小品</h3>
<p>— 徐銘懷</p>
<p>夕陽</p>
<p>晚風的翅勝開始輕拂着湛靜的心扉。</p>
<p>夕陽是張滿殷紅色布帆的船，擱淺在山腰，吃力的掙扎，嬌喘，羞澀……像年靑少女浴後的一剎那。她吹彈得破的紅臉頰，迷幻地投下最後矞麗的微笑，倦怠的微笑。</p>
<p>夕陽是美好的，嫵媚的纖手溫撫着瘦黃牛底背，收童吹起輕淸的口哨，縷樓音波嫋入晚風，柴肩數挑，悠徐地越過小橋，邨前，蓊鬱的榛樹林，颯颯地落下昏鴉。窈渺，迷濛，烘托成整個幽靜恬適的梵高筆下的畫面，情調凄淸而寫遠，意境爽朗而哀愁……</p>
<p>夕陽是一首幽美的小詩呵。</p>
<p>夕陽底詩，抹在淡藍的穹蒼上，灑在淡藍的湖面上，像寫在詩人的淡藍的心版之上呵，是寫在心版上的一首抒情詩呵。霞多伯里在「追憶」裏寫着：</p>
<p>你記得嗎恬靜的湖面，</p>
<p>擦過輕靈的燕子，</p>
<p>搖曳的蘆葦爲風掛牽，</p>
<p>還有水上的夕陽，這樣美</p>
<p>讀着它，我想念遠方的友人，讀着它，我懷起病來了，懷起憂挹的病來了，讀着它，我感念起生的歏息，生的索寞，永恒的索寞，永恒的歏息……。</p>
<p>夜</p>
<p>瞑色朦朧的烏雲悄然落下，　愴地，沉鬱地吻着原野。</p>
<p>夜沉睡着，像熱病的死人。荒漠，空虛，沒遮攔地瀰漫着；大地盡頭，有人在寂寞地訴說着夜的故事：</p>
<p>棗樹林裏，黃昏，誰又遺下了脆嫩的靈魂，嬌小的生命在破布裏掙扎。野狗走近，露出饕餮的紳士式的獰笑，死勁地爭吵，狂吠，撕裂着黝黑的命運，不知是慶幸，是讚禮？</p>
<p>更議悽冷的嫋入夜霧。</p>
<p>哭聲浸透矮樓，多情的寡婦在夢後，惺忪地，顫巍巍地　語，噙着淚珠，無聲的歏息，無聲的啜泣，是愛，是悔，是恨。</p>
<p>木魚響出雋永的旋律，伴着修道女虔誠的溫婉的嚅囁。</p>
<p>油燈爆出喜躍的火花，照亮未褪色的靑春：酡紅的臉，股紅的唇，白晳的肌膚，豐滿的曲綫跟玫瑰似的笑。</p>
<p>牆頭跳下幾個大黑影，都閃着綠色，淫佚，貧婪的眼睛，粗黑的大毛手拉破堅牢的靑土布褲，獸性像炸彈般爆裂，持續的爆裂着。</p>
<p>黑影在牆頭消失，留下浪濤樣滿足卑鄙的在笑，纖弱的痛苦的呻吟，油燈失望的凝視着這幕悲劇的演出和終塲。</p>
<p>燐火，幽靈底眼睛，蠱惑地眨着慘綠的光，骷髏招着手的漆黑的墳塚，有人，垂着頭，拖着手杖，穿過蔓草。灰暗的眼睛低沉，那樣安閒，寗靜，宛如去赴一塲華宴。</p>
<p>檢樹在周遭發響，樹影的手按着黑鍵盤，喪歌在墓地奏起。</p>
<p>瘦頸落在繫住榆樹枝的褲帶上，脚底離地。他微笑着，尋到了最後的安慰。「死是睡眼底兄弟」？是的。</p>
<p>你聽，有人向大地，在它盡頭，寂寞地，不息地訴說着夜的故事；夜色幽黑，像熱病的死人。烏雲歷得更重了，寒愴地，沉鬱地吻着原野——</p>
<h3>夏·在山村</h3>
<p>— 陳矛</p>
<p>山坡</p>
<p>山坡懶懶的續着，在夏日的夕陽下。</p>
<p>草，繁茂而且頎長，叢叢而且密密地，倔强的生長着。蔓生的葛藤糾纏着它們，爬過它們的頭，又爬上了一株小栗樹。</p>
<p>一隻蟬在小栗樹上朗朗的吟着，另外，在不遠的樹業間，別一隻蟬應和了起來：「吱——啦——」</p>
<p>雲，悠悠而緩緩的在天之下移動着。</p>
<p>四周是靜靜的，靜靜的；　連綿羊也只默默地啃着草，一個孩子可在樹蔭下睡着了。</p>
<p>溪流</p>
<p>溪流流在樹蔭下，溪水綠得似乎是黑色了。</p>
<p>一條小魚從樹根下溜了出來，愉快地玩着，但，一見到葉縫中偸進來的太陽光，它又潑刺一聲，吃驚地溜了回去。</p>
<p>在上游，一個山村的女孩子靜靜而緊張地蹲伏在石階上，她在伺候一隻蟹。</p>
<p>更上游，孩子們在撲着水胡鬧着，嬉笑的聲音應和着溪水下游村婦的槌衣聲，於是，一隻機警的蝦子霍的縮進了石縫。</p>
<p>近傍的山村裏，母鷄在略略地告訴着她又生了一個蛋。</p>
<p>茅店</p>
<p>在孤寂的山野裏，茅店對旅人和勞働者是比王宮還可貴。</p>
<p>茅店依傍着古老的山道，在一個山崗或坡嶺的脚下，寂寞地部住了腳。</p>
<p>茅店前面有着凉棚；村婦坐在凉棚裏，爲她的孩子，做着一點活計。凉棚裏放着茶缸，放着桌子，還放着許多蔭凉。</p>
<p>壯健而粗獷的勞働者，孤獨而憂鬱的旅行人；在凉棚裘，會成了朋友，會互相感嘆着生活，互相安慰着遭遇……。在人類稀少的地方，親愛就變得自然，眞誠和坦率了。</p>
<p>傍晚，淸冷的凉棚就變成了茅店中寂寞的孩子的樂園，他們會爬在桌子上，以孤寂的心情凝視着山嵐崗嶺，口中會哼着一些山歌。</p>
<p>而茅屋上，也昇起了裊裊的炊烟。</p>
<p>當太陽疲乏地落入山腰而遙遠的古剎裏響起了悠悠的晚鐘的時候，暮靄，牠就老實不客氣的掩蓋了山野，……</p>
<p>於是，黃昏星，就是樹梢上出現了……</p>

<p>— 季康</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　351</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>再說耀羣，她的唯一秘訣就是「熬困」。只要有事，她就可以硬熬，熬到五六十小時，可以不霎眼睛。她的哲學，也很特別：她說「咱們幹事，應有老癮打麻將的精神；哪怕三天三宿，應當越打越有精神」。她這一型，完全靠在集中精神，維持任事的興趣；興趣可以驅遂睡魔。好在她是一位康健的少女，心無旁鶩，只知道「國事第一」，「工作第一」。不像普通社會小姐，專在「奢侈至上」，「戀愛至上」上用功夫。</p>
<p>小老虎的睡眠問題，並無驚人的表演：一·由於他貪食，肚子一飽，就想瞌睡；二·一個才十二三的孩子，正在發育頭上，天然要睡。固然他有一身武工，可以熬困，但完全出於勉强。我們也不讓他失去充分的睡眠，只要工作不太緊張，總讓他充分休息。自從參加工作以來，尤其是在耀羣身邊的時候，從不讓他熬困，以免妨害他的發育。但我可以預料，等他長大成人之後，他的耐久能力，絕對不在W君之下。</p>
<p>關於我個人的睡眠問題，部是一段神話。當初，學生時代，自恃有些强記本領，平日只讀雜書，絕對不念功課，到了考試，僅需一兩度夜車，十多門功課，準可門門及格；有的學科，甚至還可弄到最優成績。</p>
<p>神話的由來，還在舊制高中卒業考試的一回，幾位主要科目敎員，偏生都是二十八宿裏兇神惡煞胎，幾度月考，嘗過他們的滋味；正筆之外，還帶走偏鋒。尤其那位數理主任，把學生當作他的七世究家；十個試題，至少有五個是從課本夾縫裏剔爬出來的冷門材料。所以全級同班，不問素日用功與否，爲了「文憑至上」，都得開夜車。而這畢業考試，又有五六天之長；精神再好些，也不能述接維持五六天夜車；况且日裏還得經過「槌擊帶疲勞轟炸一式的考試。</p>
<p>那時，我就碰到一位神學科同學，（聽說現在杭州某名寺當知客），他瞧着我們可憐，敎給我們一種一疏困」方式，把八小時睡眠，改作十二頓零碎休息；呌作什麼「休罷覺禪功」，每頓休息，僅需十分鐘左右；並且無需上床，隨地舉行。其口訣是「安坐」，「埀簾」，「扶膝」，「足踏實地」，「定一」，「周天流息」，「醒覺」，七個步驟。前四步當然易懂易行，換句話，就是把身體各部位都安頓下，放下心事，交託給那張坐椅，和脚踏的那一方地皮。「定一」，就是想像眼睛在看自己的下丹田，一圓圓球的中心點。「周天流息」就是把全身腑臟脈絡當作五湖四海，把那想像的小圓球發動起來，走海底，背脊上升，經頭腦各部，由左或右肢體各骨節流動，每到一個節，停頓一下，像週游五湖四海一樣，直到遊遍全身，回到原位。</p>
<h3>水車</h3>
<p>— 胡應東</p>
<p>生長在水鄉裏的人們，水是他們的生命的泉源。你看那稻田綠色的彼浪，它在烈日之下，還是長得壯健而精神的樣子。</p>
<p>水車在湖沼邊發出有節奏的聲音。</p>
<p>一座凉棚，凉棚下面的赤膊莊稼漢有一副紫色的發亮的胸膛，黝黑色的粗而有勁的腿，一上一下地踏着就這樣，看一泓湖水潺潺地流進了稻田，連稻田裘的靑蛙，也愉快地開始歌唱了；作物們挺起了腰幹來迎接着水源，臨風招展，綠色的微笑展開在田野。水車在輾轉。</p>
<p>綠色在波動，莊稼漢流着汗鼓起了希望的眼睛，哼着村歌，讓水車無休止的轉動轉動……</p>
<p>力的啓示，水的奔流，汗與希望的跳躍。</p>
<p>水鄉的人把希望寄托在水車的歌唱裏，它，水鄉的勞動的母親，有着　沛的奶水哺育田野，……</p>
<p>勞動的聲音高揚在夏之水鄉的每一個角落。</p>
<p>夏，一個生長的季節，水鄉的勞動者是不會浪費它的。</p>

<h3>濟助殉難報人家屬</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>値得我們臘傲的，敵僞時期許多新聞記者，不屈不撓地和敵人搏鬥，許多人倒在血泊裏，許多人受到威骨，許多人失去自由，許多人受了酷刑，變成殘廢，這免新聞史上量輝煌燦爛的一頁</p>
<p>但是那必兩難報人的家屬，却過着貧病交迫的生活，那些遭受敵偶慘刑至今尚滯留病榻的記者，却很少有人關心。</p>
<p>這些殉難與受難的報人，他們所以正義彪炳，肝胆照人，衹有一個信條，就是衹有民族的利益，沒有個人的利益。他們不安協，不變節，不落水，拒絕一切威脅利誘，不甘興敵僞同流合汚，這是値得我們大書特書的。</p>
<p>他們雖然身在上海，但與前綫作戰並無二致；炸彈·手槍。天天在他們週圍恐嚇，爆炸，但是，這並不能動搖他們的信念。</p>
<p>現在本報爲殉難報人家屬募集捐款，只要稍有正義感的人，一定不會拒絕這個請求；只要稍稍知道洋商報紙如何與敵僞鬥爭史的人，一定更能慷慨解囊，爲什麼不獻出一點金錢，作爲我們對於殉難報人家屬的敬意呢？</p>
<p>死者已矣，生者尚在艱苦備嘗地支撑着這不容易對付的生活，我們除了給予實際的援助以外，是無法减少我們心理上的內疚的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>馬歇爾與魏德邁</h3>
<p>— 雷嬰</p>
<p>許多人似乎以爲馬歇爾和魏德邁的政策有絕然不同的地方。也有許多人說，馬歇爾在中國的失敗，已經使他威名掃地了。</p>
<p>他們不知道，艾森豪威爾本來不過是麥克阿瑟手下一員褲將，把他一手提拔起來，讓他獨當一面的，正是馬歇爾。他們不知道，負責決定諾曼第登陸，開闢第二戰綫，使納粹德國終於瓦解的，並非「執行」的艾森豪威爾，而是「決策」的馬歇爾。他們也許更不知道，一手把魏德邁自一個一九三八年剛從德國留學回來的軍曹，在一九四〇年擢爲上校，再把他漸漸在六年之間一直升到二級上將的地位的——也正是馬歇爾！</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍雖然已經銀髮蕭然，但事實上在美軍將領中是年事較輕，也是比較後輩的一位，他的才智使他在美國軍略史上發出了異彩；因之，他今日的比較「後進」倒也許指示了他的更輝煌的未可限量的將來。許多美國專家們已經在竊竊私語，他是最可能的馬歇爾和艾森豪威爾的繼任人了。魏德邁於一九三六年八月至一九三八年六月之間，在柏林的德國陸軍大學實習。他是一個處處留神的「有心人」，回國之後，馬上就把一部厚達一百夏的報告書呈到陸軍部。正好，那時美國陸軍部裏負實這一類報告的一位將領，正是現在赫赫聲譽的馬歇爾——，他那時還是馬歇爾「准將」。</p>
<p>馬歇爾一看見這份報告書，大爲激賞。他從此就和魏德邁經常保持接觸，到一九四〇年的時候，魏德邁已經成爲馬歇爾將軍的最重要的智囊之一了。</p>
<p>一九四二年四月，美軍參謀部根據一切最可靠的情報和各種統計材料，斷定一九四三年是渡過海峽，向諾曼第直接登陸的最好的機會。羅斯福的特使霍浦金斯，偕同馬歇爾將軍和馬歇爾的隨員們飛抵英國，把美軍參謀部的意見徵求英方的同意。在唐寗街十號英相官邸爭辯了好幾天之後，英皇喬治御駕親臨，總算是採納了美軍的主張。可是，過了兩個月之後，蒙巴頓勛爲（現任英國印度總督）突然自英飛英，成爲白宮的上賓。他一再申說一九四三年開闢第二戰綫之不妥，先是表示懷疑，後來是提供了堅決的論證。他逗留了二個星期，在六月十八日，邱吉爾自已也到了白宮。他的說話比蒙巴頓高明多了，他說，盟國民衆正在水深火熱之中，大軍不應當再遲運不發。他建議立刻進攻地中海，特別着眼巴爾幹。邱吉爾的議論雖然是頭頭是道，可是馬歇爾和羅斯福一樣心裏都很明白：邱吉爾是在打大英帝國的算盤。邱吉爾反對諾曼第登陸；他說，德軍元氣未傷，如果貿然一試，一定要造成第二次鄧扣克。</p>
<p>邱翁的滔滔雄辯結束之後，羅斯福立刻和馬歇爾進行會商。馬歇爾靜靜聽完了總統的意見之後，馬上就回過身來，對一位瘦長的上校說，「你可以說一說何以美國必須堅持諾曼第登陸戰，而且戰爭必須在一九四三年進行。」</p>
<p>這位上校立刻有條不紊的說出了種種理由，以邱吉爾的雄辯，對於這位冷靜的專家的論斷也見得暗然失色了。</p>
<p>這位瘦長的上校，就是今日的二級上將魏德邁，他背誦出一切的數字，準確地預測了蘇軍反攻的時候，正和一九四三計劃配會。</p>
<p>羅斯福終於採取了折衷之道，戰略是依美軍的，諾曼第登陸，時間則依了英國，延遲一年，改爲一九四四。</p>
<p>到今日，一切事物都證明了美國估計的準確。一九四三年夏，德軍軍力祇有二十九師，到一九四四登陸戰開始的時候，德軍已補充到五十八師了。盟軍延遲作戰了一年的結果，德軍在西綫的防務也已經加强。而且，一九四二年冬，蘇軍正在艱苦中克復了史太林格勒，如果盟軍在一九四三進攻的話，那麼今日的德國，就無蘇聯揷足的餘地了。</p>
<p>堅持這一九四三進攻計劃的，是馬歇爾；擬具這個計劃的，就是當時的魏德邁上校。從這裏，可以看到馬歇爾和魏德邁的關係是何等深切了。</p>
<h3>如此爸爸</h3>
<p>— 羅塔</p>
<p>我們的女孩子一連發熱十多天，我要夜夜起來服侍，弄得十分疲乏。最後我對丈夫說：「今夜她再嚷的話，你起來好了。」當夜她嚷着要開水喝，我把丈夫推醒，他一骨碌爬起來，跑到廚房裏去盛一杯開水自己喝下後，再回到床上，呼呼地入睡了。</p>
<h3>于吉這個人</h3>
<p>— 周冷</p>
<p>！魏晉人特雜論之三</p>
<p>羅貫中筆下的三國演義，是把子吉　成一個方術之士，說他會呼風喚兩，會屍解還魂，甚至最後還用妖術，把個本領高强的孫策嚇死的。而其實，照我看來，于吉却是當時一個從事秘密工作不幸中途失敗的農民領袖，一個敎育農民起來鬥爭的理論家。</p>
<p>這論據，要詳細列舉事實證明，由於他的史料經過歷代文士歪典斧删，已經頗爲困難了，但有一點是可以確信的，那就是：自靈帝中平元年（一八四年）張角所發動的「黃巾」叛亂，而迄靈帝達安二十年（二百十五年）的張魯領導「米賊」瓦解，縱貫這幾十年的中國有各農民暴亂，他們的思想行動，可以說是受了于吉的理論所影響所煽動的。後漢書襄稽傳：</p>
<p>「初，順常時，瑯瑯宮崇詣　上卹于吉，於曲泉水上得神賽百七十卷，號大平淸領書，所司奏上，妖妄不經，乃收藏之。後張角頗有其書焉。」</p>
<p>大凡封建社會裏的有計劃的一農民暴動，不論中外，在開始時候，差不多都是借神道作爲活動的工具，藉宗敎的信條，表現他們政治意識的。近者如淸代太平天國革命，遠者如德國千年太平敎　爭，都是著例。考于吉當時。正是黃巾賊亂的前夕，社會環境，據晋書卷二六食貨志記載：「桓帝永興元年，羣國少半遭蝗，河泛數千里，流人數十萬戶，建寗永和之初，西美反叛，廿餘年，兵連師老，軍旅之費，三百廿馀億，府帑空虛，及董卓之亂，谷一斛五十萬，豆麥二十萬，人相食啖，白骨盈積，殘骸餘肉，臭穢道路。」你想，作爲治於人者的農民，生活旣然沒法過去，當然就會孕育挺而走險的思想的。因而，于吉恰在此時發現神書，書中又是妖妄不經，那以常情來推論，所謂神出也者，說不定就是他自已所著小册子，一種批評社會鼓動鬥爭的宣傳品來，爲了掩蔽別人注目，才虛構這麼一個神話來借託吧了，不然，于吉爲什麼不像其他的術士一樣秘藏起來，專利取巧，再不然，爲什麼所司竟然也會獲得，呈上邀功，更不然爲什麼張角有了這書，竟然會興兵作亂？</p>
<p>同時，以于吉這人的行爲而論，也更可以知道他是極有野心的。三國志吳書孫策傳註引江表傳有段很精彩描寫：</p>
<p>「于吉先寓東方，往來吳會，立精舍，燒香讀道書，制作符水以治病。吳會人多事之。（孫）策嘗於羣城門樓上集會諸將賓客，吉乃盛服趨度，門下諸將賓客三分之二下樓迎拜之。　　者呵禁不能止，策即令收之。諸事之者悉使婦女入見策母教之，母勸策，策曰：此子妖妄，能幻滅衆心，使諸將不復　君臣之禮，不可不除也。諸將復連名通白事陳乞之，策不聽，即催斬之，　首於市。」</p>
<p>假定于吉單純僅是一個術士，那斷不會來往吳會，這麼殷勤替老百姓服務的。要不是和東吳諸將賓客有了組織關係，也斷不會有這麼大力量，其至使他們忘記君臣之禮，而「下樓迎拜」的。于吉之所以被殺死，恐怕還不祗是孫策見他甚得人心，而是因爲他的地下工作已獲很好成績，組織力量已發生很大作用，於是，或者是他憑着一股農民的英雄思想，故意於孫策集會時向他示一下威；或者是他的計劃成熟，圖謀那時起事，結果給孫策抓着，拿去斬首的。不然，以孫策這麼有名的一個孝子，竟敢逆他母親的話？諸將賓客竟然連名呈請？事後，搜神記等也說是于吉取他的性命？把這事跡互相對照聯想起來，則可見內客一定不如外値所述這麼簡單的。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>木偶戲在美國</p>
<p>木偶戲是中國的產物，一百年前的木偶戲長這樣，現今的木偶戲還是這樣，一只木　，要木偶的站在布幃裏，牽動那拙劣的木偶，唱出不入耳的腔調，博得販夫走卒，街頭兒童的零星鈔票。還有一種江湖人物是「關亡婆」，她的肚子裏會說話，不過聲音很小，要把耳朶貼近她的肚皮方可聽到，其實不是她的肚皮會說話，依然是她的喉嚨，聲音往下，好像悶在肚皮裏，這兩種職業都不成器，可以糊口而難於發迹。美國人就不同了，好萊塢出了一名波根，他把「木偶』和「關亡婆」合而爲一，他閉了嘴說話，響亮流利，雖一千人以上的戲院，也可響徹全院，他架起右腿，膝上坐了一位着禮服的木偶查利，五官四肢都能行動，彼根一方面代查利說話，一方面代自己說話，他甚至於可以摻入第三者的語調，一個人代表三個人，劇詞以滑稽對白爲主，波根對於他的搖錢樹查利愛護無微不至，查利臥室中有大批行頭，但事實上查利平時上台所穿的却老是那麼一套舊禮服，一根舊領結，一付單眼鏡，現在美國追踵而起的已有多人，他們的木偶男女老小都有，相聲技能也可急起直追，但名起和號召力德沒有查利那麼大，「好萊塢軍人俱樂部」Hollywood　Canteen一片中就有查利的鏡頭，查利也曾被請到總統府去，坐在羅斯福夫人旁邊，成爲白宮的佳賓，博得不少采聲，這種天才人物在美國，成爲第一流藝術家，在中國成爲街頭賣藝或役使亡魂的騙子，豈不可嘆也夫。（編者按：如若有機會，希望徐先生說一說提線木偶戲。）（二四）</p>
<h3>螢窗消夏錄</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>朱皋墓</p>
<p>西湖樓霞山背，有牛皋墓。牛皋是岳武穆手下一名大將，也可稱得是一位民族英雄。然而荒墟古木，一片荒凉，遊人很少知道輔文侯的墓道的。據說，「昔有牧童載夕陽而過嶺，踞石溺焉。忽一偉丈夫，黑而髯，怒訶日：某牛皋也，胡爲溺吾首，推之墮澗，深下丈餘，一塚負壑，草叢覆焉。果皋墓也。於是好事者始稍加修葺之。」這個傳說當然荒唐不可靠，以侯之勇猛忠武，如英靈不滅，也決不會顯成於于一個小小牧童。然而，由此也可見同爲英雄，其身後哀榮，也是有幸有不幸的了。閩侯林紓亦記牛皋墓一節云，「一日遊紫雲洞，無意問住佾，遂得輔文候之墓。墓砌石作圓形，荊榛殆滿。無路足至墓下。時余東道主人爲陳君，方授仁和縣，余請陳君爲修侯墓。陳君諾，出三百金，付諸奴子黃福，余爲作碑文，詎黃，嗇于侯墓，而豐碑亭，墓僅去草而已，而亭則煥然金碧，以石爲柱。一夕大雷雨，事圯而碑巋然。余竊自太息，謂俟尚有靈。」</p>
<p>此事很少人知道，也可算是西湖的一個掌故。然而，時移日遷，又復荊莽叢生，人跡罕至，牛大哥也眞是運蹇的。現在只有「宋輔文候牛公之墓」的碑文，尚可辨識，據說爲陳小　君所　題者。嗚呼，安得更有好事者爲牛大哥驅地下狐狸耶？</p>
<h3>深海裏的魚族</h3>
<p>— 王戈兩</p>
<p>海，還仍含有許多秘密的謎呢！我們人類潛水最高記錄，不過僅僅千米而已，普通的海之深度約在三千至六千米，一九二七年德國軍艦「耶母頓」號，在菲律濱羣島中的民答諾島東方海面上，發現了一萬零八百三十米的深海，其深度佔世界第一位，如果把世界最高峯——額非勒士峯裝下去，還看不見峯尖呢！（還差半海哩）</p>
<p>一般人對於海面下二千米的地方，因爲食物關係，也許會想到魚族們的生活困難吧，但是根據歷來調查隊的報告，他們所踏查的深海區，意外的也會發現魚類棲居着。在六千米的深海裏，此類深海魚族，大都是黑色或淡灰色，少鱗介，長有皮革一般似的表皮，有二三寸長的以及五六尺長的各種大小魚類。</p>
<p>歐美各國生物學研究者，往往以鋼鐵製成的深水滒行球，冒險潛入海底，以觀察深海魚類生活的情形，在潛行球降沉海底的途中，海的顏色由藍變成綠，以至於灰色，待超過五百米的時候，就成了漆黑色，可是在裝有强烈照明設備的潛行球的窗子裏，仍可看出種種珍奇稀有的東西。例如有種魚，它的下鰐以及尾稍上，生有鞭裝的附加物，並且會發出奇綺的光彩來。還有種魚，自身的體積很小，但它却能吞食比自己肢體還大的魚，它的胃袋像風船布帆一樣鼓脹着、它所吞食的魚，全在胃袋裏蜷伏貯藏着，慢慢地才消化呢。另有種魚，它生有比自身長約四倍的鈎絲，在上顎突出着，而且那鈎絲的前端，還有着特意誘惑海鳧的發光物，它長在礁岩隙處隱藏着，靜靜等着海鳧的來臨，海鳧悠悠地在波上浮遊着，爲那岩石上的發光體所引誘而靠近了，於是這奇妙的小魚，忽的一下就能把海鳧捉捕着，作爲一頓豐富的晚餐。</p>
<p>最有趣而奇怪的是呌「司匹尼普司」學名的雄魚，它只會在雌魚身上如瘤般的黏附着，它的嘴部，完全是合雌體融和在一起的，自己不能食物和消化，完全依賴雌魚的營養而活着，它的職責僅僅是使雌魚受精而已，眞是名符其實的「寄生物」。</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer Special Envoy Leaves Honolulu, Will Fly Directly to Nanjing via Guam, Plans Trip to Shanghai After Deployment in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 20th] The US Embassy officially announced today that, according to a recent telegram from General Wedemeyer, he is scheduled to fly directly from Guam to Nanjing around 4 pm on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to reliable sources from the US military here: General Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly directly to Nanjing from Guam by military plane tomorrow (22nd), without stopping in Shanghai. Key US military personnel stationed in Shanghai have all received orders to fly to Nanjing by special plane tomorrow morning to welcome the special envoy and hold discussions. The US military also stated that General Wedemeyer is flying directly to Nanjing because he urgently wants to meet with Chairman Chiang and other government officials. After completing the deployment in Nanjing, he will take time to visit Shanghai. This is General Wedemeyer's third visit to China. In 1944, he succeeded the late General Stilwell as Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in China, and his contributions were well-known. After the victory of the war, when the US military headquarters was established in Shanghai, he returned to the United States for a while, but soon returned to Shanghai. He was recalled to the United States in the summer of 1946. This time, he was ordered to come to China again to inspect the current general situation in our country. He has been unanimously welcomed by the government and various parties. It is reported that Mr. Wedemeyer will stay in our country for more than a month to discuss various related issues in detail with the government authorities. In addition, Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao by flagship at 3 pm this afternoon (21st). People from all walks of life in China and the United States in this city, because Admiral Cooke has been away from Shanghai for a long time, have prepared to welcome him. According to a spokesperson for the US Naval Electrical Authority here: It has not yet been decided whether Admiral Cooke will go to Beijing to meet with General Wedemeyer. It is reported that Mr. Cooke will stay in Shanghai for six days and return to Qingdao by the original ship on the 27th.</p>
<p>[United Press Honolulu 20th] General Wedemeyer stated on the 20th that the delegation he leads to study aid to China is not subject to any kind of restrictions. He issued this statement to clarify his remarks on Friday to the press. The explanation was that "aid from the Marshall Plan may be extended to China and Korea, including all areas under Soviet domination." Wedemeyer's publicity consultant, Watson, stated that the delegation would study the situation in the East for at least six weeks, and its actions would therefore depend on the results of its research. Watson stated that General Wedemeyer cannot make statements about his hopes or intentions. The entire study will be an "objective study." Wedemeyer's party is scheduled to leave here by US Army transport plane on the 20th to China.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 20th] Observers here believe that after Wedemeyer arrives in Beijing, he will not consult with Chinese officials for at least the first two days, except for formal meetings. Instead, he will convene advisors and embassy staff, including Ambassador Stuart, to focus on listening to recent reports to begin the investigation. This work may be limited to evaluating the reports provided by the National Government and the US Embassy. Some people speculate whether Chairman Chiang will invoke the precedent of treating Marshal [George] Marshall in the past and invite the special envoy to go to Kuling. It is believed that Wedemeyer, in view of the implications of Marshal [George] Marshall's experience, may stay in Beijing for the summer to avoid hindering his mission of conducting an impartial investigation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] With General Wedemeyer's arrival in China imminent, the government has specially invited Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, to go to Beijing for consultations in order to gather opinions from all parties. Mr. Zhang has accepted the invitation and is scheduled to go to Beijing today with Xu Chuanlin and Ji Yiqiao. Before his departure, Mr. Zhang stated: After General Wedemeyer arrives in China, we should frankly tell him the actual situation of our country's politics, military affairs, and economy. This will be helpful to the overall situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing 20th] Amid government preparations to receive General Wedemeyer, it is widely rumored again among political and business circles that the Executive Yuan will be reorganized soon. Informally, it is said that the government will make changes to the personnel of the Executive Yuan, including the internal transfer of Dr. Gu Weijun to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the transfer of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to serve as Minister of Education, and the appointment of Minister Chen Lifu as Minister of Social Affairs, in order to cooperate with the implementation of the General Mobilization Order. More and more Chinese people are gradually agreeing with the views of American newspapers, believing that although Wedemeyer is a friend of China in times of trouble, he will not bring a large number of items needed by China this time. His main equipment will only be a blank notebook. It is reported that various government departments, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Resources Committee, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will submit reports to Wedemeyer separately. The reports of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will involve the peace treaty with Japan and the opening of trade with Japan.</p>

<h3>General Du Yuming Arrives in Shanghai, Lung Disease Relapses, Will Go to the United States for Treatment, Talks About the Situation in the Northeast Becoming Stable</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security, is about to go abroad for treatment. He left Shenyang for Ping on the morning of the 19th, and flew from Ping to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, arriving at Jiangwan Airport at 4 pm. Accompanying him were Mr. Du's wife, six sons and daughters, Zhang Tingmeng, Commander of the Air Force of the Northeast Military Region, Yu Jizhong, President of the China-Soviet Daily, etc., and he brought a doctor to take care of him on the plane. Representatives from military, political, party and group circles in this city went to the airport to welcome him, including Zhang Bide, representative of Mayor Wu, Shen Xiaofeng, representative of Commander Xuan, Xiang Changquan, representative of Speaker Pan, Fang Zhi and Xie Renzhao from the Municipal Party Department, and Xi Yushu from the Municipal Council, etc., more than 200 people. Mr. Du was wearing a blue silk robe, white socks and black cloth shoes, his face was pale, and beads of sweat were like beans on his face. After being supported off the plane by attendants, he first shook hands with representatives from all walks of life, and then Shanghai ladies Liu Deming and Song Minzhi presented flowers on behalf of the Friends of the Army Society. Because Mr. Du was weak due to illness and could not stand in the sun for a long time, he was immediately carried into a car on a stretcher and driven to the Dahua Hospital on Baojian Road for rest. The hospital sent two nurses to the airport to take care of him at that time. Mr. Du is going abroad for treatment this time because of a relapse of his old lung disease. At the same time, his legs were chilled due to directing operations outside the customs, and he has not yet recovered. Therefore, he needs to go abroad for treatment. There is still about a week's delay in handling the formalities for going abroad in Shanghai. It has not yet been decided where to go in the United States, and how long to stay will depend on the condition of the disease. As for his wife and sons, they will stay in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This reporter then visited Mr. Du at Dahua Hospital to inquire about the current situation in the Northeast. According to him, the situation in the Northeast has been quite stable since the victory in Siping Street, and the Communist bandits will not have the strength to launch a fourth offensive in the short term. The Communist bandits have a strong force in the Northeast because they have a backstage to supply food, salaries and ammunition, but compared with the National Army, they are still inferior and are only of a roving nature. There are Korean communists and Japanese prisoners participating in the bandit army. The number of Korean communists is at least more than 100,000, and the Japanese prisoners are only 4,000 or 5,000. Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, in terms of land, the Communist bandits occupy about one-half, in terms of population, the National Army area occupies three-fifths, and in terms of resources, 80% of the production area is in the hands of the National Army. The general popular sentiment and morale in the Northeast are very good. Regarding the rumors that there are still Japanese troops in the Changbai Mountain area refusing to surrender and resisting stubbornly, Mr. Du said that he could not confirm it. He believes that it is impossible for Japan to rise again in the Northeast. The reporter asked whether the general public in the Northeast missed Zhang Xueliang. Mr. Du said, "They have almost forgotten him." Mr. Du also said that his trip abroad was purely for recuperation and there were no other tasks.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] With the universal election about to begin, the councillors remaining in Beijing held a symposium on the 19th to discuss the technical and timing issues of the election, and decided to request Zhang Qianhua, Da Pusheng and other four to present their opinions to the authorities.

<h3>Some Councillors Advocate Postponing Universal Election</h3>
<p>To Be Held After the Suppression of Rebellion Is Completed</p>
<p>It is also heard that some councillors advocate that it may be inappropriate to conduct a universal election under the current situation. Therefore, it has been decided to request the authorities to postpone it and not conduct it in the contradictory situation of suppressing the rebellion on one hand and holding elections on the other. The universal election will be held after the military suppression of the rebellion is over. At the same time, the councillors believe that the regulation that the current legislators are the natural candidates should also be enjoyed equally by the councillors, and the councillors should also be the natural candidates for the legislators.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Local Governments, The Principle Is No Longer a Problem</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] This reporter asked Mr. Zhang Junmai about the reorganization of local governments yesterday. He replied: "I have always advocated that to reform politics, we should first reorganize local governments, and to reorganize local governments, we should first have scholars in charge of politics. The government has already accepted this principle. The candidates from various parties to participate in the local governments are still under negotiation. As far as the Democratic Socialist Party is concerned, we may not participate in practical work. Regarding the universal election, the negotiations in Beijing, I believe that there may be results in two weeks or ten days. There should be no problem with this example election." When asked whether there is any possibility of reconciliation in the internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party, Mr. Zhang said: If the Innovation Committee can be cancelled, there is still a possibility of reconciliation.</p>

<h3>National Army Crosses the Wen River in Separate Routes, The Battle of Yanzhou Has Won Preliminary Victory, The Remnants of the Communist Bandits Are Encircled and Annihilated in the Plains</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 20th] The Western National Army, which went south from the Tai'an area, occupied Anjiazhuang on the 19th and crossed the Wen River on the 20th, marching towards Ningyang. The Eastern National Army also joined forces with another unit of the National Army after recapturing Dawenkou and crossing the Wen River, and is now encircling and attacking the bandits on the periphery of Yanzhou with the Southern National Army.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] The National Army on the north bank of the Wen River recovered Anjiazhuang, west of Dawenkou, at 6:00 pm on the 19th, annihilating and capturing more than 500 Communist bandits. Also, more than 15,000 Communist bandits from the First and Second Columns of Ke Bocheng's troops and the Yellow River Detachment launched a fierce attack on the city of Wenshang on the evening of the 19th. The defending troops fought back calmly. By the morning of the 20th, the Communist bandits suffered more than 5,000 casualties and collapsed, leaving more than 3,000 bodies.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 20th] In the Battle of Yanzhou, the National Army has won a preliminary victory. Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng attempted to converge on the periphery of Yanzhou and strike a blow to the National Army in southwestern Shandong. They did not expect that because they were far away from the mountainous area, they were like tigers entering the plains, giving the National Army a good opportunity to annihilate them. In addition, the fertile land of southwestern Shandong is a vast plain, which is an ideal environment for the activities of mechanized troops. The distance between Yanzhou, Jining and Zouteng and the rear of the National Army is also close, and trains and highways can reach directly, so supplies and reinforcements can be obtained easily. Therefore, when the reporter visited a military observer on the 20th, he was greeted with a smile, and told that although the National Army had given up the outer strongholds such as Wenshang, Yang, Jiaxiang, and Juye due to strategic needs, the Jining offensive and defensive battle that started on the 17th had annihilated more than one column of Communist bandits, with more than 20,000 casualties. The Communist army on the periphery of Yanzhou was attacked by the National Army from the north and south, and the casualties also exceeded 10,000. The encirclement of Jinxiang and Yangshanji in the northwest has been lifted, and the losses of the Communist bandits are at least more than 20,000. If the losses in the Battle of Zou Bing are included, they should be at least 60,000. It is not an exaggeration to call it a great victory.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] The Jining offensive and defensive battle is fierce. More than 50,000 Communist bandits from the First, Third, and Tenth Columns of the East China Field Army and the Seventh Column of Liu Bocheng's troops launched a fierce attack on Jining again on the night of the 19th. The defending troops fought back bravely, and the battle was tragic. They are still fighting. The National Army in Jushanji attacked the defeated bandit troops in the northwest on the morning of the 20th, and successively captured five or six villages, including Gejiadian, annihilating more than 1,000 bandits.</p>

The First and Fourth Columns of Communist bandits, which fled north from Teng County, harassed Lai County on the night of the 19th and were repelled on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xinlai, 20th] Two thousand Communist troops who sneaked from southern Shandong to the east and west of Shiliushu in the Donghai area yesterday shouted that they would attack Xuzhou.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Chinese Situation: Believes the Soviet Union Plans to Seize Xinjiang and Drives the Chinese Communists to Create a Chaotic Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The Conservative Party's highly respected "Yorkshire Post" published a lengthy editorial on the Chinese situation, believing that the Soviet Union harbors ambitions to covet Xinjiang Province in China, all of Central Asia, and even areas within the Indian border. The newspaper pointed out that in recent years, the trade of Xinjiang Province has mostly developed westward via the Turkestan Railway, rather than taking the six-week journey through the Gobi Desert to reach Peiping. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union will eventually find a way to seize Xinjiang. In addition, the Soviet Union also intends to use the Chinese Communists as a vanguard to occupy all of the three eastern provinces. The newspaper urged China to eliminate the Marxist faction and the Kuomintang reactionaries to thwart the Soviet Union's schemes and alleviate the suffering of the people. The newspaper said, "China is indeed in a state of suffering. The eight-year war has destroyed the entire administrative system. Although the individual qualities of its cabinet members are better than those of previous governments, experienced and trustworthy officials are still rare. The Communist Party's claim that they are the 'only friends of the peasants' has been proven false. The Chinese Communists are clearly doing their best to create chaos and suffering to overthrow the National Government and establish their own position in the ruined state. We still recall that in Chinese history, when a dynasty collapsed, the chaotic situation was similar to the situation in China today. The difference is that today's China must learn the new political methods of the West. More importantly, it must eliminate the two stubborn factions of Marxists and reactionaries. These two factions disregard the interests of the country and continue the war to achieve their own ambitions."</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Recent Fierce Battle Between Gao Shu-xun and the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 20th] According to reliable sources: The reason for the fierce battle between Gao Shu-xun and the bandits was that Gao failed to borrow money from the bandits in Changzhi. He then confiscated the branch of the Southern Hebei Bank and surrounded the pseudo-Special Commissioner's Office. The Communist bandits arbitrarily massacred Gao's cadres. In a fit of rage, Gao occupied their production workshops, confiscated local armed forces, and appointed administrative personnel. To suppress the incident, the Communist bandits urgently transferred two brigades from northern Henan, commanded by Chen Geng, to surround Gao's troops. Gao also gathered his troops and launched a fierce battle with the bandits.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Meeting of the Conference for Peace with Japan Convened: Soviet Union Expresses Refusal to Participate, United States Strongly Advocates Signing a Peace Treaty with Japan Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 20th (Broadcast): According to the Soviet Embassy in the United States, the Soviet Union has refused to participate in the peace conference with Japan initiated by the United States. The U.S. State Department has acknowledged this statement.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Although U.S. officials encountered setbacks from Britain and its dominions in the first session, they still expressed their utmost determination to advocate signing a peace treaty with Japan soon. At the same time, the United States expressed disappointment that it could not begin action next month because Britain, Australia, and New Zealand were scheduled to hold a meeting in August to discuss the same issue. However, U.S. experts believe that they have already received a fundamentally hopeful response to the U.S. invitation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is said that, except for the Soviet Union, the other ten countries involved in the matter have agreed in principle to proceed with the Japanese peace treaty. U.S. public opinion also strongly supports this action. The Netherlands has unconditionally accepted the U.S. invitation. Authorities said that the French ambassador had indicated that his government had no major difficulties with the matter, and it is believed that the Philippines, China, and Canada largely agreed.</p>
<p>The United States, which must bear the cost of the occupation of Japan, believes that although Japan must still be under Allied control for military matters, the time is ripe for Japan to become economically and politically self-reliant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress will release new evidence indicating a growing trend in favor of this policy. The emergence of this trend can be seen in the House Appropriations Committee's consultation on the cost of the occupied areas. For example, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Engel, criticized: "Japan and Korea are indeed no longer countries that pose a military threat. What is the benefit of occupying Japan? So why not conclude a treaty with them, stay out of it, and let them manage their own affairs?"</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] It is rumored here that an Australian official statement said: The Australian Prime Minister said that Australia will participate in the preliminary meeting of the eleven countries suggested by the United States to discuss the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>Impressions of a U.S. Journalists Delegation on Japan: Has Democracy Sprouted in Japan? Believes the Japanese are Not Deceiving the Allies!</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Ten American news editors who visited Japan at the invitation of the U.S. Department of the Army returned to Tokyo on the 20th after inspecting various parts of Japan and are scheduled to go to Korea on the 22nd. Reporters accompanied them on their inspection of various parts of Japan and learned their impressions as follows: According to informal suggestions from British and American sources, the Allied control organization after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of the chief diplomatic representatives of the countries of the Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission. A gathering of chief diplomats is more important than other types of control organizations because diplomats have extensive experience in these matters and are not easily swayed by external pressures. It is hoped that the United Nations can establish a certain military organization not only to take necessary military precautions when the terms of the Japanese peace treaty are being discussed.</p>
<p>Almost all the prominent figures who met with the U.S. journalists agreed that a war between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is impossible. Most Allied leaders in Japan believe that the Japanese people are sincere in cooperating with MacArthur. Some countries are deeply afraid that the Japanese will deceive the Allies with false friendship, but this concern is excessive. There are now various reasons to believe that democracy is indeed sprouting in Japan, that the Japanese can indeed become a peace-loving nation, and that they can be a model for Asian countries! Some authorities are deeply afraid that Japan will compete with Britain, America, and other countries in the international market, but they do not know that Japan's exports can be restricted so that it cannot engage in unfair competition with other countries.</p>
<h3>Experts on Japanese Issues Hold a Symposium in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Japan</p>
<p>[Local News] Xu Yiqiao, president of Transformation Publishing House, and Fang Qiuwei, editor-in-chief of Asia Century Monthly, in view of the upcoming convocation of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan, specially invited experts on Japanese issues to hold a symposium on the peace treaty with Japan at the publishing house yesterday (the 20th) at 4:00 PM to promote the attention of people from all walks of life. Wang Yunsheng, Shao Yulin, Liu Baimin, Zhou Changshou, Li Qiusheng, Luo Dunwei, Meng Xianzhang, Wu Juenong, Cui Wanqiu, Song Yuelun, Zhao Nanrou, and more than a dozen others attended, with Xu Yiqiao chairing. The content of the symposium focused on the following issues: (1) The fundamental policy of the peace treaty with Japan, (2) The time and place of holding the peace conference, (3) The territorial issue of Japan, (4) The issue of reparations, (5) The issue of restoring Japan's international trade, (6) The issue of Japan's control after the establishment of the peace treaty. The experts spoke very enthusiastically. They all believed that the peace treaty with Japan would determine the overall situation in the Far East for the next century, that the government should be fully prepared, that the people should pay close attention, that the basic policy of the peace treaty should be based on the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, and that Japanese militarism should be thoroughly eliminated economically, politically, and ideologically to ensure world peace. As for MacArthur's proposal to hold the peace conference in Tokyo, all the experts expressed their opposition. The symposium ended at around 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Legislators Xiao Zheng and Huang Yuanbin Discuss Opening Trade with Japan: Our Country's Industrial and Commercial Circles Focus on the Nanyang Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 19th] Since Supervisory Committee member Yu Shude and others suggested temporarily suspending the opening of trade with Japan, all parties have paid close attention to it. Yesterday, reporters visited legislators Xiao Zheng and Huang Yuanbin to inquire about their views on the matter. Both agreed that there was no need to be overly concerned.</p>
<p>Xiao Zheng's Opinion</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao went to Japan before the war and is very knowledgeable on Japanese issues. According to him: The resumption of Sino-Japanese trade is only a matter of time. Although some people oppose trading with Japan before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, they do not oppose trading with Japan. In this era of international free trade, China is willing to supply Japan with a considerable amount of raw materials. Some people oppose transporting salt and soybeans to Japan, but this is not necessary, because if our country has a surplus, it can be transported to Japan. Regarding the transportation of Japanese goods to China, we oppose Japan recognizing China as the end of its shoddy industrial products and dumping easy-to-sell goods to China in political or improper ways. We do not want to excessively suppress normal Sino-Japanese trade. Mr. Xiao believes that Japan is currently working hard to restore its light industry, but as we observe it, Japan should first try to restore its agriculture and agricultural processing before discussing the restoration of industry. When the reporter asked what impact the opening of Japan's international trade would have on our country in competing for the Nanyang market, Mr. Xiao said: As far as the future industrial outlet of our country is concerned, we should pay great attention to the Nanyang market and hope to maintain a considerable proportion in quantity. The authorities' previous prohibition of transporting cotton yarn to Nanyang was actually unfavorable to us. Finally, Mr. Xiao hoped that our country's industrial and commercial circles would work hard to improve manufacturing technology so that they could compete with Japan in the international market. Chinese talent has always been second to none, and it is also more convenient to obtain machines than Japan. Although there are currently "high wages" restrictions, costs can be reduced after the economic situation improves. If the government can also find ways to reduce the restrictions on the industrial and commercial circles, then foreign trade is not without a future.</p>
<p>Huang Yuanbin's Opinion</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's opinion is largely the same as Mr. Xiao's. He believes that our country adopts a managed trade policy, and the types and quantities of imported and exported goods are all stipulated. Only those that are allowed to be imported can be imported, and the quota cannot be exceeded. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about opening trade with Japan, because our country's trade policy will not suddenly change due to Japan's opening to foreign trade. The current situation is very different from before the war. Currently, our country's taxes are autonomous, so there is no need to worry too much about the past. Mr. Huang believes that the Nanyang market issue is more important than the Sino-Japanese trade issue, and said that the problem today lies in Nanyang, not in China. He pointed out that we have always attached great importance to Nanyang, but this depends on the extent of our efforts, because Nanyang is not our land, and the acquisition of its market depends on our efforts.</p>
<p>Zhu Xie's Speech</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanking, 20th] Zhu Xie, Deputy Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and a member of the business inspection delegation to Japan, said regarding the opening of Japan's foreign trade: From a general point of view, this measure of the Allied Headquarters is to exchange what one has for what one needs and reduce the burden on the occupying forces, so it is not unreasonable in principle, but if it is considered in light of the facts, the measures decided by the Allied Headquarters are too unfair. First, the U.S. dollar is used as the currency for transactions, and second, the export of luxury goods is the main focus, which is extremely unfavorable to us. He meant that it is okay to open trade with Japan, but the measures of the Allied Headquarters must be thoroughly revised, otherwise, who would be willing to do a business that benefits only one side?</p>
<h3>Employees of the Changyuan Levee Restoration Form a Suicide Squad to Rush the Repairs: Working at the Risk of Death Under the Encirclement and Attack of Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] The work of restoring the levees in the Changyuan area by the Hebei Repair and Defense Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is extremely difficult due to the attacks and disturbances by Zhang An, the pseudo-Magistrate of Dongyuan County, and Cao Mazi, the pseudo-District Chief. Of the more than fifty team leaders, including Su Yushan, who were abducted by the Communist bandits a few days ago, twenty-six have returned to work, while the whereabouts of the rest are still unknown. Most of the employees stationed on the levee are currently disguised and lurking in wheat gauze tents beside the levee. As soon as the Communist bandits leave slightly, they continue to work. To encourage employees to rush to repair the danger, three volunteer suicide squads have been specially organized to carry out the repair work at the risk of death.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] Wang Guorui, Chief of the Second and Third Engineering Sections of the Qinhe River Repair and Defense Office of Henan, arrived in Zhengzhou on the 17th evening from the north of the Yellow River. According to him: The Communist bandits attacked Heledian, which belongs to Wuzhi, on the afternoon of the 16th. Two-thirds of the seventy-odd employees of the engineering section have fled to Miaogong Village, east of Wuzhi County and west of the Pinghan Road, near the north bank. The whereabouts of the remaining personnel are currently unknown. The levee sections at Donghongqiao and Wuchekou on the south bank of the Yunhe River west of Wuzhi are extremely fragile and need to be repaired urgently because they were breached before. The banks and defenses of Zhuyuan Village and Muleidian east of Wuche must also be built, but the village of Donghongqiao is under the control of the Communist bandits, making construction very difficult. Now Muleidian has been attacked again, and the project cannot be carried out. If a major flood comes, and the levee body of Muleidian is breached, the Pinghan Road will be seriously threatened.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] According to news from the Shandong Repair and Defense Office: (1) Three teams of the Zhukou Engineering Team of the Yellow River's south bank levee repair project have temporarily withdrawn to Gaocun. Because Liuzhuang and Gaoling were invaded by the Communist army, they retreated to Maodian on the 18th and planned to rush to repair the dangerous works there. (2) Five teams of the Linpu Engineering Team are temporarily concentrated in Xingji and have contacted the Henan Repair and Defense Office to rush to repair dangerous works there. (3) The staff of the western office of Luxi and Linpu have all withdrawn to Kaifeng. (4) The materials and engineering team equipment stored in the Linpu section have all been looted by the Communist bandits and transported to the north bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<h3>Continued Breaches in Various Rivers in Southern Liaoning: Water Conservancy Bureau Sends Personnel for Survey</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 20th] It is raining again in southern Liaoning, and the rivers continue to breach, increasingly destroying rural fields.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] After the Liao River flooded and caused disaster, the area within twenty li of Yingkou has become a swamp. Haicheng is the most severely affected and widespread disaster area, with the affected area accounting for about six-tenths of the county's area. The Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau has sent four groups of personnel to conduct on-the-spot surveys, one group heading east to the Bohai River and the Taizi River, one group heading west to the Raoyang River and the Liao River, one group heading to the central part of the Liao River and the Sanjiangkou, and one group heading south to Yingkou Zhishan and other places. In addition, the water level of the Songhua River in the north is also rising, but the situation is not as serious as that of the Liao River.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses to Rong City's Flood-Affected Manufacturers: Statistics Reach 25 Billion, 100,000 Farmers in Western Sichuan Homeless</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 20th] The industrial sector has suffered the most severe losses after the flood here and is now facing a total collapse crisis. The Western Sichuan Industrial Association released statistics on the 20th, stating that the assets of public and private manufacturers throughout the city have lost 25 billion, with the Xin Xin, Yuhua, and Baoxing yarn factories being the most severely affected. Xin Xin No. 4 Factory was completely destroyed, losing more than 6 billion, and all work has been suspended. The association telegraphed the Four Joint Banks on the 20th, requesting an emergency loan of 10 billion to help resume work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 20th] After the flood in western Sichuan, more than 100,000 farmers were homeless. For the sake of relief, the provincial government specially allocated 3 billion in agricultural loans for emergency relief on the 20th in conjunction with the Rong City Farmers Bank.

<h3>Editorial: The Question of Japan's Opening to Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>According to a statement from General MacArthur's headquarters, Japan's private foreign trade will be opened starting August 15th. Our government has yet to express its attitude on this matter. At the State Council meeting on the 18th of this month, Foreign Minister Wang's report on the Japanese peace treaty issue did not mention the opening of Japanese trade. Business circles in Tianjin and Shanghai have been feeling uneasy for days, believing that opening Japan's foreign trade at this time would be more harmful than beneficial to our country. Supervisory Committee member Wan Can and others, seeing the seriousness of the situation, have loudly appealed to the government to stop considering opening trade with Japan and to suspend sending a business delegation to Japan. This appeal has attracted attention from all sides. August 15th is approaching in the blink of an eye. We not only cannot stand idly by regarding the development of this matter, but should also pay close attention to it and further devise appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>The opening of Japan's private trade was jointly announced by the U.S. State Department and the Department of the Army on June 8th. General MacArthur further announced this plan in detail the following day. According to MacArthur's statement, private foreign trade with Japan will be partially restored from August 15th. After that date, Allied and neutral country merchants will be allowed to enter Japan, limited to 400 people. The so-called preliminary restoration of international trade on August 15th does not mean a complete restoration of free international trade. All commercial negotiations will be mediated by the Allied Headquarters and guided by its International Trade Group. Regarding the 400 trade merchants, according to the resolution passed on July 3rd by the Trade Association with Japan under the Far Eastern Commission, the 400 people include 102 from the United States, 60 each from China and the United Kingdom, 39 from India, 27 from the Netherlands and Indonesia, 23 from Australia, 16 from France and Vietnam, 8 from Canada, 6 from New Zealand and the Philippines, and none from the Soviet Union. The United Kingdom, the Philippines, Australia, and India did not feel interested in this decision. The Australian government firmly stated that Australia would not restore private trade with Japan before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Australia's attitude is quite clear, has foresight, and has a method. We wholeheartedly resonate with it.</p>
<p>Japan's domestic business community is not only celebrating and congratulating the United States for this "significant," "wise" "decision," but also expressing "gratitude." They are looking forward to the "old days" of 1934, and are witnessing China's disappointing current situation. For months, they have been overjoyed, formulating various trade plans, especially for exports to China, deciding on a huge surplus of more than 51.6 million US dollars, including exports: (1) Machinery: 30,000 bicycles, 40,000 air cylinders, 100,000 watches, 100,000 cameras, 500 motors, 30,000 spindles of textile machinery, as well as locomotives and agricultural tools; (2) Fiber: 175,000 boxes of silkworm seed paper, 9,800 bales of rayon, as well as pottery, paper, wood, and glass; (3) Agricultural products: miscellaneous grains, aquatic products such as shark fins, sea cucumbers, and abalone, all totaling 4,964.365 thousand yen, equivalent to 99.28 million US dollars. As for imports, the goods purchased from us include 600,000 metric tons of salt, 360,000 metric tons of sugar, 370,000 metric tons of soybeans, 900,000 metric tons of coal, 400,000 pounds of animal hair, 890,000 pounds of cork and licorice, 340,000 pounds of sea grass, and 60,000 pounds of beeswax, 30,000 pounds of茯苓, totaling 2,384.092 thousand yen, equivalent to 47.6 million US dollars. Comparing the two values, the trade surplus to China is 51.68 million US dollars. Thus, the so-called restoration of private trade with Japan is simply the restoration of her pre-war supermarket in China.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content of this Japanese trade plan further, it is obviously extremely unfavorable to our country. First, the trade is based on US dollars. Does our country have that much foreign exchange? Moreover, our country's foreign exchange is controlled by the government. How can private trade be discussed? Second, most of the goods Japan imports into our country are inferior, and many industrial products are pouring in, which may destroy our national industrial production. The future is truly unimaginable. Third, what Japan needs are all our country's industrial raw materials or daily necessities for the people. At present, there is unrest in our country, and disasters are everywhere. We are already facing a shortage of materials ourselves. How can we supply Japan's huge needs? In particular, the current cost of our country's export materials is very high. If trade is restored and MacArthur's headquarters does not calculate according to the actual cost, our country's business community will inevitably suffer huge losses. All of this is possible. In short, from the perspective of trade itself, the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade is more harmful than beneficial to our country, and the associated technical difficulties are numerous. We have very few reasons to explain why our country needs the restoration of trade with Japan at this stage. Looking further ahead, the remnants of Japanese militarism have not been completely eliminated. If she is allowed to continue to play an important role in the Far Eastern economic circle, not only will the Southeast Asian market gradually restore its monopoly, but the result will inevitably threaten the entire world and ancient peace. Is it only China that will be affected?</p>
<p>Standing from the position of the Chinese people and the position of safeguarding world peace, we agree with the attitude of the Australian government. We believe that China does not need to open trade with Japan before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan and the settlement of the reparations issue. Only after the reparations issue is resolved and the peace treaty is signed can private trade between China and Japan be restored!</p>
<h3>Political Assassination in Burma</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, a shocking political assassination suddenly occurred in Burma. Because traffic between Rangoon and the outside world was completely interrupted, the details of the incident have not yet been reported in detail. However, according to an announcement by the British Burma Office, in addition to the death of Burmese Interim Government Deputy Chairman Aung San on the spot, six other ministers also died at the same time. The news spread to the capitals of various countries, and all were shocked, not only expressing regret for Burma's loss of a political leader, but also expressing concern about the future of Burma's political situation.</p>
<p>After World War II, Burma was refined by nationalism and激盪by the world's trend, demanding independence and autonomy, which is sympathetic to anyone. Aung San led the Burmese people to achieve the goal of Burmese independence through peaceful means and negotiations, which is also admired by the world. In January of this year, Aung San led a delegation to London to negotiate with the British authorities and put forward three demands: (1) Britain declares Burmese independence; (2) Organize a Burmese national government; (3) Hold universal suffrage and convene a constitutional assembly. After a long negotiation, the Anglo-Burmese Agreement was signed. After returning to the country, Aung San actively carried out universal suffrage. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League he led won an unprecedented victory. The Constitutional Assembly has been in session since it was established in April, and has begun its constitutional work there.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the Anglo-Burmese Agreement failed to immediately establish Burma, which aroused the dissatisfaction of some people, especially the radical Communist Party, which not only formed its own Red Flag Army, but also colluded with the 100,000 "Revolutionary Army" of the First Alliance for Burmese Independence, attempting to riot in the country. Observers have long been worried about Burma. Therefore, although we do not know the details of this political assassination, we can see from the trajectory of the development of the Burmese political situation that the occurrence of this incident is only a superficial manifestation of the struggle between the two major parties in Burma.</p>
<p>Post-war Burma has suffered great trauma. Whether it is to achieve immediate independence or to go through a transitional period of self-governing territory, what the Burmese people urgently need at present is domestic stability. Only in stability can progress be achieved. Therefore, the occurrence of this terrorist assassination, in any case, is harmful and unhelpful to the future of Burma.</p>

<h3>Coup Erupts, Seven Cabinet Members Die Tragically; Former Burmese Prime Minister Arrested; New Cabinet of Thakin Nu Sworn In</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 20th] The new Administrative Committee led by Thakin Nu, Speaker of the Burmese Constituent Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, was sworn in today. All six members are members of the Anti-Fascist League and survived yesterday's assassination attempt. The situation in Rangoon is calm today and is under the complete control of the authorities. Government offices are operating as usual, and public sentiment is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 20th] Unofficial reports indicate that more than 80 suspects have been arrested in connection with the assassination of Burmese government leaders. At the same time, Meng Pang, the Regional Counselor of the Burmese Administrative Committee who was injured in yesterday's attack, died of his injuries this morning, bringing the total number of deaths to seven, with one injured.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] The Burmese Office reported on the 20th that two hours after the assassination of Burmese Interim Government Prime Minister Aung San and five cabinet members, former Prime Minister U Saw, leader of the Myochit Party (National Party), and 19 members of his party had been subjected to "protective detention." It is reported that British police officers engaged in a gun battle with U Saw's men before storming his residence. Three of U Saw's subordinates were shot and killed. Police officers found many rifles and submachine guns in U Saw's residence. Burmese sources here are divided on whether U Saw or the Communist Party was responsible for the attack. Those who believe that the Communist Party committed the crime point out that Aung San declared most of the Burmese Communist Party an illegal organization in June. On the other hand, U Saw, who leads the extremist nationalist faction, advocates complete independence from Britain and therefore strongly opposes Aung San.</p>
<h3>The Course of Political Assassination in Burma</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] During a routine meeting of the Burmese Administrative Council (Burma's interim government) at the Rangoon government office today, a group of thugs broke in and opened fire with submachine guns, killing six Burmese government leaders and wounding two others on the spot. News of the assassination was telegraphed to the Burma Office in London tonight by the Governor of Burma, Sir Rance. Communications to and from Rangoon were cut off for several hours after the incident. The Governor's report stated, "As the Administrative Council was in session, a jeep drove to the front gate of the government office. Five men jumped out, armed with several submachine guns and two rifles, and rushed upstairs to the conference hall. One person remained on guard in the jeep. A guard with a gun outside the conference room tried to stop them but was severely wounded by the thugs and unable to speak. Three of the men with submachine guns entered the room and opened fire on the leaders present, then returned to the jeep and fled. The deceased were identified as Vice-Chairman of the Administrative Council, Aung San; Minister of Commerce and Supply, Ba Win; Minister of Education and Design, Ba Saik; Minister of Industry and Labor, Mahn Ba Khaing; Minister of Finance, Thakin Mya; and Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications, Ohn Maung. The wounded were identified as Minister of Information, Ba Cho; and Frontier Councilor, the chief of Mahn Gon area. The dead and wounded have been rushed to the General Hospital. The situation is being handled by the police. So far, there have been no reports that the police have fully controlled the situation. Further details will follow." The identity of the perpetrators is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Note: The Burmese interim government is composed of fourteen members, mostly from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League led by Aung San. Aung San is a prominent leader in Burma. In January of this year, he led the now-deceased Thakin Mya, Ba Pe, who had already left the government, and Tin Tut, who maintained an independent stance, to London to sign an agreement with the British government to establish a self-governing government in Burma. Tin Tut is now in London and has been appointed as Burma's High Commissioner to the UK. The Burmese delegation at the time also included the leader of the Dobama Asiayone party, U Saw, and the leader of the Sinheba Wunthanu party, Thakin Ba Sein, who refused to sign the agreement. Upon returning from London, U Saw and the other leader declared their opposition to the agreement and withdrew from the government. In recent months, the Burmese Administrative Council has enjoyed full cabinet powers. The Burmese Constitutional Assembly is drafting the constitution for the self-governing government and recently passed a resolution declaring Burma's independence from the British Commonwealth. The majority of the assembly members are from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. The Speaker of the Assembly, Thakin Nu, is Aung San's right-hand man, and is denounced by the Communist Party as "a tool of British imperialism" and "a traitor to the working class." The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League is a coalition of ten parties, and in May 1945, it announced that it had 100,000 members. Its military forces fought alongside the British army against the Japanese and were called the Burma National Army. Initially, the ten parties included the Communist Party, but after the Communist Party's newspaper attacked the League's policies and refused to apologize, the League's Supreme Council decided on November 3, 1946, to expel the Communist Party from the League. The League's other parties are the People's Revolutionary Party, the Dobama Asiayone Party (Nationalist Party), the Burma Fabian Society, the Thakinwun Party, the Burma Youth League, the Greater Burma Party, the Sanghas Association, the Women's Freedom League, and the Burma National Army. Governor Rance broadcast tonight, announcing that he has appointed Constitutional Assembly Speaker Thakin Nu to establish a new Administrative Council. Thakin Nu's position in Burma is second only to Aung San. The Governor also condemned the violence and urged the Burmese people to remain calm and follow the path to independence laid out by their leaders.</p>
<p>The King's Condolences</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The King and the government have sent telegrams expressing their sympathy to the Burmese government officials who were killed. Prime Minister Attlee, Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma Henderson, and Secretary of State for Burma Lord Listowel have all sent telegrams to the Speaker of the Burmese Constitutional Assembly, Thakin Nu. Attlee also sent a telegram to Aung San's wife. The King sent a telegram to the Governor of Burma, Rance, expressing his deep grief, recalling the pleasant meetings he had with Aung San and Thakin Mya in London in January, and asking him to convey his condolences to the families of the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery. The British government's telegram stated that it was deeply shocked and expressed its sincere sympathy to the Burmese government and the families of the victims. Aung San's death has deprived Burma of one of its greatest leaders and public servants. The British government also hopes for the speedy recovery of the injured.</p>
<p>British and American Attention</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] "The New York Times" and "The Herald Tribune" both published the news of the assassination of Burmese Prime Minister Aung San and his five ministers on their front pages. Reports from London indicated that the communists were responsible for the assassination. At the same time, the two newspapers also prominently published the news of the assassination of Lyuh Woon-hyung, who once served as the Deputy Foreign Minister of the Korean Provisional Government in exile in China. Lyuh was considered a prominent non-communist leftist figure in Korea. The newspapers stated that the Communist Party was also suspected of the murder in this case, as Lyuh had strongly opposed communist control and had faced strong opposition from extremist elements among his colleagues.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Burmese political circles here say they believe that the assassination of Aung San and five other cabinet members was carried out by the Burmese Communist Party, as Aung San had recently declared most communist organizations illegal. In addition to the communists, Aung San's political opponents also opposed his liberal policies. These extremist nationalists opposed Aung San's recent concessions to British demands.</p>
<p>Aung San's Brief Biography</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Aung San, the Vice-Chairman of the Burmese interim government who was assassinated yesterday, was 32 years old and a powerful figure in Burma. The Burmese people praised him for liberating Burma twice. In 1942, he helped the Japanese in their war. Later, realizing the Japanese plot, he turned to help the British fight against the Japanese and became an anti-Japanese leader. He enrolled at Rangoon University in 1933 and became the President of the Rangoon University Students' Union in 1936, leading a nationwide strike movement. Last year, he launched a nationwide strike against the British military occupation of Burma. The Burmese government had no choice but to compromise with him and reorganize the Administrative Council. The Communist Party therefore denounced him as a tool of British imperialism.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Mandated Islands, US Military Government Ends</h3>
<p>US Announces Provisional Trusteeship Measures</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] White House announced today: President Truman has signed the trusteeship agreement, by which the United States manages the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific, and has appointed General Denfeld as the temporary administrator. Denfeld is the Commander of the US Pacific Fleet and will administer the islands as High Commissioner, pending the takeover by government civil administration agencies. The trusteeship agreement was adopted by the United Nations Security Council in April of this year and subsequently approved by Congress. In addition to signing the agreement, President Truman issued an order prescribing provisional management measures for the trust territory. This management began on the 18th of this month, the date the President signed the joint resolution of both houses. The trust territory consists of the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, all of which were seized by the United States from Japan in the later stages of the war. The President's order authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to implement temporary management while stipulating that the power "to close any area for security reasons" granted to the United States in the trusteeship agreement shall be exercised jointly by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of State. In addition, the order stipulates that the Secretary of State shall oversee all relations between federal agencies and corresponding agencies of the United Nations regarding the trust territory. The military government in the trust territory has been declared terminated by order. According to the agreement, the United States must enact laws to implement the prescribed programs. President Truman stated that he has instructed the State Department to compile legislative recommendations, which are expected to be submitted when the next Congress convenes.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Situation, Cloudy but No Rain; Indonesia Asks to Reopen Peace Talks; Nehru Expresses Resolve to Support Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian government sent a letter to the Dutch Commission in Indonesia today, asking them to meet with Indonesia to peacefully resolve the outstanding issues, or to agree to appoint a chairman from a third country (to be selected from the consuls-general of China, Britain, the United States, and France stationed in Batavia) to arbitrate the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The Republic of Indonesia today also asked India to prepare a memorandum to submit to the United Nations Security Council, based on the grounds that the Indonesian situation threatens world peace. Reports from Yogyakarta said that Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian interim government, has stated that he will personally support the policy of the Indonesian government to maintain the de facto status of the Republic. Republican officials believe that India will strongly support Indonesia in the event of a war between the Netherlands and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Mediation by Various Countries Fails</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] Efforts by Britain and other allied countries to mediate and get the Indonesian authorities to issue a ceasefire order before noon today have failed. The Indonesian Prime Minister called from Yogyakarta, saying that his cabinet could not reach a resolution as scheduled because Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit, who was traveling by train from Batavia to Yogyakarta with the Dutch proposals, had not yet arrived by 11 a.m. this morning. A Republican spokesman blamed the Dutch for not providing an airplane for Setyadjit to travel on, causing the delay.</p>
<p>Dutch Deny Launching War</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Dutch-Indonesian government has stated that the Dutch have no military intentions and refused to discuss the possibility of war. A spokesman for the Dutch-Indonesian government acknowledged that Governor-General Van Mook had received a reply from The Hague, but pointed out that this did not mean that Van Mook was able to order military action. Another Dutch spokesman strongly denied reports that the Dutch government had ordered Van Mook to take military action, and that Van Mook had replied that he did not intend to launch it before Tuesday.</p>
<p>Indonesia Appeals for International Intervention</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian Republican government decided last night to urgently appeal to Britain, India, Australia, and the Arab League to intervene to prevent a war between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Indonesian government has instructed its representatives in New Delhi, Singapore, and Canberra to submit the aforementioned requests to Nehru, the British Special Envoy to Southeast Asia, Killearn, and the Australian Foreign Minister, Evatt. At the same time, Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir said in Yogyakarta that he felt that the Dutch attitude had made it impossible for Indonesia to reconsider its position. He was especially disappointed that there was no response from the Dutch to his broadcast calling for a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Dutch Military Commander Suddenly Resigns</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] According to newspaper reports, Lieutenant General Spoor, the Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch forces in the Dutch East Indies, has resigned to the Dutch government because "the military situation in the Dutch East Indies has become unbearable," but the government has retained him.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 20th] Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister Tamzil said here today: The Netherlands wants war. I firmly believe that they will soon attack the Republic of Indonesia. It is puzzling that the Netherlands is willing to bear the burden of a colonial war when it is in such a difficult situation. Indonesia still hopes that the current dispute can be resolved peacefully. We have accepted four-fifths of the Dutch proposals. It is unreasonable to say that the remaining one-fifth, which concerns the issue of organizing a joint Dutch-Indonesian police force, is sufficient justification for attacking Indonesia. When asked about Indonesia's resistance capabilities, Tamzil said that Indonesia has a total of 250,000 soldiers, but they cannot effectively resist a large-scale Dutch offensive in an organized manner. The Dutch army is well-equipped, and Indonesia has no choice but to adopt a scorched earth policy.</p>
<h3>International Telecommunications Conference, Outer Mongolia Not Allowed to Participate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] At the plenary session of the International Telecommunications Conference held in Atlantic City yesterday, a vote was held to oppose the admission of Outer Mongolia as a member state. Thus, Outer Mongolia has not been able to gain international recognition as an independent republic. Yesterday's vote was 32 to 26 against Outer Mongolia's admission, with nine countries abstaining. At the same time, the conference voted 46 to 45 against the admission of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, with ten countries abstaining. The conference stipulated that a country applying for membership must obtain a two-thirds majority vote for approval. The Soviet Union supported the admission of the three Baltic states and Outer Mongolia. The conference took this action based on the recommendation of the Credentials Committee, which originally recommended that Outer Mongolia be allowed to attend the conference, but Spain and the three Baltic states should not be allowed to participate.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Atlantic City, 19th] At today's plenary session of the International Telecommunications Conference, a vote of 36 to 21 rejected Spain's application for membership.</p>
<h3>Bevin Explains British Policy, Says Britain is Planting Seeds of Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Amble, Northumberland, England, 19th] Foreign Secretary Bevin addressed 50,000 miners and their families here today, believing that there is no danger of another war in this generation.</p>
<p>He said: "I sincerely believe that the differences of opinion and suspicions between us and the Soviet Union can eventually be eliminated. We must find ways to unite the United States and the Soviet Union to work together to save all of humanity. Britain is now striving to plant the seeds of peace, and everything depends on the will of the people. Although the British government has a clear reputation, it is facing a difficult task internationally. As Foreign Secretary, I am always fully aware that a wrong decision or judgment, or even a willful response, will not only harm this generation, but will also harm children 30 or 40 years later. However, as far as I can see, there is no danger of another war in this generation. I am not discouraged by the difficulties of the past." Bevin continued: "It has been said that I intend to use Marshall's proposal to rebuild Germany, which is not the case. Germany's recovery must be achieved through the general recovery of the European economy. Although a standard must be established and maintained during this process, there are two things that affect us all: how security can be ensured, and what level of German industrial production should be allowed to maintain to prevent German workers from being arbitrarily exploited by unscrupulous people, thereby lowering the living standards of the European people. We must prevent the exploitation of the European people or the lowering of European living standards. This balance must be maintained. We know that the Ruhr coal mines are the basis for the restoration of prosperity in Europe. At a time when coal is scarce, we should restore normal production in the Ruhr coal mines. France has said: The Ruhr is the source of Germany's military power, how can the Ruhr be rebuilt? France asked with horror: Will rebuilding the Ruhr subject our country to a third attack? We, the British people, must also pay attention to our country's security. We must never face an aggressive Germany again, and we must never allow Germany to become aggressive again. In this, we hope that the United States will never withdraw from Europe." Bevin then told the miners: If you can supply France with British coal, you can rebuild the French economy. During the war, the French economy was adapted to the German economy. After the war, France has not been able to restore its old foundation. One of the reasons is that Britain has not been able to supply France with coal. Finally, he said that it is necessary to break the vicious cycle that binds the world so that the economy can get on the right track. He also hoped that he would not have to borrow money from the United States again, as this is unnatural for both the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>Bevin May Resign as Foreign Secretary to Handle British Labor Issues</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] This week's "World News" weekly reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin may resign as Foreign Secretary and be responsible for handling Britain's labor issues. Bevin handled foreign labor issues during the war, and now that he is resuming this position, he can achieve familiar results. However, Bevin's firm decision will be made after a resolution on the Marshall Plan for European aid is established.</p>
<h3>British and American Economists Observe, Japan Will Fall Into the Arms of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] Economists from allied countries, especially Britain and the United States, are deeply concerned that Japan, after obtaining a peace treaty, will become the Yugoslavia of the East, first economically leaning towards the Soviet Union, and then politically falling into the arms of the Soviet Union. They expect that after Japan opens up to foreign trade, manufacturers in Western countries will not welcome Japanese goods competing with them, while the Soviet Union can absorb everything that Japan can produce, which will result in Japan's trade automatically leaning towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Looking at pre-war figures, between 1934 and 1936, exports absorbed by East Asia (China, Korea, Taiwan) accounted for 43 percent of Japan's annual exports, and all of Asia, including East Asia, accounted for 64 percent. Asian exports to Japan accounted for 53 percent of Japan's total imports. The United States absorbed only 16 percent of Japan's exports and accounted for only 24 percent of Japan's imports. Raw silk was originally Japan's main export, but since the emergence of rayon and nylon fibers, the United States has not been very interested in Japanese raw silk. As for the Japanese textile industry, it once dominated the world market before the war, but according to Japanese manufacturers' estimates, it will take at least ten years to restore it to the level of 1936-37. By then, India and China will have become strong rivals. Japan's only hope is now pinned on its machinery industry. Korea and China, major customers of Japan before the war, still need Japanese machinery to revive their industries, as well as cheap Japanese goods to supply their large populations. Today, Japan needs food, oil, and cotton, all of which come from the United States. However, it is expected that after the occupation ends, MacArthur withdraws from Japan, and international trade finds its level, the food, cotton, and oil that Japan needs will pour in from the Soviet Union, just across the sea. And Japanese goods will not be difficult to find sales channels in the Soviet Union, so Japan will eventually fall into the Soviet Union's economic sphere of influence.</p>
<h3>MacArthur May Participate in the Next Presidential Election</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] The issue of General MacArthur participating in the presidential election is still being discussed in political circles. It is said that since the Civil War, there have been five military personnel in the United States who have served as president. Although General Eisenhower has repeatedly denied it, observers believe that Eisenhower has a strong intention to be elected president. In addition to Eisenhower, MacArthur also seems to have signs of participating in the 1948 presidential election. If a peace treaty with Japan is concluded, MacArthur's prestige will inevitably increase, and he will return to the United States amid cheers. It is expected that MacArthur's return will be around March next year.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Simultaneous Announcements, Indian Interim Government Reorganized, Exercising Full Powers Until the Two Dominions are Established</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British and Indian governments simultaneously issued a statement in London and New Delhi today stating that the Governor-General of India, Lord Mountbatten, with the consent of the leaders of various political parties in India, has decided to establish an Indian interim government, composed of representatives from Pakistan and Hindustan, which will constitute future governments. This interim government will exercise its powers until August 15, when the two Dominions of Pakistan and Hindustan will declare independence. According to sources here, the newly established interim government will enable Governor-General Mountbatten to act more easily due to the cooperation of the future heads of the two Dominion governments, and will facilitate the separation of the two sides on August 15.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th] The Indian interim government is reorganized into two committees, representing the governments of India and Pakistan. The two committees will separately discuss matters related to the territory of each government; joint matters between the two governments will be decided by the Governor-General as chairman. The two committees are the two interim governments, and the distribution of their ministers is as follows: For India, Nehru will be in charge of Foreign Affairs, Relations with the British Commonwealth and the United Nations, and Legislation; Patel will be in charge of Home Affairs, Propaganda, and Broadcasting; Prasad will be in charge of Food and Agriculture; Azad will be in charge of Education; Chari will be in charge of Industrial Supplies and Finance; Dr. Matthai will be in charge of Transport, Railways, and Communications; Singh will be in charge of National Defense; Bhabha will be in charge of Mines, Electricity, and Commerce; and Ram will be in charge of Labor and Health. On the Pakistan side, Ali Khan will be in charge of Finance, Foreign Affairs, and National Defense; Chundrigar will be in charge of Commerce, Industry and Supplies, Mines, and Electricity; Nishtar will be in charge of Communications, Railways, Transport, and Propaganda Broadcasting; Ali Khan will be in charge of Health, Food, and Home Affairs; and Mandal will be in charge of Legislation, Education, and Labor.</p>
<h3>Indian National Congress Adopts the Tricolor Flag</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 19th] A unanimous demand for independence and total opposition to Britain has become the party soul of the National Congress under the tricolor flag. All nationalists with different hopes in society and economics have now gathered in the united All-India National Congress. How to use the power of these nationalists to build a modern India is the immediate task. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the National Congress, at today's meeting, will discuss, among several important issues, plans for how to establish and reform India's political, cultural, and social life. It is reported that this plan will include recommendations for modernizing India's national defense and rapidly industrializing India. Regarding the issue of the Indian national flag, it was decided to adopt the tricolor flag of the National Congress (orange-yellow, white, and green), but to replace the spinning wheel in the center of the National Congress party flag with a deep blue wheel. It is generally believed that this change symbolizes the replacement of Gandhi's past ideals of a rural economy with rapid industrialization.</p>
<h3>Connally Expresses Opposition to Expanding the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, a Democratic foreign policy expert and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, broadcast an address tonight, opposing the expansion of the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Asia. Connally expressed great skepticism about the success of the Paris Sixteen Nation Conference discussing the Marshall Plan. He said: "I have great doubts as to whether European countries can fully cooperate to implement a joint plan. I have not yet determined whether any future plan is the best and most effective plan to deal with the current situation." Connally also urged European countries to exert the maximum amount of effort for self-help. He believes that Europe must work hard to save itself, and then the United States will be able to easily decide what action to take. Connally also solemnly warned against implementing relief plans that are too costly.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Disagreement on the Ruhr Coal Issue: Each Side Contends Based on Their National Interests; Britain Seeks French Support</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Sources familiar with the matter here have stated that Britain and the United States are currently engaged in a friendly but vigorous struggle over the Ruhr region issue. According to official sources, the differing stances of the two countries are as follows: (1) The United States believes that the Ruhr region is key to Europe's recovery and should therefore be given priority. This necessitates the supervision of coal production in the region by American technical personnel, as the United States believes that the efforts of British technical personnel in the region have been unsuccessful. Once the coal issue is resolved, the United States will begin to increase Germany's steel production, at least to restore it to pre-war levels. Some argue that this move will jeopardize security, but the United States does not believe so, as centralization would facilitate control, and in the event of any mishap, atomic weapons could obliterate everything overnight. (2) Britain also hopes to revive the German economy so that the British occupation zone will no longer be a burden on British taxpayers, but Britain does not agree with the ultimate goals suggested by the United States or the methods it advocates. Britain does not believe that its technical personnel are less capable than those of the United States, and it is unwilling to lose control over Ruhr production. Therefore, Britain has refused to participate in the two-nation coal conference in Washington. Britain believes that the ultimate goals proposed by the United States are politically dangerous and contrary to the ideals of all of Germany's neighbors, and therefore opposes them. It should be known that the current plan of the United States is tantamount to risking German competition and endangering the industries of Britain and France. In order to counter the United States, Britain is now seeking the support of France (which has already indicated its support) and British miners.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] The French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, today reiterated to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett France's opposition to the Anglo-American plan to raise Germany's industrial level.</p>
<h3>Soviet Reparation Demands on Germany; The US Does Not Plan to Consider Them Currently</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 20th] General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Germany, said today that the U.S. military government in Germany will not consider Soviet reparation demands until the new treaty on German industrial production is implemented.

<h3>European Economic Cooperation Committee: The Content of the Memorandum is Approved; Includes Twelve Points to be Submitted to Member States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] On the 18th, the Sixteen-Nation European Economic Cooperation Committee unanimously decided to send the terms of a basic economic memorandum to member states, requesting the submission of actionable facts and figures. After three days of discussion, the twelve points of the agreement reached on the night of the 19th are intended to provide the Cooperation Committee with all the basic knowledge it needs to draft a complete European recovery plan.

(9) The extent to which existing productive capacity can be utilized. (10) Principles to be followed in answering the memorandum. (11) Procedures to be followed in submitting replies. (12) Possible assistance from colonies. The Cooperation Committee will conclude its work on September 1st.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Launches Psychological Warfare; The US Responds with Facts; US Senator Hatch Declares</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] U.S. Senator Hatch, a member of the Democratic Party, stated in a broadcast speech on "Our Country's Foreign Policy" tonight that the United States must respond to the psychological warfare launched by the Soviet Union with concrete facts. If a suitable recovery plan is laid for Europe, the United States should not spare its efforts to aid Europe. This will entail significant sacrifices for the United States, one of which is that our government may need considerable economic management during this aid period. Some say that the United States has economic imperialistic ambitions, which is not true. The sacrifices we will endure will be irreplaceable by anyone. It should be known that the United States only asks other countries to accept democratic principles and protect individual freedoms. Therefore, if they achieve economic recovery, it will be due to the aid of the United States, and they should faithfully abide by the principles of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Attempt to Form a Separate Government; The Situation in Greece Worsens; The U.S. Congress Will Immediately Allocate Funds to Aid Greece and Turkey</h3>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 20th] The Greek Ministry of the Army issued a communique today, strongly asserting that the "International Legion" participated in the recent invasion of Greece from Albania. The newspaper report yesterday that the Ministry of the Army denied the existence of this army was actually a misunderstanding that no such international elements had been captured.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] A United Nations investigation team today entered the northwestern border of Greece to conduct an on-site investigation of Greece's accusation that the "International Legion" invaded from Albania. The team has reported this action to the United Nations headquarters, and the Security Council will adjourn until the second week of next month to reconvene to discuss the Balkan issue. At that time, the United States will force a showdown with the Soviet Union on the issue of establishing a monitoring group on the northern border of Greece.</p>
<p>The US Decides to Assist in the Recovery of Greece</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 19th] The Athens News Agency reported that when the head of the U.S. delegation to Greece, Griswold, was asked at a press conference whether the delegation had a plan to improve the situation in Greece, he replied that the U.S. delegation included both an economic mission and a military mission for this purpose. When asked whether the recovery plan could be implemented while the guerrillas continued to operate, Griswold said that recovery work should be carried out as far as possible in areas where it could be implemented. A communist reporter asked what the U.S. government's attitude would be if the guerrillas established a government in the mountains. He replied that this matter would be decided by Washington, but he did not expect the government to recognize it. Griswold added that the mission was scheduled to last for one year, and he hoped that U.S. military equipment could be transferred to the Greek army immediately. The mission would immediately begin repairing bridges and roads, and restoring industry, commerce, agriculture, and sanitation. He also stated that the U.S. mission was not political in nature and would only engage in recovery tasks.</p>

The compromise plan will be presented to the Constituent Assembly on Wednesday and is likely to be approved by a parliamentary majority, as the opposition's argument is only that the treaty should not take effect before the Soviet Union approves it.</p>
<h3>Economic and Social Council Discusses Rules of Procedure;</h3>
<p>Poor Attendance, Pessimistic Outlook</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations Economic and Social Council held its fifth session this morning. In addition to several representatives delivering pious hopes and encouraging speeches, the Council also approved the agenda proposed by its Rules of Procedure Committee (which includes a total of thirty-nine clauses).

<h3>German Secret Documents Released: The Anti-Nazi Uprising Failed; 5,000 People Were Brutally Killed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The British Admiralty today released German secret documents for the third time, revealing that nearly 5,000 Germans were killed by Hitler after the failed assassination attempt on Hitler with a bomb in July 1944. The Admiralty said that this was a genuine uprising of the German people against the Nazis, but much of the evidence was destroyed by the Nazis afterwards. Propaganda Minister Goebbels even made this widespread uprising be regarded as a dangerous and limited rebellion. People inside Germany at that time had already recognized that defeat was inevitable, so many officials of Stauffenberg's faction planned to assassinate Hitler with a bomb. After achieving their goal, they planned to send General Wiesel to take over the German army, General Fromm, who commanded the domestic army, would be responsible for occupying Berlin, and then General Beck would be ordered to organize the government and sue for peace with the Allied countries. As a result, although the assassination was not successful, some parts of the plan were still implemented as usual. Although Fromm was arrested, the reserve army still marched towards Berlin, and Wiesel also issued an order and declaration to revolt before being arrested. The six months after the assassination were the most terrifying period of the Nazi slaughter of its own people, with about 5,000 people being killed without trial.</p>

In addition, the source of wealth of the post-war nouveau riche will also be investigated, and appropriate measures will be taken.</p>

<h3>A Rally to Boost Military Morale Was Held Yesterday; Donations Were Enthusiastically Made on the Spot; Shanghai Can Live Peacefully Thanks to the Soldiers at the Front; It is Hoped That Everyone Will Fulfill Their National Responsibility and Respond to Fundraising</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Municipal All Circles "Suppress Communist Bandits to Build the Nation" Ten Thousand Yuan Rally to Boost Military Morale was held at the Grand Theater at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The presidium consisted of Mayor Wu Guozhen, Party Chief Fang Xikong, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan (represented by Xiang Changquan), Division Camp Commander Chuan Zhengmo, Three Principles of the People Youth League Wu Shaoshu (represented by Cao Jun), Police Chief Yu Shuping, General Labor Union Shui Xiangyun, Chamber of Commerce Du Yuesheng (represented by Wang Xianqing), Farmers Association Hou Ren, Women's Association Tian Shujun, Social Bureau Wu Kaixian (represented by Li Jianhua), Industrial Association Wu Yunchu, Party Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Civil Affairs Office Zhang Xiaosong, Boy Scouts Council Deputy Director-General Fan Xiaoliu, and Legislative Member Hua Shengmo, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Xinjiang, and others. More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life attended the rally. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The rally began with the usual ceremonies, and the whole body silently prayed for three minutes for the soldiers at the front who died in the suppression of bandits.</p>
<p>Chairman Mayor Wu took his seat and delivered a speech stating that Shanghai people are busy with industrial and commercial affairs and are far away from the front line, so they may not have a deep sense of suppressing communist bandits and building the nation. But if we think about it carefully, why are Shanghai and the country's economic difficulties increasing day by day? The reason lies in the results of the Communist Party's treasonous rebellion, according to my year of experience in handling affairs, it can be proven that:</p>
<p>The Communist Party Disrupted the Country, Causing Food and Coal Shortages</p>
<p>(1) The food problem, the rising rice prices last year and this year, is due to insufficient production and supply, but how can it be insufficient? The Communist Party occupies Jiangbei. When it was defeated by the National Army, it robbed all the food, ate it all, and destroyed the farmland. The rice of the people in the Jiangbei area could have been self-sufficient, but later they had to purchase it from Wuxi and other places in Jiangnan, while Shanghai's rice supply was mainly supplied by Wuxi, Bengbu, and other places, now it can only supply a part, resulting in a rice shortage. (2) In terms of fuel, the Communist Party used water to bury the Shandong and Zhongxing coal mines, and killed technical personnel who had no political relations, trying to prevent production and disrupt the country. According to the report of the Zhongxing manager last winter, although the re-working machinery and equipment have been prepared, the coal mine dewatering work must be completed in March of this year, so during that period, coal became panic. As for other items such as cooking oil and cotton yarn, they cannot be transported south due to the Communist Party's destruction of production fields and transportation.</p>
<p>But in comparison, the people of Shanghai are extremely lucky and can still live and work in peace. This should be attributed to the soldiers at the front. The soldiers in Northeastern China repelled the Communist army in Sipingjie and prevented the soaring prices in Shanghai, which is a definite proof. Therefore, I hope that the four million citizens of Shanghai can take five minutes to think about whether they should respond to the fundraising to boost military morale and fulfill their responsibility as a national citizen.</p>
<p>We Must Achieve the Goal of 10 Billion in Military Morale Fundraising</p>
<p>Following this, Fang Shengwei delivered a speech stating that if we want to save China and make China peaceful and unified, we must first eliminate the Communist Party. Otherwise, the Communist Party will destroy China, and destroying China will destroy all the world's nations. If we stand by and watch today, we will be sitting and waiting for death in the future. Think about it, if the Communist Party comes to Shanghai, can we still live a peaceful life? The soldiers at the front are now bleeding for us. If we don't express anything, how can we be worthy of them? So we must achieve the goal of 10 billion in military morale fundraising, so that they feel that the people in the rear have not forgotten them, and it is worth fighting and bleeding. In particular, the members of the Chinese Kuomintang should set an example and be the vanguard for the people. The Kuomintang created the Republic of China and led the War of Resistance. Today, it must not sit idly by and watch the Republic of China be destroyed. In addition, I hope that the members of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party will cooperate together, and I hope that the Allied countries, especially the United States, can exert more economic power to jointly achieve world peace. As for those who attempt to undermine our movement with the tail of the Communist Party, we should warn them that these people are the current enemies of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan was invited to attend a meeting in Wuxi, so Secretary-General Xiang Changquan represented him and delivered a speech, elaborating on his experience of personally witnessing the atrocities of the Communist army in Jiangxi and Anhui in 1934. Then Cao Jun, Xuan Tiewu, Hua Shengmo, Fu Zhengmo, and others gave speeches, all hoping that all circles would respond to the military morale movement. Hua also elaborated on the fact that the Communist Party in Xinjiang colluded with a certain country to disrupt the area.</p>
<p>The Rally Resolved to Send Telegrams of Respect</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu proposed that the rally endorse the general mobilization order, send telegrams to Generals Du Yuming and Chen Mingren, as well as the soldiers fighting in Sipingjie, send telegrams to all the Communist bandit suppression officers and soldiers across the country, and send telegrams to the military and political officials in Xinjiang, asking them to defend the territory. Then, Chairman Fang led everyone in chanting slogans before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>[Another News] The ten thousand yuan military morale donation fundraising will begin on the 25th, but when the military morale rally was held yesterday, some citizens enthusiastically donated. Mayor Wu reported that the first donors were Lu Jiadong, Lu Jialiang, Li Hongyu, and Sun Yuqing, the workers of Fuxin Broadcasting Company, who donated a total of 200,000 yuan. Then the Grand Theater donated 3 million yuan, the principal of a certain elementary school in Zhabei, Wang Jincheng, donated 50,000 yuan, the director of the News Office of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, Director Li, donated half a month's salary of 150,000 yuan, the monk of Longhua Temple, Xin Ci, donated 50,000 yuan by saving food, the staff of Heping Daily donated 3 million yuan, the 20 district branches directly under the city party headquarters 100,000 yuan, the workers of Tianyi, Tianli, and Tianyuan factories 10,000 yuan each, the Stone Engineering Association 500,000 yuan, and the donations from other groups and individuals were also very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Transferred Retired Military Officers; Sixty-One People Serving in Two Roads</h3>
<p>There are two batches of transferred retired military officers who have been assigned to the transportation personnel of the two roads for internship. The first batch is 27 people from the Nanjing Central Training Corps, and the second batch is 34 people from the Xi'an Central Training Corps, a total of 61 people. They are divided into three groups: transportation, engineering, and machinery. They have reported to the road one after another and assigned to various units for internship. According to the plan, the transfer of retired officers and soldiers to various national construction work is a pioneering work in our country. The road bureau attaches great importance to these interns. Director Chen specially convened all the transferred military officers a few days ago to give a speech, asking in detail about the past training and current internship situation of each person. Finally, he encouraged all students to continue to work hard in national construction with the spirit of sacrificing for the country in the past.</p>
<h3>Traffic Improvement in Xujiahui; Circular Road Circle Completed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In order to improve the traffic in the western district of the former French Concession, the Municipal Public Works Bureau opened Kangping Road, relocated the telephone poles on Huashan Road, widened the road surface, and added half of the road surface on Guangyuan Road, making the four roads connected to form a circular road circle. The above project started in mid-May of this year and was completed in its entirety a few days ago, totaling more than 80 million yuan. Since the opening of the five public bus lines by the Public Utility Bureau, the traffic near Jiaotong University in Xujiahui has been busy. The road surface there was originally mostly dilapidated, and the section from Huashan Road to Tianping Road was originally an undeveloped small road. After being improved by the Public Works Bureau, all kinds of vehicles can pass without obstruction on Kangping Road, Guangyuan Road, Tianping Road and the section to Huashan Road.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fellow Townsmen Decide to Comfort the Righteous Army in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] More than a thousand members of the Northeast Righteous Army, who had passed through Shanghai from Xinjiang to return to their hometowns, are temporarily stationed at the Jiaotong Railway School, waiting for ships to go to Northeast China. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, Northeast fellow townsmen in Shanghai gathered at the International Hotel to discuss comfort methods. Mo Dehui, Li Pulin, Qi Shiying, Shi Bingyan, Ding Guitang, Sun Qinglin, and others attended.

The article is thousands of words long, passionate and agitated, causing the readers' hearts to ache.</p>
<h3>Indicting Ten French Nationals; Chali and Others Suspected of Collaborating with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] During the period when the Japanese enemy occupied Shanghai, ten French nationals in this city, Chali, Aliliyerweng, Dani Aike Wengli, Laolang Gaoyuese, Sikelai, Muniai Aojute, Laodong, Haluo, Chale Aier, and Miulate, participated in the fake German-French Association organized by the French Nazi member TCarcopino as members, propagated German-French cooperation, and attempted to resist their home country. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters opened a list, sent it to the city's High Procuratorate for investigation, and the case was investigated and verified by the City Police Bureau. The High Procuratorate charged that China had declared war on Germany, and Chali and others had conspired with the enemy country to resist the Allied countries, violating the crime of collaborating with the enemy in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Strange Youth at Inn: Mentally Disturbed and Incoherent; Claims to be a Student of National Central University in Nanjing; Whereabouts of the Young Woman He Was Lodging With Remain a Mystery</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Cheng (18 years old), a Hunan native claiming to be a sophomore in the Department of Political Science at National Central University in Nanjing, checked into the Da Jiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road the night before last with a young woman. The hotel staff led them to room 572 on the fifth floor. In addition to writing his own name, age, native place, and occupation in the guest registration book, he also filled in the name Wang Ruizhen, 18 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 87 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, for the woman. He also showed the books and Western newspaper he was carrying to prove his identity. The night passed without incident. Yesterday morning, after the two got up, they went out together. However, when they returned, only Zhang was present. Zhang's face was pale, and he shouted loudly after entering the room. The tea server, hearing the noise, found it strange. About half an hour later, it became quiet again, making him even more suspicious. He secretly went to investigate and saw that Zhang appeared to have taken poison. He immediately reported to the police and sent Zhang to the hospital for treatment. However, after the doctor administered an enema, there was no evidence of poisoning, but it was felt that he was mentally disturbed. Zhang continued to shout. When asked where he lived, he spoke incoherently, sometimes saying Daxia University, sometimes Tongji University, and finally saying he was staying at Fudan University. When asked who the young woman he was lodging with was, he claimed she was a childhood classmate. However, according to eyewitnesses at the hotel that night, there was no doubt that she was a prostitute, as an old woman followed behind the young woman before they checked in.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Occurs in Jiangwan in Broad Daylight; Victim Released Within Four Hours; Couple Guarding the Secret Room Arrested; The Fugitive Mastermind Once Held a Puppet Military Position</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At around 12 noon on the 19th, a car suddenly arrived at the Xizhangjiazhai Village in Jiangwan Town. Inside the car sat three plainclothes men and two uniformed men. The men pulled out guns and forced villager Zhang Jingen into the car, speeding away. Afterwards, Zhang Jinfeng, the victim's brother, reported the incident to the Jiangwan Police Station based on information he had received. Upon receiving the report, Chief Ye immediately ordered the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, Shi Junrong, to lead detectives Wen Jun, Li Defang, Inspector Liao Tangqing, police officers Zhu Songliang, Shi Kaitai, and Wang Zhigong to investigate. They learned that Zhang Jingen was being held at No. 14, Lane 484, Tongbei Road. The officers rushed to the location, broke down the door, and rescued the victim in a secret room. They also found a note posted outside the room, which read, "This is an important criminal. No one is allowed to see him. [Signed] Wu Jie." The couple guarding the victim, Qi Jiagen and Qi Xiuying (female), were taken to the station for questioning. They confessed that the mastermind, Wu Jie, was on the run. It is reported that Wu had served as a captain in the Gendarmerie and a company commander in the puppet army during the enemy occupation. Recently, he has been involved in several kidnapping cases. The entire operation, from the kidnapping to the rescue, took only four hours.</p>
<h3>Chairman Fang Hosts Tea Party for Overseas Chinese Tourist Group; Discusses the Situation of Overseas Chinese; Enjoys Very Strict Restrictions on Civil Rights; Severe Rice Shortage Leads to Sharp Increase in Living Expenses</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The entire group of sixteen members of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth Corps of Selangor who have returned to China to visit the country, namely Zou Wantian, Huang Youguang, Hu Weimin, Wu Hanyong, Zheng Mingpan, Huang Youhan, Ruan Mu'e, Chen Jianqing, Chen Kehan, Liu Wenyan, Luo Changling, Dai Dehuai, Lin Hua, Qiu Youlan, Liu Yanzhu, and Chen Yu , led by Group Leader Liu Xichun, arrived in Shantou on the 29th of last month via the "Haixia" of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from Singapore, and then arrived in Shanghai in three batches by plane. They stayed at the Youth Hostel and have been visiting major construction projects in the city. They are scheduled to attend a tea party hosted by Mayor Wu this afternoon, and then take the train to Hangzhou tonight. After a short stay, they will travel to Nanjing, Beijing, Chongqing, and Wuhan for sightseeing, before returning to Singapore via Guangzhou. Chairman Fang of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters held a tea party at the headquarters at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, attended by more than 20 people from the city's literary, art, and journalistic circles. During the tea party, Chairman Fang gave a speech, expressing his warm welcome and providing a detailed analysis of the current situation at home and abroad. He encouraged party members and corps members to work hard for the country. The guests and hosts had a pleasant conversation and dispersed in high spirits.</p>
<p>The Labor Party's Activities Have Lost Popular Support</p>
<p>The reporter had a very detailed conversation with many members of the group. The main points are summarized as follows: The political life of overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia is obviously different from before the war. Before the war, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia rarely participated in political life. During the war, when various parts of Southeast Asia fell, the Communist Party took the opportunity to promote its cause and organize anti-Japanese armies. After the victory, the government still allowed the Communist Party to continue its activities. Eventually, its actions became out of line, resembling treason. The people saw through their deceit, and they have now greatly lost popular support. Furthermore, before the war, overseas Chinese were heavily oppressed by the British. After the war, China's international status improved, allowing them to enjoy civil rights. However, these civil rights are very strictly restricted. The conditions are that they must (1) have resided in the local area for more than 25 years, and (2) be able to speak and write in English or Malay. Today, most overseas Chinese, especially those of older generations, can speak but not write, so only a small number are able to enjoy the so-called civil rights. After the war, the British took advantage of the local conflict between the Nationalists and Communists, alienating the relationship between overseas Chinese, which greatly affected the unity of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Lack of Machinery Leads to Sharp Decline in Production</p>
<p>Secondly, the economic life of overseas Chinese is mainly based on the production of rubber, tin, and mines. After the war, due to a lack of machinery, production has sharply declined, while the cost of living is ten times higher than before the war. Workers are demanding higher wages, making it difficult for employers to cope. The most serious problem is the widespread rice shortage in various parts of Southeast Asia. The Malayan government has implemented a controlled distribution system, requiring 30 catties of rice per person per month, but only 8 catties are allocated. The authorities allow overseas Chinese to freely transport 20% of their needs from Thailand, India, Java, and Burma, but this is still not enough. Workers' wages are entirely determined by the price of rice. As for the culture and education of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, primary schools are the most common everywhere. Children under 20 and over 8 can speak Mandarin. High school is the highest level of education, with only one English university in Singapore.</p>
<p>Women are Conservative, Just Like in the Mainland</p>
<p>There are two Chinese newspapers, the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew Jit Poh, which are of higher quality and have fair opinions. There are also two local newspapers, the China Press and the Min Sheng Pao. There are many English newspapers, all run by the British government, which publish as much news about China's war as possible and exaggerate it, which greatly affects overseas Chinese who do not understand Chinese. Women's lives are as conservative as in the mainland, and few women work in society. Finally, they expressed their hope that the country will be unified and peaceful soon. Overseas Chinese are all patriotic and support any political party that is beneficial to the country. Conversely, they will oppose any political party to the end, no matter what it is.</p>

<h3>First Brigade of Voluntary Inspectors Holds Founding Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The founding ceremony of the First Brigade of the Voluntary Inspection Corps of the Songhu Garrison Command was held at the Tianchan Theater on Fuzhou Road yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. Guests from all walks of life included Mayor Wu (represented by Shen Zonglian), Commander Xuan, Yu Shuping, Yang Hu, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiyu, and 500 volunteer inspectors. All were dressed in grass-green uniforms, arranged in rows, sitting upright, looking exceptionally brave. Tao Yishan, the chairman and brigade commander, said in his speech that the volunteer inspectors were all former students of the Public Training School and had made their greatest efforts in the war of resistance. Now, they are assisting the public security authorities and serving the people. Commander Xuan then delivered a speech, explaining the four conditions that soldiers must possess: (1) progressive thinking, (2) revolutionary spirit, (3) upright conduct, and (4) noble character. Yang Hu, Shen Zonglian, and others then delivered speeches. The ceremony ended at around 11:00 a.m. After the meeting, all the members of the team went to the Kangle Restaurant for a meal.</p>

<h3>Flying Disc Appears in Shanghai: Turns Out to Be a Balloon; Mr. Fan Jiakang Gives a Detailed Account of the Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the mystery of the flying disc's visit to Shanghai, Mr. Fan Jiakang, an American United Press radiotelegraph operator and radiotelegraph operator at the Jiangwan Radio Station, recently wrote: "On the night before last (the 19th), I happened to see a luminous object at the Jiangwan Radio Station, moving from northwest to east, about 10,000 feet above the ground. I immediately called several American soldiers on the scene to watch together, which lasted for about 20 minutes. At first, I thought this object was the recently rumored flying disc, but the American soldiers did not think so, and pointed out that it was a weather balloon. I was half believing and half doubting, so last night I personally went to the U.S. Army Air Transport Station at Jiangwan Airport to investigate the matter. It was said that the station does indeed release weather balloons day and night to forecast the weather, and lights are carried on the balloons at night. Then, after the station inquired with the previous night shift personnel, it notified me by telephone that the station had released a weather balloon at midnight on the 19th. Therefore, I believe that the flying disc said in the newspaper must be a misrepresentation."</p>
<h3>The Day Agricultural Land Reform Is Implemented Will Be the Day the Civil War Is Suppressed; Zhu Ping Broadcasts on National Suppression of Rebellion and Agricultural Land Reform</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] This newspaper held its sixteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Datong Radio Station, inviting Zhu Ping, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, to broadcast on "National Suppression of Rebellion and Agricultural Land Reform." The following is an excerpt from his speech:</p>
<p>After eight years of arduous war of resistance, our country's rehabilitation work has not yet been completed, and now we have to implement mobilization to suppress the rebellion. This is indeed an unfortunate thing, but in order to protect local order and protect national survival, armed suppression of the rebellion is inevitable. We, standing in the position of a national citizen, can only concentrate our will, unite our strength, and support national policy, in order to pacify the civil war as soon as possible, to shorten the mobilization time to a minimum, and to reduce the sacrifices of suppressing the rebellion to a minimum.</p>
<p>Rural Collapse and Heretical Theories Prevail</p>
<p>Although the factors of the current civil war are quite complicated, its main knot lies in the failure to solve the "peasant problem." Because China is still an agricultural country, the vast majority of the population are farmers, and the most important production is agriculture. Even the industrial workers in the cities and the soldiers in the army all come from the countryside. The security of the regime is closely related to the support of the farmers. Therefore, solving the peasant problem is the key to solving the entire China problem. The core of the peasant problem is the "land problem." Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, put forward the program of "equal land rights" forty years ago as the main goal of the revolution. Twenty years ago, he put forward the policy of "land to the tiller" as a concrete guideline for solving the peasant problem, which had wise foresight. Unfortunately, in the past twenty years, this important national policy has not been effectively implemented, resulting in the collapse of the rural economy and the displacement of most farmers. Heretical theories have taken advantage of this gap to enter, and the vast countryside has been occupied by the Communist Party as a base for launching rebellions. This is the root cause of our country's civil war. Therefore, solving the land problem is the only way to eradicate the source of chaos and stabilize society. If we abandon this and do not plan for it, then I am afraid that we will only make the situation more chaotic.</p>
<p>Liberating the Economy and Improving Living Standards</p>
<p>Solving the land problem was originally a wonderful national policy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Because it has not been implemented for a long time, good farmers have been tempted by heretical theories, and the vast countryside has been stolen by bandits. It is very regrettable to say. Now that we have clearly ordered mobilization and implemented suppression of the rebellion, we should treat both the symptoms and the root cause, and we should focus on the location of the knot and eliminate the source of chaos in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort and achieve a permanent effect. As for the specific strategy for solving the land problem, there is no better way than to implement the land capitalization program (this plan was proposed by me at the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang, and was enthusiastically approved by the congress, and was designated by Chairman Chiang as a key case that must be implemented, and has been ordered by the central government to all relevant ministries and commissions). There are three steps in the process: first, to conduct economic surveys of rural areas and tenant industries; second, to implement joint rent payment and joint rent collection, while adjusting the burden of land taxes; and third, to transfer land funds to industrial funds. The main purpose of this program is to enable farmers to obtain economic liberation, so as to improve their lives, and to have surplus power to engage in improving production. At the same time, financial and technical assistance is provided, and the organization of farmers is guided to engage in collective farming, so as to improve productivity and increase production. On one side, a warehouse network is established so that national food can be adjusted at any time without fear of shortage.</p>
<p>Transfer of Land Funds for Construction</p>
<p>As for the landlord, he can obtain his due land, and at the same time, the government guarantees the principal and interest, and guides him to invest in industry, so that the funds originally stagnant on the land can be transferred to industrial construction. According to my estimation, the total amount of land funds that can be used is very large. If calculated at the current currency value, it can be about 900 trillion yuan. If distributed over a period of fifteen years to use these funds, there will be a huge amount of 60 trillion yuan per year to use this capital in industrial construction. Therefore, the implementation of the land capitalization program can not only solve the land problem, stabilize rural order, and prosper Chengye's production, but also can collect industrial funds to promote the implementation of China's industrialization.</p>
<p>If China's land problem can be solved, then the farmers' lives can be improved, the rural economy can be prospered, and industrial construction can be developed day by day. If the national economy can thrive, then what will the city foxes and social rats rely on, and how can heretical theories enter? The fundamental plan to eliminate the source of chaos lies in this. Therefore, the author said very firmly, "The day when agricultural land reform is implemented will be the day when the civil war is suppressed."</p>

<h3>Special Broadcast Program</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper held its sixteenth special broadcast, starting at 9:00 a.m. Dr. Zhong Zhihe spoke on "Analysis of Symptoms of Tuberculosis Patients," and Lin Lesheng spoke on "Religious Lecture." From 1:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., harmonica master Wang Qinglong played music. From 2:00 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., Miss Bao Hanying spoke on "Children's Stories." At 4:10 p.m., Lawyer Mi Xitong spoke on "The Legal Viewpoints That Merchants Should Have on Commercial Names." From 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., Dr. Wang Juerong spoke on "Prenatal and Postnatal Care." From 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., there was Yue opera by the Tongsheng Music Society. From 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m., there were major changes to the original program, but the results were even better. For example, Mr. Zhang Zhesheng, Ms. Xian Wen, and Mr. Liu Chunhua of the Datong Radio Station temporarily filled in. Miss Zhu Min sang Fen He Wan, and Mr. Bao Shixian, Zhang Zhesheng, and Fan Shiren sang Selling Horses. Li Qianghua and Sister Weihua sang Wilderness Tears and Trial of the Head respectively. Shen Bainian and Mr. Bao Shixian sang Female Escort, Hu Qin was played by Ni Qiuping and Ruoqi. Miss Fu Ronghua sang Scolding Wang Lang, He Shixi, Zhang Zhesheng, Bao Shixian, and Gu Wen sang Heroes' Meeting, from Jiang Gan Crossing the River to Stealing the Book. Mr. Chen Dezhen sang Hong Yang Dong, and Hou Meisheng sang Ganlu Temple. In addition, the famous Fu Hou Meisheng, the famous Qin Master Zhao Geng, Fu Baoqing Sha Shaochun, have repeatedly helped this newspaper with special broadcasts, sometimes drumming, sometimes playing the strings. At this time, the heat is so hot, and the sweat is like rain, which is especially touching. The address on the guest registration book, No. 87 Sichuan Road, was later found to be fictitious. Also, when the police station investigated, Zhang once said that the woman lived at No. 10 Xiangfen Lane, but when they went to inquire, there was no such thing either. In summary, there are many untruthful things in the previous situation, so the truth is still under investigation.</p>

<h3>The "Lei Zu" of the Scientific Age: Dr. Yun He, the Inventor of "Yun Si," is One of the Few Female Talents in the Industrial World</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] We cannot but admit that in recent years, the scope of Chinese women's work in society and the achievements they have made have been expanding day by day. Not only in education, culture, politics, society, science, law and other aspects have women proved that they are as capable as men in important work, but also in the industrial and commercial circles, there are women leading businesses. Dr. Yun He (pictured), General Manager of China Ramie Industry Company, is one example.</p>
<p>The reason why Ms. Zheng is the General Manager of China Ramie Industry Company is not because she owns family property, opens a large store and hangs up a name to become the boss, but because of the results of her painstaking research on ramie fiber for more than ten years. In 1925, Ms. Zheng graduated from Peiping Women's Higher Normal School, and in 1927, she went to the United States for further study. She studied at Ohio, Michigan, and Chicago Universities in the United States, and obtained a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Ohio University. However, she still felt that her knowledge and experience were insufficient, so she traveled to various places after leaving school to investigate industry. In 1932, she went to Europe for investigation, and in the autumn of the same year, she returned to China and joined Yenching University in Peiping as a professor of chemistry. In 1933, she went to Germany again to practice and study in Berlin University and various factories and schools in German cities. At that time, Ms. Zheng began to study ramie (which foreigners call China Grass because China produces the most), and also used rice straw, sugar cane residue, etc. as raw materials for rayon. She believed that ramie contained high-quality fibers that could be used as textile raw materials, without having to destroy them and then make them into rayon and artificial fibers.</p>
<p>Yun Si Invented and Government Granted Patent</p>
<p>After returning to China in 1936, Ms. Zheng continued to conduct in-depth research. The total fiber was extracted from the ramie by chemical methods, which became something as white and soft as cotton and silk. Ms. Zheng called it "Yun Si" because after tearing it apart, it looked like clouds in the sky. Later, she wove Yun Si into cotton wool, and when the Chongqing Qianchuan Factory held an exhibition, the late Chairman Lin gave it a name called "Snow Spring," which means snow-white, soft, and warm. This "Yun Si" was invented by Ms. Zheng and has been granted a patent by the government. The use of "Yun Si" can be woven into various cloths, wool, summer uniform fabrics, suits or women's outerwear fabrics, sofa covers, cotton wool, etc. When the reporter visited, Ms. Zheng showed the reporter various samples, which were indeed similar to thin woolen serge. The advantages are that it is wrinkle-free, cool, light, and very hygienic due to chemical production. The cost is slightly more expensive than cotton, but less than one-fourth of the price of silk wool.</p>
<p>Plans to Set Up Factories in Various Places for Manufacturing</p>
<p>China Ramie Industry Company was established in April last year with a capital of 200 million yuan. It is assisted by the Central Trust Bureau of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Bank, the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Association Postal Remittance Bureau, and other enterprises. The chairman is Vice Chairman Sun, representing the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Association. The company has not yet officially opened for business. However, the company already has a manufacturing plant in Chongqing, which can produce three to four tons of "Yun Si" per day. At the same time, offices have been set up in Shanghai, Hankou, Hong Kong, and Guangdong. Currently, due to the ramie harvesting season, the offices are going to Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and other ramie producing areas to purchase ramie, and are preparing to manufacture "Yun Si" in large quantities this winter and hope to sell it abroad. In Guangdong, the provincial government plans to provide machines and factory buildings to China Ramie Industry Company and cooperate with it. This is currently under discussion. In the future, branch factories are planned to be established in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankou, and other places.</p>
<p>In addition, Ms. Zheng still has a great interest in rayon. In 1936, she planned to establish the China Rayon Factory, but it was suspended due to the war. However, she said that if she has the opportunity, she still wants to develop in this area.</p>
<p>Family Learning and Husband and Wife Are Like-Minded</p>
<p>Ms. Zheng is from Jinan, Shandong. Her father worked as an engineer in Shandong in his early years, which had a great influence on her interest in science and industry from an early age. The strength of her mother is what has enabled her to persevere for so many years. She believes that a person must have a moral foundation to run a business. Her moral foundation was given by her mother, but unfortunately the old man passed away when she was in middle school. Her husband, Xiong Zilin, is also a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of Berlin in Germany. He is currently the general manager of the Southwest Chemical Industry Manufacturing Plant in Chongqing. They are truly a like-minded couple.</p>
<p>As for the basic reason why she is interested in fiber chemistry, it is because she feels that the use of fiber is too wide. Many things in clothing and supplies are made of fiber, and even the gunpowder used in war is made of fiber. Therefore, it can protect the country in wartime and benefit the country and the people in peacetime. It is necessary to promote this kind of industry. She also said that women must have practical knowledge to be independent. For example, 90% of the manufacturing work such as rayon is done by female workers. The contribution of women to industry and commerce will be amazing, as long as they are given the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Arrested for Hosting a Banquet at the Confucius Temple; Zhang Xiaolong Was Once a Tiger's Accomplice; High Prosecutor's Office Investigates and Files a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Qinglong, originally from Nanling, Anhui, later moved to Shenyang, and graduated from the Japanese Imperial University. In 1942, he became a traitor in Shanghai and served as a secret agent for the Shanghai Enemy Gendarmerie and a translator for the Mei Agency, plotting against many underground workers of the central government. The arrests of Jiang Bocheng and Yang Hu, who were betrayed, were also secretly reported by this traitor. Zhang was extremely promiscuous and frequented dance halls. It is unknown how many so-called red county women were raped by him. After the victory, he used the alias Mei Xin and hid in Nanjing. He then served as the deputy warehouse director of the Zhenjiang warehouse of the Logistics Department. He was arrested on May 25 last year while hosting a banquet at the Petit Paris Restaurant in the Confucius Temple in Nanjing. He was initially tried by the Military Law Department of the Logistics Department, but because Zhang's crime took place in Shanghai, he was transferred to the Municipal High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Recently, after investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, Zhang was charged with violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Item 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and was prosecuted according to law.</p>
<h3>Single-Person Tricycles Obstruct Traffic; Rickshaws Temporarily Stop Being Converted</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rickshaws in this city were previously ordered to be converted into single-person rear-seat tricycles. The first batch of vehicles to be eliminated has already been completed. The second phase of the elimination was suspended by the central government, so it has not yet been carried out. However, those who voluntarily apply for elimination and conversion are not subject to restrictions. Up to now, a total of more than 6,000 vehicles have been converted, and there are still some that are being converted. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that the speed of these converted vehicles is faster than rickshaws and slower than cars. They run rampant and obstruct traffic more than rickshaws. It is planned to follow the explicit instructions of the Executive Yuan to temporarily suspend the elimination of rickshaws, as well as the recent requests from the rickshaw industry association, and to temporarily suspend the automatic elimination and conversion into single-person rear-seat tricycles. The above proposal was put forward by the Public Works Bureau for discussion at the traffic review meeting in the central district. After discussion, it was decided to temporarily retain it, and then submit it to the Municipal Affairs Conference for further study before submitting it to the Municipal Council for decision.</p>
<h3>Rice Store Owner Arrested for Selling Rationed Rice at Black Market Prices</h3>
<p>The Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters received a tip-off yesterday that a local man, Cao Xilin, opened the Yuancheng Rice Store at No. 150 Xuejiabang Road in Nanshi. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau distributed 30 bags of rice to the store (each bag weighing 125 catties), but he did not sell it according to the rationed price. Instead, he secretly sold it all to a rice restaurant on Wujiang Road at black market prices. The brigade investigated and found this to be true, so yesterday afternoon at 6:00 p.m., they summoned the store owner Cao Xilin for strict questioning.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of the Late Chairman Lin's Relics - Subscription for Admission Tickets Extremely Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The late Chairman Lin was fond of calligraphy and painting throughout his life and was skilled in connoisseurship. His inherited calligraphy and paintings, from the Song and Yuan dynasties to modern times, number no less than a thousand pieces, all of which are treasures. Ancient works include Buddhist images by Li Longmian, "Washing the Elephant" by Yuan artists, landscapes by Gu Huating, Shen Shitian, Shi Tao, Wang Shiguy, and Gong Banqian, and calligraphy by Fang Xiaoru, Wen Huiming, Wang Duo, Chuan Qingzhu, and Zhang Ershui. Modern works include authentic calligraphy and paintings by Zeng Nongqiu and Qing Daoren, all of which are exceptionally famous and valuable. Currently, the chairman's family is selling these calligraphy and paintings in accordance with his will, to establish a fund for the Shanggan Linsen School. The exhibition will be held at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road from the 20th to the 25th. Those who wish to purchase can buy a calligraphy and painting ticket for 600,000 yuan and draw lots to obtain a piece. Yesterday was the first day, and those visiting and buying tickets were very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet "Treasures" - Difficult to Distinguish Genuine from Fake - Special Experts Appointed for Appraisal</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office has received dozens of boxes of antiques, calligraphy, and paintings, some of which may be Japanese calligraphy and paintings, or porcelain and stoneware, not all of which are precious items. Expert appraisal is essential. To strengthen the handling of enemy and puppet industries, the office has recently appointed several experts to appraise authenticity and falsity before pricing and auctioning them off. Special fine items will reportedly be transferred to government-run museums for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>China Travel Service Issues Joint Transportation Tickets for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway resumed operation after urgent repairs, passengers have praised its convenience. However, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou to transfer to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway often find the stopover time in Hangzhou too short to purchase tickets for that railway, resulting in unnecessary delays. It is now learned that the China Travel Service in this city, for the convenience of travelers, has reached an agreement with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities. Starting from the 20th of this month, the agency will issue joint transportation tickets from Shanghai to major stations along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, initially limited to Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, and Lanxi. After arriving in Hangzhou, passengers can board the reserved-seat train departing from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at 1:30 PM, avoiding unnecessary delays and reserving seats in advance. This is truly good news for travelers.</p>
<h3>Director of the Taishan Sanatorium Accused of Abuse and Abandonment - Cohabiting with a Japanese Woman - Beating His Wife Causing Injury</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Lin Bohui, director of the Taishan Sanatorium on Linsen Middle Road, is accused of abusing his wife and abandoning his children due to his affair with a Japanese woman. His wife filed a claim with the District Procuratorate, including documentation of her injuries, and filed a lawsuit. According to the complaint: Lin Bohui, a native of Fuzhou, is 48 years old. He was raised by his uncle, a Japanese businessman named Lin Qingchun, and received Japanese education. He graduated from South Manchuria Medical College and worked as an internist at Fuzhou Bo'ai Hospital before the war. Later, he established Chengnan Hospital in Nantai, Fuzhou. His wife, Qi Guangyu, graduated from Fujian Normal School. They have been married for 23 years and have eight children. Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Chen Yi, the chairman of Fujian Province, sent Lin to Kyushu Imperial University Medical School in Japan for advanced studies because Lin was proficient in Japanese. In 1940, Lin obtained a medical doctorate and returned to Shanghai with a Japanese nurse, Hirota Tokiko, opening a clinic in the Zhongxing Building on Fourth Road. He then began cohabiting with Hirota Tokiko in Hongkou. At that time, Fuzhou fell to the enemy, and Qi's mother and children fled to Shanghai. Lin completely ignored the livelihood of his wife and children, so his wife lived with her mother's family. Later, Lin, relying on the power of his mistress Hirota Tokiko's collusion with the enemy and puppet regime, acquired a building on Linsen Middle Road and opened the Taishan Sanatorium, serving as its director. He also rented a building from Hartong on Weihaiwei Road, renaming it Lin Village, as his residence. Through the intervention of Qi Guangyu's mother's family, Qi's mother and children also moved in to live together, but they were often beaten by Lin and his mistress. After the victory, Hirota Tokiko changed her name to Sotsu Ranyu and continued to hide in the Taishan Sanatorium. Recently, when Qi went to get living expenses, she was beaten and injured by Lin again. Qi, unable to bear the abuse, went to the District Procuratorate to document her injuries, where Prosecutor Yu Yixin summoned both parties for questioning and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Inspect the Work Competition of Transportation Agencies</h3>
<p>The Central Work Competition Promotion Committee was ordered to strengthen work competition in order to coordinate with the General Mobilization Act. The committee sent Xu Yanfei, director of the Transportation Business Department, to Shanghai yesterday to guide the competition among central transportation agencies in the city. Yesterday afternoon, he listened to a report from Deputy General Manager Shen at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It is understood that since the implementation of the competition system, the company has achieved remarkable results, with the wheel transport work competition led by Zhang Shouguan and the wharf cleaning competition organized by Shen Daowu being the most successful. Before the competition, the Shanghai-Hankou route took 15 days, and the Shanghai-Tianjin route took 10 days. After the competition, the Shanghai-Hankou route was reduced to 10 days, and the Shanghai-Tianjin route was reduced to 7 days. Nine wharves participated in the cleaning competition. In the first evaluation, Jinliyuan Wharf was rated as excellent, and in the second evaluation, Yangjiadu Wharf was rated as excellent, with certificates of merit issued by Director Xu. It is reported that Director Xu will inspect the Railway Administration and the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee starting next Monday.</p>

<h3>Vice Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education Entertained Reporters in This City Yesterday - Current Educational Issues - Returned to Beijing by Night Train That Evening - Will Still Come to Shanghai in the Near Future</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, entertained reporters from various newspapers at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Academia Sinica at 320 Qiqi Road in this city. Chen Dongyuan, supervisor of the Ministry of Education, attended with him. Vice Minister Hang reported on current educational issues during the event:</p>
<p>Basic Education Issues</p>
<p>(1) The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Far East Basic Education Research Conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing from September 1st to 12th. The Ministry of Education has already convened a preparatory meeting for this purpose and invited eleven units including the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Burma, and Siam to participate. Japan is not included. After the conference, a tour will begin on the 13th, and they will come to Shanghai on the 15th for a stay of about three days. I have already contacted the Municipal Education Bureau to prepare for the tour, hoping that after mutual observation among the Far Eastern countries, basic education can be promoted and popularized. The meaning of basic education includes national education, mass education, and social education. In addition to literacy, people also need to have national consciousness, production skills, and common sense of science and hygiene. This is the same as the educational purpose stipulated in our country's constitution, which is to cultivate civic morality, national consciousness, sound physical fitness, scientific knowledge, and production skills. The so-called "poverty, disease, ignorance, and selfishness" are China's four major enemies. Now, production skills can eliminate poverty, sound physical fitness can eliminate disease, education and literacy can eliminate ignorance, and civic consciousness can eliminate selfishness. This is not only an educational issue but also a basic issue for national establishment. Therefore, basic education is a major task in the period of national construction. Now that the country is embarking on the road to democracy, we can advocate the slogan "Education for Democracy," which also includes the above-mentioned points. Therefore, basic education is the greatest need for education in China today. In addition to making the people literate in the simplest way, we also use the latest scientific methods such as educational films and educational broadcasts to promote and popularize it.</p>
<p>School Equipment Issues</p>
<p>(2) How can Chinese education make progress after the restoration? The most important thing is still the equipment of books, instruments, and stationery. For example, magazines can be used for scientific research, and European and American countries have complete sets. Our country, due to the relationship of the Anti-Japanese War, has lost some or is not provided by foreign countries, resulting in incompleteness and difficulty in understanding the process stage. The Ministry of Education previously negotiated with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and United Nations agencies for an allocation of 4 million US dollars due to the government's lack of foreign exchange for the purchase of books, instruments, and stationery. Later, when 3.2 million US dollars were used, the government used the remaining funds to purchase cotton. To date, of the books, instruments, and stationery ordered, more than 900 boxes of engineering equipment have been shipped to Shanghai and stored at Jiaotong University. The Ministry of Education has specially organized a distribution committee to be responsible for inspection and distribution work. In the future, all colleges of engineering in the recovered areas of the country can have a set of equipment. Other ordered agricultural and medical equipment are also available and will be distributed to various schools in order after they arrive within the year. The Ministry of Education will continue to apply to the government for funds and find other ways to obtain foreign exchange in order to continue ordering national harmful instruments and stationery from abroad to enrich the equipment of various schools.</p>
<p>School Building Issues</p>
<p>(3) The number of professors and students in various schools has increased several times compared to before the war, and the original school buildings are not enough. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly requested additional funding for the necessary construction of national schools. The government, due to limited funding, has raised funds as much as possible, and recently decided to allocate 65 billion yuan. I have conducted a survey of various schools during this trip to Shanghai, and a portion of the construction costs will also be allocated in the future. After Vice Minister Hang finished his report, reporters from various newspapers asked questions, and Vice Minister Hang answered them one by one as follows:</p>
<p>Study Abroad Examination Issues</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of studying abroad, there are now two different views in the country. One believes that the country needs talents and should first expand domestic educational institutions, which can also reduce the outflow of foreign exchange. The other believes that the domestic level is not enough and a large number of students should be sent abroad. The current practice of the Ministry of Education is a compromise, that is, sending students abroad in consideration of the actual situation. Our country's study abroad system started in 1872 and has a history of more than 70 years. In the beginning, there was no overall plan, so the results were not ideal. I personally believe that national construction requires talents, and studying abroad is indeed necessary. Therefore, we have been helping those who have the opportunity to go abroad as much as possible last year and this year. However, due to the limited financial resources of the country, the more than 1,000 people who passed the self-funded study abroad examination last year required 4 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Therefore, although the Ministry of Education feels the need for talents, there are indeed difficulties in reality. This summer, there are no plans to hold a self-funded study abroad examination. Although the list of those who passed the translator study abroad examination has been announced, they are still in the process of contacting schools, and it may not be possible to go abroad within the year.</p>
<p>Professor Dismissal Issues</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the dismissal of professors from some national universities in Shanghai, to my knowledge, the Ministry of Education has never authorized it. The Ministry of Education has appointed the president as the person in charge of a school and should absolutely trust the president, including the issue of appointing professors. The Ministry of Education does not need to send the list of professors hired by various schools for review, nor has it provided a list to various schools to authorize dismissal. The Ministry of Education trusts the president, and the president has the right to decide whether to reappoint professors after the annual assessment. Currently, universities in the United Kingdom decide on the appointment of professors through committees established within the school. Tsinghua University in China also has this organization. I personally believe that Chinese education needs scientific progress and academic freedom. Both professors and students need to understand that citizens of democratic countries have their rights and obligations. Although everyone may have different views on certain matters, they can have constructive suggestions for the school they serve, but not destructive actions. Students are the masters of the country in the future, and their actions, no matter what, cannot go beyond the law. Academic freedom means that political ideologies within the school can be different, but there is no need for actions such as strikes. For example, the famous universities of Cambridge and Oxford in the United Kingdom, everyone can have different political opinions, but it has never been heard of a strike for a certain number of days. Now that the General Mobilization Order has been issued in the country, anyone who violates the action of any party will be dealt with by law.</p>
<p>Arrested Student Issues</p>
<p>(3) I did not come to Shanghai for the issue of arrested students. However, I have been contacting various parties in the party and government organs as much as possible, hoping that those with minor offenses can be released on bail as soon as possible. (4) Xian Yu, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, has resigned and has been persuaded to stay. Some university presidents have resigned, perhaps because the situation within the school is complicated and difficult to handle. The Ministry of Education is currently discussing this.</p>
<p>[Another report] Vice Minister Hang invited those in charge of relevant colleges and universities last night to discuss the issue of reappointing professors for the next semester and returned to Beijing by night train that evening. According to Vice Minister Hang's statement to reporters: he will still come to Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<h3>Incumbent Elementary School Teachers Granted Postponement of Military Service</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 20th] Regarding whether incumbent elementary school teachers who have been employed for more than one year and have passed the review, but are not graduates of normal schools, or are graduates of normal schools, have passed the review, but have not been employed for more than one year; and incumbent substitute teachers who have graduated from junior high school and have passed the registration, can apply for postponement of military service in accordance with the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Military Service Law, the Ministry of National Defense has recently explained: Regarding the regulations on the postponement of elementary school teachers, the meaning of the text is clear and can be followed and handled. It has now issued a special order to the military service authorities of various provinces and cities to handle it.</p>
<h3>British University Professors Almost All Retained</h3>
<p>Compared to the First-Class Treatment in the Beijing-Shanghai Area</p>
<p>[Special report from Jinhua by this newspaper] The employment letters for the faculty and staff of Yingshi University for the 36th academic year have all been issued. It is reported that only one professor was dismissed, and the rest were all retained. There have been slight adjustments in the staff. The treatment of the school has been issued in accordance with the first-class salary in the Beijing-Shanghai area, and the life of the faculty and staff should be slightly more stable in the future.</p>
<h3>Kang Province Promotes Women's Normal Education - The Situation Is Special, and the Source of Female Students Is Not Easy - Strictly Abide by the Central Instructions and Gradually Develop</h3>
<p>[Special report from Kangding by this newspaper] The Xikang Education Department recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Education stating that the promotion of women's normal education has been circulated to various provinces and cities for implementation. Now, during the implementation of the five-year normal education plan for various provinces and cities after the war, various provinces and cities should actively promote it in accordance with the original order in order to complete it and ordered to obey and report. It is understood that the original order shows: (1) Each province and city should reach the principle of establishing one male and one female normal school in each designated normal school district. If two normal schools have been established in each district, a women's normal school department should be added to each school to promote women's normal education. (2) Each province should consider the local conditions of each county and promote the establishment of women's normal schools in appropriate counties in each province, and add women's simple normal classes in counties where simple normal schools have been established to accommodate female students who have graduated from elementary schools. If the simple normal schools in each province are suitable for co-educational teaching, they should still be handled in accordance with the old plan and do not need to be changed. (3) Starting from the 35th academic year, each province should increase the number of independent women's normal schools and recruit outstanding female students who have graduated from junior high school or elementary school. (4) The original independent women's normal schools or women's simple normal schools should increase the number of classes as much as possible. (5) The principal of a women's normal school should be female in principle. A review of the province's women's normal education has long been in strict compliance with the instructions of the Ministry of Education and the Central Government, paying attention to promotion. According to the actual situation in this province, the first step is to co-educate in the existing normal schools and simple normal schools, expand the number of female students as much as possible, and gradually increase the number of women's normal classes and simple normal classes, and then independently establish women's normal schools and simple normal schools, in order to gradually promote them. However, due to the special situation in this province, women's education at all levels is still in its infancy. It is difficult to recruit female students for the establishment of women's normal classes and simple normal classes. It is even more difficult to obtain student sources for the independent establishment of women's normal schools and simple normal schools. In the autumn of the 34th year, the plan to reorganize the provincial Kangding Normal School into a women's normal school was included in the province's plan to adjust normal education and was approved by the Ministry of Education. However, the first class of female students recruited was insufficient, and the source of female students would be even more scarce in the future, and the Ministry of Education was requested to postpone the establishment of the women's normal school. In this situation, the promotion of women's normal education in this province in the future is still planned to be handled in accordance with the aforementioned principle of gradual expansion and incorporated into the province's third normal education plan as a key implementation point. It is reported that the Education Department has reported this situation to the Ministry of Education for review.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Demobilized Youth Army - The Ministry of Education Plans to Adjust the Measures</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 19th] In response to the request of the Pre-Cadet Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Education has re-considered and distributed the graduates of the Youth Army who have been recommended to private universities in Beijing and Shanghai. The method is to refer to the family environment and voluntary requests of the Youth Army to adjust and distribute them to national universities in various places. This work can be handled within days. Registration procedures for students: Any Youth Army graduates who have been distributed to private universities and are now unable to afford the expenses due to the school authorities or personal economic circumstances can participate in the registration in order to handle it uniformly.</p>
<h3>Four Northwestern Universities to Hold Joint Enrollment at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Xi'an, 20th] National Northwestern University, National Lanzhou University, National Northwestern Normal College, and National Veterinary College have decided to jointly enroll students in Lanzhou and Xi'an in the autumn. The Lanzhou Enrollment Committee will directly handle the enrollment procedures, and the Xi'an branch will be established with Duan Zimei of the Lanzhou University Guidance Department dispatched to preside over it. The new student entrance examinations will be held simultaneously in the two places on August 5th, 6th, and 7th. It is reported that a certain university in Shanghai will be commissioned to recruit 10 to 20 new students from each department in order to attract ambitious youths from the southeastern region to the northwest. This plan will be decided and announced by the joint enrollment office of the four universities within the week.</p>
<h3>Election of Academicians of the Academia Sinica - Nomination Period Extended by One Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The preparation for the first election of academicians of the Academia Sinica has been going on for more than two months. Universities, colleges, specialized academic societies, or research institutions have been nominating candidates for academicians in an endless stream. The nomination period was originally scheduled to end on July 20th, but because the works of the nominees during the Anti-Japanese War were often lost and took time to collect, several universities and academic institutions requested an extension. In order to take into account the actual difficulties, the Academia Sinica has extended the nomination deadline to August 20th.</p>
<h3>Ministry-Compiled Elementary School Wall Charts - Hunan Province Requests Open Factory Rights</h3>
<p>[Changsha Aerial News] The Hunan Provincial National Education Association believes that since the copyright of the nationally designated textbooks has been made public, the wall charts that match the textbooks should also be freely printed by the workshops. These wall charts were previously compiled and drawn by the Ministry of Education and sold by the Xin Ya Bookstore, including various types such as children's health charts, daily routine charts, and social etiquette charts. The price was very high, and there were no distribution networks in various places, so general schools could not buy them. Therefore, it was specially submitted to the Ministry of Education to make the copyright public, so as to avoid monopoly and relieve the book shortage. At the same time, local reproduction and printing were carried out, which was very beautiful. The selling price of each set was only three-tenths of the original price, which was very popular among the schools.</p>
<h3>China Agricultural Society - Regular Meeting of the Ping Branch to Be Restored</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Agricultural colleges of universities and various agricultural, forestry, and cotton industry organizations in Ping City held a meeting this morning to prepare for the restoration of the Beiping branch of the China Agricultural Society. Mr. Sa, a British cotton industry expert, also participated. The meeting was chaired by Feng Zefang, director of the Improvement Office, and it was decided that each unit would recommend one person as a representative to prepare for the establishment of a regular meeting.</p>
<h3>Outstanding Elementary and Secondary School Teachers Must Not Be Dismissed Without Reason - The Ministry of Education Telegraphed Various Provinces and Cities for Notification</h3>
<p>[China News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to news from the Ministry of Education, the autumn semester is approaching, and many elementary and secondary school teachers in various places have been engaged in education for more than ten years, focusing on the great development of students' academic studies. They not only do not compete for personal fame and gain, but also adhere to their posts in the current extremely difficult life of teachers. Such personnel should be supported in today's deteriorating social atmosphere in our country, and the school authorities must guarantee their minimum livelihood of clean poverty and self-preservation. However, it has been found that in general private schools, the employment of teachers is completely based on the private friendship of the principal or certain vested interests. That is, a part of the teachers who have already been hired, whether they are re-hired or not, is not determined by their teaching performance, so that those who have dedicated themselves to education for life are worried about their lives in the next semester. This situation is not only common in private schools, but also in some public schools. Moreover, in today's society, there are too many people everywhere. Among them, a part of people with no experience are simply filling the ranks due to the principal's personal relationship, while a group of teachers who have made sufficient contributions to the education circle are dismissed without reason, which has a profound impact on the education cause. In addition to issuing a telegram to all national secondary schools that they must not dismiss teachers without reason and that employment letters should be issued two months before the start of the semester, it has also issued a special telegram to the education departments of various provinces and cities to be effectively responsible for the management of teacher employment and to forward it to the principals of public and private elementary and secondary schools in each county for notification.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Education Management Issues</h3>
<p>Resolved by the Second Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>According to confirmed information: the issue of the domestic and foreign overseas Chinese education management in our country was still handled in accordance with the resolution of the 734th Executive Yuan meeting at the second provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan on June 4th of this year: "Domestic overseas Chinese education is managed by the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission assists in handling it; foreign overseas Chinese education is managed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Education assists in handling it." The division of functions and management methods: (1) Overseas Chinese education and culture are managed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are assisting agencies. (2) Domestic overseas Chinese education and culture are managed by the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is an assisting agency. (3) Overseas Chinese education facilities that involve both domestic and foreign affairs should determine the responsible agency based on the focus of their business.

(7) Laws and regulations related to overseas Chinese education and culture shall be revised separately in accordance with the above items.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Jiaotong University Professors Sign Letter to Retain President Wu Baofeng; Hang Liwu Reportedly to Preside Over the Reorganization of Jiaotong University Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] President Wu Baofeng of National Jiaotong University has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education. Over a hundred university professors, including Qiu Weiyu, Zhou Ming, Chen Shiying, Zhong Weicheng, Kang Shiqing, Li Taiyun, and Zhong Zhaolin, signed a letter to retain President Wu, citing his significant contributions and efforts to the university's affairs over the years. The original letter is as follows: "To President Wu Baofeng: We have recently heard of your intention to retire and that you have repeatedly submitted your resignation to the Ministry of Education. We are extremely surprised by this news. We recall that since Shanghai fell into enemy hands, our university's history was almost at its end. Fortunately, you managed to painstakingly operate in the rear, establishing a branch school and expanding it into a full university. The number of students even doubled compared to the past. After the victory of the War of Resistance, our university's restoration was the fastest in the country, and the buildings and equipment of the Shanghai campus were preserved. For the past year, you have diligently maintained the university amidst extreme financial difficulties and strived to reorganize it, which has deeply inspired all faculty and students. In recent months, student movements have surged across the country, and our university has also been caught in the vortex. Fortunately, your steady leadership has gradually quelled the situation. You have endured hardships for many years. Now that the university has restored order, it would be a wise move for you to retire for your own sake. However, for the sake of the university's future, at a time when all university affairs need to be actively promoted and reorganized, we need your leadership and continued efforts. We feel lost and disoriented at the sudden loss of your leadership. We urge you to prioritize the university and dismiss your intention to resign. We, your colleagues, would be extremely fortunate, and the university would be extremely fortunate. We respectfully wish you well."</p>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency Report] According to news from Jiaotong University, President Wu Baofeng is determined to resign and has stopped coming to the university to work. University affairs require immediate attention. The Ministry of Education has specially dispatched Vice Minister Hang Liwu to Shanghai to preside over the reorganization of the university's affairs and to form a reorganization committee, with Hang serving as the chairman. Jiaotong University alumni Mao Yisheng, Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengyu, and Dean Qiu, along with Jiaotong University Dean of Academic Affairs Li Xidie, are also members of the committee. However, Hang did not mention this when he received reporters yesterday. Vice Minister Hang receives reporters in this city.

<h3>A Ginkgo Tree Presented to American University</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] Diplomatic sources report that the private University of Southern California in Los Angeles has a long history and has always treated our international students very well. Our government previously awarded a medal to the university's president, Dr. Clarence Deninger, and established five Chinese literature scholarships at the university. We have recently learned that our Consul General in Los Angeles, Jiang Yisheng, presented a ginkgo tree, which was transported by air from China, to the university on the 12th of last month to promote goodwill.</p>
<h3>Kunming Normal School Once Adopted a Trimester System</h3>
<p>Zha Liangzhao Talks Upon Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zha Liangzhao, President of National Kunming Normal College, flew from Kunming to Beijing at the beginning of the month to attend the Far East Basic Education Preparatory Conference and the Education Problems Symposium. He has now completed his official duties and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. He is currently residing at the home of his younger brother, President Zha Liangju. Zha told reporters yesterday that Kunming Normal College was established last summer. Because many famous professors from Southwest Associated University stayed to teach, the college was able to inherit the excellent traditions of Southwest Associated University. The students' level is also quite ideal. The college's progress has been greatly aided by the full cooperation of local people. After its establishment, the college implemented a "trimester system" to take advantage of Kunming's spring-like climate throughout the year. However, the Ministry of Education believes that this matter is related to the school system and requires further study. Therefore, the college will still adopt a "semester system" this year. The trial implementation of the trimester system may have to be restored next year. It is reported that Zha will stay for a few more days and will fly back to Kunming from Shanghai this Thursday (the 24th).</p>

There are eleven events, with each side sending two participants for each event. The list of events is as follows:</p>

<p>[Another Report] The China Youth Team practiced at the Shanghai Race Club Pool yesterday. Xu Heng and Yang Xixiu were both present. After practice, Liang Zhaoan told the Guoguang News Agency reporter that although the two sides' results were very close, the pool was only 100 feet long, which did not meet the competition standards, and the pool was small and the light was poor. (The bottom could not be seen clearly.) The China Youth Team members were not used to it, while the US military practiced here every day. Therefore, the China Youth Team will naturally suffer a lot in this competition. He also said that the pool was small and could not accommodate spectators, so it would not be open to the public at that time.</p>

<h3>Wide Disparity Between Domestic and Foreign Prices Threatens Tung Oil Production and Sales</h3>
<p>American Countries are Actively Increasing the Production of Linseed Oil</p>
<p>The United States and South American countries are actively improving the cultivation of tung trees and the processing and manufacturing of linseed oil to replace tung oil. It is generally believed that this will pose a great threat to the sales of tung oil in our country.</p>
<p>According to tung oil dealers, our country's tung oil is currently unable to be exported. The domestic price has risen to over 600,000 yuan per ton, while the foreign price is only over 200,000 yuan per ton, a huge difference, making it impossible to trade. The Central Trust Bureau has now announced that it will purchase at a market price of 620,000 yuan, but this is not a long-term solution. The United States and South America are the countries with the highest production of linseed oil in the world. In the past, South America sold as many as 120,000 tons of linseed oil in ten transactions, which shows the abundance of its production.</p>
<p>However, linseed oil is inferior to tung oil in the manufacture of paint. To manufacture fine paint, tung oil is still needed. Our country is the country with the highest production of tung oil. It is not impossible to increase the production of tung oil in our country, but no one plans to increase production, and its output is decreasing year by year. Before the war, more than 100,000 tons could be exported every year, but after the war, only more than 28,000 tons were exported last year, earning 27 million US dollars in foreign exchange, which is very different from before the war.</p>
<p>This year's exports have increased slightly. From January to April, 30,000 tons have been exported. With the Central Trust Bureau's purchase, some can still be exported, but it still cannot catch up with the pre-war level. Therefore, to strengthen production and sales and compete for the foreign market, the government must appoint a special commissioner to plan the overall strategy, otherwise the future of tung oil production and sales is unlikely to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rate Has Decreased Significantly, Capital Flight Gradually Returns</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the situation in the north, there has been a large-scale flight of capital in the country. Huge amounts of capital from the Northeast and Tianjin have been concentrated in Shanghai, and then smuggled to Hong Kong via Guangzhou and Xiamen. At the same time, a large amount of cash has been smuggled to South China, causing a great shortage of financial resources in North China, and a cash panic has occurred in this city. The exchange rate from Shanghai to Guangzhou and Xiamen has been raised by state-owned banks to a maximum of 95 yuan per thousand yuan. Commercial banks are as high as 150 yuan, and the black market exchange rate is even more alarming, once reaching 360 yuan.</p>
<p>According to information from the Central Bank, since the domestic situation has stabilized, the flight of capital has stopped, and there are signs of returning along the original route. Therefore, the amount of remittances to Guangdong has decreased sharply in recent days, and the black market exchange rate has also decreased significantly. It is currently almost the same as the exchange rate of state-owned banks, and remittances to Tianjin have increased instead.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that cash premiums have occurred in Guangzhou's oilfields and other places in South China. At its peak, 100 million yuan in cash could be exchanged for as much as 134 million yuan. Therefore, merchants in this city are carrying huge amounts of cash out of the country in various ways to make profits. Therefore, the financial authorities have strictly restricted remittances from this city to Guangdong and Fujian provinces.</p>
<p>However, merchants are profiting from cash arbitrage, and to avoid the authorities' attention, they have changed their routes. One route is from Shanghai to Hankou and then to Hengyang, and the other route is from Shanghai to Kunming and then to Wuzhou, and then concentrated in Guangzhou for operation.</p>
<p>It is reported that the authorities have stipulated that the exchange between Shanghai and Hankou shall not exceed 50 million yuan per week in order to further restrict this special transaction. If there is a legitimate use and the amount exceeds this figure, application procedures must be completed for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Silk Reeling Loan Approved by the Four Banks Joint Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the loan for cocoon purchasing this spring has been completed. A total of about 200,000 dan of fresh cocoons have been collected in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and northern Anhui. The Silk Guidance Committee believes that raw silk is urgently needed for reeling at present. After submitting to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and sending a letter to the Four Banks Joint Office, it is estimated that about 14,000 dan of raw silk can be made from 200,000 cocoons. It is calculated that about 6 million yuan is required for the reeling labor cost for each cocoon of raw silk, and a loan of 84 billion yuan is requested, which has recently been approved by the Four Banks Joint Office.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar's Promotion in Southeast Asia Achieves Great Success</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] In order to cooperate with the national policy and encourage exports to earn foreign exchange, the Resources Committee ordered its affiliated agency, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, to select high-quality cane sugar for export to foreign countries for promotion. After consultation, 200 metric tons of special grade granulated sugar were shipped on the Taikoo Yangxing Fuzhou wheel on the 17th of last month, with 100 tons each to Java and Singapore for trial sales. The selling price was US$500 per metric ton, or US$0.22 per pound, which was a complete success. It is learned that Singapore has re-ordered 100 metric tons, which the company has entrusted to the original wheel to be shipped directly to the area from Keelung on the 19th of this month. It is reported that sugar is needed everywhere in Southeast Asia. When Taiwan sugar was transported for the first time, it was welcomed for its quality, packaging and weight, and it was considered to be the same as the best products produced in Java before the war. Moreover, the area suffered heavily from the war, and the sugarcane fields and factories were severely damaged. They had not yet recovered. Taiwan sugar was considered to be a rare commodity in the past five years. In order to maintain the international market, Taiwan Sugar Corporation takes the export of fine products as a principle. Products such as cotton and white are all rejected. In order to encourage promotion, exporters who are interested in operating are also welcome, and they plan to sell a large amount of new products after they are launched at the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Purchases Old Tea, Tea Merchants Ask to Raise the Purchase Price</h3>
<p>Planning to Send Four Representatives to Petition in the Capital</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of 70,000 boxes of old tea last year by the Central Trust Bureau, the bureau had previously approved the purchase price for Qimen tea as 720,000 yuan per dan. However, the tea merchants asked the responsible authorities to raise the purchase price without success. They have submitted documents to the Executive Yuan and other relevant ministries and courts a few days ago, listing the difficulties and requesting a review.</p>
<p>The tea merchants requested an increase of 50% based on the price approved by the Central Trust Bureau, because the tea market has been prosperous recently, and the prices of all grades of tea have risen by 20-30%. Therefore, the actual price difference between the two parties is about 30%. The China Tea Export Industry will hold a general meeting at the beginning of the week and plans to send four representatives to petition in the capital.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai and Longhai Railways Allocate Cars to Transport Northwest Cotton</h3>
<p>In order to solve the cotton shortage in this city, China Textile Corporation has recently decided to purchase a large amount of cotton from the cotton-producing areas in the northwest to meet the urgent needs. The company has obtained the approval of the Ministry of Transportation to order the Beijing-Shanghai and Longhai Railways to allocate 500 tons of freight cars for the exclusive use of transporting cotton. The special train set off from Shanghai to the northwest a few days ago. According to the person in charge of China Textile Corporation, the first batch of northwest cotton will arrive in this city in half a month. After that, the special train can travel back and forth twice a month, and 1,000 tons of cotton can be supplied to the textile industry in this city every month.</p>
<h3>Assisting Transportation, Public Utilities and Other Enterprises, Traffic Bank's Work Situation, A Large Number of Loans Were Issued in the 35th Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to regulations, the main professional business of the Bank of Communications is to assist in the recovery and expansion of transportation, public utilities, and industrial and mining production. The details of the bank's handling of this professional business in the 35th year are described below:</p>
<p>Assisting Transportation Enterprises</p>
<p>In the past, during the Anti-Japanese War, the transportation situation in the rear was relatively backward, and the objects of assistance were also relatively few. After the victory, major railways and shipping lines in the recovered areas, as well as air transport, were actively restored. The bank did its best to provide loans. As for railways, there are Jinpu, Pinghan, Yuehan, Longhai, Xiangguizhou, Beining, and Zhongchang roads. Almost all of the main lines in the country are included, and the total amount of loans for the whole year reached tens of billions of yuan. In terms of highways, in addition to assisting the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation in repairing various roads, private long-distance bus companies purchased vehicles and restored passenger and freight transportation on various roads, which was also the goal of the bank's efforts. The total amount of loans for the whole year also reached more than 10 billion yuan. In terms of ships, such as assisting shipping companies to purchase ships, salvage sunken ships, and temporarily lending shipping companies working capital to promote the rapid recovery of the shipping industry, the total amount reached more than 14 billion yuan. There are not many objects in the aviation industry, and the loans are relatively small, with the 1.1 billion yuan of the Central Airlines being a large number.</p>
<p>Assisting Public Utilities</p>
<p>Regarding public utilities, the most important in our country's current situation is the power industry. Power is the mother of all industries and the foundation of people's livelihood. Over the past year, loans have been given to working capital and assistance in expanding the purchase of machinery and other items, including the electricity industry in major cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Hankou, Nanchang, Jinan, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Lanxi, Wenzhou, Wuchang, Zhenjiang, Bengbu, Wuhu, Yichang, and Chengdu, totaling more than 7 billion yuan. In addition, more than 2 billion yuan was loaned to assist the water supply business in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Chengdu and other places in purchasing machinery and materials. In addition, the bank assisted in the purchase of automobiles and machinery for urban transportation, sewage docks, ferries, etc., with a total amount of more than 9 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Supporting Industrial and Mining Production</p>
<p>The support for industrial and mining production is mainly focused on four items directly related to the people's livelihood: the textile and dyeing industry, the food industry, the chemical industry, and the mining industry. The textile and dyeing industry includes cotton, silk, and wool. The food industry is mainly the flour industry. The chemical industry is mainly the basic chemical industry and the chemical products industry. The mining industry is mainly the coal mining industry. In particular, the textile and dyeing industry has a longer history and scale in my country's current industry, so the loan figures are also larger, totaling more than 70 billion yuan. In order to adapt to the social and economic situation and consider the urgency of needs, the loan figures are the largest for the cotton spinning industry, followed by the silk weaving industry, and then the wool weaving industry. All large and small cities in the country, from yarn factories with tens of thousands of spindles to handicrafts related to the people's livelihood, have been assisted as much as possible if they meet the loan conditions.</p>
<p>At the same time, various aspects have been given to support silk cocoons and silk weaving. The bank participated in or mainly handled spring cocoon loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to assist in cocoon collection, support cocoon farmers, increase production, and loan to the Shanghai silk weaving industry, the Hangzhou silk weaving industry, and the silk business. In terms of the food industry, the total amount of loans reached more than 20 billion yuan, mostly for the flour industry. In addition to collateralizing raw materials and finished products, during the wheat season, advances were used to assist in purchasing raw materials in the production area, in order to ensure that the funds were actually used for purchasing materials and producing. The chemical industry is next, with a total amount of more than 10 billion yuan. Because the chemical industry is not yet popular in my country's industrial sector, in addition to providing as much assistance as possible to larger chemical industries, general small factories and other chemical daily necessities manufacturers are also supported.</p>
<p>In other industrial fields, such as cement, oil refining, leather making, rubber, auto parts, and building materials, loans were also provided. As for mining loans, they reached more than 20 billion yuan. The coal-producing areas in the country, such as Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces, as well as larger coal mines, such as Zhongxing, Kailuan, Huainan, Henan Minsheng, and Sichuan Tianfu, have dealings. In the northeastern region, lending operations to assist in reconstruction and promote production forces are also being gradually carried out. In summary, the total outstanding amount of loans to transportation, industry, mining, and public utilities throughout the year, as of the end of the year, totaled more than 150.9 billion yuan, accounting for 72% of the total amount of loans, which shows that the bank has spared no effort in supporting transportation, public utilities, and industrial and mining production, and has also barely met its professional mission.</p>
<p>As for other businesses, they are (1) assisting in smoothing the flow of materials; (2) handling special businesses assigned by the government; (3) smoothing domestic and foreign exchange business; (4) managing foreign exchange on behalf of the government; (5) adjusting branch institutions; (6) savings business; (7) promoting trust business</p>
<p>Assisting in Smoothing the Flow of Materials</p>
<p>This year, in order to cooperate with the government's policy of smoothing the flow of materials and stabilizing prices, the bank actively promoted domestic inter-port collateral business in accordance with the collateral principles set by the Four Banks Joint Office, and provided as much import and export collateral as possible for manufacturers who purchased local products from various places for import and sold local products for export. Those who need to finance funds during the packaging period are also given appropriate assistance. During the cotton production season this year, in order to assist various manufacturers in purchasing cotton in the producing areas, cotton purchase collateral business was also handled. As for exporters who need financial accommodation to search for materials in the mainland and transport them abroad, they will be given assistance in accordance with the regulations for export materials that have been exchanged at the bank. As of the end of this year, more than 120 billion yuan has been processed for inter-port collateral business, more than 20 billion yuan for cotton purchase collateral business, and more than 30 billion yuan for export of foreign materials. However, because domestic transportation is not smooth, the results are still not satisfactory, and it still needs the joint efforts of all parties.</p>
<p>Government-Assigned Business</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, prices in the rear areas plummeted, which led to the inability of the industry to maintain its costs, and work was suspended one after another. The government urgently sought relief and designated the bank to cooperate with China, Zhongnong, and Zhongxin banks and other banks to handle emergency industrial loans in the rear areas. This year, the bank continued to handle cases from the previous year for factories that have not yet received this loan, and the rear industry relied on it to barely overcome difficulties. As of the end of the previous year, the bank had undertaken more than 1.1 billion yuan, and this year it has loaned out more than 52 million yuan successively. At the same time, it also undertook reconstruction loans in the recovered areas to assist in the resumption of business of industry and mining in the recovered areas. The bank has loaned a total of more than 5.9 billion yuan. In addition, in order to assist overseas Chinese in resuming business, the Ministry of Finance formulated measures for overseas Chinese to resume business loans, which were handled by the bank and the China Development Bank. The funds were shared by the Central China and the bank. The loan area is divided into five areas. The bank undertook the Philippine and Myanmar regions, and the Philippine region was entrusted by the bank to the Philippine Bank of Communications, which is currently negotiating with the local consulate. The Myanmar region has been handled by the bank's Yangon branch. Overseas Chinese who applied for loans were very enthusiastic, and about 2 million shields have been released.</p>
<p>Smoothing Domestic and Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the victory, branches in the recovered areas have actively resumed business, and the exchange business has expanded day by day. Regarding domestic exchange, at the beginning of the restoration, the funds in the recovered areas relied on the allocation from the rear areas, but at that time, transportation was not smooth and the transportation of vouchers was difficult. The bank concentrated the adjustment and concentration of exchange funds in important places where industry and commerce were prosperous and funds were solved, and set up an exchange fund to plan for its smoothness. On the one hand, import and export collateral are used to mutually regulate. In July of this year, the national bank was to stabilize prices in Shanghai and manage exchange applications in various places. The bank cooperated in the implementation and strictly limited the acceptance of exchange applications by various places. The number of accepted exchanges was allocated based on the legitimate needs of industry and commerce, so that the intention of smoothness was still included in the restriction.</p>
<p>In summary, the total amount of exchange business of various banks and offices throughout the year has increased by more than 1.4 trillion yuan compared with the victory before. As for overseas remittances, the bank formulated measures to restore overseas remittances at the beginning of the victory. In India. The bank's original institutions continued to receive remittances. In the Philippines, after the US military recovered it, it was entrusted to the Philippine Bank of Communications, and the institutions in Vietnam and Myanmar were also restored successively.</p>
<p>In summary, the bulk of overseas remittances received are remitted to Fujian and Guangdong. On the one hand, institutions have been added in areas where overseas relatives are concentrated, and on the other hand, the procedures for receiving and resolving remittances have been simplified as much as possible. After the foreign exchange market was opened in March of this year and the US dollar exchange rate was raised, overseas remittances increased significantly. However, later, due to the exchange rate, overseas remittances gradually declined. Although the US dollar exchange rate was raised again in August, the number of remittances received still showed little improvement.</p>
<p>The total amount of overseas remittances received throughout the year, combined with national currency, was 4.55 billion yuan, including 3.87 billion yuan in the Philippines and 670 million yuan in India and Myanmar.</p>
<p>Handling Foreign Exchange Management on Behalf of the Government</p>
<p>In March of this year, the government announced measures for foreign exchange and import and export trade management, authorizing the Central Bank to temporarily manage foreign exchange tasks, and stipulating that designated banks may operate foreign exchange. The bank is one of the designated banks, and the foreign exchange management center is in Shanghai, so the Shanghai branch first operated foreign exchange transactions in accordance with the foreign exchange management measures. Later, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shantou, Jiangmen, Wuzhou, Qingdao and other places successively undertook it. In addition to purchasing foreign exchange, all sales of foreign exchange are limited to uses that comply with regulations. Regarding foreign currency deposits, they were legally stopped when the foreign exchange management measures were implemented. As of September 30, the foreign currency deposits that had been made in various banks and offices had been converted into national currency according to the balance, and the bank sold them to the Central Bank in British and American gold separately. In November, the provisional measures for import and export trade were revised, and import permits must be applied for before import. Except for the application for goods in categories 1, 3 and 2 in Annexes 1, 3 and 2 in Shanghai, which are priced at less than US$2,000, which can be handled by designated banks. All other import applications must be approved by the Import Association. At the same time, the registration of importers was processed and the foreign exchange business was settled, which was temporarily stagnant. As for export exchange settlement, due to the imbalance between the exchange rate and the domestic and foreign cost prices, although there were some undertakings, the number was not large (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Five County Cloth Factory Industry Friendship Association Held Third Meeting in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The third meeting of the Suzhou-Yuxi-Wuxi-Cheng-Wu Five County Cloth Factory Industry Friendship Association was held in Suzhou today. A total of 26 representatives from Gu County attended. Many important cases were decided: (1) Apply to the Textile Adjustment Committee to increase the amount of yarn allocated, and stipulate that it should be allocated and sold twice a month. (2) Apply for production loans to the Four Banks Joint Office. (5) Request the PetroChina Company to allocate diesel to maintain production. (4) The next meeting is scheduled to be held in Wujin on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Association Proposes Revaluation, Preparing for Property Valuation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Money Industry Association recently believes that the valuation of the reserve property paid by members to the Silver Money Industry Joint Reserve Association has not been revalued for a long time, resulting in the originally set price being too low compared to the current market price. There is a saying that it will be re-adjusted and revalued.</p>
<h3>Zhangzhou Litchi Sees New</h3>
<p>The first batch of new dried litchi from Zhangzhou arrived in small quantities yesterday. Because the cost is relatively high, actual sales are hesitant and prices may not be very good.</p>
<h3>This Year's Yarn and Cloth Production Can Reach 2 Million Pieces</h3>
<p>Estimated that 1 Million Pieces of Cotton Yarn Can Be Exported</p>
<p>The authorities will use the total amount of yarn and cloth produced by state-owned and private yarn factories across the country last year to supply domestic needs, and export the increased quantity this year.</p>
<p>According to an expert from the textile industry, if the news is true, the amount of cotton yarn available for export this year will increase significantly. According to the production of cotton yarn in various branches last year, state-owned enterprises produced about 460,000 pieces, and private factories produced about 600,000 pieces. The total production was no more than 1 million pieces.</p>
<p>It is estimated that state-owned factories can produce about 800,000 pieces this year, and private factories can produce about 1.2 million pieces. The total production is estimated to reach about 2 million pieces, then the cotton yarn for export is estimated to be about 1 million pieces.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Conditions</h3>
<p>It is heard that a large number of fir trees are shipped from Fujian to Shanghai. The market atmosphere has changed from firm to flat, and there are occasional forward sales. The market atmosphere of foreign pine is weak.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Source is Scarce, Affecting Soap Factory Production, The Industry is Eagerly Awaiting Active Assistance from the Government</h3>
<p>The important raw material caustic soda required by my country's soap industry has always been purchased from countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, especially from the United States, and the supply of domestic caustic soda only accounts for a small part.</p>
<p>Since the Import Control Committee restricted the amount of foreign exchange, the source of foreign goods has been greatly reduced, and the raw materials for the soap-making industry are increasingly depleted, affecting production. The relevant authorities have tried their best to give the industry priority in the supply of caustic soda, but it is still a drop in the bucket and difficult to solve the problem. According to the current production situation of the 40 factories in the industry, at least 700,000 kilograms of caustic soda are required per month.</p>
<p>It is learned that in the first half of the 36th year, the caustic soda raw materials allocated to the industry included 50 barrels of Yongli caustic soda (300 kilograms per barrel) allocated by Yongli Chemical Factory in March, at a price of 4.8 million yuan per barrel. In April, 300 bags of Yongli soda ash (80 kilograms per bag) were allocated, at a price of 150,000 yuan per bag. In May, 50 barrels of Yongli caustic soda were allocated, at 6.4 million yuan per barrel, and 400 bags of Yongli soda ash were allocated, at 400,000 yuan per bag. In June, 97 barrels of Taiwan Lighthouse brand caustic soda were allocated by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, at 5.6 million yuan per barrel. The above-mentioned allocated raw materials were allocated to all members by the industry association according to the production ratio. However, because the sales price at that time was not lower than the market price, some members voluntarily gave up. The larger factories, in order to take into account the future allocation rights, bought all of them.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, the allocation situation like this does not provide active assistance to the industry. Soap is a necessity for people's daily life and one of the important industries. Therefore, they are eagerly awaiting strong assistance from the government and various competent authorities, so that the future of my country's soap industry can be developed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Plywood Industry</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office on the general situation of the plywood industry in Shanghai, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>I. Overview: There are seven plywood factories in the city, namely Xiangtai, Yicheng, Fenghuang, Jingyi, Shanghai, Qiming, and Yangzi. Xiangtai and Yicheng were established in 1927 and 1928 respectively. (At that time, Xiangtai was run by the British-owned China Timber Import and Export Company). This marked the beginning of the plywood manufacturing industry in Shanghai. In the first two or three years, the products were only used for packing tea for export from China, so the equipment at that time was relatively small. Later, due to the development of the business and the expansion of the use of plywood, the furniture and construction industries adopted it, so the equipment was expanded to produce large 3x6 or larger plywood sheets. And factories such as Fenghuang, Jingyi, Shanghai, Qiming and Yangzi were established one after another. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the factories were forced by the environment to suspend operations one after another. Only the Qiming and Yangzi factories run by the Japanese continued to manufacture. After the victory, the factories actively resumed production, and now all seven factories are in operation.</p>
<p>II. Equipment: The factory sites of each factory are located where there is water access to the Huangpu River for the convenience of transporting the main raw material, round timber. The main equipment includes peeling machines, cutting machines, drying machines, gluing machines, cold pressing machines, hot pressing machines, drying rooms, horizontal and vertical edge cutting machines, planing machines, and sanding machines. Among the seven companies, Xiangtai has the most complete equipment, suitable layout, and larger output. The existing equipment of each factory cannot be fully utilized due to the lack of raw materials. The number of machines and the number of machines in use in each of the seven factories are listed as follows: Planing machines: 7 units, 6 units; Sanding machines: 1 unit, 1 unit.</p>
<p>III. Products: Various plywood, such as three-ply, five-ply, and seven-ply, but the output of 3x6 three-ply is the largest, because it is the most needed in the market.</p>
<p>IV. Output: In terms of output, according to the equipment matching situation of each factory, the maximum output and the current output are listed as follows (calculated based on 3x6 three-plywood):</p>
<p>V. Raw Materials: The main raw materials for manufacturing plywood are Lauan wood, casein powder, caustic soda, soda ash, and goods bean powder.</p>
<p>VI. Conclusion: At present, the domestic plywood industry has occupied an important position in the construction, furniture, and decoration industries. The current monthly output is about 100,000 sheets, which is not enough to meet the needs of the market. In order to increase production, the raw materials needed by the industry, such as Lauan wood, casein powder, and caustic soda, in terms of domestic products (although Lauan can be replaced by domestic pine, the output is not enough) cannot be supplied in large quantities. In the past, in order to maintain the production of the industry, temporary import was unavoidable.</p>
<p>It is found that wood is the most important raw material in plywood manufacturing, accounting for four-fifths of the total price of raw materials. The domestic production of local timber should be planned as soon as possible so that it can be fully supplied by itself and no longer rely on foreign sources. It is urgently needed to improve logging machinery and equipment, transportation, so as to increase output, and cultivate forests to ensure a permanent and continuous supply.</p>
<h3>Affected by Soaring Prices, Summer Woolens Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>After mid-summer, worsted woolens woven from fine wool have seen their retail and wholesale prices rise due to the issuance of fire banknotes and the impact of soaring prices. Woolen merchants are following the lead of the manufacturers, and are competing to purchase during periods of rising market prices. Actual sales of melton have largely fallen behind, but its price has also risen considerably, demonstrating the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai. In terms of actual sales, both Chinese and Western clothing fabrics are strong, with high-end woolens from afar selling more actively than lower-end goods.</p>
<p>Mid-summer woolen prices continue to rise. People in the industry predict that the market will inevitably rise further, mainly because orders are difficult to place and manufacturers' production costs are high and gradually decreasing. Relying solely on Hong Kong re-exports and smuggled goods being shipped to Shanghai is like a drop in the bucket, and will not solve the problem. At the same time, the price of rice has exceeded 400,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and the prices of various goods have risen in a straight line, which is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Woolens continue to rise in price steadily in late summer, becoming even more intense after mid-month. Except for summer goods such as poplin and valeting, which are slightly weaker due to seasonal sales, most goods have risen across the board. This is mainly because transportation and public utilities have soared first, and various goods have followed suit. Rice prices have risen to 500,000 yuan, and the prices of various commodities such as silk yarn, silk cloth, cigarettes, soap, and vegetables have jumped one after another. Woolens cannot be an exception. And the high cost of shipping from Hong Kong and falling cargo prices are also a reason. The cost of making Western suits has been affected by the de-freezing of the cost of living index, and the cost of making each suit has risen across the board, with prices of 1.2 million to 2 million yuan being quoted. Zhanghua flannel is currently sold at 350,000 to 360,000 yuan per yard in the market, while the manufacturer's fixed price is 400,000 yuan, with 70% of the purchase price required in foreign currency.</p>
<p>The standard market prices of woolens for the three months of early, mid, and late summer are listed below for reference: The following are all wholesale prices per yard, in yuan.</p>

<h3>Wei Daoming's Inspection Tour - Accompanying Notes</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Mu Yun</p>
<p>Taipei, 17th Airmail</p>
<p>Traversing 500 Kilometers of Western Taiwan</p>
<p>From July 12th to 17th, this reporter accompanied Chairman Wei, Director Zhu Foding, Chief of Staff Niu Xianming, and others on an inspection tour, traveling 500 kilometers through eleven large and small counties and cities in western Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan Island is currently in its hottest season. After crossing the Tropic of Cancer in Chiayi, one cannot wipe away the beads of perspiration. The scenery along the weaving routes is familiar to this reporter. We breathe in the aroma of freshly tilled soil after the first rice crop has been harvested. Old farmers wearing bamboo hats drive water buffalo to plow the fields. The lychee orchards are quiet and peaceful. Mangoes and longans can be picked along the way... The fields truly complement the misty mountains and the low, red farmhouses. Taiwan is as lovely as Jiangnan, and as worthy of love as the Southern Country!</p>
<p>When Chairman Wei and his party were on the recovered land of the motherland, experiencing the prosperous region under their management and interacting with honest and progressive people, they must have felt an unusual excitement in their hearts!</p>
<p>Shadows, Smallpox, Bacteria</p>
<p>Deep shadows of the February 28th Incident still remain. These shadows are truly unfortunate wounds. The Taiwanese people have not forgotten the disasters they brought. They now have only one hope: lenient treatment and a quick resolution! This is under a major premise: the principal offenders must be brought to justice, and the accomplices and suspects must be released as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Chairman Wei said optimistically that this was just a misunderstanding, and misunderstandings can be resolved through understanding. Because he firmly believes that the Taiwanese are genuine Chinese, sharing the same Chinese blood, customs, and habits. People from both inside and outside the province are compatriots. He cited the situation in the Sichuan and Chongqing areas in the early days of the War of Resistance to illustrate that emotional breakdowns only lead to greater affection. In the past year and a half, the Taiwanese people have made great progress in learning Mandarin. They can speak in Mandarin, and some can even give short speeches. Chairman Wei also hopes to be able to express his political views in Taiwanese a year from now, breaking through the language barrier.</p>
<p>After all, the February 28th Incident was a painful event. Even now, the true inside story has not been revealed. The staff at all levels are still not energetic, as if they have lost their elasticity. Some people mistakenly believe that it was a "May Fourth Movement" on the island, or even a "revolutionary movement." But regardless, it is the best lesson for the new provincial government. It uses blood, tears, and the anger of life to indicate the road signs of governance. It is hoped that this shadow can disappear immediately and the wounds can be healed quickly. Some people say that February 28th may be smallpox, but it cannot become bacteria. In Kaohsiung and Fengshan, this reporter saw elderly men with white hair wearing long gowns and vests. Fifty years of foreign subjugation could not eliminate the image of ancient China, only strengthen their patriotic centripetal force. The Taiwanese compatriots will never deny that they are 10/10 Chinese!</p>
<p>Visiting Lin Xiantang in Wufeng, Taichung</p>
<p>Wherever Chairman Wei went, he was the object of visits and interviews by the public, senators, subordinates, and mountain compatriots, as well as to catch a glimpse of his appearance. The exception was a visit to Provincial Government Committee Member Lin Xiantang, which took place on the morning of the 13th at the Lin residence in Wufeng.</p>
<p>The Lin residence is a palace-style courtyard with red and green colors depicting the old era. It has the same atmosphere as the Lin Benyuan Garden in Banqiao: quaint and charming. Mr. Lin has white hair and a bald head, but is full of energy. He is an elder who owns over 150 jia (one jia equals fifteen mu) and has three generations living under one roof. He is a representative of the landlord class.</p>
<p>During the February 28th Incident, Lin Xiantang acted as a protector for Yan Jiagan, the director of the Department of Finance. Not only did he not participate in the incident, but he also directly helped the people from other provinces. His firm performance was successful when Minister Bai arrived in Taiwan! In fact, he is an authority among the 6.3 million people, a gentleman in a leading position. He can and must sacrifice the small self to complete the larger self. However, in the recent debate over the purchase of surplus grain at government-set prices, he stood solely on the interests of the landlords, rejecting the theories and actual figures of the Food Bureau, and insisted on raising prices. As a result, he was ultimately defeated by the opposition of the majority of the people, and the price of 27.5 yuan per kilogram was passed. Mr. Lin was utterly defeated!</p>
<p>Wufeng has had a glorious history. Liang Qichao once visited it, and Duan Qirui's inscription still hangs in the hall, making people feel like they have entered a noble family in Suzhou. As we left this small town, we were pondering this question: "If Taiwan Province were to implement popular elections, would the provincial chairman be Lin Xiantang?"</p>
<p>Re-Dividing Administrative Regions Sparks Disputes</p>
<p>At the Provincial Government meeting, Lin Xiantang made a suggestion to revise the local administrative regions. The main points are: (1) Reduce the size of the counties to simplify and facilitate official communication; (2) Make popular elections easier; (3) Eliminate district offices. That is, change the current eight counties and nine cities in the province into twenty-two counties! This is just a suggestion, and the provincial government needs to consider this administrative reorganization, which is too extensive, in the long term. However, this suggestion alone has caused a great reaction. The majority of people unanimously argue that the unreasonable small county system has long been abolished in advanced countries and can no longer be applied today. However, because the restoration time was too short, the authorities failed to deliberate on it in the long term, resulting in some unreasonable phenomena. Even if corrections are made immediately, it will not be easy!</p>
<p>Senator Hong Yuanhuang of Hecheng said: The re-division of administrative regions and the determination of county and city locations cannot be determined solely by personal subjectivity. He said passionately: Why does Taichung City, which has a superior environment, not have a county seat, but allow the government of 1.2 million people to be forced to Yuanlin, which is remote, low-lying, and lacks facilities, so that civil servants run back and forth every day? And the original buildings are abandoned?</p>
<p>More Than a Month of Torrential Rain Causes Disaster</p>
<p>Taiwan is a disaster-prone area. Typhoons, rain, earthquakes, rapids, and sandy soil cause the greatest damage to construction. More than a month of heavy rain has caused disasters in the south. The steel frame of the 46-meter-long Dadu River Bridge, which was washed away, is still being sucked by the muddy stream. The edge of the Wu River still has a broken mouth. Taichung County has suffered the worst flood in 20 years. More than 40 embankment breaches have occurred, farmland has been turned into ruins, and the people are shouting for relief and repairs. The emergency repair cost for the disaster in the Da'an and Dajia rivers, which was jointly undertaken by the government and the people, is 2 million yuan, and the project cost requires 12 million yuan. However, complete restoration and repair require 1.1 billion yuan, which is a huge figure.</p>
<p>Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places have also suffered great disasters. Although this situation is not as bad as the Yellow River breach, in such situations the Taiwanese people often use this to test whether the government cares about the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Seventy percent of Taiwan's farmland relies on man-made water conservancy projects, with the Chianan Irrigation Canal being a representative work. Chairman Wei praised the construction of this canal. However, the Japanese built water conservancy projects and supplied farmers with increased production, but returned the profits to the Japanese. Today's government is helping with construction as much as possible and distributing the profits to the public. Construction is difficult, but maintenance and protection are even more difficult. The annual cost of water management for the entire province is 200 million to 3 billion yuan. Construction and emergency repairs in Taiwan need to proceed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for Local Construction</p>
<p>The Taiwanese people's enthusiasm for local construction is unmatched by the people in the interior. They are only afraid of not having the opportunity, and when they have the opportunity, they will never give up their right to speak, never forget their locality, and never abandon their own interests. Most of Hsinchu County is dependent on rain-fed agriculture, and they particularly hope for water conservancy construction. Hsinchu City, with 75,000 citizens, because Zhudong has a large amount of natural resources, longs for the rapid development of an industrial city. Taichung City needs to complete Anping Fishing Port in addition to the construction of a cultural city; Chiayi City is clamoring to complete a "land port."</p>
<p>In counties with abundant agricultural products, they all hope that the factories that the Allies demand as compensation can be relocated to their respective regions. They are even more urgently demanding fertilizer factories, demanding low-interest loans for reconstruction, demanding the allocation of cement and wood to genuine needs, and demanding improvement of farmers' lives.</p>
<p>Especially in Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, the gunpowder of war still leaves a strong smell on the ruins, and it is still the dilapidated scene of the early days of restoration. In the current situation, it seems that it only allows people to recall the visions of the past and the future, and only makes such dreamy and enthusiastic reveries!</p>
<p>One Direction, One Route</p>
<p>The Taiwanese people have more economic demands than political demands. The provincial government is now adopting this approach: stabilize the economy and stabilize society. After stabilizing the economy, then seek to stabilize society. The value of the Taiwan dollar has increased, and the prices of some special products have decreased or increased. After the economy is stable and prices are not volatile, then seek improvement and construction! This is a direction for progress, a route.</p>
<p>Chairman Wei, in a relaxed and sharp tone, warned the provincial people not to be superstitious about Japan and not to ignore reality. He said: "In the past world, the past China, and the past Taiwan, if we had taken over, the lives of the compatriots would certainly be better than at that time; if the present world, this China, and this Taiwan were still occupied by the Japanese, the lives of the compatriots would be even more painful and without freedom. Precisely because we are facing this extremely difficult situation, we must not close our doors and ignore the world's situation."</p>
<p>In economic policy, the new provincial government seems to have chosen a limited form of liberalism. The principle is that the government should establish, cooperate, and support the people in need, and the people need to demonstrate their strength, which is democracy!</p>
<p>Welcome Entrepreneurs to Invest</p>
<p>Chairman Wei believes that the Taiwan issue is both simple and optimistic!</p>
<p>Taiwan has a foundation in education, construction, agriculture, and industry. This foundation has been damaged by the war, and has not yet been restored. Chairman Wei promised the people of all counties and cities to quickly repair the national schools and find ways to relieve unemployment. Through his efforts to delve into the people in the heat, he has gained a clear outline of the issues surrounding the majority of Taiwanese compatriots. This is an excellent basis and reference for governance, and the distance between the past government and the people has been shortened!</p>
<p>Taiwan has a relatively stable environment, more advantageous and lower-cost power and labor than the interior, and some special products and raw materials to supply the needs of industry, flexible transportation tools, and ports. The provincial government uses both hands to reject all speculators, while smilingly welcomes large-scale enterprise investment!</p>
<p>Taiwan has already had a new starting point. This new starting point will use the power of democratic spontaneity to practically crush all the rumors and delusions of aggressors and ambitious people!</p>
<p>Currently, the Taiwanese compatriots are more rational, but they still urgently need to be warm and full, need to establish a good and normal social atmosphere, and need close cooperation in all aspects to solve the pressing problems they want to solve. They place their hopes on the new provincial government, which has been established for two months! (Photo by Mu Yun) (Photo by Mu Yun) (Photo by Mu Yun)</p>
<h3>Liu Bocheng on the Longhai Line: The Already Muddy Water of the Turbid Yellow River; The Already Suffering People of Bitter Western Shandong</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Zhengzhou, 13th (Airmail)</p>
<p>It is said that the Yellow River is a natural defense line spanning the entire country, dividing the north and south. The south is even stronger than the north because there is also the Longhai Line parallel to the river, which can be considered the second line of defense of the Yellow River. This point has already been proven by facts in the history of the War of Resistance, so there is no need to discuss it further. What I want to say now is why, from Tongguan downstream, both the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Longhai Railway are as tense as the bulging veins of an angry person. This tense situation is caused less by the imminent Yellow River flood and more by the rebellion and treachery instigated by bandits like Liu Bocheng.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Troops Ordered to Advance</p>
<p>After Liu Bocheng's failed attack on Anyang, he immediately replenished his forces, saying he would continue to attack Anyang, but secretly planning something else. Coincidentally, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) called for both sides to cease military operations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. So, he crossed the south bank of the Yellow River in the Puyang area, captured Youcheng, occupied Yuncheng, attacked Heze, assaulted Dingtao, and fled to Juye, not only muddying the already muddy waters of the Yellow River but also causing suffering to the already suffering people of western Shandong. Naturally, the eastern section of the Longhai Railway entered a state of tension. Northern Henan is an area disturbed by the Liu bandit. This time, after he attacked western Shandong, his miscellaneous troops naturally followed his lead, also fearing that they might be eliminated after their leader left, so they continued to harass everywhere. Liu Bocheng certainly knew that they were not very effective, so he relied on some Taihang Mountain bandits, such as the "New Independent 4th Brigade" and the "Independent 5th Brigade," to support him, asking them to create a disturbance in northern Henan to distract the enemy. Approximately 20,000 bandits from the Taihang Mountains infiltrated the Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Mengxian areas, causing the water of the Yellow River in this section to stir up invisibly and become artificially turbulent.</p>
<p>It is said that four brigades of Chen Geng's communist troops on both sides of the Tong-Xiao Railway have moved to Jinyang. It is also said that they want to set up a long, riverfront snake formation from west of Mengxian to Yuanqu, also wanting to stir the Yellow River water into ink black to facilitate their muddying the waters.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the border of Henan and Shaanxi along the river to the border of Henan and Shandong, both the great river and the railway are tense with bulging veins.</p>
<p>Attempt to Establish a New Base Area</p>
<p>Careless people, or those who only listen with their ears, think the communists are truly remarkable. But if one looks at Chen Yi's defeat in Shandong, where he almost had to slip to Yantai to cross the river, then Liu Bocheng's attack in western Shandong and Chen Geng's support are nothing more than desperate measures. Liu Bocheng is especially clear! Chen Yi's defeat today is Liu Bocheng's destruction tomorrow. Of course, Chen Geng is just as clear as Liu Bocheng: Liu Bocheng's destruction tomorrow is Chen Geng's demise the day after. Why is this so? When the Jinpu Railway is open, Chen Yi is finished; when the Pinghan Railway is open, Liu Bocheng is finished; when the Tongpu Railway is open, Chen Geng is also finished. Therefore, they have to pull the vertical battle line that threatens their lives onto a horizontal battle line that can save their lives.</p>
<p>According to Liu Bocheng's recent propaganda, he plans to go to the Dabie Mountains in the border area of Henan and Hubei to establish a base area, and Chen Geng also plans to cross the river and go to the Qinling Mountains in the border area of Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan to establish a base area. It is fine for Liu Bocheng to just boast like this, just as his past claim to capture Anyang in three weeks was a joke. But if they really want to do this, what will they gain besides being a scapegoat for Li Xiannian? This statement can be annotated as follows: this statement fools people, like a tiger borrowing the power of a human; this statement is an input, inputting people to see through its reality.</p>
<p>Clever Tactics: Setting Up the Han Xin Formation</p>
<p>This time, Liu Bocheng no longer attacked Anyang but changed to attacking western Shandong, not daring to confront the enemy head-on, which shows his cleverness. Because the tricks he played in Anyang were all exposed by the defending troops of Li Banqing. Some of the National Revolutionary Army in western Shandong have not yet fought against him, which can show off his skills on the one hand and prevent his troops from losing morale on the other. Whether successful or not, he is setting up the famous Han Xin formation. The only difference is that Han Xin's backwater formation did not have boats prepared at the crossing, while Liu Bocheng's backwater formation has both soldiers and boats at the crossing. Liu Bocheng's backwater formation has its strengths and weaknesses, and we must come to this conclusion. Liu Bocheng also benefits from fighting in western Shandong because the communist troops of Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou in the flood area can directly support him. It is said that they have already been partially concentrated south of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, with a generous estimate of about 10,000 men. Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou have been able to operate in the flood area because they have always relied on scattered groups of three to five hundred or one to two thousand men to cause chaos. This time, their concentration can certainly support Liu Bocheng, but this concentration also gives the National Revolutionary Army the opportunity to annihilate them! Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou's difficulties are the last thing Liu Bocheng can understand right now, and he will have to wait for the facts to tell him.</p>
<p>Decisive Battle Launched; Supply Difficult</p>
<p>When writing this dispatch, the National Revolutionary Army may already be engaged in a decisive battle with Liu Bocheng's concentrated force of 50,000 to 60,000 men between Heze, Yuncheng, and Dingtao. The result of this decisive battle will be left blank for now. This is not because there is no confidence in the judgment or because it concerns any military secrets, because the matter is too clear. If he attacks in that area this time, does he want to be drowned by the Yellow River flood in victory, or does he want to escape back to his old disturbed area of northern Henan in defeat? Running ahead of the Yellow River water, I have already explained it for him earlier. To put it more clearly, one only needs to ask where his supplies are.</p>
<p>Chen Geng's Troops Only Provide Support</p>
<p>If the communist troops in the Mengxian area, or even Chen Geng's troops, want to cross the river to cause trouble, then crossing the river with a small force will surely lead to annihilation. Crossing the river with a large force requires a large investment, but what guarantee do they have? When Li Xiannian's remnants asked Chen Geng to come and meet them, they never succeeded. Liu Bocheng has been going in and out of the area of western Shandong and is familiar with the roads, but how easy is it for Chen Geng to cross the river for the first time and come to the area of western Henan? The two or three hundred remnants in the Funiu Mountains are no match for the power of Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou in the flood area to support him. Even waving flags and shouting is too far away. To sum it up in one sentence, Chen Geng's troops are only capable of providing support and cannot form a main battle situation. If they can make the water of the Yellow River in this area look even more turbulent and rapid, then they can be considered to have accomplished their mission.</p>
<p>Naturally, there will be a tense situation on this line for a considerable period of time. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>"Restoration" No. 1 Rice Seed</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Taiwan, 18th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Branch has a well-deserved reputation for its research and improvement of agriculture in Taiwan. The branch realized that Japonica rice (called Penglai rice in Taiwan) was greatly harmed by rice blast disease. For decades, scholars from various countries had been immersed in research, but without results. After many experiments, they finally selected the K11001 strain from the Japonica rice hybrid system, which was confirmed to have significant resistance and good yield and quality. Its yield is more than four times higher than that of the Tainan 65, the most common standard variety currently grown in Taiwan. This unprecedented achievement is truly a new era in the rice breeding industry and a glorious contribution to agriculture in our country. When Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming inspected Chiayi on the 14th of this month, he specially named it the "Restoration" No. 1 rice seed, which is particularly meaningful.

<h3>Executive Yuan Announces the National Highway Network Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 18th] The Executive Yuan recently announced four measures for the National Highway Network Plan and a table of route mileage for the National Highway Network Plan. The National Highway Network Plan aims to consolidate national defense and develop the national economy. All highways that connect the capital with provincial capitals, important ports, and international passages, and that have transportation value that is widespread throughout the country or spans several provinces, should be designated as national highways and managed by the central government. The four key points of the National Highway Network Plan are as follows: (1) National Highway Routes: National highway network routes are identified by names such as "Base" and "Meridian," and are marked separately. In addition to the national highway routes in the nine northeastern provinces, Taiwan province, and Hainan Island, which will be announced separately, the following are the four Base lines, five Meridian lines, six Latitude lines, and twenty-two Meridian and Latitude connecting lines, for a total of thirty-seven lines and a total length of 57,223 kilometers (see the National Highway Network Route Table for details).</p>
<p>(2) National Highway Management: In the initial stage of taking over national highways, the road sections listed in the approved table, totaling 38,608 kilometers in length (see the National Highway Takeover Route Table for details), will be taken over by the central government. The Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for construction, maintenance, improvement, and transportation administration, and will also handle supervision and other matters in accordance with the Highway Supervision Implementation Regulations. The remaining road sections will be temporarily managed by the provinces.</p>
<p>(3) Traffic Management: Traffic management of all highways in the country will be unified in accordance with the various regulations approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Transportation. For national highways taken over by the central government, the collection of road maintenance fees and matters related to traffic safety will be handled by the Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>(4) National Highway Takeover Measures: Some of the national highway routes listed in the appendix to the second item, which were originally managed by the China Planning Bureau, such as the highways in the southwest, northwest, and Sichuan-Kang areas, will continue to be managed by the China Planning Bureau. For the remaining roads originally managed by the provinces, the Ministry of Transportation will negotiate with the provincial governments to formulate measures for gradual takeover. National Highway Network Plan Route Mileage Table (Note: The national highway routes for the nine northeastern provinces, Taiwan province, and Hainan Island will be announced separately.)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Living in an Upstairs Apartment</h3>
<p>— Feng Tinghe</p>
<p>People accustomed to living in upstairs apartments have a natural pleasure, just like people accustomed to living in the countryside. This pleasure has a "difficult to explain to outsiders" quality, and only those accustomed to living in upstairs apartments can truly appreciate it. If you are an upstairs apartment dweller and you happen to live in a ground-level house for a day or two, when you close your eyes and meditate, if you recall living in an upstairs apartment, you will truly have a feeling of floating between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>I love living in upstairs apartments. When the moon is beautiful and the flowers are blooming, I lean against the railing of the upstairs apartment and listen to the chirping of insects and birds. Cooking smoke twines around my sleeves, and the clouds give my face a flying kiss. Then I think of the writer Wang Can, who was moved by the scenery and wrote a poem. Although his emotions were delicate and beautiful, almost like the feelings of a young girl, it is certain that the fact that he climbed the stairs caused him to have such a pure and poetic inspiration and write a poem.</p>
<p>People who have lived in Beiping for a long time often like to talk about the unique sounds of the city of Beiping. However, only those who live in upstairs apartments can understand the art of these sounds. I lived in Beiping for a long time, and I spent most of those long years living in upstairs apartments. My perception of the sounds of the city of Beiping went through three stages of evolution. At first, I was annoyed and thought they were the whistles of the city, emitting many different tones and giving the citizens a variety of calls. A little later, I found these sounds pleasing to the ear. A certain sound could express a certain meaning. Later, after I got used to hearing these sounds when I lived in an upstairs apartment, I felt very familiar with them, like many musical notes playing a complex and changing nocturne of the ancient city every night. The apartment I lived in was on a quiet street in a bustling area. Pushing open the window and leaning on the railing, I could clearly see those who were making the sounds. Then I began to marvel at the greatness of this ancient city, and I also savored the elegant interest of living in an upstairs apartment.</p>
<p>My trip to Wuhan was an unforgettable memory in my life. Among these memories, I should describe my feelings about climbing the Yellow Crane Tower. Speaking of the Yellow Crane Tower, this historically famous scenic spot is the most politically significant tower in ancient and modern times. When I climbed the tower, I was filled with emotion and stirred up the ancient thoughts that had been hidden in my heart for many years, imagining how the heroes of the past used nature to expand their strategies. The Yellow Crane Tower is in an excellent location, giving those who climb it a profound impression of grandeur and magnificence. When I climbed the tower and leaned against the railing, I felt like I was about to fly away with the wind.</p>
<p>I also remember an old-fashioned winding corridor-style tower in the home of a relative in my hometown. Their ancestors left them such an interesting tower. The floor space was very large, and the construction was ingenious, connecting front and back, left and right. The wide areas were like large courtyards, and the extended areas were like corridors. That kind of environment was unique. It was also situated next to mountains and water, with lush flowers and trees, which added to the spectacular nature of the tower. I spent a summer there. At that time, I was organizing poetry, and my mind was filled with beautiful and lingering moods and words. Combined with the poetic environment around me, it tasted like chewing olives.</p>
<p>Many people like to talk about the scenery on the lake. I also want to talk about it here. My hometown is Poyang Lake, one of the five great lakes. My home is a waterside village on the lake, with winding embankments and graceful willow branches. My home is a layered building in the style of a waterside pavilion. Looking out the window, I can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the lake. Because it is close to the water, when the lake floods, the lake water is close to the top of the tower where I live. So I can fish from the top of the tower, catching various kinds of fish easily. Sometimes the fishhook would pull on the willow branches along the edge of the tower, startling the orioles, which would fly away to the distance.</p>
<p>Living in an upstairs apartment on the lake naturally makes one accustomed to many aspects of life on the water and intoxicated with the mood of the water. Relatives and friends often release boats into the lake, pick baskets full of water chestnuts, and send them to the top of the tower, giving you a hearty and fresh meal. The most lingering thing is sitting on the top of the tower at night, listening to the boat girl singing amorous songs on the water, which adds a lot of romantic meaning to the life of living in an upstairs apartment on the water.</p>
<p>During the war, I also spent a period of time teaching in a mountain village. The school building was borrowed from a temple, and I happened to live in an upstairs apartment near the temple. The mountain temple was quiet and secluded, the forests were silent, the fog embraced the cliffs, and the waterfalls were sealed off. The quiet life of the monks gave people a feeling of being outside the world. Occasionally, I would talk with the monks on the top of the tower, listening to their stories of ghosts and foxes, and their preaching of Buddhist scriptures. It was both strange and novel, as if I was in the world described in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Among the many interesting aspects of living in upstairs apartments, living in an upstairs apartment in a mountain temple is also worth describing, filled with simple and elegant interest.</p>
<h3>The Use of Auxiliary Words in Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>Wang Changling's "Fishing Pond Poem": "Opening the door, I gaze at the long river; at twilight, I see a fisherman. May I ask the white-haired old man, how many years have you been fishing?" Meng Haoran's poem: "The place where I live is the most secluded, those who live there are all quiet. Relying on this mountain gate, who can imitate me?" Both rhymes use auxiliary words, which are elegant and refined. Chu Chaoyang's poem "Ode to Five Silks": "Deep beneath the water, it rests; in the middle of the day, it is congratulated." Gao Bi's poem "Serving the True Lord": "Its brilliance shines brightly; the heavens are in this place!" Han Shaoshi's poem "Special State": "Employment or dismissal depends on the time; poverty or success depends on fate"—this is an example of using auxiliary words in regulated verse.</p>
<h3>Night Reading</h3>
<p>— Li Yitiao</p>
<p>When I was young, I happened to read an ancient-style poem called "The Joy of Reading," and I was quite moved by the lines "The reader's joy is boundless, in the quiet of the night, the windows of homes are still, a full moon shines on the frost-covered sky." This vividly describes the scene of reading on an autumn night. Although I didn't have much experience of reading at night at the time, I already felt that only in this way could it be considered a beautiful state for reading.</p>
<p>My school life in the ten years before and after the war was mechanical and chaotic. Although I had to study under the lamp and work diligently every evening during self-study, I never experienced the beauty of reading at night because of the noise and distractions. In the autumn of the thirty-second year [of the Republic], my schooling came to an end, and I started working in a small town in Huaibei. Our office was on the quietest street in the town, and I lived in the most secluded small building. The building faced the street on one side, but the other side was a small square courtyard. Although the two flower beds in the courtyard were half-ruined, the pomegranate and other flowers and plants were still lush and verdant. As soon as I saw this environment, I felt that it was very suitable for reading. After a few days, life had generally settled down. There wasn't much to do during the day, and of course there was plenty of leisure time at night. The small building was quiet and dust-free, and the books on the shelves had already begun to beckon to me. A few days later, it happened to be a moonlit night. Under the clear light, I leaned on the railing and gazed leisurely. The shadows of the flowers in the courtyard were on the wall, sparse and picturesque. The empty street outside the building was cold and silent, and the barking of dogs could be heard from time to time. At this time, my excited heart gradually calmed down due to the quiet environment. I began to open my bookcase, picked out a copy of "Sword South Poetry Collection," and recited it aloud under the moonlight. In a relaxed mood, I suddenly felt that this wonderful night was all mine, and the moonlight and flower shadows were all set for me. From then on, I began to experience the true joy of reading at night.</p>
<p>After that, I never forgot to read whenever there was a good night. However, I mostly read poetry collections or essays from the Song and Ming dynasties. Because I felt that only these things were suitable for the current environment; if I were to open up the classics and histories, I would feel out of place. Gradually, I also felt that reading alone was not enough to reward this wonderful night, so when the mood struck me, I would spread out paper by the window and write some essays or miscellaneous thoughts. The things that came out of this environment sometimes had no lack of inspiration. I kept writing and kept sending them out. From autumn to winter, I had dozens of articles published in total. Thinking about how diligent I was at writing back then, even I am surprised now.</p>
<p>In the winter of the year before last, I rushed home to finish my wedding. My wife was my classmate when I was young. We had been separated and scattered during the turmoil, and hadn't seen each other for ten years. A week after the wedding, I left my hometown again and went west. Since then, because my work had increased dramatically, I not only had no time to write articles, but I also gradually felt that I didn't have that peace of mind even for reading at night. Only when I went home each time, after everyone was asleep at night, would I often read with my wife by the light of a lamp. A cool moon filled the courtyard outside the window, flower shadows floated, all sounds were silent, and the sound of chanting could be faintly heard. This scene was as poetic and picturesque.</p>
<p>After returning north, I was increasingly involved in worldly affairs, and my mind became more and more restless. Sometimes, writing two short articles was already stealing leisure time from my busy schedule. The joy of reading at night had long since disappeared. Reflecting on the past in the quiet of the night, I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.</p>
<h3>Rural Sketches</h3>
<p>— Xu Minghuai</p>
<p>Sunset</p>
<p>The wings of the evening breeze begin to gently caress the still heart.</p>
<p>The sunset is a boat with sails full of crimson red cloth, stranded on the mountainside, struggling laboriously, panting娇喘, shyly... like the moment after a young girl bathes. Her rosy cheeks, which can be broken with a blow, cast a final enchanting smile, a weary smile.</p>
<p>The sunset is beautiful. A charming slender hand gently strokes the back of a thin, yellow cow. A shepherd boy whistles a light, clear whistle. The wisps of sound ripple into the evening breeze. A few shoulders of firewood are carried, slowly crossing the small bridge in front of the village, the lush hazelnut forest, and the crows fall rustlingly in the twilight. Vague and misty, it creates a serene and tranquil scene worthy of Van Gogh's brush, a mood that is sad and distant, an atmosphere that is refreshing and sorrowful...</p>
<p>The sunset is a beautiful little poem.</p>
<p>The poetry of the sunset is painted on the pale blue dome of the sky, sprinkled on the pale blue surface of the lake, like a lyric poem written on the poet's pale blue heart, oh. Xia Duoboli wrote in "Remembrance":</p>
<p>Do you remember the tranquil lake surface,</p>
<p>Touched by the light, agile swallows,</p>
<p>The swaying reeds are worried by the wind,</p>
<p>And the sunset on the water, so beautiful.</p>
<p>Reading it, I miss my friends in the distance. Reading it, I get sick, I get a melancholy sickness. Reading it, I feel the sigh of life, the loneliness of life, the eternal loneliness, the eternal sigh...</p>
<p>Night</p>
<p>The hazy dark clouds quietly fall, sadly and somberly kissing the wilderness.</p>
<p>The night sleeps, like a feverish corpse. The wilderness, emptiness, and unhindered spread; at the end of the earth, someone is lonely telling the story of the night:</p>
<p>In the jujube forest, at dusk, who has left behind a crisp and tender soul? A petite life struggles in rags. A wild dog approaches, revealing a gluttonous gentlemanly sneer, arguing fiercely, barking madly, tearing apart the dark fate, is it rejoicing, is it a praise?</p>
<p>A more mournful sound drifts into the night mist.</p>
<p>Cries permeate the low building, the amorous widow after dreaming, drowsily, trembling whispering, containing tears, silent sighing, silent sobbing, is it love, is it regret, is it hate.</p>
<p>The wooden fish rings out an enduring melody, accompanied by the nun's pious, gentle murmur.</p>
<p>The oil lamp bursts out joyous sparks, illuminating the unfaded youth: flushed face, rosy lips, fair skin, full curves with a rose-like smile.</p>
<p>A few large black shadows jump down from the wall, all flashing green, lewd, greedy eyes, thick black hairy hands tear apart the strong blue cloth pants, bestiality explodes like a bomb, continues to explode.</p>
<p>The black shadows disappear on the wall, leaving behind wave-like, satisfied, base laughter, a weak, painful groan, the oil lamp gazes in disappointment at the performance and finale of this tragedy.</p>
<p>Phosphorus fire, the eyes of ghosts, blink seductively with a dismal green light, the skull beckons from a pitch-black tomb, someone, hanging their head, dragging a cane, walks through the weeds. The dim eyes are low, so leisurely, serene, as if going to a grand banquet.</p>
<p>The birch trees rustle all around, the shadows of the trees press on the black keyboard, a dirge begins to play in the cemetery.</p>
<p>The thin neck falls on the belt tied to the elm branch, the feet leave the ground. He smiles, having found final comfort. "Death is the brother of sleep?" Yes.</p>
<p>You hear, someone is telling the story of the night to the earth, at its end, lonely, ceaselessly; the night is dark, like a feverish corpse. The dark clouds are even heavier, sadly and somberly kissing the wilderness——</p>
<h3>Summer · In a Mountain Village</h3>
<p>— Chen Mao</p>
<p>Hillside</p>
<p>The hillside lazily continues, under the summer sunset.</p>
<p>The grass, lush and tall, thick and dense, stubbornly grows. The creeping kudzu entangles them, climbs over their heads, and climbs up a small chestnut tree.</p>
<p>A cicada sings loudly on the small chestnut tree, and another cicada echoes in the distant trees: "Zhi——la——"</p>
<p>The clouds move leisurely and slowly under the sky.</p>
<p>All around is quiet, quiet; even the sheep quietly graze, and a child can fall asleep in the shade of a tree.</p>
<p>Stream</p>
<p>The stream flows in the shade of the trees, the water is so green that it seems black.</p>
<p>A small fish slips out from under the roots of a tree, playing happily, but, upon seeing the sunlight sneaking in through the leaves, it splashes and slips back in surprise.</p>
<p>Upstream, a mountain village girl squats quietly and intently on the stone steps, she is serving a crab.</p>
<p>Further upstream, children are splashing water and making a fuss, the sound of laughter echoing the sound of women washing clothes with mallets downstream, and a cautious shrimp suddenly shrinks into a crack in the rock.</p>
<p>In the nearby mountain village, a hen is slightly telling that she has laid another egg.</p>
<p>Thatch Shop</p>
<p>In the lonely mountains and fields, a thatch shop is more precious to travelers and laborers than a palace.</p>
<p>The thatch shop leans against the ancient mountain road, at the foot of a hill or ridge, lonely stopping.</p>
<p>There is a shed in front of the thatch shop; a village woman sits in the shed, doing some work for her child. In the shed there is a tea jar, a table, and plenty of shade.</p>
<p>Strong and rough laborers, lonely and melancholy travelers; in the shed, they become friends, lamenting life together, comforting each other's experiences.... In places where people are scarce, affection becomes natural, sincere and frank.</p>
<p>In the evening, the cool and quiet shed becomes the paradise of the lonely children in the thatch shop. They will climb on the table and stare at the mountain mists and ridges with lonely hearts, humming some mountain songs.</p>
<p>And on the thatched roof, wisps of smoke rise.</p>
<p>When the sun wearily sets into the mountains and the distant ancient temple rings the leisurely evening bell, the twilight, it honestly covers the mountains and fields, ......</p>
<p>Then, the evening star, it appears on the treetops...</p>

<h3>Inscription on Ling Xu's Painting of Ling Bo Fairy</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Barefoot on the wild waves, treading without dust,</p>
<p>I thought to imitate the startled swan, not necessarily mad;</p>
<p>But the trace of dissolving form is still preserved,</p>
<p>Your teacher is also a person in the painting.</p>
<p>How many times have I pondered the pure offerings at dusk,</p>
<p>Living in the mountains, poor and unable to sell incense;</p>
<p>I want to pluck plum blossoms, the bright moon advises,</p>
<p>The spiritual energy of the empty hall flies freely.</p>
<h3>Presented on Ji Kang's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>I envy your elegance that transcends the mundane,</p>
<p>You are skilled in writing famous names, wonderfully entering the divine;</p>
<p>Heavy makeup or light makeup are all natural,</p>
<p>They compete to spread the word that the beauty of the country belongs to this person.</p>
<h3>Ladies</h3>
<p>— Ji Kang</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 351</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Speaking of Yaoqun, her only secret is "enduring fatigue." As long as there is something to do, she can endure it, enduring for fifty or sixty hours without blinking an eye. Her philosophy is also very special: she says, "When we do things, we should have the spirit of an old gambling addict playing mahjong; even if it's three days and three nights, we should become more energetic the more we play." This type of person relies entirely on concentrating their spirit to maintain their interest in the task; interest can drive away the sleep demon. Fortunately, she is a healthy young woman, with no distractions, knowing only "national affairs first" and "work first." Unlike ordinary social ladies, who focus on "luxury above all else" and "love above all else."</p>
<p>The little tiger's sleep problem has no amazing performance: 1. Because he is greedy, he wants to sleep as soon as his stomach is full; 2. A child who is only twelve or thirteen years old is in the middle of development, and naturally needs to sleep. Of course, he has martial arts skills and can endure fatigue, but it is entirely out of coercion. We also don't let him lose adequate sleep, as long as the work is not too stressful, we always let him rest fully. Since joining the work, especially when he is around Yaoqun, we never let him endure fatigue, so as not to hinder his development. But I can predict that when he grows up, his endurance will definitely not be less than that of Mr. W.</p>
<p>Regarding my personal sleep problem, it's a bit of a myth. At first, during my student days, I relied on some strong memory skills. I usually only read miscellaneous books and never studied my lessons. When it came to exams, I only needed one or two all-nighters to pass all ten or so subjects; in some subjects, I could even get the best grades.</p>
<p>The myth originated from a time during the old system's high school graduation exam. Several of the main subject teachers happened to be fierce gods and evil spirits from the Twenty-Eight Mansions. I had tasted their flavor during several monthly exams; in addition to the regular writing, they also used hidden tricks. Especially that math and science director, he treated students as his enemies of seven lifetimes. At least five out of ten test questions were obscure materials scraped from the cracks in the textbook. So the whole class, regardless of whether they usually worked hard or not, had to pull all-nighters for the sake of "diploma supremacy." And this graduation exam lasted five or six days; even the best spirit could not sustain five or six nights; moreover, during the day, they had to go through "a hammering-style exam with fatigue bombing."</p>
<p>At that time, I met a theology student (I heard that he is now a receptionist at a famous temple in Hangzhou). He looked at us pitifully and taught us a kind of "sleep sparsing" method, changing eight hours of sleep into twelve fragmented rests; it was called something like "Rest and Cease Zen Gong," each rest only required about ten minutes; and there was no need to go to bed, it could be done anywhere. The mantra was seven steps: "Sit peacefully," "Lower the eyelids," "Support the knees," "Feet firmly on the ground," "Focus," "Circulate the breath through the heavens," "Awaken." The first four steps are of course easy to understand and do, in other words, it is to settle down each part of the body, let go of worries, and entrust yourself to the chair you are sitting on and the piece of ground your feet are on. "Focus" means imagining your eyes looking at your lower dantian, the center point of a round ball. "Circulating the breath through the heavens" means treating all the organs and meridians of the body as the five lakes and four seas, and starting up the imagined small ball, walking along the seabed, rising along the back, passing through all parts of the brain, flowing through the joints of the left or right limbs, pausing at each joint, like traveling through the five lakes and four seas, until it has traveled throughout the body and returned to its original position.</p>
<h3>Waterwheel</h3>
<p>— Hu Yingdong</p>
<p>For people who grow up in a water village, water is the source of their life. Look at the green waves of the rice fields, even under the scorching sun, they still grow strong and energetic.</p>
<p>The waterwheel makes rhythmic sounds by the lake.</p>
<p>Under a cool shed, the bare-chested peasant has a purple, shiny chest, dark, thick, and strong legs, stepping up and down. In this way, see how the water flows tricklingly from the lake into the rice fields, even the frogs in the rice fields happily begin to sing; the crops straighten their backs to welcome the water source, swaying in the wind, green smiles unfolding in the fields. The waterwheel turns.</p>
<p>The green waves undulate, the peasant sweats, his eyes filled with hope, humming a village song, letting the waterwheel turn endlessly...</p>
<p>The revelation of power, the rush of water, the leap of sweat and hope.</p>
<p>The people of the water village place their hopes in the singing of the waterwheel, it, the working mother of the water village, has abundant milk to nurture the fields,...</p>
<p>The sound of labor resounds in every corner of the summer water village.</p>
<p>Summer, a season of growth, the laborers of the water village will not waste it.</p>

<h3>Assisting the Families of Martyred Journalists</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Worthy of our pride, during the enemy-puppet period, many journalists fought the enemy indomitably. Many people fell in pools of blood, many were intimidated, many lost their freedom, many were tortured and became disabled. This is indeed a brilliant and splendid page in the history of journalism.</p>
<p>But the families of those martyred journalists are living a life of poverty and disease. Those reporters who suffered brutal torture by the enemy-puppets and are still lingering in hospital beds are rarely cared for.</p>
<p>The reason why these martyred and suffering reporters are so righteous and heroic is that they have only one belief: only the interests of the nation matter, not personal interests. They do not compromise, do not betray, do not fall into the water, refuse all threats and temptations, and are unwilling to collude with the enemy-puppets. This is something worth writing about in detail.</p>
<p>Although they were in Shanghai, they were no different from those fighting on the front lines; bombs and guns threatened and exploded around them every day, but this did not shake their beliefs.</p>
<p>Now, this newspaper is raising donations for the families of martyred journalists. Anyone with a sense of justice will certainly not refuse this request; anyone who knows a little about the history of how foreign merchant newspapers fought against the enemy-puppets will certainly be more generous and willing to donate. Why not offer a little money as a token of our respect for the families of martyred journalists?</p>
<p>The dead are gone, but the living are still enduring hardships and supporting this difficult life. We cannot reduce our psychological guilt except by providing practical assistance.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Marshall and Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>— Lei Ying</p>
<p>Many people seem to think that the policies of Marshall and Wedemeyer are completely different. Many people also say that Marshall's failure in China has tarnished his reputation.</p>
<p>They don't know that Eisenhower was originally just a junior officer under MacArthur. It was Marshall who personally promoted him and allowed him to take charge of his own affairs. They don't know that it was not the "executor" Eisenhower who was responsible for deciding on the Normandy landing and opening up the second front, which eventually led to the collapse of Nazi Germany, but the "decision-maker" Marshall. They may not even know that it was Marshall who personally promoted Wedemeyer from a sergeant who had just returned from studying in Germany in 1938 to a colonel in 1940, and then gradually promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general in six years!</p>
<p>Although General Wedemeyer is already silver-haired, he is actually one of the younger and more junior generals in the US military. His talent has made him stand out in the history of American military strategy; therefore, his relatively "late" start today may indicate a more brilliant and unlimited future. Many American experts are already whispering that he is the most likely successor to Marshall and Eisenhower. From August 1936 to June 1938, Wedemeyer interned at the German Army Academy in Berlin. He was a "mindful" person who paid attention to everything. After returning home, he immediately submitted a thick report of one hundred summers to the Army Department. Coincidentally, the general in the US Army Department who was responsible for this type of report was the now famous Marshall—, he was then Brigadier General Marshall.</p>
<p>Marshall was greatly impressed when he saw this report. From then on, he maintained constant contact with Wedemeyer. By 1940, Wedemeyer had become one of General Marshall's most important advisors.</p>
<p>In April 1942, the US General Staff, based on all the most reliable intelligence and various statistical materials, determined that 1943 was the best opportunity to cross the English Channel and directly land in Normandy. Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, accompanied by General Marshall and Marshall's staff, flew to England to seek the British side's agreement to the US General Staff's opinion. After several days of debate at 10 Downing Street, King George himself finally adopted the US proposal. However, two months later, Lord Mountbatten (the current Governor-General of India) suddenly flew from England to England and became a guest of the White House. He repeatedly stated that it was inappropriate to open up a second front in 1943, first expressing doubt, and later providing firm arguments. He stayed for two weeks, and on June 18, Churchill himself also arrived at the White House. His speech was much better than Mountbatten's. He said that the Allied people were suffering in the depths of misery, and the army should not delay any longer. He suggested immediately attacking the Mediterranean, with a particular focus on the Balkans. Although Churchill's arguments were well-reasoned, Marshall and Roosevelt were both very clear in their hearts that Churchill was playing the game of the British Empire. Churchill opposed the Normandy landings; he said that the German army had not been weakened, and if they were rashly attempted, it would inevitably cause a second Dunkirk.</p>
<p>After Churchill's eloquent speech ended, Roosevelt immediately consulted with Marshall. After Marshall quietly listened to the President's opinion, he immediately turned around and said to a slender colonel, "You can talk about why the United States must insist on the Normandy landing, and why the war must be conducted in 1943."</p>
<p>This colonel immediately stated the various reasons in an orderly manner, and even Churchill's eloquence paled in comparison to the calm expert's judgment.</p>
<p>This slender colonel was the current Lieutenant General Wedemeyer. He recited all the figures and accurately predicted the Soviet counteroffensive, which coincided with the 1943 plan.</p>
<p>Roosevelt finally adopted a compromise: the strategy was based on the American army, the Normandy landings, and the time was based on the British army, delayed by one year, and changed to 1944.</p>
<p>To this day, everything has proved the accuracy of the American estimates. In the summer of 1943, the German army had only twenty-nine divisions. By the time the landing operation began in 1944, the German army had been replenished to fifty-eight divisions. The Allied forces' one-year delay in operations also strengthened the German defenses on the Western Front. Moreover, in the winter of 1942, the Soviet army was struggling to recover Stalingrad. If the Allied forces had attacked in 1943, then the Soviet Union would have no place to intervene in Germany today.</p>
<p>It was Marshall who insisted on this 1943 offensive plan; it was then-Colonel Wedemeyer who formulated this plan. From this, we can see how deep the relationship between Marshall and Wedemeyer is.</p>
<h3>Such a Dad</h3>
<p>— Luo Ta</p>
<p>Our daughter had a fever for more than ten days, and I had to get up every night to serve her, which made me very tired. Finally, I said to my husband, "If she cries again tonight, you get up." That night, she cried that she wanted to drink boiled water. I woke up my husband, and he jumped up, ran to the kitchen, poured a glass of boiled water, drank it himself, and then went back to bed and fell asleep soundly.</p>
<h3>That Person, Yu Ji</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leng</p>
<p>! Miscellaneous Theories of Wei and Jin People, Part Three</p>
<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, written by Luo Guanzhong, portrays Yu Ji as a man of esoteric arts, saying he could summon wind and rain, achieve liberation from the body, and even, in the end, use sorcery to frighten Sun Ce, a man of great ability, to death. But in my view, Yu Ji was actually a peasant leader engaged in secret work who unfortunately failed midway, a theorist who educated the peasants and encouraged them to rise up in struggle.</p>
<p>To support this argument, I need to list facts in detail. However, because his historical materials have been distorted and pruned by scholars of past dynasties, it is quite difficult. But one thing can be confirmed, and that is: from the "Yellow Turban" rebellion launched by Zhang Jiao in the first year of Zhongping during the reign of Emperor Ling (184 AD) to the disintegration of the "Rice Rebels" led by Zhang Lu in the twentieth year of Da'an during the reign of Emperor Ling (215 AD), throughout these decades of peasant uprisings in China, their thoughts and actions can be said to have been influenced and incited by Yu Ji's theories. The Biography of Xiang Kai in the History of the Later Han Dynasty states:</p>
<p>"Initially, during the reign of Emperor Shun, Gong Chong of Langya presented a book to the emperor, claiming it was bestowed upon Yu Ji. The book was obtained on the Ququan River and consisted of one hundred and seventy volumes of divine texts, called the Book of Great Peace and Purity. The officials reported that it was deceptive and preposterous, so it was collected and stored away. Later, Zhang Jiao possessed many of its books."</p>
<p>In general, in any planned peasant uprising in feudal society, whether in China or abroad, at the beginning, they almost all used the guise of gods as a tool for their activities and expressed their political consciousness through religious creeds. Recent examples include the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution in the Qing Dynasty, and more distant examples include the German Millennial Anabaptist War. Considering Yu Ji's time, it was precisely on the eve of the Yellow Turban rebellion. The social environment, according to the Food and Goods Chronicle in Book 26 of the History of Jin, was as follows: "In the first year of Yongxing during the reign of Emperor Huan, a large part of the kingdoms suffered from locusts. The Yellow River overflowed for thousands of miles, displacing hundreds of thousands of households. In the early years of Jianning and Yonghe, the western barbarians rebelled. For more than twenty years, wars continued and the army grew old. Military expenses amounted to more than 320 billion, and the imperial treasury was empty. During the chaos of Dong Zhuo, grain cost 500,000 per dan, and beans and wheat cost 200,000. People ate each other, and white bones piled up. The remains and leftover meat stank in the streets." Imagine, as peasants who were ruled over, if their lives were so unbearable, they would naturally develop the thought of taking risks. Therefore, Yu Ji happened to discover a divine book at this time. The book was also deceptive and preposterous. Judging by common sense, the so-called divine book was probably a small booklet he wrote himself, a kind of propaganda that criticized society and encouraged struggle. In order to hide it from others' attention, he fabricated a myth to rely on. Otherwise, why wouldn't Yu Ji hide it like other sorcerers and take advantage of it for personal gain? Moreover, why would the officials even obtain it and present it to claim credit? Furthermore, why would Zhang Jiao raise an army after having this book?</p>
<p>At the same time, based on Yu Ji's own behavior, it can be further understood that he was extremely ambitious. The commentary in the Biography of Sun Ce in the Book of Wu in the Records of the Three Kingdoms quotes Jiang Biao Zhuan with a wonderful description:</p>
<p>"Yu Ji first resided in the east, traveling to and from Wu and Kuaiji. He established a refined residence, burned incense, read Taoist books, and created talismanic water to cure diseases. Many people in Wu and Kuaiji served him. Sun Ce once gathered his generals and guests in the tower above the city gate. Yu Ji then approached in grand attire. Two-thirds of the generals and guests below the gate went down to greet and bow to him. Those who tried to stop him could not. Sun Ce immediately ordered his arrest. Those who served him all had women enter to see Sun Ce's mother and teach her. His mother advised Sun Ce. Sun Ce said: 'This son is deceitful and can confuse the minds of the masses, causing the generals to no longer observe the rites between ruler and subject. He must be eliminated.' The generals again jointly submitted a petition, but Sun Ce did not listen and immediately ordered him to be beheaded and his head displayed in the market."</p>
<p>Assuming that Yu Ji was simply a sorcerer, he would never travel to and from Wu and Kuaiji and serve the common people so diligently. If he did not have organizational relationships with the generals and guests of Eastern Wu, he would not have had such great power, even to the point of making them forget the rites between ruler and subject and "go down to greet and bow." The reason why Yu Ji was killed was probably not only because Sun Ce saw that he was very popular, but also because his underground work had achieved great results and the organized forces had played a great role. Therefore, perhaps he relied on a peasant's heroic spirit to deliberately show off his power to Sun Ce during his meeting; or perhaps his plan had matured and he planned to start an uprising at that time, but as a result, Sun Ce caught him and had him beheaded. Otherwise, how could Sun Ce, such a famous filial son, dare to go against his mother's words? Why would the generals and guests jointly submit a petition? Afterwards, Records of Searching for Spirits and others also said that Yu Ji took his life? Comparing and associating these events with each other shows that the inside story must not be as simple as described on the surface.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Puppet Shows in America</p>
<p>Puppet shows are a Chinese product. Puppet shows looked like this a hundred years ago, and they still look like this now. One puppet requires the puppeteer to stand behind a cloth curtain, manipulating the clumsy puppet and singing out-of-tune tunes to earn sporadic coins from peddlers, porters, and street children. There is also a type of itinerant performer called "spirit mediums," whose stomachs can talk, but the voice is very small, and one must press one's ear close to their belly to hear it. In reality, it's not their stomachs that are talking, but still their throats, the sound going down, as if muffled in the belly. Neither of these professions amount to much, allowing one to make a living but making it difficult to rise to prominence. Americans are different. Hollywood produced a man named Bergen, who combined "puppets" and "spirit mediums" into one. He speaks with his mouth closed, loudly and fluently. Even in a theater with more than a thousand people, his voice can resonate throughout the entire theater. He raises his right leg, and on his knee sits a puppet named Charlie wearing a tuxedo. Its facial features and limbs can all move. Bergen speaks on behalf of Charlie on the one hand, and on behalf of himself on the other. He can even incorporate the intonation of a third person, representing three people all by himself. The dramatic language is mainly based on humorous dialogue. Bergen cherishes his cash cow, Charlie, with meticulous care. Charlie's bedroom contains a large number of costumes, but in reality, Charlie always wears the same old tuxedo, an old bow tie, and a pair of monocles when he goes on stage. Now there are many people in America who are following suit. Their puppets come in all ages and genders, and their comedic skills can also quickly catch up. But their fame and appeal are not as great as Charlie's. Charlie has a scene in the movie "Hollywood Canteen," and Charlie has also been invited to the President's Office, sitting next to Mrs. Roosevelt, becoming a guest of the White House, winning a lot of applause. This kind of talented person becomes a first-class artist in America, but in China, they become street performers or swindlers who control the spirits of the dead. How lamentable! (Editor's note: If there is an opportunity, I hope Mr. Xu will talk about string puppet shows.) (24)</p>
<h3>Summer Records by the Window</h3>
<p>— Fengren</p>
<p>Zhu Gao's Tomb</p>
<p>Behind the Xia Hill of the West Lake Building, there is Niu Gao's tomb. Niu Gao was a great general under Yue Wumu, and he can also be called a national hero. However, the desolate ruins and ancient trees are desolate, and few tourists know the tomb of Marquis Fuwen. It is said that, "Once there was a shepherd boy who passed the ridge with the setting sun, squatting on a stone to urinate. Suddenly, a great man, black and bearded, angrily scolded him, saying: 'I am Niu Gao, why do you urinate on my head?' and pushed him into a stream, more than ten feet deep. A grave backed by a ravine, covered with weeds. It was indeed Gao's tomb. So, those who were fond of good deeds began to renovate it slightly." This legend is of course absurd and unreliable. With the Marquis's bravery and loyalty, if his heroic spirit were immortal, he would never manifest himself to a small shepherd boy. However, from this, it can also be seen that even for heroes, their posthumous glory and honor are fortunate and unfortunate. Lin Shu of Minhou also recorded a section about Niu Gao's tomb, saying, "One day, I visited the Ziyun Cave and inadvertently asked the residents, and then I found the tomb of Marquis Fuwen. The tomb was built with stones in a circular shape, almost completely covered with thorns. There was no way to reach the tomb. At that time, the host of my eastern tour was Mr. Chen, who was then teaching in Renhe County. I asked Mr. Chen to repair the Marquis's tomb. Mr. Chen agreed and took out three hundred gold, which he paid to the servants, Huang Fu. I wrote the epitaph, but Huang was stingy with the Marquis's tomb, but generously with the pavilion. The tomb was only cleared of grass, but the pavilion was splendid and gilded, with stones as pillars. One night there was a great thunderstorm, and the pavilion collapsed, but the epitaph remained standing. I secretly sighed and said that I was still waiting for his spirit."</p>
<p>Few people know about this matter, and it can be considered a local anecdote of West Lake. However, as time passes and days change, thorns and weeds have grown again, and human traces are rarely seen. Brother Niu is really unlucky. Now only the epitaph "Tomb of Niu Gong, Marquis Fuwen of the Song Dynasty" is still recognizable, said to be inscribed by Chen Xiao. Alas, where can one find someone else who likes good deeds to drive away the underground foxes for Brother Niu?</p>
<h3>Fish Species in the Deep Sea</h3>
<p>— Wang Ge Liang</p>
<p>The sea still contains many mysterious riddles! The highest diving record for us humans is only about 1,000 meters. The average depth of the sea is about 3,000 to 6,000 meters. In 1927, the German warship "Emden" discovered a deep sea of 10,830 meters on the eastern sea of Mindanao Island in the Philippine Islands. Its depth is the highest in the world. If the world's highest peak—Mount Everest—were put in, you still wouldn't be able to see the tip of the peak! (Still half a nautical mile short!)</p>
<p>Generally, people think that the fish species must have difficulties living in places 2,000 meters below the sea surface because of food. However, according to the reports of previous investigation teams, they unexpectedly found fish species inhabiting the deep sea areas they investigated. In the deep sea of 6,000 meters, most of these deep-sea fish species are black or light gray, with few scales, and have a leather-like epidermis. There are various sizes of fish, ranging from two to three inches long to five to six feet long.</p>
<p>Researchers of biology from European and American countries often venture into the seabed in deep-sea diving spheres made of steel to observe the living conditions of deep-sea fish. On the way to sinking to the seabed in a diving sphere, the color of the sea changes from blue to green, to gray. When it exceeds 500 meters, it becomes pitch black. However, in the windows of the diving sphere equipped with strong lighting equipment, you can still see all kinds of rare and exotic things. For example, there is a kind of fish that has whip-like appendages on its lower jaw and tail, and it emits strange and beautiful light. There is also a kind of fish whose own volume is very small, but it can swallow fish that are larger than its own body. Its stomach is inflated like a sail of a sailboat. The fish it swallows are all curled up and stored in its stomach, and it slowly digests them. There is another kind of fish that has a hook wire about four times longer than itself, protruding from its upper jaw. And the front end of that hook wire also has luminous objects specially designed to lure seabirds. It hides in the crevices of reefs, quietly waiting for the arrival of seabirds. Seabirds float leisurely on the waves, attracted by the luminous objects on the rocks, and then this wonderful little fish can suddenly catch the seabird and use it as a rich dinner.</p>
<p>The most interesting and strange thing is the male fish with the scientific name "Spinipus." It only adheres to the female fish like a tumor. Its mouth is completely fused with the female body, and it cannot eat or digest on its own. It relies entirely on the nutrition of the female fish to live. Its only duty is to fertilize the female fish. It is truly a veritable "parasite."</p>
