<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕國府廿二日令：茲修正中華民國國民政府組織法第一條及第十五條條文公布之，此令。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中常會第六十六次會議，於廿一日晨中央聯合紀念週後，在中央黨部會議室舉行。蔣總裁親自主席，通過修正中華民國國民政府組織法第一條及第十五條條文如下：</p>
<p>第一條　國民政府依據中華民國訓政時期約法第七十七條之規定，爲由訓政達到憲政過渡期間，特制定中華民國國民政府組織法。</p>
<p>第十五條　國民政府五院院長及副院長，由國民政府主席選任之。（按該條删去後段一國民政府主席對中國國民黨中央執行委員會負責，五院院長對國民政府主席負責」一節）。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國民政府組織法及行政院組織法，頃又經國府明令修正公布。聞此次公布之行政院組織法，係就現行政院組織法加以修正，藉以適應由訓政到達憲政之過渡環境。至上次國府爲準備行憲時適用而先期制定公布之五院組織法，則將視憲政準備之進度，另行規定其施行日期。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕中常·國防聯席會通過修改國府組織法後，政府即午通知民社黨黨駐京辦事處即以長途電話轉知該黨滬方人士，故新任府委民社黨人士胡海門·戢翼翹兩氏，已定廿一日夜車晋京，徐傅霖將待與彼等晤面後赴滬。徐參加府委問題，尙待赴滬商討後，始能決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕政院定廿二日上午開例會，仍由蔣兼院長主持。新任院長張羣，定二十四日就職。副院長王雲五，秘長甘乃光之任用令尙未公佈，可能於二十三日首次府委會中決定，惟原任秘長蔣夢麟已定二十四日停止到院工作。二十二日之政院例會，將在國府舉行，重要議案有：（一）中阿（根廷）友好條約之批准，（二）縣市參會在地方自治未完成前，對縣市財政之監督辦法，及（三）蘭州等市之組織規程等。</p>

<h3>中交農三行改公股　國防會重加研議　另提具體原則送交立院</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕中央銀行法及中國·交通·農民三行之立法原則草案，正由立院審議中。其原則除中央外·中·交·農三行，立院主張將其完全改爲公股，資本全數由國庫撥發。國防會蔣委員長原以目前無此必要，應重加考慮，提出三點意見，交該會財政·經濟·法制三委會研議。該委會等業已遵奉研議，於廿一日國防例會中提出具體原則，並經大會通過，仍送立院核議。茲誌委員長意見如次：（一）最近新頒布之經濟緊急措施方案，對若干國營事業正擬發行股票方式，售與民間，今中交農三行原有人民股份，爲時已久，倘反令退股，在政策上，不免前後矛盾。（二）商股股東如令退股，則發還股金，勢不能照戰前入股原額；如照物價與幣値比例，則牽動更大，易滋糾紛。（三）商股股東（包括一部份法人）原佔比例旣有限制，且董監事大部份爲政府所指派，一切經營措施，自可循國策進行，並不因有商股股東而受影響。基此三點，中交農三行完全取消商股，在目前實不相宜。</p>
<h3>國防會昨通過　三行立法原則</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國防會廿一日通過中國，交通，中農三銀行條例之立法原則，三行大致類似。資本分公股及非公股二種，後者至多不得超過總額百分之四十。運用款項於主要業務部份，不得少於百分之七十。各行設董事廿五人，常董九人，董事長一人，監察九人，常監一人。三行之總經理（各一人），副總經理（各一人至二人），均爲專任，由董事長商同常董，就富有金融學說及銀行業務經騐者選定，提經董事會同意聘任並呈報財部核准。至三行之主要業務，中國行爲辦理國際貿易之金融事業及國際匯兌，交通行辦理工鑛，交通，公用之金融事業，並經國府特准得發行實業債券。中農行辦理農林，魚牧，墾殖，水利，土地改良之金融事業，經國府特准得兼辦土地金融業務及發行農業債券，土地債券。</p>
<h3>鴨綠江與黃海水道　半月內可望通航　我外部已接獲蘇方答復</h3>
<p>〔中央社安東廿一日電〕鴨綠江與黃海之水道航運，最近半個月內，即可開始。此間關係當局正積極準備開航事宜，聞我外交部已接獲蘇方答覆，同時政府對此間亦有三點指示：（一）中蘇兩國船隻航行水面，必須懸掛各該國國旗。（二）船隻應携通行證，聽候檢查。（三）不合於上述二項規定者，可即扣留或射擊。另悉，停泊碼頭有浪頭及大東港兩處，五百噸至一千噸級船舶，可以自由往來。莊河及大李山東南各約五十里之大王家大路兩島燈塔，短期內即可發光。記者詢詢各方意見，據悉，水面治安，絕對安全，惟望政府能使由安東至大東港及由灌水至通化之兩鐵路綫，早日實現。</p>
<h3>鄭洞國等飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕東北保安副長官鄭洞國，行轅副參謀長董彥平，外交特派員張占非，再度奉召飛京。三氏今下午五時由瀋專機抵平，定明廿二日轉京，記者曾趨訪，惟三氏發言極審愼。據悉：（一）蘇聯雖照會我接收大運，但實際接收，尙有若干問題待商決；其中尤以通過旅順駐軍區爲最大癥結。（二）旅順區中國駐軍問題，根據中蘇約，旅順為中蘇共同使用軍港，中國自可駐軍，惟此事仍有糾葛。管理旅順之中蘇軍事委員，我方委員大致內定，惟蘇方尚無派定消息。旅順市長，案據條約，須獲蘇方同意，蘇已否同意尚不悉。（三）大連為自由港，海軍長期駐防有問題。（四）中蘇條的中俄文本雖聞有出入，但尙談不到修改。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕鄭洞國談：（一）石河蘇軍越境三公里說，未有所聞。接收大連外交與軍事俱有問題。記者詢接收大連是否須兩三個軍？鄭答：個把軍即可。（二）林彪被殺有可能，惟尙未接得確報。（三）東北共軍現有五十餘萬，刻猶在擴大，並增強裝備中。</p>

<h3>處理日賠償物資　我擬就初步辦法　運費二千餘億由政府先墊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十一日電〕處理日本賠償物資初步辦法已擬就，將再交經濟部工輔導處，全國工協·商協會·及有經騐之廠家專家作進一步之研討。根據經部所擬定初步分配方案，共計一萬二千七百噸，運費二千二百零一億，是項運費，可由政府先行墊付，則由廠家自籌，其中主要乾，有中國紡織機器製造廠一千一百噸，運費一八九億，經緯紡織機器製造廠一千一百噸，一八九億，以上二廠，均已設立，尙待設立者，有八家，計聯合電機製造廠，聯合內燃機製造廠，聯合採冶化學機器製造廠，聯合鍋爐製造廠，聯合水力機震旦機製造廠，以上五廠，各一千一百噸，運費三二九億，聯合蒸器機製造廠一千一百噸，運費一八九億。其次，對於地區之分配，亦有所擬定，計電力煉鋼廠二座，一座設於漢口，一座設於廣州，均係五噸之電爐，每區年產鋼錠三千噸。輕工業分配於民營者，計軋製鋁品廠一處：設於天津，軋製鋁品廠四處，分設於天津·漢口·廣州·青島。</p>
<p>〔又電〕聞賠償物資中，其中百分之五十至六十，將交配予民營工廠及申報曾受損失之廠商，其餘百之四十至五十為政府所有，但其中三分之一亦將售予民間。關於整個分配比例，將由政院賠償委會召集有關方面代表共同商討，再予決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據某權威人士表示：我國對於運用日本賠償物資，已訂有極詳盡之計劃。關於資金之指籌，設廠之地點，配件之訂購，人才之配備，應有盡有，蔚成一巨冊。但整個預算之確定，則尙有待，原因為：（一）對像未清，究竟我國能獲得若干工廠？為何種工廠？目前尙未揭曉，所需之經費實無法準確估計。（二）此次賠償之性質究為「先期拆遷」，抑為總賠償，華府方面亦未作最後決定。惟我國已針對各種可能性，作縝密之準備；同時保證凡運回者，必為有用之物資，不致如外界所傳「近於廢鐵」之物。依目前現狀觀察，至早七月中方能啓運。</p>

<p>水利工程專家在會議中提出之意見認為：防止未來之水災正與泛區復耕同樣重要，因之皖省淮河復堤工程實屬必要。疏浚運河，自屬善舉，但疏浚工程費用浩大，且不能迅速完工，故淮堤必須加強，以保障淮河南岸之低地。按照聯總行總技術專家所擬訂之三年計劃，豫皖蘇三省泛區應復耕土地二，五〇〇，〇〇〇英畝，現流落外省之難民，每日回歸豫省泛區原籍者，達二千人之譜，行總豫分署工作人員，正努力從事急賑工作。</p>

<h3>日本總選舉的趨勢</h3>
<p>四月，是日本的政治月：所謂四月選舉，包括地方長官，參議院議員，眾議院議員，地方議會議員四種選舉，必須於四月內完成。地方長官選舉，包括日本全國縣長四十五名，市長百九十名，投票於四月五日開始，現已選舉完竣。繼地方長官選舉之後，為四月廿日至廿五日新議會的選舉，其程序是：廿日開始選舉參議員，計共二百五十名；廿五日開始選舉眾議員，計共四百六十六名。中央議會選舉後，三十日各地方再進行地方議會議員的選舉。中央和地方的議會，於選舉後成立，依新憲法六十七條規定：內閣總理須由議會選出。所以日本四月的普選，不僅要決定吉田內閣的命運，並且為未來日本政治的「重大試煉」。</p>
<p>選舉，是政治動向的指針，政黨起伏的攷騐，並且是民意的測標。四月五日開始舉行的地方長官選舉，結果業已判明；無黨派獲縣長卅二席，市長百五十三名；民主黨獲縣長三席，市長廿席；自由黨獲縣長四席，市長十九席；社會民主黨獲縣長三席，市長九席；共產黨無所獲，其他小黨派獲縣長三席，市長八席。所謂無黨派，充滿保守的色調；民主黨是進步黨的改變，與自由黨同為保守勢力的中堅；社會黨是左翼政黨，同共產黨是與黨；小黨派色彩不鮮明，政治上無大力量。在地方長官選舉進行上，保守勢力的分進合擊，表徵日本人民對於民主的失望，但這對保守勢力的競選，則為一種有利的因素。地方長官的選舉，可說是中央議會選舉的序幕，它的趨勢很明白，亦可能反映議會選舉的結果。據日來東京廣播，三千八百卅五萬以上的選民，現已開始投票，秩序是十分平靜；看趨勢，二百五十名的參議員，保守勢力至少可得一百七十一席，社會黨可能有進步，但不能取得優越的地位，共產黨為新憲法上的上議院，舊憲法的貴族院。昔日的貴族院議員，乃皇族，華族，勅選議員和多數納稅者所構成的封建集團，於三月卅一日解散了，第一次由人民直接選舉參議員。皇族的封建集團雖是退潮了。繼之而起的乃為保守勢力，這不待說，廿五日的眾議院議員選舉，亦可能有同樣的趨勢。</p>
<p>綜合以上的分析，我們可以指出日本政治的動向，及民意的歸趨，第一，日本這次的四月選舉，本於麥帥的指示。二月七日，麥帥致吉田首相一封『選舉勸告書』，告其應於九十三屆議會閉幕後，舉行全國的普選，配合新憲法的實施。日本政府接受了訓令，於二月十七日決定了四項選舉的日期，於三月卅一日解散了議會。美國第八軍，為監視選舉的進行，四月五日便出動分區指示，所以說這次的當選，是在麥帥指導下進行的。第二，日本新憲法，是一部進步的憲法。依新憲法的規定：國會由眾議院及參議院構成之，並且為國家的唯一立法機關，同時也是國權的最高機關。以前由政府命令決定的事項，從此將由法律來決定。因之，國會議員的權力很大，他們可以決定政府的命運，他們可以決定政治的動向。保守勢力的勝利，是日本民意和國勢的要求，左翼勢力的下沉，也是日本民意和國勢的決定，因為日本民族喜歡保守式的民主。他們的政治希望和經濟要求，是循序漸進的改革，不是一種社會革命式的突變。今天的日本，突變必崩潰，保守則存在。所以這次普選，保守勢力握有必勝之籌。第三，這次選舉的方式和選舉費的龐大，助長了無黨派曁民主黨自由黨的抬頭。這次選舉，是將大選舉區劃為小選舉區，分區用直接投票的方式，進行四種的選舉。保守勢力代表地主資本家和官僚，他們在區域上佔有優勢，選舉必然屬於他們。不僅有廣泛的地域，并能支付數億以上日圓的選舉費，進行各種必要的活動。共產黨的選舉經費是千萬日圓，望塵莫及，其必然遭到敗北，不難逆料。日人揣測一席議員當選，代價為五十萬日圓。社會黨共產黨，無力支付偌大選舉費，自無力取得更多的議員。政治隨着經濟走，經濟拖得左翼勢力疲苦不堪，前途黯淡。保守勢力的勝利，政府黨的勝利，自是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>我們對於日本政治是關心的，波茨坦宣言規定：『代表日本民意的政府』，始能促進日本的進步。我們希望日本政治進步，社會安定，民意伸展，於和約簽訂的前後過程，履行對於盟國的義務。新政府成立有望。我們希望日本從此能踏上民主的大道，厲等行新憲法的精神。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：外長會議今日進入第七週，對於主要問題如　國及奧大利問題，仍無決定。美方認爲蘇聯若能作若干讓步，則美方自亦作讓步。又訊：外長會議因閉幕在郎，正加緊工作。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：四强外長會議本日開會討論特港財政委員會報吿時，馬歇爾·貝文·皮杜爾主張將該報告提交聯合國研究，但莫洛托夫堅決反對，結果四外長一致同意交四國外次研究。同時對外次應於何時提出報吿，發生激烈辯論，因此事與四强外長會議何時延會問題，直接有關也。最後關於時限問題，由四國外次自行決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿一日廣播：莫洛托夫謂美國允許以經濟援助特港，實係對特港事務「「外來干涉」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿日電〕四國外長會議於今晨將對奧和的之計劃，作初步研究，業已完成。此項和的能吾在莫斯科由四強簽字，明日即可揭曉。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿日電〕四強外長今日討論對奧條的，有良好進展，彼等已完成整個條約之審查，並就該的上半部從事第二審査，以澄淸若干猶無協議之次要點。今日原定於下午再由外長開會，但臨時已被取銷，改由外長代表於今日下午及明晨開會，審査外長交議之條文。外長亦將於明日繼續審查奧國條約之下半部，並討論特里埃斯特財政委員會之報吿書。今日外長會議，會場空氣誠擊，對於若干次要未決之熟均已成立協議。原定於今日討論之各條文中，有八條已獲最後解決，十一條留待外長或其代表繼續審査，九條則仍朱獲解法。觀察家相信若主要問題若疆界，賠償及德國資產等能獲解決，則對奧條約之最後草案可望於最短期內完成。今日已獲最後解決之八條乃：（一）對奧條約之序論章，英國建議在本章內確定奧國在戰爭中之責任已被採用；（二）奧境德人之歸化及居住；（三）戰犯之移交；（四）禁止前納粹及其他非法組織之人員服務於奧國軍隊；（五）限制邊疆要寒設備；（六）因交還聯合國在奧財產而引起之糾紛，設專門機構以解決之；（七）奧國若干鐵路綫之過境便利；（八）批准奧國條約之機構。今日之會議旣已澄淸各未決之次要點，明日開會時，當可集中於主要各點之討論。</p>
<h3>馬史再度會晤　或有實現可能</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿日電〕關於史丹林元帥與美國國務卿馬歇爾舉行會談事，頃由星期泰晤士報外交記者撰文加以評論稱：此項會談，並未造成任何發展，足使美蘇雙方有漸趨諒解之希望，但史帥與馬帥舉行另一次較有效果之晤談，仍有其可能。若謂蘇聯政府不可能採取最後一分鐘之行動，以防止外長會議決裂，實屬不智。惟以外長會議之一般體形而論，在大體上仍可悲觀。關於增加魯爾區及薩爾區之煤斤分配與歐洲煤斤委會各委員國一事，業已成立協議，此項協議實可代表英外相貝文爲滿足法國外長比杜爾不斷要求所作之一大努力，該項協議係以法代表團所堅持之主要原則爲其基礎，即德國所生產之每一噸煤斤，其輸往國外之百分比，應予以確切規定，不應僅以德國本身需要以外所剩餘者，較往外國。以前之辦法，有使德國礦工不願增加生產之可能云。</p>

<h3>納粹巨犯　死無葬身之地　屍體被焚成灰投入河中</h3>
<p>〔路透社慕尼黑廿日電〕可靠方面稱：去年十月被絞決之十大納粹戰犯以及戈林之屍體，於火火化後置入軍用垃圾箱，由盟國將軍四人，沉入此間附近伊薩河中。四將軍分別代表英美法蘇四佔領國，於一嚴寒之早晨，在拂曉前親自將骨灰箱投入河中，當時不許任何助手或副官在塲，以嚴密保守沉沒地點之秘密。</p>
<p>當各犯在紐倫堡監獄絞決後，翌晨即十月十六日早晨，有軍用卡車二輛在監獄庭院中將十二具未漆之木箱置入車上，其中十一具內儲屍體，一具則係空棺，意在故佈疑陣，兩車司機奉命須加速開駛，但亦決不可肇禍，以免躭擱彼等之使命。隨行者有載運全副武裝之美軍之吉普數輛以及前述四將軍，一行在紐倫堡街中曲折急馳，以免遭人跟踪。出城後即取道特別封鎖之公路，直馳慕尼黑，乃將木箱分三層壘置，放於火化塲內。</p>
<p>當時火化塲各德籍職工均被調開，循英蘇兩將軍之要求，並將戈林及季德爾之棺打開，以作最後檢査。棺由美軍官一名打開後，蘇聯將軍向兩棺檢視，並揑戈林之頰，以騐其是吾確已死亡。檢視畢，重將兩棺釘好，乃召美軍堵墓登記部人員二人入室，開始焚化工作。當時言吿火化塲職員，謂所焚者乃美陣亡兵士屍體，然以行事秘密，故職員等已不難猜得棺內所臥爲何人。</p>
<p>四國將軍俟戈林及季德爾之棺焚化後即退去，由一美國軍官監督其餘各棺之焚化工作。至午夜前不久，四將軍復返，時各屍已被焚成灰。一將軍建議將各死者骨灰置入一器，較爲便利，於是十一人之骨灰乃被置入一軍用垃圾箱內，乃將該箱置於一普通德國黑色轎車之後座，直駛慕尼黑之伊薩河，投入急流之河水中。此乃希特勒親信最末之旅程。其後美軍官一名在火化塲內發見十一具小型金屬缸，然其中並無骨灰，想係另一疑陣耳。</p>

<p>又稱：曾二次向陳局長簽呈，建議設立材料審價委員會，以評定材料價格，但均遭局長駁回。至於陳局長駁斥理由無從知悉。蔡定邦科長立即解釋稱。陳局長以市塲價格隨時有變動，使不熟悉市塲情形之非專責人員共同辦理，不能收效，且用料處職員參加購斜後，反易生弊端，故未准。張鴻圖又稱：曾上簽呈致局長請撤換張伯康，但被陳局長退回未准。蔡科長亦代表答稱：彼簽呈時，局中已接到密吿。並當庭呈上陳局長函，說明張伯康爲張鴻圖之親信，關係極深，指爲勾結舞弊。張鴻圖聆知信中內容後，亦當庭反駁稱：張伯康雖由我介紹入局，但一介紹並不能就是『親信」，如陳局長介紹更多私人入局，豈盡爲「親信」耶。庭上又提出會經塗改之報價單，向張鴻圖質問，據答二處長僅批購料比較表，報價單乃商人所提，可請詢問商人。</p>
<p>太太之事　非所必知</p>
<p>庭上又詢以郁香嚴所做之事，何竟一無所知，據答：在現今婚姻制度下，太太所作之事，先生非所必知，更無理由必定要知。張鴻岡並提出三十四年十二月十日部令曾擬調用張伯康，亦爲陳局長所阻而未果，故今陳局畏指張伯康爲我之私人，實甚不當。訊畢張鴻岡，又訊其餘十一被吿，渠等所供，均一致吾認知情舞弊，分得款項亦皆以爲是賞金，前後共三次，第一次是陽曆年底，第二次是陰曆年底，第三次是端午。經偉鈞直認所收之款皆由渠一人經手，惟稱商人自動所送，並未强要。但到庭作證之商人則供，係經偉鈞來借去。被吿辯護律師因審訊時間已過久，故辯詞皆甚簡略。</p>

<h3>電力供應轉佳　工廠申請用電　多能如願以償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據上海電力公司負責人談，本市電力供應情形已日臻佳境，在舊公共租界區內及滬西區內之工業用電現已可可儘量供應。最近區內工廠前往該公司申請者爲數甚衆，均可如願以償。又自夏令時間實行以後，全市電力當可節省不少，惟究能减省若干，因夏令時間開始實行迄今，尙僅一週，故一時尙無確切統計。上週末曾因工榮用電與住宅用電於夏令時間施行以後。未經調整，致發生不够分配之現象，因而一度局部停電。緣電力公司前以本市電力不足，徴得各工廠之合作，在每晚住宅川電最多之時間內，輪流停工三小時，使電力供應保持正常狀態，而免愼壞機器。新鐘點實行後，工廠方面依照新鐘停工開工，但住戶方面由於習慣，其熄燈時間大都照新鐘延遲一小時，例如工廠原來在舊鐘每晚十時開工者，現即在新鐘十時開工，而住戶則原來在舊鐘十時就寢者，現往往仍遲至新鐘十一時，因此在新鐘十時至十一時此段時間內，住戶仍在繼續用電。工廠亦已開始用電，雙方同時需求，電力遂又不够分配。上海電力公司現爲改善此種情形，已商得各工廠同意合作，將每日停工開工時間亦延邋一小時，以避免與住戶用電衝突。</p>

<h3>北大男女同學生活</h3>
<p>— 和靖宇</p>
<p>女同學跟男同學都沒有界限，在敎室裏或圖書館都可隨便以姊妹兄弟視之。</p>
<p>聯大的女同學大部分在淸華，極少數在北大，但北大的少數復員學生中，却有好些復員的昆明小姐，她們互相之間仍舊說着「是啦麼」的雲南話，去過雲南，跑過八年警報的人聽了，好不令人憧憬悵惘，也覺得另有一種親熱，八年的溫暖昆明，在四季如春的長長日子裏，不知白了多少人的頭髮。至今還有許多敎授的家眷留在那四季春光的昆明養病，而且生活也特別便宜，雖然當年曾做過世界生活第一昂貴的都市，而且維持了很久的第一位指數。</p>
<p>中國進步　必有現象</p>
<p>女同學的量很大，醫學院和農學院以及擁有四百人的先修班都不在沙灘，工學院初剏，只有一年級新生，還在文理兩院上課，但最有趣的是習電機和機械的已有許多的女生，在昆明時工學院第一次只有一桌女生，中國進步了，女工程師在不久以後的中國一定會比現在的女律師更多。樂觀主義者的胡校長認爲這是中國進步必有的現象，看到今日女同學的苦苦用功，可能在憲法眞正實行之日，咱們政府也許會像美國一樣有女勞工部長出現。</p>
<p>談到女同學，誰也不能忘懷了她們美醜的問題·因爲大多數生長在北平，故說京腔者佔百分九十九，就是從末來過北平的，也自然學上了一口「人話」（老舍先生當年的妙語），滿嘴都講着流利圓潤淸跪典雅的北平話，這確實增加了不少的美，雖然她們的衣飾六不如上海的江灣或大夏光華，但除了衣服的考究以外，她們却常常跑進圖書館或實騐室，甚而至於在考完以後還霸佔了圖書館的座位，看着並非敎授指定的圖書和美國歐洲新寄來的學術期刋，有的多利用假期，潛心論文著述，看得兩回電影，上得一趙東安市塲吃頓便宜客飯，到底是百分之一二的極少數，比起上海十里洋塲，舞廳裏一杯香茗兩萬法幣，北大和淸華的男女同學只有自慚形穢，望塵莫及，不免現得「寒蠢」，嘖嘖稱美。美麗的靑春一半消磨在學問上，一半的一半消應在普通生活上，另外一半的一半消磨在戀愛上，大概這種百分比也就很洽當吧。女同學們中，以大姊自居者甚多，有以全部人生安排於學術工作者，「仕」各有志，其此之謂歟。</p>
<p>辯論問題　蔚成風氣</p>
<p>男同學近日批評女同學以爲淸華的質較北大爲優，質者美之別字也。原因是聯大時期美的多，而淸華有聯大女生最多，故淸華之質勝過北大。又有人說北大量大，量旣大則質亦必精，至少精的或然律大，這又是另一種邏輯。兩校學生，原出一家，故星期天，城裏城外互相拜訪之風極盛，而男同學當然互相討論着這個問題，北大同學中有精通風水劉伯溫之學者，以爲淸華園的大門開得好，而北大各學院分開，並無大門其物，連個大門也沒有，風水請問從那裏好起！這或爲雜家陰陽家之說，當然已非儒家正統了。可是兩校的女同學跟男同學都沒有界限，在敎室裏或圖書館都可隨便以姊妹兄弟視之，探討學問，辯論問題，互相質疑，蔚成風氣。圖書館設備稱得起全國首富，有如許多的好書，不去鑽硏，當然可惜。遷人而問，少有寗日，國家給聘了這們多的大學者，咱們總得對得起國家，這世界至今是學者統治的，而戰爭却是科學家完成的。</p>
<h3>愛國廣肇等中學　請四行借款未成</h3>

<h3>留美各國學和　中國佔最多數　計一千四百九十八人</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕此間外國學生聯誼會與國際敎育協會，皆私人團體，彼等聯合對留美外國學生作年終統計，總數達一四·九五六人，創該會廿餘年來之新紀錄。但報吿中又稱，準確人數可能更多，蓋該會統計截止期爲二月六日，不免有所遣漏。總數中百分之十三即一·九一五人，來自遠東或西南亞洲。其中中國學生人數最多，共一·四九八人。菲律賓次之，計二九五人。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿一日電〕哥倫比亞大學師範學院，現有來目美洲大陸以外之學生，造成最高之新紀錄。總數三百六十二人中，男性佔一百六十八名，女生爲一百九十四名。其中人數最多者爲中國·印度·加拿大·彼多黎各，與夏威夷。</p>
<h3>市校學術進修費　本週內可能發放</h3>
<p>本市各市立學校學術進修費，市府可能在本星期內撥交敎局分發。頃聞敎局國敎處刻正統計各校已收學術進修費數額，及未收各校人數，以便市府經費撥到後，立即分配發放。學術進修費全部發放時，已收費而未具報之各，校恐不予分配，而已收之數，則應一律退還學生。至於未收學術進修費，並未向敎局呈報者，亦將取消其分配權。故凡學術進修費調査表，不在本月二十四日以前報局者，勢將遭受無形損失</p>
<h3>私校呈准立案　中小學共卅校</h3>

<p>（丁）球及球拍球與球拍與普通規則上完全相同，故不再贅述。</p>
<p>規則內容</p>
<p>圓桌乒乓是從原有普通乒乓變化而來的，它所用的規則，當然與原有的規則大部相仿，但是因外形，地位，設備裝置和人數的不同，所以有些地方，也不能完全相同了，現在把各異的地方，列在下面。　（甲）三人淘汰制　這是同時供給三人玩的遊戲，下面是與普通乒乓不同的幾點：</p>
<p>（一）（方位）三人應站立的方位，用抽籤法決定，抽籤第一名可以選擇優良的方位和發球權，第二名可以選擇次等方位，其餘的方位歸第三名。</p>
<p>（二）（計分）普通的乒乓規則，採用得分制，三人制的圓桌乒乓，因爲三角聯賽的關係，應該採用失分制，三人中先失滿十一分者就算失敗一局，假使三人或二人同時各失十分時，那末應當以再失滿二分的人爲先失一局</p>
<p>（三）（發球）獲得發球權的，爲發球員，其餘的二人均爲接球員，發球員先將球拋起，拿球拍拍擊使球由本區域內彈起，而再越過網，落於左右任何區域內。謂之發球，下次發球權由每次失分的人獲得。</p>
<p>（輥）（接球）接球的人，可以把球向左右任何二區內還擊，但是不能向同一區域內，速送三次或三次以上，據個例來說：第一甲給乙，乙第一次也可還給甲，第二次甲可再給乙，乙第二次也可還給甲，第三次甲就不能再給乙，一定要給丙了，吾則甲乙二人打一輩子，丙一個人等一輩子，那豈非笑話。</p>
<p>（五）（淘汰）三人中首先失滿十一分的，就歸淘汰，算第三名。其餘二人因爲不能玩圓桌乒乓，就以失分的多少，以定名位的高低，失分少的爲一名，次少的爲第二名，假使在第一個人淘汰時，而其餘二人積分適相等，那未去計算二人中最後失的一分，此分誰後失，誰爲第一。</p>
<p>（乙）四人淘汰制</p>
<p>關於四人淘汰制的規則，像方位，計分，發球，淘汰，均與二人淘汰制同，僅送球的範圍，略有變更，四人制不能向同一區域連送二次或二次以上，因人數增加一人，送球的機會也增多一區，進攻的範圍擴大，對於攻方是在在有利，在守的方面講，攻入的機會多則愈難防守，大有人人自危的不安心理，那末向同一區域連送的次數，當然不能超過二次或二次以上爲宜，據個例說，第一次甲給乙，乙第一次可以還給甲，第二次甲就不能再給乙，必需要拍給丙或丁了。</p>
<p>（丙）四人雙打制</p>
<p>雙打是兩人爲一組的對抗遊戲，雙方選擇的方位，和發球權，都用抽籤法決定，假使抽籤得勝的一組，願作發球者，或接球者，則對方有選擇方位之權，假使抽籤得勝的願選方位，則對方有決定先作發球者或接球者之權，但抽籤得勝者願意時，仍得將選擇之優先權讓其對手，同隊二人的站立方位是面對面形成一直綫，發球規則與前相同，拍擊的目標當然是向左右兩敵人進攻，但必要時也可向對面同隊人區域內拍去，藉以休息候機乘虛直入，不過向同隊區域內不得連拍二次或二次以上，發球時不得向同隊區域內發出，計分方法採用得分制與前節相反。雙方得分滿十一分者爲勝一局，三賽二勝以定勝負，發球權採用輪流制，與普通乓乒規則同，恕不贊述。</p>

<h3>外埠售價一再狂升　促成三市紗價暴漲　警備部稽查開始調查紗號帳冊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：近日滬市紗價連續暴漲，外埠價之廠漲，實爲促成主因之一。以廿支紗價爲準，昨日瀋陽市價，侮件仍在一千一百萬元之　。自天津　運出口後，本市遲深瀋之紗，已改道至營口轉口。日來滬紗市牛莊帮吃胃廳健，良有以也。又聞天津方而，自禁運出口後，刻又覓得新出路取道北平轉口。故廿支紗在天津之市價，又告回堅，已達七百萬元。靑島紗價與天津相仿。他如漢口，江西，廣州等地，廿支紗價大致均徘徊在六百五六十禺元之間。長沙價約六百六七十萬元。又以日來北方紗市俏利，本市每日成交北銷之棉紗，數在三五百件之間云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備可令部爲抑平紗價，取締不法之投機買賣起見，昨起由該部稽査處經濟組級長張亞民，向該部所屬各稽査大隊，借調大批幹員，分成二十四小組，開始發動至全市各紗店調査帳册，同時根據綫索，至各堆存棉紗之倉庫，調査存紗。昨因澈査工作執行伊始，尙無情節重大之案件發生。惟悉：該項澈査工作，將繼續執行，直至紗市步入正軌而後止。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據紗商業公會理事長唐志良談稱：近日來紗市波動原因：（一）供求不平衡，（二）生產成本與議價不平衡，（三）各地紗價不平衡。有此三因，可知滬市紗價之騰漲，決非單純游資之作祟，所能造成。深望政府對工于商實業，應積極鼓勵扶助，造成生產事業爲有利可圖之事業，則市塲游資當能自然趨向生產之途徑云。</p>
<h3>統債市况平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨以活動份子似趨往股市居多，高後稍回，雜脾亦被帶低。統丙晨開十五二〇〇元，由四一二室進至一五五〇〇元，五〇三室及散買均售，返低至一三〇〇〇元以內，而後轉盤。結果較上週六計甲乙跌一千元，丙降一千四，丁戊亦挫一千三，成交約六百萬。</p>
<h3>外股買多略升</h3>
<p>外股昨在暗市匯水之奇俏聲中，證券帮及廣帮力加吸納。午後驟激起新買風，怡紗晨開四〇七〇〇元，低價四〇四〇〇元，午後漲到四四五〇〇元，而後稍盤。結果較上週六計鋼業英聯各昂成半强，航業升一成不到，怡紗會德豐業廣紙業怡啤各漲一成，餘均微升。財部已轉全經會參考</p>
<h3>商會採行　進出口連銷制</h3>
<p>財部已　全經會參考</p>

<h3>西安廣州兩地　需要大票最殷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲補救各地現鈔之短絀起見，已決定發行一萬元票面之鈔券。惟該項鈔券之發行，目前亦僅限於現鈔最短細之西安及廣州兩地。西安方面，最近因新棉登塲，需要大宗現鈔收購。廣州方面，則因鉅額僑匯湧到，亦需支用大量現鈔。致日來各銀行對該兩地之匯率，日見提高。現聞該項鉅額票面現鈔，即可於最近期內，運到兩地流通使用。該兩地之現鈔恐慌，可望解除。又該兩地之高昂內匯率，亦可望予以抑平云。</p>
<h3>票據交換金額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據上海票據交換所發表統計：該所三月份交換金額共計一一，八九〇，九八〇，九九七，四六六·九四元，交換張數共計二，二七〇，六〇一張，差額共計一，一三八，三四六，〇四七，五二六·一三元。至各日之平均歟，則金額爲四七五，六三九，二三九，八九八·六七元，張數爲九〇，八二四張，差額爲四五，五三三，八四一，九〇一，〇四元。又三月份交換日數共廿五日，交換票據每張平均金額爲五，二三六，九三三·四〇元。</p>
<h3>人絲值淡月　月需不足千箱</h3>
<p>本市人造絲，黑市價格，上週曾破千萬大關，與中信局配價相差一倍以上。據中信局代售會負責人說：此次人絲之上漲，全係人爲，一般投機者當缺貨之際，故意抬高價格。實則人絲需要，已屆淡月，銷數最大之絲　業，現値夏令，有光貨品均已停機。織帶業入暑季後，亦不能工作，故需要量大爲减少。上月所配出者，僅九百餘箱，本月份亦不致超過此數。最多時曾配出三千餘箱，與之比較，已差三分之二以上。麥帥總部每月曾允供給五千箱，本月份因運輸關係，未能及時配出。近有二千五百箱，於十五日裝船，日內即可到達。一俟提貨後，即照各廠所需數量，全數配出，配價不變，每箱最高價，天橋仍爲五百五十萬，其次束洋金三馬，仍爲五百三十萬。高山朝日仍爲五百廿萬，市塲當可趨穩定。</p>
<h3>各方紛來吸納　華股再見高峰</h3>
<p>華股昨以一般市價重起漲風，人心被激而俏，業中多頭雖有了結。但出後依然　２進，業外實力派資力雄厚，有進無退，最後仍　十分倘利之象，漲達限度者達十餘種之多。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>俱昂，統益由九一號首先漲停。八五號八三號一二九號雖賣，二二三號一九九號二二號一八〇號九七號一五四號一四二號六八號九一號一〇七號二八號一九七號八九號一五五號來進，遞永紗自四三〇〇元左右，一度掙扎後，即吿扶搖直上。火柴由一七二號一二號等，水泥由一五九號，永業由六九號，內衣由一五一號一七三號紛吿漲停。永紗逐步漲到四四三〇元，永公中紡商務迫近漲停。一五二號三八號二一五號九四號一七四號買出，永紗退爲四三二〇元。一一七號九七號趁低有補，尙有回升，無如一五二號三五號二三七號二三一號一八五號一〇五號趁高一再傾售，乃迫低至四一一九〇元。八九號一四二號一五四號一二九號來進，紗布及一般黑市飛躍不己，人心大振而漲到四四〇〇元左右。五和由二八號進至漲限。一一七號三六號二一三號逢高供給，而回降至四三五〇元左右。但以物價之激昂異當，于間務榮盟亦漲達限度。乘低仍有大量維持者，二二四號二三三號一一七號亦納，午收仍盤。貫果較上週六計永紗華豐景福中法永公各升半成光縈。新華微降。信和美亞漲一成豐。遞父計永紗信和美亞華豐公景福各升半成左右。冷股榮豐商務火柴五和水泥內衣均達漲停。中紡統益漲停後有回。國貨跌半成，餘均漲半成左右。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>遞永紗開低至四三〇〇元，一四二號一六九號二三二號一一二號均進。五和由二八號，火柴由一五七號三〇號，永業由六九號，九福由一七一號，內衣由二一九號等，紛紛漲達限度。遞永紗升爲四四〇〇元光景。九四號七六號一五二號一四號一八五號乘高買到四三二元，二一五號一四土豆號購買，升爲四三八〇元。二三五號二二三號九七號七六號再賣，再迫低至四三一〇元。商務由一三一號，榮豐由一四四號，大通由一一二號，統益由一〇二號，遞美亞由八九號，紛掛漲停，人心復俏，逐步拉高。六一號一四號八九號二三一號一五四號一五一三號二二三號一二號二一八號一四五鵝一五二號一六〇號二〇六號紛進，遞永紗漲到四六二〇元一而後稍盤，收後成價　高。結果較上週六計永紗漲半成强，新華微升，華豐信和景福中法永公各漲一成內外，美亞漲停。遞交永公景福升一成不到，永紗美于亞信和華豐各升一成。冷股計統益大通商務火柴五和水泥九福內衣永業漲停，國貨微降，中紡中絲新亞升一成弱，塲外各股續升半成强。</p>

<h3>染料漲價原因　囤風又起　津幫刻胃加健</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕染料價格近又上漲，記者近訪有關方面，歸納其波動之原因如下：（一）北方新收復區增加，津帮商人大量進貨，因供求關係而提高價格，（二）染料之主要化學原料價格，均見提高，故染料隨之而漲，（三）染料之主要用途，在染深色之衣料，在秋季以後用途最旺，現時令已屆初夏，商人已計劃秋季用品，對染料之需要增加。（四個）在去年陰曆年關至今日，染料普遍不景氣，主因爲物價無甚波動（黄金風潮時爲例外），而市塲利率則甚高，商家不願負高利而存貨，故染料價格跌落；但目前漲風又起，而旺月又接近，故囤積之風又盛，造成價格之彼動。此外，萬元大鈔又將發行，對於市塲心理亦不無影響。</p>
<h3>油脂分配辦法　輸管會經已商定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會輸入限額分配處，前經召開「未列名油脂蠟」登記合格進口商會議，商討本年二至四月油脂蠟輸入限額分配問題。當經該處宣佈上項貨品本季規定限額，爲美金五十一萬五千元，其中三分之一左右，業已用以配給本年一月底以前收到之申請書，其餘三分之二，則分配於登記合格進口商十四家，旋即議決分配辦法，一致通過。蓋該處於本季輸入限額數規定以前，遠自上年十一月起，收到輸入許可申請書，爲數其甚多。按輸入臨時管理委員會公吿第一號甲三（乙）之規定：在限額分配辦法開始以前，所有附表（二）貨品，（除五種貨品向由輸入品管理處辦理輸入許可證者外），輸入許可申請書，應由限額分配處管理，幷設法處理之。該處爲顧全登記未竣以前之輸入申請，（此項申請大都代表進口商業訂購之貨）起見，乃決定以一部份限額，淸理舊案。凡限額規定前收到申請書較多之貨品，均用此此法淸理，以期兼顧，惟此僅限於本季而已。至提出之一部份限額，除不合規定之申請書外，均係根據申請數字公平分配云。</p>

<h3>外銷茶無起色</h3>
<p>邇來洋莊茶市，出口商胃納極細微，交易寥若晨星，市勢欲振無力。各種內銷茶除本年度新龍井等，本街店莊及近鄉一帶尙有去化外，餘均零星走銷，趨勢始終保持平衡，續　盤旋之狀。</p>

<h3>看黃河重歸故道　今年大汛能避免潰决嗎？</h3>
<p>— 濟南十四日航訊　本報特派員范麗夫</p>
<p>參加黃河旅行團</p>
<p>由於綏區新聞處范處長奇浚的發起，記者得參加了遊覽重歸故道後黄河的春季旅行團。十四日淸晨乘着大吉普，從新聞處出發，穿過天橋，駛出閙市後，迎面吹來的雖然是一片北國的黄沙，但隨着黄沙所觸入眼簾的乃是一片新綠：綠的山，綠的水，綠的槐，綠的柳，綠的麥苗，綠的芳草，極目千里，渺無涯際，使兩月來被共軍困擾在濟南城裏的記者第一次眞正體味着春來的消息，也第一次呼吸到春來後原野裏所飄散着特有的淸新的泥土香氣，而深深地感覺覺着祖國的可愛，和祖國的偉大。</p>
<p>我們先在埀楊夾道，水明如鏡，富有江南意味，距濟南約十餘里，位於小淸河上的五柳閘盤桓了一個鐘頭，接着，就驅車直馳洛口。這是黄河邊上的一個小鎭，爲了防止黄水，鎭的周圍，也修築了整齊完固的城垣，而北城的城牆則正緊接着黄河的河邊修建的。我們立在城頭上，看到長逾千公尺馳名遐邇的黄河鐵橋正横互在她的東面。橋的西面在黄河改道後原尙有敵僞所築木橋一座，今春黄水東來後爲免於衝毁已光行拆除而易以渡船，以便行旅。波船的渡資是每人四百元，手推車連人八百元，三套大車一輛一萬八千元。橋東在敵僞期間尙築有鋼骨水泥橋墩數個，原來敵寇準備於此另建一洋泥橋以通公車而將原有鐵僑拆移他處，因洋泥橋尙未築成日寇投降而未果。我們大家都禁不住爲這將被撤走而卒未及撤的鐵橋慶幸，吾則今天如欲重建此綿長橋樑正不知將頻增路局若干苦辛呢？</p>
<p>蛇和蝦蟆　成了河神</p>
<p>黄河的河水遠較長江爲混渴，水流亦遠較長江爲湍急。據修防處的探測，今天的水寬爲六四九公尺，流速爲點八一秒公尺，流量一二七·五一秒立方公尺，水深六公尺，計較三日前低降七公寸，一年四汛之一的桃汛是可以平安過去了！當這個可喜的消息傳散出來時，使看黄河的人突增不少活力，於是我們就沿着河堤，也是城頭，緩步東行，不知覺間已來到城堤的東北角，這裏城牆邊上有一門，門外有石階直通河邊，數百鄉民正携瓶抱罐爭先恐後往河上汲取黄水，牆門邊右角又有一小廟，正中供奉着「金龍司大王」的神位，兩旁則爲張楊兩將軍的神位，鄉民將汲取的黄水瓶先置神桌前，然後把燒着的香在置有黄水的瓶上旋轉着，再把香插入香爐，跪拜後始將瓶罐取回。據鄉人云：此項黄水經煮沸後，連水帶泥，呑入腹中，可治百病，而所祭祀的金能司大王正是職司治河的位位大王之一，而傳說着黄河中的蛇就是他的化身，至於將軍，亦有三位，而蝦蟆也就是他的前身，是協助治理黄河的河神，因此鄉民們在河邊上即使發現一條很小的蛇或者一頭大型的蝦蟆，就會奉若神明，燒香跪拜。他她間只彼此間傳說着，八年前黄水改道那天，濟南上空滿佈紅雲，雷聲隆隆，達二時許，但未降雨，從此後黄水即不再來了！八年後黄水回歸故道，他她也不知道這是花園口堵口的關係而只因襲着舊的傳說，視爲神明而認爲再來的河水，可以治病，這種尙停留在印度恒河及埃及尼羅河兩岸民間的古老傳說，他她怎麼會瞭然科學已進步到廿世紀的原子時代呢？這眞正能代表絕對大多數的炎黄子孫的一羣。</p>
<p>七次改道　民不堪命</p>
<p>翻開歷史，誰也知道，這支巨流是燦爛悠久的中國文化發源地，也是中華民族的搖籃，但自有歷史記載以來，她已改道過七次，決口一五八〇次，無一數的生命財產被斷送，國家元氣被損害，因此，黄水所遺留給國人的，也只是無數慘痛的記憶。一五八〇次的決口是記不勝記，這裏只堤一下七次的改道吧！</p>
<p>第一次：周定五年（西曆紀元前六〇二年）決於黎陽（今濬縣）宿胥口，至天津以入渤海。</p>
<p>第二次：王莽始建國三年（西曆紀元十一年）決於魏郡，至千乘入海。</p>
<p>第三次：宋仁宗慶曆八年（西曆紀元一〇四八年）決於商胡，至天津入海，爲北流。而以太宗太平興國八年決滑州，至彭城入江淮，稱南流。</p>
<p>第四次：南宋光宗紹熙五年，即金章宗明昌五年（西曆紀元一一九四年）決於陽武，北流由大淸河入海，南流由南淸河入海。　第五次：明孝宗弘治五年（西曆一四九二年），決於金龍口，奪汶水入海。</p>
<p>第六次：淸咸豐五年（西曆一八五五年）決於銅瓦箱，循今日河道入海。</p>
<p>第七次：民國廿七年六月，決於河南花園口。</p>
<p>這最末一次花園口的改道，漫溢了豫皖蘇三省，使國家每年减收農作物一五〇餘萬噸，流離失所的人民也達六一〇餘萬之多，根據中外水利專家共同硏究的結論，自以堵口復堤因勢利導重回故道爲得計，於是自去春起，堵口工程就開始着，至今年三月十五日，卒吿合龍。河堤亦經責成各省修防處分段搶修、其在魯省國軍境內之齊河至濟陽段復堤工程，八閱月來，已完成土方九十餘萬公方，培修大堤高於洪永位九公寸以上，採運石料萬餘公方，所有石在中水位以下者均已修竣，所有該段工程已完成十分之八，但目下的問題是魯省河道廢葉八年，過去在共軍盤據下的魯西及下游惠民利津一帶經勘察南北大堤多未修整，即收歸官守的民埝，其　　亦多未修復·埝身單薄，能　洪水。桃汎雖因水勢較小，平安度過，然伏秋凌三汎，尤其是再過二三月（即七月）即將到來的伏汎，如修防不善，很可能造成巨大災患，而新近由國軍收復的魯西堤段尤屬刻不容緩，亟待整修。　據修防處陳工程師允恭語記者；在過去，黄河修防，必集全國之力以從之，河政水利，除設有專管的河道機關外，並成爲歷代收民之官的要政，即就淸末或戰前論，在（一）段汎組織方面，山東全省初設有河防營十八營計員工一千六百餘人，專事修守，至民國十九年改爲十八段，尙有員工一千三百餘人，常時官堤長共七百五十公里，尙感員工不敷應用。本年度山東段汎組織核定汎兵總額共六百人，職員一百五十人，魯西民埝又歸官守，以員工七百五十人，修守九百餘公里之堤岸，每一公里半之堤段，僅合汎兵一名，如遇險工，奔馳掩護，欲求靈活，其可得乎？（二）河防材料方面：戰前南北兩岸，遍植樹木，一望無際，就地取材，無虞匱乏，而楷料在沿河三四十里後，遇有需用，皆可隨時征集，復以修防費充裕，每年爲五十四萬元，再加搶險協款等廿餘萬元，共計七十餘萬元，向例於冬季購備材料，開春凍解，即將所有殘缺埽壩修補完整，至防汎時所需材料，亦可應手，現在沿河樹株，旣砍伐殆盡，而楷料又極感缺乏，徽集不易，且本年核定之修防費三省共僅十億元，魯省尙不足三億元，致各項材料，均不能大量存儲，較諸計劃數量，祗能購備百分之四。（三）關於防守方面；戰前沿河各縣，因河身歷年淤澱，每屆大汎，水面高於堤外地面輒達五六尺，故所有官民，皆集中力量，共同防護，沿河各縣縣長專員，且親率民夫常川駐堤，畫夜巡邏，而今則地方秩序未復，政令不能統一，修守不能統一，防護不能聯繫，壯丁相率逃亡，如遇險工，其困難實不堪想像，（四）關於電訊器材交通工員方面，防汎消息貴在靈通，戰前沿河架有長途電活，並設有無綫電台，每屆大汎，水勢工情，隨時可傳達全河。即以交通而論，沿堤汽車暢通，河內船隻櫛比，防汎期間，可集中民船數百艘之多，無論員工來往，材料運輸，均感便利，現在長途電話及河內船隻，破壞凈盡，無綫電台亦米設置，大堤亦不能通行汽本。以今比昔，何啻　壤？</p>
<p>不盡人事　潰決難免</p>
<p>隨着上列實際困難的存在，說不急起直追，速圖補救，那末轉瞬即屆的大汎期間，其潰決不僅可能，並爲絕對意料中事。且據專家調査，民國三十一年大汎時，陝州最大洪水量高至二萬八千秒立方公尺，如减去沿途消耗，流至魯境約爲一萬七千秒立方公尺，而山東河槽最大容水量僅爲八千秒立方公尺，設再不能勉盡人事，欲圖避免今年大汛時的潰決，實爲不可　的事。如在黨魯交界的劉莊董莊等處決口，可漫及舊曹州府屬一帶，下趨嘉祥濟　魚台等縣，經南陽昭陽獨山微山四湖，一路奪運河南流，一路經蘭家壩入不牢河，灌注蘇北，釀成巨災，影響導淮治運工程。如在齊東南岸決口，可漫及靑城·高苑·博與·廣　等縣，北岸決口，可漫及濟陽·惠民·濱縣。霑化·蒲台·利津·無棣等縣。</p>
<p>過去黄水爲災的原因，除掉第七次改道爲了阻遏日軍西進的抗敵戰爭以外，大多由於人謀的不　，故史學家往往視黄河爲中國治亂的象徵，也有人以黄河進至永無水患，且變害爲有利之時，即爲中國建國大業眞正吿成之日。週前中共中央黨電黄委會謂國軍於郵城（即王涸堆）以下四十里破壞河堤，業經黄委會駁斥而據軍事觀察家判斷，此甚可能爲由共阻滯魯西國軍前進準備必要時不惜決堤以圖嫁禍於人的張本。目下此舉旣非事實、山東人民所寄重望於政府的，在一切以人民利益爲前題的原則下，消極的：做到勸令中共，再不以黄河作任何職略或戰術上的工具；且進而會同中共　最大的努力增撥修防復堤費，加强河堤工程，阻遏當前危機；積極的依據薩凡奇博士，師巴德中將和葛羅同先生所擬訂的方案，根治黄河，永彌後患，使這中華民族的搖籃，中華文化的發源地，不再是「禍水」而眞能負起繼續孕育，並發揚今後億萬年的文明。</p>

<h3>私梟無罪　保安隊員罰做苦工　港政府的一件憾事</h3>
<p>— 廣州廿八日航訊　本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>粤港兩地大槪因爲過於密邇，而又是在兩個不同國家的政府管轄之下的緣故吧？彼此間不愉快的事件，彷彿樣跟着季節的轉換而不斷地發生；這究竟是中國人故意多生事端嗎？還是港政府對我們的蔑視呢？這是非和因果關係，我們暫且勿論；可是在黄水祥和張添祥血案勉可說是成爲過去，而我民衆憤慨之情仍未完全平息之際，港政府新近又製造了一件駭人聽聞的庇護私　拘留我省府保安隊隊兵並判處徒刑的事件，這不能不使我們更深深地引以爲憾了！</p>
<p>這事件的發生，是在本年二月六日，因爲粤省當局據報有許多私梟，專走私偸運糧食出口，致本省糧食發生恐慌，糧價飛漲，遂頒發緊急措施，設佈封鎖綫，以杜絕糧食偷遝出口；當時派在寳安縣沙頭角負責緝私的，是省府轄下的保安第一總隊第三大隊第十中隊，該地是粤港交界，故査緝必須特別嚴密；就在二月六日那天，該隊據綫人密報：白石洲附近一帶海面，有私梟私運穀米出口，遂即派隊兵郭湘民等四人乘小艇截緝，果見一船自白石洲開來，乃喝令停船檢査，不料該船竟開槍拒撿，且有三枝桅的大帆船一艘（船牌澳門九三二六A）及小船兩艘，協助該船以密集砲火向郭湘民等射擊，當塲擊斃郭湘民葉啓煥兩保安隊兵，其餘吳桂生等兩名及全部槍械，即被該私梟擄交英界平山警察所，後又轉解至九龍裁判所審訊。</p>
<p>要求釋放　竟置不理</p>
<p>這事發生後，粤省府便即循正當手續，向港府交涉，請其釋放捕隊兵及交還被繳槍械；怎料港政府對我要求竟置之不理。旋於三月廿二日，香港各報忽刊載一則新聞，略謂：「兩自稱保安隊隊員吳桂生等兩名昨晨在高等法庭被判罪名成立，各判入苦工獄四年時，當庭要求法官致電廣東省政府主席羅卓英氏，結果譯員囑其自行向監獄官由請；査兩被吿控之罪名有三項：（一）利用軍器攻擊他人，意圖行刦黄滿等六人而犯毆打岡刦罪；（二）蓄意毀傷他人軀體，而犯開槍射人不遂罪；（三）違法藏有短槍一枝，子彈六顆，手槍一枝，輕機槍一枝，臼砲一門，來福槍彈二三顆及手榴彈一枚，而犯懷藏軍火罪」。至於該開槍　于斃郭湘民等之私梟黄錦等六名，本來曾由主控帮辦亞斯基控其。「誤殺」及「懷藏軍火」兩罪，後港府律政司竟以爲：「保安隊之彼控罪名旣已成立，在法理上言，彼告等之誤殺當無成立可能，蓋彼等當已被認爲因自衛而開槍射擊」。於是開庭審訊時，祗控其非法懷藏長槍五枝，漁砲五門，子彈一百八十三發之罪，這樣便連所謂「誤殺」罪名，也都被取消了！</p>
<p>維護國權　伸張法經</p>
<p>這消息傳來，廣州人土，無憤慨莫名；省府亦即發表聲明稱：「二次我國保安隊兵，奉令在本國領土海面截緝走私船隻，任務正當，不容誣蔑，而私梟等竟敢開槍拒檢，復擊斃及擄去隊兵，目無法紀，掠刦武器，殊堪痛恨，本府爲維護國權，伸張法紀，現正循外交途徑向英方交涉，交回隊兵武器，並將走私拒檢行兇擄刦之三桅漁船曁一干走私人犯等引渡本省，依法究辦，諒英方當局，必能明辯是非，顧全國交，完滿解決，使事件不致擴大，粤港友誼，得以維持」。</p>
<p>派員赴港　提出交涉</p>
<p>現在，這事件交涉仍在進行中，粤省府已正式行文外交部駐港辦事處，向港督提出交涉，並派保安隊代表赴港專責辦理，雖然還沒有結果、但我們相信素以守法自矜的英國人士，斷不至於不顧人情法理，而太不尊重曾經共同生死的抗敵盟邦吧！</p>
<h3>徐州見聞</h3>
<p>— 十六日快訊　本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>狠穩蠢　談言微中</p>
<p>沂蒙山區之掃蕩戰，已在顧祝同·湯恩伯，兩將軍穩打穩紮之指揮下，順利展開，據被俘之共軍政治工作人員談，共軍高級指揮官，過去對國軍高級將領，曾作如下之一字評，如評陳誠曰「狠」，顧祝同曰「穩」，薛岳曰「猛」，劉×曰「蠢」，雖非的評，然談言微中，如新四軍之一再失利於蘇北魯南，已領略薛家軍之「猛」，如大河南北共軍所侵據之一百八十餘縣，竟在半年餘時局，爲國軍一舉光復，如徐州外圍大戰正酣之際，數萬共軍，倐忽易幟，應庖飽嘗那羽扇輕搖參謀總長之「狠」。若夫決勝津浦，收泰安於俄頃，持重魯南，困窮寇於窮山，使狼子狼奔無由，不得不歎服此「穩」如泰山之顧總司令，而趕製白旗矣。</p>
<p>孫子時代　山嶽戰爭</p>
<p>山嶽戰展開後，此一戰爭已由原子時代，退而爲孫子時代，此爲威鎭　南某名將之　語，蓋今日退據沂蒙山區之共軍，惟思保有實力，以作續命之湯，不敢據險死守，大規模之攻防戰，當不致在沂蒙山區發生，雙方均在運用孫子兵法，以求制勝，考山東羣山，在中南都之三角形山地者，總稱泰沂山脈，（即泰山·沂山）泰山位泰安縣之東北，其主峯高達一千五百四十五公尺，沂山在魯南之沂水縣西北，高僅九百九十公尺，其他如蒙陰附近之蒙山·及嶧山·尼山，雖均屬魯省名山，但高度皆不及七百公尺上述山區，有煤·鐵·玻璃等鑛產及林木，然農產物則極少，不宜久守，就目前戰局言，國軍在蒙山之搜索戰成功後·泰沂諸山殘匪之廓淸，爲時亦不致過久，因爲中國剿匪成語，雖有「山中之匪易淸，心中之匪難除」一說，但在國軍高級統帥「攻心爲上」之賢明決策下，相信山中人在小米稀飯喝光以後，一定要出來換換口味，協助國軍，來縮短這一塲可惱的戰爭。</p>
<p>泰安延安　國泰民安</p>
<p>在一週以前，當泰安，延安，相繼爲國軍收復時，前綫捷報頻傳，後方甘霖普降，太平可期，麥收有望，收復區人民之喜悅；誠無一法形容，在華北收復區鄕間人民，過去因飽受共軍蹂躪，見國軍至，多自動以食物茶水勞軍，國軍有酬以法幣或其他食物者，一般婦女，在固辭不獲收下時，嘗淚流被面訴說其過去所受之痛苦，以及共軍之罪惡，並載談載哭曰：「寗讓中央吃光，不要『八路』呌大娘」蓋甘言蜜語，爲共軍政委之特長，若輩至民家見有年事稍長之男女，即尊稱大爺，大娘，（此爲徐魯人民對伯父伯母之習稱）設所求稍有不遂，則猙獰面目，隨時暴露，故徐魯人民，聞一陌生人呼其大爺，大娘，汗毛即立刻直竪。又聞當泰安延安相繼克復後，消息傳至華北，收復區人民動色相吿曰：中央收復泰安延安，從此戰禍縮短可望國泰民安矣。可見戰區人民盼望和平之殷切，人人痛惡戰爭蘄求和平，戰禍當可縮短。泰安牧復後，蔣主席軫念戰區難民，比年因共軍肆擾，交通隔絕，飽嘗顚沛流離之苦，除諭令有關當局，赶辦收復區急賑外，並手令交部，迅速修復津浦綫臨城以北之鐵路，俾流亡難民得於今夏返回家園，從事生產，聞津浦路工務處負責人，正畫夜督工赶修，預計本月中旬，可修達滕縣，如修路所需材料，能源源運到，本年五月底，即可修達兗州，恢復徐兗段之鐵道運輸，並聞交部正竭力設法集中修路器材，從事津浦全綫之復路工程，如無意外困難，在本年九月底以前，浦口濟南間之鐵道交通，有修復之可能，浦濟交通恢復，則津浦全綫之通車，亦可期日而成，據審愼估計，本歲杪，由南京乘火車直達北平度歲，要非奢望，在舉國一致的「軍事第一，交通第一」信念下，這確是一個好消息。</p>
<p>歌聲靡靡　令人忘憂</p>
<p>大河南北戰局改觀，徐州又是一番新氣象，是月也，和風至，甘霖降，虎渡河，狼入山，殺人者死（一沙校軍官郭雨舟犯謀財害命罪伏誅）走私者抓（陸總整飭軍風紀列此爲禁條）治安須確保，馬路大翻修，食糧不許出口，（糧價近稍波動）爵士音樂可消愁，（彭城有舞榭三家，入晚舞影翩翩，歌聲靡靡，令人忘憂），大體說來，號稱兵山的大徐州，有如此現象，總算不差了。</p>

<h3>讀詩偶記</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>前人所作咏春詩，類皆平庸無新意。余讀蘇平仲句：「淸溪２郭守魚市，瘦馬尋芳踏燕泥；」及汪　句：「古原牛嚙新生草，小院蜂　乍放花，」則覺纎巧而不俗，均係未經人道者．</p>
<p>幽冥之事，類不入討，以不易得體也，詩烱章。「娉婷鬼女夜行役，漆燈照見雙履跡，土花蝕面不分明，猶帶生前小桃色。」寫荒郊見怪，令人毛戴。至唐爲垣過殤女厝棺詩：「白畫畏人依故隴，黄昏覓伴嘯孤村，」則蕭慧外尙有小女兒情態，躍然紙上也。</p>
<p>寫景易，寫情難，古今悼亡詩詞之能感人者，蓋米多覯。納蘭容若所作悼亡詞最夥，而除「此恨何時已，滴空階，寒更夜歇，葬花天氣．三載悠悠魂夢杳，是夢久應醒矣！」外，餘亦未多有動人處。沈德潛七夕感事有聯云：「只有生離無死別，果然天上勝人間，雖非直咏悼亡，而悼亡凄情，已畢露紙上；謂沈集中詩，無有過此二語者，當不虛也</p>
<p>蘇　「雙溪集，」於粤雅堂叢書中見之，所刋詩多係古律，刻意用典，無多可取。惟次韻洪六丈舍人蘇黄馬券一首，起句有：「長鳴天廐起毛龍，萬馬皆暗一洗中，其覺雄偉有力。</p>
<p>連文鳳應山爲詩，大抵淸切流麗；抒寫性靈，無宋末江湖諸人纎瑣　　之習。其自笑一聯云：「閒門事少知貧好，逆境愁多恨死遲，」意境絕脫，不落恒蹊</p>
<p>百正集中，律對喜用疊字，如湖上行春云：「好花歲歲仍相似，白　星星不再玄。」送友人歸越云：「征鴻去去秋風急，驚鵲棲棲夜月孤。」秋懷酬仇仁近見寄云「蘆荻病中秋瑟瑟，家山夢裏路綿綿。」呈趙侍郞云：「白駒皎皎猶空谷，秋水娟娟自美人。」釣臺云：「片石鄰鄰年歲晚，一絲裊裊利名空」，等是</p>
<p>農師陸佃，著「埤雅」膾炙人口，而詩名不彰，殆以所傳不多歟？方回瀛奎律髓，謂佃與胡宿，詩格相似，第宿詩傳者稍多，而佃詩則不概見。今據「陶山集」所載，尙有二百餘首，中以七言近體爲多，而次韻之作，尤佔十之七八。</p>
<p>陸佃有悼亡詩八首，其第二首結句：「佳人仙去無消息，腸斷春風一院花；」第八首結句：「徙倚暮寒襟袖薄，落花門巷月黄昏，」予以爲感人最深。</p>
<p>呂種玉「言鯖錄」：祿山爪傷楊妃乳，乃爲金詞子掩之；金訶子亦名訶梨子。予於十七齡時，塡桃源憶放人咏浴，其上半闋云：「華淸初罷銀屏裏，撩亂鬢雲斜墜，翠袂蟬衫褪處，隱約訶梨住。」即用此事。但初學塡詞，律多不卟，而意又佻薄如此，可嗤也。</p>
<p>陳與義以：客予光陰２卷裏，杏花消息雨聲中」句，爲高宗所賞，遂馴至執政；在南渡諸詩人中，最爲顯遠，高迪以富詞：「小大隔花空吠影，夜深宮禁有誰來？」二語　禍，至於殺身，初非詩詞之工拙，乃帝王之氣度不同也，劉靜修詩：「若將文字論心術，恐有無邊受屈人，」眞長者之言。</p>
<p>簡齋五律，以雨爲題者最多，而詩亦以題雨者最勝。「一時花帶淚，萬里客憑欄，」「古澤生春　，高空落暮　」諸聯，皆極工麗。即尋常詩句中，亦每喜用雨字，如酴醵一首有：「雨過無桃李，」試院書懷有「疎疎一簾雨，」岸續有：「細雨濕靑林，」道中有：「雨子收還急，」晚步有：「雨餘山欲近，」類此者不勝　舉。</p>
<p>山靜居詩話載：豆村老人一生以詩爲計，日必有作，作必存稿，年逾耄　，不廢吟哦。又極自珍秘，所作等身，懸之屋梁，非至交不輕示，可謂耽詩成癖者矣。所錄佳句中，余最愛　聯，「買花不計錢多少，留客都忘米有無，」及「瓶花無恙煩蜂探，鄰竹多情走筍來，」神韻秀澹如許！</p>
<p>去非陳與義，有　薩蠻咏荷花云：「南軒面對芙蓉浦，宜風宜月還宜雨；」吾松黄唐堂咏楊花詩云：「不宜風裏宜雨裏，未見開時見落時。」一詞一詩，均以風雨着筆，妥切自然，各臻妙境。</p>
<p>陳枚爰立，詩雖未曾名家，而其詩論則多至理。其言有云：「詩以溫厚蘊藉爲體，以風雅鼓盪爲用。思入深沉，調出俊爽。宏麗詩不落濃俗，幽靜詩不落枯淡。雄句宜渾，不宜組；婉句宜細，不宜巧。一觀意思，二觀體裁，三觀句調，四觀神韻；四者皆備，方爲全詩。四者中更以意思神韻爲主。一</p>
<p>曾弗人與趙十五論詩書云：「弟嘗謂古詩難於律詩，五言律難於七言律。杜詩七律無不奇妙者，至五言，平率高古，遂已參半。惟王孟五律妙於七言，殆有天授。譬則陶令爲五言大神品時，固未有七言之體；即有，而陶爲之亦未必不亞於五言要未可謂五言之較易也。」持論允當，非於（詩學有造詣者，不克道此。</p>
<p>朱曉亭悼查韜荒詩云：「路旁香草露路中花，采采其如秋望賒，哀些欲招無處所，不知雲雨散誰家？三閭死後屬靑蓮，之子高名亦與傳，自古才人多好色，才人未有不神仙。」蓋韜荒晚歲游茶陵，頗有所眷，而死於其家者；曉亭此詩，閔之，亦諷之也。梁溪閨秀鄒瑗，有遺集「亦南　小　」行於世。其詩旨格　遠，不慕華貴。余尤愛其登焦山頂一律：「盤螺漸上碧雲梯，萬木森森寺逕迷，古渡遙連瓜步瞑，危極横　海門低；屐黏石磴蒼苔滑，杖掛烟轟濕翠齊，欲問華陽眞逸事，江陽又擁夕陽西。」</p>
<p>丙子四月，勤昌金兄與予同遊揚州瘦西湖，歸途得「夕陽紅過五亭橋」句，予以爲與洪北江初到西湖所作「夕陽紅透紫羅紗」有同一意境。</p>
<p>憇鎭江焦山別峯庵，偶憶北江詩句：「鷹同獺占東西嶺，浪與人爭出沒舟，」鷹獺，今已不復棲息四山，而滂　沆讀，則仍有浪與人爭之勢也。</p>
<p>一自椿董見背，余即畏讀陟岵　莪諸詩。續劉向說苑所裁皋魚言，亦爲之晞噓者再。近讀「拜經樓詩話」所錄宋林子眞孝詩如干首，如咏范滂云：「寗將身塞禍，不忍母流離，我自不爲惡，黄泉今有辭，」詩雖不工，然以出乎至情，亦曾濟焉下泪。</p>
<p>俗例七夕月下，仕女爭以鳳仙搗爛，塗染指甲，傳爲韻事。詩人亦往往以染甲入詩、頃見　靜庵一絕云：「金盤和露搗晴　，紅透纎纖玉笋牙，翠袖籠香理遙瑟，綠陰新綻海棠花。」朱詩實奪胎於楊鐵崖詩：「夜搗守宮金鳳蕊，十尖盡換紅鴉觜，閒來一曲鼓瑤琴，數點桃花泛流水。」邢慈靜一絕云：「指如玉筍里如銀，巧染鮮紅眞可羨，閒撥瑤琴向　窗，綵絃亂落桃花片。」按兩家均係閩秀，朱有「自怡集，」邢有「芝蘭寳集，」各負詩名。余於十七齡時，學譜鵲橋仙咏染甲云：「麝噴金鴨，烟添蘭燄，金鳳飛殷深砌。凌波步向小庭間，便輕把柔荑試綴。</p>
<p>朱欄纔倚，銀箏又理，片片桃花飛墜。幾回漫想托香顋，還疑是芳顏酡醉。「意似本於兩家，然詞筆則　樨浮淺，不足齒也</p>
<h3>詩人與花</h3>
<p>— 荺毅</p>
<p>花對於我們的生活太有關係了。我們不能想像，假使這宇宙中沒有了花，我們將覺得怎樣。我們的生活被我們四周的美麗的花所裝飾，美化，活潑，但我們始終不發覺它們的影響。只有詩人感到它的神力，高興替它們寫</p>
<p>在詩人中間，濟慈和丁尼生對於花特別有興趣。他們用花來增加描寫的生動力，表現的眞實性，且藉此宣洩他們的情感與幽思。但，讀了濟慈和丁尼生的詩之後，我們發現他們二人雖都愛花，他們在花之美所受的影響却是不同的</p>
<p>濟慈喜愛花的官感之美。當他看到美麗的花的時候，他突然感到愛悅了：</p>
<p>「威爾司呀！玫瑰到眼前來了，</p>
<p>我的感覺被它的芬芳迷倒了。」</p>
<p>他是一個抽象的美的崇拜者。他認爲「美」中有「眞」，所以他一看見美的花，也看見了其中的眞：</p>
<p>「它們有累聲低訴的言辭，眞理，以及深摯的友誼。」</p>
<p>至於丁尾生，花常使他想　另外的東西。因此，與其說他在欣賞美，母寗說他在解釋美：</p>
<p>「採了尕延命菊，拿來給你，</p>
<p>它會告訴你我所見到的英吉利。」</p>
<p>他在雪珠花上想到春的到來</p>
<p>「在冷的時候來，快樂的季節的先知，五月的先知。」</p>
<p>他看見延命菊變成紅色，便相信有人走過：</p>
<p>「我知道她拿着花球走回家去的路，</p>
<p>因爲她的脚擦過草地才使延命菊變成殷紅。」</p>
<p>無論如何，這兩位詩人對於花有着同樣的熱情。濟慈這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「花上嗅著他新的热情，</p>
<p>吿訴他在幸福的世界裏我已有了你。」</p>
<p>丁尼生呢，好像對於花的熱情更趨强烈了：</p>
<p>「我不能有，不能有一　花嗎？</p>
<p>倘若自然不顧到</p>
<p>花兒的開放，</p>
<p>誰能活一片刻？</p>
<p>我在死前總要看花！」</p>
<p>我們知道了花對於濟慈與丁尼生有怎樣的影響以及他們被引起什麽反應之後，不妨再看看這兩位詩人怎樣利用花。</p>
<p>濟慈比丁尼生更多談到花的官感之美，他以爲隨便一個地方有了花便美麗了：</p>
<p>「山是美麗的，你看，櫻草都出來了。」</p>
<p>就是呌他單單着花，他也會得到無比的快樂。他一生中所受的最大快樂便是花之生長：</p>
<p>「什麽有如此可愛，像那小蜜蜂，</p>
<p>在盛開的花上稍作停留？」</p>
<p>當他在狂放的時候，他喜歡同花在一起：</p>
<p>「我的血在狂熱的時候愛把我的頭枕在玫瑰的香氣一裏。」</p>
<p>「我暈倒在花床上，昏昏然醉了三天。」</p>
<p>他在有花的地方便高興起來</p>
<p>「我們的脚在花中變成溫柔了。</p>
<p>那邊山上藏着最新的幸福。</p>
<p>有時候</p>
<p>一股丁香的香氣，一簇開着的花，</p>
<p>在我們四周浮動，還有蜂巢。</p>
<p>因白的花朶而馥郁了。」</p>
<p>你看，他一見美麗的阿芙蓉花多感動。</p>
<p>「穿過這舞踊着的阿芙蓉花，</p>
<p>溜來了一陣徴風，撫慰着我的靈魂，又在我眼前造成</p>
<p>色彩的幻景，」</p>
<p>另一面，丁尼生對花之美有他特殊的感覺，美只激動他內在的感覺，而非外在的：</p>
<p>「玫瑰的靈魂走進我的血裏，」</p>
<p>「丁香的氣息，躱在草裏</p>
<p>傾入我虛空的靈魂與身體。」</p>
<p>「一切都如我花之清明潔白嗎？」</p>
<p>丁尼生的另一特色是他使花人性化，如例：</p>
<p>「花在甜蜜的痛苦中，</p>
<p>把她們的眼睛抬到水泡上面，</p>
<p>像我們的皇后那樣。」</p>
<p>如果我們知道丁尼生是濟慈的學生的話，那麽他們對於花都有相似的興趣便不足爲怪了。花之美使濟慈想到了「美即眞，眞即美」；但却使丁尼生想起了他的愛人，他的故鄕，他的快樂的靑春時代。前者有對於美的奔放的熱情；後者有對於美的反省的想索。顯然，丁尼生比濟慈更實際了。由此看來，同是花之美，給二位詩人的影嚮却是不同的。</p>
<p>另一件値得注意的事，是這二位詩人對於各種花有各種態度。爲他們所共愛的花爲攻瑰，百合，丁香，延命菊以及櫻草。這些花的象徵則是：攻瑰象愛情與快樂；百合象純潔；丁香象幽靜；延命菊與櫻草象輕快。他們認爲攻瑰是花中最寳貴的花，因爲玫瑰是愛之標記。</p>
<p>硏究濟慈與丁尼生對於花的興趣及處理，在我認爲，不會是沒有價値的事。他們都深深愛着花，可以說見花即喜的；但對於花的觀感略見不同。這一點，據我想來，一定是由於不同的人格典型的緣故。濟慈是個純粹的羅曼主羣者，丁尼生是維多利亞時代的，因此，他們自然以不同的眼光去看花了。</p>
<p>他們的愛花使他們的詩有了美麗的岡畫，而在讀他們的詩的時候，使我們知道用一種新的眼光去愛花，去欣賞花。（譯自「不列顚文摘」第一期）</p>
<h3>風景</h3>
<p>— 洗湼克</p>
<p>洗湼克（Panul　signac　1862）也是新印象派（即雖彩派）的創導者，他的　魄比修拉（Scurat）還要，不像修拉那樣拘束於形式的幽美和講究筆觸的均勻。他用筆，搆圖，色彩都較簡單而奔放，筆觸很少重疊，筆觸與筆觸之間喜留出空隙（畫布原色），望去有苦中世紀敎堂壁上的「莫薩衣克」一樣；所作風景頗有東方畫的趣味。其影響於後代甚大，如後期印象派的郭賀等都是受其啓示的。這張風景，可算是代表之作。（獅）</p>
<h3>論王个簃</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>回憶二十年前，書畫金石巍然樹一幟，鑒賞家羅致，珍如拱璧，學者風靡，視爲規臬者，當推安吉吳昌碩矣。昌碩書畫，得金石之助，昌碩金石，又得書畫之力，融會變化，大氣旁薄。倪雲林嘗稱王黄鶴謂：叔明筆力能扛鼎，五百年來無此君。以昌碩之氣魄，直能扛鼎而有餘裕，實爲淸季三百年中所未見。</p>
<p>當時海內學者，醉心於昌碩盛名，以爲租枝大葉，紛紅駭綠，便可得昌碩三昧。於是調脂弄鉛，爭相仿傚，風起雲湧，盛極一時。致使世人對昌碩之畫，發生不良印象，斥爲海派，轉貽昌碩盛名之累，昌碩亦嘗以學者之盲從效顰爲苦！然就其學昌碩而能其神韵者，亦頗不乏人，北有陳師曾，南有王个簃。（齊白石亦以學昌碩而起家，但頗諱言昌碩）。</p>
<p>師會天分學力，均極佳妙，惜年未五十即下世。至於个簃則强記力學，根深蒂固，得昌碩薪傳，堪稱昌老入室弟子中第一人。詩文金石書畫，無一不工。其書其畫，即以其詩文金石爲根底，用是渾厚樸實，寓俊秀書卷於　辣蒼茫中，極饒簡練閎肄之致。其文則取法史漢，兼采韓歐兩家，詩乃李杜蘇黄，各家咸備、洵爲時下藝苑中全才也。</p>
<p>个簃兼嗜收藏，尤愛揚州八怪，趙之謙，任伯年輩作品，蓋昌老作風，即由趙任蛻化而來，探本追源，个簃之愛趙任，亦猶學　台而溯烟客耳。个簃在此二十年來，篤守斯道，專心致志，愈久愈勤，愈勤而成功亦愈大。个　鑒於近頃藝壇對昌老一派之漸趨冷落，重長宋風，个簃實有發揚光大之責，乃自四月二十三日起假座寗波同鄕會畫龐，舉行作品展覺一星期，使社會人士，正目而視，瞭解我國書畫藝術之妙　，至精且微，亦至廣且泛，數　年來任其南王北李，徐黄異體，系統紛繁，流派雜陳，而神韵　一度，有其一貫之精神，筆墨意境，異途同歸，寫情寫景，均足以發輝我民族獨特之風格。更藉此展覽而使世人知昌碩一派之作風，由來有自，蒼動渾厚，自有其足傳之道。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血403</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「哈，你要想想你從小到大，受的甚麽敎育，受的甚麽薰陶－「只知有已」，「夜郞自大」；此外就是『服從』；不是「自己」一帮的，好像都是不應該的；不「服從」，等於犯罪？……守一竟是這等不客氣，指明了鶴見的錯誤成見。</p>
<p>鶴見負起手來，在屋子里來回走了兩度，陡然站住，瞧着守一；「老大哥，你的話絕對正確，奇怪我以前麽沒有這樣的邏輯？老是巴不得聚集所有的人才，在一個指揮之下，共同進行，——當然不一定我就是這個指揮－……</p>
<p>「慢着？」守一打斷了　見的話頭，「可要明白，這個方式，一聲　不好，就有極大的危險－……</p>
<p>「我明瞭！」鶴見也不讓守一發揮下去。一在一個共同大目標之下，各集團自由活動。遇有必要。只要意見一致，一個通知，大家合力並進，共趨一點……是不是？」</p>
<p>「可是，危險在哪裏呢？「守一考問着鶴見。</p>
<p>「當然是怕的小集團『故步自封』，表示獨特，彼此此長，閙意見，爭權利，等等，等等。…」</p>
<p>「不！」守一揮着手，止住觀見，「你提出的這些毛病，超出了「同志分工合作』範圍之外，當然也對。我的意思，凡够資格　當聯絡的集團，似乎不應當有這些毛病。至於我說的「危險」，乃是技術的：譬如今天，不是技術設備上的便利，我目前恐怕已經上南京去了。那邊的事，也緊急得很。現在因從種種報吿上參詳，知道這裏的緊急和重要性，不比南京小，並且解決了這裏，等於解決南京方面的問題，所以我們莊上，凡準備去參加南京行動的，全體都停止了進行，專候我的消息咧…」</p>
<p>「所以你才肯這們提早趕來？」鶴見的宰情上，有些酸溜溜地。</p>
<p>「也是爲了要會會你，自從正岩提起你種種行爲之後」。守一表示了心跡；用了這自然礆性的誠意，把鶴見那莫明其妙的酸性中和了。</p>
<p>這兩位靑年，談得熱情奔放，幾乎把這火的正題目都鬧的不記得了。然而沒有這一度熱情奔放的談話，以後天南地北，各行其是，正不知要到哪年哪月，才能聯繫起來哩。</p>
<p>「我有一個好奇的問題，想請敎你一下，」鶴見仍舊不想提到目前的緊急問題</p>
<p>「什麼一問題？」</p>
<p>「慢着」，鶴見又想到另外一件事了；「讓我先把你剛才提到的「技術」問題，說明「下」。</p>
<p>「很好」。</p>
<p>聯絡的技術，第一重要，當然是消息靈通。消息一靈通，就可免除一切隔閡，更能消滅誤會。同時彼此有所要求，也無需媒介轉達，直接就可傳遞。…」</p>
<p>「這是很好的方式。」守一注意鶴見的下文。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>國粹與外匯</h3>
<p>— 常楚</p>
<p>某報載稱，若干古董巨商，正在北平上海等地，搜集我數千年來之歷史文物，運往美國出售，以套取美金外匯，並說，本市關心文物的人士，已聯絡古物保管委員會和海關，設法加以阻止，以免我國重要文物，流落外邦。看了這個消息，幾個朋友都不免搖頭太息一番。可是有一個人說了：</p>
<p>一楚有楚得，現在是天下一家了，天下之人失之，天下之人得之，何可借之有」？</p>
<p>又一個人說：</p>
<p>「這究竟是我們的國粹，幾千年老祖宗傳下來的遺產，怎麽可以斷送給外人呢」？</p>
<p>「把國粹販賣出去的不是今朝一日更不是今日一人，你不道知連幽默大師都在販賣嗎」？</p>
<p>「幽默大師祗是宣揚國粹，並未販賣，宣揚祗有江郞才盡，改業機器製造之日，販賣則有傾家蕩產，無物可賣之時」。</p>
<p>「國粹我所欲也，外匯亦我所欲也，兩者不可得而兼，舍國拌而取外匯者也　一。</p>
<p>「你眞是一個惟利是圖的東西」！一位太太開口駡人了。</p>
<p>「沒有外匯你怎麼能有美國貨的唇膏和香水，怎麽能有ＲＣＡ旅行無綫電到杭州遊春還帶着跑」？</p>
<p>「說起杭州，眞的，要是沒有那無綫電隨時收聽收聽，可不要悶死人了」？</p>
<p>「我記得最使你氣悶的，就是在博物館裏看古董的時候」。</p>
<p>「古董自然不能和山水相比」。</p>
<p>「古董又那裏能和外匯相比」？</p>
<p>「外國人要的是古董］我們要的是外匯，以有易無，皆大歡喜，豈不是猗　于盛哉」！</p>
<p>吵到這裏，有一位先生又讀報了。他說行總署長霍寳樹視察黄汎區歸來，據稱那邊赤地千里，渺無人烟，黄沙有數尺之深，幾乎。又成了一片新的沙漠。他說：</p>
<p>「倘然問問那一帶流」出去的老百姓，究竟我們要不要國粹，要不要外匯，那才是眞正的答案了」！</p>
<p>是麼？在座的人又閙哄哄爭吵起來了。</p>
<h3>中國——世界之謎？</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>摘錄一個新聞：</p>
<p>（中央一日紐約電）堪薩斯明星副總編輯自東方）歸來。頃播述關於中國之專論。開即曰：「中國仍爲世界最大之謎，中國有極多相互衝突之力量共同作，其表面上顯露之恨亂與崩潰之危機，均足使人迷惑。」</p>
<p>其實，這又是老調新彈。好久以前，有一位外國作家在發掘了中國的神秘之餘，回去吿訴別人道：中國是自獨輪車，人力車，轎車，馬車，汽車，以至於火車，無所所不包，無所不有的。他的意思當然不單是指車子，無論任何事物，中國有着新的一面，也有落後的一面。所以，有摩登女郞的尼隆高跟鞋，則也有她母親的三寸金運。有小姐少奶奶們主持的擲瓶禮，則也有苗　的吃人祭。有最新翻譯的Leonar　Engele的「世界末日戰爭」，則也有劉伯溫的「推背圖」。有新到拷貝，色彩絢爛的「出水芙蓉」，却也有鄉間的羊皮紙戲。這一切都是事實。而這事實說明的是什麽呢？是是說中國還在新舊遞變中，在新舊鬥爭中。而新的未必全部美好，舊的也未必全部醜惡；鬥爭的結局，是要達到最高度的「善」。</p>
<p>中國　進步，是在新舊的鬥爭中東的。一神秘的中國一，「謎一樣中國」，「中國事情，不一定也許就是一定」，等等，只是若干洋客眼裏的中國印象，以發掘國際「內幕」著稱的約翰，根室，對中國的看法也只能到此而止，則何况只在中國若干地區蹓了一趙的堪薩斯明星的副總編輯乎？</p>
<p>然而拆穿了，這所謂謎其實也不難於打破。中國之「不易了解」，原因正如所說，這是地方太大，人口太多，歷史太長，文字太深之故，而尤緊要者，這有三千年歷史的中國，正在革命改造之中。</p>
<p>中國的無所不包與無所不有，說明了這塊園地的蕪雜。也正由於太蕪雜，整個中國社會還在革命改造中，還在提鍊中。要了解中國，空間的觀光是必要的，硏究一下紀錄時間的痕迹的歷史，尤屬必要，有人說·中國是方塊字的犧牲者；有人說，中國是因循，敷衍，馬虎哲學的集其大成者；也有人說，中國被玄學所拖累，成爲玄學鬼的樂園了。這些話都有理，也都只看到了眞相的一面。</p>
<p>値得憂慮的不是中國的「蕪雜」，而是山國人的進化過程。</p>
<p>猛人一被淸客所包圍，立刻變成籠中的動物標本了；革命志士稍稍嘗了點甜頭，立刻發通電，草宣言，當起人生舞台上的丑角來了。眞正的戰士；實在百不得一。因此，少年越超時代，中年跟着時代，老年拖住時代，就成爲大多數人的「進化過程」。</p>
<p>這是可悲的。如果這種情形不改變，中國的「神秘」也將成爲它的悲劇的象徵了。</p>
<h3>名字太多</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>大學女生甲：爲什麼敎授點名的時候你不留心聽聽他呌什麽名字？</p>
<p>大學女生乙：我倒是留心聽了的，可是他答應了四個人的名字。</p>
<h3>奧遜威爾與克勞黛考爾白在「春　淚痕」中</h3>
<h3>傅逆說佚聞</h3>
<p>— 魯氏</p>
<p>杭有某君，其戰前與傳逆有詩酒之雅，（傅工詩嗜飲）迨傅變節，出任僞浙江省長，某遂絕通問，旋傳兼充偽太湖東南地區淸鄉辦事處主任，設僞處於嘉興，忽訪得某潛隱杭鄕，貽書致聘。某作復云：「得書知想念故人，私情可感，公義難言，世亂憂煩，吟興久廢，遙聞足下於烟雨讀頭，置酒高會，臨流　槊，不可無詩，爰錄吳梅邨鴛湖曲一首，聊以將意。」按鴛湖曲結句：「世間苦難皆陳迹，年去年來堪痛惜，聞笛休差石季倫，啣盃且效降彭澤。君不見白浪滔天一葉危？收竿猶恐轉船遲，人生無限風波苦，輸與江湖釣叟知！」蓋諷其及早抽身也。傅得　惘然不怡，而徘徊顧睹，不能自拔，卒至身陷大僇，貽百世羞，悲夫。</p>
<h3>「不會走路」論</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>車輛增多，道路窄小，不論你請了美國專家來研究也好，不論你停發人力車老虎車的照會也好，就現有的道路，已經不能容納現有的車輛，因此前時幾條洋辦法，今天採用綫的管理，都沒有减輕淤塞的現象。因爲淤塞，所以車輛的失事也就劇增，安步當車於街頭，眞有「馬路如虎口」之感，最近鬧着的德士古油公司卡車輾斃交大一學生的事件其遠因也基此。自然如司機所供的煞車不靈，以及高速度行車，也爲失事的主要原因。不過因此匪夷所思的說車輛失事十九皆爲行路者不會走路之故，這是頗爲令人奇怪的。</p>
<p>外人對國人的批評，誠然不少，不過批評中國人連走路都不會，這倒還十分新鮮的。似乎吃醉了酒，將吉普開到人行道去的情形也是常有的，是不是也大可振振有詞的說行人撞碰車子，給他加上一個自殺的帽子呢？好在司機還算忠厚，他供出車子有煞車不靈的毛病，不然，輾斃的交大學生賈子聯硬是不會走路了。</p>
<p>其實說不會走路，倒不如說爲什麼中國人不能像美國人四個人平均有一輛自備車子更好。在我們，路是最會走的，在這樣一個父通建設遺沒有達到要求的都市裏，每一個走在馬路的行人沒有統統被輾死，可見中國人是着實能走的。祗是沒有一種天賦的勁兒來與速度旣高，煞車又壞的卡車對撞吧了。</p>
<p>爲了防患未然，在筆者很想向德士古油公司建議，不妨向有關方面要求，凡德士古油公司之車輛一律予以救火車與急救車之待遇，這樣，不但無刑事責任，連五千萬治喪費也可切不要「發落」的。</p>
<h3>介紹「春閨淚痕」</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>「春關淚痕」和「風流種子」「柔腸寸斷」一樣，由男女的愛推廣到父母對子女的愛，我說過一柔腸寸斷」的後半部比「風流種子」更令人哭泣。如今「春閨淚痕」的後半部却比「柔腸寸斷」還要凄惶。「自君別後」「民族至上」令人不滿，於是我珍視「春閨淚痕」的一份悲愴，好久沒有着過這樣的悲劇了呢，看戲中大雨滂沱，雪花霏霏，多少人哭了。</p>
<p>導演默文潘茜爾，早年曾導演雷門諾伐羅的羅曼蒂克作品，戰時以「月落烏啼霜滿天」馳名，他最光印人我們印象中的獨創作品是「邊邊城壯士」，其後從「新生」「諜報敢死團」到這張「春閨淚痕」，氣魄的增強顯然可見，手法的有力和氛圍的操縱俱有値得注意的成績，尤其是男主人公死亡到結束的處理，入木三分。　，演員方面，奧遜威爾的沉毅得以充分發揮，克勞黛考爾白再一次敎我們堅信她是好萊塢唯一足以抵禦　格　褒曼的女星；兩位童星應應加推　，一是十七幾狄克期，飾兒子一角，一是六歲的娜蒂兒伍德，飾奧籍養女一角，她在結尾的突聲使人黯然神傷。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「人多車不够裝我是知道的。可是昨天我已答應過胡太太了，老諸，你不能讓我失信！」末了，她才想到了一個正受寵愛的女人對佬男人的唯一方法——撤嬌。於是她装怪生氣似的望床上一坐，　　嘴。嘮嘮叨叨地說：「你不是說什麽聽我的話嗎？這一些小事你也不肯，還請其他？我不管，胡太太的事你得給她想辦法………！」</p>
<p>說到末了，她倒眞有些泫然欲涕的樣子。諸老頭兒倒不曾防到這一個向來綿羊似的柔馴慣的金愛麗忽然會跟他麻煩起來，可是他也知道前幾天金愛麗一直是和蘭同住在徐紹明的家裏的，並且兩個人相處得很好，金愛麗也一再跟他提到過這位胡太太，以及她那兩個孩子，所以他倒絕不懷疑這是爲了老祝的緣故。</p>
<p>「協座，帮帮忙吧！」祝兆年冷眼地看到老諸的臉上已漸漸透出了躊躇的神氣，知道事情已有轉機，便急着用話帮襯。「這一會的事我祝兆年心，，最明白，你如果肯在無辦法　給他們想出辦法來，眞　帮我自己的忙還要感激！」</p>
<p>諸老頭兒又遲疑了一二分鐘，赤鼻子上書出好幾顆汗珠。</p>
<p>「那末，那末這樣：」他期期艾艾地說，有一些打不定主意。」一個大人兩個孩子，我的小包車上實在坐不下，最多搭一位。其餘…………</p>
<p>「其餘怎麽樣？」祝兆年絲毫不敢放鬆。視綫直射在對方的瞳人上。</p>
<p>但沒有用諸老頭兒的心房，早在三四十年前已給權和利的慾念封閉了起來，偶然例外地帮人家一次無代價的忙還可以，如果超出這個限度，那他是死也不會答應的。</p>
<p>「其餘過一兩天再想辦法。」他語音一很堅決地說，但臉上依舊掛着怪動人的假笑。</p>
<p>今天我們小是就要走了嗎？像老祝同樣失望的金愛　又竭力鼓足勇氣，帮上這麽一句</p>
<p>對於他這位新寵的今天如此不知趣，老諸眞覺得有些怫然了。</p>
<p>「這有什麽問題？」他偸偸地向金愛麗瞪了一眼。「我走了公司裏還有人在這兒，祝先生隨時可以跟他們接洽　。不成問題的！不成問題的！」他又笑容可　地　　說上兩句，意思是要老祝自己知難而退。（四）（一）</p>

<h3>Revision of National Government and Executive Yuan Organization Laws Promulgated; Government Committee to Convene First Meeting in Nanjing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The National Government issued an order on the 22nd: The revised Articles 1 and 15 of the Organization Law of the National Government of the Republic of China are hereby promulgated. This order.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The 66th meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held on the morning of the 21st, after the Central Joint Memorial Week, in the conference room of the Central Party Headquarters. President Chiang himself presided over the meeting and passed the revised Articles 1 and 15 of the Organization Law of the National Government of the Republic of China as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The National Government, based on the provisions of Article 77 of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, hereby enacts the Organization Law of the National Government of the Republic of China as a special measure for the transition from political tutelage to constitutional government.</p>
<p>Article 15: The President and Vice President of the Five Yuan of the National Government shall be selected and appointed by the Chairman of the National Government. (Note: The latter part of the article, "The Chairman of the National Government is responsible to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China, and the Presidents of the Five Yuan are responsible to the Chairman of the National Government," has been deleted).</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Organization Law of the National Government and the Organization Law of the Executive Yuan have recently been revised and promulgated by the National Government. It is reported that the Executive Yuan Organization Law promulgated this time is a revision of the existing Executive Yuan Organization Law, in order to adapt to the transitional environment from political tutelage to constitutional government. As for the Organization Laws of the Five Yuan, which were previously formulated and promulgated by the National Government in preparation for the implementation of the constitution, the date of their implementation will be determined separately according to the progress of constitutional preparation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] After the Joint Conference of the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Committee passed the amendment to the Organization Law of the National Government, the government immediately notified the Nanjing Office of the Democratic Socialist Party, which relayed the message via long-distance telephone to party members in Shanghai. Therefore, the newly appointed Government Committee members from the Democratic Socialist Party, Hu Haimen and Ji Yiqiao, have scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing on the 21st. Xu Fulin will meet with them before going to Shanghai. Xu's participation in the Government Committee issue will only be decided after discussions in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a routine meeting on the morning of the 22nd, which will still be presided over by Chiang in his capacity as Acting President of the Yuan. The newly appointed President of the Yuan, Zhang Qun, is scheduled to take office on the 24th. The appointment orders for the Vice President of the Yuan, Wang Yunwu, and the Secretary-General, Gan Naiguang, have not yet been announced and may be decided at the first Government Committee meeting on the 23rd. However, the current Secretary-General, Jiang Menglin, is scheduled to cease working at the Yuan on the 24th. The Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 22nd will be held at the National Government, and the important agenda items include: (1) Approval of the Sino-Argentine Treaty of Friendship, (2) Supervisory measures for county and city finances by county and city councils before local autonomy is completed, and (3) Organizational regulations for Lanzhou and other cities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Lei Zhen, together with Hu Haimen and Ji Yiqiao, members of the National Government Committee from the Democratic Socialist Party, and He Luzhi, a member of the National Government Committee from the Youth Party, took the 11:00 PM train to Nanjing last night. Hu, Zhan and He are going to Beijing to attend the first meeting of the National Government Committee to be held on the 23rd. Wu Xianzi, another member of the National Government Committee from the Democratic Socialist Party, is scheduled to fly from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 23rd. Lei had a meeting with opposition figures from the Democratic Socialist Party yesterday, and it is believed that all disputes can be resolved after Wu Xianzi arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Person Responsible to the Chairman Should Be the National Assembly for Constitution-Making; Proposal Passed by the Research Committee of the Constitutional Promotion Association</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Research Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held its first meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM on the 21st. Thirty-three committee members attended, chaired by Vice President Mo Dehui. The meeting passed the research work plan and methods for group research, and then discussed proposals. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The conveners of the association reconvened at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to organize the resolutions of the morning's general meeting and adjourned at 5:30 PM. At the general meeting on the 21st, the association passed a proposal submitted by Committee Member Chen Huanzhang and 57 others stating that the Organization Law of the National Government should stipulate that the Chairman of the National Government is responsible to the National Assembly for Constitution-Making. The explanation of the proposal is as follows: The Organization Law of the National Government was originally based on the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, which authorized the Kuomintang of China to be responsible for political tutelage. Therefore, the Chairman of the National Government was produced by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China, and it was not inappropriate to be responsible to the Central Executive Committee that produced him. Now that the new government organization law has been promulgated, changing from one-party political tutelage to multi-party governance, its task is to complete the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution. Therefore, although the Chairman of the National Government was originally produced by the Kuomintang, his task has entered a new stage, and the person he is responsible to should be all the people, not just one party, the Kuomintang, and even less so only the parties participating in the government. Moreover, the National Assembly for Constitution-Making includes the participation of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites. Furthermore, the term of office of the National Assembly representatives extends to the date of the next National Assembly meeting, which is clearly stated in the preparatory procedures for constitutional implementation. Since the government has declared the return of power to the people, and the Organization Law of the National Government has been revised and promulgated, the Chairman should not be responsible to the party but should be responsible to the National Assembly for Constitution-Making to maintain the rule of law and solidify the foundation of the country.</p>

<h3>Reforming the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank into Publicly Owned Banks; National Defense Council Re-deliberates; Submits Specific Principles to the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The draft legislative principles for the Central Bank Law and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank are currently being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. In addition to the Central Bank, the Legislative Yuan advocates that the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank be completely reformed into publicly owned banks, with all capital allocated by the national treasury. Chairman Chiang of the National Defense Council originally believed that this was not necessary at present and should be reconsidered. He put forward three opinions and handed them over to the Financial, Economic, and Legal Affairs Committees of the Council for deliberation. The committees have complied with the deliberation and put forward specific principles at the National Defense Council meeting on the 21st, and they have been passed by the general meeting and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Chairman's opinions are recorded as follows: (1) The recently promulgated Economic Emergency Measures Program is planning to sell some state-owned enterprises to the private sector by issuing stocks. Now that the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank have had people's shares for a long time, it would be contradictory in policy to order them to withdraw their shares. (2) If shareholders are ordered to withdraw their shares, the share capital cannot be returned according to the original amount before the war; if it is based on the ratio of prices to currency value, it will involve even more and easily cause disputes. (3) The proportion of commercial shareholders (including some legal entities) is limited, and most of the directors and supervisors are appointed by the government. All management measures can be carried out in accordance with national policies and will not be affected by commercial shareholders. Based on these three points, it is not appropriate to completely abolish commercial shares in the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank at present.</p>
<h3>National Defense Council Passed the Legislative Principles of the Three Banks Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The National Defense Council passed the legislative principles for the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank on the 21st. The three banks are roughly similar. The capital is divided into public shares and non-public shares, and the latter shall not exceed 40% of the total. The funds used for major business operations shall not be less than 70%. Each bank shall have 25 directors, 9 executive directors, 1 chairman, 9 supervisors, and 1 standing supervisor. The general manager (one for each bank) and the deputy general manager (one to two for each bank) shall be full-time and shall be selected by the chairman in consultation with the executive directors from those with financial theory and banking business experience. They shall be appointed with the consent of the board of directors and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval. As for the main business of the three banks, the Bank of China handles financial business for international trade and international exchange, the Bank of Communications handles financial business for industrial and mining, transportation, and public utilities, and may issue industrial bonds with the special approval of the National Government. The China Farmers Bank handles financial business for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, reclamation, water conservancy, and land improvement, and may also handle land financial business and issue agricultural bonds and land bonds with the special approval of the National Government.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Nantoutou Paper Mill's Robbed Machinery Can Be Shipped Back</h3>

The provincial government has decided to hand over the factory to the Industrial Company for operation. However, the original site of the factory has been destroyed, and a large amount of funds is required for construction, transportation of machinery, and purchase of equipment and raw materials. It has been decided to welcome overseas Chinese investment. When the factory's machinery was ordered from Sweden in 1933, the value of the machinery itself reached 211,870 British pounds. The production rate is 50 tons of newsprint per day, and can be increased to a maximum of 100 tons. At the same time, it can produce 20 tons of sulphite pulp and 30 tons of mechanical pulp per day, and can use wood pulp to produce rayon. After the factory resumes operation in the future, not only will this province not need to import foreign paper, but it can also supply the southeastern provinces.</p>

<h3>Filipino Chinese Stallholders Win Lawsuit: Primary Court Rules Ban on Stallholders Ineffective, Finance Minister, etc. Prohibited from Executing Department of Finance's Previously Issued Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] Chinese stallholders in the markets here have won an initial victory in their struggle to maintain their livelihood. Manila Primary Court Judge Ding Lasan yesterday ruled that Philippine Department of Finance Order No. 32, "All public market stalls shall be removed from stallholder leaseholds and stopped from January 1 of this year," was invalid. However, he stated that Philippine Republic Statute No. 37, which gives Filipinos priority in leasing public market stalls, is constitutional. The court temporarily issued an order targeting the Philippine Minister of Finance, the Manila Director of Finance, members of the Market Committee, and Manila market owners, prohibiting the execution of Department of Finance Order No. 32. The court stated: Judging from the wording of Republic Statute No. 37, the so-called Filipinization of market stalls is clearly not intended to give the provision retroactive effect to include stalls that have already been leased when the statute comes into effect, but only refers to stalls that have not yet been leased. This ruling can be appealed to the Supreme Court, which has the final decision on this issue.</p>

<h3>Inspection Team Decides in Kaifeng Meeting on Yellow River Flood Area Re-cultivation Plan: CNRRA Allocates 5 Billion Yuan to Purchase Urgently Needed Supplies</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] All members of the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team, jointly formed by CNRRA, UNRRA, and other units, have returned to Shanghai one after another. Based on the on-site observations, the team held a meeting in Kaifeng on the 16th to decide on a re-cultivation plan for the flood area and then began to actively promote it.</p>
<p>During the meeting in Kaifeng, the team focused on discussing: (1) relief for refugees, (2) distribution of agricultural tools and seeds, and (3) transportation. However, political issues were also involved. The American representative, the Canadian representative, and the Australian representative of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee all agreed that if the military problems in Henan Province are not resolved, the re-cultivation plan will be seriously affected and will fail.</p>
<p>The CCP Should Guarantee Non-Interference in Relief Efforts</p>
<p>American representative Gilchrist believes that UNRRA must hold consultations with the highest authorities of the CCP to obtain a guarantee from the CCP that they will not interfere with relief efforts.</p>
<p>The discussion on military issues coincided with two days after the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team's visit to Fugou County. The Fugou County CNRRA work team headquarters was attacked by CCP troops, and relief supplies were lost, which were witnessed by the inspection team. In addition to the private losses of Chinese and foreign staff, the work team lost 82 cattle, 362 bags of flour, and 2 million yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Currently, the refugees returning to their hometowns in the flood area have nothing and cannot carry out cultivation. Director Huo telegraphed CNRRA when he was in Henan to immediately remit 5 billion yuan in national currency to purchase seeds, agricultural tools, and other urgently needed supplies for distribution to the flood area.</p>
<p>Sun Dehe, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Mining Affairs Committee, reported on transportation issues, stating that 550 trucks will soon be allocated to the flood area to accelerate the transportation of relief supplies. However, 900 kilometers of highways that have been destroyed and damaged in Henan Province must be repaired first. The highway repair work relief project and the re-cultivation or re-embankment work relief project are currently being planned and implemented.</p>
<p>Afforestation and Dredging Plans Have Been Drafted</p>
<p>Mr. Brig, Deputy Director of the UNRRA Post-War Agricultural Committee, and Mr. Field, Deputy Director of the UNRRA Supply Group, believe that wind erosion and silting are as harmful as river floods. Therefore, it is recommended to plant more willow trees, depending on the wind direction, for protection, and to formulate long-term afforestation and dredging plans and earnestly advocate their implementation.</p>
<p>Water conservancy experts presented the opinion at the meeting that preventing future floods is as important as re-cultivating the flood area. Therefore, the Huaihe River re-embankment project in Anhui Province is necessary. Dredging the canal is a good deed, but the dredging project is expensive and cannot be completed quickly. Therefore, the Huaihe embankment must be strengthened to protect the lowlands on the south bank of the Huaihe River. According to the three-year plan drafted by the technical experts of UNRRA and CNRRA, 2,500,000 acres of land in the flood areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces should be re-cultivated. Currently, 2,000 refugees who are stranded in other provinces return to their hometowns in the flood area of Henan Province every day. The staff of the Henan Branch of CNRRA are working hard to carry out emergency relief work.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team rushed to Bengbu to inspect the Huaihe embankment in the area. At that time, 68,000 workers were engaged in embankment construction. The total length of the Huaihe embankment on both sides that needs to be repaired is 1,084 kilometers, requiring 36 million cubic meters of earthwork.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei, 21st] This place attaches great importance to the incident of the Wuhu police officers destroying the County Council and three newspaper offices. The reporter visited Mr. Huang Tongchou, the Director of Civil Affairs, who is in charge of police administration throughout the province, on the morning of the 21st. He said that he had not fully understood the inside story and process of the matter, but it was reported that the reason was that the local finances were difficult, the police officers' living standards were low, and there were arrears, which led to disobedience and gathering to destroy the County Council, and then destroying the Gongshang, Fuxing, and Dajiang newspaper offices.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Trends in the Japanese General Election</h3>
<p>April is Japan's political month: the so-called April election includes four types of elections: local governors, members of the House of Councillors, members of the House of Representatives, and local council members, which must be completed within April. The local governor elections, including 45 prefectural governors and 190 mayors across Japan, began voting on April 5 and have now been completed. Following the local governor elections, the new parliament elections will be held from April 20 to 25. The procedure is: the election of members of the House of Councillors, totaling 250, will begin on the 20th; the election of members of the House of Representatives, totaling 466, will begin on the 25th. After the central parliament elections, local council member elections will be held in various places on the 30th. The central and local parliaments will be established after the elections, and according to Article 67 of the new constitution, the Prime Minister must be elected by the parliament. Therefore, Japan's April general election will not only determine the fate of the Yoshida Cabinet but also be a "major test" for the future of Japanese politics.</p>
<p>Elections are a pointer of political trends, a test of the rise and fall of political parties, and a measure of public opinion. The results of the local governor elections that began on April 5 have already been determined: independents won 32 prefectural governor seats and 153 mayor seats; the Democratic Party won 3 prefectural governor seats and 20 mayor seats; the Liberal Party won 4 prefectural governor seats and 19 mayor seats; the Social Democratic Party won 3 prefectural governor seats and 9 mayor seats; the Communist Party won none; and other small parties won 3 prefectural governor seats and 8 mayor seats. The so-called independents are full of conservative colors; the Democratic Party is a transformation of the Progressive Party and, together with the Liberal Party, is a mainstay of conservative forces; the Socialist Party is a left-wing party and, together with the Communist Party, is a party of opposition; the small parties have indistinct colors and no great political power. In the local governor elections, the divided and concerted attacks of conservative forces symbolize the Japanese people's disappointment with democracy, but this is a favorable factor for the conservative forces' campaigns. The local governor elections can be said to be the prelude to the central parliament elections, and its trend is very clear and may also reflect the results of the parliament elections. According to Tokyo broadcasts, more than 38.35 million voters have now begun voting, and the order is very peaceful; looking at the trend, the conservative forces can win at least 171 seats in the 250-member House of Councillors, the Socialist Party may make progress, but cannot gain a dominant position, and the Communist Party is the upper house under the new constitution, the old constitution's House of Peers. The former members of the House of Peers were a feudal group composed of the imperial family, nobles, imperial appointees, and the majority of taxpayers, which was dissolved on March 31. The first direct election of members of the House of Councillors by the people. Although the feudal group of the imperial family has receded, what has risen in its place is the conservative force, which goes without saying that the election of members of the House of Representatives on the 25th may also have the same trend.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above analysis, we can point out the trends in Japanese politics and the direction of public opinion. First, this April election in Japan is based on MacArthur's instructions. On February 7, MacArthur sent a 'Election Recommendation' to Prime Minister Yoshida, advising him to hold a nationwide general election after the 93rd session of parliament closes to coincide with the implementation of the new constitution. The Japanese government accepted the directive, decided on the dates of the four elections on February 17, and dissolved parliament on March 31. The US Eighth Army dispatched district instructions on April 5 to monitor the progress of the elections, so it can be said that this election was conducted under MacArthur's guidance. Second, the new Japanese constitution is a progressive constitution. According to the new constitution, the Diet consists of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, and is the sole legislative body of the state, as well as the highest organ of state power. Matters previously decided by government orders will henceforth be decided by law. Therefore, the power of the Diet members is very great, they can determine the fate of the government, and they can determine the direction of politics. The victory of the conservative forces is the requirement of Japanese public opinion and national conditions, and the decline of the left-wing forces is also the decision of Japanese public opinion and national conditions, because the Japanese nation likes conservative democracy. Their political hopes and economic demands are gradual reforms, not a social revolution-style sudden change. Today's Japan will collapse with sudden changes, but it will survive with conservatism. Therefore, the conservative forces have a sure bet for victory in this general election. Third, the method of this election and the huge amount of election expenses have promoted the rise of independents and the Democratic and Liberal Parties. This election divides the large electoral districts into small electoral districts and uses direct voting to conduct four types of elections. Conservative forces represent landlords, capitalists, and bureaucrats, they have an advantage in the regions, and the elections will inevitably belong to them. Not only do they have a wide range of territories, but they can also pay election expenses of hundreds of millions of yen or more to carry out various necessary activities. The Communist Party's election expenses are tens of millions of yen, far beyond reach, and its inevitable defeat is not difficult to predict. Japanese people speculate that the price of being elected as a member of parliament is 500,000 yen. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party are unable to pay such large election expenses and are therefore unable to obtain more members of parliament. Politics follows economics, and economics is dragging the left-wing forces down and into a bleak future. The victory of the conservative forces and the victory of the ruling party are inevitable trends.</p>
<p>We are concerned about Japanese politics. The Potsdam Declaration stipulates that a 'government representing the will of the Japanese people' can promote Japan's progress. We hope that Japanese politics will progress, society will be stable, public opinion will be expressed, and that it will fulfill its obligations to the Allied countries during the process before and after the signing of the peace treaty. The establishment of a new government is promising. We hope that Japan will from now on embark on the road of democracy and earnestly implement the spirit of the new constitution.</p>

<h3>A Glimmer of Hope in the Discussion of the Austrian Peace Treaty Foreign Ministers Expedite Work Whether the Difficulties Can Be Overcome Will Be Known Soon A Heated Debate Occurred Yesterday Morning During the Discussion of the Trieste Port Report</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcast: The Foreign Ministers' Conference has entered its seventh week today, and no decisions have been made on major issues such as the country and the Austrian issue. The US believes that if the Soviet Union can make some concessions, the US will also make concessions. Also, the Foreign Ministers' Conference is expediting work as the closing is approaching.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcast: When the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers met today to discuss the report of the Trieste Port Finance Committee, Marshall, Bevin, and Bidault advocated submitting the report to the United Nations for research, but Molotov firmly opposed it. As a result, the Four Foreign Ministers unanimously agreed to submit it to the Vice Foreign Ministers of the Four Countries for research. At the same time, a heated debate arose over when the Vice Foreign Ministers should submit the report, because this matter is directly related to when the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers will be extended. Finally, the deadline issue was decided by the Vice Foreign Ministers of the Four Countries themselves.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Moscow, 21st Broadcast: Molotov said that the United States' permission to provide economic assistance to Trieste is actually "external interference" in Trieste affairs.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 20th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will conduct a preliminary study of the Austrian peace treaty plan this morning, which has been completed. Whether this peace treaty can be signed in Moscow by the Four Powers will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] The Four Foreign Ministers made good progress in discussing the Austrian treaty today. They have completed the review of the entire treaty and are engaged in a second review of the first half of the treaty to clarify some minor points that have not yet been agreed upon. The Foreign Ministers were originally scheduled to meet again in the afternoon, but it was temporarily canceled and replaced by a meeting of the Foreign Ministers' representatives this afternoon and tomorrow morning to review the provisions submitted by the Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Ministers will also continue to review the second half of the Austrian treaty tomorrow and discuss the report of the Trieste Finance Committee. The atmosphere at today's Foreign Ministers' Conference was sincere, and agreements were reached on some minor unresolved issues. Of the articles originally scheduled for discussion today, eight have been finally resolved, eleven are left to the Foreign Ministers or their representatives for continued review, and nine have not yet been resolved. Observers believe that if major issues such as borders, compensation, and German assets can be resolved, the final draft of the Austrian treaty is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time. The eight articles that have been finally resolved today are: (1) The introductory chapter of the Austrian treaty, the British suggestion to confirm Austria's responsibility in the war in this chapter has been adopted; (2) Naturalization and residence of Germans in Austria; (3) Transfer of war criminals; (4) Prohibition of former Nazis and other illegal organizations from serving in the Austrian army; (5) Restrictions on border defense facilities; (6) Establishment of a special organization to resolve disputes arising from the return of UN property in Austria; (7) Transit facilitation of certain Austrian railway lines; (8) The organization that approves the Austrian treaty. Since today's meeting has clarified the minor unresolved points, the discussions at tomorrow's meeting can focus on the major points.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Stalin Meet Again May Be Possible</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 20th] Regarding Marshal Stalin and US Secretary of State Marshall holding talks, the diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times recently wrote an article commenting that: This meeting did not create any developments that would make the US and the Soviet Union hope to gradually reach an understanding, but it is still possible for Stalin and Marshall to hold another, more effective meeting. It would be unwise to say that the Soviet government is unlikely to take last-minute action to prevent the Foreign Ministers' Conference from breaking down. However, considering the general state of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, it is still pessimistic on the whole. Regarding the increase in coal allocation from the Ruhr and Saar regions to the member states of the European Coal Committee, an agreement has been reached. This agreement can be said to represent a major effort by British Foreign Minister Bevin to satisfy the continuous demands of French Foreign Minister Bidault. The agreement is based on the main principle insisted upon by the French delegation, that is, the percentage of each ton of coal produced in Germany that is exported abroad should be clearly stipulated and should not only be what remains after Germany's own needs are met. The previous method made it possible for German miners to be unwilling to increase production.</p>
<h3>Bidault Visits Marshall</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 20th] French Foreign Minister Bidault visited US Secretary of State Marshal Marshall at the US Embassy in the Soviet Union today to discuss matters, but it was a private visit.</p>
<h3>If the German Problem Is Not Resolved, the US Will Implement a New Plan</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 21st] The conservative "Daily Mail" New York correspondent said today that US Secretary of State Marshall firmly believes that efforts by the Four Powers to reach an agreement on the German problem have been in vain. Once Marshall returns to the country from Moscow, he will immediately devote himself to promoting the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany. People in New York believe that France agrees to this plan. The US State Department is making final preparations for a plan based on President Truman's new plan to prevent communism. The case will soon be submitted to Congress requesting the appropriation of billions of dollars to democratic countries and requesting the cessation of financial and economic aid to the Soviet Union and its vassal states.</p>
<h3>4,000 German POWs Return from Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 20th] The Leipzig Radio Station recently issued a message stating that 4,000 German prisoners of war returned to Frankfurt, Germany from the Soviet Union today.

<h3>Next Foreign Ministers' Conference Marshall Suggests Holding It in October</h3>

<h3>The US Aid Plan for Greece and Turkey Is Expected to Pass the Senate by a Majority</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Although some people have asked the government to clarify its policy toward the Soviet Union during the Senate's discussion of Truman's bill to aid Greece and Turkey, it is expected to be passed by a vote of four to one when it is put to a vote on Tuesday, and it is believed that the dispute over the lease of materials to the Soviet Union is not enough to affect the final vote.</p>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister Speaks Defends the Government</p>
<p>[United Press, Thessaloniki, Greece, 20th] Foreign Minister Tsaldaris delivered a speech here today, arguing that US aid can ensure that communism is overcome within Greece. Tsaldaris said: The leaders of the Allied countries and international public opinion now recognize that the nature of the Greek people's struggle is passive. We have now obtained strong assistance, which guarantees the smooth outcome of the struggle. The success of various policies since Greece restored the monarchy in March of this year is evidenced by the following five things (1) Former British Prime Minister Churchill recently announced that Marshal Stalin had requested Thessaloniki or Alexandroupolis as a Soviet base during the Potsdam Conference; (2) The US State Department recognized that the lack of security hindered Greece's recovery and the establishment of the UN Security Council's Balkan Investigation Committee; (3) President Truman's speech on March 19 strongly stated that Greece was threatened by totalitarianism; (4) The Balkan Investigation Committee proved that Greece's neighbors intended to occupy the two provinces of Macedonia and Serres; (5) The Security Council decided to station observers in the northern border area of Greece.</p>
<h3>Britain Is Willing to Cooperate with the Soviet Union in Political and Economic Aspects and Plans to Borrow Money from the US Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew said at a Labor Party meeting that Britain is willing to obtain the closest cooperation with the Soviet Union in political and economic aspects. Although the Soviet Union criticizes our country, we must still be patient in order to establish a closer relationship between the two countries. Mayhew said that Britain's foreign policy has the goals of internationalism, anti-imperialism, democracy, and socialism.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Blackbourne, a powerful member of the Labor Party, said at a public meeting convened by the Labor Party today that Britain has no other way to go except to borrow money from the United States again in the next two years. He said, "We must not let the United States become isolationist. The United States must generously lend money so that people can have food and machines, so that Europe can be regenerated." Blackbourne praised Foreign Minister Bevan, saying that his foreign policy is the main factor that allows the United States to generously lend money to Britain.</p>
<h3>Britain, the United States, and France Complete Negotiations on the Ruhr Coal Issue</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 20th] Regarding the negotiations conducted by experts from Britain, the United States, and France on the Ruhr coal issue, it is learned that these negotiations have been largely completed, and what they discussed was a three-nation agreement to control the export of German coal within the scope of the European Coal Committee. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France will issue a joint communique simultaneously in London, Washington, and Paris tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Truman Delivers a Speech at the Annual Meeting of the Associated Press Striving to Maintain US Prosperity to Help the World</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 21st] President Truman attended the luncheon of the annual meeting of the Associated Press here today and delivered a speech, saying that the United States should improve the living standards of its people so that it can show other countries the vitality and advantages of a free economy. The United States should reduce prices domestically to strengthen the national economy, maintain prosperity, and then help the countries of the world that have suffered from war. The President also said: The freedom and integrity of the United States can only be safe in a world where free people live together in peace and trade freely with each other. This is why we want to help the free people of the world to maintain their freedom. He said that many people must choose between totalitarianism and democracy. These people have been devastated by war for a long time and have been reduced to poverty. They eat whatever they can find and are easily invaded by external forces and foreign ideas, so they are really in a difficult situation. These forces directly threaten their way of life and indirectly affect our own well-being. Only by providing economic assistance to various countries for post-war reconstruction can this madness be curbed. However, if we want to help others, we must always maintain our own prosperity. It is a well-known fact that our private industry and commerce system has improved the living standards of our people to the highest level in the world. If the living standards in our country can continue to improve, it will be enough to prove to the world that the free economy is indeed full of vitality and is indeed superior to other economies. This private industry and commerce system is now being tested before the world. If it can prove that it can produce more and is more stable, then it can be said to have passed the test. Conversely, if we ignore the various needs of our country's economy and shirk our responsibilities, we will not only lose the ability to help others, but we will also be unable to move others.</p>
<h3>French President's Tour of West Africa: Ramadier Emphatically Defends the Republic</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] French President Auriol, aboard the battleship "Richelieu," observing West Africa, arrived in Dakar today. Upon disembarking, he stated that his trip was intended to demonstrate that his duties and powers extend to all overseas territories.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Toulon, France, 20th] French Premier Ramadier, touring this area, delivered a speech today, forcefully asserting that France could no longer exist if it ceased to be a republic.

We have a constitution that guides our path, and step by step, the republic is being established. Experience tells us that this republic suits our temperament, he said.</p>
<h3>Churchill Refutes Wallace's Speech: "I Do Not Believe I Ever Called Wallace a Communist"</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 20th] Churchill today issued a strongly worded statement refuting the speech given by former U.S. Vice President Wallace in Washington on the 19th. Wallace had claimed that Churchill dared not publicly acknowledge that his party members believed another major war was inevitable. Churchill stated, "I do not believe that another major war is inevitable. However, if the United Kingdom and the United States adopt blind policies of appeasement and unilateral disarmament, then I deeply believe that another major war is indeed unavoidable." Churchill refuted that he had ever referred to Wallace as a "secret communist." He said, "I did not refer to Mr. Wallace as a secret communist. This was an error by the BBC. The corporation immediately corrected their error when it was pointed out."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, Denmark, 20th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace arrived here at 6:45 p.m. today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Oslo, Norway, 20th] Wallace, speaking at a public gathering of 2,000 Norwegians today, stated: There is a serious crisis, and the United Nations may become a bloc of certain countries against the Soviet Union. If I thought that criticizing the United States could produce peace, then I would criticize the United States.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Alliance Treaty: Includes Secret Clauses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st] "The Sunday Times" reported today that the Anglo-French alliance treaty includes several secret clauses. The French government's recent decision to prohibit illegal Jewish immigrants from entering Palestine via France is a result of these secret clauses. The report stated: The competition in the Middle East has always been the crux of Anglo-French colonial policies, and there is now good reason to believe that this attitude has changed. The UK's sale of various equipment to France two weeks ago, completing the equipment of the French airborne forces, further reinforces the belief that this is another gesture of British sympathy towards France's protection of its colonies.</p>
<h3>Danish King Passes Away: New Monarch Frederick Ascends the Throne Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 20th] King Christian of Denmark passed away at 11:04 PM tonight at the age of 76, having reigned for 33 years. Originally, the King was quite robust, but after falling from his horse in October 1942 and sustaining injuries, one leg was amputated. His injuries never fully healed, and he had a large wound on his leg. He then contracted pneumonia, and his health deteriorated. His condition became critical several times. During the last World War, his illness worsened, and Crown Prince Frederick became regent. The sad news spread tonight, and the Danish people mourned deeply, gathering in front of the royal palace until late at night before gradually dispersing. Churches throughout the capital tolled bells in mourning. The Danish cabinet will hold a meeting tomorrow to draft a document. Then, Prime Minister Christensen will announce the King's death on the parliament balcony, followed by "The King is dead, long live the King!" Then introduce the new King Frederick to the public.

<h3>International Security Force: Cannot Act Against the Five Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Success River, 20th] It is reported that the army and naval generals of the Five Powers attending the United Nations Military Staff Committee have agreed that the mission of the proposed International Security Force should be limited to resolving disputes between small and medium-sized countries. It is said that the representatives believe that the UN forces cannot take action against one of the Five Powers for two reasons: (1) any of the Five Powers can use its veto power on resolutions passed by the Security Council against itself; (2) when any of the Five Powers or a coalition of the Five Powers takes aggressive action against other major powers, a state of war will exist.</p>

<h3>Tensions Rise in the Holy Land: Terrorist Incidents Occur Repeatedly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 21st] Bombs were reportedly thrown at five British army camps today. Power along 300 miles of the Palestinian coastline was also reportedly cut off at eight locations. It is widely believed that these actions are part of a full-scale uprising by the Jewish underground army, aimed at drawing the United Nations' attention to the Holy Land issue. A British army spokesman has confirmed this news, saying that six British soldiers were injured when a bomb was thrown in Natanya, the diamond center between Tel Aviv and Haifa. An army communiqué also stated that a British army camp near H伏脫, eight miles south of Tel Aviv, was bombed, but details were not given. Information on bombings and attacks on British army units in areas north of Tel Aviv, such as H地拉, White他, 鐵克伐, and 賴那那, could not be obtained. Another unconfirmed report stated that a major fire had broken out near H地拉, and all civilian vehicle transportation had been ordered to stop driving on the central highway to clear the way for military police to go to the aid of the H地拉 area. The police department announced today that an explosive device in a truck had been uncovered in the Natanya area. News from Jerusalem stated that the entire coast of Palestine may be under concentrated attack by the Jewish underground army and the Stern Gang, all under the command of the same leader. Telephone lines between Tel Aviv and H地拉 have been cut, and that area appears to be the center of the attacks. It is also reported that Began, the leader of the Jewish underground army, has been appointed commander of the joint attacks by the Jewish underground army and the Stern Gang.</p>

<h3>Nazi War Criminals: No Burial Place; Bodies Cremated and Ashes Thrown into River</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Munich, 20th] Reliable sources say that the bodies of the ten Nazi war criminals executed last October, as well as Goering's body, were cremated, placed in military garbage cans, and dumped into the Isar River near here by four Allied generals. The four generals, representing the British, American, French, and Soviet occupation powers, personally threw the ash cans into the river on a frigid morning before dawn, forbidding any assistants or adjutants from being present in order to keep the location of the dumping secret.</p>
<p>After the criminals were hanged in Nuremberg Prison, two military trucks placed twelve unpainted wooden boxes, eleven containing bodies and one empty (to create confusion) into the prison courtyard on the morning of October 16th. The drivers were ordered to drive quickly but to avoid accidents that would delay their mission. They were accompanied by several jeeps carrying fully armed American soldiers, and the four generals. The convoy raced through the streets of Nuremberg, weaving to avoid being followed. Outside the city, the convoy took a specially closed highway straight to Munich, where the wooden boxes were stacked three high and placed in the crematorium.</p>
<p>All German workers at the crematorium were transferred elsewhere. At the request of the British and Soviet generals, Goering's and Jodl's coffins were opened for a final inspection. After an American officer opened the coffins, the Soviet general inspected both coffins and pinched Goering's cheek to verify that he was indeed dead. After the inspection, the coffins were nailed shut, and two American Graves Registration officers were called into the room to begin the cremation process. Crematorium staff were told that the bodies of fallen American soldiers were being cremated, but the secrecy of the operation made it easy for them to guess who was lying in the coffins.</p>
<p>The four generals left after the cremation of Goering's and Jodl's coffins and an American officer supervised the cremation of the remaining coffins. Shortly before midnight, the four generals returned, by which time all the bodies had been cremated to ashes. One general suggested that it would be easier to put the ashes of the dead into one container. The ashes of eleven people were put into a military trash can, which was placed in the back seat of an ordinary German black car and driven straight to the Isar River in Munich and thrown into the rushing river. This was the last journey of Hitler's cronies. Afterward, an American officer found eleven small metal tanks in the crematorium, but none of them contained ashes, probably another diversion.</p>

<h3>Retrial of Embezzlement Case at the Materials Department of the Railway Bureau: Witnesses and Defendants Confront Each Other in Court; Zhang Hongtu Denies That Zhang Bokang Was His Confidant; One Session Concluded, Verdict Scheduled for the 25th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The embezzlement case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration was retried by the High Court. The defendants, Zhang Hongtu, Zhu Biwen, Chen Jingyao, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Xia Dingwu, Xu Chuangui, Sun Xuesan, Li Jie, Cai Zhidao, He Zuen, and the twelve people were sent back to the District Court for a retrial. Yesterday, the trial was opened, presided over by Judge Xie Zhiying of the Eighth Criminal Court. Cao Zuxin, Li Fenbin, Wu Lianqing, Xia Zhaozhen, Yu Kanghou, Shen Liansheng, Zhou Jinhua, Xu Binghong, and Chen Bochuang, the director of the Railway Administration, representing the judicial section chief of the police department, Cai Dingbang, were summoned, as were witnesses Yu Xiangyan, Zhang Bokang, Wang Renmao, Jing Weijun, Gu Zhenmin, Yu Peien, and Li Runsheng to confront the defendants. The trial began at 10:00 AM and ended at 4:00 PM. One session of debate has concluded, and the verdict is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 25th of this month. The defendants who were detained were returned to custody, and those who were released on bail remained on their original bail.</p>
<p>The Director Heads to Beijing, the Section Chief Represents</p>
<p>After Judge Xie called the roll, he first summoned Cai Dingbang, the section chief representing Director Chen, and asked why Chen Bochuang was absent. According to Cai, Director Chen had been ordered to report to Beijing on the affairs of the bureau, so he delegated Cai to represent him. Next, Zhang Bokang (chief of the purchasing section), who had been called as a witness, testified that he and Zhang Hongtu were old colleagues, and that he did not know Yu Xiangyan at all. Later, he became familiar with her because they were neighbors. As for giving Zhang Hongtu one million yuan in mid-December 1945, Zhang Bokang evaded and refused to speak directly. Judge Xie turned to Zhang Hongtu and asked why he sometimes approved and sometimes disapproved of the purchase of materials. Zhang replied that he rarely disapproved, only about two or three percent of the time. He also said that Zhang Bokang was slandering him with corruption only to reduce his own guilt. He said that on May 29, after discovering leaflets attacking the Materials Department at the North Station, he had ordered Zhang Bokang to be careful and restrain himself to avoid giving people something to talk about.</p>
<p>The Price Review Committee Was Not Approved for Establishment</p>
<p>He also stated that he had submitted a request to Director Chen twice, suggesting the establishment of a Materials Price Review Committee to evaluate the price of materials, but both times he was rejected by the director. As for the reasons for Director Chen's rejection, he did not know. Section Chief Cai Dingbang immediately explained that Director Chen believed that market prices changed at any time, and that it would not be effective for non-specialized personnel who were unfamiliar with market conditions to handle the matter together. Moreover, employees of the Materials Department who participated in the purchase would easily create corruption, so he did not approve it. Zhang Hongtu also said that he had submitted a request to the director to replace Zhang Bokang, but it was returned by Director Chen and not approved. Section Chief Cai also replied on behalf of Director Chen that the bureau had received a secret report when he submitted the request. He also presented Director Chen's letter in court, stating that Zhang Bokang was Zhang Hongtu's confidant, and that their relationship was extremely deep, pointing to collusion and corruption. After hearing the contents of the letter, Zhang Hongtu also rebutted in court, saying that although Zhang Bokang was introduced to the bureau by him, one introduction did not mean that he was a "confidant". If Director Chen introduced more private individuals into the bureau, would they all be "confidants"? A price list that had been altered was presented in court, and Zhang Hongtu was questioned. Zhang replied that the director of the two departments only approved the material comparison table, and that the price list was submitted by the merchant, so he could ask the merchant.</p>
<p>The Wife's Affairs Are Not Necessarily Known</p>
<p>The court then asked why he knew nothing about what Yu Xiangyan had done. Zhang replied that under the current marital system, a husband does not necessarily know what his wife does, and there is no reason for him to know. Zhang Honggang also stated that the ministry's order of December 10, 1945, had intended to transfer Zhang Bokang, but it was blocked by Chen Bochuang, so it was inappropriate for Chen Bochuang to refer to Zhang Bokang as his personal secretary. After questioning Zhang Honggang, the remaining eleven defendants were questioned. Their statements were consistent with the fact that they did not know the circumstances of the corruption, and they all believed that the money they received was a reward, three times in total. The first time was at the end of the solar year, the second time was at the end of the lunar year, and the third time was during the Dragon Boat Festival. Jing Weijun directly admitted that all the money he received was handled by him alone, but he claimed that the merchant sent it automatically and did not force him. However, the merchant who testified in court stated that Jing Weijun borrowed it. The defendant's defense lawyers made brief defenses because the trial had taken too long.</p>

<h3>Tang Shoumin's Trial Concludes: The Cases of Traitors Tao Li and Lu Boyun Are Also Concluded on the Same Day, and the Verdicts Are Scheduled for the 28th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Tang Shoumin, the former general manager of the Bank of Communications, was accused of serving as the chairman of the Puppet Commerce and Trade Association during the enemy puppet period, buying more than 127,000 pieces of gauze for the enemy, and serving as a counselor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and a member of the Puppet National Economic Commission. The High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment on May 30 of last year. The defendant was dissatisfied and applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The High Court has opened several hearings for investigation. The case was debated in the High Court yesterday morning. The trial concluded, and the verdict is scheduled for the morning of the 28th. Tao Zhongli was accused of organizing the Dazhong Shipping Company, the Dongfang Shenqu Opera House, and the Jichang Cotton Company during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. He was very close to the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie, Takeshita Mu, and translators Zheng Jinwen, Wang Bin, etc. On October 5, 1942, he colluded with the enemy soldier Tanaka to lure Weng Maozhao, the executive member of the 20th district branch of the Nanhui County Party Department, to the Japanese gendarmerie headquarters at Wangjia Wharf in the city, forcing Weng to admit that he had contact with anti-Japanese elements Yang Baolin and hid more than 30 guns. Subsequently, Weng was sentenced to five months in prison, and he suffered severe torture. After Weng's sentence expired, Tao extorted 10,000 puppet currency. In May 1945, the enemy arrested merchants Gong Deming and Fan Jinkun, saying that they knew Wang Zixiang of the Zhongjiu Army. As a result, more than ten cans of British tin-packaged cigarettes and 50,000 puppet currency were extorted. Fan was extorted 1 million puppet currency. All of these were delivered to Takeshita through Tao and shared more than 200,000 yuan. The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday and is scheduled to be sentenced on the 28th. Lu Boyun, a detective of the Puppet Qingpu County Police Bureau, who was accused of being a traitor, is also scheduled to be sentenced on the 28th.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Food Supplies Allocated for Public Works: Unable to Supply Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] With the Shanghai branch of UNRRA nearing its end, the relief supplies for charitable organizations that maintain foster homes in the city will be discontinued. This will have a significant impact on poverty relief. The Shanghai Social Relief Association, in view of this, had Changwu Directors Du Yuesheng, Huang Hanzhi, and others jointly send a telegram to UNRRA Director Huo, requesting that the supply of major food items to various relief agencies be maintained until the end of December after the Shanghai branch of UNRRA was closed, but it was rejected. According to the reply telegram from the UNRRA, the total amount of food supplies scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai in the future will be no more than 20,000 tons, and it has been approved for allocation to the Water Conservancy Commission for projects. Therefore, the relief agency has no more food to allocate for the supply of major food items until the end of this year, and it is difficult to comply.</p>
<h3>Four Employees of the World Book Company Printing Factory Accused of Being Traitors: Re-examined Yesterday; Still Accusing Each Other</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of four employees of the World Book Company Dalianwan Road Printing Factory mutually accusing each other of being traitors was re-examined in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Xue Juemin, who was recorded, was the accountant of the World Book Company investment group stationed at the factory. During the War of Resistance, the World Book Company Dalianwan Road Printing Factory was occupied by the enemy and converted into the Huazhong Printing Company. On August 1, 1943, Xue and Zhou Xiangyun, an employee of the factory who was fluent in Japanese, negotiated with the Japanese Embassy. The printing factory was taken back. After receiving it, Xue became the director of the factory, and Shen Lianfang, the original person in charge of the factory, became the deputy director.</p>
<p>Zhou also served in an important position, jointly handling the business in the factory. They successively printed puppet state textbooks, enemy army military textbooks, central party and government car organizational system charts, and puppet Huainan Bank notes, and donated money to the enemy and received awards. After the victory, Wang Furou, the chief of the factory's engineering section, reported them. Xue and others then counter-accused Wang Furou of colluding with the enemy puppets and stealing books from the World Book Company during the occupation. Because it was discovered, he harbored resentment and falsely accused them. The High Procuratorate prosecuted them together for being traitors. They still accused each other during yesterday's trial. Xue said that he was not the director, but Shen insisted that Xue was the director, and the deputy director never asked about the factory's major and minor matters. Zhou said that he did not speak Japanese. Chen Baoyi was another translator of the World Book Company. Afterwards, the witnesses, salesman Jin Yifei, worker Fei Yunfang, and driver Mao Baoyu, were summoned. Their testimonies were mostly favorable to Xue. Wang Furou said that the three witnesses colluded with Xue. Judge Qiu said that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered that the hearing be adjourned. The four defendants were still released on their original bail. Raise the minimum salary discount point</p>

<h3>Subsistence Allowance to Increase This Month, Hope for Mold-Free Rice in Next Ration, Thorough Investigation of Profiteering Through Purchase of Ration Coupons</h3>
<p>The amount of the in-kind subsistence allowance for civil servants and teachers in this city for April will be appropriately increased due to the recent sharp fluctuations in prices. The current price levels differ greatly from those in March, and the authorities are currently calculating the adjusted amount.</p>
<p>The rice distributed in the first in-kind ration was of poor quality, reddish in color, and had a moldy taste. After the Review Committee sent the rice to the General Food Warehouse for investigation, it is now known that the warehouse sent personnel to visit Ge Shixin, the Chief Secretary of the Review Committee of the Municipal Government, to explain the situation and stated that the quality of the rice in the next ration would be improved. It is also reported that a small number of rice shops are profiteering by purchasing in-kind ration coupons from civil servants and teachers. The price for each coupon is said to be 40,000 yuan per period for civil servants and 25,000 yuan for public servants. As for the ration of flour, because it is high-quality "Ship Brand" flour, it is also reported that a few flour shops are purchasing each coupon at a price of 42,000 yuan. The authorities are currently thoroughly investigating the above-mentioned illegal activities.</p>

<h3>New Business at Postal Remittance Bureau: Handling Package Mortgages</h3>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in order to facilitate merchants and residents, has specifically instructed its branches in various locations to handle package mortgage business. This can be done in all locations within the country where there are postal management bureaus or first-class post offices, and where there are also savings and remittance branches or offices. Merchants and residents who wish to apply for this type of mortgage can contact the local savings and remittance branch or office. In Hangzhou, the local branch of the Four Joint Offices has also proposed that various banks handle silk mortgage, limited to packages received and sent by the post office. It is reported that the proposal has been approved by the Council of Directors of the Four Joint Offices.</p>

<h3>Third Assembly Meeting Cannot Be Held as Scheduled</h3>

It has been learned that the Municipal Government's work in re-compiling the budget for the 36th year of the Republic, among other tasks, is extremely heavy and may not be completed in time.</p>
<h3>Foreign Car Dealers Prepare to Close After Import Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the government restricted automobile imports, the business of Chinese and foreign automobile dealers in this city has come to a standstill. It is reported that foreign companies, such as General Motors, are already laying off employees in preparation for closure. Ford, however, is still waiting, hoping that the government will change the regulations. According to people in the industry, the government once stipulated an import quota of 500 vehicles, but soon after completely canceled it. However, certain state agencies can still rely on special status to directly order and import cars from abroad, and many of these cars appear on the black market after import. Therefore, foreign companies are extremely dissatisfied.</p>
<h3>Electricity Supply Improves, Factories Can Obtain Power</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to those in charge of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the electricity supply situation in this city has been improving daily. Industrial electricity in the former International Settlement area and the western Shanghai area can now be supplied as much as possible. Recently, a large number of factories in the area have applied to the company, and they can all get what they want. Also, since daylight saving time has been implemented, the city's electricity consumption should be reduced considerably. However, because daylight saving time has only been in effect for a week, there are no accurate statistics on how much can be saved. Last weekend, due to the fact that industrial and residential electricity usage were not adjusted after the implementation of daylight saving time, there was a shortage of electricity and a partial power outage occurred. Previously, because of insufficient electricity in the city, the Electric Power Company had obtained the cooperation of various factories to rotate shutdowns for three hours every night during the peak residential electricity usage time, so that the electricity supply remained normal and prevented damage to machinery. After the new time was implemented, factories stopped and started work according to the new time, but residents, due to habit, mostly delayed their lights-out time by one hour according to the new time. For example, factories that originally started work at 10:00 pm old time now start work at 10:00 pm new time, but residents who originally went to bed at 10:00 pm old time often still delay until 11:00 pm new time. Therefore, during the period from 10:00 pm to 11:00 pm new time, residents are still using electricity, and factories have also started using electricity. With both sides demanding electricity at the same time, the electricity supply became insufficient again. The Shanghai Electric Power Company is now improving this situation and has obtained the agreement of various factories to cooperate by delaying the daily shutdown and startup time by one hour to avoid conflicting with residential electricity usage.</p>

<h3>Yuanpei and Qiujin to Sail Shanghai-Tianjin and Shanghai-Qingdao Routes, Respectively</h3>
<p>Haitian Wheel Postponed Until Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's China-India line's "Haitian" ship, on its second voyage to Calcutta, was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai today. However, the foreign ship anchored in the Chinese dock has not yet been removed as of yesterday, so it cannot be loaded. It is reported that the foreign ship is scheduled to be moved today, and the "Haitian" ship will move from the Qiujiang dock to the Chinese dock for loading today, and is scheduled to set sail for India tomorrow. In addition, in order to facilitate passengers on the Tianjin-Shanghai route, the company has renovated the "Dawei," "Dalun," and "Datong" ships and renamed them "Xi Lin," "Yuanpei," and "Qiujin." The "Xi Lin" ship has sailed on the Shanghai-Tianjin route many times, but because there are not many passenger seats, it is not enough for passengers. Therefore, the "Yuanpei" and "Qiujin" ships were renovated yesterday. The "Yuanpei" ship will sail on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, and the "Qiujin" ship will sail on the Shanghai-Qingdao route, with the maiden voyage scheduled for this weekend.</p>
<h3>Huangxing Ship Damaged in Huangpu River Due to Strong Winds and Waves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Huangxing" ship, loaded with more than 3,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and temporarily docked at buoys No. 5 and No. 6. It was originally scheduled to move to the Yangjiadu wharf at 4:00 pm to unload the coal. At around 3:00 pm, when it was about to set sail southward, the Danish ship "Deli Maersk," managed by Jebsen &amp; Co., arrived in Shanghai from the United States and was scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang wharf. When it sailed near buoys No. 5 and No. 6, due to strong winds and currents, the bow of the ship crashed directly into buoy No. 6, causing the hawser connecting the "Huangxing" ship to buoy No. 6 to break, and the bow rope connecting it to buoy No. 5 was also broken. The stern of the ship was also grazed by the bow of the "Deli Maersk," and the ship became unmoored at both ends. It drifted towards Puxi and approached the inner bank. At that time, there were many small boats and wharf barges moored on the inner bank. The captain was alert and immediately ordered the anchor to be dropped, thus fortunately preventing a disaster. The Danish ship was unable to dock due to the strong currents and temporarily docked at buoys No. 4 and No. 5. The stern of the "Huangxing" ship was slightly damaged. It was moved to the Yangjiadu wharf at 6:00 pm. The captain has reported to the head office and will negotiate with Jebsen &amp; Co. It is reported that buoy No. 6 was also damaged.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(Refusal to Vacate)</p>
<p>Wang Keqing asks: Yi rented a house from Jia for a period of one year. At the end of the term, Yi was supposed to move out, but it was difficult to find a house at the end of the term, and Yi was unable to move out, but Jia was anxious to take it back for his own use. After mutual litigation, the Housing Rental Management Committee mediated, and Yi agreed to vacate the house on December 22 of this year. The deadline has now passed, and Yi has not yet found a place to live. Please answer: (1) Is it illegal for Yi to refuse to vacate? (2) Can Jia request the authorities to enforce the eviction? (3) What kind of procedure should be used to request an extension of the lease term?</p>
<p>Lawyer Qin Liankui answers: (1) It is not a criminal act to fail to vacate in accordance with the mediation record. (2) Eviction may not be immediately possible. (3) If you want to extend the lease term, you should ask the owner for consent.</p>
<p>(2) Encroachment on Land</p>
<p>Shu Ming asks: Jia has nine points of land, which were pawned to Yi for 150 national currency before the War of Resistance Against Japan. It has not been redeemed to this day, and Jia has died three years ago. A land registration was held in the local area last month, and the land was encroached upon and registered by Bing, a member of Jia's clan, but the land deed is still with Yi. Bing's encroachment registration was handled according to the method of lost title deed. Please answer: (1) How should Jia's descendants apply for re-registration? (The registration period has passed) (2) How should they negotiate with Bing? (3) If they want to redeem the land deed from Yi, how much should they repay in principal and interest?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) Declare the facts and request re-registration. (2) Demand the withdrawal of the fraudulent registration. (3) The redemption amount is based on the pawn deed, but if the pawnee requests an increase in payment due to changed circumstances, it can only be fairly measured by the court unless otherwise agreed.</p>

<h3>National Students at All Levels: Number of Publicly Funded Students: Ministry of Education Stipulates New Ratios</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Based on the results of discussions regarding the publicly funded student system at last week's ministerial meeting, the Ministry of Education has decided on the following measures for publicly funded students in national schools this year. In addition to maintaining the original publicly funded system, new publicly funded students must apply during the application process. The school will then submit the applications to the ministry for approval according to the prescribed procedures. The new ratios for publicly funded students at all levels are as follows: (1) For full public funding at universities, university-level specialized courses, and middle schools, the maximum quota is 20% of the number of students admitted, with the same ratio for half public funding. (2) For five-year vocational schools and vocational schools, the maximum quota for full public funding is 30% of the number of students admitted, with the same ratio for half public funding. (3) For construction and training classes at the specialized or higher level, the quotas for full and half public funding are both set at 30% for five-year programs, and 20% for all other programs. For advanced science and technology classes at the secondary level, the quotas for full and half public funding are both set at 30%. The application procedures for public funding for students in the above classes are the same. (4) The remaining funds from the publicly funded portion of the construction and training class budget will be used for the equipment of that class.</p>
<h3>Encyclopaedia Britannica: Textbook Films Publicly Shown</h3>
<p>For Reference by Teachers of All Schools</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Textbook films, an audio-visual education tool, use entire moving diagrams to replace text in books. Subjects that are difficult to explain clearly with lengthy text can be clearly displayed in textbook films within a dozen minutes. They are easy for students to understand, easy for teachers to instruct, and save time and energy. Their teaching effectiveness far surpasses that of textbooks. The education circles in the UK and the US are making great efforts to promote these textbook films. For example, last summer in the US, more than 120 universities and specialized schools held summer sessions specifically to train teachers on how to use textbook films to promote audio-visual education. This clearly demonstrates their significant educational value. The import of these films into our country has recently become unrestricted, which is truly a boon for all students. How to seize the opportunity to meet the new trend of audio-visual education is a topic of great concern for the education community. It is reported that the China Film and Photographic Equipment Supply Company, located at Room 603, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road in this city, is now initiating free public screenings of Encyclopaedia Britannica textbook films, covering various topics such as astronomy, geography, physiology, hygiene, biology, botany, chemistry, and electricity, for reference by teachers of all schools. Written registration is now open to schedule dates and arrange invitations separately. When writing, please specify: (1) Name, (2) Title, (3) Type of textbook to be viewed, (4) Date and time of desired viewing, (5) School stamp, (6) Mailing address.</p>
<h3>City Council to Telegraph Executive Yuan Again: Requesting Allocation of Hongqiao Airfield</h3>
<p>Heard it will be used as a Secondary Education and Culture District</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The former site of Hongqiao Airfield was previously approved by the City Council to be used as a Shanghai Secondary Education and Culture District, and the municipal government submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for allocation. However, the Executive Yuan instructed that the airport would be used as an international airport and could not be approved. Yesterday, City Councilor Xu Zeti, together with Xie Engao, Director of the Secondary Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, visited Hongqiao Airport and believed that the site was most suitable for use as a secondary education and culture district. It is heard that the City Council will telegraph the Executive Yuan again to reconsider.</p>

<h3>Life of Male and Female Students at Peking University</h3>
<p>— He Jingyu</p>
<p>There are no boundaries between female and male students. In classrooms or libraries, they can treat each other as siblings.</p>
<p>Most of the female students at the Southwest Associated University were at Tsinghua, with very few at Peking University. However, among the few returning students at Peking University, there were quite a few returning Kunming young ladies. They still spoke the Yunnan dialect, "shi la me," to each other. Those who had been to Yunnan and had experienced eight years of air raid alerts felt a sense of longing and loss, as well as a kind of warmth. In the long days of Kunming, where spring is always in the air, how many people's hair had turned white? Even today, many professors' families remain in Kunming, where the climate is spring-like year-round, to recuperate, and the cost of living is particularly low, although it was once the most expensive city in the world and maintained the number one spot for a long time.</p>
<p>There Must be Phenomenon if China Advances</p>
<p>The number of female students is very large. The Medical School, the Agricultural School, and the Preparatory Class, which has four hundred students, are not located in Sand Beach. The Engineering School is newly established and only has first-year students who are still taking classes at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. But the most interesting thing is that there are already many female students studying electrical and mechanical engineering. At Kunming, the Engineering School only had one table of female students the first time. China has made progress. In the near future, there will definitely be more female engineers in China than there are female lawyers now. The optimistic President Hu believes that this is a necessary phenomenon for China's progress. Seeing the female students studying so hard today, perhaps on the day when the Constitution is truly implemented, our government may have a female Minister of Labor like the United States.</p>
<p>When it comes to female students, no one can forget the question of their beauty. Because most of them grew up in Beiping, 99 percent of them speak the Beijing dialect. Even those who have never been to Beiping naturally learn to speak "human language" (as Mr. Lao She wittily called it). They all speak fluent, smooth, clear, and elegant Beiping dialect, which certainly adds to their beauty. Although their clothes are not as sophisticated as those in Shanghai's Jiangwan or Datong Guanghua, besides their interest in clothes, they often run to the library or laboratory. Even after taking exams, they still occupy seats in the library, reading books that are not assigned by professors and newly arrived academic journals from the United States and Europe. Some take advantage of holidays to concentrate on writing dissertations and books. After all, the one or two percent who watch two movies and have a cheap meal at Dong'an Market are the very rare exception. Compared to Shanghai's glamorous world, where a cup of tea in a dance hall costs 20,000 yuan, the male and female students at Peking University and Tsinghua University only feel inferior, unable to catch up, and inevitably appear "poor and dull," admiring with awe. Half of their beautiful youth is spent on academics, one-half of the remaining half is spent on ordinary life, and the other half is spent on love. Perhaps this ratio is just right. Among the female students, many see themselves as elder sisters and devote their entire lives to academic work. "Everyone has their own aspirations," as the saying goes.</p>
<p>Debating Problems Becomes a Trend</p>
<p>Recently, male students have criticized female students, saying that the quality of Tsinghua's female students is better than that of Peking University's. "Quality" is a euphemism for beauty. The reason is that there were more beautiful women during the Southwest Associated University period, and Tsinghua had the most female students from the Southwest Associated University, so Tsinghua's "quality" is better than Peking University's. Others say that Peking University has a large quantity, and with a large quantity, the quality must also be excellent, or at least the probability of excellence is high. This is another kind of logic. The students of the two schools originally came from the same family, so the custom of visiting each other in the city and outside the city is very popular on Sundays, and male students naturally discuss this issue with each other. There are scholars at Peking University who are proficient in geomancy, like Liu Bowen, who believe that the gate of Tsinghua Park is well-positioned, while the various colleges of Peking University are separated and do not have a gate at all. Without a gate, how can the geomancy be good! This may be the saying of eclectic and yin-yang schools, which is certainly not the orthodox Confucian school. However, there are no boundaries between the female and male students of the two schools. In classrooms or libraries, they can treat each other as siblings, exploring knowledge, debating problems, and questioning each other, which has become a trend. The library facilities are among the richest in the country. It is a pity not to study the many good books available. Asking people to move will rarely result in a peaceful day. The country has hired so many great scholars, and we must live up to the country. This world is still ruled by scholars, but wars are completed by scientists.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Guangzhao and Other Middle Schools Request Loans from the Four Banks Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, more than 20 private schools in Shanghai, including Patriotic Girls' Middle School and Guangzhao Middle School, were severely damaged. These schools had requested the municipal government to forward their request to the Executive Yuan for permission to borrow 200 to 300 million yuan per school from national banks to rebuild new school buildings. The Executive Yuan's joint office of the four banks put forward a discussion and decided that each school could raise funds from educational institutions. It is reported that this official reply has arrived at the Municipal Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>International Students in the United States: China Has the Largest Number: A Total of 1,498 People</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] The Foreign Student Friendship Association and the Institute of International Education here, both private organizations, jointly compiled year-end statistics on foreign students in the United States, totaling 14,956 people, setting a new record for the association in more than 20 years. However, the report also stated that the accurate number may be even higher, as the association's statistical deadline was February 6, and some omissions are inevitable. Thirteen percent of the total, or 1,915 people, come from the Far East or Southwest Asia. Among them, Chinese students are the most numerous, totaling 1,498 people. The Philippines is next, with 295 people.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] Teachers College, Columbia University, now has students from outside the American continent, setting a new record. Of the total of 362 people, 168 are male and 194 are female. Among them, the largest numbers are from China, India, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii.</p>
<h3>Municipal School Academic Advancement Fees: Likely to be Distributed This Week</h3>
<p>The municipal government may allocate the academic advancement fees for municipal schools in this city to the Education Bureau for distribution within this week. It is reported that the National Education Department of the Education Bureau is currently compiling the amount of academic advancement fees collected by each school and the number of students in schools that have not collected the fees, so that they can be distributed immediately after the municipal government allocates the funds. When all academic advancement fees are distributed, schools that have already collected fees but have not reported them may not be allocated any funds, and the amount collected should be refunded to the students. As for those who have not collected academic advancement fees and have not reported to the Education Bureau, their right to allocation will also be cancelled. Therefore, any academic advancement fee survey forms that are not submitted to the Bureau before the 24th of this month will inevitably suffer an intangible loss.</p>
<h3>Private Schools Approved for Establishment: 30 Elementary and Middle Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau has recently been very crowded with applicants for the establishment of private schools and is processing the review procedures in batches. Recently, the fifth batch of private school establishment applications has been reviewed by the Review Committee and approved by the 65th Bureau Affairs Meeting, with a total of 30 private elementary and middle schools being approved for establishment. Establishment certificates and school bells will be issued soon. All other private schools that have not yet been approved for establishment must complete the establishment procedures in accordance with the law before the end of April. Failure to submit an application within the deadline will result in a suspension of enrollment during this summer vacation. The list of private schools that have been approved for establishment is divided as follows: (1) Private Middle Schools: Nianhua Girls' Junior High School, Ronghai, Datong Junior High School, Chuneng, Qilu, Shaoxing Luhai, Lizhi, Yangzheng, Zhizhong Girls' Middle School, Pudong Junior High School, and 10 other schools.

The Soviet Union does not yet have such a committee, but the Soviet Union has requested to participate in various international sports organizations. If it is approved, the Soviet Union can establish a National Olympic Committee. As for Germany and Japan, they have not been invited.

<h3>Provisional Rules for Round Table Tennis, Equipment and Setup</h3>
<p>In the realm of ball sports, table tennis stands out for its simplicity of equipment. Just a table, net, paddle, net stand, and ball are all you need to start a lively game. Similarly, the equipment and setup for round table tennis are not complicated.</p>
<p>(A) Round Table Tennis Table</p>
<p>The tabletop material is unrestricted, but must be smooth and resilient. The standard for resilience is that a standard ball dropped from a height of 30.5 cm above the tabletop should bounce back to an average height of 20.3 cm to 22.9 cm. The radius of the round tabletop is 1.3725 meters, and the height of the tabletop from the ground is 0.762 meters. The tabletop must be installed level. The entire surface of the tabletop and legs should be painted a non-reflective dark green. A white border line, 1.9 cm wide from the edge, should be painted around the circumference of the round tabletop. In three-person round table tennis, the round tabletop should be divided into three equal sectors, each sector with an arc length of 120 degrees and a central angle of 120 degrees. The three equal radii should also be painted with white lines 1.9 cm wide. In four-person round table tennis, the round tabletop is divided into four equal sectors, each sector with an arc length and a central angle of 90 degrees. The original three radii are replaced with two mutually perpendicular diameters.</p>
<p>(B) Table Tennis Round Pillars</p>
<p>The material of the round pillars is unrestricted. In three-person round table tennis, four round pillars are used, one placed in the center of the round tabletop, and the other three placed at equal distances around the circumference. The top of the pillar should extend 17.1 cm above the tabletop, and the pillar should be perpendicular to the tabletop. The cross-sectional diameter of the round pillar is 1.9 cm, and the base of the pillar cannot extend horizontally beyond the tabletop. In four-person round table tennis, there are a total of five pillars, one placed at the center, and the other four placed at the four equal points on the circumference. The height and thickness of the pillars are the same as in the three-person version.</p>
<p>(C) Table Tennis Net</p>
<p>In three-person games, there are three nets, each extending from the central table tennis pillar to the table tennis pillar on the circumference, dividing the round tabletop into three equal sections. In four-person games, there are four nets, arranged in the same manner as in three-person games, vertically dividing the round tabletop into four equal sections. The width of the net is 17.2 cm. The color of the net should be white, and the mesh size should be 1.9 cm square. A colored edge, 1.9 cm wide, should be sewn onto the top edge of the net. The two ends of the net should be tightly fastened to the top of the table tennis pillars so that the top edge of the net is level.</p>
<p>(D) Ball and Paddle</p>
<p>The ball and paddle are exactly the same as in ordinary rules, so they will not be described further.</p>
<p>Rules Content</p>
<p>Round table tennis is derived from regular table tennis, and its rules are largely similar to the original rules. However, due to differences in shape, position, equipment setup, and number of players, some aspects cannot be exactly the same. The differences are listed below. (A) Three-Person Elimination System This is a game for three players simultaneously. Here are some points that differ from ordinary table tennis:</p>
<p>(1) (Position) The positions of the three players should be determined by drawing lots. The first draw can choose the best position and the right to serve, the second can choose the next best position, and the remaining position goes to the third player.</p>
<p>(2) (Scoring) Ordinary table tennis rules use a scoring system. Three-person round table tennis, due to the triangular league nature, should use a point-loss system. The first of the three players to lose 11 points loses the game. If three or two players each lose 10 points at the same time, then the person who loses two more points first loses the game.</p>
<p>(3) (Serve) The person who wins the right to serve is the server, and the other two players are the receivers. The server first tosses the ball up and hits it with the paddle so that the ball bounces in their own zone and then crosses the net, landing in any zone to the left or right. This is called a serve. The next right to serve is obtained by the person who loses points each time.</p>
<p>(4) (Receive) The person receiving the ball can return it to any two zones to the left or right, but cannot send it to the same zone three or more times in a row. For example: If Player A gives the ball to Player B, Player B can return it to Player A the first time. The second time Player A can give it back to Player B, and Player B can return it to Player A again. The third time, Player A cannot give it back to Player B and must give it to Player C. Otherwise, Players A and B will be playing forever, and Player C will be waiting forever, which would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>(5) (Elimination) The first of the three players to lose 11 points is eliminated and ranked third. Because the remaining two players cannot play round table tennis, their final ranking is determined by the number of points lost, with the player who loses fewer points ranked first and the player who loses slightly more points ranked second. If, at the time the first player is eliminated, the other two players have the same score, then the last point lost by the two players is counted. Whoever loses this point last is ranked first.</p>
<p>(B) Four-Person Elimination System</p>
<p>The rules for the four-person elimination system, such as position, scoring, serving, and elimination, are the same as in the two-person elimination system. Only the range of sending the ball is slightly changed. In the four-person system, the ball cannot be sent to the same zone twice or more in a row. Because the number of players is increased by one, the opportunity to send the ball also increases by one zone. The attacking range is expanded, which is beneficial to the attacking side. From the defense perspective, the more chances to attack, the harder it is to defend, and everyone is in danger, with a feeling of unease. Therefore, the number of times the ball is sent to the same zone should not exceed twice or more in a row. For example, the first time Player A gives the ball to Player B, Player B can return it to Player A the first time. The second time, Player A cannot give it back to Player B and must pass it to Player C or Player D.</p>
<p>(C) Four-Person Doubles System</p>
<p>Doubles is a game of competition between two teams of two players each. The positions chosen by both sides and the right to serve are determined by drawing lots. If the team that wins the draw is willing to serve or receive, then the other team has the right to choose the position. If the team that wins the draw wants to choose the position, then the other team has the right to decide to serve or receive first. However, the winner of the draw can still give the right to choose to their opponents if they wish. The two players on the same team stand facing each other in a straight line. The serving rules are the same as before. The target of the hit is of course to attack the two enemies to the left and right, but when necessary, it can also be shot into the zone of the teammate opposite them, to rest and wait for an opportunity to enter directly. However, it is not allowed to hit the same team zone twice or more in a row. Serving is not allowed into the same team's zone. The scoring method uses the scoring system, which is the opposite of the previous section. The side that scores 11 points first wins a game. Two wins out of three games determine the winner. The right to serve uses a rotating system, which is the same as in ordinary table tennis rules, so it will not be described further.</p>

<h3>Repeatedly Rising Prices in Other Cities Lead to Soaring Yarn Prices in Three Cities, Garrison Command Inspection Begins Investigation of Yarn Shop Account Books</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is reported that the recent continuous surge in yarn prices in Shanghai is largely due to rising prices in other cities. Taking the price of 20-count yarn as the standard, the Shenyang market price yesterday was still over 11 million yuan per piece. After being transported out of Tianjin, Shanghai's delayed yarn, which is deeper than Shenyang's, has changed its route to transit through Yingkou. The fact that the Shanghai yarn market has become stronger with the help of the Niuzhuang gang is no accident. It is also reported that, after the ban on exports from Tianjin, a new outlet has been found to transit through Beiping. Therefore, the market price of 20-count yarn in Tianjin has also rebounded and reached 7 million yuan. Qingdao yarn prices are similar to Tianjin. In other places such as Hankou, Jiangxi, and Guangzhou, the price of 20-count yarn is generally hovering between 6.5 and 6.6 million yuan. The Changsha price is about 6.6 to 6.7 million yuan. Furthermore, due to the recent brisk yarn market in the north, the daily transaction volume of cotton yarn sold to the north in this city is between 300 and 500 pieces.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] To suppress yarn prices and crack down on illegal speculative trading, the Garrison Command dispatched a large number of officers from the Economic Section of the Inspection Division, led by Zhang Yamin, starting yesterday. They were divided into 24 groups and launched investigations of account books in yarn shops throughout the city. At the same time, based on clues, they investigated the stored yarn in warehouses. Yesterday, because the thorough investigation work had just begun, no cases of significant severity had occurred. However, it is understood that this thorough investigation work will continue until the yarn market returns to normal.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Yarn Business Association, the reasons for recent fluctuations in the yarn market are: (1) Imbalance of supply and demand, (2) Imbalance of production costs and negotiated prices, (3) Imbalance of yarn prices in various places. With these three factors, it can be known that the rise in Shanghai yarn prices is by no means purely the result of speculative funds. It is hoped that the government will actively encourage and support industry and commerce, creating a profitable production business, so that speculative funds in the market will naturally tend towards production.</p>
<h3>Government Bond Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds saw activity shift to the stock market. Prices rose slightly initially, then fell, dragging down miscellaneous bonds as well. United C opened at 15,200 yuan, rose to 15,500 yuan, but sales from room 503 and retail sales pushed it back down to within 13,000 yuan before rebounding. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Class A and B bonds fell by 1,000 yuan, Class C bonds fell by 1,400 yuan, and Class D and E bonds also fell by 1,300 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Mostly Higher</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were boosted by the strange enthusiasm for black market exchange rates yesterday. Securities firms and Guangdong firms actively absorbed them. In the afternoon, a surge of new buying sparked the market. Ewo Cotton opened at 40,700 yuan, with a low price of 40,400 yuan, but rose to 44,500 yuan in the afternoon before slightly stabilizing. As a result, compared with last Saturday, steel and British companies each rose by a strong half, shipping rose by just under 10%, and Ewo Cotton, Jardine Matheson, Guangdong Paper, and Ewo Brewery each rose by 10%. The rest rose slightly. The Ministry of Finance has forwarded all relevant information to the Economic Commission for reference.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Adopts Import and Export Linked System</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has forwarded all relevant information to the Economic Commission for reference.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously requested the adoption of an import and export linked system. After submitting reports to the competent departments, the Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "The telegram and attachments have been received. The revised draft of the import and export trade adjustment measures, and the written opinions of Zhang Yujiu and Zhang Huanzhang on the study of the import and export trade linked system, have been forwarded by the Ministry of Finance to the National Economic Commission for review and reference."</p>
<h3>Xi'an and Guangzhou Need the Largest Denominations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to remedy the shortage of cash in various places, the Central Bank has decided to issue banknotes with a face value of 10,000 yuan. However, the issuance of these banknotes is currently limited to Xi'an and Guangzhou, which have the most severe cash shortages. In Xi'an, the recent arrival of new cotton requires a large amount of cash for purchase. In Guangzhou, a large amount of overseas remittances is pouring in, also requiring a large amount of cash. As a result, the exchange rates of various banks for these two places have been increasing daily. It is now reported that these large denomination cash banknotes will be transported to the two places for circulation in the near future. The cash panic in these two places is expected to be resolved. The high domestic exchange rate in these two places is also expected to be suppressed.</p>
<h3>Check Clearing Amount</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to statistics released by the Shanghai Clearing House: The total clearing amount in March was 11,890,980,997,466.94 yuan, the total number of cleared checks was 2,270,601, and the difference was 1,138,346,047,526.13 yuan. The daily averages were 475,639,239,898.67 yuan in amount, 90,824 in number of checks, and 45,533,841,901.04 yuan in difference. The number of clearing days in March was 25, and the average amount per cleared check was 5,236,933.40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Weak in Off-Season, Monthly Demand Less Than 1,000 Cases</h3>
<p>The black market price of rayon in this city broke the 10 million mark last week, differing by more than double the price allocated by the China Trust Bureau. According to the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau's agency sales: This rise in rayon is entirely artificial, and speculators deliberately raise prices when there is a shortage. In fact, rayon demand has entered the off-season. The silk weaving industry, which has the largest sales volume, has stopped production of its usual goods due to summer. The ribbon industry also cannot work after the summer season, so demand is greatly reduced. Only over 900 cases were distributed last month, and this month is not expected to exceed this number. At the peak, over 3,000 cases were distributed, which is more than two-thirds less. MacArthur Headquarters had promised to supply 5,000 cases per month, but this month it was not possible to distribute them in time due to transportation reasons. Recently, 2,500 cases were loaded onto a ship on the 15th and should arrive within days. As soon as they are received, they will be distributed in full according to the needs of each factory, and the allocated price will remain unchanged. The highest price per case, Tianqiao, is still 5.5 million, followed by Dongyang Jin Sanma, still at 5.3 million. Gaoshan Asahi is still at 5.2 million, and the market should stabilize.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Actively Absorbing, China Stocks See Another Peak</h3>
<p>China stocks saw renewed buying momentum yesterday due to a general rise in market prices. While some long positions in the industry were liquidated, they were still actively absorbed.

The opening prices were similar to the previous period. Due to active buying by northern gangs, sentiment was firm, and buying momentum started, each count of yarn rose again by 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>The price increases for cotton cloth became even more intense. It is reported that northern gangs and new buyers were still very interested, and the market continued to be strong.

<h3>Reasons for Rising Dye Prices: Hoarding Resurges, Tianjin Gang Actively Absorbing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Dye prices have recently risen again. A reporter recently visited relevant parties and summarized the reasons for the fluctuations as follows: (1) The number of newly recovered areas in the north has increased, and merchants from Tianjin are importing goods in large quantities, which raises prices due to supply and demand. (2) The prices of the main chemical raw materials for dyes have all increased, so dye prices have risen accordingly. (3) The main use of dyes is in dyeing dark-colored clothing. Their use is most prosperous after autumn. The current season is approaching early summer, and merchants are planning for autumn supplies, so the demand for dyes has increased. (4) From the lunar new year to today, dyes have generally been sluggish, mainly because commodity prices have not fluctuated much (except during the gold rush), and market interest rates are very high. Merchants are unwilling to bear high interest rates and store goods, so dye prices have fallen. However, with the current price increases and the approach of peak months, hoarding has become more prevalent, creating price fluctuations. In addition, the issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes will have some impact on market psychology.</p>
<h3>Oil Allocation Method Agreed Upon by the Transportation Management Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Import Quota Allocation Office of the Temporary Import Management Committee previously convened a meeting of registered importers of "Unlisted Oils and Waxes" to discuss the allocation of import quotas for oils and waxes from February to April of this year. At the meeting, the office announced that the prescribed quota for the above-mentioned goods for this quarter was 515,000 US dollars, of which about one-third had already been used to allocate to applications received before the end of January this year. The remaining two-thirds were allocated to 14 registered importers, and a distribution method was subsequently discussed and unanimously approved. Before the quota for this quarter was set, the office had received a very large number of import license applications since November of last year. According to the provisions of Public Announcement No. 1 A3 (B) of the Temporary Import Management Committee: Before the quota allocation method begins, all Appendix (II) goods (except for five types of goods for which import licenses are handled by the Import Management Office) applications for import licenses should be managed by the Quota Allocation Office, and efforts should be made to handle them. To take care of import applications that had not yet been completed before registration (these applications mostly represent goods ordered by import businesses), it was decided to use part of the quota to clear old cases. All goods with a large number of applications received before the quota was set were cleared in this way to balance the situation. However, this is only limited to this quarter. It is said that the portion of the quota allocated was fairly distributed based on the application figures, except for non-compliant applications.</p>
<h3>Another 38 Brokerage Firms Approved to Sell US Dollar Bonds, Yesterday's Fundraising Results Break Records</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In addition to the 81 previously approved brokerage firms in this city, it is now known that another 38 firms have been approved to sell 36-year short-term treasury bonds and US dollar bonds.

<h3>Provisional Suspension of Yarn Allocation Due to Failure to Submit Verification of Business Registration Certificate and Factory Number</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday officially announced the provisional suspension of yarn allocation to all factories that have not submitted verification of their business registration certificates.

There were a total of 1,185 application forms from manufacturers and 346 applications from yarn shops.</p>
<h3>No Improvement in Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Recently, in the foreign tea market, the appetite of exporters is extremely small, and transactions are as rare as the stars at dawn. The market momentum lacks the strength to rise. Among various teas sold domestically, except for the new Longjing tea of this year, the shops and businesses in this street and surrounding areas still have some sales, but the rest are sold sporadically. The trend consistently maintains a balanced and hovering state.</p>
<h3>9 Billion in Loans for Fujian Tea</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Fuzhou Dispatch, 21st] It is heard that the Agricultural Bank has approved 9 billion for tea loans in the Fujian region this year, to be undertaken and distributed to various tea companies by the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Company.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Tend to Soften</h3>
<p>The sugar market is showing a daily decline. Yesterday, 200,000 "Qing Jiao" offered by the brokers attracted no interest. Xinghua white sold for 310,000, then 300,500, then 300,300 yuan. Xinghua red sold for 200,600 yuan, with over 200 baskets transacted. Hainan foreign sugar sold for 195,000 yuan, with only 20-30 bags transacted. Zhang Diao also opened with a price of only 192,500 to 195,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qinhuangdao Coal Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Hai Huang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Qinhuangdao, carrying 3,000 tons of coal, now docked at Yangjiadu Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The second batch of 150 tons of national cotton purchased by the China Textile Construction Corporation in Shaanxi arrived in Shanghai on April 19. More than 1,000 tons are still being transported in succession, all of which are being transported by Jiang'an Industrial Company.</p>
<h3>Parallel Market Prices Soar</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Prices in Taiyuan are rising again, especially for food and cloth. Compared with the lowest prices after the announcement of the economic measures plan, millet has risen from 140,000 to 200,000 per shi, top-grade flour has risen from 80,000 to 98,000 per bag, and Mingxing cloth has risen from 200,000 to 290,000.</p>
<h3>Nanchang Grain Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] Prices here are stabilizing daily. Except for silk cloth, which continues to rise sharply, the rest are declining, especially since the government has held flat-price sales, and the grain shortage has been resolved. Today, late rice is 90,000, medium-ripening rice is 88,000, Qi rice is 83,000, and coarse rice is 89,000 on the grain market.</p>
<h3>The Surge in Copper and Tin Prices Has Stopped; Hardware Prices Will Fall Back</h3>
<p>The surge in copper and tin prices has stopped, and most goods are trending towards a stable state. Only refined steel ingots are very scarce in the market, and prices continue to rise. The wholesale price for large quantities is 10 million yuan per ton, and the wholesale price per market dan is also quoted at 550,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: The market price of hardware products rose significantly last week, and yesterday the market situation also weakened slightly, with all goods remaining stagnant. According to observations by people in the industry: This surge was purely due to a restless state after a long period of quiet, caused by agitation in people's minds during times of confusing rumors. Therefore, most of the prices were just quoted, and actual sales were not strong. It is expected that prices will gradually decline again.</p>
<h3>Increased Arrivals and Price Drops; Rice Market Still Has No Normal Trading; Flour Slightly Down, Oil Market Temporarily Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the rice market had not improved. The north and south markets only had allocated prices and no trading prices among businesses. However, customers registering for goods were coming in an endless stream, and prices in the producing areas had also fallen slightly. Yesterday, the north and south markets received a total of 9,200 dan of rice. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to release 9,000 bags of white japonica and Saigon red indica rice at regular prices, and the market transaction was slack. The high price of japonica and indica rice was set, but then retreated by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and white yuan also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, similar to the risk yuan.</p>
<p>Flour transactions were cold and sluggish, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran, on the other hand, became popular for rural sales, rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were actively sought after by customers, and the market was thriving, rising slightly by 300 to 400 yuan. Yellow soybeans were sluggish in sales, and the market was flat and weak, showing a softening trend.</p>
<p>The Shantou market opened lower, and turned strong at the close, but the result was not much turbulence. Oil allocation continued as usual. Mung beans from Nanyang were still popular, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Red beans also turned to rise by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan, and broad beans rose again by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were stable after falling, sesame was in the downstream, corn was sluggish, and red sorghum was temporarily flat.</p>
<p>Investigating Rice Shops</p>
<p>In order to suppress rice prices, the authorities recently stipulated that rice shops must not sell rice above the specified price limit, and those who violate this will be severely punished. However, there are still some rice shops that dare to outwardly comply but inwardly defy, neither displaying price tags at the rice shop storefront nor selling at black market prices of 170,000 to 190,000 yuan, or mixing rice with other grains in an attempt to profit illegally. In view of this, the municipal authorities, in addition to hoping that citizens will assist in reporting at any time, yesterday specially dispatched commissioner Huang Jiaju, together with Wu Yimin from the Social Affairs Bureau, to go to various districts to conduct on-site investigations of rice shops to see if there were any illegal rice sales. The main points of the investigation are: (1) Whether the rice shop displays a price tag indicating the limited rice price, (2) Whether the retail rice is mixed with other grains, (3) Whether there are any discrepancies in the rice shop's transaction books. If it is found through investigation that there are indeed illegal acts, they will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>Siamese Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Xia ship arrived last Friday from Siam carrying more than 2,000 tons of rice, as previously reported. It is now learned that Jardine Matheson's Rong Sheng ship also arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, carrying 2,000 tons (20,000 bags) of Siamese rice, now docked at Huangpu Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Shipping Cloth to the South; Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association Asks for Lifting of Ban</h3>
<p>The provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have always felt a shortage of cloth, relying on the supply from this city. The provinces of Guangxi and the counties in eastern Guizhou also rely on Guangdong for transshipment. Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs restricted the shipment of cloth from this city to Guangdong and Fujian in September last year, the supply sources of these provinces have been cut off, and the supply and demand have become even more disconnected. In recent months, the market price of cloth has soared, which is quite alarming. The general price level has also been greatly affected, and people's livelihood is in extreme pain. The Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, in view of this, yesterday specially presented nine reasons to the authorities, appealing for the lifting of the ban, and telegraphed the relevant agencies and groups, asking for their support.</p>

<h3>Watching the Yellow River Return to Its Old Course: Can We Avoid Breaches in This Year's Flood Season?</h3>
<p>—Jinan, 14th, Air Mail Report, Our Special Correspondent, Fan Lifu</p>
<p>Participating in the Yellow River Tour Group</p>
<p>Thanks to the initiation of Director Fan Qijun of the Sui District News Office, this reporter was able to join the spring tour group visiting the Yellow River after it returned to its old course. On the morning of the 14th, we set off from the News Office in a jeep, passed through the Tianqiao area, and drove out of the bustling city. Although we were met with a vast expanse of yellow sand from the north, what caught our eye along with the yellow sand was a stretch of new green: green mountains, green water, green locust trees, green willows, green wheat seedlings, and green fragrant grass, stretching endlessly as far as the eye could see. This was the first time in two months that this reporter, confined within the city of Jinan by the Communist forces, truly experienced the arrival of spring and breathed in the unique, fresh earthy aroma emanating from the fields after spring's arrival. I deeply felt the loveliness and greatness of our motherland.</p>
<p>We first lingered for an hour at the Wuliu Lock on the Xiaoqing River, about ten miles from Jinan, where the lanes were lined with weeping willows and the water was as clear as a mirror, reminiscent of the scenery of southern China. Then, we drove straight to Luokou. This is a small town on the banks of the Yellow River. To prevent flooding, the town is surrounded by neat and solid walls, and the north wall is built right next to the riverbank. Standing on the city wall, we saw the renowned Yellow River Iron Bridge, stretching over a thousand meters, lying horizontally to the east. To the west of the bridge, there was originally a wooden bridge built by the enemy and puppet regime after the Yellow River changed its course. This spring, when the Yellow River flowed eastward, it was demolished to avoid being washed away, and replaced with a ferry, so as to facilitate travelers. The ferry fare is 400 yuan per person, 800 yuan per handcart including person, and 18,000 yuan per three-horse carriage. To the east of the bridge, several steel-reinforced concrete piers were built during the enemy and puppet period. Originally, the enemy planned to build another cement bridge here to allow public transport vehicles to pass and to dismantle the existing iron bridge and move it elsewhere. However, the cement bridge was not completed before the Japanese surrendered, and it did not come to fruition. We all could not help but rejoice for this iron bridge that was to be removed but never got removed. If we wanted to rebuild this long bridge today, I don't know how much hardship the Railway Bureau would have to endure?</p>
<p>Snakes and Toads Become River Gods</p>
<p>The water of the Yellow River is much more turbid than that of the Yangtze River, and the current is also much more turbulent than that of the Yangtze River. According to the survey by the River Conservancy Bureau, the width of the river today is 649 meters, the flow rate is 0.81 meters per second, the flow is 127.51 cubic meters per second, and the water depth is 6 meters. Compared with three days ago, it has dropped by 7 decimeters. The peach flood, one of the four annual floods, can be safely passed! When this gratifying news spread, it suddenly increased the vitality of those watching the Yellow River. So we walked slowly eastward along the river embankment, which is also the city wall, and unknowingly came to the northeast corner of the city wall. Here, there is a gate on the side of the city wall, and there are stone steps leading directly to the riverbank. Hundreds of villagers are rushing to the river to fetch Yellow River water with bottles and jars. There is also a small temple next to the right corner of the wall gate, enshrining the "Golden Dragon God Great King" in the center, and the positions of Generals Zhang and Yang on both sides. The villagers first place the bottles of Yellow River water they have fetched in front of the shrine, then rotate the burning incense over the bottles containing Yellow River water, then insert the incense into the incense burner, kneel and worship, and then take back the bottles and jars. According to the villagers, this Yellow River water, after being boiled, can be swallowed into the stomach with the mud to cure all diseases. The Golden Dragon God Great King that is being worshipped is one of the Great Kings responsible for governing the river, and legend has it that the snakes in the Yellow River are his incarnations. As for the generals, there are also three, and the toads are his predecessors, assisting in governing the Yellow River, so villagers will worship and burn incense as if they were gods even if they find a very small snake or a large toad on the riverbank. They only pass on to each other that on the day the Yellow River changed its course eight years ago, the sky above Jinan was filled with red clouds and thunder rumbled for more than two hours, but there was no rain. Since then, the Yellow River has not come again! Eight years later, the Yellow River returned to its old course. They don't know that this is due to the Huayuankou damming, but only follow the old legends, regarding it as a divine event and believing that the returning river water can cure diseases. This ancient legend, which still lingers among the people along the Ganges River in India and the Nile River in Egypt, how could they understand that science has progressed to the atomic age of the 20th century? This truly represents the group of the absolute majority of the Chinese descendants.</p>
<p>Seven Changes of Course, the People Cannot Bear Their Fate</p>
<p>Opening up history, everyone knows that this great river is the birthplace of the brilliant and long-standing Chinese culture, and also the cradle of the Chinese nation. However, since historical records began, it has changed its course seven times and breached its banks 1,580 times, countless lives and properties have been lost, and the nation's vitality has been damaged. Therefore, what the Yellow River has left to the people of the country is only countless painful memories. The 1,580 breaches are too numerous to remember. Here, let's just list the seven changes of course!</p>
<p>First time: In the fifth year of King Ding of Zhou (602 BC), it breached at Liyang (now Junxian), and entered the Bohai Sea via Tianjin.</p>
<p>Second time: In the third year of Wang Mang's Shijian Kingdom (11 AD), it breached in Weijun, and entered the sea at Qiancheng.</p>
<p>Third time: In the eighth year of the Qingli reign of Emperor Renzong of Song (1048 AD), it breached at Shanghu, and entered the sea at Tianjin, forming the northern stream. In the eighth year of the Taiping Xingguo reign of Emperor Taizong, it breached at Huaizhou, and entered the Yangtze and Huai Rivers at Pengcheng, called the southern stream.</p>
<p>Fourth time: In the fifth year of the Shaoxi reign of Emperor Guangzong of the Southern Song Dynasty, that is, the fifth year of the Mingchang reign of Emperor Zhangzong of Jin (1194 AD), it breached at Yangwu, and the northern stream entered the sea through the Daqing River, and the southern stream entered the sea through the Nanqing River. Fifth time: In the fifth year of the Hongzhi reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Ming (1492), it breached at Jinlongkou, and diverted the Wen River into the sea.</p>
<p>Sixth time: In the fifth year of Xianfeng reign of Emperor Qing (1855), it breached at Tongwaxiang, and entered the sea along today's river course.</p>
<p>Seventh time: In June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, it breached at Huayuankou, Henan.</p>
<p>This last Huayuankou course change overflowed the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, causing the country to reduce its agricultural crop yield by more than 1.5 million tons per year, and displacing more than 6.1 million people. According to the conclusions jointly researched by Chinese and foreign water conservancy experts, the best plan is to dam the breach, restore the dikes, and guide the river back to its old course. Therefore, starting last spring, the damming project began, and it was finally completed on March 15 this year. The river dikes have also been tasked to the provincial River Conservancy Bureaus to be repaired in sections. The dike restoration project from Qhe to Jiyang within the territory of the National Army in Shandong Province has been completed in eight months, with more than 900,000 cubic meters of earthwork completed, the main dike raised 9 decimeters above the Hong Yong position, and more than 10,000 cubic meters of stone materials collected and transported. All the stones below the middle water level have been repaired. All the projects in this section have been completed by 80%. However, the current problem is that the river course in Shandong Province has been abandoned for eight years. After investigation, it was found that the north and south dikes in western Shandong and the downstream Huimin and Lijin areas under the control of the Communist Army have not been repaired, and the people's dikes taken over by the government have also not been repaired. The dikes are thin and unable to withstand floods. Although the peach flood has been safely passed due to the small water flow, the fall, autumn, and ice floods, especially the fall flood that will arrive in two or three months (that is, July), may cause huge disasters if the repairs are not done well. The dike section in western Shandong that has recently been recovered by the National Army is particularly urgent and needs to be repaired immediately. According to Engineer Chen Yungong of the River Conservancy Bureau, in the past, the Yellow River Conservancy had to gather the strength of the whole country to carry it out. In addition to the specialized river administration organs, river administration and water conservancy have become an important task for officials of all dynasties to govern the people. Even judging from the late Qing Dynasty or before the war, in terms of (1) flood organization, Shandong Province initially had 18 river defense camps with more than 1,600 employees dedicated to repairing and guarding the river. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, it was changed to 18 sections, with more than 1,300 employees. At that time, the total length of the official dike was 750 kilometers, and there was still a feeling that the employees were not enough. This year, the total number of flood soldiers approved for the Shandong section of the flood organization is 600, and there are 150 staff members. The people's dikes in western Shandong are also returned to government control. With 750 employees to repair and guard more than 900 kilometers of dikes, each 1.5 kilometer section of the dike only has one flood soldier. If there is a dangerous project, and you want to rush to cover it, how can you be flexible? (2) In terms of river defense materials: Before the war, trees were planted on both the north and south banks, stretching as far as the eye could see. Materials were taken locally, and there was no need to worry about shortages. If there was a need for wood materials 30 to 40 miles along the river, they could be collected at any time. In addition, the flood control funds were sufficient, totaling 540,000 yuan per year, plus more than 200,000 yuan for rescue assistance, totaling more than 700,000 yuan. According to the usual practice, materials were purchased in winter, and all the broken or incomplete weirs were repaired completely when the freeze thawed in the spring. The materials needed for flood control could also be obtained readily. Now, the trees along the river have been almost completely felled, and the wood materials are also extremely scarce and difficult to collect. Moreover, the flood control funds approved this year are only 1 billion yuan for the three provinces, and Shandong Province is less than 300 million yuan, so all kinds of materials cannot be stored in large quantities, and can only be purchased for 4% of the planned quantity. (3) Regarding defense: Before the war, due to the siltation of the riverbed over the years, the water level in each county along the river was often 5 to 6 feet higher than the ground outside the dike during large floods. Therefore, all officials and civilians concentrated their efforts to jointly protect the river. The county magistrates and commissioners of the counties along the river also personally led the people to patrol the dikes day and night. Today, however, the local order has not been restored, the government orders cannot be unified, the repairs cannot be unified, the protection cannot be coordinated, and strong men flee one after another. If there is a dangerous project, the difficulties are really unimaginable. (4) Regarding telecommunications equipment, transportation, and personnel: The key to flood control information is to be well-informed. Before the war, there were long-distance telephones along the river, and there were also radio stations. During each large flood, the water situation and engineering conditions could be transmitted to the entire river at any time. In terms of transportation, cars could travel smoothly along the dike, and there were many ships in the river. During the flood control period, hundreds of civilian ships could be concentrated. It was convenient for both the employees to travel back and forth and the materials to be transported. Now, the long-distance telephones and river ships have been completely destroyed, and radio stations have not been set up. Cars also cannot pass on the dikes. Comparing the present with the past, how can it be different?</p>
<p>Failure to Do One's Best, Breaches Are Inevitable</p>
<p>With the existence of the above-mentioned actual difficulties, if we do not catch up and try to remedy the situation quickly, then the large flood period that is approaching will not only be possible, but also absolutely expected. According to expert surveys, during the great flood in the 31st year of the Republic of China, the maximum flood flow in Shanzhou reached 28,000 cubic meters per second. After deducting the consumption along the way, the flow to Shandong was about 17,000 cubic meters per second, while the maximum water storage capacity of the Shandong river channel is only 8,000 cubic meters per second. If we still cannot do our best, it is really impossible to avoid the breaches during this year's flood season. If there is a breach in Liuzhuang, Dongzhuang, and other places where the Dang and Lu border, it can overflow the old Caozhou Prefecture area, and go down to Jiaxiang, Jining, Yutai, and other counties, and pass through the four lakes of Nanyang, Zhaoyang, Dushan, and Weishan, and divert the canal south, and enter the Bulao River through Lanjia Dam, and irrigate northern Jiangsu, causing a huge disaster, affecting the project of guiding the Huai River and regulating the canal. If there is a breach on the south bank of Qidong, it can overflow Qingcheng, Gaoyuan, Boyu, Guangrao, and other counties. If there is a breach on the north bank, it can overflow Jiyang, Huimin, Bin County, Zhanhua, Putai, Lijin, Wudi, and other counties.</p>
<p>The reasons for the Yellow River disasters in the past, except for the seventh course change which was due to the war of resistance to stop the Japanese army from advancing westward, were mostly due to misplanning by the people. Therefore, historians often regard the Yellow River as a symbol of China's governance. Some people also believe that the time when the Yellow River advances to having no floods forever, and turns harm into benefit, will be the day when China's great cause of nation-building is truly completed. A week ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party telegraphed the Yellow River Committee that the National Army had destroyed the river dikes 40 miles below Youcheng (that is, Wang Hedui), which was refuted by the Yellow River Committee. According to military observers, this is very likely to be a scheme by the Communist Party to obstruct the advance of the National Army in western Shandong and to not hesitate to breach the dikes when necessary in order to shift the blame on others. Now that this is not the case, what the people of Shandong are hoping for from the government is, under the premise of putting the interests of the people first, to do the following: passively, to persuade the Communist Party not to use the Yellow River as any strategic or tactical tool; and to work together with the Communist Party to do the greatest effort to increase the funds for repairing and restoring the dikes, strengthen the river dike project, and stop the current crisis; actively, according to the plan drafted by Dr. Savage, Lieutenant General Shippers, and Mr. Groton, to treat the Yellow River fundamentally, forever eliminate future troubles, and make this cradle of the Chinese nation and the birthplace of Chinese culture no longer a "disaster water" but truly be able to continue to nurture and promote civilization for hundreds of millions of years to come.</p>

<h3>Private Smugglers Innocent, Security Team Members Sentenced to Hard Labor: A Regrettable Incident by the Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou, 28th (Airmail Dispatch) - Special Correspondent Liang Feng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because Guangdong and Hong Kong are too close geographically and are governed by two different national governments, that unpleasant incidents seem to occur continuously, following the change of seasons. Is it that Chinese people deliberately create trouble? Or is it the Hong Kong government's contempt for us? We will set aside the rights and wrongs and the causal relationship for now. However, just as the Huang Shuixiang and Zhang Tianxiang bloodshed cases can勉强 be said to be in the past, and the indignation of our people has not yet completely subsided, the Hong Kong government has recently created another shocking incident of sheltering smugglers, detaining soldiers of our provincial government's security team, and sentencing them to imprisonment. This cannot but make us feel even more deeply regrettable!</p>
<p>The incident occurred on February 6th of this year. The Guangdong provincial authorities, having received reports of many smugglers specializing in illegally exporting grain, causing panic and soaring prices in the province, issued emergency measures, setting up a blockade line to prevent the clandestine export of grain. At that time, the 10th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Security Regiment under the jurisdiction of the provincial government was stationed in Shatoujiao, Bao'an County, responsible for anti-smuggling operations. As the area bordered Guangdong and Hong Kong, strict inspection was necessary. On February 6th, the team received a tip from an informant that smugglers were illegally transporting grain from the waters near Baishizhou. They immediately dispatched four soldiers, including Guo Xiangmin, in a small boat to intercept them. They indeed saw a boat coming from Baishizhou and ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the boat refused to stop and opened fire. A three-masted sailing ship (license number Macau 9326A) and two smaller boats assisted the vessel, firing a barrage of gunfire at Guo Xiangmin and his men, killing security team members Guo Xiangmin and Ye Qihuan on the spot. The remaining two men, Wu Guisheng, and others, along with all their firearms, were captured by the smugglers and handed over to the Pingshan Police Station in the British territory. They were later transferred to the Kowloon Magistracy for trial.</p>
<p>Request for Release Ignored</p>
<p>After the incident, the Guangdong provincial government immediately contacted the Hong Kong government through proper channels, requesting the release of the captured team members and the return of the confiscated firearms. However, the Hong Kong government ignored our request. Subsequently, on March 22nd, Hong Kong newspapers suddenly published a news item stating, "Two men, Wu Guisheng, and others, who claimed to be members of the security team, were convicted in the High Court yesterday morning and sentenced to four years of hard labor each. In court, they requested the judge to telephone Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, but the translator instructed them to apply to the prison warden themselves. The charges against the two defendants were three: (1) Using military weapons to attack others, intending to rob Huang Man and six others, and committing assault and robbery; (2) Intentionally damaging the bodies of others, committing the crime of attempted murder by shooting; (3) Illegally possessing a short gun, six bullets, a handgun, a light machine gun, a mortar, twenty-three rifle bullets, and a grenade, committing the crime of concealing military weapons." As for the six smugglers, including Huang Jin, who opened fire and killed Guo Xiangmin, and others, the chief prosecutor, Mr. Askew, originally charged them with "manslaughter" and "concealing military weapons." Later, the Hong Kong government's Attorney General believed that "since the charges against the security team have been established, legally speaking, the charge of manslaughter against the defendants cannot be established, as they are deemed to have opened fire in self-defense." Therefore, when the trial opened, they were only charged with illegally possessing five long guns, five fishing cannons, and one hundred and eighty-three bullets. Thus, even the so-called "manslaughter" charge was dropped!</p>
<p>Safeguarding National Rights, Upholding the Law</p>
<p>When this news arrived, the people of Guangzhou were extremely indignant. The provincial government also issued a statement, saying: "Our country's security team members were ordered to intercept smuggled ships in our national territorial waters. Their mission was legitimate and cannot be slandered. The smugglers dared to open fire to resist inspection, killing and capturing team members, disregarding the law, and seizing weapons, which is extremely hateful. In order to safeguard national rights and uphold the law, this government is now negotiating with the British through diplomatic channels to return the team members and weapons and extradite the three-masted fishing boat and all the smuggler criminals who resisted inspection, committed murder, and robbery to this province for investigation and prosecution according to law. It is believed that the British authorities will be able to distinguish right from wrong, consider national relations, and resolve the matter satisfactorily, so that the incident will not escalate and the friendship between Guangdong and Hong Kong can be maintained."</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Hong Kong to Lodge Representations</p>
<p>Currently, negotiations on this incident are still underway. The Guangdong provincial government has formally sent a document to the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, lodging representations to the Governor of Hong Kong, and has dispatched representatives of the security team to Hong Kong to handle the matter specifically. Although there has been no result yet, we believe that the British people, who have always prided themselves on abiding by the law, will certainly not disregard human relations and legal principles and disrespect their ally in the war against a common enemy!</p>
<h3>News from Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Express Dispatch on the 16th - Special Correspondent Fang Canglang of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Ferocious, Steady, Stupid – Words of Subtle Insight</p>
<p>The mopping-up campaign in the Yimeng Mountain area has been launched smoothly under the steady and reliable command of Generals Gu Zhutong and Tang Enbo. According to captured Communist military political personnel, senior Communist military commanders once made the following one-word assessments of senior Nationalist military generals, such as assessing Chen Cheng as "Ferocious," Gu Zhutong as "Steady," Xue Yue as "Fierce," and Liu × as "Stupid." Although these assessments may not be entirely accurate, they contain subtle insights. For example, the repeated defeats of the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong have already demonstrated the "Fierceness" of Xue's army. The fact that the Nationalists recovered more than 180 counties occupied by the Communists north and south of the Yellow River in just over half a year demonstrates "Ferociousness". During the fierce battle on the outskirts of Xuzhou, tens of thousands of Communist troops suddenly switched sides. One can only imagine the "Ferociousness" of the Chief of Staff who lightly waves his feather fan. As for capturing Tai'an in an instant and besieging the desperate bandits in the remote mountains, one cannot help but admire the "Steadiness" of Commander-in-Chief Gu, who is as steady as Mount Tai, and force them to hastily produce white flags.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu's Era - Mountain Warfare</p>
<p>After the mountain warfare began, this war has regressed from the atomic age to the era of Sun Tzu. This is the saying of a famous general stationed in Southern Anhui. The Communists, who have now retreated to the Yimeng Mountain area, only think about preserving their strength to prolong their lives and dare not defend dangerous positions to the death. Large-scale offensive and defensive battles will not occur in the Yimeng Mountain area. Both sides are using Sun Tzu's Art of War to seek victory. Examining the mountains of Shandong, the mountains in the triangular area of ​​central and southern Shandong are collectively called the Taiyi Mountains (ie, Mount Tai and Mount Yi). Mount Tai is located northeast of Tai'an County, and its main peak reaches 1,545 meters. Mount Yi is located northwest of Yishui County in southern Shandong and is only 990 meters high. Other famous mountains in Shandong, such as Mount Meng near Mengyin and Mount Yi and Mount Ni, are all under 700 meters in height. These mountainous areas have mineral resources such as coal, iron, and glass, as well as forests, but agricultural products are very scarce, making them unsuitable for long-term defense. Judging from the current situation, after the successful Nationalist search and suppression campaign in Mount Meng, the clearing of bandits from the mountains of Taiyi will not take too long. Although there is a saying in the Chinese bandit suppression proverb that "bandits in the mountains are easy to eliminate, but bandits in the heart are difficult to remove," under the wise decision of the Nationalist senior commanders to "attack the heart first," it is believed that after the people in the mountains have exhausted their millet porridge, they will definitely come out to change their taste and assist the Nationalists to shorten this annoying war.</p>
<p>Tai'an and Yan'an - National Prosperity and People's Peace</p>
<p>A week ago, when Tai'an and Yan'an were successively recovered by the Nationalist army, successive victories were reported from the front line, and sweet rain fell everywhere in the rear. Peace could be expected, and a wheat harvest was hoped for. The joy of the people in the recovered areas cannot be described in words. In the countryside of the recovered areas of North China, the people have suffered greatly from the trampling of the Communist army. When they see the Nationalist army, they often automatically offer food and tea to comfort the troops. When the Nationalist army rewarded them with legal tender or other food, the women often shed tears and told of their past suffering and the crimes of the Communist army, crying and saying: "I would rather have the Central Government eat it all than have the Eighth Route Army call me 'Auntie'." Sweet words and honeyed words are the specialty of the Communist political commissars. When they visit a civilian's home and see men and women of advanced age, they address them respectfully as "Uncle" and "Auntie" (this is the customary term in Xuzhou and Shandong for uncle and aunt). If their demands are not met, their ferocious faces are immediately revealed. Therefore, when the people of Xuzhou and Shandong hear a stranger call them "Uncle" or "Auntie," their hair immediately stands on end. It is also heard that after the news of the successive recoveries of Tai'an and Yan'an spread to North China, the people in the recovered areas excitedly told each other: The Central Government has recovered Tai'an and Yan'an. From now on, the war can be shortened, and national prosperity and people's peace can be expected. It can be seen that the people in the war zone eagerly hope for peace, and everyone hates war and prays for peace, and the war can be shortened. After the recovery of Tai'an, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was concerned about the refugees in the war zone, who have suffered from displacement and separation due to the disruption of transportation by the Communist army in recent years. In addition to ordering the relevant authorities to rush to provide emergency relief to the recovered areas, he also issued a hand-written order to the Ministry of Transportation to quickly repair the railroad north of Lincheng on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, so that displaced refugees can return to their homes and engage in production this summer. It is heard that the person in charge of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Engineering Office is working day and night to rush the repairs and expects to reach Tengxian by the middle of this month. If the materials needed for road construction can be continuously transported, it can reach Yanzhou by the end of May, restoring railway transportation on the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section. It is also heard that the Ministry of Transportation is making every effort to concentrate road construction equipment to carry out the restoration project of the entire Tianjin-Pukou Line. If there are no unexpected difficulties, the railway traffic between Pukou and Jinan may be repaired by the end of September this year. With the restoration of traffic in Pukou and Jinan, the opening of the entire Tianjin-Pukou Line can be expected soon. According to careful estimates, by the end of this year, it will not be extravagant to take a train directly from Nanjing to Peiping to spend the New Year. Under the unanimous national belief of "Military First, Transportation First," this is indeed good news.</p>
<p>Seductive Songs, Making People Forget Their Worries</p>
<p>With the changes in the war situation north and south of the Yellow River, Xuzhou has a new atmosphere. This month, the gentle breeze arrives, and the sweet rain falls. The tigers cross the river, and the wolves enter the mountains. Those who kill are killed (a military officer, Guo Yuzhou, was executed for committing murder for money), and those who smuggle are arrested (the Lu headquarters rectified military discipline and listed this as a prohibited item). Public security must be ensured, the roads must be renovated, and food is not allowed to be exported (food prices have recently fluctuated slightly). Jazz music can relieve sorrows (Pengcheng has three dance halls. In the evening, shadows of dancers flutter, and seductive songs make people forget their worries). Overall, it is not bad for the so-called military city of Xuzhou to have such a phenomenon.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on Reading Poetry</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>The poems written by predecessors to praise spring are all mediocre and lack novelty. When I read Su Pingzhong's line, "A clear stream encircles the fish market, a thin horse seeks fragrance, trampling on swallow's mud," and Wang Anshi's line, "Ancient plains, cattle nibble on new grass, small courtyards, bees flirt with newly opened flowers," I feel that they are delicate and not vulgar, all of which are things that people have not yet talked about.</p>
<p>Matters of the nether world are generally not discussed, as they are not easily rendered in a fitting manner. There is the poem by Jiong Zhang, "A graceful ghost woman walks at night, a black lantern illuminates her pair of shoe prints, the moss on her face is unclear, still carrying the peach color of her former life." Writing about seeing a monster in the wilderness makes people's hair stand on end. As for Tang Weiyuan's poem on the coffin of a deceased girl, "In broad daylight, she fears people and clings to the old mound, at dusk, she seeks companions and howls in the lonely village," then Xiao Hui not only has an otherworldly beauty but also the emotions of a young girl, vividly displayed on paper.</p>
<p>Writing scenery is easy, writing emotions is difficult. The poems and lyrics of mourning the dead that can move people in ancient and modern times are rare. Nalan Rongruo wrote the most lyrics mourning the dead, but except for "When will this hatred end? Dripping empty steps, cold nights cease. The weather for burying flowers. Three years, the soul dreams are distant, should the dream be long awake!" the rest did not have many moving places. Shen Deqian's Qixi 感事 has the couplet: "Only living separation, no death, after all, heaven is better than the human world." Although it does not directly sing of mourning the dead, the sad emotion of mourning the dead is fully revealed on paper; to say that there is no poem in Shen's collection that surpasses these two lines is probably not false.</p>
<p>Su Shi's "Shuangxi Collection" was seen in the Yueya Hall Series. The poems published are mostly ancient and lyrical, deliberately using allusions, with little to be taken. However, in the first rhyme of Hong Liuzhang's resident Su Huang Horse Ticket, the opening sentence is: "A long cry from the heavenly stables rises like a hairy dragon, ten thousand horses are all dark, suddenly one is in the middle." It feels majestic and powerful.</p>
<p>Lian Wenfeng's poems are generally clear and beautiful, expressing the spirit of nature, without the trivial habits of the poets of the late Song Dynasty. His self-deprecating couplet says: "In the idle door, there are few things, and I know that poverty is good; in adversity, there is much sorrow, and I hate that death is late." The artistic conception is extraordinary and does not fall into the usual path.</p>
<p>In Bai Zhengji's collection, the paired lines often use stacked words, such as "Walking on the lake in spring": "Good flowers are similar every year, but white clouds and stars are no longer mysterious." Sending a friend back to Yue: "The wild geese go away quickly in the autumn wind, the startled magpies perch in the lonely night moon." Autumn thoughts in response to Qiu Renjin's sending: "The reeds are withering in the autumn sickness, the family mountain is in the dream, the road is winding." Presented to Zhao Servant: "The white colt is bright and clear in the empty valley, the autumn water is beautiful and bright in itself." Diaotai says: "The stones are adjacent to each other in the late years, a thread of floating interest in empty fame," and so on.</p>
<p>The farmer Lu Dian's "Piya" is a popular book, but his name as a poet is not obvious, probably because not much of his work has been handed down. Fang Hui's Yingkui Lvsui said that Dian and Hu Su's poetic styles are similar, but Su's poems have been handed down a little more, while Dian's poems are not generally seen. Now, according to the "Taoshan Collection," there are still more than two hundred poems, mostly seven-character recent style, and those in the second rhyme account for seven or eight out of ten.</p>
<p>Lu Dian has eight poems mourning the dead, the concluding sentence of the second poem: "The beauty has gone to immortality without news, the intestines are broken by the spring breeze, a courtyard of flowers." The concluding sentence of the eighth poem: "Wandering in the cold evening, the sleeves are thin, the fallen flowers at the door, the yellow dusk of the moon." I think they are the most touching.</p>
<p>Lu Zhongyu's "Yan Qinglu": Lu Shan's claw injured Yang Guifei's breast, so Jin Cizi covered it up; Jin Kezi is also named Ke Lizhi. When I was seventeen years old, I filled in Taoyuan Yi Fang Ren Yong Yu, the first half of which said: "Huacheng first stopped in the silver screen, messy sideburns fell askew, Cui sleeves and cicada shirt faded, vaguely Ke Lizhi lived." That is, using this matter. But when I first learned to fill in the lyrics, the rules were mostly inaccurate, and the meaning was so frivolous, it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Chen Yuyi's sentence, "The guest gives me time in two volumes, the news of apricot blossoms in the sound of rain" was appreciated by Gaozong, and he was gradually promoted to executive; among the poets who crossed the south, he was the most prominent and far-reaching. Gao Di's rich words: "Small and big, separated by flowers, empty barking shadows, who comes to the palace in the deep night?" The two words caused disaster and led to death. It was not the clumsiness of poetry, but the different bearing of the emperor. Liu Jingxiu's poem: "If you use words to discuss the mind, I am afraid that there will be endless people who will suffer injustice," is the word of a true elder.</p>
<p>Jianzhai's five-character律诗, with rain as the theme, are the most numerous, and the poems with the theme of rain are the best. "For a while, the flowers are tearful, and thousands of miles of guests lean on the railing." "Ancient swamps give birth to spring waves, and high skies fall in the evening" are all extremely beautiful couplets. Even in ordinary lines of poetry, he often likes to use the word rain, such as "Rain passes, there are no peaches and plums" in "Tu Mi", "A sparse curtain of rain" in "Huai Shu in the Test Court", "Fine rain wets the green forest" on the shore, "Rain stops and comes quickly" on the road, "After the rain, the mountain wants to be near" in the evening walk, and so on are innumerable.</p>
<p>Shanjingju's poetic words record: Doucun Old Man made a living from poetry all his life, he must write every day, and he must save the draft, he did not stop chanting when he was over eighty years old. He also cherished it very much, and the work he made was hung on the roof beams, and he would not easily show it to close friends. He can be said to be addicted to poetry. Among the beautiful sentences recorded, I love the couplet the most: "Buying flowers does not count how much money, keeping guests, I forget that there is rice." And "The bottle flower is fine, bothering the bees to explore, the neighboring bamboo is affectionate, and the bamboo shoots come." The charm is as beautiful and light as this!</p>
<p>Qufang Chen Yuyi has a 萨蛮咏荷花云: "Nixuan faces the lotus root port, it is suitable for wind, moon and rain." Wu Song Huangtangtang's poem Yong Yanghua said: "It is not suitable for the wind, but suitable for the rain. When the time comes, I will see the falling time." A poem and a poem, both use wind and rain to write, proper and natural, and each reaches a wonderful realm.</p>
<p>Although Chen Mei's Yuanli's poems have never been famous, his poetic theories are mostly reasonable. His words are: "Poetry takes warmth and restraint as its body, and takes elegance and boldness as its use. Think deeply and adjust brightly. The grand poem does not fall into vulgarity, and the quiet poem does not fall into dullness. Magnificent sentences should be whole, not grouped; gentle sentences should be detailed, not clever. First, look at the meaning, second, look at the style, third, look at the sentence tone, and fourth, look at the charm; if all four are complete, it is a complete poem. Among the four, the meaning and charm are the main ones. One</p>
<p>Zeng Furen and Zhao Shiwu discussed poetry and books and said: "The younger brother once said that ancient poetry is more difficult than律诗, and five-character律诗 is more difficult than seven-character律诗. Du Shi's seven-character律诗 is all wonderful, but as for five-character律诗, the plain and ancient are half. Only Wang Meng's five-character律诗 is better than seven-character律诗, and it is almost a gift from heaven. For example, when Tao Ling was a great master of five-character律诗, there was no form of seven-character律诗; even if there was, and Tao made it, it may not be inferior to five-character律诗. It should not be said that five-character律诗 is easier." The argument is fair, and it is not possible to say this to those who have achievements in poetry.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaoting's poem mourning Zhaoto Huang said: "The fragrant grass by the road, the flowers in the road, picking it like looking at the autumn is far away, and the sorrowful desires to recruit, and I don't know who the clouds and rain are scattered to? After Sanlu died, it belonged to Qinglian, and the fame of Zizhi was also passed on. Since ancient times, talented people have been lustful, and talented people have never been immortals." Gai Tao Huang traveled to Chaling in his later years, and he was quite fond of him, and he died in his house; Xiaoting's poem is also satirizing him. Zou Yuan, a talented woman from Liangxi, has a posthumous collection "Yinan 小 唫" which is popular in the world. His poetry is far away, and he does not admire luxury. I especially love her rhythm on Jiao Mountain Peak: "The snails gradually go up the blue cloud ladder, the lush trees are lost on the temple path, the ancient crossing is far away, and Guabu is dim, the dangerous pole is horizontal and the sea gate is low; the clogs stick to the stone steps, the green moss is slippery, the sticks hang with smoke and thunder, and the green is wet. I want to ask Huayang Zhen's anecdotes, and Jiangyang embraces the setting sun again."</p>
<p>In April of the year of Bingzi, my brother Qin Changjin and I traveled to Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, and on the way back, we got the sentence "The setting sun is red over the Wuting Bridge," which I thought had the same artistic conception as Hong Beijiang's first work in West Lake, "The setting sun is red through the purple gauze."</p>
<p>I stayed at Bie Feng'an in Jiaoshan Town, Zhenjiang, and suddenly remembered Beijiang's poetic line: "Hawks and otters occupy the east and west ridges, waves and people compete for boats coming and going." Hawks and otters have no longer inhabited the four mountains, and the heavy rains are still surging with waves and people competing.</p>
<p>Since the death of Chun Dong, I have been afraid to read the poems of 陟岵 莪. Continuing Liu Xiang's explanation of Gao Yu's words in Shuoyuan, I have also sighed several times. Recently, I read the Song Lin Zizhen's poems of filial piety recorded in "Banjinglou Shihua," such as Yong Fan Pangyun: "I would rather block the disaster with my body than bear the separation of my mother. I will not do evil, and I have a word in the Yellow Spring now." Although the poem is not well-written, it is from the bottom of my heart, and I have shed tears.</p>
<p>According to the common custom, on the night of the Qixi Festival, ladies compete to mash balsam and dye their nails, which is said to be an elegant thing. Poets also often use dyed nails in poetry. Recently, I saw Jing An's poem: "Golden plate mixes dew and mashes the sunny clouds, and the red penetrates the slender jade shoots. Cui sleeves cage the fragrance and play the distant zither, and the green shade newly blooms with crabapple flowers." Zhu Shi actually stole from Yang Tieya's poem: "Night mash of the golden Phoenix pistil of the golden Phoenix, ten fingers are all replaced with red crow's beak, leisurely playing a piece of Yaqin, a few points of peach blossoms float on the flowing water." Xing Cijing's poem says: "Fingers are like jade shoots, and the inside is like silver. It is really enviable to skillfully dye them bright red. Playing the Yaoqin in the window, the colored strings are scattered with peach blossom petals." According to the two families, both of them are Minxiu, Zhu has "Ziyi Collection," and Xing has "Zhilan Bao Collection," each with a reputation for poetry. When I was seventeen years old, I learned to play the Magpie Bridge Immortal to dye nails: "Musk sprays golden ducks, and smoke adds orchid flames. The golden Phoenix flies into the deep steps. Lingbo steps towards the small courtyard, and then lightly puts the soft shoots to try to connect.</p>
<p>Just leaned on the vermilion railing, and silver zither was tuned again, and pieces of peach blossoms fell. How many times I think of entrusting my fragrant cheeks, I still suspect that it is the blush of beauty." The intention seems to be based on the two families, but the writing is superficial and unworthy of mention.</p>
<h3>Poets and Flowers</h3>
<p>— Yun Yi</p>
<p>Flowers are too closely related to our lives. We cannot imagine what we would feel if flowers disappeared from this universe. Our lives are decorated, beautified, and enlivened by the beautiful flowers around us, yet we often fail to notice their influence. Only poets sense their divine power and gladly write about them.</p>
<p>Among poets, Keats and Tennyson were particularly interested in flowers. They used flowers to enhance the vividness and realism of their descriptions and to express their emotions and reflections. However, after reading the poems of Keats and Tennyson, we find that although both loved flowers, the impact of the beauty of flowers on them was different.</p>
<p>Keats loved the sensory beauty of flowers. When he saw a beautiful flower, he suddenly felt delighted:</p>
<p>"O Wells! Roses come into view,</p>
<p>My senses are captivated by their fragrance."</p>
<p>He was a worshipper of abstract beauty. He believed that "truth" resided in "beauty," so when he saw a beautiful flower, he also saw the truth within it:</p>
<p>"They have words of murmuring complaints, truth, and deep friendship."</p>
<p>As for Tennyson, flowers often made him think of something else. Therefore, rather than saying he was appreciating beauty, it would be more accurate to say he was interpreting beauty:</p>
<p>"I plucked a daisy and brought it to you,</p>
<p>It will tell you what I have seen in England."</p>
<p>He thought of the arrival of spring when he saw snowdrops:</p>
<p>"Coming in the cold, herald of the happy season, prophet of May."</p>
<p>He believed that someone had walked by when he saw daisies turn red:</p>
<p>"I know the path she took home with a bouquet,</p>
<p>Because her feet brushed the grass, turning the daisies crimson."</p>
<p>In any case, both poets had the same enthusiasm for flowers. Keats wrote:</p>
<p>"Sniffing new passions on the flowers,</p>
<p>Telling him that in a world of happiness, I have you."</p>
<p>Tennyson, on the other hand, seemed to have an even more intense passion for flowers:</p>
<p>"Can I not have, can I not have a flower?</p>
<p>If nature does not care about</p>
<p>The blooming of flowers,</p>
<p>Who can live for a moment?</p>
<p>I must see flowers before I die!"</p>
<p>Having understood the impact of flowers on Keats and Tennyson and the reactions they elicited, we might as well take a look at how these two poets used flowers.</p>
<p>Keats talked about the sensory beauty of flowers more than Tennyson. He believed that any place became beautiful with flowers:</p>
<p>"The mountains are beautiful, look, the primroses are out."</p>
<p>Even just looking at flowers made him incredibly happy. The greatest joy in his life was the growth of flowers:</p>
<p>"What is so lovely as the little bee,</p>
<p>Pausing on a blooming flower?"</p>
<p>When he was exuberant, he liked to be with flowers:</p>
<p>"When my blood is feverish, I love to rest my head in the fragrance of roses."</p>
<p>"I fainted on a bed of flowers, intoxicated for three days."</p>
<p>He became happy in places with flowers:</p>
<p>"Our feet become gentle in the flowers.</p>
<p>The newest happiness is hidden in those mountains.</p>
<p>Sometimes</p>
<p>A scent of lilac, a cluster of blooming flowers,</p>
<p>Floats around us, and beehives,</p>
<p>Become fragrant because of the white flowers."</p>
<p>Look how moved he was when he saw the beautiful opium poppy.</p>
<p>"A breeze slips through the dancing opium poppies,</p>
<p>Caressing my soul and creating before my eyes</p>
<p>A hallucination of color,"</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tennyson had a special feeling for the beauty of flowers. Beauty only stirred his inner feelings, not the external ones:</p>
<p>"The soul of the rose enters my blood,"</p>
<p>"The scent of lilac, hidden in the grass,</p>
<p>Pours into my empty soul and body."</p>
<p>"Is everything as clear and white as my flower?"</p>
<p>Another characteristic of Tennyson is that he humanized flowers, for example:</p>
<p>"The flowers, in sweet pain,</p>
<p>Raise their eyes above the water bubbles,</p>
<p>Like our Queen."</p>
<p>If we know that Tennyson was a student of Keats, then it is not surprising that they both had similar interests in flowers. The beauty of flowers made Keats think of "beauty is truth, truth is beauty"; but it made Tennyson think of his lover, his hometown, and his happy youth. The former had a passionate enthusiasm for beauty; the latter had a reflective contemplation of beauty. Obviously, Tennyson was more practical than Keats. From this point of view, the impact of the beauty of the flowers was different for the two poets.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy point is that these two poets had different attitudes towards different flowers. The flowers they both loved were roses, lilies, lilacs, daisies, and primroses. The symbols of these flowers are: roses symbolize love and happiness; lilies symbolize purity; lilacs symbolize tranquility; daisies and primroses symbolize lightness. They believed that roses were the most precious of all flowers because roses are the symbol of love.</p>
<p>Studying Keats's and Tennyson's interest in and handling of flowers is, in my opinion, not without value. They both deeply loved flowers and could be said to be happy upon seeing them; however, their perceptions of flowers differed slightly. This, I think, must be due to different personality types. Keats was a purely Romantic individual, while Tennyson was from the Victorian era; therefore, they naturally looked at flowers with different eyes.</p>
<p>Their love of flowers gave their poems beautiful outlines, and when reading their poems, we learn to love and appreciate flowers with new eyes. (Translated from "British Digest" Issue 1)</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>— Signac</p>
<p>Signac (Paul Signac, 1862) was also a founder of Neo-Impressionism (i.e., Pointillism). His style was even bolder than Seurat's, and he was not as restrained by formal beauty or concerned with the uniformity of brushstrokes as Seurat was. His brushwork, composition, and colors were simpler and more uninhibited. He rarely overlapped brushstrokes, preferring to leave gaps (the original color of the canvas) between them, giving the impression of a "mosaic" on a medieval church wall. His landscapes had a distinct oriental flavor. He had a great influence on later generations, such as the Post-Impressionist Gauguin, who were inspired by him. This landscape can be considered a representative work. (Lion)</p>
<h3>On Wang Ge YI</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Recalling twenty years ago, in the realm of calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy, one figure stood tall, admired and collected by connoisseurs as a precious treasure, revered as a model by scholars – Wu Changshuo of Anji. Changshuo's calligraphy and painting benefited from his expertise in epigraphy, while his epigraphy, in turn, was enhanced by his calligraphy and painting. Through fusion and transformation, he achieved a grand and expansive style. Ni Yunlin once praised Wang Huanghe, saying: "Shuming's brushstrokes can lift a tripod; there has been no such talent in five hundred years." With Changshuo's spirit, he could more than easily lift a tripod, truly unmatched in the three hundred years of the late Qing dynasty.</p>
<p>At the time, scholars across the country were captivated by Changshuo's fame, believing that bold strokes and vibrant colors were all it took to grasp Changshuo's essence. Thus, they mixed pigments and applied colors, vying to imitate him, creating a surge of activity that flourished for a time. This led to a negative impression of Changshuo's paintings, dismissed as the Shanghai School, ultimately detracting from Changshuo's reputation. Changshuo himself was distressed by the blind imitation of scholars. However, there were indeed those who studied Changshuo and captured his spirit, such as Chen Shizeng in the north and Wang Ge YI in the south. (Qi Baishi also rose to prominence by studying Changshuo, but he was rather reluctant to admit it.)</p>
<p>Shizeng possessed excellent talent and learning, but unfortunately passed away before the age of fifty. As for Ge YI, he had a strong memory and diligently studied, deeply rooted in the tradition, earning him the reputation of being Changshuo's most accomplished disciple. He excelled in poetry, prose, epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. His calligraphy and painting were grounded in his poetry, prose, and epigraphy, resulting in a style that was profound and unadorned, infused with elegance and scholarly refinement within a bold and vigorous framework, extremely rich in simplicity and breadth. His prose drew inspiration from the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "Book of Han," while also drawing from the styles of Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu. His poetry encompassed the styles of Li Bai, Du Fu, Su Shi, and Huang Tingjian, truly a versatile talent in the contemporary art world.</p>
<p>Ge YI also had a penchant for collecting, especially works by the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, Zhao Zhiqian, and Ren Bonian. Changshuo's style, in fact, evolved from Zhao and Ren, tracing back to the source. Ge YI's love for Zhao and Ren was akin to studying Wang Meng while tracing back to Dong Qichang. Over the past twenty years, Ge YI has diligently adhered to this path, focusing wholeheartedly, becoming more diligent over time, and the more diligent he became, the greater his success. Ge, seeing the recent trend in the art world to gradually neglect Changshuo's school and emphasize the Song style, felt a responsibility to promote and carry forward its brilliance. Therefore, starting on April 23rd, he held a week-long exhibition of his works at the Ningbo Association, allowing the public to witness firsthand the wonders of Chinese calligraphy and painting art – to the most refined and subtle, and also to the most extensive and encompassing. In recent years, despite the various Southern Wang and Northern Li, Xu and Huang, different styles, complex systems, and diverse schools, the spirit remains consistent, with a unified essence. Brushstrokes and artistic conception, though different paths, converge on the same goal, expressing emotions and depicting scenes, all sufficient to demonstrate the unique style of our nation. This exhibition will also allow the world to know that Changshuo's school has a long history, with its bold, vigorous, profound style, inherently worthy of being passed down.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 403</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Ha, you need to think about the kind of education you've received since you were a child, the kind of influence you've been exposed to—"knowing only yourself," "hubris born of ignorance"; and besides, it's just "obedience"; those who aren't in "our" group are supposedly not supposed to exist; not "obeying" is equal to committing a crime?..." Shouyi was being so blunt, pointing out Tsurumi's misguided prejudices.</p>
<p>Tsurumi put his hands behind his back and walked back and forth in the room twice, then suddenly stopped and looked at Shouyi; "Big brother, what you say is absolutely correct, it's strange that I never had this logic before? I always wished to gather all the talents under one command, to proceed together—of course, I don't necessarily have to be the commander—..."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute?" Shouyi interrupted Tsurumi, "You have to understand that this method, if done wrong, has extreme danger—..."</p>
<p>"I understand!" Tsurumi didn't let Shouyi elaborate. "Under a common big goal, each group is free to act. When necessary, as long as the opinions are consistent, one notice, everyone joins forces and advances together, heading towards the same point... right?"</p>
<p>"But, where is the danger?" Shouyi questioned Tsurumi.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's fearing that small groups will 'stick to old ways,' expressing uniqueness, competing with each other, making opinions, fighting for rights, etc., etc.…"</p>
<p>"No!" Shouyi waved his hand, stopping Tsurumi, "The problems you mentioned are beyond the scope of 'comrades dividing labor and cooperating,' of course, they are also correct. What I mean is that any group qualified to be a liaison shouldn't have these problems. As for the 'danger' I mentioned, it's technical: for example, today, if not for the convenience of technical equipment, I would probably have already gone to Nanjing. The matter there is also very urgent. Now, from consulting various reports, I know that the urgency and importance here are no less than Nanjing, and solving it here is equivalent to solving the problem in Nanjing, so everyone in our village who was preparing to participate in the Nanjing action has stopped proceeding, waiting for my message..."</p>
<p>"So you were willing to rush here so early?" Tsurumi's expression had a bit of a sour tinge.</p>
<p>"It was also to meet you, ever since Zhengyan mentioned your various actions." Shouyi expressed his sincerity; using this natural alkaline sincerity, he neutralized the inexplicable sourness in Tsurumi.</p>
<p>These two young men talked with passion and enthusiasm, almost forgetting the urgent topic at hand. However, without this passionate conversation, who knows how many years and months it would take to connect with each other again, going in all directions.</p>
<p>"I have a curious question I'd like to ask you," Tsurumi still didn't want to mention the current urgent issue.</p>
<p>"What question?"</p>
<p>"Wait," Tsurumi thought of something else again; "Let me first explain the 'technical' problem you just mentioned."</p>
<p>"Very good."</p>
<p>"The most important thing in liaison technology is, of course, well-informed news. With well-informed news, all barriers can be eliminated, and misunderstandings can be eradicated. At the same time, if there is a request from each other, there is no need for a medium to convey it, it can be directly transmitted..."</p>
<p>"This is a very good way." Shouyi paid attention to Tsurumi's following words.</p>
<h3>Art and Literary Circles</h3>

The Zhejiang Daily's supplement "Zhejiang Women" is edited by Mo Luo's wife, Lin Mian, and "Jiang Feng" is edited by Min Zi, whose original name was Min Yuru.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>National Essence and Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>— Chang Chu</p>
<p>A certain newspaper reported that some antique magnates are collecting historical relics from China's millennia of history in Beijing and Shanghai, transporting them to the United States for sale in order to obtain US dollar foreign exchange. It also said that people in the city who care about cultural relics have contacted the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee and the Customs to find ways to prevent important Chinese cultural relics from falling into foreign hands. After reading this news, several friends couldn't help but shake their heads and sigh. But one person said:</p>
<p>"Chu has its own gains. Now it's one family under heaven. What the people of the world lose, the people of the world gain. What's there to regret?"</p>
<p>Another person said:</p>
<p>"This is ultimately our national essence, the legacy passed down from our ancestors for thousands of years. How can we sell it to foreigners?"</p>
<p>"The selling of national essence isn't something that just happened today, nor is it just one person doing it. Don't you know that even humor masters are selling it?"</p>
<p>"Humor masters are only promoting national essence, not selling it. Promotion only ends when the talent of Jiang Yan is exhausted and he switches to machine manufacturing. Selling, on the other hand, ends when one is bankrupt and has nothing left to sell."</p>
<p>"I desire national essence, and I also desire foreign exchange. If I can't have both, I will abandon national essence and take foreign exchange."</p>
<p>"You are truly a profit-seeking creature!" A lady opened her mouth to scold.</p>
<p>"Without foreign exchange, how can you have American lipstick and perfume, how can you have RCA portable radios running around Hangzhou in the spring?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of Hangzhou, really, if you didn't have that radio to listen to at any time, you'd be bored to death?"</p>
<p>"I remember what bothered you the most was when you were looking at antiques in the museum."</p>
<p>"Antiques naturally cannot compare to mountains and rivers."</p>
<p>"How can antiques compare to foreign exchange?"</p>
<p>"Foreigners want antiques, we want foreign exchange. Exchanging something for nothing, everyone is happy. Isn't that a great thing?"</p>
<p>Arriving here, another gentleman read the newspaper. He said that Huo Baoshu, Director of the Administrative Headquarters, returned from inspecting the Yellow River flood area. He said that the area was barren for thousands of miles, with no sign of human habitation, and the yellow sand was several feet deep, almost turning into a new desert. He said:</p>
<p>"If you ask the old people who have flowed out of that area, whether we want national essence or foreign exchange, that would be the real answer!"</p>
<p>Is that so? The people present started arguing noisily again.</p>
<h3>China—A Mystery of the World?</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>Excerpt from a news report:</p>
<p>(New York, Central News Agency, 1st) The associate editor of the Kansas Star returned from the East. He recently broadcasted a special essay on China. He said at the beginning: "China is still the world's greatest mystery. There are extremely conflicting forces working together in China. The apparent chaos and crisis of collapse are all confusing."</p>
<p>In fact, this is just a rehash of old ideas. A long time ago, a foreign writer, after discovering the mystery of China, went back and told others: China encompasses everything, from unicycles, rickshaws, sedan chairs, horse-drawn carriages, automobiles, to trains. His meaning, of course, was not just limited to vehicles. China has both a new side and a backward side to anything. Therefore, there are modern girls in nylon high heels, and there are also their mothers with three-inch golden lotuses. There are ground-breaking ceremonies presided over by young ladies and young mistresses, and there are also the Miao people's cannibalistic rituals. There is the latest translated "World War of the End of the World" by Leonard Engel, and there is also Liu Bowen's "Tui Bei Tu." There are newly arrived copies of the brilliantly colored "Water Lily," but there are also the countryside's sheepskin shadow puppets. All of these are facts. And what do these facts illustrate? It is said that China is still in the process of change, in the midst of the struggle between the old and the new. The new is not necessarily all good, and the old is not necessarily all bad; the end result of the struggle is to achieve the highest degree of "good."</p>
<p>China's progress is based on the struggle between the new and the old. "Mysterious China," "enigmatic China," "Chinese affairs, not necessarily maybe is definitely so," etc., are just the impressions of China in the eyes of some foreigners. John Gunther, known for uncovering international "insider" information, can only have this view of China, so what about the associate editor of the Kansas Star who only took a stroll in some areas of China?</p>
<p>However, when broken down, this so-called mystery is actually not difficult to crack. The reason why China is "not easy to understand," as the saying goes, is because the place is too big, the population is too large, the history is too long, and the writing is too deep. And especially important is that this China, with a history of three thousand years, is in the midst of revolutionary transformation.</p>
<p>China's all-encompassing and all-encompassing nature illustrates the messiness of this land. And precisely because it is too messy, the entire Chinese society is still in the process of revolutionary transformation, still in the process of refinement. To understand China, spatial sightseeing is necessary, and studying history, which records the traces of time, is especially necessary. Some say that China is a victim of square characters; some say that China is the epitome of the philosophy of inertia, perfunctoriness, and carelessness; and some say that China is burdened by metaphysics and has become a paradise for metaphysical ghosts. These words all have merit, and they all only see one side of the truth.</p>
<p>What is worth worrying about is not China's "messiness," but the evolutionary process of mountain people.</p>
<p>A fierce man, when surrounded by Qing guests, immediately becomes an animal specimen in a cage; revolutionary patriots, having tasted a little sweetness, immediately send telegrams, draft declarations, and become clowns on the stage of life. True warriors are rare. Therefore, young people are ahead of their time, middle-aged people follow the times, and old people drag the times, which becomes the "evolutionary process" of most people.</p>
<p>This is sad. If this situation does not change, China's "mystery" will also become a symbol of its tragedy.</p>
<h3>Too Many Names</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>University girl A: Why didn't you pay attention to what name the professor called when he was calling roll?</p>
<p>University girl B: I did pay attention, but he answered to four people's names.</p>
<h3>Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert in "Since You Went Away"</h3>
<h3>Anecdotes about Fu Ni</h3>
<p>— Lu Shi</p>
<p>There was a certain gentleman in Hangzhou who had poetic and drinking friendships with Fu Ni before the war (Fu was fond of poetry and drinking). When Fu betrayed and became the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, the gentleman severed all communication. Later, Fu concurrently served as the puppet director of the Taihu Southeast Region Qingxiang Office, and established the puppet office in Jiaxing. He suddenly found that the gentleman was hiding in a Hangzhou village, and sent a letter inviting him. The gentleman replied: "Upon receiving your letter, I know that you miss an old friend. Private feelings are touching, but public righteousness is difficult to speak of. The world is chaotic and troublesome, and my poetic inspiration has been lost for a long time. I heard that you are in Yanyu Duzitou, setting up wine for a high gathering, facing the stream and wielding spears, which cannot be without poetry. Therefore, I recorded a song of Wu Meicun, 'Yuanyang Lake Melody,' to express my meaning." The concluding sentence of the Yuanyang Lake Melody is: "The hardships of the world are all relics of the past, and it is heartbreaking year after year. When hearing the flute, stop comparing yourself to Shi Jilun, and when holding the cup, just imitate Jiang Pengze. Don't you see the white waves soaring to the sky and a leaf in danger? Pulling in the fishing rod is still afraid of turning the boat too late. Life is full of endless hardships, so leave it to the fisherman to know!" It meant to satirize his early withdrawal. Fu was stunned and unhappy, but he hesitated and looked around, unable to extricate himself, and eventually fell into great shame, leaving shame for a hundred generations. How sad!</p>
<h3>"Can't Walk" Theory</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>With the increase in vehicles and the narrowness of roads, no matter if you invite American experts to study the matter or issue notices to stop the issuance of licenses for rickshaws and "tiger cars," the existing roads cannot accommodate the existing vehicles. Therefore, the previous few foreign methods and today's adoption of lane management have not reduced the phenomenon of congestion. Because of the congestion, vehicle accidents have also increased dramatically. Walking on the streets gives one a real sense of "the road is like a tiger's mouth." The recent incident of a Texaco oil truck running over a Jiaotong University student stems from this. Naturally, the driver's claim of brake failure and high-speed driving are also major causes of the accident. However, it is quite strange to say that 90% of vehicle accidents are due to pedestrians not knowing how to walk.</p>
<p>Foreigners have many criticisms of Chinese people, but criticizing Chinese people for not even knowing how to walk is quite novel. It seems that it is also common for people to drive jeeps onto sidewalks while drunk. Is it also justifiable to say that pedestrians are hitting cars and label them as suicidal? Fortunately, the driver is still honest and admitted that the car had brake problems. Otherwise, the Jiaotong University student Jia Zilian who was run over would have been deemed as simply not knowing how to walk.</p>
<p>In fact, instead of saying that they don't know how to walk, it's better to ask why Chinese people can't have one car per four people on average like Americans. In our case, we are the best at walking. In a city where transportation infrastructure has not met the requirements, every pedestrian walking on the road has not been run over, which shows that Chinese people are indeed capable of walking. It's just that they don't have the innate strength to collide with trucks that have high speeds and bad brakes.</p>
<p>In order to prevent future incidents, I would like to suggest to Texaco Oil Company that they might as well request the relevant authorities to treat all Texaco Oil Company vehicles as fire trucks and ambulances. In this way, not only will there be no criminal liability, but even the 50 million funeral expenses can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Introducing "Spring Chamber Tears"</h3>
<p>— Ma Boling</p>
<p>"Spring Chamber Tears," like "Amorous Seeds" and "Broken Heart," extends from the love between men and women to the love of parents for their children. I said that the latter part of "Broken Heart" is more tearful than "Amorous Seeds." Now, the latter part of "Spring Chamber Tears" is even more desolate than "Broken Heart." "Since You Departed" and "Nation Above All" are unsatisfactory, so I cherish the tragic element of "Spring Chamber Tears." It has been a long time since I have seen such a tragedy. Watching the heavy rain and fluttering snowflakes in the play, many people cried.</p>
<p>The director, Mervyn LeRoy, directed romantic works by Ramon Novarro in his early years and became famous during the war with "When the Moon Sets, Crows Caw, and Frost Fills the Sky." The most impressive original work in our memory is "Anthony Adverse." Since then, from "Random Harvest" and "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" to this "Spring Chamber Tears," the increase in grandeur is evident. The power of the technique and the manipulation of the atmosphere are all noteworthy achievements, especially the handling from the death of the male protagonist to the end, which is deeply penetrating. As for the actors, Orson Welles's composure is fully displayed, and Claudette Colbert once again teaches us to firmly believe that she is the only Hollywood actress capable of resisting Ingrid Bergman; two child stars should be specially recommended, one is seventeen-year-old Dean Stockwell, who plays the son, and the other is six-year-old Natalie Wood, who plays the Austrian adopted daughter. Her sudden cry at the end is heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"I know there are not enough cars for so many people. But I already promised Mrs. Hu yesterday, Lao Zhu, you can't let me break my promise!" Finally, she thought of the only way a favored woman can deal with an old man—coquetry. So she sat on the bed as if she were strangely angry, pouting her mouth and nagging, "Didn't you say you would listen to me? You won't even agree to such a small matter, what else can I ask of you? I don't care, you have to find a way to help Mrs. Hu...!"</p>
<p>By the end, she really looked like she was about to cry. Old Zhu had never expected that Jin Aili, who had always been as docile as a lamb, would suddenly cause him trouble. But he also knew that Jin Aili had been living with Mrs. Hu in Xu Shaoming's house for the past few days, and they got along very well. Jin Aili had repeatedly mentioned Mrs. Hu and her two children to him, so he absolutely did not suspect that this was for Lao Zhu's sake.</p>
<p>"Help me, Commander!" Zhu Zhaonian coldly saw that Old Zhu's face had gradually revealed a hesitant look, and knew that things had turned around, so he quickly helped with words. "I, Zhu Zhaonian, understand this matter best. If you can find a way for them when there is no way, I will be even more grateful than if you were helping myself!"</p>
<p>Old Zhu hesitated for another minute or two, and several beads of sweat appeared on his red nose.</p>
<p>"Well, then like this:" he said stammeringly, somewhat undecided. "One adult and two children, my small chartered car really can't fit, at most one can ride. The rest..."</p>
<p>"What about the rest?" Zhu Zhaonian did not dare to relax at all. His gaze was fixed on the other person's pupils.</p>
<p>But it was useless. Old Zhu's heart had been sealed off by the desire for power and profit as early as thirty or forty years ago. He could occasionally help someone once without any compensation, but if it exceeded this limit, he would never agree, even if it meant death.</p>
<p>"The rest we'll think about in a day or two." He said very firmly, but still had a strange, endearing fake smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Are we leaving today then?" Jin Aili, as disappointed as Lao Zhu, mustered up her courage and added this sentence.</p>
<p>Old Zhu really felt a little annoyed at his new favorite's lack of tact today.</p>
<p>"What's the problem?" He glared at Jin Aili secretly. "Even if I leave, there are still people in the company here, and Mr. Zhu can contact them at any time. No problem! No problem!" He said again with a kind smile, meaning that Lao Zhu should retreat in the face of difficulty. (Four) (One)</p>
