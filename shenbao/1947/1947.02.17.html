<h3>主席發表談話　當前經濟困難為一時脫節　盼全民認清需要共謀建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕國防最高委會，十六日晨通過經濟緊急措施方案，蔣主席對此特發表談話，全文如次：</p>
<p>我國自經八年長期抗戰，全國經濟遭受敵人之壓榨與破壞，情形嚴重，自無待言，故勝利以後，政府即以復員建設為最要之工作。然復員建設之　行，必先求得國內之和平統一，因之，戰後第一措施為政治協商之舉行，以求和平統一之實現，我友邦美國以公正之態度，努力　處，時逾一年，和平雖時露曙光，而以共黨堅執成見，不履行整　方案，不參加國民大會，以致政府用政治方法解決政治問題之方針無由實現，而和平談判終告停頓，共黨之蓄意擾亂社會　序及實施破壞國家統一，自應負其責任，亦已為我國人所明悉。惟共黨雖拒不參加國民大會與國民政府，而政府以職責所在，仍努力進行民主政治之實施，最近國民政府即可改組成　，今後要務，在集合我全國賢達，以決定破策，並依照憲法及其實施準備民　之規定，實施選舉，完成黨政。在國民政　　　　及各院部會中，各黨所推選之委　　　，　將予以規定，并延犢　社會人士參　以加強政府之基礎。</p>
<p>共黨擾亂破壞和平　造成當前經濟困難</p>
<p>我國常前之問題，非為政黨問題，而實為民主政治之發展問題，此為建國必循之途徑，亦為我國之生存所關，余切望全國同胞均能竭憲忠誠，與國家同其休戚，萬衆一心，以挽救我國當前之困難，而奠立建國之基礎。</p>
<p>現在我國經濟狀况，己雇非常嚴軍之時，蓋繼八年抗戰之消耗與日寇侵略之破壞以後，而共黨又復　復員時期，肆其騷擾，與日俱增，即在調處談判期間，仍不斷用武力以擴張其地　，亦從未停化軍事行動。華北及朿九省各地，　共黨　　竄踞之地區更廣，一經為所佔據，即自立政權。發行紙幣，封鎖經濟，阻止食種物資運入。我政府所管轄各地，其破壞鐵路及交通路綫，以及工議事業，較之日　侵佔時　，更為澈底，茲舉數　言之：</p>
<p>我國煤藏豐富，　應國內　需，本屬無　缺乏，因被共黨阻碍交通，破壞礦塲，以致去年我各地工　　　之　，不能中國產充分供應，而下得不由外國輸入。戰前我國棉花，烟葉盡可自給，而去年北方各省迭遭兵燹，以致生產减少，棉菸工廠所需原料，進口達美金二萬萬元之鉅，我國以農立國，而現時進口物資，乃以農產品為大宗，至可痛心。</p>
<p>由上所述，吾人必能深明當前經濟之困難，買由於八年來抗戰中所受之毀壞，以及一年來共黨擾亂國家，破壞和平之所致。</p>
<p>解救國民經濟危機　決定十項緊急措施</p>
<p>在過去一年內，政府處理外匯，極為寬大，同時，對戰時管制政策分別廢除，良以戰後國內工商各業物資缺乏，急待充實，故必須予工商各業以自由發展之機會，惟國內經濟情况旣因共產黨之擾亂，國家與和平統一之遭受障碍，而日見嚴重，為適應當前環境，解救國民經濟危機，政府對於經濟政策，必須全盤重加撿討，已決定作下列各項之緊急措施：（一）政府所有外匯以及黃金之支用，應予撙節，以備購買工業原料及機器之需，俾國內生產及交通事業得以繼續推進，日用必需之重要物資，亦得以繼續補充，其結購之滙率，應比照國內外貨幣購買力予以適合之規定，期使不再波動，故於本月十七日起，將滙率改定為每天元以國幣一萬二千結滙。此次新訂匯率，雖較以前所訂者為高，但衡之國內物價水準，並未超過。（二）寨止黃金在市塲上之買賣，並禁止外國幣券之流通與買賣，以遏止投機之風。同時，由中央銀行充分供給正當合法之外匯。（三）政府應盡量解除農工生產所受高利之壓迫，以貸款或其他方式，救濟農業·工業，而扶助其發展。（四）政府支出應極度縮减，本年度預算內，凡不必要之新建設，均予展緩。五我國因尙未普遍施用近代會計制度，故所得稅與各項直接稅之徵收，未克顯著成效，現在應不求計算之精密，反致曠日持久，而應採迅捷有效之徵收方法，如因此而或使個人負祖，容有加重之處，則為一致擁護政府，以達到安定經濟起見，凡我同胞，均應確認此實為增加國家收入，平衡國家收支應取之途徑，而一致予以遵行。（六）各項公用事業，如政府繼續貼補，則預算無法維持，故此後應酌予合理增加。（七）勞工工資衡以戰前物價，其實在所得已增漲數倍，較公教人員及軍人之待遇優厚甚多，政府並將以其外匯供給工廠購買原料物資之用，俾使勞工得以繼續工作，而無虞失業，政府無意將勞工應得之合理報酬加以削减，但亦希望勞工同胞以公衆一般的福利為前題，並與服務於社會與國家其他部份之人士一致表示愛國精神，刻苦動勞，維持生產，以後提高工資，應即確定最高限度，不得漫無限制，妨及產業界之生存與發展。（八）各項國營事業，其不屬於重工業之範圍者，均應予以標售或發行股票，公開出售。（九）對於民生日用主要物品，如米·麪，布疋·燃煤·食油等極少數之種類，即予以從嚴管制，凡違反管制法令，從事投機囤積等非法行為者，從嚴懲處。（十）在抗戰期中新成立之商業銀行，為數甚多，其中頗有從事於投機等行為者，應由財政部嚴予監督調查，依法懲處。</p>
<p>復員建設竭力進行　棉花生產可望自給</p>
<p>總之，年餘以來，共黨雖盡其破壞經濟之能事，而我政府對於各項復員建設，仍在不辭艱苦，竭力進行，亦有顯著之進步，足以告慰國人。如以交通言之，去年年初，在我政府管制下之鐵路，為七千八百四十五公里，雖頻受共黨之襲擊破壞，現今鐵路之可通運輸者，已達一萬一千八百八十七公里，即增加里數達百分之五十。就輸船言之，在抗戰前，除外國商輸外，吾國輸船共有五十七萬噸，戰事結束之時，祗餘三十一萬四千八百三十五噸，最近則已達六十九萬二千零七十一噸。就生產方面言之，去年生產棉紗九十六萬包，鋼鐵入千噸，電力一百十七萬一千一百五十五瓩，水泥三十萬噸，煤一千三百萬噸。本年估計可生產棉紗二百三十七萬九千包，鋼鐵二十萬噸，電力一百六十三萬八千五百瓩，水泥九十萬噸，煤二千三百萬噸。上述生產數額，較之工業國家自屬微小，惟以去年之種種困難阻礙，尙能有此收獲亦良為不易。再就農業言之，本年賴國外轍入之棉花及烟葉，計占需要數量百分之七七五，預計在本年收穫期後，我國可能自行供給棉花達百分之七十五，如再能加緊努力，擴大生產，即不難達到悉數自給自足之希望。</p>
<p>對於輸出貿易，亦已積極推進，棉紗，紗布，大豆·蛋類，茶葉，礦物及油類等貨物，已向國外輸出。又台灣一省係為產糖，茶葉，樟腦及米之地區，在被日寇侵佔時期，每年出超可達美金二億五千萬元，現此富饒之區亦旣收復，此後攝出貿易必可增加。</p>
<p>我國自力更生措施　盼望友邦同情了解</p>
<p>最後欲為吾同胞陳述者，當前經濟之困難固多，但並無足以恐懼之理由，吾國現時經濟上之困難，其原因均為一時的脫節，且經濟之變態，亦僅限於若干之都市，實則農業，工業之基本因素原屬健全，祗須我全國各界同胞均能於其工作崗位上加以決心努力，互助合作，密切配合，必能解除目前之危難。吾人當同憶抗戰期間亦曾以同樣之決心與努力，克復日寇侵略所加於吾國空前未有更為嚴重之危難，今後誠能秉此堅苦精神，認清國家之需要，善　國民之義務，一心一德·向建國之途徑而邁進，必能達到民主政治及恢復我國經濟之正常狀態，此為政府職責之所在，亦為國家光明前途之所賴。余尤　各友邦認識我國恢復經濟安定自力更生之措施，旨在達到繁榮世界貿易及努力於世界和平之貢獻，予以同情及了解也。</p>

<h3>辦法拿出來了</h3>
<p>經濟上的局勢太混亂，各方面切盼政府拿出如何解決的辦法來。昨日國防最高委員會中，已將經濟緊急措置辦法通過，主席並加以剴切說明，其要點如下：</p>
<p>第一，平衡預算事項，為甲，不迫切需要之支出均緩發，乙，整頓稅收，丙，加緊標售敵偽產業及剩餘物資，丁，國營生產事業，以標售或發行股票方式，讓與民營。</p>
<p>第二，平抑金潮辦法，為甲，禁止黃金買賣，乙，禁止外幣流通，丙，採用戰時條例，管制物價，丁，出口補助與進口附加的辦法取消，美鈔官價提高至一萬二千元。</p>
<p>上項方案，已將財政，捐稅，黃金，美鈔，物價，匯價，及國營事業等統通包括在內，而最高工資的限度，和生產貸款的維持，也都有原則上的決定。復員以來，經濟上的措施，無疑地要算這一决最為重要，就大體說來，也算這一次最愜民望。因為（一）汰除浮費，（二）移轉國營事業，（三）禁止黃金買賣，（四）禁止外幣流通，這幾項已成輿論一致的要求，而正式調整外匯和實施物價管制，也有不少人在倡導着。所以昨日議決的許多辦法，其性質雖很重要，却無一項是出人意料的新提義。我們所要特別指出的，有下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）出口補助與進口附加辦法的取消，這事極為正當。因為此項辦法，名義上雖非調整外匯，實際上却是提高匯率，徒然留下幾個破綻，如實行津貼，使友邦不愜意，此其一，僑匯無法招徠，坐看牠依蓓橫溢到他處去，此其二，進口照貨價附加百分之五十，並非是進口稅照加百分之五十，在一般洋商的心理上，遠不如調整外匯來得順眼，此其三。所以此次毅然決然，及時改正，與其說是失之輕率，母寗說是正當的辦法。</p>
<p>（二）採用戰時條例，管制物價，籍以取締囤積與投機，此舉在理論上，自然無可非議。而且此現行的所謂經濟偵察網，在法理上與手續上要高明得多。不過戰時管制的成績，其實不能謂為成功。無論公約方面，或私的方面，所有痛苦的經騐，大都尙能回味。所以勝利之初，便將各項管制辦法，一概取消，這其中，自有不得不然的緣故。現在雖以物價在漲，市面混亂，不得不重新走上這一條老路，但是人事，辦法，種類，和方針這幾方面，我們希望在痛苦的經騐中，能夠獲得此較完善的途徑，不單以戰時條例為滿足。主席已聲明：民生日用主要物品，如米，麵，布疋，燃煤，食油等極少數之種類，予以從嚴管制。可見此次並非全面管制，亦可見政府於採行管制之中，仍寓有十分審愼之意。我們切望辦理機關善體此意，慎重將事。勿使水深火熱的商民，更加上無數不必要的麻煩與痛苦。</p>
<p>（三）裁减不必要的支出，以平衡預算，這好像是一句例行的官話，其實却是目前最切要的措置。大家知道：經濟上的種種浮動現象，直接間接，與通貨膨脹均有關係。而通貨之所以膨脹，不外入不敷出，不得不賴發鈔以為彌補的手段。所以一切浮濫的支出，如果能大刀闊斧，一概杜絕，則收支自可漸平，新鈔自可止發，游資自可漸减，物價自可穩定，工資不至再加，利率亦將回平，而奸商的囤積和投機，亦將無從大施其技。所成為問題的，就是財政太不統一，無論中央與地方，悉憑各機關，本其主觀的見解，振振有詞，強求濫索，以至一切費用，在他們多成為必要。譬如本市預算，到如今，還無從編成，還在籌議審查之中，這就是一切費用，在主管的都認為必要之故。所以不迫切需要的支出，要使其緩發，减發，則統籌全局的長官，必須下大決心，把此類不迫切需要的機關和事業先行停罷，方才可以收效。</p>
<p>最後，我們更要向一般商民說幾句話：政府的辦法，是已經拿出來了。這些辦法，要使牠確實奏效，一方面，固要奉行的機關先有信心，恪恭將事，妥為辦理，務求貫澈方案，一方面，却也要一切有關的人眞誠合作，不加以有形與無形的搗亂與破壞。尤其是（一）管制物價，民衆不肯合作，單靠憲警的力量去偵察，去制裁，那是不會得十分圓滿的。（二）旬日前，實行出口補助，其目的，自然在促進輸出。無奈一般囤商盲目拉抬，在短短的幾日內，把貨價抬高到一倍以上，以至政府補助的效用完全抵銷。此次調整匯價，定為美鈔一萬一千對一，出口匯率，又等於增高一倍，（照三三五〇計算，則等於提高三倍）。假如照此成本，善為運用，則出口貨的銷路，似乎不難活動。希望大家放大眼光，遵照　主席所示：萬衆一心，以挽救我國當前之困難。</p>

<h3>泛美防務委員會建議　西半球實行聯防　軍事訓練與配備標準化　繼美加軍事協定之後又一重要計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕泛美防務委員會頃向美洲各共和國建議，使武器配備及西半球陸海空軍之訓練趨於標準化，並主張設立軍事委員會，促進西半球防務更密切少合作。利用前哨基地之海空軍，採用閃電長程防衛原則，並交換陸海空軍官佐。按泛美防務委員會之委員，均爲美洲廿一國之陸海空軍代表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕泛美防務委會今日宣布計劃，規定美洲標準化之陸海空軍當迅速擊退西半球的任何攻擊者。配備軍火與訓練之標準化，乃該計劃之要點，例如巴西之砲隊可開放美國之砲彈，或同一重要零件可以裝在十餘國家之巡邏轟炸機上，戰略亦將趨於一致。其計劃中要求拉丁美洲各國軍隊，改爲美國式配備，辦法與上星期宣布之美加聯防協定相同。按美加宣布已商定戰時軍事合作及交換戰後情報之計劃，英政府亦已表示該國將來擬將防　軍備，遵循美國所採用之路綫。</p>
<h3>美積極開發北極區</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕莫斯科曾指斥美國企圖將北極區變成「帝國主義陰謀之據點」。美高級軍事當局亦並不稍隱其對北極區之關切。然此間外交與軍事官員今日一再强調稱，美國對北極區之關切，決非侵略性者。大部份官員均同意空軍司令史巴資之見解，即「各工業化國家均在美飛機航程之內，反之，美國同時亦在他國航程之內，故事實上美國之上空乃絕對開放者」故軍事領袖等乃極力主張在北極區建立氣象站與瞭望哨。根據最近宣佈之美加防禦協定，兩國應交換一切關於共同防票上之情報，包括北極區以及軍隊中新式配備與給養之情報。</p>
<h3>集體安全　尙難實現　美陸長力主保持軍力</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社費城十五日電〕美陸長柏德遜頃在鄧浦爾大學發表演說稱：世人對於一九四七年雖均打如意算盤，認爲可以高枕無憂，但由世界和平組織維持之集體安全仍不存在，此乃無可掩飾之事實。吾國之安全，仍有賴吾人之資源，吾人現仍處在一個唯以權力是賴之此界。美國之根本問題，乃在取得安定與永久和平，余堅信吾人防止新戰爭浩刦之最佳保證，厥爲維特軍力。美國在新戰爭中，即使獲勝，但美國之經濟組織，仍可能因而耐潰，良以戰爭所加諸全國之財政負担至重故也。關於裁軍問題，有一點必須注意，即德日兩國一日有恢復其侵略習慣之機會，吾人即一日不能考慮裁軍問題。吾人在釐定任何裁軍計劃時，必須注意二點，即（一）裁軍計劃，必須繼以一項對於管制制度之明確協定，保證是項協定不被違反。（二）任何裁軍計劃凡屬旨在避免戰爭者，應不僅禁止「大規模破壞之武器」，且亦應限制軍隊之力量，包括警察在內，因警察能迅即改編成軍隊故也。吾人對於聯合國機構及裁减軍備，固應全力為其後盾，但際此戰事甫經結束，和平尙未降臨之朦朧時期，世人仍以各國之軍力，權衡其所發言論之重輕，故吾人必須保持本身之安全仍屬事實，吾人將堅持保留相當軍力之政策。</p>
<h3>對法捷談判　英政界觀感</h3>
<p>認法政策恢復舊作風</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕此間政界人士對昨日巴黎宣布法國與捷克即將開始談判，以修訂兩國間之條約，使符近代局勢之消息，深感興趣。查法國與英國以及法國與捷克間關於德國問題意見均不相同，法國與英談判盟約之際，復宣布欲輿捷克談判，可見法國可能在與該兩國之談判中，提出德國問題。同時在內政方面，亦具相當作用。法國內若干人士前此認英法締盟，爲法國親英表示而不滿者，今見決國與東歐亦將開始，其疑懼心理當可稍减。法國今後之外交政策，似將恢復被解放前後之作風，以本身作爲東西間之橋梁。英國之政策，固爲在不損各大盟國間責任之範圍內，訂立多方面之同盟關係，預料對法捷談判當表歡迎。</p>

<h3>應付國內煤荒危機　英王有提前返國說　關於此事史末資並無所聞</h3>
<p>〔聯合社開浦鎭十五日電〕史末資元帥今日向聯合社記者宣稱：外傳英王喬治抵南非後，即將國國，以應付國內危機，此事余並無所聞，抑且認爲未必。南非政府高級人員均以爲如無極端危急情形，不致促令英王回國。南非國民澡主辦之某報今日首决在封面及政治新聞欄中以巨大篇幅記述此事，據稱：値此黑暗時期，英王本人必自願盡其職守，毫無疑問。王室在南非所享受之奢華，與英國人民之生活困苦，將成一尖銳對照。關於王室旅行之通訊報吿，對英人民將發生最不利之影響，或致引起嚴重政治發展，亦未可知。英王如能於急難時遄回本國，而令王后與公主或僅由公主繼續旅行，不獨對英人民將發生重大影響，即對南非人民亦然。</p>

<p>燃料恐慌影響重大</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕工澡政府之聲譽顯然已因燃料恐慌而大受打擊，一般與論對政府之於宣布斷電措施以前勿警吿國人，頗多批評。此次斷電措施，對於政府原來之經濟及工業計劃，顯然具有嚴重之影響。超過戰前出口額百分之七十五之目標，似已不能達到，而財相陶爾頓之預算案，亦不免爲之變動。政治方面之反響，亦殊重大，保守黨及保守黨系報紙，乘此對政府大施抨擊。然工黨議員四百名，則反而因此結成擁護政府之更堅決陳綫，工會方面亦多支持政府，對衆矢之的之辛威爾亦表同情、故料工黨政府當無垮台之虞。</p>

<h3>召開德奧和會　我應為邀請國　正根據波茨坦協定力爭中</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十六日電〕據此間政界消怠：關於德奧和的及德奧和會召開問題，我政府曾照會英美法蘇四外長，認爲（一）依據波茨坦協定及依據義匈保罷芬五國和的簽訂先例，對德奧議和之整關程序，應先由外長會議之五國外長協商決定；（二）關於德奧和會之召集與組織應由五國共同商定；（三）此次英斯科四外長會議之議程，應限於德奧和的之起草，如有變更，應得中國同意。另據南京訊，現美法兩國已有正式答覆，同意中國之主張，英方尙未答覆，但英外相前在巴黎及紐約時曾對我外長表示，贊同中國立塲，其答覆聞即將送出。又聞僅蘇聯一國之覆文，對和會召集問題反對中國之主張，但我政府仍在繼續嚴重交涉之中。緣我國立場完全合於波茨坦協定，倘協定定國對於協定之見解不同，自不能以少數者或一國之見解爲準。</p>

<h3>貝文暢論　英國外勻</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕貝交外相在工黨代表的五百名之私人集會中演說。</p>
<p>駐希英軍即將撤退</p>
<p>渠表示駐希　之全部英軍當於三月一日起之九十日內撤退。英國擬仿英法委員會之例，與其他若千國設立共同委咒會，討論經濟合作，該次集會歷時近三小時，貝文曾答覆各代表所提之問題。渠之演說首先檢討一般外交問題，謂英國之煤斤危機對其外交政策亦有妨碍。他國希望取得英國之煤斤放款及貨物，但英國一時不能供給，因此外交政策必須依此項情形而擬具。渠繼又述及最近之和約討論，並曰英國擬改良與蘇聯所訂之盟約，並與法國締結同盟。</p>
<p>希望德國成立聯邦</p>
<p>對於德國之未來，希望能有聯邦政制，使各邦有強大之權，而勿使權力太集中於中央機構。渠謂蘇聯似願有中央　權之德國，原因何在尙欠明瞭，希望能在莫斯科外長會中探知之。以言一般和平與安全之問題、渠不信任何國家尙願戰爭，裁軍雖屬必要，但必須於集體安全制確立以後，始能實行。渠在莫斯科會議中，將設法建立國際間之信任心，使集體安全制度得以確立</p>
<h3>艾克遜發表反蘇言論　蘇聯向美提抗議　艾氏曾明言蘇政策之侵略性</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十五日電〕此間廣播電台頃發出消息稱：美國參議院日昨開會討論任命李連泰　爲原子能委員會主席時，民主黨參議員麥凱萊向國務副卿艾克遜詢問；渠是否認爲蘇聯若擁有原子炸彈，則必將征服歐洲及全世界？艾克遜當即答曰：蘇聯現行政策，實爲侵略及擴張領土之政策云。美國聯合社暨其他各報均載有此項言論。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫本日已將照會送達美國駐蘇聯大使館，對於艾克遜之反蘇言論表示抗議，並請美國大使史密斯中將，將此項照會轉達美國政府云。</p>
<h3>東京五美兵　醉後后兇</h3>
<p>殺死日人五　廿名</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十六日電〕據美遠東空軍今日發表：有第五空軍所慶士兵五人發狂，在東京西之八丈島鎭，殺死日人五名，傷二十名。該五兵士將以謀殺罪，受軍事法庭審判。又稱，廖五士兵現監禁於第八軍之兵營內，其發狂原因，乃飲酒所致；</p>
<h3>日本賠償新計劃　美提交遠東委會計論　較鮑萊計劃放寬尺度</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十五日電〕關於日本賠償問題，頃據此問負責方面向本社記者談稱，美國對於將日本賠款總額百分之三十，立即分配與有關十一國一事，業已擬就一項計劃，並已提交盟國遠東委會討論。法蘇兩國亦在此十一國之內，對於美國所提出之計劃，刻正在研究中。按杜魯門總統之賠償專員鮑萊氏，最初曾向國務院提出一項日本賠償計劃，使日本工業回返至一九二八年之水準，日本現所有一切戰爭工業，大規模之鋼鐵工業，水電廠。以其他主要工業均不得存在，所有物資一律充作賠償之用。但此項計劃經國務院縝密研究之後，一致認爲鮑萊計劃，足以减低日本人民之生活水準，爰乃決定加以修正。將使日工業恢復至一九三二年之水準。此在盟國遠東委員會亦發表文件，提議准許日工業得保持其一九三二至三四年之基準。此外，蘇聯政府對於此事之態度如何，尙無法探悉。一般人士深恐蘇聯所持意見，以爲美國或將遲延分配日本賠償，藉以避免日本經濟崩潰云。</p>
<h3>今日的法蘭西</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>本文作者科斯勒係著名新聞記者及小說家，自從第一次世界大戰以來，曾密切注意歐洲局勢之暗潮。科氏為共產黨員，但不滿於共黨的政策，曾著一書，名曰「白晝的黑暗」，描寫莫斯科叛變審訊情形。</p>
<p>三個基本事實</p>
<p>法蘭丁今日面臨着三個基本事實：</p>
<p>第一，法國已經喪失她的最起碼的國家主權，即保護邊疆的能力。馬其諾防綫原來不過是一稱紙老虎，現在連這紙老虎都沒有了。一個國家從一等國的地位降到三等國的地位面其社會生活和國民性格不遭遇劇烈的變遷的，在歷史上尙無前例可尋。希臘衰而復盛，羅馬則一蹶不振。法蘭西文明究竟將循那一個方向前進，此刻還不能進料；因爲實際的變遷須得通過人民的意識，這在目前還不能見到。</p>
<p>法國目前所急切需要的是一種精神上的退隱；她需要若干年的和平與安靜，以便重新考慮她的各項問題，重估她的新價値。可是這是不可能的，一小部份由於經濟的情况使然，而大部份則由於第二個基本事實，即法國今日人數最多的政黨竟公然効忠於一個主義和傳統思想都迴然不同的外國。兩千年來素爲拉丁傳統思想之壁壘，今則一變而爲東羅馬帝國勢力的前哨。史達林的政制的好壞姑且不談，如果法國落入一個中國或墨西哥支持的黨派的勢力範圍，她的地位是同樣悲慘的。</p>
<p>第三個基本事實是：法國國內的主權也已經喪失了；那就是說，法國的行政首長已不復握有控制全國的實權了。說得更具體些，法國政府對於共產黨控制下的法國總工會的同盟罷工，將不能支撐到數日之久便得要倒下來。</p>
<p>法工會的實權</p>
<p>讀者須知法國的同盟罷工是和美國工會的總罷工和電梯工人，船塢工人或礦工的部份罷工是不可同日而語的。在現狀下的法國同盟罷工的意義談是這樣的：總工會的命令一下，全國的水電煤氣立刻斷絕，火東，地下列車和公共汽車立刻停駛，電話電報立刻不通，郵政立刻停頓起來。都市居民便得挨餓，一切生活宣吿停滯，入於睡美人的恣態。</p>
<p>在法國共產黨所持有的勝牌中，法國總工會的控制不過其中一張而已，雖然它或許是最重要的一張了。共產黨的五百萬投票人，它的公開的宣言，它在國會中的現身說法，都不過是一種革命運動的地下工作之表面的幌子而已，實際上那運動是含有一種陰謀的傳統思想，一種新權謀哲理以及大權的攫取。</p>
<p>最近常有外國難民甚至法國人被狙擊或被綁架的事情發生。他們大都是意見不合的共產黨員，以前曾經在大工廠或鄕村區域裏担任過相當重要的共黨職位，對於共產黨的內幕情形是很熟悉的。</p>
<p>自由主義低頭</p>
<p>眞實的案件恐怕不到五六件，但工廠中和鄕村中往往流言　起，過甚其詞，使黨員們漸漸覺得，即使一個起碼黨員，一旦有叛黨嫌疑，其結果不僅將被斥爲「法西斯煽動份予」，且將被視爲危險份子。這種威嚇的效果正是共產黨領袖們所持的目標：使該黨幹部受絕對的「布爾雪維兄訓練」，肅淸法國勞工階級的隨遇而安的個人主義。自由意志主義應代以嚴格的極權主義階級糾識，拉丁民族精神應代以東羅馬帝國精神。</p>
<p>一般人認爲這些淸黨行黨和相關的不法行爲，都是新成立的FTP份子的所作所爲。FTP是一種地下組織，人數不多，以法國全國計算，恐怕只有四五百人。他們好像一種共產主義的三K黨，只是缺少浪漫的件格而已。</p>
<p>第三縱隊實力</p>
<p>除了這種威嚇的手段以外，尙有潛入敵境政策。德國第五縱隊在荷蘭，比利時，法國境內秘密活動的成就，和法國的第三縱隊的能力比較起來，便算不得一同事了。第三縱隊是已經正式解散的第三國際的後繼者，它的實力有共產黨投票人五百萬人，訓練有素的黨員十萬人，它控制着內閣中許多重要的部和許多工會。要是共產黨決定發動一次改變，政府是沒有多大力量足以制止的。工會受他們的直接控制，警察受第三縱隊的暗中監視，陸軍散佈在海外殖民地和德國境內。某社会黨代表曾經說過：「共產黨如果决定接收法國的政權，只要打幾個電話便可以成功了。</p>
<p>共黨所取政策</p>
<p>不過此事的可能性在目前不過是一種理論而已。共產黨政變無疑會得到初步的驚人的成功，但是現在分散着的反對派，爲戴高樂和工團主義派，不久就會集合起來和他們對抗，結果是促成內戰，跟着引超雙方外援的千涉，形成西班牙一　　局面。這是共產黨領袖在目前所　　　免的。因此克林姆宮對法國共產黨發出如下的命令：要緩和穩健，要這着應變。隨時準備着。把握一切實權，待時而動，但切不可操切行事，以教引起難於應付的國際糾紛。（譯自紐約時報週刊）</p>

<h3>加緊澈查金潮　四監委奉派到滬　監察團今起展開工作　查有操縱市塲實據者決依軍法審判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕負責平抑物價杜絕投機之經濟監察團正式成立後，昨日因係星期例假，除內部準備工作積極進行外，對外未有重要行動。今日起該團假淞滬警備司令部五樓正式開始辦公，所有工作人員均係抽調警備司令部·警察局·市政府·憲兵廿三團·中紡公司等一部份人員混合組成，並爲避免流弊起見，各工作人員均發給辦案證明書，如有假名勒索者，可報告該團拘辦。今日起該團將根據日前　備司令部及警察局方面非正式所獲之重要綫索，對於有操縱金融嫌疑之人物，加緊展開偵查工作，查有實據渚即依軍法審判。已擬訂之抑平物價緊急措置辦法，經奉派來滬澈查金潮之鄭介民核定後，已於日前派專人送京呈　蔣主席核批。該國之存在期，將視需要而定，工作目標係使物價恢復二月一日以前之標準。因此次金融物價漲風純係投機心理造成，經濟監察團決以人爲之力量壓平人爲之風潮，工作勢將賡續相當時間。</p>

<h3>娼妓三萬人　多數患性病　市衛生局　設法阻遏傳佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕娼妓問題在未能澈底解決前，祗能就消極方面加以補救，即防止性病之傳染。市衛生局性病防治所成立於卅四年十二月間，其工作除性病防治外，尚有警察局委託之娼妓檢騐。機騐後，擇無毒者發給許可證，方准營業。據該所統計，去年一年前往檢騐之娼妓，共三千五百五十人，分屬於八百零九家妓院。檢騐結果：其中梅毒患者竟佔百分之五十八點三，淋病患者亦　百分之十五。尚有患其他性病者。故三千五百五十人中准予營業者祗一千三百四十五人佔百分之卅七點九。不准營業者二千二百零五人佔百分之六十二點一。而本市娼妓總數包括私娼等估計約達三萬人，性病傳染之可怕，由此可以想見。</p>
<p>一般娼妓多缺乏衛生常識，三千五百五十人中，能按月前往檢騐者，至後祗剩一人。警局與衛生局乃實行發給許可證制，由警局派員查察，無許可證者禁閉一星期。此法實行後，前往性病防治所檢騐之娼妓，乃較增多。</p>
<p>八百零九家妓院之分佈，以老閘區最密，共有五百二十四家，嵩山區，虹口及新成區次之。江寗區最少，祗一家。</p>
<p>據該所郁所長及董醫師告記者稱，衛生局現除合肥路性病防治所及天潼路有一分所外，本年內尚計劃設立性病醫院一所，性病防治所分所及夜間診療所多所。此外並擬至各工廠區向一般工人灌輸性病醫學常識，以阻遏性病之傳染。</p>

<h3>影戲院昨實行漲價　社會局表示未同意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電影院業在二月一日市府减低娛樂捐之時，曾自動調整售價，平均的减一成左右。然而爲時未及半月，昨忽又告調整，計漲一倍左右。據悉此次電影票漲價，公會取初規定頭輪自四千五至一萬元，社會局以新價調整尚未及半月，未可一再更變，批駁不准。但此項公文兩次送至公會，均以無人收受而帶回。同時公會方面亦已開會商討，再度規定票價爲頭輪四千至七千元，以致形成批駁自批駁，漲價自漲價之局面。惟昨據社局負責人表示，對影院此次漲價，不能同意，仍將予以制止云。</p>
<h3>漲價　電車公共汽車　可能提高票價</h3>

<p>毛女士談及國外婦女在戰後之生活情况，頗爲感動，據稱：歐洲及美國家庭婦女均咬緊牙關，節衣縮食，暫時放棄一己之享樂生活，使直接或間接協助國家復元。當渠在倫敦十五日內，僅吃到鷄蛋一枚，同時因無配給證，故無法得到肥皂，此外熱水亦不能多用，因燃料電熱缺乏故也。英國婦女包括有產階級在內，現均自任縫紉烹飪及其他工作。巴黎婦女亦同，目前着最新式之時裝婦女，招搖過市，已不多見，婦女均穿着簡潔破舊之衣服，但彼等並不因此抱怨，反引以爲榮，皆謂願爲復興法國而犧牲一切。</p>
<p>至今日之「黃金國家」美國婦女亦緊縮開支，一方面自謀工作，自給自足、大多數大學畢業女生，雖須照顧子女，料家務理，但仍出外工作，多數服務於紅十字會，女靑年會及其他婦女機構，渠等深以能參加工作目豪。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽　娘子軍施威　綠隊昨大破青聯　晨友勝甲申全黑勝鐵路京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，昨晚三塲，在市體育館角逐，首幕女子組綠隊以壓倒之優勢，大敗靑聯，結果爲五十四比十二　。决幕甲申以卅一比六十敗於晨友，壓軸戰，全黑以五十一比卅八力勝鐵路京。各幕戰情如下：</p>
<p>綠隊勝青聯</p>
<p>首賽女子組，靑聯戰綠隊，裁判吳子彬，王亦然。開賽後，黃明媛籃下首開紀錄，球迷呼喊之餘，再來一隻，李韞芝錦上添花，六比〇綠隊先捷。劉珍寳奪球犯規，靑聯劉鳳竹主罰，始破鴨蛋，劉珍寳還以顏色，靑聯楊堅巧中，然綠隊劉珍寳連罰帶擲，首節綠隊以十二比三佔先。二節綠隊攻勢依舊，靑聯仍無起色，僅孫鳳竹一罰，柳惠珊一擲，共獲三分，綠隊劉珍實一人天下，前半時結果，廿五比六綠隊遙領。易陣再戰，綠隊陳環治參戰，易出李韞芝，遂與阿媛珍寳三分天下，第三節卅七比六。結果綠隊以五十四比十二大勝靑聯。</p>
<p>晨友勝甲申</p>
<p>次幕戰，甲申逢晨友，裁判蔣吟僧周懷邦，晨友攻勢極猛，王炳福籃邊首開紀錄，王蓉生史久金加分，五比〇佔先。甲申呂妙盛數度衝刺，果建一功，晨友何錚還以顏色，甲申陶瑩石再中，雙方以一分之差，爭奪頗爲激烈。十三比九後，晨友重商戰略，果見大效，王炳福左右逢源，連中四元，何錚史久全更助桀爲虐，前半時結果晨友以卅一比十三遙領。易籃後，晨友攻勢仍緊，史久全首中得分，甲中陶瑩石還以顏色，甲申孫摩西私有不甘，單刀赴會，球運大通，連中三元，晨友見勢不佳，急以凌鵬王炳福易出黃存瑞傅其俠，聲勢又振，分數扶搖直上，甲申手足無措，時間完申畢，晨友以六十比卅一大敗甲</p>
<p>全黑勝鐵路</p>
<p>壓軸戰，全黑與鐵路京登塲角逐，，裁判劉荷生胡宏鑫，鐵路京胡思中底角首開紀錄，全黑張少卿還以顏色，胡思中又得罰進，全黑李祖德再建奇功，全黑士氣大盛。陸大振張少卿何孝光鼎足天下，分數驟增，十六比五，鐵路呼停，以避銳勢，果見功効，前半時結果，廿五比十八，全黑仍佔先。</p>
<p>易陣再戰，張少卿又連連得中，鐵路緊追不捨，卅六比廿九鐵路呼停，然全黑攻勢仍緊，少卿東山再起，鐵路蔣國平奮勇當先，還敬三球，法定時間完畢，五十一比卅八，全黑力勝鐵路京。</p>

<h3>籃邊絮語　綠隊五戰五勝　仍然是婦女藍球盟主姿態</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽，昨晚首幕女子戰，綠隊逢靑聯，這是一場可觀的球賽，育聯是後起之秀，可能予綠隊以威鴦，然觀昨日作戰的結果，綠隊還不失其爲盟主之姿態，五勝五戰，以壓倒之勢大敗靑聯。</p>
<p>靑聯孫鳳竹並未退休，他人視之爲靑聯獲分之鑰，然昨日戰來頗令人失望，七罰祗中其二，全塲僅擲中一球，計來共得四分。</p>
<p>靑聯李慧珍是後衛煞星，頗爲靈活，喜用轉身法，然身量較矮，恐怕還有點近視，否則當爲黃明媛所頭痛。</p>
<p>綠隊劉珍寳，近來球運亨通，她的上籃及射籃，都沒有什麼考究的姿勢，更沒有阿媛隻手上籃躍起時的弓形曲綫，然而就是準，昨晚獨得卅分，而與女靑紅一役，她竟創獨得五十一分的紀錄。</p>
<p>昨晚次幕，甲二部晨友與甲申一戰中，甲申初因手頭太差，所攻皆逸，失球累累，朱仲臨，陶瑩石諸台柱之投籃技術，仍需加緊訓練，而晨友黃存瑞本是遠攻奇手，但有時却一無所獲，昨晚就是如此，這恐怕是害着「射球寒熱病」。</p>
<p>壓軸戰，鐵路京背心褲衫，全付拼象，全黑則絨衣長褲，滿不在乎之勢，雖云烏合之衆，然而也有幾記硬殺的工夫。由港返滬的賈幼良，昨晚也登塲作戰，恐怕是旅途的疲乏，還未復原，故衝刺的力量，未見發揮。（德文）</p>

<h3>預算·物價·高利貸·財政經濟</h3>
<p>— 蔣君章</p>
<p>（一）從預算說起</p>
<p>三十六年的第二個月已經開始了，自從三十六年的開始，一直到現在，我們沒有一天，不被物價波動所困擾，此將陰歷年關時的結算，五天的商業休假，給予物價的刺激極大，而最近全國各地金鈔上漲的風潮，給予物價的刺激，更是駭人聽聞，可怕之極。這些事實所顯示出來的是財政經濟已經到了緊要關頭，我們自始即認爲勝利以後的中國，急切需要實現的只有兩個問題，這兩個問題：就是（一）政治上的和平統一，（二）財政上的收支平衡，只有和平統一，纔可以安定社會，昭蘇嘗盡痛苦的人民；只有收支平衡，纔可以停止膨漲，穩定直綫向上的物價，從勝利到現在，已經差不多一年半了，這兩個問題始終沒有解決，這實在是一件最可痛心的事。</p>
<p>現在三十六年的預算，已經初步完成，也已經經過參政會和立法院的審議，照原列的數字，收入七萬多億，支出九萬多億，主計長徐堪說這是抗戰以來支出和收入相差的百分比最小的一次預算，這却是事實，也是令人欣慰的一件事。參政會和自法院對於收入的增加和支出的減少，更多所建議，這兩個數目字當然可以更加接近，我們所期望的收支平衡，也許竟能達到，即使達不到，細微的差數，就紙面上說也不能算是大問題，但是在我們經騐上所感到的是這個預算能不能矢守勿渝？過去向年，每一年的預算，往往半年不到就要用完了，結果是不能不出於追加之一途。所以如此的最大原因，大槪是由於臨時的支出和物價的騰漲。三十六年度的預算是根據三十五年支出的情形而酌定的，現在三十六年只過了一多個月，而物價情形已迴非昔比，因此我們懷疑這個收支相當接近的預算，假使不加他種努力，也不過是紙上的平衡，於實際的財政問題是無所裨益的。</p>
<p>（二）高利貸和投機商人的影響</p>
<p>所謂他種努力，最重要的還是物價約有效控制，我們分析物價上漲的主要原因除了通貨增加以外便是社會游資的作崇，通貨的增加，造成了物價的上漲，更造成買賣貨物的暴利，這種暴利却鼓勵了游資趨向於這個途徑，商人更不惜提高利率以吸收之，這樣便形成了高利貸，現時商人，差不多沒有一個人不是和高利貸有關係的，高利貸的趨勢形成之後，物價的上漲，便更得了一個推波助瀾約有力因素，明顯地說，政府爲了維持幣値和穩定財政收支，用種種方法來壓平物價，使它不得上升，正合於一般人民（投機商人以外的人民）的需要，而一般人民購買力的薄弱，實亦足以阻止物價的上昇，可是物價如不上昇，則負荷高利貸的商人，便要遭遇到不可坻禦的惡運，便不能不用種種方法來促使物價　漲了，我們可以記得過去許多次的漲價，都是由於商人造謠說是幣制改變了或是官價外匯提高了，脆弱的市塲和人心，實在是經不起這種謠言的播弄，因此和這些有關係的物資便首先漲價。漲風一起，便如時疫之流染，瞬息之間牽連到各種物價，因而成爲一次普遍的騰漲，投機商人的笑口是開了，一般人民的生活都是苦了，而政府收支平衡和收縮發行的努力也澈底失收了，這不過是投機商人的伎倆之一端。</p>
<p>政府過去八個月中，財政政策是相當收效的，我們不用說別的，就拿物價來說，在四月以前，京滬區的物價，差不多二十天當中必有一次小彼動，一個月則必有一决大的波動，但自五月至七月的三個月中，保持着相當的平靜，然而在這個平靜的空氣中，却聽到另外一種呼喊，那就是所謂商業的崩潰，商人這樣的呼喊，同樣也見於去年十一月後的時間，引起了輿論界的同情，在新聞記者的筆下，往往描寫成爲整個的社會經濟崩潰，因而引起了普遍的注意。在事實上，今天投機商人和銀錢業有分離不開的關係，所以一家投機商號的倒閉，必然要牽連到銀行，甚或要使貪戀比期利息的薪水階級也要連帶受損。像南京這樣都市，如果二十家相常規模的商號倒閉，也許要牽倒一二家小銀行，在金融界引起相當的波瀾，而使一部份社會感到不安。爲了這種顧慮，迫使政府不能不作救濟性的考慮，去年八月的外匯調整，便多少含有這種意味。這就是說政府推行穩定物價的政策，結果引起投機商業的恐慌；因為要解除投機商業的危機，不能不給予調整物價的機會，但是物價愈調整，政府的支出愈增加，收支相差愈遠，不能不借助於發行，以抵補此差數。這樣便把整個財政政策自行破壞，而經濟前途，向更危險的方向又邁進一步了。</p>
<p>（三）憂亂物價者是人民的公敵</p>
<p>政府過去若干時期調整某種價格的姑息政策，徒然是鼓勵了投機商業的發展，使商業恐慌，又增了一步，我們但看每當物價有一决調整或波動的時候，利率必然大漲，如去年年底以前，以陰曆年總結算時之銀根緊急狀態，南京利率通常仍在一解五分以下，但在陰歷新年物價大波動的時間內，利率即驟高至二角以上，這個事實顯然表示出某一次的物價波動，是解決了上一期的商業危機，却又醖釀了下一期的商業危機，層層因果，無有已時。而且投機商人，因爲鑒於歷决調整物價時所獲之優厚利潤，養精蓄銳，伺機而動，造謠生事，賣空買空，無所不用其極，使正當商業，反受到極大的不利，而漸漸移轉到取巧的一途。這種風氣，實在是商業前途的致命傷。</p>
<p>我們平心而論，投機商人，以擾亂市價的手段，來達到非法收益的目的，在戰時是國家懸爲倒禁而繩以制裁的；在現在，擾亂金融，仍然是法所不許；而且這種行爲，不但是有害於國家，更是有害於大多數的同胞，就社會道德而言，更是絕對不容許的。就一般的道理　，要想得到非常的利潤，因而甘　非常的危險，甚而至於受到垮台的犧牲，原是意料中的事，由每個實利的人自己去負責任，投機商人，侵犯大衆利益，企圖滿其慾整，因而遭遇危機，甚至傾家蕩產，身敗名裂，這是自取之咎，原是應該得的結果，無須予以同情，更不必予以救濟，我們必須認淸，因爲物價平穩而遭遇危機的大半是投機商人，是商塲中的敗類，是波動物價約有力因索，是應該受制裁的；他們的呼籲獲得結果，便是國家財政政策的失敗，便是國民經濟尤其是薪水階級的生活，更爲困窘的開端。</p>
<p>總之一句話，物價高漲，無論國計民生，都要遭殃，而笑逐顏開的只有那些專門投機取巧的奸商。這一點我們要特別認淸楚的。</p>
<p>（四）穩定物價，要與投機商人奮鬥</p>
<p>總上所述，我們可以知道「平衡預算，穩定物價」這八個字，還是目前財政政策上的金科玉律，只是要澈底的執行，不可以有絲毫的動搖。只有物價的穩定，纔可以使預算不致破壞；只有物價的穩定，纔可以使專門投機取巧的奸商，自食其報；也只有澈底的穩定物價，纔可以使利率降低，正當商人不受高利貸的剝削，而正當商業也由此得到相當的保障。</p>
<p>不過我們要注意另外一點，高利貸的確吸收了社會上相當龐大的游資，投機商人的失敗，利率降低的結果，必然要使一般游資感到徬徨無措，政府應當抓住這個機會，發售可以賺錢的工廠，這一批游資一定可以導引到工業投資方面，政府也藉此可以回　法幣，以充國庫的開支。</p>
<p>抗戰八年多的浩大支出，使國家財政陷入山窮水盡的境地，使人民生活踏上無可維持的道路，這中間自然有不得已的原因，但是無可　言的，措置上也有許多應該硏究的地方。現在差不多已是膏　之症了，我們盼望這一次的物價波動是最後一次，我們深知這一年政府的預算，若照過去辦理，必然支出超過收入很多，而不能不仰賴於發行；但是這一個老辦法，不能再用了，必須要增多的確的收入—如從速出售敵僞產業或正在公營之工廠，甚或如向國外借款，務使發行不再增加；一面更要下定決心與投機奸商奮鬥而予以消減，使物價穩定，高利貸無從發生　最近的物價波動以後，一定有一段平穩的小康時期，政府就應該利用這一段時期，選擇那裏幾個物價易於波動而發生影饗很大的地方—如上海，天津，瀋陽，廣州等地，再選擇一二十種照過去易爲投機家利用波動價格的民生日用必需品與工業生產必需原料，先行布置，一有波動，立加控制，如此雖有上漲，必可平復，投機奸商必紛紛垮台，如此小心翼翼，過渡一年，則政局漸安，農村漸蘇，出口物資漸多，購買力漸大，然後財政經濟可漸入於康莊大道。</p>
<p>要之，今後一年間，爲中國財政之重要關頭，這個關頭的渡過，不是一個容易的事情，必須要政府和人民的加倍努力和合作，政府要盡它應負的責任，人民也要盡他應盡的義務。去年三月，中國國民黨第六屆中央委員第二次集會於重慶，翁文灝先生以經濟部長的資格，出席報告，他的結論是要求大家憑良心，盡責任，這個結論，現在依然用得到，尤其是想波動物價企圖厚利的投機商人們，憑你們的良心，勿再搗亂，否則必致自食其報。</p>
<h3>錢塘工程邁開第一步　富春江畔　開山採石（一）</h3>
<p>— 杭州九日快訊　本報駐杭記者黃行天</p>
<p>最近渡過杭州灣　子門沙嘴天險的「潘恩號」和「拖格」號海輪，以錢塘江沙灘第一個征服者底姿態，昂然駛進江門，着實轟動了杭州城裏和沿江的居民。沈主席利周市長爲此特地向船員們慶賀過，同時還歡宴了這批錢塘江上的「歷史人物」，現在，這兩隻海輸，己在經常地各拖着五隻木駁船（Wooden　Barge），裝運了滿船的石子，往返於湯山和四堡之間了。</p>
<p>湯山，這是錢塘江上叧一批「歷史人物」所創造的熱鬧地區。它位於富陽縣靈橋和里山二個小村的中間，是一叢俯瞰着靜靜的春江的富羣山，就是有各的阻塞蕭山義橋至桐廬江南公路通道的「湯山十嶺」，一叢不可耕植的石頭山。</p>
<p>砂石產區　赫赫有名</p>
<p>早在抗戰以前湯山的名字就已爲人所熟知，因爲著名的錢江大橋興築的時候，工程師們就曾來此採取大量的砂石，以供大橋工程的需要。如今，這些被人漠視的石頭山，又在爲了錢塘江兩岸人民底福利而貢獻出它們的力量了。抗戰以來，由於塘工的廢弛，江水爲災，已成很嚴重的現象。政府爲了愛護江南人民底生命財產，不惜投下鉅資，先後成立錢塘江海塘搶修委員會和錢塘江海塘工程局，一面緊急搶修坍毀海塘，堵塞海水蠶食土地；一面計劃錢塘江整治工程，興築挑水壩，使江水回於一定江泓之內，成爲航運暢通之有利江流。搶修工程，分作二部，先是用柴塘緊急堵塞；然後恢復乾隆皇帝留下的寳貴遺產——石塘。經過一年來的努力，在材料，經費兩感困難的條件下，柴塘的興築已大致完成，而今後的工程都寄託在石頭上了。過去幾個月內有好多工程均因石頭採辦困難而無一法開展，卒至進人停滯狀態。據塘工局佔計，今年六月底以前第一期工程計劃所需碎石及塊石已達十萬公方。如此火量石料如招商承辦不特費用浩火，抑且供求難應。爲了撙節經費，配合施工，塘工局才決定以「行總」所供給的最新式開山機料，自行在湯山採石，於是這個爲人遺忘了的名字，又在記憶中復蘇，而且更其鮮明了。</p>
<p>新機採石　彌足珍貴</p>
<p>用空氣壓縮機（Aio　Compressor）開山採石在國內猶是勝利以後方在復興建州設中應用到。據採石工程隊隊長吳工程師振岡告訴記者：在長江以南，祗湯山才有二架。長江以北，太來也有二架在黃河工程中應用，可是受內戰的影饗，那二架已被共產黨徒炸毀了。如今，在中國，建築工程中，用空氣壓縮機的，就祇湯山的二架了。經過了八年抗戰的破壞，在在都急需建設的時候，聽到這種不幸的消息，確是非常令人憤懣的。但因此却更使我們對湯山的兩架空氣壓縮機覺得特別可珍貴了。空氣壓縮機，外表上是一儸十五立方尺大小的單純機械，看不出有複雜的機件，由汽油引擎（Gasoline　Engine和壓縮器（Compressor）二部合成，每座可裝空氣鑽（Jackhamner）三隻，能鑽石之空氣壓力爲每平方分八十磅至每平方分一百磅，壓力不足時會自動調整，所以不需要人工管理着。空氣鑽的要件，則僅鑽桿，鑽頂和手柄及其上端部份三種。每個空氣鑽，在一刻鐘內可鑽石孔二尺，每日的可鑽孔五十尺至六十尺。如果是用人工鑽石孔的話，三個石工在一天之內，僅能鑽深二尺，相差懸殊，機械的效力，由此可見其偉大！空氣鑽和空氣壓縮機之間，則用導氣管連接，導氣管的二端是橡皮的，中問是一吋口的鐵管，就是平常用的自來水管。現在湯山沿江的山上，就都怖滿了這些長長的管子和爬山用的繩索。目前鑽孔的深度是六尺，孔與孔問的距離，自五尺到九尺不等，孔距巖石的邊緣約四尺至八尺，均須視石質的堅或鬆而定，每六尺深的孔，裝塞炸藥最多爲四個，（約一·四磅左右）即可炸去所需炸的石頭。（用三個則嫌不足）。他們所用的炸藥是Du-pont廠出品Gelatin（40Strength），侮箱有五十磅，分裝成一百卅五包，是長圓柱形體，外包防水紙，即使在水中也會爆炸的。爆炸用雷管塞在炸藥中，電路連接是用串連法，孔與孔間電綫長度達卅尺，把Blasting　Machine的機扭往下一　，正和用打氣筒打一下氣一樣，五十孔炸藥立刻同時爆炸，如果把電路縮短，還可多炸幾個孔。</p>
<p>裝藥炸石　冒雪實驗</p>
<p>據他們底試騐，最多一次可炸五十八孔，但每次都有一孔爆而不炸。記者到湯山訪問的那天，巧遇春雪，吳振岡工程師爲了使記者能實地觀察爆炸情形計，承他熟情地冒雪指揮裝藥炸石，做一决小規模的試騐。那次共炸六孔，爆炸的聲音沉重而不饗亮，但炸勢很猛烈，炸石也飛得很遠。記者站在一百公尺以外的地方遠看，還有很多石子從頭上飛來，嚇得記者趕緊收起照相機，往樹蔭下奔逃。而靠岸的木駁上，一吋厚的洋松船板，也被碎石敲斷了三條，其勢之猛，可以概見。現在所鑽的六尺深的石孔，侮决爆炸，一孔可炸出石塊八方至十方，即「放砲」一次，以炸五十孔計，每次即可出石四百方至五百方。這是一個很大的數字！炸了一次，人工淸理，差不多要三天呢！現在最大的困難，就是人工與機械不能配合，吳工程師說得好：「正和我們中國的社會一樣，新舊並蓄，配合不好，進展就遲緩了。而我們最大的困難，便是人工跟不上機器——這是很明顯地表現在淸理和運輸上的。</p>
<h3>半個炸藥　轟啐大石</h3>
<p>爆炸後的重要工作是淸理。其一是去泥其一是打碎大石、現有離正式抽水機一具，為汽油引擎，有馬達和電池，發動較易，每分種抽水量為三百五十加侖（一百廿五磅時）抽水，能沖洗山下當動力頭Duvamic　head在二石上爛泥。目前海塘工程所需石料，用以建造挑水和石盤頭，教以塊石爲宜。但炸開的大塊石頭，搬運非常困難，用人工劈碎，亦不大容易，遂用Mcd-Gy　Mstord炸破之，其法即在石上選一凹陷處，並注意其破壞面，放半個炸藥，把雷管放塞炸藥中，上堆濫泥約六吋，炸藥的炸力是向下的，大石便可轟碎。沒有位置放炸藥，便鑽成五吋或六吋深的孔後，再施藥轟炸，便可得到理想的塊石。至普通塘工需要的碎石，則有二座起重機或軋石機和一座預形碎石機　jawgosher，均爲汽油引擎。後者侮小時可碎石七立方碼，用人工則需要三十人左右，方足應付。前者猶未動用，惟碎石後可直接將石塊拋上船，則可减少人力不少。在該機未裝配完竣之前，搬石是一件最艱困的工作。普通商用木帆船，每次可裝石十五方，六人搬運，需時一日，由此可見炸石與搬石之速度懸殊，誠如飛機與步行之相岸。</p>

<h3>香港交通界慘劇　火燒西安輪兩三百倍搭客同時罹難　不死於火窟即溺水流</h3>
<p>— 本報四日航訊特約記者子健</p>
<p>「西安輪燬了！」這個消息傳播開去，港中居民紛紛跑到海傍「憑弔」這艘不幸的輪船。牠是香港居民的「老朋友」，在香港和廣州的水道上行走，已超過二十個年頭。香港的居民除了極少數外，差不多沒有一個不作過牠的搭客。勉强作一比方，西安輪與香港人的關係，恰和一艘行駛上海寗波間的大輪船與上海人的關係相同。</p>
<p>除了輪船和貨物的損失，的共値港幣五百萬元以上，西安輪的火災，且直接間接傷害了至少二三百人的生命。這個損失，實在太令人傷痛了！</p>
<p>火從烟出　霎時燒遍艙面</p>
<p>西安輪的起火，剛剛在牠開往廣州前的一小時，乘客大半已下船，有的旦在船裏睡過一覺，西安輪是規定本日上午六時啓程的，起火時剛在上午五時左右，那時，天還未亮，船尾的大艙間不知什麼原因，忽然噴起一陣濃烟，火從烟出，一刹那間便燒遍整個艙面向上層焚燒，上層的大餐間客人，聞耗及時走避，但艙裏的人走頭無路，艙門已給火勢封閉，若干人便躍水逃生。適逢殘月西沉，水流尚不湍急，但由船尾艙口泅至岸邊，計有百多英尺的距離，能够泅登彼岸或遭別人救起者爲數並不多，於是不燒死者便溺死，展開了一幅人問至慘的圖畫！</p>
<p>據該輪監督郵坤對記者稱：起火之處，在大艙「晏台」附近，當起火時，在塲各伴及搭客俱盡力搶救，出動棉被廿條之多，但火勢猛烈，火燄由棉被四邊洩出，不到十分鐘，即全船着火。</p>
<p>起火原因　尙待澈查明白</p>
<p>起火原因，尚未確實查明，最初之傳說，謂船上載有電油，因搭客失愼，遺下火種，致肇巨禍。但公司負責人已否認此說，謂船上從未接載任何危險品。另一消息：船上大艙所載貨物，有樹膠，沙藤，紙皮等物甚多，此次起火，疑係燃着此惹火之貨物所致船。</p>
<p>船尾着火後，火勢瞬即波及左邊船傍，該處接近碼頭，遂致碼頭亦受威脅。起火後約十五分鐘，滅火局即接到報告，滅火車全部出動，抵埠後先在碼頭部份施救，將碼頭火燄撲滅，但船上之火勢，不因救火員之集中灌救而稍滅，火勢漸漸延至右船旁，復由大艙延至尾樓三樓，全船各處無一不受波及，其中火勢最烈者爲船尾部份，船頭艙方面，僅受波及，尚有局部可獲保存。起火後，中西警探亦到場維持秩序，將碼頭附近交通封鎖，禁止行人通過，以便利施救工作，並提防有爆炸等危險發生。</p>
<p>該輪載貨共有三百五十噸，中以烟膠一千二百餘件，生棉一百五十件，（內有廿餘件救出）五金，鐵纜，鐵釘，廢銅，廢鐵，鋅片約二千件，西藥及顏料一千餘件，總數合共四千八百一十件，損失甚鉅，至低限度在百萬以上。</p>
<p>遇難搭客　至少兩三百人</p>
<p>至遇難搭客究有多少，則一時尚難查得其數字，但相信至少有二三百人。據聞在大艙中已發現被燒至焦黑之屍骸三十餘具，當消防隊員開喉注射時，即告粉碎，並見有腸臟等物琉出，厥狀至慘。</p>
<p>據公司消息：該輪預先在公司購票之搭客將及千人，本港大公書避副司理滬人車載青夫婦，今晨携其子女赴穗，起火時車抱其子，妻抱其女，跳海逃生，事後其女失踪。</p>
<p>跳海救人　古畫燬於火窟</p>
<p>干諾道粤南旅店夥伴張安，見義勇爲，曾跳下海中，救出搭客七人。</p>
<p>餐房搭客中，有一批是廣東古物收藏家，他們週前目帶珍貴的珍藏古物，來港參加展覽會。船中起火，他們的性命幸告安全，但大部分古物已葬身火中。聽說名畫之損失者計有黃大痴仙館就金圖，吳歷畫冊，丁震鵬扇冊，黃石谷冊，宋徽宗扇面及宋元雜冊，五代貫休達摩面壁圖，宋人子母猿等件，都是海內的珍藏云云。</p>
<p>入塢修理　兩三月後復航</p>
<p>記者獲晤西安輪船主威利，據談，此次船身被焚，機器幸獲保存，將來入塢修理，的兩三月即可復航。</p>
<p>西安輪載重六百六十噸，一九二四年建於香港太古船塢，爲同安輪船公司所有，已購保險八十萬元。經六小時焚燒後，仍浮水面，表面並不覺嚴重破壞。船中烟囱有一部份，尚未遭有刦。船頭弔橋部份，也祗有少許損失。太平洋戰事爆發時，該輪駛往澳門（其姊妹輪束安號則在港中海面沉沒），一九四四年爲日人騎刦返港。戰後收回，恢復行駛省港錢，已有一年之久。</p>

<p>在湯山採石塲還有兩具很重要的機器——堆土機（Bullsozer）D7和D4，由汽油引擎和柴油引擎二種合成，用以堆土平地和拖曳重物，湯山全部機器的移動，全賴它們底力量。最近，吳工程師和機械組組長盧良惠，正設法把D7堆土機拖上山去。因爲離山式抽水機的水壓力很小，不足以洗刷掉山上表土，所以想用推土機推掉表土，以减輕冲洗工作的負祖，節省人工，使工作加速。據吳振岡先生表示：「海塘需石極多，如治本工程開始，六年計劃實現，在杭州灣上大建挑水壩和石盤頭時，更需大量開發。所以我們要把人工積極减少，做到完全用機械採石，搬石，運石的地步！」我相信他的話在不久是會實現的。現在，他們正在做二個碼頭，已有潘恩號（六百五十噸）和拖格號（四百五十噸）二隻海輪，二十隻木駁，每隻可裝石五十方，每輪施五隻木駁，一天可裝五百方。但搬石配合不起來，所以現在還祗能每天運石二百方至三百方，一月以二十晴天計，每年可出石六萬方。這個數字與原定計劃相較，雖然短少四萬方，但祗要搬運工作能機械地和炸石工作密切配合，那麽不但可以追加，而且可以超出預定限額呢。從開工至今，歷二月餘，已出石一千方，僱工以工賑麵粉每三工一包計，平均侮天可得十四斤。如照包工，每方需費七千元。現照成本會計算，則侮方僅五千元。換句話說，每年目標可節省經費一萬〇二千萬元。何况包工將因物價指數而提高，自採則可因產量日多而减低成太呢！</p>
<p>目前在湯山工作的工程師，管理員，機匠和工友，每天平均有四十人，其中除工程隊人員外，有長工十六人，一面工作，一面受機械訓練。他們分住着兩座活動房屋，有自來水，有電燈，一架D．C．　Generatos　1.5KW的直流發電機，可使60　Watts的燈泡大放光明。這在湯山是値得驕傲的，因爲自杭州溯錢塘江而上，沿綫祗有湯山有電燈呀—屋內的設備是簡陋的，睡的都是軍用帆布床，但記者曾在裏面宿了一夜，住得很舒服，簡直　熱如初夏。那晚雪下得很大，但我們一個人都沒有覺得，全體工作人員多屬靑年，不但熱情活潑，而且相處如同家人。他們起初過的是潮濕的蓬帳生活，不久便造成了這個以活動房子爲中心的「獨家村」三面環山，前臨大江，從前是死寂的山谷，現在已成爲生氣蓬勃的地方了。臨近的村民們都用好奇的心眼觀望着他們底新鄰日　　榮。祇有一點使他們不安，就是山上的財神廟給工程隊做了火藥庫，農曆新年時，多少人要想云燒香拜佛而無從拜起。一個里山鎭的「士紳」咕嚕地向記者訴苦：「菩薩是我們的大事，他們把火藥裝江了廟，這個，這個，……」其實呢，村人們是為了自己的命運而去求拜菩薩，工程隊都是用他們底雙手去營沿工的農民們創造好的命運！錢江水患代有災厄，他們是要用人的力量去制服魯莽的錢江水性，好像我們底祖先用手馴服了牛，馬，替火類服役一樣，他們不但要使水不會再傷害沿江居民，而且要使它能爲人類服役，創造良田萬頃，便利舟楫運輸。採石工程隊正肩負了這個伟大計劃的最基本使命。他們要把寄託在虛無的菩薩身上的農民們底命運，放在現實的世界中，抓在人自己底手裏。他們是先驅者，雖然他們用火藥包圍了菩薩，但他們是對的，是應該被尊敬，被愛護的。記者離開了湯山的「獨家村」，對他們生氣蓬勃的一羣，將永遠寄予着無限的懷戀和期待！（八日夜寫於富春江畔漁山）</p>

<h3>且慢歌頌這活地獄</h3>
<p>爲什麼不在共產區裏的人，很多以爲共產黨好？</p>
<p>但是爲什麼共產區裏的人，却都想盡了計巧，寗願冒了千艱百險而逃出來？他忍得背井離鄉，拋棄了年老的父母，他忍得拋棄了嬌妻愛子，難道他不知道逃出來是衣食無着？睡馬路，他不知道犬寒無衣凍餓交迫的滋味？但他不顧一切的逃出來，天哪！他爲什麼不顧一切的逃出來呢。</p>
<p>不在共產區很多以爲共產黨好的人，是不足怪的，因爲他們遠離了那個社會，而沒有看破那個「社會之謎」。</p>
<p>當你不認識一個人或沒有到過的地方，而先聽到了那人的大名，或某地的盛况，那你心目中所理想的一切的一切，都不是那人或某地的眞象，除非你眞正的和那人相處，或到某地逛過，你的認識才是眞實的。</p>
<p>對於共產黨的謎，爲了使大家明瞭眞象起見，最好能使他有機會去嘗嘗那一般陰險很惡血腥腥的滋味，但假使逃不出來却千萬莫怪我呢！（阿冰）</p>
<h3>常熟區尚有私塾</h3>
<p>日前因事過大木橋路，忽聞喃喃誦讀之聲，筆者好奇心重，循聲探視，竟有幼童四五十人，環坐黑暗茅屋中，由敎師用一世紀以前方法敎讀，課本旣非國定，屋內光錢允不合兒童視綫，且用客籍方言，字句含糊不淸，想常熟區境內，公私學校林立，足敷適應學童需要，何以尚有私熱設立，希敎育常局派員視察，度其情形予以取締，以重敎育，而振頽風。（馮異）</p>

<h3>朶拉　—「俄羅斯人剪影」之一</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作　侍桁譯</p>
<p>在療養院裏，有八個患肺病的人。在一切病人之中，肺病患者通常是最任性的：因為只要他們的濕度昇高一點點，他們便會無緣無故地恐懼，憤怒，或是頹喪。</p>
<p>肺癆菌有一種兩相抵觸的力量：它在一面殺害一個人的生命，一面又喚起他對於人生的渴望。這一點可由下列的事實看得出來：肺病通常都具有一種高度的色情的特色，同時，就連最無望的病人都對於恢復健康具有頑强崇高的信仰。我仿佛記得病理學者斯特朗佩爾稱這種狀况為「肺結核的希望。」</p>
<p>有八個肺癆患者一同生活在克里米亞的一家療養院裏，他們全被一個身世不明名呌朶拉的侍女所看護。有時她說她是愛沙尼亞人，有時又說她是卡列里亞人。不過，她說話的樣子，像是一個陶立德人。她說話有時發出　靻人的聲調，又有時發出亞美尼亞人的聲調。她身材高大而健壯，但是脚步很輕，她的行動敏捷而　巧。在她的面孔上有一種馴馬似地良好性質；她的紅唇涵有親切多脂肪似的微笑，她那雙大眼睛，發出奇怪的淡紫色的色澤，包藏着那種微笑的油質。當她沉思時，她那比較無光的眼睛，便罩上陰雲，眼光雙成死板的。她沒有什麽學識面顯得　，尤其當她要裝作狡猾的時候，她顯得特別地蠢。因此病人們稱她為「杜拉」（俄語像瓜之意），並不十分高明地戲弄着她的名字。但是那個女兒不因此就生氣，繼續地微笑着。對待病人，她像一個母親對待孩子們那麽寬容。每當肺病的男人伸出冰冷鉛色的手抓她時，她便用她那又大又紅的手掌穩靜地推開那個不幸的人的可憐濕潤的手，同時說道：「別抓）這樣對你不好。」</p>
<p>各式各樣的人固執地向她求愛：店舖伙計，脚伕，有一次是一個儼　强力的漁夫——一個鰥夫。他們喜歡她的粗狀美，她的體力，她的不倦不休的精力，她的樂天的性質。每一個人都相爭取這個和平溫順的動物為他的人生的伴侶；但是她對於男人的態度，像是一個自由自在的富翁，她十分明瞭什麽時候什麽地方應當使用她的資本。她用那千篇一律的無表情而不得罪人的微笑，拒絕那些結婚的提議，她靜聽着病人們說不完的想念，推開他們魯莽的愛撫。</p>
<p>無論天刮北風，或是濃霧帶着一層嚴霜裏往小山頂上的房屋，無論病人們萎縮在厚被窩裏，或是穿起暖暖的衣服還在抱怨天冷的時候，她都熱得難過。到了夜間，安排每一個人都睡了之後，朶拉便在頭上裏住一條角上刺繡着紅薔薇花的黑色領中，走到洋台上，在我的窗下，跪下地來，眼望着天空，嘆息着祈禱：</p>
<p>「啊，聖母啊……基督，主啊！你，聖尼格柆，上帝的讒遜的僕人！……」</p>
<p>在朶拉身上，我看不出詩意，她不喜歡花，認為花只會弄亂了房間。一天夜裏，一個牧師的妻，正在苦痛着腸內的結核菌，而因為天空與羣星的光彩一陣狂喜之時，朶拉粗暴地驅逐開她的熱情。「天空」，她說，「像是一個野菜肉丸子……」</p>
<p>有一天，第九個病人來到了。他很費力地喘息着，爬到閣樓上的樓梯，把住頂上的欄干對朶拉說：「你看我是多麽漂亮的一個漢子，是不是？」</p>
<p>這種說話裏是混合着哀慟與快活。他微笑着，瞥視着那個偉大的大姑娘，她圓圓的聲滿的胸膛。</p>
<p>「哈！你是一個多麽健康的動物！」他說着急忙咽進口冷氣。「喔，你可以帮助我恢復健康，你可以吧？」</p>
<p>「喔，當然的，」朶拉發着她亞美尼美人的聲調答道。</p>
<p>這個人有一副夜貓子的面孔，一雙圓圓的貓眼睛，一隻鼻頭下捲的鼻子，少許黑鬍髭，總之是一副冷笑殘忍的面孔。</p>
<p>從那一天起，朶拉像是受了魔術似地改變了，給我們很大的不舒服。她開始不睬我們的願望，匆匆忙忙地走過我們的房間，無氣無力地打掃着，對於我們的怨言和責難只是惱怒地答應着，然而同時在她馴馬似的眼睛裏却閃出一綫陶醉的光。她像是突然間變得又聾又啞，時常關切地轉頭對着閣樓，那個像夜貓子的小學生菲力波夫，便躺在閣樓裏咳嗽着唱不過氣來。白天一有空，朶拉就跑到他那里去，在他的房間裏一直呆到日落，絕沒有辦法把她誘引出來。</p>
<p>說到那個人——他快要死了。死的情景和平常不一樣，他嬉笑嘲罵，從始至終嘴裏呼哨着一個喜劇音樂的調子，可是因為陣陣的咳嗽，歌調時常中途斷了。他有點故意作做；他看樣子是一個天不怕地不怕的惡魔，但是那假面具終於很巧妙地揭穿了。</p>
<p>「這些怪事你都怎麽想法，我親愛的朋友？」他時常這樣對我說，同時　着他的貓眼睛。「這些你都歡喜嗎？白日，夜晚，誕生，戀愛，知識死亡，是不是？這不滑稽嗎？正如法國人所謂N＇estce－pas？對於一個二十六歲年紀的人尤其是滑稽——這一點我是講我自己……朶拉！」</p>
<p>這時我聽見匙子聲和傢具的沙沙聲，朶拉出現了，張大着眼睛，沉默地等待這個人的吩咐。</p>
<p>「我的善良的老家，給我拿些葡萄來，趕快！」他會這樣吩咐她，然後轉過來對我說：「一個極無知而愚　的女人。」</p>
<p>他恨一切的病人，他們只要露出一點點的怪樣子，他便無情譏笑，人家也不喜歡他。至於我，他所以和我成了朋友，是因為他喜歡文學，這使我們很親密。</p>
<p>「文學是人的一切發明中最好的一種，」他會用他鉛色的手摸着唇這樣說。「越是與生活接近的越好……」</p>
<p>據我看來，他之要死，肺病的關係少；倒是因為他的靈魂受了嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>他在進了療養院的第六十九天死去了，在死亡的痛苦中他茫然地嘰咕着，「菲瑪……我整個的一生……我愛你……只有你……永遠地，菲瑪……親愛的……」</p>
<p>當時我正坐在他的床脚邊，朶拉站在菲力波夫的身旁，她吸着鼻息，用她的大手掌拍着她的乾頭髪。</p>
<p>她拿了一包東西，夾在她的臂窩囊。</p>
<p>「他正說什麽？」她不安地伸直了身子說道。「他說的「菲瑪」是什麽人？」</p>
<p>「顯然是一個女兒，一個婦人，他以前愛過的，眼前還在愛着。」</p>
<p>「他嗎？這個——匪瑪？」朶拉驚訝地大聲問。「不—不，他愛的是我。他一來到這裏，他就愛我……」</p>
<p>但是她再靜聽那個學生的譫語，她揚起她灰色的眉毛，用她的圍裙擦乾她的濕潤的面孔，把那包東西丟到我的膝上，說道，「這是他的葬衣；襪子，襯衫，拖鞋。」於是她悄悄地離開了房間。</p>
<p>二十分鐘以後那個學生菲力波夫停止譫語了。他很熱烈地望着白牆壁上黑色方形的窗口，嘆息一聲。顯然他要說什麽話，但是說不出來。其次，他的渺小的肉體，一直精疲力盡到骨髓，便在永恒的和平中挺直了。</p>
<p>我去找朶拉。她正站在洋台上，下瞰天空與海交接的地方，那樣地黑暗，却在兩面有所不同。她轉過她的胖臉來望着我，我驚訝地發見那臉孔是異常地嚴峻。</p>
<p>「他已經死啦。你去安葬他吧，朶拉。」</p>
<p>「我不願意。」</p>
<p>朶拉開始用脚擦地，宛如要塗掉唾沫的樣子。</p>
<p>「我不願意，」她反復地說。我不想替那樣的一個人作任何事情！你想想看，他算是什麽人！他說他愛我，然而他却一向都在……」</p>
<p>「是的，但是你看他不是已經死了嗎？」</p>
<p>「喔，那有什麽關係？當然我曉得他死了。我不是瞎子，對吧？我甚至用了我最後的一文錢替他買了葬衣。他剛剛一到這裏，我就曉得他要死的，可是我對我自己說：可憐的孩子！……一定會死的！然而每一個人都不能不死。但是他為什麽要作假呢？「我從沒有愛過一個女兒，」他說。好吧，現在你躺在這裏，並有一個女兒給你。……死可以隨你去死，但是不能作假……」</p>
<p>她聲音低低地在說話，像是心裏想着什麽旁的事情。其次，突然問，她啜泣起來——那麽傷慟的啜泣，宛如她呑了滿滿一杯的滾水，燙壞了自己。</p>
<p>「來吧，朶拉！……」</p>
<p>「如果對於這種人，你的心地還那麽好，你自己替他穿衣服吧！至於我——不，不，我不願意。他對我算行了什麽呢？——一次遊戲而已！」</p>
<p>「我不曉得怎樣替死人穿衣服……」</p>
<p>「我管這些作什麽？我不認識他，你說我認識他嗎？」</p>
<p>「但他究竟是死掉了啊！」</p>
<p>「喔，那又怎樣呢？你別權我。我不想看那樣的一個人……不應該作假……」</p>
<p>到底她拒絕去替他穿衣服，獨自留在洋台上。</p>
<p>當我替那個學生菲力波夫穿葬衣的時候，我驀地聽見一陣低低的痛心的悲泣。我跑出來，走到洋台上。</p>
<p>有時，會使人類特別地流淚，兇猛的，刺心的淚：朶拉哭出來的就是這樣的淚。跪在地板上。頭撞着欄干，哽咽着，悲泣着，發出刺耳的嘶呌聲，吐着這樣的言語：</p>
<p>「我暴虐的親人哪，我的小怪物，我的最親愛的，我忘不掉的兒呀……」</p>

<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>南京旣光復，黨人為鄭容開追悼會。章太炎撰聯云：「諸君鼠竊狗偷，死者不瞑目。此地龍蟠虎踞，古人之虛言」。可謂嬉笑怒罵，皆成文章者矣。</p>

<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>

<p>答客</p>
<p>飄愁有客到江村，玄意先窺眾妙門；久悟莊嚴空色相，寗須刻畫辦　尊；芬芳且喜靈心在，篇什猶　雅道存；作達藏名吾已愼，願將出處共君論。</p>
<p>萬古恒流故亦新，貞無剝復竟何因；閉門風月渾閒事，過眼江山孰主人；遠壑隆　成永歎，行靈歸島亦相親；同君至意微芒裏，好向神州認此身。</p>
<h3>散文二題</h3>
<p>— 之默</p>
<p>報童</p>
<p>報童，這新聞的綠衣人，終天忙碌的奔跑。</p>
<p>他為生活拼命去傅播眞理的火種，去送達人民祈求的福音；從清早到傍晚，他大聲的吆喝，急促的趕路；在嚴寒的黎明，風雨漆黑的夜昨，他拉着長聲喊：「賣報紙！」</p>
<p>我每逢聽到這幼弱的呌喊，一種憐憫的思緒立刻在心中氾濫起來。我沉靜地想：一張報紙，經記者的採訪，編輯的整編刪改，手民的排版刷印，不知經過好多辛苦，才投胎到報童的手中，去向人間散播………</p>
<p>然而，在這經濟動盪，物價飛揚中，眞是被戰爭所淹沒，福音被撕殺所代替，整個的篇幅，充滿着這不祥的字塊，於是人膠開始厭惡和煩惱。</p>
<p>但忠實的報童，仍冒着嚴寒，傅送着這昨天的歷史，今日的精神食糧！</p>
<p>雨衣及愛情</p>
<p>不知誰觸怒了雨神，逼使這冬日的冷雨終天在哭泣……</p>
<p>人們很冷靜，從不沾染着這洒下的淚水，去向人間宣揚大地的苦難。</p>
<p>在這原子時代，雨絲在玻璃上跳舞；於是，雨衣應巿登塲，向人們炫耀——這愛的信使，報送了貴重的禮物，開始贈給他所鍾情的人。</p>
<p>在夜晚，漆黑的院子裏，傅來了男女的對話。</p>
<p>「你果眞接受人家的雨衣？」</p>
<p>「我怎麽好拒絕啊！」</p>
<p>「我們這幾年愛情……」</p>
<p>「愛情！它不能防抵雨水啊！」</p>
<p>這一塲冬雨的悲劇，在迸濺聲中完塲，消失。</p>
<p>於是，冷雨更傷心的哭泣……</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　170</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「突擊之後，他們必定吃虧；甚至惱羞成怒。這個怒，當然達不到我們身上。像他們那樣無賴，勢必遷怒到老百姓頭上。無緣無故，他們却要把老百姓抓起來，捝他們是「不穩份子」。我們突擊之後，他們更可借題發揮，大姦擄燒殺一番了！倒楣的還不是這些無辜的老百姓們？……我的意見……」</p>
<p>鶴見說到這裏，倐然停頓了，好像說書的說到要緊頭上，宣佈「明天再續」，賣羨關子一樣。想必也眞有些口燥舌乾，鶴見抓起烟捲，分給我和W君，各人一枝；同時很抱歉似的，瞧了耀羣和小虎城一眼；表示無法供給烟捲以外的物品，來鎭壓他們的神經。</p>
<p>「我的意見，也倣效諸葛孔明的秘訣一樣；「未思進，先思退；」那就是說，在未行突擊之前，我們應當替老百姓們，築起一道保護牆來。另一方面，還得替我們的部下，作一個安全的打算；因我們手下，根本只有這們數提清楚的幾個人，這一點點精華，絕對不能消耗，作過分的犧牲……」</p>
<p>W君閃燦着那雙聰明的睛眼笑了，可是他並沒有插口，因他要聽下去，要知道鶴見的打算，是否跟自己的計劃相同。</p>
<p>「我願意先走一趟，探探他們現在的實情，然後再擬定一個似乎「瞞天過海」的方式，給他們把眼睛　起來；再利用一個有效的安全方法，給他們一個突擊，只給他們一個厲害，呌他們不敢亂動——</p>
<p>「風才您不是說我們這個根據地，有些不穩定嗎？這一點我也得打聽一下，看這不穩定，到了什麽程度。我疑心我們也許有些神經過敏？……」這句話似乎對W君有　　刺，但鶴見在語調和神態上所表現出來的血誠，把辭意上的棱角圓化了。</p>
<p>「也許；」W君也表示猶疑了，「不過我認為要把這個神經過敏的霧層，一律掃除乾凈了才好；特務工作的安全，一絲也不能恍恍惚惚，要着着實寶！剛才您提出的「瞞天過海」方式，恰在我們計劃之中，也是我特意來請敎的大目的——這一個手法，恐怕完全要借重老兄了。……」W君的神情，畫出了一個問符號。</p>
<p>「行！」鶴見也聰明地笑了。這正是「英雄所見略同」的表現。「可是我得利用那位古人化的老頭兒一下——他喜歡裝模作樣的倣效古人，實際等於猢猻做戲。……老兄可是這同樣的辦法？」</p>
<p>W君笑着點點頭。緊接，他們研究了一下關於電波距離的技術。我心下很明瞭他們兩人在搗什麽鬼，耀羣對電波很有研究，當下給他們很好的一個補充。在座只有小老虎，不僅不懂得這一段談話的題材，更不明白剛剛談得起勁的突擊，為什麽忽地移到電波上去了；所以楞着眼睛，注意各人的表情。</p>
<p>我們把突擊的時，地方式，善後，撤退，等等步驟，又從頭到尾研究了一番。研究的過程中，耀羣的貢獻，不僅震動了W君，把鶴見也驚呆了。他雖說曾經支配過耀羣的學程和時間，大槪還沒有料到耀羣的學力如此强大，進境如此高深。他在佩服之餘，一面驚喜，一面却又有些慚愧似的，慚愧甚麽？正合着一句俗話，「狗眼看人低」！我想他以前，也不過把耀羣當作一個普通「不尋常」的女子罷了；至多也不過把她放在萍子一般的水平綫上。在這次談話之後，我想他要用適度增高的眼光來看耀羣。</p>
<h3>爝火—人生隨筆之一</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>柯洛連珂（Korolenko）有一首以「爝火」為題的散文詩。他說：「一個黑暗的秋夜，在一條險惡的河流中航行，沒有星，沒有月，天黑沉沉，地也黑沉沉，一切都是黑沉沉的。忽然望見前面河流的轉灘處，烏黑的山脚下面，閃動着一點爝火。閃動得又明顯，又强烈，並且十分臨近。我很喜歡的說：「哈，老天保佑，快進住宿的地方了」！搖擼的人轉過頭來望一望，淡淡的說：「還遠呢」！我不相信，爝火明明就在前面，看去只須再搖兩三櫓就可以到了。但是，搖櫓的人畢竟有經騐；我們的船，還在黑如墨水的河流中航行了許久。可是那一點爝火，還在前面，一閃一閃，在那裏招手引人，總是這般近，又總是這般遠。人生，就像在這樣險惡的河流中航行，爝火還離得遠呢！但是總在前面，一櫓一櫓的搖上去，總有到的時候」。</p>
<p>初讀這首詩，是十五六年前的事了；歲月推移得越久遠，我老是記得：「人生，就像在這樣險惡的河流中航行，那一點爝火，在前面，一閃一閃在那裏招手引人，總是這般近，又總是這般遠」，的話。十五六年前，我也曾很喜歡地迎接那爝火，以為「快進住宿的地方」了！直到今天，我還只能相信搖櫓的人的話：「還遠呢」！我們唯一的信念，是：一櫓一櫓的搖上去，總有到的時候」</p>

<h3>戲劇節聯歡會上</h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>電影戲劇界的人都到了，大家說：「都是一家人！」</p>
<p>巿立劇校的門口，監起了慶祝戲劇節的小牌樓，一如舞台上的佈景，這是劇校同學給人看到的第一個成績。</p>
<p>四樓會塲門口的簽名處，就有許多劇校同學趨前招待，簽名紙上田漢的名字特別大，每個人都要對它看一眼。</p>
<p>展覽塲也在一起，平遽的部份是徐慕雲收藏的資料，包括許多照片雜劇集，臉譜的圖。第一件展覽品是張學良督魯時慶祝雙十節的戲目單，參加演出約有尚小雲，佘叔岩，梅蘭芳，荀　生等等，壓軸戲由楊小樓演，戲迷大為羨慕。</p>
<p>話劇展覽的部份，有不少莫斯科藝術劇院的劇照，另外許多法國的劇照，註解都是法文，一個懂法文的來賓被拖住了給別人講解。</p>
<p>戲劇電影界的人都到了，劇校同學忙着請前輩們簽名，他們簽名薄上的名字，就和門口所簽的名一樣完備。</p>
<p>聯歡會開始，熊佛西先顧一樵致詞，在學交裏，熊佛西是敎務主任委員，顧一樵是副主任委員，雖然後者身為敎育局長，熊老還是當仁不讓。</p>
<p>點心四色，計開花生米，三明治，牛肉，洋山芋塊，都是劇校同學親手做的。酒，據說無限供應，可是酒鬼們對那些冰冷的黃酒也不感興趣。</p>
<p>然而熊佛西最起勁，他一再拖住別人乾杯之外，也慇懃以花生米饗客，嘴裏不絕地「花生好吃，花生米眞好嗎？」</p>
<p>表演節目沒有排定，趙景深被哄上台，唱了一節崑曲，皆還不够，他還演「西廂」裏張生和崔鴛鴦的故事。</p>
<p>吳祖光說笑話本領頂好，逃不了。</p>
<p>丁聰在台上沒有什麽好表演，他說：「大家看囈我算了。」</p>
<p>一位來賓在華爾滋的音樂中表演「擺蕾」，舞姿優美，坐着的人，也都站起來看。</p>
<p>節目缺少，作為主人的熊佛西和吳天，見人便拖，令人不敢親近。</p>
<p>不少歌唱節目，雖未必都令人滿意，采聲鼓掌聲却總是歷久不息。</p>
<p>北西川路交通擁擠，來賓到得較晚，每到一個前輩先生，手掌簽名簿的劇校同學大起忙頭，人們可以因此熟識許多人，這位是李健吾，那位是于伶……。</p>
<p>人們也因此曉得夏衍和應靈衛沒有到。</p>
<p>會塲中四隻大火缸頂受歡迎，每隻火缸都被圍得沒不通風，不相識的人也因此攀談得很融洽。一戲劇界是一家人！」每一個人的內心也和炭火一樣炎熱。</p>

<p>曾文正最籌製對聯，張文襄亦每以自詡，湘鄉所製，膾炙人口者甚多，蓋聯語以確切不移為主要，於對方因不可用通套語。而自己身分口吻，亦必須恰合方妙。南皮生平所製，除各種長聯外，尤善運用成語，妙造天然，並世無兩。李合肥初入相，是歲賜壽，文襄。自撰一聯賀之云：「朝廷相司馬矣！老子其猶龍乎」？上句用宋史，切初入相。下句用道德經，切李姓，口吻之超妙偉大，固非他人所能及，而對方身分，尤非文忠不克當此。迨文忠六十壽，文襄幕中，高材碩彥。所擬聯語，南皮無一當意。及賜壽期近，黃仲　太史，為文襄姪壻，亦在幕中，從容論及此次聯語，恐無以踰前者所製。文襲掀髯大笑曰：「足下何輕量老夫耶？昨於薄暮，偶思得一聯，非惟仍用成語，抑且仍係十二字」。舉座相顧愕然，私計未必可能，南皮即於所備　紙賀壽聯上，援筆一揮，其聯云：「天生以為社稷，人望之若神仙」。蓋上句為唐壽李北平傅中語，天生李晟，以為社稷。下句乃用李郭同舟故事。然此聯若非祝文忠壽。倘移之其他李姓相國，身分亦萬不相稱，其難不在兩句引成語，皆係李氏偉人，而難在適合合肥平大亂成大功之宰相身分，然亦幸李姓有此典實，對曾左即未必有此恰好成語。此事吾乃於沈寐叟座中，聞之黃仲　先生者。寐叟云：此二聯之獨出冠時，羣相傅誦，不媿名聯，不但湘鄉大手笨，無以過之，即紀文達所作，純廟壽聯，雖頌揚得體，而超妙偉　亦不能壓倒也。</p>

<h3>偷得浮生半日閑　替你介紹一家咖啡座</h3>
<p>— 章文</p>
<p>上海的咖啡館本來大都專營外國人的生意，尤其是過去霞飛路一帶，當華燈初上，不乏一些白俄貴族，羅宋美人在一些烟霧迷　的小咖啡館中，或引吭高歌，或漫吟低唱，頗有些羅曼締克的情調。而自從飲咖啡的風氣流行到我們高等華人之間以後，專營中國人生意的咖啡館也風起雲湧了，在上海淪陷時期，咖啡館事業有過一個黃金時代，居然也有個咖啡大王（CPC）的　資本家。但那些專營國人生意的咖啡館，常常是佈置惡俗，價錢很貴，於是一些愛喝咖啡又頗注意咖啡館情調的人們，便反而向一些洋人經營的咖啡館中，去尋找一些比較清靜的所在了。在敵偽時期英美顧客，都關在集中營裏，那些咖啡館也落得乘機做做中國人生意，因此很有幾家至今座上有不少中國顧客。</p>
<p>在這些小咖啡館中，以"Little"為名的，在大華大戲院對面有一家，最為大家所熟悉，由於地段好，生意也很不錯，其餘在亞　培路也有一家呌做"Little"。而比較生疏的是國泰大戲院對面的那家Little　Cafe　Shop。</p>
<p>這家的位置在霞飛路上，坐南朝北「門面」，說它「門面」其實很不恰當，實際祗有一個小小的進口，還放了個香烟櫃台，對直便是條扶梯上樓，不是老顧客確是不易找到。</p>
<p>從扶梯上去，有兩扇門，會使你不知何所適從，當你注意到門上的招牌，推門進去又不見一人，原來還得轉一個灣才到。靠這點曲折有緻，很會今人感到興趣的。</p>
<p>當經過這些轉灣抹角，覺得豁然開朗時，有三間門面的一間咖啡室顯在眼前，段置說是怎樣做美倒不見得，可是色彩佷調和。記得在過去，地方好像還大一點，現在縮小範圍了。但在這裏你很可以避免一些不願碰到的熟朋友，讓你獨自去消磨一個靜靜的下午，或寂寞的夜晚，因為這兒中國人去的並不多。</p>
<p>若是你喜歡惡作劇，還可以約個朋友到那裏找你，到時候，你可以憑窗看他找不到的神情。</p>
<p>室內的佈置，臨窗靠牆都是火車座，放得並不擠，座位也還適意，當咖啡的香味和雪茄的烟霧迷漫一室時。環顧四週，都是碧眼黃髪，頗令人生置身異國之感。</p>
<p>這兒咖啡並不貴，不過一千幾百塊，蛋糕却也不能算便宜，每件價格不同，約在七八千元左右一件。但這確是他們自己製的，味道很不錯。一共三四個羅宋女侍，除了應付顧客，還要應付另買蛋糕的主顧。</p>
<p>論營業並不太好，這樣才顯得清靜可愛，至少不會碰到一些高聲大嚷，高談行巿的俗客，「偷得浮生半日閑」，這是個還不錯的去處。</p>

<h3>「八千里路雲和月」</h3>
<p>— 馬高</p>
<p>這部片子不久就正式公映了，記者湊巧趕上了預映，看後深深地被它所感動，不僅是因它描寫了智識青年在這時代裏所身受的苦難，更因為它敘述的徐州突圍，長沙大捷，湘桂撤退這些抗戰中的大事件記者曾躬逢其盛，加之我也是演劇隊的一員親身經歷過來，格外感覺到親切。</p>
<p>這是無數人大時代的小人物獻身抗戰從事文化演戲工作的血淚史跡。作者用禮彬與玲玉這兩個人物貫穿了九年，自都巿到鄉村，而戰塲而陪都，以至於「慘勝」後復員上海為止，把他倆在九年的生活摘要地抽出了幾個物徵的階段，紀錄了他們周圍一些青年朋友的生活工作敎育的情形，也可以說它是一部「演戲隊史」。因此，就使人感到它旁枝雜葉過多，冗長而缺少了發揮人物的力量。假使說玲玉和禮彬之兩個角色的性格而凸出而生動的發展，感人的程度將更深　而沉重。</p>
<p>智識份子，最敏感也最勇敢，每一個時代的浪潮，他最先感受到，而且是最先不顧一切的投入，然而他也是很脆弱的，往往容易撤退。當然並不是說所有的智識份子都會撤退。像這片子裏所表現的一羣，他們不求聞達的堅守崗位，不為利慾所動。（直到現在演戲隊屹然存在就是最好的明證）但這幾年來，許多曾經勇敢地生活過來的朋友，在殘忍得現實磨折下，不僅生活方式起了變化，連過去那種心頭　往的思想和願望，都冷却了，漸漸地轉了一個大灣。那末這部片子將提供出你過去一些記憶的材料，說你面對着自己的軟弱，批判一下現在。</p>
<p>一面是荒淫無恥，一面是嚴肅工作，抗戰中除了那些增壇槍拼命的士兵以外，就要算這些憑良智埋頭工作的文化人的功勞最大。可是現在勝利之果落入誰手？八年來朝朝夜夜幻想着的勝利美景，已成一片怎樣影像？文化人仍舊過美煎熬的日子，這一切耐人深思。</p>
<p>這片子是値得為觀眾介紹的好片子，無論演技和導演攝影都很正派和下了一些功夫。史東山先生是有成就的著名嚴肅的電影工作者，有這樣的成功，是很合理想的。我們現在看了這片子，才覺得中國電影還不絕望，還不致於讓好萊塢的威力永遠佔有我們的巿塲。因為它遠不曾正式公映，僅此作為介紹。</p>

<h3>Chairman's Statement: Current Economic Difficulties are a Temporary Dislocation; Hope All People Recognize the Need and Work Together for Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Supreme National Defense Council passed the Emergency Economic Measures Plan on the morning of the 16th. Chairman Chiang issued a special statement on this, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Our country has undergone eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, and the national economy has suffered severe oppression and destruction by the enemy, which goes without saying. Therefore, after the victory, the government took recovery and construction as the most important tasks. However, to carry out recovery and construction, we must first achieve domestic peace and unity. Consequently, the first measure after the war was to hold political consultations to achieve peaceful unification. Our friendly nation, the United States, with a fair attitude, worked hard to mediate. More than a year has passed, and although the dawn of peace has occasionally appeared, the Communist Party stubbornly adheres to its views, does not implement the reorganization plan, and does not participate in the National Assembly. As a result, the government's policy of resolving political issues through political means could not be realized, and peace negotiations ultimately came to a standstill. The Communist Party's deliberate disruption of social order and implementation of actions to undermine national unity should bear the responsibility, which has also been clearly understood by our people. However, although the Communist Party refused to participate in the National Assembly and the National Government, the government, by virtue of its responsibilities, continued to strive for the implementation of democratic politics. The National Government will soon be reorganized. The urgent tasks ahead are to gather the nation's talents to decide on solutions and, in accordance with the Constitution and its implementation preparations, implement elections and complete party governance. In the National Government and various ministries and commissions, the committee members selected by various parties will be stipulated, and social figures will be invited to participate to strengthen the foundation of the government.</p>
<p>Communist Party's Disruption and Undermining of Peace Cause Current Economic Difficulties</p>
<p>The current problem in our country is not a problem of political parties, but in fact a problem of the development of democratic politics. This is the path that must be followed for nation-building and is related to the survival of our country. I sincerely hope that all compatriots across the country can dedicate their loyalty and sincerity, share the fate of the nation, unite as one, to save our country from its current difficulties and lay the foundation for nation-building.</p>
<p>At present, the economic situation in our country has reached a very serious juncture. Following the consumption of eight years of resistance against Japan and the destruction of Japanese aggression, the Communist Party has intensified its disturbances during the recovery period. Even during the period of mediation and negotiations, it constantly used force to expand its territory and never ceased its military actions. In various regions of North China and the three northeastern provinces, the areas where the Communist Party has entrenched itself have become even wider. Once occupied, they immediately establish their own regimes, issue banknotes, blockade the economy, and prevent the transportation of food and materials. In areas under the control of our government, the destruction of railways, transportation lines, and industrial and commercial enterprises is more thorough than during the Japanese occupation. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Our country has abundant coal reserves, which should meet domestic demand without shortage. However, due to the Communist Party's obstruction of transportation and destruction of mines, the production of various industries in our country last year could not fully supply domestic needs and had to be imported from abroad. Before the war, our country could fully supply itself with cotton and tobacco. However, last year, various provinces in the north suffered from repeated wars, resulting in reduced production. The raw materials needed by cotton and tobacco factories required imports amounting to as much as US$200 million. Our country is based on agriculture, but at present, the bulk of imported goods are agricultural products, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>From the above, we must be able to deeply understand that the current economic difficulties are due to the destruction suffered in the eight years of resistance against Japan, as well as the Communist Party's disruption of the country and undermining of peace in the past year.</p>
<p>To Resolve the National Economic Crisis, Ten Emergency Measures are Decided</p>
<p>In the past year, the government has been very generous in handling foreign exchange. At the same time, wartime control policies have been abolished separately. This is because domestic industry and commerce lacked materials after the war and urgently needed to be replenished. Therefore, it was necessary to give industry and commerce the opportunity to develop freely. However, as the domestic economic situation became increasingly serious due to the Communist Party's disruption and the obstacles to national peace and unity, in order to adapt to the current environment and resolve the national economic crisis, the government had to comprehensively re-examine its economic policies and decided to take the following emergency measures: (1) The government's use of all foreign exchange and gold should be economized to prepare for the purchase of industrial raw materials and machinery, so that domestic production and transportation industries can continue to advance, and important daily necessities can also continue to be replenished. The exchange rate for settlement should be appropriately stipulated in accordance with the domestic and foreign currency purchasing power, so that it will no longer fluctuate. Therefore, starting from the 17th of this month, the exchange rate will be changed to 12,000 yuan of national currency per US dollar for settlement. Although this new exchange rate is higher than the previous one, it does not exceed the domestic price level. (2) Banning the buying and selling of gold on the market and prohibiting the circulation and trading of foreign currency notes to curb speculation. At the same time, the Central Bank will fully supply legitimate and legal foreign exchange. (3) The government should do its best to relieve the oppression of high interest rates on agricultural and industrial production and provide relief to agriculture and industry through loans or other means to support their development. (4) Government expenditures should be reduced to the greatest extent possible. All unnecessary new construction in this year's budget will be postponed. (5) Because our country has not yet widely implemented modern accounting systems, the collection of income tax and various direct taxes has not been significantly effective. Now, we should not seek precision in calculation, which would lead to prolonged delays, but should adopt rapid and effective collection methods. If this may increase the burden on individuals, in order to unanimously support the government to achieve economic stability, all our compatriots should recognize that this is indeed the way to increase national income and balance national revenue and expenditure, and should unanimously comply with it. (6) Various public utilities, if the government continues to subsidize them, the budget cannot be maintained. Therefore, reasonable increases should be made in the future. (7) The wages of laborers, based on pre-war prices, have actually increased several times, which is much better than the treatment of public educators and soldiers. The government will also use its foreign exchange to supply factories with raw materials for use, so that laborers can continue to work without fear of unemployment. The government has no intention of reducing the reasonable remuneration that laborers should receive, but also hopes that laborers will prioritize the general welfare of the public and express their patriotic spirit in unity with those who serve in other parts of society and the country, working hard and maintaining production. Future wage increases should be set at a maximum limit and should not be unrestricted, which would hinder the survival and development of industry. (8) Various state-owned enterprises that do not fall within the scope of heavy industry should be put up for auction or issue shares for public sale. (9) For a very small number of major daily necessities for people's livelihoods, such as rice, flour, cloth, coal, and edible oil, strict controls should be imposed. Those who violate control laws and engage in illegal activities such as speculation and hoarding will be severely punished. (10) Many commercial banks were newly established during the Anti-Japanese War, and some of them have engaged in speculative activities. The Ministry of Finance should strictly supervise and investigate them and punish them according to law.</p>
<p>Vigorously Carry Out Recovery and Construction; Cotton Production is Expected to be Self-Sufficient</p>
<p>In short, in the past year, although the Communist Party has done its best to destroy the economy, our government has still been working tirelessly to carry out various recovery and construction projects, and has made significant progress that is enough to comfort the people. Taking transportation as an example, at the beginning of last year, the railways under the control of our government were 7,845 kilometers. Although they were frequently attacked and destroyed by the Communist Party, the railways that can now be used for transportation have reached 11,887 kilometers, an increase of 50 percent. In terms of transport ships, before the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to foreign merchant ships, our country had a total of 570,000 tons of transport ships. At the end of the war, only 314,835 tons remained. Recently, it has reached 692,071 tons. In terms of production, last year, 960,000 bales of cotton yarn, several thousand tons of steel, 1,171,155 kilowatts of electricity, 300,000 tons of cement, and 13 million tons of coal were produced. This year, it is estimated that 2,379,000 bales of cotton yarn, 200,000 tons of steel, 1,638,500 kilowatts of electricity, 900,000 tons of cement, and 23 million tons of coal can be produced. The above-mentioned production figures are small compared to industrialized countries, but it is not easy to achieve these results given the various difficulties and obstacles last year. In terms of agriculture, this year, the cotton and tobacco imported from abroad account for 77.5 percent of the required quantity. It is expected that after this year's harvest season, our country may be able to supply 75 percent of cotton on its own. If we can intensify our efforts and expand production, it will not be difficult to achieve the hope of complete self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Export trade has also been actively promoted. Goods such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, soybeans, eggs, tea, minerals, and oils have been exported to foreign countries. In addition, Taiwan Province is a region that produces sugar, tea, camphor, and rice. During the period when it was occupied by Japanese invaders, the annual trade surplus could reach US$250 million. Now that this rich area has also been recovered, trade will definitely increase in the future.</p>
<p>Our Country's Measures for Self-Reliance; Hope for Sympathy and Understanding from Friendly Nations</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to state to my compatriots is that although there are many current economic difficulties, there is no reason to be afraid. The reasons for the current economic difficulties in our country are all temporary dislocations, and the economic abnormalities are only limited to certain cities. In fact, the basic factors of agriculture and industry are originally sound. As long as all compatriots from all walks of life across the country can make resolute efforts in their work positions, help each other, cooperate closely, and closely coordinate, we will be able to overcome the current crisis. We should all remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, we also overcame the unprecedented and more serious crisis imposed on our country by Japanese aggression with the same determination and effort. If we can continue to uphold this spirit of perseverance, recognize the needs of the country, fulfill the obligations of the people, and move forward towards the path of nation-building with one heart and one mind, we will be able to achieve democratic politics and restore the normal state of our country's economy. This is where the government's responsibilities lie, and it is also what the country's bright future depends on. I especially hope that friendly nations will recognize that our country's measures to restore economic stability and self-reliance are aimed at achieving prosperity in world trade and contributing to world peace, and give them sympathy and understanding.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Representatives and Senators Remaining in Shanghai Suggest Seven Points in a Telegram to the Chairman; the Current Crisis Depends on the Chairman's Virtue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai National Assembly Representatives Association and the National Senators Association held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon from 3:00 to 6:00 at the Shanghai Office of the Senators on Jianguo West Road. There was a heated discussion on the current issues of reorganizing the government, stabilizing finance, and promoting party and government affairs. When the attendees spoke in a somber tone about the gold and banknote rush, they unanimously believed that it was the result of financial and fiscal mismanagement. Yesterday's meeting was chaired by Senator Jiang Yong. The National Assembly representatives and senators remaining in Shanghai who attended the meeting included Hu Lin, Zhu Fengwei, Zhu Huiqing, Hu Jianzhong, Hu Qiuyuan, Chen Xiaowei, Wang Qizhang, Tan Guang, Wu Wentian, Xi Yu, Jin Zhenyu, Ruan Yicheng, Zheng Kuiyi, He Yuanming, Jiang Yiping, Wang Xiaolai, Ping Dingmou, Zhou Feicheng, Wu Luochu, Jiang Jianbai, Duanmu Kai, Wen Shouquan, Li Hongyuan, Pan Lianru, Chen Qitian, Su, Dai Tianchou, Ding Zhixiang, and more than 20 others. During the meeting, seven points of opinion were drafted and telegraphed to Chairman Chiang for adoption. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: More than 50 days have passed since the closing of the National Assembly, and the reorganization of the government has not yet been realized. The people's hopes have gradually faded away with the passage of time. Recently, the gold rush has surged, prices have soared, and the people's livelihoods have been plunged into despair. People are panicking, as if the end is near. However, the administrative authorities, although holding meetings constantly, have repeatedly declared that they will soon announce their plans. However, financial and fiscal mismanagement has been going on for a long time, and the use of gold has been a mistake again and again. Since Mr. Song Ziwen took charge of the Executive Yuan, he has concentrated the power of finance and taxation in his hands. Initially, he arbitrarily increased the salt tax, eroding the common people. Then, he forced a deduction of 40% of gold reserve certificates and used legal tender to redeem US dollar bonds, seeking petty gains and losing national credibility. The foundation of finance has been destroyed invisibly. After the victory, he did not urgently seek to support production and restore export trade to earn foreign exchange. He wanted to rely solely on the surplus materials of friendly nations to stabilize prices and rely on borrowing foreign debts to maintain the balance of payments. The state-owned enterprises he handled repeatedly led price increases in an attempt to increase revenue, but he did not know that stimulating prices would only lead to the adverse consequence of increasing national treasury expenditures. Various calculations have failed one after another. If personnel policies and systems are not changed at present, any stopgap measures, even if effective, can only temporarily stop the boiling. Inflation continues, and everyone is in danger. The remaining foreign exchange and gold will eventually run out. Furthermore, the military situation is urgent, and the political situation is murky. Looking to the future, how can we not be in danger? After unanimous discussion, the colleagues hereby propose: (1) Reorganize the government as soon as possible and attract talents, adhering to the principle of selecting only the virtuous and capable, without being limited by party affiliation, to give the people a fresh start; (2) Establish a democratic political system and increase the powers of popular and legislative bodies during the transition period, such as the Senate and the Legislative Yuan, so as to achieve the effect of supervision and review; (3) Investigate the responsibility of the highest responsible person for financial and fiscal mismanagement, rectify discipline, and regain the people's trust; (4) Re-establish economic, financial, and gold policies, prohibit the trading of US dollars in the market, and restore government credit as soon as possible to implement public debt policies to make up for issuance; (5) Thoroughly investigate the major manipulators of this gold rush. Please send senior officials from the Central Government to work with the Senate, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Procuratorate of the Court to investigate the exchange slips of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank and the traces of large amounts of cash coming and going, so as to clarify the truth and impose sanctions; (6) Establish a Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association as soon as possible to promote various preparatory works for the implementation of the constitution; (7) In accordance with the various election laws and regulations drafted based on the Constitution, please publish the draft proposals in advance, so that all parties have the opportunity to participate or contribute opinions, so as to conform to the spirit of democracy. Your Excellency led the resistance against Japan and made contributions to the country. Today's crisis still depends on your virtue to support it. The whole people admire your hard work day and night. The colleagues witness the urgency of the crisis and dare not hide it. We hereby respectfully telegraph this to you, hoping for your wise judgment and decisiveness. The country is fortunate, the National Assembly representatives, the National Senators.</p>

It is expected that the government will officially announce it in the shortest possible time. As for Mr. Zhang Junli, he has decided to go to India to participate in the Asian Association due to three invitations from Nehru, so he does not plan to go to Nanjing at present.</p>

<h3>Regarding Laws for Constitutional Implementation: National Defense Council to Discuss Later; Wang Chonghui Talks to Reporters About Drafting Process</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] The ten laws and regulations related to constitutional implementation, drafted by Wang Chonghui, were originally scheduled for discussion at the National Assembly's temporary meeting on the 16th. Due to time constraints, they will be discussed at the regular meeting on the 19th instead.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] The Legislative Committee of the Control Yuan is scheduled to reconvene on the morning of the 17th to discuss issues related to the Organic Law of the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] This reporter recently visited Mr. Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, who described the process of drafting the various laws and regulations related to constitutional implementation as follows: After the closing of the National Assembly, Mr. Wang began this drafting work on January 3 of this year, assisted by a drafting committee composed of eleven people. The first law drafted was the Procedural Law for the Exercise of Powers by the National Assembly, followed by the Organic Laws of the Five Yuan of the National Government. According to Mr. Wang, any discrepancies between the current Organic Laws of the Five Yuan and the Constitution have been amended in the new Organic Laws. Next were the Election and Recall Law for National Assembly Representatives, and the Election and Recall Law for the President and Vice President. The number of National Assembly representatives is set at 2,500 or more. Mr. Wang also stated that, according to the National Assembly's resolution, the election law and organic law must be promulgated before the end of March. The number of members of the Legislative Yuan will be expanded soon, and then these new laws will be reviewed. The detailed content will be announced only after the five principles on which the laws are based have been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council. However, when drafting the laws, the focus was on ensuring that all parties and factions could freely compete in the elections, with no provisions favoring any particular party. The new laws have two characteristics: First, the election law stipulates that a secret ballot system must be adopted to absolutely guarantee freedom of will. Voters do not need to sign their names; otherwise, the ballot is invalid. Second, the election procedures are subject to open scrutiny, including voter registration, candidate registration, voting, and vote counting.</p>

When meeting with reporters, Minister Chen only mentioned that the discussions took place in a friendly atmosphere and touched upon various urgent issues between the two countries. Philippine sources informed reporters that negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty are expected to resume in the near future and be discussed in a concrete manner because the Philippine side has hinted at a desire to reconsider the draft Sino-Philippine Treaty. The draft treaty was submitted last week by Philippine negotiators, but the Chinese representatives considered it unacceptable because it revoked all clauses previously agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Hanoi's Chinese-Vietnamese District to Undertake Third Evacuation</h3>

Our government has requested that the French and Vietnamese armies not engage in combat in the area. So far, fortunately, there has been no fighting there, so the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese have not been severe. Our Consul-General in Hanoi will take various steps to carry out the third evacuation of overseas Chinese from the district. However, this is not the most important issue for the overseas Chinese; their greatest difficulty at present is the lack of food and the recovery of business.</p>

The National Army is following closely in pursuit. On the 14th, they arrived at a point ten li south of Cao County. The Communist troops were routed at the mere sight of them and did not dare to engage in battle.

Therefore, anti-war sentiments are rising within their ranks, and the pro-surrender faction is gaining influence. There were no major changes in the battle situation in southwestern Shandong today. The National Army is strengthening pacification efforts in the area between Dingtao, Chengwu, and Shan County. Small groups of Communist troops have been surrendering in succession in recent days.

<h3>Prohibition Conference of Eight Counties Including Suzhou and Wuxi Resolves to Intensify Efforts to Eliminate the Source of Opium and Narcotics</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch of the 16th] In Jiangsu Province, strict opium and narcotics prohibition requires all smokers to quit voluntarily before the end of March. Anyone caught after April 1 will be sentenced to death. The Second District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office specifically convened a Prohibition Conference of Eight Counties of the Second District on the afternoon of the 16th. The magistrates, civil affairs section chiefs of Wuxi, Wujiang, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Taicang, Wujin, Changshu, and Wu Counties, as well as Liu Yong, the Special Narcotics Prohibition Commissioner of the Ministry of Interior, and Chen Jixiong, the Supervisory Officer for Civil Affairs, attended the meeting, which was presided over by Commissioner Xu Baoguang. After delivering an opening address, Liu reported on the Shanghai's prohibition situation for the reference of the various counties, hoping that the county magistrates would tailor their efforts to local conditions and complete this mission. Chen Jixiong then delivered a speech, expressing his deep distress at the protection of smokers by local police bureaus, and sincerely admonished them to correct these malpractices and utilize the Baojia system to eliminate these problems as soon as possible. Finally, three resolutions were adopted: (1) The sources of opium and narcotics in the counties of the Second District are mostly imported from northern Jiangsu, Xuzhou, and northern Anhui, Bengbu. A request will be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Communications to conduct a thorough investigation, and each county will separately organize a joint military-police-civilian team to investigate and crack down on the matter locally. (2) In addition to the county budget, a separate budget for narcotics prohibition expenses will be prepared and submitted to the province for approval. (3) Before the general reporting period of April 1, opium and narcotics cases in the counties will still be transferred to the judiciary for trial. After April 1, a request will be made to stipulate that they be tried by military law to emphasize prohibition through punishment. Commissioner Liu will request instructions from the Ministry of Interior to make a decision. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai, Traitor, Fears Death; Heart Disease Becomes Hopeless</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] Since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal, the traitor Zhou Fohai has been extremely depressed, causing his original heart disease to recur. He relies on others for assistance in his diet and daily life. According to the physician's diagnosis, Zhou's condition has now entered a serious stage. If he is not treated soon, Zhou will either die from the execution or be held captive by the demon of disease. Furthermore, after the traitor Ding Mocun was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court in accordance with the law, Ding expressed his dissatisfaction and submitted a petition to the High Court requesting a retrial. It is learned that after accepting the case, the High Court has submitted Ding's entire file and petition to the Ministry of Justice for review.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Investigates Warehouses, Severely Punishes Hoarding and Manipulation</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters held a joint party-government-military meeting on the 14th, deeming the rise in commodity prices in the county inappropriate. It was resolved that various agencies would organize investigation teams to investigate the quantity of goods stored in each warehouse and the owners of the goods. Those found to be manipulating and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants will be severely punished by military law without leniency. At the same time, the county government, noting that the rise in various commodity prices has slowed slightly, but the prices of various businesses directly related to the general public have not fallen, specifically summoned representatives from the fresh noodles, cooked noodles, kerosene, charcoal, cigarettes, silverware, barber, boiled water, and silk cloth industries to issue warnings and adjust the prices of various goods. Violators will be immediately detained.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Government Has Released Its Measures</h3>
<p>The economic situation is too chaotic, and all parties are eagerly hoping that the government will come up with a solution. Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council passed emergency economic measures, and the chairman provided a detailed explanation, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>First, balancing the budget involves: A. Deferring non-urgent expenditures; B. Rectifying tax collection; C. Intensifying the auction of enemy and puppet property and surplus materials; D. Transferring state-owned production enterprises to private management through auction or the issuance of stocks.</p>
<p>Second, measures to stabilize the gold rush include: A. Prohibiting the buying and selling of gold; B. Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currencies; C. Adopting wartime regulations to control prices; D. Canceling export subsidies and import surcharges, and raising the official exchange rate for US dollars to 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above plan encompasses finance, taxes, gold, US dollars, prices, exchange rates, and state-owned enterprises, and principled decisions have also been made regarding the limit of maximum wages and the maintenance of production loans. Since the end of the war, the above is undoubtedly the most important economic measure that has been proposed, and is arguably the most pleasing to the people. This is because (1) eliminating superfluous expenses, (2) transferring state-owned enterprises, (3) prohibiting the buying and selling of gold, and (4) prohibiting the circulation of foreign currencies have become unanimous demands of public opinion, and many people have also been advocating for the formal adjustment of foreign exchange and the implementation of price controls. Therefore, many of the measures decided yesterday, while important in nature, did not include any new or unexpected proposals. We want to specifically point out the following:</p>
<p>(1) The cancellation of export subsidies and import surcharges is extremely appropriate. Although these measures are ostensibly not an adjustment of foreign exchange, they are actually a means of raising the exchange rate, leaving several loopholes. First, the implementation of subsidies displeases friendly nations. Second, overseas remittances cannot be attracted, and we passively watch them overflow elsewhere. Third, a 50% surcharge on the import value is not the same as a 50% increase in import tariffs. In the minds of most foreign merchants, this is far less palatable than adjusting the exchange rate. Therefore, the decisive and timely correction is a legitimate measure rather than a careless decision.</p>
<p>(2) Adopting wartime regulations to control prices, thereby cracking down on hoarding and speculation, is naturally beyond reproach in theory. Furthermore, the existing so-called economic reconnaissance network is far more sophisticated in terms of legal principles and procedures. However, the results of wartime controls cannot actually be called successful. Whether in the public or private sphere, most of the painful experiences are still fresh in our minds. Therefore, at the beginning of victory, all control measures were abolished altogether, and there were indeed unavoidable reasons for this. Now, although prices are rising and the market is chaotic, we have no choice but to return to this old path. However, in terms of personnel, methods, categories, and policies, we hope to learn from the painful experiences and find a more perfect approach, not just be satisfied with wartime regulations. The chairman has stated that only a very small number of essential items for people's livelihood, such as rice, flour, cloth, fuel coal, and cooking oil, will be strictly controlled. It can be seen that this is not a comprehensive control, and it can also be seen that the government is still very cautious in adopting controls. We earnestly hope that the handling agencies will understand this intention well, handle the matter carefully, and avoid adding countless unnecessary troubles and pains to merchants and the public who are already in dire straits.</p>
<p>(3) Cutting unnecessary expenditures to balance the budget seems to be a routine platitude, but it is actually the most essential measure at present. As everyone knows, the various fluctuations in the economy are directly or indirectly related to inflation. The reason for inflation is simply that income does not meet expenditure, and we have no choice but to rely on issuing banknotes as a means of making up the difference. Therefore, if all extravagant expenditures can be drastically eliminated, then income and expenditure can gradually balance, new banknotes can be stopped from being issued, floating capital can gradually decrease, prices can stabilize, wages will not be increased again, interest rates will also return to normal, and unscrupulous merchants will no longer be able to display their skills on a grand scale. The problem is that fiscal affairs are too fragmented. Whether at the central or local level, all agencies rely on their subjective views, make eloquent arguments, and demand excessive amounts, so that all expenses become necessary in their eyes. For example, the city's budget has yet to be compiled and is still under discussion and review. This is because all expenses are deemed necessary by those in charge. Therefore, to defer or reduce non-urgent expenditures, the officials who coordinate the overall situation must make a firm decision to first suspend or abolish such non-urgent agencies and undertakings in order to achieve results.</p>
<p>Finally, we must say a few more words to the general merchants and public: The government's measures have already been released. To ensure that these measures are effective, on the one hand, the implementing agencies must first have confidence, conscientiously handle affairs, and properly implement the plan to ensure its thorough implementation. On the other hand, all relevant people must sincerely cooperate and not engage in tangible or intangible disruption and destruction. In particular, (1) if the public is unwilling to cooperate with price controls, it will not be completely satisfactory to rely solely on the police force to investigate and punish. (2) A few days ago, export subsidies were implemented, and the purpose was naturally to promote exports. However, unscrupulous hoarding merchants blindly raised prices, increasing the price of goods by more than double in just a few days, so that the effectiveness of government subsidies was completely offset. This time, the exchange rate has been adjusted to US$11,000 to one, and the export exchange rate is equivalent to doubling again (calculated at 3,350, it is equivalent to tripling). If we can make good use of this cost, the sales of export goods do not seem difficult to activate. It is hoped that everyone will broaden their horizons and follow the Chairman's instructions: Let us all work together to save our country from its current difficulties.</p>
<h3>Instability in Southern Wujin; Bandits Repeatedly Carry Out Assassinations</h3>
<p>Changtai Jia Establishes Anti-Bandit Command Headquarters</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch] The sixth, seventh, and eighth districts south of the county seat are unstable, and assassinations have occurred repeatedly. In the past week alone, there have been two more incidents. One victim was Chu Bingsheng, the head of the seventh Bao of Mingfeng Town in the seventh district, who was kidnapped and killed by the local bandit leader Zhou Bida, who personally led more than ten accomplices, at Sanfentou in Heliu Wilderness on the evening of the twelfth. Another victim was Jiang Guozhen, the head of the tenth household of the eighth Jia of the second Bao of Lingtai Township, and his wife, Ms. Wang, who were assassinated in the same way on the evening of the eighth.</p>
<p>[Changshu Dispatch] In order to establish local security, Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading counties have organized an Anti-Bandit Command Headquarters, with Su Zhaogeng, the head of the Youth Corps, concurrently serving as the commander. The county magistrates, military section chiefs, and Chief Cai of the police bureau will each serve as deputy commanders. Once the deployment is complete, it will be established immediately.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Requests the Ministry of Food to Adjust Grain Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch] The Ministry of Food purchased a total of 600,000 Shi of grain in Anhui Province this year, setting the county grain price at 15,000 yuan per Shi. However, the grain prices in various counties have now risen significantly. Grain prices in the Chao-He area have risen to 60,000 yuan per Shi, and other counties are also close to this figure. Since the main income of the various counties is the land tax in the form of public grain, the lower the grain price, the more difficult it is to balance the budgets of the various counties. The Anhui Provincial Government has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Food requesting that it determine the purchase price according to the market price in two-month periods in order to increase the income of the various counties and reduce local difficulties.</p>

<h3>Pan-American Defense Committee Suggests Western Hemisphere Implement Joint Defense, Standardize Military Training and Equipment, Another Important Plan Following US-Canada Military Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The Pan-American Defense Committee has suggested to the American republics that weapons and equipment, as well as the training of the Western Hemisphere's land, sea, and air forces, be standardized. It also advocates establishing a military committee to promote closer cooperation in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Using forward bases for naval and air forces, the committee proposes adopting a "blitzkrieg" long-range defense principle and exchanging army, navy, and air force officers. The members of the Pan-American Defense Committee are the army, navy, and air force representatives from the twenty-one American nations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] The Pan-American Defense Committee today announced a plan stipulating that the standardized land, sea, and air forces of the Americas should swiftly repel any attacker of the Western Hemisphere. Standardization of armaments and training is the key point of the plan. For example, Brazilian artillery batteries could use American shells, or the same essential parts could be fitted to patrol bombers from more than ten countries, and strategies would also converge. The plan calls for Latin American countries to re-equip their forces with American-style equipment, similar to the US-Canada joint defense agreement announced last week. The US and Canada have announced that they have agreed on a plan for wartime military cooperation and the exchange of post-war intelligence. The British government has also indicated that it intends to follow the path adopted by the United States for future defense equipment.</p>
<h3>US Actively Develops Arctic Region</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Moscow has accused the United States of attempting to turn the Arctic region into a "stronghold of imperialist conspiracies." Senior US military authorities have also not concealed their concern about the Arctic region. However, diplomatic and military officials here today repeatedly emphasized that the United States' concern for the Arctic region is by no means aggressive. Most officials agree with Air Force Commander Spaatz's view that "all industrialized countries are within the range of American aircraft, and conversely, the United States is also within the range of other countries, so in fact, the airspace above the United States is absolutely open." Therefore, military leaders are strongly advocating the establishment of weather stations and observation posts in the Arctic region. According to the recently announced US-Canada defense agreement, the two countries should exchange all information on common defense, including information on the Arctic region, as well as new equipment and supplies for the military.</p>
<h3>Collective Security Still Difficult to Achieve, US Secretary of War Strongly Advocates Maintaining Military Strength</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Philadelphia, 15th] US Secretary of War Patterson, speaking at Temple University, stated that while people have optimistic calculations for 1947, believing they can rest easy, the collective security maintained by a world peace organization does not yet exist. This is an undeniable fact. Our country's security still depends on our resources. We are still in a world that relies solely on power. The fundamental problem for the United States is to achieve stability and lasting peace. I firmly believe that our best guarantee for preventing a new war disaster is to maintain military strength. Even if the United States wins in a new war, the economic organization of the United States may still collapse as a result, because the financial burden imposed on the country by war is extremely heavy. Regarding the issue of disarmament, one point must be noted: as long as Germany and Japan have the opportunity to restore their aggressive habits, we cannot consider the issue of disarmament for even a day. When we formulate any disarmament plan, we must pay attention to two points: (1) The disarmament plan must be followed by a clear agreement on a control system to ensure that the agreement is not violated. (2) Any disarmament plan aimed at avoiding war should not only prohibit "weapons of mass destruction," but should also limit the strength of the military, including the police, because the police can quickly be reorganized into the military. We should fully support the United Nations organization and disarmament, but in this nebulous period when the war has just ended and peace has not yet arrived, the world still weighs the importance of each country's pronouncements based on its military strength. Therefore, we must maintain our own security, which remains a fact, and we will insist on the policy of retaining considerable military strength.</p>
<h3>British Political Circles' Views on French-Czech Negotiations, Believing French Policy is Returning to its Old Ways</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Political figures here are deeply interested in the news announced yesterday in Paris that France and Czechoslovakia are about to begin negotiations to revise the treaty between the two countries to suit the modern situation. France, Britain, and Czechoslovakia have different opinions on the German question. While France is negotiating a treaty with Britain, it is also announcing its intention to negotiate with Czechoslovakia, indicating that France may raise the German question in its negotiations with these two countries. At the same time, it also has considerable domestic implications. Some people in France were dissatisfied with the Anglo-French alliance, considering it a pro-British expression by France. Now that they see that France is also about to start with Eastern Europe, their doubts can be slightly reduced. France's future foreign policy seems to be returning to the style before and after liberation, using itself as a bridge between East and West. Britain's policy is to establish multilateral alliances within the scope of not harming the responsibilities between major Allied countries, and it is expected that it will welcome the French-Czech negotiations.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Denies Building Atomic Fission Plant</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet "Time Weekly" published today accused US Senator McMahon's recent remarks, saying that the Soviet Union is building an atomic fission plant behind the Ural Mountains, are purely nonsense.</p>
<h3>Australian Demobilization Ends</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Sydney, 15th] Officials have announced that demobilization work within Australia has ended, with a total of 550,000 soldiers demobilized after the war. Currently, the Australian Air Force has 12,000 personnel, the Army 40,000, and the Navy 12,000.</p>
<h3>To Cope with Domestic Coal Famine Crisis, There is Talk that the British King May Return Home Early, Smuts Has Not Heard About This</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cape Town, 15th] Marshal Smuts told United Press reporters today: I have not heard of rumors that King George will return home after arriving in South Africa to deal with the domestic crisis, and I do not think it is likely. Senior South African government officials believe that unless there is an extremely urgent situation, it will not prompt the King to return home. A certain newspaper run by the South African National Party took the lead today in describing this matter in huge proportions on the front page and in the political news column, saying that in this dark period, the King himself will undoubtedly be willing to fulfill his duties. The luxury enjoyed by the royal family in South Africa will be in sharp contrast to the hardships of the British people, and the communication reports on the royal family's travels will have the most unfavorable impact on the British people, or may lead to serious political developments, which is also unknown. If the King can quickly return to his country in times of emergency, and let the Queen and Princess, or just the Princess, continue the trip, it will not only have a major impact on the British people, but also on the South African people.</p>

<p>Fuel Panic Has a Major Impact</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] The reputation of the Labor government has apparently been greatly damaged by the fuel panic. General opinion is critical of the government for not warning the people before announcing the power outage measures. The power outage measures obviously have a serious impact on the government's original economic and industrial plans. The goal of exceeding 75% of pre-war exports seems to be unattainable, and Chancellor Dalton's budget will inevitably be changed as a result. The political repercussions are also significant, with the Conservative Party and Conservative newspapers taking this opportunity to launch a major attack on the government. However, the 400 Labor MPs have instead formed an even more determined front to support the government, and trade unions have also mostly supported the government and expressed sympathy for Shinwell, who is the target of public criticism. Therefore, it is expected that the Labor government will not collapse.</p>
<h3>Attlee Denies Coalition Government Rumors</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: Rumors that Britain will form a coalition government, British Prime Minister Attlee today solemnly denied, claiming that this is absolutely nonsense.</p>
<h3>Holding German-Austrian Peace Conference, We Should Be an Invited Country, Actively Striving Based on the Potsdam Agreement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th] According to political circles here, regarding the issue of German-Austrian peace talks and the convening of a German-Austrian peace conference, our government has sent a note to the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, believing that (1) according to the Potsdam Agreement and the precedent set by the signing of peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland, the entire process related to German-Austrian peace negotiations should first be negotiated and decided by the five foreign ministers of the Foreign Ministers' Conference; (2) the convening and organization of the German-Austrian peace conference should be jointly agreed upon by the five countries; (3) the agenda of this Foreign Ministers' Conference of the United States, Britain, and Scotland should be limited to the drafting of the German-Austrian peace treaties. If there are any changes, the consent of China should be obtained. According to news from Nanjing, the United States and France have already given formal replies, agreeing with China's position. The British side has not yet replied, but the British Foreign Minister previously expressed to our Foreign Minister in Paris and New York that he agreed with China's position, and his reply is expected to be sent out soon. It is also heard that only the Soviet Union's reply opposed China's position on the issue of convening the peace conference, but our government is still continuing serious negotiations. The reason is that our country's position is entirely in line with the Potsdam Agreement. If the signatory countries have different views on the agreement, the views of the minority or one country cannot be taken as the standard.</p>
<h3>Greece Strictly on Guard, Orders Prohibition of Public Gatherings</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 15th] After Greek Public Security Minister Tsakalotos reiterated the order prohibiting public gatherings, the police headquarters announced tonight that the mass rally scheduled to be held on Sunday by the left-wing groups and the Communist Party would be prohibited. The army was also ordered to stay in camp from tonight, not allowed to go out, in order to cope with any possible incidents.</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the Greek Investigation Team Will Move to Thessaloniki</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 15th] The United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee decided today to move its headquarters from Athens to Thessaloniki, and the relocation can begin next Wednesday or Thursday. At the same time, the special team of the committee will begin inspecting worthy of investigation places around Athens starting Monday, and then submit a report to the headquarters in Thessaloniki. The committee also decided that representatives from Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania should not exceed one hour each time they present their views, and representatives from the Greek left-wing Liberation Front are allowed to present their views within two hours.</p>
<h3>Envoy Wu Jingxiong Presents Credentials to the Pope</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vatican City, 16th] The new Chinese ambassador to the Holy See, Wu Jingxiong, paid a visit to the Pope today to present his credentials, with a solemn ceremony. The ambassador delivered a speech in English, stating that the Chinese people have suffered deeply and realize the greatness of Christ's spirit of universal love. The Pope also replied in English, praising the ambassador's important mission and the achievements of the Chinese people in their revival. After the ceremony, the Pope also had a private conversation with Ambassador Wu.</p>
<h3>Bevin Elaborates on British Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin spoke at a private meeting of five hundred Labor representatives.</p>
<p>British Troops to Withdraw from Greece Soon</p>
<p>He said that all British troops stationed in Greece would withdraw within ninety days from March 1st. Britain plans to establish joint commissions with several other countries, similar to the Anglo-French Committee, to discuss economic cooperation. The meeting lasted nearly three hours, and Bevin answered questions raised by the representatives. His speech first reviewed general diplomatic issues, saying that Britain's coal crisis also hinders its foreign policy. Other countries hope to obtain British coal loans and goods, but Britain cannot supply them for the time being, so foreign policy must be formulated based on this situation. He then mentioned the recent peace treaty discussions, and said that Britain intends to improve the alliance treaty signed with the Soviet Union and conclude an alliance with France.</p>
<p>Hoping for a Federal Germany</p>
<p>Regarding the future of Germany, it is hoped that there will be a federal political system, so that the states have strong powers, and not to concentrate power too much in the central institution. He said that the Soviet Union seems to want a centralized German authority, and the reason for this is not yet clear. It is hoped that it can be explored at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Speaking of the general issue of peace and security, he does not believe that any country still wants war. Disarmament is necessary, but it must be implemented after the collective security system is established. He will try to establish international trust in the Moscow Conference, so that the collective security system can be established.</p>
<h3>Acheson Expresses Anti-Soviet Remarks, Soviet Union Lodges Protest with the United States, Acheson Once Stated the Aggressive Nature of Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] A broadcast station here recently issued a message saying that when the US Senate held a meeting yesterday to discuss the appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Democratic Senator McKellar asked Undersecretary of State Acheson: Does he believe that if the Soviet Union possesses the atomic bomb, it will conquer Europe and the entire world? Acheson immediately replied: The current policy of the Soviet Union is indeed a policy of aggression and territorial expansion. The United Press and other newspapers have carried these remarks. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today sent a note to the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, protesting Acheson's anti-Soviet remarks, and asked US Ambassador Lieutenant General Smith to forward the note to the US government.</p>
<h3>Five US Soldiers in Tokyo Commit Murder after Drunkenness, Killing Five Japanese People, Injuring Twenty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to the US Far East Air Force today, five crazy soldiers from the Fifth Air Force killed five Japanese people and injured twenty in Hachijojima Town, west of Tokyo. The five soldiers will be tried by a military court for murder. It is also said that the five soldiers are now imprisoned in the Eighth Army barracks, and the reason for their madness was caused by drinking.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Reparations Plan, US Submits to the Far East Commission for Discussion, Wider Scale than the Pauley Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, according to responsible parties here, the United States has drafted a plan to immediately distribute 30% of the total amount of Japanese reparations to the eleven countries concerned, and has submitted it to the Allied Far East Commission for discussion. France and the Soviet Union are also among these eleven countries, and they are currently studying the plan proposed by the United States. The Pauley Commission, President Truman's reparations commissioner, initially submitted a Japanese reparations plan to the State Department, making Japanese industry return to the level of 1928. All Japanese war industries, large-scale steel industries, hydroelectric plants, and other major industries must not exist, and all materials will be used for reparations. However, after careful study by the State Department, it was unanimously believed that the Pauley Plan would reduce the living standards of the Japanese people, so it was decided to revise it, making Japanese industry restore to the level of 1932. The Allied Far East Commission also issued a document proposing to allow Japanese industry to maintain its 1932-34 benchmark. In addition, it is still impossible to ascertain the attitude of the Soviet government on this matter. Some people are deeply afraid that the Soviet Union's opinion is that the United States may delay the distribution of Japanese reparations in order to avoid the economic collapse of Japan.</p>

<p>First, France has lost her most basic national sovereignty, that is, the ability to protect her borders. The Maginot Line was originally just a paper tiger, but now even this paper tiger is gone. In history, there is no precedent for a country to fall from the status of a first-class country to the status of a third-class country without experiencing drastic changes in its social life and national character. Greece rose again after its decline, while Rome never recovered. Which direction French civilization will follow is still unknown at this moment, because the actual changes must pass through the people's consciousness, which cannot be seen at present.</p>
<p>What France urgently needs at present is a kind of spiritual retreat; she needs several years of peace and quiet in order to reconsider her various problems and reassess her new values. But this is impossible, partly because of the economic situation, but mostly because of the second basic fact, that the most numerous party in France today openly pledges allegiance to a foreign country whose doctrine and traditional ideology are completely different. For two thousand years, it has been a bastion of Latin traditional ideology, but now it has been transformed into an outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire's power. Regardless of whether Stalin's regime is good or bad, if France falls into the sphere of influence of a party supported by China or Mexico, her position is equally miserable.</p>
<p>The third basic fact is that the sovereignty within France has also been lost; that is to say, the heads of the French administration no longer hold the real power to control the country. To put it more specifically, the French government will not be able to sustain the general strike of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) controlled by the Communist Party for more than a few days before it has to collapse.</p>
<p>The Real Power of the French Trade Union</p>
<p>Readers must know that the general strike in France is not the same as the general strike of the American trade union and the partial strikes of elevator workers, dock workers, or miners. Under the current situation, the meaning of the general strike in France is like this: As soon as the order of the CGT is issued, the country's water, electricity, and gas are immediately cut off, firemen, subways, and buses immediately stop running, telephones and telegrams are immediately cut off, and the postal service immediately stops. Urban residents will have to starve, and all life will be suspended, falling into the sleeping beauty's posture.</p>
<p>Among the trump cards held by the French Communist Party, the control of the French CGT is only one, although it may be the most important one. The Communist Party's five million voters, its open declarations, and its presence in the National Assembly are only superficial fronts for an underground work of a revolutionary movement, which actually contains a tradition of conspiracy, a new philosophy of Machiavellianism, and the seizure of power.</p>
<p>Recently, there have often been cases of foreign refugees and even French people being sniped or kidnapped. They are mostly Communist Party members with disagreements, who used to hold fairly important Communist Party positions in large factories or rural areas, and are very familiar with the inside story of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Liberalism Bows Its Head</p>
<p>The real cases are probably less than five or six, but rumors often arise in factories and rural areas, exaggerating the facts, making party members gradually feel that even a basic party member, once suspected of betraying the party, the result will not only be denounced as a "Fascist instigator," but will also be regarded as a dangerous element. The effect of this intimidation is exactly the goal pursued by the Communist Party leaders: to subject the party cadres to absolute "Bolshevik training" and to eliminate the easygoing individualism of the French working class. Libertarianism should be replaced by a strict totalitarian class consciousness, and the Latin national spirit should be replaced by the spirit of the Eastern Roman Empire.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that these party purges and related illegal acts are all the work of the newly established FTP members. The FTP is an underground organization, small in number, probably only four or five hundred people in the whole of France. They are like a kind of communist Ku Klux Klan, only lacking a romantic personality.</p>
<p>The Strength of the Third Column</p>
<p>In addition to this means of intimidation, there is also a policy of infiltration into enemy territory. The achievements of the German Fifth Column's secret activities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France are not comparable to the capabilities of the French Third Column. The Third Column is the successor to the formally dissolved Third International. Its strength includes five million Communist Party voters, one hundred thousand trained party members, and it controls many important departments in the cabinet and many trade unions. If the Communist Party decides to launch a change, the government does not have much power to stop it. The trade unions are under their direct control, the police are secretly monitored by the Third Column, and the army is scattered in overseas colonies and within Germany. A certain Socialist Party representative once said: "If the Communist Party decides to take over the power of France, it only needs to make a few phone calls to succeed.</p>
<p>The Policies Taken by the Communist Party</p>
<p>However, the possibility of this is only a theory at present. A Communist Party coup would undoubtedly achieve initial and surprising success, but the dispersed opposition, for de Gaulle and the syndicalist factions, would soon unite and confront them, resulting in a civil war, followed by the intervention of foreign aid from both sides, forming a situation similar to Spain. This is what the Communist Party leaders are trying to avoid at present. Therefore, the Kremlin issued the following orders to the French Communist Party: Be moderate and steady, respond flexibly. Be prepared at all times. Seize all real power, wait for the opportunity, but do not act rashly, lest it cause difficult international disputes. (Translated from the New York Times Weekly)</p>

<h3>Intensifying the Investigation of the Gold Rush, Four Supervisory Committee Members are Sent to Shanghai, Supervisory Group to Start Work Today, Those Found to Have Manipulated the Market Will Be Tried According to Military Law</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] After the Economic Supervisory Group responsible for suppressing prices and eliminating speculation was officially established, yesterday was a regular weekly holiday. In addition to the active internal preparation work, there were no major external actions. The group will officially begin working in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on the fifth floor from today. All the staff are mixed compositions drawn from the Garrison Headquarters, Police Bureau, Municipal Government, 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, China Textile Company, etc. In order to avoid abuses, all staff members will be issued with case-handling certificates.

<h3>30,000 Prostitutes, Most Suffer from Venereal Diseases, Municipal Health Bureau Tries to Prevent Spread</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Before the prostitute problem can be completely resolved, it can only be remedied from the negative side, that is, to prevent the spread of venereal diseases. The Municipal Health Bureau Venereal Disease Prevention and Control Center was established in December of the 34th year. In addition to venereal disease prevention and control, its work also includes the examination of prostitutes entrusted by the Police Bureau. After the examination, those who are non-toxic are issued permits before they are allowed to operate. According to the center's statistics, a total of 3,550 prostitutes went to the center for examination in the past year, belonging to 809 brothels. Examination results: 58.3% of them suffered from syphilis, and 15% suffered from gonorrhea. There are also those who suffer from other venereal diseases. Therefore, only 1,345 of the 3,550 people were allowed to operate, accounting for 37.9%. 2,205 people were not allowed to operate, accounting for 62.1%. The total number of prostitutes in the city, including private prostitutes, is estimated to be about 30,000. The terrible nature of the spread of venereal diseases can be imagined from this.</p>
<p>Most prostitutes lack basic knowledge of hygiene. Of the 3,550 people, only one person went to the center for examination on a monthly basis. The police bureau and the health bureau then implemented a permit system, with the police bureau sending personnel to investigate. Those without permits were detained for one week. After this method was implemented, more prostitutes went to the Venereal Disease Prevention and Control Center for examination.</p>
<p>Of the 809 brothels, the Laozha District is the densest, with a total of 524, followed by Songshan District, Hongkou, and Xincheng District. Jiangning District has the fewest, with only one.</p>
<p>According to the center's Director Yu and Doctor Dong told reporters that in addition to the Venereal Disease Prevention and Control Center on Hefei Road and a branch on Tiantong Road, the Health Bureau plans to establish a venereal disease hospital, a venereal disease prevention and control branch, and many nighttime clinics this year. In addition, it plans to instill medical knowledge of venereal diseases to workers in various factory areas in order to prevent the spread of venereal diseases.</p>

<h3>Movie Theaters Implemented Price Increase Yesterday, Social Affairs Bureau Expresses Disagreement</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] When the city government reduced the entertainment tax on February 1, the city's cinemas automatically adjusted their ticket prices, reducing them by an average of about 10%. However, less than half a month later, they suddenly announced another adjustment, increasing them by about one time. It is reported that for this ticket price increase, the guild initially stipulated that the first-run tickets would be from 4,500 to 10,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the new price adjustment had not been half a month and could not be changed again, so it rejected it. However, this official document was sent to the guild twice, but it was returned because no one accepted it. At the same time, the guild has also held a meeting to discuss and re-stipulate the ticket price for first-run to be 4,000 to 7,000 yuan, resulting in a situation of rejection and self-rejection, price increase and self-price increase. However, according to the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, they cannot agree to the cinema's price increase this time and will still stop it.</p>
<h3>Price Increase, Trolleybuses and Buses May Increase Fares</h3>
<p>The British-owned Electric Military Company and the French-owned Trolleybus Company, and other public utilities in the city, recently submitted documents to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau requesting an increase in fares, increasing them by one time according to the current ones.

<h3>Our Women's Circles Highly Value Ms. Mao Yunqin Talks About European and American Women After the War Give Up Personal Enjoyment and Encourage Frugality</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The World YWCA Conference will be held in Hangzhou in October this year, and the Chinese YWCA attaches great importance to this grand meeting.

It is hoped that our Chinese representatives can contact representatives from various countries, exchange opinions, and hope that foreign representatives can inspect various parts of China after the meeting to truly understand the Chinese situation and promote various tasks together with our Chinese representatives.</p>
<p>Ms. Mao talked about the lives of foreign women after the war, which was quite moving. It is said that European and American housewives are gritting their teeth, tightening their belts, and temporarily giving up their personal enjoyment in order to directly or indirectly help the country recover. When she was in London for fifteen days, she only ate one egg. At the same time, because she did not have a ration card, she could not get soap, and hot water could not be used much because of the lack of fuel and electricity. British women, including those with property, are now self-employed in sewing, cooking, and other work. The same is true for Parisian women. Currently, there are not many women wearing the latest fashions strutting through the city. Women are wearing simple and old clothes, but they do not complain about this, but are proud of it, saying that they are willing to sacrifice everything for the revival of France.</p>
<p>Even American women in today's "golden country" are tightening their belts. On the one hand, they are seeking work to support themselves. Most college graduate girls, although they have to take care of their children and manage household chores, still go out to work. Most of them serve in the Red Cross, the YWCA, and other women's organizations. They are deeply proud of being able to participate in work.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Port Quarantine Office recently stipulated that from today, all passenger ships sailing to various ports on the Yangtze River and Ningbo and Wenzhou must anchor in Wusong for inspection when exporting.

(4) Ships sailing to other coastal ports and foreign countries will still be quarantined in the port. (5) Cargo ships and oil tankers (ships without passengers) are exempt from inspection, except that the crew members must be vaccinated and hold valid certificates.</p>
<h3>Ships Sailing in the Port Should Reduce Speed to the Minimum</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs recently notified shipowners: All ships sailing within the port area must abide by the various provisions of the Shanghai Port Management Ship Regulations. While avoiding danger to the ship itself, they should travel at the lowest speed at all times. If there is any violation of the above provisions, such as speeding, in addition to being punished according to regulations, they must also bear full responsibility for all damages.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement, Arson of Warehouse, Consequences of Soliciting Prostitutes, Fortunately No Major Disaster Occurred</h3>

<h3>Basketball Notes: Green Team Remains Women's Basketball Leader with Five Consecutive Wins</h3>
<p>In last night's opening women's basketball league match between the Green Team and the Youth League, it was a captivating game. The Youth League, as an emerging force, was expected to pose a threat to the Green Team. However, judging from the results of yesterday's game, the Green Team has not lost its status as the league leader, achieving five consecutive wins by overwhelmingly defeating the Youth League.</p>
<p>Sun Fengzhu of the Youth League has not retired and is regarded by others as the key to the Youth League's scoring. However, her performance yesterday was disappointing. She only made two out of seven free throws and scored only one field goal, totaling four points.</p>
<p>Li Huizhen of the Youth League is a defensive star, known for her agility and fondness for turnaround moves. However, she is relatively short and may have some nearsightedness; otherwise, she would be a headache for Huang Mingyuan.</p>
<p>Liu Zhenbao of the Green Team has been fortunate in recent games. Her layups and shots lack sophisticated form and the arched curve of Ah Yuan's one-handed layups. However, they are accurate. She scored 30 points last night, and in the match against the Women's Youth Red Team, she set a record by scoring 51 points.</p>
<p>In last night's second match between Morning Friends and Jia Shen, Jia Shen suffered from poor shooting, missing many shots. Zhu Zhonglin and Tao Yingshi need to improve their shooting skills. Huang Cunrui of Morning Friends, usually a long-range specialist, had a fruitless night. This might be a case of "shooting coldness."</p>
<p>In the final match, Railways Jing wore tank tops and shorts, fully geared up, while the All-Blacks wore fleece jackets and long pants, appearing nonchalant. Although they may seem like a disorganized group, they possess some strong skills. Jia Youliang, who returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, also played last night. Perhaps due to travel fatigue, he has not yet recovered, as his dashing power was not fully displayed. (German)</p>

<h3>Goods Shipped to Taiwan Province Must Be Approved by the Chief Executive's Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Taiwan Province returned to the motherland after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, shipping between Shanghai and Taiwan has been frequent. However, the currency system has not yet been reformed, and the Taiwan dollar is still the currency in circulation, with 30 legal tender yuan exchanged for 1 Taiwan dollar. Yesterday, the relevant commercial institutions in this city and Taiwan Province suddenly received a telegram from the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, informing them that goods shipped from this city to Taiwan Province in the future must be approved by the office before they can be imported; otherwise, unloading will not be allowed, and outbound goods must be combined with currency.</p>
<h3>Import of Foreign Goods Requires Consulate Visa</h3>
<p>Regarding the import of foreign goods into our country, the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee had previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informing our consulates abroad that the goods must be visaed by the consuls of the respective consulates. However, the certificates do not guarantee that the goods shipped by the merchants will be permitted upon import. The committee has now reported from various sources that some of our consulates abroad have not followed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegram order. The committee has specially sent another letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to immediately inform the consuls to pay attention.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Urges All Industries Not to Blindly Raise Prices</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce believes that the recent rise in gold prices has led to a rise in commodity prices, and the national economy and people's livelihoods are on the verge of collapse. It has issued a circular to all industry trade associations in the city, hoping to inform their member merchants not to blindly raise prices first. Even if there is a reason to raise prices, it must be based on legal profits, and there must not be excessive price increases to avoid public criticism and legal sanctions.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Apply for Loans to Purchase Large Quantities of Wheat</h3>
<p>Amid rising rice prices, flour prices have also soared. Five flour mills in this city, including Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, previously applied to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for a loan of 2 billion yuan in order to purchase domestic wheat from various regions and increase flour production, and Mayor Wu assisted in the process. It is now learned that the Four Banks Joint Treasury has approved the loan and will sign a contract in the coming days. In addition to the City Bank underwriting 10%, the rest will be handled by the four banks and two bureaus. The loan agreement will be formally signed in the coming days. Furthermore, the negotiated price of flour has not been adjusted since the municipal authorities last set it at 30,000 yuan per bag. However, the recent surge in black market flour prices will be thoroughly investigated in order to suppress prices and maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>U.S. Flour Export Prices</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, February 15th] The price of flour exported from the Gulf of Mexico is set at US$5.90 per hundred pounds, and the price of flour exported from the Atlantic coast is set at US$6.10 per hundred pounds. The price is US$1.4925 per U.S. dollar.</p>

<h3>Budget, Prices, Usury, and Fiscal Economy</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junzhang</p>
<p>(1) Starting with the Budget</p>
<p>The second month of the thirty-sixth year has already begun. Since the start of the thirty-sixth year, we have not had a single day free from the troubles of price fluctuations. The settlement at the end of the lunar new year, and the five-day commercial holiday, have greatly stimulated prices. Moreover, the recent wave of gold and cash price increases across the country has given prices a frightening and extremely concerning stimulus. These facts show that the fiscal economy has reached a critical juncture. We have always believed that after victory, China urgently needed to achieve only two things. These two things are: (1) political peace and unification, and (2) fiscal balance. Only peace and unification can stabilize society and bring solace to the people who have tasted suffering. Only fiscal balance can stop inflation and stabilize ever increasing prices. It has been almost a year and a half since the victory, and these two issues have not been resolved. This is truly a most distressing matter.</p>
<p>Now, the budget for the thirty-sixth year has been initially completed, and has been reviewed by the Senate and the Legislative Yuan. According to the original figures, revenue is more than seven trillion, and expenditure is more than nine trillion. Chief Accountant Xu Kan said that this is the budget with the smallest percentage difference between expenditure and revenue since the Anti-Japanese War. This is indeed a fact, and it is also a gratifying thing. The Senate and the Legislative Yuan have made more suggestions for increasing revenue and decreasing expenditure. These two figures can certainly be made closer, and the fiscal balance we hope for may even be achieved. Even if it is not achieved, the minor difference on paper cannot be considered a big problem. However, what we feel in our experience is whether this budget can be adhered to without change? In the past, every year's budget was often used up in less than half a year, and the result was that there was no choice but to resort to supplementary allocations. The biggest reason for this is probably due to temporary expenditures and rising prices. The budget for the thirty-sixth year is based on the expenditure situation of the thirty-fifth year, but now only a little over a month has passed in the thirty-sixth year, and the price situation is no longer what it used to be. Therefore, we suspect that this budget, which is quite close to balance, will only be a balance on paper if no other efforts are made, and will not benefit the actual fiscal problems.</p>
<p>(2) The Impact of Usury and Speculators</p>
<p>The most important of the so-called other efforts is still the effective control of prices. We analyze that the main reasons for rising prices, in addition to the increase in currency, are the actions of social idle funds. The increase in currency has led to rising prices, and even greater profits from buying and selling goods. This profit has encouraged idle funds to move in this direction, and merchants are willing to raise interest rates to absorb them. This has created high-interest loans. Nowadays, almost no merchant is not related to high-interest loans. After the trend of high-interest loans is formed, the rise in prices gains a powerful factor that fuels the flames. Clearly, in order to maintain the value of the currency and stabilize fiscal revenue and expenditure, the government uses various methods to flatten prices, so that it cannot rise. This is in line with the needs of the general public (except speculators). The weakness of the purchasing power of the general public is also enough to prevent prices from rising. However, if prices do not rise, merchants burdened with high-interest loans will encounter irresistible misfortune and have to use various methods to promote price increases. We can remember that many times in the past, price increases were due to merchants spreading rumors that the currency system had changed or that the official exchange rate had increased. The fragile market and people's hearts really cannot withstand the spread of these rumors. Therefore, the materials related to these rumors will increase in price first. Once the price increase starts, it spreads like an epidemic, involving various prices in an instant, and thus becomes a general rise. The speculators are smiling, the lives of the general public are suffering, and the government's efforts to balance revenue and expenditure and contract issuance are completely unsuccessful. This is just one of the tricks of speculators.</p>
<p>In the past eight months, the government's fiscal policy has been quite effective. We don't need to say anything else, just take prices as an example. Before April, prices in the Shanghai-Nanjing area had a small fluctuation almost every twenty days, and a major fluctuation every month. However, in the three months from May to July, a considerable degree of calm was maintained. However, in this calm atmosphere, we heard another kind of cry, which was the so-called commercial collapse. Merchants' cries like this were also seen after November last year, arousing sympathy from public opinion. In the pens of news reporters, it is often described as the collapse of the entire social economy, thus arousing widespread attention. In fact, today speculators and money shops have inseparable relationship, so the bankruptcy of a speculative firm will inevitably involve banks, or even make salary earners who covet higher interest rates suffer losses. In cities like Nanjing, if twenty merchant firms of considerable scale go bankrupt, it may bring down one or two small banks, causing considerable waves in the financial world, and making a part of society feel uneasy. For this kind of consideration, the government has no choice but to make relief considerations. The foreign exchange adjustment in August last year contained this meaning to some extent. That is to say, the government's policy of stabilizing prices resulted in panic among speculative businesses. Because to resolve the crisis of speculative business, it is necessary to give the opportunity to adjust prices. However, the more prices are adjusted, the more government expenditures increase, and the further the difference between revenue and expenditure becomes, the more it has to resort to issuance to offset this difference. This destroys the entire fiscal policy by itself, and the economic future moves another step in a more dangerous direction.</p>
<p>(3) Those Who Disrupt Prices Are Public Enemies of the People</p>
<p>The government's past indulgence policy of adjusting certain prices for a certain period only encouraged the development of speculative business and further increased commercial panic. We only need to see that whenever there is a major adjustment or fluctuation in prices, interest rates will inevitably rise sharply. For example, before the end of last year, during the emergency state of the silver market when summarizing the lunar year, the interest rate in Nanjing was usually still below one jiao and five fen. However, during the period of large price fluctuations in the lunar new year, the interest rate suddenly rose to more than two jiao. This fact clearly shows that one price fluctuation solved the commercial crisis of the previous period, but also brewed the commercial crisis of the next period. Layers of cause and effect, without end. Moreover, because speculators have learned from the generous profits gained from past price adjustments, they conserve their energy, wait for an opportunity to move, create rumors and make trouble, and do everything they can to sell short and buy long, so that legitimate businesses are greatly disadvantaged and gradually shift to the path of opportunism. This trend is truly a fatal wound to the future of commerce.</p>
<p>Speaking fairly, speculators use the means of disrupting market prices to achieve the goal of illegal income. In wartime, the country hangs it as a taboo and punishes it with sanctions. Even now, disrupting finance is still not allowed by law. Moreover, this behavior is not only harmful to the country, but also harmful to the majority of compatriots. From the perspective of social morality, it is absolutely not allowed. According to general principles, those who want to obtain extraordinary profits are willing to take extraordinary risks, and even suffer the sacrifice of collapse, which is originally expected. Each person who seeks practical benefits is responsible for himself. Speculators infringe on the interests of the public, attempt to satisfy their own desires, and therefore encounter crises, or even lose their fortunes and ruin their reputations. This is self-inflicted blame and is the result they deserve. There is no need to sympathize with them, let alone provide relief to them. We must recognize that most of the businesses that encounter crises because of stable prices are speculators, the scum of the commercial world, the powerful factors that fluctuate prices, and should be sanctioned. Their appeals obtaining results is the failure of the country's fiscal policy, and the beginning of a more difficult life for the national economy, especially the salary earners.</p>
<p>In a word, high prices will cause disaster to both the country and the people's livelihood, and only those treacherous merchants who specialize in speculation and opportunism will be smiling. We must recognize this point clearly.</p>
<p>(4) Stabilize Prices and Fight Against Speculators</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can know that "balancing the budget and stabilizing prices" are still the golden rules in the current fiscal policy. It is only necessary to implement them thoroughly without the slightest hesitation. Only the stability of prices can prevent the budget from being destroyed. Only the stability of prices can make the treacherous merchants who specialize in speculation and opportunism eat their own bitter fruit. Only the thorough stability of prices can reduce interest rates, so that legitimate merchants are not exploited by high-interest loans, and legitimate business can be guaranteed to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>However, we should pay attention to another point. High-interest loans do absorb a considerable amount of idle funds in society. The failure of speculators and the result of lower interest rates will inevitably make general idle funds feel at a loss. The government should seize this opportunity and sell factories that can make money. This batch of idle funds can definitely be guided to industrial investment, and the government can also use this to take back legal currency to fill the expenses of the national treasury.</p>
<p>The huge expenditure of more than eight years of the Anti-Japanese War has plunged the country's finances into a dead end and put the people's livelihood on an unsustainable road. There are naturally unavoidable reasons for this, but undeniably, there are also many aspects that should be studied in the measures taken. Now it is almost a terminal illness. We hope that this price fluctuation is the last time. We know very well that if the government's budget for this year is handled in the past, expenditures will inevitably exceed revenue by a lot, and it will have to rely on issuance. However, this old method can no longer be used. It is necessary to increase definite income—such as selling enemy and puppet property or factories that are currently state-owned as soon as possible, or even borrowing from abroad—to ensure that issuance does not increase any more. On the one hand, we must also be determined to fight against speculative merchants and reduce them, so that prices can be stabilized and high-interest loans cannot occur. After the recent price fluctuation, there must be a period of stable and well-off period. The government should use this period to select a few places where prices are prone to fluctuations and have a great impact—such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, etc., and then select ten or twenty kinds of daily necessities for people's livelihood and essential raw materials for industrial production, which were easily used by speculators to fluctuate prices in the past, and arrange them in advance. If there is a fluctuation, add control immediately. In this way, even if there is an increase, it can be calmed down, and speculative merchants will collapse one after another. If we are so careful and cautious for a year, then the political situation will gradually stabilize, the rural areas will gradually recover, export goods will gradually increase, and purchasing power will gradually increase. Then the fiscal economy can gradually enter a prosperous road.</p>
<p>In short, the coming year is an important juncture for China's finances. It is not an easy task to get through this juncture. It requires the double efforts and cooperation of the government and the people. The government must fulfill its due responsibilities, and the people must also fulfill their due obligations. In March last year, the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was held in Chongqing. Mr. Weng Wenhao attended the meeting as the Minister of Economic Affairs and reported. His conclusion was to ask everyone to act with conscience and fulfill their responsibilities. This conclusion is still valid now, especially for speculators who want to fluctuate prices and seek high profits. With your conscience, do not make trouble again, otherwise you will definitely eat your own bitter fruit.</p>
<h3>The Qiantang Project Takes the First Step: Quarrying in the Fuchun River</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 9th Quick News, Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>Recently, the "Pan En" and "Tog" sea vessels, which crossed the perilous Zimen Sandbar in Hangzhou Bay, proudly sailed into Jiangmen with the posture of the first conquerors of the Qiantang River beach, which really caused a sensation in the city of Hangzhou and the residents along the river. Chairman Shen Li and Mayor Zhou specially congratulated the crew members for this, and also hosted a banquet for this group of "historical figures" on the Qiantang River. Now, these two sea transports are constantly towing five wooden barges each, loading them with stones, and shuttling between Tangshan and Sibao.</p>
<p>Tangshan is a bustling area created by another group of "historical figures" on the Qiantang River. It is located in the middle of the two small villages of Lingqiao and Lishan in Fuyang County. It is a cluster of rich mountains overlooking the quiet Spring River, that is, the "Ten Ridges of Tangshan" which block the passage of the Xiaoshan Yiqiao to Tonglu Jiangnan Highway, a cluster of uncultivable stone mountains.</p>
<p>Well-known Sand and Stone Production Area</p>
<p>As early as before the Anti-Japanese War, the name of Tangshan was well known, because when the famous Qianjiang Bridge was built, engineers came here to collect a large amount of sand and gravel for the needs of the bridge project. Now, these neglected stone mountains are contributing their strength for the welfare of the people on both sides of the Qiantang River. Since the Anti-Japanese War, due to the neglect of the seawall, the river water has become a very serious disaster. In order to protect the lives and property of the people of Jiangnan, the government did not hesitate to invest heavily, and successively established the Qiantang River Seawall Emergency Repair Committee and the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, on the one hand, to urgently repair the collapsed seawalls and block the sea water from encroaching on the land; on the other hand, to plan the Qiantang River renovation project and build a water diversion dam to return the river water to a certain river channel, making it a beneficial river flow for smooth navigation. The emergency repair project is divided into two parts: first, using Chai seawall to urgently block; and then restoring the valuable legacy left by Emperor Qianlong - the stone seawall. After a year of efforts, under the conditions of difficulty in both materials and funding, the construction of the Chai seawall has been largely completed, and future projects are entrusted to stones. In the past few months, many projects have not been able to start due to the difficulty in procuring stones, and finally stagnated. According to the estimates of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, the crushed stone and block stone required for the first phase of the project by the end of June this year has reached 100,000 cubic meters. If such a large amount of stone is contracted by merchants, not only will the cost be huge, but also the supply and demand will be difficult to meet. In order to save expenses and cooperate with the construction, the Seawall Engineering Bureau decided to use the latest mountain-opening machinery and materials provided by the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" to quarry stone in Tangshan by itself. Thus, this forgotten name was revived in memory and became even more distinct.</p>
<p>New Machines Quarry Stone, Extremely Precious</p>
<p>Using air compressors to quarry stone in China was only applied in the post-victory restoration and construction state. According to the captain of the quarrying project team, engineer Wu Zhengang, there are only two units in Tangshan south of the Yangtze River. North of the Yangtze River, there were also two units in Tailai that were used in the Yellow River project, but due to the impact of the civil war, the two units have been destroyed by the communists. Now, in China, the only two air compressors used in construction projects are in Tangshan. After eight years of destruction during the Anti-Japanese War, at a time when construction is urgently needed everywhere, hearing this unfortunate news is indeed very frustrating. But this makes us feel particularly precious about the two air compressors in Tangshan. The air compressor, in appearance, is a simple machine of fifteen cubic feet, and there are no complicated parts. It is composed of two parts: a gasoline engine and a compressor. Each unit can be equipped with three air drills (Jackhamner). The air pressure for drilling stone is 80 pounds per square minute to 100 pounds per square minute. The pressure will automatically adjust when the pressure is insufficient, so there is no need for manual management. The essential parts of the air drill are only three kinds: drill rod, drill tip, handle and its upper part. Each air drill can drill two feet of stone holes in a quarter of an hour, and can drill 50 feet to 60 feet of holes per day. If manual stone drilling is used, three stone workers can only drill two feet deep in one day, the difference is very large, and the greatness of the mechanical effect can be seen from this! The air drill and the air compressor are connected by an air duct. The two ends of the air duct are made of rubber, and the middle is a one-inch iron pipe, which is the commonly used tap water pipe. Now the mountains along the river in Tangshan are covered with these long pipes and ropes for climbing. The current drilling depth is six feet, and the distance between the holes varies from five feet to nine feet. The distance between the holes and the edge of the rock is about four feet to eight feet, which must be determined according to the firmness or looseness of the stone. Each six-foot-deep hole is filled with a maximum of four dynamite (about 1.4 pounds) to blast away the stones that need to be blasted (three is not enough). The dynamite they use is Gelatin (40Strength) produced by Du-pont, with fifty pounds per box, divided into 135 packages, which are long cylindrical bodies, wrapped in waterproof paper, and will explode even in water. The detonator is inserted into the dynamite for explosion. The circuit connection uses the series method. The length of the electric wire between the holes reaches 30 feet. The machine twisted down one, just like pumping air with an air pump. Fifty holes of dynamite exploded at the same time. If the circuit is shortened, several more holes can be blasted.</p>
<p>Loading Explosives to Blast Stone, Experimenting in the Snow</p>
<p>According to their experiments, a maximum of 58 holes can be blasted at one time, but each time there is one hole that explodes but does not detonate. On the day the reporter visited Tangshan, he happened to encounter spring snow. In order to allow the reporter to observe the explosion situation on the spot, engineer Wu Zhengang kindly directed the loading of explosives to blast stones in the snow, and did a small-scale experiment. A total of six holes were blasted that time. The sound of the explosion was heavy and not loud, but the blasting force was very fierce, and the blasted stones flew very far. The reporter stood more than 100 meters away and watched from a distance, and there were still many stones flying from the top of his head, scaring the reporter to quickly put away the camera and run to the shade of the tree. On the wooden barge near the shore, three one-inch-thick ocean pine planks were also broken by the gravel, and the fierceness of the force can be seen in general. The six-foot-deep stone holes that are currently drilled can blast out eight to ten cubic feet of stone blocks per explosion, that is, "firing a cannon" once, blasting 50 holes at a time, each time can produce 400 to 500 cubic feet of stone. This is a very big number! After blasting once, it takes almost three days for manual cleaning! The biggest difficulty now is that manpower and machinery cannot cooperate. Engineer Wu said well: "It is just like our Chinese society, where the new and the old coexist, and if the cooperation is not good, the progress will be slow. And our biggest difficulty is that manpower cannot keep up with the machine - this is very clearly manifested in cleaning and transportation.</p>
<h3>Half a Dynamite, Blasting Large Stones</h3>
<p>The important work after the explosion is cleaning. One is to remove the mud and the other is to break the large stones. There is currently a formal water pump, which is a gasoline engine, with a motor and a battery, which is easier to start. The pumping volume is 350 gallons per minute (125 pounds per hour) The water pumping can wash away the mud on the Dnvamic head under the mountain as power. The stone materials needed for the seawall project at present are used to build water diversion and stone plate heads, and it is advisable to use block stone. However, it is very difficult to transport the blasted large stones, and it is not easy to break them manually, so Mcd-Gy Mstord is used to blast them. The method is to select a depression on the stone, and pay attention to the damaged surface, put half a dynamite, put the detonator into the dynamite, and pile about six inches of mud on it. The blasting force of the dynamite is downward, and the large stone can be blasted. If there is no position to put the dynamite, drill a five-inch or six-inch deep hole, and then apply the medicine to bomb, you can get the ideal block stone. As for the gravel needed for ordinary seawall construction, there are two cranes or stone crushers and a pre-shaped stone crusher jawgosher, all of which are gasoline engines. The latter can crush seven cubic yards of stone per hour, while manual labor requires about 30 people to cope. The former has not yet been used, but the stone blocks can be directly thrown onto the ship after crushing, which can reduce a lot of manpower. Before the machine is assembled, moving stones is the most difficult work. Ordinary commercial wooden sailing ships can load 15 cubic feet of stone at a time, and it takes six people a day to transport it. It can be seen that the speed of blasting stone and moving stone is very different, just like the plane and walking on the other side of the shore.</p>

<h3>Auspicious Omen, Green Calyx and Prosperous Flowers</h3>
<p>— Wuyuan, one day's news, our special correspondent Ning Po</p>
<p>Changtan Village (North Township), 40 miles away from the county seat, is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with clear and beautiful scenery. There are three kinds of precious plants in its territory. One is the Phoebe nanmu of Longxi Pavilion, the second is the sweet-scented osmanthus in front of the Tu Temple, and the third is the green plum beside the seed well. Rare things are precious, which is indeed rare in other places. The reporter passed through the area yesterday, and the light makeup of plum buds and flowers was reflected into the eyes from afar. Looking at it up close, the tree shape expanded, the body was strong and straight, the young branches were green and lush, the old trunks were scattered, and the flower buds and flowers were extremely prosperous. The green petals and green heart were clear and lovely in color. Asking the villagers, they said: This plum belongs to one of the green calyx, the age is still young, and there are absolutely no similar ones in the surrounding area. There are five petals, which bloom first and wither later. The fruit is always green and crisp and not yellow, containing auspicious qualities. Last year, the flowers were in full bloom and the autumn harvest was stable. This year, the flowers are even more abundant, and there is a great harvest. This can be verified. According to the plum blossoms, although there are many kinds, the only colors that are commonly seen are red, white, bright yellow, and green are rarely seen. It can be seen that the rare and wonderful flowers in the grass and trees are not easy to collect in their entirety, and it is recorded for the study of botanists.</p>

<h3>A Tragic Incident in Hong Kong's Transportation Sector: The Xian Steamer Burns, Hundreds of Passengers Perish Simultaneously, Either by Fire or Drowning</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Maritime Correspondent, Zǐ Jiàn, Dated the 4th</p>
<p>"The Xian Steamer is destroyed!" As this news spread, residents of Hong Kong flocked to the waterfront to "mourn" this unfortunate vessel. It was an "old friend" to the people of Hong Kong, having plied the waters between Hong Kong and Guangzhou for over two decades. Almost every resident of Hong Kong, with very few exceptions, had been a passenger on it. To draw a rough comparison, the relationship between the Xian Steamer and the people of Hong Kong was akin to that of a large steamer operating between Shanghai and Ningbo with the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Beyond the loss of the ship and cargo, valued at over five million Hong Kong dollars, the Xian Steamer fire directly and indirectly claimed the lives of at least two or three hundred people. This loss is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Fire Erupts from Smoke, Instantly Engulfing the Deck</p>
<p>The Xian Steamer caught fire just one hour before its scheduled departure for Guangzhou. Most of the passengers had already disembarked, some having taken a nap on board. The Xian Steamer was scheduled to depart at 6:00 AM that day. The fire broke out around 5:00 AM, when it was still dark. For some unknown reason, a thick plume of smoke suddenly billowed from the large cabin at the stern. Fire erupted from the smoke, and in an instant, it engulfed the entire deck and spread upwards. The passengers in the upper-level dining area were alerted in time to escape. However, those in the cabins below were trapped with no way out, as the doors were blocked by the flames. Some jumped into the water to escape. Fortunately, the waning moon was setting, and the current was not too strong. However, the distance from the cabin doors at the stern to the shore was over a hundred feet. Few were able to swim to the other side or be rescued. Thus, those who did not burn to death drowned, creating a scene of utter human tragedy!</p>
<p>According to the ship's supervisor, Yóu Kūn, who spoke to our reporter, the fire started near the "Yan Tai" area in the main cabin. When the fire broke out, the crew and passengers on the scene did their best to extinguish it, using over twenty cotton blankets. However, the fire was too intense, and flames burst from all sides of the blankets. In less than ten minutes, the entire ship was ablaze.</p>
<p>Cause of Fire Still Under Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The cause of the fire has not yet been definitively determined. Initial reports suggested that the ship was carrying gasoline, and a passenger carelessly left a spark, leading to the disaster. However, company officials have denied this, stating that the ship never carried any dangerous goods. Another report suggests that the main cabin contained a large quantity of goods such as rubber, rattan, and cardboard. It is suspected that the fire was caused by these flammable materials.</p>
<p>After the stern caught fire, the flames quickly spread to the left side of the ship, which was close to the pier, thus threatening the pier as well. About fifteen minutes after the fire started, the fire department received a report, and all the fire trucks were dispatched. Upon arrival, they first focused on extinguishing the flames on the pier, putting out the fire there. However, the fire on the ship did not diminish despite the concentrated efforts of the firefighters. The flames gradually spread to the right side of the ship and then from the main cabin to the third floor of the stern building. Every part of the ship was affected, with the most intense fire in the stern. The bow cabins were only partially affected, and some parts may be salvageable. After the fire broke out, Chinese and Western detectives also arrived to maintain order, sealing off traffic near the pier and prohibiting pedestrians from passing through to facilitate rescue efforts and prevent potential explosions.</p>
<p>The ship carried a total of 350 tons of cargo, including over 1,200 pieces of opium, 150 bales of raw cotton (over twenty of which were salvaged), approximately 2,000 pieces of hardware, wire ropes, iron nails, scrap copper, scrap iron, and zinc sheets, over 1,000 pieces of Western medicine and pigments, totaling 4,810 pieces. The loss is enormous, at least over a million dollars.</p>
<p>At Least Two to Three Hundred Passengers Perished</p>
<p>As for the exact number of passengers who perished, it is difficult to determine the exact figure at this time, but it is believed to be at least two to three hundred. It is reported that over thirty charred bodies have been found in the main cabin. When firefighters sprayed water, they disintegrated, and intestines and other organs were seen flowing out, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<p>According to company sources, nearly a thousand passengers had purchased tickets in advance from the company. Mr. Chē Zàiqīng, the Deputy Manager of the Dàgōng Bookstore in Hong Kong, and his wife, both from Shanghai, were traveling to Guangzhou this morning with their children. When the fire broke out, Mr. Chē carried his son, and his wife carried their daughter, jumping into the sea to escape. Afterward, their daughter went missing.</p>
<p>Rescuing People from the Sea, Ancient Paintings Destroyed by Flames</p>
<p>Zhāng Ān, a partner at the Yuè Nán Hotel on Connaught Road, acted heroically, jumping into the sea and rescuing seven passengers.</p>
<p>Among the passengers in the dining room were a group of Guangdong antique collectors. They had brought precious ancient artifacts to Hong Kong a week earlier to participate in an exhibition. While their lives were fortunately spared, most of their antiques were lost in the fire. It is said that the lost masterpieces included the "Xiānguǎn Jiù Jīn Tú" by Huáng Dàchī, an album of paintings by Wú Lì, a fan album by Dīng Zhènpéng, an album by Huáng Shígǔ, a fan painting by Emperor Huīzōng of Song, miscellaneous albums from the Song and Yuan dynasties, "Dámó Facing the Wall" by Guànxiū of the Five Dynasties, and "Mother and Child Apes" by a Song artist, all national treasures.</p>
<p>Docking for Repairs, Resuming Service in Two to Three Months</p>
<p>Our reporter had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Willie, the owner of the Xian Steamer. According to him, the ship's hull was burned, but the engine was fortunately preserved. After docking for repairs, it should be able to resume service in two to three months.</p>
<p>The Xian Steamer has a cargo capacity of 660 tons. It was built in 1924 at the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong and is owned by the Tung An Steamship Company. It is insured for 800,000 dollars. After burning for six hours, it is still afloat, and the surface does not appear to be severely damaged. Part of the ship's chimney has not been damaged. The gangway at the bow also suffered only minor damage. When the Pacific War broke out, the ship sailed to Macau (its sister ship, the Shu An, sank in the waters of Hong Kong). In 1944, it was seized by the Japanese and returned to Hong Kong. After the war, it was recovered and resumed service on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route for a year.</p>

<h3>Tang Dike Project: Taking the First Step, Quarrying Stone on the Banks of the Fuchun River (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Quick Dispatch from Hangzhou, Dated the 9th. Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Hangzhou, Huáng Xíngtiān</p>
<p>(Continued from Page Seven)</p>
<p>At the Tangshan Quarry, there are also two very important machines – bulldozers, a D7 and a D4, powered by a combination of gasoline and diesel engines. They are used for leveling earth and towing heavy objects. The movement of all the machinery at Tangshan depends on their power. Recently, Engineer Wu and Lu Lianghui, the head of the Mechanical Group, have been trying to drag the D7 bulldozer up the mountain. Because the water pressure from the on-site pump is very low, it is not enough to wash away the topsoil on the mountain. Therefore, they want to use the bulldozer to remove the topsoil, reducing the burden of the flushing work, saving labor, and speeding up the work. According to Mr. Wu Zhengang, "The sea dike requires a lot of stone. If the fundamental project begins and the six-year plan is realized, with the construction of breakwaters and stone headlands on Hangzhou Bay, even more extensive development will be needed. Therefore, we must actively reduce manual labor and achieve complete mechanization of stone quarrying, moving, and transporting!" I believe his words will soon come true. Currently, they are building two docks and already have two seagoing vessels, the "Pan En" (650 tons) and the "Tug" (450 tons), and twenty wooden barges, each capable of carrying 50 cubic meters of stone. Each vessel will tow five wooden barges, carrying 500 cubic meters per day. However, the stone loading cannot keep up, so they are currently only able to transport 200 to 300 cubic meters per day. Assuming twenty sunny days per month, they can produce 60,000 cubic meters per year. Although this figure is 40,000 cubic meters short of the original plan, as long as the transportation work can be closely coordinated with the blasting work mechanically, not only can it be made up, but it can also exceed the target. Since the start of work more than two months ago, 1,000 cubic meters of stone have been produced. Workers are paid in flour, with one bag for every three days of work, averaging fourteen pounds per day. If contracted out, each cubic meter would cost 7,000 yuan. Currently, according to cost accounting, each cubic meter only costs 5,000 yuan. In other words, the annual target can save 10.2 million yuan. Moreover, contract work will increase due to the price index, while self-extraction can reduce costs as production increases!</p>
<p>Currently, there are an average of forty engineers, managers, mechanics, and workers working at Tangshan every day. Among them, in addition to the engineering team, there are sixteen long-term workers who are working and receiving mechanical training at the same time. They live in two mobile homes, with running water and electricity. A D.C. Generator 1.5KW DC generator allows 60-watt light bulbs to shine brightly. This is something to be proud of in Tangshan because, along the Qiantang River upstream from Hangzhou, only Tangshan has electric lights! The indoor equipment is simple, and they sleep on military canvas beds, but the reporter spent a night there and lived very comfortably, feeling as warm as early summer. That night, it snowed heavily, but none of us felt it. All the staff are young, not only enthusiastic and lively but also get along like family. At first, they lived a damp tent life, but soon they created this "exclusive village" centered on mobile homes, surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the river. The once-dead valley has now become a vibrant place. Nearby villagers are watching their new neighbors' prosperity with curious eyes. Only one thing makes them uneasy: the mountain's Temple of the God of Wealth has been used as a gunpowder depot by the engineering team. During the Lunar New Year, many people want to burn incense and worship Buddha but have no way to do so. A "gentry" from Lishan Township complained to the reporter: "The Bodhisattva is a big deal for us. They put the gunpowder in the temple, this, this..." In fact, the villagers are going to worship the Bodhisattva for their own destiny, while the engineering team is using their hands to create a good destiny for the farmers working along the river! The Qiantang River has been plagued by disasters for generations. They want to use human power to subdue the reckless nature of the Qiantang River, just like our ancestors tamed cattle and horses by hand, making them serve humanity. They not only want to prevent the water from harming the residents along the river again but also want to make it serve humanity, creating vast fertile fields and facilitating boat transportation. The stone quarrying engineering team is shouldering the most basic mission of this great plan. They want to put the destiny of the farmers, which is entrusted to the illusory Bodhisattva, in the real world, in their own hands. They are pioneers. Although they surrounded the Bodhisattva with gunpowder, they are right, they should be respected and loved. The reporter left the "exclusive village" of Tangshan, and will always cherish and look forward to this vibrant group!

<h3>Hold Back on Praising This Living Hell</h3>
<p>Why do many people outside the Communist areas think the Communist Party is good?</p>
<p>But why do people inside the Communist areas try every trick possible and risk countless hardships to escape? They endure leaving their hometowns, abandoning their elderly parents, and abandoning their beloved wives and children. Don't they know that escaping means they will have no food or clothing? Don't they know the taste of sleeping on the streets, freezing in the cold without clothes and suffering from hunger? But they escape at all costs! Heavens! Why do they escape at all costs?</p>
<p>It is not surprising that many people outside the Communist areas think the Communist Party is good because they are far from that society and have not seen through the "mystery of that society."</p>
<p>When you do not know a person or have not been to a place, and you first hear the person's great name or the prosperity of a certain place, then everything you idealize in your mind is not the truth about that person or place unless you truly interact with that person or visit that place. Your understanding will then be real.</p>
<p>Regarding the mystery of the Communist Party, to clarify the truth for everyone, it is best to give them the opportunity to taste that insidious, vicious, and bloody taste. But if you can't escape, don't blame me! (Ā Bīng)</p>
<h3>Private Schools Still Exist in Changshu District</h3>
<p>A few days ago, I was passing by Damuqiao Road when I suddenly heard the sound of chanting and reading. I am naturally curious, so I followed the sound and found forty or fifty young children sitting in a dark thatched house, being taught by a teacher using methods from a century ago. The textbooks were not nationally prescribed, the lighting in the room was not suitable for children's eyesight, and a dialect was used, making the words unclear. I think there are public and private schools all over Changshu District, enough to meet the needs of school-age children. Why are there still private schools being established? I hope the Education Bureau will send someone to inspect the situation and ban them to emphasize education and revive morals. (Féng Yì)</p>

<h3>Dora - One of "Russian Profiles"</h3>
<p>— By Gorky, Translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>In the sanatorium, there were eight people suffering from lung disease. Among all patients, those with lung disease are usually the most willful: because as long as their humidity rises a little, they will be fearful, angry, or dejected for no reason.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis bacillus has a conflicting power: it kills a person's life on one hand, and arouses his desire for life on the other. This can be seen from the following fact: tuberculosis usually has a high degree of erotic characteristics, and even the most hopeless patients have a stubborn and noble belief in recovering their health. I seem to remember that the pathologist Strumpell called this condition "tuberculosis hope."</p>
<p>Eight tuberculosis patients lived together in a sanatorium in Crimea, all cared for by a maid named Dora, whose background was unknown. Sometimes she said she was Estonian, sometimes she said she was Karelian. However, she spoke like a Tauridean. She sometimes spoke with a Tatar accent and sometimes with an Armenian accent. She was tall and strong, but her steps were light, and her movements were quick and agile. Her face had a good quality like that of a horse trainer; her red lips contained a kind and fatty smile, and her big eyes emitted a strange light purple color, containing the oiliness of that smile. When she was contemplative, her less radiant eyes were clouded, and her gaze became dull. She didn't have much knowledge and appeared foolish, especially when she tried to be cunning, she appeared particularly stupid. Therefore, the patients called her "Dura" (meaning melon in Russian), not very cleverly teasing her name. But the girl didn't get angry because of this, and continued to smile. She treated the patients with as much tolerance as a mother treats her children. Whenever a lung-sick man reached out his cold, lead-colored hand to grab her, she would calmly push away the poor, moist hand of the unfortunate person with her big, red palm, and say, "Don't grab! It's not good for you."</p>
<p>All kinds of people stubbornly pursued her: shop assistants, porters, and once a seemingly powerful fisherman—a widower. They liked her rough beauty, her physical strength, her tireless energy, and her optimistic nature. Everyone competed to take this peaceful and docile animal as his life partner; but her attitude towards men was like that of a free and wealthy man, she knew very well when and where to use her capital. She refused those marriage proposals with that monotonous, expressionless, and inoffensive smile, she listened quietly to the endless thoughts of the patients, and pushed away their reckless caresses.</p>
<p>Whether the north wind was blowing, or thick fog was bringing a layer of frost to the houses on the top of the hill, whether the patients were shriveling up in thick quilts, or complaining about the cold even when wearing warm clothes, she was uncomfortably hot. At night, after arranging for everyone to sleep, Dora would put on a black scarf embroidered with red roses in the corner, walk to the balcony, kneel under my window, look at the sky, and sigh as she prayed:</p>
<p>"Ah, Holy Mother... Christ, Lord! You, Saint Nicholas, the humble servant of God!..."</p>
<p>I couldn't see any poetry in Dora, she didn't like flowers, thinking that flowers would only mess up the room. One night, a pastor's wife, was suffering from intestinal tuberculosis, and was ecstatic because of the brilliance of the sky and the stars, Dora rudely drove away her enthusiasm. "The sky," she said, "is like a vegetable meatball..."</p>
<p>One day, the ninth patient arrived. He panted laboriously, climbed the stairs to the attic, grabbed the top railing and said to Dora, "You see how handsome I am, don't you?"</p>
<p>There was a mixture of sorrow and joy in these words. He smiled, glancing at the great big girl, her round and full breasts.</p>
<p>"Ha! What a healthy animal you are!" he said, hurriedly swallowing a mouthful of cold air. "Oh, you can help me recover, can't you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, of course," Dora replied in her Armenian accent.</p>
<p>The man had the face of a night owl, round cat eyes, a nose with a curled tip, a few black whiskers, in short, a sneering and cruel face.</p>
<p>From that day on, Dora seemed to have been enchanted and changed, giving us great discomfort. She began to ignore our wishes, hurriedly walked through our rooms, cleaned weakly, and only answered our complaints and accusations angrily, but at the same time, a glimmer of intoxication flashed in her horse-training eyes. She seemed to suddenly become deaf and mute, often turning her head attentively towards the attic, where the night owl-like student Filipov lay coughing and unable to catch his breath. Whenever she was free during the day, Dora would run to him and stay in his room until sunset, with no way to lure her out.</p>
<p>Speaking of that man—he was dying. The scene of death was different from usual, he laughed and mocked, whistling a comic tune from beginning to end, but the tune was often interrupted by bursts of coughing. He was a bit deliberately pretentious; he looked like a fearless demon, but that mask was finally cleverly exposed.</p>
<p>"What do you think of these strange things, my dear friend?" he often said to me, narrowing his cat eyes. "Do you like these? Day, night, birth, love, knowledge, death, isn't it? Isn't it funny? As the French say, N'est-ce pas? Especially funny for a twenty-six-year-old—I'm talking about myself... Dora!"</p>
<p>At this time, I heard the sound of spoons and the rustling of furniture, Dora appeared, her eyes wide open, silently waiting for the man's instructions.</p>
<p>"My good old woman, bring me some grapes, quickly!" he would order her, then turn to me and say, "A very ignorant and stupid woman."</p>
<p>He hated all the patients, and would mercilessly ridicule them as soon as they showed a little bit of strangeness, and people didn't like him either. As for me, he became friends with me because he liked literature, which made us very close.</p>
<p>"Literature is the best of all human inventions," he would say, touching his lips with his lead-colored hand. "The closer to life, the better..."</p>
<p>In my opinion, he was dying not so much because of lung disease, but because his soul had suffered a serious blow.</p>
<p>He died on the sixty-ninth day after entering the sanatorium, and in the throes of death he muttered blankly, "Fima... my whole life... I love you... only you... forever, Fima... darling..."</p>
<p>At that time, I was sitting at the foot of his bed, and Dora was standing beside Filipov, sniffing and patting her dry hair with her big palm.</p>
<p>She took a package and clipped it under her armpit.</p>
<p>"What is he saying?" she asked anxiously, straightening her body. "Who is this 'Fima' he's talking about?"</p>
<p>"Obviously a girl, a woman, he loved before, and still loves now."</p>
<p>"He? This—Fima?" Dora asked in surprise. "No—no, he loves me. He loved me as soon as he came here..."</p>
<p>But she listened quietly to the student's delirium, raised her gray eyebrows, wiped her moist face with her apron, threw the package onto my lap, and said, "This is his burial clothes; socks, shirt, slippers." Then she quietly left the room.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the student Filipov stopped delirious. He looked eagerly at the black square window on the white wall and sighed. Obviously he wanted to say something, but couldn't. Then, his small body, exhausted to the bone, straightened out in eternal peace.</p>
<p>I went to find Dora. She was standing on the balcony, looking down at the place where the sky and the sea met, so dark, but different on both sides. She turned her fat face to look at me, and I was surprised to find that her face was unusually stern.</p>
<p>"He's dead. Go bury him, Dora."</p>
<p>"I don't want to."</p>
<p>Dora began to rub the floor with her feet, as if to wipe away saliva.</p>
<p>"I don't want to," she repeated. "I don't want to do anything for such a person! Think about it, what is he! He said he loved me, but he has always been..."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you see he is already dead, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"Oh, what does it matter? Of course I know he's dead. I'm not blind, am I? I even used my last penny to buy him burial clothes. As soon as he arrived here, I knew he was going to die, but I said to myself: poor child!... He will definitely die! But everyone has to die. But why did he have to lie? 'I have never loved a girl,' he said. Well, now you're lying here, and there's a girl for you... Death can go to hell, but you can't lie..."</p>
<p>She was speaking in a low voice, as if thinking about something else. Then, suddenly, she began to sob—so sorrowfully, as if she had swallowed a full cup of boiling water and burned herself.</p>
<p>"Come on, Dora!..."</p>
<p>"If you are so kind to such a person, dress him yourself! As for me—no, no, I don't want to. What did he do to me?—Just a game!"</p>
<p>"I don't know how to dress the dead..."</p>
<p>"What do I care about that? I don't know him, do you think I know him?"</p>
<p>"But he is dead after all!"</p>
<p>"Oh, so what? Don't persuade me. I don't want to see such a person... You shouldn't lie..."</p>
<p>In the end, she refused to dress him and stayed alone on the balcony.</p>
<p>When I was dressing the student Filipov for burial, I suddenly heard a low, heartbreaking sob. I ran out and went to the balcony.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it will make humans cry particularly, fiercely, and piercingly: Dora cried out with such tears. Kneeling on the floor. Hitting her head against the railing, sobbing, crying, making harsh hissing sounds, uttering such words:</p>
<p>"My tyrannical loved one, my little monster, my dearest, my unforgettable child..."</p>

<h3>Casual Talks on Couplets</h3>
<p>— By Zhan Weng</p>
<p>After Nanjing was recovered, the party members held a memorial service for Zheng Rong. Zhang Taiyan wrote a couplet saying: "You gentlemen are petty thieves and dogs, the dead cannot rest in peace. This place is a dragon crouching and a tiger crouching, ancient people's empty words." It can be said that laughter, scolding, and anger all become articles.</p>
<p>Tang Caichang mourned Tan Zhuangfei: "How long has it been since I parted with you, suddenly startled by the flying electricity; how can I bear to bring a twenty-year-old beheading friend, to go to the spring terrace together; idly gain a lone minister to go to the frontier, the flute is extremely mournful." "Near the supreme being for just over ten days, killed by a group of villains, willingly abandon four hundred million to be slaves and concubines, buried forever in hell; only leaving the three heroes of Fusang, sword energy touching the sky." Liang Rengong said that every word is vivid and pierces the heart. Also, Tan had a sentence before his death: "Looking at the door, I only think of Zhang Jian, enduring death for a moment to wait for Du Gen." Tang also had a sentence before his death: "Better to offer a head to die for a friend, no true face to see the demons." But I only feel desolate.</p>
<h3>Poems from Dream Outside the Building</h3>
<p>— By Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Watching Flowers</p>
<p>Changing feathers and moving palaces, the meaning is not true, rolling up the curtain gracefully is not for oneself; how many tears of beauty are known, who remembers the eighth month of spring at the banquet.</p>
<p>Answering a Guest</p>
<p>The drifting sorrowful guest arrives at the riverside village, the profound meaning first peeps into the gate of all mysteries; having long realized the solemnity of emptiness and form, why must I carve out an image of a statue; I am glad that the spiritual heart is still there, the poems still preserve the elegant way; I have been careful in concealing my name in order to achieve understanding, I am willing to discuss my whereabouts with you.</p>
<p>The ancient constant flow is also new, what is the reason for chastity without peeling and restoring; closing the door to wind and moon is all idle business, who is the master of the passing landscape; the distant ravines rise and fall, becoming eternal sighs, the wandering souls return to the island and are also close; with you, I intend to recognize this body in the subtle light of God.</p>
<h3>Two Prose Pieces</h3>
<p>— By Zhi Mo</p>
<p>Newsboy</p>
<p>The newsboy, this green-clothed man of news, runs busily all day long.</p>
<p>He desperately spreads the seeds of truth for life, and delivers the gospel that the people pray for; from early morning to evening, he shouts loudly and hurries on his way; in the cold dawn, and in the dark and rainy night, he shouts in a long voice: "Selling newspapers!"</p>
<p>Every time I hear this weak shout, a kind of pitying thought immediately floods my heart. I think calmly: A newspaper, after the reporter's interview, the editor's arrangement, revision, and deletion, and the typesetter's typesetting and printing, I don't know how much hard work it has gone through before it is born into the hands of the newsboy to spread to the world...</p>
<p>However, in this economic turmoil and soaring prices, it is really submerged by war, and the gospel is replaced by tearing and killing. The entire page is filled with these ominous words, so people begin to hate and worry.</p>
<p>But the faithful newsboy still braves the cold and delivers this yesterday's history, today's spiritual food!</p>
<p>Raincoat and Love</p>
<p>I don't know who angered the rain god, forcing this cold winter rain to cry all day long...</p>
<p>People are very calm, never touching these sprinkled tears to proclaim the suffering of the earth to the world.</p>
<p>In this atomic age, raindrops dance on the glass; so, raincoats appear on the market, showing off to people—this messenger of love, delivering valuable gifts, begins to give them to the people he loves.</p>
<p>In the evening, in the dark courtyard, the conversation between men and women comes.</p>
<p>"Did you really accept someone else's raincoat?"</p>
<p>"How could I refuse!"</p>
<p>"Our love for these past few years..."</p>
<p>"Love! It can't protect against the rain!"</p>
<p>This winter rain tragedy ended and disappeared in the splashing sound.</p>
<p>So, the cold rain cried even more sadly...</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood 170</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"After the raid, they will definitely suffer; even become angry. This anger, of course, will not reach us. Like those rascals, they are bound to vent their anger on the common people. For no reason, they will grab the common people and call them 'unstable elements.' After our raid, they can use this as an excuse to commit adultery, plunder, arson, and murder! Isn't it these innocent common people who are unlucky?... My opinion..."</p>
<p>When Hejian said this, he suddenly paused, as if the storyteller had reached the important point and announced "to be continued tomorrow", selling suspense. Presumably, he was also a bit dry-mouthed and tongue-tied. Hejian grabbed a cigarette and distributed one to me and Mr. W, each; at the same time, he looked at Yaoqun and Xiaohucheng with some apology; indicating that he could not provide anything other than cigarettes to suppress their nerves.</p>
<p>"My opinion is also to imitate Zhuge Kongming's secret: 'Think about retreating before thinking about advancing;' that is to say, before launching a raid, we should build a protective wall for the common people. On the other hand, we also have to make a safe plan for our subordinates; because we basically only have these few people with clear heads, this little bit of essence must not be wasted, or sacrificed excessively..."</p>
<p>Mr. W smiled with his bright eyes, but he did not interrupt, because he wanted to listen to know whether Hejian's plan was the same as his own.</p>
<p>"I am willing to take a trip first to find out the truth about their current situation, and then formulate a seemingly 'deceiving the heavens' method to blind them; and then use an effective safety method to give them a surprise attack, only giving them a severe lesson, so that they dare not move rashly——</p>
<p>"Mr. Feng, didn't you say that our base is a bit unstable? I also have to inquire about this point to see to what extent this instability has reached. I suspect we may be a bit paranoid?... "This sentence seemed to have a slight sting for Mr. W, but Hejian's sincerity in tone and expression rounded out the edges and corners of the words.</p>
<p>"Maybe;" Mr. W also expressed hesitation, "but I think it's best to clean up this paranoid fog completely; the safety of intelligence work must not be vague in the slightest, it must be practical! The 'deceiving the heavens' method you just proposed is just in our plan, and it is also the main purpose of my special request for advice——this method, I am afraid, will completely rely on you, brother...." Mr. W's expression drew a question mark.</p>
<p>"Okay!" Hejian also smiled cleverly. This is exactly the expression of "great minds think alike." "But I have to take advantage of that old man who is obsessed with the past——he likes to pretend to imitate the ancients, in reality, it is equivalent to monkeys doing tricks... Brother, is this the same method?"</p>
<p>Mr. W nodded with a smile. Immediately after, they studied the technology about the radio wave distance. I understood very well what they were up to, and Yaoqun had a lot of research on radio waves, and immediately gave them a good supplement. Only Little Tiger in the room not only did not understand the subject of this conversation, but also did not understand why the raid that they were just talking about so enthusiastically suddenly shifted to radio waves; so he stared blankly, paying attention to everyone's expressions.</p>
<p>We studied the time, location, method, aftermath, retreat, and other steps of the raid again from beginning to end. In the process of research, Yaoqun's contribution not only shocked Mr. W, but also stunned Hejian. Although he had controlled Yaoqun's academic process and time, he probably did not expect Yaoqun's academic ability to be so strong and her progress to be so advanced. In addition to admiration, he also felt a little ashamed, ashamed of what? It is in line with a common saying, "dogs look down on people"! I think he used to regard Yaoqun as an ordinary "unusual" woman; at most, he would put her on the same level as Pingzi. After this conversation, I think he will look at Yaoqun with a moderately elevated gaze.</p>
<h3>A Torch—One of the Essays on Life</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Korolenko has a prose poem titled "A Torch." He said: "One dark autumn night, sailing in a dangerous river, no stars, no moon, the sky is dark, the earth is dark, everything is dark. Suddenly, I saw in front of the turning beach of the river, at the foot of the black mountain, a little torch was flashing. It flashes clearly and strongly, and is very close. I liked to say, "Ha, God bless, I'm about to get to my accommodation!" The rower turned his head and looked, and said lightly, "It's still far away!" I don't believe it, the torch is clearly in front, and it seems that it only takes two or three oars to reach it. However, the rower is experienced after all; our boat is still sailing in the river as black as ink for a long time. But that little torch is still in front, flashing and beckoning, always so close, and always so far away. Life is like sailing in such a dangerous river, the torch is still far away! But it is always in front, rowing up one oar at a time, and there will always be a time to arrive."</p>
<p>I first read this poem fifteen or sixteen years ago; the longer the years pass, I always remember: "Life is like sailing in such a dangerous river, that little torch, flashing in front, beckoning, always so close, and always so far away." Fifteen or sixteen years ago, I also happily welcomed that torch, thinking that "I was about to get to my accommodation"! Until today, I can only believe the rower's words: "It's still far away!" Our only belief is: Row up one oar at a time, and there will always be a time to arrive."</p>

<h3>At the Drama Festival Party</h3>
<p>— Wind</p>
<p>People from the film and drama circles have all arrived, everyone said: "We are all one family!"</p>
<p>At the gate of the Municipal Drama School, a small archway celebrating the Drama Festival was built, just like the scenery on the stage. This is the first achievement that the students of the Drama School have shown to people.</p>
<p>At the signing place at the entrance of the hall on the fourth floor, many students from the Drama School stepped forward to greet people. The name of Tian Han on the signing paper was particularly large, and everyone had to take a look at it.</p>
<p>The exhibition hall is also together. The flat part is the information collected by Xu Muyun, including many photos, zaju collections, and facial makeup diagrams. The first exhibit was the list of operas celebrating the Double Tenth Festival when Zhang Xueliang supervised Shandong. There were about Shang Xiaoyun, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, etc. participating in the performance, and Yang Xiaolou performed the finale, which greatly envied the opera fans.</p>
<p>In the part of the drama exhibition, there were many photos of the Moscow Art Theater, and many French theater photos, and the explanations were all in French. A guest who understood French was dragged to explain to others.</p>
<p>People from the drama and film circles have all arrived, and the students of the Drama School are busy asking their predecessors to sign their names. The names on their signature books are as complete as the names signed at the door.</p>
<p>The party began, Xiong Fuxi first gave a speech, and Gu Yiqiao. In the school, Xiong Fuxi is the chairman of the academic affairs committee, and Gu Yiqiao is the vice-chairman. Although the latter is the director of the Education Bureau, Old Xiong still takes the lead.</p>
<p>There were four kinds of snacks, including peanuts, sandwiches, beef, and yam chunks, all made by the students of the Drama School. It is said that there is an unlimited supply of wine, but the alcoholics are not interested in those cold yellow wines.</p>
<p>However, Xiong Fuxi was the most energetic. He repeatedly dragged others to toast, and also diligently entertained guests with peanuts, constantly saying in his mouth, "Peanuts are delicious, peanuts are really delicious?"</p>
<p>There was no scheduled performance program. Zhao Jingshen was coaxed onto the stage and sang a section of Kunqu opera. It was not enough, and he also performed the story of Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying in "The West Chamber."</p>
<p>Wu Zuguang's talent for telling jokes is the best, and he can't escape it.</p>
<p>Ding Cong didn't have much to perform on stage. He said, "Everyone just watch me snore."</p>
<p>A guest performed "Ballet" in the waltz music, the dance was beautiful, and the people sitting also stood up to watch.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of programs, Xiong Fuxi and Wu Tian, as the hosts, dragged people to join in as soon as they saw them, making people dare not approach them.</p>
<p>There were many singing programs, although not all of them were satisfactory, the applause and applause were always endless.</p>
<p>The traffic on North Sichuan Road was congested, and the guests arrived later. Every time a senior gentleman arrived, the students of the Drama School who held the signature book were very busy. People can get to know many people because of this. This is Li Jianwu, that is Yu Ling...</p>
<p>People also know because of this that Xia Yan and Ying Lingwei did not arrive.</p>
<p>The four large fire vats in the hall are the most popular. Each fire vat is surrounded by people and there is no ventilation. People who do not know each other can also talk very harmoniously. "The drama circle is one family!" Everyone's heart is as hot as charcoal.</p>
<h3>Old Couplets and New Words</h3>
<p>— Listening to Pine Trees</p>
<p>Zeng Wenzheng was most adept at creating couplets, and Zhang Wenxiang also often boasted of his own abilities. Many of the couplets created by Xiangxiang were widely praised, as the main point of couplets is their unwavering accuracy. It is inappropriate to use common phrases with the other party, and one's own identity and tone must also be perfectly matched to be truly wonderful. Apart from various long couplets, Nanpi was particularly skilled at using idioms, creating them naturally, unmatched in his time. When Li Hefei first became Chancellor, he was granted a birthday celebration that year. Wenxiang personally wrote a couplet to congratulate him, saying, "The court has appointed a Chancellor like Sima! Is the old man like a dragon?" The first line uses the "History of Song," referring to his initial appointment. The second line uses the "Tao Te Ching," referring to the surname Li. The superb and grand tone could not be matched by others, and the identity of the other party could only be worthy of it by Wenzhong. When Wenzhong reached his sixtieth birthday, talented and learned men in Wenxiang's staff proposed couplets, but none satisfied Nanpi. As the birthday celebration approached, Huang Zhonglian, a historian and Wenxiang's nephew-in-law, was also on staff. He casually mentioned that the current couplet might not surpass the previous one. Wenxi raised his beard and laughed, saying, "How can you underestimate me? I happened to think of a couplet yesterday evening, not only still using idioms, but also still being twelve characters." The whole room looked at each other in surprise, privately doubting its possibility. Nanpi immediately took up a brush on the prepared birthday congratulatory couplet paper and wrote, "Heaven gave birth to him for the sake of the country, people look up to him as if he were a celestial being." The first line comes from Tang Shou's eulogy to Li Beiping Fu Zhong, "Heaven gave birth to Li Sheng, for the sake of the country." The second line uses the story of Li Guo sharing the same boat. However, if this couplet were not for celebrating Wenzhong's birthday, and were applied to other Prime Ministers named Li, the identities would be entirely mismatched. The difficulty is not in the fact that both lines quote idioms, both referring to great men named Li, but in fitting Hefei's identity as a Prime Minister who calmed great chaos and achieved great success. However, it is fortunate that the surname Li has such historical figures; Zeng and Zuo might not have such suitable idioms. I heard this story from Mr. Huang Zhonglian while sitting with Shen Meisou. Meisou said: These two couplets stood out from the crowd, and were widely circulated, worthy of being called famous couplets. Not only could the master hand of Xiangxiang not surpass them, but even Ji Wenda's pure temple birthday couplets, although praising appropriately, could not overwhelm them in superb grandeur.</p>

<h3>Stealing Half a Day of Leisure - Introducing a Coffee Shop to You</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wen</p>
<p>Shanghai's coffee shops were originally mostly exclusively for foreigners, especially in the past on Avenue Joffre. When the lights came on, there were quite a few White Russian nobles and Russian beauties in some smoky little coffee shops, either singing loudly or chanting softly, with a rather romantic atmosphere. Since the fashion of drinking coffee became popular among our upper-class Chinese, coffee shops exclusively for Chinese people have also sprung up like mushrooms. During the period when Shanghai was occupied, the coffee shop business had a golden age, and there was even a coffee king (CPC) capitalist. However, those coffee shops exclusively for Chinese people were often decorated tackily and charged high prices. As a result, some people who loved to drink coffee and paid attention to the atmosphere of coffee shops instead went to some coffee shops run by foreigners to find quieter places. During the enemy-puppet period, British and American customers were all locked up in concentration camps, and those coffee shops seized the opportunity to do business with Chinese people. As a result, several of them still have a lot of Chinese customers to this day.</p>
<p>Among these small coffee shops, the one named "Little," located opposite the Grand China Theatre, is the most familiar to everyone. Because of its good location, the business is also very good. There is also one called "Little" on Route Amiral Bayle. A relatively unfamiliar one is the Little Cafe Shop opposite the Cathay Theatre.</p>
<p>This shop is located on Avenue Joffre, facing north from the south. The word "frontage" is actually very inappropriate, it really only has a small entrance, with a cigarette counter placed there. Straight ahead is an escalator upstairs. It is indeed not easy to find unless you are a regular customer.</p>
<p>Going up the escalator, there are two doors, which will make you wonder which one to choose. When you pay attention to the sign on the door, and push the door open, you don't see anyone. It turns out that you have to turn a corner to get there. This point of twists and turns is very interesting to people.</p>
<p>When you pass through these twists and turns, and suddenly feel enlightened, a coffee room with three shop fronts appears before your eyes. I can't say how beautiful the decoration is, but the colors are well-coordinated. I remember that in the past, the place seemed to be a little bigger, but now it has been reduced in size. But here you can avoid some familiar friends that you don't want to run into, allowing you to spend a quiet afternoon or a lonely night alone, because not many Chinese people go here.</p>
<p>If you like to play pranks, you can also ask a friend to meet you there. When the time comes, you can watch from the window as they look around bewildered.</p>
<p>The interior decoration, with train-style seats against the wall by the windows, is not crowded, and the seats are quite comfortable. When the aroma of coffee and the smoke of cigars fill the room, looking around, all you see are blue eyes and blonde hair, which makes people feel as if they are in a foreign country.</p>
<p>The coffee here is not expensive, only a thousand or so yuan, but the cakes cannot be considered cheap. Each piece has a different price, about seven or eight thousand yuan a piece. But these are indeed made by them, and the taste is very good. There are a total of three or four Russian waitresses, who not only have to serve customers, but also have to serve customers who come to buy cakes separately.</p>
<p>The business is not very good, which makes it seem quiet and lovely. At least you won't run into some vulgar customers who shout loudly and talk loudly about market prices. "Stealing half a day of leisure," this is a pretty good place to go.</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon"</h3>
<p>— Ma Gao</p>
<p>This film will be officially released soon. The reporter happened to catch a preview and was deeply moved after watching it. Not only because it depicts the hardships suffered by educated youth in this era, but also because the reporter personally experienced the XuZhou breakout, the Changsha Victory, and the Xiang-Gui retreat, which are large events in the War of Resistance against Japan. In addition, I was also a member of the performing arts troupe and have personally experienced it, which makes me feel especially close.</p>
<p>This is a bloody and tearful history of countless small characters of the great era who devoted themselves to the War of Resistance and engaged in cultural performance work. The author uses the characters of Li Bin and Ling Yu to thread through nine years, from the city to the countryside, from the battlefield to the wartime capital, and even to the post-"bitter victory" repatriation to Shanghai. He extracts a few characteristic stages of their nine-year life in a summary fashion and records the life, work, and education of some young friends around them. It can also be said that it is a "history of the performing arts troupe." Therefore, it makes people feel that there are too many side branches and leaves, long and lacking in the power to develop characters. If the personalities of the two characters Ling Yu and Li Bin are more prominent and vivid, the degree of emotional appeal will be deeper and more profound.</p>
<p>Intellectuals are the most sensitive and the most courageous. They are the first to feel the tide of every era, and they are the first to throw themselves into it regardless of everything. However, they are also very fragile and often easily retreat. Of course, it is not to say that all intellectuals will retreat. Like the group portrayed in this film, they stick to their posts without seeking fame, unmoved by profit and desire. (The fact that the performing arts troupe still exists today is the best proof). However, in recent years, many friends who once lived bravely have not only had their lifestyles changed under the cruel reality, but even the thoughts and desires that once surged in their hearts have cooled down and gradually turned a big corner. Then, this film will provide you with some memory material from the past, allowing you to face your own weakness and criticize the present.</p>
<p>On one side is obscene and shameless, on the other side is serious work. In addition to the soldiers who risked their lives in battle, the cultural workers who worked diligently with their conscience contributed the most during the War of Resistance against Japan. But now, who has the fruit of victory fallen into? What kind of image has the beautiful scene of victory that has been fantasized about day and night for eight years become? Cultural workers are still living a life of torment, all of which is thought-provoking.</p>
<p>This film is a good film worth introducing to the audience. Whether it is acting, directing, or cinematography, it is very upright and has put in some effort. Mr. Shi Dongshan is an accomplished, well-known, serious film worker, and having such success is very reasonable. Now that we have seen this film, we feel that Chinese cinema is not hopeless, and that the power of Hollywood will not forever occupy our market. Because it has not yet been officially released, this is just an introduction.</p>
