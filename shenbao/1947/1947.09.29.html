<h3>結束北巡十日行程　張院長過濟返扺京　最近將再視察華南台灣</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕行政院長張羣廿八日下午六時廿五分自津經濟專機返抵京，渠係於十</p>
<p>九日離京者，在東北，華北視察十日，今始結束其行程。張氏之出巡，爲行政畏官視察邊遠地</p>
<p>區之第一人。張氏乘建國號專機於上午十一時許自津起飛，一小時後抵濟，勾留四小時，會參</p>
<p>加魯省府工作會報，有所指示，下午四時梵機南飛，六時廿五分抵京，專機降落明故宮機塲，</p>
<p>政院秘書長甘乃光，副秘書長浦薛鳳在機塲迎接。張氏下機後，會笑謂：「我如魏德邁一樣，</p>
<p>帶着許多材料回來」。旋與歡迎者招呼後，返官邸休息。據張氏隨行人員稱：張氏此行，生活</p>
<p>緊張，視察工作認眞，即在飛行中，亦手不釋公文，　加批閱，其隨行人員每日睡眠時間僅三</p>
<p>小時，張本人睡眠時間亦不及六小時，然每至一處必有所指示，尤對政治經濟建設垂詢甚詳，</p>
<p>俾各地實况力求充分了解。張氏此行，在經濟方面言，特別重視塘沽新港之　築，俾以大同之</p>
<p>煤貫平綏路而抵新港，使成為華北經濟之連鎖。張氏視察新港時，適値天雨，惟渠仍待傘　雨</p>
<p>而往，興趣極高，因新港完成後，大同之煤可外銷，年獲三億美元之收益，而大同煤產實佳最</p>
<p>豐，可廣銷東南亞而無處，是故張氏對新港之建築極為注意，亦可謂為　次視察中僅次於政治</p>
<p>之一車點。至外傳整頓東北流通券問題，張氏在東北時亦曾提及，惟尚待研究，此事與改革弊</p>
<p>制決不相關，就政治方而言，張氏認為，東北人民均極　實真誠，過去因接收人員之不能自愛</p>
<p>，政策方針之容有未當，曾使廣大東北人民感受痛苦，對紊亂現狀多所不滿。今陳誠出主東北</p>
<p>軍政，銳意整頓，氣象已為之一新，在視察中所至之處，羣衆夾道歡迎之熱烈，其　況實愈遠</p>
<p>愈甚，極為張氏所感動，張氏認為東北同胞較京，滬同胞為年青。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕據悉：張陡升　　期內將作第二次出巡，視察華南，台灣各地區。</p>
<h3>發表五點觀感注意人才實邊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕張院長廿八日不午六時</p>
<p>廿五分返京後，發表其書面北行觀惑云：「本人</p>
<p>此次視察東北與華北，所得的感想，約可分爲下</p>
<p>列五點：　東北與華北是中國的生命錢，不獨因</p>
<p>爲國防地理的關係，更因經濟資源的關係，政府</p>
<p>與人民對此必須具有共同之認識，以最大的決心來恢復東北，安定華北。因為資源是　天的，</p>
<p>中國如不能確保北方豐富的資源，我們即使有人力，財力與智力，國家　設也無所憑藉，這就</p>
<p>是政府為什麼把多數精銳部隊用來安定北方，用最大的財力來建設北方的道理。　本人此行，</p>
<p>所到都是曾經長期淪陷的地區，人民痛苦已極，然而他們愛護國家，擁護政府，却特別熱烈，</p>
<p>使我感念到愈到邊地，人民愈可愛，樸厚蓬勃精神，愈顯得年青，孟子說過：「生於憂患，死</p>
<p>於安樂」，東北華北的人民，是憂患餘生，然而他們却正是「生」於憂患。　此行視察幾個大</p>
<p>規模的工　事業，凡是共　所到的，都　最破壞，看來真是觸目驚心，共匪殺人的殘忍，也一</p>
<p>天兇惡一天，難民紛紛逃到政府統治區中來。東北，華北的人民，談起共匪，又憤恨，又恐懼</p>
<p>，因此，共匪的宣傳，愈近匪區愈不生效，我們動員戡亂的工作，也愈近匪區愈著成績。　在</p>
<p>東北，華北有許多卓越的軍政首長，更有許多忠勇刻苦的輔弼人員，服務工　及交通事業，工</p>
<p>程的員工其為事業奮鬥的精神，與在前方作戰的官兵無異，　是是令人佩慰，但地方上特別是</p>
<p>邊地人才仍患不夠用，我以為中國人才太集中都市，形成「邊虛中滿」的病　，古來有「實邊</p>
<p>」之說，今天中國應該注意「人才實邊」，使文化經濟發展平衡，不獨是國防上的意義。　北</p>
<p>方人民因為愛護國家，擁護中央，對於政府期望特高，有些處所對中央指施問或不能充分了解</p>
<p>，不免隔閡，尤其因困於財政，許多工作力不從心，不免煩悶。中央此後應特予注意，務使上</p>
<p>情下達，下情亦能上達，彼此困難清楚了解，法令亦必須合乎實際，而後政治之革新與國策之</p>
<p>遂行，乃能一德一心，共力以赴」。</p>

<p>以减輕山東人民之痛苦？答，中</p>
<p>央已集中軍事政治等一切力量，</p>

<h3>蔣夫人返京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕蔣夫人</p>
<p>廿八日下午四時廿分由滬乘機返</p>
<p>京。</p>
<h3>旅京蒙人建議中樞　請確定安邊政策　保障盟旗制度以解紛擾</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕在京</p>
<p>古人土，頃爲處理當前蒙古問題</p>
<p>，聯合向最高常局及各院部會呈</p>
<p>送建議　一項，參加簽名者爲國</p>
<p>大蒙古代表，蒙古參政員，蒙古</p>
<p>各盟旗駐京代表，蒙古旅京同鄉</p>
<p>會·蒙古青年聯誼社等。該建議</p>
<p>書指出，內蒙盟旗情形紛亂之原</p>
<p>因，無非由於中央對內　之基太</p>
<p>方針尙未確立，蒙古歷久相安之</p>
<p>盟旗制度，未得明確保障所致。</p>
<p>爲辨明是非，解除蒙民痛苦，消</p>
<p>弭邊疆糾紛起見，特建議四點：</p>
<p>對於自治之解釋，並請政府根</p>
<p>據憲法早日確定對於內蒙之基太</p>
<p>辦法，蒙胞所要求之自治，只爲</p>
<p>减除邊省中間隔閡，加緊蒙族與</p>
<p>中央之聯繫，故其重點僅在希望</p>
<p>所有各盟旗能直接隸　於中央，</p>
<p>而蒙胞所要求之自治，本黨文獻</p>
<p>早有規定，是則蒙胞要求中央實</p>
<p>踐諾言，實行憲法，自屬正當。</p>
<p>對於盟，旗之解釋，旗爲縣級</p>
<p>之地方行政單位，盟爲旗以上之</p>
<p>地方政府，希望中央確實保障盟</p>
<p>旗制度；蒙地盟，旗等於內地省</p>
<p>·縣，自歷史上言之，盟，旗各</p>
<p>有其充分的行政權力，獨特的行</p>
<p>政系統，除服從中央政府之政令</p>
<p>外，其他任何地方政治機關，均</p>
<p>無直接千涉之　。邊有方面否認</p>
<p>盟爲旗以上之地方政府，或僅稱</p>
<p>之選舉區域之設，確爲故意曲解</p>
<p>事實之偏視，務請我政府根據現</p>
<p>行法令，尊重蒙地歷史，確立合</p>
<p>乎實際之方針，確切保陣盟旗之</p>
<p>制度與權利。　邊張不安之原因</p>
<p>，起於盟旗人民之遭受歧視，請</p>
<p>求分淸盟，旗與省，縣之權限，</p>
<p>取消不必要之縣治，以解決蒙漢</p>
<p>間之紛擾。沿邊各省自設置以來</p>
<p>，即在軍政不分的統制之下，其</p>
<p>鄙視弱小民族之心理，自不能不</p>
<p>滲入於一切政治作風之內。至於</p>
<p>蒙地各縣，原爲專事治理蒙地漢</p>
<p>胞而設立者，本無千涉蒙旗行政</p>
<p>之　，然近來各縣每藉省方之護</p>
<p>庇，利用其優越之地位，壓迫蒙</p>
<p>胞，使蒙旗之合法自治權利大受</p>
<p>越權之侵害，再加省方爲擴張勢</p>
<p>力，不顧事實上之需要與否，蒙</p>
<p>人之生活如何，强於各旗之內增</p>
<p>設縣局，加重人民之負祖，復令</p>
<p>旗境蒙漢同胞皆受其害。內蒙問</p>
<p>題之所以有今日者，盟，旗與省</p>
<p>·縣之衝突，實爲其最大之因素</p>
<p>，敢望中央早日當機立斷，劃淸</p>
<p>盟。旗與省。縣之　與境界，並</p>
<p>廢除在旗內不必要之縣局，以减</p>
<p>輕人民之負担，杜絕料紛之再起</p>
<p>。　爲加强中央與蒙古之連緊，</p>
<p>盟部與特別旗必須直隸於中央政</p>
<p>府，國府公布之蒙古盟部旗組織</p>
<p>法第五條規定：「蒙古各盟及各</p>
<p>特別旗隸屬於政院」，而今日邊</p>
<p>省人士竟有人謂盟直隸於巾央每</p>
<p>無根據，或應使其歸省政府管轄</p>
<p>者，此誠可謂故意抹殺歷史，而</p>
<p>擬滿足其消滅盟旗之私慾，且邊</p>
<p>疆之科紛皆由於政治之不平，省</p>
<p>縣壓迫盟旗，而蒙胞要求自治，</p>
<p>亦爲解脫此種桎桔，直隸於中央</p>
<p>，以資保全民族之生存，務請採</p>
<p>納蒙人之最低要求，加强盟政府</p>
<p>之組織，確定仍使其直隸於行政</p>
<p>院，以增强中央與內蒙之運繫，</p>
<p>而鞏固邊疆。</p>

<h3>對日和會初步會議　可能即在美舉行　王外長將與杜魯門會商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京甘八日電〕消息靈通方面稱：王外長在華府期間之工作意義似頗重大。魏德　調</p>
<p>査報吿之延期發表，足以證明王氏與杜魯門總統會晤時將商議向國間題。王氏將就中國立塲與</p>
<p>華府磋商對日和約會議之妥善辦法。至於否決構問題，亦將談及，王氏出國前已決定我將在聯</p>
<p>大席上對此棘手問題提出處理辦法之　議。據確息，此項建議為合理限制否決權之使用時機，</p>
<p>避免否決權繼續濫用以增加聯合國機構行動困難。此外，王氏可能伺機與杜魯門總統談及澈底</p>
<p>解決美，蘇間及其他各國間之　結。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕靈通方面稱，對日和會初步討論會議，可能於下月在此舉行，在</p>
<p>聯合國大會期是，各有關國家或將舉行非正式討論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕據此間中國官員稱，中國外長王世傑，將訪晤美總總統杜魯門及代</p>
<p>理國務　羅維特，但不擬對美國援華問題提出討論。惟稱：美國如欲討論此項問題，王氏當亦</p>
<p>願意，但中國決定目前決不首先提護此事，因感覺尚無任何　體專實可資討論也。美官員認為</p>
<p>，美高級官吏尚須經相當時期，始能將魏德邁報告加以消化運用，並開始討論調整對華政策。</p>
<p>美官員並擬利用王外長訪問之機會，覓取中國對舉行初步對日利會程序之態度。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕此間愈信，中國與美國談判後，將同意美國之建義，召開十一國</p>
<p>無否決　之對日和會。據悉，美國為獲得中國之同意起見，將不得不公開建議中之和約草案，</p>
<p>幷向中國保證和約將規定日本之軍事，經濟及政治至少須受卅年之管制。</p>

<h3>華沙的記者招待會　波蘭行第五信　本報特派員毛樹淸</h3>
<p>在華沙旅程中，使我最欣賞，最感激的，應當是波蘭的國際宣傳處，波「國宣處」　屬於外交部，和許多「司」的地位相當，處長葛羅　，一個半禿頭的中年人，講流利的英文和俄文自　自　，毫不费力，若干人　他身通六国　　，至少，我知道他的法語，也是精通到極點。波蘭外交部里的人，都稱他爲「將軍」，據說，他曾經在軍隊中躭　過一個　候，不過，他本身還是一個文人的料子，光復以後，他就一身　荷了波蘭政府最「吃重」的工的。</p>
<p>葛羅　每星期召開三次外籍記者招待會，星期一·三·五的正午十二點鐘，每次開會，都是舌劍唇槍的辯論式，我眞佩服那些英　·美同業，有那麼些尖銳的問題，但是葛羅　將軍，都能夠應信裕如。我記得我在華沙的某一個星期，三次記者會，都討論美國援歐的糧食問題，馬歇爾在華府，根據哈立遜的報吿，說波蘭糧食綽綽有餘，美國無須再行援助。萬羅　在記者會上，代表政府提出嚴重抗議，稱哈立遜的報吿爲「謊言」，稱馬歇爾的決策爲「不公平」。</p>
<p>他每次都用英文先講，然後自己用俄文翻譯。在外籍記者招待會上，英·俄兩種算是官方文字，捷克·南斯拉夫以及蘇俄的記者，都欣賞他的俄文，我們覺得他的英文實在夠漂亮，因爲語言文字和政治背景的不同，同一張圓桌上，無形中就分成了兩條陣綫，我覺得最有意思的，是桌面上的自備香烟，中·英·美·法的記者，都抽美國烟，俄·捷·南·芬等等的記者，都抽俄國烟。</p>
<p>我第一次參加外籍記者招待會的時候，許多英·美記者都望著我，並不和我說話，我記得很清楚，一直到我從口袋中掏出一包「馬立斯」放在桌面上以後，一位美國女記者才伸過頭來和我攀談。</p>
<p>但是，萬羅　將軍卻能兩面應付得都很好。第一是他的語言的天才，使他能週旋於各方面之間，第二是他的豐富的學識和機變的腦筋。他抗議哈立遜報吿的時候，特別强調波蘭今年的夏秋農作，缺乏種籽，並且舉出很多數字來，有位美國記者說：「請問，波蘭政府爲什麼不向俄羅斯拿種籽，老是要問美國要」？問話的語氣，顯然是一種幽默，上海話呌做「挖苦」，但是萬羅　不慌不忙。他說：「向俄國　嗎？我們正在莫斯科談判，成與不成，那是另一個問題」。他接著還說：「世界上有一種富的國家，有一種窮的國家，俄國和美國，戰時都是波蘭的盟邦，我們不向美國要，而反去問自顧不暇的俄國，情理上說不過去。而就美國說，厚予此一盟邦，而薄於另一盟邦，也是有失公平！」</p>
<p>第二次討論糧食問題的時候，葛羅　請了一位經管農耕及進出貿易的政府官員報吿，結論當然仍是批評美國的「徧見與不公平」，有位蒙芝加哥每日新聞的記者魏勒，剛從美國來，聽得滿頭是火，他站起來氣沖沖的說：「美國在戰爭期中，化了這麼多的金錢，這麼多生命，解放了歐洲許多國家，戰後，美國仍然化數十百億金錢，救濟盟邦，試問：還有什麼對不起波蘭，遭受你們這樣嚴酷的批評？」葛羅　笑容滿面的吿訴他：「你先生一定剛從美國來，你沒有聽到前半節，你的話很對，但不是現在所討論到的問題，對不起，請你靜一下」！</p>
<p>葛羅　是一個忠實的波蘭共產黨員，這在我宴請他女秘書安娜克利斯朶夫晚餐的時候，她吿訴我的，我伸了一下舌頭，她問爲什麼？我說：「我是一個職業新聞記者，葛羅　幹的這一行，也是新聞記者，就我同行的看法，我認爲：像他這樣一個波蘭的頂刮刮的人才，應該超然於任何黨派偏見之外」，我又說了一遍：「我爲他的參加共產黨可惜」。</p>
<p>黨派偏見會妨碍到新聞報遒的眞實性的，我記得討論糧食問題的某一次會上，有位英國記者問：「請問波蘭有沒有這種企圖，把自己的糧食開了後門，送到另一個國家，再開了前門向美國求援」？葛羅　回答說「沒有」，接著，另一位美國女記者又問：「你能担保沒有」？葛羅　怔了一下，還是說：「我用良心担保，絕對沒有」！</p>
<p>我預備在以後的通訊中，再介紹波蘭的工業和農業概況。在這里，我應該指出：共產黨的黨紀如鐵，明確地反映在波蘭，在我到達華沙的前若干星期，馬歇爾在哈佛大學演講援歐經濟計劃的時候，波蘭的朝野，特別是大部份的左派報紙，曾經大吹大擂，表示「衷誠擁護」和熱烈歡迎。莫洛托夫坐飛機到巴黎那一天，幾乎是波蘭智識份子最高興的日子，這裏面有兩種原因，可以解釋，第一，波蘭的瘡痍的局面，他們希望能藉馬歇爾計劃，得到經濟上的重建。第二，更重要的理由，是波蘭人希望馬歇爾計劃，可以無形消弭東歐和西歐的隔閡，消滅蘇俄集團和英·美集團的鴻溝。</p>
<p>但是，莫洛托夫的短短巴黎之行，粉碎了他們的夢想，非共產黨的波蘭知識份子，又重復跌到暗無天日的深淵裏，他們機敏地幻想著一幅黯淡的前途和　面。共產黨的左翼報紙，一百八十度轉過來大罵馬歇爾計劃，他們用譏刺尖刻的標題，說馬歇爾在大膽愚弄歐洲的老百姓。（未完）。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>駁史特萊克的反賠償論</h3>
<p>美國陸軍部賠償問題顧問史特萊克氏，最近在「亞美利加雜誌」，發表一文，題爲「報復即浪費」，根本反對聯合國要求德日兩國賠償，對於日本賠償問題，則更主張放棄鮑萊專員的賠償計劃，並推翻遠東委員會對於此一問題所通過的決議，俾使日本得以保留較高的工業水準，而能走上自給自足的途徑。我們看到了史特萊克氏的反賠償論，初以爲這僅是史氏個人的見解，不能代表美國外交當局對於日本賠償問題所抱的態度，似乎不足重視；但是按之史氏的略歷，渠於一九四五年十一月起，即任美國陸軍部賠償問題顧問，曾在德國任職一年，嗣後返國，又出任日本賠償特別委員會主席，並代表陸軍部赴日調査該國情形，而今竟發表這種反賠償的怪論，實在値得我們的重視。何况這種怪論，與東京盟軍總部對於賠償問題所抱的遲延態度，又可互相印證？尤其在美國，個人的主張，在報章雜誌發表之後，若能獲得大多數人民的贊同，那末就能左右美國的對日政策。所以史氏發表反賠償論，對於盟國的賠償要求，當有不利的影響，値得我國朝野的注意。</p>
<p>我們把史氏在「亞美利加雜誌」所發表的那篇論文，反覆誦讀，綜合全　大意，有下列各點：　美國不需要德日的工業設備，故美國不僅不要德日賠償，而且應該鼓勵或幫助德日，使其能夠自給自足，唯有如此，美國始能停止其救濟。　對德賠償問題，英美意見比較接近，均主張予德國以較佳之機會，使德國得以生產較多的糧食以及較多糧食以及較多的可以出口的貨物，但是蘇聯要求德國賠償一百億美元，法國也想向德國　量收括，均爲美國所反對。　鮑萊計劃　經遠東委員會通過，美國代表也曾表示同意，但是這個計劃，美國應予以放棄或加以修正。　中國與蘇聯在遠東委員會內，均可行使否決權，對於美國修改鮑萊計劃，勢必表示異議，美國爲貫徹其主張起見，唯有撇開遠東委員會。　從使將來結局造成美國單獨與日本媾和，美國也是値得去幹一下的。</p>
<p>假使站在美國人民自私自利的狹隘立場。去讀史氏的宏論，或許也能認爲言之成理。但由我們看來，史氏的謬論，如爲美國當局所採納，則不僅誤人，使他國　受不利的影響，而且將來美國勢必自食其惡果，再　成外交上的大錯。</p>
<p>第一，在佔領期間，美國在德日兩國境內，固然消費大批美元，要美國納稅人負　。但是佔領德日的目的，乃在管制德日，在軍事上要解除他們的武裝，在政治上要使其日益民主化，在經濟上抑低其工業水準，從而根本消滅其侵略的思想，並剝奪其侵略的實力，不致再發動另一次世界大戰。所以今日美國納稅人的負擔，可謂爲永久和平的代價，而決非浪費。賠償的意義，不僅在予戰敗國以懲戒，而且還在澈底毀滅其戰事工業，使其侵略的列車不能再事開動。賠償並非報復之謂，更不能稱爲浪費，美國不需要德日的工業設備，固然是事實，但決不能因此而反對賠償，亦不能因此即阻止其他戰勝國之拆　德日工廠，更不能因此而鼓勵和幫助戰敗國保持其工業水準，使其侵略野心，異日又死灰復燃。</p>
<p>第二，年來盟軍總部對日一味採取寬大態度，本報一再撰論，認爲姑息足以養奸，對於日本復興的迅速，應特別提高警覺。史特萊克一文所持的見解，與盟軍總部之所爲，完全相同。因此使我們不能不懷疑今日的美國一部分人士，已逐漸忘懷了珍珠港事件的慘痛敎訓，而在這些人的心目中，今後美國的敵人，在遠東不再是日本，在歐洲也不再是德國。這種思想的形成，實在太危險了！不僅在目前足以促成世界的分立，而且在將來足以導成另一次的大戰。觀於美國在聯合國第二次大會中所採取的外交攻勢，就可以明白今日的美國，正向著這條道路邁進。</p>
<p>第三，遠東委員會是依照莫斯科三國外長會議宣言而產生的，其唯一的任務，乃在處理對日問題以及起草對日和約。因爲中英美蘇四國是與遠東局勢關係最爲密切的國家，所以均有待命否決權的特權。否決權的存在，固然足以阻　遠東委員會進展，但爲遠東　獲公允永久的和平計，則否決權應予保留，充其量亦僅能予以限制。美國欲撇開遠東委員會，在起草對日和約的程序上，終究是沒有法理的依據的。而且步驟一亂，起草對日和約更要困難了。</p>
<p>第四，美國單獨與德日媾和之說，原係前總統胡佛所首倡，美國輿論界雖感興趣，但美國政府並不重視。今天看到史氏的怪論，也主張單獨媾和，足見胡佛的主張，在今日的美國，已漸普遍而有力了。但須知和平是不可分割的，美國果眞相與日本單獨媾和，殊無意義可言，徒然引起國際上的糾紛而已。</p>
<p>要之，美國對日政策，似有改弦更張的必要。我們要奉勸美國外交當局，不要單爲自己眼前的利益斤斤較量，而應爲整個的遠東打算。</p>

<h3>政治改革與人才問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 杜佐周</p>
<p>自然，不能說所有眞正人才都遭荒棄或亂插，沒有獲得適當的職位。可是在目前經濟惡劣情況和菲薄待遇之下，一個高級公務人員或大學敎授的收入，幾已比不上一個三輪車夫，那些堅貞自守的，就祗好忍饑受凍，坐以待斃；而意志動搖的，倒反而辦法多端，名利雙收了。曾國藩氏　息當時的政治，曾沉痛地說：「　　以爲當今無兵不足深憂，無餉不足痛哭，獨舉目斯世，求一權利不先，赴義恐後，孤憤耿耿者不可　得；或僅得之，而又屈居卑下以老，以病，以挫，以去，以死，而貪　畏縮者，果　首而上　，而富貴，而名譽，而老健不死，此其可爲浩歡者也！」這段話正無異爲今日的情形寫照。社會困厄人才，亦何今昔之相同如此！</p>
<p>我們要呼　，要改革政治，就先要注意人才問題，也就是說，要注意一般智識份子的出路問題。智識份子在中國歷史上以士大夫身份出現，是有其特殊的地位和影響的，而歷代統治者的傳家法寳，也專　在牢寵智識份子身上挖空心思。今日民主時代，秉國鈞者固已再不能抄襲過去的牢寵政策，但如果連這一點舊時對待士大夫的淺薄技術也還不如，則國家大亂之源何時可弭，　　人尋思了。</p>
<p>解決人才問題，自然基本上還得從敎育著手，但遠水難救近火，國家辦了幾十年敎育，而今日落得人才問題如此嚴重，這固非敎育本身之過，但與其寄托希望於茫茫來日的功效，又何如就已經培養出來的人才設法安頓位置，予以妥善的　　。而且，解決了這一代的人才問題，即無異爲下一代的人才培養開闢一條光明的坦途。不然，人才一代一代的糟塌下來，對國家民族的前途，又　堪設想？</p>
<p>最後，關於人才問題的解決，端賴於維　人才的得法，筆者認爲應澈底實現下列各點：</p>
<p>放寬資格的限制：我們承認文憑委狀等資格證件是衡量人才的標準，但過於重視資格，則正如「以貌取人，失之于　」，因爲「貌」是形式上的，資格也是形式上的。眞正人才不必有資格，而有資格的也未必盡是人才。嚴格的銓叙制度，祗可對付普通人才，以杜　等倖進之弊，而對特殊優異的人才，卻須不次拔擢，俾能盡展所長，而不必拘泥於資格的限制。</p>
<p>淘汰不肖的官吏：「鴟鴞在林，鳳凰引避」，　茸不去，人才不來。從古小人和君子就不能在一道混事。所以當局如有用新人，行新政的大決心，就一定要先淘汰舊的不肖的份子，然後新人　可引進，眞才　樂於效命。整肅官箴，澄清吏治，這是第一要　。</p>
<p>廣開用人的門路：國家正途取士，莫如考試。國父提倡考試制度，列爲五權之一，眞是卓識遠見。然過去高考以及各項特種考試，要不過做了「萬緣裳中一點紅」的點綴，對整個制度尙未能發生作用。今後爲廣開用人的門路，使人才有「脫穎」的機會，自以加强考試制度的推行最爲適宜。此外如調査失業狀況，舉辦人才登記及進行職業介紹等，也是很重要的。</p>
<p>肅正選舉的風紀：選舉是進入　政的初階，競選是人才表現的機會，這不　開國盛典，應如何愼重舉行。但目前選舉風紀，太令人不敢恭維。運動聯終，耗費旣動輒累億；打架鬧事，報紙更時有紀載。這又簡直成爲金錢競選和武力競選了，與人才何關！我們爲了　　　政的荘嚴，不能不喚出「肅正選舉風紀」這一口號來，促請各方的注意！</p>
<p>提高各級的待遇：這完全不用說了。但像這次政院通過調整公務員待遇的標準，每人增加補助基本數「十萬元」，正如北大敎授們所說：「简直是和我們開玩笑」！如此「開玩笑」下去，人才不是走光，也祗有餓死光，這如何得了！</p>
<p>總之，改革政治，不能不先注重人才問題的解決，所謂「幹部決定一切」，也就是人才決定一切。我們希望政府在人事刷新上能夠大刀闊斧，眞有一新耳目的表現。這實在是我們的政治能否澈底革新的關鍵所在。從來政治家所以陶鎔鼓鑄一世的人才者，固未必眞能做到不生「滄海遺珠」之歎，而要其愛才如命，禮賢下士的作風，能使草澤之士聞風興起，而「四方莫敢不順」。故用人行政，道理實極簡單，神而明之，則百川　海，將使天下之士莫不外爲己用，逆而行之，則潰決橫溢，有不可收拾者。人才問題的復雜性又如此！</p>
<p>救救在困厄中的國內人才吧！「留得靑山在，不怕没柴燒。」人才是国家的「靑山」，我們要愛惜它，保護它，建國前途，實利賴之。（完）</p>

<h3>促成韓政治獨立　應由聯合國監視　美對朝鮮問題立塲鮮明　對蘇聯撤軍建議大致將表示贊同</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美官員感覺彼等對解決韓國問題，已獲得若干眞正之進步。消息靈通方面稱，美國諒將於下週發表聲明，歡迎蘇聯之建議美蘇軍隊共同撤退韓國。同時，美國將加緊要求聯大會考慮韓國在統一政府下獨立之問題。如目前之計劃能澈底實施，美國將旁敲側擊指出蘇聯之建議，事實上係接受美國在八月廿八日所主張之七點之一，當時蘇聯則加以拒絕。美國當時要求舉行四强對韓會議，並聲明美國方面對此會議目的之見解。美國要求在美蘇兩佔領區內立即選舉立法代表，在聯合國　視下，爲韓國創制憲法，美國冀求韓國臨時政府及有關諸國能恊議確定撤退在韓各國佔領軍之日期。此外，美國在八月間建議由聯合國監視此方案之一切步驟，另由盟國公決韓國應得之經濟恊助。美國一方面接受蘇聯撤兵之建議，一方面將堅持由聯合國派遣人員，監督撤退及選舉之步驟，以防止美佔領區之極端反動份子及佔領區之共產細胞可能發動之陰謀。此間一般意見認爲蘇聯忽然默認美國計劃之局部，可能加速韓國獨立之恊議，然亦可能剝奪甚多韓國所能取自美國之經濟援助。美國擬利用美蘇僵局之繼續，逼使國會同意撥發對韓長期援助。如蘇聯突然同意撤退且同意聯合國監視韓國，一般相信此間對經濟援助之興趣，可能因之减少。無論如何，美國代表在聯合國中將覓取方法，使盟國對韓國有經濟上之責任，並將指出必需之建設，同時保證美國最大限度之合作，以促成此事。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿八日電〕今日據悉：蘇聯日前建議美蘇佔領軍明春同時退出朝鮮一節，原文中「深信此次撤退，將給予朝鮮人民在盟國恊助下，自行組織政府之機會」等語。經美國專家翻譯後，誤爲「將給予朝鮮人民不賴盟國恊助而自行組織政府之機會」。以致引起朝鮮領袖李承晚等聲明，認爲結果朝鮮有發生內戰之危險。</p>
<h3>維辛斯基談朝鮮問題　主張由三强恊商　反對將該問題提交聯大</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿七日電〕蘇外次維辛斯基昨在記者招待會　上，對朝鮮問題發表聲明，其全文如下：渠稱，朝鮮問題應由蘇英美間訂立協定以解決之。記者提出詢問稱，朝鮮問題在聯合國大會內獲得解決前途如何，渠答稱，余之觀點屬於樂觀派，余信苟欲解決此問題，則須採取一項小步驟，此即將此問題自聯合國議程內撤回是也。聯合國大會不論如何，均無理由討論此問題，應由對此問題担負有某種義務之三强，訂立恊定以解決之，此三强即蘇英美三國是也。</p>
<p>吾人深悉撤銷美蘇混合委員會之恊商，並否認立即畀予朝鮮立之需要者，乃美國之建議也。余於此事所欲言者，即蘇代表團於聲明反對朝鮮問題交由聯大會討論，曾指稱，解決此問題之最妥善辦法，原爲以不由大會參加之辦法而解決之。渠幷鄭　指出事實調　，此問題不在聯大會能力範圍以內，幷涉及憲章第十一條，該條款內復涉及第卅七條內第二段解決朝鮮問題之眞正所需要者爲何，誠懇與適當履行一九四五年莫斯科外長會議所　致恊籥之義務與各條款是也。余亦可引述聯合社記者所述者及其他若干報導，以實現美蘇混合委會蘇方首席代表希鐵科夫將軍之建議，該建議即主張美蘇駐朝鮮佔領軍自一九四八年初，即同時撤離朝鮮，並將未來之問題交由朝鮮人民自決。余所能言者，即吾人認爲此係解決此問題及朝鮮問題之最善辦法。爲欲恊助解決此問題，吾人應將其自聯合國大會議程內撤銷。記者按，維辛斯基之聲明內，未提及中國深足注意。</p>
<h3>杜魯門今將與國會領袖　會商援助歐洲緊急辦法　馬歇爾昨晚飛返華盛頓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿八日廣播：杜魯門明日將與國會領袖會商渠出任總統以來最重大之問題，即美國對歐洲作過渡性質及長期性質之援助。如談判結果不幸失敗，則歐洲勢將接近災禍之邊緣矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿八日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾定今晚飛華府，俾廿九日與杜魯門總統及國會諸領袖舉行會議，而將於當日晚返此。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕民主黨參議院魯赛爾及麥克里倫稱：杜魯門總統星期一晤國會領袖時或將與其成立君子恊定，以使總統得以動用現存聯邦基金，以救歐洲燃眉之急，而毋需召開國會特別會議。魯賽爾等指出美國進出品銀行，復興財團，及物品貸款銀　，尙　有大宗游資，根據現有法律，政府雖不能利用此等資金，以供援助外國之用，但杜魯門可設法與國會領袖成立臨時恊定，以暫時動用此款，應付歐洲急需。</p>
<h3>南總理狄托　痛詆美財閥</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒廿七日電〕南斯拉夫總理狄托，向昨日揭幕之　國人民陣綫黨第二屆大會致辭，指責美國財閥，以貪　而侵略的帝國主義爲基礎，領導法西斯主義之復活運動。渠並號召世界各處之進步份子全力奮鬥，以防另一歌可怖的悲劇。狄托並曰，國際反動份子旣無能殲滅蘇聯，今乃企圖防止眞正民主國家之建立，彼等借用法西斯主義之恐怖觀念，並在各國包括德國在內，重建侵略中心，以爲帝國主義擴張基地。</p>

<h3>蘇聯對希臘問題　向聯大提出對案　要求外國軍隊撤離希境</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖二十七日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯向聯大政治委員會，提出新決議案，指責希臘應負一切邊　事件之責，並要求外國軍隊撤出希臘，以及設立特委會，以監督外國對希之援助。決議案有云：　希臘與南·保·阿三國　界間之邊界事件，應由希臘當局負完全責任；　希臘內部局勢，爲造成邊界緊張狀態之主要原因；　希臘之現狀，大部分係因外國之干涉希臘內政。</p>
<p>決義案並要求聯合國大會作下列建議：　希政府應採取措施防止邊疆事件；　希臘應與其鄰邦恢復正常關係；　希保南阿四國應訂立新的邊　公約，並解決難民問題；　希政府應採取措施，停止對馬其頓及阿爾巴尼亞公民之歧視；　撤退外國駐在希臘之軍隊；　設立聯合國特委會以監督外國對希之援助。葛羅米柯之演辭長達萬言，所涉多爲老調，如指責希臘之「法西斯」政府，對國內民主進步份子施行恐怖政策等。渠又指責美國公然干涉希臘內政，煽動內戰火原，美國竟爲希臘選舉政府，並欲使希臘入於經濟上及政治上的奴役狀態。葛氏並警吿美國，聲明於聯大不能覓得解決辦法時，若採用集體安全行動，中以使聯合國機構崩潰，而破壞國際間的眞誠合作。渠云，美國創導對希臘採取公開的武力干涉，此乃對於聯合國　構極不利而危險的途徑。</p>

<h3>英保守黨力圖東山再起　邱吉爾譴責政府　對蘇聯政策大施攻擊</h3>
<p>〔路透社愛賽克斯郡史奈爾斯勃魯克廿七日電〕英國之戰時首相邱吉爾在此向保守黨員五千人致辭，嚴厲撞擊蘇聯之侵略及陰謀，及其濫用否決權。渠云：美國今日面臨以蘇維埃軍事力量爲後盾之軍事化共產主義，皆因蘇聯政府在其邊界各國發動侵略性的陰謀以及蘇聯政府之濫用否決權以圖破壞世界人民所寄予莫大期望之聯合國機構之故。</p>
<p>邱翁同時又嚴辭譴責工黨政府，指出由於英國國際地位之劇降，人民生活水準之退落及國內經濟財政局勢之每況愈下。邱吉爾又述及兩年前渠在美國密蘇里州富爾敦發表之「蘇維埃鐵幕」演說，謂當時美國人民聞後雖感驚異，但如今日在美國重作此一演說，則美人已將視之爲亳無刺激作用之陳腐論調。邱翁對於外相貝文，備極讚揚，謂貝文之堅定的外交政策，與渠之其他閣僚在國內所爲者適成對比，於此邱翁又發表對於社會主義的痛責。渠並號召保守黨員準備隨時突然舉行之選舉，俾得選出代表全國實力及智慧的新機會。</p>
<h3>邱翁評論世界大事</h3>
<p>邱翁於述及世界最近之大事時，指保加利亞反對黨領袖貝特柯夫之被處決爲司法的殺人行爲及亳無根据的殺人行爲，並曰此事應由蘇聯負主要責任。邱翁對於政府之決定退出巴勒斯坦表示歡迎，希望撤退工作能儘速時行。渠指出英國在聖地消耗大宗金錢及人力，所得僅爲該地以及世界各地人民之惡感。渠對英國之得以支持美國維護歐洲之自由及民主，並以糧食接濟災荒國家，表示欣慰。渠並曰今日第聞美元恐慌之呼聲，要知美元乃數千百萬美國人之心血，彼等自願輸將有時甚至不盼望償還，以恊助　洋以外之不幸人羣。述及印度時，渠云該地之屠殺行爲並未出其意料，此猶不過爲今後更惡劣局勢之開端耳。</p>
<h3>艾德禮勗勉　工黨黨員　反對黨攻訏有損無益</h3>
<p>〔路透社李賽斯特廿七日電〕艾德禮首相在此向工黨黨員發表演說，囑彼等保持工黨運動發　期間之冒險精神，並牢記工黨所負之社會主義使命。艾氏指出地方複選之結果，顯示雖在當前經濟局勢之下，民衆仍繼續擁護工黨。艾氏又抨擊反對黨之以與事實不符之狀況，向國外宣揚，對於英國有損無益。首相複指出英國之　　需要採用限制措施，部份亦由於歐洲其他國家戰後復興之遲緩。亞歐國家所遭遇之問題，東　國家亦均不能逃避。渠覺蘇聯報紙之猛烈抨擊他國，可以表現蘇聯政府所經驗之困難。</p>
<h3>反對食糖運德　法國發生騷動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：昨日法國凡爾登區發生騷動。先是有食糖二桶，擬運往德國，致引起當地羣衆反對，一時秩序大亂，致警察不得不使用催淚彈。該處秩序，今日已吿恢復。</p>
<h3>法義談判　關稅同盟</h3>

<h3>歐洲關稅同盟　東歐表示冷淡</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕今日據悉：關於英，法，比利時，荷蘭及盧森堡等國發起邀請蘇聯勢力範圍東歐各國共同硏究成立歐洲關稅同盟藉以支持日前經濟頒局一節，東歐各國對於此項建議似表冷淡，最後恐將拒絕邀請。</p>

<h3>調查印尼局勢已吿竣事　領事團編製報吿　爪哇搶刦行爲仍繼續中</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿七日電〕美比澳三國全組之印尼「和平製造」委員會，不久即將開始工作，六國領事團之調查停戰令報吿，或將爲三國委員會之工作基礎。領事團人員今日已自日惹返此。據云，印尼總理夏利福　相信領事團之最後報吿，必能與印尼有利。領事團人員定週一晤此間荷方官員，將提出類似問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿七日電〕據權威方面今日訊，刻在荷印之領事團之首一電報報吿，已送抵此間，其中謂，爪哇搶刦行爲（尤以搶刦華僑行爲），仍在繼續中。据可靠方面訊：報吿內容相當令人憂慮，雖然五領事（包括我國總領事）並未指明咎由誰負，但報吿中顯已表明安理會之停戰令荷印雙方並未完全遵守。該報吿中並將搶刦華僑財產之責，歸諸印尼共和國之個人。各領事並坦白表示，渠等不能發現任何可使荷印雙方更有效遵守停戰令之實際臨時辦法。按昨晚拍發至此者，爲領事團之首一臨時性報吿，至詳盡之報吿，可望於下週內寄達此間。</p>

<h3>美重視中東局勢　伊朗或將列援助範圍　土耳其參謀總長下月赴美訪問</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉廿七日電〕此間有甚多跡象，表示伊朗不久將被列入杜魯門抑止中東共產主義之援助計劃範圍內。德黑蘭廣播稱，美國會武裝部隊委會委員十六人，昨經希土抵達德黑蘭，今晨曾與伊總理蓋凱姆舉行會談。另一被稱爲赴伊軍事代表團之組織，亦於今日抵此，明將赴德黑蘭。又美陸軍情報局長張伯倫今與駐希大使麥克維聯袂抵此。</p>

<h3>法商電車汽車昨未恢復　英商電車突又怠工　社會局長嚴斥生活指數不準確說　限令復工否則繼然處置</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法商水電公司電車公共汽車工　，未獲解決，英商電車公司一部份工人，昨日下午六</p>
<p>時亦入怠工狀態。一路·二路·五路·三路·十六路·十四路·十七路·廿路儲綫車輛，均於晚七</p>
<p>時許絡積進　停　。八路·七路·十路·十一路各綫則仍維特至規定時間。如工人繼續僵持，今日</p>
<p>將僅有市公用局公共汽車為市民服務矣。</p>
<p>法商電軍公共汽車昨仍停駛。工人二千七百餘人自前日下午怠工後聚　工會內，至昨晨八時始散</p>
<p>去。社會局於中午致該工會訓　一件，嚴令剋日復工原令稱：「査該會會長，為要求　利金等問</p>
<p>題，事前未向本局依法申請，遞行罷工，殊屬非是。現値國家總動員時期，工人不得罷工怠工、早</p>
<p>明令飭　在案，仰該會轉飭罷工工人，尅日復工，以重法令。如敢故達，即以自動退　論，准由</p>
<p>該公司無條件開除。該工會負有領導責任，並仰切實　導，毋得　延，是關至要，此令。」</p>
<p>該工會接得社局訓令後，通吿全體工友，在下午四時舉行臨時大會，　因到會人數不多。未有結</p>
<p>果。延至六時許始有九十八號售票，十七號綫路，代表理監事會向全體工友　予解釋，定今晨八時</p>
<p>再行集會，商討復工問題。</p>
<p>〔大公社訊〕英商電軍工人罷工後，社會局局長吳開先昨晚稱：此次英商電車罷工，實毫無理由</p>
<p>，工會方面，始終不知，事光更米向社會局提出任何表示。事後有少數工人　　，因生活指數不凖</p>
<p>確，始行罷工。査市政當局調査編製之生活指數，絕對正確，况代表全市工人之市總工會，亦於本</p>
<p>月中進行指數調査，共編製之數字，與市政常局所統計者，大致相同，可見其所持理由，僅爲藉口</p>
<p>而已。即使指數不確，則工入方面，亦先應向政府申訴，今突然罷工，　見有人　中　動。政府當</p>
<p>局，顧念大多數善良工人，係受人鼓動，故已限令復工，並盼工人勿再被人利用，　日復工，否則</p>
<p>惟有採取斷然處懂，決不寬貸云。</p>
<p>又據英商電車產業工會理事長仇長江談稱：昨晚英商電車之停駛原因，工會毫無所聞，純係外來</p>
<p>力量，壓迫一部份工友受其利用所致。各外勤工人將車駛入軍廠後，即行各自返家，因此無法勸導</p>
<p>，今日能否復工，尙未可卜云云。</p>
<h3>各黨要求遴派參議員　市參會電中樞籲請重加考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上星期五（廿六日）國務會議開會時，</p>
<p>民社黨靑年黨府委曾有提案，擬請修改各雀市縣參議</p>
<p>會及臨時參議會法規，以便中央　派各黨人士參加各</p>
<p>級參議會一案，業經通過，送立法院根據施政方針第</p>
<p>十二條原則辦理。聞上海市參議會潘徐兩議長認爲凡</p>
<p>由選舉產生之正式省市縣參議會，撲諸法理，不容中</p>
<p>途有遴派之參議員參加，以爲民治之玷。特於昨日用</p>
<p>市參議會名義，分電中央，請重加考慮，並分電各省</p>
<p>市參議會一致主張。茲探錄其致</p>
<p>中樞當局原電如下：</p>
<p>南京國民政府主席蔣副主席孫</p>
<p>，立法院院長孫副院長吳，行政</p>
<p>院院長張副院長王，鈞鑒：頃閱</p>
<p>本市九月甘七日各報刋載民靑兩</p>
<p>黨府委於九月廿六日提出修改各</p>
<p>省市縣參議會法規提案一件，擬</p>
<p>請依據施政方針第十二條之原則</p>
<p>，由立法院修改各省市縣參議會</p>
<p>及臨參會法規，用遴選方式，遴</p>
<p>選各黨人士共同參加各省市縣參</p>
<p>會或臨參會，至於人數擬爲省或</p>
<p>院轄市為十五人至二十人，縣或</p>
<p>省轄市為五人至十人，本案業經</p>
<p>國務會議通過，送立法院根據原</p>
<p>則辦理等語。讀之不勝驚異。竊</p>
<p>有不能已於言者：査我國各省市</p>
<p>縣參議會之法規，早經公布施行</p>
<p>，原提案以施政方針第十二條為</p>
<p>依據，提出要求修改，實與法律</p>
<p>不能追溯旣往之原則相悖。</p>
<p>遴派名額妨礙民權</p>
<p>且査所有</p>
<p>各省市縣</p>
<p>參議員，</p>
<p>皆依法由</p>
<p>各省市縣分別區域與職業團體依</p>
<p>人口比例產生，一旦中途參加遴</p>
<p>派參議員名額，直接簡接均妨碍</p>
<p>人民四權之行使，將視國家法律</p>
<p>爲弁髦，置政附咸信於何地。就</p>
<p>事實而言：無論各省市縣參議會</p>
<p>，現有之參議員，雖非各黨派或</p>
<p>社會賢達比例分配，然亦決非限</p>
<p>於任何一黨。即以上海論，有國</p>
<p>民黨籍之參議員不及百分之四十</p>
<p>，民青兩黨有無參與其間，雖未</p>
<p>加調査，而其餘百分之六十餘，</p>
<p>皆爲社會賢達或其他黨派人士，</p>
<p>則固顯而易見。</p>
<p>兩黨人士儘可競選</p>
<p>若撰舉</p>
<p>各省市監</p>
<p>委之畢，</p>
<p>原無黨籍</p>
<p>之限制，更無必以參議員爲侯選</p>
<p>人之　定。民青　黨人士，繼可</p>
<p>自由　　方式競選，似不致</p>
<p>生無從　起之說。况政府實施</p>
<p>政，原意在還　於民決非還政</p>
<p>於　　，旣以還政於民。一切應</p>
<p>依人民之意　為依　，　　參議</p>
<p>員有延長任期之說，是乃各省市</p>
<p>參議會則將依　法選舉成立之</p>
<p>故，民青則黨人土似宜努力於行</p>
<p>之促進，俾各地議會得</p>
<p>成。各黨派人士亦得早日參加競</p>
<p>選，實現參加地方議會之期　。</p>
<p>旣定法規不容更張</p>
<p>至各省市</p>
<p>縣參議會</p>
<p>之旣定法</p>
<p>規，絕不</p>
<p>容邊加更張。本會以爲國務會議</p>
<p>對本案應請　行考慮，除分電行</p>
<p>政院立法院國民政府並通電各省</p>
<p>市縣參議會一致主張外，理合瀝</p>
<p>陳各省市縣參議會法規，不能徧</p>
<p>黨派之要求，而增加　派名額</p>
<p>，以與選舉產生者相混淆，致</p>
<p>府豪立法毀法，重黨輕民之嫌，</p>

<h3>團岩邊境蠻荒歷險　中航客機罹難家屬獲骸九具運回上海　斜坡上骨殖凌亂殘缺不全</h3>
<p>去年三月十九</p>
<p>日，中航機一三</p>
<p>九號，由重慶飛</p>
<p>滬，中途失事，</p>
<p>乘客及機師共三</p>
<p>十六人生死不明</p>
<p>，迨今夏始發覺失事機係落在「團岩」種子地點，中航公司月前曾派員偕死難家屬代</p>
<p>表，專機飛至該地找尋，將全部遺骨，專機運回本市，暫存中國殯僑館，籌辦善後。</p>
<p>記者昨晤死者家屬代表陶昌，承吿經過情形如下：此次同人等代表中航二二九號失事</p>
<p>飛機家屬，前赴峨邊縣　岩山尋覓遺骸，於八月廿二日由滬出發，廿四日抵蓉，即與省府當局及有</p>
<p>關方面接洽，因進入　區，非常困難，必需於事光接洽完妥，至九月四日，方啟程向峨邊縣進發，</p>
<p>敵當時川西大水為患，公路被毀，卡軍僅能通至樂山，乃改乘人力車及步行，歷三日而達峨邊縣之</p>
<p>沙坪鎮，沙坪距　岩飛機失事處，僅山路二百華里，但須經人跡不到之「老林」，中多</p>
<p>毒蛇猛獸</p>
<p>，且蠻子出沒</p>
<p>其間，擄人賣</p>
<p>為「娃子」以充勞役，故漢人絕跡</p>
<p>，視爲畏途。余等到沙坪後，即</p>
<p>由該鄕士紳，現任四川省參議員</p>
<p>莫成之君招待，並由其弟葛朝烈</p>
<p>君爲之策劃一切，根據去年蠻子</p>
<p>張治安報吿，乘客中恐尙有生存</p>
<p>者，爲蠻掳去，當時即由葛君代</p>
<p>放「報口」，言明若有生人，願</p>
<p>放款取贖，一面由葛君派人向該</p>
<p>處蠻子首領木桿兒接洽，說明來</p>
<p>意，以免誤會。但歷時一週，迄</p>
<p>未得復，乃決定携搶</p>
<p>冒險前去</p>
<p>，由　朝威君</p>
<p>率領地方人士</p>
<p>及警察等一行六十餘人，除余</p>
<p>等家屬代表外，尙有中航職員樊</p>
<p>宇忠君，木業公司經理何潤之君</p>
<p>，及峨邊縣警察隊長蕭前勳君，</p>
<p>携有機槍，手提機槍步槍等廿五</p>
<p>挺，結隊前往，在「老林」中，</p>
<p>盡皆檜杉，高出雲表，靑竹夾道</p>
<p>，不見天日，如是者行三日，始</p>
<p>達團岩邊境，至將離飛機失事處</p>
<p>時，忽見蠻子若干人，正在鎔解</p>
<p>機翼鉛質，見余等至，即高呼「</p>
<p>雞撲地」，即蠻需將人縛起之意</p>
<p>，並用</p>
<p>蠻刀猛斫</p>
<p>，另一蠻即連</p>
<p>放三槍，幸未</p>
<p>命中，余等即開槍還擊，並將機</p>
<p>槍架起，蠻子見勢不敵，即滾入</p>
<p>林中，時正大霧　漫，倐忽不見</p>
<p>，余等乃一面令人把守路口，一</p>
<p>面乃趕至飛機失事處，檢尋屍骨</p>
<p>。該機係觸岩墜於一小平壩上，</p>
<p>屍骨則散亂於附近斜坡上，因歷</p>
<p>時已久，骨殖零亂，匆匆收檢，</p>
<p>當時因不知究有蠻子若干，恐其</p>
<p>再糾衆來犯，乃</p>
<p>匆匆退出</p>
<p>連夜趕回至前</p>
<p>一日宿營處，</p>
<p>以策安全。次日再出重賞，　集</p>
<p>志願人員，再去尋檢，結果僅得</p>
<p>屍骨九具，皆殘缺不全，與原來</p>
<p>乘客數相差甚多，因距出事時間</p>
<p>，已一年半，故屍骨零亂，不易</p>
<p>收檢。</p>

<p>演講大意如左：</p>
<p>最近我們中國經濟發生許多困難問</p>
<p>題，不獨我們自己焦急，就是盟邦方</p>
<p>面也異常關切，這一點，從魏德邁的</p>
<p>文吿中也看得出來，我們在這個困難</p>
<p>時候，提出「自力更生」的口號，所</p>
<p>謂「自力更生」，不是閉關自守的意</p>
<p>思，現在國際間關係密切，我們所缺</p>
<p>乏的物資，需要由別的國家運　進來</p>
<p>，別的國家所缺乏的，也需要由我們</p>
<p>國家運輸出去，孤立政策已不能適應</p>
<p>現在的局勢。</p>
<p>自力更生調劑貿易</p>
<p>比如</p>
<p>外匯</p>
<p>掛高，物價隨之而高，外匯抑平，物</p>
<p>價也隨之低落。又如中國是農業國家</p>
<p>，要建設成工業國家，必須購進外國</p>
<p>的機器，所以現在要談自力更生的問</p>
<p>題，就是如何調劑我們對外貿易的問</p>
<p>題，也就是如何調整輪出輸人的問題</p>
<p>。簡言之，是怎樣擴充增加我國的輪</p>
<p>出品，以換取外國輸入品，使其能够</p>
<p>平衡。中國是農業國家，百分之八九</p>
<p>十都是農產品，因此輸出方面，大多</p>
<p>數是茶，絲，桐油，猪　，在「九一</p>
<p>八」前大豆佔輸出第一位。在廿六年</p>
<p>的時候，中國的輪出與輸入已相差無</p>
<p>幾，不幸戰事發生，綿延八年之久。</p>
<p>輸出品質必須精良</p>
<p>勝利</p>
<p>後又</p>
<p>逢國內變亂，因此近來入超甚巨，去</p>
<p>年最慘的一月，入超述百分之九十，</p>
<p>即出口貨僅値百分之十，而進口貨達</p>
<p>百分之一百。最近依照海關公佈，入</p>
<p>超約爲百分之四十五，表面看來好像</p>
<p>情形轉好，實際硏究起來，因爲外匯</p>
<p>限制使用，有許多奢侈的或價値太巨</p>
<p>的物品都暫時停止進口。這樣一定有</p>
<p>人要問，那我們將輪入降低，不她可</p>
<p>以與輸出平衡了嗎？不知道這是不可</p>
<p>能的，談到建設，非輸進機器不可，</p>
<p>發生災荒，非輪進南洋的米，印度的</p>
<p>棉不可，降低輸人旣不可能，那只有</p>
<p>盡力設法擴充輸出，這就發生了質與</p>
<p>量的問題，輪出品的質必須精良，要</p>
<p>科學化，例如台灣的茶葉，經過科學</p>
<p>的焙製，運到美國和加拿大，頗受歡</p>
<p>迎。假如中國本土，都用科學方法焙</p>
<p>製，那茶葉在對外幟出不她要大量增</p>
<p>加嗎？</p>
<p>收購農產顧到成本</p>
<p>從質</p>
<p>的改</p>
<p>良來擴充對外貿易，是根本的辦法，</p>
<p>但是太　了，救急的辦法，是要量的</p>
<p>方面能　　　，這裏有一個簡單的辦</p>
<p>法，就是濃民生產的東西在收購時要</p>
<p>顧及到他的成本，對於一件濃產品，</p>
<p>其生產過程中，人工，肥料，資本和</p>
<p>利息，都要精密的計算在內，以此成</p>
<p>本去向農民收購物資，他們自然樂於</p>
<p>賣出，不需勸導他們增加生產而自然</p>
<p>會增加起來，如果不夠成本，強行收</p>
<p>購，則農民們寗可把茶樹，桑樹砍了</p>
<p>當柴燒，呌他們做賠本生意是不肯的</p>
<p>不舉外債進行建設</p>
<p>因此</p>
<p>政府</p>
<p>如欲增加生產，擴充國外貿易，對於</p>
<p>農產品的成本須有詳細的調査，這是</p>
<p>洽標的辦法，也是增加數量的辦法。</p>
<p>對外貿易擴充了，我們可以拿我們的</p>
<p>農產品換得外國的工業品，這樣，就</p>
<p>是不舉外債，同樣可以進行建設，道</p>
<p>是經濟上自力更生的正確意義，把</p>
<p>這一個正確的意義，就是要設法改進</p>
<p>我國農產品的質與量，增加輪出，以</p>
<p>突破當前的經濟難關。</p>

<h3>舞業憂鬱酒樓繁榮雞鴨狂漲月餅暢銷　節約逢佳節反響各不同</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫</p>
<p>〕在全市舞</p>
<p>兩次緊急大</p>
<p>會，三度大規</p>
<p>請願之後，</p>
<p>一側舞廳經理</p>
<p>曾經若有所失</p>
<p>似地說過：「</p>
<p>看到這兩天一</p>
<p>輪姣潔將圓的</p>
<p>明月，我們心</p>
<p>裏實在有難言</p>
<p>的悽楚。每年</p>
<p>從中秋到聖誕</p>
<p>，是舞業的一</p>
<p>段黃金時期；</p>
<p>現在正當大家</p>
<p>歡欣鼓舞迎接</p>
<p>中秋的時侯，</p>
<p>而我們却掙扎着渡越生死存亡的難關！」</p>
<p>這段話說得是够憂　。在最近短短的一</p>
<p>月中，他們已捐棄了卅餘年來苦心經營的</p>
<p>光彩與豪華：霓虹拆除，花籃絕跡，芳馨</p>
<p>的香檳不復再見，絢燜奪目的純銀器皿也</p>
<p>開始塵封。現在舞場以內是確實「節約」</p>
<p>起來了，但是場外呢？</p>
<p>時裝店有近千萬元一襲的秋裝，飯館內</p>
<p>有二百萬元一席的　盛筵席，舞客和舞女</p>
<p>在場內未能盡興，自然這些就都成了他們</p>
<p>理想的去處。飯館內有的是海參魚翅，有</p>
<p>的是陳紹花彫，如果要留連賈醉，依舊可</p>
<p>以恣意大嚼，雖然這都是節約聲中明令限</p>
<p>制的。</p>
<p>舞塲</p>
<p>的節約意外地造成了酒樓的</p>
<p>繁榮，但　也衹限於三十幾</p>
<p>家較大的酒樓菜館，全市七百餘家普通飯</p>
<p>店正在恐懼　節約所帶來的「不准收取小</p>
<p>賬」的咸脅。售賣客飯的店家，堂倌是不</p>
<p>支薪給的。小賬來源一斷，引起了勞資糾</p>
<p>紛又怎麼辦？</p>
<p>飯館</p>
<p>業對於中秋佳節，一般地說</p>
<p>來是不感興趣的，這正和月</p>
<p>餅商所懐有的苦悶相同。去年他們有寳塔</p>
<p>月餅，兵艦月餅，堂皇當麗，替上海裝飾</p>
<p>過團田美滿的　恣，而今是事過境遷，一</p>
<p>只標價五十萬元的「雲裳仙月」已經獨步</p>
<p>全市，旁觀的人未免感到描興，老　自然</p>
<p>更覺得寒傖，於是傳命夥計們一律張開了</p>
<p>笑臉，抱愧似地向駐足的人解釋：「因爲</p>
<p>遵守限價的命令啊！」最後又補充了一句</p>
<p>：「明年準可以做一只頂大的，頂漂亮的</p>
<p>！」</p>
<p>顧客</p>
<p>們不知是否因為受到了這種</p>
<p>招徠術的「感召」，搶購月</p>
<p>餅的人像瘋狂了一樣，五盒，十盒，椰蓉</p>
<p>的，棗泥的，櫃台上堆積的「餅山」逐漸</p>
<p>矮下去，一位主婦模樣的顧客還焦急的說</p>
<p>：「快一點啊！我今天要趕上送禮呢，遙</p>
<p>一天又要被人家說不恭敬了！」</p>
<p>大槪收禮的人並沒有因為節約就實行</p>
<p>謝或　　，所以　鴨也由八千元漲到二萬</p>
<p>四千一斤。豬肉也跟着漲起一倍，蔬菜，</p>
<p>油，糖，開門七件，無一不漲。大家都不</p>
<p>肯在「節約」前面低頭，說他們都有準備</p>
<p>對月持撙的雅興吧？其實提襟見肘，大多</p>
<p>數的人日子過得都很窘迫。說他們對佳時</p>
<p>令節不過虛應故事吧？十個送禮的人就有</p>
<p>九個會鄭重地說：「因爲現在節約啦，否</p>
<p>則禮物更應該從　點呢！」</p>
<p>真正</p>
<p>對節約運動感到焦慮的，是</p>
<p>一些點　在婚喪　慶中間的</p>
<p>樂隊，以及許多新興的紮製花籃花圈的工</p>
<p>匠。他們都在担心着中秋以後的命運。有</p>
<p>一次他們很感慨地說：「從前淸朝一個七</p>
<p>品小官，手下着實養活不少閒人，抬轎的</p>
<p>，喝通的，開儀門的，升砲的……他們都</p>
<p>是數代相傳的職業。後來這些執事一吿廢</p>
<p>止，他們的整個家族便都陷入絕望的悲哀</p>
<p>中了！」說話者的意思是要　喩他目前的</p>
<p>遭遇，但是旁聽者中有一位插口說：「那</p>
<p>些人在廢止了職業以後並沒有完全自殺或</p>
<p>餓死啊，我親眼看見過他們的子孫不少改</p>
<p>行發財的呐！」</p>
<p>所有的人都在擾擾攘攘地渡着中秋，中</p>
<p>秋的圓月也將一年一度地普照着這些人們</p>
<p>－不管他們是歡樂還是哀愁！</p>

<p>熟心的人們，又復展開了助學的工作。</p>
<p>這回　先生慨捐了三千萬元，使「讀者助學金」增加了一枝生力軍，在個人的捐款中，</p>

<p>我們在這裏，謹代無數淸寒的苦學生，向　先生陸先生（按：又是陸守倫先生經募的）</p>
<p>致祟高的謝意。（編者按）海上名書畫家馮超然先生特地爲我們作了一幅山水畫，並指定</p>
<p>這幅畫要贈與捐款最多的人，以示崇仰紀念。現在「讀者助學金」將近結束，事實昭示我</p>
<p>們，這幅名貴的山水畫，謹敬奉贈與　永毅先生，馮先生的作品，我想讀者們一定是很熟</p>

<h3>跳蚤在山東</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日訊〕當國軍逼近營西　縣時，城裏王姓夫婦在就寢時悄悄地談說：「中央軍快到了！」第二天兩夫婦被捕，匪軍用繩索捆着她倆的大拇指高吊在大樹頂上拷問：「現在讓你們看見中央軍了！」然後割斷繩索，整地斃命，這個罪與罰，呌作「望中央」。</p>
<p>這件事是國府主席特派戰地視察官何志浩吿訴記者的，何氏奉派視察山東戰區，歷時兩月，頃自前綫返京，接見記者國軍攻克肥城之前，共匪召開民衆大會，討論提案</p>
<p>將燒全村</p>
<p>舉手表決時主席宣言：「共產黨是講民主的，作一件事要徵求大家同意，現在要燒房子，。大家是否贊成？」羣衆惶恐不答。主席又說：「共產黨是最講民主的，燒房子一定要通過大家的意見！」羣衆更加惶恐，相顧無語。　時主席漲紅了臉瞪着眼厲聲喊說：「共產黨是最講民主的，燒房子也是替人民謀福利，民衆的事總得要民衆同意，但是上了年紀的人思想總是落後，且看新生的力量兒童們的意見如何？」於是「兒童隊」舉手贊成，作為多數通過，這是共黨的「民主」一例。如果創說德橫克拉西政治理論的古希臘哲人知道今日中國共產黨是如此的使行「民主」定要啼笑皆非！</p>
<p>「分房」是具有誘惑性的，口號，窮人們初聽到，喜形於色，但共匪却有「均富」的奇怪辦法：羣衆集合在大廈前面，經過了開會表決之後，房屋立刻拆散，淸算的對象變成了一片瓦礫，鬥爭的羣衆分得了碎磚斷柱，共匪又作完一椿破壞工作了。這樣「均富」造成山東許多城鎭十城十空的慘狀。</p>
<p>民衆最怕的是共匪</p>
<p>淸查戶口</p>
<p>在淸查之前，預先派匪偷進屋內，到夜裏，淸查隊在外面打鬥，高喊「查戶口！」這家于要是想藏起一個壯丁，隱藏一些糧食，凖會給那個躱在屋內的匪看得一明二白，結果免不了嚴厲處罰。</p>
<p>駐紥沂蒙山區的某師長在招待視察官們時說：「諸位在前綫撞來撞去，接觸的盡是大兵，現在給諸位一點調濟，請諸位看一看女人！」果然，衛兵奉命帶來了一個女人，大家一看，幾乎嘔起來，那是該師在匪軍中俘獲的一名</p>
<p>俄國老婦</p>
<p>穿一件中式旗袍，滿身污濁，面部毫無表情，任你盤問，不發一方，老醜我齷齪，有如格林童話中的女魔，搜她身　文件，知道她會在東北活動過，如果她　的不會說中國話，她在匪軍裏工作一定要有翻譯官了，也一定不單只是她一個俄國人！</p>
<p>俘獲匪軍的作戰命令裏有一段是：「有什麼槍，打什麼戰，對什麼敵人，打什麼戰，在什麼時間地點，打什麼時間地點的戰。」看來，陳毅這個傢貨只是</p>
<p>國軍在沂蒙山區匪軍中俘獲之俄婦（少川寄）</p>
<p>專打爛戰</p>
<p>他的主力一直在尋找國軍的弱點，企圖在運動戰中收穫殲滅戰的效果，但是共產黨包着糖衣的毒丸，給山東佬吃夠了，反斷送了它自己的政治生命，「解放區」裏的老百姓不要你！不怕你掀出什麼「望中央」的嚴刑峻法來，他們還是要望中央！打倒毛澤東，大家都有功」的民歌擊中，配合着忠勇國軍的推進，光復了數十個暗無天日的「解放區」城村，現在　境殘匪只能作跳蚤式的雙擾，短期內不難解淸。（特約記者杭少川）</p>

<p>事實：</p>
<p>劉克明·蒲王舟·彭恒達因掃地</p>
<p>·張紹雲均係第二十九軍官總隊隊員，於本年四五月間先後退職，逗留江蘇吳江縣，組織帮會，該蒲王舟携眷寄居該縣同里鎭西岸五號鄒吳氏家中販毒為生，深知東鄰陳氏家道小康，其夫逝世，子侄經商在外，家中僅陳氏及其女鄒月娥二人，人口孤單，無力抗禦，蒲王舟遂與劉彭張及該總隊第五大隊第十七中隊隊員周天泉等夥謀行刧，設計於本年六月四日下午四時許，先由劉克明前往鄒宅，偽稱租賃房屋無着，經將行李寄存，以為晚間入室之藉口，陳氏母女因疑生慮，比囑其堂侄鄒秉成於是夜歸宿作伴，當晚九時左右，劉克明·周天泉·蒲王舟·彭恒達·張紹雲·彭明·李鵬雲·陳立中·　　　·　　嘉·胡占　·廖氷明等携帶槍械同往實施，聲稱索取行李，鄒宅果中其計，開放大門，匪等先後擁進五人，彭恒達一面越墻跳進內室，夥匪立即脅迫鄒秉成呌開二門，由蒲恒達·同天泉等將陳氏女及鄒秉成夫婦一併捆綁，因鄒月娥大聲呼救，劉乃用衡尺搗棉花堵塞其口，復施强姦，月娥致被窒息身死。　等當刦去　阿氏家金戒七只，金鐲一個，鄒秉成金戒一隻後，逃逸而去。經鄒陳氏報由吳江地檢處，驗明鄒月娥係生前被强姦竄窒息死塡書在卷，第二十九軍官總隊據報，會同同里鎭鎭長將同天泉，蒲王舟，彭恒達，張紹雲，劉克明及嫌欵犯蒲潘氏，劉國璋，劉俊，張亦　等先後逮捕　解到案。</p>
<p>槍斃了的五犯　劉克明　蒲玉舟　彭恒達　張綛雲　周天泉</p>
<p>本件理由分述於後：</p>
<p>（甲）劉克明，蒲玉舟，周天泉，彭恒達，張紹雲部份：訊據被吿等對右列事實雖狡不吐實，但卷查周天泉在軍官隊供稱：「那天快黑了，在大橋上碰到劉克明後，又遇見蒲玉舟，彭恒達，張紹雲，彭明等，同到鄒家去，劉克明呌門的，一個老奶奶開門，大家都進去了，碰到老太婆，劉克明就找鄒月娥，先和他吵後，用拳頭打她，她跑了，劉也跟進去，彭恒達和劉克明二人，把她捆起，蒲王舟張紹雲二人站在門口，其餘站在天井，是劉克明捺住她，（指死者）用尺基棉花的」，（見軍官隊卷六月十一日筆錄）劉克明供稱：「六月三日在蒲王舟家，由蒲說起，鄒家沒甚麼人，存的金器現鈔很多，我們可去幹一幹，發點財，到四日早晨，計劃晚間舉行，在蒲家門口集合，有同里兩個各帶槍枝，我與李鵬舉，范啓奎，冉啓喜，也帶有槍枝，大槪在裏面有一個鎖頭定的。」（見軍官隊偵查卷六月十二日筆錄）蒲王舟供稱：「拿被窩進去，是劉克明，他藉放被窩為名，才好晚上去，打門進去的，有劉克明，張紹雲，向我說，今晚打刦鄒家，我答覆不要傷人命，他們就呌我看後門進去鄒月娥便大喊，劉克明用棉花塞住他的嘴的，」云云（見軍官隊卷六月十二日筆錄）質之吿訴人鄒陳氏指稱：「他們先把我女兒綁在屋裏，有半個鐘點，出來一個，用手擦汗，好像他，（指劉克明）在白天拿舖蓋來的，和先由蒲家邊門過來，也是他，綁我，是這個人，（指周天泉）並向我要鈔票金子。」已死鄒月娥之堂嫂鄒沈氏指稱：「那天兩點鐘，　蒲家過來，我開門的，進來　房子是他」，（指劉克明）（見吳江地院卷第六十九頁）金善銓（即金小蘇係死者之姨甥）供稱：「那晚他（指周天泉）綁我外婆的，並在口裏塞棉花的，一點不錯，再查該蒲王舟販毒部份，訊據鄒吳氏（蒲之房東）供稱：「蒲家來往人很多，夜來聞有氣味，係白粉味，（即海洛因）常有　三來往，我三十歲吃過幾天，所以聞出是白粉味」，（見法院卷第六十三頁）又據彭恒達供稱：「姓冉的說的他家有白麵可買，劉克明供稱：「我在同里廳作白麵生意的講的，他家販白麵，」（見本部會審筆錄）至彭恒達雖矢口否認與為夥刦並稱那晚早已回家，並未出去，經房東開門，堪為反證等語，以為辭，然訊據彭之房東薛沈氏供稱：「那晚彭是天黑就出去的，到十一點鐘才回來的，」且經鄒秉成指稱：「那裏有兩個張紹雲，我是三·四·五號，住蘇州金城飯店廿二號，六號，住老閭門一四五師留守處，（見鎭公所原卷）又稱住留守處傳令兵田雲處，（見處卷　第廿八頁）第經詳核金城飯店循環薄，旣無張紹雲住宿之登記，旦查該一四五師留守處亦無田雲其人，（見吳江縣政府八月十九日代電）再據張亦尋供稱：「住震澤的張紹雲很老寶，六月四日晚上，我和他在震澤戲院看戲的」，再據蒲王舟供稱：「確是抓來的這個張紹雲，（見法院卷第三十八頁）云云，是該彭恒達，張紹雲所提反證，均不足以證明，且經被害人與共犯等指證歷自難任其空言狡賴，諉卸罪責，詳核全卷，該被吿等或據自白不諱，或經被害人指認明確，互為印證，其均為實施正犯，殊屬了無欵養，核其所為，周天泉係屬軍人，應成立結夥搶刦罪，巳死鄒月娥旣經驗明被姦屬實，且係劉克明將伊拖至客堂地上，半時始出，是劉為强姦正犯，已極顯然，應成立强刦而故意殺人及强刦而强姦兩罪，惟係出於一個强刧行為，應從一重論以共同强刧而故意殺人罪，蒲王舟，彭恒達，張紹雲，　應成立共同强刧而故意殺人罪，再蒲王舟販賣毒品，先後衆口一詞，自堪憑任，應成立販賣毒品罪，核與上列共同强刧而故意殺人罪犯意各俱應分論併罰。</p>
<p>（乙）劉國璋，劉俊，張亦壽，蒲潘氏部份：查劉國璋，劉俊，張亦壽，蒲潘氏等迭經硏訊，周均矢口否認有參與强刧情事，即被害人及正犯劉克明，周天泉，蒲王舟等，亦未供有共犯情事，應認為犯罪嫌欵不能證明，均應論知無罪。</p>
<p>基上論結，　依綏靖區及東北九省臨時緊急軍政指施辦法第二條第五項戰時陸海空軍審判簡易規程第一條，第二條，第一項前段第八條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段第二百九十三條第一項，陸海空軍刑法第八十四條，第十五條，懲治盜匪條例第二條第一項第六款，第八款，第九條第五十一條第一款，第八款，第三十七條，第一項，判決如主文，中華民國三十六年八月　日合議審判　審判長張　生·審判官劉夢九·杜慕陸。</p>

<h3>對胡適十年敎育計劃　程孝剛發表意見</h3>
<p>各校各有特長，華西大學之牙科，金陵大學之濃科，即</p>
<p>非北大等五校之長，發展學術，應魷共特長部門，協助發</p>
<p>展，使臻於國際第一流學術地位。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通大學新校長程</p>
<p>孝剛，日前抵滬後，下楊電信局</p>
<p>招待所，定今日上午到校就職。</p>
<p>程氏昨在該所魷記者所問，答誌</p>
<p>如次：戰後迄今，交大師生人數</p>
<p>激增，原有設備，未能配合目前</p>
<p>需要，影嚮敎學身心甚鉅，各方</p>
<p>對此均有同感。個人此次承乏校</p>
<p>政，對於以後如何發展校務，亟</p>
<p>願獲得各方面合作協助，埋頭做</p>
<p>去，事實未即一一實現，此時空</p>
<p>談無益。惟所可言者，個人及一</p>
<p>般與交大有關係之人士，均望於</p>
<p>短期內，力謀恢復交大已往之厚</p>
<p>術標準，提髙學生求學精神，敎</p>
<p>育部已尤本學期，增加敎授百餘</p>
<p>各。聯總所贈一部份　器，亦頗</p>
<p>有助於敎學之試騐。經費方面，</p>
<p>除敎育部外，並已向各方面洽請</p>
<p>捐助，期對師生福利，備可能謀</p>
<p>求改善。至於交大整理委員會原</p>
<p>已決定之各種事項，程氏表示均</p>
<p>不予更動。程氏嗣就北大校長胡</p>
<p>適之十年敎育計劃，發表意見稱</p>
<p>：大學包括部門甚廣，各校各有</p>
<p>其特長，華西大學之牙科，金陵</p>
<p>大學之濃科，即非北大等五校之</p>
<p>長，發展學術，應魷其特長部門</p>
<p>，協助發展，使璃於國際第一流</p>
<p>學術地位，不能以某一名稱，而</p>
<p>代替其地位。渠認爲科學分工，</p>
<p>愈細愈隹，農學中有植物門，植</p>
<p>物門中又有病書虫科，例如雲南</p>
<p>大理產棉極隹，其高逾人，然總</p>
<p>爲病害虫所傷，致不能大事生產</p>
<p>，其他，我國每年棉麥稻產，所</p>
<p>損於病害虫者，不知凡幾，迄無</p>
<p>人注意硏究防治，殊爲可惜。言</p>
<p>及工科，分工亦細，各校成續不</p>
<p>等，政府應就各校所長而分別發</p>
<p>展之。程氏願以此代替胡適氏之</p>
<p>十年敎育計劃，渠指出：如此可</p>
<p>以　就各校已有之基礎。易於更</p>
<p>大之發展，　使各大學有競爭性</p>
<p>，　經費平均，免有區域之爭。</p>

<h3>紡調會將會同市政當局　取締紗布囤積投機　首先檢查存量舉辦登記</h3>
<p>據紡調會負責人宣稱：調節紗布供需實施方案，業已公佈施行。該會爲穩定紗在價格，</p>
<p>決根據此一方案，嚴厲取締紗布　積投機。首要工作爲即日起，會同市政當局檢査市上紗</p>
<p>布存量。依照規定，各廠所存棉紗，以足供該廠三個月應用爲度。紗號存儲，不得超過四</p>
<p>十五日。布商存備布疋，不超過其旺月鎖售量之兩倍爲限，逾期逾量，均將予以査封，以</p>
<p>國積投機論罪。然後由政府按照議價收購，以打繫其獲取非法利潤。關於取締紗布投機交</p>
<p>易，紡關會將同市政府等隨時派員向花紗布市塲密査。如發現有　斷投機買空賣空等行爲</p>
<p>，即予檢舉懲處。至舉辦花紗布存貨登記，花紗布業商號登記，棉紗複製工業登記，即將</p>
<p>分別進行辦理。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價辦法推行至津漢粵</h3>
<p>紡調會爲抑平棉紗價格，對棉</p>
<p>紗議價辦法，將推行至天津，漢</p>
<p>口，廣州三地。由該會上述三地</p>
<p>分設機構，依照上海標準辦理。</p>

<p>及利潤。如當地生產者，參照當</p>
<p>地生產成本及市塲行情議價，報</p>
<p>由該會備核，短時間內即將實行</p>
<h3>黑市不能消滅僑匯難入正軌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士表示：七</p>
<p>月份之僑匯總額，爲美金十九餘</p>
<p>萬元，八月份尙未統計，但佔計</p>
<p>無大增减。此項數字較之外匯未</p>
<p>掛牌前爲多，但未達預期之希望</p>
<p>，關鍵所在即爲黑市與牌價未能</p>
<p>一致。特別以接近我國之地點如</p>
<p>菲律賓及南洋，對黑市與牌價之</p>
<p>差額，尤爲敏感。同時僑匯之流</p>
<p>入黑市，已成習慣，扭轉亦非一</p>
<p>日之事。又據專家之估計，戰前</p>
<p>我國之僑匯，十分之七來自南洋</p>
<p>，十分之三來自英美，在太平洋</p>
<p>戰爭期內，南洋全境淪陷，但我</p>
<p>國每月之僑匯收入，仍在一千萬</p>
<p>美金左右。如能將僑匯導入正軌</p>
<p>，每月可達四千萬美元以上。</p>

<h3>野菊花靠墊</h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>編結藝術近年來相當發達，半亦半出於不斷的研究，半實有賴於毛絨一物應用普及之所致，除已見制於大衣，背心，童裝等外，至於裝飾品之中又能廣大利用，這是一種野菊花花紋編成的靠墊，實用於沙發，包車，汽車上之各季唯一舒適之靠背物，不但花紋見美於長，抑且色澤相映成趣，大方耐用，又可洗拆改制，不失為迎合儉約之本，美觀之能，故一般高等家庭藉此新穎靠墊，以佈置其華堂，至其他絨線結成物，如被單粗布枕套等等，無論饋贈親友，家常便用，可說是既美且特殊，一定能博得好譽，茲見將國中靠墊一式，供我同好以資參考焉。</p>

<h3>團圞月</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>一種團圞月，照愁復照歡</p>
<p>當我接到嬰子愷</p>
<p>給「自由談月刋」作</p>
<p>的封面畫，題的這兩</p>
<p>句詩，感着無邊涯的</p>
<p>帳惘。又到中秋了，</p>
<p>一年一度最據人思緒</p>
<p>的中秋節，尤其在今</p>
<p>年，這一夕，愁歡兩</p>
<p>階層的劃度，顯然更</p>
<p>形深刻化了。</p>
<p>于是，我有點厭</p>
<p>恨月，據說中秋夜月</p>
<p>是最圓也最明的。孫</p>
<p>復詩：「十二度圓皆</p>
<p>好看，就中圓極在中</p>
<p>秋。」許棠詩：一月</p>
<p>月勢皆圖，中秋明最</p>
<p>徧。」唯其在鄹最圓</p>
<p>也最朋的月照下，屬</p>
<p>于愁階啓之一的我就</p>
<p>格外撩起也可說是不</p>
<p>滿現實的思緒。雖然</p>
<p>節約聲浪唱澈了雲霄</p>
<p>，尋歡者的一頓月餅</p>
<p>還是掠奪了窮人一月</p>
<p>之糧，不過于今爲烈</p>
<p>，有什麼可說的！</p>
<p>那麼，我只有單</p>
<p>純地怕對月，厭恨月</p>
<p>，到中秋爲什麼分外</p>
<p>明和圓？當然，</p>
<p>季候的造成，本來秋</p>
<p>之季節挺淸朗，秋色</p>
<p>平分的今夜自顯出月</p>
<p>的明圓來，從前，東</p>
<p>坡嘗聞海買云：「中</p>
<p>秋雖相去萬里，他日</p>
<p>會合相向，陰晴無不</p>
<p>同，」在萬里距離的</p>
<p>天氣會相同，倒是怪</p>
<p>事，這無須探討，運</p>
<p>帶我想起東坡的一曲</p>
<p>「水調歌頭」確實是</p>
<p>窮愁階層的寫照，所</p>
<p>調「轉朱閣，低繡戶</p>
<p>，照無眠，不應有恨</p>
<p>，何事徧向別時圓。</p>
<p>」可是，宋神宗總都</p>
<p>下傳唱這新行的小調</p>
<p>，　　「又恐瓊樓玉</p>
<p>宇，高處不勝寒，」</p>
<p>居然感動而赦去他的</p>
<p>謪罪。現在，唱　裳</p>
<p>的人多少，無眠有恨</p>
<p>的人又多少，然而，</p>
<p>誰感動呢？</p>
<p>所以中秋的團圞</p>
<p>月，僅僅兒時候偎依</p>
<p>母親懐喪指點着一</p>
<p>的愛好外，我終是怕</p>
<p>對它，我明白，這關</p>
<p>係不在月，正如黎烈</p>
<p>文寄我那篇文內說到</p>
<p>上海「這裏有我的</p>
<p>愛，也有我的憎恨和</p>
<p>創痛」一樣，而懐疑</p>
<p>團圞月，似乎偏照着</p>
<p>我們的窮愁。</p>
<h3>從秋說到中秋</h3>
<p>— 危之</p>
<p>就季節說，我是更愛秋的，</p>
<p>秋草臨風，秋露晶瑩，晨起佇立</p>
<p>大江之　，四顧茫然，遠望秋水</p>
<p>與西天一色，不禁有「富貴之於</p>
<p>我，如秋風之過耳」之感。魏文</p>
<p>帝詩：「漫漫秋長夜，烈烈北風</p>
<p>凉」，是一種何等淸冷的境界。</p>
<p>夏夜苦短，秋夜漸長，蚊蚋日少</p>
<p>，置一椅小坐庭園，仰望秋星點</p>
<p>點，亦復大有佳趣。春日令人慵</p>
<p>倦，夏日大汗淋漓，冬日則僅可</p>
<p>閉窗杜門，擁被而臥耳，四季中</p>
<p>惟有秋天，令人有淸冷自如之感</p>
<p>，蕭伯納說：「人們必須挨慣秋</p>
<p>天。」挨慣了，才能欣賞秋日的</p>
<p>眞正佳趣。十九世紀的英國詩人</p>
<p>中，拜倫是較能體味秋天的肅殺</p>
<p>的，而雪萊則一味只欣賞春之絢</p>
<p>爛，這原因正在於雪萊是「非人</p>
<p>問」的，而拜倫是太「人間」的</p>
<p>了。</p>
<p>秋是收收收穫的季節，從絢燜漸</p>
<p>歸於平淡，然而又常常是最飽滿</p>
<p>，最充實的時候。從春到秋，猶</p>
<p>之乎人之由少到壯。因之，秋的</p>
<p>另一含義便是「成熟」，過此即</p>
<p>有違暮之感。秋士與秋女，雖是</p>
<p>象微人類由絢爛而枯衰，然而若</p>
<p>自覺此是必然的事，也就更能坦</p>
<p>蕩自如了。淮南子云：「春女思</p>
<p>，秋士悲，而知物化矣。」也和</p>
<p>莊子在逍遺遊·齊物論中的見解</p>
<p>相似。</p>
<p>在秋季的整三個月中，更可</p>
<p>愛的自然中秋。這是所謂「已凉</p>
<p>天氣未寒時，」最宜於與大自然</p>
<p>相親近的時候。中秋佳節與重九</p>
<p>節，都是行樂的好日子。自然，</p>
<p>在當初，中秋節是有過一段血淚</p>
<p>史的，可是時日一久，這日子就</p>
<p>變成了民間「集體行樂」的佳節了</p>
<p>。今日鄉村中尙多三日一小集，</p>
<p>五日一大集的集體行動，以便互</p>
<p>換有無，而所謂「佳節」，也不</p>
<p>過是公定的集體行樂的日子而已</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>代表中秋的好花，是金桂，</p>
<p>過此便是菊了，李紳守詩：「菊</p>
<p>迎秋節西風急」，這所謂「秋節</p>
<p>」，不是中秋節，而是重陽節。</p>
<p>正與重陽之有栗糕相似，中</p>
<p>秋的妙品是月餅，據說今年上海</p>
<p>一隻大月餅的價格，動輒在十數</p>
<p>萬元以上，這在「全家都在西風</p>
<p>裏」的公敎人員看來，母寗是一</p>
<p>種諷刺。——八月份公敎人員調</p>
<p>整薪津，就只加了十萬元，眞是</p>
<p>感激之至，一隻蹩脚的大月餅耳</p>
<p>。　月餅的創製人是劉伯溫（基</p>
<p>），其中據說是包含了一段外人</p>
<p>侵略下的漢人血淚史的。「手提</p>
<p>鋼刀九十九，殺盡胡兒方罷手。</p>
<p>」這樣的民歌，彷彿還在耳邊臘</p>
<p>蕩。然而時至今日，月兒仍然是</p>
<p>彎彎地照着大地，在吃食大月餅</p>
<p>的大腹　或達官貴人心裏，是否</p>
<p>尙有五百多年前的那段皿腥記憶</p>
<p>呢？</p>
<p>勝利二年來，我們的生活離</p>
<p>「舉國騰歡」的日子還遠得很，</p>
<p>從今日中國之現狀，遠望一下正</p>
<p>在套上「民主」的外套而埋頭疾</p>
<p>進的日本，我們更將慚愧無已了</p>
<p>，吃月餅的人若一想起月餅中包</p>
<p>含的血淚史。亦能有所感否？</p>
<p>秋是成熟的季節，可是中國</p>
<p>，你的民主之果，建國之果，將</p>
<p>於何時成熟？！</p>
<h3>人月圓</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>雖云月亮西洋好，怎</p>
<p>及我中秋？况焚香斗，還</p>
<p>餐月餅，東勝神州！</p>
<p>更添奇蹟，城歡酒肉</p>
<p>，野滾骷髏！團圓佳節，</p>
<p>應該快樂，莫問憂愁！</p>
<h3>桂殿秋</h3>
<p>— （兩闋）</p>
<p>思往日，怨良宵，嫦</p>
<p>娥心事像秋潮，難忘后羿</p>
<p>弓饒月，深怕洋人箭射霄</p>
<p>！</p>
<p>悲末刧，亂宗邦，罷</p>
<p>工拋斧注吳剛：金風狂捲</p>
<p>瘋人笑，玉露凄零餓鬼</p>
<p>！</p>
<h3>今年的中秋</h3>
<p>— 思果</p>
<p>中秋節，在江南像故鄉那樣</p>
<p>小而出名的城市裏是人們興奮的</p>
<p>日子。我們那城襄有的是玻璃做</p>
<p>的「鑾駕」，包括各式各樣的燈</p>
<p>，小旗，小傘。中秋那晚，各式</p>
<p>的燈點起，加上新鮮的石榴，菱</p>
<p>角，月餅，一家圍在一塊敬月宮</p>
<p>眞是頂有趣的事。父母親敬大月</p>
<p>宮，孩子們敬小月宮，各人趕着</p>
<p>忙，十分熟鬧。</p>
<p>這是我童年的事，那時世界</p>
<p>還沒有完全認識戰爭的延續性和</p>
<p>潛伏性，殺人和毀滅的力量還沒</p>
<p>有發展到現在的程度。人們，尤</p>
<p>其在小一些的　市裏，雖不斷被</p>
<p>內戰踐踏着，仍然欣賞節日的歡</p>
<p>愉。也許生活已經開始稍稱威脅</p>
<p>着父親了，但對我們小孩子並不</p>
<p>十分猙獰可怖。過節總得像個過</p>
<p>節，母親說的。</p>
<p>那時的情景在如今回憶起來</p>
<p>是又甜又美：燈是那們溫暖，明</p>
<p>亮，燈光從琉璃罩內射出各稱彩</p>
<p>色，一閃一閃地好看又有趣；月</p>
<p>餅是那們香，甜·好像從那時起</p>
<p>人們再也做不出那種餅了；父母</p>
<p>親除了把「鑾駕」拿出來給我們玩</p>
<p>之外，還要買許多泥人兒和新鞋</p>
<p>新　給我們。一切都是歡欣，美</p>
<p>好。而如今那情景似乎是歷史上</p>
<p>的陳跡，回憶時心中有說不出的</p>
<p>惆悵，輕淡而深銳的惆悵。這不</p>
<p>光是美麗的童年消逝，因爲童年</p>
<p>終不能久駐，而實在是童年時代</p>
<p>的那點和平氣雰不在了的原故。</p>
<p>從離開故鄕起似乎一年比一</p>
<p>年還不如。「鑾駕」早已沒有了</p>
<p>；中秋節父母親再不買禮給我們</p>
<p>了；月餅似乎越變得甜得發膩，</p>
<p>所謂運蓉也只是洋薯罷了。我十</p>
<p>七歲出外謀生，開始辛酸的人生</p>
<p>旅程。抗戰後，一直在外省受苦</p>
<p>。父母親因不慣播還的生活，相</p>
<p>繼亡故。每年中秋只是虛應故事</p>
<p>地過一下節，對那又大又凉又圓</p>
<p>又潔白的月亮心中只泛起漠然的</p>
<p>悲哀。</p>
<p>今年呢，論理勝利後回到家</p>
<p>鄕過第一個中秋該快活得很了。</p>
<p>但國內是兵亂未已，自己是被生</p>
<p>活緊緊扼住喉頭氣都透不出，那</p>
<p>有心思去賞月：抗戰時一點美麗</p>
<p>的幼稚夢已驚醒過來。世界正面</p>
<p>臨最可怖的陷阱，一不小心便要</p>
<p>跌進。猜忌，仇恨，驕傲，愚昧</p>
<p>正一天天地在滋長，誰都明白下</p>
<p>次戰爭的避免是不容易的事。憂</p>
<p>時的甚至喊出「早點打吧，早點</p>
<p>打還可保全一部份呢！」在過去</p>
<p>是田和乙有仇，打一打誰敗了就</p>
<p>平定了；如今是幾個包含全人類</p>
<p>幾分之幾的集團各掌握着一套不</p>
<p>能通融的理論，想去摧毀，如果</p>
<p>不能征服其餘的人類。這種鬥爭</p>
<p>的結果很難想像，因爲自衛和衛</p>
<p>道這兩個前提是不允許人半路丟</p>
<p>手的。但到今天還沒有一種睿智</p>
<p>產生足以消除人們的疑懼和堅定</p>
<p>人們愛人如己的信心。節令，早</p>
<p>已被人冷淡了，除非少數極富有</p>
<p>或從不關心未來的人。</p>
<p>在今天那江南的許多小而出</p>
<p>名的城市喪，中秋節還有牠難以</p>
<p>抗拒的魅力，天是淸明，月是好</p>
<p>看。然而人的心頭却是沉重。我</p>
<p>不禁爲我們這一代和下一代虔誠</p>
<p>地默禱了。</p>
<h3>中秋節在美國</h3>
<p>— 菽園</p>
<p>「月到中秋分外明」，並不因地區國別而有所厚薄，我</p>
<p>沒有說過亮月在美國比在中國更皎潔，不過同一個亮月，在</p>
<p>美國照着豐登的五穀，聳立的工廠，繁華的城市，比肩的情</p>
<p>侶·在中國照着殘斷的戰場，徧野的哀鴻，囤積的會庫，露</p>
<p>宿的遊民，那光亮更顯得抑　了。我在抗戰八年中，前四年</p>
<p>住在衡陽成都，每逢中秋佳節，敵機一定駕臨投彈，無心過</p>
<p>節，後匹年居留美國，像蘇武牧羊，對於持菊賞月，意與案</p>
<p>然。在整整八九年中未曾有多少月餅進口，滿望勝利歸來，</p>
<p>可以大快朶頤，不料法幣貶値，月餅漲價，又値節約聲中，</p>
<p>公務員不送禮不收禮，自己旣買不起，也不曾有人送來，「</p>
<p>禮失而求諸野」，且談談在美國過中秋吧：</p>
<p>海外華僑對於過節最感興趣，因爲他們終年勤勞，全將</p>
<p>節日熱閙一番，秋節將近，紐約及三藩市各大埠華僑　種舖</p>
<p>的廣式月餅及香斗，已堆得滿坑滿谷，買月餅的不限於中國</p>
<p>人，美國人也都喜歡吃Mooncake，洋太太們一面吃月餅，</p>
<p>一面便傳說甚至編造許多月裏嫦娥的故實，表示自己如何博</p>
<p>學，　然中國通了。華僑於中秋節休息一天，在財神殿前焚</p>
<p>燒香斗。幷大鬧元宵，安良堂等會館中均設有財神殿，幷備</p>
<p>全副元宵樂器，大鑼大鼓，鄕　雲霄，元宵鬧過，牌九與搖</p>
<p>攤　飛，務盡一日之樂。廣式劇院例貼「嫦娥奔月」一類戲</p>
<p>目，惟華僑靑年喜於月色下挽臂赴園林深處，度其一刻千金</p>
<p>。某年中秋節，華僑小姐邀往其家中過節，酒醉飯飽，深宵</p>
<p>覺月亮倍形皎潔。今則情况大殊，過冠生國以常屠門大嚼，</p>
<p>中秋負我歟，抑我負中秋歟？</p>
<h3>中秋月</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>今年中秋月，</p>
<p>離亂更見多！</p>
<p>爲因談節約，</p>
<p>素娥不起舞？</p>
<p>月到中秋分外明，幾</p>
<p>家離亂幾家歡？今日正盛</p>
<p>談節約，連累月中的嫦娥</p>
<p>也不再起舞了！</p>
<p>註：十州記，月中有</p>
<p>嫦娥，舞於桂下。</p>
<h3>中秋與桂花</h3>
<p>— 月鳳</p>
<p>「賞心樂事」（宋張約齋著</p>
<p>）裏說，「八月朝山尋桂，衆妙</p>
<p>山木犀，綺亙亭千葉木樨，羣仙</p>
<p>繪幅樓觀月及桂隱攀桂，」可見</p>
<p>賞月與賞桂，是不可分割的韻事</p>
<p>。桂與月之聯繫，早在唐以前，</p>
<p>如陳後主爲張歷華造桂宮於光昭</p>
<p>殿後，作圓門如月即是。至唐而</p>
<p>桂乃被移植到月球上去。王維詩</p>
<p>「桂魄初生秋露微」，說明那時</p>
<p>有人已經看見月亮裏的桂樹了。</p>
<p>砍桂的吳剛，雖然是漢人，這故</p>
<p>事却首見於唐人的「酉陽雜俎」</p>
<p>，可見還是害人的創造。郄詵對</p>
<p>策，自謂桂林一枝，於是桂樹又</p>
<p>與秋試纏夾在一起，簡直稱登科</p>
<p>爲折桂了。</p>
<p>以近代而論，雲南八月，有</p>
<p>桂花市。四川新都有桂湖，湖畔</p>
<p>叢桂，多至二百餘株，綿延里許</p>
<p>，皆數百年前物，中秋前後，香</p>
<p>達數里外，遊者塞途。吳俗往時</p>
<p>看桂，傾城皆出，如競渡時。北</p>
<p>平寳藏寺之桂花，亦甚著名。由</p>
<p>此可知桂樹是普遍種植於大江南</p>
<p>北的，一般庭院，類多有之。月</p>
<p>明之夜，婆娑桂影，甜香縷縷，</p>
<p>叙天倫，度佳節，確是至高無上</p>
<p>的樂事。</p>
<p>童時會經求敎老師，何以月</p>
<p>亮繞地球而轉，我們却老是祇看</p>
<p>見吳剛鋸樹（此乃嘉湖一帶的看</p>
<p>法），不看見月亮的其它各面。</p>
<p>那位老師眞有學問，他說月亮環</p>
<p>繞地球之時，同時也在自轉，正</p>
<p>與地球之壊繞太陽者相同。所不</p>
<p>同者，月亮之自轉，其時間恰爲</p>
<p>陰歷一月，即等於它環繞地球一</p>
<p>周所需的時間，因此它雖然不停</p>
<p>環繞地球而行，却老是祇讓我們</p>
<p>看見它，吳剛與桂樹的一面，至</p>
<p>於吳剛砍樹以後又如何，吳剛有</p>
<p>沒有妻子兒女等情，它就不讓我</p>
<p>們看見了。我說那位老師有學問</p>
<p>，因爲他乃是三十年以前的一位</p>
<p>小學敎師。這個問題後來我曾向</p>
<p>許多學地理的先生和朋友們談起</p>
<p>，他們都說沒有留心過。</p>
<h3>中秋的故事</h3>
<p>— 漢校</p>
<p>時問似乎過得特別快，一</p>
<p>眼間，又是中秋節了。</p>
<p>說起中秋，不能不敎人思想</p>
<p>到中秋的月，中秋月，在我們中</p>
<p>國，有不少怪誕的傳說，讓筆者</p>
<p>寫二段在下面，作爲紀念中秋節</p>
<p>的禮品吧。</p>
<p>嫦娥奔月　相傳民元四千餘</p>
<p>年前，夏有後羿　帝相以當國，</p>
<p>乞求不死之藥於西王母，其妻嫦</p>
<p>娥（有呌姮娥）倫吃而奔月。這</p>
<p>樣，她就常生不死，永久居住在</p>
<p>月球上面。民間把她編成劇本，</p>
<p>每到佳節，必在舞台上表演。</p>
<p>月下老人　有人以爲月裏有</p>
<p>一頭玉兎，在佛敎方面，又以爲</p>
<p>那頭兎十，是信佛敎的牠自願犧</p>
<p>牲了畢生幸福，爲菩薩而犧牲，</p>
<p>上天爲獎勵牠忠誠起見，便使牠</p>
<p>再生，才成爲月下老人。這老人</p>
<p>，就負上月神的一切使命，特別</p>
<p>是促有情人成眷屬。所以到現在</p>
<p>，還有許多迷信慈愛的婦人，每</p>
<p>在中秋那天，用白紙剪成兎子形</p>
<p>，放在女兒的鞋子襄面，這樣，</p>
<p>以爲她們的女兒，不久就可選到</p>
<p>如意郞君，因而結爲夫婦，白首</p>
<p>偕老。</p>
<h3>當月圓的時候</h3>
<p>— 未壯</p>
<p>朱人孔平仲玩月詩云：「團團冰鏡吐淸　，今夜何如昨夜時？只恐月光無好惡，自憐人意</p>
<p>有盈虧」。</p>
<p>中秋的月亮，我們總覺得她特別飽滿，格外皎潔，所以賞月一定要在中秋晚上。</p>
<p>其實十四那天的月，雖則則則還有一線未盈，但就我們的肉眼看起來，也已覺得她很圖滿的了</p>
<p>。而十六呢，事實上，中秋早成過去，可是當你抬頭望明月時，有誰能辨別得出她虧缺的所在</p>
<p>呢？自十六以後，又當別論。</p>
<p>我們對於未來的Ｘ，總抱着無限希望，以爲一切可以盡如理想；我們對於過去的一切，又</p>
<p>往往有眷戀和感傷之感。及至事過境遷，好像到了月已殘缺之時，回頭上弦半弓的情景，緬懐</p>
<p>已往，倒反增加了不少美麗的回憶呢！</p>
<p>所謂「月光無好惡，人意有盈虧」，宇宙間的一切，原不是絕對的，凡事若能退一步着想</p>
<p>，自得怡然無窮之樂，而刻意求工，貪婪無　，其結果往往只抱得了一個空虛的黑影而已。</p>
<p>老子說：「持而盈之，不如其已，揣而銳之，不可長保，金玉滿堂，莫之能守；富貴而驕</p>
<p>，自遣其咎。功遂身退，天之道載」。</p>
<p>天下事，物極必反，盛極必衰，而否極亦必泰來也。但顧常常看到到到一鈎新月，倒可以希望</p>
<p>無窮，一到十二三那天，你已漸有絢爛之意。至於十六之後，日就　蝕，更如何掩飾得住呢？</p>
<p>特盈保泰，雖是老生常談，而急流勇退，尙不失爲識時務者，賞月的人們，其有意乎？</p>
<h3>秋夜月</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>中秋佳節。淨長空，</p>
<p>凝艷露，肝陽儉結。物價</p>
<p>算盤暗撚，米鹽瑣屑。幾</p>
<p>多事，偶思憶，舊愁難輟</p>
<p>。消極；心幕今宵不揭。</p>
<p>親朋遠別，作寓公，</p>
<p>如浪子，繁華全撳。往日</p>
<p>風流春夢，曝冰熔雪，剩</p>
<p>河山（或家山），都破碎</p>
<p>。蕭條悽切。夜深怕望玲</p>
<p>瓏圓月。</p>
<h3>中秋舊俗</h3>
<p>— 湘若</p>
<p>中秋，俗呼八月半，是夕，人家各有</p>
<p>宴會，以酬佳節。人又以此夜之晴雨，占</p>
<p>次年元宵陰晴，諺云，八月十五雲遮月，</p>
<p>來歲元宵雨打燈。又云：雨打上元燈，雲</p>
<p>罩中秋月。蔡雲詩云：「胸悶中秋雲罩月</p>
<p>，曉曉元衣雨淋燈，誰知籬豆花開日，養</p>
<p>稻正雲水滿勝。」則農人與有閒者之旨趣</p>
<p>，固逈然有別也。周恭　集有「但願中秋</p>
<p>不見月，博得兀宵雨打燈」之句、藹然仁</p>
<p>者之言矣。然在玩月賞燈之雅士，將毋認</p>
<p>爲「太煞風景」乎！</p>
<p>中秋之夕，比戶瓶花香蠟，望空禮拜</p>
<p>：小兒女膜拜月下，嬉戲燈前，謂之齊月</p>
<p>宮。陸啓　北京歲華記：一中秋之夕，人</p>
<p>家各置月宮符像，符上兎立如人。陳瓜果</p>
<p>於庭，餅面繪月中蟾兎·男女肅拜燒香，</p>
<p>且而焚之。」今俗不設月宮符像，向空展</p>
<p>拜而已。</p>
<p>吳俗又有燒斗香者，香肆以綫香作斗</p>
<p>，納香屑於中，僧俗咸買之，焚於月下，</p>
<p>尤崧鎭斗香詩云：拈將香綫勻兼細，長短</p>
<p>編成斗樣同，只合靈檀和木屑，豈宜旨酒</p>
<p>存瓊宮，佳人撤帳腰頻折，處士占星柄自</p>
<p>空，吳俗中秋傳韻事，滿庭馥桂正臨風。</p>
<p>又云：愧無麗藻拾山香，才思難將此物量</p>
<p>，燭熖衝來槎貫月，檀心陷處胆如囊，烟</p>
<p>榮尙結科文細，灰燼猶留印樣方，深夜羣</p>
<p>眞倘下界，不嫌斗室詠霓裳。」杭俗，則</p>
<p>糊紙爲斗，燒香其中，高者可二尺許，吳</p>
<p>曼雲詩云：「心字燒殘寸寸灰，靈香上請</p>
<p>月輪開：斗量畢竟人間少，桂粟新收萬斛</p>
<p>來。」</p>
<p>婦女盛妝出游，互相往還、或隨喜尼</p>
<p>庵，鷄聲喔喔，猶婆娑月下，調之走月亮</p>
<p>，蔡雲詩云：「木犀球壓　絲香，兩兩三</p>
<p>三姊妹行，行冷不嫌羅袖薄，路　翻恨</p>
<p>裙長。」</p>
<p>村民於曠野，以瓦疊成七級浮屠，中</p>
<p>供地藏王像，四周燃燈，謂之塔燈。蓋以</p>
<p>之照幽冥，非徒事游觀也。梅霜崖詩云：</p>
<p>「不須縮版築　嶒，一柱擎空七級燈，銅</p>
<p>雀台灰餘片片，靈光殿礫積層層，燭龍鱗</p>
<p>甲冲霄殿，蛤蚱珠璣拔地升，士女傾城齊</p>
<p>竚望，芸辰皓月景彌增。」</p>
<p>人家餽貽月餅，爲中秋節物，十五夜</p>
<p>，則偕瓜果，以供祭月筵前。祁啓　詩云</p>
<p>：「中秋節物未爲低，火　羅羅出釜齊，</p>
<p>一樣餅師新製得，佳名先向月中題。」西</p>
<p>湖遊覽志載：「中秋，民間以月餅相遺，</p>
<p>取團圓之意。」吳曼雲江鄕節物詩小序：</p>
<p>「杭俗中秋食月餅，夜設祭月，取人月變</p>
<p>圓意」。詩云：「粉膏圓影月分光，不是</p>
<p>紅綾亦飽嘗，只恐團　空說餅，征人多少</p>
<p>未還鄕。」此詩即移之今日，亦甚切貼。</p>

<h3>End of Ten-Day Northern Tour: President Zhang Returns to Nanjing via Jinan; Will Inspect Southern China and Taiwan Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Premier Zhang Qun returned to Nanjing from Tianjin via special plane at 6:25 PM on the 28th. He departed from Nanjing on the 19th and concluded his ten-day inspection tour of Northeast and North China. Mr. Zhang's trip is the first time an administrative official has inspected remote areas. Mr. Zhang took the Jian Guo special plane, taking off from Tianjin at about 11:00 AM. After an hour, he arrived in Jinan, staying for four hours to attend the Lu Province government work conference and gave instructions. At 4:00 PM, the plane flew south, arriving in Nanjing at 6:25 PM, landing at Ming Palace Airport. Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and Pu Xuefeng, Deputy Secretary-General, greeted him at the airport. After disembarking, Mr. Zhang smiled and said, "I am like Wedemeyer, bringing back a lot of materials." After greeting the welcomers, he returned to his official residence to rest. According to Mr. Zhang's entourage, his trip was intense, and his inspection work was serious. Even during the flight, he kept official documents in hand, reviewing them. His entourage only had three hours of sleep each day, and Mr. Zhang himself had less than six hours of sleep. However, he gave instructions wherever he went, especially inquiring in detail about political and economic construction, striving to fully understand the local situation. Speaking in terms of economic aspects, Mr. Zhang's trip particularly emphasized the construction of Tanggu New Port, so that Datong's coal could pass through the Ping-Sui Railway and reach the new port, making it the economic link of North China. When Mr. Zhang inspected the new port, it happened to be raining, but he still went with an umbrella, showing great interest. After the completion of the new port, Datong's coal can be exported, yielding US$300 million in annual revenue, and Datong's coal production is excellent and abundant, which can be widely sold to Southeast Asia. Therefore, Mr. Zhang paid great attention to the construction of the new port, which can be said to be second only to politics in this inspection. As for the rumors of rectifying the Northeast circulating currency issue, Mr. Zhang also mentioned it in the Northeast, but it still needs to be studied. This matter is not related to reforming malpractices. In terms of politics, Mr. Zhang believes that the people of the Northeast are extremely honest and sincere. In the past, due to the inability of the receiving personnel to cherish themselves and the possible inappropriateness of policies and guidelines, the vast number of people in the Northeast suffered, and they were dissatisfied with the chaotic situation. Now that Chen Cheng is in charge of the Northeast's military and administration, with the determination to rectify it, the atmosphere has been renewed. The enthusiasm of the crowds welcoming along the way during the inspection was even more intense the further away, which greatly moved Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang believes that the compatriots in the Northeast are younger than those in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] It is learned that Zhang is expected to make a second tour during his tenure to inspect various regions in South China and Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Expressing Five Observations, Paying Attention to Talent and Strengthening Borders</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] After Premier Zhang returned to Nanjing at 6:25 PM on the 28th, he issued a written statement about his Northern trip, saying, "My observations from this inspection of Northeast and North China can be divided into the following five points: Northeast and North China are China's lifeline, not only because of national defense geography, but also because of economic resources. The government and the people must have a common understanding of this and be determined to restore the Northeast and stabilize North China. Because resources are innate, if China cannot ensure the rich resources of the North, even if we have manpower, financial resources, and intelligence, national construction will have nothing to rely on. That is why the government uses most of its elite troops to stabilize the North and uses the greatest financial resources to build the North. During this trip, all the places I went to were areas that had been occupied for a long time. The people have suffered greatly, but they are particularly enthusiastic in loving the country and supporting the government, which makes me realize that the more remote the area, the more lovable the people are, and the more vigorous and energetic spirit appears to be younger. Mencius said: 'Born in sorrow, die in pleasure.' The people of Northeast and North China are surviving sorrow, but they are precisely 'born' in sorrow. During this trip, I inspected several large-scale industrial projects. Wherever the communists went, they were most destructive. It is truly shocking to see. The communists are becoming more and more cruel in killing people, and refugees are fleeing to government-controlled areas one after another. The people of Northeast and North China speak of the communists with both hatred and fear. Therefore, the closer to the communist areas, the less effective their propaganda is, and the closer to the communist areas, the more successful our work of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion is. There are many outstanding military and political leaders in Northeast and North China, as well as many loyal and dedicated support staff. The engineers and employees serving in industry and transportation have the same spirit of fighting for their careers as the officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines. This is commendable, but there is still a shortage of talent in the local areas, especially in the border areas. I believe that China's talent is too concentrated in the cities, forming a disease of 'empty borders and full centers.' There has been a saying since ancient times about 'strengthening the borders.' Today, China should pay attention to 'strengthening the borders with talent' to balance cultural and economic development, not just for national defense significance. Because the people of the North love the country and support the central government, they have high expectations for the government. In some places, they may not fully understand the central government's instructions, which inevitably creates misunderstandings. Especially due to financial difficulties, many tasks are beyond their ability, which inevitably causes frustration. The central government should pay special attention to this in the future, so that the upper levels can understand the lower levels and the lower levels can also understand the upper levels, and that everyone understands each other's difficulties clearly. The laws and regulations must also be in line with reality, so that the reform of politics and the implementation of national policies can be carried out with one heart and one mind."</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Inspects Paper Company Before Leaving Tianjin</h3>
<p>Agrees to Allocate More Funds for Tanggu New Port Construction</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] Premier Zhang left Tianjin for Jinan at 11:15 AM on the 28th. Before leaving, he met with Wang Chongzhi, General Manager of Kai Luan, and Shi Zhiren, Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, at the Tianjin Railway Official Residence at 8:00 AM to inquire about the production and export of Kai Luan coal and instructed the Railway Bureau to fully transport it to meet the needs of the South and the North. Then he drove to inspect the Resources Committee, the Paper Pulp and Paper Company, and China Textile Factory No. 4. He then visited Zhang Boling and Jin Yunpeng to say goodbye and inspected the streets of Tianjin City. At 10:45 AM, he arrived at Zhang Guizhuang Airport and left Tianjin for Jinan by special plane at 11:15 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] The North China Paper Pulp and Paper Company of the Resources Committee, due to insufficient working capital, requested the government to allocate 10 billion yuan when Premier Zhang visited the factory on the 28th. Premier Zhang has agreed to consider it. The factory is the largest paper mill in North China. If it can obtain the working capital, its business will be fully developed.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] Xing Qizhen, Director of Tanggu New Port, said: The government attaches great importance to the new port. According to the allocation of funds, Qingdao received 20 billion, Huludao received 40 billion, and the new port has received 130 billion. The authorities have agreed to allocate another 50 billion. The new port power plant will be completed this year, and the three warehouses in the first wharf will also be completed before the end of the year. The coal loading machine can be used when the belt is purchased.</p>
<p>[Our Beijing Correspondent, 28th] The work of salvaging sunken ships in Tanggu New Port can be completed before the river freezes this winter. On the eve of Japan's formal surrender, 42 ships of various types were deliberately sunk. Before December last year, 14 of these sunken ships were salvaged. This year, salvage work continued in April, and another 20 ships were salvaged.</p>
<h3>Staying in Jinan for Four Hours, Meeting with Leaders from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 28th] Premier Zhang and his party flew to Jinan from Tianjin at 12:20 PM on the 28th. Wang Yaowu and representatives from all walks of life greeted them at the airport. They went to the British Consulate to meet with leaders from all walks of life. Representatives of the United Association of Fellow Townsmen from various counties in Jinan presented a petition detailing the suffering of the people in Lu Province and requested the central government to allocate funds and issue guns and ammunition to assist various counties in establishing local self-defense forces, and also requested to increase disaster relief funds to help refugees. Zhang agreed to handle it after returning to Nanjing, saying that the central government is extremely concerned about the suffering of the North and Shandong, so it is concentrating its efforts to suppress bandits and quell the rebellion. After lunch, Mr. Zhang attended a meeting of various agencies to listen to local opinions and toured the streets. Due to urgent official business, he changed his plan to stay overnight in Jinan and did not go to Qingdao, and flew directly back to Nanjing at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 28th] When Premier Zhang passed through Jinan on the 28th, he answered reporters' questions: How can the government accelerate the completion of the work of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion to alleviate the suffering of the people of Shandong? He replied that the central government has concentrated all its military and political forces to engage in the work of quelling the rebellion. The purpose is nothing more than to stabilize the North, and the main force of the government army is also used in Shandong. The situation in Shandong has improved compared to half a year ago. As for the issue of liberally allocating funds for self-defense in Lu Province and guns, he replied that the Executive Yuan has decided on a plan for organizing and training local armed forces. The central government has only allocated 3 billion to Lu Province's accounts, which is too small. Please increase it. He replied that everyone knows the situation of the national treasury. Is China's economic situation very serious? He replied that the government is trying its best to find a solution.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Organizes Committee to Investigate Economic Enterprises</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] In order to cooperate with the national mobilization measures and promote the development of industry and commerce, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has organized the National Economic Survey Committee, with Technical Supervisor Tan Bohong as the chairman and Statistics Director Wu Zongfen as his deputy. The survey work is divided into two items: A general survey of economic enterprises, with all counties in the country as the survey object. The purpose is to obtain a general overview of economic enterprises in the country in a short period of time. The Ministry has separately sent letters to the Construction Bureaus of various provinces and the Social Bureaus of various cities to be handled by the county governments. A case-by-case survey of economic enterprises, with all major cities in the country as the survey object. Provinces with industrial and commercial guidance offices are responsible for surveying the economic conditions of the location of the office and the important cities in its jurisdiction. For major cities without industrial and commercial guidance offices, consultations are held with local government agencies and academic institutions to entrust them to handle the survey. The survey objects are divided into industrial editing, electrical enterprises, commerce, international trade, and special products.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Election and Recall Law</h3>
<p>The Interior Ministry plans to submit it to the Executive Yuan for review</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] News from the Ministry of Interior: The establishment of provincial and county councils and the election of provincial governors and county magistrates should begin after the implementation of constitutional government. Regarding the election of county magistrates, there was an earlier proposal within the Ministry to conduct trials in various counties. Now that the constitutional period is approaching, it seems unnecessary to conduct trials again. The Interior Ministry has drafted the draft law on the election and recall of county magistrates and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which can be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Interior Ministry is also drafting the remaining draft laws on provincial and county councils.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Madame Chiang returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by plane at 4:20 PM on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Mongolians in Beijing Suggest the Central Government: Please Determine the Border Stabilization Policy, Guarantee the League and Banner System to Resolve Disputes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Mongolians in Beijing, in order to deal with the current Mongolian issue, jointly submitted a suggestion to the highest authorities and various ministries and commissions. The signatories include Mongolian representatives to the National Assembly, Mongolian senators, Mongolian representatives stationed in Beijing from various leagues and banners, the Mongolian Association of Fellow Townsmen in Beijing, and the Mongolian Youth Federation. The suggestion pointed out that the reason for the chaos in the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia is nothing more than the central government's failure to establish a basic policy toward Inner Mongolia and the failure to clearly guarantee the league and banner system that the Mongolians have long maintained. In order to clarify right and wrong, relieve the suffering of the Mongolian people, and eliminate border disputes, the following four suggestions are made: Regarding the interpretation of autonomy, the government is requested to determine the basic method for Inner Mongolia as soon as possible based on the Constitution. The autonomy requested by the Mongolian compatriots is only to reduce the separation in the middle of the border provinces and strengthen the connection between the Mongolian people and the central government. Therefore, the focus is only on hoping that all leagues and banners can be directly under the central government, and the autonomy requested by the Mongolian compatriots has long been stipulated in the party's documents. It is only right and proper for the Mongolian compatriots to ask the central government to fulfill its promises and implement the Constitution. Regarding the interpretation of leagues and banners, banners are local administrative units at the county level, and leagues are local governments above the banner level. It is hoped that the central government will truly guarantee the league and banner system. The Mongolian leagues and banners are equivalent to the provinces and counties of the interior. Historically, the leagues and banners each have their own full administrative power and unique administrative system. In addition to obeying the orders of the central government, no other local political organs have the right to directly interfere. Some people on the border deny that the league is a local government above the banner level or only call it an election area. This is a deliberate distortion of the facts and prejudice. Please, our government, respect Mongolian history and establish a practical policy based on current laws and regulations, and firmly protect the league and banner system and rights. The reason for border instability stems from the discrimination suffered by the people of the leagues and banners. Please clarify the powers of leagues, banners, provinces, and counties, and abolish unnecessary county administrations to resolve disputes between Mongolians and Han Chinese. Since their establishment, the provinces along the border have been under a system where the military and administration are not separated, and the psychology of despising weak ethnic groups cannot but permeate all political styles. As for the counties in Mongolia, they were originally established to govern the Han Chinese in Mongolia and had no right to interfere in the administration of Mongolian banners. However, recently, each county has used the protection of the province to take advantage of its superior position to oppress Mongolian compatriots, causing the legal autonomous rights of Mongolian banners to be greatly infringed upon. In addition, in order to expand its power, the province disregards the factual needs and the lives of Mongolians, and forcibly adds county bureaus within each banner, increasing the burden on the people, and causing the Mongolian and Han compatriots in the banner to suffer. The reason why the Inner Mongolia issue exists today is that the conflict between leagues and banners and provinces and counties is the biggest factor. We dare to hope that the central government will make a decisive decision as soon as possible, delineate the boundaries and boundaries between leagues, banners, and provinces and counties, and abolish unnecessary county bureaus in the banners to reduce the burden on the people and prevent the recurrence of disputes. In order to strengthen the connection between the central government and Mongolia, the League Department and Special Banners must be directly under the central government. Article 5 of the Mongolian League and Banner Organization Law promulgated by the National Government stipulates that "all Mongolian leagues and special banners are subordinate to the Executive Yuan." However, today, some people in the border provinces say that the league's direct subordination to the central government has no basis, or should be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. This can be said to be deliberately obliterating history in order to satisfy their private desire to eliminate the leagues and banners. Moreover, border disputes are all due to political injustice. The provinces and counties oppress the leagues and banners, and the Mongolian compatriots demand autonomy in order to get rid of this shackle, directly under the central government, so as to preserve the survival of the nation. Please adopt the minimum requirements of the Mongolians, strengthen the organization of the League government, and ensure that it is still directly under the Executive Yuan, so as to enhance the connection between the central government and Inner Mongolia and consolidate the border.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Meet to Discuss Election Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties held Central Standing Committee meetings in Shanghai on the 28th to discuss election-related issues.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Shizeng, spokesperson for the Youth Party, issued a written statement on the 28th regarding the key points of the three-party consultation on election issues and the reasons for the postponement of the election of National Assembly representatives, as follows: "The nomination of candidates by political parties is a common practice in democratic countries. During this process of preparing for constitutional government in China, the methods for political party nomination have been clearly stipulated in the National Assembly Representative, Legislative Committee Member Election and Recall Law and its implementation regulations. Under the system of political party nomination, any personnel with party membership who wish to participate in the election must be formally nominated as candidates by the political party, otherwise they cannot participate in the election. In recent months, the key points of the consultations between the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Kuomintang regarding elections have been the question of how the candidates of the three parties should be nominated, so as to uphold the spirit of cooperation in jointly drafting the Constitution and jointly shoulder the responsibility of implementing the Constitution."</p>
<h3>The National Government Orders the Addition of Twenty Representatives from Chahar Province; Revision of the Electoral District Division Table for Legislative Committee Members in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The National Government recently issued an order: to revise the number of representatives allocated in the distribution table of National Assembly representatives elected from each county, city, and equivalent area. The table adds the number of representatives to be elected from Wanquan, Xuanhua, Chicheng, Longguan, Huailai, Yangyuan, Huaian, Yuxian, Zhuolu, Zhangbei, Shangdu, Kangbao, Guyuan, Duolun, Baochang, Xinming, Chongli, Shangyi, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou City in Chahar Province, totaling twenty.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The National Government recently announced: the revision of the electoral district division table for Legislative Committee members in Anhui Province. The second district in the table lists Wuhu, Xuancheng, Langxi, Guangde, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, Xiuning, Qimen, Yixian, Taiping, Jingde, Jingxian, Nanling, Fanchang, Shitai, Tongling, Qingyang, Guichi, Zhizhi, Dongliu, Dangtu, Jiang, Susong, Huaining, Taihu, Qianshan, and Wuyuan, 28 counties, with a total of six male Legislative Committee members, and the joint election office is located in Wuhu. The allocation table for Legislative Committee members in various provinces and cities that do not divide districts has also been revised. It is heard that Liaoning Province (population 11,284,380) should produce 13 Legislative Committee members, including one female and 12 male.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Meeting on the Japanese Peace Conference; Possibly to be Held in the US Soon; Foreign Minister Wang to Confer with Truman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Well-informed sources say that Foreign Minister Wang's work in Washington seems to be quite significant. The postponement of the release of the Wedemeyer investigation report is sufficient to prove that Mr. Wang will discuss the issue with President Truman. Mr. Wang will consult with Washington on the proper method for the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference based on China's position. The veto power issue will also be discussed. Before leaving the country, Mr. Wang had decided that we would propose a solution to this thorny issue at the UN seat. According to confirmed information, this proposal is to reasonably restrict the timing of the use of the veto power to avoid the continued abuse of the veto power to increase the difficulty of the United Nations' actions. In addition, Mr. Wang may take the opportunity to talk to President Truman about thoroughly resolving the knots between the US and the Soviet Union and other countries.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Well-informed sources say that a preliminary discussion meeting on the Japanese Peace Conference may be held here next month. During the United Nations General Assembly period, relevant countries may hold informal discussions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] According to Chinese officials here, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie will visit US President Truman and Acting Secretary of State Lovett, but does not intend to discuss the issue of US aid to China. However, he said: If the United States wants to discuss this issue, Mr. Wang will also be willing, but China has decided not to raise the matter first at this time, because it feels that there are currently no specific facts available for discussion. US officials believe that US senior officials still need a considerable period of time to digest and use the Wedemeyer report and begin discussing adjustments to their China policy. US officials also intend to use the opportunity of Foreign Minister Wang's visit to seek China's attitude towards holding a preliminary Japanese Profit Conference procedure.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] It is increasingly believed here that after negotiations between China and the United States, it will agree to the US proposal to convene an eleven-nation Japanese Peace Conference without veto power. It is learned that in order to obtain China's consent, the United States will have to publicly recommend a draft treaty and assure China that the treaty will stipulate that Japan's military, economic, and political affairs will be subject to control for at least 30 years.</p>
<h3>Resolving to Gradually Realize the Reorganization of Industry and Mines in North China; Sun Yueqi Goes to Zhangjiakou and Datong to Inspect Coal Mines</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 28th] Industry and mines in North China will gain new opportunities. After Premier Zhang Qun, accompanied by Mr. Sun Yueqi, inspected various industry and mines in Northeast and North China, he has gained a concrete concept of the construction of industry and mines in the North, which he believes is very important. Mr. Sun Yueqi, based on the results of this inspection of the various industry and mines, submitted to Premier Zhang the plan for reorganizing the industry and mines in North China. Mr. Zhang believed that they are all feasible and will seek to gradually realize them after returning to Nanjing. Mr. Sun Yueqi went to Beijing at noon on the 28th and is scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou on the 29th to inspect the Longyan Coal Mine, then转 to Datong to inspect the Datong Coal Mine, and return to Nanjing within ten days. It is learned that a batch of machinery for industry and mines in the North has been shipped from abroad to Shanghai and will soon be transported north for use.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Economic Affairs Re-drafts the Commercial Registration Law Draft</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 28th Dispatch] The Commercial Registration Law Draft,</p>
<p>was re-drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs because it believed that the implementation of the current Commercial Registration Law</p>
<p>was not entirely suitable for the current situation. It was</p>
<p>reviewed by the Ministers of Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, Finance, and Judicial Administration, as well as Political Committee Member Ju Zhen, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. Now,</p>
<p>it is learned that they all agreed that this new registration law draft is very</p>
<p>essential, and all expressed their approval. The key points and advantages of the new</p>
<p>law are summarized as follows: The new law combines the current Commercial</p>
<p>Registration Law and its Implementation Rules into one law, adding two chapters on Commercial Names and Businesses Operated by Foreigners.</p>
<p>The articles are quite appropriate and not excessive. Combining the law and the</p>
<p>implementation rules into one makes it easier for the people to understand and comply with, and the implementation is more convenient (as is the case with the new Company Law and Banking Law).</p>
<p>The new law does not adopt a listing method for the scope of commerce,</p>
<p>but instead, like the Company Law, uses a definition-based provision. For small-scale</p>
<p>businesses, the central competent department is given the discretion to approve it at any time, making it more flexible in practice. The new law changes the free registration principle</p>
<p>to a mandatory registration principle, so that the government can use the registration system to</p>
<p>manage commerce reasonably and promote its normal development.</p>
<p>The new law requires that registrations other than the establishment or alteration of a business, such as partnership registration, manager registration,</p>
<p>agent registration, registration of persons with limited capacity for action, and registration of agents, etc., should be</p>
<p>registered simultaneously at the time of establishment or alteration, to simplify the process. The new law adds a section on Commercial Names,</p>
<p>with clear provisions for the protection and exercise of exclusive rights to trade names,</p>
<p>and still adopts the usage principle in registration to conform to the facts.</p>
<p>The new law adds a chapter on Foreign Businesses,</p>
<p>hoping to use registration methods to properly manage foreign businesses, and to echo the chapter on Foreign Companies in the new Company Law, thereby aligning with the purpose of utilizing</p>
<p>foreign investment to develop post-war industries.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 28th Dispatch] The Commercial Registration Law Draft</p>
<p>was submitted to a provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan for discussion on the 27th. It was resolved to have the Ministry of Economic Affairs publish the draft, solicit opinions from public and private legal entities,</p>
<p>and then submit it to the Political Affairs Conference for revision. The key points of the draft are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter One, "General Provisions," consisting of eight articles, explains various</p>
<p>terms, defining a merchant as an enterprise engaged in business for profit,</p>
<p>excluding technical and specialized professions. Unless otherwise provided by law, commercial registration shall be governed by the provisions of this law. Small-scale businesses may not be subject to the provisions of this law.</p>
<p>The scope of small-scale businesses shall be determined by the central competent authority, taking into account the economic conditions within the provinces and directly administered municipalities, and shall be separately proposed and</p>
<p>approved by the Executive Yuan for promulgation. If the business operated by a commercial entity requires prior approval from the relevant professional competent authorities in accordance with laws and regulations, it shall</p>
<p>apply for registration in accordance with this law after obtaining the approval documents.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "Registered Items and Their Alteration and Cancellation,"</p>
<p>consisting of eleven articles, explains various procedures after registration, etc. Article 9 states that a business shall, within fifteen days of its establishment, report the following</p>

<p>total capital, name and address of the business owner or partners,</p>
<p>type and amount of contribution of each partner in a partnership,</p>
<p>whether the business owner or partners have persons with capacity for action or persons with limited capacity for action, the reasons therefor, the limitations on their business, and the name and address of their legal representative,</p>
<p>if a partnership has partners who execute business, their names, if there is a manager, their name, address, and limitations on their management authority,</p>
<p>if there is an agent, their name, address, and limitations on their agency, if there is a special seal for business use, the seal. If a partnership has been registered under the preceding paragraph, those who contribute or agree to contribute but are not registered as partners shall be deemed to be</p>
<p>nominal partners. Article 10 states that in the case of a branch office established by a business, the same items as above shall be reported for registration within fifteen days of establishment. Article 11</p>
<p>states that a person with limited capacity for action who, with the permission of their legal representative, independently operates a business, or is a partner, or a shareholder with unlimited liability, shall have their legal representative apply to the competent authority</p>
<p>of the city or county where the business is located for registration. If the legal representative discovers that the person with limited capacity for action is incompetent in the aforementioned act, and revokes their permission or increases their restrictions, they shall apply to the said authority</p>
<p>for registration of the reasons therefor. Article 13 explains that when there is an alteration or termination after registration, an application for alteration registration shall be made to the original registration authority within fifteen days of the alteration or termination. Also, if the registered business owner or partner</p>
<p>experiences situations such as inheritance, transfer, cessation of business, or dissolution, the alteration registration shall also be made within fifteen days.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, "Commercial Names," consisting of twelve articles, stipulates</p>
<p>the following as names that may not be used as commercial names: Names that are the same as the name of the Republic of China, the name or pseudonym of the Father of the Nation, the name of a government agency, or the name of a legal entity; The use of the words "China",</p>
<p>or something that is harmful to public order and morals or could deceive the public.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, "Businesses Operated by Foreigners," consisting of five articles, stipulates that in the case of a business operated by a foreigner whose head office is located</p>
<p>within China, if it is a sole proprietorship, the business owner shall have a residence within China; if it is a partnership, at least one of the partners shall have a residence within China. If the head office of a foreign business is not</p>
<p>located within China, but it establishes a branch office within China, and the business owner or partners all do not have a residence within China, they shall designate a person with a residence within China</p>
<p>as their agent for litigation and non-litigation matters. The aforementioned agent shall report their</p>
<p>name, nationality, and address and attach their letter of authorization when the branch office applies for establishment registration. This chapter also stipulates that it applies to businesses operated jointly by foreigners and Chinese in the following circumstances: If the contribution of foreign partners exceeds half of the total partnership capital, If the number of foreign partners exceeds the number of Chinese partners, If the Chinese partners do not have a residence within China.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, "Registration Procedures and Fees," consisting of twenty articles.</p>

<h3>Using Roman Letters to Spell National Phonetics; Replacing Chinese Characters for Sending Telegrams; Invention of Ying Changqi; Taiwan Bank Trial</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 28th Dispatch] "National Phonetic Telegram Dictionary" by Mr. Ying Changqi, which took eight months to write, has recently been published. This is the first work in our country that uses Roman letters to spell national phonetics to replace Chinese characters. Mr. Ying, as the manager of the business department of Taiwan Bank, has been studying philology for many years. His "National Phonetic Telegram Dictionary" first collected 4,000 commonly used Chinese characters and 11,000 commonly used words in the banking industry, and spelled them into Roman letter codebooks according to the national phonetics. On September 26, 1928, Cai Yuanpei, President of the University Council, issued and promulgated the "National Language Romanization System". September 26th of this year is the 19th anniversary of the promotion of phonetic Roman letters in our country. Taiwan Bank decided to start using Roman letter phonetic code to send and receive telegrams from the 26th, to commemorate this achievement.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Production This Year May Reach 11 Million Dan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently told reporters about the national cotton production situation this year: There are more than 39 million mu of cotton fields this year, and it is expected to produce 11 million dan of seed cotton. Judging from the current climate, this number should not have major discrepancies. Regarding the number of purchases that can be made this year, if we take the total production of 11 million dan, and subtract the estimated 6.5 million dan required for people's clothing and textile use, about 4.5 million dan can be purchased. However, cotton for clothing and hand-spinning is elastic and may decrease. If the cotton price is appropriate, purchases are vigorous, and cotton farmers are unwilling to store more cotton, then the purchase number may also increase to 6 million dan. Regarding the method of purchasing cotton, the current price is 2 million national currency per dan. Purchasing 4.5 million dan requires funds of 9 trillion to 12 trillion yuan. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believes that it is not necessary for government financial institutions to handle this, and it is best for each yarn factory and cotton firm to purchase freely.</p>

<h3>The Press Conference in Warsaw: Fifth Letter from Poland – Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>During my journey in Warsaw, what I admired and appreciated the most was the Polish International Publicity Department, or "Polish Publicity Department," which belongs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is equivalent to many "departments" in rank. The director, Grot, is a middle-aged man with a receding hairline who speaks fluent English and Russian effortlessly. Some say he is proficient in six languages; at the very least, I know his French is also excellent. People in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs call him "General." It is said that he once served in the military for a while, but he is essentially a man of letters. Since the restoration, he has been burdened with the most "important" work of the Polish government.</p>
<p>Grot holds three foreign press conferences every week, at twelve noon on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each meeting is a debate with sharp tongues and swords. I truly admire those British and American colleagues who have such sharp questions, but General Grot is always able to handle them with ease. I remember during one particular week in Warsaw, all three press conferences discussed the issue of American aid for European food. Marshall, in Washington, based on Harrison's report, said that Poland had more than enough food and did not need further American aid. At the press conference, Wan Luo protested strongly on behalf of the government, calling Harrison's report a "lie" and Marshall's decision "unfair."</p>
<p>He always speaks in English first, then translates himself into Russian. At foreign press conferences, English and Russian are considered official languages. Journalists from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union appreciate his Russian, while we feel his English is really beautiful. Due to differences in language and political background, the same round table is invisibly divided into two camps. What I find most interesting is the cigarettes on the table. Chinese, British, American, and French journalists all smoke American cigarettes, while journalists from Russia, Czechoslovakia, South [Yugoslavia], Finland, etc., all smoke Russian cigarettes.</p>
<p>The first time I attended a foreign press conference, many British and American journalists looked at me but did not speak to me. I remember very clearly that it was not until I took out a pack of "Marquis" cigarettes from my pocket and placed it on the table that an American female journalist leaned over and started talking to me.</p>
<p>However, General Wan Luo is able to deal with both sides very well. Firstly, his linguistic talent allows him to move easily between all parties. Secondly, he possesses rich knowledge and a quick mind. When protesting Harrison's report, he particularly emphasized that Poland's summer and autumn crops this year lacked seeds and provided many figures to support his claim. An American journalist said, "May I ask why the Polish government doesn't get seeds from Russia and always asks the United States?" The tone of the question was clearly humorous, what they call "digging" in Shanghai dialect, but Wan Luo remained calm. He said, "From Russia? We are currently negotiating in Moscow; whether it succeeds or not is another matter." He went on to say, "There are rich countries in the world and there are poor countries. Russia and the United States were both allies of Poland during the war. It would not be reasonable for us not to ask the United States but instead to ask Russia, which is preoccupied with its own problems. And as for the United States, it would be unfair to favor one ally over another!"</p>
<p>The second time the food issue was discussed, Grot invited a government official in charge of farming and import-export trade to report. The conclusion, of course, was still to criticize the United States for its "bias and unfairness." A journalist named Wheeler from the Chicago Daily News, who had just arrived from the United States, was so enraged that he stood up and said angrily, "During the war, the United States spent so much money and so many lives to liberate many European countries. After the war, the United States continues to spend tens of billions of dollars to help the Allies. May I ask what offense has Poland suffered to warrant such harsh criticism?" Grot smiled and told him, "You must have just come from the United States, sir. You didn't hear the first part. What you said is correct, but it's not the issue being discussed now. I'm sorry, please be quiet!"</p>
<p>Grot is a loyal Polish Communist, which his female secretary, Anna Krzysztof, told me when I hosted her for dinner. I stuck out my tongue, and she asked why. I said, "I am a professional journalist, and Grot is in the same line of work. From the perspective of my peers, I believe that a top-notch Polish talent like him should be above any partisan prejudice." I repeated, "I regret his joining the Communist Party."</p>
<p>Partisan bias can hinder the truthfulness of news reports. I remember at one meeting discussing the food issue, a British journalist asked, "May I ask if Poland has any intention of sending its food out the back door to another country and then requesting aid from the United States through the front door?" Grot replied, "No." Then, another American female journalist asked, "Can you guarantee that?" Grot hesitated for a moment and still said, "I guarantee with my conscience that there is absolutely no such thing!"</p>
<p>I plan to introduce the general situation of Polish industry and agriculture in future dispatches. Here, I should point out that the iron discipline of the Communist Party is clearly reflected in Poland. Several weeks before I arrived in Warsaw, when Marshall gave a speech at Harvard University about the European Economic Recovery Plan, the Polish government and public, especially most of the leftist newspapers, had loudly touted their "sincere support" and warm welcome. The day Molotov flew to Paris was almost the happiest day for the Polish intellectuals. There are two reasons to explain this: first, Poland's devastated situation meant they hoped to use the Marshall Plan to achieve economic reconstruction. Second, and more importantly, the Polish people hoped that the Marshall Plan could invisibly eliminate the division between Eastern and Western Europe and bridge the gap between the Soviet bloc and the British-American bloc.</p>
<p>However, Molotov's short trip to Paris shattered their dreams. Non-communist Polish intellectuals once again fell into the dark abyss, anxiously envisioning a bleak future and a difficult situation. The Communist left-wing newspapers made a 180-degree turn and criticized the Marshall Plan, using satirical and sharp headlines to say that Marshall was boldly fooling the European people.

<h3>Qingdao U.S. Military Incident: Sino-American Consultation to Remedy</h3>
<p>[Qingdao Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Major Ogg, the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps military police stationed in Qingdao, recently discussed several remedial measures with the Chinese authorities regarding the continuous incidents caused by the U.S. military: U.S. soldiers guarding will use shotguns, but may still shoot when necessary; however, shotguns are not lethal beyond four steps. For those who attempt to escape after causing traffic accidents, all U.S. military police patrol cars will now be equipped with wireless telephones for communication and command, which can quickly intercept the culprit drivers and severely punish them. To avoid U.S. soldiers mistakenly taking private cars for taxis and forcing rides, the two types of vehicles will now be marked with separate signs for clarification. The placing of "Out of Bounds" signs by the U.S. military in various bars, which infringes upon Chinese sovereignty, is something Major Ogg insists on; the matter is now being referred to Mayor Li and Commander Kirk for resolution. In the event of an incident, doctors from both China and the United States should be present for examination.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Refuting Stryker's Argument Against Reparations</h3>
<p>Mr. Stryker, advisor on reparations issues for the U.S. Department of the Army, recently published an article in "America Magazine" entitled "Retaliation is Waste," fundamentally opposing the United Nations' demands for reparations from Germany and Japan. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, he even advocated abandoning the Pauley mission's reparations plan and overturning the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions on this issue, so that Japan could retain a higher level of industry and embark on a path of self-sufficiency. When we saw Mr. Stryker's argument against reparations, we initially thought that this was merely Mr. Stryker's personal opinion and could not represent the attitude of the American diplomatic authorities towards the issue of Japanese reparations, and therefore did not deserve much attention. However, based on Mr. Stryker's brief biography, he has served as an advisor on reparations issues for the U.S. Department of the Army since November 1945, worked in Germany for a year, and then returned to the United States, where he served as chairman of the Special Committee on Japanese Reparations and represented the Department of the Army in investigating the situation in Japan. Now, he has published such a strange argument against reparations, which is indeed worthy of our attention. Moreover, this strange argument can be mutually confirmed with the delayed attitude of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo towards the issue of reparations. Especially in the United States, after an individual's views are published in newspapers and magazines, if they can gain the approval of the majority of the people, then they can influence American policy towards Japan. Therefore, Mr. Stryker's publication of the argument against reparations will have an adverse impact on the Allies' demands for reparations, which deserves the attention of our country's government and public.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly read Mr. Stryker's article published in "America Magazine" and summarized the main points as follows: The United States does not need the industrial equipment of Germany and Japan, so the United States not only does not want reparations from Germany and Japan, but should also encourage or help Germany and Japan to be self-sufficient. Only in this way can the United States stop its relief efforts. Regarding the issue of reparations from Germany, the opinions of Britain and the United States are relatively close, both advocating giving Germany a better opportunity to produce more food and more goods that can be exported. However, the Soviet Union demanded 10 billion U.S. dollars in reparations from Germany, and France also wanted to collect as much as possible from Germany, which were both opposed by the United States. The Pauley plan has been approved by the Far Eastern Commission, and the U.S. representative has also expressed agreement, but the United States should abandon or revise this plan. China and the Soviet Union can both exercise veto power within the Far Eastern Commission and will inevitably express objections to the United States' revision of the Pauley plan. In order to implement its demands, the United States has no choice but to set aside the Far Eastern Commission. Even if the eventual outcome is the United States making peace with Japan alone, it is worth doing.</p>
<p>If we stand in the narrow, selfish position of the American people to read Mr. Stryker's grand argument, we may also think that it is reasonable. But from our perspective, Mr. Stryker's fallacies, if adopted by the American authorities, will not only mislead people and have an adverse impact on other countries, but will also inevitably lead to the United States suffering the consequences and making a major diplomatic mistake.</p>
<p>First, during the occupation, the United States certainly spent a large number of U.S. dollars in Germany and Japan, which the American taxpayers had to bear. However, the purpose of occupying Germany and Japan was to control them, to disarm them militarily, to make them increasingly democratic politically, and to reduce their industrial level economically, thereby fundamentally eliminating their aggressive ideology and depriving them of their aggressive strength, so as not to launch another world war. Therefore, the burden on American taxpayers today can be said to be the price of permanent peace, and certainly not a waste. The meaning of reparations is not only to punish the defeated countries, but also to thoroughly destroy their war industries so that their aggressive train cannot start again. Reparations are not about retaliation, let alone waste. It is true that the United States does not need the industrial equipment of Germany and Japan, but this certainly cannot be used as a reason to oppose reparations, nor can it be used as a reason to prevent other victorious countries from dismantling German and Japanese factories, let alone encourage and help the defeated countries maintain their industrial level, so that their aggressive ambitions will not be rekindled one day.</p>
<p>Second, in recent years, the Allied Headquarters has consistently adopted a lenient attitude towards Japan. This newspaper has repeatedly written articles believing that leniency is sufficient to breed evil, and special vigilance should be raised regarding Japan's rapid recovery. Mr. Stryker's views are completely the same as what the Allied Headquarters has done. Therefore, we cannot help but suspect that some people in the United States today have gradually forgotten the painful lessons of the Pearl Harbor incident, and in the minds of these people, the enemy of the United States in the Far East is no longer Japan, and in Europe it is no longer Germany. The formation of this kind of thinking is really too dangerous! Not only is it enough to promote the division of the world at present, but it is also enough to lead to another war in the future. Judging from the diplomatic offensive that the United States has adopted at the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, it can be seen that the United States is moving along this road.</p>
<p>Third, the Far Eastern Commission was created in accordance with the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Declaration, and its sole task is to deal with the Japanese problem and draft a peace treaty with Japan. Because China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are the countries most closely related to the Far Eastern situation, they all have the special privilege of veto power. The existence of veto power is certainly sufficient to hinder the progress of the Far Eastern Commission, but for the sake of a fair and lasting peace in the Far East, the veto power should be retained, and at most it can only be restricted. The United States wants to set aside the Far Eastern Commission, and there is ultimately no legal basis for it in the process of drafting a peace treaty with Japan. Moreover, once the steps are disrupted, drafting a peace treaty with Japan will become more difficult.</p>
<p>Fourth, the idea of the United States making peace with Germany and Japan alone was first advocated by former President Hoover. Although American public opinion was interested in it, the American government did not pay much attention to it. Today, seeing Mr. Stryker's strange argument, he also advocates making peace alone, which shows that Hoover's advocacy has gradually become more common and powerful in the United States today. However, it must be known that peace is indivisible. If the United States truly wants to make peace with Japan alone, it is meaningless and will only cause international disputes.</p>
<p>In short, American policy towards Japan seems to need to be changed. We want to advise the American diplomatic authorities not to haggle over their own immediate interests, but to plan for the entire Far East.</p>

<h3>Political Reform and the Talent Problem (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Du Zuozhou</p>
<p>Naturally, it cannot be said that all true talents are abandoned or misplaced, without obtaining appropriate positions. But under the current severe economic situation and meager treatment, the income of a senior civil servant or university professor is almost less than that of a rickshaw puller. Those who remain steadfast and self-disciplined have no choice but to endure hunger and cold, and wait for death; while those with wavering wills, on the contrary, have many ways to gain both fame and fortune. Zeng Guofan, grieving over the politics of his time, once said with deep sorrow: "Everyone thinks that the lack of soldiers is not enough to be deeply worried about today, and the lack of salaries is not enough to weep bitterly over, but looking around this world, it is impossible to find someone who does not put personal gain first and fears being behind in rushing to righteousness, and who is filled with loneliness and indignation; or even if such a person is found, he is forced to live in a humble position until he is old, sick, frustrated, leaves, or dies, while those who are greedy and cowardly are promoted to the top, and become rich, famous, healthy, and immortal—is this something to be celebrated!" These words are no different from a portrayal of today's situation. How similar the societal distress and the mistreatment of talent are between then and now!</p>
<p>We want to shout out that to reform politics, we must first pay attention to the talent problem, that is, to pay attention to the way out for intellectuals in general. Intellectuals, appearing in Chinese history as scholar-officials, have a special status and influence, and the heirloom of successive rulers has been to rack their brains to win over and control intellectuals. In today's democratic era, those who hold power can no longer copy the control policies of the past, but if they are not even as good as the shallow techniques of treating scholar-officials in the past, then when will the source of national chaos be eliminated? It is a thought-provoking question.</p>
<p>Solving the talent problem naturally starts with education, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. The country has been running education for decades, and today we have such a serious talent problem. This is certainly not the fault of education itself, but rather than placing hope in the effects of the distant future, why not find ways to settle and properly arrange the talents that have already been cultivated? Moreover, solving the talent problem of this generation is tantamount to opening up a bright path for the talent cultivation of the next generation. Otherwise, if talents are wasted generation after generation, what can be imagined for the future of the country and the nation?</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the solution to the talent problem, which depends on the proper way to maintain talent, the author believes that the following points should be thoroughly implemented:</p>
<p>Loosen the restrictions on qualifications: We admit that qualifications such as diplomas and letters of appointment are standards for measuring talent, but overly emphasizing qualifications is like "judging people by appearance and losing sight of Ziyu," because "appearance" is formal, and qualifications are also formal. True talents do not necessarily have qualifications, and those with qualifications are not necessarily all talents. Strict civil service systems can only deal with ordinary talents and prevent the evils of speculation and good fortune, but for special and outstanding talents, they must be promoted exceptionally so that they can fully display their talents without being bound by the restrictions of qualifications.</p>
<p>Eliminate unworthy officials: "When owls are in the forest, phoenixes flee." If mediocrity is not removed, talent will not come. From ancient times, petty people and gentlemen cannot work together. Therefore, if the authorities have the determination to use new people and implement new policies, they must first eliminate the old and unworthy elements, and then new people can be introduced, and true talents will be happy to serve. Rectifying officialdom and cleaning up the bureaucracy is the first priority.</p>
<p>Open up more avenues for employing people: The state's formal way of recruiting talents is through examinations. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the examination system and listed it as one of the five powers, which was truly a brilliant insight. However, the past national college entrance examinations and various special examinations have only served as embellishments, a "spot of red in a sea of green," and have not been able to have an impact on the entire system. In the future, in order to open up more avenues for employing people and give talents the opportunity to "stand out," it is most appropriate to strengthen the implementation of the examination system. In addition, investigating unemployment, conducting talent registration, and providing job placement services are also very important.</p>
<p>Straighten out the discipline of elections: Elections are the first step into politics, and campaigning is an opportunity for talents to demonstrate themselves. How cautiously should this be held in the grand ceremony of opening the country. However, the current election discipline is too disappointing. Campaigning involves collusion and spending hundreds of millions at every turn; fights and disturbances are even recorded in the newspapers from time to time. This has simply become a competition of money and force, what does it have to do with talent! In order to protect the sanctity of politics, we cannot help but call out the slogan of "straightening out election discipline" to urge attention from all parties!</p>
<p>Increase the remuneration at all levels: This goes without saying. But like the standard for adjusting the remuneration of civil servants that the Executive Yuan passed this time, increasing the basic allowance by "100,000 yuan" per person, as the professors at Peking University said: "It's simply joking with us!" If we continue to "joke" like this, talents will either be gone or starve to death, how can this be!</p>
<p>In short, to reform politics, we must first pay attention to solving the talent problem. As the saying goes, "cadres determine everything," that is, talents determine everything. We hope that the government can be decisive in personnel renewal and truly show a refreshing appearance. This is really the key to whether our politics can be thoroughly reformed. Throughout history, politicians who have molded and shaped the talents of an era have certainly not been able to avoid lamenting the existence of "pearls buried in the sea," but their attitude of cherishing talent like life and treating the virtuous with courtesy can inspire the common people, and "all around will dare not disobey." Therefore, the principles of employing people and administering government are actually very simple. If they are understood with divine clarity, then all rivers will flow into the sea, and all the talents in the world will be used for one's own benefit; if they are acted against, then there will be collapse and overflow, and there will be no way to clean up the mess. The complexity of the talent problem is such!</p>
<p>Save the domestic talents who are in distress! "As long as the green hills remain, there is no fear of running out of firewood." Talents are the country's "green hills." We must cherish them and protect them. The future of national construction really depends on them. (The End)</p>

<h3>Promoting Korean Political Independence Should be Monitored by the United Nations; US Stance on Korean Issue is Clear; Likely to Largely Agree with Soviet Withdrawal Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 28th] US officials feel they have achieved some real progress in resolving the Korean issue. Sources with inside knowledge say the US is expected to issue a statement next week welcoming the Soviet proposal for the joint withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea. At the same time, the US will intensify its call for the UN General Assembly to consider the issue of Korean independence under a unified government. If the current plan can be thoroughly implemented, the US will indirectly point out that the Soviet proposal, in fact, accepts one of the seven points the US advocated on August 28th, which the Soviets then rejected. At that time, the US requested a four-power conference on Korea and stated its views on the purpose of this conference. The US requested immediate elections of legislative representatives in the US and Soviet occupation zones, the creation of a constitution for Korea under UN supervision, and the US hoped that the provisional government of Korea and related countries could agree on a date for the withdrawal of occupying forces from Korea. In addition, the US suggested in August that all steps of this plan be monitored by the United Nations and that allied nations jointly decide on the economic assistance Korea should receive. While accepting the Soviet withdrawal proposal, the US will insist that UN personnel be dispatched to supervise the withdrawal and election process to prevent conspiracies that might be launched by extreme reactionary elements in the US-occupied zone and communist cells in the Soviet-occupied zone. General opinion here is that the Soviet Union's sudden tacit approval of a portion of the US plan may accelerate agreement on Korean independence, but it may also deprive Korea of much of the economic assistance it could obtain from the US. The US intends to use the continuation of the US-Soviet stalemate to force Congress to agree to allocate long-term aid to Korea. If the Soviet Union suddenly agrees to withdraw and agrees to UN supervision of Korea, it is generally believed that interest here in economic assistance may decrease as a result. In any case, the US representative in the UN will seek ways to make the allied nations economically responsible for Korea and will point out the necessary construction while ensuring the maximum cooperation of the US to promote this matter.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 28th] It was learned today that the Soviet Union's recent proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet occupying forces from Korea next spring contained the phrase "believing that this withdrawal will give the Korean people the opportunity to organize their own government with the assistance of allied nations." After being translated by American experts, it was mistakenly interpreted as "will give the Korean people the opportunity to organize their own government without relying on the assistance of allied nations." This led to statements by Korean leaders such as Syngman Rhee, who believed that as a result, Korea would be in danger of civil war.</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky Discusses the Korean Issue; Advocates Consultation Among Three Powers; Opposes Submitting the Issue to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 27th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky issued a statement on the Korean issue at a press conference yesterday. The full text is as follows: He said that the Korean issue should be resolved through an agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. A reporter asked what the prospects were for resolving the Korean issue within the UN General Assembly. He replied that his view was optimistic, and he believed that if one wanted to resolve this issue, one needed to take a small step, which was to withdraw this issue from the UN agenda. The UN General Assembly, in any case, has no reason to discuss this issue; it should be resolved by an agreement among the three powers that have certain obligations regarding this issue, namely the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.</p>
<p>We are deeply aware that it is the United States' suggestion to abolish the negotiations of the US-Soviet Joint Commission and deny the need to immediately grant Korea independence. What I want to say on this matter is that the Soviet delegation, in its statement opposing the Korean issue being submitted to the UN General Assembly, stated that the best way to resolve this issue was to resolve it without the participation of the General Assembly. He also solemnly pointed out that the fact is that this issue is not within the capacity of the UN General Assembly and involves Article 11 of the Charter, which also involves the obligations and provisions of the agreement reached at the 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, which are truly needed to resolve the second paragraph of Article 37 regarding the Korean issue. I can also quote what was said by a United Press reporter and several other reports to implement the proposal of General Shtykov, the chief Soviet representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, which advocated that the US and Soviet occupying forces in Korea withdraw simultaneously from Korea in early 1948 and that the future issues be left to the Korean people to decide for themselves. All I can say is that we believe this is the best way to resolve this issue and the Korean issue. In order to help resolve this issue, we should remove it from the UN General Assembly agenda. Note by the reporter: Vyshinsky's statement did not mention China, which is deeply noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Truman Will Meet with Congressional Leaders Today to Discuss Emergency Measures to Aid Europe; Marshall Flew Back to Washington Last Night</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] New York, 28th broadcast: Truman will meet with congressional leaders tomorrow to discuss the most important issue since he became president, namely, the transitional and long-term nature of US aid to Europe. If the negotiations fail, Europe will be on the verge of disaster.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] US Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to fly to Washington tonight to hold a meeting with President Truman and congressional leaders on the 29th, and will return here that evening.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Democratic Senators Russell and McClellan said: President Truman may reach a gentleman's agreement with congressional leaders when he meets with them on Monday so that the President can use existing federal funds to solve Europe's immediate crisis without having to convene a special session of Congress. Russell et al. pointed out that the US Export-Import Bank, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and the Commodity Credit Corporation still have large amounts of floating capital. According to existing laws, the government cannot use these funds to aid foreign countries, but Truman can find a way to reach a temporary agreement with congressional leaders to temporarily use this money to meet Europe's urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito Severely Criticizes American Financial Groups</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 27th] Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, in his address to the opening of the Second Congress of the National Front Party of Yugoslavia yesterday, accused American financial groups of leading a revival movement of fascism based on greedy and aggressive imperialism. He also called on progressive elements everywhere in the world to struggle with all their might to prevent another horrific tragedy. Tito also said that international reactionaries, unable to annihilate the Soviet Union, are now attempting to prevent the establishment of truly democratic countries. They are borrowing the horrific ideas of fascism and rebuilding aggressive centers, including in Germany, as bases for imperialist expansion.</p>
<h3>American Round-the-World Aviator Arrives in Bangkok from Rangoon; Encountered a Storm Midway and Almost Perished</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Union Presents a Counterproposal on the Greek Issue to the UN General Assembly; Demands that Foreign Troops Withdraw from Greek Territory</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 27th] Soviet Representative Gromyko presented a new resolution to the UN General Assembly's Political Committee, accusing Greece of being fully responsible for all border incidents and demanding that foreign troops withdraw from Greece and that a special committee be established to supervise foreign aid to Greece. The resolution stated: The Greek authorities should bear full responsibility for the border incidents between Greece and Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania; The internal situation in Greece is the main reason for the border tensions; The current situation in Greece is largely due to foreign interference in Greece's internal affairs.</p>
<p>The resolution also called on the UN General Assembly to make the following recommendations: The Greek government should take measures to prevent border incidents; Greece should restore normal relations with its neighbors; Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania should conclude new border conventions and resolve the refugee problem; The Greek government should take measures to stop discrimination against Macedonian and Albanian citizens; Withdraw foreign troops stationed in Greece; Establish a UN special committee to supervise foreign aid to Greece. Gromyko's speech was 10,000 words long and mostly repeated old tunes, such as accusing Greece's "fascist" government of implementing a policy of terror against domestic democratic and progressive elements. He also accused the United States of openly interfering in Greece's internal affairs, inciting the flames of civil war. The United States even held elections for the Greek government and wanted to make Greece enter into a state of economic and political slavery. Gromyko also warned the United States, declaring that if a solution could not be found in the UN General Assembly, adopting collective security action would cause the collapse of the UN organization and undermine genuine cooperation between nations. He said that the US's advocacy of open military intervention in Greece is an extremely unfavorable and dangerous path for the UN organization.</p>

<h3>The British Conservative Party Strives to Make a Comeback; Churchill Condemns the Government and Launches a Major Attack on its Policy Towards the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Essex County, Snell's Brook, 27th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill addressed 5,000 Conservative Party members here, severely attacking the Soviet Union's aggression and conspiracies, and its abuse of the veto power. He said: The United States today is facing militarized communism backed by Soviet military power, all because the Soviet government has launched aggressive conspiracies in the countries bordering it and the Soviet government has abused its veto power to undermine the UN organization, which the people of the world place great hope in.</p>
<p>Churchill also severely condemned the Labour government, pointing out the sharp decline in Britain's international standing, the decline in the people's living standards, and the ever-worsening domestic economic and financial situation. Churchill also mentioned the "Soviet Iron Curtain" speech he delivered in Fulton, Missouri, in the United States two years ago, saying that although the American people were surprised when they heard it at the time, if he were to give this speech again in the United States today, Americans would regard it as a stale argument with no stimulation. Churchill praised Foreign Secretary Bevin highly, saying that Bevin's firm diplomatic policy was in sharp contrast to what his other cabinet members were doing domestically. Here, Churchill again made a scathing criticism of socialism. He also called on Conservative Party members to prepare for a sudden election at any time so that they could be elected to represent a new opportunity for national strength and wisdom.</p>
<h3>Churchill Comments on World Affairs</h3>
<p>When commenting on recent major events in the world, Churchill pointed out that the execution of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov was a judicial murder and a groundless murder, and said that the Soviet Union should bear the main responsibility for this matter. Churchill welcomed the government's decision to withdraw from Palestine, hoping that the withdrawal work could be carried out as quickly as possible. He pointed out that Britain was spending large sums of money and manpower in the Holy Land, and all it got was the resentment of the people there and around the world. He expressed his gratification that Britain was able to support the United States in maintaining the freedom and democracy of Europe and to provide food to famine-stricken countries. He also said that today he heard the cry of dollar panic for the first time, but it should be known that the dollar is the hard work of hundreds of millions of Americans, who voluntarily contribute, sometimes even without expecting repayment, to help the unfortunate people overseas. When talking about India, he said that the acts of slaughter there did not exceed his expectations, and this was just the beginning of an even worse situation in the future.</p>
<h3>Attlee Encourages Labour Party Members; The Opposition's Attacks are Detrimental and Useless</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Leicester, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech here to Labour Party members, urging them to maintain the adventurous spirit during the Labour movement's development and to remember the socialist mission that the Labour Party bears. Attlee pointed out that the results of local re-elections showed that even under the current economic situation, the people continue to support the Labour Party. Attlee also criticized the opposition party for promoting situations that are inconsistent with the facts abroad, which is detrimental and useless to Britain. The Prime Minister also pointed out that Britain's need to adopt restrictive measures is also partly due to the slow post-war recovery of other European countries. The problems encountered by Asian and European countries cannot be avoided by Eastern countries either. He felt that the Soviet newspapers' fierce attacks on other countries could show the difficulties experienced by the Soviet government.</p>
<h3>Protests Against Sugar Transport to Germany Erupt in France</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 28th broadcast: Riots broke out yesterday in the Verdun area of France. First, two barrels of sugar were intended to be transported to Germany, which aroused opposition from the local masses. The order was in great chaos for a time, so the police had to use tear gas.

<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 27th] According to authoritative sources today, the first telegram report of the Consular Corps currently in the Dutch East Indies has been sent here, stating that robberies in Java (especially robberies of overseas Chinese) are still continuing. According to reliable sources, the content of the report is quite worrying. Although the five consuls (including the Chinese Consul General) did not specify who was to blame, the report clearly stated that neither the Dutch nor the Indonesian side had fully complied with the Security Council's ceasefire order. The report also attributed the responsibility for the robbery of overseas Chinese property to individuals in the Republic of Indonesia. The consuls also frankly stated that they could not find any practical temporary measures that would enable the Dutch and Indonesian sides to more effectively comply with the ceasefire order. The one dispatched here last night was the first temporary report of the Consular Corps, and the detailed report is expected to arrive here next week.</p>

<h3>French Merchant Tram and Bus Services Did Not Resume Yesterday; British Merchant Tram Services Suddenly Went on Strike Again; Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Sternly Criticizes the Inaccuracy of the Cost of Living Index; Orders Resumption of Work or Consequential Action</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The labor strike of the French Merchant Water and Electricity Company's tram and bus workers has not been resolved. Some workers of the British Merchant Tram Company also entered a state of strike at 6:00 PM yesterday. All of the vehicles on Route 1, Route 2, Route 5, Route 3, Route 16, Route 14, Route 17, and Route 20 were successively driven into the depot and stopped around 7:00 PM. The routes of Route 8, Route 7, Route 10, and Route 11 still maintained service until the scheduled time. If the workers continue to be deadlocked, only the municipal Public Works Bureau's buses will serve the citizens today.</p>
<p>The French Merchant Electricity and Bus services remained suspended yesterday. More than 2,700 workers gathered in the union hall after the sit-down strike the day before yesterday afternoon, and only dispersed at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. At noon, the Social Affairs Bureau sent an official letter to the union, strictly ordering them to resume work on a specific date. The original letter stated: "It has been found that the chairman of the union, in order to demand bonus money and other issues, did not apply to this bureau according to law beforehand, and carried out a strike, which is incorrect. Now, at the time of the national general mobilization, workers must not strike or sit-down strike, and orders have been clearly issued. The union is to forward instructions to the striking workers to resume work on a specific date, in order to respect the law. If they dare to deliberately delay, it will be regarded as automatic resignation, and the company will be allowed to dismiss them unconditionally. The union bears the responsibility of leadership, and must earnestly guide them, and must not delay. This is extremely important, this order."</p>
<p>After receiving the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, the union announced to all workers that a temporary general meeting would be held at 4:00 PM to discuss the matter, but because not many people attended the meeting, there were no results. It was not until around 6:00 PM that the representatives of the ticket sales of Route 98 and the representatives of the line of Route 17 gave explanations to all the workers on behalf of the board of directors and supervisors, and decided to reconvene at 8:00 AM this morning to discuss the issue of resuming work.</p>
<p>[Da Gong News Agency] After the British Merchant Electricity and Bus workers went on strike, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said last night: This strike of the British Merchant trams is completely without reason. The union has always been unaware, and has not made any representations to the Social Affairs Bureau. Afterwards, a small number of workers stated that the reason for the strike was the inaccuracy of the cost of living index. The cost of living index investigated and compiled by the municipal authorities is absolutely accurate. Moreover, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, which represents all the workers in the city, also conducted an index investigation in the middle of this month, and the figures compiled were roughly the same as those statistically compiled by the municipal bureau. This shows that the reasons they hold are merely excuses. Even if the index is inaccurate, the workers should first appeal to the government. The sudden strike shows that someone is instigating it from behind. The government authorities, considering that most of the good workers are being instigated, have limited them to resume work and hope that the workers will no longer be exploited by others, and will resume work soon, otherwise, they will have to take resolute measures, and will never tolerate it.</p>
<p>According to Qiu Changjiang, chairman of the British Merchant Tram Industry Union, the union had no knowledge of the reason for the suspension of British Merchant tram services last night. It was purely an external force that oppressed some of the workers and exploited them. After the outfield workers drove the vehicles into the military factory, they went home separately, so it was impossible to persuade them. It is still unknown whether work can be resumed today.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Request the Selection and Appointment of Senators; City Council Sends Telegram to Central Authorities Urging Reconsideration</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last Friday (the 26th), during a State Council meeting,</p>
<p>a proposal was made by the Youth Party Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party to amend the regulations for city and county councils and provisional councils</p>
<p>to allow the central government to appoint representatives from various parties to participate in councils at all levels. The proposal has been passed and sent to the Legislative Yuan to be handled in accordance with the principles of the 12th article of the administrative policy. It is reported that the two speakers of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Pan and Xu, believe that any formal provincial, city, and county council generated by election should, in principle, not allow centrally appointed senators to participate midway, considering it a stain on democracy. Therefore, yesterday, in the name of the Municipal Council, they sent a telegram to the central government, requesting reconsideration, and also sent telegrams to all provincial and municipal councils, advocating for a unified stance. We are now transcribing their telegram to the</p>
<p>central authorities as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Jiang and Vice Chairman Sun of the Nanjing National Government,</p>
<p>President Sun and Vice President Wu of the Legislative Yuan, Premier Zhang and Vice Premier Wang of the Executive</p>
<p>Yuan, Your Excellencies: We have recently read in the newspapers of this city dated September 27th that the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party Committee proposed on September 26th to amend the regulations for provincial, city, and county councils, intending</p>
<p>to request, in accordance with the principles of the 12th article of the administrative policy, that the Legislative Yuan amend the regulations for provincial, city, and county councils and provisional councils, using a selection method to</p>
<p>select representatives from various parties to jointly participate in provincial, city, and county councils or provisional councils. As for the number of representatives, it is proposed to be 15 to 20 people for provinces or municipalities directly under the central government, and 5 to 10 people for counties or cities under provincial jurisdiction. This proposal has been passed by the State Council and sent to the Legislative Yuan to be handled according to the original</p>
<p>principles. We are astonished upon reading this. We feel compelled to express our concerns: The regulations for the provincial, city, and county councils in our country have long been promulgated and implemented. The original proposal, based on the 12th article of the administrative policy, requests amendments, which contradicts the principle that laws should not be retroactive.</p>
<p>The Number of Appointed Representatives Hinders Civil Rights</p>
<p>Moreover,</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>provincial, city, and county</p>
<p>senators</p>
<p>are legally</p>
<p>elected by</p>
<p>various provincial, city, and county regional and professional groups according to</p>
<p>population proportions. Once the number of appointed senators is added midway, it directly and indirectly hinders</p>
<p>the exercise of the four rights of the people, treating national laws</p>
<p>as worthless and undermining the government's credibility. In fact,</p>
<p>regardless of provincial, city, and county councils,</p>
<p>the existing senators, although not proportionally allocated among various parties</p>
<p>or social elites, are definitely not limited to any single party. Taking Shanghai as an example, the number of senators with Kuomintang membership is less than 40 percent. Although it has not been investigated whether the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participate, it is evident that the remaining 60 percent are social elites or members of other parties.</p>
<p>Members of Both Parties Can Freely Compete in Elections</p>
<p>If selecting</p>
<p>provincial and municipal</p>
<p>supervisory</p>
<p>committee members,</p>
<p>there is originally</p>
<p>no restriction on party affiliation, and there is no need for senators to be candidates. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party can continue to</p>
<p>compete freely through various methods, seemingly preventing</p>
<p>the issue of having no starting point. Moreover, the government implements</p>
<p>policies with the original intention of returning power to the people, not to</p>
<p>parties. Since the intention is to return power to the people, everything should</p>
<p>be based on the will of the people. Regarding the extension of the terms of the</p>
<p>senators, this is because provincial and municipal councils</p>
<p>will be established through legal elections.</p>
<p>It seems that members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party should strive to promote</p>
<p>this, so that local councils can be</p>
<p>formed. Members of various parties can also participate in elections as soon as possible, realizing the goal of participating in local councils.</p>
<p>Established Regulations Cannot Be Altered</p>
<p>As for the</p>
<p>established</p>
<p>regulations of</p>
<p>provincial, city, and</p>
<p>county councils,</p>
<p>they should absolutely not</p>
<p>be easily altered. This council believes that the State Council</p>
<p>should carefully consider this matter. Besides sending telegrams to the</p>
<p>Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the National Government, and sending notifications to all provincial, city, and county councils to advocate for a unified stance, we hereby state that the regulations of provincial, city, and county councils should not cater to the demands of</p>
<p>party factions and increase the number of appointed representatives,</p>
<p>which would confuse them with those elected, causing</p>
<p>the government to appear to arbitrarily legislate and destroy laws, and to prioritize parties over the people.</p>
<p>We respectfully submit these reasons in a telegram for your review and hope that you will adopt and implement them, as it is in the public interest. President Pan Gongzhan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Vice President Xu Ji,</p>
<p>respectfully submit this report.</p>

<h3>Puxi Water Pipe Installation Completed for Three Thousand Meters</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The installation of water pipes in the Puxi area</p>

<p>Wharf along Puxi Avenue, are three thousand meters in length and were completed on the fifteenth of this month. The total cost was approximately 400 million</p>
<p>yuan. Residents in the area who need water can apply for connection immediately. The bureau has decided to continue the water pipe installation project. The planned project is to extend the water pipes to the Yangjing area,</p>
<p>about three miles long. However, the difficulty is the funding issue, which is currently being planned by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Ordeal in the Barbaric Wilderness on the Border of Tuan Yan; Families of China National Aviation Corporation Crash Victims Recovered Nine Sets of Remains and Transported Them Back to Shanghai; Scattered and Incomplete Bones on the Slope</h3>
<p>On March 19th of last year,</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation Flight 13</p>
<p>9, flying from Chongqing to</p>
<p>Shanghai, crashed en route.</p>
<p>The fate of the passengers and crew, totaling thirty-</p>
<p>six people, was unknown.</p>
<p>It was not until this summer that it was discovered that the crashed plane was located in the Zhong Zi area of "Tuan Yan." A month ago, the China National Aviation Corporation sent representatives and family members of the victims</p>
<p>to the location on a special plane to search for remains. They transported all the remains back to this city on a special plane, temporarily storing them in the China Funeral Home to prepare for the aftermath.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter met Tao Chang, the representative of the families of the victims of the China National Aviation Corporation Flight 229, who provided the following account: This time, we and other representatives of the families of the China National Aviation Corporation Flight 229 crash victims went to Ebian County's Tuan Yan Mountain to search for remains. We departed from Shanghai on August 22nd, arrived in Chengdu on the 24th, and immediately contacted the provincial government authorities and relevant parties. Because entering the barbaric region was extremely difficult, it was necessary to complete negotiations. On September 4th, we set off for Ebian County.</p>
<p>At that time, western Sichuan was suffering from severe flooding, and the roads were destroyed. Military trucks could only reach Leshan. We then switched to rickshaws and walking, taking three days to reach Ebian County's</p>
<p>Shaping Town. Shaping is only 200 Chinese miles from the site of the Tuan Yan plane crash, but it requires passing through the "old forest," which is seldom visited.</p>
<p>There are many poisonous snakes and wild beasts,</p>
<p>and barbarians roam</p>
<p>the area, abducting people and selling them</p>
<p>as "slaves" to work. Therefore, Han Chinese have disappeared,</p>
<p>considering it a dreaded path. After we arrived at Shaping, we were</p>
<p>hosted by Mo Chengzhi, a local notable and current Sichuan provincial senator. His younger brother, Ge Chaolie,</p>
<p>planned everything for us. According to a report from a barbarian named Zhang Zhian last year, some passengers may still be alive,</p>
<p>having been abducted by barbarians. At that time, Ge placed an</p>
<p>announcement stating that if there were any survivors, he was willing</p>
<p>to offer a ransom for their release. Ge also sent someone to contact the chieftain of the barbarians, Mu Gan'er, explaining our</p>
<p>intentions to avoid misunderstandings. However, after a week,</p>
<p>there was no response. We then decided to bring guns and</p>
<p>venture forth,</p>
<p>led by Ge Chaowei</p>
<p>and a group of local people</p>
<p>and police officers, totaling sixty people. In addition to our family</p>
<p>representatives, there were also China National Aviation Corporation staff member Fan</p>
<p>Yuzhong, Mu Ye Company manager He Runzhi, and Ebian County police captain Xiao Qianxun,</p>
<p>carrying machine guns, submachine guns, rifles, and other weapons, totaling twenty-five</p>
<p>guns, in a group. In the "old forest,"</p>
<p>there were mostly cypress and fir trees, towering above the clouds, with bamboo lining the paths,</p>
<p>blocking out the sunlight. After traveling like this for three days, we</p>
<p>reached the border of Tuan Yan. As we approached the plane crash site, we suddenly saw several barbarians melting</p>
<p>the lead from the plane's wings. Seeing us, they shouted "</p>
<p>Chicken Pounced on the Ground," meaning that the barbarians wanted to tie people up,</p>
<p>and used</p>
<p>their barbarian knives to chop</p>
<p>at us fiercely. Another barbarian immediately</p>
<p>fired three shots, fortunately</p>
<p>missing. We immediately fired back and set up</p>
<p>the machine guns. Seeing that they were no match for us, the barbarians rolled</p>
<p>into the forest. At that time, a heavy fog filled the air, and they disappeared.</p>
<p>We then ordered people to guard the entrances while</p>
<p>rushing to the plane crash site to search for bodies</p>
<p>The plane crashed into a small rock on a flat dam,</p>
<p>and the bodies were scattered on the nearby slopes. Because it had been</p>
<p>so long, the bones were scattered and disorganized. We quickly collected them</p>
<p>at that time. Because we didn't know how many barbarians there were, fearing</p>
<p>that they would come again in force, we</p>
<p>quickly retreated</p>
<p>and rushed back to the</p>
<p>camp from the previous day to</p>
<p>ensure safety. The next day, we offered a generous reward,</p>
<p>gathering volunteers to search again. As a result, we only found</p>
<p>nine sets of remains, all incomplete. This was very different from the original</p>
<p>number of passengers. Because the time since the incident</p>
<p>was already a year and a half, the bodies were scattered and difficult</p>
<p>to collect.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Sabotage Power; Police Bureau Offers Reward for Fugitive</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau issued a public</p>
<p>notice yesterday stating: "After investigation, it was found that communist</p>
<p>subversives in this city were conspiring</p>
<p>to cause trouble, attempting to sabotage</p>
<p>power and create terror.</p>
<p>Previously, the Municipal Security Bureau seized important documents and arrested conspiracy offenders, including electrical worker</p>
<p>Wu Kewen and fourteen others. There are still fifteen fugitives, including Ouyang Zirun, who have not been captured.</p>
<p>It is reported that the police bureau has received a tip that the offenders not only do not regret their actions, but are also inciting</p>
<p>workers of the French Electric Tram Company and the British Electric Military Company to continue their strike in order to achieve their failed</p>
<p>objective. This is extremely illegal. We have ordered all subordinates to strictly arrest all the fugitives</p>
<p>and bring them to justice. A reward of ten million yuan will be offered for the arrest of Ouyang Zirun. For the arrest of the remaining fourteen people, including Li Yuanfu, Yang</p>
<p>Jinlong, Wang Yukun, Wan Shichang, Qian Shaohe, Li Zhensheng, Shen Xiangsheng, Wu Ze, Li Yi</p>
<p>tian, Ding Buyun, Yu Jiqing, Yang Yugen, Ni Renbao, and Liang Jinquan, each reward is five</p>
<p>million yuan. Half of the reward will be given to those who provide information leading to the arrest."</p>

<p>Buji presided over the prayer service. Shi Qincai, the company commander of the 9th Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment, Automotive Corps of the Joint Logistics Headquarters,</p>
<p>whose military vehicle caused the accident, sent a letter to the Wu family to express his deep condolences and apology, and also sent a representative.</p>
<h3>Celebration Turns to Tragedy; Collapse of Zhi Mei Lou Auditorium Injures Many</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhi Mei Lou Restaurant at 729 Hankou Road, across from the Yangzi Hotel, is owned by Yang De Tai. Recently, a large</p>
<p>building was newly built in the courtyard to serve as an auditorium for rent for weddings and funerals. Yesterday,</p>
<p>at 4:30 PM, his son, Bai Xin (18 years old), was holding his wedding ceremony with the bride, Jia Guimei (17 years old). The auditorium was packed with forty to fifty male and female guests when, with a loud crash, the newly built auditorium suddenly collapsed. The injured included the wedding host,</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Express Train Separates; Delay Caused by Accident, Fortunately No Injuries</h3>
<p>The 12th</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing night express sleeper train departed</p>
<p>from Shanghai for Nanjing</p>
<p>at 11:00 PM. Yesterday,</p>
<p>at 0:35 AM,</p>
<p>when passing Zhengyi Station, the "Tiger Hook" connecting the fifth and sixth carriages behind the locomotive</p>
<p>suddenly broke due to the vibration. At that time, the train separated into two sections. The first half of the train did not notice the accident and continued</p>
<p>to travel. Fortunately, the train conductor managed to signal and stop the train. After Zhengyi Station dispatched a rescue train</p>
<p>to tow it back to the station, repairs were completed at 6:45 AM, resulting in a delay</p>
<p>of more than two hours. The other trains, such as Train 16, were also delayed as a result. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<h3>Improving Agricultural Production and Increasing Exports to Overcome Current Economic Difficulties; Ge Jingzhong Speaks on "How China Can Achieve Economic Self-Reliance"</h3>
<p>Mr. Ge Jingzhong During his Broadcast (Photo by Our Newspaper)</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this newspaper held its 26th Sunday special broadcast at the Gospel Radio Station. Mr. Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of the China Silk Company, spoke on "How China Can Achieve Economic Self-Reliance." The main points of his speech are recorded below:</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese economy has encountered many difficult</p>
<p>problems. Not only are we ourselves anxious, but our allied countries</p>
<p>are also extremely concerned. This can be seen from Wedemeyer's</p>
<p>report. At this difficult</p>
<p>time, we are putting forward the slogan of "self-reliance." The</p>
<p>so-called "self-reliance" is not intended to be isolationist.</p>
<p>International relations are now very close. We need to import</p>
<p>materials that we lack from other countries, and other countries also need</p>
<p>to export materials that they lack from our country. An isolationist policy can no longer adapt to</p>
<p>the current situation.</p>
<p>Self-Reliance to Regulate Trade</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>when the exchange rate</p>
<p>is high, prices also rise. When the exchange rate is low,</p>
<p>prices also fall. Also, China is an agricultural country.</p>
<p>To build it into an industrial country, we must purchase foreign</p>
<p>machinery. Therefore, when we talk about self-reliance now, it is about how to regulate our foreign trade,</p>
<p>which is about how to adjust exports and imports.</p>
<p>In short, it is about how to expand and increase our country's</p>
<p>exports in order to exchange for foreign imports, so that they can</p>
<p>be balanced. China is an agricultural country, and 80-90% of its products are agricultural products. Therefore, most of our exports</p>
<p>are tea, silk, tung oil, and pig bristles. Before the "September 18th Incident," soybeans were the top export. In 1937,</p>
<p>China's exports and imports were not very different. Unfortunately, the war broke out and lasted for eight years.</p>
<p>Export Quality Must Be Excellent</p>
<p>After</p>
<p>victory, we</p>
<p>also encountered domestic unrest. Therefore, there has been a huge trade deficit recently. The most tragic month last year,</p>
<p>the trade deficit reached 90%, meaning that exports were only worth 10% and imports were worth</p>
<p>100%. According to the latest customs announcement, the trade deficit is approximately 45%. On the surface, it seems that the situation has improved, but in reality,</p>
<p>because the use of foreign exchange is restricted, many luxurious or excessively valuable</p>
<p>items have been temporarily stopped from being imported. Some may ask, "Can we reduce imports and</p>
<p>balance them with exports?" This is impossible. When it comes to construction, it is essential to import machinery.</p>
<p>When there is a disaster, it is essential to import rice from Southeast Asia and cotton from India. Since reducing imports is impossible, we can only</p>
<p>try our best to expand exports. This raises the issue of quality and quantity.</p>
<p>The quality of exports must be excellent and scientific. For example, the tea leaves from Taiwan,</p>
<p>after scientific roasting, are very popular when shipped to the United States and Canada. If the Chinese mainland</p>
<p>were to use scientific methods for roasting, would the export of tea leaves not increase significantly?</p>
<p>Purchasing Agricultural Products while Considering Costs</p>
<p>Expanding</p>
<p>foreign trade</p>
<p>by improving quality is a fundamental solution,</p>
<p>but it is too slow. To solve the urgent problem, the quantity</p>
<p>must be increased. There is a simple method for this.</p>
<p>That is, the prices of products purchased from farmers must take their costs into account. For each agricultural product,</p>
<p>the labor, fertilizer, capital, and interest involved in the production process must be accurately calculated.</p>
<p>If we purchase materials from farmers based on these costs, they will naturally be happy</p>
<p>to sell, and without encouraging them to increase production, they will naturally increase production. If the purchase price does not cover the cost,</p>
<p>and we force them to sell, then the farmers would rather cut down the tea trees and mulberry trees to burn as firewood than do business at a loss.</p>
<p>Not Incurring Foreign Debt for Construction</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>if the</p>
<p>government wants to increase production and expand foreign trade, it must conduct a detailed investigation into the costs</p>
<p>of agricultural products. This is the most appropriate method and also a method for increasing quantity.</p>
<p>When foreign trade expands, we can exchange our</p>
<p>agricultural products for foreign industrial products. This way,</p>
<p>we can carry out construction without incurring foreign debt. This</p>
<p>is the true meaning of economic self-reliance. To realize</p>
<p>this true meaning, we must find ways to improve</p>
<p>the quality and quantity of our agricultural products, increase exports, and</p>
<p>overcome the current economic difficulties.</p>

<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] After two emergency general meetings and three large-scale petitions by the city's dance industry, one dance hall manager said with a hint of loss, "Seeing the bright moon about to be full these past two days, our hearts are filled with indescribable sadness.  Every year, from Mid-Autumn Festival to Christmas, is a golden period for the dance industry; now, just when everyone should be joyfully welcoming the Mid-Autumn Festival, we are struggling to overcome a crisis of survival!"</p>
<p>These words are quite melancholic.  In the past month alone, they have abandoned the splendor and luxury they had painstakingly cultivated for over thirty years: neon lights dismantled, flower baskets disappeared, fragrant champagne no longer seen, and dazzling sterling silver utensils have begun to gather dust.  The dance floors are indeed "thrifty" now, but what about outside the dance floors?</p>
<p>Fashion stores have autumn outfits costing nearly ten million yuan, and restaurants have lavish banquets costing two million yuan per table.  Dance patrons and dancers, unable to enjoy themselves inside, naturally turn to these places as their ideal destinations.  Restaurants are full of sea cucumbers and shark fins, aged Shaoxing wine, and Huadiao wine. If they want to indulge in intoxication, they can still feast to their heart's content, even though these are expressly restricted under the banner of thrift.</p>
<p>The "thrift" in the dance halls has unexpectedly led to the prosperity of restaurants, but this is limited to only thirty-odd larger restaurants.  The more than seven hundred ordinary restaurants in the city are fearing the threat of "no tips allowed" brought about by the thrift campaign.  The waiters in the restaurants that sell set meals are not paid a salary. What happens when their source of income from tips is cut off, leading to labor disputes?</p>
<p>The restaurant industry, generally speaking, is not interested in the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is the same melancholy shared by mooncake merchants. Last year, they had pagoda mooncakes and battleship mooncakes, magnificent and beautiful, decorating Shanghai with the joyous scene of family reunions. But times have changed, and a "Cloud Dress Fairy Moon" mooncake priced at 500,000 yuan stands alone in the city. Onlookers cannot help but feel disappointed, and oldtimers naturally feel even more shabby. Thus, they order their staff to put on smiling faces and explain apologetically to those who stop to look: "It's because we are complying with the price restrictions!" Finally, they add, "Next year, we will definitely make a huge, beautiful one!"</p>
<p>Whether customers are "inspired" by this kind of sales pitch is unknown, but people are frantically buying mooncakes, five boxes, ten boxes, coconut filling, jujube paste filling, the "mooncake mountain" piled on the counter gradually shrinking. One housewife-like customer anxiously says, "Hurry! I need to deliver these gifts today, or I'll be considered disrespectful tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Presumably, those receiving gifts are not practicing gratitude or refusal because of thrift, so the price of ducks has risen from 8,000 yuan to 24,000 yuan per catty. Pork has also doubled in price, and vegetables, oil, sugar, and the seven necessities of life have all increased in price. Everyone refuses to bow their heads to "thrift." Are they really prepared to hold on to their belts to enjoy the moon? In reality, most people are struggling to make ends meet. Are they just going through the motions for the holiday? Nine out of ten people giving gifts will solemnly say, "Because it's thrifty now, otherwise the gifts would have been even more elaborate!"</p>
<p>Those who are truly anxious about the thrift movement are the bands that play music at weddings, funerals, and celebrations, as well as many newly emerging artisans who make flower baskets and wreaths. They are all worried about their fate after the Mid-Autumn Festival. They once said with great emotion, "In the Qing Dynasty, even a low-ranking official of the seventh rank supported many idle people: sedan chair carriers, heralds, gate openers, cannon firers... These were professions passed down through generations. Later, when these duties were abolished, their entire families fell into despair!" The speaker meant to compare this to his current situation, but one of the listeners interrupted, "Those people did not all commit suicide or starve to death after their jobs were abolished. I have personally seen many of their descendants change professions and become wealthy!"</p>
<p>Everyone is busily spending the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Mid-Autumn full moon will once again shine on these people – regardless of whether they are happy or sad!</p>

<h3>"Reader Scholarship Fund" Highest Individual Donation Record: Lu Shoulun Raises Funds, Yongyi Generously Donates 30 Million</h3>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>If you are not forgetful, you will surely remember the enthusiastic support of Mr. Yongyi Guangsheng for scholarships in the past. This was already five years ago, when our motherland was under the enemy's iron heel, and the people were suffering in deep waters and hot fires, groaning in agony. In order to uphold the justice of the nation and for the future fate of the motherland, the "Reader Scholarship Fund" burst forth with brilliant sparks at that time, illuminating the future for the hesitant youth in the boundless darkness of enemy rule.</p>
<p>"As long as the stone is there, the spark will not die out." Countless enthusiastic people participated in our scholarship work, contributing money if they had it, and strength if they had it, and Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] was one of them.</p>
<p>Although the motherland's war of resistance has been won, the war against the communists has begun, and countless young people are still earnestly hoping for relief. Therefore, countless enthusiastic people have once again started scholarship work.</p>
<p>This time, Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] generously donated 30 million yuan, adding a new force to the "Reader Scholarship Fund". In terms of individual donations, Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] has undoubtedly broken the highest record again. Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] is a hardworking entrepreneur, a longtime reader of the Shen Bao. His career is both beneficial to the country and the people, and his diligence, simplicity, and benevolence are especially commendable.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to extend our highest gratitude to Mr. Yongyi and Mr. Lu (Note: It was Mr. Lu Shoulun who raised the funds) on behalf of countless poor and struggling students. (Editor's note) The famous Shanghai painter and calligrapher Feng Chaoran has specially created a landscape painting for us, and designated that this painting should be given to the person who donates the most money, to show our admiration and commemoration. Now that the "Reader Scholarship Fund" is nearing its end, the facts show us that this valuable landscape painting will be respectfully presented to Mr. Yongyi [Guangsheng]. I think readers must be very familiar with Mr. Feng's works. He has a lofty position in the art world, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of our newspaper, will add a postscript to it, adding a lot of luster to this painting. We believe that it is indeed a very honorable thing for a philanthropist like Mr. [Yongyi Guangsheng] to own this valuable work.</p>

<h3>Fleas in Shandong</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] When the National Army was approaching Yingxi County, Shandong, a Wang couple in the city whispered while going to bed: "The Central Army is coming soon!" The next day, the couple was arrested. The bandit army tied their thumbs with ropes and hung them high in the treetops for interrogation: "Now let you see the Central Army!" Then they cut the ropes and shot them dead on the spot. This crime and punishment is called "Looking at the Central Army".</p>
<p>This matter was told to the reporter by He Zhihao, a battlefield inspector specially appointed by the Chairman of the National Government. He was dispatched to inspect the Shandong war zone and has been in the front line for two months. He told reporters that before the National Army captured Feicheng, the communist bandits convened a mass meeting to discuss a proposal to burn the entire village.</p>
<p>When the villagers raised their hands to vote, the chairman declared: "The Communist Party is democratic and wants to seek everyone's consent before doing something. Now we want to burn the houses. Does everyone agree?" The crowd was terrified and did not answer. The chairman said again: "The Communist Party is the most democratic. Burning houses must be approved by everyone's opinion!" The crowd was even more terrified, looking at each other in silence. At this time, the chairman turned red, stared, and shouted sternly: "The Communist Party is the most democratic. Burning houses is also for the benefit of the people. The people's affairs must be agreed to by the people, but the thoughts of older people are always backward. Let's see what the opinions of the new forces, the children, are!" So, the "Children's Team" raised their hands in favor, and it was passed as a majority. This is an example of the Communist Party's "democracy". If the ancient Greek philosophers who created the political theory of democracy knew that the Chinese Communist Party today practices "democracy" in this way, they would definitely laugh and cry!</p>
<p>"Dividing the houses" is a seductive slogan. The poor were delighted when they first heard it, but the communist bandits had a strange way of "equalizing wealth": the masses gathered in front of the mansion, and after a meeting and vote, the houses were immediately demolished. The target of the liquidation became a pile of rubble. The masses who struggled were divided into broken bricks and broken pillars. The communist bandits had completed another act of destruction. This kind of "equalization of wealth" has caused the tragedy of ten cities out of ten empty in many towns in Shandong.</p>
<p>What the people fear most is the communist bandit's census.</p>
<p>Before the census, the bandits sent spies into the houses in advance. At night, the census team fought outside and shouted, "Check the household registration!" If the family wanted to hide a strong man or hide some food, the bandit hiding in the house would see everything clearly, and the result would inevitably be severe punishment.</p>
<p>A certain division commander stationed in the Yimeng Mountain area said when entertaining the inspectors: "You have been bumping around on the front line, contacting only soldiers. Now I will give you a little adjustment and ask you to take a look at the women!" Sure enough, the guards were ordered to bring a woman. Everyone looked at her and almost vomited. It was a Russian old woman captured by the division from the bandit army.</p>
<p>She wore a Chinese cheongsam, covered in dirt, with no expression on her face. No matter how you questioned her, she didn't say a word. Old, ugly, and disgusting, she was like a witch in a Grimm's fairy tale. Searching her body for documents, it was known that she had been active in the Northeast. If she really couldn't speak Chinese, she must have had a translator working for the bandit army, and there must be more than just one Russian!</p>
<p>In the captured bandit army's battle order, there was a paragraph: "Fight with what gun you have, fight against what enemy, fight at what time and place." It seems that Chen Yi, that fellow, only specializes in fighting messy battles.</p>
<p>The National Army's Russian woman captured from the bandit army in the Yimeng Mountain area (sent by Shaochuan)</p>
<p>His main force has been looking for the weakness of the National Army, trying to harvest the effect of annihilation in mobile warfare, but the communist party's sugar-coated poison pill has been fed to the people of Shandong, and it has ruined its own political life. The people in the "liberated areas" don't want you! They are not afraid of you using the severe torture of "Looking at the Central Army". They still want the Central Army! The folk song "Down with Mao Zedong, everyone will have merit" hit the mark. Coupled with the advance of the loyal and brave National Army, dozens of dark "liberated area" towns and villages have been restored. Now, the remaining bandits in the border areas can only act as flea-like harassment, and it will not be difficult to clear them in the short term. (Special Correspondent Hang Shaochuan)</p>

<p>Peng Hengda and Zhang Shaoyun (also known as Zhang Shaoyun) are each sentenced to death for jointly robbing and intentionally killing, and are each deprived of public rights for life.</p>
<p>Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yishou, and Pu Pan Shi are all innocent.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>Liu Keming, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoyun were all members of the 29th Army Officer Training Corps. They retired successively between April and May of this year and stayed in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, where they organized a gang. Pu Yuzhou, carrying his family, resided in the home of Zou Wu Shi at No. 5 West Bank, Tongli Town, Wujiang County, making a living by selling drugs. He knew that the Chen family next door was relatively well-off, that her husband had passed away, and that her sons and nephews were doing business elsewhere. The Chen family consisted only of Chen and her daughter Zou Yue'e, and they were isolated and unable to resist. Pu Yuzhou then conspired with Liu, Peng, Zhang, and Zhou Tianquan, a member of the 17th Company of the 5th Battalion of the Training Corps, to carry out a robbery. They planned that on the afternoon of June 4th of this year, at about 4:00 PM, Liu Keming would go to the Zou residence, falsely claiming to be unable to find a house to rent, and deposit his luggage there, as a pretext for entering the house at night. The Chen mother and daughter were suspicious and asked their cousin Zou Bingcheng to stay with them that night. That night at around 9:00 PM, Liu Keming, Zhou Tianquan, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Peng Ming, Li Pengyun, Chen Lizhong, [blank] Jia, Hu Zhan [blank] Liao Bingming and others, carrying guns, went to carry out the plan, claiming to retrieve the luggage. The Zou residence fell into their trap and opened the gate. The bandits successively rushed in five people, Peng Hengda jumped over the wall into the inner room.  The gang immediately forced Zou Bingcheng to call out to open the second door, and Pu Hengda and Tong Tianquan and others bound Chen's daughter and Zou Bingcheng and his wife together. Because Zou Yue'e shouted for help, Liu used a yardstick to push cotton into her mouth, and then raped her, causing Yue'e to suffocate and die. The [blank] and others robbed the Chen family of seven gold rings and one gold bracelet, and Zou Bingcheng of one gold ring, before fleeing. Zou Chen reported the incident to the Wujiang District Prosecutor's Office, which verified that Zou Yue'e had been raped before death and suffocated, as recorded in the files. The 29th Army Officer Training Corps, upon receiving the report, together with the mayor of Tongli Town, arrested Tong Tianquan, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Liu Keming, and suspects Pu Pan Shi, Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yi [blank] and others and escorted them to the case.</p>
<p>The Five Executed Criminals: Liu Keming, Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Zhou Tianquan.</p>
<p>The reasons for this case are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Liu Keming, Pu Yuzhou, Zhou Tianquan, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoyun: Although the defendants were cunning and did not confess to the facts listed on the right, the files show that Zhou Tianquan confessed in the Officer Training Corps: "That day it was almost dark, I ran into Liu Keming on the bridge, and then I met Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, Zhang Shaoyun, Peng Ming, etc. We went to the Zou family together. Liu Keming called the door, and an old grandmother opened the door. Everyone went in. We ran into the old lady, Liu Keming looked for Zou Yue'e, first he argued with her, and then he punched her. She ran away, and Liu also followed her in. Peng Hengda and Liu Keming tied her up. Pu Yuzhou and Zhang Shaoyun stood at the door, and the rest stood in the courtyard. Liu Keming held her down (referring to the deceased) and used a ruler to shove cotton in her mouth" (see Officer Training Corps file, June 11th record). Liu Keming confessed: "On June 3rd, at Pu Yuzhou's house, Pu said that the Zou family didn't have many people, and they had a lot of gold and cash. We could go and do a job and make some money. On the morning of the 4th, we planned to do it at night. We gathered at the entrance of Pu's house. Two people from Tongli each brought guns. Li Pengju, Fan Qikui, and Ran Qixi and I also brought guns. There was probably a lock set inside" (see Officer Training Corps investigation file, June 12th record). Pu Yuzhou confessed: "Liu Keming brought the quilt in. He used the excuse of putting the quilt down so that he could go at night. Liu Keming and Zhang Shaoyun were the ones who kicked the door open and went in. They told me that they were going to rob the Zou family tonight. I replied that they shouldn't hurt anyone. They told me to look at the back door. Zou Yue'e shouted loudly, and Liu Keming stuffed her mouth with cotton," etc. (see Officer Training Corps file, June 12th record). Questioning the plaintiff, Zou Chen Shi, she stated: "They first tied my daughter in the room for half an hour. One of them came out, wiping his sweat, it looked like him (referring to Liu Keming), the one who brought the bedding during the day, and the one who came over from Pu's side door first, it was also him. This person (referring to Zhou Tianquan) tied me up and asked me for money and gold." Zou Shen Shi, the deceased Zou Yue'e's sister-in-law, stated: "That day at two o'clock, [blank] from the Pu family came over, I opened the door, the one who entered the [blank] house was him" (referring to Liu Keming) (see Wujiang District Court file, page 69). Jin Shan Quan (also known as Jin Xiaosu, the deceased's nephew) stated: "That night he (referring to Zhou Tianquan) tied up my grandmother and stuffed cotton in her mouth, that's absolutely correct." Further investigation of Pu Yuzhou's drug dealing, Zou Wu Shi (Pu's landlord) stated: "Many people came and went to Pu's house. At night, I smelled a scent, a white powder scent (i.e., heroin). [Blank] three often came and went. I had eaten it for a few days when I was thirty years old, so I smelled the white powder" (see court file, page 63). Peng Hengda confessed: "Someone surnamed Ran said that he had white flour to buy at his house. Liu Keming confessed: "The one who runs the white flour business in Tongli Hall told me that his family sells white flour" (see record of joint trial by this Ministry). Although Peng Hengda vehemently denied being involved in the robbery and claimed that he had already returned home that night and had not gone out, and that the landlord opened the door, which could serve as proof to the contrary, Peng's landlord Xue Shen Shi stated: "Peng went out after dark that night and didn't come back until 11:00." Moreover, Zou Bingcheng pointed out: "There are two Zhang Shaoyuns there, I am numbers three, four, and five, living at number 22, Jincheng Hotel, Suzhou, and numbers 6, staying at the garrison of the 145th Division in Laolumen" (see the original file of the town office), and also called the orderly Tian Yun at the garrison (see file [blank] page 28). After detailed verification of the Jincheng Hotel's log, there was no registration of Zhang Shaoyun staying there, and the garrison of the 145th Division had no person named Tian Yun (see Wujiang County Government telegram of August 19). Zhang Yixun stated: "The Zhang Shaoyun who lives in Zhenze is very old, and I watched a play with him at the Zhenze Theater on the evening of June 4th." Pu Yuzhou stated: "This Zhang Shaoyun was definitely captured" (see court file, page 38), etc. The evidence to the contrary presented by Peng Hengda and Zhang Shaoyun is insufficient to prove their claims. Furthermore, they have been clearly identified by the victims and accomplices, so their empty words of sophistry and denial of responsibility cannot be accepted. After reviewing the entire file, the defendants either confessed frankly, or were clearly identified by the victims, and the evidence corroborates each other. They are all principals in the commission of the crime, and there is no doubt about it. Considering their actions, Zhou Tianquan is a soldier and should be convicted of colluding to rob. The deceased Zou Yue'e was verified to have been raped, and it was Liu Keming who dragged her to the ground in the hall, and left only after half an hour. It is extremely clear that Liu is the principal offender in the rape, and he should be convicted of both robbery resulting in intentional homicide and robbery resulting in rape. However, because these acts arose from a single act of robbery, the more serious charge of jointly robbing and intentionally killing should be applied. Pu Yuzhou, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoyun should be convicted of jointly robbing and intentionally killing. Furthermore, Pu Yuzhou sold drugs, which has been corroborated by multiple testimonies and is therefore reliable. He should be convicted of selling drugs. These charges should be considered separately and punished concurrently with the charge of jointly robbing and intentionally killing, as the intent of each crime is different.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yishou, and Pu Pan Shi: After repeated investigations of Liu Guozhang, Liu Jun, Zhang Yishou, and Pu Pan Shi, they have all vehemently denied participating in the robbery. Neither the victims nor the principals Liu Keming, Zhou Tianquan, and Pu Yuzhou have implicated them as accomplices. It should be considered that the evidence of their guilt is insufficient to prove their involvement in the crime, and they should all be found not guilty.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 2, Item 5 of the Provisional Emergency Military and Political Measures for the Pacification Zone and the Nine Northeastern Provinces, Article 1, Article 2, the first paragraph of Article 8 of the Wartime Army, Navy, and Air Force Summary Trial Regulations, Article 291 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the first paragraph of Article 293, Article 84, Article 15 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, Article 2, Item 1, Clause 6 and Clause 8, Article 9 and Article 51, Clause 1 and Clause 8, Article 37, Clause 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, judgment is rendered as stated in the main text. August, 1936 of the Republic of China. Joint deliberation and judgment by Presiding Judge Zhang [blank] Sheng, Judge Liu Mengjiu, and Du Mulu.</p>

<h3>Opinions on Hu Shih's Ten-Year Education Plan by Cheng Hsiaogang</h3>
<p>Each school has its own unique strengths. The dentistry of West China University and the agriculture of Nanking University are strengths not possessed by Peking University and the other four. In developing academic pursuits, one should focus on these special departments and assist their development, so that they can achieve first-class international academic status.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Cheng Hsiaogang, the new president of Jiaotong University, arrived in Shanghai the other day and stayed at the Yangzi Telegraph Office Guesthouse. He is scheduled to take office at the university this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng, in response to questions from reporters at the guesthouse yesterday, stated the following: Since the end of the war, the number of faculty and students at Jiaotong University has increased dramatically. The existing facilities have been unable to keep up with the current needs, which has had a significant impact on teaching and learning. Everyone shares this sentiment. This individual is now in charge of the university administration and is eager to gain cooperation and assistance from all sides in developing the university's affairs in the future, focusing on concrete actions. It is futile to engage in empty talk at this time without immediate results. However, I can say that both myself and others connected to Jiaotong University hope to restore the university's previous high academic standards in the short term, enhance the students' desire for learning. The Ministry of Education has already increased the number of professors by more than a hundred this semester. The equipment donated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will also be very helpful for teaching experiments. In terms of funding, in addition to the Ministry of Education, we have also approached various parties for donations, hoping to improve the welfare of faculty and students as much as possible. As for the various matters already decided by the Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee, Mr. Cheng stated that he would not make any changes. Mr. Cheng then expressed his opinion on the ten-year education plan of Hu Shih, the president of Peking University, saying that universities include a wide range of departments, and each school has its own unique strengths. The dentistry of West China University and the agriculture of Nanking University are strengths not possessed by Peking University and the other four. In developing academic pursuits, one should focus on these special departments and assist their development, so that they can achieve first-class international academic status, and one name cannot replace its position. He believes that the division of labor in science is becoming increasingly detailed and beneficial. In agricultural studies, there is the field of botany, and within botany, there are the departments of plant diseases and entomology. For example, the cotton produced in Dali, Yunnan, is of very good quality, growing taller than a person, but it is often damaged by pests and diseases, preventing large-scale production. In other areas, the losses caused by pests and diseases to our country's annual cotton, wheat, and rice production are countless, yet no one pays attention to researching prevention and control measures, which is very regrettable. Speaking of engineering, the division of labor is also detailed, and the achievements of various schools vary. The government should develop them separately based on the strengths of each school. Mr. Cheng hopes to replace Hu Shih's ten-year education plan with this idea. He pointed out: This can build on the existing foundation of each school, making it easier for greater development and allowing universities to compete with each other. It can also equalize funding and avoid regional disputes.</p>

<h3>Group A Volleyball League: Yongsha Wins the Championship; Huayan Loses After a Five-Set Battle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the GuoZhen Cup, the Yongsha volleyball team has won the Group A championship in the second Volleyball League. They achieved six wins in six matches. In last night's final, they once again defeated Huayan in a dramatic five-set battle. After falling behind 1-2, Yongsha quickly rallied, winning two consecutive sets to come from behind and secure a 3-2 victory, which is highly gratifying. Huayan initially impressed, winning the first set and then taking a 2-1 lead. Unfortunately, in the extremely tense situation of the fourth set, when the score was tied at 19-19, they failed to seize the victory and allowed Yongsha to score two points, leading to a 21-19 score and a 2-2 tie, resulting in a decisive fifth set, which was a pity for Huayan. During the decisive fifth set, the atmosphere was tense. At first, the score was tied at 7-7 and 8-8, but Yongsha then pulled ahead with an 11-8 lead. As the score reached 17-11, Yongsha seemed destined to win. Huayan's ZhiJi served and scored four consecutive points, bringing the score to 17-15 and increasing the tension. Then, the score reached 19-17. Just when it seemed that Huayan could not rally, Yongsha scored two consecutive points to complete the victory. Last night, neither Yongsha nor Huayan showed any particularly outstanding performance, nor did Huayan seem destined to lose. The difference was slight.</p>
<p>The sporting ability last night was suddenly apparent, with about six or seven hundred people coming to watch the final. In the women's group, Fuhua defeated Jinde, and in the two Group B matches, Shangyu Huaqing won.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Mini-Ball: Donghua and Lehua Advance; Jingwu and Hequn Eliminated</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Cup mini-ball tournament held its second act yesterday, starting at 3:00 p.m. in Jin Yuan Park. Lehua and Donghua successively eliminated Jingwu and Hequn with scores of 1-0.

<h3>Tao Guanyu and McLagan Fail to Determine a Winner in the Semifinals; Mrs. Ye Guanziong Gains Right to the Women's Singles Final</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the second day of the open tennis championship semi-finals. Due to the exciting and intense program and the cooler weather, the crowd at the Shanghai Tennis Club on Wuyuan Road reached over 800 people, which is unprecedented for a tennis match. It started at 2:00 p.m. In the senior singles semi-finals, the continuation of the fifth set between Wang Wenzheng and Zhou Guanjun saw Zhou Guanjun take a 3-1 lead. Unexpectedly, he lost five consecutive games, and Wang Wenzheng won with a score of 6-3, eliminating Zhou Guanjun with a total score of 3-2 and gaining a spot in the finals. Zhou Guanjun's loss was a great pity. In another match, Tao Guanyu vs. McLagan, unexpectedly, the two players fought to a 2-2 tie, failing to determine a winner. Due to the darkening sky, they agreed to continue the match at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, with the previous scores nullified. This is a match worthy of attention. In the women's singles semi-finals, Mrs. Ying Guanziong eliminated the Western player Miss Green with a score of 2-0. In the intermediate singles, Sun Yifang defeated Jia Zhen with a score of 2-1 to gain a spot in the finals. Little Gu had more experience, but Sun Yifang came from behind to win.</p>
<p>Intermediate Singles Match</p>
<p>Women's Singles Semi-Finals</p>
<p>In the women's group, Mrs. Ye, Ms. Yang WeiBin, and Miss Pan LuFu competed fiercely. Pan won three consecutive games in one breath, causing the entire audience to lose hope. Fortunately, Yang regained her form later and won the first set 6-4. In the second set, Pan's resistance was weak, and Yang won again with a score of 6-3. Yang advanced to the final week with a straight two sets and will compete with Zhu Zhiying for the title of women's group champion.</p>
<p>McLagan Battle</p>
<p>In another men's senior singles semi-final, Tao Guanyu battled McLagan. Tao relied on his skilled technique and easily won the first set 6-2. However, McLagan refused to show weakness, and in the second set, he frequently scored with forehand shots, causing Tao to struggle. McLagan then won the set 6-4. In the third set, McLagan lost momentum again, and Tao easily won 6-2. Everyone thought Tao would win in one go, but unexpectedly, at 4-4, McLagan scored two consecutive games and won the set 6-4, resulting in a 2-2 tie. Due to the darkening sky, both sides agreed to nullify the previous scores and replay the match at the original venue at 3:30 p.m. this Thursday.</p>
<p>Today's Doubles</p>
<p>Today is the third</p>
<p>day of the semi-finals, starting at</p>
<p>3:30 p.m. The first group is the preliminary singles match between Gu Jiazhen and Chen Cuixiang. Gu had reached the semi-finals in the intermediate group but unfortunately lost to Sun Yifang yesterday. He has high hopes for this preliminary championship.</p>
<p>The second match is the semi-final doubles match between Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanyu vs. Cai Guochun and Liang Saikui. Tao's group is the hegemon of Shanghai, while Cai and Liang's group is a rising star. They defeated Peng Nabivich and McLagan in the semi-finals, so there should be a fierce battle. Tickets are changed to one or two ten thousand yuan and are not numbered. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Gu Jiazhen vs. Chen Cuixiang (Preliminary) 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Tao Guanyu Cai Guoheng</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Liang BaoKui</p>
<p>(Doubles) 4:30 p.m.</p>

<h3>Textile Adjustment Committee Will Cooperate with Municipal Authorities to Crack Down on Yarn and Cloth Hoarding and Speculation, Starting with Inventory Checks and Registration</h3>
<p>According to a statement by the person in charge of the Textile Adjustment Committee: The implementation plan for adjusting the supply and demand of yarn and cloth has been announced and implemented. In order to stabilize yarn prices, the committee has decided to severely crack down on hoarding and speculation of yarn and cloth based on this plan. The primary task is to conduct inventory checks of yarn and cloth on the market together with the municipal authorities, starting today. According to regulations, the amount of cotton yarn stored by each factory should be sufficient for three months of use by the factory. Yarn number storage shall not exceed forty-five days. Cloth merchants shall not store more than twice the amount of cloth they sell in their peak months. Overdue and excessive amounts will be seized and prosecuted as hoarding and speculation. The government will then purchase them at negotiated prices to suppress their illegal profits. Regarding the crackdown on speculative transactions in yarn and cloth, the Textile Adjustment Committee will dispatch personnel at any time together with the municipal government to secretly investigate the cotton yarn and cloth market. If any acts of monopoly, speculative buying and selling, or short selling are discovered, they will be reported and punished. The registration of cotton yarn and cloth inventory, the registration of cotton yarn and cloth businesses, and the registration of cotton yarn reproduction industries will be carried out separately.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Negotiated Pricing Method Extended to Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou</h3>
<p>In order to suppress cotton yarn prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee will extend the cotton yarn negotiated pricing method to Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The committee will set up branches in the above three cities to handle matters according to Shanghai standards. For those transported via the Beijing-Shanghai route, transportation costs and profits will be added. If local producers are involved, prices will be negotiated with reference to local production costs and market conditions, and reported to the committee for record. This will be implemented in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Black Market Cannot Be Eliminated, Overseas Remittances Cannot Enter the Right Track</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Relevant sources stated: The total amount of overseas remittances in July was over US$190,000. The statistics for August have not yet been compiled, but it is estimated that there will not be a significant increase or decrease. This figure is higher than before foreign exchange was listed, but it has not reached the expected hope. The key lies in the failure of the black market and the official exchange rate to align. Especially in areas close to our country, such as the Philippines and Southeast Asia, they are particularly sensitive to the difference between the black market and the official exchange rate. At the same time, the inflow of overseas remittances into the black market has become a habit, and it will not be possible to reverse this situation in a day. According to experts' estimates, before the war, 70% of our country's overseas remittances came from Southeast Asia and 30% from the United States and the United Kingdom. During the Pacific War, the entire territory of Southeast Asia fell, but our country's monthly overseas remittance income was still around US$10 million. If overseas remittances can be brought into the right track, the monthly amount could reach over US$40 million.</p>
<h3>US Short-Term Treasury Bills Will Be Exchanged for Bonds Starting Today</h3>
<p>Since their issuance, all of the sold US dollar short-term treasury bills have been subscription vouchers. It is now learned that the official treasury bills have been fully printed by the Ministry of Finance and have been fully allocated to the National Bank Treasury Bureau. The exchange will begin today. Those who have subscribed for treasury bill subscription vouchers can go directly to the original sales agency to exchange them.</p>
<h3>Silk Association Reports on Autumn Cocoon Purchasing Situation</h3>

<p>1.  The China Farmers Bank requested the formulation of a method for manufacturers to repay the balance of autumn loans. This was submitted for discussion.</p>
<h3>XinGuang Underwear Completes Capital Increase; New Shares Will Be Listed Tomorrow</h3>

The yarn spindles and weaving machines ordered from abroad will also arrive in Shanghai one after another. The students of the training institute graduate four times a year, with more than a hundred students in each session. The original factory buildings are also insufficient for distribution. If 20,000 spindles are all brought in, a giant factory building will be built again to accommodate them.</p>
<p>The company's international trade manager, Mao XiaoJun, has just returned to Shanghai from Bianluo. According to him, the domestic cotton textile factory managers in the Southeast Asian market are receiving many visitors every day. Australia and New Zealand have a severe shortage of cotton textiles, and "XinGuang Standard" brand shirts will soon be exported in large quantities.</p>
<p>It was resolved: Please ask the design committee to hold a meeting next Monday to research and discuss the matter before submitting it to the meeting.</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the issue of calculating the interest date for the 36th year's spring fresh cocoon loans, it was resolved: The interest date for the spring period fresh cocoons will be calculated based on 50 days.</p>

<p>and not falling. Finally, Huangxiangmao soap rose by 9,000</p>
<p>yuan, Guben rose by 5,000 yuan, JianDao rose by 15,000</p>
<p>yuan, and Guanghua, Yinghua, etc. each rose by about 10,000</p>

<h3>Knitting and Talent Selection</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Qiu Ping and the knitting school have been around for a decade. Over the years, we have taught over a thousand students. Here, I will discuss some of my teaching experiences and my thoughts on talent selection:</p>
<p>Years of war caused the interruption of the wool industry. Consequently, knitting essentially came to a halt. Now, with the restoration of our nation, the wool industry has reached its peak in recent years. Since the start of autumn, newly opened yarn shops have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain, lined up on Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, as dense as stars in the sky. Thus, there is a great shortage of knitting talent. All of the students in the current 24th class have been hired to serve the community, providing free instruction to customers in order to achieve a thorough understanding of the art of knitting. However, the path to art is not limited to rigid and uninspired methods. It requires the selection of agile minds and the achievement of skills. Factors such as color coordination and the rules of contour rely on genius and wisdom, as well as continuous research, in order to achieve perfection. Therefore, the ladies who take on the role of knitting instructors must also examine their own cultivation, such as the effect of a warm and fulfilling personality! This includes gentle speech, graceful demeanor, and an upright appearance. However, this is not a necessary element among the conditions. As for respect for the shop owner and humility towards colleagues, it should be like a new bride's willingness to consider everything, maintaining an appropriate attitude and remaining a typical lady!</p>
<p>A Window-Shaped Short Outerwear by Sister Gu Lanjun</p>
<h3>Description of the Window-Shaped Short Outerwear</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>Using the window-shaped flower to knit a woolen short jacket, from a distance it looks like a windowpane呢. We used two colors of wool yarn, knitting them apart, which further highlights its beauty. Because the window-shaped pattern has a convex round shape, whether knitting a window-shaped pattern has a style vest, travel outfit, more can take more ordinary tea, it is much better to look at.</p>
<p>Materials: 12 strands of fine yarn, 8 strands of light color, 4 strands of dark color</p>
<p>Tools: One set of single-pointed knitting needles, one set of double-pointed knitting needles, one embroidery needle</p>
<p>Start: Start with 110 stitches for 4 inches of 2 up and 2 down ribs on the side of the hem of the back panel, then knit the window-shaped pattern for one inch, and then increase at the waist, adding one stitch every five rows, to a width of one foot and two inches. When opening the armhole, decrease one stitch on both sides every other row until the back width is five and a half inches long and one foot wide.</p>
<p>Front panel: Knit 4 inches of ribbing at the edge of the hem. The left lapel has 60 stitches and is also knitted in a window-shaped pattern. The increasing at the waist and armhole decreases are mostly the same as the back. The right lapel is also the same.</p>
<p>Sleeves: Cast on 32 stitches at the shoulder and increase stitches on the left and right sides, increasing one stitch every other row until it is even with the armhole. Use four double-pointed needles to join in a circle. Knit 3 inches of ribbing at the cuff. The second pair of sleeves is the same.</p>
<p>Collar: Use dark yarn to knit a double braid and wrap it around the collar. Sew three buttons at the waist.</p>

<h3>Wild Chrysanthemum Cushion</h3>
<p>— Autumn</p>
<p>Knitting art has developed considerably in recent years, partly due to continuous research and partly due to the widespread use of plush materials. Besides being used for coats, vests, and children's clothing, it is also widely used in decorations. This is a cushion woven with a wild chrysanthemum pattern, suitable for sofas, chartered cars, and automobiles, providing a comfortable backrest in all seasons. Not only is the pattern beautiful, but the colors also complement each other, making it elegant and durable. It can also be washed, disassembled, and altered, making it both economical and aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, high-class families generally use this novel cushion to decorate their halls. As for other knitted items such as bedsheets and coarse cloth pillowcases, whether as gifts for relatives and friends or for everyday use, they are both beautiful and unique, and are sure to win praise. Here, we present a model of a domestic cushion for our enthusiasts to use as a reference.</p>

<h3>Reunion Moon</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>A kind of reunion moon, shines on sorrow and shines on joy.</p>
<p>When I received Ying Zikai's</p>
<p>cover painting for the "Free Talk Monthly,"</p>
<p>with these two lines of poetry,</p>
<p>I felt boundless</p>
<p>bewilderment. It's Mid-Autumn Festival again,</p>
<p>the most evocative Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>of the year, especially this</p>
<p>year, this evening, the division</p>
<p>between the levels of sorrow and joy</p>
<p>is even more</p>
<p>profoundly evident.</p>
<p>So, I'm a little tired</p>
<p>of the moon. It is said that the Mid-Autumn Festival moon</p>
<p>is the roundest and brightest. Sun</p>
<p>Fu's poem: "All twelve full moons are</p>
<p>beautiful to see, but the fullest of all is in</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn." Xu Tang's poem: "The power of the moon is</p>
<p>shown every month, but the brightest shine is in</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn." Precisely because under the light of the roundest</p>
<p>and brightest moon, I, who belong</p>
<p>to the sorrowful realm, am</p>
<p>particularly stirred by, or rather,</p>
<p>dissatisfied with reality. Although</p>
<p>the call for thrift resounds through the clouds,</p>
<p>the mooncakes consumed by those seeking pleasure</p>
<p>still rob the poor of a month's</p>
<p>worth of grain, even more so now.</p>
<p>What can be said!</p>
<p>So, I can only simply</p>
<p>fear facing the moon, resent the moon.</p>
<p>Why is it particularly</p>
<p>bright and round during Mid-Autumn? Of course,</p>
<p>the season creates this. The autumn</p>
<p>season is inherently clear, and the autumn colors</p>
<p>are evenly divided tonight, naturally showing the</p>
<p>brightness and roundness of the moon. In the past, Dong</p>
<p>Po heard someone say: "Although Mid-Autumn is tens of thousands</p>
<p>of miles away, one day they will meet and face each other, with the same</p>
<p>weather, whether sunny or cloudy."</p>
<p>It would be strange for the weather to be the same</p>
<p>across tens of thousands of miles. This does not need to be explored. It just</p>
<p>reminds me of Dongpo's "Water Melody," which</p>
<p>is indeed a portrayal of the impoverished class.</p>
<p>The lines "Turns to the vermilion pavilion, lowers to the embroidered door,</p>
<p>shines on the sleepless. There should be no resentment,</p>
<p>why is it rounder at the time of separation."</p>
<p>However, Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty</p>
<p>ordered the singing of this newly popular tune.</p>
<p>"Afraid that the jade towers and mansions,</p>
<p>are unbearable in the high places."</p>
<p>He was so moved that he pardoned his</p>
<p>punishment. Now, how many</p>
<p>people are singing, and how many</p>
<p>are sleepless and resentful? However,</p>
<p>who is moved?</p>
<p>So, the reunion</p>
<p>moon of Mid-Autumn, only when I was a child snuggled</p>
<p>in my mother's arms, pointing</p>
<p>at it with love, I still fear</p>
<p>facing it. I understand that this</p>
<p>relationship is not about the moon, just as Li Lie</p>
<p>wen said in the article he sent me about</p>
<p>Shanghai, "Here I have my</p>
<p>love, and also my hatred and</p>
<p>pain," just as I suspect</p>
<p>that the reunion moon seems to shine particularly on</p>
<p>our poverty and sorrow.</p>
<h3>From Autumn to Mid-Autumn</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhi</p>
<p>In terms of seasons, I love autumn even more.</p>
<p>Autumn grass in the wind, autumn dew glistening, standing in the morning</p>
<p>by the Yangtze River, looking around blankly, gazing into the distance at the autumn water</p>
<p>the same color as the western sky, I can't help but feel that "wealth to</p>
<p>me is like autumn wind passing through my ears." Emperor Wen of Wei's</p>
<p>poem: "The long autumn night is vast, the fierce north wind is</p>
<p>cold," what a clear and cold realm.</p>
<p>Summer nights are short and unbearable. Autumn nights are getting longer, and mosquitoes are getting fewer.</p>
<p>Place a chair and sit in the garden, looking up at the autumn stars</p>
<p>, which is also quite pleasant. Spring makes people lazy</p>
<p>, summer is full of sweat, and winter can only</p>
<p>close the windows, shut the doors, and lie under the covers. Among the four seasons</p>
<p>, only autumn gives people a sense of clarity and freedom</p>
<p>. George Bernard Shaw said: "People must get used to autumn</p>
<p>." Only by getting used to it can one appreciate the true</p>
<p>beauty of autumn. Among the 19th-century British poets</p>
<p>, Byron was better able to appreciate the desolation of autumn</p>
<p>, while Shelley only admired the splendor of spring</p>
<p>. The reason for this is that Shelley was "inhuman"</p>
<p>, while Byron was too "human"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of harvest, gradually</p>
<p>returning from splendor to simplicity, but it is often the most full</p>
<p>and fulfilling time. From spring to autumn, it is like</p>
<p>a person growing from youth to maturity. Therefore, autumn's</p>
<p>other meaning is "maturity," and beyond this there is a feeling of</p>
<p>twilight. Autumn gentlemen and autumn women, although</p>
<p>they symbolize humanity from splendor to withering, if</p>
<p>they realize that this is inevitable, they can be more</p>
<p>open and free. Huainanzi says: "Spring women think</p>
<p>, autumn gentlemen grieve, and know the transformation of things." This also aligns</p>
<p>with Zhuangzi's views in "Wandering Freely" and "The Equality of Things."</p>
<p>Among the entire three months of autumn, the most</p>
<p>lovable is naturally Mid-Autumn. This is the time when "the weather is cool but not yet cold," most suitable for getting close to nature</p>
<p>. Both the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Ninth Festival are good days for enjoyment. Naturally,</p>
<p>in the beginning, the Mid-Autumn Festival had a history of blood and tears</p>
<p>, but as time passed, this day</p>
<p>became a folk festival for "collective enjoyment"</p>
<p>. Today, many villages still have collective activities of small gatherings every three days</p>
<p>and large gatherings every five days, in order to exchange what they have and what they lack, and the so-called "festival"</p>
<p>is just a publicly designated day for collective enjoyment</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The best flower representing Mid-Autumn is the Osmanthus</p>
<p>, after which comes the Chrysanthemum. Li Shen's poem says: "Chrysanthemums</p>
<p>welcome the autumn festival with urgent west wind," this so-called "autumn festival</p>
<p>" is not the Mid-Autumn Festival, but the Double Ninth Festival.</p>
<p>Just as the Double Ninth Festival has chestnut cakes,</p>
<p>the wonderful product of Mid-Autumn is mooncakes. It is said that this year in Shanghai</p>
<p>the price of a large mooncake is easily over ten thousand</p>
<p>yuan. This, in the eyes of public</p>
<p>employees "all in the west wind," is nothing short of</p>
<p>irony. - The salary adjustment for public</p>
<p>employees in August only added one hundred thousand yuan, which is truly</p>
<p>grateful, a meager large mooncake. The creator of the mooncake was Liu Bowen (Ji</p>
<p>), which is said to contain a history of blood and tears of the Han people under foreign</p>
<p>invasion. "Holding</p>
<p>a steel knife ninety-nine times, killing all the barbarians before stopping."</p>
<p>Such folk songs still seem to linger in the ears.</p>
<p>But to this day, the moon still</p>
<p>shines crookedly on the earth. In the hearts of the big-bellied people or dignitaries who eat big mooncakes, is there</p>
<p>still that bloody memory from more than five hundred years ago</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Two years since victory, our lives are still far</p>
<p>from the days of "national rejoicing"</p>
<p>. Looking at the current situation in China, and looking ahead</p>
<p>to Japan, which is putting on the facade of "democracy" and burying itself in rapid</p>
<p>advance, we will be even more ashamed.</p>
<p>If those who eat mooncakes think of the history of blood and tears</p>
<p>contained in the mooncakes, can they also feel something?</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of maturity, but China</p>
<p>, when will your fruits of democracy, the fruits of nation-building,</p>
<p>mature?!</p>
<h3>Man and Moon Reunion</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Although it is said that the moon is better in the West, how</p>
<p>can it compare to my Mid-Autumn Festival? Furthermore, burn incense and prepare offerings,</p>
<p>and eat mooncakes, Eastern Divine Land!</p>
<p>Even more miracles, the city celebrates with wine and meat,</p>
<p>while the wilderness is full of skulls! On this joyous reunion festival,</p>
<p>we should be happy and not ask about sorrow!</p>
<h3>Osmanthus Palace Autumn</h3>
<p>— (Two Verses)</p>
<p>Thinking of the past, resenting the good night, Chang</p>
<p>E's feelings are like the autumn tide, hard to forget Houyi's</p>
<p>bow that bent the moon, deeply afraid that foreign arrows will shoot the sky!</p>
<p>Mourning the end of the kalpa, the chaos of the clan and country, strikes</p>
<p>stop the axe of Wu Gang: the golden wind madly rolls</p>
<p>the laughter of madmen, the jade dew drips for the hungry ghosts!</p>
<h3>This Year's Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Si Guo</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival, in small but famous cities like my hometown in Jiangnan,</p>
<p>is a day of excitement for people. Our city has glass-made</p>
<p>"imperial carriages," including all kinds of lamps</p>
<p>, small flags, and small umbrellas. On Mid-Autumn night, all kinds</p>
<p>of lamps are lit, plus fresh pomegranates, water chestnuts,</p>
<p>and mooncakes. The whole family gathers together to pay respect to the Moon Palace,</p>
<p>which is really fun. Parents pay respect to the big Moon</p>
<p>Palace, and children pay respect to the small Moon Palace, everyone rushing</p>
<p>and bustling, very lively.</p>
<p>This was my childhood. At that time, the world</p>
<p>had not fully recognized the continuity and</p>
<p>latent nature of war, and the power of killing and destruction had not</p>
<p>developed to the extent it has now. People, especially</p>
<p>in smaller cities, although constantly trampled</p>
<p>by civil wars, still appreciated the joy of festivals</p>
<p>. Perhaps life had already begun to slightly threaten</p>
<p>my father, but it was not very hideous and terrifying for us children</p>
<p>. We must celebrate the festival like a festival, my mother said</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The scene at that time, when recalled now</p>
<p>, is both sweet and beautiful: the lamps were so warm</p>
<p>and bright, the light shining from the glass shade in various colors</p>
<p>, twinkling and beautiful and interesting; the mooncakes were so fragrant</p>
<p>and sweet, it seems that people have never been able to make that kind of cake since then</p>
<p>; besides taking out the "imperial carriage" for us to play</p>
<p>with, our parents would also buy many clay figurines and new shoes</p>
<p>for us. Everything was joyous and</p>
<p>wonderful. But now that scene seems to be a historical</p>
<p>relic. When I recall it, there is an unspeakable</p>
<p>melancholy in my heart, a light but deeply sharp melancholy. This is not</p>
<p>just because the beautiful childhood has passed away, because childhood</p>
<p>cannot last forever, but because the peaceful atmosphere of childhood</p>
<p>is no longer there.</p>
<p>Since leaving my hometown, it seems that each year is</p>
<p>worse than the last. The "imperial carriage" has long disappeared</p>
<p>; my parents no longer buy gifts for us on Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>; mooncakes seem to become sweeter and more greasy,</p>
<p>and the so-called lotus seed paste is just sweet potatoes. I started working outside at the age of</p>
<p>seventeen, beginning a bitter life journey</p>
<p>. After the Anti-Japanese War, I suffered in other provinces</p>
<p>. My parents passed away one after another because they were not used to wandering life</p>
<p>. Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, I just go through the motions</p>
<p>, and only a sense of indifferent</p>
<p>sadness rises in my heart towards the big, cool, round, and white moon.</p>
<p>What about this year? Logically speaking, returning to my</p>
<p>hometown to celebrate the first Mid-Autumn Festival after victory should be very happy</p>
<p>. But the country is still in turmoil, and I myself am being held tightly</p>
<p>by life, unable to even catch my breath.</p>
<p>I have no heart to enjoy the moon. The little beautiful</p>
<p>childish dreams of the Anti-Japanese War have been awakened</p>
<p>. The world is facing the most terrifying trap</p>
<p>, and one careless step will lead to a fall. Suspicion, hatred, pride, and ignorance</p>
<p>are growing day by day, and everyone understands that</p>
<p>avoiding the next war is not easy.</p>
<p>The worried even shout, "Let's fight it early, an early fight can preserve a part!"</p>
<p>In the past, if A and B had a feud, fighting would settle it whoever lost</p>
<p>; now several groups containing fractions of all mankind each hold a set of</p>
<p>irreconcilable theories, wanting to destroy, if</p>
<p>not to conquer the rest of mankind. The result of this struggle</p>
<p>is hard to imagine, because the two premises of self-defense and defending the</p>
<p>truth do not allow people to let go halfway</p>
<p>. But to this day, no wisdom has emerged to</p>
<p>eliminate people's doubts and strengthen</p>
<p>people's faith in loving others as themselves. Festivals have long been</p>
<p>neglected by people, except for a few extremely rich</p>
<p>or those who never care about the future.</p>
<p>Today, in many small but famous cities</p>
<p>in Jiangnan, the Mid-Autumn Festival still has its irresistible</p>
<p>charm. The sky is clear, and the moon is beautiful</p>
<p>. But people's hearts are heavy. I</p>
<p>can't help but sincerely pray for our generation and the next generation.</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Festival in America</h3>
<p>— Shu Yuan</p>
<p>"The moon is extraordinarily bright at Mid-Autumn," which does not depend on region or nationality. I</p>
<p>have not said that the bright moon is brighter in America than in China. But the same bright moon, in</p>
<p>America, shines on abundant crops, towering factories, prosperous cities, and couples</p>
<p>shoulder to shoulder. In China, it shines on the broken battlefields, the howling of grief across the fields, the hoarded granaries, and the</p>
<p>homeless who sleep in the open air, that light seems more suppressed</p>
<p>. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I lived in Hengyang and Chengdu for the first four years. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, enemy planes would definitely</p>
<p>arrive to drop bombs, making it impossible to celebrate the festival. In the latter four years, I stayed in the United States, like Su Wu herding sheep, with no interest in</p>
<p>holding chrysanthemums and appreciating the moon. For eight or nine years, there were not many mooncakes imported</p>
<p>. I had hoped to return victorious and enjoy a feast</p>
<p>, but unexpectedly the legal tender depreciated, and mooncakes rose in price. At the same time, there was talk of thrift</p>
<p>, and civil servants did not give or receive gifts. I could not afford to buy them, and no one sent them to me</p>
<p>. "When rituals are lost, seek them among the wild," let's talk about celebrating Mid-Autumn in America:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are most interested in celebrating festivals, because they work hard all year round and want to</p>
<p>celebrate the festivals in a lively way. As the Autumn Festival approaches, the Chinese grocery stores</p>
<p>in the major ports of New York and San Francisco are piled high with Cantonese-style mooncakes and incense burners</p>
<p>. Mooncakes are not only bought by Chinese people.</p>
<p>Americans also like to eat Mooncake. Foreign ladies eat mooncakes</p>
<p>and spread and even fabricate many stories about Chang E in the moon</p>
<p>, showing how knowledgeable and up to date they are.</p>
<p>Chinese. Overseas Chinese take a day off on Mid-Autumn Festival, burning incense</p>
<p>in front of the God of Wealth. And making a big scene on the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>The assembly halls such as the Anliang Hall have a God of Wealth Hall, and are equipped</p>
<p>with a full set of Lantern Festival instruments, gongs and drums, sounding through the sky</p>
<p>. After the Lantern Festival is celebrated, Pai Gow and gambling games</p>
<p>take off, determined to enjoy the day. Cantonese theaters usually post plays such as "Chang E Flies to the Moon,"</p>
<p>but young overseas Chinese prefer to walk arm in arm in the moonlight to the depths of the gardens</p>
<p>, spending their precious time. One year on Mid-Autumn Festival, a young overseas Chinese woman invited me to her home to celebrate the festival</p>
<p>. After drinking and eating my fill, I felt that the moon was especially bright late at night.</p>
<p>Now the situation is very different. Eating Guan Sheng's bread and drinking Chang Tu's wine,</p>
<p>is Mid-Autumn Festival betraying me, or am I betraying Mid-Autumn Festival?</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Moon</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>This year's Mid-Autumn Moon,</p>
<p>Shows more of separation and chaos!</p>
<p>Because we talk about thrift,</p>
<p>Chang E in the moon does not dance?</p>
<p>The moon is extraordinarily bright at Mid-Autumn, how</p>
<p>many families are separated and chaotic, how many are happy? Today we are talking about thrift</p>
<p>, even affecting Chang E in the moon, who no longer dances!</p>
<p>Note: "Shi Zhou Ji" says that there is</p>
<p>Chang E in the moon, dancing under the osmanthus tree.</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn and Osmanthus</h3>
<p>— Yue Feng</p>
<p>"Enjoyable Things" (written by Zhang Yuezai of the Song Dynasty) says, "In August, go to the mountains to find osmanthus, many wonderful</p>
<p>Mountain Osmanthus, Qi Geng Ting Qianye Osmanthus, the painting of Immortals</p>
<p>Building, viewing the Moon and the Osmanthus, climbing the Osmanthus," which shows that</p>
<p>viewing the moon and appreciating the osmanthus are inseparable elegant pastimes</p>
<p>. The connection between the osmanthus and the moon was established long before the Tang Dynasty,</p>
<p>such as when Emperor Chen Hou created the Osmanthus Palace for Zhang Lihua behind the Guangzhao Palace</p>
<p>, making a round door like the moon. In the Tang Dynasty, however, the osmanthus was transplanted to the moon</p>
<p>. Wang Wei's poem, "The osmanthus spirit is first born, and the autumn dew is slight," indicates that at that time</p>
<p>some people had already seen the osmanthus tree in the moon.</p>
<p>Although Wu Gang, who cuts the osmanthus tree, was a Han Chinese, this story</p>
<p>was first seen in the Tang Dynasty's "Miscellaneous Records of Youyang"</p>
<p>, which shows that it was still a creation that harmed people. When Xie Shen wrote his strategies, he called himself a branch of the osmanthus forest</p>
<p>, so the osmanthus tree was intertwined with the autumn examination, simply calling passing the examination</p>
<p>"picking osmanthus."</p>
<p>In modern times, in Yunnan in August, there is an</p>
<p>Osmanthus Flower Market. In Xindu, Sichuan, there is Osmanthus Lake, and the lakeside</p>
<p>has clusters of osmanthus trees, as many as two hundred or more, stretching for a mile</p>
<p>, all hundreds of years old. Around Mid-Autumn Festival, the fragrance</p>
<p>reaches several miles away, and travelers fill the road. In the past, the Wu custom of watching osmanthus</p>
<p>involved the entire city turning out, like a dragon boat race.</p>
<p>The osmanthus flowers of Baozang Temple in Beijing are also very famous</p>
<p>. From this, we can know that the osmanthus tree is commonly planted throughout the north and south of China</p>
<p>. On a bright moonlit night, the swaying shadow of the osmanthus, with strands of sweet fragrance</p>
<p>, talking about family ethics, and spending the festival, is indeed a supreme</p>
<p>pleasure.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I asked my teacher why the</p>
<p>moon revolves around the earth, but we always only see</p>
<p>Wu Gang cutting down the tree (this is the view of the Jiahu area), and not see</p>
<p>the other sides of the moon.</p>
<p>That teacher was truly knowledgeable. He said that when the moon</p>
<p>revolves around the earth, it is also rotating itself at the same time</p>
<p>, just like the earth revolving around the sun. The only</p>
<p>difference is that the moon's rotation time is exactly</p>
<p>one lunar month, which is equal to the time it takes to revolve around the earth</p>
<p>once. Therefore, although it keeps</p>
<p>revolving around the earth, it always only lets us</p>
<p>see the side with Wu Gang and the osmanthus tree.</p>
<p>As for what happened after Wu Gang cut down the tree, whether Wu Gang had</p>
<p>a wife and children, etc., it would not let us</p>
<p>see. I say that teacher was knowledgeable</p>
<p>, because he was an elementary school teacher thirty years ago</p>
<p>. I later talked about this question with many geography teachers and friends</p>
<p>, and they all said they had not paid attention to it.</p>
<h3>The Story of Mid-Autumn</h3>
<p>— Han Xiao</p>
<p>Time seems to pass especially fast, and in the</p>
<p>blink of an eye, it's Mid-Autumn Festival again.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mid-Autumn, one can't help but think</p>
<p>of the Mid-Autumn moon. In China, there are many bizarre</p>
<p>legends about the Mid-Autumn moon. Let the author</p>
<p>write two paragraphs below as gifts to commemorate the Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Chang E Flies to the Moon According to legend, more than four thousand years</p>
<p>ago, in the Xia Dynasty, Houyi assisted Emperor Xiang in governing the country</p>
<p>, and begged the Queen Mother of the West for the elixir of immortality. His wife Chang</p>
<p>E (also called Heng E) stole it and fled to the moon. In this way, she would</p>
<p>live forever and dwell permanently on</p>
<p>the moon. The people have adapted her into a play, which</p>
<p>must be performed on stage every festival.</p>
<p>The Old Man Under the Moon Some people believe that there is</p>
<p>a jade rabbit in the moon. In Buddhism, it is also believed that</p>
<p>that rabbit was a devout Buddhist who voluntarily sacrificed</p>
<p>his lifelong happiness for the sake of the Bodhisattva. Heaven, in order to reward</p>
<p>its loyalty, made it</p>
<p>reborn, and thus became the Old Man Under the Moon. This old man</p>
<p>shoulders all the missions of the moon god, especially</p>
<p>promoting the marriage of lovers. So to this day,</p>
<p>there are still many superstitious and loving women who</p>
<p>cut white paper into the shape of rabbits on Mid-Autumn Day</p>
<p>and place them inside their daughters' shoes. They believe that</p>
<p>their daughters will soon be able to choose</p>
<p>a satisfactory husband and thus marry and live to old age together</p>
<p>.</p>
<h3>When the Moon is Full</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhuang</p>
<p>Zhu Renkong Pingzhong's moon-viewing poem says: "The round ice mirror emits pure splendor</p>
<p>, is tonight like last night? I only fear that the moonlight has no likes or dislikes, but pity that people's hearts</p>
<p>have fullness and emptiness."</p>
<p>We always feel that the moon of Mid-Autumn is particularly full</p>
<p>and exceptionally bright, so moon-viewing must be on Mid-Autumn night.</p>
<p>In fact, on the fourteenth, although there is still a line of incompleteness</p>
<p>, as far as our naked eyes can see, we already feel that it is very full</p>
<p>. And on the sixteenth, in fact, Mid-Autumn has long passed</p>
<p>, but when you look up at the bright moon, who can distinguish where it is incomplete</p>
<p>? After the sixteenth, it should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>We always have endless hope for the future</p>
<p>, believing that everything can be as ideal as possible; we also</p>
<p>tend to have feelings of nostalgia and sentimentality for everything in the past</p>
<p>. Until things have passed and circumstances have changed, as if the moon has already waned</p>
<p>, looking back at the scene of the waxing crescent, reminiscing</p>
<p>about the past, it instead increases many beautiful memories</p>
<p>!</p>
<p>The so-called "moonlight has no likes or dislikes, and people's hearts have fullness and emptiness." Everything in the universe is not</p>
<p>absolute. If we can think one step back, we will naturally have endless joy</p>
<p>, while deliberately seeking perfection and being endlessly greedy</p>
<p>often only results in grasping an empty black shadow.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said: "Holding to fullness is not as good as stopping; sharpening to sharpness cannot be long preserved. Gold and jade fill the hall, but none can keep them; wealth and nobility with pride invite their own blame. To retire when the task is accomplished is the Way of Heaven."</p>
<p>In all things under heaven, when things reach an extreme, they will be reversed; when prosperity reaches its peak, it will decline, and when adversity reaches its end, prosperity will come. But if you can often see a crescent moon, you can have endless hope. By the twelfth or thirteenth day, you will gradually have the intention of splendor. As for after the sixteenth, the day is eclipsed, and how can you hide it?</p>
<p>Maintaining fullness and preserving stability is an old saying, but retreating bravely in the face of a raging current is still considered a wise move. Do moon-viewers have this intention?</p>
<h3>Autumn Night Moon</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival. Clear and long sky,</p>
<p>congealed dewdrops, constrained liver yang. Calculating material prices,</p>
<p>trivial matters of rice and salt. How</p>
<p>many things, occasionally recalling, old sorrows are difficult to stop</p>
<p>. Passive; the heart's screen will not be lifted tonight.</p>
<p>Friends and relatives are far away, working as expatriates,</p>
<p>like prodigal sons, all extravagance is buttoned up. Past</p>
<p>romantic dreams, melting ice and snow, leaving</p>
<p>mountains and rivers (or hometown), all broken</p>
<p>. Desolate and sad. Afraid to look at the exquisite</p>
<p>round moon late at night.</p>
<h3>Old Customs of the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ruo</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn, commonly known as the Eighth Month Half, on this evening, families each have</p>
<p>banquets to celebrate the festival. People also use the weather of this night to predict</p>
<p>the weather of the next Lantern Festival, saying, "If clouds cover the moon on the fifteenth of the eighth month,</p>
<p>next year's Lantern Festival will be rained on." It is also said: "Rain beats the Lantern Festival lights, clouds</p>
<p>cover the Mid-Autumn moon." Cai Yun's poem says: "Heart heavy, Mid-Autumn clouds cover the moon,</p>
<p>at dawn, Lantern Festival clothes are drenched by rain, who knows when the bean flowers bloom,</p>
<p>nurturing rice is just right with water overflowing." Thus, the interests of farmers and the leisurely</p>
<p>are indeed quite different. Zhou Gong's collection has the line, "I only wish not to see the moon during Mid-Autumn,</p>
<p>to get rain beating the Lantern Festival lights," truly the words of a benevolent man. However, for elegant scholars who enjoy watching the moon and appreciating lanterns, wouldn't they consider this</p>
<p>"too much of a buzzkill?"</p>
<p>On the evening of Mid-Autumn, every household has flower arrangements and fragrant candles, worshipping towards the sky:</p>
<p>Children kowtow under the moon, playing in front of the lanterns, called worshiping the moon palace. Lu Qi's Beijing Annual Customs records: "On the evening of Mid-Autumn,</p>
<p>families each set up an image of the moon palace talisman, with a rabbit standing like a human on the talisman.</p>
<p>Fruits and melons are placed in the courtyard, and the cake surface is painted with a toad and rabbit in the moon. Men and women respectfully worship and burn incense,</p>
<p>and then burn it." Now, it is not customary to set up images of moon palace talismans, only to worship towards the sky.</p>
<p>In Wu customs, there is also the burning of incense buckets. Incense shops make buckets with incense sticks,</p>
<p>and fill them with incense powder. Monks and laypeople alike buy them, burning them under the moon.</p>
<p>You Songzhen's poem on incense buckets says: "Picking up incense threads, evenly and finely,</p>
<p>making them into the same shape as a bucket, only suitable for spiritual sandalwood mixed with wood shavings,</p>
<p>how could fine wine be stored in the jade palace, beautiful women lower the curtains and bend their waists frequently,</p>
<p>scholars read the stars and leave the handle empty, Wu customs pass on elegant stories during Mid-Autumn,</p>
<p>the fragrant osmanthus fills the courtyard, right in the wind."</p>
<p>Another poem says: "Ashamed I have no beautiful verses to collect mountain fragrance, talent and thought are difficult to measure this thing,</p>
<p>candle flames rush up, spearing through the moon, the sandalwood core sinks, like a gallbladder in a bag,</p>
<p>the smoke still forms delicate examination essays, the ashes still leave a square seal pattern, if a group of</p>
<p>true immortals descends to the mortal realm late at night, they would not mind singing rainbow skirts in a small room." In Hangzhou customs, they</p>
<p>paste paper to make a bucket, burning incense inside. The tall ones can be about two feet high. Wu Manyun's poem says: "The heart character burns to the end, inch by inch ashes, spiritual incense asks the moon wheel to open:</p>
<p>what the bucket measures is ultimately little in the human world, freshly harvested osmanthus grains are ten thousand bushels."</p>
<p>Women dress up and go out to play, visiting each other, or following along to temples as they please.</p>
<p>The rooster crows, yet they still dance under the moon, called walking the moonlight.</p>
<p>Cai Yun's poem says: "Osmanthus flower balls press down on silk fragrance, in twos and threes, sisters walk,</p>
<p>walking in the cold, not minding the thin silk sleeves, on the road they hate that their skirts are too long."</p>
<p>Villagers in the wilderness stack tiles to form a seven-story pagoda, with</p>
<p>an image of Ksitigarbha in the middle, lit with lamps all around, called pagoda lamps. This is meant to</p>
<p>illuminate the underworld, not just for sightseeing. Mei Shuangyai's poem says:</p>
<p>"No need to reduce the rammed earth layers, one pillar supporting the sky, seven levels of lights, the bronze sparrow terrace ashes leave pieces,</p>
<p>the spiritual light palace gravel accumulates layers, the candle dragon scales rush up to the sky palace, the toad pearls rise from the ground,</p>
<p>gentlemen and ladies pour out of the city, standing and watching, the rice star and bright moon increase the scenery even more."</p>
<p>Families give mooncakes as Mid-Autumn Festival gifts. On the fifteenth night,</p>
<p>they arrange fruits and melons to offer before the moon-worshiping feast. Qi Qi's poem says:</p>
<p>"Mid-Autumn Festival gifts are not cheap, fire stoves are busy, fresh from the pot,</p>
<p>the same cake makers have newly made, good names are first written toward the moon." The West Lake Travelogue records: "During Mid-Autumn, the common people give each other mooncakes,</p>
<p>taking the meaning of reunion." Wu Manyun's Jiangxiang Festival Objects poem preface:</p>
<p>"Hangzhou customs eat mooncakes during Mid-Autumn, setting up a moon-worshiping feast at night, taking the meaning of human and moon becoming</p>
<p>round." The poem says: "Powdered cream, round shadow, the moon divides its light, not</p>
<p>red silk, yet one eats to be full, only fearing that the reunion is empty talk on the cake, how many soldiers</p>
<p>have not yet returned home." This poem, even if moved to today, is very relevant.</p>
<p>Mooncakes come in many styles, with the more expensive ones selling for millions, with painted</p>
<p>figures and a hundred scenes on the surface, decorated gorgeously, the common people look at them like the moon palace,</p>
<p>unable to immediately obtain them. After the victory, atomic mooncakes were prevalent on the market,</p>
<p>I wonder if there will be flying saucer mooncakes appearing this autumn.</p>
<h3>Feelings on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the Thirty-Sixth Year</h3>
<p>— Bao Zaizi</p>
<p>The occupied area is still not recovered, already two weeks. The local</p>
<p>evolution, the atmosphere is bleak. Rain and dew, thunder, and advancement are out of sync,</p>
<p>bandits and the smoke of war arise everywhere. People's hearts are unpredictable, families</p>
<p>drift and scatter. Restraining oneself and waiting, eyes looking for the dawn to break.</p>
<p>Scratching my head and asking the sky, my heart is alarmed by the red flames flying.</p>
<p>Looking around the realm, snakes and dragons compete, chickens and dogs are not peaceful.</p>
<p>I only see crows everywhere, cawing randomly into the wind.</p>
