<h3>國防次長報告軍事　魯戰局不久可結束　壽光鄄城鉅野相繼收復</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕魯境戰局好轉，國防部次長劉士毅，八日晨在政院作眾事以告時，曾以樂觀語調謂：魯境戰事不久可望告一段落。渠稱：共匪劉伯誠部被國軍壓迫，已困於黃河以南，律浦路以西之三角地帶，陳毅匪部亦被國軍隔於津浦路以東，陳部兩個縱隊，曾竄鐵路以西，企圖與劉部會合，但已被國軍包圍，此種情形，堪稱良好，如無其他意外，魯境戰局短期內可告一結東。交次譚伯羽繼劉報告交通情形謂：交部着重於鐵路·公路於綫之修復，關於膠濟路，過去數次打通，復數次被破壞，故該部決定在山東戰局明朗化告一段落以前，擬暫緩修理。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南八日電〕魯西殲滅大戰，日內將再展開。劉伯誠主力及陳毅主力殘部，現被國軍園困於黃河以南運河以西宋江河兩岸地區，除以一部渡河北竄外，因董口迄由國軍堅守，其餘共匪渡河困難，將在魯西逐漸被殲。又國軍保安部隊，八日早五時渡河直搗壽光，沿途排除抵抗，九時克復壽光縣城，刻在外闈掃蕩中。</p>

<p>〔本報靑島八日電〕益都國軍北進，抵壽光城西，展開政城戰。膠縣國軍續攻高密，淄川·博山亦即可收復·膠濟全綫刻全入國軍掌握，再度打通之期不遠</p>
<h3>榆林外圍激戰　冀省三縣長復員</h3>
<p>〔中央社榆林八日電〕陝北共匪新一旅，獨四旅，教二旅，三五八旅，三五九旅并騎兵一旅，於五日晚分股向榆林外圍國軍陣地猛犯，守備該地之國軍，依外圍重點三岔灣，五里塔及南關外高地等處憑險固守，戰况激烈異常。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏七日電〕土木耳合東北四十華里雷生貴村，頃發現烏勒吉敖蘇爾蒙匪騎兵千餘？有進犯綏東企圖。伊盟鄂托克旗情勢混亂，已故保安司令章文軒之姪章耀武被叛徒馬福剛，馬良誠等扣捕，楊森扎布離旗前往寗夏，王府衛除及旗務由其弟扎木森扎布負責代理，在毛腦海廟布防，省府及蒙政會派往鄂旗調解內部糾紛之薛佩印及奇全禧等，已到達桃力甲，現安邊匪王震部積極準備北犯，並企圖切斷綏寗交通，寗軍在吳忠堡附近之牛頭山增調主力戒備。</p>

<h3>憲政會委員舉行座談　商普選實際問題　提示三點促請政府注意</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕國代聯誼會訊，憲政促進會留京一部份委員發起憲政座談會，於六日晚七時假座成賢街招待所舉行，到有郭衡，段炳麟，陳時昌·宋東岱，趙振洲，沈靈修，郭安宇，王廣慶，友恒祥，李正韜，周蔭棠，崔承助，賴偉英，陳翊忠，黃紹美，段劍岷，趙靑譽，羅紹徽，王丕緒，丁宣孝，石啟貴，冷剛鋒，粟顯揚，戴天球，暨立監委員通天祥，張祿等五十餘人，對於本年普選問題，各抒意見：（一）此次立法院規定各省市立法委員名額，係以十六年至二十五年間各省市所報戶口最多一年之數爲準，以戰前數字估計，作爲戰後之選舉根據，實際欠確，流幣必多。以四川爲例，二十五年所報人口係五千一百萬餘人，現報係四千一百萬餘人，相差達千餘萬人之多，而立法院以二十五年人口數爲準規定其應選出立參名額，則將來投票，實際多餘千萬選票。試問作何處置？（二）東北華北各省，被共匪盤據或滋擾地區，計有二十二省市，此等地區若出之變通辦法，如類似遴選指定等，則顯然違法，且剝削選民之權利，不辦更難湊足準備程序第八條總額三分之二之規定，將何處置？（三）政黨比例分配名額問題，各黨雖諱莫如深，而事實上在礎商中，果然，勢必出以統制包辦，分割民意，違反民主，必遭人民之反對，不統制，小黨產生不易，又可以退出政府爲要挾。以上三點難題，發言紛紛，未獲結論。此外目前北方人禍，南方天災，人民痛苦流離，救死不邋，徵兵徵糧又加以徵「票」，其對選舉之興趣如何，不難想像，又舉國正在總動員戡亂之際，軍人參加競選，則前方弛懈，不參加則權利受剝削，其他短期內種種選舉事務技衛等能否辦理週到，亦非一紙公文可以奏效。總之，此次大選爲百年憲政之開端，上述難題必須切實解決，不能遷就馬虎了事，故參加者一致認爲政府應正視寶際事實，尊市民意，審愼辦理選舉。</p>
<h3>各省市選舉委會　八月廿日前成立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕選舉總事務所八日下午四時開委員會議，決定全國各省市選舉委會一律限八月廿日前成立。今日出席會議者爲張厲生，劉東岩，蔣勻出，金體乾，王斌等七人，洪蘭友未到，決議：（一）立委區選舉事務所委員人選，可由省選所提請選總核派，各縣市及其同等區國代選所委負人選，得由各該省選所遴荐呈候核定再派，惟以上人選之決定，應由該省選舉委員會通過再行呈荐。（二）甘肅·上海等省市請以公民證代選舉權證，惟選舉權證之發給，選舉法有硬性規定，未便變通。（三）派孫邦華任桑提亞哥區僑選所主席委員。（四）不能寫字之選民，得在選舉塲所自行請人代書，並加蓋選舉人私章或捺右大姆指模，以示愼重，不必出主管選所另行專設代書人。（五）監院函請說明「曾服公務有貪污行爲，並經依法彈劾已送懲戒及審判拘傳無着，呈請通緝之人員，有無選舉權及被選權案」決議：「凡非具有選舉法規定消極條件之一者，其選舉權及被選權依法均應存在，至能否行使，聽其自然」。（六）全國各有市選舉委會，限八月廿日前成立，依法召開會議，並將所屬各級選所委員人選遴荐，電報總所核派。</p>

<p>掠我物資堆積東京交涉歸還尙無結果</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕日本在戰爭期內所掠奪各國之物資，現不分類別，堆積於東京四大倉庫內，由美軍負保管之責。物資之類別甚多，工廠機件，珠寶，傢俱，古盤均有，大部份爲自中國搶來，小部份來自南洋及菲律賓。我駐日代表團巳屢次向盟軍總部要求歸還，但對方要求兩項證件：（一）物權證件，（二）被敵人搶去之證明。現盟軍總部堅持以歐洲爲例，因德軍搬走佔領國物資時，均出收條，如要求日本亦採同樣辦法，事實上不無困難之處。最近麥帥擬將此類物資在日本公開出售，即以價款作爲日本之出口基金，我國現正在華府竭力反對，並主張先由菲律賓及南洋各國憑適當證據領回被掠之物資，而將其餘之物資悉數運至上海先由私人憑證件領回被刧物件，其剩餘者在市上公開拍賣，作爲政府之收益。截至此時爲止，交涉尚無結果。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者為明瞭我國各區走私詳情，特走訪有關方面，承詳為解答如下：（一）華南區—此爲全國走私最烈之區，走私物品包括香烟，染料，麵粉，牛奶，火油，西藥，化粧品，人造絲，紗布，捲煙紙等，其走私方式有偷運。利用行總救濟物資船隻及武裝走私等。凡此走私活動。均以港，澳兩地爲中心。有關方面已於兩地之外關，集中巡艦及陸卡之力量，加以包圍。惟以海面遼闊。我方不能全部控制，且以武器配備不夠，過去未收全效，目前正在加強人事及配備中。（二）台灣區—近日來日本貨物及朝鮮貨物，以走私方式，流入台灣甚多。私貨以海產品為大宗，因台灣本身雖爲一島，但高貴之海味如魚翅，海參等，則並不出產。台糖亦有走私至日本者，但爲數不多。最近台灣海面之走私事件，已破獲多起，有關方面對此頗重視，已派艦巡視台灣海峽；惟台灣區之走私，已查明為有組織之大規模行動，須各機關通力合作，方能收肅清之效。（三）華北區—過去有一時期，走私甚為猖獗，特別安東與朝鮮僅一水之隔，更爲走私之主要孔道。自安東棄守後，該方面已情况不明。自政府下令封鎖華北各海口後，走私之機會已少。至於外傳華北近有日貨走私之說，上海方面尚未接得報告。在中日和約未訂立之前，日本貨船不能開入我國之港口，故大量走私，爲不可能。（四）海南島方面亦有小規模之走私，貨物來自越南，以布疋等爲大宗。有關方面預言：中日通商後，台灣及華北區之日貨走私，勢所難免，因日本有充分之貨物及船隻，用於出口方面，而其價格抵廉，亦爲倘費者所歡迎。同時，久享盛譽之高麗人參，恐仍將爲暢銷之私貨。又若干貨物之走私進口，目的並本在逃避關稅，而爲我國進口限額太嚴，不能滿足工商業之需要所造成，故根絕走私，亦與政府之經濟政策有關。至於出口走私，目的在逃避結匯，因官價外匯與黑市相去太遠。</p>

<h3>紓救國家經濟困難　富豪有錢應出錢　伍純武等對開征財產捐之意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕開征財產捐事，全經會七日開會討論時，以此事辦理困難，手續上殊有詳加研討必要，決議由立院參政會等機關聯合舉行擴大座談會，俾共同商討。記者八日分訪參政員伍純武，尹述賢。武肇煦。張　華及立委劉不同，譚惕吾等，探詢彼等對開征財產捐之意見，綜合彼等看法，僉認國家經濟狀况困難至此程度，富豪應本「有濺出錢」之旨，踴蹟輸將，並爲天下創。彼等對於全經會原擬之向十億元以上富翁普遍征捐一事認爲得難茍同。蓋此捐若普遍實行，則中下之家咸將受其紛擾，而眞正富豪，反得規避，殊失創議此捐之原旨。</p>
<p>伍純武</p>
<p>指出政府若能向大戶入手，不特可以彌補財政赤字且可挽回人心，蓋目前之現象，爲征借征實征丁，咸由貧民負擔，殊失公平。織亂首要之圖，在得人民擁護，而向富戶入手，即爲最好辦法。</p>
<p>張潛華</p>
<p>主張選擇一二富豪開征。記者詢以此事在法律無據，張稱，抗戰時期以一紙法令，沒收四成黃金存款，今日有何不可以此同樣方法對付豪門。渠認情形已至於此，吾人決不能再予姑息。</p>
<p>尹述賢</p>
<p>認若爲配合動員，則以向富豪入手爲宜，若爲永久建設計，則應普遍征收財產謂，渠認當務之急，爲如何配合動員，因爲向少數富豪開征即爲巳足，不必再多擾民。向有大砲之稱之</p>
<p>武肇烈</p>
<p>認天下滔滔者皆是若向富豪入手徵捐，應求其勿有漏糖，凡國人所公認之豪門，皆應在輪捐之列。此事應另訂一富有革命性之特別法，使富豪無法逃進。武又建議一較爲簡便易行之辦法，由政府明白公布私人在美存款，並予征用，此事美商會有建議，儘可再循外交途徑，與美方商洽。</p>
<p>劉不同</p>
<p>則認普遍開征財產捐，碍　施行，渠指出眞正富豪，其動產不動產皆無法查得，則其銀行中之存款，亦無從查明，渠叫出一頓爲新穎之口號，即富豪應恢復民國十六年前生活，蓋目前家財億萬之富豪，彼時固多住亭子問者。劉並指出漢武帝時實行上　錢之勢法，認歷史上不乏此種例證，若僅從十億元以上財產之普通富戶開征，則其結果，必致　民，而真正富豪反得逍遙法外。</p>

<h3>社論　急謀搶救蘇北水災</h3>
<p>寗靜了幾月的蘇北？近又發生水災，且災情慘重。據本報電訊：此次蘇北水災起因，先是大雨冲積河流，沂水沭水發生泛濫，致徐海淮屬各縣，河流所經之地，皆爲洪水所掩，災區達一二十縣，並在繼續泛濫中。據蘇省黨部汪主委賓瑄，四日對新聞界報告：截至目前，被淹田地至千萬畝，無家可歸之災胞，估計達百萬人以上，受災最重之縣，首推邳縣。該縣四鄉已成一片汪洋，淹斃人畜，到處漂流，慘不忍睹。蘇省主席王懋功，五日復沉痛指出：蘇省頻年多故，去歲組告安定，近又以水災聞，災悄慘重，秋收無望，實爲一大隱憂。黃淮二水現繼續上漲，如再泛濫不已，則蘇北三十六縣勢將盡成澤國，非急謀搶救，實不堪設想。看今日災情實况，回溯往昔遍地瘡痍，大災凶年，浩刧蘇北，論其嚴重，並不减於兩廣等處災情；論其隱患，則似更甚於兩廣各地，切望政府當局雙社會人士，急謀搶救！</p>
<p>蘇北，乃江蘇省北部，含有淮河南北地域，徐海淮屬之地。今有卅六縣治；其位置，東濱黃海，南面長江，西接皖北豫東，北跨津浦綫，緊接山東。其地文，昔爲黃河舊道，自元代黃河南遷，篡奪淮水，淮失入海正道，而鬱積於洪澤湖，由他水間接分歸江海，故今之蘇北，以淮河爲緯，運河爲經，全境地形低下，河渠縱橫，大水之年，河面水盛增高，而容淮水之量有限，當淮水無路可洩時，必爲禍下流，尤以要下河一帶爲甚。抗戰八年，蘇北河政廢弛，復員以後，共黨竄擾，專以掠奪爲能，不事建設，不問河政，各縣人民，時抱陸沉之懼。國軍重光蘇北後，政府和行總進行救濟，未及一年，已現復蘇之象：情各縣伏莽，迄未完全肅淸，正竚待各境大災，進行煽動，利用災民，以作更大的滋擾。蘇北的隱患，潛伏在此；不幸此次禍水來襲，遍地災黎，瘡痍復現，情况慘淡：如不急起搶救，治本治標，解民倒懸，蘇北的前途，實在憂患無窮。</p>
<p>關於蘇北水災的救濟，地方政府和蘇省人士，已予深切的注意；不過這種消極的「憐憫」是不够的，希望中央政府，聯總行總，全省各界，從治本治標上着力，以求蘇北的安定。蘇北安定，則江南繁榮。蘇北安定，上海無旦夕之禍；江南繁榮，上海無匱乏之虞。我們於此願略抒治本治標之道，以供關係方面參考。</p>
<p>消極的救濟水災，是治標的辦法。據本報八日電訊，政府已撥賑款十億，罐頭一萬箱，救濟泛區災民。同時蘇省會各界，正發起組織一徐淮海水災念賑會」，爲蘇北災胞向滬各界呼籲，設法寡款二百億，並請行總趕撥麵粉五千噸，以作賑濟之需。我們希望蘇省各界，迅既開始籌募賑款，其散發的方法，務需注重實效，以扶助難民歸鄉，災農歸耕：政府更須豁免兵糧徵發，助其復興。至積極的治水，建設蘇北，　是治本之道。昔日陳果夫氏主蘇時，曾有導淮計劃，并開始辦理，不幸抗戰爆發而中輟，蘇省府於蘇北重光後，又制定「開發蘇北五年計劃」，尤對防海灌溉排水，計劃周詳：惟以所需工程費爲三千二百億，中央地方財政，均無法應付，計劃仍不免落空。行總蘇寗分署，爲配合蘇北黃泛善後工作，亦訂三項計劃，如辦理導淮，修復沂河沭河，及沿海閘壩，若果實施，均能有裨益於蘇北農田水利。我們希望蘇省政府，銳　於有爲：以蘇北建設，蘇北復興，爲一切施政重點，根據既定計劃，促進中央及行總，注力於蘇北水利之治，如國庫短絀，亦應別籌辦法，付諸實行。宜昌水閘工程中途停頓，鄂民有自動捐獻復工之議：可是凡事祇要有中心，不是絕無辦法的。</p>
<p>總之，目前蘇北是很重要的，它是江蘇省的半壁，在抗戰期中，徐州大會戰，武漢得以鞏固，徐海民力物力，貢獻匪尠，徐海淪陷，卅六縣遭受嚴重災患，復員以來，又飽經兵燹，今淮河一帶一片汪洋，難民百萬，衣無着，住無處，嗷嗷待哺，歸鄉復耕，善後救濟，實屬刻不容緩；望各方人士，本人　己溺精神，多予救濟，以拯救蘇北千餘萬人民於禍水之中，嘉惠蘇北。蘇北安定，蘇北回復寗靜，江南得以繁榮，江蘇全省以反國家前途，關係都很重要，願急謀搶救蘇北水災。</p>
<h3>經濟風潮襲曼谷　汕遠洋公司支行倒閉後華僑匯款損失一百卅億</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷七日電〕當此問昨晚自香港及汕頭電報中獲悉，汕頭遠洋公司支行倒閉之消息後，經濟風潮，再度進　曼谷，經由該公司匯款回國之華僑，所遭受之損失，迄今所知者，已超出一百卅億元。據稱：此乃遇羅華僑從未遭過之嚴重經濟之危機，有資格之觀察家，認爲曼谷中國錢莊業，至少在兩週之內，將完全陷於停滯。</p>

<h3>政府經濟緊急措施法案　英下院二讀通過　保守黨雖反對終告失敗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：英下院今日二讀通過政府之經濟緊急措施法案。事先邱吉爾曾發表演說，抨擊此項法案，邱氏謂：「政府提出此案，不啻獲得空白支票，隨心所　，各部長可以極權資應，獨斷獨行。此稱方案是否為人民生活與國家僅興之所必須者？余以為此實違反英國之自由與和平時期之生活方式：反對黨均二黨政府無信任」云。此在政府方面，則堅稱：爲應付目前危機，此案之通過，實爲必要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦八日電〕下院今日二讀通過政府緊急經濟捎施法案。企圖推翻　　　議則以一四八票對二五一票被否決。政府希望能在下星期三國會休會以前，完成其餘　　程序。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕保守黨總裁邱吉爾今夜向下院提出缺席動議，要求否決政府經濟緊急措施方案，全國震驚，議會辯諭局勢嚴重已達極點。邱氏稱：「就余所見，此案實賦予政府以極權，俾可濫用取自苦幹人民囊中之全部金錢」。邱氏原擬在本年十月復會以前不參加國會辯論，現定明日抱病出席，親自發表演說，抨擊政府。國會已將暑假自明日延至下星三開始，俾有充分時間通過政府方案。據保守黨發言人稱：鑒於邱氏態度，該黨將堅決反對，但因工黨議員佔多數，一部份左派份子，雖加責難，其能通過，殆無疑義。保守黨代理總裁艾登則批評該案爲率爾操觚，既欠斟酌，又不完備，並謂政府所要求吾人考慮者非政策而係希望。同時，財長道爾頓在下院宣稱，今年底軍隊員額將裁减爲八十七萬名。</p>
<p>〔合眾社偷敦七日電〕英國財相適爾頓頃宣稱：美國貸予英國之借款，至十月間即將用罄，故應立即停止以現款購買糧食云。</p>
<h3>英將請求美國給予積極援助　放寬借款協定條件尙嫌不足</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕此間負責方面稱：在下次英美討論經濟危機之曾議中，英國將要求美國給予積極的援助，僅持消極地放寬英美借款協定之條件，不足以應付英國而臨之危機。茲有兩點，可以加以申述（一）假定美國再事向英貸款爲不可能，但若美國財政部同意保留英鎊外匯，則亦可達到與再度貸款相同之目的，果爾，則紐約銀行所握之英鎊，可以劃給美國財政部而不必交由英格蘭銀行駐紐約之代表易爲美元，致使英國枯竭之美元亦底再趨减少（問加拿大已表示準備接受英鎊，惟必須美國有所行動始可。）惟美國財政部收購紐約各銀行所持英鎊所需之款項，恐尙須國會之批准。</p>
<p>（二）美若願請國際貨幣基會宣布美元為稀少貨幣，則於宣布後，英國即可免除履行借款協定中不得歧視及必須以英鎊外匯轉爲美元等兩款之義務，英格蘭議行祗須令其駐紐約代表不再核准紐約銀行所持之英鎊易取美元即可，但此一方法並不足以解決問題。紐約銀行所持之剩餘英鎊，若美國財政部不同意收購，則其價值必將低落，將爲事實上之英鎊貶值，此同華盛頓及偷教所不欲者也。</p>
<h3>澳政府聲援　英經濟緊急措施</h3>

<h3>印荷爭端勢將再陷僵局　荷不願國際仲裁　印尼接受美澳共同調處</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖八日電〕荷政府傳已準備拒絕强迫仲裁印尼糾紛之任何方案。據消息靈通方面稱，荷政府同意接受美國居間斡旋，協助解決印尼問題，亦不反對聯合國委員團監督休戰，但不願接受聯合國委員團之調解或仲裁。安理會已將印尼問題暫擱，至星期二下午再行討論，俾各代表有機會研究印尼政府所提設立仲裁委員會之新建議。荷蘭方面之意見，即於此時發表。</p>
<p>據印尼政府通知安理會，一方而尤接受美國斡旋，一方面則請美國勸誘荷蘭及安理會同意設立仲裁機構。安理會中現尚未有設立仲裁委員會之正式提議，惟日內必將有人提出，可以斷言。傳澳代表正在考慮此一計劃，但稱尚未決定行動，將先探知其他代表與荷蘭政府之態度。同時擬向安理會建議派遺聯合國委員團或正式視察員監督兩年停戰。此項方案將在下星期二開會前分送各國代表。</p>

<h3>英法外長今秋將赴華府　商馬卿計劃細則　美援歐法案明年三月可望成立</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕此間負責觀察家相信，英外相貝文，法外長皮杜爾今秋將在華盛頓與馬歇爾國務卿親自討論「馬歇爾計劃」之細則，以便向向美國會提出。英法外長於九月問大約均將親自來絲約出席聯合國全體大會，屆時馬歇爾國務卿殆將邀彼等來華盛頓從事討論。今美國國會已在休會期間，故在今後兩日內，美國方面就馬歇爾計劃當不致有積極之活動，惟杜魯門總統所任命以研究美國兩內經濟及資源之各委員會，則將繼續開會，其報告　約可　巴黎十六國會議之報告　在同一時間得出，而國務院決策委員會研究歐洲復興需要之報告，亦可於九月中旬完成。美政府於接獲此一報告醫後，將先自行研究，然後徵求歐洲關係國家之意見。貝文皮杜爾之來美國，正可參加此項工作。馬歇爾及其助手，雖在國會休會期間，仍與國會有勢力人士保持經常接觸，蓋馬卿深願在國會就援歐計劃舉行辯論之前，先能與議會重要人物取得若干連擊，向國會提出之立法草案預料於十一月間即可完成，彼時參議院外交委員會將就該案開始委員會階段之審查。除杜魯門總統外，內開要員若馬歇爾本人，財長史奈德，商長哈立曼·農長安特森·內長克魯格等，均將向外委會提出證辭，而工農金融各界以及工會領袖亦均將被邀陳述意見。此一委員會審查程序歷時預料爲六星期，彼時當已爲十二月間。如在聖誕休假前尚有時間，則眾院外交委員會當繼之開始類似之程序。國會於明年一月之第一星期，即將復會，彼時報　法案以及委員會之審查報告，即可被列爲參議院辯論之第一項議程。眾議院中反對份子較多，故料參議院若能在兩星期內結束辯論，則眾議院至少當需四至六星期之時間，以完成該案之辯論，故此一援歐法案，最早可望在三月開始以前，完成立法手續。</p>

<h3>華南鉅額走私</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風三日廣州訊</p>
<p>華南走私的猖獗，早是全國皆知的事實；因爲有了香港澳門這兩個地方，廣州便成了私貨吐納的總匯，所以在這裏發生走私案，不管它是數千萬元，甚至三數億元也好，都有如「家常便飯」，不足爲奇。祗有這次粵海關破獲穗港綫</p>
<p>佛山輸走私案</p>
<p>却不由人不加以注視，因爲這次走私貨額之鉅，誠屬駭人聽　，而且還是粵海關有史以來緝私鉅，額的空前紀錄。</p>
<p>這案子的破獲是在七月二十五日，佛山輪是當日晨由香港駛來廣州；但在前一天，海關早已接獲綫報，說該輸夾藏有大量私貨企圖瞞稅入口，海關便於廿五日晨，派出緝私人員率同憲兵乘輪開赴黃埔外鐵門，登該輪照常例搜查私貨，並晴中監視輪上藏私部份；至七時許，該輪已駛抵市內，海關再加派人員登輪搜查，惟四週均未發覺有任何私貨。其後關員在按報位置搜查，果在該輪機房內船身次板內，及煤倉煤堆中，搜出私貨一百零八件（每件發體約九十立方公尺）；當日下午又接獲綫報，謂尙有若干私貨仍藏匿輪上，海關遂再派人搜查，果又搜出同等私貨八十五大包另十三小件，計共一百九十三大件另十三小件，這裏面包括有人參，鹿茸，名貴中西藥，汽車零件，洋皮，玻璃紙，”。顏料，糖精等貴重物品，重達三萬餘斤，約値港幣三十餘萬元，合現値國幣約二十億元，當時海關員警及憲兵等，遂將合批私貨押回海關處理。</p>
<p>事悄發生後，駐穗的憲兵廿六團，即派員會同關員前往查詢該輪船主紐頓，機長阿臣（兩人皆英籍），惟據稱：渠等對此次走私，全不知情，實由機房內</p>
<p>工人暗中包運</p>
<p>並謂：該輪機房工人於事發後，已有五人潛逃云云。而海關方面，亦於當晚向該船主提出書面詢問，該船主覆文稱：該項私貨可能係廿三或廿四日，在香港時有人偷運落船者。這答覆當然是有意推卸責任吧了，因爲這私貨的體積如此龐大，數目如此衆多，從岸上搬運下船，再匿藏在船身夾板內及煤倉之煤堆中，必需相當時間，亦必不能掩一般人員耳目，倘非有船上的高級人員包庇，焉能致此？而且據當局的調查：該儲藏私貨的暗倉，似是特別製浩的，其倉門用鐵門封閉，再加以固定螺絲，技術極其巧妙（如圖），所以從這推測，可能是</p>
<p>有計劃的走私　行爲，該船主推不知情，顯為狡卸，現憲兵與海關方面，已將經過呈報行轅，除嚴責該船主交出潛逃五名工人及主犯外，並勒令停航，該輪現仍被扣在廣州白餓潭河面。</p>
<p>至行轅方面，對這案異常重視；記者曾訪鄧副主任能光，據稱：此爲華南走私鉅案，中樞對華南走私問題，早已認爲影響全國經濟，素，根絕決心，故行轅對此案特別注意，曾派員前往該輪將所有暗藏設備及私貨一大批，逐一攝影存案，同時並已專案呈報中央，請示辦法。鄧氏並謂：該輪與前次走私的武穴輸，同是太古公司的船隻，該公司對前次武穴船因走私被罰的款項，迄今仍未履行，而現在該公司的佛山輪又大批走私，這說不是該船上人員有計劃的行爲，誰能置信呢？</p>
<p>至於太古公司方面，則現在還沒有什麼表示。</p>
<p>這案發生後，街頭巷尾不少當作談話的資料；有人竟道樣說：這次的私貨値港幣三十萬元，連零星走私未查出的，當在四十萬元以上，這已等於美金九萬三千多元，和輸管會本季核准輸入廣州十萬美元的限額，不是相差無幾嗎？這話自然有點諷刺，但也足提供給當局參考的，如果走私不能杜絕，那輸入限制不是等於虛設嗎？</p>
<h3>鈾！廣西產量豐富精純　科學家將出發開採　轟鑿原子核之儀器已向美國訂購</h3>
<p>〔桂光社訊〕鈾鑛爲製造原子彈之基本原料，若干世界科學家費盡心血，始獲研究成功，惟此種礦物，產量極少，全世界產鈾地區，現僅有美國科羅拉多，烏台，比屬剛果甘他果，加拿大大熊湖，英國康禾爾，馬達加斯加等處，及蘇聯南澳洲，捷克，葡萄牙谷有少許出產，故研究實騐，極爲困難。民國三十二年五月，我國地質學家南延宗到廣西調查錫鑛，在鍾山紅花區黃羌坪發現此種鈾鑛，將標本帶回中央研究院地質研究所，由地質學家吳磊伯用微量化學分析試騐證明，確屬精純鈾鑛。去年資源委員會鑛產測勘處會同中央地質調查所，派地質學家到桂詳訓查勘，查得黃羌坪鑛區附近，均爲花崗岩構成，其後又有長英岩侵入，長英岩又被偉晶花崗岩穿鑿，鈾鑛便順着長英岩的扭轉面生長，含鈾鑛物已經　定的：有瀝靑鈾，金釠酸鉀鈾，銅鈾，雲母，鈣鈾雲母‘鈾鋁鑛五種，不僅儲量豐富，且含質亦極精純，遠較東北海城，綏遠五原沙門天，集寗魚心　，東北毛頭鎭等處所發現之鈾鑛爲優。茲聞關係方面，以此種鈾鑛，極爲難得，無論在科學上，國防上，工業上，及人類幸福上，均應努力研究，迎頭趕上，爲我國科學界放一異彩，現已決定聘請科學界權威多人，赴廣西從事開發，以供實騐，現正積極籌備，一俟準備完畢，即行出發。至轟　原子核之儀器，業經向美國定購，最近期內，可以經港運桂。（八日）</p>

<h3>香港小姐　鬧離婚　口頭哭訴以外發表書面談話</h3>
<p>〔本報特約記者程志政五日香港訊〕千呼萬呼始出來的「香港小姐」吳丹鳳，在當選的那晚，中英影片公司就和她簽了合同，担任某片的女主角，於是「香港小姐」一躍而爲「電影明星」了！廣播電台接着聘請她担任時代歌曲的特別廣播，廣吿上少不得又添上了「歌后」的榮街。一時來風送朦王閣，」吳丹鳳一登龍門之後，立刻平步靑雲，成爲香港「最你大的女性」，請她剪綵的，請她題名的，請她吃飯的，請她攝影的，忙得她不可開交。</p>
<p>並非小姐實是「香港太太」</p>
<p>語云：物極必反，樂極生悲，最近這位「香港小姐」，忽然又成被攻擊的目標，原來這位「小姐」，部早已嫁過人，而且已生過一子一女了！這位冒牌的「小姐」，自然給熱烈捧塲的人們，一頓掃興，「香港小姐」一變而爲「香港太太」，豈不滑稽可笑，這個秘密拆穿之後，「香港小姐」的風頭，也就不像以前那麼健了。</p>
<p>煮鶴焚琴　丈夫竟大施拳脚</p>
<p>以情理而論，做「香港小姐」的丈夫，是何等光榮的一件事，可是吳的丈夫區錫元，却認爲「香港小姐」帶給了他無限的侮辱，那次吳去參加競選，區在澳門，事前是瞞着他的。後來區在澳門看到香港報，知道了這個消息，急忙趕到香港，大加責駡，言語衝突之後，區又大施拳脚，並監視吳的行動，不准越雷池一步，八月一日夫婦間又起衝突，「香港小姐」嬌小柔弱，如何敵得過丈夫的兇暴，結果被毆得遍體瘀黑，婉轉嬌啼，如同梨花帶雨，煮鶴焚琴，區先生未免太煞風景了。</p>
<p>進行離婚　發表「書面談話」</p>
<p>「香港小姐」在一頓通毆之後，走到胞兄吳邦家裏暫住，一面進行控訴，正式提出離婚，記者們去訪問吳丹鳳時，看見地玉臂傷痕累累，熟淚盈睫，都十分同情她不幸的遭遇。她除了口頭哭訴丈夫的虐待以外，幷且發表一段「書面談話」如下：</p>
<p>「十數年來的積憤和生命上的悲哀，今天稍爲發洩一點出來，我要和他離婚，使意見不同的怨耦，在離婚之後，雙方都得到一條新生之路，似如我再忍受下去，常常給他打駡，和任意摧殘，這對於我的前程和幸福，部遭受到莫大的阻礙和損害。他的態度實在暴燥，而且變本加厲了。但我最後聲明，關於離婚的理由，幷不是我在獲選了「香港小姐」後的動機，而實在是迫不得已的，希望社會人士明瞭此事的眞相。」</p>
<p>離婚以後，吳丹鳳便是「名實相符」的「香港小姐」了。</p>

<h3>巴川正和兩銀行同時倒閉　共缺頭寸六十八億　與香港正和停業有連帶關係</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市南京路二〇五號正和銀行，及同路七三一號巴川銀行，昨以在票據交換所欠缺頭寸，未能及時彌補，當由該所通函停止交換。</p>
<p>按正和及巴川兩銀行，在票據交換所，均列爲代理交換行莊。交換行莊號碼，正和爲二一一號，巴川爲一五〇號。七日在該所交換票據結果，芷和軋欠廿七億元，巴川軋欠四十一億元，按照該所規定，須於當晚八時半前彌補平衡。後雖經通融展延至昨晨九時十分，</p>
<p>兩行迄未能設法彌補，該所當即通函各交換行莊，自即日（八日）起，停止該行票據交換。迄昨日下午四時半，兩行仍彌補無方，該所當即將停止兩行交換經過情形，電陳財政部備案。</p>
<p>據悉：該兩銀行此次週轉不靈，實與香港正和銀行於六日之突吿停業，直接相關。按該兩銀行之現任董事長，俱係彭秉澄，彭氏復兼任遠洋貿易公司董事長。聞最近遠洋公司在外洋運到大批　餘物資，到埠後價呆滯銷，因此而呆擱之資金，已達數十億元。再加香港正和銀行業務失策，遠洋公司在暹汕分公司又有倒閉之說，提有之風驟起，遂遭全部牽入漩渦。</p>
<p>經營方針素欠健全</p>
<p>據中央銀行某主管處負責人語記者：該兩銀行曾迭經財部會同國行檔核人員檢查帳册，發現放款業務太濫，經營方針不健全。每晚在票據交換所頭寸經當軋出，事後須融解進大量現鈔彌補，故已迭予警吿。所幸該兩銀行營業不穩情事，同業中早已風聞，故事前咸審愼防範，停止交換後，與同業並無影響、現查該兩銀行在國行之存款準備金，共約四億餘元。而兩行存款總額，約在卅五億元以上，相抵尙欠卅一億餘元。又該兩行帳面上債權債務相抵，尙欠廿餘億元。拖欠數額不鉅，可望督促於短期內淸理了結。</p>
<p>據該負責人觀測：兩行之善後問題：照經濟緊急措施方案辦理，兩行在本市雖稱分行，惟以業務車心在滬關係，按例均應予以吊銷執照處分。惟正和銀行一說總行在香港註册，則或將另案辦理云。</p>
<p>董事長均為彭秉澄</p>
<p>按正和銀行成立於民卅一年間。卅五年十二月六目，在滬設分行。總行設廣州，一說設香港，廣州爲總管理處。此外在重慶，昆明，梧州等處，亦設有分行，康定有辦事處。資本三億元，董事長彭秉澄，自兼總經理，上海分行經理爲竇嘵東。</p>
<p>巴川銀行於民廿九年十一月，在四川銅梁正式成立。卅五年三月十四日，在滬設分行。並先後在天津，漢口，四川太和鎭，合川，設分支行。又在綿陽，遂寗，潼南，設辦事處。實收資本七千萬元，董事長亦亦彭秉澱，總經理劉希文，上海分行經理顧季文。</p>
<p>至與該兩銀行有關之遠洋貿易公司，董事長亦係彭秉澄。該公司業務重心在香港，並在暹羅，銀行界忽有兩家宣吿不穩，塲外忽吿解貨者多，息價開高，對敲大戶頗多在市塲套賣即交永紗者，終於由堅轉疲。新亞在不良傳說中，曾告跌停，場內交易不多，大勢不脫徘徊。</p>
<p>晨開稍高，開後遞永紗彼拉高至二三七元，即交亦達二三一元高價，於二二三號等紛紛脫手，盤低至二二八元。八號三一號二一八號雖進，回升殊微。十時後二〇七號三二號一七四號一六三號九七號賣出，二二六號並力售現永紗，十時半场外息價開高正一角六分半及二角一，曾迫低至二二五元及二二二元低價，六五號二二四號二一八號二二三號趁低買進，會回升至二三一元。一四號一八三號等供售，一六二號一六〇號一七三號再售永紗現貨，二二六號之供給不斷，永紗午收遞交以二二七元，即交則低至二二〇元結束。收後遞永紗喊價稍低，次熱各股形勢尙形平穩，新亞跌停後有回，結果較前收計即交股永紗美亞新光景福中法新華微降，勤興跌半成，華豐微升，新亞內衣各跌半成，永公國貨火柴統益均平，水泥景綸微升，餘股咸吿微降。遞交股計永公華豐微升，永紗美亞新光景福勤興微降，塲外各老股計閘北華商南洋下挫，而大生繼續趨升。證交市塲昨揭示略云，據永安新加城，巴達維亞，均設有分公司。該公司本市分公司，即設本市南京路二〇五號正和銀行三樓。近方在報章刋載大幅廣吿，出售大此剩餘物資示。</p>
<h3>場外息價開高　華股由堅轉疲</h3>
<p>華股昨漲後仍疲，永紗以三分之一並不上市流通，市塲已有公吿，人心不無誤解，上場見悄，終以銀行界忽有兩家宣告不穩，塲外忽告解貨者多，息價開高，對敲大戶頗多在市塲套賣即交永紗者，終於由堅轉疲。新亞在不良傳說中，會告跌停，塲內交易不多，大勢不脫徘徊。</p>
<p>晨開稍高，開後遞永紗被拉高至二三七元，即交亦達二三一元高價，於二二三號等紛紛脫手，盤低至二二八元。八號三一號二一八事情雖進，回升殊微。十時二〇七號三二號一七四號一六三號九七號賣出，二二六號並力售現永紗，十時半塲外息價開高至一角六分半及二角一，曾迫低至二二五元及二二二元低價，六五號二二四號二一八號二二一號趁低買進，曾回升至二三一元。一四號一八三號等供售，一六二號一六〇號一七三號再售永紗現貨，二二六號之供給不斷，永紗午收遞交以二二七元，即交則低至二二〇元結束。收後遞永紗喊價稍低，次熱各股形勢尙形平穩，新亞跌停後有回，結果較前收計即交股永紗美亞新光景福中法新華微降，勤興跌半成，華豐微升，新亞內衣各跌半成，永公國貨火柴統益均平，水泥景綸微升，餘股咸告微降。遞交股計永公華豐微升，永紗美亞新光景福勤與微降，塲外各老股計閘北華商南洋下挫，而大生繼續趨升。</p>
<h3>永紗增資新股一部份不上市</h3>
<p>證交市場昨揭示略云，據永安紡織股份有限公司函報，第五次增資收據三〇〇〇〇一號至三〇〇一〇七號，共計二十億股，並不上市流通。</p>
<h3>統債再見俏利　外股賣氣轉盛</h3>
<p>公債昨再現俏利，求戶紛起，縱有潮帮中人若大成興等獲利了結，三六〇室出後即進，五五五室五〇三室五五二室爭買，統丙自晨開一二一〇〇元起，步漲到一四三〇〇元左右收市。雜牌漲勢較差，成交增至七八百萬，結果較前收計甲乙升一千元，丙漲二千五，丁戊亦好一千一。</p>
<p>外股昨賣氣轉盛，匯水助賣，洋行帮及銀行帮俱賣，廣帮進後亦出，證券帮獨進，亦難支持。怡紗晨開八四五〇〇元，金融風潮影響，了結者多，退至八二〇〇〇元結束。較之前收計英聯會德豐紙業怡嗶鋼業微降，業廣電話雖平，怡紗航業則跌半成左右</p>
<h3>食米起伏狹隘　新粳到多價下跌</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共計到貨米糧六千二百餘石，南市早晨開盤，依然續疲萬元，午時店方納胃加强，頓形轉定。結果粳米挫落有限，早薄稻亦然相仿。秈米大多定勢，白陰元亦少變化，惟新粳則來貨湧旺，消化不動，狂跌一二萬元。北市粳秈仍趨軟化，新粳猛落二三萬元，白陰元亦少出入</p>
<p>麵粉店方進胃不爽，再低一二千元，雜牌粉供源尙多，暫難向榮。麩皮鄕銷不動，疲而不酗，豆餅已成冷落，步削三四千元。黃豆到銷兩平，市勢站立。新豆消化尙可，形勢活靈。丹陽新靑豆，初次到申，身骨尙軟。　豆萎　乏神，中次再挫三五千元。蠶豆零化尙股，客帮略取，績見挺升二三千元。赤豆堅定，莞豆貨稀俏利，苞米漲定之格，紅糧供求兩不見旺，市面平庸。芝蔴交淡平疲，生仁南洋見懈，回該一二萬元。小麥仍無變動。</p>
<p>油市兎起　落，廣幫重見暢吸，生油暴漲三四萬元，蔴油亦漲二三萬元，淸油豆油隨之跟漲萬元，菜油則本街消化不振，仍然平正。</p>
<h3>洋米到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕福來公司新輪印度怡美利號，昨晨抵滬，由仰光運來洋米三千五百噸。又自新加坡運來　六十五捆，檀香一百四十五件，現泊四號五號浮筒起卸。又悉：招商屬海辰輪，已於本月四日抵達仰光，聞將裝米穴千噸來滬，現正裝載中，約下星期中，可以裝竣返滬。</p>
<h3>對人造絲每週配價　中信局採機動方式　絲織業定明日開會員大會</h3>
<p>中信局人造絲配價問題，絲織業尙在繼續呼籲中。中信局方面仍聽上峯之指示，惟目前無任何跡象可以變更配價。據該局負責人談：該局配價決每週調整一次，價絡之訂定，係以過去價格爲標準。去年開配之初，其配價即與黑市接近，當時如金三馬配價爲二百七十八萬，而黑市爲三百三十萬。其後以政院公文往返需時，以致配價與黑市有相反之距離，今後當採機動方式，以應付市塲之演變。如下週黑市降低，配價自可更動，此次照市價减低百分之十，實爲合理云。</p>
<p>又訊：絲織業因要求减低配售人絲價，不得要領，昨日下午又在該公會內召開小組會議決議連合各廠具函同業公會，即日召開大會，俾全體會員表決意見。聞已定於星期日（十日）上午八時半，假座商會內召開會員大會云。</p>
<h3>配價過低亦不相宜</h3>
<p>又訊：昨據中信局長吳任傖氏表示，最近人造絲黑市仍在二千四百萬左右盤旋，該局存絲六千箱，不敷市塲需要，如配價通低，適足以便利廠商藉此圖利，社局吳局長所提意見，僅以提高百分五十爲限，即每箱配價一三五〇萬元，實屬過低，該局現正商討中。配價將較上期九〇〇萬元提高約百分之一百，決定日期常在不遠云。</p>
<h3>中信局收購箱茶　按標準價先付六成　祁紅每擔價格七十二萬元</h3>
<p>卅五年度箱茶，茶商向中信局申請收購以後因各種茶葉品級尙在鑑定中，該信局爲顧念茶商之羽難，特按議定之標準茶價，每担先付價款六成，其餘四成，俟各種品級鑑定後，再行結付。祁紅標準價格每担爲七十二萬，屯綠九十萬，平綠四十八萬，各先按六成給付。</p>
<p>又訊：內銷茶與外銷茶，自買氣趨縮以來，市勢已不若前數日之活躍，成交數量，亦頻頻减低。以言脚地，尙屬穩固，良以執貨者鑒於市上存底，並不豐厚，售意咸帶堅化。又悉：無錫一帶，目論對於低檔紅茶，續有悅胃，淮企圖抑便進取，致米成交。</p>
<h3>棉紗價再挫落</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開以織廠略有收吸，行悄曾一度喊俏，旋因紡調會議價减低，紡難公司開售籌碼充沛，市塲人心益形萎靡，市氣頓吿不支。迨至最後，四二支藍鳳紗比上日同跌二十萬元，爲一千六百四十五萬元。三十二支藍鳳猛挫七十五萬，爲一千三百十萬元。二十支特雙馬亦小三十五萬，爲一千一百七十五萬元。輕雙馬爲一千零二十萬元，軋小十五萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均軋低一二十萬至三五十萬元不一。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售五八五件，由購廠商共一七九戶。</p>
<h3>白報紙下挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美加拿大對開白報紙四千餘噸，將於本月十七日輸遝抵滬，故連日白報紙，市價下挫。</p>

<h3>歪曲的理論</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>在偶然的醫師集會中聽見了有些人主張在量的方面大大地擴充醫師的人數。不管它是正式醫校畢業的也好，抑或是看護士出身也好，醫院侍役出身也好，只要它能取得政府所發給的執照就行。因爲在可憐的中國國度裏眞不知要在幾萬人中才能够尋得一位西醫。我們在內地跑跑，也許到處可以買着香烟，但是，那末最起碼的阿司匹靈或八卦丹頭痛粉之類却難買到，至於所謂西醫以及藥房之類那是更加不用想了。所以爲求實利方面起見最好還是在短期內大量地產生出醫師，而不必過事吹求於質的方面，因爲不管怎樣，「有」終究比「沒有」好哩。」</p>
<p>不錯，這種論調說來眞是娓娓中聽。我們檢討目前中國醫界的狀况，當然要十二萬分地贊成這種論調。可是，有兩點我們應該注意，我們不能不提出來供給大家討論：</p>
<p>（一）發言人面對着現實的需要主張在量的方面大大地擴充醫師的人數，這是不可否認的好理論。可是發言人忘記了他自己的身份，拋棄了他自己的權益以及和他同一陣綫的醫師了。因爲組織公會的「目的」無非是藉公會的力量來維護會內全體會員的權益而已，現在發言人只想到國內缺乏醫事人才而主張大量地產生醫師，却忘記了他自己並不是官，忘記了地自己只不過是醫師公會會員推選出來一位公僕。目前的上海已經擠滿了許多醫師，生意好的當然不少，可是生意不好的更多。假使以後再要將尺寸寬放，產生了許多醫師，而又擠滿在上海不肯他去，那豈不直接地妨害了會員自已的權益嗎？老實說一句：有許多會員也正在怨天怨地呢。</p>
<p>（二）「量」的擴大與「質」的充實究竟孰利孰弊，我們不是負責醫政的當局，我們不便發言，我只希望大家注意</p>
<p>一下過去數十年來沒有西醫以剪的歷史，那末我們就可以曉得量的擴充也不見得能成其理由吧！</p>
<p>好！假使發言人沒有忘記他自已的地位，假使發言人曉得要維護醫師公會會員的權益，假使他沒有別的企圖，那末這種歪曲的理論今後應該少發表。</p>
<h3>請投考醫校之學生注意（上）</h3>
<p>— 阮尙丞</p>
<p>政府鼓勵學生習外國語之目的是「求知」。但是演變到如今，除求知之外更發生了其他更重要之作用，尤其是在吾們醫學界一，凡吾投考醫學院之學生宜注意焉。</p>
<p>歐洲大陸上在十九世紀中執掌衛生行政者，幾全是法律專家，後來醫政大種漸漸轉入了習醫者之手，至近來在英語國家則更進一步，以習公共衛生學者方能主特衛生行政，是與大陸國家相比，至今仍有異曲同工之處。</p>
<p>我國各類學術界不論所習的是那一種外國語，雖不無派別之分，然尙能通融合作，惟吾醫界則逈異，當然有其原因所在。茲擇其大者言之：（一）習英語之醫學人員較習其他外國語言者爲多。（二）中國自有新醫以來英語國家以傳敎與傳醫並進，從前病家欲受西法療治者非入敎會醫院不可，而英美新教敎會之在中國較舊敎更爲普遍，於是到處均設醫院或醫學院，國人之習醫者幾大都習英語（習法語德語者極少）且到處可得實習與深造之機會。英美國家來中國設工廠或工業學校者，遠不如醫院醫學院之多，所以　人之習其他科目者，其實習等事即不及醫學之方便。（三）英語系醫院內爲方面外國人起見，日常一切當然盡用英語，而國人之習醫者在病人前討論病情時，爲避免病人之煩惱，使其不知病狀之危險，於是均以英語交談。更以中文之醫學名詞尙未審定，用外國語談話比說中國語方便，年深月久之後每日很少用着說中國語之機會。於是在日常生活中，不論應酬也，演講也，甚至函件公文也，無往而非英文矣。又以外人所辦之學校以中文爲不重要之科目，於是中文之應用，與中文之美妙處，非盡人能知矣。（四）吾國自革命成功而有衛生行政以來，在醫學上每受英語國家之大量津貼，衛生行政方式當然也跟上了英語國家之同一路綫。習公共衛生者更得執黨衛生行政。在這種趨勢之下，不免有受人支配之處，但政府爲目前利益起見，豈有不走順路之理。甚至祗解英語而不識中國字不能講中國話者亦可執醫事大權，而社會不以爲怪。且觀勝利之後以通日語者管理日僑，以通德語者管理德僑，是爲必然之理，亦即走順路也。決無以習俄文者去管理日僑而自取麻煩也。</p>
<h3>日光與健康（下）</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>第八，對於塵埃的關係：在塵埃中的生活病原體，受日光强烈的照射，可以殺滅，而减除因塵埃飛揚而傳播疾病的危險。</p>
<p>上面幾點，顯示日光與人生的關係，與健康生活的密不可分，但是，日光對於人類的身體，究竟有利亦或有害，這一點是應該加以探討的，我們知道日光主要的來源是太陽光，因光波的長短不同，而分紫外綫與紅外綫，日常所見的光波，爲光波中的一部份，現在按光波的不同，而敍其對健康的影響：</p>
<p>（一）光綫：日常的工作都是藉着光綫來完成，光綫太弱及光綫太强，健康均發生阻碍，因光綫主要的功能是照射工作，此乃直接關係，間接因光綫照射入入體，人可吸收光綫，轉綫成熱，故人體有一部份熟，由外來光綫而得到，作爲身體機能的動能，如造血，新陳代謝等，若在黑暗處工作長久，則可以漸次衰弱，貧血，感染肺癆等常見，光綫與眼的關係至大，若光綫過弱，則易成近視，因眼肌拉長，而不能收縮，亦有因光綫過弱而發生眼球震蕩症，此因眼肌疲倦，幅輳失調，而不能集中，視物若有二體，完全不能固定，若光綫過强，對眼的障碍較少，惟在强光下長久工作，可以刺戟眼睛疲倦，變成近視，亦可特殊引起夜盲症，暗點症等均爲光綫過強所致，保護方法爲戴有色眼鏡，不在過弱或過强的光綫下長久工作，能設法調節光度自然更好。</p>
<p>（二）紫外綫　紫外綫對加菌有强烈的致死力，對人體訓胞亦右破壞力，若長時照射，可變成紅，痛，水泡等症候，但身體有吸收紫外光的作用，皮膚皮層雖然受損，而不能侵入深層，破壞體腔組織，同時，身體有色素沉着的保護作用，晒太陽以後，皮膚變異，保護皮膚不再爲紫外綫破壞，並可吸收紫外綫轉燮成熱，而輸送入身體，刺戟各部分的機能，紫外綫對眼的刺戟作用外，許多職業病，如影電，人工太陽證工作者，受紫外光刺戟，使眼發炎，結膜眼周圍，眼簾均發紅，腫而且痛，有致角膜變成溷混狀，若再厲害可使水晶體凝固，而成白內障，載用褐色，黃色，黑色眼睛，可以吸收紫外綫而保護眼睛。</p>
<p>紫外綫對身體亦有利益，如佝僂病，骨發育不良，骨狀變化，軟骨，多爲丁種維生素缺乏，致使鈣，磷代謝發生障礙而成，此由食物中丁種維生素供給缺乏，但由紫外綫照射亦可獲得足量的本種維生素，因爲在身體中有Chalesterin存在皮膚下，經過紫外綫射照後，即可以轉換爲丁種維生素，因此，多曬太陽可以補充食物中丁種維生素供給的不足，並可以防止骨骼的發育不良。</p>
<p>（三）紅外綫　紅外綫本身有熱，能侵入人體深層，此與光波長短有關，短光波易吸收，長光波的紅外綫則可以侵入皮膚幾公分，刺戴生理機能，所以在不適宜的情形下，夏天有許多人中署（由紅外綫透入腦部，腦受熱發昏）所以夏天在日光下工作，宜戴白帽，且不要工作時間太長，另外，眼睛長久經紅外綫照射過度，亦可以發生白內障與暗點症，此多爲生火工作者，或玻璃工人等，若戴藍色，綠色鏡子，可以吸收紅外綫，而避免由紅外綫而誘發的疾病。</p>
<p>在我們的生活中，無時無刻不接觸日光，也無時無刻不需要日光，所以關於日光的衛生，我們便不能不注意了，我們應常在日光下運動，多行日光浴，房屋內應該使日光充分的直接照射，每日將窗戶打開，使日光直射入房內，殺滅微生物，住地最好不在低窪的地方，同時四周應有充分接受日光照射的機會，工作時應有適當的光綫，不可使光綫過弱，或者過強，抖動，均有損目力，若享受過度的日光，應顧到年齡的大小而去正確的應用，以免毀傷組織細胞，夏日在空曠操作或行路時，要戴通風的帽子，使日光不能直射頭部，行日光洛時，自然要將頭部遮蓋，時間更不能過長，這許多事體都需待留心，雖然，日光有益於人生，但應用不得法，亦會遭受其害！</p>
<h3>瘦的兒童可以變胖嗎？</h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>「瘦」的毛病在兒童中比較常見。一般的說，「瘦」就是營養不良。這有一部份是體質的關係，光天性的或是遺傳性的。自然也有時是有一種全身病，消瘦則不過是病狀之一。有的小孩子生來就很瘦弱，或是先天不足。多半他們的父母就是體質薄弱發育不全的，或者有癆病或是梅毒</p>
<p>兒童中的營養不良，還是後天性的居多數。主要的原因是輕忽了日常生活的衛生法則，或是根本就不懂得。這自然是做父母的過錯。最重要的原因，是飲食不當。吃的東西也許是不足，也許是不適於兒童的消化力，也許是缺少令兒童生長的質料，例如有很多的父母是讓他們的孩子多吃肉，麵，糖菓等類的東西。其實要兒童發育正常，應當减少這種食品，代以牛乳，靑菜，水菓，五穀等　食。吃零食，特別是糖和其他甜的東西，最能引起消一化不良以至於成了營養不足的現象。飲食無定時，以及咀嚼不足等都是營養不良的重要原因。</p>
<p>一日三餐對於多數的兒童是很合宜的，有時於兩餐中間再加一次點心，如熱湯或牛乳，麵包或饅頭乾抹牛奶油，但不可過多。兒童較多負擔甚衆的家庭，如經濟力量不足，則可用豆漿代替牛乳，無論如何在兒童生長發育的過程中，蛋白質一定要供給够</p>
<p>好動是兒童的天性，正常的活動對於兒童的身心都有很大的裨益。但是劇烈的運動必須禁止，白天須有相當的休息。日中或午後要睡一二小時。夜晚必須早寢，有些做父母的往往因爲鄕天，又麻雀等延至深夜還不睡覺，兒童在旁邊聽，在旁邊看，慢慢也養成了遲睡宴起的壞習慣，而影響兒童身心的健康莫此爲甚，做父母的一定要注意改正。</p>
<p>此外流動的新鮮空氣，與戶外的陽光也是必需的。</p>
<p>遇有喉門之扁桃腺樣　　大或發炎時，應除去之。若有　齒，亦常修補或拔除之。無論發見兒童身體有何缺點或畸形，皆當立時予以矯治之。</p>
<p>做父母的倘在上述的幾點加以注意和改善，那末他們的小孩就一定不會瘦了。</p>

<h3>花之什</h3>
<p>— 鏗鏘</p>
<p>溫室裏的花</p>
<p>溫室裏的花開放了，我看到那是花匠硬生生剝開它的。雖然花朶依舊像平常那末大小，但它的成長畢竟是畸形的。</p>
<p>它的枝幹柔軟而彎曲，像剛學會走路的孩子的腿。它的顏色也很古怪，像妓女臉上的胭脂，縱然鮮艷，刦掩蓋不了生活折磨下貧血的氣色。</p>
<p>它更有着畏懼陽光的羞恥阿，不像生長在田野的向日葵，敢光明磊落地向着太陽，它却只像新嫁娘怕見公婆的樣子，見了太陽就再也抬不起頭來。</p>
<p>溫室裏的花又凋謝了，它無聲無息地開放，也無聲無息地凋謝。是誰害它這麼悽慘的呢？懺悔的心情唯恐讓花匠的兩隻指頭知道。</p>
<p>野草花</p>
<p>曠野裏，一朶野草花倔強地開放著。</p>
<p>它沒有人工搭建的棚架扶持，也沒有一片多餘的葉子陪襯。它只靠自己細弱的莖，倔强地支持它從開放直到凋謝。</p>
<p>去年今日也有這樣的野草花的，但後來却落入了耕牛的嘴裏。誰又料到這倔强的小生物，一年後的今天居然還會再生呢？</p>
<p>曠野裏，野草花依舊倔强地開放著。它是象徽生之奮鬥呵！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這雙力小動作，一靈過去，襄外有兩隻手，同時伸出，把車門開了，裏邊是那車夫的一隻手，外面是那個招待，赶上來拉着車門。</p>
<p>「您二位由車站來？」招待冲姜耀羣和小老虎閒，只見他嘴唇動着，却是木木地，</p>
<p>「可不是？」耀羣隨着小老虎一邊下車，一邊懶懶地回答「您吩咐賬房給開發車錢罷」。</p>
<p>「是，您哪，」招待接過了小老虎手上的兩隻小包袱，「您還有大件行李？」招待的聲香也是木木的沒有一絲抑揚。「許有吧！」耀羣含含糊糊地，似乎有意讓人聽不真。</p>
<p>「請，您哪。」招待請耀羣小老虎二人先走；那客氣的動作姿式，也是木木地</p>
<p>從一個角度看，這木頭型的招待，因其木得過分，神情，語調，行動，都那麼單調，叫人感覺這雙方見面的小小接觸，</p>
<p>但從另一個角度看，他的外表雖說木木然，只是一種矜恃的表現，內裏却似乎凛森森地；這木然的成分中，含有極度的神經緊張，好像每根神經都在顫動，每個肌肉的細胞都在戰慄，同時有一種恐怖的經騐，儘量的強制着他的神經和全身肌肉，不讓跳動，因此沒有表情。</p>
<p>表情在這個「區域」裏危險性太大：言語行動稍有表情，等於把自己的秘密洩漏出來。這洩漏的後果，是不堪設想的；可能遭致三天三夜的「疲勞審問」，可能失去這奴隸式的「自由」，被人拘禁起來，三個月，一年半載，甚至十年八載；可能遭到非刑的拷打，榜掠，灌水，電刑，掛屍……</p>
<p>這個招待的行動，似乎有傳染性。耀羣本來有些矜持，一見這招待的舉動，她的矜持程序，立即加深。小老虎剛才在車中，認爲已到地頭，本來有些活動起來，但經那招待的冷氣一沖，也不覺得預備著的一股高興，立時凍結了。</p>

<h3>Report by the Deputy Minister of National Defense on Military Affairs: Shandong Battlefield Expected to End Soon; Shouguang, Juancheng, and Juye Recaptured in Succession</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The situation on the Shandong battlefield is improving. Liu Shi-yi, Deputy Minister of National Defense, stated optimistically during a briefing to the Executive Yuan this morning: The war in Shandong is expected to come to an end soon. He said that the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces, under pressure from the National Army, have been trapped in the triangular area south of the Yellow River and west of the Jinpu Railway. The Chen Yi bandit forces have also been separated from them to the east of the Jinpu Railway by the National Army. Two columns of Chen's forces attempted to cross the railway to the west to join Liu's forces, but they have been surrounded by the National Army. This situation is quite good. If there are no unexpected events, the war in Shandong is expected to conclude in the short term. Tan Boyu, the Deputy Minister of Transportation, followed Liu's report with a description of the transportation situation, stating that the Ministry of Transportation is focusing on the repair of railways and highways. Regarding the Jiaoji Railway, it has been opened several times in the past, only to be destroyed again. Therefore, the Ministry has decided to temporarily postpone repairs until the situation in Shandong becomes clear and the war comes to an end.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 8th] A major campaign to annihilate the enemy in western Shandong will resume within days. Liu Bocheng's main force and remnants of Chen Yi's main force are currently surrounded by the National Army in the area south of the Yellow River, west of the Grand Canal, and on both banks of the Songjiang River. Except for a portion that crossed the river and fled north, the remaining Communist bandits are finding it difficult to cross the river because Dongkou is firmly held by the National Army. They will be gradually annihilated in western Shandong. Furthermore, the National Army's security forces crossed the river at 5:00 AM this morning and launched a direct attack on Shouguang, overcoming resistance along the way. They recaptured Shouguang County at 9:00 AM and are currently conducting mopping-up operations in the outer areas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 8th] The left-wing corps of the National Army completely occupied Juancheng on the 7th. Another National Army unit from Hebei also formally captured Juye on the morning of the 8th and is currently attacking Yuncheng from both sides. They are also controlling important points and lines between Jiaxiang, Juye, Yuncheng, and Juancheng, closing the southern gateway of this triangular area and forcing the remaining bandits to retreat and gather in the designated area for annihilation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 8th] The National Army in Yidu is advancing north, reaching west of Shouguang City, and launching a campaign to seize the city. The National Army in Jiaoxian continues to attack Gaomi. Zichuan and Boshan are also expected to be recovered soon. The entire Jiaoji Railway line is now under the control of the National Army, and the day of its complete reopening is not far off.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Outskirts of Yulin; Three County Magistrates in Hebei Province Return to Their Posts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yulin, 8th] The Communist bandits' New 1st Brigade, Independent 4th Brigade, Teaching 2nd Brigade, 358th Brigade, 359th Brigade, and 1st Cavalry Brigade launched fierce attacks on the National Army positions on the outskirts of Yulin in the evening of the 5th. The National Army defending the area is relying on the strategically important outposts of Sanchawan, Wulita, and the high ground outside the South Gate to hold their ground, and the fighting is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 7th] More than a thousand Mongol bandits cavalry from Tumut Left Banner, located forty li northeast of Guihua in Leishenggui Village, have recently been discovered. They are suspected of attempting to invade eastern Suiyuan. The situation in Otog Banner of Yikezhao League is chaotic. Zhang Yaowu, the nephew of the late Security Commander Zhang Wenxuan, has been arrested by the traitors Ma Fugang, Ma Liangcheng, etc. Yang Senzhabu has left the banner for Ningxia. The Wangfu Guards and banner affairs are being handled on his behalf by his younger brother Zhamusenzhabu, who is deploying defenses at the Maonaohai Temple. Xue Peiyin and Qi Quanxi, dispatched by the Provincial Government and the Mongolian Political Council to Otog Banner to mediate internal disputes, have arrived at Taolijia. Currently, the bandit Wang Zhen's forces in Anbian are actively preparing to attack north and are attempting to cut off the Sui-Ning transportation route. The Ningxia army has reinforced its main forces at Niutoushan near Wuzhongbao in preparation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 8th] To coordinate with the National Army in Pingbao in clearing the Ping-Jin-Bao triangular area, the National Army west of Tianjin set out from Shengfang on the 7th and reached Shijianfang. On the 8th, they entered Baxian. The National Army, which set out from Pingnan, Gu'an, and other four locations in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, has also arrived near Baxian. The clearing work is proceeding smoothly. They will immediately begin repairing the highways between Tianjin and Baoding and between Beiping and Baxian, and they will build blockhouses along the way to ensure the safety of the triangular area. The next operation will gradually unfold.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 8th] The National Army, which is clearing the Ping-Jin-Bao triangular area, captured Yongqing and Baxian yesterday afternoon. Furthermore, Yang Ti-ruo, the magistrate of Xiongxian; Xi Er-kang, the magistrate of Yongqing; and Chen Yunpu, the magistrate of Yuxian, all led administrative personnel and moved into the county seats with the army to begin rehabilitation work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, left Beiping at noon on the 8th and flew to Shanghai, then on to Nanjing, to report on the situation in Hebei Province.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Assembly Members Hold a Symposium to Discuss Practical Issues of Universal Suffrage, Raising Three Points for Government Attention</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] According to the National Assembly Liaison Association, a group of members of the Constitutional Promotion Association remaining in Nanjing initiated a constitutional symposium, which was held at the Chengxian Street Guesthouse at 7:00 PM on the 6th. More than fifty people attended, including Guo Heng, Duan Binglin, Chen Shichang, Song Dongdai, Zhao Zhenzhou, Shen Lingxiu, Guo Anyu, Wang Guangqing, You Hengxiang, Li Zhengtao, Zhou Yintang, Cui Chengzhu, Lai Weiying, Chen Yizhong, Huang Shaomei, Duan Jianmin, Zhao Qingyu, Luo Shaohui, Wang Pixu, Ding Xuanxiao, Shi Qigui, Leng Gangfeng, Su Xianyang, Dai Tianqiu, and Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members Tong Tianxiang and Zhang Lu. They expressed their views on the issue of universal suffrage this year: (1) The Legislative Yuan's determination of the number of legislators from each province and city is based on the highest population figures reported by each province and city between the 16th and 25th years of the Republic, using pre-war figures as the basis for post-war elections. This is actually inaccurate and will inevitably lead to many problems. Taking Sichuan as an example, the population reported in the 25th year of the Republic was more than 51.1 million, while the current reported population is more than 41.1 million, a difference of more than 10 million people. If the Legislative Yuan uses the population figure from the 25th year of the Republic as the basis for determining the number of legislators to be elected, there will actually be more than 10 million surplus votes in the future. What will be done with them? (2) In the northeastern and northern provinces, there are a total of twenty-two provinces and cities that are occupied or disturbed by Communist bandits. If alternative methods are used in these areas, such as selection or designation, it would be a clear violation of the law and a deprivation of the voters' rights. It would be even more difficult to meet the requirement of two-thirds of the total number in Article 8 of the preparatory procedures. What will be done? (3) Regarding the issue of proportional distribution of seats among political parties, although each party avoids discussing it in detail, it is a fact that in preliminary discussions, it is very likely that it will be done in a controlled and monopolistic manner, dividing public opinion and violating democracy, which will inevitably be opposed by the people. If it is not controlled, it will be difficult for small parties to emerge, and they may threaten to withdraw from the government. There was much discussion on the above three difficult issues, but no conclusion was reached. In addition, currently, there are man-made disasters in the north and natural disasters in the south, and the people are suffering and displaced. It is difficult to save the dying, and conscription of soldiers and grain is compounded by the collection of "votes." It is not difficult to imagine how interested they are in the election. Furthermore, at a time when the whole country is being mobilized to suppress the rebellion, if soldiers participate in the election, the front lines will be weakened; if they do not participate, their rights will be deprived. Whether various election matters, such as security, can be handled properly in the short term cannot be achieved with just a piece of paper. In short, this general election is the beginning of a century of constitutional government. The above-mentioned difficulties must be effectively resolved and cannot be compromised or handled carelessly. Therefore, the participants unanimously agreed that the government should face the actual facts, respect public opinion, and handle the elections carefully.</p>
<h3>Provincial and Municipal Election Committees to be Established Before August 20th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The General Election Office held a committee meeting at 4:00 PM on the 8th and decided that all provincial and municipal election committees across the country must be established before August 20th. The attendees at today's meeting were Zhang Lisheng, Liu Dongyan, Jiang Yun, Jin Tigan, Wang Bin, and others, totaling seven people. Hong Lanyou was absent. The resolutions were: (1) The candidates for members of the Legislative Yuan constituency election offices may be proposed by the provincial election offices and submitted to the General Election Office for approval and appointment. The candidates for members of the National Assembly election offices in each county, city, and equivalent district may be recommended by the respective provincial election offices and submitted for approval and appointment. However, the decision on the above candidates shall be approved by the provincial election committee before being recommended. (2) Some provinces and cities, such as Gansu and Shanghai, have requested that citizen identification cards be used in place of election certificates. However, the issuance of election certificates is a mandatory requirement of the election law and cannot be changed. (3) Sun Banghua is appointed as the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Election Office in Santiago. (4) Voters who cannot write may ask someone to write for them at the polling place and affix their private seal or right thumbprint to show their seriousness. It is not necessary to establish a separate scribe for this purpose at the election office in charge. (5) The Supervisory Yuan requested clarification on "whether personnel who have served in public office and have engaged in corruption, and have been impeached according to law and sent for disciplinary action and trial, or whose whereabouts are unknown after summons for detention, have the right to vote and stand for election." The resolution was: "All those who do not meet one of the negative conditions stipulated by the election law shall have the right to vote and stand for election in accordance with the law. As to whether they can exercise it, let it take its course." (6) Each municipal election committee across the country must be established before August 20th, convene meetings in accordance with the law, and recommend candidates for members of election offices at all levels to the General Election Office by telegram for approval and appointment.</p>

<h3>The Two Factions of the Democratic Socialist Party Split, Wu Xianzhang Still Attempts to Dissuade</h3>
<p>Saying He Does Not Approve of Li Daming's Telegram</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since the Democratic Constitutionalist Party's Jinshan Headquarters formally announced its secession from the Democratic Socialist Party, the reporter specifically visited Wu Xianzhang to ask whether he agreed with this decision. Wu said, "The main reason why overseas party members made this decision was because my mediation within the Democratic Socialist Party failed. Li Daming sent a telegram to Zhang Junmai and me on August 1st, and also telegraphed the government. I do not approve of this, so I have sent a telegram to dissuade him. At the full congress on August 15th, I advocate that it be convened in the name of the Democratic Socialist Party, and not in the name of the Overseas General Branch and the Reformists. I have no opposition to Mr. Junmai personally, but I am dissatisfied with the people controlling him from the left and right. If Mr. Zhang can accept my mediation plan, the internal strife of the Democratic Socialist Party can still be eliminated. If he does not accept it, then further measures are still under consideration. I do not intend to participate in the full congress on August 15th, and the overseas branch will send other representatives to attend. The publication of the joint statement was slightly premature. As for the point of acting chairman, it is still under consideration. As for Mr. Zhang Dongsun, I believe that after the full congress, he will be able to participate in the Democratic Socialist Party jointly formed by overseas representatives and the Reformists."</p>

<h3>Qingdao News Circles Attach Importance to the Arrest of Zhang Lingyun</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 8th] The Qingdao news circles attach great importance to the arrest of Zhang Lingyun, the director of the Xinsheng News Agency. Today, all newspapers in the city unanimously voiced their support and negotiated with the authorities. Zhang's family has requested the application of the habeas corpus act. Zhang's whereabouts are still unknown. It is said that Zhang had a dispute over housing with Meng Xufeng, an official of the current Social Affairs Bureau, and was arrested by the police bureau.

<h3>The Chairman Returns to Nanjing from Yan'an; Chief of Staff Chen Goes to Tieling to Comfort the Garrison</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Jiang flew from Nanjing to Yan'an on the 7th for inspection and returned to Nanjing in the evening of the 8th. He made brief stops in Xi'an each way. Cao Shengfen and others accompanied him. When the Chairman was in Yan'an, he summoned his subordinates and gave instructions. He returned from southern Yan'an in the afternoon of the 8th and arrived in Xi'an at 3:30 PM, staying only ten minutes at the airport before flying directly to Nanjing.

<h3>The Members of Our Business Survey Group to Japan Can Be Announced Next Wednesday; We Can Get Seven More Japanese Warships in the Third Batch</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Trade Guidance Committee for Japan is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 13th. The committee members from various agencies have not yet been sent out, but it is heard that the National Resources Commission will send Wu Zhaohong and Zheng Youkui to participate.

<h3>Ambassador Gu Talks to Reporters: The Peace Conference Should Be Held in Our Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Yamer today and exchanged views on the situations in Indonesia and Korea. Afterwards, reporters asked Mr. Gu about China's response to the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. He said: He did not discuss this issue during today's meeting, but explained that China generally agrees with the U.S. proposal. Mr. Gu said: China welcomes the proposal to convene a conference of eleven nations for the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible and does not object to holding the preliminary meeting in Washington or San Francisco, but China hopes that the formal conference will be held in China. Mr. Gu said: Chinese and American experts are currently studying the liquidation of Chinese Lend-Lease accounts, with the aim of establishing negotiations on specific projects in the future. Mr. Gu refused to make any official statement on China's position on the voting procedures. It is understood that China has some opinions on the proposed voting procedures, namely, the two-thirds majority voting method advocated by the United States. China can accept this, but it must include the consent of three of the four major powers in the conference. This is to prevent a single country from using the veto power. It is also understood that this proposal is not a formal proposal, but only a suggestion under study. China itself is not bound by it. If this proposal is not accepted, China reserves the right to reconsider it.</p>
<h3>Resources Plundered from Us are Piled Up in Tokyo; Negotiations for Their Return Have Not Yet Yielded Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Resources plundered by Japan from various countries during the war are currently piled up in four major warehouses in Tokyo, regardless of category, and are being held in custody by the U.S. military. There are many types of resources, including factory machinery, jewelry, furniture, and antiques, most of which were looted from China, and a small portion from Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Our delegation to Japan has repeatedly requested the Allied Headquarters to return them, but the other party requires two documents: (1) proof of ownership, and (2) proof that they were looted by the enemy. The Allied Headquarters insists on following the European example, because when the German army moved the resources of the occupied countries, they issued receipts. If Japan is required to adopt the same method, it is not without difficulties in reality. Recently, MacArthur intends to sell these resources publicly in Japan, using the proceeds as Japan's export fund. Our country is currently working hard to oppose this in Washington and argues that the Philippines and Southeast Asian countries should first be allowed to reclaim the looted resources based on appropriate evidence, and that the remaining resources should be shipped to Shanghai where private individuals can reclaim the looted items based on proof, and the remainder should be auctioned publicly on the market, with the proceeds going to the government. As of now, negotiations have not yet yielded results.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Minister of Trade of the Economic Stabilization Headquarters, Zezawa, stated today in the House of Representatives Business Committee that the Japanese government's Trade Bureau will purchase export goods from manufacturers at high prices to encourage the production of export goods. At the same time, the government will also provide manufacturers with the necessary working capital and assist in establishing new export industries. Also, Japanese importers were ordered today that if they enter into contracts with foreign companies without the approval of the Allied Headquarters, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Relevant Parties Discuss Details of Smuggling; Southern China is the Most Rampant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In order to understand the details of smuggling in various regions of our country, the reporter specifically visited relevant parties, who kindly provided the following answers: (1) Southern China—This is the region with the most rampant smuggling in the country. Smuggled items include cigarettes, dyes, flour, milk, kerosene, western medicine, cosmetics, rayon, gauze, cigarette paper, etc. The smuggling methods include sneaking, using United Relief Association relief material ships, and armed smuggling. All these smuggling activities are centered on Hong Kong and Macau. Relevant parties have concentrated patrol ships and land forces outside the two places to surround them. However, due to the vastness of the sea, our side cannot completely control it, and because the weapons and equipment are insufficient, it has not been fully effective in the past. Personnel and equipment are currently being strengthened. (2) Taiwan Region—Recently, a lot of Japanese goods and Korean goods have flowed into Taiwan by smuggling. Smuggled goods are mostly seafood, because although Taiwan itself is an island, high-end seafood such as shark fins and sea cucumbers are not produced there. There is also some sugar smuggled from Taiwan to Japan, but the amount is small. Recently, many smuggling incidents have been uncovered on the waters around Taiwan. Relevant parties attach great importance to this and have sent ships to patrol the Taiwan Strait; however, it has been ascertained that the smuggling in Taiwan is a large-scale, organized operation, and only by the concerted efforts of various agencies can it be effectively eradicated. (3) North China Region—In the past, there was a period when smuggling was very rampant. In particular, Andong and Korea are only separated by a strip of water, making it the main channel for smuggling. Since the abandonment of Andong, the situation in that area has been unclear. Since the government ordered the blockade of the ports of North China, there have been fewer opportunities for smuggling. As for the rumors of Japanese goods being smuggled into North China recently, Shanghai has not received any reports. Before a Sino-Japanese peace treaty is signed, Japanese cargo ships cannot enter our country's ports, so large-scale smuggling is impossible. (4) There is also small-scale smuggling in Hainan Island, with goods coming from Vietnam, mostly cloth. Relevant parties predict that after Sino-Japanese trade resumes, the smuggling of Japanese goods in Taiwan and North China will be inevitable, because Japan has sufficient goods and ships for export, and their prices are low, which is also welcomed by spenders. At the same time, the highly acclaimed Korean ginseng is feared that it will still be a popular smuggled item. Furthermore, the purpose of some smuggled goods is not to evade customs duties, but is caused by the fact that our country's import quotas are too strict and cannot meet the needs of industry and commerce. Therefore, eradicating smuggling is also related to the government's economic policies. As for export smuggling, the purpose is to evade foreign exchange settlement, because the official exchange rate is too far from the black market.</p>
<h3>Republican Congressman Judd Criticizes U.S. Far East Policy; Young Calls for Foreign Aid to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Headquarters News] San Francisco, August 8 Broadcasting: Republican Congressman Judd delivered a speech at the closing session of the Third World Congress of Jesuits, criticizing the U.S. foreign policy in recent years, especially its policy toward the Far East. He said: China's greatest expectation in the War of Resistance Against Japan was to retain the land in the Northeast. After Japan attacked the United States, China could have allied with Japan at any time, resulting in the sacrifice of at least 100,000 more American lives, but the United States gave away the main seaports and railways in the Northeast to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference as a reward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 7th] Former financial advisor to the Chinese government, Young, delivered a speech in the Los Angeles City Council, summarizing his impressions of the current situation in China, saying: A comprehensive plan of aid to China similar in nature to the Marshall Plan for Europe will be very important at an appropriate time. At the same time, it is imperative to take gradual steps and provide foreign aid to China so that China will not disintegrate after ten years of suffering and hardship. Young explained the Chinese Communist Party, saying: The CCP may establish a regime, and this regime will be ruled by the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Provisional Executive Yuan Resolves to Provide Relief for the Famine in Communist-Affected Areas of North China; 3 Billion Yuan Allocated to Each of the Four Provinces: Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong; Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets for Guangdong and Guangxi Not to Be Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The funds required for the addition of four security teams in Jiangsu Province were approved by the Provisional Executive Yuan on the 8th, totaling 9.102 billion yuan. In addition, the disaster caused by the communist bandits and the drought in the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong have been received, and it has been decided to allocate 3 billion yuan to each province for relief.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The method of saving consumption, which was proposed in coordination with the national policy of general mobilization in wartime, was discussed at the Provisional Political Affairs Meeting of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 8th. In principle, all members expressed their support, but because the original method was too rigid, obstacles were bound to be encountered during implementation. It was decided to appoint Wang Yunwu, Zhu Jiahe, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Hongjun, Gu Zhenggang, Lei Zhen, and Gan Naiguang as a seven-member review group to be responsible for the review. The small group met at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to study the original method in detail. Finally, Wang Yunwu was asked to summarize the opinions of the members, organize them, and submit them to the Yuan meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The flood disasters in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are severe. People from those provinces in Nanjing suggested to the Executive Yuan that disaster relief lottery tickets be issued to provide relief to the disaster victims. This was submitted for discussion at the fourth provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan today. The political committees all believed that the issuance of such lottery tickets would cause more harm than good, and would only increase the speculative mentality of the general public, and would still not allow the wealth held by the rich to be directed towards disaster relief, which would not help the matter in any way, and they all expressed their opposition. President Zhang repeatedly solicited the opinions of the members, and no one agreed, so it was decided not to issue them.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The fourth provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan was held at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 8th, chaired by President Zhang. The resolutions on various cases are selected as follows:</p>
<p>Matters for discussion (1) The case of the method of collecting disaster relief funds for the communist bandit and drought disasters in the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong was resolved and passed.

(3) The case of the funding for the addition of four security corps in Jiangsu Province was resolved and passed. (4) The case of repaying the U.S. dollar compensation coupons for the grain purchased in advance by the two provinces of Yunnan and Shanxi in the 31st year was resolved to be repaid once in legal tender at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>Appointments and dismissals (1) Zou Bingwen was appointed as the alternate to the delegation of our country to the third annual meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Liu Xing was appointed as the deputy representative, Xie Jiasheng was appointed as the consultant, and Wang Liwo was appointed as the secretary and specialist.</p>
<h3>To Relieve National Economic Difficulties, the Wealthy Should Contribute; Wu Chunwu and Others' Opinions on Levying Property Donations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] When the Economic Stabilization Council met on the 7th to discuss the levy of property donations, it was decided that it was difficult to handle this matter and that the procedures needed to be studied in detail, and it was resolved that an expanded symposium would be jointly held by the Legislative Yuan, the National Political Council, and other institutions to discuss it together. On the 8th, reporters separately interviewed Councilors Wu Chunwu and Yin Shuxian. Wu Zhaoxu. Zhang Qianhua and legislators Liu Butong and Tan Tiwu to inquire about their opinions on the levy of property donations. Combining their views, they all believed that the national economic situation was so difficult that the wealthy should take the "those who have wealth should contribute" approach, and actively contribute, and set an example for the world. They disagreed with the Economic Stabilization Council's original proposal to universally levy donations on the wealthy with more than 1 billion yuan. If this donation is implemented universally, the middle and lower classes will be disturbed, and the truly wealthy will be able to avoid it, which would be contrary to the original intention of creating this donation.</p>
<p>Wu Chunwu</p>
<p>Pointed out that if the government can start with the big households, it can not only make up for the financial deficit but also regain people's hearts. The current phenomenon is that the levies, loans, and requisitions are all borne by the poor, which is unfair. The key to suppressing the rebels is to gain the support of the people, and starting with the wealthy households is the best way.</p>
<p>Zhang Qianhua</p>
<p>Advocates selecting one or two wealthy people to levy. When asked by reporters that this matter has no legal basis, Zhang said that during the Anti-Japanese War, a decree was used to confiscate 40% of gold deposits. Why can't we use the same method to deal with the wealthy today? He believes that the situation has reached this point, and we must not tolerate it any longer.</p>
<p>Yin Shuxian</p>
<p>He believes that if it is to cooperate with mobilization, it is appropriate to start with the wealthy, but if it is for permanent construction, property should be universally collected. He believes that the urgent task is how to cooperate with mobilization, because it is enough to levy on a small number of wealthy people, and there is no need to disturb the people any more. The so-called cannon</p>
<p>Wu Zhaolie</p>
<p>He believes that the world is full of people who are doing this. If we start with the wealthy to levy donations, we should ensure that there is no leakage. All the wealthy people recognized by the Chinese people should be on the list of donations. This matter should be formulated as a special law with a revolutionary nature so that the wealthy have no way to escape. Wu also suggested a simpler and easier method. The government should clearly announce private deposits in the United States and requisition them. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has made a suggestion and can further negotiate with the U.S. through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>Liu Butong</p>
<p>He believes that universally levying property donations will hinder the implementation. He pointed out that the movable and immovable property of the truly wealthy cannot be found, and their bank deposits cannot be found. He shouted a novel slogan, that is, the wealthy should restore the lives before the 16th year of the Republic of China, because the wealthy with billions of assets at that time mostly lived in pavilions. Liu also pointed out that Emperor Wu of Han implemented the wealth law, and there are many such examples in history. If donations are only levied from ordinary wealthy households with more than 1 billion yuan in assets, the result will inevitably be to oppress the people, and the truly wealthy will be able to get away with it.</p>
<h3>The Area of Shenyang Urban District is Designated as 400 Square Kilometers</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 8th] The Executive Headquarters held a meeting on the morning of the 8th to discuss the issue of the boundary between Shenyang City and County. Public opinion institutions participated in a heated debate and resolved to expand Pan City to the area of 400 square kilometers designated by the puppet Manchukuo in the 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Expenses of Various Institutions Cannot Be Purchased Without Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Executive Yuan stipulates that the foreign exchange expenses of various institutions must be approved by the Yuan before they can be purchased. However, a small number of institutions occasionally send personnel abroad or order materials from abroad without approval, and then apply for foreign exchange settlement afterwards, which is inappropriate. The Executive Yuan now specifically stipulates that personnel are not allowed to be sent abroad or materials that require the use of foreign exchange are not allowed to be purchased before approval.</p>

<p>Has northern Jiangsu been quiet for several months? Recently, another flood disaster occurred, and the disaster is serious. According to our newspaper's telegram: The cause of this flood disaster in northern Jiangsu was first that heavy rains washed away the rivers, and the Yishui River and Shushui River flooded, causing the counties belonging to Xu, Hai, and Huai to be flooded, and the disaster area reached one or twenty counties, and is still flooding. According to Wang Binxuan, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, who reported to the press on the 4th: As of now, more than 10 million mu of farmland have been flooded, and it is estimated that there are more than one million disaster victims who have lost their homes. The county with the most severe disaster is Pizhou County. The four townships of the county have become a vast ocean, and the drowned people and animals are drifting everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, sadly pointed out on the 5th that Jiangsu Province has had many misfortunes in recent years. Stability was reported last year, but now there is news of floods. The disaster is serious and the autumn harvest is hopeless, which is a major hidden worry. The Yellow River and Huai River are continuing to rise. If the flooding continues, all 36 counties in northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. It is unthinkable if rescue is not urgently planned. Looking at the current situation of the disaster, looking back at the past with scars everywhere, major disasters, and disastrous years, the calamity in northern Jiangsu is no less severe than the disasters in Guangdong and Guangxi; in terms of hidden dangers, it seems to be even more severe than in Guangdong and Guangxi. I hope that the government authorities and social figures will urgently plan to rescue it!</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu is located in the northern part of Jiangsu Province, containing the area north and south of the Huai River, and the area belonging to Xu, Hai, and Huai. There are now 36 counties under its jurisdiction; its location is bounded by the Yellow Sea in the east, the Yangtze River in the south, northern Anhui and eastern Henan in the west, and the Jinpu Line in the north, close to Shandong. Its landform used to be the old course of the Yellow River. Since the Yellow River moved south in the Yuan Dynasty and usurped the Huai River, the Huai River lost its proper way to enter the sea and accumulated in Hongze Lake, and was indirectly divided into the rivers and seas by other waters. Therefore, today's northern Jiangsu is bounded by the Huai River and the Grand Canal. The terrain of the entire territory is low, and the rivers and canals are vertical and horizontal. In the years of heavy water, the river surface is flourishing and rising, and the amount of water that can be contained in the Huai River is limited. When the Huai River has no way to discharge, it will surely cause harm to the lower reaches, especially in the area downstream of the river. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the river administration in northern Jiangsu was abandoned. After the restoration, the Communist Party rioted and specialized in looting, not in construction, and not in river administration. The people of the counties always held fears of land subsidence. After the National Army regained northern Jiangsu, the government and the Executive Headquarters carried out relief efforts, and signs of recovery have appeared in less than a year: but the ambushes in each county have not been completely eliminated, and they are waiting for major disasters in various places to instigate and use the disaster victims to create greater disturbances. The hidden dangers in northern Jiangsu are latent here; unfortunately, this time the disaster struck, and the scars reappeared, and the situation was bleak: if we do not urgently rise up to rescue, cure the root cause and treat the symptoms, and save the people from hanging upside down, the future of northern Jiangsu is really full of worries.</p>
<p>Regarding the relief of the flood disaster in northern Jiangsu, the local government and the people of Jiangsu Province have paid close attention to it; however, this kind of passive "pity" is not enough. We hope that the central government, the Executive Headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and all sectors of the province will focus on the root cause and treatment to seek stability in northern Jiangsu. If northern Jiangsu is stable, Jiangnan will be prosperous. If northern Jiangsu is stable, Shanghai will not be in danger overnight; if Jiangnan is prosperous, Shanghai will not be short of anything. We would like to express our views on the root cause and treatment here for the reference of relevant parties.</p>
<p>Passive flood relief is a symptomatic approach. According to our newspaper's telegram on the 8th, the government has allocated 1 billion yuan in relief funds and 10,000 boxes of canned food to help the disaster victims in the flooded area. At the same time, all sectors of the society in Jiangsu Province are launching an "Xu, Huai, and Hai Water Disaster Relief Association" to appeal to all sectors of Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, to raise 20 billion yuan, and to ask the Executive Headquarters to allocate 5,000 tons of flour for relief needs. We hope that all sectors of Jiangsu Province will quickly start raising relief funds, and that the method of distribution must pay attention to practical effects to help the refugees return to their hometowns and the disaster-stricken farmers return to their fields: the government must also exempt military food requisitions and help them to recover. The active management of water and construction in northern Jiangsu is the fundamental solution. In the past, when Chen Guofu was in charge of Jiangsu, there was a plan to guide the Huai River and began to implement it, but unfortunately, the Anti-Japanese War broke out and it was interrupted. After the Jiangsu Provincial Government regained northern Jiangsu, it formulated the "Five-Year Plan for the Development of Northern Jiangsu", especially with detailed plans for sea defense, irrigation, and drainage: however, the required project cost was 320 billion yuan, and the central and local finances could not cope with it, and the plan still failed. The UNRRA Jiangsu-Ningbo Branch also formulated three plans to cooperate with the post-disaster work in the Yellow River flooded area in northern Jiangsu, such as guiding the Huai River, repairing the Yi River and Shu River, and coastal gates and dams. If implemented, they can all benefit the farmland water conservancy in northern Jiangsu. We hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be sharp and promising: focusing on the construction of northern Jiangsu and the revitalization of northern Jiangsu as the focus of all administration, and according to the established plan, promote the central government and the Executive Headquarters to focus on the water control of northern Jiangsu. If the national treasury is short of money, it should also devise other methods and put it into practice. The Yichang Water Gate project was suspended halfway, and the people of Hubei have proposed to automatically donate to resume work: but as long as there is a center for everything, there is no way to do it.</p>
<p>In short, northern Jiangsu is very important at present. It is half of Jiangsu Province. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Battle of Xuzhou enabled Wuhan to be consolidated. The people and resources of Xuhai made great contributions. After the fall of Xuhai, the 36 counties suffered serious disasters. Since the restoration, it has been repeatedly ravaged by war. Today, a vast ocean surrounds the Huai River, and there are millions of refugees who have no clothes to wear, no place to live, and are crying for food. Returning to their hometowns to cultivate the land, post-disaster relief, and relief are really urgent; I hope that people from all walks of life will follow the spirit of benevolence and provide more relief to save the more than 10 million people in northern Jiangsu from the flood disaster and benefit northern Jiangsu. The stability of northern Jiangsu, the restoration of northern Jiangsu, and the prosperity of Jiangnan are all very important to the future of the country, so we should urgently plan to rescue the flood disaster in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Economic Storm Hits Bangkok: Shantou Far Ocean Company Branch Closure Causes Losses of 13 Billion to Overseas Chinese Remittances</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 7th] Upon learning last night from telegrams from Hong Kong and Shantou about the closure of the Shantou Far Ocean Company branch, an economic storm has once again struck Bangkok. The losses suffered by overseas Chinese who remitted money back to China through the company are currently known to exceed 13 billion yuan. It is said that this is the most serious economic crisis ever encountered by overseas Chinese in Thailand. Qualified observers believe that the Chinese money exchange industry in Bangkok will be completely paralyzed for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The overseas Chinese economic community here, due to the unprecedented economic panic caused by the closure of several large money exchanges over the past three weeks, has seen the crisis largely subside with the full support of the Overseas Chinese Business Arbitration Aftermath Committee formed by influential overseas Chinese businessmen. This economic panic occurred in mid-July, when a branch of a local money exchange in Shantou failed to pay a large sum of overdue promissory notes, as well as remittances from overseas Chinese here.</p>
<h3>Liu Wei-chi Advocates Sending Warships to Console Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Chairman Liu Wei-chi of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission told reporters here yesterday that overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are suffering cruel suppression, and the government urgently needs to make a strong statement about this. While it is indeed difficult to send troops to protect overseas Chinese, the government can send warships to conduct consolations. Currently, overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies also hope that this move can be realized.</p>
<h3>Lu Han Discusses Yunnan Provincial Politics and Schedules a Trip to the Northeast Next Month to Console the Yunnan Army</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Kunming, 8th] After returning to Kunming from the capital, Yunnan Chairman Lu Han told reporters that he had sought instructions from the central government on several important matters. He first mentioned that if provincial finances are insufficient in the future, the central government will still allocate subsidies. County-level finances will adjust tax revenues and re-divide districts, adopting a two-pronged approach of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Regarding public security, because there are still scattered bandits in Yunnan Province, the implementation period of the Bandit Suppression Law will be extended. The central government is concerned that the establishment of the Police and Security Department would affect the financial budget and that supply difficulties are numerous, so Yunnan Province will not establish it for the time being. As for the conscription quota of 14,000 for Yunnan Province, it will be fully conscripted by the end of September. If there is any delay due to transportation obstructions, the central government will also understand and sympathize with the difficulties. At this time of mobilization and suppression of the rebellion, it is hoped that everyone will share the difficulties and make every effort to do their best. Mr. Lu mentioned to reporters at the end that regarding the matter of going to the Northeast to console the Yunnan Army, he will set off in mid-September after the provincial affairs are arranged.</p>

<h3>Government Economic Emergency Measures Bill Passes Second Reading in the British House of Commons, Conservative Party Opposition Ultimately Fails</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 8th Broadcast: The British House of Commons today passed the second reading of the government's Economic Emergency Measures Bill. Prior to this, Churchill delivered a speech criticizing the bill. Churchill said: "The government's proposal of this bill is tantamount to obtaining a blank check, to be used at will. Ministers can act in an authoritarian manner and make arbitrary decisions. Is this program necessary for the people's livelihood and the nation's revitalization? I believe this is a violation of British freedom and peacetime way of life: The opposition party has no confidence in the two-party government," he said. The government, on the other hand, firmly stated that the passage of this bill is necessary to cope with the current crisis.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] The House of Commons today passed the second reading of the government's emergency economic measures bill. An attempt to overturn the decision was defeated by 148 votes to 251. The government hopes to complete the remaining procedures before Parliament adjourns next Wednesday.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Conservative Party leader Churchill this evening submitted a motion of censure to the House of Commons, requesting the rejection of the government's economic emergency measures plan. The nation was shocked, and the parliamentary debate was extremely serious. Churchill said: "As far as I can see, this bill gives the government totalitarian power, allowing it to abuse all the money taken from the hard-working people's pockets." Churchill originally intended not to participate in parliamentary debates before the resumption of Parliament in October this year, but he is now scheduled to attend tomorrow, despite his illness, to personally deliver a speech criticizing the government. Parliament has postponed the summer vacation from tomorrow to the beginning of next Wednesday to allow sufficient time to pass the government's plan. According to a Conservative Party spokesperson, given Churchill's attitude, the party will firmly oppose it, but because Labor Party members occupy a majority, although some leftists have criticized it, its passage is undoubtedly certain. Conservative Party Acting Leader Eden criticized the bill as hastily written, lacking deliberation, and incomplete, and said that what the government is asking us to consider is not a policy but a hope. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Dalton declared in the House of Commons that the number of troops will be reduced to 870,000 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] British Treasury Secretary Stilton recently announced that the loans the United States has lent to Britain will be used up by October, so the purchase of food with cash should be stopped immediately, he said.</p>
<h3>Britain to Request Active Assistance from the United States, Relaxing the Terms of the Loan Agreement is Still Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Responsible sources here said that in the next meeting between Britain and the United States to discuss the economic crisis, Britain will request active assistance from the United States. Simply relaxing the terms of the British-American loan agreement is not enough to cope with the crisis facing Britain. There are two points that can be stated: (1) Assuming that it is impossible for the United States to lend to Britain again, if the U.S. Treasury Department agrees to retain British pound foreign exchange, it can achieve the same purpose as lending again. If so, the British pounds held by New York banks can be transferred to the U.S. Treasury Department without having to be converted into U.S. dollars by the representative of the Bank of England in New York, causing the United Kingdom's exhausted U.S. dollars to continue to decrease. (Canada has expressed its willingness to accept British pounds, but the United States must take action first.) However, the funds required for the U.S. Treasury Department to acquire British pounds held by New York banks may still require congressional approval.</p>
<p>(2) If the United States is willing to ask the International Monetary Fund to declare the U.S. dollar as a scarce currency, then after the declaration, Britain can be exempted from fulfilling the obligations in the loan agreement that it cannot discriminate and must convert British pound foreign exchange into U.S. dollars. The Bank of England only needs to order its representative in New York to no longer approve the conversion of British pounds held by New York banks into U.S. dollars. However, this method is not enough to solve the problem. If the U.S. Treasury Department does not agree to acquire the remaining British pounds held by New York banks, their value will inevitably fall, which will be a de facto devaluation of the British pound. This is something that Washington and London do not want.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Supports British Economic Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Canberra, 7th] Political figures said today that the Australian government will announce measures to help Britain cope with the economic crisis within days, which will generally reduce imports and continue to implement rationing and other controls.

<h3>British Commonwealth Conference to Discuss Peace Treaty with Japan, India Participates on an Equal Footing</h3>

<h3>Set Aside the Soviet Union and Its Vassals, Conclude Peace Together, Talk Given on the Eve of Hoover's Birthday</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 8th] Former President Hoover, on the eve of his seventy-third birthday (the 10th), gave a speech attacking the Soviet Union. He called on the United States to "set aside the Soviet Union and its satellite countries" and seek a separate peace to "reverse" the "wave of disaster" that has swept across the post-war world. Hoover claimed that cooperation with the Soviet Union was "impossible" and that "an armed America could live quite comfortably in isolation."</p>
<h3>Indonesian-Dutch Dispute Likely to Fall into Another Stalemate, the Netherlands Unwilling to Accept International Arbitration, Indonesia Accepts Joint Mediation by the United States and Australia</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] It is reported that the Dutch government is prepared to reject any plan for compulsory arbitration of the Indonesian dispute. According to well-informed sources, the Dutch government agrees to accept the United States as an intermediary to help resolve the Indonesian issue, and does not oppose the United Nations Commission supervising the ceasefire, but is unwilling to accept the mediation or arbitration of the United Nations Commission. The Security Council has temporarily shelved the Indonesian issue and will discuss it again on Tuesday afternoon to give the representatives an opportunity to study the new proposal of the Indonesian government to establish an arbitration committee. The Dutch opinion is expressed at this time.</p>
<p>According to the Indonesian government's notification to the Security Council, on the one hand, it especially accepts U.S. mediation, and on the other hand, it asks the United States to persuade the Netherlands and the Security Council to agree to establish an arbitration mechanism. There is currently no formal proposal to establish an arbitration committee in the Security Council, but it can be asserted that someone will propose it within days. It is reported that the Australian representative is considering this plan, but said that he has not yet decided on action and will first find out the attitude of other representatives and the Dutch government. At the same time, it is planned to recommend to the Security Council that it send a United Nations Commission or formal inspectors to supervise the two-year truce. This plan will be distributed to the representatives of various countries before the meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The Security Council today rejected the Philippines' participation in the discussion of the Indonesian issue. The proposer of the opposition was the United Kingdom, while Australia and India supported the Philippines. The vote resulted in six votes in favor to zero votes against, with the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Soviet Union, France, and the five other countries abstaining. The Security Council decided that seven votes were the legal majority, so the case of the Philippines' participation in the discussion was not passed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 8th] Indonesian representative to Australia Guo Xuemai announced today that the Yogyakarta government has ordered Siam to accept the Australian government's proposal for joint mediation of the Indonesian dispute by the United States and Australia.</p>
<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers to Visit Washington This Autumn to Discuss Details of the Marshall Plan, U.S. Aid to Europe Bill Expected to Be Established by March Next Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Responsible observers here believe that British Foreign Minister Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault will personally discuss the details of the "Marshall Plan" with Secretary of State Marshall in Washington this autumn in order to submit it to the U.S. Congress. The British and French foreign ministers are expected to come to New York in September to attend the United Nations General Assembly, at which time Secretary of State Marshall will likely invite them to Washington for discussions. Now that the U.S. Congress is in recess, there will not be any active activities on the Marshall Plan on the U.S. side in the next two days. However, the committees appointed by President Truman to study the internal economy and resources of the United States will continue to meet, and their reports can be obtained at approximately the same time as the report of the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference. The report of the State Department's Policy Committee on the needs of European recovery can also be completed in mid-September. After receiving this report, the U.S. government will first study it itself, and then solicit the opinions of European countries. The visit of Bevin and Bidault to the United States can participate in this work. Although Marshall and his assistants maintain regular contact with influential people in Congress during the congressional recess, Marshall deeply hopes that before Congress debates the European aid plan, he can first reach some consensus with important figures in Congress. It is expected that the legislative draft submitted to Congress can be completed in November, at which time the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin the committee stage review of the case. In addition to President Truman, key internal officials such as Marshall himself, Treasury Secretary Snyder, Commerce Secretary Harriman, Agriculture Secretary Anderson, and Interior Secretary Krug will all testify before the Foreign Relations Committee, and people from the industrial, agricultural, financial, and labor union leaders will also be invited to express their opinions. The review process of this committee is expected to take six weeks, which will be in December. If there is still time before the Christmas holiday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will then begin a similar process. Congress will resume its session in the first week of January next year, at which time the report, the bill, and the review report of the committee can be listed as the first item on the Senate's agenda for debate. There are more opponents in the House of Representatives, so it is expected that if the Senate can end the debate in two weeks, the House of Representatives will need at least four to six weeks to complete the debate on the case. Therefore, this European aid bill can be expected to complete the legislative procedures before the beginning of March at the earliest.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade Recovery is Near, Japan Requests Input of Raw Materials, Exports Can Be Exempt from Government-Fixed Price Restrictions</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Raze, Director of the Trade Bureau of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, declared at a symposium of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 7th: (1) Raw Material Countermeasures: Japan's past exports accounted for 23% of the national income, from which it can be seen the degree of Japan's dependence on exports. However, Japan's exports cannot exist without the input of raw materials from overseas, so the promotion of exports in the future depends on increasing the necessity of importing such raw materials. The current guiding principle is to make effective use of insufficient raw materials and apply them most to exports. (2) Financial Countermeasures: The Economic Stabilization Board will ensure that manufacturers permitted for trade are not subject to financial difficulties. (3) The price of products takes not disrupting the price system as a premise, and an exceptional price is set for those products that are intended for export but do not meet government-fixed prices.</p>

<h3>A Batch of Puppet Officials, Including Zhang Ke, May Be Released from Prison Soon, Prison is Processing Parole Procedures</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Shanghai Prison is currently processing parole procedures for traitors. According to Article 77 of the Criminal Law: "Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment and have factual evidence of repentance may be granted parole after serving more than ten years of life imprisonment or more than one-half of a fixed-term imprisonment, with the approval of the head of the prison to the highest judicial and administrative authority, but this does not apply to those who have served less than one year of a fixed-term imprisonment."

According to this article, Shanghai Prison has initially prepared a list of traitorous criminals sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of three years or less, selecting those with good character and factual evidence of repentance, which will be reviewed by the prison police, guard, and operations sections, first forming a review committee, then reviewed by the administration committee, and finally submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval. It is reported that there are about ten traitors who initially have hope of parole, and they are currently in the stage of review by the business committee.

<h3>Civil Servants Forced to Move Due to Inability to Find Housing and Become Involved in Litigation Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The High Court heard a housing rental dispute case yesterday. The house at No. 66, Kangle Village, Zhongzheng Middle Road, was originally rented by Mr. Zong to the owner, and then sublet to Qian Wei-fan and Chen Rui-zheng, specialists from the Public Works Bureau. Later, Wu Guanhua purchased the house from the owner and insisted on taking it back for his own use, intending to force Mr. Zong and others to move out. Later, because Mr. Zong could not bear the endless disputes, he automatically withdrew. Because Mr. Qian was a civil servant and unable to find other housing, it led to litigation. After yesterday's hearing, because the owner's accusations did not match the facts, Yang Lin-zhi, the lawyer defending Mr. Qian and Zhu, immediately requested the presiding judge to conduct an on-site inspection to clarify the truth. The court will announce its verdict on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Self-Accusation of Extortion by Zhang Shuping and Others; Further Trial Pending Review of Case Files</h3>

According to the plaintiffs, Zhang Shuping learned that Xu Chengen had been summoned as a witness in the case of suspicion of being a traitor, so he colluded with Yang and Shen, claiming to be staff members of the Ministry of National Defense, and demanded 400 million yuan from Shen and the others, saying that if they did not pay this amount, they would be arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. After Shen and the others pleaded repeatedly, the amount was reduced to 30 million yuan. On the 30th, 13 million yuan was paid first at Zhang Shuping's home. Shen Abao and others reported to the Water Patrol Team of the Garrison Headquarters, and the defendants were arrested.

<h3>Reorganizing Morality and Reforming Social Customs; Solemnly Commemorating Father's Day; Speaker Pan Explains That Being Filial to Parents Is Being Loyal to the Country</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Father's Day Promotion Committee, organized by various circles in this city, held a commemoration meeting for Father's Day at the YMCA at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 300 people from all walks of life attended. Shan Lujian, on behalf of the presidium, presided over the ceremony and delivered a speech explaining the significance of Father's Day and the process of its initiation, saying that all countries in the world have Mother's Day. Loyal people in Shanghai initiated and promoted Father's Day during the period of enemy occupation to show their respect for virtue and gratitude and to resist the enemy puppets. Then, Mr. Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, explaining that being filial to parents is being loyal to the country, and filial piety is the starting point of all good deeds. The filial piety mentioned in "The Classic of Filial Piety" is broad and profound, and it is by no means that accompanying parents on festive days can be called filial piety. He also cited Zengzi's words: serving the ruler without loyalty is not filial piety, performing official duties without respect is not filial piety, not being trustworthy to friends is not filial piety, and being without courage in war is not filial piety. By extension, being filial to parents is being loyal to the country and the nation. Some people previously advocated non-filial piety, which would really make mankind fall into the realm of beasts. Mr. Pan quoted extensively and elaborated in detail, moving the audience. Next, Yuan Xilian, Yan Duhe, Wang Xiaoji, and others gave speeches successively. Mr. Zheng said that he now has dozens of children and daughters-in-law, and over two hundred grandchildren. Hearing the sound of "Dad" is certainly gratifying, but in reality, children do not know how difficult it is to be a father. Finally, 8-year-old student Huang Junjie gave a speech. During the meeting, Zhou Jiaoqing proposed that the Senate and the Education Bureau discuss listing "The Classic of Filial Piety" as reading material for all schools, and Speaker Pan indicated that he would be happy to endorse it. Subsequently, prizes were awarded, and the film "Home of Loyalty" was shown by China Electric before the meeting adjourned. The association presented the famous play "Autumn Begonia," a play about fatherly love, at the Lyceum Theater at 8:00 p.m. to entertain visitors from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>The First and Second Factories of China Tobacco Company to Be Purchased Separately with Priority by the Original Owners; The First Warehouse Has Also Been Reviewed and Returned</h3>
<p>[Our News] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Tobacco Company was ordered to take over the Japanese-owned Huadong and Huapin Tobacco Companies. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, they were renamed the company's First Factory (902 Tangshan Road) and Second Factory (591 Peikai'er Road), and the Third Factory was established at 1039 Tangshan Road at the same time to resume production. The average monthly output of cigarettes is about 6,000 to 10,000 cartons.</p>
<p>Now, the First and Second Factories of the company have been reviewed and returned to their original owners by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Liquidation Office of the Central Trust Bureau. Therefore, the company has submitted a list of the factory sites, raw materials, and machinery of the First and Second Factories to the Central Trust Bureau. It is reported that the First Factory will be purchased with priority by Li Runsheng, the original owner of the Huadong Tobacco Company, and the Second Factory will be purchased with priority by Xia Juchuan, the original owner of the Huapin Tobacco Company. According to the China Tobacco Company, regardless of when the original owners repurchase the factories, the company will still manage and continue to produce in the factories before the procedures are completed.</p>
<p>The China Tobacco Company also has the First Warehouse on Dengtuo Road, which was originally the property of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. This time, it has also been reviewed and returned. However, because a large number of paper and other received materials are still stored in the warehouse, the company previously rented it from the Nanyang Brothers Company for 80 million yuan in warehouse rent. Now, because the original owner is urging its return, the company has prepared a list of the materials in the warehouse and submitted it to the Central Trust Bureau for auction.</p>

<h3>Yu Shengxiao Murder Case; Evidence Collected; Que Li Admits to Being Committed by Malay; Intended to Purchase Gold, Greed Arose; Ma Confesses to Being Intoxicated in the Car</h3>
<p>[Our News] The case of the shooting of Yu Shengxiao, who was engaged in the black market gold trade, has been under investigation for six days since the Englishman Que Li Aque was arrested. The case has now entered a bright stage and the truth will soon be revealed.</p>
<p>Although Que Li initially denied it, after six days of "fatigue interrogation" by the police, he has now admitted that Yu Shengxiao was indeed shot by Malay. He testified to the police yesterday: "Que and Yu Shengxiao were both 'scalpers' engaged in the black market gold and banknote trade. The incident occurred when Malay wanted to ask him to buy five gold bars. He did not have any in hand, so he negotiated with Yu Shengxiao. After the agreement, Malay agreed to go to Hongqiao Airport in the afternoon to pay. At that time, the three of them agreed to go together in a sedan, but unexpectedly, they drove into a deserted area in the suburbs, and Malay became greedy when he saw the money."</p>

<h3>Yang's Chemical Research Institute Plans to Expand Business</h3>
<p>[Our News] Yang's Chemical Treatment Research Institute, which invented the anti-syphilis needle drug "New Xihua Powder," was established on August 15, 1937. At that time, it only occupied one building at No. 1267 Yuyuan Road and built a small laboratory for private research. Later, due to practical needs, the scale gradually expanded. To date, the original site has occupied six buildings, and two Western-style houses on the third floor of the Xinyi Building are occupied in the north.

<p>Telecommunications Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</h3>
<p>[Summary] (1) The Q&amp;A in this column will be disclosed once a week on Saturdays. (2) Letters are limited to questions related to telecommunications business. (3) Please indicate "Telecommunications Business" on the letter. (4) The text should be concise. (5) Please write your real name and address on the letter. We may reply directly by letter if necessary.</p>
<p>[Xiao Choucheng from Maoming Road asks] (1) Are there distinctions between ordinary, urgent, and express long-distance calls? What are their natures? (Answer) Yes. Urgent and ordinary calls are divided into call number, call person, and call out. Urgent calls are connected within one hour after registration. Ordinary calls are connected within two hours after registration. However, for call-out calls, you must wait until the recipient arrives at the business office of the bureau before the call can be connected. Express calls are connected within ten minutes after registration. Currently, it is open to Wuxian, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Yin County, Jiaxing and other seven places. Only one type of call number communication is temporarily open, and it is limited to two times when busy. (2) If Deng Ren has any unclear points about your bureau's long-distance telephone business, where can he inquire? (Answer) If users have any questions about our bureau's long-distance telephone business, or if the service of the long-distance station duty operator is not satisfactory, they can call "482788" or 〇2 "61442" our bureau's "Inquiry and Complaint Station" for inquiry and complaint.</p>
<p>[Sun Ming from Julu Road asks] When I send telegrams, I deeply feel that the text is lengthy, which costs money and time. Is there a way to save money? (Answer) In addition to shortening the telegram as much as possible, the recipient's address can also be simplified. For example, "No. 1568 Nanjing Road" has a total of eleven characters. If it is written as "Nanjing Road (1568)," it is only five characters. If you can use registration instead of the recipient's name and address, only one character is needed.</p>
<p>[Xia Rongming from Tushanwan, Xujiahui asks] How is long-distance telephone billing calculated? (Answer) The long-distance telephone billing standard is divided into six types: ordinary call number, call person, call out, urgent call number, call person, and call out. They are calculated according to the ratio of 1.1.5.2.2.2.5.3. For example, if the ordinary call number price from Shanghai to Wuxi is 7,000 yuan, then the ordinary call person is 10,500 yuan, the ordinary call out is 14,000 yuan, the urgent call number is 14,000 yuan, the urgent call person is 17,500 yuan, and the urgent call out is 21,000 yuan. Fractions below 1,000 yuan are not counted if they are below 250 yuan. If they are between 250 yuan and 700 yuan, they are calculated as 500 yuan. If they are above 750 yuan, they are calculated as 1,000 yuan. The cancellation fee is charged at one-fifth of the ordinary call number, with a minimum amount of 500 yuan and a maximum amount of 7,500 yuan. The rest is deduced by analogy.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Smuggling in South China</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou, 3rd</p>
<p>The rampant smuggling in South China has long been a well-known fact nationwide. Because of the presence of Hong Kong and Macau, Guangzhou has become the general hub for the import and export of smuggled goods. Therefore, the occurrence of smuggling cases involving tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of dollars, is as common as "daily meals" and not surprising. However, the recent crackdown by the Guangdong Customs on the</p>
<h3>Foshan Ferry Smuggling Case from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>cannot help but draw attention, because the amount of smuggled goods involved is truly shocking and represents an unprecedented record for the Guangdong Customs in terms of the scale of its anti-smuggling efforts.</p>
<p>The case was cracked on July 25th. The Foshan ferry arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong that morning. However, the customs had already received a tip-off the day before, stating that the ferry was carrying a large number of smuggled goods and attempting to evade taxes upon entry. On the morning of the 25th, the customs dispatched anti-smuggling personnel, accompanied by military police, aboard a vessel to the Tie Men area outside Huangpu, where they boarded the ferry to conduct a routine search for smuggled goods and closely monitored the suspected areas. Around 7:00 a.m., the ferry arrived in the city, and the customs dispatched additional personnel to board the ferry and conduct a search. However, no smuggled goods were found anywhere. Later, customs officers searched according to the reported location and discovered 108 pieces of smuggled goods (each approximately 90 cubic meters in volume) hidden within the ship's hull lining and coal piles in the engine room. In the afternoon, they received another tip-off stating that there were still some smuggled goods hidden on board. The customs then dispatched more personnel to search, and they discovered another 85 large packages and 13 small items of similar smuggled goods, totaling 193 large items and 13 small items. These included valuable items such as ginseng, deer velvet, expensive Chinese and Western medicines, automobile parts, foreign leather, cellophane, pigments, saccharin, and other valuable goods, weighing over 30,000 pounds and valued at over HK$300,000, equivalent to approximately 2 billion yuan in current national currency. At that time, customs police and military police escorted the batch of smuggled goods back to the customs for processing.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, the 26th Regiment of the stationed military police in Guangzhou immediately sent personnel to inquire about the shipowner Newton and the engineer A. Chen (both British). However, they claimed that they were completely unaware of the smuggling and that it was carried out secretly by</p>
<h3>Workers in the Engine Room</h3>
<p>They also stated that five engine room workers had fled after the incident. The customs also submitted a written inquiry to the shipowner that evening. The shipowner replied that the smuggled goods may have been smuggled onto the ship in Hong Kong on the 23rd or 24th. This answer was, of course, an attempt to shirk responsibility, because the volume and number of smuggled goods were so large that it would have taken considerable time to move them from the shore onto the ship and hide them in the hull lining and coal piles of the coal bunker, and it would not have been possible to hide this from the eyes and ears of ordinary personnel. If it were not for the connivance of senior personnel on the ship, how could this have happened? Moreover, according to the authorities' investigation, the hidden compartment for storing the smuggled goods seemed to have been specially manufactured. The compartment door was closed with an iron door and secured with fixed screws, a technique of extreme ingenuity (as shown in the picture). Therefore, from this speculation, it is likely that this was a</p>
<h3>Planned Smuggling Activity.</h3>
<p>The shipowner's claim of not knowing is clearly an excuse. The military police and customs have now reported the matter to the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, demanding that the shipowner hand over the five escaped workers and the masterminds, and ordering the ship to be suspended from sailing. The ship is currently being detained on the Bai'etan River surface in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief attaches great importance to this case. This reporter interviewed Deputy Director Deng Nengguang, who stated that this is a major smuggling case in South China. The central government has long recognized that the issue of smuggling in South China affects the national economy and is determined to eradicate it at the root. Therefore, the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief is paying special attention to this case and has sent personnel to the ship to photograph all the hidden equipment and a large batch of smuggled goods for record-keeping. At the same time, a special report has been submitted to the central government to request instructions. Deng also stated that the ferry and the Wuxue ferry, which was previously involved in smuggling, belong to the same company, Taikoo Dockyard. The company has not yet fulfilled the fine imposed on the previous Wuxue ship for smuggling. Now, the company's Foshan ferry is involved in large-scale smuggling again. Who can believe that this is not a planned act by the personnel on the ship?</p>
<p>As for the Taikoo Dockyard, it has not yet made any statement.</p>
<p>After this case occurred, it became a topic of conversation on the streets. Some people even said: The smuggled goods are worth HK$300,000, and including the small-scale smuggling that has not been investigated, it should be over HK$400,000, which is equivalent to more than US$93,000, and it is not much different from the quota of US$100,000 approved by the Transportation Control Committee for import to Guangzhou this quarter. This remark is naturally a bit satirical, but it is also sufficient to provide for the authorities' reference. If smuggling cannot be stopped, then import restrictions are not just a formality?</p>
<h3>Uranium! Rich and Pure Production in Guangxi. Scientists to Set Off for Mining. Equipment for Bombarding Atomic Nuclei Has Been Ordered from the United States</h3>
<p>[Guangxi Guangshe News] Uranium ore is the basic raw material for making atomic bombs. Some scientists around the world have exhausted their efforts to successfully research it. However, this mineral is extremely rare in production. Currently, the only uranium-producing areas in the world are Colorado and Utah in the United States, Kantanga in the Belgian Congo, Great Bear Lake in Canada, Cornwall in the United Kingdom, Madagascar, and a small amount of production in southern Australia, the Czech Republic, and Portugal in the Soviet Union. Therefore, research and experimentation are extremely difficult. In May 1943, Chinese geologist Nan Yanzong went to Guangxi to investigate tin ore and discovered this type of uranium ore in Huangqiangping, Honghua District, Zhongshan. He took the sample back to the Geological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, where geologist Wu Leibo used microchemical analysis to prove that it was indeed pure uranium ore. Last year, the Mineral Survey and Exploration Office of the Resources Committee, together with the Central Geological Survey, sent geologists to Guangxi for detailed investigation. It was found that the Huangqiangping mining area and its vicinity are all composed of granite, followed by the intrusion of albite porphyry, which is then drilled by pegmatitic granite. The uranium ore grows along the twist surface of the albite porphyry. The determined uranium-containing minerals include pitchblende, carnotite, autunite, mica, calcium-uranium mica, and uranophane. Not only are the reserves abundant, but the quality is also extremely pure, far superior to the uranium ore found in Haicheng, Northeast China, and Samantian and Yuxin in Wuyuan, Suiyuan, and Maotou Town in Northeast China. It is reported that relevant parties believe that this type of uranium ore is extremely rare and that efforts should be made to conduct research, catch up, and add a unique color to the Chinese scientific community in terms of science, national defense, industry, and human happiness. It has now been decided to hire many authorities in the scientific community to go to Guangxi to engage in development for experimentation. Preparations are currently being made, and they will depart as soon as they are completed. As for the instrument for bombarding atomic nuclei, it has been ordered from the United States and can be transported to Guangxi via Hong Kong in the near future. (8th)</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Protection Command Orders the Suppression of Bandits in Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 8th] The Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Protection Command telegraphed the Suzhou County government today, stating that Jin Jiarang, a bandit in Taihu Lake who was once pacified, gathered more than 300 people this spring due to a large deficit and fled back to the lake to become a bandit, frequenting the vicinity of Xishan and specializing in robbing merchant ships.

<h3>Clouds and Mist Hanging Low, Deep Wind and Rain. Summer Capital Presents Autumnal Scenery</h3>
<p>[Report from Guling, this newspaper, 8th] This newspaper's reporter sent a telegram one hour after arriving in Guling. Outside the window, clouds and mist hang low, the wind and rain are uncertain, and the mountains are lush green, with white clouds drifting in between. This is indeed the place where one is already in the "deep clouds, location unknown." The autumn atmosphere in the mountains arrived much earlier than the Beginning of Autumn. This year's summer capital is obviously different from last year's. One reason is that the date of the Chairman's arrival has not been determined, and there is no political atmosphere here except for news reporters. Another reason is that the essence of Guling's city streets was destroyed in a major fire this spring and is currently being rebuilt after the disaster. However, everything presents an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.</p>

<h3>Miss Hong Kong Files for Divorce. In Addition to Verbal Complaints, She Issues a Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng, 5th, Hong Kong, this newspaper] Wu Danfeng, the "Miss Hong Kong" who finally emerged after much anticipation, signed a contract with the Sino-British Film Company on the night she was elected to play the female lead in a certain film. Thus, "Miss Hong Kong" leaped to become a "movie star"! The radio station then hired her to host a special broadcast of contemporary songs, and the advertisement inevitably added the honorific title of "Queen of Song." For a time, "fortune arrived unexpectedly," and after Wu Danfeng ascended the dragon gate, she immediately made rapid progress and became the "most important woman" in Hong Kong. She was so busy with being invited to cut ribbons, inscribe titles, dine, and take photos that she was overwhelmed.</p>
<h3>Not Miss, But Actually "Mrs. Hong Kong"</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, extremes meet, and excessive joy breeds sorrow. Recently, this "Miss Hong Kong" suddenly became the target of attacks. It turned out that this "Miss" had already been married and had already given birth to a son and a daughter! This fake "Miss" naturally disappointed the enthusiastic supporters. "Miss Hong Kong" changed to "Mrs. Hong Kong," which was both comical and laughable. After this secret was exposed, "Miss Hong Kong's" limelight was not as strong as before.</p>
<h3>Destroying Beauty, Her Husband Actually Used His Fists</h3>
<p>Logically, being the husband of "Miss Hong Kong" is a matter of great honor. However, Wu's husband, Qu Xiyuan, believed that "Miss Hong Kong" brought him infinite humiliation. Wu went to participate in the competition in Macau that time, and it was hidden from him beforehand. Later, Qu saw the Hong Kong newspapers in Macau, learned about this news, rushed to Hong Kong, and scolded her severely. After verbal conflict, Qu also used his fists and monitored Wu's actions, not allowing her to cross the line. On August 1, there was another conflict between the couple. "Miss Hong Kong" was petite and weak, how could she be a match for her husband's ferocity? As a result, she was beaten with bruises all over her body, whimpering like a pear blossom in the rain. Destroying beauty is really too insensitive, Mr. Qu.</p>
<h3>Proceeding with Divorce, Issuing a "Written Statement"</h3>
<p>After being beaten, "Miss Hong Kong" went to stay temporarily at the home of her brother, Wu Bang, and filed a lawsuit and formally filed for divorce. When reporters went to interview Wu Danfeng, they saw many scars on her jade arms and tears in her eyes, and they all sympathized with her unfortunate experience. In addition to verbally complaining about her husband's abuse, she also issued a "written statement" as follows:</p>
<p>"The accumulated grievances and sorrows of my life over the past ten years or so have been released a little today. I want to divorce him so that we, a resentful couple with different opinions, can both find a new path in life after the divorce. If I continue to endure it and am often beaten and scolded and arbitrarily destroyed by him, my future and happiness will be greatly hindered and harmed. His attitude is really irritable and is becoming more and more intense. But I finally declare that the reason for the divorce is not the motive after I was elected "Miss Hong Kong," but it is really compelled to be so. I hope the public understands the truth of the matter."</p>
<p>After the divorce, Wu Danfeng will be the "Hong Kong Miss" who is "true to her name."</p>

<h3>Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks Collapse Simultaneously, Deficient in Total Funds of 6.8 Billion; Related to the Suspension of Zhenghe in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhenghe Bank at 205 Nanjing Road and Bachuan Bank at 731 on the same road in this city were both unable to promptly compensate for the lack of funds in the clearinghouse yesterday. The clearinghouse issued a circular to suspend clearing for both banks.</p>
<p>Both Zhenghe and Bachuan Banks are listed as agent clearing houses in the clearinghouse. Zhenghe's clearing house number is 211, and Bachuan's is 150. According to the results of the clearinghouse on the 7th, Zhenghe had a shortfall of 2.7 billion yuan, and Bachuan had a shortfall of 4.1 billion yuan. According to the clearinghouse's regulations, the balance must be compensated by 8:30 PM that evening. After a concession was made to extend the deadline to 9:10 AM yesterday morning,</p>
<p>both banks still failed to find a way to compensate. The clearinghouse immediately sent a circular to each clearing house to suspend the banks' check clearing starting from today (the 8th). As of 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, both banks were still unable to compensate, and the clearinghouse immediately reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>
<p>It is understood that the liquidity problems of the two banks are directly related to the sudden suspension of Zhenghe Bank in Hong Kong on the 6th. The current chairman of both banks is Peng Bingcheng, who also serves as the chairman of the Far East Trading Company. It is reported that recently, the Far East Company transported a large batch of surplus materials from overseas. After arriving at the port, prices were stagnant, and the funds stuck as a result have reached several billion yuan. In addition, Zhenghe Bank in Hong Kong made strategic mistakes, and there is also talk of the Far East Company's branch in Siam shutting down, causing a rush to withdraw funds, which dragged everyone into the vortex.</p>
<p>The Operating Principles Have Always Been Unsound</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of a certain department of the Central Bank speaking to reporters: The account books of the two banks have been repeatedly inspected by personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. It was discovered that the lending business was too loose, and the operating principles were unsound. Every night, a large amount of cash had to be融解to compensate for the overdrafts in the clearinghouse, so warnings had been repeatedly given. Fortunately, the unstable operating conditions of the two banks had long been rumored among industry peers, so everyone was cautious and guarded against it in advance. After the suspension of clearing, there was no impact on the industry. It is now found that the two banks have a deposit reserve of approximately 400 million yuan in the National Bank. The total amount of deposits in the two banks is approximately 3.5 billion yuan or more, leaving a shortfall of over 3.1 billion yuan. In addition, the balance of accounts receivable and payable on the two banks' books is a shortfall of more than 2 billion yuan. The amount of arrears is not significant, and it is hoped that they can be urged to clear them up within a short period of time.</p>
<p>According to the observation of the person in charge: The aftermath issues of the two banks: handled in accordance with the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, although the two banks are called branches in this city, because the center of the business is in Shanghai, according to regulations, the licenses should be revoked. However, it is said that the head office of Zhenghe Bank is registered in Hong Kong, and it may be handled separately.</p>
<p>The Chairmen Are Both Peng Bingcheng</p>
<p>Zhenghe Bank was established around 1942. It established a branch in Shanghai on December 6, 1946. The head office is located in Guangzhou, and it is also said to be in Hong Kong. Guangzhou is the general management office. In addition, there are branches in Chongqing, Kunming, Wuzhou, and other places, and an office in Kangding. The capital is 300 million yuan. Peng Bingcheng is the chairman and also serves as the general manager. The manager of the Shanghai branch is Dou Xiaodong.</p>
<p>Bachuan Bank was officially established in Tongliang, Sichuan in November 1940. It established a branch in Shanghai on March 14, 1946. It has also established branches in Tianjin, Hankou, Taihe Town in Sichuan, and Hechuan. There are also offices in Mianyang, Suining, and Tongnan. The paid-up capital is 70 million yuan. Peng Bingcheng is also the chairman, Liu Xiweng is the general manager, and Gu Jiwen is the manager of the Shanghai branch.</p>
<p>As for the Far East Trading Company related to the two banks, Peng Bingcheng is also the chairman. The company's business center is in Hong Kong, and it also has a branch in Siam. Suddenly, two banks in the banking sector announced instability, and many people outside the market suddenly offered to unload goods. The interest rates opened high, and many arbitrageurs in the market sold永紗immediately, which finally turned from strong to weak.

The stock exchange market revealed yesterday that Yong An has branches in Singapore and Batavia. The company's branch in this city is located on the third floor of Zhenghe Bank at 205 Nanjing Road. Recently, they published large advertisements in newspapers to sell a large number of remaining materials.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates Open High Outside the Market; Chinese Stocks Turn from Strong to Weak</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were weak again yesterday after rising. One-third of永紗 is not listed and circulated, and the market has already announced it, which has caused misunderstanding among the people. The market was quiet. Finally, due to the sudden instability of two banks in the banking sector, many people outside the market suddenly offered to unload goods, and the interest rates opened high. Many arbitrageurs in the market sold永紗 immediately, which finally turned from strong to weak. Xin Ya once reported a limit down in bad rumors, and there were not many transactions in the market. The general trend did not deviate from fluctuating.</p>

<p>Government bonds regained popularity yesterday, and buyers emerged one after another. Even if people from the Chaozhou group, such as Dachengxing, took profits, Room 360 bought immediately after selling, and Rooms 555, 503, and 552 competed to buy. National Bond C rose from an opening price of 12,100 yuan in the morning to close at around 14,300 yuan.

<h3>Food Rice Fluctuates Narrowly; New Japonica Rice Arrives More and Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 6,200 shi of rice arrived in the North and South Markets. The market in the South opened in the morning and continued to weaken by 10,000 yuan. At noon, the shops' appetite to import rice increased, and the market stabilized. As a result, the decline in japonica rice was limited, and the same was true for early-season thin rice. Indica rice was mostly stable, and白陰元also showed little change. However, a surge of new japonica rice arrived, which could not be digested, causing a sharp drop of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. In the North Market, japonica and indica rice continued to soften, new japonica rice fell sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and白陰元also showed little change.</p>
<p>Flour shops' appetite for import was weak, and prices fell by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There is still a large supply of杂牌flour, which is difficult to prosper for the time being. Bran's sales in the countryside were stagnant, weak but not drunk. Soybean cake has become deserted, and the price has been reduced by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The arrival and sales of soybeans were balanced, and the market stood firm. The digestion of new soybeans was acceptable, and the situation was lively. Danyang's new green soybeans arrived in Shanghai for the first time, and the quality was still soft.　Soybean萎lack of energy, and the price fell by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans are still retail, and merchants from other provinces have slightly purchased them, resulting in a continuous increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans are firm, and field peas are scarce and popular. Corn has a rising trend, and the supply and demand of red sorghum are not strong, so the market is mediocre. Sesame has a dull and sluggish transaction volume. Raw peanuts in Southeast Asia have been relaxed, recovering 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Wheat remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The oil market suddenly rose and fell. Merchants from Guangdong reappeared in a lively buying pattern.

Vegetable oil, however, was not well digested in this street and remained stable.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The new wheel of Fulai Company, the Indian Yimeili, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 3,500 tons of imported rice from Yangon. It also transported 65 bundles of sandalwood and 145 pieces from Singapore. It is now berthed at buoys No. 4 and No. 5 for unloading. It is also learned that the Hai Chen wheel under the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Yangon on the 4th of this month and is said to be loading 7,000 tons of rice to be shipped to Shanghai. It is currently being loaded and is expected to be completed and return to Shanghai in the middle of next week.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Adopts a Flexible Approach to Weekly Pricing of Rayon; Silk Weaving Industry Sets to Hold Members' Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The issue of the pricing of rayon by the China Trust Bureau is still being appealed by the silk weaving industry. The China Trust Bureau is still listening to the instructions from above, but there are currently no signs that the pricing can be changed. According to a person in charge of the Bureau, the Bureau's pricing is determined to be adjusted once a week. The pricing is based on past prices. At the beginning of the allocation last year, the pricing was close to the black market price. At that time, the pricing of Jin San Ma was 2.78 million, while the black market price was 3.3 million. Subsequently, due to the time-consuming nature of government documents going back and forth, the pricing had an opposite distance from the black market. In the future, a flexible approach should be adopted to cope with the evolution of the market. If the black market price decreases next week, the pricing can be changed. A 10% reduction in market prices this time is reasonable.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the silk weaving industry held a small group meeting in the guild yesterday afternoon because the request to reduce the price of rayon sold by the bureau was not granted. The meeting decided to unite the factories to write to the industry guild and convene a general meeting immediately to allow all members to vote on their opinions. It is reported that the members' meeting has been scheduled to be held at the Chamber of Commerce on Sunday (the 10th) at 8:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Too Low a Price is Also Not Appropriate</h3>
<p>Also reported: According to Wu Rencang, Director of the China Trust Bureau, the black market price of rayon has been hovering around 24 million recently. The Bureau has 6,000 boxes of rayon in stock, which is not enough for market demand. If the price is too low, it will be convenient for manufacturers to profit from it. The opinion of Director Wu of the bureau is limited to an increase of 50%, that is, the price of each box is 13.5 million yuan, which is too low. The bureau is currently discussing it. The pricing will be increased by about 100% compared to the previous 9 million yuan. The decision date is not far away.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Purchases Cased Tea; Pays 60% of Standard Price in Advance; Qihong Price at 720,000 Yuan per Dan</h3>
<p>After the tea merchants applied to the China Trust Bureau for the purchase of cased tea in 1946, the China Trust Bureau, in order to take care of the merchants' difficulties, specially paid 60% of the price in advance at the agreed standard tea price, as the grading of various tea types was still being assessed. The remaining 40% will be settled after the various grades have been assessed. The standard price of Qihong is 720,000 yuan per dan, Tunlv is 900,000 yuan, and Pinglv is 480,000 yuan, each paid at 60% in advance.</p>
<p>Also reported: Since the buying interest in domestic and foreign tea has shrunk, the market has not been as active as it has been in recent days, and the transaction volume has also been frequently reduced. The price of脚地is still stable, and the holders, in view of the fact that the inventory in the market is not abundant, all intend to sell at firm prices. Also learned that the Wuxi area is continuing to like low-grade black tea, and is trying to suppress purchases, resulting in rice transactions.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was initially brisk as weaving factories slightly absorbed the yarn, but the market then deteriorated because the price of the spinning and adjustment meeting was lowered, and the Spinning Difficulty Company opened for sale with abundant筹码, market confidence became increasingly depressed, and the market mood suddenly became unsustainable. By the end, the 42-count blue phoenix yarn fell by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 16.45 million yuan. The 32-count blue phoenix fell sharply by 750,000 yuan, to 13.1 million yuan. The 20-count特雙馬also fell slightly by 350,000 yuan, to 11.75 million yuan. The light雙馬was 10.2 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan. The prices of other various counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 100,000 to 200,000 to 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also reported: China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, with a total of 585 pieces sold to 179 purchasing manufacturers.</p>
<h3>White Paper Falls</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Over 4,000 tons of 美加拿大对开 white paper will be transported to Shanghai on the 17th of this month, so the market price of white paper has fallen in recent days.</p>

<h3>Distorted Theory</h3>
<p>— Canglong</p>
<p>I happened to hear some people at a meeting of doctors advocating greatly expanding the number of doctors in terms of quantity. Whether they are graduates of formal medical schools, or nurses, or hospital attendants, as long as they can obtain a license issued by the government. Because in the pitiful Chinese country, it is really unknown how many thousands of people it takes to find a Western doctor. When we run around the mainland, we may be able to buy cigarettes everywhere, but it is difficult to buy even the most basic aspirin or Bagua Dantou pain powder, not to mention so-called Western doctors and pharmacies. Therefore, for the sake of practical benefits, it is best to produce a large number of doctors in the short term, without having to overemphasize the qualitative aspects, because no matter what, "having" is better than "not having" after all.</p>
<p>True, this argument sounds really pleasant. When we review the current state of the Chinese medical community, we certainly want to support this argument with 120,000 points. However, there are two points that we should pay attention to, and we must raise them for everyone to discuss:</p>
<p>(1) The speaker, facing the realistic needs, advocates greatly expanding the number of doctors in terms of quantity. This is an undeniable good theory. However, the speaker forgot his own identity, abandoned his own rights and interests, and the doctors who were on the same front as him. Because the "purpose" of organizing a guild is nothing more than using the power of the guild to protect the rights and interests of all members. Now the speaker only thinks that there is a lack of medical personnel in the country and advocates producing a large number of doctors, but he forgot that he is not an official, and he forgot that he is only a public servant elected by the members of the medical association. Shanghai is already crowded with many doctors. Of course, there are many with good business, but there are more with bad business. If we continue to relax the dimensions and produce many doctors, and they crowd into Shanghai and refuse to go elsewhere, wouldn't that directly harm the rights and interests of the members themselves? To be honest, many members are also complaining about heaven and earth.</p>
<p>(2) Which is more beneficial or harmful, the expansion of "quantity" or the enrichment of "quality"? We are not the authorities responsible for medical administration, so we are not in a position to speak. I only hope that everyone will pay attention</p>
<p>to the history of the past decades without scissors for Western medicine, then we can know that the expansion of quantity does not necessarily make sense.</p>
<p>Okay! If the speaker has not forgotten his own position, if the speaker knows that he must protect the rights and interests of the members of the medical association, and if he has no other intentions, then this distorted theory should be published less in the future.</p>
<h3>Important Notice for Students Taking Medical School Entrance Exams (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ruan Shangcheng</p>
<p>The government's purpose in encouraging students to learn foreign languages is to "seek knowledge." However, as it has evolved to this day, it has had other, more important effects besides seeking knowledge, especially in our medical field. All students taking medical school entrance exams should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>On the European continent in the mid-19th century, almost all those in charge of health administration were legal experts. Later, medical administration gradually fell into the hands of those who studied medicine. In recent years, in English-speaking countries, it has gone a step further, with only those who have studied public health being able to specialize in health administration. Compared with continental countries, there are still similarities.</p>
<p>In our country, in all academic fields, no matter which foreign language is studied, although there are different factions, they can still cooperate and work together. However, our medical field is very different, and of course, there are reasons for this. Here are the main ones: (1) There are more medical personnel who study English than those who study other foreign languages. (2) Since the introduction of modern medicine in China, English-speaking countries have advanced both evangelism and medicine. In the past, patients who wanted to receive Western medical treatment had to go to a church hospital, and English and American Protestant churches were more widespread in China than old churches. Therefore, hospitals or medical schools were established everywhere, and almost all Chinese people who studied medicine studied English (very few studied French or German) and could obtain opportunities for practice and further study everywhere. The number of factories or industrial schools established in China by English and American countries is far less than the number of hospitals and medical schools. Therefore, it is not as convenient for people to study other subjects as it is for medicine. (3) In English-speaking hospitals, for the sake of foreigners, everything is of course done in English. When Chinese medical students discuss medical conditions in front of patients, in order to avoid the patients' worries and prevent them from knowing the dangers of their conditions, they all communicate in English. Moreover, because the Chinese medical terminology has not yet been finalized, it is more convenient to talk in a foreign language than to speak Chinese. After many years, there are very few opportunities to use Chinese every day. Therefore, in daily life, whether it is social events, lectures, or even letters and official documents, everything is in English. In addition, foreign-run schools consider Chinese to be an unimportant subject, so not everyone can know the application of Chinese and the beauty of Chinese. (4) Since the success of the revolution in our country and the establishment of health administration, medical science has received a large amount of subsidies from English-speaking countries, and the methods of health administration have of course followed the same path as English-speaking countries. Those who study public health can even take charge of party health administration. Under this trend, it is inevitable that there will be places where people are controlled, but for the sake of current interests, why wouldn't the government take the easy route? Even those who only understand English but cannot read Chinese characters or speak Chinese can hold great power in medical affairs, and society does not find it strange. Moreover, after the victory, those who speak Japanese manage the Japanese, and those who speak German manage the Germans. This is a natural principle and also the easy route. There is absolutely no reason to send someone who studies Russian to manage the Japanese and create trouble for themselves.</p>
<h3>Sunlight and Health (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Eighth, regarding the relationship with dust: Pathogens living in dust can be killed by strong sunlight, reducing the risk of disease transmission caused by dust flying around.</p>
<p>The above points show the relationship between sunlight and life, and its inseparable connection with a healthy life. However, whether sunlight is beneficial or harmful to the human body is a point that should be explored. We know that the main source of sunlight is sunlight. Due to the different lengths of light waves, it is divided into ultraviolet rays and infrared rays. The light waves we see every day are only a part of the light waves. Now, according to the different light waves, we will describe their impact on health:</p>
<p>(1) Light: Daily work is completed with the help of light. Too weak or too strong light can hinder health. Because the main function of light is to illuminate work, this is a direct relationship. Indirectly, when light shines into the body, people can absorb light and convert it into heat. Therefore, a part of the human body's warmth is obtained from external light and used as kinetic energy for bodily functions, such as hematopoiesis and metabolism. If you work in the dark for a long time, you can gradually weaken, develop anemia, and contract pulmonary tuberculosis. The relationship between light and the eyes is very important. If the light is too weak, it is easy to become nearsighted because the eye muscles lengthen and cannot contract. There is also the possibility of developing nystagmus due to too weak light. This is because the eye muscles are fatigued and the convergence is uncoordinated, making it impossible to concentrate and seeing objects as if there are two, completely unable to fixate. If the light is too strong, there are fewer obstacles to the eyes. However, working under strong light for a long time can irritate the eyes and cause fatigue, leading to nearsightedness. It can also specifically cause night blindness and scotoma, which are all caused by too strong light. The protective method is to wear colored glasses and not work under too weak or too strong light for a long time. It would be even better to find a way to adjust the light intensity naturally.</p>
<p>(2) Ultraviolet Rays: Ultraviolet rays have a strong lethal effect on bacteria and a destructive effect on human cells. If irradiated for a long time, it can cause symptoms such as redness, pain, and blisters. However, the body has the function of absorbing ultraviolet light. Although the skin's dermis is damaged, it cannot penetrate deep layers and destroy body cavity tissues. At the same time, the body has a protective effect of pigment deposition. After sunbathing, the skin changes to protect the skin from being destroyed by ultraviolet rays and can absorb ultraviolet rays, convert them into heat, and transport them into the body, stimulating the functions of various parts. In addition to the irritating effect of ultraviolet rays on the eyes, many occupational diseases, such as those who work in X-ray and artificial sun exposure, suffer from ultraviolet light irritation, causing eye inflammation, conjunctival inflammation around the eyes, and red, swollen, and painful eyelids. It can cause the cornea to become turbid. If it is more severe, it can cause the lens to solidify and become cataracts. Wearing brown, yellow, and black glasses can absorb ultraviolet rays and protect the eyes.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays also have benefits for the body, such as rickets, poor bone development, bone changes, and cartilage, which are mostly caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, resulting in impaired calcium and phosphorus metabolism. This is due to a lack of vitamin D in food, but a sufficient amount of this vitamin can also be obtained by ultraviolet irradiation. Because there is cholesterol in the body under the skin, it can be converted into vitamin D after being irradiated by ultraviolet rays. Therefore, more sunbathing can supplement the lack of vitamin D in food and prevent poor bone development.</p>
<p>(3) Infrared Rays: Infrared rays themselves have heat and can penetrate deep into the human body. This is related to the length of the light wave. Short light waves are easily absorbed, while long light wave infrared rays can penetrate the skin by several centimeters, stimulating physiological functions. Therefore, under unsuitable circumstances, many people suffer from heatstroke in the summer (infrared rays penetrate into the brain, and the brain becomes dizzy from the heat). Therefore, when working in the sun in summer, it is advisable to wear a white hat and not work for too long. In addition, prolonged exposure of the eyes to infrared rays can also cause cataracts and scotoma. This is mostly for those who work with fire or glass workers. Wearing blue or green glasses can absorb infrared rays and avoid diseases caused by infrared rays.</p>
<p>In our lives, we are constantly in contact with sunlight and need sunlight all the time. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to the hygiene of sunlight. We should often exercise in the sun, take sunbaths more often, and ensure that sunlight directly shines into our houses. Open the windows every day to allow sunlight to directly shine into the room to kill microorganisms. It is best to live in a place that is not low-lying, and the surroundings should have ample opportunities to receive sunlight. There should be adequate light when working, and the light should not be too weak or too strong. Shaking can damage eyesight. If you enjoy excessive sunlight, you should consider the age and apply it correctly to avoid damaging tissues and cells. When operating or walking in the open air in summer, wear a ventilated hat to prevent sunlight from directly shining on the head. When taking a sunbath, be sure to cover the head, and the time should not be too long. All these things need to be carefully considered.

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>"Skinny" is a common problem among children. Generally speaking, "skinny" means malnutrition. This is partly due to constitution, either natural or hereditary. Naturally, it is sometimes a symptom of a systemic disease, and being thin is just one of the symptoms. Some children are born weak or congenitally deficient. Most of their parents are physically weak and underdeveloped, or have tuberculosis or syphilis.</p>
<p>Malnutrition in children is mostly acquired. The main reason is neglecting the rules of daily hygiene or simply not understanding them. This is naturally the fault of the parents. The most important reason is improper diet. The food eaten may be insufficient, may not be suitable for the child's digestive capacity, or may lack the nutrients that children need to grow. For example, many parents let their children eat more meat, noodles, candies, and other such things. In fact, to ensure normal development in children, such foods should be reduced and replaced with milk, green vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Eating snacks, especially sugar and other sweet things, is most likely to cause indigestion, leading to malnutrition. Irregular eating times and insufficient chewing are also important causes of malnutrition.</p>
<p>Three meals a day are suitable for most children. Sometimes, a snack can be added between meals, such as hot soup or milk, bread or dry steamed buns with butter, but not too much. For children in families with heavier burdens, such as those with insufficient economic resources, soy milk can be used instead of milk. In any case, protein must be sufficiently supplied during the child's growth and development.</p>
<p>Being active is a child's nature, and normal activity is of great benefit to a child's physical and mental health. However, strenuous exercise must be prohibited, and there must be adequate rest during the day. Sleep for one or two hours in the middle of the day or afternoon. Go to bed early at night. Some parents often stay up late because of the theater or mahjong, and the children listen and watch, gradually developing bad habits of going to bed late and getting up late, which has a great impact on the physical and mental health of children. Parents must pay attention to correcting this.</p>
<p>In addition, fresh air and outdoor sunshine are also essential.</p>
<p>If the tonsils or adenoids in the throat are enlarged or inflamed, they should be removed. If there are decayed teeth, they should also be repaired or extracted. Whenever any defects or deformities are found in the child's body, they should be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>If parents pay attention to and improve the above points, then their children will definitely not be skinny.</p>

<h3>Village</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ye</p>
<p>River</p>
<p>The river flows slowly, flows...</p>
<p>The river is gentle, elegant, and peaceful. The river reflects the lives of the villagers entirely. The river brings happiness to the villagers.</p>
<p>In these hot days, the fields are parched after just a few days without rain. It doesn't matter, put the waterwheel into the river, and after pumping water for a while, the rice in the drought-stricken fields is saved.</p>
<p>The river is the villagers' natural wealth. Simply cast a net and pull it up, and you will find fish and shrimp. Flocks of white geese and mallards forage freely in the river, swimming freely.</p>
<p>The river watches over the village, watching over the lives of the villagers. The years in the village flow like the river, slowly, slowly.</p>
<p>Waterwheel Shed</p>
<p>The waterwheel shed sits idly on the riverbank, at the bend of the river. Beside the waterwheel shed stands a green willow tree.</p>
<p>Praying that God will help. In these hot days, let there be more rain, so that the villagers and livestock can save some energy and no longer have to brave the summer heat to pump water.</p>
<p>The south wind blows the green willow branches, swaying, and it is a good place to cool off in the waterwheel shed.</p>
<p>Wooden Bridge</p>
<p>The wooden bridge spans the river.</p>
<p>The wooden bridge is old and shabby. The wooden bridge has its own past of many hardships.</p>
<p>After dinner, shirtless, fanning a palm-leaf fan, I often come to the bridge with the village children to relax, sitting on the bridge planks, listening to them telling me about the stories they heard from their grandfathers about the bridge.</p>
<p>The villagers love the wooden bridge as they love themselves. The wooden bridge is the passage of the villagers' lives. The wooden bridge is the sympathy and help between the village and the outside world.</p>
<p>Boat</p>
<p>In the morning, it sails to the city, and in the evening, it returns from the city. Returning from the city, it brings various daily necessities, letters, and the day's newspapers.</p>
<p>The boat is the village's messenger, the villagers' great lover.</p>
<p>Small Teahouse</p>
<p>At night, the kerosene lamp is lit in the small teahouse.</p>
<p>At night, the small teahouse is open for business.</p>
<p>Shirtless, with a palm-leaf fan and a yellow tobacco pipe, the villagers all come to the small teahouse to drink tea.</p>
<h3>South Village Tune</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>The eldest son of Mr. Ma Gongyu, a epigrapher and painter, Da Hui, his second son Da Ren, and his daughter-in-law Wen Guang, all graduated from university and served in the rear for many years. Now they have all been assigned to study in the United States, and will take the "American General" ship to the West on the tenth of the month. I rely on "South Village Tune" to send them off. Playing the flute and tracing Fufeng, the odd number is entirely in the east; I envy Ji Yun's double excellence, at ease! There is also a husband and wife who respect each other. Broad learning requires deep study, it is the prime of life and your ancestry is prospering; Today the flywheel heads west, harmoniously! When the tiger returns, its own energy is strong.</p>
<p>After a hard day's work, they are exhausted. At this moment, they can relax their minds here and take a mental bath.</p>
<p>They drink tea, smoke, and gently fan themselves with palm-leaf fans. They talk about the weather, the year's harvest, and every small thing that happens in the village.</p>
<p>A large moon hangs on the big willow tree in front of the small teahouse, as well as a chorus of cicadas.</p>
<h3>What of Flowers</h3>
<p>— Kengqiang</p>
<p>Flower in a Greenhouse</p>
<p>The flower in the greenhouse has bloomed. I saw that it was the florist who forcibly peeled it open. Although the flower is still the same size as usual, its growth is, after all, deformed.</p>
<p>Its branches are soft and curved, like the legs of a child just learning to walk. Its color is also strange, like rouge on a prostitute's face. Although it is bright, it cannot conceal the anemic complexion under the torment of life.</p>
<p>It also has the shame of fearing the sun. Unlike the sunflowers growing in the fields, which dare to face the sun openly and honestly, it is like a new bride afraid of seeing her parents-in-law. Once it sees the sun, it can no longer raise its head.</p>
<p>The flower in the greenhouse has withered again. It blooms silently and withers silently. Who made it so miserable? The feeling of repentance prevents the florist's two fingers from knowing.</p>
<p>Wildflower</p>
<p>In the wilderness, a wildflower blooms stubbornly.</p>
<p>It has no man-made scaffolding to support it, nor any extra leaves to accompany it. It relies only on its own thin stem to stubbornly support it from blooming to withering.</p>
<p>There were such wildflowers on this day last year, but they were later eaten by the plowing cattle. Who would have thought that this stubborn little creature would actually be reborn a year later?</p>
<p>In the wilderness, the wildflower still blooms stubbornly. It is a symbol of the struggle for life!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>With a small, nimble movement, the spirit of the past, there were two hands stretched out from the outside, simultaneously opening the car door. Inside was the coachman's hand, and outside was the waiter, hurrying up to pull open the car door.</p>
<p>"Did you two come from the station?" the waiter asked Jiang Yaoqun and Little Tiger casually. Only his lips moved, but they were wooden.</p>
<p>"Isn't that right?" Yaoqun replied lazily as she followed Little Tiger out of the car. "Please tell the cashier to issue the fare."</p>
<p>"Yes, you," the waiter took the two small bundles from Little Tiger's hand. "Do you have any large luggage?" The waiter's voice was also wooden, without a trace of inflection. "Perhaps!" Yaoqun mumbled, seemingly intentionally making it difficult to hear clearly.</p>
<p>"Please, you," the waiter asked Yaoqun and Little Tiger to go first. The polite movements and posture were also wooden.</p>
<p>From one perspective, this wooden-type waiter, because he was too wooden, with his expression, tone, and actions all so monotonous, made people feel that this small encounter was too mechanical.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, although his appearance was wooden, it was just a manifestation of restraint. Inside, he seemed frighteningly cold. The wooden component contained extreme nervous tension, as if every nerve was trembling, every muscle cell was quivering, and at the same time, a kind of terrifying experience was forcibly suppressing his nerves and the muscles of his whole body, preventing them from twitching, so there was no expression.</p>
<p>Expression in this "area" is too dangerous. The slightest expression in speech or action is equivalent to revealing one's secrets. The consequences of this leakage are unimaginable. It may lead to three days and three nights of "exhausting interrogation," it may lose this slave-like "freedom," and be detained for three months, half a year, or even ten or eight years. It may be subjected to torture, whipping, waterboarding, electrocution, hanging...</p>
<p>The waiter's actions seemed contagious. Yaoqun, who was originally somewhat reserved, deepened her level of restraint immediately upon seeing the waiter's actions. Little Tiger, who had thought he had arrived at his destination in the car, had become somewhat active, but after being hit by the waiter's cold air, the happiness he had prepared was immediately frozen.</p>
